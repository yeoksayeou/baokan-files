Gansu Province's Water Conservancy Undertakings, Full of Revolutionary Spirit
By our reporter Gu Lei

                      (Continued from yesterday)
    (III) Adapting to Local Conditions, Launching a Thousand Arrows
    The geographical conditions, rainfall, climate, water sources, degree of drought, and methods of water conservancy vary greatly across Gansu. Some areas are extremely arid, some are generally arid, and a few places even experience flooding. This creates a complex situation, making it impossible to find a universal method to achieve water conservancy. Furthermore, the large area, heavy tasks, and small population create acute contradictions.
    How should this work be led? Should it be done locally, in a small-scale manner, or should a comprehensive, nationwide water conservancy campaign be organized? This seems like a matter of working methods, but in essence, it is a question of ideology. Because two different approaches represent two different leadership ideologies. This is a test of the Gansu Party organization, testing whether it dares to declare a full-scale war against drought.
    Gansu Province adopted a bold and comprehensive approach. In order to launch a water conservancy movement from every corner, the Provincial Party Committee repeatedly instructed Party organizations at all levels to go deep into reality, understand and grasp the natural characteristics and laws of each region, fully mobilize the masses, adapt to local conditions, fully utilize the "Five Waters" (rainwater, river water, groundwater, snow water, and ice water), utilize all possible conditions, advance simultaneously, bloom everywhere, create thousands of experiences throughout the province, use facts to establish the idea of "man will conquer nature," and launch a massive water conservancy movement. Over the past few years, all types of regions in the province have found a relatively complete set of methods for water conservancy construction.
    The first category is the "Hexi Corridor" and the Yinchuan area, which require large-scale irrigation. The rainfall here is only a few dozen millimeters per year; without water, there is no grain. The water source relies on the Yellow River and the snow water from the Qilian Mountains, which presents many contradictions. When water is needed, the water volume is insufficient; when it is not urgently needed, a large amount is lost, resulting in serious waste. To date, there are still large tracts of fertile wasteland that cannot be cultivated due to lack of water, and the soil of existing cultivated land has become severely salinized. The water conservancy task in this area is to increase water sources and reduce waste, store water and drain water, use water economically, leach alkali and drain salt, and prevent salinization. Yinchuan's methods include: digging ditches to drain groundwater, lowering the groundwater level, improving the soil, preventing salinization; renovating canals to reduce breaches in the canal banks, so as to avoid water loss; straightening old canals to improve irrigation efficiency; increasing the number of branch canals to reduce the size of land plots and increase the irrigation area. In the Hexi area, the effective methods include: investing a large amount of labor days to line the canals with pebbles to prevent snow water seepage; building low-lying reservoirs to store winter and spring surplus water for the needs of wheat in May and June; drilling a large number of free-flowing wells and semi-free-flowing wells to utilize groundwater and make up for insufficient surface water; leveling the land, reducing the size of land plots, and increasing the number of branch canals and field ditches to increase irrigation efficiency; implementing canal rotation based on crop types, concentrating water for irrigation, and reducing unnecessary irrigation water losses.
    The second category is the Bailong River and Xihan River basin area, that is, the Yangtze River basin south of the Qinling Mountains. The climate is warmer, and most of the area is mountainous with rocky terrain. The rivers are rapid, with an annual rainfall of 500 to 700 millimeters. The water source is abundant, mostly in the mountains. The temperature is lower and the rainfall is higher in the mountains, while the temperature is higher and the rainfall is lower in the river valleys. This creates the characteristics of "flooding becomes a river, drought becomes a mountain, neither drought nor flood becomes a half-mountain." In order to ensure a good harvest on the mountaintops, mid-slopes, and foot of the mountains, this area has also found effective methods: taking drainage and soil conservation measures on the mountaintops, digging drainage ditches to drain excess rainwater, reducing crop damage from flooding, and protecting the soil; digging ditches on the mid-slopes to intercept and divert small mountain streams, building connecting mountain ponds and small reservoirs to store summer and autumn rainwater for irrigation of terraced fields on the mid-slopes; opening canals in the river valleys to divert water to develop paddy fields and increase the multiple cropping index; building dikes to reclaim land along the shallow滩areas of the Bailong River to expand the cultivated area. Through these measures, it is possible to both resist drought and prevent flooding.
    The third category is the southeastern hilly plateau area, including the Wei River basin in the Pingliang and Tianshui areas and the southern part of Linxia. Eighty to ninety percent of the cultivated land here is dry land, and soil erosion is very serious. The annual rainfall is between 400 and 500 millimeters, often concentrated in the autumn. Because the rainfall here is not too little, the masses generally have a fluke mentality of relying on the heavens and do not have the habit of building paddy fields. The main measures now being adopted are: opening canals to divert stream water up the mountains; developing terraced fields and digging ponds to store water; building small reservoirs on small streams and rivers to store water for irrigation; drilling a large number of wells in the river valleys and universally developing water lifting irrigation.
    The fourth category is the central arid area, including the Dingxi area, the Gu'yuan and Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefectures, and the Yongjing and Dongxiang counties of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. The annual rainfall here is less than 300 millimeters, and even if it falls at the right time, it cannot meet the growth needs of crops. Water sources are extremely scarce everywhere, and soil erosion is particularly serious. There are very few rivers in the area, and most of the few small rivers are bitter water, which cannot be directly used for irrigation. Some counties even have difficulty with drinking water. This is the most arid area in Gansu, with 29 counties and cities, 550 townships, 1.85 million people, and 18.45 million mu of land frequently affected by disasters. In this area, water conservancy construction is particularly difficult, and there are particularly many methods: building field ridges and terraces to allow rainwater to infiltrate locally and increase soil moisture content; building leak-proof lined reservoirs to collect every drop of spring water and stream, using the method of small accumulation and large release to increase water land; searching for water sources everywhere in all river valleys, drilling a large number of wells, and widely using lifting tools to expand irrigation; in areas where both surface water and groundwater are scarce, building water cellars that can prevent seepage, evaporation, and retain water, storing autumn and winter rainwater and snow water, which are used to water the land the following year; in the rainy season, using floods and mountain streams to flood the fields, increasing the land's drought resistance; in winter, millions of people brave the cold to carry ice and snow to the fields to ensure spring planting; using furrow irrigation, small furrow irrigation, drip irrigation, and simple sprinkler irrigation methods to save water; vigorously developing sandy fields for drought resistance; advocating harrowing the land after irrigation to preserve moisture and prolong the land's drought resistance time; drilling deep wells and terrace wells, and universally using deep groundwater.
    From this, we can see that water conservancy work in Gansu is complex and arduous. At the same time, we can also see that after the comprehensive campaign, the people of Gansu have created thousands of methods for water conservancy construction in different regions. If drought is the most ferocious enemy of agriculture in Gansu, then the farmers of Gansu are determined to defeat this enemy by launching a thousand arrows. In this process, various typical examples have emerged in various regions, accelerating the pace of water conservancy construction. Taking the most arid Dingxi area as an example, before liberation, there were only more than 360,000 mu of water land. Due to the adoption of various methods for water conservancy construction, there are now more than 1.61 million mu of paddy fields. The average yield per mu of grain in the entire area has increased from 75 jin at the time of liberation to 136 jin in 1957. This year, the original plan was to build 540,000 mu of water land, but it has now increased to 2.24 million mu, and a plan has been proposed to achieve water conservancy in two years. The Dingxi area is a tall indicator of water conservancy in the province, and the time for water conservancy in other regions will only be shorter and not longer than that of Dingxi.
  (IV) Seven Combinations, Comprehensive Transformation
    Because mountainous areas account for 70% of the total area of Gansu, forest area accounts for only 6.4%, and soil erosion area accounts for nearly 50% of the total area of 530,000 square kilometers, the water conservancy construction work is further complicated. This situation sharply raises another question: facing this fragmented natural landscape, should water conservancy be carried out in isolation, or should various tasks be arranged starting from fundamentally changing the natural landscape at the same time as water conservancy construction? This is the dividing line between advanced plans and backward plans. Whether this question can be handled correctly is also a test of whether the Gansu Provincial Party Committee has revolutionary courage, whether it has the belief to overcome nature, and whether it has a strong desire to benefit the future generations of people once and for all. In a word, whether it has revolutionary drive.
    Gansu Province has taken a grand approach: starting from fundamentally changing the natural landscape, it has carried out a comprehensive plan, concentrated management, and comprehensive utilization. In order to accelerate the speed of transforming nature, they scientifically organized this work using the following methods:
    First, combine water conservancy construction with soil and water conservation and afforestation of barren mountains. The large amount of soil and water loss is an important cause of drought. Without maintaining soil and water, it is impossible to eliminate drought; because a large number of canals are opened to divert water, water sources are insufficient everywhere. Carrying out soil and water conservation and planting a large number of trees and forests can greatly increase water sources. In the past few years, these three tasks have been comprehensively combined in Gansu. This is a practice of fundamentally changing the face of nature according to the law of soil and water being connected and plants and trees growing together. As of the end of last year, the province had controlled soil and water loss in an area of 37,200 square kilometers, accounting for 16% of the loss area; afforestation and greening of mountains and ridges totaled 11.48 million mu, accounting for 1.43% of the total area. The labor days invested in this area are approximately 46.38 million. In this way, the day of realizing water conservancy is also the day of eliminating the harm of soil erosion and greening barren mountains, that is, the day when the natural face of Gansu Province is fundamentally changed.
    Second, combine large-scale projects with medium and small-scale projects. In the past few years, Gansu Province has resolutely implemented the central government's guiding principle of water conservancy construction of "small-scale projects as the main focus, medium-scale projects as auxiliary, and large-scale projects being built when necessary and possible." As a result, on the one hand, the speed of water conservancy construction has been accelerated under the condition that the state cannot invest a large amount, and cadres and the masses have been educated that Gansu can vigorously carry out water conservancy. On the other hand, it has also greatly facilitated the mobilization of the masses to participate in water conservancy construction more widely, because medium and small-scale projects have simple technology, small investment, and fast construction, and can generate benefits in the same year. In essence, this is a policy of relying on the masses to run water conservancy undertakings. Gansu Province has performed very prominently in this regard. Among the 8.01 million mu of new water land built during the first five-year plan period, 5.58 million mu were built with investment from the masses.
    Third, combine current interests with long-term interests. Whether it is water conservancy construction or soil and water conservation, there are long-term plans, focusing on fundamentally transforming the natural landscape, and also paying attention to the benefits of the current year. For example, the famous Dongliang Canal first had a plan to irrigate 30,000 mu of land and realize water conservancy in Dongliang Mountain, and used this vision to encourage farmers to start construction. During the construction process, it was carried out in two steps. The first step was to divert water to the mountain first, so that nearly 1,000 mu of land would benefit first, allowing the masses to see the benefits of building the canal; then the entire plan was realized. Another example is the "three-layer interlocking slope protection method" created by Dengjiabao in soil and water conservation work, which is also a typical example. Farmers first dig ditches and ridges on barren slopes, plant sour thorns, then sow sweet clover, and also plant soybeans in between. These three lines of defense can not only permanently prevent soil and water loss, but also harvest soybeans in the first year, cut sweet clover to feed livestock in the second year, and cut sour thorns as firewood in the third year. The biggest advantage of this combination is that the burden on the masses is small and it is easy to accept. Through many measures that can quickly obtain benefits, the realization of long-term plans is guaranteed. This is also the practice of focusing on the big picture, starting with the small details, combining the big and the small, from small to large, and "accumulating fur to make a robe."
    Fourth, combine cultivating typical examples, key demonstrations, and comprehensive promotion. This is a method of coming from practice and going back to practice, from point to surface, and typical examples driving the general. Because this is a new task and everyone has no experience, the province generally grasps four tasks for any type of typical example: key cultivation, organizing visits, continuous improvement, and comprehensive promotion. Taking the Tianshui area as an example, there were only three key points of this type in 1952, but by 1957 there were 367. Another example is Dengjiabao. Because the whole province paid attention to spreading their experience, more than 2,500 "Dengjiabao" have emerged, and it has been proposed that there will be more than 15,000 "Dengjiabao" in the province in 1958. Now, the whole province has all kinds of banners and can cite any representative experience for promotion.
    Fifth, combine construction and maintenance, comprehensive campaigns and perennial management. The vigorous development of water conservancy and soil and water conservation work is unprecedented in the past, and the workload is very large. When repairing, managing, and maintaining, a lot of labor is needed, which to a certain extent contradicts agricultural production. Some agricultural cooperatives often neglect one thing or the other due to improper arrangement of labor, disrupting the agricultural production plan, or causing poor engineering quality and waste, or causing some semi-finished water conservancy projects to collapse, which to a certain extent affects the enthusiasm of farmers. In order to solve this contradiction, 184 agricultural cooperatives in Gangu County have established perennial infrastructure construction teams, with a total of 7,924 laborers, accounting for 9.06% of the county's labor force. When there are large projects, more labor is organized to complete them in a concentrated manner. Small projects and daily maintenance tasks are contracted by the infrastructure construction team. The benefits of establishing a perennial infrastructure construction team are: making water conservancy and soil and water conservation work regular, eliminating seasonality; rationally arranging labor, no longer disrupting the agricultural cooperative's production plan; strengthening the management of completed projects so that they can function year-round; facilitating research, summarizing, creating, and promoting experience; creating reasonable construction quotas, eliminating idling and waste; due to specialization, it can concentrate forces to study and improve technology, ensuring project quality; the infrastructure construction team is a school for training peasant technicians anytime and anywhere, and can train more peasant technicians. This experience is being promoted throughout the province. The generalization of this experience will effectively strengthen the perennial construction of water conservancy and soil and water conservation, which can both consolidate existing achievements and continue to move forward.
    Sixth, combine private operation and public assistance. In the past, large-scale and technically complex projects were invested by the state. Medium and small-scale projects were mostly built by the masses through fundraising. Because the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction is very high, some large-scale projects have also been undertaken. Projects of this type sometimes encounter difficulties in terms of economy and technology. At this time, using the method of private operation and public assistance can do many more things. For example, the Beiyuan Canal built in Linxia County irrigates more than 90,000 mu of land and requires a total investment of more than 4 million yuan. It was quickly built with the state's assistance of 2 million yuan. Another example is the 300-li-long Beiliang Canal being built in Wushan, which needs to pass through the Wei River and requires the construction of an "inverted siphon." The province is prepared to provide technical and material assistance, which will also speed up the progress of the project. As a result, on the one hand, the state's funds can be used in the most urgent places and play a greater role; on the other hand, it can further encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation.
    Seventh, combine water conservancy, soil and water conservation with fundamentally controlling gullies,整治renovating channels, and fully utilizing field ridges, open spaces, pond edges, river滩land, improving saline-alkali land, and expanding cultivated area. In the past few years, through water conservancy and soil and water conservation, the cultivated area has been expanded by hundreds of thousands of mu (excluding reclamation), and another 2 million mu will be expanded in the next ten years. In this way, through water conservancy and soil and water conservation, not only has the existing cultivated land been improved, but also the grain planting area has been expanded, turning many abandoned lands into useful ones and increasing the income of the people. This is also an important condition for transforming the face of nature, because the utilization rate of the entire land area has been improved. (To be continued)

    充满革命精神的甘肃省水利事业
    本报记者　顾雷
                      （续昨）
    （三）因地制宜　万箭齐发
    甘肃各地地理条件、雨量、气候、水源、干旱程度、兴水利的方法等差异很大。有的地区最干旱，有的地区一般干旱，有个别地方还有涝灾。这就构成了复杂的局面，不可能找出一种通用的方法实现水利化。另外，由于地区大、任务重、人口少，也形成了尖锐的矛盾。
    怎样领导这个工作？是局部地、小手小脚地干呢，还是全面下手组织全民性的水利大进军呢？看起来这是个工作方法，实质上却是个思想问题。因为，两种不同的做法，代表着两种不同的领导思想。这是对甘肃党组织的考验，考验党组织敢不敢向干旱全面宣战。
    甘肃省采用了大刀阔斧、全面下手的办法。省委为了从各个角落掀起水利运动，一再指示各级党组织深入实际，摸清和掌握各地区的自然特点、规律，全面发动群众，因地制宜，充分利用“五水”（雨水、河水、地下水、雪水、冰水），利用一切可以利用的条件，齐头并进，遍地开花，在全省创造千万种经验，用事实来树立“人定胜天”的思想，掀起千军万马的水利运动。几年来，全省各类地区，都找到了一套较为完整的兴修水利的方法。
    第一类，“河西走廊”及银川一带，是大面积灌溉。这里的雨量每年不过几十公厘，没有水就没有粮食。水的来源，依靠黄河水和祁连山的雪水，其中矛盾很多，要用水时水量不足，不急用时大量流失，浪费严重。至今，尚有大片肥沃的荒地，因无水无法开垦，已有耕地土壤盐碛化严重。这个地区的水利任务是开源节流，蓄水排水，经济用水，洗碱排盐，防止盐碛化。银川采用的方法是：挖沟排除地下水，降低地下水位，改良土壤，防止盐碛化，整修渠道，减少渠堤缺口，以免水流失；对旧渠裁湾取直，提高灌溉效率；增修毛渠，减少地块，增加灌溉面积。在河西地区已行之有效的方法是：投入大量工日用卵石衬砌渠道，防止雪水渗透；修建洼地蓄水池，积蓄冬春余水，以备5月至6月小麦的需要；大量打自流井、半自流井，利用地下水，弥补地面水量不足；平整土地，改小地块，增开毛渠和地头沟，增加灌溉效率；实行按作物种类分渠轮作，集中输水灌溉，减少不必要的灌溉输水损失。
    第二类是白龙江及西汉水流域地区，即秦岭以南的长江流域，气候较暖，境内大部为石质山，河流急湍，年雨量五百至七百公厘，水源旺盛，多在山上。这里山上气温较低，雨量较多，河川气温较高，雨量很少，因此形成“雨涝成川，天旱成山，不旱不涝成半山”的特点。这个地区为了保证山上、山腰、山下都丰收，也找到了有效的方法：在山顶采取排水保土措施，挖排水沟，排除过多的雨水，减少作物受涝，保护土壤；在半山挖沟截引山溪小水，修连山湾塘、小型水库，储蓄夏秋雨水，灌溉山腰梯田；在河川开渠，引水发展稻田，增加复种面积；在白龙江沿岸浅滩地带，筑堤淤地，扩大耕种面积。通过这些措施，既可抗旱，又可防涝。
    第三类是东南部丘陵高原地区，包括平凉、天水专区的渭河流域及临夏的南部。这里的耕地80％—90％是旱地，水土流失十分严重，年雨量在四百到五百公厘之间，常常是集中在秋季落下。正由于这里落雨量不算太少，群众普遍存在靠天的侥幸心理，没有修水田的习惯。现在采用的主要措施是：开渠道，引溪水上山；发展梯田，挖塘蓄水；在小溪小河上修建小型水库，蓄水灌溉；河谷地区大量打井，普遍发展提水灌溉。
    第四类是中部干旱地区，包括定西专区，固原、吴忠回族自治州及临夏回族自治州的永靖、东乡两县。这里年雨量在三百公厘以下，即使适时降落，也不能满足庄稼生长的需要。各地水源异常缺乏，水土流失特别严重。境内河流很少，仅有的几条小河大都是苦水，不能直接用于灌溉，有的县连吃水都感到困难。这是甘肃最干旱的地方，经常受灾、受害的有二十九个县市、五百五十个乡、一百八十五万人口、一千八百四十五万亩土地。在这个地区，兴修水利的工作特别艰苦，办法也特别多：培地埂，修梯田，使雨水就地渗漏，增加土壤含水量；筑有防漏衬砌的蓄水池，收纳一点一滴的泉水细流，采用小聚大放的办法增加水地；在所有河谷地区遍寻水源，大量打井，广泛利用提升工具，扩大灌溉；地面水、地下水都缺乏的地区，修筑能防止渗透、蒸发、保水能力强的水窖，蓄存秋冬的雨水和雪水，第二年用来浇地；雨季，利用洪水、山溪漫田，增加土地抗旱能力；冬季，千万人冒寒往地里背冰、背雪，以保证春天播种；采用沟灌、小畦灌、点灌、简易喷灌等方法，节省用水；大量发展砂田抗旱；提倡灌水后耙地保墒，延长土地抗旱时间；打深井、台级井，普遍利用地下深水。
    从这里就可以看到甘肃水利工作是复杂的，艰巨的。同时，也可以看出全面进军以后，甘肃人民在不同地区创造了千万种兴修水利的方法。如果说干旱是甘肃农业最凶恶的敌人，那末甘肃的农民则用万箭齐发的方法，决心把这个敌人打倒。在这个过程中，各地区都出现了各种典型，加快了水利建设的脚步。以最干旱的定西专区为例，解放前只有水地三十六万多亩，由于采用各种方法兴修水利，现已有水田一百六十一万余亩，全专区粮食每亩平均产量由解放时的七十五斤提高到1957年的一百三十六斤。今年原计划修水地五十四万亩，现在已增至二百二十四万亩，并提出两年实现水利化的规划。定西专区是全省水利化的指高表，其他地区水利化的时间，只会少而不会多于定西。
  （四）七大结合　全面改造
    由于甘肃山区占总面积70％，森林面积只占6.4％，水土流失面积占总面积五十三万平方公里的近50％，就更使得水利建设工作复杂化了。这种情况，尖锐地提出了另一个问题：面对这个破碎的自然面貌，是孤立地兴修水利呢，还是与兴修水利同时入手，从根本上改变自然面貌出发安排各项工作呢？这是先进计划与落后计划的分界线。能否正确处理这个问题，也是考验甘肃省党组织有没有革命的胆略，有没有战胜自然的信念，有没有一劳永逸地为未来的世世代代人们造福的强烈愿望。一句话，有没有革命的劲头。
    甘肃省采取了气魄宏伟的做法：从根本改变自然面貌着眼，进行了全面规划、集中治理、综合利用的部署。为了加快改造自然的速度，他们用以下办法科学地组织了这一工作：
    第一，兴修水利同水土保持、绿化荒山相结合。水土的大量流失，是造成干旱的重要原因，不保持水土就无法消灭干旱；由于大量开渠引水，各地都感水源不足，开展水土保持、大量植树造林，就可以大大增加水源。几年来，这三个工作在甘肃是全面结合进行的。这是按照水土相连、草木相生的规律，根本改变大自然面貌的作法。截至去年底，全省已控制水土流失面积三点七二万平方公里，占流失面积的16％；植树造林和绿化山岭一千一百四十八万亩，占总面积1.43％。在这方面已投入的劳动日大约有四千六百三十八万个。这样，实现水利化的一天，也就是消除水土流失之害、绿化荒山的一天，也就是甘肃省自然面貌根本改变的一天。
    第二，大型工程同中小型工程相结合。几年来，甘肃省坚决贯彻了中央规定的“小型为主，中型为辅，必要和可能条件下兴修大型工程”的水利建设方针。结果，一方面在国家不可能大量投资的情况下，加快了水利建设的速度，教育了干部、群众，甘肃可以大兴水利。另一方面，也大大便利了更广泛地动员群众力量参加水利建设，因为中小型工程技术简单，投资少，建设快，当年就有收益。从实质上讲，这是个依靠群众办水利事业的方针。甘肃省在这点上表现的很突出，第一个五年计划期间新修的八百零一万亩水地中，有五百五十八万亩是群众投资修的。
    第三，当前利益与长远利益相结合。这里不管是兴修水利，或者进行水土保持，都有长远的计划，都着眼于根本改造自然面貌，同时也注意到当年的收益。例如，著名的东梁渠，先有了一个浇灌三万亩土地、使东梁山水利化的计划，并用这个远景鼓励农民动工修建的。在修建过程中，分两步走。第一步先把水引上山，让近千亩土地首先受益，使群众看到了修渠的好处；然后才实现了全部计划。又如，邓家堡在水土保持工作中创造的“三套连环护坡法”，也是一个典型。农民先在荒坡上开沟挖垅，栽上酸刺，再播种上草木樨，中间又点种黄豆。这三道防线不但可以永远防止水土流失，而且第一年可以收黄豆，第二年可以割草木樨喂牲口，第三年可以砍酸刺当柴烧。这种结合的最大好处是群众负担少，容易接受，通过许多能够很快得到收益的措施，保证了长远计划的实现。这也就是大处着眼，小处着手，大小结合，由小到大，“集腋成裘”的作法。
    第四，培养典型，重点示范和全面推广相结合。这是从实际中来又到实际中去、由点到面、典型推动一般的方法。由于这是一件新的工作，大家都没有经验，因而全省不管是对那一种典型大都是抓紧四个工作：重点培养、组织参观、继续提高、全面推广。以天水专区为例，1952年属于这类的重点只有三个，到1957年已有三百六十七个。再以邓家堡为例，由于全省注意传播了他们的经验，已出现二千五百多个“邓家堡”，并且提出1958年内全省要出现一万五千多个“邓家堡”。现在，全省已拥有各种各样的旗帜，可以举出任何一种具有代表性的经验加以推广。
    第五，兴修和维护、全面突击和常年治理相结合。水利事业和水土保持工作的蓬勃发展是过去历史上没有过的，工作量很大。在修、治和维护的时候，需要很多劳动力，这在一定程度上同农业生产是有矛盾的。有些农业社往往因安排劳动力不当而顾此失彼，打乱了农业生产计划，或者造成工程质量低劣、浪费，或者使某些水利工程半成品垮了，在一定程度上影响了农民的积极性。为了解决这个矛盾，甘谷县有一百八十四个农业社建立了常年基建队，共拥有劳动力七千九百二十四个，占全县劳动力9.06％。遇有大的工程，组织更多的劳动力突击完成，小的工程和日常维护任务，由基建队包下来。建立常年基建队的好处是：使水利和水土保持工作经常化，消除了季节性；合理安排劳动力，不再打乱农业社的生产计划；加强对已成工程的管理，使其常年发挥作用；便于研究、总结、创造、推广经验；创造合理的建筑定额，消除窝工浪费；由于专业化，能集中力量学习、提高技术，保证工程质量；基建队是随时随地培养农民技术员的学校，可以训练出更多的农民技术员。这一经验正在全省推广。这一经验的普遍化，将会有效地加强水利和水土保持的常年建设，既可巩固已有成绩又能不断前进。
    第六，民办和公助相结合。过去，大型的、技术复杂的工程都由国家投资。中型、小型的大都是群众集资修建的。由于群众兴修水利的热情很高，也举办了一些大型工程。属于这类的工程，有时会在经济上、技术上遇到困难，这时，采用民办公助的办法，可以多办很多事情。如临夏县修的北塬渠，浇地九万多亩，共需投资四百余万元，曾由国家援助二百万元很快就建成了。又如，武山正动工的长三百华里的北梁渠，要通过渭河，需要修“倒虹吸”，省里准备给予技术上和物资上的援助，同样会加快工程的进度。这样作的结果，一方面可以把国家的资金用在最急用的地方，发挥更大的作用，另一方面，可以更进一步鼓舞群众兴修水利进行水土保持的热情。
    第七，水利、水土保持和根治沟壑、整治渠道以及充分利用田梗、隙地、塘边、河滩地、改良盐碱地扩大耕地面积相结合。过去几年，通过水利和水土保持，已扩大耕地面积几十万亩（不包括开荒），今后十年内还将扩大二百万亩。这样，通过水利和水土保持，不但对已有耕地进行了改良，而且扩大了粮食种植面积，变许多被遗弃的土地为有用，增加了人民的收入。这也是改造大自然面貌的一个重要的条件，因为整个土地面积利用率提高了。　（未完）
