Learning Also Requires a Surge of Enthusiasm
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    In these days when mass movements are galloping forward and various tasks are leaping ahead in unison, the learning of staff members should also take a leap forward. Every comrade should treat learning like work, sweeping away the official airs, listlessness, arrogance, and squeamishness of the past, displaying enthusiasm, working hard for several years, and striving to become a cadre who is both virtuous and talented, "both red and expert." The development of the situation is advancing rapidly, various things are changing with each passing day, and the tasks of socialist construction are very arduous and complex. However, our experience and knowledge are very inadequate. Under such circumstances, whoever does not learn will fall behind, and whoever does not display enthusiasm will progress slowly. Now, even those comrades who are relatively slow to perceive, who speak irrelevantly all day long, and who lack a strong desire to improve, feel the pressure of the situation and know that they must brace themselves.

    What should we learn? This does not need much explanation. Everyone knows that studying Marxism-Leninism and studying politics are essential for all staff members. Politics is the commander, the soul, and the guarantee of professional work. Whoever lacks the command of the commander will lose their political direction, and whoever lacks a soul is not a real person. For some comrades who shoulder leadership responsibilities, their vision should be broader and more far-reaching. They should learn more and delve deeper. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao teach us to learn some philosophy, some economics, some history, some law, some logic, some grammar, and also some foreign languages, etc. These are all essential for a leading comrade, especially a high-level leading comrade. In addition, we must also study natural sciences and professional knowledge. Now we are engaged in socialist construction and carrying out a technological revolution. If we do not master science and technology, if we are not proficient in our own professional work, it will not work. Empty political talkers are very dangerous. With the development of the situation, the need to study these aspects is becoming increasingly urgent.

    Whether it is studying political theory or science and technology, there are difficulties, and it is not something that can be learned well overnight. Can we overcome the difficulties and learn well? Some comrades still have doubts about this issue. For example, some comrades say, "I am old and have a low level of education. I am afraid I cannot learn well!" Others say, "I am too busy with work and have no time. How can I learn?" Such thoughts are ideological obstacles. If we do not break down these ideological obstacles, it will be difficult to move forward with great strides on the road of learning.

    Being old and having a low level of education is indeed a difficulty. But this is not an insurmountable difficulty. Among the more than 300 veteran cadres studying at the Beijing Mining College, the Aviation College, and seven other higher industrial schools, most only have a junior high school education, and some have not even completed elementary school. However, because of their diligent study and hard practice, their academic performance is generally very good. In two and a half years or one and a half years, they can generally complete the courses that young students can complete in five or six years. In the near future, they will become experts. Perhaps some people will say, "They have good learning conditions in school, but it is very difficult to learn at work." In fact, this is not the case. We can see that in various industries and posts, there are many veteran cadres and young cadres with not very high levels of education. Because they have been learning while working for several years, delving deeply and practicing hard, they have mastered technology, become proficient in their profession, and become experts in their fields. For example, Song Tianxiang, deputy director of the Geological Department of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau, was originally a worker who was a "rough old fellow" and had not even attended senior elementary school. Because he mustered his enthusiasm, studied hard, went to bed late and got up early, and persisted unremittingly, he has now mastered the technical and professional work of the Geological Department, gradually changed from a layman to an expert, and has gained the respect of technical personnel. According to his experience: "Technology is not mysterious and unattainable. The fortress of science can eventually be conquered by those with ambition." Another example is Comrade Guo Xifen, director of the state-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory, who was a veteran cadre transferred from the countryside to the industrial construction post in 1951. After six years of hard work, he is now quite proficient in the enterprise management of cotton textile factories and has become an excellent red enterprise leader. According to his experience: "Managing an enterprise is like riding a horse. When you first get on the saddle, you will inevitably sweat more than the horse. But once you learn to ride, the horse will run very vigorously, and you will ride very comfortably." This shows that it is entirely possible to learn while working, and it is also possible to learn well. The question is whether you have the determination and ambition. If you are willing to learn, have the determination and ambition, display enthusiasm, work hard, study tenaciously, and study diligently, then you can overcome all difficulties and achieve something. Everyone knows that many of our central and provincial and municipal leaders have not attended middle school or university, and even fewer have studied abroad. However, because they are loyal to the revolutionary cause and have been learning while working for a long time, they have now become leading cadres who are red and expert. For example, among the members of the Party Central Committee, Comrades Tan Zhenlin, Li Xiannian, and Zeng Shan all started as apprentices. They have not attended university and have not received higher education, but now they have become experienced political activists. We should learn from their spirit of diligent study and hard work.

    Being busy with work and having little time is also indeed a fact. But the question is that we must squeeze out time to study from our busy schedules. Whether we can squeeze out time is up to the individual. As long as we are willing to learn and display enthusiasm, the definite answer is: we can. For example, some comrades chat for two or three hours, dance, watch plays, play chess, and play cards until late at night, but say that they have no time to study. This is of course unreasonable. Some comrades also have no plans for their work, their minds are not clear, they are busy and caught up in routine matters, so naturally they feel that they have no time to study. If we have a strong will, cherish our time very much, pay attention to improving our work methods, and arrange our time reasonably, we can always create conditions for learning and squeeze out some time to study. In ancient China, there were stories of people who collected fireflies in bags, used the reflection of snow to read, chiseled holes in walls to steal light, hung their hair from the ceiling, pricked their thighs with awls, carried firewood, and hung books on ox horns. This spirit of diligent study is worth learning from. In particular, great classical writers such as Marx, Engels, and Lenin were all very thrifty with time and good at managing time. Their work during their lifetime can be said to be much busier than ours, but they never interrupted their studies and writing, even under the most difficult conditions. Marx wrote "Das Kapital," researching tirelessly day and night, and spent forty years on it. Lenin was exiled to Siberia in 1897. Although it was very desolate and the conditions were extremely difficult, he still insisted on studying. During his three years of exile, he not only read and studied many books extensively and intensively, but also wrote more than 30 works, including famous works such as "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" and "The Tasks of Russian Social Democrats." Their spirit of hard study and indomitable perseverance is even more worthy of our learning.

    Of course, learning not only requires determination and ambition, but also correct learning methods. Chairman Mao said: "The important thing is to be good at learning." However, any good learning method can only be obtained in the practice of learning. At present, the learning of cadres, except for a few people who can go to school for further study, most people are on-the-job amateur learners. For this reason, everyone should adhere to various work posts, proceed from the needs of their work, proceed from their existing level, realistically formulate personal training plans, and then concentrate, proceed step by step, and learn step by step. Learning cannot be rushed. A trickle can converge into rivers and seas. Learning cannot be complacent. Pride and complacency are the enemies of learning. Only those who are honest, realistic, and always humbly learn can have a bright future. We must always remember Chairman Mao's words: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind." Whether it is studying political theory or science and technology, we must advocate independent thinking, oppose dogmatism, and learn with creative methods, that is, methods that combine theory with practice. In order to truly transform oneself from a layman into an expert, relying solely on books is not enough. We should use all possible opportunities to go deep into life, go deep into practice, participate in labor, participate in grassroots work, learn from workers and peasants, learn from grassroots cadres, learn from their production experience, learn from their work experience, learn from their labor perspective, and learn from their thoughts and feelings. In short, learning while working and closely integrating theory with practice are the most correct learning methods. Displaying enthusiasm, working hard, overcoming difficulties, and persisting in learning are the most correct learning attitudes.

    For many cadres to become red experts, it is of course mainly dependent on their individual consciousness and initiative, but the leadership and supervision of the Party organization cannot be lacking. All Party organizations must strengthen their leadership over the learning of cadres, help them formulate learning plans, promote a good atmosphere of studying hard, conduct regular inspections and supervision, implement evaluation and examinations, and do their best to help them solve the difficulties in learning, such as tutoring issues, time arrangement issues, book and material issues, and so on. Only by combining the conscious study of cadres with the active leadership of Party organizations can we ensure the rapid growth of our expert team.

    In this great era, everything is full of hope. Things that many people previously thought were impossible and unattainable have now become possible and attainable. Every comrade who has the conditions to study should brace themselves, have a learning plan, and be determined to strive to become a red expert in a few years to ten years. There are two old sayings in China: "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to rear a person." In fact, this is inappropriate, because it does not take ten years to grow a tree, and it does not take a hundred years to rear a person. Shouldn't we change these two sentences to "It takes ten years to rear a person, and a hundred years to grow a tree"?

    学习也要有一股干劲
    本报评论员
    在这群众运动万马奔腾、各种工作齐声跃进的日子里，工作人员的学习，也应该来一个跃进。每一个同志对待学习也要像对待工作一样，一扫过去的官气、暮气、骄气和娇气，发挥干劲，苦战几年，力争成为一个才德兼备的、“又红又专”的干部。形势的发展一日千里，各种事物日新月异，社会主义建设的任务十分繁重而复杂，而我们的经验和学问又都非常不够，在这种情况下谁不学习谁就落后，谁不发挥干劲，谁就进步迟缓。现在，就是那些感觉比较迟钝，终日言不及义，上进心比较不强的同志，也感到形势逼人，再不振作起来不行了。
    学习什么？这是不需要多说的了。大家都知道，学习马克思列宁主义，学习政治，这是一切工作人员所必需的。政治是统帅，是灵魂，又是业务的保证；谁没有统帅的指挥，那就要迷失政治方向，谁没有灵魂，那就不是一个真正的人。对于一些担负领导工作的同志来说，眼光更要开阔远大一些，多学一些，钻深一些。党中央和毛主席教导我们，要学点哲学、学点经济学、学点历史、学点法学、学点逻辑、学点文法，还要学点外国文等等。这都是一个领导同志，特别是高级领导同志所必须的。此外，还要学习自然科学，学习业务知识。现在我们搞社会主义建设，进行技术革命，如不掌握科学技术，如不精通本行业务，那是不行的，空头政治家是非常危险的。随着形势的发展，学习这方面的东西是越来越感到迫切了。
    不论学习政治理论和科学技术都是有困难的，不是一朝一夕所能学好的。能不能克服困难，能不能学好呢？现在还有些同志对这个问题存在着疑虑。例如有些同志说：“年纪大了，文化程度又低，恐怕学不好！”又有些同志说：“工作太忙了，没有时间，怎么学呢？”诸如此类，这都是一种思想障碍，如不打破这种思想障碍，很难在学习的道路上大踏步前进。
    年纪大、文化低，这确实是一种困难。但这并不是不可克服的困难。在北京矿业学院、航空学院等九所高等工业学校学习的三百多名老干部，多数只具有初中的文化程度，有的连小学课程也未念完，但是由于他们的勤学苦练，学习成绩普遍很好。他们以二年半或一年半的时间，大体上就能完成青年学生用五、六年所能学完的课程。在不久的将来，他们就要变成专家。也许有人要说：“他们在学校中的学习条件好，在工作中学习就很困难。”事实上并不是这样，我们可以看到，在各行各业的岗位上，有许多文化并不怎样高的老干部和青年干部，由于他们几年来边干边学，深钻苦练，已经掌握了技术，精通业务，成为本行的能手和专家了。例如西北煤田地质勘探局地质处的宋天祥副处长，原是一个工人出身的“大老粗”，连高小也没上过，由于他鼓起干劲，发奋学习，迟睡早起，坚持不懈，现在已经掌握了地质处的技术业务工作，渐渐由外行变成内行，并且得到了技术人员的敬佩。根据他的经验：“技术并不是神秘和高不可攀的，科学的堡垒终能被有志的人攻破。”再如国营西北第一棉纺织厂厂长郭希汾同志，是1951年由农村转业到工业建设岗位上的老干部，经过六年来的苦钻，现在他对棉纺厂的企业管理已经相当熟练，变成一个优秀的红色企业领导者了。根据他的经验：“管理企业好比骑马，当你初次上马鞍的时候，出的汗难免比马出的还要多。可是一旦学会了骑术，那马就跑得很起劲，你自己也就骑得非常舒服。”这都说明：在工作中边干边学完全是可能的，而且也是可以学好的。问题在于有没有决心，有没有志气。如果愿意学，决心和志气有了，发挥干劲，下苦功夫，顽强的学，勤勤恳恳地学，那就可以克服一切困难而有所成就。大家都知道，我们中央的和各省市的一些负责同志，许多都是没有进过中学和大学的，留过洋的更少，可是由于他们忠于革命事业，长期地边干边学，现在都已成为红透专深的领导干部。例如在党的中央委员中间，谭震林、李先念、曾山等同志都是从学徒出身的，他们都没有进过大学，没有受过高深的教育，可是现在他们都已成为有经验的政治活动家了。我们应当学习他们勤学苦干的精神。
    工作繁忙，时间不多，这也确是事实。但问题在于我们要从百忙中挤出时间来学习。能不能挤出时间来，事在人为，只要肯学，发挥干劲，肯定的回答：是可以的。例如有些同志闲谈起来就是两三个小时，跳舞、看戏、下棋、打扑克可以玩至深夜，但却说没有时间学习，这当然是没有道理的。也有些同志对工作没计划，头脑不清醒，忙忙碌碌，事务主义，自然也就感到没有时间学习。假如我们有坚强的意志，十分爱惜光阴，注意改进工作方法，合理地安排时间，总是可以创造学习条件，挤出一些时间来学习的。我国古人曾有囊萤、映雪、凿壁偷光、悬梁、刺股，负薪、挂角等故事，这种刻苦攻读的精神，是值得我们学习的。特别是像马克思、恩格斯、列宁……这些伟大的经典作家，都是非常珍惜时间和善于支配时间的，他们生前的工作可以说要比我们繁忙得多，但是他们从不间断学习和写作，哪怕是在最困难的条件下也是坚持不懈。马克思写作“资本论”，日日夜夜不倦地钻研，整整用了四十年的工夫。列宁在1897年被流放到西伯利亚，那里虽然十分荒凉，条件极为困难，而他却仍然坚持学习。在流放的三年中，他不仅博览和精读了许多书籍，而且写了三十多种作品，其中有“俄国资本主义的发展”、“俄国社会民主党人的任务”等有名的著作。他们这种刻苦钻研的精神和百折不挠的毅力，更是值得我们学习的。
    当然，学习不仅要有决心和志气，而且要有正确的学习方法。毛主席说：“重要的问题在善于学习”。不过，任何好的学习方法只能在学习的实践中才能得到。现在的干部学习，除了少数人可以进学校深造以外，大多数人都是在职的业余学习。为此，大家应该坚持各种工作岗位，从业务的需要出发，从自己的现有水平出发，实事求是地定出个人的进修规划，然后专心致志，循序渐进，一步一步地学习下去。学习是性急不得的，涓涓细流，可以汇成江河。学习是不能自满的，骄傲自满是学习的敌人，只有老老实实，实事求是，永远虚心学习的人，才能有远大的前程。我们要常常记着毛主席的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。不论学习政治理论和科学技术，都要提倡独立思考，反对教条主义，以创造性的方法，即理论联系实际的方法去学习。为了使自己真正从外行逐步地变为内行，光靠书本也是不行的。我们应当利用一切可能的机会，深入生活，深入实际，参加劳动，参加基层工作，向工人农民学习，向基层干部学习，学习他们的生产经验，学习他们的工作经验，学习他们的劳动观点，学习他们的思想和感情。总之，边干边学，理论密切结合实际，是最正确的学习方法。发挥干劲，下苦功夫，克服困难，坚持不懈地学下去，是最正确的学习态度。
    许多干部要成为红色专家，固然主要的是依靠个人的自觉性和积极性，但是也不能缺少党组织的领导和监督。一切党组织都要加强对于干部学习的领导，帮助他们制定学习规划，提倡认真读书的风气，经常检查督促，实行评比和考试，尽力帮助他们解决学习中的困难，如辅导问题、时间安排问题、图书资料问题等等。只有干部自觉的钻研和党组织的积极领导相结合起来，才能保证我们的专家队伍迅速地成长。
    在这个伟大的时代，一切大有希望，从前许多人认为不可能和做不到的事情，现在都成为可能的和做得到的了。我们每一个有条件学习的同志，都要振作精神，各有学习计划，下决心争取在几年至十年之内成为一个红色专家。我国有两句古话：“十年树木，百年树人”。其实这是不妥当的，因为十年不能树木，而树人也不需百年。我们应当把这两句话改成为“十年树人，百年树木”，那岂不更为恰当些吗。
