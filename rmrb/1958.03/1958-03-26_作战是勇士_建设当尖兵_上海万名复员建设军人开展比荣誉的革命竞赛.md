    Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Shanghai's ten thousand demobilized construction soldiers have launched a revolutionary competition to be pioneers and compete for honor.
    Recently, many demobilized construction soldiers in factories and enterprises have displayed the spirit of bravely annihilating the enemy, scaling the peaks of advancement. Fang Tiegong and twelve other demobilized construction soldiers from the Shanghai Solvent Factory collaborated with other workers to actively study and adopt new operating methods, accelerating the turnover of production equipment. This increased the daily output of a chemical reagent used to make calcium and plastics from 0.8 tons to 1.88 tons, exceeding their planned target for 1962. Cui Juemin, a demobilized construction soldier of the Volunteer Army, originally worked as a planer operator in the Zhongyuan Electrical Appliance Factory. Later, he heard that there was a shortage of manpower for the silicon steel sheet punching machine work for radio transformers, and that this work was prone to accidents and production did not increase quickly. He took the initiative to propose supporting the punching machine work, saying, "As long as we humbly learn from the experienced masters, difficulties and dangers cannot scare revolutionary soldiers." As a result, he came up with ways to save operating time and operate safely, increasing the daily quota of 4,000 silicon steel sheets per worker twice to 9,300 sheets, and bringing some comrades who could not even complete 4,000 sheets per day up to a quota of 7,000 sheets. Now, this tank driver from the Korean War is driving his machine with full confidence, rushing towards the daily output target of 12,000 sheets. In the China Automatic Telecommunication Equipment Factory and the Dachangyuan Iron Factory, the daily output of products by demobilized construction soldiers Zhang Tongyuan, You Yongcun, and Pan Yanji created the highest record in the entire factory.
    Demobilized soldiers are saving national construction funds like they saved bullets in battle. Jiang Chute, the factory director of the Tongyi Spinning Factory and a demobilized construction soldier, recently formed a socialist promotion team with all the demobilized construction soldiers and family members of revolutionary martyrs in the factory, serving as the team leader himself, and mobilized everyone to find ways to save funds. The repair and assembly of a lathe in their spare time alone saved the state 2,000 yuan. Chen Jusheng and Jiang Zhikang, demobilized construction soldiers working in the electrical equipment store, made rationalization proposals to relevant factories to modify nickel-containing materials, saving the state 160,000 yuan in nickel metal costs each year. Demobilized construction soldiers working in some non-production positions also advocated one person doing the work of two, and hiring fewer temporary workers to do various odd jobs.
    In the past five years, more than 2,000 demobilized construction soldiers in Shanghai have become advanced workers and activists in various socialist construction undertakings. On the 21st, the city's demobilized construction soldiers held a socialist leap forward conference. Xu Jianguo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and Major General Xiong Shaotang, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison, attended and spoke to encourage everyone to maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army and always be politically vigorous revolutionary soldiers. Finally, the conference unanimously expressed that this year, all demobilized construction soldiers should strive to become active members of socialism in their thinking and work. The meeting also adopted a resolution to launch a revolutionary competition with demobilized construction soldiers and on-the-job family members of revolutionary martyrs in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi.

### 作战是勇士　建设当尖兵  上海万名复员建设军人开展比荣誉的革命竞赛

    作战是勇士　建设当尖兵
    上海万名复员建设军人开展比荣誉的革命竞赛
    本报新华社专稿　上海市一万名复员建设军人展开了当尖兵、比荣誉的革命竞赛。
    最近，很多工厂、企业中的复员建设军人使出奋勇杀敌的冲劲，攀登先进的高峰。上海溶剂厂方铁公等十二个复员建设军人协同其他工人积极钻研，采取新的操作法，加速了生产设备的周转，使该厂一种用来制钙素、塑料的化学剂品的日产量，由零点八吨飞跃到一点八八吨，超过了他们1962年的预定指标。志愿军复员建设军人崔觉民原在中原电器厂担任刨床工，后来他听到做收音机变压器矽钢片冲床工作的人力不足，这项工作又易出事故，产量提高不快，他就主动提出支援冲床工作，并说：“只要虚心向老师傅学习，困难和危险吓不到革命战士”，结果，他想出了节省操作时间和安全操作的办法，把每天每工冲四千片矽钢片的定额，两次跳上了九千三百片，把一些原来连每天每工做四千片也不能完成的同志，带到七千片的定额；现在，这个朝鲜战场上的坦克驾驶员信心百倍地驾驶着他的机器，向完成一万二千片的日产额指标冲去。在中国自动电讯器材厂和大昌源铁工厂，复员建设军人张统元、游永存、潘延吉三人的产品日产量创造了全厂的最高纪录。
    复员军人像战斗中节省子弹一样节约国家的建设资金。统益纱厂厂长、复员建设军人蒋楚特最近把全厂的复员建设军人和烈军属组成一个社会主义促进队，自任队长，发动每个人想办法节约资金，仅是利用业余时间检修和装配的一台车床，就为国家节约二千元。担任电工器材商店销售工作的复员建设军人陈菊生、蒋之康，向有关工厂提出改制镍料器材的合理化建议，使国家每年节约镍金属的费用十六万元。在一些非生产岗位上工作的复员建设军人们还提倡一人做两人事，少招临时工包做各种勤杂工作。
    五年来，上海市有两千多个复员建设军人成为各项社会主义建设事业中的先进工作者和积极分子。21日，全市复员建设军人举行了社会主义跃进大会。中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长许建国和上海警备区副司令员熊少堂少将都出席讲话鼓励大家要保持和发扬人民解放军优良传统，永远作一个政治上朝气蓬勃的革命战士。最后大会一致表示要在今年内，使全部复员建设军人在思想上和工作中，都争取成为社会主义的积极分子。会上并通过向南京、杭州、苏州、无锡四个城市复员建设军人、在职烈军属开展革命竞赛。
