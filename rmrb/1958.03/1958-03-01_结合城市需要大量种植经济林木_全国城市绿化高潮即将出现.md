Launch a Mass Tree-Planting Movement to Green the Motherland at Top Speed
    See which provinces are making the fastest progress in greening!
    Editor's Note: The southern regions with higher temperatures have successively launched large-scale afforestation movements. This table shows the afforestation achievements of twelve provinces from January to around February 25th. With careful comparison, it can be seen that most provinces are working hard and making rapid progress in afforestation, and are accelerating their efforts. However, some provinces are lagging behind in afforestation, even far behind. In the future, we plan to publish the progress of afforestation in various regions every ten days. We hope that the lagging regions will catch up, and we also hope that the advanced regions will move forward even faster!
    
    Combining Urban Needs with Large-Scale Economic Forest Planting
    National Urban Greening Upsurge is Imminent
    (Xinhua News Agency, 28th) The National Urban Greening Conference held in Beijing concluded on the 27th amidst challenges and responses after three days of intense and enthusiastic discussions. This conference foreshadows a high tide of greening and a great leap forward in cities across the country soon.
    The conference believes that the past conservative and narrow views and handicraft methods in urban greening work have seriously hindered the comprehensive development of greening work and caused a lot of waste. The conference determined that the guiding principle for urban greening in the future is: oppose conservatism, oppose waste, let go and mobilize the masses, plant trees universally, and comprehensively green; at the same time, urban greening must be combined with production, planting more fruit trees, timber forests, and other economically valuable trees to directly create wealth. The conference called on cities of all sizes across the country to let go and mobilize the masses around the Qingming Festival to carry out a widespread mass tree-planting movement and achieve a great leap forward in urban greening; and it also required the formulation of plans to green the entire city within a few years. The conference also put forward the main requirements for how to implement the above principles and tasks: contracting by area, section, and household, inspection and evaluation, guaranteeing planting, maintenance, and survival; it is necessary to boldly liberate the conservative thinking on urban greening, break all rules and regulations, mobilize all the people in the city, and green all the places that can be greened, without wasting an inch of land, planting whatever can be planted, and planting grass where trees cannot be planted, to reduce wind, sand, and dust.
    After listening to the Shanghai representatives' introduction of their greening experience and the Beijing representatives' introduction of this year's greening plan, the representatives from Tianjin took the lead in launching a wave of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. Representatives from various cities sought out targets for each other, proposed conditions, and launched friendly competitions.
    The conference was full of revolutionary vigor, and the atmosphere was very active. Representatives from many cities repeatedly revised the greening plan indicators for their regions. Shanghai's original tree planting target for this year was 14 million trees. On the same day that the Tianjin representatives issued a challenge, the Shanghai representatives decided to accept the challenge after making a long-distance phone call back to report to their leadership. In addition to increasing the tree planting by 1.5 million trees, they also proposed to compete with Tianjin to see whose greening work served the city better and who had better economic benefits; Shanghai plans to plant tangerine trees and asked Tianjin to plant apple trees, so as to achieve self-sufficiency in certain fruits within ten years. The Qingdao representatives challenged the Beijing representatives, and the conditions also included providing some ornamental tree seeds to the capital.
    The representatives from Huainan City, Anhui Province, issued a challenge to coal mining cities across the country: to green the mining area in one year, ensuring a survival rate of over 98%, and to green barren mountains in two years. The representatives from Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, immediately accepted the challenge at the meeting, guaranteeing that two trees would be planted in front of every door and every window of every building, to realize the beautiful ideal of "an underground coal sea and an above-ground orchard." The representatives from Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, also accepted the challenge, proposing to create a twenty-mile-long fruit tree belt during the second five-year plan period, planting apple and peach trees to fully meet the needs of the coal miners in Xuzhou. The representatives from Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, also rose up to accept the challenge. Although this cold place only has a frost-free period of 140 days a year, they still guaranteed that everyone in the city would plant two trees this year and green the entire city in three years.
    The representatives from Wuhan City, according to local conditions, found three different targets in Shanghai, Changsha, and Hangzhou, and respectively proposed challenge conditions. Wuhan's East Lake will compete with Hangzhou's West Lake and strive to solve part of Wuhan's timber needs within ten years. The representatives from Jinan City, Shandong Province, said that they would use the heroic spirit of the People's Liberation Army fighting for the mountain tops with the enemy to overcome the barren mountains. They also challenged Hefei City, Anhui Province, to green the entire city within this year, making this city truly become a place of green trees and fruit gardens.
    Representatives from cities with lower original tree planting targets this year, such as Shenyang, Chengdu, and Chongqing, also stated at the meeting that they would break conservative thinking and learn from advanced cities. At this meeting, representatives from almost all cities proposed plans to green the city within one year and green the suburbs in two or three years. Moreover, the conditions of the competition fully demonstrated the spirit of socialist mutual support, mutual assistance, and fraternal love.
    The meeting was attended by representatives from eighteen provinces and autonomous regions, two municipalities directly under the central government, sixty-seven provincial-level cities, and units such as the Ministry of Forestry, the Forestry College, Tsinghua University, and the Chinese Horticultural Society, totaling 124 people.

　　掀起群众性的植树运动　用最快速度绿化祖国
    看，哪些省绿化进度最快！
    编者按：气温较高的南方地区先后开展了大规模造林运动，这个表就是十二个省从1月到2月25日前后造林的成绩。只要细心加以比较，就可以看出大多数省干劲大，造林进度很快，并且还正在加鞭往前赶。但是，也有一些省造林工作落在后头，甚至落后很远。今后我们准备每十天公布一次各地造林的进度，希望落后的地区要迎头赶上，也希望先进的地区快马加鞭！
    结合城市需要大量种植经济林木
    全国城市绿化高潮即将出现
    据新华社28日讯　在北京举行的全国城市绿化会议，紧张、热烈地开了三天，27日已在一片挑战应战声中结束。这次会议预示出，全国城市很快就要掀起一个绿化大跃进的高潮。
    这次会议认为，过去城市绿化工作方面的保守、狭隘观点和手工业工作方式，严重地障碍了绿化工作的全面开展，并且造成了不少浪费。会议确定今后城市绿化的方针是：反保守，反浪费，放手发动群众，普遍植树，全面绿化；同时，城市绿化必须要和生产相结合，多种果木树，用材林等有经济价值的林木，直接创造财富。会议号召全国大小城市在清明前后，放手发动群众，开展一个广泛的群众性的植树运动，来一个城市绿化的大跃进；并且要求制订几年内绿化全市的规划。对于如何执行上述的方针和任务，也提出了主要的要求：分片、分段、分户包干，检查评比，包种、包养、包活；必须大胆解放城市绿化上的保守思想，打破一切清规戒律，发动全市人民，把一切能够绿化的地方全部绿化起来，不要荒废一寸土地，能种什么就种什么，不能种树的地方也可种草，以减少风沙尘土。
    会议在听了上海市代表介绍的绿化经验和北京市代表介绍的今年绿化规划后，由天津市的代表带头掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮。各地城市的代表互找对象，提出条件，展开友谊竞赛。
    会议充满了革命干劲，气氛非常活跃。很多城市的代表一再修改了本地区的绿化规划指标。上海市今年原订植树指标是一千四百万棵，在天津市代表提出挑战的当天，上海市代表在打长途电话回去向领导机关请示后，决定应战，除增加植树一百五十万棵外，还提出要同天津比谁的绿化工作为城市服务得好，比经济收益；上海准备种柑桔树，要求天津种苹果树，在十年内做到某些水果自给。青岛市代表向北京市代表挑战，条件中并且提出要支援一些观赏树木种子给首都。
    安徽淮南市的代表向全国煤矿城市提出了挑战条件：一年绿化矿区，保证成活率在98％以上，两年绿化荒山。河南平顶山市的代表立即在会上应战，保证要做到在建筑物的每个门前、每个窗前各种两棵树，实现“地下是煤海，地上是果林”的美丽理想。江苏徐州市的代表也应了战，提出要在第二个五年计划期间造成一条二十里长的果树林带，栽上苹果树和桃子树，达到完全满足徐州市煤矿工人的需要。黑龙江鹤岗市的代表也起来应了战，虽然这个寒冷的地方全年只有一百四十天的无霜期，但是他们仍保证全市今年每人种两棵，三年全部绿化。
    武汉市的代表按照本地条件，找了上海、长沙、杭州三个不同的对象，分别提出了挑战条件。武汉市的东湖要和杭州市的西湖比赛，还要争取在十年内解决武汉市的部分用材问题。山东济南市代表表示，要以当年解放军和敌人争夺山头的英雄气魄来战胜荒山。他们并向安徽合肥市挑战，要在今年内绿化全市，使这个城市真正成为绿树成荫、花果成园。
    今年原订植树指标较低的沈阳、成都、重庆等市的代表，在会上也表示要打破保守思想，向先进城市学习。在这次会议上，几乎所有城市的代表都提出了一年绿化市内，二年或三年绿化郊区的计划。并且在竞赛的条件中，充分表现了社会主义互相支援、互助友爱的精神。
    出席这次会议的有十八个省和自治区、两个直辖市、六十七个省辖市等地区，以及林业部、林学院、清华大学、中国园艺学会等单位的代表共一百二十四人。（附图片）
