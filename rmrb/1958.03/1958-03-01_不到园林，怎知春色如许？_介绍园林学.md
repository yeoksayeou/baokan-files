    "If you don't visit the garden, how can you know how beautiful spring is?"
    ——An Introduction to Garden Studies
    Qian Xuesen
    When we visit our country's famous gardens, who doesn't feel proud of these precious legacies of our national culture? Who doesn't express respect to the working people who created these outstanding works? Take the Summer Palace in Beijing, for example. It is beautiful in itself. But when we look west at the peaks from the Knowing Spring Pavilion on the east bank of Kunming Lake, we feel that the layout of the entire garden is like absorbing the Western Hills, which are not originally within the garden, as a component of the overall landscape. Such magnificent spirit is rarely seen anywhere else in the world, I am afraid. The characteristic of Chinese gardens is the contrast between the regular shapes of buildings and the irregular shapes of rocks and trees; the layout is sparse and dense, symmetrical and asymmetrical, but overall it is harmonious. It can also be said that there is change in balance, and balance in change, a kind of dynamic balance. In this regard, we can also compare our gardens with our traditional landscape paintings or flower paintings. The beauty lies in being like nature but not exactly like nature. It is a further processing of nature, a creation based on the refinement of natural beauty.
    Most gardens in other countries in the world mainly use buildings, supplemented by trees; or they are limited to plane layouts without three-dimensional arrangements. Our gardens, however, utilize the terrain, transform the terrain, and thus break through the plane; and our gardens achieve their effect by integrating buildings, rocks, trees, and so on. If we say that gardens in other countries are extensions of buildings, their garden design is an appendage of architectural design, and their garden studies are a branch of architecture; then, our garden design is more comprehensive than architectural design, and our garden studies are not a branch of architecture, but an art discipline that occupies an equal position with it.
    That being said, garden studies also has a point that is very similar to architecture: that is, both disciplines are between pure art and engineering technology, and are art disciplines based on engineering technology. To build a lake, one must know the local water level, soil permeability, source flow, water surface evaporation, etc.; to build a mountain, one must have knowledge of soil mechanics, knowing under what circumstances walls need to be added to prevent collapse. To afforest and use trees, we must know the habits and ecology of each tree species. In short, garden design requires knowledge of natural sciences and engineering technology. We might call garden experts "art engineers".
    Our country's garden studies are a bright pearl in the cultural heritage of the motherland. Although in the past it served feudal lords, in the new era it can still serve the broad masses of the people and beautify their lives. And in fact, our country is carrying out large-scale construction, which also includes many places for people's cultural recreation; some of the old gardens are also being renovated. How to do this work well requires us to study and master our country's garden studies and apply it to this work. Therefore, sorting out our country's garden studies is also a practical need. Moreover, our existing scholars who specialize in traditional garden design are not young anymore. If we don't ask them to pass on their knowledge to the younger generation, it will cause a loss to our culture.
    Of course, our country's garden design is not just a matter of inheriting the past. In the new society, new environment, and new era, it will raise new demands, and thus enrich the content of garden studies. We can use the bridge separating Beihai and Zhongnanhai in Beijing as an example. This bridge was very narrow in the feudal dynasty, perhaps enough for the emperor's procession to pass. But when the people became masters of their own affairs, the people's ranks and pace became much larger, and the original narrow bridge was not enough. When expanding this bridge, some people may shake their heads and sigh, feeling melancholy; in fact, these people are wasting their thoughts. The expanded bridge is more beautiful than the old bridge, and its heroic spirit is beyond the imagination of the emperors. In addition, there is another reason why garden design is bound to have greater development: since what limits garden design are the conditions of engineering technology, and engineering technology is constantly developing with time; what was impossible yesterday is possible today; and what is impossible today may be possible tomorrow. Garden design will never remain on the basis of predecessors, and garden studies will continue to develop in new ways.
    It seems that we have not done enough work in the field of garden studies. Although we have done some investigation and research, it seems that only the Urban and Residential Area Greening major at Beijing Forestry University is focused on the most important aspect of cultivating young garden designers. Even this only major actually focuses on greening construction, which seems to be somewhat distant from inheriting and carrying forward our country's traditional garden studies as we discussed earlier. Therefore, we should consider the development of our country's garden studies more broadly and deeply. As long as we organize and carry out this work in a planned way, this pearl in our national cultural heritage will surely shine with unprecedented brilliance!

    “不到园林，怎知春色如许？”
    ——介绍园林学
    钱学森
    当我们到我国的名园去游览的时候，谁不因为我们具有这些祖国文化的宝贵遗产而感到骄傲？谁不对创造这些杰出作品的劳动人民表示敬意？就以北京颐和园来说，它本身已经是美妙了，但当我们从昆明湖东岸的知春亭西望群峰，更觉得全园的布置很像把本来不在园内的西山也吸收进来了，作为整体景象的一个组成部分。这种雄伟的气概怕在全世界任何别的地方很少见到的吧。我国园林的特点是建筑物有规则的形状和山岩、树木等不规则的形状的对比；在布置里有疏有密，有对称也有不对称，但是总的来看却又是调和的。也可以说是平衡中有变化，而变化中又有平衡，是一种动的平衡。在这一方面我们也可以用我国的园林比我国传统的山水画、或花卉画，其妙在像自然又不像自然，比自然界有更进一层的加工，是在提炼自然美的基础上又加以创造。
    世界上其他国家的园林，大多以建筑物为主，树木为辅；或是限于平面布置，没有立体的安排。而我国的园林是以利用地形，改造地形，因而突破平面；并且我们的园林是以建筑物、山岩、树木等综合起来达到它的效果的。如果说：别国的园林是建筑物的延伸，他们的园林设计是建筑设计的附属品，他们的园林学是建筑学的一个分支；那么，我们的园林设计比建筑设计要更带有综合性，我们的园林学也就不是建筑学的一个分支，而是与它占有同等地位的一门美术学科。
    话虽如此，但是园林学也有和建筑学十分类似的一点：这就是两门学问都是介乎纯美术和工程技术之间的，是以工程技术为基础的美术学科。要造湖，就得知道当地的水位，土壤的渗透性，水源流量，水面蒸发量等；要造山，就得有土力学的知识，知道在什么情形下需要加墙以防塌陷。我们要造林用树，就得知道各树种的习性，生态等。总之，园林设计需要有关自然科学以及工程技术的知识。我们也许可以称园林专家为美术工程师吧。
    我国的园林学是祖国文化遗产里的一粒明珠。虽然在过去的岁月里它是为封建主们服务的，但是在新时代中它一样可以为广大人民服务，美化人民的生活。而且实际上我们国家正在进行大规模的建设，其中也包括了不少人民文化休息的场所；旧有的园林也有部分在改建。怎样把这一项工作做得好，就要求我们研究并掌握我国园林学，把它应用到这项工作里来。所以整理我国园林学也是一件实际上有需要的事。况且我们现有的几位在传统园林设计有专长的学者又都不是年青的人了，再不请他们把学问传给年青的后代，就会造成我国文化上的损失。
    当然，我国的园林设计还不只是一个承继以往的问题，在新的社会、新的环境、新的时代对它会提出新的要求，也就因而把园林学的内容更加丰富起来。我们可以用分隔北京城里北海和中南海的桥作例，这座桥在封建王朝的时候是很窄的，给帝王的行列走走也许是够了。可是到了人民自己作主的时代，人民的队伍和步伐要壮大得多，原来的窄桥就不够用了。在扩建这座桥的时候，也许有人会摇头叹气，不胜惆怅；其实这些人都白花心思了，扩建后的大桥比旧桥更美丽，而其豪迈的气魄也非皇帝们所能想像得出的。此外，园林设计之所以必然会有更大的发展还有另一个原因：既然限制园林设计的是工程技术的条件，而工程技术是随着时间在不断发展的；昨天不可能的事，今天就行了；而今天不可能的事，也许明天就行了。园林设计也决不会停留在前人的基础上的，园林学还是要继续有新发展。
    我们在园林学方面的工作看来做得还不够。我们虽然做了一些调查研究，但是在最重要的培养青年园林设计师方面，似乎只有在北京林学院里的一个城市及居民区绿化专业。就连这个仅有的专业其实内容也是偏重绿化建设，与我们在前面所讲的承继并发扬我国传统的园林学看来还有些距离。所以我们应该更广泛地和更深刻地来考虑发展我国园林学的问题。只要我们组织起来，有计划地开展这项工作，我国民族文化遗产中这粒明珠一定会放出前所未有的光彩！
