    Appropriate Reporting on Activities in the Industrial and Commercial Circles

    Every time we open the People's Daily and see the stream of good news from all fronts, it seems as if we can hear the footsteps of the motherland's daily leap forward from the newspaper. However, what we regret is that we rarely see reports on activities in the industrial and commercial circles. In fact, with the extensive and in-depth development of the rectification movement, industrialists and businessmen across the country are undergoing a fundamental transformation, both politically and ideologically, to break with capitalism and establish socialism. This is a fundamental and major change. Therefore, I hope that the People's Daily will appropriately strengthen its coverage of the industrial and commercial circles in the future as needed, which will greatly encourage industrialists and businessmen across the country.

    适当报道工商界的活动
    我们每次打开人民日报，看到各个战线上捷报频传，似乎从报纸上能听到祖国每天跃进的脚步声。可是令我们遗憾的是很少能看到有关工商界的活动报道。事实上，全国工商业者随着整风运动广泛深入的开展，正在经历着一个破资本主义立社会主义的政治上和思想上的社会主义改造。这是一场根本性的大变革。因此我希望人民日报今后按照需要适当加强工商界方面的报道，那将会给全国工商业者以莫大鼓舞。
