    Henan Daily News: One hundred and thirteen counties and cities in Henan Province have successively entered the rectification phase centered on anti-waste and anti-conservatism.

    The flames of anti-waste and anti-conservatism in county-level organs initially targeted the bureaucratic air and lethargy of certain leading cadres and state functionaries who were not deeply involved in reality, had short-sighted views, lacked political responsibility, and did not cherish state property. For example, when the Xiuwu County Grain Bureau carried out basic construction at the railway station grain store, due to the lack of prior surveying and the leaders making decisions based on subjective wishes, the warehouse was built in a low-lying area. Last summer, grain had to be transported out by boat, which not only caused significant material waste but also prevented the newly built warehouse from fulfilling its due utilization rate. The Xixian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased two hundred waterwheels from Zhengzhou last August. Because the personnel responsible for transportation lacked a high sense of responsibility, ten waterwheels worth 1,200 yuan were dropped into the Shahe River. However, the leaders of the cooperative did not pay attention to this matter and did not organize people to salvage them. To this day, these ten waterwheels are still submerged at the bottom of the river. The Guangshan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative exposed the serious right-leaning conservative thinking of the leadership in planning procurement. For example, last year they only planned to purchase 250,000 jin of cotton, but they actually purchased 630,000 jin. In the first quarter of this year, the original plan was to purchase 6,000 jin of cotton, but in just forty-five days, they purchased 23,000 jin. Cadres of the Xixian County Agriculture Bureau revealed that under the influence of the leaders' extravagant bourgeois thinking, they made two new desks for each of the twenty-four people in the entire office, including the nanny and the communication clerk. In order to promote the widespread and in-depth development of the movement, many counties have adopted various forms such as holding exhibitions of physical objects, cartoons, and charts, visiting and comparing advanced and backward units, and holding report meetings or experience exchange meetings, all of which have had good results.

    While widely launching a high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, all counties have universally launched a mass-based competition movement to compare advanced, compare more, faster, better, and more economical. In addition to all counties and units universally formulating ambitious Great Leap Forward plans in light of the specific conditions of their respective regions and departments, many staff members have proposed specific plans to study hard, improve their work style, and actively adapt themselves to the Great Leap Forward situation. Some have already made changes in their actual actions. The Kaifeng County People's Hospital reformed the outpatient system, changing to a three-shift system from the end of February, abolishing the emergency registration system to ensure that those who arrive early are seen early, those who arrive late are seen late, and that work is carried out as usual on Sundays and other holidays. Many counties have begun to implement the provincial party committee's rectification method of "going down and coming up." In the Xinyang area, the county party committee offices and production offices of twelve counties have moved to townships and communes to work. Many counties have drawn two-thirds or three-quarters of their cadres to go to the countryside and to the production front to lead water conservancy construction and spring plowing, to conduct criticism and self-criticism and rectification on the spot, and to communicate with cadres remaining in the organs, promote each other, and continuously deepen the movement. In addition, according to statistics from twenty-eight counties, 10,774 cadres have cultivated 8,616 mu of experimental fields and are now actively fertilizing and cultivating them. These experimental fields were all established under the specific leadership of the county party committee secretary and responsible cadres of various departments.

### 河南各县燃起双反烈火  遍烧官风暮气

    河南各县燃起双反烈火
    遍烧官风暮气
    本报讯  河南日报消息：河南省已有一百一十三个县市先后进入以反浪费反保守为中心的整改阶段。
    县级机关反浪费反保守的烈火，一开始就燃及某些领导干部和国家工作人员不深入实际、眼光短浅、缺乏政治责任心和不爱护国家财物的官风、暮气。如修武县粮食局在车站粮店进行基本建设时，因事前未进行勘测，领导上凭主观愿望决定施工，结果把库房盖在洼地里，去年夏季坐着小船往外运粮，不仅造成物资上的很大浪费，也使新建仓库不能发挥它应有的利用率。息县供销社去年8月从郑州购买二百部水车，因负责运输人员缺乏高度负责精神，把价值一千二百元的十部水车掉到沙河里了，而社的领导上对这件事也不重视，没有组织人去打捞，直到现在这十部水车还浸在河底。光山县供销社揭发出由于领导上脱离实际，在计划收购方面的严重右倾保守思想。如去年只计划收购二十五万斤棉花，结果收购了六十三万斤；今年第一季度原计划收购棉花六千斤，结果仅四十五天就收购了二万三千斤。息县农业局的干部揭发领导上在讲阔气的资产阶级思想支配下，给全机关的二十四个人各做了两张新桌子，连保姆、通讯员每人也用两张新桌子。为促进运动广泛深入地发展，许多县采取了举办实物、漫画、图表展览，到先进和后进单位参观评比，举行报告会或经验交流会等多种多样的形式，效果都很好。
    在广泛掀起反浪费反保守高潮的同时，各县普遍掀起了群众性的比先进、比多快好省的竞赛运动。除各县各单位普遍结合本地区、本部门的具体情况制定出雄伟的大跃进规划之外，许多工作人员提出了努力学习、改进工作作风、积极使自己适应大跃进形势的具体计划，有的已在实际行动中有了转变。开封县人民医院改革了门诊制度，从2月底起改为三班制，废除急诊挂号制，保证做到早到早看，晚到晚看，星期天和其它假日照常上班。许多县已经开始执行省委关于“下去上来”的整改方法。信阳地区已有十二个县的县委办公室和生产办公室，搬到乡、社办公；许多县都抽出三分之二或四分之三的干部到农村、到生产战线上去，领导水利建设和春耕生产，就地鸣放，就地整改，并和留在机关的干部互通情况，互相推动，使运动不断深入发展。另外，据二十八个县的统计，已有一万零七百七十四个干部，搞了八千六百一十六亩试验田，现在正在积极进行施肥耕作。这些试验田，都是在县委书记与各部门负责干部具体领导下建立的。
