Promoting New Methods for the Masses
\tJiang Hao
The farmers of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative of Hexing Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, are using the wild plant "Datupo Wanhua" (破碗花花) to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, turning a poisonous weed into service for mankind and production. This is a new discovery and creation. This discovery and creation once again demonstrates the infinite wisdom of the people and inspires people to seek more treasures from nature.
Eliminating the Four Pests is an important aspect of mankind's great war to conquer and transform nature. In the battle between humans and the Four Pests, enthusiasm is necessary, but so is wisdom. We must be good at discovering and utilizing the power of nature.
In nature, many animals and plants can be used as medicines to eliminate the Four Pests. Besides Sichuan's "Datupo Wanhua", the masses have discovered similar solutions in almost every province. For example, in southern provinces such as Fujian, the masses use the wild plant Longshilan to kill maggots, and use turtle shells and bat droppings to smoke and kill mosquitoes. Shandong Province uses tobacco stalks to kill maggots, and Zhejiang and Jiangxi use tea seeds to kill maggots... These methods have been effectively spread in various places and have varying degrees of scientific validity. Moreover, these things are locally sourced, saving money, simple and easy to implement.
In order to accelerate socialist construction, not only in the elimination of the Four Pests should we learn from Pixian County's approach, promptly studying and promoting the new discoveries and creations of the masses, but also in production, education and other aspects, we must discover and seize upon the new discoveries and creations of the masses and promptly study and promote them.

    推广群众新方法
    江浩
    四川省郫县合兴乡红光农业社农民，利用野生植物“打破碗花花”消灭蚊蝇，使毒草为人类服务、为生产服务，这是一个新的发现和创造。这一发现和创造，再一次地表明了人民群众的无穷智慧，也启发人们向自然界寻取更多的宝物。
    除四害是人类征服自然改造自然的伟大战争的一个重要方面。人和四害作战，有了干劲，还必要有智慧。要善于发现和利用自然界的力量。
    在自然界，有好多动物植物可以利用作为消灭四害的药物。群众已经发现的，除四川的“打破碗花花”以外，差不多在各省都有发现。如在福建等南方各省，群众利用野生植物龙时兰灭蛆，用鳖甲和蝙蝠粪便熏烟灭蚊，山东省利用烟梗杀蛆，浙江、江西等地利用茶子灭蛆……。这些办法在各地传播，已行之有效，并有其不同程度的科学性。而且，这些东西都是就地取材，省钱又简便易行。
    为了加速社会主义建设，不仅在消灭四害方面，我们要学习郫县的做法，对群众新的发现和创造，及时地加以研究推广，而且在生产、教育等各方面也要发现和抓住群众中的新的发现和创造及时地加以研究推广。
