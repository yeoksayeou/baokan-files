The Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Catholic Patriotic Association recently issued a letter of proposal to the Preparatory Committees of the Catholic Patriotic Associations of Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provinces and the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Christian Church in Fujian Province, proposing to deepen the socialist education competition.

The conditions for the competition are: In addition to faithfully accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely following the socialist road, and loving the country and abiding by the law, it is also necessary to mobilize all priests, nuns in service, and church and patriotic association staff to actively participate in agricultural labor, study current affairs and policies, actively participate in various political movements, do a good job in various central tasks, and elect bishops in all dioceses throughout the province before the end of May this year to thoroughly realize the church's independence, autonomy, and self-management.

This proposal was unanimously approved at the second preparatory committee meeting held in Fuzhou from March 7th to 14th.
