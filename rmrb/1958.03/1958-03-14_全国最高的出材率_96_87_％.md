Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 13th: Employees of the Wuhan First Construction Company's Lumber Processing Plant created a national record on the 12th, achieving a lumber yield rate of 96.87%. This record is 31.3% higher than the prescribed target.

Last year, the plant's highest lumber yield rate was 67%. During the Double-Anti Movement, all the plant's employees humbly learned from the advanced lumber processing experience of fraternal factories across the country. The plant's Party and government leaders also worked with technicians and workers to study methods for improving the lumber yield rate. In lumber processing, they broke with convention, changing the previous method of using specialized materials for specific purposes to a "mixed lumber processing" method. As a result, in addition to manufacturing specialized materials, they could also manufacture other useful building materials, greatly improving the lumber yield rate.

    全国最高的出材率——96.87％
    新华社武汉13日电  武汉第一工程公司木材加工厂职工在12日创造木材出材率达到96.87％的全国纪录。这个纪录高出规定指标31.3％。
    这个厂去年木材出材率最高的时候是67％。在双反运动中，全厂职工虚心学习国内兄弟工厂的先进制材经验；厂的党政领导干部也和技术人员、工人一起研究提高出材率的办法。他们在制材中打破常规，把过去专材专用的制材方法，改为“混合制材”法。结果，除制造出专用的材料外，还能制造出其他有用的建筑材料，使出材率大大提高。
