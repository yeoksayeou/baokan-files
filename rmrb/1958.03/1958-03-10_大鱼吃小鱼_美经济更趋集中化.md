    美经济更趋集中化
    新华社8日讯  据塔斯社纽约7日讯：美国田纳西州民主党参议员克弗维尔在参议院发表演说，他列举材料证明，美国经济更趋集中化。
    他说，据众议院垄断问题委员会进行的调查，从1947年到1954年期间，五十家美国大公司的产品占美国工业的全部产品总值的份额从18％上升到23％，一百家大公司的份额从28％上升到30％，而二百家大公司的份额从30％上升到37％。他说，在许多工业部门里，三、四家大公司占全行业的全部产品总值的一半甚至四分之三。克弗维尔强调指出，在资本积聚的过程中，大批小公司和小企业纷纷破产或者被大公司吞并了。倒闭的企业从1956年上半年的六千四百九十六家增加到了1957年上半年的七千零八十九家。
