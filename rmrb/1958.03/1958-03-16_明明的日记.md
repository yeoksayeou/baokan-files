    Mingming's Diary
    I woke up, opened my eyes, and saw such a bright sun outside the window, and two little birds were singing on the branches.
    I suddenly remembered why I hadn't seen Grandma yet. I quickly called out, "Grandma, Grandma." Grandma came running. Mom was just about to leave for work. Grandma said, "Mingming is four years old today, it's his birthday, buy some candy when you come back!" Mom agreed, and also said she would buy me a picture book. I was so happy that I jumped out of bed and shouted, "I love to read picture books!"
    In the evening, Grandma washed my face. My face was chapped from the wind, and it hurt when she washed it. I cried and said, "Mingming doesn't want to wash his face, Mingming doesn't want to wash his face." Grandma scared me by saying, "If you don't wash your face, when you're asleep, a big bear will come and lick your face. The big bear has a big red tongue with thorns on it!" I was terrified. I quickly cried and said, "Don't let the big bear lick Mingming's face, let the big bear lick Grandma's face." Mom came over and said, "Good children wash their faces, it's so dirty if you don't wash your face!" She pulled me over and gently washed my face. I crawled into bed, thinking the big bear wouldn't lick my face.
    I asked Grandma for a red pencil, wanting to draw a big goldfish. But Grandma didn't give me any paper, what should I do? I suddenly thought it would be nice to draw it on the wall, so I picked up the pencil and drew a big goldfish, then quickly ran to call Grandma to come and see. When Grandma saw it, she got angry, didn't praise me for drawing well, and said, "Look at you drawing everywhere, so naughty!" She picked up a towel and wiped the goldfish off. I started crying anxiously. Grandma glared at me and even threatened to hit me.
    In the evening, I told Mom. Mom said, "I'll order a sketchbook for Mingming." She found a stack of paper, cut it, and bound a sketchbook. I was extremely happy.
    I was looking at picture books with my neighbor, Little Fatty Si, when Grandma said, "Mingming, come and eat." I touched my stomach and realized I was really hungry. I wanted to serve myself rice with a small spoon. But Grandma insisted on feeding me. I said, "Mingming can use a spoon himself." Grandma said I would spill it all over the table if I ate by myself. I was so angry I didn't want to eat anymore. I thought: Why does Mom let me use a spoon myself, but Grandma won't let me?
    Little Fatty Si came to find me to play. What should we play? Oh, I remember, Mom told me to often bathe and change clothes so I wouldn't get sick, let's give the doll a bath. We took off the doll's clothes, put it in the basin, and washed it and washed it. We washed it clean and dried it with a towel. "Okay, it's washed so white, the doll is so obedient. Hurry and put on your clothes, don't catch a cold." Little Fatty Si laughed, and I laughed too. Suddenly, Grandma came over and said, "Look at you two little rascals, you've gotten all the clothes wet, get out of here!" We were stunned.
    Today is Sunday, and Mom doesn't have to work. When I got up in the morning, I wanted to put on my own clothes, shoes, and tie my shoelaces. Mom is so good, she agreed to let me dress myself. But Grandma usually won't let me, saying I'm too young and can't do things, and that it takes too long to dress myself. Mom helped me put on my sleeves, and I buttoned the buttons myself. It was time to put on my shoes, but the shoelace just wouldn't go into the little hole. I threaded it and threaded it, and kept trying. Finally, I got it on, and Mom helped me tie the shoelaces. Mom was happy, and I was happy too. I said to Grandma, "Mingming can dress himself, Mingming is a big boy now!" Grandma smiled and said, "It takes you half a day to dress yourself, you'll catch a cold, Grandma will dress you tomorrow!" I pouted my little mouth, and thought: Why?

    明明的日记
    一觉醒来，睁开眼睛看见窗外多么亮的太阳呀，还有两只小鸟儿在树枝上叫着。
    我忽然想起，为什么还没有看见奶奶。连忙喊：“奶奶，奶奶”。奶奶跑来了。妈妈刚要去上班。奶奶说：“明明四岁了，今天过生日，买点糖果回来吧！”妈妈答应着，还说要给我买画书。我高兴得从被窝里跳起来喊着：“我爱看画书！”。
    晚上，奶奶给我洗脸。脸被风吹了，洗起来很痛，我哭着说：“明明不洗脸，明明不洗脸”。奶奶吓唬我说：“不洗脸等你睡觉了，大熊来舔你的脸，大熊有大红舌头，上面还有刺儿呢！”我吓坏了。赶忙哭着说：“大熊不舔明明脸，大熊舔奶奶的脸”。妈妈走来说：“好孩子都要洗脸，不洗脸，多脏！”说着把我拉过来轻轻的洗了。钻到被窝里，我想大熊不会舔我的脸了。
    我向奶奶要了一只红色铅笔，想画一条大金鱼。可是，奶奶没有给我纸，怎么办呢？我忽然想画在墙上多好，就拿起笔来，画了一条大金鱼，连忙跑去叫奶奶来看。奶奶一看，生气了，没有夸我画得好，还说：“看你到处乱画，多淘气！”她拿起手巾把金鱼擦掉了。我急得哭起来，奶奶对我一瞪眼，还要打我。
    晚上，我告诉妈妈。妈妈说：“我给明明订一个画本罢”。说着就找出一叠纸，裁好，订了一个画本。我高兴极了。
    我正和邻家的小胖四看画书，奶奶说：“明明来吃饭罢”。我一摸肚子，真的饿了。我想自己用小匙来盛饭吃。可是奶奶偏要喂我吃。我说：“明明自己会用匙子”。奶奶说我自己吃会洒一桌子。我气得不想吃饭了。我想：为什么妈妈让我自己用匙子吃，奶奶就不肯呢？
    小胖四来找我玩。我们干什么玩呢？哦，想起来了，妈妈告诉我要常常洗澡、换衣服，才不会生病，我们来给娃娃洗澡罢。我们把娃娃的衣服脱掉，放在盆里，洗呀洗。洗干净了，用毛巾擦干。“好了，洗得多白，娃娃真听话。快穿衣服罢，别着凉”。小胖四笑了，我也笑了。忽然，奶奶走来了，说：“看这两个小淘气鬼，把衣服全弄湿了，滚开！”我们呆住了。
    今天是星期日，妈妈不上班。早晨起床，我要自己穿衣服，穿鞋和系鞋带。妈妈真好，她答应我自己穿。可平常奶奶就不肯，说我还太小，不会做事，自己穿衣服，费时间。妈妈帮我把衣服袖子伸上了，我自己扣上了扣子。该穿鞋了，可是偏偏鞋带穿不到小孔里去，我穿呀穿呀，穿不上再穿。最后，穿上了，妈妈帮我把鞋带系好。妈妈高兴，我也高兴。我向奶奶说：“明明自己会穿衣服了，明明是大孩子了！”奶奶一边笑，一边说：“自己穿衣服穿半天，会凉着的，明天还是奶奶给你穿”！我把小嘴一噘，心里想：为什么。
