    Clearing the Way, Advancing Bravely
    After Reading "A Great Debate on the Literary and Art Front"
    Shao Quanlin
    Our revolutionary literary and art movement has been going on for nearly forty years, starting from the "May Fourth" Movement. In 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" further laid the theoretical foundation for our socialist literature and art. Since then, this literary movement has more clearly and consciously embarked on the road of serving socialism. Looking back at the path we have traversed in the past thirty years, there are extremely rich experiences of struggle. How to specifically analyze and summarize the historical experiences of various periods in the past according to the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's speech should be an important task in the construction of literary theory. In the past, we have done very little work in this regard. One of the reasons is that some important specific issues in the struggle between the two lines in the literary and art circles have not been debated in depth before, and therefore it is impossible to obtain a thorough solution. After the struggle to eliminate the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group in 1955, and after the anti-Rightist struggle in the literary and art circles last year, this condition matured. The anti-Rightist struggle in the literary and art circles last year was a socialist revolution on the literary and art front. The bourgeois elements who had been hiding in the revolutionary ranks for a long time could no longer get away with it. The great victory of this struggle not only severely defeated the Rightists' attack on the Party, but also clarified some major issues on the literary and art front for many years. In this regard, we should thank the Rightists, thank Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Chen Qixia and others. Their attacks helped us solve many problems. Their poisonous weeds have become fertilizer.
    Comrade Zhou Yang's recent article in the People's Daily, "A Great Debate on the Literary and Art Front," is a summary of this struggle. It not only summarizes the experience of the anti-Rightist struggle last year, but also lays the foundation for summarizing the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines in the Chinese literary and art circles for more than thirty years. This is of great significance to the current great leap forward in literary and art work. Because any new leap forward in work must be based on a summary of its past experiences.
    Here, I would like to talk about two issues regarding this article.
    First, it concerns the historical experience of the struggle between the bourgeois and proletarian lines on the Chinese literary and art front. The Chinese revolutionary literary and art movement began in the "May Fourth" Movement and developed under the leadership of the proletariat. After 1921, most of the people in the bourgeoisie split from this movement. The struggle between the two lines also began at this time. This struggle has a characteristic. That is to say: the social foundation of the Chinese bourgeoisie is very weak, so their writers are also very pitiful. They lack the ability of European and American bourgeois writers to set up a battle formation and fight us. They also tried it a bit. The earliest was Hu Shi's faction, then Chen Xiying's faction of "Modern Review," then the Crescent Moon School, and the Third Kind of People. They once openly raised the banner of anti-communism and anti-people, but after all, they could not form an array, and they were defeated after a few rounds. Therefore, Lu Xun said that the proletarian literary movement is the only literary movement in China, which is completely correct. But does this mean that the struggle between the two lines on the Chinese literary front is only manifested in the above-mentioned rounds? That is not the case. The Chinese bourgeois elements knew that openly raising the banner of anti-communism and anti-people would not work, so they changed their strategy, mixed into the left-wing literary and art ranks, and hung up the signboard of Marxism to sell bourgeois goods. This is called the strategy of "seizing from inside the fortress." The earliest one was the Trotskyist Wang Duqing, the ancestor of Wang Shiwei, Li Youran, etc., who was exposed after the "April 12th" incident. The Third Kind of People also initially mixed in the left-wing camp, but later their tails were revealed, and they couldn't stay any longer, so they had to set up their own stalls. Later, there was the Hu Feng faction, which was later proved to be a counter-revolutionary group, and Feng Xuefeng and Liu Xuewei supported this faction. In Yan'an, there were Wang Shiwei, Xiao Jun, Ding Ling and others, and Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng in the Kuomintang-controlled areas echoed each other. Because these people have always been hanging the banner of Marxism, they have confused many people and have a certain influence. After liberation, Chen Yong, Zhong Dianfei, Qin Zhaoyang and others were added. The literary and artistic thoughts of these people are inherited in the same line. The main manifestation is revisionism. Among them, Qin Zhaoyang's "Realism - A Broad Road" can be said to be the most systematic article reflecting this kind of thinking in the past two years. If we compile the remarks of these people, it is indeed a grand view. This is the concentrated expression of the bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts mixed in the revolutionary ranks. The struggle last year clarified these veins and basically defeated their inherited bourgeois ideological system.
    Some of our modern Chinese literary histories are generally written very well, but the description of the situation of the struggle between the two lines is still not clear enough. The ideological struggle in the left-wing camp is not clearly regarded as the struggle between the two lines. For example, the debate on the two slogans, the debate on national forms, etc., are often regarded as academic debates within the left wing, which is not clear. Before the anti-Hu Feng and anti-Rightist struggles, this situation was not surprising, but now we must expose the essence of those reactionary thoughts to make readers understand and not confuse the struggle between the two lines with academic debates.
    Comrade Zhou Yang's article clarified the context in this regard, which is of great help in writing literary history. This is one of the important gains in theoretical work. It is especially hoped that comrades who write literary history will study it. Literary history should be a summary of the creative practice and ideological struggle of a certain era. This article at least made a preliminary summary in terms of ideological struggle. Of course, these issues still need to be studied and analyzed in depth so that we can write a better modern literary history on this basis.
    This article not only straightened out the context, but also grasped its root. These bourgeois elements hanging the banner of Marxism have a variety of postures. However, their common old root is one, that is, bourgeois individualism; reflected in literary theory, it is mainly revisionism. Comrade Zhou Yang's article explained this very thoroughly. Individualists regard literary undertakings as personal, so they are bound to be incompatible with the direction of serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and with the leadership of the Party. Therefore, they tried their best to revise the principles of Marxist-Leninist literature. Individualistic thoughts are also manifested in various forms. For example, Ding Ling's "One Book Doctrine," Chen Qixia, Xiao Jun and others' crazy revengeism, and Feng Xuefeng's individual anarchism, but the root is all the individualistic worldview. Among them, Feng Xuefeng's individualism is even more profound. The thoughts reflected in the collections of "Rural Customs and Urban Customs" and "Advancing Without Retreating" can be said to be a thoroughgoing idealism. One of the most important characteristics of these individualistic thoughts is that they look down on the masses of the people. They are very big individuals, the masses of the people are very small, and the Party is also very small. Gorky said that he opposed dividing the people into "heroes" and "rabble." And those individualists regard themselves as "heroes," regard the common people as "rabble," and regard revolutionary cadres as "party hacks" and "mediocre people." Only they are the most amazing. We talk about "popularization," they talk about "transforming the masses," that is, to use their thoughts to "transform the people." Hu Feng talked about what "spiritual slavery trauma," Feng Xuefeng is actually the same. Therefore, when the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" put forward the task of literature and art serving the masses and writers learning from the masses and transforming themselves, they were shocked. They said: Intellectuals are intellectuals, what needs to be transformed? Not only in theory, but also in creation, Ding Ling's "Diary of Miss Sophie," "In the Hospital," "When I Was in Xia Village," and "Thoughts on March 8th" all reflect this emotion of looking down on and even hating the working people and cadres, which is basically the same as some of Lu Ling's novels in spirit. What they affirm are figures like Sophie, Lu Ping, and Zhenzhen, who are actually themselves. For the people or for the individual, collective first or individual first, this is the basic difference in our position and attitude from them, and it is also the basic difference between the bourgeois individualistic worldview and the communist worldview. It is precisely on the basis of this "I am the only one who is right" that they want to oppose the Party, oppose the people, engage in anti-Party groups, and engage in small circles. From Hu Feng, Wang Shiwei to Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, Feng Xuefeng, Jiang Feng and even Tang Yin, Tang Dachen are no exception. Is this accidental? Capitalists want to monopolize the market, and these individual careerists also want to monopolize the literary field. The basic principle is the same.
    They talk about individualism, with beautiful pretenses, called "liberation of individuality." In their view, it seems that socialism and the Communist Party are all restricting individuality. So they want to come to "liberate." This is extremely absurd and extremely reactionary! The liberation of individuality was a slogan during the bourgeois revolution, but the bourgeoisie cannot realize this slogan. At the same time, the so-called liberation of individuality of the bourgeoisie is also different from what we understand as the liberation of individuality. We say that first there must be class liberation, then there is liberation of individuality; there must be liberation of productive forces, then there is the development of individual creativity; there must be the unified will of the working class collective, then there is personal peace of mind. The individual and the collective, individuality and class nature are inseparable, they are a unity of opposites. Individual interests must be subordinate to collective interests, and the development of individuality must be obtained from the basis of collectivism. This is the view of materialist dialecticians. Therefore, true liberation of individuality can only be realized in socialist and communist societies. For example, the high degree of creativity and initiative of the working people in the current great leap forward in production is not possible under the socialist system, under the leadership of the Party, and in the battle of collectivism? And the so-called "liberation of individuality" of Hu Feng, Feng Xuefeng, Ding Ling and others is just the opposite. Their so-called "liberation of individuality" is incompatible with collectivism, it is the Sophie-style liberation of individuality, it is individual anarchism. This is actually not liberation of individuality, but the destruction of individuality. Gorky wrote a "The Destruction of Individuality" very thoroughly, you can take a look. In short, we talk about collectivism, they talk about individualism, one is materialism, the other is idealism, this is the struggle of two worldviews. Comrade Zhou Yang's article dug out their common old root from many specific facts. With this line, the words and deeds of these people are connected from the ideological essence.
    This article points out a law of the struggle between the two lines on the literary and art front. That is to say, literature and art are the weathervane of the times. Fifteen years ago was a historical turning point, there was a great struggle; fifteen years later is another historical turning point, there is another great struggle. It is always unfolded when the class struggle at home and abroad is the most acute. If we look further ahead, it is the same. The struggle against the Third Kind of People also occurred between the ebb of the 1927 revolution and the Second Revolutionary Civil War. None of this is accidental. This also illustrates the relationship between political struggle and literary and artistic ideological struggle. It is very important to understand this law, because there will always be storms and struggles in the future.
    Clarifying the context, digging out the root, and finding the law can be said to be a preliminary summary of the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines in China's proletarian literary movement for more than thirty years that this article has drawn.
    Second, it is about the issue of revisionism. This article discusses three issues: one is the issue of the evaluation of socialist literature, the second is the issue of artistic authenticity, and the third is the issue of "freedom of creation." The final summary says: Our differences with the Rightists and revisionists in literary and artistic thoughts are "most prominent and most concentratedly manifested in the view of the relationship between literature and art and politics. Revisionists try to make literature and art separate from revolutionary politics. Dogmatists simply believe that as long as there is politics, there is art. They ignore the characteristics of artistic creation and the importance of skills. Their formula is politics is art, which is actually to eliminate art, which is of course wrong. The revisionists' formula is art is politics, which is to make politics subordinate to art, which is actually to make revolutionary politics subordinate to the counter-revolutionary politics hidden under the cloak of art." Dogmatists replace the part with the whole, and revisionists replace the whole with the part. We advocate that the two are a unity of opposites. This passage is very clear and concise. The most fundamental issue in the successive literary and artistic ideological struggles for more than thirty years is this.
    Art serves politics, which is an objective law. The bourgeoisie is like this, and the working class is also like this. But it is by no means as some revisionists say, so this issue does not need to be discussed. Marxists want to grasp this objective law and point out its specific content and artistic tasks according to the requirements of a certain historical era. In fact, the specific relationship between politics and art is constantly changing. Politics is changing, the content of art is also changing, so the method of creation is also developing and innovating accordingly. Therefore, in the socialist era, we want to promote socialist realism. The Rightists and revisionists regard this relationship as immutable. They think that the realism of the 18th and 19th centuries is enough, and there is no need to develop it anymore. In fact, they do not like our current politics, so they do not like our current art, and they do not want to develop theories suitable for modern art. They say that running poetry magazines in the 19th century is the reason. In this regard, they even oppose Belinsky. Belinsky said that the power of the new art lies in the fact that it is far away from the so-called "pure art models" of the past. "The interests of art itself have to give way to other interests that are more important to mankind. Art nobly serves these interests and becomes their mouthpiece. However, it does not stop being art because of this, but only acquires new characteristics. Taking away art's right to serve social interests is to degrade it, not to improve it..." (See "A Glimpse of Russian Literature in 1847") This scientifically explains the development relationship between politics and art, and explains that art has gained new characteristics precisely because it serves certain social interests. Then, in the era of socialist revolution, art must serve the interests of socialist revolution, and it will inevitably bring new characteristics to art, and require new methods in creation. This is a very clear principle. The creative method of socialist realism is nothing more than developed according to Lenin's principles and the experience of Soviet literary and artistic practice. It is a product of the times. The Rightists and revisionists refuse to admit it, they do not admit this dialectical development of the relationship between politics and art, so they always look backwards like Shen Gongbao. Their mistaken views on the evaluation of socialist literature come from here.
    The same is true for the issue of artistic authenticity. As Comrade Zhou Yang said, "They always regard politics and art as opposites or the same." Regardless of whether they are opposites or the same, the purpose is to deny the role of politics in art. Feng Xuefeng's statement is: "In the decisive process of this contradictory struggle (referring to the contradiction between politics and literature and art), it also contains the matter of literature and art determining politics, and from the final achievement of literature and art itself, it cannot but transform the principle of politics determining literature and art into the realization of literature and art determining politics, that is, specific works." ("Aside") Qin Zhaoyang's statement is, "The ideology and tendency of realist literature exist in the flesh and blood of its authenticity and artistry" ("Realism - A Broad Road"); the meaning of the two statements is the same, that is, art is politics, or art determines politics, which is called "replacing the whole with the part." We say that politics is the soul and the commander, they say that art is the soul and the commander. This is the basic difference between us and them. On this issue, they distorted Belinsky again. Belinsky said, "The tendency itself must not only exist in the mind, but mainly must exist in the heart, in the blood of the writer," but when it comes to Qin Zhaoyang, it becomes, "The tendency ideology exists in the artistry and authenticity flesh and blood of it (art)"; Belinsky said, "Art must first be art, and then it can be the expression of social spirit and tendency in a specific period." The meaning is very clear: the former is the means, the latter is the purpose, then the means must be subordinate to the purpose, that is, art must be subordinate to politics. However, Feng Xuefeng reversed it, saying that it is mainly art that determines the contradiction between politics and art. Belinsky especially emphasized that literature must reflect new social movements. He said, "In this regard, the role played by literature is more than this; literature promotes the prosperity and growth of this tendency in society, not only reflects it in works; it transcends it, not only follows it." (See "A Glimpse of Russian Literature in 1847") The revisionists always ridicule literature for cooperating with the current political tasks. On this occasion, they once again put politics and art in opposition. The reason why I quote these words of Belinsky is because these people often emphasize the realism of the 19th century, and in fact even the realism theory of the 19th century has been distorted by them.
    While pointing out the errors of revisionism, Comrade Zhou Yang also pointed out the errors of dogmatism. He pointed out that the correct relationship should be "regarding politics and art as a unity of opposites; 'regarding the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form' as the goal of creation, and measuring all works with the unity of political standards and artistic standards with political standards as the first is correct." This is a very complete and clear statement.
    The issue of freedom of creation is essentially the issue of the relationship between Party spirit and individuality, collective and individual. The Party spirit and individuality of the proletariat are unified, so we require to achieve both unity of will and personal peace of mind. This is true freedom. The Rightists and revisionists regard Party spirit and individuality as absolutely opposed. The freedom of creation they demand is actually the anarchism of the old master style that Lenin opposed. It is freedom against the Party and against the people. In their view, our politics hinders their freedom of creation, so in order to "strive for" their "freedom of creation," they do not hesitate to oppose socialism and oppose the Party. This also still comes from their wrong views on politics and art.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The position of the Party's literary and artistic work in the Party's entire revolutionary work has been determined and arranged; it is subordinate to the revolutionary tasks stipulated by the Party in a certain revolutionary period. Opposing this arrangement will inevitably lead to dualism or pluralism, and its essence is like Trotsky's: 'Politics - Marxist; art - bourgeois.'" The revisionists oppose this arrangement, so they have to revise this main principle.
    The issue of the relationship between politics and art has been debated for decades, and it is necessary for theoretical critics to conduct further research and elaboration based on Lenin's principles and the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." However, theoretical research must be combined with practice, and must be good at summarizing the experience of creative practice and ideological struggle. Comrade Zhou Yang's article is a good example.
    The article concludes by pointing out that "If literature and art are to achieve a new leap forward, they must combine with the workers and peasants on a larger scale and to a greater depth, and literary and artistic works must be able to meet the needs of the masses in both quantity and quality." This is another decisive key to promoting the current great leap forward in literature and art. It can also be said to be the most important experience gained from the struggle last year. The victory of the anti-Rightist struggle last year and the subsequent long-term presence of a large number of writers and artists in the countryside and factories have opened up a broad road for the great leap forward in literary and artistic work today. For the sake of the great leap forward, in order to strive for a great harvest of socialist literature, we must deeply accept the experience of historical struggle in the literary and artistic circles and adhere to the direction of socialist literature and art.

    扫清道路，奋勇前进
    “文艺战线上的一场大辩论”读后
    邵荃麟
    我国革命文艺运动，从“五四”算起，将近四十年了。1942年毛泽东同志发表了“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”进一步奠定了我国社会主义文学艺术的理论基础，从此以后，这个文艺运动更明确地自觉地走上为社会主义服务的道路。回顾一下三十多年来我们所走过的道路，这中间是有极其丰富的斗争经验。如何根据毛泽东同志这个讲话的精神，具体地去分析和总结过去各个时期的历史经验，应该是文艺理论建设上一项重要工作。这个工作，过去我们做得很少。原因之一，就是文艺界两条道路斗争中的某些重要具体问题，在以前还没有深入地展开辩论，因而也不可能获得彻底解决。经过1955年肃清胡风反革命集团的斗争，再经过去年文艺界的反右派斗争，这个条件就成熟了。去年文艺界的反右派斗争，是文艺战线上一次社会主义的革命。长期隐藏在革命队伍中的资产阶级分子，再也不能混过关了。这场斗争的巨大胜利，不但狠狠地打垮了右派分子的向党进攻，并且也澄清了多年以来文艺战线上一些重大问题。在这点上，我们倒应该谢谢右派，谢谢丁玲、冯雪峰、陈企霞等人。由于他们的进攻，却帮助我们解决了不少问题。他们的毒草，变成了肥料。
    周扬同志最近在人民日报上发表的“文艺战线上的一场大辩论”就是这场斗争的一个总结。它不但总结了去年反右派斗争的经验，并且也为三十多年来我国文艺界两条道路的斗争的历史经验，作出了总结的基础。这对于目前文学艺术工作的大跃进是具有重要意义的。因为任何工作新的跃进，总必须根据于它过去的经验的总结。
    我这里，只想就这篇文章，谈两个问题。
    第一，是关于我国文艺战线上，资产阶级与无产阶级两条道路斗争的历史经验问题。中国的革命文艺运动，从“五四”开始，就是在无产阶级领导之下发展的。1921年以后，资产阶级中间的大部分人，从这个运动中分裂出去了。两条道路的斗争也就从这个时候开始。这个斗争有它一个特点。就是说：中国资产阶级的社会基础很薄弱，所以，他们的文学家也很可怜。他们缺少欧美资产阶级文学家的本领，能够摆开阵势，来和我们作战。他们也干过一下。最早有胡适的一派，后来有“现代评论”陈西滢的一派，再后有新月派，有第三种人。他们曾经公开打起反共、反人民的旗帜，可是终究布不成阵，几个回合便溃不成军了。所以鲁迅说：无产阶级文学运动是中国唯一的文学运动，这是完全正确的。但这是不是说，中国文学战线上的两条道路斗争，只表现在上述几个回合呢？那又不然。中国资产阶级分子知道公开打起反共反人民旗帜，是吃不开的，于是就改变战略，混到左翼文艺队伍中来，挂起马克思主义的招牌，来贩卖资产阶级的货色。这叫做“从堡垒内部来夺取”的战略。最早一个，是托派分子王独清，就是王实味、李又然等人的老祖宗，“四、一二”以后即被揭发出来了。第三种人最初也是混在左翼阵线里的，后来尾巴露了出来，混不下去了，就只好另摆摊子。再后来就有胡风这一派，以后证明是个反革命集团，冯雪峰、刘雪苇则是支持这一派的。在延安有王实味、萧军、丁玲等这一派，和国统区的胡风、冯雪峰等又是互相呼应的。这些人因为一直挂着马克思主义的招牌，所以就迷惑了不少群众，有一定的势力。到了解放后，又加上陈涌、锺惦棐、秦兆阳等人，这些人文艺思想是一派相承的，主要的表现就是修正主义。其中如秦兆阳的“现实主义——广阔的道路”可以说是这两年来最有体系的反映这种思想的一篇文章。我们如果把这些人的言论都编出来，那确是洋洋大观。这就是混在革命队伍中的资产阶级文艺思想的集中表现。去年这一场斗争，把这些脉络都弄清楚了，把他们这种一脉相承的资产阶级思想体系，基本上都打垮了。
    我们现在的一些现代中国文学史，大体上都写得很好，但是对两条道路斗争的情势的描写，还是不够清楚。没有明确地把左翼阵营中的思想斗争，看作是两条道路的斗争，例如关于两个口号的论争，关于民族形式的论争等等，往往看作是左翼内部的学术论争，这就不清楚了。在反胡风和反右派斗争以前，这种情况是难怪的，但是现在必须把那些反动思想的本质揭露出来，使读者明白，而不至于把两条道路的斗争和学术论争混淆起来。
    周扬同志的文章在这方面把脉络弄清楚了，对写文学史有很大帮助。这是理论工作上的重要收获之一。特别希望写文学史的同志研究一下。文学史应该是一定时代的创作实践和思想斗争的经验的总结。这篇文章至少在思想斗争方面做出了一个初步总结。自然，这些问题还需要作深入的研究分析，使我们能够在这个基础上写出较好的现代文学史来。
    这篇文章不但理清了脉络，还抓出了它的根子。这些挂着马克思主义招牌的资产阶级分子，他们表现的姿态是五花八门的。但是，他们共同的老根子则是一个，就是资产阶级的个人主义；反映在文艺理论上，主要是修正主义。周扬同志的文章把这一点说得很透彻。个人主义者是把文学事业看作是个人的，所以必然和为工农兵服务的方向，和党的领导相排斥。因此他们就竭力想修正马克思列宁主义文学的原则。个人主义思想，也表现为各种形态。例如丁玲的“一本书主义”，陈企霞、萧军等的疯狂报复主义，冯雪峰的个人无政府主义，但根子都是个人主义的世界观。在他们中间，冯雪峰的个人主义是更为深刻的。像反映在“乡风与市风”、“有进无退”这些文集里的思想，可以说是一种彻头彻尾的唯心主义。这些个人主义思想的一个最主要特征，就是看不起人民群众。他们个人很大，人民群众很小，党也很小。高尔基说过，他反对把人民分成为“英雄”和“群氓”。而那些个人主义者就是把自己看作“英雄”，把老百姓看作“群氓”，把革命干部看作是“党棍子”，是“庸人”。只有他们自己最了不起。我们讲“大众化”，他们讲“化大众”，就是要用他们的思想去“改造人民”。胡风讲什么“精神奴役创伤”，冯雪峰实际上也是一样，所以当“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”提出文艺要为群众服务，作家要向群众学习，改造自己的任务以后，他们就哗然起来。他们说：知识分子就是知识分子，要改造什么呢？不但理论上如此，创作上也如此，丁玲的“莎菲女士的日记”、“在医院中”、“我在霞村的时候”、“三八节有感”，都同样反映出这种看不起以至仇视劳动人民和干部的情绪，这和路翎的一些小说，基本精神是一致的。他们所肯定的就是莎菲、陆萍、贞贞这类人物，实际上就是他们自己。为人民还是为个人，集体第一还是个人第一，这就是我们和他们立场态度上的基本分歧，也是资产阶级个人主义世界观和共产主义世界观的基本分歧。正是在这种“唯我独尊”的思想基础上，所以他们要反党、反人民，搞反党集团，搞小圈圈。从胡风、王实味到丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰、江丰甚至到唐因、唐达成都毫无例外。这难道是偶然吗？资本家要垄断市场，他们这些个人野心家，也要垄断文场，这基本道理是一样的。
    他们讲个人主义，有漂亮的幌子，叫做“个性解放”。在他们看来，仿佛社会主义、共产党都是束缚个性的。于是他们要来“解放”。这真是荒谬之至，反动之至！个性解放是资产阶级革命时期的一个口号，可是资产阶级是不可能实现这个口号的。同时，资产阶级的所谓个性解放，和我们所理解的个性解放，意思也是不一样的。我们说，首先要有阶级解放，才有个性解放；要有生产力的解放，才有个人创造性的发扬；要有工人阶级集体的统一意志，才有个人的心情舒畅。个人与集体，个性与阶级性是分不开的，是对立的统一。个人利益必须服从集体利益，个性的发展必须从集体主义的基础上去获得。这就是唯物辩证主义者的看法。因此，真正的个性解放，只有在社会主义和共产主义社会中，才能实现。譬如目前生产大跃进中，劳动人民那样高度的创造性和积极性，不就是在社会主义制度之下，在党的领导之下，在集体主义的战斗之中，才有可能吗？而胡风、冯雪峰、丁玲等那些人的所谓“个性解放”恰恰是相反的。他们所谓“个性解放”是和集体主义相排斥的，是莎菲女士式的个性解放，是个人的无政府主义。这实际上不是什么个性解放，而是个性的毁灭。高尔基写过一篇“个性的毁灭”说得很透彻，大家可以看一看。总之，我们是讲集体主义的，他们是讲个人主义的，一个是唯物主义，一个是唯心主义，这就是两种世界观的斗争，周扬同志这篇文章从许多具体事实上挖出了他们这个共同的老根子。有了这一条线，就把这些人的言行从思想本质上贯串起来了。
    这篇文章指出了文艺战线上两条道路斗争的一条规律。这就是说，文艺是时代的风雨表。十五年前是个历史转折点，有一场大斗争；十五年后又是个历史转折点，又有一场大斗争，它总是在国际国内阶级斗争最尖锐的时候展开的。我们再往前看，也是一样，对第三种人的斗争，也是发生在1927年革命退潮到第二次国内革命战争之间。这都不是偶然的。这也说明了政治斗争与文艺思想斗争的关系。懂得这条规律很重要，因为以后总还会有风浪，有斗争。
    理清脉络，挖出根子，找到规律，可以说就是这篇文章对三十多年来我国无产阶级文学运动两条道路斗争的历史经验所得出的一个初步总结。
    第二，是关于修正主义的问题。这篇文章中谈了三个问题：一是对社会主义文学的估价问题，二是艺术真实性问题，三是“创作自由”问题。最后总结说：我们同右派分子和修正主义者在文艺思想上的分歧，“最突出、最集中地表现在对文艺和政治的关系的看法上。修正主义者力图使文艺脱离革命的政治。教条主义者简单地认为只要有政治，就有艺术。他们忽视艺术创作的特点和技巧的重要。他们的公式是政治即艺术，实际就是取消艺术，这当然是错误的。修正主义者的公式则是艺术即政治，这是使政治服从艺术，实际就是使革命的政治服从于掩盖在艺术外衣之下的反革命的政治。”教条主义者是以全体代替部分，修正主义者是以部分代替全体。我们主张两者是对立的统一。这段话，说得非常清楚扼要。三十多年来，历次文艺思想斗争中最根本的问题就是这个。
    艺术服务于政治，是一个客观规律。资产阶级如此，工人阶级也如此。但决不如像某些修正主义者所说，因此这个问题就无需讨论了。马克思主义者是要掌握这个客观规律，根据一定历史时代的要求，去指出它的具体内容和艺术的任务。事实上，政治与艺术的具体关系是不断在变化的。政治在变，艺术内容也在变，因此创作方法也随着在发展和革新。所以在社会主义时代，我们要提倡社会主义现实主义。右派分子和修正主义者则把这种关系看作一成不变。他们认为有了十八、十九世纪的现实主义就够了，再不要发展了。实际上就是他们不喜欢我们现在的政治，所以也不喜欢我们现在的艺术，也不要发展适应于现代艺术的理论。他们说办十九世纪的诗刊，就是这个道理。在这点上，他们连别林斯基也是反对的。别林斯基说过，新艺术的力量所在，就是它远远离开了过去的所谓“纯艺术的典范”。“艺术利益本身，不得不让位于对人类更重要的别的利益。艺术高贵地为这些利益服务，做它们的喉舌。可是，它毫不因此而中止其为艺术，而只是获得了新的特质。夺去艺术为社会利益服务的权利，这是贬抑它，却不是提高它……”（见“1847年俄国文学一瞥”）这是科学地说明了政治与艺术的发展关系、说明了艺术正由于它服务于一定的社会利益，才获得新的特质。那末，到了社会主义革命时代，艺术要为社会主义革命的利益服务，也就必然将给艺术带来了更新的特质，在创作上要求有新的方法，这是很明白的道理。1905年列宁所写的“党的组织和党的文学”就是给文学艺术提出了新的任务和新的原则。列宁肯定地指出文学必须成为无产阶级革命机器的齿轮和螺丝钉，这就把我们这个时代政治与艺术的关系，说得更明确了。社会主义现实主义的创作方法，也无非是根据列宁的原则和苏联文艺实践的经验而发展出来的。它是时代的产物。右派分子和修正主义者就是不肯承认它，他们不承认政治与艺术关系这种辩证的发展，因此他们像申公豹一样永远朝后看。他们对社会主义文学估价问题的错误看法，就是从这里来的。
    对于艺术真实性问题，也是一样。正如周扬同志所说，“他们总是把政治和艺术看成对立的或者等同的”。不管对立也好，等同也好，其目的都是为了否定政治对于艺术的作用。冯雪峰的说法是：“在这矛盾斗争（按即指政治与文艺的矛盾）的决定过程中，也就包含着文艺决定政治的事，而且从文艺本身的最后达到上说，还不能不将政治决定文艺的原则变成为文艺决定政治的实现的东西，也就是具体作品了。”（“题外的话”）；秦兆阳的说法是，“现实主义文学的思想性和倾向性是生存于它的真实性和艺术性的血肉之中”（“现实主义——广阔的道路”）；两种说法的意思是一样的，就是艺术即政治，或者艺术决定政治，这就叫做“部分代替全体”。我们说，政治是灵魂，是统帅，他们说，艺术是灵魂，是统帅。这就是我们和他们的基本分歧。在这个问题上，他们又把别林斯基加以歪曲了。别林斯基说过，“倾向性本身必须不仅存在在头脑里，却主要是必须存在在心里，在写作人的血液里”，可是到了秦兆阳，却变成了，“倾向性思想性是生存于它（艺术）的艺术性和真实性血肉之中”了；别林斯基说，“艺术首先必须是艺术，然后才能够是社会精神和倾向在特定时期中的表现”。这意思很清楚：前者是手段，后者是目的，那末手段就必须服从目的，即是艺术必须服从政治。可是冯雪峰却把它颠倒了，说什么决定政治与艺术的矛盾的，主要是艺术。别林斯基特削强调文学必须反映新的社会运动，他说“在这一点上，文学所起的作用是还不止此的；文学促进这种倾向在社会中繁荣、滋长，而不仅在作品中反映它；超越在它之前，而不仅尾随在它之后。”（均见“1847年俄国文学一瞥”）而修正主义者则总是嘲笑文学配合当前政治任务。在这种场合上，他们又把政治和艺术对立起来了。我之所以引用别林斯基的这些话，就因为他们这些人，常常强调十九世纪的现实主义，而实际上连十九世纪的现实主义理论也被他们所歪曲了。
    周扬同志在指出修正主义的错误的同时，也指出了教条主义的错误，他指出正确的关系应该是“把政治和艺术看成对立的统一；‘把政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一’作为创作的奋斗目标，以政治标准和艺术标准的统一而以政治标准为第一来衡量一切作品，这才是正确的”。这是很完整的和明确的说法。
    关于创作自由问题，实质上就是党性与个性，集体与个人的关系问题。无产阶级的党性和个性是统一的，所以我们要求做到既有意志统一、又有个人心情舒畅。这才是真正的自由。右派分子和修正主义者，把党性和个性看作是绝对对立的，他们所要求的创作自由，实际上就是列宁所反对的老爷式的无政府主义，是反党反人民的自由。在他们看来，我们的政治是妨碍他们的创作自由的，所以为了“争取”他们的“创作自由”，就不惜反对社会主义、反对党。这也仍然是从他们对政治与艺术的错误观点上来的。
    毛泽东同志说：“党的文艺工作，在党的整个革命工作中的位置，是确定了的，摆好了的；是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。反对这种摆法，一定要走到二元论或多元论，而其实质就像托洛茨基那样：‘政治——马克思主义的；艺术——资产阶级的’。”修正主义者就是反对这种摆法，所以他们就要修正这一条主要原则。
    政治与艺术的关系问题，曾经争论了几十年，需要理论批评家根据列宁的原则和毛泽东同志的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的精神，作进一步的研究和阐明。但是理论研究，必须结合实际，必须善于总结创作实践和思想斗争的经验。周扬同志这篇文章，是个很好的范例。
    这篇文章最后指出，“文艺如果要达到一个新的跃进，就必须在更大规模和更深程度上和工农群众相结合，文艺作品要在量和质两方面都能满足群众的要求”。这又是推动目前文学艺术大跃进的一个决定性关键。也可以说是从去年那场斗争中所获得一个最重要的经验。去年反右派斗争的胜利和接着大批作家艺术家的长期下乡下厂，这两件事是替今天文艺工作大跃进打开了一条宽广的道路。为了大跃进，为了争取社会主义文学的大丰收，我们要深刻地去接受文艺界历史斗争的经验和坚持社会主义文艺的方向。
