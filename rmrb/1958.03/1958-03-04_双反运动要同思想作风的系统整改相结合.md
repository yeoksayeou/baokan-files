    The Double-Anti movement must combine with systematic rectification of ideological style
    Jing Yu
    In the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, the Tianjin Enamel Factory looked for political issues through economic problems and investigated ideology beyond production, achieving a great victory in political thought. A new atmosphere of saving every bit, mutual assistance, and democracy and freedom emerged. This thorough approach of grasping politics and grasping ideology was very successful.
    Waste and conservatism always have their ideological roots. People's thoughts dictate their actions. Therefore, tracing the roots and clarifying thoughts is a crucial key to completely eliminating waste and conservatism. The facts revealed by many enterprises prove that the existence of various wasteful phenomena, when examined from the leadership's perspective, is nothing more than the mischief of subjectivism, bureaucracy, sectarianism, and other maladies, as well as the bad habits of officialdom and extravagance. Where do these bad habits come from? Are they produced from the working class? Of course not. Tracing the roots, it is still the influence of bourgeois ideology. Examining it from the perspective of employees, there are also ideological problems. For example, some people falsely report achievements and fraudulently receive materials, while others do not cherish public property and remain indifferent to waste. Why do these phenomena occur? Tracing the roots, some are due to the old rules left over from capitalist enterprises that have not been eliminated, and some are also influenced by bourgeois ideology. Everyone thinks, if the leaders of socialist enterprises and the workers of socialist enterprises are infected with the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and retain the past habits of dealing with capitalists, is this not worthy of vigilance? Our enterprises are social, and our production is also social. We do not have the contradiction between the social nature of capitalist production and private ownership. Despite this, if the ideological consciousness of some people is not collectivist and cannot adapt to the new relations of production, how can production be improved?
    Comrade Mao Zedong said that politics is the lifeline of all economic work. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the focus must be on resolving political, ideological, and stylistic issues, and we must not fall into simple economic and technical matters. Economic and technical problems must also be resolved, but if people's ideological problems are not resolved, simply solving economic problems will have limited results. Currently, it is worth noting that some economic workers and enterprise managers still do not pay much attention to politics. They only see the role of things and not the role of people; they only see the effect of rules and regulations and not the effect of political and ideological work. They do not understand that the existence of serious waste in enterprises is an economic problem and also a political problem. They only know how to use economic methods to solve problems in enterprises and are not good at using political methods to solve economic problems. As a result, they are always in a passive and busy state and cannot extricate themselves.
    The experience of the Tianjin Enamel Factory is very good. It tells us that starting with exposing various wasteful and conservative phenomena, we must look for the political and ideological roots through the various phenomena in the economic field. In this way, we can see the essence of the problem, gain leadership, and create a new atmosphere between people.

    双反运动要同思想作风的系统整改相结合
    静宇
    天津搪瓷厂在反浪费、反保守运动中，透过经济找政治，跳出生产查思想，在政治思想上打了一个大胜仗。出现了点滴节约、团结互助、民主自由的新风气。这种寻根究底，抓政治、抓思想的做法，十分成功。
    浪费和保守，总是有它的思想根源的。人们的思想怎样，人们的行动也就怎样。所以追本穷源，澄清思想，是彻底反掉浪费和保守的重要关键。许多企业揭发的事实证明：各种浪费现象的存在，从领导方面来检查，无非是主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义等毛病和官风暮气、阔风娇气等歪风在作怪。这些歪风歪气从那里来的？难道是从工人阶级中产生的吗？当然不是。追根究底，还不是受了资产阶级思想的影响。从职工方面来检查，也是有思想问题的。譬如说，有些人虚报成绩、冒领材料，有些人不爱惜公共财物，看到浪费现象无动于衷。为什么出现这些现象呢？追根究底，有的是资产阶级企业遗留下来的陋规未除，有的也是受了资产阶级思想的影响。大家想想，社会主义企业的领导人员和社会主义企业的工人却沾染了资产阶级的腐朽思想，保留了过去对待资本家的习气，难道还不值得警惕吗？我们的企业是社会性的，我们的生产也是社会性的，我们没有资本主义的生产社会性和私人占有制的矛盾。尽管如此，如果某些人们的思想意识不是集体主义的，不能适应新的生产关系，这又怎能把生产搞好呢？
    毛泽东同志说过，政治是一切经济工作的生命线。在反浪费、反保守的运动中，必须以解决政治、思想、作风为重要内容，不能陷到单纯的经济、技术中去。经济、技术问题也是要解决的，但是，如果人们的思想问题没有解决，单纯去解决经济问题，收效也是有限的。当前，值得严重注意的是有些经济工作人员、企业管理人员还不大关心政治，他们只看到物的作用，看不到人的作用，只看到规章制度的效果，看不到政治思想工作的效果。不明白企业中严重浪费现象的存在是个经济问题，也是个政治问题，只懂得用管经济的方法去解决企业里的问题，不善于用政治的方法去解决经济问题，结果，他们就老是处于被动忙乱中，不能自拔。
    天津搪瓷厂的经验很好。它告诉我们：从揭发各种各样的浪费和保守现象入手，要透过经济方面的各种现象，去寻找政治思想根由。这样，才能看到问题的本质，才能取得领导权，才能出现人与人的新的风气。
