How should philosophy and social science achieve a great leap forward? I think the first thing to clarify is that its purpose is to serve the great leap forward in production. How can science serve the great leap forward in production? First and foremost, we must do a good job in this rectification campaign and strengthen the scientific ranks.

Currently, the development of philosophy and social science is relatively slow, but the strength is there. The problem lies in how to organize effectively and mobilize forces from all sides to move towards a common goal.

I hope that the philosophy and social science professional groups of the Science Planning Commission will seize the time, take responsibility, and work closely with the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences to organize the various research institutes, colleges, universities, and other relevant units. Separately convene symposiums to discuss how to implement the twenty articles of the philosophy and social science plan. Based on the results of everyone's discussions, draft various proposals, put forward outlines for research and writing, and designate some responsible persons to work collectively to complete the tasks within a certain period. At the same time, establish methods for division of labor, collaboration, and progress inspection. Only by doing this can we ensure that the twenty articles of the philosophy and social science plan can be realized.

Law is even more backward than other social sciences. The Institute of Law was originally scheduled to be established in 1956, but preparations have only just begun. Now, I offer some immature opinions:

1.  Research should be combined with teaching. Researchers at the Institute of Law should teach some courses at political and law colleges and departments, using the schools as experimental plots; teaching staff should also take time to serve concurrently as researchers at the Institute of Law to further improve their theory. At present, there are very few people in the legal profession, and this is the only way to solve the current difficulty of manpower shortage.

2.  Theory should be combined with practice. Researchers at the Institute of Law lack practical experience and should often go to political and legal organs to study in the field; responsible persons in political and legal organs also need to strengthen their theoretical cultivation and should take some time to engage in research work concurrently at the Institute of Law. This can solve the practical difficulties of both sides.

In addition, some universities used to run law departments and stored a lot of legal books and materials, which are now completely unused; some libraries also have a lot of legal books and materials piled up, which have not yet been sorted out. I sincerely hope that all relevant units will transfer those unneeded legal books and materials to the Institute of Law as much as possible. Doing so also embodies the spirit of "building the country with diligence and thrift."

    法学研究人员应搞试验田
    周新民
    哲学社会科学如何跃进？我认为首先要明确它的目的是为生产大跃进服务的。科学如何为生产大跃进服务？又首先要搞好这次整风，加强科学队伍。
    现在哲学社会科学的发展还比较慢，但是力量是有的，问题在于如何很好地进行组织，把各方面力量动员起来，朝着共同目标迈进。
    我希望科学规划委员会的哲学社会科学各专业小组抓紧时间，负起责任来，同哲学社会科学部密切合作，把各研究所、院、校和其他有关单位组织起来，分别召集座谈会，讨论哲学社会科学规划二十条如何执行问题。根据大家讨论的结果，拟订各个方案，提出研究和写作的提纲，并推定一些负责人集体来搞，限定在某一时期内完成任务。同时订出分工协作、检查进度等办法。这样做才可保证哲学社会科学规划二十条能够实现。
    法学较其他社会科学更加落后。法学研究所原定在1956年建立，到现在才开始筹备。现在，提点不成熟的意见：
    1、研究同教学要结合。法学研究所研究人员应该到政法院、系里教点课，把学校作个试验田；教学人员也应该抽出时间到法学研究所兼个研究员，进一步提高理论。目前法学界的人很少，只有这样做才能解决当前人力缺乏的困难。
    2、理论同实际要结合。法学研究所研究人员缺少实际经验，应该常到政法机关实地学习；政法机关负责人员有的也需要加强理论修养，应该抽出一定时间到法学研究所兼搞研究工作。这样做，可以解决双方的实际困难。
    此外，有些大学过去办过法律系，储存很多法学的图书资料，现已完全不用了；也有些图书馆堆积很多法学图书资料，至今还无人整理。我诚恳希望各有关单位把那些不需要的法学图书资料尽量拨给法学研究所。这样做，也体现了“勤俭建国”的精神。
