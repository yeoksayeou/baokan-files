    Missile City on the Beach
    Under the shadow of economic depression, the United States is currently a scene of desolation everywhere. However, according to a recent report in the British "The Times," a newly emerging small city "Cocoa Beach" on the Atlantic coast of Florida is showing a "prosperous" atmosphere.

    This small city, which Americans boast is in an era of "space age prosperity," is actually just the product of the Cape Canaveral base where the U.S. Air Force launches missiles and rockets. A few years ago, this was a desolate beach full of swamps and dotted with a few dilapidated houses of shrimp fishermen. Except for the occasional work teams of black prisoners coming to repair the roads, seabirds were the masters of this desolate beach. However, since 1954, when the U.S. government began to expand the Cape Canaveral base and busily test rockets here, this desolate beach has become increasingly prosperous. With the rapid increase in staff at the base, merchants from all walks of life followed, and "Cocoa Beach" near the base quickly developed into a city of nearly 10,000 people! In this small city, there are all kinds of hotels, apartments, restaurants, and bars with various signboards such as "Vanguard," "Heaven," "Ocean Missile," and "Starlight." At night, neon lights in the shape of various missiles and interstellar spaceships flicker with colorful lights. Some large companies that have made fortunes relying on rockets and missiles, such as Martin Company, Convair Company, and General Electric Company, have rented and purchased entire luxury apartments for the long term.

    As arms dealers' businesses are booming and the small city is rapidly prospering, land prices are also rising like rockets. Some merchants with "foresight" bought an acre of land for only a few dollars a few years ago, and now they can sell it for nearly a thousand dollars, and they don't have to worry about finding buyers. Although the deteriorating economic situation is spreading across the country like a plague, people here are boasting that the "prosperity" of "Cocoa Beach" will last forever.

    The "prosperity" brought to "Cocoa Beach" by missiles is a microcosm of the distorted social phenomenon of an economically militarized America. According to "U.S. News & World Report" on February 28, the U.S. government is preparing to allocate $3 billion to build ten missile bases in five years. The magazine boasted that these missile bases would "prosper" the local market, increase the sales of supplies, and expand the number of employees. However, "U.S. News & World Report" seems to have forgotten one point, that is: the "prosperity" built on the beach is unreliable, and it cannot conceal the truth of the severe depression in the United States today.

    海滩上的导弹城
    在经济萧条的阴云笼罩下，目前美国到处是一片惨淡的景象。但是，据最近英国“泰晤士报”的报道，在佛罗里达州大西洋岸边的一个新兴小城“寇寇海滩”，却呈现出“繁荣”的气象。
    这个被美国人自诩为处在“空间时代的繁荣”的小城，实际上，只不过是美国空军发射导弹和火箭的卡纳维拉尔角基地的产物。几年前，这里还是一片满布沼泽、只有少数捕虾渔民的破烂房子点缀着的荒凉海滩。除了偶尔有黑人囚犯的苦工队来修路外，海鸟就是这片荒滩的主人。但是，自从1954年，美国政府开始扩建卡纳维拉尔角基地，并在这里忙碌地试验火箭后，这个荒凉海滩就日益兴隆起来了。随着基地上的工作人员迅速增加，各行各业的商人接踵而来，基地附近的“寇寇海滩”便迅速发展成为近万人口的城市！在这个小城里，到处是一些冠着“先锋”、“天国”、“海洋导弹”、“星光”等五花八门招牌的旅店、公寓、饭馆、酒吧。入夜，各种导弹、星际飞船形状的霓虹灯闪烁着五颜六色的光芒。一些依靠火箭和导弹发财的大公司像马丁公司、康瓦尔公司及通用电气公司等，将整座豪华公寓长期租购一空。
    军火商人买卖兴隆，这座小城迅速地繁荣起来，于是地价也像火箭一样直线上升。一些有“远见”的商人，几年前只用数美元购买一英亩地，现在可以出售近千美元，并且不愁没有买主。尽管经济情况恶化像瘟疫一样在全国到处蔓延，但是这里的人却在夸耀说，“寇寇海滩”的“繁荣”将永远保持下去。
    导弹给“寇寇海滩”带来的“繁荣”，是经济军事化的美国畸形社会现象的一个缩影。据2月28日的“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，美国政府准备拨出三十亿美元在五年内建筑十个导弹基地。这家杂志吹嘘说，这些导弹基地将“繁荣”当地市面，增加供应品消售和扩大就业人数。不过，“美国新闻与世界报道”似乎忘记了一点，那就是：建立在沙滩上的“繁荣”是靠不住的，它也掩盖不住今日美国严重萧条的真相。　（龙）（附图片）
