Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 3rd: More than 50 scientific and technological workers in Tianjin held a meeting on the 2nd, deciding to respond to the proposal of 17 scientists in Shanghai and launch a socialist competition with the scientific and technological circles in Shanghai and the entire country. In terms of ideological and work leaps forward, they will carry out a "three comparisons" movement—comparing determination, comparing drive, and comparing advanced achievements—to set off a new upsurge of self-transformation and marching towards science.

The proposal passed at the meeting put forward five guarantees, requiring: devoting our hearts to the Party, determined to follow the Party; shedding the airs of intellectuals, going deep into production practice, integrating with workers and peasants, honestly learning from workers and peasants, and better serving workers and peasants; diligently studying politics and conscientiously transforming our thinking; adhering to the socialist direction of scientific work, rapidly improving the level of science and technology; actively cultivating reserve forces for science, helping worker and peasant cadres master science and technology, and popularizing scientific and technological knowledge among the worker and peasant masses.

Many scientists, professors, doctors, engineers, and others spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to strive to become intellectuals of the working class as soon as possible. Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University and physicist, proposed in his plan to actively study politics, strengthen physical exercise, and carefully study six classic works, including the History of the Chinese Revolution, Natural Dialectics, Materialism, and Critique of Experience, within five years; and to strive to spend a certain amount of time each year among the worker and peasant masses, learning from the workers and peasants.

Yang Shixian, President of Nankai University and chemist, proposed: In order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agriculture, to intensify the research work on pesticides, to cultivate a research base in the Chemistry Department of Nankai University, and to become a pesticide research center during the second five-year plan.

    天津科技界掀起三比运动同全国科技界展开竞赛
    据新华社天津3日电　天津科学技术工作者五十多人2日举行会议，决定响应上海十七位科学家的倡议，同上海和全国的科学技术界展开社会主义竞赛。在思想跃进和工作跃进方面，开展一个比决心、比干劲、比先进的三比运动，掀起一个自我改造和向科学进军的新高潮。
    会上通过的倡议书中提出五项保证，要求做到：把心交给党，决心跟着党走；放下知识分子架子，深入生产实际，和工农打成一片，老老实实地向工农学习，更好地为工农服务；努力学习政治，认真改造思想；坚持科学工作的社会主义方向，迅速提高科学技术水平；积极培养科学后备力量，帮助工农干部掌握科学技术，向工农群众普及科学技术知识等。
    许多科学家、教授、医师、工程师等在会上发言，他们一致表示决心争取早日成为工人阶级的知识分子。天津大学校长、物理学家张国藩在规划中提出积极学习政治，加强锻炼，五年内仔细学完中国革命史和自然辩证法、唯物论、经验批判论等六部经典著作；每年争取一定时间到工农群众中，向工农学习。
    南开大学校长、化学家杨石先提出：为了适应农业大跃进的需要，加紧进行农药的研究工作，在南大化学系培养一个研究基地，在第二个五年计划期间成为农药研究中心。
