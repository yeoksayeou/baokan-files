Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 27th: The U.S. Army launched a small artificial satellite, almost identical to the first U.S. satellite, into orbit at Cape Canaveral on March 26th at 17:38 GMT using a "Jupiter-C" four-stage rocket. According to U.S. experts, because the orbit after launch is very different from the pre-launch plan, this satellite will not exist for long and will soon fall and burn up.

    The U.S. Army had successfully launched a very small artificial satellite, dubbed "Explorer," nearly four months after the Soviet Union successfully launched an artificial satellite, using a "Jupiter-C" rocket. On March 5th, they prepared to launch another "Explorer" using a "Jupiter-C" rocket, but it fell into the sea before it could take off. However, the satellite launched this time is still called "Explorer III." This "Explorer III" is not very different from "Explorer I." It is shaped like a cannon shell, is also 80 inches long and 6 inches in diameter, weighs 31 pounds, only 0.2 pounds heavier than "Explorer I." In addition, the satellite does not fly very high. One of the main people in charge of the satellite's radiation, former German rocket expert Braun, said that the satellite's closest distance to the ground during operation is only 100 miles. Another person in charge, Major General John Medaris, estimates that the satellite will fall within two days to two weeks.

### 美国又发射一弹丸  分量轻  体积小  飞得低  掉得快

    美国又发射一弹丸
    分量轻  体积小  飞得低  掉得快
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国陆军26日国际标准时间十七点三十八分，在卡纳维拉尔角用“丘辟特—C式”四级火箭把一个跟美国第一个卫星差不多的小人造卫星送上了轨道。据美国专家说，由于发射后的轨道跟发射前的计划相差很远，这个卫星将存在不久就要掉下来烧焚。
    美国陆军曾在苏联发射人造卫星成功后差不多四个月用“丘辟特—C式”火箭发射成功一个很小人造卫星，号称“探险者”。3月5日他们又准备用“丘辟特—C式”火箭发射一个“探险者”，不料没有飞起就落到海里去了。但是，这次发射的卫星还被称为“探险者三号”。这个“探险者三号”同“探险者一号”没有很大不同，它呈炮弹形，也是长八十英寸，直径六英寸，重量是三十一磅，只比“探险者一号”重○点二磅。另外，就是卫星飞得不高。卫星放射主要负责人之一、前德国火箭专家布劳恩说这个卫星运行中离地面最近时只有一百英里。另一个负责人约翰·梅达里斯少将估计，这个卫星在两天到两个星期之间就要掉下来。
