Ministry of Culture Deepens the Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism Movement

    This newspaper reports: The Ministry of Culture's anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has entered a stage of thorough improvement. Vice Minister Qian Junrui, at a cadre meeting of more than eight thousand people the other day, called on everyone to further criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, thoroughly achieve victory in this movement, and take it as the guiding principle for promoting all work.
    In the past month or so of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the Ministry of Culture has made significant achievements in the process of simultaneous airing of views, debates, and rectification. Wasteful phenomena in its affiliated units have been greatly reduced, a trend of diligence and thrift is gradually forming, and everyone is highly motivated. The National Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, the Beijing Youth Art Theatre, the Beijing Map Publishing House, and many other units have seen a new atmosphere of fewer people, less money spent, and more work done and done better. The preliminary savings plans formulated by various departments and units can save approximately 30% of expenses for central units alone. The work style and methods of leadership at all levels have been significantly improved, and the relationships between the Party and the masses, leaders and those led, and comrades have become closer.
    In order to achieve a complete victory in the movement, Qian Junrui demanded at the meeting that all staff members must first further oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and resolutely implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." He said that the emergence of this kind of thinking is basically due to being divorced from the masses, failing to see the masses' urgent demands for culture, and failing to see the endless power of the vast number of cadres and the masses to carry out work and overcome difficulties. Right-leaning conservative thinking in the Ministry of Culture is serious. This is a serious obstacle to implementing the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." He asked everyone to focus on opposing right-leaning conservatism, launch a vigorous airing of views and debates, and further eliminate bureaucratic airs, lethargy, arrogance, and delicacy. On this basis, the Ministry should improve the five-year plan for cultural work and rearrange this year's business.
    Secondly, he demanded that, from the leadership of the Ministry to all units, they should further mobilize the masses for extensive debate, formulate plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and streamlining institutions. And rely on the efforts and supervision of the masses to ensure its implementation.
    In order to consolidate and promote the achievements already made in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, he requested that a new political situation of "both democracy and centralism, both freedom and discipline, both unified will and individual ease of mind and liveliness" be created within each unit. This new situation has already begun to appear in several units. To achieve this, leading comrades in each unit must participate in grassroots work, participate in production, engage in experimental plots, and closely integrate leaders with the masses; leading comrades must greatly promote democracy and truly interact with people as ordinary laborers, making people feel equal. Leaders and those led, as well as comrades, should treat each other with sincerity, give their hearts to others, and not "only say three-tenths of what's on their mind when meeting people"; political and ideological work should be strengthened, and regular inspections and comparisons should be carried out between units and within each unit, motivating everyone to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced, so as to catch up with the situation of the entire social great leap forward.

### 文化部反浪费反保守节节深入

    文化部反浪费反保守节节深入
    本报讯　文化部反浪费反保守运动进入彻底改进阶段。钱俊瑞副部长在前日八千多人的干部大会上，号召大家进一步批判右倾保守思想，彻底取得这一运动的胜利，并以它为推动一切工作的纲。
    文化部在前一个多月的反浪费反保守运动中，在边鸣放边辩论边整改的过程中，已做出了显著的成绩。它所属各单位的浪费现象大大减少，勤劳节俭的风气在逐渐形成，大家干劲很大。全国新闻电影制片厂、北京青年艺术剧院、北京地图出版社以及其它许多单位出现了人减少、钱少花、事情多做而且做得更好的新气象。各司局、各单位初步制定出的节约计划，仅中央所属单位就可节约经费30％左右。各级领导作风和工作方法有了显著的改进，党群关系、领导与被领导以及同志之间的关系也更加密切了。
    为了取得运动的彻底胜利，钱俊瑞在大会上要求全体工作人员，首先必须进一步反对右倾保守思想，坚决贯彻多快好省的方针。他说这种思想的产生基本上由于脱离群众，不看到群众对于文化的迫切要求，不看到广大干部和群众开展工作和克服困难的无穷无尽的力量。文化部的右倾保守思想是严重的。这是贯彻多快好省方针的严重障碍。他要求大家以反右倾保守为专题，轰轰烈烈的展开鸣放和辩论，进一步打掉官气、暮气、骄气和娇气。在这一基础上搞好文化工作五年规划和重新安排今年的业务。
    其次，他要求从部的领导到各单位要进一步发动群众大辩论，制定增产节约与整编机构的方案。并且依靠群众的努力和监督，保证它得到实现。
    为了巩固和发扬反浪费反保守运动已取得的成绩，他要求在各单位内造成“又有民主，又有集中，又有自由，又有纪律，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼”的新的政治局面。这种新的局面在若干单位已经开始出现。为了做到这点，各单位的领导同志必须参加基层工作，参加生产，搞试验田，领导与群众密切地结合；领导同志要大大发扬民主，真正以一个普通的劳动者的姿态与人接触，使人感到平等。领导与被领导以及同志之间，都要以诚待人，把心交给人，不要“逢人只说三分话”；要加强政治思想工作，单位与单位之间以及在每一单位内部，要定期进行检查、评比，发动大家学先进、赶先进，以赶上整个社会大跃进的形势。
