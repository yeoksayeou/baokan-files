Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 6th - The authorities of the United Arab Republic announced on the 5th the nation's provisional constitution, stipulating that the new republic is composed of two provinces, Egypt and Syria, with the capital in Cairo. The provisional constitution, totaling seventy-three articles, stipulates that the legislative power of the state is exercised by the National Assembly. The number of members of the National Assembly shall be determined by order of the President of the Republic, and at least half of the members of the Assembly must be former members of the Egyptian and Syrian parliaments. The National Assembly is located in Cairo, but may also be convened elsewhere at the request of the President. Members of parliament cannot concurrently hold government office. Members of parliament must be at least thirty years old.

The National Assembly is convened and adjourned by the President. The President may dissolve the parliament, in which case a new parliament shall be convened within sixty days. The President has the power to declare a state of emergency. Executive power rests with the President. The President may appoint and remove one or more vice presidents and ministers of various ministries.

Citizens of the Republic will form a National Union, the purpose of which is to achieve the goals of the state and to build the state on a sound political, social, and economic foundation.

The provisional constitution stipulates that an executive committee shall be established in each of the two regions of Egypt and Syria, appointed by the President. The committees will be responsible for implementing overall policies in their respective provinces. Regional administrative heads are independent within the limits prescribed by law. All laws currently in force in the two regions of Egypt and Syria shall continue to be valid, but these laws may be repealed or amended in accordance with the provisions of the present constitution.

The implementation of this constitution shall not alter the international treaties and agreements concluded by Syria and Egypt with foreign countries prior to the establishment of the United Arab Republic. These treaties and agreements shall continue to be effective in their current form within the geographical scope stipulated at the time of conclusion, in accordance with the principles of international law.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 5th - United Arab Republic President Nasser delivered a lengthy speech to a large crowd gathered in front of the guest house here on the afternoon of the 5th.

He said: The provisional constitution is "the first constitution marking Arab unity and the first fruit of the long-term struggle of the Arab people for Arab unity."

He pointed out that those who oppose this unity and oppose the policy of freedom and independence will never be reconciled. He said that imperialism still exists, and therefore the struggle for freedom and independence is a long-term one.

He then exposed a new conspiracy targeting the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic. He said that someone had given 1.9 million pounds to a senior Syrian military officer to plot a coup. But the conspiracy failed because the recipient reported everything to Marshal Amir, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic.

Nasser said that the first installment of one million pounds of the aforementioned funds was paid on February 20, 1958, by a check from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, and that the money received has been deposited in the Arab Bank in Damascus under the name "A·S". Nasser pointed out: "Of course, A·S is Abdul Hamid Sarraj. They knew he was the one who discovered their conspiracy, so they hoped to take a shortcut and achieve the coup through him." Sarraj is the head of the Second Bureau of the Syrian Army in charge of intelligence.

Sarraj held a press conference on the evening of the 5th, detailing the conspiracy. He said that the conspiracy was carried out through Assad Ibrahim, the father-in-law of King Saud.

    阿联当局公布临时宪法
    纳赛尔揭露外国颠覆新阴谋
    新华社大马士革6日电　阿拉伯联合共和国当局5日公布了国家的临时宪法，规定这个新共和国由埃及和叙利亚两个省组成，首都在开罗。总共七十三条的临时宪法规定，国家的立法权由国民议会行使，国民议会的议员人数由共和国总统的命令决定，议会议员至少有半数必须是原埃及和叙利亚议会议员。国民议会设在开罗，但是在总统的要求下也可以在其它地方召开。议员不能同时兼任政府官员。议员的年龄不得小于三十岁。
    国民议会由总统召集和宣布闭会。总统可以解散议会，在这种情况下，新议会应在六十天内召集。总统有权宣布国家处于紧急状态。行政权力在于总统。总统得任免一个或若干副总统和各部部长。
    共和国公民将组成民族联盟，这个联盟的目的是实现国家的目标和把国家建立在健全的政治、社会和经济基础上。
    临时宪法规定，在埃及和叙利亚两个地区各设立一个执行委员会，由总统任命。委员会将负责在本省贯彻总的政策。地区行政长官在法律规定的范围内是独立的。目前在埃及和叙利亚两地区实行的一切法律将继续有效，但是这些法律可以根据现行宪法的规定加以废除或修改。
    这个宪法的实施将不改变叙利亚和埃及在阿拉伯联合共和国成立之前同外国缔结的国际条约和协定，这些条约和协定将根据国际法原则在缔约当时规定的地区范围内以其目前的形式继续生效。
    据新华社大马士革5日电阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔5日下午对聚集在这里迎宾馆前面的大批群众发表了长篇演说。
    他说：临时宪法是“标志着阿拉伯团结的第一个宪法，是阿拉伯人为了阿拉伯团结进行的长期斗争的第一个成果。”
    他指出，那些反对这种团结、反对自由独立的政策的人们绝不会甘心。他说，帝国主义仍然存在，因此为实现自由和独立而进行的斗争是长期的。
    他接着揭露了针对阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区的新阴谋。他说，曾经有人拿了一百九十万英镑给一个叙利亚高级军官，要他密谋政变。但是这个阴谋失败了，因为接受款子的人把一切情况报告了阿拉伯联合共和国武装部队总司令阿密尔元帅。
    纳赛尔说，上述款项中的第一笔一百万英镑是在1958年2月20日以来自沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得的支票支付的，已经收到的这笔款子是在大马士革的阿拉伯银行里存在“A·S”名下的。纳赛尔指出：“当然，A ·S就是阿卜杜勒·哈米德·萨拉杰。他们知道他是发现了他们的阴谋的一个人，因此他们希望走捷径，通过他来实现政变。”萨拉杰是叙利亚陆军管理情报的第二处处长。
    萨拉杰在5日晚上举行记者招待会，详细地揭发了这个阴谋。他说，这个阴谋是通过国王沙特的岳父阿萨德·易卜拉欣进行的。
