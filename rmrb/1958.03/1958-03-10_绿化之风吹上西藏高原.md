    The Wind of Greening Sweeps Across the Tibetan Plateau
    (Our dispatch) Lhasa — In the past few days, more than two thousand Tibetan and Han cadres and students in Lhasa have planted 140,000 saplings in the wilderness on the outskirts of Lhasa.
    These days, people brave the cold morning wind on the plateau to participate in labor before dawn. On the barren land full of rocks, they dug planting ditches more than 14,000 meters long, 60 cm deep and 40 cm wide, and also excavated and repaired nearly 3,000 meters of water delivery channels.
    On a 40,000 square meter piece of land in the western suburbs of the city, hundreds of thousands of saplings have grown after planting in the past three years. After these trees grow, Lhasa will have some new "linka" (parks) and be able to block some of the wind and sand. In Shigatse, Qamdo and other places, tree planting activities have also begun successively.

    绿化之风吹上西藏高原
    本报讯　拉萨市两千多名藏、汉族干部和学生，最近几天已在拉萨市郊的荒野里种植了十四万棵树苗。
    这几天，天不亮人们就冒着高原上寒冷的晨风到郊外参加劳动。他们在乱石累累的荒地上，挖成了共长一万四千多公尺的深六十公分、宽四十公分的植树沟，还挖掘和修补了近三千公尺长的送水渠道。
    在城市西郊一块四万平方公尺的土地上，经过最近三年来的种植，已生长着数十万棵树苗。这些树木长成后，拉萨将会增加一些新的林卡并能挡住部分风沙。日喀则、昌都等地，也先后开始了植树活动。
