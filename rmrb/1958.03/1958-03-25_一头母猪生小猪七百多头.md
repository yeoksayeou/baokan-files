A sow belonging to Zheng Decai, a member of the Yongguang Cooperative in Pingle Township, Muba District, Suiyang County, has been raising pigs for twenty-nine years. She has given birth to sixty-one litters, producing seven hundred and thirty-eight piglets, of which seven hundred and twenty-nine survived.

From the first litter of piglets, Zheng Decai would breed the sow as soon as the piglets reached one month old, so he could get three litters of piglets in one year every five or six years. In twenty-nine years, he got a total of sixty-one litters. This pig is still alive, but because it is too old, it has great difficulty getting up and lying down.

The miracle created by Zheng Decai does not involve any mysterious secrets. It is based on the many well-known tasks that she has been doing day after day for twenty-nine years. Zheng Decai always finds tender wild grass, vegetable leaves, and radishes that the pigs like to eat. When feeding them, she washes them clean, chops them finely, boils water and adds it to the bran in a pot until it is soft. She then scoops it out and feeds it to the pigs when it is no longer hot. The pigsty is cleaned very thoroughly. When the pigs are almost full, she grabs a little salt (about one qian) and a handful of bran, puts it in the trough, and the pigs quickly eat the remaining food in the trough. Then, she washes the trough clean and covers it. Every time a piglet is born, she immediately dries it off and places it under the sow's belly to suckle. After two months, the piglets are weaned and sold, each weighing about twenty jin, some reaching twenty-five jin.

    一头母猪生小猪七百多头
    绥阳县募坝区坪乐乡永光社社员郑德才，一头母猪养了二十九年，生小猪六十一胎，产小猪七百三十八头，活七百二十九头。
    郑德才从母猪产第一胎起，都是小猪刚满月，母猪打圈就行配种，所以每隔五、六年就能在一年内得三胎小猪，二十九年里共得了六十一胎。这头猪现在还活着，不过因太老了，起卧都十分费力。
    郑德才创造的这个奇迹，并没有什么神秘的妙方，而是她能二十九年如一日的作到了许多人都熟知的工作。郑德才总要给猪找爱吃的嫩野草，菜叶，萝卜等。吃时还要洗得干干净净，切细，把水烧开与糠一起放进锅，嫩软，舀出来等不烫手时给猪吃。猪圈打扫得很清洁。等到猪要吃饱时就抓一点盐（约一钱左右）和一把糠放到槽里，猪很快吃完槽内余食。随即将槽洗净盖好。每生一只小猪，她立即给擦干，放在母猪腹下吃奶。小猪双月后断奶出售，每个体重都在二十斤左右，有的达二十五斤重。
