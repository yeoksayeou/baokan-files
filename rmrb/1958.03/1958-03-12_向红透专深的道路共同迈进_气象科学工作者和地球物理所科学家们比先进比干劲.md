    Advancing Together on the Road to Being Both Red and Expert
    Meteorological Scientists and Geophysical Institute Scientists Compete to Be Advanced and Work Hard
    (Our newspaper reports) The scientific workers of the Central Meteorological Bureau in Beijing held a meeting on the evening of March 11th to discuss the open letter from the scientists of the Institute of Geophysics, and unanimously expressed their determination to make a great leap forward. They also issued "A Letter in Reply to the Scientists of the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences." The full text of the letter is as follows:
    Today, the People's Daily published your open letter to the scientific community. After reading it, we immediately held a discussion, and everyone was extremely excited and encouraged. Under the leadership of the Party, and through the rectification movement, you have undergone arduous ideological struggles and achieved a great leap forward in thought. In this respect, you have taken a step ahead of us. You have an extremely profound understanding of "Ideological leap forward is the prerequisite for scientific leap forward." These experiences have greatly inspired us and further deepened our understanding of the greatness of the Party's rectification movement.
    As meteorological scientists, due to our similar professions, we have frequent contact in our daily work and academic research over the past few years, and we also have similarities in our personal ideological situations, as we all grew up in the old society. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have been shouldering important work in the national meteorological business and technology. Although we have also done some work, due to the many bad ideas brought from the old society in our minds, they will inevitably be reflected in our actual work, thus causing many wasteful facts and conservative phenomena. We are also carrying out the "double-anti" rectification movement under the leadership of the Party. We must learn from your experiences and insights, actively participate in the movement, and further examine the specific business and research work of the past, and continue to launch a resolute struggle against various wasteful phenomena and conservative thoughts. We will not only bravely expose our own mistakes, but also boldly criticize the shortcomings of others, so as to destroy bourgeois ideology and establish socialist ideology. On the basis of ideological leap forward, we will further carry out the leap forward in meteorological business scientific research. We are comrades in scientific work with you, and we must be your comrades in the rectification movement, and strive to move forward together on the road to being both Red and expert! In the spirit of revolutionary competition, we put forward the following specific conditions for comparing who is more advanced and who works harder:
    1.  Hand our hearts over to the Party, thoroughly examine the shortcomings or errors in work and thought in the "double-anti" movement, overcome the "five airs," eliminate capitalism and promote proletarian ideology, and resolutely strive to be leftists.
    2.  Guarantee to study Marxism-Leninism hard in the future, actively participate in labor training, integrate with workers and peasants, establish working-class and peasant ideological feelings, and further consolidate the revolutionary worldview.
    3.  Guarantee to contribute all our knowledge and energy to the people's meteorological cause, and do everything possible to promote the leap forward of meteorological science and technology.
    4.  Sincerely and earnestly learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, and learn from the Soviet scientists' working attitude, spirit, and methods.
    5.  Guarantee to make the greatest achievements in the specific business or research work assigned by the Party.

    向红透专深的道路共同迈进
    气象科学工作者和地球物理所科学家们比先进比干劲
    本报讯　中央气象局在京科学工作者3月11日晚集会，对地球物理研究所科学家们的公开信进行了讨论，一致表示了大跃进的决心，并发出了“复中国科学院地球物理研究所科学家们的一封公开信”。信的全文如下：
    今天人民日报登载了你们致科学界的公开信，我们看到后，立即进行了座谈，大家都异常兴奋和鼓舞。你们在党的领导下，在整风运动中，经过艰苦的思想斗争，获得了思想上的大跃进。在这方面，你们比我们先走了一步。你们对“思想跃进是科学跃进的前提”体会极为深刻。这些体会，对我们启发很大，进一步认识了党的整风运动的伟大。
    作为气象科学工作者的我们，由于专业相近，几年来日常工作和学术研究上，我们经常接触，而且在个人思想情况方面，我们亦有相同之处，都是从旧社会成长起来的。自中华人民共和国建国不久，我们就担负着全国气象业务技术方面的重要工作。虽然也作了些工作，但由于头脑中还有许多旧社会带来的坏思想，一定会反映到实际工作中去，因而造成不少的浪费事实和保守现象。我们也正在党的领导下进行双反的整风运动，我们一定学习你们的经验和体会，积极地参加运动，从进一步检查过去具体的业务工作和研究工作，对各种浪费现象和保守思想继续展开坚决的斗争。不但勇敢地揭露自己的错误，而且大胆地批评别人的缺点，从而破资产阶级思想，立社会主义思想。在思想跃进的基础上，进一步开展气象业务科学研究工作的跃进。我们同你们是科学工作方面的同道者，一定在整风运动中作你们的同道者，争取向红透专深的道路共同迈进！在革命竞赛的精神下，向你们提出比先进比干劲的几项具体条件：
    1、把心交给党，在双反运动中彻底检查工作中和思想上的缺点或错误，克服“五气”，灭资兴无，坚决争取做左派。
    2、保证今后努力学习马列主义，积极参加劳动锻炼，与工农打成一片，建立工农的思想感情，进一步巩固革命人生观。
    3、保证把全部知识和精力，贡献给人民气象事业，想尽一切办法促进气象科学技术的跃进。
    4、诚心诚意地学习苏联先进科学技术，并学习苏联科学家的工作态度、精神与方法。
    5、保证在党所分配的具体业务或研究工作中，做出最大的成绩。
