　　Serving Industrial and Agricultural Production, Accelerating the Development of Scientific Undertakings
　　Shanghai's Scientific Community Engages in Comprehensive Collaboration
　　A Powerful Scientific and Technological Contingent Has Been Formed

　　(Our newspaper Shanghai, March 26th, reporter Yu Huiyin reports) Scientific research institutions, universities, and business departments in Shanghai have organized themselves and established a scientific and technological contingent that cooperates with each other in a comprehensive manner to serve the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and promote the great development of scientific undertakings.

　　This afternoon, nearly two thousand scientists, professors, and engineers in Shanghai held a conference at which the official establishment of nine city-wide collaboration groups was announced, including mechanical, electrical, shipbuilding, chemical, chemical engineering, metallurgy, light industry, textile, civil engineering and construction, medicine, agriculture, and aquatic products. Collaboration groups in mathematics, physics, mechanics, and biology will also be established soon. The tasks of these collaboration groups are, first, to organize forces and take all effective measures to ensure the rapid, good, and economical completion of important scientific and technological research projects and Sino-Soviet technical cooperation projects entrusted by the state. Second, to propose a city-wide scientific and technological research plan within two months, determine key tasks and important research topics, identify the main responsible units, collaborating units, completion deadlines, and measures for implementing the plan, ensuring that Shanghai will gradually develop into a modern industrial base for chemical industry, precision machinery, instruments, telecommunications equipment, small steel products, shipbuilding and repair, high-end products of light and textile industries, various cultural goods, and high-quality cultural products, according to the resolutions of the Municipal Party Congress. Research topics not included in the city-wide plan will be organized and coordinated by the groups. Each collaboration group is also responsible for planning and implementing the training of a red and expert working-class cadre contingent in each field. Solving the cooperative and coordinating relationship between education, scientific research, and some business departments, and comprehensively considering the training of cadres, the development of production, the promotion of scientific research, and the improvement of teaching, are among the major measures taken by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee in the rectification movement. As early as November of last year, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, fourteen intra-party coordination groups were established according to business nature. From that time on, various units began to universally link up and help each other in order to unleash the potential of talent and equipment, and solve urgently needed problems. For example, Shanghai First and Second Medical Colleges and Second Military Medical University jointly supported Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, strengthening the leadership and teaching staff of this newly established school in a short period of time. East China Textile Institute of Technology and the textile industry department jointly formulated a plan to train veteran cadres and young workers in the textile system to become red experts, and to ensure that the proportion of workers and peasants among students at the Textile Institute of Technology reaches 80% within five years. In order to cooperate with the development of local industry and solve the difficulty of insufficient technical strength in local industry, scientific research institutions, universities, and factories cooperated to carry out special research on the comprehensive utilization of coal, man-made fibers, and instruments.

　　In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, various units revealed the wasteful phenomena of duplicated topics and separate efforts in scientific research. After criticizing individualism, departmentalism, and decentralization in research work and the serious waste caused by them, the cooperative relationship further developed and a gratifying new trend quickly emerged. The cooperative relationship developed from bilateral and multilateral to city-wide cooperation. Experts from five scientific research institutes and two medical colleges formed a city-wide tumor research group to carry out research on this urgent and major problem in physiology and medicine from various perspectives. More than ten industrial, scientific research, and educational units jointly established a city-wide solar energy utilization research group, responsible for researching and manufacturing equipment that directly uses solar energy to serve production and construction, and supplying the needs of various regions. Inter-school teaching and research groups have emerged among universities, using existing human and material resources to help schools with difficulties open courses and train teachers.

　　Shanghai's various systems have ninety-five research institutes (rooms) and nineteen universities. Shanghai scientists have undertaken twenty-nine of the fifty-seven tasks of national important science and technology, including one hundred and sixty-six central problems and six hundred and fifty-seven topics. According to incomplete statistics, there are four hundred and ninety-eight important scientific and technological research topics in eight aspects of Shanghai's local industry. To accomplish the major tasks of these research problems requires comprehensive cooperation and comprehensive arrangements. Now, with the establishment of regular collaboration groups with the participation of experts from various parties inside and outside the Party, proceeding from the overall situation and considering long-term interests, Shanghai's scientific and technological potential will inevitably be fully utilized.

　　Liu Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai and Minister of Education and Health of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, spoke at today's conference. He analyzed the current situation, pointed out that a new situation of taking the lead and a galloping surge has emerged on the production front, and a high tide of cultural construction has come with overwhelming force. He hoped that scientific and technological workers would aim high in the socialist great leap forward, closely link theory with practice, cooperate fully, and serve the great leap forward in production with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    为工农业生产服务　加速科学事业发展
    上海科学界全面大协作
    一支强大的科学技术大军已经组成
    本报上海26日电　记者余辉音报道：上海各科学研究机关、高等学校和业务部门已经组织起来，建立了一支互相配合，全面协作的科学技术大军，以服务于工农业生产的大跃进和促进科学事业的大发展。
    今天下午，上海近二千个科学家、教授、工程师举行大会，会上正式宣布成立了机械电机造船、化学化工、冶金、轻工业、纺织、土木建筑、医药、农业、水产等九个全市性的协作小组。数学、物理力学、生物等方面的协作小组也即将建立。这些协作小组的任务是，组织力量，采取一切有效措施，首先保证多快好省地完成国家委托的重要科学技术研究项目和中苏技术合作项目。其次，在两个月内提出全市科学技术研究规划，定出重点任务和重要研究课题，确定研究课题的主要负责单位、协作单位、完成期限以及实现规划的措施，保证根据市党代会决议，使上海逐步发展成为化学工业、精密机械、仪表、电讯器材、小型钢材、船舶修造、轻纺工业高级产品、各种文化用品和文化精制品等现代化工业基地。对不列入全市规划的研究课题，由小组组织平衡协调。各个协作小组还负责分别规划和执行培养各个方面的又红又专的工人阶级干部队伍。解决教育、科学研究和部分业务部门之间的相互合作和协调关系，全面考虑培养干部、发展生产、推动科学研究、改进教学等问题，这是中共上海市委在整改运动中采取的重大措施之一。早在去年11月，在市委的直接领导下，已按业务性质成立了十四个党内的协调小组。从那时起，各单位之间开始普遍挂钩，互相帮助，以发挥人材和设备的潜力，解决了迫切需要解决的问题。例如，上海第一、第二医学院和第二军医大学共同支援上海中医学院，短期内加强了这所新建学校的领导和师资力量。华东纺织工学院和纺织工业部门共同拟定了培养纺织系统老干部和青年工人成为红色专家、五年内使纺织工学院学生中工农成分达到80％的方案。为了配合地方工业的发展，解决地方工业技术力量不足的困难，科学研究机关、高等学校和工厂合作开展了煤的综合利用、人造纤维、仪器仪表等项专题研究。
    在反浪费反保守运动中，各单位揭发出科学研究上还存在着题目重复、各搞一套的浪费现象。在批判了研究工作中的个人主义、本位主义、分散主义以及由此造成的严重浪费以后，协作关系更进一步地发展起来，很快地出现了一个可喜的新趋势。协作关系由双边、多边而向全市性的协作发展。五个科学研究所和二个医学院有关专家组成了一个全市性的肿瘤研究小组，从各个不同的方面对生理学和医学上的这一亟待解决的重大问题开展研究。十多个工业、科学研究、教育单位联合成立了全市性的太阳能利用的研究工作组，负责研究和制造直接利用太阳能为生产建设服务的器械，供应各地的需要。在高等学校之间出现了校际教研组，利用现有的人力物力帮助有困难的学校开课和培养师资。
    上海各系统有九十五个研究所（室），十九所高等学校。上海科学家承担了国家重要科学技术的五十七项任务中的二十九项，包括一百六十六个中心问题、六百五十七个课题。据不完全统计，上海地方工业八个方面的重要科学技术研究题目，又有四百九十八个。要完成这些研究问题的重大任务，需要全面协作，全面安排。现在，有党内外各方面专家参加的，从全局出发，从长远利益考虑的经常性协作小组的成立，必然可以使上海的科学技术潜力得到充分的发挥。
    上海市副市长、中共上海市委教育卫生部部长刘季平，在今天大会上讲了话。他分析了当前形势，指出生产战线上已经出现了一马当先、万马奔腾的新形势，文化建设高潮已经排山倒海而来，希望科学技术工作者在社会主义大跃进中立大志，作到理论密切联系实际，通力协作，为多快好省的生产大跃进服务。
