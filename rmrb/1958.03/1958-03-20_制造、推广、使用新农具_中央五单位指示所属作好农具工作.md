Manufacturing, Promoting, and Using New Farm Tools
Five Central Units Instruct Subordinates to Do a Good Job in Farm Tool Work

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture, the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives, and the Head Office of the People's Bank of China jointly issued instructions on March 10 regarding strengthening cooperation to do a good job in farm tool work for 1958.

The instructions pointed out that it is necessary to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, promote the revolutionary vigor of socialism, and take active and effective measures to vigorously promote new-style farm tools and improved farm tools. Great importance must be attached to improving old-style farm tools. It is necessary to strengthen investigation and research and improve them according to local conditions. Improved farm tools that have been tested and appraised, reviewed by the masses, and proven effective can be manufactured and promoted locally; however, quality must be guaranteed to avoid losses. It is necessary to strengthen technical guidance, parts supply, and repair work to put all the new-style farm tools that have been promoted into use and fully utilize their effectiveness.

The instructions pointed out that in the future, the manufacture and promotion of new-style farm tools will be planned locally, produced and sold locally, with the central government assisting in adjusting surpluses and shortages.

The instructions pointed out that regarding farm tool loans, this year's farm loans for each province have been decided to be used by each province under a contract system, and no special quotas will be set for various loans. Agricultural cooperatives should try their best to purchase the farm tools being promoted with self-raised funds. Active loan support should be given to those parts that agricultural cooperatives are truly unable to solve after careful calculation and tapping of potential.

The instructions pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research and conduct comprehensive planning. With the development of agricultural production, the variety and models of farm tools required are increasing. Relevant departments should make unified plans under the unified leadership of the local Party and government. When designing new types of farm tools, experimental research departments should try to make the farm tools universal and versatile to improve the utilization rate of farm tools. All kinds of power should be comprehensively utilized. First of all, the breeding and feeding management of draught animals should be strengthened. Secondly, we should also make full use of all available power sources such as manpower, wind power, water power, electricity, and tractors.

    制造、推广、使用新农具
    中央五单位指示所属作好农具工作
    据新华社15日讯　第一机械工业部、第二商业部、农业部、中华全国手工业合作总社和中国人民银行总行，于10日联合发出关于加强协作作好1958年农具工作的指示。
    指示指出，必须克服右倾保守思想，发扬社会主义的革命干劲，采取积极有效的措施，大力推广新式农具和改良农具。对改良旧式农具必须十分重视。必须加强调查研究，因地制宜地予以改良。已改良的经过试验鉴定，群众评议，有成效的即可就地制造，就地推广；但必须保证质量，避免损失。必须加强技术指导、零件供应和修配工作，把已推广出去的新式农具全部使用起来，充分发挥其效能。
    指示指出，今后新式农具的制造推广，由地方自行计划，自产自销，中央协助调剂余缺。
    指示指出，关于农具贷款问题，今年各省的农贷已经决定交由各省包干使用，对各项贷款不划定专款指标。推广的农具应尽量由农业社以自筹资金购买，对农业社精打细算挖掘潜力之后，确实无力解决的部分，应积极给予贷款支持。
    指示指出，加强调查研究，进行全面规划。随着农业生产的发展，要求的农具品种型号越来越多。有关部门应在当地党政统一领导下，作出统一规划。试验研究部门在设计新品种的农具时，应尽量使农具通用、万能，提高农具的利用率。对各种动力应当综合利用。首先应加强耕畜的繁殖和饲养管理。其次还应该充分利用现有的人力、风力、水力、电力、拖拉机等一切可以利用的动力。
