    A New Trend
    I needed the "China Youth Daily" from this year's New Year's Day, and on March 19th, I went to the Hepingli Post Office in this city to ask for their help in buying it. Comrade Qi from this office could not find it, but he asked me to leave my address and phone number. The next day, Comrade Qi called and said that the newspaper had been found and would be mailed to me that day.
    This new trend of not disdaining small matters, not being afraid of trouble, and being seriously responsible to the demands of the masses is worth learning from for all of us.　Beijing Municipality　Cao Zhuo

    新风尚
    我需要今年元旦的中国青年报，3月19日，就去本市和平里邮局请他们帮助买一下。这个局的齐同志没有找到，但他要我留下地址和电话。第二天，齐同志来电话说报纸已经找到，当天就给我寄来。
    这种不嫌事小，不怕麻烦，对群众要求认真负责的新风尚，值得我们大家学习。　北京市　曹焯
