    A Brave Attempt
    ——Watching the "White Haired Girl" by the Yanming Peking Opera Troupe
    Zhao Zongwen
    Amidst the great leap forward in the literary and art circles, I saw the "White Haired Girl" performed by the Yanming Peking Opera Troupe. This was a brave attempt, a lightning-fast assault. The play was rehearsed in just ten days, but the first night's performance was warmly welcomed by the entire audience.

    I went to see this play with anticipation. To be honest, I had some concerns about their blitz performance. However, after watching the play, the audience's emotions were enthusiastic, and the repeated curtain calls indicated that the audience was generally satisfied with their courageous attempt and the results of the performance.

    What made us happy was the troupe's drive. It is said that when they decided to perform this play, they didn't even have a script. As a result, the script was written by the directors and actors as they rehearsed, and it wasn't finalized until the dress rehearsal. The rehearsal time was too short, so everyone rehearsed day and night to ensure that all preparations were completed without hindering regular performances. We watched the first performance and felt that the entire troupe was still in high spirits and performing seriously, with no signs of being "rushed." The main lyrics in the play were also written quite beautifully. For example, Zhao Yanxia's flowing aria in the first act after Yang Bailao ties the red tassel to Xi'er, and the impassioned Gaobozi aria sung by Xi'er after becoming the White Haired Girl, were both refreshing and delightful. The handling of the characters and scenes was also well arranged in several places, especially the scene where Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi used both soft and hard tactics to force Yang Bailao to sell his daughter, which was particularly moving.

    Can the performance of this play be considered a success? I think this needs to be looked at from two perspectives. From the perspective of boldly trying and finally successfully performing on schedule, this performance should be considered a success. However, if the requirements are raised a bit, from the perspective of artistic integrity, then this performance still has many areas worth discussing. The main issue is the lack of unity and harmony in the performance art and style.

    Whether modern life scripts can be performed in the form of Peking Opera is still a matter of unresolved debate. Why is this issue relatively easy to resolve for other local opera genres, but particularly difficult for Peking Opera? My personal opinion is that this is mainly because, among all local operas, Peking Opera's artistic performance form is relatively complete and sophisticated. Over a long period, through the artistic practice of countless performing artists and repeated testing among the broad masses of the people, it has formed a relatively solidified performance form with established conventions and style that are familiar and loved by the broad masses. Can these conventions be broken? Past and recent attempts have shown that it is not absolutely impossible. Here, from which angle to break through, and to what extent, are issues worthy of careful study. This attempt by the Yanming Troupe seems to indicate that they intend to break through the inherent conventions from the following two points. That is, in addition to costumes and makeup, first, the dialogue does not use rhyming prose, and second, in terms of acting, they boldly abandoned many performance styles unique to Peking Opera art, such as stylized body movements, actions, and steps. Now it seems that using ordinary language instead of rhyming prose is not a big problem. However, in addition to removing water sleeves, etc., due to costume limitations, if many elements unique to Peking Opera art are abandoned in terms of body movements and actions, such as the light steps, rubbing steps, stamping steps, walking the edge, and circular movements, then the audience will see this as nothing more than "spoken drama with singing" and no longer Peking Opera. On this point, I think the Yanming Troupe's trial performance has "severed love" from the traditions of Peking Opera art even more thoroughly than "Three Great Mountains" and "Ashima," and whether doing so is appropriate and whether it can be accepted by the vast Peking Opera enthusiasts is still worth studying.

    Another area that seems unharmonious is the lack of unity in performance art. Because the main actors in this play boldly broke through and abandoned the inherent conventions of Peking Opera performance art, they seemed to be striving to take the path of realistic performance methods of spoken drama. In this way, disharmony occurred between singing, acting, and speaking, and the performance methods of this actor and that actor showed disunity. Regarding this, my personal opinion is that opera and Peking Opera are, after all, not spoken drama. The main focus of realistic performance methods should be on the inner self, not necessarily on achieving "likeness" in form. Therefore, excessively pursuing formal and detailed realism will instead damage the higher truth.

    Recently, the attendance at theaters in Beijing has not been very good, but as soon as this play was posted, it was a full house on the first day. This shows that the people welcome new plays and appreciate the artists' courageous attempts. The purpose of writing this post-viewing reflection is, on the one hand, to express admiration for the courage and drive of the Peking Opera community, and on the other hand, to offer some extremely immature opinions for the study of friends in the drama community.

    一次勇敢的尝试
    ——看燕鸣京剧团的“白毛女”
    赵宗文
    在文艺界大跃进声中，看到了燕鸣京剧团的“白毛女”，这是一次勇敢的尝试，这也是一次闪电式的突击，戏是在十天之内排出来的，可是第一晚演出就获得了全场观众的热烈的欢迎。
    我带着期待的心情去看这出戏，老实说，我对他们的这一次突击演出，也不无危虑之感，可是，看完了戏，观众的情绪是热烈的，一次再一次的谢幕，说明了观众对他们这种勇敢的尝试，和演出的成绩，基本上是满意的。
    使我们感到高兴的，是这个剧团的干劲。听说，决定要演这个戏的时候，他们还没有剧本，结果，剧本是导演演员们边排边写，直到彩排之前才定稿的，排演时间太短，大家就卜昼卜夜地排练，保证在不妨碍经常演出的前提下做好一切准备工作。我们看了第一场，觉得依然是全团精神饱满，演出认真，看不出“赶”出来的迹象。戏里主要的唱词，也写得相当优美。例如第一场杨白劳给喜儿系上红绒线之后赵燕侠同志唱的一段流水，和喜儿成了白毛女以后唱的一段激昂的高拨子，都是清新可喜。对于人物场面的处理，有几处也安排得很好，其中黄世仁、穆仁智软硬兼施，迫取杨白劳卖女文契那一场，特别使人感动。
    是不是这个戏的演出可以说成功了呢？这我以为要从两方面来看。单从勇敢试演而终于胜利地如期演出这一点来说，这次演出应该说是成功的了，但是把要求提得高一点，从艺术的完整这一角度来说，那么这一次的演出也还有许多值得商榷的地方。这主要的就是表演艺术上、风格上的不统一、不和谐的问题。
    能不能用京剧形式来演现代生活的剧本，这直到今天还是一个争论未决的问题。为什么别的地方剧种对这个问题比较容易解决而京剧特别困难？我个人看法认为这主要是因为在一切地方戏曲中，京剧的艺术表演形式比较的完整圆熟，在长期间经过了无数表演艺术家的艺术实践，和在广大人民群众中的反复考验，它已经形成了一种表演形式上相当凝固而又已为广大群众所习惯和喜爱了的程式和风格。这种程式是否可以突破？从过去和近年来的许多尝试中证明，并不是绝对不可能的事情，在此，从哪一个角度来突破，和突破到什么程度，这就是值得慎重研究的问题。这次燕鸣剧团的尝试，看起来似乎他们打算从以下这两点来突破固有的程式的。这就是除出服装化装之外，第一是对话不用韵白，第二是演技方面大胆地抛弃了许多京剧艺术特有的表演样式，例如舞蹈化了的身段、动作、步法等等。现在看来，不用韵白而用普通语言，似乎问题不大，可是，在因为服装限制而取消了水袖等等之外，在身段、动作方面再抛弃了许多京剧艺术所特有的东西，如步法中的俏步、搓步、蹋步、走边、圆场等等，那么观众看来，这就只不过是“话剧加唱”而已经不是京剧了。在这一点上，我以为燕鸣剧团的这次试演，对京剧艺术的传统“割爱”得比“三座山”、“阿诗玛”还要彻底，而这样做是否妥当、是否能为广大的京剧爱好者所接受，还是很值得研究的。
    另一个显得不调和的地方，是表演艺术方面的不统一。由于这出戏中的几个主要演员大胆地突破和抛弃了京剧表演艺术的固有程式，所以他们似乎竭力在走话剧的现实主义的表演方法的路子。这样，唱、做、念之间发生了不和谐，这个演员和那个演员的表演方法上又显出了不统一。对此，我个人意见认为歌剧、京剧终于不是话剧，现实主义的表演方法主要的应该是在内心而不一定要在形式上做到“像真”，所以，过分地追求形式上、细节上的真实，反而会破坏更高的真实性的。
    最近北京的剧场上座不太好，可是这出戏一贴出，第一天就来了一个满堂，这说明人民群众是欢迎新的剧目的，也是欢迎艺人们的这种勇敢的尝试的。我写这一段观后感的目的，一方面是为了对京剧界的这种勇气和干劲表示钦佩，另一方面是提出一些极不成熟的意见，供戏剧界朋友的研究。
