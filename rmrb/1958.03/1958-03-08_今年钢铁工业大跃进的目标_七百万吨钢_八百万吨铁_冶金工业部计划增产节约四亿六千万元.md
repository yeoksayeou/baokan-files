Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, through the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, has formulated a comprehensive leap forward plan for increasing production and practicing economy, determining that this year it will increase profits turned over to the state and save investment and operating expenses totaling 460 million yuan, striving to achieve the national steel production target of seven million tons.

Now, to ensure the realization of the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, the ministry has put forward the slogan that the funds used to build one factory in the first Five-Year Plan should be used to build two factories in the second Five-Year Plan, and the construction speed should be doubled compared to the first Five-Year Plan.

The formulation of the ministry's plan for increasing production and practicing economy is the crystallization of a mass ideological leap forward that emerged during the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign. In the past twenty-odd days, the flames of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" have burned brightly throughout the ministry, with all seven thousand employees posting more than two hundred thousand big-character posters, forming a general attack on all wasteful phenomena and various conservative ideas and unhealthy tendencies. After the initial development of the campaign, the ministry's leadership made several major calculations. Originally, they had only proposed increasing steel production by 450,000 tons and pig iron production by 400,000 tons compared to the state plan for this year. However, as the campaign deepened, the masses also started making major calculations from both economic and political perspectives, concerning themselves with state affairs. As a result, a situation of "layers adding more, steps increasing higher" emerged. After a fierce attack on various conservative ideas from top to bottom and left to right, the ministry has now determined that this year it will increase steel production by 550,000 tons and pig iron production by 450,000 tons. Adding the steel production increases from other central industrial departments and local industries, the country can increase steel production by 760,000 tons this year. Steel and pig iron production will reach seven million tons and eight million tons respectively, increasing by 33% and 35% compared to last year's actual figures.

In terms of capital construction, the ministry requires that all investment and operating expenses be saved for the state this year, totaling 230 million yuan, and that the saved funds be used for urgent productive construction projects. In this way, some important projects of steel enterprises in Anshan, Daye, Taiyuan and other places can be put into production one to three months ahead of schedule, increasing steel production for the state by 160,000 tons this year. Furthermore, more than ten construction projects originally scheduled for 1959 in Ma'anshan, Baoji, Chengdu, Hainan Island, Kunming and other places can be brought forward to this year, ensuring greater growth in steel production and variety next year and the year after.

When arranging the progress of various capital construction projects this year, the ministry's Capital Construction Department carefully analyzed and studied all aspects of the conditions, considering shortening the construction period of important steel bases such as Baotou Steel and Wuhan Steel by more than one year.

According to the revelations in the big-character posters, if bureaucratism and various unhealthy tendencies are removed from the leadership's work, waste and losses can be avoided and enormous potential can be tapped at any time and any place. The total value of various capital construction equipment accumulated by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry over the past few years has reached 60 million yuan. Seven rock drills were stored in the warehouses of production units. Not only have they not been used for four years, but they were also said to have been lost and were requested to be written off. A newly built enterprise even held a banquet for guests for three days to celebrate its opening. The supply department once mistakenly allocated a batch of materials that should have been allocated to Shaanxi to Shanxi. The only difference between these names wasted more than 10,000 yuan on transportation fees. A big-character poster entitled "One Careless Mistake, Loss of 18,000" revealed that an employee of an enterprise was fined 18,000 yuan because he was careless in his work and did not pay the enterprise's taxes to the state on time. These sharp criticisms of all forms of bureaucratism, extravagance, and stagnation have aroused huge repercussions among leaders and the masses.

### 今年钢铁工业大跃进的目标  七百万吨钢　八百万吨铁  冶金工业部计划增产节约四亿六千万元

    今年钢铁工业大跃进的目标
    七百万吨钢　八百万吨铁
    冶金工业部计划增产节约四亿六千万元
    据新华社7日讯　冶金工业部通过反浪费反保守运动，已订出一个全面跃进的增产节约计划，确定今年要为国家多增加上缴利润和节约投资与事业费共四亿六千万元，为实现全国钢产量达到七百万吨的任务而奋斗。
    现在，为保证增产节约计划的实现，这个部已提出第一个五年计划中建设一个工厂的资金要在第二个五年计划中争取建设两个工厂，建设速度要比第一个五年快一倍的行动口号。
    这个部的增产节约计划的制订，是反浪费反保守运动中出现群众性的思想大跃进的结晶。二十多天来，这个部鸣放的烈火已烧得满天通红，全部七千来人贴出二十多万张大字报，形成对一切浪费现象和各种保守思想与歪风邪气的总攻击。这个部的领导上在运动初步展开后算了几笔大账，原来只提出今年比国家计划增产四十五万吨钢，四十万吨生铁；随着运动的逐步深入，群众也都从经济上政治上算开了大账，大家关心国家的事务，结果出现了“层层加码，步步增高”的形势。经过上下左右对各种保守思想的猛烈攻击，部里现在已确定今年要增产五十五万吨钢、四十五万吨生铁。加上中央其他工业部门和地方工业的钢铁增产数字，今年全国钢就可以增产七十六万吨，钢和生铁的产量将分别达到七百万吨和八百万吨，比去年实际完成数字提高33％和35％。
    在基本建设方面，要求做到今年全部为国家节约投资和事业费二亿三千万元，把节约下来的资金用到紧迫的生产性建设工程上去。这样，鞍山、大冶、太原等地钢铁企业的一些重要工程，就可以提前一个月到三个月投入生产，在今年为国家增产十六万吨钢，并且还可以把马鞍山、宝鸡、成都、海南岛、昆明等地原订1959年施工的十多个建设项目，提前到今年施工，保证明年和后年钢铁产量及品种有更多的增长。
    这个部的基本建设司在安排今年的各项基本建设工程进度时，认真地分析研究了各方面的条件，考虑把包钢、武钢等重要钢铁基地的建设期限缩短一年以上的时间。
    根据大字报的揭露，领导工作中如果去掉了官风和各种歪风邪气，就可以随时随地避免浪费和损失，挖掘出巨大的潜力。冶金部几年来积压的各种基本建设设备总值达六千万元，有七台凿岩机积压在生产单位的仓库里，四年来不仅没有使用，反而说已经丢失了，要求销账。有一个新建企业在庆祝开工时，竟然大宴宾客三天。供应部门有一次将一批应该拨到陕西的材料错误地拨到山西，仅一字之差，就浪费运费一万多元。有一张题为“一回马大哈，损失一万八”的大字报，揭露了有个企业的工作人员因为工作中粗枝大叶，没有按时向国家交纳企业应纳的税款，就被处罚款一万八千元。这种种对一切官气、阔气和暮气的尖锐批评，在领导和群众中引起了巨大的反响。
