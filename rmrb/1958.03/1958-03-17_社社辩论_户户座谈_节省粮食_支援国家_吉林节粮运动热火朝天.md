Xinhua News Agency, Changchun Special Dispatch: During Jilin Province's Grain Conservation Movement Propaganda Month, a massive grain conservation movement was universally launched. Sales volume across the province decreased by 14.6% compared to January.

Currently, the slogan proposed by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Save one liang of grain per person per day," has been implemented throughout the province. Since February, political education work has been vigorously carried out in both urban and rural areas across the province. It is estimated that grain sales in the first quarter of this year will decrease by 10.3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Many government agencies and schools have already exceeded their February conservation plans. In the vast rural areas, every township and commune has launched major debates on saving grain to support the nation. According to incomplete statistics from only thirteen counties and cities, 110 million jin of grain saved has already been delivered to the national treasury.

Before the Grain Conservation Propaganda Month, from July of last year to January of this year, the average monthly sales volume in cities exceeded the prescribed target by 4,000 tons. When the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call for grain conservation, some leading cadres and the masses had right-leaning conservative ideas, fearing that there would not be enough to eat, and even held the idea of "saving to the limit." On February 6th, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial broadcast conference to comprehensively explain the great significance of saving grain to support industrial construction, and calculated the detailed account of grain supply. Local Party committees and grain management departments conducted in-depth investigations into the actual consumption of residents. According to a survey of twenty-five households in Siping City claiming to be short of grain, they not only were not short but also had surplus grain. A survey of 15,000 households in Linjiang County showed that 78% of farmers had savings. After these persuasive situations were presented, not only did leading cadres have a clear understanding, but the general public also dispelled the mood of "saving to the limit," and a vigorous grain conservation movement was quickly launched.

During Propaganda Month, urban government agencies and street residents, after propaganda and discussions, have achieved universal awareness. Some residents have launched competitions with each other, and various government agencies and factories have launched competitions to see who eats well and saves the most. The Jilin Provincial People's Committee's agency canteen promotes the method of cooking with provincial grain, saving 1.2 liang of grain per person per day. In the vast rural areas, many townships and communes have launched major debates on grain conservation. Leading cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives generally guarantee that, based on this year's three-fixed quota, they will save 10% of their rations. Workers and farmers in Panshi County voluntarily saved 12 million jin of grain. The Yantongshan District Agricultural Cooperative in the county dispatched 410 carts to sell 320,000 jin of saved grain after the broadcast conference. Townships and communes in Dongliao County reported saving more than 30 million jin of grain.

In order to persist in the grain conservation movement, a provincial broadcast conference for exchanging experiences was held again on March 3rd. The conference proposed to further help agricultural cooperatives and residents arrange their family grain consumption.

    社社辩论　户户座谈　节省粮食　支援国家
    吉林节粮运动热火朝天
    本报特约新华社长春专讯  吉林省在举办节约粮食运动宣传月中，普遍展开了声势浩大的节约粮食运动。全省销售数量比1月下降14.6％。
    目前，中共吉林省委提出的每人每天节约一两粮的口号已经在全省贯彻执行。从2月起，全省城乡大力开展政治教育工作，预计今年第一季度售粮数可比去年第四季度下降10.3％。许多机关、学校已超过了2月份节约计划。广大农村乡乡、社社展开节约粮食支援国家的大辩论，仅据十三个县市不完全统计，已把节约下的一亿一千万斤粮食送交国库。
    在举办节约粮食宣传月前，从去年7月到今年1月，每月城市销售量平均超过规定指标四千吨。当中共吉林省委提出节约粮食号召时，有些领导干部和群众存在右倾保守思想，怕不够吃，甚至存在着“节约到顶”思想。中共吉林省委在2月6日举办全省广播大会，全面解释节约粮食支援工业建设的重大意义，并算了粮食供应的细账。各地党委和粮食管理部门深入调查了居民消费量的真实情况。据四平市调查二十五户喊缺粮的居民，不仅不缺还有余粮。临江县在一万五千户中调查，78％的农户都有节余。这些有说服力的情况摆出后，不仅领导干部做到心中有数，一般群众也打消“节约到顶”情绪，就很快掀起轰轰烈烈的节约粮食运动。
    宣传月中，城市各机关、街道居民经过宣传、座谈已做到家喻户晓，有些居民个人之间、各机关工厂之间都展开了评比竞赛，比赛谁吃的又好又省。吉林省人委机关食堂，推广省粮做饭方法，每人每天节约粮食一两二钱。在广大农村里，许多乡社都展开了节约粮食大辩论。农业社领导干部和社员普遍保证，在今年三定留量基础上，口粮节约10％。磐石县全县工人、农民自愿节约粮食一千二百万斤；该县烟筒山区农业社开完广播大会就出动四百一十台大车，卖节约粮三十二万斤。东辽县各乡社自报节约粮三千多万斤。
    为把节约粮食运动坚持下去，在3月3日又举办全省交流经验广播大会，会上提出要进一步帮助农业社、居民群众安排家庭粮食消费。
