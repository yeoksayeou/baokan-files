    Tianjin University Students Engage in Labor Training in Various Positions
    The first group of over 1,200 students from Tianjin University have engaged in work-study labor production. They are involved in manual labor in various locations such as the university's machine factory, textile factory, laboratories, paper mill, and factories and farms outside the university.
    Students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering smelted their first batch of molten iron on the 11th and cast their first batch of castings, creating wealth worth 2,500 yuan for the country. Third-year students from the Department of Textile Engineering produced three bolts of cloth in just over a day using three looms. Students from the Department of Chemical Engineering actively experimented with producing medicines. Class A of the second-year organic synthesis major has successfully trial-produced two medicines, nitrobenzene and ethyl acetate. Students from the Department of Civil Engineering designed dressing rooms for the university's swimming pool, and the layout work has already begun, with construction to begin soon. Students from the Department of Architecture have contracted the plastering work for several buildings. (He Tiegang)

    天津大学同学到各种岗位劳动锻炼
    天津大学第一批一千二百余名同学投入了勤工俭学的劳动生产。他们分别到校内机工厂、纺织厂、实验室、造纸厂等处和校外工厂、农场从事体力劳动。
    机械系的同学在11日炼好了第一炉铁水，浇注了第一批铸件，为国家创造了价值二千五百元的财富。纺织系三年级同学用三台织布机花了一天多时间出产了三匹布。化工系同学纷纷试制药品。有机合成专业二年级甲班已试制成功了硝基苯和乙酸乙酯两种药品。土木系学生给学校的游泳池设计了更衣室，已进行了放线工作，不久即将施工。建筑系同学承包了几个楼的刷浆工作。　（何铁刚）
