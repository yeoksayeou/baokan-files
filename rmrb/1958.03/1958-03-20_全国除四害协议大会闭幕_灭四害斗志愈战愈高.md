Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: The National Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Great Leap Forward Comparison and Agreement Conference was held in Beijing from the 14th to the 19th. Representatives from 26 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and 38 medical colleges across the country, read out agreements on friendly competitions for the Great Leap Forward in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene between provinces and cities, between medical colleges, and between various units at the closing meeting. They proposed to mobilize the entire people, with everyone taking action, to leave sparrows with no way to fly to the heavens, rats with no way to burrow into the earth, and mosquitoes and flies with no offspring. Their action slogan is: Work hard for one, two, three, or five years to basically achieve the "four withouts" in various regions of our country; fight hard for one, two, three, or five years to basically eliminate the most serious infectious diseases harming the people.

The conference passed a resolution. The resolution stated that the mood of the Chinese people to fight against the four pests is growing stronger with each battle, and the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Campaign is advancing like ten thousand horses galloping forward at a tremendous pace. Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province proposed to work hard for one month to eliminate and exterminate the four pests; Henan Province proposed to work hard for fifty days to eliminate the four pests and report victory to Chairman Mao on May Day; Liaoning Province proposed to fight hard for three months to basically achieve the "four withouts" throughout the province. This is a revolutionary leap forward. The resolution said that fighting against the four pests and diseases is a great battle for people to improve the environment and benefit future generations, a great war to conquer nature, and a magnificent cultural revolution. The elimination of the four pests must be done quickly and decisively, vigorously, comprehensively, continuously, and repeatedly.

The resolution pointed out that the leap forward in the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Campaign will inevitably promote a Great Leap Forward in all aspects of health work. Health workers must, with revolutionary vigor, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the strength of the masses, proceed from the 600 million people, run all health undertakings diligently and frugally, and make all health undertakings leap forward according to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Every health worker must complete this Great Leap Forward with the revolutionary spirit of destroying capitalism and promoting proletarian ideology, breaking old and establishing new.

Zhang Jiafu, Deputy Director of the Second Office of the State Council, spoke at the meeting. He said that this meeting is a promotion for the current Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Campaign and the entire health work. He called on all regions to go all out, continue their efforts, and fundamentally change the national health outlook.

Zhang Jiafu pointed out that the patriotic health campaign in the past few months has been unprecedented in scale and has achieved great results. This is achieved under the correct leadership of the Party and by following the mass line. He particularly pointed out that spring is the season when mosquitoes and flies breed easily and diseases are prone to spread, and it is also a busy farming season, so production and health campaigns should be carried out simultaneously without hindering each other.

Minister of Health Li Dequan and Standing Director of the Red Cross Society of China Wu Yunfu also spoke at the meeting.

Vice Minister of Health Xu Yunbei made a concluding speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the elimination of the four pests should be done quickly and decisively, with repeated sweeps. Scientific and technological guidance has not yet kept up with the development of the movement. On the one hand, we should continue to rely on the masses, believe in the wisdom of the masses, and the masses will have new creations in the movement; on the other hand, we require scientists to go deep into the front lines, teach technology to the masses, and at the same time learn from the masses and learn new technologies from the practice of the masses that are not found in books. In ethnic minority areas, health work should be carried out with respect for ethnic customs.

    全国除四害协议大会闭幕
    灭四害斗志愈战愈高
    据新华社19日讯　全国除四害讲卫生大跃进比先进协议大会14日到19日在北京举行。来自全国二十六个省、自治区、市和三十八个医学院校的代表，在闭幕会上宣读了省市之间各医学院校之间，以及各单位之间除四害、讲卫生大跃进友谊比赛的协议书。他们提出，要全民动员，人人动手，让麻雀上天无路，老鼠入地无门，蚊蝇断子绝孙。他们的行动口号是：苦战一年、两年、三年、五年，分别在我国各地区基本上实现四无；大战一年、两年、三年、五年，把危害人民最严重的几种传染病基本上消灭。
    会议通过了一项决议。决议中说，目前我国人民和四害作斗争的情绪愈战愈高，除四害讲卫生运动有如万马奔腾，一日千里地向前迈进。安徽省阜阳专区提出苦战一月，把四害除尽灭绝；河南省提出，苦战五十天除灭四害，“五一”节向毛主席报捷；辽宁省提出，大战三个月，全省基本上做到四无。这是革命的跃进。决议说，同四害和疾病作斗争，是人们要改善环境、造福子孙万代的一场伟大的战斗，是征服自然的大战、文化革命的壮举。除四害必须速战速决，必须大力地搞、全面地搞、连续地反复地搞。
    决议指出，除四害讲卫生运动的飞跃前进，势必促进各项卫生工作的大跃进。卫生工作者要以革命干劲，在党的领导下，依靠群众力量，从六亿人民出发，勤俭办一切卫生事业，根据多快好省的方针，使各项卫生事业都飞跃地向前发展。每个卫生工作者，都必须以灭资兴无、破旧立新的革命精神来完成这一大跃进。
    国务院第二办公室副主任张稼夫在会上讲了话。他说，这次会议对当前除四害、讲卫生运动和整个卫生工作是一个促进。他要求各地鼓足干劲，再接再厉，使全国的卫生面貌根本改观。
    张稼夫指出，短短几个月的爱国卫生运动规模空前，成绩很大。这是在党的正确领导下走群众路线取得的。他特别指出，春季是蚊蝇孳生、疾病容易流行的季节，又是农忙的时候，应该做到生产和卫生运动两不误。
    卫生部部长李德全、中国红十字会总会常务理事伍云甫也在会上讲了话。
    卫生部副部长徐运北在会上作总结发言。他指出，除四害应该速战速决，反复扫荡。科学技术指导目前还跟不上运动的发展，应该一方面继续依靠群众，相信群众的智慧，群众在运动中会有新的创造；另一方面，要求科学家能深入现场，把技术教给群众，同时向群众学习，从群众的实践中学习书本上没有的新的技术。在少数民族地区应该尊重民族习惯来开展卫生工作。
