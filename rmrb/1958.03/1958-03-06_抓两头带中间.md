Grasp the Two Ends to Lead the Middle
    Wan Xiangxin
    In the Great Leap Forward of production, the leading personnel of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory successfully implemented the leadership method of "two dragons." This leadership method not only implemented the spirit of experimental fields but also provided new experience: grasp the two ends to lead the middle.
    At any time, in all enterprises, there are always three parts of people: the more active, the intermediate, and the more backward; there are always more advanced units, intermediate-level units, and backward units. Starting from this objective situation, continuously promoting the broad masses to catch up with and break through the old advanced levels can continuously improve the production and work of the enterprise. The best way to achieve this is to grasp the two ends—the advanced and the backward—to drive the intermediate state.
    Grasping the advanced is a leadership method already familiar to many enterprise leaders. Grasping advanced units or advanced figures, establishing banners, and summarizing and promoting their experiences have a very obvious role in promoting production and work. Undoubtedly, this leadership method needs to be continued and promoted. However, is it enough to only grasp the advanced? The experience of many enterprises proves that only grasping the advanced often cannot mobilize the backward masses and cannot completely change the face of backward units. Even among the masses in the intermediate state, some will be satisfied with "not as good as the top, but better than the bottom," or emphasize that objective conditions are not as good as advanced units, and still remain stagnant. If grasping the advanced is combined with grasping the backward, and the backward masses are effectively mobilized, then not only can the "dead corners" of backwardness be eliminated (this is an important sign of in-depth work), but also the "theory of conditions" can be completely broken, and all employees can be promoted to leap forward together.
    Grasping backward units in the Great Leap Forward of production is also a matter of breaking through weak links. The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, because it grasped and solved some key issues in the weak workshop—the foundry workshop—that affected the production of the entire factory, freed other workshops from worries, and they dared to propose Great Leap Forward targets, thereby promoting the Great Leap Forward of the entire factory.
    At present, some enterprise leaders still have annoyance towards backward units and backward masses and are unwilling to do their work. In fact, although there is often an advanced, intermediate, and backward situation in enterprises, each specific unit and specific person is not necessarily always advanced, intermediate, or backward. As long as enterprise leaders do not look at problems mechanically and immutably, and work sincerely with the backward masses, the backward can become advanced. Hasn't this situation been common in the past? Moreover, many units and masses are backward because the leaders' work is not in-depth and there are shortcomings in their work. If the leadership methods and leadership style are improved, their work will also be greatly changed.
    Grasping the two ends to lead the middle is a good leadership method. May the experience of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory be widely disseminated and bear fruit in more enterprises.

    抓两头带中间
    万向辛
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂领导人员在生产大跃进中，成功地实行了“两条龙”的领导方法。这种领导方法既贯彻了种试验田的精神，又提供了新的经验：抓两头带中间。
    无论什么时候，在所有企业中，总有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人，总有比较先进的单位、中间水平的单位和落后的单位。从这一客观情况出发，不断地推动广大群众赶上和突破旧有的先进水平，就可以不断地提高企业的生产和工作。要作到这一点，最好的办法就是抓两头——先进的和落后的来带动中间状态的。
    抓先进，已经是许多企业领导人员所熟知的领导方法了。抓住先进单位或先进人物，树立旗帜，总结和推广他们的经验，对生产和工作的推动作用是十分明显的。无疑地，这种领导方法需要继续坚持和推广。但是，仅仅抓先进是不是就够了呢？许多企业的经验证明：仅是抓先进，往往还不能把落后的群众发动起来，往往不能彻底改变落后单位的面貌。就是中间状态的群众，有一部分人也会满足于“比上不足，比下有余”，或者强调客观条件不如先进单位，而仍旧裹足不前。如果把抓先进和抓落后结合起来，切实去发动落后群众，那末就不仅可以消灭落后的“死角”（这是工作深入的重要标志），而且可以彻底打破“条件论”，推动全体职工共同跃进。
    在生产大跃进中抓落后单位，还是个突破薄弱环节的问题。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂就因为抓紧解决了薄弱车间——翻砂车间的一些影响全厂生产的关键问题，使其他车间解除了后顾之忧，都敢于提出大跃进的指标，因而推动了全厂的大跃进。
    目前，有些企业的领导人员对落后单位和落后群众还有厌烦情绪，不愿意去作他们的工作。实际上，在企业中虽然经常存在着先进、中间和落后的局面，但是，各个具体单位、具体人却不一定永远是先进、中间或落后的。只要企业领导人员不是机械地、一成不变地看问题，对落后群众推心置腹地进行工作，落后的就可能成为先进的。这种情况过去不是已经屡见不鲜了吗？况且，不少单位和群众之所以落后，还是领导人员工作不深入、工作中有缺点所造成的。领导方法、领导作风改进了，他们的工作也将会大为改观。
    抓两头带中间是良好的领导方法。愿哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的经验广泛传播开去，在更多的企业中开花结果。
