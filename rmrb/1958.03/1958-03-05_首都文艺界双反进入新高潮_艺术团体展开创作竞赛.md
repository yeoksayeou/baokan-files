    The "Double-Anti" Campaign Enters New Climax in Beijing's Literary and Art Circles; Art Troupes Launch Creative Competition

    (Our report) The Beijing Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department convened a city-wide conference of cultural and art workers at the Capital Theater on the 3rd, pushing the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Beijing's literary and art circles to a new climax.

    Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, called on the cultural and artistic circles at the meeting to catch up at full speed. He emphasized the need to adhere to the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," and to implement the mass line method to promote creative prosperity.

    During the conference, the China Peking Opera Theater entered the venue carrying flags and umbrellas, beating drums and gongs, reporting to the conference the good news that they would organize, adapt, and create 300 Peking Opera scripts this year, and launching a friendly challenge to brother opera troupes across the country. At that time, Ma Lianliang of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe and Zhao Yanxia of the Yanming Peking Opera Troupe enthusiastically responded, expressing their determination to catch up. The Beijing People's Art Theater also announced through Shu Xiuwen the news of increasing the number of performances, creating a large number of scripts, and streamlining personnel, to challenge brother theaters across the country.
