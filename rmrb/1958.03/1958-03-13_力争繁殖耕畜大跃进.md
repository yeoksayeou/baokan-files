Agricultural cooperativization has created a foundation for a great leap forward in agricultural production and has also created very favorable conditions for breeding draught animals. The Shuangxi Agricultural Cooperative in Jingmen County, Hubei Province, with less than a hundred water buffaloes, bred 201 calves in three years. The Xinjian Agricultural Cooperative in Dongliu County, Anhui Province, with less than ninety water buffaloes, bred 138 calves in two years.

However, on a national scale, the breeding of draught animals is not satisfactory. In 1956, the total number of draught animals in the country did not increase, and in 1957 it decreased by more than 1.6 million. Our country already has an insufficient number of draught animals, which makes the situation even more difficult. In Jilin Province in 1957, the sown area decreased by 2.4 million mu compared to 1956, and although there were many reasons for this, the main reason was insufficient animal power.

Now, the high tide of agricultural production in our country is continuing to develop. The irrigated area and the use of fertilizer have greatly increased, which requires more and stronger livestock to turn waterwheels, carry soil and fertilizer, cultivate the land intensively and meticulously, and expand the multiple cropping area. Therefore, the issue of breeding draught animals has become an urgent problem in the great leap forward in agriculture.

Some people believe that our country is going to implement agricultural mechanization, and the shortage of draught animals can be supplemented by machines, so why worry? It should be affirmed that our country will implement agricultural mechanization. However, the development speed of mechanization and the use of animal power after mechanization should also be specifically analyzed. In 1957, the national machine-cultivated area was 46 million mu, accounting for 2.7% of the cultivated area. It is estimated that by 1962, the machine-cultivated area may reach 10%. The Third Five-Year Plan will also increase significantly, but it will be difficult to fully realize machine cultivation. Heilongjiang Province is the region with the fastest development of machine cultivation in our country, and now the machine-cultivated area only accounts for 10%. Their plan is to realize mechanization within five years, but they can only develop the machine-cultivated area to 70%. That is to say, within a considerable period in the future, draught animals will still be the main power for agricultural production throughout the country. Especially in the most recent years, the need for draught animals will continue to increase. The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Liuhan Township, Yongnian County, Hebei Province, has already implemented machine cultivation. After machine cultivation, the cooperative expanded the multiple cropping area, finely harrowed the land, developed water conservancy, applied more fertilizer, and the original animal power was still not enough. Obviously, the idea that the problem of draught animals will be solved automatically after mechanization is not realistic.

Some people believe that breeding is not possible in the plain farming areas and must rely on adjustments from other places, which is also incorrect. Regional adjustments of draught animals are necessary. In the history of our country, several draught animal producing areas have been formed, and a certain number of draught animals are exported every year. However, adjustments can only be used as a supplement, and the main part still needs to be bred locally. Some people say that there is not enough feed in the plain farming areas, and breeding is not possible; in fact, there are also sufficient crop straws and a large amount of wild grass that can be used as feed. If we pay attention to promoting the silage of corn stalks and making silage feed, the potential of feed is endless.

As for whether self-breeding is cost-effective, it depends on whether your accounts are comprehensive or not. The Daxing Cooperative in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, calculated these three accounts last year. The first account is a comparison of agricultural and animal husbandry income: breeding a foal to the age of two when it can be harnessed is worth at least 300 yuan, which is equal to the output of more than 30 mu of land. The second account is a comparison between self-breeding and buying from outside: if you don't breed yourself, you have to reduce the income of the cooperative members by spending 300 yuan to buy a draught animal. The third account is about more foals and more income: the 16th production team of the cooperative produced five foals and four calves in 1957, and after raising them for two years, they can earn at least 2,400 yuan; the 15th team has seven mares that can breed, but not a single foal was born, which is equivalent to throwing away more than 220 mu of crops for nothing. After calculating the accounts, the cooperative members all recognized the significance of breeding draught animals, so that all the mares in the cooperative were mated in 1957, and most of the cattle and donkeys were also mated. It is estimated that more than 230 horses, cattle, and donkeys can be bred this spring.

Are there conditions for breeding a large number of draught animals in a short period of time? It should be said that the conditions are available. As long as we subjectively exert our efforts and strive for progress, it is entirely possible. First, we have a large number of breeding females. According to statistics, among the more than 84 million large livestock, there are 26.8 million breeding females, accounting for one-third of the total number of livestock. If an average of 50 young livestock are born per hundred breeding females each year, 13.4 million young livestock can be supplemented in one year. Second, most agricultural cooperatives have had two years of cooperative history, and they have already explored a set of experiences in raising and breeding livestock under the cooperative economy. The equipment of the livestock sheds has also been enriched, and the condition of the livestock is much better than at this time last year and the year before. The enhancement of the condition of the livestock is the basis for mating. Third, after extensive airing of views and debates, everyone has realized the importance of breeding draught animals, and the masses are very active. Estimating these favorable conditions, we should have full confidence in striving for a victory in the work of breeding draught animals in 1958.

Now is the time for livestock mating. We must seize the opportunity and designate March and April as intensive mating months to launch a mating campaign. Each agricultural cooperative must formulate a mating plan and equip enough breeding males according to the number of breeding females. If there are not enough breeding males, they can be borrowed or exchanged for breeding livestock from government agencies and military units, or purchased from state-owned breeding farms. At the same time, we must comprehensively arrange animal power, earnestly solve the contradiction between service and breeding, and ensure that mating and service are not delayed.

According to the characteristics of the cooperative economy, agricultural cooperatives should formulate a system and methods for rewarding the breeding of draught animals. According to the experience of various places, agricultural cooperatives can generally stipulate quotas for breeding and mating females and reward those who exceed the quotas.

If livestock are raised by individual households, the young livestock born can be valued and returned to the cooperative after they have grown to a certain period, and the cooperative and the feeding households will share the proceeds proportionally, so that those who breed will benefit.

### 力争繁殖耕畜大跃进

    力争繁殖耕畜大跃进
    农业合作化创立了农业生产大跃进的基础，同时也给繁殖耕畜创造了十分有利的条件。湖北荆门县双喜农业社不到百头水田牛，三年内繁殖小牛二百零一头。安徽东流县新建农业社不到九十头水田牛，二年内繁殖小牛一百三十八头。
    但是就全国来讲，耕畜繁殖工作是不能令人满意的。1956年全国耕畜总数没有增加，1957年还减少了一百六十多万头。我国耕畜本来不足，这一来就更困难了。吉林省1957年播种面积比1956年减少二百四十万亩，虽然原因很多，但主要是畜力不足。
    现在，我国农业生产的高潮正在继续发展，耕地灌溉面积和肥料都大大增加了，这就需要更多更壮的牲畜来转车提水，拉土送粪，精耕细作，扩大复种面积。因此繁殖耕畜的问题就成为农业大跃进中的迫切问题。
    有些人认为，我们国家要实行农业机械化了，耕畜不足可以用机器来补充，何必着急？应该肯定，我国是要实行农业机械化的。但是对于机械化的发展速度以及机械化以后使用畜力的情况也要进行具体的分析。1957年全国的机耕面积是四千六百万亩，占耕地面积2.7％。预计到1962年，机耕面积可能达到10％。第三个五年计划还会大量增加，但也难于全部实现机耕。黑龙江省是我国机耕面积发展最快的地区，现在机耕面积也只占10％。他们计划在五年内实现机械化，也只能把机耕面积发展到70％。这就是说，在全国范围内，今后一个相当长的时期耕畜仍将是农业生产的主要动力。特别是在最近几年内，耕畜的需要将不断增加。河北省永年县刘汗乡五一农业社已经实行机耕，机耕以后该社扩大了复种面积，细耙整地，开展水利，多施肥，原有的畜力仍然不够用。显然，认为机械化之后耕畜问题就会自行解决的想法是不现实的。
    有些人认为平原农区不能繁殖，必须依赖外地调剂，这也是不正确的。耕畜的地区调剂是必要的，我国历史上也已形成了若干个耕畜产地，每年都向外流出一定数量的耕畜。但是调剂只能作为补充，主要的部分还需要由本地繁殖。有人说平原农区饲草不足，不能繁殖；其实那里也有充足的农作物秸秆和大量的野草可作饲料。如果注意推广玉米秸秆青贮，做青贮饲料，饲草的潜力是无穷无尽的。
    至于自己繁殖究竟是否合算，那要看你账算的全面不全面。辽宁省昌图县大兴社去年算了这样三笔账。第一笔是农畜业收入对比账：繁殖一头马驹到二年上套以后最低可值三百元，等于三十多亩地的产量。第二笔是自己繁殖同向外购买对比的账：如果自己不繁殖，用三百元买一头耕畜，就要减少社员收入。第三笔是多产驹、多收入的账：该社第十六生产队1957年产五头马驹，四头牛犊，养二年后最低能收入二千四百元；第十五队有七匹可以繁殖的母马而一头驹也未下，等于白白地扔掉了二百二十多亩地的庄稼。经过算账，社员们都认识了繁殖耕畜的意义，从而使该社母马在1957年全部配了种，牛、驴也大部配了种，估计今年春天可以繁殖马、牛、驴二百三十多头。
    有没有条件在短期内繁殖大量耕畜呢？应该说条件是具备的。只要主观上拿出干劲，力争上游，就完全可以办到。第一，我们有大批的可以繁殖的母畜。据统计，在八千四百多万头大牲畜中，有能繁殖的母畜二千六百八十万头，占畜群总数的三分之一。如果平均每年每百头母畜生五十头幼畜，一年就可以补充幼畜一千三百四十万头。第二，大多数农业社已有两年办社历史，他们已经摸索出一套在合作经济下的喂养繁殖牲畜的经验，畜舍的设备也充实起来了，畜膘比去年及前年这个时候是好的多了。畜膘的增强，就是配种的基础。第三，经过大鸣、大争，大家都认识到了繁殖耕畜的重要性，群众都很积极。估计到这些有利的条件，我们就应当信心百倍地争取1958年在繁殖耕畜的工作上打一个胜仗。
    现在马上就到了牲畜配种的时候了。我们必须抓紧时机，把三、四月定为配种突击月，开展一个配种运动。每个农业社都要制订配种计划，根据可繁殖的母畜头数配备足够的种公畜。种公畜不够的，可以借用或换用机关部队牲畜中的种畜，或向国营种畜场购买。同时要统筹安排畜力，认真解决使役和繁殖之间的矛盾，作到配种和使役两不误。
    根据合作经济的特点，农业社应该制定奖励繁殖耕畜的制度和办法。根据各地经验，农业社一般可以规定母畜配种繁殖定额，超额奖励。
    凡牲畜分户喂养的，所生幼畜在长到一定时期以后可以作价归社，由社与饲养户比例分成，使繁殖的人有利可得。
