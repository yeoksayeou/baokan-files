Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, March 3rd: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation led by Marshal Ye Jianying concluded its visit to India and left Calcutta this morning aboard a special Indian Air Force plane to return home.

The delegation was invited by the Indian government to visit. During their forty-day visit to India, they visited several major cities, training facilities of the Indian Defense Forces, military schools and colleges, military bases, some industrial institutions, and water conservancy projects.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 3rd: All India Radio broadcasted on March 3rd the radio address to the Indian people by Marshal Ye Jianying, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation. His speech was recorded by All India Radio on February 27th, on the eve of his departure from India. In his speech, he emphasized the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indian people.

Ye Jianying said: "The friendship between the Chinese and Indian people has a long history. For thousands of years, our two peoples have never harbored hatred or animosity towards each other; instead, we have records of cultural and economic exchanges and friendly coexistence." He said that although the obstacles created by colonialism in the past one or two centuries prevented the friendship between the two countries from developing as it should, the two peoples still overcame difficulties and provided each other with sympathy and support through various means. He said that he would not forget that the Indian people sent an Indian Medical Mission to China during the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan to provide assistance to the Chinese people.

Ye Jianying said that in recent years, after China and India shook off the oppression of colonialism and achieved their respective independence, the traditional friendship between the two countries has developed substantially. He said, "Our two peoples are very pleased to see that our two countries' leaders have advocated the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence—Panchsheel—which not only establishes a solid political foundation for the friendship between our two countries but also creates a brilliant example for relations between countries in the world. Now, our two countries are actively engaged in large-scale economic construction, and we also need to learn from each other and help each other."

Ye Jianying said that just like the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, the armed forces of the two countries are also friendly. He said, "Our tasks are to defend the peaceful construction of our motherlands and to safeguard world peace. Therefore, not only were we close comrades-in-arms in the past war against fascist aggression, but in the future, we will also work together to safeguard world peace." He said he believed that the friendship between the Chinese and Indian armies will continue and surpass our predecessors, setting an even more brilliant example.

He said that during this visit, the delegation saw many strengths and advantages of the Indian army; in the sincere conversations with Indian armed forces officers, they also gained many insights. Therefore, he once again expressed his most heartfelt thanks to all Indian friends who met, spoke with, and received the delegation.

Ye Jianying concluded, "We firmly believe that the friendly exchanges between the people, armies, and governments of China and India will become more frequent in the future, and our friendship, like the Ganges and the Yangtze River in our two countries, will be long-lasting and flow eternally."

    中印友谊像恒河和扬子江长流不息
    叶剑英元帅离开新德里前对印度人民广播
    据新华社加尔各答3日电  叶剑英元帅率领的中国军事友好代表团在印度结束访问以后，今天上午乘印度空军专机离开加尔各答回国。
    代表团是应印度政府的邀请来访问的。他们在印度访问的四十天中，参观访问了几个大城市、印度国防部队的训练设施、军事学校和学院、军事基地、一些工业机构和水利工程等。
    据新华社新德里3日电全印广播电台3日广播了中国军事友好代表团团长叶剑英元帅对印度人民的广播讲话。他的讲话是在他离开印度回国前夕，2月27日由全印广播电台录音的。他在讲话中强调了中印两国人民的传统友谊。
    叶剑英说：“中印两国人民的友谊是有着悠久历史的，几千年来，我们两国人民从来没有相互仇恨，相互敌对的痕迹；我们却有文化上、经济上的相互来往，友好相处的记录。”他说，近一、二百年来，虽然由于殖民主义所造成的障碍，使两国之间的友谊没有能够得到应有的发展，但是两国人民还是排除困难，通过各种办法，互相给予同情和支持。他说，他也不会忘记，印度人民在中国抗战期间，派遣了印度援华医疗队来到中国，给予中国人民的援助。
    叶剑英说，近年来，当中印两国摆脱了殖民主义的压迫，先后取得了各自的独立之后，两国之间的传统友谊又得到了长足的发展。他说，“我们两国人民十分高兴的看到，我们两国领导人倡导了著名的和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉，不仅为我们两国的友谊树立了巩固的政治基础，同时也为世界上国与国之间的关系创造了光辉的范例。现在，我们两国都正在积极地进行着规模宏大的经济建设工作，我们也需要互相学习，互相帮助。”
    叶剑英说，正同中印两国人民之间的友谊一样，两国的武装部队之间也是友好的。他说，“我们的任务都是保卫祖国的和平建设和保卫世界和平。因此，不仅在过去反对法西斯侵略战争中我们曾经是亲密的战友，而且在今后为了保卫世界和平，我们也将共同努力。”他说，他相信，中印两国军队之间的友谊，一定会继续。而且超过我们的先辈，做出更加光辉的榜样。
    他说，代表团在这次访问中，看到了印度军队的许多优点和长处；在同印度武装部队军官们的恳挚交谈中，也得到了许多教益。因此，他再一次向所有曾经同代表团会见、交谈和接待过代表团的一切印度朋友，表示最衷心的谢意。
    叶剑英最后说，“我们坚决相信，中印两国人民、军队和政府之间的友好来往，今后必将更加频繁，我们之间的友谊，就像我们两国的恒河和扬子江一样，源远、流长，长流不息。”
