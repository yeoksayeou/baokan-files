    Shanghai's Spring
    Jin Yi

    It was during this extraordinary, galloping, rapidly changing spring that I arrived at the Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill.

    The State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill is in Putuo District, and anyone who has been to Shanghai knows that it is a factory area. I used to visit young workers here; but in the spring of 1958, when I got off the No. 24 trolleybus, the scene before me was dazzling. I stood in front of the tall tower of the Big Ben clock and couldn't cross the pedestrian crossing for a long time; because from south to north, from east to west, there was a constant stream of floats reporting good news and challenging each other, and teams waving red flags, with gongs and drums sounding in unison. There were also quiet and orderly lines of workers going to brother factories for visits and study.

    Upon entering the factory gate, both sides were covered with colorful pledges and big-character posters. In front of the office building, I saw a bulletin from the Southern Weaving Workshop: it stated that in response to the call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with and surpass the level of Great Britain in fifteen years, the "2321" shirting fabric with high strength and warp and weft density woven on key machines in one week had caught up with the Japanese "2523" fabric. And with the revolutionary spirit of riding the wind and waves, they guaranteed to basically mass-produce at the end of the first quarter, completely catching up with the Japanese level! They not only reported the good news to the leadership and the entire factory with excitement, but also specifically wrote out the percentage of cotton cleanness and impurities, and the tensile kilograms of warp strength and weft strength of the shirting fabric produced by the factory and Japan, so that everyone could see at a glance how much stronger it was than Japan, and where it was better; and fearing that it was not clear enough, they pasted three pieces of cloth samples below: one was from before, one was the recent one that caught up with Japan, and the other was from Japan. They also did not hide the difficulties and existing problems: such as "fuzzy edges," "weft shedding," "leakage rate"... But then they proposed methods to overcome the above difficulties and shortcomings with heroic spirit and unparalleled confidence; at the same time, they also made several requests to the Southern Spinning Mill: improve evenness, reduce cotton cleanness impurities, reduce weaving mending, so that they can jointly improve the quality of the cloth and jointly catch up with the Japanese level.

    For an amateur like me, this was truly a vivid and concrete lesson. No exaggeration, no minimization, just right, everything was so practical and convincing. Although I couldn't understand some of the terms and didn't understand the content; but I knew that insiders would understand it at a glance and couldn't find any unrealistic points. In the newspapers, I have seen that Shanghai's rubber industry, bicycle manufacturing, gold pens... have also specifically proposed to catch up with and surpass the same products of capitalist countries in a few years, and put forward the existing problems, the methods to overcome the difficulties, and the direction of efforts... This is the superiority of the socialist system, the east wind will definitely prevail over the west wind, fully demonstrating the greatness of the working class. With such invincible courage, we can ride the wind and waves, and leave the capitalist countries behind in the near future.

    But what is even more exciting, and has been passed around in the mouths of the seven million people of Shanghai, is that Shanghai workers responded to the call of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to strive to accumulate 1 billion yuan more funds for the motherland in 1958.

    I, who have never had a very clear concept of numbers, was not surprised when I first saw this great news. I couldn't even say how many circles it takes to make a billion; but when I drew ten billion with a pen and distributed it to Shanghai's one million industrial workers, I was really shocked! Each worker has to accumulate one thousand yuan a year—that is to say, each person has to accumulate three yuan a day. This is not a small amount. Taking the workers of the State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill as an example, they must increase production by a quarter to complete this great task. Therefore, a big fire must first be used to burn away all waste and conservative ideas, in order to muster up energy, whip the horse and speed up, break through conventions, and leap forward.

    Our country's working class is advancing bravely and taking the lead; more than five hundred million peasant brothers and sisters are also shouting loudly: "Mountains are hard but not harder than determination, mountains are high but not higher than the soles of our feet," "Water flows five zhang above the plain, rice fields fly up the mountains." This spirit and ambition of swallowing mountains and rivers will not only surpass the achievements of thousands of years of history, but also change the laws of nature, not "the water of the Yellow River comes from the sky," but "the water of the high mountains comes down to the ground." Our soldiers, the good children of the Chinese people, immediately want to support 30 million working days in one year with the momentum of thousands of troops and horses.

    The people of our motherland have thus boiled up, the earth is shaking, and the mountains and rivers are changing color; what is placed in front of our literary workers is no longer a question of deep thought, but a question of action, a question of catching up immediately. We must exert all our strength and run forward so as not to fall behind the 600 million people, so as not to fall behind the great reality.

### 上海的春天

    上海的春天
    靳以
    就是在这不平常的、万马奔腾、瞬息万千的春天，我到了上海的国棉一厂。
    国棉一厂在普陀区，凡是到过上海的人，都知道那是一个工厂区。过去我曾经来访问过青年工人；可是在1958年的春天，我走下了二十四路无轨电车，眼前的景象简直使我眼花缭乱。我站在大自鸣钟的高塔前，好久穿不过人行道；因为从南到北，从东到西，不断地穿行着报喜的和互相挑战的彩车和飘着红旗的队伍，锣鼓声响成了一片。还有安静整齐的行列，那是到兄弟厂参观学习的工人同志们。
    进了厂门，左右贴满了五颜六色的保证书和大字报。在办公楼前我看到一张南织车间的喜报：那上面写出为了响应党中央号召十五年赶上和超过英国的水平，一星期中，在重点机上织出的“二三二一”市布强力和经纬密度已经赶上了日本的“二五二三”布。并且要以乘长风破万里浪的革命干劲，保证在一季度末基本大量生产，全部赶上日本水平！他们不仅以兴奋的心情向领导和全厂报喜，而且具体地写出来一厂和日本生产的市布的棉洁和杂质的百分比，经强和纬强的拉力公斤数，让每个人一眼就看到比日本强多少，好在什么地方；还怕说不清楚，下面贴了三方布样：一方是从前的，一方是最近赶上日本的，还有一方就是日本的。他们也不隐瞒困难和存在的问题：如同“毛边”，“脱纬”，“漏验率”……但是接着就以豪迈的气概，无比的信心提出能够克服以上困难和缺点的办法；同时并向南纺纱厂提出几点要求：改善条干，减低棉洁杂质，减少纱厂织补，让他们共同提高布的质量，共同赶上日本水平。
    对于我这么一个外行来说，这真是生动而具体的一课。不夸张，不缩小，恰如其分，一切是那么实际，有充分的说服力。尽管我有些名词还看不懂，内容也不了解；可是我知道内行人会一目了然，找不出一点不踏实的地方。在报纸上，我曾看见上海的橡胶工业，自行车制造，金笔……也都具体地提出了几年赶上和超过资本主义国家的同样产品，并提出了存在的问题，克服困难的办法，努力的方向……这就是社会主义制度的优越性，东风一定压倒西风，充分地显示了工人阶级的伟大。有了这样无坚不克的勇气，才能乘风破浪，不久的将来把资本主义国家丢在后边。
    但更使人激动的，在上海七百万人民口中传诵一时的，是上海工人同志响应市工联的号召，争取在1958年为祖国多积累十亿元资金。
    对于数目字一向没有十分明确观念的我，最初看到这个伟大的消息并不觉得惊异。一下子我都说不出来几个圈圈才算得上是亿；可是当我用笔画出来十亿，分配给上海一百万产业工人，就使我着实一惊！每个工人一年内要积累一千元——也就是说每人每天要积累三元。这不是一个小数目，就以国棉一厂的工人同志来说，必须把生产提高四分之一，才能完成这个伟大的任务。因此必须先用一把大火烧掉一切浪费和保守思想，才能鼓足干劲，快马加鞭，冲破成规，飞跃前进。
    我们祖国的工人阶级勇往直前，一马当先；五亿以上的农民弟兄也高声叫出来：“山硬硬不过决心，山高高不过脚心”，“水上五丈原，稻田飞上山”，这气吞山河的气魄和雄心，不但要盖过几千年历史上的成就，而且要改变自然规律，不是“黄河之水天上来”，而是“高山之水地下来”。我们的战士，中国人民的好子弟兵，立刻以千军万马之势要在一年中支援三千万个劳动日。
    我们祖国的人民就是这样沸腾起来了，大地都在抖动，山川都为之变色；摆在我们文学工作者面前的已经不是深思的问题，是行动的问题，是立即赶上去的问题。我们必须使出全身的力气，飞奔向前，才能不落在六亿人民的后边，才能不落在伟大现实的后边。
