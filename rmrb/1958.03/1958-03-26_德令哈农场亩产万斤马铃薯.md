Agricultural High Yield Aspiration

    Delingha Farm
    10,000 Jin Potato Yield Per Mu
    The Third Production Team of the Third Work Station of Delingha Farm in Qinghai Province had ten mu of high-yield potatoes in 1957, with an average yield of 11,242 jin per mu. Based on available materials, this is the first record in the country of achieving such a high yield on an area of ten mu.
    They selected excellent local potato varieties. Vernalization treatment was carried out before sowing, which generally increases yield by about 20%. Based on the characteristics of potatoes requiring a large amount of potassium and nitrogen fertilizer during the development stage, sufficient topdressing was applied after cultivation. In addition, dense planting was also implemented. The farm's field potatoes were originally planted with 3,600 plants per mu. Last year, they learned from the advanced experience of the Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative in Beijing and increased the number of plants per mu to 7,200 in the high-yield area. These measures are important factors in achieving high yields.

    德令哈农场
    亩产万斤马铃薯
    青海省德令哈农场第三作业站第三生产队，1957年有十亩丰产马铃薯，每亩平均产一万一千二百四十二斤。从现有的材料看，这是全国第一个在十亩面积上得到这样高产量的纪录。
    他们选择的是当地优良薯种。播种前进行了春化处理，一般可提高产量20％左右。根据马铃薯发育阶段需要大量钾、氮肥的特点，在中耕后施了足够的追肥。此外，还实行了密植，这个场的大田马铃薯，原来每亩种植三千六百株，去年学习了北京市黄土岗农业社的先进经验，在丰产区将每亩植株增加到七千二百株。这些措施都是获得高额丰产的重要因素。
