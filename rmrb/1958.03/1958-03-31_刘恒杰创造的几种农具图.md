    Illustrations of Several Agricultural Tools Created by Liu Hengjie
    Cotton Stalk Pulling Plow
    In cotton planting areas, farmers use iron hooks and carrying poles to pull up cotton stalks. When the weather is dry and the ground is hard, it is very laborious, and they can only pull up a little over two mu per day. Using this plow is much more efficient. A single draft animal can plow more than fifteen mu per day.
    Waterwheel Return Lever
    In well-irrigated areas, if farmers attach a return lever to the pull rod of the waterwheel, it will be much easier whether pulled by animals or pushed by people. In the past, a waterwheel required four people to push, but with the return lever, only two people are needed.
    Double-Headed Hoe
    The usual wheat hoe has only one head, and one person can only hoe two mu of wheat per day. Using this hoe can double labor efficiency.
    Ditch Digging Plow
    For earthing up or irrigating the roots of corn and cotton, people used to use a planer with a beam or a plow with a rush beam, which was very laborious and strained the animals, and easily damaged the field seedlings. Sometimes, the low efficiency delayed the timely ditch digging. Using a ditch digging plow to plane furrows can not only overcome the above difficulties, but also is very efficient. A single draft animal can plow more than twenty mu per day. Oblique-tooth Harrow For crops with wide row spacing such as corn and cotton, during the mid-cultivation period, after irrigation or after the ground is hardened by heavy rain, use this harrow to rake along the rows. A single draft animal can harrow more than twenty mu per day, which can loosen the soil and remove weeds.
    Beam Attachment
    The beam attachment is specially for planing furrows in wheat fields. A single draft animal can add beams to thirty to fifty mu per day, which saves labor and does not affect irrigation. (Originally published in Shaanxi Daily) (Attached pictures)

    刘恒杰创造的几种农具图
    拔棉花秆犁
    植棉区农民拔花秆用的是铁钩和抬杆，遇见天旱地干很费力，一天只拔二亩多，用这犁效率很高，套一犋单套牲口一天能犁十五亩多。
    水车回头拉杆
    井灌区农民如果在水车的拉杆上，钉上一个回头拉杆，不论牲口曳或人推都很省力气。过去需要四个人推的水车，使上水车回头拉杆两个人就行了。
    双头锄
    通常的锄麦锄是一个头，一个人一天只锄二亩麦，用这锄劳动效率可提高一倍。
    开沟犁
    给玉米、棉花根部培土或浇灌，往常用刨耙加梁或用犁冲梁，很费劳力和畜力，又容易伤坏田苗，有时因效率低还耽误合墒开沟时间。若用开沟犁刨畦子，不但可以克服上述困难，而且效率很高，一天一犋单套牲口可犁二十多亩。斜齿行子耙玉米、棉花等行距较宽的作物，中耕期间浇灌后，或暴雨后地面板结，用这耙顺行耙去，一天一犋单套牲口可耙二十多亩，可以起松土、除草的作用。
    加梁器
    加梁器专供麦田刨畦子用，套一犋单套牲口一天可加三十亩到五十亩，既省劳力又不影响灌溉。    （原载陕西日报）（附图片）
