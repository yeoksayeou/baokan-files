    The Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is Finally Signed

    The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the memorandum, which is an integral part of the agreement, were signed yesterday in Beijing by representatives of both China and Japan. This is a major event in the development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic exchange. We express our warm welcome.

    The negotiations on the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japanese delegation for trade promotion, composed of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Japan-China Export-Import Association, began as early as September last year. During more than forty days of discussions, both sides consulted on various issues related to promoting trade and further developing economic exchanges between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and discussed the draft of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement proposed by the Chinese side. The Chinese side had tried its best to adopt the opinions of the Japanese side and made as many concessions as possible on issues such as commodity classification, payment methods, and commodity inspection, thus facilitating the agreement between the two sides on the draft agreement. At the same time, both sides unanimously agreed to make a memorandum on the relevant matters of establishing permanent private commercial representative offices mutually, as an integral part of the agreement. At that time, the Japanese side expressed that some issues regarding the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices in the memorandum needed to be discussed back in Japan, and suggested a recess, so the negotiations were interrupted. The Chinese side fully understood the difficulties of the Japanese side, and therefore agreed to the suggestion of the Japanese side. There is no doubt that the vast majority of the Japanese people fervently hoped for the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the mutual establishment of permanent commercial representative offices. However, forces unwilling to see Sino-Japanese friendship tried to undermine the realization of this common wish of the people of both countries, which could not but increase the difficulties of the Japanese side, and these difficulties should not have occurred in the first place.

    We are pleased to see that the broad masses of the Japanese people have launched a nationwide signature campaign to promote the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement; more than 250 Japanese economic organizations held a conference and passed a resolution, warmly demanding the early conclusion of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement; many Japanese industrialists and economists with insight into the current Japanese and world economy also warmly hoped that this agreement could be signed as soon as possible; at the same time, the Japanese representatives who participated in the Sino-Japanese trade negotiations also made many efforts after returning to their country. This time, the Japanese trade mission came to our country again, and on the basis of the agreement reached last year, the two sides finally signed the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. This proves that as long as the people of our two countries persist in their efforts, the development of Sino-Japanese trade and Sino-Japanese friendship cannot be stopped by any force.

    The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement should have been signed long ago. The state of having no agreement is always unfavorable to the development of trade between the two countries. According to materials published by the Japanese side, the total trade volume between China and Japan in 1957 decreased compared with 1956. In the past, the Chinese side made many efforts to eliminate this adverse effect. Not long ago, the China National Minerals Corporation and the China National Metals & Minerals Import & Export Corporation signed a long-term barter agreement and a 1958 barter protocol with the Japanese steel delegation, which is a good example. Now with the new trade agreement, not only can it better guarantee the smooth implementation of such individual agreements, but it will also promote a new development in Sino-Japanese trade.

    The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement stipulates that the total amount of exports and imports by each party is 35 million pounds, which is a considerable increase compared with the third agreement. The agreement also changes the commodity classification from the past three categories to two categories; the agreement also stipulates that before the signing of a payment agreement between the two countries' national banks, the foreign exchange banks of the two countries should establish direct business relations; these are all conducive to expanding transactions. In particular, the new agreement and memorandum have made practical and clear provisions on the relevant matters of establishing permanent private commercial representative offices mutually. The mutual dispatch of permanent commercial representative offices is a long-term wish of the people and economic circles of China and Japan. The realization of this wish will not only have a positive impact on promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, but also play a great role in both sides understanding the relevant trade situation and market situation, assisting manufacturers of both countries in carrying out transaction activities, and promoting economic and technological exchanges between the two countries. With the realization of the mutual dispatch of permanent commercial representative offices, we can fully expect that the development of Sino-Japanese trade will enter a new stage.

    We hope that after the signing of the new agreement, both parties will actively and responsibly implement the various provisions in the agreement, so that the agreement can be fulfilled satisfactorily. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that it is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of the parties signing the agreement and the people of the two countries; the governments of both parties should also take an active and responsible attitude and take effective measures to support and assist them. Only in this way can the agreement be fulfilled satisfactorily.

    China and Japan are neighbors located close to each other, and trade relations have a long history. Developing trade between the two countries is beneficial to the economic development of both countries. China is now starting its second five-year plan and needs a large amount of construction materials. The economic problem currently facing Japan is the accumulation of products, and industrial sectors such as steel, non-ferrous metals, and textiles have implemented production cuts one after another. In connection with the overall economic recession in the capitalist world, the importance and urgency of developing trade between China and Japan for the Japanese economy is even more obvious. Japanese steel manufacturers believe that the trade agreement between China and Japan on steel has "a feeling of resurrection" for the Japanese steel industry in a period of depression, which can fully illustrate this point. In short, from the aspects of geography, history, resources, production conditions, etc., China and Japan have what the other needs, and it is inevitable and natural to develop trade exchanges. This is an inevitable trend determined by the objective requirements of the economic development of the two countries. It can never be blocked by measures such as "embargoes" and other artificial obstacles. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, after some twists and turns, was finally signed, which proves this point. In the face of objective situations, we should comply with it and make it conducive to the economic development of the two countries; we should not hinder it, and only get the result of "drawing a knife to cut water, but the water flows on." We sincerely hope that the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement will bring greater development to trade exchanges and economic exchanges between China and Japan.

### 中日贸易协定终于签字了

    中日贸易协定终于签字了
    第四次中日贸易协定和作为协定不可分割的一部分的备忘录，已于昨天在北京由中日双方代表签字。这是中日贸易发展和经济交流上的一件大事。我们表示热烈欢迎。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会同日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本国际贸易促进协会和日本日中输出入组合所组成的日本访华通商使节团关于第四次中日贸易协定的谈判早在去年9月就已开始进行。在四十多天的商谈中，双方在平等互利的基础上，就有关促进两国贸易和进一步发展经济交流的各项问题进行了协商，并就中国方面所建议的第四次中日贸易协定草案进行了讨论。中国方面曾经在商品分类、支付办法、商品检验等不少问题上尽量采纳了日本方面的意见，作了尽可能的让步，因而促成了双方就协定草案一致达成协议。同时，双方一致同意将互设常驻的民间商务代表机构的有关事项制成备忘录，作为协定不可分割的一部分。当时由于日本方面表示关于备忘录里的互设商务代表机构的某些问题，还需要回国进行商讨，建议休会，因而谈判才告中断。中国方面完全了解日本方面的困难，因而同意了日本方面的建议。毫无疑问，日本人民是热烈希望签订第四次中日贸易协定和互设常驻商务代表机构的。但是不愿意中日友好的势力却力图破坏这一中日两国人民的共同愿望的实现，这就不能不增加日本方面的困难，而这些困难是本来就不应该发生的。
    我们高兴地看到：日本广大人民为了促进第四次中日贸易协定的签订，开展了全民性的签名运动；日本二百五十多个经济团体举行大会，通过决议，热烈要求早日缔结第四次中日贸易协定；日本许多对目前日本和世界经济有见识的实业家和经济界人士也热烈希望这次协定能够早日签订；同时，参加中日贸易谈判的日方代表归国之后也作了不少努力。这次日本通商使节团重来我国，在去年已经达成的协议的基础上，双方终于签订了第四次中日贸易协定。这就证明了，只要我们两国人民坚持努力，中日贸易和中日友谊的发展是任何力量阻挡不了的。
    第四次中日贸易协定本来早就应该签订了。无协定的空白状态，对于两国间的贸易发展总是不利的。据日本方面发表的材料，1957年中日双方的贸易总额比1956年就减少了。中国方面过去为了消除这种不利影响，曾作了许多努力。不久以前，中国矿产公司和五金公司同日本钢铁代表团签订了长期易货协议和1958年易货议定书，就是一个很好的例子。现在有了新的贸易协定，不仅更能保证顺利执行这样个别的协议，而且会促使中日贸易有一个新的发展。
    第四次中日贸易协定规定每方输出和输入的总额各为三千五百万英镑，比第三次协定已有了相当的增加。协定中关于商品分类问题，也从过去的三类改为两类；有关交易的支付和清算事宜，也规定在两国国家银行之间签订支付协定之前，由两国外汇银行建立直接业务关系；这些都是有利于扩大交易的。特别是新的协定和备忘录，对于互设常驻的民间商务代表机构的有关事项，作了切实可行的明确规定。互派常驻的商务代表机构是中日两国人民和经济界的长期愿望。这个愿望得以实现，不仅对促进中日关系的正常化会有积极影响，而且对于双方互相了解有关的贸易情况和市场情况、协助两国厂商进行交易活动、促进两国间的经济交流和技术交流等等，都会发挥很大作用。由于互派常驻商务代表机构的实现，我们完全可以期待，中日贸易的发展会进入一个新的阶段。
    我们希望：在新的协定签订之后，双方积极负责地执行协定中的各项规定，使协定能够圆满地实现。同时，还应该指出：仅仅依靠签订协定的双方和两国人民的努力是不够的，双方的政府也应该以积极负责的态度，采取有效措施，给以支持和协助，只有这样，协定才能够圆满地实现。
    中日两国地处近邻，贸易关系也有着长久的历史。发展两国之间的贸易，对于两国的经济发展都是有好处的。中国现在正在开始第二个五年计划，需要大量建设资材。日本目前面临的经济问题又是产品积压，钢铁、非铁金属、纤维等工业部门纷纷实行减产。同资本主义世界的整个经济衰退情况联系起来看，发展中日两国间的贸易，对于日本经济的重要性和迫切性就更为明显。日本钢铁厂商认为中日双方关于钢铁的贸易协议，对于处于萧条时期的日本钢铁业“真有起死回生之感”，就可以充分说明这个问题。总之，从地理、历史、资源、生产条件等等方面看，中日两国间有无相通，发展贸易往来，是势所必至，理所当然的。这是两国经济发展的客观要求所决定的必然归趋。它决不是“禁运”之类的措施和其它人为的障碍所能阻挡得了的。第四次中日贸易协定，经过一些波折之后而终于签订，就证明了这点。在客观形势面前，我们应该顺应它，使它有利于两国经济的发展；而不应阻碍它，徒然得到“抽刀断水水更流”的结果。我们衷心地希望第四次中日贸易协定一定会给中日两国间的贸易往来和经济交流带来更大的发展。
