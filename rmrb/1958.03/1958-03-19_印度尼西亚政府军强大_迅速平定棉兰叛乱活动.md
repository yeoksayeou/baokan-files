Indonesian Government Forces Powerful
Quickly Quell Medan Rebellion

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th – Jakarta newspapers reported today that rebel troops, defeated by government forces in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, have fled to Tarutung in southern North Sumatra and Aceh in the north.

These newspapers reported the details of the Medan incident, stating that on the morning of the 16th, a company of troops stationed in Tarutung, led by the rebel Bohan, marched towards Medan. After joining up with soldiers from the 131st Battalion led by the rebel Siregar, they were led by Nainggolan, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the First Military Region who had just returned from training in the United States. They arrested some senior officers and seized their authority. The officers arrested by these rebels included Lieutenant Colonel Sugiharto, the former Medan Garrison Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sukaja, Major Sukardi of the military police, and the commander of Medan Polonia Airport.

Subsequently, the rebels occupied part of the city and plotted to sabotage Polonia Airport. However, the government air force and other army units loyal to the government thwarted their plot.

Government troops stationed in Medan, in order to avoid serious bloodshed, once withdrew from the city. Later, Manaf Lubis, commander of the Second Infantry Regiment, launched an attack on the rebels. After Kyunting, commander of the First Military Region, arrived from other areas, he took over command.

Under the offensive of the government air force and army, the rebels were defeated. On the morning of the 17th, after occupying Medan for twenty-four hours, they were driven out of the city.

Medan has now returned to normal.

The Indonesian Army Headquarters announced on the evening of the 17th that eight officers of the First Military Region who participated in the Medan disturbances have been dismissed from their military posts, including Major Nainggolan, Major Siregar, and Captain Bohan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 18th – Jakarta's "People's Daily" pointed out today that the disturbances in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, were a long-planned event by the rebels Lubis and Simbolon. They launched the riots when government forces were concentrating their efforts to fight the Husaini rebel group in Central Sumatra, in order to reduce the pressure of government forces on Padang and Bukittinggi in Central Sumatra, thereby diverting people's attention and expanding the front. The newspaper said that this proves that the rebels in Central Sumatra are in a desperate situation, while the strength of the patriotic army and the people is powerful.

    印度尼西亚政府军强大
    迅速平定棉兰叛乱活动
    新华社雅加达18日电　据雅加达报纸今天报道，叛乱分子的军队在北苏门答腊首府棉兰被政府军队打败以后，已经逃到北苏门答腊南部的打板奴里和北部的亚齐。
    这些报纸详细地报道棉兰事件的经过说，在16日早上，驻在打板奴里的一连军队在叛乱分子波汉的率领下向棉兰市进发。他们在同叛乱分子西雷加尔所率领的第一百三十一营士兵会合以后，就在刚从美国受训回国的第一军区副参谋长奈恩戈兰的率领下，逮捕了一些上级军官，并且夺取了他们的权力。被这些叛乱分子逮捕的军官有前棉兰市卫戍司令苏吉哈托中校、苏卡雅中校、苏卡迪宪兵少校和棉兰浮罗岭飞机场司令等人。
    接着，叛乱分子占领了城市的一部分地区，并且阴谋破坏浮罗岭飞机场，但是，政府空军和忠于政府的其他陆军部队挫败了他们的这个阴谋。
    驻在棉兰的政府军队为了避免严重的流血冲突，曾经一度撤出城外。后来，第二步兵团团长曼纳普·卢比斯对叛乱分子发动了进攻。第一军区司令京廷斯从其他地区来到以后，接过了指挥权。
    在政府空军和陆军的攻势下，叛军被击败了，17日上午，他们在占据棉兰二十四小时以后，被逐出这个城市。
    现在，棉兰已经恢复正常状态。
    印度尼西亚陆军总部在17日晚间宣布，有八名参预棉兰骚乱事件的第一军区军官已经被解除军职，其中包括奈恩戈兰少校、西雷加尔少校和波汉上尉。
    新华社雅加达18日电　雅加达“人民日报”今天指出，北苏门答腊首府棉兰的骚乱是叛乱分子卢比斯和西姆波朗长期策划的事件。他们在政府军队集中力量同中苏门答腊侯赛尼叛乱集团作斗争的时候发动骚乱，是为了减轻政府军队对中苏门答腊的巴东和武吉丁宜的压力，从而转移人民的注意力和扩大战线。这家报纸说，这证明了中苏门答腊的叛乱分子已经处于绝望的境地，而爱国军队和人民的力量是强大的。
