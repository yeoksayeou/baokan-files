This Year's Quarrel Season
Xi Linsheng

    Starting in 1956, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has entered a season of quarrels every February. British officials and newspapers form one side, and West German ones the other. Both sides engage in mutual attacks and insults over the issue of paying the maintenance fees for foreign troops stationed in West Germany, sometimes becoming quite lively when tensions rise.

    The matter began in 1956. Before 1955, West Germany was still a defeated and occupied country, so it was natural to pay for the upkeep of the American, British, and French occupying forces. However, in 1954, Western countries and West Germany signed the Paris Agreement, stating that “sovereignty” would be returned to West Germany from 1955. Therefore, at the end of 1955, the West German government, posing as a "sovereign" state, announced that from 1956 it would stop paying the maintenance fees for the US, British and French troops stationed in West Germany, to demonstrate "equality" between "sovereign" states.

    The US, Britain, and France, especially Britain, were very unhappy with this move by West Germany. Britain believed that regardless of whether you are a sovereign state or not, you have to pay as long as our troops are stationed on your land. Britain also listed several reasons: first, these troops are "defending" West Germany; second, West Germany has made a lot of money in recent years, but its military burden is very light, which is unfair, and they must pay some money. According to foreign newspapers, Britain was particularly aggressive in the quarrel because it wanted to take the opportunity to increase West Germany's burden in order to weaken West Germany's power in competing with Britain in the world market.

    Thus, everyone was unwilling to yield. West German newspapers scolded Britain as "illegal plunder" and "despised." British newspapers said that West Germany was not fulfilling its "duty" and even threatened to withdraw troops from West Germany... For a time, those common high-sounding words like NATO allies being "united" and "closely cooperating" were all blown away without a trace.

    As a result, with the support of the US and France, West Germany had to succumb, reducing the payment from 3.2 billion marks to 2.4 billion marks. This is how they got through the first year.

    In February 1957, the quarrel started again, for the same reasons. However, the West German Finance Minister proposed a new method, saying that West Germany would not pay this money, but would decide to purchase weapons from "allied countries" in the future, especially taking care of British business to let them make big money. But Britain didn't agree, saying: West Germany only makes empty promises, saying it would buy so much weapons from Britain, but only bought a little, and mostly chose American business, so Britain didn't get much benefit. So the quarrel ended again with West Germany continuing to pay the maintenance fee.

    In the blink of an eye, it's February again, and this quarrel within NATO has restarted.

    However, this year's quarrel is different. The West German government's attitude is much tougher than usual. It firmly insists on "refusing to pay" the maintenance fee. The British government even complained to the NATO Permanent Council about this matter; NATO Secretary-General Spaak also went to West Germany to make "passionate appeals," asking West Germany to consider NATO's "political unity." But the West German government remains "unmoved." It even stated: it would rather deposit 100 million pounds in Britain without collecting interest as an advance payment for purchasing arms. British newspapers said this was simply an "insult" to Britain, "like throwing a penny into the hat of a persistent beggar." A British authority was so angry that he said like Ah Q: West Germany should not be arrogant, its "participation in NATO in 1955 was mainly the initiative of Britain."

    What made West Germany so tough this year?

    This year, the trend of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind has become established. The strength of the United States, the head of the imperialist camp, is dwarfed, and West Germany has never taken Britain seriously, so West Germany is taking the opportunity to rise and wants to be the head of Western Europe. It holds the West European Common Market in its left hand and wields the Franco-German-Italian arms alliance in its right hand, and its power is indeed not small. So this year West Germany dares to stand up straight. This is the first reason.

    To compete with the US and Britain for status, West Germany currently lacks an important magic weapon: its military capital is still insufficient. The US and Britain are atomic powers in the capitalist camp, while West Germany has neither a strong army, nor sufficient military equipment, nor atomic bombs. This, of course, puts it at a disadvantage. Therefore, the ambitious West German militarists want to find a way to build atomic bombs. Now that France, Germany, and Italy have formed an arms alliance, there is hope for building atomic bombs. But the problem is that building atomic bombs requires a lot of money, and this year West Germany's military budget has greatly increased. If, in addition to this, it has to pay the expenses of the US, British, and French troops stationed in the country, then West Germany will be overwhelmed. This is the second reason.

    Although West Germany has made some money in recent years, since 1957 the God of Wealth seems not to be taking care of it, and now industrial production, foreign trade, and foreign orders are all declining step by step. In addition, Britain and the United States are also struggling economically, and the future is indeed uncertain. The West German Minister of Economy is already telling people to tighten their belts. In these days, asking West Germany to take out several billion marks again would cause great damage to the West German economy. The West German government is certainly unwilling. This is the third reason.

    Now West Germany's attitude has not softened. British newspapers are already calling for the US, Britain, and France to "take the toughest stance against Bonn." Regardless of how this quarrel will end this year, it always shows that the contradictions within the imperialist camp are irreconcilable and can only deepen day by day. (Attached picture)

### 今年的吵架季节

    今年的吵架季节
    席林生
    从1956年起，北大西洋集团内部每到2月就开始了一个吵架的季节。英国的官员和报纸为一方，西德的为另一方，双方为了支付驻西德外国军队的维持费问题展开了相互攻击和对骂，有时到紧张处煞是热闹。
    事情是1956年闹开头的。1955年以前西德还是个战败的被占领国家，那当然得出钱养活美、英、法的占领军。但是1954年西方国家和西德订了个巴黎协定，说从1955年要把“主权”还给西德。于是，西德政府在1955年底就以一个“主权”国家的姿态宣布，1956年起将停付美英法驻西德军队的维持费，以示“主权”国家之间的“平等”。
    美英法，特别是英国对西德的这一手大不高兴。英国认为，不管你什么主权国家不主权国家，我们军队还驻在你的土地上你就得付钱。英国还列举了几条理由：一、这些军队是“保卫”西德的；二、这几年西德发了不少财，可是它的军事负担倒很轻，这不公平，非得拿些钱出来不行。据外国报纸说，英国所以吵得特别凶，是想乘机加重西德的负担，以便削弱西德在世界市场上和英国抢生意的力量。
    于是大家互不服贴。西德报纸骂英国是“非法的掠夺”，“受人憎恨”。英国报纸则说西德不尽“本份”，并且还威吓着要把军队从西德撤退……。一时，那些惯用的什么北大西洋盟国“团结一致”、“密切合作”等等冠冕堂皇的话，都被吹散得无影无踪了。
    结果由于英国得到美法的支持，西德不得不屈服了，将支付的费用由三十二亿马克减到二十四亿马克。这样度过了第一年。
    1957年2月，争吵又起了，理由还是那些。不过西德财政部长提了个新办法，说西德不支付这笔钱，但是今后决定在“盟国”购买武器，特别要照顾英国的生意，让它赚大钱。但是英国不干，它说：西德尽说大话，说要在英国买多少多少武器，结果只买了一点点，大部分都挑了美国的生意，英国没有捞到多大好处。于是争吵又以西德继续支付维持费而结束。
    转眼到今年2月，北大西洋集团里的这个吵架又重新展开了。
    但是今年吵架的情况有了不同。西德政府的态度比往常强硬得多。它一口咬定“拒绝支付”维持费。英国政府为了这件事还特别告状到北大西洋集团常任理事会；北大西洋集团的秘书长斯巴克也特地到西德去作“激动的恳求”，要西德顾全北大西洋集团在“政治上的团结一致”。但是西德政府还是“一毛不拔”。它甚至表示：要末拿一亿英镑去存放在英国，西德也不收利息，作为购买军火的预付款项。英国报纸说这简直是对英国的“侮辱”，“好像是向缠绕不休的乞丐的帽子里投一个铜板”。一位英国权威人士甚至气得像阿Q一样地说：西德不要神气活现，它“在1955年得以参加北大西洋公约组织，这主要是英国的创议”。
    什么原因使西德今年这样强硬呢？
    今年东风压倒西风之势已成帝国主义阵营头子美国的力量相形见拙了，而西德原来就没有把英国放在眼里，所以西德就乘机而起，想当西欧大陆上的头目。它左手拿着西欧共同市场，右手抡起法、德、意三国军火同盟，威势确也不小。所以今年西德就敢把腰杆子挺得硬硬的。此其一。
    要跟美英争地位，西德目前还缺少一样重要的法宝。那就是军事资本还不足。美英是资本主义阵营里的原子大国，而西德是一无强大军队、二无足够军备、三无原子炸弹。这当然得吃亏。所以野心勃勃的西德军国主义者就要设法造原子弹。现在法、德、意三国结成军火同盟，造原子弹就有了希望。但是问题是造原子弹要大笔的钱，今年西德的军事预算就大大增加。如果在此之外再要支付美、英、法的驻军费用，那西德就不胜负担。此其二。
    西德近几年来虽然发了一些财，但是从1957年起财神菩萨似乎不大照顾，现在工业生产、对外贸易、国外定货都在一步步跌下来。再加英、美在经济上也自身难保，前途的确未可乐观。西德经济部长已经在叫人民勒紧裤带。在这种日子里再要西德拿出几十亿马克，这要使西德经济遭受很大损失。西德政府当然不甘心。此其三。
    现在西德态度还没有软下来。英国报纸则早在叫着要美、英、法三国“对波恩采取最强硬的方针”。不管今年这次吵架究将如何收场，但是这总是表明了帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾是无法调和的、它只能一日深似一日。（附图片）
