    Planting Trees While the Ground is Still Frosty

    As the spring warms and the snow melts, the frozen soil in Jianchang County, Liaoning mountainous area, has thawed to the depth of a shovel. The people of the entire county have broken with the past practice of planting trees around the Qingming Festival and have begun to plant trees while the ground is still frosty. The Jianqiang Agricultural Cooperative in Suzhu Yingzi Township mobilized more than 300 men and women to plant more than 20,000 poplar and willow trees overnight, greening all the areas beside villages, rivers, houses, and roads.

    顶浆造林
    春暖雪融，辽宁山区建昌县冻土已化一锹深。全县人民打破历年清明前后造林的常规，开始顶浆植树造林。该县素珠营子乡坚强农业社发动三百多名男女劳动力，在一夜间，栽了二万多棵杨树和柳树，把村旁、河旁、宅旁、路旁全部绿化。
