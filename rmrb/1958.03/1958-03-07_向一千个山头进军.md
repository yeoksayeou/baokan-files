Mountains—A Source of Wealth

"Six parts mountains, one part water, two parts fields, and one part roads and villages." This is a summary of Jiangxi Province's topography. In the entire province, the ratio of mountains to fields is three to one.

What rich mountains! The boundless sea of forests remains green and lush even in the severe winter. Patches of fir and pine forests, along with noble sandalwood, camphor, and catalpa trees, are found everywhere here. Jiangxi is the home of bamboo; there is as much as you could want. Chestnuts and acorns, used as raw materials for winemaking, cover the mountains and forests like a blanket. The vast expanse of cogongrass and fallen bamboo shoots are inexhaustible raw materials for papermaking.

Cut a pine tree, and resin will flow out. Cut down pine branches and bury them in the soil, and shiitake mushrooms will grow. Do you need corks? There are countless cork oaks here. Peel them once a year, and after peeling, they grow back; they grow better each time you peel them.

These mountains have tens of millions of mu of oil-tea fields. These mountains can produce hundreds of thousands of dan of tea each year. These mountains are good places to develop sericulture.

However, because no one has developed them for a long time, these precious mountains have been sleeping. Large trees, as big as a person can embrace, rot and fall; large swathes of bamboo forests rot away; oil-tea mountains are not cultivated, and tea trees are not tended to and become increasingly barren. As for other various "treasures," of course, they are left to grow and die on their own.

Because Wanbao Mountain has not been developed, it has become a barren mountain in people's minds. Barren mountains become a burden, not a hope. So people think: Why is Jiangxi poor? It is because there are more mountains than fields. They do not see the mountains as a source of wealth.

There are many such unreasonable things in life. But unreasonable things cannot last forever. The Communist Party has always been a pioneer in eliminating the unreasonable. To benefit the people, the Party is determined to restore the original appearance of the mountains—a source of wealth.

Bold Ideals and Revolutionary Spirit

"If we compare the rural economy to an eagle, then the 45 million mu of cultivated land is its main body, while the 150 million mu of mountainous areas and 22 million mu of water surfaces are the eagle's two wings. We must develop the mountainous areas and water surfaces so that the eagle can spread its wings and fly high." This is a bold statement by Shao Shiping, Governor of Jiangxi Province and Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Since June and July of last year, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has been exploring, studying, and promoting the development of mountainous areas.

A bold ideal is being conceived: to transform barren mountains into fruit and flower mountains in ten years and to build up all the mountainous areas of the province.

A strategic deployment emerged with the ideal: to establish a thousand mountainous forestry, agricultural, and animal husbandry bases, using these bases as the core to drive the surrounding farmers and march into the mountainous areas in a big way. That is, to divide all the mountainous areas of the province into a thousand circles, with state-owned reclamation farms owned by the whole people as the core and agricultural cooperatives as the reliance, to form a vast system of mountain forest construction and management. Its task is to reclaim 45 million mu of barren mountains and develop and manage the existing mountain forests.

At that time, people's attitudes towards this ideal were not entirely consistent. Some people found a bunch of reasons, worrying that this ideal could not become a reality. They believed that: first, Jiangxi has few people and many fields. In many southern provinces, each rural person has only an average of one mu of land or even less, while Jiangxi's 15 million rural people already have an average of three mu of land per person. If we go to develop this more than 100 million mu of mountainous areas, where will we find so many people? The mountain forests managed by a thousand state-owned reclamation farms cover an area of 30 million mu. Assuming that one laborer manages 30 mu, it will require one million laborers. Adding the labor force required by various processing plants and workshops in the mountainous areas, the total number will reach more than one million. Allocating cadres at a rate of 3%, we need 40,000 to 50,000 cadres. Where can we find so many cadres? Second, the mountains are poor, require great effort, and yield small returns. It is not worth the effort to develop them. These reasons are actually just two words: difficulty. Difficulties certainly exist. The question is people's attitude towards difficulties, whether to let the mountainous areas of Jiangxi continue to be barren and poor, or to bravely turn ideals into reality. The Party chose the latter.

If there is a shortage of labor in the mountainous areas, we can find ways to immigrate people from the plains, from the cities, and from other provinces; as for the view that the mountains are poor, it is fundamentally wrong. The biggest difficulty lies in mobilizing these tens of thousands of key personnel for mountain area construction.

The great rectification movement promoted the development of mountainous areas. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to mobilize 45,000 of the 50,000 cadres who were sent down to the countryside to go to the mountains as the first batch of builders in the mountainous areas. And in a very short period of time, they completed the preparations for going to the mountains. On the eve of the New Year of 1958, a large number of cadres followed in the footsteps of the Red Army soldiers of more than 20 years ago and entered the various weed-covered and sparsely populated mountains.

In this army, in addition to tens of thousands of young cadres, there were also 79 veteran cadres above the level of the prefectural committee and nearly a thousand county-level cadres. This demonstrated the Party's determination: these 45,000 people are not only pioneers, but also must temper themselves into key personnel for mountain area construction who are both red and expert in the struggle for production.

The combination of bold ideals and revolutionary spirit produces great action. The battle to march towards a thousand mountains and transform barren mountains into socialist gold and silver mountains has begun.

"Socialism has gone up the mountain!"

The Kuomintang reactionaries carried out a great massacre of the people of Jiangxi after the Central Red Army marched north on the Long March, reducing the population of the mountainous areas of Jiangxi by half. The consequences of this heinous crime are: the mountainous areas are becoming increasingly barren, and the people in the mountainous areas are constantly flowing to the plains and to the cities. After liberation, although we have provided various forms of support for the production and people's lives in the mountainous areas, the situation of population outflow in the mountainous areas has not been fundamentally changed. In the mountainous areas, one can even hear such a painful saying: "Socialism exists in the cities and on the plains, but socialism will not go up the mountain!"

However, as long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party, things must change.

When these more than 40,000 cadres marched into the mountainous areas in the great storm on the eve of the New Year, it was like the Eighth Route Army marching from the old base areas to the new base areas 20 years ago. The masses were excited and celebrated. Ma Tingshi, the director of the Jinggangshan Comprehensive Reclamation Farm, was the Deputy Procurator of Jiangxi Province before going to the mountain. He is from Yongxin near Jinggangshan and a veteran Red Army soldier of 1931. Many cadres and masses in this area know him. When he took more than 600 cadres to Jinggangshan this time, it caused a sensation among the masses along the way. There are two roads to go to Jinggangshan, one starting from Yongxin County and the other starting from Suichuan County. The cadres and masses of the two counties were vying for the team going to the mountain to pass through their own place. In the end, there was no way but to divide the team into two large detachments to advance.

Things have changed so quickly, "Socialism has gone up the mountain!" This is what the masses are discussing now.

On New Year's Eve in 1957, snow was falling from the sky, and the farmers in the mountainous areas were staying at home and stopped working. However, the cadres who went to Jinggangshan continued to produce in the wind and snow. This incident moved an old woman in Xiaoxingzhou, and she went to our cadres and said seriously: "You are really good cadres educated by Chairman Mao. I have two daughters who I must marry to you in the future!"

The cadres who went to the mountain have also changed in these two months. Before and after going to the mountain, it is not that all cadres have no ideological problems at all. Think about it, dozens of people sleeping in a thatched shed. This alone is such a big revolution for those Shanghai girls who are used to living in foreign-style houses since they were young. It is said that a young man who had a lover but was not married, because he had just gone to the mountain and could not adapt to this difficult living environment, his emotions fluctuated very violently, but he was unwilling to tell it, so he desperately wrote letters to his lover. He wrote forty "love letters" in twenty days on the mountain, averaging two letters a day.

The struggle of labor is the most profound education for people. The richness of the mountainous areas and the prospects of construction also encouraged these young people. And after this winter's labor, the current difficult environment will be improved, and they will be able to live in houses built with their own hands in the spring. By that time, there will also be places to take a bath. Don't underestimate this point. The bathing problem was once a "focus" of the ideological struggle for some cadres who went to the mountain. But the most important thing is that they understand the significance of going to the mountain and begin to understand that they are engaged in a solemn cause, not something lowly. So, some comrades who originally planned to "get through these few years" are now planning to bring their families to the mountain to work. More than 95% of the cadres have performed well in labor and are determined to graduate from this "agricultural university."

The arrival of cadres in the mountains has had a dramatic impact on social customs. Now there are thousands of middle school students in Nanchang City who want to go to the mountains. The government cannot immediately agree to their request, because the tens of thousands of cadres who have already gone to the mountain have not been completely arranged yet. Not long ago, the Jiangxi Hotel in Nanchang held a meeting of the heads of various reclamation farms. This news was learned by some students. Seven middle school students ran to the Jiangxi Hotel and insisted that the head of the Jiulian Mountain Reclamation Farm take them to the mountain. It took a lot of effort to persuade them to go back. But we all remember how difficult it was to mobilize urban students to go to the countryside and to the mountains a year ago! Rectification is the key to everything, and the great promotion effect of the socialist cause generated by the rectification movement is vividly illustrated here.

Striving for the Second Round of Applause from the Masses

Currently, the province's 99 state-owned reclamation farms plan to manage a total forestry area of 4 million mu. Each mountain has stipulated the area of mountain forests linked to agricultural cooperatives. The resource surveys of each mountain base have been basically completed, and long-term plans and production plans for 1958 have been proposed. The original plan to develop a thousand mountains in ten years has been rejected. Everyone is determined to strive to achieve this goal within five years. Not long ago, the reporter visited Comrade Cao Jingyi, the director of the Damao Mountain Reclamation Farm. He told the reporter what the Damao Mountain base plans to do this year. These are all numbers, but from these numbers, we can see the wealth of the mountains and the future of the mountains:

Forestry: Repair 10,000 mu of mountain forests, artificially update 400 mu of cutover land, plant 1,000 mu of Chinese fir, plant 20 mu of red-flowered oil-tea, sow 20 mu of oil-tea, and plant 70 mu of palm trees, cultivate 10 mu of new seedlings.

Fruit trees: Plant a total of 8,800 various pear and peach trees on 292 mu.

Agriculture: Reclaim 2,500 mu of paddy and dry land, replant 827 mu, and sow various crops on 1,511 mu.

Animal husbandry: Raise 2,500 head of cattle, pigs, and rabbits.

Small-scale industry: Establish a rosin factory (annual output of 250,000 jin of rosin), a sawmill, a rice processing plant, a paper mill (annual output of 7,000 tons of paper), a cork-rubber factory, a phosphate mine, and a small hydropower station each.

Handicraft workshops: Establish a lime kiln, a brick and tile kiln, and a charcoal yard each. Two wineries, seven tofu workshops, and two water mills.

This is only the first year's plan for one mountain, Damao Mountain. In five years, a thousand mountain bases will be established throughout the province. These thousand mountains will drive the surrounding agricultural cooperatives, and it can be imagined that after five years of construction, the face of the mountainous areas of Jiangxi will be completely renewed. And the fundamental change in the appearance of the mountainous areas will inevitably affect the progress of agriculture and industry in the entire province. At that time, the eagle's wings will be fuller, and it will be able to fly farther and higher. However, we are not those who wait for victory, nor are we poets who only fantasize. We must truly and earnestly lay the production foundation of the mountainous areas through hard work. "When we went to the mountain, the masses gave us the first round of applause. Now we must blossom and bear fruit in labor and production and strive for the second round of applause from the masses!" This is the current goal of the 45,000 cadres in Jiangxi Province who have gone to the mountain. (Attached image)

    向一千个山头进军
    本报记者　张沛　李连斌
              山——财富的源泉
    “六山一水二分田，一分道路和庄院。”这是江西省地形的概括。在全省山与田是三与一之比。
    多么富饶的山呵。无边的林海，在严寒的冬天依然碧绿蔚青。成片的杉林、松林，和那高贵的檀木、樟木、梓木，在这里到处都有。江西是竹子的故乡，要多少有多少。板栗和作制酒原料的橡子像毯子一样铺满了山林。满山遍野的芭茅草和脱落的笋壳是取之不尽用之不竭的造纸原料。
    在松树上划一刀，就会流出松脂来。把松树枝砍倒埋在土里就会长出香菇来。你需要软木塞吗？这里有数不尽的栓皮栎。每年剥一次皮，剥了再长，长了再剥，剥一次比一次长得好。
    这些山头有几千万亩油茶地。这些山头每年能够生产几十万担茶叶。这些山头是发展蚕桑的好地方。
    可是由于长期没有人去开发，这些宝山一直沉睡着。合抱的大树腐朽了倒下了；大片大片的竹林，烂掉了；油茶山得不到开垦，茶树得不到抚育而日益荒芜。至于其它各式各样的“财宝”，当然只好任它自生自灭。
    万宝山由于没有开发，在人们的意识里成为荒山。荒山就变成一种负担，而不是一种希望。于是人们就认为：江西为什么穷呵？就是因为山比田多。而不把山看成是财富的源泉。
    生活中有很多这样不合理的事情。但是不合理的事情终归不能永存。共产党历来是破除不合理的先锋。为了造福于人民，党决心要恢复山的本来面目——财富的源泉。
    大胆的理想和革命精神
    “如果把农村经济比作一只鹰，那末已经耕种的四千五百万亩土地是它的主体，而一亿五千万亩的山区和二千二百万亩的水面，则是鹰的两翼。我们必须开发山区，开发水面，使雄鹰能展翅高飞。”这是江西省省长、中共江西省委书记邵式平同志的一席壮语。
    从去年6、7月起，中共江西省委就一直在摸索、研究和促进山区的开发。
    一个大胆的理想在孕育着：用十年时间，变荒山为花果山，把全省的山区都建设起来。
    战略部署随着理想出现了：建立一千个山区林、农、牧业基地，以这些基地为核心带动周围农民，向山区大进军。也就是把全省山区划成一千个圈圈，以全民所有制的国营垦殖场为核心、以农业合作社为依靠，形成一个庞大的山林建设和管理的体系。它的任务是垦殖四千五百万亩荒山，开发和管理已有的山林。
    当时，人们对这个理想的态度并不是完全一致的。有的人找出一堆理由，担心这个理想不能成为现实。他们认为：第一是江西人少田多，南方很多省农村每人平均只有一亩地甚至不到一亩，而江西一千五百万农村人口，每人平均已有三亩地。如再去开发这一亿多亩的山区，那里有这样多人？一千个国营垦殖场经营的山林面积达三千万亩，以一个劳动力经营三十亩算，就要一百万劳动力，再加上山区各种加工场、作坊所需要的劳动力，总数达一百万以上。按3％来配备干部，需要四、五万的干部。我们到那里去找这样多的干部？第二，山穷，费力大，收益小，花大力去开发是得不偿失。这些理由实际上只是两个字：困难。困难诚然是存在的。问题在于人们对待困难的态度，或者是让江西的山区继续荒芜和贫困下去，或者是勇敢地把理想变为现实。党选择了后者。
    山区的劳动力少，可以想办法从平原、从城市、从其它省移民；至于山穷的看法，则根本是错误的。最大的困难在于从那里调集这几万山区建设的骨干。
    伟大的整风运动，促进了山区的开发。中共江西省委决定把下放的五万干部中的四万五千人动员上山，作第一批山区的建设者。并且在很短的时间内完成了上山的准备，在1958年新年的前夕，大批干部踏着二十多年前红军战士的脚迹，进入了各个野草丛生、人烟稀少的山头。
    在这支大军中，除了几万青年干部以外，还有地委以上的老干部七十九人，县级干部近一千人。这表现了党的决心：这四万五千人不仅仅是拓荒者，而且要在生产斗争中把自己锻练成为又红又专的山区建设的骨干。
    大胆的理想和革命的精神相结合就产生了伟大的行动，向一千个山头大进军，变荒山为社会主义的金银山的战斗序幕就此揭开。
            “社会主义上了山！”
    国民党反动派，在中央红军北上长征以后对江西人民进行的大屠杀，使江西山区的人口减少了一半。这个残暴得令人发指的罪恶所遗留下的后果是：山区日益荒芜，山区的人不断流向平原、流向城市。解放以后，我们虽然对山区的生产和人民生活进行了各种支援，但山区人口外流的状况也还没有得到根本改变。在山区里甚至会听到这样一种令人痛苦的说法：“社会主义在城市里有，在平原上有，但是社会主义不会上山！”
    然而，只要有了共产党的领导，事情就一定要变化。
    当这四万多干部在新年前夕的大风雨中向山区挺进以后，就好像二十年前的八路军从老根据地挺进到新根据地一样，群情振奋，万民欢腾。井冈山综合垦殖场场长马廷士，在上山以前是江西省的副检察长，他是井冈山附近的永新人，1931年的红军老战士，这一带有许多干部和群众都认识他。当这次他带着六百多干部上井冈山时，轰动了沿途群众。上井冈山有两条路可走，一条从永新县出发，一条从遂川县出发，两个县的干部和群众都争着要上山的队伍从自己的地方走。最后没有办法，只好把队伍分成两个大队前进。
    事情变化得这样快，“社会主义上山了！”这是现在群众的议论。
    1957年的除夕，天空飘着大雪，山区的农民都待在家中停止劳动了，然而上井冈山的干部仍在风雪中继续生产。这件事感动了小行洲地方的一个老太太，她找到我们的干部正正经经地说：“你们真是毛主席教育出来的好干部，我有两个姑娘将来一定要嫁给你们！”
    上山的干部在这两个月中也发生了变化。在上山以前和上山以后，并不是一切干部都没有一点思想问题。想想看，几十个人挤在一个茅棚里睡觉，仅仅这一点，对于那些从小就住惯了洋房的上海姑娘来说，是一个多么大的革命呵。听说，有一个有爱人而没有结婚的男青年，由于刚刚上山，一下不能适应这种艰苦的生活环境，情绪上波动得很厉害，但是又不愿讲出来，于是就拚命给爱人写信，上山二十天写了四十封“情书”，平均每天写两封信。
    劳动斗争，对于人们的教育是最深刻的。山区的富饶、建设的远景也鼓舞了这些年轻人。而目前的艰苦环境经过这一个冬天的劳动，在春季以后，就可以住上用自己的双手筑起来的房屋。到那个时候也可以有地方洗澡了。不要小看了这一点，洗澡问题曾经是有些上山干部思想斗争的一个“焦点”呢。但是最主要的是对上山的意义明白了，开始了解自己是在从事一件庄严的事业，而不是什么卑下的事情。于是一些原来打算“熬过这几年”的同志，现在计划接家属一起上山劳动了。95％以上的干部在劳动中表现很好，都下定决心，要在这所“农业大学”毕业。
    干部上山，对于社会风气产生了剧烈的影响。现在光南昌市就有几千中学生要求上山。政府还不能马上答应他们的要求，因为已上山的几万干部还没有完全安排好呢。不久以前在南昌的江西饭店举行了各个垦殖场的场长会议，这个消息被一些学生知道了。有七个中学生跑到江西饭店去，一定要九连山的场长带他们上山去。费了好半天的事，才把他们说服回去。可是我们都记得，一年以前，动员城市学生下乡上山是一件多么困难的事呵！整风是提起一切的纲，由整风运动所产生的对社会主义事业的巨大推进作用，在这里得到了生动的说明。
          争取群众的第二次鼓掌
    现在全省九十九个国营垦殖场，共计划经营林业面积四百万亩。每个山头都规定了联系农业合作社的山林面积。各个山头基地对本山的资源已经基本勘查完毕，纷纷提出远景规划和1958年的生产计划。原来认为十年才能开发一千个山头的计划已经遭到否定，大家决心争取在五年以内达到这个目标。不久以前，记者访问了大茅山的垦殖场场长曹镜沂同志，他告诉记者大茅山基地在今年准备干些什么。这些都是数字，然而从这些数字中我们可以看到山的财富和山的未来：
    林业：修整山林一万亩、人工更新迹地四百亩、种植杉木一千亩、种植红花油茶二十亩、播种油茶二十亩、种植棕榈树七十亩、培养新苗十亩。
    果树：种植各种梨桃二百九十二亩共八千八百株。
    农业：开荒水旱田二千五百亩、复种八二七亩、播种各种作物一千五百一十一亩。
    畜牧业：饲养牛、猪、兔二千五百头。
    小型工业：举办松香厂（年产松香二十五万斤）、锯木厂、米加工厂、造纸厂（年产纸七千吨）、挎胶栓皮厂、磷矿、小型水电站各一个。
    手工作坊：石灰窑、砖瓦窑、木炭场各一个。酒坊二个、豆腐坊七个、水碓二个。
    这只是大茅山一个山头第一年的计划。在五年中全省将建立起一千个山头基地。这一千个山头又将把周围的农业社带动起来，可以想像，经过五年的建设，江西山区的面貌必将焕然一新。而山区面貌的根本改变，又必然会影响到全省农业和工业的进展。那时，雄鹰的翅膀更丰满了，就能够飞得更远更高。然而我们不是胜利的等待者，不是只会狂想的诗人。我们必须切切实实经过艰苦劳动打下山区的生产基础。“我们上山时，群众给我们鼓了第一次掌。现在我们一定要在劳动生产上开花结果，争取群众的第二次鼓掌！”这就是江西省四万五千上山干部当前的奋斗目标。（附图片）
