    Xiaogan to Achieve "Double One-Five" This Year
    1,500 Jin per Mu for Grain, 150 Jin per Mu for Cotton
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Gu Weijin reports: The Xiaogan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is actively strengthening leadership in spring plowing preparations in order to achieve "Double One-Five" (meaning 1,500 jin of grain per mu and 150 jin of cotton per mu) throughout the county this year.
    The county's water conservancy projects this year amount to 94.7 million cubic meters. More than 80% of the work has already been completed, and all projects are expected to be finished by the end of March. The majority of the county's more than 800,000 mu of paddy fields can be guaranteed a good harvest after water conservancy construction. The county's task of accumulating fertilizer this year is 1 billion dan, an increase of four to five times compared to last year. To complete this heavy task, the county has adopted measures such as "two exchanges" (exchanging wall soil and stove soil), "three diligences" (diligently hoeing the pens, padding the pens, and sweeping the pens), "four diggings" (digging topsoil, pond mud, sod, and ditch bottoms), and high-temperature composting to rapidly develop the fertilizer accumulation campaign. More than 500 million dan of fertilizer have already been accumulated, and it is estimated that the annual task of 1 billion dan can be completed before rice transplanting. More than 70,000 mu of backward fields have been improved, and yields are expected to increase from 300 jin to 800-900 jin, or even more than 1,000 jin. These are all favorable conditions for achieving "Double One-Five."
    In terms of spring plowing preparation work, many agricultural cooperatives this year have broken the old rule of "no movement in the first month, no management in the second month, busy in the third month." They started preparing seedbeds in December, and most of the seedbeds were plowed twice, harrowed twice, and smoothed once before the Spring Festival. Now that the seedling season is approaching, various localities are preparing germination barrels and grass covers (both woven from rice straw) to prevent cold weather from affecting seed soaking and seedling planting when the season arrives. This work is progressing smoothly. It is expected that the entire county can soak seeds and plant seedlings five to seven days earlier, which will greatly help increase the production of 400,000 mu of early rice. The method of "three guarantees to the team, four implementations to the field, knowing the whole year early" has been developed from key promotion to comprehensive promotion. According to the planned targets, the average grain income per household in the county's twelve districts this year is more than 7 million jin, and seven of the districts have an average grain income of 10,000 jin per household. This is a great encouragement to the masses, and they are all actively striving to achieve the "Double One-Five" plan.

    孝感今年实现“双一五”
    粮食亩产一千五  棉花亩产一百五
    本报讯  记者古维进报道：中共孝感县委为了今年全县实现“双一五”（即粮食亩产一千五百斤，棉花亩产一百五十斤），积极加强春耕准备的领导。
    今年全县的水利工程是九千四百七十万方，现在已经完成工程80％以上，3月底以前，全部工程可以完成。全县八十余万亩水稻，经过兴修水利，绝大部分可以保收。今年全县的积肥任务十亿担，比去年增长四、五倍。为了完成这个繁重的任务，全县采取了两换（换垣土、灶土）、三勤（勤锄圈、垫圈、扫圈）、四挖（挖地皮、塘泥、草皮、沟底）和高温堆肥等措施，使积肥运动迅速开展。现在已积肥五亿多担，预计插秧以前，可以完成全年十亿担的积肥任务。有七万多亩落后田已经改良土壤，产量要由三百斤提高到八、九百斤，甚至一千多斤。这些都是实现“双一五”的有利条件。
    在春耕准备工作方面，今年许多农业社打破了
  “正月不动，二月不管，三月着忙”的老规矩，在腊月间就开始整理秧田，春节前大部分秧田进行了两耕、两耙、一耖。现在下秧季节将到，各地都在准备催芽桶和草遮子（都是稻草编织的），以防备季节到来，天气寒冷，影响浸种和下秧。这个工作进行很顺利，预计全县可以提前五—七天浸种、下秧，这对于四十万亩早稻的增产有很大帮助。“三包四到田，一年早知道”的办法，已从重点推广发展到全面推广，根据规划的指标计算，今年全县十二个区每户平均收入粮食七百多万斤，其中有七个区每户平均收入粮食万斤，这对群众是很大的鼓舞，他们都积极为实现“双一五”规划而奋斗。
