Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, March 22nd: According to TASS, American industrialist Cyrus Eaton published an article in "Maclean's Magazine", stressing the dangers of nuclear war and calling for a relaxation of international tensions, as well as the restoration of trust and peaceful coexistence between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Eaton said: "We can and should trust the Russians, and should find a basis for negotiation with them. The provocative, insulting and threatening approach we Americans are now taking can only lead to a terrible end, that is, a world war."

Eaton pointed out: "Americans must not only change their foreign policy, but also change their position in the entire international relations system, especially in their relationship with another major power - Russia. For many years, Americans have formed a self-deceptive creed: 'Everything in America is good, everything in Russia is bad.' I don't think history will judge it that way."

Eaton believes that Dulles's "extreme hatred of everything Russian" has gone "too far". He said, "We do not have the ability to eliminate Russia and the Communists," and the United States does not have the military and economic strength or diplomatic capital to "overthrow communism."

Eaton denounced the U.S.'s aggressive policy of surrounding the Soviet Union with military bases and rocket bases. He said: "If we were Russians, and we knew that American planes carrying nuclear weapons were circling day and night not far from our cities, a large circle of rocket bases gradually surrounded our country, and we also knew that American politicians directly responsible for US-Soviet relations lived by causing hostility and distrust between the two countries, how would we feel at this time?"

Eaton finally emphasized that the United States is able to "find a basis for peaceful coexistence with the Russians through negotiation."

    伊顿批评美国外交政策
    要求美苏两国和平共处
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社渥太华22日讯：美国工业家赛勒斯·伊顿在“麦克林半月刊”发表文章，强调指出核战争的危险性，并且要求缓和国际紧张局势，要求恢复苏联和美国之间的信任和和平相处。
    伊顿说：“我们能够而且应当相信俄国人，应当找到同他们协商的基础。我们美国现在采取挑衅、侮辱和威胁的方针，这只能导致一个可怕的结局，那就是世界大战。”
    伊顿指出：“美国人不仅必须改变他们的外交政策，而且还必须改变他们在整个国际关系体系中的地位，特别是改变它同另一个大国——俄国的关系中的地位。许多年来，美国人形成了一种自欺欺人的信条：‘美国的一切都是美好的，俄国的一切都是糟糕的’。我并不认为，历史的判决会是那样。”
    伊顿认为，杜勒斯“对俄国的一切都恨之入骨”，这未免“做得太过火”。他说，“我们没有能力去消灭俄国和共产党人”，美国不具有“推翻共产主义”的军事和经济力量以及外交资本。
    伊顿斥责美国以军事基地和火箭基地包围苏联的侵略政策。他说：“假如我们是俄国人，而且我们知道载着核武器的美国飞机昼夜不停地在离我们城市不远的地方盘旋，一大圈火箭基地逐渐地包围了我们的国家，我们还知道对美俄关系负直接责任的美国政界人士以引起这两国的敌视和不信任为生，这个时候，我们会有什么感想呢？”
    伊顿最后着重指出，美国是能够“通过谈判同俄国人找到和平共处的基础的”。
