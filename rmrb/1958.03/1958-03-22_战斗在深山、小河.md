Fighting in the Deep Mountains and Small Rivers

    Suichuan County in Jiangxi Province has timber reserves of over 8.8 million cubic meters. This year, the county plans to produce over 91,000 cubic meters of timber, an increase of 48% over last year. Most of the timber is felled in remote forest areas, making felling and transportation more arduous than in previous years. The forestry workers of Suichuan County have demonstrated revolutionary vigor. During the felling season, they go up the mountains with their tools at the crack of dawn and fight on the hills all day, only returning home in the evening. The carriers shuttle back and forth on the mountainsides, where they can't see the mountaintops above or the valley bottoms below. They also built suspended bridges out of wood on the steep rocky cliffs of Jinggang Mountain, skillfully transporting the timber one by one from above to the small streams. During the floating season, the water transport workers, day and night, pole their rafts through the rocky riverbeds, striving to deliver the timber to the construction sites faster.

    战斗在深山、小河
    江西遂川县木材蕴藏量达八百多万立方公尺。全县今年计划生产木材九万一千多立方公尺，比去年增加了48％。大部分木材都在偏远林区砍伐，采伐和运输比往年更加艰巨。遂川县的森林工人发挥了革命干劲，在砍伐的日子里，天刚麻麻亮就提着工具上山，整天战斗在山岗，一直干到晚上才回家。掮运工人在上望不到山巅，下看不见谷底的山腰上往返穿梭；还在井冈山陡峭的山岩石壁上用木材扎上悬空桥，巧妙地从上面把木材一根一根运往小溪。水运工人在放运期间不分白天黑夜，撑着木排穿过礁石交错的河床，争取更快地把木材送到建筑工地去。
