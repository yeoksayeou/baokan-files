Under the Banner of Internationalism
    ——An Interview with Heromatko, Commander of the International Brigade
    Dōng Shēng

Forty years ago, there was a Red International Brigade fighting on the Ural front. Russians, Chinese, Koreans, Hungarians, Austrians, under the banner of internationalism, lived and died together, fighting side by side to defend the Soviet Republic.

Heromatko, the commander of the International Brigade, now lives in the city of Perm in the Soviet Union. This 75-year-old Hungarian man is happy and talkative. He told us about the International Brigade. He said:

“I am the son of a stonemason, graduated from the Faculty of Law of Budapest University, and worked as a lawyer. Later, I was drafted into the army and participated in the First World War. In 1915, I was captured by the Russian army. In a factory in the Urals, I met the Russian Bolshevik Sergeyev, who guided me towards the revolution and introduced me to the Communist Party.

"In early 1918, the International Brigade was established in Yekaterinburg (now Sverdlovsk), and I was appointed as the brigade commander. Our brigade was under the command of the International Column of the Red Army's Third Army. The commander of the column was Ferenc Munnich (the current Prime Minister of Hungary). At that time, there were many Hungarians in the Red Army. István Dobi (the current Chairman of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic) also fought the White bandits here.

"The International Brigade had more than 500 people, mostly Chinese, Koreans, and Hungarians. Russian was our common language. Few of the soldiers understood Russian, but they often gathered together and talked with various gestures and expressions.

"Our first combat mission was to eliminate the wealthy peasant bandit gangs. The cunning bandits hid in the forests, and if you weren't careful, you'd get shot by them. I remember once, a few soldiers were passing through a clearing in the forest near Komovis Village, when suddenly, bullets flew out of the bushes, and two Chinese soldiers were wounded. Another Chinese immediately returned fire. He was standing and shooting, and the bandits were aiming at him. At this moment, a Russian soldier suddenly pushed the Chinese down, lay on top of him, and took the enemy's bullets. The Russian sacrificed himself, and the Chinese soldier continued to fight until reinforcements arrived.

"A few days later, we cooperated with friendly forces to attack Qingke'en Village. The White Army's artillery fire was very fierce, especially a machine gun, which made it impossible for us to raise our heads. I was worried when I suddenly saw two soldiers crawling forward. One was Chinese, and he soon sacrificed himself. The other was Hungarian, named Imre Kabos. He used a tree branch as cover and slowly crawled forward. I ordered to open fire on the enemy to cover his advance. Soon, I saw Kabos jump up and throw grenades one after another. We rushed forward and occupied the enemy's position. Kabos also sacrificed himself.

"At dusk, the enemy counterattacked fiercely. A bloody battle began. Overnight, the position changed hands nine times. Our numbers were dwindling, and ammunition was especially scarce. A dozen Koreans and Chinese crawled to the bodies of enemy soldiers to collect bullets under a hail of bullets. We fought bitterly there for five days and five nights, and finally had to retreat. We buried our comrades' bodies on the banks of the Kern River, wading across the river in the cold November wind, and retreated towards Kern Station.

"The soldiers endured hunger and carried their wounded comrades, walking forward wearily. They had no food, and ate horse meat every day to satisfy their hunger. Farmers along the way gave us some bread, but everyone was polite and refused to eat. Later, I had to deal with this matter myself. I ordered everyone to take a bite in turn, and leave the rest for the wounded.

"In December 1918, the brigade was ordered to cover the Red Army's retreat. In a battle, I was shot and wounded and lost consciousness. The soldiers took turns carrying me and took me to the hospital. Since then, I left the team.

"The civil war ended. I settled down in the Soviet Union. In 1924, near the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, two Hungarians and two Chinese immediately recognized me. They turned out to be soldiers of the International Brigade. We embraced warmly like brothers. ...Ah, I will never forget the International Brigade, never forget the brotherly friendship that was solidified with blood." (Attached picture)

    在国际主义的旗帜下
    ——访国际大队队长赫罗马特柯
    东生
    四十年前，有一支红色国际大队，战斗在乌拉尔前线。俄国人、中国人、朝鲜人、匈牙利人、奥地利人，在国际主义的旗帜下，出生入死，并肩为保卫苏维埃共和国而战。
    国际大队队长赫罗马特柯，如今住在苏联的贝尔姆城里，这位七十五岁的匈牙利老人，快乐、健谈。他向我们谈起了国际大队。他说：
    “我是石匠的儿子，在布达佩斯大学法律系毕业，当过律师。后来被抓去当兵，参加了第一次世界大战。1915年，我被俄军俘虏。在乌拉尔的工厂里，我认识了俄国布尔什维克谢尔盖耶夫，他引导我走向革命，介绍我参加了共产党。
    “1918年初，在叶卡杰林堡（今为斯维德洛夫斯克城）成立了国际大队，我被任命为大队长。我们大队归红军第三军国际纵队指挥，纵队司令是费伦茨·明尼赫（现任匈牙利总理）。当时，红军里有很多匈牙利人，伊斯特万·道比（现任匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席）也在这儿打过白匪。
      “国际大队有五百多人，多数是中国人，朝鲜人，匈牙利人。俄文是我们的共同语言。战士们中间懂俄文的很少，可是，他们常常聚在一起，用各种手势和表情来谈话。
      “我们的第一个战斗任务，是消灭富农匪帮。狡猾的土匪藏在森林里，一不小心，就要吃他们的冷枪。记得有一次，几个战士经过柯莫维斯村附近一块林中空地，突然，从灌木丛里飞来了子弹，两个中国士兵负了伤。另一个中国人，立刻开枪还击。他是站着打的，匪徒们正向他瞄准。这时，一个俄罗斯战士，猛一下把中国人按倒，伏在他身上，接受了敌人的子弹。俄罗斯人牺牲了，中国战士继续战斗，直等援军赶到。
    “过了几天，我们配合友军攻打轻克恩村。白军的炮火非常厉害，尤其是一挺机关枪，打得我们头都抬不起来。我正在发愁，忽然看见两个战士向前爬动。一个是中国人，他很快就牺牲了。另一个是匈牙利人，叫伊姆雷·卡包斯，他用一根树枝作掩护，慢慢向前爬。我命令向敌人开火，掩护他前进。不一会，只见卡包斯一跃而起，手榴弹一颗接着一颗扔了出去。我们飞奔向前，占领了敌人的阵地。卡包斯也牺牲了。
    “黄昏，敌人凶恶地反扑过来。开始了一场血战。一夜之间，阵地九次易手。我们人数越来越少，子弹尤其缺乏。十几个朝鲜人和中国人，在枪林弹雨中，爬到敌军尸体跟前去搜集子弹。在那里，我们苦战了五天五夜，最后不得不退了下来。我们把同伴们的尸体埋葬在克恩河边，冒着11月的寒风，涉水过河，退向克恩车站。
    “战士们忍饥挨饿，抬着受伤的伙伴，疲惫不堪地向前走，没有吃的，每天用马肉充饥。沿路农民送给我们一些面包，但是大家互相谦让，谁也不肯吃。后来，我不得不亲自处理这件事。我下令每人轮流啃一口，剩下的全留给伤员。
    “1918年12月，大队奉命掩护红军退却。在一次战斗中，我中弹负伤，失去了知觉。战士们轮流抬着我，把我送到医院。从此，我就离开了队伍。
    “内战结束了。我在苏联安了家。1924年，在莫斯科大剧院附近，两个匈牙利人和两个中国人一下认出了我，原来他们是国际大队的战士。我们像兄弟一般，热烈地拥抱起来。……啊，我永远忘不了国际大队，忘不了那用鲜血凝结的兄弟友谊。”（附图片）
