    Shepherd's purse is one of the famous wild vegetables of spring. It is inexpensive, delicious, and has high nutritional content. There are many ways to eat it. Here, we only introduce one type: "Shepherd's Purse and Tofu Soup." The method is: wash the shepherd's purse clean and chop it finely, put it in a hot oil wok and stir-fry it, add water (the amount depends on whether you like the soup thicker or thinner), bring it to a boil, then add diced soft tofu, simmer it slightly, add salt, and then pour in water chestnut flour mixed with cold water. Stir evenly in the pot, and when the soup becomes thick, scoop it up and it's ready.

    荠菜豆腐羹
    荠菜，是春天著名的野菜之一，价廉，味美，而且营养成份高。吃法很多，这里只介绍一种“荠菜豆腐羹”，做法：把荠菜洗净切细，放进油锅炒一炒，加水（量多少根据自己爱吃汤汁的厚或薄确定），煮开，再放进切成小块的南豆腐，略煮一下，加盐，再倒进用冷水调好的菱粉，在锅内调匀，等汤汁变浓时盛起即成。
