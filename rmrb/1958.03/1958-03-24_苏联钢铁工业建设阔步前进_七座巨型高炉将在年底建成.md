    Soviet Steel Industry Construction Strides Forward
    Seven Giant Blast Furnaces to be Completed by Year's End
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent, March 23) The Soviet steel industry is making great strides in construction. The seven giant blast furnaces, the construction of which began in January this year, will all be completed by the end of the year. This scale and speed of construction are unprecedented. At the same time, to cooperate with the production of the new blast furnaces, a series of new iron mines, powerful open-hearth furnaces and rolling mills are also being built throughout the Soviet Union.
    This year, the Soviet Union's investment in iron ore mining reached 12.1 billion rubles, an increase of 35% compared to last year. The annual output of iron sand will increase by 10.14 million tons. More than 5 million tons of this will be produced in Ukraine, more than 3 million tons in the Russian Republic, and the rest in Kazakhstan. The first newly built iron mine in Kazakhstan is already producing ore in large quantities, and the new Kursk iron mine will also begin production within the year.
    To support the large-scale steel construction projects, hundreds of thousands of young people across the Soviet Union have organized shock brigades to actively participate in construction at various sites. For example, in the next two years, 28,000 members of the Komsomol and young people will go to participate in the construction of the Karaganda steel industrial enterprise, the third steel industrial base being built in the Soviet Union.

    苏联钢铁工业建设阔步前进
    七座巨型高炉将在年底建成
    本报莫斯科23日电　苏联钢铁工业建设工程正在大踏步前进。今年1月开始建筑的七座巨型高炉到年底将全部建成。这种建设规模和速度是前所未有的。同时，为了配合新高炉的生产，一系列的新铁矿、强大的平炉和轧钢厂，也分别在全苏各地兴建着。
    今年苏联在开采铁矿方面的投资达一百二十一亿卢布，即比去年增加了35％。全年将多产铁砂一千零十四万吨。其中有五百多万吨产于乌克兰，三百多万吨产于俄罗斯共和国，其他则产于哈萨克斯坦。在哈萨克斯坦新建的第一个铁矿已经在大批生产矿砂，库尔斯克新铁矿也将于年内开始生产。
    为了支援大规模的钢铁建设工程，苏联各地成千上万的青年已纷纷组织突击队，前往各工地积极参加建设。例如，今明两年内将有两万八千名共青团员和青年前去正在兴建中的全苏第三个钢铁工业基地——卡拉干达钢铁工业企业参加建设。
