Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 21st - According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, Czechoslovak Premier Široký announced at a meeting of agricultural activists on the 20th that about 80% of the rural areas in the country have now established cooperatives, and the number of Unified Agricultural Cooperatives has increased to more than 11,350.

Premier Široký spoke at this meeting held in Olomouc, central Czechoslovakia.

Široký also said that under the conditions in Czechoslovakia, machine tractor stations will continue to play their role in the future. The government will gradually supply the Unified Agricultural Cooperatives with the best machinery needed for their daily work. In this regard, the government has already taken measures.

In his speech, Široký also pointed out that the state's comprehensive and huge assistance to agriculture has played a positive role not only in increasing agricultural production, but also in increasing the income of residents and strengthening and expanding agricultural cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 23rd - Czechoslovakia is working hard to improve agricultural operations in the mountainous and hilly areas, which account for one-third of all agricultural land. The national conference of agricultural workers held here recently discussed this issue.

Unearthing the potential of the undulating border areas is of particular significance for solving an important problem in Czechoslovak agriculture—livestock breeding—as well as milk production.

According to the instructions of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, starting in 1958, these areas will gradually make livestock breeding the main production sector. To this end, these areas will vigorously increase the productivity and utilization rate of grasslands and pastures. At the same time, due to the lack of manpower and fertilizer in the border areas, potatoes and industrial crops, as well as feed crops and grains that can be harvested by machines, will mainly be planted there.

According to the instructions of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, with the help of machinery, it is possible to expand the cultivated area by 10% in mountainous and hilly areas.

    捷80％农村已建立合作社
    将努力改善山区和丘陵农业经营
    新华社布拉格21日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基20日在一次农业工作者积极分子会议上宣布，目前，全国约有80％的农村已经建立了合作社，统一农业合作社的数目已经增加到一万一千三百五十多个。
    西罗基总理在捷克斯洛伐克中部阿罗木次市举行的这个会议上讲了话。
    西罗基还说，在捷克斯洛伐克的条件下，机器拖拉机站今后还要发挥它的作用。政府将逐步供应统一农业合作社日常工作中所需要的最好的机器。在这方面，政府已经采取了措施。
    西罗基在讲话中还指出，国家对农业的全面和巨大的援助，不仅对增加农业生产，并且对提高居民的收入、加强和扩大农业合作社都起了良好的作用。
    新华社布拉格23日电　捷克斯洛伐克正在努力改善占全部农业土地三分之一的山区和丘陵地带的农业经营，不久以前在这里举行的农业工作者全国代表会议讨论了这个问题。
    发掘丘陵起伏的边境地区的潜力，对于解决捷克斯洛伐克农业中的重要问题——牲畜饲养——以及奶类生产具有特殊意义。
    根据捷共中央政治局的指示，从1958年起，这些地区将逐渐做到以牲畜饲养为主要生产部门。为此，这些地区将大力提高草地和牧场的生产力和利用率。同时，由于边境地区人力和肥料缺乏，那里将主要种植马铃薯和工业作物，以及可利用机器收割的饲料作物和谷物。
    根据捷共中央政治局的指示，依靠机器的帮助，山区和丘陵地带有可能扩大耕地面积10％。
