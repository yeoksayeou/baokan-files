In the past, under the feudal dynasties where men were superior to women, people believed that women certainly possessed the talent to be top scorers. Now, it is not only an era where every field produces top scorers, but also an era where both men and women equally produce top scorers. In recent years, there have been many female top scorers emerging on various fronts such as industrial and agricultural production and cultural education. Today, as we celebrate "March 8th," we wish all the women active on various fronts "Every field can produce a female top scorer!" The new situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward not only requires more female top scorers but also creates more conditions for every field to produce female top scorers. We hope that women, whether they are operating machines, wielding hoes, using pens, nurturing the next generation, or engaged in household labor, can seize the opportunity and strive to be the best.

Now, whether in factories or rural areas, in offices or schools, families, or in any place, you can see the moving scene of women catching up with and surpassing the advanced. Several female spinning workers in Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 5 roused the ambition of "I want to surpass her" and surpassed Chen Guiying, a municipal labor model in their factory, in two weeks. Now they are accelerating their pace to catch up with Huang Baomei, a national labor model. Ni Haibao, a weaving expert in Shanghai State Cotton Mill No. 9, was someone that nobody dared to compete with in the past. This time, thirteen girls suddenly emerged, aiming to catch up with her within half a year. When Jiangdu County Xiejin Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangsu Province was building water conservancy projects, many male members thought that the quota of six cubic meters of earth per person per day was too high, but the women's shock brigade averaged seven cubic meters of earth per person.

Not only in industry and agriculture but also in commerce and transportation, in office work, medical and health care, cultural education, military logistics, service industries, as well as in eliminating the four pests, afforestation, public security, practicing diligence and thrift in managing households, and other aspects, women have shown amazing strength and wisdom, created many miracles, and produced many female top scorers. In particular, many women have realized from their own practice that it is not enough to have enthusiasm alone; they also need to learn culture and technology to become both red and expert.

Learning culture and technology is necessary for every worker. When the socialist transformation of ownership has been completed in our country, and the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts has basically achieved victory, the most important task for the people of the whole country is to carry out socialist construction. To build, we must have culture and technology, and we must have skills. Without culture and technology, relying solely on enthusiasm, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and the Yangtze River Bridge cannot be built; and grain and cotton will certainly not yield thousands or hundreds of catties per mu. With technology, with skills, and with enthusiasm, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, whether male or female, young or old, we all need to work hard to learn technology. For women, learning technology is even more urgent. After liberation, the state has opened up vast fields for women to participate in labor and learning, and women themselves have also worked very hard, but they still cannot keep up with the actual needs, and their cultural and technical levels are still very low. At the same time, women, due to physiological limitations, generally have less physical strength than men and are not suitable for heavy physical labor. If women want to build socialism alongside men, they certainly cannot compete in labor intensity, but they can compete in creativity and initiative in labor. This requires even greater efforts to learn technology and practice skills.

While learning culture and technology, women must also strive to learn politics. With technology but without politics, there is no soul, and one will become a pragmatist who has lost direction. Moreover, without politics, it is difficult to learn technology well, because one loses the original driving force to overcome difficulties and forge ahead. Similarly, when learning culture and technology, some women can break through numerous difficulties and persevere, while others waver and retreat in the face of difficulties. The key lies in whether or not they have politics. In other words, it lies in whether or not they have a high degree of socialist consciousness.

For women to learn politics and technology, and to strive to be female top scorers, on the one hand, they must rely on their own efforts, hard work, and diligent study. On the other hand, they also need organization and leadership. Party committees at all levels should lead relevant units and technical departments, pay attention to implementing the policy of mobilizing both men and women together, frequently educate and encourage women to participate in political, cultural, and technical learning, and help women remove various obstacles in learning so that women can leap forward together with men. However, party committees at all levels can only provide relatively principled leadership, and specific work still needs to be undertaken by women's federations at all levels. For women's federations and women cadres to do this, they need to arouse revolutionary enthusiasm, eliminate bureaucratic airs, stagnation, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, change their leadership style and working methods, and lead the broad masses of women to leap forward together. In this regard, the example of women cadres in Macheng County, Hubei Province, engaging in "experimental plots" is a very good example. The women cadres in this county actively responded to the county party committee's call and participated in "experimental plots." Now, most areas have achieved the goal of having women's experimental groups in every cooperative and women's experimental plots in every team. By engaging in experimental plots, the women cadres in this county changed their leadership methods and their work style became more in-depth and more pragmatic. Zhang Yanhai, director of the Mingshan Township Women's Federation, through engaging in experimental plots, participated in production and led production, set an example in learning technology, and then held on-site meetings, which powerfully promoted the engagement of women throughout the township in experimental plots. Under this influence, a new atmosphere of diligence and frugality appeared among the local women. Therefore, the masses trusted and supported them even more.

To be a female top scorer, one must rely on women's own hard work and study, but also needs support and care from all aspects of society. Our era is an era of women's liberation, and the difficult conditions for women to participate in labor and learning have generally been overcome. However, to leap forward and fight hard, there will inevitably be some new difficulties. For example, one must both work hard and manage the family; both study professional skills and educate children, and so on. Women themselves must overcome these difficulties with revolutionary spirit, and the Women's Federation must also provide assistance. At the same time, it is hoped that all relevant parties will enthusiastically care for and support women in overcoming these difficulties, rather than standing by indifferently, or satirizing them, or discriminating against them. In the Great Leap Forward, every unit should not only strive to produce top scorers in their own unit but also strive to produce female top scorers. Let striving to be a female top scorer and cultivating female top scorers become a torrent in the high tide of our all-round Great Leap Forward!

### 行行都出女状元

    行行都出女状元
    在过去男尊女卑的封建王朝里，人们就认为妇女中确有状元之才。现在，不但是行行出状元的时代，也是男女同样出状元的时代。几年来，在工农业生产和文化教育等各个战线上出现的女状元，已经不少了。今天欣逢“三八”，我们愿以“行行都出女状元”预祝活跃在各个战线上的妇女们！全面大跃进的新形势不但要求出更多的女状元，而且为行行都出女状元创造了更多的条件。愿妇女们，不论是开机器的、拿锄头的、动笔杆的、抚育后一代的，或者从事家务劳动的，都能不失良机，奋力夺魁。
    现在无论在工厂还是农村，在机关还是学校、家庭，在任何一个场所，都可以看到妇女赶先进、比先进的动人情景。上海国棉五厂的几个挡车女工，鼓起了“我要赶过她”的雄心，两个星期就赶过了本厂的市级劳动模范陈桂英，现在又快马加鞭地追赶全国劳模黄宝妹。上海国棉九厂的织布能手倪海宝，过去谁也不敢和她比高低，这次，一下子就跑出来十三个姑娘，要在半年内赶上她。江苏省江都县协进农业社在兴修水利时，许多男社员都认为每人一天打六方土的指标太高，但妇女突击组却每人平均打了七方土。
    不只在工业和农业方面，在商业和交通运输方面，在机关工作、医药卫生、文化教育、军事后勤、服务行业及除四害、绿化、治安、勤俭持家等各方面，妇女都显出了惊人的力量和智慧，创造了不少奇迹，涌现了不少女状元。特别是有许多妇女已经从自己的实践中，认识到光有干劲不行，还需要学习文化学习技术，使自己成为又红又专的人。
    学文化、学技术，对于每一个劳动者来说，都是必需的。在我国所有制方面的社会主义改造已经完成，思想战线上、政治战线上的社会主义革命已经基本上取得胜利的时候，全国人民最重大的任务，就是进行社会主义建设。要设建，就得要有文化有技术，要有本领。没有文化、技术，光凭干劲，宝成铁路、长江大桥是修不起来的；粮食、棉花，也决不会亩产千斤、百斤。有了技术，有了本领，再加上干劲，就可以收事半功倍之效。因此，不论是男的还是女的，不论是青年还是老年，都需要努力学习技术。而对于妇女来说，学习技术更加迫切。解放后，国家给妇女参加劳动和学习开辟了广阔的天地，妇女本身也很努力，但仍然赶不上实际的需要，文化水平、技术水平都还很差。同时，妇女由于生理条件的限制，一般体力都不如男子，不适于从事较重的体力劳动。妇女要和男子并肩建设社会主义，比劳动强度当然不行，但是可以比劳动中的创造性和主动精神。这就必须更加努力学习技术、练好本领。
    妇女在学习文化、学习技术的同时，还必须努力学习政治。光有技术，没有政治，就没有灵魂，就会成为一个迷失方向的实际家。而且，没有政治要学好技术也很困难，因为丧失了战胜困难、奋勇前进的原动力。同样是学文化、学技术，有些妇女能够冲破重重困难坚持下去，有些妇女却在困难面前动摇、退却，这中间的关键就在于有没有政治。换句话说，就在于有没有高度的社会主义觉悟。
    妇女要学习政治、学习技术，要争取当女状元，一方面固然要靠妇女本身的努力，苦干、苦钻，另一方面也需要有组织、有领导。各级党委要领导各有关单位和技术部门，注意贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，经常教育和鼓励妇女参加政治、文化、技术学习，帮助妇女扫除学习中的种种障碍，使妇女能够和男子一同跃进。但是，各级党委只能作比较原则的领导，具体工作还需要各级妇联组织担当起来。妇联组织、妇女干部要做到这一点，就需要鼓起革命干劲，打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气，改变自己的领导作风和工作方法，领导广大妇女一起向前跃进。在这方面，湖北省麻城县妇女干部搞“试验田”的事情，就是一个很好的榜样。这个县的妇女干部，积极响应县委号召，人人参加搞“试验田”，现在大部分地区已经做到社社有妇女试验组，队队有妇女试验田。通过搞试验田，这个县的妇女干部改变了领导方法，工作作风更加深入、更加踏实了。明山乡妇联主任张延怀通过搞试验田，做到参加生产、领导生产，自己在学习技术上做出样子，再召开现场会议，这样就有力地推动了全乡妇女搞试验田。在这个影响下面，当地妇女中出现了勤劳俭朴的新风气。因此，群众对她们更加信赖、更加拥护了。
    要当女状元，要靠妇女自己苦干苦学，也需要社会上各方面的支援和关怀。我们的时代是妇女获得解放的时代，妇女参加劳动、学习的困难条件一般地说已经克服了。可是，要跃进，要苦战，就不免还会有一些新的困难。比如，既要苦干又要治家；既要钻研业务，又要教养子女等等。这些困难，妇女本身要用革命精神去克服，妇联也要给以帮助，同时还希望各个有关方面要热情地关怀和支援妇女克服这些困难，而不要冷眼旁观，或者讽刺她们、歧视她们。每一个单位，在大跃进中不但要争取自己单位里能出状元，而且要争取能出女状元。让争取做女状元、培养女状元，成为我们全面大跃进的高潮中的一股巨流！
