Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: According to TASS, New York, March 25th: The Soviet Mission to the United Nations issued a statement on the 25th, saying: Some messages published in American newspapers recently distort the Soviet attitude towards resuming disarmament negotiations. These messages are based on the US State Department's statement of March 15th this year and recent remarks made by officials of the US Mission to the United Nations.

The statement pointed out that these statements and talks by the US government deliberately and irresponsibly linked the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement of March 14th with the negotiations conducted by Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, and US Representative Wadsworth in March. The reports about these negotiations that appeared in the American newspapers were by no means initiated by the Soviet side.

(Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: The US State Department's statement on the 15th insisted that the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the 14th regarding disarmament issues "casts doubt on whether the Soviet Union hopes to conduct serious discussions on disarmament issues," and the so-called argument for this "doubt" is that the Soviet Union published its statement before the Sobolev and Wadsworth negotiations.)

The statement said that the Soviet Mission to the United Nations is not prepared to comment on the substance of the US State Department's statement of March 15th and the remarks made by the US Representative to the United Nations, but believes it is necessary to state the circumstances of deliberate distortion of the truth.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement of March 14th was based on many messages that had already appeared in foreign newspapers, especially reports from American news agencies, even before the Sobolev and Wadsworth negotiations began. It clarified the Soviet government's principled and consistent attitude towards the resumption of negotiations and the ways and realistic possibilities of resolving the disarmament issue, and assessed the US plan to convene a meeting of the Disarmament Committee and submit the disarmament issue to the Security Council for discussion. The purpose of this Soviet statement was to clarify the Soviet government's views on these plans and to foresee that the procedures proposed by the United States would not be conducive to creating conditions for realistically studying and resolving the most pressing disarmament issues.

The statement said that it can be clearly seen from these facts that the US State Department's attempt to confuse the statement issued by the Soviet Foreign Ministry with the secret negotiations conducted by Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, and US Representative Wadsworth is completely untenable, and the purpose of doing so is only to divert public attention from the substance of the issue.

    苏联驻联合国代表团声明
    斥美国歪曲苏联对裁军态度
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社纽约25日讯：苏联驻联合国代表团25日发表声明说：近来美国报纸发表的一些消息歪曲了苏联对待恢复裁军谈判的态度。这些消息是以美国国务院今年3月15日的声明和美国驻联合国代表团官方人士近来发表的谈话为根据的。
    声明指出，美国政府这些声明和谈话故意不负责任地硬把苏联外交部3月14日的声明同苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫和美国代表华兹沃斯在3月里进行的谈判联系起来。美国报纸上出现关于这次谈判的报道决不是由于苏联方面的主动。
      （新华社编者按：美国国务院15日的声明硬说苏联外交部14日关于裁军问题的声明“使人怀疑苏联是否希望就裁军问题进行认真的讨论”，而作为这个“怀疑”的论据就是所谓在索波列夫和华兹沃斯谈判前，苏联就公布了它的声明。）
    声明说，苏联驻联合国代表团不准备评论美国国务院3月15日的声明和美国驻联合国代表的谈话的实质，但是认为有必要申明其中故意歪曲事实真相的情况。
    苏联外交部3月14日的声明，是以还在索波列夫和华兹沃斯谈判开始以前就出现在外国报纸，特别美国通讯社报道中的许多消息为依据的。它阐明了苏联政府对恢复谈判和解决裁军问题的途径和现实的可能性的问题所采取的原则性的一贯的态度，并且对美国关于召开裁军委员会会议和把裁军问题提交安全理事会讨论的计划作了估价。苏联这个声明的目的在于阐明苏联政府对于这些计划的观点，并且预示：美国拟定的程序对于创造条件以便实事求是地研究和解决最迫切的裁军问题不会有什么好处。
    声明说，从这些事实中可以明显地看出，美国国务院硬要把苏联外交部所发表的声明同苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫和美国代表华兹沃斯所进行的秘密谈判混淆在一起的做法是完全站不住脚的，这样做的目的只是想转移公众对问题实质的注意。
