Irrigation Methods Need Improvement
　　Head of Jinghui Canal Management Bureau Discusses Management Experience

    (Our report) How to rationally use water and fully utilize the irrigation efficiency of water conservancy projects is an important issue in current agricultural production. Recently, a reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Jinghui Canal Management Bureau of Shaanxi Province, who has irrigation management experience, on this issue.

    The person in charge said that in newly built irrigation areas, farmers have suffered from drought for a long time in the past. Now, when they have the opportunity to irrigate, they are likely to over-irrigate regardless of actual needs. This not only wastes water, but also damages the land. In 1952, the cotton production in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area was reduced because farmers used large-scale flooding irrigation for a long time, which caused the groundwater level to rise generally, and more than 50,000 mu of low-lying land became swampy and salinized. This serious lesson is worth the attention of new irrigation areas across the country.

    How to achieve rational irrigation? The person in charge pointed out that first, it is necessary to establish and improve water conservancy organizations and systems in the irrigation area. Agricultural cooperatives should set up water conservancy shares, train farmer water conservancy technicians, and lead the watering team to take specific responsibility for irrigation management. It is advocated that the upstream takes care of the downstream. When releasing water, it should be done from bottom to top, from left to right, in turn, day and night. At the same time, it is also necessary to always pay attention to leveling the land, improving the field canal network, repairing canal banks and ridges, and reducing water waste such as breaches and water leakage.

    The person in charge said that the main key to improving irrigation efficiency lies in improving irrigation methods. Since 1953, Jinghui Canal has implemented "three reforms": 1. Change flooding irrigation to furrow irrigation; 2. Change large-plot irrigation to small-plot irrigation; 3. Change late spring irrigation to early spring irrigation. The practice in recent years has proved that furrow irrigation has the greatest benefit, saving half the amount of water compared to large-plot flooding irrigation. At the same time, it also shortens the watering cycle and allows for timely and appropriate water use. The moisture during furrow irrigation mostly slowly soaks into the soil, preventing the ground from becoming compacted and nutrients from being lost, which is beneficial to the growth of seedlings. For densely planted crops such as wheat and millet that cannot implement furrow irrigation, the method of changing wide plots to narrow plots and long plots to short plots is adopted, so that the irrigation quota is also reduced by about 30% compared to large-plot flooding irrigation. In order to store water and conserve moisture, and to ensure the early sowing of cotton, late spring irrigation is changed to early spring irrigation, which is conducive to the distribution of water in late spring and early summer.

    The person in charge suggested that large-scale canal irrigation in various places can also consider further adopting planned water use when conditions permit. He said that planned water use is to carry out planned water diversion and irrigation according to the water demand of crops and the changes in the amount of water in the river source. Before irrigation, the water-using units in the irrigation area should formulate a water-use plan, which is reviewed and approved by the canal management unit. If the river source water volume in the irrigation area is too small, the main and branch canals in the irrigation area can be divided into several groups for rotational irrigation, or water can be used in proportion, so that all parts of the irrigation area can receive a certain amount of irrigation benefits during the same period. During the rotational irrigation period, each agricultural cooperative can select crops that urgently need water for irrigation first according to the growth of local crops, or divide the crops into primary and secondary according to their economic value, and first meet the water demand of the main crops in order to fully exert the yield-increasing effect of irrigation.

### 灌溉方法要改进  泾惠渠管理局负责人谈管理经验

    灌溉方法要改进
    泾惠渠管理局负责人谈管理经验
    本报讯　如何合理用水，充分发挥水利工程的灌溉效能，这是当前农业生产中的一个重要问题。最近，记者就这个问题访问了具有灌溉管理经验的陕西省泾惠渠管理局的负责人。
    这位负责人说，在新建的灌溉区，农民们在过去长期遭受干旱的危害，现在遇到浇水机会，很可能不顾实际需要，超量灌溉。这样做，不仅费水，而且还会把土地浇坏。泾惠渠灌区1952年棉花减产就是因为农民长时期用大水漫灌，使地下水位普遍上升，五万多亩低洼地沼泽化、盐渍化。这个严重的教训，值得各地新灌区的重视。
    怎样做到合理灌溉呢？负责人指出，首先必须建立和健全灌溉区的水利组织和制度。农业社应该成立水利股，训练农民水利技术员，领导浇地队具体负责灌溉管理工作。提倡上游照顾下游，在放水时应由下而上，先左后右，依次昼夜轮浇。同时，还必须经常注意平整土地，健全田间渠系网，补修渠岸畦垅，减少决口、跑水等浪费水的现象。
    负责人说，提高灌溉效能的主要关键在于改进灌溉方法。1953年以来，泾惠渠实行了“三改”：一、改漫灌为沟灌；二、改大畦灌为小畦灌；三、改晚春灌为早春灌。几年来的实践证明，沟灌的效益最大，用水量比大畦漫灌要节省一半，同时，也缩短了浇水的轮期，能够适时适量的用水。沟灌时的水分，大部是慢慢浸润土壤，不至于使地面板结和养料流失，利于禾苗的生长。不能实行沟灌的密植作物如小麦，糜谷等，采取把宽畦改为窄畦，长畦改为短畦的办法，使灌水的定额也比大畦漫灌减少了30％左右。为了储水保墒，保证棉花的提前播种，把晚春灌改为早春灌，以利于春末夏初的水量分配。
    负责人建议各地的大型渠道灌溉，在条件许可的情况下，还可以考虑进一步采用计划用水。他说，计划用水就是根据作物的需水情况和河源水量大小的变化，进行有计划的引水和灌溉。在灌溉前，灌区的用水单位要制定出用水计划，由渠道管理单位审核批准。如果灌区的河源水量过小，可以把灌区的干、支渠分成几组轮流灌溉，或者按比例用水，使灌区各地在同时期内都能受到一定的灌溉利益。在轮灌时期内，各农业社可根据当地作物生长的情况，选择需水较急的作物先行灌溉，或是按照作物的经济价值，分出主、次，首先满足主要作物的需水要求，以充分发挥灌溉的增产效能。
