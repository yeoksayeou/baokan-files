    The Polish chemical industry's synthetic products exhibition was recently held at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. The image above shows a striking exhibit at the exhibition, a massive piece of foam insulation material, larger in volume than a person, yet weighing only half a kilogram. The Polish chemical industry has made considerable progress since World War II. Poland ranks eighth in the world in terms of chemical industrial output. This is partly due to Poland's abundant raw material resources: coal, rock salt, sulfur, limestone, pyrite, and gypsum, and partly due to the increasing demand for chemical products from other industrial sectors, agriculture, and people's lives. This industrial sector in Poland has an average annual production growth of 21%. The five-year plan from 1956 to 1960 will usher in a new stage of development for the chemical industry. Many new factories, such as the Janikowo Soda Factory and the Kędzierzyn Nitrate Factory, will be put into production, and the variety of products will also be greatly increased. By the end of this year, 132 new products will be manufactured. (Attached picture)

    日益增长的化学工业
    最近在华沙文化科学宫举行了波兰化学工业的合成品展览会。上图是展览会的一件引人注目的展品，这是一块巨大的泡沫绝缘材料，体积比一个人还大，但重量仅有半公斤。波兰化学工业自第二次世界大战后迄今有了长足的发展。在世界化学工业产量中，波兰名列第八。这一方面是由于波兰拥有丰富的原料资源：煤、岩盐、硫磺、石灰石、黄铁矿和石膏等，一方面是其他工业部门、农业和人民生活对化学产品日增的需要。波兰这一工业部门平均每年生产增长21％。1956年到1960年的五年计划将使化学工业的发展进入一个新阶段。许多新工厂如亚尼库夫纯碱工厂和肯杰仁硝石工厂等将投入生产，而且品种也要大大增加，今年年底以前将制造出一百三十二种新产品。（附图片）
