Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: TASS reports that Soviet Supreme Soviet representative candidates, members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Aristov and Furtseva, and alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, Kirilenko, met with voters in their respective electoral districts on the 10th. They delivered speeches to the voters, discussing the great achievements and development prospects of the Soviet national economic construction, as well as the Soviet Union's foreign policy.

Aristov, during a meeting with voters in the Chelyabinsk-Lenin electoral district in Chelyabinsk, said that the Soviet Union's iron and steel industry had overfulfilled its production plan for the first quarter of this year. "The day is not far off when the Soviet Union will win the world championship in steel production and leave the United States behind." Aristov pointed out that the National Economic Councils established in various economic regions after the reorganization of industrial management will play a decisive role in the further smooth development of science and the practical application of scientific achievements.

Aristov also spoke about the Soviet Union's foreign policy. He pointed out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will continue to take all measures to shatter the aggressive plans of international reactionary forces and ensure the peaceful labor of the Soviet people who are building communism.

Furtseva is the representative candidate for the Kuibyshev electoral district in Moscow. In her speech to the voters, she particularly pointed out that in the past four years, the increase in electricity generation in the Soviet Union alone is almost equal to the average annual electricity generation of West Germany, Britain, or Canada.

Kirilenko, during a meeting with voters in the Kamensk-Uralsky electoral district of Sverdlovsk Oblast, focused on the construction achievements of Sverdlovsk Oblast. He said that Sverdlovsk Oblast has become a large economic region in the Soviet Union. The production of machinery, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and the mining of asbestos and bauxite in this oblast occupy a significant position in the Soviet Union. Kirilenko said that many collective farms in Sverdlovsk Oblast are now able to purchase all the agricultural machinery and equipment they need from the Machine and Tractor Stations, according to the decision of the February Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on the reorganization of Machine and Tractor Stations. And within two or three years, all collective farms in the oblast will be able to do this. He mentioned that the total number of television sets owned by residents of this oblast is now more than the combined total of television sets in Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Spain.

    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：第五届苏联最高苏维埃选举的准备工作现在已进入候选人同选民会见这一最后阶段。全国一千三百六十四个选区的代表候选人已经或者正在同选民举行会见。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人、苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、哈萨克共产党中央委员会第一书记别利亚耶夫9日在哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图会见了选民。苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人、苏共中央主席团委员、苏共中央书记伊格纳托夫8日在高尔基城会见了选民。3月7日，第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克和第聂伯罗捷尔任斯克的一千五百多名劳动人民代表在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克市同自己提出的代表候选人、苏共中央主席团候补委员、乌克兰共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席科罗特钦科会见。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人、苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员阿里斯托夫、福尔采娃和苏共中央主席团候补委员基里连科，10日分别在他们所属的选区会见了选民。他们向选民发表了演说，谈到了苏联国民经济建设的巨大成就和发展前景以及苏联的外交政策。
    阿里斯托夫在车里雅宾斯克市同车里雅宾斯克—列宁选区的选民会见时说，今年第一季度苏联的钢铁工业超额完成了生产计划。苏联“在钢产量上夺得世界冠军并把美国抛在后面的日子已经不远了。”阿里斯托夫指出，改组工业管理后在各经济区成立的国民经济委员会将对科学的进一步顺利发展和科学成果的实际应用起决定性的作用。
    阿里斯托夫还谈到了苏联的外交政策。他指出，苏联共产党一贯执行和平的对外政策，苏联共产党今后仍将继续采取一切措施来粉碎国际反动势力的侵略计划和保障正在建设共产主义的苏联人的和平劳动。
    福尔采娃是莫斯科古比雪夫选区的代表候选人。她在对选民发表演说时特别指出，四年来单是苏联增加的发电量就差不多等于西德、英国或者加拿大每年的平均发电量。
    基里连科同斯维德洛夫州卡明斯克—乌拉尔斯克选区的选民会见时着重谈到了斯维德洛夫州的建设成就。他说，斯维德洛夫州已经成为苏联的一个大经济区。这个州的机器生产、黑色金属和有色金属的生产、石棉和铝土矿的开采量在苏联占相当重要的地位。基里连科说，斯维德洛夫州有许多集体农庄现在就能够根据苏共中央二月全会关于改组机器拖拉机站的决议从机器拖拉机站购买它们所需要的全部农业机器和装备。而在两三年内，全州所有的集体农庄就都可以作到这一点。他提到，这个州的居民现在所有的电视机总数比瑞典、挪威、瑞士、西班牙几国的电视机加起来的总数还多。
