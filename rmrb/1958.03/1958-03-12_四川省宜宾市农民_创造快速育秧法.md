    Farmers in Yibin City, Sichuan Province
    Create Rapid Rice Seedling Method
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu—During the spring plowing and sowing season, farmers from two agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Yibin City, Sichuan Province, and staff members of the Yibin Special District Farm successively created three rapid rice seedling methods: oven seedling raising method, soil temperature bed seedling raising method, and stacked rapid seedling raising method. These methods can advance the transplanting time of early rice by more than half a month. These innovations have solved the crucial problem of ensuring early sowing and early transplanting of early rice for increased double-cropping rice production.
    The Yibin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting on March 3rd with the participation of county party secretaries from the entire special district to visit these three innovations. Everyone was excited to see that most of the early rice at these three locations had already been transplanted, and the seedlings were green and strong. They listened to introductions, looked at physical objects, and sometimes even experimented themselves. The more the meeting progressed, the higher the mood became.
    In the past, it usually took about a month to raise early rice seedlings here. With these innovations, the past rules have been broken. On the day of the on-site meeting, a decision was made to promote these three methods throughout the district, and agricultural cooperatives in various places would adopt them according to their own conditions. The meeting demanded that early rice in the entire district be transplanted before the end of March, which is earlier than in previous years. This would ensure that both early and late rice mature in high temperatures, greatly increasing yields.

    四川省宜宾市农民
    创造快速育秧法
    据新华社成都讯　春耕播种期间，四川省宜宾市郊区两个农业社的农民和宜宾专区农场职工连续创造了三种快速育秧法——烘箱育秧法、土温床育秧法、堆积快速育秧法——可以使早稻栽插时间提早半个月以上。这些创造，解决了双季稻增产必须保证早稻早播早栽的重要关键问题。
    中共宜宾地委3日举行了全专区县委书记参加的现场会议，参观了这三种创造。大家看到这三处早稻已大部栽完，秧苗青绿茁壮，都很兴奋。他们耳闻介绍、眼看实物，有时还动手试验，会越开情绪愈高。
    过去，这里早稻育秧时间一般都需一个月左右。有了这些创造，就打破了过去的规律。现场会议当天就做出决定，在全区推广这三种办法，由各地农业社根据自己条件采用。会议要求全区早稻都在3月底前栽秧，比往年提早一个季节，这样就可以保证早晚稻都在高气温中成熟，大大增加产量。
