    British Elderly Face Miserable Old Age
    In a slum in Glasgow, Britain, lived an elderly couple. The husband, David Sandys, had been bedridden for many years and completely relied on his wife for care. Not long ago, his wife suddenly fell ill and died. The old man, unable to obtain food, lay beside his wife's corpse and starved to death, with no one even knowing. It was not until recently that the police broke down the door and discovered that the two elderly people had been dead for a long time. Illustration by You Yunchang
