    One Fertilizer Plant per County, One Grain per Fertilizer Pellet
    Ministry of Chemical Industry Rushes to Produce Standard Designs for Small Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants
    (Our reporter Ye Jianyun reports) The Ministry of Chemical Industry, responding to the urgent need for chemical fertilizers in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, has put forward a plan to bring the fertilizer industry to the countryside, with fertilizer plants scattered like stars and blossoming in every county. According to this plan, they have formulated a four-level (central, provincial, special district, county) fertilizer plant plan. In order to quickly build fertilizer plants in 180 special districts and more than 2,000 counties across the country, the ministry is currently rushing to produce standard designs for special district-level and county-level fertilizer plants.
    The characteristics of county-level nitrogen fertilizer plants are: low investment, small footprint, short construction time, simple equipment, convenient operation, and raw materials that can be obtained locally. Generally, county towns or small towns have the conditions to build them. According to the requirements of the standard design, the total investment of this type of nitrogen fertilizer plant, including a 750 kW small power station, only requires 3.5 million yuan. With an average of 200,000 people per county, it would only cost 17.5 yuan per person to build the plant. This type of plant occupies about ten mu of land and takes only five to six months to build. It produces 8,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer (a mixed liquid fertilizer of ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate) annually, which can increase grain production by 48 million jin, equivalent to 3.36 million yuan; for cotton fields, it can increase cotton production by 8 million jin, worth 6.4 million yuan. The entire investment can be recovered in about a year. The main raw material required for this type of nitrogen fertilizer plant is air, which is inexhaustible; the second is coke, but in areas without coke, anthracite can also be used. In terms of water sources, areas close to rivers and lakes can use natural water sources; in water-scarce mountainous areas or in the north, well water can be used. Because many production processes have been simplified in this type of fertilizer plant, the operation is relatively simple, and workers who have undergone short-term training can master the operating techniques.
    The production capacity of a special district-level fertilizer plant is 40,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer (a mixed liquid fertilizer of ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate) per year. Although the factory scale is larger, the degree of automation and mechanization is still very low. The investment in this type of small fertilizer plant is about 10 million yuan (excluding the power station). From the perspective of investment and production capacity, this type of fertilizer plant is suitable for special districts to organize with the strength of several counties.
    The equipment required for the above-mentioned county-level and special district-level fertilizer plants is relatively simple, and most of it can be manufactured by the mechanical factories and iron factories in various provinces and cities themselves.
    The Ministry of Chemical Industry attaches great importance to the standard design of these two types of fertilizer plants. The famous chemist and Vice Minister of Chemical Industry, Hou Debang, personally serves as the leader of the design team. Most of the senior engineering and technical personnel of this ministry participated in this design work. Their working principle is: all measures must proceed from the specific conditions of the countryside and from the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Use wood where wood can be used, use bamboo where bamboo can be used; and manual labor should be used wherever possible, and machinery should never be used.
    It usually takes three months to design a nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 8,000 tons; this time, due to the designers' extremely high enthusiasm for supporting agriculture, they completed the design draft in only four days. At present, they are starting to run a nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons and several nitrogen fertilizer plants with an annual output of 8,000 tons in Beijing and Shanghai, in order to further accumulate experience.
    Using these standard designs to build fertilizer plants, even if a thousand counties are built, can produce 8 million tons of fertilizer. And the current national output is only hundreds of thousands of tons. After these fertilizer plants are built, they will not only strongly support agriculture, but also, because the power stations are built at the same time, will be conducive to the development of other local industries.

### 一县一个化肥厂  一粒化肥一颗粮  化学工业部赶制小型氮肥厂定型设计

    一县一个化肥厂  一粒化肥一颗粮
    化学工业部赶制小型氮肥厂定型设计
    本报讯  记者叶剑韵报道：化学工业部根据农业生产大跃进对化学肥料的迫切要求，经过紧急动员，提出了使化肥工业下乡、化肥厂星罗棋布、县县开花的方案。根据这个方案，他们已经制定了一个四级（中央、省、专区、县）化肥厂的规划。为了使全国一百八十个专区、两千多个县迅速建起化肥厂，这个部目前正在赶制专区级和县级肥料厂的定型设计。
    县级氮肥厂的特点是：投资少，占地面积不大，建厂时间短，设备简易，操作方便，原料基本上可以就地取材，一般县城或小市镇都有条件举办。按照定型设计的要求，这种氮肥厂的全部投资包括七百五十瓩的小型电站在内，只需要三百五十万元。以每县平均二十万人口计，每人只出十七点五元就可以把厂子办起来。这种厂占地约十亩，建厂时间只要五、六个月。它每年生产氮肥（炭酸氢铵和炭酸铵的混合液体肥料）八千吨，用于粮食作物可以增产四千八百万斤，折合三百三十六万元；用于棉田，可以增产皮棉八百万斤，值六百四十万元。一年左右就可收回全部投资。这种氮肥厂所需要的主要原料是取之不尽用之不竭的空气；其次是焦炭，没有焦炭的地区，还可以采用无烟煤。水源方面，靠近江河湖泊的地区，可以利用天然水源；在缺水的山区或北方，可以使用井水。这种肥料厂，由于许多生产过程简化了，操作起来比较简单，经过短时间的训练的工人，就可以掌握操作技术。
    专区级肥料厂，生产能力是年产氮肥（炭酸氢铵和炭酸铵的混合液体肥料）四万吨。工厂规模虽然大一些，但是自动化和机械化的程度同样很低。这种小型肥料厂的投资约在一千万元以内（不包括电站）。从投资情况和生产能力看，这种类型的肥料工厂适合于专区集中几个县的力量来举办。
    上述县级和专区级的化肥厂所需设备比较简单，绝大部分都可以由各省市的机械工厂、铁工厂自己制造。
    化学工业部对这两种类型肥料厂的定型设计十分重视。著名的化学家、化学工业部副部长侯德榜亲自担任设计组组长。这个部的大部分高级工程技术人员都参加了这项设计工作。他们工作的原则是：一切措施都要从农村的具体情况出发，从多快好省的建设方针出发。设备能用木料的就用木料，能用竹材的就用竹材；凡是可以采用手工劳动的，决不采用机械。
    年产八千吨的氮肥厂，通常需要设计三个月；这次设计师们由于支援农业的热情十分高涨，只花四天时间就完成了设计草图。目前，他们正着手在北京和上海两地，试办一个年产四万吨的氮肥厂和几个年产八千吨的氮肥厂，以便进一步积累经验。
    利用这些定型设计来修建化肥厂，即使有一千个县建成，也可以生产八百万吨化肥。而全国目前的产量才只有几十万吨。这些化肥厂建成以后，不仅将有力地支援农业，而且由于电站同时建成，还有利于发展其他地方工业。
