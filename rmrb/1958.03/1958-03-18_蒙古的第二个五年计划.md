    Mongolia's Second Five-Year Plan
    By our correspondent Feng Ye
    Spring returns to the earth, and the ice and snow begin to melt on the Mongolian grasslands. The Mongolian people have victoriously completed the second five-year plan (1953-1957) for socialist construction and are now welcoming the construction tasks of the first year of the new three-year plan. The socialist competition launched to greet the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has achieved good results.
    Animal husbandry, Mongolia's main economic sector, has greatly developed during the second five-year plan period. By September of last year, the number of livestock reached more than 24 million. During this period, Mongolia's animal husbandry also underwent socialist transformation and achieved significant development. According to figures released by the Mongolian State Planning Commission, by 1957, Mongolia already had more than 700 pastoral production cooperatives, an increase of more than 500 compared with the end of the first five-year plan. The number of herding households joining the cooperatives accounted for 35% of the total number of herding households, and the livestock accounted for 25%.
    Whether in the Khangai (mountainous) or Gobi regions, the cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority in business management and disaster resistance. For example, last year, due to snowstorms and drought, individual herders suffered losses of livestock due to their weak disaster resistance capabilities, while cooperatives increased livestock by an average of 2%. The cash and in-kind (meat, milk, etc.) income of cooperative members is also increasing. In 1957, the income per work day of cooperative members increased more than tenfold compared with 1953.
    Cooperatives have established sites on the grasslands, with schools, medical stations, and other organizations, and are engaged in agriculture and fodder cultivation, gradually creating conditions for the settlement of herdsmen. Cooperatives are attracting a large number of herdsmen. In the past two years, more than 100,000 herdsmen have joined cooperatives. According to Mongolia's long-term plan for developing cooperatives, 50% of herdsmen will be organized by 1960, and 42 cooperatives will be settled this year.
    State-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, an important sector of socialist agriculture and animal husbandry, have successfully completed their plans. The cultivated area has expanded more than threefold in the past five years, accounting for 60% of the country's cultivated area. The yields of grain, potatoes, and vegetables have increased by two to three times to more than tenfold, respectively. The number of livestock has also increased significantly.
    Agricultural production, which had developed slowly in the past, has developed rapidly during the second five-year plan period. The country's cultivated area reached more than 83,000 hectares. The output of grain and fodder has increased. Mongolian scientists are conducting experiments and research to improve crop varieties based on the characteristics of Mongolia's high-altitude and cold climate. Pear trees planted on the Mongolian grasslands have already yielded their first fruits, and we have also tasted watermelons grown on the grasslands in state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms. Mongolia's vast virgin land is boundless and dotted with many rivers and lakes, offering great prospects for the development of agriculture. Mongolia has planned to expand the cultivated area to more than 200,000 hectares by 1960.
    Mongolia's national industry is relatively young, and it began to be established and developed with the help of the Soviet Union, mainly the processing industry of animal products. During the second five-year plan period, Mongolia further expanded many of its original factories and enterprises. With the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, it also newly built porcelain, match, and soap factories and the Nalaikh coal mine shaft. The formerly Sino-Soviet joint venture in metallurgical and petroleum industries was transferred to Mongolian management in 1957 and overfulfilled its production plan for that year.
    The total industrial output value of the second five-year plan was completed in the first four years. In the past five years, the total industrial output increased by 69%. The output of major industries such as metallurgy, electricity, coal, felt, and leather has increased to varying degrees. The ranks of the working class have also gradually expanded, increasing by more than 6,000 in five years. The total number of workers in the country's industrial sector has reached more than 20,000.
    On the flat grasslands, the capital Ulaanbaatar and various provincial cities and important industrial and mining areas are connected by roads. A major event in transportation was the construction of the "Friendship Railway" from Ulaanbaatar to Zamyn-Üüd, which is more than 700 kilometers long, with the help of the Soviet Union. It is connected to the section originally leading to the Soviet border, running across Mongolia from north to south, and connected to the two major neighboring countries, China and the Soviet Union, at both ends. On January 1, 1956, the joint railway transportation of Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union was opened, further strengthening the fraternal friendly exchanges between the people of the three countries and strengthening Mongolia's foreign ties.
    During the second five-year plan, Mongolia has enrolled all school-age children in school. Before the victory of the revolution, Mongolia had only one primary school with dozens of students. Now, there are four universities, fifteen specialized schools, with thousands of students, and more than 430 middle and primary schools, with more than 90,000 students, exceeding the targets set by the second five-year plan.
    Mongolia's literary and art workers have made many achievements in literary and artistic creation with national characteristics and socialist content in the past five years. In 1957, writers produced more than 1,300 works, more than double the number at the beginning of the five-year plan. The Mongolian Writers Association requires writers to further delve into reality, connect with the masses, and write better and more works that reflect the lives of the working people. On the Mongolian art stage, we have not only seen Mongolian national songs and dances and dramas, but also many foreign masterpieces, such as Shakespeare's "Othello", the Czechoslovak masterpiece "The Magic Flute", and the Chinese opera "The White-Haired Girl". Due to the successful performances of Mongolian actors, they have been appreciated by the audience.
    The increase in the number of hospitals and beds in Mongolia in the past five years has exceeded the planned targets. Many measures taken by Mongolia in health care have gradually increased the net population growth rate, which has now reached 15.4 per thousand.
    With the development of Mongolia's socialist construction, the people's material and cultural life is gradually improving. In the past five years, people's deposits in banks have increased two and a half times. The main wealth of the vast number of herdsmen is livestock. The government has taken measures such as appropriately reducing livestock taxes and increasing the purchase prices of animal products based on the country's development, increasing the income of herdsmen. For example, the cash income of herdsmen in 1957 increased by 7.2% compared with 1956. Workers' wages have increased by 36% in the past four years.
    In the past five years, Mongolia's foreign relations have also developed significantly. It has successively established formal diplomatic relations with countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia. During this period, Mongolia sent thirteen art troupes to visit and perform in fraternal countries and France, and received dozens of foreign art troupes and people from cultural and scientific circles from various countries, promoting cultural exchanges between Mongolia and various countries. Mongolia's foreign trade relations have now expanded to all socialist countries, and it has also established trade relations with countries such as Egypt and Switzerland. The friendly relations between Mongolia and the people of all countries have been further developed.

    蒙古的第二个五年计划
    本报记者　逢烨
    春回大地，蒙古草原上冰雪开始消融。蒙古人民胜利地度过进行社会主义建设的第二个五年（1953—1957年），现正迎接着新的三年计划第一年的建设任务，为迎接蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会而展开的社会主义竞赛已取得很好的成绩。
    蒙古主要经济部门的畜牧业，在第二个五年计划期间，有了很大发展，到去年9月为止，牲畜头数达到二千四百多万头。这一期间，蒙古畜牧业也进行了社会主义改造，有了显著的发展。根据蒙古国家计划委员会公布的数字，到1957年，蒙古已经有七百多个牧业生产合作社，比第一个五年计划末，增加了五百多个。加入合作社的牧户占总牧户的35％，牲畜占25％。
    不论在杭爱（山岳）或是戈壁地区，合作社在经营管理或抗御自然灾害方面，都显示了它的优越性。例如，去年风雪和干旱成灾，个体牧民因抗灾能力薄弱，牲畜遭受了损失，而合作社却平均增殖了2％的牲畜。社员的现金和实物（肉、乳等）收入也在增加，1957年社员劳动日所得比1953年增加了十多倍。
    合作社在草原上建立了社址，有了学校、医疗站等组织，并且经营农业，种植饲料，为牧民定居逐步地创造了条件。合作社吸引着广大牧民，最近两年内，就有十万多牧民加入了合作社。根据蒙古发展合作社的远景规划，到1960年将有50％的牧民组织起来，今年，就要有四十二个合作社定居下来。
    农牧业社会主义重要部门的国营农牧场，已顺利地完成了计划。耕地面积五年来扩大了三倍多，占全国耕地面积的60％。谷物、马铃薯和蔬菜的收获量分别增加了两、三倍到十多倍。牲畜头数也显著增加。
    过去发展较慢的农业生产，在第二个五年计划期间有了较快的发展，全国耕地面积达到八万三千多公顷。谷物和饲料产量增加了。蒙古的科学工作者根据蒙古高寒的气候特点，正在进行改进农作物品种的试验研究工作。在蒙古草原上试种的梨树已经收获了第一批果实，在国营农牧场里我们还尝过草原上长出的西瓜。蒙古的处女地辽阔无垠，并散布着许多河流和湖泊，有着发展农业的远大前景，蒙古已经计划到1960年要把耕地面积扩大到二十几万公顷。
    蒙古民族工业比较年青，在苏联的帮助下才开始建立并有了发展，主要是畜产品加工工业。在第二个五年计划期间，蒙古进一步扩建了原有的许多工厂企业；在苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的帮助下，还新建了磁器、火柴、肥皂等工厂和那来河煤矿竖井。原来蒙苏合营的冶金和石油工业，已在1957年移交蒙古管理，并且超额完成了这一年的生产计划。
    第二个五年计划的工业总产值，在头四年就已经完成了。五年来，工业总产量增加了69％。主要工业如冶金、电力、煤、毡子和皮革的产量，都有不同程度的增加。工人阶级的队伍也逐步扩大了，在五年内增加了六千多名，全国工业部门的工人总数已达到两万多人。
    在平坦的草原上，首都乌兰巴托和各个省城以及重要工矿区都有公路连接。在交通运输方面的一件大事是，在苏联的帮助下修建了从乌兰巴托到扎门乌德长达七百多公里的“友谊铁路”，和原来通往苏联边境的一段连接起来，横贯蒙古南北，两端和中、苏两大邻邦连接起来了。1956年1月1日，蒙、中、苏三国铁路联运通车，进一步加强了三国人民的兄弟的友好往来，加强了蒙古的对外联系。
    蒙古在第二个五年计划内，已经使全部的学龄儿童入了学。革命胜利以前，蒙古只有一所容纳几十人的小学，现在，高等学校四所，专科学校十五所，有几千名学生，中、小学有四百三十多所，学生九万多名，超过了第二个五年计划规定的指标。
    蒙古的文艺工作者在具有民族特点和社会主义内容的文艺创作方面，五年内有很多收获。1957年内，作家们的作品有一千三百多篇，比五年计划初期增加了一倍多。蒙古作家协会要求作家进一步深入实际，联系群众，写出更好更多地反映劳动人民生活的作品。在蒙古的艺术舞台上，我们不仅看到过蒙古民族的歌舞和戏剧，而且还看到过许多外国名著，像莎士比亚的“奥赛罗”、捷克斯洛伐克名剧“仙笛”、中国歌剧“白毛女”，由于蒙古演员们成功的演出，得到观众的赞赏。
    五年内蒙古的医院、病床的增加数字，都超过了计划指标。蒙古在卫生保健方面采取的许多措施，使得人口的纯增率逐渐上升，目前已达到千分之十五点四。
    随着蒙古社会主义建设事业的发展，人民的物质和文化生活正在逐步提高。五年来，人民在银行的存款增加了二倍半。广大牧民的主要财富是牲畜，政府根据国家的发展，采取了适当减低牧业税、提高畜产品收购价格等措施，增加了牧民的收入。如1957年牧民的现款收入就比1956年增加了7.2％。工人工资在最近四年内增长了36％。
    五年来，蒙古的对外关系也有了显著的发展，先后同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫等国建立了正式外交关系。蒙古在这一期间曾派出十三个艺术团体到兄弟国家和法国访问演出，并且接待了外国几十个艺术团体以及各国文化科学界人士，促进了蒙古和各国的文化来往。蒙古的对外贸易关系现在已经扩大到全部社会主义国家，并且还和埃及、瑞士等国有了贸易来往。蒙古和各国人民间的友好关系有了进一步的发展。
