    Cotton is Everywhere, See If You Grab It
    People's lives are getting better and better, and everyone wants to wear more and better clothes. However, China's current cotton production cannot fully meet the people's demand for "sufficient clothing." How can this problem be solved? In the past few years, everyone has been focusing on cotton fields, trying to increase the yield per unit area and expand the cotton fields. However, it is difficult to rapidly increase the yield; expanding the cotton fields would squeeze out grain fields, affecting the issue of "sufficient food." We are working hard in this regard, but there are great limitations to this path. Recently, people have turned to another path—manufacturing chemical fibers. We are also working hard in this area, but the manufacturing process of chemical fibers is complex, requiring modern technology, large investments, and long construction periods. "Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." Now, the Zunyi Man-made Fiber Factory in Guizhou has found a new way to solve the cotton problem—extracting man-made fibers from wild plants and rice straw by hand. This method of using local materials, processing locally, and solving the people's clothing problem locally requires less money, yields quick results, has high output, and is feasible everywhere. Look, haven't they started production by borrowing a room and setting up a few simple tools? They use wild grass and bark as raw materials, aren't these raw materials inexhaustible? They use manual operation, the production method is simple, and the trial production cost is one-fifth lower than that of lint cotton, isn't it very convenient to promote?
    The manufacture of man-made cotton using the same method has also been successful in Sichuan and Shaanxi. These exciting news once again illustrate that the world of local industries is truly vast and boundless. The question is whether or not to try every possible means to study, to think, and to open up new paths.

    到处是棉花　看你抓不抓
    人民生活越过越美，大家都想穿得多些、好些，但是，我国目前棉花的产量还不能充分满足人民“丰衣”的要求。这个问题怎样解决呢？前几年，大家都在棉田上打主意，就是提高单位面积产量和扩大棉田，但是，产量难于飞快提高；棉田扩大，又会挤掉粮田，影响“足食”的问题。我们正在这方面努力，但是走这条路有很大的限制。近来，人们又转到了另一条道路——制造化学纤维，我们也正在这方面努力，但是，化学纤维的制造过程复杂，要采取现代技术，投资多，建厂时间长，“远水不能解近渴”。现在，贵州遵义人造棉厂找到了解决棉花问题的一条新途径——用手工从野生植物和稻草中提取人造纤维。这种就地取材、就地加工、就地解决人民穿衣问题的办法，花钱少，见效快，产量很高，到处可行。你看，他们不是借一间房子，置几件土工具，就动手生产了吗？他们用野草、树皮做原料，这种原料不是取之不尽、用之不竭的吗？他们用手工操作，生产方法简单，试制成本就比皮棉低五分之一，推广起来不是十分方便吗？
    在四川和陕西用同样方法制造人造棉也成功了。这些振奋人心的消息，再次说明了地方工业的天地真正是广阔无垠的。问题就在于是不是千方百计地去钻，去想，去开辟。
