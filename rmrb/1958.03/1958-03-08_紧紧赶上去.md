    Catch Up Closely

    The utilization coefficient of the Youth Solidarity Furnace in the Second Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company (An'gang) has increased from 8.66 at the end of January to 10.64, ranking first in the country and among the world's advanced ranks. This is very encouraging.
    The size of the open hearth utilization coefficient is one of the main indicators of the technological level of the steel industry. The rapid progress of the Youth Solidarity Furnace in An'gang in the shortest time reflects a great leap forward in their technical level. Originally, among the several steel plants in An'gang, the open hearth utilization coefficient of the Youth Friendship Furnace was the highest, not the Youth Solidarity Furnace. Because the soldiers of the Youth Solidarity Furnace brought into play a high degree of labor enthusiasm, a conscious labor attitude, and a humble and diligent spirit of enterprise, they not only caught up with the Youth Friendship Furnace in terms of open hearth utilization coefficient and smelting time, but also surpassed the indicators of the Youth Friendship Furnace. This fact shows that the most advanced technical indicators are not unattainable, and we will surely catch up as long as we learn humbly and diligently. This fact also shows that there is no end to the level of technology, and we can constantly create the highest records as long as we learn humbly and diligently.
    According to calculations, if all the open hearth furnaces in An'gang can reach the indicators of the Youth Solidarity Furnace, then An'gang can increase steel production by another 1.2 million tons on the basis of completing the production increase and conservation plan. This is equivalent to the output of a newly built medium-sized steel plant. If all the blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces in the country can reach this indicator, then China's steel output can be greatly increased. Here, a sharp question is raised to many units: How are some open hearth furnaces that are now behind prepared to catch up? How are the ironmaking blast furnaces prepared to catch up? How are the coking units prepared to catch up! How are the ore mining and transportation departments prepared to catch up? All these questions are not only the concern of the advanced production units at the forefront, but also the concern of the people of the whole country. We are willing to report their new creations and new records with the greatest enthusiasm.
    We hope that all open hearth and blast furnace fighters and related units will catch up closely.

    紧紧赶上去
    静宇
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂青年团结炉的利用系数由1月底的八点六六提高到十点六四，跃居全国第一位，列入了世界先进的行列。这是一件令人十分鼓舞的事情。
    平炉利用系数的大小是钢铁工业技术水平高低的主要标志之一，鞍钢青年团结炉在最短的时间能够有这样飞速的进步，反映了他们的技术水平有了很大的跃进。原来，在鞍钢几个炼钢厂当中，平炉利用系数最高的不是青年团结炉，而是青年友谊炉。由于青年团结炉的战士们发挥了高度的劳动热情、自觉的劳动态度和虚心苦学的进取精神，不仅在平炉利用系数、冶炼时间方面赶上了青年友谊炉，而且超过了青年友谊炉的指标。这个事实，说明最先进的技术指标不是高不可攀的，只要虚心苦学，就一定能赶上去。这个事实，还说明了技术水平是没有止境的，只要虚心苦学，就可以不断地创造最高纪录。
    据计算，如果鞍钢所有的平炉都能达到青年团结炉的指标，那末，鞍钢在完成增产节约计划的基础上还可以再增产一百二十万吨钢。相当于新建一个中型钢厂的产量。如果全国所有的高炉平炉都能达到这个指标，那末，我国钢铁产量就可大大增加。这里，就向很多单位提出了一个尖锐的问题：现在落在后面的一些平炉准备怎样赶上去？炼铁高炉准备怎样赶上去？炼焦的单位准备怎样赶上去！矿石开采和运输部门又准备怎样赶上去？所有这些问题，既是走在前面的先进生产单位所关心的，也是全国人民所关心的，我们愿以最大的热忱报道他们的新创造和新纪录。
    希望所有的平炉高炉的战士和有关单位，紧紧地赶上去。
