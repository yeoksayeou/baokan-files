Mothers, march on!
In the past, nothing could be seen. Terror, a dark night, shrouded the world... Who is that? Groaning under the lash, suffering endless torment. Chains bound their hands and feet. Their eyes look so sad. Who is it? Treated as toys, wearing shackles around their necks, chased and sold everywhere! Locked in dark rooms, losing freedom like livestock. Unable to see the bright world outside the window, rosy faces turn pale. Who is it, held in the arms of the brutal, and deprived of the right to live freely. Those poor people eagerly hope to reach out their hands to beg for clothes and food. A brilliant sun appeared from the sky, illuminating the earth and revealing everything. All kinds of insects, bats, fearing this light, began to flee, collapse, and scatter in all directions... Dear mothers! Wipe away your tears! The light you have long awaited has arrived. Raise your heads! Free, happy days have arrived. In the lush garden, your withered and beautiful flower branches that could not see water have now begun to sprout and grow! The spring water filled with garbage has been dredged. Those springs, with silver water, flow non-stop with lively sounds... You, breathing freely. Drink! This is the sweet spring of new life that will heal your wounded wings... The dark days of spreading poison have passed. The brutal era of bullies has passed, it is over... The reactionaries, imperialism, the flames of double oppression, have been extinguished and turned to ashes... The savior, with a bright face, opens his broad, warm embrace, like a kind mother calling us... A broad road of wisdom and civilization, free labor, and a happy life has been opened up before us. Spread your wings and prepare to fly, strive and be encouraged in labor; she will sing, she will play the song of happiness... Who is it? Sincere, kind, caring for us, illuminating the road, opening up a broad life, an boundless sea. Who is it? Pioneered civilization and led us onto a new path? Mothers, you must recognize that it is the great people's leader, the wise Mao Zedong! Enthusiastic mentor, benevolent, kind father... Our children and grandchildren will grow up happily in his garden. Let them not know pain and tears... Women of all nationalities! Let us join hands and build our great motherland together. Boost our energy, strive for the upstream, and throw ourselves into the fiery struggle to make our motherland happier and more prosperous day by day. Eradicate the bad habits left over from the old society, and temper our will into steel. Mothers, march on! Our road is bright, and our cause is just. A happy future, with open arms, awaits us...

    母亲们，前进啊！
    包尔汉过去，什么都看不见。恐怖，黑暗的夜，笼罩着世界……那是谁？呻吟在皮鞭下，遭受着无尽的蹂躏。铁链捆绑着她们的手脚。眼睛显得那么悲伤。是谁哟？被当做玩具，脖子带着枷锁，到处被追赶，被出卖！被关在暗室里，像牲畜似的失去自由。看不见窗外的光明世界，红润的面庞变得苍白。是谁，被搂在残暴者怀里，又剥夺去自由生活的权利。那些贫困者殷切地盼望着伸出双手祈求穿的和吃的。从天空出现了一个灿烂的太阳，照明了大地，显示了一切。各种虫豸，蝙蝠，畏惧这光芒，开始向各方迅速逃窜、垮台、分散……亲爱的母亲们！拭干眼泪！长年期待的光明已经来临。抬起你的头来吧！自由的、快乐的日子已经来临。茂盛的花园中，你那见不到水的枯萎了的美丽的花枝现在已开始发芽、滋长！被垃圾填塞的泉水已经疏通。那些泉眼，银色的水用活泼的声音一刻不停地潺潺流着……你，自由地呼吸着。喝吧！这是新生机的甘泉会治愈你受伤的翅膀……撒播着毒素的黑暗日子，已经过去了。恶霸们的残暴时代已经过去了，结束了……反动派，帝国主义，双层压迫的火焰，已经熄灭了，成了灰烬……救星，用灿烂的面孔，张开他宽广的温暖的怀抱，像慈祥的母亲招唤着我们……在我们面前已经开辟了，智慧与文明，自由劳动，幸福生活的康庄大道。展开了翅膀准备飞翔，在劳动中奋发鼓舞；她要歌唱她要演奏幸福的歌……是谁？对我们真诚、慈善、爱护照明了道路开辟了广阔的生活，无垠的大海。是谁？开拓了文明使我们踏上新的道路？母亲们，你们要认清那就是伟大的人民领袖英明的毛泽东！热心的导师仁慈的，亲切的父亲……我们的儿孙在他的花园里将愉快的生长。让他们不懂得痛苦和眼泪……各民族的妇女们！我们要共同携起手来，建设我们伟大的祖国。鼓起干劲，力争上游，投入火热的斗争让我们的祖国一天天，幸福繁荣。铲除旧社会留下的恶习，把我们的意志锻炼成钢。母亲们，前进吧！我们的道路是光明的，我们的事业是正义的。幸福的未来，张开怀抱等待着我们……
