Vertical Kiln Cement Plant

The Ministry of Construction Engineering has recently formulated a plan for central, provincial, special district, county, township, and agricultural cooperative levels to produce cement, based on the need for cement in production and construction across various regions. To help special districts quickly establish small cement plants, the ministry has expedited the creation of a standard design for a small, ordinary vertical kiln cement plant.

This type of vertical kiln cement plant has many advantages: low investment, short construction time, small footprint, simple equipment, easy operation, raw materials can be obtained locally, and it uses less steel and wood. Generally, special districts, and even counties, have the conditions to build them independently. According to the standard design, the annual output of this small cement plant is 32,000 tons, with most of the quality being 300 grade (compressive strength of 300 kilograms per square centimeter), and a small portion reaching 400 grade, equivalent in quality to the same grade of cement produced by large cement plants. The total investment, including 615 kW of power supply equipment, is only 1.19 million yuan. If calculated based on a population of 1.2 million people per special district, each person only needs to contribute one yuan to build the plant. The selling price of cement produced by this type of plant is very low. Because of local supply, long-distance transportation is avoided; only a small amount of freight needs to be added to the cost of 25.33 yuan per ton. According to the general situation in the inland areas, using this cement is more than two-thirds cheaper than using cement from large cement plants far away. The construction time for this type of plant is only six to eight months. It occupies just over six mu and one fen of land. The raw materials required for this small cement plant, such as limestone and clay, are inexhaustible. Where there are small iron and steel plants, blast furnace slag—a waste product of iron smelting—can also be used to replace clay, which can improve quality and increase output by about 51%. The operation of this cement plant is relatively simple, and workers who have undergone about three months of training can master the operating techniques.

The equipment required for this small cement plant is relatively simple. The raw material mill, cement mill, and electrical equipment all use standard products from the First Ministry of Machine Building. In addition to the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building, machine factories and iron factories in various provinces and cities can also manufacture these equipments themselves.

    立窑水泥厂
    建筑工程部最近根据各地生产建设中对水泥的需要，制定了中央、省、专区、县、乡、农业社六级生产水泥的计划。为了帮助各专区迅速建立小型水泥厂，这个部已经赶制了一个小型普通立窑水泥厂的标准设计。
    这种立窑水泥厂有许多优点：投资少，建厂时间短，占地面积少，设备简单，操作方便，原料可以就地取材，使用钢材木材少。一般专区，甚至县都有条件自行筹建。按照标准设计，这种小型水泥厂的年产量为三万二千吨，质量大部分是三百号（每一平方公分耐压强度为三百公斤），少数可以达到四百号，同大型水泥厂生产的同标号水泥质量相等。全部投资，包括六百一十五瓩的供电设备在内，只要一百一十九万元。如以每个专区一百二十万人口计算，每人只要出一元钱就可以把厂子建起来。这种厂子生产的水泥销售价格很低。由于就地供应，避免了长途运输，在每吨成本费二十五元三角三的基础上，只需要加少量运费。按照内地一般情况，使用这种水泥比远距离用大型水泥厂的水泥便宜三分之二以上。这种厂的建厂时间只要六到八个月。占地六亩一分多。这种小型水泥厂所需要的原料是取之不尽的石灰石、粘土等。有小型炼铁厂的地方，还可以用炼铁的废渣——高炉矿渣来代替粘土，这样既可提高质量，产量也可以提高51％左右。这种水泥厂操作比较简单，经过三个月左右训练的工人就可以掌握操作技术。
    这种小型水泥厂需要的设备比较简单，原料磨、水泥磨以及电气设备都选用了第一机械工业部的标准产品。这些设备，除一机部所属工厂可以制造外，各省、市的机器工厂、铁工厂也可以自己制造。（附图片）
