Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu - Spring is the breeding season for sparrows. Sichuan province is launching a massive sudden attack to wipe out sparrows. The method adopted in this battle was recently summarized from the masses, that is, using the weakness of sparrows that they cannot fly long distances and persistently, everyone acts, takes charge of their own area, chases fiercely and relentlessly, not allowing sparrows to stop or perch anywhere, not allowing sparrows to get a grain of food or a drop of water, so that sparrows are hungry and tired, unable to fly; at the same time, coordinating with capture, beatings, and poisoning to achieve the purpose of eliminating sparrows.

On March 17, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference with fourteen special districts and two cities in the province. Yan Xiufeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a battle arrangement at the meeting to comprehensively eliminate sparrows starting from the 20th. Some special districts and counties that started the sparrow elimination battle earlier already started the sparrow elimination battle on the 14th and achieved results. The Wenjiang Special District composed a sparrow extermination army of 2.58 million people in seventeen counties, launching a comprehensive encirclement and suppression of sparrows on the more than 10,000 square kilometers of the Western Sichuan Plain. From the 14th to the 16th, more than 1 million sparrows were killed, starved, exhausted, and captured alive, and more than 56,000 sparrow eggs were obtained. Chengdu City has had more than 400,000 people participate in this battle since the 14th. In various streets, courtyards, roofs, walls, and suburban forests, bamboo clumps, fields, and tomb dams, people are on guard and watching the movements of sparrows. Scarecrows and various noise-making devices are installed everywhere in higher places. From morning to night, noises and shouts rise and fall one after another. By the 17th, according to incomplete statistics, more than 70,000 sparrows have been eliminated.

According to the Anhui Daily, Suji District in Fuyang County used new tactics in the battle to eliminate the four pests, setting up inescapable nets everywhere to launch a general attack on the remaining sparrows, creating a miracle of annihilating the sparrows in one fell swoop.

With the in-depth development of the movement to eliminate the four pests, sparrows are becoming more and more cunning. They fly away when they see people during the day and dare not return to their nests at night. After studying the enemy's situation, the Suji District Headquarters for Eliminating the Four Pests decided to adopt new tactics to deal with the enemy. They divided the more than 60,000 combatants in the district into chase teams, reconnaissance teams, and guard teams, organized by village, and launched five large-scale encirclements and one general attack on the sparrows. Scarecrows were tied to trees everywhere in the district, scaring the sparrows from climbing the trees. On the ground, an average of one person was monitoring and chasing the sparrows every three mu of land. The assault teams were divided into sections and segments, armed with local guns, slingshots, bamboo poles and other weapons, and put into battle. At eight o'clock on the morning of February 15, at the sound of an order, gongs and drums rang loudly, guns fired in all directions, and shouts shook the sky, scaring the sparrows into confusion. They dared not land on the trees, and dared not stop in the villages. In addition, they could not fly far, so they had to fall from the sky and surrender. In this way, after three days and three nights of general attack, more than 14,000 sparrows were captured in the district, and all the remaining sparrows were wiped out.

Now, many places in Fuyang and Bengbu special districts have promoted this experience. On March 15, Bengbu City dispatched an army of 150,000 people. On the roofs of all buildings in the city, in the streets and alleys, in family courtyards, and on the Huai River boats, there were combatants armed with weapons, launching an annihilation battle against the sparrows. After the battle began, the sparrows were forced to fly around, with no food to eat, no water to drink, exhausted, and had nowhere to escape. In the end, they had to fall to the ground one after another, some falling into the river and drowning. That day, the masses picked up a lot of sparrows on the ground. These sparrows were all panting with their mouths open and spitting blood from exhaustion. In a day and a half, the city captured more than 1,900 sparrows, 376 of which fell due to exhaustion. The city's Headquarters for Eliminating the Four Pests summed up the experience of this battle and unanimously affirmed that the all-out general suppression is a good tactic for eliminating sparrows.

    四川人民突击围剿麻雀
    阜阳蚌埠展开全线总攻
    据新华社成都电　春天正是麻雀产卵繁殖的季节。四川全省正在展开一场声势浩大的突击围剿麻雀的战斗。这次战斗所采取的方法是最近从群众中总结出来的，就是利用麻雀不能作远距离和持久飞行的弱点，人人动手，分片负责，穷追猛打，不让麻雀在任何地方停歇、栖息、不让麻雀得到一粒粮食、一滴饮水，使麻雀饥饿疲乏，不能飞翔；同时配合捕打、毒杀，达到歼灭麻雀的目的。
    3月17日，中共四川省委召开了全省十四个专区和两个市的电话会议。中共四川省委书记处书记阎秀峰在会上作了从20日开始全面灭雀的战斗布置。开展得较早的一些专区和市县从14日就已经开始了灭雀战斗，并获得成绩。温江专区十七个县组成了二百五十八万人的灭雀大军，在一万多平方公里的川西平原上，向麻雀展开全面围剿，14日到16日三天中，共打死、饿死、累死和活捉麻雀一百多万只，并获雀蛋五万六千多个。成都市从14日起，有四十多万人参加这一战斗。城内各个街道、院落、屋顶、墙头和郊区的树林、竹丛、田野、坟坝等处，整天都有人站岗放哨，严密监视麻雀的行迹。较高的地方到处装置了稻草人和各种响器，从早到晚，响声、?喝声此起彼落。到17日，据不完全统计，已歼灭了麻雀七万多只。
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：阜阳县苏集区在除四害战斗中运用新的战术，四处布下天罗地网，向残余麻雀展开总攻击，创造了一举将麻雀歼灭殆尽的奇迹。
    随着除四害运动深入展开，麻雀越来越狡猾，白天见人就远走高飞，夜间不敢归窝，苏集区除四害指挥所研究了敌情以后，决定采用新的战术来对付敌人。他们把全区六万多战斗员，以庄为单位，分别组成追击队、侦察队、守营队等组织，向麻雀展开了声势浩大的五次大围剿，一次总攻击。全区处处树上都绑有草人，吓的麻雀不敢上树，地上平均每三亩地便有一人在监视和追击麻雀，各突击队分片分段手持土枪、弹弓，竹竿等武器投入战斗。2月15日上午八时，一声号令下，霎时锣鼓喧天，枪鸣四野，喊声震耳，吓得麻雀晕头转向，树上不敢落，村庄不敢停，加上它不能远飞，只好从天上掉下来，俯首就擒。这样，经过三天三夜总攻击，全区捕捉麻雀一万四千多只，所有残余麻雀一扫而光。
    现在，阜阳、蚌埠两专区很多地方已推广了这一经验。蚌埠市3月15日出动十五万大军，全市所有的楼房顶上，大街小巷，家庭院落，淮河船只上，到处都有手持武器的战斗员，向麻雀展开了歼灭战。战斗开始后，逼得麻雀飞来飞去，无食吃，无水喝，疲于奔命，无处可逃，最后只好纷纷自动栽落地下，有的堕入河里淹死。这天群众在地上拣到了很多麻雀，这些麻雀个个累得张嘴喘气，口吐鲜血。在一天半中间，全市捕雀一千九百多只，其中有三百七十六只是由于疲劳过度而栽下来的。市除四害指挥部总结了这次战斗经验，一致肯定全线齐剿是消灭麻雀的好战术。（严威、邵德振、汪鼎）
