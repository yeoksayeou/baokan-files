Breaking Down Township and Commune Boundaries: Comprehensive Planning for a Water Conservancy Network
Fushun: Every Mu of Land Has Water for Irrigation

(Our Report) Fushun County, Sichuan Province, has over 300,000 farmers currently building a water conservancy network. By the end of March, a network of ponds, weirs, reservoirs, and irrigation pools, dotted everywhere and interconnected by irrigation canals, will be formed.

Fushun County is located in the hilly area of southern Sichuan. Through the mass movement of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, the irrigated area of water conservancy projects in the county has reached more than 1,050,000 mu, with a drought resistance capacity of over 50 days, exceeding 11.6% of the county's total field area. However, due to a lack of careful planning, a small number of fields on the mountain slopes still lack water for irrigation, and the vast majority of over 500,000 mu of dry land have no water for irrigation. On the other hand, there is also the phenomenon of water waste. Based on this situation, in late February, under the leadership of the Fushun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the planning and construction of a water conservancy irrigation network began.

The method of building the water conservancy network is to take water conservancy projects such as ponds, weirs, and reservoirs as the center, and according to irrigation needs, build a number of small reservoirs and irrigation pools around them, scattered like stars, and then connect them from the mountains to the foot of the mountains with irrigation canals to form an irrigation system so that every mountain top, every field, and every plot of land can be irrigated. In the planning, all regions broke down the boundaries of townships, villages, and communes, and according to the principle of increasing gravity irrigation and rational water use, diverted the excess water stored in each pond and weir to the "dead corner" fields and dry land that originally had no water conservancy guarantee. The people leading the planning are all district, township, and commune cadres. Through typical demonstrations and visits for study, they quickly became experts in planning the water conservancy network.

At present, the county has built more than 70,000 reservoirs and many canals, diverting surplus water from ponds and weirs and natural storage, which can already meet the irrigation needs of 80% of the county's dry land.

    打破乡社界限　全面规划水利网
    富顺每亩地都有水浇
    本报讯　四川省富顺县有三十多万农民正在建设水利网。3月底，一个塘、堰、蓄水池、浇灌池星罗棋布，灌溉沟渠四通八达的水利网就可形成。
    富顺县在川南丘陵地区。经过去冬今春兴修水利的群众性运动，全县水利工程的灌溉面积已达一百零五万多亩，抗旱能力在五十天以上，超过该县总田面积11.6％。但由于缺乏周密规划，少数山坡上的田仍然缺水灌溉，五十多万亩旱地绝大部分无水浇灌；另一方面，浪费用水的现象却又存在。根据这一情况，2月下旬，在中共富顺县委领导下开始了水利灌溉网的规划和建设。
    建设水利网的办法，是以塘、堰、水库等水利工程为中心，根据灌溉需要，在四周星罗棋布地修建若干个小蓄水池和浇灌池，然后从山上到山下，用灌溉沟渠把它们联结成一个灌溉系统，使每个山头、每块田、地都能引水灌溉。在规划中，各地打破了乡、村、社的界限，按增加自流灌溉、合理用水的原则，将每个塘堰的多余蓄水引到原无水利保证的“死角”田和旱地里去。领导规划的人，都是区、乡、社干部。他们通过典型示范和参观学习，很快成为规划水利网的内行。
    目前，这个县已修好七万多个蓄水池和许多水渠，引来塘堰余水和自然蓄水，已可满足全县80％的旱地的浇灌需要。
