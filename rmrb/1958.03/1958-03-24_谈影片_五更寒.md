On the Film "Before Dawn"
Ning Gan

The many characters in the film "Before Dawn" leave a vivid and profound impression on people. Some of them you admire and take as examples, while others you hate and take as a warning. When these characters and their different life experiences intertwine in your mind, the arduous and complex struggle after 1946, when the New Fourth Army withdrew from the Dabie Mountains base area, appears before your eyes; when you revisit those scenes, you feel even more how precious today is, and you will be better able to encourage and spur yourself on.

At the very beginning of the story, the protagonist, Lao Liu, is in a very acute situation: the Kuomintang army launched the prelude to the civil war in the Central Plains, and hundreds of thousands of troops surrounded our Dabie Mountains base area. The Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army broke through the encirclement and withdrew to the north of the Yellow River. County Party Secretary Lao Liu, County Party Organization Minister Mo Wenjie, and Commander Shi Pinchun were ordered to stay behind to lead a small guerrilla force and fight the enemy. At this difficult time, Mo Wenjie betrayed and defected to the enemy. Moreover, due to the enemy's bloody massacre, activists and the masses dared not approach us. The world had changed, and people had changed. Without the support of the masses, we couldn't even get food, so how could we persist in the struggle? When the film shows this point, the focus of the conflict is on Lao Liu, and the audience anxiously waits to see what Lao Liu will do.

As the story develops, it is still a series of thrilling struggles, but hope also emerges. Finally, after Lao Liu entered the village for the second time, he was warmly received and supported by the activist Wang Tai. Later, Lao Liu used a ruse to force the enemy regimental commander Huang Pangzi to release some of the arrested party members and revolutionary masses, causing the flames of struggle to reignite. Although these plots take up little space, they fully demonstrate Lao Liu's resourcefulness and bravery, as well as the masses' love for him.

The handling of another traitor, Mo Daxin, once again demonstrates Lao Liu's shrewdness and competence. When Lao Liu obtained conclusive evidence that Mo Daxin had become an enemy informant, he went to Mo Daxin's home, where Mo Daxin was guarding his wife and children, eating chicken and drinking wine. Seeing Lao Liu push the door open with a murderous look on his face, he knew he had been exposed. He begged Lao Liu to forgive him for the sake of his wife and children. This was indeed a difficult scene to handle. Who doesn't hate traitors! How should he be dealt with? Secretary Liu sternly rebuked Mo Daxin, and then proposed that he perform meritorious service to redeem himself. This is a dramatic and sudden change, but it is also a reasonable one. Here, it seems as if Secretary Liu forgave him because of Mo Daxin's wife and children. But that's not the case. The reason for forgiveness is firstly that Mo Daxin immediately confessed his guilt, and more importantly, that he was honest and loyal when he was a squad leader in our army in the past, and now he was forced by the traitor Mo Wenjie to betray the Party and serve the enemy, and had not yet committed any bloody crimes. At that time, in the arduous and complex situation in the Dabie Mountains, would it be more effective to kill such a person, or to use him to fight against the enemy? This not only shows Secretary Liu's maturity and stability, but also shows the complexity of the struggle. Without familiarity with the struggle at that time, without considerable policy cultivation, and relying solely on artistic skills, one could not write such a moving dramatic scene.

This kind of moving dramatic scene not only appears in Lao Liu, but also in Mu Ying, Lao Liangcai, Qiao Feng, and others. Take the scene where the female Communist Party member Mu Ying's husband deserted and returned, which is very well written. Mu Ying was so stubborn that she never lowered her head despite suffering all kinds of torture in prison. When her husband said that after she came out of the enemy prison, the guerrillas did not trust her, she was extremely heartbroken, and the cup in her hand fell to the ground... But later she persuaded her husband: "...You should still go back. If they don't trust me, they don't trust me. I do things according to my conscience. We must be upright people when we are alive." This scene is well-layered and full of human touch. Mu Ying's gentle and kind character and her selfless and selfless qualities are fully demonstrated.

The film has many advantages, but in the composition and development of certain conflicts, and in the handling of certain characters' personalities, there is still a lack of strict logic. For example, the scene where Secretary Liu decides to eliminate the enemy's eyes and ears in each village simplifies the mental outlook of this experienced leader. Judging from the situation shown in the film, the strength of the guerrillas at that time was very weak. Whether the enemy's eyes and ears in each village could be eliminated overnight is a problem. Although Lao Liu said that he would gather people to do it together, how many people could be gathered when the masses were avoiding us? Therefore, when Huang Pangzi scolded Lao Liu the next day for killing his village informants overnight, the audience felt that it was not real. Another example is the character Qiao Feng. When she obtained the intelligence that the traitor Mo Daxin sent to the enemy, she should have handed it over to Secretary Liu and the others without delay, but she did not do so because her sweetheart, the guerrilla Luo Wenchuan, had not reconciled with her. This plot shows that Qiao Feng has no political consciousness. The reason she sympathizes with and supports the revolution is for her love with Luo Wenchuan. However, when she saw Secretary Liu say to the local bully Mo Baochang: "I want to see Commander Huang," she thought that Lao Liu and the others had also wavered, and sneered: "Oh, Secretary Liu, I thought you were a tough guy, who knew you would soften after being slapped once." This shows that she is a person with high political awareness. This is obviously inconsistent with her character, forming a contradiction.

Despite these shortcomings in "Before Dawn," from the perspective of its ideological content and artistic form, it is undoubtedly a good film.

    谈影片“五更寒”
    宁干
    影片“五更寒”的许多人物都给人留下了鲜明而深刻的印象。他们，有的使你敬慕而引为榜样，有的使你痛恨而引为鉴戒。当这些人物和他们不同的生活经历在你脑子中交织起来时，当时——1946年，新四军撤出大别山根据地之后的艰苦复杂的斗争情景，便出现在你的眼前；当你重温那些情景时，你就愈加感到今天的可爱，你就会更好地勉励和鞭策自己。
    故事一开头，主人公老刘就处在矛盾相当尖锐的境地：蒋军在中原发起内战序幕，数十万大军包围了我大别山根据地。新四军五师突破包围撤到黄河以北去了。县委书记老刘和县委组织部长莫文阶、指挥长施品春三个人奉命留下来领导一支小小的游击队和敌人斗争。就在这艰难的时候，莫文阶又叛变投敌了。而且由于敌人血腥的屠杀，积极分子和群众也都不敢接近我们。天变了，人也变了，没有群众的支持，连饭都吃不上，怎么坚持斗争呢？影片映到这里，矛盾的焦点集中在老刘身上，观众都焦灼地期待着看老刘怎么办。
    故事发展下去，仍是一连串的惊心动魄的斗争，但是希望也随着展现出来。终于老刘第二次进村后，受到积极分子王太热情的接待和支持，后来老刘又用计逼使敌团长黄胖子放出了一部分被捕的党员和革命群众，使斗争的烈火重新燃烧了起来。这些情节虽然所占篇幅不多，但是却充分表明了老刘的机智英勇，以及群众对他的爱戴。
    对于另一叛徒莫大新的处理，再次表现出老刘的精明干练。当老刘得到莫大新当了敌人情报员的确凿证据后，去到莫大新家中，莫大新正守着老婆孩子吃鸡喝酒。看到老刘满脸杀气地推门而入，知道自己的事发了。他哀求老刘看在老婆孩子分上宽恕了他。这真是个难以处理的场面，谁不痛恨叛徒呢！该怎么对付呢？刘书记严厉地斥责了莫大新，随后又提出要他立功赎罪。这是一个富有戏剧性的突然变化，也是一个合情合理的变化。这里，看来好像是刘书记因为莫大新的老婆孩子而宽恕了他。其实不然，所以宽恕，一来是莫大新一开始就低头认罪，而更主要的是他过去在我军当班长时，老诚忠实，现在又是在叛徒莫文阶威逼之下叛党事敌，还没有造成什么血债。当时，在大别山那种艰苦复杂的情况下，对这样的人，是杀了作用大，还是利用他对敌进行斗争作用大呢？这里不仅写出了刘书记的成熟稳重，也写出了斗争的复杂性。不熟悉当时斗争生活，没有相当的政策修养，单凭艺术技巧，是写不出这样动人的戏剧场面来的。
    这种动人的戏剧场面，不仅出现在老刘身上，还出现在穆英、劳良才、巧凤等人身上。就说女共产党员穆英的丈夫开小差回来那场戏吧，写的就非常好。穆英是那样倔强，在监狱内受尽各种酷刑，未曾低过头。当丈夫说出她从敌人监狱中出来之后，游击队对她不信任了时，她痛心极了，手中的杯子落在地上。……可是后来她又劝起丈夫来：“……你还是回去吧，他们不信任我就不信任吧，我凭我的良心办事，我们活着就得当个正派人。”这一场戏层次分明，而且富有人情味，穆英那种温柔善良的性格、正直忘我的品质完全表现出来了。
    影片的优点是不少的，但是在某些矛盾的构成和发展上，在某些人物性格的处理上，还缺乏严密逻辑。例如：刘书记决定把各村的敌人耳目拔掉这一场戏，就未免把这位富有斗争经验的领导者的精神面貌简单化了。从影片中表现的情况看来，当时游击队的力量很单薄，一夜之间能不能拔掉各村的耳目是个问题；尽管老刘说要召集人一起来干，可是群众都在躲避我们的时候，又能召集起多少人来？因之，第二天黄胖子叫骂老刘一夜杀了他各村耳目时，观众就感到不真实了。再例如巧凤这个人物，她拿到了叛徒莫大新送给敌人的情报时，本来应毫不迟延的交给刘书记他们，可是她没有这样作，因为他的心上人、游击队员罗文川还未同她和好。这个情节，说明了巧凤是没有政治觉悟的。她所以同情并支持革命，是为了和罗文川的爱情。可是当她看见刘书记向地头蛇莫保长说：“我想见见黄团长”时，以为老刘他们也动摇了，竟冷笑的说：“哟，刘书记，我以为你是个硬汉子，谁知道才挨了个嘴巴就软了。”这又表明她是个政治觉悟很高的人。这显然与她的性格不符，形成前后矛盾。
    尽管“五更寒”存在着这些缺点，但从它所表现的思想内容和艺术形式来看，无疑地是一部好影片。
