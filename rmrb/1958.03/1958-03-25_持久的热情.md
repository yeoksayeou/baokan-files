    Lasting Enthusiasm
    Chen Xiaoyu
    People's Daily reported on March 14th: Comrade Katsalin, head coach of the Soviet national football team, pointed out fairly: "Chinese athletes are not slow in speed and are relatively flexible, and their jumping ability is also good, but their endurance is poor. Taking the Beijing team as an example, their technique is good, but due to insufficient endurance, they cannot persevere in the second half, and their speed is therefore reduced. Other teams have similar situations."
    The "endurance" in football field, its "lasting" quality and "tenacity", are quite thought-provoking.
    The “endurance”, persistence and resilience on the football field largely depend on the strength of the physical strength. Of course, even physical strength can be obtained through persistent training.
    In many other aspects, especially in marching towards culture and science, this "endurance", resilience, and persistence are determined by a person's determination and perseverance. With this determination and perseverance, the bastions of culture and science can be conquered.
    Everyone has a common understanding: Is it difficult to learn a foreign language? It's both difficult and not difficult. It is said to be difficult, learning a foreign language is like a long-distance race. Often many people do not finish the race and stop halfway, thus rendering the section of the road they have run invalid. It is said to be not difficult because if you are determined to run to the end, although some people may run fast and some people may run slowly, sooner or later you can achieve results.
    The brilliant achievements of the world's great scientists, great theorists, and great writers are often inseparable from their tenacity, endurance, and perseverance. Marx's "Das Kapital" is a world-shaking classic, and it is built on the foundation of persistent and unremitting exploration, research, and pursuit of truth. "For example, in order to write the twenty-odd pages on British labor law in 'Das Kapital', he studied the entire library of blue books containing reports from the British and Scottish Inquiry Committees and Factory Inspectors. The pencil marks indicate that he had read these books from beginning to end." "He was never satisfied with indirectly obtained materials and always sought original works to get to the bottom of things, no matter how troublesome it was. Even to verify an unimportant fact, he would make a special trip to the British Museum." (See pages 77 and 78 of the book "Reminiscences of Marx and Engels").
    Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a monumental masterpiece in classical literature, and it was written after the author "read it in the Mourning Red Studio for ten years, adding and deleting it five times". It can be said that he exhausted his efforts.
    During the period of the democratic revolution, Chairman Mao taught us to overthrow the two great mountains of imperialism and feudalism with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. What is the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains? It is revolutionary resilience, revolutionary persistence, and the drive to never give up until the goal is achieved.
    Now is the period of socialist revolution. We must catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little more; we must complete and over fulfill the forty articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development (Draft) within ten years. Culture and science are very important for the smooth completion of the above two major tasks. However, since we can use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to overthrow the two great mountains of imperialism and feudalism, we can also use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to conquer the cultural bastions and scientific bastions!
    We need a Great Leap Forward, we need the burning enthusiasm to push our work forward greatly. I would like to add a sentence: Lasting enthusiasm; continuous leaps forward!

    持久的热情
    陈笑雨
    3月14日人民日报消息：苏联国家足球队总教练卡察林同志公正地指出：“中国运动员速度不慢、且较灵活，弹跳也好，但耐力差。以北京队为例，他们技术不错，但由于耐力不够，下半场就无法坚持，速度因此减低。其他球队也有类似情况。”
    这个耐力不够的“耐”字，真是耐人寻味。
    足球场上的“耐”、持久、韧性如何，多半决定于体力的强弱。当然，就是体力，也是可以在持久的训练中获得的。
    在其他许多方面，特别是在向文化进军、向科学进军方面，这个“耐”、韧性、持久，则决定于一个人决心和毅力。有了这个决心和毅力，文化的堡垒、科学的堡垒是可以攻得破的。
    大家有一个共同的认识：学会一种外国文难不难呢？又难又不难。说难，学外国文像长途赛跑那样，往往不少人，没有跑完，中途停下来了，于是连他所跑过的一段路程，一并作废。说不难，决心跑到底，虽然也可以有人跑快，有人跑慢，但是，迟早是可以跑出结果来的。
    世界上的大科学家、大理论家、大文学家，他们的辉煌的成就，往往是和他们韧性、耐、毅力分不开的。马克思的“资本论”，是一部盖世的经典之作，它正是建筑在持久不懈的探索、研究、追求真理的基础之上的。“举个例来说，为了写‘资本论’中关于英国劳工法的二十多页文章，他曾把整个图书馆里载有英国与苏格兰调查委员会和工厂视察员报告的蓝皮书都研究过。那些铅笔记号表示他曾从头至尾地通读了这些书”。“他从不满足于间接得来的材料，总要找原著寻根究底，不管这样做有多麻烦。即令是为了证实一个不重要的事实，他也要特意到大英博物馆去一趟。”（见“回忆马克思、恩格斯”一书77页78页）
    曹雪芹的红楼梦，乃古典文学作品中的登峰之巨著，那是经过作者“于悼红轩中披阅十载、增删五次”写出来的。可说是用尽心血。
    在民主主义革命期间，毛主席教导我们要以愚公移山的精神，推翻帝国主义、封建主义这两座大山。愚公移山的精神是什么精神？是革命的韧性，革命的持久力，不达目的誓不休的干劲。
    现在是社会主义革命时期了。要在十五年或更多一点时间内在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国；要在十年之内完成和超额完成农业生产发展纲要（草案）四十条。要顺利完成上述两大任务，文化、科学十分重要。但是，既然我们能够用愚公移山的精神，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义两座大山；我们同样可以用愚公移山的精神，去攻破文化堡垒和科学堡垒！
    我们需要大跃进，需要大大把工作推进一步的如火的热情。我想加一句：持久的热情；连续的跃进！
