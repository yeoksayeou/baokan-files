    The Reputation Precedes

    Lin Jichun

    One day around lunchtime, near the end of the workday, an old man in his fifties entered the business hall of the Wucheng Street branch of the Zhangjiakou post office, wanting to send a remittance. The old man couldn't fill out the remittance form, nor was he familiar with the remittance process. In the past, he always asked others to fill it out for him. This time, he didn't have time to ask for help, so he only brought a letter with the address written on the envelope. The clerk, Bu Zhongyu, proactively helped the old man fill out the remittance form. When asked at which post office the old man wanted to withdraw the money, the old man said "Dingxian." But upon looking at the envelope, it was addressed to a rural area. So Bu Zhongyu became suspicious: if he lived in the countryside, why would he go to Dingxian city to withdraw the money?

    "How far is your home from the county seat?"

    "More than eighty li!"

    "Then is it convenient to withdraw the money?"

    "If it's not convenient, what can I do? It's been sent this way for years!"

    Bu Zhongyu picked up the "Post Office Name List" and said, "Let's choose a withdrawal post office closer to your home this time! I'll read them to you, and when you hear a place closer to your home, just say so." So she read: Qingfengdian, Liqingu, Railway Station... "Okay! Right here! It's less than two li from my home," the old man happily said. "Listen a little further, is there anything even closer?" Bu Zhongyu continued to read: Zhaixidian, Zhuanlu...

    "That's enough! That's enough! It's at my doorstep! It's less than one li," the old man happily interrupted. At this moment, Bu Zhongyu picked up her pen and quickly filled out the postal money order for the old man, affixed the postage stamps, completed the registration procedures, and handed the receipt and acknowledgement slip to the old man. Then, the old man smiled at Bu Zhongyu and asked, "Comrade! What is your name?" "My surname is Bu, Bu Zhongyu." The old man looked at Bu Zhongyu's round face and praised, "Your reputation truly precedes you."

    It turned out that this old man lived on Changshou Street in Qiaodong District. In the past, he would send letters and remittances at the nearby Qiaodong Post Office. This time, the old man saw an article in the newspaper praising Bu Zhongyu's good service, so he specifically took a bus to come here to send his remittance.

    名不虚传
    林继春
    一天中午快下班的时候，张家口武城街支局营业室，进来一位五十多岁的老大爷要汇款。老大爷不会填汇款单，也不熟习汇款的方法，过去寄钱都是求别人给填写的。这次因来不及求人，只带着一封别人给写好的信皮。营业员卜仲于就主动地给老大爷填汇款单。问到老大爷在那个局取款时，老大爷说是“定县”。可是一看信皮上写的是寄给乡村的。于是卜仲于发生了怀疑：家在乡村，为什么到定县城里去取款呢？
    “您家离县城有多远？” 
    “八十多里！”
    “那取款方便吗？”
    “不方便有啥办法，过去都是这样寄法，已经好几年啦！”
    卜仲于拿起了“局名表”说：这回选个离家近些的取款局吧！这么着，我念给您听，听到哪个地方离您家近您就说话。于是她就念：清风店、李亲顾、车站……“得啦！就这里吧！离家还不到二里路。”老大爷高兴地说着。“您再往下听听，是不是还有更近的呢？”卜仲于又继续念了下去：寨西店、砖路……
    “行啦！行啦！到家门口啦！还不到一里路。”老大爷高兴的阻拦着。这时，卜仲于拿起了钢笔刷刷地给老大爷开了汇票，又给贴好了邮票，办理了挂号手续，将收据、回执一并递给了老大爷手里。这时，老大爷向卜仲于微笑地问道：“同志！你贵姓？”“我姓卜，叫卜仲于。”老大爷望着卜仲于圆圆的面孔称赞道：真是“名不虚传。”
    原来这位老大爷是住在桥东区长寿街的。过去寄信、汇款都是在附近的桥东局。这次老大爷在报纸上看到了表扬卜仲于服务态度好的文章，特地坐着公共汽车到这里来汇款的。
