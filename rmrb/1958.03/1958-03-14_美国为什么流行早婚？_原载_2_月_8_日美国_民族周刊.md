Why is Early Marriage Popular in the United States?

Since the end of World War II, there has been an obvious tendency to return to early marriage, especially among the growing number of college students.

In my opinion, there are three main factors related to this issue. First, generally speaking, are cultural and historical factors; second are psychological factors, largely due to family reasons; and third are moral factors.

**The Spiritual Emptiness of Youth**

This generation of students has no figures to admire, no aspirations, no beliefs, and no enthusiasm.

We are now in a state of spiritual emptiness, which has been forming for some time.

Today's young people find that another idol of America's past is untenable: the supremacy of work. Today's generation rarely has a sense of vocation. According to the editors of "Fortune" magazine, the necessary condition for success is the willingness to sacrifice oneself on the altar of large corporations. This prospect cannot entice many young people.

What does all this have to do with early marriage? Simply this: the only meaningful place in life seems to be the family. The real goal of young men and women in the mid-twentieth century is to find a suitable partner, establish a happy marriage, and raise happy and well-adjusted children.

Today, the younger generation sees the family as a haven from the increasingly totalitarian demands of business and careers.

The precariousness of contemporary life makes this self-gratification through early marriage even more urgent. There is a "eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die" philosophy. In an era when intercontinental ballistic missiles and radioactive particles may cause ominous consequences, who knows how many days we have left? Therefore, the strong tendency to make the most of our remaining lives is entirely understandable.

**Lack of Family Warmth**

The second factor I call psychological. This is largely due to the lack of satisfactory kinship in upper-middle-class families today. Anyone who engages in extensive conversations with today's college students will be repeatedly shocked by the tension that exists between students and their parents. In many family relationships, there is little natural atmosphere and genuine human warmth; a contrived tone makes family relationships hollow and unsatisfying.

In short, relationships are so strained that children look for substitutes for their parents. These substitutes, unlike in the past, are not found in teachers (because all adults are suspect), but in dating friends of the opposite sex, who serve as parent, confidant, confessional priest, and arbitrator all in one. He (or she) does not want to be alone. Therefore, the basic needs not met at home become the reason for a strong desire to establish their own family as soon as possible.

**Marriage is Not a Safe Haven**

The third factor leading to increased early marriage is a moral one.

Sometimes, intimate actions arouse uncontrollable passions, defying even the greatest determination. Desires have not diminished, and early marriage provides a satisfactory solution. Now, conscience no longer feels uneasy; social disapproval ceases; then, even if there is a pregnancy, it is morally beyond reproach, although serious economic problems may arise. However, it can be almost certainly concluded that a union that treats marriage as an escape haven cannot guarantee complete success. The sad fact is that marriage rarely solves personal problems; it often adds to them.

    美国为什么流行早婚？
    原载2月8日美国“民族周刊”
    威廉学院宗教系主任  柯尔
    自从第二次世界大战结束以来，显而易见存在着一种恢复早婚的倾向，特别是在人数不断增加的大学生中。
    在我看来，同这个问题有关的主要因素有三。第一，一般而论，是文化和历史上的因素；第二是心理上的因素，在很大程度上由于家庭的原因；第三是道德上的因素。
    青年的精神空虚
    这一代学生没有所崇拜的人物，没有抱负，没有信仰，也没有热情。
    我们现在处在一种精神空虚的状态中，这种情况若干时候以来一直是在形成中。
    今天的青年人发现美国过去的另一偶象是站不住脚的：工作至上。今天这一代人很少有职业感。据“幸福”杂志的编者说，成功的必要条件是愿意在大公司的祭坛上把自己当作牺牲。这种前景不能引诱很多的青年人。
    所有这一切与早婚有什么关系呢？无非是：生命中唯一有意义的地方看来就是家庭了。二十世纪中叶的青年男女的真正目标是找一个合适的对象，缔结美满的婚姻和养育愉快而适应环境的孩子。
    今天，年青一代认为家庭是逃避商业和职业上日益极权主义化的要求的安乐窝。
    当代生活中朝不保夕的状况使得这件以早婚来自我满足的事更感迫切。这里含有一种“今日有酒今日醉”的哲学。在洲际弹道导弹和放射性微粒可能引起不祥后果的时代里，谁知道我们还能活多少日子？因此，尽量利用我们的余生这种强烈的倾向是完全可以理解的。
    缺乏家庭温暖
    第二个因素我称为是心理上的。这大半是由于现在上层中产阶级的家庭里没有令人满意的亲属关系。任何一个和今天的大学生进行广泛交谈的人会一再因学生和家长之间存在的紧张关系而感到震惊。在许多家庭关系里很少有自然的气氛和真正的人情温暖；一种矫揉造作的调子使得家庭关系空洞和令人不能满意。
    总而言之，关系紧张到了这样的地步，以致于孩子寻找代替家长的人。这种代替的人，不像过去那样，到老师身上去找（因为所有的成人都是可疑的），而从约会出游的异性朋友身上去找，他（她）身兼家长、知己、听忏悔的牧师和公断人四个角色。他（她）不甘寂寞。所以，在父母家里基本需要未能满足成了强烈地希望尽早建立自己家庭的原因。
    结婚不是安乐窝
    第三个导使早婚增加的因素是道德的因素。
    有时候，亲热的举动引起无法控制的情欲，最大的决心也置之不顾了。欲望没有减退，而早婚提供了圆满的解决方法。现在，良心不再感到不安了；社会的不满舆论也停止了；那么，即使是怀孕了，在道德上也是无可訾议的，虽然，可能出现严重的经济问题。但是，几乎可以断定：把结婚当作逃避的安乐窝的结合不能保证完全成功。可悲的事实是：结婚很少能解决个人的问题；倒往往是增加了问题。
