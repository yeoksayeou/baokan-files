Seeing with New Eyes

"A scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes." The "scholar" mentioned here refers to intellectuals, the intellectual class. In fact, the phrase "seeing with new eyes" is particularly worth quoting today to describe our country's farmers. It is still unthinkable to many that the farmers of Pingyuan in Liaoyang County would shoulder their tools and go up the mountains to help the farmers on the barren hills of Guangshan with production and construction for a period of time. This is because they have always regarded farmers as representatives of conservatism and shortsightedness. However, the farmers of Liaoyang are not the image that these people have in their minds. They understand the spirit of collectivism, and they know that when the mountains are well managed, it will benefit both the mountainous areas and the plains, so they take the lead in managing the mountains. Shouldn't we "look at" such actions by the farmers of Liaoyang "with new eyes"? Doesn't this incident only illustrate Liaoyang, but also the new changes in the 500 million farmers under the leadership of the Communist Party!

    刮目相看
    “士别三日当刮目相看”，这里说的“士”，是读书人，是知识阶级。其实，“刮目相看”这句话，今天特别值得引用来写照我国的农民。辽阳县平原农民扛起自己的工具，上山帮助光山秃岭上的农民搞一个时期生产建设，这在许多人还是想不到的。因为他们一直是把农民看成是守旧、近视的代表。但是，辽阳的农民并不是这些人头脑中想像的样子，他们懂得集体精神，他们知道治好了山对山区平原都有好处的时候，便首先出动治山。难道辽阳农民这种举动我们不应当“刮目相看”么？难道这件事情只说明辽阳而不能说明在共产党领导下的五亿农民的新变化么！
