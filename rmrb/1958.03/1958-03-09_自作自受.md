    Hoist with Their Own Petard
    According to a report by the German News Agency, the dispute between Britain and West Germany over troop maintenance costs has been "successfully" resolved. That is, "West Germany will repay the total amount of 45 million pounds in British post-war aid in one lump sum, instead of paying it in annual installments." The so-called "successful resolution" turns out to be West Germany returning the money it borrowed from Britain to Britain. After all the quarreling, Britain ended up getting its own money back.
    Not long ago, West Germany proposed depositing 100 million pounds in Britain without interest as an advance payment for purchasing military supplies, instead of paying troop maintenance fees. As a result, the British newspapers were very indignant, saying that it "seems like throwing a penny into the hat of a persistent beggar." Now it seems that West Germany is not even throwing a penny, and Britain has no choice but to take back its own "hat."
    Britain has fallen to this point, and it can only blame itself for implementing the self-inflicted North Atlantic policy.

    自作自受
    据德意志新闻社报道，英国和西德在驻军维持费上的争吵已经“成功”地解决了。那就是“由西德一次全数付还英国战后援助总额四千五百万英镑，而不实行每年分期付还”。所谓“成功解决”原来就是西德把借英国的钱还给英国。吵了半天英国拿到的还是英国自己的钱。
    不久前西德提出拿一亿英镑不收利息地存放英国作为购买军火预付款项，来代替驻军维持费。结果英国报纸大为忿然，说这“好像向缠绕不休的乞丐的帽子里投一个铜板”。现在看来西德连一个铜板也不投了，而英国还不能不收回自己的“帽子”。
    英国沦落到这种地步，这只能怪英国执行了自作自受的北大西洋政策。
