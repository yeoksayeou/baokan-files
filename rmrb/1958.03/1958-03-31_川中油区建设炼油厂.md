Xinhua News Agency, Nanchong, March 30th: The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau has decided to build three sets of kettle-type distillation equipment with an annual output of 1,000 tons of gasoline in the central Sichuan oil region. The design work has now been completed, and engineering technicians are selecting a site in the oil region.

The construction of this batch of oil refining equipment in the central Sichuan oil region is for on-site processing of crude oil spewing from existing exploration wells. In the absence of oil refining equipment, the oil region has recently shipped the first batch of crude oil to factories in Chongqing and other places for refining.

The design of these three sets of kettle-type distillation equipment is simple and can be built by making the most of existing equipment, materials, and used equipment. The investment for each set of equipment is less than 10,000 yuan, and it can be put into production in two to three months.

    川中油区建设炼油厂
    据新华社南充30日电　四川石油勘探局决定在川中油区建设三套年产一千吨汽油的釜式蒸馏设备。现在，设计工作已经完成，工程技术人员正在油区选择厂址。
    川中油区建设这批炼油设备，是为了就地加工现有探井喷出的原油。在目前尚无炼油设备的情况下，油区最近已经运出了第一批原油到重庆等地工厂炼制。
    这三套釜式蒸馏设备的设计简单，可以尽量利用现有设备材料和废旧器材建成。每套设备投资不到一万元，两三个月就可投入生产。
