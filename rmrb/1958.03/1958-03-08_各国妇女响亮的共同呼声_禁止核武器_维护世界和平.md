Celebrating the "March 8th" Festival for Women Worldwide
The Loud Common Voice of Women in Various Countries
Ban Nuclear Weapons, Maintain World Peace

Due to the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism pursuing a policy of frantic arms expansion and war preparation, and creating international tension, the struggle of people from various countries demanding disarmament, banning nuclear weapons, stopping the threat of war and defending peace is rising. Women from various countries have actively participated in this important struggle, demonstrating the great strength and firm will of women in defending peace.

In Europe, U.S. imperialism is forcing member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to establish U.S. missile bases; U.S. planes carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs fly over some Western European countries all day long; at the same time, the U.S. is stepping up equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. These facts have caused extreme anxiety among the people of European countries, especially women and mothers. British women bravely participated in the British people's demonstrations demanding "Yankee Go Home!" and demanded that the Macmillan government stop hydrogen bomb tests and hold a summit meeting between East and West. British women, participating in the "March for Life" anti-hydrogen bomb parade, carried hundreds of signs that read: "The value of one hydrogen bomb can build 25,000 houses, 50 hospitals, and 600 nurseries." In West Germany, eighteen women's organizations last year demanded a halt to nuclear weapons testing around the world and suggested a gradual and supervised reduction of armaments. In France, women from various places have constantly written letters, telegrams and submitted petitions to French Prime Minister Gaillard, demanding that no U.S. missile bases be built on French territory, and that atomic weapons not be supplied to West Germany. The Italian Women's Union, in an appeal to women across the country, pointed out: "The arms race, the construction of missile bases, and the manufacture of nuclear weapons bring the specter of war to Europe." The Italian Women's Union is determined to mobilize women across the country to demand that the government reduce military spending and demand a summit meeting between East and West. In Northeastern Europe, women and women's organizations in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and other countries have petitioned the government or written to the United Nations to express their urgent desire to ban nuclear weapons.

Although the women's organizations in the above-mentioned countries have different political positions, as the appeal of the women's department of the Austrian "United Nations Society" said: "We are united with women all over the world in the demand to stop atomic and hydrogen bomb explosions."

In Australia and the Americas, the voices of women against nuclear weapons are also rising. Women in Sydney, Australia, held protest marches, holding up flags that read "Stop Hydrogen Bomb Tests!" and "Save the Children!" In Canada and Latin American countries, women constantly appeal to government ministers, members of parliament and scientists, or collect signatures to express their desire for peace. The movement initiated by the Permanent Committee of Women Workers of Mexico, calling for countries possessing atomic and hydrogen bombs to immediately stop testing, has aroused the response of tens of thousands of people, because Mexico is closest to the United States, which produces atomic bombs and constantly conducts tests, and the cloud of atomic radiation covers the sky of Mexico. The Women's Congress of Canada wrote to Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker and all members of parliament, saying: "We ask you to safeguard Canada's sovereignty and immediately stop U.S. planes carrying hydrogen bombs from flying over our sacred land." In the United States, the movement for peace by women is also flourishing. The U.S. Women's International League for Peace and Freedom recently sent a delegation to the White House to deliver a letter signed by 10,000 people, demanding an end to nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.

The movement of women in Asian and African countries against atomic weapons is constantly developing. The heroic and steadfast struggle of Japanese women against atomic weapons, who have suffered three atomic disasters, has won the respect of women around the world. The Third Mothers' Congress held by Japanese women in August 1957 focused on the ardent wishes and determination of Japanese mothers to oppose atomic weapons and defend their children. Women from all walks of life in Japan also actively selected representatives to attend the Third World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in Tokyo at that time, bringing together the strength of Japanese women and the Japanese people with the people of various countries to form a torrent of defending peace. Women in India, Indonesia, Ceylon and Pakistan are also actively participating in the struggle to demand the banning of atomic weapons. The All-India Women's Conference, at its annual meeting held in December last year, passed a resolution demanding a halt to nuclear explosions. Indonesian women established the "Mothers' Association Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb Movement" in August last year. Women from various countries in the Middle East and Africa actively participated in the heroic struggle against colonialism and for national independence. They angrily condemned the Eisenhower Doctrine, opposed the Baghdad Pact, and demanded a ban on the use of atomic weapons.

Women in the socialist camp countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have consistently regarded actively participating in the construction of their motherland and enhancing the strength to defend peace as their most precious contribution to world peace. They also warmly support the various peace initiatives and peace measures of their governments; at the same time, they also firmly support the struggles of women from various countries to demand the banning of nuclear weapons and the defense of world peace. Recently, the Soviet Women's Committee issued an appeal, supporting the Soviet government's measures to reduce troops and peace proposals, expressing the sincere wishes for peace of thousands of Soviet women. Due to U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea, and recently openly undermining the armistice agreement and sending atomic weapons into South Korea, Korean women have issued an appeal to women around the world, demanding that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea and achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is another important action of Korean women to defend peace and oppose atomic war.

Chinese women have always actively participated in the struggle against nuclear weapons and for the defense of world peace together with women from various countries. Now, Chinese women are taking practical actions to actively promote the socialist construction of their motherland as a gift to the world peace movement.

### 各国妇女响亮的共同呼声  禁止核武器　维护世界和平

    庆祝“三八”全世界妇女的节日
    各国妇女响亮的共同呼声
    禁止核武器　维护世界和平
    由于以美帝国主义为首的战争势力奉行着疯狂的扩军备战政策，制造国际紧张局势，世界各国人民要求裁减军备、禁止核武器、制止战争威胁和保卫和平的斗争正日益高涨。各国妇女积极地参加了这一重大斗争，显示了妇女的保卫和平的伟大力量和坚强意志。
    在欧洲，美帝国主义正在迫使北大西洋集团的成员国建立美国导弹基地；载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机，整天在西欧一些国家上空飞行；同时，美国正加紧用原子武器装备西德军队，这些事实引起了欧洲各国人民，特别是妇女和母亲们的极度不安。英国妇女英勇地参加了英国人民要求“美国佬滚回去！”的示威运动，并要求麦克米伦政府停止氢弹试验，举行东西方最高级会议。英国妇女在参加反氢弹的“生命的进军”大游行时，打着数以百计的标语牌，上面写着：“一颗氢弹的价值，可以建筑二万五千幢住宅，五十所医院，六百个托儿所。”在西德，去年有十八个妇女组织要求在世界各地停止核武器试验，并建议实行逐步有监督的裁减军  备。在法国，各地妇女曾不断写信、打电报和送交请愿书给法国总理盖伊阿，要求不在法国境内建立美国导弹基地，不把原子武器供给西德。意大利妇女联盟在一封给全国妇女的呼吁书中指出：“军备竞赛、导弹基地的建筑和核武器的制造，给欧洲带来了战争景象。”意大利妇女联盟决心动员全国妇女要求政府缩减军费，要求召开东西方最高级会议。东北欧，瑞典、丹麦、挪威、冰岛等国的妇女和妇女组织纷纷向政府请愿或写信给联合国来表达她们要求禁止核武器的迫切愿望。
    尽管上述国家的妇女组织有着不同的政治立场，但正如奥地利的“联合国同志会”妇女部的呼吁书上所说的：“在停止原子弹和氢弹爆炸这一要求上，我们同全世界妇女是一致的。”
    在澳洲和美洲，妇女们反对核武器的呼声也日益高涨。澳大利亚悉尼的妇女曾高举着“停止氢弹试验！”“救救孩子！”的旗子，举行抗议游行。在加拿大和拉丁美洲各国，妇女不断向政府部长、国会议员和科学家们呼吁或征集签名来表达她们的和平愿望。墨西哥女工常设委员会发起的拥有原子弹氢弹的国家立即停止试验的运动，引起成千成万的人的响应，因为墨西哥离生产原子弹并不断进行试验的美国最近，原子辐射的乌云笼罩了墨西哥的天空。加拿大妇女大会写信给加总理迪芬贝克和全体议员说：“要求你们保障加拿大的主权，立即制止带有氢弹的美国飞机在我国神圣的土地的上空飞行”。在美国，妇女争取和平的运动同样在蓬勃开展着。美国妇女争取和平自由国际联盟不久前曾派遣一个代表团到白宫去递了一个一万人签名的信，要求停止在太平洋进行核武器试验。
    亚非各国妇女反对原子武器的运动不断地发展。曾经遭受过三次原子灾难的日本妇女反对原子武器的英勇而坚毅的斗争，博得世界妇女的敬重。1957年8月间日本妇女召开的第三次母亲大会，集中了日本母亲们反对原子武器、保卫孩子的热烈愿望和决心。日本各界妇女还积极选派代表出席了当时在东京举行的第三届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，使日本妇女和日本人民和各国人民的力量汇成一支保卫和平的洪流。印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰和巴基斯坦妇女也积极参加要求禁止原子武器的斗争。全印妇女会议在去年12月举行的年会上，通过了要求停止核子爆炸的决议。印度尼西亚妇女去年8月成立了“母亲反对原子弹、氢弹运动协会”。中近东和非洲的各国妇女积极参加了反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的英勇斗争，她们愤怒地谴责艾森豪威尔主义，反对巴格达条约，要求禁止使用原子武器。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国妇女，一贯以积极参加祖国的建设、增强保卫和平的力量，作为她们对世界和平最珍贵的贡献。她们并热烈拥护本国政府的各项和平倡议和和平措施；同时，她们也坚决支持各国妇女要求禁止核武器和保卫世界和平的斗争。最近苏联妇女委员会曾发表呼吁书，拥护苏联政府裁减军队的措施和和平建议，表达了千千万万苏联妇女对和平的真诚愿望。由于美帝国主义霸占朝鲜南部，最近并公然破坏停战协定，把原子武器送进南朝鲜，朝鲜妇女向世界各国妇女发出了呼吁，要求美军撤出南朝鲜，实现朝鲜的和平统一。这是朝鲜妇女保卫和平、反对原子战争的又一重要行动。
    我国妇女一向同各国妇女一起积极参加反对核武器和保卫世界和平的斗争。现在，我国妇女正以积极促进祖国的社会主义建设的实际行动，作为向世界保卫和平运动的献礼。
