    To do anything well, one must first clear away ideological obstacles. The more thoroughly ideological obstacles are cleared, the better things will be done.

    The current "Two Antis" movement is in full swing across the country. In the cultural and educational fields, the situation is no exception, and many units have also launched relatively deep criticism and self-criticism. Some professors at Peking University have spoken out about things they have kept in their hearts for many years, which is a good phenomenon. This shows that the broad masses have a relatively deep understanding of the significance of the "Two Antis" movement. But have the problems been exposed deeply and thoroughly enough? Have all the ideological obstacles been cleared? We cannot say that yet.

    Some people have spread some right-leaning remarks in the past and have been criticized. After the "Two Antis" movement started, their idea is that "more talk invites trouble," so it's best to say less. Some people have some shortcomings in their work and estimate that others will criticize them, so they have a feeling of waiting to be rectified. Some people are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, value relationships, and are afraid of offending people, so they have always "only said three-tenths of what's on their minds" and are not used to telling the whole truth, let alone writing big-character posters. Some people have difficulties in their work that they cannot solve for the time being, and they are afraid that others will say they are "backward" if they talk about the difficulties in their work, so their enthusiasm and confidence are not high. Some Party comrades, living a Party life for a long time, have become accustomed to speaking frankly within the Party, but are hesitant to speak in front of the masses. These are all ideological obstacles, hindering thorough airing of views and deeper exposure of problems.

    It should be recognized that: First, today's "Two Antis" movement is to resolve contradictions among the people, in order to make work leap forward. "More talk" is beneficial to work and will never "invite trouble." Second, everyone has shortcomings in their work. Although shortcomings are big and small, it is ultimately a matter of nine fingers and one finger. If one finger is sick, it must be treated quickly. The masses are the doctors. On the one hand, we must "ignite the fire to burn ourselves" and cure this finger; on the other hand, we must devote ourselves to the mass movement to cure other people's diseases. Third, "only saying three-tenths of what's on one's mind" is the tragedy of private ownership societies. In that society, people had selfish motives and distrusted each other, so they had to "only say three-tenths of what's on one's mind." Today is a society of collective ownership and public ownership. Any shortcoming is harmful to everyone; any progress is beneficial to everyone. We must speak freely, praise the good, and criticize the bad, so that work can leap forward. Fourth, what should be the attitude towards difficulties for people who have difficulties in their work? If there are difficulties, the masses should know, and the leadership should know. Some difficulties can be solved by mobilizing the masses, and some difficulties can be solved with the assistance of the leadership. Don't let difficulties hold you back and keep you out of the movement. Fifth, for Party comrades, it should be recognized that things should be discussed with the masses. In the past, in the acute class struggle, centralization should have been greater, and not everything could be discussed with the masses. Today, the class enemies in the country have been basically eliminated. Except for a few business secrets and special personnel issues, all can be raised in the masses for public discussion.

    The "Two Antis" movement is developing vigorously, but do not be satisfied with the current booming situation. Take a deep look and analyze whether the ideological obstacles have been completely eliminated.

    还有思想障碍
    李梓
    任何事情要想作好，必须首先扫清思想障碍。思想障碍清除得越彻底，事情也就作得越好。
    目前全国的双反运动，正热火朝天。在文教方面，情况也不例外，许多单位还展开了比较深刻的批评和自我批评。北大有些教授把长年放在心里的话，也说了出来，这是个好现象。这说明广大群众对双反运动的意义有了比较深刻的认识。但是问题揭露得是不是已经很深很透了呢？思想障碍是不是已经都扫除了呢？还不能这样说。
    有些人过去散布过一些右倾情绪的言论，受到过批判。双反运动起来以后，他的想法是“多言惹祸”，还是少说为妙。有些人自己工作上有一些缺点，估计别人会批评到自己，有等着挨整的情绪。有些人受了较深的资产阶级思想影响，顾情面，怕得罪人，向来就“逢人只说三分话”，不习惯于把心里话全说出来，更不习惯于写出大字报来，有的人工作上有困难，自己一时又解决不了，谈自己工作上的困难，又怕人家说“落后”，所以热情信心也不高。有些党员同志，长期过党的生活，使他习惯于在党内无话不讲，而在群众面前说话就有所顾忌。这些都是思想障碍，障碍着彻底鸣放，更深入地揭露问题。
    应当认识：第一，今天的双反运动是解决人民内部矛盾，是为了使工作跃进。“多言”对工作有利，决不会“惹祸”。第二，工作缺点人人都有，虽然缺点有大有小，但是，那究竟是九个手指与一个手指的问题。一个手指有了病要赶快医。群众就是医生。一方面要引火烧身，医好这个手指头；一方面要投入群众运动，去医别人的病。第三，“逢人只说三分话”，那是私有制社会的悲剧。在那个社会里，人和人互有私心，互不信任，只好“逢人只说三分话”。今天是集体所有制和全民所有制的社会了，任何一点缺点，都对大家有害；任何一点进步都对大家有利，必须畅所欲言，好的要表扬，坏的要批评，才能使工作大跃进。第四，有的人工作上有困难，对待困难应当是什么态度呢？有困难就应当让群众知道，让领导上知道。有些困难发动了群众就可以解决，有些困难领导上知道了就会协助解决，不要因为困难拖住自己，置身运动之外。第五，对党员同志来说，应当认识到有事和群众商量。过去，在尖锐的阶级斗争中，集中应当多一些，不能事事和群众商量。今天，国内的阶级敌人已基本消灭，除了少数业务机密和特殊的人事问题以外，都可以在群众中提出来公开讨论。
    双反运动正在蓬勃地开展着，但是，不要满足于现有的轰轰烈烈。深入地观察分析一下吧，思想障碍是不是彻底消除了。
