How is the Spring Ploughing Preparation Going?
Responsible Cadres from Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan Provinces Go to the Countryside for Inspection

　　This newspaper reports comprehensively: Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces have organized inspection teams, led by responsible cadres themselves, to go to various places to inspect agricultural production and rural work.

　　The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Inspection Team, led by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Pinghua, Secretary, including more than 100 responsible comrades from directors and section chiefs of provincial departments and bureaus, has been formed. They will go to six districts throughout the province to comprehensively inspect spring ploughing preparations, the growth of summer crops, and the ideological style and working methods of cadres.

　　Jiangxi Province, headed by the Provincial Party Secretary, Governor, and Deputy Governor, has organized the first batch of spring plowing preparation inspection groups, which have arrived in various places one after another. Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, told everyone before the inspection team set off, especially emphasizing two inspection methods: one is the method of "glancing over the flowers while riding a horse", covering a wider area, but with a certain center, and conducting some investigation and research work; the other method is to delve deeper to find typical experiences, summarize them in a timely manner after discovering them, and promote them in a timely manner.

　　The Hunan Provincial Party Committee First Secretary Zhou Xiaozhou, Secretariat Secretaries Zhou Hui, Tan Yubao, Xu Qiwen, Hu Jizong, Li Ruishan and responsible cadres of local committees jointly formed a spring ploughing production inspection team to conduct large-scale inspections in batches to various places using a method that combines leadership and the masses. They plan to conduct large-scale evaluation and competition through inspections, summarize and exchange experiences, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and promote all parties to do a good job in preparing for spring ploughing.

    春耕工作准备得怎样了？
    湖北江西湖南三省负责干部纷纷去农村检查
    本报综合报道　湖北、江西、湖南等省组织检查团，由负责干部亲自领导分赴各地检查农业生产和农村工作。
    由中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、书记张平化同志率领，包括全省厅局长及处长以上负责同志一百多人的湖北省农业检查团已经组成。他们将分赴全省六个专区全面检查春耕准备、夏收作物的生长和干部思想作风、工作方法等。
    江西省以省委书记、省长、副省长为首，组织的第一批备耕工作检查组，先后到达各地。省委第一书记杨尚奎同志在检查团出发前，曾告诉大家特别强调两种检查方法：一种是“走马看花”、面走宽些的方法，但要有一定中心，并作些调查研究工作；另一种方法就是深入一点摸典型经验，发现后及时总结，及时推广。
    中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟、书记处书记周惠、谭余保、徐启文、胡继宗、李瑞山和各地委负责干部共同组成春耕生产检查团，分批到各地采取领导与群众相结合的办法进行大检查。他们准备通过检查开展大规模的评比竞赛，总结交流经验，及时发现与解决问题，推动各方面的力量作好备耕工作。
