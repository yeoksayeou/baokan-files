Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 8th: On the Qinghai grasslands, pastoral production cooperatives and joint state-private ranches are springing up like mushrooms after rain. As of mid-February, the province has newly established 117 pastoral cooperatives and 21 joint state-private ranches this year. In the Aquhu District of Xinghai County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture alone, the number of pastoral households participating in cooperatives and ranches has reached 83.3% of the total number of pastoral households.

At present, in key areas where cooperative construction is being carried out, the enthusiasm of the herders, especially the poor herders, is very high. Many herders are automatically gathering their tents and jointly requesting to set up cooperatives. Some herdowners, seeing the general trend and the will of the people, are also requesting to establish joint state-private ranches.

    青海草原好春光
    据新华社西宁8日电　在青海草原上，牧业生产合作社和公私合营牧场如雨后春笋般一个跟着一个出现了。截至2月中旬，全省今年已新建牧业社一百一十七个，公私合营牧场二十一个。仅海南藏族自治州兴海县阿曲乎区，参加社、场的牧户达到了总牧户的83.3％。
    现在，在开展建社工作的重点地区，牧民群众特别是贫苦牧民的热情很高。不少牧民自动集中帐房，联名要求办社。有些牧主看见大势所趋，人心所向，也要求建立公私合营牧场。
