    To Reduce Market Trips for the Sake of Production
    JiangLe county, Fujian province, recently changed its fair days from once every five days to once every ten days. The county's thirteen market places can therefore save 140,000 labor days within a year. The grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives in these areas have also set up sales agencies according to the needs of the masses' production and life, and organized peddlers to regularly sell various goods door-to-door in various villages, so as to ensure that changing the market schedule does not affect the masses' buying and selling needs.

    为了生产少赶集
    福建将乐县最近把历来五天一次的墟集，改变成十天一墟。全县十三个墟场一年内因此即可节省出十四万个劳动日。这些地区的基层供销社也根据群众生产、生活的需要，设立代销点，组织货郎队，定期到各乡村沿门兜售各种货物，做到改墟期不影响群众买卖需要。
