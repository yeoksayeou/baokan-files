Ghana's Independence Anniversary
Chen Tian

    On this day last year, the people of the Gold Coast in West Africa, freed from British colonial rule, declared independence. This newly independent nation was named after the ancient black kingdom – Ghana.
    Ghana's independence is the result of the long and heroic struggle of the Ghanaian people against colonialism, so they deeply cherish their independence. During the independence celebrations, Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah pointed out: "Now that we have gained freedom, the first and most important thing we must do is to very carefully protect this independence." Over the past year, the central government of Ghana has undergone several adjustments and enrichments, and the new nation is increasingly consolidated. In terms of local government, before independence, Ghana (Gold Coast) implemented a system of local governors formulated by colonialists and staffed by Europeans. After independence, this "system reeking of colonialism" was abolished. In October last year, the Ghanaian government appointed five ministerial-level regional commissioners, representing the central government and stationed in the five major administrative regions, responsible for leading the work in each region. The Ghanaian government also decided to implement compulsory military service to establish a national defense volunteer army. Ghana's own navy is also being planned for construction.
    Ghana is a rich country. It ranks fourth in the world in gold production. Bauxite reserves are even more abundant, estimated at 220 million tons, enough for 200 years if 250,000 tons of aluminum are produced annually. As for cocoa production, it has always ranked first in the world. However, all of this was controlled by the colonialists before independence. In order to heal the wounds left by the long-term colonial rule, shortly after independence, the Ghanaian government decided to implement a transitional two-year "Consolidation and Development Plan" starting in July 1957, with an estimated investment of £18,615,501. The plan includes the construction of a giant dam and hydroelectric power station on the Volta River in the Ajena area, with a power generation capacity of 575,000 kilowatts. Using this electricity, nearby bauxite can be developed to refine aluminum, estimated to produce about 200,000 tons of aluminum annually. After the completion of this project, Ghana's economy will be greatly changed, which will help to get rid of the current reliance on the single agricultural crop of cocoa.
    In order to develop the economy in a more planned way, the Ghanaian government established the "Development Commission" starting from July 1 last year. Then, on August 21, the "Bank of Ghana" and the "Ghana Commercial Bank" were officially opened, and it was decided to issue Ghana's own banknotes starting in July this year. At the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Nkrumah said: "Unless Ghana's independence leads to economic and financial progress, Ghana's political independence is meaningless." As for the funds for Ghana's development, Prime Minister Nkrumah said: Ghana's own national or private savings can be used, and funds from foreign governments, companies or individuals can also be absorbed. At the same time, he also pointed out: "We would be foolish if we simply relied on foreign capital to supply our undertakings. In the long run, our progress must depend on the correct use of our own resources."
    Due to the active implementation of the above-mentioned policies for developing the national economy, Ghana has made considerable achievements in social progress and economic development over the past year. Training stations for housing construction, motor installation, and carpentry have been established in various regions to cultivate local technical talents. Ghana's own shipping company – "Black Star Line" has also been established, and its first ship "Volta" has begun sailing. The Ghanaian government is now preparing to establish an airline and an insurance company. The "Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board" has also been reorganized. The foreign enterprise "Cocoa Purchasing Company," which formerly handled procurement business, has been removed, and the procurement work of the bureau is now undertaken by Ghana's own enterprise "Ghana Farmers Trading Association."
    Ghana pursues a peaceful and friendly foreign policy. Prime Minister Nkrumah said: "Our foreign policy will be based on the three words: dignity, peace, and friendship." He pointed out: Ghana does not participate in any national group or political group, resolutely safeguards Ghana's national independence, and hopes to maintain friendly relations with Commonwealth countries and other freedom-loving countries. In African affairs, it will strive to enable all Africans to benefit and progress in the process of pursuing freedom and social progress.
    After independence, Ghana has established diplomatic relations with eleven countries, including the Soviet Union, India, and the United Kingdom, and has joined the United Nations. At the 12th United Nations General Assembly, the Ghanaian representative voted in favor of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, in favor of banning the testing of atomic weapons, advocating inviting democratic Korea to send representatives to the United Nations to discuss the Korean issue, advocating discussing Syria's accusations against Turkey, approving the right of self-determination of the Algerian people, advocating peaceful coexistence of all countries, and using the Five Principles to consolidate world peace.
    Ghana is a participant in the Bandung Conference. After independence, it has become more actively involved in the international movement against colonialism and for world peace. When the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the 19th International Red Cross Conference, the Asian-African Women's Conference, and the 6th World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship were held, the Ghanaian people sent their own representatives to participate.
    Ghana's independence and the achievements made in various aspects after independence are a great encouragement to the people of various countries in Africa, especially West Africa, who are struggling for national independence. Shortly after Ghana's independence, on April 17, 1957, the leaders of the three regions of Nigeria with different political views issued a joint communique, unanimously demanding independence in 1959. Although this request was unreasonably rejected by the British colonial authorities, the Nigerian people's independence movement was even more launched. In May, the people of Sierra Leone also voiced their desire to be independent in 1960, and called their leader "the Nkrumah of Sierra Leone."
    The colonialists are unwilling to lose their colonial interests and are even more hostile to the victories achieved by the colonial people after gaining independence. When Ghana successfully defends its sovereignty and builds its nation, British newspapers viciously attack and slander Ghana's various measures to safeguard independence and sovereignty, and the colonialists' agents in Ghana also carry out subversive and destructive activities at the same time, but the Ghanaian government has not been intimidated by these. On December 3, 1957, the Ghanaian Parliament passed an emergency bill granting the government special powers to deal with riots or acts of violence. Some elements engaged in destructive activities have been deported from Ghana by the Ghanaian government.
    Undoubtedly, there will still be many difficulties in front of the young Ghana. However, the light of national independence has illuminated the African continent, and the lifespan of colonialism is numbered. We believe that with the support of peace and justice forces around the world, the united Ghanaian people will be able to overcome difficulties from all sides and make their motherland increasingly prosperous and strong.

    加纳独立一周年
    陈田
    去年今天，非洲西部黄金海岸人民，摆脱了英国的殖民统治，宣布独立了。这个新独立的国家，以黑人古国的名字——加纳命名。
    加纳获得独立，是加纳人民同殖民主义者进行长期英勇斗争的结果，因此他们非常珍惜自己的独立。加纳总理恩克鲁玛在独立庆典期间就曾经指出：“现在我们已经获得了自由，我们必须作的第一件事情、也是最重要的一件事情，就是要非常小心地保卫这种独立。”一年来，加纳中央政府经过了数次调整和充实，新的国家日益巩固。在地方政权方面，独立前，加纳（黄金海岸）实行着一种由殖民主义者制订的、由欧洲人担任的地方长官制度。独立后，这种“散发着殖民主义臭气的制度”被废除了。去年10月间，加纳政府任命了五位部长级的地区专员，代表中央政府分驻五大行政区，负责领导各地区的工作。加纳政府还决定实行义务兵役制，建立一支国防义勇军。加纳自己的海军也正在计划兴建。
    加纳是一个富饶的国家。黄金产量居世界第四位。铁矾土的蕴藏量更为丰富，据估计共有二万二千万吨，如果每年产铝二十五万吨，足够二百年之用。至于可可的产量，更一向居世界第一。可是，这一切，在独立前一直为殖民主义者所控制。为了医治殖民主义长期统治所留下的创伤，独立后不久，加纳政府就决定从1957年7月开始实行一个过渡性质的为期二年的“巩固发展计划”，投资估计为一千八百六十一万五千五百零一英镑。计划的内容，包括在伏尔达河上、阿真纳地区修建巨型的水坝和水电站，发电能力为五十七万五千瓩。利用这些电力，可开发附近的铁矾土来炼铝，估计可以年产铝二十万吨左右。这项工程完成之后，加纳的经济将要大大改观，将有助于摆脱目前对单一农作物可可的依靠。
    为了更有计划地发展经济，从去年7月1日开始，加纳政府成立了“发展委员会”。接着，8月21日，“加纳银行”和“加纳商业银行”正式开幕，同时决定在今年7月开始发行加纳自己的纸币。在开幕仪式上，恩克鲁玛总理说：“除非加纳的独立导致经济的和财政的进步，否则，加纳的政治独立是没有意义的。”至于加纳发展事业的资金，恩克鲁玛总理说：可以使用加纳自己国家的或私人的积蓄，也可以吸收外国政府、公司或私人的资金。同时他也指出：“如果我们只是依靠外来的资本来供给我们的事业，我们将是愚蠢的。从长远打算，我们的进步必须依靠正确地运用我们自己的资源。”
    由于积极执行上述发展民族经济的政策，一年来，加纳在社会进步和经济发展方面取得了不少的成就。在各地区建立了房屋建筑、马达安装、木工等训练站，以培养本民族的技术人材。加纳自己的海运公司——“黑星海运公司”也建立起来了，它的第一只轮船“伏尔达号”已开始航行。加纳政府现正在着手筹建一个航空公司和保险公司。“加纳可可交易局”也进行了改组。从前担任采购业务的外国企业“可可采购公司”被撤除了，改由加纳自己的企业“加纳农民交易协会”承担该局的采购工作。
    加纳执行着和平、友好的外交政策。恩克鲁玛总理说：“我们的外交政策将以尊严、和平、友好这三个字为基础。”他指出：加纳不参加任何的国家集团或政治集团，坚决维护加纳的民族独立，希望与英联邦国家和其他爱好自由的国家保持友好的关系。在非洲事务方面，将致力使全体非洲人在追求自由和社会进步的过程中获得利益和进展。
    加纳独立后，已同苏联、印度、英国等十一个国家建立了外交关系，并且加入了联合国。在第十二届联合国大会上，加纳代表投票赞成恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位，赞成禁止试验原子武器，主张邀请民主朝鲜派代表参加联合国讨论朝鲜问题，主张讨论叙利亚对土耳其的控诉，赞成荷兰和印度尼西亚举行谈判解决西伊里安问题，承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权，主张各国和平共处，以五项原则来巩固世界和平。
    加纳是万隆会议的参加国。独立以后，它更加积极地参与国际反对殖民主义和争取世界和平的运动。亚非人民团结大会、第十九届国际红十字大会、亚非妇女会议和第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节等集会举行时，加纳人民都派有自己的代表参加。
    加纳的独立和独立后在各方面所取得的成就，对非洲特别是西非地区的正在为争取民族独立而斗争的各国人民是一个很大的鼓舞。在加纳独立之后不久，1957年4月17日，尼日利亚有着不同政治主张的三个地区的领袖发表了联合公报，一致要求在1959年独立，虽然这个要求遭到了英国殖民当局的无理拒绝，但尼日利亚人民的独立运动却更加发动起来。5月间，塞拉勒窝内的人民也发出了要在1960年独立的呼声，并把他们的领袖人物称为“塞拉勒窝内的恩克鲁玛”。
    殖民主义者对它们殖民利益的丧失是不甘心的，对殖民地人民获得独立后所取得的胜利更是敌视的。当加纳胜利地维护它的主权和建设他们的国家的时候，英国报纸对加纳的各种维护独立和主权的措施进行恶毒的攻击和诽谤，殖民主义者在加纳的代理人也同时进行颠覆和破坏活动，但是加纳政府并没有被这些所吓倒。1957年12月3日，加纳议会通过了一项紧急法案，授予政府处理骚乱或暴力行为的特别权力。一些进行破坏活动的分子已被加纳政府驱逐出境。
    在年轻的加纳面前，无疑地还会有不少困难。但是，民族独立的光芒已经照亮了非洲大陆，殖民主义的寿命已经屈指可数了。我们相信，在全世界和平和正义力量支持下，团结的加纳人民，一定能够战胜来自各方的困难，使他们的祖国日益富强繁荣起来。（附图片）
