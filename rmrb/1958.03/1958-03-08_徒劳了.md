Notes

    Futile

    After U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a statement refusing the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a foreign ministers' conference, some American journalists tried their best to seek written support for Dulles. United Press International issued a dispatch from London on the 5th, saying that Britain immediately followed the United States in rejecting the Soviet proposal. However, the "immediately following" of Britain did not happen.

    On the 5th, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said that Dulles was expressing the views of the U.S. government. On the 6th, when answering the question of whether there was a "slight difference" between the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister in their attitude towards a top-level meeting, the spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: "We agree with the U.S. President's positive attitude towards holding a 'top-level' meeting that is likely to produce results." It is not apparent that there is any intention of "immediately following" the United States in this attitude.

    It seems that the efforts of some American journalists have been in vain.

    徒劳了
    在美国国务卿杜勒斯发表拒绝苏联关于举行外长会议的谈话后，美国的一些记者们就竭力为杜勒斯寻求纸面的支持。合众社于5日从伦敦发出的电讯说，英国马上跟随着美国拒绝了苏联的建议。可是，英国“马上跟随”上来的事情并没有发生。
    5日，英国外交部的发言人说，杜勒斯表达的是美国政府的见解；6日，在答复美国总统与英国首相在对待最高级会议的态度是否“稍有区别”的问题时，英国外交部的发言人又说：“我们同意美国总统对于举行一次大概会产生结果的‘最高级’会议所持的积极态度。”人们看不出，在这种态度里有“马上跟上”美国的意思。
    看来，美国的一些记者们的努力是徒劳了。
