    Harbin Second Industrial Bureau Affiliated Large Factories
    Will Breed Fifty-Four Small Factories
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 28th dispatch) The large and old factories affiliated with the Harbin Second Industrial Bureau are using the "hen laying eggs" method to breed various small factories. This is a good method for developing local industry that requires little investment, is fast, and has significant economic benefits.
    Since the beginning of this year, this industrial bureau has used this method to establish fourteen small factories. The total investment for these factories is 100,000 yuan, and it is estimated that they will create over 10 million yuan in output value this year. They can also manufacture more than 100 new products, including chloroethane (a raw material for manufacturing plastics), corrugated cardboard boxes for product packaging, industrial cameras, chicken and pig feed, insecticides, and more.
    There are two ways to establish small factories. One is for an old or large factory to use its production potential to trial-produce new products. Other related factories provide surplus equipment and buildings to establish a small factory to produce this product. The other method is for several factories, under the planning of the industrial bureau, to pool their available buildings, equipment, personnel, and leftover and waste materials to establish small factories. For example, the feed factory's building utilizes an old warehouse from an old factory, and the main equipment is transferred from oil and starch factories. The raw materials for the feed are broken bones left over from the toothbrush factory and brewers' grains and barley awns from the brewery.
    Based on the experience of building these new factories, the Harbin Second Industrial Bureau has mobilized more than 100 factories under its jurisdiction to find ways to build another forty small factories this year.

    哈尔滨第二工业局所属大厂
    将繁殖小厂五十四个
    本报哈尔滨28日电　哈尔滨市第二工业局所属的大厂、老厂，采用“母鸡下蛋”的方法，繁殖各种小型工厂。这是一种花钱少、速度快、经济效果大的发展地方工业的好方法。
    今年以来，这个工业局运用这个方法，已经建立了十四个小型工厂。这些个厂的投资共十万元，预计今年内就可创造产值一千多万元，还可以制造出一百多种新产品，其中有制造塑料的原料氯乙烷，有包装产品需要的瓦笼纸箱和工业用照相机，还有鸡猪饲料、杀虫剂等。
    建立小型工厂有两种做法。一种是由一个老厂或大厂利用它的生产潜力试制新产品，由其他有关工厂提供剩余设备和房屋，建立小型工厂来生产这种产品。另一种方法是在工业局规划下，由几个工厂将可以拨出的房屋、设备、人员和余材废料集中起来，兴办小工厂。如饲料厂的厂房是利用老厂的旧仓库，主要设备是从油脂厂、淀粉厂调来的，饲料的原料是利用牙刷厂剩下来的碎骨和啤酒厂的酒糟、麦稗等。
    哈尔滨第二工业局根据建设这些新厂的经验，已经动员全局所属一百多个工厂找寻门路，在今年内再建四十个小型工厂。
