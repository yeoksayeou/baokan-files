    据新华社新义州16日电　中国人民志愿军首批归国部队的先头部队所乘坐的第一辆列车，在今天上午九时（朝鲜时间）到达新义州。当地的六万朝鲜市民到车站热烈欢送。
    当载着志愿军的列车进入新义州车站时，久候在月台上和车站广场上的朝鲜人民，发出了春雷般的“万岁”声。人们挥舞着朝中两国国旗和鲜花，拥向列车两旁。一队队的朝鲜人民和人民军官兵，攀登上车门，把鲜花献给志愿军官兵；然后又把志愿军官兵抬在肩上，进行了朝中友谊大游行。
    十点钟，新义州六万市民，在车站广场上举行了隆重的欢送大会。朝鲜平安北道人民委员会委员长宋昌帘致了欢送词。

    大会结束后，车站的月台和广场上，进行了歌舞大联欢。在临别的时候，朝鲜军民和志愿军官兵热烈拥抱、依依惜别。
    九点三十分，志愿军官兵向这座英雄的朝鲜城市告别，登车向鸭绿江桥进发。这时，欢送的人群，一直跟着列车奔跑到鸭绿江桥头，向着渐渐远去的列车上的志愿军战士，招手送别。
