    Archaeological Workers Must Go All Out
    Archaeological work lags far behind basic construction. We hope that everyone will go all out and abide by the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. Senior scientists should especially cultivate young people, and young scientists should accumulate more experience and knowledge, seize the time, and produce more good results to compete with the rapid progress of basic construction.

    Western Language Department Professors' Emphasis on the Ancient and Neglect of the Modern
    Many teachers in the Western Language Department have a serious tendency to emphasize the ancient and neglect the modern. This is reflected in teaching and scientific research. British and German literary history both end hastily in modern times. Very few elective courses cover modern literature. It is difficult for young teachers and graduate students to find guidance from older teachers if they want to learn about modern things. Mr. Yang Zhouhan once told me that he specialized in ancient English literature. Mr. Li Funing studies adjectives in Chaucer's works. Mr. Tian Dewang said that he planned to work on medieval German literature. Mr. Tian once said that he never read anything of modern China because ancient things were more worthy of savoring than modern ones; Mr. Tian has always been humble, but when he said this, he revealed a disdain for modern Chinese literature. I personally also believe that the Goethe era was the most glorious era of German literature, and the Tang Dynasty was the richest in Chinese literary history. The ideological root of these views is escaping reality and not caring about the current struggle. To reverse this bias, we must start by dispelling the lethargy.

    Research on New Tools Created by Peasants
    In the great leap forward of water conservancy construction in the countryside, the peasants have shown great ingenuity and created many tools, such as "earth-style surveying instruments" and "cable-type cranes." It is recommended that the Water Conservancy College send personnel to investigate and sort out these creations in conjunction with relevant departments and promote them for use in other places. In this way, it will technically support the great leap forward and also benefit the improvement of teaching materials and teachers.

    Eliminate "Great Peking University-ism"
    Some teachers at our Peking University have a strong "Great Peking University-ism" mentality. They often talk about how strong Peking University is, how superior it is, etc., in and out of class. We demand that teachers resolutely eliminate arrogance and humbly learn from other universities, because we still have many areas where we are not as good as others, and there is nothing to be proud of.

    考古工作者要鼓足干劲
    考古工作远远落后于基本建设，希望我们大家鼓足干劲，遵守多、快、好、省的方法，老科学家特别要多培养青年，青年科学家要多积累经验和学识，争取时间，多作些好的成绩出来，和基本建设的突飞猛进比赛。

    西语系教授的重古轻今
    西语系许多教师存在着严重的重古轻今思想。它反映在教学和科学研究上。英国文学史和德国文学史都是到了近代便草草收兵。选修课里关于现代文学部分的非常稀少。青年教师和研究生要想学点现代的东西，很难找到老教师的指导。杨周翰先生对我说过，他专攻的是英国古代文学。李赋宁先生研究乔叟作品中的形容词。田德望先生说过，他预备搞中古德国文学。田先生有一次还说，中国现代的东西他是从来不看的，因为古代的东西比现代的耐人吟味；田先生一向是谦虚的，但是说这句话时，流露对中国现代文学鄙视的神气。我个人也认为歌德时代是德国文学最辉煌的时代，中国文学史中唐代是最丰富的。这些看法追究其思想根源是逃避现实，不关心当前的斗争。要扭转这个偏向，还是要从打掉暮气作起。

    研究农民创造的新工具
    在农村兴修水利的大跃进中，农民们发挥了很大的钻劲，创造许多工具，如“土式测量仪器”、“缆式起重机”等等，建议水利学院抽调人力会同有关部门去调查整理这些创造，推广到其它地方使用。这样，既在技术上支援了跃进，又对教材和师资的提高有好处。

    打掉“大北大主义”
    我们北京大学有些老师“大北大主义”思想很浓厚，课上课下常常谈出：北大如何如何强，如何如何优越等等，我们要求老师们坚决打掉骄气，虚心向其他院校学习，因为我们还有许多地方不如人家，没有什么可以骄傲的。
