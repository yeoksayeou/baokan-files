    “Tianqiao” People in the Countryside
    The twenty-six staff members of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store who were transferred to work in the countryside are happily laboring at the state-owned Beijing Nankou Farm. They proposed to launch a socialist competition with their comrades who remained working in the department store, guaranteeing that they would not take a break during the planting season before April 10th, so as to turn the wasteland into orchards as soon as possible.
