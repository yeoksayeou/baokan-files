Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 17th: Despite the South African federal government authorities announcing on the 14th that they would submit a reactionary bill to parliament to outlaw all activities of the "African National Congress," a rally of African workers jointly initiated and hosted by this political organization and other organizations was held as scheduled in the suburbs of Johannesburg on the 16th. More than 5,000 African workers participated in this grand gathering. The flags of the "African National Congress" fluttered proudly around the open-air venue.

Although a group of special police officers with shorthand notebooks were watching menacingly in the venue, the speakers still fearlessly took the floor one after another, vehemently criticizing the government authorities' policy of racial segregation and demanding wage increases and allowing Africans to have a voice in the government.

Finally, the meeting passed a resolution putting forward the following demands: that the daily minimum wage be legally guaranteed to be no less than one pound, that all racial discrimination decrees be immediately abolished, that the rule of the Nationalist Party government be ended, and that Africans should have representatives in the government.

The resolution also called on all South African people, regardless of race or region, to hold a "National Protest and March Week" around the mid-April general election to support the demands put forward by the people.

The "African National Congress" is the largest and earliest political organization of the native people of South Africa. Founded in 1922, it has 100,000 members and its purpose is to fight for African unity, oppose racial discrimination, and strive for democratic rights. The South African government, which has always pursued a policy of racial discrimination, announced on the evening of March 14th, as the South African general election (scheduled for April 16th) drew closer, that it would ban this nationalist organization.

The "African National Congress" issued a statement on the 15th, accusing the Nationalist Party government of this ban as "an anti-democratic abuse of power."

    要求增加工资　反对种族歧视
    南非工人举行盛大集会
    据新华社17日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：尽管南非联邦政府当局14日宣布向议会提出取缔“非洲人国民大会”一切活动的反动法案，但是由这个政治组织及其他一些组织共同发起和主持的一次非洲工人集会16日在约翰内斯堡市郊仍然如期举行。五千多名非洲工人参加了这次盛大的集会。“非洲人国民大会”的旗帜在露天会场周围傲然地迎风飘扬。
    虽然手拿速记本的一批特种警察在会场中虎视眈眈地进行监视，但是演讲者仍然毫不畏惧地一个接一个发言猛烈抨击政府当局的种族隔离政策，并且要求增加工资和允许非洲人在政府中享有发言权。
    最后会议通过决议，提出了下列要求：以法律保证每日最低工资不得低于一镑，立即取消一切种族歧视的法令，结束国民党政府的统治，非洲人在政府中应该有代表。
    决议还要求全体南非人民，不分种族和地域，在4月中旬大选前后举行“全国抗议和游行周”以支持人民提出的要求。
    “非洲人国民大会”是南非土著人民最大和最早的政治组织，成立于1922年，拥有会员十万人，它的宗旨是为争取非洲人团结、反对种族歧视和争取民主权利而斗争。一向奉行种族歧视政策的南非政府在南非大选（定于4月16日举行）日益临近的时候，在3月14日晚间宣布查禁这个民族主义组织。
    “非洲人国民大会”在15日发表声明，指责国民党政府这个禁令是“反民主地滥用权利。”
