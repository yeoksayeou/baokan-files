Why?

    Why is a bulb with a reconnected filament so bright?
    The coiled filament inside a light bulb is made of tungsten. Tungsten wire can block the flow of electricity (resistance), so when electricity passes through it, the filament emits a large amount of heat, thus emitting light. This is why electric lights can illuminate. The longer the filament, the greater the resistance. When a broken filament is reconnected, the length of the filament through which the current passes is inevitably shortened, so the resistance decreases, the current becomes relatively stronger, and the power also increases. Therefore, the bulb becomes brighter, but it also consumes more electricity.
    The dazzling light of a bulb with a reconnected filament is often like a flash in the pan, and it goes out quickly. This is because every light bulb has a certain number of candlepower (wattage), such as the 25-watt and 40-watt bulbs we commonly use. The length of the tungsten wire and the materials used in these bulbs are designed in advance during manufacturing. After the filament breaks, the current suddenly increases, causing the temperature inside the bulb to rise a lot. Therefore, the filament cannot withstand such high temperatures and evaporates. Then the tungsten turns into gas and attaches to the bulb wall, so a thick layer of black smoke covers the inside of the bulb.

    重接灯丝的灯泡为何特别亮？
    灯泡里的弯弯曲曲的灯丝，是由金属钨作成的。钨丝能阻挡电流（电阻），因此当电流通过时，就在灯丝上发出大量热，以致发出光来。这就是电灯能够照明的原因。灯丝越长，电阻就越大。断了的灯丝重新接起时，通过电流的灯丝长度必然缩短，这样所产生的电阻也就变小了，电流就相对变强，电功率也高了，于是灯泡更加明亮，但也就更费电了。
    断丝重接的灯泡的耀眼光亮，往往如同昙花一现似的，很快就灭了。这是因为每一个灯泡都有一定的烛光数目（瓦数），像我们常用的是二十五瓦、四十瓦等。这些灯泡的钨丝长短和所用的材料，都是预先在制造时设计好的，断过丝后，电流突然增强，使灯泡内部温度升高很多，于是灯丝耐不住这样的高温，便蒸发了。于是钨变成气体，附在灯泡壁上，所以灯泡内部也蒙上一层很浓的黑烟。
