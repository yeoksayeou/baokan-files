Xinhua News Agency dispatches report: The news that an American plane dropped an atomic bomb over Florence, South Carolina, has caused serious unease in Britain, West Germany, Italy, and the United States.

This news occupied an important position in British newspapers on the 12th. It is believed that this will further develop the anti-hydrogen bomb movement and the movement demanding that Americans return home in Britain.

The "Star Evening News" said that although the bomb did not explode after the plane crash, radioactive hazards were entirely possible. The newspaper believes that if the plane burns, the deadly radioactive dust produced will not be easy to eliminate. The "Worker's Daily" reminded people that the incident of a plane carrying an atomic bomb crashing is a real threat to Britain. Even the pro-government "Daily Brief" said, "We strongly doubt whether such things should be allowed to happen unless it is a combat flight, and a combat flight is something we hope and pray will never happen."

Many British people who oppose nuclear weapons believe that this incident confirms their argument: a purely accidental event could lead to nuclear war or a human catastrophe.

Labour MPs Frederick Messer and Stephen Swingler, who advocate Britain taking the initiative in nuclear disarmament, believe that this incident illustrates how dangerous it is for American planes carrying hydrogen bombs to fly over Britain.

In debates held in the House of Lords and the House of Commons, members questioned the government about the American plane crash. Lord Templewood expressed concern that some irresponsible action might lead to a "terrible disaster." He said, "The current tension cannot be allowed to continue, and this situation should be ended by holding a summit meeting or some other means."

Many religious leaders, educators, and political figures throughout West Germany have pointed out that the Florence incident is a "typical example" of what can happen if the atomic arms race continues. Prominent West German pastor Michalski said that the Florence incident was "a crime against humanity." He emphasized that stopping the atomic arms race is now "extremely urgent." Social Democratic Party Federal Parliament member Menzel pointed out: "The Florence incident very clearly indicates the necessity of the struggle against atomic armament."

Italian radio, commenting on the Florence incident, pointed out that if American planes continue to fly carrying nuclear bombs, it will cause "a tragedy of unimaginable proportions." The commentary firmly opposed the American authorities' behavior of "treating death as a game." The commentary specifically pointed out that American planes carrying atomic bombs are also flying over Italy. The Italian people must strive to eliminate this threat from American planes. In order to safeguard the lives of residents, Italian social figures must strive to convene a summit meeting as soon as possible.

In the United States, South Carolina Democratic Congressman Rivers requested on the 12th that Congress investigate the dangers posed by planes carrying atomic bombs flying over densely populated areas.

Oregon Democratic Congressman Porter said that this incident illustrates how dangerous nuclear weapons are and makes the arguments about the threat of accidental atomic bomb explosions even more compelling.

Holifield, chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of both houses of Congress, demanded that the Department of Defense submit a report on the South Carolina incident to the committee.

Defense Secretary McElroy attempted to downplay the seriousness of the matter. He issued a statement on the 12th, insisting that this "unfortunate incident" did not produce "contamination due to the spread of any nuclear material." However, according to Hunter Air Force Base Commander Major General Charles Dow, "The entire area surrounding the explosion site will be sealed off for several days." At the same time, the Air Force has classified the bomb fragments as "secret items."

### 美机扔下核炸弹事件震动了本国和西欧  要求消除美国核武器灾祸的呼声四起

    美机扔下核炸弹事件震动了本国和西欧
    要求消除美国核武器灾祸的呼声四起
    本报综合报道据新华社讯：美国飞机在南卡罗来纳州弗洛伦斯上空扔下一颗原子核炸弹的消息在英国、西德、意大利和美国国内引起严重不安。
    这个消息在12日的英国报纸上占据了重要地位。人们认为，这将使英国的反氢弹和要求美国人回国的运动进一步发展。
    “明星晚报”说，虽然飞机失事后炸弹没有爆炸，但是，发生放射性危害完全是可能的。报纸认为，如果飞机燃烧的话，所产生的致命的放射性尘埃是不容易消除的。“工人日报”提醒人们，载有原子弹的飞机失事事件是对英国的真正威胁。甚至支持政府的“每日简报”也说，“我们非常怀疑，除非是战斗飞行，这种事情是否应该容许它发生，而战斗飞行是我们希望并且祈祷永远不会发生的。”
    许多反对核武器的英国人认为这次事件证实了他们的论据：一个纯然偶发的事件可能导致核战争或者是人类的大灾难。
    主张英国主动实行核裁军的工党议员弗雷德里克·麦塞和斯蒂芬·斯文格勒认为，这件事说明了载有氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行是多么危险。
    在上院和下院举行的辩论中，议员就美国飞机失事的问题向政府提出质询。上院议员滕普尔伍德表示担心某种不负责任的行动可能导致“可怕的灾难”。他说，“目前的紧张局面不能容许再继续下去了，应当用举行最高级会议或者某种其他办法来结束这种局面。”
    西德各地许多宗教界领袖、教育界人士和政界人士都指出，弗洛伦斯事件是个“典型例子”，说明继续进行原子军备竞赛会发生什么事情。西德著名牧师米夏尔斯基说，弗洛伦斯事件是“对人类犯罪”。他强调指出，制止原子军备现在是“极端迫切的事”。社会民主党联邦议院议员孟泽尔指出：“弗洛伦斯事件极其明显地指出了反对原子军备斗争的必要性。”
    意大利广播电台在评论弗洛伦斯事件时指出，美国飞机继续携带核弹飞行，就会引起“一次规模无法想像的大悲剧”。评论坚决反对美国当局这种“把死亡当作儿戏”的行为。评论特别指出：携带原子弹的美国飞机也在意大利上空飞行。意大利人民必须争取消除美国飞机的这种威胁。为了维护居民的生命安全，意大利社会人士必须争取尽快召开最高级会议。
    在美国国内，南卡罗来纳州民主党众议员李维斯12日要求国会调查载有原子弹的飞机在人口稠密地区上空飞行所带来的危险性。
    俄勒冈州民主党众议员波特尔说，这件事说明核武器有多么危险，并且使得关于原子弹偶然爆炸的威胁的论据更加充足了。
    国会两院原子能研究联席委员会主席霍利菲尔德要求国防部向这个委员会提出关于南卡罗来纳州事件的报告。
    国防部长麦克艾罗伊企图掩饰这件事的严重性。他在12日发表声明，硬说这次“不幸事件”并没有产生“由于任何核物质的散布而发生的污染现象”。但是据亨特尔空军基地长官查尔斯·道少将宣布，“围绕爆炸地点的整个地区将封锁若干天”。同时空军已经把炸弹碎片列为“秘密品”。
