Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 23rd: Farmers in Shaanxi Province are currently making a concerted effort to eliminate backward plots in wheat fields, vigorously working to improve the poor growth of third-category wheat fields through additional processing, watering, and fertilization.

Of the 23 million mu of wheat sown in Shaanxi Province last year during the drought, 80% are growing well. These wheat plants have deep roots, are robust in development, and have numerous tillers, with each mu having 200,000 to 400,000 wheat ears. However, approximately 20% of the wheat fields, sown late and with rough cultivation, have weak seedlings, many broken ridges, and missing plants, with only about 100,000 ears per mu. According to investigations by relevant departments, these types of wheat fields, based on their current growth, will yield about 100 jin less per mu than the well-growing fields. If the condition of these wheat fields is not fundamentally changed, Shaanxi Province will harvest 200 to 300 million jin less wheat this year.

To strengthen wheat field management and change the current situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture recently held a Guanzhong Wheat Field Management Conference in Wugong County. The conference criticized the erroneous thinking of being satisfied with the current general good growth of wheat and required all agricultural cooperatives to conduct a comprehensive inspection of wheat fields, categorize and rank them, and take intensive measures to upgrade each of the poorly growing third-category wheat plots, recover hundreds of millions of jin of grain, and strive for an overall bumper harvest.

Currently, counties in Guanzhong, the main wheat-producing area of Shaanxi, have taken emergency action. Agricultural cooperatives in Fuping County are shallowly irrigating, weeding, and fertilizing the third-category wheat fields. After the rain in Fuping County, topdressing fertilizer has been generally applied to the third-category wheat fields. In Douma Township, Xingping County, it is estimated that third-category wheat fields can only yield 200 jin per mu. After intensive management, fertilization, and weeding by the township's cooperatives, it is expected that the third-category wheat fields can be upgraded by one level, with a yield of about 340 jin per mu. Many agricultural cooperatives in Liquan and Weinan counties have upgraded many third-category wheat fields after strengthening management. For example, the third-category wheat fields of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County are now growing vigorously and lush green.

(Report from this newspaper) Xinhua Daily News: The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Funing County, Jiangsu Province, after a month of intense and concentrated efforts, has completely eliminated 114 mu of third-category wheat fields, cutting off low-yielding fields producing less than 350 jin.

In mid-February, the Shuguang Cooperative, composed of the cooperative director, production team leaders, and experienced veteran farmers, formed an inspection team of nearly twenty people. They conducted an in-depth inspection of wheat seedling growth in the fields of each team, ranked them plot by plot, and examined each plot in detail. As a result, it was found that among the 622 mu of wheat in the entire cooperative, 114 mu were third-category. If these were not given focused cultivation, they would only yield 75 jin per mu. After analysis, everyone believed that the soil quality of these third-category wheat fields was no worse than that of the good wheat fields, but simply because these fields were farther from the village, less manure was applied, and the soil lacked fertility, the wheat seedlings did not grow well. The cooperative's overall wheat yield target was 420 jin per mu. If cultivation was relaxed, the good and bad would average out, and the per-mu yield would only reach 393 jin. If the third-category wheat fields were cultivated and improved, yielding 350 jin per mu, then the cooperative's overall wheat yield could exceed the target by 37 jin. After this calculation, many cadres and the masses consciously criticized the thought of neglecting third-category wheat fields. After the meeting, the entire cooperative mobilized more than 260 laborers to intensively apply fertilizer. Another 150 male and female members carried water to irrigate the third-category wheat, watering each mu with eighty loads. The cooperative specially designated Deputy Director Jiang Youliang to lead eighteen households of members, specifically responsible for the field management of the third-category wheat fields. After intensive fertilization, these third-category wheat fields have turned from yellow to green and have begun to grow vigorously, catching up with the first-category wheat.

    陕西地区加工加水加肥突击消灭落后地块
    让三类麦田亩亩升级
    曙光社算细账后鼓足干劲加强田间管理
    据新华社西安23日电　陕西省农民正在突击消灭麦田中的落后地块，大力为生长不好的第三类麦田进行加工、加水和加肥工作。
    陕西省去年抗旱播种的二千三百万亩小麦，有80％生长良好，这些麦子根深，发育健壮，分蘖多，每亩麦穗有二十到四十万株；但是也有约20％播种迟和作业粗糙的麦田，麦苗瘦弱，断垅缺苗多，每亩只有十多万穗。据有关部门调查，这一类麦田按目前生长情况看，比生长好的麦田每亩要少收一百斤左右。这类麦田的情况如果不根本改变，那么陕西省今年就将少收二、三亿斤小麦。
    为了加强麦田管理，改变现状，陕西省农业厅最近在武功县专门举行了关中麦田管理会议，批判了满足于当前小麦生长一般良好的错误思想，要求各农业社对麦田进行全面检查，分类排队，采取突击措施，使生长不好的三类麦田块块升级，抢回亿斤粮，争取全面丰收。
    现在陕西主要麦产区关中各县都已紧急行动起来。富平县各农业社正在对三类麦田进行浅灌、锄草和施肥。富平全县得雨后已经较普遍地为三类麦田又上了追肥。兴平县豆马乡三类麦田估计每亩只能收二百斤，经过这个乡的各社加工管理突击施肥和锄草，预计三类麦田可以提升一级，每亩产量达到三百四十斤左右。醴泉、渭南两县许多农业社在加强管理后，许多三类麦田已经升级。例如醴泉县烽火农业社三类麦田，现在长得茁壮油绿。
    本报讯　新华日报消息：江苏省阜宁县曙光农业社经过一个月来的紧张突击战斗，已经全部歼灭一百一十四亩三类麦田，砍掉三百五十斤以下的低产田。
    2月中旬，曙光社由社长、各生产队长和有经验的老农组成一个将近二十人的检查组，深入各队田间检查麦苗生长情况，逐块排队，块块过堂检查。结果，发现全社六百二十二亩麦子中，有一百一十四亩三类麦，如果不重点加工培植，一亩只能收七十五斤。大家经过分析，认为这些三类麦田的土质并不比好麦麦田的土质差，只是由于这些麦田离庄子较远，垩的肥料少，肥力不足，麦苗才长得不好。全社三麦产量的指标是四百二十斤，如果放松培植，好坏一扯，每亩单产只达三百九十三斤；如果把三类麦田加工培植，每亩收到三百五十斤，那么，全社三麦单产就可超过指标三十七斤。这一算，不少干部和群众都自觉地批判了轻视三类麦田的思想。会后，全社就出动了二百六十多个劳力，突击追施肥料。又有一百五十个男女社员挑水浇三类麦，每亩浇水八十担。社内特地划出副社长江有亮领导十八户社员，专门负责三类麦田的田间管理。这些三类麦经过突击追肥以后，已经由黄转青，开始旺盛生长，赶上一类麦。
