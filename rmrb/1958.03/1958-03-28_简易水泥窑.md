    Simple Cement Kiln
    The Zhuge Township in Yanshi County, Henan Province, has successfully experimented with a simple method for manufacturing cement.

    The main equipment for producing cement in Zhuge Township is a vertical furnace. The shape of the vertical furnace is a square exterior with a circular interior. The furnace is twelve meters high, with an inner diameter of 1.3 meters. The upper part is smaller than the lower part. The lower part of the furnace is built to a height of one meter using four-inch thick solid bricks, with a thickness of eight Chinese inches. On opposite sides, ash doors are left open, with a wind duct eye on the other side of the ash door. The size of the opening is determined by the diameter of the blower's air outlet. The inner wall of the furnace, from the top of the ash door to the top of the charging door, is constructed with firebricks to a height of nine meters. A charging door, 1.5 meters high and 1 meter wide, is opened on one side of the upper part of the furnace. An iron plate is laid on the inner bottom of the charging door, and an iron cover is hung on the door. A ten-meter-high chimney is built with blue bricks at the top of the furnace. A lightning rod is installed at the top of the chimney. A blower is set up next to the furnace, with an adjusting plate added to the blower duct. The blower duct is extended into the reserved wind duct eye for use.

    Such a vertical furnace can produce four tons of cement per day.

    Raw materials for cement production: mix 50 kilograms of chalky soil (white lime or green stone powder can be used), 7.5 kilograms of anthracite coal, and 3 kilograms of red clay in proportion, stir evenly, add about 15 kilograms of water to make a mud paste, and make spherical bodies weighing four to five taels (dry weight), which are the prepared materials. After the prepared materials are dried in the sun, they are placed in the furnace and heated to produce semi-finished products. Then, take them out, add 1.5 kilograms of gypsum per 100 kilograms, grind into fine powder, and the finished product—cement—is obtained.

    简易水泥窑
    河南省偃师县诸葛乡试验成功一种制造水泥的简易方法。
    诸葛乡生产水泥的主要设备就是一座直立炉。直立炉的形状是内圆外方。炉高十二公尺，炉内直径一点三公尺，上半部较小于下半部。炉的下部用四寸头的坚砖砌高一公尺，厚八公寸，对侧各留出灰门一个，灰门的另一侧留风道眼一个，口径大小依据鼓风机吐风口的径度确定。炉内壁由出灰门顶至添料门顶一段，都用耐火砖砌成，高九公尺。炉的上部在一侧开添料门一个，高一点五公尺，宽一公尺。添料门内底铺上铁板，门上挂上一个铁盖。炉的顶端用青砖砌一个十公尺高的烟囱。烟囱顶端安装上避雷针一个。在炉旁另设鼓风机一台，并在鼓风筒上加调剂板一块。将鼓风筒伸入所留的风道眼内使用。
    一座这样的直立炉，每天可以生产水泥四吨。
    配制水泥的原料：白垩土（白石灰或青石粉都行）五十公斤，无烟煤七点五公斤，红粘土三公斤的比例混合，搅拌均匀后，加水十五公斤左右和成泥糊，制成四至五市两（干后的重量）重的球形体，即为成料。成料制成晒干后，置于炉内加热，炼成的半成品，然后取出，每百斤加一点五公斤石膏研成细粉，就是成品——水泥。
