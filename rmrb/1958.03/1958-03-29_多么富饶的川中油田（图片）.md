    How Fertile the Central Sichuan Oilfield
    From left to right: ① The petroleum that had been sleeping for millions of years gushed out, with a fierce momentum like a long snake, and soon filled the nearby paddy fields. ② The workers in the exploration area worked day and night, using ladles and buckets to scoop the precious crude oil into oil tanks. ③ Who cares how deep or shallow the oil pool is, jump in and scoop up the precious crude oil. ④ The oil is coming out, come and scoop it up!

    多么富饶的川中油田
    从左至右：①沉睡了千万年的石油喷出来了，气势凶猛，有如一条长蛇，不一会儿便灌满了附近的稻田。②探区的职工们夜以继日地用瓢、桶把宝贵的原油捞到油罐里去。③那管它油池深浅，跳下去，把宝贵的原油捞上来。④油出来了，快来捞吧！　王功济摄（四川石油工人报社稿）
