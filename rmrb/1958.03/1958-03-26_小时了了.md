    Smart When Young
    Wei Xuan

    When Kong Rong was ten years old, he used his family connection as an excuse to meet Li Yuanli, who was famous at the time. Li Yuanli and the guests present were very surprised by Kong Rong's intelligence. Only Chen Wei, the Taizhong Daifu, said coldly, "Smart when young, not necessarily good when older." Kong Rong was not convinced and immediately retorted, "Thinking of you when you were young, you must have been very smart." Chen Wei was left dumbfounded by Kong Rong.

    Although the story is short, the intelligence, cleverness, and eloquence of the ten-year-old Kong Rong are vividly depicted. How many parents secretly think: How wonderful it would be if their children could be so intelligent and clever!

    In fact, many children are creative, but parents who are not good at inspiring and educating children unintentionally extinguish the sparks of their children's intelligence and wit. Children's eyes are good at observing small problems. For example, a mother tells her child not to open their mouth too wide when speaking, as it is unsightly and impolite. Later, a guest came to the house. The child innocently stood in front of the guest, carefully observing the guest's posture when speaking. Then, the child began to comment: "You open your mouth too wide when you speak, it's unsightly… That's what my mom told me." After the guest left, the mother sternly scolded the child, "Why did you say that to the guest?" The child applied the "knowledge" they had acquired to daily life, which should be considered a commendable thing. However, the mother was not happy and scolded the child for being talkative.

    Parents' rude prohibitions often hurt children's creative spirit. Parents should be very welcoming of their children's insignificant creations. Being indifferent to children's enthusiastic creations is harmful. Six-year-old Xiao Jin held a mirror in the sunlight and reflected the sunlight onto the wall, stomping his feet happily and shouting, "Everyone, come and watch a movie! The movie is so good!" The mother, afraid of breaking the mirror, immediately snatched it away and said disappointedly, "What movie or not!" With one sentence, the children's ingenious creative spirit was banished to the cold palace.

    Intelligence and cleverness are fundamentally different from naughtiness. Some parents do not restrain their children. When a child rudely curses at people, they secretly rejoice, thinking that the child is strong and will not suffer losses. As a result, this encourages the child's unreasonable habits.

    Parents should use more praise with their children. Of course, inappropriate boasting often encourages children to develop in the wrong direction.

    A child's intelligence and cleverness are like fire. If used properly, it can do many useful things; if used improperly, it can cause a fire! The serious problem lies in skillful guidance.

    小时了了
    威宣
    孔融十岁时，借口亲戚关系会见了名盛一时的李元礼。当时李元礼和在场的宾客们都非常惊讶于孔融的聪明，惟独太中大夫陈韪冷冷地说：“小时了了，大未必佳。”孔融听了不服气，立刻回嘴说：“想君小时，必当了了。”陈韪被孔融弄得啼笑皆非。
    故事虽短，十岁孩子孔融聪明乖巧、机警善辩的神情，却跃然纸上。多少父母亲都暗暗忖度：如果自己的孩子也能这样聪颖机警，那该多好啊！
    其实，许多孩子是富于创造性的，而不善于启发和教育孩子的父母亲却无意中熄灭了孩子聪颖机警的火花。孩子们的眼睛善于观察细小的问题。例如，一位母亲对孩子说，说话时不要把嘴张得太大。这样很难看，也不礼貌。后来，有一位客人来到家里。孩子天真地站在客人的面前，细心观察客人说话的姿态。接着便评论起来了：“您说话嘴巴张得太大了，难看。……妈妈告诉我的。”客人走后，妈妈厉声责怪孩子：“你怎么对着客人说这话呢？”孩子把所掌握的“知识”应用到日常生活中去，应该认为是可喜的事。然而，妈妈却不高兴地责怪孩子多嘴了。
    父母亲的粗暴的禁止，往往把孩子们创造精神挫伤了。做父母的对孩子们微不足道的创造都应当十分欢迎。对孩子们热情的创造漠不关心，这是有害的。六岁的小进拿着一面镜子在太阳光下把阳光反射到墙上，并且高兴得直跺脚，高声喊道：“大家来看电影！电影真好看啊！”妈妈看了，就深怕把镜子打破了，立刻把它抢过来，扫兴地说：“什么电影不电影！”一句话，把孩子们机巧的创造精神打入了冷宫。
    聪明乖巧和调皮是有原则区别的。有些父母亲对自己的孩子不加约束。孩子无礼貌地骂人了，也暗暗自喜，认为这孩子刚强不会吃亏。结果，助长了孩子蛮不讲理的习性。
    父母亲对孩子应该多采用赞扬的方法。当然不恰当的夸耀，也往往会助长孩子们向坏的方向发展。
    孩子的聪明乖巧就像火一样，用得适当，可以做许多有益的事情；用得不适当，却会造成火灾！严重的问题在善于引导。
