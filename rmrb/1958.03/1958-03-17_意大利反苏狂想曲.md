The Italian Anti-Soviet Rhapsody
Lè Shān

A Frenzied Performance

Not long ago, a piece of wood with so-called "blood writing" was discovered in Villa Santina, a town in northern Italy. The content of the "blood writing" was: "I am an Alpine man from the Carnia region of Italy, imprisoned in Siberia for fifteen years. Save me!"

Villa Santina is a timber transshipment point. Timber shipped from the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union often stays in freight cars on the sidings of the Villa Santina station for a few days before being unloaded or transshipped.

The frenzied performance of the anti-Soviet rhapsody began.

Various Italian reactionary newspapers, echoing the American and British bourgeois press, made a big fuss about the so-called "Italian prisoners of war in Siberia" incident. The Italian reactionaries tried their best to use this incident to conduct the performance of the anti-Soviet rhapsody. The Vatican, cloaked in religious garb and serving the monopoly capitalists, "appealed" to the Soviet Union through its radio station to release "Italian prisoners of war imprisoned in Siberia." The Italian authorities also came forward. In its reply to Premier Bulganin on the question of a summit conference on January 18, the Italian government even demanded that the Soviet Union release "Italians believed to be still detained in Russia." The performance of the anti-Soviet rhapsody reached its climax.

A Hotel Betrays the Truth

In a hotel in Villa Santina, several hoodlum-like teenagers sat in a corner, whispering to each other. They had done something disgraceful, a big mess had been made, and now they were worried about what punishment they would receive. It turned out that two of them were rascals working near the station. One day, when they were walking home after work, they were bored, so they crossed the tracks and secretly climbed onto a freight car loaded with timber, carrying out a prank they had planned for a long time to play a joke on the people of Villa Santina, writing the so-called "blood letter" on a piece of wood with colored pens. They did not yet understand that this prank was exactly what the Italian reactionaries were looking for. The small rascals suited the big rascals’ wishes.

The two rascal teenagers' drinking buddies, on their behalf, told several reporters the whole story. The reporters personally found the perpetrators of the prank and verified the story. The truth came out, and the anti-Soviet rhapsody completely failed!

Epilogue and Behind the Scenes

The Italian reactionary newspapers and some newspapers in the United States, Britain and other countries, which had hyped the so-called "Italian prisoners of war in Siberia" incident, were silent after the truth came out, as if they had never reported it. However, since the perpetrators of the prank had already confessed voluntarily, the Italian authorities had to bite the bullet and perfunctorily deal with it. Therefore, the two newspapers "Il Gazzettino" and "Il Piccolo", controlled by the Christian Democratic Party, came forward to make a reluctant explanation of the so-called "Italian prisoners of war in Siberia" incident, trying to turn a major issue into a minor one and a minor issue into nothing, covering up this scandal.

However, the despicable conspiracy of the performers of the anti-Soviet rhapsody cannot be covered up. As early as the rascal teenagers confessed, the Italian Communist Party's newspaper "l'Unità" had pointed out that the timber with the so-called "blood letter" was shipped from the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which is no less than two thousand miles away from Siberia; the test results also proved that the so-called "blood letter" was not written in blood; all this shows the absurdity of the "Siberian prisoners of war." However, the Italian authorities turned a deaf ear and resolutely carried out the performance of the anti-Soviet rhapsody. Their ulterior motives are very obvious. With the election approaching, the Italian authorities, who have consistently followed the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war and acting perversely, have discovered some facts that make them unhappy: the Italian people warmly welcome the heart-stirring Soviet peace initiatives, and the Italian people are increasingly dissatisfied with the colonization of the Italian economy and the concentration of land and capital. In order to deceive voters, continue to usurp power, and to prevent the relaxation of the international situation, the Italian reactionaries spare no effort to use all means to create an anti-Soviet and anti-communist atmosphere. This is the secret behind the anti-Soviet rhapsody.

    意大利反苏狂想曲
    乐山
    狂热的演奏
    不久以前，在意大利北部微拉·桑丁那城发现了一块写着所谓“血书”的木材。“血书”的内容是：“我是意大利卡尔尼亚地方的阿尔卑斯山人，在西伯利亚被囚已经十五年了。救救我吧！”
    微拉·桑丁那是木材的转运地。从苏联鞑靼自治共和国运来的木材，往往要在微拉·桑丁那车站侧线的货车上停留几天，然后再下卸或转运。
    反苏狂想曲狂热的演奏开始了。
    形形色色的意大利反动报纸，在美、英资产阶级报刊的呼应下，大事渲染所谓“西伯利亚意大利战俘”事件。意大利反动势力竭力利用这个事件来进行反苏狂想曲的演奏。披着宗教外衣为垄断资本家服务的梵蒂冈教廷，通过它的广播电台，向苏联“呼吁”释放“被囚在西伯利亚的意大利战俘”。意大利当局也出面了。意政府在1月18日致布尔加宁总理答复有关最高级会议问题的复函中，竟要求苏联释放“据信仍被扣留在俄国的意大利人”。反苏狂想曲的演奏达到了高潮。
    酒店露真情
    在微拉·桑丁那的一个酒店里，几个阿飞式的少年坐在角落里，交头接耳地谈着什么。他们干了一件不可告人的事，乱子闹大了，现在正担心着会受什么处分。原来，在他们中间有两个人是在车站附近干活的无赖。有一天，他们工作完毕步行回家的时候，因为闷得发慌，就越过路轨，偷偷地爬上了堆积木材的货车，执行了他们筹划已久的、给微拉·桑丁那城的人们开个玩笑的恶作剧，用颜色笔在一块木材上写下了所谓“血书”。他们还不明白这种恶作剧正是意大利反动派所求之不得的。小无赖正投合了大无赖的心意。
    两个无赖少年的酒友，代表他们出面，把事情的经过源源本本地告诉了几位记者。记者们亲自找着了恶作剧的搬弄者，对证了一番，真相大白，反苏狂想曲彻底破产了！
    尾声及幕后
    曾经大肆渲染所谓“西伯利亚意大利战俘”事件的意大利反动报纸与美、英等国资产阶级的一些报刊，在真相大白以后默默无言，仿佛它们从来没有报道过这件事。但是，恶作剧的搬弄者既然已经自动坦白，意大利当局不得不硬着头皮敷衍一下。于是，天主教民主党所控制的两家报纸“威内托新闻报”和“小报”出面，对所谓“西伯利亚意大利战俘”事件作了一番勉为其难的交代，企图大事化小、小事化无，把这件丑事遮住。
    但是，反苏狂想曲的演奏者的卑鄙阴谋是掩盖不了的。因为早在无赖少年招认之前，意大利共产党机关报“团结报”就已指出：写着所谓“血书”的木材是从鞑靼自治共和国运来的，鞑靼自治共和国与西伯利亚相距不下两千哩；化验结果也证明所谓“血书”不是用血写的；这都说明“西伯利亚战俘”的荒诞无稽。但是，意大利当局却充耳不闻，坚决地要进行反苏狂想曲的演奏。他们的别有用心也就非常明显了。大选近了，一贯追随美国扩军备战、倒行逆施的意大利当局发现了一些使它不愉快的事实：意大利人民热烈欢迎扣人心弦的苏联和平倡议，意大利人民对意大利经济的殖民化以及土地、资本的集中化日益不满。为了欺骗选民、继续窃据政权，为了阻止国际局势的缓和，意大利反动势力不惜利用一切手段制造反苏、反共的空气。这就是反苏狂想曲的幕后秘密。
