Semi-Monthly Agricultural Situation

"Jingzhe" (March 6th) - "Vernal Equinox" (March 21st)

In most areas, it rained or snowed during these two weeks. The drought situation in most parts of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River has been initially alleviated. These areas that received rain mostly seized the favorable opportunity after the rain to intensively carry out land preparation to preserve moisture, and hoeing and topdressing of wheat.

Southern Inner Mongolia, northwestern Gansu, southern Qinghai, Tibet, Sichuan, Hainan Island, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and other regions have not had rain or very little rain during this period. Drought-resistant sowing and seedling protection remain the main agricultural tasks of agricultural cooperatives in these arid areas. Counties in the Suining Special District of Sichuan have already mobilized to draw water for irrigation, concentrating efforts to stop the rising spring drought.

After "Jingzhe," the climate in northern regions has begun to warm up. Spring sowing activities in this area have increased with the change of seasons.

Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other major spring wheat areas have begun to sow spring wheat. The quality of wheat sowing in these areas this year is generally better than last year. Sufficient soil moisture, ample fertilizer, and the use of improved varieties in most areas are some of the characteristics of this year's spring wheat sowing. Some counties in Heilongjiang use flat sowing methods to sow spring wheat. Some areas in Inner Mongolia also used a large number of seeders in wheat sowing.

Spring wheat sowing in some areas of the North China Plain has come to an end. After the sowing is completed, many agricultural cooperatives immediately turned to field inspections. *

In most areas of the Yangtze River basin, cold and rainy weather has repeatedly attacked during this period. Protecting increasingly mature crops such as wheat and rapeseed is an important task for agricultural cooperatives in these areas.

Some areas' wheat fields have been affected by pests. In the Fuyang Special District of Anhui, 30,000 mu of wheat fields were found to be infested with wheat spider mites. Rapeseed fields in some areas with heavy rainfall have already been waterlogged. In areas with this situation, agricultural cooperatives are carrying out pest control, ditch clearing, and drainage work in conjunction with frost prevention.

Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces, through agricultural production inspections, have stopped the practice of plowing and turning rapeseed to press green manure, which has reappeared in some areas this year. After breaking the old habit of沤青(沤青 is a traditional method of fertilizing fields with green manure by submerging plants in water and letting them decompose), the area of rapeseed with guaranteed harvest has increased in some rapeseed-producing areas. As a result, the three counties of Yingcheng, Anlu, and Yunmeng in Hubei have expanded the area of rapeseed with guaranteed harvest by more than 400,000 mu.

Some areas in the Yangtze River basin have begun to sow early rice; large-scale sowing will generally take place after the "Vernal Equinox." This year, these areas that are sowing earlier have generally paid attention to the management of seedling fields, especially frost prevention measures in seedling fields, which are generally strengthened compared to previous years. Some areas have also held training courses to cultivate good seedlings.

Some areas south of the Nanling Mountains have entered the busy season of rice transplanting. The five thousand-jin counties of Chaoyang and Chenghai in the Chaoshan Plain started transplanting seedlings half a month earlier on March 17th. 142,000 mu of rice seedlings have been transplanted in the Pearl River Delta three days before the "Vernal Equinox." This year, rice transplanting here is generally 25 days earlier than last year, and in individual counties, it is more than a month earlier.

    半月农情
    “惊蛰”（3月6日）——“春分”（3月21日）
    多数地区在这半个月里都下了雨或雪。黄河中、下游大部地区的旱情得到初步缓和。这些得雨地区，大都抓紧雨后有利时机，紧张进行整地保墒、锄麦追肥。
    内蒙古南部、甘肃西北部和青海、西藏、四川等省的南部以及海南岛、云贵高原等地区，在这个阶段里一直没有下雨或下雨很少。抗旱播种、抗旱保苗，仍是这些干旱地区农业社的主要农活。四川遂宁专区的各县已经动员起来车水灌溉，集中力量制止正在抬头的春旱现象。
   “惊蛰”以后，北方地区的气候已开始回暖。这个区域的春播活动随着节令的变化而增多。
    黑龙江、内蒙古等主要春麦区，已开始播种春麦。这些地区今年播麦质量一般比去年良好，底墒足、肥料多、大部采用优良品种，是今年播种春麦的几个特点。黑龙江有些县用平播的办法播种春麦。内蒙古一些地区在播麦中还使用了大量播种机。
    华北平原一些地区的春麦播种已告一段落。许多农业社在播种结束以后，紧接着转入田间检查。＊
    长江流域的大部地区，在这个阶段一再受到寒冷阴雨的侵袭，保护日渐成熟的小麦和油菜等作物，正是这些地区农业社的一项重要任务。
    有些地区的麦田已发生虫害。安徽阜阳专区发现三万亩麦田有麦蜘蛛为害。部分雨多地区的油菜田，已有渍水。有这种情况的地区，农业社正结合防冻进行了治虫、清沟排水等农活。
    江西、湖北等省，通过农业生产大检查，制止了一些地区今年又出现的耕翻油菜压绿肥的作法。一些油菜产区在打破沤青老习惯以后，油菜保收面增加了。湖北应城、安陆、云梦三县，因此扩大油菜保收面积四十多万亩。
    长江流域的一些地区已开始播种早稻，大规模下种一般要在“春分”以后。这些提早播种的地区，今年普遍重视了秧田的管理工作，特别是秧田防冻措施，一般都比往年加强。有些地区还为育好秧苗举办了训练班。
    五岭以南一些地区已进入插秧大忙。潮汕平原的潮阳、澄海等五个千斤县，提前半个月在3月17日开始插秧。珠江三角洲在“春分”前三天已插下秧苗十四万二千多亩。今年这里插秧普遍比去年提早二十五天，个别县提早一个月以上。
