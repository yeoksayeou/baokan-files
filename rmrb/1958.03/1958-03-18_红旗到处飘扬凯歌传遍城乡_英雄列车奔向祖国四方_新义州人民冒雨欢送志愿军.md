Xinhua News Agency, Andong, March 17th. The first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops has arrived in Andong in several trainloads from the morning of the 16th to this evening. The trains carrying the returning heroes, after a short stop at Andong Station, have all left Andong Station one after another, heading to the interior of the Motherland.

When the trains arrived in Andong, they were warmly welcomed by the people of Andong, who had been waiting day and night on the platform. For the past two days, sounds of firecrackers, gongs, drums, and cheers have been constantly heard from Andong Station, and the magnificent "Volunteer Army War Song" has been continuously broadcasted by loudspeakers.

Xinhua News Agency, Sinuiju, March 17th. Thousands of people in the North Korean border city of Sinuiju braved the spring rain today to warmly welcome the first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops passing through here.

When the trains carrying the returning Volunteer Army troops arrived, the crowds who had been waiting at the station cheered "Long live!" and surged towards both sides of the trains. Many workers, students, women, and officers and soldiers of the People's Army presented flowers, gifts, and letters of gratitude to the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers. They also lifted up the Volunteer Army soldiers, wearing big red flowers and "Sino-Korean Friendship Medals," and paraded them around the train.

Then, people formed circles on the platform, and the Korean people and Volunteer Army officers and soldiers held hands, singing and dancing the Korean folk dance "Ongheya" and the Chinese Yangko dance. Many elderly Koreans and women carrying babies also sang and danced in the dance circles. When the train started, the well-wishers and Volunteer Army officers and soldiers held onto colorful paper streamers, waving goodbye to each other with reluctance.

    红旗到处飘扬凯歌传遍城乡
    英雄列车奔向祖国四方
    新义州人民冒雨欢送志愿军
    新华社安东17日电　中国人民志愿军首批归国部队，从16日上午到今天晚上，已有数次列车到达安东。载着归国英雄的列车在安东车站短时间停留以后，都已经先后离开安东车站前往祖国内地。
    当列车到达安东时，都受到了不分昼夜等候在站台上的安东人民的热烈欢迎。两天来，从安东车站上，不时传出鞭炮声、锣鼓声和欢呼声，扩音器不断地播送着雄壮的“志愿军战歌”声。
    新华社新义州17日电　朝鲜国境城市新义州人民数千人，今天冒着春雨，热烈欢送陆续经过这里的中国人民志愿军首批归国部队。
    当载着志愿军归国部队的一列列火车驶来的时候，久候在车站上的群众欢呼着“万岁”涌向了列车两旁。许多工人、学生、妇女和人民军官兵，纷纷向志愿军官兵献花、献礼、献感谢信。他们还把佩戴着大红花和“中朝友谊纪念章”的志愿军战士抬起来，绕着列车游行。
    接着，人们在月台上围成了一个个圆圈，朝鲜人民和志愿军官兵们手拉着手，边唱边跳着朝鲜的“翁嘿呀”民间舞和中国的秧歌舞。许多朝鲜老人和背着婴儿的妇女，也在舞圈中唱着舞着。当列车开动的时候，欢送的人们和志愿军官兵们拉着一根根彩色纸条，恋恋不舍地互相挥手告别。
