The Great Leap Forward's Situation Requires Strong Organizational and Propaganda Work
Branch Work Must Catch Up and Take the Lead!
Fengtai Station Branch Explores Five Areas of Competition and Evaluation

(Reported by this newspaper) Beijing Fengtai Station's twelve branches, using the method of carrying out branch work evaluation and competition, promoted the leap forward in branch work and the leap forward in党员thought, quickly bringing a new atmosphere to branch work.

In February of this year, the Fengtai Station Party Committee inspected the situation of the "Double-Anti" movement and found that the criticism and exposure were not deep or thorough, the criticism of conservative thought was weak, and the various waste phenomena and problems in the rules and regulations were not thoroughly exposed. After analysis, the Party Committee believed that the main reason for the slow progress of the movement was that the branch leadership could not keep up, lacking strong organizational and propaganda work for the movement. Among the twelve branches, six branches lacked effective leadership for the movement. In this situation, the Party Committee decided to carry out branch work evaluation and competition.

First, the Party Committee adopted the leadership method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle. The Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Station Party Committee were assigned to go deep into the Transportation Second Branch, which was performing well, and the Freight Yard Third Branch, which was relatively backward, to help them improve the system of collective leadership with division of responsibilities for the Branch Committee, summarize advanced experience. After achieving initial results, the Party Committee conducted the first evaluation of the work of each branch. The announcement of the evaluation results caused a great shock. Most branches held enlarged meetings of the Branch Committee or党员meetings overnight to review their work, take measures to improve branch work, clearly stipulate the leadership system of the branch, and make specific arrangements for the work of each党员. On this basis, the Station Party Committee mobilized the branches to discuss and formulate higher and more comprehensive evaluation conditions. Each branch put forward a leap forward plan for branch work and letters of challenge and response. Some党员also formulated personal guarantee conditions. The second evaluation meeting was held from March 10th to 12th.

After more than a month, branch work had been significantly improved. The original six backward branches had made varying degrees of progress in the first evaluation, and two of them had caught up with the better branches. By the time of the second evaluation, even the most backward Freight Yard Fourth Shift branch had made significant achievements in leading the Double-Anti movement and achieving production leap forward targets. All branches have established a system of collective discussion and fully utilizing the individual roles of Branch Committee members, achieving timely detection of problems and immediate convening of on-site meetings to exchange experiences and study solutions. All non-detached branch secretaries and branch committee members actively engaged in activities, dividing up and managing a certain aspect of the Party's work, or contracting a group as a personal "experimental field," mobilizing all党员to take the lead in solving key production problems, conducting ideological and political work universally and deeply, making friends with the masses, helping backward masses, and adopting methods such as home visits, individual talks, and specific assistance to inspire their enthusiasm. As soon as they saw some changes in them, they immediately praised them. The Rotation Fourth Shift branch, with nineteen党员, made a total of thirty-eight friends among the masses. With the help of the党员, twelve of the eighteen relatively backward masses in the whole shift have become active, which has effectively driven the middle masses and greatly promoted the Double-Anti movement and the great leap forward in production, and production targets have been continuously broken.

At the beginning of the Fengtai Station branch work evaluation and competition, the evaluation conditions were put forward by the Station Party Committee based on the existing problems in the branch work at that time, with only three items: comparing propaganda, comparing the realization of production leap forward plans, and comparing the new atmosphere. After an evaluation and discussion and deliberation by the branches, everyone felt that the original evaluation conditions were not enough, so the Station Party Committee changed its past practices and adopted a method combining top-down and bottom-up, and formulated more comprehensive evaluation and competition conditions than in the past: (1) Good ideological and political work: timely grasp the ideological situation inside and outside the Party, conduct ideological education work deeply and thoroughly; timely publicize the Party's various policies; do a good job in publicizing and mobilizing for the realization of the leap forward plan; (2) The Double-Anti movement is carried out well and production work is completed well: fully mobilize the masses, carry out the anti-waste and anti-conservative movement, expose more problems and burn them thoroughly; reform quickly and well; formulate advanced production plans and realize production leap forward plans; ensure comprehensive cooperation and safe production; (3) Good internal Party unity and good collective leadership and organizational role of the Party: the Branch Committee decides on major issues, the committee members divide up and implement them, and there are arrangements, assistance, and inspections for the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League; give full play to the role of various departments; (4) Good党员exemplary role and good Party-masses relations:党员have high awareness and sufficient enthusiasm, learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced, formulate advanced production targets and realize leap forward plans;党员do ideological work, maintain close ties with the masses, make friends with several non-Party members, and work actively in the trade union and the Communist Youth League; (5) Good working methods: the style of branch cadres has undergone great changes, work follows the mass line, grasps both ends and brings along the middle, and goes deep into the shifts and groups to do a good job in the "experimental field".

In order to achieve the evaluation conditions and become a five-good branch, each branch has formulated a leap forward plan for branch work, and mobilized党员to formulate personal leap forward plans. (Attached picture)

The Third Workshop of Tianjin Yu Fu Rubber Factory could not complete the daily output plan in the first eight days of March.党员Li Ziyu took the lead in proposing "bitterly fighting to the end of the month to change the backwardness of production."

    大跃进的形势需要有力的组织工作和宣传工作
    支部工作要赶上去，要走在前面！
    丰台车站支部摸索出竞赛评比的五个内容
    本报讯　北京丰台车站十二个支部，用开展支部工作评比竞赛的办法，促进支部工作的跃进和党员思想的跃进，很快使支部工作出现了新气象。
    今年2月份，丰台车站党委检查“双反”运动的情况，发现鸣放不深不透，对保守思想批判的不力，各种浪费现象和规章制度中的问题没有彻底揭发出来。经过分析，党委认为，运动开展迟缓的主要原因是支部领导跟不上去，对运动缺乏有力的组织工作和宣传工作，在十二个支部中就有六个支部对运动领导无力。在这种情况下，党委决定开展支部工作评比竞赛。
    首先，党委采取了抓两头、带中间的领导方法，由车站党委正副书记分工负责深入工作较好的运输二支部和比较落后的货场三支部，帮助他们健全了支委会集体领导分工负责的制度，总结了先进经验，取得初步成绩后，党委对各支部的工作进行了第一次评比。评比结果公布以后，震动很大。多数支部连夜召开支委扩大会议或者党员大会，检查工作，采取措施，改进支部工作；明确规定了支部的领导制度，对每个党员的工作都进行具体安排。在这基础上，车站党委发动各支部讨论，制定出更高、更全面的评比条件，各个支部提出了支部工作的跃进计划和挑战、应战书；有的党员也制定出了个人的保证条件。3月10日到12日又召开了第二次评比会议。
    经过一个多月的时间，支部工作有了显著改进。原有的六个工作落后的支部，在第一次评比时，就有了不同程度的进步，其中有两个支部已经赶上了较好的支部；到第二次评比时，连最落后的货场四班支部在领导双反运动和实现生产跃进指标方面也都取得了显著成绩。各支部都建立了集体讨论和充分发挥支委个人作用的制度，做到了随时发现问题，立即召开现场会议交流经验、研究解决问题；所有不脱产的支部书记和支委都积极活动起来，分工管理党的某一方面的工作，或包一个小组作为个人的“试验田”，发动起全体党员带头解决生产上的关键问题，普遍深入地做思想政治工作，同群众交朋友，帮助落后的群众，采用家庭访问、个别谈话、具体帮助的办法，鼓起他们的干劲，见到他们有一些转变，马上表扬。运转四班支部，十九个党员，共交了三十八个群众做朋友，经过党员的帮助，全班十八个较为落后的群众已有十二人积极起来，这样就有力地带动了中间群众，大大地推动了双反运动和生产的大跃进，生产指标连续被突破。
    丰台车站支部工作的评比竞赛，开始时，评比条件是由车站党委根据当时支部工作存在的问题提出来的，只有比宣传、比实现生产跃进计划、比新气象三条。经过一次评比和各支部的讨论酝酿，大家都感到原来的评比条件不够了，车站党委就改变了过去的作法，采取了自上而下和自下而上相结合的方法，订出了较过去更加全面的评比竞赛条件：（1）思想政治工作好：及时掌握党内外思想状况，思想教育工作做得深、做得透；及时宣传党的各项政策；作好实现跃进计划的宣传鼓动工作；（2）双反运动搞得好、生产工作完成好：充分发动群众，开展反浪费反保守运动，问题揭得多、烧得透；改得快、改得好；订出先进的生产计划，实现生产跃进计划；保证全面协作，安全生产；（3）党内团结好，党的集体领导和组织作用好：重大问题支委会决定，委员分工执行，对工会和团的工作有布置、有帮助、有检查；发挥各部门的作用；（4）党员模范作用好，党群关系搞得好：党员觉悟高、干劲足，学先进、赶先进，订出先进的生产指标，实现跃进计划；党员都作思想工作，密切联系群众，交几个非党群众做朋友，在工会、共青团中积极工作；（5）工作方法好：支部干部作风大转变，工作走群众路线，抓两头、带中间，深入班、组搞好“试验田”。
    各支部为了实现评比条件，成为五好支部，都订了支部工作的跃进规划，并且发动党员订个人跃进规划。（附图片）
