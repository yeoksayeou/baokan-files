    "Compromise Seedling Method"
    The "Compromise Seedling Method" is called "Ganman Yang" in Anhui; "Hui Yang" in Jiangsu; and "Banhan Yang" in Zhejiang. The improved water paddy field seedling cultivation in Sichuan is also similar. It is a seedling method between dry seedling and water seedling. A major feature of this method is: before the seedlings grow to about one and a half inches tall, the cultivation techniques are similar to dry seedling cultivation; after the seedlings grow to about one and a half inches tall, the paddy field management and seedling pulling techniques are the same as water seedling cultivation.
    Because the "Compromise Seedling Method" adds coverage after sowing, it can prevent frost and keep warm, prevent rain and retain water, and prevent bird damage. These are very beneficial for early-sown seeds at lower temperatures. After sowing, the seedling beds are not submerged in water. On the one hand, the field surface has sufficient oxygen, the young roots of the seeds grow quickly, and the buds are strong, which increases cold resistance; on the other hand, because there is no water on the seedling beds, it fundamentally avoids the problems that often occur in water seedling cultivation, such as moss, cotton rot, floating seedlings, and red threadworm damage, which are unfavorable to seedling cultivation.

    “折衷育苗法”
    “折衷育苗法”安徽叫干墁秧；江苏叫灰秧；浙江叫半旱秧。四川的改良水秧田育秧，也相近似，它是介于旱育秧和水育秧之间的一种育秧法。这个办法的一大特点是：秧苗生长高到一寸半左右以前，耕作技术与育旱秧近似；当秧苗生长高到一寸半左右以后，秧田管理和拔秧等技术，就和水育秧一样了。
    “折衷育苗法”由于播种后加了复盖，因此可以防冻保温，防雨保水，防止鸟害，这些对于处在较低温度下的早播种子是很有利的。在播种以后，秧板上不浸水，一方面，田面氧气充足，种子幼根长得快，芽子粗壮，增加了抗寒能力；另一方面，因为秧板上没有水，从根本上避免了水育秧时所常发生的青苔、绵腐病、飘秧以及红线虫为害等不利于育秧的一些毛病。
