Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Washington Dispatch: An article published in the "Washington Post" on the 25th stated that the latest Gallup poll shows that the fear of unemployment is constantly growing in the United States. For the first time since the economic crisis around 1930, unemployment has become the most concerning issue in the country today.

The newspaper said that the Gallup poll recently asked many adults a question: What do you think is the most important problem facing the United States today? Among the Americans who answered this question, 87% said: unemployment, and less than 1% answered so-called "national defense."

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Washington Dispatch: The U.S. Department of Commerce released a survey report on the 25th stating that business activity in the United States continued to decline in January and February.

The survey report stated that industrial production declined throughout February, dropping by about one-tenth since the summer of 1957. The largest decline was in the production of durable goods, with metal and metal-using industries declining particularly sharply. The durable goods industry includes steel, non-ferrous metals, metal components, machinery, automobiles, and other transportation equipment industries, etc. In February and early March, the operating rate of the U.S. steel industry was only 55%. The reduction in steel production reflects a decrease in consumption and also reflects users shifting from accumulating inventory to clearing inventory.

The report pointed out that the number of employed people in the United States is also declining. Compared with the levels in August and September of last year, non-agricultural employment in January and February of this year decreased by 2.5%; factory employment decreased by 6%; factory weekly working hours decreased by 3.5%; total wages and salary expenditures decreased by 2.5%; personal income decreased by 1.3%; however, the consumer price index rose by 1.2%.

At the same time, manufacturers' new orders decreased by 10%; retail sales decreased by 3%; and plant and equipment expenditures decreased by 10.1%.

    失业恐惧病蔓延美国
    工业生产续降　就业人数减少
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”25日刊载一篇文章说，最新的盖洛普民意测验说明，美国国内失业恐惧正在不断增长。自从1930年前后经济大危机时期以来，失业问题今天第一次成为全国最关心的问题。
    这家报纸说，盖洛普民意测验所最近向许多成年人提出一个问题：你认为什么是美国今天面临的最重要的问题？在回答这个问题的美国人中，87％说：失业，只有不到1％的人回答是所谓“国防”。
    据新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部25日发表一个调查报告说，美国1、2月份的企业活动继续下降。
    这个调查报告说，工业生产在2月全月一直下降，自从1957年夏季以来，共下降了十分之一左右。下降最多的是耐用品的生产，金属和使用金属的工业下降得特别厉害。耐用品工业包括钢铁、有色金属、金属构件、机器、汽车以及其他运输设备工业等等。在2月份和3月初，美国钢铁工业开工率只有55％，钢铁产量的降低反映了消费减少，同时也反映了用户从积累存货转变为清除存货。
    报告指出，美国的就业人数也在下降。同去年8、9月的水平比较，今年1、2月的非农业就业人数减少2.5％；工厂就业人数减少6％；工厂每周工作时间减少3.5％；全部工资和薪金支出减少2.5％；个人收入减少1.3％；然而消费品价格指数却上升了1.2％。
    同时制造商的新订货减少10％；零售额减少3％；厂房和设备开支减少10.1％。
