Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th -- According to TASS, Moscow, March 18th: French colonialists have established Hitler-style concentration camps—new "Buchenwalds"—in Algeria to brutalize Algerian patriots.

The "Komsomolskaya Pravda," which reported this news, said that the French authorities are preparing to throw the Algerian female patriot Djamila Bouhired, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, into one of these concentration camps.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" published a letter from an Algerian, which described the gloomy situation and appalling atrocities in such concentration camps. He escaped from the Boli Kazari concentration camp in southern Algeria.

He said: The concentration camp is located in a bitterly cold and desolate place, surrounded by two barbed wire fences and an electric fence. Further away are watchtowers about ten meters high. Each watchtower has patrols with machine guns. Bright searchlights illuminate the concentration camp all night long, and armored vehicles patrol along the barbed wire fence.

Algerian patriots imprisoned in this concentration camp, young and old, must dig the ground or carry stones all day long under the scorching sun. Even tuberculosis patients are no exception; they are all on the verge of death.

After eight o'clock in the evening, the concentration camp authorities release the police dogs. The nights are bitterly cold, and the tents are dilapidated. At the same time, everyone is also attacked by rats, scorpions, snakes, fleas, and lice.

The letter writer also described the atrocities of the guards. Hitting people with rifle butts and kicking them are commonplace in the concentration camp. Imprisoned people are also subjected to the punishment of "live burial": burying people vertically in sand pits, with only their heads exposed, for forty-eight consecutive hours. All those who are subjected to this punishment are tortured to death.

### 法殖民者继承希特勒衣钵  阿尔及利亚集中营成为活地狱

    法殖民者继承希特勒衣钵
    阿尔及利亚集中营成为活地狱
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚建立了一些希特勒式集中营——新的“布痕瓦尔德”，来摧残阿尔及利亚爱国者。
    报道这一消息的“共青团真理报”说，法国当局准备把被判处终身劳役的阿尔及利亚女爱国者加米拉·布伊海德投进一个这样的集中营里。
    “共青团真理报”发表了一个阿尔及利亚人的来信，这封信叙述了这种集中营里阴森森的情境和骇人听闻的暴行。他是从阿尔及利亚南部的波里卡泽里集中营逃出来的。
    他说：这个集中营设在一个严寒和荒凉的地方，四周有两道带刺的铁丝网和一道电网，再远一点是林立的高约十米的了望塔。每个了望塔里都有带着机关枪的巡逻队。耀眼的探照灯光整夜照射着集中营，装甲车沿着带刺的铁丝网巡视。
    被关在这个集中营的阿尔及利亚爱国者，不论青年和老人，都必须整天在暴日下挖地或搬运石头。结核病患者也不能例外，他们都濒于死亡。
    到晚上八点以后，集中营管理当局就把警犬放出来。夜间酷寒，而帐篷却是破烂不堪的。同时，每个人还受到老鼠、蝎子、蛇、跳蚤和虱子的袭击。
    写信的人还描写了监视官的暴行。用枪托打人和用脚踢人是集中营里司空见惯的事。被监禁的人还会遭到“活埋”的刑罚：把人竖埋在沙坑里，只有头部露在外面，就这样连续过四十八小时。受到这种惩罚的人统统被折磨死了。
