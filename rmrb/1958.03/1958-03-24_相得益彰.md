    Complementing Each Other
    Lin Bi
    Many art troupes are drawing up leap-forward plans to go deep into factories and rural areas and bring literature and art to the doorstep. This practice has been warmly welcomed by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, our country is a country with a population of 600 million and a vast territory, and the existing artistic performance groups are far from meeting the cultural and entertainment needs of the masses. Therefore, how to further develop mass amateur cultural activities is an urgent problem that needs to be solved.
    In the national and local amateur art festivals held several times in the past few years, we have clearly seen that many workers and peasants are not only advanced workers in production, but also masters of cultural and artistic activities. They love and are familiar with traditional art, and also use various folk forms to cooperate with the political movements and central tasks of various periods for propaganda and mobilization. In the past few years, professional art troupes have learned a lot from these festivals. After processing and sorting, some have become excellent artistic works that enjoy high praise at home and abroad. This fact shows that the amateur creations of the masses can only be improved with the help of professional troupes; and professional literary and art workers must constantly draw nourishment from amateur cultural and artistic activities to enrich themselves.
    Therefore, guiding mass cultural activities does not simply mean that professional art troupes are helping amateur art troupes. The development of this work has an important impact on the development of our entire cultural and artistic undertaking. Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan and other places have planned to organize professional groups to guide mass amateur cultural activities, which is a very good start. We believe that through frequent guidance activities in the future, the two will complement each other, and the amateur cultural activities of the masses will surely develop vigorously; the level of professional art troupes will also be improved. This strong literary and artistic contingent composed of professional and amateur literary and art workers will more effectively complete the party's propaganda and education tasks.

    相得益彰

    许多艺术团体正订出跃进规划，深入工农，把文艺送上门去。这种做法受到了工农群众的热烈欢迎。但是，我国是一个有着六亿人口和地域广阔的国家，现有的艺术表演团体还远远地不能满足群众的文化娱乐要求。因此，如何进一步开展群众业余文艺活动，是一个迫切需要解决的问题。
    几年来，在全国和各地多次举办的业余文艺会演中，我们清楚地看到，许多工农群众不但是生产上的先进工作者，同时也是文艺活动的能手，他们热爱并且熟悉传统艺术，还运用了多种民间形式配合各个时期的政治运动和中心工作进行宣传鼓动。几年来，专业的艺术团体从这些会演中学到了不少东西，经过加工整理以后，有的并成了国内外享有很高评价的优秀艺术作品。这个事实说明了群众的业余创作，只有在专业团体的帮助下，才能够得到提高；而专业文艺工作者也必须经常不断地从业余的文艺活动中吸取营养丰富自己。
    因此，辅导群众文艺活动，意义就不单纯是专业艺术团体帮助业余艺术团体而已，这个工作的开展，对发展我们整个文化艺术事业有重要的影响。上海、北京、天津、武汉等地有计划地组织专业团体辅导群众业余文艺活动，这是很好的开始。我们相信，通过今后经常的辅导活动，两者相得益彰，群众的业余文艺活动必将得到蓬勃的发展；专业艺术团体的水平也会有所提高。这一支由专业和业余文艺工作者组成的强大的文艺队伍，将更有力地完成党的宣传教育任务。
