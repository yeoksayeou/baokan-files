    "Better Safe Than Sorry"
    The state-owned No. 2 Rubber Factory has two health stations. One is located inside the factory, providing medical care for employees; the other is in the dormitory area, mainly providing medical care for family members.

    The two health stations have a total of six doctors, twenty-seven beds, one ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machine, one "radiant heat" device, one inductor, and one universal operating table. However, it is understood that the electrotherapy machine has been left unused for a long time because the person who knew how to operate it was transferred; the bed utilization rate in 1957 was 22% to 43%.

    Some people say that such health stations can be considered "better safe than sorry." This is indeed true. It's just that the "sorry" here is not the "preventative" "sorry," but the "no patients" "sorry."

    “有备无患”
    国营橡胶二厂有保健站二处。一处在厂内，给职工看病；另一处在宿舍，主要给家属们看病。
    两个保健站共有医生六人，病床二十七张，超短波电疗器、“发射热”和感应器各一架，万能手术台一架。但是，据了解：电疗器因为会操作的人调走了，长期无人使用；1957年的病床利用率是22％到43％。
    有人说，这样的保健站算是做到“有备无患”了。这话的确言之有理。只不过这个“患”字，不是“防患于未然”的“患”，而是“没有患者”的“患”字罢了。
