Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, March 25th: The Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province, which is actively raising funds to build local industry, already has more than 300 factories completed and put into production. Among these newly operational small-scale factories and mines, over 160 are producing iron, phosphorus, agricultural tools, and granular fertilizer. The newly built Jiuzhou Gypsum Factory in Huangping County has already supplied a large batch of gypsum recently produced to farmers of all ethnic groups, enabling the transformation of over 40,000 mu of cold paddy fields and muddy fields. The Leishan County Gunpowder Factory, which went into production at the end of February, has already supplied the first batch of more than 250 jin of gunpowder to farmers in Longli, Huangli, and other townships, resolving their difficulty in lacking gunpowder for water conservancy construction. Shibing County, which previously transported pig iron from other places every year to process agricultural tools, has promptly resolved the current need for iron in making and repairing agricultural tools after building its own iron factory.

In the past, the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture had very backward industrial production. This year, the prefecture plans to build more than 700 new small-scale factories and mines. This region is rich in underground resources, and many types of mineral deposits such as iron, coal, phosphorus, and petroleum have been discovered in recent years. The proven iron ore, once developed, can basically meet the current needs of industrial and agricultural production in the entire prefecture.

    黔东南苗族侗族自治州繁荣的先声
    新华社贵阳25日电　正在积极筹集资金建设地方工业的贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州，目前已有三百多个工厂建成投入生产。这批新投入生产的小型厂矿，有一百六十多个是生产铁、磷、农具和颗粒肥料的。新建的黄平县旧州石膏厂，已把最近生产的大批石膏供应给各族农民改造了四万多亩冷水田和烂泥田。2月底投入生产的雷山县火药厂，已把第一批生产的二百五十多斤火药，供应给龙里、黄里等乡的农民，解决了他们在兴修水利中缺乏火药的困难。原来年年从外地运进毛铁加工农具的施秉县，新建起铁厂后，及时解决了当前制作和修补农具的用铁需要。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州过去工业生产很落后，今年全州计划要新建小型厂矿七百多个。这个地区的地下资源丰富，几年来已发现的矿床就有铁、煤、磷、石油等许多种。已探明的铁矿，开发后可以基本上满足现在全州工农业生产的需要。
