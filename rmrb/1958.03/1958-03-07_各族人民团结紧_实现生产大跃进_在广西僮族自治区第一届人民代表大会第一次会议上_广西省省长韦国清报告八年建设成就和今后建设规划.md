Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 6th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will strive to achieve an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu in the next six years, and the total industrial output value will catch up with or exceed the agricultural and sideline production value. Guangxi Province Governor Wei Guoqing proposed this Great Leap Forward goal to the representatives today in his report on the region's future tasks at the People's Congress meeting of the Autonomous Region.

In his report entitled "Eight Years of Government Work in Guangxi Province and Future Tasks of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," Wei Guoqing first spoke about Guangxi's socialist transformation work over the past eight years. He said: Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, Guangxi, like the rest of the country, has achieved a basic victory in the socialist revolution. Now, Guangxi has not only basically completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, but also achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. This great revolutionary movement has fundamentally changed Guangxi's socio-economic foundation, political landscape, class relations, ethnic relations, and even brought about great changes in people's ideology. In this way, our socialist production Great Leap Forward has a political and ideological guarantee, and social productive forces will gain unparalleled vitality and develop at an astonishing speed. This is precisely the important reason why we can achieve a Great Leap Forward in production.

Wei Guoqing then spoke about Guangxi's socialist construction work over the past eight years. He said: Before liberation, Guangxi's agricultural production level was very low. Only seven million mu of cultivated land in the region had irrigation facilities, and the rest of the fields relied on rainfall. Farming techniques were very crude. This resulted in very low yields of crops in Guangxi, despite being located in a subtropical zone with several harvests a year. The region's grain output, taking the highest-yielding year of 1933 as an example, was only 7.26 billion jin. In the eight years since liberation, we have carried out a series of other tasks in promoting the development of agricultural productive forces, in addition to completing land reform and agricultural cooperativization. By the first half of 1957, the irrigated area through water conservancy projects totaled 13 million mu, plus the original 7 million mu before liberation, which is almost three times that before liberation; the cultivated area expanded by 4.9 million mu compared with before liberation, and the sown area expanded by 20.35 million mu. Great achievements have also been made in the promotion of advanced technologies and the use of new-style agricultural tools. Grain output increased to 10.8 billion jin in 1957, an increase of 48% compared with the highest year before liberation. In this way, Guangxi has changed from a grain-deficient area in history to a self-sufficient area.

In terms of developing industrial production, he said: Before liberation, Guangxi did not have a single factory with modern scale, nor did it have any industrial products with a position in domestic and foreign markets. As for the exploration of geological and water resources, it had never been carried out systematically. The eight years since liberation have greatly changed the face of industry, just like agriculture. During the first Five-Year Plan period alone, 418 independently accounted industrial enterprises were newly built and rebuilt. Now, we already have modern-scale sugar making, food, chemical industry, machinery, electric power, and metallurgical industries. Our region has begun to become one of the country's major sugar industry bases, and industrial products such as gasoline engines, gold, tin, manganese, zinc oxide powder, and rosin occupy an important position in the country. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the output value of industry in our region (excluding handicrafts) increased by 3.13 times.

Great achievements have also been made in geological and water resources exploration work.

In terms of developing transportation and postal and telecommunications services, the mileage of new and restored highways in Guangxi in the past eight years is equivalent to 1.7 times the mileage built during the more than 30 years of Kuomintang rule. Before liberation, 29 county towns in the region were not accessible by automobiles. Now, except for Pingnan, Tengxian, Yongfu, and Laibin, the four county towns accessible by ships and along the railway line, all other counties, including the large mountainous county towns that were always considered impossible to reach by vehicles, are accessible by automobiles. The total railway mileage is 1,360 kilometers, which is 2.72 times that before liberation. The total navigation mileage in the region is 7,582.4 kilometers, an increase of 25.4% compared with before liberation.

In terms of developing cultural, educational, and health work, there is now an average of one college student for every 4,913 people, one middle school student for every 110 people, and one primary school student for every 8.5 people. The number of health institutions (hospitals, health centers, and stations) in the region has developed to 1,337, achieving the goal of having hospitals and specialized prevention and control institutions in every county and health centers in every district. Smallpox has been eradicated, and diseases such as plague and cholera have been controlled; schistosomiasis and malaria have been greatly reduced after active prevention and control work.

In the past eight years, Guangxi has actively promoted ethnic regional autonomy in ethnic minority-inhabited and mixed-ethnic areas, and has trained 51,392 ethnic minority cadres (excluding township cadres). The Zhuang language has been created and promoted, and more than 500,000 people have participated in learning the Zhuang language.

When talking about achieving a Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, Wei Guoqing said: The goal of our region's Great Leap Forward is: in terms of agricultural production, to strive to achieve an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu in the next six years, while vigorously developing cash crops, afforestation, animal husbandry, and sideline production. In terms of industrial production (including handicrafts), the total output value should catch up with or exceed the production value of agriculture and sideline industries in the next six years. In heavy industry, we will focus on developing iron and steel, coal, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, and electric power; in light industry, we will focus on developing sugar making, paper making, and food. After achieving the above goals, there will be a leap forward change in the economic outlook of our region. While achieving a Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, it is also necessary to develop transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings accordingly.

Finally, Wei Guoqing said: To achieve a Great Leap Forward in production, we must mobilize all ethnic groups and cadres to unite and work hard actively. The great achievements of various aspects of work in the past few years have been achieved under this unity and hard work. However, among a few cadres, there are still Han chauvinism and local nationalism ideologies. The existence of these ideologies is not conducive to unity and the development of socialist construction, and they must be criticized and overcome in this rectification movement. At present, we should focus on opposing localist tendencies. The people of all ethnic groups in our region must deeply understand that only by strengthening the great unity of all ethnic groups can we accelerate the great victory of socialist construction, and only by taking the socialist road can we realize the common aspirations of all ethnic groups for a prosperous and happy life. After the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, we must better unite in the big family of the motherland, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, contribute our strength to accelerating the socialist construction of the motherland.

    各族人民团结紧　实现生产大跃进
    在广西僮族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上
    广西省省长韦国清报告八年建设成就和今后建设规划
    据新华社南宁6日电　广西僮族自治区在今后六年内，粮食产量争取平均每亩八百斤，工业生产总值要赶上或超过农副业生产总值。广西省省长韦国清今天在自治区人民代表大会会议上报告自治区今后任务的时候，向代表们提出了这个大跃进目标。
    韦国清在题为“广西省八年来政府工作和广西僮族自治区今后任务”的报告中，首先讲到广西八年来的社会主义改造工作。他说：在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，广西和全国一样，社会主义革命已经取得基本胜利。现在，广西不但已经基本上完成生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，而且在政治思想战线上的社会主义革命也取得了决定性的胜利。经过这一伟大的革命运动，根本改变了广西的社会经济基础、政治面貌、阶级关系、民族关系，以致在人们的思想意识方面也起了很大的变化。这样，我们社会主义生产大跃进有了政治思想上的保证，社会生产力就会取得无比的活力以惊人速度向前发展，这正是我们所以能够实现生产大跃进的重要原因。
    韦国清接着讲到广西八年来的社会主义建设工作。他说：解放以前，广西的农业生产水平很低，全区耕地有灌溉设备的只有七百万亩，其余田地就都是望天田，耕作技术十分粗放。这样就使广西虽然处在一年几熟的亚热带，但农作物的产量却很低。全区粮食产量以1933年的最高产年为例，也只有七十二点六亿斤。解放后八年来，我们在促进农业生产力的发展方面，除先后完成了土地改革和农业合作化以外，还进行了一系列其他的工作。到1957年上半年为止，兴修水利的灌溉面积共一千三百万亩，加上解放前原有的七百万亩，差不多等于解放前的三倍；耕地面积比解放前扩大四百九十万亩，播种面积扩大二千零三十五万亩。在先进技术的推广和新式农具的使用等方面，也都取得了很大的成绩。粮食产量到1957年增加到一百零八亿斤，比解放前的最高年份增加了48％。这样，广西就从历史上的缺粮地区，变成自给地区。
    在发展工业生产方面，他说：解放前的广西没有一座具有现代化规模的工厂，也没有一种在国内外市场上有地位的工业产品。至于地质和水利资源的勘探工作，从来没有系统地进行过。解放后的八年，同农业一样大大地改变了面貌。只在第一个五年计划期间，新建和改建了四百一十八个独立核算的工业企业。现在，我们已经有了现代规模的制糖、食品、化学工业、机械、电力、矿冶等工业。我区已开始成为全国主要糖业基地之一，工业产品，如汽油机、黄金、锡、锰、锌氧粉和松香等，已在国内占有重要的地位。在第一个五年计划期内，我区工业（不包括手工业）的产值增长了三点一三倍。
    地质和水利资源勘查工作方面，也获得了很大的成绩。
    在发展交通运输和邮电事业方面，广西公路八年来新建和恢复的里程，相当于国民党统治三十多年所建里程的一点七倍。解放前全区有二十九个县城不通汽车，现在除了通轮船和沿铁路线的平南、藤县、永福、来宾四个县城外，其余的县包括一向认为没法通车的大山区县城在内，全部通车了。铁路通车里程共有一千三百六十公里，等于解放前的二点七二倍。全区航运里程有七千五百八十二点四公里，比解放前增加了25.4％。　　在发展文教卫生工作方面，现在平均每四千九百一十三人中有一个大学生，一百一十人中有一个中学生，八点五人中有一个小学生。全区卫生事业机构（医院、卫生院、所）发展为一千三百三十七处，作到了县县有医院和专业防治机构，区区有卫生所。扑灭了天花，控制了鼠疫和霍乱等疾病；血吸虫病和疟疾在积极进行防治工作之后已经大大减少。
    八年来，广西在民族聚居和民族杂居地区积极推行了民族区域自治，培养了民族干部五万一千三百九十二人（乡干部没有统计在内）。创制和推广了僮文，参加学习僮文的已有五十多万人。
    韦国清在讲到实现工农业生产大跃进的时候说：我区大跃进的目标是：在农业生产方面，今后六年内争取粮食产量平均每亩八百斤，同时要大力发展经济作物、植树造林，牧畜和副业生产等。在工业生产（包括手工业）方面，要在今后六年内生产总值赶上或超过农副业的生产总值。重工业方面着重发展钢铁、煤、机器制造、化工电力等，轻工业方面着重发展制糖、造纸、食品等。在达到了上述目标之后，我区的经济面貌将有一个飞跃的变化。在工农业大跃进的同时，还必须相应地发展交通运输和文教卫生事业。
    最后，韦国清说：我们要实现生产大跃进，就必须要动员全体各族人民和干部，团结一致积极努力。过去几年来各方面工作的伟大成就，就是在这种团结一致和努力工作下取得的。但是，在少数干部当中，还存在着大汉族主义和地方民族主义思想，这种思想的存在，是不利于团结和不利于社会主义建设事业发展的，都必须在这次整风运动中加以批判和克服。当前，应当着重反对地方主义的倾向。我们全区各族人民都必须深刻认识，只有加强各民族大团结才能加速地取得社会主义建设的伟大胜利，也只有走社会主义道路，才能使各族人民实现我们繁荣幸福生活的共同愿望。在广西僮族自治区成立以后，我们必须更好地团结在祖国大家庭里，在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的领导下，为加速祖国的社会主义建设而贡献出我们的力量。
