　　No Tragedy on the Milky Way – Watching the Feature Film "Son of a Herdsman"

　　The film "Son of a Herdsman" is like a high-pitched and clear pastoral song on the grassland, singing the love and happiness of the Mongolian people, singing their firm belief and heroic spirit in advancing towards socialism, and also singing their love and gratitude for the Communist Party.
　　The film shows the moving scene of the vigorous development and prosperity of the pastoral economy in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. On the rich grassland, cattle and sheep are in flocks, and the herders are well-fed and well-clothed, showing a thriving scene! This is precisely the picture of life that has generally appeared in the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region under the leadership of the Party. In the past thirteen years, life has undergone such great changes. The bitter days under the rule of princes, nobles, and feudal herdlords have now become only painful memories for the people. In order to get rid of poverty and misfortune forever, the herders are determined to do their best to build a better socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party. The film depicts the herders of Yinhe Village building water conservancy projects to divert the Yinhe River to the waterless Bayantala pasture, which reveals the universal demands and high socialist construction enthusiasm of the herders under the situation of the rapid development of the pastoral economy.
　　Not everyone likes this project, such as Arsland and Jiergala, the old feudal herdlords, who tried every means to stir up trouble and undermine the project, hoping to eventually make the herders leave the leadership of the Party. Nor does everyone care about and support this project, such as District Chief Buren and Deputy Village Chief Amuga. He does not care about the interests of the masses. Everything is careless, muddling along, believing in slander, and irresponsible. His work creed is "seeking no merit, but seeking no fault." In life, it is this bureaucracy that has brought great damage to the revolution and work! Amuga is an extremely selfish individualist. In order to seize Deliger's lover, Gengentawuya, as his wife, he was willing to be used by Arsland and others, listening to their instigation and obstructing the progress of the water conservancy project. This small and despicable soul has rotted and degenerated to the point of being incurable. These vividly illustrate that when a person's soul is permeated with the poison of individualism, he will eventually go to the shameful path of destroying the Party, the people, and socialism!
　　However, no matter whether it is the remaining feudal forces who are unwilling to step down obediently, or bureaucracy, or extreme individualism, they cannot stop the progress of history, and will eventually be crushed by the firm steps of the people. The water diversion project was finally completed! The Yinhe River re-irrigated the Bayantala grassland. This is the victory of the people's will and the power of the masses! This is the victory of socialism! This is the victory of the Party's great and correct ethnic policy!
　　The love between the demobilized soldier, hero Deliger, and the beautiful Gengentawuya is an attractive thread running through the entire film "Son of a Herdsman." From their love entanglement, not only the difficult and complex process of economic construction in Yinhe Village is introduced like peeling cocoons, but also the spiritual outlook of the characters is deeply revealed. The actress Gengentana successfully portrayed the strong and kind character of Gengentawuya, a new Mongolian woman. This Mongolian girl who firmly pursues a better life, her strong love and hate, clear right and wrong, strong courage, and diligent and lively character, constitute the most moving image in the film.
　　This lovely character is an important guarantee for Gengentawuya to obtain true happiness and love. Of course, the most fundamental guarantee lies in this era and society. The Yinhe River runs across the grassland, dividing it into the east and west banks. However, in this society, the "Weaver Girl" on the east bank and the "Cowherd" on the west bank no longer need the pity of magpies, because no one can create tragedy on the Milky Way anymore.
　　The film describes Deliger's spiritual activities quite richly and meticulously. He was once a combat hero, but he was almost defeated in the complex struggle of life. The film does not portray him as a legendary hero who comes and goes alone. No, he is actually an ordinary person with flesh and blood. Whether his work is successful or not is not due to any extraordinary ability, but depends on whether he stands with the masses and becomes one with them. At first, when he led the construction of the river, the herders on the east bank were hesitant to move forward, but later when the masses were mobilized and fully realized the great significance of the project, even if the mountain torrents washed away the river dam, the masses had no complaints, on the contrary, they fully supported Deliger to persevere and continue to build the river well. However, there is a bit too much description of Deliger's negative emotions when he encounters difficulties and failures. Of course, these places happen to describe the Party's leadership and support, the improvement of the masses' awareness, and the complexity of Deliger's character, but it always makes people feel that Deliger seems to lack something important, something that every true hero must have.
　　The personalities of the other characters in "Son of a Herdsman" are also very prominent. Like Huhebari's forthrightness and simplicity, and Arsland's sinister cunning, all leave a deep impression on people. Especially the Party Branch Secretary Te Ge Xi, his simple and honest, firm and calm personality, his in-depth and meticulous work style of closely connecting with the masses, his care and love for young people, and his unique singing and storytelling skills that are often used as educational means, make the image of this old party member particularly vivid and charming, and also has a strong national characteristic, which makes people unforgettable for a long time.

    银河上没有悲剧——看故事片“牧人之子”
　  贺宜
    影片“牧人之子”像草原上一支高吭嘹亮的牧歌，唱出了蒙古族人民的爱情和幸福，唱出了他们向社会主义前进的坚定信念和豪迈心情，也唱出了他们对共产党的热爱和感激。
    影片表现了内蒙古自治区牧业经济蓬勃发展和欣欣向荣的动人情景。在富饶的草原上，牛羊成群，牧民们丰衣足食，一派兴旺气象！这正是内蒙古自治区在党的领导下，普遍出现在牧区内的生活图景。十三年来，生活已经起了这样大的变化。王公贵族封建牧主统治下的苦日子，现在只成为人们痛苦的记忆了。牧民们为了永远摆脱穷困和不幸，决心在共产党的领导下竭尽全力来建设美好的社会主义。影片描写银河村的牧民们兴修水利，要把银河引到没有水的巴彦塔拉牧场去，正揭示了在牧业经济飞跃发展的形势下，牧民们的普遍要求和高涨的社会主义建设热情。
    并不是所有的人都喜欢这个工程的，例如阿尔斯郎、吉尔嘎拉这些旧日的封建牧主们，他们千方百计，掀风作浪想搞垮工程，以期最后使牧民们离开党的领导。也并不是所有的人都关心和支持这个工程的，例如区长卜仁和副村长阿木嘎等就是这样。他不关心群众利益。一切马马虎虎，得过且过，轻信谗言，不负责任，他的工作信条就是“但求无过，不求有功”。在生活中，正是这种官僚主义给革命和工作带来了巨大的损害！阿木嘎是个极端自私自利的个人主义者。为了想夺取德力格尔的情人格根涛娅做妻子，甘受阿尔斯郎们的利用，听他们的调唆，阻挠水利工程的进行。这个渺小卑鄙的灵魂已经腐烂堕落到不可救药的地步了。这些正是形象地说明：当一个人的灵魂中浸透了个人主义毒液的时候，最后必然会走向可耻的反党反人民反社会主义的毁灭道路！
    但是，不管是不甘心乖乖下台的残余封建力量，不管是官僚主义还是极端个人主义，都不能阻挡历史的前进，最后必然要被人民的坚定步伐所踹扁。引水工程到底修成了！银河重新灌溉着巴彦塔拉草原。这是人民意志和群众力量的胜利！这是社会主义的胜利！这是党的伟大而正确的民族政策的胜利！
    复员军人，英雄德力格尔和美丽的格根涛娅的爱情，是“牧人之子”中贯穿全剧的一根吸引人的线。从他们的爱情纠葛中，不但抽茧剥蕉般地把银河村经济建设的艰难复杂的过程介绍了出来，而且也深刻地揭露了人物的精神面貌。演员格根塔娜成功地表现了格根涛娅这个蒙古族新女性坚强善良的性格。这位坚定不移地追求美好生活的蒙古族姑娘，她的爱憎强烈，是非分明，坚强勇敢，勤劳活泼的性格，构成了影片最动人的一个形象。
    这种可爱的性格正是格根涛娅获得真正的幸福和爱情的重要保证。当然，最根本的保证还是在于这个时代和社会。银河横互在草原上，分成了河东和河西。但是，在这个社会里，河东的“织女”和河西的“牛郎”再也不需要喜鹊的怜悯，因为谁也不能在银河上制造悲剧了。
    影片对德力格尔的精神活动是描写得相当丰富细致的。他曾经是一个战斗英雄，但在生活的复杂斗争中却几乎给打垮了。影片并没有把他描写成一个独往独来传奇式的英雄，不，他实实在在是一个普通的有血有肉的人物。他的工作无论是成功还是失败，都不是由于什么非凡的能力，而是取决于他是否和群众站在一起并打成一片。起初他领导修河的时候，河东牧民观望不前，但是后来当群众被发动起来，并且充分认识到工程的重大意义的时候，就是山洪冲垮了河坝，群众也毫无怨言，相反还全力支持德力格尔再接再厉，一定要把河修好。不过，描写德力格尔遭遇困难和失败时的消极情绪嫌多了一点。固然，在这些地方正好描写了党的领导和支持，群众觉悟的提高，以及德力格尔性格的复杂性，但总使人感到在德力格尔身上似乎还缺乏什么重要的东西，这种东西是每一个真正的英雄所必须具有的。
      “牧人之子”中的其他几个人物的性格也很突出。像胡和巴日的豪爽单纯，阿尔斯郎的阴险奸刁，都给人很深的印象。特别是党支书特戈希，他的淳厚朴实坚毅沉着的个性，深入细致密切联系群众的工作作风，对青年的关心和爱护，以及他那别具一格的经常用作教育手段的说唱才能，使这个年老的党员的形象分外鲜明而富有魅力，而且具有浓厚的民族特色，使人久久不能忘怀。
