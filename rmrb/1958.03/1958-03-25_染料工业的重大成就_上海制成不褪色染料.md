Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 24th: The latest technological achievement in the world's dye industry – reactive dyes – has been successfully test-produced at the Runhua Dye Factory in Shanghai.

Reactive dyes can create a chemical reaction with textiles, so they do not fade when washed with water or soap, exposed to the sun, affected by sweat, or subjected to friction. Even if clothes are worn out and torn, the color remains as bright as new. Before the invention of this type of dye, there were no non-fading dyes in the world.

Reactive dyes can dye cotton, silk, linen, wool, and various nylons, and have the characteristics of bright and uniform color, and can be dyed at low temperatures.

Britain only officially issued a domestic patent for reactive dyes in September last year. Currently, only Britain and Switzerland can produce reactive dyes.

China's reactive dyes were successfully researched and trial-produced by Xi Xiangyun, a technician at the Runhua Dye Factory, and two assistants. Xi Xiangyun has been paying attention to the development of reactive dyes in Britain; the call to catch up with Britain further encouraged his determination to trial-produce them. British magazines began to heavily promote reactive dyes from the second half of 1956, but did not reveal any information about manufacturing technology. Relying on leadership support and the concerted efforts of his assistants, Xi Xiangyun sought clues based on the descriptions of the characteristics, performance, and usage of "reactive dyes" in foreign magazine advertisements, and devoted himself to painstaking research day and night, finally succeeding in the experiment on January 6 this year. In the past two months, they have trial-produced dyes in seven colors, which have been tested by the Central Laboratory of the Paint and Dye Industry Corporation and used by the Silk Industry Corporation, proving that they meet reactive standards.

The Runhua Dye Factory is currently being expanded in preparation for the production of this reactive dye.

    染料工业的重大成就
    上海制成不褪色染料
    据新华社上海24日电　世界染料工业最新的技术成就——活性染料，已在上海润华染料厂试成。
    活性染料能与纺织品起一种化学作用，因此水洗、皂洗、日晒、汗渍和摩擦都不褪色，即使衣服穿旧着破，颜色仍鲜艳如新。在这种染料发明以前，世界上还没有不褪色的染料。
    活性染料可以染棉、丝、麻、毛和各种尼龙，并且具有色泽鲜艳均匀、能在低温中染色等特点。
    英国去年9月才正式颁布活性染料国内专利权。活性染料目前只有英国和瑞士两国能够生产。
    我国活性染料是由润华染料厂技术员奚翔云和两名助手一起研究试制成功的。奚翔云一直在注意英国发明活性染料的动向；赶上英国的号召更加鼓舞了他的试制决心。英国的一些杂志从1956年下半年起就对活性染料大肆宣扬了，但是没有透露出一点关于制造技术的资料。奚翔云依靠领导支持和助手的同心协力，根据外国杂志刊物广告上关于“活性染料”的特点、性能、用法等情况的介绍，从中寻找线索，日夜苦思钻研，终于在今年1月6日试验成功。两个多月来，他们已试制出七种颜色的染料，经过造漆染料工业公司中心试验室的测定和丝绸工业公司试用，证明合乎活性标准。
    润华染料厂目前正在扩建，准备生产这种活性染料。
