Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th (TASS): One thousand three hundred and ninety Indian monkeys soared ten thousand miles aboard a "Tu-104" aircraft from Delhi to Moscow.

These Macaca mulatta monkeys were purchased by the Soviet Union for medical scientific research, specifically for the production of serum to treat infantile paralysis.

According to staff at the Soviet Ministry of Health's Scientific Research Institute for Anti-Poliomyelitis Preparations, the journey, which lasted a full day and night, was very smooth. Many "passengers" slept during the flight. The temperature on the plane was maintained close to that which the animals were accustomed to in their homeland. A constant supply of warm, fresh air was provided to their cages, each holding ten to fifteen monkeys.

When the plane landed at Vnukovo Airport, a light breeze was blowing in Moscow and the air was cold. To prevent these southern visitors from catching a cold, the cages were covered with special woolen covers. Warm blankets were also placed over the cages when the monkeys were transported from the airport to the city in insulated vans.

The monkeys are now settled in an animal breeding center near Moscow under the care of doctors.

    孙悟空的子孙腾云驾雾
    一千多印度猴子空运莫斯科
    新华社6日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：一千三百九十只印度猴子乘“图—104”式飞机翱翔万里，从德里飞到了莫斯科。
    这些马卡卡—列祖斯种猴子是苏联买来供医学科学研究使用的，特别准备用来制取医治小儿麻痹症的血清。
    据苏联卫生部抗小儿麻痹症药剂科学研究所工作人员说，这一次历时一昼夜的旅途一路很平安。飞行期间很多“乘客”睡了觉。飞机上保持着接近于这些动物在它们故乡所习惯的气温。不断有温暖的新鲜空气送到它们的笼中去，每个笼子装十只到十五只猴子。
    当飞机在伏努科夫机场着陆时，莫斯科刮着微风，空气寒冷。为了防止这些南国来客感冒，笼子罩上了用毛织物做成的特殊的套子。在用保温大轿车把这些猴子从飞机场运往市区时，笼子上也还盖着暖和的被子。
    现在这些猴子在医生的照顾下已经在莫斯科附近的动物饲养所定居下来。
