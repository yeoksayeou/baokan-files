    A True Comedy
    Not long ago, such a story occurred at the China Pingju Theatre: A cadre initially had many concerns about being sent to lower levels. He was reluctant to leave his comfortable small family, fearing "hardship" in the countryside and that the countryside was "dirty," etc. He encouraged his wife to hold him back so he could avoid being sent down on a pretext. However, with the help of the leadership, comrades, and his wife, this cadre finally recognized the importance of the Party's measure of transforming intellectuals and resolved to temper and transform himself through labor, so as to become both a "red" and "expert" cadre.
    Now, this story has been adapted into a comedy, "For the Sake of Red," by Xue Enhou, the vice president of the China Pingju Theatre. The famous Pingju actress Xiao Bai Yushuang successfully portrayed the image of a street activist in this play.
    The actors of the Second Team of the China Pingju Theatre rehearsed this play in a short period of time. The formal rehearsal time for the entire play was only fifteen hours.

    真实的喜剧
    不久前，在中国评剧院里曾发生了这样一个故事：有一个干部开始对下放存在许多顾虑，他留恋自己舒适的小家庭，怕到农村吃“苦”，怕农村“脏”等等。他怂恿他的妻子拖他的后腿，好借故逃避下放。但是在领导上和同志们以及他的妻子的帮助下，这个干部终于认清了党对知识分子改造的这一措施的重要性，决心到劳动中去锻炼改造，使自己成为又红又专的干部。
    现在，这个故事已经由中国评剧院副院长薛恩厚编成喜剧“为了红”。评剧名演员小白玉霜在这个剧中成功地刻划了一个街道积极分子的形象。
    中国评剧院二队的演员们在短期内赶排了这个剧，整个剧的正式排练时间只用了十五个小时。
