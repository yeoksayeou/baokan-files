Xinhua News Agency dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower convened his main economic advisors again on the 13th to discuss ways to deal with the economic recession. This was the third meeting on the economic recession that Eisenhower had held in three days. Eisenhower had convened Republican congressional leaders on the 11th to discuss countermeasures to deal with the surge in unemployment, and on the 12th he met with Treasury Secretary Anderson to discuss the economic recession.

Those participating in the meeting on the 13th included: Treasury Secretary Anderson, Labor Secretary Mitchell, Commerce Secretary Weeks, and the President's chief economic advisor, Hauge. Sources said that at this meeting, these U.S. economic officials discussed with Eisenhower plans to increase public spending and, "if necessary," to stimulate economic activity through tax cuts.

U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy stated on the 13th that the United States was prepared to deal with the economic recession by stepping up military orders.

In a letter to Eisenhower, he said that in the first half of this year, the Department of Defense will sign contracts worth more than $10 billion for missiles, aircraft, and other military equipment. In the second half of 1957, the value of such orders was $6 billion. White House Press Secretary Hagerty called McElroy's plan "another way to help the U.S. economy deal with the recession."

At the same time, the development of the economic recession and the increasing difficulties of government finances prompted U.S. Budget Director Percival Brundage to resign on the 13th.

U.S. President Eisenhower appointed Deputy Budget Director Maurice Stans to replace Brundage.

Brundage's sudden resignation surprised political figures in Washington. Some economic observers pointed out that Brundage's resignation was due to disagreements with the government on fiscal policy. They pointed out that the U.S. government currently has two main types of countermeasures to the economic recession: one is to stimulate business activity by increasing government spending, that is, increasing military spending and public works spending; the other is a proposed reduction in government revenue, that is, cutting taxes to increase purchasing power. But regardless of which method is used, the result will be an unbalanced budget, resulting in a fiscal deficit. Brundage, as the director of the government budget bureau, wanted a balanced budget.

    经济衰退遏制不住　失业人数与日俱增
    美政府连日会商仍乏对策
    预算局长无法平衡预算知难引退
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔13日又召集他的主要经济顾问们商讨对付经济衰退的办法。这是艾森豪威尔在三天之内举行的第三次关于经济衰退问题的会议。艾森豪威尔在11日曾经召集国会共和党领袖商讨过应付失业激增的对策，在12日又召见了财政部长安德逊商谈过经济衰退问题。
    参加13日会议的有：财政部长安德逊，劳工部长密契尔，商务部长威克斯和总统首席经济顾问豪吉。消息说，在这次会议上，这些美国经济负责官员同艾森豪威尔讨论了关于增加公共开支计划以及“如果必要”用减税来刺激经济活动的问题。
    美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊13日表示美国准备用加紧军备订货的办法来对付经济衰退。
    他在给艾森豪威尔的一封信中说，在今年上半年中，国防部将在导弹、飞机和其他军事设备方面签订价值一百亿美元以上的合同。在1957 年的下半年中，这类订货的价值为六十亿美元。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂把麦克艾罗伊的计划称之为“能够帮助美国经济来对付衰退的又一种办法”。
    与此同时，由于经济衰退的发展和政府财政的日益困难促使美国预算局局长珀锡伐耳·布伦戴奇在13日提出辞职。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔任命了预算局副局长莫里斯·斯坦斯接替布伦戴奇的职务。
    布伦戴奇的突然辞职使华盛顿的政界人士感到惊奇。据一些经济观察家指出布伦戴奇的辞职是因为他同政府在财政政策上有分歧。他们指出，美国政府目前对经济衰退采取的对策大致有两类：一类是用增加政府支出，即增加军费和公共工程开支的办法来刺激企业活动；另外一类是拟议中的减少政府收入，即削减税收的办法来增加购买力。但不管那一类办法，其结果都将导致预算失去平衡，使财政收支出现赤字。而身为政府预算局局长的布伦戴奇则希望有一个平衡的预算。
