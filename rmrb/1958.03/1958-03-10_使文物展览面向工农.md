Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Representatives from museums, cultural relic units, and cultural administrative departments across the country issued a proposal in Beijing on the 8th to cultural relic workers and museums nationwide, striving for a great leap forward in their work. Representatives from the cultural relic departments proposed in the proposal to complete the review of key "cultural relic protection units" in their respective regions within one year, a task originally scheduled to take three years. They also planned to clear and register all cultural relic data accumulated over the past seven years within two years.

Representatives from various museums put forward the idea of "competing in displays, competing in attracting audiences, competing in preservation, competing in publicity, competing in frugality, and competing in being both Red and expert." They also planned to adopt various methods such as diverse exhibitions and mobile exhibitions to bring artifact exhibitions to the countryside and factories, making them accessible to workers and peasants.

    使文物展览面向工农
    据新华社9日讯　各地博物馆和文物单位及文化行政部门的代表8日在北京向全国文物工作者和博物馆发出争取工作大跃进的倡议。文物部门的代表在倡议书中提出，要在一年内做好预定三年才能完成的本地区重点“文物保护单位”的复查工作；并在两年内将过去七年积压的文物资料全部清理登记。
    各博物馆的代表在倡议书中提出了“比陈列，比观众，比保管，比宣传，比勤俭，比红专”，并拟采用多种展览、流动展览等办法，使文物展览下乡下厂，面向工农。
