To Guarantee a Bumper Harvest of Summer Crops

The Hubei Daily published an editorial on March 16th entitled "Ensuring a Bumper Harvest of Summer Crops." The editorial stated that the spring seedlings are growing very well in most areas of Hubei, and they have sufficient confidence to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops. The editorial then pointed out: This does not mean that there are no problems with increasing the yield of summer crops this year; on the contrary, there are still many problems. First, from now until the summer crops mature, there are nearly two months, during which all kinds of spring seedlings urgently need people to process and cultivate them. At the same time, various natural disasters may also occur during this period. If we cannot prevent these possible natural disasters, the current prospect of a bumper harvest may turn into no harvest at all. Second, although most summer crops are growing well, there are still many shortcomings and loopholes in crop cultivation and field management in some areas. For example, third-class seedlings have not been completely eliminated, and some areas even lack confidence in eliminating them; some areas have done a poor job of ditching and draining waterlogged fields; some places, due to historical habits, do not weed or fertilize spring crops, or do so very carelessly; some areas have turned spring seedlings that they consider to be growing poorly into green manure; some places have not determined the yield and measures for summer crops down to the field level. These shortcomings and loopholes are extremely harmful to striving for increased production of summer crops. Third, some leading cadres in certain areas (including commune and team cadres) have already developed complacency and a sense of self-satisfaction. They believe that this year's spring seedlings are growing better than last year's, more fertilizer has been applied than last year, and more effort has been put in, so there will be no problem with increasing production. Therefore, the processing, cultivation, and management of spring seedlings have been relaxed. The fact that six thousand mu of broad bean seedlings in Jiayu County were eaten by insects, resulting in no harvest, occurred under these circumstances.

Are the aforementioned shortcomings and loopholes only occurring in certain areas of Hubei Province? No, many places also have this phenomenon, but the severity varies. Therefore, the problems pointed out in the Hubei Daily editorial are worth noting in all areas.

How to solve these problems existing in the current field management of summer crops? The Hubei Daily editorial called for launching a mass inspection. The participants in the inspection should not only be cadres, but more importantly, the masses should inspect themselves. The inspection should be thorough and careful, inspecting commune by commune, team by team, and field by field. The problems identified during the inspection should be immediately studied and solved on the spot. Secondly, each region should study and develop solutions based on its own different situations and existing problems, and act quickly. Ditches should be dug where there are no ditches, and ditches that are not well-dug should be improved, ensuring that every plot has a ditch and every ditch can drain water. Weeds should be quickly removed where there has been no weeding, and weeds should be removed as many times as possible. For third-class seedlings, we should seize the opportunity to continue processing and cultivating them. If fertilizer needs to be applied, it should be applied as soon as possible. The idea of not wanting to fertilize third-class seedlings is wrong and must be corrected. All summer crops that can be harvested must be harvested. Try not to turn barley, broad beans, and peas into green manure, or prohibit turning them into green manure, as this is of great importance to ensuring increased production of summer crops. We must be determined to prevent all preventable natural disasters and eliminate all eliminable natural disasters.

The mass inspection proposed by the Hubei Daily is a good method. Doing so has at least two major benefits: First, the inspection is thorough. It can enable the inspection work to go deep into every production team and every field; Second, it is easy to mobilize the masses to study specific solutions based on specific circumstances. It should be admitted that although many regions attach great importance to inspection work, conducting a province-wide mass inspection, requiring in-depth inspection of every field, is indeed a new thing and worth promoting.

The planting area of winter wheat accounts for 22% of the total grain area in the country, and its output accounts for about 13% of the total grain output in the country; the output of rapeseed also accounts for 20% of the output of edible oilseeds. It can be seen that ensuring a bumper harvest of summer crops is of great significance for achieving the national grain production increase task this year.

### 保证夏收作物大丰收

    保证夏收作物大丰收
    湖北日报3月16日以“确保夏收作物大丰收”为题发表了社论。社论说，目前湖北大部分地区的春苗长的都很好，他们有足够的信心，确保夏收作物大丰收。接着社论指出：这不是说今年夏收作物的增产就没有问题了，相反的是问题还不少。第一，从目前算起，到夏收作物成熟还有近两个月的时间，在这一段时间里，各种春苗都还迫切需要人们去加工培育。同时，在这一段时间里，还可能发生各种各样的自然灾害。如果我们不能防止这些可能发生的各种自然灾害，就可能由目前的丰收有望变成丰收无望。第二，尽管夏收作物大部生长良好，但仍有不少地区在作物的培育上和田间管理上还存在着不少的缺点和漏洞。如三类苗还没有被彻底消灭，甚至有些地区对消灭三类苗缺乏信心；有些地区对开沟排渍作的很差；有些地方由于历史习惯，对春收作物不进行锄草追肥或进行的很马虎；有些地区，把自己认为长得不好的春苗翻作了绿肥；有些地方，没有把夏收作物的产量、措施等定到田。这些缺点和漏洞，对争取夏收作物的增产有着极大的危害。第三，在某些地区的领导干部中（包括社、队干部），已经产生了麻痹思想和自满情绪，他们认为，今年的春苗比去年长得好，比去年追的肥多，下的功夫大，增产不会有问题。因此对春苗的加工培育和管理工作，无形中便松懈下来了。像嘉鱼县六千亩蚕豆苗被虫吃光，颗粒无收，就是在这种思想情况下发生的。
    上述这些缺点和漏洞，是不是仅只发生在湖北省的某些地区呢？不是的，不少地方也有这种现象，不过严重程度各有不同罢了。因此，湖北日报社论中指出的这些问题，值得各地注意。
    怎样解决目前夏收作物田间管理工作中存在的这些问题呢？湖北日报社论号召开展一次群众性的大检查。参加检查的不仅是干部，更重要的是要让群众自己去检查。要彻底的检查，仔细的检查，一个社一个社的去检查，一个队一个队的去检查，一块田一块田的去检查。对检查出来的问题，要立即研究就地解决。其次，各个地区要根据自己的不同情况和存在的问题，研究出办法，迅速地行动起来。没有开沟的要开沟，沟没有开好的要开好，要做到块块都开沟，沟沟能排水。没有锄草的地方，要赶快锄草，而且要尽可能的多锄几遍。对三类苗，应当抓紧时机，继续加工培育。需要追肥的，还要尽快的去追，那种不愿意给三类苗追肥的思想是错误的，必须纠正。凡是能够收到的夏收作物一定要收，尽量不把大麦、蚕、豌豆翻作绿肥，或者禁止把它翻作绿肥，这对保证夏收作物的增产有着重大的关系。要决心防止一切能够防止的自然灾害，消灭一切能够消灭的自然灾害。
    湖北日报提出的开展群众性大检查是个好办法。这样做起码有两大好处：第一、检查深入。可以使检查工作深入到每一个生产队，每一块田；第二、便于发动群众根据具体情况研究具体解决办法。应该承认，许多地区对检查工作虽然都很重视，但是开展全省范围的群众性大检查，要求深入到每一块田地去检查，这的确还是一件新事情，值得提倡。
    冬小麦的种植面积占全国粮食总面积的22％，产量占全国粮食总产量的13％左右；油菜籽的产量也占食用油料产量的20％。由此可见，确保夏收作物的大丰收，对实现全国今年粮食增产任务有重大意义。
