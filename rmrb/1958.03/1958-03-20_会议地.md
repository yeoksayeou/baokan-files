    Meeting Place
　　This event occurred in Hubei Province, in 1957, in Macheng County, in a village called Xianrenwan. The cadres there are not simple, they have a knack for improving their work style, and they first created a meeting place, occupying 1.93 mu. In the past, cadres held many meetings, which not only delayed production but also, more importantly, separated them from the masses, and subjective leadership caused great harm. Now the cadres have greatly changed, working in the fields from sunrise to sunset, attending meetings with their farm tools, both holding meetings and engaging in production. This field is also an experimental field, taking the lead in deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, with wide trenches and dense planting meeting the standards, and implementing all kinds of new technologies. From now on, leadership does not need shouting, facts speak with strength, everyone learns operational techniques, and every crop makes progress. May this practice spread in all directions, to agencies and factories, so that leadership meetings are all reformed, and overall progress in every field will not be difficult.

    会议地
　　蔡其矫此事发生湖北省，时在一九五七年，地方属于麻城县，村名叫做神仙垸。那里干部不简单，改进作风有板眼，首先创立会议地，占有一亩九分三。从前干部开会多，误了生产先不说，脱离群众事很大，主观领导害非浅。现在干部大转变，日出日入在田间，带上农具去开会，又开会来又生产。这田又是试验田，深耕细作它领先，宽沟密植合标准，革新技术样样全。从此领导不用喊，实事说话有力量，操作技术大家学，项项庄稼有进展。但愿此举播四方，传到机关和工厂，领导会议都改革，行行跃进总不难。
