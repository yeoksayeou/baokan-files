    Enthusiasm Plus Diligence
    "Completing five years' worth of work in four months" is the new plan put forward by veteran model worker Liao Shigang, a new Great Leap Forward target. The reason Liao Shigang dares to propose such a target is mainly because he has sufficient enthusiasm and sufficient diligence. With sufficient enthusiasm, he is never satisfied with his achievements, always striving to do more and contribute more to socialist construction. With sufficient diligence, he can continuously improve operations, enhance technology, and strive for perfection. Enthusiasm plus diligence allows us to complete production tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. When we learn from Liao Shigang and catch up with Liao Shigang, we must learn from Liao Shigang's enthusiasm and diligence.

    干劲加钻劲
    “四个月完成五年工作量”，这是老模范廖世刚提出的新打算，新的大跃进指标。廖世刚所以敢于提出这样的指标，主要是他的干劲足，钻劲足。干劲足，他就永远不满足于自己的成就，多了还要多，力争为社会主义建设多作些贡献。钻劲足，他就能不断地改进操作，提高技术，精益求精。干劲加钻劲，也就可以又多又快又好又省地完成生产任务。我们学廖世刚，赶廖世刚，就要学习廖世刚的干劲和钻劲。
