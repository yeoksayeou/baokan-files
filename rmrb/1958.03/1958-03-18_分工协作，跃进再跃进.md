Editor's Note: On March 13th, this newspaper invited some people from philosophical and social science circles in Beijing to hold a forum on how to achieve a leap forward in philosophical and social science work. The attendees were: Pan Zinian, Yu Guangyuan, Zheng Zhenduo, Jian Bozan, Jiang Junchen, Liu Danian, Zheng Xin, Dai Baitao, Sun Yefang, Zhou Xinmin, and Sun Dingguo. They expressed their opinions on this issue. The following is a record of their speeches.

Division of Labor and Cooperation, Leap Forward Again and Again
    Pan Zinian

The necessity and possibility of a great leap forward in philosophical and social sciences should now be beyond question. The question is how to achieve this great leap forward. Here, the issue of direction, which must be resolved first, should also be largely settled. We already have a long-term plan, and in 1958 we also have twenty key projects. However, it cannot be said that this plan and these projects have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people and become the action program of the vast number of scientists. The rationale behind our long-term plan and key projects must be accepted by everyone in order to transform it into a material force. Therefore, we must vigorously publicize them and organize forums everywhere to widely discuss the long-term plan, especially the twenty key projects for this year. Today, the People's Daily holding such a forum is excellent publicity work. It would be best if various regions could also organize such forums to strengthen this publicity work. The forums should follow the direction of distinguishing and correctly handling the two types of contradictions, as pointed out by Comrade Lu Dingyi in his article "Be a Promoter" written for the inaugural issue of "Jianghai Academic Journal," and unfold discussions on the long-term plan and the twenty key projects in accordance with the spirit of Comrade Chen Boda's speech at the Fifth Meeting of the Science Planning Commission, entitled "Emphasize the Present, Underestimate the Past, Learn While Doing." On the one hand, we hope to collect opinions on the long-term plan and key projects from various forums so that they can be revised if necessary. More importantly, we hope that everyone can volunteer to undertake research or writing tasks in the plan, especially in the key projects, during or after the forums. This is the most urgent and also a very arduous organizational task at present.

The ranks of philosophical and social sciences are not strong enough at present. But in reality, the strength is not too small, it is just scattered in various work positions in various places. If we can use scientific planning, especially key projects, as the center to organize these forces, we can form a strong team, and we can make the philosophical and social sciences leap forward again and again. The form of organization can be diverse and unconventional, such as societies, research associations, etc., can be used. It is best for each locality to set an annual scientific research plan for the locality, and for each individual to set an annual scientific research plan for themselves. The plans set by each other should be able to cooperate with each other and divide the work. There should also be a major collaboration here. On the economic front, the major collaboration in Taiyuan and the major collaboration in Shanghai supporting six provinces can and should become our good examples. Collaboration is what we should particularly emphasize at present, because without collaboration, a strong team cannot be formed. And the lack of collaboration is the biggest weakness in our philosophical and social science circles, and it is also the biggest obstacle in the current great leap forward.

    编者按：3月13日本报邀请在京的一部分哲学社会科学界人士，举行关于哲学社会科学工作如何实现跃进问题的座谈会。出席的是：潘梓年，于光远，郑振铎，翦伯赞，姜君辰，刘大年，郑昕，戴白韬，孙冶方，周新民，孙定国。他们就这个问题发表了意见。下面是他们的发言记录。
    分工协作，跃进再跃进
    潘梓年
    哲学社会科学事业大跃进的必要性和可能性，现在应当说已不成问题，问题是在如何大跃进。在这里，首先要解决的方向问题现在也应当说大致上已经解决了。我们已经有了远景规划，1958年又有了二十个重点项目。但是，这个规划和这些项目，还不能说已经深入人心，已经成为广大科学家自己的行动纲领。我们的远景规划和重点项目为什么要这样定的道理，要为大家所接受，才能变成物质的力量。因此，我们还要对它们作大力的宣传工作，要到处组织一些座谈会，对远景规划、特别是今年的二十个重点项目，进行广泛的讨论。今天，人民日报开这样的座谈会就是很好的宣传工作。最好各地也能组织这种座谈会，加强这种宣传工作。座谈会应该遵照陆定一同志为“江海学刊”创刊号所写“要做促进派”一文中指出的辨别和正确处理两类矛盾的方向，根据陈伯达同志在科学规划委员会第五次会议上以“厚今薄古、边干边学”为题的讲话的精神，来对远景规划和二十个重点项目展开讨论。一方面希望从各种座谈会收集到对远景规划和重点项目的意见，以便在必要时加以修改，更重要的是能在座谈会上或座谈会以后，大家都能自告奋勇承担规划中特别是重点项目中的研究任务或编写任务。这是目前最迫切的也是很艰巨的组织工作。
    哲学社会科学的队伍，在目前还是不够强大的。但是实际上，力量并不太小，只是散在各地各种工作岗位上，如果能够运用科学规划特别是重点项目作中心把这些力量组织起来，就可以形成一支强大的队伍，就可以使哲学社会科学事业跃进再跃进。组织的形式可以多种多样，不拘一格，如学会、研究会等等都可以用。最好一个地方定出一个地方的科学研究年度计划，一个人定出一个人的科学研究年度计划。彼此定的计划都要能互相配合，分工合作。这里也应该来一个大协作。在经济战线上太原市的大协作和上海支援六省的大协作的作法，很可以、很应当成为我们的好榜样。协作，是我们当前应当特别强调的，因为如不协作，强大的队伍是不可能形成的。而缺乏协作，正是我们哲学社会科学界最大的一个弱点，也是当前大跃进中最大的一个障碍。
