Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 25th: The construction of the 184-kilometer railway line from Hongliuhe on the Xinjiang border to Hami on the Lanxin Railway has recently commenced.

According to the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways' recent Great Leap Forward plan, the track-laying work on the Lanxin Railway will cross Hami by the end of the year, reaching near Qijiaojing, and by the end of next year, it will extend to Karamay.

People of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are extremely encouraged by the rapid westward progress of the Lanxin Railway. After the construction workers entered the site, the Hami Special District immediately mobilized a large amount of grain, meat, and vegetables to send to the site, and guaranteed to supply sufficient materials in the future. In order to support the earthwork project in the Hami construction site, the People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is currently organizing a road construction team of about 2,000 people.

    兰新铁路明年可通到克拉玛依
    据新华社乌鲁木齐25日电兰新铁路从新疆边境红柳河到哈密间长一百八十四公里的线路工程最近动工。
    根据铁道部第一工程局最近的跃进计划，兰新铁路的铺轨工程到年底将越过哈密，可以铺轨到七角井附近，明年年底将铺轨到克拉玛依。
    新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民对兰新铁路的迅速西进极感振奋。筑路工人进入工地后，哈密专区立即调集了大批粮食、肉食和蔬菜，送往工地；并保证今后供应足够的物资。新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会为了支援哈密工地的土石方工程，最近正在组织一支约有两千多人参加的筑路队。
