Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Implements Five Measures
Patients' Medical Expenses Greatly Reduced

(Our Newspaper) News from Beijing: The Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is striving towards the goal of reducing patients' medical expenses by 30%.

To achieve this goal, they first promote advanced therapies and strengthen referrals and consultations to improve efficacy and shorten treatment times. For example, patients with hemorrhoids used to require more than thirty days of hospitalization, but now they can be cured and discharged in just over ten days, saving patients half of their hospitalization costs. Second, they are preparing medicines and processing them themselves, which can reduce the cost of many of the most used medicines by 30% to 40%. Third, without increasing funding or personnel, they have set up fifty simple beds; the hospitalization fee for these beds is 75% lower than that of ordinary beds. Fourth, they are reforming the method of supplying patient meals, implementing a cafeteria system (with food still delivered to patients). Without affecting treatment and nutrition, patients can choose various meals at different prices according to their economic conditions. In the past, the meal cost was a uniform 80 cents per person per day, but now it only costs 58 cents, a reduction of 27%. Fifth, they are eliminating unnecessary laboratory tests, fluoroscopies, and photographs, and rationally using expensive medicines.

After these measures were implemented, the average medical expenses for both outpatients and inpatients in all departments were reduced by an average of 30% compared to last year. The greatest cost reduction was for patients with hemorrhoids and fistulas undergoing hospitalization for hemorrhoidectomy, with costs reduced by 70% compared to last year.

    北京中医院实行五项办法
    病人医药费大大减低
    本报讯　北京市中医医院正在朝着降低病人医药费用30％的指标而努力。
    为实现这一指标，他们首先推广先进疗法，加强转诊和会诊，以提高疗效，缩短疗程。如痔疮病人过去住院治疗需要三十多天，现在有十几天就可以治愈出院了，给病人省掉一半的住院费。第二，自己动手配制药品和进行加工，使用量最多的许多药品的成本都可以下降30％到40％。第三，在不增加经费和人员的条件下，举办五十张简易病床，这种病床住院费要比普通病床低75％。第四，改革病人伙食的供应办法，实行食堂制（菜饭仍是送到病人面前）。在不影响治疗和营养的条件下，病人可根据自己的经济条件选择各种不同价格的饭菜。过去伙食费是每人每日一律八角，现在只花五角八分，减去了27％。第五，取消不必要的化验、透视、照像，合理使用贵重药品。
    这些办法实行以后，门诊病人和住院病人各科平均起来，每人平均要比去年少花30％的医药费用。降低费用最多的是痔瘘科住院治疗痔核的病人，要比去年少花70％的费用。
