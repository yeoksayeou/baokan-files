Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th – Antara News Agency reported that an Indonesian Ministry of Information spokesperson said on the 15th that the impression gained from statements made by representatives of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) countries is that they have adopted an attitude of assisting the Padang rebels.

Regarding this issue, the spokesperson mentioned an Antara News Agency dispatch issued when government troops entered Pekanbaru, which described the people welcoming the government troops. He asked, if the rebels were truly democratic and supported by the people there, would the people welcome the government troops, considered "tyrannical" by some, with such joy? Reporters asked the spokesperson to comment on foreign reports of the rebels establishing a government-in-exile overseas. He replied that this clearly shows that the government's actions against the rebels in Central Sumatra have begun to bear fruit. The rebels are now cornered, so they have to turn their attention to foreign countries. He said that the government will implement its resolute measures according to plan.

On the same day, Rohadi, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, told the press that the government should conduct a thorough investigation to determine which country is airdropping weapons to the rebel groups. If conclusive evidence is already in hand, diplomatic measures should be taken.

According to the "Sunday Star" published on the 15th, American ships have continued to smuggle weapons to the Hussein group through the newly liberated oil city of Dumai on the east coast of Central Sumatra.

The newspaper reported that on January 28, an American ship declared six boxes of weapons "missing" immediately after arriving in Dumai. When the authorities investigated, the captain of the ship lied, saying that the weapons had been unloaded in Manila, but he was unable to produce receipts to prove that the weapons had been unloaded in Manila. Customs had planned to detain the captain, but they released him due to the intervention of the "Wild Bull Committee."

    印度尼西亚政府坚决平定叛乱
    报纸继续揭露美国接济叛军武器
    新华社雅加达16日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚情报部发言人15日说，从东南亚条约组织国家代表所发表的言论得到的印象是，他们已经采取了帮助巴东叛军的态度。
    关于这个问题，发言人提到安塔拉通讯社在政府军队开入北干巴鲁时所发出的一条电讯，这条电讯描述了人民欢迎政府军队的情况。他问道，如果叛军确实是民主的和得到那里人民支持的，人民还会欢欣鼓舞地欢迎被某些人士认为是“暴虐”的政府军队吗？记者请发言人就外国所传叛军在海外建立流亡政府的消息发表意见。他回答说，这明白表明，政府对中苏门答腊的叛军所采取的行动已经开始收到成果。叛军现在已经被逼于绝境，因此他们不得不把他们的注意力转向外国。他说，政府将按着计划执行它的坚决措施。
    同一天，国会外交小组委员会主席罗夏迪对报界说，政府应当进行彻底调查，以查明是哪个国家向叛乱集团空投武器的。如果已经握有确凿证据，就应该采取外交措施。
    据15日出版的“星期日明星报”说，美国船只在过去继续不断地通过中苏门答腊东海岸新近解放的石油城杜迈向侯赛尼集团私运武器。
    这家报纸报道，在1月28日，一艘美国船在抵达杜迈以后立即宣布船上的六箱武器“失踪”。当有关当局进行调查的时候，这个船的船长撒谎说，这些武器已经在马尼拉卸下来了，但是他没有能够拿出收据来证实这些武器已经在马尼拉卸下来。海关曾经计划扣留这个船长，但由于“雄牛师委员会”的干涉，他们把他放走了。
