These three letters forwarded by the People's Daily indicate that our service work for cadres sent to the countryside and mountains is still not sufficient. Some county and city postal and telecommunications bureaus have not kept up with this work quickly enough. We have already notified the postal and telecommunications bureaus of Henan and Shanxi provinces to immediately send people to the places where the comrades who wrote the letters are located, and take practical measures to help solve the existing problems.

In order to cooperate with the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and actively do a good job in serving the cadres sent to the countryside and mountains, we sent a working group before the Spring Festival to Shanxi, Hebei and other provinces to check and understand the work of local post offices in coordinating with the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and the sending of cadres to the countryside and mountains. In February of this year, Comrade Fan Shiren, the Party Secretary of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, gave instructions to the postal and telecommunications bureaus of all provinces (cities) and autonomous regions on how to do a good job in serving the cadres sent to the countryside and mountains at the national telephone conference. Recently, we have also organized the bureaus of all provinces (cities) and autonomous regions to report regularly by telephone. Judging from the reports of several provinces, the work in this area has been improved to varying degrees in various places. For example, Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, Henan and other provinces are all striving to achieve "postal service in every township and commune." Most provinces have also proposed to have a "postal run" to townships every day and to communes every other day. Anhui Province has proposed that letters and newspapers arriving at the county post and telecommunications bureau before 9:00 a.m. should be delivered to the townships and communes on the morning run, and those arriving before 1:00 p.m. should be delivered to the townships and communes on the afternoon run. The Jinhe Branch of the Suihua County Post Office in Heilongjiang has already achieved "every commune can subscribe to newspapers, and every team can buy stamps." Many counties, such as Xuancheng and Jiashan counties in Anhui Province, have opened postal and telecommunications offices in places where there are concentrated numbers of downward transferred cadres. Hebei's Jiahe County has set up eleven mailboxes in places where downward transferred cadres are concentrated. We sincerely hope that comrades who have gone to the countryside and mountains will raise their requests to us or the local county and city post and telecommunications bureaus at any time, to help us further improve our work.

    一定要为下放干部服务好
    人民日报转来的这三封来信，说明我们为下乡上山干部在通信和订阅报刊方面的服务工作，还作得不够，有些县、市邮电局在这方面的工作，还没有很快地跟上去。我们已经通知河南、山西省邮电管理局立即派人到来信同志们所在的地方，切实采取措施，帮助解决存在的问题。
    我们为了配合农业大跃进和积极作好对下乡上山干部的服务工作，在春节以前曾经派出工作组到山西、河北等省检查了解了各地邮局配合农业大跃进和干部下乡上山的工作。并于本年2月间在全国电话会议上由邮电部党组书记范式人同志对作好为下乡上山干部服务工作，向各省（市）自治区邮电管理局作了指示。最近，我们又组织各省（市）自治区局定期用电话汇报，从几个省汇报的情况来看，各地在这方面的工作都有了不同程度的改进。如福建、安徽、湖南、河南等省都要作到“乡乡、社社通邮”，一般的省也都提出要作到逐日有“邮班”到乡，隔日到社。安徽省提出凡是上午九点以前到县邮电局的信件、报纸，要在上午出班投递到各乡、社，下午一点以前到的要在当天下午出班投递到各乡、社。黑龙江绥化县的津河支局已经作到“社社可以代订报，队队可以买邮票”。有很多县，像安徽省宣城、嘉山县在下放干部集中的地方都开设了邮电机构。河北交河县在下放干部集中的地方就设置了十一个信箱。我们诚恳地希望下乡上山的同志们随时把对我们的要求，向我们或当地县、市邮电局提出，帮助我们进一步改进工作。
