Since last autumn, after the socialist education movement in various parts of our country, especially after the great debate centered on the grain issue, the broad masses have greatly improved their understanding of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. In the past six months, the national grain purchase and sales situation has been better than in the same period of the previous year. This is the main aspect. However, not everyone has recognized the consistency between personal and national interests on the grain issue. In addition, some farmers are indeed short of grain, so the grain issue still needs attention. Recently, some places have been shouting about grain shortages, and grain sales have increased significantly, which should all be noted. Now, in many areas, spring plowing has begun. In some areas where ideological work has been done poorly, and where grain purchase and sales work has not been done well, combined with the rural rectification campaign and the great production movement, like Jilin Province, squeezing out a certain amount of time to conduct a remedial lesson of the socialist great debate centered on the grain issue, to further enhance the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses, is still very necessary.

Many facts prove that only a few of those who shout that there is not enough grain to eat are truly short of grain; most of them have not resolved their ideological problems, or there is waste in grain consumption. Therefore, ideological and political work is still the key to solving the grain problem. Henan Province is a good example. The province suffered a relatively severe disaster in 1957, and grain production was lower than in 1956. The grain purchase task was not reduced, but because of continuous ideological education, the purchase task was successfully completed, and sales did not increase. On the contrary, in some places where the harvest was not bad, or even in high-yield areas, the grain purchase task was not completed well and sales exceeded the plan because the ideological problem was not thoroughly resolved.

In cities and industrial and mining areas, the issue of saving grain still needs to be emphasized. Some people always think that grain supply standards in cities have been compressed again and again, and there is nothing more to save. This is not the case. Some collective catering units have many loopholes and waste is still large due to lax management systems and poor supply methods. The Xi'an First Construction Production Cooperative used to give grain to visitors without grain coupons, and temporary workers did not hand in grain coupons, and employees even took steamed buns home after eating. By last November, they had a total deficit of eight thousand catties of grain. After inspection and improvement of the management system, by January, the saved grain had already made up for the past deficit. Recently, they proposed to save another half a catty on the basis of saving one catty of grain per person per month. Because all teachers, students and staff of Xi'an Commercial School paid attention to saving grain, the amount of grain consumption decreased month by month for five consecutive months, from an average of forty-six catties to thirty-five catties per person per month, which was enough to eat. After Northeast People's University implemented the system of quantitative grain supply, there was once a shortage of staple food. At that time, the school implemented a collective catering system, and many students overate, suffering from stomach problems. The school's party and government leaders discovered this problem, held meetings to study it, changed the collective catering to a cafeteria system, students' diets gradually became regular, fewer people got sick, and a lot of grain was saved. Now, each person saves six taels and three liang per month compared to the quota standard.

Advocating saving grain is certainly not to reduce people's living standards, to make people starve; but to compress the part that is indeed wasted, so that people can live well and frugally. Thrift is the fundamental method of socialist construction. Today, when our country's grain output is not large, we need to save; even if grain output is greatly increased, we must also save. Countless facts have also repeatedly proved that the potential for saving is very large. As long as the saving work is done well, and the grain is used appropriately, the existing grain can be enough.

    永远都要节约粮食
    田连阡
    去秋以来，我国各地经过社会主义教育运动，特别是经过以粮食问题为中心的大辩论以后，广大群众对于粮食统购统销政策的认识有了很大的提高。过去半年中，全国粮食征购和销售情况，都比上一年度的同一时期为好。这是主要的方面。但是，在粮食问题上并不是每个人都已经认识了个人利益同国家利益的一致性。加以确实有少数农民缺粮，所以粮食问题仍然是需要注意的问题。最近有的地方又在喊缺粮，有的粮食销量增加很大，都应当引起注意。现在，在很多地区，春耕已经开始了，在一些思想工作做得比较差的地方，粮食购销工作搞得不好的地方，结合农村整风和大生产运动，像吉林省这样，挤出一定时间来一次以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论的补课工作，更进一步提高农民群众的社会主义觉悟，还是非常必要的。
    很多事实证明，叫喊粮食不够吃的人，只有少数是真正缺粮的，大部分是思想问题没有解决，或者用粮有浪费现象。因此，思想政治工作仍是解决粮食问题的关键。河南省就是一个很好的例子。这个省1957年灾情较重，粮食比1956年减产，征购任务并没减少，但由于不断进行思想教育，结果征购任务顺利完成，销售量也没有增加。相反的，有些地方年成不坏，甚至是高额丰产区，但由于思想问题解决得不透，不仅粮食征购任务完成得不好，销售量也突破了计划。
    在城市和工矿区，节约粮食的问题仍然需要强调。有些人总以为城市中粮食供应标准经过一再压缩，再也没有什么可节约的了。实际并不如此。有些集体伙食单位由于管理制度不严，供应方法不好，漏洞很多，浪费仍然很大。西安市第一建筑生产合作社，过去来客不要粮票，临时工也不交粮票，职工用饭后还把馒头带回家。到去年11月，他们共亏空了八千斤粮食。经过检查，改进了管理制度，到1月份，节余的粮食已经弥补了过去的亏空。最近他们又提出在每人每月已经节约一斤粮的基础上，再节约半斤。西安商业学校全体师生员工因为注意节约粮食，连续五个月粮食消费量逐月下降，每人每月平均由四十六斤降到三十五斤，也够吃了。东北人民大学实行粮食定量供应以后，曾经一度发生主粮不足的现象。当时学校实行集体伙食制度，不少学生暴饮暴食，得了胃病。学校党政负责人发现了这个问题，开会研究，把集体伙食改为食堂制，学生饮食逐渐有了规律，生病的人减少了，还节约了大量粮食。现在每人每月比定量标准节约了六斤三两。
    提倡节约粮食当然不是要降低人民生活水平，要人们忍饥挨饿；而是压缩确实属于浪费的部分，使人们生活得又好又省。节约是社会主义建设的根本方法，在我国粮食产量还不多的今天，我们需要节约；就是粮食产量大大增加了，也要节约。无数的事实也已一再证明节约的潜力非常之大。只要节约工作做得好，粮食用得恰当，现有的粮食是可以够用的。
