    This One Area Alone Cannot "Leap Forward"
    Amidst the calls for a Great Leap Forward, some regions, some departments, and some units have simultaneously put forward "personnel addition" plans. Some want 100,000 people, some want 50,000, the scale of the numbers somewhat resembling a "Leap Forward". We say: All things Leap Forward; but this one area alone cannot "Leap Forward".
    Is it necessary to add people if production increases a lot? According to this editor's humble opinion, the relationship between these two things is probably not "inevitable". Please look at the Jinan Coal Mining Bureau. They improved labor organization, and production is expected to increase by 34.2% compared to last year, while the number of personnel has decreased by 10,000.
    In terms of labor, if we want to use the term "Leap Forward," it should be understood as: like the Jinan Coal Mining Bureau, more work is done with fewer people. The method is: mobilize the masses to improve labor productivity and equipment utilization, and improve labor organization.

### 独此一门不能“跃进”

    独此一门不能“跃进”
    跃进声中，有一些地区、一些部门、一些单位同时提出了“添人”计划。有的要十万人，有的要五万人，数字之大，很有点“跃进”的样子。我们说：万般皆跃进；但是独此一门不能“跃进”。
    是不是产量增加多了，就必得添人呢？据编者的管见，这两者之间恐怕不是“必然”的关系。请看济南煤矿管理局吧。他们改善劳动组织，产量要比去年增加34.2％，人员却减少了一万名。
    在劳动方面，如果要用“跃进”这个字眼的话，应该作这样的理解：就是像济南煤矿管理局那样，工作增多，人员减少。办法就是：发动群众来提高劳动生产率和设备利用率，改善劳动组织。
