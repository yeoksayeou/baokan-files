A Beijing Steel Plant with an annual output of 200,000 tons of steel ingots and steel products has started construction in the southwestern suburbs of Beijing. These days, workers are installing large steelmaking furnaces in the newly completed steelmaking workshop, and it is expected that steel production will begin before May 1st this year.

This steel plant is an expansion of the original Beijing Heating Material Factory and is Beijing's first factory specializing in the production of steel ingots and steel products. It has four workshops: steelmaking, steel rolling, shaping, and welded pipe, and can produce steel pipes, square steel, round steel, tool steel, spring steel, and other steel products to supply the needs of Beijing's machinery industry and basic construction. This factory could only produce a small number of radiators in the early days of liberation. After expanding a steelmaking workshop in 1956, it began to produce steel. At the end of last year, they originally planned to produce more than 37,000 tons of steel in 1958. After the expansion is completed, the annual output will leap to 200,000 tons, which is more than five times the original planned number for this year.

The construction speed of the Beijing Steel Plant is very fast. It is planned that the expanded steelmaking equipment can be put into production in about four months.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 25th. The Hubei Iron and Steel Plant broke ground today. This iron and steel plant will be constructed in two phases. After the completion of the first phase of the project, it will be able to produce 150,000 to 180,000 tons of pig iron, 100,000 to 140,000 tons of steel, and 80,000 to 100,000 tons of various steel products annually. The general steel needed by Hubei Province's local industries can be basically satisfied.

The Hubei Iron and Steel Plant is close to iron ore production areas and adjacent to Echeng County, which makes transportation convenient, so non-productive investment in construction can be greatly reduced. According to data from the Wuhan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute, its construction investment is less than that of similar steel plants across the country, and the future product cost will also be relatively low.

    北京湖北兴建两个钢厂
    本报讯　北京西南郊，一座年产二十万吨钢锭和钢材的北京钢厂已经动工。这几天，工人们正在刚落成的炼钢车间里，安装高大的炼钢炉，预计在今年“五一”前，就能开始出钢。
    这座钢厂是在原有的北京市暖气材料厂的基础上扩建的，是北京第一座专门生产钢锭和钢材的工厂。它有炼钢、轧钢、变形、焊管等四个车间，能制成钢管、方钢、圆钢、工具钢、弹簧钢等钢材，供应北京的机械工业和基本建设的需要。这座工厂在解放初期只能生产少量暖气片，到1956年扩建一个炼钢车间后，才开始生产钢材。去年年底，他们原来计划1958年产钢三万七千多吨，扩建完后，年产量将跃进到二十万吨，等于今年原计划数的五倍多。
    北京钢厂的建设速度是很快的，计划只要四个月左右时间，就能使扩建的炼钢设备投入生产。
    据新华社武汉25日电　湖北钢铁厂今天破土兴建。这座钢铁厂分两期建设。第一期工程建成后能年产生铁十五万到十八万吨，钢十万到十四万吨，各种钢材八万到十万吨。湖北省地方工业所需要的一般钢铁，可以基本上得到满足。
    湖北钢铁厂紧靠铁矿石产地，又紧邻鄂城县城，交通便利，因此建设中非生产性投资可以大大减少。据黑色冶金设计院武汉分院资料，它的建设投资比全国同类型钢铁厂都少，将来的产品成本也比较低廉。
