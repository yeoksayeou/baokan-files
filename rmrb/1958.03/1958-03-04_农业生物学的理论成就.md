    Theoretical Achievements of Agricultural Biology
    Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Lysenko

    Editor's Note: The Soviet "Izvestia" published an article by Lysenko, Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, on December 8, 1957, entitled "Theoretical Achievements of Agricultural Biology." The article systematically summarizes the theoretical achievements of Michurin biology over the past forty years, especially elaborating on the unity of theory and practice, i.e., the relationship between biology and agricultural production and medical practice. We are publishing this excerpt for reference by the academic community in our country.

    After the Great October Socialist Revolution, for the first time in history, theoretical biology was able to directly assist agricultural practice. On this basis, agricultural biology emerged in our country. This required not only expanding biological research quantitatively but also transforming it qualitatively, incorporating it into the only correct materialist path. Our scholars have ample opportunity to guide their scientific research with the indispensable methods of scientific analysis and synthesis—dialectical materialism, the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism.

    If we talk about the main summary of the forty-year history of theoretical biology in our country, a summary that is reflected in her extremely diverse achievements, then this summary is the flourishing of Michurin's doctrine, which plays a decisive role in the achievements of all aspects of agricultural biological research.

    The materialist direction of Michurin's biological doctrine is attracting progressive natural scientists in our country and abroad. Michurin's doctrine is loved, valued, and developed by millions of agricultural workers. Conversely, conservatives, whether or not they are biologists, are not friends of Michurin's doctrine. They consider Michurin's doctrine not to be science, considering Michurin to be a "pure practitioner" with nothing in common with science, a "gardener."

    Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the working people, noticed Michurin's activities in the early years after the October Revolution and showed great concern for him. Lenin discovered Michurin and Michurin's doctrine for the people and for science. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have created all the necessary conditions for the effective development of the Michurin biological direction, both in the past and now.

    The principles of Michurin's doctrine are of particular importance for practice. For example, understanding whether it is possible to control the heredity of crops and livestock is very important for practice. Is it possible to change heredity in the direction required by practice? "Classical genetics," or Weismann genetics, answers this question with: It is impossible to obtain directed variations in the heredity of organisms. Michurin and his successors, based on a materialist understanding of the organic world, believe that as long as we discover the laws of biology and rely on these laws to formulate methods for obtaining such variations, directed variations in heredity can be obtained.

    The laws of biological survival and development discovered by Michurin's doctrine make it possible to explore and further formulate different methods (agricultural technology, animal husbandry, and laboratory methods) for obtaining directed variations in organic types.

    The inseparable connection between an organic type and its living conditions is easy to see. The dependence of an organism's body on external environmental conditions cannot be denied by anyone, including representatives of "classical genetics." However, in the view of opponents of Michurin's genetics, the body, i.e., the organism's physical form, does not have hereditary characteristics; only some special genetic material has heredity, and this genetic material, whether called "genes" or "chromosome loci" or "deoxyribonucleic acid" molecules, controls the body, while the physiology of the organism's body cannot affect this genetic material.

    Therefore, in their view, the effort of the Michurin biological direction to increasingly control the heredity of animals and plants and to obtain directed variations in heredity by changing assimilation and dissimilation processes is unrealistic.

    The facts of directed variations in the heredity of animals and plants have accumulated so much in our country that it is almost impossible to find people among the opponents of Michurin's doctrine in our country who firmly deny these facts. They are silent about these facts. Opponents of the Michurin biological direction abroad behave differently. Some, such as Swedish scholar Professor Gustafsson, simply state that the facts of spring wheat turning into winter wheat, the facts of asexual hybridization, and the facts of obtaining some biological species from other biological species, such as obtaining rye from wheat, are all deceptive.

    From their standpoint, the basis for these scholars lies solely in the fact that these phenomena are impossible because they contradict all the ideas of "classical genetics."

    In recent years, representatives of "classical genetics" have often said that it seems that only from their standpoint can the heterosis of corn, which is widely used in practice, be explained. But this is far from the case. Even Leach, a supporter of "classical genetics," agrees with this view. He wrote in "Corn Selection": "The honor of the first suggestion to use the hybridization of inbred lines as a method to obtain high-yielding hybrids should belong to Shull.

    Shull correctly explained the phenomenon of heterosis. This explanation, as the representatives of "classical genetics" themselves say, is not Mendelian but Darwinian. Naturally, the Michurin biological direction, which has developed Darwinism, has revealed the essence of heterosis and the phenomenon of increasing the vitality of animal and plant organisms far more deeply than Darwin did at the time.

    In Michurin's biological doctrine, vitality is the result of the contradiction of living bodies. The degree of contradiction, that is, the degree of vitality of living bodies, depends on the degree of heterogeneity (within a certain range). Starting from this point, various methods of studying and improving the vitality of animal and plant organisms have been studied and are being studied. For example, Professor Kvaritsky, Academician Avakyan, Academician Milovanov, etc., have been studying and are studying new methods that can obtain inbred (self-crossed) corn offspring that do not degenerate or degenerate less.

    Here, it is necessary to point out some biological laws that have been determined by Michurin's doctrine and have great practical and theoretical significance.

    Experiments have proved that heredity is not a special substance outside the living body, as "classical genetics" asserts, but a characteristic of the living body itself. Therefore, it is aimless to look for special genetic material and genetic organs in living bodies. If it is said that there are carriers of the above-mentioned heredity, then such carriers can be any part or any substance of the living body under certain conditions, including ordinary plant sap and the plastic substances used by plants to build their bodies.

    Now everyone knows that the facts of obtaining asexual hybrids, intraspecific asexual hybrids of two animal or plant varieties, are in many ways similar to hybrids obtained by sexual means. Intraspecific asexual hybrids can now be easily obtained not only in plants and microorganisms but also in animals (such as birds) by asexual means. These hybrids have been and still are insurmountable difficulties for the supporters of mechanism and idealism in science. Mechanists and idealists believe that heredity is not a characteristic of the living body but a special substance located in the living body and controlling the development of the living body.

    Experiments have proved that changes in heredity are only possible in the processes of assimilation and dissimilation, that is, in the processes of building and transforming the living body. New methods of weakening the conservatism of heredity have been found and are being created to change the processes of assimilation and dissimilation, and thus to change heredity.

    Experiments have proved that changes in heredity are adapted to the influence of external environmental conditions.

    The change in heredity adapted to external environmental conditions lies in the fact that the organism, the living body, produces new requirements in the process of assimilation, and this requirement is contained within the living body and is used by it to initially transform into the conditions of that living body. The law of adaptive variation of heredity under the influence of external environmental conditions lies in this.

    It is necessary to distinguish between those hereditary characteristics that manifest themselves as the requirements of the living body for certain external environmental conditions and the hereditary adaptability of the organism to tolerate the effects of external environmental conditions that are not required for its life and development relatively harmlessly in order to survive under certain environmental conditions. Whether the former characteristic or the latter characteristic occurs in the process of the living body assimilating external environmental conditions. However, hereditary requirements are the result of the law, according to which the living body adapts and changes to the effects of external environmental conditions. The adaptation of the heredity of the living body to the environment in which it lives is not only not what it needs but also what it prevents. This adaptability is the result of the law of adaptive variability and also the result of the regular (not accidental) interrelationships of different external environmental conditions acting on the living body. The latter adaptability is the premise of the so-called rational structure of individual organisms and the entire organic world.

    As everyone knows, organisms that artificially induce hereditary variations (mutations) with different chemical and physical factors are usually less adapted or rarely adapted to life compared to ordinary organisms whose heredity has not changed. We explain this as follows: In these cases, the new hereditary characteristics are the result of accidental external factors and the irregular interrelationship with all other living conditions of the organism.

    Many cases of experimental transformation of spring wheat into winter wheat, that is, cases of non-overwintering types turning into overwintering types, can clearly show the influence of the adaptive law of hereditary variation and the law of the occurrence of hereditary adaptability of organisms on their living environment. These achievements in Michurin biology are not only of great significance to agricultural practice, but they also block the way for various mysterious and idealistic explanations of the most important biological phenomena, such as the rationality of organism structure and the rationality of its organs and functions, from infiltrating science.

    The concept of initial rationality is based on the undoubtedly correct facts that any physiological process is usually adapted to the requirements of the general type of development of the biological species. This incorrect concept has always been the basis of various forms of idealism in biology.

    Only Michurin's doctrine reveals the essence of these common facts of biology. These facts used to serve idealism, but now, due to the discovery of Michurin's doctrine, they consolidate materialism in biology and serve the needs of practice.

    Based on the materialist components in Darwin's doctrine, while deepening and transforming them, Michurin's biological doctrine found that all biological species—a certain link in the quality of the organic world—survive and develop according to the unified law of species survival.

    The essence of the law of biological species survival has been revealed, that is, the direction of the life process lies in: not the expansion of the general number of living bodies, but the expansion of the number of that specific species. Therefore, the normal, non-morbid body of the living body, all its structure and state, all its characteristics and processes, all its diverse requirements for living conditions, and the diversity of reactions to external environmental conditions that it does not need and are alien to it, all this, in one way or another, leads to the increase in the number of that specific biological species, even though it shortens the life of that specific individual, or even causes its natural death.

    The consideration of the law of species survival and its action in the specific survival situation of a certain organic type opens up broad prospects in the work of controlling heredity formation. For example, it is precisely based on the consideration of this law of species survival that the problem of cultivating herds of dairy cows with high milk fat content has been successfully solved in practice in our country. Now it is clear that no biological department can ignore the law of species survival without bringing losses to theory and practice.

    Darwin, who first placed biology on a scientific basis, gave a materialist explanation of so-called biological rationality. However, because the specific causes of biological variation were not clear at the time, according to Darwin's explanation of his indefinite variation, hereditary variation naturally occurred as if by chance.

    Thus, Darwin's understanding of the basis of the development of the organic world is chance, not objective necessity, not the biological law of hereditary variation.

    After discovering the biological law of heredity and its variation, Michurin's doctrine pointed out that the basis of the development of the organic world is not the spark of chance but the necessity laid down in history is the law of the development of the organic world. It is understandable that this does not deny the countless contingencies that always occur in the development process of any living body. On the contrary, only from the standpoint of the developing Michurin's doctrine can one understand that the development of the living body is the transition from contingency to necessity, to heredity, which is its law of formation.

    It should be known that the effect of new types of conditions on a certain type of living body is accidental to that living body. But if this type of new accidental external environmental conditions acting on the living body is assimilated by the living body, if the living body is built with these conditions or under the influence of these conditions, then this living body will be in another situation. Biologically, it will be different from its old heredity and will have new, certain assimilation and dissimilation effects and requirements for new, certain external environmental conditions. These certain conditions are the conditions that were assimilated by the original way that the original accidental effects acted on the original living body. In this way, the transformation of contingency to necessity, to heredity, is realized in the organic world.

    In order to create plastic organisms, to make them easily accept and assimilate external environmental conditions that are not inherent in their nature, to assimilate the conditions that are easily transformed into living bodies with the required characteristics and qualities, it is necessary to destroy some of the hereditary conservatism and physiological complexity of the organisms. Previously, in higher plants, the method of weakening the hereditary conservatism of spring and winter characteristics of grain crops has been best studied. On this basis, winter grain crops can be turned into spring crops, and spring crops can be turned into winter crops.

    Therefore, the knowledge of the regular transformation of spring grain crops into winter crops and winter crops into spring crops and its further determination, from our point of view, is extremely important not only for biologists engaged in the study of grain crops but also for biologists engaged in the study of other crops.

    From the above, it can be concluded that the developing Michurin's biological doctrine believes that the basis of the development of the organic world is not chance, as Darwin was forced to say, but necessity, the law of transforming lifeless natural conditions into food for living bodies, and at the same time into living bodies themselves. After recognizing this law, Michurin's biological doctrine transformed Darwinism into creative Darwinism, into an effective theoretical basis for agronomy and medical biology.

    It is wrong for some scientific workers to divide biological science into Michurin and non-Michurin according to what materials are used for research and what factors affect biology. Such an opinion is widely circulated among biologists in our country and abroad: If an experimenter uses radiation energy or chemical substances to act on animals, plants, or microorganisms, then he puts himself in the ranks of opponents of Michurin's doctrine. If an experimenter uses agricultural technology or animal husbandry methods to act on biology, it is considered that he is a Michurin worker. This is, of course, very clumsy and incorrect.

    The enemies of scientific progress strive to prove that it seems that Michurin's doctrine cannot be applied to various physical and chemical factors and inbreeding of animals and plants in principle. However, it is precisely from the standpoint of Michurin's doctrine, and according to the biological laws explained by this doctrine, that it is possible to rationally and to the greatest benefit of practice apply different physical and chemical substances to living objects, and it is also possible to use inbreeding of animals and plants.

    It should be known that only Michurin's doctrine can materially and correctly explain the occurrence of mutations, that is, hereditary changes caused by the results of so-called mutagenic factors. These hereditary changes are not produced by the radiation factors that cause mutations themselves. These effects can only destroy physiological complexity, but occur in the subsequent metabolic processes, in the subsequent assimilation and dissimilation processes. This concept enables experimenters to formulate methods for obtaining directed genetic variations when applying so-called mutagenic factors.

    In short, it is unscientific to divide staff and biological sciences into different camps according to the factors acting on the living objects. If this is the case, it will confuse the attitude towards biological phenomena and its explanation and the ways and methods of influencing biological objects. The latter, that is, the method of action, should not be so rigid, but should be determined according to the place, time, and conditions. The laws of nature are eternal. According to these laws, certain agricultural techniques and animal husbandry techniques and laboratory methods can and need to be adopted in different situations.

    The dividing line between materialism and idealism in biology is the method and attitude of treating the study of biological phenomena and understanding and explaining these phenomena. The philosophy of Michurin biologists is dialectical materialism, and the philosophy of opponents of Michurin's doctrine can be any kind, but not a thorough materialist philosophy.

    In order not to deviate from the path of materialism, Michurin biologists, when solving theoretical problems, consistently proceed from the interests of practice and the requirements of practice, and strive to create the possibility of solving important problems in practice. This is the unity of theory and practice. Without this unity, the research of theoretical biology will lose objectivity and purpose orientation, and the researcher will fall into the quagmire of idealism and sophistry. This sophistry will confuse the theoretical problems that have been clarified, and it will hinder our further effective research and the road to understanding the truth.

    The magazine and other publications edited by Academician Sukachev can be used as examples to well confirm the correctness of the conclusions made here. In the "Botanical Journal" and "Bulletin of the Moscow Society of Naturalists" that he edited and published, he started an extremely unscientific criticism of my work and scientific workers who agreed with my work under the title of seemingly materialist biology, until he directly denied all concepts of materialist biology. Now they still deny any characteristics of biological regularity.

    All this is an attempt to withdraw biological science from the path of materialism. Under the conditions of our country, this attempt will certainly not achieve any success. However, they hinder the development of science and blur the minds of some young biologists, especially young students. These people will not be able to be very heavy in their practical lives. Life practice will force them to be re-educated.

    We are all very clear that agronomy and medical biology—that is, general biological science—cannot successfully develop without debate and without debates of different opinions. However, the debate of opinions only in publications and in classrooms, without field and farm, experiment and practice inspection, usually will not be of any benefit. Comrade Khrushchev is completely right about this issue:

    "I think that theoretical and scientific debates should be resolved in the field. Let a scholar say: Comrade, your method is not good, mine is better, it is based on science. Then give a certain number of hectares of land to sow according to your method, and the same land to sow according to my method, and the referees will be the collective farms and collective farmers."

    Therefore, agricultural biologists should more closely consolidate the unity of theoretical biology with the practice of collective farms and state farms, and medical biologists should consolidate the unity of theoretical biology with medical practice.

    The Party and the government have created all the necessary conditions in our country in the past and now in order to further develop science. It can be believed that the future materialist biology in our country will be more brilliant and more fruitful than her brilliant past.

    农业生物学的理论成就
    苏联科学院院士　李森科
    编者按：苏联“消息报”1957年12月8日发表了苏联科学院院士李森科的“农业生物学的理论成就”一文。文中系统地总结了米丘林生物学四十年来的理论成就，特别是对理论同实践的统一问题，即生物学同农业生产和医学实践的关系问题作了论证。这里特摘译发表，以供我国学术界参考。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，理论生物学在历史上第一次能够给农业实践以直接帮助。在这个基础上，在我国就产生了农业生物学。为此，不仅必须从数量上扩大生物学的研究工作，而且必须从质量上改造这些工作，使之纳入唯一正确的唯物主义途径。我国学者们有充分的可能用不可缺少的科学分析和科学综合的方法——辩证唯物主义、马克思列宁主义哲学来指导自己的科学研究。
    如果谈到我国理论生物学四十年历史的主要总结，表现在她的极为多样的成就当中的这样的总结，那么这种总结也就是对农业生物学研究的各个方面的成就起决定作用的米丘林学说的繁荣。
    米丘林生物学说的唯物主义方向正在吸引着我国和外国的进步的自然科学家。米丘林学说为千百万的农业工作者所热爱、重视、发展。相反地，保守主义者，无论他是不是生物学家，都不是米丘林学说的朋友。他们认为米丘林学说不是科学，认为米丘林是同科学没有任何共同之处的“纯粹的实践家”，是“园丁”。
    劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师列宁在十月革命后的最初年代里注意到了米丘林的活动，对他表示了巨大的关怀。列宁为人民、为科学发现了米丘林和米丘林学说。苏联共产党和苏联政府，为了有成效地发展米丘林生物学方向，过去和现在都为它创造了一切必需的条件。
    米丘林学说的原理对于实践具有特别重要的意义。例如了解能否控制农作物和农畜的遗传性，对于实践很为重要。是否可以把遗传性向着实践所需要的方向改变呢？“古典遗传学”即魏司曼遗传学对这个问题的回答是：不可能获得有机体遗传性的定向变异。米丘林和他的继承者，根据对有机界的唯物主义的理解，认定只要发掘生物学的规律，依靠这些规律制定获得这类变异的方法，遗传性的定向变异是能够获得的。
    米丘林学说所发现的生物生存和发展的规律，使有可能探讨并进一步制定不同的（农业技术、畜牧以及实验室的）获得有机体类型定向变异的方法。
    有机类型和它的生活条件的不可分割的联系是很容易看到的。有机体身体对于外界环境条件的依存性，任何人，包括“古典遗传学”的代表在内，都不能否认。但是，在米丘林遗传学说反对者看来，身体，即有机体的躯体不具有遗传特性；仅仅某种特殊的遗传物质才具有遗传性，这种遗传物质，不管称它为“基因”或者“染色体的基因座”或者“去氧核糖核酸”的分子控制着身体，而有机体身体的生理不能影响这种遗传物质。
    因此，在他们看来，米丘林生物学方向力图愈来愈多地控制动植物遗传性，用改变同化和异化过程的方法获得遗传性的定向变异，是不现实的。
    动植物遗传性定向变异的事实在我国已经累积得这样多，以致在我国的米丘林学说的反对者当中几乎找不到坚决否认这些事实的人。他们对这些事实表示沉默。国外的米丘林生物学方向的反对者表现得不同些。有的，如瑞典学者古斯塔夫逊教授干脆声称：春麦变冬麦的事实，无性杂交的事实，以及从一些生物种中获得另外一些生物种的事实，如从小麦中得到黑麦等等，这些都是欺人之谈。
    这些学者的根据，从他们的立场看来，仅仅在于，这些现象是不可能的，因为这些现象同“古典遗传学”的全部观念是矛盾的。
    近年来，“古典遗传学”的代表们常常说，好像只有从他们的立场上，才能解释实践中普遍应用的玉米杂种优势。但事实上远远不是这样。就是“古典遗传学”的拥护者李奇也同意这样的看法。他在“玉米选种”一文中写道：“第一个建议用近亲繁殖系植物杂交作为获得高产杂种方法的荣誉应该属于沙尔。
    沙尔正确地解释了杂种优势现象。这种解释，正如“古典遗传学”的代表者们自己所说的，不是孟德尔主义，而是达尔文主义的。自然，发展了达尔文主义的米丘林生物学方向，对杂种优势和提高动植物有机体生活力现象的本质的揭露，远较达尔文当时更为深刻。
    在米丘林生物学说中，生活力是活体矛盾的结果。矛盾的程度，即活体生活力的程度，依异质性的程度
  （在一定范围内）而定。以此为出发点，过去和现在都在研究、提高动植物有机体生活力的各种方法。例如，克瓦尔斯基教授、阿瓦克扬院士、米洛凡纳夫院士等，他们过去和现在都在研究能够获得不退化的或者少退化的玉米近亲繁殖（自交）后代的新方法。
    这里要指出一些已经被米丘林学说所确定的具有巨大实践和理论意义的生物学规律。
    试验证明，遗传性不是像“古典遗传学”所断言的那样是活体以外的特殊物质，而是活体本身的特性。因此，在活体中去找特殊的遗传物质、遗传器官是无目的的。假如说是上述的遗传性的携带者，那么这种携带者在一定情况下可以是任何一部分或者任何活体的物质，其中包括普通的植物汁液、植物用以建造自己身体的可塑性物质。
    现在大家都知道，获得无性杂种、两个动物或者植物品种的种内无性杂种的事实，很多方面同用有性方式所得到的杂种相似。种内无性杂种，现在不仅很容易在植物和微生物中得到，而且也能够在动物中（如鸟类）用无性方式得到。这些杂种曾经是、现在仍然是科学中的机械主义和唯心主义拥护者不可克服的困难。机械主义和唯心主义者认为遗传性不是活体的特性，而是位于活体中并且控制着活体发育的某种特殊的物质。
    试验证明，遗传性的改变只有在同化和异化过程中，也就是在活体建造和改造的过程中才有可能。已经找到并且正在创造削弱遗传性的保守性的新方法，以改变同化和异化过程，并从而改变遗传性。
    试验证明，遗传性的改变同外界环境条件的影响相适应。
    同外界环境条件相适应的遗传性的改变在于有机体、活体在同化过程中产生了新的要求，这种要求就是活体内部蕴藏的，并且借助于它最初转变为该活体的条件。外界环境条件影响下的遗传性的适应变异的规律即在于此。
    必须把那些表现为活体要求某种外界环境条件的遗传特性，同有机体为了在一定环境条件下生存相对无害地忍受该有机体生活和发育所不要求的外界环境条件的作用的遗传适应性区别开来。无论前一特性或者后一特性，都是发生在活体同化外界环境条件过程中的遗传性。但是，遗传上的要求是规律作用的结果，根据这一规律，活体适应着外界环境条件的作用而改变。活体遗传性对于它所生存的环境的适应性，不仅不是它需要的，而且是它所防范的。这种适应性是适应变异性规律的结果，也是作用于该活体的不同外界环境条件的有规律的（不是偶然的）相互联系的结果。后一种适应性是个别有机体和整个有机界所谓合理结构的前提。
    大家知道，用不同的化学的和物理的因素，人工引起遗传性变异（突变）的有机体，同普通遗传性没有发生变异的有机体比较起来，照例是对生活不适应或者很少适应的。我们是这样解释的：在这些情况下，新的遗传特性是由于偶然的以及同该有机体的所有其他生活条件没有规律的相互关系的外界因素作用的结果。
    遗传上春麦实验转变为遗传上冬麦的许多事例，也就是遗传上不越冬类型转变为遗传上越冬类型的事例，可以明显地表明遗传性变异的适应性规律和有机体遗传上适应性发生的规律对其生存环境的影响。这些成就在米丘林生物学中，不只对农业实践具有巨大意义，它们还堵塞了那些对最重要的生物学现象，例如有机体结构的合理性、其器官和机能的合理性所作的各种神秘的唯心主义解释渗入到科学中去的后路。
    关于最初合理性的观念，是以任何生理过程通常是和该生物种发展的一般类型的要求相适应的这些无庸置疑的正确事实为基础的。这种不正确的观念，过去和现在永远都是生物学中各种变相唯心论的基础。
    只有米丘林学说揭露了生物的这些共同事实的实质。这些事实过去为唯心论服务，而现在由于米丘林学说的发现，巩固了生物学中的唯物主义，同时为实践的需要服务。
    基于达尔文学说中的唯物主义成分，在加深并且改造它们的同时，米丘林生物学说发现一切生物种——有机界质上的一定环节——是按照物种生存的统一规律生存着、发展着的。
    生物种生存规律的本质已经被揭发出来，即生命过程的定向性在于：不是一般的活体数量的扩大，而是该具体物种的数量的扩大。因而，正常的、非病态的活体身体，它的一切结构和状态，一切特性和过程，一切对生活条件的多种多样的要求，以及对它所不需要的、异己的外界环境条件反应的多样性，所有这一切，这样的或者那样的都导使该具体生物种数量的增加，尽管这样缩短了该具体个体的生命，甚至使它自然死亡。
    物种的生存规律和它在一定有机类型具体生存情况下作用的考虑，在控制遗传性形成的工作中开辟了广阔的前景。例如，正是根据这一物种生存规律的考虑，在我国实践上成功地解决了培殖乳脂率高的乳牛群的问题。现在很清楚，没有一个生物学部门，忽视物种的生存规律而不给理论和实践带来损失。
    第一个把生物学置于科学基础之上的达尔文给予所谓生物合理性以唯物主义的解释。但是，因为当时生物变异的具体原因还不清楚，按照达尔文在他的不定变异的解释中，遗传变异性，自然是像偶然性一样发生的。
    这样，达尔文对理解有机界发展的基础是偶然性，而不是客观的必然性，不是遗传性变异的生物学规律。
    米丘林学说在发现了遗传性和它的变异性的生物学规律以后指出，有机界发展的基础不是偶然性的火花，而是历史上奠定的必然性是有机界发展的规律。可以理解，这并不否定永远发生于任何活体发育过程中的无数偶然性。相反地，只有从发展中的米丘林学说的立场上才能够了解活体的发展是从偶然性过渡到必然性，过渡到遗传性，这就是它的形成规律。
    要知道，新型条件对一定活体类型的作用，对该活体来说是偶然的。但是如果这类作用于活体的新的偶然的外界环境条件，被活体所同化，如果用这些条件，或者在这些条件的影响之下活体被建造，那么这一活体将是另一种情况。生物学上它将有别于它的旧的遗传性，将具有新的、一定的同化和异化作用与对新的一定外界环境条件的要求。这些一定的条件即由最初偶然作用于原始生物的方式被同化的条件而变成。这样，在有机界实现着偶然性到必然性，到遗传性的转变。
    为了创造可塑性的有机体，使它容易接受、同化它们本性所不具有的外界环境条件，同化那些容易转变为具有需要特性和品质的活体的条件，必须破坏有机体某些遗传性的保守性和生理上的复杂性。以前在高等植物方面，能够削弱谷类作物春性和冬性遗传保守性的方法研究得最好，在这个基础上，可以把冬性谷类作物变为春性，以及春性变为冬性。
    因此，揭露春性谷类作物变为冬性以及冬性变为春性的规律性转变的知识和它进一步的确定，从我们的观点看来，不只对从事研究谷类作物的生物学家，而且对研究其他作物的生物学家都是极重要的。
    由上所述得出结论：发展中的米丘林生物学说认为，有机界发展的基础，不是达尔文被迫所说的偶然性，而是必然性，是转变无生命的自然条件为活体食物，同时又变为活体本身的规律。承认这一规律以后，米丘林生物学说把达尔文主义转变为创造性的达尔文主义，变为农学和医学生物学的有效的理论基础。
    有些科学工作者按照用什么材料进行研究，用什么因素影响生物而把生物科学分为米丘林的和非米丘林的，这是不对的。无论我国或者外国的生物学家中都广泛地流传着这样一种意见：如果实验者用辐射能或化学物质作用于动物、植物或微生物，这样他就把自己放在米丘林学说反对者的行列中。如果实验者用农业技术、用畜牧方法作用于生物，人们就认为他是米丘林工作者。这当然是十分粗笨的，也是不正确的看法。
    科学进步的敌人，力求证明好像米丘林学说原则上是不能应用各种物理化学因素以及动植物近亲繁殖的。然而，正是从米丘林学说的立场，根据这一学说所阐明的生物学规律，可以合理地、对实践有最大利益地应用不同的物理化学物质作用于活的对象，也可以用动植物的近亲繁殖。
    要知道，只有米丘林学说能够唯物主义地、正确地解释突变的出现，也就是用所谓诱变因素作用结果的遗传性的改变。这些遗传性的改变不是由引起突变的辐射因素作用本身产生的，这些作用只能破坏生理的复杂性，而是在以后的代谢过程中，在以后的同化和异化过程中发生的。这个观念使实验家能够在应用所谓突变原因素时制定获得定向遗传变异的方法。
    总之，按照用对活的对象作用的因素而把工作人员和生物科学分为不同的阵营，是不科学的。如果这样区分，就会把对生物现象的态度和它的解释以及影响生物对象的方式、方法混淆起来。后者，也就是作用的方法，不应该这样死板，而应该根据地点、时间和条件来决定。自然的规律是永恒的，根据这些规律在不同情况下可以并且需要采用某种农业技术和畜牧技术以及实验室的方式、方法。
    生物学中唯物主义和唯心主义之间的分界线是对待研究生物现象以及了解和解释这些现象的方法和态度。米丘林生物学家的哲学是辩证唯物主义，而米丘林学说反对者的哲学可以是随便那一种，却不是彻底的唯物主义哲学。
    为了不至于离开唯物主义的道路，米丘林生物学家在解决理论问题时，始终一贯地从实践的利益、从实践的要求出发，努力创造解决实践中的重要问题的可能性。这方面就是理论和实践的统一。没有这种统一，理论生物学的研究就失去客观性和目的方向性，而研究者也就滚入唯心主义泥坑和烦琐哲学中去。这种烦琐哲学会把已经明确了的理论问题搞得混乱起来，它阻碍我们进一步有效的研究以及认识真理的道路。
    苏卡切夫院士所主编的杂志和其他出版物可以作这样的例子，它曾经很好地证实这里所作的结论的正确性。在他所主编出版的“植物学杂志”和“莫斯科自然实验者协会会刊”里，用好像是唯物主义生物学的标题开始了对我的工作以及同意我的工作的科学工作者以极端脱离科学的批评，直到直接否定一切唯物主义生物学的观念。现在他们仍否认生物学规律性的任何特征。
    所有这一切，都是企图使生物科学从唯物主义道路上撤退。在我国的条件下，这种企图当然不会有什么成就。但是，它们阻碍科学的发展，模糊某些青年生物学家，特别是青年学生的头脑。这些人在他们的实际生活中不能不是很沉重的。生活实践将迫使他们再受教育。
    我们都很清楚，农学和医学生物学——即一般生物科学——离开争论，离开不同意见的争论就不能成功地发展。但是，意见的争论只在出版物上和教室中，没有田间和农场、实验和实践的检查，通常是不会有任何益处的。赫鲁晓夫同志对这一问题说得完全正确：
    “我认为，理论和科学的争论，应该在田间解决。让某个学者说：同志，你的方法不行，我的更好，它是有科学根据的。那么给多少公顷土地按照你的方法播种，同样的土地按照我的方法播种，而裁判员将是集体农庄、集体农民。”
    因此，农业生物学家应该更紧密地巩固理论生物学同集体农庄和国营农场实践的统一，医学生物学家应该巩固理论生物学同医学实践的统一。
    党和政府为了更大地发展科学，过去和现在都在我国创造了一切必要的条件。可以相信，未来的我国唯物主义生物学，较之她光辉的过去，将更光辉，更有成果。
