According to American news agencies, the United States Air Force is airlifting "Matador" missiles from Taiwan to Bangkok, Thailand, in preparation for a public exhibition on March 27, Thailand's Royal Air Force Day. It is already extremely impolite in international diplomacy for the United States to exhibit its weapons in Thailand on a Thai holiday. But the problem doesn't stop there. The United States wants to take this opportunity to exhibit its missiles in Thailand, obviously to flaunt America's "deterrent power," frighten the Thai people, and attempt to force Thailand to allow the United States to establish missile bases.

The United States' long-planned scheme is to turn Thailand into its atomic base in Southeast Asia. At the Manila meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in mid-March, the United States put pressure on Thailand, but it did not achieve its goal. Due to the strong pressure of Asian public opinion and the concerns of some member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the issue of establishing American missile bases in Southeast Asia was not written into the Manila meeting's communique. But the United States has not given up. This time, the United States wants to exhibit missiles in Thailand, which is a continuation of this conspiracy.

This conspiracy activity of the United States has long aroused strong opposition from the Thai people. Around the Manila meeting, many Thai politicians and public opinion figures have expressed their firm opposition to the United States establishing any type of rocket weapons base on Thai soil, because this practice is completely incompatible with Thailand's peace and security interests. Nai Rong Yamsiri, a member of the Thai National Socialist Party, said that establishing missile bases in Thailand has no meaning other than bringing the country to ruin. Nai Dep Chotnuchit, chairman of the Thai Socialist United Front, also pointed out that establishing missile bases in Thailand would only worsen the international situation. Therefore, all Thai people who truly care about the fate of their motherland and world peace are resolutely opposing the United States' nuclear weapons arms race. Many Thai opinions also indicate that the Thai people do not need war, but hope to live in friendship with the people of all countries.

The United States' missile exhibition will not frighten anyone. Currently, a powerful movement against the American nuclear weapons arms race has been launched in Asia and around the world. The Thai people's struggle against the United States establishing missile bases is not isolated. All peace-loving countries and people are very sympathetic to Thailand's situation and will fight together against the United States' nuclear weapons arms race.

    吓唬人的展览
    据美国通讯社报道，美国空军正从台湾空运“斗牛士”式导弹前往泰国的曼谷，准备在3月27日泰国的皇家空军节这一天举行公开展览。美国在泰国的节日，展览它的武器，这在国际外交上讲，已经是十分不礼貌的事情了。可是问题还不仅如此，美国所以要乘此机会到泰国展览它的导弹，显然是想炫耀美国的“威慑力量”，吓唬泰国人民，企图强迫泰国允许美国建立导弹基地。
    美国想把泰国变为它在东南亚的原子基地，这是蓄谋已久的计划。在3月中旬召开的东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议上，美国就曾经对泰国施加压力，不过没有达到目的。由于亚洲舆论的强大压力，加上东南亚条约组织某些成员国的疑虑，关于在东南亚建立美国导弹基地的问题，没有写在马尼拉会议的公报上。但是美国仍然没有死心，这次美国要到泰国展览导弹，就是这种阴谋活动的继续。
    美国的这种阴谋活动，早就引起泰国人民的强烈反对。在马尼拉会议前后，泰国许多政界人士和社会舆论纷纷表示坚决反对美国在泰国的土地上建立任何类型的火箭武器的基地，因为这种做法是同泰国的和平与安全利益完全不相容。泰国国家社会党议员乃荣·炎是拉就说过：在泰国建立导弹基地，除了会使国家归于毁灭之外没有任何意义。泰国社会主义联合阵线主席乃贴·触的努七并曾指出，在泰国建立导弹基地只会使国际局势更加恶化。因此，一切真正关心祖国命运和世界和平的泰国人士，都正在坚决反对美国的核武器备战活动。许多泰国舆论并且表示，泰国人民不需要战争，而希望同各国人民友好相处。
    美国的导弹展览是吓唬不了什么人的。目前，在亚洲和全世界各地，已经展开了反对美国核武器备战的强大运动。泰国人民反对美国建立导弹基地的斗争并不是孤立的。一切爱好和平的国家和人民都十分同情泰国的处境，并将为反对美国的核武器备战而共同斗争。
