    Expanding the Gas Supply Network
    In a few more years, when you open a map of the Soviet Union, you will see it covered with crisscrossing black lines like railway lines, which is the gas supply network. In the next seven years, the Soviet Union will build 40,000 kilometers of gas pipelines, laying the foundation for the nationwide gas supply system. Before 1960, this system will include ten republics.
    For a housewife, the most troublesome thing is dealing with a black coal stove every day. It is not only troublesome, but the coal smoke makes the house very dirty. Now many Soviet housewives have gotten rid of this trouble, and they are using gas. Gas is convenient and cheap. Residents of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev alone can save 350 million rubles a year by using natural gas.
    Of course, the use of gas is not limited to this. When you go to the store to buy clothes, socks, leather bags, and other daily necessities, do you ever think that many of them are made from natural gas as a raw material? The manufacture of car tops, records, and plastic stationery also owes a debt to natural gas. Hundreds of things, such as alcohol and acetic acid, can be obtained from gas. For example, in the past, alcohol could only be made from grains and potatoes, and it took four tons of grain to produce one ton of alcohol. Now the Soviet Union has adopted a natural gas—ethylene—to make alcohol, which can save a lot of grain and labor. Gas can also be used for steelmaking, power generation, and driving cars...
    The Soviet Union is rich in gas reserves in its vast land. Currently, in the great forests of Siberia, in the desert areas of Central Asia, in western Ukraine, and in Baku, exploration personnel have discovered many gas production areas. Within ten to fifteen years, the Soviet Union will expand its gas production by twelve to fourteen times, that is, the annual output will reach 270 billion to 320 billion cubic meters. At that time, it will liberate millions of working people from unproductive labor in daily life, and gas can also be widely used for nitrogen fertilizer and other chemical products.
    The development of the Soviet gas industry is progressing rapidly. Before the Great Patriotic War, only six or seven cities in the Russian Federation used gas, but now there are seventy, and twenty-five more will be added this year. This year, the Soviet Union plans to increase gas production by 11 billion cubic meters, which can replace 15 million tons of coal. By 1960, 200 cities and towns will have gas supply. At that time, the capital Moscow will receive 10 billion cubic meters of gas, which is four times more than in 1956.
    Now, in the great forests and deserts of Central Asia, and on the steppes of Ukraine, construction workers are building gas enterprises day and night. They are striving to complete the plans formulated by the Party and the government ahead of schedule, so that the lives of the people of the motherland will be better. (Fang) (with picture)

    扩大煤气供应网
    再过几年，你翻开苏联的地图，就可以看见上面布满了像铁路线一样的纵横交错的黑线，这就是煤气供应网。在最近七年内，苏联将建成四万公里长的煤气管，为全苏煤气供应系统打下基础。1960年以前，这个系统就要包括十个加盟共和国了。
    对一个家庭主妇来说，最头痛的是每天同黑煤炉子打交道。不但麻烦，而且煤烟把屋子弄得很脏。现在苏联的许多家庭主妇都摆脱了这种烦恼，她们已经用上煤气了。煤气既方便，又便宜，仅莫斯科、列宁格勒和基辅三个城市的居民，由于使用天然煤气，一年间就可以节省三亿五千万卢布。
    煤气的用途当然不止这一项。你到商店去买衣服、袜子、皮包等日用品，会不会想到，其中很多是用天然煤气作原料制成的呢？制造汽车顶板、唱片、塑胶文具也有天然煤气的功劳。从煤气中可以得到酒精、醋酸等几百种东西。例如，过去只能用谷物和马铃薯做酒精，制一吨酒精就要耗费四吨谷物。现在苏联已经采用一种天然气——乙烯——做酒精，这样就能节省很多粮食和劳动力。煤气还可以用来炼钢、发电、开动汽车……。
    在苏维埃辽阔的土地中，煤气的蕴藏量很丰富。目前在西伯利亚大森林里，在中亚沙漠地带，在乌克兰西部以及巴库等地，勘探人员又发现了许多煤气产地。在十年到十五年内，苏联要扩大煤气产量十二到十四倍，即每年产量将达到二千七百至三千二百亿立方公尺。那时，就会解除千百万劳动人民在日常生活中的非生产性劳动，还可以广泛利用煤气做氮肥和其他化学产品。
    苏联煤气工业的发展一日千里。在伟大卫国战争以前，俄罗斯联邦共和国使用煤气的城市只有六、七个，现在已有七十个了，今年还要增加二十五个。今年全苏联准备增产一百一十亿立方公尺的煤气，可以代替一千五百万吨煤。到1960年，将有二百个城市和村镇得到煤气供应。那时首都莫斯科可以得到煤气一百亿立方公尺，即比1956年增加四倍。
    现在，在大森林和中亚的沙漠里，在乌克兰的草原上，建筑工人们日日夜夜不停地修建煤气企业。他们争取提前完成党和政府制定的计划，使祖国人民的生活更加美好。（方）（附图片）
