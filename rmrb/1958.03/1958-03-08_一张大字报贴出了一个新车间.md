    A Big-Character Poster Brings Forth a New Workshop
    "A big-character poster brings forth a new workshop." This is a popular anecdote circulating in the Yongli Ning Factory and the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory during the rectification campaign.
    Last year, according to instructions from higher authorities, the Yongli Ning Factory formulated a renovation plan for the third sulfuric acid system to increase its annual production capacity from more than 44,000 tons to 82,800 tons. This plan was submitted to the Ministry of Chemical Industry without careful consideration. Engineer He Weide and young technician Meng Xiangguang, who were responsible for the specific design of this plan, felt that the plan was unreasonable. It was called a renovation, but in reality, it would completely dismantle and replace a set of existing equipment, requiring an investment of 3.3 million yuan; the renovation would also cause a shutdown loss of 600,000 yuan; and after the renovation, the cramped equipment would bring long-term operational inconvenience. According to calculations, an additional investment of 2.59 million yuan would be enough to build a new sulfuric acid workshop with an annual output of 82,800 tons. At that time, they submitted this opinion to the factory leaders, but it was not adopted. During the rectification movement, at a meeting, they submitted their opinions to engineering and technical personnel for research. Everyone agreed that the renovation of the third sulfuric acid system was mainly to support the production needs of the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory, and the new sulfuric acid workshop was best attached to the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory to facilitate the organization of normal production. That night, they wrote two big-character posters with the same content, jointly signed by more than 50 engineering and technical personnel, one posted in the factory and one sent to the Ministry of Chemical Industry.
    This big-character poster greatly shocked the factory leaders. On the third day, the factory directors and chief engineers of Yongli Ning Factory and Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory gathered to study the opinions of the big-character poster. At the meeting, it was decided to stop the design work of the original plan and send people to the Ministry of Chemical Industry to appeal for the suggestion. At this time, the person in charge of the Production Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry also rushed to Nanjing to help solve the problem. After careful research, and with the approval of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, they cancelled the original renovation plan and decided to build a new sulfuric acid workshop in the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory. The first phase of the project will be completed before the end of September this year, with an annual output of 82,800 tons of sulfuric acid.
    When the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Factory is fully put into production, it will use 200,000 tons of dilute sulfuric acid annually. Before this new plan was decided, sulfuric acid mainly relied on imports from neighboring provinces hundreds of miles away, requiring a large amount of transportation equipment and transportation costs every year. After the new workshop is completed, the price of sulfuric acid can be reduced by 52%, saving 6.3 million yuan a year, and the investment can be recovered in eleven months.
    The rapid handling of this big-character poster encouraged the engineering and technical personnel. In December of last year, they had completed the preliminary design of the new workshop, and planned to complete the construction design before March 10. The civil engineering installation team also decided to adopt a cross-operation method, starting construction in February before the drawings were completed. They guaranteed to complete the construction two months ahead of the national requirements.

### 一张大字报贴出了一个新车间

    一张大字报贴出了一个新车间
    “一张大字报贴出一个新车间”。这是流传在永利宁厂和南京磷肥厂的一段整风佳话。
    去年，永利宁厂根据上级指示，制定了一个硫酸第三系统的改造方案，使这个系统的年产能力从四万四千多吨提高到八万二千八百吨，这个方案没有经过慎重研究就上报了化学工业部。负责这个方案具体设计的何维德工程师和青年技术员孟祥光感到这个方案不合理。它名为改造，实则要把一套原有设备完全拆除换新，投资三百三十万元；改建中还要造成价值六十万元的停工损失；改造以后由于设备拥挤，还将带来长期操作不方便的弊病。根据计算，只要再增加二百五十九万元投资，就可以新建一座年产八万二千八百吨的硫酸车间。当时他们把这个意见向厂领导上提了，没有被采纳。整风运动中，他们在一次会议上，把自己的意见提交工程技术人员研究，大家一致认为硫酸三系统的改造，主要是为了支援南京磷肥厂生产的需要，新的硫酸车间最好附设在南京磷肥厂内，以便利于组织正常生产。他们当晚就写了同样内容的两张大字报，由五十多位工程技术人员联合签署，一张贴在厂内，一张寄往化学工业部。
    这张大字报使工厂的领导人大为震动，第三天永利宁厂和南京磷肥厂的厂长、总工程师就集会研究大字报的意见，会上决定停止原方案的设计工作，并派人去化学工业部申述建议。就在这时，化学工业部也专派生产司负责人赶来南京帮助解决这个问题。他们经过周密研究，并经化学工业部批准，取消原来的改建方案，决定在南京磷肥厂新建一个硫酸车间，第一期工程今年9月底前完工，年产硫酸八万二千八百吨。
    建设中的南京磷肥厂全部投入生产，每年要用稀硫酸二十万吨。在这个新方案未决定之前，硫酸主要依靠几百里外的邻省输入，每年需要大量的运输设备和运输费用。新车间建成后，硫酸价格可以便宜52％，一年能节约六百三十万元，十一个月就能收回投资。
    这张大字报迅速得到处理，鼓舞了工程技术人员。去年12月一个月他们已完成新建车间的初步设计，计划在3月10日前完成施工设计。土木工程安装队也决定采用交叉作业的方法，不等图纸出齐，就在2月份动工。他们保证比国家要求再提前两个月建成。
