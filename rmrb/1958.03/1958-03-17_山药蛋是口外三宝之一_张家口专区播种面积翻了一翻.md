    Potatoes are one of the Three Treasures Outside the Pass
    Zhangjiakou Area Planting Area Doubles
    (Our Dispatch) This year, various places in Zhangjiakou Area, Hebei Province, are treating potatoes as distinguished guests. The entire area plans to plant 2.53 million mu of potatoes this year, nearly double the amount from last year.
    This area has always regarded potatoes as a staple food, and every meal is inseparable from them. The masses say: "Potatoes, naked oats, and sheepskin coats are the three treasures outside the pass."
    In 1952, this area planted the most potatoes, reaching 1.77 million mu. In 1955, it decreased to 1.26 million mu. In 1956, after cooperativization, there was a high yield boom, and it rose again to 1.46 million mu. In 1957, the anti-Rightist movement resulted in a drop to 1.39 million mu. This year, with the Great Leap Forward, after mass discussions, it has increased to 2.53 million mu. (Li Wanjun)

    山药蛋是口外三宝之一
    张家口专区播种面积翻了一翻
    本报讯　河北省张家口专区各地今年都把山药蛋当成座上佳宾。全专区今年计划播种二百五十三万亩山药蛋，比去年翻了将近一番。
    这个专区向来就把山药蛋当作主要的食粮，每顿饭都离不了它。群众说：“山药、莜麦、大皮袄，是口外三宗宝。”
    1952年，这个专区种山药最多，达到一百七十七万亩。1955年降到一百二十六万亩。1956年，合作化后闹高产，又上升到一百四十六万亩。1957年反冒进，又下降到了一百三十九万亩。今年大跃进，经过群众讨论，又增加到了二百五十三万亩。　（李万军）
