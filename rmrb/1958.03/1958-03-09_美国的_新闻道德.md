American "News Ethics"

Lloyd Jones, chairman of the "American Society of Newspaper Editors" and editor-in-chief of the Tulsa "Tribune" in Oklahoma, recently received the first annual "William White Foundation" award for outstanding editorial work. In mid-February, when Lloyd Jones accepted the award at the University of Kansas, he delivered a speech on "News Ethics."

According to "Time" magazine, Lloyd Jones frankly and openly confessed to the audience at the University of Kansas: "What we often report to our readers is nothing more than a mixture of truth and falsehood. Sometimes, we cover up all the facts."

Lloyd Jones cited many examples to illustrate his confession. He admitted that the obituaries published by the Tulsa "Tribune" often drastically deleted the deceased's past criminal records and sordid experiences. The "Tribune" never publishes reports that damage the "reputation" of the deceased. This is the "Tribune's" principle in dealing with the dead.

Lloyd Jones then introduced the "Tribune's" two attitudes towards the living to the audience. He said that the "Tribune's" social news reports also have two standards. For example, when reporting on the drunkenness and violence of alcoholics, only ordinary people can be targeted; never touch celebrities, wealthy merchants, or rich tycoons. Lloyd Jones said that an editor must adopt a compromising attitude when selecting manuscripts, otherwise, he will be asking for trouble and getting burned. This is one of the secrets of Lloyd Jones' "excellent" editorial work.

Lloyd Jones' attitude towards interviewing American government news is also typical. He told the audience:

"Some journalists believe that all public affairs should be open, except for matters directly related to national defense. I disagree with this view, because most politicians—even statesmen—are only willing to tell the truth and seriously discuss issues in closed rooms... Without this, it is impossible to formulate a sound policy. If the decision-makers are being monitored by the press, it is impossible to tell the truth..."

The fact that Lloyd Jones, chairman of the "American Society of Newspaper Editors," who conceals the truth from readers, whitewashes and whitewashes monopoly capitalists, slanders and slanders the working people, and flatters the reactionary ruling group in every possible way, "won" the award for outstanding editorial work fully illustrates what the "news ethics" of the money kingdom is all about.

### 美国的“新闻道德”

    美国的“新闻道德”
    “美国报刊编者协会”主席、俄克拉荷马州塔尔萨城“论坛报”总编辑劳合·琼斯，最近获得了美国“威廉·怀特基金”首次颁发的优秀主编工作奖。2月中旬，劳合·琼斯在堪萨斯大学领奖时，发表了有关“新闻道德”的演说。
    据美国“时代周刊”报道，劳合·琼斯在堪萨斯大学现身说法、直言无隐地向听众供认：“我们向读者们经常报道的不过是一些真假搀半的东西，有时候，我们把全部事实掩盖起来。”
    劳合·琼斯举出了不少的实例来说明他的招供。他承认塔尔萨“论坛报”所发表的死者传略，往往大刀阔斧地删略了死者过去的犯罪记录、丑恶经历。“论坛报”从来不刊登有损死者“名誉”的报道。这是“论坛报”对待死人的原则。
    劳合·琼斯又向听众介绍了“论坛报”对待活人的两种态度。他说，“论坛报”的社会新闻报道，也有两种标准。例如，在报道酗酒者的醉态与狂暴的行为时，只可以选择市井小人为对象，千万不要触及名门显贵、豪富巨商。劳合·琼斯说，一个编者在选择稿件的时候，必须抱着一种妥协的态度，否则自讨麻烦、引火烧身。这就是劳合·琼斯“优秀的”主编工作的一个秘诀。
    劳合·琼斯对采访美国政府新闻所持的态度也是典型的。他向听众说：
    “有些新闻工作者认为，一切公共事务都应该公开，只有与国防直接有关的事情不在此例。我不同意这种看法，因为大多数的政客——乃至于政治家——都只是在密室里才肯说出真心话来、才肯认真地谈问题……不如此就无法拟订一个健全的政策。如果决策的人受到了新闻界的监视，要说真心话就不可能了……”
    向读者隐瞒事实真相、为垄断资本家粉饰洗刷、对劳动人民进行诬蔑诽谤、向反动统治集团百般献媚的“美国报刊编者协会”主席劳合·琼斯“荣获”优秀主编工作奖的事实，充分说明了金元王国的“新闻道德”究竟是什么一回事。
