    Rectification Campaign Outside the Door
    He Zhuo
    Several places have created a method of "rectification campaign outside the door." "Rectification campaign outside the door" means that leading organs do not conduct rectification campaigns sitting in their offices, but go to grassroots organizations or invite people from grassroots organizations to conduct rectification campaigns together.
    Today, everyone will raise their hands in favor of opposing waste and opposing conservatism. But what is waste and what is conservatism? Views are not entirely the same, or even completely opposite. This will inevitably lead to controversy. This controversy is of course necessary. But for those who cite classics and are eloquent in trying to explain that they "have neither waste nor conservatism," the best way is not to engage in paper-based debates with them in the office, but to open the door and go to the site for debate. The Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute has used this method and has achieved good results.
    When this design institute first started its anti-waste and anti-conservative campaign, some people did not admit that there was waste or conservatism in their work. These people also collected various foreign materials to prove that their design was absolutely correct. The leaders of the Coal Mine Design Institute did not engage in this kind of paper-based debate with these people, but led them out of the office to the site for debate. "You don't know the goods until you compare them." Through a series of facts, these people had to admit that there was indeed waste in their design and that there was serious dogmatism divorced from reality.
    There are also different views on the size of waste and the seriousness of conservative thinking in their own organizations. Some say it is big, some say it is small, some say it is serious, some say it is light, and some, although admitting that it is not small or light, cannot produce facts. For these people, they also need to go to grassroots units to listen to the opinions of others. The grassroots units know best whether their waste is big or small and whether their conservative thinking is light or serious, and they can produce many powerful facts to prove it. When cadres of the Shanghai Yulin District Party Committee Propaganda Department initially sat in the office to oppose waste and oppose conservatism, they did not see the "five airs" in themselves. After going to the bicycle factory, they saw the "bureaucratic air" in themselves, and the anti-waste and anti-conservative campaign had a way to go.
    Going out for rectification is not only good for general staff, but also good for leading cadres. Those who did not know much about the situation can learn more; those who lacked methods can find many methods. The leaders of the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute did not know much about the actual situation and had no idea about opposing waste and opposing conservatism. After this on-site debate, they knew what to do and became more determined in leading the anti-waste and anti-conservative campaign.
    The method of "rectification campaign outside the door" is worth promoting greatly.

    出门整风
    何卓
    好几个地方创造了一种“出门整风”的方法。“出门整风”就是说领导机关不是坐在办公室里整风，而是到基层组织中去或邀请基层组织的人一起来整风。
    今天，对于反浪费反保守，谁都会举手赞成。但是对于什么是浪费，什么是保守？看法还不完全相同，甚至完全相反。这样，就势必要引起争论。这种争论当然是必要的。可是对那些引经据典，振振有辞地力图说明自己“既无浪费，又无保守”的人，最好的方法，不是关在办公室里，同他们进行纸上谈兵式的争论，而是开门走到现场中去争论。北京煤矿设计院运用这个方法，已经收到了很好的效果。
    这个设计院刚开始进行反浪费反保守的时候，有人不承认自己工作中有浪费有保守，这些人还搜集了各种国外资料，准备证明自己的设计是绝对正确的。煤矿设计院的领导方面不同这些人作这种纸上谈兵式的争论，而是领导他们走出办公室，到现场去争论。“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”，通过一系列的事实，这些人不得不承认自己设计中确有浪费现象，并有严重的脱离实际的教条主义思想。
    对于自己机关里的浪费大小，保守思想轻重，也有着不完全相同的看法，有的说大，有的说小，有的说重，有的说轻，也有的虽然承认不小不轻，但又拿不出事实来。对于这些人，也需要他们到基层单位去听听别人的意见。他们的浪费是大是小，保守思想是轻是重，基层单位最了解，可以拿出许多有力的事实来证明。上海榆林区委宣传部干部起初坐在机关里反浪费反保守，就看不到自己身上有“五气”，到自行车厂去了以后，就看到了自己身上的“官气”，反浪费反保守也就有了门路。
    出门整风，不仅仅对于一般工作人员有好处，对于领导干部同样有好处，本来了解情况不多的，就可以了解更多的情况；本来缺少办法的，就可以找到许多办法。北京煤矿设计院的领导人，原来对实际情况了解不多，对反浪费反保守心中无数。经过这一次现场辩论以后，心中有数了，对反浪费反保守的领导也更加坚决了。
    “出门整风”的办法，值得大大提倡。
