    Basically Eliminated Illiteracy Nine Years Ahead of Schedule
    Young and Middle-Aged People in Ning'an County are All Literate
    (Reported by this newspaper) By the end of January this year, Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, had basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy among all young and middle-aged people in the county nine years ahead of schedule, in accordance with the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). At present, the proportion of non-illiterates in Ning'an County has reached 81% of the county's urban and rural young and middle-aged population.
    Among the 102,600 young and middle-aged people in the county's urban and rural areas, more than 75% were originally illiterate. Since the anti-illiteracy campaign began in 1948, more than 42,000 people had obtained certificates of literacy by the end of 1957. At present, among the young and middle-aged people in the county, apart from more than 3,000 people who have lost their learning ability due to illness and disability, there are only 16,222 semi-literates. Among these semi-literates, some have already recognized more than 800 characters, and most have already recognized more than 1,000 characters. In the anti-illiteracy work, more than 1,800 mass teachers were trained, and tens of thousands of anti-illiteracy activists emerged.
    After improving their education, the vast number of grassroots cadres greatly improved their working ability. Literate farmers have a deeper understanding of the Party's policies than in the past. Tian Zhengchun and Zhang Baoshan, two young carpenters in Yulin Cooperative, often read agricultural technical pamphlets after becoming literate. Later, they created a seed mixing device, which was eight or nine times more efficient than manual seed mixing. They also created a granular fertilizer manufacturing device and improved the rice threshing machine. The improved cultural level of farmers has also greatly promoted water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, soil improvement, new variety cultivation, livestock development, and technology promotion.
    There is such a story circulating in the United Agricultural Cooperative, which eliminated illiteracy on October 1, 1956: Before Production Team Leader Song Facheng became literate, he could not even record work points and calculate accounts. He drew many houses on a large piece of paper according to the addresses of the team members to represent the names of the commune members. If a commune member did one day of work, he would draw a stroke on the house; if a commune member did half a day of work, he would draw a dot on the house. As time went by, each house became a dot and a stroke, and it was impossible to figure out who had done the work, and the team members had a lot of opinions. Song Facheng then decided to learn to read. Now he has graduated from the spare-time primary school class, and his work accounts are clear and accurate, which has been praised by the people. There are more than 160 such cadres in the county, just Party branch secretaries and cooperative directors, who have changed from being illiterate to being able to write and calculate.
    The cultural life of the county's farmers has undergone significant changes. Reading newspapers and books has become a need in people's lives, and more than 42,000 copies of various newspapers and periodicals have been subscribed to in the county's rural areas. Rural clubs, libraries, amateur theater troupes, singing teams, and sports teams are all over the townships and cooperatives, and various cultural and recreational activities are often carried out. Most clubs also often hold weekend evenings, performing small plays, operas, Errenzhuan, music, folk songs, and sometimes group dances and social dances. Due to the development of proper cultural entertainment, social customs have greatly changed, and backward phenomena such as shamanistic practices, gambling, unsanitary habits, and arranged marriages have almost disappeared. A new atmosphere of love, unity, and mutual assistance has also been enhanced between families and neighbors.

    提前九年基本上扫除了文盲
    宁安县青壮年人人识字
    本报讯　黑龙江省宁安县到今年1月底，按照全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，已提前九年基本上完成了扫除全县青壮年文盲的任务。目前宁安县非文盲的比例已达到该县城乡青壮年人数的81％。
    这个县城乡十万二千六百名青壮年当中，原有75％以上的人是文盲。1948年开始扫盲工作以来，到1957年年底，获得扫除文盲证书的人已达四万二千多人。目前全县青壮年中，除了有三千多人因病残丧失学习条件外，只有一万六千二百二十二名半文盲，在这些半文盲中，有一部分人已经认识了八百多字，大部分人已经认识了一千多字。在扫盲工作中，培养了一千八百多名群众教师，涌现了几万名扫盲积极分子。
    广大基层干部在提高了文化以后，大大提高了工作能力。识字的农民对党的政策比过去理解得深了。榆林社有两个青年木工田正纯、张宝山，识字后经常看农业技术小册子，以后他俩创造了一个拌种器，比人工拌种的效力提高了八、九倍。他俩还创造了颗粒肥料制造器和改进了打稻机。农民文化水平提高了，在兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤、培育新品种、发展牧畜业、推广技术等方面也起了很大的促进作用。
    在1956年10月1日扫除了文盲的联合农业社里流传着这样一个故事：生产队长宋发成在不识字前记工算账都不会，他是在一张大纸上按着队员的住址画上许多房子，表示社员的名字，这个社员作一个工，就在房子上画一道，那个社员作半个工，又在那个房子上画一点。天长日久，各个房子都变成了一点一道的，究竟是谁作的工也弄不清了，队员们很有意见。宋发成就下决心学文化，现在他已经在业余小学班毕业，工账记得清清楚楚，受到了人们的赞扬。像宋发成这样的由文盲而变成会写会算的干部，全县仅党支部书记和合作社主任就有一百六十多名。
    全县农民的文化生活面貌有了显著的变化。群众阅读书报已成为生活的需要，全县农村就订阅了各种报刊四万二千多份。农村俱乐部、图书室、业余剧团、歌咏队、球队遍及各乡各社，经常进行各种文化娱乐活动。多数俱乐部还常常举行周末晚会，演出小型话剧、歌剧、二人转、音乐、民歌小调，有时还跳团体舞和交谊舞。由于正当的文化娱乐的开展，社会风气大变，像跳大神、赌博、不讲卫生、买卖婚姻等落后现象几乎绝迹了。家庭邻里间也增强了友爱团结互助的新气象。
