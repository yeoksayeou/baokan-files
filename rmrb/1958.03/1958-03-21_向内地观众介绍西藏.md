Introducing Tibet to Mainland Audiences
“Song of Mount Everest” Director Liu Deyuan

"Song of Mount Everest" was filmed to introduce the situation in Tibet to the people of the mainland. It reflects the local customs, religious beliefs, historical sites, geographical scenery, and the new life of the Tibetan brothers.

The Tibetan Plateau is rich and productive. The deep mountains and valleys contain various minerals; agricultural products are also very abundant. The highland barley grown in the Shannan area of Tibet is very robust, with yields exceeding a thousand catties per mu; the "Jiangnan" of Tibet—the Loyu area—can be planted three seasons a year, producing abundant wet and dry rice, as well as subtropical fruits such as bananas and oranges. After liberation, cabbage, watermelon, tomatoes, and other vegetables transplanted to the plateau not only grow well here but also have higher yields than in the mainland. We have captured these interesting scenes in the film.

The Tibetan brothers have a long history, and there has been close and extensive exchanges between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, which must be one of the main contents of the film. We focused on filming the relics brought to Tibet from the mainland by Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty, such as the bronze statue of Sakyamuni in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, the Tang willow and Tang stele in front of the temple, and the twenty-four Tang embroidery pieces preserved in the Ganden Monastery. We also filmed the gold and jade seals and imperial edicts bestowed by emperors of various dynasties to the Tibetan kings, the Han Chinese plaques in the palace, and some decorations similar to those of the Han Chinese seen in the houses and tents inhabited by Tibetans.

In Tibet, we deeply felt that people have full freedom of religious belief. Every household has a Buddhist hall, and every rooftop or tent has a long pole with colorful cloth prayer flags hanging on it. Imperialists spread rumors that we restricted people here from becoming lamas. Here, in the Drepung Monastery in Lhasa, we filmed the process of a child becoming a lama. Let the facts refute the lies of the imperialists.

We also introduced some of Tibet's cultural and artistic treasures. For example, the architecture of the monasteries and the colorful folk dances allow the audience to appreciate some of the treasures in the art treasury of the motherland. In addition, in the deep mountains and wild valleys of northern Tibet, we also filmed groups of wild animals, such as wild donkeys and wild sheep, which are rarely seen in the mainland.

Since the liberation of Tibet, there has been great development and progress in all aspects. A new-type People's Hospital has been established below the Potala Palace; Lhasa Middle School, the first middle school in Tibetan history, opened in the spring of last year. The birth of this school is one of the bridges for the Tibetan brothers to move towards new cultural construction. The appearance of the Tibetan-language Tibet Daily on the plateau is a harbinger of the new cultural life of Tibet. We have filmed these new things and introduced them to the audience.

### 向内地观众介绍西藏

    向内地观众介绍西藏
    “珠穆朗玛之歌”导演　刘德源
    “珠穆朗玛之歌”是为了向内地人民介绍西藏的情况而拍摄的。它反映了那里的人情风俗、宗教信仰、历史古迹、地理风光及藏族兄弟新的生活面貌。
    西藏高原是富饶多产的。重山深谷里蕴藏着多种矿产；农产品也非常丰富。西藏的山南地区生长的青稞很茁壮，产量每亩都在千斤以上；西藏的“江南”——珞渝地区，一年可种三季，盛产水旱稻子，还产亚热带水果，如香蕉、柑子等等。解放后移植到高原的洋白菜、西瓜、西红柿等，在这里不仅长得好而且产量还比内地高。这些有趣的情景，我们都把它摄入了镜头。
    藏族兄弟有着悠久的历史，汉族藏族之间曾经有过亲密而广泛的交往，这不能不作为影片主要内容之一。我们着重拍摄了唐代文成公主由内地带到西藏的遗物。如拉萨大昭寺内的释迦牟尼铜像，寺前的唐柳、唐碑，以及存在甘丹寺内的二十四幅唐绣等。我们还拍到了历代皇帝封赐藏王的金、玉印、诏书和宫廷的汉文扁额，以及在藏族居住的房屋、帐篷里看到的一些和汉族相同的装饰。
    在西藏，我们深深感到人们有着充分宗教信仰的自由。家家户户都有佛堂，家家房顶上或帐篷上都立有长杆，杆上挂有各色的布质经幡。帝国主义者造谣说，我们限制了这里人去当喇嘛，在这里，我们在拉萨哲蚌寺拍到了一个孩子出家当喇嘛的过程。让事实去击回帝国主义者的谎言。
    我们也介绍了一些西藏的文化艺术宝藏。例如寺院的建筑和多彩的民间歌舞，使观众能够领略一些祖国的艺术宝库中这一部分珍品。另外，我们在藏北的深山野谷里，还拍到了成群的野生的动物，如野驴、野羊等，这些在内地也是很少见到的。
    西藏解放以后，各方面都有很大的发展和进步。一座新型的人民医院在布达拉宫下面建立起来了；西藏历史上第一座中学——拉萨中学，从去年春天开课了。这个学校的诞生，是藏族兄弟走向新文化建设的桥梁之一。而藏文的西藏日报在高原上的出现，更是藏族新文化生活的前声。我们把这些新事情都拍摄了下来，介绍给观众。
