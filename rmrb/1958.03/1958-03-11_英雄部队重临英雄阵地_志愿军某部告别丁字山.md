Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th -- A heroic unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, soon to be withdrawn from Korea, made a special trip to the famous heroic heights of "Dingshan Mountain" to bid farewell. In January 1953, this heroic unit, with a single platoon, steadfastly defended "Dingshan Mountain," continuously and fiercely repulsing a reinforced battalion of the American invading forces, personally commanded by Van Fleet, in a "demonstration attack," killing and wounding more than two hundred of the enemy, much to the disappointment of the officers of various satellite countries and the Western news agency reporters who had come to observe the battle.

The officers and soldiers of this heroic unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, adorned with gleaming medals and commemorative badges, revisited the "Dingshan Mountain" positions. They carefully searched for rusted shrapnel and bullet heads left behind from those years in every tunnel, trench, bunker, and bomb crater. Or they would grab a handful of dirt and pebbles from the places where they had fought, each packing them into small cloth bags to take back to the motherland as souvenirs. Second Lieutenant Huang Yuanyue, a third-class meritorious soldier, took off his military cap and stood in solemn silence beside a fortification, his eyes filled with tears, offering a deep tribute to the second-class People's Hero, Martyr Chen Zhi, who had given his life here. At the most critical moment, he had stepped forward to act as platoon leader, leading the entire platoon of comrades to victoriously defend "Dingshan Mountain."

Standing atop "Dingshan Mountain," where the spring wind had swept away the accumulated snow, amidst the rumbling artillery fire of war provocation exercises being conducted by the U.S. and Rhee forces from the southern edge of the demilitarized zone, the soldiers faced the seven award banners they had brought up the mountain, inscribed with heroic words such as "Not an inch of land shall be yielded, steadfastly defend the heroic position," and "Defeat the many with the few, strike fear into the enemy's hearts." They held a solemn oath-taking ceremony, raising their arms and shouting vows to defend peace.

On this heroic hill standing tall on the northern edge of the demilitarized zone, the officers and soldiers of the heroic unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers planted rows of Masson pines, letting these Masson pines symbolize the evergreen friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

    英雄部队重临英雄阵地
    志愿军某部告别丁字山
    新华社平壤10日电　即将撤离朝鲜的一支中国人民志愿军英雄部队，日前特地到著名的英雄阵地“丁字山”告别。这支英雄部队在1953年1月间，曾经以一个排的兵力坚守在“丁字山”上，连续痛击了范佛里特亲自指挥的美国侵略军一个加强营的“示范进攻”，并杀伤其二百多人，使那些观战的各仆从国军官们和西方通讯社的记者们败兴而归。
    这支志愿军英雄部队的官兵们佩戴着金光闪闪的奖章和纪念章，重临“丁字山”阵地时，他们从每一个坑道、堑壕、地堡和弹坑里，仔细地寻觅着当年遗留下来的生锈的炮弹片和子弹头，或者在自己曾经作战过的地方抓把泥土和石子，各自装进小布袋里准备带回祖国作纪念。三等功臣黄元月少尉脱下军帽，热泪盈眶地肃立在一座工事旁边，向在这里献出生命的二级人民英雄陈志烈士致深沉的悼念。他在最危急关头挺身而出代理排长，指挥全排战友胜利保卫了“丁字山”
    战士们站在春风扫尽积雪的“丁字山”顶，在来自非军事区南缘的美李军进行战争挑衅演习的隆隆炮声中，面对着他们带上山来的写有“寸土不让坚守英雄阵地，以少胜多叫敌胆战心惊”等豪语的七面奖旗，举行了庄严的宣誓，他们振臂高呼着保卫和平的誓言。
    在这座屹立在非军事区北缘的英雄山岗上，志愿军英雄部队的官兵们栽下了一行行马尾松，让这些马尾松象征中朝人民友谊的万古长青。
