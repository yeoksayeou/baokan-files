    Selecting cotton seeds can result in strong cotton seedlings. Strong and vigorous cotton seedlings will inevitably have an enhanced ability to resist adverse natural conditions, and the phenomena of seedling death and missing seedlings will be reduced. During selection, some light seeds, green seeds, sparsely haired seeds, and other miscellaneous and atypical cotton seeds can be eliminated. According to experiments conducted by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, variations in seed type directly affect the excellent characteristics of subsequent cotton plants. Eliminating these miscellaneous and atypical cotton seeds is also beneficial for improving cotton yield and quality.

    In 1956, the climate was unfavorable in many cotton-growing areas. The cotton seeds reserved for planting in these areas were generally of poor quality. For example, in Tong County, Hebei Province, many cotton seeds had a germination rate of only 50%; in Anhui Province, many cotton seeds also had a germination rate of only slightly over 60%; in Yancheng, Xuzhou, Huaiyin and other special districts in Jiangsu Province, only 50% of the cotton seeds were relatively strong. Although last year's climate was better than in 1956, some cotton fields in areas of Shandong, Henan, Hebei and other provinces were harmed by the autumn drought. A certain proportion of the cotton seeds stored in these areas are semi-mature. The poorer the quality of the cotton seeds, the greater the proportion of cotton seeds that are rejected as unsuitable for planting during seed selection. Without seed selection, a large number of cotton seeds that could be used as oil and feed will be wasted.

    Judging from the current situation, some cotton-growing areas have not yet started selecting cotton seeds. Some agricultural cooperatives are afraid of spending more work points and are preparing not to select cotton seeds. This is a practice of "attending to trifles and neglecting essentials." The fact that some rural work cadres have not actively promoted this work is also an important reason why the work of selecting cotton seeds has not been carried out in some areas. There is still considerable time before cotton sowing. As long as we actively promote, carefully arrange, and carry out this work, there will still be enough time.

    粒选棉种培育壮苗
    播种粒选的棉种，可以收到棉苗茁壮的效果。棉苗生长健旺，抵抗自然条件劣变的能力必然增强，死苗、缺苗现象就会减少。粒选的时候，可以淘汰掉一些光籽、绿籽、稀毛籽等杂色异型的棉籽。根据华东农业科学研究所的试验，种型的变异，直接影响到后代棉株的优良特性。淘汰这些杂色异型棉籽，对提高棉花产量和质量也有一定好处。
    1956年很多棉区气候不好。这些地区保留作种的棉籽，一般质量很差。如河北省通县专区，很多棉种发芽率只有50％；安徽省很多棉种的发芽率也只有60％多；江苏省盐城、徐州、淮阴等专区的棉种，比较健壮的只占50％。去年的气候虽比1956年好，但是山东、河南、河北等省的一些地区的棉田都受到秋旱的为害。这些地区留储的棉籽，有一定比重是半成熟的。棉种质量越差，粒选时剔出的不合种用的棉籽的比例愈大，如果不加粒选还会白白浪费掉大量可以作油料、饲料的棉籽。
    从目前情况看，有些棉区粒选棉种还没有开始。有的农业社怕多开支工分，准备不粒选棉种了。这是“顾小失大”的做法。部分农村工作干部，没有积极推动这一工作，也是部分地区棉种粒选工作没有开展起来的一个重要原因。现在距离棉花播种还有相当期间，只要积极推动，认真布置，开展这项工作在时间上还来得及。
