Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, March 22nd. The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub dam project on the Yellow River began pouring concrete on the 17th. On that day, the Sanmenxia builders held a foundation ceremony in the foundation pit on the left bank of the dam. Li Baohua, Zhang Hanying, and Qian Zhengying, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and Soviet expert Zhukovsky also attended the ceremony to congratulate the builders.

The concrete pouring of the Sanmenxia Dam marks the first construction peak of the hub project. To date, the builders have excavated 330,000 cubic meters of rock from the dam foundation line spanning the provinces of Shanxi and Henan, reducing the three islands (Guimen, Shenmen, and Renmen Islands) by one and a half, and merging the three torrents into one; the Zheng (zhou)-Luo (yang)-San (menxia) high-voltage power transmission line has long been connected to Sanmenxia, and the Sanmenxia railway spur line connecting to the Longhai Railway has also been opened to traffic ahead of schedule; the Lingbao quarry was completed ahead of schedule.

Under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the Sanmenxia builders put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard for three years, intercepting floods one year ahead of schedule, generating electricity six months ahead of schedule, and completing the project one year ahead of schedule by the end of 1961." In order to save time, the builders erected a pontoon bridge and established a temporary concrete mixing plant before the steel bridge downstream of Sanmenxia was completed, and built a stone cofferdam. Now, the construction area of ​​hundreds of miles above and below Sanmenxia presents a busy scene of large-scale construction everywhere.

    三门峡进入施工高峰
    拦河大坝开始浇灌混凝土
    据新华社三门峡22日电黄河三门峡水利枢纽拦河大坝工程，17日开始浇灌混凝土。这一天，三门峡建设者在大坝左岸的基坑里举行了奠基典礼。水利电力部副部长李葆华、张含英、钱正英和苏联专家茹可夫斯基等人也参加了典礼，向建设者祝贺。
    三门峡大坝浇灌混凝土，是枢纽工程的第一个施工高峰。到目前为止：建设者从跨晋、豫两省的坝基线上挖掉石方三十三万立公方，使三岛（鬼门、神门、人门三岛）削去一个半，三股雄流汇成一股；郑（州）——洛（阳）——三（门峡）高压输电线早已通到了三门峡，连接陇海路的三门峡铁路专用线，也提前全线通车；灵宝采石厂提前建成。
    在全国大跃进形势下，三门峡建设者提出：“苦战三年，提前一年拦洪，提前半年发电，提前一年在1961年底竣工”的口号。为了赢得时间，建设者们在三门峡下游钢桥未建成以前，架设了浮桥，建立了临时混凝搅拌厂，并修筑石围堰。现在三门峡上下百里的施工场区，到处呈现出大施工的繁忙景象。
