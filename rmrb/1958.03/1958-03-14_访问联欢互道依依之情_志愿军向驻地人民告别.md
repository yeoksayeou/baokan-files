Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 13th – In many cities and villages in Korea these days, from morning till late at night, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who are about to return home, are bidding farewell to the Korean elders and brothers in the vicinity of their garrisons, beating drums and gongs. Leading organs at all levels of the returning Volunteer Army units have also sent representatives, carrying silk banners, farewell letters, peace medals, and various cultural and recreational equipment as gifts, to bid farewell to Korean governments at all levels. Units at the regimental level and above have also invited responsible comrades from the local Party and government, representatives of mass organizations, and model figures to hold farewell gatherings.

The officers and soldiers of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army about to return home collectively donated money to buy a double-wheeled double-furrow plow, which they presented to the masses in the garrison area who had supported the Volunteer Army during the war. The officers and soldiers of a certain regiment gave the pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks they raised to the members of the women's alliance of a certain county, thanking them for carrying stretchers, setting up tea stations, and caring for the sick and wounded for the Volunteer Army during the war.

On the eve of their departure, Bian Defeng, the director of the political department of a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army, led more than 40 officers and soldiers to send more than 3,000 jin of corn, a sheep, and more than 250 jin of chemical fertilizer that they had produced to the agricultural cooperative where the Korean elders Li Shouchang and Jin Quanshun, who guarded the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery, were located. For more than three years, these two Korean elders went to the cemetery to drain water after every rain, and to sweep snow after every snowfall, and they often added soil, repaired tombs, and planted various flowers and plants for the cemetery. During festivals, they also told the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army martyrs to the people who came to pay their respects at the martyrs' cemetery.

The Volunteer Army officers and soldiers who are about to return home also bid farewell to a woman known as "Volunteer Army Mother," Liu Mei, with deep affection. This "Volunteer Army Mother" has always cared for the Volunteer Army soldiers as if they were her own sons. Now, as they are about to depart, some Volunteer Army soldiers are carrying the piglets they raised to give to her, and some are using white paper to decorate her walls and windows. Zhang Lichun, a first-class merit recipient and anti-aircraft machine gunner, framed a photo of him and Liu Mei as a souvenir for her, with the words "Bidding farewell to Mom and returning to the motherland, the friendship between China and Korea will last forever" written in the frame.

The officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army returning home bid farewell to the glorious Korean People's Army dependents and martyrs' families with excitement. The soldiers presented them with honorary flowers and friendship plaques, helped them carry water and chop firewood, and held friendly get-togethers with them.

    访问联欢互道依依之情
    志愿军向驻地人民告别
    新华社平壤13日电  这几天，在朝鲜的许多城镇和乡村，从白天到深夜，都有将要归国的中国人民志愿军官兵敲锣打鼓，向驻地附近的朝鲜父老兄弟告别。志愿军归国部队各级领导机关还派出代表，携带着锦旗、告别书、和平纪念章和各种文娱器材等礼品，到朝鲜各级政府，向他们告别。各部队团以上单位还邀请驻地党、政负责人和群众团体代表、模范人物进行联欢。
    志愿军即将归国部队某部第三营的官兵，集体捐钱买了一部双轮双铧犁，送给驻地曾经在战争中支援志愿军的群众。某团官兵把自己养的猪、羊、鸡、鸭，赠送给某郡女性同盟盟员，感谢她们曾在战争中为志愿军抬担架、设茶水站、护理伤病员。
    在离别前夕，志愿军某团政治处主任边德峰少校，带领四十多名官兵，把他们生产的三千多斤玉米和一只羊，以及二百五十多斤化学肥料，送给看守志愿军烈士陵园的朝鲜老人李寿昌、金全顺所在的农业合作社。三年多来，这两位朝鲜老人每逢雨后，到陵园去排水，雪后去扫雪，并且经常为陵园添土、修墓地、栽种各种花草。在逢年过节的时候，他们还给前来凭吊烈士陵园的人们，讲述志愿军烈士的英雄事迹。
    即将归国的志愿军官兵，还亲切地向一位被称为“志愿军妈妈”柳梅告别。这位“志愿军妈妈”一直像对待自己的儿子一样地爱护志愿军战士。现在，当他们要离别的时候，有的志愿军战士挑着他们养的小猪送给她，有的用白纸为她粉饰屋壁和窗户。一等功臣、高射机枪手张立春把他和柳梅合影的一张照片，镶在镜框里给她做纪念，镜框里写着：“辞别妈妈回祖国，中朝友谊万年青。”
    志愿军归国部队的官兵们怀着激动的心情向光荣的朝鲜人民军军属和烈属告别。战士们向他们赠送了光荣花、友谊匾，还帮助他们担水打柴，一起举行友谊联欢会。
