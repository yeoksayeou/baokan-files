Dressing the Motherland in Floral Robes and Emerald Green Attire
—Some Basic Knowledge About Greening
Green, the green of trees, who can see them without feeling refreshed and full of vitality? Green is a gift from nature, and also a creation of human labor. A high tide of greening and afforestation has been set off in various parts of our country, and millions of hands are planting poplars, willows, and castor beans... This is not only to make our living environment more fresh and comfortable, but also to allow this beautiful nature to better serve our great leap forward in production.

Trees and forests can prevent drought and flood, resist wind and sand, conserve water and soil, and protect fertile soil from drying out or turning into sandy wasteland. It is a raw material for industry and also a material for people's needs. Let us all plant trees. The following are several trees worth promoting and simple planting methods.

Locust
Locust is also called black locust. It likes sunlight very much, can tolerate drought and barren soil, but is not resistant to waterlogging. Locust has strong germination ability, can fix soil and conserve water, and prevent soil erosion. Its roots have rhizobia, which can increase nitrogen fertilizer in the soil, which is very beneficial to improving the soil. It is suitable for afforestation in sandy wasteland, loess hills, and wasteland areas with lower terrain.

Locust wood is hard, has fine texture, is not easy to crack, is not afraid of moisture, and is not easy to rot. It can be used for railway sleepers, mine pillars, utility poles, bridges, etc. The bark is a raw material for papermaking, weaving coarse cloth and nets; the leaves can be used as feed and fertilizer; and can also be used as a substitute for tea. Locust flowers can be used to make perfume. Farmers in North China often use this flower to mix in flour to make steamed buns.

Planting locust trees along railways and highways can quickly protect the roadbed and provide sleepers and utility poles. Planting locust trees in parks, factories, schools, agencies, residences, and along roads can achieve the purpose of greening and perfuming. Locust has thorns, and livestock such as donkeys and horses do not like to gnaw on it, which can avoid livestock damage. The propagation method of locust is best to raise seedlings for afforestation, and root cutting can also be used for afforestation. As for direct seeding for afforestation, because the seeds germinate slowly and it is difficult to protect the seedlings after they emerge, this method is generally not recommended.
				(Wang Chaoyun)

Chinese Toon
The Chinese Toon tree grows rapidly, and has drought resistance, alkali resistance, and, in particular, strong resistance to smoke and pests. In areas with a lot of smoke and dust, many tree species are not suitable for growth, only the Chinese Toon tree can grow normally. Therefore, Chinese Toon is a good tree species for afforestation in industrial and mining areas with a lot of smoke and dust, and is also suitable for planting on roadsides or in gardens.

Chinese Toon wood has a wide range of uses. It can not only be used as a material for construction and furniture, but also is an excellent raw material for papermaking. The roots and leaves of Chinese Toon can also be used to treat dysentery, sores, scabies, wind sores, infantile malnutrition, and stop bleeding. In Shandong and other places, people also use Chinese Toon leaves to raise Toon silkworms, and Toon silkworm silk fabrics are similar to tussah silk.

Chinese Toon is suitable for sowing and raising seedlings in early March. The afforestation land is suitable for planting on loose soil slopes. It can also grow in barren, dry, or degraded wasteland with loose soil, but it does not grow well in clay soil. Also, because Chinese Toon has developed roots and strong tillering ability, it can be propagated by root division. (Du Huifu)

Sichuan Pepper
Sichuan Pepper is an excellent tree species for greening around houses. In places with suitable climate and soil, seedlings can generally grow to four or five feet tall in one year. Its wood can be compared with precious tree species such as Phoebe zhennan, camphor, and sassafras; the wood color is bright, and people like to use it as better furniture. Except for Northeast China and other relatively cold places, almost all parts of China have Sichuan Pepper trees. The tender buds of Sichuan Pepper that emerge in the spring have a special fragrance, called Toon buds, and can be used for food.

For Sichuan Pepper afforestation, it is necessary to choose fertile and moist soil. There are two planting methods: one is the root division method. Near large trees, there are often seedlings sprouting from the roots. The root division method is to dig up these small seedlings for planting. However, this method cannot obtain a large number of seedlings, and the survival rate after planting is not high.

The other is the seed collection and seedling cultivation method. This method is to collect seeds from the mother tree of Sichuan Pepper and cultivate the seeds into seedlings for planting. Sichuan Pepper fruits generally mature in early October. The harvested fruits should be placed in a ventilated, dry place without smoke and steam for sowing and seedling cultivation next spring. For Sichuan Pepper seedling cultivation, detailed land preparation must be carried out before sowing, and sufficient base fertilizer should be applied. When sowing, the soil should not be covered too thickly, just enough to cover the seeds. After sowing, water should be watered frequently to keep the soil moist. After germination, timely thinning, soil cultivation, weeding, drought prevention, flood control, and pest control should be carried out. In this way, it can be used for afforestation after autumn. Before planting, the land must be prepared first. When planting, the seedling roots should not be bent or twisted, and the soil should be covered tightly so that the roots are completely in contact with the soil. After planting, do a good job in nurturing and protecting. (Zheng Ping)

Poplar
Poplar, which can become rafters in four years, pillars in seven years, and beams in ten years, is a common tree species in our country.

There are more than 30 kinds of poplars in our country, the most common ones being Populus tomentosa, Populus simonii, Populus euramericana, Populus cathayana, Populus euphratica, Populus davidiana, Canadian Poplar, and American Poplar. They are widely distributed in more than 20 provinces (regions) in Northeast, Northwest, North China, Southwest, and Central China, from plains to high mountains at an altitude of 3,000 meters. Its general characteristic is that it likes to grow in places with sufficient water and sunlight, but some tree species such as Populus davidiana and Populus alba are not afraid of severe cold; Populus euphratica can tolerate saline-alkali; Populus simonii can be planted in windy and sandy areas; and Populus euramericana can grow in low-lying, damp areas.

Poplar wood can be used as various materials for construction, mine pillars, packaging, utensils, plywood, matchsticks, and wood paper, and can also be used as the best raw material for papermaking and rayon, wool, silk, and satin.

The planting method of poplar that is most widely used in various places is cutting planting. Branches are cut from large trees, inserted into the soil for three to five inches, and then watered and managed regularly to make them survive. Although this method is simple and easy, its adaptability and resistance to pests and diseases are weak, and its lifespan is short. After 20 or 30 years, it will dry out. What needs to be vigorously promoted is cultivating seedlings from seeds for planting. However, poplar trees are dioecious, with small seeds and a short maturity period, so seed collection and seedling cultivation require meticulous and timely work. Although there are these difficulties, as long as you can be patient in the spring when the poplar trees are blooming, these techniques can be learned quickly. (Yu)

Willow
As the saying goes, "Intentional planting of flowers may not bloom, but unintentional planting of willows will create shade." Indeed, if anyone intends to plant willows, they can quickly grow into a large area. One hectare of nursery can cultivate 100,000 to 200,000 seedlings. After planting, not much care is required. After only two or three years, branches can be cut for use, and willow wood can be used in about ten years.

Sowing, cuttings, burying stems, layering and other methods can be used to plant willows. Generally, the last three methods are mostly used for scattered planting.

In spring, before the willow buds have opened, use one- or two-year-old branches, cut into lengths of about one foot to one and a half feet, and insert them into the pits. When inserting, keep the buds facing upwards and determine the insertion method according to the soil moisture and local rainfall. If inserted in wet soil, the tip of the branch should be four or five inches above the ground; if inserted in dry soil, the branch should be inserted into the pit completely, about one inch lower than the ground. In cold areas, it is advisable to insert it obliquely into the soil, and in general, it can be inserted straight.

The method of burying stems is: put one- or two-year-old branches, large and small ends connected, bury them in a ditch, cover them with three or four inches of sandy soil, and then tamp them down.

Bend the willow branch to the ground, bury it about four or five inches deep, press it firmly with soil, and slightly expose the end of the branch, then cut it off to become two plants. This is the layering method. (Chen)

Castor Bean
Castor bean, with its straight stem and large leaves, is not only beautiful and pleasing to the eye, but also has many uses. Castor oil extracted from castor beans is a raw material for many industrial oils. In medicine, castor oil is also a very good laxative. Castor bean stems and seed husks can also be used as fuel and fertilizer, and castor bean leaves can be used to feed silkworms. If you plant it in front of your house, it will not only green the environment, but also increase wealth for the country.

Castor bean is very adaptable. Whether it is fertile farmland or barren soil, as long as the drainage is good, it can generally grow. Of course, if it is fertile clay soil, castor bean will grow better. When cultivating, it is best to apply some human manure, barnyard manure, or plant ash and other fertilizers.

For large-scale planting of castor bean, attention should be paid to deep plowing and shallow planting. Before sowing, loosen the soil to about six or seven inches, and the hole depth should be about two inches. After putting the seeds into the hole, cover them with soil. For scattered planting, you can dig holes directly. The holes should be dug about one foot deep, and then spread a small hole more than two inches deep in the hole, put in three or four seeds, and then cover with soil.

When the castor bean seedlings grow three or four true leaves, thin the seedlings. When the seedlings grow to seven or eight inches, the seedlings should be fixed, leaving only one well-growing plant in each hole. After fixing the seedlings, remove about one inch of the bud tip of the seedlings, which will allow them to grow more branches and more flower spikes. When the seedlings grow to about one foot and have flower buds, applying some top dressing fertilizer will make the flowers and fruits grow very large. (Xiao)

    给祖国大地披上花衣翠袄
    ——关于绿化的一些小知识
    绿，绿色的树木，谁见了它们不心旷神怡，生意盎然？绿，是大自然的赐予，也是人类劳动的创造。在我们祖国各地已经掀起了绿化植树的高潮，千万双手正在那里插杨、栽柳、种蓖麻……这不仅是为了使我们的生活环境更加清新舒适，也为的是让这美丽的大自然更好地为我们的生产大跃进服务。
    树木、森林，它可以防旱涝，挡风沙，保持水土，使肥沃的土壤免于干燥或变成沙荒。它是工业的原料，也是民需的用材。让我们大家都来植树吧。下面是几种值得推广的树木和简易的种植方法。
    洋槐
    洋槐又叫刺槐。它很喜欢阳光，能耐干旱瘠薄的土壤，但不耐水湿。洋槐的萌芽力强，能固土保水，防止水土冲刷。它的根部有根瘤菌，能增加土壤中的氮肥，对改良土壤很有好处。适于在沙荒、黄土丘陵以及地势较低的荒山地区造林。
    洋槐木材材质坚硬、纹理细致、不易开裂、不怕水湿、不易腐烂，可做枕木、矿柱、电杆、桥梁等用。树皮是造纸、编织粗布和网子的原料；树叶可做饲料和肥料；还可代替茶叶饮用。洋槐花能制香水。华北一带农民常采用这种花来掺拌在面粉中蒸馒头吃。
    沿铁路公路地区栽植洋槐，能迅速地保护路基，又能供给枕木、电杆材。在公园、工厂、学校、机关、住宅和道路两旁种植洋槐，花香叶茂，可以达到绿化和香化的目的。洋槐有刺，驴马等牲畜不喜啃食，可避免牲畜侵害。洋槐的繁殖方法，最好是育苗造林，也可用切根造林。至于直播造林，因种子发芽较慢，出苗后又难保护，一般不提倡这种方法。
                                （王朝云）
    臭椿
    臭椿树又名樗树。臭椿生长迅速，具有抗旱、抗碱能力，特别是抗烟和抗病虫害的能力强。在多烟尘地区，许多树种不适宜生长，唯有臭椿树能生长正常。因此臭椿是工矿和多烟尘地区造林的好树种，同时也适宜栽培在路旁或庭园里。
    臭椿木材的用途很广，不但能作建筑和家具的用材，而且是优良的造纸原料。臭椿的根叶，还可以治痢疾、疮疥风疽、疳虫及止血等。在山东等地，群众还用臭椿叶饲养樗蚕，樗蚕丝织物与柞蚕丝类似。
    臭椿适于早春三月播种育苗。造林地适宜在土壤疏松的坡地，在瘠薄干燥或地力衰退但土壤还疏松的荒山也能生长，只是在粘土地生长不好。又因臭椿根部发达，萌蘖力很强，可以进行分根繁殖。　（都蕙芙）
    香椿
    香椿是一种绿化四旁的优良树种。它在气候、土壤适宜的地方，一般一年生的树苗，就可长到四、五尺高。它的木材可与楠木、樟树、檫树等珍贵树种媲美；材色鲜艳，人们爱用它作比较好的家具。我国除东北和其他比较寒冷的地方外，几乎各地都有香椿树。香椿在春天刚抽出的嫩芽，有特殊的香味，叫做椿芽，可供食用。
    香椿成片造林，必须选择肥沃和湿润的土壤。栽植方法有两种：一种是分根法。在大树的附近，常有从根萌蘖出来的幼苗。分根法就是掘取这种小苗进行栽植。不过这种办法不能得取大量的苗木，栽植后成活率也不高。
    一种是采种育苗栽植法。这种方法就是在香椿母树上采取种子，将种子培育成苗木来栽植。香椿果实一般在十月上旬成熟。采下的果实，应放在通风干燥和没有烟熏的地方，等来年春天播种育苗之用。香椿育苗，在播种前要进行细致的整地，施下足够的基肥。播种时复土不要太厚，只要看不到种子就行了。播种后，要常浇水，使土壤经常保持湿润。发芽后，要及时作好间苗，中耕除草，抗旱防涝和病虫害防治等工作。这样，到秋天以后，就可用作造林了。栽植前，要先整地。栽植时，不可使苗根弯曲缠绕，复土要紧，使根与土壤完全密接。栽植后更要作好抚育保护工作。　（正平）
    杨树
    四年椽子、七年柱，十年便成檩梁材的杨树，是我国常见的一个树种。
    我国的杨树有三十多种，最多的有毛白杨、小叶杨、钻天杨、大青杨、胡杨、山杨、加拿大杨、美杨等。分布广及于东北、西北、华北、西南、华中等地区二十多个省（区），从平原到海拔三千公尺的高山都有生长。它的一般特性是喜欢生长在水分和阳光比较充足的地方，但是也有些树种如山杨、银白杨不怕严寒；胡杨能耐盐碱；小叶杨可以栽在风沙地区；钻天杨可以生长在低湿的洼地上。
    杨树的木材既可作为建筑、矿柱、包装、用具、胶合板、火柴杆、木纸等各种用材，又可作为造纸和人造棉、毛、丝、绸的最好原料。
    杨树的种植方法，目前各地运用最广泛的是插条栽植。在大树上砍取枝条，插入土中三至五寸，以后经常浇水管理，就可成活。这种方法，虽简便容易，但适应性和抵抗病虫害的能力弱，寿命短，二、三十年以后就要干梢。要大力推广的是培育实生苗用来进行栽植。但杨树是雌雄异株，种粒小，成熟期短，采种育苗工作要求细致而及时。虽然有这些困难，只要能够在春季杨树开花时，耐心地进行，这些技术可以很快学会。　（瑜）
    柳树
    俗话说“有意栽花花不发，无心插柳柳成荫”。的确，如果谁有心去插柳，很快就可以长成一大片。一公顷苗圃可育成十万至二十万株幼苗。栽植后，又不需要很多的护理工作。只要两三年，便可截取枝条使用，取用柳木，也不过十年左右。
    播种、插条、埋干、压条等办法，都可以种植柳树。一般零星种植，多采用后面三种方法。
    春季，柳树芽苞未开放前，用一二年生的枝条，截成一尺到一尺半左右长短，插入坑内。插时，将芽苞朝上，并且根据土壤干湿程度和各地雨量情况决定插入方法。如插在水湿地，应将枝条尖端高出地面四、五寸；插在干地，应把枝条全部插入坑内，约比地面低一寸左右。在寒冷地宜斜插土中，一般的可直插。
    埋干的方法是：把一二年生枝，大小头相接，埋沟中，上面盖上沙土三、四寸，然后踩实。
    将柳枝弯至地下，深埋四、五寸左右，用土压实，稍露枝端，以后剪断，便成两株。这就是压条法。　（晨）
    蓖麻
    蓖麻，那挺直的茎干和宽大的叶子，不仅美观悦目，而且用处很多。蓖麻籽榨出的蓖麻油，是许多工业用油的原料。在医药上，蓖麻油还是一种很好的缓泻剂。蓖麻的茎干和种子的壳，还可以作燃料和肥料，蓖麻叶可以喂蚕。如果在庭前屋后种上它，不但绿化了环境，也能替国家增加财富。
    蓖麻的适应性很强，不管是肥沃的田地或是瘦瘠的土壤，只要排水良好，一般都能生长。当然，如果是肥沃的粘质土壤，蓖麻就能长得更好。在栽培时，最好能施一些人粪、厩肥，或草木灰等肥料。
    大片种植蓖麻，应注意深耕浅种。播种前，将土翻松约六、七寸，窝深约二寸。窝内放入种子后即将土盖上。零星种植，可直接挖窝。应该把窝挖到一尺左右深，然后再在窝中铺上二寸多深的小窝，放入三、四粒种子，再用土盖上。
    当蓖麻幼苗长出三、四片真叶时，就间苗。等苗长到七、八寸时，就要定苗，每窝只留生长得好的一株。定苗后，将苗子的芽尖摘去约一寸，就能多生分枝、多长花穗。苗长到一尺左右和长花蕾时，如果施一些追肥，花果都会长得很大。　（晓）
