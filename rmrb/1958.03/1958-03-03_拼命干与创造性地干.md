Strenuous Work and Creative Work
    Yao Shifu

    At the Third Session of the Sixth Enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the slogan "Work Hard, Work Practically, and Work Creatively" was put forward, and this slogan replaced the previously proposed slogan of "Work Hard, Work Practically, and Work Madly."

    Changing "Work Madly" to "Work Creatively" is a very significant change. It signifies two different working methods and working styles. The common spirit of these two slogans is: to despise difficulties strategically and to bring revolutionary vigor to resolutely complete tasks. However, in terms of the method of completing tasks, the latter slogan is more positive and more revolutionary than the former.

    It should be admitted that the slogan of working madly was very stimulating in the early stages of the movement for those who were full of endless worries, conservative and backward ideas, and it did indeed serve as a wake-up call for some cadres and Communist Party members who were wearing leather shoes and leading production in the fields. However, applying this slogan universally to the masses can easily lead to some malpractices. In many places, the serious phenomenon of "night battles like Ma Chao" has been discovered, resulting in excessive waste of people's labor. On cold winter nights, this agricultural cooperative and that agricultural cooperative challenged each other on water conservancy construction sites. If you don't rest, I won't rest either; if you don't turn off the lights, I won't turn them off either, so that a laborer has to work more than fourteen hours a day in one breath; some even reach about twenty hours. The enthusiasm of the masses is commendable, but this kind of energy is difficult to sustain. In other places, commune members put forward the bold statement of "demanding grain from the palms of their hands," working shirtless, doing water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements of "letting the river water give way, and letting the river mud go to the fields." However, they still only used simple tools, carrying poles and iron shovels, with dozens or hundreds of people huddled together in a small place unable to stretch out, resulting in great labor intensity and low engineering efficiency.

    What methods should be used to solve these difficulties and problems on the road forward? There is only one way out: to carry out creative labor.

    According to the Xinhua Daily, in Yongning Township, Jiangpu County, at first everyone worked more than fourteen hours a day, but the average person in the township could not complete two cubic meters of earth per day. At this work efficiency, to complete the originally planned one million cubic meters of water conservancy tasks, they would have to keep carrying earth until March or April. Some people began to lose confidence and asked to reduce the task. The Yongning Township Party Committee promptly organized the masses to discuss: "Is this year's water management a major or minor effort? How should it be done?" As a result of the discussion, everyone came up with many ways to improve tools and increase efficiency. The sixth revision of the winter and spring water conservancy plan determined to do two million cubic meters of earthwork, equivalent to four times the total water conservancy projects since liberation. They changed the manure baskets that held 120 catties of earth to baskets that could hold 160 catties of earth, and removed the wheels from the double-wheeled double-shared plow and converted them into earth-carrying vehicles, which increased work efficiency by three or four times. Later, some people used flatbed carts and converted ox carts, and improved tools such as sliding screws, which increased work efficiency by more than five times. In this way, the township averaged eight cubic meters of earth per person per day. Several agricultural cooperatives in the township completed twelve cubic meters per person per day, and the highest-achieving youth commando team could do twenty cubic meters of earth per person per day.

    While improving tools, it is also necessary to reasonably adjust the labor organization and eliminate the phenomenon of "everyone rushing around" on the construction site. In the water conservancy project of the Fanshen Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangning County, the phenomenon of wasting labor was widespread. Commune members reflected, "Eels and loaches are the same length, carrying poles and clubs are the same." Later, the cooperative cadres sought the opinions of experienced farmers, assigned tasks to households, established a personal responsibility system, and rationally matched earth carrying and earth digging, so that people were not idle and tools did not stop. The average daily work efficiency of the entire cooperative increased from 1.8 cubic meters to more than 4.5 cubic meters.

    We should calmly look at the situation where completing earthwork tasks is good, but completing more earthwork numbers does not mean that the area of irrigation increases or improves more. Without unified planning and correct engineering specifications, indiscriminate digging will also cause waste of manpower and materials. Dayi Township in Yizheng County mobilized the masses to think of ways, offer ideas, and contribute suggestions. After debate, the masses proposed many good methods, such as replacing manure baskets with Ba Dou ponds, which saved labor, stored more water, were quick to build, and had great benefits. After the advanced experience was promoted, the entire township only needed to do three million cubic meters of earthwork to achieve water conservancy, and doing one cubic meter of earthwork would be equivalent to the benefit of four cubic meters of earthwork. The originally planned task of doing 12 million cubic meters of earthwork in three years to achieve water conservancy can also be completed this year.

    In this high tide of production where ten thousand horses are galloping forward, it is the time for everyone to contribute to socialism, as some cadres in Changshu County said: In the past, things we thought of doing were often not done, but now we are not afraid that the masses cannot do it, but only afraid that the cadres cannot think of it. As the saying goes: three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang. How many Zhuge Liangs should there be in a large country with 600 million people? In our era, if things that are in line with the laws of development are thought of, they can be done. Let us use our brains more, have more creative energy, and use the revolutionary spirit of constantly leaping forward to promote the development of socialist construction!

    Creative labor and work is an excellent quality of all communists! Let every cadre and party member strive to be a red expert who is both red and expert in this vigorous struggle!

    拼命干与创造性地干
    姚世夫
    中共江苏省委三届六次扩大会议上，提出了“苦干、实干、创造性地干”的口号，并且以这一口号，代替了过去曾经提出过的“苦干、实干、拼命地干”的口号。
    “拼命地干”改成“创造性地干”，这一改，是非常有意义的。它标志着两种不同的工作方法和工作作风。这两个口号的共同精神是：在战略上藐视困难，拿出革命的干劲来坚决完成任务。但在完成任务的方法上，后一个口号就比前一个口号更积极、更富有革命气息了。
    应该承认拼命地干的口号在运动初期对于那些充满无穷忧虑保守落后的思想的人是很有刺激性的，对于某些穿着皮鞋下田领导生产的干部和共产党员来说，也确实起到了敲起警钟的作用。然而，把这个口号普遍用之于群众，就很容易发生一些流弊。不少地方已经发现了严重的“夜战马超”的现象，造成了民力过多的浪费。在数九寒冬的夜晚，这个农业社和那个农业社，在水利工地上互相挑战。你不休息，我也不休息，你不熄灯我也不熄灯，以至一个劳动力每天一气要干十四小时以上；有的甚至达到二十小时左右。群众的干劲是难能可贵的，但这种劲头却很难持久。还有的地方，社员们提出“向手掌心要粮”的豪语，打着赤膊，干着“让河水让路，让河泥上田”的水利、积肥运动。可是他们使用的仍然只是简单的工具，罗担和铁锹，几十成百的人窝在一块小地方施展不开，结果，劳动强度很大，工程效率不高。
    用什么办法来解决这些前进道路中的困难和问题呢？出路只有一条：就是要进行创造性的劳动。
    据新华日报报道：江浦县永宁乡起初每天每人上工的时间在十四小时以上，可是全乡平均每人一天做不到二方土，以这个工效，要完成原订的一百万方的水利任务就要不停地挑土，一直挑到三、四月份。有些人开始失去信心了，要求缩减任务。永宁乡党委及时组织群众讨论：“今年治水是大治？还是小治？怎么来治？”讨论结果，大家想出许多改进工具、提高效率的办法，第六次修改冬春水利规划，决心要做二百万土方，等于解放以来水利工程总和的四倍。他们把盛土一百二十斤的粪箕改用能盛土一百六十斤的筐箕，又卸下双轮双铧犁的轮子，改装成运土车，工作效率就提高了三、四倍。以后又有人使用板车和改装牛车，改进滑镙等工具，使工作效率提高了五倍以上。这样全乡平均每人每天都可以做到八方土。这个乡的好几个农业社每天每人做到十二方，最高的一个青年突击队，每人每天可做二十方土。
    与改进工具的同时，还要合理地调整劳动组织，消灭工地上的一窝蜂大呼?的现象。江宁县翻身农业社的水利工程，普遍发生窝工浪费的现象，社员反映：“黄鳝、泥鳅一样长，扁担、棒棰算一样。”以后社干部征求了老农的意见，把任务分配到户，建立了个人负责制，挑土挖土合理搭配，做到人不闲、工具不停，全社劳力平均每天工效由一点八方提高到四方半以上。
    应该冷静的看待这样一种情况：完成土方任务是好的，但完成土方数字愈多并不等于增加或改善灌溉的面积愈多，如果没有统一的规划和正确的工程规格，乱挖一通，也会造成人力物力的浪费现象。仪征县大仪乡动员群众想办法、出主意、献计策，经过辩论，群众提出以巴斗塘代替粪箕等许多花工省、蓄水多、工程快、收效大的好办法，先进经验推广后，全乡只要做三百万土方就可以实现水利化，做一方土就抵四方土的效益，原订三年做一千二百万方土实现水利化的任务也可以提前于今年完成。
    在这万马奔腾飞跃前进的生产高潮里，正是人人对社会主义拿出贡献的时候，正如常熟县的一些干部所说：过去我们想到要做的事往往做不到，现在是不怕群众做不到，只怕干部想不到。俗话说：三个臭皮匠合个诸葛亮，六亿人口的大国，该有多少诸葛亮啊？在我们这个时代，如果合乎事物发展规律的事情，想得到的事就做得到。让我们多动脑筋想想，多一些创造性的干劲，以不断向前跃进的革命精神，来推动社会主义建设的发展吧！
    创造性地劳动和工作，是一切共产党人的优秀品质！让我们每一个干部和党员都在这一场轰轰烈烈的斗争中争取做一个又红又专的红色专家！
