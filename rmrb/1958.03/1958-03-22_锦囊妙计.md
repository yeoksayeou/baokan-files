Currently, almost all factories and mines have established great leap forward plans. Some aim to increase production by half, some by double, and some even by three or five times. To achieve these plans, various difficulties will inevitably arise. Problems concerning manpower, equipment, and funding await solutions.

	Asking for help from above will likely be in vain eight or nine times out of ten. Seeking external assistance is also unlikely due to everyone being under pressure. What to do? It's not difficult. Just accomplish these seven words: rely on the masses to find solutions.

	Some enterprise leaders might say: Your method is too old-fashioned.

	Then, please read the news about the Beijing Qilian Iron Wire Factory! The leaders of this factory regretfully and emotionally said: "If we had consulted with the workers earlier, the problem would have been solved sooner!" Can you guarantee that you will never say such a thing?

	It seems that although the method is old, it is still a universally effective "wonderful plan."

    锦囊妙计
    目前，各个厂矿差不多都已经定出了跃进计划。有的要增产半倍，有的要增产一倍，有的还增产三倍、五倍……。要实现这些计划，总会碰到一些困难。人力问题，设备问题，资金问题等这样那样问题，都等着人们去解决。
    伸手向上面要吧，十有八成是要不来的。求外援吧，大家都很紧张，可能性也不大。怎么办？也不难。只要作到七个字就行。这七个字就是：依靠群众想办法。
    有的企业的领导同志会说：你们这个办法太老一套了。
    那末，请读读北京企联铁丝厂的消息吧！这个厂的领导人员又后悔又感慨地说：“早和工人们商量，问题就早解决了！”你能保证自己永远不说这样的话吗？
    看来，办法虽老，却仍是万能的“锦囊妙计”。
