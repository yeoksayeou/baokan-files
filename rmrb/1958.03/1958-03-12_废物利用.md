    Waste Utilization
    During the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, the workers of the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory proposed to utilize waste materials by mending old work clothes and broken rubber shoes and issuing them to the workers again. In this way, each workshop can save the country nearly 2,000 yuan a year. This is the amateur workshop sewing group, organized by the Communist Youth League members of the printing and dyeing workshop, at work.

    废物利用
    在反浪费反保守运动中，上海第二棉纺厂的职工提出要利用废物，把破旧的工作服、破胶鞋进行缝补，再发给工人们穿。这样，每个工场一年就可为国家节约近二千元。这是印染工场共青团员们自动组织的业余车间缝补小组正在进行工作。
