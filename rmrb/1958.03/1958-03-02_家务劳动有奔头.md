    Housework Has a Bright Future
    I used to be a statistics worker in the Central Aquatic Products Department. During the rectification movement, after repeated consideration, I happily resigned from my job and returned home to engage in housework.
    The matter of resigning was not something I understood all at once. It was only with the help of the organization and my wife that I gradually figured it out.
    Considering the interests of the country, the bloated organization of many government agencies and the phenomenon of overstaffing are very serious, which increases the country's expenses and prevents everyone from playing their due role. The Party and the state require every cadre to show revolutionary drive, with one person doing the work of two. As an ordinary talent, I felt that I could not play a major role in my job. Considering the heavy household chores, I felt even more that the government's proposal for cadres who are not needed at work, have many children, and are burdened with heavy housework to resign and return home to engage in housework was perfectly suitable for me.
    I did some calculations from an economic point of view: I have six children, and it is simply impossible to manage without a nanny. However, my monthly income is almost equivalent to the cost of hiring a nanny.
    After work, I did not have more energy to educate my children, so they learned some bad habits. I was too busy with my own work to urge and help them with their studies. With many children and many household chores, I was overwhelmed and felt exhausted all day long. Every day, after work, I had to buy groceries and make meals for the children for the next day. The children wore tattered clothes, and I couldn't even find the time to mend them. Therefore, I felt even more that the government's measure of proposing resignation for those who meet the conditions was completely correct, which is beneficial to both the public and the private.
    I used to think that housework had no future and that it was faster to make progress in a job, and that there was no need to worry about illness or anything else, as the public would take care of it anyway. Now I realize that this idea is wrong. The speed of progress mainly depends on oneself. In housework, one can still make progress, train oneself, and improve oneself by taking time to study and paying attention to current affairs. All aspects of the country's work have a bright future, and housework also has a bright future. We must contribute to building a new socialist family.

### 家务劳动有奔头

    家务劳动有奔头
    我原来是中央水产部的一个统计工作人员。在整风运动中，经过反复地思考，已经愉快地退职回家从事家务劳动。
    退职一事，我不是一下子想通了的。经过组织上和我爱人帮助，才逐步搞通了。
    从国家的利益着想，许多机关的机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象十分严重，既增加了国家的开支，又不能发挥每一个人应有的作用。党和国家要求每一个干部拿出革命干劲，一个人能顶二个人用，像我这样一个普通的人才，自己感到留在工作岗位上发挥不了大作用。再从繁重的家庭事务方面考虑，更加感到政府提出工作不太需要、孩子多，家务繁重的干部退职回家从事家务劳动，对我来说是完全适合的。
    我从经济上算了一笔账：我有六个孩子，家里不请保姆简直不行。可是我一个月的收入，差不多和请保姆的钱相抵了。
    工作后我没有更多的精力对孩子进行教育，因此，孩子们学了一些坏习惯。我自己工作上自顾不暇，当然更无法督促和帮助孩子们的学习。孩子多，家务事也多，我顾了东顾不了西，整天感到精疲力竭。每天，我下了班，要买菜回家，给孩子们做好隔天的饭菜，孩子们穿的破破烂烂，连缝补的功夫也抽不出来。因此，我更加感到政府对适合条件的提出退职的措施是完全正确的，这与公与私都有好处。
    我曾经想过，家务劳动没有奔头，还是在工作岗位上进步快，有病有事不用愁，反正有公家照顾。现在认识到这种想法是不对头的。进步快慢主要取决于自己，在家务劳动中，自己抽时间学习，关心时事，同样可以进步，可以锻炼自己，提高自己。国家各方面的工作都有灿烂的前途，家务劳动也有奔头。我们要在建设社会主义新家庭方面出一把力。
