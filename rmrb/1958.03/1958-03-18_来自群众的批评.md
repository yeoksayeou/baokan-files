Criticism from the Masses

    When Calculating Economic Accounts, We Must Also Calculate Ideological Accounts
    I am a statistician. I understand that when compiling the basic construction plan at the beginning of each year, many leading comrades from various units ask the state for excessive investment and equipment. In reality, equipment for many projects fails to be procured each year, leading to stockpiling of funds. The Installation Engineering Team of the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau is one such example. Over the past three years, as many as twenty-five items of instruments and equipment originally listed in the plan have failed to be procured. According to incomplete statistics, the planned investment amounts to more than 100,000 yuan. The failure to purchase these instruments and equipment has not affected construction. On the contrary, many already purchased equipment have not been used even once in recent years. In this anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, while economic accounts should certainly be settled, the ideological accounts that have caused various stockpiles and waste should be thoroughly cleared.

    What Kind of Authority is He Showing Off?
    During the Spring Festival, Hu Gongzou, from the Third Detachment of Unit 0223 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, went home to visit relatives. This comrade wore a "May First" pistol. From the first day of the Lunar New Year to the fourth day, he fired a total of thirty-six shots, causing much discussion among the masses. Some people said, "What position does this comrade hold in the army that he fires guns randomly when he comes to the countryside!" Others said, "He has been in the army for more than eight years. This time when he comes home, he wants to show us his authority!" We understand the purpose of his shooting: first, it was for fun; second, he used the pistol to replace firecrackers; and third, he was hunting. The masses reflected that such a People's Liberation Army soldier is rarely seen.

    算经济账也要算思想账
    我是一个做统计工作的。据了解每年年初编制基本建设计划时，都有许多单位的负责同志，向国家要过多的投资和装备。其实每年都有不少项目的装备，因采购不到而落空，造成资金积压。广播事业局安装工程队就有这样的例子。近三年来，年初列入计划，实际落空的仪器和设备就有二十五项之多。计划投资额据不完全统计即达十万多元。这些仪器和设备没有买到，并没有影响施工，相反有不少已经购置的设备，几年来也没有用过一次。在这次反浪费反保守运动中，经济账固然要算，造成各种积压和浪费的思想账，更应该彻底清算。

    他显的什么威风
    春节时，中国人民解放军零二二三部队三支队的胡功奏回家探亲。该同志身佩一支“五一”手枪，从大年初一到初四，共打了三十六枪，引起群众议论纷纷。有人说，这位同志在部队是个什么官职呀？到农村来乱打枪！有人说，他从参军到现在已经八年多了，这次回家，叫我们看看他的威风呢！我们了解一下他打枪的目的：一是有意好玩，二是用手枪代替鞭炮，三是打猎。群众反映说，这样的解放军真是少见。
