　　Taiyuan Collaboration Conference Creates New Experiences in Comprehensive Collaboration
　　(By our newspaper) The Shanxi Daily reports: Taiyuan City convened a large-scale city-wide industrial production and capital construction collaboration conference from January 24th to February 14th. This conference was held under the new situation of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and on the basis of certain achievements in the anti-conservatism and anti-waste movement in various factories and mines. According to the spirit of fully tapping potential and widely展开ing regional collaboration, the conference organized various factories and mines in the city to展开 mutual support and mutual promotion. It not only made unified arrangements and comprehensive plans for many new problems that have emerged in the current industrial production and capital construction, but also促使 the industrial production and construction plans of various factories and mines this year to leap forward further. Combined with the further development of the anti-conservatism and anti-waste movement in various units throughout the city, it促使 the total industrial output value of the city to leap forward from a pre-conference actual growth rate of over 20% to over 50%. The great leap forward will inevitably lead to great imbalances.
　　This conference was held under the direct leadership of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and hosted by the Municipal People's Committee. Participants included more than 130 units including state-owned and local state-owned industries, capital construction, transportation, handicrafts, commerce, finance, and suburban areas in the city. The leaders and cadres of these units such as factory directors, bureau chiefs, and managers, as well as personnel in charge of labor, raw materials, transportation, and processing orders, totaled more than 500 people. Taiyuan City's industrial production and capital construction tasks this year are unprecedentedly heavy. There are various new products that need to be successfully trial-produced and mass-produced. National key projects in capital construction have all started construction, and they all need to speed up their progress to strive for early completion and commissioning. With this situation, there are varying degrees of tension and difficulty in product manufacturing, raw material supply, labor force, transportation capacity, and technical strength. However, on the other hand, many enterprises have surplus manpower and technical strength, stockpiled stagnant materials, and surplus machinery and equipment that have not been fully utilized. This phenomenon of one side lacking and the other side having a surplus has existed in the past, but it is even more prominent in the current situation of a great leap forward in production. At the same time, agriculture in the province is also experiencing a great leap forward, and this situation has put forward many new requirements for industry. The solution to all these problems, of course, mainly depends on the efforts of the enterprises themselves, but it is impossible to imagine that any enterprise can solve all the problems without cooperating with other enterprises. Therefore, unified planning, comprehensive arrangements, and extensive collaboration to fully develop potential forces have urgent practical significance.
　　Although enterprises in the Taiyuan area have engaged in collaboration in the past, in previous years collaboration was only regarded as a measure to solve temporary difficulties. Generally, problems were solved as they arose, and the scope of collaboration was relatively narrow, lacking comprehensive planning and unified arrangements. Obviously, this situation can no longer meet the needs of the current situation, let alone give full play to the superiority of the socialist economy. To this end, the Party and government leading organs of Taiyuan City have determined that this year it is necessary to further strengthen the unified leadership of collaboration, strengthen the planning and regularity of collaboration, strive for the consciousness and initiative of collaboration, and expand the scope of collaboration and take various forms to展开 collaboration. Last winter, the Taiyuan Municipal People's Committee began to investigate the production situation this year. Based on the results of the investigation, it separately drafted balanced plans for unified labor planning, technical force cooperation, raw material allocation and supply, transportation force organization, non-standard equipment processing orders, and agricultural support.
　　After the preparatory work was completed, the city-wide collaboration conference was immediately held. This conference was conducted in two stages, and it was贯穿ed from beginning to end by the spirit of "unifying thinking, fully explaining the bottom line, mutually supporting, and solving practical problems."
　　Treat Collaboration with Socialist Thought
　　The first stage lasted three days, and the participants were the main leading cadres of each unit. First, Comrade Zhao Lizhi, Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, and Comrade Ren Shanzheng, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal People's Committee, made mobilization reports and explanations of several plans respectively. After analyzing the current situation, they pointed out that in order to realize the great call of "catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom in fifteen years," it is necessary to comprehensively make a great leap forward. And they called on everyone to proceed from the overall concept, eliminate conservative ideas and departmentalism, strengthen collaboration, and tap their own potential in every possible way with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, and support each other. And it is required that each unit reconsider the specific plans for its own labor force, raw materials, transportation tools, etc. according to the spirit of the conference.
　　After the units separately conveyed and酝酿ed to relevant personnel, a general discussion was held. The comrades attending the meeting spoke enthusiastically and were in high spirits. In their speeches, all the comrades unanimously expressed their support for the various plans put forward at the conference. Some comrades also criticized the municipal-level leading organs for failing to better organize comprehensive collaboration in the past; at the same time, they also took the initiative to examine the negative emotions and erroneous attitudes that their units had in the past in terms of collaboration. Such as "fear of suffering losses," "dislike of trouble," "holding back," and relying solely on external support, "舍近求远" and other wrong attitudes and ideas. Mutual criticism and self-criticism also展开ed between units. For example, the responsible cadre of a certain factory checked the untrustworthy behavior in foreign cooperation in the past at the meeting, and resolutely stated that from today on, they will use practical actions to "restore reputation." Various units also announced their own leap forward plans, and actively proposed matters that could help others and difficulties that urgently needed help to overcome. In order to make it easier for the attendees to make collaboration requests to themselves, the speakers took the initiative to摆 own their "family property," publicly inventory all materials, and allow everyone to allocate and use them. Comrades from Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, Shanxi Machine Tool Plant and others expressed that they would "open up" some special equipment that other units in the plant did not have for everyone to use. Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant and more than a dozen other local state-owned and joint state-private machine factories expressed that they are not afraid of small workloads or trouble, and will undertake the production of non-standard equipment for key construction departments. Many comrades also took the initiative to reduce their required figures for labor or other aspects. A responsible comrade from a newly built factory stated that he only had a few extra barber workers, and also requested to be assigned to units in need. In the speeches, a heated discussion was held on the "扯皮 phenomenon" that has long existed between the A and B parties in terms of capital construction, especially the B party's pure pursuit of workload and neglect of the ending projects, thus affecting the A party's inability to put into production early. After Party A successively explained the significance of completing the progress of capital construction projects early in guaranteeing the realization of the production leap forward plan and the growth of the entire national economy, it also reviewed the mistakes of Party A not considering Party B in the past; some leading comrades of engineering units undertaking factory building and installation tasks on the spot expressed their acceptance of Party A’s requirements and loudly proposed to guarantee the completion of engineering tasks on schedule or ahead of schedule so that factories could be put into production as soon as possible. And also checked that the neglect of the ending project in the past was mainly a problem of ideology, not an insurmountable difficulty. In his speech, everyone scrambled to request "sharing the task" of supporting agriculture, expressing that they would rather have some difficulties themselves and squeeze out manpower and materials to support the great leap forward in agriculture. Comrade Li Guoze, director of the Taiyuan Suburb People's Committee, said with great excitement: "We must use the support of each unit in the most urgent places to ensure the completion of the target of a great leap forward of 400 catties per mu." In his speech, the principle proposed by the comrades of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant of "never reaching out to others for anything that can be solved by tapping its own potential; using all its strength to support anything it can support" was unanimously approved by the meeting. The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of "it is glorious to support others, and departmentalism is shameful," sweeping away some of the "bargaining"扯皮 phenomena that often occurred at past collaboration meetings.
　　Broke through the mechanical comprehensive balance method according to条条
　　Mass collaboration methods are lively, active and diverse
　　The second stage of the conference focused on solving various practical problems on the basis of unified thinking. The Municipal People's Committee absorbed the business personnel in charge of each unit and convened various professional meetings. In the professional meetings, combined with the discussion of the pre-prepared plans, the specific requirements put forward by everyone were solved, such as labor force planning, mechanical processing orders, material allocation, transportation force organization, and so on. This series of meetings took small-scale, diverse, lively and active forms. At each professional meeting, after introducing each other's situation and requirements, first of all, they actively found each other's collaboration objects in groups of three or five, and many units reached agreements on the spot or quickly signed contracts. Only problems that are not easy to solve for each other are submitted to the Municipal People's Committee for further arrangements.
　　Extensive regional collaboration展开ed by factories and mining enterprises in Taiyuan area has achieved remarkable results. The difficult problems originally existing in large enterprises or small factories have been solved to varying degrees. For example, a month ago, the components that some key construction factories and mines wanted others to process had not yet been settled; however, some small and medium-sized factories in this area were contracting tasks everywhere. At the processing order meeting, according to the principle of "processing locally if it can be processed locally" proposed at the conference, nearly 10,000 tons of steel components, pipeline processing and other ordering agreements were reached with each other. This not only met the requirements of some key units and avoided the waste of processing in other places; it also supplemented the insufficient tasks of local small factories, making the production leap forward plans of each other based on a reliable material basis. For example, Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, which is accelerating construction, originally planned to take more than 3,000 tons of non-standard castings this year to be processed in other places; now 67% of the processing tasks have found processing objects locally. Because this factory does not have to "舍近求远" anymore, it saves 180,000 yuan in freight alone. At the same time, it is also guaranteed to speed up the project progress and put into production early. At the beginning of the year, many local state-owned and joint state-private machine factories in Taiyuan area only arranged the workload for the second and third quarters due to insufficient raw materials and unclear tasks; but after these factories undertook the processing work of local key factories and mines, the newly added workload was equivalent to 30%-40% of the current annual task, fundamentally reversing the situation of "not being full," and also promoted these factories to stride towards the leap forward.
　　When the Taiyuan Municipal People's Committee comprehensively balanced this batch of processing components, it made reasonable allocations according to the differences in equipment capacity and technical level of each factory: precise and complex machinery and components were contracted by large machine factories, and simpler ones were processed by small factories. In this way, the unique roles of large, medium, and small enterprises were fully发挥ed. With the gradual stabilization of the cooperative relationship between local factories and state-owned factories, the发挥 of the role of small and medium-sized factories will be more rationally configured. Now, the numerous local small factories in Taiyuan area have initially formed "satellite factories" serving large factories and key construction units.
　 The Collaboration Conference that learns from advanced and catches up with the advanced has played a promoting role
　　The Taiyuan area collaboration conference has also become a conference to promote the high tide of industrial production in the city. The leading cadres attending the meeting were full of the enthusiasm of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced." For example, in order to solve the shortage of transportation capacity in the city, all units deeply felt that the utilization rate of trucks in various factories and mines was too low. Some units only drove 400 tons per kilometer per month, which was too far from the transportation company's efficiency of 1,300 tons per kilometer. Therefore, they successively proposed to increase their driving rate to the advanced level of the transportation company. However, the transportation company was not willing to stay at the existing level, and further proposed to strive to increase the efficiency of truck transportation to more than 1,700 tons per kilometer in the shortest possible time. This atmosphere of using the method of learning from the advanced to tap potential is filled with the entire conference.
　　Through comprehensive balancing and collaboration in terms of labor force and state allocation materials, the potential strength of Taiyuan area's industry has been further发挥ed. For example, 18 units including the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Construction Engineering Department allocated their surplus or temporarily unused steel and cement to 13 units with insufficient supply, making full use of stagnant materials. For example, Taiyuan Iron Factory exchanged its long-term backlog of 59 tons of steel with other units, and exchanged back steel plates and bearings urgently needed for current production. The potential of equipment in various factories and mines has also been fully发挥ed. In order to adapt to the characteristics of the heavy task of manufacturing new products in the machine industry in Taiyuan area this year, some heavy and large machine factories have determined the principle of "people stop, machines do not stop," so that the utilization rate of the city's few special machinery equipment is increased to the maximum limit. In terms of labor force planning, each enterprise follows the principle of "old factories increasing production without increasing people, and new factories increasing people by allocating from old factories," and allocates more than 2,000 technicians from units with窝工 or less workload to newly built units. Many units have also changed the illegal practice of blindly recruiting temporary workers from rural areas in the past, and obeyed the unified balance of the city. According to the preliminary balance at this conference alone, more than 14,000 laborers can be recruited from the society this year. If calculated at an average annual salary of 300 yuan per worker, the state can pay 4.22 million yuan less. At present, in terms of labor force use, adjustments are continuing to be made in accordance with the spirit of strict control and unified planning.
　　Because the collaboration conference further clarified the surplus and shortage of manpower and various materials in the city, it further enhanced the planning of the city's leading departments in organizing industrial and capital construction collaboration in the city. Each enterprise department and production unit can also arrange their own production and construction tasks with more "understanding." At the meeting, many units revised their original plans that were not very practical from the perspective of overall needs. When everyone knew that the city's transportation capacity was surplus in spring and winter, but insufficient in summer and autumn, they successively proposed to transport the materials originally planned to be transported in the second and third quarters as early as possible. This greatly changed the unbalanced situation of "loose at both ends and tight in the middle" that has always existed. Many local state-owned factories and handicraft cooperatives further clarified their business directions and proposed to mobilize all forces to concentrate on producing the varieties most needed by state-owned factories and construction departments. For example, the local building materials department clarified that this year, with the increase in the workload of railway branch lines and factory foundation projects, the demand for stone has increased sharply, so it appropriately compressed the production of bricks and tiles and produced more building materials such as stone slag, quartz sand, and rubble. For another example, in terms of local industrial investment, the Municipal People's Committee also revised the original use plan and concentrated the limited funds to places where they are urgently needed. It has now been determined: to build new quartz sand factories, acid-resistant ceramic factories, etc., and appropriately expand the city-owned industrial parts needed by agriculture and large factories.
　　At the collaboration conference, the Taiyuan suburban rural areas requested industrial assistance in solving the technical difficulties of repairing farm tools and various equipment and equipment such as steel, cement, electric motors, water pumps, and cables, and satisfactory results were obtained. Taiyuan City's factories and mines have now dispatched more than 600 technicians and workers to the countryside to help farmers repair agricultural machinery, and are further clearing out the surplus equipment and materials needed by the rural areas. Many factories and mines have established a relatively regular contact system with rural areas. Recently, Taiyuan City has also formulated a comprehensive plan to exploit all the potential forces of Taiyuan Industrial Base to support the great leap forward in agriculture and county-run industry in the province, and will soon put it into practice.
　　Through this grand collaboration conference, a good foundation has been laid for future Taiyuan factories and mining enterprises to exchange information and further展开 long-term and more extensive collaboration. Now, more than 80 production factories, mines, and capital construction units in the city have automatically established relatively fixed cooperative relationships. Therefore, the leading organs in charge of planning and collaboration have also reduced many daily tasks and can free up their hands to go deep into the grassroots to inspect and help work. At the same time, the scope of collaboration is now not only limited to the industrial and capital construction units, but further extended to the agricultural and commercial aspects. At present, some commercial departments have taken the initiative to deliver the goods needed by the factories and mines to the door, and plan to organize sources of goods for industrial production. With the expansion of the scope of collaboration, the content of collaboration will also be more rich and colorful.
　　Collaboration is the most powerful way to anti-conservatism and anti-waste
　　Comrade Li Qi, First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Ma Guishu, Secretary of the Secretariat, attended the conference and made speeches during the conference. In their speeches, they all pointed out that the above-mentioned great achievements of this city-wide collaboration conference are the new style and new atmosphere that have emerged after the rectification campaign. Everyone's full cooperation and mutual support will be a powerful guarantee for realizing this year's leap forward plan in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Collaboration is the best and most powerful way to oppose conservatism and oppose waste. And pointed out that this collaboration conference is actually a local plan balancing conference, which is a supplement to the national plan balancing. This collaboration is not only necessary for socialist enterprises, but should also be further expanded to all departments and all aspects. They requested that the leading cadres of various departments and enterprise units should not be satisfied with the existing achievements, and should continue to展开 regular struggles against departmentalism. At the same time, collaboration should be formed into a fixed and regular system to further communicate mutual relations and make collaboration continue to develop.
　　It is reported that Taiyuan City's party and government leading organs are preparing to further organize collaboration between cultural and educational departments and industry, etc., in addition to convening professional meetings on technical force cooperation in the near future; they will also further organize the city's industrial and other forces to support the great leap forward in agriculture and local industry in the province. It can be affirmed that the further development of regional collaboration in Taiyuan area will more powerfully mobilize all manpower and material resources in the city, promote the great leap forward in all walks of life, and will certainly receive greater results.

    同心协力　万马齐奔
    太原协作会议创造全面协作的新经验
    本报讯　山西日报报道：太原市从1月24日至2月14日召开了全市规模的巨大的工业生产、基本建设协作会议。这次会议是在工业农业生产出现大跃进的新形势下召开的，而且是在各厂矿企业反保守、反浪费运动获得一定成效的基础上召开的。会议根据充分挖掘潜力、广泛展开地区性协作的精神，把全市各厂矿组织起来，展开互相支援，互相促进，不仅对当前工业生产、基本建设中出现了的许多新问题做了统一安排和全面规划，而且促使今年各厂矿的工业生产、建设计划更向前跃进一步，再加全市各单位的反保守反浪费运动的进一步发展，促使全市工业生产总值比1957年实际增长率由会前的20％以上再跃进到50％以上。大跃进必然出现大不平衡
    这次会议是在中共太原市委直接领导下，由市人民委员会主持召开的。参加者有全市国营、地方国营工业、基本建设、交通运输、手工业、商业、金融部门以及郊区等一百三十多个单位的厂长、局长、经理等领导干部和这些单位掌管劳动力、原材料、运输工具和加工定货等业务人员，共五百余人。太原市今年工业生产、基本建设任务空前繁重。有多种新产品要求试制成功和成批生产。基本建设的国家重点工程，均已普遍开工，并且都要加快速度争取提前竣工和投入生产。随着这种形势，无论在产品制造、原材料供应、劳动力、运输力、技术力量等方面，都存在着不同程度的紧张和困难。但另一方面，不少企业却又有多余的人力和技术力量、积压的呆滞物资、剩余的机器设备等，没有被充分利用起来。这种一面不足，一面剩余的现象，过去也存在着，但是在目前生产大跃进的形势下就暴露得更为突出。同时，全省农业也在大跃进，这种形势向工业方面提出了很多新的要求。所有这些问题的解决，固然主要依靠各企业本身的努力，但不能设想任何一个企业不与其它企业合作，能够解决所有的问题。因此，统一规划、全面安排、广泛协作，以充分发掘潜在力量，便具有迫切的实际意义。
    太原地区企业之间过去虽然也进行协作，但是往年只是把协作当成解决暂时困难的一种措施，一般是遇到什么问题解决什么问题，协作的范围也比较狭小，缺乏全面规划和统一安排。显然，这种情况已不能适应当前形势的需要，更不能充分发挥社会主义经济的优越性。为此，太原市党、政领导机关确定今年必须进一步加强对协作的统一领导，加强协作的计划性、经常性，力争协作的自觉性、主动性，并且扩大协作范围，采取多种形式展开协作。去年冬季，太原市人民委员会即开始对今年生产的情况进行调查，根据摸底结果，分别拟定了劳动力统一规划、技术力量合作、原材料调剂供应、交通运输力量组织、非标准设备加工定货和支援农业等计划平衡方案。
    在准备工作完成以后，立即举行了全市协作会议。这次会议分作两个阶段进行，自始至终贯穿了“统一思想、全面交底、相互支援、解决实际问题”的精神。
    用社会主义思想对待协作
    第一阶段，会期三天，与会人员是各单位主要领导干部。首先由市委工业交通工作部部长赵力之同志和市人民委员会副市长任善征同志，分别做了动员报告和对几个方案的说明。他们在分析了当前形势后，指出，为了能够实现“十五年赶上和超过英国”的伟大号召，必须全面大跃进。并且号召大家从整体观念出发，消除保守思想和本位主义，加强协作，以又多、又快、又好、又省的原则，千方百计挖掘本身潜力，互相支援。并且要求各单位根据会议精神重新考虑本单位已经制定的劳动力、原材料、运输工具等各项需要的具体计划。
    在各单位分头向有关人员进行了传达和酝酿以后，接着就进行大会讨论。到会同志发言踊跃，情绪热烈。在发言中，全体同志一致表示拥护大会上所提出的各项方案，有的同志还对过去市级领导机关未能更好地组织全面协作提出了批评；同时，也主动检查了本单位过去在协作方面存在着的消极情绪和错误态度。如“怕吃亏”、“嫌麻烦”、“留一手”和单纯依靠外地支援“舍近求远”等错误的态度和思想。各单位之间也展开了相互批评和自我批评。如某厂负责干部在会上检查了过去在对外协作中不守信用的行为，坚决表示从今天起要用实际行动来“恢复名誉”。各单位还纷纷宣布自己的跃进计划，主动提出能够帮助别人的事项和急待别人帮助克服的困难。为了能使到会者便于向自己提出协作的要求，发言人都主动表示向大家摆自己的“家底”，公开库存的一切物资，任凭大家调剂选用。太原重型机器厂、山西机床厂等同志表示要把本厂内其他单位所没有的一些特殊设备，“开放”为大家使用。太原矿山机器厂和其它十多个地方国营和公私合营机器厂表示不怕工作量小，不怕麻烦，要为重点建设部门承做非标准设备。还有不少同志主动减少了自己关于劳动力或其他方面要求的数字。有一个新建厂的负责同志表示，他只有几名长余的理发工人，也请求调配给需要的单位。在发言中，关于基本建设方面甲乙方长期存在着的“扯皮现象”，特别是乙方单纯追求工作量，忽视结尾工程，因而影响甲方不能及早投入生产的问题，进行了热烈的讨论。当甲方纷纷说明基本建设工程进度提早完成对保证实现生产跃进计划和整个国民经济增长的意义以后，还检讨了过去甲方不为乙方着想的错误；一些承担厂房建筑和安装任务工程单位的领导同志，当场表示接受甲方的要求，响亮的提出一定保证按期或提前完成工程任务，使工厂能够早日投入生产。并且也检查了过去忽视结尾工程主要是有思想问题，并不是有不可克服的困难。在发言中，大家对支援农业的方案，都争先恐后的要求“分担任务”，表示宁肯自己困难些，也要挤出人力和物资来支援农业大跃进。这些发言使太原市郊区人民委员会主任李国泽同志，以十分兴奋的心情表示：“一定要把各个单位的支援，用在最急需的地方，以保证完成亩产四百斤大跃进的指标”。在发言中，太原钢铁厂同志提出的“凡是自己能够挖掘潜力解决的，决不伸手向别人要；凡是自己能够支援别人的，要用尽一切力量去支援”的原则，获得了大会的一致赞同。整个会场上充满了“支援别人光荣，本位主义可耻”的气氛，一扫过去在协作会议上常常发生的某些“讨价还价”的扯皮现象。
    突破了按条条机械综合的平衡方法
    群众性协作方式生动活泼多种多样
    会议的第二阶段是在统一思想的基础上，着重解决各项实际问题。市人民委员会吸收各单位主管业务的人员，分别召开了各种专业会议。专业会上结合讨论预先拟定的各项方案，具体解决大家提出的要求，如劳动力规划机械加工定货、材料调配、交通运输力量的组织等等。这一系列的会议都采取了小型多样、生动活泼的形式。每次专业会议上，在相互介绍了自己的情况和要求后，首先是三三两两地各自主动找到相互协作的对象，许多单位当场达成协议或很快签订了合同。只有彼此都不好解决的问题，才提交市人民委员会再作安排。
    太原地区各厂矿企业展开广泛的地区性协作，已经获得了显著效果。无论大企业或小工厂原来存在的困难问题都得到了不同程度的解决。如一个月前某些重点建设厂矿要别人加工的构件还没有着落；而本地区有些中、小型工厂却到处承揽任务。在加工定货会议上，各单位根据大会所提出的“本地能加工的，不到外地去加工”的原则，互相达成了近万吨钢铁构件、管道加工等订货协议。这不仅满足了某些重点单位的要求，避免了到外地加工的浪费；同时也补充了地方小厂任务的不足部分，使彼此之间的生产跃进计划都建立在可靠的物质基础之上。如正在加速建设的太原肥料厂原准备把今年的三千余吨非标准铸件拿到外地加工；现在67％的加工任务都在当地找到了加工对象。这个厂因为不必再“舍近求远”，仅运费就节约了十八万元之多。同时，也保证加快了工程进度提早生产。年初，太原地区有许多地方国营和公私合营机器厂因原料不足和任务不明仅安排了二、三季度的工作量；但这些厂承做了当地重点厂矿的加工活以后，新增加的工作量就相当于现在全年任务的30％—40％，根本上扭转了“吃不饱”的局面，而且也促使了这些工厂大步地走向跃进。
    太原市人民委员会在全面平衡这批加工构件时，根据各个厂设备能力和技术水平的差异，作了合理的分配：精密复杂的机械、构件交大型机器厂承做，较简单的让小型工厂加工。这样，充分发挥了大、中、小企业的各自独特的作用。随着地方工厂与国营工厂合作关系的逐步固定，中小型工厂作用的发挥将得到更合理的配置。现在，太原地区众多的地方小型工厂已初步形成为大工厂和重点建设单位服务的“卫星厂”。
  学先进赶先进协作会议起了促进作用
    太原地区的协作会议，也成了促进全市工业生产高涨的会议。与会领导干部都充沛着“学先进、赶先进”的劲头。如为了解决全市运输力量不足，各单位深深感到各厂矿的载重汽车利用率太低，有些单位每辆车每月仅行车四百吨公里，与运输公司一千三百吨公里的效率相差太远。于是纷纷提出要把自己的行车率提高到运输公司的先进水平。但是，运输公司也不甘停留在现有的水平，进一步提出争取于最短期间把汽车运输效率提高到一千七百吨公里以上。这种用学先进办法来挖掘潜力的气氛，充满整个会议。
    经过对劳动力和国家调拨材料等方面的全面平衡协作，进一步发挥了太原地区工业的潜在力量。如建筑工程部太原工程局等十八个单位，把自己多余的或暂时不用的钢材和水泥，调剂给十三个不足的单位，使呆滞的物资得到充分的利用。如太原铁工厂把积压好久的五十九吨钢材和其他单位展开互换，换回了当前生产上急需的钢板和轴承。各厂矿设备的潜力也得到充分发挥。为了适应今年太原地区机器业新产品制造任务繁重的特点，有些重型和大型机器厂确定“人停、机器不闲”的原则，让全市少有的特殊机械设备的利用率提高到最高限度。在劳动力规划上，各个企业遵循着“老厂增产不增人，新厂增人由老厂调剂”的原则，从窝工或工作量不太大的单位调配给新建单位二千余名技工。许多单位也都改变了过去到农村盲目招收临时工的违章作法，服从全市的统一平衡，仅据这次会议上初步平衡，今年就可以从社会上少招用一万四千余名劳力工。如果以每个工人一年平均三百元工资计算，国家即可少付四百二十余万元的支出。目前，在劳动力使用上，正在根据严格控制和统一规划的精神，继续进行调整。
    由于协作会议上进一步摸清了全市人力和各种物资的余缺状况，更增强了市领导部门组织全市工业、基本建设协作的计划性。各企业部门和生产单位也可以更“心中有数”地安排自己的生产和建设任务。在会上，许多单位从整体需要出发，修订了原来不太切合实际的计划。当大家知道全市春冬两季运输力量有余，而夏秋两季却又不足时，纷纷提出把原准备在二、三季度调运的物资，尽量提前运输。这样便大大改变了历来存在的“两头松、中间紧”的不平衡状况。不少地方国营工厂和手工业社进一步明确了经营方向，提出调动一切力量集中生产国营工厂和建设部门最需要的品种。如生产地方建筑材料部门摸清了今年建筑单位随着铁路支线、厂房基础工程的工作量加大，石料需要量剧增的情况，便适当地压缩了砖瓦生产量，多生产石渣、石英砂、片石等建筑材料。又如在地方工业投资方面，市人民委员会也修改了原来的使用方案，将有限的资金集中使用到急迫需要的地方。现在已经确定：新建石英砂厂、耐酸陶瓷厂等，以及适当扩建那些为农业和大工厂所需要的市属工业部分。
    在协作会议上，太原市郊区农村要求工业帮助解决检修农具的技术困难和钢材、水泥、电动机、水泵、电缆等各种器材和设备，都得到了满意的结果。太原市各厂矿现在已经派出六百余名技术人员和工人，下乡帮助农民检修农业机器，并正在进一步清理库存多余的而为农村需要的设备和材料。许多厂矿已经与农村建立了比较经常的联系制度。最近，太原市又根据中共山西省委指示，制定了发掘太原工业基地的一切潜在力量，支援全省农业和县营工业大跃进的全面计划，并且即将付诸实现。
    通过这次盛大的协作会议，为今后太原厂矿企业互通情报，进一步开展长期的、更广泛的协作奠定了良好的基础。现在全市已有八十多个生产厂矿和基本建设单位自动地建立了较固定的协作联系。因此，主管计划和协作的领导机关，也就减少了许多日常的工作，能腾出手来深入基层检查与帮助工作。同时，协作的范围现在已不仅限于工业和基本建设各单位之间，而进一步向农业方面和商业方面扩展，目前有些商业部门已主动将厂矿所需货物送上门去，并有计划地为工业生产组织货源。随着协作范围的扩大，协作内容也将更丰富多彩。
    协作是反保守反浪费最有力的办法
    中共太原市委第一书记李琦同志、书记处书记麻贵书同志出席了这次会议，并在会议期间作了发言。他们在发言中都指出：这次全市协作会议所以取得以上巨大的成果，是整风以后出现的新作风、新气象。大家全力合作，互相支援，将是又多、又快、又好、又省地实现今年跃进计划的有力保证。协作是反对保守反对浪费最好的、最有力的一个办法。并且指出：这次协作会议，实际上是地方计划平衡会议，它是全国计划平衡的补充。这种协作不仅是社会主义企业所必需的，而且还应该进一步扩大到各个部门各个方面去。他们要求各部门和各企业单位的领导干部不要满足于已有的成绩，要继续向本位主义思想去展开经常的斗争。同时要把协作形成固定的、经常的制度，进一步沟通相互间的关系，使协作持续地发展下去。
    据悉，太原市党政领导机关准备在最近除了召开技术力量合作的专业会议外，还将进一步组织文教部门和工业等等方面的协作；还将进一步组织全市的工业等方面的力量为支援全省的农业、地方工业的大跃进而努力。可以肯定，太原地区性协作的进一步发展，将更有力地调动全市一切人力、物力，促进各行各业的大跃进，也必将收到更大的效果。（附图片）
