Taihang Mountains, Xia Zhuang Village
Each Person Plants Over Four Thousand Trees

(Reported by our correspondent Zhan Chao) Xia Zhuang Village, a small mountain village in Nanren Township, Qin County, Shanxi Province, planted a total of 946,050 trees last winter and this spring, including 28,050 fruit trees such as walnuts. Based on the village's total population of 215 people, each person owns an average of more than 4,400 trees, including more than 130 fruit trees such as walnuts, creating an extremely high record in afforestation.

Xia Zhuang Village was originally a very poor mountain village, with 60 households and 215 people scattered in 14 mountain gullies. The village covers an area of 12,000 mu, but only has 910 mu of cultivated land. In the past, apart from the eight walnut trees and forty-odd hawthorns planted sporadically by the villagers, and a young pine forest cultivated in 1952, the mountains were barren everywhere. Soil erosion was very serious, and there were very few avenues for sideline production for the farmers. A folk song described Xia Zhuang at that time: "Red soil ridges and rocky mountains, with a chaotic rocky beach in between; trees don't grow, grass is scarce for cattle and sheep; the mountains are high and the gullies are deep, machines can't climb the slopes; carrying manure makes your eyes pop out, and if you want to marry a wife, she won't come to the mountains!"

In 1955, the Xia Zhuang Village established an agricultural cooperative. At that time, the Communist Party branch proposed a plan to develop the river滩, but it did not receive full support from the masses, and the results were not significant. Seventeen out of more than eighty households felt that there was no future in the mountainous area and simply moved to the plains.

In the winter of 1957, after the rural rectification campaign, the great airing of views, great debates, and the great discussions, the enthusiasm of the masses for building and developing the mountainous areas was unprecedented. Their slogan was: "For Xia Zhuang to become rich, plant trees and afforest!" After careful research and calculation by the cadres and the masses, a plan for developing the mountain economy was formulated, striving to achieve in seven years: "Get 400,000 yuan from the mountains, get 23,000 dan of grain from the water, get 200 mu of farmland from the river滩, and get 100,000 dan of fertilizer from livestock." They also proposed a grand plan for water and soil conservation and afforestation leap forward: "Plant elm trees on Wuli Mountain to prevent wind, plant willows on Liuli River滩, plant walnuts in four gullies and eight places, each gully should yield 100,000 dates, plant pine trees on Ma'an Mountain, and plant 30,000 peppercorn trees on the sunny slopes, graft 5,300 pears in Daomaogou, and plant grapes and apples beside the river." Since then, the people of Xia Zhuang Village have mustered revolutionary spirit, braving the cold winter wind and snow, starting early and working late, marching towards the barren mountains, poor gullies, and chaotic beaches, and have made amazing achievements in less than three months last winter and this spring: (1) The original plan was to complete 3,000 mu of pine trees (600 trees per mu) in four years, but as a result, half of it was completed last winter and this spring—1,500 mu; (2) The plan was to complete 15,000 windbreak elm trees in two years, and 12,000 trees were planted in three months; (3) The plan was to complete 5,000 willow trees in one year, and 6,500 trees were planted in one winter; (4) The plan was to complete 40,000 walnut trees in three years, and 28,000 trees were planted in three months; (5) Fifty pear trees were grafted, and other fruit tree seedlings such as apples and grapes were also basically prepared. After inspection by the agricultural cooperative, the general quality is very good.

In this water and soil conservation and afforestation leap forward, the people of Xia Zhuang Village received strong assistance from several agricultural production cooperatives in the nearby plains. They are now moving forward on the basis of their existing achievements and are actively preparing for spring ploughing. "Radishes in newly cultivated land, scallions in cultivated land." Based on the experience of old farmers, Xia Zhuang Village is adopting the method of intercropping agriculture and forestry this year, sowing early-maturing crops in the rows of seedlings to increase the income of the commune members. It is estimated that grapes will bear fruit in three years, pear trees will bear fruit in five years, and all fruit trees will be harvested in seven years. At that time, the average annual income of each commune member from forestry alone will be 1,700 yuan, greatly exceeding the living standards of local wealthy middle peasants.

Liang Fuqing, a former individual farmer, saw the agricultural cooperative's ambitious afforestation and production movement with his own eyes, and felt that the mountainous area had a bright future. Not only did he dispel his original thoughts of going down to the plains, but he also actively signed up to join the cooperative. (Attached picture)

    太行山上下庄村
    每人栽树四千多棵
    本报讯　记者展潮报道：山西省沁县南仁乡的一个小山庄——下庄村，去冬今春共植树九十四万六千零五十株，其中核桃等果树二万八千零五十株，按照全村二百一十五人平均计算，每人拥有树木四千四百多株，其中核桃等果树一百三十多株，创造了植树造林极高的纪录。
    下庄村原本是一个很穷的山庄，全村六十户、二百一十五口人，分散在十四条山沟里住着；全村面积一万二千亩，耕地只有九百一十亩，过去除了群众零星种植的八株核桃、四十多株沙果和1952年培育的一片松树幼林外，到处是光秃秃的荒山，水土流失的现象十分严重，农民副业生产的门路又很少。有一个歌谣形容那时候的下庄说：“红土圪梁石头山，中间夹道乱石滩，种树树不长，牛羊草又缺，山高沟又多，机器上不了坡，担粪鼓出眼睛蛋，想娶个媳妇她不上山！”
    1955年下庄村成立了农业合作社，当时共产党支部提出整治河滩的计划，没有得到群众的充分支持，收效不大。八十多户人家有十七户感到山区没有前途，干脆搬到平川里去了。
    1957年冬，经过了农村整风大鸣、大争、大辩论，群众建设山区、发展山区的热情空前高涨，他们的口号是：“下庄要富，造林植树。”经过干部和群众仔细地研究、算账，制订了发展山区经济的规划，争取在七年内作到“向山要钱四十万，向水要粮二万三，向滩要田二百亩，向畜要肥十万担。”并且提出了规模宏大的水土保持、植树造林大跃进的计划：“五里山顶防风槐，六里河滩杨柳栽，四沟八处种核桃，半沟要结十万枣，松树种在马鞍山，阳坡共栽三万椒（花椒），道冒沟接梨五千三，葡萄、苹果种河旁。”从此，下庄村人民鼓起革命干劲，冒着寒冬风雪，起早搭黑，向荒山、穷沟、乱滩进军，在去冬今春不到三个月的时间里，作出了惊人的成绩：（一）松树原计划四年完成三千亩（每亩六百株），结果去冬今春就完成了一半——一千五百亩；（二）防风槐计划两年完成一万五千株，三个月就种了一万二千株；（三）杨柳计划一年完成五千株，一冬天种了六千五百株；（四）核桃计划三年完成四万株，三个月种了二万八千株；（五）接种了梨树五十株，其他苹果、葡萄等果木树苗也基本上准备停当了。经过农业社验收，一般质量都很好。
    下庄村人民在这次水土保持、植树造林大跃进中，得到附近平川几个农业生产合作社的大力帮助。他们现在正在已有成绩的基础上向前迈进，并且积极准备春耕生产。“生地萝卜，熟地葱。”下庄村依据老农民的经验，今年采取农林间作的方法在树苗行中播种早熟作物，以增加社员们的收入。预计三年后葡萄有子、五年后梨树结果、七年后所有果树都有了收获，那时候仅林业收入，每个社员平均每年可得一千七百元，大大地超过当地富裕中农的生活水平。
    单干农民梁福青，亲眼看到农业社气魄浩大的植树造林和生产运动，觉得山区发展前途远大，不仅打消了原先下平川的思想，还积极报名入社。（附图片）
