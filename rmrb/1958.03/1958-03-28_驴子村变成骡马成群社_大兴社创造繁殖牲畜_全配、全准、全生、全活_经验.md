    Donkey Village Transforms into Mule and Horse Commune
    Daxing Commune Creates Experience of "All Mated, All Pregnant, All Born, All Alive" in Livestock Breeding

    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 26th dispatch) The Daxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changtu County, Liaoning Province, has implemented a great revolution in breeding draft animals, creating the experience of "all mated, all pregnant, all born, all alive" in livestock, transforming this village, once known as "old oxen, broken carts, ill-fitting harnesses," into a livestock-rich commune teeming with mules and horses.
    The Daxing Commune is a grain-producing area of Changtu County, but in the past, livestock was always insufficient. In 1950, the commune had over 500 head of livestock, but only over 100 large animals. Each draft animal was responsible for cultivating 3.85 hectares of land, which not only affected the quality of cultivation, but also resulted in a significant amount of land lying fallow each year. Therefore, the Daxing Commune paid great attention to breeding draft animals. In 1957, not only were 100% of the female animals (including cattle and donkeys) mated, but also five "all mated, all pregnant, all born, all alive" production teams emerged, and another fourteen teams achieved "all mated, all pregnant," creating a miracle in the history of livestock breeding. The number of large animals in the commune increased to more than 420, more than three times the number in 1950, and more than double the number in 1955 before the cooperative. At the same time, the quality of horses also improved, with sturdy "Sanhe horses" and "Soviet high-blood horses" replacing the local Mongolian grass horses. The area of cultivated land per draft animal also decreased from 3.85 hectares to 2.98 hectares, creating favorable conditions for improving the quality of agricultural cultivation. The season of livestock abundance and harvest in 1958 is approaching, and the Daxing Commune is making intensive preparations for receiving offspring and mating, striving to increase the production of 200 to 250 young animals this year and become an "all four" commune.
    The reason why the Daxing Commune's livestock breeding work has achieved a great leap forward is primarily because they have earnestly resolved the commune members' ideological disregard for livestock breeding and implemented the policy of self-breeding and self-raising. Secondly, the Daxing Commune has properly resolved a series of issues, such as the contradiction between livestock breeding and agricultural production, which is also an important factor in the smooth development of livestock breeding work. The mating of female animals and the delivery period of pregnant animals are both during the busy spring farming season. If all 300 female animals in the commune are all mated and all give birth, at least more than half of them will not be able to work for twenty days. In order to resolve the contradiction between service and mating, and the birth of foals, they adopted the following four methods: First, strengthen the planning of agricultural production, rationally arrange work, and strive to finish sending manure before the mating of female animals. When agricultural work is really too busy, use some manpower to supplement the shortage of animal power; second, train stray animals, and use stray animals to fill in for female animals that are in heat or giving birth; third, rationally allocate breeding animals, set up mating stations, and reduce man-hour loss. The two folk mating stations also adopted mobile roving inspections and the "sending feet" to the team mating method, which is very popular; fourth, strengthening livestock feeding and management and advancing the estrus period of female animals is also an effective solution. Third, reasonably adjusting the labor remuneration of breeders and formulating a system of rewards and punishments is also a strong guarantee. For example, the reward and punishment system stipulates: a reward of 300 work points to the relevant personnel for producing a foal, which is issued in three stages: 60 points for a confirmed pregnancy (30 points for the handler, 22 points for the feeder, and 8 points for the production team leader); 150 points are awarded for a foal that survives to fifteen days (75 points for the handler, 60 points for the feeder, and 15 points for the team leader); 90 points are awarded for a foal that is one year old (45 points for the handler, 35 points for the feeder, and 10 points for the team leader). Bull and donkey foals are rewarded at one-third of the rate for horse foals. Loss of a foal will be investigated, and appropriate penalties will be imposed according to the circumstances. Commune cadres implement a system of responsibility by area, contracting to the end, and also stipulate reward and punishment methods. Therefore, breeding livestock and loving and protecting livestock has become a regular and conscious action of the broad masses of commune members.
    After the commune members had the idea of a great leap forward in self-breeding draft animals and solved the contradiction between livestock mating, foaling, and service, the Daxing Commune firmly grasped the three key technical measures in livestock breeding. First, do a good job in mating. Accurately judge and decide the mating time. Last year, not only were 100% of the female animals in this commune mated, but also the pregnancy rate reached over 90%. Second, grasp the work of protecting the fetus. In order to ensure that female animals do not miscarry after pregnancy, the cooperative has stipulated a strict system of service and management. Last year, the miscarriage rate of pregnant animals in this commune decreased by more than 30% compared with the previous year. Third, grasp the work of protecting the foals. Feeders, handlers, and team cadres generally mastered the methods of protecting foals, and achieved scientific methods of receiving offspring, fundamentally eliminating the phenomenon of young animal deaths.

    驴子村变成骡马成群社
    大兴社创造繁殖牲畜“全配、全准、全生、全活”经验
    本报沈阳26日电　辽宁省昌图县大兴农业生产合作社实行繁殖耕畜大革命，创造了牲畜“全配、全准、全生、全活”的经验，使这个一向被称为“老牛破车疙疸套”的驴子村变成了骡马成群的畜牧丰收社。
    大兴社是昌图县的产粮区，过去历年牲畜不足。1950年全社五百多头牲畜，只有大牲畜一百多头。每头耕畜负担耕地面积三点八五公顷，不但影响耕作质量，并且每年都有不少耕地撩荒。因此大兴社对繁殖耕畜工作引起了重视。1957年，全社不仅百分之百的母畜（包括牛、驴）都配了种，而且还出现了五个“全配、全准、全生、全活”的“四全”生产队，另有十四个队达到“全配、全准”，创造了牲畜繁殖史上的奇迹。全社的大牲畜发展到四百二十多头，比1950年增加三倍多，比合作化前的1955年增加了一倍多；同时马匹的质量也由膘壮的“三合马”和“苏高血”等代替了当地的蒙古草马。每头耕畜负担的耕地面积也由三点八五公顷降低为二点九八公顷，为提高农业耕作质量创造了有利条件。1958年畜牧丰产丰收的季节快要到来了，大兴社正在进行紧张的接产和配种准备工作，争取今年再增产幼畜二百到二百五十头，成为“四全”社。
    大兴社的牲畜增殖工作所以获得了大跃进，首先是由于他们认真地解决了社员轻视牲畜繁殖的思想和贯彻自繁自养的方针。其次，大兴社在繁殖牲畜中，妥善地解决了繁殖牲畜与农业生产的矛盾等一系列问题，也是繁殖牲畜工作得以顺利发展的一个重要因素。母畜配种和孕畜产期都是在春耕农忙季节，全社三百多头母畜如果全配全生，至少要有一半以上在二十天的时间内不能干活。为了解决使役和配种、产驹的矛盾，他们采取了以下四种办法：一、加强农业生产的计划性，合理安排活计，在母畜配种以前争取把粪送完，农活实在忙不过来的时候，再利用一部分人力补充畜力的不足；二、训练散畜，用散畜给发情、下驹的母畜打替工；三、合理分配种公畜，设置配种站，减少误工时间。两个民间配种站还采用了流动巡回检查、“送脚”到队的配种法，很受欢迎；四、加强牲畜饲养管理，提早母畜发情期，也是一项行之有效的解决办法。第三，合理调整饲养员的劳动报酬，制定奖惩制度，也是一项有力保证。如奖惩制度中规定：产一头马驹奖给有关人员三百个工分，分三个阶段发给：准驹给六十分（使役员三十分，饲养员二十二分，生产队长八分）；幼驹成活到十五天奖给一百五十分（使役员七十五分，饲养员六十分，队长十五分）；满一年的幼驹奖给九十分（使役员四十五分，饲养员三十五分，队长十分）。牛驴驹按马驹的三分之一奖励。掉驹追查责任，分别情况进行适当的惩罚。社干部实行分片负责，包干到底，也规定了奖惩办法。因而繁殖牲畜和爱畜保畜工作变成了广大社员群众经常自觉的行动。
    社员们有了自繁耕畜的跃进思想和解决了牲畜配种、产驹与使役的矛盾等问题以后，大兴社又紧紧地抓住了繁殖牲畜中三大关键性的技术措施。第一、做好配种工作。准确地判断和决定配种时间，去年这个社不仅百分之百的母畜都配了种，而且准驹率也达到了90％以上。第二、抓保胎工作。为了保证母畜怀孕以后不流产，合作社规定了严格地使役、管理制度。去年这个社孕畜流产率比前年减少了30％多。第三、抓保驹工作。饲养员、使役员和队干部一般都掌握了保护畜驹的方法，并做到了用科学方法接产，从根本上杜绝了幼畜死亡的现象。　（杨绍山）
