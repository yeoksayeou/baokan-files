Spring Plowing and Soil
　　Yang Chao

　　"In March, the Jingzhe and Chunfen solar terms arrive, and every commune is mobilized for spring plowing." Spring urges people not to waste the precious time, but to engage in intensive cultivation early, and to have another year of bumper harvests.

　　Plowing the land is for loosening the soil, so that crops can get more nutrients and their roots can develop more vigorously. Because soil is the mother that nurtures and raises crops. Its yellow and black attire may seem like simple mud to ordinary people, but who knows that it contains such complex components: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron... and other minerals and humus. What is humus? It is the organic matter such as plant and animal remains buried in the soil, which becomes a brown or black compound after being invaded by bacteria and protozoa. It also contains elements such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and iron.

　　One of the merits of humus is to provide nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements to crops as nutrients. Not only that, it is also a loose and cohesive substance that can actively unite loose, sandy soil particles together to form countless soil clumps or blocks—granular structured soil. This kind of soil is very beneficial to crop growth.

　　Each granular soil block is united so tightly that there is almost no gap to enter. But every ten million granules are not so close; they leave larger pores between each other in a detached manner. In this way, when the rainfall is sufficient, the small holes inside the granules quickly drink their fill of water. The water that cannot be drunk is滲透渗down from the pores between the granules and stored below. In times of drought, the water in the upper layer of granules evaporates and becomes a dry layer, which prevents the water in the soil below from continuing to evaporate. In winter, the water inside the upper granules freezes, but because there are pores between the granules, air can still pass unimpeded, and water can also enter through the gaps. Therefore, the granular structured soil has very strong water retention and drainage capacity.

　　Since air can penetrate deeply, the surroundings of the granular soil are filled with air, and the microorganisms that like to live in an oxygenated environment—aerobic bacteria—are also very active here. They decompose the organic matter in the granules into minerals such as nitrogen and phosphorus, increasing nutrients for the crops. Inside the granules, because the pores are small and there is a lack of air, the microorganisms that are willing to live in an oxygen-free environment—anaerobic bacteria—are also working: decomposing organic matter into simple organic matter and humus, so that useful substances such as humus in the soil can be preserved and not quickly squandered by aerobic bacteria.

　　For crops, humus and granular structured soil are indeed treasures. However, to increase humus and granules, the soil needs to be tightly united. Because only in this way will there be a lack of air, and more thrifty anaerobic bacteria will work there, so that humus accumulates and soil granules increase. It is also precisely because of this that crops cannot easily get enough nutrients. In order to change this situation, loosening the soil at the appropriate time to allow a portion of the humus to decompose and turn into nutrients useful to crops is the purpose of plowing. When the soil is loosened, the roots of the crops also get a chance to stretch freely and develop, so they can grow stronger.

　　After the spring thaw, the moisture in the upper layer of soil evaporates rapidly. If it is plowed and then harrowed and covered, the loss of moisture can be avoided. This is the moisture-preserving effect of spring plowing. With sufficient moisture in the soil and timely sowing, seeds can germinate and take root early. In addition, after the land is plowed and harrowed, it is well ventilated, and the soil temperature rises, which not only promotes the germination and emergence of seeds, but also creates good conditions for microbial activity. The result of microbial activity can also decompose humus into the nutrients needed for crop growth. In this light, it's best to get an early start on spring plowing!

    春耕与土壤
    杨超
    “三月惊蛰又春分，社社动员忙春耕。”春天催促人们莫等闲误了大好时光，早日进行精耕，今年再来个五谷丰登。
    耕地，为的是疏松土壤，好让庄稼能够得到更多的养分，也能促使庄稼的根发育得更茁壮坚实。因为土壤是孕育和抚养庄稼的母亲。它那副黄澄澄、黑油油的素装，在一般人看来，只不过是简单的泥土而已，谁知道它里面还含有那么复杂的成分：氮、磷、钾、钙、铁……等矿物质和腐植质。什么是腐植质呢？它是土壤里埋藏的植物、动物的尸体等有机质，受到细菌、原生虫的侵袭后变成的褐色或黑色的化合物。其中也含有碳、氮、磷、钙、镁、铁等元素。
    把氮磷等元素供给庄稼作养料，是腐植质的功劳之一。不仅如此，它还是一种结构疏松和带有胶结性的物质，它能主动地把散沙般的土壤细粒团结在一起，组成无数个土团或土块——团粒结构的土壤。这种土壤，对庄稼的生长很有利。
    每一个团粒土块，被团结得那么紧，几乎是无隙可乘。但每千万个团粒之间，就不是那么亲密了，它们若即若离地在彼此之间留下了较大的孔隙。就这样，当雨水充足的时候，团粒内部的小孔里很快就喝足了水。那喝不完的，就从团粒之间的孔隙中渗透到下面保存了起来。干旱的时候，上层团粒中的水分被蒸发掉，变成了干干的一层，就使下面土壤里的水分不再继续蒸发。冬天，上层团粒内的水结冰了，但是，由于团粒之间有孔隙，空气仍然可以通行无阻，水分也能乘虚而入。因而团粒结构土壤的保水和排水能力都很强。
    既然空气可以深入，团粒土壤的周围就充满了空气，那喜好在有氧气的环境中生活的微生物——好气细菌在这里也十分活跃，它们把团粒里的有机质分解成氮、磷等矿物质，替庄稼增加养料。团粒的内部，因为孔小气缺，那愿意在没有氧气的环境中生活的微生物——嫌气细菌也在工作：把有机质分解成简单的有机质和腐植质，使土壤内的腐植质等有用物质得以保存起来，不致被好气细菌很快地挥霍掉。
    对庄稼来说，腐植质和团粒结构的土壤的确是宝贝。但是，要腐植质和团粒增加，就需要土壤团结得很紧。因为只有这样，才会缺少空气，才会有更多的勤俭过日的嫌气细菌在那里工作，使腐植质积聚起来和土壤团粒增加。也正因为这样，庄稼就不容易得到充分的养分了。为了改变这种情况，在适当的时候把土壤疏松一下，让腐植质分解一部分，变成对庄稼有用的养分，这就是耕地的目的。土壤松了，庄稼的根也得到了一个自由伸展和发育的机会，因而能够长得更坚实。
    春天解冻后，上层土壤的水分迅速蒸发，如果耕后随着耙、盖，就可以避免水分散失，这就是春耕的保墒作用。土壤中水分充足，播种及时，种子也得以早日发芽生根。此外，土地耕、耙以后，通气良好，土壤温度升高，不但促进了种子的萌芽出苗，也给微生物活动创造了好条件。微生物活动的结果，又可以使腐植质分解成庄稼生长所需要的养料。这样看来，春耕还是早日动手的好！
