    Hebei Trains Coal Gas Engine Operators
    Hebei Province plans to train 30,000 coal gas engine operators this year. The first training class, with over 1,800 students, began on January 15th of this year. The students are cadres transferred from the province, cities, and various special districts, demobilized soldiers, and some members of agricultural cooperatives. They are expected to graduate in early April and be assigned to work in rural areas.

    In mid-March, six special districts, including Tianjin, Cangxian, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Handan, also simultaneously launched coal gas engine operator training classes.

    A coal gas engine is a power machine that can drive water pumps and waterwheels for irrigation, drive generators to provide rural lighting, and drive flour mills, cotton gins, threshers, and other machines for rural sideline production. Hebei's substantial increase in coal gas engines (planned to increase by 15,000 this year) and the training of operators will greatly promote the mechanization of rural water conservancy.

    河北训练煤气机司机手
    河北省今年计划培养训练煤气机司机手三万名。第一期一千八百多人的训练班已经在今年1月15日开学，学员是省、市和各专区的下放干部、复员军人和农业社的一些社员。他们4月上旬就可毕业，分派到农村工作。
    3月中旬，天津、沧县、保定、石家庄、邢台、邯郸等六个专区也同时举办煤气机司机手训练班。
    煤气机是一种动力机械，可以带动水泵、水车来抽水灌溉，可以带动发电机供农村照明，还可以带动磨粉机、轧花机、脱粒机等从事农村副业生产。河北大量增加煤气机（今年计划增加一万五千台）和培训司机手，对于实现农村水利机械化将有极大作用。
