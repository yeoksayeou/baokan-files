    Fighting to Defend the Cause of the Working Class
    Japanese Communist Party Protests Government Suppression of Workers
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 23rd: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party has issued a statement strongly protesting the police suppression of workers. The statement, published in today's "Akahata" newspaper, points out that the Japanese government is using repressive measures to undermine the democratic foundations of the country.
    On the 20th, Japanese unions in railways, coal mines, electricity, post and telecommunications launched the third joint action of the spring struggle, demanding improved treatment. The Japanese government dispatched a large number of police to suppress workers participating in mass rallies and marches in Tokyo and other places, injuring and arresting many workers.
    The statement by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party said that the government's reactionary policies have aroused the growing resistance of the working class. The Japanese Communist Party will do everything in its power to fight for the cause of the working class and to establish a united front of the working people.
