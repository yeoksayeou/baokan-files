Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 30th: As the economic recession deepens, large Japanese steel companies are intensifying their efforts to swallow up small and medium-sized enterprises.

According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency, Yawata Iron & Steel Co., Japan's largest steel company, has recently decided to merge with three small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, Fuji Iron & Steel Co. and Kobe Steel Co. have also decided to merge with one small and medium-sized steel enterprise each.

The Japanese steel industry has been in a slump since the second half of last year. Since the beginning of this year, it has repeatedly reduced production to cope with overproduction. So far, the production of heavy steel plates, structural steel, and bar steel has been reduced by about 20% to 45%, and small and medium-sized enterprises have been most affected by the production cuts.

Last year, large Japanese steel companies formulated a plan to expand production equipment. According to this plan, they would need 10 billion yen in funds this year alone. However, due to the economic recession and financial difficulties, in addition to abandoning the expansion of factories, they have begun to accelerate the annexation of small and medium-sized enterprises, attempting to strengthen their competitiveness and cope with the upcoming economic crisis.

The report says that as the market slump and financial panic become more serious, this activity of big fish eating small fish will become more common.

    日本钢铁业大鱼吞小鱼
    企图用这办法来逃避经济危机
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：随着经济衰退的日益深刻化，日本钢铁业的大企业吞并中小企业的活动正在加紧进行。
    据日本共同社报道，日本最大的钢铁企业、八幡制铁公司，最近已经决定合并三家中小企业。与此同时，富士制铁公司和神户制钢公司也决定各自合并一家中小钢铁企业。
    日本钢铁企业自从去年下半年就开始不景气，今年年初以来，为了应付生产过剩，一再减产。到目前为止，厚钢板、型钢和条钢等已经减产20％到45％左右，而在减产中受到危害最大的是中小企业。
    日本的大钢铁企业曾经在去年制订了一项扩充生产设备的计划。按照这项计划，只是今年就需要资金一百亿日元。但由于经济衰退，资金枯窘，它们除了放弃扩建工场以外，开始加紧吞并中小企业，企图借此来加强竞争实力，应付即将到来的经济危机。
    消息说，随着市场萧条和金融恐慌的日加严重，这种大鱼吞小鱼的活动将更加普遍。
