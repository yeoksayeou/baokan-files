Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 15th: Workers at the Lanzhou Locomotive Depot and the Longxi Locomotive Depot under the Lanzhou Railway Bureau, each cleaned and inspected a ㄇㄎ一-type locomotive in three hours and seven minutes on the 14th, breaking the national record set by the Jiulongpo Locomotive Depot under the Chengdu Railway Bureau. After inspection by acceptance personnel, the quality of both locomotives was qualified.

In the past, the Lanzhou and Longxi locomotive depots required about fifteen hours to clean and inspect a locomotive. From March 6th to 8th, the Lanzhou Railway Bureau held a Great Leap Forward appraisal conference for various locomotive departments, deciding to break the old routines of step-by-step work and mutual waiting, and adopt advanced methods of joint labor and parallel cross-operation. Under the heroic slogans of "Compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced" and "Create records, break records," in the short week since the 8th, good news of shortening cleaning and inspection times has been constantly reported from various locomotive depots, and the records on the "Leap Forward Record Board" have been refreshed again and again. By the 14th, the average time required for locomotive cleaning and inspection at all four locomotive depots under the entire bureau had dropped to exactly four hours, which is one-fifth of the original target of twenty hours stipulated by the Ministry of Railways.

    洗检机车时间新纪录又被刷新
    兰州赶过九龙坡
    新华社兰州15日电　兰州铁路管理局兰州机务段和陇西机务段的职工，14日以三小时零七分的时间各洗检好一台ㄇㄎ一型机车，刷新了成都铁路管理局九龙坡机务段所创造的全国纪录。这二台机车经过验收人员检验，质量都合格。
    兰州和陇西两个机务段，过去洗检机车所需的时间都在十五小时左右。3月6日到8日，兰州铁路管理局各机务部门召开了一个大跃进评比大会，决定打破过去工作上按部就班、互相等待的常规陋习，采取联合劳动和平行交叉作业的先进方法。在“比先进、赶先进”、“创造纪录、刷新纪录”的英雄口号下，从8日以后的短短一周间，各机务段缩短洗检时间的喜讯不断传来，“跃进纪录牌”上的纪录刷新了又刷新。到14日，全管理局四个机务段的机车洗检平均所需时间，已经下降到四小时整，为铁道部原规定指标二十小时的五分之一。
