    New Machine for Producing Carbon Black
    The Nanping Chemical Plant in Fujian Province has adopted a new type of machine—a molecular dilution carbon black machine—to produce high-quality carbon black. The carbon black produced by this machine is of excellent quality, and its effectiveness in enhancing the wear resistance, elongation, tensile strength, and hardness of various rubber products has reached the national standards. After the Nanping Chemical Plant's new machine went into production, this year's carbon black output will more than double compared to last year, and the production cost will be reduced by 50% to 60%.

    Radio That Needs No Electricity
    The Nanjing Radio Factory has successfully trial-produced a small radio for rural areas that does not require a power source. This radio can receive broadcasts from stations within 100 kilometers.
    This radio consists of a speaker and a base. Due to its simple structure and low cost, the price is expected to be no more than 20 yuan per unit. The technicians at this factory have also trial-produced a magnetic rod. With this magnetic rod, there is no need to bother with setting up an antenna when using it.

    生产炭黑的新机器
    福建省南平化工厂采用了一种新式机器——分子稀释法炭黑机，来生产优质炭黑。这种机器生产的炭黑，质量很好，对增强各种橡胶制品抗磨力、伸长力、扯断力和硬度等方面所起的效能，都达到了国家规定的标准。南平化工厂的这套新机器投入生产以后，今年的炭黑产量将比去年增加一倍多，生产成本降低50％到60％。

    不用电的收音机
    南京有线电厂为农村试制成功一种不用电源的小型收音机。这种收音机可以收听一百公里以内电台发出的播音。
    这种收音机是由一个喇叭和底座组成。由于结构简单，成本低廉，每只价钱预计不超过二十元。这个厂的技术人员还试制了一种磁性棒。有了这根磁性棒，使用的时候就用不着费事去架天线了。
