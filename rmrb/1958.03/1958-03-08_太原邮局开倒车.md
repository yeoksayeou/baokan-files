    Editor's Note: Some post offices have, since last year, cancelled the practice of collecting newspaper subscription fees at the door, stipulating that readers must go to the post office to pay for their newspaper renewals. After the Zhengzhou Post Office piloted this method at its First Branch in September 1957, it resulted in over 360 fewer subscriptions to the Henan Daily that month (subscriptions to other newspapers also decreased significantly). Readers are very dissatisfied with this practice of the post office. After the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China criticized this, the Zhengzhou Post Office stopped promoting it. However, some post offices are still continuing to promote this method. We hope that these post offices will change their practices in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign and better serve the readers.
    
    For four years, I have been a reader of the People's Daily, and I subscribe to a copy myself. If I don't see the newspaper when I get home from work every day, it feels like I haven't had a meal.
    
    For the past few years, the Taiyuan Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau has had postal workers collect newspaper and magazine fees door-to-door on a monthly basis and handle renewal procedures. This really made it convenient for readers, and as long as they budgeted for the newspaper fee each month, they were sure to see the newspaper. However, starting in December 1957, for some unknown reason, the Taiyuan Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau changed the system of door-to-door collection of newspaper and magazine subscriptions, requiring readers to pay at the bureau. I feel that this does not conform to the spirit of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    
    In early February, because I was busy with work, I got home very late every day, and my home was far from the post office. By the time I finished dinner, the post office was already closed. The deadline for subscribing to the People's Daily at the post office in my residential area is the 19th of each month, and I thought I could go to subscribe on the 17th during the Spring Festival holiday. However, when I asked at the post office, the comrades at the post office said that February only had twenty-eight days, and the deadline for subscriptions had been moved up by two days to the 16th, so the People's Daily could only be subscribed to starting from March 6th. The local post office also does not have retail sales of the People's Daily, which really made me extremely anxious. I request that the Taiyuan Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau not only make up for these days' worth of newspapers for me but also restore the door-to-door subscription method that was welcomed by the majority of readers in the past.
    
    I wrote a doggerel poem entitled "Taiyuan Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Bureau is Going Backwards" as follows:
    
    The rectification movement is like a rocket,
    All industries across the country are moving forward;
    Only a strange thing exists in the world,
    The Taiyuan Post Office is acting contrary to everyone else.
    In the past, newspaper fees were collected at home,
    Now, during the rectification, they are delivered to the door [to pay].
    If you are one day late in paying at the door,
    You will suffer the bitterness of five days without a newspaper.
    I would like to ask the editorial department of your newspaper,
    To help the readers voice their grievances.

### 太原邮局开倒车

    太原邮局开倒车
    编者按：有些邮局自去年开始取消了上门收报费的办法，规定读者续订报纸，需到邮局去缴款。郑州邮局1957年9月在第一支局试行这一办法后，当月就漏订了三百六十多份河南日报（其他报纸也减少很多）。读者对邮局的这种办法，非常不满意。中共郑州市委对此提出批评后，郑州邮局才停止推行。但现在仍有些邮局在继续推行这一办法。我们希望这些邮局在反浪费反保守运动中改变做法，更好地为读者服务。
    四年来，我是人民日报的读者，而且自己订一份。每天下班回来看不见报纸，就如没有饭吃一样。
    太原市邮电局过去几年都是由投递员按月上门收报刊费，办理续订手续的。这确实便利了读者，每月只要预算出报费来就一定能看到报纸。但从1957年12月份起，不知何故，太原市邮电局改变上门收订报刊的制度了，让读者到局交费。我觉得这不符合为工农兵服务的精神。
      2月份上旬，我因工作忙，每天下班很晚，家离邮局又远，吃完晚饭邮局已经下班。每月在我住地的邮局，人民日报截止收订时间是19号，我想到17日春节放假时再去订也可以。但到邮局一问，邮局的同志说，2月份只有二十八天，提前两天于16日已经截止收订了，人民日报只能订到3月6日以后的。当地邮局又没有零售人民日报，这件事实在使我焦急万分。我要求太原市邮电局除给我补足这几天的报纸外，还应该恢复以前的为广大读者所欢迎的上门收订的办法。
    我写了一首“太原市邮电局开倒车”的打油诗如下：
    整风运动似火箭，全国各业都向前；人间唯有稀奇事，太原邮局与众反。往日报费来家收，整改之际登门投。登门交费晚一天，五日无报苦难堪。愿请贵报编辑部，帮助读者把
