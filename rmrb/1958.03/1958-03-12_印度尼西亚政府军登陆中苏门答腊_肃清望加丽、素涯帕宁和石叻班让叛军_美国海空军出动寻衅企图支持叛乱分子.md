Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 11th: The Indonesian Army Information Service announced today that, according to reports received yesterday by Army Headquarters, government troops have landed in Central Sumatra and have suppressed the rebels in Wanggali, Suayapaning, and Shilebanrang. The local people, police stations, and government agencies have all expressed their loyalty to the central government and have provided great assistance to the government troops.

In Wanggali, 150 soldiers and police officers surrendered to the government troops with all their equipment. A number of military and police personnel also surrendered in Shilebanrang.

At the same time, the Army Intelligence Department confirmed that Indonesian planes dropped leaflets over Padang, which was seized by the rebel group in Central Sumatra, on March 8.

Western news agencies have reported that these leaflets stated that government troops would land in areas seized by the rebels and arrest the rebels Shafruddin, Hussein, and their followers. The leaflets warned local people not to stay near the docks and asked them to help clear obstacles on the airport runways and then quickly leave these military locations. The leaflets also warned against damaging local buildings.

This newspaper's comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency: The "New York American Journal" admits that the United States is engaged in a diplomatic gamble in Indonesia. The newspaper reported that the U.S. Seventh Fleet and Air Force in the Pacific region are "closely watching Indonesia" under secret orders. "A small but well-organized task force of the Seventh Fleet (including aircraft carriers) is patrolling Indonesian waters near Java."

U.S. naval authorities announced on the 10th that three U.S. Seventh Fleet warships were "patrolling" near Singapore, off the coast of Sumatra. It is said that these three ships and other ships of the Seventh Fleet are "ready to implement the policies of the U.S. government," including "evacuation" work.

On the same day, a spokesman for Texaco Oil Company said in New York that the company was evacuating the families of its staff from the armed rebellion areas of Indonesia. State Department spokesman White also announced the U.S. evacuation measures at a press conference.

At the same time, United Press International, in a dispatch from its Manila correspondent, openly advocated interference in Indonesia's internal affairs by the United States, Britain, and France. The dispatch stated: "Today it seems very clear that the major countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Britain, the United States, and France, must immediately assist the Indonesian rebellion, otherwise they will fail."

The dispatch argued that these countries, which are meeting in Manila, should "painfully assess" the situation in Indonesia and promoted Dulles, Pineau, and Lloyd to risk accusations of "intervention," "colonialism," or other charges, and "openly or secretly support Indonesian rebels."

Jakarta's "People's Daily" pointed out on the 11th that U.S. interference in Indonesia's internal affairs is becoming increasingly unbridled and crude.

The newspaper cited some facts of U.S. interference in Indonesia's internal affairs: Dulles will discuss the Indonesian issue with the British and French foreign ministers at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting; Dulles recently criticized President Sukarno's plan in the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee; the U.S. Seventh Fleet held threatening exercises in Indonesian waters; and the U.S. Seventh Fleet commander openly expressed the hope that a new cabinet would replace the Juanda government.

The newspaper warned that if the United States has not learned enough lessons and insists on its approach, then, with the help of Asian, African, and socialist countries, Indonesia's democratic forces will inflict a comprehensive and most shameful defeat on it. (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚政府军登陆中苏门答腊
    肃清望加丽、素涯帕宁和石叻班让叛军
    美国海空军出动寻衅企图支持叛乱分子
    据新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处今天宣布，根据陆军总部昨天所收到的报告，政府军已经在中苏门答腊登陆，并且肃清了望加丽、素涯帕宁和石叻班让的叛军。当地的人民以及警察局、政府机关都表示效忠中央政府，并且给予政府军很大帮助。
    在望加丽，有军队和警察一百五十人携带全部装备向政府军投诚。在石叻班让也有一批军警投诚。
    同时，陆军情报处证实，印度尼西亚飞机3月8日曾经在中苏门答腊叛乱集团窃据的巴东投掷传单。
    西方通讯社曾经报道，这些传单说，政府军队将在叛乱分子窃据地区登陆，并且逮捕叛乱分子沙弗鲁丁、侯赛尼和他们的追随者。传单警告当地人民不要呆在码头附近，并且要求他们协助清除飞机场跑道上的障碍物，然后迅速离开这些军事地点。传单还警告不得破坏当地各种建筑物。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：“纽约美国人日报”承认，美国正在印度尼西亚进行外交赌博。这家报纸报道说，美国第七舰队和太平洋地区的空军根据秘密命令“正在密切地注视着印度尼西亚。……第七舰队的一支规模虽小而组织完善的作战舰队（其中包括航空母舰）正在爪哇附近的印度尼西亚领海上巡逻”。
    美国海军当局10日宣布，有三艘美国第七舰队的军舰正在苏门答腊海岸对面的新加坡附近“巡逻”。据说，这三艘舰只以及第七舰队的其他舰只“随时准备执行美国政府的政策”，包括“撤侨”工作在内。
    同一天，德士古石油公司的一个发言人在纽约说，这家公司正在从印度尼西亚武装叛乱地区撤退工作人员的家属。国务院发言人怀特也在记者招待会上宣布了美国的撤侨措施。
    与此同时，美国合众社以驻马尼拉记者名义发出一条消息，公然主张美、英、法三国干涉印度尼西亚内政。消息写道：“今天看来十分明显，东南亚条约组织的主要国家英国、美国和法国必须马上援助印度尼西亚的叛乱，否则他们就会失败”。
    这条消息主张正在马尼拉举行会议的这些国家对印度尼西亚局势“忍痛作出估价”，并且鼓吹杜勒斯、比诺和劳埃德甘冒“干涉”、“殖民主义”或其他指责，“公开地或是暗中地支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子”。
    雅加达“人民日报”11日指出，美国对印度尼西亚内政的干涉越来越肆无忌惮和粗暴了。
    这家报纸举出美国干涉印度尼西亚内政的一些事实：杜勒斯将同英、法外长在东南亚条约组织会议上讨论印度尼西亚问题；杜勒斯最近曾经在美国众议院外交委员会上抨击过苏加诺总统方案；美国第七舰队在印度尼西亚附近海面举行了威胁性的演习；美国第七舰队司令公然表示希望有一个新内阁来代替朱安达政府。
    这家报纸警告说，如果美国还没有得到足够的教训而坚持它的做法的话，那么，在亚非国家和社会主义国家的帮助下，印度尼西亚的民主力量会使它遭到全面的和最可耻的失败。（附图片）
