Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, March 15th: According to Bangkok newspapers on the 13th, the Thai cabinet, in a meeting held on the 12th, approved the Ministry of Transportation's proposal to dismiss all members of the American "advisory group" from Thai Airways.

According to reports, since the twenty-seven-member American "advisory group" arrived in Thailand in 1956 to assist in "promoting" the company's business, Thai Airways has not only failed to make a profit, but on the contrary, lost 12 million baht last year. After research, Thai Airways believes that if they continue to follow the "guidance" of the American "advisory group," the business of Thai Airways "will definitely become unmanageable."

    泰航空公司辞退美顾问
    据新华社15日讯　曼谷消息：据曼谷报纸13日报道，泰国内阁在12日举行的会议上，通过了交通部的提议，决定辞退泰国航空公司的全部美国“顾问团”人员。
    据报道，自从1956年美国“顾问团”二十七人到泰国来协助“促进”这家公司的业务以后，泰国航空公司不仅没有盈利，相反地，去年却亏损了泰币一千二百万铢。在经过研究以后，泰国航空公司认为，如果按照美国“顾问团”的“指导”长此下去，泰国航空公司的业务“一定会不可收拾”。
