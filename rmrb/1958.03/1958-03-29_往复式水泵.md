    Reciprocating Water Pump
    To support the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the Baofeng Iron Factory in Henan Province has trial-produced a reciprocating water pump. When in use, the lower pipe is inserted into a pond or well (it must be installed stably), and water can be lifted to the ground by rocking the crank back and forth. The cost of a water pump is about twenty yuan, and it can irrigate three mu of land per day. (Attached picture)

    往复式水泵
    河南宝丰铁工厂为支援农业大跃进，试制成一种往复式水泵。用时把下管插入塘内或井内（必须安装平稳），往返摇动曲柄，就可把水提到地面上来。一部水泵的成本约二十元左右，一天可浇三亩地。（附图片）
