Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 16th: The vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their families in Fujian Province, with the practical actions of contributing labor and money, are working with the local people to realize the great leap forward plan for agricultural production this year.

Having undergone mass debates and raised their socialist consciousness, the vast number of returned overseas Chinese and their families, who in the past participated less in agricultural production labor, have now had 80% to 90% participate in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaigns. The returned overseas Chinese and their families in Shishan District, Nan'an County, together with local farmers, have built more than 1,400 water conservancy projects, capable of irrigating more than 40,000 mu of land. The returned overseas Chinese and their families in Xiayang District, Yongding County, also broke with convention and started accumulating manure on the second day of the Lunar New Year, accumulating more than 31,000 dan of fertilizer in six days. Some returned overseas Chinese and their families who previously disliked the dirtiness of pigs are now raising pigs in every household.

In addition to working hard in labor, returned overseas Chinese and their families in various places are also working hard to change habits such as extravagance and waste, saving large amounts of funds to support agricultural cooperatives in developing production. Returned overseas Chinese and their families in Shishan District, Nan'an County, have invested 1.15 million yuan to help agricultural cooperatives build water conservancy projects and expand production. Returned overseas Chinese and their families in seven townships, including Xi'an and Dongping in Yongchun County, plan to raise one million yuan this year to expand farms and invest in agricultural cooperatives.

    有力出力　有钱出钱
    福建归侨侨眷积极参加农业生产
    新华社福州16日电　福建省广大归侨、侨眷，正以有力出力、有钱出钱的实际行动，和当地人民一起，为实现今年农业生产大跃进规划而努力。
    过去较少参加农业生产劳动的广大归侨、侨眷，在经过全民大辩论，提高了社会主义觉悟以后，已有80％到90％参加了兴修水利和积肥运动。南安县诗山区的归侨、侨眷和当地农民一起，兴修了一千四百多处水利工程，能够灌溉四万多亩地。永定县下洋区的归侨、侨眷还打破惯例，在夏历正月初二就出工积肥，六天中共积肥三万一千多担。过去嫌猪脏的一些归侨、侨眷，现在也都家家养猪了。
    各地归侨、侨眷除了努力参加劳动外，还努力改变铺张浪费等习惯，节约大量资金支援农业社发展生产。南安县诗山区的归侨、侨眷，已经投资一百一十五万元帮助农业社兴修水利和扩大生产。永春县西安、东平等七个乡的归侨、侨眷，计划在今年内筹集一百万元，用来扩大农场和向农业社投资。
