    Protecting and Breeding Wild Economic Animals
    Zhuang Xueben
    China's mountainous areas are vast and rich in resources. To build prosperous and happy mountainous regions, we must not only unearth underground treasures and make forests, grains, and economic plants on the mountains grow faster and better, but also allow animals of economic value to breed in large numbers.
    There are many types of wild animals of economic value in China that belong to the class of mammals. They have a considerable impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. For example, deer antlers, antelope horns, and musk secreted under the navel of the musk deer are all valuable medicinal materials in Chinese medicine and can treat many diseases. The fur of sable, lynx, otter, fox, raccoon dog, weasel, and squirrels are beautiful, light, and soft items for keeping warm. Pandas and golden monkeys are rare and precious animals in the world, and golden monkey skin is also one of the very valuable furs. Their products not only meet the needs of the domestic people's lives, but most of them are also export goods, which can be exchanged for a large number of machines and foreign exchange every year. It is estimated that musk alone can be exchanged for tens of thousands of tons of steel each year.
    However, the methods of collecting wild economic animals are still mostly hunting and killing. Hunting is a "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs" method of production, and often does not distinguish between males, females, and cubs, resulting in indiscriminate killing. Therefore, hunting can cause reduced production or even extinction of economic animals. According to estimates in Sichuan Province, the province produces about 30,000 taels of musk annually, and nearly 200,000 musk deer are killed. In fact, only 60,000 to 70,000 of them are male animals that produce musk, and the remaining 130,000 to 140,000 are females and cubs that are killed needlessly. According to reports from the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, the musk purchasing situation in the past three years, taking 1954 as 100, decreased to 80% in 1955 and 57% in 1956. According to literature records, musk deer were also produced in the mountainous areas near Beijing in the past, but now musk deer have disappeared in Hebei Province.
    Economic animals are the wealth of the country. We should quickly change the hunting methods of indiscriminate killing, and take different measures to protect and develop them according to the different characteristics of the mountainous areas and the living conditions of different animals. At present, the methods of protecting and developing wild animals of economic value generally include hunting bans and domestication.
    Hunting ban is a measure to protect wild animals and allow them to reproduce naturally. Hunting bans should take into account that they do not affect the lives of hunters, ensure the country's needs for local and special products, and at the same time enable females and cubs to reproduce rapidly under human protection. In hunting ban areas, the hunting of harmful animals such as tigers, leopards, wolves, and jackals should be encouraged to prevent economic animals from being harmed by wild beasts.
    Domestication is a more active measure to protect and develop economic animals. China has a relatively early history of raising animals. Sika deer have been raised on farms as economic animals for medicinal purposes for many years. After liberation, specialized deer farms or agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas such as Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Jilin have begun to capture young animals such as red deer for domestication. In 1957, the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan also established two musk deer farms to conduct trial breeding of musk deer. In Heilongjiang, Northeast China, there are also trial breeding programs for fur animals such as silver foxes from the Soviet Union. Domestication involves the cultivation of certain animals entirely with artificial assistance, using scientific methods to collect their products, implementing large-scale breeding according to plan, and gradually improving the breeds of animals to better meet human needs. A male deer can only produce one pair of antlers in its lifetime using hunting methods, worth only several hundred yuan; after domestication, it can grow a pair of antlers every year, and can produce more than ten pairs of antlers in its lifetime, worth up to ten thousand yuan. Furthermore, raising a pair of male and female deer, if breeding goes smoothly under normal circumstances, their offspring can increase by more than twenty deer within ten years. Moreover, artificial breeding and mating may enable faster reproduction or produce better quality antlers. Therefore, the difference in value between domestication and hunting is incomparable.
    According to the distribution of economic animals in China and the different characteristics of mountainous areas in various places, mountainous areas that produce fur animals can generally domesticate certain fur animals. In areas with more deer production, such as Northeast China and Xinjiang, deer can be domesticated. In the Kangzang Plateau, attention should be paid to domesticating musk deer. In some mountainous areas with suitable conditions, multi-species animal domestication can also be carried out after technical conditions are mature. (Attached picture)

    保护和繁殖野生经济动物
    庄学本
    我国山区面积辽阔，资源丰富。建设繁荣幸福的山区，不仅要使地下宝藏翻身，山上的森林、粮食和经济植物长得又快又好，还要让有经济价值的动物得到大量繁殖。
    我国有经济价值的野生动物属于兽类的种类很多。它们对国计民生都有相当大的影响。例如鹿子的鹿茸，羚羊角，麝的脐下分泌的麝香，都是我国医药中的贵重药材，可以治疗许多疾病。貂、猞猁、水獭、狐、貉、鼬、灰鼠等出产的毛皮是美观轻软的御寒用品。熊猫和金丝猴都是世界上稀有的珍奇动物，金丝猴皮也是很贵重的毛皮之一。它们的产品不但供给国内人民生活上的需要，而且绝大部分是出口物资，每年能换回大量的机器和外汇。估计仅麝香一项，每年可以换回上万吨钢材。
    但是，现在对野生经济动物的采集方法，绝大部分还是用狩猎捕杀的方法。狩猎是一种“杀鸡取卵”的生产方法，往往不分公、母和幼仔都加以滥杀。所以，狩猎对经济动物会造成减产甚至灭种的危险。据四川省估计，该省年产麝香约三万两，被捕杀的麝近二十万头，事实上其中产麝香的雄兽只有六七万头，其余十三四万头都是被枉杀的雌、幼兽。又据该省阿坝藏族自治州的报道，近三年来麝香收购的情况，以1954年作为一百，1955年就减少到80％，1956年减少到57％。据文献记载，过去北京近郊山区也产麝，但是现在河北全省麝已绝迹。
    经济动物作为国家的财富，应迅速改变滥施捕杀的狩猎方法，并按不同的山区特点，不同的动物生活情况，采取不同的措施来加以保护和发展。目前，对保护和发展有经济价值的野生动物的方法，一般采用禁猎和驯化。
    禁猎是保护野生动物，让它自然繁殖的一种措施。禁猎应考虑对猎民的生活不致发生影响，保证国家对土特产品的需要，同时使母、幼兽在人力的保护下能迅速的繁殖。禁猎地区对虎、豹、狼、豺……等害兽，应鼓励猎捕，以免经济动物受猛兽的残害。
    驯化是保护和发展经济动物更积极的措施。我国饲养动物的历史较早，梅花鹿作为经济动物设场饲养以供药用已历有年数。解放后在新疆、黑龙江、吉林等地山区有专设的养鹿场或农业社已经捕捉马鹿等幼兽开始驯养。1957年四川阿坝藏族自治州也建立了两个养獐场进行对麝的试养。在东北黑龙江，也有对苏联的银狐等毛皮兽进行试养。驯化完全在人工帮助之下对某些动物进行培育，用科学方法采取它们的产品，按照计划实行大量繁殖，并逐渐改良兽类的品种，使更符合人类的需要。一头公鹿用狩猎方法一生最多只能采到一架鹿茸，价值不过数百元；驯化后它每年能生长一对鹿茸，尽其一生可以生产十多对鹿茸，价值能达万元。再驯养一对公鹿和母鹿，如果在通常顺利的情况下繁殖，十年内子孙合计可以增产二十多头鹿子。而且用人工选种交配，可能使繁殖更快或出产品质更优良的鹿茸。因此，驯化与狩猎价值的相差是不能相比的。
    根据我国经济动物的分布情况和各地山区不同的特点，一般出产毛皮兽的山区可以驯养某些毛皮兽。在东北和新疆等产鹿较多的地区，可以驯养鹿。在康藏高原则应注意驯养麝。在某些有条件的山区，等待技术条件成熟后，还可以进行多种动物的驯养。（附图片）
