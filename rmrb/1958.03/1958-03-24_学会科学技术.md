    Learn Science and Technology
    “Unite the people of all nationalities across the country to wage a new war—a war against nature!” This is a historical task for Party and non-Party cadres at all levels across the country. This war is a new war, a long-term war. To win this war, we must learn new skills, understand science and technology, and learn things we don't know; we must neither be pragmatists who lose their way, nor empty-headed politicians. To achieve this, we must not only have determination, but more importantly, methods. Today, the news in this newspaper about leading cadres in Yunnan learning technology and tackling science provides an example. This news also specifically illustrates with facts that because leading cadres generally have relatively rich practical work experience, they also accept scientific knowledge relatively quickly. According to one lecturer: "These contents cannot be completely explained to university students even in dozens of hours, but they can be explained to the comrades of the Provincial Party Committee in only three and a half hours." This shows that the combination of politics and economics, the unity of politics and technology, is not only entirely possible, but can also be achieved in a not too long period of time.

    学会科学技术
    “团结全国各族人民进行一场新的战争——向自然界开战”！这是全国各级党和非党干部的一项历史任务。这场战争是一场新的战争，长期的战争。要取得这个战争的胜利，我们一定要学新本领，要懂得科学和技术，学会自己不懂的东西；既不做迷失方向的实际家，也不做空头政治家。为了做到这一步，不但要有决心，更重要的还要有办法。今天本报发表的云南领导干部学技术攻科学的新闻，就提供了一个榜样。这条新闻还特别用事实说明：由于领导干部一般都有较丰富的实际工作经验，所以接受科学知识也较快。据一位讲师说：“这些内容对大学生几十个钟头也讲不完，对省委的同志只用三个半钟头就讲完了。”这就说明：政治和经济结合，政治和技术统一，不但是完全可能的，而且可能在并不太长的时间内达到。
