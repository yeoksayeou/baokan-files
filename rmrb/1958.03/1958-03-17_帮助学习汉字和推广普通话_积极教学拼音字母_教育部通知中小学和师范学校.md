Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: The Ministry of Education issued a "Notice Regarding the Teaching of the Pinyin Alphabet in Primary and Secondary Schools and at All Levels of Teachers' Colleges" on the 13th. The notice put forward the following requirements:

	(1) Students in secondary teachers' colleges should actively learn the Pinyin alphabet and use the Pinyin alphabet to learn Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese). Starting from the autumn of 1958, first-year students should be taught the Pinyin alphabet and master the pronunciation section of the language course. Graduates of the class of 1958 graduating in the summer should make up for learning the Pinyin alphabet within this semester. Higher-level teachers' colleges and normal schools should teach the Pinyin alphabet to first-year students entering in the autumn of 1958. Graduates of the class of 1958 graduating in the summer who have not learned the Pinyin alphabet should make up for it within this semester.

	(2) In principle, the first grade of junior high school should start teaching the Pinyin alphabet from the autumn of 1958, and master the pronunciation section of the language course. Students in other grades as well as senior high schools and worker-peasant middle schools should also make up for learning the Pinyin alphabet.

	(3) Starting from the autumn of 1958, the first grade of primary school should, as far as possible, teach the Pinyin alphabet and use the Pinyin alphabet to help with literacy and learn Putonghua. If teachers really do not have the conditions to teach the Pinyin alphabet, they may temporarily not teach it. However, they should actively learn and prepare conditions, and strive to start teaching from the autumn of 1959. Language teachers in other grades who already have the conditions to teach the Pinyin alphabet can, starting from the autumn of 1958, allocate a part of the time in the language course within one semester to teach the Pinyin alphabet.

	(4) In adult education in cities and in rural areas where the Northern dialect is spoken, it is also possible to try teaching the Pinyin alphabet to help with literacy and eliminate illiteracy.

	(5) Schools for ethnic minorities can also try using the Pinyin alphabet to learn Chinese.

	(6) In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the teaching of the Pinyin alphabet, language teachers in the first grade of middle and primary schools and all language teachers in teachers' colleges should conduct a study of the Pinyin alphabet before the start of the autumn semester of 1958. Language teachers in other grades of middle and primary schools should also participate in the study as much as possible.

	The notice finally requires all localities and schools to flexibly grasp the specific circumstances, formulate plans, and implement them.
