Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, London dispatch: British economic circles and newspapers are increasingly uneasy about the impact of the American economic recession on Western Europe.

The Governor of the Bank of England, Cobbold, said on the 26th that the economic recession around the capitalist world "appears to be more aggressive than in February." He said it is still difficult to judge "how long and how extensive" the economic recession around the world will last.

The British Cooperative Party's newspaper, "Reynolds News," published an editorial on the 23rd saying: The economic recession "is approaching and intensifying day by day. This is a (capitalist) world recession, which has even shaken the American economy built on a solid dollar foundation. In one (Western) country after another, production has declined and unemployment has increased."

The editorial pointed out that the number of fully unemployed people in Britain is the highest since Britain's "retreat from Dunkirk" during World War II, and Britain is now facing the threat of an "economic Dunkirk retreat." The newspaper demanded that the British government quickly pay attention to Britain's "economic defense line," and try to strengthen British industry so that it can "earn a living in an ever-shrinking and increasingly competitive (capitalist) world market."

"Reynolds News" pointed out that the Conservatives are now afraid to mention the word "recession." Faced with the ugly image of economic recession, the Conservatives "would rather close their eyes tightly and not look at it, hoping it will go away by itself." However, "the recession refuses to go away."

The British magazine "Foreign Report" pessimistically estimated in its March 20th issue that the American economy "has little hope of a huge seasonal rise this summer"; some anti-recession measures taken by the American government, such as increasing military spending and accelerating the construction of so-called "civil public works," may not take effect "before the end of this year."

The magazine believes that judging from the current fluctuations in American economic indicators, the American economy "may have a long period of stagnation, which may last for as long as three years."

    资本主义世界经济战线百孔千疮
    英报要求政府设防自保
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：英国经济界人士和报纸对于美国经济衰退将对西欧产生的影响愈来愈感到不安。
    英格兰银行总裁柯波德26日说，现在资本主义世界各地的经济衰退情况“看来比2月份更加咄咄逼人”。他说，世界各地经济衰退究竟“会持续多久和范围有多大”，现在还很难判断。
    英国合作党的报纸“雷诺新闻”23日发表社论说：经济衰退“正在逐日接近和加剧。这是一次（资本主义）世界性的衰退，甚至动摇了建立在坚固的美元基础上的美国经济。在一个又一个（西方）国家中，生产下降了，失业增加了。”
    社论指出，英国目前全失业人数之多是第二次世界大战时期英国“从敦刻尔克撤退以来所没有过的”，英国现在正面临着一次“经济战线上的敦刻尔克撤退”的威胁。这家报纸要求英国政府赶快注意英国的“经济防线”，设法加强英国的工业，使它能够“在一个不断缩小和竞争愈来愈剧烈的（资本主义）世界市场上挣钱维持生计”。
    “雷诺新闻”指出，保守党人现在害怕提到“衰退”这个字眼。面对着经济衰退的丑恶形象，保守党人“宁愿紧紧闭上眼睛不看它，希望它自己会走开”。但是，“衰退却不肯走开”。
    英国“外事报道”杂志在20日出版的一期中悲观地估计：美国经济“没有多大的希望会在今年夏天有巨大的季节性上升”；在“今年年底以前”，美国政府所采取的一些反衰退措施如增加军事开支、加速进行所谓“民用公共工程”建设等，也不一定会发生效果。
    这家杂志认为，从目前美国经济指标的波动情况看来，美国经济“可能有一个长时期的停滞，这种停滞也许要延续三年之久”。
