Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th: The great leap forward in spring has brought the good news of accelerating the overall greening of Shanghai. The revolutionary drive of the masses has pushed Shanghai's tree planting target for this year from six million to fifteen million five hundred thousand.

The Putuo District, which initiated a competition among all districts in the city, convened an emergency meeting of the District People's Committee at 2 a.m. on the 26th, revising the district's greening tree planting target for this year from two million to three million. Someone asked in surprise: "Can there be so many seedlings?" The masses replied: "Yes. We can also complete the task of cultivating two million seedlings for tree planting next year." Residents of workers' new villages such as Caoyang New Village and many neighborhoods are automatically paying for seedlings. Tens of thousands of workers and staff returning from their hometowns for the Spring Festival brought seedlings from their homes. Agricultural cooperatives in Wu County, Jiangsu Province, gave priority to selling 50,000 fruit tree seedlings and precious flower and tree seedlings to Shanghai. Many units organized shock brigades to dig up seedling sources in other places. People used to worry about the source of seedlings for Shanghai's six million trees this year, but now they are convinced that there is no problem.

Regardless of the Spring Festival holiday, day or night, the residents' slogan is: "Seedlings are planted as soon as they arrive." Residents of Zhabei District thoroughly turned over the soil on the land deeply traumatized by the artillery fire of Japanese imperialism and planted seedlings. The working people in the shantytowns are planting flowers on the malodorous riverbanks that are being filled in. Even in the alleys with only small plots of land, they are learning from the experience of the masses on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei District in establishing small gardens and are universally preparing to build "mass small gardens." Even in the Yimiao District and Huangpu District, where there is very little land, they have also begun to plant various potted flowers and climbing plants on the streets, alleys, balconies, and rooftops.

The work of imparting tree planting techniques in Shanghai has been fully launched. More than 15,000 people in various districts, agencies, factories, and schools have received tree planting training, and these people are spreading tree planting knowledge to the masses. Many scientists and technicians, hearing that Shanghai will plant 800,000 fruit trees in the suburbs and urban areas this year, volunteered to go to the countryside and neighborhoods to serve as technical guidance. More than 20,000 science popularization workers and many biology and botany teachers in schools have also mobilized their forces to participate in the publicity work of greening. After the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee announced the tree and green space protection management measures on the 26th, Young Pioneers in Yucai Middle School and other schools have begun to organize maintenance groups to carry out publicity on the protection of flowers and trees to young children.

In order to implement the spirit of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee has decided to change the past situation of planting too many ornamental plants in parks and green areas throughout the city, and is preparing to plant more fruit trees, bamboo, spice trees, and economic forests, so that greening work can better contribute to industrial and agricultural development.

The Shanghai Greening Work Ten Thousand People's Congress held on the afternoon of the 26th has announced a challenge to Tianjin to launch a greening friendship competition between the two cities. Shanghai will basically be greened in two years, basically colorized and scented in three years, become gardens and forests in five years, and the fruits produced in Shanghai's urban and suburban areas will basically meet the needs of the market in ten years.

    创造美好的居住环境
    拿出干劲奋战两三年
    绿化　彩化　香化上海市
    成千上万职工从家乡带来了大量树苗
    新华社上海27日电　大跃进的春天带来了上海加速全面绿化的喜讯，群众的革命干劲已经把上海今年植树的指标从六百万棵推向一千五百五十万棵。
    向全市各区倡议竞赛的普陀区在26日晨二时召开了区人民委员会紧急会议，把全区今年绿化植树指标从二百万棵修改为三百万棵。有人惊奇地问：“能有这样多树苗吗？”群众的回答：“有。我们还能为明年植树完成育苗二百万株的任务”。曹杨新村等工人新村和很多里弄的居民自动出钱买树苗。成千上万个春节回乡归来的工人、职员从家带来了树苗。江苏省吴县的农业社把五万株果树苗和名贵的花木树苗优先售给上海。许多单位组织了到外地挖掘苗源的突击队。人们过去对上海今年植树六百万棵的苗源曾经感到忧虑，现在都坚信没有问题了。
    不管春节假日，不论白天黑夜，居民们的口号是：“树苗随到随种”。闸北区居民把深受日本帝国主义侵略炮火创伤的土地上的泥土彻底翻过来，种上了树苗。棚户地区的劳动人民正在填没的臭水滨上种植鲜花。只有小块土地的里弄里，也正在吸取闸北区中兴路群众建立小花园的经验，普遍筹建“群众小花园”。连小块土地也很少的邑庙区、黄浦区，也开始在街头巷尾、阳台屋顶上种植各种盆花和栽植爬藤等植物。
    上海传授植树技术的工作已全面展开。各地区、各机关、工厂、学校已有一万五千多人受到植树训练，这些人正在向广大群众传播植树知识。许多科学技术工作者听到上海今年要在郊区和市区种八十万株果树，就自告奋勇地下乡下里弄，担任技术指导。两万多科学普及工作人员和许多学校中的生物、植物教员，也已调动力量参加绿化的宣传工作。26日，上海市人民委员会公布了树木绿地保护管理办法以后，育才中学等校的少先队员已开始组织养护小组，向年幼的儿童开展爱护花木的宣传。
    为了贯彻反浪费反保守的精神，上海市人民委员会决定改变过去全市公园和绿化地区过多种植观赏草木的情况，准备多种果树、竹子、香料树和经济林木等，使绿化工作更有助于工农业发展。
    26日下午举行的上海绿化工作万人大会已宣布向天津市应战，展开两市之间绿化友谊竞赛。上海将在两年内基本绿化，三年内基本彩化香化，五年内成园成林，十年内上海市区和市郊生产的水果将基本上满足市场的需要。（附图片）
