The Algerian people, having exhausted all peaceful means to liberate themselves, finally launched another uprising in 1954. Since the French occupation of Algeria in 1830, every uprising launched by the Algerian people had been drowned in blood by the French colonialist forces. On November 1, 1954, three thousand Algerian guerrillas, who had undergone rigorous guerrilla warfare training in absolute secrecy for a long and arduous period, established a base in the Aurès Mountains.

Because the number of Algerian fighters was very limited, the French said that these "outlaws" could be quickly eliminated. However, in the hearts of the Algerian people, those three thousand warriors who first raised the banner of righteousness in the Aurès Mountains were messengers of national revival.

The entire Algeria was shaken.

Peasants joined the ranks of the fighters in droves. They had always hoped for a better life where they could eat when hungry and clothe themselves when cold, and where they could live as human beings rather than serfs. They would now realize this hope themselves. Often with only one hunting rifle for every six or even ten people, they launched ambushes against the French army, seized the French army's weapons, and used them to attack the French police stations, gendarmeries, and barracks in Algeria.

In cities and towns, resistance movements were immediately and intensely organized. Workers donated their wages to the revolutionary cause. Women collected clothes and food for the insurgents. Children served as messengers. Young people competed to join the underground army. Even the elderly did everything they could to contribute to the Algerian struggle. The entire Algerian people rose up in unison, standing united like a wall against French colonialism. When university students left school to join the guerrillas, national unity had been achieved. The historic strike of Algerian university students was the final signal of the complete unity of all national liberation forces.

When France failed to suppress the Algerian revolutionaries who first rose up in November 1954, it adopted increasingly violent means. Within three years, France sent eight hundred thousand soldiers, police, and gendarmes to Algeria. In addition, two hundred thousand Europeans living in Algeria formed militias, local defense groups, and reserve forces. France's sinister intention was to suppress the Algerian revolution by exterminating the Algerian people. Because the revolutionary fighters were among the people, just like fish in water, as Chairman Mao Zedong said.

To this end, the French colonial army used every inhuman means in Algeria to harm the people. In the cities, virtually all Algerian men, young and old, were subjected to torture, and some were secretly executed. Women were taken in hundreds to places occupied by the police, first subjected to gang rape, then tortured, and finally sent to serve in the auxiliary organs of the French army. The case of Djamila Bouhired aroused worldwide anger, but this was the daily experience of every Algerian woman.

In the countryside, entire villages were bombed and razed to the ground, and residents died in air raids and machine-gun fire. French special forces often killed all the men in a town in front of women and children, filling the residents with grief and terror.

France designated entire areas of Algeria as "forbidden zones." The "forbidden zones" were set on fire. The French colonial army could wantonly kill residents; supplies and food were completely cut off, and residents who had not been killed had to eat grass roots and tree bark. Such areas included almost the Aurès, Northern Constantine, Kabylie, Algiers, Oran, and the areas near the Moroccan border. After bombing the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef, France announced more than two months ago that it would kill 350,000 Algerian residents living in the border area between Algeria and Tunisia. Now the whole world knows that this border area is called the "no-man's-land of death." This area is seventy-five kilometers wide and three hundred kilometers long, including ninety-two villages and towns.

Four hundred thousand Algerians, driven by poverty, left their homeland to find work in France, and became the target of suppression and torture. Even Tunisians and Moroccans, because their skin color was the same as Algerians, were considered Algerians and were imprisoned and tortured. Every day, hundreds of Algerians in France were sent to death camps set up in Algeria. As soon as they arrived in Algeria, French paratroopers killed some of them to intimidate the rest.

The result of France's massacre of the Algerian people is that six hundred thousand of Algeria's twelve million people have been killed. Five hundred thousand have fled to Tunisia and Morocco. Another one and a half million Algerians are homeless and wandering everywhere.

So, what can France gain from this war?

Everyone knows that the Algerian war has damaged France's finances. France spends two billion francs every day to maintain its troops stationed in Algeria. In Algeria, France has lost hundreds of aircraft in recent months. In addition, hundreds of young people lose their lives in the war every day.

Because the Algerian people's resistance is becoming more and more tenacious, France cannot continue the war on its own. It has received weapons assistance from the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The situation of France using American bombers and American bombs to bomb the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef is now happening in Algeria every day. American helicopters, large trucks, jeeps, and carbines are all weapons used by France to slaughter the Algerian people. In addition, the United States, which has been supporting France's colonial war of conquest in Algeria with dollars for several years, recently gave France another loan of 655 million U.S. dollars.

Not only that, Western diplomats and propaganda organizations have also been helping France, and they are not just keeping a complicit silence. The Algerian question has been discussed three times in the United Nations General Assembly.

In February 1957, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution instructing France to find a peaceful and democratic way to resolve the Algerian question. But France's answer was to intensify its suppression in Algeria. In 1956, the entire population of Algiers experienced three months of terror. Shops, houses, and residences were looted, women were raped, and men were tortured and subjected to collective massacres.

In December 1957, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a settlement of the Algerian question through negotiations. France's answer was to bomb Sakiet Sidi Youssef and turn the Algerian border near Tunisia into a "no-man's-land of death," that is, it deliberately murdered 350,000 Algerian people, most of whom were women, children, and the elderly. France's contempt for the United Nations' decisions is because it has the support of American diplomacy.

The Algerian people are no longer just fighting against colonialist France, but against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, against American gold and European loans to France.

Of course, the Algerian National Liberation Army, which has a hundred thousand soldiers, modern light equipment and weapons, and has always been supported by all strata of the Algerian people, is invincible. However, the struggle is arduous. Because the French army burned all the forests, grains, and other crops, Algerian fighters often fight on empty stomachs.

The people of Asia and Africa should enable the Algerian revolution, which has already achieved many victories, to achieve the most basic and primary goal that the Algerian people are determined to achieve: Algeria's complete independence and the complete crushing of French colonial rule in Algeria.

The people of Asia and Africa should provide rapid and effective material and moral assistance to the Algerian people. Because, the Algerian war is a serious threat to world peace. The Algerian war was one of the reasons that prompted France, Britain, and Israel to launch the Suez War. The Algerian war is the root cause of the bombing of Sakiet Sidi Youssef. The Algerian war is the reason for France's more than 50 violations of Tunisian sovereignty. The Algerian war made France violate the rights of free flight and navigation: kidnapping the five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, intercepting the Yugoslav ship "Slovenia"...

The diplomatic assistance and propaganda of Asian and African countries will force France to abide by the laws of war in Algeria.

In fact, France violated the Geneva International Convention, especially the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. France does not recognize that it is at war with the Algerian people and arbitrarily executes Algerian fighters. A representative of the International Red Cross came to Algeria to investigate the situation of the four French prisoners of war captured by the Algerian National Liberation Army in Djebel Wasdah on January 11, 1958, and the Algerian National Liberation Front made it clear to him that the Algerian National Liberation Front was determined to abide by the laws of war. Nevertheless, from January 11, 1958, to the end of February, one hundred and twenty-seven Algerian fighters were sent to the guillotine by Lacoste's men, and another three hundred were about to suffer the same fate.

Now is the time to stop all these destructive acts by France: France violated the most basic human rights, violated the laws of war, violated international law, carried out forty months of blatant and continuous aggression and collective massacres against the Algerian people, and violated the Algerian people's right to self-determination. The material and spiritual assistance of the Asian and African people is to stop these.

Today, Algeria is the advancing fortress of the anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggle in the world. It is the bridgehead of the entire Africa and the hub of Africa. This hub cannot continue to be controlled by France, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Western imperialist forces.

Algeria's independence will greatly promote the national independence movement throughout Africa.

Algeria's independence is to defend peace and is a victory for the Bandung spirit.

Now, Asia and Africa both see this fact.

    阿尔及利亚的革命在前进中
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表　卜拉欣·加法
    阿尔及利亚人民为了解放自己而用尽了一切和平方法以后，终于在1954年再一次发动起义。自从1830年法国占领阿尔及利亚以来，阿尔及利亚人民发动的历次起义都被法国的殖民主义势力扼杀在血泊之中。1954年11月1日，三千名阿尔及利亚游击队员，在漫长而艰苦的岁月中曾经在绝对秘密的情况下受过严密的游击战争训练，在奥雷斯山区建立了根据地。
    由于阿尔及利亚战士的人数非常有限，所以法国人说：这些“不法之徒”是很快就可以肃清的。但是，在阿尔及利亚人民的心目中，奥雷斯山区中那三千名首举义旗的战士，正是民族复活的使节。
    整个阿尔及利亚被震撼了。
    农民们成群结队地加入战士的行列。他们一直希望能够过饥有食、寒有衣的较好的生活，能够作为一个人而不是农奴，这个希望就要由他们自己来加以实现了。农民们往往六个人甚至十个人才有一枝猎枪，他们就这样对法国军队展开了伏击战，夺到法国军队的武器，就用来袭击法国人在阿尔及利亚所设的警察局、宪兵队和兵营。
    在城市和村镇里，也马上紧张地开始组织抵抗运动。工人们把工资献给革命事业。妇女们为起义者收集衣服和粮食。孩子们担任了联络工作。青年们争先加入地下军。甚至老年人也千方百计地为阿尔及利亚的斗争事业效力。阿尔及利亚全国人民都奋袂而起，团结得像一堵墙似的屹立在法国殖民主义面前。等到大学生离开学校加入了游击队，全国的大团结已经实现。阿尔及利亚大学生历史性的罢课，正是一切民族解放力量全部联合起来的最后信号。
    法国没有能够把1954年11月最先起义的阿尔及利亚革命者镇压下去，它就采取了越来越狂暴的手段。在三年中，法国派了八十万士兵、警察和宪兵到阿尔及利亚。还有二十万住在阿尔及利亚的欧洲人组成了民兵、乡团和预备役兵。法国的罪恶企图就是要用绝灭阿尔及利亚人民的办法，来镇压阿尔及利亚的革命。因为革命战士在人民当中，正如毛泽东主席所说的那样，就像鱼在水里一样。
    为此，法国殖民军就在阿尔及利亚用尽了一切惨无人道的手段来残害人民。在城市里，阿尔及利亚一切男人，不论老幼，几乎都受到了毒刑折磨，有些人还被悄悄地处死了。妇女们是成百地被押往警察占用的场所，先是受到集体奸污，再受毒刑，最后还要送到法国军队的附属机关去服役。加米拉·布伊海德的事件曾经激起了全世界的愤怒，而这却是每一个阿尔及利亚妇女的日常遭遇。
    在农村里，整批整批的村落被炸毁夷平，居民死于空袭和机关枪扫射之下。法国的特种队伍，经常当着女人、孩子的面把一个镇上的男子全都杀死，好让居民充满了伤惨和恐怖。
    法国在阿尔及利亚把整片整片的地区划为“禁区”。“禁区”一概放火烧光。法国殖民军可以任意残杀居民；给养和粮食完全断绝，还没有被杀死的居民只好吃草根树皮。这样的地区几乎包括奥雷斯、北君士坦丁、卡利比、阿尔及尔、阿兰和靠近摩洛哥边境的地区。法国轰炸了突尼斯的萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村以后，又在两个多月前宣布要杀死住在阿尔及利亚和突尼斯交界地方的三十五万阿尔及利亚居民。现在全世界都知道这个边界地区叫做“死亡的无人地带”。这片地方有七十五公里宽，三百公里长，包括了九十二个村镇。
    四十万被穷困所迫离开祖国而到法国去找工作的阿尔及利亚人，也成为镇压和折磨的对象。甚至像突尼斯人和摩洛哥人，因为肤色和阿尔及利亚人一样，也被认为是阿尔及利亚人而被关进监狱和苦刑拷打。每天，总有几百个在法国的阿尔及利亚人被送到设在阿尔及利亚的死亡营去。等他们一到阿尔及利亚，法国伞兵便杀死其中的一部分，来威吓其余的人。
    法国对阿尔及利亚人民进行这场屠杀的结果是：阿尔及利亚一千二百万人口中，已有六十万人被夺去了生命。有五十万人逃亡到突尼斯和摩洛哥。另外一百五十万阿尔及利亚人无家可归，到处流浪。
    那末，法国在这场战争中能够得到些什么呢？
    大家知道，阿尔及利亚战争破坏了法国的财政。法国为了维持它驻在阿尔及利亚的军队，每天要消耗二十亿法郎。在阿尔及利亚，法国最近几个月以来已损失了几百架飞机。另外，每天有几百个年青人在战争中丧失了生命。
    由于阿尔及利亚人民的抵抗越来越顽强，法国光靠自己是不能继续进行战争的。它得到了美国通过北大西洋集团所供给的武器援助。法国使用美国轰炸机和美国的炸弹轰炸突尼斯的萨基埃特·西迪·优素福村的情形，现在每天都在阿尔及利亚发生。美国的直升飞机、大卡车、吉普车、卡宾枪，都是法国用来屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的武器。此外，几年以来一直用美元支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民征服战争的美国，最近又一次给法国六亿五千五百万美元的贷款。
    不但如此，西方的外交人士和宣传机构还一直在帮法国的忙，他们并不只是保持同谋者的沉默就算了。阿尔及利亚问题已经在联合国大会讨论过三次。
    1957年2月，联合国大会曾经通过决议责成法国寻找一个和平和民主的方法解决阿尔及利亚问题。可是法国的答
      复却是加紧在阿尔及利亚的镇压行动。1956年，阿尔及尔的全体居民经历了为期三月的恐怖的日子。商店、房屋、住宅惨遭抢劫，妇女被强奸，男子被非刑拷打和遭到集体屠杀。
    1957年12月，联合国大会通过决议要求通过谈判来解决阿尔及利亚问题。法国的答复却是：轰炸萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村，并把阿尔及利亚靠近突尼斯的边境变成“死亡的无人地带”，这就是说，它蓄意谋杀三十五万阿尔及利亚人民，其中大多数是妇女、儿童和老年人。法国这样蔑视联合国的决定是因为它得到
  了美国外交的支援。
    阿尔及利亚人民已不是仅仅对殖民主义的法国进行斗争，而是对北大西洋公约集团、对美国金元和欧洲国家给法国的贷款进行斗争。
    当然，拥有十万之众、具有现代化轻便装备和武器、并一贯为阿尔及利亚各阶层人民所拥护和支援的阿尔及利亚民族解放军是不可战胜的。但是，斗争是艰苦的。因为法国军队焚烧了一切树林、粮食和其它农作物，阿尔及利亚的战士常常空着肚子进行战斗。
    亚非各国人民应该使已经取得很多胜利的阿尔及利亚革命能够达到阿尔及利亚人民决心争取的最基本和最首要的目的：阿尔及利亚的完全独立和彻底粉碎法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。
    亚非各国人民应该对阿尔及利亚人民迅速而有效地进行物质和道义的援助。因为，阿尔及利亚战争是对世界和平的严重威胁。阿尔及利亚战争是促使法、英和以色列发动苏伊士战争的原因之一。阿尔及利亚战争是轰炸萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村的根源。阿尔及利亚战争是法国五十多次侵犯突尼斯主权的原因。阿尔及利亚战争使得法国侵犯了自由飞行和航行的权利：绑架了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的五位领袖、拦劫南斯拉夫的船只“斯洛文尼亚号”……。
    亚非各国的外交援助和宣传将迫使法国在阿尔及利亚遵守战争法规。
    事实上，法国违反了日内瓦国际公约，特别是1949年8月12日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约。法国不承认它和阿尔及利亚人民是处于战争状态，任意处死阿尔及利亚的战士。国际红十字会的一位代表曾来阿尔及利亚调查1958年
  1月11日在泽贝尔、瓦斯达被阿尔及利亚民族解放军俘获的四名法国战俘的情况，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线曾向他表明了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线是坚决遵守战争法规的。尽管如此，从1958年1月11日到2月底，一百二十七名阿尔及利亚战士被拉戈斯特的手下人送上了断头台，还有三百名即将遭受同样命运。
    现在要制止法国的这一切破坏行为：法国侵犯了最基本的人权，违反了战争法规，违反了国际法，对阿尔及利亚人民进行了四十个月明目张胆和连续不断的侵略和集体屠杀，侵犯了阿尔及利亚人民的自决权。亚非人民在物质上和精神上的援助，就是为了制止这些。
    今天，阿尔及利亚是全世界反殖民主义和反帝国主义斗争的前进堡垒。它是整个非洲的桥头堡，是非洲的枢纽。这个枢纽不能继续被法国、北大西洋集团和西方帝国主义力量所掌握。
    阿尔及利亚的独立将大大促进整个非洲民族独立运动。
    阿尔及利亚的独立就是保卫和平，是万隆精神的胜利。
    现在，亚洲和非洲都看到了这个事实。（附图片）
