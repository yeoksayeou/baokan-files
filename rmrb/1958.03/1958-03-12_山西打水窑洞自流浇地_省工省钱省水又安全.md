Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 7th. Yongji County, Shanxi Province, has successfully tested a new method for damming floods and developing mountain water conservancy: water cellar caves. Because many water cellar caves are built in one place, farmers also call them water cellar clusters.

Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summarized this creation of the peasants, believing that it is an advanced experience of universal significance for the current introduction of water to the mountains and expansion of the irrigated area of ​​terraced fields and slopes. The Provincial Party Committee has begun to organize leading cadres and representatives of agricultural cooperatives from various places to visit and learn, and will vigorously promote it throughout the province.

This method was created by the Hongchun Agricultural Cooperative of Dawangzhuang Township on the southern foot of the Zhongtiao Mountain in Yongji County. The Dawangzhuang Township area has more than 30 large earth ridges and gullies that are more than 60 zhang deep. It has been threatened by natural disasters for years and is a well-known "drought spot." Local farmers say, "Nine li and eighteen bends, ten li to carry water," not to mention diverting water for irrigation, even water for people and animals is very difficult. Last winter, during the water conservancy construction campaign, the members came up with ideas and methods. After many experiments, they finally tested this water cellar cave method.

This method involves: selecting a high cliff edge with abundant water sources, digging earth cellars along the slope, opening an inlet at the top to divert floodwater into it for storage. In addition, a water gate is built at the bottom of the cellar cave. Because the water cellar cave is located high up, when using water for irrigation, just open the gate and the water will flow out automatically for irrigation. Combining the water from the water cellar clusters can also irrigate distant terraced fields. At present, the township has used this method to build more than 3,000 water cellar caves. It is expected that by this winter, the mountain land of the whole township can realize water conservancy.

According to the appraisal of water conservancy technicians of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction, water cellar caves save labor, money, and are safer than the currently popular dry wells and reservoirs in rural areas. The stored water is not easily evaporated, saves water lifting tools, and irrigates more land. According to the usage of the Hongchun Agricultural Cooperative, the more than 100 completed water cellar caves can irrigate an average of 2.4 mu each, and ensure the water use of 5 to 6 mu of dry land.

### 山西打水窑洞自流浇地  省工省钱省水又安全

    山西打水窑洞自流浇地
    省工省钱省水又安全
    新华社太原7日电　山西省永济县试验成功一种拦蓄洪水开发山区水利的新办法——水窑洞。因为在一个地方集中打许多水窑洞，农民又叫作水窑群。
    最近中共山西省委总结了农民这一创造，认为这是当前引水上山、扩大梯田坡地灌溉面积有普遍意义的先进经验。省委已开始组织各地领导干部和农业社代表前往观摩学习，将在全省范围内大力推广。
    这个办法是永济县中条山南麓大王庄乡红春农业社创造出来的。大王庄乡一带有三十多个大土岭，沟深六十多丈，历年来受自然灾害威胁，是个出名的“旱疙瘩”。当地农民说：“九里十八湾，十里把水担”，不要说引水浇地，就是人畜用水都十分困难。去年冬季在兴修水利运动中，社员们出主意想办法，经过多次试验，最后才试验出这种水窑洞的办法。
    这种办法是：选择水源充沛的高崖边，顺着坡势挖成土窑，上边开一个入水口，把洪水引进去贮藏起来。另外，在窑洞底端修一个放水闸门。由于水窑洞居高临下，用水浇地时，只要把闸门打开，水就自动流出浇地。把水窑群的水汇合起来，还能灌溉远地梯田。目前，全乡采取这种办法已打成了三千多眼水窑洞。预计到今年冬季，全乡山地就可以实现水利化。
    根据山西省农业建设厅水利技术人员的鉴定，水窑洞比目前农村通行的旱井和蓄水池省工、省钱又安全，蓄的水不容易蒸发，节省提水工具，而且浇地也多。按照红春农业社的使用情况，已竣工的一百多眼水窑洞，平均每眼可以浇地两亩四分，并保证五、六亩旱地的用水。
