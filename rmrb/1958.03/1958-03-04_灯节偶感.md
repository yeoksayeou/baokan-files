    Occasional Thoughts on the Lantern Festival
    It's the Lantern Festival again, which makes me think of watching lanterns, and then I remember watching a dragon lantern dance when I was little. The colorful giant dragon, rising and falling, spinning and dancing, had a posture of wanting to leap up to the sky. It was inspiring.

    So, I can't help but think of the current Great Leap Forward. People in all walks of life are competing to be advanced and catch up with the advanced. If you overtake me, I will leap up and chase after you, and then overtake you again. The situation is really pressing, and there is no room for falling behind. This rising and falling situation is just like the dragon lantern spinning and dancing, and the fact that you are chasing me and making leaps forward section by section is really like a living giant dragon. - Didn't a British journalist say that we are a giant dragon of the East, closely following behind Britain?

    From the newspaper, I saw that the locomotives of the Shanghai Railway Bureau are also opening special express trains; in fact, all 600 million of us are driving special express trains.

    灯节偶感
    又是元宵节了，于是想到观灯，又于是想起小时的一次看龙灯舞。那五彩巨龙，起伏旋舞，直有跃跃欲上天的姿态。激人奋发。
    于是，不禁又想到目前的大跃进。行行、业业的人都在比先进、赶先进。你赶过了我，我便跃然直追，又赶过你，真是形势逼人，不容落后。此起彼伏的这形势，不正就像那龙灯在旋舞，而且你追我赶节节跃进，真也像一条活的巨龙。——英国的新闻记者，不就说我们是一条东方巨龙，紧追在英国后面的吗？
    从报纸上看到，上海铁路局的火车头，也在大开特别快车；其实，我们六亿人都是开特别快车的。
