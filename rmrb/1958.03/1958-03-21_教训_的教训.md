    The Lesson of "Lessons"
    Kong Sang

    We are now beginning a new war – a war against nature. On every front, including industry, agriculture, and transportation, millions upon millions of battles are taking place every moment, in close combat with nature. In this war, can we conquer the stubborn enemy and achieve a brilliant victory like in the social revolution?

    We are revolutionary optimists, and our answer is, of course, affirmative. We have always strategically despised all "powerful" enemies and all "serious" difficulties. We know that the enemy "nature" is not easy to conquer, but we are still full of confidence. If the Old Man of North Mountain could remove mountains, and Jingwei could fill the sea, what kind of enemy can't be overcome by the liberated Chinese people?

    However, the inevitable victory of the entire war against nature does not mean that we can underestimate every specific battle. On the road to conquering nature, due to our lack of knowledge and the fact that we haven't yet unraveled many mysteries of nature, we often encounter nature's fierce "resistance." Underestimating these specific battles can lead to setbacks and failures. And local setbacks and failures often affect the overall war against nature, delaying victory and requiring us to pay a higher price. Therefore, while strategically despising the enemy, we must be very cautious and humble tactically, adopting a scientific attitude and a diligent and practical attitude. In this way, we can conquer the difficulties that nature presents to us one by one, and achieve strategic victory more quickly.

    Nature will undoubtedly give us many difficulties. The question lies in people's attitude towards difficulties. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "The result of the struggle between the two opposing sides of a contradiction is always that they transform themselves into each other under certain conditions. Here, conditions are important." Difficulties can be transformed into non-difficulties, and non-difficulties can also be transformed into difficulties. Here, the condition is your attitude towards difficulties. The example of the Shaoxing Steel Plant vividly proves this truth. When the first blast furnace was ignited, they were unfamiliar with ironmaking technology. But they humbly accepted the help of experts, technicians, and skilled workers sent from Shanghai and Ma'anshan, and as a result, they successfully produced iron with good quality, and subsequent production went smoothly. When the second blast furnace was put into production, it should be said that their knowledge of ironmaking was much greater than before. However, because they became arrogant and did not respect science, "nature" gave them a lesson: almost all the molten iron in the furnace solidified, and facing this increasingly large iron block, they had to stop production.

    Jiang Hua, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, warned the cadres in Zhejiang Province to learn from the lesson of the Shaoxing Steel Plant when actively developing local industry. We say that this matter is not only of educational significance to the comrades in Zhejiang Province, but also to the comrades engaged in local industry. It is of utmost importance to all of us. It is related to the question of whether our war against nature will be won sooner or later, and whether the price paid will be more or less. At this moment when everyone is "ambitious and soaring," let us also maintain a clear head and firmly remember what Chairman Mao warned us:

    Humility makes one progress,
    Arrogance makes one fall behind.

    “教训”的教训
    孔桑
    我们现在正在开始一场新的战争——向自然界开战。在工业、农业、交通运输业等各个战线上，每时每刻都发生着千百万次同自然界短兵相接的战斗。在这场战争里，我们能不能征服顽强的敌人，像在社会革命中一样取得辉煌的胜利呢？
    我们是革命的乐观主义者，我们的回答当然是肯定的。我们从来就是在战略上藐视一切
  “强大”的敌人，藐视一切“严重”的艰难困苦。我们知道“自然”这个敌人并不容易征服，但是我们仍然充满着信心。愚公可以移山，精卫可以填海，在解放了的中国人民面前，还有什么样的敌人不能战胜？
    然而，同自然界的整个战争的必然胜利，并不意味着我们可以轻视每一个具体的战斗。在征服自然界的道路上，由于我们的知识不足，对自然界的许多奥秘还没有识破，因此常常会遇到自然界的剧烈的“抵抗”。轻视这种具体的战斗，就会使我们遭到挫折和失败。而局部的挫折和失败，往往就会使对自然界进行战争的整体受到影响，以致使胜利延缓，并且支付较多的代价。因此，我们在战略上藐视敌人的同时，必须在战术上十分谨慎虚心，采取科学的态度，苦钻实干的态度。这样，我们就可以一个一个地征服那些自然界给我们的困难，更快地取得战略上的胜利。
    自然界会给我们许多困难，这是肯定无疑的。问题在于人们对困难的态度。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。”困难能够转化为不困难，不困难也能转化为困难，这里，条件就是你对待困难的态度。绍兴钢铁厂的例子再生动不过地证明了这个真理。在第一号高炉点火的时候，他们对炼铁技术是生疏的。但是他们虚心接受了上海和马鞍山等地派来的专家、技师和熟练工人的帮助，结果顺利地出了铁，质量很好，以后的生产情况也一直很正常。到第二号高炉投入生产的时候，应当说他们炼铁的知识比过去多得多了。但是，由于他们变得骄傲起来，对于科学也不尊重了，于是，“自然”就给了他们一个教训：炉里的铁水几乎全部凝结，面对着这个越来越大的铁块，不得不停止生产。
    浙江省委书记江华同志告诫浙江省的干部，在积极发展地方工业的时候，要好好接受绍兴钢铁厂的教训。我们说，这件事情不仅对浙江省的同志们有教育意义，也不仅对从事地方工业的同志们有教育意义。它对我们大家都有极其重要的意义。它是关系到我们同自然界所进行的这场战争，胜利得迟或早、代价付得多或少的问题。在目前大家“壮志凌云、气冲斗牛”的时刻，让我们同时保持清醒的头脑，牢牢记住毛主席所告诫我们的话吧：
    虚心使人进步，
    骄傲使人落后。
