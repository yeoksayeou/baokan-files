    Ironclad Proof
    Rightist ringleaders like Zhang Bojun and Huang Shaohong once clamored wildly that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign was done "badly." The film "Ironclad Proof" powerfully refutes their nonsense once again with living facts.
    From the film, we can see piles of guns, radios, and all kinds of bombs seized from the hands of counter-revolutionaries. We can also see a large number of hidden special agents and blood-debt-ridden murderers who were purged during the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign, such as Xie Xin, the counter-revolutionary whom Huang Shaohong once supported; Wang Zhennan, the murderer who killed Comrade Li Dazhao, and so on.
    In the film, we can also see the real situation of special agents being unable to escape the sharp eyes of the people and being arrested on the spot.
    The ironclad proof is like a mountain, and the Rightists cannot deny it. The facts show that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement was not done "badly," but very well. (Jian Yan)

    铁证如山
    右派头子章伯钧、黄绍竑之流曾经大肆叫嚣说肃反搞“糟”了。影片“铁证”用活生生的事实再次有力地驳斥了他们的谰言。
    从影片中，我们可以看到从反革命分子手中缴获的成堆的枪炮、电台和各式各样的炸弹。也可以看到在肃反中被清出来的大批潜藏的特务分子和血债累累的杀人凶手，例如黄绍竑曾为她撑腰的反革命分子谢昕；杀害李大钊同志的凶手王振南等等。
    在影片中还可以看到特务分子逃不出人民雪亮的眼睛，因而当场被捕的实况。
    铁证如山，不容右派分子们抵赖。事实说明肃反运动不是搞“糟”了，而是好得很。　（兼言）
