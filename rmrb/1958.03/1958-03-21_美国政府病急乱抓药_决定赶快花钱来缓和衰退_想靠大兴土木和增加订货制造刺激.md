Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: The U.S. government is hastily taking measures in an attempt to alleviate the impact of the deepening economic recession.

U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower cancelled his weekly press conference on the 19th to discuss once again with his economic advisors and relevant department heads how to deal with the recession. Following this discussion, the U.S. government announced that it had decided to "spend money quickly" to accelerate public works projects totaling more than $2.25 billion. It also decided to provide the "depressed" auto industry with $100 million in military vehicle orders within the next thirty days to stimulate employment in the five states severely hit by the recession: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In addition, Eisenhower is holding talks with the governors of several U.S. states to discuss unemployment relief.

The U.S. Congress is also hurriedly going through the legislative procedures for some so-called "anti-recession" measures. On the 19th, the House of Representatives passed two bills, already approved by the Senate, that allocate $1.85 billion to construct housing and require the government to accelerate military construction projects totaling $1.5 billion.

The measures taken by the U.S. ruling group reflect their extreme anxiety about the economic outlook. According to U.S. news agencies, the severity of the economic recession has now caused "turmoil" in Washington, and "the White House is now less optimistic about the timing of economic recovery than Eisenhower was at the beginning of last month." It is pointed out that the decline in U.S. industrial production during this recession has already exceeded the levels of the recessions in 1949 and 1953-1954. In agriculture, in order to reduce surplus products, the U.S. cultivated land area has been reduced to its lowest level in more than forty years. Unemployed workers in Hartford, Connecticut, held a demonstration rally demanding that the U.S. government immediately pass relief bills. The signs held by the crowd read: "We want work. Hungry children can't sleep."

    美国政府病急乱抓药
    决定赶快花钱来缓和衰退
    想靠大兴土木和增加订货制造刺激
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在急忙采取一些措施，企图缓和日益深重的经济衰退的冲击。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔已经在19日取消了每周例行的记者招待会，而同他的经济顾问和有关部门的负责人再次讨论如何应付衰退的问题。在这次讨论以后，美国政府宣布，它已经决定“赶快花钱”，以加速进行总数二十二亿五千余万美元的公共工程计划。它还决定在今后三十天内向“萧条”的汽车工业提供一亿美元的购买军用车辆的订货单，以便刺激受到衰退严重袭击的伊利诺斯、印第安纳、密执安、俄亥俄和宾夕法尼亚五个州的就业。此外，艾森豪威尔还正在同美国几个州的州长举行会谈，讨论失业救济问题。
    美国国会也在匆匆就一些所谓“反衰退”的措施进行立法手续。众议院19日通过了两项已经得到参议院同意的法案，决定拨出十八亿五千万美元来兴建住宅，并且要求政府加速进行总数达十五亿美元的军事建筑计划。
    美国统治集团采取这些措施，反映了他们对于经济前景的极度不安。据美国通讯社报道，经济衰退的严重性目前已经在华盛顿引起“骚动”，“白宫现在对经济复原的时间，已经不像艾森豪威尔在上月初所表现的那样乐观”。据指出，美国工业生产在这一次衰退中的下降程度已经超过了1949年和1953—1954年两次衰退的水平。在农业方面，为了要减少剩余产品，美国的耕地面积已经减少到四十多年来的最低水平。美国康?狄格州哈特福德市的失业工人举行示威性集会，要求美国政府立即通过救济法案。群众高举着的标语是：“我们要工作。饥饿的孩子睡不着。”
