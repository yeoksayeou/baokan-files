Capitalist Countries Unemployment Figures

According to a report in the London "Times" on March 4th, under the shadow of the economic recession in the capitalist world, the number of unemployed people in many capitalist industrial countries has greatly increased this year compared to last year. According to published materials, the increase (or decrease in individual countries) in the number of unemployed in fourteen capitalist industrial countries is as follows:

The "Times" also acknowledged that the above figures do not represent the total number of unemployed because many countries do not include underemployed or unregistered unemployed persons in their statistics. For example, Japan has approximately five million underemployed workers who are not counted among the unemployed. France and Italy do not count unregistered unemployed persons. The U.S. unemployment figures do not include unemployed workers who are not covered by unemployment insurance.

Editor's Note: According to U.S. officials, the number of unemployed in the United States reached 5.1 million in February.

    资本主义国家失业人数
    据3月4日伦敦“泰晤士报”报道，在资本主义世界经济衰退的阴影下，今年许多资本主义工业国家的失业人数都比去年大大增加。根据已发表的材料，十四个资本主义工业国家失业人数的增长（个别国家减少）情况如下：
    （附图表）
    “泰晤士报”也承认，由于许多国家没有把半失业或未登记的失业人数统计在内，以上并不是全部失业人数。例如，日本大约有五百万半失业者没有算在失业人数内。法国和意大利都没有算未登记的失业人数。美国的失业人数没有包括那些未经过失业保险的失业工人在内。
    编者按：据美国官员透露，2月份美国失业人数已达到五百一十万人。
