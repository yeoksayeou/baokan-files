Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th – Three thousand industrial and commercial youth in Shanghai held a Socialist Leap Forward rally at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building on the evening of the 26th. They pledged to complete their transformation within three years and strive to achieve self-reliance within two years. The conference proposed to launch a "four competitions" campaign among the city's industrial and commercial youth, starting immediately, to compare the speed of ideological transformation, the contribution in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, the quality of labor training, and the thriftiness of life, in order to accelerate self-transformation.

The youth participating in the conference were filled with enthusiasm, and the venue was covered with various pledges. Many speakers at the meeting were excited by the bright future of the motherland and expressed their determination to abandon exploitation earlier and transform themselves into self-reliant laborers.
