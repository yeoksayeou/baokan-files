Xinhua News Agency, Sinŭiju, March 19th. A glorious artillery unit from the first batch of returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army received a warm welcome from more than 3,000 Korean people when passing through Sinŭiju. This artillery unit suppressed enemy firepower with extremely accurate and fierce artillery fire in the famous Battle of Shihyondong North Mountain in the spring of 1953, destroying enemy fortifications and opening the road to victory for the infantry.

When the peace train carrying the heroic artillerymen and mighty cannons arrived here amidst cheers, the Korean workers, farmers, and women waiting at the station surrounded the Volunteer Army artillerymen, asking them to tell stories of battle and sign autographs as souvenirs. Many Korean elementary school students climbed onto the train, putting red scarves and big red flowers on the cannons. Then, the well-wishers and Volunteer Army artillerymen engaged in song and dance festivities.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, March 19th. The people of Andong City warmly welcomed a certain artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning in triumph. When the train carrying the artillery heroes, emblazoned with large slogans such as "Salute to the People of the Motherland," arrived at the station, the welcoming crowd repeatedly cheered them enthusiastically.

The heroes of a certain Collective Third-Class Merit Company, which had received seventeen award banners, were immediately swept into the singing and dancing crowd as soon as they stepped out of the train. This company, in the Battle of Shihyondong North Mountain in Korea, fired seventy shells from two cannons in six minutes, destroying seventeen enemy bunkers, powerfully supporting the infantry's victorious offensive.

More than 120 residents of Badao Street, Yuanbao District, Andong City, walked more than ten li late last night to rush to the station to welcome this Volunteer Army heroic artillery unit passing through Andong on its way to the interior of the motherland.

    英雄高唱凯歌归
    志愿军一支炮兵回到安东
    新华社新义州19日电　中国人民志愿军首批归国部队的一支光荣的炮兵部队经过新义州时，受到当地三千多朝鲜人民的热情欢迎。这支炮兵部队在1953年春天著名的石岘洞北山反击战中，以极其准确和猛烈的炮火压制敌人火力，摧毁敌人的工事，为步兵打开胜利的道路。
    当和平列车载着英雄的炮兵和威武的大炮在欢呼声中到达这里的时候，迎候在车站上的朝鲜工人、农民和妇女们围住志愿军炮手，请他们讲战斗故事和签名留念。许多朝鲜小学生攀上列车，给大炮带上了红领巾和大红花。接着，欢送的群众和志愿军炮兵们进行了歌舞联欢。
    新华社安东19日电　安东市人民热烈欢迎凯旋归国的中国人民志愿军某炮兵部队。当炮兵英雄们乘坐的写着“向祖国人民致敬”等大字标语的列车到达车站时，欢迎的人群一再向他们热烈欢呼。
    曾经得过十七面奖旗的某集体三等功臣连的英雄们刚刚走出车厢，就被欢迎的人们涌进歌舞的行列里。这个连曾经在朝鲜石岘洞北山反击战中，六分钟内用两门炮发射了七十发炮弹，摧毁敌人十七个地堡，有力地支援了步兵的胜利进攻。
    安东市元宝区八道街的一百二十多名居民，昨天深夜步行十多里路赶到车站，前来欢迎这支经过安东前往祖国内地的志愿军英雄炮兵部队。
