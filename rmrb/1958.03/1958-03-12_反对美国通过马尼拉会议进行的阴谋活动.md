    On March 10th, our government issued a statement exposing and condemning the conspiracy activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Manila Conference. Our government firmly opposes the United States' attempt to use the Manila Conference to further interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries, and fully supports Indonesia's just struggle to maintain its independence and sovereignty. It firmly opposes the United States' intensified arms expansion and war preparations in the Asian and Pacific region, the expansion of nuclear weapons and rocket base networks, and the aggravation of tensions, and actively advocates the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone of peace in Asia and the conclusion of collective peace pacts. This statement not only expresses the peaceful will of the 600 million Chinese people, but also reflects the strong desire for peace of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region.
    Since its establishment, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been a tool for the United States to pursue arms expansion, war preparations, and colonial aggression policies in Southeast Asia. Under the black guise of so-called "joint defense" and "opposition to communist subversive activities," the United States has used this aggressive group not only to place the three Asian member states under its control, but also to constantly and crudely interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. On the eve of the Manila Conference, the United States particularly directed this spearhead of interference at Indonesia, attempting to subvert the Indonesian government or force Indonesia to abandon its peaceful and independent policy and drag it into an aggressive military bloc. To achieve this despicable goal, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles recently made two public appearances to slander and attack the Indonesian government. The U.S. Seventh Fleet even conducted large-scale exercises in waters close to Indonesian territorial waters to intimidate Indonesia. Recently, three warships of the Seventh Fleet even sailed to waters near Sumatra to demonstrate. At the same time, the United States has intensified its manipulation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, using Singapore and Manila as bases, constantly helping rebels with weapons and "instructors." Therefore, as the Indonesian "Eastern Star" editorial of March 10th said, the aggressive activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have threatened Indonesia's independence and its independent policy.
    According to news from various sources, the United States is trying to use the Manila Conference to plan a more sinister conspiracy against Indonesia. According to Reuters, Philippine Acting Foreign Minister Serrano said on March 9th that the Manila Conference would "discuss" the situation in Indonesia. Obviously, because the United States has seen that the rebels it supports are becoming increasingly untenable in the face of the condemnation of the Indonesian people, it is eager to drag more member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization into the water, further interfere in Indonesia, and support the rebels. This attempt by the United States cannot but be met with even stronger resistance from the Indonesian people, and it is also absolutely unacceptable to all peace-loving countries in Asia. The Chinese government's statement of March 10th reiterated that the Chinese people firmly support the struggle of the Indonesian government and people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and to oppose foreign interference and subversive conspiracies. The United States must immediately stop any interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, otherwise it must be fully responsible for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.
    The United States' practice of roping in Asian members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in Indonesia has crudely violated the United Nations Charter and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference. The Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan are all participating countries in the Asian-African Bandung Conference and should, of course, abide by the obligations they assumed at the Bandung Conference and refuse to interfere in the internal affairs of another Asian country together with the United States. If someone is willing to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for the United States, the result will never be of any benefit to themselves.
    Another major conspiracy planned by the United States using the Manila Conference is to expand its network of nuclear weapons and rocket bases in the Asian and Pacific region. The United States has already deployed atomic weapons and rockets on some islands in the Pacific Ocean, Okinawa and mainland Japan, South Korea, and our territory of Taiwan. Now, it also wants to establish nuclear weapons and rocket bases within the territory of the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. If this conspiracy of the United States succeeds, it will only increase the risk of nuclear war and seriously endanger the peace and security of the Asian and Pacific region. Moreover, it is not difficult to understand that if the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia group accept U.S. nuclear weapons and rockets, it will have unimaginable consequences once a war breaks out. However, despite this, there are still people in these countries who are willing to serve the United States. Philippine President Garcia expressed his welcome to the United States to establish missile bases in the Philippines through the Manila Treaty Organization. Garcia's attitude of willingly acting as a victim of U.S. nuclear war is clearly incompatible with the vital interests of the Filipino people.
    The people of Asia were the first to suffer from atomic bombs, so they have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against nuclear weapons. Since March 1st of this year, under the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, a large-scale movement against the United States' testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific and condemning the United States' intensified nuclear arms race activities has been launched in the Asian-African region. Some well-known political and social figures in Asian and African countries have put forward proposals to support the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Indian Prime Minister Nehru suggested not to establish rocket bases in Asian countries. Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, also proposed turning Asia and Japan into nuclear-free zones. Even the broad masses of the people and righteous social activists in the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are firmly opposed to the establishment of U.S. nuclear weapons and rocket bases on their own territories. It is precisely based on this desire for peace and security that our government solemnly put forward the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone of peace in Asia and to further conclude collective peace pacts in this statement. This is entirely in line with the common interests of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific region.
    The current mainstream of the international situation is that the people of all countries are eagerly demanding to resolve outstanding international issues through consultation, to stop the imperialist nuclear weapons arms race, and to realize the peaceful coexistence of the people of all countries. Faced with this mainstream, U.S. imperialism is painstakingly trying to salvage its bankrupt "position of strength" policy and military bloc policy. From the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Treaty Organization since last winter, to the Manila Conference held this time, the United States wants to strengthen the activities of these aggressive groups in order to block the tide of peace. However, these activities of the United States do not prove its strength, but on the contrary show that this is just a struggle. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, like other military aggression groups, has long been notorious. Even the United States International News Service admits: "The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is either making people angry, or being ridiculed and despised everywhere in the East." Therefore, no matter how the United States cheers, it is futile. As long as the people of Asian countries strengthen unity and persist in struggle, we will surely defeat the conspiracy of the Manila Conference, continue to advance the victorious cause of the independence and peace of the people of Asian countries, and make the land of Asia a land of peace, the sky of Asia a sky of peace, and the ocean of Asia an ocean of peace!

### 反对美国通过马尼拉会议进行的阴谋活动

    反对美国通过马尼拉会议进行的阴谋活动
    3月10日，我国政府发表声明揭露和谴责了东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议的阴谋活动。我国政府坚决反对美国企图利用马尼拉会议进一步干涉东南亚国家内政，而完全支持印度尼西亚维护独立和主权的正义斗争；坚决反对美国在亚洲和太平洋地区加紧扩军备战，扩大核武器和火箭基地网，加剧紧张局势，积极主张在亚洲建立无原子武器的和平地区和缔结集体和平公约。这个声明不仅表达了六亿中国人民的和平意志，而且也反映了亚洲及太平洋地区各国人民对于和平的强烈愿望。
    东南亚条约组织自从成立以来，就是美国在东南亚推行扩军备战和殖民侵略政策的工具。美国利用这个侵略集团，在所谓“共同防御”和“反对共产主义颠覆活动”的黑色幌子下，不仅把三个亚洲成员国放在它的控制之下，而且不断地粗暴干涉东南亚国家的内政。在马尼拉会议前夕，美国特别把这个干涉的矛头指向印度尼西亚，企图颠覆印度尼西亚的政府，或者迫使印度尼西亚放弃它的和平独立政策，并把它拖进侵略性的军事集团中。为了达到这种卑鄙的目的，美国国务卿杜勒斯最近曾两次公开出面发表诽谤和攻击印度尼西亚政府的言论。美国的第七舰队更在靠近印度尼西亚领海的水域，举行了恫吓印度尼西亚的大规模演习。最近，第七舰队的三艘军舰竟又驶往苏门答腊附近海面示威。同时，美国变本加厉地操纵东南亚条约组织，以新加坡和马尼拉为据点，不断以武器和“教官”帮助叛乱分子。因此，正如印度尼西亚“东星报”3月10日的社论所说，东南亚条约组织的侵略性的活动已经威胁印度尼西亚的独立和它的独立政策。
    根据各方面透露的消息，美国正想利用马尼拉会议策划一个进一步反对印度尼西亚的险恶阴谋。据路透社报道，菲律宾代理外交部长塞兰诺在3月9日就谈到，这次马尼拉会议将会“讨论”印度尼西亚的局势。很显然，由于美国已经看到它所支持的叛乱分子在印度尼西亚人民的声讨中已经越来越站不住脚了，所以它就迫不及待地想把东南亚条约组织更多的成员国都拖下水，进一步干涉印度尼西亚，给叛乱分子撑腰。美国的这种企图不能不遭到印度尼西亚人民的更加强烈的反抗，而且也是亚洲一切爱好和平国家所绝对不能允许的。我国政府3月10日的声明重申，中国人民是坚决支持印度尼西亚政府和人民为维护国家独立主权、为反对外来干涉和颠覆阴谋而进行的斗争。美国必须立即停止对印度尼西亚内政的任何干涉，否则它就必须对于由此产生的一切严重后果完全负责。
    美国拉拢东南亚条约组织亚洲成员国干涉印度尼西亚的作法，粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章和万隆会议的决议。菲律宾、泰国、巴基斯坦都是亚非万隆会议的参加国，当然应该遵守它们在万隆会议上所承担的义务，拒绝同美国一起干涉另一个亚洲国家的内政。如果有人甘愿替美国“火中取栗”，结果对自己决不可能有丝毫好处。
    美国利用马尼拉会议所策划的另一个重大阴谋，就是想扩大它在亚洲和太平洋地区核武器和火箭基地网。美国已经把原子武器和火箭安置在太平洋的一些岛屿、冲绳和日本本土、南朝鲜和我国领土台湾等地。现在，它还想在东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员国境内建立核武器和火箭基地。美国的这个阴谋如能得逞，只会增加核战争的危险性，严重地危及亚洲和太平洋地区的和平与安全。而且，不难理解，东南亚集团的亚洲成员国如果接受美国核武器和火箭，那么当战争一旦发生时，将造成不堪设想的后果。但是，尽管如此，在这些国家中居然还有人愿为美国效劳。菲律宾总统加西亚就表示欢迎美国通过马尼拉条约组织在菲律宾建立导弹基地。加西亚的这种甘愿充当美国核战争牺牲者的态度，显然是同菲律宾人民的切身利益水火不相容的。
    亚洲人民是最先遭受原子弹灾害的，因此他们一直站在反对核武器斗争的最前线。从今年3月1日以来，在亚非人民团结大会的号召下，亚非地区已经掀起了一个反对美国在太平洋上试验核武器、谴责美国加紧核备战活动的声势浩大的运动。亚非国家的一些著名政治和社会人士纷纷提出支持禁止核武器的主张。印度总理尼赫鲁建议不在亚洲国家建立火箭基地。日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三也提出了把亚洲和日本变为无原子区的主张。就是东南亚条约组织亚洲成员国的广大人民和有正义感的社会活动家们，也都坚决反对在本国领土上建立美国的核武器和火箭基地。我国政府正是根据这种渴望和平和安全的愿望，在这次声明中郑重地提出了在亚洲建立无原子武器的和平地区和进一步缔结集体和平公约的主张。这是完全符合亚洲和太平洋地区各国人民的共同利益的。
    当前国际局势的主流是：各国人民热烈要求通过协商解决国际上尚未解决的问题，要求制止帝国主义的核武器备战活动，要求实现各国人民之间的和平共处。在这个主流面前，美帝国主义枉费心机地企图挽回它那已经破了产的“实力地位”政策和军事集团的政策。美国从去冬以来召开北大西洋公约组织的巴黎会议和巴格达条约组织的安卡拉会议，直到这次召开马尼拉会议，都是想加强这些侵略集团的活动，以阻挡和平潮流。但是，美国的这些活动并不证明它的强大，相反却说明这只是一种挣扎而已。东南亚条约组织和其它军事侵略集团一样，早已经声名狼籍了。连美国国际新闻社也承认：“东南亚条约组织在东方各处不是使人愤怒，就是受人嘲笑和轻视”。因此，美国无论怎样打气也是徒劳的。只要亚洲各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，我们就一定能打败马尼拉会议的阴谋，把亚洲各国人民的独立与和平的胜利事业继续向前推进，使亚洲的土地成为和平的土地，亚洲的天空成为和平的天空，亚洲的海洋成为和平的海洋！
