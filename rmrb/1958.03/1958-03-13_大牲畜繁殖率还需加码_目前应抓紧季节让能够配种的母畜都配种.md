    (Reported by our correspondent Li Yi) The breeding season for draft animals is here. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that if the breeding and propagation of draft animals are not vigorously pursued this spring, the goal of having a sufficient number of strong draft animals in each agricultural cooperative within five to ten years will not be achieved, and the great leap forward in agricultural production will be affected.

    The Ministry of Agriculture requires all localities to launch a high tide of breeding and developing large livestock with the greatest determination and effort starting in 1958.

    The reporter learned from various sources that solving the shortage of animal power is one of the most pressing problems in current agricultural production. At the end of 1957, the number of large livestock nationwide only increased by 10% compared to 1952, and actually decreased by more than one million head compared to 1956. Not only is the number of draft animals insufficient, but the quality is also poor, with many old animals and few strong and young animals. The shortage of animal power has become a prominent and acute problem in the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    Late spring and early summer is the breeding season for draft animals. The Ministry of Agriculture hopes that all localities will immediately take action and make every effort to breed all breedable female animals. Only in this way will it be possible to increase the number of usable draft animals in the later period of the Second Five-Year Plan. Otherwise, a historical mistake will be made, and the 14th article of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) regarding the breeding of draft animals will be difficult to achieve.

    Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture issued the "Opinions on Actively Developing Large Livestock in 1958" to all localities, requiring them to actively develop mainly through their own breeding. According to the plans of various provinces and regions, the number of large livestock will increase by 3,893,000 head this year, only a 4.6% increase compared to last year. Among them, the provinces with an increase of more than 7% are Hubei and Anhui. Some provinces and regions plan to increase only 3%-7%, and the growth plan of individual provinces is less than 3%, and some have no increase or decrease. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that the growth rate of large livestock in 1953 and 1954 was 5.6%, and the planned growth rate for this year is only 4.6%, so it requires all localities to reconsider the development targets.

    The Ministry of Agriculture requires all localities and agricultural cooperatives to properly arrange the contradiction between labor and breeding, so as to ensure that breeding and labor are not delayed; it requires all localities to pay attention to solving the problem of insufficient number of breeding males, and hopes that all state-owned farms and institutions and troops will support agricultural cooperatives with breeding males.

### 大牲畜繁殖率还需加码  目前应抓紧季节让能够配种的母畜都配种

    大牲畜繁殖率还需加码
    目前应抓紧季节让能够配种的母畜都配种
    本报讯　记者黎益报道：耕畜配种的季节到了。农业部认为：如果今年春天再不抓紧耕畜的配种繁殖工作，在五年到十年内使每个农业社有足够数量的强壮耕畜这一要求就作不到，就要影响农业生产大跃进。
    农业部要求各地从1958年起，以最大的决心和努力掀起繁殖发展大牲畜的高潮。
    记者从各方面了解：解决畜力不足是当前农业生产上一个最迫切的问题。1957年底全国大牲畜数只比1952年增加了10％，比1956年反而减少了一百多万头。耕畜不仅数量不足，而且质量差，老畜多，壮畜幼畜都少。畜力不足的现象，在农业生产大跃进中成了突出尖锐的问题。
    春末夏初是耕畜配种的季节。农业部希望各地立即动手，尽一切努力争取把能够配种的母畜都配好。只有这样，到第二个五年计划的后期才可能增加一批可以使用的耕畜。否则就犯了历史性的错误，农业发展纲要（修正草案）十四条关于繁殖耕畜的要求就难于作到。
    最近，农业部向各地发出了“关于1958年积极发展大牲畜的意见”，要求各地主要依靠自己繁殖来积极发展。按各省区的计划，今年大牲畜将增加三百八十九点三万头，比去年才增长4.6％。其中增长7％以上的省有湖北、安徽，有些省区计划只增长3％—7％，个别省的增长计划不到3％，还有不增不减的。农业部认为：1953和1954两年大牲畜增长的速度为5.6％，今年各地计划增长的速度仅只4.6％，因此要求各地重新考虑发展指标。
    农业部要求各地和农业社妥善安排使役和繁殖的矛盾，作到配种使役两不误；要求各地注意解决种公畜不足的问题，希望各国营农牧场和机关部队以种公畜支援农业社。
