	The Immersive Feeling
	—Watching Soviet Cinerama Films
	Hua Junwu
	People who have been to the Soviet Union several times always have the feeling that they can always see something new each time they go to Moscow, such as the model of the artificial satellite and the cinerama film that can be seen in Moscow now. The cinerama film is shown in the newly built Peace Cinema; it is on the same street as the Moscow Circus. This cinema is really big, without a balcony, and the seats extend backward on a slope. The host said that it can accommodate 1,300 people. The entire cinema auditorium is circular. During the screening, three projectors from the left, center, and right directions behind the audience simultaneously project the film onto a curved screen 30 meters wide and 11 meters high in front of the audience.
	The title of the first cinerama film is "Our Motherland is Vast and Wide". The film starts from the outskirts of Moscow and takes the audience to other cities, villages, rivers and seas, skies and lands of the Soviet Union. It takes us to the scaffolding of construction sites, it takes us to the Kuibyshev power station, and it also lets us follow the rafts through the rapids of the Tisa River in Transcarpathia. If I had to say what the first feeling after watching a cinerama film is, then I can only say that it is like being there. We are speeding along with the train, and the trees and fields on both sides quickly fly past our field of vision; if we encounter a reckless yacht on the lake, the very high waves will splash in our faces; if the movie is filmed on an airplane, when the camera follows the airplane diving, the audience's hearts will also become nervous. The most interesting thing is when a car is speeding on a winding road on the mountainside, I am extremely nervous, afraid that the driver will be careless and the car will fall into the canyon...
	Not only are the eyes nervous, but the ears are also nervous. When a car passes under a bridge, a train is passing over the bridge, and the rumbling sound of the train also comes from the loudspeakers above the audience's heads; the movie takes the audience to the fountains of the Peterhof Palace in Leningrad, and the water columns sprayed from the surrounding statues make a rustling sound, and the water splashes seem to be falling in front, behind, left and right of the audience.
	Our translator, Comrade Yura, joked with me before the film screening, saying that a bomb was going to fall from our heads. I know that Soviet movies would not play such jokes on the audience, but if in the future in cinerama films, there are some Chinese people setting off firecrackers and *ertijiao* [double-kick firecrackers] (note), I think the audience will definitely be startled.
	[Note] *Ertijiao* is called *shuangxiang* in the south, which is a type of firecracker that makes a very loud sound.

    身临其境的感觉
    ——看苏联的全景电影
    华君武
    去过几次苏联的人总有这么一种感觉，每次到莫斯科，准能看到一点新东西，比方说现在在莫斯科就可以看到人造卫星的模型和全景电影。全景电影是在新建的和平电影院放映的；它和莫斯科的马戏剧场在同一条街上。这个电影院真大，没有楼座，座位在斜坡上向后延伸。主人说可以容纳一千三百人。整个电影放映厅是圆形的。放映时，在观众的后边左、中、右三个方向的三架放映机，同时向观众前边的一块宽三十公尺，高十一公尺的弧形银幕放映电影。
    第一部全景电影的片名是“我们祖国辽阔广大”。影片从莫斯科近郊开始，一直把观众带到苏联其它的城市、农村、河流和海洋，天空和地上。它把我们引到建筑工地的高架上，它把我们带到古比雪夫的发电站上，它也让我们跟着木筏流过外喀尔巴阡的底萨河的急流。如果说看了全景电影首先的感觉是什么，那我想只能说如同身临其境。我们跟着火车飞奔，两旁的树木、田野就很快地在我们的视野两旁飞过；如果我们在湖上遇到一只莽撞的游艇，溅得很高的浪花就会扑面而来；如果电影是在飞机上拍摄，当镜头跟着飞机俯冲时，观众的心也紧张起来。最有趣的是一部汽车在山腰上的弯弯曲曲的公路上急驰的时候，我极其紧张，生怕司机一不小心，汽车掉进峡谷里去……
    不但眼睛紧张，耳朵也很紧张。当一部汽车从桥梁下通过的时候，桥上正开过一列火车，火车的隆隆声也从观众头上的扩音器里发出来；电影把观众带到列宁格勒夏宫的喷水池里，四周雕像喷出的水柱，发出哗哗的水声，水花好像正落在观众的前后左右。
    我们的翻译尤拉同志在电影放映前和我开玩笑，他说从我们的头顶上将要落下一颗炸弹来。我知道苏联的电影不会和观众开这种玩笑，但是如果将来在全景电影里，有一些中国人在放鞭炮和二踢脚（注），我想观众准要猛然吓一跳的。
      〔注〕二踢脚在南方叫双响，是一种发声极大的爆竹。
