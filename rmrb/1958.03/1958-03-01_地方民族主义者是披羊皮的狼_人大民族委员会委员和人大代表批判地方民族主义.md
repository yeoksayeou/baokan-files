Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Resolutely oppose local nationalism, and further consolidate the unity and solidarity of the great family of the motherland. This is the unanimous determination expressed by the members attending the Fifth Enlarged Meeting of the Nationalities Committee of the First National People's Congress and the deputies to the National People's Congress in their speeches. After listening to the report by Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, they unanimously agreed that it is entirely necessary to launch a rectification and socialist education movement focusing on opposing nationalism in minority areas at present.

Committee member Patikhan Sugurbayev (Kazakh) said: The broad masses of the people of Xinjiang protect the Communist Party, their liberator and creator of a happy life, as they protect their own eyes. No matter how vicious the conspiracies of the local nationalists are, the people advancing on the socialist road will not be fooled.

Xirao Gyatso (Tibetan), Ji Jinmei (Tibetan), and Banda Duoji (Tibetan), three committee members, exposed the conspiracy of a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet who, under the guise of nationalism, are engaged in activities aimed at "independence." Xirao Gyatso said that those who have sided with imperialism are the scum of the Tibetan people. Our country has great hope and a bright future, and those in our country who believe in religion love the motherland. Ji Jinmei said that a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet are妄图(trying in vain) to rely on the help of imperialism to make Tibet retrace the old path of being enslaved by imperialism, which the Tibetan people resolutely oppose. Banda Duoji said that separatist elements are enemies of socialism, and if they do not turn back in time, they will surely be spurned by the people and crushed by the torrent of revolution.

Many people, based on their personal experiences in their speeches, explained that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the assistance of the Han people are guarantees for the rapid development and prosperity of all ethnic minorities, and they used facts to refute the fallacies of local nationalists. Committee member Guoji Mugu (Yi) said that the Yi people often fought feuds in the past. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the implementation of democratic reforms focused on abolishing the slave system, liberating slaves, and distributing land, has the people's lives been greatly improved, and the Yi people have also been united internally. People's Representative Dao Youliang (Dai) said that the economic construction and cultural and educational undertakings in the Xishuangbanna area have greatly developed. This year, a highway will be built within the territory, and the state's investment in this highway is equivalent to seven times the total agricultural income of the Xishuangbanna area. Without the leadership of the Party and the unified and united family of the motherland, and without the help of the Han people, such rapid development would not be possible. Committee member Zhao Shitong (Zhuang) said that without the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the Han people, we would be retracing the old path of being oppressed by imperialism. Luo Wencai (Miao), a deputy to the National People's Congress, talked about the high mountainous areas in Sichuan Province, where various ethnic groups live together. In the past, they were poor and miserable, and could only grow corn, potatoes, etc. Now, even double-cropping rice and peanuts have been planted on the mountains. This is because of the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the Han people. Committee member Wulan (Mongolian) said: Local nationalists among the ethnic minorities, like wolves in sheep's clothing, their shameless conspiracies to undermine national unity and the unification of the motherland are destined to go bankrupt completely.

Chen Yongkang (Buyi), Yang Hanxian (Miao), Guan Baojia (Mongolian), Suo Guanying (Tibetan), Ma Shaowen (Dongxiang), Ma Yuzhen (Hui), Songbu (Tu), and Xia Rongga Bu (Tibetan) also spoke at the meeting, and Xia Rongga Bu (Tibetan) submitted a written statement.

    地方民族主义者是披羊皮的狼
    人大民族委员会委员和人大代表批判地方民族主义
    据新华社28日讯　坚决反对地方民族主义，进一步巩固祖国大家庭的统一和团结，这是参加第一届全国人民代表大会民族委员会第五次扩大会议的委员和全国人民代表大会代表们，在发言中一致表示的决心。他们听取了民族事务委员会副主任汪锋的报告，一致认为当前在少数民族地区开展一个以反对民族主义为重点的整风和社会主义教育运动，是完全必要的。
    委员帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫（哈萨克族）说：新疆广大劳动人民像保护自己的眼珠一样地在保护着自己的解放者和幸福生活的创造者——共产党。无论地方民族主义者的阴谋多么毒辣，但是在社会主义大道上前进的人民是不会上当的。
    喜饶嘉错（藏族）、计晋美（藏族）、邦达多吉（藏族）等三位委员在发言中，揭露了西藏一小撮披着民族外衣的反动分子搞“独立”的阴谋活动。喜饶嘉错说，那些投靠帝国主义的人是藏族的败类。我们国家的希望很大，前途很光明，我国信仰宗教的人是热爱祖国的。计晋美说，西藏有一小撮反动分子妄图依靠帝国主义的帮助，使西藏重走受帝国主义奴役的老路，这是西藏人民坚决反对的。邦达多吉说，分离主义分子是社会主义的敌人，他们如不及早回头，必定会遭到人民的唾弃，会被革命的洪流击碎。
    许多人在发言中以亲身体会来说明：中国共产党的领导和汉族的帮助，是各少数民族能够得到迅速发展和繁荣的保证，他们用事实驳斥了地方民族主义者的谰言。委员果基木古（彝族）说，彝族内部过去经常打冤家。只有在共产党的领导下，实行了以废除奴隶制度、解放奴隶和分配土地为主要内容的民主改革，人民生活有很大改善，彝族内部也团结了。人民代表刀有良（傣族）说，西双版纳地区的经济建设和文化教育事业已经有很大发展，今年还要在境内兴修一条公路，国家给这条公路的投资就相当于西双版纳地区农业总收入的七倍。如果没有党的领导和统一团结的祖国大家庭，如果没有汉族的帮助，这样迅速的发展是不可能的。委员赵世同（僮族）说，离开了党的领导和汉族的帮助，那就是重走受帝国主义压迫的老路。全国人民代表大会代表罗文才（苗族）谈到四川省民族杂居的高山区，过去又穷又苦，只能种玉米、洋芋等，现在连双季稻、花生都上了山，这就是因为有党的领导和汉族的帮助。委员乌兰（蒙古族）说：少数民族中的地方民族主义者，像披着羊皮的狼一样，他们破坏民族团结和祖国统一的无耻阴谋，注定要彻底破产。
    在这次会议上发言的，还有陈永康（布依族）、杨汉先（苗族）、官保加（蒙古族）、索观瀛（藏族）、马绍文（东乡族）、马豫真（回族）、松布（土族）和夏茸尕布（藏族）作了书面发言。
