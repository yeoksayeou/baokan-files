    Comparison of Thrift, Comparison of Hygiene, Comparison of Service Quality
    Seventeen Employee Dining Halls in Beijing Propose a Competition
    (Our Newspaper) Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory, Beijing No. 1 Rubber Factory, the Summer Palace and other seventeen units' employee dining halls recently proposed to employee dining halls across the country to launch a friendly competition to ensure employees eat well and run dining halls thriftily.

    These seventeen units' employee dining halls are those that won the honorary title of Advanced Employee Dining Halls of Beijing in 1957. In their proposal, they put forward competition conditions for comparing thrift, comparing hygiene, and comparing service quality. In terms of thrift: on the basis of employees' fixed grain rations, achieve an average monthly saving of 7%-10% of grain. The average daily coal consumption per diner should be reduced to less than seven taels. The ratio of dining hall staff to diners should be: 1:50 or more for dining halls with more than 300 people, and 1:40 or more for dining halls with less than 300 people. Miscellaneous purchases and management costs, etc., should be reduced by more than 50% on the original basis. In terms of hygiene, the general requirement is to "eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene", ensuring that no food poisoning occurs. In terms of service quality, the catering staff should achieve three goods (good food quality, good service attitude, good hygiene) and one fast (fast food selling speed). (Su Ci Yuan)

    本报讯  国营北京广播器材厂、北京市橡胶一厂、颐和园等十七个单位的职工食堂最近向全国各职工食堂提出倡议，开展保证职工吃好、勤俭办食堂的友谊竞赛。
    这十七个单位的职工食堂是荣获1957年北京市先进职工食堂光荣称号的单位。他们在倡议中提出了比节约、比卫生、比服务质量的竞赛条件。节约方面：在职工粮食定量基础上作到平均每月节约粮食7％—10％。每一就食职工平均每日煤耗降到七两以下。食堂工作人员同就食职工的比例为：三百人以上的食堂达到1∶50以上，三百人以下的食堂达到1∶40以上。零星购置和管理费用等在原有基础上降低50％以上。卫生方面，总的要求是“除四害、讲卫生”，保证不发生食物中毒。服务质量方面，炊事人员要作到三好（饭菜质量好、服务态度好、卫生好）一快（卖饭速度快）。（苏慈媛）
