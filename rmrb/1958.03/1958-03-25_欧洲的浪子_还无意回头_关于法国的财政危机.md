"The Prodigal Son of Europe" Still Unwilling to Turn Back
——On the French Financial Crisis——
Yuan Xianlu

	“Prosperity” in Production, Bankruptcy in Finance

	“The Prodigal Son of Europe”—some Western newspapers use such a harsh name to refer to France. Their reason is that France's domestic consumption is so unrestrained that its finances are on the verge of bankruptcy even during this period of "prosperity" in production.

	Indeed, since 1954, the growth rate of French industrial production has been on par with West Germany in the capitalist world, far exceeding other countries. The following is a comparison of the industrial production indices of France, Britain, the United States, and West Germany:

		(1953 = 100)
	Year		France	Britain	United States	West Germany
	1954		110	107	93	112
	1955		120	113	104	129
	1956		133	112	107	139
	1957 (Projected)	145	113	106	147

	As for France's finances, they have been in a serious crisis since 1956. Both domestic and international balances of payments have been in deficit for the past two years, making them difficult to remedy.

	Is this because France's domestic consumption has grown excessively? The question cannot be answered in general terms. The following figures published by the French National Economic Audit Committee show the growth of various parts of France's domestic consumption in terms of the quantity of materials:

			1956	1957	Two-Year Total
	Private Consumption	5%	5.5%	10.8%
	Public Consumption	29%	9%	40.6%
	Fixed Capital		8%	8%	16.6%

	The so-called public consumption, which is growing at the forefront of domestic consumption, is mainly military expenditure, according to the above-mentioned committee. The reason why France's finances are in such a mess is very clear.

	However, the French government is trying to blame the French people. The three cabinets of Mollet, Bourgès-Maunoury, and Gaillard have all adopted fiscal policies that tighten the people's belts even further. As the medicine is not right for the disease, the financial situation continues to deteriorate. As a result, the Gaillard cabinet had to humbly beg for loans from abroad this year to barely make ends meet.

	Heavy Military Spending, Empty Treasury

	For French finances, the military expenditure burden brought about by the implementation of the North Atlantic policy was already heavy enough. Since the outbreak of the Algerian War, especially since its expansion in early 1956, France's military spending has increased dramatically. As a result, the fiscal deficit could not but expand accordingly.

		France's Military Spending and Fiscal Deficit
			(Unit: Billion Francs)
				1955	1956	1957
	Military Spending		1,085	1,125	1,420
	Of which, Algerian War Expenses	48	315	390
	Fiscal Deficit		714	99	5,957

	It should be noted that the above-mentioned officially published figures have been greatly reduced. For example, according to the materials of the French progressive newspaper "Libération," the actual war expenses in Algeria for the past three years have been 272 billion, 619 billion, and 678 billion francs, respectively. Total military spending in 1957 is estimated to actually approach 1.5 trillion francs.

	How does the French government make up for the fiscal deficit?

	Issuing banknotes is the most convenient way. France's hyperinflation has long been very serious, but the amount of paper money issued still increased by 261 billion francs in 1956; the growth in 1957, according to the estimate of the Finance Committee of the Senate of the Republic, may be 550 billion francs.

	Issuing public debt is another idea. Finance Minister Ramadier of the Mollet cabinet issued 434 billion francs of public debt in 1956 alone. However, the annual interest rate of 5% on public debt is a significant burden on future finances. Moreover, when public debt was reissued in March 1957, this route was already impassable, and the sales volume was only 83 billion, far below the government's expectations.

	As a result, the French government mainly relied on cutting budgets and increasing taxes in 1957 to cope with the difficulties. This finally reduced the actual result of the fiscal deficit from 1.5 trillion francs to the current 900+ billion francs.

	The budget reduction figure is 250 billion francs, mainly in civil expenditure and economic investment. As for military expenditure, it was also decided in the plan to reduce 66 billion francs; but this is just empty talk on paper. Finance Minister Pflimlin admitted in November 1957: "The savings on military expenditure decided in July this year have not been realized, because the figure for overspending is almost equal to the figure for savings."

	Taxes had already increased by 260 billion francs in 1956. In 1957, the three cabinets also successively promulgated multiple decrees, increasing taxes by nearly 500 billion francs, bringing the total tax revenue for the year to 3,688.8 billion francs. The tax revenue figures for these two years are equivalent to 76% and 80% of the budgeted fixed expenditure, respectively, and equivalent to 23% and 25% of the total national income.

	What is the result of such various ways of raising money? It is enough to illustrate the problem by citing this fact: in order to cope with the government's expenditure, the Mollet cabinet over-drew 80 billion francs from the Bank of France in May 1957; at the end of June, the Bourgès-Maunoury cabinet borrowed another 300 billion francs from the bank; and by November, the French government was so poor that it could not even pay the salaries of civil servants, so Gaillard had to borrow another 250 billion francs from the bank.

	Deteriorating Foreign Trade, Depleted Reserves

	France's predicament in foreign payments is no better than the state of the national treasury. At the end of 1955, after a long period of hard work, France had US$2 billion (700 billion francs) of gold and foreign exchange reserves on hand. By the end of 1956, foreign exchange reserves had fallen to less than US$500 million. In 1957 alone, not only were foreign exchange reserves wiped out, but also the US$262.2 million drawn from the International Monetary Fund in October 1956, the US$100 million oil loan from a private American bank in February 1957, the US$33 million loan from the US government to France for the purchase of surplus agricultural products such as cotton, and the US$50 million loan from the European Payments Union in June were used up. Gold reserves were originally the lifeline of the Bank of France as currency reserves, and as a result, one-third of the 300 billion francs (US$860 million) of gold in stock was also used. This was not enough, and in December, the French Ministry of Finance was forced to take emergency measures, ordering banks to transfer 30% of the US dollar deposits of their overseas branches to the Bank of France to cope with the crisis of international payments.

	The international payment difficulties are the result of the deterioration of foreign trade; and one of the important reasons for the deterioration of foreign trade is that the Algerian War consumed a large number of industrial products that could have been exported, and it was necessary to import military equipment from abroad. Comparing the figures from several aspects, the problem is very obvious:

			(Unit: Billion Francs)
				1955	1956	1957
	Trade Deficit with Foreign Countries	82	413	492
	Imported Military Materials		——	60	90
	Industial Products Consumed by the Military	300	430	535

	In order to improve the foreign trade situation, the French government took measures to restrict imports in March 1957, and at the same time stipulated new incentive methods for exports. By June, it was decided to restore the import quota system and further strengthen export incentives. However, the results were minimal. Because France's production must rely on imported raw materials. Lemair, the Undersecretary of Industry and Commerce of the Mollet cabinet, calculated an account: if industrial production increases by 10%, imports must increase by 20% to 30%.

	Then, Gaillard made another effort, devaluing the franc by 20% in August and October in two steps. What was announced in August was a "partial devaluation" of the franc—the raw materials accounting for 40% of France's total imports still maintained the original exchange rate, with the aim of strengthening the competitiveness of French export commodities and reducing the pressure of domestic price increases. However, speculative merchants took the opportunity to drill loopholes in the import of raw materials, causing a large outflow of foreign exchange. As a result, this regulation had to be abolished in October, and the franc was fully devalued.

	After that, the trade deficit in October and November did indeed shrink significantly. However, there was no improvement in exports, but imports fell by about 20%, reducing to more than 120 billion francs. This resulted in insufficient raw materials for domestic production and a large consumption of stored materials. Pflimlin had to announce in a television broadcast that the government still had to "import certain materials to eliminate the phenomenon of scarcity." And imports in December immediately jumped to 153.6 billion francs, and the trade deficit also increased.

	Franc Devaluation, Soaring Prices

	The benefits of the franc devaluation have not yet been seen for French finances, but the harms have followed one after another.

	The actual value of the franc has been declining for several years, and there have been rumors of devaluation from time to time. However, successive governments have been unwilling to bear this blame during their terms of office. Gaillard also sang the high-profile tune of "defending the franc" when he first became the Minister of Finance. It was only later that the crisis forced him to make such a decision. The French government originally hoped that the price of the franc in the international money market could stabilize after the devaluation. However, the facts brought them disappointment. Taking the exchange rate with the US dollar as an example, the official price was 350 francs before the devaluation, and the black market price was 420 to 430 francs. After the devaluation, the official price was 420 francs, and the black market price gradually reached 500 to 510 francs.

	The franc devaluation also caused a major price fluctuation in France. Due to the government's excessive issuance of paper money and large tax increases, prices in France have been rising continuously for a long time. After the franc devaluation, prices became like a runaway horse. Taking the wholesale price index compiled by the official, which cannot reflect the actual situation, the total index increased by 11.5% in the five months after August 1957, and food prices increased by 19%.

	"Fight against rising prices!" The French government also pretended to shout this nice slogan. In addition to tightening credit several times, Gaillard also announced at the end of August that he would take measures to "freeze prices." However, this involved the interests of various economic groups in France, thus causing fierce disputes. The French government finally gave way to the bosses, and even took the initiative to order the increase of the prices of 130 kinds of commodities in early December.

	In fact, the real plan of the French government is to "freeze wages." The French government waved the absurd "theory of wage-price spiral," insisting that raising wages is a factor that promotes price increases. What is the fact? According to preliminary calculations, the average nominal wage of workers throughout 1957 increased by only about 9%. While the cost of living rose by 15%. What's more, the burden added to workers by heavy taxes must also be considered.

	Faced with this attack by the government, the French working masses fought back with practical actions. In October 1957 alone, France experienced three large-scale strikes involving millions of people. This is a strong warning: the French working people cannot tolerate the government continuing to implement a fiscal policy that tightens the people's belts.

	Galloping on the Edge of a Cliff, The Future is Bleak

	Just when the situation was desperate, Gaillard suddenly became "optimistic" at the beginning of this year and talked about "fiscal restoration." According to him, the loans that Monnet lobbied for in Washington were enough to balance France's international payment deficit in 1958.

	This confidence is not based on anything. France received foreign emergency loans, claiming to be more than US$655 million, but US$186 million of them were wartime loans that the United States gave up when they expired, and US$88 million were supplies of surplus cotton and military materials; therefore, France could only use more than US$380 million in foreign exchange. And what will be the foreign trade situation in France in 1958? According to Pflimlin, imports from foreign countries will be at least 1.7 trillion francs, about the same as in 1957; exports to foreign countries will strive to reach 1.45 trillion francs, an increase of 2% compared with 1957. Even according to this plan, the trade deficit will reach 250 billion francs (US$600 million); the foreign exchange obtained from borrowing is not enough to cope with it.

	The actual situation will naturally be worse than the French government's subjective wishes. On the export front, Pflimlin has already declared in advance that it is particularly difficult to make progress due to the sluggish international market. And on the import front, since France agreed to the conditions of relaxing trade restrictions when begging for foreign debt, the planned figures will inevitably be broken through. Although France had strict restrictions on imports in 1957, imports from the United States increased by 26% compared with 1956, with a trade deficit of 210 billion francs; it goes without saying what the situation will be this year after the import quota is relaxed.

	On the domestic payment front, the situation in 1958 will also be difficult to improve. The budget for 1958, due to the government's re-implementation of its old trick, drastically increasing taxes and cutting expenditures, the fiscal deficit is 600 billion francs, much lower than in the previous two years. Total tax revenue increased by 535 billion francs compared with 1957, reaching 4,223 billion francs; this growth rate (14.5%) far exceeds the growth rate of national income, killing the chicken to get the eggs, the consequences are obviously serious. Expenditures were cut twice in August and December 1957, totaling 784.2 billion francs, of which 70% were investment, social welfare expenses, and civil expenditures. Military spending still maintains a huge number of 1,325 billion, but the military department has been shouting that this money is not enough. Just like in the previous two years, several supplementary budgets will inevitably be proposed in 1958 to increase military spending; the fiscal deficit will also increase.

	The facts are already very clear that the root cause of France's economic deterioration is the Algerian War and the North Atlantic's arms race and war preparations policy. Even some of the more sober-minded figures within the French ruling group, such as Mendès France, have seen this. If the French government is unwilling to accept the contemptuous title of "The Prodigal Son of Europe," then it should turn back as soon as possible. Unfortunately, until now, France has not only insisted on acting recklessly in Algeria, but has further expanded its aggression in North Africa. On the issue of improving East-West relations, France is also looking at the face of the United States and does not dare to act independently.

	Not long ago, French Finance Minister Pflimlin complained that his job was too difficult. He said: "We are now advancing on a narrow ridge between the two cliffs of inflation and economic recession, and it is not easy to find the rugged path we should take." And the French government wants to gallop on the edge of the cliff, and the future will not be wonderful.

    “欧洲的浪子”还无意回头
    ——关于法国的财政危机——
    袁先禄
    生产“繁荣”财政破产
    “欧洲的浪子”——某些西方报刊用这样一个刺耳的名字来称呼法国。它们的理由是：法国的国内消费太没有节制了，以致在目前“生产繁荣”的期间财政却濒于破产。
    的确，1954年以来，法国工业生产的增长速度在资本主义世界中同西德并驾齐驱，远远超过其它国家。下面是法、英、美、西德工业生产指数的比较：
              （1953＝100）
    年份　      法国　英国　美国　西德
    1954　       110　 107　 93　 112
    1955　       120　 113　 104　129
    1956　       133　 112　 107　139
    1957（预计） 145　 113　 106　147
    至于法国的财政，从1956年开始就陷于严重的危机中。不论国内收支还是国际收支，两年来都是亏空累累，难以弥补。
    这是不是因为法国国内消费增长过度了呢？问题不能笼统回答。法国国家经济审计委员会公布的下列数字，表明了法国国内消费各部分按物资数量计算的增长情况：
            1956年　1957年　两年合计
  私人消费　  5％　 5.5％　 10.8％
  公共消费　 29％　   9％　 40.6％
  固定资本　  8％　   8％　 16.6％
    在国内消费中一马当先地增长的所谓公共消费，按照上述委员会的说明，其中主要是军事费用。法国财政搞得如此焦头烂额的原因何在，这就很清楚了。
    但是，法国政府却企图把责任归诸于法国人民。摩勒、布歇—莫努里和盖伊阿三届内阁，都采取了把人民裤带勒紧再勒紧的财政政策。由于药不对症，财政状况还是每况愈下。因此，盖伊阿内阁今年不得不低声下气地向国外乞求债款，来把日子勉强过下去。
    军费沉重　国库空空
    对于法国财政说来，执行北大西洋政策所带来的军费负担，本来是够沉重的了。自从阿尔及利亚战争爆发，特别是在1956年初扩大以来，法国的军费开支更是激剧增加。于是财政赤字也就不能不随而扩大。
          法国军费和财政赤字情况
            （单位：十亿法郎）
                    1955年　1956年　1957年军费开支　         1，085　 1，125　1，420其中阿尔及利亚战费　   48　    315   　390财政赤字　            714　     99　  5957
    应该说明，上面这些官方公布的数字，是经过大大缩小了的。像在阿尔及利亚的实际战争费用，据法国进步报纸“解放报”的材料，三年来分别为二千七百二十亿、六千一百九十亿和六千七百八十亿法郎。1957年的全部军事开支，估计实际上要接近一万五千亿法郎。
    法国政府是怎样来弥补财政赤字的呢？
    发行钞票是最方便的办法。法国的通货恶性膨胀早已十分严重，但是纸币发行额在1956年还是增加了二千六百一十亿法郎；1957年的增长额，据共和国参议院财政委员会估计，可能为五千五百亿法郎。
    发行公债是另一个主意。摩勒内阁的财政部长拉马第埃在1956年一年内发行了公债四千三百四十亿法郎。不过，公债的年息五厘，对日后的财政是个不轻的负担。而且，1957年3月再发行公债时已经此路不通，推销额只有八百三十亿，大大低于政府的预期。
    于是，法国政府在1957年就主要依靠削减预算和增加税收来应付难关。这总算把财政赤字的实际结果从一万五千亿法郎减少为目前的九千多亿法郎。
    预算削减的数字是二千五百亿法郎，其中主要是民用开支和经济投资。至于军事费用，在计划中也决定要削减六百六十亿法郎；但是这只是纸上空谈。财政部长弗林姆兰在1957年11月份承认：“今年7月份决定的关于军事费用的节约并没有实现，因为超支的数字差不多等于节约的数字。”
    税收在1956年已经增加了二千六百亿法郎。1957年三届内阁又都先后颁布了多次法令，增加了税收近五千亿法郎，使全年税收总额达到三万六千八百八十亿法郎。这两年的税收数字，分别等于预算固定支出的76％和80％，等于国民收入总额的23％和25％。
    这样多方罗掘的结果怎样呢？只消举出这件事实就足以说明问题了：为了应付政府的开支，1957年5月摩勒内阁向法兰西银行透支了八百亿法郎；6月末，布歇—莫努里内阁又向银行贷款三千亿法郎；而到11月法国政府竟又穷得连公务人员的薪水都发不出，以致盖伊阿不得不再一次向银行贷款二千五百亿法郎。
    外贸恶化　储备枯竭
    法国在对外支付中的窘相，比起国库情况来并不稍好些。在1955年末，法国经过长期惨淡经营，手头有着二十亿美元（合七千亿法郎）的黄金外汇储备。到1956年末，外汇储备降为不到五亿美元。在1957年一年中，不但外汇储备已经一扫而光，而且还用完了1956年10月向国际货币基金提取的两亿六千二百万美元，1957年2月美国私人银行一亿美元的石油贷款，美国政府给法国购买棉花等剩余农产品的三千三百万美元贷款和6月欧洲支付同盟五千万美元的贷款。黄金储备原是法兰西银行作为货币准备金的命根子，结果库存黄金三千亿法郎（合八亿六千万美元）也被动用了三分之一。这些还不够，到12月份，法国财政部又被逼得采取紧急措施，下令让各银行把海外分行的美元存款调拨30％存入法兰西银行，来应付国际支付的危机。
    国际支付的困境，是对外贸易恶化的结果；而对外贸易恶化的重要原因之一，是阿尔及利亚战争消耗了大量本来可以出口的工业产品，并且需要从外国进口军事装备。把几方面的数字对比一下，问题就很明显了：
              （单位：十亿法郎）
                     1955年　1956年　1957年同外国贸易逆差　       82　   413　   492进口军事物资        　——　   60　    90军事消耗的工业产品　  300　   430　   535 
    为了改善对外贸易状况，法国政府在1957年3月就采取了限制输入的措施，同时规定了对出口的新的鼓励办法。到6月份，又决定恢复入口限额制度，并且进一步加强了出口鼓励。但是，结果收效极微。因为，法国的生产必须依赖进口的原料。摩勒内阁的工商次长勒梅尔就算过一笔账：工业生产增加10％，输入就必须增加20％到30％。
    接着，盖伊阿又作了一番努力，在8月和10月用分两步走的办法把法郎贬值20％。在8月份宣布的是法郎“部分贬值”——占法国进口总额40％的原料仍旧维持原来的外汇比价，目的是为了加强法国出口商品的竞争能力和减轻国内物价上涨的压力。但是，投机商人却乘机在进口原料方面大钻空子，使得外汇大量外流。于是，10月份不得不废除这项规定，而使法郎全面贬值了。
    在这以后，10月和11月的贸易逆差果然显著地缩小了。不过，出口并无起色，只是进口下降了20％左右，减少到一千二百多亿法郎。这使国内生产原料不足，贮存物资大量消耗。弗林姆兰在一次电视广播谈话中不得不宣布，政府还是要“输入某些物资来消除匮乏现象”。而12月的进口马上又一跃而为一千五百三十六亿法郎，贸易逆差也提高了。
    法郎贬值　物价飞腾
    法郎贬值对法国财政的利尚未见，害却接踵而至了。
    几年来法郎的实际价值一直在下降，贬值之风时有所闻。但是，历届政府都不愿意在任期内背起这口黑锅。盖伊阿在刚当财政部长的时候，也曾唱过“保卫法郎”的高调。只是后来危机逼人，才不得不狠心作出这样的决定。法国政府原来希望，法郎贬值以后在国际货币市场上的价格能够稳定下来。但是，事实给他们带来的却是失望。拿美元比值来说，贬值前按官价是三百五十法郎，黑市价是四百二十到四百三十法郎。贬值后按官价是四百二十法郎，而黑市价格竟逐步达到五百到五百一十法郎。
    法郎贬值，在法国国内还引起了一场物价的大波动。由于政府滥发纸币和大增税收，法国的物价长期来就在不断上涨。法郎贬值以后，物价更变得像脱缰的野马一样。就拿官方编制的远不能反映实际情况的批发物价指数来看，1957年8月以后的五个月中，总指数就提高了11.5％，而食品价格竟提高了19％。
    “同物价上涨作斗争！”法国政府装腔作势地也喊着这个动听的口号。除了几次紧缩信贷以外，盖伊阿在8月末还宣布要采取“冻结物价”的措施。但是，这牵涉到法国各种经济集团的利益，因而引起了激烈的争吵。法国政府最后当然是向老板们让步，甚至到12月初主动下令提高一百三十种商品的价格。
    实际上，法国政府的真正打算是要“冻结工资”。法国政府挥舞着“工资物价螺旋上升”的荒谬“理论”，硬说提高工资是促使物价上涨的因素。事实怎样呢？据初步计算，1957年全年工人的名义工资平均不过增加9％左右。而生活费用上涨了15％。何况，还必须考虑沉重的捐税给工人所增加的负担。
    面对着政府的这种进攻，法国的工人群众用实际行动来进行回击。仅1957年10月份，法国连续发生了三次有数百万人参加的大罢工。这是一个有力的警告：法国劳动人民不能容忍政府再执行勒紧人民裤带的财政政策了。
    悬崖纵马　前途不妙
    就在这种山穷水尽的时候，今年年初盖伊阿突然“乐观”得谈起“财政复原”来了。据他说，莫内在华盛顿活动到的贷款，已经足以平衡1958年法国国际支付的赤字。
    这种信心是丝毫没有根据的。法国得到的国外紧急贷款，号称六亿五千五百多万美元，但是，其中有一亿八千六百万是美国放弃的到期的战时贷款，还有八千八百万是剩余棉花和军事物资的供应；因此，法国可以动用的外汇只有三亿八千多万美元。而法国1958年的对外贸易情况将会怎样呢？据弗林姆兰宣布：从外
  国的进口至少为一万七千亿法郎，同1957年差不多；向外国的出口争取达到一万四千五百亿法郎，比1957年增加2％。即使按这个计划计算，逆差也要达到二千五百亿法郎（合六亿美元）；借贷所得的外汇，已不够应付。
    实际情况自然会比法国政府的主观愿望更糟。在出口方面，弗林姆兰已经预先声明：由于国际市场不景气，要取得进展是特别困难的。而在进口方面，由于法国乞求外债时同意了放宽贸易限制的条件，计划数字就必然会被突破。1957年虽然法国对进口有着严格的限制，但是从美国的进口却比1956年增加了26％，逆差达二千一百亿法郎；今年进口限额放宽后情况将会怎样，是不言自明的。
    在国内支付方面，1958年的情况也很难有所改善。1958年的预算，由于政府重施故技，大刀阔斧地增加赋税和削减开支，财政赤字是六千亿法郎，比前两年低得多。税收总额比1957年增加了五千三百五十亿法郎，达到四万二千二百三十亿法郎；这种增长速度（14.5％）大大超过国民收入的增长速度，杀鸡取卵，后果显然是严重的。开支在1957年8月和12月先后两次削减了七千八百四十二亿法郎，其中70％是投资、社会福利费用和民用开支。军事费用仍然保持一万三千二百五十亿的巨数，但是军事部门已经大嚷这些钱不够花。正像前两年一样，在1958年也必然会提出几次补充预算来增加军费；财政赤字也就要加大。
    事实已经很明显，法国经济恶化的病根是阿尔及利亚战争和北大西洋的扩军备战政策。连法国统治集团内不少比较清醒的人物，像孟戴斯—弗朗斯等，也都看到了这一点。法国政府如果不愿意接受“欧洲的浪子”这种轻蔑的称呼，那末就应该及早回头。很可惜，直到现在，法国不但坚持在阿尔及利亚蛮干下去，且进一步扩大了在北非的侵略。对于改善东西方关系的问题，法国也是看着美国的脸色办事，不敢独立行事。
    不久前，法国财政部长弗林姆兰曾经抱怨他这个差使太不好干。他说：“我们现在是在通货膨胀和经济衰退这两个悬崖之间的狭窄山脊上前进，不容易找到我们所应走的崎岖小道。”而法国政府悬崖还要纵马，前途是不会美妙的。
