This newspaper provides a comprehensive report: In response to the resolution of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to hold a "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" on March 30, people in many countries have recently launched movements to support the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

The "Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with Algeria's Struggle for Independence" was recently established in Hanoi. On the evening of the 26th, the committee issued a letter to the people of the whole country, calling on the Vietnamese people to enthusiastically participate in the activities of the "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" to be held on the 30th of this month.

The Secretary-General of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions issued a statement on the second anniversary of the Confederation's founding, calling on workers all over the world to hold gatherings to publicize the Algerian people's struggle, expose the atrocities of imperialism, and donate one hour's wage to the Algerian people. The Egyptian Committee for Algerian Freedom has begun a large-scale propaganda and donation campaign to support the Algerian people's struggle against French imperialism and for national independence.

According to plans, at noon on March 30, a five-minute silence will be observed throughout Egypt to mourn the Algerian martyrs, and gatherings will be held in schools, churches, and mosques. Artists will hold demonstrations protesting French atrocities, and their works condemning the French colonial war will also be exhibited at the Cairo Railway Station.

A national conference demanding a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question will be held in Paris on March 30. In preparation for this conference, people across France have held various gatherings of all sizes and carried out various activities. These gatherings and activities show that the appeal for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question issued by one hundred and ten prominent French figures in early February has received a wide and enthusiastic response from people of all strata.
