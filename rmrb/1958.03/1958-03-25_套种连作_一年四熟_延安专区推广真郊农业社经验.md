Intercropping and Continuous Cropping, Four Harvests a Year
Yan'an Prefecture Promotes the Experience of Zhenjiao Agricultural Cooperative

Xi'an, March 22nd (By our reporter) According to the Shaanxi Daily, seven agricultural cooperatives in Ansai County, Yan'an Prefecture, have promoted intercropping and continuous cropping methods, achieving four harvests a year and exceeding the Yangtze River in production, creating a rich harvest experience for the hilly and gully areas of northern Shaanxi.

The intercropping and continuous cropping method was successfully tested by Gao Mingcheng, a technician from the Zhenjiao Agricultural Cooperative in Ansai County. Around the Qingming Festival each year, he plants spring barley, spring wheat, or spring peas. Around the Grain in Ear period, he intercrops millet or foxtail millet between the rows of these crops. When the millet and foxtail millet grow to three or four inches, it is the harvest season for spring barley and spring wheat. He digs up the stubble of spring barley and spring wheat, which is equivalent to cultivating and loosening the soil for the millet and foxtail millet. At the same time, he manually thins the millet and foxtail millet, so that the millet and foxtail millet not only have sufficient sunlight but can also fully absorb the nutrients of the soil. During the middle of the hot season, he intercrops turnips between the rows of millet and foxtail millet, and plants pumpkins and castor beans along the edges of the field. In order to restore soil fertility in a timely manner, he also invented the method of fertilizing with rotten firewood, providing the crops with the necessary fertilizers to ensure that each crop grows well. Since Gao Mingcheng began experimenting in 1953, he has achieved bumper harvests year after year. In 1955 and 1956, the yield per mu reached 800 to 977 jin, nine times higher than the local yield. After this method was promoted in the nearby seven agricultural cooperatives, they also achieved high yields, and one cooperative even exceeded Gao Mingcheng's yield per mu.

Now, Yan'an Prefecture Commissioner Yang Cunfu and others are summarizing the experience of the intercropping and continuous cropping method in the Zhenjiao Agricultural Cooperative and have decided to promote it throughout the prefecture starting from this year's spring sowing, transforming northern Shaanxi from one crop a year to two to four crops a year.

    套种连作　一年四熟
    延安专区推广真郊农业社经验
    本报西安22日电　据陕西日报消息：延安专区安塞县七个农业社推广套种连作耕作法，达到一年四熟，产量跨过长江，为陕北丘陵沟壑地区创造了丰产经验。
    套种连作耕作法是安塞县真郊农业社技术员高明成试验成功的。他在每年清明前后种上春大麦、春小麦或春豌豆等作物；到芒种前后，在这些作物的行间，套种上糜子或谷子。当糜、谷长到三、四寸时，正是春大麦、春小麦的收割期，他把春大麦、春小麦的茬挖掉，等于给糜、谷中耕松土；同时用手给糜、谷间苗，使糜、谷不光有充分的阳光，也能充分吸收土地的养分。到中伏时，又在糜、谷行间，套种上蔓菁，地边种上南瓜、蓖麻子。为了及时恢复地力，他还发明了烂柴草熏肥法，供给农作物所需要的肥料，保证每项作物都长的很好。高明成从1953年试验以来，连年丰产，1955年和1956年，亩产达八百斤到九百七十七斤，高出当地产量九倍。这个方法在附近的七个农业社推广以后，也达到了高额丰产，其中有一个社，还超过了高明成的每亩产量。
    现在延安专区杨存富专员等正在真郊农业社总结套种连作耕作法的经验，决定从今年春播开始在全专区推广，变陕北一年一熟为一年两熟到四熟。
