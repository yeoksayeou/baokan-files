	New folk songs cross ridge after ridge, every ridge is a stretch of green. It's not that spring has come early this year, but that new forests are planted on every mountain.
		(Yi Huang, Jiangxi) Grit your teeth, fight hard for three years, turn saline-alkali land into rice paddies, turn sandy land into orchards, and turn Henan into Jiangnan.

    新山歌走了一岭又一岭，岭岭尽是一片青，不是今年春到早，山山种起新绿林。
          （江西宜黄）咬紧牙关，苦战三年，把盐碱地变稻田，把沙地变果园，把河南变成江南。
          （河南开封）
