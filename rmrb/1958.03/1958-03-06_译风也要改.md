Writers are responding to the Party's call to also make a Great Leap Forward, to create more and better literary works to meet the needs of the broad masses. If works are to win the love of the masses, they must improve their language. In this way, the issue of writing style becomes prominent. Comrade Lao She, in his speech at this National People's Congress, shouted the slogan of overthrowing foreign officialese. Following that, "Wenyi Bao" held a symposium on liberating writing style, and writers unanimously agreed in their speeches to get rid of bureaucratic jargon. However, until now, we have not heard the voices of translators, and we don't know what their thoughts are on this issue. Translators cannot escape responsibility in this matter. Firstly, various translated texts come into contact with a large number of readers, and awkward, incomprehensible translations are not conducive to the dissemination of culture. Secondly, there are reflections that some of the textual problems in literary creations, academic papers, and non-literary articles are related to translation and are influenced by bad translations. Young people read translations that are seemingly understandable but actually confusing, awkward, and dragging, and they imitate them, thinking that only by writing in this way can they appear erudite.

Our translations do have good ones, and many have been carefully considered and revised. Some are even literature in themselves. But it cannot be denied that some translations are not good. Extremely difficult sentences, unnecessary foreign tones, unreasonable mixing of classical and vernacular Chinese, and even literal and forced translations have long been dissatisfactory to readers.

For example, I recently saw a translation like this: The revisionists "drove the essence of revolution out of Marxism." The meaning of this sentence is simply that the revisionists castrated or extracted the revolutionary essence of Marxism. However, the translator insisted on creating the strange language of "drove... out of" something. As for writing "have not yet" as "still have not," it cannot be said to be a rare phenomenon.

In another translation, even the commonly used "regard as" or "consider as" is written as "view as." The translation is like this: "Readers view them (referring to some writers) as part of the literary mainstream, as models for people to imitate." Why insist on writing the vernacular "kan 看" (see, look, regard) as the classical Chinese "shi 视" (view, regard)? Moreover, "shizuo 视作" (view as) cannot even be found in classical Chinese. Is this classical Chinese or vernacular Chinese, what country's language is it?

Another example: "If there were no Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the bourgeoisie's offensive against the working class in capitalist countries would undoubtedly be more severe, and the proletariat's resistance would not be as strong as it is with the existence of the world socialist camp."

Here, let's not discuss whether the term "world socialist camp" can be translated better, but let's examine the usage of "have... existence." Is it that because we have read books for a few years, we can no longer say "I have a pair of hands" and must say "I have a pair of hands existing"?

As one of the readers, I would like to imitate and make a request to some translation workers in this way: "If such awkward sentences exist in your translations, I suggest you drive them out of the translations and not view them as the mainstream of your translations, as models for people to imitate."

Writing style must be changed, and translation style is a part of writing style, so it must also be changed!

    译风也要改
    傅达
    作家们响应党的号召也要大跃进，要创作更多更好的文艺作品来满足广大群众的需要。作品要赢得群众的喜爱，就不能不改进一下语言。这样，文风问题就显得突出了。老舍同志在这次人民代表大会上发言，喊出了打倒洋八股的口号。接着“文艺报”开了解放文风的座谈会，作家们发言一致赞成要革掉八股腔。可是到现在为止，还没有听到翻译家们的声音，不知道他们对这个问题有些什么感想。翻译工作者在这件事上是脱不了干系的。因为一则，各种翻译文字接触着大量读者，别扭的、不通的译文不利于文化的传布；二则，有这样的反映：文艺创作、论文和非文艺性质的文章中的一部分文字上的毛病，追究起原因来，和翻译有关系，是受了坏的译文的影响。青年们读了似通非通、别别扭扭、拖拖沓沓的译文，就学起样来，以为只有这样写，才显得学问高深。
    我们的译文是有好的，不少是经过推敲修饰的。有些甚至本身也是文学。但是不能否认，有一些译文是不好的。异常费解的句字，不必要的洋腔洋调，没有理由的文白羼杂，以至生造、硬译，早已为读者所不满了。
    例如最近看到有这样的译文：修正主义者“把革命的本质由马克思主义里驱将出来”。这句话的意思无非是说修正主义者阉割了或者抽掉了马克思主义的革命实质。可是，译者却硬要创造“由”什么“驱将出来”这样古怪的语言。至于把“还没有”写成“尚没有”，更不能说是少见的现象。
    在另一篇译文中，甚至把通常用的“看做”或“看作”写成“视作”。译文是这样的：“读者是把他们（指某些作家）视作文学主流的一部分，视作供人模仿的榜样的”。为什么硬要把白话的“看”写成文言的“视”呢？而且“视作”在文言文里也是找不到的。这究竟是文言还是白话，是哪一国的语言呢？
    又如这样的例子：“如果没有苏联和其他社会主义国家，资产阶级对资本主义国家工人阶级的进攻毫无疑问会更厉害一些，而无产阶级的反抗力量也不会像有世界社会主义国家阵营存在那样。”
    这里且不谈“世界社会主义国家阵营”这样名词是不是可以译得更好些，我们要研究一下“有……存在”这个用法。难道因为我们读了几年书，就再也不能说“我有一双手”这样的话，而非要说“我有一双手存在”了吗？
    作为读者之一，我想模仿一下，用这样的话来向有些译翻工作者提出一个要求：“如果有这样的别扭字句存在于你的译文中，我建议你把它们由译文里面驱将出来，而不视作你的译文的主流，视作供人模仿的榜样。”
    文风要改，译风是文风的一部分，也要改！
