    Let New Things Participate in Competitions
    When any new thing is first born, it is generally recognized by only a few people, and it takes some time before it is acknowledged by the majority. How can a new thing be recognized by society more quickly? The best way is to let it participate in practical life and participate in competitions. "You don't have to worry about not recognizing good merchandise; the only thing you have to worry about is not having the chance to compare it with other merchandise." Through competition, everyone can clearly see who is superior and who is inferior, who is advanced and who is backward.
    The reason why the double-wheeled double-铧 plow has been recognized and welcomed is that it has gained the upper hand in production and in competition with the old plows. However, this is not an easy task. In the past, didn't some people rudely deprive the double-铧 plow of its right to compete in production? They indiscriminately relegated the double-wheeled double-铧 plow to the cold palace, not allowing it to participate in production, but only allowing it to slowly rust there, and become crippled from rusting. On the other hand, they easily labeled it with the hats of "sleeping plow," "idle plow," and "dead plow," which was such a great injustice! Fortunately, with the care and support of the Party and advanced producers, the double-wheeled double-铧 plow was able to break through all kinds of slanders and obstacles, participate in production competitions in many places, exert its power, and achieve a universally recognized victory. Now, aren't people restoring its reputation?
    In order to learn how to correctly treat new things, we should not forget the past experiences of the double-wheeled double-铧 plow and the lessons learned from it.

### 让新事物参加比赛

    让新事物参加比赛
    任何新事物刚刚出世的时候，一般总是先被少数人所认识，经过一个时候才被多数人所承认。怎样才能使一个新事物更快地获得社会的公认呢？最好的办法是让它参加实际生活，参加比赛。“不怕不识货，就怕货比货。”经过比赛，谁高谁低，谁优谁劣，谁进步谁落后，大家可以看得清清楚楚。
    双轮双铧犁之所以得到承认和欢迎，就是因为它在生产上、在同旧犁的比赛中占了上风。但是，这也不是一件容易事。过去一个时期，不是偏偏有些人粗暴地剥夺了双铧犁在生产上的比赛权吗？他们不由分说地把双轮双铧犁打入了冷宫，不让它参加生产，只让它在那里慢慢生锈，由生锈而残废。另方面却又轻易地给它带上了“睡犁”“闲犁”、“死犁”的帽子，这是多么大的冤枉！幸亏有党和先进生产者的爱护和支持，双轮双铧犁得以冲破种种污蔑和障碍，在许多地方参加了生产比赛，施展了它的威力，并且得到了公认的胜利。现在，人们不是又在为它恢复名誉了吗？
    为了学会正确地对待新事物，我们今后不该忘记双轮双铧犁的前前后后的遭遇和这里面的教训。
