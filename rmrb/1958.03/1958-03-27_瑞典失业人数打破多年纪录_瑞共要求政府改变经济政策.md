Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, March 25th: According to TASS, "Ny Dag" published the resolution of the Central Committee of the Swedish Communist Party on the issue of the domestic economic situation, passed based on the report by the Party Chairman, Hagberg.

    The resolution stated that workers in all capitalist countries are once again threatened by a widespread economic crisis. The current number of unemployed in Sweden has broken a multi-year record. The most severely affected by unemployment are young people, women, and older workers. News of layoffs is coming daily from enterprises that are reducing production. Capitalists are abusing their unlimited right to unilaterally decide whether enterprises continue operating. Whether or not one can keep their job has become a major issue for millions of working-class families in Sweden.

    The resolution demands that the government change its economic policy and turn its promise of ensuring full employment into reality.

    瑞典失业人数打破多年纪录
    瑞共要求政府改变经济政策
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩25日讯：“新日报”发表了瑞典共产党中央委员会就党的主席哈格堡的报告通过的关于国内经济状况问题的决议。
    决议中说，所有资本主义国家的工人再一次遭到广泛的经济危机的威胁。目前瑞典失业人数已打破多年的纪录。失业情况最严重的是青年、妇女和上年纪的工人。每天都有解雇工人的消息从缩减生产的企业中传来。资本家正在滥用单独解决企业是否继续开工问题的无限权利。能否保住自己的工作已经成为瑞典千千万万工人家庭的重大问题。
    决议中要求政府改变经济政策，把它保证全部就业的诺言变成事实。
