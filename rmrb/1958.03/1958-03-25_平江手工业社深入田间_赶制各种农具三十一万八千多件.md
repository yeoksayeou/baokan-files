    Pingjiang Handicraft Cooperatives Go Deep into the Fields to Rush-Produce More Than 318,000 Pieces of Various Farm Tools
    (Our Dispatch from Changsha, March 24) As Hunan Province enters the busy season of spring plowing, more than 3,500 members of the twenty-seven iron, wood, and bamboo handicraft cooperatives (groups) in Pingjiang County have changed their old service attitude and gone deep into the fields to renovate and repair farm tools for agricultural cooperatives, achieving "points in every township, groups in every cooperative." To date, they have rush-produced more than 318,000 pieces of various iron, wood, and bamboo farm tools for the agricultural cooperatives.
    This year, Pingjiang County will deep-plow and densely plant all paddy fields, and some old farm tools are not suitable for production needs. The county only has 1,850 carpenters. If all farm tools were to be replaced, it would take eighteen and a half days just to make paddy plows alone. Not only would there be no time, but even the wood for making plow beams would not be found. In order to support spring plowing production, all handicraft cooperatives mobilized everyone to actively find ways to solve difficulties. Wang Liansheng, deputy director of the Chengguan Town Wood Lacquer Cooperative, and others studied how to modify old plows. After successful trials and promotion, they saved more than 127,000 yuan and 520 cubic meters of timber for the agricultural cooperatives in the county. Coupled with the 8,000 new-style plows made, the county has basically achieved new-style walking plow mechanization. Other cultivation implements and row markers are also modified from old ones without adding any materials.
    Many handicraft cooperatives have also broken the old habits of requiring farmers to pick up and deliver loads, and "three meals and four smokes," and established a new service attitude. The members of the Changshou Ironware Cooperative carried thirty-four furnaces up the mountains with their own pots, stoves, and luggage, delivering goods to the door in the area of eight townships. In the case of insufficient raw materials, many handicraft cooperatives tried every possible means to use substitutes. In order to ensure quality, all handicraft cooperatives generally implemented a system of "guaranteed use, guaranteed replacement, and guaranteed repair." Most cooperatives have established technical groups to regularly study product quality. (Luo Houren)

    平江手工业社深入田间
    赶制各种农具三十一万八千多件
    本报长沙24日电　湖南省正进入春耕大忙季节，平江县全县二十七个铁、木、篾手工业社（组）的三千五百多名社员，改变旧的服务态度，深入田间为农业社改造和修配农具，做到了“乡乡有点、社社有组”。到目前止，已为各农业社赶制了各种铁、木、篾制农具三十一万八千多件。
    平江县今年全部稻田要深耕密植，部分旧农具不适合生产需要。全县只有一千八百五十个木匠，如果全部农具舍旧换新，单制水田犁一项就要十八天半，不但时间来不及，连做犬辕的木料也找不到。各手工业社为了支援春耕生产，发动大家积极设法解决困难。城关镇木漆社副主任王连生等研究改装旧犁，经试验成功推广后，共为全县农业社节约资金十二万七千余元，木材五百二十立方公尺。加上新做的八千部新式犁，基本上实现了全县新式步犁化。其他中耕器、划行器也是用旧的改造，不添任何材料。
    许多手工业社还打破了过去要农民接送担子、“三饭四烟”等旧习惯，树立了新的服务态度。长寿铁业社的社员们自带锅灶行李，挑着三十四座烘炉上山，在八个乡的地区内翻山越岭，送货上门。在原材料不足的情况下，许多手工业社千方百计地采用代用品。为了保证质量，各手工业社普遍推行“包用、包换、包修”的制度，大部分社都成立了技术小组，经常研究产品质量。　（罗厚仁）
