    Ballad of Carrying Soil (and Another Poem)
    Li Ying
    Carrying soil, carrying soil,
    Carrying soil, carrying soil, a load of soil dedicated to the dam foundation, a load of soil dedicated to the motherland;
    Don't look down on our small baskets,
    One side is the mountain, the other side is the river. Soaking the earth in sweat, we will harvest: wheat again, apples again!
    Carrying soil, carrying soil,
    Carrying soil, carrying soil, a load of soil dedicated to the golden-winged carp, a load of soil dedicated to tomorrow night's lights;
    Don't look down on our small baskets,
    A basket of soil, a lock; chain up that horse, that unruly horse, it has been galloping for so long, lasso it, don't let it escape!
    Carrying soil, carrying soil,
    Carrying soil, carrying soil, a load of soil dedicated to the descendants of a hundred generations, a load of soil dedicated to parents and wives;
    Don't look down on our small baskets,
    A basket of soil, a basket of songs. Where is "poverty," where is "weeping," chase it, drive it away, we will bury every tear!
  A Little Tune for the Wenyu River
    You have flowed for a hundred generations, a thousand years, suddenly flowing into today;
    The mountain wants a mirror, the cloud wants a goblet.
    Our ten thousand acres of wheat need a bottle of sufficient milk;
    Our happy little birds need a forest as a cradle.
    Since you love us, Wenyu River, you will love our—wheat, little birds, white clouds, high mountains.
    And we also love you, we will send you a sharp sword, now we forge it, cast it, with fresh red blood, salty sweat.
    We do not know your source, Wenyu River, but we know your today, your today is happy, the happy river will flow forever!

    挑土谣（外一首）
    李瑛
    挑土，挑土，
    挑土，挑土，一挑土献给坝基，一挑土献给祖国；
    别看我们的筐子小，
    一边是山，一边是河。把大地浸在汗里，我们便会收获：又是小麦，又是苹果！
    挑土，挑土，
    挑土，挑土，一挑土献给金翅大鲤鱼，一挑土献给明晚的灯火；
    别看我们的筐子小，
    一筐土，一把锁；索住那匹马，那劣性的马，它已经驰骋了多久，套上它，别逃脱！
    挑土，挑土，
    挑土，挑土，一挑土献给百代的子孙，一挑土献给爹妈和老婆；
    别看我们的筐子小，
    一筐土，一筐歌。“穷困”在哪里，“哭泣”在哪里，把它追着，把它赶着，我们要埋掉你眼泪颗颗！
  寄温榆河小曲你流了百代千年，忽然流进今天；山要一面镜子，云要一只杯盏。我们的万顷小麦，要一瓶足够的奶汁；我们的快乐的小鸟，要一片树林作摇篮。既然你爱我们，温榆河，你就会爱我们的——小麦、小鸟，白云、高山。而我们也是爱你的，我们就送你一把利剑，现在我们锻呀、铸呀，用鲜红的血、咸涩的汗。我们不知道你的源头，温榆河，但知道你的今天，你的今天是幸福的，幸福的河会流到永远！
