    Forty-Two International Hotels
    In Shanghai, during the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, many units, in the spirit of diligence and thrift, have already vacated more than 100,000 square meters of office space; coupled with units that are currently streamlining their organizations, the city is expected to adjust and vacate approximately 840,000 square meters of building area in the first half of the year. This area is equivalent to forty-two Shanghai "International Hotels."
    Last year, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China already handed over more than 10,000 square meters of office space, and this year it has handed over another more than 10,000 square meters. The Transportation Management Bureau, after merging and relocating, can also hand over a large building.
    In terms of factories and warehouses, many units have also reported surplus housing.

    四十二座国际饭店
    上海市在反浪费反保守运动中，许多单位本着勤俭节约的精神，已经腾出十多万平方公尺的办公房屋；加上正在紧缩机构的单位，上半年全市将可调整腾出约八十四万平方公尺的建筑面积。这个面积相等于四十二座上海“国际饭店”。
    人民银行上海分行去年已经交出了一万多平方公尺的办公房屋，今年又上交了一万多平方公尺。交通运输管理局经过迁并以后，也可上交一幢大楼。
    在工厂和仓库方面，不少单位也把多余房屋上报。
