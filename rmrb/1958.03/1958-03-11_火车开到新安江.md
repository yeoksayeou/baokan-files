The Lanxi-Tongguan railway branch line, mainly for transporting materials for the Xin'an River Hydropower Station construction project, officially opened to traffic on the 8th and started passenger and freight transportation.

The entire length from Lanxi to Xin'an River Station is 47.2 kilometers. This railway branch line was built by the Railway Corps who constructed the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. It only took a little over ten months from surveying and design to completion.

    火车开到新安江
    主要为新安江水电站建设工程运输物资的兰（溪）铜（官）铁路支线，8日正式通车，并且开办了客货运输。
    从兰溪到新安江车站全长四十七点二公里。这条铁路支线是由修建鹰厦线的铁道兵负责兴建的。从勘测设计施工到建成，只花了十个月多一点的时间。
