    Artificial Pearl Cultivation
    Hepu County, Guangdong Province, China's famous pearl producing area, has begun to establish a pearl farming experimental farm in Bailong Pearl Pond, where the best pearls are produced, to cultivate pearls artificially using scientific methods. This is the first time in China.
    The artificial cultivation method is as follows: first, select older pearl oysters as cultured pearl mothers. Through surgery, place pre-made pearl nuclei (small round particles made of shells) into the appropriate part of the pearl mother's body, and then place it in a cage and put it into the sea for cultivation. The pearl oyster is constantly stimulated by the pearl nucleus, and continuously secretes pearl liquid to coat the nucleus.
    The Hepu pearl production area is vast, reaching over 500 li, and the pearl source is very rich. One person can obtain one or two pearls per dive. Pearl oysters are laden with pearls, with some containing more than seventy. Hepu pearls are round, lustrous, and crystalline, and have a high reputation internationally.

    人工养珍珠
    我国著名珍珠产地——广东合浦县，开始在珠产最优的白龙珠池建立珍珠养殖试验场，由人工用科学方法养殖珍珠。这在我国还是第一次。
    人工养殖办法是：先选择较老的珍珠贝作为养殖珠母，通过手术将预制的珍珠核（用贝壳制成的小圆粒）置入珠母体内的恰当部位，然后把它置入笼中放进海里养殖。珍珠贝受到珠核的经常刺激，便不断分泌出珍珠液涂在核上。
    合浦珍珠产地宽广达五百多里，珠源非常丰富。一人潜下水底一次可获取一两个。珍珠贝结珠累累，多的一只结七十多粒。合浦珍珠圆、润晶莹，在国际上声誉很高。
