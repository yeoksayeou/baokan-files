Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The first representatives' conference of art units directly under the Ministry of Culture, which concluded today, unanimously adopted a resolution: determined to be political revolutionaries and artistic innovators, ensuring a leading and exemplary role, uniting all employees to complete or exceed the overall leap forward targets, while maintaining quality and quantity.

The more than three hundred representatives attending the conference also put forward the following nine guarantees in the resolution: adhere to the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers, dedicating one-third of the year to performing in factories, rural areas, and military units; mobilize all professional and amateur creative forces to promote creation; implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new"; fulfill the demonstration and experimental tasks of central art units; strengthen research on national art, paying attention to timely summarization of artistic creation experiences, developing towards "one specialty with multiple capabilities"; establish a socialist cooperation system on the basis of division of labor and cooperation; strengthen guidance for mass amateur art activities, providing guidance wherever touring performances go; strive for self-sufficiency in units that can achieve it, and strive to reduce state subsidies for units that cannot; be diligent in learning and practice, respect teachers and love students; strengthen political and cultural learning, regularly participate in labor training, eliminate the "five airs," overcome individualism, and quickly become both red and expert.

At the beginning of the conference, the art units directly under the Ministry of Culture proposed to perform 8,057 shows this year. By the end of the conference, the target had increased to more than 10,500 shows. At the beginning of the conference, it was estimated that the state would still have to subsidize more than 480,000 yuan this year. By the end of the conference, due to the increase in the number of units striving for self-sufficiency, and some units even having surpluses to hand over, state subsidies could be completely eliminated.

The conference also adopted a resolution based on Qian Junrui's suggestion: each representative should post at least four big-character posters to criticize the shortcomings and errors of the leaders of the Ministry of Culture. In the past few days, the representatives have implemented this resolution, posting thousands of big-character posters inside and outside the venue, more deeply exposing the bureaucratism and conservative thinking in the leadership work of the Ministry of Culture.

    文化部直属艺术单位决心作革新派
    演戏一万多场　不要国家补贴
    新华社12日讯　今天结束的文化部直属艺术单位第一届代表会议一致作出决议：决心作政治上的革命派和艺术上的革新派，保证起带头和模范作用，团结全体职工一起完成或超过总的跃进指标，并且保质保量。
    出席会议的三百多个代表在决议中还提出了以下九点保证：坚持工农兵方向，每年有三分之一的时间深入工厂、农村、部队演出；发动所有专业和业余的创作力量繁荣创作；贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针；完成中央艺术单位的示范和实验任务；加强对民族艺术的研究工作，注意及时总结艺术创造经验，向“一专多能”的方向发展；在分工合作的基础上建立社会主义的协作制度；加强对群众业余艺术活动的辅导工作，巡回演出到哪里就辅导到哪里；做到自给的单位争取多上缴，不能自给的单位争取少要国家补贴；做到勤学苦练、尊师爱徒；加强政治文化学习，经常参加劳动锻炼，打掉五气，克服个人主义，迅速达到又红又专。
    会议开始时文化部各直属艺术单位提出今年计划演出八千零五十七场，会议结束时，指标增加到一万零五百多场。会议开始预计国家今年还要补贴四十八万多元，会议结束时，由于争取自给的单位增多，有些单位还有盈余上缴，因此国家补贴可以全部取销。
    会议还根据钱俊瑞的建议通过了一项决议：每个代表至少贴四张以上大字报来批评文化部领导人的缺点错误。几天以来，代表们执行了这个决议，会场内外贴出几千张大字报，更深入地揭露出文化部领导工作中的官僚主义和保守思想。
