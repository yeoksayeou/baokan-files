Nine Fingers and One Finger
Li Qi

Now, the people of the whole country are surging forward! It is truly united in purpose, changing in an instant, with miracles appearing one after another. But in this revolutionary great leap forward situation, there are also some "anxious and worried" people who worry about whether there will be "trouble," mistakes, or shortcomings. This raises the question of how to treat errors and shortcomings in our work.

We are doing unprecedented and novel things. We have already done, and will continue to do, even greater things that have never been done before. In such an endeavor, some shortcomings are unavoidable. However, as long as our work does not have fundamental errors in its line, achievements are always the main thing. The relationship between achievements and shortcomings is like nine fingers and one finger. Right-wing elements have made a big deal out of this issue, adopting the tactic of "attacking one point, exaggerating it as much as possible, ignoring the rest" to launch a major offensive against the Party and the people. And some comrades, like those "anxious and worried" people, often fail to distinguish between the overall situation and the small situation, the general and the individual, the mainstream and the side streams, and fail to distinguish the relationship between nine fingers and one finger. They often regard or exaggerate the shortcomings and errors of one finger as the shortcomings and errors of nine or even ten fingers, blinded by a single leaf, unable to see Mount Tai; thus losing confidence in progress, or even losing their way. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly distinguish the relationship between achievements and shortcomings.

This issue is a matter of ideology and also a very important issue in the art of leadership. If this issue is resolved well, it will boost the confidence of cadres and the masses, inspire their enthusiasm, and promote the great leap forward in work; if it is not resolved well, it will demoralize cadres and the masses and lose their confidence. Therefore, correcting errors and shortcomings in work must be done with the right attitude.

There can be two different attitudes toward errors and shortcomings. One is to proceed from a comprehensive perspective, realistically assess achievements and errors, distinguish the nature and magnitude of errors, find the root causes of their occurrence, and then propose correct solutions to overcome them. This is the Marxist attitude. Experience has shown that all those who have adopted this attitude to deal with errors and shortcomings have done things well, united cadres and the masses, raised everyone's awareness and confidence, overcome errors, and achieved a great leap forward in their work. There are many such examples, and I will cite the work of Macheng to illustrate.

As everyone knows, Macheng is a famous advanced county in Hubei, and it is also one of the advanced banners in the country today. According to comrades who have visited, Macheng's work is indeed well done, not only in agricultural production, but also in many other areas. But Macheng was not like this two years ago. At that time, Macheng, like some other places in the country, had great achievements in its work, but also serious errors and shortcomings. For example, the production plan for 1956 was devised by several county committee comrades sitting in the office thinking it up item by item. Many parts were not in line with reality, and in the process of implementation, the township and commune cadres' level was limited so they could not adapt to local conditions. As a result, a serious style of subjectivism and coercion occurred quite commonly at that time. They have a story: Comrade An Jianguo, the armed forces minister of Baigao District, when implementing technological reforms in 1956, failed to explain the benefits of dryland rice planting well, and he himself did not demonstrate it, so he was anxious and forced the masses to plant it. Afterwards, the masses composed a rhythmic verse about him: "Minister An, striding across the countryside, with a pistol hanging behind his butt, running to several townships a day, forcing people to plant dryland rice everywhere." See how good this summary by the masses is; it summarizes his good intentions, and also points out that his working method was not right. The Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China comprehensively and specifically analyzed Comrade An Jianguo's errors and shortcomings, and deeply realized that this coercive style was not just Comrade An Jianguo's problem, but the leadership method problem of the entire Macheng County Committee. With the help of the provincial committee, they decided to change their leadership method. Later, they found the important and correct method of planting experimental plots, which solved the phenomenon of the separation of leadership and the masses, general planning and specific guidance, and political education and professional skills in one fell swoop, and the work style of cadres throughout the county changed greatly. This promoted the county's great leap forward in production in 1957, making Macheng a famous advanced county in Hubei. A key issue here is that the serious subjectivism and coercive errors and shortcomings that occurred in the work of 1956 were treated with the right attitude: they neither closed their eyes and refused to admit their errors and shortcomings, nor pushed these errors all onto their subordinates, or thought that it was just a problem of individual cadres, nor excessively exaggerated these errors and shortcomings, denying achievements and losing confidence, thus losing the direction of struggle; instead, they made a comprehensive analysis of the county's work, made an appropriate assessment of achievements and errors, and clearly understood that their errors and shortcomings were only one finger out of ten, and that this one finger was not completely rotten and had to be cut off, but could be completely cured with treatment. Cadres participating in production and engaging in experimental fields cured this festering finger. The cadres who were opposed by the masses in the past have now become people loved by the masses. Now, the cadres and the broad masses of Macheng County are closely united, and are inspiring their enthusiasm to strive for a bumper harvest in production this year.

Another attitude toward errors and shortcomings is to proceed from a one-sided perspective, lacking an objective and realistic analysis of achievements and shortcomings, either exaggerating errors and denying achievements, or exaggerating achievements and denying errors, or failing to distinguish what is the main and what is the secondary, treating one finger as ten fingers. In this way, it is also impossible to recognize the true root causes of errors, prescribe the right medicine, and come up with good ways to overcome errors. There are also many such examples. In recent years, the bigger things in this regard, such as the comrades who made mistakes on the issue of agricultural cooperativization in 1955, were due to the lack of an objective and comprehensive analysis of some of the errors and shortcomings that occurred in some places in the agricultural cooperativization movement at that time, treating one finger as ten fingers, and taking the clamor and accusations of the well-to-do middle peasants who followed the rich peasants against cooperativization as the opinions of the entire peasantry. They therefore believed that cooperativization had exceeded the level of awareness of the masses and was unacceptable to the masses, and thus proposed the wrong policy of "resolutely shrinking" and stopping development, pouring cold water on cadres and the masses, seriously affecting the development of the cooperativization movement, which was corrected after criticism by Chairman Mao. Secondly, some comrades lacked an objective and comprehensive analysis of some of the errors and shortcomings that arose in the production upsurge that was set off in 1956 after the victory of the three major socialist transformations. They did not understand that these errors and shortcomings were only one finger out of ten, and that this one finger was only a minor problem, but instead regarded it as a comprehensive and serious problem, thus making some inappropriate assessments, criticizing the masses for being "rash," and pouring a bucket of cold water on the masses' enthusiasm for production, resulting in losses in last year's (1957) production - especially agricultural production. This issue can be found in many local examples. For example, Henan Province developed an irrigation area of 24 million mu in 1956, but some people did not recognize this achievement sufficiently, and instead seized on certain shortcomings in the water conservancy movement and hyped them up, criticizing water conservancy construction as "rash" and satirizing the activists who built water conservancy as "Foolish Old Men" and "spendthrifts," which dampened the enthusiasm of the masses in some areas. In 1957, the province only developed an irrigation area of 5 million mu. This past winter and spring, the people of the province have inspired their enthusiasm, and as of February 22, preliminary statistics show that the province has developed an irrigation area of 32.69 million mu. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also proposed the slogan "Take advantage of the victory to work hard for three months and basically realize water conservancy," estimating that another 20 million mu can be developed before the wheat harvest. The yield of paddy fields is generally twice as much as that of dryland fields, and this alone shows the bad influence of denying achievements, exaggerating shortcomings, and treating the shortcomings of one finger as the shortcomings of ten fingers.

These two different attitudes toward errors and shortcomings represent two different ways of thinking. The first is the method of dialectical materialism, which is Chairman Mao's way of thinking, and is the attitude of the promoters; the second is the method of metaphysics, which is the attitude of the obstructors. The former is to look at problems objectively and comprehensively, while the latter is to look at problems subjectively and one-sidedly. The one-sided view is a way of thinking that is most harmful to the cause of revolution and construction. It can seize on one point, exaggerate it as much as possible, and ignore the rest. With this method, it is possible to deny all achievements and also to defend all errors. Therefore, the one-sided view is also a sophistical view, which is fundamentally different from the way of thinking of dialectical materialism.

Dialectical materialism believes that only a comprehensive view can understand the whole picture of things and make it possible to grasp the essence of things; only by truly understanding the overall situation can local problems be solved correctly. The same is true for errors and shortcomings in work. Only by putting it in the overall situation and comparing it with achievements can its true situation be revealed. It is impossible to correctly understand the nature and magnitude of errors without the overall situation. Because size and weight are relative. If compared with things that are larger or smaller, lighter or heavier, the earth can be small, the grain of rice can be large, the cicada's wing can be heavy, and a thousand pounds can be light. Therefore, it is impossible to judge achievements and errors without the overall situation and without certain times and conditions. The result is either exaggerating achievements or exaggerating errors, or failing to distinguish between the primary and the secondary. Therefore, it is very important to look at problems comprehensively and avoid one-sidedness.

Right-wing elements say that we have turned "achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are the secondary thing" into a formula. This can indeed be said to be a formula, because it correctly reflects our general and overall situation. We oppose formalism, but we do not reject any formula. Scientific formulas drawn from practice can help people correctly understand things. Of course, saying that "achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are the secondary thing" is in terms of the overall situation, and does not mean that in any individual case, shortcomings are "secondary." If we do not analyze it and say that a cadre whose ten fingers have rotted nine fingers is "achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are the secondary thing," then it can only be sarcasm. We Communists have always opposed this attitude. Facts show that the right-wing elements attack our view that "achievements are the main thing and shortcomings are the secondary thing" based on their reactionary position. Their purpose is to negate the achievements of our country's socialist construction,打击干部和群众的积极性和创造性，企图使资本主义在中国复辟and打击干部和群众的积极性和创造性，企图使资本主义在中国复辟. This is fundamentally different from the exaggeration of errors and denial of achievements by some of our cadres due to their incorrect way of thinking. This point should be distinguished and not confused.

Why do errors and shortcomings occur in our work? Is it possible not to happen? Of course, it would be best if there were no errors and shortcomings in any work, but this can only be our goal of struggle, and it is almost impossible in fact. Lenin once said: "A clever person is not a person who does not make mistakes. There is no one and there cannot be anyone who does not make mistakes. A clever person does not make major mistakes and at the same time is able to quickly and easily correct such mistakes." Lenin said these words very well. Don't treat people and yourself as people who will never make mistakes. Not making mistakes can only be deceiving yourself. We must strive to improve ourselves and strive to make fewer mistakes and not make major mistakes, that is, not to make errors of a line, and to be able to correct mistakes quickly when they are made. For those who make mistakes, do not hold an attitude of deep hatred. As long as they are willing to correct them, they should be given help. Don't be complacent because others have made mistakes and you have not made them. This is not right. Errors are often the precursor to correctness. The question is whether to correct them. If they can be corrected and lessons learned, errors can become "the mother of success." Therefore, errors and shortcomings cannot be regarded as absolutely bad things.

Achievements and shortcomings, advanced and backward, are the two aspects of contradiction. Where there are achievements, there will be shortcomings, and where there is advancement, there will be backwardness. Each new achievement and advancement is the overcoming of old shortcomings and backwardness. Overcoming shortcomings and backwardness will make the work take a step forward. Under the new conditions, new shortcomings and backwardness will appear, and then these shortcomings and backwardness will be overcome again, and then a leap forward will be made. Revolutionary work is developed endlessly in this way, and each overcoming of shortcomings and backwardness makes the work and the masses take a step forward. In this way, shortcomings and backwardness are unavoidable phenomena in work. The responsibility of leaders lies in being able to go deep into reality, understand the problems that exist in current work, and solve them in a timely manner, rather than being high above, not understanding the situation below, or turning a blind eye, or wanting to solve them but being unable to do anything about it. The difference between good and bad leaders lies in this, not in saying that there are no errors and shortcomings in the work of good leaders. Not admitting that there are errors and shortcomings in one's work, and being satisfied with the existing achievements, will only lead to becoming backward and will not bring any benefits.

It is inconceivable to build socialism in such a backward Eastern country with a population of 600 million and to do things that predecessors have never done without making mistakes. The Chinese people are building socialism today because they have the rich experience of the Soviet Union for forty years as a reference, and they can avoid many detours. This is a very favorable condition in our socialist construction. But the experience of the Soviet Union can only be used for reference, and cannot be copied, because each country has its own characteristics. Especially because of the economic and cultural backwardness of old China, it is difficult for us not to make errors and shortcomings on the road to socialism and communism. In the past, we have made many mistakes. Many mistakes have been overcome or are being overcome. There will be mistakes in the future, and we must overcome these mistakes with unremitting efforts. Only in this way can we progress and move from victory to victory.

Admitting that there are errors and shortcomings in our work, and believing that this is "secondary," is one finger out of ten, is by no means defending errors and shortcomings, by no means deliberately concealing our own errors and shortcomings, but in order to better overcome these errors and shortcomings, boost confidence and courage, and strive for greater victories. Neither be proud and complacent because of victory, nor be panicked and stagnant because of certain errors and shortcomings. This is the attitude we should have.

Now hundreds of millions of people across the country are struggling with nature with the spirit and momentum of moving mountains and overturning seas, building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, eliminating the four pests, and making high mountains bow their heads, rivers give way, slopes turned into flat land, and dry fields turned into paddy fields; industry, culture and education, and other aspects of work are also developing by leaps and bounds; errors and setbacks will still occur. We must continuously improve our working methods, improve our thinking, overcome all the shortcomings and errors in our work in the struggle, distinguish between ten fingers and one finger, and no longer pour cold water on the masses and cadres. We must break all conservative ideas, break all obstacles that hinder the development of productive forces, muster up courage, ride the wind and waves, and forge ahead bravely. Chairman Mao said that in the cause of socialist construction, "spirit can be encouraged but not discouraged," which is very correct.

Let the right-wing elements and all reactionary elements ridicule and blame us for the errors and setbacks in this great struggle! But we have the right to be proud. Our nation has awakened, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have begun the great and glorious cause of socialist construction, and have achieved great achievements, thus enabling China to enter a new historical era, that is, a new era of consciously transforming nature and also transforming oneself to build a great, happy and prosperous socialist society.

    九个指头和一个指头
    李琪
    现在，全国人民奔腾起来了！真是众志成城，瞬息万变，奇迹一个接着一个地出现。但在这革命大跃进的形势中，也有一些“工愁善虑”的人担心会不会出“乱子”，犯错误，发生缺点。这就产生了一个如何对待我们的事业中的错误和缺点的问题。
    我们在干着亘古未有的新奇事业。我们已经做了并且还要做出更加伟大的前无古人的事情。在这样的事业中，产生一些缺点是在所难免的。但是，只要我们的工作不发生根本路线的错误，成绩总是主要的。成绩和缺点的关系，是九个指头和一个指头的关系。右派分子在这个问题上曾经大做文章，他们采取“攻其一点，尽量夸大，不及其余”的手法，向党向人民大举进攻。而有些同志，譬如那些“工愁善虑”的人，也往往分不清大局和小局、一般和个别、主流和支流的区别，分不清九个指头和一个指头的关系，往往把一个指头的缺点、错误看成或者夸大为九个指头甚或十个指头的缺点、错误，一叶障目，不见泰山；因而失去前进的信心，甚或迷失方向。因此必须辨别清楚成绩和缺点的关系问题。
    这个问题，是思想方法问题，也是领导艺术中一个很重要的问题。对这个问题解决得好，就会提高干部、群众的信心，鼓起他们的干劲，促进工作大跃进；如果解决得不好，就会使干部、群众泄气，失去信心。所以纠正工作中的错误和缺点，必须采取正确的态度。
    对待错误和缺点，可以有两种不同的态度。一种是从全面出发，实事求是地估计成绩和错误，分清错误的性质和大小，寻出它的产生根源，从而提出正确的克服办法。这是马克思主义的态度。经验证明，凡是采取这种态度来对待错误和缺点的，都把事情办好了，团结了干部和群众，提高了大家的觉悟和信心，克服了错误，实现了工作的大跃进。这种事例很多，这里且举麻城的工作来说明。
    大家知道，麻城是湖北一个有名的先进县，在今天也是全国的先进旗帜之一。据参观回来的同志谈，麻城工作确实做得好，不仅农业生产，就是其他许多工作也都做得很不错。但两年前的麻城却不是这样。当时麻城也和全国有些地方一样，在工作上有很大的成绩，也有严重的错误和缺点。例如，1956年的生产规划，是几个县委同志坐在办公室一条一条想出来的，不少地方不切合实际，在贯彻执行中限于乡社干部的水平又不能因地制宜，因而当时曾相当普遍地发生了严重的主观主义和强迫命令的作风。他们有这么一个故事：白杲区的武装部长安建国同志，在1956年执行技术改革的时候下旱秧的好处群众不懂，他自己也没有做出样子来，着急得没有办法，就逼着群众下。事后群众给他编了一个快板：“安部长，胯老乡，屁股后面挂手枪，一天跑了好几个乡，到处逼人下旱秧。”你看，群众这个总结多好，既把他的好心总结出来了，也指出了他的工作方法不对头。中共麻城县委全面而具体地分析了安建国同志的错误和缺点，并且深刻地认识到这种强迫命令作风不是安建国同志一个人的问题，而是整个麻城县委的领导方法问题。在省委的帮助下，他们决心改变他们的领导方法，后来他们就找到了种试验田这个重要而正确的方法，一举解决了领导和群众、一般规划和具体指导、政治教育和业务技术三者脱节的现象，全县干部作风为之大变。这就促成了该县1957年的生产大跃进，使麻城一跃而成为湖北著名的先进县。这里的一个关键问题，就是对1956年工作中发生的严重的主观主义、强迫命令的错误和缺点，采取了正确的态度来对待：既不是闭着眼睛不承认自己的错误和缺点，或者把这些错误全推到下级身上，或者认为只是个别干部的问题，也不是把这些错误缺点过分夸大，否认成绩，失去信心，因而迷失了奋斗的方向；而是对全县工作作了全面地分析，对成绩和错误作了恰当的估计，清楚地了解到自己的这些错误缺点只是十个指头中的一个指头，而且这一个指头也还不是全烂掉了非割去不可，而是经过治疗完全可以治好的。干部参加生产，搞试验田，就把这一个生了脓疮的指头治好了，过去为群众反对的干部，今天已成为群众爱戴的人了。现在麻城县的干部和广大群众密切团结一致，正在鼓起干劲，争取今年生产的大丰收。
    另一种对待错误和缺点的态度，是从片面出发，对成绩和缺点缺乏客观地实事求是地分析，不是夸大错误否认成绩，就是夸大成绩否认错误，或者分不清哪是主要的，哪是次要的，把一个指头看作十个指头。这样也就不能认识错误产生的真正根源，对症下药，提出克服错误的好办法来。这种事例也不少。近几年来在这方面较大的事情，如1955年在农业合作化问题上犯错误的同志们，就是由于对当时农业合作化运动中某些地方发生的一些错误和缺点，缺乏客观地全面地分析，把一个指头看成是十个指头，并把跟着富农跑的富裕中农对合作化的叫嚣、责难，当成是整个农民的意见，于是认为合作化已超过群众的觉悟水平，群众接受不了，从而提出了“坚决收缩”，停止发展的错误方针，给干部和群众泼了冷水，严重影响了合作化运动的发展，后经毛主席批评才纠正过来。其次是有些同志对1956年在三大社会主义改造胜利后掀起的生产高潮中产生的某些错误和缺点，缺乏客观地全面地分析，不了解这些错误和缺点，只是十个指头中的一个指头，而且这一个指头也是个小毛病，而把它看成是全面的、严重的问题，从而作了一些不适当的估计，批评群众“冒进”了，给群众生产热情泼了瓢冷水，致使去年（1957年）的生产——特别是农业生产受到损失。这个问题，在许多地方的事例中都可以找到证明。如河南省1956年发展灌溉面积二千四百万亩，但有一部分人对这一成绩认识不足，反而抓住水利运动中某些缺点大肆渲染，批评水利建设“冒进”了，讽刺兴修水利的积极分子是“愚公”，是“败家子”，致在部分地区挫伤了群众的积极性，1957年全省只发展了灌溉面积五百万亩。去冬今春，全省人民鼓起了干劲，至2月22日止，初步统计全省已发展灌溉面积三千二百六十九万亩。中共河南省委并提出“乘胜大干三个月，基本实现水利化”的口号，估计在麦收前还可发展二千万亩。水田的产量比旱田一般要多收一倍，只这一项，也就可以看出否认成绩，夸大缺点，把一个指头的缺点看成十个指头的缺点的恶劣影响了。
    这两种对待错误和缺点的不同态度，表现着两种不同的思想方法。第一种是辩证唯物主义的方法，也就是毛主席的思想方法，是促进派的态度；第二种是形而上学的方法，是促退派的态度。前者是客观地、全面地看问题，后者是主观地、片面地看问题。片面观点，是一种对革命和建设事业最有害的思想方法，它可以抓住一点，尽量夸大，不及其余。用这种方法，可以否认一切成绩，也可以为一切错误辩护。所以片面观点，也就是一种诡辩论的观点，它是和辩证唯物主义的思想方法根本不同的。
    辩证唯物主义认为：只有全面观点才能了解事物的全貌，才有可能把握事物的本质；只有真正了解了全局的问题，才能正确地解决局部的问题。对于工作中的错误缺点来说也是一样。只有把它放到全局中和成绩比较起来看，才能显示它的真实情况，离开了全局要正确地了解错误的性质、大小是不可能的。因为大小轻重都是相对的，如果和它更大更小、更轻更重的东西来比，则地球可以为小，米粒可以为大，蝉翼可以为重，千钧可以为轻。因之，离开了全局，离开了一定的时间和条件，是无法判断成绩和错误的，其结果不是夸大了成绩，就是夸大了错误，或者分不清主次。所以说看问题要全面，切忌片面性，这是非常重要的。
    右派分子说我们把“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”变成一条公式，这确乎可以说是公式，因为它正确地反映了我们的普遍的总的情况。我们反对公式主义，但并不是排斥任何公式。从实际中提出来的科学公式，是可以帮助人们正确认识事情的。当然，说“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”，是就全局来说的，并不是说在任何个别情况下缺点都是“次要的”。如果不加分析，对于某些十个指头已烂了九个指头的干部，还说他是“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”，那只能是讽刺。我们共产党人从来就是反对这种态度的。事实说明，右派分子攻击我们“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”这一观点，是基于他们的反动立场，其目的就是为了否定我国社会主义建设的成就，打击干部和群众的积极性和创造性，企图使资本主义在中国复辟。这和我们某些干部由于思想方法不对头而夸大错误、否认成绩是有着根本的不同。这点应该分清楚，而不要混为一谈。
    为什么我们工作中会发生错误和缺点呢？能不能不发生？当然，做任何工作都没有一点错误和缺点，那是再好不过的事了，但这只能是我们奋斗的目标，事实上几乎是不可能的。列宁曾说过：“聪明人并不是不犯错误的人。不犯错误的人是没有而且也不可能有的。聪明人是不犯重大错误，同时又是能迅速而容易地纠正这种错误的人。”列宁这些话说的很好。对人对己都不要看成是从来不会犯错误的人，不会犯错误只能是自欺欺人。我们要努力提高自己，争取少犯错误和不犯重大错误，即不犯路线性的错误，而且犯了错误要能很快改正过来。对于犯错误的人，不要抱深恶痛绝的态度，只要他愿意改正，都应给以帮助。也不要以为别人犯了错误，自己没有犯而沾沾自喜。这样就不对了。错误常是正确的先导，问题在于改不改，如能改正，取得教训，错误是可以成为“成功之母”的。所以不能把错误、缺点看成是绝对的坏事。
    成绩和缺点，先进和落后，乃是矛盾的两个方面。有成绩就会有缺点，有先进就会有落后，而每次新的成绩和先进的取得，也就是对旧的缺点和落后的克服。克服了缺点和落后，就会使工作跃进一步。在新的条件下又会出现新的缺点和落后，从而再克服这些缺点和落后，再向前跃进。革命工作就是这样无止境的发展下去的，而每次对缺点和落后的克服，都使工作和群众提高一步。这样看来，缺点和落后乃是工作中不可避免的现象。领导者的责任，就在于能深入实际，了解当前工作中存在的问题，及时地加以解决。而不是高高在上，不了解下情，或者熟视无睹，或者想解决而又束手无策。领导者的好与坏的区别就在于此，而不是说领导好的地方，工作中就没有错误和缺点。不承认自己工作中有错误和缺点，满足于已有的成绩，其结果只能使自己成为落后，而不会带来任何益处。
    在六亿人口这么一个落后的东方大国中建设社会主义，做前人所未做过的事，不犯错误是不可设想的。中国人民今天建设社会主义，因为已有了苏联四十年的丰富经验可作参照，可以少走许多弯路，这是我们建设社会主义中的一个十分有利的条件。但苏联的经验也只能供我们参照，而不能照搬，因为每个国家都有自己的特点。特别由于旧中国的经济文化落后，所以我们在走向社会主义、共产主义的道路上，也就很难不发生错误和缺点。过去我们已犯过不少错误，许多错误我们已经克服了，或正在克服着。今后还会有错误发生，我们对于这些错误也还是要以百折不挠地努力来克服它。只有这样，我们才能进步，才能由胜利走向胜利。
    承认我们工作中有错误有缺点，并认为这是“次要的”，是十个指头中的一个指头，这决不是替错误和缺点辩护，决不是有意掩盖我们自己的错误和缺点，而是为了更好地克服这些错误和缺点，鼓起前进的信心和勇气，争取更大的胜利。既不要因胜利而骄傲自大，踌躇满志，也不要因某些错误缺点而惊惶失措，停滞不前。这就是我们应有的态度。
    现在全国数亿人民正在以移山倒海的精神和气魄，兴修水利，积肥，除四害，和自然搏斗，要使高山低头，河水让路，坡地改平地，旱田变水田；工业、文教以及其他各方面的工作，也都在一日千里地飞跃地发展着；错误和失利也还是会有的。我们要在斗争中不断改进我们的工作方法，提高我们的思想，克服我们工作中的一切缺点和错误，分清十个指头和一个指头，而不要再给群众和干部泼冷水。我们必须打破一切保守思想，打破一切束缚生产力发展的障碍，鼓足勇气，乘风破浪，奋勇前进。毛主席说，在社会主义建设事业中，“气可鼓而不可泄”，这是非常正确的。
    让右派分子和一切反动分子们讥笑、责难我们在这一伟大斗争中的错误和失利吧！但我们有权自豪，我们的民族已经觉醒了，中国人民在共产党的领导下已经开始了社会主义建设这一伟大而光辉的事业，并已取得了巨大的成就，从而使中国进入到一个新的历史时代，即自觉地改造自然同时也改造自己以建设伟大的幸福繁荣的社会主义的新时代。
