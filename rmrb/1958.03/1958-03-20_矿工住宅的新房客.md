    New Tenants in Miners' Housing
    By our reporter Lu Munong

    These days, the miners and their families in the western suburbs of Fuxin City are spreading a fresh story: the Party Secretary and Mine Manager of Ping'an Coal Mine, along with many leading cadres, came to this miners' residential area ten days ago on a Sunday. Some drove horse-drawn carts, some pushed handcarts, bringing their children and families. They unloaded furniture and luggage, moving into some small earthen houses that had long been unoccupied and used as warehouses, without disturbing the residents.

    In the first few days after settling down, many miners and their families didn't understand why these leading cadres had moved into the miners' residences. Some curious girls ran to the family committee to inquire about this novelty; some guessed that the small Western-style houses where these leading cadres lived must be under repair, and they were temporarily moving here. Later, people learned from the cadres of the residential area's family committee that they had come here to settle down. This was a new thing, and it quickly spread to the homes of three or four thousand miners, sparking much discussion. Some old women, looking at the thin Party Secretary Ding Yushan and the tall and stout Mine Manager Chen Haishan, staggering under the weight of two buckets of water, didn't quite believe they could live here for long. To be honest, in the past ten years or so, although these leading cadres had been busy all day long, leading the workers in production, they had little contact with the workers, and their family lives were also quite different from the workers'. They lived in cadre residences, small Western-style houses with running water and heating left by the Japanese; they had never carried anything on their shoulders. Naturally, carrying more than sixty catties of water from the water station more than half a kilometer away was indeed a struggle to even move.

    It was impossible to shrink back in the face of these small difficulties. They fully understood the importance of this move to live with the workers in the miners' residences. They persisted for ten consecutive days, finally building up their strength, carrying three or four buckets of water as steadily as the young miners. Those old women who had been watching the spectacle changed their tune, praising these leading cadres for being as capable and hardworking as their miner sons.

    A few days ago, the Party Secretary and Mine Manager cleaned up the areas in front of and behind their own houses and then went on to clean the streets and alleys in front of other people's houses. This action of theirs made many miners and their families feel embarrassed. In an instant, thousands of workers' families, students, and workers on break all ran out to clean the streets, clearing away piles of snow, garbage, and manure, and the miners' residential area, stretching for several kilometers, was suddenly clean. The street cadres said that since these leading comrades moved into the miners' residences, the street work had become easier. Any task, as long as it was called for, they would take the lead in doing it.

    To lead production well, one must first understand people. After moving into the miners' residences, the Party Secretary and Mine Manager no longer sat at home reading and studying dead materials from reports in the evenings. Instead, they visited workers' families, invited workers to their homes as guests, or went to the library and club to read and play games with the workers. In just a few days, they made many worker friends, learned about some of the workers' demands and thoughts, and were also understood by many workers. One day, a coal miner visited the Mine Manager's home and, seeing that the Mine Manager's home was very simple, couldn't help asking how much the Mine Manager's monthly salary was. When the Mine Manager mentioned the amount of his monthly income, the worker exclaimed in surprise and hurriedly said, "Your salary isn't even as much as I earn, but we always thought the Mine Manager's salary would be more than five workers' salaries." Through these even short-term interactions, many workers regarded these leading cadres as their comrades and were willing to open their hearts to them. Some were willing to talk to the Party Secretary and Mine Manager about their plans, how they intended to learn new technologies, and even some workers were willing to discuss with these leading cadres how to persuade their wives to be thrifty. One evening, in the library, some old miners gathered around several leading comrades and chatted intimately. They suggested, "Workers hope that the leading comrades will stand among the workers, promptly discover and solve some of the difficult problems in production." These words of the miners seemed like a key, opening the minds of these leading comrades. They raised these words at the Party committee meeting and made the following resolution: To take another dose of the "medicine to eliminate official airs" — stipulating that on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, the office should be moved to the pithead; some cadres at the pithead also moved their offices underground, participating in production, studying problems, solving problems, and leading production simultaneously. After working according to this new work method, they were able to discover many important problems every day, and most of these problems were thoroughly solved on the same day.

    What was learned about the workers in the ten years spent in the "cadre residential area" was not as deep and broad as what was learned in these ten days. Mine Manager Chen Haishan said when talking to the reporter about the gains of moving to the miners' residence for ten days: These years haven't been short, but there was little interaction with the workers in their spare time, which gradually isolated them from the workers in terms of life. Some workers were sick for three or four years, and the leading cadres didn't know; the workers' thoughts, difficulties, and living conditions were also not well understood. He paused, as if talking to himself, and said: "For a Communist Party member, what could be more dangerous than being divorced from the masses!"

    It is likely that this Mine Manager, based on such an ideological understanding, has drawn up a small plan for himself. He plans to put political theory study time in every morning, use the entire evening to participate in workers' activities; to become familiar with and make friends with twenty workers each month; and within two years, to become familiar with the three or four thousand workers living in this residential area and their situations. He said optimistically that when his plan is realized, he, as a business leader, will have more ears and eyes, more hands and feet, and the Party's mass line will be easily implemented.

    矿工住宅的新房客
    本报记者　鲁牧农
    这些天来，阜新市西郊矿工住宅的矿工和他们的家属们，传诵着这样一件新鲜事儿：平安煤矿的党委书记、矿长和好多领导干部，在十多天前的一个星期天，有的赶着马车，有的推着手车，携儿带女来到这个矿工住宅区。他们卸下家具和行李，没惊动住宅区的人们，就搬到老早就没人居住、留作仓库的一些小土房里。
    才安下家的那几天，许多矿工和他们的家属，不理解这些领导干部搬到矿工住宅里为了什么。一些好奇的姑娘们，跑到家属委员会探听这件新鲜事儿的来由；有些人猜想一定是这些领导干部住的小洋房要修理，暂时搬来这里住的。后来，人们从住宅区家属委员会干部的口里，才知道他们是来这里安家落户的。这可是个新事，它像一阵风，很快刮到三四千户矿工的家里，人们议论纷纷。有些老太太看着瘦瘦的党委书记丁玉山和又高又胖的矿长陈海山，被两担水压得东摇西晃的样子，就不太相信他们能在这里住得长久。说真的，十来年间，这些领导干部，虽然成天忙忙碌碌，领导着工人们进行生产，但他们很少和工人们接触，自己的家庭生活也和工人们不大一样。他们住的干部住宅，是日本人留下的有自来水有暖气设备的小洋房；他们肩上没有挑过东西。很自然，从一里开外的水站挑六十多斤的水，确是挪步都感到吃力。
    在这些小小的困难面前是不能退缩的。他们十分明白，这次搬到矿工住宅同工人同住的重要意义。他们一连坚持了十天，终于把自己锻炼得结实了，一连挑上三四担水，就像年轻的矿工们走的一样稳当。原来那些在一旁看笑话的老太太也改变了口气，称赞这些领导干部和她们的矿工子弟一样能干，一样能吃苦。
    前几天，党委书记和矿长，打扫完自家的房前房后又去打扫人家房前的街道和小巷。他们的这个行动，使得许多矿工和他们的家属很不好意思。一刹时，几千户工人家属、学生和歇班的工人，都跑出来打扫街道，把一堆堆的积雪，垃圾和粪便清扫了出去，纵横几里的矿工住宅区顿时清洁起来。街道的干部说，自从这些领导同志搬进矿工住宅以后，街道工作好做了，什么工作只要一号召，他们就带动大家干。
    要领导好生产，就要先了解人。这个矿的党委书记和矿长，搬到矿工住宅以后，到晚间，再不是坐在家里阅读和研究汇报上来的死材料，而是去访问工人家庭，或者约工人到自己家里作客，或是到图书馆、俱乐部同工人一起读书和游戏。这样，只不过几天，他们就交上了好多工人朋友，了解了一些工人的要求和思想情况，自己也被许多工人所了解。一天，有个采煤工人到矿长家里去作客，看见矿长家里很朴素，不禁问起矿长每月的工资有多少。当矿长刚说出他每月工资收入的数目，这位工人惊奇的吐了吐舌头，赶忙说：“你的工资，还没有我拿的多呀，可是以前我们总认为矿长的工资能比五个工人的工资还多。”经过这些即使短时期的交往，不少工人都把这些领导干部看作自己的同志，愿意把心交给他们。有的人愿意和党委书记、矿长谈谈自己心里盘算的事情，谈谈自己打算怎样学习新技术，甚至有的工人还愿意和这些领导干部商量怎样劝导老婆省吃俭用。一天晚上，在图书馆里，一些老矿工凑到几个领导同志跟前坐下，亲切的叨唠起来。他们提出：“工人们希望领导同志站在工人中间，及时发现和解决生产中的一些困难问题。”矿工们的这段话，好像一把钥匙，打开了这几位领导同志的心窍。他们把这几句话，提到党委会上研究，并且作出了这样的决议：再服一服“打掉官气的良药”——规定在每个星期二、四、六三天里，把办公室搬到坑口去；有些坑口的干部也把办公室搬到井下，边参加生产，边研究问题，边解决问题，边领导生产。他们按照这个新的工作方法工作以后，每天都能发现许多重要的问题，这些问题又多半是在当天就被彻底解决了。
    在“干部住宅区”住了十来年所了解的工人情况，也不及这十几天了解的深和广。矿长陈海山在和记者谈到搬到矿工住宅十几天的收获时说：这些年不算短？在业余时间和工人交往很少，这就渐渐地从生活方面把自己孤立起来。有些工人病倒三、四年，我们领导干部不知道；工人的心思、困难和生活情况也不很了解。他停了停，好像自语般地说：“对于一个共产党员来说，还有什么比脱离群众更危险的！”
    这位矿长可能就是在这样一个思想认识的基础上，才给自己新制订出一个小小的规划。他打算把政治理论学习时间放到每天的早晨，用晚上的整个时间来参加工人的活动；一个月要和二十名工人熟悉并交上朋友；两年内，把居住在这块住宅区的三四千户工人和他们的情况熟悉起来。他十分乐观地说，当他这个规划实现的时候，他这个企业领导人，耳目可就多了，手脚也多了，党的群众路线就容易贯彻执行了。
