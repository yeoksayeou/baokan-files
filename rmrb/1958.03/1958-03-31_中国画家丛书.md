“Chinese Painter Series”
To facilitate the study and reference of art workers and art enthusiasts, the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House plans to compile a set of "Chinese Painter Series" in a planned way within a few years, introducing representative painters from various periods in ancient and modern China. Currently, nine types, including "Gu Kaizhi," "Zhan Ziqian," "Zhou Fang," "Wu Daozi," "Xu Xi and Huang Quan," and "Zhao Ji," have been published.
    The main characteristic of this series of books is that it is simple and easy to understand, and it gives a general review of each painter's life and artistic creation. Each book is also accompanied by a number of the painter's representative works. However, judging from the several types that have been published, some evaluations are worth discussing. For example, in the book "Gu Kaizhi," it says, "Gu Kaizhi's painting thoughts are completely in line with today's socialist realism creation principles." This is inappropriate. (Ji)

    “中国画家丛书”
    上海人民美术出版社为便于美术工作者和美术爱好者学习与参考，拟在几年内有计划的编选一套“中国画家丛书”，将我国古今各个时期具有代表性的画家，分别加以介绍。目前已出版了“顾恺之”、“展子虔”、“周昉”、“吴道子”、“徐熙与黄筌”、“赵佶”等九种。
    这套丛书的主要特点是深入浅出，通俗易懂，对每个画家的生平概况和艺术创作都作了概括的评述。每本并附有画家的代表作品多幅。但是从已出版的几种看，有些评价还值得商讨，如“顾恺之”一书中说“顾恺之的绘画思想，全符合于今天的社会主义现实主义的创作原理。”这是不恰当的。　（纪）
