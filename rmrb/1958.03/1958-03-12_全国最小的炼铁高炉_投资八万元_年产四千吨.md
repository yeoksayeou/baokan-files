The smallest iron smelting blast furnace in the country
    Investment of 80,000 Yuan, annual output of 4,000 tons

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory in Jiangsu Province built a blast furnace with a volume of eight cubic meters last year. This is the smallest iron smelting blast furnace in the country, with an annual pig iron output of 4,000 tons. The construction time of the blast furnace was only three months, and it was built in the spirit of thrift, requiring only an investment of 80,000 yuan. This small blast furnace has many advantages: it can fully utilize local decentralized resources, use low-grade ore, use some anthracite coal to replace coke, the production operation is easy, and there are fewer accidents. The utilization rate is high, with one ton of pig iron produced for every 0.73-0.8 cubic meters, close to the utilization rate of large blast furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel. The current production cost of this small blast furnace is 169 yuan per ton, which is cheaper than pig iron transferred from other places. If the state allocates coke or more anthracite coal is used, the cost can be reduced to about 120 yuan.

    全国最小的炼铁高炉
    投资八万元　年产四千吨
    本报讯　江苏苏州市农业机械厂，去年建成了一座八立方公尺的高炉，这是全国最小的炼铁高炉，年产生铁四千吨。高炉的建设时间只有三个月，按节约的精神进行建设，只需投资八万元。这种小高炉有许多优点：能够充分利用当地分散的资源，采用品位较低的矿石；利用部分白煤代替焦炭；生产操作容易，事故较少；利用系数较高，每0.73—0.8立方公尺出一吨生铁，接近鞍钢大高炉的利用系数。这座小高炉目前的生产成本为每吨一百六十九元，比从外地调入的生铁便宜，如果由国家调拨焦炭或更多掺用白煤，成本还可降到一百二十元左右。
