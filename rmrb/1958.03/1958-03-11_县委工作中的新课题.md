New Topics in County Committee Work
    Zeng Zhi

With hundreds of thousands of intellectual cadres going to the countryside, the leadership work of local party committees has added a new topic: how to lead and manage these cadres who have been sent down to their respective areas so that they can be transformed into both red and expert cadres through labor training within a limited number of years?

It is indeed not an easy task for intellectual cadres who have lived in cities for a long time to change their positions, viewpoints, and thoughts and feelings in a short period of several years. Although they are very active in labor after going down and have great enthusiasm, and are willing to learn from the peasants, there are still some ideological problems that need to be solved, and some noteworthy situations will arise. For example: some people are very active in labor, but are unwilling to participate in social activities; some people have been working for a period of time, but still do not know how to train and transform themselves; some people feel that the organizational life is too loose and urgently require stronger leadership; some people are very concerned about learning and hope that the leadership can make unified arrangements and also hope to be able to supply some spiritual food... In addition to this, there are also some problems in life and labor or some difficulties encountered that need the leadership to help solve.

The original units should be very concerned to solve these problems, but it is impossible to solve them completely, and a large part of the burden will naturally fall on the local party committees. In this regard, the Hejian County Committee of the Communist Party of China has already done a lot of work. They not only promptly solved the problems and difficulties encountered by the sent-down cadres in their lives and labor, and not only cared about the sent-down cadres' requirements for learning and cultural food, but, more importantly, took many measures to strengthen ideological and political leadership over the sent-down cadres. The county committee designated a secretary and a minister to be responsible for leading the work of the sent-down cadres, and members of the county committee also often contacted and interacted with the sent-down cadres; the county committee also separately convened meetings of the main cadres of the relevant townships and communes and meetings of the group leaders of the sent-down cadres to understand the management and education of the sent-down cadres and their labor training. When the county committee found that some sent-down cadres lacked confidence in labor training and their thinking was shaken, or because of life problems and the relationship with the landlords was not good enough, but the township and commune party organizations did not offer criticism, they promptly criticized the township and commune cadres who did not dare to adhere to principles and were too "polite" to the new commune members, and asked them to seriously "manage" the sent-down cadres. And integrate the party and league members among the sent-down cadres with the rural party and league members, so as to facilitate the unified leadership of the sent-down cadres by the rural party organizations.

The Hejian County Committee's approach to caring for the sent-down cadres in all aspects specifically embodies the spirit of the Party and the state being responsible for the sent-down cadres to the end, and some of the measures they have taken to strengthen ideological and political leadership over the sent-down cadres are also worthy of reference and learning by other party committees.

    县委工作中的新课题
    曾志
    随着上百万的知识分子干部下放农村，各个地方党委的领导工作中，又增加了一个新的课题：应该怎样领导和管理这些下放到自己地区的干部，使他们能够在有限的几年内，经过劳动锻炼，改造成为又红又专的干部呢？
    长期生活在城市的知识分子干部，要在短短的几年内，改变立场、观点和思想感情，的确不是一件容易的事情。虽然他们下去以后劳动都很积极，干劲都很大，也愿意向农民学习。但是，仍然会有一些思想问题需要解决，会出现一些值得注意的情况。比如：有些人劳动虽很积极，却不愿意参加社会活动；有些人虽然已经劳动了一段时间，但是还不知道究竟应该怎样来锻炼改造自己；有些人感到组织生活太散漫，迫切要求加强领导；有些人对学习很关心，很希望领导上能作统一的安排，并且希望能够供应一些精神食粮……。除此以外，生活上、劳动上也有一些问题或遇见了一些困难，需要领导上帮助解决。
    这些问题，原单位要十分关心地给以解决，但也不可能完全解决，担子一大部分的很自然地要落在地方党委的身上。在这一方面，中共河间县委已经做了不少工作。他们不仅及时解决了下放干部在生活上、在劳动上发生的问题和困难，不仅关心到了下放干部对学习和文化食粮的要求，而且，更主要的是采取了许多办法对下放干部加强了思想政治领导。县委确定了一个书记、一个部长负责领导下放干部的工作，县委委员也经常和下放干部联系、接触；县委还分别召开了有关各乡、社的主要干部会议和下放干部组长会议，了解下放干部的管理教育情况和劳动锻炼情况。当县委发现某些下放干部对劳动锻炼信心不足，思想发生动摇，或者是因为生活问题和房东关系不够好而乡、社党组织却不提出批评的问题以后，就及时对不敢坚持原则、对新社员过分“客气”的乡、社干部进行了批评，要他们认真把下放干部“管”起来。并将下放干部中的党团员和农村党团员编在一起，以便于农村党组织对下放干部的统一领导。
    河间县委从各方面关心下放干部的做法，具体地体现了党和国家对下放干部负责到底的精神，而他们对下放干部加强思想政治领导所采取的一些办法，也是值得别的党委参考学习的。
