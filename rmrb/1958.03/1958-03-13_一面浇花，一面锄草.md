    Watering Flowers While Weeding

    Literary creation and literary criticism are closely related. In order to prosper creation, we must simultaneously invigorate criticism. The Chinese Writers Association's call to writers across the country for a great leap forward, followed by a symposium on the great leap forward in criticism work, is of great significance.
    Our literary theory and criticism work has made great achievements in recent years, playing a significant role in criticizing bourgeois literary thought and consolidating and developing the Marxist literary front. However, from the perspective of the comprehensive leap forward of literary and art work, criticism work still lags far behind the needs of reality. Regular literary criticism activities (especially reviews of new works) are not active enough.
    This time, in the midst of the great leap forward in the entire literary and art circles, the writing enthusiasm of critics has also been aroused. At the Writers Association's symposium, many critics broke with convention and put forward unprecedented writing plans. In particular, everyone expressed a strong interest in the review of contemporary works and literary short reviews, which is a very gratifying thing.
    The core of literary criticism work is to "water flowers while weeding," to thoroughly defeat revisionism, and also to encourage creation and strengthen the review of new works. We must both destroy and build, and also dare to express original ideas and dare to raise new questions, so that critical articles can be written accurately, vividly, and vividly. To do this, we must first clear the obstacles on the road ahead. For criticism work, there are two major obstacles: one is dogmatism, and the other is the problem of writing style. Dogmatism not only fails to defeat the enemy, but sometimes also hurts comrades; the dryness and boredom of articles, the lack of depth, and the generalization are more common shortcomings in criticism work. To remove these two obstacles, we must deeply study Marxism and the Party's policies, carefully study the characteristics of each writer and each work, and often go to life to breathe the fresh air of real life. Without doing so, it will be difficult to overcome these shortcomings.
    For literary criticism to leap forward, there is also the issue of the team. The quality of our criticism team is not very high. In addition to constantly discovering and cultivating new forces, advocating that writers also write criticism, we must also promote cooperation between critics and writers. Critics should confide in writers and learn more about the joys and hardships of writers' creation, so that both creation and criticism can flourish.

    一面浇花，一面锄草

    文学创作和文学评论是有密切的关联的，为了创作的繁荣，必须同时使评论也活跃起来。中国作家协会在向全国作家发出大跃进的号召以后，召开关于评论工作大跃进的座谈会，是有重要意义的。
    我们的文学理论批评工作，近几年来有很大的成绩，对于批判资产阶级的文艺思想，巩固和发展马克思主义的文艺阵地，起了重大的作用。但是，从文艺工作全面跃进的要求来看，评论工作还是远远赶不上现实的需要。经常性的文学批评活动（尤其是对新作品的评论），是不够活跃的。
    这次在整个文艺界大跃进中间，也激起评论家们的写作热情。在作协的座谈会上，就有许多评论家打破常规，提出了前所未有的写作规划。特别是对于当代作品的评论和文学短评，大家都表现了浓厚的兴趣，这是一件非常可喜的事。
    文学评论工作的中心是“一面浇花，一面锄草”，要彻底驳倒修正主义，也要鼓励创作，加强评论新作品。要破也要立，还要敢于发表创见，敢于提出新的问题，使评论文章能够写得准确、鲜明、生动，这就要首先清除前进道路上的阻碍。对于评论工作来说，最大的阻碍有两个：一个是教条主义，一个是文风问题。教条主义既打不倒敌人，有时还伤害了同志；文章的枯燥乏味，不深刻和一般化，这又是评论工作中较普遍的缺点。要清除这两个阻碍，就必须深入地学习马克思主义和党的政策，认真研究每个作家和每篇作品的特点，和经常到生活中间去，呼吸现实生活中的新鲜空气，不这样，就很难克服这些缺点。
    文学评论要跃进，也还有个队伍问题。我们的评论队伍质量都不很高。除了不断地发现和培养新生的力量，提倡作家也写评论，还必须促进评论家和作家的合作，评论家要和作家谈心，更多地了解作家创作的甘苦，使得创作和评论都繁荣起来。
