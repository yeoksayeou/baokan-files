Xinhua News Agency, March 25th, New York Dispatch: The "New York Post" revealed that at least 40 million people in the United States (equivalent to a quarter of the national population) are currently under surveillance by public or private detective agencies.

    This newspaper recently published an interview by its reporter, Mike Fels, with McNamara, the president of the New York Crime Academy. The interview stated that there is currently an "unimaginable detective network in the United States, including the FBI, police, intelligence security agencies, committees of Congress and state legislatures, private employers, banks, anti-communist organizations, and all kinds of organizations, newspapers, magazines, columnists..."
    This detective network is simply all-pervasive. Anyone who has applied for civil or defense work, sued in court, or expressed a willingness to hold public office, or even anyone who has purchased anything on installment payments, is subject to investigation. There are more than 250,000 people who specialize in peeping into people's private lives, and the number is gradually increasing. Many people work as part-time busybodies and detectives.
    McNamara, the president of the New York Crime Academy who was interviewed, believes that the U.S. Constitution simply does not provide protection for Americans' private lives from interference. He said: "Throughout American history, we have never had any private life free from interference." He asserted: "For fifty or a hundred years, anyone in rural areas has actually been eavesdropped on when making a phone call. This is the policy of the political parties."
    At the same time, the president of this Crime Academy does not consider eavesdropping on phone calls to be immoral. He believes that this, like listening through keyholes, peering in through skylights, secretly taking pictures, tailing people in shifts, columnists casually inquiring about other people's affairs, national magazines and newspapers sending detectives to inquire about people's private lives and publishing it, etc., are all just "detective techniques."
    The interview finally admits that the dog-eat-dog life of capitalist society is the reason for the increasing phenomenon of peeping into people's private lives. (Attached picture)

    美国是特务的天下
    有四分之一的人被侦探钉梢
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”透露，美国目前至少有四千万人（等于全国人口的四分之一）受到公家或是私人的侦探机关的侦察。
    这家报纸不久以前发表了它的记者迈克·菲莱斯对纽约犯罪学院院长麦克纳马腊的访问记。这篇访问记说，目前美国有一个“令人难以想像的侦探网，它包括联邦调查局、警察、情报安全机构、国会和州立法机构的委员会、私人雇主、银行、反共组织和形形色色的组织、报纸、杂志、专栏作家……。
    这个侦探网简直是无孔不入。凡是申请过民政或是国防工作、向法院起诉过或是表示愿意担任公职的人，甚至凡是以分期付款方式购买过任何东西的人，一律受到侦察。专门窥伺人们的私生活的，就有二十五万人以上，而且人数还在逐渐增加。许多人都作兼职的包打听老板和侦探。
    被访问的纽约犯罪学院院长麦克纳马腊认为，美国宪法根本没有规定保障美国人的私生活不受干涉。他说：“在美国的整个历史中，我们从来没有过任何不受干涉的私生活。”他肯定：“五十年或一百年以来，在乡村地区的任何人在打电话的时候其实都被别人偷听过。政党的方针就是这样。”
    同时，这个犯罪学院院长并不认为偷听电话是不道德的事。他认为，这和从钥匙洞偷听、从气窗往里张望、偷偷照相、轮班跟踪别人、专栏作家随便打听别人的事、全国性杂志和报纸派侦探打听人们的私生活并且把它公开等等，都不过是“侦探技术”罢了。
    访问记最后承认，资本主义社会尔虞我诈的生活，是窥伺人们私生活的现象增加的原因。（附图片）
