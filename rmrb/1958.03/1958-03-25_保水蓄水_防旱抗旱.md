Actively carrying out spring irrigation, water storage, drought prevention, and drought resistance is a major event in spring agricultural production.

Since last autumn, North China and Northwest China have been dry with little rain. In Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, and central and western Inner Mongolia, the rainfall in the five months from October last year to February this year was 30% to 60% less than the average for the same period in previous years. Many areas are still experiencing drought and water shortage this spring. Fortunately, in mid-March, most parts of the country experienced rain and snow, and the drought in some areas began to ease. However, some areas still haven't had thorough rain recently, while other areas haven't had any rain at all. Even in areas where there was thorough rain, drought may still occur after a period of time due to high spring evaporation. In particular, North China and Northwest China are prone to drought in spring, with some of the driest areas unable to sow without taking drought resistance measures. There is an old saying: "Spring drought leads to a year's loss!" This reflects the serious threat of spring drought to agricultural production. Therefore, we cannot be blindly optimistic because some areas have had a spring rain, but should take the initiative to step up drought prevention and resistance.

Through the upsurge of water conservancy construction since last winter, many drought-prone areas have built a large number of water conservancy projects. Gansu Province, the province with the most serious drought disasters and the most difficult water conservancy construction in the history of the Northwest Plateau, will increase its irrigated area by more than 13 million mu this year (the province's irrigated area in 1949 was only more than 6 million mu). On a national scale, nearly half of the arable land will be irrigated this year. This is the most favorable condition for us to overcome drought today. We should make full use of these favorable conditions to overcome possible drought disasters!

While carrying out water conservancy projects last winter, North China and Northwest China vigorously carried out winter irrigation, and the winter irrigation area increased significantly compared with the same period in previous years. However, this is still far from meeting the needs of ensuring a great leap forward in agricultural production. There are more than 350 million mu of winter wheat in the country, and most of the wheat fields have not been irrigated once after sowing. Moreover, various provinces have also designated large areas of high-yield wheat fields, with Shandong Province alone having 20 million mu. It is not enough to water these large areas of high-yield fields only once; they must be watered several times, combined with agricultural technical measures, to ensure a substantial increase in production. The leading organs of Shaanxi Province require that all wheat fields and cotton fields in places with irrigation facilities in the province must be watered once as soon as possible, and strive to achieve "three irrigations and two fertilizations" or "five irrigations and three fertilizations" for wheat fields, which is very necessary. There are also vast spring-sown fields waiting for irrigation. Therefore, we should try our best to expand the spring irrigation area so that the land can absorb enough water from the beginning. Only in this way can it grow good crops.

How can we maximize the irrigated area? On the one hand, we should arrange labor appropriately according to the agricultural season, continue construction, adopt the method of "small repairs during busy farming seasons and large repairs during less busy seasons" and organize professional teams, break the conventional practice of stopping construction when spring plowing begins, and implement the water conservancy movement throughout the year, and strive to build more projects and complete them so that they can be put into production this year. On the other hand, we must carefully manage and make full use of all the completed projects, and truly achieve good construction, good management, and good utilization in one place. Not only should we manage and use individual projects well, but also manage and use the entire water conservancy irrigation network well. Every irrigation area, regardless of its size, should establish a sound management organization or select specialized personnel to be responsible for maintaining the project according to appropriate systems, and plan to release water, distribute water, and regulate water.

The irrigation area needs to be expanded, and irrigation technology also needs to be innovated. These two aspects are interconnected. Improved irrigation technology can meet the needs of more farmland with less water. According to the experience of the Jinghui Canal irrigation area in Shaanxi Province, implementing advanced furrow irrigation can save half the water compared with backward flood irrigation. That is to say, the same amount of water can irrigate twice as much cultivated land. The original flow rate of 5 to 6 cubic meters per second in the Longzici irrigation area in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, irrigated 100,000 mu of land; due to the improvement of irrigation technology, it can now irrigate 500,000 mu of land. Other regions have similar examples.

The key issue is whether we can resolutely change the method of flood irrigation and series irrigation, which wastes water and destroys land fertility, and implement reasonable irrigation methods such as furrow irrigation, ridge irrigation, frequent irrigation, and shallow irrigation. Some farmers have suffered from drought in the past. Now that they have water, they always want to use it heavily, thinking that "eating two buns is always better than eating one bun," and that the more water, the better the crops. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. In the autumn of 1956, the Sima Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuge Township, Yanshi County, Henan Province, used deep water to irrigate large areas, which not only hardened and compacted the soil, but also drowned some crops. The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Licun Township in the same county had 13 mu of irrigated land. Last year, they changed from flood irrigation to small ridge shallow irrigation, plus other conditions, and the average grain yield per mu increased from 500 jin in 1956 to 630 jin. These facts all prove that for crops to grow well, it is not about using more water, but about using water at the right time and in the right amount. Some farmers are afraid that changing to furrow irrigation, ridge irrigation, frequent irrigation, and shallow irrigation will require more labor, so they would rather stick to the old ways. On this issue, we need to present concrete facts, calculate the advantages and disadvantages for the farmers, and make them willing to accept new irrigation techniques.

In order to expand irrigation benefits, we must make full use of all projects and try every means to obtain irrigation water. The leading organs of Jilin Province issued a call to farmers throughout the province to "block the peach blossom water," and are now organizing farmers to use various permanent and temporary water storage projects to block and store ice water after thawing to prevent spring drought. Water storage and water conservation are especially important in the South. At present, some areas in Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces have not made full use of ponds, dams, reservoirs, and other projects to store water. In this way, there will inevitably be a shortage of water when a large amount of water is needed. Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, implemented the method of "building canals, storing water, and reforming fields at the same time" in water conservancy construction, and stored a lot of water. However, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee found in its inspection that the existing water storage capacity was far from meeting the needs of transplanting 6 million mu of rice seedlings this year, so it launched a "water supply and water storage campaign" throughout the region. This experience tells us that we should have a clear idea of how much water is enough, and we cannot be blindly complacent because we have stored more water than in previous years. The Yanggan Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Guangde County, Anhui Province, built a reservoir, storing water while building it. When the project was completed, most of the reservoir was filled with water. This proactive approach to using new projects to play a role in drought resistance is worth learning from agricultural cooperatives in various places.

This year, various provinces have newly developed many irrigation areas. The masses in the new irrigation areas lack irrigation experience. It is a glorious task for the old irrigation areas to provide strong technical assistance to the new irrigation areas. Shaanxi Province used methods such as organizing guidance groups from state-owned irrigation areas and running training courses to help the new irrigation areas train irrigation technicians. Now, this practice of imparting technology has broken provincial boundaries, fully demonstrating the close cooperation between regions. In order to promote the technology of leveling and ridging in well-irrigated areas, Anhui Province invited masters from Dingxian County, Hebei Province to widely teach in one county first, and the masses in the well-irrigated areas quickly learned this technology.

Mechanical irrigation and drainage will be greatly developed this year. Approximately 600,000 horsepower of pumping machinery will be supplied to rural areas in the first half of this year. How to manage and use these newly supplied and existing pumping machinery well so that they can play a greater role in agricultural production is also an important issue that must be addressed currently. All areas using mechanical irrigation now need to conduct a general inspection and repair of existing machinery and equipment, and start training drivers and repair personnel as soon as possible, and actively organize the supply of mechanical repair parts.

    保水蓄水  防旱抗旱
    大力进行春灌、蓄水、防旱抗旱，是春季农业生产上的一件大事。
    从去年秋季以来，华北、西北地区就干旱少雨。河北、山西、山东、陕西、甘肃、内蒙古中部和西部，去年10月到今年2月的五个月的降雨量比历年同期减少了十分之三到十分之六。今年春季许多地区仍然干旱缺雨。幸喜3月中旬全国大部地区降了一次雨雪，部分地区的干旱开始解除。但是也有一些地区最近仍然没有降透雨，而另一些地区根本没有降雨。就是降透雨的地区，因为春季蒸发量大，过一个时期还可能发生干旱。特别是华北和西北地区，春季是十年九旱，其中有些最干旱的地区，不采取抗旱措施，春季就无法下种。有一句农谚说：“春旱一年丢！”正反映了春旱对农业生产的严重威胁。所以我们不能因为眼前一些地区降了一次春雨就盲目乐观，而应当掌握主动权，加紧防旱抗旱。
    经过去冬以来的水利建设高潮，许多易受干旱的地区都建成了大量的水利工程。西北高原历史上旱灾最严重、兴修水利最困难的甘肃省，今年就将增加灌溉面积一千三百多万亩（1949年全省灌溉面积只有六百多万亩）。从全国范围看，今年将有接近一半的耕地可以得到灌溉了。这是我们今天能够战胜干旱的最有利条件。我们应当充分利用这些有利条件，战胜可能的旱灾！
    去年冬季各地在兴修水利工程的同时，华北、西北地区大力开展了冬灌工作，冬灌面积比往年同期增加了很多。但是这距离保证农业生产大跃进的需要还很远。全国有三亿五千多万亩冬小麦，大部分麦田播种后还没有得到一次灌溉。并且各省还划定了大面积的丰产麦田，仅山东省就有两千万亩。这些大面积的丰产田仅仅浇一次水还不够，必须多浇几遍，配合农业技术措施，才有大幅度增产的保证。陕西省领导机关要求全省凡是有灌溉设施的地方，麦田、棉田必须赶快普遍浇一次水，麦田争取做到“三水二肥”或“五水三肥”，这是很必要的。还有广大的春播田，也在等待着浇水。因此，我们应当尽力扩大春灌面积，让大地一开始就吸足水分。这样，它才能长出好庄稼。
    怎样才能最大限度地扩大灌溉面积呢？一方面，应当根据农事季节适当安排劳动力，继续进行兴修，采取“农忙小修，小忙大修”和组织专业队的方法，打破以往春耕开始就停止兴修的常规，把水利运动贯彻全年，力争再多修一些工程，并且努力把它们修完，使它们投入今年生产中去。另一方面，还要把修好的全部工程认真管理起来，充分利用起来，真正做到修好一处，管好一处，用好一处。不但把单个的工程管好用好，而且要把整个水利灌溉网管好用好。每一个灌溉区，不论大小，都应当建立起健全的管理机构或选定专管人员，按照适当的制度负责养护工程，有计划地放水、分配水、调剂水。
    灌溉面积要扩大，灌溉技术也要革新。这两方面是互相联系着的。灌溉技术提高了，就可以使较少的水满足较多的农田的需要。根据陕西省泾惠渠灌区的经验，实行先进的沟灌比落后的漫灌能节省一半水量。也就是说，用同样的水量可以多灌一倍的耕地。山西省临汾县龙子祠灌区原来五至六秒公方的流量，浇地十万亩；由于改进灌溉技术，现在可以浇地五十万亩。其他地区也有类似的例子。
    关键的问题在于能否坚决改变那种既浪费用水又破坏地力的大水漫灌串灌方法，而实行沟灌、畦灌、勤灌、浅灌等合理的灌溉方法。有些农民因为过去吃了干旱的苦头，现在有水用了，就总想狠狠地用，以为“吃一个馒头总不如吃两个馒头好”，以为水越多庄稼越好。其实这是误解。河南省偃师县诸葛乡司马农业合作社1956年秋季深水大块浇地，不但使土壤硬化板结，还泡死好些庄稼。同一个县的李村乡曙光农业合作社有十三亩水浇地，去年改大水漫灌为小畦浅浇，加上其他条件，粮食平均亩产量由1956年的五百斤提高到六百三十斤。这些事实都证明，要使庄稼长得好，不在用水多，而在用水适时适度。有些农民怕改用沟灌、畦灌、勤灌、浅灌的方法要多费工，因此宁愿守旧。在这个问题上，需要拿出具体的事实，向农民算清利害的账，使他们乐于接受新的灌溉技术。
    为了扩大灌溉效益，必须充分利用一切工程，千方百计地去取得灌溉用水。吉林省领导机关向全省农民发出了“拦住桃花水”的号召，现正在组织农民利用各种永久性的和临时性的蓄水工程，拦蓄解冻后的冰水，防御春旱。蓄水保水，在南方尤其重要。现在贵州、四川、湖南、浙江、安徽等省的某些地区，没有利用塘坝水库等工程充分蓄水。这样，等到大量用水的时候势必缺水。湖北省襄阳专区在兴修水利中实行了“边修渠、边蓄水、边改田”的方法，蓄水很多。但是，襄阳地委在检查中发现，现有蓄水量还远不能满足今年插秧六百万亩的需要，于是便发动全区群众开展了突击“通水蓄水运动”。这个经验告诉我们，究竟蓄多少水才够用，应当心中有数，不能因为蓄水比往年多了就盲目自满。安徽省广德县杨竿第四农业合作社有一个水库，边修边蓄水，工程完工，水也蓄起大半库了。这种积极利用新工程发挥抗旱作用的做法，很值得各地农业合作社学习。
    今年各省新发展了不少灌区。新灌区的群众缺乏灌溉经验。在技术上大力帮助新灌区，是老灌区的一项光荣任务。陕西省用组织国营灌区派指导组、开训练班等方式，帮助新灌区培养灌溉技术人材。现在，这种传授技术的做法已经打破了省界，充分表现出各地区之间的亲密合作的关系。安徽省为了推广井灌区平地打畦的技术，就到河北定县请师傅先在一个县广泛传授，井灌区的群众很快便学会了这种技术。
    今年机械排灌将有很大发展。今年上半年就将有大约六十万马力的抽水机械供应农村。如何把这些新供应的和原有的抽水机械管理好、使用好，使它们在农业生产上发挥更大的作用，也是当前必须注意解决的一个重要问题。一切使用机械灌溉的地区，现在很有必要对于现有的机械设备普遍进行检修，并及早着手训练司机和修配人员，积极组织机械修配的零件供应工作。
