Grasp Cultivation, Grasp Backwardness
Lin Wei

During a visit to the rural areas of Qin County, Shanxi Province, before the new year, I felt that the issue of cultivation needed special emphasis. Now that spring plowing is about to begin, I sincerely hope that this issue will attract attention in various places.

Qin County suffered a severe drought in 1957. Among the 278 agricultural cooperatives in the county, 157 experienced a reduction in production compared to 1956, and 200 did not meet the "three fix" (三定) production standards. From a passive perspective, one might conclude that "natural disasters are irresistible." However, from another perspective—a positive one—121 cooperatives did not experience a reduction in production under the same drought conditions in 1957, and 23 of them even increased production. Fifty cooperatives met the "three fix" production standards, and another 28 exceeded them. Upon examination, the "three fix" production standards were not unreasonable.

Qin County has 470,000 mu of cultivated land. In 1957, the average grain yield per mu was 151 jin, a decrease of 11 jin compared to 162 jin in 1956. However, not all cultivated land was so pitiful. In the small village of Weijiazhai, with 19 households, under the same natural conditions, the average corn yield per mu reached 450 jin, and the average yield of sorghum and millet both exceeded 300 jin per mu. The summer wheat harvest was very poor that year, but the average yield per mu for the whole year was 250 jin. This was 99 jin more than the county's average and, of course, much more than the low-yielding cooperatives.

In the more than ten agricultural cooperatives I visited, I found a common pattern: the cooperatives that paid close attention to cultivation, especially those that paid attention to the quality of cultivation, had higher yields. The cooperatives that did not pay attention to the quality of cultivation had lower yields. The cultivation mentioned here includes the quantity, quality, and techniques (such as even spreading of manure) of fertilization. However, even if fertilization is excluded and only cultivation in the narrow sense is discussed, the relationship is still very significant. If cultivation is not good, the effects of fertilization and irrigation will be greatly reduced.

Many elderly people frequently shook their heads when talking about cultivation. They were very dissatisfied with the general carelessness of young people towards cultivation. They hoped that young people would learn from the older generation's meticulous attitude and cultivation skills. They often told me how a certain old man hoed millet, how a certain old man turned the soil, and how manure should be collected and spread...

But age is not the main issue. The main issues are whether the cooperative is well-run, whether there are definite quality standards and reasonable remuneration systems for various farm tasks, and whether the system can be effectively implemented.

In the agricultural cooperatives I visited, those with better cultivation quality were due to the fact that the cooperative cadres could seriously inspect the quality of each person's farm work, insist on giving different work points (remuneration) according to different qualities, and resolutely refuse to give work points for those with poor quality, sending them back to redo it. Only when it was done well would work points be given. Cui Youxu (出身 from a hired laborer), the resident cadre of Duanliu Agricultural Cooperative, was a model figure in this regard. Before sowing, he would lead the cooperative's inspection team (with the participation of experienced farmers) to personally inspect all the manure to see if the quantity was sufficient, whether the quality was good, and whether it was evenly mixed. He would personally check whether the seeds met the standards. He would check whether the land for sowing was prepared according to the standards, rolled with stone rollers, and evenly harrowed. Even after rolling, he would dig open the ground to carefully check whether it met the standards. Only when everything was qualified would sowing be allowed. He checked the thinning, weeding, and topdressing very strictly. If someone hoed carelessly, he would personally hoe a sample for them to see, asking them to hoe according to this standard. Otherwise, it would not be accepted. A few people who liked to take shortcuts and be lazy, after being stopped once or twice, would no longer dare to not pay attention to quality. The same was true for others. At first, a few people disliked him, but later they all thanked and supported him because the crops grew exceptionally well. The neighboring Changsheng Cooperative had conditions that were no worse than here, even better in some respects, but the average yield per mu in 1957 was sixty or so jin lower than here. Some fertile riverside land in Changsheng Cooperative was not as good as some hillside crops in Duanliu Cooperative, and the grain harvest was smaller. Here, you can see how important cultivation is.

Of particular note is the issue of the three types of cooperatives (落后社) (backward cooperatives). The three types of cooperatives generally do not have strict cultivation quality standards for various farm tasks. Or there are standards but they cannot be implemented; those that do not meet the standards are also approved and receive work points. Some people can earn forty or fifty points a day (ten points equals one labor day) because they do not do work according to the quality standards. Honest people, seeing that others are getting more work points, and that they are earning less than others despite working hard, quickly learn to do rough work and抢工分 (qiang gong fen) (grab work points). In the end, the quality of cultivation is generally reduced. Some elderly people say that the land is种得立起来了 (zhong de li qi lai le) (planted upright) (if its planted upright it is no longer soil). They are very emotional when talking about this. They demand that those who grab work points be punished or driven away; otherwise, they would contract to cultivate a piece of land themselves.

Due to poor cultivation, the land yields of the three types of cooperatives were generally very low last year, and there was no surplus grain to sell; some even failed to deliver enough public grain. It would be good if the ration could reach an average of 360 jin per person; some were below 350 jin. The defeatist sentiment of the masses is very strong: they shake their heads at everything and think it cannot be done.

The problems here are very different. Some are due to rich middle peasants or landlords and rich peasants playing a role in the dark, deliberately disrupting things. This type is not very common. More often, the Party and League organizations are not functioning, and they cannot act according to principles; the cadres are not united, engaging in sectarianism and fighting each other, each protecting their own group. I come to power, you sabotage; he comes to power, I sabotage; no one can accomplish anything. A cooperative member cultivates the land very poorly, not meeting the standards, and should be sent back to cultivate it again. But the captain and cooperative cadres dare not say anything. Sometimes even if they do say something, there is no way to make the other party recultivate. Some want to punish, others disagree, and in the end, nothing happens. Last year, some three types of cooperatives also implemented contract work and contract production, but it could not be implemented. There were also cooperative cadres and captains who embezzled work points and grain, practiced favoritism and committed irregularities, and this could not be dealt with. This makes the cooperative members unwilling to cultivate carefully, and everyone puts their efforts into their small private plots, and good fertilizers are also brought to the private plots.

To grasp cultivation and engage in intensive farming, the first step is to grasp these three types of cooperatives. We must send capable and experienced cadres like Cui Youxu to reside in the cooperatives to lead and rectify them, and not leave until they are rectified. Duanliu Cooperative was still a backward cooperative in 1956, but it immediately became an advanced cooperative in 1957. The key was to send capable cadres to take charge of the leadership.

Farmland water conservancy and other basic construction are very important. But it is absolutely impossible to ignore the rectification of backward cooperatives, and it is absolutely impossible to ignore cultivation. Ignoring this, even if there is irrigated land, it cannot guarantee a great leap in production. Any good objective conditions must be combined with subjective efforts in cultivation in the current year to take effect. At the same time, because general cooperatives also have some of the same problems as the three types of cooperatives, the significance of rectifying the three types of cooperatives far exceeds the three types of cooperatives themselves.

    抓耕作抓落后
    林韦
    年前在山西沁县农村访问，感觉到耕作问题有特别强调的必要。现在春耕就要开始了，很希望这问题能引起各地注意。
    沁县1957年遭受严重旱灾，全县278个农业合作社就有157个比1956年减产，200个没有达到“三定”的产量标准。从消极方面看，人们可以得出结论说：“自然灾害是无法抗拒的。”但是，从另一方面——积极方面看，1957年有121个社在同样旱灾下并未减产，其中有23个社甚至还增产了。达到“三定”产量标准的有50个社，另外有28个社超过了这个标准。考察“三定”产量标准，也并没有很不合理的地方。
    沁县有47万亩耕地，1957年每亩平均产粮食151斤，比1956年的162斤减少11斤。但并不是所有耕地都这样可怜。19户的小山庄魏家寨在同样的自然条件下，玉米平均亩产达到450斤，高粱和谷子平均亩产都超过300斤。这年夏季小麦收成很坏，但全年总结算，亩产平均是250斤。比全县总平均数多99斤，比低产社当然更多了。
    在访问过的十多个农业社中，我找到了一个共同的规律，就是哪个社对耕作抓得紧，特别注意耕作质量，他们的产量就高。哪个社不注意耕作质量，他们的产量就低。这里所说的耕作，包括施肥的数量、质量和技术（如匀粪）。但是，即使把施肥除过，只谈狭义的耕作，关系也非常大。耕作不好，施肥浇水的效果都会大大减弱。
    有不少老年人在谈到耕作情形时频频摇头。他们很不满意一般年青人对耕作的马虎态度。他们希望年青人学习长辈们对耕作的一丝不苟态度和耕作技巧。他们时常告诉我某某老人锄谷是怎么锄的，某某老人翻地是怎么翻的，以及打粪、撒粪应当怎样怎样……。
    但年龄还不是主要的问题。主要问题是社办得好坏，各种农活有无确定的质量标准和合理的报酬制度，制度是不是能够切实地贯彻执行。
    在我访问过的农业社中，凡是耕作质量较好的，都是由于社干部们能够认真检查各人所做各宗农活的质量，坚持按不同质量给与不同的工分（报酬），质量太坏的坚决不给工分，打回重做，做好了再给工分。段柳农业社的驻社干部崔有绪（长工出身）在这方面是个模范人物。下种以前，他要率领社内检查组（有老农参加）亲自检查所有的粪，看数量够了没有，质量好不好，打匀了没有。要亲自检查种子是否合乎标准。检查下种的地是不是按标准捣好了，用石磙碾了，耙匀了。捣过以后，已经磨好的地，他也得挖开细看，看究竟合不合标准。必须一切合格，才允许下种。对于间苗、锄苗、追肥，他都检查得非常严。有人锄得潦草一点，他就亲自锄个样子给他们看，让他们照这个标准锄。不然不验收。有少数喜欢讨巧偷懒的人，给卡住一两回以后也就再不敢不注意质量了。其他人也一样。开始时有少数人曾经讨厌他，以后都因庄稼长得分外出色而感谢他拥护他了。段柳社的紧邻长盛社各方面条件都不比这里坏，甚至更好些，但1957年平均亩产量却比这里低六十来斤。长盛社有一些肥沃的河边地还不如段柳社的某些坡地庄稼好，收粮多。这里可以看到耕作的关系之大了。
    特别值得注意的是三类社（落后社）的问题。三类社一般没有严格的各种农活的耕作质量标准。或者是有标准而不能执行，不合标准的也一样通过，一样得工分。有的人因为不按质量做活，一天能做到四五十分（十分折一个劳动日）。老实人一看更多的工分由别人得了，自己好好劳动反而会比别人少得报酬，也就赶快学粗作，抢工分。最后是耕作质量普遍降低，有的老年人说是把土地种得立起来了（立起来就不是土地了）。谈话时很动感情。他们要求处分或赶走那些抢工分的人；要不然就一家包一块地种。
    由于耕作不好，三类社去年土地产量一般很低，没有余粮可以卖出；有的甚至交不够公粮。口粮能够达到每人平均360斤就是好的，还有的在350斤以下。群众的失败主义情绪很浓：凡事总摇头，认为办不成。
    这里问题很不一样。有一些是富裕中农或地主富农在暗中起作用，故意搅，这类不太多。更多的是党和团的组织不起作用，不能按原则办事；干部不团结，闹宗派，互相斗争，各护各的一伙人。我上台，你捣旦，他上台，我捣旦，谁也干不成。一个社员耕地耕得很不好，不合标准，应该打回重耕。但队长和社干部都不敢说。有时候说了，对方不重耕也没办法。有人要处分，有人不赞成，结果不了了之。去年有些三类社也实行包工包产，但执行不下去。还有的社干部和队长贪污工分和粮食，循私舞弊，也处理不了。这就使得社员群众无心精耕细作，各人都把力气用在巴掌大的自留地上，好肥料也都弄到了自留地上。
    要抓耕作，搞精耕细作，首先就要抓这些三类社。要派出崔有绪那样有能力有经验的干部驻社领导和整顿，不整顿好就不走。段柳社在1956年还是落后社，1957年马上就变成了先进社。关键就是派了有能力的干部去负责领导。
    农田水利以及其他的基本建设都是很重要的。但绝对不可忽略对落后社的整顿，绝对不可忽略耕作。忽略了这个，即使有了水浇地也还不能保证生产大跃进，任何好的客观条件都得加上当年耕作上的主观努力才能生效。同时，因为一般社也或多或少有一些与三类社相同的问题，所以整顿三类社的意义是远远超过三类社本身的。
