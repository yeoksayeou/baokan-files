Sichuan Peasant's Daily provided material about a plant that can eliminate flies and mosquitoes. The plant is called "Breaking Bowl Flower." Comrades of the Hongguang Cooperative in Pixian County said: The reason it is called "Breaking Bowl Flower" is that adults in the countryside teach children not to touch this plant's body, lest it break and a juice flows out, sticking to the body and rotting the skin. When talking about it, they don't say it like this, but say: If anyone touches this "flower" (plant), when they return home, there will be a danger of accidentally breaking a bowl.

This wild plant, "Breaking Bowl Flower," grows on the edges of fields and beside ditches in rural areas of Sichuan. Farmers in Pixian County collect it and scatter it in manure pits and puddles to kill maggots and mosquito larvae. It can also poison cutworms and rice stem borers, and it is also a good green manure. On March 26th, this newspaper published a message on page seven about Sichuan farmers using "Breaking Bowl Flower" to eliminate flies and mosquitoes. On the right are three photos of "Breaking Bowl Flower."

    打破碗花花
    四川农民报提供了一种具有消灭蝇蚊作用的植物的材料。这种植物名曰“打破碗花花”。郫县红光社的同志们说：其所以叫做“打破碗花花”，是农村中大人们教导小孩子，不要去触动这种植物的身体，使它破裂流出一种汁来，粘在身上，腐烂皮肤。讲时并不是这么说的，而说成：如果谁去触动这种“花花”（植物），回到家里，就会有失手将碗打破的危险。
    “打破碗花花”这种野生植物生长在四川各地农村的田坎边、水沟旁。郫县的农民把它采来撒在粪坑、水氹里，能杀蛆灭孑孓，它还能毒杀土蚕、螟虫，同时它又是一种很好的绿肥。3月26日本报七版刊载了关于四川农民利用“打破碗花花”消灭蝇蚊的消息。右面是有关“打破碗花花”的三张照片。
