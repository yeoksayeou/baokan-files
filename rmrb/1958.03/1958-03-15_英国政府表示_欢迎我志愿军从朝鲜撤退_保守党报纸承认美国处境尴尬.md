Xinhua News Agency, London, March 14th: The British House of Lords concluded its two-day foreign policy debate on the 13th. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Gosford, speaking on behalf of the government on the 13th, said that the British government welcomes China's decision to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, and he hopes that perhaps there is a way to achieve a satisfactory solution to this issue.

At the same time, Gosford rejected a suggestion from Labor Party members of parliament requesting the British government to support the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: London dispatch: The British Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" said today that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has put the United States "in an embarrassing situation."

On the one hand, the newspaper described the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers as "propaganda," but on the other hand, it had to admit that there would be no foreign troops in North Korea, while its "southern neighbor has not achieved this." The newspaper said: "Sooner or later, embarrassing comparisons will begin to emerge in South Korea."

    英国政府表示
    欢迎我志愿军从朝鲜撤退
    保守党报纸承认美国处境尴尬
    新华社伦敦14日电　英国上院13日结束了为时两天的外交辩论。英国外交部政务次官果斯福德在13日代表政府发言说，英国政府欢迎中国宣布从朝鲜撤出志愿军的决定，他希望也许有办法使这个问题获得满意的解决。
    同时，果斯福德拒绝了工党议员提出的要求英国政府支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位的建议。
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国保守党的“每日电讯报”今天说，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜这件事使得美国“陷入窘境”。
    这家报纸一方面把中国人民志愿军的撤离说成是“宣传”，另一方面它又不得不承认，朝鲜北部将没有外国军队，而它的“南部邻居却没有作到这一点”。报纸说：“迟早南朝鲜会开始出现令人难堪的对比。”
