    How to Utilize Biogas?
    A New Book Has Been Published
    Using various organic wastes, after fermentation, to produce biogas, and using it for power generation, water pumping, lighting, and heating—this issue has been given great importance by various regions since this newspaper reported the successful experiment of Hubei Province in researching "bioenergy utilization" on December 20th last year. Many provinces and cities have sent people to Hubei to visit and learn. Now, a new book introducing bioenergy utilization—"The Principles of Bioenergy" by Soviet engineer Comrade Keller—has been reprinted and published. This book has important reference value for our country's current research on "bioenergy utilization."
    Because this book has not yet been finalized, it is temporarily for internal distribution. If any units need it, they can contact the Internal Distribution Group of the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch to order it. (Wei Zhengang, Yu Yongping)

    怎样利用沼气？
    有一本新书出版了
    用各种有机废料，经过发酵，产生出沼气，用它发电、抽水、点灯、取暖。——这个问题，自从去年12月20日本报报道湖北省研究“生物能利用”试验成功的消息以后，受到了各地的重视。许多省市都派人到湖北参观学习。现在，一本介绍生物能利用的新书——苏联工程师凯列尔同志著的“生物能原理”已经翻印出版了。这本书对我国当前研究“生物能利用”问题，有重要的参考价值。
    这本书因为还没有定稿，暂作内部发行。各单位如果需要，可以到新华书店北京分店内部发行组联系订购。　（韦振刚　于永平）
