    Sichuan Fushun County
    Universally Establishes Technical Forums
    (Our dispatch) Fushun County, Sichuan Province, widely organizes technical forums to impart advanced spring plowing production techniques to the broad masses of farmers. According to incomplete statistics from only five districts, there are more than 450 technical forums held by townships, villages, and agricultural cooperatives.
    The technical forums were established by the Fushun County Committee of the Communist Party of China in response to the urgent demand of the peasant masses to learn technology. More than 80% of the county's farmers have already listened to technical lectures. A wave of enthusiasm for everyone to learn advanced technology has formed in the countryside. According to inspections, more than 90% of the early rice seeds sown throughout the county have been treated with advanced techniques such as mud-water selection and baking soda soaking; more than 95% of the seedbeds meet advanced technical specifications.
    The main lecturers at the technical forums in various parts of Fushun County are the heads of the county, township, or agricultural cooperative Party organizations. Based on the outlines and charts compiled and distributed by the county, they use mass gatherings, meeting places, water conservancy construction sites, and other mass occasions to give technical lectures and demonstrations to farmers in simple terms, and change the content of the lectures with the progress of agricultural activities.
    While holding technical forums and extensively discussing technology, Fushun County has trained a total of 100,000 technical hands and more than 20,000 technicians as the backbone for promoting advanced technology.

    四川富顺县
    普遍办技术讲坛
    本报讯　四川省富顺县普遍举办技术讲坛，向广大农民传授春耕生产的先进技术。仅据五个区的不完全统计，分别由乡、村、农业社举办的技术讲坛就有四百五十多处。
    技术讲坛是中共富顺县委应农民群众学习技术的迫切要求创办起来的。全县已有80％以上的农民听过技术讲演。在农村中已形成人人学习先进技术的热潮。据检查，全县播下的早稻种子，90％以上经过泥水选种和小苏打浸种等先进技术处理；95％以上的秧田符合先进技术规格。
    富顺县各地技术讲坛的主讲人都是县、乡或农业社党组织的负责人。他们根据县上编发的提纲和图表，利用集场、会场、水利工地等群众场合，通俗地向农民作技术讲演操作示范，并且结合讲演的内容随农事活动的进展而更换。
    在举办技术讲坛，大讲技术的同时，富顺县各地共训练了十万名技术手和二万多名技术员，作为推广先进技术的骨干。
