Small Scenes of the Wuhan Market
    Early Morning and Late Night Store
    Near the Dazhimen Railway Station in Wuhan, a department store has recently opened to facilitate the purchase of daily necessities by travelers. Its business hours are unusual, from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM in the morning and from 8:30 PM to 12:00 AM in the evening, so it is called the "Early Morning and Late Night Store."
    On the first night the "Early Morning and Late Night Store" opened, around 11 o'clock, two female customers came. One of them was waiting for a train to go elsewhere and had accidentally lost her towel and toothbrush. The "Early Morning and Late Night Store" quickly met her needs. Before leaving, she said to the clerk: The stores along the street are all closed. If you hadn't opened a night market, I wouldn't have been able to wash my face and brush my teeth on the train. Another customer was passing through Wuhan and encountered a sudden drop in temperature. She bought a thermal undershirt at the "Early Morning and Late Night Store" and repeatedly thanked the clerk, praising their spirit of service in facilitating passing travelers.
    Home Delivery
    The experimental store established by cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Commercial Bureau has adopted a door-to-door supply method. Clerks carry dozens of kinds of small daily necessities to streets, government offices, and cooperatives for people to choose from.
    This supply is irregular. Once, when it was snowing, they thought that it would be inconvenient for customers to go to the streets to buy things, so they delivered items such as needles, thread, and laundry soap to nearby neighborhoods, which was warmly welcomed by housewives. Recently, on days when many government offices had just issued salaries, the clerks used their after-meal breaks to deliver daily necessities to nearby government offices to sell. On "March 8th" Women's Day, the female clerks of the experimental store also carried women's supplies to residential areas with fewer department stores.

    武汉市场小景
    早晚商店
    武汉市大智门火车站附近，最近开设了一家百货商店，便利来往旅客购买日用品。它的营业时间与众不同，每天早晨六时到九时，晚间八时半到十二时，所以被称为“早晚商店”。
    “早晚商店”开业的第一天晚上，大约十一点钟光景，来了两个女顾客。其中一个是等候火车赴外地的，不小心把毛巾、牙刷丢失了，“早晚商店”很快就满足了她的需要。她临走时向营业员说：沿街商店都关了门，要不是你们开放夜市，我在火车上就没法洗脸漱口了。另一个顾客是途经武汉，碰到气温骤降，她在“早晚商店”买到了一件卫生衣，连声向营业员道谢，赞扬他们便利过往旅客的服务精神。
    送货上门
    武汉市商业局干部建立的试验商店，采取了一种送货上门的供应方式。营业员带着几十种日常用的小百货，到街道、机关、合作社去供人们选购。
    这种供应是不定期的。有一次天下雪，他们想到顾客上街买东西不方便，就把针线、洗衣肥皂等商品送到附近里弄中去，受到家庭妇女们的热情欢迎。最近，在许多机关刚发工资的日子，营业员们利用饭后休息时间，把日用品送到附近机关去卖。“三八”节那天，试验商店的女营业员，还携带妇女用品，送到百货商店较少的居民区去。
