Window of Friendship

    "Pages of Glory for Soldiers"
    On March 3, 1878, the Russian army helped the Bulgarians break the shackles of Turkish enslavement. How could the Bulgarian people, who had groaned under the cruel Turkish rule for five hundred years, not be grateful to the Russian army? How could they not cherish this memorable day! This year, to commemorate the eightieth anniversary of this day, Soviet and Bulgarian filmmakers co-produced a documentary film describing the heroic history of the Russian army defeating the Turks and the friendship between the Russian and Bulgarian peoples. The film is called "Pages of Glory for Soldiers."
    At that time, there were many famous Russian painters who deeply sympathized with the struggle of the Bulgarian people. They personally went to the army and created many outstanding works with the Russo-Turkish War as their theme. These paintings not only showed the heroic achievements of the Russian army, but also praised the friendship between the Russian and Bulgarian peoples. These precious paintings have become the shots in the new film describing several historical battles and the heroic fighting of the Russian army. The film skillfully, profoundly, and truthfully conveys the thoughts and feelings expressed by the art masters on the screen. This is a very difficult and meticulous task, because these paintings include the works of many art masters such as Repin, Vereshchagin, and Polenov. It is not easy to express them well. Filmmakers in Moscow and Sofia overcame many difficulties and successfully completed this task. The music of the film was composed by the young Bulgarian composer Bilonkov. (Attached picture)

    “军人的光荣之页”
    1878年3月3日，俄国军队帮助保加利亚人打断了土耳其的奴役枷锁。在土耳其残酷统治下呻吟了五百年的保加利亚人民，怎能不感谢俄国军队呢，他们怎能不珍视这个可纪念的日子呢！今年，为了纪念这个日子的八十周年，苏保电影工作者合拍了一部纪录影片，描述当时俄国军队打败土耳其人的英勇史迹，描述俄保两国人民的友谊。这部影片名叫“军人的光荣之页”。
    俄国当时有许多著名画家，非常同情保加利亚人民的斗争。他们都曾亲自到军队中去，以俄土战争为题材，创造了不少杰出的作品。这些画幅一方面表现俄国军队的英勇的功绩，同时也歌颂俄保两国人民的友谊。这些名贵的画，就成为了新影片中描述当时几个历史性战役和俄军英勇奋战的镜头。影片巧妙、深刻而真实地把艺术大师们表现在画面上的思想和感情传达了出来。这是件非常困难而细致的工作，因为这些画中包括列宾、维列沙金、波列诺夫等许多艺术大师的作品。能够很好地表现它们并不是一件容易的事。莫斯科和索非亚的电影工作者克服了许多困难，胜利地完成了这一任务。影片的音乐是由保加利亚青年作曲家毕隆科夫作的曲。（附图片）
