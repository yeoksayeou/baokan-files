Raising Good Sweet Potato Seedlings

This year, many regions are taking the development of sweet potato crops as an important measure to realize a great leap forward in grain production. According to incomplete statistics from more than a dozen provinces, the planting area of ​​potato crops (mainly sweet potatoes) will be expanded by more than 25 million mu this year.

With the sudden expansion of sweet potato planting area, a new problem that arises is the shortage of seed potatoes. Therefore, improving the yield and quality of sweet potato seedlings is an extremely important issue.

To cultivate more and better sweet potato seedlings, in addition to selecting healthy seed potatoes, we must also vigorously improve seedling cultivation methods. In the Yangtze River, Huai River basin and parts of North China where open-field seedling cultivation is practiced, if conditions permit, it can be changed to hotbed or heated kang seedling cultivation. This not only saves seed potatoes, but also results in a high seedling yield. According to calculations in Zhongmu County, Henan Province, open-field seedling cultivation requires 4.8 million jin of seed potatoes annually for the whole county, while hotbed seedling cultivation only requires 600,000 jin of seed potatoes. Seedlings cultivated in this way can also be harvested half a month to a month earlier than those cultivated in the open field.

In areas such as Guangdong and Guangxi, where old vines are traditionally used for cuttings, tuber seedling cultivation should also be adopted to increase production, obtaining a large number of seedlings through multiple cuttings and transplanting. Ensuring the quality of sweet potato seedlings is a basic condition for increasing sweet potato production. The sturdiness of sweet potato seedlings is directly related to full and vigorous growth in the sweet potato fields; weak or diseased sweet potato seedlings often result in a large number of missing seedlings, and sometimes even widespread death.

Black rot is a devastating disease of sweet potatoes. An effective way to prevent this disease is to soak seeds in warm water and use secondary cuttings and transplanting. Both of these methods must be implemented during the seedling stage. What is the effect of soaking seeds in warm water? The experience of Changli and Ding County in Hebei Province has proved that this not only prevents disease, but also makes the seedlings strong.

In areas where summer or autumn sweet potatoes are cultivated, we should also vigorously promote the method of establishing seedling collecting fields to produce more sweet potato seedlings. Establishing seedling collecting fields involves first taking the seedlings cultivated in heated kangs or hotbeds, transplanting them densely in fertile and easily irrigated land, and then giving them meticulous field management to allow them to grow more seedlings.

Now is the sweet potato seedling season. All agricultural cooperatives should seize this first important link in increasing sweet potato production this year, learn advanced experience in this area, and cultivate more and better sweet potato seedlings.

    育好薯苗
    今年不少地区都把发展甘薯类作物作为实现粮食生产大跃进的一项重要措施。据十几个省的不完全统计，今年将扩大薯类（主要是甘薯）种植面积二千五百多万亩。
    甘薯种植面积骤然扩大，随之而来的新问题，是种薯不足。因此，提高薯苗的产量和质量是一个极其重要的问题。
    要育出更多更好的薯苗，除了选择健好的种薯外，还必须大力改进育苗方法。在长江淮河流域和华北部分露地育苗的地区，如果条件许可，可以改为温床或火炕育苗。这样作不但节约种薯，而且产苗率高。据河南中牟县计算，用露地育苗全县每年需薯种四百八十万斤，改用温床育苗有六十万斤种薯就够了。这样育的苗还可以比露地育的苗早割半个月到一个月。
    在广东、广西等习惯用老蔓扦插的地区，为了提高产量也应该改为薯块育苗，通过多次剪插，获得大量苗子。保证薯苗的质量是甘薯增产的基本条件。薯苗的健壮直接关系到薯田的苗全、苗旺；细弱或有病的薯苗，往往会造成大量缺苗，有时甚至普遍死掉。
    黑斑病是甘薯的毁灭性病害。防治这种病害的有效方法是温水浸种和二次剪插。这两种办法都必须在育苗阶段实行。温水浸种的效果如何？河北昌黎、定县的经验都证明：这样作不但能够防治病害，而且苗子健壮。
    在栽培夏甘薯或秋甘薯的地区，还要大力推广建立采苗地的方法，更多的生产薯苗。建立采苗地是：先将火炕或温床育出的苗子采下，密插在肥沃和灌溉方便的地里，然后再给予精细的田间管理，使它生长出更多的薯苗来。
    现在正是甘薯的育苗季节。各农业社都应当抓住今年增产甘薯的第一个重要环节，学习这一方面的先进经验，培育出又多又好的薯苗。
