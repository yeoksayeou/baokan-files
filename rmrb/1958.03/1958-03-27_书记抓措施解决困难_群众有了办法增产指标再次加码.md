    Secretaries Grasp Measures to Solve Difficulties
    Masses Have Ways to Increase Production, Targets Are Again Increased

    (Reported by our newspaper) In the spring plowing production, the Party committee secretaries at all levels in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, personally took action to promptly summarize and disseminate the advanced creations of the masses. This resolved many contradictions between the agricultural cooperatives' measures for increasing production and advanced targets. The broad masses now have greater confidence and enthusiasm in achieving increased production targets. The sowing work for the three major crops of early rice, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane in the entire region is being carried out earlier, faster, and better than in previous years. The sowing period for early rice and sweet potatoes has been advanced by half a month to more than a month, and the sugarcane sowing period has also been advanced significantly compared to previous years.

    This year, Neijiang Prefecture plans to increase grain production by 33%. In actual practice, various localities encountered many new problems. Some cadres and masses, unable to find effective measures for a time, felt distressed, and some even wavered in their commitment to achieving increased production targets. The Neijiang Prefectural Party Committee attached great importance to this situation. The Prefectural Party Secretary personally led the county Party secretaries from various counties to discover and summarize advanced experiences in various places and disseminate them in a timely manner, resolving many problems in production. For example, early rice planting and early sweet potato transplanting are key to increasing production throughout the region. According to previous years' production increase analysis, under the same production conditions, early sweet potato transplanting by one solar term can increase production by 30%. However, there were not many methods for early transplanting. Just as everyone was anxiously concerned about this, the Prefectural Party Secretary discovered and summarized the rapid seedling cultivation method using heated kang seedbeds created by the Fenglong Agricultural Cooperative in Weiyuan County. This method allows sweet potato seedlings to grow to three or four inches in twenty-two days, ensuring timely transplanting. After the county Party secretaries from various counties led cadres and masses to visit and study the method on-site, this experience was promoted throughout the region. Seeing that there was a way for early transplanting and certainty for increasing production, everyone was in high spirits. Many cooperative members also contributed more sweet potato seeds as investment, suggesting that the cooperative expand the sweet potato planting area and increase the amount of seeds used. The original plan to increase sweet potato production by 24% was revised to increase by 54%. The experience of the Junzi Agricultural Cooperative in Zizhong County in cultivating rice seedlings in greenhouses can make seedlings grow to three inches in just five days, and they grow very vigorously after transplanting. This experience, summarized and promoted by the Party Secretary himself, was quickly implemented in more than 20,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the region. In previous years, sowing only began in mid-March, but now many areas have already begun early rice transplanting, which provides favorable conditions for the universal planting of double-cropping rice throughout the region. Some agricultural cooperatives have also experimented with planting triple-cropping rice. The more than ten methods for rapidly sprouting early rice seeds and the experience in strengthening the management of early rice seedling fields created by Renshou County have played a significant role in helping various localities manage seedling fields and combat cold waves.

    书记抓措施解决困难
    群众有了办法增产指标再次加码
    本报讯　在春耕生产中，中共四川省内江专区各级党委书记亲自动手，及时总结和传播群众的先进创造，解决了许多农业社增产措施与先进指标不相适应的矛盾，广大群众实现增产指标的信心更足，热情更高。全区早稻、红薯、甘蔗等三大作物的播种工作都比往年进行得又早、又快、又好。早稻和红薯的播种期提前半月到一个多月，甘蔗播种期也比往年提前很多。
    今年内江专区计划增产粮食33％。在实际行动中，各地遇到了很多新难题。有些干部和群众，由于一时找不出有效措施，感到苦恼，有的甚至对实现增产指标动摇。中共内江地委对此情况极为重视，地委书记亲自带领各县县委书记到各地发掘和总结先进经验，及时传播，使生产中的许多难题迎刃而解。例如：水稻早播和红薯早栽是全区增产的关键。根据往年增产分析，在同样生产条件下，红薯早栽一个节令便可增产30％。但早栽的办法不多。正当大家为这件事焦急的时候，地委书记发现并总结了威远县奉龙农业社创造的火炕温床快速育秧法。这种办法可使薯苗在二十二天内长到三、四寸，保证及时移栽。经各县县委书记带着干部和群众实地参观学习以后，这一经验便在全区推广了。大家看到早栽有了办法，增产有了把握，情绪很高。许多社的社员还多交薯种作为投资，建议社里扩大红薯种植面积和增加用种量，原订增产红薯24％的计划也修订为增产54％。资中县君子农业社创造的温室培育稻秧的经验，只要五天便可使秧苗长到三寸，移栽后生长得很茁壮。这一经验经党委书记亲自动手总结、推广，很快就在全区两万多个农业社推行。往年3月中旬才开始播种，现在许多地区已经开始早稻栽秧，这就为全区普种双季稻提供了有利条件。部分农业社还试种了三季稻。仁寿县创造的十多种早稻快速催芽的方法以及加强早稻秧田管理的经验，对各地管理秧田和战胜寒潮都起了很大作用。
