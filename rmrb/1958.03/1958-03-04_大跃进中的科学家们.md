    The tide of the socialist Great Leap Forward is impacting the hearts of every scientist. "Dedicate my life's energy to the Party and the people, I must be both red and expert, and live up to this heroic era," is the common aspiration expressed by scientists from various research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai in recent days.

    At the anti-waste and anti-conservatism mobilization meeting of all personnel of the Institute of Physiology, Feng Depei, director of the institute, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a famous neurophysiologist, said: Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, everything must be accelerated. My own ideological remolding must also catch up quickly. I am determined to demand myself with the standards of a Party member and strive to join the Chinese Communist Party. Everyone expressed warm welcome to his request for progress, and at the same time frankly criticized his shortcomings such as arrogance, difficulty in approaching people, and insufficient acceptance of mass opinions. After everyone's criticism, Feng Depei was very moved. He said: I have never realized my shortcomings like today, and I have never felt the earnest expectations of the Party and comrades for me. I have the confidence and determination to strive to be a red expert.

    In the process of formulating and discussing personal plans, scientists believe that in order to make a Great Leap Forward in scientific research, they must criticize and self-criticize their existing bourgeois ideology and unstable political stance. Organic chemist Huang Minglong painfully examined his mistake of exaggerating the shortcomings of individual cadres as the shortcomings of general cadres during the Great Blooming and Letting in the past year, and expressed that he would resolutely correct his mistakes, completely change his position, and become a working-class intellectual. Plant physiologist Tang Yuwei examined and said that due to his arrogance and self-righteousness, he caused disunity among senior researchers in the Institute of Plant Physiology, which affected the development of research work. He said that he must transform himself thoroughly, "burn the old self, and rebuild the new self."

    On the evening of February 26, all senior researchers from various research institutes gathered to specifically discuss the personal plans of ten scientists. The personal plan of Wang You, deputy director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was considered relatively advanced and realistic. Wang You expressed his determination to completely hand over his heart to the Party and strive to join the Chinese Communist Party in the short term. He plans to spend a certain period of time each week studying political theory and the Party's guidelines and policies, and three days a week engaging in professional work, leading and personally participating in the research of antibiotics and carbohydrates, including assisting production units in solving important organic chemistry problems related to antibiotic production, vigorously cooperating with the Institute of Materia Medica, and conducting new antibiotic research, etc., to serve industrial and agricultural production and medical undertakings. Within five years, he plans to train four to five researchers and five to six assistant researchers.

    In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the Institute of Experimental Biology first decided to implement a bold reform: breaking up the original research groups, the entire research staff reorganized their forces according to four central topics: embryo cell physiology, tumors, regeneration, and silkworms, and collectively carried out research. In the past, almost every senior researcher at the Institute of Experimental Biology led a group and set up a stall according to his own expertise. This was convenient for senior researchers, but for the entire institute, the forces were scattered, there was no communication, and major academic problems could not be solved quickly and effectively. Two years ago, someone in the institute suggested that in addition to doing their own research work, each researcher should take some time to concentrate their efforts to jointly carry out research on mixed sperm hybridization of silkworms. But this proposal was not realized. In this movement, the scientists of the Institute of Experimental Biology all expressed that in order to complete important research projects more, faster, better, and more economically, they were willing to abandon their interests and original topics and resolutely obey the allocation. The tumor problem is a major problem in biology. The tumor research group of the Institute of Experimental Biology was only led by Yao Xin, a senior researcher, and Yao Xin's interest was in histochemistry, so the research work progressed slowly in five years. In this upsurge, two senior researchers, experimental biologists Lu Jiahong and Chen Ruiming, both expressed their support for tumor research. Everyone believed that Yao Xin had a foundation in tumor research, Lu Jiahong had experience in the biochemistry of nucleic acids, and Chen Ruiming was good at tissue culture. These three scientists cooperated closely and advanced on separate routes, and it was very promising to break through the tumor fortress. Yao Xin was very excited when he heard this news while ill. He wrote a big-character poster to examine his past attitude of half-belief and half-doubt towards the Party. He expressed full confidence and strived to achieve results within five years and catch up with the international level within ten years.

    Wang Zhongliang, director and Party secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, set a personal plan to continuously familiarize himself with his work and improve his policy level within five years. Wang Zhongliang decided to choose the Institute of Plant Physiology as his "experimental field" for learning and familiarizing himself with his work, and spend one day a week going down to the "experimental field." In addition to having a relatively comprehensive understanding of the general situation and professional knowledge of the institute, he also had to go deep into a research group, learn the knowledge of this discipline, participate in some work, and be an intern. Wang Zhongliang also plans to continue his studies based on his existing Japanese skills.

    Yang Jin, deputy Party secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also made a personal plan to make fifteen to twenty scientific workers in biology, medicine, history, and other fields as good teachers and helpful friends, to have close contact in life, and to consult academic problems at any time. In addition to studying political theory, Yang Jin also plans to squeeze out twelve hours a week to tutor English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry within five years.

    The ideological Great Leap Forward of Shanghai scientists heralds the imminent arrival of a Great Leap Forward in scientific research to catch up with the international level. (This newspaper's special Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    大跃进中的科学家们
    新华社记者　余辉音
    社会主义大跃进的浪潮冲击着每一个科学家的心，“把毕生精力献给党和人民，一定要红透专深，无负英雄的时代”，这是最近几天中国科学院在上海的各研究单位科学家们表示的共同愿望。
    在生理研究所全体人员反浪费反保守动员大会上，这个研究所所长、中国科学院学部委员、著名神经生理学家冯德培说：在大跃进的形势下，一切事情都要快马加鞭，我个人的思想改造也要急起直追，我决心以党员标准要求自己，争取参加中国共产党。大家对他的进步要求表示了热诚的欢迎，同时对他的自高自大、不易接近人和接受群众意见不够等缺点提出了坦率的批评。冯德培经过大家的批评，很受感动。他说：我从来没有像今天这样认识到自己的缺点，没有这样体会到党和同志们对我期望的殷切。我有信心和决心争取做一个红色专家。
    在制订和讨论个人规划的过程中，科学家们认为要在科学研究方面大跃进，必须对自己存在的资产阶级思想作风和政治立场不稳，开展批评和自我批评。有机化学家黄鸣龙沉痛地检查了他在去年大鸣大放时期把个别干部的缺点夸大为一般干部缺点的错误，表示要痛改前非，彻底转变立场，做工人阶级知识分子。植物生理学家汤玉玮检查说，由于他自高自大、自以为是，造成了植物生理研究所内高级研究人员之间的不团结，影响了研究工作的开展。他表示一定要脱胎换骨地改造自己，要“烧毁旧我，重建新我”。
    2月26日晚上，各研究所的全体高级研究人员集会，专门讨论了十位科学家的个人规划。有机化学研究所副所长、中国科学院学部委员汪猷的个人规划被认为是比较先进和切合实际的。汪猷表示决心把自己的心完全交给党，争取在短期内参加中国共产党。他计划每周有一定时期学习政治理论和党的方针政策，每周有三天时间从事业务工作，领导和亲自参加抗生素、碳水化合物的研究工作，包括协助生产单位解决抗生素生产中有关有机化学的重要问题，大力和药物研究所合作，进行新抗生素研究等，为工农业生产和医药事业服务。五年内，他打算培养出研究员四至五人；助理研究员五至六人。
    在反浪费反保守运动中，实验生物研究所首先决定实行一项大胆的改革：打乱原来的研究工作组，全所研究人员按胚胎细胞生理、肿瘤、再生和蚕等四个中心题目重新组织力量，集体进行研究。过去实验生物所差不多每个高级研究人员都领导一个组，按自己的专长设一个摊子。这样，对高级研究人员来说是方便的，但就全所来说，力量分散，互不通气，不能迅速有效地解决重大的学术问题。两年前研究所曾经有人建议研究人员除搞好自己的研究工作外，每人抽一点时间集中力量共同搞好蚕的混精杂交的研究。但是这个建议没有实现。在这次运动中，实验生物研究所的科学家们都表示为了多、快、好、省地完成重要的研究项目，他们愿意放弃自己的兴趣和原来的题目，坚决服从分配。肿瘤问题是生物学上的重大问题，实验生物研究所肿瘤研究小组只有一个高级研究人员姚鑫领导，而姚鑫的兴趣又在组织化学方面，所以五年内研究工作进展缓慢。在这次高潮中，研究所有两个高级研究人员、实验生物学家吕家鸿和陈瑞铭都表示支援肿瘤的研究工作，大家认为姚鑫对肿瘤的研究有基础，吕家鸿研究核酸的生物化学有经验，陈瑞铭擅长组织培养，这三位科学家通力合作，分路进军，攻破肿瘤堡垒是大有希望的。姚鑫在病中听到这个消息非常兴奋，他写了大字报检讨自己过去对党的半信半疑的态度，他表示信心百倍，争取在五年内作出成绩，十年内赶上国际水平。
    科学院上海办事处主任、党委书记王仲良订的个人规划，要五年内不断熟悉业务和提高政策水平。王仲良决定选择植物生理研究所作为他学习和熟悉业务的“试验田”，每周有一天时间下“试验田”，除了比较全面地了解这个研究所的一般情况和业务知识外，还要深入一个研究组，学习这一学科的知识，参加部分工作，做见习员。王仲良还打算在原有日文基础上继续学习。
    科学院上海办事处党委副书记杨进也订出了个人规划，要在生物、药物、历史等三方面拜十五到二十个科学工作者做良师益友，做到生活上密切接触，学术问题随时请教。除学习政治理论外，杨进还打算五年内每周挤出十二小时补习英文、数学、物理和化学。
    上海科学家们思想上的大跃进，预示着科学研究上赶上国际水平的大跃进即将来临。　　（本报特约新华社专稿）
