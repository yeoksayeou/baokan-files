    Tianmen Masses Invest in Building Fertilizer Plant
    Every Farmer Pays, Every Mu of Farmland Benefits
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 18th dispatch) The masses of Tianmen County, Hubei Province, are enthusiastically investing in the construction of a fertilizer plant. This fertilizer plant, with an annual output of 21,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, is under intense preparation and will be put into production this year.
    This is the first factory in Hubei Province to be built with investment from the masses. After the plant is completed, the 2.2 million mu of cultivated land in Tianmen County will receive an average of 20 jin of fertilizer per mu. Grain and cotton production, as well as farmers' incomes, will greatly increase.
    After the news of Tianmen County's plan to build a fertilizer plant spread, the broad masses of the county were very excited. The 417 households of the Xin'cun (New Village) Cooperative in Qianjin Township wrote a letter of determination to the County Party Committee, expressing that they would provide both manpower and money to strongly support the construction of the fertilizer plant. The entire cooperative decided to contribute 20,000 yuan for investment first. Xinqiao Township decided to invest 280,000 yuan this year, and will first contribute 120,000 yuan. Sixteen Party members from the County People's Bank are willing to invest more than 700 yuan. Party and government, finance and trade, culture and education, and industrial departments can invest a total of more than 1 million yuan. Based on the enthusiastic investment from the people of the county, the 5 million yuan of funds needed for the construction of the factory can be greatly exceeded.

    天门群众投资建设化肥工厂
    个个农民出钱  亩亩农田得利
    本报武汉18日电　湖北省天门县群众踊跃投资兴建化肥厂。这个年产二万一千吨硫酸铵的化肥厂，正紧张筹备，今年内可以投入生产。
    这是湖北省第一个由群众投资兴办的工厂。这个厂建成以后，天门县二百二十万亩耕地平均每亩可以得到二十斤化肥。粮、棉产量和农民收入将大大增加。
    天门县举办化肥厂的消息传出以后，全县广大人民十分兴奋。前进乡新农村社四百一十七户社员一块向县委写决心书，表示要人有人，要钱有钱，大力支援兴办化肥厂。全社决定先拿出两万元投资。新桥乡决定今年投资二十八万元，并先拿出十二万元。县人民银行有十六个党员愿意拿出七百多元投资，党政、财经、文教、工业等部门共可投资一百多万元。根据全县人民踊跃投资的情况看，这个厂建厂需要的五百万元资金可以大大超过。
