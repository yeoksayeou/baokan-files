Science Enters Cotton Fields to Serve Production
Northwest Agricultural Science Departments and Qian County Sign Contract to Increase Cotton Production

(Our report) The Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, in order to strengthen scientific research and increase cotton production, recently signed a cooperation contract with the Qian County People's Committee of Shaanxi Province. The Qian County People's Committee (Party A) and the Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station (Party B) will cooperate to strive to exceed the target of 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu in Qian County, and to cultivate four townships producing 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu: Zhoucheng, Chengguan, Yanghong, and Changliu.

The cooperation contract stipulates that the obligations undertaken by the Qian County People's Committee are: 1. Ensure the implementation of the specified technical measures for increasing cotton production, especially the key technologies of seedling protection, close planting, and pest control; 2. Regularly provide Party B with various materials related to agricultural production in Qian County (plans, reports, statistics, summaries, etc.) to facilitate Party B's research; 3. Provide the land needed for experimental research and possible solutions, in preparation for continuously improving high-yield technology; 4. Be responsible for leading the political and ideological education and labor training of Party B's cadres.

The cooperation contract stipulates that the obligations undertaken by the Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station are: 1. Be responsible for formulating practical and feasible technical measures for increasing cotton production, and after discussion and approval by Party A, be responsible for technical training (training township and commune-level cadres by township, and imparting production technology at relevant production meetings in the county) and assisting in checking production work, and promptly making suggestions for improvement; 2. Be responsible for helping relevant county-level cadres of Party A to manage cotton experimental fields; 3. Give priority to providing Party A with proven improved varieties, advanced experience, and scientific research results for trial use, and be responsible for imparting usage techniques; 4. Focusing on four townships including Zhoucheng, and taking the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative as an experimental point, organize cadres to study yield-increasing technologies such as close planting, pest control, topdressing with chemical fertilizers, and green manure before cotton planting, and be responsible for compensating for the reduced yield of the experimental land based on the general yield per mu of the cooperative.
