Bi-Weekly International Review
(February 17th – March 3rd)

	In the past two weeks, the struggle to ease international tensions has made new progress. The Chinese People's Volunteers decided to withdraw from Korea in batches within 1958. Poland suggested that relevant countries begin establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The issue of holding a high-level meeting between Eastern and Western countries has also entered the stage of how the major powers will prepare for the meeting. However, the Western countries, led by the United States, after having to agree to hold a high-level meeting, continue to delay the time for the high-level meeting, actively engage in nuclear armament, and intensify the suppression and destruction of national liberation movements in Asia and Africa. Tense and complex struggles have emerged in North Africa, the Middle East, and Indonesia.

Socialist Countries are Confident in Eliminating the Threat of War

	The two declarations issued by the Moscow Conference of Communist Parties in November 1957 presented a common goal of struggle to the people of the world: to prevent war and achieve peaceful coexistence. After that, the countries of the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, were full of confidence and actively and firmly implemented the policy of easing international tensions. The Soviet Union proposed to the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and relevant countries that the East and West should resolve disputes through peaceful negotiations and stop the "Cold War." After several exchanges of letters between the governments of various countries, the peace proposals of the socialist countries were shown to the world, and the die-hard policy of the Western countries, led by the United States, to continue to adhere to the "Cold War" and create tense situations was exposed, thereby uniting all peace-loving people in the world around the slogans of immediately stopping nuclear weapons testing, holding high-level meetings between Eastern and Western countries, reducing armaments, and stopping the "Cold War," forming an irresistible tide of peace. Recently, the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to completely withdraw from Korea, and Poland's further proposal to establish a specific nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, are all efforts by socialist countries to promote peace in all aspects. Everyone knows that the Korean issue and the rearmament of West Germany are two issues with the danger of war in the current international situation. The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the easing of tensions in Central Europe will be conducive to promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean and German issues.

	The decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea is an action of the Chinese government and people to actively support the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Only when all foreign troops withdraw from Korea can it be guaranteed that the Korean issue will be resolved by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference. The decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea shows that the Chinese and North Korean sides are deeply confident in their own strength. In the past, we have already defeated the American aggressors. Now, our strength is even greater. If the United States dares to take risks, it will inevitably suffer even greater defeat. The imperialists will also see that the forces of peace-loving people all over the world have now become so powerful that if they provoke war, they will perish themselves. The decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea has not only been supported by all socialist countries and warmly welcomed by Asian countries, but also valued by Western public opinion. Agence France-Presse said that this was an event that caused a sensation in Washington. Western public opinion cannot but admit the peace wishes of the Chinese and North Korean sides, and believes that the withdrawal of the volunteers from Korea is a bold action to realize this wish. World opinion generally requires the United States to take the same action. The Indian Urdu "Glory News" published our country's statement on February 20 with the headline "This is a Moment to Test the United States and Other Countries," and the "Hindustan Daily" believed that "the other party should take the same steps." Japan's "Asahi Shimbun," "Mainichi Shimbun," "Sankei Jiji," and "Tokyo Shimbun" all published articles saying that this has marked a new stage in resolving the Korean issue, requiring the "United Nations Army" to take measures to respond to the decisions of China and North Korea.

	Similarly, the Polish government's proposal also fully demonstrates that socialist countries do not want to scare people with atomic weapons; they are willing to live a peaceful life free from the threat of atomic war, just like the countries in Central Europe. If West Germany is not trying to continue on the path of militarism, then there is no reason to reject this proposal that is beneficial to the German people and the European people. Therefore, the Polish proposal has won widespread support from the people of Western Europe. Officials from countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden also believe that this plan is worth studying and discussing.

	Undoubtedly, the efforts of socialist countries to promote the easing of the international situation in many ways have given new encouragement to the struggle of the people all over the world to win peace.

Forcing the United States to Change its Die-Hard Policy and Hold High-Level Meetings as Soon as Possible

	At present, regarding the need to hold high-level meetings between Eastern and Western countries to resolve major international issues and ease tensions, no one, including Dulles, dares to publicly oppose it anymore. The process has reached the point of how to promote the convening of high-level meetings as soon as possible. Since the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Menshikov, he has had many conversations with Eisenhower, Nixon, and Dulles. Recently, the Soviet government sent a memorandum to the US government on the issue of preparing for high-level meetings. Obviously, the Soviet government is making new efforts to promote high-level meetings. However, people cannot but pay close attention to the attitude of the United States.

	On February 17, in response to Bulganin's letter of February 1, Eisenhower proposed the hope of consulting on the issue of high-level meetings "through less formal and less publicly publicized contacts." If the United States is sincere in holding a meeting, any method of consultation is acceptable. However, judging from the United States' current actual actions, one cannot help but suspect that the United States' proposal of this request is only to delay the time for the high-level meeting.

	Regarding the issue of preparing for high-level meetings, the delaying tactic adopted by the United States is to discuss the substantive issues of high-level meetings at the preparatory meeting. Even among the major countries of the North Atlantic Group, not all of them support the United States on this point. France has clearly stated that the foreign ministers' meeting is only to discuss procedural issues of the meeting. The United States' insistence on discussing substantive issues at the foreign ministers' meeting is obviously to use this topic to delay the time in order to gain time to force its allies to agree to the establishment of missile bases. The United States and the United Kingdom have signed an agreement to establish medium-range missile bases. France and the Netherlands have expressed their acceptance of the United States' request to establish missile bases. The United States is transporting atomic weapons to overseas bases and using them to equip West Germany and South Korean troops. Not only that, but US State Department spokesman White, Dulles, and the US representative to the Korean Armistice Commission have successively stated that they will not consider the issue of withdrawing US troops from South Korea. The proposal of Poland to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is also considered the most dangerous plan for US security and is rejected. Obviously, these actions by the United States run counter to the spirit of easing international tensions and preparing for high-level meetings. This rigid attitude of the United States is not only opposed by all peace-loving people, but even another part of the US ruling group believes that it is detrimental to the United States. Former US presidential disarmament adviser Stassen, after resigning, criticized the views held by Eisenhower and Dulles on the issue of convening high-level meetings and disarmament, believing that an agreement could be reached on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing at the high-level meeting.

	The people of the world must continue to persevere in their efforts to force the United States to change its rigid attitude and abandon its "Cold War" policy and its plan to obstruct high-level meetings.

	The Struggle of the People of Asia and Africa Against Imperialism

	In the past half month, the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against imperialism has been very tense. In North Africa, the Algerian National Liberation Army has launched continuous attacks and has continued to achieve new victories. According to French military official materials, more than 300 French troops were killed and wounded in the first two months of this year. The Tunisian people protested against the French aircraft bombing a village on the border between Algeria and Tunisia, and launched a struggle demanding the withdrawal of French troops from Tunisia. In the Middle East and Near East, the establishment of the United Arab Republic aroused a new upsurge in the nationalist sentiments of the people of Arab countries. The people of Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq all warmly supported the strengthening of unity among Arab nations, opposed the Baghdad Pact, and opposed the Eisenhower Doctrine. Yemen has announced its decision to join the United Arab Republic on a federal basis. In the Aden and Oman regions, the British aggressor troops have also encountered resolute resistance. In Southeast Asia, the Indonesian people are waging a resolute struggle against the rebel groups colluding with imperialism in order to safeguard the independence and unity of the country.

	In order to maintain its colonial interests, imperialism is currently focusing its aggressive edge on the Middle East and Near East and Indonesia.

	In the Middle East and Near East, imperialism created the Federation of Iraq and Jordan to resist the influence of the anti-imperialist and actively neutral policy of the United Arab Republic. At the same time, imperialism used the border issue between Sudan and Egypt to wantonly provoke the relationship between Sudan and the United Arab Republic, once creating a tense situation on the border between the two countries. The United States is also attempting to threaten the Arab Republic through its control of North Africa. The United States is using pro-Western forces in Tunisia to squeeze out France and then gain control of the entire North Africa. However, all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism cannot deceive the Arab people. The flames that have already been ignited by the two major desires of the Arab people for liberation and strengthening unity cannot be extinguished.

	In Indonesia, imperialism is openly carrying out the arrogant plan to overthrow the Indonesian government.

	Since the Indonesian people resolutely launched the movement to recover West Irian, in the arduous struggle against domestic reactionary forces and foreign imperialism, the people's awareness has been raised and their unity has been strengthened. The three major political parties, the Nationalist Party, the Islamic Teachers' Union, and the Communist Party, firmly support the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Djuanda. This has made it impossible for the domestic reactionary forces to succeed in sabotaging the recovery of West Irian and secessionist activities. President Sukarno's visit abroad has further obtained the support of Asian and African countries for Indonesia's struggle against Dutch imperialism. This has frightened the domestic reactionary forces and imperialism, so they attempted to take advantage of President Sukarno's absence to carry out a rebellion and overthrow the Indonesian government. When the rebels were planning to establish a "revolutionary government" in Central Sumatra, the US Secretary of State openly issued a statement interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, attacking President Sukarno and the Indonesian government. The imperialists' aggressive ambitions towards Indonesia have been fully exposed.

	However, imperialism always underestimates the power of the people. The emergence of the rebel "government" in Central Sumatra has indeed increased the difficulties in the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist struggle, but the people have also learned a lesson from this incident and have further seen through the true colors of the domestic reactionary forces. Therefore, the national political parties, the army, and the broad masses of the people firmly support the government in taking resolute suppression measures against the rebel groups. The Indonesian Parliament passed a vote of confidence in the Djuanda Cabinet on the evening of February 28, expressing its approval of the policies adopted by the Djuanda government in the struggle to win the liberation of West Irian, once again proving the strengthening of national unity under the leadership of President Sukarno. The Indonesian people will overcome all difficulties and win the victory of the struggle.

    半月国际述评
    （2月17日——3月3日）
    两周以来，缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，有了新的进展。中国人民志愿军决定在1958年内分批撤出朝鲜。波兰建议有关国家着手建立中欧无原子武器地区。关于举行东西方国家之间的高级会议问题，也已进入大国之间究竟怎么为会议作准备的阶段。而以美国为首的西方国家，在不得不同意召开高级会议之后，却继续在高级会议问题上拖延时间，积极进行核备战，并且加紧了对亚非地区民族解放运动的镇压和破坏。在北非、中东和印度尼西亚都出现了紧张复杂的斗争。
    社会主义国家充满信心消除战争威胁
    1957年11月各国共产党的莫斯科会议发表的两大宣言，向全世界人民提出了共同的奋斗目标：防止战争，实现和平共处。在这之后，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，充满信心，积极地、坚定地执行着缓和国际紧张局势的方针。苏联向北大西洋公约组织各国和有关国家政府的首脑，提出了东西方应当通过和平谈判，解决争端，停止“冷战”的建议。经过各国政府之间几次互相交换信件，向全世界表明了社会主义国家的和平主张，也暴露了以美国为首的西方国家继续坚持“冷战”，制造紧张局势的死硬政策，从而把全世界一切爱好和平的人民，团结在立即停止试验核武器、召开东西方国家的高级会议、裁减军备、停止
  “冷战”的口号周围，形成不可抗拒的和平潮流。最近，中国人民志愿军决定全部撤出朝鲜，波兰也进一步提出建立中欧无原子武器地区的具体建议，都是社会主义国家从各方面来致力于促进和平。谁都知道，朝鲜问题和重新武装西德问题，是当前国际上两个具有战争危险的问题。从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，以及缓和中欧的紧张局势，都将有利于促使朝鲜和德国问题的和平解决。
    中国人民志愿军决定撤出朝鲜，是中国政府和人民积极支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出的和平统一朝鲜建议的行动。只有一切外国军队撤出了朝鲜，才能保证朝鲜问题在不受外国的干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己求得解决。中国人民志愿军决定撤出朝鲜，表明了中朝方面深信自己的力量。过去，我们已经打败过美国侵略者，现在，我们的力量更强大了，如果美国敢于冒险，必将遭到更大的失败。帝国主义者也不会不看到，全世界爱好和平的力量，现在已经强大到这样的地步，如果它们挑动战争，就会自取灭亡。中国人民志愿军决定撤出朝鲜的这一行动，不仅得到了一切社会主义国家的支持，为亚洲各国所热烈欢迎，并且为西方舆论所重视。法新社说，这是在华盛顿引起轰动的事件。西方的舆论不能不承认朝中方面的和平愿望，认为志愿军的撤离朝鲜是实现这一愿望的大胆行动。世界舆论普遍要求美国采取同样的行动。印度乌尔都文“荣耀报”2月20日发表我国声明的时候，标题是“这是考验美国和其他国家的时刻”，“印度斯坦日报”认为“另一方应采取同样步骤。”日本的“朝日新闻”、“每日新闻”、“产经时事报”、“东京新闻”都发表文章说，这为朝鲜解决问题划了一个新阶段，要求“联合国军”采取措施，呼应中朝决定。
    同样的，波兰政府的建议，也充分表现了社会主义国家是不想靠原子武器来吓人的；愿意同中欧地区的国家，同样能够过着不受原子战争威胁的安宁日子。如果西德不是企图继续在军国主义的道路上前进，也就没有理由拒绝这一个有利于德国人民和欧洲人民的建议。因之波兰的建议赢得了西欧人民广泛的支持。英国、挪威、瑞典等国的官方，也都认为这个计划值得研究和讨论。
    无疑的，社会主义国家多方促进缓和国际局势的努力，给予全世界人民争取和平的斗争以新的鼓舞。
    迫使美国改变死硬政策，早日举行高级会议
    目前，对于需要召开东西方之间的高级会议，解决国际上的重大问题，缓和紧张局势，已经再没有人，包括杜勒斯在内，敢于公开反对了。事情的进程到了怎样早日促成高级会议的召开。自从苏联新任驻美大使缅希科夫到任以后，同艾森豪威尔、尼克松、杜勒斯有过多次交谈。最近苏联政府又送给美国政府关于准备高级会议问题的备忘录。显而易见的，苏联政府正在为促进高级会议，进行新的努力。可是，人们不能不密切注意美国的态度。
    2月17日，艾森豪威尔在答复布尔加宁2月1日的信件上，提出希望“通过不那么正式、不那么公开宣扬的接触”来磋商高级会议的问题。如果，美国真有诚意于举行会议，采取什么方式进行磋商，本来都是可以的。但是就美国的目前实际行动来看，不能不令人怀疑美国提出这一要求，只是为了拖延高级会议的时日。
    在为高级会议作准备问题上，美国所采取的拖延手法，就是要在准备会议上讨论高级会议的实质问题。这一点，甚至在北大西洋集团主要国家之间，并不都是支持美国的。法国就明确提出过，外长会议只是讨论会议程序问题。美国所以坚持在外长会议上讨论实质问题，明显地是借此题目，纠缠时日，以便取得时间，来强迫它的盟国同意建立导弹基地。美英两国已经签订了建立中程导弹基地的协定，法国和荷兰表示接受美国建立导弹基地的要求，美国正把原子武器运到海外基地，并用以装备西德、南朝鲜军队。不仅如此，美国国务院发言人怀特和杜勒斯以及朝鲜停战委员会的美方代表，先后表示，将不考虑从南朝鲜撤出美国军队问题。对于波兰建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议，也认为是对美国安全最危险的计划，加以拒绝。显然的，美国这些行动，是同缓和国际紧张局势，准备召开高级会议的精神背道而驰的。美国这种僵硬的态度，不但遭到一切爱好和平的人民的反对，就是美国统治集团中的另一部分人，也认为是对美国不利的。美国总统前裁军顾问史塔生在辞职以后，就指责了在召开高级会议和裁军问题上艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯所持的见解，认为高级会议上就停止试验核武器问题是可能达成协议的。
    全世界人民要继续坚持努力，迫使美国改变僵硬的态度，放弃“冷战”政策和阻挠高级会议的打算。
        亚非地区反对帝国主义的斗争
    亚非人民反对帝国主义的斗争，半个月来，是十分紧张的。北非方面，阿尔及利亚民族解放军连续出击，不断获得新的胜利。据法军官方材料，今年头两个月里，法军被击毙击伤三百多人。突尼斯人民抗议法国飞机轰炸阿尔及利亚和突尼斯边境一个村庄，掀起了要求法军撤出突尼斯的斗争。中近东方面，阿拉伯联合共和国成立激起了阿拉伯各国人民民族主义情绪的新的高涨，黎巴嫩、约旦、伊拉克人民，都热烈拥护阿拉伯民族加强团结，反对巴格达条约，反对艾森豪威尔主义。也门已宣布，决定在联邦基础上，参加阿拉伯联合共和国。在亚丁和阿曼地区，英国侵略军，也遭到坚决的反抗。在东南亚，印度尼西亚人民正在为维护国家的独立和统一，同勾结帝国主义的叛乱集团展开坚决的斗争。
    帝国主义为了维护它的殖民利益，目前把它的侵略锋芒，集中在中近东和印度尼西亚。
    在中近东方面，帝国主义制造了伊拉克和约旦的联邦，抵制阿拉伯联合共和国反对帝国主义、积极中立的政策的影响。同时，帝国主义利用了苏丹和埃及的边界问题，大肆挑拨苏丹和阿拉伯联合共和国的关系，一度造成两国边界的紧张局势。美国还企图通过对北非的控制，威胁阿拉伯共和国。美国正在利用突尼斯亲西方的势力，把法国挤走，进而取得对整个北非的控制。可是，帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，是骗不了阿拉伯人民的。阿拉伯人民要求解放和加强团结的两大愿望所已经燃烧起来的烈焰，是扑灭不了的。
    在印度尼西亚方面，帝国主义公开执行着推翻印度尼西亚政府的狂妄计划。
    自从印度尼西亚人民坚决开展收复西伊里安的运动以来，在同国内反动势力、国外帝国主义的艰巨斗争中，人民觉悟提高了，团结加强了。国民党、伊斯兰教师联合会和共产党等三大政党，坚决支持以朱安达总理为首的内阁。这就使得国内反动势力破坏收复西伊里安和分裂活动，不能得逞。苏加诺总统的出国访问，更进一步取得了亚非各国对于印度尼西亚反对荷兰帝国主义斗争的支持。这就使得国内的反动势力和帝国主义着慌起来，于是，企图乘苏加诺总统出国期间，实行叛乱，推翻印度尼西亚政府。当叛乱分子正在中苏门答腊策划成立“革命政府”的时候，美国国务卿公然发表了干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话，攻击苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府。帝国主义对印度尼西亚的侵略野心，暴露无遗了。
    但是，帝国主义对于人民的力量永远是估计不足的。中苏门答腊叛乱“政府”的出现，固然增加了印度尼西亚人民反帝斗争中的困难，但是，人民也正是从这一事件中得到了教训，进一步识破了国内反动势力的真面目。因之，全国的政党、军队和广大人民，坚决支持政府对叛乱集团采取了坚决的镇压措施。印度尼西亚国会，在2月28日晚上，通过对朱安达内阁的信任案，表示批准朱安达政府在争取解放西伊里安斗争中所采取的政策，又一次证明了全国人民在苏加诺总统领导下团结的加强。印度尼西亚人民必将克服一切困难，取得斗争的胜利。
