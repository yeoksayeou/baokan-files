Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd. The Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Moldvinov on March 17th, entitled "Growing Difficulties in the Economy and Foreign Trade of Western Europe."

The author points out that since the second half of last year, the situation in the capitalist world's commodity market has generally deteriorated. This is particularly evident in the decline in raw material sales, increased inventories, the drop in prices of most raw materials and grains, and the reduction in shipping and railway transportation costs. This inevitably reduces the import possibilities of countries exporting raw materials and grains, while at the same time creating export difficulties for industrialized countries in the world, especially Western European industrial nations, resulting in an overall decline in international trade in the capitalist world.

The author says that the report on the economic situation of Western European countries in the first nine months of 1957, published by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, shows that during this period, investment in Western European countries has decreased, and the sales of industrial equipment are shrinking, both domestically and in foreign markets. When discussing the prospects for economic development in Western European countries, the report points out that the decline in industrial production in these countries is occurring simultaneously with the following situations: First, some countries with limited foreign exchange reserves are encountering serious difficulties in their balance of payments; second, the American economy is in recession; and third, prices are falling in the raw materials market. The report believes that this situation is clearly different from the situation in 1953 and 1954, when the American economy also experienced a recession, but the adverse effects on other countries, especially Western European countries, were not as severe.

The author says that an analysis of recently published official statistics can prove that in 1957, a series of abnormal trends appeared in the foreign trade of most Western European countries, which are primarily manifested in the increase in trade deficits and the deterioration of the foreign exchange situation in many Western European countries.

For example, Britain's trade deficit in 1957 increased to 618 million pounds, an increase of 9% compared with 1956. Britain's foreign debt, mainly debts owed for importing raw materials and other commodities from colonies and dominions, has reached a huge 3.5 billion pounds, while gold and dollar reserves are only 780 million pounds, about 25% lower than the level in 1951.

France's foreign trade also frequently shows deficits. Last year, the trade deficit reached 492.5 billion francs, an increase of 19% compared with 1956. France's gold and dollar reserves have virtually been depleted.

Italy's trade deficit in 1957 was 678.9 billion lire, an increase of 5.6% compared with 1956.

Belgium's trade deficit in the first nine months of 1956 was 1 billion Belgian francs, while in the first nine months of 1957 it rose to 9.6 billion Belgian francs.

Austria's trade deficit last year reached 3.9 billion schillings, 20% higher than in 1956. Switzerland's foreign trade deficit increased by 17% in 1957. Many other Western European countries, including the Scandinavian countries, have seen an increase in their trade deficits.

The author points out that the policy of accelerating economic militarization is an important factor in the deterioration of the trade balance of many Western European countries. In addition, the adverse consequences of the United States' foreign economic policy also deepened sharply in 1957. According to US customs statistics, US exports to eight Western European countries (Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden) in the first nine months of 1957 increased by 26% compared with the same period in 1956, while US imports from these countries increased by only 9% during the same period. British customs statistics show that Britain's imports from the United States increased by 18.4% in 1957, but Britain's exports to the United States remained at the same level as in the past.

The growth figures for imports from the United States by the seventeen Western European member states of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation are also very illustrative. According to the statistical bulletin of this organization, the total imports of the above-mentioned countries from the United States increased by 22% in nine months of 1957, while the total exports of these countries to the United States did not increase during the same period.

The extreme development of West Germany's economic expansion is also a reason for the sharpening of the situation in the world capitalist market. West Germany's exports in 1957 were 36 billion West German marks, an increase of 16% compared with the 1956 level. This situation was largely achieved at the expense of the interests of other Western European countries. The above-mentioned factors unfavorable to Western European foreign trade have forced Western European countries to stop the practice of lowering customs duties and import quotas adopted in the first half of 1957, and re-adopt policies to strengthen import restrictions.

The attempt to establish regional economic groups and alliances is a characteristic of the trade policy of Western European countries in 1957. In this regard, the plan to establish a "Common Market" for the six Western European countries is particularly noteworthy. However, due to various contradictions between the member states of this plan, the trend of the plan being undermined is inevitable.

The author points out that in the context of shrinking markets, intensified competition, and a general deterioration in the capitalist economic market, Western European countries have had to change their trade policies towards socialist countries to some extent. For example, many Western European countries have lifted the trade embargo against the People's Republic of China, which was passed under pressure from the United States in 1951. At the same time, the proposition of developing trade with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is also deeply rooted in the hearts of the people in Western Europe.

### 资本主义世界一片萧条  西欧经济萎缩出口下降  经济军事化和美国损人利己政策是重要因素

    资本主义世界一片萧条
    西欧经济萎缩出口下降
    经济军事化和美国损人利己政策是重要因素
    新华社22日讯　苏联“真理报”3月17日刊载了莫尔德维诺夫的一篇文章，题目是“西欧的经济和对外贸易上的困难在增长”。
    作者指出，自从去年下半年以来，资本主义世界商品市场的情况普遍恶化，这特别明显地表现在原料销路下降、存货增加、大部分原料和粮食价格下跌、海运和铁路运输费用的降低等等。这就不可避免地使那些输出原料和粮食的国家的进口可能性降低了，同时又使世界上工业发达的国家、特别是西欧工业国在出口上发生困难，造成了资本主义世界国际贸易的全面下降。
    作者说，联合国欧洲经济委员会发表的关于西欧国家1957年头九个月的经济概况报告表明，在这个期间，西欧国家的投资已经减少，无论是西欧国家国内或是在国外市场上，工业设备的销路正在萎缩。这个报告在谈到西欧国家经济发展前途时指出，这些国家的工业生产的下降是同下列情况同时发生的：第一，一些外汇储备很有限的国家在收支平衡上碰到严重困难；第二，美国经济发生衰退；第三，原料市场上价格跌落。报告认为，这种情况显然不同于1953年和1954年的情况，那时美国的经济也发生衰退，但是对其他国家、首先是西欧国家的经济的不良影响并不厉害。
    作者说，分析一下最近公布的官方统计材料就可以证明，1957年在大多数西欧国家的对外贸易中出现一系列不正常的趋势，这首先表
  现在贸易逆差增加以及许多西欧国家外汇状况恶化。
    例如，英国1957年的贸易逆差增加到六亿一千八百万英镑，比1956年增加了9％。英国的外债，主要是从殖民地和自治领输入原料和其他商品所欠下的债款，已达三十五亿英镑之巨，而黄金和美元储备却只有七亿八千万英镑，比1951年的水平约低25％。
    法国对外贸易也经常出现赤字。去年贸易逆差达四千九百二十五亿法郎，比1956年增加了19％。法国的黄金和美元储备实际上已经枯竭。
    意大利1957年的贸易逆差是六千七百八十九亿里拉，比1956年增加了5.6％。
    比利时的贸易逆差在1956年头九个月是十亿比利时法郎，而在1957年头九个月上升到了九十六亿比利时法郎。
    奥地利去年贸易逆差达三十九亿先令，比1956年高20％。瑞士1957年对外贸易逆差增加了17％。其他许多西欧国家，包括斯堪的纳维亚各国在内，贸易逆差都有增加。
    作者指出，加速经济军事化的政策是使许多西欧国家贸易差额恶化的重要因素。此外，美国对外经济政策的不良后果在1957年也急剧加深。根据美国海关统计数字，美国在1957年头九个月对西欧八个国家（英国、西德、法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时、瑞士、瑞典）的出口额比1956年同时期增加了26％，而在同一时期美国从这些国家的进口额却只增加9％。英国海关统计资料表明，英国在1957年从美国的进口额增加了18.4％，但英国对美国的出口额却仍旧保持着过去的水平。
    欧洲经济合作组织的十七个西欧成员国从美国进口额的增长数字也很可以说明问题。据这一组织的统计公报估计，1957年九个月内上述国家从美国的进口总额增长了22％，而同一期间这些国家对美国的输出总额却没有增加。
    西德经济扩张的极度发展也是世界资本主义市场情况尖锐化的原因。1957年西德出口额为三百六十亿西德马克，比1956年水平增加了16％。这种情况在很大程度上是靠着牺牲西欧其他国家的利益而达到的。上面列举的不利于西欧对外贸易的因素使西欧各国不得不停止1957年上半年采取的降低海关税额和入口限额的做法，而重新采取加强进口限制的政策。
    建立区域性经济集团和联盟的尝试是1957年西欧国家贸易政策的特征。在这方面，特别值得注意的是建立西欧六国“共同市场”的计划。但是由于这个计划的成员国之间发生了种种矛盾，计划遭到破坏的趋势是不可避免的。
    作者指出，西欧各国在市场缩小、竞争尖锐化和资本主义经济市场情况普遍恶化的情况下，不得不在某种程度上改变它们对社会主义阵营国家的贸易政策。例如许多西欧国家取消了1951年在美国的压力下通过的对中华人民共和国的贸易禁运。同时，同苏联和其他社会主义国家发展贸易的主张也在西欧深得人心。
