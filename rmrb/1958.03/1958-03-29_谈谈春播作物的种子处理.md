    On Seed Treatment for Spring-Sown Crops
    Wang Kening
    The spring sowing season is approaching. In order to prevent various seed-borne diseases and ensure a large increase in cotton and grain production, seed treatment must be carried out before sowing. I will now introduce several seed treatment methods for major spring-sown crops, hoping that the transferred cadres spread throughout the country will gradually test and promote these scientific methods in the vast rural areas.
    I. Rice: For early and mid-season rice, soaking the seeds in a solution of 1/1000 concentration of Xilisheng or Ceresan for 48 hours can kill various pathogens such as rice blast and bakanae disease on the rice seeds. When sowing late-season rice, due to the higher temperature, a solution of 2/1000 concentration of Xilisheng or Ceresan should be used to soak the seeds for 6 to 12 hours. After soaking, the seeds should be rinsed with clean water before germination.
    II. Wheat: Spring wheat can be treated with Ceresan or Xilisheng at a ratio of 2/1000 to prevent bunt. If the wheat seeds are mixed with wheat nematode-infected grains, the diseased grains should be removed with a wheat nematode grain separator; or they can be floated in 20% salt water (10 jin of clean water plus 2 jin of salt) or 30% clay water (10 jin of clean water plus 3 jin of clay). The method is to wait until the salt water in the缸(gang - earthenware pot or vat) is completely dissolved or the clay water is evenly mixed, put the wheat seeds in a bamboo basket and sink the basket into the salt water缸, so that the water surface is higher than the wheat seeds. Stir the wheat seeds by hand to make the nematode-infected grains float, and then use a fine sieve or笊篱(zhaoli - skimming spoon) to scoop out the diseased grains. Repeat this floating selection several times until there are no diseased grains in the wheat seeds, then take out the seeds, wash off the salt or clay, and dry them for sowing. Before sowing, using constant temperature soaking can kill the loose smut bacteria inside the seeds. The method is as follows: immerse the wheat seeds in hot water at 50 to 55 degrees Celsius (the water surface should be 1 to 1.5 chi above the seed surface), stir thoroughly, and after the temperature drops to 45 degrees, cover the缸lid. Every 15 minutes, add hot water to adjust the temperature to maintain a water temperature of 45 degrees until soaking for three hours. Take them out and put them in cold water. After the wheat has cooled, take it out and dry it, and set it aside for sowing.
    Barley: Treating the seeds with Ceresan or Xilisheng at a ratio of 2/1000 or with 1% sulfur powder can prevent covered smut. The prevention and control method for barley loose smut is exactly the same as that for wheat loose smut.
    III. Cotton: Under timely sowing conditions (the sowing period is not too early), the hot water treatment and drug mixing method can be used in North China. The steps are: use hot water mixed with three parts boiling water and one part cold water, or use hot water at 55 to 60 degrees Celsius to scald the seeds for 30 minutes, stirring with a wooden stick to make the cottonseeds heat evenly. Filter out excess water from the scalded seeds, let them dry until half dry, and mix them with Xilisheng at a dosage of 5/1000 of the weight of the cottonseeds (dry land in North China can only use 4/1000 of the dosage). If Ceresan is used, the dosage should be increased to 8/1000. In order to mix the medicine evenly, the medicine powder can be mixed with 5% to 10% of the weight of the cottonseeds in plant ash, and then mixed on the seeds.
    In the case of earlier sowing periods, it is safer to use the drug mixing and smothering method. The method is to mix the medicine about 20 days before sowing using the same method as above. Divide the medicated seeds into two additions of water and pile them up. The first spraying amount is 50% of the weight of the cottonseeds. After spraying, pile the cottonseeds into small piles of about two chi, and smother for 12 hours. Then spread out, spray 30% of water, pile it up again and smother for 24 hours before sowing.
    IV. Coarse Grains: Treating seeds with 3/1000 Ceresan powder can reduce the damage of sorghum smut.
    Foxtail Millet: Treating seeds with 2/1000 Ceresan or Xilisheng can eliminate foxtail millet smut and reduce foxtail millet white leaf disease.
    In areas where foxtail millet nematode disease (commonly known as “premature death”, “red rust”, “blind ear”) is severely damaged, using one of the following two methods can effectively control this disease. (1) Constant temperature soaking method: first fill half a bag of seeds, prepare three times the amount of hot water, put the seed bag into the water at 57 degrees Celsius, quickly turn it to keep the water temperature at 56 degrees Celsius, soak for ten minutes, take out the seed bag and immediately put it in cold water and turn it for two or three minutes, pour it out and let it dry before sowing. (2) Arsenic trioxide seed dressing method: use 2/1000 arsenic trioxide powder and place it in a seed dressing device, shake it at a speed of 30 times per minute for three minutes, pour it out and set it aside for sowing.
    Sweet Potato: In areas where spring sweet potatoes are cultivated, using the warm water soaking method can effectively prevent sweet potato black spot disease. The method is to wash the soil off the good seed potato tubers that have been carefully selected with clean water, and then select them again. Then put the seed potatoes into a bamboo basket, and immerse the basket into warm water that has been pre-adjusted to a temperature of 58 to 60 degrees Celsius. The water surface should be 3 to 4 cun above the basket surface. Immediately lift the potato basket up and down after entering the water to make the water temperature even. Keep it between 51 and 54 degrees Celsius, and disinfection will be completed after 10 to 12 minutes. If the water temperature drops to 51 degrees, hot water needs to be added to adjust it.
    In addition, it should be noted that when mixing seeds with medicine powder, a seed mixer must be used to mix evenly. The amount of medicine used must be accurate. The seeds must be dried before they can be mixed with the medicine. If there are impurities in the seeds, they should be screened or winnowed in advance. People engaged in seed mixing work should wear masks.

    谈谈春播作物的种子处理
    汪可宁
    春播的季节快要到了，为了防治种子传染的各种病害，保证棉粮大增产，在播种以前必须进行种子处理。现在将几种主要春播作物的种子处理方法介绍于下，希望遍布全国的下放干部把这些科学方法逐步在广大农村中试验和推广。
    一、水稻：早、中稻用千分之一的西力生或赛力散水浸种四十八小时，可以杀死稻种上的稻瘟、恶苗等各种病菌。晚稻播种时，因气温较高，应采用千分之二的西力生或赛力散水浸种六至十二小时。浸完种后，随即用清水洗净种子，再行催芽。
    二、麦类：春小麦用千分之二的赛力散或西力生拌种，可以防治腥黑穗病。如果麦种内混有线虫病病粒，应当用线虫病麦汰除机汰除病粒；或用20％的盐水（清水十斤加入食盐二斤）、或30％的胶泥水（清水十斤加入胶泥三斤）进行漂选。方法是等缸内盛的盐水溶化完毕或胶泥水搅拌均匀后，把放到箩筐里的麦种连箩筐沉到盐水缸里，让水面高过麦种，用手搅动麦种使线虫病粒浮起，再用细箩或笊篱把病粒捞出。这样反复漂选几次，直到麦种里没有病粒，然后取出种子，洗去盐分或胶泥，晾干作种。播种前采用恒温浸种可以杀死种子内部的散黑穗病菌。方法如下：把麦种浸入摄氏50度到55度的热水里（水面要超出种子表面一尺到一尺半），充分搅拌后，温度下降到45度，盖上缸盖。每隔15分钟，加一次热水调节温度，使保持45度的水温，直到泡过三小时，取出放入冷水中，等麦子冷后，捞出晾干，留待播种。
    大麦：用千分之二的赛力散或西力生或用百分之一的硫磺粉拌种可以预防坚黑穗病。大麦散黑穗病的防治方法和小麦散黑穗病完全一样。
    三、棉花：在适时播种的情况下（播种期不太提早），华北地区可以采用烫种拌药法，其步骤为：用三份开水、一份凉水兑成的热水，或用摄氏55度至60度的热水烫种子三十分钟，用木棒搅动使棉籽受热均匀。将烫过的种子滤去多余水分，晾至半干，拌上用量为棉籽重量的千分之五的西力生（华北地区旱地只能用千分之四的药量）。如果用赛力散，药量应当提高到千分之八。为了拌药均匀，可先将药粉和在重量为棉籽重量的5％到10％的草木灰里，然后拌在种子上。
    在播种期提得较早的情况下，以使用拌药闷种法比较安全。方法是用与上面相同的方法在播种前约二十天左右拌上药。将拌过药的种子分二次加水，并堆起来。第一次喷水量为棉籽重量的50％，喷后将棉籽堆成二尺左右的小堆，闷十二小时。然后摊开，喷水30％，再堆起来闷二十四小时随即播种。
    四、杂粮：用千分之三的赛力散药粉拌种，可以减轻高粱黑穗病的为害。
    谷子：用千分之二的赛力散或西力生拌种可以消灭谷子黑穗病，减轻谷子白发病。
    在谷子线虫病（即平常所说的
  “倒青”、“红锈”、“瞎穗”）为害严重的地区，采用以下二种方法中的一种，可以有效地防治这种病害。（一）恒温浸种法：先装半袋种籽，准备三倍于种子的热水，在摄氏57度时把种子袋放入水里，迅速翻动，保持水温于摄氏56度，浸够十分钟后，取出种子袋立即投在冷水中翻动二、三分钟，倒出晾干，便可播种。（二）白砒拌种法：用千分之二的白砒粉放在拌种器内，以每分钟三十次的速度摇转三分钟，倒出留待播种。
    甘薯：在栽培春薯地区，采用温水浸种的方法，可以有效地防治甘薯黑斑病。方法是用清水把经过仔细挑选过的好种薯薯块上的泥土洗净，再挑选一次。然后将种薯放到箩筐内，连筐浸入预先将水温调到摄氏58度到60度的温水里，水面要高出筐面三、四寸，入水后立即上下提动薯筐，使水温均匀，保持51度到54度之间，经过十到十二分钟，即消毒完毕。如水温下降到51度时，需要加热水调节。
    此外应当注意的是在用药粉拌种时，一定要用拌种器才能拌匀。用药量必须要准确。种子一定要晒干的才能拌药。种子内如渗有杂质应当预先筛净或扬净。进行拌种工作的人应当带上口罩。
