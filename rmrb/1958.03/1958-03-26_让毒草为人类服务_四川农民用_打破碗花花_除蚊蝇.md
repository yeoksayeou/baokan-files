People's Daily special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: In the recent campaign to eliminate the four pests, members of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hexing Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, have effectively eliminated flies and mosquitoes by utilizing the wild plant "Broken Bowl Flower." This is a new discovery and creation of the working people in their struggle with nature. This method has three major advantages: (1) It utilizes local materials, saving money and accumulating fertilizer; (2) The method is simple and easy to implement, suitable for widespread promotion; (3) It is quick and effective.

The sap of the "Broken Bowl Flower" contains a strong irritant that can kill pests. If the sap from the stems and leaves of this plant gets on a child's hands, it will corrode the skin. Therefore, farmers often verbally teach children, "Don't pick this flower, or you'll break your bowl, and if you break your bowl, you won't be able to eat." Over time, "Broken Bowl Flower" has become the common name for this wild plant. Last year, the eighth team of the Hongguang Cooperative put "Broken Bowl Flower" into a manure pit, and no flies were found in the pit. This attracted people's attention. Its method of use is very simple: chop the collected "Broken Bowl Flower" into pieces, wilt it in the sun, and then sprinkle it in the manure pit (a few kilograms for a small pit, a dozen kilograms for a large pit). Three days later, all the flies will be killed. If the squeezed juice is sprinkled in the ditch, the mosquito larvae, wrigglers, will also not survive.

According to the farmers of the cooperative, this grass can also be used to ferment fertilizer, and its fertilizing effect is higher than that of green grass. Putting it into the manure pit kills insects and accumulates fertilizer, achieving two goals at once. This wild plant is found everywhere in Sichuan Province, growing in damp places along ditches, rivers, and in forests. The farmers of the Hongguang Cooperative are now paying attention to cultivating and protecting this precious grass, preparing to use it extensively during the periods of Beginning of Summer and Grain Full, so that flies and mosquitoes will be wiped out before they become adults.

After preliminary identification by agricultural science and related departments, it is believed that the "Broken Bowl Flower" is indeed effective in eliminating flies and mosquitoes. The Pixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to promote this method universally throughout the county. This shows that infinite treasures are hidden in nature, and once they are discovered and utilized, they can have beneficial effects on people's lives; even poisonous weeds can become useful things.

Introduction to "Broken Bowl Flower"
According to Professor Fang Wenpei of Sichuan University, Professors Xie Chengke, Xu Zhonglu, and Li Zhenghua of Sichuan Medical College, Lecturer Wang Xiankai, agricultural technicians Zhang Ruozhi and Zhao Anrong of the Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, "Broken Bowl Flower" is a perennial herb of the genus Ranunculus, resembling wild cotton in appearance. The stem is about 1.8 inches high, the basal leaves are like pentagons, four or five-lobed, the lobes are oval, green on the top, grayish-white on the bottom, and the petioles are very long; the stem leaves are sometimes like involucres, mostly opposite, with short petioles. The flowers are clustered in twos and threes at the top of the branches, the pedicels are long, with leaf-like involucres below, the flower buds hang down and stand upright when they open, the perianth is five-petaled, white or light red, the stamens are small and slender, covered with fine white hairs except for the stigma. According to analysis, its stems and leaves are acidic (PH = 5 or so), containing PROTO ANEMONIN, which has a strong irritant effect. Experiments show that it kills two-thirds of maggots in three hours, two-fifths of mosquitoes, one-third of flies, and seven-fifths of aphids. At the same time, it also has a high fertilizing effect and can prevent cutworms and rice borers. However, the extent of its effectiveness in treating rice borers cannot be determined and needs further research.

    让毒草为人类服务
    四川农民用“打破碗花花”除蚊蝇
    本报特约新华社专稿　四川省郫县合兴乡红光农业生产合作社的社员们，在最近的除四害运动中，利用野生植物“打破碗花花”有效地消灭苍蝇和蚊子，这是劳动人民群众在同自然界作斗争中一项新的发现和创造。这个办法有三大好处：（1）就地取材，既不花钱，又能积肥；（2）方法简便易行，宜于普遍推广；（3）时间短而收效大。
    “打破碗花花”的浆汁含有强烈的刺激性，能杀死害虫。这种植物茎叶内的浆汁沾在儿童手上，皮肤就受到腐蚀。因此农民常在口头上教育儿童说：“不要摘这种花，要了就要打破碗，打破了碗就不能吃饭。”久之，“打破碗花花”就成为这种野生植物的俗名了。红光社八队去年曾经把“打破碗花花”放到粪坑里，这个粪坑就没有发现苍蝇。这事引起了人们的注意。它的使用方法很简单：把采回的“打破碗花花”铡碎晒蔫后撒在粪坑里（小粪坑撒几斤，大粪坑撒十几斤），三天以后苍蝇就全部被杀死；把压榨出来的浆汁洒在阴沟里，蚊子的幼虫孑孓也活不成。
    据该社农民谈，这种草还可以沤制肥料，肥效比青草高，下到粪坑里既杀虫、又积肥，一举两得。这种野生植物在四川省各地都有，生长在沟边、河旁和树林中的阴湿地方。红光社的农民现在已经注意培植和保护这种宝草，准备在立夏、小满期间大量使用，使苍蝇、蚊子在变成成虫以前就受到歼灭。
    经过农业科学及有关部门的初步鉴定，认为“打破碗花花”消灭苍蝇、蚊子确实有效。中共郫县县委已经决定在全县范围内普遍推广这种办法。这事说明，在大自然界蕴藏着无限的宝物，它一旦被发现和加以利用，就能在人们的生活中发生有益的作用；甚至毒草也可以成为有用的东西。
    “打破碗花花”介绍
    据四川大学方文培教授，四川医学院谢成科、徐仲吕、李正化教授、王宪楷讲师，四川农业科学研究所张若芷、赵安荣农业技师等分析，“打破碗花花”是毛莨属的一种多年生草本植物，外形和野棉花相像。茎高一寸八分左右，根生叶像五角形，四、五裂，裂片像卵圆形，上面绿色，下面灰白，叶梗很长；茎生叶有的像总苞，多对生，叶柄短。花两三朵簇生于枝顶，花柄长，下有叶状的包，花芽下垂开时直立，花被五片，白色或淡红，雄蕊细小，除柱头外遍生细白毛，据分析，它的茎叶都是酸性（PH＝5，左右），含有白头翁素（PROTO
  ANEMONIN），有强烈的刺激性，经试验用以杀灭蛆，三小时死去三分之二；蚊死去五分之二；蝇死去三分之一；蚜虫死去七分之五。同时，它的肥效也很高，还可以防治土蚕和螟虫，唯对治螟效果的大小还不能肯定，尚待进一步研究。
