Title: Thoughts Inspired by Celebration

    Knowing that the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is about to be established, I cannot help but feel another surge of joy. I remember having this kind of "feeling refreshed when encountering a happy event" when the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established, when the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was established, and when the preparatory committees of the Tibet Tibetan Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were established. Moreover, every time I celebrate such a happy day, I cannot help but recall my two Hui friends.
    
    In the autumn of 1941, in Qu You Village, Ding County, Central Hebei District, we encountered a major mopping-up operation by the Japanese invaders. We, the wounded and sick soldiers, ran under the indiscriminate bombing of enemy planes and the strafing of machine guns, losing all our hats, shoes, and trousers, leaving only our underwear. We were hiding in a dense bean field, it was raining, and under us was a muddy swamp.

    Suddenly, Xiao Ma moaned and said, "Brother, I'm really too sleepy to hold on." Although I was not yet sixteen years old at the time, I immediately felt it was my inescapable duty upon hearing this call. They were indeed younger than me; Xiao Ma was at most only thirteen years old. I took their hands and said, "Sleep peacefully, I'll watch out for the enemy." In the mud, the two of them fell asleep one after another. Two icy little hands remained in my hands.
    
    Rainwater gathered into beads from the bean leaves and dripped onto my bare back, like ice needles piercing my spinal cord. The Japanese devils fired signal flares, and for a moment, there were shouts of people and neighing of horses, all rushing towards the bean field. I immediately squatted down, clenched the two little hands in my hands, held my breath, and stared straight at the savage-like ranks, so that when they rushed into the bean field, I could pull my two little brothers to transfer. Only after the Japanese devils had all passed did I realize that I had fallen asleep while squatting at some unknown time.
    
    The next day, Xiao Ma developed a high fever. We had no choice but to entrust him to a mass woman who had moved to the outside of the village to take care of him. I still remember how that woman in her twenties, with a white round face, big eyes, and her hair cut and fitted with a false bun, held such a male comrade, whose face was flushed from the fever and who was only wearing a pair of underpants, in her arms with tears in her eyes. I quietly told her: "Please take extra care, this little comrade of ours is a Hui person, don't give him pork or lard." She nodded and said, "The chickens have all been killed... maybe I can find some eggs!"
    
    At that time, I did not understand what national issues meant. But I understood that whether they were Han, Hui, or any other ethnicity, they were like the three of us, close brothers. The fate of life and death were closely linked. Today, all ethnic compatriots have mounted swift horses and are leaping towards socialism. Therefore, I am even more convinced that what the Party says about all nationalities being brothers and that all nationalities demand unity is absolute truth. The basis of this understanding lies in this experience of mine. Doesn't the fact already show that not only in the revolutionary ranks under the leadership of the Party are comrades of all ethnicities as close as brothers, but even in that ordinary peasant family, aren't they also as close as one family?
    
    Naturally, we are all just a part of one ethnicity, like a cell in the human body; however, examining the combination of these two cells, just like examining slices in a laboratory, allows us to examine the whole of each ethnicity. Because we are all ordinary people, I dare to believe that the vast majority of people in each ethnicity are like this. As for the very few people in each ethnicity who seek to divide the unity of all ethnicities, such as extreme Han chauvinists and extreme local nationalists in each ethnicity, they are all harmful toxins. I abhor Han chauvinism as I abhor a boil on my body, and isn't it the same for the minority brothers' aversion to local nationalism? I believe that my two friends' hatred of Ma Bufang, the scum of their ethnicity, would not be less than mine. The hatred between ethnicities provoked by the ruling classes of past dynasties cannot explain the entire relationship between the people of all ethnicities; without the common learning and common assistance of all ethnicities, the thousands of years of common life of the people of all ethnicities would be unimaginable. I believe that the history of mankind is more comprehensive than any legend or any historical record. The experiences of me, my friends, and that ordinary peasant woman are ironclad evidence.
    
    It is precisely based on this understanding that every time I come across the establishment of an autonomous region of any ethnicity, I have a feeling of celebration. Take this Zhuang Autonomous Region, for example. Although I have never come into contact with a Zhuang compatriot, when I understand the history of the Zhuang people and the Han people jointly adhering to the land revolution and now jointly carrying out socialist construction, I also believe that the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is a step forward for the Zhuang brothers on the road of socialism, a step forward towards a happy life. How can this not make people rejoice and be encouraged? While rejoicing and being encouraged, how can one not strive to oppose the local nationalists who undermine socialism?

    喜庆中想到的
    贾恭
    知道广西僮族自治区就要成立，不由又一阵喜上心头。我的这种“人逢喜事精神爽”，记得在内蒙古自治区成立的时候，在新疆维吾尔族自治区成立的时候，以及西藏藏族自治区和宁夏回民自治区的筹备委员会成立的时候，就都曾有过。而且，每逢这样喜庆日子，总不免要回忆起我的两个回族朋友来。
    1941年秋天，在冀中区定县的矍由村，遭逢了一次日寇的大扫荡。我们这些伤病员，在敌机滥炸和机枪的扫射下，奔跑得衣帽鞋裤全都丢光，各人只剩下了贴身的裤衩。潜伏在一块浓密的豆田里，天下着雨，身下是一片水浆泥泞。
    忽然，小马呻吟着说：“大哥，我实在瞌睡得熬不住了。”虽然我当时也还不满十六周岁，但听到了这声呼唤，立刻便觉得责无旁贷了。他们的确比我更小，叫作小马的最多只有十三岁。我拉着他们俩的手说：“放心睡吧，我监视敌人。”在泥浆里，两个人先后睡去了。两只冰凉的小手，还都留在我的手里。
    雨水从豆叶上汇成珠颗，再点点滴到我赤着的脊背上，像冰针穿刺脊髓。鬼子们打起了信号弹，一时人喊马嘶，都朝豆田奔来。我立刻蹲起来，攥紧手里的两只小手，屏住呼吸，直盯着狂兽般的行列，以便在它窜进豆田里来时，拉起我的两位小兄弟转移。直待鬼子们走完，我才在不知什么时候蹲着睡着了。
    第二天，小马发起高烧来。我们只好把他交托给一个转移到村外来的群众妇女去照管。我还记得那位二十多岁的妇女，一张白圆的脸，两只大眼，剪了的头发又装上了假髻，她是如何含着热泪把这样一个烧得面孔通红、又只穿着一个小裤衩的男同志抱在自己的怀里。我悄悄告诉她：“请你多费心，我们这位小同志是个回民，不要给他吃猪肉和猪油。”她点了点头说：“鸡都被杀光了……也许还能找到些鸡蛋的吧！”
    那时我还不理解什么叫民族问题。但却懂得不管是汉族、回族，或是什么族，都像我们三个这样的是亲兄弟。生死存亡的命运，都是紧密相连的。今天各族同胞都已跨上千里马，向社会主义跃进了。于是，我便越加相信党所说各民族是兄弟，各民族人民都要求团结的话，是绝对真理。这理解的基础里也就有着我的这一段经历。事实不是已经说明，不仅在党领导下的革命队伍里，各族同志都亲如兄弟，即使在那个普通的农民家里，他们不也是亲如一家吗？
    自然，我们都只不过各是一个民族里的一分子，犹如人体上的一个细胞；然而，考察这样两个细胞的结合，正如在实验室里考察切片一样，可以透过这对各个民族的整体加以考察。由于我们都是普通人，我便敢于相信各个民族的绝大多数人都是这样的。至于各民族中都有一种极少数力求分裂各民族团结的人，例如极端的大汉族主义者和各民族中的极端地方民族主义者，都是一些有害的毒物。我厌恶大汉族主义，就如厌恶身上的脓疮，而各少数民族的兄弟们的厌恶地方民族主义，又何尝不是这样。我就相信我的那两位朋友，对他们民族的败类马步芳的痛恨程度，是不会低于我的。由历代统治阶级所挑起的各民族间的仇恨，并不能说明各族人民之间的全部的关系；没有各民族的共同学习和共同帮助，各族人民共同生活的这几千年历史，便是不可想像的。我以为人类的历史，是比任何传说和任何史书的记载更为全面的。我和我的朋友以及那个普通农妇的经历便是铁的证据。
    正是基于这种认识，每逢到不论哪个民族自治区的成立，我都有一种喜庆的感觉。就拿这僮族自治区来说，我虽不曾接触过一个僮族同胞，但当理解了僮族人民同汉族人民一起坚持土地革命，现在又一同进行社会主义建设的历史以后，便也就相信了僮族自治区的成立，正是僮族兄弟们在社会主义道路上跨进了一步，向幸福的生活跨进了一步。这又怎能不使人欢欣鼓舞呢？在这欢欣鼓舞的同时，又怎能不使人奋力去反对那破坏社会主义的地方民族主义者呢？
