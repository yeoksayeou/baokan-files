(Our newspaper Tianjin, March 3rd dispatch) The Industry Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee held an on-site meeting at the Tianjin Enamel Factory on the 1st to promote the factory's experience in carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

This was the first experience exchange meeting held by Tianjin's industrial departments since launching the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. Thousands of cadres from district committees, industrial bureaus, trade union organizations at all levels, and many factories attended the meeting. They visited various workshops of the factory and the anti-waste exhibition, and listened to the experience introduction made by the leading cadres of the Tianjin Enamel Factory. Comparing the situation of their own factories, the leading cadres of many factories realized that their factories' determination to carry out the movement was not strong enough, the movement was slow to start, and they were determined to catch up and forge ahead.

    天津市委工业工作部召开现场会议
    推广天津搪瓷厂的经验
    本报天津3日电　中共天津市委工业工作部1日在天津搪瓷厂召开现场会议，推广了这个厂开展反浪费反保守运动的经验。
    这是天津市工业部门开展反浪费反保守运动以来举行的第一次经验交流会。各区委、各工业局、各级工会组织以及许多工厂的几千名干部参加了会议。他们参观了这个厂的各个车间和反浪费展览会，听取了天津搪瓷厂领导干部所作的经验介绍。许多工厂的领导干部对比自己工厂的情况，发觉本厂开展运动的决心不够大，运动开展迟缓，决心急起直追，迎头赶上。
