    Glass Cloth
    The Shanghai Yaohua Glass Factory has recently trial-produced the first batch of cloth woven from glass fiber.
    Glass fiber is made from the same raw materials used to manufacture ordinary glass. It is as fine, white, and soft as cotton, and also has the characteristics of insulation, high-temperature resistance, acid resistance, and high tensile strength. Glass fiber can be used to weave glass cloth, make hollow ropes, glass ribbons, and can also be wrapped around copper wires to make insulated wires. Glass cloth can not only be used as insulating cloth and transmission belts, but also as tire cord fabric; glass hollow ropes and glass ribbons are indispensable materials for manufacturing electric motors.

    玻璃布
    上海耀华玻璃厂最近试用玻璃纤维织成了第一批布。
    玻璃纤维是用制造普通玻璃用的原料制成的，跟棉花一样纤细、洁白和柔软，还具有绝缘、耐高温、耐酸和拉力强的特点。用玻璃纤维可以织玻璃布，制空心绳、玻璃丝带，还可以包在铜线上做绝缘线。玻璃布不但可以做绝缘布、传动带，还可以做轮胎帘子布；玻璃空心绳和玻璃带都是制造电动机不可缺少的材料。
