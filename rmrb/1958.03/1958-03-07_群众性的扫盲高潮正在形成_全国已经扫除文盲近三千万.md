Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Alongside the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a mass literacy campaign is taking shape. Based on the situation in various regions, the target set by the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, which aims to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people nationwide within twelve years, can be achieved ahead of schedule. Currently, nearly 30 million people have been freed from illiteracy nationwide, and over four thousand units in fifteen provinces and cities have emerged with no illiterate young or middle-aged people. Among them, Harbin City and Ning'an County in Heilongjiang Province, and Jin County in Liaoning Province, are the earliest cities and counties nationwide to have basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. More than ten counties in both Heilongjiang and Liaoning Provinces have basically eliminated illiteracy among young farmers. Illiteracy among cadres at the township level and above across the country has been basically eliminated. The illiteracy rate among workers has dropped from about 80% in the early days of liberation to 41%.

Many young and middle-aged people in various places, when they shed the "illiterate" label, joyfully put on new clothes, beat gongs and drums, and celebrated a cultural transformation as if it were a festival. The broad masses have established the determination and confidence to further advance towards culture and science. After the cadres of agricultural cooperatives and teams mastered literacy, their ability to manage production improved, their work became planned and summarized, and they could also take notes when learning advanced experiences and technologies. The commune members of Longtang Township in Guangshan County, Henan Province, proposed: to muster their energy, continue their efforts, and raise their educational level to above primary school by 1959.

Most of the advanced units that have basically eliminated illiteracy have done so through a relatively long period of literacy work, and then through concentrated efforts over about a year or so during the two upsurges of socialist transformation and the nationwide rectification campaign. Their experience proves that success depends on human effort. As long as leadership is strengthened, the masses are relied upon, and enthusiasm is aroused, the goal of eliminating illiteracy ahead of schedule can be achieved.

Many people's schools in various places are run by relying on the strength of the masses. If there are no classrooms, they build them themselves. If there are no funds for running the school, they collectively reclaim wasteland, chop firewood, sell it for money, and then buy lamp oil, coal, and books. If there are no learning tools, they grind bluestone into slates and use mountain peach pits as abacuses. Everything is done by the masses themselves.

Currently, the Party and administrative leadership departments in many provinces and cities have fully assessed the favorable conditions for literacy work, broken with conservative thinking, and formulated plans for a great leap forward in literacy work. The Heilongjiang and Liaoning Provincial Party Committees and Provincial People's Committees have proposed plans to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the provinces within the next three years. Jiangsu, Shanxi, Jilin, Shandong, Fujian, Anhui, Henan and other provinces and cities have also proposed plans to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in their respective provinces and cities within four or five years. These provinces and cities will achieve the targets required by the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft) five to seven years ahead of schedule.

### 群众性的扫盲高潮正在形成  全国已经扫除文盲近三千万

    群众性的扫盲高潮正在形成
    全国已经扫除文盲近三千万
    据新华社6日讯　在工农业生产大跃进的同时，一个群众性的扫盲高潮正在形成。根据各地情况来看，全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的全国在十二年内基本上扫除青年和壮年文盲的指标，可以提早实现。目前全国已经扫除的文盲近三千万，有十五个省市出现了四千多个没有青年或者青壮年文盲的单位。其中黑龙江省的哈尔滨市和宁安县，辽宁省的金县，是全国出现最早的全市、全县基本上扫除青壮年文盲的地方；黑龙江省、辽宁省都出现了十个以上的县基本上扫除了青年农民中的文盲；全国乡级以上机关干部中的文盲已经基本上扫除；职工中的文盲由解放初期的80％左右下降为41％。
    很多地方的青年和壮年，当自己拿掉“文盲”帽子的时候，都兴高彩烈地像过节一样穿起新衣，打着锣鼓，庆祝文化大翻身。广大群众树立了进一步向文化和科学进军的决心和信心。农业社的社和队的干部掌握了文化后，管理生产的本领提高了，工作有计划有总结，学习先进经验技术也能记笔记了。河南省光山县龙塘乡全乡社员提出：要鼓起干劲，再接再厉，在1959年提高到高小以上文化水平。
    已经基本上扫除文盲的先进单位，大多是经过较长期开展了扫盲工作以后，在社会主义改造和全民性整风这两个高潮中，大约一年多时间内突击扫除的。它们的经验证明：事在人为，只要加强领导，依靠群众，鼓起干劲，提前扫除文盲的要求是可以实现的。
    各地很多民校都是依靠群众的力量办起来的，没有课堂，就自己动手修建；没有办学经费，就集体开荒、打柴，卖钱再买灯油、煤炭和书本；没有学习用具，就磨青石作石板，用山桃核作算盘，一切都是群众自己动手干。
    现在，许多省市的党、行政领导部门充分估计了扫盲工作的有利条件，打破了保守思想，制定了扫盲工作大跃进的规划。黑龙江省、辽宁省的中共省委和省人民委员会提出了今后三年内基本上扫除全省青壮年文盲的规划。江苏、山西、吉林、山东、福建、安徽、河南等省市也分别提出了四年或五年内基本上扫除全省、市青壮年文盲的规划。这些省市都将把全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）要求的指标提前五年到七年实现。
