    Criticisms from the Masses
    Small Personal "Savings," Big National Waste

    Our organization has 130 people who take the shuttle bus to and from work every day. The cars are rented. The rent for two cars is 31,064 yuan and 4 fen per year. That is to say, the state has to bear the transportation cost of 19 yuan and 9 jiao and 1 fen per person. If individuals were to buy monthly bus passes, it would only cost 3 yuan and 5 jiao per person per month.

    In Beijing, there are quite a few units like ours that rent cars every day. I suggest that transportation costs to and from work should be borne by the cadres themselves.

    A Big Clock That Doesn't Tell Time

    In many cities, you can see clocks erected high on the streets. This provides a lot of convenience for passers-by. The pity is that some street clocks are either "resting" for a long time, or they run too fast or too slow. Like the big electric clock at the east end of Hongqiao in Anshan, it has been resting for more than two months. Every time I pass by here, I ask myself: someone put it up, but doesn't anyone manage it?

    个人小“节省”国家大浪费
    我们机关有一百三十人每天上下班都坐交通车。车子是租来的。两辆车的租金全年三万一千零六十四元零四分。也就是说，国家要负担每人的交通费十九元九角一分。如果由个人买汽车月票，每人每月只需三元五角。
    在北京，像我们这样每天租车的单位很不少。我建议上下班的交通费应该由干部自理。

    不报时的大时钟
    在许多城市的街头，都可以看到高高树立的时钟。这给过往行人许多方便。遗憾的是有些街上的时钟，不是长期“休息”，就是走得太快或者走得太慢。像我们鞍山虹桥东头的大电钟，它已休息了两个多月了。每当我走过这里，我就自己问起自己：有人把它放上，难道就没人管吗？
