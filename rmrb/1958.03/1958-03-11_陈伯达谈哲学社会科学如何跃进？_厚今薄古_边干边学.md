Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Chen Boda, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the invitation of Guo Moruo, Deputy Director of the State Scientific Planning Commission, gave a speech today at the fifth meeting of the State Scientific Planning Commission on the topic of "Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past, Learn While Doing." He spoke about how to achieve a great leap forward in philosophy and social sciences.

Chen Boda first assessed the work of philosophy and social sciences in the eight years since liberation. He said that although philosophy and social sciences have lagged behind the actual revolutionary practice since liberation, the achievements are still primary, and a group of new forces has grown; many good articles criticizing bourgeois academic thought have been published; after the ideological remolding, rectification movement, and the anti-Rightist struggle, a considerable number of bourgeois intellectuals have solved or partially solved their worldview problems and have turned to or are approaching the working class. Then he pointed out that the main shortcomings in philosophy and social sciences now are "always mentioning the Three Dynasties" (referring to Xia, Shang, and Zhou) and scholasticism divorced from revolutionary practice; a group of bourgeois intellectuals are evading socialist reality and political life, trying to hide in the ivory tower of the "Three Dynasties," and only like to discuss things that happened thousands of years ago or at least more than a hundred years ago. He believes that archaeology is permissible, but the main force of the academic community should not be used for archaeology. The main force should be used to study contemporary reality. Moreover, the purpose of archaeology should also be to "review the old and know the new." He quoted Marx's words here: "Any true philosophy is the quintessence of the spirit of its time." He said that, however, some philosophers' philosophical articles do not show this at present. Chen Boda also quoted Marx's theory that "human anatomy is a key to monkey anatomy" and "capitalist economy provides keys to ancient economy, etc." to illustrate our method of studying problems, which should mainly start from the modern era to the ancient era, and should overcome the current tendency of focusing on the study of ancient times.

When talking about learning while doing, Chen Boda criticized those bourgeois intellectuals who are arrogant, conceited, look down on the working class, look down on the working people, and look down on the veteran cadres. He said that those who despise the working people have the right to be despised by the working people.

Chen Boda said that school education can certainly cultivate many talents, and we must pay attention to school education, but those who have attended university, gone abroad, and obtained doctoral degrees in the past are not necessarily truly knowledgeable. On the contrary, some truly knowledgeable people have not attended university, gone abroad, or obtained doctoral degrees. Now, a group of veteran cadres from working-class backgrounds, who had not received formal education in the past, but have been able to begin to master scientific and technological work through hard work in their jobs, have emerged in various positions; and there are also some units where some scientific and technological problems that have not been solved by scientific and technical personnel for a long time, but have been quickly solved after mass discussion. These new phenomena illustrate the new great leap forward of the working people and veteran cadres learning while doing.

Chen Boda finally said that philosophy and social sciences can have a great leap forward, and should have a great leap forward, and one of the methods of the great leap forward is to "emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, learn while doing." The so-called emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past means not to de-emphasize the present and emphasize the past; the so-called learn while doing means that it is not necessary to learn well before doing. This is exactly what Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is more important learning," and "doing is learning."

    陈伯达谈哲学社会科学如何跃进？
    厚今薄古　边干边学
    新华社10日讯　中共中央宣传部副部长陈伯达今日应国务院科学规划委员会副主任郭沫若的邀请，在国务院科学规划委员会第五次会议上作了关于“厚今薄古，边干边学”的讲话。他谈的是哲学社会科学如何跃进的问题。
    陈伯达首先对解放后八年来的哲学社会科学工作作了估价。他说，解放以来哲学社会科学虽然还落后于革命的实际，但成绩还是主要的，一批新生力量已经成长；发表了不少好的、批判资产阶级学术思想的文章；经过思想改造、整风运动和反右派斗争以后，有相当一批资产阶级知识分子已经解决或部分解决了自己的人生观宇宙观问题，转向或靠近工人阶级。接着他指出，现在哲学社会科学中的主要缺点是“言必称三代”（指夏、商、周）、脱离革命实践的烦琐主义；有一批资产阶级知识分子逃避社会主义的现实政治生活，企图躲到“三代”的象牙塔中去，只喜欢讨论几千年前至少是一百多年前的事。他认为考古是可以的，但不能用学术界的主要力量去考古。主要力量应该用于研究当代的现实。而且考古的目的，也应该是为了“温故而知新”。他在这里引用了马克思的话：“任何真正的哲学，都是自己时代精神的精华”。他说，但是，我们现在有些哲学家的哲学文章并没有表现这一点。陈伯达又引用了马克思说的“人体解剖对于猴体解剖是一把钥匙”、“资本主义经济为古代经济等等提供了钥匙”的理论，来说明我们研究问题的方法，主要的应该从现代开始到古代，应该克服目前那种偏重研究古代的倾向。
    在谈到边干边学的时候，陈伯达批判了那些自高自大、翘起尾巴、瞧不起工人阶级、瞧不起劳动人民、瞧不起老干部的资产阶级知识分子。他说，渺视劳动人民的人，劳动人民就有权利渺视他。
    陈伯达说，学校教育当然能够培养出很多人才，我们必须注意学校教育，但是过去进过大学、出过洋、得过博士学位的人并不一定都是真正有学问的，相反的，有些有大学问的人却并没有进过大学、出过洋、得过博士学位。现在在各种岗位上已经出现了一批由劳动者出身、原来没有受过正规教育、但在工作中经过努力学习已经能够开始掌握科学技术工作的老干部；还有些单位存在一些科学技术问题，是科学技术人员多时没有解决的，但一经群众讨论，就很快地得到了解决。这些新气象说明了劳动人民和老干部边干边学的新跃进。
    陈伯达最后说，哲学社会科学可以跃进，应该跃进，而跃进的方法之一就是“厚今薄古，边干边学”，所谓厚今薄古，就是说，不要薄今厚古；所谓边干边学，就是说，不一定要学好了才干。这正是毛主席说的“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”、“干就是学习”。
