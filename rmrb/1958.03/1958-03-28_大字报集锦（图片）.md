    A Collection of Big-Character Posters
    Ding Shen soars gracefully into the highest heaven,
    So happy he forgets himself.
    May I ask how he can be so clear and refined?
    A book is published in the world.
    Writing a book is worth ten thousand coins,
    Fame and fortune surpass even the immortals.
    If Tao Zhu understood the joy within,
    He wouldn't bother calculating, just sharpen his pen.
             Lu Bing
