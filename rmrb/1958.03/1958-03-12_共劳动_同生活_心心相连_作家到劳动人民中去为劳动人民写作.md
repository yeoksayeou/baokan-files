Common Labor, Shared Life, Hearts Linked
Writers Go Among the Working People to Write for the Working People

    Izu Writer Li Qiao Goes to Liangshan for the Third Time
    Braving the bitter cold, I go to Liangshan,
    Undeterred by a thousand miles of arduous journey;
    If only the mountain area becomes advanced,
    Ten years of hard work, my heart will be content!
    This is a poem written by the Izu writer Li Qiao after recently arriving in Liangshan.
    Li Qiao had previously gone to Ninglang Izu Autonomous County, a concentrated area of Izu people in Liangshan, twice in 1954 and 1956, and wrote the book "Laughing Jinsha River." This book was even translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union.
    Li Qiao set off for Liangshan for the third time in late February. When he arrived in Ninglang, he saw that the three thousand slaves who had just been liberated had established a farm under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the state. Nearly fifty years old, Li Qiao was deeply moved by the happy prospects of his ethnic people and determined to join the farm as an ordinary peasant. Now, Li Qiao has joined the Paomaping Farm to work. While working together with his ethnic people, he is preparing to complete the second part of "Laughing Jinsha River."

    Writer—Shipbuilding Worker
    "We labor in this enormous workshop,
    The roof is the red sun, white clouds, and blue sky,
    If you ask why there are no walls,
    Listen to the Yangtze River's surging waves."
    This is a section from the "Song of the Shipbuilding Workers" recently written by the writer Zhao Zi, no, the shipbuilding worker Zhao Zi. Two months ago, the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association approved more than thirty writers to go to factories and the countryside, and Zhao Zi was one of them. He came to the China Shipbuilding Factory on the Huangpu River and became a "pattern maker" worker in the hull workshop.
    The workers in the hull workshop all operate in the open air on the riverbank. Regardless of wind or snow, Zhao Zi follows the master workers in using electric welding and rivets to join large steel plates into huge hulls. The "cold wind gun" rattles, the electric welding flashes brightly, releasing wisps of green smoke. In Zhao Zi's own words, that is: "My heart has begun to be linked with the hearts of my worker brothers."
    After a day of intense labor, Zhao Zi takes time in the evenings and on Sundays to write. He has already written several small works reflecting the "Double Anti" movement and the life of shipbuilding workers. He plans to live in this factory for two years and write a full-length novel on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce (the China Shipbuilding Factory is a joint state-private enterprise formed by the merger of dozens of small factories).
                                                                        (Zhang Feng)

    Good Friend of Anshan Workers
    On Sundays, the female writer Cao Ming, who lives in Anshan, is even more busy than usual. These are the days when she lectures or discusses together with her apprentices—the members of the Anshan Workers' Amateur Writing Group. For more than two years, Cao Ming has lectured them on literary theory, topic selection, character depiction, and other aspects of literature and art, and has revised and analyzed hundreds of their works.
    The fifteen steelworkers and soldiers who participate in the writing group were initially just literary enthusiasts who tried to write some works. Now, many have become relatively skilled amateur writers. Last year alone, they created more than one hundred poems, novels, essays, and other works. Recently, Cao Ming proposed to train more worker authors, so another writing group was established, with eighteen workers and intellectuals who had been sent down to work in the workshops as members.
    Cao Ming has been living in Anshan for almost four years, and she has become a familiar Anshan person to the steelworkers. She has served as the deputy party secretary of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Angang, and the steelmaking workers are willing to talk to her intimately.
    During this period, she has written some short stories and essays, and more than 200,000 words have been published. Now, she is writing a full-length novel reflecting the boiling life in the steelmaking plant.

    共劳动　同生活　心心相连
    作家到劳动人民中去为劳动人民写作
    彝族作家李乔三上凉山
    数九寒天上凉山，千里跋涉不畏难；
    但使山区变先进，十年辛苦心也甘！
    这是彝族作家李乔最近到达凉山以后所写的诗。
    李乔曾经在1954年和1956年先后两次到凉山彝族聚居的宁蒗彝族自治县，写出了“欢笑的金沙江”一书。这本书还被苏联译成俄文出版。
    李乔在2月下旬第三次动身前往凉山。当他到了宁蒗以后，看到刚获得解放的三千奴隶，在党和国家的领导和帮助下，已经办起农场。将近五十岁的李乔为本民族人民的幸福远景深深感动，决心加入农场当个普通的农民。现在，李乔已参加跑马坪农场劳动。在和本民族人民共同劳动中，他准备完成“欢笑的金沙江”第二部。
    作家——造船工人
    “我们劳动在这巨大的车间，
    屋顶就是红日、白云和蓝天，
    若问为何不见墙壁，
    请听浦江惊涛拍岸。”
    这是作家赵自，不，是造船工人赵自最近所作的“造船工人之歌”中的一节。两个月前，作家协会上海分会批准了三十多位作家下厂下乡，赵自便是其中之一。他来到黄浦江边的中华造船厂，在船体车间里当一名“出样”工人。
    船体车间的工人都是在江边上露天操作的，不论刮风下雪，赵自跟着老师傅们把大块钢板，用电焊、用铆钉，拼接成庞大的船体。“冷风枪”答答答的响，电焊闪闪的亮，放出缕缕青烟。用赵自自己的话说，那便是：“我的心，开始和工人弟兄的心，联结在一起了。”
    在一天紧张的劳动之后，赵自抽晚上、抽星期天的时间来写。现在已经写了几个反映“双反”运动和造船工人生活的小作品。他准备在这个厂内住两年，写一个资本主义工商业改造的长篇（中华造船厂是几十个小厂并成的公私合营厂）。

    鞍山工人的好朋友
    星期天，生活在鞍山的女作家草明比往日更紧张，这是她给她的徒弟们——鞍山工人业余创作小组的成员——讲课或是共同讨论的日子。两年多来，草明已给他们讲过了有关文艺思想、题材选择、人物描写等文艺理论，修改和分析了几百篇他们的创作。
    参加创作小组的是十五个钢铁工人和战士。开始，他们只是尝试着写过一些作品的文艺爱好者，现在，很多人已成了比较熟练的业余作者。去年一年中，他们创作了一百多篇诗、小说、散文等作品。最近，草明又提出愿意培养更多的工人作者，于是又有一个创作小组成立起来了，它的成员是十八个工人和下放到车间当工人的知识分子。
    草明落户在鞍山已快四年了，她已成了一个钢铁工人们熟悉的鞍山人，她当过鞍钢第一炼钢厂的党委副书记，炼钢工人们都愿找她谈谈知心话。
    这期间，她写了一些短篇小说、散文，已发表了二十余万字。现在，她正在写反映炼钢厂里沸腾生活的长篇小说。
