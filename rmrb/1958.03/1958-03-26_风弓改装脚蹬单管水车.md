    Windlass Modified into Foot-Powered Single-Tube Waterwheel
    Made by Cao Peizhi of the Shihuitun Village Agricultural Cooperative, Hejian County.
    It uses the old wooden frame, large wheel, iron axle, foot pedals, and hooks of an old windlass, plus the water-carrying wheel from an old five-wheel waterwheel, a chain, a pipe, and a water scoop. No new wood is needed at all.
    It can be used in wells, pits, ponds, ditches, and rivers. It can irrigate nine mu of land per day and night. (Attached picture)

    风弓改装脚蹬单管水车
    河间县石灰屯村农业社曹培芝制造。
    利用旧风弓的木架子、大轮子、铁轴、脚踏板和挂勾，外加旧五轮水车的带水轮一个、链子一条、管子一根、水簸箕一个构成，完全不用新木料。
    水井、坑塘、沟渠、河道均可使用。一昼夜浇九亩地。（附图片）
