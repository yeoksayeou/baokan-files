Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

You have gloriously completed the sacred mission entrusted to you by the people of the motherland to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country. Now you have returned victoriously. Today, we represent the Communist Party of China, various people's organizations, democratic parties, and the people of the whole country in extending a warm welcome to you—the meritorious heroes, and express our highest respect, most heartfelt gratitude, and cordial greetings.

The governments of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a joint statement on February 19. Subsequently, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers issued a statement on February 20, announcing that the Chinese People's Volunteers had decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958, with the first batch to be completed before April 30.

We, the people of the whole country, warmly support and fully endorse the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments and the statement of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The proactive withdrawal of all the Volunteer Army troops from Korea is a peace measure of great significance taken by China and Korea. It creates favorable conditions for promoting the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, breaking the deadlock created single-handedly by the United States on the Korean issue for several years, and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea. It once again demonstrates the sincerity of the Chinese and Korean peoples in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and fully demonstrates the firm confidence of the two peoples in safeguarding the cause of world peace. At the same time, the joint statement of the Chinese and Korean governments is another major step to proactively seek to ease the Far East situation and consolidate peace in Asia and the world, following a series of peace initiatives put forward by the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has been warmly praised and supported by the broad masses of people around the world.

As everyone knows, U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to the liberation of our people and the Korean people, and from the beginning, it has adopted a hostile attitude towards the people of China and Korea. It believes that it possesses superior strength and vainly attempts to subdue us by force before the people of our two countries have consolidated their strength, open a gap in the socialist East, and expand its colonial rule. In 1950, U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, while simultaneously occupying our territory of Taiwan. Ignoring the repeated warnings from our people, it brought the flames of war to the Yalu River, seriously threatening our security. In order to defend our motherland, support our neighbor, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world, you held high the banner of justice to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, and marched across the Yalu River in high spirits, fighting alongside the heroic Korean People's Army to resist the sixteen-nation invading army headed by the United States. The Chinese and Korean People's Armies fought hard for three years, eliminating 1.09 million enemies, including 390,000 U.S. troops, shooting down, damaging, and capturing more than 12,000 U.S. aircraft and more than 3,000 tanks, forcing them to retreat to the 38th parallel and sign the armistice agreement. This was the first military defeat of U.S. imperialism in history. People all over the world saw from this that U.S. imperialism can be defeated. Although it shows its fangs and claws everywhere, as Chairman Mao said, it is just a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. The great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples disrupted the U.S. imperialist aggression plan, greatly encouraged the people who love peace and the oppressed people around the world to strive for peace and freedom, and promoted the international tension to begin to ease and move towards being more conducive to peace.

Comrades! We are now in an unprecedentedly favorable international environment. The strength of the Chinese and Korean peoples is stronger than ever before. The advantage of the socialist forces over the imperialist forces, and the advantage of the peace forces over the war forces, which had long existed, has now undergone a new and decisive change, bringing the world situation to a new turning point: the East wind prevails over the West wind. Under such a general international situation, the Chinese People's Volunteers proactively withdrawing from Korea is conducive to further easing international tensions and conducive to the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

When the governments of China and Korea proposed a peace initiative—the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea—we cannot but seriously note that the United States is still unreasonably obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, openly refusing to withdraw all its invading troops from South Korea, and continuing to ship new weapons such as atomic cannons and missiles into South Korea to intensify the tense situation, further strengthening its colonial rule over the South Korean people, turning South Korea into a base for the United States to launch wars of aggression, threatening peace in the Far East and the world. We, the Chinese people, resolutely oppose this aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism. We firmly demand that the United States and all other countries with troops in South Korea promptly make a wise choice and unconditionally withdraw all their troops from South Korea, allowing the Korean people to conduct free elections according to their own will and realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland. If the United States continues to refuse to withdraw its aggressive troops, then it will never be able to escape the serious responsibility for dividing Korea and will inevitably be met with increasingly strong opposition from the Korean people and increasingly severe condemnation from world public opinion. If U.S. imperialism should lose its mind and dare to provoke a war of aggression again, in today's unprecedentedly strong Chinese and Korean peoples and world peace forces, it will inevitably be met with double the blow and a more shameful and painful defeat than before.

Dear comrades, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the internationalist obligation that the Chinese people should fulfill. The Chinese People's Volunteers are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and the most beloved people of the Chinese people. In the past, you bravely rushed to the Korean front to oppose aggression and defend peace. After the Korean armistice, you actively helped the Korean people heal the wounds of war, restore and develop production, and worked tirelessly with the Korean people to maintain the armistice agreement. Today, you are gloriously returning to the motherland for the sake of peace. Your spirit of high internationalism and revolutionary heroism will always be a model for the people of the motherland to learn from. The great achievements you have created on Korean soil will be forever recorded in history and last for generations.

For seven years, the brave and hardworking Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean government, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, have resolutely opposed imperialism, resolutely followed the socialist road, and resolutely supported the unity of socialist countries. Their great victory in resisting U.S. imperialist aggression and the brilliant achievements in post-war restoration and construction have made tremendous contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The heroic struggle waged by the Korean people has also played an important role in ensuring our country's security and the smooth progress of socialist construction. The reason why the Chinese People's Volunteers were able to successfully complete the glorious mission entrusted to them by the motherland is also inseparable from the meticulous care and great support and encouragement of the Korean people. On behalf of the Chinese people, we would like to express our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the heroic Korean people and to the Korean Workers' Party and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea government, headed by Kim Il-sung.

The people of China and Korea have always been as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe, supporting and encouraging each other, and having an incomparably deep friendship. The Chinese People's Volunteers have forged a brotherly friendship with the heroic Korean people in the seven years since they entered Korea. This is a fighting friendship cemented with the blood of the two peoples, and this friendship is eternal and unbreakable. After the Chinese People's Volunteers withdraw to their motherland, we will continue to further consolidate and strengthen the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Korean peoples in all aspects, and will continue to care for the common cause of the two peoples in resisting aggression and defending peace. If U.S. imperialism regards the peaceful action of the Chinese People's Volunteers proactively withdrawing from Korea as a sign of weakness and thinks there is an opportunity to take advantage of it, and launches a war of aggression again, then, as the statement issued by the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers said: "As long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their outstanding sons and daughters across the Yalu River again to fight together with the Korean People's Army to smash the enemy's aggression." The 600 million Chinese people will always remain true to their internationalist obligations and will always fight for the common interests of the Chinese and Korean peoples. We firmly believe that the 3,000-li of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be peacefully reunified. Dear comrades, your victorious struggle on the Korean battlefield has ensured the security of the motherland, defended the peaceful construction of the motherland and the peaceful life of the people. Please allow me to report to you here: In the past seven years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the social face of our great motherland has undergone fundamental changes. In 1956, we basically completed the socialist revolution on the economic front, that is, in terms of the ownership of the means of production. The nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle in 1957, as well as the decisive victories we have achieved on all fronts, have brought about a great leap forward in the socialist construction of the motherland. This year, on the basis of having completed and overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, the Second Five-Year Plan has been launched in accordance with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results and building the country through diligence and thrift. Now, the broad masses of people and cadres all over the country are drumming up their revolutionary drive and throwing themselves with unparalleled enthusiasm into the socialist competition to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, and will build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in ten to fifteen years on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture. We are confident that under the leadership of the Party and the government, we will be able to complete and complete ahead of schedule this glorious historical task.

Dear comrades of the Volunteers, now that you have returned to the motherland, you have added a strong new force to socialist construction. The people of the whole country are joyfully welcoming your victorious return. They will work hard in all aspects to learn from you, learn from your heroic fighting spirit and tenacious revolutionary will, strive to be more advanced and leap forward again, and push the socialist upsurge to new peaks one after another. At the same time, we will make greater efforts to further strengthen the unity of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity with the people of the world and all friendly countries, and strive to the end to eliminate the scourge of colonialism, to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to promote the cause of human happiness. Finally, let us shout:

Glory to the Chinese People's Volunteers!

Eternal glory to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea!

The fighting friendship cemented with the blood of the Chinese and Korean people will last forever!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    全国人民热烈慰问劳苦功高的英雄
    陈叔通在中国人民欢迎志愿军归国大会上的讲话
    亲爱的中国人民志愿军指战员同志们：
    你们在朝鲜光荣地完成了祖国人民委托给你们的抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣使命，胜利归来，我们今天代表中国共产党、各人民团体、各民主党派和全国人民，向你们——劳苦功高的英雄们，表示热烈的欢迎，并致以崇高的敬意、最衷心的感谢和亲切的慰问。
    我国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在2月19日发表了联合声明。接着，中国人民志愿军总部在2月20日发表了声明，宣布中国人民志愿军决定于1958年年底前分批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批将于4月30日以前撤完。
    我们全国人民热烈拥护和全力支持中朝两国政府的联合声明和中国人民志愿军总部的声明。从朝鲜主动撤出全部志愿军部队，是中朝两国所采取的一项具有重大意义的和平措施。它为促使一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退，打开几年来美国在朝鲜问题上一手造成的僵持局面，实现朝鲜的和平统一，创造了有利条件。它再次表明了中朝两国人民为和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，充分显示了两国人民对维护世界和平事业的坚强信心。同时，中朝两国政府的联合声明是在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国提出了一系列和平倡议后，又一次主动谋求缓和远东局势和巩固亚洲及世界和平的重大步骤。因此，受到了全世界广大人民的热烈赞扬和拥护。
    大家知道，美帝国主义不甘心我国人民和朝鲜人民得到解放，并且从一开始就对中朝两国人民采取敌视的态度，它自以为拥有优越的实力，妄想在我们两国人民还没有巩固自己的力量以前，用武力压服我们，在社会主义的东方打开缺口，以便扩张它的殖民统治。1950年，美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，同时侵占了我国的领土台湾，并且不顾我国人民一再提出警告，把战火烧到鸭绿江边，严重的威胁我国的安全。为了保卫祖国、支援邻邦、保卫亚洲及世界和平，你们高举起抗美援朝保家卫国的正义大旗，雄赳赳气昂昂跨过鸭绿江，同英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩作战，抗击以美国为首的十六国侵略军。朝中人民军队艰苦战斗三年，消灭敌人一百零九万，其中有美军三十九万，击落、击伤和缴获美国飞机一万二千多架，坦克三千多辆，迫使他们败退回三八线，在停战协定上签了字。这是美帝国主义有史以来的第一次军事失败。全世界人民从这里看到，美帝国主义是可以被打败的。它虽然到处张牙舞爪，但是，正如毛主席所说，它不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎。中朝人民的伟大胜利，打乱了美帝国主义的侵略计划，大大地鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民和被压迫人民争取和平和自由的斗争意志和胜利的信心，它促使国际紧张局势开始走向和缓和走向更有利于和平。
    同志们！现在，我们正处在一个空前有利的国际环境中，中朝人民的力量已经比过去任何时候都更加强大了，早已存在的社会主义力量对帝国主义力量的优势，和平力量对战争力量的优势，现在又发生了一个新的、决定性的变化，使世界形势达到了一个新的转折点：东风压倒了西风。在这样一个总的国际形势下，中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜是有利于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和有利于和平、民主、社会主义事业的。
    当朝中两国政府提出和平倡议——中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的时候，我们不能不严重地注意到美国仍然无理阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，公然拒绝从南朝鲜撤出一切侵略军队，并且要继续把原子炮、导弹等新式武器运进南朝鲜加剧紧张局势，进一步加强对南朝鲜人民的殖民统治，把南朝鲜变成美国的发动侵略战争的基地，威胁远东和世界的和平。我们中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义这种侵略政策。我们坚决要求美国和所有有军队在南朝鲜的其他国家，迅速采取明智的抉择，无条件地从南朝鲜撤出自己的全部军队，让朝鲜人民根据自己的意志进行自由选举，实现他们祖国的和平统一。如果美国继续拒绝撤退它的侵略军，那它就会永远不能摆脱分裂朝鲜的严重责任，并且将必然遭到朝鲜人民越来越强烈的反对和世界公正舆论日益严厉的谴责。如果美帝国主义竟然丧失理智，胆敢从新挑起侵略战争，在中朝人民和世界和平力量空前壮大的今天，必将遭到双倍的打击和比以前更加可耻的惨痛失败。
    亲爱的同志们，抗美援朝是中国人民应尽的国际主义义务，中国人民志愿军是中华民族最优秀的儿女，是中国人民最可爱的人。你们过去为了反对侵略、保卫和平而英勇奔赴朝鲜前线。朝鲜停战以后你们积极帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤，恢复和发展生产，并且同朝鲜人民一起为维护停战协定作了不懈的努力。今天，你们又为了和平而光荣返回祖国。你们这种高度的国际主义和革命英雄主义的精神永远是祖国人民学习的榜样。你们在朝鲜国土上所创建的丰功伟绩将永垂史册、万世流芳。
    七年来，勇敢勤劳的朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府的领导下，坚决反对帝国主义，坚决走社会主义的道路，坚决拥护社会主义国家的团结。他们反抗美帝国主义侵略的伟大胜利和战后恢复建设的光辉成就，对增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，对保卫远东和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。朝鲜人民所进行的英勇斗争，对于保障我国的安全和顺利进行社会主义建设，也起了重要作用。中国人民志愿军所以能够出色地完成祖国交给的光荣使命，也是同朝鲜人民无微不至的关怀和极大的支持和鼓舞分不开的。我们代表中国人民谨向英雄的朝鲜人民，向以金日成为首的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    中朝两国人民从来是唇齿相依，休戚与共，互相支援，互相鼓励，有着无比深厚的友情。中国人民志愿军在进入朝鲜的七年多时间里，同英勇的朝鲜人民结成了亲如手足的兄弟友谊。这是两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，这种友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的。在中国人民志愿军撤回祖国之后，我们将继续从各方面来进一步巩固并加强中朝两国人民的友谊和团结，并将继续关怀两国人民反抗侵略，保卫和平的共同事业。如果美帝国主义把中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的和平行动看作是软弱的表现，认为有机可乘，再一次冒险发动侵略战争，那末，正如中国人民志愿军总部发表的声明中所说：“只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再一次跨过鸭绿江来，同朝鲜人民军一起为粉碎敌人的侵犯而共同战斗。”中国六亿人民将始终不渝地忠于国际主义的义务，永远为中朝两国人民的共同利益而斗争。我们坚信：朝鲜三千里锦绣河山一定能够和平统一。亲爱的同志们，你们在朝鲜战场上的胜利斗争，保障了祖国的安全，保卫了祖国的和平建设和人民的和平生活，请允许我在这里向你们报告：七年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们伟大祖国的社会面貌已发生了根本性的变化。1956年，我们基本上完成了经济战线上的，也就是在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命。1957年的全民整风运动和反右派斗争及我们在各个战线上所取得的决定性的胜利，带来了祖国社会主义建设的大跃进。今年，在已经完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的基础上，又根据多、快、好、省和勤俭建国的方针开始了第二个五年计划。现在，全国各地广大人民和干部都鼓起革命干劲，以无比的热情投入比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛的浪潮，要在十年到十五年内，在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针，把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。我们有信心，在党和政府的领导下一定能完成和提前完成这一光荣的历史任务。
    亲爱的志愿军指战员同志们，现在你们回到祖国，又使社会主义建设增加了一支强大的生力军。全国人民都兴高采烈地欢迎你们胜利归来，他们要从各个方面来努力向你们学习，学习你们英勇的战斗精神和顽强的革命意志，争取先进更先进，跃进再跃进，把社会主义高潮一个接着一个推向新的高峰。同时，我们也将以更大的努力，来进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，加强同全世界人民和一切友好国家的团结，为消除殖民主义祸害，为保卫远东和世界和平，为促进人类幸福事业奋斗到底。最后让我们高呼：
    光荣归于中国人民志愿军！
    在伟大的抗美援朝战争中英勇牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中朝人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万世常青！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
