Every household plants mulberry trees,
No longer afraid of silkworms lacking food.
The silkworms are fat and spin many cocoons,
Everyone will wear silk clothes.

In the fifth nine and sixth nine [days after the winter solstice], plant willows along the river,
Protect the soil and prevent wind,
Ensure a bumper harvest.
        (Jiangsu Yancheng)

    新山歌家家户户多栽桑，往后不怕蚕缺粮，蚕儿肥胖多作茧，人人穿上绸衣裳。五九六九，沿河插柳，保土防风，确保丰收。
            （江苏盐城）
