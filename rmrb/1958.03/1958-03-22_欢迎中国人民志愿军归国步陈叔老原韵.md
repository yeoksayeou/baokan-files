Welcoming the Return of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Following the Original Rhyme of Chen Shulao
Shao Lizi

Admiring virtue has never required flexing military might,
Sublime proposals have resonated across the seas.
Friendship with Korea is as solid as a rock,
A promising dawn for peace in the East.
The mighty army enters the triumphal arch for the first time,
Amidst the cheers of the masses, the clamor goes unnoticed.
Anticipating those seeing them off across the river,
Smiles will surely be mixed with tears.
Ambitions rival the brilliance of the sun and moon,
Achievements extend beyond the battlefield.
Relying on labor for construction and support,
Promoting international spirit is commendable.
Combat friendship is deeper than the sea,
A boundless mind open to the long winds.
The general eloquently concludes his speech,
Then smilingly turns to Elder Weng, offering his sword hilt.
Boiling hot blood courses through the nation,
Today, joy overflows in Andong.
Eight years of struggle reach their conclusion,
The first merit should be counted as assisting Korea.
Today in the grand hall, a magnificent feast unfolds,
Amidst cries of "Long live," everyone raises their glasses.
Who doesn't love the most beloved people?
Praises are sung everywhere.
Guarding peace is a never-ending endeavor,
Steadfast courage is our teacher.
Although American imperialism is wildly rampant,
It will ultimately collapse on its own.
Among the representatives, there are several elders,
I accompany them, enduring the journey.
I am determined to learn from the heroes,
To dedicate myself to the country and constantly improve.
