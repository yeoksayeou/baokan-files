	Silkworm Eggs Enter Ice Storage
	Guizhou Province's first ice storage facility—the Tianlou Mountain Ice Storage in Zheng'an County—has been completed.

	In the past, Zheng'an's Tussah silkworms overwintered naturally, allowing only one rearing season per year. With this ice storage facility, Tussah silkworm eggs can undergo artificial "overwintering" through low temperatures in the summer. This will transform the silkworm farming from one season to two or more seasons, opening up broad avenues for rapid development of sericulture production in Zheng'an County.

	Editor's Note: Tussah silkworm is a type of silkworm. The biggest difference between this silkworm and regular silkworms is that it can be fed with Tussah tree leaves. A significant portion of the silkworms raised in Guizhou, Sichuan, and other provinces are of this type.
	Trying to Catch Peach Blossoms Shrimp
	Fishermen in areas such as Yexian County, Shandong Province, have begun fishing for the valuable product—Peach Blossom Shrimp—in the Laizhou Bay fishing grounds. Four fishermen from the Jiansheng Fishery Cooperative in Shihuzui Port, Yexian County, gave up the joyous Spring Festival and sailed out to sea in two fishing boats for shrimp fishing experiments. On that day, they caught fourteen jin of Peach Blossom Shrimp. The first shot was fired successfully, and the next day, nine more boats from the cooperative went to sea, catching more than forty jin in one day. Driven by their example, more than a hundred fishing boats in this port also went out to sea.
	One Hundred Agave Plants Per Person
	"Planting one hundred agave plants per person" is the call recently issued by the CCP Minzhong Party organization in Fujian Province to all farmers in the region.

	Many areas of Fujian Province are located in subtropical regions, making them well-suited for planting agave, which has wide industrial uses and high economic value. Agave planting can utilize slopes, hills, and embankments without encroaching on cultivated land.
	Gansu's "Treasure Grass" Seeds Transferred Out
	Gansu Province has transferred a large quantity of sweet clover seeds, known as "treasure grass," to support other regions.

	Since last winter, Gansu Province has already transported two million jin of sweet clover seeds to support more than ten provinces and autonomous regions, including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu.

	Sweet clover is a biennial wild legume. It grows rapidly, has strong adaptability, and can improve the soil. Generally, in the first year, each mu can yield 600 to 1,400 jin of forage; in the second year, it grows even more vigorously, yielding 600 to 2,000 jin of firewood per mu. Therefore, it can also solve the problem of fuel, feed, and fertilizer shortages for the masses.

    东西南北
    蚕种进冰库
    贵州省第一座冰库——正安县天楼山冰库已经建成。
    过去正安柘蚕均为自然越冬，一年只能养一季。有了这座冰库，就可在夏季将柘蚕种通过冰库低温来形成人工“越冬”。这样就可变养一季蚕为养双季或多季蚕，给正安县的蚕桑生产开辟了迅速发展的广阔道路。
    编者注：柘蚕是家蚕的一种。这种蚕和一般家蚕的最大区别，是可以用柘树叶饲养。贵州、四川等省饲养的家蚕，有很大部分是这种蚕。
    试捞桃花虾
    山东掖县等地的鱼民已开始在莱州渔场捕捞名贵的产品——桃花虾。掖县石虎嘴港口的建胜渔业社的四个渔民，放弃了欢乐的春节，驾驶着两只渔船，出海作捕虾试验。当日，捕了十四斤桃花虾。第一炮打响了，第二天，这社又有九只船出海，一天捕了四十多斤。由于他们的带动，这个港口的百余只渔船，也出海了。
    一人百株龙舌兰
    “每人种植一百株龙舌兰”，这是最近中共福建省闽中党组织向全区农民发出的号召。
    福建省许多地区地处亚热带，很适合种植工业上用途广、经济价值高的龙舌兰。种植龙舌兰可以利用坡地、丘陵、堤岸，不侵占耕地。
    甘肃“宝贝草”种籽外调
    甘肃省调出大批被誉为“宝贝草”的草木樨种籽支援外地。
    从去年冬季以来，甘肃省已经调运草木樨籽二百万斤，支援内蒙古自治区、山西、河南、山东、江苏等十多个省。
    草木樨是一种两年生的野生豆科植物。它生长迅速，适应性强，而且可以改良土壤。一般第一年每亩可收饲草六百到一千四百斤；第二年生长更旺盛，每亩可收柴草六百到二千斤。因此还可解决群众燃料、饲料和肥料缺乏的问题。
