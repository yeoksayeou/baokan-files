    “Only Speak Three Tenths of Your Mind to Everyone; Never Completely Give Your Heart Away” -- Unacceptable!
    Tianjin's Industrial and Commercial Circles Speak the Truth to the Party

    (Reported by Tianjin Daily) Tianjin’s industrial and commercial circles are undergoing an unprecedentedly profound political and ideological revolution. More than 1,400 industrialists and businessmen participating in the rectification and study sessions of the Municipal and District Federations of Industry and Commerce are currently engaged in a massive heart-to-heart movement.

    With the progress of the nationwide rectification movement, China's socialist construction is advancing rapidly like a stampede of ten thousand horses, and a great leap forward situation has emerged in all aspects of work. Influenced and promoted by this new situation, Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles have also joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. They proposed "giving their hearts to the Party" and "giving their hearts to the people," striving for simultaneous leaps forward in thought and work. Many have formulated transformation plans to accelerate the process of self-transformation. On March 10th, more than 6,000 members of industrial and commercial circles held a meeting to report to the motherland, kicking off the prelude to the heart-to-heart movement. In the days that followed, everyone "emptied their pockets," opened their minds, and the heart-to-heart movement surged, rapidly reaching a climax.

    This heart-to-heart movement is the best time Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen have opened up their minds. From as far back as the early days of liberation to as recently as after the rectification and debate, they have presented their views and opinions on everything from the overall domestic and international situation to personal work styles, on joint ventures, the Communist Party, the working class, and the socialist system. Some said that they were willing in word but not in heart about the implementation of joint state-private ownership in enterprises. Some said, "After the enterprise was handed over to the state, I felt uncomfortable." Some said, "Seeing that the production of joint ventures has improved, but I don't get any profits, I feel that it is not as good as private enterprises." So, they "want to take the capitalist road back." Others said, "Before the joint venture, I regarded the enterprise as my life. Even when I was getting a haircut or taking a bath, I was thinking about the enterprise's production. Now, I have no feelings for the enterprise." Some also said that they were obedient in word but not in heart to public representatives and employees, believing that "public representatives have no knowledge and cannot lead the enterprise" and "the working class has nothing worth learning from." Many also confessed that during the period of great airing of views, they resonated with the fallacies of right-wingers such as Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi and felt comfortable in their hearts. After expressing these thoughts, some people said with emotion, "I am ashamed that I have not properly talked to the Party about these messy thoughts for so many years." Therefore, many people have also made preliminary self-examinations and criticisms of some of their past thoughts and deeds that were detrimental to socialism. They felt that talking about the unspeakable things in their minds was truly "a weight off their shoulders" and "a sense of relief."

    During the movement, some districts also set up propaganda and mobilization stations to report on the progress of the heart-to-heart movement at any time. Some districts also organized people who had done well in the heart-to-heart movement to make typical reports, talk about ideological changes, and dispel some people's concerns, which played a positive role in the smooth development of the heart-to-heart movement. The industrial and commercial circles in Nankai District proposed, "We must dig out capitalist ideas like digging out pupae." The industrial and commercial circles in Heping District held an on-site meeting in Quanyechang. After listening to the experience of private personnel in carrying out the heart-to-heart movement, more than 20 units of private personnel on the spot said that they would compete with the private personnel in Quanyechang and immediately and thoroughly open their hearts. After the meeting, the industrial and commercial circles in the whole district set off a wave of heart-to-heart talks. During the movement, many industrialists and businessmen also gave each other advice in the form of "gifts" to inspire each other and help each other.

    The district committees of the Communist Party of China and the party organizations of enterprises have given guidance and support to the heart-to-heart movement of industrial and commercial circles. Leading cadres of each unit often give them reports, participate in their activities, and help solve problems. Employees of enterprises also welcomed the heart-to-heart talks of private personnel. In order to allow private personnel to concentrate their time on heart-to-heart talks, employees in many units took the initiative to take over their work and encouraged them in various ways. Some private personnel also wrote "welcome the supervision of employees" on the guarantee conditions. Now, the vast majority of employees hope that the heart-to-heart movement of industrialists and businessmen will go further and truly achieve genuine, fast, and thorough heart-to-heart talks.

### “逢人只说三分话，未可全抛一片心”——要不得！  天津工商界向党说真话

    “逢人只说三分话，未可全抛一片心”——要不得！
    天津工商界向党说真话
    本报讯　天津日报消息：天津工商界正经历着空前深刻的政治上思想上的革命。参加市、区工商联整风学习的一千四百多名工商业者，目前正进行着规模壮阔的交心运动。
    随着全民整风运动的进行，我国的社会主义建设事业如万马奔腾，飞速发展，各方面的工作都出现了大跃进的局面。天津工商界在这种新形势的影响和推动下，也投入了大跃进的行列。他们提出：“把心交给党”、“把心交给人民”，争取思想、工作同时跃进，有许多人订立了改造规划，以加速自我改造的进程。3月10日，工商界六千多人举行了向祖国汇报大会，揭开了交心运动的序幕。会后一连几天，大家“倒口袋”，敞开思想，交心运动汹涌澎湃，迅速达到高潮。
    这次交心运动，是天津工商业者敞开思想较好的一次。远至解放初期，近至整风辩论之后，大至国内国际大势，小至个人工作作风，对合营企业、对共产党、对工人阶级、对社会主义制度，他们都摆出了自己的观点和主张。有些人谈出，对企业实行公私合营是口愿心不愿。有人说：“合营后，企业交给了国家，心里觉得别扭。”有人说：“看到合营企业生产提高了，自己得不到利润，就感到不如私营企业优越。”所以“想走资本主义的回头路”。还有的人说：“合营前视企业如命，理发洗澡时，也惦着企业生产，现在对企业没有感情。”有些人也谈出，对公方代表和职工是口服心不服，认为：“公方代表没有学问，领导不了企业”、“工人阶级没有什么值得学习的”。不少人还谈出，在大鸣大放期间，听到右派分子章乃器、毕鸣岐等人的谬论引起共鸣，心里感到舒服。有的人在谈出了这些思想以后，感慨地说：“惭愧呵，多少年来这些乱七八糟的思想都没有向党好好地谈过。”所以，不少人也初步对自己过去一些不利于社会主义的思想和言行，作了检查和批判。他们感到把自己思想里见不得人的东西谈出来了，真是“如释重负”，“一身轻快”。
    在运动中，有的区还设立了宣传鼓动站，随时报道交心进行的情况，有的区还组织交心交得好的人作典型报告，谈思想变化，解除一些人的顾虑，这对交心运动的顺利开展，起了良好的作用。南开区工商界提出，“要像挖蛹一样挖资本主义思想”。和平区工商界在劝业场召开了现场会议，人们听了这里介绍的私方人员开展交心运动的经验，当场就有二十多个单位的私方人员表示，要和劝业场私方人员比赛，立即彻底交心，会后，全区工商界就掀起了交心的热潮。在运动中，许多工商业者还以“送礼物”方式，给别人提意见，彼此启发，互相帮助。
    对工商界的交心运动，中共各区区委和企业党组织，都给予了指导和支持。各单位领导干部经常给他们作报告，参加他们的活动，帮助解决问题。企业职工，对私方人员交心也表示欢迎。许多单位职工为了让私方人员集中时间交心，主动代替他们的工作，并且从各方面加以鼓励。有些私方人员也在保证条件上写了“欢迎职工监督”一项。现在，广大职工都希望工商业者的交心运动再深入一步，真正做到交心交的真、交的快、交的深透。
