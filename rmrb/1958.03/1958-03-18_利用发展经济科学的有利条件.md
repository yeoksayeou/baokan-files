    Utilizing Favorable Conditions to Develop Economic Science
    Sun Yefang

    Research work in philosophy and social sciences, especially economic science which is directly related to production, should undergo a great leap forward to serve the great leap forward in production.

    Some comrades have said that in this nationwide great leap forward, our philosophy and social science circles are lagging behind, even lagging behind the natural science circles. I personally feel this way too.

    We should not overemphasize difficulties, but should talk about favorable conditions, especially how to utilize these favorable conditions. The first favorable condition for the great leap forward in philosophy and social sciences is that in our country, the theory guiding our work is Marxism-Leninism. Since the national liberation, the Party and the state have conducted universal Marxist-Leninist education on a national scale and among all the people. Moreover, Comrade Mao Zedong and other Party leaders, in conjunction with the practice of our country's revolution, have made creative explanations and development of Marxist-Leninist philosophical and social scientific thought.

    Of course, we also have difficulties, mainly that our team specializing in Marxist-Leninist philosophical socialist scientific research is not large and the level is not high. However, we should not only see the strength of scientific research institutions and teaching and research departments in universities and colleges. We should also see the philosophical and social science workers scattered throughout the country, especially in government departments. In their actual work positions, many comrades have rich knowledge of class struggle and production struggle, and maintain close ties with the masses. However, we have not organized these forces. This is especially true in economic science. As far as I know, in recent years, comrades in financial and economic departments have done a lot of work in economic science research. In the past, scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, and business departments, newspaper and magazine (especially professional) editors did their own thing, with little contact, no division of labor and cooperation. In a word, the strength has not been organized. This is an important reason why our philosophy and social sciences have failed to fully exert their strength.

    Secondly, we have not done enough work in discovering and cultivating new forces. The older generation of philosophical and social science researchers were originally not many, and will gradually decrease in the future, which is a natural law. It is wrong to not pay attention to and not study how to cultivate new forces in a planned way. Now, not only in scientific research institutions and teaching and research departments of universities and colleges, but also in business departments, there are many young people who are at a very high level in studying Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences. We need to discover them and help them.

    In order to develop the research work of philosophy and social sciences, we should also accelerate the translation and publication of foreign philosophical and social science works. We urgently hope that the classic works will be translated and published in full as soon as possible, and also hope that more books on bourgeois philosophy and social sciences will be translated and published. In terms of economics, we should not only re-translate and publish the works of classical economists such as Adam Smith and Ricardo, but also translate representative works of some reactionary vulgar economists. Because if we do not study these foreign bourgeois works, it is difficult to thoroughly criticize modern bourgeois academic thoughts.

    利用发展经济科学的有利条件
    孙冶方
    哲学社会科学的研究工作，特别是同生产有直接联系的经济科学，应该来个大跃进，为生产大跃进服务。
    有同志说，在这全国性的大跃进中，我们哲学社会科学界是落后了，也落后于自然科学界。我个人也有这种感觉。
    我们不要太强调困难，而应该讲讲有利条件，尤其是如何利用这些有利条件。哲学社会科学大跃进的有利条件，首先是在我们国家里，指导我们各项工作的理论是马克思列宁主义；全国解放以来，党和国家又在全国规模、全体人民中间普遍地进行了马克思列宁主义的教育。并且，毛泽东同志和党的其他领导者又结合我国革命的实践，对马克思列宁主义的哲学社会科学思想，作了创造性的阐明和发挥。
    当然，我们也有困难，主要是我们专门从事马克思列宁主义哲学社会主义科学研究工作的队伍不大，水平不高。但是，我们不要光看到科学研究机关和大专学校教研室中的一些力量。我们还要看到散处在全国各地，尤其是在机关中的哲学社会科学工作者。在实际工作岗位上，不少同志具有丰富的阶级斗争和生产斗争的知识，同群众保持着密切的关系。但是，我们没有把这些力量组织起来。以经济科学而论尤其是这样。据我所知，这几年来财经业务部门的同志对于经济科学的研究，就是做了不少工作的。过去，科学研究机关，大专学校和业务部门，报刊（特别是专业性的）的编辑是各做各的，很少联系，没有分工合作。一句话说，力量没有组织起来。这就是我们哲学社会科学未能充分发挥力量的重要原因。
    其次，我们对于发现和培养新生力量的工作做得不够。老一辈的哲学社会科学研究工作者，原来就不多，今后还要逐渐少下去，这是自然规律。不注意和不研究如何有计划地培养新生力量是不对的。现在不仅在科学研究机关和大专学校教研室中，就是在业务部门，也有不少水平很不低的研究马列主义哲学社会科学的青年。我们须要发现他们，帮助他们。
    为了发展哲学社会科学的研究工作，我们还应该加速翻译和出版外国的哲学社会科学著作。我们迫切希望经典著作早日全部翻译和出版，并且希望多翻译和出版一些资产阶级的哲学社会科学书籍。以经济学方面来说，我们不仅应该把亚丹斯密、李嘉图等古典经济学者的著作加以重新翻译和出版，就是一些反动的庸俗经济学者的代表著作也要翻译。因为如不研究外国的这些资产阶级著作，是很难彻底批判现代资产阶级学术思想的。
