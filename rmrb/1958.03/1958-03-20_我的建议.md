    My Suggestions
    Let's Pay Attention to Saving Paper
    I often see many government offices and schools using mimeograph machines to print a lot of documents and forms, all using folio-sized paper, leaving large blank spaces on the sides after printing. Recently, I tried using a nine-opening paper to print, and the result was very good, with appropriate binding lines. Calculating this way, one large sheet of paper can print one more sheet, and one ream of paper can print five hundred more sheets, saving two yuan and five jiao. If each unit does this, the savings will be considerable.

    Let Crops Grow on Vacant Land
    Many government offices, schools, and dormitories are surrounded by vacant land, some of which is overgrown with weeds. I think that farmers are doing everything possible to plant every inch of usable land with crops in order to produce more grain. However, government offices and schools are allowing these vacant lands to be barren, which is not right. It is suggested that units with vacant land should plant sunflowers, corn, or vegetables to utilize idle land.

    Unify the Management of Guesthouses
    There are many guesthouses under central government agencies, but they have not yet been unified under management, resulting in chaotic expenditures and significant waste. The salaries, welfare expenses, and other costs of the staff in many agency guesthouses are covered by the administrative expenses of the agencies, but the surplus income of the guesthouses is not turned over to the state treasury. Some agencies divert these surplus funds to solve staff housing subsidies, expand nurseries, and other illegal expenses. Sometimes, guesthouses of Agency A are very vacant, while Agency B has to rent hotels for meetings. Therefore, I believe that a competent authority should be established to quickly unify the management of the central government agencies' guesthouses, formulate expenditure scopes and methods, stipulate that the year-end surplus, after leaving a certain amount of revolving funds, should be turned over to the treasury in full, and conduct supervision and inspection of income and expenditure on a regular basis. The occupancy situation of each guesthouse should be monitored and adjusted at any time to save state funds.

    我的建议
    大家注意节约用纸
    常看到许多机关、学校用油印机印了不少文件和表格，都是用八开纸印，印好后边上留很大的空白。最近我试用九开纸印，结果很好，也有适当的装订线。这样计算一下。一大张纸可多印一张，一令纸就能多印五百张，可节约两元五角。如果各单位都这样作，节约的数字一定相当可观。

    让空地上长起庄稼来
    不少机关、学校、宿舍周围，都有不少空地，有些空地上长满了荒草。我想，农民为了多打粮食，想尽一切办法把每一寸可利用的土地都种上庄稼。机关和学校却让这些空地荒芜，这是不应该的。建议有空地的单位，应种植向日葵、玉米或蔬菜，把闲地利用起来。

    把招待所统一管理起来
    中央机关招待所很多，但至今仍没有统一管理起来，开支很混乱，浪费也很大。有很多机关招待所的工作人员的工资、福利费等都在机关行政费内开支，但招待所的收入结余数，却不上缴国库。有的机关挪用这些结余数去解决工作人员房租补贴、扩建托儿所、以及其他不合法的开支。有时甲机关招待所空闲得很，而乙机关开会却去租赁旅馆。因此，我认为对中央机关招待所应有一个主管单位迅速统一管理起来，制定一些开支范围和办法，规定年终结余除留下一定数额的周转金外，其余扫数缴库，平时对收支情况要进行监督检查，对各招待所的忙闲情况应随时掌握和调整，以节约国家资金。
