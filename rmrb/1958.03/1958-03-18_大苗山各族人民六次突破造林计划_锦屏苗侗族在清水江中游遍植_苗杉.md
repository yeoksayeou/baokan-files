Xinhua News Agency, Nanning. The afforestation plan of Da Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County has been broken six times by the revolutionary drive of the masses. In order to rapidly and thoroughly change the poverty and backwardness historically left behind, and to welcome the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the people of various ethnic groups in Da Miao Mountain have launched a vigorous large-scale production movement since last winter. The afforestation plan was broken by the masses five times in a row, and finally revised to 500,000 mu of afforestation. In less than a month, it was broken again. Now, the afforestation of the whole county has exceeded one million mu. This number is more than seven times the afforestation task in 1957, and more than 360,000 mu more than the total afforestation during the first five-year plan.

This year, Da Miao Mountain has adopted the method of collectively going to the mountains to eliminate large areas of barren hills. The enthusiasm of the masses is unusually high, and the specifications and quality of afforestation are better than in previous years. The masses in the Antai District put forward the slogan "Fear neither heaven nor earth, work day and night, brave wind and snow, and don't go home until the task is completed." The number of people going to the mountains for afforestation accounts for more than 70% of the total labor force in the county. In many districts and townships, the old, up to seventy-five years old, and the young, down to ten years old, go to the mountains for afforestation together.

The afforestation movement was not smooth sailing. From February 1st to February 9th, there was a heavy snowfall that had not been seen in decades. Thousand-year-old trees were uprooted, and more than 7,000 jin of fish were frozen to death in the river. Despite this, the more than 40,000 people engaged in afforestation not only did not decrease, but continued to increase. At this time, 504 people from two Yao ethnic townships in Gandong District wanted to rush to the mountains, but the snow was thick and the road was slippery, making it impossible to pass. More than 20 young people bravely took the lead in digging snow to clear the way. They dug one hoe and moved one step until they reached the construction site. The people of all ethnic groups in Da Miao Mountain have heroically and tenaciously overcome the heavy difficulties of wind and snow in this way, determined to change the appearance of "Yuanbao Mountain" and build Da Miao Mountain into a happy mountain village of the socialist motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang. In Jinping County, southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which is rich in fir trees, forest farmers are launching activities to plant fir trees according to traditional customs. These days, tens of thousands of people are planting high-quality "Miao Fir" in the tilled soil of renovated barren mountains every day. They proposed to work hard for one year and green the whole county nine years ahead of schedule. At present, a high tide of afforestation has formed in the whole county. According to statistics on March 5, the afforestation of the county has reached more than 150,000 mu, and the area of mountain closure for forest cultivation is more than 210,000 mu. Afforestation alone has increased more than three times compared with last year.

Jinping County is located in the middle reaches of the Qingshui River. The Dong and Miao people here have a history of more than 100 years of planting fir trees in March. Their method is to loosen all the barren soil, remove weeds, and then plant seedlings. In the first three years, they interplant high-yield crops such as corn, millet, and sweet potatoes in the forest land, and carry out weeding and pruning every year. The fir trees grow quickly and can be felled after eighteen years.

    大苗山各族人民六次突破造林计划
    锦屏苗侗族在清水江中游遍植“苗杉”
    据新华社南宁讯　大苗山苗族自治县造林计划，六次被群众的革命干劲所突破。大苗山各族人民为了迅速地、彻底地改变历史上遗留下来的贫困落后状态，同时为了迎接广西僮族自治区的成立，从去年冬季以来，开展了一个气势蓬勃的大生产运动。造林计划一连被群众突破五次，最后修订为造林五十万亩，不到一个月又被突破。现在，全县造林超过了一百万亩。这个数字比1957年造林任务超过七倍多，比第一个五年计划期间造林总和还多三十六万亩。
    大苗山今年采取了集体上山消灭大片荒山的办法，群众情绪异常高涨，造林的规格质量也比往年好。安泰区的群众提出“天不怕，地不怕，白天干黑夜挖，大风大雪只等闲，任务不完不回家”的口号。上山造林的人数占全县劳动力总数的70％以上，不少区乡老至七十五岁，少至十岁，一齐上山造林。
    造林运动不是一帆风顺的。从2月1日到2月9日，下了几十年从未有过的大雪，上千年的大树翻了兜，河里冻死的鱼有七千多斤。尽管这样，造林的四万多人不但没有减少，反而不断增加。就在这时，杆洞区两个瑶族乡的五百零四个人要涌上山去，可是雪厚路滑，无路可走。有二十多个青年奋勇带头，挖雪开路，他们挖一锄、移一步的赶到了工地。大苗山的各族人民就是这样英勇顽强的战胜了风雪的重重困难。决心把“元宝山”改观，把大苗山建设成一个社会主义祖国的幸福的山寨。
    新华社贵阳专讯　黔东南苗族侗族自治州盛产杉木的锦屏县，林农们依照传统习惯，正在展开种植杉树的活动。这几天，每天都有几万人在修整好的荒山松土里栽种干高质坚的“苗杉”。他们提出要苦战一年，提前九年绿化全县。目前全县已形成造林高潮。到3月5日统计，全县造林已达十五万多亩，封山育林二十一万多亩；仅造林一项就比去年增加三倍多。
    锦屏县位于清水江中游，这里的侗、苗族人民在3月栽杉造林的习惯已有一百多年的历史。他们的方法是把全部荒土挖松，除去杂草，然后栽下树苗。头三年在林地里间种包谷、小米、红苕等高产作物，年年进行薅修，杉木生长很快，十八年后可以采伐。
