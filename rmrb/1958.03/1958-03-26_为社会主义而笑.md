    Smiling for Socialism
    Zhu Zhongyu
    Fifteen years ago, I went to a shop to learn the trade. The boss repeatedly told me: When standing behind the counter dealing with customers, never wear a mournful face; you should use a smiling face to extract money from the customers' pockets. For a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child, it’s not easy to force a smile when you don't feel like smiling. But in order to survive, I had to force myself to learn that hypocritical “business face.”
    Later, I climbed up the social ladder and became an intellectual. I changed from a seller to a buyer. From that time on, I felt disgusted whenever I saw a merchant's smiling face. I thought to myself: Don't give me that act; I used to smile even better than you!
    After Liberation, the salespersons in cooperatives, joint state-private enterprises, and state-owned stores were no longer so hypocritical. However, many people still served customers with an attitude of "buy if you want, don't buy if you don't," which made people feel uncomfortable.
    Since the Tianjin Department Store put forward the slogan of breaking with convention and making a great leap forward, and greatly improved its service attitude, earning praise, a new atmosphere suddenly appeared in commerce. Whether in state-owned stores or joint state-private stores, salespersons became amiable and smiling to customers. Their smiles were not forced, but truly came from the depths of their hearts. Because they understood that they were engaged in a great cause of serving the people and accumulating funds for socialism. I believe that all public servants of the people should learn from them and offer smiles to the people for the sake of socialism.

    为社会主义而笑
    朱仲玉
    十五年前，我到一家商店里去学生意。老板再三地嘱咐我：站在柜台后面应付买卖时，千万别哭丧着脸，应当用笑脸换取顾客荷包里的钞票。对于一个十三四岁的孩子来说，内心不想笑，硬叫陪个笑脸是很不容易的事。但为了要活下去，我只好强迫自己学会那种皮笑肉不笑的“生意面孔”。
    后来，我在社会上翻来滚去地爬上了知识分子的阶层。从卖货的人变成买货的人了。从那时候起，我一看到商人的笑脸就有反感，我内心这样想：别来这一套，当年我笑得比你还美哩！
    解放后，合作社、公私合营商店、国营商店的售货员，再不那样虚伪了。然而，不少人招待顾客时大有“愿买者买，不愿买则罢”的劲头，这也使人感到不舒服。
    自从天桥百货商店提出打破陈规大跃进的口号，并且在服务态度上大大改进而博得好评后，在商业上突然地出现了一番新气象。不论是国营商店或公私合营商店的售货员，对顾客都变得笑容可掬了。他们的笑脸不是装出来的，而是真正发自内心的深处。因为他们明白了他们办的是为人民服务、为社会主义积累资金的大事。我以为所有人民的勤务员，都应该向他们学习，为了社会主义而向人民陪出笑脸来。
