Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 3rd: A decision was made at the Shanxi Province Yellow River and Fen River Greening Mobilization Meeting, which closed on the 2nd, to mobilize one million young people and farmers to green the banks of the Yellow River and Fen River within Shanxi Province before the end of March.

The Yellow River flows for more than 1,700 *li* within Shanxi Province, and the main tributary of the Yellow River, the Fen River, also has more than 1,300 *li* of embankments. In order to eliminate the scourge of these two rivers as soon as possible and maintain soil and water along the banks, the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Department and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly convened a greening mobilization meeting for thirty-six counties and cities along the Yellow River and Fen River. The meeting decided to mobilize one million young people and farmers to form four thousand shock brigades to carry out a "half-month preparation, seven-day crash, three-day mop-up" greening campaign from March 5 to the end of the month. They will create 30-meter-wide shelterbelts on more than 70,000 *mu* of barren beaches on the east bank of the Yellow River and both banks of the Fen River, planting more than 100 million trees.

    山西百万青少年开展突击运动
    一月内绿化黄河汾河
    据新华社太原3日电　动员一百万青少年和农民在3月底以前绿化山西省境内黄河和汾河沿岸，这是2日闭幕的山西省绿化黄河、汾河进军会议作出的决定。
    黄河在山西省境内全长一千七百多里，黄河的主要支流——汾河也有一千三百多里长的堤岸。为了尽快地消灭这两条河流的水患，保持沿岸水土，山西省林业部门和共青团山西省委联合召开了沿黄河、汾河三十六个县、市的绿化进军会议。会议决定动员百万青少年和农民，组成四千个突击团，从3月5日到月底开展“半月准备、七天突击、三天扫尾”的绿化运动，在黄河东岸和汾河两岸的七万多亩荒滩上，营造起三十公尺宽的护岸林带，共植树一亿多株。
