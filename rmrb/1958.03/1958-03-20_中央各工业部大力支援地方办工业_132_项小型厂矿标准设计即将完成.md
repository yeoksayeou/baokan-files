Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: The central industrial departments are rushing to produce one hundred and thirty-two standard designs for small factories and mines to support the great development of local industry.

These one hundred and thirty-two standard designs cover a wide range, including ferrous and non-ferrous metal mines and smelters, small coal mines and coal washing plants, chemical fertilizer plants, synthetic petroleum plants, power plants, cement kilns, machinery repair shops, textile printing and dyeing factories, paper mills, rubber factories, as well as dairy powder factories, oil mills, sugar mills, wineries, starch factories, and other agricultural and sideline product processing plants. The scale of these standard designs varies, with the vast majority being suitable for counties, special districts, or districts, townships, and towns below the county level. For example, the seven types of small blast furnaces designed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the largest of which is only 100 cubic meters and produces approximately 40,000 tons of pig iron annually, is suitable for a county to operate. The smallest is only 3 cubic meters, and even a small town has the conditions to run it. The five coal mine shafts of different sizes designed by the Ministry of Coal Industry, the largest of which has an annual output of 210,000 tons and the smallest of which has an output of 30,000 tons, are all mined by drilling and blasting or manual methods.

At present, the design schemes for these one hundred and thirty-two standard designs have been finalized, and the design drawings are planned to be completed before the end of April.

According to the completed standard designs and the finalized schemes, these small factories and mines not only fully consider the possibility of being universally applicable in various localities and being established as simply as possible, but also reserve room for future development. Therefore, initial construction is not only cost-saving but also fast. The cement kiln with an annual output of 30,000 tons designed by the former Ministry of Building Materials Industry can be built in only six to eight months, with an investment of just over one million yuan. The small oil mill designed by the former Ministry of Food Industry with a daily processing capacity of one ton of oilseeds, the main equipment (oil press) weighs only 145 kilograms, and the entire set of equipment occupies only about one square meter. Ordinary temples and civilian houses can be used as factory buildings, so the investment is very small. On average, each factory can be built for only 1,000 yuan, and agricultural production cooperative members can operate it after learning for just one day.

The equipment for these small factories and mines can mostly be manufactured by the machinery factories in various provinces and cities themselves.

    中央各工业部大力支援地方办工业
    132项小型厂矿标准设计即将完成
    据新华社19日讯　中央各工业部门正在赶制一百三十二项小型厂矿的标准设计，以支援地方工业大发展。
    这一百三十二项标准设计包括的范围很广，其中有黑色、有色金属的矿山和冶炼厂、小型煤矿和洗煤厂、化学肥料厂、人造石油厂、发电厂、水泥窑、机械修理厂、纺织印染厂、造纸厂、橡胶厂，以及乳粉厂、榨油厂、制糖厂、酒厂、淀粉厂等等农副业加工厂。这些标准设计的规模有大有小，绝大部分都适宜于县、专区，或县以下的区乡和市镇举办。如冶金工业部设计的七种小高炉，最大的不过一百立方公尺，年产生铁约四万多吨，适宜于一个县举办，最小的只有三立方公尺，一个小市镇也有条件办。煤炭工业部设计的五种大小不同的煤矿矿井，最大的为年产二十一万吨，最小的为三万吨，都是用打眼放炮或手工方法开采的。
    现在，这一百三十二个标准设计方案都已确定，设计图计划在4月底以前赶制出来。
    根据已经完成的标准设计和已确定的方案，这些小型厂矿不仅充分考虑到各地方通用的可能性和尽可能因陋就简地开办起来，同时也为今后的发展保留了余地。因此，初期建设不但投资省，而且时间也快。前建筑材料工业部设计的年产三万吨的水泥窑，也只需六个到八个月就可建成，投资只要一百多万元。前食品工业部设计的日处理一吨油料的小型榨油厂，主要设备（榨油机）的全部重量不过一百四十五公斤，全套设备装配起来也只占地一平方公尺左右，普通的庙宇、民房都可以做厂房，因而投资很少，平均每个厂只需一千元就能办起来，农业生产合作社社员只要学一天就能操作。
    这些小型厂矿的设备，绝大部分可由各省市的机械工厂自己制造。
