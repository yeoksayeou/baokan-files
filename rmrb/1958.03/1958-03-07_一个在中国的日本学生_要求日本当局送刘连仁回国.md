    A Japanese Student in China
    Asks Japanese Authorities to Send Liu Lianren Back to China
    With extremely agitated and heavy feelings, I read the news in your newspaper about Liu Lianren suffering persecution by Japanese militarists. As a Japanese student living and studying in this great country of China, receiving the kind care of the Chinese government and people, I feel unparalleled anger towards the atrocities of Japanese militarists.
    Although Japanese militarists committed countless crimes against China, the Chinese government has been magnanimous, not dwelling on the past, and actively developing friendly relations between China and Japan. Since 1953, China has sent more than 30,000 Japanese nationals back to Japan, and has also released and repatriated more than 1,000 former Japanese soldiers who committed serious crimes of aggression. These actions have deeply moved the Japanese people.
    As a Japanese student living in China, I strongly protest the illegal attempts of the Japanese authorities to make things difficult for Chinese citizen Liu Lianren, and demand that the Japanese government immediately send Liu Lianren back to China with courtesy, and offer him apologies and compensation!

    一个在中国的日本学生
    要求日本当局送刘连仁回国
    我怀着十分激动和沉重的心情，读了贵报关于刘连仁遭受日本军国主义者迫害的消息。作为一个侨居中国的日本学生，在这个伟大的国度里生活和学习，受到中国政府和人民的亲切关怀，我对于日本军国主义者的暴行，更感到无比的愤怒。
    虽然日本军国主义者对中国犯下了无数的罪行，但是，中国政府却宽大为怀，不咎既往，积极发展中日友好关系，从1953年起，中国已经把三万多名日侨送回日本，而且还释放和遣返了一千多名犯过严重侵略罪行的前日本军人。这些行动，使日本人民深为感谢。
    作为一个侨居中国的日本学生，我严重抗议日本当局留难中国公民刘连仁的非法企图，要求日本政府立即礼送刘连仁回国，并向他进行谢罪和赔偿！
