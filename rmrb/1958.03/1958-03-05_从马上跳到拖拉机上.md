Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 3rd: "To basically transfer agricultural operations 'completely from horseback to tractor-back' within the next five years" is a combat slogan of the local industrial departments of Liaoning Province to support the province in realizing agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification.

According to the plan recently formulated by the local industrial departments of Liaoning, in the next five years, local industrial enterprises throughout the province will manufacture 200,000 tractors with 3.5 to 15 horsepower, 400,000 power machines for farmland water conservancy, more than 18,000 three-wheeled vehicles for agricultural transportation needs, and a large number of motor equipment needed for the construction of small rural power stations. In addition, they will also manufacture a large number of agricultural and sideline product processing, plant disease and pest control, well-digging and earth-excavating machinery needed for agricultural mechanization.

After these machines are successively manufactured and sent to the mountains and countryside, they will enable Liaoning Province to realize agricultural mechanization: the area of ​​mechanical耕种 will reach more than 80% of the province's cultivated land, the area of ​​mechanical sowing will reach more than 50%, the area of ​​mechanical mid-cultivation will reach more than 42%, and mechanical harvesting will account for more than 20%; 50% to 60% of the province's townships will achieve electrification. Paddy fields will reach 1 million to 1.2 million hectares, and irrigated land will reach 1.8 million to 2.5 million hectares.

    从马上跳到拖拉机上
    辽宁地方工业在五年内，将为农村制造拖拉机二十万台，动力机械四十万台，三轮汽车一万八千辆，和大量的小型电站设备。
    据新华社沈阳3日电　要在今后五年内使农业作业基本上“从马背上完全转到拖拉机背上”，这是辽宁省地方工业部门为支援全省实现农业机械化、水利化、电气化的一个战斗口号。
    根据辽宁地方工业部门最近制定的规划，五年内全省地方工业企业将制造二十万台三点五马力到十五马力的拖拉机、四十万台用于农田水利化的各种动力机械、一万八千多辆农业运输需要的三轮汽车，并且大量制造建设农村小型电站需要的电机设备。此外，还要大量制造农业机械化所需要的各种农副业产品加工、防除植物病虫害、打井挖土等机械。
    这些机械陆续制成并上山下乡以后，将使辽宁省实现农业机械化：机械耕种面积将达到全省耕地面积80％以上，机械播种面积达到50％以上，机械中耕面积达到42％以上，机械收获占20％以上；全省50％到60％的乡将实现电气化。水田地将达到一百万到一百二十万垧，水灌地将达到一百八十万到二百五十万垧。
