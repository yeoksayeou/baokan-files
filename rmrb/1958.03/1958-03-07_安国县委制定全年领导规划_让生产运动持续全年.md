Xinhua News Agency, Baoding Special Dispatch: The An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province recently formulated a leadership plan deciding that from now until the autumn harvest, they will launch sixteen production movements across the county, focusing on wheat field management, spring planting, and other tasks. Some of these production movements will be carried out independently within a specific period, while others will advance simultaneously. Each production movement is a labor competition. The An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that implementing this leadership method of one movement following another, one high tide leading to the next, can better mobilize cadres throughout the county to overcome bureaucratic styles, boost enthusiasm, enable leading bodies to stand in front of the masses and boldly mobilize them, and ensure the realization of this year's production leap forward plan.

The leadership plan formulated by the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stipulates that before each movement is launched, the county party secretary must go deep into the townships and communes to cultivate an advanced model and organize township and commune cadres from across the county to visit and learn. Township and commune cadres should also learn this leadership method, study technology, cultivate models, and organize sixteen or more visits within the township and commune areas. Sixteen inspections and evaluations should be organized in the township and commune areas within eight months, and several joint inspections and evaluations should be organized throughout the county.

The spirit of this plan of the An'guo County Committee has been conveyed to the townships and county-level departments in recent days. Currently, each township is leading agricultural cooperative members to formulate their own plans for their cooperatives and teams. The An'guo County Committee requires each township and cooperative to convey the spirit of this plan to all members, and to lead members in formulating their own action plans for contributing more labor, investing more capital, accumulating more fertilizer, and offering more ideas for achieving a production leap forward, which will then be inspected during evaluations. County-level departments are also formulating their work plans for the year according to the spirit of the plan, actively participating in and supporting this great leap forward in production.

According to the existing experience of the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, sustaining production movements one after another throughout the year has the following benefits: First, it is easier for cadres to break with conventions, boost enthusiasm, and strive for the top. Second, continuous movements can maintain the sustained revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Since last autumn, An'guo County has carried out five movements. Through continuous evaluation and commendation, all 100,000 laborers in the county have consistently maintained full attendance for three months. In addition, the past intermittent state of production has also changed. Third, continuous movements can also improve labor efficiency. Since the county launched various movements after the autumn harvest last year, the average male full laborer has worked about eighty labor days, and the work points earned in three months are almost equal to half a year last year. Fourth, continuous movements, wave after wave, constantly improve the thinking of cadres and the masses, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the backward catch up. According to statistics, in the recent three months of movements, four backward townships, more than twenty backward villages, and hundreds of backward production teams in the county have changed their original appearance.

According to the experience of the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, when implementing this leadership method, two deviations should be noted: First, formalism may appear in the movement. Second, due to high demands and large tasks, there may be a tendency to commandism. The An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken measures to correct and prevent these two deviations in a timely manner.

The An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to sustain the movement throughout the year is formulated based on past experience. Last year, the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched five production movements, overcame the right-leaning tendencies at the time, boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses, and increased the county's grain yield per mu to more than 464 jin, achieving the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule. After the autumn harvest last year, the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched production movements such as autumn plowing, watering wheat, winter irrigation, turning the land, and water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, which sustained the high tide for three months, and the county saw an unprecedentedly high production enthusiasm.

    安国县委制定全年领导规划
    让生产运动持续全年
    本报特约新华社保定专稿  中共河北省安国县委最近制订的领导规划决定，从现在起到秋收后的八个月中，要在全县开展十六项以麦田管理、春耕播种等为内容的生产运动。这些生产运动有的在一个时期内单独开展，有些是在同一时期内齐头并进。每一项生产运动都是一次劳动竞赛。中共安国县委认为，实现这种运动接着运动、高潮连着高潮的领导方法，可以更好地动员全县干部打掉官风、鼓起干劲，领导机关就能站在群众前面放手发动群众，保证实现今年的生产跃进计划。
    中共安国县委制定的领导规划规定，每次运动开展前，县委书记要深入到乡、社，培养一个先进典型，并且在全县范围内组织乡、社干部来参观、学习。乡、社干部也要学会这种领导方法，学习技术、培养典型，组织十六次以上的乡、社范围的参观。在八个月中要组织十六次乡、社范围的检查、评比，并且要组织几次全县范围的联合检查和评比。
    安国县委的这个规划的精神前些天已传达到乡和县级各部门。现在，各乡正领导农业社社员制订本社、本队的规划。安国县委要求各乡、社要把这个规划的精神传达到全体社员，并且领导社员订出自己为了实现生产大跃进，在什么时候多出几个工、多投多少资、多积几车肥和多献几条计的行动计划，以后在评比当中进行检查。县级各部门也正根据规划的精神，制订今年的工作计划，积极参加并支持这个生产大跃进运动。
    根据中共安国县委已有的经验，把生产运动一个接一个地持续到全年，有以下几种好处：一、干部易于打破常规，鼓起干劲，力争上游。二、接连不断地搞运动，能够保持群众持续高涨的革命热情。安国县从去年秋后曾开展五次运动，经过不断地评比表扬，全县十万名劳动力三个月来始终坚持全勤，此外，过去生产当中的间歇状况也有了改变。三、持续地搞运动，还可以提高劳动效率。这个县从去年秋收后开展起各种运动后，到现在，一般男整劳动力已劳动了八十个左右的劳动日，三个月挣的工几乎顶去年的半年。四、运动连续开展，一波赶一波，一浪接一浪，不断地提高干部群众的思想，可以使先进的更先进，落后的赶上来。据统计，在最近的三个多月的运动中，这个县曾有四个落后乡、二十多个落后村和几百个落后生产队改变了原来的面貌。
    根据中共安国县委的经验，在实现这个领导方法的时候，应该注意两种偏向：第一、是运动当中可能出现形式主义。第二，是由于要求高、任务大，可能发生强迫命令的偏向。对这两种偏向，中共安国县委都采取措施及时作了纠正和防止。
    中共安国县委将运动持续全年的规划，是根据过去的经验制订的。中共安国县委去年曾开展了五次生产运动，克服了当时的右倾逆流，鼓起群众的生产热情，使全县的粮食亩产量达到四百六十四斤多，提前十年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求。去年秋收后，中共安国县委又掀起了秋耕、浇麦、冬灌、翻地和水利积肥等项生产运动，使高潮持续了三个月，全县出现了生产热情空前高涨的局面。
