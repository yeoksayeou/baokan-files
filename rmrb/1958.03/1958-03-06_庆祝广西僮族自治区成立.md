Human beings are inherently equal, as expounded by Marxism-Leninism; though races may differ, human rights are the same. Our motherland established the Republic based on this policy, uniting six hundred million compatriots to promote great unity.

    The outstanding Zhuang people of western Guangdong have thrived here since the Tang Dynasty, inhabiting a place where many ethnic groups live together, opening up the land side by side. Supporting each other in times of hardship, their friendship is as close as glue. Examining the old historical records, the events are still vivid.

    How could the rulers of the past rely on their strength to oppress, thus causing much discord among ethnic groups? Now things are greatly different, with policies being thoroughly implemented. The ethnic family is harmonious and brotherly. Returning the right to autonomy allows all ethnic groups to prosper together. How is this made possible? It is the leadership of the Party.

    Society opens up a new path, and the system is uniquely superior. Through collective wisdom and effort, we are advancing according to plan. Labor unfolds in competition, and struggle creates miracles. We fully exploit the advantages of the land, developing industry and agriculture.

    Cultures are mutually exchanged, and economies are lifted together. Everyone should be responsible for completing the new tasks. The Guangxi region is truly a treasure, rich in resources from the past. All undertakings are being carried out, transforming it into a land of joy. Respecting the friendship of our homeland, how dare we neglect it? Outstanding are the heroes of our time, establishing great achievements and merits.

    庆祝广西僮族自治区成立
    李济深人类本平等，马列阐其则，种族虽有殊，人权无差别。祖国缔共和，本此树政策，合六亿同胞，促进大团结。矫矫粤西僮，唐代此蕃殖，多族杂居处，蓝筚同开辟。患难相扶持，友好如胶漆，稽之旧史乘，事迹尚历历。讵有统治者，恃强肆压迫，遂使民族间，情感多扞格。而今大不同，政策在贯彻，民族大家庭，弟兄敦和辑。归还自治权，各族同兴发，夫何使之然？是党领导力。社会辟前程，制度殊优越，群策群力中，迈进循轨辙。劳动展竞赛，奋斗创奇迹，开掘尽地利，发展工农业。文化互交流，经济相提挈，完成新任务，人人应有责。桂海实奥区，夙昔饶风物，百废行具举，蔚之成乐国。载瞻桑梓谊，敬恭其敢忽，卓哉济时英，宏树功与绩。
