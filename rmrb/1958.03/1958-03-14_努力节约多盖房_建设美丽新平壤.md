    Strive to Save and Build More Houses
    Build a Beautiful New Pyongyang
    This year, the staff of the Pyongyang construction department are facing a major task: according to the original plan, they will build new houses for 17,000 households, the National Liberation Struggle Museum with a total area of more than 8,000 square meters, the Central Library of more than 13,000 square meters, the National Acrobatic Theater and many other large public buildings. In addition, many stadiums, hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and cultural centers are waiting for them to build. The Korean People's Army Memorial Tower and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Memorial Tower are also projects planned for this year.
    The task is huge, but the staff of the Korean construction department have shown unparalleled confidence and drive. They will not only complete the task, but also overfulfill the task and carry out construction in a faster, better and more economical way.
    The staff of the Pyongyang City Urban Design Institute explored potential in many ways. According to the instructions of "design standardization and standardization of accessory materials," they thoroughly eliminated extravagance and waste in the design work. They reduced the cost per square meter by 46% while ensuring the utilization rate of the building. This is a leap forward in design work. After careful calculation of many of their architectural designs, the materials originally planned to build a five-story building can be changed to build a six-story building. In terms of saving building materials, they tried every means to save about half of the national consumption index of cement, steel, wood, iron pipes, gas pipes, and wires, saving the country a lot of funds.
    The staff of several construction companies in Pyongyang are carrying out the conservation movement in full swing. After discussion and trial implementation, the staff of the First Construction Engineering Company decided to reduce the sixteen kinds of accessory materials used in building a house to only five kinds, without damaging the practical effect of the originally designed house. The Second Construction Engineering Company has also greatly tapped its potential and reduced the cost. Now this company has broken through the original plan and is preparing to build 2,246 more houses. Li Heyuan's comprehensive operations team of this company reduced the operation of assembling cement precast components last year from twelve workers to nine. This year, it has been reduced to seven. Recently, due to the successful manufacture of cement precast component regulators, it has been reduced to five workers. This operations team is preparing to save 8,640 man-days, 63 tons of cement, and 18 cubic meters of wood this year.
    This high degree of enthusiasm and creativity of the staff of the Pyongyang construction department has made a major innovation in construction possible. The Korean Cabinet has issued instructions for this purpose, planning to build 10,000 more houses, pave 140,000 square meters more of roads, and build more than 4,300 meters more of sewers by using the surplus manpower and materials in the process of implementing the original plan.
    In order to accelerate the pace of the capital's construction, 15% of all staff in the city's organs will participate in 30 days of voluntary labor each this year. Students in universities and specialized schools, except for graduating students, will also be mobilized to participate in 30 days of construction work.
    The Korean people are determined to build their capital more beautiful and magnificent, and to make it the most modern modern city in the shortest possible time. (Friend)

### 努力节约多盖房  建设美丽新平壤

    努力节约多盖房
    建设美丽新平壤
    今年，平壤市的建筑部门的职工们面临着重大的任务：按照原定计划，他们要为一万七千户人家建筑新住宅，他们要建筑总面积达八千多平方公尺的民族解放斗争博物馆，一万三千多平方公尺的中央图书馆、国立杂技剧场等许多大型公共建筑物。此外，还有不少体育场、医院、学校、幼儿园、文化馆都等待着他们去兴建。朝鲜人民军纪念塔和中国人民志愿军纪念塔也是今年计划内的项目。
    任务很巨大，但是朝鲜的建筑部门的职工却显示了无比的信心和干劲。他们不仅要完成任务，而且要超额完成任务，要多快好省地进行建设。
    平壤市的城市设计研究所工作人员多方挖掘潜力，根据“设计标准化和附属材料规格化”的指示，在设计工作中彻底清除了铺张浪费现象，他们在保证建筑物利用率的条件下使每平方公尺造价降低了46％。这是设计工作的一个跃进。他们的很多建筑设计，经过精打细算，原定建筑五层楼的材料，可改为建筑六层楼。在节约建筑材料方面，他们千方百计地想办法，准备把水泥、钢筋、木材、铁管、瓦斯管、电线节约国家消费指标的一半左右，为国家节省很多资金。
    平壤市的几个建筑工程公司的职工们，更是把节约运动搞得热火朝天。第一建筑工程公司的职工们，经过讨论和试行后，决定把建筑一户住宅使用十六种附属材料减少到只用五种，而且不损害原来设计的住宅的实用效果。第二建筑工程公司也大大地挖掘了潜力，降低了造价，现在这个公司已经突破原定计划，准备多盖住宅二千二百四十六户。这个公司的李河渊综合作业班，去年装配水泥预制构件的作业，由十二个工人减少到九个。今年，又减少到七个。近来由于成功地制造了水泥预制构件调节器，又减少到五个工人。这个作业班准备在今年一年里节约八千六百四十个人工，六十三吨水泥，十八立方公尺木材。
    平壤市建设部门职工们这种高度的积极性和创造性，使建设工作大革新有了可能。朝鲜内阁已为此发出指示，计划在执行原定计划的过程中用节余的人力和物力多建筑一万户的住宅，多铺设十四万平方公尺的公路，多修建四千三百多公尺的下水道。
    为了加速首都的建设的步伐，市内各机关全体工作人员的15％，将在今年内各参加三十天的义务劳动。各大学和专科学校的学生，应届毕业生除外，也将动员参加三十天的建设工作。
    朝鲜人民决心要把他们的首都建设得更加美丽，更加雄伟，要使它在最短时间内成为最新式的现代大城市。（友）
