Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 13th: The Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has revised its production and exploration plans for this year, striving for a great leap forward in Xinjiang's petroleum industry.

This year, Xinjiang's petroleum drilling footage is planned to be equivalent to the total during the entire First Five-Year Plan period, and crude oil production is also close to the total of the past five years, an increase of about 20% compared to the plan set at the beginning of the year. The crude oil output of the Karamay mining area this year will increase by one and a half times compared to last year's trial production.

This year, the scale of petroleum industrial construction and production in the Xinjiang region is the largest in history. In order to rapidly explore the discovered oilfields and open up new oilfields, in addition to continuing drilling in the Karamay Oilfield this year, six new exploration areas will be opened up in the most promising oil-bearing areas of the Junggar Basin and Turpan Basin to find new oilfields. In addition, geological data will be provided this year for future drilling in the Tarim oilfields.

The Karamay Oilfield will officially start producing crude oil this year, so a series of large-scale oilfield constructions, oil pipelines, and expansion of refining equipment will be started. A 147-kilometer-long oil pipeline will be built from Karamay to Dushanzi. After that, the crude oil from Karamay can be continuously transported to the Dushanzi Refinery. The Dushanzi Refinery will also be expanded again this year. A thermal power plant in Dushanzi will also be built at the same time as the refinery. These large-scale projects will all start construction in the second quarter.

This newspaper, Chengdu, 13th: The Longnüsi petroleum exploration area, spanning Wusheng and Yuechi counties in Sichuan Province, had a well gush a large amount of black oil at 4:00 am on March 10th. In just a few minutes, more than three tons of oil gushed out, with the height of the crude oil exceeding three meters above the drilling rig. From 5:00 am to 5:00 pm on the 11th, the exploration area workers opened the wellhead every fifteen minutes to release oil in order to assess the oil production of the well. During this time, more than nine tons of oil were retrieved from the ground. On the 12th, the well was released for forty minutes, producing twenty-five tons of oil.

Since drilling began in the Longnüsi exploration area last September, almost every exploratory well has shown signs of oil, and some have even gushed oil. The recent gushing of large amounts of oil from this well has finally confirmed that the Longnüsi oil structure has industrial exploitation value.

The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau has now decided to produce crude oil in this structural area this year, and the workers are actively preparing for oil testing in order to further explore the oil reserves of this structure.

    醒来吧，沉睡万年的石油
    克拉玛依油田今年正式开采
    四川省龙女寺探井喷出原油
    据新华社乌鲁木齐13日电  新疆石油管理局重新修订今年生产和探勘计划。争取新疆石油工业大跃进。
    今年新疆石油钻探进尺计划相当于第一个五年计划期间的总和，原油生产也接近过去五年的总和，比年初所订计划提高了20％左右。克拉玛依矿区今年的原油产量将比去年试采原油量增加一倍半。
    今年新疆地区的石油工业基本建设和生产规模是历年来最大的一年。为了迅速探明已发现的油田和开辟新油田，今年除继续在克拉玛依油田钻探外，还将在准噶尔盆地、吐鲁番盆地最有含油远景的地区开辟六个新探区，找寻新油田。另外，今年还要为今后钻探塔里木石油提供地质资料。
    克拉玛依油田今年正式开采原油，因此要动工兴建一系列规模宏大的油田建设、输油管线和扩建炼油设备。从克拉玛依到独山子要修一条长达一百四十七公里的输油管线。以后克拉玛依的原油就可一直输送到独山子炼油厂。独山子炼油厂今年也将再次扩建。和炼油厂同时兴建的还有独山子的一座热电站。这些规模庞大的工程，都将在第二季度陆续开工。
    本报成都13日电  横跨四川省武胜、岳池两县的龙女寺石油探区，在3月10日早晨四时有一口探井喷出了大量的黑色石油，只几分钟内就有三吨多，原油喷出的高度超过钻机台三公尺以上。从11日上午五点到下午五点的十二小时内，探区职工为了鉴定这口探井的产油情况，每隔十五分钟打开井口，放喷一次，这段时间又从地上捞得九吨多石油。12日放喷了四十分钟，出油二十五吨。
    龙女寺探区从去年9月开始钻探以来，几乎每口探井都有石油显示，有的并且喷出过石油。最近这口探井大量石油的喷出，已经最后证实了龙女寺石油构造具有工业开采价值。
    现在四川石油勘探局已决定今年在这个构造的区域内生产原油，职工们正在积极准备试油工作，以便进一步探清这个构造的储油量。
