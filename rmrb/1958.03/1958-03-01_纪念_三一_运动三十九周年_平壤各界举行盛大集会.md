Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 28th. A grand meeting was held in the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang tonight by more than 800 people from all walks of life to commemorate the 39th anniversary of the "March 1st" Movement, a famous anti-Japanese imperialist colonial rule movement in modern Korean history.

Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Deputy Prime Ministers of the Cabinet Hong Myung-hee, Jung Il-yong, Park Ui-wan, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ae, Kim Chang-man and other party and government leaders, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to Korea, attended the memorial meeting.

Korean Deputy Prime Minister Kim Il said at the meeting that inspired by the October Revolution, the Korean people once carried out the "March 1st" Movement's anti-imperialist struggle, giving a heavy blow to Japanese imperialism. Through this movement, the national and class consciousness of the Korean people was raised, and the national liberation struggle of Korea was promoted. He also said that commemorating the "March 1st" Movement today is of particular significance. The joint statement recently issued by the Chinese and Korean governments has opened up a new situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The US troops that threaten peace in Korea and the Far East and hinder the peaceful reunification of Korea should immediately withdraw from South Korea.

The "March 1st" Movement took place on March 1, 1919. On that day, more than 300,000 workers, students, and citizens in Seoul held anti-Japanese demonstrations. Subsequently, the movement spread to the entire Korean peninsula, with a total of more than 2 million participants.

    纪念“三一”运动三十九周年
    平壤各界举行盛大集会
    新华社平壤28日电　平壤市各界八百多人今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场举行了盛大集会，纪念朝鲜近代史上著名的反对日本帝国主义殖民统治的“三·一”运动三十九周年。
    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健、内阁副首相洪命熹、郑一龙、朴义琓、劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、金昌满等党政领导人以及各国驻朝鲜的外交使节参加了这个纪念会。
    朝鲜内阁副首相金一在大会上说，在十月革命的鼓舞下，朝鲜人民曾经进行了“三·一”运动反帝斗争，给予日本帝国主义以沉重的打击。通过这一运动，提高了朝鲜人民的民族觉悟和阶级觉悟，促进了朝鲜的民族解放斗争。他又说，今天纪念“三·一”运动，有特别重大的意义。朝中两国政府最近发表的联合声明，为和平解决朝鲜问题打开了新的局面。威胁着朝鲜和远东和平、并且阻挠着朝鲜和平统一的美国军队应该立即从南朝鲜撤出。
      “三·一”运动发生在1919年3月1日。那一天，汉城的工人、学生和市民等三十多万人举行了反日示威游行。接着，这一运动扩展到朝鲜全国，参加的共有二百多万人。
