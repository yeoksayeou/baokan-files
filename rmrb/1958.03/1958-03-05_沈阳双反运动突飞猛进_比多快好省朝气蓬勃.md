    Shenyang, March 4 (Report from this newspaper) The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Shenyang City is advancing more rapidly and on a larger scale than before after the Spring Festival. The city's industry, trade, finance, culture, education, and Party and government organs are all involved in this movement. Big-character posters are plastered everywhere in thousands of units, and in some units, the big-character posters hanging in the corridors are blocking the passage. The quality of the big-character posters is also higher than in the past. The units under the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee challenge each other to compete on the number and quality of the big-character posters. Some units guarantee that each person will post at least fifteen high-quality big-character posters. The Tax Bureau, with only eighty staff members, posted six hundred big-character posters in two days. On Sunday, March 2nd, many unit employees did not rest and were thinking about the content of their big-character posters.
    In this new high tide of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement throughout the city, a vigorous spirit of comparing thoughts, comparing styles, comparing to be numerous, fast, good and economical is emerging. Many factory workers have calculated the economic accounts, and also deeply calculated the political and ideological accounts. After calculating the ideological accounts, the employees of the First Machine Tool Plant found the ideological roots of waste, and proposed that this year's planned costs should be reduced by 24.53% compared with last year's actual costs. The design personnel of the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute reviewed their thinking and found that in the past, due to the mentality of wanting new instead of old, and wanting big instead of small, they designed an extra water source well for Shuangyashan. Administrative and management personnel of the Shenyang Department Store No. 1 are preparing to go to the counters to participate in three hours of business every day. Engineers from the Shenyang Chemical Research Institute expressed that they would sweep away pride and extravagance, reduce special research expenses by 27,000 yuan, and add ten new special topics. Some organs that previously considered themselves to be "clean departments" also opposed bureaucratism and extravagance, and found the ideological roots of waste. For example, the Shenyang Municipal Public Security Bureau Fire Department already has a fire command vehicle, but in order to show off, they bought a small car to use as a command vehicle without approval.

    沈阳双反运动突飞猛进
    比多快好省朝气蓬勃
    本报沈阳4日电　沈阳市的反浪费反保守运动，春节后正以比前壮阔得多的声势和规模向前突飞猛进。全市的工业、财贸、文教和党政机关都卷入这个运动，成千单位到处贴满大字报，有些单位悬挂在走廊上的大字报都堵塞了通道。大字报的质量也比过去高。沈阳市人民委员会所属各单位互相挑战，比大字报的数量和质量。有些单位保证每人至少要贴出十五张质量好的大字报。税务局只有八十个工作人员，两天内贴出六百张大字报。3月2日是星期日，很多单位职工都不休息，在思考大字报的内容。
    全市在这次反浪费反保守运动的新高潮中，呈现出一股比思想比作风比多快好省的蓬勃朝气。很多工厂的职工算了经济账，又深入算了政治账和思想账。第一机床厂职工算了思想账以后，找出浪费的思想根源，提出今年计划成本要比去年实际成本降低24.53％。沈阳煤矿设计院设计人员检查思想，发现过去由于要新不要旧、要大不要小的思想作怪，设计双鸭山的水源井多搞了一个。沈阳百货公司第一商店行政管理人员，准备每天走上柜台参加三小时营业。沈阳化工研究院工程师表示要扫尽骄气阔气，缩减专题研究费用二万七千元，增加十个专题的新内容。一些过去自以为是“清水衙门”的机关，也反出了官气阔气，找出浪费的思想根子。例如：沈阳市公安局消防处已有救火指挥车，但为了摆阔气，未经批准买了一辆小轿车当指挥车使用。
