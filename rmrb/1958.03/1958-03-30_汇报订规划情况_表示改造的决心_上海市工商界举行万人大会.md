Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 29th: Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles held a meeting of 14,000 people on the 28th to report to the city's people on the implementation and revision of personal plans and feelings of industrialists and businessmen, and to further express their determination to accelerate self-reform.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, who are in Shanghai, both spoke at the meeting. They said that personal planning is the "key link" to promote the great leap forward of self-reform of industrialists and businessmen. With planning, they can check and compare at any time, and constantly urge themselves to move forward. They encouraged everyone to give their hearts to the Communist Party, listen to Chairman Mao wholeheartedly, and push the self-reform movement of Shanghai industrialists and businessmen to a deeper stage.

Many industrialists and businessmen spoke at the meeting. They mentioned that the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the workers during this period had deeply educated them, and their original personal reform plans had become backward. Cao Shiyu, head of the technical section of the Municipal Medical Equipment Industry Company, read out the contents of his revised plan on the spot. He has signed a contract with two Communist Party cadres in the company to talk to them about his thoughts at any time so as to get their help. He also specifically arranged time for political theory study every day. Ye Mingyuan, private deputy director of Sanyuan Printing Factory, has included the trial production tasks of three new products in his personal plan, including the equipment for manufacturing machine-made paper drums, which is guaranteed to be completed in the third quarter of this year.

Many industrialists and businessmen reported to the conference on their preliminary achievements in implementing personal plans and participating in labor practice. When Mi Zengxiang, private deputy manager of the Municipal Match Plastic Company, formulated his personal plan, he proposed to go deep into the workshop to participate in operations, aiming at his shortcomings of being unwilling to take responsibility when things happened. He said that due to the implementation of this plan, he recently improved the plastic powder beating system, which increased the output by 60%. Wang Youjun, a private person from Hongji Iron Factory, and workers successfully trial-produced a small universal tractor. Party and government officials in Shanghai visited the site to see this new product, which gave him great encouragement. After Liu Peiyuan, a private person in the brewing industry, successfully used bran cakes to make wine, he also proposed to the conference to continue to try to use other substitutes to make white wine and save the country's grain.

At the meeting, industrialists and businessmen proposed to launch collective or personal self-reform friendship competitions with each other. The sixty-three private personnel from three factories including Huafu Gold Pen Factory sent representatives to speak at the meeting. They have decided to carry out a competition of comparing reforms, comparing labor, comparing contributions, and comparing the implementation of plans, conduct regular inspections and evaluations, urge each other, and make progress together. Tang Diyi, private manager of the Municipal Pen Industry Company, and Liu Nianyi, general manager of the Great China Match Company, also proposed at the meeting that they should carry out competitions with each other to see who can reform faster and work better.

    汇报订规划情况　表示改造的决心
    上海市工商界举行万人大会
    新华社上海29日电　上海市工商界一万四千人28日举行大会，向全市人民汇报工商业者执行和修订个人规划的情况和感受，进一步表示他们加速自我改造的决心。
    正在上海的中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培、全国工商联主任委员陈叔通，都到会讲了话。他们说，个人规划是提起工商业者自我改造大跃进的“纲”，有了规划，就可以随时检查和评比，不断督促自己前进。他们勉励大家把心交给共产党，一心一意听毛主席的话，把上海工商业者的自我改造运动推向更深入的阶段。
    许多工商业者在大会上发了言。他们谈到，这一时期职工们的蓬勃的革命干劲使他们深受教育，他们原来制订的个人改造规划已经显得落后。市医疗器械工业公司技术科科长曹时玉，当场宣读了自己增订的规划内容。他已经同公司的两位共产党党员干部签订合同，随时向他们交谈自己的思想情况，以便取得他们的帮助，他还具体安排出每天进行政治理论学习的时间。三元印刷厂私方副厂长叶明远已经把三项新产品的试制任务列入自己的个人规划，其中制造机制纸桶的设备，保证在今年第三季度内完成。
    许多工商业者向大会报告了自己执行个人规划和参加劳动实践后的初步成绩。市火柴塑料公司私方副经理宓增祥制订个人规划时，针对自己遇事不肯负责的缺点，提出深入车间参加操作的办法。他说，由于执行了这一项规划，他最近改进了塑料打粉档车制度，使产量提高60％。宏记铁工厂私方人员王幼君和工人一起试制小型万能拖拉机成功，上海的党和政府负责人都曾到现场参观了这种新产品，使他得到很大的鼓励。酿造业私方人员刘培元用糠饼造酒成功以后，他又向大会提出要继续试用其他代用品制造白酒，节约国家的粮食。
    会上，工商业者纷纷提出要相互展开集体的或个人的自我改造友谊竞赛。华孚金笔厂等三个工厂的六十三个私方人员派代表在会上发言，他们已决定开展比改造、比劳动、比贡献、比执行规划的竞赛，定期进行检查和评比，互相督促，共同跃进。市制笔工业公司私方经理汤蒂因和大中华火柴公司总经理刘念义也在会上提出，他们要相互开展竞赛，看谁改造得更快，劳动得更好。
