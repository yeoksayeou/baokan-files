Brotherly Countries Cultural Life

    "Remote villages quietly slumber..." – This is a line from a poem by a noble Romanian poet describing the countryside of that time. However, the countryside of the Romanian People's Republic has long been greatly changed. Rural life itself is a heroic, vibrant, and happy poem.
    The people's democratic government has brought a rich and prosperous cultural life to the Romanian countryside. Rural libraries currently have 12 million books of various kinds, meaning that each farmer shares one book on average. Clubs, red corners, and reading rooms are also ubiquitous in rural areas, with 14,000 such organizations. Farmers have also established various recreational and entertainment groups. Dance groups, choirs, drama and music groups are not only readily available but also present in every village. In addition to performing regularly in the countryside, they also participate in the annual rural amateur song and dance troupe performances held in Bucharest. Actors from the people will show their skills in the performances.

    每个农民一本书
    “远僻的乡村静静地沉睡着……”——这是旧时代罗马尼亚一位贵族诗人描写当时农村的诗句。但是，现在罗马尼亚人民共和国农村却早已大大改观了。农村生活本身就是一首豪迈的、蓬勃的、幸福的诗。
    人民民主政权给罗马尼亚农村带来了丰富繁荣的文化生活。农村图书馆目前拥有的各种书籍已达一千二百万册，就是说，平均每个农民分享到一册书。俱乐部、红角、阅览室在农村中也到处可见，这类组织已有一万四千个。农民还成立有各种文娱活动小组。舞蹈组、合唱团、戏剧和音乐小组，不仅是应有尽有，而且是村村都有。它们除去经常在农村表演外，每年还参加在布加勒斯特举行的农村业余歌舞团大会演。从人民中来的演员就要在会演中大显一番身手。
