    It's Not About a Shortage of People, It's About Not Eliminating Bureaucratic Work Style
    After the Changzhi Prefecture Timber Company transferred some cadres to lower levels, it abolished two timber purchasing stations. When formulating this year's timber purchasing plan, they emphasized that there were too few purchasing personnel and that the timber purchasing work could not leap forward. After repeated research, they set this year's timber purchasing plan at 3,500 cubic meters, an increase of 340 cubic meters over the actual purchase volume last year. When the leading organization asked them to increase the purchase plan, they requested to expand the establishment and add two purchasing personnel.
    Is it true that the current staff of the Changzhi Prefecture Timber Company is too small? No. The company currently has 48 staff members, of whom 26 are cadres engaged in administrative management, accounting for more than half of the company's total number. These administrative management personnel include three managers, two secretaries, two personnel officers, one clerk, eleven finance and planning personnel, one communication officer, four guards, and two cooks. With such a large proportion of administrative management personnel, why can't two people be transferred to purchasing work? We hope that the leading cadres of this company will thoroughly eliminate bureaucratic airs and stagnation, and transfer the excessive administrative personnel to the purchasing stations.

    不是人少，是官风没打掉
    长治专区木材公司下放一些干部以后，就撤销两个木材收购站。在制定今年的木材收购计划的时候，他们强调收购人员少，木材的收购工作不能跃进。经过再三研究，他们才把今年的木材收购计划定为三千五百立方公尺，比去年实际收购数量增加三百四十立方公尺。领导机关要求他们提高收购计划，他们就要求扩大编制，增加两个收购人员。
    是不是长治专区木材公司现有的人员太少呢？不是。这个公司现有工作人员四十八人，其中做行政管理工作的干部有二十六人，占公司总人数的一半以上。这些行政管理人员包括经理三人，秘书二人，人事干事二人，事务一人，财务计划十一人，通信员一人，警卫四人，炊事员二人。行政管理人员占的比重这样大，为什么不能调两个人做收购工作呢？我们希望这个公司的领导干部彻底打掉官气和暮气，把过多的行政人员调到收购站来。（王震、乃荣）（附图片）
