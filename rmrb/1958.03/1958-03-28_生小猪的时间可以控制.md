    Rare News

    The sows raised by the Yongfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Guanmenkou Township, Shouzhang County, Shandong, now give birth to piglets during the daytime every time. This is because the pig farm's breeders, after more than two years of analysis and comparison, discovered that those sows bred in the morning give birth during the day, while those bred in the afternoon give birth at night. Since the second half of last year, all the cooperative's sows have been bred before 10:00 AM. (Tai Quan)

    生小猪的时间可以控制
    山东寿张县关门口乡永丰农业社饲养的母猪，现在每次生仔猪的时间，都赶到白天来了。这是猪场的饲养员经二年多的分析对照，摸索出凡是上午配种的，都是赶在白天生，凡是下午配种的，都是赶到晚上生。从去年下半年以来，这个社的母猪已一律实行在上午十点前配种。　（台泉）
