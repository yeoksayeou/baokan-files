    Editorial Notes:

    A Wind of Collaboration is Rising
    In this era of the Great Leap Forward, today this department rushes ahead, tomorrow that unit jumps ahead again; individual leaps forward form a situation of comprehensive leaps forward.

    When this department leaps forward, it is impossible not to drive other departments; if this unit wants to leap forward, it is also impossible not to need the collaboration of other departments. If the leading organs can conduct unified planning and comprehensive arrangements for the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward that has already appeared in a region, strengthen the great collaboration of all departments and all aspects, strengthen the planning and regularity of collaboration, strive for the consciousness and initiative of collaboration, expand the scope of collaboration, and adopt diverse forms of collaboration, it will be an extremely powerful promotion measure for carrying out the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

    Taiyuan City convened such a huge collaboration meeting on a city-wide scale, and received very significant results. This is worthy of learning from all over the country. At this collaboration meeting, everyone fully promoted the spirit of socialist collectivism, forming a good atmosphere of everyone working together and supporting each other. "Supporting others is glorious, and departmentalism is shameful" is the new socialist ethos that emerged from this meeting. We hope that this new ethos will rise throughout the country!

    兴起协作之风
    处在这个大跃进的时代，今天这个部门跑到前面去了，明天那个单位又跳到前面去了，各别的跃进形成了全面跃进的局面。
    这个部门跃进了，不可能不带动其他部门；这个单位要跃进也不可能不需其他部门的协作。如果领导机关能够对一个地区已经出现的全面大跃进的形势，进行统一规划和全面安排，加强一切部门一切方面的大协作，加强协作的计划性和经常性，力争协作的自觉性和主动性，扩大协作的范围，采取多种多样的协作形式，对于又多又快又好又省地开展全面大跃进，是一个十分强有力的促进措施。
    太原市召开了这样一个全市规模的巨大的协作会议，收到很显著的效果。这是值得全国各地学习的。在这次协作会议上，大家充分发扬了社会主义的集体主义的精神，形成大家全力合作，互相支援的良好气氛，“支援别人光荣，本位主义可耻”，就是这个会议出现的社会主义新风尚。希望这个新风尚在全国兴起！
