    "Fat Pig Pill" Factory
    The local state-owned Andong Pharmaceutical Factory is producing "Fat Pig Pills" in large quantities. The factory expects to produce 1.5 billion "Fat Pig Pills" this year.
    Fat Pig Pills are suitable for healthy pigs aged six to eight months, weighing over 110 *jin* (approximately 55 kg). Use one pill twice daily, and the fattening goal can be achieved in 40 days. By using Fat Pig Pills, each pig gains 3 to 6 *liang* (approximately 150 - 300 grams) more meat per day than ordinary pigs (in Northeast China, 1 *jin* is 10 *liang*). The cost of medication per pig for 40 days is about 2 *jiao*. The Fat Pig Pills produced by this factory this year can feed 20 million pigs. Calculated with an average weight gain of 20 *jin* per pig, a total of 400 million *jin* of pork can be gained. Calculated at 5 *jiao* per *jin* of pork, this can increase wealth by 200 million *yuan*.
    Establishing a factory with the same capacity as the Andong Pharmaceutical Factory (the Fat Pig Pill production department) requires eleven pill pressing machines, six granulating machines, three mixing machines, one drying room, and 190 workers. If old houses are used as factory buildings, the investment will be about 100,000 *yuan*, and it can be built in four months. (Attached picture)

    “肥猪片”厂
    地方国营安东制药厂，大量生产肥猪片。这个厂预计今年生产十五亿片“肥猪片”。
    肥猪片适用于六至八个月、体重一百一十市斤以上的健康猪。每日用药两次，每次一片，四十天即可达到肥育的目的。使用肥猪片，每头猪每天比一般猪多长三两至六两肉（东北每市斤为十两）。四十天每头猪用药费二角左右。这个厂今年生产的肥猪片能喂两千万头猪。以每头猪平均多长二十市斤计算，总共可以多长四亿市斤猪肉。每斤猪肉按五角计算，即可增加财富二亿元。
    建立一个相当于安东制药厂规模（生产肥猪片部门）能力的工厂，需要打片机（打药片用的机器）十一台，颗粒机六台，混合机三台，干燥室一个，工人一百九十名。如果利用旧房屋做厂房，大约要十万元投资，四个月即可建成。（附图片）
