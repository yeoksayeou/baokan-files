    "March 8th" Production as Usual!
    Dalian-Lushun Female Workers Make Vows
    (Reported by this newspaper) The broad masses of female workers in Dalian-Lushun have decided to break with convention and spend "March 8th" International Women's Day by maintaining production as usual on that day.
    In many factories in Dalian-Lushun, female workers account for a large proportion of the workforce. In the past, every "March 8th," they would routinely take a half-day holiday, which greatly affected the factory's production. For example, the Technical Inspection Section of the Dalian Electric Porcelain Factory has more than 60 female employees. If they all took their usual holiday, the inspection of products and semi-finished products would not be completed, making it impossible to carry out the production of processes such as electrical inspection, assembly, and glazing. Xie Xiuying, the female worker group leader of the Technical Inspection Section, proposed: "Now is the time of the Great Leap Forward in production, the production tasks for the first quarter are very heavy, and there are few working days. We should not rest on 'March 8th,' but work as usual." Her suggestion was supported by more than 200 female employees in the factory, who unanimously expressed that they would not take a holiday on "March 8th," but would create even greater achievements in production to commemorate "March 8th." Sun Guizhen, a female worker at the Dalian Machine Tool Plant, took the initiative to make a suggestion to the factory's female workers' committee: This year's "March 8th" should be spent in a more extraordinary way; we should celebrate "March 8th" with practical actions to show our women's drive in the Great Leap Forward in production. Yu Jinling, a female worker in the casting workshop of the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory, also took the initiative to suggest to Zhang Henglan, the female workers' group leader, that a meeting of all the female workers in the group should be convened to discuss the issue of maintaining production as usual on "March 8th."

    “三八”节照常生产！
    旅大女工立下誓言
    本报讯　旅大市广大女工决定打破常规过“三八”节，在这天照常生产。
    旅大市许多工厂的女工占着很大的比例，过去每逢“三八”节，她们都是照例休假半天，这使得全厂的生产受了很大的影响。像大连电瓷厂技术检查科的女职工有六十多名，如果她们都照例休假，产品和半成品检查不出来，就会使得电检、装配、上釉等工序的生产无法进行。技术检查科的女工组长谢秀英提出：“现在正是生产大跃进的时候，第一季度的生产任务很重，工作日又少，‘三八’节我们应该不休息，照常干活。”她的建议获得全厂二百多名女职工的支持，一致表示“三八”节不休假，要在生产中创造更大的成绩，来纪念“三八”节。大连机床厂女工孙桂珍主动向工厂的女工委员提出建议：今年的“三八”节应该过得不平凡一些，应该以实际行动来庆祝“三八”节，以表示我们妇女在生产大跃进中的干劲。大连工矿车辆厂铸造车间女工于金令也主动向女工组长张恒兰提出建议，要求召集全组女工开个会，讨论“三八”节照常生产的问题。
