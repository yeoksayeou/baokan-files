    Protest Against U.S. Intervention
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The United States and its tool, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, are interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, which has aroused great indignation among the Indonesian people. On March 25th, Jakarta university students held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy, strongly protesting against the U.S.'s actions in supporting the Indonesian rebel group and demanding the abolition of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization! In order to defeat foreign interference and defend independence and sovereignty, the Indonesian people have launched a vigorous struggle.
    The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Jones, pretentiously said that the U.S. has "no intention of interfering" in Indonesia's internal affairs. But people value facts, not empty words. Everyone sees that the U.S.'s intervention in Indonesia has recently become more and more blatant. The U.S. not only uses Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek clique as an important tool of interference, but has also made military activities the main form of interference. According to Indonesian newspapers, when Dulles went to Taiwan not long ago, he even held military meetings with the rebellious former Indonesian Seventh Military Region Commander Sumual and senior military officers of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, plotting to use Taiwan to support the Indonesian rebel group. Now the Indonesian government has confirmed that the weapons airdropped to the rebels in Central Sumatra came from Taiwan. But this is not enough. The U.S. also plans to carry out direct military intervention. On March 22nd, a U.S. Navy spokesman claimed that U.S. warships stationed in Singapore were ready to go to Central Sumatra at any time to "evacuate American citizens," and that aircraft carriers and other ships of the Seventh Fleet would also participate in the operation. Recently, when government forces recovered the city of Payakumbuh, two American journalists were found, holding documents signed by the rebel Simbolon, which further exposed the close connection between the U.S. and the rebel group.
    The matter is very clear: the closer the Indonesian rebel group gets to its final destruction, the more the U.S.'s intervention in Indonesia "reveals its true colors." The U.S. is obviously trying to save the rebels and force the Indonesian government and people to make concessions to the rebels, so that the U.S. can retain a few more positions on Indonesian soil. This arrogant plan of the U.S. makes the Indonesian people see more clearly that their struggle against the rebels is the same thing as the struggle against U.S. intervention. Only by resolutely eliminating rebel activities will it be conducive to opposing foreign interference, and only by resolutely opposing foreign interference can rebel activities be eliminated smoothly.
    Now, the Indonesian government has announced that the U.S. is not allowed to send warships to Central Sumatra to "evacuate American citizens." The Indonesian Foreign Ministry pointed out that sending warships is equivalent to interfering in Indonesia, and therefore it is not allowed. This firm stance shows that the Indonesian government and people are highly vigilant against the U.S.'s interventionist conspiracy and are determined to fight to defend their country's independence and sovereignty.

    抗议美国的干涉活动
    本报评论员
    美国和它操纵的东南亚条约组织对印度尼西亚内政的干涉活动，已经激起印度尼西亚人民的极大愤慨。3月25日，雅加达大学生到美国大使馆门前举行了示威游行，强烈抗议美国支持印度尼西亚叛乱集团的行动，并且要求取消东南亚条约组织！为了打败外国干涉，保卫独立和主权，印度尼西亚人民已经展开轰轰烈烈的斗争。
    美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯装腔作势地说，美国并“无意干预”印度尼西亚内政。但是人们重视的毕竟不是漂亮话，而是事实。谁都看到，美国近来对印度尼西亚的干涉活动是越来越粗暴了。美国不但把台湾蒋介石集团作为干涉的重要工具，而且已经把军事活动作为干涉的主要形式。据印度尼西亚报纸揭露，不久以前杜勒斯到台湾时，竟同叛乱的前印度尼西亚第七军区司令苏穆阿尔和蒋介石集团高级军官举行军事会议，策划了利用台湾支援印度尼西亚叛乱集团的阴谋。现在印度尼西亚政府已经证实，空投给中苏门答腊叛乱分子的武器就是来自台湾的。但是，这还不够。美国还打算直接进行军事干涉。3月22日，美国海军发言人声称，停泊在新加坡的美国军舰随时准备开往中苏门答腊“撤退美国侨民”，而且第七舰队的航空母舰和其他舰只也将参与行动。而最近，在政府军收复不拉拔城的时候，发现了两名美国记者，并且持有叛乱分子西姆波朗签发的文件，这就进一步暴露了美国同叛乱集团之间的密切关联。
    事情非常清楚：印度尼西亚叛乱集团越是临近最后的复灭，美国对印度尼西亚的干涉就越是“图穷而匕首现”。美国显然极力想挽救叛乱分子，并迫使印度尼西亚政府和人民向叛乱分子让步，好让美国在印度尼西亚的土地上多保留几块阵地。美国的这种狂妄的打算，使印度尼西亚人民更清楚地看到，他们反对叛乱分子的斗争同反对美国干涉的斗争是一回事情。只有坚决消灭叛乱活动，才会有利于反对外国干涉，也只有坚决反对外国干涉，才能够顺利地消灭叛乱活动。
    现在，印度尼西亚政府已经宣布不准美国派什么军舰到中苏门答腊去“撤退美国侨民”。印度尼西亚外交部指出，派军舰就等于干涉印度尼西亚，因此这是不能容许的。这种坚定的立场表明了印度尼西亚政府和人民对于美国的干涉阴谋，有着高度的警惕，并且坚决为捍卫自己国家的独立和主权而斗争。
