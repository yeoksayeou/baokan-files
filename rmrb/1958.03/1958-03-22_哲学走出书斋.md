    "Philosophy Steps Out of the Study"
    Chí Liǎozhōu
    Not long ago, the People's Daily published a photo of a philosophy teacher from Renmin University raising pigs in an agricultural cooperative, which aroused much discussion and interest. The Beijing Daily on the 4th of this month also reported that the faculty and students of the Philosophy Department of Peking University have been linked with nearby agricultural cooperatives, and both sides have achieved beneficial results over the past three years. In particular, these philosophers and future philosophers have shed a lot of bookishness in their contact with farmers. Some call this "philosophers stepping out of the study." The practice of philosophers will bring incalculable benefits to the development of philosophy, which is indeed worth learning for those who study philosophy.
    However, this alone isn't enough. In the declaration of the Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries last November, it was specifically pointed out that one of the urgent tasks of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to "apply dialectical materialism in practical work and educate cadres and the broad masses with Marxism-Leninism." We are currently in a situation of a nationwide great leap forward in production. For the great leap forward, an extremely important condition is that our work methods must have a great improvement, with more materialist dialectics and less metaphysical methods. This once again raises an urgent question: materialism and dialectics are not just matters for philosophers, but should become weapons that every revolutionary cadre must master. This means that philosophy must also step out of the study, from the circle of a few philosophers, to the broad cadres and masses.
    Undoubtedly, this is another event with great revolutionary significance. It can be expected that in the future, if on the one hand, more intellectuals, including philosophers, go to production and practical struggles to be tempered and to summarize and generalize the struggle experiences of the people; and on the other hand, cadres and the masses with rich experience in production and class struggles can consciously master Marxist materialism and dialectics, then not only will our revolutionary cause and industrial and agricultural production leap forward faster, but also the philosophical research work itself will achieve a leap forward. Because today, those who can add new weapons to the treasure house of philosophy will certainly not be those armchair philosophers who know nothing about practical life, but those revolutionaries and philosophers who have rich struggle experience and are good at summarizing these experiences.
    Perhaps some people will say: how easy is it to let the broad cadres and masses master materialism and dialectics! Indeed, for centuries, philosophy has not only been monopolized by intellectuals, but even among intellectuals, it seems to be considered an unattainable field of learning. Who has ever seen worker and peasant philosophers? However, on closer reflection, the problem is not so mysterious or too difficult. Because, in essence, philosophy is just a summary and generalization of the most basic knowledge of the class struggle and production struggle of the broad masses of people. In terms of origin, the working masses can be said to be the teachers of philosophers. Although the working people cannot spontaneously become Marxists, because they live in production and practical struggles, they are more likely to accept and understand some basic principles of Marxism compared with those intellectuals who cannot lift a hand or carry a burden and are divorced from reality.
    Moreover, it goes without saying that many senior leading cadres of our Party are good at applying materialist dialectics in practical work. Many other cadres, including grassroots cadres, also often consciously or unconsciously use some basic laws of materialist dialectics: the law of the unity of opposites, the law of quantitative change leading to qualitative change, the law of negation of negation, to carry out work. For example, in grassroots Party organizations, a branch secretary often lists the advantages and disadvantages of the work when reporting on the work. This is the two-point theory, a method of analyzing problems comprehensively. In philosophical terms, it is using the viewpoint of "the unity of opposites" to observe the work process and its results. In practical work, the mass line working method, the free discussion method, the current methods of great airing, great contending, and great debate, as well as breaking through at one point and driving the overall situation, grasping both ends and driving the middle, evaluation, and engaging in experimental fields, etc., are all about establishing opposing sides, so that the opposing two sides compete with each other, and after struggle and transformation, develop forward. We also often say "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit," and often correct mistakes and summarize lessons, turning bad things into good things, which is actually applying the principle of "mutual transformation of contradictions." Furthermore, in order to solve a major problem, after mobilization and full deliberation, a sudden or mass movement method is adopted. Isn't this precisely applying the law of quantitative change to qualitative change? To go further, in the past, in our Party organizations at all levels, when making a report on work tasks, we always started by analyzing the domestic and international situation, and then linked it to the subjective and objective conditions of the unit, and then proposed the work tasks. Although this method had become formulaic party writing in some cases, it was, in any case, an application of the viewpoint and method of dialectical materialism. Unfortunately, this practice is no longer often applied in some areas.
    This shows that in our country, the broad cadres and masses are often applying some basic principles of materialist dialectics. They are all unconscious philosophers. Therefore, if philosophers (including all those with theoretical knowledge) can also go to grassroots work and production labor, and conscientiously summarize various rich experiences of struggle, and help to improve them, then they may well become conscious philosophers. At that time, not only will our cause have a completely new look, but philosophy will also finally and thoroughly step out of the study and gain immeasurable development.

### “哲学走出书斋”

    “哲学走出书斋”
    迟蓼洲
    不久以前，人民日报曾刊载了一幅人民大学一个哲学教员在农业社养猪的照片，引起了许多人的议论和兴趣。这个月4号的北京日报，又报道北京大学哲学系的师生同附近的农业社挂上了钩，三年以来，双方都得到了有益的效果，特别是这些哲学家和未来的哲学家们，在同农民的接触中打掉了不少书生气。有人把这称作：“哲学家走出了书斋”，哲学家的实践，将对哲学的发展带来不可估量的好处，这的确是很值得研究哲学的人学习的。
    可是，事情仅仅这样还是不够的。去年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言里，曾经特别指出，共产党和工人党的迫切任务之一，就是“在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，用马克思列宁主义教育干部和广大群众。”目前我们处在全国生产大跃进的形势之中，为了大跃进，极其重要的一个条件就是我们的工作方法要有一个大进步，多一点唯物辩证法，少一点形而上学的方法。这就再一次提出了一个迫切的问题：唯物主义和辩证法不只是哲学家的事情，而且应当成为每个革命干部必须掌握的武器。这就是说哲学也要走出书斋，从少数哲学家的圈子里，走到广大的干部和群众中去。
    毫无疑问，这又是一个具有伟大革命意义的事情。可以预料，今后如果一方面是更多的知识分子包括哲学家在内，到生产斗争和实际斗争中去经受锻炼，并且去总结概括人民群众的斗争经验；另一方面，有着丰富的生产斗争和阶级斗争经验的干部和群众，又能自觉地掌握了马克思主义唯物论和辩证法，那末不仅我们的革命事业、工农业生产将更快地飞跃前进，哲学研究工作本身，也必将获得跃进。因为，今天能够给哲学宝库增添新武器的，肯定的将不是那些对实际生活毫无所知的书斋哲学家，而是那些拥有丰富斗争经验并善于总结这些经验的革命家和哲学家。
    也许有人会说：让广大干部和群众掌握唯物论、辩证法，谈何容易！的确，多少世纪以来，哲学这门学问不仅为知识分子所独占，就是在知识分子中似乎也认为它是一门高不可攀的学问。更有谁人看见过工人、农民哲学家呢。可是，仔细想想，问题其实又并不奥妙，并不太难。因为说穿了，哲学也不过是总结和概括了广大人民群众的阶级斗争和生产斗争中最基本的知识罢了，从渊源上说，劳动群众倒可说是哲学家们的老师。虽然劳动人民不能自发地成为马克思主义者，但是由于他们生活在生产斗争和实际斗争中，因此比较那些手不能提，肩不能挑，脱离实际的知识分子来说，更容易接受、理解马克思主义的一些基本原理。
    不仅如此，我们党的许多高级领导干部善于在实际工作中运用唯物辩证法，这是不用说的了。其他许多干部包括基层干部在内，也经常在自觉或不自觉地运用着唯物辩证法的一些基本规律：对立统一的规律，量变质变的规律，肯定否定的规律，去进行工作。例如，在党的基层组织里，一个支部书记在报告工作的时候，往往要列举工作中的优点和缺点，这就是两点论，是一种全面地分析问题的方法，如果用哲学术语来说，就是用“对立的统一”的观点来观察工作过程和它的结果。在实际工作中，我们经常采用的群众路线的工作方法、自由讨论的方法，现在的大鸣大放大辩论的方法以及突破一点、带动全面，抓两头带中间，评比，搞试验田的方法等等，就是树立对立面，使对立的两方面，互相较量，经过斗争、转化并且向前发展。我们还经常说“吃一堑长一智”，经常纠正错误、总结教训，变坏事为好事，实际上就是在运用“矛盾的互相转化”的原理。再比如，为着解决一个重大问题，经过动员和充分酝酿以后，采取突击的或者群众运动的方法，这难道不正是运用量变到质变的规律吗？再说远一点，过去在我们各级党的组织里，在做一个有关工作任务的报告的时候，也总是从分析国内外的形势开始，再联系到本单位的主客观条件，然后提出工作任务。这种方法虽然曾经有些流为党八股，但是无论如何，这是一种运用辩证唯物论的观点和方法。可惜的是，这种做法在一些地区里，不再常被应用了。
    这就说明，在我们国家里，广大的干部和群众，都经常地在运用唯物辩证法的一些基本原理，他们都是一些不自觉的哲学家。所以，如果哲学家们（当然还包括一切具有理论知识的人）又都能到基层工作中和生产劳动中去，认真地总结各种丰富的斗争经验，帮助提高他们，那末，他们就完全可能成为自觉的哲学家。那时候，不仅我们的事业将面目全新，哲学也将最后彻底地走出了书斋，获得不可限量的发展。
