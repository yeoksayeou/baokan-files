The representatives of eight major wheat-producing provinces, after visiting the wheat field management in An'guo County, gave the following comment: "The enthusiasm of the upper and lower levels is abundant, the leadership measures are concrete, and there are many methods for managing wheat fields." This comment is very pertinent, and the reasoning is also very important. At present, some places have enthusiasm and targets but lack methods and measures, which is very dangerous. We must be like An'guo, combining enthusiasm with methods and targets with measures, to greatly promote the drive to strive for increased summer production.

An'guo has many methods for managing wheat fields, one of which is to mobilize the masses to focus on both ends: one end is to focus on high-yield fields, and the other end is to focus on low-yield fields. This method is also very important. By grasping these two ends, high-yield fields can be consolidated, and low-yield fields can be upgraded block by block, leading the middle-yield fields to emulate the high-yield fields. In this way, the average per-mu yield target will not be missed, and a great summer harvest will naturally be assured.

    干劲加办法  指标加措施
    八个主要产麦省的代表参观安国县的麦田管理后，下了一个评语：“上下干劲十足，领导措施具体，管理麦田办法很多。”这个评语很中肯，道理也很重要。目前有些地方，有干劲，有指标，却缺乏办法，缺乏措施，这是很危险的。一定要像安国那样，干劲加办法，指标加措施，把争取夏季增产的干劲大大促进一步。
    安国管理麦田的办法很多，其中有一条是发动群众抓两头，一头抓丰产田，一头抓低产田。这条办法也很重要。抓了这两头，让丰产田巩固下来，让低产田块块升级，带动中等田向丰产田看齐。这样，平均亩产量指标就不至于落空，夏季大丰收自然也就有把握了。
