    Recently, purple and green sugarcane in Beijing fruit stores have attracted much attention. I am reminded of a way of eating sugarcane in sugarcane-producing areas such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, which is to put the sugarcane in a sugarcane press and squeeze the juice to drink. There, on the streets, there are stalls or vendors selling sugarcane juice. On the spot, the sugarcane is placed under the pressure plate of the press, the screw rod on top is tightened, and the sugarcane juice flows into the glass along the grooves of the press. As for the color, the Yuan Dynasty poet Hong Xiweng used the line "Spring's end, sugarcane is pressed into juice, its color resembling the light yellow of goslings" to describe it. However, when we eat sugarcane, we generally use a "natural press," that is, we put it in our mouths to chew, drink the juice, and spit out the dregs. Li Shizhen greatly appreciated this method of eating, saying, "It is good to drink sugarcane juice, but it is not as flavorful and lasting as chewing it."
    Generally, sugarcane is not grown from seeds, but the sugarcane stems are cut into small sections six or seven inches long with two nodes, and buried in the soil to germinate and grow. It grows in tropical and subtropical regions. In Asia, China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, and in the Americas, Cuba, are all famous producing areas.
    China has a long history of cultivating sugarcane. In the "Summoning the Soul" chapter of the Chu Ci, there is a sentence: "Stewed turtle and roasted lamb, with Zhe juice." Zhe is sugarcane; Zhe juice is sugarcane juice. It can be seen that as early as 2,300 years ago, the Hunan and Hubei regions of China were already using sugarcane as food. The provinces with the most sugarcane cultivation in China are Taiwan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Fujian. The output of these five provinces accounts for 95% of the total national output.
    In addition to being very rich in sugar, sugarcane also contains protein, fat, carotene, vitamin C, and minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and iron, so it is very nutritious. Besides being used as a beverage, it has always been considered to relieve alcohol. The suburban sacrificial song of the Later Han Dynasty said: "Zhe juice dispels morning drunkenness"; Ji Han's "Southern Grasses and Trees" of the Jin Dynasty also said "Sugarcane can eliminate alcohol"; the Tang Dynasty poet Yuan Zhen wrote "Sugarcane dispels lingering drunkenness, and ghee awakens early sleep"; another Tang Dynasty poet Han Hong also wrote "Adding meals together we love the fatness of the perch, and when sobering up we still love the heat of sugarcane."
    Sugarcane has also been used in medicine for a long time. Tao Hongjing's "Famous Doctors' Records" lists sugarcane as a middle-grade medicine, believing that it has the effect of "lowering qi and harmonizing the center, assisting the spleen's qi, and benefiting the large intestine"; Li Shizhen also said that it can "stop vomiting and hiccups, reverse stomach, and widen the chest." The "Southern Tang Book" once recorded a story about using sugarcane to treat illness: Lu Jiang suffered from malaria and dreamed that a woman in white told him: "Your illness can be cured by eating sugarcane." The next day, he ate sugarcane, and his illness was indeed cured. Malaria is chronic malaria. The dream of the woman in white in the story is obviously a myth and not credible, but the "Compendium of Materia Medica" records that sugarcane can cure malaria. I think this is still worth trying in clinical practice by today's doctors.

    春余话甘蔗
    邓宗禹
    近来北京的水果铺里紫皮和绿皮甘蔗，很引人注目。我想起川、粤、闽、浙等产蔗地区，有一种吃蔗法，是把甘蔗放在压蔗机里榨蔗汁喝。那里的街头，都有出售蔗汁的摊子或担子，当场把甘蔗放在压榨机的压板底下，旋紧上边的螺丝杆，蔗汁就沿着压榨机的沟槽源源流入玻璃杯。那颜色，元朝诗人洪希文曾用“春余甘蔗榨为浆，色弄鹅儿浅浅黄”的诗句来描写。不过我们吃甘蔗，一般都是利用“天然压榨机”，即放在嘴里咬嚼，饮其汁而吐其渣。李时珍就很欣赏这种吃法，他说：“凡蔗榨浆饮固佳，又不若咀嚼之味隽永也。”
    一般种植甘蔗都不用种子，只把甘蔗茎切成六七寸长有两个节的小段，埋在土里就可以发芽生长。它生长在热带和亚热带，亚洲的我国、印度、印度尼西亚、菲律宾和美洲的古巴都是著名的产区。
    我国栽培甘蔗的历史已很悠久。楚辞“招魂”篇里就有这样一句：“臑鼈炮羔，有柘浆些”。柘，就是甘蔗；柘浆也就是蔗浆。可见，远在二千三百年前，我国的湖南湖北地区，就已经用甘蔗作食品。我国栽种甘蔗最多的省份是台湾、广东、四川、广西和福建，这五省的产量共占全国总产量的95％。
    甘蔗除了含有很丰富的糖分以外，还有蛋白质、脂肪、胡萝卜素、丙种维生素，以及钙、磷、铁等矿物质，所以很有营养价值。除了当作饮料，一向还认为可以解酒。后汉的郊祀歌就说：“柘浆析朝酲”；晋代嵇含所著南方草木状里也说“甘蔗可消酒”；唐代诗人元稹诗“甘蔗销残醉，醍醐醒早眠”；唐代另一诗人韩翃的诗里也有“加餐共爱鲈鱼肥，醒酒仍怜甘蔗热”的句子。
    甘蔗入药，也已有很长的历史。陶弘景的名医别录里把甘蔗列为中品，认为它有“下气和中，助脾气，利大阳”的作用；李时珍并说它能“止呕哕反胃，宽胸膈”。用甘蔗医病，南唐书曾记载了一段故事：卢绛得了痁病，梦见一个白衣妇人告诉他：“你的病吃甘蔗就可以好。”第二天他吃了甘蔗，病果然就好了。痁就是慢性疟疾，故事里说的梦见白衣妇人显然是个神话，不足凭信，但甘蔗能治痁疟，在本草纲目里是有记载的，这一点我认为还值得今日医家在临床上试一试。
