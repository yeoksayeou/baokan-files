　　Compared 303 Factories and Mines
　　Calculated 375 Indicators

　　By the end of February, thirty-three of the forty state-owned factories and mines in Beijing had compared 375 technical and economic indicators for 1957 with 303 factories and mines across the country. The comparison revealed that half were at a medium-to-low level. This comparison greatly motivated the broad masses of workers to catch up with the advanced, and they successively formulated great leap forward targets and urgently began to catch up. According to statistics from twenty-eight units, of the 296 leap forward targets set, 85% have already surpassed the leading actual level of brother factories and mines last year or are at a medium-to-high level. Some units have already broken through the leap forward targets.

    比了303个厂矿
    算了375个指标
    到2月底止，北京市四十个国营厂矿企业中，已有三十三个单位同全国各地的三百零三个厂矿企业比较了1957年的三百七十五个技术经济指标。比较的结果有半数居于中下水平。这一比，大大激励了广大职工赶先进的干劲，纷纷订出跃进指标，急起直追。据二十八个单位的统计，在所订出的二百九十六项跃进指标中，有85％已跃居兄弟厂矿去年实际水平的首位或居于中上水平。有的单位现在已经突破了跃进指标。
