Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 13th: A new drug for treating schistosomiasis – oral quinine antimony hydrochloride – has been clinically proven successful. After laboratory verification, of fifteen early-stage schistosomiasis patients, from February 25th to March 11th, in the fifteen days after orally administering thirty-nine grams of quinine antimony hydrochloride, the schistosomiasis eggs in the stool of eleven patients had completely died or been eliminated, and the schistosomiasis eggs in the stool of the other four patients had also begun to deform.

Quinine antimony hydrochloride is a new powdered drug developed by scientific workers at the Fujian Provincial Drug Inspection Institute after numerous research experiments. Approved by the Ministry of Health for clinical trials, according to the original fifteen-day treatment plan, patients were given a certain amount of quinine antimony hydrochloride powder orally each day, and the effect was extremely good. The patients' reactions were milder than with antimony potassium tartrate injections. After taking this medicine, the patients' heart and liver functions were not damaged after fifteen days of electrocardiogram observation and final examination.

    治疗血吸虫病的新药
    口服盐酸奎宁锑剂临床试验成功
    新华社福州13日电  治疗血吸虫病的新药剂——口服盐酸奎宁锑剂，已经临床试验成功。经过化验证明：十五个初期血吸虫病人，从2月25日到3月11日止的十五天中，在口服了三十九克盐酸奎宁锑药剂后，已有十一个病人大便中的血吸虫卵全部死亡或消灭，另外四个病人大便中的血吸虫卵也已开始变形。
    盐酸奎宁锑剂是由福建省药品检验所科学工作者经过多次研究试验制成的一种粉剂新药，经卫生部批准进行临床实验，按原订十五天疗程计划，每天给病人口服一定份量的盐酸奎宁锑粉剂以后，效果极为良好，病人的反应比用酒石酸锑钾针剂治疗来得轻微。病人服这种药后，心脏和肝脏机能在经过十五天的心电图描绘观察和最后检查，也没受到损害。
