    Dire Straits of Unemployed Workers in the United States

    Under the shadow of economic recession, the American working class has suffered deeply. Currently, millions of unemployed American workers and their families are living in dire straits.

    According to "U.S. News & World Report" on March 14th, among the more than five million unemployed workers in the United States, only over three million can receive unemployment benefits from the federal or state governments. These benefits average about thirty dollars per person per week. However, the minimum living expenses for a family of four in the United States is currently five hundred dollars per month.

    As for the other two million unemployed workers who cannot even receive meager relief, their situation is even more tragic. They either rely on their meager savings, borrow from relatives and friends, or beg for alms from so-called charitable organizations. These workers and their families are living a life of hunger and cold, with no guarantee for the future.

    Those unemployed workers who can receive benefits are also constantly worried. Because these benefits cannot be received throughout the year. According to "U.S. News & World Report" statistics, most unemployed workers can only receive benefits for twenty to twenty-six weeks per year. At the same time, each worker's benefits have a certain total limit. After a certain period, his benefits will be exhausted. According to official statistics, by the end of this year, 1.8 million of those currently receiving benefits will have exhausted their benefits. Currently, the number of such unemployed workers is constantly increasing, and more than 100,000 workers have already exhausted their benefits and have begun to rely entirely on borrowing or begging to make a living.

    American unemployed workers and the broad masses of working people struggling on the breadline also face the threat of rising consumer prices. According to "U.S. News & World Report" statistics, from January 1957 to January 1958, the prices of various daily consumer goods increased by an average of 3.6%, and "the prices of daily necessities still tend to rise." In particular, the prices of bread, vegetables, and meat are expected to rise further this year. Under such circumstances, the lives of unemployed workers and the broad masses of working people are deteriorating. (Originally published in "U.S. News & World Report")

### 美国失业工人处境悲惨

    美国失业工人处境悲惨
    在经济衰退的阴影下，美国工人阶级遭到深重的灾难。目前，数百万美国失业工人和他们的家庭生活十分困苦。
    据3月14日“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，在美国五百多万失业工人中，只有三百多万人能领取联邦政府或州政府的失业救济金。这种救济金平均每人每周约三十美元。而目前美国一个四口之家每月的生活费用最低也要五百美元。
    至于连微薄的救济金也领不到的另外二百万失业工人，境况就更加悲惨了。他们或者依赖仅有的一点点积蓄度日，或者向亲友借债，或者求乞于所谓慈善机关的施舍。这些工人和他们的家属度着饥寒交迫、朝不保夕的生活。
    那些能领到救济金的失业工人，也是终日惶惶不安的。因为这种救济金并不是全年都能领到的。据“美国新闻与世界报道“统计，大多数失业工人每年只能领二十至二十六个星期的救济金。同时，每个工人的救济金有一定的总限额，领到一定时期后，他的救济金就领完了。据官方统计，到今年年底，在现在领救济金的人中，将有一百八十万人领完了他们的救济金。目前，这类失业工人正在不断增加，现在已有十多万工人已领完了他们的救济金，开始完全依靠借贷或求乞度日。
    挣扎在饥饿线上的美国失业工人和广大的劳动人民，还面临着消费品不断上涨的威胁。据“美国新闻与世界报道”统计，从1957年1月到1958年1月，各种日用消费品的价格平均上涨了3.6％，而且，“日用必需品的价格仍有上涨的趋势。”特别是面包、蔬菜和肉类的价格，估计在今年还要上涨。在这种情况下，失业工人和广大劳动人民的生活正在日益恶化。（原载“美国新闻与世界报道”）
