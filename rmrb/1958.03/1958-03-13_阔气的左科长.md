    The North China Metal Structure Factory has a large pit for storing scrap steel. On February 9th, Section Chief Zuo of the Supply and Marketing Section, upon hearing that Deputy Mayor Wang of Beijing was coming to inspect sanitation, hurriedly ordered people to bring several truckloads of yellow earth and instructed the workers to fill the pit. The workers felt it was a pity to bury the large pile of scrap steel underground and suggested clearing it out before filling the pit. However, Section Chief Zuo, fearing there wouldn't be enough time, rejected the workers' suggestion, saying, "Scrap steel isn't worth much, it's easier to just bury it." He insisted that the workers fill the pit. The workers were very angry at the time. The next day, regardless of Section Chief Zuo's opposition, they dug out about 10,000 catties of scrap steel and iron from the pit, including a large number of usable channel steel, rails, angle iron, and other materials.

    In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, everyone is opposing bureaucracy, lethargy, arrogance, and extravagance. When will Section Chief Zuos like him buck up?

    阔气的左科长
    华北金属结构工厂有个堆放废钢铁的大坑。2月9日，供销科左科长听说北京市王副市长要来检查卫生，就匆匆忙忙地叫人拉来几卡车黄土，叫工人们把大坑填平。工人们觉得把大堆废钢铁埋在地下很可惜，建议先把它们清理出来再填土。但是，左科长却怕时间来不及，不接受工人的建议，说：“废钢废铁值不了多少钱，不如埋掉省事。”他非要工人们把坑填平不可。工人们当时非常气愤，第二天，不顾左科长的反对，从坑内挖出来一万斤左右的废钢废铁，其中有大批可用的槽钢、道轨、角铁等器材。
    在反浪费反保守运动中，人人都在反官风、暮气、骄气、阔气，左科长们什么时候才振作起来？
