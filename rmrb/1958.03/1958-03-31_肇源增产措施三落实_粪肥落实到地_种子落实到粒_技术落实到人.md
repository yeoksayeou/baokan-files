    Zhaoyuan Implements Three Measures to Increase Production
    Manure Applied to Land, Seeds Applied to Each Grain, Technology Applied to Each Person
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 30th dispatch) The production leap forward plan of Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has been implemented in every township, every commune, every production team, and every commune member. Zhaoyuan County plans to achieve 6,000 jin of grain per hectare this year, reaching the target of 400 jin of grain per mu stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program.
    The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee felt that not only should there be a plan, but there should also be specific methods. Therefore, it proposed several specific measures to increase production: First, manure should be applied to the land. Not only should the total amount of manure be grasped, but it should also be calculated whether the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu can reach the plan, and how much is delivered to the land? Second, seeds should be applied to each grain. Every grain of seed must be a good seed. Now all the seeds in the county have been carefully selected. Not only are large soybeans selected by grain, but even millet has been selected by grain in some places. Third, technology should be applied to each person. This is a particularly important key. Each agricultural commune conducts mass evaluation according to the strengths of each member, with personal consent, to be responsible for planting, plowing, compacting... and other tasks. At the same time, the whole county is also conducting technical training, so that more than 83,000 male and female commune members can learn the scientific technology of cultivating six major crops. In order to give play to the enthusiasm of farmers for production, all agricultural communes in the county will adopt the method of paying labor remuneration according to output. That is, "contract land by group, contract trees by land, contract production by tree, and pay remuneration by production." The excess production will be given double work points, and if the production is reduced due to insufficient number of trees or the output per tree does not meet the standard, work points will be deducted proportionally. This prevents the phenomenon of only paying attention to work points and not paying attention to quality.

    肇源增产措施三落实
    粪肥落实到地　种子落实到粒　技术落实到人
    本报哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省肇源县的生产跃进计划，已经落实到每一个乡，每一个社，每一个生产队，每一个社员。肇源县今年计划实现每公顷产粮六千斤，达到农业生产发展纲要所规定亩产粮食四百斤的指标。
    肇源县委感到，不但要有计划，还需要有具体办法。因此提出了几项具体的增产措施即：一、粪肥应落实到地。粪肥不仅要掌握总数量，还要算出平均每亩地的施肥量是不是能达到计划，送到地里的有多少？二、种子落实到粒。每一粒种子都要是好种子。现在全县的种子都经过精选，不但大粒的大豆是粒选的，有的连糜子也做了粒选。三、技术落实到人。这是一个特别重要的关键。各农业社根据每个社员的特长，进行群众评选，个人同意，担负点种、扶犁、镇压……等工作。与此同时，全县还进行技术训练，使八万三千多名男女社员，学习到六大作物栽培的科学技术。为了发挥农民的生产积极性，全县农业社都要采取按产量付给劳动报酬的办法。就是“按组包地，按地包棵，按棵包产，按产付酬”。超产的部分，给双工，因棵数不够和每棵产量达不到标准减产的，按比例扣工分。这样就防止了只顾工分不顾质量的现象发生。
