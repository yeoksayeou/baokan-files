Good Technique, Poor Stamina
——Soviet Football Team Head Coach Talks About Impressions of Chinese Football

“Chinese football players have technique but lack stamina”—this is the assessment that Comrade Katsalin, head coach of the Soviet national football team, made of the current state of Chinese football at a symposium before ending his visit to China.

At the meeting, Katsalin said that Chinese athletes are not slow, are relatively flexible, and jump well, but lack endurance. Taking the Beijing team as an example, they have good technique, but due to insufficient endurance, they cannot persist in the second half, and their speed is therefore reduced. Other teams have similar situations. He pointed out that this is due to improper training methods, mainly manifested in the poor combination of physical training and technical training.

In terms of technical training, Katsalin believes that Chinese athletes' techniques are all good, and the level of individual players is not lower than that of Soviet players, but shooting skills are not satisfactory enough.

He also believes that the parallel three-defender zone defense tactics commonly used by Chinese teams, although they easily create offside opportunities for the opponent, are also easily broken through by the opponent for goal attempts. Especially against figures like Semliang and Bubkin of the Soviet team who are good at threading needles, this tactic is not very effective. He also believes that the Chinese team's play style of timely siege by forwards is conducive to defense but slows down the speed of attack. In terms of offense, Katsalin pointed out that the attacking power of Chinese teams is generally good, especially the Beijing team and the "August 1st" team, but they all lack sharpness, which is greatly related to insufficient physical strength affecting speed. Although Chinese teams have a strong ability to control the midfield, they dribble too much, which is conducive to the opponent's timely deployment of defense. Chinese teams' midfielders transition from defense to attack quickly, but they lack the power to make further powerful assists.

Talking about the sportsmanship and willpower of Chinese athletes, Katsalin felt very satisfied. Katsalin pointed out that the future of Chinese football is optimistic. As long as the training methods are properly arranged, and technical training, tactical training, and physical training are closely integrated, it will definitely reach a higher level. He also said: I heard that Chinese football players are striving to catch up with the world level within ten years. This seems a bit too conservative. If the training is appropriate, it can catch up with the world level in two or three years.

    技术不错，体力不佳
    ——苏联足球队总教练谈对中国足球运动的观感
    “中国足球运动员有技术、无体力”——这是苏联国家足球队总教练卡察林同志，在结束中国访问前的一个座谈会上，对中国足球现貌所作的评价。
    卡察林在会上说，中国运动员速度不慢、且较灵活，弹跳也好，但耐力差。以北京队为例，他们技术不错，但由于耐力不够，下半场就无法坚持，速度因此减低。其他球队也有类似情况。他指出，这是由于训练方法欠妥所致，主要表现在体力训练和技术训练配合的不好。
    在技术训练方面，卡察林认为中国运动员的技术都不错，个别选手的水平并不比苏联球员低，但是射门技术不够满意。
    他还认为，中国球队普遍采用的并排三后卫制区域防守战术，虽易制造对方越位机会，但也易被对方突破而攻门。特别是对像苏联队谢孟良、布布金那样善于穿针引线的人物，这种战术起作用就不很大。他还认为，中国球队前锋及时围守的打法，虽有利于防守，但减慢了进攻速度。在进攻方面，卡察林指出，中国球队进攻力量都还不错，尤其是北京队和“八一”队，但是都欠锐利，这与体力不足而影响速度有极大关系。中国球队虽然控制中场的能力较强，但盘带过多，这就会有利于对方及时布防。中国球队前卫转守为攻较快，但再进一步作有力助攻就显得缺少力量。
    谈到中国运动员的运动道德和意志品质，卡察林感到非常满意。卡察林指出，中国足球运动的前途是乐观的，只要把训练方法适当安排，将技术训练、战术训练和体力训练都紧密结合起来，那么一定还会达到更高水平。他并说：听说中国足球选手争取在十年内赶上世界水平，这似乎太保守了一些，如果训练恰当的话，二、三年内就可赶上世界水平的。
