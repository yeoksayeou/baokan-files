    Celebrating the Establishment of the Autonomous Region

    Editor:
    When I saw the news in the newspaper that the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was officially established on March 5th, I was extremely happy.

    My home is in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County. Before liberation, my father, older brother, and older sister all worked as hired laborers for landlords, and my mother also did short-term work for landlords. The family worked desperately, but still couldn't get enough to eat or wear. When I was five years old, my father died from overwork, and the family's life became even more desperate.

    After liberation, the poor were emancipated. After the land reform, especially after the agricultural cooperativization, our lives changed drastically, and my mother's face often showed a smile. To defend our victorious achievements, my mother even sent me to join the army in 1956.

    The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will bring greater happiness to all ethnic groups. I promise to study hard, improve my military science and technology, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

### 喜庆自治区成立

    喜庆自治区成立编辑同志：
    当在报纸上看到广西僮族自治区在3月5日正式成立的消息后，真使我感到万分的高兴。
    我的家在三江侗族自治县。解放前，我的父亲、哥哥和姐姐都给地主当长工，妈妈也给地主做短工。一家人拼命劳动，还是吃不饱穿不暖。我五岁那年，父亲由于劳累过度死了，一家人的生活更陷入绝境。
    解放后，穷人翻了身，土改以后，特别是农业合作化以后，生活大变了，妈妈的脸上也经常浮现着笑容。为了保卫我们的胜利果实，1956年妈妈还送我参了军。
    广西僮族自治区的成立，将给各族人民带来更大的幸福。我保证努力学习，提高军事科学技术，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
    邕宁军分区侗族战士　唐远荣
