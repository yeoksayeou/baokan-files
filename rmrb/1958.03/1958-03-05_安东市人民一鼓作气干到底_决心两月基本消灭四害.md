　　Shenyang Electric News: The people of Anshan City are determined to go all out to eliminate the four pests in the next two months. On March 1st, the city began a general mobilization, with 300,000 troops dedicated to eliminating the four pests turning out en masse, determined to work hard for seven days and nights to achieve eight cleanlinesses (clean indoor furniture, clean kitchen utensils, clean courtyards, clean streets and alleys, clean toilets, personal cleanliness, clean bedding, and clean public places), so that the city will become a civilized city free of the four pests, with everyone hygienic, every family clean, and everything tidy within two months. In January of this year, the people of Anshan City launched a campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, quickly setting off a climax. In one and a half months, more than 250,000 rats and sparrows were eliminated, and more than 39,000 tons of garbage were removed. More than 60% of the city's units and residents have basically met the standards of hygiene, and many advanced units with "two freedoms" and "four freedoms" have emerged. Due to the increasing revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, the city's original three-year plan to eliminate the four pests has become very conservative. The city has revised the original plan for the fourth time and decided to eliminate the four pests in two months. Anshan City's leap forward plan to eliminate the four pests has attracted great attention, and some city leaders are considering whether they can ride the waves like Anshan City and eliminate the four pests in two or three months.

    安东市人民一鼓作气干到底
    决心两月基本消灭四害
    本报沈阳电　安东市人民要一鼓作气干到底，决心在今后两个月内消灭四害。1日全市开始总动员，三十万除四害大军纷纷出动，要苦战七个昼夜，做到八洁（室内家具洁、厨房食具洁、院庭洁、街巷洁、厕所洁、个人洁、被褥洁和公共场所洁），使得全市在两个月内就变成人人卫生家家清洁处处整齐的文明的四无城。今年1月，安东市人民展开除四害讲卫生运动，很快就掀起高潮。一个半月时间就消灭鼠雀二十五万多只，清除垃圾三万九千多吨。全市60％以上的单位和居民都基本上达到卫生合格的标准，出现了很多“二无”“四无”的先进单位。由于群众革命干劲日益高涨，全市原订三年消灭四害的计划已显得很保守。该市已第四次修改原计划，决定两个月除尽四害。安东市除四害的跃进计划，引起人们极大的注意，有些城市负责人正在考虑能不能像安东市一样乘风破浪，在两三个月内除尽四害。
