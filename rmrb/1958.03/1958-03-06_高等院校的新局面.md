    New Situation in Higher Education Institutions
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    An upsurge of anti-waste and anti-conservatism has formed in many higher education institutions. Within two days, the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration posted more than 50,000 big-character posters, and the Beijing Institute of Technology posted more than 26,000 big-character posters in one day. This is another new situation in higher education units.
    Although the steps and methods of the "double anti" are different in various enterprises, organs, and institutions across the country, the foundation is based on big-character posters. Naturally, higher education institutions should be no exception. The more big-character posters, the better things will be handled. On the one hand, big-character posters fully express the emotions of the masses in the movement; without mass movements, it is often difficult to move certain intellectuals. On the other hand, big-character posters sharply raise questions of right and wrong. With right and wrong, there can be debate, which can promote the resolution of problems. Therefore, we must fully value the new situation in higher education institutions where thousands of big-character posters appear in one day.
    The big-character posters in higher education institutions involve everything from school life and study to educational policies and leadership style. Many schools have also raised a most basic question: If the students cultivated are not both red and expert, it is the greatest waste. This question is very well raised. Cultivating talents who are both red and expert is the basic task of the "double anti" movement in higher education institutions. It is hoped that higher education institutions can thoroughly solve this problem in the "double anti" movement.
    At present, the development of the "double anti" movement in higher education institutions is still uneven. The movement in many schools has developed in depth, and those lagging behind need to quickly catch up. School leaders should continue to boldly mobilize the masses and encourage them to speak out freely. However, at the same time, they must also be good at seriously studying and analyzing the various opinions put forward by the masses with a clear head when the masses are speaking out freely. First of all, they must grasp the major issues that the masses urgently demand to be resolved. For some issues that need to be discussed, they should guide the masses to actively debate, clarify right and wrong, and put forward suggestions for improvement. For those issues where opinions are consistent and can be changed immediately, they should be changed immediately. This will more forcefully encourage the masses and deepen the movement step by step. It is hoped that through this "double anti" movement, the struggle between the two roads of running schools and the two methods of running schools in higher education institutions will be thoroughly unfolded, various backward and conservative phenomena will be broken, and higher education will achieve a great leap forward.

    高等院校的新局面
    本报评论员
    反浪费反保守高潮已在许多高等学校形成。北京地质勘探学院两天之内就贴出了五万多张大字报，北京工业学院一天之内就贴出两万六千多张大字报，这是高等教育单位的又一个新局面。
    全国各地各企业、机关和事业单位中，双反的步骤和方法尽管有所不同，但基础都是放在大字报上；在高等学校里，自然也不应例外。大字报愈多，事情也就愈好办。一方面，大字报充分表达了运动中的群众情绪；而没有群众运动，往往是难以打动某些知识分子的。另一方面，大字报尖锐地提出了是非问题，有了是非，就可争辩，就能促进问题的解决。因此，我们必须充分重视在高等学校中一天就出现了成千成万张大字报的新的局面。
    高等学校的大字报，从学校生活、学习到教育方针和领导作风，无一不涉及，很多学校还提出了一个最基本的问题：培养出来学生，如果不是又红又专，就是最大的浪费。这个问题提得非常好。培养又红又专的人才，这是高等学校双反的基本任务。希望高等学校在双反运动中，能彻底解决这个问题。
    目前，高等学校双反运动的发展，还不平衡，许多学校的运动已向纵深发展，落后的需要迅速急起直追。学校的领导者应该继续放手发动群众，大鸣大放。但是，同时也要善于在群众大鸣大放之时，头脑清醒地认真研究和分析群众提出来的各种意见，首先要抓住群众迫切要求解决的重大问题，对一些需要开展讨论的问题，引导群众积极进行争辩，弄清是非，并提出改进的意见；对那些意见一致，可以马上改的，应立即就改。这样就能更有力地鼓舞群众，使运动步步深入。希望通过这次双反运动，彻底地展开高等学校在办学的两条道路和办学的两种方法上的斗争，打破各种落后保守现象，使高等教育来一个大跃进。
