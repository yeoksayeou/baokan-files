Experimental Plots Cannot Be "Farmed by Proxy"

Two bureau chiefs of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau selected Tongren Hospital as their experimental plot. Their method of cultivating the experimental plot was quite unique. When they went to the experimental plot, they brought along three section chiefs and three comrades who did "specific" work, truly a grand entourage. A comrade from the Public Health Bureau wrote a big-character poster saying that this was not farming themselves, but letting others "farm by proxy," criticizing them for only circling the edge of the field. This is well said. "Planting" like this will, as the peasants of Hong'an County say, cause the ridges of the experimental plots to collapse. I wonder if the responsible comrades of the Public Health Bureau have read the Party Central Committee's instructions on promoting "experimental plots"? If you have read it, then please tell me, if planting experimental plots like this also requires others to "farm by proxy," is this, as the Central Committee said, eliminating bureaucracy, or is it developing bureaucracy? The Party Central Committee said that planting experimental plots can enable cadres to embark on the road of being both red and expert, and realize the unity of technology and politics. Please tell me, does planting like this help to be red or help to be expert?

### 试验田不能“代耕”

    试验田不能“代耕”
    北京市公共卫生局的两位局长选定了同仁医院做他们的试验田。他们种试验田的办法很特别，到试验田去的时候还带上三位科长和三位做“具体”工作的同志，真是前呼后拥。公共卫生局的一位同志写大字报说这不是自己种田，而是让别人“代耕”，批评他们不该只在田埂上转圈儿。这话说得很好。像这样的“种”法，真要像红安县的农民所说的，要把试验田的田埂子都踩坍了。不知道公共卫生局的负责同志读过党中央关于推行“试验田”的指示没有？如果读过，那么请问，像这样种试验田也要由别人“代耕”，究竟是如中央所说的在扫除官风呢，还是在发展官风；党中央说，种试验田可以使干部走上又红又专的道路，实现技术与政治的统一，请问像这样的种法，是有助于红呢还是有助于专？
