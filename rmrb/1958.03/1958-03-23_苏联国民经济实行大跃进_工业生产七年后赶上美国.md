Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 22nd. Petrov, acting director of the Comprehensive Department of Long-Range Planning of the Soviet State Planning Committee, recently told our reporter that during the upcoming seven-year (1959-1965) long-range plan, the development speed of the Soviet national economy will be a "Great Leap Forward" speed. By the end of the plan, Soviet industrial production will be very close to the level of the United States.

Petrov pointed out that the work of formulating the Soviet seven-year long-range plan for developing the national economy is currently being carried out in various enterprises, departments, economic regions, republics, and the State Planning Committee. The State Planning Committee has organized thirty specialized committees to carefully study the long-range plans of various departments. Preliminary plans for various departments have now been formulated. The entire plan will be completed before July 1st and submitted by the State Planning Committee to the Soviet Council of Ministers for review.

Petrov pointed out that the starting point for formulating the seven-year long-range plan was the report made by Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, at the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution held in Moscow last year. In his report, he put forward the task of the Soviet Union catching up with and surpassing the United States in the output of important industrial products within the next fifteen years. Petrov said that the seven-year plan will be a component of the Soviet communist construction's fifteen-year general plan.

Petrov mentioned that there are many characteristics of this seven-year long-range plan formulation. First, it widely absorbs the participation of workers and masses from various regions and enterprises in the discussion. Second, the long-range plan pays special attention to making production more rational and economically sound. Third, the issue of adopting new scientific and technological achievements will be fully reflected in the long-range plan. He also pointed out that the long-range plan takes into account the comprehensive development of many economic regions. The task in this regard is to enable various regions to utilize local natural resources more effectively and to the greatest extent.

When talking about the content of the long-range plan, Petrov said that in the next seven years, the steel, chemical, petroleum, gas, electric power industries, and railway transportation will develop rapidly. The development of the steel industry will mainly be concentrated in the eastern region, and electricity production will double. The production of artificial fibers, artificial leather, and plastics will be greatly developed, and plastics will be widely used to replace steel in construction and machine manufacturing.

In agriculture, the seven-year plan will stipulate increasing the yield per unit area of ​​crops, continuing to reclaim wasteland, increasing the cotton planting area, improving the crop rotation system, and increasing the number of livestock and the output of livestock products. The plan also prepares to supply agriculture with the latest machinery, and some of the older machines will no longer be used.
