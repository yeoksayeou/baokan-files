    Repairing Water Conservancy Without Wasting an Acre of Farmland
    Yangzhong County Comes Up With Six Methods for Extracting Soil
    (Our Report) The Yangzhong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province, during the large-scale winter and spring water conservancy construction movement, mobilized the masses to create six good methods for undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects without wasting an acre of farmland.
    Yangzhong County has little land and a large population, with an average of less than nine fen of land per person. This year, Yangzhong County is undertaking large-scale water conservancy projects. The County Committee relied on the broad masses to actively research and create six methods for extracting soil, ensuring that not a single acre of farmland is wasted. These six methods are: 1. Converting high fields into low fields. Some of the original high dryland fields are dug to the same level as the low fields. The dug-up soil can be used to reinforce the dikes, and the leveled fields can be converted to growing rice; 2. For fields with the same surface level, the ridges in the middle are removed, turning small fields into large fields, and the soil from the ridges is used to reinforce the banks; 3. Dredging soil from harbor channels. The river water is drained, and the river mud is taken up for use as fertilizer. The hard soil underneath is dug up for use in repairing dikes; 4. In the past, repairing river embankments wasted a lot of fields. Now, all the mud for repairing the embankments is taken from the outer beach six zhang away from the embankment; 5. Deepening the drainage ditches in the wheat fields not only avoids wasting a single acre of land but also speeds up the drainage of the ditches; 6. Fields that were wasted in the past are now continued to be dug deeper, creating ponds for planting aquatic plants.

    修水利不废一分粮田
    扬中县想出六种取土法
    本报讯　中共江苏扬中县委在冬春大规模兴修水利运动中，发动群众创造出六种大兴水利不废一分粮田的好方法。
    扬中县地少人多，平均每人不到九分田。今年扬中县大兴水利，县委依靠广大群众积极研究创造了六种取土办法，保证了不挖废一分粮田。这六种办法是：一、高田改低田。把原来一部分高的旱作田，挖得与低田一样平，挖掉的土可以用于加修圩堤，挖平了的田又可改种水稻；二、田面相平的田，挖掉中间的田埂，使小田变成大田，田埂的土用于加修圩岸；三、车港取泥，将河水车干，河泥取上来做肥料，下面硬的泥土，挖上来用于修圩堤；四、修江堤过去挖废很多田，现在全部修堤的泥都到离堤六丈远的外滩去取。五、挖深麦田里的排水沟，既可以不浪费一分田，又使水沟排水快；六、过去挖废的田，现在继续挖深，可挖成水塘，种植水生植物。
