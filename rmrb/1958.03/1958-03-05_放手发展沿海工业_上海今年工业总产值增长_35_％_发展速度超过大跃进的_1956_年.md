Shanghai is known as the "thermometer" of China's economic life. This year, Shanghai's industrial production and construction are facing an unprecedented new situation of great development and great prosperity. After six leaps forward, the industrial production plan has been initially determined: the total output value this year will be 15.39 billion yuan, an increase of 35% over the total industrial output value in 1957, and local industry will increase by 40%. This development speed exceeds the fastest industrial growth rate in history in 1956.

The great prosperity of Shanghai's industrial production this year is a concentrated reflection of the overall Great Leap Forward of the national economy, with industrial and agricultural production as the center. The local industries that support agricultural and water conservancy and other rural construction have the largest increase this year, especially the electromechanical industry, whose output value will increase by 100% compared with last year; the diesel engines, electric motors, and water pumps supplied to rural areas will increase by two, three, and five times, respectively, compared with last year. Shanghai's local electromechanical industry products that support industrial construction in various places, such as metal cutting machine tools, steam boilers, transformers, and DC motors, will all increase by two to three times this year compared with last year. Among them, the cutting machine tools alone can meet the needs of more than one hundred small machinery factories with around one hundred people. Various people's daily necessities and light industrial products produced in Shanghai, which enjoy a reputation in domestic and foreign markets, will also have a large increase this year. The largest increase is in sewing machines and bicycles. This year, 600,000 bicycles will be produced, an increase of 330,000 over last year; this year, 420,000 sewing machines will be produced, an increase of 250,000 over last year. In terms of trial-producing new products, the original plan of the four industrial departments was to trial-produce 1,609 kinds, but now the new product manufacturing plans of each department have been repeatedly broken through by the masses. The Light Industry Bureau originally planned to trial-produce 88 new products this year, but it has now increased to 892, an increase of nine times. The content of Shanghai's new products this year is exceptionally rich, including important ones such as large, medium, and small complete sets of chemical fertilizer manufacturing equipment, universal tractors, internal combustion turbine, silicon steel sheets, photographic paper, universal sewing machines, calendar electric clocks, and time-telling electric clocks.

Shanghai's raw material industry will also usher in a Great Leap Forward this year. The newly built seamless steel tube factory, silicon steel sheet factory, and black iron sheet workshop will all start production ahead of schedule. The city's production of seamless steel tubes will increase by 5.6 times compared with last year. Many chemical raw materials have increased by more than double compared with last year.

Now, an unprecedented production upsurge has been set off in more than 10,000 factories in Shanghai. The cooperative relationship between factories, between local factories and central factories, and between industry and commerce has been greatly improved. Many factories have had their tasks increased several times, but people are full of confidence and in good order. This production upsurge has converged with the struggle against waste and conservatism, and they promote and facilitate each other.

    放手发展沿海工业
    上海今年工业总产值增长35％
    发展速度超过大跃进的1956年
    本报上海4日电　记者习平报道：一向被称为我国经济生活的
  “寒暑表”的上海市，今年工业生产和工业建设面临着一个空前大发展、大繁荣的新形势。工业生产计划经过六次跃进，现在已经初步确定：今年生产总值为一百五十三亿九千万元，比1957年工业生产总值增长35％，地方工业则增长40％。这个发展速度超过了历史上工业增长最快的1956年。
    今年上海工业生产的大繁荣，是国内以工农业生产为中心的国民经济全面大跃进的集中反映。上海工业今年增长最多的是支援农业和水利等农村建设的地方工业，其中特别是机电工业，产值将比去年增加100％；供应农村的柴油机、电动机、水泵比去年分别增长到二倍、三倍和五倍。上海地方机电工业为支援各地工业建设的产品，如金属切削机床、蒸气锅炉、变压器、直流电机，今年的生产都比去年增长二倍到三倍。其中切削机床一项就可以满足一百多个一百人上下的小型机械工厂的需要。载誉国内外市场的上海生产的各种人民生活用品和轻工业品，今年也将有很大增长。增长比例最大的是缝纫机和自行车。自行车今年将生产六十万辆，比去年增产三十三万辆；缝纫机今年将生产四十二万架，比去年增产二十五万架。在试制新产品方面，四个工业部门原定计划是试制一千六百零九种，现在各部门新产品制造计划已被群众一再突破。轻工业局今年原计划试制新产品八十八种，目前已经增加到八百九十二种，增加了九倍。今年上海新产品的内容异常丰富，其中重要的有大型、中型、小型三种全套制造化学肥料的设备，万能拖拉机，内燃汽轮机，矽钢片，照相感光纸，万能缝纫机，日历电钟，报时电钟等。
    上海的原料工业今年也将来一个大跃进。新建的无缝钢管厂、矽钢片厂、黑铁皮车间，都将提前开始生产。全市无缝钢管的生产将比去年增长五点六倍。许多化工原料都比去年增长一倍以上。
    现在，一个规模空前的生产高潮已经在上海一万多工厂里掀起来。工厂与工厂之间，地方厂与中央厂之间，工业与商业之间的协作关系都大有改进。许多工厂任务增加了几倍，但是人们信心百倍，秩序井然。这个生产高潮已经和反浪费、反保守的斗争汇合起来，并且互相推动，互相促进。
