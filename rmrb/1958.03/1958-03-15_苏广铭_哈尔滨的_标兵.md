Su Guangming, an old milling machine operator at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and a National Advanced Producer, has become an advanced "pacesetter" for the workers of Harbin to emulate, learn from, and catch up with.

Communist Party member Su Guangming has always been ahead of schedule. He is already working on the tasks for November 1962, and aims to complete the Second Five-Year Plan by March of this year. He has also decided to strive to complete the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan by 1962.

For eight years, Su Guangming has not produced a single defective product, has not had a single mechanical or personal injury accident, and has not been absent from work for a single day.

Su Guangming is a technical innovator of the working class. He has gradually transformed an old machine tool that had been in use for thirty years into a universal machine tool that is highly efficient and capable of producing precision products. Over the past few years, he has created and improved forty-four types of advanced tools. He frequently pays attention to saving raw materials and collecting old tools for renovation and reuse. The calculable savings over the past few years amount to approximately 24,000 yuan. (Attached photo)

    苏广铭——哈尔滨的“标兵”
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的老铣工、全国先进生产者苏广铭，已经成了哈尔滨市职工比先进、学先进、赶先进的先进“标兵”。
    共产党员苏广铭一向走在时间的最前面。他现在已经在做1 962年11月份的活，今年3月就要争取完成第二个五年计划。他还决定要争取在1962年完成第三个五年计划的任务。
    苏广铭八年来没有出一件废品，没有出过一次机械和人身事故，没有缺一天勤。
    苏广铭是一个工人阶级的技术革新家。他把使用了三十年的旧机床，逐步改造成为效率高能做出精密产品的万能机床。他几年来创造和改进了四十四种先进工具。他经常注意节约原材料和收集旧工具翻新使用，几年来可以计算出来的节约价值，就约有二万四千多元。（附图片）
