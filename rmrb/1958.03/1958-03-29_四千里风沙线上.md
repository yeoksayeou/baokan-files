Along the Four Thousand Li Wind and Sand Line

Starting from Yanchi County in the Ningxia Plain, passing through 25 counties and cities including Helan, Zhongwei, Minqin, and Jiuquan, and ending at Hala Lake in Dunhuang County at the western end of the Hexi Corridor, the four thousand four hundred li long wind and sand line is where tens of thousands of farmers are building a green Great Wall. On the towering sand dunes, in the vast Gobi Desert, and on the saline-alkali lands, the vast numbers of farmers are engaged in a heroic struggle. They want to conquer the wind and sand that has plagued the people for centuries, turning the Gobi into an oasis and the desert into fertile farmland.

The Fierce "Yellow Dragon"

For thousands of years, the Inner Mongolia Desert north of this line has continuously attacked the people, extending southward at a rate of four to forty meters each year, eroding the land. When the wind rises, the rolling yellow sand blots out the sky and the sun, truly making it so that "one can hear the voice but not see the person face to face, and lights must be lit indoors during the day." The fierce wind and sand have taken away fertile land, buried canals, and crushed estates. "Sand dunes压庄园, 流沙埋农田; 西风打禾苗, 东风吹干田" [Sand dunes crush estates, shifting sands bury farmland; the west wind beats down the seedlings, the east wind dries up the fields]—these four lines widely circulated among the masses tell of the suffering of millions of farm families. No wonder people call the sand dunes "sand tigers" and "yellow dragons!" Along this wind and sand line, 100,000 hectares of farmland are damaged by wind and sand every year. In Minqin County alone, 10,000 hectares of fertile land were buried in 1950. In Jingbianyi District of Wuwei County, wind and sand devoured 47,000 hectares of farmland and silted up the canals of more than 2,700 hectares of irrigated land over a period of forty years. Now, in the desert, one can still see the ruins of walls, the remnants of many castles and residences. Under the threat of this disaster, many people were ruined, and they had to leave their homes with tears in their eyes, taking their children and daughters to flee to unfamiliar places.

In the years since liberation, the Party has brought confidence and assurance to the people along the line to change this natural landscape. The people along the line, holding high the banner of advancing towards the Gobi Desert, have launched a series of activities such as planting windbreaks, burying sand dunes, and planting trees and grass to conquer the wind and sand.

However, freeing people's minds from their original fear of natural disasters and passive avoidance, and actively fighting against wind and sand, has been an exceptionally tortuous process. When the Party initially proposed the call to fix sand and plant forests, many farmers doubted and hesitated, saying: "That is divine sand, can people really fix it?!" They said: "The yellow dragon, the more you suppress it, the poorer you become; suppressing it will bring even greater misfortune." Faced with these difficulties, many Communist Party members demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness, using their own exemplary behavior to motivate the masses and boldly begin experiments.

Only Go Forward, Never Retreat

In 1952, a canal in Xiangjiachao Lake Sand Nest in Jinta County was blocked by a sand dune. According to past practices, the county water conservancy department decided to bypass the sand dune and open a new canal. Cadre Ma Nengyuan studied this issue and asked the cadres of the water conservancy department: "The original canal is buried in sand, we rebuild one, and if the wind and sand come again next year, we have to rebuild it again. It chases us every year, and we run away every year, how can this work? Why can't we go forward and fight it head-on to see if we can fix it!" From passive avoidance to active combat is a 180-degree turn! When this unprecedented initiative was submitted for discussion at a meeting of district and township cadres, it caused fierce debate, but the meeting finally made the decision to suppress the sand and plant trees. At this time, the masses' thinking was not yet clear. Many of the laborers mobilized from various villages to suppress sand and plant trees were old men and children, and some did not even bring tools. After three days of work, a sand dune with an area of 60 mu was half-buried with loess. The masses saw the results of their work and strength from collective labor, and their morale rose. Their courage and confidence in overcoming nature became even stronger. Many young and middle-aged people joined this ranks, and many people changed their original passive thinking and brought iron hoes and dirt baskets from their homes. People finally buried the entire sand dune in seven days and planted trees around the sand dune. The canal that was originally planned to be rerouted would no longer need to be rerouted. Building a protective forest belt along the four thousand four hundred li long wind and sand line began in such a tortuous struggle. Since then, various places have promoted and encouraged each other, gradually forming a line-wide offensive.

Creations for Controlling Wind and Sand

Starting in 1953, the number of people participating in fixing sand and planting forests increased year by year, the scale became larger and larger year by year, and the experience of the masses in fighting nature became richer and richer. Farmers in Minqin, Jinta, Anxi and other counties created methods for fixing sand with wet soil, fixing sand with mud, fixing sand with clay blocks, and fixing sand with straw mats, and created methods for preventing the advance of shifting sand such as closing beaches to cultivate grass, closing sand to cultivate grass, flooding red willows, and planting windbreaks. Farmers in Zhongwei, Zhongning and other counties have explored a set of afforestation methods from practice: "防沿沙布防, 沙内设点, 连点成网, 以网固沙" [deploy defenses along the sand, set up points within the sand, connect the points into a network, and fix the sand with the network]. Farmers in the Hexi area summarized the method of using physical facilities to transform nature and protect seedlings with front and rear barriers. The Sanpingkou Nursery in Minqin County has gained experience in improving the survival rate of dryland seedling cultivation based on the principle of using sand to eliminate alkali and fertilize the land. The Jiayuguan Agricultural Cooperative in Jiuquan County has experimented with preliminary methods for greening the Gobi Desert. All these creations have greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the masses for fixing sand and planting forests. As of last year, a total of more than 80,000 hectares of forests have been planted along the entire line, more than 300,000 hectares of sand and beach have been closed for grass and forest cultivation, the total length of windbreaks planted is more than 1,400 kilometers, and more than 14,800 mu of sand dunes have been buried. In this huge struggle, some villages and communities that basically control wind and sand have emerged. For example, in Sushan Township in Minqin County, before liberation, fourteen villages were crushed, 800 mu of farmland was swallowed, 1,000 mu of land was severely damaged, 70% of farmers lacked half a year's worth of food, and sixty-two households fled the famine. Now all 1,800 mu of land has been restored to cultivation, and 300 mu of land has been newly reclaimed, increasing production by 36,000 jin of grain each year. Due to the elimination of disasters, the yield per mu of other land has also increased by 115 jin. In Beichi Village, Yongchang County, nearly half of the 2,800 mu of farmland before liberation was often hit by wind and sand, and now the average yield per mu of these lands has increased from 100 jin in 1952 to 342 jin. This village has also expanded its cultivated land by more than 1,300 mu.

Build a Green Great Wall in Three Years

According to the planning of the forestry department, by 1962, a large forest belt with a length of 2,200 kilometers, a width of 1.5 kilometers, and an area of 330,000 hectares, 94 branch forest belts with a total length of 3,400 kilometers and an area of 340,000 hectares, and 10,000 hectares of field protection forest networks will be built on the entire wind and sand line. After this plan is realized, 10 million mu of suitable arable land can be added along the line, and 3 billion jin of grain can be produced annually after reclamation. The 100,000 hectares of farmland that suffered from disasters in the past will also be permanently liberated from the clutches of wind and sand, increasing grain production by 30% each year. At the same time, the trees planted and the grasslands closed for cultivation will, by 1967, in addition to supplying people with a large amount of construction timber, also produce 1.5 million tons of firewood, 5 million jin of fruit, and 8 million tons of green manure. Now, the work of fixing sand and planting forests on the wind and sand line is progressing at an unprecedented speed. Most areas have stated that they will strive to complete the green Great Wall within three years. This year's afforestation area may reach more than one million mu, equivalent to 80% of the total afforestation area in the eight years after liberation. The tractors of the two state-owned mechanical afforestation farms will carry out land preparation and afforestation in sparsely populated areas for the first time. In the near future, this great plan will become a reality, and on the sandy beaches where "the floating sand covers the ankles and people and animals are afraid to walk," lush grape trellises and fruit-laden orchards will appear.

    四千里风沙线上
    东起宁夏平原的盐池县，经过贺兰、中卫、民勤、酒泉等二十五个县、市，直到河西走廊西端敦煌县的哈拉湖，长达四千四百华里的风沙线上，成千上万的农民正在营造一座绿色长城。在群立的沙丘上，在大戈壁上，在盐碱滩上，广大农民展开了英勇的斗争。他们要征服从多少世纪以来一直为害人民的风沙，使戈壁化成绿洲，沙漠变成良田。
    凶恶的“黄龙”
    千百年来，沿着这条线以北的内蒙古沙漠，不断地袭击着人们，每年以四公尺到四十公尺的速度向南伸展着，侵蚀着。大风一起，滚滚黄沙，遮天蔽日，真是“对面闻声不见人，屋内白天点油灯”。凶恶的风沙，夺去了良田，掩没了渠道，压毁了庄园。“沙丘压庄园，流沙埋农田；西风打禾苗，东风吹干田”——普遍流行在群众中的四句话，道出了千千万万农家的苦难。难怪人们把沙丘叫作“沙老虎”、“黄龙”！沿着这条风沙线，每年有十万公顷耕地受到风沙的灾害。仅仅民勤县在1950年就有一万公顷良田被掩没掉。武威县靖边驿一个区，四十年当中，风沙吞噬掉耕地四万七千公顷，淤塞了二千七百多公顷水地的渠道。现在在沙漠里，还可以看到残垣断壁，这是许多城堡、住宅的遗迹。在这种灾害的威胁下，许多人倾家荡产，他们不得不噙着眼泪，携儿带女，逃奔到陌生的地方。
    解放后几年来，党为沿线人民改变这一自然面貌带来了信心和保证。沿线人民高举着向戈壁沙荒进军的旗帜，展开了插植风墙埋压沙丘、植树种草等一系列的活动，要把风沙征服。
    但是，把人们的思想从原来的对自然灾害的恐惧、消极回避中解脱出来，积极跟风沙作斗争，却也经过了一个异常曲折的过程。当党初步提出固沙造林的号召时，许多农民怀疑着，犹豫着，他们说：“那是神沙，人还能把它固定下来？！”他们说：“黄龙黄龙，愈压愈穷，压了之后会带来更大的不幸”。面对着这些困难，许多共产党员表现了大无畏的精神，以自己的模范行为带动着群众，着手大胆的尝试。
    只能迎上去不能退下来
    1952年，金塔县向家潮湖沙窝有一个渠道被沙丘压住，县水利科根据过去的做法，决定绕过沙丘另开一条新的渠道。干部马能元研究了这个问题，他问水利科的干部：“原有的渠道被沙埋住了，我们重修一条，明年风沙再来，又得再修，它年年赶，我们年年跑，这怎么行呢？为什么我们不能迎上去，和它打打交手仗，看能不能把它固定下来！”从消极回避到主动战斗，是个一百八十度的大转折！这个空前的倡议在区乡干部座谈会上提交讨论时，曾经引起了激烈的争论，但是，这次座谈会终于做出了压沙植树的决定。这时群众思想还没有通，各村动员来压沙植树的民工，很多是老头和小孩，有的人连工具也没带。经过三天的工作，一个面积六十亩大的沙丘用黄土埋住了一半。群众从集体劳动中，看到自己的工作成果和力量，情绪高涨起来了，战胜自然的勇气和信心更加坚定了。许多青壮年参加到这一行列，许多人改变了原来消极的思想，从家里拿来了铁铣和土筐。人们终于在七天当中把整个沙丘埋住，在沙丘周围栽种了树木。原来计划要改修的渠道，从此不要再改道了。营造四千四百华里长的风沙线上的防护林带，就是在这样曲折的斗争中开了头。从此，各地互相推动，互相鼓舞，逐渐形成了全线性的进攻。
    控制风沙的创造
    从1953年开始，参加固沙造林的人数一年比一年增多，规模一年比一年壮大，群众和自然斗争的经验也愈来愈丰富。民勤、金塔、安西等县农民，创造了湿土压沙法、抹泥固沙法、胶泥块压沙法、草席压沙法，创造了封滩育草、封沙育草、漫灌红柳、插植风墙等阻止流沙前进的方法。中卫、中宁等县农民，从实践中摸索出“沿沙布防、沙内设点、连点成网、以网固沙”的一套造林方法，河西一带农民总结出利用物理设施改造自然保护树苗的前拦后挡造林方法。民勤县三坪口苗圃根据以沙灭碱肥地的原理，取得了提高旱地育苗成活率的经验。酒泉县嘉峪关农业合作社试验出绿化戈壁的初步办法。所有这些创造，大大促进了群众固沙造林的积极性。截至去年，全线共造林八万多公顷，封沙封滩育草育林三十多万公顷，插风墙总长一千四百多公里，埋压沙丘一万四千八百多亩。在这一巨大的斗争中，已出现了一些基本控制风沙的乡、社。比如民勤县苏山乡，解放以前，有十四个村庄被压掉，八百亩耕地被吞没，一千亩土地受到严重的灾害，70％的农户缺半年口粮，六十二户人家逃荒。现在那一千八百亩土地全部恢复耕种，还新垦了三百亩地，每年增产三万六千斤粮食。别的土地，也由于灾害的消除，亩产提高了一百一十五斤。永昌县北池村，解放前二千八百亩耕地中就有将近一半庄稼经常被风沙打掉，现在这些地平均亩产量从1952年的一百斤，上升到三百四十二斤。这个村另外还扩大耕地一千三百多亩。
    三年建成绿色长城
    按照林业部门规划，到1962年，在整个风沙线上将营造一条长二千二百公里、宽一公里半、面积三十三万公顷的大林带，九十四条全长三千四百公里，面积三十四万公顷的支干林带，和一万公顷的护田林网。这个计划实现之后，沿线可增加一千万亩的宜垦耕地，垦耕后每年可产三十亿斤粮食。过去受灾的十万公顷耕地，也将永远从风沙的魔掌中解放出来，每年增产30％的粮食。同时，栽种的林木和封育的草滩，到1967年，除了供应人们大量的建筑用材外，还将生产一百五十万吨薪材、五百万斤水果、八百万吨绿肥。现在，风沙线上的固沙造林工作正以空前的速度向前进展。大部分地区都表示要三年内力争完成绿长城。今年造林面积可能达到一百多万亩，相当于解放后八年来造林总面积的80％。两个国营机械造林场的拖拉机，即将首次在人烟稀少的地方进行整地造林。不久的将来，这个伟大的计划就要变成现实，在“浮沙没胫、人畜惮行”的沙滩上，将会出现翠绿欲滴的葡萄架，出现果实累累的果园。
