Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The Third New Film Exhibition Week, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, will be held in two batches in twenty-seven cities across the country starting on the 22nd. Tonight, the opening ceremony of the Exhibition Week was held in Beijing. Wang Lanxi, Assistant Minister of Culture and Director of the Film Bureau, said at the opening ceremony that in 1957, China produced forty feature films and more than two hundred other films of various lengths. The twenty-two films to be screened in this Exhibition Week are only a representative part of them. Even from this part of the films, it reflects the achievements made by China's film industry in the past year. The themes and styles of these films are broader than in previous years. From these films, we can see that China's film production and creation have made progress. Wang Lanxi also said that the reason why China's film industry has achieved such results should be attributed to the strong and correct leadership of the Party; to the implementation of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy and the adherence to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as their own hard work; it should also be attributed to the constant support, supervision, and criticism of film work by the literary and art circles and the broad masses of the audience; at the same time, it is also due to the anti-Rightist struggle carried out by the film industry under the leadership of the Party, which purified its ranks and greatly enhanced the enthusiasm of film workers. The Rightists slander that China's film industry is worthless. The films exhibited now and the films to be released successively later are iron facts, enough to shatter their ulterior motives. Wang Lanxi then said that some of our films also have ideologically unhealthy elements, especially the production of the bad film "Unfinished Comedy," which should be a warning to all our film workers. He hoped that the national literary and art circles and the audience will continue to criticize and guide film work.
    Cai Chusheng, Chairman of the China Film Workers Association, said that the films exhibited this time were produced under the guidance of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, and therefore, have the spirit and characteristics of this era. He hoped that film workers would go all out and make a great leap forward in the film industry and artistic creation, and achieve even better results next year.
    Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, and famous film actors, as well as the screenwriters and directors of the films exhibited this time, attended the opening ceremony.

    去年影片生产成就大检阅
    第三次新片展览周今日开始
    据新华社21日讯　文化部主办的第三次新片展览周22日起分两批在全国二十七个城市举行。今天晚上，在北京举行了展览周的开幕式。文化部部长助理、电影事业管理局局长王阑西在开幕式上说，1957年一年中我国生产了四十部故事片和其他各种长短片二百多部，这次在展览周中将放映的二十二部影片只是其中有代表性的一部分，即使从这一部分影片里，也反映出我国电影事业在过去一年间获得的收获；这些影片的题材和样式都较往年广泛；从这些影片里可以看到我国电影制作和创作上已经有了进步。王阑西又说，我国电影事业所以获得如此成绩，应该归功于党的坚强的正确的领导；归功于全体电影工作者贯彻执行党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策和坚持了为工农兵服务的方向以及他们自己的辛勤劳动；也要归功于文艺界和广大观众对电影工作的经常支持、督促和批评；同时也由于电影界在党的领导下所进行的反右派斗争纯洁了自己的队伍，大大提高了电影工作者的积极性。右派分子污蔑我国电影事业一无是处，现在展出的影片以及以后要陆续放映的影片，就是铁的事实，足以粉碎他们别有用心的论调。王阑西接着说，我们的影片中也有一些在思想上是不够健康的片子，特别是制作了坏片“未完成的喜剧”，这是我们全体电影工作者应该引以为戒的，希望全国文艺界和观众继续对电影工作进行批评和指导。
    中国电影工作者联谊会主席蔡楚生说，这次展览的影片，是在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针照耀下产生的，因此，具有这个时代的精神和特征。他希望电影工作者鼓足干劲，在电影事业上和艺术创作上来个大跃进，明年做出更好的成就。
    文化部部长沈雁冰和著名电影演员，和这次展出的影片的编剧和导演等出席了开幕式。
