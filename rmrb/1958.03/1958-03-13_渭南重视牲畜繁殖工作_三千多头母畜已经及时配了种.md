Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 11th: Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has already bred over 3,000 head of female livestock in its 855 agricultural cooperatives.

This year, the weather warmed up early, and the estrus period of female livestock also came early. The breeding personnel in various townships of Weinan County are adopting methods such as catching up with market days and going from village to village to promote livestock breeding work early. This year, the agricultural cooperatives have a great enthusiasm for breeding livestock, and they have all held breeding meetings, proposing to breed as soon as estrus occurs, and assigning special personnel to monitor the estrus of female livestock to strive for timely breeding.

Weinan County is a plain agricultural area. Since resolutely implementing the policy of "self-breeding, self-raising, and self-sufficiency," the county's draft animals have greatly developed. The county plans to develop the number of draft animals to over 71,000 by 1962, and is preparing to work hard for three years to strive for early completion.

    渭南重视牲畜繁殖工作
    三千多头母畜已经及时配了种
    新华社西安11日电　陕西省渭南县的八百五十五个农业社，已经给三千多头母畜配了种。
    今年天气暖和得早，母畜发情期也来得早，渭南县各乡的配种员，正在用赶集上会，走乡串社的办法，提早展开母畜配种工作。各农业社今年繁殖牲畜的劲头很大，都召开了配种会议，提出随发情随配，指定专人掌握母畜发情的情况，争取及时配种。
    渭南县是一个平原农业区，自从坚决执行“自繁、自养、自给”的方针后，全县的耕畜得到了很大的发展。全县计划到1962年使耕畜发展到七万一千多头，准备苦战三年争取提前完成。
