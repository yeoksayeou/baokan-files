Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 22nd: (By our correspondent) The political situation here has been very tense for nearly half a month. In the parliament's lounge, political figures are discussing the lifespan of the Gaillard cabinet; on the streets, ordinary Parisians are also anxiously talking about the new plots of fascists to seize power.

Although the government won its seventh vote of confidence in the National Assembly on the 18th, four months after taking office, people believe that the Gaillard government is merely prolonging its existence.

An article in the British "Foreign Report" on the 13th pointed out the reasons for such political turmoil in France, saying: "As long as the Algerian war continues, France will continue to teeter on the brink of a deeper crisis." This war not only brought France's finances and economy to the brink of bankruptcy, deepened France's dependence on American creditors, but also forced France to tolerate the United States taking the opportunity to further invade North Africa under the pretext of "mediating" the disputes between France and Tunisia, in order to replace France's position.

At the same time, the future of the Algerian colonial war is becoming increasingly dim. Even the French right-wing newspapers are worried about repeating the mistakes of the Indochina colonial war.

In this situation, the Socialist Party, which won 100 seats by advocating a peaceful solution to the Algerian problem, has been under increasing pressure from voters and ordinary party members. At the party's National Committee meeting last week, some people proposed that the Socialist Party withdraw from the government and demanded that a special party meeting be convened to discuss the Algerian issue. Although the proposal was later rejected, even Mollet himself had to admit that it was becoming increasingly difficult to participate in and support the Gaillard government.

The Independent Party, which Gaillard believed would cause the government to collapse if it did not receive its support, criticized Gaillard's Algerian policy and the entire North African policy as not "tough" enough at its national congress last week. It threatened to withdraw from the government and demanded that Gaillard not make concessions under the "mediation" of the United States and Britain. It also wanted the government to invest more forces in the Algerian war. In this regard, it received strong support from the Social Republican Party. Now, this party has decided to make a decision on the 25th on whether to withdraw from the government alliance.

In addition to the Algerian issue, the irreconcilable conflicts of interest among the parties in the Gaillard government alliance on the revision of the constitution and the election law have also exacerbated the current tense political atmosphere in France. These parties all hope to revise the relatively democratic constitution and election law so that a government that deviates from the will of the people and only obtains minority support in the parliament can still govern for a long time and can deprive the Communist Party of its representation in the parliament. On the other hand, especially in terms of the election law, the parties have very different considerations on how to revise it to be most beneficial to their own party. The Gaillard government used the vote of confidence as a weapon on the issue of constitutional amendment, and forced the National Assembly to pass its constitutional amendment draft on the morning of the 23rd in the second reading. However, the government obtained less than a two-thirds majority; therefore, according to regulations, this bill must be submitted to a referendum after being passed by the Senate of the Republic. Moreover, it is also difficult to be optimistic about whether the election law can be revised to the satisfaction of all parties participating in the government. Observers pointed out that the road to revising the election law, which has caused the French government to fall more than once, will still be a bumpy and difficult road for the Gaillard government.

While the Gaillard government is stepping up the Algerian colonial war and stepping up the conspiracy to amend the constitution, the arrogance of all kinds of fascist elements in France is also getting higher and higher. It is pointed out that the activities of the fascist elements are directly and indirectly encouraged by the above-mentioned reactionary acts of the authorities. Now, the activities of fascist thugs have developed from attacking the offices of the French Communist Party and other democratic organizations and intimidating voters who support the Communist Party to holding open rallies and demonstrations. The fact that the Paris police surrounded the parliament on the afternoon of the 13th, demanding that the fascist leaders be in power and arbitrarily insulting the deputies, is a typical example. And Gaillard's sheltering of Interior Minister Boucher-Manoury, who is responsible for this fascist action, indirectly fueled the arrogance of the fascist elements. There are reports that de Gaulle, who announced his withdrawal from the political stage in 1953 because he was spurned by the French people, is now eager to try again. It is said that he intends to come out and lead a "strong government."

In response to the current situation, the French Communist Party called on the French left-wing forces to unite and smash the fascist conspiracy, establish a left-wing government, and save France. At present, people who support democratic republic are uniting more and more widely to give the fascist elements a strong counterattack. The anti-fascist rally and parade of tens of thousands of working people in Paris on the evening of the 18th was an action in this regard. Observers here emphasized that if the French working people and all democratic republican elements can unite around the Communist Party and form a strong united front, then they will certainly be able to crush the new conspiracy of the fascist elements today, just like they defeated the fascist coup conspiracy in February 1934.

### 法国摇摆在危机的边缘  盖伊阿政府继续倒行逆施　法西斯分子正跃跃欲试  法国左翼力量加强团结准备坚决回击

    法国摇摆在危机的边缘
    盖伊阿政府继续倒行逆施　法西斯分子正跃跃欲试
    法国左翼力量加强团结准备坚决回击
    新华社巴黎22日电　本社记者报道：近半个月以来，这里的政治局势显得非常紧张。在议会休息室里，政界人士纷纷议论盖伊阿内阁的寿命问题；在街头巷尾，巴黎普通人也在不安地谈论法西斯分子夺取政权的新阴谋。
    尽管政府18日在国民议会赢得了它上台四个月以来的第七次信任票，然而人们认为盖伊阿政府不过是在苟延残喘罢了。
    英国“外事报道”13日的一篇文章指出法国政局如此动荡原因，它说：“只要阿尔及利亚战争继续下去，法国将继续摇摆在更深的危机的边缘上。”这个战争不但使法国的财政经济频于破产，使法国对美国债主的依赖加深，而且使法国不得不容忍美国借口“斡旋”法国和突尼斯的纠纷而乘机进一步侵入北非，以取代法国的地位。
    同时，阿尔及利亚殖民战争的前途却越来愈渺茫。连法国的右翼报纸也担心要重蹈印度支那殖民战争的复辙。
    在这种情况下，以标榜和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的主张赢得一百个议席的社会党已经受到选民和广大普通党员越来越大的压力。在上星期这个党的全国委员会会议上，就有人提议社会党退出政府，并且要求召开党的特别会议来讨论阿尔及利亚问题。这个提案后来虽然被否决，但是连摩勒自己也不得不承认，要参加和支持盖伊阿政府已经越来越困难。
    被盖伊阿认为得不到它的支持政府就要垮台的独立党，在上星期的全国代表大会上责备盖伊阿的阿尔及利亚政策以及整个北非政策不够“强硬”。它以退出政府相威胁，要盖伊阿不得在美英“斡旋”下让步。它还要政府把更大的力量投入阿尔及利亚战争。在这方面，它得到社会共和党的大力支持。现在，这个党已经决定在25日再就是否退出政府联盟的问题作出决定。
    除阿尔及利亚问题外，盖伊阿政府联盟各政党在修改宪法和选举法方面难以调和的利害冲突，也加剧了法国目前的紧张政治气氛。这些政党都希望修改比较民主的宪法和选举法，从而使背离人民意志而且在议会中只获得少数支持的政府仍然可以长期执政，而且可以剥夺共产党在议会中的代表权。另一方面，特别是在选举法方面，怎样修改才对自己的党最为有利，各政党就有极其不同的考虑。盖伊阿政府在修改宪法问题上以信任票为武器，在23日清晨已经迫使国民议会二读通过了它的宪法修改草案。但是，政府获得的票数不足三分之二的多数；因此，按照规定，这个法案在共和国参议院通过后还要提交公民投票决定。而且，选举法是否能修改得让参加政府的所有政党都满意，也很难乐观。观察家们指出，曾经不止一次使法国政府倒台的修改选举法的道路，对盖伊阿政府来说，将仍然是坎坷险阻的道路。
    在盖伊阿政府加紧进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争、加紧实现修改宪法的阴谋的同时，法国形形色色的法西斯分子的气焰也越来越高。人们指出，法西斯分子的活动是受到当局上述反动行径直接、间接鼓励的。现在，法西斯暴徒的活动，已经从袭击法国共产党及其他民主组织的办事处和恐吓拥护共产党的选民发展到举行公开的集会和示威。13日下午巴黎警察包围议会，要求让法西斯头子当政，并且恣意辱骂议员，这就是一个典型的例子。而盖伊阿包庇对这种法西斯行动负有责任的内政部长布歇—莫努里，也就间接助长了法西斯分子的气焰。有消息说，由于受到法国人民的唾弃而在1953年宣布退出政治舞台的戴高乐，现在又跃跃欲试了。据说，他打算出来领导一个“强有力的政府”。
    法国共产党针对当前局势号召法国左翼力量团结一致击破法西斯阴谋，建立左翼政府，拯救法国。目前，拥护民主共和的人们正在越来越广泛地团结起来，予法西斯分子以强有力的回击。18日晚上巴黎劳动人民举行的好几万人的反法西斯大会和大游行，就是这方面的一个行动。这里的观察家强调，法国劳动人民和一切民主共和分子如果能够团结在共产党周围，结成坚强的统一战线，那么，他们就一定能够像1934年2月击败法西斯政变阴谋那样，粉碎今天法西斯分子的新阴谋。
