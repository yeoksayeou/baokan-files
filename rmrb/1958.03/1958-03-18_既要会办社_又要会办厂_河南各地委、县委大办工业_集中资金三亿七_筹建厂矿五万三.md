Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 17th, special dispatch by our newspaper reporter Lu Xiaoping: Since the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the "Six Main Principles" experience of Jiyuan County in developing local industry and promoted it throughout various regions and counties, a large number of local industries have been launched self-reliantly. Of the 59,000 industrial projects planned for construction in the province this year, more than 53,000 will be undertaken by special districts and counties using self-raised funds and the strength of agricultural cooperatives.

According to the plans of various counties, they will use two, three, four, or five years respectively to make the county's industrial output value catch up with or surpass agricultural output value, and build a network of agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing, a fertilizer manufacturing network, a power grid, a network for processing agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, and a transportation network of vehicles with rubber tires and rollers throughout the county. Various regions will also vigorously develop mining and smelting industries based on their local resource conditions.

Currently, the development of local industry has formed a massive movement in various special districts and counties. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees, all relevant units are "crossing the sea, each displaying their abilities." This year, the province is relying on the strength of all parties to find more than 420 million yuan in construction funds by all means, of which more than 370 million yuan is from special districts and counties. After reducing some and compressing all non-productive expenditures, special districts and counties have taken out a large sum of funds from local finances. Handicraft industries are using their own accumulation and voluntary investment from cooperative members to transition to cooperative factories or joint factories with the state. Unused welfare funds from institutions and a portion of surplus union dues from trade unions have also become investments in the construction of local industry. Agricultural cooperatives are also actively taking out surplus money to allow relevant departments to set up industries first, and then supply them with the machinery they need later.

Now, the CCP committees in various regions have placed the development of local industry on the agenda. The CCP Xuchang Prefectural Committee proposed: Grasp agriculture with one hand and industry with the other, so that industry and agriculture promote each other. The CCP Dengfeng County Committee put forward the slogan of action: "Must know how to run communes, and also know how to run factories."

    既要会办社  又要会办厂
    河南各地委、县委大办工业
    集中资金三亿七  筹建厂矿五万三
    本报特约新华社郑州17日电　新华社记者陆笑萍报道：河南省各专区、县普遍推广中共河南省委总结的济源县发展地方工业的“六主”经验自力更生地大量举办地方工业。全省计划在今年建设的五万九千个工业项目中，专区、县以自筹资金和运用农业社的力量举办的项目就占五万三千多个。
    按照各县的规划，他们将分别以两年、三年、四年或五年的时间，使县工业产值赶上或超过农业产值，在全县建成机械农具修配制造网、肥料制造网、电力网、农副业及土特产品加工网和车辆胶轮化、滚轴化的交通运输网。各地还根据本地区的资源条件，大力发展采掘冶炼工业。
    目前，发展地方工业已经在各专区、县形成了千军万马之势。在党委统一领导下，各有关单位都在“八仙过海，各显其能”。今年全省依靠各方面的力量，千方百计地挖掘出了四亿二千多万元建设资金，其中专区、县就占三亿七千多万元。各专区、县在削减了一些和压缩了一切非生产的开支后，从地方财政中拿出了一大笔资金。手工业运用自己的积累和社员自愿投资，过渡到合作工厂或和国家办联合工厂。机关用不完的福利费和工会一部分多余的工会会费等，也都成了建设地方工业的投资。农业合作社也积极把多余的钱拿出来，让有关部门先举办工业，以后再供应他们所需要的机器。
    现在，各地区的中共党委已经把发展地方工业提到议事日程上。中共许昌地委提出：一手抓农业，一手抓工业，使工农业互相促进。中共登封县委提出了“既会办社，又会办厂”的行动口号。
