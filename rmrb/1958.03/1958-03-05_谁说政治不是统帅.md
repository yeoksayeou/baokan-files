Who Says Politics Isn't the Commander?
    Kong Sang
    If anyone still says today that politics isn't the commander, please take a look at the experience of the Shanxi Daily's staff canteen in running its food service. Because the comrades of the Shanxi Daily's Administrative Welfare Section have emphasized conducting political and ideological work among the cooks, unimaginable miracles have occurred in this canteen: the cooks, with heightened awareness, have launched competitions, boldly innovated, studied techniques, and exchanged experiences, making the food very good and establishing a banner on the canteen work front in the entire Taiyuan city. The contradiction they used to find troublesome—that "more savings cannot guarantee enough to eat well"—has been resolved, and the contradiction that "being responsible to the state means not being responsible to the masses" has also been resolved.

    When we say that politics is the commander, we mean that it doesn't just play a role in one or several aspects, but in all aspects, in all work. After the rectification campaign that began last year, an unprecedented production upsurge has emerged across the country. In this regard, in major economic work, everyone has clearly seen the enormous power of politics. However, is politics the commander in all work? Not everyone is convinced of this point. Now, we have found the example of the Shanxi Daily's staff canteen. From the "ordinary" work of "cooking," which everyone is familiar with and most easily overlooks, the truth is once again convincingly proven: politics is indeed the commander of all work. No matter how "small" the place or "small" the matter, as long as political work is strengthened there, a new look, a new soul, and a new life will certainly emerge there.

    The Party Central Committee, in its instructions on launching the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, stated: "In the movement, it is necessary to prevent the tendency of 'seeing things but not people,' that is, only seeing the existing material conditions and not seeing the great subjective initiative and creativity of the masses." In the past, we often made this mistake in our work. We often only paid attention to business, not ideology; only paid attention to economics, not politics; only saw dead things, not living people. Doing things with this kind of view can only be done slower and worse. Indeed, the materialist worldview believes that matter is primary, and that productive forces are the most active and revolutionary factors in production. This view is undoubtedly correct. However, dialectical materialists also believe that people's thoughts and subjective initiative can, in turn, have a significant impact on matter, and that production relations can, in turn, have a significant impact on productive forces. To only acknowledge the former and not the latter is a metaphysical viewpoint, a mechanical materialist viewpoint, and runs counter to Marxism. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao often taught us: There are two methods for building socialism, one method is better and faster, and the other method is worse and slower; and they pointed out that these two methods are constantly in struggle. In fact, the struggle between these two working methods is the struggle between two ideological methods, the struggle between dialectics and metaphysics, the struggle between dialectical materialism and mechanical materialism, and the struggle between "fetish" worshippers who cannot see "people" and true Marxists. If we want to build socialism faster and better, we must abandon metaphysical methods and constantly apply dialectics in practical work. The work of the comrades in the Shanxi Daily's Administrative Welfare Section is in line with dialectics, so they have advanced their cause both quickly and well. This canteen is just a drop in the ocean in our entire cause, but through it, it gives us the most important experience for all our work.

    In the past, when everyone was not paying attention to the Great Leap Forward and was living a stable life, the disadvantages of doing work using metaphysical methods were not so obvious. Now that all walks of life are leaping forward, the decisive role that politics plays and the role that the dialectical method of work plays in who runs fast and who walks slowly are particularly clearly manifested. The example of the Shanxi Daily's staff canteen once again tells us: In the midst of the national Great Leap Forward, anyone who is unwilling to fall behind and is determined to create achievements that predecessors have not made must always remember the maxim "politics is the commander" and always use dialectics to guide their actions. If everyone in our country does this everywhere, the political and ideological strength gathered will form an unprecedented momentum in our country. This is also the "vast world" that is presented to us through a grain of millet, the Shanxi Daily's staff canteen.

    谁说政治不是统帅
    孔桑
    今天如果还有谁说政治不是统帅，就请他看看山西日报职工食堂办伙食的经验这篇文章吧。由于山西日报行政福利科的同志重视了对炊事人员进行政治思想工作，在这个食堂里就出现了为人们所想像不到的奇迹：觉悟提高了的炊事人员们，展开竞赛，大胆革新，钻研技术，交流经验，把伙食办得非常的好，在全太原市的食堂工作战线上树立了一面旗帜。过去他们引为苦恼的“节约多了就不能保证吃饱吃好”的矛盾解决了，“对国家负责就不能对群众负责”的矛盾也解决了。
    我们说政治是统帅，就是说，它不只是在一个方面或几个方面起作用，而是在所有的方面，在一切工作上都起作用。经过从去年开始的整风运动，全国出现了空前未有的生产高潮。在这方面，在重大的经济工作上，政治的巨大威力大家已经看得很清楚了。但是，政治是不是在一切工作上都是统帅呢？这一点却还不是所有的人都确信不疑。现在，我们找到了山西日报职工食堂这个例子。从“做饭”这件人人习知而又最容易被人忽视的“平凡”的工作上，再一次令人信服地证明了这个真理：政治确是一切工作的统帅。不管是任何“小”地方，“小”事情，只要在那里加强了政治工作，那里就一定会出现新的面貌，新的灵魂，新的生命。
    党中央在关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示中说：“在运动中，要防止‘见物不见人’的偏向，即只看到现有的物质条件，看不到伟大的群众主观能动性和创造性。”过去我们在工作中恰恰是好犯这种毛病。我们常常只注意业务，不注意思想；只注意经济，不注意政治；只看见死的物，不看见活的人。持着这样的观点去做事情，就只能做得慢一些，差一些。诚然，唯物主义的世界观认为物质是第一性的，生产力是生产中最活动最革命的因素，这个观点无疑是正确的。但是，辩证唯物主义者同时也认为人们的思想、人们的主观能动性反过来能对物质发生重大的影响，生产关系反过来能对生产力发生重大的影响。只承认前者，不承认后者，是形而上学的观点，是机械唯物论的观点，和马克思主义是背道而驰的。党中央和毛主席常常教导我们：建设社会主义有两种方法，一种方法好一些，快一些，一种方法差一些，慢一些；并且指出，这两种方法经常在斗争着。实际上，这两种工作方法的斗争，就是两种思想方法的斗争，就是辩证法同形而上学的斗争，辩证唯物论同机械唯物论的斗争，就是看不见“人”的“拜物教”教徒同真正的马克思主义者的斗争。我们要把社会主义建设得快一些，好一些，就要摒弃形而上学的方法，经常在实际工作中运用辩证法。山西日报行政福利科同志们的工作，是符合辩证法的，于是，他们就把自己的事业又快又好地推向前进了。这个食堂在我们的整个事业中只是沧海一粟，但是，透过它，却给我们的一切工作提示了最重要的经验。
    过去，当大家都不注意跃进，平平稳稳过日子的时候，用形而上学的方法做工作的坏处，还表现得不那么明显。现在行行业业都在跃进着，谁跑得快，谁走得慢，政治在里面所起的决定作用，辩证法的工作方法所起的作用，就特别鲜明地表现出来了。山西日报职工食堂的例子再一次告诉我们：在全国大跃进当中，谁要是不甘落后，并且有志于创造前人所没有做过的功绩，那他就要时时记住“政治是统帅”这句至理名言，时时用辩证法来指导自己的行动。如果我们全国人人、处处都这样做，这股政治上思想上的力量汇集起来，就会在我们的国家里形成一个历史上空前未有的动力。这也就是透过山西日报职工食堂这一粒粟，所展现在我们面前的“大千世界”。
