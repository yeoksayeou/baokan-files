Strike While the Iron Is Hot, Act Immediately
Shanghai Commercial System Promptly Improves Work

(Our Newspaper Shanghai, March 12th dispatch) Reporter Chen Xiangdong reports: Following the ten days of surging upsurge of airing views, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in the Shanghai commercial system has seen a mass upsurge of major rectification and major reform.

During the upsurge of airing views, the staff were full of enthusiasm. They proposed: Strike while the iron is hot, reform what can be reformed, and act immediately. The state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Steel Store, through mass debates on major issues, processed about 90% of the opinions from the big-character posters within three days. The staff of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, taking counter teams as units, categorized and lined up their own big-character posters, held team meetings to study and deal with them, and implemented the handling methods after evaluation by everyone. Using this method, this store had processed 80% of the opinions raised by 100,000 big-character posters by the afternoon of March 1st.

Many units that earnestly mobilized the masses to air views freely, and relied on the masses for major rectification and major reform, immediately saw a new atmosphere in business management and service attitude. In the past, the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store had to go through six checkpoints for purchasing goods, which took four or five days to be issued for sale at the counter. Now, the purchasing authority has been delegated to the counters, and the salespersons directly purchase the goods themselves. Goods purchased in the morning can be sold in the afternoon. This can also overcome the shortcomings of "goods not meeting the needs," and ensure that whatever is needed is purchased, and whatever is lacking is purchased, avoiding inventory backlog. In the past, when customers wanted to choose cloth at the Tilanqiao District Textile Products No. 4 Wholesale Department, the salespersons often said "no time" and were unwilling to do small transactions. Now, the service attitude has greatly improved. They treat large and small businesses the same, greet customers before they speak, and can patiently receive customers who pick and choose a lot.

### 趁热打铁　说干就干  上海商业系统及时改进工作

    趁热打铁　说干就干
    上海商业系统及时改进工作
    本报上海12日电　记者陈向东报道：紧接着十天汹涌澎湃的鸣放高潮，上海市商业系统的反浪费反保守运动，出现了群众性的大整大改高潮。
    在鸣放高潮中，职工干劲十足。他们提出：趁热打铁，能改就改，说干就干。国营上海市第一钢铁商店通过群众对重大问题的辩论，在三天内就处理大字报意见90％左右；国营上海市百货公司第一商店职工以柜台小组为单位，把自己的大字报分类排队，开小组会研究处理，处理办法交大家评议后实行。这个商店采用这一办法，到3月1日下午就将十万张大字报提出的意见处理了80％。
    许多认真发动群众大鸣大放，依靠群众大整大改的单位，在经营管理、服务态度等方面，立即出现了新气象。上海市第一百货商店，过去进货要过六个关口，需时四、五天，才能到柜发售，现在将进货权限下放到柜，由营业员自己直接进货，上午进货，下午就能卖了。这样还可以克服“货不对路”的缺点，作到要什么进什么，缺什么进什么，避免仓库积压。提篮桥区纺织品第四批发部，过去顾客要选布，营业员常说“没有空”，对小额交易不乐意做。现在服务态度大有改进，大小生意一样做，不等顾客开口就先打招呼，对挑拣得多的顾客也能耐心接待了。
