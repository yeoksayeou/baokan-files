　　Thinking it Through
　　After finishing editing the news about reasonable water usage in Shanxi, it evoked some thoughts:

　　In agricultural production, crops cannot grow without water, so we have vigorously developed water conservancy. But with water, can we just sit back and relax? The experience of Shanxi Province tells us that we can't! Unreasonable water usage will not only waste water but also degrade the quality of the land. If we use water reasonably and conserve water, we can guarantee increased production on existing irrigated land and expand the irrigated area. The comrades in Shanxi Province thought it through on this water issue and raised the problem in a timely manner. This spirit is worth learning from.

　　It is difficult for us to calculate, if every place correctly calculates the amount of water used, accurately grasps the timing of water usage, and avoids preventable waste, how much irrigated land could be increased out of thin air, and how much more grain could be produced. Therefore, this article started by the comrades in Shanxi should be followed up by rural work comrades in various places with outstanding writing.

    思前想后
    编完山西合理用水的消息，引起一点感想：
    在农业生产上，水少了长不出庄稼，因此，我们大兴了水利。但是有水了，我们是不是就能睡大觉了？山西省的经验告诉我们说，不行！用水不合理，不仅会浪费水，还会使土地质量变坏；要是合理用水，节约用水，那就可以保证原有水地增产，而且能扩大灌溉面积。山西省的同志，在水这件事上思前想后，及时提出了问题，这种精神值得学习。
    我们很难以计算出来，如果各个地方都把用水量正确计算一下，用水时间切实掌握好，避免可以避免的浪费，不知能凭空增加多少水地，多打多少粮食。因此，这篇由山西同志开了头的文章，应当由各地农村工作同志紧接着出色地写下去。
