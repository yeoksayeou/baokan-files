    "Qinghai Rice"
      The Xining Flour Mill has recently experimented with peeling highland barley, a special product of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, into rice grains that can be cooked into fragrant dry rice or porridge. This adds a new way of eating highland barley, which was previously only used for milling flour. Every 100 jin of dry highland barley can produce 92 to 93 jin of rice.
    Rice cooked from highland barley rice is even more fragrant than sorghum rice, and both locals and outsiders love to eat it, affectionately calling it "Qinghai Rice." The Xining Flour Mill plans to produce 50,000 jin per day starting in April.
