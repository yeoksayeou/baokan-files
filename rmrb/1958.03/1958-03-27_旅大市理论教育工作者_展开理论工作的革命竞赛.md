The theoretical workers in attendance were full of energy, formulating plans and proposing guarantees, setting off a high tide of the great leap forward and great emulation in theoretical work. On March 14th, the conference formed a mobilization meeting for the great leap forward in theoretical work throughout the city. The primary Party school of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee took the lead, proposing an initiative to theoretical workers throughout the city. Their slogan was: "With soaring revolutionary zeal, unwavering perseverance, unrelenting diligence, and the heroic spirit of the Red Army's Long March, resolutely eliminate bureaucratic airs, complacency, arrogance, delicacy, and bookishness, working hard for one year to fundamentally change theoretical work, and working hard for five years to make the theoretical work team both red and expert." With this goal, they are currently fully engaged in the double-anti movement, taking the good job of political and ideological work and publicity and mobilization as the starting point, and launching a socialist friendship emulation drive comparing Party spirit, drive, diligence, and effectiveness. This initiative immediately aroused enthusiastic responses from all comrades attending the meeting. Representatives from universities also proposed working hard for three years to make all backbone members both red and expert, and "five essentials" (thorough implementation of the teaching policy, ruthless self-transformation, adherence to labor training, timely publicity of current affairs and policies, and purposeful reading) and "five diligences" (diligent learning, diligent thinking, diligent consultation, diligent attendance in classes, and diligent investigation) and other specific action slogans. Representatives of theoretical education workers of cadres in service in the city put forward in their speeches: it is necessary to learn political theory well with the courage of Wu Song fighting tigers and the determination of Tang Seng to obtain scriptures.
