Grasp Agriculture with One Hand, Grasp Industry with the Other
    Shandong Provincial Party Committee Requires Party Committees Above County Level to Promote Parallel Advancement of Industry and Agriculture
    Provincial Local Industrial Output Value Can Surpass Agriculture in Five Years
    (Report from this newspaper) In accordance with the Party Central Committee's policy of "developing industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development heavy industry," from now on, Party committees at all levels above the county level in the province must grasp agriculture with one hand and industry with the other. This is the requirement recently put forward by Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, at a telephone conference of city and prefectural Party committee secretaries convened by the Provincial Party Committee.
    The telephone conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee was aimed at mobilizing the entire Shandong Party to promote a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production with the spirit of riding the wind and waves and galloping forward, and to ensure that the output value of local industry surpasses agriculture within five years, fundamentally changing the economic face of Shandong. In his report, Comrade Shu Tong said: At present, Shandong's agricultural production is in the midst of a great leap forward. The original requirement to achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule is likely to be achieved far ahead of schedule. Industry must catch up quickly and change the situation of lagging behind agricultural development without delay; only in this way can we guarantee and promote the great leap forward in agricultural production.
    After analyzing the conditions under which Shandong Province's industry will definitely be able to make a great leap forward, Comrade Shu Tong pointed out that there are obstacles to realizing a great leap forward in industrial production. This obstacle is mainly right-leaning conservative thinking. The manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking is, first of all, an insufficient understanding of the situation in which the great leap forward in agriculture requires industry to have a great leap forward. To this day, many regions have not devoted the necessary energy to leading industry; some regions have already felt the urgent need to develop industry, but they are not determined to rely on their own strength for hard work and construction, but attempt to rely on higher levels, rely on cities, and reach out upwards. Secondly, right-leaning conservative thinking is manifested in an insufficient understanding of the potential of local industry. Right-leaning conservative thinking is also manifested in considering the possibility of industrial development and calculating the speed of industrial growth only from the existing material conditions and equipment base. The conclusion is often that this is impossible and that is impossible. This kind of thinking is mainly a purely professional viewpoint, neglecting politics, and is a bias of "seeing things but not people." He criticized these ideas one by one and put forward opinions on how to achieve a great leap forward in industry.
    In order to strive to make the output value of local industry catch up with and surpass agriculture in the next five years, the Provincial Party Committee believes that in addition to actively transforming and developing existing enterprises and directly operating a number of large and medium-sized enterprises by the Provincial People's Committee, we must adopt the policy of "overall blooming," that is, every county should run industry, and every township should run industry. The Provincial Party Committee also put forward the guidelines and principles for the development of county and township industries, and pointed out in which aspects county and township industries should be developed. It requires all counties to strive to establish agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair networks, fertilizer manufacturing networks, agricultural and sideline product processing networks, electricity, and telephone networks and highway networks serving industrial and agricultural production within two or three years.
    Comrade Shu Tong's report particularly pointed out that the key to whether industrial production can make a great leap forward lies in leadership. Local Party committees and county Party committees should regard grasping agriculture with one hand and grasping industry with the other as two aspects of the same thing, which support and promote each other. The situation in which some regions only grasp agriculture and relax industry must be changed first. The report also specifically stipulated that in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in industry, in addition to the fact that each city should correspondingly strengthen its leadership over industry, among the secretaries and commissioners of the local Party committees, there should be a special person in charge of industry. The industrial and transportation departments of the local Party committees should be established separately on the principle of streamlining. Among the county Party committee secretaries and county heads, there should also be someone specifically in charge of industry; the county Party committee and the county People's Committee should separately establish industrial and transportation work departments and industrial bureaus.

    一手抓农业　一手抓工业
    山东省委要求县以上党委促进工农业并肩前进
    全省地方工业产值五年可赶过农业
    本报讯　根据党中央提出的“在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业与发展农业同时并举”的方针，从现在起，全省县以上各级党委必须一手抓农业，一手抓工业。——这是中共山东省委第一书记舒同最近在省委召开的市、地委书记电话会议上提出的要求。
    山东省委召开的这次电话会议，是为了动员山东全党以乘风破浪、万马奔腾的气魄，促进工农业生产大跃进，保证地方工业的产值在五年内赶过农业，从根本上改变山东经济的面貌。舒同同志在报告中说：目前山东省农业生产正处在大跃进中，原订的提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要指标的要求，有可能大大提前实现。工业必须急起直追，刻不容缓地改变落后于农业发展的局面；只有这样，才能保证并促进农业生产的大跃进。
    舒同同志在分析了山东省的工业一定能大跃进的条件以后指出，要实现工业生产大跃进，不是没有阻力的。这种阻力主要是右倾保守思想。右倾保守思想的表现，首先是对农业大跃进要求工业必须有一个大跃进的形势认识不足。至今许多地区还没有拿出必要的精力来领导工业；有的地区已经感觉到发展工业的迫切需要，但又不是下决心依靠自己的力量艰苦建设，而是企图依赖上级，依赖城市，向上伸手。其次，右倾保守思想表现在对地方工业的潜力认识不足。右倾保守思想还表现在只从现有物质条件设备基础来考虑工业发展的可能性，计算工业增长的速度。结论往往是这也不可能做到，那也不可能做到。这种思想主要是单纯业务观点，忽视政治所造成的，是“见物不见人”的偏向。他对这些思想都一一作了批判，并且提出了如何实现工业大跃进的意见。
    为了争取在今后五年内使地方工业的产值赶上并超过农业，省委认为，除积极地改造和发展现有企业以及由省人民委员会直接主办若干大、中型企业外，必须采取“全面开花”的方针，即县县办工业，乡乡办工业。省委还提出了发展县、乡工业的方针、原则，指出县、乡工业应从哪几方面发展。要求各县在二、三年内争取普遍建立起农业机械制造、修理网，肥料制造网，农副业加工网，电力以及为工农业生产服务的电话网，公路网。
    舒同同志的报告中特别指出，工业生产能否大跃进，关键问题在于领导。各地委、县委应把一面抓农业、一面抓工业看作是一件事情的两方面，是互相支援、互相促进的。部分地区只抓农业放松了工业的情况首先必须改变。报告中还具体规定：为适应工业大跃进的需要，除各市应相应地加强对工业的领导外，各地委书记及专员中，都应该有专人分管工业。地委工业交通部应在精简的原则下单独成立。各县委书记、县长中也应有人专管工业；县委和县人民委员会应分别成立工业交通工作部和工业局。
