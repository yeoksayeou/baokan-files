    On the Eve of Elections
    By Our Correspondent Dai Feng
    These days, Moscow, the capitals of the Soviet republics, cities, and villages are all enveloped in a joyous, festive election atmosphere. The tens of thousands of election propaganda stations set up in streets, offices, factory workshops, and collective farms are working very actively. Here, voters can hear reports on the Soviet electoral system and the construction achievements of the Soviet Union over the past forty years. Here, voters participate in the nomination of representatives. For more than a month, voters in various electoral districts throughout the Soviet Union have elected thousands of social activists, workers, farmers, scholars, teachers, and actors, both Party members and non-Party members, who are loved by the people, as candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet.
    Like all Soviet people, Muscovites have nominated their most respected leaders of the Party and government as candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet. Comrades Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Kirichenko, Furtseva, Shvernik, and others have been unanimously nominated as candidates for deputies in various electoral districts of Moscow. The scientific achievements and life story of the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, are being widely publicized, and scientists in the capital have unanimously nominated him as a candidate for deputy. Fetrova, an advanced producer from the Three Hills Textile Factory, has been nominated as a candidate for the first time. In the Sverdlov Electoral District, voters once again nominated Tarasova, a People's Artist from the Moscow Art Theater, as a candidate for the electoral district. Her long stage career has brought immortal glorious achievements to the people and to art, and her portrait is posted on every street and alley. Among the nationally renowned candidates for deputies are also Churshunov, a famous Ural steel rolling expert, Vichiduk, a production team leader of the "Dear Ukraine" Collective Farm in the Kiev region who has twice been awarded the title of Hero of Labor, and Bilin, a model middle school teacher from Tallinn.
    In this election of deputies to the Supreme Soviet, many new electoral districts and electoral sub-districts have emerged throughout the Soviet Union. This signifies the rapid growth and development of new urban and rural construction in the Soviet Union. Ukhtha, the central city of the Komi Autonomous Republic, is one of the new electoral districts. In recent years, this electoral district has become a city of oil and gas industries. Yagiyel, in the Uzbek Republic, which means "new land" in Russian, is also one of the new electoral districts. It has been built into a metallurgical industrial base here. Moscow has also newly established many electoral sub-districts. In the southwestern district of Moscow, where large-scale construction is underway, many new high-rise residential buildings have been built one after another in recent years, and hundreds of thousands of working people have moved in. Not long ago, we met a voter, Ivanov, in an electoral district in southwestern Moscow. He happily told reporters: "If you have lived in Moscow for four years, then you will know for yourself that four years ago this was still a wasteland. Now, there are hundreds of buildings! It has become the city center! This is the best proof of the Party's concern for us working people..."
    In the days when the election day is approaching, the candidates for deputies are the busiest. In addition to meeting with voters in the electoral districts, they also receive voters and discuss various issues with them. Soviet Party and government leaders, like ordinary candidates for deputies, also meet with voters in various electoral districts. These meetings are full of a warm atmosphere of unity.
    During its four-year term, the Fourth Supreme Soviet led the Soviet people in achieving great achievements in economic construction for workers and peasants and in improving the material living standards of the people. These four years were four years of great creation: the construction of the world's first atomic power station, the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the successful launching of two artificial satellites all prove that Soviet industry and science have developed to a new stage. In these four years, more than three thousand giant industrial enterprises have been built throughout the Soviet Union. If we compare some of the main industrial products in 1954 with those in 1957, the growth rate is staggering: pig iron production increased by 35%, steel increased by 34%, coal increased by 44%, oil increased by 80%, and electricity increased by 56%. The achievement of these achievements, in addition to proving that the Party and the government have consistently adhered to the completely correct policy of developing heavy industry, also proves that the Soviet Party and government's implementation of enhancing the power of the Union Republics to lead economic construction, reorganizing the management of industry and construction, and other major measures is completely correct. Agricultural production achievements are also very significant. Due to the vigorous reclamation of wasteland in Siberia and Kazakhstan, the sown area in 1957 increased by 36 million hectares compared to 1953. 1956 became the year with the highest grain harvest in history. The production of milk, fats, and meat is increasing day by day under the call to catch up with and surpass the United States in per capita terms. The great achievements of Soviet industrial and agricultural production in the past four years show that the Soviet Union has a more solid and consolidated material and technical foundation for building communism, and has taken another big step forward on the road to communist society. At the same time, it undeniably demonstrates the great superiority of the Soviet socialist system.
    "The Soviet Party and government have no other interests except the interests of the people." This is a sentence often heard at every voter meeting in Moscow. On the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity, the material life of the Soviet people has been greatly improved. In these four years, the Party and the government adjusted the wages of employees, especially increasing the wages of employees who had low wages in the past, for which the Soviet government spent an additional 8 billion rubles per year. Now, 17 million people are enjoying doubled pensions. Industrial enterprises throughout the Soviet Union are gradually implementing a seven-hour work system. Prices have also been reduced many times in succession, and large-scale housing construction has been carried out. The Soviet people are living an increasingly happy life.
    Voters actively participate in the election campaign with the attitude of masters of the country. They elect people whom they trust and who can work for the country and the people to the Supreme Soviet.

    选举前夕
    本报记者　戴枫
    这些天，莫斯科、苏联各共和国首都、城市和乡村，都笼罩在充满欢乐的选举节日气氛里。设立在街道、机关、工厂车间和集体农庄里的几万个选举宣传鼓动站，工作得非常活跃。在这里，选民们可以听到关于苏维埃选举制度、苏联四十年来的建设成就等问题的报告。在这里，选民们参加了代表候选人的提名。一个多月来，全苏联各选区的选民已把上千个被人民所爱戴的党与非党的社会活动家、工人、农民、学者、教师、演员推选为最高苏维埃代表的候选人了。
    像全苏联人民一样，莫斯科人把最敬爱的党和政府的领袖们，推举为最高苏维埃代表候选人。赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、基里钦科、福尔采娃、什维尔尼克等同志，已一致被莫斯科各选区分别提名为代表候选人。苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫的科学工作成就和他的生平，被广泛的介绍着，首都的科学工作者一致推举他为代表候选人。三山纺织厂先进生产者费特洛娃第一次被提名为候选人。在斯维尔德洛夫选区，选民们又一次推举了莫斯科艺术剧院的人民演员塔拉索娃为选区候选人。她的长期舞台劳动，给人民、给艺术带来了不朽的光辉业绩，她的肖像张贴在各个大街、小巷。全苏闻名的代表候选人中还有乌拉尔著名的轧钢能手丘尔雪诺夫，基辅州“亲爱的乌克兰”集体农庄的生产队长、两次荣获劳动英雄称号的维契都克，塔林城的模范中学女教师比琳等人。
    在这一届最高苏维埃代表的选举中，苏联各地出现了许多新选举区和选举分区。这标志着苏联新的城市和农村建设的迅速成长和发展。像科米自治共和国的中心城市乌赫塔，就是新选区之一。这个选区近年来已成为石油和煤气工业城市了。乌兹别克共和国的雅吉叶尔，俄文意思是“新地”，也是新选区之一。这里已建成为冶金工业基地。莫斯科市也新设了许多选举分区。进行着大规模建设的莫斯科西南区，最近几年大批高层新住宅一幢接一幢地盖成了，那里新迁进了成千上万的劳动人民。不久前，我们在莫斯科西南区的一个选区中，见到了选民依万诺夫。他高兴地告诉记者说：“如果你在莫斯科已住了四年，那末你自己会知道，四年前这里还是一片荒地。现在呢，是成百幢的大楼！这里已成为市中心了啊！这是党关心我们劳动人民的最好说明……。”
    在选举日快要来临的日子里，代表候选人是最忙碌的了。他们除了在选区同选民们会见外，还要接见选民，同他们讨论各种问题。苏联党政领导人同普通代表候选人一样，也在各选区同选民见了面。这些会见都充满了团结一致的热烈气氛。
    第四届最高苏维埃在任期的四年里，领导着苏联人民在工农经济建设与提高人民物质生活水平上已取得了巨大成就。这四年是巨大创造的四年：建成世界第一个原子能发电站，制成洲际弹道导弹，以及成功地发射了两颗人造卫星，都证明苏联工业和科学已发展到了一个新的阶段。这四年里，全苏各地建起了三千多个巨型工业企业。如果把1954年的一些主要工业产品与1957年相比较的话，增长速度是惊人的：生铁产量增加了35％、钢增加了34％、煤增加了44％、石油增加了80％、电力增加了56％。这些成就的取得，除了证明党和政府一贯坚持执行着的发展重工业方针的完全正确外，同时也证明苏联党和政府所实行的提高加盟共和国领导经济建设的权力，改组对工业和建设的管理等重大措施的完全正确。农业生产成就也十分显著。由于在西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦大力开垦荒地，使1957年的播种面积比1953年增加了三千六百万公顷。19 56年成为历史上粮食收获量最高的一年。牛奶、油脂、肉类的产量，在按人口平均计算赶上并超过美国的号召下，与日俱增。四年来苏联工农业生产的巨大成就，表明了苏联在建设共产主义的物质技术基础更为雄厚、巩固，在走向共产主义社会的大道上又向前迈进了一大步。同时也无可争辩地表明了苏维埃社会主义制度的巨大优越性。
    “除了人民的利益，苏联党和政府没有别的利益。”这是在莫斯科每次选民集会上经常听到的一句话。在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，苏联人民的物质生活又有了很大的改善。这四年里，党和政府调整了职工的工资，特别是提高了过去低工资的职工的工资数，为此苏联政府每年多支出了八十亿卢布。现在，一千七百万人享受着提高了一倍的养老金。全苏各地工业企业在逐步实行七小时工作制。物价也曾连续多次降低，并大批建造住房。苏联人民过着越来越幸福的生活。
    选民们都以主人翁的态度积极参加选举运动。他们把自己信任的、能为国家为人民办事的人选入最高苏维埃。
