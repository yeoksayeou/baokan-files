By Every Possible Means to Guarantee a Bumper Harvest
Henan Province Formulates Five Measures for Increasing Agricultural Production
Hong'an County Promotes Ten Experiences for High Peanut Yields

This newspaper reports that the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of the first secretaries of regional and municipal Party committees, focusing on how to mobilize all Party members and the people of the province to guarantee a bumper harvest in agriculture by every possible means.

The meeting believed that the province has now seen a situation of comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction, and the key to promoting a comprehensive great leap forward lies in first focusing on agriculture to ensure a bumper harvest this year. In order to guarantee a bumper harvest this year, especially the summer harvest, the meeting demanded: First, continue to vigorously pursue water conservancy, striving to bring the province's irrigated land to 100 million mu by the end of May. In order to prevent the possible occurrence of greater water and drought disasters, all localities should raise water storage standards to ensure that rainfall of 300 to 500 millimeters does not cause runoff; vigorously tap mountain springs and groundwater, with the province undertaking at least 300 flows; further consider relying on the masses to build medium-sized water conservancy projects as the backbone of water conservancy construction. To fully utilize the benefits of existing water conservancy projects, it is now necessary to do everything possible to mobilize the masses to vigorously manufacture or improve various water-lifting tools. Second, launch a concentrated attack on spring irrigation of wheat, striving to ensure the irrigation of 50 million mu of wheat in the shortest possible time. In areas with good water conservancy conditions, strive to irrigate twice. Third, vigorously promote the smoked soil fertilizer experience of Xinxiang Prefecture, tap all fertilizer sources, and ensure that each mu is applied with 20,000 jin of coarse fertilizer this year. Wheat should be universally top-dressed at least once. Fourth, expand the area under rice cultivation, aiming to reach 15 million mu in the province this year. Fifth, expand the planting area of sweet potatoes and launch a large-scale high-yield movement on 10 million mu, aiming for 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu.

The meeting also decided that cities should send technical workers to the countryside and construction sites to help repair tools. It demanded that factories do everything possible to rush-produce water-lifting tools and improve old-style farm implements. It also decided to organize socialist large-scale cooperation to support a bumper harvest in agriculture.

This newspaper reports that in order to ensure the realization of the county's leap forward plan of achieving an average yield of 850 jin per mu and striving for 1,000 jin on 47,000 mu of peanuts in the county, the Hong'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a symposium of production experts from eight high-yielding peanut agricultural cooperatives, deeply analyzed the high-yield experiences of these cooperatives, and formulated ten concrete measures. Now, all agricultural cooperatives in the county that plant peanuts have revised their plans and measures based on these measures and have universally launched peanut preparation activities.

These measures require: deep plowing and multiple plowing, improving the soil, cultivating soil fertility; applying sufficient base fertilizer, applying fertilizer in layers, applying mixed fertilizer; intercropping peanuts in wheat rows, fertilizing wheat and forests, promoting the double cropping of peanuts and wheat; carefully selecting purebred upright peanuts and eliminating hybrids; dense planting according to local conditions, evenly broadcasting seeds, and eliminating pests and diseases, etc.

These measures have specific requirements and operating regulations. For example, the depth of plowing, the amount of fertilizer applied, the number of selected seeds, the number of dense plantings, the number and timing of weeding, and the season for field inspection and evaluation, etc.

Last year, Hong'an County still achieved a large-scale bumper harvest record of an average yield of 600 jin per mu despite suffering from 80 days of severe autumn drought, and many typical examples of high-yield were emerged. Among the more than 700 agricultural cooperatives in the county, 128 cooperatives achieved an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu, and more than 3,000 mu achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin. The emergence of these high-yield records is precisely the result of these agricultural cooperatives strictly implementing various comprehensive technical measures on this part of the land.

    千方百计保证大丰收
    河南省制定农业增产五项措施
    红安县推广十项花生丰产经验
    本报讯　中共河南省委最近召开了地、市委第一书记会议，着重讨论了如何动员全体党员和全省人民，千方百计保证农业大丰收的问题。
    会议认为，目前全省已经出现了社会主义建设全面大跃进的形势，促进全面大跃进的关键在于首先抓好农业，保证今年农业大丰收。为了保证今年农业大丰收，特别是夏季大丰收，会议要求：首先要继续大干水利化，争取在5月底以前全省水浇地达到一亿亩。为了防止可能发生更大的水、旱灾害，各地要提高蓄水标准，保证一次降雨三百公厘到五百公厘不发生径流；要大力挖山泉和地下水，全省至少要搞三百个流量；还要进一步考虑依靠群众力量兴办中型水利工程，作为水利建设的骨干。为充分发挥现有水利工程的效益，目前要想尽一切办法，发动群众，大力制造或改良各种提水工具。其次，要突击小麦春浇。力争在最短期内保证浇麦五千万亩。在水利条件好的地方，要争取浇两遍。第三，大力推广新乡专区的熏土肥经验，挖掘一切肥源，保证今年每亩施粗肥两万斤。小麦至少要普遍施追肥一次。第四，扩大水稻面积，今年全省要达到一千五百万亩。第五，扩大红薯种植面积，并要开展一个一千万亩亩产万斤红薯的大面积丰产运动。
    会议还确定城市要派技术工人下乡、上工地，帮助修理工具。要求各厂想尽一切办法赶制提水工具和改良旧式农具。并决定组织社会主义大协作，支援农业大丰收。
    本报讯　湖北红安县为保证实现全县四万七千亩花生平均每亩产量达到八百五十斤、争取千斤的跃进计划，中共红安县委会最近召开了八个花生丰产社的生产能手座谈会，深入分析这些社的丰产经验，制订了十项具体措施。现在全县所有种植花生的农业社，都根据这一措施修订自己的规划和措施，普遍地开展了花生的备耕活动。
    这些措施要求：深耕多耕，改良土壤，培养地力；施足底肥，分层施肥，施混合肥；麦行花生，麦林施肥，促进花生、麦子两熟；精选直立花生纯种，消灭杂种；因地密植，均播匀播，消灭病虫害等。
    这些措施都有具体地要求和操作规定。例如，耕作的深度、施肥的数量、颗选种籽的粒数、密植的株数、除草的次数时间、田间检查评比的季节等等。
    红安县去年在秋季苦旱八十天的情况下，仍然获得了平均每亩产量达到六百斤的大面积的丰产纪录，并出现了许多高额丰产典型。全县七百多农业社中，有一百二十八个社平均亩产八百斤以上，还有三千多亩平均亩产千斤。这些高产纪录的出现，正是这些农业社对这部分土地严格贯彻执行各项技术综合措施的结果。
