Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 28th: Indonesian mass organizations continued to issue statements and hold demonstrations on the 27th, opposing the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The Central Committee of the All-Indonesia Veterans Association, representing 300,000 members, issued a statement calling on the Indonesian government, the leadership of the armed forces, and Indonesian patriots to immediately take effective measures to stop the interference activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and to investigate and shut down the organizations of the Chiang Kai-shek clique that openly assist Indonesian rebels.

The Cooperation Association of Groups Fighting to Defend the Unity of the Republic of Indonesia in Sumatra strongly protested the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's interference in Indonesia's internal affairs and demanded the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. A resolution passed by this organization has been delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia by a delegation.

Datuak Madjo Basa, chairman of the Minangkabau Association (Note: The Minangkabau people are the main ethnic group in the West Sumatra region controlled by the rebel group), told the press on the 27th that the current turmoil in Indonesia was instigated by Western colonialism, or more precisely, by the United States. The rebel group currently confronting the Indonesian people is a traitorous group.

The Jakarta Veterans Students' Organization for the Struggle for Independence and the Jakarta Regional Branch of the People's Youth League sent delegations to demonstrate in front of the U.S. Ambassador's residence, condemning the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's interference in Indonesia's internal affairs and demanding the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

It is reported that slogans condemning the United States for aiding the rebel group were written on the walls of the United States Information Service building in Surabaya.
