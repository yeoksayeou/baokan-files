    "Doing" and "Doing Well"
    No matter what work is undertaken, it must be done well. If one only does something without doing it well, the result is equivalent to not having done it at all, or even worse.
    It is understood that in the four special districts of Liaocheng, Huimin, Changwei, and Laiyang in Shandong Province, thirty-five counties have experienced the deaths of over 130,000 pigs since the beginning of winter (80% of which were piglets). In some counties, the phenomenon of pig deaths has not stopped even now. Calling on and mobilizing the masses to raise pigs is originally a good thing. However, merely "calling on" and "mobilizing" is not enough to raise pigs well; a lot of meticulous work must be done. While mobilizing the masses to raise pigs, it is certainly necessary to get through to the masses' thinking and solve problems such as piglet supply and funding. After the masses raise pigs in large numbers, it is also necessary to lead the masses to solve a series of problems in feeding, disease prevention, and raising. The aforementioned areas in Shandong Province have precisely lacked concrete leadership in the raising and protection of pigs, resulting in a large number of deaths. As a result, not only has the goal of developing production and increasing income not been achieved, but the masses have suffered unnecessary economic losses, which may even affect their enthusiasm for raising pigs in the future.
    Why was the raising and protection work not done well after the large-scale development of pig production? There may be many specific reasons, but if we examine it from the perspective of ideological style, it is directly related to the bureaucratic air and arrogance of some leading cadres. It cannot be denied that there are indeed some cadres who are only accustomed to issuing general calls and are not good at doing concrete organizational work. There are also some people who are easily satisfied with the numerical achievements on reports and do not pay much attention to the problems that may occur after the work is carried out. The fact of pig deaths in some areas of Shandong tells us: to do something well, we must be conscientious and diligent at the beginning. Even after the work is carried out, and even after achievements have been made, we cannot be careless or develop the idea that "everything is fine." We must pay close attention to the new problems that will inevitably arise in new situations, and take new measures to address these problems, so that we can see things through from beginning to end and do things well.

### “做”和“做好”

    “做”和“做好”
    不管做一件什么工作，一定要把它做好。如果只是做一下，而不把它做好，结果等于没有做，甚至更坏。
    据了解，山东省聊城、惠民、昌潍、莱阳四个专区三十五个县，入冬以来死猪十三万多头（其中80％是小猪），有的县死猪现象直到现在还没有停止。号召和发动群众养猪，本来是件好事。但是只有“号召”和“发动”是不能把猪养好的，必须做很多细致的工作才行。在发动群众养猪的时候，固然需要打通群众的思想，解决猪仔和资金等问题；在群众大量养猪以后，还需要领导群众解决饲料、防疫和育养工作中的一系列问题。山东省上述地区正是因为对猪的养育和保护工作缺少具体领导，因而发生大量死亡现象，结果不但达不到发展生产和增加收入的目的，反而使群众遭受了不应有的经济损失，甚至影响了今后养猪的积极性。
    为什么在大量发展生猪生产之后，育养和保护工作没有做好呢？其中具体原因可能很多，若是从思想作风上来检查，就和某些领导干部的官气和骄气有直接关系。不容否认，现在的确还有一些这样的干部，他们只是习惯于发出一般的号召，而不善于做具体的组织工作；也有的人容易满足于表报上的数字成绩，对于工作开展以后可能发生的问题则不大注意。山东部分地区生猪死亡的事实告诉我们：要做好一件事，开始的时候固然需要兢兢业业，工作开展以后，甚至已经取得了成绩，也不能粗心大意，更不能产生“万事大吉”的思想。我们要密切注意新情况下必然会发生的新问题，针对这些问题，采取新措施，才能善始善终，把事情做好。
