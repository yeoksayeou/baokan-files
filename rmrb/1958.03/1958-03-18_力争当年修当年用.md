Strive to Repair and Use in the Same Year

    China's newly built water conservancy projects can increase the irrigated area by more than 200 million mu. This is a great victory. However, to ensure that the newly built water conservancy projects immediately play a role in production this year, a great deal of effort is still needed.
    First, a large number of new projects require people who understand the business and technology to manage and use them. This requires large-scale training of farmer water conservancy technical personnel to manage and use water conservancy projects. Taking Shaanxi Province as an example, 500,000 people need to be trained this spring. How to train so many people in a short period of time? Shaanxi Province provides a good approach, which is to organize old irrigation areas to support new irrigation areas. Now, Shaanxi Province is drawing a large number of farmer water conservancy cadres from old irrigation areas to form many technical guidance groups, which are sent to various counties in new irrigation areas to teach technology and guide spring irrigation. The old irrigation areas are also preparing to hold small-scale technical teaching sessions to train key irrigation management cadres. This mass technical teaching and training activity is a new development of the mass line working method since the large-scale water conservancy construction last winter. If we want to train millions or even tens of millions of water conservancy talents across the country in a very short period of time, this is the only correct and effective path, and it should be vigorously promoted everywhere.
    Secondly, it is also necessary to overcome the difficulty of insufficient water lifting tools. This year, 1.5 million horsepower of pumping machinery will be sent to the countryside, which is a strong support from the state to the farmers. In order to give full play to the effectiveness of pumping machinery, in addition to the need to train technical personnel to manage and use the machinery, it is also necessary to ensure mechanical repair and parts supply. In addition to pumping machinery, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to use local materials to manufacture simple water lifting tools in large quantities. Recently, simple water lifting machinery with low cost and high efficiency, created by the masses themselves, is constantly emerging in various places. This is the bud of a technical revolution that is bound to occur on the basis of social revolution. The leading organs should actively support and give specific guidance to the creativity of the masses, and at the same time, they should organize relevant departments to promptly identify and promote the water lifting tools created by the masses so that they can play a role this year.
    In addition to the issues of people and tools, there are many specific tasks that must be done well. For example, leveling the land and building sufficient branch canals are very important. Last summer and autumn, many newly built water conservancy projects could not be used or could not be fully utilized because this work did not keep up. This year, it must be done well. In some places, due to soil conditions, water needs to be applied with alkaline fertilizer (such as in southeastern Shanxi), so it is necessary to simultaneously develop alkaline water production accordingly. In order to manage and use water conservancy projects well, engineering management agencies and usage systems should be established immediately. In addition, in terms of irrigation, it is also necessary to vigorously promote advanced irrigation technology, use water rationally, save water, and improve irrigation capacity.
    In order to maximize the benefits of water conservancy projects, it is also necessary to organize cooperation between regions and between cooperatives, because a river or a water source often involves the interests of many regions and cooperatives. The allocation of water sources upstream and downstream, and the order of water use, all need to be considered comprehensively and arranged fairly; if the abundance of water sources in two neighboring areas is different, it is also necessary to break the boundaries of administrative divisions, jointly build a water conservancy irrigation network, adjust surpluses and shortages, and expand benefits. This newspaper today publishes the practice of Fushun County, Sichuan Province, breaking the boundaries of townships and cooperatives, and comprehensively planning a water conservancy network so that every mountain and every mu of land can use water. This practice is worth learning from all over the country. Now, inventions and creations in water conservancy construction are springing up like mushrooms after a rain in various places, and good experiences are emerging one after another. Only by widely developing cooperation in various forms can these new creations break through the narrow scope of one place and one cooperative and become the common wealth of hundreds of millions of people in vast areas.

    力争当年修当年用

    我国新修成的水利工程，可以增加灌溉面积两亿多亩。这是一个很大的胜利。但要保证新修的水利工程在今年生产上立即发挥效益，却还需要作很大的努力。
    首先，大量的新工程需要有懂得业务和技术的人来管理和使用。这就需要大规模地培养训练管理使用水利工程的农民水利技术人材。以陕西一省计算，今春需要训练五十万人。怎样在短时期内培养这么多人呢？陕西省提供了一个很好的做法，就是组织老灌区支援新灌区。现在，陕西省正在抽调大批老灌区的农民水利干部，组成许多技术指导组，分别派往新灌区的各县去传授技术，指导春灌。老灌区还准备举行小型的技术传授会，训练主要的灌溉管理干部。这种群众性的技术传授与训练活动，是去冬大兴水利以来群众路线工作方法的新发展。要想在很短的期间在全国培养出几百万甚至千万以上的水利人才，这是唯一正确和有效的道路，各地都应当大力提倡。
    其次，还要克服提水工具不足的困难。今年将有一百五十万马力的抽水机械下乡，这是国家对于农民的一个有力的支援。为了充分发挥抽水机械的效能，除了需要训练管理使用机械的技术人员以外，还要保证机械修配和零件供应。除了抽水机械，还要发动群众就地取材，大量制造简易的提水工具。最近期间群众自己创造的成本低而效率较高的简易提水机械，正在各地不断涌现。这是在社会革命基础之上必然要发生的技术革命的萌芽，对群众的创造，领导机关应该积极扶植并给以具体领导，同时要组织有关部门对群众创造的提水工具及时鉴定和推广，使它们能在今年发挥作用。
    在人和工具的问题之外，还有许多具体工作必须做好。比如平整土地和修筑足够的毛渠，就十分重要。去年夏秋有许多新修成的水利工程用不上，或不能充分利用，就是因为这个工作没有跟上。今年必须切实做好。有一些地方因为土质关系，浇了水需要施滷肥（如晋东南），这就必须同时相应地发展滷水生产。为了把水利工程管好用好，应当立即建立工程管理机构和使用制度。此外，在灌溉方面，也需要大力推广先进的灌溉技术，合理用水，节约用水，提高灌溉能力。
    为了最大限度地发挥水利工程的效益，还需要组织地区之间和合作社之间的协作，因为一条河流，一处水源，往往关系好多地区和合作社的利害。上下游水源的分配，用水的先后，都需要统筹兼顾，公平安排；邻近两地水源多寡不同，也需要打破行政区划的界限，共建一个水利灌溉网，调剂余缺，扩大效益。本报今天发表的四川富顺县打破乡、社界限，全面规划水利网，使每个山头，每亩地都能用到水。这种做法很值得各地学习。现在各地水利建设中的发明创造如雨后春笋，好的经验迭出不穷。只有用各种形式广泛发展协作，才能使这些新创造冲破一地一社的狭小范围，变成广大地区千百万人民的共同财富。
