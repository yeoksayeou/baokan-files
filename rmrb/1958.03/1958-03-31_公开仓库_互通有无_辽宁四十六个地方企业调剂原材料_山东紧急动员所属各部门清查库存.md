　　Open Warehouses, Sharing Resources
　　46 Local Enterprises in Liaoning Adjust Raw Materials
　　Shandong Urgently Mobilizes All Departments to Inventory Stockpiles
　　This newspaper reports: According to the Liaoning Daily, 46 local industrial enterprises in Liaoning Province have signed 135 contracts for mutual adjustment of materials, mutually adjusting nearly 20 kinds of materials such as steel, iron pipes, steel plates, scrap copper, ball bearings, and cement, amounting to more than 300,000 yuan.

　　Jin County, Xinbin County, and Suizhong County lacked ball bearings and scrap copper to support agricultural production of rice threshers and repair of pesticide sprayers. They could not buy them anywhere. This time, they found 278 sets of ball bearings in fraternal units, which can be used to assemble 139 rice threshers. The Xinjin County and Haicheng County machinery factories producing universal feed crushers for agricultural cooperatives also resolved the shortage of 25 mm thick steel plates through material adjustment.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 30th: The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued an "Emergency Notice on Inventorying Stockpiled Raw Materials, Equipment, and Other Materials to Support the Great Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture" on the 28th to directly subordinate organs of the province, all departments of the central government stationed in Shandong, and Party and government departments at all levels in the province. The notice requires all departments to overcome departmentalism and conservative thinking, conduct a thorough inventory of all sizes of warehouses and discarded idle raw materials and equipment, and concentrate them for unified allocation. Private disposal is not allowed, to ensure that these materials and equipment are given priority for the production of irrigation and drainage machinery and other most urgently needed areas. The notice requires that each department and region have a responsible cadre in charge of this work, and establish a specialized organization to rapidly carry out this work.

    公开仓库　互通有无
    辽宁四十六个地方企业调剂原材料
    山东紧急动员所属各部门清查库存
    本报讯　据辽宁日报报道：辽宁省已有四十六个地方工业企业签订了一百三十五份互相调剂物资的合同，互相调剂钢材、铁管、钢板、杂铜、滚珠轴承、水泥等近二十种材料，金额达三十多万元。
    锦县、新宾、绥中县为了支援农业增产打稻机和修理农药喷雾器缺少滚珠轴承、杂铜，到处奔波都买不到，这次在兄弟单位找到了滚珠轴承二百七十八套，可装打稻机一百三十九台。新金县和海城县的机械厂为农业社生产的万能饲料粉碎机，缺少二十五公厘厚的钢板，也通过物资调剂得到解决。
    据新华社济南30日电　中共山东省委和省人民委员会于28日向省直属机关、中央驻山东各部门、地方各级党和政府部门发出“清查库存原材料、设备等物资支援工农业大跃进”的紧急通知。要求各部门克服本位主义和保守思想，把所有大小仓库和弃置闲散的各种原材料、设备，进行一次彻底清查，并集中起来统一调配，不准私自处理，以保证把这些材料、设备优先用于排灌机械的生产和其它最急需的地方。通知要求各部门、各地区由一个负责干部掌握这一工作，并成立专门组织，使这项工作迅速展开。
