Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: The Academy of Military Science of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was formally established in Beijing on the afternoon of the 15th.

The Academy of Military Science is the planning and guidance organ for military science research and the military academic research organ of the entire Chinese People's Liberation Army. Marshal Ye Jianying, the president and political commissar, said at the inaugural meeting that the Academy of Military Science must take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works as a guide, widely utilize the achievements of modern science and technology, and base itself on the advanced military science and technology achievements of the Soviet Union. Starting from the specific conditions of our country, our army, and various specific situations, we must carry out research work in a planned and step-by-step manner to promote the rapid construction of our army into an excellent, modern, and revolutionary army to defend the security of the motherland and world peace.

	The ideological leap forward of scientists at the Institute of Geophysics has inspired young scientific workers in the institute's seismology group. In the past, they were engaged in the research of electronic instruments, but because they did not get the support of the scientists who led them, they could only work "underground." Now they no longer have to work "underground." The plan originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year can be completed as early as the second quarter, and the amount of work can be increased fourfold. The picture shows them at work.

    地球物理研究所科学家的思想跃进，鼓舞了这个所地震组的青年科学工作者，他们过去进行电子仪器研究工作，由于得不到领导他们的科学家的支持，只能在“地下”干，现在不必再在“地下”干了。原订年底完成的计划可以提早到第二季度完成，还可以增加四倍工作。图为他们正在工作的情况。　本报记者　纳一摄
