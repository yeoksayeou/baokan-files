Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 6th: In the midst of the Great Leap Forward in production, all Anshan Iron and Steel (Anshan) mine workers have raised this year's iron ore production target to over 11 million tons. This target represents an increase of 31.3% compared to last year.

This leap forward plan was formulated by the miners after a struggle against waste and conservatism, and through various efforts to tap potential.

In the Great Leap Forward in production, the miners decided to promote nineteen advanced experiences and new technologies, and to carry out research work on fourteen new technologies. For example, the implementation of the deep-hole sublevel stoping method for Gongchang cold iron ore can ensure safe production and increase labor efficiency by two times. Promoting the comprehensive electric shovel operation experience of the Dagushan open-pit iron mine can also increase work efficiency by more than 20%. The miners are also preparing to organize a group of people to learn advanced experiences from coal mines and non-ferrous metal mines, catch up with the advanced, and strive for a greater leap forward in production.

    让高炉吃得饱产得多
    鞍钢矿工要比去年多采三分之一铁矿石
    新华社鞍山6日电　鞍钢全体矿工在生产大跃进中，已把今年铁矿石的产量指标提高到一千一百万吨以上。这一指标比去年增长31.3％。
    这一跃进计划是矿工们经过反浪费反保守斗争，多方挖掘潜力后制定的。
    在生产大跃进中，矿工们决定推广十九项先进经验和新技术，进行十四项新技术的研究工作。如推行弓长冷铁矿的深孔留矿法，既可确保安全生产，又能提高劳动效率两倍；推行大孤山露天铁矿的电铲综合工作经验，也可提高工作效率20％以上。矿工们还准备组织一批力量，到煤矿和有色金属矿学习先进经验，赶上先进，争取生产的更大跃进。
