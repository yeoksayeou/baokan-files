Xinhua News Agency, 6th March. Yang An, head of the Cambodian economic delegation to China, held a reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the birthday of Cambodian King Norodom Suramarit and the National Day of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extended warm congratulations to His Majesty the King, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, and the Cambodian people at the reception.

He said: In recent years, thanks to the Kingdom of Cambodia's government and Prince Sihanouk's pursuit of a policy of peace and neutrality, the friendly relations between the Kingdom of Cambodia and peace-loving countries around the world have greatly developed. After the founding of the People's Republic of China and the independence of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the two countries' friendly relations have entered a new stage because the two governments have determined to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the unwavering guiding principle for relations between the two countries.

He said: In the past year, mutual visits by cultural delegations and other delegations have enhanced understanding and friendship between the two countries. I am convinced that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia will be increasingly consolidated and developed in the future due to the efforts of the two governments.

Chen Yi proposed a toast to the friendship between China and Cambodia, to the prosperity of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the happiness of its people, to the peace of Asia and the world, and to the health of the King and Queen of Cambodia.

Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Nie Rongzhen, He Xiangning, and Zhang Hanfu attended the reception tonight.

Head of the delegation Yang An delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception to welcome his guests. He wished Chairman Mao Zedong good health, the Chinese people happiness, and the People's Republic of China prosperity. He shouted "Long live the friendship between China and Cambodia, and long live world peace!"

A total of more than 500 people attended the reception, including people from all walks of life in China and foreign envoys to China.
