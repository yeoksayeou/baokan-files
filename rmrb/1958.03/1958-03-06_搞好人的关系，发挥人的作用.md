    Improve Human Relations, Bring into Play the Role of People

    The achievements of this winter's production are unprecedentedly huge. This is greatly related to the rural rectification and commune establishment, especially the transformation of the work style of cadres.

    Before the rural rectification, some cadres, due to their rigid work style, did not achieve the desired results in many things that should have been done well, and even caused dissatisfaction among the masses. As for the masses, because some cadres lacked a democratic work style, their political enthusiasm was dampened, and they dared not say many things that should have been said, and even developed negative emotions, which further affected the unity of cadres and the masses. After the rectification and commune establishment, the work style of cadres has changed, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, thus a new situation has emerged in which matters are discussed together and difficulties are overcome together. In this way, the work is easier to do than in the past, and the enthusiasm of the masses in building socialism is also higher, achieving good results with half the effort.

    To further bring into play the enthusiasm of the masses and promote the continuous upsurge of the production high tide, it is necessary to improve human relations and bring into play the role of people. To this end, all localities should carry out the commune establishment work to the end and better rectify the work style of cadres.

    搞好人的关系，发挥人的作用
    今年冬季生产成绩空前巨大。这和农村整风整社，特别是干部作风的转变有很大关系。
    农村整风以前，有些干部由于作风生硬，许多应该做好的事没有收到应得的好效果，甚至引起群众不满。而群众呢，由于有些干部缺乏民主作风，挫伤了他们的政治积极性，有许多该说的话也不敢说，甚至产生了消极情绪，这又进一步影响到干部和群众的团结。经过整风整社，干部作风转变了，干群关系密切了，从而出现了有事共同商量，有困难共同克服的新的局面。这样，工作比过去好做了，群众建设社会主义的干劲也高了，收到事半功倍的良好效果。
    要进一步发挥群众的积极性，推动生产高潮的不断高涨，就必须搞好人的关系，发挥人的作用。为此，各地应该把整社工作进行到底，更好地整顿干部作风。
