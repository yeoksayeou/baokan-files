    This newspaper reports: The old irrigated areas of Shaanxi Province are vigorously supporting the spring irrigation work of the new irrigated areas.
    Of the more than 1,300 mu of irrigated land in the province this year, 38% are new irrigated areas. These areas lack knowledge and experience in irrigation management. In some areas, the main irrigation projects have been completed, but field water diversion canal systems have not been built; some areas have not yet carried out land leveling and ridge construction; in addition, some areas are unwilling to manage irrigated land due to insufficient labor and animal power.
    Since last winter, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Water Conservancy has transferred farmer water conservancy cadres from state-owned irrigation areas in Guanzhong to form nine technical guidance groups to teach techniques in Danfeng, Shangnan, Baoji, Fengxiang, Qianxian, and other counties. This spring, state-owned irrigation areas transferred cadres and farmers to form twenty technical guidance groups to guide farmers in carrying out spring irrigation work in nineteen counties and cities in the new irrigation areas of Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi. In addition, the Provincial Water Conservancy Cadre School is concentrating on training more than 120 full-time water conservancy cadres and farmer water conservancy technicians from various counties. The management bureaus of Jinghui, Luohui, and Weihui Canals have also held small-scale technical instruction meetings to train more than 640 grassroots leading cadres in charge of water conservancy and water conservancy technical cadres of agricultural cooperatives in various irrigation areas. A large-scale irrigation technology instruction campaign will also be launched throughout the province to train 500,000 farmer water conservancy cadres.
    Currently, spring irrigation is in full swing throughout the province, with more than 2 million mu already irrigated.

    老灌区大力支援新灌区
    陕西将训练五十万农民水利技术干部
    本报讯　陕西省老灌溉区大力支援新灌溉区的春灌工作。
    今年全省一千三百多亩水地中，有38％是新灌溉区。这些地区缺乏灌溉管理的知识和经验。有些地区主要灌溉工程虽已完成，但没有修建田间引水渠系网；有的地区还没有进行平地修畦；另外有些地区因为劳力畜力不足等原因，不愿意经营水地。
    陕西省水利厅从去年冬季就抽调关中各国营灌区的农民水利干部，组成九个技术指导组，分别去丹凤、?南、宝鸡、凤翔、乾县等县进行技术传授。今年春天各国营灌区又抽调干部和农民组成二十个技术指导组，到关中及陕南新灌溉区的十九个县市，指导农民开展春灌工作。此外，省水利干校正在集中训练各县的水利专职干部和农民水利技术员一百二十多人。泾惠、洛惠、渭惠渠的管理局还分别举行小型的技术传授会，训练各灌区基层主管水利的领导干部和农业社的水利技术干部等六百四十多人。在全省范围内还将开展一次大规模的灌溉技术传授运动，训练农民水利干部五十万人。
    目前，全省各地正在紧张进行春灌，现已春浇二百多万亩。
