    Japanese Calligraphy and Seal Carving Exhibition

    The Japanese calligraphy and seal carving exhibition is currently being held at Daoning Zhai in Beihai Park, Beijing, which is a very meaningful cultural exchange. Japanese culture has been deeply influenced by Han culture. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, Japan sent a large number of students to study in China, learning all the rules and systems, as well as music, dance, painting, sculpture, calligraphy, seal carving, etc., all of which were taken from China and followed as models. Since the Japanese writing system has used Chinese characters from its inception, it is inextricably linked to calligraphy and seal carving. China has respected calligraphy and seal carving art since ancient times, and Japan is the same. Japanese calligraphy and seal carving and Chinese culture can be said to be brothers with the same roots, a degree of closeness that is rare.

    From the Han Dynasty, Chinese cultural relics were imported into Japan. Since the Nara period, a large number of Chinese artworks have been shipped to Japan, revered as national treasures. Many of the items preserved in the Shosoin Treasure Repository in Nara are artifacts from the Tang Dynasty. Among them, the famous calligraphy "Mourning Post," which was circulated in Japan, was probably imported during the Sui and Tang dynasties. From that time on, Japanese calligraphy followed the Tang style, respecting the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi and Wang Xianzhi. The sutras were also written in the style of Tang calligraphy. With the rise of female literature in the Heian period, although waka poetry was written in kana, its fluent brushwork still retained the flavor of the Wang school.

    After the Song and Yuan dynasties, Chinese ink paintings and cursive script went to Japan along with Zen Buddhism, and Japanese calligraphy also underwent changes. During the Qing Dynasty, with the rise of epigraphy and archaeology, the inscriptions of the Han, Wei, and Northern Dynasties overshadowed the influence of model books, and this also affected Japan. Seal script and official script became popular. Twenty years ago, when I lived in Tokyo, I visited the Shodo (Calligraphy) Museum of Mr. Fusetsu Nakamura. Among his exhibits, calligraphy and seal carving were all-encompassing. I have a deep love for Shodo, and in the past, when I was in Japan, I often came into contact with their Shodo art. Visiting this exhibition is like seeing old friends again. I particularly like the waka poems written by Shundo Nakamura, Konan Kuwabara, and Shukei Iijima, with their fluent and elegant brushstrokes. The hanging scroll written by Yuho Kudani, "Seeing you off at the door, there are tall bamboos, for you, leaf after leaf, rises a clear breeze," also has the style of Ming Dynasty calligraphy. In terms of seal carving, the seals carved by Toan Kobayashi, "Difficult First, Easy Later," Kyoho Unka's "Snoring Thunder," Toyo Gyosho Matsumaru's "Heaven and Earth are Forever Imperishable," and Shosei Shika's "The Rigid is Easily Broken," are all ancient, simple, and lovely, deeply capturing the legacy of the Han people. Among them, the poem carved by Mr. Soseki Ishii, "The old immortal beckons me to leave the mundane world, flying to the mountains of Jiangnan for ten thousand miles, resting by the clouds on the jadeite rock, climbing the stars under the lotus peaks. The waves of Wu and the peaks of Chu swallow each other, the white tiger and the green sheep come and go. Waking from a dream at the midday window, one can laugh, the pure tour is only in a blink of an eye." The poem is exquisitely crafted, and the seal carving also encompasses various methods. In terms of style, there are many artistic creations of Japan itself, which further enriches the connotation of seal carving art.

    日本书法篆刻展览会
    常任侠
    日本的书法篆刻，正在北京北海公园的道宁斋展出，这是极有意义的文化交流工作。日本受汉文化的浸染极深，在隋唐时代，派遣了大批的留学生，来我国学习，把一切典章制度，都传习而去，他如音乐、舞蹈、绘画、雕塑、书法、篆刻等等，也都取法我国，遵为典范。由于日本的文字，自其开始就使用的是我国文字，与书法篆刻，有分不开的关系。我国自古尊重书法篆刻艺术，日本也相同。日本的书法篆刻与中国文化，可以说是同气连枝的兄弟关系，这种亲密的程度，是很少有的现象。
    日本从汉代，就有中国的文物输入，到奈良时代以来，我国的艺术品，大量舶载以去，日本尊为国宝，至今保存于奈良正仓院内的，有不少是唐代的遗物。其中流传于日本的著名墨宝“丧乱帖”，大概也是在隋唐时代输入。从那时开始，日本的书法，按照唐人的风气，尊重二王，写经也以唐人书法为范。平安朝女性文学兴起，写和歌虽则使用假名，但其流利的笔姿，仍是王帖的韵味。
    到宋元以后，中国水墨画和行草，随禅宗以俱往，日本书法也起了变化。到清代的金石考古学兴起，汉魏北朝碑刻，有压倒丛帖之势，这个影响也波及到日本。篆隶风行。在二十年前我住东京时，尝到中村不折翁的书道博物馆中纵览，在他的展览品中，书法篆刻，就是兼收并蓄的。我对于书道，有很深的嗜好，过去在日本时，他们的书道艺术，我常有接触，这次参观展览，真如同重见故人一样。我特别欢喜中村春堂，桑原江南，饭岛春敬等人所写的和歌，笔致流利秀韵。管谷幽峰所书“相送当门有修竹，为君叶叶起清风”的立轴，也颇有明代人书艺的风致。在篆刻方面，小林斗庵所刻的“先难后易”峰云香京所刻的“鼾雷”，松丸东鱼所刻的“天地长不灭”，生井子华所刻的“刚易折”，都古质可爱，深得汉人遗意。其中石井双石翁所刻的一首诗，“老仙招我出尘寰，飞上江南万里山，翡翠岩头拨云卧，芙蓉峰下蹑星攀。吴波楚岫互吞吐，白虎青羊相往还。梦觉午窗堪一笑，清游只在瞬时间。”诗既精工，篆刻亦包罗众法，在风格上有不少是日本自己创造的艺术，更加丰富了篆刻艺术的内涵。
