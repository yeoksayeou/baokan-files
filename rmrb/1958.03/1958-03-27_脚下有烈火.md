    Flames Underfoot
    The Adenauer government of West Germany, manipulating the West German Federal Assembly, passed a resolution to arm the West German army with atomic weapons. This resolution, considered a "victory" for the Adenauer government, even had the Associated Press, which is always enthusiastic about advocating West German expansion and armament, worrying that it "will inevitably cause more trouble."
    However, the Associated Press's worry still understated the situation. Because, during the debate in the West German Federal Assembly, the two opposition parties already pointed out that this resolution would cause not just "more trouble," but a "national crisis."
    The Adenauer government only cares about siding with the Atlantic policy, but it has not noticed that a raging fire against "atomic death" has ignited under its feet. Of course, this approach of the Adenauer government will gain the appreciation and praise of the United States, but the flames ignited under its feet will burn so fiercely that it will be unable to stand.

    脚下有烈火
    西德的阿登纳政府操纵西德的联邦议院通过了一项以原子武器武装西德军队的决议。被认为是阿登纳政府的“胜利”的这个决议，连一向热心于鼓吹西德扩军备战的美联社也不得不担心“必然会引起更多的麻烦”。
    但是，美联社的担心还是把情况过分轻描淡写了。因为，就在西德联邦议院的辩论中，两个反对党已经指出这个决议将引起的不仅是什么“更多的麻烦”，而将是“全国性危机”。
    阿登纳政府只顾投靠大西洋政策，但是没有顾到在它的脚下已燃起了反对“原子死亡”的熊熊烈火。固然，阿登纳政府的这种做法会得到美国的赏识和赞扬，可是，在它脚下所燃起的这股烈火，却会烧得使它站不住脚的。
