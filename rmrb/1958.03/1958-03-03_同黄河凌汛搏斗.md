　　Fighting the Yellow River Ice Floes
　　A certain unit of the Railway Corps, which is building the Sandaokan Yellow River Grand Iron Bridge on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, is preparing to fight the upcoming Yellow River ice floe season. Construction soldiers have placed more than 1,000 cubic meters of rubble and sandbags around each pier to prevent ice floe impact. The demolition unit has already blasted open all the ice layers in the narrow throat area above the bridge. Currently, defenses are being set up along the river, preparing to blast large ice floes when they flow downstream to ensure the safety of the bridge project. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
