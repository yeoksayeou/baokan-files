    Editor's Notes
    Three thousand young people from industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai are determined to spur forward towards the socialist leap forward, and have proposed launching a "four comparisons" campaign among young people in industrial and commercial circles throughout the city to accelerate self-transformation. This is an initiative that benefits the industrial and commercial sectors themselves and benefits socialism. We warmly welcome this advanced initiative.
    The struggle between socialism and capitalism, no matter how long it takes or how tortuous the road, will always end with socialism defeating capitalism. This is true of the Soviet Union, true of China, and will certainly be true of all countries in the world. This is the law of historical development of human society, and it cannot be resisted. We hope that all friends in the industrial and commercial sectors who are willing to take the socialist road, whether young or old, will respond to the initiative of the young people in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles.

    值得欢迎的倡议
    上海三千名工商界青年决心快马加鞭向社会主义跃进，倡议在全市工商界青年中开展“四比”活动，加速自我改造。这是一个有利于工商界自己，有利于社会主义的倡议。我们十分欢迎这个先进倡议。
    社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争，不管时间多么长，道路多么曲折，但结局总是社会主义战胜资本主义。苏联如此，中国如此，世界各国也必将如此。这是人类社会历史发展的规律，是抗拒不了的。愿一切愿意走社会主义道路的工商界朋友，不管是年青的还是年老的，都来响应上海工商界青年的倡议。
