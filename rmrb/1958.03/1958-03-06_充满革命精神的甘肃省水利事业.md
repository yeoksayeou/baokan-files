The Water Conservancy Undertaking of Gansu Province, Full of Revolutionary Spirit
By our correspondent Gu Lei

(V) Mobilizing the Masses, Relying on the Masses

Relying on the masses to develop water conservancy has always been a clear and unwavering policy of Gansu Province.

When Gansu Province was vigorously developing water conservancy and comprehensively transforming nature, it was also a time when the country was vigorously carrying out industrial construction. The state could not invest heavily in this undertaking in Gansu. In addition, although agricultural production in Gansu Province had developed after liberation, the lives of farmers could not be said to be "very prosperous." Coupled with the sparse population and large area to be governed, there were many difficulties. At this time, the Gansu Party organization did not complain, did not look to the state, and did not slow down the pace of work, but turned to the masses. This concept was very clear. The Provincial Party Committee repeatedly instructed Party organizations at all levels to trust the masses, rely on the masses, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Only in this way could water conservancy be realized quickly.

In implementing the mass line, Gansu Province has grasped the following three tasks:

First, strengthen the socialist ideological education of the masses. This is of particular importance in Gansu. Due to long-term drought in history, some backward consciousness has been left in the minds of the masses. In the great drought of 1953, the Party called on everyone to build irrigated land, but many farmers did not listen. Instead, they burned incense and kowtowed to pray for rain. Farmers in Yuanjiagou, Tongwei County, Dingxi Prefecture, dug a well that was 28 feet deep, and the water rose 18 feet overnight. This was originally a good phenomenon, but the farmers thought it was a "sea eye" and dared not use it, so they filled it in. Farmers in many places simply did not believe that drought could be overcome. This fear of nature is incompatible with the idea that "man can conquer nature." Only by sweeping away the feudal superstition in the minds of the masses and letting the masses realize their own strength can the water conservancy undertaking move forward in great strides. To this end, various places have adopted various comparison methods to educate farmers: (1) Compare the numbers of water resources and existing irrigated land to show that there is great potential and broad prospects for developing paddy fields; (2) Cultivate typical examples and mobilize farmers from the economic effects by comparing irrigated and dry land; (3) Carry out comprehensive income comparisons between villages with and without water conservancy, and conduct collective education; (4) Compare advanced areas with backward areas, organize farmers in backward areas to visit advanced areas, and ask people from advanced areas to introduce their experiences, using personal experiences to educate everyone; (5) Mobilize farmers to talk about the suffering of their past lives, dig up bitter roots, and compare them with their current lives, explaining that only by overcoming drought can they forever dig out the bitter roots; (6) Compare the current situation with the long-term water conservancy plan, pointing out that building water conservancy is the road to a more prosperous life, and use the happy future to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses; (7) Compare the political, economic, and cultural life of farmers before and after they turned over, explaining that as long as there is the leadership of the Communist Party, people will definitely be able to conquer nature, and water conservancy will definitely be realized; (8) Compare the water conservancy construction before and after the cooperativization, explaining that after the farmers are organized, they have the power to vigorously develop water conservancy. Through these comparison educations, the vast number of farmers have gained confidence in transforming nature. There are many examples in this regard that can educate everyone. Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan County was originally a drought-stricken area of "dry mountains where sheepskins do not stick to grass, and nine out of ten crops are not harvested." Before liberation, the yield per mu was 70 to 80 jin. As a result of building water conservancy, conserving water and soil, and afforestation, the yield per mu reached 231 jin in 1956. Using millions of similar facts to educate, farmers have seen the happy life of the future and are willing to engage in hard labor.

Another important content of implementing the mass line is to fully believe in the strength of the masses, support any initiative of the masses, and commend and promote the various creations and experiences of the masses. When the masses are ideologically clear and act, their power is immeasurable. What was considered impossible in the past has now become a reality. It used to be said that water could not go up the mountain, but now it has gone up the mountain! In the past, it was said that there was a shortage of building materials, but the masses created many experiences in building dams, weirs, ponds, and drop structures with stones! In the past, it was said that the water level was deep and it was difficult to dig wells, but the masses created many methods of digging deep wells and artesian wells! In the past, it was said that there were not enough water lifting tools, but the masses created a variety of waterwheels. In short, farmers have made thousands of creations! The masses in Dongliangshan created the experience of irrigating on steep mountain slopes, comprehensively solving the irrigation problem in mountainous areas. The experience of digging artesian wells can solve the water use problem in many places in the province, and the method is simple, fast, and can also save a lot of water lifting tools and well construction costs. According to the calculation of Zhangye Prefecture, digging an artesian well 30 to 50 meters deep requires an average of only 122 man-days and 329 yuan of funds, which can irrigate 50 mu of land, averaging more than 6 yuan per mu, and the increased income in one year is equal to twice the investment. Countless facts in the province have proved that no matter what kind of project, as long as the masses come up with ideas and do it themselves, it is always fast, good, and economical. The Yellow River bank protection and siltation project undertaken by the masses in Dongtan Township, Yuzhong County, includes a 360-meter-long stone dam, a 100-meter-long canal and a culvert. Engineers estimated that it would require an investment of 1.1 million yuan, but the masses completed it with 5,000 yuan and 20,000 workdays. The masses in Zhangye area created 880 kilometers of pebble-lined dikes with an investment of only 3.4 million yuan. If cement were used, it would cost 51.6 million yuan. In other aspects such as canals, dams, ponds, dikes, cellars, wells, tree planting, and grass planting, the masses have also made creations. The Gansu Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to these creations and vigorously promotes them.

Another important issue is to rationally solve the burden of building water conservancy. This is the fundamental way to consolidate and develop the enthusiasm of the masses economically. Construction requires money, and enthusiasm alone cannot last. Therefore, in addition to distributing most of the main income of the year to the masses, the labor days used for building water conservancy are handled according to the principle of more benefit, more burden, less benefit, less burden, and no benefit, no burden. Generally, it is distributed in the same year, giving the same remuneration as agricultural labor days. When supporting other cooperatives in building water conservancy, cooperatives that do not benefit can exchange labor, or the benefiting cooperatives can give a certain remuneration, or a certain amount of income can be taken out of the income and distributed to cooperatives that have labor but do not benefit. When calculating benefits, indirect benefits (such as upstream ditch management that eliminates the threat of floods downstream) are also included, and a certain number of labor days are paid. For projects jointly built by several cooperatives, the corresponding labor days are paid according to the amount of benefit each cooperative receives. In some areas, in order to encourage people to build water conservancy, appropriate methods are adopted to increase labor points (slightly higher than the labor points for participating in agricultural labor), and some divide the labor force participating in water conservancy construction into several grades and give different remuneration. The attention paid to this issue in various places has reduced the masses' concerns about suffering losses and further consolidated the enthusiasm of the masses for building water conservancy.

(VI) New Situation, New Plan

In 1958, Gansu Province launched a new upsurge in water conservancy construction on the basis of past water conservancy work. According to the plans reported by various places, 13.3 million mu of new irrigated land will be built in 1958, and mainly in mountainous areas. This figure is equal to 3.5 times the first peak in 1956, nearly twice the figure for irrigated land built in the two thousand years before liberation, 14 times the actual completion in 1957, and nearly four times the original plan for 1958. What is even more valuable is that since the Dongliang Canal in Wushan drew water up the mountain, and since various places learned from the practice of the Dongliang Canal, a brand new situation has emerged in the water conservancy undertaking in Gansu. This situation has the following characteristics:

First, in the past, irrigated land and watered land were mostly in the Sichuan Basin, but now water conservancy has moved from the plain to the mountain and the plateau. In the two prefectures of Tianshui and Pingliang alone, 54 canals for drawing water up the mountain have been started, which can irrigate 3.32 million mu of land. Calculated at an increase of 200 jin of grain per mu, it can increase production by 660 million jin. Water going up the mountain has formed a movement throughout the province, changing the habit of water not being able to go up the mountain for thousands of years. This is the starting point for realizing water conservancy in mountainous areas ahead of schedule, creating sufficient conditions for developing mountainous areas. This is not only a great victory in the water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province, but also a signal for water conservancy in mountainous areas across the country.

Second, after water goes up the mountain, it further proves that "man can conquer nature," basically eliminating various conservative and backward ideas, and greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the masses for building water conservancy. They have raised funds and developed large-scale canals. According to the plans reported by various places, the funds raised by the masses in 1958 may reach 110 million yuan, averaging more than 9 yuan per person according to the population of the province. At present, many large-scale canal projects are funded by the masses. The Beiliang Canal in Wushan is 300 li long and flows through 15 townships in Ganggu and Wushan counties, irrigating more than 200,000 mu of land. This canal has to cross 41 mountain streams of 30 to 100 meters, 59 small ditches of less than 30 meters, and build 12 tunnels of 10 to 60 meters. The masses have done this arduous project themselves. This fully proves that the masses can not only build medium and small-scale projects, but also build large-scale projects, thereby raising the technology of water conservancy construction to a new level and raising the principle of relying on the masses to develop water conservancy to a new stage.

Third, after water goes up the mountain, many things that were unimaginable in the past will become a reality, establishing a vigorous, bold, and revolutionary spirit. The Tao River canal project, which the Water Conservancy Bureau recently sent people to assist Dingxi Prefecture in surveying and preparing to start construction in July, is a brilliant example. The Tao River starts from Liuerlin in Huichuan County, with a water level of 2,250 meters, an annual runoff of 4.5 billion cubic meters, and an average flow of 150 cubic meters per second. This canal will run on the mountains at an elevation of 2,000 meters, with a length of 1,000 kilometers, almost equal to the length of the Grand Canal. It will irrigate more than 7 million mu of land in 21 counties (cities) including Huichuan, Lintao, Weiyuan, and Dingxi, making the arid areas in central Gansu fully water conservancy. This canal will also be largely completed by relying on the financial resources, materials, and manpower of the benefiting counties.

Fourth, after water goes up the mountain, the production enthusiasm of farmers has been increased. According to incomplete statistics, farmers in various places need 10,185 waterwheels and a large number of chemical fertilizers, new-style farm tools, etc. These things are currently in short supply, which indicates that a new production upsurge has arrived.

Fifth, after water goes up the mountain, the people's confidence in building mountainous areas has been increased. With water going up the mountain, there are "drop structures" everywhere, suitable for building small hydropower stations, and farmers immediately raised this demand. Now, various places have requested the state to supply 1,200 small power generation equipments. According to incomplete statistics from Tianshui, Zhangye, Pingliang and other prefectures alone, the masses have requested the construction of 805 power stations, which is a signal for the prosperity of mountainous areas. Precisely because water is going up the mountain, it is suitable for building small hydropower stations everywhere, which means that the electrification of mountainous areas will be realized earlier than in plain areas, which was also unexpected in the past.

Sixth, after water goes up the mountain, farmers need various materials. According to incomplete statistics from the province, they need 220 tons of steel bars, 12,351 tons of cement, 400 tons of steel plates, 100 tons of seamless steel pipes, 16,157 tons of steel, and 800 tons of steel rails, plus waterwheels, generators, chemical fertilizers, and other agricultural machinery. This is a new assault on certain industrial products, which has expanded the market for industrial products and will vigorously promote the development of related industries.

Seventh, after water goes up the mountain, various water sources have been fully utilized. As a result, there are contradictions in water use between upstream and downstream, between counties, and between townships, which urgently requires the leadership to carry out basin planning and comprehensively arrange water use issues, and also requires connecting certain rivers and comprehensively utilizing them. This will prompt the leadership to raise the planning work to a new level to adapt to this situation. And after the level of planning work is improved, it will in turn promote the water conservancy undertaking to move forward more rapidly.

Now, Gansu Province is arranging various tasks according to this new situation, and on this basis, it has proposed to realize water conservancy in three years, terrace all mountainous areas in ten years, completely control the hills and gullies, permanently eliminate the harm of soil erosion, and green barren mountains and bald ridges through tree planting and grass planting, so that the grain yield per mu will exceed 400 jin in six years.

The entire process of Gansu Province vigorously developing water conservancy and changing the natural landscape proves several fundamental experiences: The water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province can only be successfully completed and prosper under the leadership of the Communist Party, in order to sweep away the desolate scenes of thousands of years; the water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province can only appear two climaxes in three years after the realization of cooperativization; the water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province has developed in the continuous struggle against right-leaning conservatism, which is actually a struggle between two roads, and also an ideological revolution. Only by winning in this area can the water conservancy undertaking be full of vitality; the water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province is advancing under the guidance of the principle of fully relying on the strength of the masses. Without the active actions of millions of people, there would be no water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province, which is the fundamental guarantee for realizing water conservancy; the water conservancy undertaking in Gansu Province is the result of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee leading the people of the province to work hard with revolutionary vigor under extremely difficult conditions. If all parts of the country can vigorously develop water conservancy with the spirit of Gansu, then the national water conservancy will surely arrive soon. (To be continued)

    充满革命精神的甘肃省水利事业
    本报记者　顾雷
    （五）发动群众　依靠群众
    依靠群众办水利事业，一直是甘肃省明确的、坚定不移的方针。
    甘肃省大兴水利，并结合进行对大自然全面改造的时候，也正是国家大力进行工业建设的时候，国家无法对甘肃的这一事业大量投资。另外，甘肃农业生产在解放后虽然有发展，农民的生活还不能说“很富裕”，加上人口稀少，治理面积大，于是困难重重。这时，甘肃党组织没有叫苦，没有把眼睛望着国家，也没有放慢工作的脚步，而是面向群众。这个观念是很明确的。省委一再指示各级党的组织，要相信群众、依靠群众、发挥群众的积极性和创造性，只有这样才能很快实现水利化。
    在贯彻执行群众路线方面，甘肃省抓住了下列三个工作：
    首先是加强群众社会主义思想教育。这在甘肃具有特别重要的意义。由于历史上长期干旱，在群众心理上留下了某些落后的意识，1953年大旱，党号召大家修水地，有许多农民不听，反而烧香磕头求雨。定西专区通渭县袁家沟农民打了一眼井深二丈八尺，一夜间水涨了一丈八尺，这本来是好现象，农民却认为是“海眼”，不敢用，填上了。有不少地方的农民根本不相信干旱可以被战胜。这种对自然的畏惧心理，是和“人定能胜天”的思想不相容的。只有扫净群众思想上的封建迷信观念，让群众认识自己的力量，水利事业才能大步前进。为此，各地采取了多种对比的办法教育农民：（1）调查水力资源和当前已有水地的数字对比，说明潜力很大，发展水田有广阔的前途；（2）培养典型，用水旱田对比，从经济效果上发动农民；（3）水利化的乡和没有水利化的乡进行全面收益对比，进行集体教育；（4）先进地区和落后地区对比，组织落后地区的农民到先进地区参观，请先进地区的人介绍经验，用亲身经历教育大家；（5）发动农民诉说过去生活痛苦，挖苦根和现在的生活对比，说明只有战胜干旱，才能永远把苦根挖掉；（6）当前的状况和水利的远景规划对比，指出兴修水利是走向更富裕的道路，用幸福的未来鼓舞群众的热情；（7）农民翻身前后政治、经济、文化生活状况对比，说明只要有了共产党的领导，人一定可以胜天，水利化一定能实现；（8）合作化前后兴修水利状况的对比，说明农民组织起来以后，有大兴水利的力量。通过这些对比教育，使广大农民有了改造自然的信心。属于这方面可以教育大家的例子是很多的。皋兰县庄子坪农业社，原是“拉羊皮不粘草的干山，十种九不收的庄田”的干旱地区。解放前，每亩产量七八十斤。由于兴修水利、保持水土、绿化的结果，到1956年亩产量达到二百三十一斤。用千百万个类似的事实进行教育，使农民看到了未来幸福的生活，愿意从事艰苦的劳动。
    贯彻群众路线的另一个重要内容是充分相信群众的力量，支持群众任何一点积极性，表扬和推广群众的各种创造和经验。群众思想通了，行动起来了，力量是不可估计的。过去认为不可能的事情，目前都变成现实了。过去说水上不了山，现在上山了！过去说缺少建筑材料，群众创造了许多用石头砌坝、堰、塘、跌水的经验！过去说水位深，打井难，群众创造了许多打深井，自流井的方法！过去说提水工具不够，群众创造了多种多样的水车。总之，农民有了成千上万种的创造！东梁山群众，创造了在坡度很大的山地上进行浇灌的经验，全面地解决了山区的灌溉问题。打自流井的经验，可使全省很多地方解决用水问题，而且打法简单，速度快，还可以节省大量的提水工具和建井的费用。根据张掖专区的计算，打一眼深三十到五十公尺的自流井，平均只需人工一百二十二个，资金三百二十九元，可浇灌五十亩地，每亩平均六元多，一年增产的收入即等于投资的两倍。全省已有无数事实证明，不管是什么样的工程，只要是群众出主意、动手干，总是又快、又好、又省。榆中县东滩乡群众兴办的黄河护岸防冲淤地工程，其中有三百六十公尺长的石坝一条，一百多公尺长的渠道及涵洞一个，据工程师估计需投资一百一十万元，但群众用五千元、二万个工日就修成了。张掖地区的群众，创造用卵石衬砌水堤八百八十公里只投资三百四十万元，如用洋灰则需要五千一百六十万元。其他如渠、坝、塘、堤、窖、井、植树、种草等，群众都有创造。甘肃省委非常重视这些创造，并且大力推广这方面的创造。
    再一个重要问题是，合理的解决兴修水利的负担问题。这是从经济上巩固和发扬群众积极性的根本办法。建设需要钱，光靠热情是不能持久的。因此，各地除了把当年主要的收益大部分分配给群众外，对于兴修水利所用的劳动日，按照多受益多负担、少受益少负担、不受益不负担的原则加以处理。一般的是当年分配，分给同农业劳动日一样的报酬。在支援外社修水利时，本社没有受益的可以变工还工，或由受益的社给予一定报酬，或在收益中拿出一定数量的收入分配给有劳动没有受益的社。计算受益的时候，对于间接受益的（如上游治沟而下游免去了洪水威胁的）也计算进去，付出一定的劳动日。几个社联合兴修的工程，根据各社受益的多少，付出相应的劳动日。还有的地区，为了鼓励修水利的人，采取适当提高劳动工分，（比参加农业劳动的工分稍高些）的做法，还有的把参加修水利的劳动力分为几等，给予不同的报酬。各地对于这个问题的注意，减少了群众怕吃亏的顾虑，进一步巩固了群众兴修水利的热情。
  （六）新的形势　新的计划
    1958年，甘肃省在过去水利工作的基础上，又掀起一个新的兴修水利高潮。根据各地报来的计划，1958年将新修水地一千三百三十万亩，而且主要是在山区。这个数字等于1956年第一个高峰的三倍半，等于解放前两千年修水地数字的近两倍，等于1957年实际完成数的十四倍，等于1958年原计划的近四倍。更可贵的是，自从武山东梁渠引水上山以后，自从各地学习东梁渠的做法以后，甘肃水利事业出现了一个崭新的形势。这个形势有以下几个特点：
    第一，过去水地和水浇地大都在川里，而现在水利由平川走上山，走上塬了。只是天水、平凉两个专区，动工修建的引水上山的渠道即达五十四条，可浇地三百三十二万亩，以每亩增产二百斤粮计，即可增产六点六亿斤。水上山，在全省形成了运动，改变了几千年来水不能上山的习惯，这是提前实现山区水利化的起点，给开发山区创造了充分的条件。这不仅是甘肃省水利事业上的大胜利，而且是全国山区水利化的信号。
    第二，水上山后，更证明了“人定能胜天”，基本上肃清了各种保守落后思想，大大提高了群众兴修水利的热情，纷纷集资，纷纷开发大型渠道。各地报来的计划1958年群众集资可能达到一亿一千万元，按全省人口平均每人约九元多。目前，有许多大型渠道工程，都是由群众集资兴办的。武山北梁渠，长三百华里，流经甘谷、武山县十五个乡镇，灌溉二十多万亩土地。这条渠要越过三十——一百公尺的山涧四十一条，三十公尺以下的小沟五十九条，要修十——六十公尺的隧洞十二个。这种艰巨的工程，群众都动手干了。这充分证明，群众不仅可以修中、小型工程，而且可以修大型工程，从而把兴修水利的技术提到了新的水平，把依靠群众办水利事业的方针提到新的阶段。
    第三，水上山以后，使许多过去不敢想像的事情将变成现实，树立了旺盛的大胆的革命精神。最近由水利局派人协助定西专区勘察，准备7月份动工的洮河渠道工程即是个辉煌的例证。洮河从会川县柳儿林起，水位拔高二千二百五十公尺，年径流量四十五亿公方，平均流量一百五十秒公方。这条渠将走在拔海二千公尺的山上，长一千公里，几乎等于运河的长度。它将灌溉会川、临洮、渭源、定西等二十一个县（市）七百余万亩土地，使甘肃中部干旱地区全部水利化。这条渠，也将大部依靠受益县群众的财力、物力、人力完成。
    第四，水上山后，提高了农民的生产热情。据不完整的统计，各地农民需要水车一万零一百八十五个以及大量的化学肥料，新式农具等。这些东西目前已供不应求，这预示着一个新的生产高潮已经到来。
    第五，水上山后，提高了人民建设山区的信心。水上山了，到处都有“跌水”，适于建立小型水力发电站，农民马上提出了这方面的要求。现在，各地提出了要求国家供应一千二百台小型发电设备。仅据天水、张掖、平凉等专区不完全的统计，群众要求建设发电站八百零五个，这是繁荣山区的信号。正由于水上山以后，到处适于建立小型水力发电站，就预示着山区的电气化会早于平川地区实现，这也是过去没有预料到的事。
    第六，水上山后，农民需要各种材料。据全省不完全统计，需要钢筋二百二十吨，水泥一万二千三百五十一吨，钢板四百吨，无缝钢管一百吨，钢一万六千一百五十七吨，钢轨八百吨，加以水车、发电机、化学肥料及其他农业机械等。这是对某些工业产品新的突击，为工业产品扩大了市场，会有力的促进有关工业的发展。
    第七，水上山后，各种水源都被充分利用了。于是出现了上游与下游、县与县、乡与乡之间用水的矛盾，迫切要求领导上进行流域规划，全面安排用水问题，而且需要使某些河连接起来，综合加以利用。这会促使领导上，把规划工作提到新的高度，以适应这一形势。而提高了规划工作的水平以后，反过来又会促进水利事业更迅速地前进。
    现在，甘肃省正根据这一新的形势安排各项工作，并且在这个基础上提出了三年实现水利化，十年使所有山区梯田化，完全控制住山岭沟壑，永除水土流失之害，通过植树、种草，绿化荒山秃岭，六年内使每亩粮食产量超过四百斤。
    甘肃省大兴水利，改变自然面貌的全部过程，证明了几条根本性的经验：甘肃的水利事业，只有在共产党的领导下，才能胜利完成，才能一扫几千年萧条的景象，繁荣起来；甘肃省的水利事业，只有在实现了合作化以后，才可能在三年内出现两个高潮；甘肃省的水利事业，是在不断反右倾保守的斗争中发展起来的，这实际上是一场两条道路的斗争，也是思想上的革命，取得这方面的胜利才使水利事业充满了生命力；甘肃省的水利事业，是在充分依靠群众力量的方针指导下前进的，没有千百万人的积极行动就没有甘肃省的水利事业，这是实现水利化的根本保证；甘肃省的水利事业，是甘肃省委领导全省人民，在极困难的条件下，充满革命朝气、艰苦奋斗的结果。如果全国各地都能用甘肃的这种精神大兴水利，那么全国的水利化必然会早日到来。　（续完）（附图片）
