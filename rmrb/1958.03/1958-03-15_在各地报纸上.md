In Various Newspapers

    Catch Up Quickly
    The March 7th Southern Daily’s report on afforestation was very rich in content. On the first page, there was a news item reporting that the person in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee told the newspaper’s reporter that the comparative table of afforestation progress in the twelve southern provinces published in the People's Daily on March 1st was a spur to Guangdong, and afforestation work must catch up quickly. This news item provided a comprehensive report on the afforestation situation in various special districts. The decision of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee on popularizing the advanced afforestation experience of Chaoyang Jinxing Cooperative, etc., is even more noteworthy, with a large-character headline: "Learn from the Advanced, Accelerate the Greening of the Whole Province."
    
    Two-Oxen Plowing Disappears
    The popularization of new-style plows in Dunhuang, the disappearance of two-oxen plowing, and striving to achieve mechanization throughout the county within three years, this is the headline news in the Gansu Daily on March 11th. Each new-style plow can cultivate more than 70 mu of land per year. Dunhuang County already has 4,000 units, averaging one unit for every 54 mu of land.

    Good News from Jiangxi
    On March 11th, the Jiangxi Daily prominently reported on the recently concluded Provincial Congress of Socialist Agricultural Activists with two pages. The first page not only published large photographs, allowing many activist representatives to meet the readers; but also expressed the representatives' determination "to do everything possible to achieve a great leap forward in production" through news, editorials, and solemn proposals. On the third page, a special page for heroic deeds, it introduced many miracles such as Yang Changying's creation of wooden levels, Han Zhizhong's splitting mountains to divert water through "three passes," and Yao Guohua's turning barren mountains into oil depots.

    It's Not That We Can't, It's That We Didn't
    The Harbin Municipal Party Committee decided to change the original Wednesday, which was designated as a meeting-free day for municipal organs, to Monday and Tuesday as meeting days, with the remaining days being meeting-free days. This approach has worked very well. On March 11th, the Heilongjiang Daily published a report by reporters Li Dexi and Cao Deng on this new leadership method. Whether this major innovation in leadership methods is practically feasible in decision-making organs like the Municipal Party Committee has been proven by a month-long trial to be something that couldn't be done in the past, not because we couldn't do it, but because we didn't. Now, this approach has reduced meetings, and the work is still done very well. On meeting-free days, leading comrades go from the office to the grassroots level and become members of the masses. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Lin Youxia,拜拜 (bài bài: pay respect to, or apprentice oneself to someone) the famous labor model Su Guangming as his teacher, and the Mayor, Lü Qien, is at the fertilizer plant. When they are working with the workers, the reporters said that no one recognizes these as leading comrades.

    在各地报纸上
    急起直追
    7日南方日报的造林报道内容很丰富。一版上有条消息报道，广东省委负责人对报纸的记者说，3月1日人民日报登出的南方十二省造林进度比较表，对广东是一个鞭策，造林工作必须急起直追。这条消息对各专区的造林情况作了综合报道。中共广东省委和广东省人民委员会关于推广潮阳金星社等先进造林经验的决定，更是引人注意，它的大字标题是：“学习先进，加速绿化全省”。
    二牛抬杠绝迹
    敦煌新式步犁普及，二牛抬杠绝迹，争取三年内全县实现机械化，这是甘肃日报3月11日的头条消息，新式步犁每部一年可耕七十多亩地，敦煌县已有四千部，平均每五十四亩地就有一部。
    江西传来的喜讯
    11日江西日报，以两个版面突出地报道了刚刚胜利闭幕的全省社会主义农业积极分子代表大会。一版上不但刊出了大幅照片，使许多积极分子代表同读者见了面；并从新闻、社论和庄严的倡议书中表达了代表们“要千方百计实现生产大跃进”的决心。在三版的英雄事迹专页上，介绍了杨长瀛创造木质水准仪、韩志仲劈山引水过“三关”、姚国华使荒山变油库等许多奇迹。
    是不为也　非不能也
    哈尔滨市委决定把市属机关原定星期三为无会议日，现改为星期一、二为会议日，其余几天都为无会议日。这样作效果很好。11日黑龙江日报发表了记者李德希、曹登关于这种新的领导方法报道。这种领导方法上的大革新，在像市委这样的决策机关是否切实可行，经过一个月试验证明过去作不到，是不为也，非不能也。现在这样作减少了会议，工作还办得很好。在无会议日，领导同志都从办公室去到基层，成为群众中的一员，市委书记林有硖拜著名的劳动模范苏广铭为老师，市长吕其恩在化肥厂，当他们在同工人一起劳动的时候，记者说谁也认不出这些就是领导同志。
