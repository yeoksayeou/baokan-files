    The Voice of the Soviet People
    ——Notes from Attending the Soviet Supreme Soviet Session
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang

    One of the important items on the agenda of the first session of the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was the discussion on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing the Machine and Tractor Stations (MTS). After Khrushchev delivered his report to the assembly on this issue on the evening of March 27th, the discussion began at the meeting on March 28th. One representative after another stepped onto the podium to convey to the assembly the unanimous support of the people across the country for the resolutions of the February Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee.

    The representatives unanimously pointed out that the reorganization of the MTS has not only great practical significance but also profound theoretical value. The Belarusian representative, Avkhimovich, said that the decision to reorganize the tractor stations was the most significant revolutionary measure since the overall collectivization of agriculture. Many representatives said that this major reform was based on reality, reflected the demands of the people, and demonstrated the close connection between the Soviet Communist Party and the people in making policy decisions. Only dogmatists and conservatives could fail to understand the positive significance of this reform.

    It was also evident from the representatives' speeches that the entire Soviet people, whether in cities or villages, expressed their heartfelt support for this decision of the CPSU. The Ukrainian representative, Karchenko, said that the collective farms in Ukraine were fully capable and powerful enough to purchase machinery. To specifically illustrate this point, he cited several figures: In 1952, the cash income of all collective farms in Ukraine was 10 billion rubles, which had increased to 25 billion rubles by 1957 (of which 4.6 billion rubles were allocated to the collective farms' public accumulation funds). What is the total value of the machinery in the existing tractor stations in Ukraine? Five billion rubles. This means that if the collective farms' public accumulation funds last year were increased by just 400 million rubles, they could buy all the machinery of the tractor stations. Currently, 2,000 collective farms in Ukraine have guaranteed that they can pay off the purchase price of the machinery this year, and most other farms can pay off the cost within two years.

    During the discussion, the representatives also raised many questions and suggestions, such as what problems would arise after the reorganization of the tractor stations and how these problems should be solved. The representatives suggested in their speeches that it was necessary to first strengthen ideological leadership and technical assistance to the collective farms. The Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation, B.G. Tikhtov, believed that the District Soviets should regularly convene technical conferences to understand the difficulties below and provide timely assistance. Regarding the supply of spare parts and gasoline for agricultural machinery, some believed that it should be the responsibility of the technical repair stations, while others believed that the rural supply and marketing cooperatives could supply them. However, the unanimous opinion was that these tasks should be centralized in one place to avoid wasting manpower. Poliansky, a representative from Kuban, also raised the issues of revising the model regulations for agricultural cooperatives and establishing a trade union for agricultural workers. Due to the growth of public accumulation funds in recent years, the provision in the model regulations for agricultural cooperatives stipulating that public accumulation funds should not exceed 20% of the collective farm's cash income is outdated. In addition, since most agricultural workers have transferred to the collective farms, he believes it is necessary to establish a trade union for agricultural workers to take care of their welfare.

    At the meeting, the representatives also criticized, based on their own experiences, the erroneous view that selling machinery to the collective farms would weaken the ownership by the whole people. The representatives said that after the collective farms buy the machinery, they will further expand their production and deliver more grain to the state. At the same time, due to the growth of public accumulation funds, they will also build more power stations and schools, and construct more roads and houses. All of this will undoubtedly lead socialist agriculture to new prosperity and lay the foundation for the transition to communism.

    苏联人民的心声
    ——苏联最高苏维埃会议旁听记
    本报记者　崔永昌
    苏联第五届最高苏维埃第一次会议的重要议程之一，就是讨论进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的问题。3月27日晚间赫鲁晓夫向大会就这个问题作报告后，在28日的会议上就开始了讨论。一位位代表相继走上讲台，向大会转达了全国各地人民群众对苏共中央二月全会决议的一致拥护。
    代表们一致指出，改组机器拖拉机站不但有重大的实际意义，而且有深湛的理论价值。白俄罗斯代表阿夫西莫维奇说，改组拖拉机站的决议，是农业全盘集体化以来最重大的一次革命措施。许多代表都说，这项重大的改革是从实际出发的，它反映了人民的要求，也表明了苏联共产党在决定政策时同人民有着紧密的联系。只有教条主义者和保守主义者才不能了解这项改革的积极意义。
    从代表的发言中还可以看出，全体苏联人民，无论在城市或乡村，都对苏共这一决定表示了衷心的支持。乌克兰代表卡尔琴柯说，乌克兰的集体农庄是完全有条件和有力量来购买机器的。为了具体地说明这个问题，他举出了几个数字：1952年乌克兰所有集体农庄的现金收入是一百亿卢布，到1957年已增长为二百五十亿卢布
  （其中四十六亿卢布划为农庄的公积金）。乌克兰现有拖拉机站的机器总价值有多少呢？五十亿卢布。这就是说，去年集体农庄的公积金只要再加上四亿卢布，就可以买下拖拉机站的全部机器。目前乌克兰已经有两千个集体农庄保证今年可以把买机器的款交清，其它大部分农庄可以在两年之间付清这项费用。
    在讨论过程中，代表们也提出了许多问题和建议，例如拖拉机站改组以后会发生什么问题，这些问题又应当怎样解决等。代表们在发言中提出首先要加强对农庄的思想领导和技术上的帮助。俄罗斯联邦农业部长别?吉克托夫认为，区苏维埃应当经常召开技术会议，来了解下边的困难，并及时给予协助。关于农业机器的后备零件和汽油的供应问题，有人认为应当由技术修理站负责，有人认为农村供应社可以供应。但一致的意见是要把这些工作集中在一个地方，以免浪费人力。来自库班的代表波里扬斯基还提出了修改农业合作社示范规章和成立农业工作人员职工会的问题。由于农庄近年来公积金的增长，农业合作社示范规章中关于公积金不许超过农庄现金收入的20％的规定，已经过时了。此外，因为大部分农业工人转到农庄，他认为有必要成立农业工作人员职工会来照顾他们的福利。
    在会议上，代表们还根据亲身体验批评了那些认为把机器卖给集体农庄会削弱全民所有制的错误看法。代表们说，集体农庄买到机器以后会更加扩大自己的生产，会把更多的粮食交给国家。同时由于公积金的增长，他们还会建设更多的电站和学校，修筑更多的公路和住宅。这一切无疑地会把社会主义农业引向新的繁荣，并打下向共产主义过渡的基础。
