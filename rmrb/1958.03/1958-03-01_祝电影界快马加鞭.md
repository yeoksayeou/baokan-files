Wishing the Film Industry a Speedy Advance
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

At the production promotion meeting of various film studios convened by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, film workers voiced their heroic aspirations. In the wave of comparing with and catching up with the advanced, this year's production targets are changing daily and constantly rising. Finally, the film production workers, full of energy, challenged film workers across the country: increase film production and reduce production costs. The annual output of feature films has leaped from the original plan of fifty-two to seventy-five; the cost of black and white films has been reduced from the past 210,000 yuan to 140,000 yuan; and the filming time for each film has been reduced from eight months to five months.

This is indeed a leap forward. In terms of feature films, forty were shot last year, and thirty-five more will be shot this year than last year. This shows that after winning the victories of the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, our film workers, inspired by the high tide of industrial and agricultural production, have greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm, and are welcoming new battles with redoubled spirits. This kind of drive is a reliable guarantee for promoting our advancement.

Are there any difficulties? Of course, there are. For example, the foundation of film production—the script problem—is the most prominent. In the past, when only six films were produced throughout the year, there was a "script shortage." Now, jumping from the basis of producing forty feature films last year to seventy-five, the script supply naturally becomes even more problematic. However, the leaders, screenwriters, and directors of various film studios have all patted their chests, guaranteeing to overcome the difficulties. They have come up with various methods to solve the script problem. The slogan they put forward is: Leave no stone unturned, leave no thread untied. As for other difficulties, as long as everyone is full of energy and tries every means to find tricks and think of solutions, they can all be solved easily.

The key is whether there is a reliable ideological foundation. Here, we would like to raise a few questions for discussion with film workers.

First, last year, when revisionist ideas were rampant internationally and domestically, and right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack, a gust of wind also appeared in film production. Some film workers neglected the ideological content of the films, one-sidedly pursued taste, and one-sidedly emphasized the beauty of the picture. To this end, they did not hesitate to compete with each other for extravagance, making large amounts of silk and velvet clothing, building luxurious sets, taking planes to shoot on location everywhere, and even distorting the truth of life for this purpose. These situations fully show that in film production, not only is there a lot of waste, but more seriously, a considerable degree of bourgeois individualism and artistic ideas are rampant to a considerable extent. Without burning these bad things that are extremely harmful to the film industry, there is no talk of a leap forward. Film workers across the country must eliminate this phenomenon, and must thoroughly and deeply oppose waste and right-leaning conservative ideas, in order to promote work and achieve this year's new production targets.

Second, the fact that film production workers have proposed increasing film production and reducing production costs shows that the potential in film production is quite strong. To further tap the potential, we must first eliminate bureaucratic airs, eliminate extravagance, and eliminate squeamishness. Film factories must fully let go and mobilize the masses. This leap forward in production targets shows that the leadership's thinking is lagging behind the reality and lagging behind the enthusiasm of the masses. If the leadership is conservative, it will slow down the pace of progress. Only by resolutely relying on the masses and giving full play to the wisdom and talents of the masses can the impossible become possible, can we turn stone into gold, and can we produce films that are more, faster, better, and more economically.

Third, we must continue to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom." "Let a hundred flowers bloom" is always our policy for developing all literary and artistic undertakings. Film workers have made preliminary achievements in implementing this policy. The upcoming New Film Exhibition Week will be an exciting review. Our film art undertaking cannot be satisfied with just producing more films, but also the themes should be more extensive and the forms should be more diverse. Only in this way can the film art undertaking move forward more fully and richly. At the same time, we also hope that film workers will study hard, strengthen ties with reality, contact the masses, and insist on going to the countryside and factories to carry out labor training. Only by combining their own thoughts and their own hearts with the thoughts of the working people and the hearts of the working people, and truly becoming literary and artistic workers of the working class who are both red and expert, can film production rapidly reflect the faces of new people, new things, and new construction.

Last year's film audience has reached 2.05 billion. This shows that the socialist film industry, as a powerful weapon for educating the masses, is increasingly playing an important role. The leap forward in the film industry will also serve socialist construction better.

We wish film workers across the country to create films with educational significance and loved by the people in the competition to be advanced, catch up with the advanced, be more, faster, better, and more economical, and in the great leap forward. We wish the film art undertaking to bloom more brightly under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy. We also hope and wait for other teams in the literary and artistic circles to catch up quickly!

    祝电影界快马加鞭
    本报评论员
    在文化部电影局召集的各制片厂的生产促进会上，电影工作者发出了豪迈的声音。在比先进、赶先进的浪潮中，今年的生产指标天天变化，不断上升。最后鼓足干劲的电影制片工作者们向全国电影工作者提出挑战：增加影片生产，降低制片成本。艺术片年产量从原计划的五十二部跃进到七十五部；黑白片成本由过去的二十一万降低到十四万元；每部影片拍摄时间从八个月减少到五个月。
    这确实是个跃进。以故事片来说，去年拍了四十部，今年还要比去年多拍三十五部。这说明我们的电影工作者在取得整风运动和反右派斗争胜利之后，在工农业生产高潮的鼓舞下，大大地提高了社会主义觉悟和革命积极性，精神百倍地迎接新的战斗。这种干劲是促使我们前进再前进的可靠保证。
    有没有困难？当然有。例如电影生产的基础——剧本问题便是最为突出的一个。过去全年只出六部影片的时候都闹“剧本荒”，现在从去年出四十部艺术片的基础上一跃而出七十五部，剧本供应自然更成问题。但是，各制片厂的领导者、编剧、导演等都拍着胸脯，保证克服困难。他们想出各种办法，解决剧本问题。他们提出的口号是：无孔不钻，无线不牵。至于其他的困难，只要大家鼓起干劲，千方百计地找窍门，想办法，都可以迎刃而解的。
    关键还是在于思想上有没有可靠的基础。在这里，我们愿意提出几个问题，与电影工作者商榷。
    第一，在去年国际国内修正主义思想泛滥，右派分子猖狂进攻的情况下，电影制片工作中也出现了一股歪风。某些电影工作者忽视了影片的思想性，片面地追求趣味，片面地强调画面的漂亮美观。为此，他们不惜兢相奢侈，大做绸缎、丝绒服装，大搞豪华布景，坐飞机四出拍外景，甚至不惜为此歪曲生活的真实。这些情况充分表明，在电影生产中，不仅浪费很大，更严重的是在一定范围内泛滥着相当浓厚的资产阶级个人主义思想和艺术思想。不烧光这些极端危害电影事业的坏东西，就谈不到什么跃进。全国电影工作者必须消除这种现象，必须把反浪费、反右倾保守思想反深反透，才能促进工作，才能实现今年的生产新指标。
    第二，电影制片工作者提出的增加影片生产，降低制片成本这一事实表明，电影生产中的潜力是相当雄厚的。要做到进一步挖掘潜力，首先就得打掉官气，打掉阔气，打掉娇气。电影厂一定要充分地放手发动群众。这次生产指标的跃进，就说明领导思想是落后于实际、落后于群众的积极性的。领导一保守，就会使进展的脚步迟缓。只有坚决依靠群众，使群众智慧和才能得到充分的发挥，才能使不可能变成可能，才能点石成金，才能又多、又快、又好、又省地生产出影片来。
    第三，必须继续贯彻百花齐放的方针。“百花齐放”永远是我们发展一切文艺事业的方针。电影工作者在贯彻这个方针方面已经取得初步成绩。不久以后将要举行的新片展览周，将是一次令人兴奋的检阅。我们的电影艺术事业不能仅仅满足于出片多，而且题材要更加广泛，形式要更加多样，只有这样，才能使电影艺术事业更加充实、更加丰富地向前迈进。同时，也希望电影工作者努力学习，加强联系实际，联系群众，坚持下乡下厂进行劳动锻炼，只有把自己的思想、自己的心和劳动人民的思想、劳动人民的心结合在一起，真正成为工人阶级又红又专的文艺工作者，才能使影片生产能迅速地反映新人、新事、新建设的面貌。
    去年的电影观众已经达到二十亿五千万人次。这表明社会主义电影事业作为教育人民群众的有力武器，正在日益起着重要作用。电影事业的跃进，也一定会为社会主义建设服务得更好。
    我们预祝全国电影工作者们在比先进、赶先进，比多、比快、比好、比省和大跃进中，创作出富有教育意义、为人民喜爱的影片来。预祝电影艺术事业在党的文艺方针指导下，开出更加鲜艳的花朵。我们更希望、并且等待着文艺界其他队伍赶快追上前去！
