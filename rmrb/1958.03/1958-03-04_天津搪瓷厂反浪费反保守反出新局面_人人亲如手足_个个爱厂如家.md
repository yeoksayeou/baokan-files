Tianjin, March 3rd (By our own reporter) - In the campaign against waste and conservatism, the employees of the jointly-owned Tianjin Enamel Factory swept away bureaucratic airs, stagnation, and extravagance. After debating the relationship between personal interests and national interests, and the responsibilities of the working class, a new relationship of unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation has begun to form between individuals and the state, departments, and leaders and the masses. This is another profound change in the relations of production in this factory after the transformation of the ownership of the means of production.

The most significant feature of this change is the new atmosphere of loving the factory as home and saving every bit, which emerged after all employees debated the responsibilities of the working class. In the past, raw materials and semi-finished products were scattered all over the factory, waste cotton yarn and protective equipment were thrown everywhere, coal residue that was not completely burned in the baking ovens was treated as garbage, and no one was responsible for the semi-finished products made by the workers, resulting in a large amount of damage during transportation and storage. Some workers often went to the health station whether they were sick or not, wasting a lot of work hours. According to disclosures in this movement, the waste in this factory last year was worth more than 12,000 taels of gold. This is equivalent to wasting half a factory. The workers felt very distressed and realized that large waste is caused by the accumulation of many small wastes, and everyone should pay attention to saving every bit. Now, the workers pick up the broken gloves that were thrown away in the past, wash and mend them during breaks, and then reuse them. Young worker Yang Baoji saw that a lot of good coal was leaking from the baking ovens every day, so he sacrificed his lunch break every day to pick good coal from the coal ash, and in more than ten days he picked more than 1,500 jin. A new atmosphere of arriving early and leaving late has generally appeared in the factory.

Strengthening collaboration and mutual cooperation is another significant feature of this change. In the past, when problems occurred in production, departments often blamed each other. In order to strengthen the cooperation of the departments, the leadership had held many meetings, but due to the selfishness of departmentalism, these problems had not been resolved for a long time. There was also disunity among some workers. In this movement, workshops and groups that were related in production jointly held forums, each examined its shortcomings, and put forward guarantees. Workers in upper and lower processes strengthened the exchange of experiences. Young workers took the initiative to find veteran workers to be their mentors, and veteran workers proposed that they would no longer hold back on their technical skills.

Another feature of the change is that the leading cadres have changed their work style, gone deep into the masses, taken the initiative to care about production, cared about the workers' lives, eliminated the estrangement between leaders and the masses, and their relationship has become unprecedentedly close. They worked and rested with the workers in the workshops, and actively supported the workers' suggestions and creations in production. Wu Guang, the secretary of the Party branch, spent most of his time working in the workshop every day, studying production issues. He heard workers say that every year after the Spring Festival holiday, the quality decreased due to insufficient temperature when the furnaces were stopped. The day before work started this Spring Festival, he went to the workshop with the furnace foreman to start the furnace, ensuring that the furnace temperature was normal after work started the next day, so that thirteen of the fourteen groups in the entire workshop comprehensively overfulfilled their tasks in the first shift after the Spring Festival. The workers said, "Wu Guang has changed! We had a good start, thanks to his good idea."

### 天津搪瓷厂反浪费反保守反出新局面  人人亲如手足　个个爱厂如家

    天津搪瓷厂反浪费反保守反出新局面
    人人亲如手足　个个爱厂如家
    本报天津3日电　公私合营天津搪瓷厂职工在反浪费、反保守运动中，横扫了官气、暮气和阔气，辩论了个人利益和国家利益的关系、工人阶级的责任以后，在个人与国家之间、部门与部门之间、领导与群众之间，开始形成了团结互助、互相配合的新关系。这是这个厂继生产资料所有制改变以后，又一次生产关系的深刻变化。
    这种变化的最显著特征，是在全厂职工辩论了工人阶级的责任以后出现的爱厂如家、点滴节约的新风气。过去这个工厂的原料、半成品遍地都是，废棉纱、防护工具到处乱扔，烤版炉没有烧透的煤核也当垃圾处理，工人们制出半成品以后无人负责，在运输和存放当中造成了大量的残损。有些工人有病无病都常跑保健站，浪费了大量工时。据这次运动中揭发，这个工厂去年一年的浪费，就值一万二千多两黄金。这等于半个工厂浪费掉了。工人们感到十分痛心，认识到大浪费是由许多小浪费集中造成的，应该人人注意点滴节约。现在，工人们把过去扔掉的破手套拣起来，在休息时间洗补好了再用。青年工人杨宝基看到烤版炉每天漏下很多好煤，就每天牺牲中午的休息时间，从煤灰中拣好煤，十多天就拣了一千五百多斤。全厂普遍出现了早来晚走的新风气。
    加强协作、互相配合是这一变化的另一个显著特征。过去生产上发生问题，各部门往往互相埋怨。领导方面为了加强各部门的配合，曾经召开过多次会议，但是由于本位主义思想作怪，这些问题长期没有解决。部分工人之间也存在着不团结的现象。在这次运动中，生产上有联系的车间、小组都联合召开了座谈会，各自检查了缺点，提出了保证。上下工序的工人之间加强了经验交流。青年工人主动地找老工人拜师傅，老工人提出在技术上不再留一手。
    变化的另一个特征是领导干部改变了作风，深入群众，主动地关心生产，关心工人的生活，消除了领导同群众之间的隔阂，关系空前密切。他们在车间里和工人一起劳动，一起休息，积极支持工人在生产上的建议和创造。中共分支书记吴广每天大部分时间都在车间里干活，研究生产上的问题。他听到工人说每年春节放假以后，由于炉火停烧温度不够使质量下降。今年春节后上班的前一天，他就到车间和烧炉的工长一起生起炉火，保证了第二天上班后炉温正常，使今年春节开工后第一班全车间的十四个小组，有十三个全面超额完成了任务。工人们说：“吴广变了！我们开门红，多亏他的好主意。”
