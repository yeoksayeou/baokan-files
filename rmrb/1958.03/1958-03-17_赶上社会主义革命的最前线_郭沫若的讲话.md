Comrades, friends!

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and on the basis of the great victory of the anti-Rightist struggle last year, the nationwide rectification movement is still developing vigorously, unfolding a massive socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts throughout the country. The flames of anti-waste and anti-conservatism have swept through almost every corner, thoroughly burning away all official airs, extravagance, stagnation, arrogance, and squeamishness, rousing all 600 million people to adopt methods that are more, faster, better, and more economical to promote the cause of socialist construction.

The workers and peasants of the whole country have taken the lead in rousing themselves, and their production enthusiasm has soared to unprecedented heights, forming an unprecedented high tide on the production front. We are fully confident that our industrial production, in terms of steel and other major industrial products, will catch up with or surpass Great Britain in fifteen years or a little more. Our agricultural production, originally planned to be completed in ten years, can now be accomplished in only about seven years. Last winter and this spring, farmers across the country built a large number of water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area by 200 million mu, nearly matching the 230 million mu opened up by our ancestors before liberation in just four months. What an amazing great leap forward!

Chairman Mao said: The entire nation is striving vigorously and is full of hope; the great liberation of the productive forces of the working people is like the breaking of an atomic nucleus. We know that the breaking of an atomic nucleus can cause a chain reaction. Such a chain reaction has successively manifested itself in literature and art, science and technology, and other fields. Comrades in literary and artistic circles and in scientific and technological circles are formulating comprehensive plans and individual plans to serve the great leap forward in production, while also enabling literature and art and science and technology to make great leaps forward along with the great leap forward in production and construction.

This is an inevitable trend. The working class is the leading class of our country, and the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our country's political power. If the leading class and the foundation of political power are making a great leap forward, the subordinate components being led cannot be allowed not to follow suit. If they do not follow the great leap forward, they will become a burden to the leading class, hindering the progress of socialist construction. As patriotic citizens or organizations, that is absolutely not allowed. Today, the democratic parties and non-party democrats have initiated this Socialist Self-Remolding Promotion Conference, which can be said to be timely and meaningful. This precisely shows our determination: to be promoters rather than obstructors, to serve socialist construction, to serve the great leap forward in production, and to advance together with the great leap forward of workers and peasants.

To achieve this, how should we strive? First, we must transform our ideology and correct our political stance. We must thoroughly discard bourgeois ideology and transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers, into intellectuals of the working class. We must take workers and peasants as our teachers and learn from workers and peasants. In the past, we believed that "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," which was a fundamentally wrong idea, and we must thoroughly correct it. We must affirm and clearly recognize that workers and peasants are the creators of culture and our benefactors. We have lived to this day because they raised us. Without them, our food, clothing, and shelter would be a problem. If we have gained some knowledge, it is mainly due to their labor practice. We must put down our airs and hand over our knowledge. Young people must go to labor to be tempered, and older people must also establish a labor viewpoint. Only in this way can our ideology be truly transformed and our class stance gradually changed.

Everyone must be of one heart and one mind. We must hand over our hearts, to the organization, to each other. We must wholeheartedly follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party. Only with one heart and one mind can we summon up our energy, strive for the top, and build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a not-too-long period of time. Being of two or three minds will not work. With two or three minds, or even each person with their own mind, each going their own way, the result will only be the cancellation of strength. The greater the enthusiasm, the greater the cancellation. If everyone is of one heart and one mind, one person will have the strength of 600 million people. If each person has their own mind, 600 million people will not be worth the strength of one person. Capitalism is built on the basis of individualism, which is each person with their own mind. Today, should we take the capitalist road or the socialist road? Is the answer not clear? We must all be of one heart and one mind, follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, summon up our energy, and strive for the top.

Among the 600 million people, non-Party people should account for the largest majority. Therefore, non-Party people must especially intensify their socialist self-revolution. Otherwise, we will become the biggest burden and the biggest obstacle to the cause of national construction. Especially non-Party intellectuals, the problem is the greatest. In the old era, intellectuals were generally spokespersons for the ruling class, loyal subjects and filial sons of class rule. These people are the most lacking in labor viewpoint, and they look down on the working people the most. They are sycophantic to their superiors and arrogant to their inferiors. They are respectful and cautious to the ruling class and self-important to the working people. Seriously speaking, such intellectuals were all accomplices of the wicked in the old era, truly more guilty than Jie and Zhou. It is by no means accidental that many large, medium, and small Rightists emerged from among the intellectuals in the anti-Rightist struggle. Ideological revolution is more difficult than land revolution. Ideological revolution is revolutionizing oneself. Without a firm determination, one's class stance cannot be corrected. To become both red and expert working-class intellectuals, this should be said to be a great leap forward goal for us. What is said must be done, and we must strive to do it quickly.

History does not wait for people, and history is the least sentimental. The Chinese revolution is a revolution following another revolution, always to make Chinese society develop forward in a leaping manner. The whole country is galloping forward, and those who have fallen behind the team must spur on their horses and desperately catch up and rush to the forefront. As for non-Party intellectuals, I think we should set our goals higher and farther. We should have two account books: like "establishing a labor viewpoint, actively cultivating the thoughts and feelings of the working people," this is the lowest standard; beyond this, we should take striving to become a glorious Communist Party member as our highest standard of self-remolding. We must strive to cultivate a proletarian outlook on life, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, especially "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." We must read them thoroughly and study them carefully, and learn to use them to promote our practice. Only in this way can we guarantee that we will be both red and expert, and even more red and more expert. It is not enough to just talk. We must strike while the iron is hot and practice diligently. The social transformation of China is a revolution following another revolution, and the self-remolding of intellectuals must also be a revolution following another revolution.

The responsibility of intellectuals is very significant, and we must never belittle ourselves. Since the working people of China have spent countless efforts to cultivate us into intellectuals, we should not regard the knowledge we already have as private property, but thoroughly hand it over to serve the people and serve national construction. We should also not be satisfied with the knowledge we already have and not want to improve. We should constantly extract knowledge from the practice of the working people, from our own labor practice, and also absorb all advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and other countries, and supply the corresponding level of knowledge with the improvement of people's living needs and production and construction needs. Knowledge should be ahead of actual needs. For example, today has entered the era of atomic energy, the Soviet Union already has intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Soviet Union's two giant artificial earth satellites have already gone into space ahead of schedule. Without scientific and technological knowledge leading the way, these epoch-making feats would not be possible. Chinese intellectuals must also recognize this point. We should not shirk our responsibilities and make achievements.

The obvious situation has already been placed before us. The constantly developing situation of our great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production requires continuous and strong support in science and technology and cultural education. Especially the requirements for science and technology will only increase. The situation of continuous great leap forward in production inevitably requires a continuous great leap forward in science and technology. Therefore, scientists must strive to break through to higher levels to pioneer for the continuous great leap forward in production, and must also strive to spread out to the plane to serve as logistics for the continuous great leap forward in production. We must improve on the one hand, and popularize on the other hand. We must improve on the basis of popularization, and popularize under the guidance of improvement. This glorious task is very arduous, but we must shoulder it. It is our bounden duty and our inescapable responsibility.

In order to be able to shoulder such a task, we must carry out the current rectification movement to the end. We must set fire to ourselves, burning away the five airs on our bodies—official airs, extravagance, stagnation, arrogance, and squeamishness. We must experience the spirit of building the country through diligence and frugality, run science diligently and frugally, and run all undertakings diligently and frugally, striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results, avoiding less, slower, worse, and more expensive results, opposing conservatism and opposing waste, comparing our energy and comparing our advances, riding the socialist wind and breaking the capitalist waves, and preparing sufficient conditions for the continuous great leap forward of science and technology. At the same time, we must strengthen our scientific ranks. The highest standard is to make 600 million people both red and expert. This is not impossible, it is entirely possible. Under the socialist system, coupled with the greatest subjective efforts of each individual, many seemingly impossible things can become reality. I am for everyone, and everyone is for me; each according to their ability, each according to their needs—such an ideal society is bound to appear.

Comrades, let us work together! Please allow me to say it again, we must first transform ourselves into working-class intellectuals. What is said must be done, and it must be done quickly. Let us take out the strength we use to suckle and catch up closely, rushing to the forefront of the socialist revolution!

    赶上社会主义革命的最前线
    郭沫若的讲话
    同志们，朋友们！
    在中国共产党的领导下，在去年反右派斗争的伟大胜利的基础之上继续进行着的全民性的整风运动目前仍然在蓬蓬勃勃地进展，在全国范围内展开着轰轰烈烈的政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命。反浪费、反保守的烈火差不多烧遍了每一个角落，要把一切的官气、阔气、暮气、骄气、娇气彻底烧光，要把六亿人民全体振奋起来，采取多快好省的方法，促进社会主义建设事业。
    全国的工人农民首先振奋起来了，生产热情空前高涨，在生产战线上形成了空前未有的高潮。我们的工业生产，在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁和其他主要工业生产品方面，赶上或者超过英国，已经有着充分的把握。我们的农业生产，把原准备十年完成任务的农业发展纲要只消七年左右就可以完成了。去冬和今春，全国农民兴修了大量的水利工程，增加了灌溉面积两亿亩，仅仅四个月的工夫差不多赶上了解放前我们的祖先所开辟出的两亿三千万亩的面积。这是多么惊人的大跃进呵！
    毛主席说：全民族发扬蹈厉，大有希望；劳动人民的生产力的大解放就像原子核被冲破了一样。我们知道：原子核被冲破了是会引起连锁反应的。这样的连锁反应在文学艺术方面、科学技术方面和其它方面都陆续表现了出来，文艺界和科学技术界的同志们都在纷纷订出全面计划和个人计划，为生产大跃进服务，同时使文学艺术和科学技术也随着生产建设的大跃进而大跃进。
    这是必然的趋势。工人阶级是我们国家的领导阶级，工农联盟是我们国家的政权基础，领导阶级和政权基础都在大跃进，不能容许你被领导的附属成分不跟着大跃进。不跟着大跃进，那就会成为领导阶级的包袱，妨碍社会主义建设事业的进展，作为一个爱国的公民或者团体，那是绝对不能允许的。今天各民主党派和无党派民主人士发起了这个社会主义自我改造促进大会，应该说是及时的和有意义的。这正表示着我们具有了决心：要做促进派而不做促退派，要为社会主义建设服务，为生产大跃进服务，随着工人农民的大跃进而一道前进。
    要做到这样，我们应该怎样努力呢？我们首先就必须改造我们的思想意识，改正我们的政治立场。我们必须彻底丢掉资产阶级的思想意识，把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者，改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。我们要拜工人农民为老师，向工人和农民学习。以前我们相信“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”，那是根本错误的思想，我们要彻底改正过来。我们要肯定地认识清楚：工人农民是文化的创造者，是我们的恩人。我们活到今天，是他们把我们养大的。没有他们，我们的衣食住就成问题。我们如果有得一些知识，也主要是由于他们的劳动实践而获得的。我们要把架子放下去，把知识交出来。年青的人要到劳动中去接受锻炼，年老的人也要建立劳动观点。这样才能够使我们的思想意识得到真正的改造，使我们的阶级立场逐渐转变。
    大家要一条心。我们要把心交出来，向组织交出来，向彼此交出来。一心一意在共产党的领导下走社会主义的道路。要一心一意，才能鼓足干劲，力争上游，才能在不太长的时期内把中国建设成为有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义的强国。三心二意是不行的。三心二意，甚至一人一条心，各走各的方向，那结果只是力量的对消，干劲愈大，对消愈大。大家一条心，一个人就有六亿人的力量。一人一条心，六亿人抵不上一个人的力量。资本主义是建立在个人主义的基础上的，那就是一人一条心。到了今天，我们是应该走资本主义的道路，还是走社会主义的道路，答案不是明明白白的吗？我们一定要大家一条心，在共产党领导下走社会主义的道路，鼓足干劲、力争上游。
    在六亿人口中，无党无派的人应该占最大多数。因而无党派的人就要特别加紧社会主义的自我革命。不然，我们就要成为最大的包袱，要成为国家建设事业中的最大的障碍。特别是无党无派的知识分子，问题最大。知识分子在旧时代一般都是统治阶级的代言人，阶级统治的忠臣孝子。这种人是最缺乏劳动观点的，他们最看不起劳动人民。他们谄上傲下，对于统治阶级是必恭必敬，对于劳动人民是唯我独尊。认真说，这样的知识分子在旧时代就都是助桀为虐的狗腿子，他们倒真正是罪浮于桀纣的。在反右派斗争中，从知识分子里面涌现出了不少的大中小的右派，决不是偶然的事。思想革命比土地革命还要困难。思想革命是革自己的命，不痛下决心，自己的阶级立场是改正不过来的。要成为又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子，这应该说是我们的一个大跃进的目标。说到总要做到，而且要争取时间赶快做到。
    历史是不等待人的，历史是最不讲情面的。中国革命是一个革命紧接着一个革命，始终是要使中国社会以跃进的体势向前发展。全国都在万马奔腾，比较掉在队伍后边的人特别要快马加鞭，拼命地紧追紧赶，赶到最前线上去。无党派的知识分子，我认为，我们应该把自己的目标悬得更高更远一些。我们应该有两本账簿子：像“树立劳动观点、积极培养劳动人民所具有的思想感情”，这是最低的标准；在这之外，我们应该把争取成为光荣的共产党员，作为我们的自我改造的最高标准。我们必须努力培养无产阶级的人生观，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，特别是“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，我们必须熟读精读，并学习运用来推动我们的实践。要这样我们才能有保证做到又红又专、更红更专。光说是不行的，一定要趁热打铁、刻苦实践。中国的社会改造是一个革命紧接着一个革命，知识分子的自我改造也必须是一个革命紧接着一个革命。
    知识分子的责任是很重大的，我们也决不要妄自菲薄。中国的劳动人民既费了无数的心血把我们培养成为了知识分子，我们就不应该把已有的知识当成私有，要彻底交来为人民服务，为国家建设服务。我们也不应该满足于已有的知识而不想精进，我们应该不断地从劳动人民的实践中、从自己的劳动实践中提炼出知识，更还要从苏联、从别的国家吸取一切先进经验，随着人民生活需要和生产建设需要的提高而供应出相应高度的知识。知识应该要走在实际需要的前头。例如今天已经进入了原子能的时代，苏联已经有了洲际弹道火箭，苏联的两颗巨大的人造地球卫星已经提前上了天，没有科学技术上的知识领头这些划时代的事迹是不可能实现的。中国的知识分子也必须认识到这一点，我们应该当仁不让，做出成绩出来。
    很明显的局势已经摆在我们的面前，我们的工农业生产大跃进不断发展的形势就需要有科学技术、文化教育上不断的大力支援。特别是对于科学技术上的要求是会有增无已的，生产不断大跃进的形势必然要求科学技术的不断大跃进。因此，科学家们必须努力向高层突破为不断的生产大跃进打先锋，也必须努力向平面铺开为不断的生产大跃进作后勤。我们一面要提高，一面要普及，要在普及的基础上提高，提高的指导下普及。这光荣的任务是十分艰巨的，但我们必须担负起来。义不容辞，责无旁贷。
    为了能担负起这样的任务，我们必须把当前的整风运动贯彻到底。我们一定要引火烧身，把自己身上的五气——官气、阔气、暮气、骄气、娇气烧毁干净。体验着勤俭建国的精神来勤俭办科学、勤俭办一切事业，力图多快好省，而避免少慢差费，反保守、反浪费，比干劲、比先进，乘社会主义的风，破资本主义的浪，为科学技术的不断大跃进准备充分的条件。同时，我们还必须壮大我们的科学队伍，最高的标准就是要使六亿人民都成为又红又专。这不是不可能的事，是完全有可能的。在社会主义制度下，加上每一个人的最大的主观努力，许多看来不可能的事都可以成为现实。我为人人，人人为我；各尽所能、各取其需——这样的理想社会是必然要出现的。
    同志们，让我们共同努力吧！请允许我再说一遍，我们首先一定要把自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，说到一定要做到，而且要赶快做到。让我们拿出吃奶的力量来，紧追紧赶，赶到社会主义革命的最前线去！
