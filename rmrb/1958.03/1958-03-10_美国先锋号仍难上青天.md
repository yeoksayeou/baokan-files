    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th—America's "Vanguard" rocket is still finding it difficult to reach the heavens. According to news from the Cape Canaveral rocket test site in Florida, American authorities tried to launch the "Vanguard" rocket multiple times on March 7th and 8th, but were unsuccessful each time. On the 8th alone, there were three announcements of imminent launches, but each time "difficulties" were discovered, preventing ignition and launch.
    According to a report from the U.S. Department of Defense, one of the reasons for the "Vanguard" rocket's failure to launch is that final tests are still needed on how to separate the second-stage rocket from the first, how to ignite the second-stage rocket at the appropriate altitude, and how to control the rocket's flight.

    美国先锋号仍难上青天
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的“先锋号”火箭仍然是上天难。据来自佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角火箭试验场的消息说，在3月7日和8日，美国有关当局曾经多次想试射“先锋”火箭，但是始终没有成功。单是在8日一天，就有三次说要发射了，结果却每次都发现了“困难”而没有点火发射。
    据美国国防部的报告说，“先锋”火箭未能发射的原因之一是如何使第二节火箭同第一节脱离、如何使第二节火箭能够在适当的高度点火以及如何控制火箭的飞行等都还要作最后的试验。
