Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 8th March: Shixian Paper Mill workers, before dawn on the 8th, achieved an average cooking time of three hours and fifty-five minutes for four batches of unbleached wood pulp; one batch only took three hours and forty-eight minutes, shortening the record created by Kaishantun Paper Mill on the 6th by another twenty-two minutes. The quality of all four batches of pulp reached the first-class standard.

    Shixian Paper Mill has consistently been among the more advanced mills in the country in terms of pulp cooking time. This year, in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, they have continuously created new records in just over two months, shortening the latest record by three hours and eighteen minutes compared to the end of last year.

    After the new record of Shixian Paper Mill spread, Kaishantun Paper Mill workers held an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 8th. Many people proposed to break through three hours and thirty minutes to surpass Shixian again.

    Jilin Paper Mill, which jointly proposed a competition with Shixian and Kaishantun factories to all paper mills across the country, is a factory mainly producing newsprint. This factory has already sent people to Shixian and Kaishantun on the night of the 6th to learn from their experience.

    石岘再次赶过开山屯
    新华社长春8日电石岘造纸厂职工在8日拂晓前有四锅本色木浆每锅平均蒸煮时间降到三时五十五分；其中有一锅只用了三时四十八分，比开山屯造纸厂6日创造的纪录又缩短了二十二分。四锅纸浆的质量都达到了一级品标准。
    石岘造纸厂在纸浆蒸煮时间方面一直是全国几个大型制浆厂中较先进的工厂。今年在反浪费反保守运动中，仅仅两个月零几天，他们连续创造的最新纪录，比去年底的纪录缩短了三时十八分。
    石岘造纸厂的新纪录传出以后，开山屯造纸厂职工8日下午召开紧急会议，许多人提出要突破三时三十分再次赶过石岘。
    和石岘、开山屯厂联合向全国各造纸厂提出倡议开展竞赛的吉林造纸厂，是以生产新闻纸为主的工厂。这个厂已在6日夜间派人赶往石岘、开山屯学习经验。
