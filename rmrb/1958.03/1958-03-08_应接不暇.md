Editor's Notes

    Overwhelmed
    In the evening, I had just finished editing the news that the wood pulp cooking time of the Kai Shantung Paper Mill had surpassed the world's advanced Canadian level, and before the excitement had calmed down, I received news that the Shihsien Paper Mill had surpassed Kai Shantung. I had just added this news to the page proof when the Xinhua News Agency sent news that Kai Shantung had surpassed Shihsien again. Such a leap-forward speed almost overwhelms us editors.
    One industry, three successive reports of victory in one night, this is the characteristic of life in our era, this is the heroic nature of China's working class. With the vigorous progress of the revolutionary competition of comparing with the advanced, comparing in more, faster, better, and more economical ways, there will certainly be more and more happy events that overwhelm newspapers.
    Heroes from all walks of life, tell us your good news in the fastest way, so that we can spread your leap-forward voice to the world.

    应接不暇
    晚上，刚刚编完开山屯造纸厂木浆蒸煮时间赶过世界先进的加拿大水平的消息，兴奋的心情还没有平静，又接到了石岘造纸厂赶过开山屯的消息。刚刚把这个新闻添在版样上，新华社又送来了开山屯又赶过石岘的消息。这样的跃进速度，我们做编辑工作的，几乎应接不暇了。
    一个行业，一夜三传捷报，这就是我们这个时代的生活特征，这就是我国工人阶级的英雄本色。随着比先进，比多快好省的革命竞赛蓬勃进展，这种使报纸应接不暇的喜事，一定会越来越多。
    各行各业的英雄们，把你们的捷报用最快的方法告诉我们，让我们向全世界传播你们跃进的声音。
