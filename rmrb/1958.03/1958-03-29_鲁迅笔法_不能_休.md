“Lu Xun's Writing Style” Cannot "Rest"
    Hong Fu
    The article "Sweep Away the Stink of the Scholar!" written by Lin Fang and published in the "Essays" column of the Shanghai Xinmin Evening News on March 3rd, is very good in its praise of the masses' big-character posters and its advocacy of learning the "language art of the masses as masters" in our country's comfortable, lively, and vibrant political situation. However, the author's suggestion in the article that "Lu Xun's writing style 'can rest'," is not necessarily appropriate, and it is also a bit simplistic to lump the pedantry and sourness of intellectuals together with "Lu Xun's writing style."

    I believe that the basic characteristics of "Lu Xun's writing style" are clear love and hate, deep understanding of principles, brevity and liveliness, and accuracy and clarity. The vitality and combativeness of "Lu Xun's writing style" lie here. "Lu Xun's writing style" is diverse, with the essay form being the most frequently used. However, Lu Xun's articles, regardless of their form, are all permeated with a central idea. In his own words, it is: "Fiercely browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, Head-bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children." In his writing, he was fearless of any ferocious enemy, fully demonstrating the spirit of the Chinese people's fearlessness. He unconditionally "opened his heart" to the masses, and through his articles, he frequently exchanged ideas with the masses. He never used his pen to mock or attack the revolutionary people and the revolutionary party. Moreover, his serious attitude towards writing, the rigor of his logic, the refinement of his diction, and the boldness and profundity of his expression can be said to have reached the pinnacle of perfection. Of course, due to the era in which Lu Xun lived, which was an era ruled by dark forces, he had to use satirical essay forms to fight against the enemy, so his writing inevitably had obscure and circuitous aspects. But this cannot be considered the main point of "Lu Xun's writing style."

    In the socialist era, the masses fully enjoy democracy and freedom. The language we use in writing should of course be the language of the masses, and should be adapted to the needs of socialism and the literary style needed by the masses, and should not be obscure and circuitous. From this point of view, it is correct not to rigidly learn the obscure and circuitous elements in "Lu Xun's writing style" and not to simply imitate the form of Lu Xun's articles. But if we sweep away "Lu Xun's writing style" altogether without analysis, saying that "'Lu Xun's writing style' can be studied, but need not be learned," then it would be too absolute.

    "Lu Xun's writing style" is one of the important heritages in our country's cultural treasure house. Why "need not be learned"? The question is how to learn? What to learn? Many of us are enthusiastically learning "Lu Xun's writing style," but due to unstable standpoints and incorrect methods, we often slip onto the wrong path. When using the weapon of satire, they are not good at distinguishing between dealing with enemies, dealing with allies, and dealing with their own comrades. Therefore, they abuse satire. However, as long as we truly stand on the side of the people, and use the attitude of protecting the people and educating the people, to learn Lu Xun's spirit, and to learn the genuine love for the people and the well-intentioned criticism of the people's own shortcomings in "Lu Xun's writing style," even if it is very sharp, it is what we need. The many big-character posters before us are proof of this. As for Lu Xun's serious and earnest attitude towards writing and his lively, fresh, and powerful writing style, we must study them well.

    Will anyone use the name of "Lu Xun's writing style" to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities? There are such people. Bourgeois right-wingers have played this trick. Xu Maoyong and his ilk are examples. No matter how cleverly a fox in sheep's clothing disguises itself, people can see through it at a glance. If Mr. Lu Xun were still alive, he would certainly be with the people, using a sharp "dagger" to hit the fox's vital point. Of course, he would also use his "writing style" to sing the praises of the new socialist era and the great people of the new era, just like singing a triumphant song.

### “鲁迅笔法”不能“休”

    “鲁迅笔法”不能“休”
    洪夫
    3月3日上海新民晚报“随笔”栏刊登林放所写“扫除酸气！”一文，其中对于群众大字报的称颂，对于在我国舒畅、生动、活泼的政治局面下，应该学习“群众主人翁的语言艺术”的倡议，都是很好的。但是作者在文章中提出：“鲁迅笔法‘可以休矣’”，这就未必妥当，并且将知识分子的冬烘气和酸腐气同“鲁迅笔法”混为一谈，也有点简单化了。
    我认为“鲁迅笔法”的基本的特点就是爱憎分明、深谙事理、简短生动、准确鲜明。“鲁迅笔法”的生命力和战斗性，就在这里。“鲁迅笔法”是多种多样的，其使用较多的要算杂文形式了。但是鲁迅的文章不论哪种形式，都贯串着一个中心思想。用他自己的话说即是：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”。在他的笔下，他对任何凶恶的敌人都是无所恐惧，充分表现了中国人民大无畏的精神。他对人民群众则是无条件的“交心”，通过他的文章经常和人民群众交流思想，他从未用他的笔嘲笑和攻击革命人民和革命政党。而且做文章态度的认真、逻辑的严谨、词章的讲究，以及表达思想的泼辣、深刻，真可以说是登峰造极。当然，由于鲁迅所处的时代，是黑暗势力统治的时代，在同敌人作斗争中，他不得不去用冷嘲热讽的杂文形式作战，因此，文字中不免有隐晦曲折之处。但这不能认为是“鲁迅笔法”的主要点。
    在社会主义的时代，人民群众充分享受民主自由，我们写文章所使用的语言，当然应该是群众的语言，应该适应社会主义的需要，适应人民群众需要的文风，而不要隐晦曲折。从这一点上来说，不去生硬地学习“鲁迅笔法”中的隐晦曲折，不去简单地模仿鲁迅文章的形式，那是正确的。但如果不加分析地将“鲁迅笔法”一概扫掉，说“‘鲁迅笔法’可研究，不必学”，那就未免太绝对化了。
    “鲁迅笔法”是我国文化宝库中的重要遗产之一。我们为什么“不必学”呢？问题是怎样学？学什么？我们有不少人热心地学习“鲁迅笔法”，可是由于立场不稳，方法不对，往往溜到错误的道路上去。他们在使用讽刺的武器的时候，不善于区别对付敌人、对付同盟者和对付自己同志之间的区别。因而滥用讽刺。但是，只要是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的态度，去学习鲁迅的精神，学习“鲁迅笔法”中对人民的真正热爱和对人民自己缺点的善意的批评。即使十分尖锐，也是我们所需要的。眼前的许多大字报就是证明。至于对于鲁迅做文章的那种严肃认真的态度和生动活泼新鲜有力的文风，更要好好地学习。
    是不是有人会假“鲁迅笔法”之名，行其反党反社会主义之实呢？那是有的。资产阶级右派分子就曾耍过这个伎俩。如徐懋庸之流即是。蒙着羊皮的狐狸，不管他装扮得如何巧妙，人们是可以一眼望穿的。鲁迅先生如果还活着的话，他必然会和人民在一起，用锋利的“匕首”击中狐狸的要害。当然，他更会用他的“笔法”像高唱凯歌一般地赞颂社会主义新时代，赞颂新时代的伟大人民。
