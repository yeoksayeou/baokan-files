Putting Politics in Command is a Guarantee of Running Enterprises Thriftily

How can we thoroughly implement the policy of running enterprises thriftily in construction enterprises? The experience of the Nantong City Construction Engineering Company, published in today's newspaper, provides a correct answer.

What are the outstanding characteristics of this company's production? The main thing is that they have solved three major issues in enterprise management: (1) Basically eliminated idle work in planning management and labor organization. In 1956, they achieved zero idle workdays, and in 1957, only 46 workdays were idle. (2) In the management of building materials, they achieved both no stockpiling or waste, and no work stoppages due to lack of materials, basically achieving "work completed, materials exhausted, site cleared." In 1957, the company had a total of 121 construction sites, of which 102 achieved "work completed, materials exhausted," excluding 12 sites with projects spanning multiple years. Five sites had leftover materials due to sudden task reductions, etc.; only two sites had leftover materials due to poor planning and lax control.
(3) Greatly saved on indirect expenses in cost management. The company's indirect expenses have always been lower than the national standard, and have generally decreased year by year; administrative management fees have had surpluses every year. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the company saved a total of 796,235 yuan in indirect expenses for the state, of which 300,234 yuan were administrative management fees.

These achievements may seem ordinary. However, currently, the management of some construction enterprises is still in a state of "labor losing money, materials 'making' money, management fees overspending"; some construction enterprises still have the phenomenon of wide margins for use, stockpiling and waste in material management; and some construction enterprises still take a passive attitude towards the issue of balanced construction throughout the year. In this stark contrast, the experience of Nantong Company in creating a thrifty enterprise is particularly worthy of recommendation.

What is the reason for Nantong Company's outstanding achievements? An important reason is that they put the work of running enterprises thriftily under the strong political leadership of the Party, so that all economic and technical work in the enterprise is placed under the command of politics. In their own words, this is called "putting politics in command."

How do they implement "putting politics in command" in the process of implementing the policy of running enterprises thriftily? What are their main experiences?

First of all, the leading cadres of Nantong Company have maintained and promoted the glorious tradition of hard work of the Party in the enterprise. In their activities of participating in production and leading production, they have become models of careful calculation and thrift; in their daily life style, they have become models of bearing hardships before enjoying comforts, being simple and hardworking, and enduring hardships. In overcoming various difficulties in running enterprises thriftily, they all set an example, using their practical actions of closely caring for the enterprise to influence the masses of workers. In this way, they truly put down the "master" airs, eliminated officialdom, used their practical actions to show that they are just ordinary workers, truly treated the masses with an equal attitude, and made the masses feel that they are indeed the masters of the enterprise, and that the relationship between them and the enterprise leaders is indeed an equal relationship. Comrade Lu Xiugen, the deputy manager of this company, not only led production at the construction site, but also worked as an excellent and diligent ordinary worker. He often did heavy labor work with everyone, and he collected scraps, leftover materials, and remnants on the construction site at any time, using practical actions to influence grassroots cadres and workers to cherish every brick, every piece of wood, every tile, and every stone. He not only lived with the masses on the construction site, but also did many miscellaneous tasks, even carrying urine buckets and pouring urine for everyone, leading everyone to clean up and reduce the use of odd-job workers on the construction site. On business trips, in order to save state expenses, he often used the station and the communication room of the organ as a hotel; he often carried luggage on his shoulders and walked on foot when going to and from the station or wharf, refusing to hire a car. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient office space, the company once renovated a 600-square-meter office building and a 200-square-meter canteen with only more than 900 yuan, with the company manager and party secretary taking the lead, party and government cadres doing heavy labor, and technical cadres doing skilled labor. Don't the images of these leaders of Nantong Company reflect the true colors of our simple laboring people? Don't they bring the fine traditions of our Party in the revolutionary war years and the style of the "old Eighth Route Army" to the enterprise? The leaders of Nantong Company have won the trust of the masses with their exemplary actions, implemented the policy of running enterprises thriftily, cultivated the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters of the country, established a true socialist relationship between leaders and the masses, and on this basis, gave play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers.

Secondly, the party organization and administrative leaders of Nantong Company have persistently carried out political and ideological work for all employees, truly turning the Party's policy of running enterprises thriftily into the conscious action of the masses. One of their effective methods is to seize on daily examples of waste to conduct education. Another method is to repeatedly insist on opposing waste. Where there is waste, there is opposition; when there is waste, there is opposition; if it is estimated that waste will occur, education to prevent waste is carried out in a timely manner. For example, when one of their work areas was about to transfer to Shanghai, they timely proposed: "After entering the big city, we must consistently maintain the style of hard struggle and careful calculation." Later, some waste still occurred in the Shanghai work area, and the company leaders timely organized an anti-waste movement, so that this work area always maintained a thrifty style. They also combined with year-end summaries to carry out an annual anti-waste movement, and on this basis, revised unreasonable rules and regulations. Through these measures, the idea of running enterprises thriftily and careful calculation has indeed taken root in people's hearts and become a trend, infiltrating into the office like mercury, penetrating into the construction site, penetrating into business trips, and finally condensing into more, faster, better, and more economical indicators.

Once the idea of running enterprises thriftily is rooted in the sense of responsibility of the master of the country, it will exert immeasurable power. A large part of the employees of Nantong Company completely treat the country's construction tasks with the attitude of the master of the country and cherish the country's property. In order to save the cost of temporary facilities, many construction sites do not build sheds; temples and monasteries, corridors of houses, sluice gates of water conservancy projects, etc. have become their residences. Among them, there are such section chiefs: year after year, they patrol the construction sites, nearly dozens of miles away, and more than two hundred miles away. They often ride a bicycle, bring a bag of cold rice, do not go to restaurants during the day, and do not stay in hotels at night. Among them, there are such workers: in order to cherish materials, they always use "zero before whole" when using materials. Because they often piece together broken materials, they cannot get extra wages. When others asked him why he did this, he replied: "Wages are my own, materials are the country's. If socialist construction is not good, wages cannot be increased!" The vast majority of technicians among them have mastered a variety of technologies. When assigning tasks, they do everything and rarely pick and choose or bargain.

Nantong Company was able to successfully implement the policy of running enterprises thriftily because the leaders here truly established the idea of wholeheartedly serving socialist construction. They realized that the position they stand on is to specifically serve socialist construction by serving the construction unit. Therefore, they can do everything possible to meet the requirements of national construction, and can take the initiative to create conditions to solve the difficulties for the construction unit. In order to meet the needs of the construction unit, and also to complete the construction tasks as much as possible, in terms of service scope, they not only build houses and factories, but also build water conservancy projects and bridges, culverts, and even fish ponds, toilets, and fences, and do all kinds of odd jobs of repairing odds and ends. As long as they can do more work for socialist construction, as long as they can achieve no idle work, they will do it even without profit. They have adopted the attitude of the master towards the national construction cause, their service concept, service attitude, and management style are full of the sense of responsibility of the master, and their relationship with the construction unit is a normal socialist cooperative relationship.

Wholeheartedly serving socialist construction is the highest principle of cooperation between construction units and construction enterprises. Over the past few years, we have followed this principle, and the relationship between construction units and construction enterprises has been basically normal. However, there are also some construction units and construction enterprises that do not completely follow this principle. This situation has caused some unnecessary losses to the basic construction work over the past few years. If all construction enterprise units can actively serve the construction unit like Nantong Company, if the construction unit also adheres to the spirit of wholeheartedly serving socialist construction, cares about each other's difficulties, and overcomes difficulties with one heart and one mind, can't many problems be easily solved?

Nantong Company's experience is a very good experience. Because it has achieved "putting politics in command," it has grasped the key to running enterprises thriftily. Its "putting politics in command" is not empty shouting, not academic preaching, but leaders setting an example and educating the masses of workers through practical actions, twisting political work and economic work into one rope. Whoever learns this set of methods can gradually master the art of leading and managing socialist enterprises.

    政治挂帅是勤俭办企业的保证
    在建筑企业里，如何贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针？今天本报发表的南通市建筑工程公司的经验，提供了一个正确的答案。
    这个公司的生产中有什么突出的特点呢？主要是他们在企业管理上解决了三大课题：（一）在计划管理和劳动组织上基本上消灭了窝工。1956年做到了不窝一个工日，1957年仅窝了四十六个工日。（二）在建筑材料管理上做到了既不积压浪费，又不停工待料，基本上做到了“工完料尽，场地清净”。1957年这个公司共有一百二十一个工地，其中除去十二个工地有跨年度工程以外，做到“工完料尽”的有一百零二个工地，由于突然削减任务等原因剩下材料的有五个工地；因为计划不周、控制不严而有剩料的仅有两个工地。
  （三）在成本管理上大大地节约了间接费用的支出。这个公司历年的间接费开支都低于国家规定的标准，而且大体上是逐年降低；行政管理费更是年年都有节余。第一个五年计划期间，这个公司总共为国家节约间接费七十九万六千二百三十五元，其中行政管理费有三十万零二千三百三十四元。
    这些方面的成绩，说起来也许平凡。但是，目前有一批建筑企业的经营管理，还处在
  “人工赔本，材料‘赚’钱，管理费超支”的情况下；某些建筑企业的材料管理，仍有宽打窄用、积压浪费的现象；还有些建筑企业在全年均衡施工的问题上，仍然采取消极态度。在这种鲜明的对比之下，南通公司所创造的勤俭办企业的经验，就特别值得推荐了。
    南通公司做出这样出色的成绩，其原因何在呢？一个重要原因是，他们把勤俭办企业这件工作放在党的坚强的政治领导下来进行，使企业中的各项经济技术工作都置于政治的统帅之下。用他们自己的话来讲，就叫作“政治挂帅”。
    他们是怎样在贯彻勤俭办企业方针的过程中实行“政治挂帅”的呢？他们的主要经验是什么呢？
    首先，南通公司的领导干部把党的艰苦奋斗的光荣传统在企业中保持和发扬了起来。他们在参加生产、领导生产的活动中，成为精打细算、克勤克俭的榜样；他们在日常的生活作风中，成为吃苦在前、享受在后，艰苦朴素、刻苦耐劳的榜样；他们在克服勤俭办企业的各种困难中，都以身作则，用自己密切关怀企业的实际行动来影响职工群众。这样，他们就真正放下了“老爷”架子，打掉了官气，用自己的实际行动来表明自己只不过是一个普通的劳动者，真正以平等的态度对待群众，使群众亲切地体会到自己确实是企业的主人，确实和企业领导者之间的关系是一种平等的关系。这个公司的副经理陆修根同志到了工地，不仅在那里领导生产，还做一个出色的勤勤恳恳的普通工人。他经常和大家一块做壮工活，他随时随地收拾工地的零料、剩料和残料，以实际行动影响基层干部和工人群众都珍惜一砖一木、一瓦一石。他在工地不仅和群众一块住宿，还做许多杂务工作，甚至给大家挑尿桶倒尿，带动大家都亲自动手打扫卫生，减少了工地的勤杂用工。他在出差的旅途中，为了节省国家开支，常常拿车站和机关的传达室当旅馆；上下车站或轮船码头，经常肩挑行李，两脚步行，不肯雇车。这个公司为了解决办公用房不足的困难，曾经在公司经理和党委书记带头下，党政干部做壮工活，技术干部做技工活，只用九百多元就翻修了一座六百平方公尺的办公楼和二百平方公尺的食堂。南通公司的这些领导者的形象，难道不正是体现了我国淳朴的劳动人民的本色吗？难道不正是把我们党在革命战争年代的优良传统和“老八路”作风带到企业里来了吗？南通公司的领导者以自己的模范行动取得了群众的信赖，贯彻了勤俭办企业的方针，培养了职工群众的国家主人翁思想，树立了领导和群众之间的一种真正的社会主义关系，并在这种关系的基础上发挥了职工群众的积极性和创造性。
    其次，南通公司的党组织和行政领导者，坚持不懈地对全体职工进行政治思想工作，把党的勤俭办企业的方针真正变为群众的自觉行动。他们的有效方法之一，是抓住日常的浪费事例进行教育。另一个办法，是反复地坚持反浪费。哪里有浪费就在哪里反；什么时候有浪费就在什么时候反；估计到将要发生浪费现象，就及时进行防止浪费的教育。例如，当他们的一个工区将要转移到上海的时候，他们就适时地提出：“进入大城市以后，要始终如一地保持艰苦奋斗、精打细算的作风”。以后，上海工区还是发生了一些浪费现象，公司领导方面又及时组织了反浪费运动，使这个工区始终保持了勤俭作风。他们还结合年终总结，开展一年一度的反浪费运动，并且在这个基础上修改不合理的规章制度。通过这些措施，勤俭办企业和精打细算的思想确已深入人心，成为风气，像水银泻地一般，无孔不入地深入到办公室去，深入到施工现场去，深入到出差的旅途中去，最后凝结到多快好省的指标上去。
    勤俭办企业的思想一经扎根在国家主人翁思想的基础上，它就会发挥出不可限量的威力。南通公司很大一部分职工，就是完全以国家主人翁的态度来对待国家的建设任务，爱护国家的财产。为了节省临时设施费用的开支，许多工地不搭工棚；庙宇和寺院、房屋的走廊、水利工程的闸洞等地都成了他们的住处。他们当中，有这样的工段长：经年累月，巡回工地，近则数十里，远则二百多里，他们经常是骑上一辆自行车，带上一包冷饭，白天不进饭馆，晚间不住客栈。他们当中，有这样的工人：为了爱惜材料，用料时总是“先零后整”。因为经常拼碎料，拿不到超额工资。别人问他为什么这样干，他回答说：“工资是自己的，材料是国家的。社会主义建设不好，工资也不能提高！”他们当中的绝大多数技工掌握了多种技术，在分配任务时，什么都干，很少发生挑肥拣瘦、讨价还价的现象。
    南通公司所以出色地贯彻执行了勤俭办企业的方针，还因为这里的领导干部真正树立了全心全意为社会主义建设服务的思想。他们认识到他们所站的岗位，就是通过为建设单位服务来具体地为社会主义建设服务。因此，他们能够千方百计满足国家建设的要求，能够主动地创造条件，为建设单位解决困难。为了满足建设单位的需要，也为了尽可能多地完成施工任务，他们在服务范围上，不仅是盖房子，盖工厂，还修建水利工程和桥梁、涵洞，甚至鱼池、厕所、篱笆，并且做种种修零补旧的杂活。只要能够为社会主义建设多干活，只要能够做到不窝工，没有利润也干。他们对国家建设事业采取了主人翁的态度，他们的服务观点、服务态度和经营作风，充满了主人翁的责任感，他们和建设单位的关系是一种正常的社会主义的协作关系。
    全心全意为社会主义建设服务，这是建设单位和建筑企业双方进行协作的最高原则。几年来我们遵循了这个原则，建设单位和建筑企业的关系基本上是正常的。但是，也有某些建设单位和建筑企业并不是完全按照这一原则办事。这种情况使得几年来的基本建设工作多多少少地受到了一些不应有的损失。如果所有的建筑企业单位都能够像南通公司那样积极主动地为建设单位服务，如果建设单位也都本着全心全意为社会主义建设服务的精神，体贴对方的困难，同心协力地克服困难，很多问题不就可以迎刃而解了吗？
    南通公司的经验是一个很好的经验。它因为实现了“政治挂帅”，就抓起了勤俭办企业之纲。它的“政治挂帅”，不是空洞的叫喊，不是学究式的说教，而是领导干部以身作则，通过实际行动来教育职工群众，把政治工作和经济工作拧成一根绳。谁要是学会了这一套，谁就可以逐步地掌握领导和管理社会主义企业的艺术。
