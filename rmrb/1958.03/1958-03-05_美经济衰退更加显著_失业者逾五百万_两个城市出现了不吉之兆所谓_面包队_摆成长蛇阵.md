Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from New York: According to a report on the 3rd by the Kyodo News Agency's New York correspondent, the current economic recession in the United States is unexpectedly deep, and the number of unemployed has finally exceeded the five million mark.

The reporter said that in early February this year, "breadlines"—queues for receiving relief food from the municipal authorities—appeared in the cities of Memphis, Tennessee, and Lauren, Ohio. This gave Americans, who had been "boasting about prosperity" for a long time, a "great shock." Breadlines were seen everywhere in early 1955, but had not been seen for a long time afterward. Therefore, Americans felt that breadlines were an "ominous sign."

The reporter said that if you walk down the streets of New York now, you will feel that the signs for "offices for rent" and "shops for rent" have increased a lot, and advertisements for cheap sales of household electrical appliances such as televisions, electric washing machines, and electric vacuum cleaners are also very conspicuous. The biggest concern of American housewives now is rising prices, especially the rise in food and rent, which are indispensable in daily life, and it seems that every housewife is sighing. "Although the economy is in recession, prices are still rising" - this is the latest characteristic of the American market.

The phenomenon of salaried workers gradually losing their jobs is also a recent characteristic. According to a survey by the Technical Personnel Association of San Francisco, in January of this year, the number of applications for employment submitted to the association by technical personnel reached twice the same period last year, but the number of job openings is said to be only half of last year. In Chicago, the number of salaried workers seeking employment at the state employment agency increased by 41% compared to last year. Due to this situation, the employment prospects of college students graduating in June are also bleak. Of the 250 companies that recruit personnel from the Harvard Business School, 49 companies recently suddenly announced the cancellation of recruitment.

The reporter said that, considering the overall situation, the United States has not yet reached the point where intellectuals are selling fruit by the roadside. But the economic recession is gradually beginning to threaten the lives of American citizens.

    美经济衰退更加显著
    失业者逾五百万
    两个城市出现了不吉之兆所谓“面包队”摆成长蛇阵
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：据共同社驻纽约特派记者3日报道，美国目前的经济衰退想像不到地深刻，失业人数也终于突破了五百万大关。
    记者说，今年2月初，在田纳西州孟菲斯和俄亥俄州劳伦两个城市都出现了领取市当局的救济粮食的队伍——“面包队”，这给予长时期以来“夸耀繁荣”的美国人以“很大的震动”。面包队在1955年初到处都可以看到，但是，以后很久看不到了。因此，美国人感到面包队是“不吉祥的征兆”。
    记者说，现在你如果走在纽约的街道上，你就会感觉到“出租办公室”和“出租商店”等牌子增加很多，廉价出售电视机、电气洗衣机、电气除尘器等家庭电气设备的广告也非常显眼。美国家庭主妇现在最大的烦恼是物价上涨，特别是在日常生活中不可缺少的粮食和房租的上涨，似乎使不论哪一家主妇都唉声叹气。“经济虽然衰退，但是物价仍在上涨”——这是美国市面上最近的特点。
    薪金生活者的失业逐渐增多的现象也是最近的特点。据旧金山的技术人员协会调查，今年1月，技术人员向协会提出要求就业的申请达到去年同一时期的两倍，但是，招聘方面据说只有去年的一半。在芝加哥，到州立职业介绍所要求就业的薪金生活者人数比去年增加41％。由于这种情况，将在6月毕业的大学生的就业前途也很暗淡。向哈佛大学商学院征聘人员的二百五十家公司中，有四十九家公司最近突然宣布取消征聘。
    记者说，从整个情况来看，美国现在还没有到达知识分子在路旁卖水果的局面。但是经济衰退正在开始逐步威胁美国市民的生活。
