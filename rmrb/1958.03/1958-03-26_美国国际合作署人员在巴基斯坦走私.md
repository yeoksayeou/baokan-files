Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 25th: "Star Evening News" recently revealed that personnel from the U.S. International Cooperation Administration, enjoying diplomatic privileges, have been successively selling large quantities of refrigerators to Pakistanis without paying import duties. The newspaper pointed out that these Americans can also convert the money they receive from selling refrigerators into pounds or dollars to take back with them, which has also caused losses to Pakistan's treasury in terms of foreign exchange.

    美国国际合作署人员在巴基斯坦走私
    据新华社卡拉奇25日电“明星晚报”最近揭露享有外交特权的美国国际合作署人员陆续向巴基斯坦人出售大批电冰箱，而不缴纳进口税。这家报纸指出，这些美国人还可以把他们出售冰箱后得到的钱换成英镑或美元带回去，这使巴基斯坦的国库在外汇方面也遭到了损失。
