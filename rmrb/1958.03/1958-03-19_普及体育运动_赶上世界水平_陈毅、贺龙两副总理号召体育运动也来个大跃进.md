Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The 1958 National Sports Work Conference was held in Beijing from February 25th to March 11th.

Two hundred and seventy leading cadres from provinces, cities, autonomous regions, sports academies, and the National Defense Sports Association attended the meeting. The conference fully discussed and studied the "Ten-Year Development Program for Physical Education" proposed by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.

The program pointed out that in order to better serve socialist construction through sports, it is necessary to implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, building the country diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. It is essential to vigorously promote mass sports activities and, on the basis of the widespread development of sports, accelerate the improvement of sports standards, striving to catch up with world standards in major sports in about ten years.

The "Ten-Year Development Program for Physical Education" consists of thirty articles. The program requires that within ten years, 40 million people pass the Labor and Defense System standards, 8 million people (including national defense sports projects) reach the standard of graded athletes, and 5,000 master athletes emerge. In terms of national defense sports, it requires 30 million people to participate in various activities within ten years, cultivating 2.9 million graded athletes and 110,000 graded referees.

During the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the State Council, delivered an important speech. He first expressed his satisfaction with the conference and agreed with and supported the development targets put forward in the "Ten-Year Development Program for Physical Education." He said that the target of 40 million people passing the Labor and Defense System standards, 8 million people reaching the standard of graded athletes, and the emergence of 5,000 master athletes within ten years is entirely achievable. He called on sports workers to resolutely oppose waste, oppose conservatism, unite experts, closely integrate leadership with the masses, and create an "atomic explosion" and a Great Leap Forward in sports.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that in order to rapidly improve sports performance and catch up with the world's advanced levels, it is necessary to more widely popularize mass sports. If improvement is used to oppose popularization, this is opposing the mass line in sports. The consequence of this will inevitably lead to relying solely on a few "champions" and will inevitably foster the idea of championism, which is bourgeois sports ideology, not Marxist-Leninist sports ideology. He said that our popularization and improvement are consistent; popularization provides the foundation for improvement; and improvement, in turn, serves popularization and promotes its progress. On the basis of popularizing mass sports, sports performance will inevitably improve. Only when thousands of people participate in sports can more national and world records emerge. We do not deny the role of improvement, that is, to break old records and strive for new records, which will further promote popularization. When talking about how to popularize sports, he said that sports is a science, so it is necessary to popularize sports according to sports science and technology; various sports exercises should be carried out according to local conditions and the conditions of the human body. All work should be based on mobilizing voluntary participation and the cooperation of various units and departments, so that it can proceed smoothly and successfully.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also pointed out that to underestimate sports and be uneasy about sports work is a wrong idea; some people think that labor can replace sports, which is also an incorrect idea. He said that labor and sports are two different things, which cannot be confused or replaced with each other. People can relax their minds and bodies and restore fatigue after participating in certain sports exercises after labor, so that all parts of the body can develop normally. Sports greatly helps to improve labor production, which is a valuable experience in several years of sports and is worth publicizing and introducing. He encouraged all the delegates present to be energetic and resolutely bring sports to the broad masses, so that our people become sound in mind, strong in physique, tall in stature, and upright in posture, and do more and more arduous work in the socialist construction of the motherland.

Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission He Long left Beijing on official business, and he gave written instructions to the meeting. He said that now the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and socialist construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds. Sports must also strive to catch up with world standards in major sports in about ten years in accordance with the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, in order to adapt to the development of the situation.

Vice Premier He Long pointed out that developing mass sports is the basic policy of our country's sports work, which cannot be shaken, but the emphasis should be on the work according to the specific situation. The First National Games of the People's Republic of China, which will be held next year, is a major event and should be held well. He demanded that: First, there must be a batch of new records, and second, there must be a batch of new talents. Not one or two, three or five, but a large number. The cultivation of athletes should be more selective. China has a large population and great potential. As long as the masses are mobilized, there will definitely be talent.

Vice Premier He Long also said that sports workers should regard sports as a lifelong career, which is a major event related to the vital interests of 600 million people and the future of the country and the nation. He demanded that all sports workers seriously rectify their work style, participate in labor, transform themselves, and eliminate "five airs."

Vice Premier He Long finally pointed out that the National Defense Sports Association has also done a lot of work in recent years. The cause has developed, and the masses are very welcome. He demanded that all undertakings of national defense sports must also formulate specific plans in accordance with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and the principle of running affairs diligently and thriftily, rely on the masses, and do a good job.

    普及体育运动　赶上世界水平
    陈毅、贺龙两副总理号召体育运动也来个大跃进
    新华社18日讯　1958年全国体育工作会议2月25日到3月11日在北京举行。
    到会的二百七十名来自全国各省、市、自治区，各体育学院和国防体育协会的负责干部。会议充分讨论和研究了体育运动委员会提出的“体育运动十年发展纲要”。
    这个纲要指出：为了使体育事业更好地为社会主义建设服务，必须贯彻多快好省、勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针；要大力开展群众性体育运动，在体育运动广泛开展的基础上，加速提高运动水平，争取十年左右在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平。
    “体育运动十年发展纲要”共三十条。纲要要求十年内有四千万人通过劳卫制，八百万人（包括国防体育项目）达到等级运动员标准，并且出现运动健将五千名。在国防体育方面，十年内要求有三千万人参加各项活动，培养等级运动员两百九十万人，等级裁判员十一万人。
    会议期间，陈毅副总理代表国务院到会作了重要指示。他首先对这次会议表示满意；对“体育运动十年发展纲要”提出的发展指标表示同意和支持。他说，十年内要求有四千万人通过劳卫制、八百万人达到等级运动员标准和出现五千个运动健将，这个指标是完全可以达到的。他号召体育工作者要坚决地反对浪费、反对保守、团结专家、领导同群众紧密地结合起来，在体育运动上也来一个“原子爆炸”和大跃进。
    陈毅副总理指出，为了迅速提高运动成绩，赶上世界先进水平，就必须更广泛地普及群众体育运动。假如用提高来反对普及，这就是反对体育运动走群众路线。这样的后果必然会导致只靠几个“冠军”吃饭，必然会助长锦标主义思想的产生，这是资产阶级的体育思想，不是马列主义的体育思想。他说，我们的普及和提高是一致的，普及为提高提供了基础；而提高掉转来为普及服务，推动普及的进行。在普及群众体育运动的基础上，必然会提高运动成绩。只有千千万万的人都投入了体育运动，才能有更多的全国纪录和世界纪录出现。我们毫不否认提高的作用，即是说要打破旧纪录争取新纪录，这样更多推动普及工作。在谈到如何普及的问题时，他说，体育是一门科学，因此必须要按照体育的科学技术去普及体育运动；要依照当地的条件和人体的条件去进行各项体育锻炼。一切工作放在发动自愿参加与各单位各部门协作配合上去进行，这样一定能顺利成功。
    陈毅副总理还指出，轻视体育和不安心于体育工作，是一种错误的思想；有人以为劳动可以代替体育的说法也是一种不正确的想法。他说，劳动和体育是两回事，彼此不能混淆和相互代替。人们在劳动之后参加一定的体育锻炼，可以舒展身心，恢复疲劳，使身体各个部分都能得到正常的发展。体育运动大大有助于提高劳动生产，这是几年体育运动中的宝贵经验，值得宣传和介绍。他鼓励到会的全体代表要鼓起干劲，坚决把体育运动带到广大群众中去，使我国人民变得思想健全，体质健壮，身体高大，姿势端正，在祖国社会主义建设事业中做更多、更艰巨的工作。
    国务院副总理、体育运动委员会主任贺龙因公离开北京，他对会议作了书面指示。他说，现在世界上东风压倒了西风，社会主义各项建设事业都在大踏步地向前跃进。体育运动也必须根据党中央和毛主席提出的多快好省的方针，争取十年左右在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平，才能适应形势发展。
    贺龙副总理指出，开展群众性的体育运动是我国体育工作的基本方针，不能动摇，但要根据具体情况在工作上有所侧重。将在明年举行的第一届中国人民体育运动大会是一件大事，要开得好。他要求：第一要有一批新纪录，第二要有一批新人材。不是一个两个、三个五个，而是一大批。培养运动员要多里求精。中国人多，潜力很大，只要发动群众，一定有人才。
    贺龙副总理还说，体育工作者要把体育当作终身事业，这是有关六亿人民切身利益和国家民族前途的大事。他要求所有的体育工作者都要认真整风，参加劳动，改造自己，打掉“五气”。
    贺龙副总理最后指出，几年来国防体育协会也做了很多工作，事业有发展，群众很欢迎。他要求国防体育的各项事业，也必须根据跃进的精神和勤俭办事的原则，订出具体规划，依靠群众，做好工作。
