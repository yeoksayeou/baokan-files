Editorial Notes:

    As spring deepens, more good news about afforestation arrives. Yuexi County in Anhui Province has completed a journey of ten years in just forty-five days, achieving complete afforestation throughout the county. This is one of the three counties, along with Sinan in Guizhou and the Miao Autonomous County of D苗 Mountain in Guangxi, to achieve complete afforestation.
    In the afforestation movement, Yuexi County conducted a major ideological debate, eliminating all kinds of right-leaning conservative thoughts in the afforestation work, and increasing the originally planned afforestation plan several times. More than half of the county's population was mobilized to carry out a concentrated afforestation effort. This greatly accelerated the speed of afforestation. Yesterday, this newspaper reported on Shaanxi Province's campaign to "plant a liter of walnuts per household," and Shanxi Province's decision to plant 120 million walnut trees in one year, exceeding the ten-year development plan for walnuts. The goals of these places for afforestation work are clear, the plans are grand, and the enthusiasm is full, which is worthy of everyone's emulation.
    Taking advantage of this fine weather, it is hoped that a new high tide of large-scale greening of the motherland will be set off in various places.

    向岳西人民致贺
    春色日浓，又传来绿化喜讯。安徽省岳西县只用四十五天的时间，就走完十年的路程，全县实现了绿化。这是和贵州思南、广西大苗山苗族自治县同时出现的三个绿化县之一。
    岳西县在绿化运动中，进行了思想大辩论，扫除了造林工作中的各种各样的右倾保守思想，把原订的造林计划翻了几番。全县一半以上的人口都发动起来，突击造林。这样就大大加快了绿化的速度。昨日本报报道了陕西省开展“每户种一升核桃”运动，山西省决定以今年一年时间种核桃树一亿二千万株，超额完成十年发展核桃的规划。这些地方造林工作的目标明确，计划宏伟，干劲十足，值得大家效法。
    趁这风和日暖的大好时光，希望各地掀起一个大规模的绿化祖国的新高潮。
