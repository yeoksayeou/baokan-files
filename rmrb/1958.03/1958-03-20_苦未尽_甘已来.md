The most popular slogan across the country right now is "Hard Work." We work hard here for three years, and work hard there for three months. The face of the motherland is changing day by day, and, without realizing it, "sweetness" is slowly arriving along with it. Today, the Ministry of Commerce has decided to lower the prices of some medicines, radios, alarm clocks, and fluorescent lights, which is a spring flower carrying a sweet taste.

How lovable is our motherland! We work and labor diligently for her, completely disregarding ourselves. However, she never forgets her children. Every bit you dedicate to her, she returns to you without holding anything back. Now, the three years of "hard" work have just begun, and "sweetness" has already started to arrive. Let us unite as one and continue to work hard! "Sweetness" will flow in an endless stream.

    苦未尽　甘已来
    现在全国流行最广的口号是“苦干”。这里苦干三年，那里苦干三月，祖国的面貌一天天在变化，不知不觉地，“甘”也慢慢地随着来了。今天第一商业部决定降低一些药品、收音机、闹钟、日光灯的价格，就是带着甘味的一朵春花。
    我们的祖国，有多么可爱！我们全然不顾自己，辛勤地为她劳动，为她工作。但是，她却从来不忘记自己的儿女，你献给她的每一分，她都丝毫不留地还赐给你。现在三年的“苦”干刚刚开始，“甘”已经就开始来了。让我们万众一心，继续苦干下去吧！“甘”将会源源而来。
