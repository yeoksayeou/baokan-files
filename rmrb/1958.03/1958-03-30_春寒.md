    Spring sunshine, bright and lovely, is indeed endlessly pleasing. However, a fly in the ointment is the fickle spring weather: sometimes rain in the south, sometimes snow in the northeast, and often sandstorms and yellow dust obscuring the sky in North China. With the onslaught of northerly winds of force six or higher, temperatures plummet, immediately creating the phenomenon of "spring cold."

    How is "spring cold" caused?

    Simply put, it is caused by a large-scale southward invasion of cold, dry air from the north. When this cold air arrives, it often causes the temperature in a locality to plummet by a dozen or even more than twenty degrees Celsius within a day and night.

    Why is there still a "cold wave" in spring?

    "Cold waves" can erupt in any season. It's just that in high summer and early autumn, when the weather is hot, the "cold wave" itself increases in temperature and becomes warmer after it arrives, and its "ferocity" disappears. In the dead of winter, the mainland is icy cold, making it the season for its triumphant prevalence. Therefore, it is most active then. However, when the spring sunshine is bright and the flowers are blooming, "cold waves" are still very active, accounting for 30% of the annual total.

    Extremely cold and dry air stagnates over the frigid mainland of northern China. Cold air is heavy with dryness and coldness, contracts and sinks, accumulating more and more. The longer the time, the more the accumulation, and the greater the air pressure. Thus, a vast high-pressure area is formed. Conversely, the further south one goes, the warmer the weather, the air expands when heated, rises to high altitudes and dissipates, and the pressure becomes lower and lower, thus forming a low-pressure area. When the north-south pressure difference reaches a certain limit, the air in the high-pressure area begins to flow towards the low-pressure area. This flow becomes wind. The violent northerly winds that often occur during "spring cold" are formed in this way.

    When air flows southward, the warm air that was originally resting on the ground is swept away. Pursued by the cold air, part of the warm air "flees" south, and most of it "hides" in the high altitudes. However, the higher one goes, the colder it gets. And the ability of air to hold water vapor decreases with decreasing temperature, so excess water vapor at high altitudes condenses into rain and snow. Spring showers and "peach blossom snow" are formed in this way.

    When "spring cold" arrives, the temperature is often very low. As the saying goes, "A return to cold in spring freezes the muscles and bones." Frost is often accompanied by "spring cold."

    Each time "spring cold" occurs, the weather turns warm again after two or three days. But at the same time, air pressure is also undergoing "polarization" between the north and south, breeding the next arrival of "spring cold." Generally, in early spring, a "cold wave" strikes southward about every ten days, and in late spring, about every half a month, the weather undergoes drastic changes. Spring weather is characterized by alternating winds, rain, overcast skies, sunshine, cold, and warmth, making it unpredictable. As the saying goes, "A spring day is like a child's face, changing three times a day," which is the reason. This sudden change from hot to cold is most conducive to the breeding of germs. Some common diseases like colds are most likely to occur at this time. We must pay more attention.

    春寒

    明媚可爱的春光，确实令人百赏不厌。但是，美中不足的是春日气候多变：时而江南落雨，时而东北飘雪，华北地区则经常风沙弥漫，黄尘遮天。随着六级以上偏北风的吹袭，温度暴降，立即造成了春寒的现象。
    “春寒”是怎样造成的呢？
    简单地说，就是北方寒冷干燥的空气，大规模向南侵袭时所造成的。当这股冷空气到来时，常使一地气温在一昼夜内暴降十几度甚至二十度以上。
    为什么春天还有“寒潮”呢？
    “寒潮”暴发，四季都有。只不过是盛夏初秋，天气炎热，当它到来之后，本身温度增高变暖，“威风”早已消失掉了。隆冬腊月，大陆冰冷，就成为它得意盛行的季节。所以，活动的次数最多，但是，当春光明媚，百花盛开的时候，“寒潮”却仍很活跃。占到全年的30％。
    我国北方严寒的大陆上，停滞着十分干冷的空气。冷空气干寒量重，收缩下沉，愈来愈多地堆积起来。时间越长，停积越多，空气压力就越大。于是就形成了一个广大的高气压区。与此相反，愈往南去，天气愈暖，空气受热膨胀，上升到高处跑掉了，压力就越变越低，于是，形成了一个低气压区。当南北气压差别达到一定限度时，高气压区域的空气就开始向低气压区域流动。这一流动就成了风。“春寒”时经常出现狂暴的偏北风，就是这样形成的。
    当空气向南流动的时候，所到之处，原先停留在地面上的暖空气，就被一扫而光。在冷空气的追逐之下，暖空气一部分向南“逃跑”，大部分到高空“躲避”。但是，愈往高处，愈是寒冷。而空气所能容纳水蒸汽的能力，是随着温度的减低而变小的，因此高处多余的水蒸汽就凝成雨雪。春季的阵雨和“桃花雪”都是这样形成的。
    “春寒”到来时，气温往往很低。俗话说：“反了春，冻动筋”。伴随“春寒”到来的常会有霜冻。
    每次“春寒”，经二、三日天气便又转暖。但同时南北两地，气压也在发生着“两极分化”，孕育着下次“春寒”的到来。大致初春时十日左右，暮春时半月前后，“寒潮”南袭一次，天气就随着发生剧烈的变化。春季天气，风、雨、阴、晴、寒、暖交替，变化不定，谚语：“春天孩儿面，一日三朝变”，就是这个道理。这种忽冷忽热的变化，最利于病菌的繁殖。一些像感冒之类的流行疾病，在这个时候最易发生。我们必须多加注意。
