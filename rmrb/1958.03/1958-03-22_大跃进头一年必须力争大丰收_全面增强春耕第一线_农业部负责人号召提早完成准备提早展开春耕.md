Xinhua News Agency, March 21st -- The first spring ploughing of the Great Leap Forward has arrived. A person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture made a statement to reporters saying: Grasping and checking all the preparatory work for spring ploughing, and striving to complete preparations early and start spring ploughing early, are decisive keys to striving for a bumper harvest in 1958.

The person in charge said: This year is the first year of the Great Leap Forward and we must lay a good foundation for the future. This year, we must strive for not just an ordinary harvest, but a bumper harvest. Every step and every link of production must be grasped tightly. The current spring ploughing is particularly important because it relates to the harvest for the whole year.

	Step by step, wave after wave
	Firmly grasp every measure to increase production

The conditions for spring ploughing and production this year are better than in any previous year, and spring ploughing and production work should also be done better than in any previous year. The production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation last winter and this spring has yielded great results. The area of paddy fields and irrigated land across the country has jumped from more than 500 million mu to more than 700 million mu. The national fertilizer accumulation has broken all previous records, reaching 140.3 billion dan, averaging 7,000 jin per mu of cultivated land nationwide. In five provinces, fertilizer application this year can reach more than 10,000 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 20,000 jin. Due to the development of pig raising and the universal attention paid to fertilizer processing by agricultural cooperatives, the quality of fertilizer is also better than in previous years. In addition, unprecedented achievements have also been made in soil improvement, management of waterlogged land, and soil and water conservation in mountainous areas. The current question is: how to better and continuously adopt various specific and effective measures to utilize these extremely advantageous conditions to realize this year's great leap in production.

The person in charge said: The important issue is production leadership. This year's production leadership must be grasped step by step, wave after wave, without any relaxation. In each season, we must promote practical and reliable measures to increase production according to different crops and local conditions. Otherwise, if one link cannot keep up, it will affect the whole year. Therefore, leadership must be specific, and every key, every crop, and every specific measure must be grasped well. Leadership must be timely, grasping the season and the opportunity, ensuring that no farming season is missed, and working through one upsurge after another. Leadership cannot only have general accounts without detailed accounts, only plans without measures, only deployments without inspections. We must ensure that the specific requirements of each period and each aspect of production this year are fulfilled to achieve the goal of the Great Leap Forward. This requires all localities to concentrate their efforts and strengthen guidance on the front lines of production. Recently, the Party and government agricultural departments in Shandong Province have concentrated their forces and divided them into four fronts: grain, cotton, etc., to strengthen production leadership on the front lines. Hubei Province recently organized technical reporting groups, production inspection groups, and cotton planting technical guidance groups to tour various places to provide specific guidance, focusing on grasping five aspects of cotton production: water conservancy, fertilizer, close planting, weeding, and pest control. Some places in Henan Province recently put forward the requirements of "six checks and six comparisons" for cotton planting. Hebei Province recently convened a meeting in Anguo to strengthen the field management of wheat. These are all very good measures to strengthen specific leadership over production, and it is hoped that all localities will pay attention to them and always pay attention to discovering and promoting advanced experiences.

	Do a good job in field management of summer crops
	Political work is the driving force to promote the high tide

Currently, it is also important to grasp the field management of summer crops, especially wheat and rapeseed. We must strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops to fire the first shot and lay the foundation for a bumper harvest for the whole year. At present, wheat seedlings are generally growing well, but the poorly growing third-class seedlings account for about 10% to 15%, which is a serious problem. We must take irrigation and topdressing measures to eliminate third-class seedlings in order to increase wheat production. Now the wheat seedlings in various places are returning to green, and we must seize the time to apply fertilizer. All those with poor soil moisture must immediately organize irrigation to revive the green water. The requirements for irrigating the jointing water and the grouting water in the future must also be effectively met. In the southern wheat fields and rapeseed fields, we should promptly do a good job in clearing ditches and draining water.

There are still many urgent problems to be solved in the current spring ploughing. In addition to water conservancy and fertilizer, rationally organizing labor to improve efficiency, breeding draft animals, replenishing farm tools, improving farm tools, and technical guidance are all very urgent. It is hoped that all localities will promptly grasp and solve them. There must also be special measures to increase the production of major grain crops and cotton. This year, the planting area of rice and sweet potatoes has been greatly expanded, and the preparatory work in the newly expanded areas must be grasped particularly tightly. The newly developed rice areas urgently need to organize labor to build ridges, soak fields, and solve the problems of seeds and seedling raising.

How well the agricultural cooperative's management and labor organization, as well as the political work in production, are done is closely related to the realization of this year's great leap in production. The former is the organizational guarantee, and the latter is the ideological driving force to make the production upsurge continue to develop. Therefore, the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture requires all localities to attach importance to these two tasks.

Finally, the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture said: Except for the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, due to the scarcity of rain and snow last winter and this spring, the soil moisture is poor in most areas of North China and Northwest China, and the rainfall is also insufficient in some areas south of the Yangtze River. At present, all localities urgently need to organize a soil moisture survey and water conservation. If the soil moisture is poor, they should immediately organize spring irrigation and strictly prevent spring drought from affecting spring sowing.

    大跃进头一年必须力争大丰收
    全面增强春耕第一线
    农业部负责人号召提早完成准备提早展开春耕
    新华社21日讯　农业生产大跃进的第一个春耕就到了，农业部负责人向记者发表谈话说：抓紧作好并检查春耕的一切准备工作，争取提早完成准备和提早开始春耕，是争取1958年大丰收的决定性的关键。
    负责人说：今年是大跃进的头一年，必须为今后打好基础。今年要争取的不是一般的丰收而是大丰收，生产的每一步、每一个环节都必须抓得很紧。当前春耕关系全年的收成，尤为重要。
    一步紧一步，一浪赶一浪
    紧紧抓住每一项增产措施
    今年春耕生产的条件比以往任何一年都好，春耕生产工作也应该作得比以往任何一年好。去冬今春以兴修水利和积肥为中心的生产高潮成绩巨大，全国水田和水浇地的面积已由五亿多亩一跃而为七亿多亩。全国积肥数量打破了空前的纪录达一千四百零三亿担，以全国耕地平均每亩达七千斤。有五个省今年每亩施肥可达万斤以上，最高的达两万斤。由于养猪的发展和农业社普遍注意了对肥料的加工，肥料质量也比往年好。此外，改良土壤、治理涝洼地和山区水土保持等工作也都取得了空前的成绩。当前的问题是：如何更好地不间断地采取各项具体而有力的措施利用这些极为优越的条件，来实现今年生产大跃进。
    负责人说：重要的问题是生产的领导工作。今年的生产领导必须一步紧一步、一浪赶一浪地抓下去，不能有一刻放松；在每个季节，都要根据不同的作物，因时因地地推行切实可靠的增产措施，否则，一个环节赶不上去，就要影响全年。因此，领导必须具体，对每一关键、每一作物、每一具体措施都必须抓好。领导要及时，抓季节、抓时机，作到不误农时，一个高潮又一个高潮地干下去。领导上不能只有大账没有细账，只有规划没有措施，只有布置没有检查。必须把今年生产上每一时期每一方面的具体要求都切实作到，才能实现大跃进的目标。这就要求各地集中力量，加强生产第一线的指导。最近山东省党和政府的农业部门，已经集中力量分了粮食、棉花等四条战线，分别加强了第一线的生产领导。湖北省最近组织了技术报告团、生产检查团、植棉技术指导团巡回各地作具体指导，对棉花生产着重抓紧水利、肥料、密植、除草和治虫五个方面。河南省有些地方最近对植棉提出了六查六比的要求。河北省最近在安国召开了加强小麦田间管理的会议。这些都是加强对生产具体领导的很好的措施，希望各地注意，并随时注意发现和推广先进经验。
    要做好夏熟作物的田间管理
    政治工作是促进高潮的动力
    当前抓夏熟作物特别是小麦和油菜的田间管理工作也很重要。必须力争夏熟大丰收来打响第一炮，为全年丰收打个基础。现在麦苗一般生长较好，但生长不好的三类苗约占10％—15％，这是一个严重问题，必须采取灌溉追肥措施消灭三类苗，小麦才能增产。现在各地麦苗正在返青，要抓紧追施肥料，凡是墒情不好的都要立即组织灌返青水。今后浇拔节水、灌浆水的要求也须切实作到；南方麦田及油菜田则应及时作好清沟排水工作。
    当前春耕急待解决的问题还很多，除水利肥料外，合理组织劳动力来提高效率，繁殖耕畜，补充农具，改良农具，技术指导等等都是很迫切的，希望各地及时抓紧解决。对主要粮食作物和棉花的增产也须有专门的措施。今年水稻和薯类的种植面积扩大很多，新扩大地区的准备工作尤须抓紧。新发展水稻地区急须组织劳动力打埂泡田和解决种子及育秧问题。
    农业社的经营管理和劳动组织以及生产中的政治工作做得如何，和实现今年生产大跃进的关系很大，前者是组织保证，后者是使生产高潮持续发展下去的思想动力，因此，农业部负责人要求各地必须重视这两项工作。
    最后，农业部负责人说：除东北和内蒙古外，由于去冬今春雨雪稀少，华北和西北大部地区墒情不好，长江以南部分地区雨量也不足。目前各地急须组织一次查墒和保墒，墒情不好立即组织春灌，严防春旱影响春播。
