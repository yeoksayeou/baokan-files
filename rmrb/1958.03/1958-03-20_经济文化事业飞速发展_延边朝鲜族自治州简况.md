    Rapid Development of Economic and Cultural Undertakings
    A Brief Introduction to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture
    The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province was established on September 3, 1952. It is located in the southeastern part of Jilin Province, bordering the Soviet Union's Primorsky Krai to the east, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the south, Changbai, Fusong, and Dunhua counties to the west, and Ning'an, Muling, and Dongning counties in Heilongjiang Province to the north. The total area of the prefecture is 29,991 square kilometers, with a total population of 795,106, of which 560,872 are of Korean ethnicity, accounting for 70.5% of the total population. The Han ethnicity accounts for 27.6% of the total population, with other minority ethnic groups such as Manchu and Hui also present. The autonomous prefecture administers five counties: Yanji, Wangqing, Hunchun, Helong, and Antu, as well as Yanji City. The counties and cities have eleven towns and one hundred and twenty-four townships. The People's Committee of the Autonomous Prefecture is stationed in Yanji City.
    The topography of the autonomous prefecture consists of mountains, hills, and river valley plains, with mountains covering the largest area. High mountains are mostly distributed in the border areas, with river valley plains scattered in the central part. Cultivated land in the autonomous prefecture accounts for only 6.2% of the total area, with the rest being forests or land suitable for afforestation.
    The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce in the autonomous prefecture was basically completed in 1956. Currently, 97.3% of peasant households in the prefecture participate in agricultural production cooperatives, 96% of handicraft workers have joined handicraft production cooperatives, and all private industrial and commercial enterprises have been transformed into joint state-private ownership.
    In order to develop agricultural production, the autonomous prefecture has established one agricultural experiment station, one meteorological station, one hydrological station, one tractor station, and one plant protection and quarantine station, forty-eight agricultural technology extension stations, sixteen animal husbandry and veterinary work stations, and eighteen local state-owned farms.
    Water conservancy construction is the primary measure for increasing grain production in the autonomous prefecture. The area of paddy fields in the prefecture has now reached more than 45,000 hectares, an expansion of more than 1.2 times compared to pre-liberation levels. The area of fertilizer application has increased from 32% of the total cultivated land area in 1950 to about 45%. A total of 3,084 new-style farm implements have been promoted. As a result of the above-mentioned effective measures, the total grain output and yield per unit area in the autonomous prefecture have exceeded the highest production levels before liberation in 1950. At the same time, special crops such as flue-cured tobacco and flax have been actively developed, and the area of fruit tree cultivation has expanded to 3.95 times its original area in 1952.
    In terms of animal husbandry, according to the 1956 statistics, the total number of large livestock increased by 7.1% compared to pre-liberation levels. The number of pigs has reached 140,582, more than double the pre-liberation number, and exceeded the original planned target for this year by 4.3%.
    Forestry occupies an important position in the autonomous prefecture. From 1952 to 1956, a total of 23,876 hectares of forests were planted.
    Large-scale state-owned factories and mines located in the autonomous prefecture include two paper mills, two forestry bureaus, a copper-lead mine, a coal mine, a power plant, a flax raw material factory, and a lumber mill. There are 102 local state-owned factories and mines, producing more than 500 varieties of products in light industry and the food industry alone. The total number of factory and mine workers reaches more than 70,000. The total industrial output value accounts for 79.02% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the autonomous prefecture.
    The transportation industry in the autonomous prefecture is quite developed, with four railway trunk and branch lines and fifteen highways. At present, all counties, cities, and major towns in the prefecture are accessible by automobile.
    In terms of culture, education, and health, the autonomous prefecture has seven high schools and complete middle schools (including six Korean schools), with 5,253 students; thirty-two junior middle schools (including twenty-five Korean schools), with 21,078 students; and three hundred and thirty-nine primary schools (including two hundred and fifty-five Korean schools), with 107,555 students. The enrollment rate of school-age children has reached 96.2% for the Korean ethnicity and 91% for the Han ethnicity. In order to meet the needs of economic and cultural development, there are also one secondary normal school, one agricultural technology school, one health school, one art school, and one Chinese language training school. In addition, there is also a comprehensive university—Yanbian University—with three colleges: normal, medical, and agricultural, with a total of more than 1,580 students. 95% of the students in the school are children of workers and peasants. The spare-time cultural education of workers and peasants is also quite developed, with a total of more than 100,000 workers and peasants participating in learning.
    The autonomous prefecture has fifteen hospitals, one hundred and thirty-two health clinics and independent outpatient departments, and thirty-four joint traditional Chinese medicine clinics. In order to prevent and control special diseases, there are one health and epidemic prevention station, one endemic disease prevention and control institute, one tuberculosis prevention and treatment hospital, and one mental sanatorium. In addition, there are also fifty-three maternal and child health stations and five hundred and eighty-one midwifery stations. More than 1,300 kindergartens and seasonal nurseries have been established in rural areas. (Attached picture)
