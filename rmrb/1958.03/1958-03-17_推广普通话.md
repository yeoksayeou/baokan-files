Promote Putonghua
	Yú Jìn

Dialects arise because people are in a state of mutual isolation. After the economy begins to develop and the state of isolation begins to be eliminated, dialects continue to exist, becoming an obstacle that both parties in a face-to-face conversation are trying hard to eliminate, but is difficult to eliminate. At this time, a unified national language is required by reality. Lu Xun described this need in modern China in "A Little Something About Writing": "Now, at the docks, in public institutions, and in universities, there is indeed something that resembles Putonghua. When people speak, it is neither 'National Language' (Guóyǔ) nor Beijing dialect; everyone carries their own regional accent and tone, but it is not a dialect. Even if it is difficult to say and difficult to understand, it can still be said and understood." However, a unified national language is ultimately not a fusion of various dialects, but can only develop from one of the dialects that is more easily accepted by people. What Lu Xun called "something that resembles Putonghua" is, in fact, Putonghua with regional accents and tones, which shows that people are working hard to find a common language in order to understand each other.

The formation of a unified national language depends on the development of the common economic life of the people. Qin Shi Huang once unified Chinese characters by administrative order, which played a very important role in the history of the Chinese nation, but he did not unify the pronunciation of Chinese. In the early Ming Dynasty, after pacifying Yunnan and Guizhou, the Central Plains pronunciation was forcibly promoted among the local people, but the Central Plains pronunciation eventually took on local characteristics and became the dialects of the Yunnan-Guizhou region. These facts are sufficient to show that without extensive and frequent economic and cultural ties among all the people of the nation, a unified national language cannot be produced by relying on administrative power; on the other hand, it is also sufficient to show that under conditions of economic development, appropriate promotion by administrative power can have an effect on the development of language. Because Chinese characters were ultimately unified, and the dialects of the Yunnan-Guizhou region are easier to understand than other dialects, such as those of Guangdong and Fujian. The commonality of the economic life of the Chinese people in modern times has developed significantly, and there is a need for a unified national language among the people, but the country is not unified, and apart from the advocacy of a few scholars, there is a lack of conscious, unified, and effective guidance to promote the formation of a unified national language, so the barriers of dialects continue to exist in large quantities.

The victory of the People's Great Revolution has created an unprecedented unity in our country. Hundreds of millions of people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are engaged in a heated struggle for the common cause of building socialism. The more this struggle develops, the more the people need a unified national language to serve them. It is completely reasonable to adapt to this need by giving people guidance and taking all possible measures.

Of course, abandoning a habitual language and adopting another language is a difficult matter. Some people have already learned Putonghua and can use it skillfully, but they still use their local dialect when reading silently or thinking. Some people have spoken Putonghua for decades, but in their old age, they suddenly regress, indulging in speaking their local dialect, and taking pleasure in it. As for those who speak Putonghua without losing their regional accents and tones, it goes without saying. This also shows that the main target of promoting Putonghua should be teenagers and children. If the current teenagers and children are all trained to speak Putonghua, then, in the next half century, a unified national language will at least be basically formed. The difference between promoting Putonghua and not promoting it lies here.

The formation of a unified national language is the progress of our nation. Everyone should support the promotion of Putonghua.

    推广普通话
    于进
    方言因人们处于互相隔绝的状态而产生。在经济开始发达，隔绝状态开始消除以后，方言却继续存在着，成为面对面谈话的双方都极力想要消除然而很难消除的障碍。此时统一的民族语言便为事实所需要。鲁迅在“门外文谈”中描述现代中国的这个需要说：“现在在码头上，公共机关中，大学校里，确已有着一种好像普通话模样的东西，大家说话，既非‘国语’，又不是京话，各各带着乡音，乡调，却又不是方言，即使说的吃力，听的也吃力，然而总归说得出，听得懂。”但是统一的民族语言究竟不是各种方言的融合，而只能是由方言中较易为人们所接受的一种发展而成。鲁迅所说“好像普通话模样的东西”，事实上就是带有乡音乡调的普通话，它说明人们为了互相了解正在努力寻找共同语言。
    统一的民族语言的形成，决定于人民的共同经济生活的发展。秦始皇曾经用行政命令统一过汉字，在中国民族发展的历史上起过很重要的作用，但是他没有统一汉语的发音。明初平定云南、贵州，曾经在当地人民中强迫推行过中原音，但是中原音在这里终于带上地方特点，成为云贵区域的方言。这些事实都足以说明，没有全民族人民在经济上和文化上的广泛和经常的联系，依靠行政力量是不能产生统一的民族语言的；另一方面也足以说明，在经济发达的条件下，行政力量的适当的推动对于语言的发展是可以有作用的。因为汉字到底还是统一了，而云贵区域的方言也比其他方言，例如广东、福建的方言好懂一些。近代中国人民的经济生活的共同性有了显著的发展，在人民中有了统一的民族语言的需要，但是国家是不统一的，除了少数学者的提倡以外，缺乏自觉的、统一的、有效的指导，来促进统一的民族语言的形成，所以方言的障碍继续大量存在着。
    人民大革命的胜利造成了我们国家的从古未有的统一，亿万人民在共产党领导下为了建设社会主义的共同事业进行着火热的斗争。这个斗争愈发展，人民便愈益需要有统一的民族语言来为他们服务。适应这个需要而给予人们以指导，并采取各种可能的措施是完全合理的。
    当然，放弃习用的语言，采取另一种语言，是一件困难的事情。有的人已经学会普通话，并且能够熟练地运用它，但是在默读或思考时用的却仍旧是家乡的土话。有的人讲了几十年普通话，到了老年，忽然倒退回去，醉心于说土话，并且以此为乐。至于讲普通话而不脱乡音乡调的人就更不用说了。即此也就可见推广普通话的对象主要应当是青少年和儿童。假如现在的青少年和儿童都受说普通话的训练，那么，在今后半个世纪中，统一的民族语言至少已经基本上形成了。推广普通话或不推广的区别就在这里。
    统一的民族语言的形成是我们民族的进步。一切的人应当拥护推广普通话。
