Cotton Production Leap Forward Target:
　　35 Million Dan
　　107 Counties to Become 100-Jin Ginned Cotton Counties This Year
　　(Our Dispatch) Farmers in cotton-growing areas and relevant departments nationwide are taking various effective measures to strive for a great leap forward in cotton production this year.
　　According to the 1958 national cotton production plan, the planting area will be 90.3 million mu, an increase of 4.12 million mu compared to 1957; the total output of ginned cotton will be 35 million dan, an increase of 2.2 million dan compared to 1957.
　　In order to achieve a great leap forward in cotton production in 1958, cotton-producing areas are vigorously building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer accumulation, improving soil, preparing improved varieties, and imparting technology. As of now, major cotton-producing provinces have proposed: In 1958, the area of cotton fields organized for a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu will reach more than 15 million mu nationwide, an increase of two and a half times compared to the area already achieved in 1957; in twelve cotton-producing provinces, 107 counties and cities have proposed to strive to achieve 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1958, equivalent to more than twenty-one times the five 100-jin ginned cotton counties already achieved in 1957.
　　In order to support the great leap forward in cotton production and greatly increase cotton yield per unit area, the state has prepared to allocate an additional 200,000 tons of nitrogenous chemical fertilizer to cotton-growing areas and conduct cotton yield-increasing experiments by applying chemical fertilizer to more than 16 million mu of high-yield and stable-yield cotton fields in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hubei, and other provinces. This year, the country will continue to promote and replace more than 16 million mu of improved cotton varieties, of which Dai-character cotton varieties will be further expanded by more than 13 million mu. Together with the existing Dai-character cotton variety area, it will reach more than 47 million mu, accounting for more than half of the total cotton field area. Pesticides and machinery for preventing and controlling pests and diseases will also be supplied in large quantities, fully and in a timely manner. The area of demonstration zones for large-scale and thorough prevention and control of cotton pests will be expanded from more than 2 million mu last year to a planned 28 million mu.

    棉花生产跃进指标
    三千五百万担
    107县将在今年成为百斤皮棉县
    本报讯　全国棉区农民和各有关部门正在采取各种有效措施，争取实现今年棉花生产大跃进。
    根据1958年全国棉花生产计划的安排，播种面积为九千零三十万亩，比1957年增加四百一十二万亩；皮棉总产量三千五百万担，比1957年增加二百二十万担。
    各产棉区为了实现1958年棉花生产大跃进，都在大力兴修水利、增积肥料、改良土壤，准备良种和传授技术。截至现在止，各主要产棉省已提出：1958年组织亩产百斤皮棉的棉田面积，全国共达一千五百多万亩，比1957年已经实现的棉田亩数增加两倍半；在十二个产棉省内，已有一百零七个县、市提出了要在1958年争取达到亩产百斤皮棉县，相当于1957年已经实现的五个百斤皮棉县的二十一倍多。
    为了支援棉花生产大跃进，大力提高棉花单位面积产量，国家已准备增拨给棉区氮素化学肥料二十万吨，在河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、湖北等省一千六百多万亩高产保收的棉田上进行增施化肥增产棉花试验。今年全国将继续推广和更换棉花良种一千六百多万亩，其中岱字棉良种将再扩大一千三百多万亩，连同已有的岱字棉良种面积将达到四千七百多万亩，占到总棉田面积的半数以上。防治病虫害的药械也可大量充分及时供应，大面积彻底防治棉花虫害示范区的面积，由去年的二百多万亩，计划扩大到二千八百多万亩。
