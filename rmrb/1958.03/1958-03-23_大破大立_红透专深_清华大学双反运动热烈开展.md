Great Destruction, Great Establishment, Red and Expert
Tsinghua University Launches a Heated Double-Anti Movement

    (Our Dispatch) Because Tsinghua University faculty, students, and staff participated in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site in the suburbs of Beijing, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement only began mobilization on the 20th. After President and Party Secretary Jiang Nanxiang gave a mobilization report, nearly one million big-character posters covered the Tsinghua campus in one day.

    Tsinghua University is full of revolutionary vitality. A huge couplet hangs high on the Erdao Gate of Tsinghua campus: "Launch the Double-Anti Movement, learn from Shanghai, catch up with Shanghai, strive for the top, promote the Three Diligences and sweep away the Five Bad Tendencies," "Conduct comprehensive planning, mobilize greatly, rectify greatly, destroy greatly and establish greatly, and advance towards being both Red and Expert with a great leap forward." At the venue of the mobilization meeting – the playground – students waved colorful flags and held up slogans, and various youth shock brigades launched various cultural and entertainment propaganda activities.

    President Jiang Nanxiang expounded on the purpose and requirements of the school's Double-Anti Movement at the mobilization meeting. He said that this Double-Anti Movement should focus on several major issues, with great airing of views, great blooming, great destruction, and great establishment.

    As soon as Jiang Nanxiang finished speaking, Zhang Zigao, the director of the Chemistry Teaching and Research Group and a professor in his seventies, was the first to step onto the stage. He said that the Double-Anti Movement has a great encouraging and promoting effect on us, and to achieve a great leap forward in teaching quality, there must first be a great leap forward in teachers' thinking. Zhang Zigao said that he is old and has become stagnant, and asked everyone to expose and criticize him. He concluded by saying that through this movement, everyone should become high-grade alloy steel, stronger and more united. Then, Professor Li Youshan, representing more than two thousand faculty, students, and staff of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, expressed his determination to eliminate unhealthy tendencies, conduct serious self-examination, and carry out self-transformation without reservation. Employee representatives Zhu Yinzhang and Li Yonglu also took the stage to speak one after another, and challenged each other.

    This Double-Anti Movement at Tsinghua University has a very good ideological foundation. After the anti-rightist struggle last year, an anti-waste struggle in the laboratory was launched among the faculty and staff, and a major debate on the two roads in science was launched; among the students, a major debate on being both Red and Expert was launched, and a major debate on handling rightists was conducted. All the students in the school recently participated in voluntary labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir and various Three Diligences activities. Before this movement, the school Party committee and the school administration also held several symposiums with professors, and the Party and the Communist Youth League also mobilized. Therefore, the Double-Anti Movement was triggered at any moment. Students described this situation as "the spring breeze enters Tsinghua overnight, and thousands of trees and thousands of trees bloom with red flowers."

    As of last night, the number of big-character posters had increased to more than 1.3 million. The spearhead of the big-character posters was directed at all backward phenomena in the school's work; everyone used their brains to run this socialist engineering university well. The big-character posters raised many major issues in teaching. Professor Zhang Wei, based on the situation that many teachers in the school were divorced from reality and lacked practical production experience, requested that measures be taken to allow teachers to make up for the lesson of practical production.

    Many students' big-character posters sharply exposed the bourgeois ideology of teachers, which influenced students to ignore practical production, not care about politics, and only be expert but not red. Some students in the Department of Architecture have the idea of ​​"monuments" in their designs. In their minds, designing buildings is not for use, but to leave a legacy for future generations and be recorded in history. Regarding this kind of bourgeois ideology that is divorced from reality and seeks fame and profit, the students proposed that a systematic and comprehensive criticism and examination should be carried out in the Double-Anti Movement, so that they can truly become state construction cadres who are both Red and Expert.

    The Double-Anti Movement at Tsinghua University is developing in depth. (Zhu Jigong)

    大破大立　红透专深
    清华大学双反运动热烈开展
    本报讯　清华大学师生员工由于参加了京郊十三陵水库工地的义务劳动，反浪费、反保守运动，20日才得以开始动员。校长兼党委书记蒋南翔作了动员报告以后，在一天之内，近百万张大字报布满了清华园。
    清华大学充满了革命的朝气，在清华园二道门上高挂着巨幅对联：“开展双反运动，学上海，赶上海，力争上游，推行三勤扫五气”，“进行全面规划，大发动，大整风，大破大立，齐向红专大跃进”。在动员大会的开会地点——操场上，学生们打着彩旗，举着标语，各个青年突击队展开了各种文娱宣传活动。
    校长蒋南翔在动员大会上阐述了这个学校开展双反运动的目的和要求。他说，这次双反运动要集中在几个主要问题上，大鸣大放、大破大立。
    蒋南翔的讲话刚完毕，化学教研组主任、七十多岁的老教授张子高第一个走上讲台。他说，双反运动对我们起着莫大的鼓舞和推动作用，要使教学质量大跃进，必须先在教师思想上来个大跃进。张子高说我自己年岁高迈，就有了暮气，请大家揭发批评。他最后说，通过这次运动使人人成为高级合金钢，更加坚强更加团结。接着，李酉山教授代表机械系二千多名师生员工表示决心，要打掉歪风邪气，认真检查，无保留地进行自我改造。职工代表朱荫章和李永禄也相继上台讲话，并且相互挑战。
    清华大学这次双反运动是有很好的思想基础的。在去年反右派斗争以后，先后在教职员工中间展开了实验室的反浪费斗争，开展了科学上两条道路的大辩论；在学生中间展开了又红又专的大辩论，进行了关于处理右派的大辩论，全校学生最近又参加了十三陵水库的义务劳动和各种三勤活动。这次运动前，学校党委和校行政又召开过几次教授座谈会，党和共青团也作过动员。因此，双反运动一触即发，学生们形容这种情况是“春风一夜入清华，千树万树开红花”。
    截至昨晚，大字报增加到一百三十多万张。大字报的矛头指向了学校工作中的一切落后现象；大家开动脑筋，要把这所社会主义的工科大学办好。大字报提出了教学工作中的许多重大问题。张维教授根据校内许多教师理论脱离实际，缺乏生产实践经验的情况，要求采取措施使教师们补上生产实践这一课。
    许多同学的大字报尖锐地揭发了教师中的资产阶级思想，这种思想影响到学生忽视生产实际、不关心政治、只专不红。建筑系有的学生在设计中有“纪念碑”思想，在他们的心目中，设计建筑物不是为了使用，而是为了永留后世，名载史册。对这种脱离实际、为名为利的资产阶级思想，学生们提出，要在双反运动中进行系统的、全面的批判和检查，使自己真正成为又红又专的国家建设干部。
    清华大学的双反运动正在深入发展。　（朱继功）
