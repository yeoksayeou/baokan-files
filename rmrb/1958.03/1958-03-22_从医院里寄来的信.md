    Letter from a Hospital
    All members of our Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative received a letter from Comrade Wang Gengxin of the People's Liberation Army. The letter said that he had been receiving treatment at a PLA hospital in Zhejiang Province for poor health for half a year. Upon learning that his hometown agricultural cooperative was striving for a yield of 450 jin per mu, he decided to donate 1,000 yuan to the cooperative, and has now remitted 450 yuan as a helping hand. The letter also stated that after being discharged from the hospital, he would work hard to study politics, culture, military affairs, and professional skills, and hoped that all cooperative members would, in the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains, engage in water conservancy construction and build the mountainous area.
    After the instructor read this letter to everyone during the meeting, everyone was very excited and expressed that they would love the cooperative more and work even harder. Some cooperative members said, "We don't have any other gifts to give him, so let's send some mountain products like persimmons, walnuts, and dates to show our appreciation." Some cooperative members even voluntarily brought out peppercorns to give to the cooperative so that the cooperative could sell them to buy explosives for opening mountains and digging canals. Some cooperative members expressed that they would drink and smoke less, and invest the money saved in the cooperative. (Shengli Cooperative, Shicheng Township, Pingshun County) (Attached image)

    从医院里寄来的信
    我们胜利农业生产合作社全体社员接到解放军王庚辛同志寄来的一封信。信中说，他因身体不好，在浙江省解放军某医院治病，已经半年。得知家乡农业社正在为争取亩产四百五十斤而奋斗，他决定捐给社里一千元，现在先汇去四百五十元，作为一臂之助。信中还说，他出院后要努力学习政治文化军事业务，希望全体社员以愚公移山的精神，兴修水利，建设山区。
    这封信在开会时由教员读给大家听了以后，个个都很兴奋，表示要更好的爱社，更好的劳动。有的社员说，咱没有别的礼物送人家，就送点山货柿子、核桃、枣表表心吧。有的社员还自动拿出花椒送给社里，让社里卖掉买炸药，供开山挖渠之用。有的社员表示要少喝酒、抽烟，把省下来的钱，向社里投资。　（平顺县石城乡胜利社）（附图片）
