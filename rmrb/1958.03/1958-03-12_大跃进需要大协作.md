    The Great Leap Forward Requires Great Collaboration

    Following the news of the Taiyuan City Collaboration Conference, today we are publishing news of Shanghai's support for the six provinces of East China in developing industry. The Great Leap Forward requires great collaboration. Taiyuan is a large-scale collaboration within a region, while Shanghai and the six provinces of East China are a large-scale collaboration between several regions; regardless of the method, these practices will bring great benefits to the Great Leap Forward.

    Looking at the materials listed in the Shanghai news, in this year alone, Shanghai will help the six provinces build nineteen new factories and mines. In return, these provinces will provide Shanghai with a large amount of raw materials for heavy industry and light industry, helping Shanghai, this large industrial base, to develop further. How much new productivity this great collaboration will generate is currently impossible to estimate.

    Breaking down the limitations of various industries and regions, and organizing large-scale internal and mutual collaboration in industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, and education, will bring tremendous new productive forces to the socialist motherland, and no one should underestimate this issue.

    大跃进需要大协作
    继太原市召开协作会议的消息之后，今天我们又发表了上海支援华东六省发展工业的消息。大跃进需要大协作。太原是在一个地区范围以内的大协作，上海和华东六省是在几个地区之间的大协作；不论方式如何，这些作法都将给大跃进带来大好处。
    且看上海消息里所列举的材料，仅仅今年一年，上海就要帮助六个省建设十九个新厂矿。反过来，这些省又将为上海提供大量的重工业原料和轻工业原料，帮助上海这个大工业基地进一步向前发展。这个大协作将产生多少新生产力出来，现在是无法估计的。
    打破各种行业和各个地区的限制，组织工业、农业、商业、文教各方面内部的和相互的大协作，将给社会主义的祖国带来巨大的新生产力，任何人都不应该看轻这个问题。
