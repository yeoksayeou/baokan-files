Exciting, Tense, and Thrilling
2∶1 Victory for the Soviet Team over the Beijing Team

(Our dispatch) Yesterday, the Beijing football team faced the Soviet football team at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium, and the result was a 2-1 defeat for the Beijing team. The Soviet team played well yesterday. Although the Beijing team lost, they also played well, as they demonstrated a high level of performance.

Yesterday, the Beijing team played actively and energetically. In the first half, their offensive momentum was even greater than their opponents. The first goal was scored by the Beijing team. At the 40-minute mark, Chen Jialiang, the right inside forward of the Beijing team, received the ball and passed it directly to the open space ahead. Cong Zheyu sprinted at high speed, vượt qua vượt quá vượt qua over the opponent's defender, caught up in one step, and passed the ball to Wang Lu, who was rushing up on the left. At this time, there was no one to block him in front of the goal. Wang Lu lifted his foot and powerfully shot the ball into the net from a dozen meters to the right of the goal. The Beijing team opened the scoring. The trajectory of this goal was clear, and the passing and shooting were clean and neat. The audience repeatedly cheered for this wonderful goal. The first half ended with a score of 1-0.

In the second half, the Soviet team brought on Tatushin, who was fast, had a powerful shot, and provided good passes, and Ivanov, who could play a crucial role in linking the play. The situation greatly improved, and the five forwards were extremely active. Just one and a half minutes into the second half, Tatushin received the ball on the sideline and passed it to Ivanov. At this time, Gusarov cut in from the left, and Ivanov timely passed the ball to Gusarov. Gusarov shot and scored, tying the score at 1-1. The clarity of the ball's trajectory and the neatness of the movements in this goal were comparable to the first goal scored by the Beijing team. At the 20-minute mark, Gusarov shot again from a dozen meters in front of the goal, making the score 2-1, and the Soviet team reversed the defeat into victory. Afterwards, both sides had several good scoring opportunities, but they were either thwarted by the opponent's defense or missed due to their own mistakes, ultimately failing to score. One minute before the end of the game, Sun Fucheng received the ball on the left sideline and made a high cross, which landed right in front of the goal, three meters away. Zhang Honggen shot with his left foot, but unfortunately, the ball went out of bounds from the crossbar. The Beijing team lost this opportunity to tie the score, and the audience couldn't help but feel sorry for them.

    精彩、紧张、扣人心弦
    2∶1苏联队胜北京队
    本报讯  昨天北京足球队在先农坛体育场迎战苏联足球队，结果二比一北京队败了。苏联队昨天打得好。北京队虽输了应该说打得也好。因为他们打出很高的水平。
    昨天北京队打得积极活跃，在上半时他们的攻势比对方还多。第一个球就是北京队先打进的。在四十分钟时，北京队右内锋陈家亮接得来球直传前面空档，丛者余以高速度冲刺越过对方后卫，赶上一步把球传给左方冲上的王陆，这时，对方门前已无人阻挡，王陆在大门右方十几公尺处举足劲射入网，北京队首开纪录。这个球路线清楚，传递射门都干净俐落，观众一再为这一精彩球欢呼。上半时以一比零结束。
    下半时，苏联队换上了冲刺快、脚头硬、供球好的塔图辛和能起穿针引线作用的伊凡诺夫，局面大有开展，前面五锋异常活跃。刚一分半钟，塔图辛边线得球运传伊凡诺夫，这时古萨洛夫从左方切进，伊及时把球传给古萨洛夫，古一射中门，扳成一平。这一球球路的清楚，动作的俐落，可同北京队射入的第一球相媲美。二十分钟时，古萨洛夫在门前十几公尺处再次射球入网，场上纪录成二比一，苏联队反败为胜。以后双方都有几次射门的好机会，但不是被对方守卫破坏，就是自己失机，终无建树。在终场前一分钟孙福成在左边线得球，高吊传中，正落在门前三公尺处，张宏根左脚打门，可惜球从大门横木上出界。北京队失掉了这一打平的机会，观众为之惋惜不止。
