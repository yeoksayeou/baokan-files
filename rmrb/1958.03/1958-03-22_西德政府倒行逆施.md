The West German Government's Retrogressive Actions
By Our Commentator

In the current international situation, the overriding demand of the people is to accelerate the holding of a summit conference between Eastern and Western countries to seek an end to the "Cold War" and ease international tensions. However, at this very moment, the West German government, following the United States, is coming out to undermine the convening of a summit conference.

In a statement issued on March 15, the West German government said that it would continue to advocate, by all means, that any summit conference must discuss the German question. This statement by the West German government is, in reality, nothing more than a repetition of a tune that the United States has already sung. From the very beginning of the discussion on a summit conference, the United States has put forward the idea that the summit conference must discuss the question of German reunification. However, the German reunification issue is a matter for the German people themselves, and should only be resolved through consultation between the two Germanys. No one else can act on their behalf. The purpose of the United States in putting forward this idea is to obstruct the convening of the summit conference and lead it to failure.

The Soviet government has repeatedly refuted this unreasonable demand by the United States, and at the same time proposed that the summit conference could discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet Union believes that the summit conference's discussion on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany would promote progress in restoring German reunification, which is in the interests of the German nation. However, the West German government is desperately following the United States, insisting on handing over Germany's internal affairs to the summit conference of Eastern and Western countries. This incomprehensible action can only be seen as deliberately creating difficulties for the convening of the summit conference.

Not only that, but West German Chancellor Adenauer also stated in the foreign policy debate in the West German Federal Parliament on March 20 that, after "careful" consideration, the West German government has decided that it must equip its army with atomic weapons and allow the establishment of American rocket bases on its territory. Adenauer openly wants to push West Germany onto the path of preparing for nuclear war at a time when the world is demanding the easing of tensions. This will not only subject the West German people to the threat of destruction, but also make the situation in Europe tense. This approach of the West German government is entirely in accordance with the will of the United States. It attempts to create a fait accompli of equipping the West German army with atomic weapons before the summit conference is held, which is completely contrary to the road to restoring German reunification. Therefore, Adenauer's statement was not only immediately severely condemned by the First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Lehmann, and fiercely criticized by many members of the West German parliament, but it will also be resolutely opposed by the people of the world.

    西德政府倒行逆施
    本报评论员
    在目前的国际局势中，人们压倒一切的要求是加速举行东西方国家最高级会议，以谋求停止“冷战”和缓和国际局势。但是，就在这个时候，西德政府竟跟着美国，出来破坏最高级会议的召开。
    西德政府在3月15日发表声明说，它将继续用一切办法主张任何最高级会议都必须讨论德国问题。西德政府的这个声明，实际上不过是重复了美国早已唱过了的调子。美国从关于最高级会议的讨论一开始，就曾提出最高级会议必须讨论德国统一问题的主张。但是，德国统一问题是德国人民自己内部的问题，只应由两个德国通过协商来加以解决，别人无论是谁都不能越俎代庖。美国所以提出这个主张，其目的是为了阻挠最高级会议的召开，并使它走上失败的道路。
    苏联政府对美国的这种无理主张曾一再加以驳斥，同时提出最高级会议可以讨论对德和约问题。苏联认为最高级会议关于对德和约问题的讨论将可以推动恢复德国统一问题的进展，这是符合于德国民族的利益的。但是，西德政府却死命地追随美国，硬要把德国自己内部的问题交给东西方国家的最高级会议去讨论，这种无法令人理解的行动只能被认为是故意为最高级会议的召开制造困难。
    不只如此。西德政府总理阿登纳还在3月20日的西德联邦议院的外交辩论中声称，西德政府经过“慎重”考虑之后决定，必须用原子武器装备它的军队和准许在它的境内设立美国火箭基地。阿登纳公然在举世要求缓和紧张局势的时候，要把西德推向准备核子战争的道路上去。这不仅会使西德人民遭受到毁灭的威胁，而且会使欧洲的局势紧张起来。西德政府的这种做法，是完全按照美国意志做的。它企图在最高级会议召开之前，造成用原子武器装备西德军队的既成事实，这是同恢复德国统一的道路完全背道而驰的。因之，阿登纳的声明，不仅立即遭到了德共第一书记雷曼的严厉谴责，在西德议会里遭到了许多议员的猛烈抨击，并且也必将为全世界人民所坚决反对。
