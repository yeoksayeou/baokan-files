Xinhua News Agency Report: Thai socialist united front party representatives and representatives of peace advocates held a meeting on March 3rd, resolving to protest the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's (SEATO) scheduled military exercises in April and to protest the United States' nuclear weapons exercises scheduled to be held soon.

The meeting was presided over by Nai Thep Chotinuchit, chairman of the Socialist United Front. Representatives from the seven parties of the United Front—the Economists Party, the Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Hyde Park Movement Party, the Great Alliance Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Labor Party—participated in the meeting.

The meeting decided to deliver letters of protest to the embassies of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states in Thailand and to hold a mass rally in Bangkok on April 6 to protest SEATO's military exercises in Thailand.

The meeting also decided to write to governments of various countries, calling on major powers to cease testing all nuclear weapons.

The meeting also decided to issue a statement opposing the Thai government's acceptance of rocket weapons.

According to a report in the Thai newspaper "Freedom Communications" on March 2nd, Nai Charoen, a member of parliament in the Thai Socialist United Front, submitted an urgent interpellation to the Thai Ministry of Defense, questioning whether the Thai authorities expressed their willingness to accept American rocket weapons due to pressure from the United States, and whether the government could break free from this pressure.
