Drive Fast Train Engines, Race Against Time
Shanghai Railway Bureau Leaves Old Targets Far Behind

(Our Shanghai dispatch, February 28th) Our reporter reports: In the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, the Shanghai Railway Bureau mobilized the masses to launch a powerful attack on conservative and backward phenomena, clearing away various outdated rules and regulations that hindered the development of productive forces, thus enabling the entire work to achieve an unprecedented leap forward.

The Railway Bureau has now put forward a series of inspiring new goals: The bureau will increase the total output of locomotives from 770,000 tons/km per day to 1 million tons/km per day, starting from March 3rd. The daily mileage of locomotives will increase from 412 km to 480 km, and the traction weight of each locomotive will increase from 1,700 tons to 2,200 tons. Trains on all railway lines under the bureau will generally shorten their travel time. A total of 21 pairs of passenger trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, and Nanjing-Wuhu lines will reduce their travel time by 40 hours.

The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production urgently requires a corresponding great leap forward in railway transportation. This year, industrial and agricultural production in Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi in East China will have substantial growth. Taking local industry as an example, the local industry in Shanghai is expected to grow by more than 30% this year, which requires the railway transportation work to keep up. However, the potential in railway work in the Shanghai area is very large, and some conservative rules and regulations are restricting the development of productive forces. This is the situation facing the Shanghai Railway Bureau. In January this year, the Railway Bureau convened an enlarged meeting of cadres, which started a competition movement centered on anti-waste and anti-conservatism to compare with, catch up with, and learn from the advanced. This movement reached an unprecedented climax in the days after the Spring Festival, exposing various forms of tangible waste amounting to more than 20 million yuan. The exposure of a large amount of waste not only encouraged the morale of the masses but also increasingly clearly showed that the losses caused by conservatism in railway work were the biggest waste, which was much larger than the numbers of general extravagance and waste. For example, the waste of locomotives and rolling stock caused by the poor operation of vehicles amounted to 12 million yuan. This is not even the largest amount. As a result, the masses began to point the finger at production conservatism and some conservative rules and regulations, launching a fierce struggle against conservative ideology.

The anti-conservatism struggle mainly targeted some key issues, such as increasing vehicle travel speed and increasing material load capacity. On the one hand, the railway transport capacity of various lines in the Shanghai Railway Bureau system has approached the saturation point, and the leadership has to consider investing in laying double tracks. On the other hand, the vehicle travel speed is not high, and the potential is great. For example, the express train from Shanghai to Nanjing requires five hours and two minutes. This time, the masses proposed that it could be shortened to just over four hours. However, to increase to this speed, the cooperation of the engineering departments is required to increase the passing speed of straight turnouts from the current 75 kilometers to 80 kilometers, and the speed of lateral turnouts should also be increased from 35 kilometers to 40 kilometers. However, this proposal was opposed by the leaders and technicians of the engineering department and the engineering section. The reason for the opposition was that the current formula could only run 33 kilometers, and now it has been increased by two kilometers, so it is impossible to break through this conventional limit. The two sides launched a fierce debate. Under the help of workers and the Party, Yu Youxin, the chief of the Nanjing Engineering Section, began to waver in his conservative thinking. At this time, he visited and researched with veteran workers, and at the same time spent ten days working with technicians to conduct on-site tests and records at three stations in Zhenjiang, Puzhen, and Nanjing. Finally, through experiments, it was proved that the workers' opinions were correct, and it was entirely possible to speed up. In fact, many vehicles had already broken through the old rules, and it was determined that lateral turnouts could not only travel 40 kilometers but could also be increased to 45 kilometers. After this field investigation, the debate came to an end, and the leaders of the Railway Bureau decided to generally shorten the travel time of trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line and other lines. The express train between Shanghai and Nanjing has been decided to be compressed from five hours and two minutes to three hours and fifty-nine minutes.

In addition, anti-conservatism struggles were launched in loading and shunting. The masses not only used reasoning, but also used actual production results to constantly throw various old targets far behind.

The Shanghai Railway Bureau's anti-waste and anti-conservatism has now made great progress. The bureau is drawing up a new train schedule to generally shorten train travel times. This schedule was originally scheduled to be completed on March 15th, but it has recently been decided to be completed as early as March 3rd. According to this schedule, 21 pairs of passenger trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou and other railway trunk lines under the Shanghai Railway Bureau will generally shorten their time, with some reducing by more than two hours and others reducing by one hour. The transportation speed of freight cars will also be greatly improved. The bureau also decided that starting from 6:00 p.m. on March 3rd, the daily output of each locomotive will be increased from the current 770,000 tons/km to 1 million tons/km.

The targets for increasing production and practicing economy put forward by the staff and workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have been increased repeatedly, from the initial 22 million to 40 million, and they are striving to reach 50 million.

When boldly supporting the masses to break through old rules, revise conservative targets, and implement new measures, the Shanghai Railway Bureau has adopted a responsible attitude in technology. Before implementing each new measure, it must first conduct repeated field investigations, research, and experiments to confirm its feasibility before implementing it. For example, recently, before implementing the target of 1 million tons/km per day for locomotive production, experiments were first conducted in the Shanghai and Nanjing regions. Before implementing the new train running speed, it also went through many practices, and technicians went to the site to observe, measure, and check the tracks and vehicles, proving that there is great potential to be tapped in "pulling more and running faster." The new travel time of the Shanghai-Nanjing express train has also been proven to be feasible by the test run on the 26th.

    开快火车头　同时间赛跑
    上海铁路局把旧指标远远抛在后面
    本报上海28日电　本报记者报道：上海铁路管理局在反浪费、反保守运动中发动群众对保守、落后现象进行了强有力地冲击，清除了各种阻碍生产力发展的陈旧规章制度，使整个工作空前跃进。
    这个铁路局现在提出了一系列的振奋人心的新目标：全局将从3月3日起机车生产量全部由日产七十七万吨公里提高到日产百万吨公里。机车日行公里从四百一十二公里提高到四百八十公里，每台机车的牵引重量从一千七百吨提高到二千二百吨。全局所属各铁路线的列车，将普遍缩短行驶时间，沪宁、沪杭、宁芜等线的二十一对客车共将缩短四十小时。
    工农业生产的大跃进，迫切地要求铁路运输工作相应地来个大跃进。上海和江苏、浙江、安徽、江西等华东各省，今年工农业生产都将有极大的增长。仅以地方工业而论，上海地方工业今年预计将增长30％以上，它们要求铁路运输工作能跟上去。而上海区的铁路工作中潜力很大，一些保守的规章制度束缚着生产力的发展。这就是上海铁路局所面临的形势。今年1月间铁路局召开了干部扩大会议，开始掀起了一个以反浪费反保守为中心的比先进、赶先进、学先进的竞赛运动，这个运动在春节以后的这几天中达到了前所未有的高潮，揭发出的各种有形浪费达二千多万元。大量浪费现象的揭发，一方面鼓舞了群众的斗志，一方面也愈来愈明显地表明，铁路工作上由于保守而遭致的损失乃是最大的浪费，它比一般铺张浪费的数字大得多。例如由于车辆运行不好而造成的机车车辆浪费一项，就达一千二百万元。这还不是一个最大的数目。于是，群众就开始把矛头指向生产上的保守和一些保守的规章制度，与保守思想展开了激烈斗争。
    反保守斗争主要是针对了一些关键问题进行的，如提高车辆行驶速度，提高物资载重量等等。上海铁路局系统的各线，一方面铁路运输力已接近饱和点，领导不得不考虑投资铺设复线，但另一方面车辆行驶速度并不高，潜力很大，如上海到南京的特快车就需要五小时零二分。这次群众提出可以缩短到四小时多。但是要提高到这个速度，就得要工务部门的配合，把直向通岔的通过速度从现在的七十五公里提高到八十公里，侧向通岔速度也要从三十五公里提高到四十公里。可是这个建议遭到了工务处和工务段的领导以及技术人员们的反对，反对的理由是用现用的公式计算只能跑三十三公里，现在已提高了两公里，不能再突破这个常规。双方展开了激烈的争论，南京工务段段长俞又新在工人和党的帮助下，保守思想开始动摇，这时他就向老工人进行了访问研究，同时并用了十来天的时间，和技术人员一起到镇江、浦镇、南京等三个站，进行了实地的测验和记录。最后，通过试验，证明了工人的意见是正确的，加快速度完全可能，而且事实上早已有不少车辆突破陈规，确定侧向通岔不但能走四十公里，而且还可以提高到四十五公里。经过这个实地调查，争论告一段落，铁路局领导上决定把沪宁线，以及其他各线列车行驶时间普遍缩短。上海—南京间的特快车已决定由五点零二分压缩到三点五十九分。
    另外在装车、调车方面，都展开了反保守的斗争，群众不但用说理，而且用实际生产成绩，不断地把各种旧有的指标远远地抛在后边。
    上海铁路管理局的反浪费、反保守现在已取得了巨大进展。这个局正在拟订一个新的列车运行图，把列车行驶时间普遍缩短。这个运行图原来要在3月15日才能完成，最近已决定提早到3日完成。根据这个运行图，上海铁路局所属的沪宁、沪杭等各铁路干线上的二十一对客车，将普遍缩短时间，多的有两小时以上，少的也有一小时。货车的运输速度也将大大提高。这个局还决定从3月3日下午六时开始，每台机车日产由现在的七十七万吨公里，提高到日产百万吨公里。
    上海铁路局职工提出的增产节约指标，已一再加码，由最初的二千二百万，增加到四千万，并且要争取达到五千万。
    上海铁路局在大胆地支持群众突破陈规，修改保守指标，推行新的措施时，在技术上又采取了负责的态度，每项新措施在执行前，必定先反复进行实地调查研究试验，证实可行后再推行。例如最近在实行机车日产量百万吨公里的指标前，就首先在上海和南京两个地区进行了试验。在实行新的列车运行速度前，也经过许多次的实践，经过技术人员到现场实地观察、测量，检查路轨和车辆，证明“拉多，跑快”有很大的潜力可以挖掘。沪宁特快车的新行驶时间，经26日试车也已证明是可行的。
