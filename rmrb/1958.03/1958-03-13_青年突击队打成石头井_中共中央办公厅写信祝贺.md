Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 12th. The youth shock brigade members of Lingxia Agricultural Cooperative in Baicheng County, Jilin Province, who succeeded in digging a well on a rocky mountain despite the severe cold, recently received a letter of congratulations from the General Office of the CPC Central Committee. The letter stated: "In order to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development, reclaim barren mountains, and transform dry land into irrigated land to overcome drought and increase grain production, you have overcome difficulties with revolutionary zeal, used simple tools to dig wells in the rock, and achieved results. This spirit is worthy of being promoted." The letter also included a photo of Chairman Mao.

After seeing the letter and the leader's photo, the youth shock brigade members became even more motivated to dig wells. At the drilling competition held the next day, they expressed their determination to repay the care of the Party Central Committee with even greater achievements. The plan was revised at the meeting. The original plan was to complete 23 stone wells by the summer hoeing season, but now it has been decided to strive to complete all of them by the end of March to meet the needs of spring farming and large-scale production.

In early February, when the youth first dug water from a well on the rocky mountain, the whole cooperative was in jubilation. The youth once sent a bottle of well water and several pieces of rock to Chairman Mao. (Illustration by Miao Di)

    青年突击队打成石头井
    中共中央办公厅写信祝贺
    新华社长春12日电　不怕天寒地冻，在石山上打井成功的吉林省白城县岭下农业社的青年突击队员们，最近接到了中共中央办公厅写来的一封贺信。信中说：“你们为了实现农业发展纲要，开垦荒山，旱田改水浇田，达到战胜旱灾增产粮食的目的，以革命的干劲，克服困难，用简单的工具在岩石上凿井，并作出成绩来，这种精神是值得发扬的。”信中还附有毛主席的照片。
    青年突击队员们看到了信和领袖的照片后，打井的劲头更大了。在第二天举行的打擂大会上，他们纷纷表示要以更大的成绩，来报答党中央的关怀。会上修订了计划，原来准备到夏锄期间打成二十三眼石头井，现在决定力争在3月末就全部完成这个任务，以适应春耕大生产的需要。
    2月上旬，当青年们第一次从石头山上打井打出水来的时候，全社一片欢腾。青年们曾将井水一瓶、岩石若干块，送给了毛主席。　（苗地插图）
