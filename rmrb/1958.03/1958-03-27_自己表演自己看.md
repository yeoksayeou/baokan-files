Brothers Countries Cultural Life

    In the evenings, textile workers in the Soviet city of Orekhovo-Zuyevo often dress up in beautiful clothes and go to the Cultural Palace to listen to the performance of "their own" symphony orchestra. Why is it called "their own" orchestra? It turns out that this is an amateur orchestra of the employees of the Nikolayeva Textile Factory. Each of the one hundred musicians is a familiar companion to the audience. The fitter, Shuryansky, is the first violinist, and the lab technician, Anisheva, is also a violinist.... Although this orchestra has only been established for five years, it can skillfully play symphonies by famous composers. No wonder this orchestra is called the pride of the textile workers.

    The scale of the Textile Workers' Cultural Palace is very large. In addition to a large performance hall with more than a thousand seats, a film projection hall, a library, etc., it also has special activity rooms for various amateur art groups. Here, you can see the employees' children rehearsing ballet, the amateur actors of the drama group rehearsing Molière's comedies, the factory nurses practicing solo singing.... A total of nine hundred employees participate in amateur cultural and recreational organizations!

    In addition to listening to music, watching plays, and watching movies at the Cultural Palace, the textile workers of Orekhovo-Zuyevo can also enjoy singing and dancing at home. Because "red corners" are generally set up in the staff dormitories. Every evening, the "red corners" are often crowded with employees and their families, and small-scale performances are held by dance groups, drama groups, choirs, etc. There are forty-eight such "red corners" in the staff dormitories.

    Soviet workers are full of energy in production and very active in cultural and recreational activities. The textile workers of Orekhovo-Zuyevo in the Moscow region are just one example. In the Soviet Union, every factory has "its own" amateur art organization, usually including orchestras, dance groups, drama groups, choirs, etc. Moreover, some amateur organizations enjoy a high reputation for their performances. The amateur workers' theater troupe of the Gorbunov Cultural Palace in Moscow is like this. This workers' theater troupe has staged more than forty plays and recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. The actors in the troupe are of different ages and occupations, including fitters, assemblers, engineers, and lawyers, but their love for drama brings them together, and they work hard and create hard. As a result, it always ranks among the best in the Moscow amateur theater festival.

    自己表演自己看
    傍晚，苏联奥列霍夫—兹耶夫城的纺织工人时常穿上漂亮的衣服到文化宫去听“自己的”交响乐队的演奏。为什么说是“自己的”乐队呢？原来这是尼古拉耶娃纺织厂职工们的业余乐队。一百名乐手个个都是听众们熟识的同伴，钳工舒梁斯基是第一小提琴手，化验员阿尼舍娃也是小提琴手……。这支乐队虽然成立才五年，但它可以熟练地演奏著名作曲家的交响乐。无怪乎这个乐队被称作纺织工人的骄傲了。
    纺织工人文化宫的规模是很大的。除拥有一千多个座位的大演出厅、电影放映厅、图书馆等外，还为各种业余艺术小组设有专门的活动室。在这儿，你可以看到职工的孩子们在排练芭蕾舞，看到戏剧组的业余演员们正在排演莫里哀的喜剧，看到工厂的女护士正在练习独唱……。参加业余文娱组织的共有九百个职工呢！
    奥列霍夫—兹耶夫城的纺织工人们，除了可以在文化宫听音乐、看剧、看电影外，在家里也可以欣赏歌舞。因为职工宿舍里普遍设有“红角”。每到晚上，“红角”里常是挤满了职工和家属，由舞蹈组、戏剧组、合唱队等举行小规模的演出。职工宿舍就有四十八个这样的“红角”。
    苏联工人们在生产上干劲十足，在文娱活动上也是非常活跃的。莫斯科州奥列霍夫—兹耶夫城的纺织工人只不过是一个例子。在苏联，无论哪一个工厂都有“自己的”业余艺术组织，通常包括有乐队、舞蹈组、戏剧组、合唱队等。而且有些业余组织的演出享有很高的声誉。像莫斯科戈尔布诺夫文化宫的业余工人剧团就是这样。这个工人剧团已上演过四十多出话剧，不久前刚刚庆祝了成立的二十五周年。剧团的演员年龄不同职业也不同，其中有钳工、装配工，也有工程师和律师，但是对话剧艺术的爱好把他们联系在一起，他们努力合作，努力创造。结果，在莫斯科业余剧团会演时，它总是名列前茅。
