Myth and Fact
By our correspondent Chen Yongjin

Two hundred li south of Kunming is a lake called Tonghai. There is a county there called Elu County, which was recently formed by merging Tonghai County and Hexi County. The county is surrounded by mountains, with the vast Tonghai Lake in the middle. For generations, the people here have had very little land. The land along the lake is prone to flooding during rains, and the land on the hillside cannot be irrigated even when the lake water is visible during droughts. Because of the scarcity of land, many people here in the past were engaged in business, carpentry, and blacksmithing. The branch secretary of Jinshan Township said: Before liberation, no matter what kind of work you did, it was difficult to get enough to eat. 80% of the people in our Jinshan Township couldn't get enough grain to last half a year. Comrade Ma Xun of the County Committee said: Only after cooperativization, Elu County vigorously developed water conservancy, increasing the past 30,000 mu of paddy fields to 80,000 mu, and only then did it change from a grain-deficient county to a grain-surplus county.

Because of the lack of grain, the people here have longed for land for generations. But surrounded by mountains, cultivating a few mu of land on the mountain sometimes doesn't even earn back the seeds. Reclaiming land from the lake was only possible for wealthy families with boats. Reclaiming one mu of lake land required dredging three hundred boats of lake mud, and during heavy rains, it was hard to guarantee that such lake land wouldn't be flooded. Therefore, a myth was widely circulated among the people here: In the past, there was an immortal named Li Panfu who used his tin staff to point at a sinkhole at the foot of a cliff in the southeast of Tonghai, creating a large area of fertile lake land. During heavy rains, the water would flow out of this sinkhole, no longer flooding their little bit of land; during droughts, the lake water could also be used for irrigation. To commemorate this immortal, the people here specially built a temple on the beautiful Xiushan Mountain. This is just a myth, of course. As for the sinkhole in Yuejiaying on the edge of Tonghai, it does play a role in lowering the lake's water level. But this myth, which has been circulating in the hearts of the people for a long time, has become even more beautiful than a myth in the high tide of socialist construction.

Not far west of Elu County, passing through a belt of already firm rape and broad bean fields, is a construction site. Here, there are people carrying earth, pushing earth, driving ox carts to pull earth; there are those using newly invented tampers to tamp the earth, and those using stone rollers to roll the road. Stonemasons are chiseling stones. Red flags are flying in the wind on the construction site. What they are building looks like a dam and a road. Hu Yongchong, the branch secretary of Jinshan Township, pointed to the vast lake water in the west and said: We are building a dam. This dam will block the water of the Zhonghe River, and when the water in Tonghai is drained in the future, we will use the water from this reservoir to irrigate the fields. Comrade Ma Xun pointed to the mountains surrounding Tonghai Lake and said: There are eighteen rivers flowing into Tonghai Lake. This year, we will build reservoirs on the hillside at the entrance of these eighteen rivers, turning this sixty-li-long lake into many small lakes. Now the project has started in full swing. The sinkhole in Yuejiaying needs to be dug seven meters deeper, which will basically drain the water from Tonghai. Just from this lake alone, we can get more than 60,000 mu of good fields. These eighteen reservoirs on the hillside will also expand the paddy fields on the hillside by two or three thousand mu. At this time, he looked at the black lake mud under the culvert of the dam and said: The land in this lake is so fertile, each mu can yield at least 1,000 jin, and there is no need to apply fertilizer for three years. At this time, Lao Ma looked at the vast lake water and smiled, and said: During the Qing Dynasty, there was a landlord named Zhang Daxiu, who was determined to drain the water and cultivate lake land. He dug the sinkhole in Yuejiaying deeper, and the water flowed into the hole for a few days, exposing some fields. However, the masses on the edge of the lake rose up to oppose him, fearing that draining the lake water would leave them without water for irrigation, so he had to block the enlarged hole again. After the land reform, whenever the county and district studied production, the masses would raise the demand for reclaiming lake land. In order to expand the cultivated area, the County Committee also thought about letting the water of Tonghai flow out of the sinkhole to get more lake land. However, if the lake water was drained, what would be used to irrigate the land during droughts? Everyone wanted to drain the water of Tonghai to get fields, but no one wanted to give it up. After cooperativization, with more people and greater strength, the masses used the method of digging mud from Dian Lake, and in the past few years, they increased more than 1,000 mu of fields.

Last November, after the Yunnan Provincial Party Congress, Luan Zhong, the Secretary of the Elu County Party Committee, raised the issue of draining the lake water and planting lake fields again. The District Committee also expressed its agreement. They surveyed the depth of the lake, the deepest being only six or seven meters. They also studied the method of turning a large lake into small lakes, and then enclosing the springs that come out of the lake bottom, so that they could drain the water to get fields and also use the lake water to irrigate the land. Then they launched publicity and debate throughout the county. The masses' thinking immediately became enlightened and quickly turned into the power to conquer nature, so tens of thousands of people ran to the construction site and worked day and night.

This day, in the late morning, the strong wind on the Yunnan Plateau arrived on time, and the waves of Tonghai Lake gradually rose. Everyone who comes here wants to see the Weilongtan (that is, the eye from which water comes out of the ground, which the locals call Longtan)! Because it was nearly noon, Comrade Lao Ma from the county asked us to go to the construction site of the nearest Weilongtan. When the comrades of Wanjia Cooperative heard that someone was coming to visit their Weilongtan project, they immediately put down their rice bowls, took oars from their homes, and rowed us there.

The small boat went along a small river for not far, and then arrived at the big lake. Several egrets flew past from near the water. The wind grew stronger and stronger, and the waves hit one after another. Li Liyong smiled as he rowed and said: Look, comrades! As soon as the wind blows, the water in this lake becomes muddy. Why is it muddy? This is because the water is shallow. In less than a month of draining the water, the lake water has become more than a foot shallower, and such a large area of lake land has been exposed. In a few days, we can cultivate the land and plant rice. At this moment, the wind and waves were even greater than before, and the two old men were obviously working harder to row the boat, but Li Liyong tried his best to row the boat westward, his intention being to have us see the Weilongtan project on the west side of the lake before turning back to see the east side. He also said: Since we're here once, we have to see all these places. Comrade Lao Ma asked them to row the boat with the wind to the project on the east side, so that they could save some energy. Li Liyong still rowed westward and said: It's easy to row, no matter how strong the wind is, it's not as strong as us, and we'll be there in a little while. Comrade Lao Ma said a lot of words before persuading the two old men. They turned the boat around and rowed very fast, arriving at the Weilongtan construction site on the east side in less than an hour. The Weilongtan project covers several mu of land and is now surrounded by a circle of tall wooden stakes. In between the two rows of wooden stakes, some places have been filled with mud. How much perseverance these people building socialism must have! They transported the soil from so far away and built a wall around the Longtan, so that the Longtan water is higher than the ground of the future lake land. Now there is no one on this project, and there are very few boats on the entire lake. Here, there is only the sound of red flags waving in the west wind, here, there is only the sound of the west wind raging in the lake water. Li Liyong stood on the bow of the boat, smoking a cigarette, looking at the endless lake water, and said softly: How good it would be to see the west side again. His eyes were fixed on the turbulent lake, smiling - probably he was imagining the moving scene when the waves of the lake turned into golden waves of grain!

It took about an hour and a half to return from the center of the lake to the shore. After eating something, we rushed to the sinkhole in Yuejiaying. The water of Tonghai is to flow out of this sinkhole. When we came here last November, the hillside here was still full of trees. In such a short period of time, it has become unrecognizable - now there are a large number of stones piled up here that have been dug out of the sinkhole. We came at the right time, in about half an hour, the second sinkhole will be draining water. When we first came here, the sinkhole was still far from the lake water, but the people who were eager to plant lake fields had deepened the sinkhole in such a short period of time, and now the first sinkhole is draining water. If the second and third sinkholes drain water at the same time, the lake fields of Tonghai will be quickly exposed. Before the sinkhole was drained, some people suspected: Will the water from such a big lake flowing out of the sinkhole cause floods in other places? However, soon after the sinkhole was drained, good news came from Huaning County on the other side of the mountain. The water from the sinkhole came out of a Longtan in Huaning County, and the dried-up Huaning River also had five inches of water. These waters can also be used to irrigate a lot of farmland.

    神话与事实
    本报记者　陈勇进
    在昆明的南面二百里路远，有个湖叫做通海。这里有个县叫做?麓县，是不久前由通海县和河西县合并在一起的。这个县四周是群山，当中是烟波浩渺的通海湖。世世代代，这里的人民都很少有土地。滨湖的一些土地，下雨时怕淹；半山坡的土地，天旱时看着湖水也没法灌溉。因为土地少，这里的人们，在过去是做生意的多，做木匠、铁匠活的也多。金山乡的支部书记说：解放前不管做那样活，都很难吃得饱，我们金山乡的群众，80％的人的粮食吃不到半年。县委会的马洵同志说：?麓县直到合作化后，大力兴修了水利，把过去的三万亩水田增加到八万亩，才从缺粮县变成了余粮县。
    这里的人们，因为缺少粮食，世世代代地盼望着土地。可是四周都是山，在山上开几亩地，有时还赚不过种子来，垫湖田，只有有船的富裕人家才能办得到。垫一亩湖田要捞三百船湖泥，每逢大雨，这样的湖田就很难说不被淹。因此这里的群众普遍地流行着一个神话：过去有一个叫李畔富的仙人，用锡杖在通海东南面的山崖下点了个落水洞，落出大片的肥湖田。雨大时，水就从这个落水洞里流走，再也不淹他们那点点土地了；天旱时，湖水还可以用来灌溉。这里的群众为了纪念这个仙人，特地在美丽的秀山上筑了一个庙。这只不过是神话而已，至于通海边上岳家营的落水洞，确实起着降低湖水水位的作用。但是这个在人民心目中流传已久的神话，却在社会主义建设的高潮中，变得比神话还要美好。
    在?麓县西不远，穿过一带已经结实的油菜田和蚕豆田，便是一个正在施工的工地。这里有挑土的，有推土的，有赶着牛车拉土的；有用新发明的打夯机打夯的，有用石滚轧路的。石匠们在叮噹的打石头。工地上的红旗随风飘展。他们正在修建的，像是堤坝，又像是公路。金山乡支书胡永崇指着西面那广阔的湖水说：我们修的是拦河坝。这个坝要把中河的水拦着，将来通海的水放干后，就用这个水库的水来浇田。马洵同志又指着那通海湖周围的群山说：流往通海湖的河共有十八条，我们今年要在这十八条河入口的半山坡修上水库，使这六十里长的大湖变成许多小湖。现在工程已全部动工了。岳家营那边的落水洞，再往下打七公尺，就基本上可把通海的水放干。只这个湖，我们就可弄到六万多亩好田。这半山坡的十八个水库，还要在半山坡上扩大两三万亩水田。这时，他看了看修拦河坝涵洞下的黑湖泥说：这湖里的地可肥啦，每亩至少可收一千斤，三年里不用施肥。这时，老马看着那茫茫的湖水笑了笑，说：清朝的时候，有个地主叫张大袖子，他一心要放水搞湖田。他把岳家营的落水洞挖深，水往洞子里流了几天，也露出一些田，可是湖边上的群众却起来反对他，怕把湖水放干了，没得水浇田，他只好又把扒大的洞口堵上了。土改后，县里区里每每研究生产的时候，群众就提出垫湖田的要求。县委会为了扩大耕地面积，也想着使通海水从落水洞里流出去，多搞些湖田。可是，把湖水放走了，天旱时又用什么浇地呢？谁也想放通海湖水得田，谁也舍不得。合作化以后，人多力量大，群众用挖泥滇湖的办法，这几年来增加了一千多亩田。
    去年11月，云南省党代会后，?麓县县委书记栾忠同志又提出放湖水种湖田的问题。地委会也表示同意。他们普查了湖的深浅，最深的才六、七公尺。他们又研究了变大湖为小湖，再把湖底出水的泉围起来，既能放水得田，又能利用湖水浇地的方法。然后就在全县范围内展开了宣传和辩论。群众的思想马上开朗了，迅速地变成了征服自然的力量，于是几万人跑上了工地，日夜不停的干起来了。
    这天上半晌，云南高原上的劲风按时到来，通海湖水的浪头也慢慢地高起来了。来这里的人，有哪个不想着看看围龙潭（即从地下出水的眼，当地人称龙潭）啊！因为天已近午，县里的老马同志叫我们到最近的一个围潭的工地上去。万家社的同志一听说有人来参观他们的围龙潭工程，马上放下饭碗，从家拿出桨来，就摇船送我们去。
    小船顺着一条小河走了不远，就到大湖了。几只白鹭从近水处飞掠过去。风越吹越大，浪一个又一个地打过来，李力永一面摇桨一面笑着说：您看，同志！一刮风这湖里的水就浑了。为啥浑呢？这就是水浅了。放水还不到一个月，湖水就浅了一尺多，这么大片片的湖田都露出面来了。等不了多少天，就可整田插秧了。此刻，风浪比刚才更大了，两位老人划船显然更加吃力，但李力永却极力划着船往西去，他的意思是叫我们把湖西面围龙潭的工程看完，然后再转回来看东面的，他还说：既然来一次，就要把这几个地方都看完。老马同志让他们顺风把船划到东面的那个工程上，这样可以省些力气。李力永还是摇着桨往西划，并且说：好划呢，风大没有咱们的劲头大，一会就到了。老马说了好多话，才说服了这两个老汉。调转船头，划得很快，不到一个钟头就到了东面的围龙潭工地。围龙潭的工程有几亩地大，现在已被高高的木椿围了一圈，在两行木桩中间，有的地方已填满了泥土。这些建设社会主义的人们，该有多么大的毅力啊！他们从那么远的地方把土运来，在龙潭的周围围起一道墙，使龙潭水高出未来湖地的地面。现在这个工程上没有人，整个湖面上也很少有船只，这里只有红旗漫卷西风的声音，这里只有西风狂卷湖水的声音。李力永燃着烟站在船头上，看看那无际的湖水，轻声地说：再到西边看看有多好。他眼睛盯着波涛翻滚的湖在笑——大概他在想像着湖水的波浪变成金黄色谷浪时的动人景色吧！
    大约一个多钟头的时间，才从湖中心回到岸边来。吃了点饭，就急忙地到岳家营落水洞去了。通海的水要从这个水洞里流走。去年11月间我们来这里时，这里的半山坡上，还满是树木，在这样短短的时间里，它变得使人难以辨认了——现在这里堆放着大量的从落水洞里挖出的石头。我们来得正巧，大约再有半个钟头，第二个落水洞就要放水了。我们第一次来这里的时候，落水洞离湖水还很远，但急于要种湖田的人们，在这样短短的时间里，把落水洞挖深了，现在第一个落水洞正在放着水。如果第二个、第三个落水洞同时放水的话，通海的湖田，就会迅速的露出来。在落水洞未放前，曾有人怀疑：这样个大湖，水从落水洞里流出去，是否会在别的地方造成水灾？可是，落水洞放水不久，就从山那边的华宁县传来了喜讯。落水洞的水，从华宁县的一个龙潭里出来了，干涸的华宁河，也有了五寸深的水。利用这些水，同样可以灌溉不少的农田。（据林业部3月25日的统计）
