Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. Shanghai's six city-level libraries are breaking with convention by opening year-round, providing daily service, and extending reading room and lending hours. This will double the annual opening time compared to last year, equivalent to adding six new libraries of the same kind. This is one of the main contents of a competition initiative proposed by the Shanghai Library, Shanghai People's Library, and four other institutions to libraries at the provincial and municipal levels across the country on the 6th.

The six libraries also proposed to expand interlibrary loan work, increasing the number of libraries with interlibrary loan relationships from forty-six to one hundred and fifty, and replying to letters from brother libraries requesting books on the same day.

Each library will also organize more than one million accumulated duplicate books by May of this year, rapidly supporting brother libraries, while also helping suburban areas establish book circulation work and helping agricultural cooperatives establish book stations.

    上海六个图书馆倡议
    全年开放日日服务
    新华社上海7日电　上海六个全市性的图书馆打破常规，全年开放，日日服务，延长阅览和外借时间。这样全年的开放时间比去年增加一倍，等于新增加了六个同样的图书馆。这是上海图书馆、上海市人民图书馆等六个单位在6日向全国省市以上图书馆提出竞赛倡议的主要内容之一。
    六个图书馆还提出要扩展馆际互借工作，建立互借关系的图书馆从四十六个增加到一百五十个，兄弟馆来信借书的，当天答复。
    各馆还要在今年5月份内把积存的一百万册以上的复本书籍整理好，迅速支援兄弟图书馆，同时帮助郊区建立图书流通工作和帮助农业社建立图书站。
