In most parts of China, February is already springtime, but Moscow is still in the grip of a freezing winter. Every year on February 23rd, Soviet Army Day, regardless of the blizzard or the tens of degrees below zero cold, "Walruses" from all over Moscow go to the Moscow River to participate in the annual ice water swimming competition. "Walrus" is a nickname given by the Soviets to those who have bodies of steel and can swim freely in ice water.

A few days ago, on the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Army, the banks of the Moscow River were once again crowded with people. An icebreaker cleared the way for the swimmers on the snow-covered frozen river. The competition began with Fedor's water skills demonstration. He has swum in many oceans and has spent a total of 20,000 hours underwater.

Then came the swimming competition for novices. Natasha, a ninth-grade student, participated in this competition for the second time. Of course, she started training a long time ago. She started with morning exercises and rubbing her body with cold water, then practiced swimming in the late autumn weather, gradually becoming unafraid of ice water. The oldest of these novice competitors was Shatalov, a sixty-one-year-old retiree. He started exercising three years ago. He said that since then, his appetite has increased greatly, he never catches a cold, and now he is convinced of the folk saying: "Ice water cures all diseases." (Attached picture)

    “海象”游泳比赛
    二月在我国大部地区已是春天了，但是莫斯科却仍是冰封地冻的严冬。每年这个月的23日，即在苏联建军节的日子，不管这天有多大风雪或零下几十度的严寒，莫斯科各地的“海象”都要到莫斯科河上在冰水中进行每年一度的游泳比赛。原来“海象”就是苏联人送给那些体格如钢在冰水中游动自如的人们的绰号。
    前几天苏联建军四十年的时候，在莫斯科河两岸又挤满了人。一艘破冰船在白雪覆盖着的冰河上开动，为游泳家们开路。比赛开始了，首先是费多尔的水中技术表演。他在很多海洋中游泳过，到目前为止总共在水下游达两万小时了。
    然后是新手们的游泳比赛。九年级的女学生娜塔沙已是第二次参加这种比赛了。当然，她从很久以前就开始了锻炼。她从清晨作早操和用冷水擦身开始，然后练习在深秋的天气游泳，这样逐渐就不怕冰水了。这批比赛的新手中，年龄最大的是六十一岁已经享受养老金待遇的沙塔洛夫。他是在三年前开始锻炼的。他说，从那时起他的饭量大增，总也不伤风感冒，现在他已深信民间的这句俗语：“冰水破百病”。（附图片）
