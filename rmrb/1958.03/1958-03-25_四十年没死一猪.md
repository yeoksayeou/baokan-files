    Forty Years Without a Single Pig Dying
    Han Jifu is a member of the Rongxu Cooperative in Qingxi Township, Daozhen County, Guizhou Province. He has been raising pigs since he was fifteen years old, and has never stopped for forty years. He raises both sows and fattening pigs, always keeping three pigs in the pen. Since 1956, the number of pigs in the pen has increased to six. Over the past forty years, he has sold a total of 764 piglets and kept 82 pigs for fattening. Including the sows he raised, a total of 888 pigs have been produced from his pigsty, and not a single one has died. With Han Jifu's help and guidance, thirty-nine households nearby (now a cooperative) have also not had a single pig die in fourteen years. Han Jifu's experience in pig farming mainly focuses on hygiene and disease prevention. He cleans the pigsty twice a day, and after sweeping, he sprinkles hot wood ash in the pen, sweeping it away after a short while to keep the pen dry and clean. Every three to four days, he uses lime-clarified water to wash the pig troughs, feed buckets, and feeding ladles. Every ten days or so, he washes the pigs with soapy water.

    四十年没死一猪
    韩继福是贵州道真县清溪乡荣蓄社的社员，他从十五岁就喂猪，直到现在四十年里没有间断过。母猪肥猪都养，在圈猪经年总有三头，从1956年起在圈猪增加到六头。四十年来共卖出仔猪七百六十四头，自己留喂肥猪八十二头，连同喂的母猪，从他家猪圈里生产的猪共八百八十八头，却从没有死过一头。在韩继福的帮助指导下，附近三十九户（现在是一个社）十四年来也没有死过一头猪。韩继福在养猪业上的经验主要是讲卫生，防疾病。他每天打扫猪圈两次，扫后给圈里撒热草木灰，稍等片刻即扫去，使圈经常保持干燥清洁。每三、四天用石灰澄清的水洗刷猪槽、饲料桶、喂猪瓢等。每十天左右用肥皂水给猪刷洗一次。  （肖明）（附图片）
