    Let New Technologies Take Root Among the Masses
    Dongfanghong Cooperative Cultivates "Eight Specialists"
    (Our reporter from Xi'an) Since 1956, the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Yan'an County has, based on the needs of production development, successively cultivated "eight specialists." These "eight specialists" are: agricultural technicians, agricultural machinery operators, water conservancy and soil conservation specialists, forestry and horticulture specialists, health workers, midwives, veterinarians, and inseminators. The "eight specialists" have played a huge role in production.
    Since the upsurge in production appeared in 1956, people did not understand the new technologies. For example, new agricultural implements such as hillside plows and liberation-style waterwheels were purchased, but cooperative members did not know how to install, dismantle, or repair them, and some even did not know how to use them. Once, more than 400 people went to the mountains to build terraced fields, leveling a hillside into a platform, but only built two mu per day, and also removed the fertile soil, resulting in crops not being able to grow. After suffering greatly from the lack of technical knowledge, the cooperative decided to cultivate its own technicians. Mao Peixing and Fu Haicao were sent to the new agricultural implement promotion station and the soil and water conservation station to learn the use and simple repair of new agricultural implements, as well as soil and water loss control and water conservancy techniques. In the spring of 1956, under the guidance of technicians, they experimented with planting four mu of high-yield corn according to Wang Baojing's method combined with local conditions, with an average yield of 1,070 jin per mu, four times higher than the local average yield. This incident made the broad masses of cooperative members realize the importance of learning advanced technologies. From then on, the cooperative designated cooperative director Feng Changye as an agricultural technician, organized a technical night school, and invited comrades from the agricultural technology station to give a lecture once every half month. When the county's animal husbandry, health, forestry and other departments held various technical personnel training classes, the cooperative selected five members to attend.
    The "eight specialists" have played a significant role in production. Last year, all of the cooperative's more than 900 mu of flatland were planted in accordance with the dense planting experience learned by the agricultural technicians, changing from broadcast sowing to row sowing, with an average increase of 91 jin per mu. In the past, the survival rate of planted trees was only 30%. Since having forestry and horticulture specialists, 67 mu of apple trees, 20 mu of mulberry trees, and 380 mu of other trees have been planted, with a survival rate of over 90%. Now, most people in the cooperative have learned to use new agricultural implements such as hillside plows, seed drills, and three-tine weeders, and if minor problems occur, the machinery operator can repair them at any time. In the past, when the cooperative's more than 80 large female livestock were in heat, they had to be taken to the breeding station, costing three yuan for each donkey and one yuan for each cow. After the cooperative cultivated inseminators last year, one mule and thirteen calves have been born. This year, five more mules and twenty more calves are expected to be born. Health worker Gao Wenxiang carries a medicine kit when going to the fields. If cooperative members have minor illnesses or injuries during production, he provides timely treatment, greatly reducing the cooperative members' lost work time going to the city for medical treatment. Everyone happily calls him the "field doctor." (Wen Bai)

    让新技术在群众中扎根
    东方红社培养“八员”
    本报西安电  延安县东方红农业社，自1956年起就根据生产发展的需要，陆续培养了“八员”。这“八员”是：农业技术员、农业机械员、水利水保员、林业园艺员、保健员、接生员、兽医员、配种员。“八员”在生产上起了巨大作用。
    自1956年出现了生产高潮后，大家都不懂新的技术。如买了山地犁、解放式水车等新农具，社员们都不会安装、拆卸和整修，有些农具甚至不会用。有一次，四百多人上山修梯田，把一个山坡削成平台，一天只修了两亩，而且是把熟土起掉了，结果种不成庄稼。社里吃尽不会技术的苦头后，决心培养自己的技术员。将毛培兴、傅海曹派到新式农具推广站、水土保持工作站，学了使用和简单修配新农具以及治理水土流失、修水利等技术知识。1956年春，在技术员的指导下，按照王保京的办法结合当地情况试种了四亩丰产玉米，每亩平均产了一千零七十斤，高出当地一般产量四倍。这件事使广大社员认识到学习先进技术的重要。从此社里就指定社主任冯长叶为农业技术员，组织了技术夜校，每半个月请农技站同志给上一次课。县畜牧、卫生、林业等部门举办各种技术人员训练班，这个社都选派了五个社员去受训。
    “八员”在生产上起了很大的作用。去年全社九百多亩川地，一律都按照农业技术员学的密植经验，改撒播为条播，平均每亩增产九十一斤。以往栽的树，成活率只有30％，自从有了林业园艺员后，已植起苹果六十七亩、桑树二十亩、其他树木三百八十亩，成活率达90％以上。现在社里大部人都学会了用山地犁、条播机、三齿耘锄等新式农具，发生小毛病，机械员随时都可动手修理好。以前社里八十多头大母畜发情时，要拉到配种站去，每交配一头驴三元，牛一元。去年社里培养了配种员后，已配的下了骡子一头，牛十三头，今年还可下五头骡子，二十头牛。保健员高问祥下地时就背上药箱，社员有了啥小病，或生产中碰伤等，他及时给予治疗，大大减少了社员进城就医的误工。大家都高兴地称他是“田间大夫”。　　　（文柏）
