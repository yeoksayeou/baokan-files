Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 19th: Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda, when speaking to reporters today, expressed opposition to any "covert or overt interference" by foreign countries in the Indonesian situation.

Prime Minister Juanda said that there are political or armed conflicts in many Asian and African countries. He said: "If this situation is used as a reason for interference, it will only lead to the expansion of turbulent and troubled areas in Asia and Africa, making the pursuit of world peace more difficult." The Indonesian Prime Minister expressed opposition to attempts by some countries to recognize the Indonesian rebels as having "belligerent rights."

Prime Minister Juanda said that Indonesia's neighboring countries should be careful not to allow adventurers in their countries to smuggle or sell weapons to Indonesian rebels. He said: This is beneficial to the security of all of us. In this way, Indonesia can quickly stabilize, which will definitely have a positive impact on the development of the entire Asian region.

When talking about the various reactions from foreign countries to the current situation in Indonesia, Prime Minister Juanda said: First, most countries have actively stated that they are unwilling to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs; second, some countries have reminded Indonesia to be wary of the danger of foreign interference; third, one or two countries have adopted a neutral attitude and have made some explanations for this neutral attitude, and the interpretation of this explanation changes every day; fourth, foreign newspapers have reflected some of the rebel's claims, as if the Indonesian government's actions against the rebels were influenced or aided by foreign forces. Regarding this point, Prime Minister Juanda said that he felt very regretful that magazines like the American "Time" and other international magazines found it necessary to smear President Sukarno's reputation.

Prime Minister Juanda said: I can emphasize that the Indonesian people and government, politicians, and even Indonesian newspapers have a very strong sense of self-esteem and would never resort to despicable writing. The government has so far remained calm and attentive to this reaction from foreign newspapers. Every reaction is currently being considered, although the government is determined to keep its policies in line with the established guidelines.

    朱安达反对外国干涉印度尼西亚
    要求邻国不让冒险分子供应叛乱集团武器
    谴责美国宣传机器沾污苏加诺总统的名声
    据新华社雅加达19日电  印度尼西亚总理朱安达今天向记者们发表谈话的时候，表示反对外国对印度尼西亚局势进行任何“暗中或公开的干涉”。
    朱安达总理说，在许多亚洲国家和非洲国家里都有着政治冲突或者武装冲突。他说：“如果这种局势被作为进行干涉的理由，它只会导致亚非两洲的动乱地区和闹事地区的扩大，使谋求世界和平更加困难。”这位印度尼西亚总理表示反对某些国家承认印度尼西亚叛乱分子有“交战权”的企图。
    朱安达总理说，印度尼西亚的邻国应该注意不让它们国内的冒险分子把武器偷运或出卖给印度尼西亚的叛乱分子。他说：这对我们大家的安全都有好处。这样，印度尼西亚就可以迅速稳定下来，而这对整个亚洲的发展必定会有良好的影响。
    在谈到外国对印度尼西亚目前局势的各种反应时，朱安达总理说：第一、大部分国家积极声明它们不愿干涉印度尼西亚的内部事务；第二、有些国家提醒印度尼西亚要注意提防外国干涉的危险；第三、有一两个国家采取了中立态度，并且对这种中立态度作了些说明，而对这种说明的解释每天都有变化；第四、外国报纸反映了叛乱分子的一些说法，似乎印度尼西亚政府对叛乱分子采取行动是受到外国势力的影响或受到外国势力的援助似的。关于这一点，朱安达总理说，他感到很遗憾，像美国“时代”周刊和其它国际性杂志竟认为有必要沾污苏加诺总统的名声。
    朱安达总理说：我可以着重指出，不论印度尼西亚人民和政府或者政治家、甚至印度尼西亚报纸都有很强烈的自尊心，决不会采用卑鄙的笔法。对于外国报纸的这种反应，政府到现在为止仍然保持着冷静，并且加以注意。目前正在考虑每一个反应，虽然政府坚决要使自己的政策不脱离已经拟定的方针。
