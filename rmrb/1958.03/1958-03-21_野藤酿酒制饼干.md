	Wild Vine Used to Brew Wine and Make Biscuits
	In the mountains and ridges of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, a kind of wild vine resembling a grapevine grows all over the mountains and fields. In the Miao language, it is called "Bi Du Du". In Chinese, it is called "Smilax glabra". Its roots have clusters of spherical fruits, containing white starch inside. Recently, the commercial departments of the autonomous prefecture have used it to brew wine, with each hundred jin yielding fifty to sixty-four jin of fifty-proof liquor, tasting the same as ordinary white spirit. Biscuits made by mixing 50% "Bi Du Du" with flour also taste very good.

    野藤酿酒制饼干
    在湘西土家族苗族自治州的藤山峻岭中，遍山漫野都长着一种像葡萄藤似的野藤。苗语叫“比都独”。汉语叫“土茯苓”。它的根结有成串像球状的实，实里含有洁白的淀粉。最近，自治州商业部门用它酿酒，每一百斤能酿出五十度的酒五十到六十四斤，味道与普通白酒一样。用50％的“比都独”同面粉混拌制成饼干，味道亦很佳美。
