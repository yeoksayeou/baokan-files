Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 7th: According to American newspapers and news agencies, the American economic recession is further developing, and industrial and commercial activities continue to shrink. According to estimates by Harvard University's renowned economics professor Sumner Slichter, the current US Gross National Product, calculated at an annual rate, has already decreased by $11 billion compared to the third quarter of last year.

According to weekly statistics from many industrial sectors, comparing February to January of this year, steel production decreased by nearly 4%, bituminous coal mining decreased by 8%, and automobile production decreased by 17%. Comparing February of this year to February of last year, steel production decreased by nearly 43%, bituminous coal mining decreased by 20%, oil production decreased by 8%, automobile production decreased by 31%, and railway freight volume decreased by 20%.

Department store merchandise sales in the first three weeks of February this year decreased by 9% compared to the same period last year. Retail trade volume for the week ending March 1st decreased by varying degrees, from 1% to 5%, across the country compared to the same period last year.

According to newspaper materials, the downward trend in industrial production is expected to continue. The "New York Times" pointed out that most steel companies received steel orders in February that would only require them to operate at 40% to 45% of their existing production capacity to fulfill. The demand for steel and steel products has sharply decreased in major steel-using industries such as automobile, petroleum, construction, and machinery manufacturing, as well as railway transportation.

The outlook for the petroleum industry is equally pessimistic. Government measures to restrict oil imports have not eased the plight of the petroleum industry. Sales of petroleum products began to decline at the end of last year. Meanwhile, inventory of oil has rapidly increased, reaching 115 million tons by the end of last year. According to newspapers, in March, the US oil industry's production capacity in extraction will only reach 60%, and in refining, it will only reach 70%.

Although automobile production has been continuously declining, the number of unsold cars continues to increase. As of February 28th, new car inventory reached 900,000 vehicles. At the current sales level, even if all American automobile companies completely stopped production, these inventories would be sufficient to supply the American automobile market for 69 days. Some economists estimate that US automobile sales this year will decrease by 1.3 million vehicles compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 8th: According to US officials on the 7th, the number of unemployed Americans in February this year, scheduled to be released next week, will increase to 5.1 million, reaching the highest peak of unemployment in sixteen years.

US officials said that this number is more than 600,000 higher than the unemployment figure for January this year, causing many government officials to be "surprised." On the same day, the US Department of Labor announced that for the week ending February 22nd, the number of workers applying for unemployment benefits in the United States increased by 137,800, reaching 3,268,000, which is the highest figure in twenty years.

### 美国经济衰退进一步发展  工业继续减产货物严重滞销  失业人数已突破五百一十万

    美国经济衰退进一步发展
    工业继续减产货物严重滞销
    失业人数已突破五百一十万
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：据美国报纸和通讯社报道，美国经济衰退在进一步发展，工商业活动在继续萎缩。据哈佛大学著名经济学教授斯利契特估计，目前美国的国民总产值，以年率计算已经比去年第三季降低了一百一十亿美元。
    根据许多工业部门的每周统计数字，今年2月份和1月份比较，钢铁产量减少了将近4％，烟煤开采量减少了8％，汽车生产量减少了17％。如果把今年2月份同去年2月份比较，钢铁产量减少了将近43％，烟煤开采量减少了20％，石油产量减少了8％，汽车生产量减少了31％，铁路货运量减少了20％。
    百货商店的货物销售量在今年2月份头三个星期比去年同期减少9％。到3月1日为止一周的零售贸易额在全国各地比去年前同期下降了1％到5％不等。
    据报纸材料指出，工业生产的下降趋势还要继续发展。“纽约时报”指出，大多数钢铁公司在2月份收到的钢订货，只需开动现有生产能力的40％至45％就可以完成。钢的主要用户，如汽车、石油、建筑和机器制造等工业部门以及铁路运输部门对钢和钢制品的需求急剧减少了。
    石油工业部门的前景同样不堪乐观。政府采取的限制石油进口的措施，并没有缓和石油工业的处境。石油制品的销路从去年年底就开始减少。而库存的石油量迅速增加，到去年年底已经达到一亿一千五百万吨。据报纸指出，在3月份，美国石油工业在开采方面的生产能力将只达到60％，在提炼方面将只达到70％。
    虽然汽车生产在连续下降，但是卖不出去的汽车仍在增加，到2月28日为止，新车存货达到九十万辆。按照目前的销售水平，就是所有美国汽车公司完全停止生产，这些存货也足够美国汽车市场供应六十九天。据一些经济学家估计，美国今年汽车的销售量要比去年减少一百三十万辆。
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国官员7日透露，预定在下星期发表的今年2月份美国失业人数将增加到五百一十万人，达到十六年来的失业人数的最高峰。
    美国官员说，这个数字比今年1月份的失业数字增加了六十万以上，使许多政府官员都感到“吃惊”。在同一天，美国劳工部宣布：到2月22日为止的一周，美国申请失业救济金的工人增加了十三万七千八百人，达到三百二十六万八千人，这是二十年来的最高数字。
