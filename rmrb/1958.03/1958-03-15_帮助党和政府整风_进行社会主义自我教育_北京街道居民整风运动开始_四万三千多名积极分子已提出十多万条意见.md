Xinhua News Agency Dispatch – The rectification movement among street residents in Beijing has begun successively. The content of this movement mainly involves mobilizing the city's 900,000 residents to help the Party and government with rectification and to carry out socialist self-education.

The street activists who first entered the movement have already engaged in widespread airing of views, and the airing of views by the masses of residents has also begun successively. The forms of airing views are diverse, including various discussion meetings, big-character posters, and many work teams have also set up suggestion boxes, suggestion books, and conducted individual visits to collect the opinions of the masses. Due to the variety of ways to express opinions, which facilitates the masses to raise suggestions, to date, according to incomplete statistics from the six districts in the city (excluding Dongsi District), as of March 8, more than 43,900 activists had submitted more than 140,000 opinions.

The more than 140,000 opinions cover all aspects of government work, and the vast majority are well-intentioned. Many of them are opinions on the work style of grassroots work and grassroots staff. A resident named Yang from Maojiawan in Xisi District criticized that some people in the street office have no principles in handling affairs, and even gave a subsidy of 20 jin of grain to a person who was a short-term temporary resident. Several activists from the Liuli Jing office in Chongwen District posted a big-character poster, criticizing that when the police station and the office need activists to do work, they praise the activists to the skies, but after the work is completed, they leave the activists aside and rarely help educate them.

Regarding the opinions raised by residents in the airing of views, the work teams in many districts have promoted relevant units to rectify them in a timely manner. As of March 8, according to incomplete statistics from the five districts of Dongdan, Xidan, Xuanwu, Chongwen, and Qianmen, more than 38,300 of the opinions raised by residents have been rectified, and rectification reports have been made to the residents in a timely manner, which the residents have responded to very well.

    帮助党和政府整风　进行社会主义自我教育
    北京街道居民整风运动开始
    四万三千多名积极分子已提出十多万条意见
    新华社专稿　北京市街道居民整风运动已先后开始。这一运动的内容，主要是发动全市九十万居民帮助党和政府整风和进行社会主义的自我教育。
    最先投入运动的街道积极分子，已经普遍大鸣大放，居民群众的鸣放也已陆续开始。鸣放的形式多种多样，有各种座谈会，有大字报，许多工作组还设立了意见箱、意见簿，以及进行个别访问搜集群众的意见。由于鸣放方式多种多样，便于群众提意见，到目前止，据城内六个区（不包括东四区）的不完全统计，到3月8日止，四万三千九百多积极分子已经提出了十四万多条意见。
    十四万多条意见涉及了政府工作的各个方面，绝大多数都是善意的。其中有很多是对基层工作和基层工作人员工作作风的意见。西四区中毛家湾一位姓杨的居民批评街道办事处有的人办事没原则，有一个人是短期临时户口，办事处也给补助了二十斤粮食。崇文区琉璃井办事处的几位积极分子贴出了一张大字报，批评派出所和办事处有了工作需要积极分子来做时，把积极分子捧如天仙，工作完了以后，就把积极分子丢在一旁，很少帮助教育。
    对于居民在大鸣大放中提出的意见，许多区的工作组都推动有关单位及时进行整改。到3月8日止，据东单、西单、宣武、崇文、前门五个区的不完全统计，对于居民提出的意见已整改了三万八千三百多条，并及时向居民作了整改报告，居民们反映很好。
