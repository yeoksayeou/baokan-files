Small Lenses on the Great Leap Forward
High Mountains Must Bow Their Heads, Even the Holy Mother Must Give Way

"Holy Mother Forest" is located in Gansu Province. The surrounding area is characterized by steep mountains and dense forests, with a Holy Mother Temple at the foot of the mountain. Legend has it that this area is where the Holy Mother would come to cool off, and no one was allowed to touch a single tree on the mountain except to build the temple. In the past, a young farmer named Wang Jiu'er went to the forest to chop wood and was scratched by a branch. People said he had offended the Holy Mother. From then on, the Holy Mother's reputation spread far and wide, and no one dared to touch a single blade of grass or tree on the mountain.

In the magical legends, the Holy Mother forbade the people from touching the forest. However, in order to bring water up the mountain, the young people insisted on making the Holy Mother give way. Hou Degong, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in Wenquan Township and a Communist Party member, convened a youth forum to discuss the matter of cutting through the forest to open a canal. Wei Zhenchang, a controlled element, seized the opportunity to infiltrate the meeting and spread rumors, saying, "The Holy Mother is very powerful. Opening this mountain will bring death!" This immediately aroused the resentment of the youth, and many young people clamored to ask Wei Zhenchang to ask the Holy Mother what areas she controlled.

The young people vowed to cut through the Holy Mother Forest. Under the leadership of Hou Degong, twenty young men formed the Forest-Cutting Team. They collected fifty sickles and five axes, and put forward the battle cry of "We will not come down the mountain until we have cut through the Holy Mother Forest!" At the crack of dawn, the team members rushed into the Holy Mother Forest, where they wielded their sickles and axes, and the Quercus mongolica trees fell one after another. Team member Lu Shiqiang accidentally scratched his hand on a branch. Everyone advised him to rest, but he said, "It doesn't matter. Our slogan is to keep working after entering the forest!"

As dusk approached, the Forest-Cutting Team had cut a road through the Holy Mother Forest, spanning 430 meters. The Holy Mother's power, which had lasted for so many years, was swept away by the young people in a single day.

The next day, the Mountain-Opening Team entered the Holy Mother Forest early in the morning.

    大跃进中的小镜头
    高山也要低头　圣母也要让路
    “圣母林”在甘肃省境内，附近一带山陡林密，山下有座圣母娘娘庙。相传这片地方是圣母娘娘乘凉的地方，除了修建庙宇外，谁也不能动一动山上树木。过去有个农民青年王九儿，到林中砍柴，被树枝扎伤了，人们都说他得罪了圣母娘娘。从此，圣母威声远震，谁也不敢再动山上一草一木。
    在神奇的传说中，圣母不让人民动林。但是，为了引水上山，青年们却偏要圣母让路。温泉乡团支部书记、共产党员侯德功召开了青年座谈会，商量劈林开渠的事情。管制分子魏真昌乘机混进会场，散布谣言说：“圣母娘娘灵验得很，开这山就要死人哩！”当时就激起青年的愤恨，许多青年都吵嚷着要叫魏真昌问问圣母娘娘，看她管的是哪些地方。
    青年们誓要劈开圣母林，在侯德功领导下，二十名青年小伙子组成了劈林队。他们收集了五十把镰刀，五把斧头，提出了“不劈圣母林，坚决不下山”的战斗口号。天刚麻亮，队员们就冲进了圣母林，只见他们镰斧并举，青冈树纷纷倒下。队员禄世强不小心被树枝擦破了手，大家劝他休息，他说：“不妨事，咱们口号是进林不停工呀！”
    天快黑了，劈林队在长达四百三十公尺的圣母林中，劈开了一条马路。多少年来圣母娘娘的神威，被青年们在一天内扫得一干二净。
    第二天，开山队老早就开进了圣母林。
