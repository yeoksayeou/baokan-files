Blooming Everywhere, A Riot of Color

　　Since last winter, the mass movement to reform tools has unfolded in many places; it is especially gratifying that this movement is flourishing in the minority nationality areas—the Huanjiang County of the Zhuang Autonomous Region. We believe that on the basis of the continuous expansion and deepening of the mass movement to reform tools, and with the development of national industry and the improvement of the level of science and technology, it will inevitably lead to a new era of thorough technological revolution.

　　However, there are still some leading cadres who eagerly hope to replace human and animal labor with mechanization, but lack sufficient understanding of the great significance of the mass movement to reform tools in real life. Either they do not believe in the wisdom of the masses, or they look down on the reform of small tools. Under such circumstances, they naturally will not strengthen their leadership in this work.

　　The masses are the creators of real life. They have rich production knowledge and experience, and they have an urgent need to reform tools. As long as the leading cadres believe in them and organize scientific workers to participate in this work together, the movement to reform tools will surely bloom everywhere, a riot of color, creating conditions for the early realization of mechanization.

    遍地开花，万紫千红
    自从去冬以来，群众性的改革工具运动在许多地方展开了；尤其可喜的是这个运动正在少数民族地区——僮族自治区环江县蓬勃地开展着。我们相信，在群众改革工具运动不断广泛、不断深入的基础上，随着国家工业的发展和科学技术水平的提高，必将导致彻底的技术革命的新时期。
    但是，至今还有一些领导干部，他们殷切地盼望着用机械化来代替人畜力劳动，而却对现实生活中的群众改革工具运动的重大意义认识不足。他们不是不相信群众的智慧，就是看不起细小工具的改革，在这种情况下，自然不会对这项工作加强领导。
    群众是现实生活的创造者，他们具有丰富的生产知识和经验，他们有改革工具的迫切要求，只要领导干部相信他们，并且组织科学工作者一同参加这个工作，改革工具运动必将遍地开花，万紫千红，为早日实现机械化创造条件。
