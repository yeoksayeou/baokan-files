    Relatives, We Must Be Vigilant!
    Wang Jing, Family Member of a Volunteer Soldier
    I am the family member of a Volunteer Soldier. After the armistice, I took my child to Korea to visit my husband. Remembering the days I lived in Korea, it is very memorable. I love the Korean "Amani," and I love the Korean children even more. Near our residence, there were several fellow villagers whose children often played on our playground, and they gradually became familiar with my five-year-old daughter, Xiao Ping. Although the children did not speak the same language, they were so affectionate with each other. They played ball together, swung on the swings together, chased each other, and when they were happy, they would hug each other and laugh for a while. Sometimes they would come to our dormitory to play. The child would call me Mom, and the Korean children would also learn to call me Mom. I remember once when the Korean People's Army Concert Troupe came to our unit to perform for a few days. A dancer named Bae Jin-seon in the Concert Troupe, her Korean folk dance was truly captivating. Whenever Ms. Bae finished dancing, my child, Xiao Ping, would not be able to help but run onto the stage, present flowers to the auntie, and shout that the auntie danced so well. Auntie Bae would pick up the child and kiss her. When the Concert Troupe left, the unit sent them off a long way. My child held hands with the aunties, unwilling to part, tears silently streaming down her little face. Ms. Bae also shed tears...

    Relatives, now that you have returned, I hope you will never relax your vigilance. Don't become complacent just because you see the peaceful construction of our motherland. Imperialism has not given up; it is a beast. Don't forget the bomb craters in Korea! Don't forget the tears of Amani when she said goodbye! I urge you to be a hundred times more vigilant for the sake of humanity, for the happy lives of our children, and for our socialist construction. If imperialism dares to launch another war, we must give it an even greater blow.

    亲人啊，还要警惕啊！
    志愿军家属　王静
    我是一个志愿军的家属，停战后，曾经带着孩子到朝鲜去探望过我的爱人。想起在朝鲜住的一段日子，是很让人留恋的。我爱朝鲜的阿妈妮，更爱朝鲜的孩子们。在我们住房附近，有几家老乡，他们的小孩经常在我们操场上玩，慢慢的和我五岁的女儿小苹熟习了。虽然孩子们语言不通，但他们彼此是那么亲热，他们一起玩皮球，一起荡秋千，一起追逐，高兴了，他们会抱在一起哈哈大笑一阵。有时还到我们宿舍来玩，孩子喊我妈妈，朝鲜的小朋友也学着叫我妈妈。还记得有一次朝鲜人民军协奏团来我们部队演出了几天，协奏团有位舞蹈家裴金善同志，她跳的朝鲜民间舞蹈真是迷人，每当裴同志跳完，我的孩子小萍会情不自禁地跑上舞台，向姨姨献花，喊着姨姨跳的真好，裴阿姨抱起孩子亲吻。当协奏团走的时候，部队送出很远，我的孩子和姨姨们牵着手不肯分开，不声不响地在小脸旦上流着眼泪，裴同志也流了泪……。
    亲人们，你们现在回来了，我希望你们千万不要放松警惕，不要看到祖国的和平建设就麻痹起来。帝国主义还没有死心，它是野兽。你们别忘了朝鲜的弹坑！更别忘了阿妈妮送别时的眼泪！我要求你们为了人类，为了孩子们的幸福生活，为了咱们的社会主义建设，千万要百倍的警惕。如果帝国主义胆敢再发动战争，要给它更大的打击。
