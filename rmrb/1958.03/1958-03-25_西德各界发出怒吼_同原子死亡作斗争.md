Xinhua News Agency, March 24th - Over two thousand people from all walks of life in West Germany gathered in the packed "Congress Hall" in Frankfurt am Main on the 23rd for a spirited meeting to protest the Adenauer government's policy of atomic armament in West Germany. The slogan of the meeting was: "Fight Against Atomic Death!" Prominent figures from all circles attending the meeting called on the West German people to resist the policy of atomic armament in their speeches.

    The chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, demanded that West Germany reject all types of atomic weapons and refuse to establish military bases within West German territory, thereby contributing to the peaceful reunification of Germany. He also expressed his support for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe.

    The chairman of the West German Trade Union Federation, Richter, said in his speech that West German workers would stand at the forefront of the struggle against the use of nuclear weapons.

    At the meeting, writer Stefan Andres called on West German residents to oppose the West German government's decision to equip the West German army with atomic weapons, asking, "What should we do?" At this point, the crowd at the meeting shouted "General Strike!" with great enthusiasm! Slogans against atomic armament rose and fell throughout the venue.

    This gathering was initiated by the "Committee for the Struggle Against Atomic Death." This committee consists of forty-one well-known West German political figures, scientists, trade union workers, and writers, and it plans to hold a series of gatherings across the country to mobilize the masses.

    Some here believe that the Frankfurt meeting marks the beginning of the first serious setback that Adenauer has encountered since coming to power in 1948.

    In recent days, several West German trade unions, with a total membership of over two million, have been calling for a general strike to oppose equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. The "Eagle Group," the youth organization of the West German Social Democratic Party, has also called for a general strike. After West German Defense Minister Strauss demanded that the West German army be equipped with atomic weapons during the foreign policy debate in the Bundestag, the calls for a general strike have become even louder.

    西德各界发出怒吼
    “同原子死亡作斗争”
    据新华社24日讯　西德各界人士两千多人23日在美因河畔的法兰克福挤得满满的“国会大厅”里举行了一次情绪昂扬的大会，抗议阿登纳政府在西德实行原子武装的政策。大会的口号是：“同原子死亡作斗争！”出席大会的各界著名人士在发言中号召西德人民抵制原子武装政策。
    西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔要求西德拒绝任何类型的原子武器，拒绝在西德境内建立军事基地，从而对和平统一德国问题作出贡献。他还表示拥护在欧洲建立无原子武器地区。
    西德工会联合会主席里希特在发言时说，西德的工人将在反对使用核武器的斗争中站在前列。
    作家斯特凡·安德烈斯在会上号召西德居民反对西德政府用原子武器装备西德军队的决定时问道：“我们应当怎样办？”这时，到会的群众情绪激昂地高呼“举行总罢工！”反对原子武装的口号在整个会场中此起彼伏。
    这次集会是由“反对原子死亡斗争委员会”发起举行的。这个委员会由四十一个知名的西德政界人士、科学家、工会工作者和作家组成，它计划在全国各地举行一系列的集会来动员群众。
    这里有人认为，法兰克福大会是阿登纳自从1948年上台以来所遭到的第一次严重挫折的开端。
    在最近几天中，一共拥有二百多万会员的好几个西德工会都在号召举行总罢工来反对用原子武器装备西德军队。西德社会民主党青年组织“鹰团”也要求举行总罢工。在西德国防部长施特劳斯在联邦议院外交政策辩论中要求用原子武器装备西德军队以后，号召举行总罢工的呼声更高了。
