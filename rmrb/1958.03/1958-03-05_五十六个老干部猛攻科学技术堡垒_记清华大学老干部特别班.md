Fifty-six leading cadres from machinery, electricity, and other factories across the country, as well as bureau and division chiefs from relevant industrial departments of the Central Government, have launched a battle to fiercely attack the bastion of science and technology at Tsinghua University. They are all Communist Party members tempered in the storms of revolution.

They came to Tsinghua in May 1956. At that time, they were divided into Class A and Class B according to their educational level. They have now completed the courses of junior high school and senior high school, and have also learned some basic university theoretical courses. After this winter vacation, their main focus will shift to the technical science courses of mechanical manufacturing and electrical power. By the summer of 1960, each of them will master a technical science and return to the industrial front with a graduation certificate.

In the past year and eight months of study and combat, their academic performance has gradually improved, and the number of grades of five and four has increased. In the past, only three students in Class B, which had the most learning difficulties, could get a five in each exam. However, in the most recent advanced mathematics exam, 22 of the 37 students in the class received a five, and none failed. The situation in Class A is similar. In the most recent physics exam, 17 of the 19 students in the class received a five or a four.

Where there's a will, there's a way.

How did they manage to learn so much, so well, and so quickly in such a short period? When reporters asked them to talk about their experiences on this issue, they were all very modest, "Just do your best!"

Of the fifty-six of them, most had only attended junior high school in the past, and eight had not even finished elementary school. Even for the few cadres who had studied in high school, that was one or two decades ago. Therefore, their foundation was very weak. When they first came to Tsinghua University, many people did not even recognize Latin letters and some mathematical symbols, and some had such a low level of Chinese language proficiency that they could not even understand the words and sentences in university textbooks. In fact, every step they take in their studies requires them to spend a great deal of effort to make up for the deficiencies of their past education. When learning advanced physics, many problems have to be approached from the courses of junior high school. Teachers also take this into account when lecturing. Many people do not recognize the codes for physics and mathematics terms, so they compile those terms into cards and recite them repeatedly like learning a foreign language. In order to deepen their understanding of the courses, they do all the exercises in the book, even those that the teacher did not assign. Some do them not only once, but even two or three times. Some people have a low level of Chinese language proficiency, so they hold the textbooks and chew and think over them word by word, and mark the key points of each chapter and section with red lines. Ye Yin is the oldest student in the class. He asks questions of teachers who are more than 20 years younger than him like an elementary school student. If he doesn't understand something in class, he asks the teacher to explain it to him again after class. If a problem is not solved, he cannot fall asleep that day. Even if he lies down in bed, he has to get up again and think about it. When studying solid geometry and engineering courses, they are not used to deriving solid concepts from drawings. Some people hang the drawings on the bedside, and think about the drawings as soon as they lie down in bed at night. Some use small cardboard boxes or wax mud to make models to help them understand the content of the course. Many people have a small notebook in their pockets, which is full of various formulas that must be memorized, and they take them out to recite anytime, anywhere to overcome the weakness of being older and having a poor memory. For them, time is more precious than anything else, and not a single minute or second can be easily let go. Holidays and Sundays are no exception. Zhang Zhuliang's home is in Beijing, and he has rarely spent a Sunday at home since entering Tsinghua. Some people do not go home during the winter and summer vacations, and those who do go home also bring books and a large number of assignments and live a study life like they are at school.

During the winter vacation, when reporters went to visit the class, all the students who did not go home were buried in their homework. One cadre told the reporter: "Where there's a will, there's a way. Our original foundation was poor, but we believe that as long as we seize the time to catch up, even if the foundation is worse, we can make up for it."

However, they also have their own superior conditions. They use their political experience and ability to analyze and summarize problems to find a set of learning methods suitable for themselves in every link of learning. Now they don’t find learning as difficult as it was at first, and their learning efficiency has also improved a lot compared to the past. Some cadres have begun to ask for more courses to be added.

Good Teachers and Helpful Friends are Everywhere at Tsinghua

The main task of these fifty-six veteran students in their studies is to learn the technical sciences of machinery and electricity, but they have not given up on studying political theory and current affairs policies. In the past year, they actively participated in the anti-Rightist struggle, just like all university students, and then participated in many debates on major political issues. In the anti-Rightist struggle, they put out many sharp big-character posters. In the great debate, all fifty-six of them served as political counselors in various departments. Young college students come to visit them when they have difficulties in the debate. They also spend one or half a day each week studying current affairs policies. In their study plan, they will also take more time in a semester to study philosophy.

Leaders at all levels of Tsinghua University attach great importance to the teaching work of the class. The school has established a leading group headed by Vice President Chen Shihua, responsible for studying the teaching principles and teaching plans of this class, and appointed Professor Li Jixiang, the former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, to specifically serve as the head teacher of this class. Teachers with the richest teaching experience were also drawn from various departments to teach here. From now until the last semester of 1960, all the teachers needed for all courses have been designated, and they have been divided into two teaching groups according to their majors to prepare lessons. The teachers who lectured to the fifty-six of them also exerted great creativity in the previous stage of teaching and explored some teaching methods suitable for the study of these veteran cadres.

After nearly two years of practice, the Party Committee and teachers of Tsinghua University believe that veteran cadres with relatively poor cultural levels can master a scientific and technological skill after three or four years of study. Tsinghua University is already studying and preparing to run another class for veteran cadres.

    五十六个老干部猛攻科学技术堡垒
    ——记清华大学老干部特别班
    新华社记者　朱彬　朱继功
    有五十六个来自全国各地机械、电力及其他工厂的领导干部和中央有关工业部门的局处长，在清华大学里展开了猛攻科学技术堡垒的战斗。他们都是在革命的风暴中经过锻炼的共产党员。
    他们在1956年5月来到清华。当时按照文化程度的高低分为甲乙两班，现已补完初中高中的课程，也学了一些大学的基本理论课。今年寒假以后，他们的主攻方向就要转到机械制造和电力两门专业技术科学课程上来。而到1960年的夏天，他们每一个人都要掌握一门技术科学，带着毕业证书重返工业战线。
    在过去的一年零八个月的学习战斗中，他们的学习成绩逐步上升，获得五分四分的越来越多，学习困难最多的乙班学员过去在各课考试中，只有三个人能得到五分，但在最近一次高等数学考试里，全班三十七人就有二十二人获得了五分，并且没有不及格的。甲班的情况也是如此，在最近一次的物理考试中，全班十九人中有十七人获得了五分或四分。只要功夫深，铁杵磨成针
    在这样短的时间里，他们怎样做到学的又多又好又快的？当记者请他们就这个问题谈些自己的体会时，他们每个人都很谦虚，“尽自己的力量努力吧！”
    他们五十六个，多数人过去只念过初中，有八个人连小学课程也没有念完。即使曾在高中学习过的少数干部，那也是一二十年前的事。因此，他们的基础很差。初来清华大学时，不少人连拉丁字母和数学上的一些符号也不认识，有些人语文水平低到连大学课文词句也看不懂。他们在学习中每走一步实际上同时就要花很大的力量来弥补过去文化的不足。学习高等物理时，不少问题就得从学习初中的课程来着手。教师们在讲课时也照顾到这一点。许多人不识物理、数学名词的代号，他们把那些名词编成卡片，像学外文一样反复地念。为了加深自己对课程的理解，对书本上的习题，教师没有指定做的，他们也一个不漏的全部做出来。有的不仅做一遍，甚至做两遍三遍。有些人的语文水平低，他们捧住课本逐字逐句的咀嚼思考，每一章一节的重点都画上红线。叶荫是全班年龄最大的一位学员，他在比自己年轻二十多岁的教师面前也像小学生一样地提问题，在课堂弄不清楚，下课后他就请教师再为他讲一遍。一个问题没解决，当天就不能入睡，即使躺到床上，也要再起来思考下去。在学习立体几何和工程化的课程时，他们不习惯从图纸上得出立体的观念来，有的人就把图纸挂在床头边，晚上一躺到床上就对着图纸想。有的用小纸盒或腊泥做成模型来帮助自己理解课程的内容。不少人的口袋里都有一个小本子，里面写满了各种必须记住的公式，一有空就随时随地拿出来背诵，以克服年纪较大、记忆力不强的弱点。对于他们来说，时间比什么都宝贵，一分一秒的时间也不能轻易放过去。假日和星期天也不例外。张主良的家就在北京，他自进清华以来，很少在家里度过一个星期天。有些人在寒暑假里也不回家，回家的人也都带着书和大批作业过着像在校一样的学习生活。
    寒假中记者到班里去访问时，没有回家的学员们全部埋头在做功课。有一个干部对记者说：“只要功夫深，铁杵磨成针。我们原来的基础差，但是我们相信，只要抓紧时间赶，基础再差些也能补得上。”
    但是，他们也有自己的优越条件。他们运用自己的政治经验和分析总结问题的能力，对学习的每个环节都找出了一套适合自己的学习方法。现在他们学习起来已不像最初那样费劲，学习效率也比过去提高了很多。有些干部已开始要求再增加几门功课。
              良师益友遍清华
    这五十六个老学员在学习上的主要任务，是学机械、电力专业的技术科学，但是他们也没有放弃政治理论时事政策的学习。在去年一年的时间里，他们和所有的大学生一样，积极地参加了反右派斗争，接着又参加了许多重大政治问题的辩论。在反右派斗争中他们出了不少尖锐的大字报。在大辩论中，他们五十六个都当了各系的政治辅导员。年青的大学生们在辩论中有了困难就来拜访他们。他们平时每周也有一天或半天的时间用来学习时事政策。在他们的学习计划中，还将在一学期中抽出较多的时间来学哲学。
    清华大学各级领导干部，对班的教学工作都非常重视。学校成立了以副校长陈士骅为首的领导小组，负责研究这个班的教学方针、教学计划，并派原机械系主任李辑祥教授专门担任这个班的班主任。又在各系中抽出了教学经验最丰富的教师到这里来教课。从现在起直到1960年最后一学期全部课程所需要的教师都已经指定了，并且按专业分成了两个教学小组在进行备课。为他们五十六个讲课的教师们在前一阶段的教学中也发挥了很大的创造性，摸索出了一些适合这些老干部学习的教学方法。
    经过将近两年的实践，清华大学的党委和教师们都认为原来文化水平比较差的老干部，经过三四年的学习都可能掌握一门科学技术的本领。清华大学已经在研究筹备再办老干部班的工作。
