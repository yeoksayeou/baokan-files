    Promoting Production Leap Forward, Arranging People's Livelihood
    Hebei Comprehensively Inspects Grain Policy

    Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 29th. The Communist Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province are launching the masses to comprehensively inspect grain policies in conjunction with spring plowing and production, promoting the leap forward movement in production. At present, more than half of the province's more than 20,000 agricultural production cooperatives have completed the inspection work, and the policy inspection of the remaining agricultural cooperatives is also being carried out gradually. The overall grain work situation in the province is basically stable, and the masses' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high.

    The mass grain policy inspection is a profound socialist education for the masses. During the inspection, many cadres and members further understood the state's policy of increasing production without increasing purchases and using good harvests to make up for poor harvests, and automatically corrected the mistake of concealing grain and privately dividing it. According to incomplete statistics from only six counties including Ninghe and Changli, 385 agricultural cooperatives automatically reported more than 30 million jin of concealed and privately divided grain. The township and commune cadres of Matoushan Township in Yutian County once shouted that production was in deficit before the grain policy inspection, saying that the state had purchased 50,000 jin of rations, but after speaking out and debating, they not only did not want the state to supply them, but also sold more than 30,000 jin of grain. After the grain policy inspection, the broad masses also exposed and criticized some landlords, rich peasants and bad elements who took the lead in creating grain problems. During the policy inspection, shortcomings in grain work, such as individual overestimates of production and slow issuance of certificates, were also corrected, and some households with too little grain reserved were also appropriately supplemented with some grain.

    推动生产跃进　安排群众生活
    河北全面检查粮食政策
    新华社保定29日电　中共河北省各级组织正结合春耕生产发动群众全面检查粮食政策，推动了生产跃进运动。目前，全省已有约占半数以上的两万多个农业生产合作社结束了检查工作，其余农业社的政策检查，也在逐步进行。全省的粮食工作局势基本稳定，群众生产情绪空前高涨。
    群众性的粮食政策检查，对群众是一次深刻的社会主义教育。在检查中，许多干部社员进一步了解了国家增产不增购和以丰补歉的政策，自动纠正了瞒产私分的错误。仅宁河、昌黎等六县不完全统计，有三百八十五个农业社，自动报出瞒产私分粮食三千多万斤。玉田县马头山乡的乡社干部，在粮食政策检查前曾叫喊亏产，说国家多购了五万斤口粮，经过鸣放辩论以后，不仅不要国家供应，又卖出了三万多斤粮食。经过粮食政策检查，广大群众还揭发批判了一些带头闹粮食问题的地主富农和坏分子。在政策检查当中，也纠正了个别估产偏高，发证迟缓等粮食工作中的缺点，个别留粮过少的社户，还适当增补了一些粮食。
