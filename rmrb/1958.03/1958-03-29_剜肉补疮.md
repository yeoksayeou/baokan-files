Notes

    "Cutting Flesh to Mend Sores"
    The French government has recently held several round table conferences to study how to cope with the approaching storm of a large-scale economic recession. According to Gaston Defferre, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the French Senate, one of the important reasons why the French economy is facing "extremely disturbing prospects" is that the government ordered budget cuts to provide funding for the Algerian War.
    Cutting budget expenditures is a method repeatedly adopted by Gaillard to cope with the financial crisis. In his own words, this is a "surgical" policy.
    Indeed, for France, a "surgical" policy is needed. Some Western newspapers have compared the Algerian War to France's "festering sore." This is because the war not only brought French finances to the brink of bankruptcy, but also caused a political crisis in France. However, how did Gaillard perform this "surgery"? In order to preserve the "festering sore" of the Algerian War, he did not hesitate to sacrifice necessary expenditures such as economic investment and social welfare. Such "cutting flesh to mend sores" will, of course, only make France's economic situation worse and worse.

### “剜肉补疮”

    “剜肉补疮”
    法国政府最近连续召开几次圆桌会议来研究怎样应付日益迫近的大规模经济衰退的风暴。据法国参议院财政委员会主席加斯乐·贝莱诺说，法国经济之所以会面临“极端令人不安的前景”，重要原因之一是由于政府下令削减预算开支来为阿尔及利亚战争提供经费。
    削减预算开支，是盖伊阿为了应付财政危机而一再采用的办法。用他自己的话来说，这是一种“开刀”政策。
    的确，对于法国来说，“开刀”政策是需要的。有些西方报纸就曾经把阿尔及利亚战争比作法国的“烂疮”。因为，这场战争不但使法国财政濒于破产，而且使法国的政局危机重重。但是，盖伊阿是怎样“开刀”的呢？他为了把阿尔及利亚战争这个“烂疮”保住，竟不惜牺牲经济投资、社会福利等必要的开支。这样“剜肉补疮”，结果当然只会使法国的经济状况越来越糟糕了。
