    Agricultural Science Work Supports Agricultural Production
    Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Convenes Great Leap Forward Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, at a meeting in Beijing to organize a Great Leap Forward in agricultural science, decided that, under the principle of ensuring the continuation of certain necessary internal research work, it would immediately draw two-thirds of its personnel from its various specialized institutes to form six scientific work teams, which would depart before April 5th. These work teams will work under the leadership of the local Party committees and governments, in accordance with local plans. They will separately go to areas of high yield and abundance, low-yield areas, and mountainous areas to summarize experience in increasing production and study the key to increasing production, and will also investigate and study plant disease and pest control, livestock and poultry breeding and disease prevention, and the improvement of agricultural machinery and tools.
    This meeting lasted eight days and concluded on the 25th. The meeting focused on discussing how agricultural science could achieve the various tasks stipulated in the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, the main points of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences' work in 1958, and how to promote the technological reform of China's agriculture and the modernization of China's agriculture. The meeting held that agricultural science research institutions should formulate Great Leap Forward plans, and mobilize all agricultural scientific and technological forces to implement large-scale alliances and large-scale collaboration with relevant parties. In terms of experimental research methods, three fasts should replace three slows, that is, fast discovery of problems, fast research of problems, and fast resolution of problems. Agricultural scientific research work must follow the mass line, resolutely implement the policy of combining scientific research, education, and production; strengthen the responsibilities of grassroots research units; promote collective creation and comprehensive research; and combine agricultural scientific research work with the experimental field activities of the vast number of cadres in agricultural cooperatives.
    The meeting also discussed strengthening the Party's leadership over agricultural science work and opposed the tendency of agricultural science workers not to ask about politics. The meeting demanded that all agricultural science workers, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the Party's policies on agricultural science work. It required Party member responsible cadres to cultivate experimental fields, put in hard work to learn and master agricultural science knowledge, and achieve the goal of being both red and expert, red to the core and expert in depth.
    Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, spoke at the meeting. He said that at present, on the agricultural science front, there is a struggle between two roads, socialism and capitalism, and between two methods, more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. It is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of agricultural science serving the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, as well as the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. It is necessary to criticize all ideas that are divorced from production, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses, criticize setting production against science, believing that agricultural science workers should not study problems raised in production, that studying problems in production reduces the level of science, that agricultural science can only serve future production and cannot serve current production, and the erroneous ideas such as despising the experience of farmers in abundant harvests.
    Liu Ruilong said that after this stage of the rectification movement, many new atmospheres have emerged in agricultural science research institutions: the socialist consciousness of scientific workers has been raised to an unprecedented level, and many people have expressed that they want to give their hearts to the Party and their knowledge to the people; many agricultural scientists have realized that only by going into mass production can there be creation, and only by being with the masses can scientific research have a way out, and can they effectively transform themselves and achieve being red to the core and expert in depth; many agricultural science research units have put forward the slogan of hard work for three years, transforming thinking, reforming agricultural science work, supporting the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and realizing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural science. He encouraged agricultural science workers to persist in these.

    农业科学工作支援农业生产
    中国农业科学院召开大跃进会议
    新华社26日讯　中国农业科学院在北京召开的组织农业科学大跃进的会议，决定由农业科学院在保证继续进行某些必要的内部研究工作的原则下，从所属各专业所中立即抽调三分之二的人力，组成六个科学工作队，在4月5日前出发。这些工作队都在当地党委和政府领导下，按照当地计划进行工作。他们将分别到高额丰产区、低产区和山区总结增产经验和研究增产关键，并调查研究植物病虫害防治、家畜和家禽饲养与防疫、农业机器及农具的改进。
    这次会议开了八天，已在25日结束。会议着重讨论了农业科学如何提前实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案所规定的各项任务，1958年农业科学院工作要点，以及如何促进我国农业的技术改革、促进我国农业的现代化问题。会议认为，农业科学研究机构要订出跃进规划，并动员一切农业科学技术力量与有关方面实行大联合、大协作。在试验研究方法上要以三快代替三慢，就是发现问题快、研究问题快和解决问题快。农业科学研究工作必须走群众路线，坚决贯彻科学研究、教育和生产相结合的方针；加强基层研究单位的责任；提倡集体创造和综合研究；农业科学研究工作与农业社广大干部的试验田的活动结合起来。
    会议还讨论了加强党对农业科学工作的领导问题，反对农业科学工作者不问政治的倾向。会议要求全体农业科学工作者，在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党在农业科学工作上的方针。要求党员负责干部一定要搞试验田，下苦功夫学习和掌握农业科学知识，达到又红又专红透专深的目的。
    农业部副部长刘瑞龙在会议上讲了话。他说，目前农业科学战线上正在进行社会主义与资本主义两条道路、多快好省与少慢差费两种方法的斗争。必须坚决贯彻执行农业科学为农业生产大跃进服务、以及多快好省的方针，必须批判各种脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的思想，批判把生产与科学对立起来，认为农业科学工作者不应当研究生产中提出的问题，研究生产中的问题就降低了科学水平，农业科学只能为将来的生产服务而不能为当前生产服务，以及鄙视农民丰产经验等错误思想。
    刘瑞龙说，经过这一阶段的整风运动，农业科学研究机构内出现了许多新气象：科学工作者的社会主义觉悟空前提高，许多人表示要把心交给党，把知识交给人民；许多农业科学家觉悟到只有到群众生产中去才能有创造，只有和群众在一起，科学研究才有出路，才能有效的改造自己，达到红透专深；许多农业科学研究单位提出了苦战三年，改造思想，改革农业科学工作，支援农业生产大跃进，实现农业科学大跃进的口号。他鼓励农业科学工作者把这些坚持下去。
