    Beijing Construction Enterprises Take "Nantong" as Their Teacher
    (Our reporter Sun Guang reports) The experience of Nantong City Construction Engineering Company in running enterprises diligently and thriftily has had a tremendous impact on Beijing's construction enterprises. In the past, company managers and section chiefs would take cars when they went out, but now many people are riding bicycles. Almost all construction site directors, Party secretaries, and some technical personnel have moved out of the office buildings and into the work sheds to eat, live, and work alongside the workers.
    On March 11th, the Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau convened a conference attended by more than 3,400 cadres from Beijing's urban construction enterprises, and invited the manager of the Nantong City Construction Engineering Company to give a report. Everyone who heard this report felt they had received a profound education. Immediately afterwards, the Engineering Bureau held an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, and various construction companies also held employee representative meetings to disseminate the information. Many people took the initiative to examine their thinking at the meetings. The Party Secretary of the Third Construction Engineering Company, when examining his thinking, said: After becoming the Party Secretary, I always felt that I wouldn't look the part without a woolen suit, so I made two woolen suits as soon as I joined the company, and from then on, I became estranged from the workers, and I didn't even want to hold my children when I went home. Some managers who came from worker backgrounds said that when they first started leading work, they would still ride bicycles to construction sites, but later when there were cars to ride, they stopped going to construction sites altogether, and forgot their roots. Some cadres said during their self-criticism that they seemed not to be wholeheartedly running the enterprise well, but were instead acting like officials. Under the influence of the cadres, the workers also examined their thoughts of seeking shortcuts.
    Through the examination, the atmosphere in each company has greatly changed. The Beijing Fourth Construction Engineering Company originally had four cars, and is now preparing to hand over three of them. The Sixth Construction Engineering Company has five cars, and is also preparing to hand over most of them. Many leading cadres take buses when they can, and ride bicycles when they can. The Party Secretary and all the construction site directors of some companies have already moved to the construction sites to live with the workers. The Fourth Construction Engineering Company originally had more than 300 cadres, using more than 3,000 square meters of building space as offices, and now they are preparing to hand over half of it to the state. Some cadres have suggested that they should work in the office when they have something to do, and go to the construction site to work when they have nothing to do. When the workers heard that the cadres were going to participate in labor at the construction site, they all eagerly volunteered to take them on as apprentices. The workers of the First Construction Engineering Company guaranteed to help the manager learn a skill. Some guard squads suggested that they could help nail nails at the construction site when they had nothing to do. The correspondents also suggested that they should go and nail nails when they had nothing to do. The cooks suggested that as long as it was for work, they could provide hot meals at any time. The staff of the clinic also broke with convention, guaranteeing to see patients at any time and to wash bed sheets, gauze, and work clothes themselves. Fifteen technicians at the construction site of the Sixth Construction Engineering Company proposed to save the state 9,000 taels of gold by the end of the year through reviewing blueprints, proposing rationalization suggestions, and implementing administrative measures. The amateur repair factory organized by the young workers of this company has recently repaired 180 brick holders and 20 bulldozer boxes.

### 北京建筑企业以“南通”为师

    北京建筑企业以“南通”为师
    本报讯　记者孙光报道：南通市建筑工程公司勤俭办企业的经验，在北京市建筑企业里发生了巨大的影响。过去公司经理和科长出门都坐汽车，现在很多人都骑起自行车来了。几乎所有工地主任、党委书记和个别技术人员已经搬出办公大楼，到工棚去和工人同吃、同住、同劳动。
    3月11日，北京市建筑工程局召开了北京城市建筑企业三千四百多名干部参加的大会，请南通市建筑工程公司经理作报告。听过这个报告的人，都感到受了一次深刻的教育。紧接着，工程局又开了党委扩大会议，各个建筑公司也都召开了职工代表大会，进行传达。很多人在会上主动检查思想。第三建筑工程公司的党委书记，在检查思想的时候说：当了党委书记，总觉得没有呢子衣服不像话，所以一进公司就做了两套呢子衣服，从此就和工人疏远了，回家连孩子也不愿抱了。有的工人出身的经理说，开始做领导工作的时候，还骑自行车下工地，后来有汽车坐了，连工地也不去了，忘本了。有些干部在检查的时候说，自己好像不是在全心全意地把企业办好，而是在做官。工人在干部的影响下，也检查了自己找邪门的思想。
    通过检查，各个公司的风气大为转变。北京第四建筑工程公司原来有四辆小汽车，现在准备上交三辆。第六建筑工程公司有五辆，也准备大部分上交。很多领导干部有事能坐公共汽车的坐公共汽车，能骑自行车的骑自行车，有的公司党委书记和所有的工地主任都已经搬到工地和工人同住。第四建筑工程公司原来有三百多干部，用三千多平方公尺的楼房作办公室，现在他们准备把一半交给国家。有的干部提出，平时有事在办公室工作，没事就下工地干活。工人们听说干部要下工地参加劳动，都争先恐后地收徒弟。第一建筑工程公司的工人们保证帮助经理学会一门技术。有的警卫班提出，没事的时候，帮工地敲洋钉子。通讯员也提出，没事的时候也去敲洋钉。炊事员提出：只要是为了工作，不管什么时候都能吃到热饭热菜。医务室的工作人员也打破常规，保证有病人随时看，自己洗床单、纱布、工作服。第六建筑工程公司工地有十五个技术人员，提出通过审查图纸、提合理化建议和执行行政措施，到年底保证给国家节约九千两黄金。这个公司的青年工人组织的业余修理工厂，最近已经修好了一百八十个砖托和二十个推土箱。
