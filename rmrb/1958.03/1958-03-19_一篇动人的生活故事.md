    A Moving Life Story

    I very much enjoy reading those true-to-life stories in the newspaper.
    The report "Last Words of Advice, Old Matters to be Handled in a New Way" in the "Small Moments in the Great Leap Forward" column on the fourth page on March 1st, gripped my heart even more tightly. The event itself has a moving power, and it also reflects the new spiritual outlook of the uncles and elders in my hometown, so I feel particularly close to it. When I was studying in my hometown, I knew Grandpa Liu Ruiqing. From the report, I read his dying wishes: to handle all matters from the perspective of the cooperative's interests, and to increase strength for production. I deeply feel that we in the factory should do the same, that everything should proceed from the interests of the people. But some people still can't do this completely; they ask for leave for even small matters, and if it's not approved, they are full of complaints. In his will, Grandpa Liu Ruiqing also instructed his grandson to work diligently and participate actively in labor competitions, as that is true filial piety. Doesn't this already show that the old man who took the lead in breaking with convention is walking ahead of us?
    I also thank Teacher Guo Chengqing (I studied with him) for writing this very good report about the moving events in his hometown.

    一篇动人的生活故事
    我很喜欢读报上那些真人实事的生活小故事。
    3月1日第四版上“大跃进中的小镜头”专栏里“临终赠良言，老事要新办”那篇报道，更紧紧地抓住了我的心。这事件的本身就有感人的力量，它又反映了我家乡叔叔大爷们的新的精神面貌，所以我感到特别亲切。我在家乡读书的时候，就认识刘瑞清老大爷。从报道中读到他临终遗嘱：办一切事情要从合作社的利益出发，为生产增加力量。我深深感到，我们在工厂更应当这样，一切要从人民的利益出发。可是有的人还不能完全这样做，为了一点小事也要请假，如不被准许，就牢骚满腹。刘瑞清老大爷在遗嘱里还嘱咐他的孙子在外安心生产，积极地参加劳动竞赛，才是真正的孝顺。这不已经说明带头打破常规的老人，走在我们的前面了吗？
    我还谢谢郭澄清老师（我跟他念过书），他把家乡动人的事情写成这篇很好的报道。
