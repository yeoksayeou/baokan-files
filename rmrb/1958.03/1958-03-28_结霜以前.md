    Before Frost
    When issuing cold wave warnings, meteorological observatories often say: "...cold air will invade the ×× area, ..., after the weather clears and the wind stops, frost (or frost damage) is expected in the area in the early morning…". Why does frost (or frost damage) only appear after the weather clears and the wind stops?
    At night, the temperature of the lower-level air decreases due to ground radiation cooling. The intensity of radiation is closely related to weather conditions. If the sky is covered with dense clouds, the ground radiation heat dissipation will be greatly reduced, or even stop. In this case, the heat in the air cannot be dissipated and has to be stored in the atmosphere, which will inevitably affect the decrease in ground temperature. This shielding effect of the cloud cover on heat dissipation is like putting a large roof on the sky, hindering and suppressing the upward transfer of heat.
    On clear nights, the temperature distribution of the air with height is often like this: the air near the ground is particularly cold, while in the air tens or hundreds of meters above the ground, the temperature is higher than that of the ground. The existence of such a temperature distribution of warm air above and cold air below in the atmosphere is called a "temperature inversion layer" in meteorology. Because this inversion layer is formed by ground radiation, it is also called a "radiation inversion".
    When the wind force increases, it often causes large-scale air disturbances, mixing the warm and cold air above and below, and the radiation inversion layer is destroyed. As a result, the cold air cannot continue to stagnate in the lower layer. Conversely, the temperature of the air near the ground has increased somewhat due to the mixing of warm and cold air above and below. Obviously, this is not conducive to frost formation. Therefore, generally speaking, when a certain area is newly invaded by a cold wave, due to the special weather of hazy skies and strong winds at the forefront of the cold wave, the decrease in the surface temperature of the ground is not very drastic. Only when the cold air has occupied the sky above the area, with clear skies and weak winds, is the temperature dropping sharply, and frost (or frost damage) is most likely to form on the ground.

    结霜以前
    气象台在发布寒潮时常说：“……冷空气将侵入到××一带，……，天晴风停以后，预计清晨该区将有霜（或霜冻）……。”为什么要天晴风停后，才有霜（或霜冻）出现呢？
    在夜间低层空气的温度因地面辐射冷却而下降。辐射的强弱，是和天气条件密切关联的。如果天空云层密布，这时地面辐射散热就会大大减弱，甚至趋于停止。这样，空气中的热量得不到消散，只得仍旧被贮藏在大气层里，势必影响了地面温度的下降。这种云幕对散热所起的挡蔽作用，正像给天空盖上了一个大屋顶似的，它阻碍和压制着热量向上的传递。
    晴朗夜间，空气的温度随高度的分布常是这样：近地面层的空气特别冷，而在离地面约几十公尺到一、二百公尺的空中，它们的温度反而比地面的要高。大气中存在这样的上暖下冷的温度分布，气象学上称它是“逆温层”，因为这种逆温层是由于地面辐射所形成，因此也叫它是“辐射逆温”。
    当风力增强时，往往引起了大规模的空气扰动，使上下暖冷空气混合起来，辐射逆温层被破坏。结果冷的空气无法继续停滞在低层。相反的，近地面层空气的温度因上下暖冷空气的混合，却有了一些增高。显然这是不利于成霜的。所以一般说来，某地区当它刚刚受到寒潮的侵袭时，由于寒潮前沿具有的阴霾天空和风力强猛的特殊天气，地的表面温度的降低倒并不是很巨剧的，只有当冷空气已占领了该地的上空，这时碧空万里，风力微弱，才是温度猛降、在地面最容易结霜（或霜冻）的时候。
