Xinhua News Agency, 27th. According to TASS on the 26th: Ukraine, the famous granary of the Soviet Union, had its largest total harvest of winter wheat in 1957 in the past forty years. Ukraine produced more wheat than Canada, and almost as much as the total wheat production of France, Belgium, West Germany, Spain, Austria, and the Netherlands combined. Last year, its collective farms and state farms sold 1.9 million tons more grain to the state than in 1956. This year, Ukraine's grain production is expected to increase by 10% compared to last year.
