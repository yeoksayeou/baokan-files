Xinhua News Agency, March 14th. The People's University of China is using the form of a student and teacher representative conference to mobilize the masses to sweep away the "five airs" and thoroughly destroy bourgeois ideology, providing experience for cooperating with big-character posters to accelerate the movement towards greater depth.

After the Double-Anti Movement at People's University started on the 7th, 150,000 big-character posters were put up in five days, exposing the waste of manpower and material resources throughout the university. In order to guide the movement in depth, on the 11th and 13th, the entire university held student and teacher representative conferences in two locations, inside and outside the city. The conferences focused on digging out ideological roots and exposing the "five airs" that existed in various aspects. Students criticized teachers, teachers criticized leaders, and also conducted self-criticism, while leading cadres took the initiative to "ignite the fire on themselves," and some also joined everyone in exposing problems. Everyone's speech listed facts, naming names and speaking frankly. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of democracy and unity from beginning to end. Those who were criticized felt they had gained a lot, and those who criticized also benefited greatly.

Many representatives pointed out that arrogance from above is the main obstacle to the progress of People's University at present. This arrogance is prominently manifested in teaching work, sticking to conventions, not paying attention to linking with reality, and turning a blind eye to dogmatism. To date, the main courses of many departments still use materials left by Soviet experts three or four years ago, which do not contain any practical information or achievements from China. As a result, students in the Department of Agricultural Economics do not understand the management methods of Chinese rural cooperatives. Law students do not understand the patterns of domestic general civil and criminal cases. Archive students do not know about the new achievements in domestic archival work in the past two years.

Arrogance is manifested in the significant development of bourgeois individualism in many cadres and teachers. Everyone focused on criticizing some veteran party members for their tendency to deviate from politics. Some of them are department heads or teaching and research section directors, but in the past two years they have not been interested in the collective work of the school and are not responsible for teaching work. Many people do not teach courses but are busy with their own "side businesses." In their view, "work is for everyone, but business is for myself." They always say they are too busy to teach courses or write lectures. Several teaching and research sections in the History Department have been dragging on for several years without compiling a textbook. When the head teacher of the Marxist-Leninist Philosophy Research Class fell ill, none of the three directors of the Philosophy Department were willing to come out to act as a proxy to preside over the teaching work of this class. Some teachers do not prepare in advance for class because they are busy with personal "side businesses," and talk nonsense in class. Some teachers even lock the door and leave during tutoring time. This style of work is even more serious among young teachers. Some are also not united in the pursuit of fame and profit.

When these problems were exposed at the representative meeting, people felt the importance of carrying out the Double-Anti Movement in depth. Many teachers and students took the stage and asked everyone to aim their criticism at themselves. They said that in order to leap forward, they must first thoroughly destroy bourgeois ideology. Many people felt that their thinking had broadened and their eyes were brighter. Some people were concerned before the meeting that such face-to-face sharp criticism at the conference might damage their personal prestige, but the revolutionary fire of the conference eliminated these concerns. In addition to criticism and exposure, there were also many initiatives at the meeting. Some people immediately started to improve what could be improved after the meeting. Some teachers went to the students to understand their thoughts and requirements and write new lectures.

    展开面对面的批评　大破资产阶级思想
    人民大学师生代表会是好经验
    本报特约新华社14日讯  中国人民大学采用师生职工代表会的形式发动群众横扫“五气”，大破资产阶级思想，为配合大字报加速运动向纵深发展提供了经验。
    人民大学的双反运动7日开始后，五天时间里就贴出大字报十五万张，这些大字报揭发了全校人力物力上的浪费。为了把运动引向深入，11日、13日全校在城内城外分两处举行了师生职工代表会，会上集中力量挖思想根，把各方面所存在的五气挖出来了。学生批评教师，教师批评领导也进行自我批评，而领导干部纷纷引火烧身，有的也和大家一起揭发问题。每个人的发言都列举事实，指名指姓开门见山。会议自始至终洋溢着民主、团结的气氛。被批评者感到很有收获，批评人的人也深得教益。
    许多代表都指出自上而下的骄气是人民大学目前前进中的主要障碍。这种骄气突出地表现在教学工作上墨守成规，不重视联系实际，对教条主义熟视无睹。不少系的主要课程到目前为止都沿用着苏联专家三、四年前留下的材料，里面根本没有中国的实际情况和成就。以至农业经济系的学生不懂得中国农村合作社的经营管理方法。学法律的学生不懂得国内一般民刑案件发生的规律。学档案学的学生不知道国内近两年档案工作上的新成就。
    骄气表现在许多干部和教师身上的是资产阶级个人主义有了显著地发展。大家着重批评了一些老党员有脱离政治的倾向。他们有的身为系主任、教研室主任，可是近两年来对学校集体工作不感兴趣，对教学工作不负责，许多人不开课而忙于搞自己的“副业”。在他们看来：“工作是大家的，业务是自己的”。请他们开课、写讲义总是推说忙。历史系有几个教研室拖了几年还没把一部教材编出来，马列主义哲学研究班的班主任病倒了，哲学系三个主任竟没有一个肯出来代理主持这个班的教学工作。有的教师因为忙个人“副业”，上课事先就不准备，到了课堂上天南地北的乱扯。有的教师到了辅导时间竟把门一锁走开了。这种作风在青年教师中更严重。有的还为了争名争利闹不团结。
    在代表会上人们揭发到这些问题时，就感到要把双反运动深入开展下去的重要。不少教师和学生都上台要求大家把锋芒对准自己。他们说要跃进，就先彻彻底底破资产阶级思想。许多人都感到思路开阔了，眼睛更亮了。有些人会前曾顾虑到这样面对面的在大会上进行尖锐的批评，可能有损个人威信，但大会上人们革命的烈火把这些顾虑消除了。会上除了批评和揭发外，还有许多倡议。有些人散会后就立即把可改进的着手改进。有的教师到学生中间去，了解学生的思想和要求，编写新的讲义。
