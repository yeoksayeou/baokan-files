    This Newspaper reports Tsinghua University faculty and students have widely opened the door to criticism and self-criticism. As of the morning of the 25th, the total number of big-character posters in the university had increased to more than 2.6 million. In order to further deepen the movement, the Party Committee and the university administration held座談会 for all professors in five groups on the evening of the 23rd.

    The professors freely discussed their initial understandings and gains, believing that the "Double-Anti" movement was coming on strong, igniting the flames of criticism and self-criticism. Most problems were exposed, marking a great ideological revolution. Professor Jin Xiwu believed that one of the characteristics of this movement was its sheer quantity, eliminating all blind spots. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, everyone had passive sentiments, and not everyone actively participated. But this time everyone is actively participating. Professor Wang Zonggan spoke of his mood during the movement: the night before the mobilization meeting, I wrote a lot of big-character posters, but on the first day I became a "super-large watermelon" myself, and I felt uncomfortable, very heavy-hearted, and under a lot of pressure. Because of the bad mood, I couldn't write any more big-character posters. Later, I thought of a conversation with a comrade from the Ministry of Higher Education, and understood that the movement should not only compare quantity but also quality, but also attitude, and then I understood. Professor Chen Liangsheng said that when he first picked up a watermelon, he felt a little uncomfortable, but after digesting it, he felt confident. He felt very comfortable after writing the self-criticism that morning.

    Professor Gao Lianpei felt that mass criticism was like a searchlight, exposing everything when it shone on it. Intellectuals have an inexplicable sense of self-importance. When criticized, they always feel uncomfortable and want to refute, but later, after thinking about it, they feel that it is a bit right, and eventually they will admit that it is right. Therefore, taking the mass line is very successful. Professor Zhang Mingtao's experience is: when a person contemplates behind closed doors, he wants to continue when he is happy, and he gives up when he is unhappy. It is easy for his thoughts to wander off, and he wants to avoid the painful points. To completely solve the problem, he must be determined to thoroughly expose the problem and ask everyone for help in analyzing and criticizing it. Professor Wu Zhonghua also realized that the most important thing is the greatness of the masses' power, and to transform one's ideology well, one needs to "maintain the power of the masses." Professor Ai Weichao felt that the movement in the past few days has opened up a situation of criticism and self-criticism. He said: I was a student of Mr. Zhang Mingtao more than 20 years ago, and I have never given him any opinions until now. We always say that we want to carry out criticism, but we never seem to be able to carry it out. After passing the first hurdle this time, we can establish a new relationship with each other. Professor Shi Jiayang felt that through the movement in the past few days, his ideology has taken a step forward towards socialism. He usually thinks about his own bourgeois ideology, but not very deeply. This time, the comrades set up a watermelon stall for me, the problem is clear, and the harvest is great. Professor Chu Shi-chuan also used the example of the teaching and research group to illustrate how mass criticism promoted the work of the engineering drawing teaching and research group. He said that in the past, everyone was not at ease in their work, and the quality of teaching was very low, but he still did not admit it. After this exposure, the students sent a large number of watermelons, and then he admitted that the work was not done well, and did not complain about being "overqualified". This aroused everyone's sense of responsibility and promoted everyone's determination to be both red and expert.

    Everyone said that although the movement has achieved great success, we cannot relax our efforts, and we must carry it out more deeply. Professor Cheng Shi said that this is like stewing beef, first cooking it over high heat, and then simmering it over low heat, it will become more fragrant. Professor Lang Shijun believes that many of the problems raised by everyone are superficial phenomena. Without in-depth analysis and finding out the key, it is easy to swallow it whole. Therefore, this is just the beginning, and the next stage of work is still very arduous. Professor Xia Zhenhuan said: "There are certain limitations to giving opinions in writing. We can sit down and talk and make the problems more thorough." Professor Wang Guozhou said: "Some problems require heart-to-heart talks in small groups, and big-character posters are not enough. For example, the unity problem of the four comrades in the wood structure group has existed for a long time and should be discussed." Professor Gao Jingde believes that we should start breaking and building at the same time, on the one hand, deeply analyzing the exposed problems, and on the other hand, considering red and expert planning.

    President Jiang Nanxiang made a speech at the end of the meeting. He said: This movement is like mining. Now the ore has been mined, and the work to be done is refining; concentrating on some issues for in-depth analysis and planning to consolidate the achievements of the big-character posters.

    思想改造需要群众烈火
    清华大学教授座谈双反心得
    本报讯　清华大学师生大开批评与自我批评之门，到25日早晨，全校大字报增加到二百六十多万张。为了进一步深入开展运动，党委会和校行政特于23日晚分五组召开全校教授座谈会。
    教授们畅谈了自己的初步体会和收获，认为这次双反运动来势猛，烧起了批评与自我批评的火焰，大部分问题都揭露出来了，是一个思想大革命。金希武教授认为，这次运动的特点之一是数量多，消灭了死角。三反时大家有被动情绪，不是每一个人都主动参加。而这次大家都积极参加。王宗淦教授谈了他在运动中的心情：动员大会的前一天晚上，我写了不少大字报，但第一天我自己变成了“特大西瓜”，就觉得不好受，心情很沉重，压力很大。由于情绪不佳，大字报也写不下去了。后来想到和高教部一位同志的谈话，理解到运动不仅要比数量比质量，还要比态度，也就想通了。陈梁生教授谈到，刚拣到西瓜时，有些不舒服，但消化后，就感到有了信心。这天上午写完检查，心里很舒服。
    高联佩教授感到，群众性的批评有如探照灯，一照就原形毕露。知识分子有一种莫名其妙的自高自大，受到批评，开始总是不舒服，总想反驳一下，到后来想一想，就觉得有点对，最后又会承认是对的。所以走群众路线是很成功的。章名涛教授的体会是：一个人闭门思过，高兴就想下去，不高兴就算，思想很容易开小差，到痛处就想躲过。要彻底解决问题，就得下决心把问题透彻地暴露出来，请大家帮助分析批判。吴仲华教授也体会到最重要的是群众力量的伟大，要改造好思想，需要“维持一个群众的力量”。艾维超教授感到，几天来的运动打开了批评与自我批评的局面。他说：我二十多年前做过章名涛先生的学生，一直到现在，从来未向他提过意见。我们老提要开展批评，但老开展不起来。这次过了第一关，彼此就可以建立新的关系。施嘉炀教授感到，通过几天来的运动，自己思想向社会主义跃进了一步。自己的资产阶级思想，平时也想到，但很不深刻。这次同志们给我摆了西瓜摊，问题清楚，收获很大。褚士荃教授还用教研组的例子说明，群众性的批评如何推动了工程画教研组的工作。他说，过去大家工作不安心，教学质量很低，而自己还不承认。经过这次揭发，同学送来大批西瓜，就承认工作没做好，不埋怨“大材小用”了。这就激起了大家的责任心，促进了大家要又红又专的决心。
    大家都谈到，运动虽然取得了很大成绩，但还不能松劲，更要深入地开展下去。程式教授说，这有如炖牛肉，先是大火烧，然后小火炖就越香。郎世俊教授认为，大家提的问题很多都是表面现象，不深入进行分析，找出关键所在，就容易囫囵吞枣。因此，现在还只是个开始，下一阶段的工作还是很艰巨的。夏震寰教授说：“书面提意见有一定局限性，可以坐下来谈一谈，把问题弄得更透些。”王国周教授说：“有些问题要开小组会谈心，仅靠大字报还不够。例如木结构小组四位同志的团结问题，长期存在，应该谈一谈才好。”高景德教授认为目前应该开始边破边立，一方面深入分析揭发出来的问题，同时也要考虑红专规划。
    蒋南翔校长在会议结束时讲了话，他说：这次运动好比开矿，现在矿砂开出来了，再要做的工作就是提炼；集中在一些问题上深入分析，进行规划，以巩固大字报的成绩。
