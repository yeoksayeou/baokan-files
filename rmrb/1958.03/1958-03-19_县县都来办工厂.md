Rural Electric Stations

    Every County Should Run Factories
    This is a small power station model designed for rural areas by the Beijing Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. This power station has a power supply capacity of 240 kilowatts. If it is all used for pumping water, it can pump more than 5,000 tons per hour, which is equivalent to the water output of 100 three-horsepower electric wells. Used for lighting at night, it can supply 15,000 fifteen-watt light bulbs, which can meet the needs of an area with a population of 20,000 to 30,000. The power station uses 10 tons of coal per day. Where there is no coal, wood or rice husks can be used as fuel. The fuel and labor cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity is a total of four cents. The annual cost of a fifteen-watt light bulb is about one yuan. The power station only needs one vertical steam engine and one four-ton boiler. Only thirty workers are needed for day and night power generation. The power station investment is about 189,000 yuan.
    The bungalow on the right of the model is an auxiliary building, the building is a power generation room and boiler room, the coal yard is in front of the building, and the fountain pool is behind.

    县县都来办工厂
    这是水利电力工业部北京设计院为农村设计的一种小型电站模型。这种电站的供电能力为二百四十瓩，如都用来抽水，每小时可抽五千多吨，相当于一百口三马力电井所出的水量。晚上用来照明，可供一万五千个十五瓦的灯泡用，能满足二万到三万人口的地区需要。电站每天用煤十吨，没有煤的地方，可以用木柴或谷糠作燃料。每瓩小时电的燃料和人工费用共四分钱，一盏十五瓦电灯，每年用费一元左右。电站只要一台立式蒸汽机和一台四吨锅炉。日夜发电只需三十个工人。电站投资约十八万九千元。
    模型右边平房是附属建筑，楼房是发电间和锅炉间，楼房前面是煤场，后面是喷水池。
