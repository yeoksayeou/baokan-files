Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The congratulatory telegram from the State Council to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Congress reads as follows:

To the First Session of the First People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region:

On the occasion of the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, we extend warm congratulations to the Congress and the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi.

The Zhuang people are the most populous ethnic minority in our country and a nation with a rich tradition of revolutionary struggle. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region shows that the unity and cooperation among all ethnic groups in the socialist motherland have become more consolidated and developed. This is a major event in the political life of the Zhuang people and the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and it is also another significant achievement of the Party and the state in continuing to successfully resolve domestic ethnic issues through the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy.

After achieving great victories in the cause of socialist revolution and construction, as well as in the nationwide rectification campaign and the struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements, the people of all ethnic groups in our country, in order to achieve the goal set by the Party Central Committee of catching up with or surpassing Britain in steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer, in order to realize the Draft National Agricultural Development Program, and in order to implement the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily with "more, faster, better, and more economical" results, have already exerted revolutionary efforts and set off a great production upsurge. Now, the people of all ethnic groups are in an unprecedentedly favorable situation of a comprehensive great leap forward in the national economy. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at this time is of great significance. We firmly believe that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in such a favorable situation will, through the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups themselves and through three years of hard work, enable the Autonomous Region to complete the Draft National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, and enable the output value of the Autonomous Region's local industry to catch up with the output value of agriculture in a short period of time, thereby changing the face of the Autonomous Region in a short period of time and further improving the material and cultural life of the people. "Joint labor creates, joint revolutionary struggle" is the common tradition of the Zhuang, Han, and other ethnic groups in Guangxi. After the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi should greatly promote this tradition, further strengthen the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, jointly exert revolutionary efforts, brave the wind and waves, compete with each other, and bravely advance with full confidence to build a happy socialist life. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, all aspects of the work of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will surely make a great leap forward, and the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi will surely make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the great motherland.

    人大常委会和国务院电贺广西僮族自治区成立
    新华社5日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会致广西僮族自治区人代会的贺电。文如下：广西僮族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议：
    广西僮族自治区的成立，是我国实行民族区域自治政策的光辉成就。我们深信，广西僮族自治区各族人民必将和全国人民一道鼓足革命干劲，在伟大的社会主义事业中获得更大的胜利。祝大会圆满成功。

    新华社5日讯　国务院致广西僮族自治区人代会的贺电，文如下：广西僮族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议：
    当此广西僮族自治区成立之际，特向大会和广西各民族人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    僮族是我国少数民族中人口最多和富有革命斗争传统的一个民族。广西僮族自治区的成立，表明社会主义祖国大家庭中各民族的团结合作关系更加巩固和发展了，这是僮族人民和我国各民族人民政治生活中的一件大事，也是党和国家运用民族区域自治政策继续圆满地解决国内民族问题的又一重大成就。
    我国各民族人民在社会主义革命和建设事业以及全民整风运动和反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争中，取得伟大胜利之后，为了实现党中央提出的在十五年或者更多一点时间内在钢铁及其他主要工业生产品方面赶上或者超过英国，为了实现农业发展纲要草案，为了贯彻“又多、又快、又好、又省”的勤俭建国方针，已经鼓起革命干劲，掀起了一个大生产高潮，现在，各民族人民正处在国民经济全面大跃进的空前有利的形势下。正当这个时期，成立广西僮族自治区是有重大意义的。我们深信，广西僮族自治区在这样有利的形势下成立，必将经过各民族人民自己的努力，苦干三年，使自治区提前完成农业发展纲要草案，使自治区的地方工业产值在不长的时间内赶上农业的产值，因而在短期间内改变自治区的面貌，并且更加改善人民的物质文化生活。“共同劳动创造，共同革命斗争”，是广西僮族、汉族和其他各民族共同的传统。广西僮族自治区成立以后，广西各民族人民应该大大地发扬这个传统，更进一步加强各民族的团结合作，共同鼓起革命干劲，乘风破浪，互相竞赛，信心百倍地为建设社会主义的幸福生活而奋勇前进。我们深信，在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，广西僮族自治区各方面的工作一定会大跃进，广西各民族人民对伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业一定会作出更大的贡献。
