    "Those who strive can also be like this"
    Wen Ying
    The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, with a "latecomer advantage," has brought its product quality up to and beyond Shanghai's level, ranking first in the country. This is a gratifying phenomenon on the industrial front.

    A region with no history of enamel industry, and a group of non-expert leaders who came from the military, have been able to catch up with and surpass the master's technical level in a short period. This fully demonstrates that a non-expert can completely become an expert; this greatly encourages all enterprise leading cadres to learn and master production technology with full confidence.

    Learning cannot be relaxed for a single day: sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you retreat. A person who doesn't understand the business will naturally encounter many difficulties in leading an enterprise. However, if he can study hard, strive to be the best, and personally work with the workers to research and experiment with production technology, then he will slowly transform himself from a non-expert to an expert. Conversely, if you don't pay attention to learning regularly, don't strive for progress, not to mention achieving the goal of being both red and expert, red to the core and deeply specialized, even those who were "red" in the past will slowly lose their color, and those who were "expert" in the past will have their skills left behind by time and become outdated.

    Of course, a region or unit with a weak production base and poor production technology conditions will naturally face more difficulties in catching up with advanced regions and units. However, as long as the leading cadres put down their airs and study technology together with the workers, take the difficulties in production as conditions to spur themselves on, and encourage everyone to learn more modestly and fight against difficulties; at the same time, humbly absorb the beneficial experience of advanced units and sincerely listen to opinions from all sides, then it is not unattainable for backward units to catch up with advanced units.

    Mencius said: "Everyone can become Yao and Shun." "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Those who strive can also be like this." These words should be an encouragement to those who are lagging behind: the key is whether you have the determination and perseverance to catch up.

    “有为者，亦若是”
    文英
    西安人民搪瓷厂以“后来者居上”的姿态，使该厂的产品质量赶上和超过了上海的水平，跃居全国第一位。这是工业战线上的一个可喜的现象。
    一个历史上从来没有搪瓷工业的地区，一些拿枪杆子出身的外行的领导人员，能够在短短的时期内，赶上了师傅，并且超过了师傅的技术水平。这件事情充分说明了外行完全可以变成内行；这件事情大大鼓舞了所有的企业领导干部信心百倍地去学习和掌握生产技术。
    学习是一天也不能松懈的：逆水行舟、不进则退。一个不懂业务的人去领导企业，他所遇到的困难自然很多。但是如果能拼命苦学，力争上游，亲自动手，和工人一道来研究试验生产技术，那末，自己慢慢地便从外行变为内行。与此相反，如果不经常地注意学习，不努力力求进步，不用说达不到又红又专、红透专深的目标，就是过去曾是“红”的人，也会慢慢失掉颜色，过去曾经是“专”的人，他那一点儿技术，也会被时间抛在后面变成时代的落伍者。
    当然，一个生产基础薄弱、生产技术条件差的地区或单位，要赶上先进地区和单位，困难自然会更多一些。但是，只要领导干部放下架子，和工人一起钻研技术，把生产上的困难，作为鞭策自己的条件，激励大家更加虚心学习，向艰难困苦作斗争；同时，虚心地吸取先进单位有益的经验，诚恳地听取来自各方面的意见，那末，落后的单位赶上先进单位并不是高不可攀的。
    孟子说：“人皆可以为尧舜”。“舜何人也，予何人也，有为者，亦若是”。这些话，对于落后者应该是一个鼓励：问题的关键在于有没有决心，有没有毅力赶上去。
