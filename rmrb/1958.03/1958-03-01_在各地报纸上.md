In Local Newspapers

From Xinjiang News

"Go all out, leap forward, complete ten-year targets in one year!" This is the title of the headline news on the front page of the Xinjiang Daily on the 17th, and it is also the slogan of the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture's initiative to launch a competition with the four special districts (prefectures) of Urumqi, Hami, Korla, and Bayingoleng. According to this initiative, the total grain output of Changji Autonomous Prefecture in 1958 should be doubled, the average yield per mu should reach 461 jin, an increase of 92.6% over last year, so that Changji and Urumqi counties "cross the Yellow River", and Miquan county "cross the Yangtze River", so that the prefecture will achieve the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule. The Xinjiang Daily said in the editor's note that the bold leap forward initiative of Changji Autonomous Prefecture raises a question that other special districts and autonomous prefectures with natural conditions that are not bad or even superior should consider: Can they respond and challenge?

Digging Dry Wells to Store Rainwater

A water conservancy construction movement based on digging dry wells to store rainwater has formed a huge upsurge in the Yulin Special District. Before the Spring Festival, 300,000 dry wells were completed in the district, and nearly 30,000 more were under construction. These dry wells store rainwater, which can solve the difficulty of water use for humans and animals in many high mountain, plateau, and deep well areas, and turn 450,000 mu of dry land into semi-irrigated land. The Shaanxi Daily on the 26th published this news and published a short commentary saying: Among all the difficulties, the biggest obstacle is people's thinking. The farmers in Yulin Special District completed 300,000 dry wells in more than a month in the severe cold season when the ground was frozen, which once again tells people: "It depends on human effort."

Xia County's Greening Takes Flight Again

Xia County, Shanxi Province, which is famous for its achievements in planting trees around houses, villages, roads, and rivers, has put forward a new goal: to strive to achieve the requirements of Article 21 of the National Agricultural Development Program during the second five-year plan. The slogan is to consolidate the advanced, make breakthroughs in the backward, and comprehensively achieve greening. The task is to completely complete the planting of trees around houses, villages, roads, and rivers in two years under the requirements of standardization and standardization, and to realize greening throughout the territory in five years. The Shanxi Daily on the 25th reported this news on the front page and published an editorial, putting forward a resounding slogan for greening throughout the province: Each cooperative should afforest hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of mu, and each household should plant ten, one hundred, or one thousand trees.

"Flying Train"

The Wenhui Daily on the 27th reported on a piece of good news in the battle against conservatism in Shanghai under the title "Flying Train": The experimental express direct train from Shanghai to Nanjing completed the entire 312-kilometer journey in three hours, fifty-two and a half minutes, completing a historic feat. This time is 69 minutes shorter than the current Shanghai-Nanjing special express train. The Wenhui Daily cheered for this "speed of the heroic era" in the editor's note.

156 Technical Night Schools

In order to carry out the agricultural technology revolution, Jiangkou County, Guizhou Province, has established 156 technical night schools, aiming to have a technical night school in every cooperative and a technician in every team, and is preparing to open training classes for women's agricultural tools. The Guizhou Daily on the 21st published this exciting news. The news said that after the agricultural technology backbone training class in Jiangkou County ended on January 23 this year, all the county's agricultural technology cadres were assigned to the cooperatives. At present, more than 3,600 people are studying in 156 night schools, including veteran farmers, as well as young people and women. The teaching of these technical night schools is generally closely integrated with current production, and they learn what they do according to the season.

Inner Mongolia's Industrial Great Leap Forward

The local industry in Inner Mongolia, like other regions, is also making a great leap forward with each passing day. The Inner Mongolia Daily on the 25th reported that their total output value of local industry this year will increase by 37.79% compared with last year. At the recent local industry conference, it was proposed that during the second five-year plan, the output value of local industry should catch up with and exceed the total output value of agricultural and animal husbandry production. For example, it is required that the quality or cost of more than a dozen products such as five-horsepower coal-burning steam engines, low-pressure boilers, automobile repair and assembly, jacquard carpets, and ephedrine should catch up with or exceed the advanced levels at home and abroad. At present, a heated competition for advancement is underway here.

More Than 20,000 Individual Households Joined Cooperatives

The Liaoning Daily published this news on the front page on the 27th: After Liaoning Province launched a socialist debate in rural areas, by the end of January, another 23,600 individual farmers in 41 counties and cities across the province had joined cooperatives, accounting for 80% of the total number of individual households in the province, and the rest were still applying to join the cooperatives. This shows that the superiority of cooperation has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Although Xiuyan County suffered a severe drought last year that had not been seen in a century, all 210 cooperatives in the county still increased production, and the output even exceeded the highest historical output by 9%. However, Zhou Yutang, an individual farmer in Longtan District of the county, although he had two strong laborers and two cattle, could not withstand the drought and only got 60% of the crops. He said to the cooperative director:
"I've had enough of being an individual, absorb me into the cooperative, I want to work in the cooperative for the rest of my life."

    在各地报纸上
    来自新疆的消息
    “鼓足干劲、飞跃前进、十年指标、一年完成”，这是17日新疆日报一版头条新闻的标题，也是昌吉回族自治州倡议同乌鲁木齐、哈密、库尔勒、巴音郭楞四个专区（州）展开竞赛的行动口号。根据这个倡议，昌吉自治州1958年内，粮食总产量要翻一翻，平均亩产量要达到四百六十一斤，比去年增长92.6％，使昌吉、乌鲁木齐两县“过黄河”，米泉一县“跨长江”，全州提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。新疆日报在编者按语中说，昌吉自治州这一大胆跃进的倡议，给其他自然条件并不差或者还要优越的专区和自治州提出了一个应加考虑的问题：能不能应战和挑战？
    打旱井蓄天水
    以打旱井蓄天水为主要方法的兴修水利运动，在榆林专区形成巨大高潮。全区在春节前打成旱井三十万眼，还有近三万眼在开口施工。这些旱井蓄存天水，可以解决许多高山、高原、深井地区人畜用水的困难，使四十五万亩旱地变成半水地。26日的陕西日报登载了这个消息，并发表短评说：在所有困难当中，最大的阻碍是人的思想。榆林专区农民在冰封地冻的严寒季节，用一个多月时间打成旱井三十万眼，这一事实再一次告诉人们：“事在人为”。
    夏县绿化展翅再飞
    以四旁绿化成绩著名的山西夏县，又提出新的目标：争取在第二个五年计划期间，实现农业发展纲要中第二十一条的要求。口号是巩固先进，突击落后，全面实现绿化。任务是在标准化规格化的要求下，二年彻底完成四旁绿化，五年实现绿化全境。山西日报25日一版报道了这条消息，并发表社论，对全省绿化提出响亮的口号：每社造林百亩千亩万亩，每户栽树十株百株千株。
      “飞行列车”
    27日文汇报以“飞行列车”为题，报道了上海猛攻保守战斗中的一项捷报：从上海到南京的实验性快速直达车以三小时五十二分半的时间跑完三百一十二公里全程，完成了历史性的创举。这个时间比目前上海—南京特别快车缩短了六十九分钟。文汇报在编者的话中，为这种“英雄时代的速度”欢呼。
    156所技术夜校
    贵州省江口县为了进行农业技术革命，已成立技术夜校一百五十六所，要作到社社有技术夜校，队队有技术员，并准备开办妇女农具手训练班。21日的贵州日报刊登了这个令人兴奋的新闻。新闻中说，今年1月23日江口县的农业技术骨干分子训练班结束后，就把全县农业技术干部下放到社，到目前在一百五十六所夜校中学习的有三千六百多人，其中有老农，也有青年和妇女。这些技术夜校的教学，一般都紧密结合当前生产，根据季节，做什么就学什么。
    内蒙古工业大跃进
    内蒙古的地方工业，也和其他地区一样在日新月异的大跃进。25日的内蒙古日报上，报道了他们今年地方工业总产值将比去年增长37.79％。并在最近召开的地方工业会议上，提出了在第二个五年计划期间，地方工业产值赶上和超过农牧业生产总值。如要求五马力锅驼机、低压锅、汽车修配、提花毯、麻黄素等十几种产品质量或成本，要赶上或超过国内或国际的先进水平。目前这里正在各地展开热火朝天的比先进运动。
    两万多单干户入了社
    27日辽宁日报一版刊登了这样一条消息：辽宁省在农村开展社会主义大辩论后，到1月下旬，全省四十一个县市又有二万三千六百多户单干农民加入了合作社，占全省单干户总数的80％，其余的还在纷纷申请入社。这说明合作化的优越性已深入人心。岫岩县去年虽遭到百年未遇的大旱灾，但全县二百一十个社仍然社社增产，产量还超过历史上最高产量的9％。而该县龙潭区单干户周玉堂，虽然有两个硬劳力和两头牛，却没有抗住旱灾，只得了六成庄稼。他对社主任说：
  “单干的瘾可算过够了，吸收我入社吧，我要在社里干一辈子。”
