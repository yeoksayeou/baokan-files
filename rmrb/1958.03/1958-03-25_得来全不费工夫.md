A Shanghai newspaper, in order to criticize the "extravagance" and "spoiling" of nurseries, sent a reporter to search high and low and finally found a factory nursery where the government subsidized each child 31 yuan per month. But upon returning to the newspaper office and checking, they discovered that their own newspaper's nursery required a government subsidy of 52 yuan per child per month. As a result, this criticism had to be dropped.

The problems this reveals may be numerous, but the most important is the lack of self-awareness. What many big-character posters expose is not only unheard of to people outside the unit, but also unseen by colleagues within the unit! There are always problems within one's own unit, and although these problems may not be the most serious compared to similar units, digging into them will bring great surprise. After being surprised, solutions can be found.

    得来全不费工夫
    上海的一家报纸为了批评托儿所的“阔气”和“娇气”，派记者找来找去，找到了一个机器厂的托儿所，公家每月要给每个孩子补助三十一元。但回到报社一了解，才发现自己社的托儿所每个孩子每月要公家补贴五十二元，于是这个批评只好不发表。
    这件事能说明的问题也许很多，但重要的还是说明了对自己的不了解。许许多多大字报所揭发的，其实何止本单位以外的人是闻所未闻的，对本单位同志来说又何尝不是见所未见的呢！自己单位的问题总是有的，虽然这问题在同类单位中并不一定是最严重的，但挖一挖，也会大吃一惊的。吃惊之后，也就会找出解决的办法来。（臣）
