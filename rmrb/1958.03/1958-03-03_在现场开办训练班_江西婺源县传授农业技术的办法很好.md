Running Training Classes On-Site
Jiangxi's婺源 County's Method of Imparting Agricultural Technology is Very Good

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) According to Jiangxi Daily, the婺源 County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently adopted the method of running "on-site training classes" in advanced areas to impart advanced technologies. This method is much better than the previous method of centralized training in the county.

Based on the experience of successfully testing 400 mu of complex close planting in 1957,婺源 County decided to promote 300,000 mu of single-season complex close planting on 330,000 mu of land this year. However, apart from the cadres and masses in the赋春 Agricultural Cooperative demonstration area who had mastered this advanced rice cultivation method, the masses in other areas were not familiar with it. In order to impart this advanced technology, the婺源 County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held two sessions (each lasting ten days) of technical training classes at the赋春 Cooperative, which had achieved large-scale successful trials of complex close planting, from mid-January to early February, specifically training 2,437 cooperative directors, production team leaders, and group leaders.

The training method was as follows: An exhibition of the technical reform experience of the赋春 Cooperative was held, and trainees were organized to visit the fields, attend lectures and discussions. Local farmers were invited to explain the various questions raised by the trainees during their studies and introduce their struggles against various conservative ideas during the promotion of complex close planting. This series of facts convinced even those who had previously held conservative ideas. They said, "This time it's for real." On this basis, members of the赋春 Cooperative demonstrated in the fields and led the trainees in practical operations, so that what they learned was remembered more firmly, enabling them to speak about it and do it.

After completing their training, these trainees continued to conduct technical training work in their local areas.庆源 and other townships have already trained more than 700 technical personnel on their own. The County Committee plans to have these trainees, before transplanting, use the method of one teaching ten, and ten teaching a hundred, in stages, to impart the technology to 30,000 farmers, accounting for 40% of the county's farmers, so that they can basically master this technology.

### 在现场开办训练班  江西婺源县传授农业技术的办法很好

    在现场开办训练班
    江西婺源县传授农业技术的办法很好
    本报讯　江西日报消息：中共婺源县委最近采取在先进地区开办“现场训练班”的方法，传授先进技术。这种办法，比过去采取在县里集中训练的办法好得多。
    婺源县根据1957年全县试验四百亩复式密植成功的经验，决定今年在全县三十三万亩土地上推行三十万亩一季复式密植，但是，除赋春农业社示范区的干部和群众掌握了这种水稻先进栽培方法外，其它地区群众都不熟悉，为了传授这种先进技术，中共婺源县委自1月中旬至2月上旬在复式密植获得大面积试验成功的赋春社举办了两期（各为期十天）技术训练班，专门训练了二千四百三十七名社长、生产队长、组长干部。
    训练的方法是：举办了赋春社技术改革经验展览会，组织学员到田里参观，进行讲课、讨论，请当地农民讲解学员在学习中提出的各种问题，介绍他们推广复式密植时与各种保守思想进行斗争的经过。这样通过一系列事实，使原来一些有保守思想的人心服口服，他们说：“这回是真的了。”在这个基础上，由赋春社社员到田间表演，带领学员进行实地操作，使学到的东西记的更牢，做到能讲、能作。
    这些学员训练完毕回去后，又在当地继续进行技术训练工作，庆源等乡已自行训练了技术手七百余人，县委计划全县在插秧前，通过这些学员采取一传十、十传百的方法，分期将技术传授给三万名农民，使占全县40％的农民基本掌握这一技术。
