    Self-Made “Substitute Cement”
    Various places in Henan have come up with many ways to make "substitute cement," which has solved the problem of cement supply for a large number of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects under construction.
    There are three kinds of raw materials for making substitute cement: One is made of red brick powder (or burnt red earth) 65-70 jin, lime 25-30 jin, and gypsum 2-5 jin. The red brick powder or red earth should preferably be made of soil with high viscosity, low sand content, and no impurities. One is made of household-burned coal ash (without raw coal), lime, and gypsum, mixed according to the above ratio. According to tests, this kind of substitute cement has greater binding strength than the former. One is made of sandy gravel, lime, and gypsum, mixed in the same proportion, and the binding strength is even greater. The manufacturing method is: heat the red brick blanks or coal ash sandy gravel to 600-800 degrees, then mix it with lime and gypsum, wait for it to solidify, and grind it into fine powder (the finer the better), and you will have substitute cement.

    自制“代水泥”
    河南各地出现了自制“代水泥”的不少办法。解决了大量兴建中、小型水利工程的水泥供应问题。
    自制代水泥的原料有三种：一是用红砖粉（或烧过的红土）六十五一七十斤，白灰二十五—三十斤，石膏二—五斤的比例配合而成。红砖粉或红土以用粘性大，沙性少，不带杂质的土为好。一是用家庭烧过的煤灰（不夹杂生煤块）、白灰、石膏，照上述比例配合而成。据试验，这种代水泥凝结强度较前一种大。一是用砂礓石、白灰、石膏，依同一比例配合，凝结强度更大一些。制造的方法是：把红砖坯或者煤灰砂礓石，加温至六百——八百度，然后和白灰、石膏，俟其凝固后，辗成细粉（越细越好），即成代水泥。　（长青）
