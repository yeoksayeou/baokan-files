Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 12th. The "Pravda" newspaper published on the 12th the replies of Comrade Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to some questions raised by the editorial department of the Polish "People's Tribune."

The questions were posed to Khrushchev on March 10th by Broniarek, a member of the editorial board of the "People's Tribune," and Lutoski, the "People's Tribune" correspondent in Moscow.

Referring to high-level meetings, Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government's recent proposal to convene a high-level meeting with the participation of heads of government has received enthusiastic support in various countries around the world. It can be said with confidence that if a high-level meeting can be held and mutual understanding can be achieved, then this meeting will greatly help to further ease international tensions and help to establish greater trust between countries with different social systems.

The Soviet Union Agrees to Hold a Meeting of Foreign Ministers in Order to Expedite the Convening of a High-Level Meeting

In response to the question of the progress made since the Soviet government accepted the French government's proposal to hold a meeting of foreign ministers, Khrushchev said that we have already stated our attitude on this issue in the recent letter from the Soviet government to US President Eisenhower and in the memorandum. We accepted the proposal of French Foreign Minister Pineau to hold a meeting of foreign ministers to prepare for a high-level meeting because we take the attitude that any method that can expedite the convening of a high-level meeting and is beneficial to the cause of peace is good. Therefore, we advocate using all avenues, as long as they truly help prepare for this meeting. But we are worried that diplomatic channels will turn into endless exchanges of documents and endless negotiations.

For those politicians who oppose arranging meetings, non-public talks through diplomatic channels are very beneficial, because the people will know nothing about holding talks in this way, and the newspapers will not reveal any news.

I repeat, we are not opposed to negotiations through diplomatic channels. We advocate negotiations that are conducive to preparing for a high-level meeting. But once we find that diplomatic channels and non-public talks cannot bring about the early convening of the meeting, but instead hinder the convening of the meeting, then we will refuse this method. We believe that this is not as good as agreeing to hold a meeting of foreign ministers, because foreign ministers' talks must have a definite date and must be held publicly. If the foreign ministers' talks break down and fail to reach an agreement on mutually acceptable agendas and other procedural issues, then everyone can see: what is the attitude of this country and what is the attitude of that country for such foreign ministers' meetings. At that time, the public will be able to distinguish and judge: who truly supports the high-level meeting of heads of government and who opposes this meeting. If the foreign ministers' talks lead to the failure of the high-level meeting, then everyone will be convinced that the Soviet government's representatives were right to say to the public that the foreign ministers' meeting had little chance of realizing the hopes of the people of all countries for the meeting. Of course, it should be noted that the current social pressure is extremely strong. Even if some ministers are fundamentally opposed to stopping the "Cold War," they will have to take some positive steps under the pressure of public opinion. If this pressure is further strengthened, they will have to consider public opinion.

The Meeting of Foreign Ministers Should Not Discuss Substantive Issues and Cannot Replace the High-Level Meeting

Of course, positive decisions may also be made at the meeting of foreign ministers. From our side, we will do everything possible to make the meeting of foreign ministers a success. But we believe that foreign ministers should not discuss substantive issues, and their job is to prepare and arrange government head talks in an organizational aspect. If all the substantive issues are discussed at the meeting of foreign ministers, then what is the point of holding a high-level meeting?

The "People's Tribune" representative asked: We believe that if you and Comrade Bulganin can go to Washington to attend the highest-level meeting, it will leave a deep impression on everyone.

Khrushchev said that we take into account that the US President is difficult to leave the country due to a series of circumstances. We are also prepared to go to the United States to attend the highest-level meeting. In our opinion, the distance between Moscow and Washington is not terrible: we can have breakfast at home, have lunch on the plane, and have dinner in the United States.

As long as the mature issues can be resolved as the people of the world expect, for the cause of peace and to ensure coexistence, we agree to go anywhere to attend high-level meetings.

The Increasingly Strengthened Unity of the International Communist Movement is the Highest Expression of the Fraternal Alliance of Workers of All Countries

In answering the question about the development of mutual relations between communist and workers' parties in various countries in the past two years, Khrushchev said that the relations between communist and workers' parties in various countries, like in the past, have been constantly developing and strengthening in the past two years on the basis of the principles of proletarian internationalism. Communist parties in various countries call on the people of all countries to unite and struggle for peace and socialism. Therefore, communist parties in various countries strive to maintain close ties and unity of action. At the same time, each party is a completely independent political party in political and organizational terms, representing the interests of the working class and working people of its own country as well as the national interests of its own country. The internationalist interests and national interests of the working class and all working people are not contradictory, but on the contrary, they are harmoniously combined. Communist parties in various countries have always regarded strengthening the international unity of the proletariat as their sacred duty and resolutely opposed all attempts to weaken the unity of the international workers' movement.

Now it can be said with satisfaction that the unshakable unity of the international communist movement, which has been particularly strengthened in recent years, is the highest expression of the fraternal alliance of workers of all countries. This unity is not achieved spontaneously. It has been forged by communist and workers' parties in various countries in the struggle against imperialist reactionary forces and revisionists who attempt to create divisions in the world communist movement.

The enemies of the working class hope to provoke "complications" in the relations between fraternal parties, especially between fraternal parties of socialist countries. For these purposes, they attempt to exaggerate the difficulties in the process of socialist construction and exploit some local misunderstandings in the mutual relations of socialist countries. Naturally, such misunderstandings may exist, because what is now being formed is a completely new type of relationship that is unprecedented in history. However, experience shows that all problems in the mutual relations of socialist countries are being resolved through comrade-style discussions on the basis of strict adherence to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and can be resolved.

Naturally, this situation does not satisfy the enemy, who hope that the people of socialist countries will quarrel with each other. This would be beneficial for them to realize their long-cherished wish of restoring the capitalist system in the people's democratic countries. For example, everyone knows that the imperialist reactionaries have strived to use the Hungarian incident and the difficulties in Poland's road of socialist construction to achieve their goals. If some people once doubted whether the Hungarian incident was manufactured by imperialist forces, then now everyone is very clear about who is the instigator and abettor of the fascist bandits in Hungary.

The enemies of socialism have clamored wildly, and are still clamoring, saying that there is some "special situation" in Poland, and that Poland has some tendency to deviate from the socialist path. Can the working people willingly hand over their socialist fruits to the enemy? Can they willingly allow the capitalist order to be restored in socialist countries? Can they let the factories belong to a small group of capitalists again, and let the land return to the hands of landlords and rich peasants?

It is very obvious how vain and absurd the dream of the representatives of international reactionaries to restore capitalism in socialist countries is!

It is very clear that the Polish working people absolutely cannot allow the rule of capitalists and landlords to be restored. They are closely united around the Polish United Workers' Party, overcoming all difficulties, and they will continue to advance confidently along the road of socialist construction in the future. It is impossible to pull back such a country, whose people have embarked on the path of socialism and are working to build a new society without the rich and the poor, without exploitation of man by man, without unemployment and poverty. And now, when every socialist country has the help and support of the entire powerful socialist camp as its backing, it is especially impossible to do so.

The socialist camp is constantly growing and consolidating. Not long ago, the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties was a testament to this. The results of this meeting showed the world how absurd the imperialist propagandists' talk of a "communist crisis" and the like was. This meeting meant a great victory in ideology and politics for the world communist movement and workers' movement. The two declarations unanimously adopted by the representatives of the fraternal parties are documents with tremendous mobilizing power, and they prove the unity of communist and workers' parties in the struggle for socialism and world peace.

The Enemy's Attempt to Sabotage the Friendship Between the People of the Soviet Union and Poland is Doomed to Failure

Referring to Soviet-Polish relations, Khrushchev said that the friendship and cooperation between People's Poland and the Soviet Union has always been developed and is still being developed on the basis of the Leninist principles of proletarian internationalism and mutual assistance, on the basis on complete equality and mutual respect for each other's interests. The friendship between our two peoples has withstood many severe tests.

The enemies of socialism spare no effort to seize on our old grievances and find some dark sides in the history of relations between our two countries that are unfavorable to the friendship between our two peoples. They exploit nationalist sentiments and attempt to provoke them. All attempts by our enemies to sabotage the friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples are doomed to failure, because our two peoples clearly know that if the friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union no longer exists, it will only be beneficial to our enemies.

The Soviet Union has always followed the tested great Leninist principles in its relations with Poland and with all other socialist countries. We have always advocated developing the fraternal relations between our two countries, fully respecting the interests of our two peoples, developing mutually beneficial trade between Poland and the Soviet Union, expanding cultural, sports and other ties as much as possible, helping and supporting each other in the common struggle for socialism, and advocating the closest cooperation between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Polish United Workers' Party. The people of the Soviet Union and the people of Poland both understand that the closer the friendship between them, the closer the friendship between the countries of the socialist camp, the more consolidated our countries will be and the less opportunity there will be for any enemy to take advantage of, and the stronger the power of the new socialist world will be, and the more consolidated world peace will be. The great strength of the countries of the socialist camp lies in their friendship and unity. We should always keep this firmly in mind.

The cooperation between our two countries in the struggle for lasting peace and against the threat of a new world war is developing remarkably effectively. The Polish government's support for the recent Soviet diplomatic measures, and the Soviet government's support for the Polish government's valuable initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, especially prove this point.

Khrushchev said, I am deeply convinced that the fraternal friendship, mutual assistance and comprehensive cooperation between Poland and the Soviet Union, as well as all socialist countries, will definitely be increasingly consolidated and developed in the future, to benefit our two peoples and to consolidate world peace.

In the conversation, Khrushchev also talked about the achievements of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy in the past two years, as well as the great achievements and development prospects of Soviet science and technology. At the same time, he also talked about the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

### 赫鲁晓夫答波兰“人民论坛报”编辑部问  苏联愿意在任何地方举行高级会议  国际反动派休想让资本主义在社会主义国家里复辟

    赫鲁晓夫答波兰“人民论坛报”编辑部问
    苏联愿意在任何地方举行高级会议
    国际反动派休想让资本主义在社会主义国家里复辟
    新华社莫斯科12日电　“真理报”12日刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志对波兰“人民论坛报”编辑部提出的一些问题的答复。
    这些问题是“人民论坛报”编委布朗尼亚雷克和“人民论坛报”驻莫斯科记者卢茨基在3月10日向赫鲁晓夫提出的。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到高级会议时指出，苏联政府不久前提出的召开有政府首脑参加的高级会议的建议在世界各国获得了热烈的支持。可以有把握地说，如果高级会议能够举行并且能够取得相互谅解，那末这个会议就会大大有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势，有助于在社会制度不同的各国之间建立更大的信任。
    苏联同意举行外长会议是为了要加速高级会议的召开
    在答复苏联政府接受法国政府关于举行外长会议的建议后，事情进展如何的问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，关于这个问题，我们已经在苏联政府最近给美国总统艾森豪威尔先生的信中以及在备忘录中表明了态度。我们接受法国外交部长比诺提出的关于举行外长会议来筹备高级会议的建议，是由于我们是采取这样一种态度：凡是能够加速高级会议的召开而有益于和平事业的办法都是好的。因此我们主张利用一切途径，只要它们真正有助于这次会议的筹备工作。但是我们担心的是，怕外交途径会变成无休止的文件往来和无休止的谈判。
    对于那些反对安排会晤的政治家来说，通过外交途径的不公开会谈是很有利的，因为举行这种方式的会谈，人民就会一无所知，报纸也不会透露任何消息。
    我再说一遍，我们并不反对通过外交途径来谈判。我们主张的是有利于准备高级会议的谈判。但是一旦我们发现，外交途径和不公开会谈不能使会议早日召开，反而阻挠会议的召开，那么我们就要拒绝这种方式了。我们认为，这样就不如同意举行外交部长会议，因为外长会谈必定有一个肯定的日期，而且必须公开地举行。如果外长会谈破裂了，没有能就互相可以接受的议程和其他程序问题达成协议，那么大家都可以看到：这样一些外长开了会，这一个国家的态度是怎样的，那一个国家的态度又是怎样的。那时公众都有可能分辨和判断：谁真正拥护政府首脑高级会议，谁反对这个会议。如果外长们会谈后使高级会议流产了，那么大家都会确信：苏联政府的代表当初曾经对公众说外长会议很少有可能实现各国人民对会议的希望，这句预言是说对了。当然，应当注意到，现在的社会压力是极强大的。即使某些部长现在在骨子里反对停止“冷战”，但是在舆论的压力下，他们将不得不采取某些积极步骤。如果这种压力再进一步加强，他们就将不得不考虑社会舆论了。
    外长会议不应讨论实质问题，不能代替高级会议
    当然，在外长会议上也可能通过积极的决定。从我们这方面来说，我们将尽一切努力使外长会议获得成功。但是我们认为，外长不应当讨论实质问题，他们的工作是在组织方面准备和安排政府首脑会谈。如果全部实质问题都在外长会议上讨论，那么还举行高级会议做什么？
    “人民论坛报”代表问：我们认为，如果您和布尔加宁同志能到华盛顿去出席最高级会议，那将会给大家留下深刻的印象。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们考虑到美国总统由于一系列情况难于出国。我们也准备到美国去出席最高级会议。在我们看来，莫斯科和华盛顿之间的距离并不可怕：我们可以在家里吃早点，在飞机上用午餐，在美国吃晚饭。
    只要已经成熟的问题能够获得像世界人民所期望的那样的解决，为了和平事业和保证共处，我们同意到任何地方去出席高级会议。
    国际共产主义运动日益加强的团结是各国工人的兄弟联盟的最高表现
    赫鲁晓夫在回答关于最近两年来各国共产党和工人党之间相互关系的发展问题时说，各国共产党和工人党之间的关系，最近两年和过去一样，一直是在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上不断发展和不断加强。各国共产党号召各国人民团结起来为争取和平和社会主义而斗争。因此，各国共产党努力保持密切联系和行动一致。同时，每个党在政治上和组织上是完全独立的政党，代表着本国工人阶级和劳动人民的利益以及本国的民族利益。工人阶级以及全体劳动人民的国际主义利益和民族利益并不矛盾，相反地，是和谐地结合在一起的。各国共产党一向把加强无产阶级的国际团结看作是自己的神圣职责，并且坚决反对一切削弱国际工人运动团结的企图。
    现在可以满意地说，近年来特别加强了的国际共产主义运动不可动摇的团结一致是各国工人的兄弟联盟的最高表现。这种团结一致不是自发取得的。这是各国共产党和工人党在反对帝国主义反动势力和修正主义者企图在世界共产主义运动中制造分裂的斗争中锻炼出来的。
    工人阶级的敌人指望挑起兄弟党之间、特别是社会主义国家兄弟党之间的关系的“复杂化”。为了这些目的，他们企图夸大社会主义建设过程中的困难，利用社会主义国家相互关系中的一些局部的误会。自然，这种误会可能是有的，因为现在正在形成的是一种历史上前所未有的完全新型的关系。但是，经验表明，社会主义国家相互关系中的一切问题正在严格遵守无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上通过同志式的讨论获得解决，并且是可以获得解决的。
    自然，这种情况是不会令敌人感到满意的，他们希望社会主义国家的人民互相争吵。这就有利于他们实现在人民民主国家恢复资本主义制度的宿愿。譬如，大家知道，帝国主义反动派曾力求利用匈牙利事件以及波兰社会主义建设道路上的困难来达到自己的目的。如果说在从前曾有人怀疑匈牙利事件是否帝国主义势力制造的，那末现在大家都已很清楚，谁是匈牙利的法西斯匪徒的唆使者和怂恿者。
    社会主义的敌人大肆叫嚣，就是现在也还在继续叫嚣，说波兰发生了什么“特殊情况”啦，说波兰有什么离开社会主义道路的趋向啦。难道劳动人民能够甘心把自己的社会主义果实拱手交给敌人吗？能够甘心让资本主义秩序在社会主义国家里复辟吗？能够让工厂重新属于一小撮资本家所有、让土地重新回到地主和富农的手里吗？
    十分明显，国际反动派的代表人物想让资本主义在社会主义国家里复辟的梦想，是多么虚妄，多么荒唐！
    很清楚，波兰劳动人民绝对不能让资本家和地主的统治复辟。他们紧密地团结在波兰统一工人党的周围，克服着一切困难，他们今后仍将沿着社会主义建设的道路满怀信心地前进。不可能把这样的一个国家拉向后退，这个国家的人民已经走上社会主义的道路，为建设一个没有贫富、没有人剥削人、没有失业和贫困的新社会而劳动着。而在现在，当每一个社会主义国家都有整个强大的社会主义阵营的帮助和支持作为后盾的时候，这样做尤其是不可能的了。
    社会主义阵营在不断地壮大和巩固。不久以前，在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议就是这方面的明证。这次会议结果向全世界表明，帝国主义宣传家散布的“共产主义危机”之类的话是多么荒谬。这次会议意味着世界共产主义运动和工人运动在思想和政治上的巨大胜利。各兄弟党代表一致通过的两项宣言是具有巨大的动员力量的文件，它们证明了各共产党和工人党在争取社会主义和世界和平的斗争中的团结一致。
    敌人想破坏苏波两国人民友谊的企图注定失败
    在谈到苏波关系时，赫鲁晓夫说，人民波兰和苏联之间的友谊和合作过去和现在始终是在无产阶级国际主义和相互帮助的列宁主义原则的基础上、在完全平等和彼此尊重对方利益的基础上发展的。我们两国人民的友谊经受了多次严酷的考验。
    社会主义的敌人千方百计地抓住我们的旧嫌，找我们两国关系历史上的一些不利于我们两国人民友谊的阴暗面。他们利用民族主义情绪，企图挑起这种情绪。我们的敌人想破坏波兰和苏联两国人民友谊的一切企图注定是要失败的，因为我们两国人民清楚地知道，如果波兰和苏联之间的友谊不复存在，那只是对我们的敌人有利。
    苏联对待它同波兰的关系以及同其他一切社会主义国家的关系，过去和现在都始终遵循着经过考验的伟大的列宁主义原则。我们一贯主张，发展我们两国的兄弟关系，完全尊重我们两国人民的利益，发展波兰和苏联的互利的贸易，尽量扩大文化、体育和其他方面的联系，在为社会主义而共同奋斗当中互相帮助和互相支持，并且主张苏联共产党和波兰统一工人党最密切地合作。苏联人民和波兰人民都很明白，他们之间的友谊、社会主义阵营各国之间的友谊越紧密，我们各国也就越为巩固而使任何敌人无机可乘，新的社会主义世界的力量就越为强大，世界和平也就越为巩固。社会主义阵营国家的伟大力量，就在于它们的友好和团结。我们应该永远牢牢地记住这一点。
    我们两国在争取持久和平、反对新世界大战威胁的斗争中的合作关系正在卓著成效地发展。波兰政府对不久前苏联外交措施的支持，以及苏联政府对波兰政府提出在中欧建立无原子武器和氢武器地区这一宝贵倡议的支持，特别证明了这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我深信，波兰和苏联，以及一切社会主义国家之间的兄弟友谊、互相帮助和全面合作今后也一定会日益巩固和发展，以造福我们两国人民并有利于巩固世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中还谈到苏联最近两年来在发展国民经济方面的成就以及苏联科学和技术上的巨大成就和发展远景。同时，他还谈到了不同社会制度的国家和平共处的问题。
