    "Little Luo Cheng"
    In Wenxi there's a Wei Hanjiang,
    Though young in age, his skills are strong;
    An extermination hero, ridding us of pests,
    Surpassing even the Little Luo Cheng of old.
    Wei Hanjiang is from Dongganqing Village, Dongzhen Township, Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, and is fourteen years old this year. In addition to working one hundred and sixty workdays last year, he also created and utilized sixteen methods to kill six thousand eight hundred and eighty-five sparrows, catch one hundred and two rats, eliminate forty-three thousand six hundred flies, and ten taels of mosquitoes. Because he is particularly good at using slingshots to kill sparrows, the local people call him "Flying Insect (i.e., Sparrow) Harrier."

    “小罗成”
    闻喜有个魏汗江，
    年纪虽小本领强；
    消灭四害称英雄，
    赛过当年小罗成。
    魏汗江是山西闻喜县东镇乡东干庆村人，今年十四岁。他在去年除做了一百六十个劳动日外，还创造和利用了十六种办法，打麻雀六千八百八十五只，捕鼠一百零二只，消灭蝇子四万三千六百只，蚊子十两。由于他特别善于用弹弓打麻雀，所以当地群众称他为“飞虫（即麻雀）鹞子”。
