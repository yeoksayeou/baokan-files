Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 24th: Cadres and the masses in many counties and cities in Hubei Province are actively raising funds to support the local establishment of chemical fertilizer plants and other local industries.

The chemical fertilizer plants that Tianmen, Jingshan, Yicheng, Sui County and other counties have decided to build range in size from 10,000 tons to 40,000 tons annual output. Many cadres and agricultural cooperatives, upon hearing this news, invested to support them. They proposed that they have money and people. Sun Weimin, deputy director of the Sui County Grain Bureau, invested 500 yuan after learning that his county was going to build a chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons. Wang Dacheng, secretary of the Chenfan Township branch of the Communist Party of China and a demobilized soldier, took out all of his demobilization construction fee and usual savings, totaling 1,000 yuan, to support the construction of the chemical fertilizer plant. The Yangxin County Police Team, under the slogan of "Spend every penny," also raised 1,420 yuan to support local industries. The cadres and masses of Xinqiao Township in Tianmen County have developed a habit of diligence and frugality from top to bottom, with a total savings of 590,000 yuan among the 3,030 households in the township. This time, when they heard that their county was going to build a chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 21,000 tons, they immediately decided to invest 280,000 yuan.

More than 10,000 people in Xiangfan City held a conference on the 19th, expressing their determination to build a chemical fertilizer plant. At present, the declared investment from various units and individuals in the city has exceeded 2 million yuan. Lü Yongyou and Liu Ruisheng, members of the Communist Youth League in the Municipal People's Committee, and twelve others, proposed to cadres, workers, and teachers in the city to pool idle funds to run factories. This proposal was quickly met with a response.

    大伙出钱办工厂
    湖北干部群众踊跃集资
    新华社武汉24日电　湖北省许多县、市的干部和群众纷纷集资，支持当地兴办化肥厂等地方工业。
    天门、京山、宜城、随县等县决定兴办的化肥厂，小的年产一万吨，大的年产四万吨。许多干部和农业社听到这个消息后，纷纷投资支持。他们提出，要钱有钱，要人有人。随县粮食局副局长孙为民知道本县要兴办一座年产四万吨的化肥厂后，投资五百元；中共陈畈乡支部书记、转业军人王达成，把自己的转业建设费和平时积蓄共一千元全部拿出来，支持办化肥厂。阳新县的民警队在“有一分钱发一分光”的口号下，也集资一千四百二十元，支持办地方工业。天门新桥乡干部和群众从上到下勤俭成风，全乡三千零三十户共储蓄五十九万元；这次他们听说本县要办一座年产二万一千吨的化肥厂，当即决定投资二十八万元。
    襄樊市有一万多人，在19日举行大会，表示办化肥厂的决心。目前全市各单位和个人自报的投资已超过两百万元。市人民委员会共青团员吕永佑、刘瑞生等十二人，向本市干部、职工、教员倡议，把闲散的零星资金集中起来办工厂。这一倡议迅速得到了响应。
