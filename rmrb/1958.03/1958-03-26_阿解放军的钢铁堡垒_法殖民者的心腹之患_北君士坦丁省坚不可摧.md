The "Holy Warrior Newspaper" of the Algerian National Liberation Front recently published an article describing how the people of North Constantine Province in Algeria overcame the French colonial army's "scorched-earth tactics."

The article stated that the Algerian National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army established grassroots organizations in the mountains of North Constantine Province very early on. In this region, the National Liberation Army had the closest ties with the people, and they carried out effective political and ideological education work among them. The people also consciously strived to achieve the goals of the national revolution, organized themselves, and elected representatives to the People's Congress through free elections to replace the old officials of the colonial administration.

It was precisely for this reason that the French military headquarters considered this region to be a "mortal wound." Therefore, it concentrated its forces and took the following measures to deal with the national liberation movement: first, to surround the National Liberation Army troops with large-scale sweeps; second, to establish forbidden zones and move residents; third, to carry out scorched-earth tactics with artillery and aircraft.

Each French military sweep lasted an average of three to five days, and two divisions of troops were required to deal with seven or eight villages with five thousand to ten thousand residents. But this did not isolate and destroy the national liberation movement.

In this situation, the French army adopted the method of establishing "forbidden zones," concentrating the residents of this area near the French military strongholds, attempting to isolate the National Liberation Army in this way, and carrying out "pacification" and forcibly implementing the Algerian "Fundamental Law" on the residents. This was a new idea put forward by former French Prime Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury.

In order to surround the residents and force them to move to "regroupment camps," the French army dispatched 50,000 troops in June of last year to carry out two large-scale sweeps lasting seventeen days. But this also failed.

In the wake of the failure, the French military headquarters finally decided to wage "total war." It bombed each village three times a day, each time for one hour, dispatching an average of seventeen to thirty-five aircraft, sometimes even more than two hundred. It dropped not only a large number of bombs, but also napalm bombs and poison gas bombs. But the National Liberation Army organized air defense. Every household had a shelter. Residents quickly adapted to the environment, using the night to harvest crops, transport supplies, and conduct transactions.

The article emphasized that the French colonialists' establishment of "forbidden zones" and the implementation of a scorched-earth "total war" only resulted in the Algerian people being closely linked and inseparable from the National Liberation Army, thus making North Constantine Province an impregnable fortress and cradle of the national revolution since November 1954.

### 阿解放军的钢铁堡垒  法殖民者的心腹之患  北君士坦丁省坚不可摧

    阿解放军的钢铁堡垒
    法殖民者的心腹之患
    北君士坦丁省坚不可摧
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的“圣战者报”不久以前发表了一篇文章，叙述阿尔及利亚北君士坦丁省的人民如何战胜了法国殖民军的“焦土战”。
    这篇文章说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线和民族解放军在北君士坦丁省的山丛中，很早就建立了基层组织。在这个地区，民族解放军同人民的联系最密切，他们对人民进行了卓有成效的政治思想教育工作。而人民也自觉地争取实现民族革命的目的，组织起来，通过自由选举选出人民大会的代表，来代替殖民行政机构的旧官员。
    正是由于这个缘故，法军参谋部认为这个地区是“心腹之患”。于是，它集中力量，采取了下面的措施来对付民族解放运动：一、用大规模的扫荡来包围民族解放军部队；二、建立禁区并且迁走居民；三、用大炮和飞机进行焦土战。
    法军的扫荡战每次平均持续三五天，每对付有五千到一万个居民的七、八个村镇就得使用两个师的兵力。但是这样并不能孤立和摧毁民族解放运动。
    在这种情况下，法军就采取了建立“禁区”的办法，把这个地区的居民集中到法军据点附近，企图这样来孤立民族解放军，并且对居民进行“绥靖”和强制实施阿尔及利亚“根本法”。这是前法国总理布歇—莫努里出的新主意。
    为了包围居民和强制他们迁到“重新集结营”去，法军在去年6月间出动了五万人，进行了持续十七天的两次大扫荡。但是这也失败了。
    在失败之余，法军参谋部终于决定进行“总体战”。它每天对每个村镇空袭三次，每次一小时，出动飞机平均十七架到三十五架，有时甚至多至二百多架。投下的不仅有大量炸弹，还有凝固汽油弹和毒气弹。但是民族解放军组织了空防。每户人家都有掩蔽所。居民很快就适应了环境，利用夜间收获庄稼、运输给养和进行交易。
    文章着重指出，法国殖民者建立“禁区”和进行斩尽杀绝的“总体战”，其结果只有使阿尔及利亚人民同民族解放军休戚相关，血肉相连，从而使北君士坦丁省从1954年11月以来始终是民族革命不可攻克的堡垒和摇篮。　　　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
