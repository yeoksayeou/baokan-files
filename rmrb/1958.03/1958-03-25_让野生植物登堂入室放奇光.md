On March 22nd, Sichuan Daily published extensive news, communications, and articles about the discovery and utilization of wild plants on the front page headline and two full pages (pages two and three), and published an editorial entitled "Fully Utilize Wild Plants." The following is a summary of this editorial.

The issue of utilizing wild plants has been raised in the past, and some work has been done, but many people still do not pay enough attention to it. Because the benefits of a good thing are not immediately apparent in its nascent state; so, initially, only a few advanced elements agree, some people express doubts, and some even oppose it. It can be seen that the growth and expansion of new things always requires some discussion and will involve some twists and turns.

At present, the increase in cotton production in our country cannot fully meet the growing consumption needs of the people. Our country has always taken many active measures to solve this problem. This includes appropriately expanding cotton fields and increasing the yield per unit area of cotton fields, and preparing to actively develop the chemical fiber industry; at the same time, advocating thrift and economy in households, and saving on cotton use. These basic measures are correct and necessary. However, in addition to these basic measures, it has been proven through several years of experimentation that the use of wild fibers can not only replace cotton as wadding, but also some varieties, after technical processing, can be blended and woven to make various exquisite and high-quality cotton and woolen textiles. This provides us with a new way to solve the problem of cotton textile raw materials: it provides an indispensable auxiliary means to meet the growing cotton needs of the country and the people in the future. This advanced method of utilization has great prospects and can enable wild fibers to play their potential role in meeting people's needs for cotton clothing, which is the goal of utilizing wild fibers.

Of course, we should not underestimate the use of wild fibers by primary methods, because primary methods can utilize resources more widely. Some varieties cannot be utilized by advanced methods, or advanced methods do not use much raw material, so primary methods can be used extensively. Wild fibers can be spun into coarse yarn and woven into coarse cloth by hand, or wild fibers can be directly used to make ropes, weave sacks, make shoe soles, make paper, and so on. Those that cannot be used temporarily can be stored for future use. In carrying out these tasks, we should not be afraid of trouble, waste, backlog, or losing money. Because wild fibers are diverse, abundant, widely used, low in cost, and quick to yield results, and they do not occupy land, and the labor required for collection is also relatively small, as long as we can make every effort to open up avenues for utilizing these resources, so that various different varieties can be used appropriately, we can increase production, increase farmers' income, and prosper the mountain economy; there will be no waste, backlog, or loss of money.

According to a preliminary survey by relevant departments, 141 species of wild plants containing fiber have been discovered in the province, with an estimated annual output of about 6 million dan. This year, the province will use wild fiber to process 150,000 dan of rayon; by 1960, it will produce 2.5 million dan, which is equivalent to the cotton yield of 8 million mu of cotton fields, equal to 1.6 times the bumper cotton harvest in the province in 1957. This shows that in the case that cotton production cannot fully meet the needs of the people, the use of wild fiber as a substitute is promising. Only a small part is currently being used and researched for utilization. Therefore, even if cotton is not in short supply, we should not abandon the goods in the fields, but should actively and fully utilize them, and regard them as an important supplement to light industrial raw materials. This enables us to do more things in a short time with only a small amount of money, which not only promotes the development of local industries, but also increases social wealth.

The reason why the utilization of wild fibers has not been promoted in recent years is that, on the one hand, the publicity work has not been done enough; on the other hand, there is a lack of specific measures. Some people do not know much about wild fibers, some technical problems have not been solved in a timely manner, and some existing achievements have not been given due promotion; therefore, some people have doubts about the utilization and use of wild fibers, and they are not enthusiastic about doing this good thing.

Some people do not believe that wild fibers can be utilized in industry. In their view, it is impossible to extract fiber from the stems of wild grass and kudzu; even if fiber can be extracted, it cannot be used in the textile industry; as for applying it to machine spinning and weaving, it is even more unimaginable to them. Now, the results of the experiment have shown that not only can rayon be made from wild fibers, but also some varieties of fibers extracted can be blended with cotton or wool; the cotton stalk bark fiber, which has the largest output in the province and has always been considered unusable on machines, has recently been tested by Chongqing Daming Textile Factory and has also proven to be able to be blended with cotton to form 12-count yarn. These facts not only dispel some people's doubts, but also open up a broad road for the advanced utilization of wild fibers, and are also an important improvement in the technology of the textile industry. If we stick to conventions, rely only on outdated technical data to determine the use value of a certain raw material, and dare not boldly conduct experiments, and do not have the courage to carry out technical revolutions; that is to abandon the goods in the fields, and we cannot fully exert the potential power of this resource, which is detrimental to national construction. Of course, there are many technical problems in better utilizing wild fibers in industry, and we hope that relevant scientific and technical workers and economic workers can participate in this significant work with full enthusiasm. As long as we let go and mobilize the masses, everything can be solved through experimentation, and technical problems can also be solved.

There are also some people who are afraid that the masses will not trust and are unwilling to use products made from wild fibers. In fact, this concern is also unnecessary. The products made from wild fibers blended with cotton and wool are different from pure cotton and pure wool products in terms of quality, but after the mixed products have been appraised, as long as the mixing ratio is adjusted appropriately, the difference between the finished products is not significant. In the future, with the improvement of technology, the quality of products made from wild fibers will certainly be improved. Therefore, like other products, as long as it is suitable and the price is reasonable, it will definitely be welcomed by the masses. What's more, fully utilizing wild fibers as substitutes in the textile industry can also increase the output and enrich the variety of textiles, and can squeeze out some cotton for use in more needed areas. As long as we explain these principles to the masses, explain the political significance of this matter, and strive to improve product quality; then, some people's distrust of new products can be changed.

Our attitude should be that all that can be utilized should be collected and fully utilized in large quantities; those that cannot be utilized at present should also be actively researched and experimented to strive for early utilization. Our policy is: investigation and research, overall planning, full utilization, and active development. This applies to wild fibers, and also to other wild plants.

In order to fully utilize wild fibers and other wild plants, in addition to strengthening publicity and education work and further detailed investigation of the resources of wild plants throughout the province, plans should be made for future collection, purchase, and processing, and specific targets should be formulated on schedule to ensure their realization. The collection work is an arduous task. Based on the characteristics of the dispersion of wild plant resources and the large seasonality of growth, when arranging and organizing labor, we must firmly rely on the agricultural cooperatives in the production areas; in the collection process, we must also pay attention to not affecting the long-term utilization of resources, and we must educate and organize the masses in the production areas to pay attention to protecting resources during collection, so that they can continue to grow and reproduce, and prevent exhaustion of resources. Under possible conditions, artificial cultivation can also be promoted to ensure reproduction and adapt to needs. Because wild plants are of uneven quality, it is necessary to stipulate a simple and easy-to-implement standard and specification in the purchasing work; relevant departments should separately set reasonable purchasing prices for various different varieties and pay attention to balancing with the purchasing prices of other agricultural and sideline products. The processing of wild plants should be done locally as much as possible using indigenous methods; processing plants can be included in the local industrial development plan as a component of local industrial development; attention should be paid to the training of technical personnel, timely exchange and summarization of technical experience, and strengthening of technical guidance; the applicability of finished products also needs to be tested and studied in many aspects. In order to promote the utilization of wild resources and the development of production, and to reward and protect the use of wild fiber to develop the textile industry, consideration can also be given to reducing the burden of taxes levied by the state in the collection and processing of wild plants within a certain period of time. In short, this is a new work, a very important work, which not only requires strong support and cooperation from all aspects, but also requires unified management and strengthened leadership. The vast number of people in agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, industrial departments, scientific research departments, and other departments should be encouraged to work hard and make every effort to promote the development of this new undertaking. We believe that as long as we fully recognize the importance of this undertaking, as long as we have the determination and perseverance, and after painstaking research and hard work, we will surely be able to turn wild plants into social wealth, so that wild plants can "enter the hall" and shine with brilliance, becoming an indispensable companion in people's lives.

### 让野生植物登堂入室放奇光

    让野生植物登堂入室放奇光
    22日四川日报以一版头条地位和二、三两个整版发表了大量有关野生植物的发现和利用的消息、通讯和文章，并发表题为“充分利用野生植物”的社论。下面是这篇社论的摘要。
    关于利用野生植物的问题，过去曾经提过，而且也作了一些工作，但是，很多人还是重视不够。因为凡是一件好事，在萌芽状态时，它的好处并不是一下就显示出来；所以最初往往只是少数先进分子赞成，一部分人会表现怀疑，也还有人会反对。可见新生事物的成长壮大，总须要经过一番议论，也会出现一些曲折的过程。
    目前我国棉花的增长，还不能充分满足人民群众消费日益增长的需要。对于这个问题，我们国家历来是采取许多积极的措施来解决的。这就是适当的扩大棉田和提高棉田的单位面积产量，并且准备积极发展化学纤维工业；同时提倡勤俭持家，节约用棉。这些基本措施都是正确的。并且是必要的。但是，除了这些基本措施外，经过几年来的试验证明：利用野生纤维不仅可以代替棉花作絮棉使用，而且其中有些品种，经过技术加工，还可以混纺混织，制成各种精美优良的棉、毛纺织品。这样，就为我们提供了一个解决棉织原料问题的新途径：为满足国家和人民今后用棉日益增长的需要，找到了一个必不可少的辅助手段。这种高级的利用办法前途很大，可以使野生纤维在满足人们用棉穿衣的需要上发挥它的潜在作用，这是利用野生纤维的奋斗目标。
    当然，我们也不应该看轻用初级的办法对野生纤维加以利用，因为初级的办法可以比较广泛地利用资源。有些品种不能用高级办法利用，或是高级办法用不了多少原料，就可以大量采用初级办法利用，可以手工操作把野生纤维单纺粗纱、织粗布，也可以直接用野生纤维打绳子、织麻袋、作鞋底、造纸等等。暂时用不了的，还可以储备一些，以便不久的将来大量使用。在进行这些工作时，不应该怕麻烦、怕浪费积压、怕赔钱。因为野生纤维种类多、数量大、用途广、成本低、收效快，既不占用土地，采集所需的劳动力也较少，只要我们能够千方百计地开辟利用这些资源的门路，使各种不同的品种都能够恰如其分地被利用起来，就可以增加生产，增加农民收入，繁荣山区经济；不会有浪费积压和赔钱的问题。
    据有关部门的初步调查，本省已发现含有纤维的野生植物一百四十一种，估计年产约六百万担。今年全省将用野生纤维加工人造棉十五万担；到1960年将要生产二百五十万担，这个数字相当于八百万亩棉田的棉花产量，等于全省1957年棉花丰收的产量一点六倍。这说明，在棉花产量不能充分满足人民需要的情况下，利用野生纤维作为代用品，是大有可为的。现在被利用和正在研究利用的，也只是很少一部分。因此即使棉花不缺，也不应该让货弃于地，而应该积极充分地利用，并且把它当作轻工业原料的重要补充。使我们在短时间内只花少量的钱，就能够办更多的事，既促进地方工业的发展，也增加社会财富。
    几年来对野生纤维的利用之所以没有提倡起来，一方面是宣传工作做得不够；另方面也缺乏具体措施。有些人对野生纤维不大了解，一些技术问题没有得到及时的解决，已有的一些成就也没有得到应有的推广；因而有些人对野生纤维的利用和使用存在着疑虑，办这件好事的劲头不足。
    有些人对于野生纤维能够在工业上加以利用是不大相信的。在他们看来，从野草葛藤的茎秆中脱出纤维，这是不可能的事；即使能够脱出纤维，也不能运用在纺织工业上；至于运用于机纺、机织，则更是他们所不敢想像的事。现在，试验的结果已经表明，从野生纤维中不仅可以制成人造棉，而且有一些品种所脱出的纤维还可以和棉或毛混纺混织；全省产量最大而又一向被人认为不能上机器的棉秆皮纤维，最近经过重庆市大明纺织厂的试验，也证明能够和棉花混纺成十二支纱。这些事实，不仅解除了一些人的疑虑，而且开辟了用高级方法利用野生纤维的广阔道路，在纺织工业的技术上，也是一项重要的改进。如果墨守成规，只是依靠陈旧的技术资料去制定某一种原料的使用价值，不敢大胆地进行试验，没有勇气在技术上进行革命；那就是使货弃于地，就不能充分发挥这项资源的潜在力量，这对于国家建设是不利的。当然，在工业上更好地利用野生纤维，是存在着很多技术问题的，我们希望有关的科学技术工作者和经济工作者，能够满腔热情地来参加这件意义重大的工作。只要放手发动群众，一切经过试验，技术问题也是可以得到解决的。
    也还有些人怕群众对野生纤维所制成的产品不信任和不愿意使用。其实，这种顾虑也是不必要的。用野生纤维和棉、毛混纺混织的制成品，比之于纯棉、纯毛的制成品尽管在质量上存在着差别，但是混纺混织的产品，经过鉴定的结果，只要混合比例调剂得恰当，制成品的差别也是不大的。今后随着技术上的改进，用野生纤维制成的产品的质量，也一定能够提高。因此，这种产品也和其它产品一样，只要适用，价格合理，就一定能受到群众的欢迎。何况在纺织工业上充分利用野生纤维作代用品，还可以增加纺织品的产量和丰富品种，并且可以挤出些棉花来用到更需要的方面去。只要我们向群众说清楚这些道理，讲明这件事的政治意义，并且努力提高产品质量；那末，一些人对新产品的不信任的态度，是可以改变的。
    我们的态度应该是，凡是已经能够利用的，就应该大量收集，充分利用；目前还不能够利用的，也应该积极进行研究和试验，争取尽快地加以利用。我们的方针是：调查研究、全面规划、充分利用、积极发展。对野生纤维如此，对其它的野生植物也是如此。
    为了充分利用野生纤维和其它野生植物，除了加强宣传教育工作，对全省野生植物的资源进一步详细摸底外，对今后的采集、收购和加工，都应该作出规划，按期制定具体指标，保证实现。采集工作是一件繁重的任务，根据野生植物资源分散、生长的季节性较大等特点，在安排和组织劳动力时，要坚决依靠产地的农业社；采集中还要注意不要影响资源的长期利用，要教育和组织产地群众在采集时注意保护资源，使它能继续生长繁殖，防止枯本竭源。在可能的条件下，还可以提倡人工培育，以保证繁殖，适应需要。由于野生植物品种良莠不齐，在收购工作中，有必要规定一个简单易行的标准和规格；有关部门对各种不同的品种应该分别订出合理的收购价格并且注意和其它农副业产品的收购价格取得平衡。野生植物的加工，都应当尽可能地采用土办法就地加工；加工厂可以作为发展地方工业的一个组成部分，列入地方工业发展规划之内；要注意技术力量的培训，随时交流和总结技术经验，加强技术指导；对成品的适用问题，也还需要作多方面的试验和研究。为了促进野生资源的利用和生产的发展，奖励和保护利用野生纤维发展纺织事业，还可以考虑在一定时期内，在野生植物的采集、加工过程中，由国家减除税收的负担。总之，这是一件新的工作，是一件很重要的工作，不仅需要各方面的大力支援和共同协作，而且要统一归口、加强领导。农业社、供销合作部门、工业部门、科学研究等部门的广大人员，都应该鼓起干劲，尽一切努力促进这一新的事业的发展。我们相信，只要我们充分认识到这一事业的重要意义，只要我们有决心，有毅力，经过刻苦的钻研和辛勤的劳动，我们就一定能够把野生植物变成社会财富，使野生植物“登堂入室”放出奇光异彩，成为人们生活中的不可缺少的伴侣。（附图片）
