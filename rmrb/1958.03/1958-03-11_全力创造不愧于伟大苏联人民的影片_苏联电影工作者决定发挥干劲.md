    Exert Effort to Create Films Worthy of the Great Soviet People
    Soviet Film Workers Resolve to Exert Effort
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The All-Soviet Film Workers Conference was held in Moscow from February 28th to March 4th. More than 700 representatives from Soviet republics and various regions participated in the conference. The conference heard reports from Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov and others on the state and tasks of the Soviet film industry, on the skills of directors and actors, and on issues of creation and tradition, and passed corresponding resolutions.
    Mikhailov's report first discussed the current situation of Soviet film work, stating that in recent years, a huge turning point has occurred on the artistic front. Soviet film art has made great progress both in quantity and quality. In terms of feature films alone, 1957 increased fourteenfold compared to 1951. At the same time, Soviet films are increasingly actively participating on the international stage. Soviet films are now screened in seventy-two countries, and approximately one billion people in various countries watched Soviet films last year.
    In his report, Mikhailov particularly emphasized the current urgent task of film workers: to closely connect with reality and create rich and diverse works reflecting the great reality. In the great communist construction, people have made many extraordinary achievements. How can we not praise these great achievements!
    When talking about criticizing the backward aspects of society, Mikhailov said that some people, influenced by Western bourgeois ideology, doubt socialist realism and even attempt to distort the true situation of socialist society. However, peaceful coexistence does not mean the cancellation of ideological struggle. To eliminate the old remnants in people's consciousness and to educate the new generation with communist morality, criticism and self-criticism are necessary. Therefore, we need to use artistic means to criticize shortcomings. But do not forget that the decisive factor here is the artist's position.
    During the conference, Comrade Furtseva, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the CPSU to the conference. The Central Committee of the CPSU called on all Soviet film workers to use film art to portray the great changes and new things in socialist reality.
    After a heated discussion, the conference passed a resolution calling on film workers to strive for the high quality of every film and to concentrate all efforts on creating works with modern themes. The resolution also pointed out that it is necessary to greatly expand the training system for creative personnel, pay attention to improving the professional level of film workers, and expand the genre of film works.
    In a letter to the Central Committee of the CPSU, Soviet film workers stated that they would use all their energy to create works worthy of the great Soviet people.

    全力创造不愧于伟大苏联人民的影片
    苏联电影工作者决定发挥干劲
    本报讯　2月28日到3月4日在莫斯科举行了全苏电影工作者会议。苏联各加盟共和国和各地的七百多名代表参加了会议。大会听取了苏联文化部长米哈依洛夫等人关于苏联电影界的状况和任务，关于导演和演员的技巧，关于创作与传统等问题的报告，并通过了相应的决议。
    米哈依洛夫的报告首先谈到了苏联电影工作现状，他说，近年来在艺术战线上发生了巨大的转折。无论在数量上或质量上，苏联电影艺术都有了很大进步。仅在艺术片方面，1957年就比1951年增加了十四倍。同时，苏联影片日益积极地参加国际舞台。现在苏联影片在七十二个国家里放映，去年一年内，各国约有十亿人看到了苏联影片。
    米哈依洛夫在报告中特别强调了电影工作者当前的迫切任务：密切联系实际，创作丰富多采的反映伟大现实的作品。在伟大的共产主义建设中，人们作出了许许多多非凡的事迹，我们怎能不歌颂这些丰功伟绩呢！
    在谈到批评社会中落后面的时候，米哈依洛夫说，有的人受了西方资产阶级思想的影响，怀疑社会主义现实主义，竟企图歪曲社会主义社会的真实情况。但是，和平共处决不是说要取消思想斗争。要消除人们意识中的旧残余，要以共产主义道德教育新一代，必定需要批评和自我批评。所以，我们需要用艺术手段批评缺点。但是不要忘记，这里起决定性作用的是艺术家的立场。
    会议期间，苏共中央主席团委员福尔采娃同志向大会宣读了苏共中央的贺词。苏共中央号召全苏电影工作者通过电影艺术来刻划社会主义现实中伟大的变化和新事物。
    会议经过热烈讨论后通过决议，号召电影工作者为每部影片的高度质量而奋斗，号召集中全力创造现代主题的作品。决议并指出，须要大大扩大创作干部的培养系统，注意提高电影工作者的专业水平和扩大电影作品的体裁。
    苏联电影工作者在给苏共中央的信中表示，他们要用全部精力创造出不愧于伟大苏联人民的作品。
