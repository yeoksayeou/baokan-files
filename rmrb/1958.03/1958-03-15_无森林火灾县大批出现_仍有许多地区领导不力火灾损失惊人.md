(Our report) According to a recent report from the Ministry of Forestry, the nationwide "No Forest Fire" campaign has achieved significant success in recent years, with a marked reduction in forest fires across the country. Statistics from eleven provinces, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Guangdong, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, show that a total of 155 forest fire-free counties and 12,215 forest fire-free townships have emerged. The vast and historically fire-prone Greater Khingan Range forest area, for the first time in 1957, basically eliminated forest fires.

However, on the other hand, the forest fire prevention work in many provinces and counties is not well done and urgently needs to be strengthened. In some areas, forest fire prevention work remains at the level of general appeals, failing to truly mobilize the masses and take effective measures; still other areas, having made some initial achievements, have become complacent and self-satisfied, resulting in significant losses to the forests. In Yun County, Yicheng, Sui County, and other counties in Hubei Province, serious forest fires occurred in 1957 due to the failure of leading organs to focus on preventing mountain fires. In Yun County alone, more than 300 mountain fires occurred in the spring, burning 450,000 mu of mountain forests. In many areas of Fujian Province, the control of productive fire such as burning for land reclamation, burning wasteland, and burning ash for fertilizer in the autumn of 1957 was not strict, and mountain fires continued to occur. In September alone, 164 mountain fires occurred in 32 counties including Minhou, burning more than 1.2 million mu of mountain forests and more than 4.8 million large and small trees, an increase of two and a half times compared to the number of trees burned in the same period in 1956. In many places in Yunnan Province, one-sided emphasis was placed on burning ash for fertilizer last year, and control of fire sources was relaxed, resulting in as many as 3,800 fires throughout the year, burning 2.55 million mu of mountain forests and killing more than 30 people. In Luodian County, Guizhou Province, mountain fires occurred on 60% of the county's forest area last year. In Pingyan Township of this county, three farmers almost completely burned a mountain forest called "Youlipo." Afterwards, no one even cared. One county in Shaanxi Province won the honorary title of "Forest Fire-Free County" in 1956, but later developed complacency. In the first half of 1957, it failed to take effective fire prevention measures and became the county with the most serious fires in the special zone. The Ministry of Forestry requires all parts of the country to deeply carry out the forest fire-free competition this year, so that more forest fire-free counties will emerge this year.

### 无森林火灾县大批出现  仍有许多地区领导不力火灾损失惊人

    无森林火灾县大批出现
    仍有许多地区领导不力火灾损失惊人
    本报讯　据记者近日从林业部获悉：全国各地近年来开展的无森林火灾运动已获得显著成就，全国森林火灾显著减少。据黑龙江、吉林、广东、福建、陕西、四川等十一个省统计，共出现了一百五十五个无森林火灾县，一万二千二百十五个无森林火灾乡。面积辽阔、一向火灾严重的大兴安岭林区，1957年第一次基本上杜绝了森林火灾。
    但是，另一方面，也有许多省、县的护林防火工作做得不好，迫切需要加强。有些地区的护林防火工作尚停留在一般号召上，没有真正发动群众，并且采取有效的措施；还有些地区刚刚做出一点成绩，思想上就麻痹自满起来，结果使森林受到很大损失。湖北省郧县、宜城、随县等县，由于领导机关不抓紧防止山火，1957年都发生了严重的森林火灾，其中郧县仅在春季就发生三百多次山火，四十五万亩山林被烧毁。福建省的许多地区1957年秋季对于烧垦、烧荒、烧灰积肥等生产用火控制不严，山火不断发生。仅9月内闽侯等三十二个县就发生山火一百六十四次，烧毁山林一百二十多万亩，烧毁大小树木四百八十多万株，比1956年同期烧毁树木数字增加了两倍半。云南省许多地方去年片面强调烧灰积肥，放松了对火源的控制，以致全年火灾次数多达三千八百多次，烧毁山林面积二百五十五万亩，烧死了三十多人。贵州省罗甸县60％的山林面积上去年都发生了山火。这个县的平岩乡有三个农民几乎把一片叫做“油里坡”的山林全部烧光。事后竟无人过问。陕西省有一个县1956年获得了“无森林火灾县”的光荣称号，可是后来滋长了自满情绪，1957年上半年没有切实采取防火措施，竟变成了所在专区火灾最严重的一个县。林业部要求全国各地今年深入开展森林无火灾竞赛，在今年出现更多的无森林火灾县。
