New Steps in the Soviet Union's Development of Agricultural Productive Forces
Li He

A few days ago, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session adopted the decision on "Further Developing the Collective Farm System and Reorganizing Machine Tractor Stations" based on Comrade Khrushchev's report, and submitted the outline of Comrade Khrushchev's report on this issue, which he is preparing to deliver at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting, to nationwide discussion. This is the third nationwide discussion in the Soviet Union in recent years, following the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy and the reorganization of the industrial management system. This shows the importance of this matter. Undoubtedly, in this nationwide discussion, the Soviet people will put forward many creative suggestions and specific supplements, and will fully support this wise decision of the CPSU Central Committee, because this decision is a necessary step in the great leap forward of Soviet agriculture.

The restoration and development of the Soviet national economy after the war, especially the rapid advancement of industry, required agriculture to keep pace. Therefore, the CPSU Central Committee made a decision in the September 1953 plenary session on further developing agriculture. This was a new turning point in the development of agricultural production after the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union. Since then, a new stage of great leap forward in Soviet agriculture has begun. Over the past four years, the Soviet Party, government, and people have spent infinite thought and effort in developing agriculture, making the countryside surge with a high tide of production and full of vigorous atmosphere. However, because Soviet agriculture has been taking the road of great leap forward in recent years, and the measures taken are innovative, it cannot be measured by a conservative perspective. For example, the move to reclaim large areas of wasteland in the east, and the call to surpass the United States in per capita production of meat, milk, and fats are all leaps forward, so they have been met with suspicion by conservatives both at home and abroad. However, before long, these measures have achieved great success. In a country like the Soviet Union, with vast rural areas, sparse population, strong mechanization forces, and abundant funds, land reclamation has increased the total grain harvest by 27% in four years. The long-standing backwardness of animal husbandry has also been rapidly changed. Over the past four years, cattle have increased by 10.9 million head, pigs by 11 million head, and sheep by more than 20 million head, with meat production increasing by 38% and milk by 50%. These facts show that if we do everything possible to tap potential, there is no limit to the development of socialist agricultural productive forces!

In recent years, the Soviet Union has been developing agricultural production from many aspects: paying attention to both grain and cotton, livestock products, paying attention to both wasteland reclamation and increasing yield per unit area, and paying attention to both leadership and technology; it is not difficult to see that there is a central idea, like a red thread running through all of this, which is to oppose conservatism. Tens of thousands of party members and agricultural technicians went to the countryside to support collective farms; many important agricultural meetings were held not in the central government but on-site in local areas; raising the prices of agricultural products to stimulate the production enthusiasm of collective farmers; formulating agricultural production plans from the bottom up to give play to the production initiative of collective farms; and even popularizing the unconventional cultivation methods of Maltsev. Aren't all these manifestations of the spirit of anti-conservatism and innovation? Opposing conservatism is precisely the basic reason why Soviet agriculture has dared to leap forward and has been able to leap forward in recent years. The decision to "Further Develop the Collective Farm System and Reorganize Machine Tractor Stations" is a continuation of this spirit of opposing conservatism and striving for a leap forward. We know that the Soviet countryside is composed of three elements: collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms; state farms have their own means of production, while the main means of production of collective farms – tractors and other agricultural machinery – are supplied by machine tractor stations. The implementation of the new measures will transform 8,000 machine tractor stations into technical repair stations, and allow approximately 78,000 collective farms to purchase and use agricultural machinery themselves. This means a change in the composition of the socialist countryside, the form of agricultural production technology, and the way the state leads collective farms. This is a major reform. It is proposed at such a high level of development of the collective farm system in the Soviet Union today, and it is a product of the new situation of the agricultural leap forward in the Soviet Union. In turn, it will inevitably promote a greater leap forward in agricultural productive forces.

For nearly thirty years, with the exception of the land operated by state farms, the vast land in the Soviet countryside has been cultivated by collective farms and machine tractor stations in cooperation. This has created a situation in which there are two masters on one piece of land, one master controlling labor and the other master controlling the main means of production. When the scale of collective farms was still small, and their organizational, economic, and technical strength was still weak, and they had to rely on the guidance and support of machine tractor stations, this situation was once conducive to the development of agricultural productive forces. The history of the emergence and development of machine tractor stations proves this point. Thirty years ago, the Shevchenko State Farm in Odessa Oblast, Ukraine, established a working team with ten tractors to help the surrounding poor and middle peasants. Later, at the request of the peasants, machine tractor stations were established throughout the Soviet Union. In early 1930, the CPSU Central Committee decided to sell machine tractor stations to collective farms based on the suggestions of collective farm shock workers. The pilot project was unsuccessful. This decision was cancelled at the end of 1930. Because at that time, collective farms did not have the financial resources to purchase complex machinery, did not have the technical personnel to use these machines, and did not have the strength to guarantee the renewal of the machines every six, seven, or eight years. Even a few years ago, when collective farms had not yet been merged, when agricultural production had not yet been improved, and when most collective farms were still small and weak, it was impossible to sell the machines of tractor stations to collective farms. Therefore, machine tractor stations have played a decisive role in the establishment and consolidation of the collective farm system in its thirty years of existence. The state, through machine tractor stations, has provided long-term support to farmers who do not have the strength to self-equip technical equipment, which is inconceivable under the capitalist system.

However, after all, it is inconvenient and uneconomical to have two masters on one piece of land, and to separate labor and the main means of production. Because complex technical equipment is concentrated in the hands of machine tractor stations, collective farms cannot directly control and use this equipment to fully unleash the full potential of collective farm production. Collective farms and machine tractor stations have to maintain two management institutions to complete one task, which greatly increases the cost of agricultural products. In the Soviet countryside, we have seen the close cooperation between machine tractor stations and collective farms, and we have also seen the contradictions between the two, for example: collective farms feel that the land cultivated by tractor stations is not qualified, and tractor stations believe that the manpower sent by collective farms is not timely. Therefore, advanced agricultural laborers have long been looking for new forms to improve the relationship between the two. In 1952, when the Chinese Farmers Delegation visited Kuban, the famous tractor team leader Shatsky told us his novel views: to unify the leadership of the tractor work team and the field production team of the collective farm. Last year, in many rural areas, we have seen the trial implementation of this opinion. Some machine tractor stations only serve one large collective farm, and the chairman of the collective farm is responsible for leading the two units. Some collective farms are only served by one tractor work team, where a mixed team of tractor and field production headed by the field production captain of the collective farm has emerged. Obviously, the infinitely active socialist agricultural productive forces are pursuing a broader new world. Therefore, now that most collective farms are economically strong and have sufficient technical personnel, the new form of technical service for collective farm production has "matured." The reorganization of machine tractor stations, the state selling tractors, combine harvesters, and other machinery directly to collective farms, so that one collective farm unit is fully responsible for the land it operates, and the more harmonious combination of labor and means of production will inevitably greatly increase the production enthusiasm of collective farmers and unleash the infinite potential of collective farm production, thereby further developing the collective farm system.

Reorganizing machine tractor stations and selling machines to collective farms involves the theoretical issues of collective farm ownership and ownership by the whole people in the Soviet Union. From a metaphysical point of view, the machines – means of production – now controlled by tractor stations will be controlled by collective farms in the future, so it seems that the strengthening of the collective farm system is due to weakening ownership by the whole people. From a dialectical point of view, this is not the case. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union is moving towards a communist society, and in order to transition to a communist society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," there must be very rich products and very developed productive forces. Therefore, what can raise the level of collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people are those factors that can promote rather than hinder the development of agricultural productive forces. This is one. Second, cooperative-collective farm ownership and ownership by the whole people are two forms of socialist ownership, and the two are not mutually opposed and exclusive. The strengthening of the collective farm system is a sign of the strengthening of the socialist economic system. Because ownership by the whole people will still dominate throughout the Soviet Union in the future, because collective farms will rely on the state to directly supply machinery, and because the agricultural products obtained by the state under the circumstances of the development of collective farm production will increase rather than decrease, the strengthening of the collective farm system will only be conducive to the strengthening of the worker-peasant alliance, and will only be conducive to ownership by the whole people. Third, raising the level of collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people cannot be achieved by weakening this ownership, but on the contrary, it can only be achieved by strengthening this ownership. In recent years, most of the state farms established by the Soviet Union in the newly reclaimed areas in the east are state farms, and hundreds of poorly managed collective farms throughout the Soviet Union have voluntarily changed to state farms. However, the CPSU Central Committee is still sparing no effort to consolidate and develop tens of thousands of collective farms across the country. In his report outline, Comrade Khrushchev summarized the experience of Soviet collective farms and said: "Under the current conditions, the public accumulation funds of collective farms are in essence close to ownership by the whole people,... The more public accumulation funds, the more machines the collective farms will have, the more mechanized labor will be, the easier the work of the collective farm members will be, the higher labor productivity will be, and the faster the public economy will develop. The labor of collective farm members based on the widespread adoption of modern technical equipment will be close in nature to the labor of industrial workers."

    苏联发展农业生产力的新步骤
    李何
    前几天，苏共中央全会就赫鲁晓夫同志的报告通过了“进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的决定，并且把赫鲁晓夫同志准备在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作的这个问题的报告提纲交给全民讨论。这是苏联最近几年来继第六个发展国民经济五年计划和工业管理制度改组之后而举行的第三次全民讨论。可见这件事情的重大。无疑的，在这次全民讨论中，苏联人民将会提出许多创造性的建议和具体的补充，将会全力支持苏共中央这个英明的决定，因为这个决定是苏联农业大跃进的一个必然的步骤。
    战后苏联国民经济的恢复和发展，特别是工业的飞跃前进，要求农业的脚步跟上去。因此苏共中央在1953年九月全会作了关于进一步发展农业的决定。这是苏联农业集体化以后农业生产发展的一个新的转折点。从此开始了苏联农业大跃进的新阶段。四年来，苏联党、政府和人民在发展农业方面花费了无限的心思和力量，使农村中涌现出生产的高潮，充满朝气蓬勃的气象。然而，由于苏联农业这几年来所走的是跃进的道路，所采取的是革新的措施，它不是用守旧的眼光所能衡量的。如像在东部开垦大块荒地的举动，肉类、牛奶和油脂产量按人口计算赶过美国的号召，都是跃进，所以在苏联国内外都遭到保守分子的怀疑。但是，曾几何时，这些措施已经取得巨大的成就。在苏联这样农村地大、人少、机械化力量强大和资金雄厚的国家里，开荒使谷物的总收成在四年中增加了27％。畜牧业长期落后的现象也迅速地改观了。四年来牛增加了一千零九十万头、猪——一千一百万头、羊——两千多万只，肉类增产38％，牛奶——50％。这些事实说明，如果千方百计发掘潜力，社会主义农业生产力的发展那有止境！
    苏联最近几年是从多方面发展农业生产的：既注意粮食又注意棉花、畜产品，既注意开荒又注意提高单位面积产量，既注意领导又注意技术；不难看出，有一个中心思想，像一根红线贯穿这一切，这就是反对保守。成千成万党员和农业技术人员下乡增援集体农庄；许多重要的农业会议不在中央而在地方现场举行；提高农产品价格以刺激集体农民的生产积极性；从下而上编制农业生产计划以发挥集体农庄的生产能动性；以至于推广打破常规的马尔采夫耕作方法。这一切难道不是反保守的革新的精神的表现么？反对保守，正是苏联农业这几年来敢于跃进、能够跃进的基本原因。“进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的决定，正是这种反对保守、争取跃进的精神的继续。我们知道，苏联的农村是由集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场三者构成的；国营农场自备生产工具，而集体农庄的主要生产工具——拖拉机和其他农机是靠机器拖拉机站供应的。新措施的实行，将使八千个机器拖拉机站改组为技术修理站，将使约七万八千个集体农庄自己购进和使用农业机器。这意味着社会主义农村的构成、农业生产技术形式和国家领导集体农庄的方式的改变。这是重大的改革。它是在苏联集体农庄发展到今天这样高度水平上提出来的，它是苏联农业跃进的新形势下的产物，它反过来必然将促使农业生产力更大地跃进。
    将近三十年来，除了由国营农场经营的土地以外，苏联农村的广大土地是由集体农庄和机器拖拉机站合作耕种的。这样形成了一块土地上有两个主人，一个主人支配劳动力，一个主人掌握主要的生产工具的局面。当集体农庄的规模还小，它们的组织、经济和技术的力量还薄弱，必须依靠机器拖拉机站的指导和支持的时候，这种局面曾经是有利于农业生产力的发展的。机器拖拉机站产生和发展的历史证明了这点。三十年前，乌克兰敖德萨州谢夫钦科国营农场建立了一支拥有十台拖拉机的工作队，帮助周围的贫农和中农，后来根据农民的要求，在苏联全国建立了机器拖拉机站。1930年初，苏共中央曾经按照集体农庄突击队员的建议，决定把机器拖拉机站卖给集体农庄。试行的结果不成功。在1930年底取消了这个决定。因为当时集体农庄没有资力购置复杂的机器，没有技术干部使用这些机器，也没有力量保证机器每六、七、八年一次的更新。甚至在几年以前，当集体农庄还没有合并，当农业生产还没有改进，当大多数集体农庄还小还弱的时候，也不可能把拖拉机站的机器卖给集体农庄。因此，机器拖拉机站在它存在的三十年中，一直对集体农庄制度的建立和巩固起了决定性的作用，国家经过机器拖拉机站，给没有力量自置技术设备的农民以长期的支援，这在资本主义制度下是不可设想的。
    然而，一块土地上有两个主人，劳动力和主要的生产工具分成两节，毕竟是不方便、不经济的。由于复杂的技术设备集中在机器拖拉机站手里，集体农庄无法直接支配和使用这些设备来最充分地发挥集体农庄生产的全部潜力。集体农庄和机器拖拉机站不得不维持两个管理机构来完成一个任务，这就大大提高了农产品的成本。在苏联农村，我们看到了机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的紧密合作，也看到了两者的矛盾，例如：农庄觉得拖拉机站所耕的土地不合格，拖拉机站认为农庄派出的人力不及时。因此，先进的农业劳动者早在寻找改进两者关系的新形式。1952年当中国农民代表团访问库班的时候，著名的拖拉机队队长沙茨基就向我们谈了他的新颖的见解：把拖拉机工作队和农庄田间生产队的领导统一起来。去年，在许多农村，已经见到这种意见的试行。有的机器拖拉机站只为一个大集体农庄服务，由集体农庄主席负责领导两个单位。有的集体农庄只由一个拖拉机工作队服务，那里出现了以集体农庄田间生产队长为首的拖拉机兼田间生产混合队。显然，无限活跃的社会主义农业生产力在追求更加广阔的新天地。所以，现在当大部分集体农庄经济雄厚并且拥有充足的技术干部的时候，为集体农庄生产技术服务的新形式就“瓜熟蒂落”了。机器拖拉机站的改组，国家把拖拉机、收割联合机及其他机器直接卖给集体农庄，由集体农庄一个单位对它所经营的土地负全部责任，把劳动力和生产工具更加合拍地结合起来，这必然将大大提高集体农民的生产积极性，发挥集体农庄生产的无穷潜力，从而进一步发展集体农庄制度。
    改组机器拖拉机站，把机器卖给集体农庄，牵涉到苏联集体农庄所有制和全民所有制的理论问题。用形而上学的眼光来看，现在由拖拉机站掌握的机器——生产工具，将来归集体农庄掌握，这样集体农庄制度的加强似乎是由于削弱全民所有制。用辩证的眼光看来，事情却不是这样的。大家知道，苏联正向共产主义社会迈进，而要过渡到“各尽所能、各取所需”的共产主义社会，必须有非常丰富的产品，必须有非常发达的生产力，因此，能够把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平的，是那些能够促进而不是妨碍农业生产力发展的因素。这是一。第二，合作社—集体农庄所有制和全民所有制是社会主义所有制的两种形式，两者不是互相对立和排斥的。集体农庄制度的加强，正是社会主义经济制度的加强的一个标志。由于全民所有制在苏联全国范围内将来仍然占居优势，由于集体农庄将靠国家直接供应机器，由于国家在集体农庄生产发展的情形下所获得的农产品将有增无减，集体农庄制度的加强只会有利于工农联盟的加强，只会有利于全民所有制。第三，把集体农庄所有制提高到全民所有制的水平，这不能通过削弱这个所有制的途径，恰恰相反，只能通过加强这个所有制的途径。最近几年苏联在东部新垦区建立的绝大部分是国营农场，全苏各地也有几百个经营不善的集体农庄自愿改变为国营农场。但是苏共中央对于巩固和发展全国数以万计的集体农庄，仍然是不遗余力的。赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告提纲中概括苏联集体农庄的经验时说：“在当前的条件下，集体农庄的公积金实质上已近乎全民所有，……公积金越多，集体农庄的机器也就越多，劳动将更加机械化，集体农庄庄员的工作将更轻便，劳动生产率将越高，公有经济将发展得更快。以广泛采用现代化技术设备为基础的集体农庄庄员的劳动在性质上将接近产业工人的劳动。”
