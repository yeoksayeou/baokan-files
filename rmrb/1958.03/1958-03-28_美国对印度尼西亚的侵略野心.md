U.S. Aggressive Ambitions Towards Indonesia
	Wan Feng

    Today, as the Indonesian government's campaign to suppress the rebellion has achieved initial victories, U.S. imperialism is in a state of anxiety. It is intensifying its conspiracy to interfere in Indonesia. Following the Manila meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the United States is using the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan as its tool for intervention, transporting weapons to the rebels in Central Sumatra through Taiwan. The United States is also preparing to use the pretext of "evacuating nationals" to send warships to the areas where the rebels are entrenched, in order to intimidate the Indonesian people. These activities of the United States are a continuation and development of the aggressive policy that the United States has consistently adopted towards Indonesia since the end of World War II.
    Although Indonesia has declared independence for more than a decade, in the eyes of the U.S. imperialists, Indonesia has never been regarded as a sovereign state, but as a "power vacuum" to be filled by the United States, and as an indispensable "strategic stronghold" for the United States in the Pacific. General Willoughby, a special agent who once served as the head of intelligence under MacArthur, said not long ago that a "power vacuum" has emerged in Indonesia today. He even more blatantly provoked, saying: "If Sukarno wins control of Dutch New Guinea, it will break the West's defense line in the Pacific." Today, "we may have to fight again to seize this gap." Ryan, a news analyst for the Associated Press, while advocating that the United States openly support the rebels in Indonesia, unreservedly stated that Indonesia is "an important strategic area at the junction of the Indian and Pacific Oceans" for the United States. "Business Week," the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, had stated as early as 1954 that if Indonesia insists on maintaining its policy of national independence and not joining military blocs, "then the West will suffer a blow even more serious than the failure in Indochina."
    These blatant remarks disregarding Indonesia's independent sovereignty show that the basic policy of the United States towards Indonesia is to replace the position of the Dutch colonialists and turn Indonesia into a sphere of influence and colony of the United States. Although the United States has continuously changed its methods and tactics with the changing situation, it can be said that it has never abandoned its ambition to invade Indonesia for more than a decade.
    After the Indonesian people declared independence on August 17, 1945, the United States attempted to take advantage of the opportunity of the Dutch resurgence to intervene in Indonesia. In July 1947, the United States supported the Netherlands in tearing up the "Linggadjati Agreement," igniting the flames of the first colonial war of aggression. When the Dutch colonialists were unable to continue fighting, the United States came out again to play a double-dealing trick. It roped in Australia and Belgium to form a "Three-Nation Mediation Committee" just one month after the war began, and intervened under the pretext of "mediation." In January 1948, the United States forced Indonesia to sign the so-called "Renville Truce Agreement," causing great damage to the Indonesian people.
    The United States supported the Netherlands in conducting a colonial war in Indonesia in order to "borrow a knife to kill," letting the Dutch colonialists serve it. In order to achieve this goal, the United States used the "Marshall Plan" to aid the Netherlands with 1.5 billion US dollars, helping the Netherlands launch its second offensive against Indonesia at the end of 1948.
    In addition, the United States also used "aid" as a pretext to force the then Indonesian government to sign the so-called "Fox Agreement," seizing the privilege of monopolizing Indonesia's foreign trade for fifteen years at the cost of only 530,000 US dollars. When the Netherlands' second colonial war could not continue, the United States in the autumn of 1949 again used "mediation" as a pretext to force Indonesia to accept the "Round Table Conference Agreement" with many enslaving clauses. At the same time, it used the divisive means of forming the "United States of Indonesia" to prevent Indonesia from embarking on the road of true independence.
    From the signing of the "Round Table Conference Agreement" to August 1954, when the Netherlands was forced to agree to abolish part of the "Round Table Conference" agreement, the situation in the Far East underwent earth-shaking changes. With the liberation of the Chinese people, the anti-colonial struggle throughout Asia rose even higher. The Indonesian people also abolished the divisive situation imposed on them on August 15, 1950, restored the unified Republic of Indonesia, and strongly demanded the abolition of the "Round Table Conference Agreement" and the recovery of West Irian. Under such circumstances, the main means used by the United States was to put up the banner of "neutrality," manipulate the United Nations, and secretly support the Netherlands in continuing to illegally occupy West Irian. At the same time, it forced the Indonesian government to assume the obligations of the "Marshall Plan," sign the "Mutual Security Agreement," step up economic infiltration, and gradually squeeze out the remaining colonial forces of the Netherlands and Britain.
    However, the overall situation in Asia became increasingly unfavorable to imperialist colonial forces. Not to mention that U.S. imperialism had been battered and bloodied on the Korean battlefield and was forced to accept a truce; the Indochina war that it supported France with large amounts of dollars and weapons also suffered a disastrous defeat. On the other hand, especially after the Asian-African Bandung Conference in April 1955 and the Indonesian general election in September of the same year, the forces of national independence in Indonesia gained significant development, and in April 1956, all the "Round Table Conference Agreements" were abolished. The eighty-four million Indonesian people raised the banner of opposing colonialism and defending national independence even higher. At this time, the U.S. imperialist aggression against Indonesia began to become more and more concealed, and also more and more insidious. It attempted to change Indonesia's peaceful and independent policy through subversion and sabotage activities, thereby pulling it into the military bloc controlled by the United States. From the conspiracy to sabotage the general election behind the scenes in 1955, to the creation of the Lubis coup in 1956, and the support of Hussein and Simbolon's separatist activities, etc., were all manifestations of this subversion and sabotage conspiracy. By the time Sukarno announced the national salvation plan in February 1957, especially around December of the same year when Indonesia resolutely launched an anti-Dutch struggle, the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian people became unprecedentedly acute. The subversion and sabotage of the United States became even more vicious and unscrupulous. On the one hand, it continued to feign "neutrality," obstructing Indonesia from realizing its demand to recover West Irian, and stepped up the establishment of military bases in West Irian; on the other hand, it did not hesitate to adopt various despicable means to support the Hussein and other rebel groups, attempting to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia and force the Indonesian people to abandon the independence they had won through long and arduous struggle.
    This series of U.S. aggressive activities, whether it was "borrowing a knife to kill" or subversion and sabotage, its basic purpose was to place Indonesia, this rich country, under its control, so as to arbitrarily exploit and enslave the Indonesian people. Now, although the United States has not yet completely replaced the remaining Dutch colonial forces in Indonesia, U.S. monopoly capital has indeed gradually infiltrated Indonesia's important economic sectors in recent years. In 1957, U.S. direct investment in Indonesia had increased to 350 million U.S. dollars, accounting for 15% of all foreign direct investment in Indonesia, surpassing Britain and ranking second only to the Netherlands. At the same time, in the activities of squeezing out the old colonialists, it has controlled a considerable part of the British and Dutch investment in Indonesia. In Indonesia's import and export trade, the United States has surpassed the Netherlands and Britain and ranks first. Major monopoly enterprises such as Mobil Oil, Texaco, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber have controlled a large part of the positions in Indonesia's oil, rubber, steel, and non-ferrous metal industries. U.S. monopoly capital also uses the means of "making profits as capital," extracting 25% of profits every year as new investments, and gradually extending its tentacles in Indonesia's economy. It is obvious that U.S. monopoly capital groups are unwilling to see Indonesia embark on the road of independent development. Therefore, it is not difficult for people to understand why U.S. monopoly enterprises in Indonesia actually disregarded the most basic principles of international law and illegally colluded with and supported Indonesian rebel groups.
    Facts have proved that the Indonesian people's anti-colonial struggle is inseparable from opposing the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of aggression. Compared with the old colonialists such as the Netherlands, the enemy that the Indonesian people face is more insidious and vicious. However, no matter how concealed or disguised it is, the Indonesian people can still see through the true face of this new type of colonialist, the United States. Today, opposing U.S. imperialist intervention has become an important link in the Indonesian people's opposition to rebel activities and the entire anti-colonial struggle. The Indonesian people have a heroic saying: Once free, forever free! The Indonesian people who have stood up demand to resolutely defend their independence and continue to move forward along the road of independent development. This is something that no means of any imperialism can stop.

    美国对印度尼西亚的侵略野心
    万峰
    在印度尼西亚政府讨伐叛乱的进军已经旗开得胜的今天，美帝国主义焦灼万状。它正在加紧进行干涉印度尼西亚的阴谋活动。在东南亚集团马尼拉会议之后，美国又把台湾蒋介石集团作为它的干涉工具，通过台湾运送武器给中苏门答腊的叛乱分子。美国还准备借口“撤退侨民”，派军舰到叛乱分子盘踞的地区，对印度尼西亚人民进行恐吓。美国这些活动，是第二次世界大战结束以来，美国一贯对印度尼西亚采取的侵略政策的继续发展。
    虽然印度尼西亚已经宣布独立十几年了，但是在美帝国主义者的眼里，从来不把印度尼西亚看作是一个主权国家，而是把它看作一个要由美国去填补的“实力真空”，是美国在太平洋上一块不可少的“战略重地”。曾经在麦克阿瑟手下当过情报处长的特务将军威洛贝不久以前就说过，今天印度尼西亚已出现了“实力的真空”。他更加露骨地挑衅说：“如果苏加诺赢得对荷属新畿内亚的控制权，那就要打破西方在太平洋的防卫线”，今天“我们可能不得不再为争夺这个缺口而战了”。美联社新闻分析员瑞安，在鼓吹美国公开支持印度尼西亚的叛乱分子时，毫不掩饰地说：印度尼西亚对于美国说来，是“印度洋和太平洋交界处的一个重要的战略地区”。美国垄断资本的喉舌“商业周刊”，更早在1954年就说过，要是印度尼西亚坚持维护民族独立和不参加军事集团的政策，“那末，西方将受到一个比印度支那失败还要严重的打击”。
    这些露骨的漠视印度尼西亚独立主权的言论表明，美国对印度尼西亚的基本政策就是要代替荷兰殖民者的地位，把印度尼西亚变成美国的势力范围和殖民地。尽管随着形势的变化，美国在作法和手段上不断有所改变，但是可以说，十几年来它始终没有放弃侵略印度尼西亚的野心。
    1945年8月17日印度尼西亚人民宣布独立后，美国就企图乘荷兰卷土重来的机会，插足印度尼西亚。1947年7月，美国支持荷兰撕毁“林牙椰蒂协定”，点起了第一次殖民侵略的战火。当荷兰殖民者打不下去的时候，美国就又出来耍两面派的手段。它在战争刚打了一个月以后拉拢澳大利亚和比利时组成一个“三国调停委员会”，以“调处”为名进行干涉。1948年1月，美国压迫印度尼西亚签订了所谓“伦维尔休战协定”，使印度尼西亚人民蒙受了极大的损害。
    美国支持荷兰在印度尼西亚进行殖民战争，是为了“借刀杀人”，让荷兰殖民者替它服务。为了达到这个目的，美国用“马歇尔计划”曾经援助荷兰十五亿美元，帮助荷兰在1948年底发动对印度尼西亚的第二次进攻。
    此外，美国还以“援助”为名，迫使当时的印度尼西亚政府签订所谓“福克斯协定”，仅以五十三万美元的代价就攫取了在十五年内垄断印度尼西亚对外贸易的特权。在荷兰的第二次殖民战争打不下去的时候，美国于1949年秋天又以“斡旋”为名，迫使印度尼西亚接受了附有许多奴役性条款的“圆桌会议协定”。同时以组成“印度尼西亚合众国”的分裂手段，阻挡印度尼西亚走上真正独立的道路。
    从签订“圆桌会议协定”到1954年8月荷兰被迫同意废除一部分“圆桌会议”协定的一段时期里，远东形势起了翻天复地的变化。随着中国人民的解放，整个亚洲的反殖民主义斗争更加高涨起来。印度尼西亚人民也于1950年8月15日取消了强加给他们的分裂局面，恢复了统一的印度尼西亚共和国，并且强烈地要求废除“圆桌会议协定”，并收复西伊里安。在这样的局势下，美国所耍的主要手段，是打起“中立”的招牌，操纵联合国，暗中支持荷兰继续非法霸占西伊里安。同时，它迫使印度尼西亚政府承担“马歇尔计划”的义务，签订“共同安全协定”，加紧经济上的渗透，逐步排挤荷兰和英国残存的殖民势力。
    但是，整个亚洲的局势愈来愈不利于帝国主义殖民势力。且不说美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上已碰得头破血流，被迫接受停战；就是它用大批美元和武器支持法国进行的印度支那战争，也同样遭到了惨重的失败。另一方面，特别是在1955年4月的亚非万隆会议和同年9月印度尼西亚的大选以后，印度尼西亚的民族独立力量获得重大发展，并于1956年4月全部废除了“圆桌会议协定”。八千四百万印度尼西亚人民更高地举起了反对殖民主义和捍卫民族独立的旗帜。这时，美帝国主义对印度尼西亚的侵略活动开始变得越发隐蔽，同时也越发阴险了。它企图以颠覆破坏活动来改变印度尼西亚的和平独立政策，从而把它拉进美国所操纵的军事集团。从1955年在幕后策动破坏大选的阴谋开始，直到1956年制造卢比斯政变、支持侯赛尼和西姆波朗的分裂活动等等，都是这种颠覆破坏阴谋的表现。等到1957年2月苏加诺公布救国方案，特别是同年12月印度尼西亚坚决开展反荷斗争前后，美帝国主义同印度尼西亚人民的矛盾更是空前地尖锐起来。美国的颠覆破坏也就更为毒辣，更加不择手段。它一面继续伪装“中立”，阻挠印度尼西亚实现收复西伊里安的要求，在西伊里安加紧建立军事基地；一面不惜采取各种卑鄙手段支持侯赛尼等叛乱集团，妄图推翻印度尼西亚共和国，使印度尼西亚人民放弃他们经过长期艰苦斗争赢得的独立。
    美国这一连串的侵略活动，无论“借刀杀人”也罢，颠覆破坏也罢，它的基本目的都是想把印度尼西亚这个富饶的国家放在它的支配之下，以便任意剥削和奴役印度尼西亚人民。现在，虽然美国还未能完全取代荷兰在印度尼西亚的残存的殖民势力，但是几年以来美国垄断资本的确已经步步渗进了印度尼西亚的重要经济领域。1957年美国在印度尼西亚的直接投资已增加到三亿五千万美元，占外国在印度尼西亚全部直接投资的15％，赶过了英国，仅次于荷兰，而居第二位。同时，在排挤老牌殖民主义的活动中，它已控制了英国和荷兰在印度尼西亚的相当一部分投资。在印度尼西亚的进出口贸易中，美国已凌驾于荷兰和英国之上，而占了第一位。美孚油公司、德士古石油公司及固特异橡胶与轮胎公司等大垄断企业，已在印度尼西亚的石油、橡胶、钢铁及有色金属等工业方面控制了很大一部分阵地。美国垄断资本还用“以利作本”的手段，每年提取25％的利润来作为新的投资，逐年在印度尼西亚的经济中伸展它的触角。很明显，美国垄断资本集团是不愿意看到印度尼西亚走上独立发展道路的。因此人们也就不难理解，为什么在印度尼西亚的美国垄断企业居然不顾国际法的起码原则，非法地勾结和支持印度尼西亚的叛乱集团。
    事实证明，印度尼西亚人民的反殖民主义斗争是同反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋分不开的。比起荷兰等老牌殖民主义者，印度尼西亚人民面对的这个敌人是更阴险毒辣的。但是，尽管它再隐蔽，再伪装，印度尼西亚人民还是能够识破美国这个新型殖民主义者的真面目。今天，反对美帝国主义的干涉，已成了印度尼西亚人民反对叛乱活动及整个反殖民主义斗争的重要环节。印度尼西亚人民有一句豪语：一旦自由，永远自由！已经站起来的印度尼西亚人民要求坚决捍卫自己的独立，继续沿着独立发展的道路前进，这是任何帝国主义的任何手段都阻挡不了的。
