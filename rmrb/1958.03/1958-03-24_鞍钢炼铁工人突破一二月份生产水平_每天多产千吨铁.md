Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 22nd: Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant workers are determined to learn new technologies and experiences, and have proposed a leap forward plan to produce more than 600,000 tons of pig iron this year than last year. In recent days, the plant's daily iron production has increased by about 1,000 tons compared to the average of January and February. Workers at Blast Furnace No. 3 have proposed reducing the effective volume of the blast furnace occupied per ton of pig iron from 0.66 cubic meters to 0.63 cubic meters this year, aiming to match the 0.625 target of Blast Furnace No. 8. Blast Furnace No. 5 has also set a three-step leap forward plan to match the utilization coefficient of 0.629 of the blast furnace at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union. Blast Furnace No. 9 proposed to catch up with Blast Furnace No. 3 in three months by combining technology and politics, and combining hard work and diligence.

Currently, ironmaking plant workers are determined to work hard for ten months to strive to achieve this year's overall pig iron production target.

    每天多产千吨铁
    新华社鞍山22日电　鞍钢炼铁厂职工决心学习新技术和新经验，提出今年比去年多生产六十多万吨生铁的跃进计划。近日来全厂每天所生产的铁比1月、2月份平均增加了一千吨左右。三号高炉工人提出在今年内做到每炼一吨生铁所占用的高炉有效容积由零点六六立方公尺降低到零点六三，并向八号高炉零点六二五的指标看齐。五号高炉也订出了跃进三步向苏联马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂高炉利用系数零点六二九看齐的计划。九号高炉提出技术加政治、干劲加钻劲，苦干三个月赶上三号高炉。
    目前，炼铁厂职工正决心苦战十个月争取实现今年生产生铁的总指标。
