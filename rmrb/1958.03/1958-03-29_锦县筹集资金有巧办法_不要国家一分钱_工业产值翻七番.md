This Dispatch from Shenyang, March 26th: How to solve the problem of funds for developing county-level industry? Jin County, Liaoning Province, has created a good method in this regard. The county proposed: do not ask the state for a single penny, but still set up a large number of factories and mines, so that this year's industrial output value will exceed the value of agricultural and sideline products.

The Jin County Party Committee proposed that this year's industrial output value should increase sevenfold, from only 18% of the value of agricultural and sideline products last year, to exceeding the value of agricultural and sideline products by 10%. The entire county should achieve "one-ization" (mechanization of grain and feed processing) and "seven self-sufficiencies" (self-sufficiency in coal, iron, salt, sugar, wine, edible oil, and processed by-products). The manufacturing and repair of small and medium-sized agricultural tools should also be basically resolved within the county. However, Jin County's original industrial base was very weak, with only eleven factories of various sizes. Last year, including handicrafts, the output value was only more than 8.3 million yuan. Not only could it not supply agricultural production tools, but even soy sauce and pickles had to be supplied from other places. When formulating the industrial development plan, many cadres believed that building so many factories and mines at once would be a major difficulty in terms of funding, and they all wanted to ask the state for money. At this time, the county party committee explained to these cadres: the state has many construction tasks in various fields. If we sit and wait for state investment, the industrial development plan will be disrupted or fall through. The county party committee decided to adopt the method of self-reliance within the county and relying on the masses to solve the problem of funds for industrial development.

The county party committee first decided to start with small industries that require less investment and yield quick results. This year, 494 small factories and mines will be newly built, costing only 2.85 million yuan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, a profit of 6 million yuan can be obtained. In this way, next year there will be capital to build nitrogen fertilizer plants, potassium chloride plants, and other factories and mines that require more investment.

This year's industrial construction investment in the county is being solved from four aspects. First, relying on the strength of the masses, everyone contributes money and everyone runs it. Many departments in the county have the strength to run industries and want to run industries, but in the past they were restricted because non-industrial departments could not run industries. Recently, the county party committee launched a major industrial opening, calling on all departments to voluntarily sign up to run industries in accordance with the county's industrial development plan. The county supply and marketing cooperative and service bureau immediately proposed to take out 150,000 yuan from the public welfare fund to engage in medicinal materials, papermaking, and non-staple food and aquatic product processing factories; the county handicraft cooperative proposed to take out 100,000 yuan from the public welfare fund and public accumulation fund to run four oil mills and ten sugar mills; many agricultural cooperatives also raised a sum of money from the public accumulation fund and sideline income, solving most of the investment in building 150 grain and feed processing plants, and they can organize more than 300 iron and wood joint factories without investment. Second, take the method of increasing production and practicing economy, compress the administrative office expenses of all agencies and schools in the county, and tap the potential of the original factories to accumulate funds for industrial development. More than 300,000 yuan can be taken out of the local financial expenditure to run industries. The original factories can also obtain more than 500,000 yuan in profits due to increased output, which can be used to build new factories. Third, concentrate scattered funds. From the trade union expenditures accumulated by various agencies, the remaining bonuses, and the temporarily idle funds of the aquatic product department during the off-season, more than 700,000 yuan was drawn and invested in industrial construction. Fourth, new factories gain profits to build new factories. The county plans to first build brick and tile factories, silica factories, and iron smelting plants, which require less investment and yield quick results. By the end of the second quarter, a profit of 210,000 yuan can be obtained, which can be used to build other factories.

    锦县筹集资金有巧办法
    不要国家一分钱　工业产值翻七番
    本报沈阳26日电　发展县工业的资金问题怎样解决？辽宁省锦县在这方面创造了好办法。这个县提出：不要国家一分钱，就要办起大批厂矿，使今年的工业产值赶过农副业产值。
    中共锦县县委提出今年要使工业产值翻七番，由去年只相当于农副业产值的18％，一跃超过农副业产值10％。全县要作到一化（粮谷饲料加工机械化），七自给（煤、铁、盐、糖、酒、食油、加工性副产品自给自足），中小型农具的制造和修配也要基本上由县内解决。但是，锦县原有的工业基础很薄弱，大大小小只有十一个工厂，去年连同手工业在内，产值不过八百三十多万元。不但农业生产用具不能供应，就连吃的酱油、小菜等也都要由外地供给。在制订工业发展规划的时候，许多干部认为一下要建这么多厂矿，资金来源是个大困难，都想伸手向国家要钱。这时，县委向这些干部说明：国家各方面建设任务很多，如果坐等国家投资，发展工业的规划就要被打乱或者落空。县委决定采取县内自力更生、依靠群众的办法，来解决发展工业的资金问题。
    县委首先决定从办投资少、收效快的小工业入手。今年要新建四百九十四个小厂矿，只花二百八十五万元，预计到年末可获利六百万元。这样，明年就有本钱建设需要投资较多的氮肥厂、氯化钾厂等厂矿。
    这个县今年工业建设的投资，是从四个方面来解决的。第一、依靠群众力量，大家拿钱，大家办。县内许多部门都有力量办工业，也想办工业，过去只是因为受到了非工业部门不能办工业的限制，所以没有办。最近，县委来了个搞工业大开放，号召各部门根据县工业发展规划，自愿报名办工业。县供销社和服务局马上提出要从公益金中拿出十五万元来搞药材、造纸和副食品、水产加工等工厂；县手工业联社提出要从公益金和公积金中拿出十万元办四个油厂、十个糖厂；许多农业社也从公积金和副业收入中凑出一笔资金，解决了建设一百五十个粮谷饲料加工厂的大部分投资，并且不需要投资自己就能组织起三百多个铁木联合工厂。第二、采取增产节约的办法，压缩县内一切机关、学校的行政办公等费用，发挥原有工厂的潜力，为发展工业积累资金。地方财政开支中可以拿出三十多万元来办工业。原有工厂因为增加产量，也可以多得利润五十多万元用来办新工厂。第三、集中零散资金。仅从各机关积存的工会开支、剩余的奖励金，以及水产部门生产淡季暂时闲置的资金等方面，就抽出七十多万元投入工业建设中去。第四、新厂得利建新厂。这个县准备先把投资少而收效快的缸瓦厂、硅石厂和炼铁厂办起来，到第二季度末就能得利二十一万元，可以用来建其他工厂。
