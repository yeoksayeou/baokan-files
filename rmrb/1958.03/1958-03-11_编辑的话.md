    Editor's Note
    Great Hope

    Having read the news of the leap-forward development of local industries in various places, a magnificent prospect immediately appears before us: within five, seven, or ten years, establishing a local industrial network that is native-grown and blossoms everywhere, making the output value of local industries surpass the local agricultural output value, is full of hope. Shaanxi, based on the principle of fundraising from the whole people and using local materials, aims to increase the total output value of local industries fivefold within five years. Shashi, Hubei, made a detailed calculation and can increase funding tenfold compared to the original plan within five years without asking the higher authorities for a single cent. Shuangbai County, Yunnan, is a poor county, and they have adopted the "rolling like a cow" method, using the profits from the first factories and mines to start new factories and mines. Are all these not vivid examples of "great hope"? Facts prove that as long as we fiercely oppose rightism, break through conservatism, and rely on the masses, hope is right in front of us, and the magnificent prospect will become a reality in the not-too-distant future.

    Example One

    An intense ideological exchange at the Institute of Geophysics, which achieved thorough criticism, clarified right and wrong, accepted opinions, and achieved sincere conviction, has led to a great leap forward in the thinking and work of many scientists. This is one of the successful examples of carrying out ideological struggle and ideological transformation among senior intellectuals.

    During the Double-Anti Movement, many intellectuals proactively proposed launching a competition movement to become both "red" and "expert." This initiative is extremely valuable. Science leadership organs in various places should actively support this initiative and learn from the experience of the Institute of Geophysics, using the large number of facts exposed in the Double-Anti Movement as a basis to organize them to conduct a thorough and detailed ideological criticism, which will be very beneficial. Through in-depth ideological criticism, clearing the bourgeois ideology of intellectuals, so that they can better serve the socialist scientific and cultural and educational undertakings, will be an indispensable aspect of promoting the rapid leap forward of various tasks in our country.

    大有希望
    看了各地地方工业飞跃发展的新闻，在我们面前立时呈现出一幅瑰丽的远景：在五年，或者七年，或者十年的时间内，建立一个根生土长、遍地开花的地方工业网，使地方工业的产值超过当地的农业产值，是大有希望的。陕西根据全民集资，就地取材的方针，要在五年内使地方工业总产值增长五倍；湖北沙市算了一笔细账，在五年内不要上级一分钱，资金却可以比原有计划增加十倍；云南双柏县是个穷县，他们采取“牛打滚”的办法，用先开办厂矿的利润来开办新的厂矿。这一切，不正是“大有希望”的生动例证吗？事实证明：只要我们狠狠地反掉右倾，攻破保守，依靠群众，希望就在眼前，瑰丽的远景就会在不远的将来变为现实。
    范例之一
    地球物理研究所一场激烈的思想交锋，达到了批判彻底，是非弄清，接受意见，心服口服，使很多科学家的思想大跃进，工作大跃进。这是在高级知识分子中开展思想斗争、进行思想改造的成功范例之一。
    在双反运动中，很多知识分子主动地提出了要开展一个红透专深的竞赛运动。这个倡议是极为可贵的。各地科学领导机关，应该积极地支持这一个倡议，并且学习地球物理研究所的经验，用双反运动中揭露出的大量事实为根据，组织他们进行一次深入细致的思想批判，这将是十分有益的。通过深入的思想批判，清除知识分子的资产阶级思想，使他们能够更好地为社会主义的科学事业和文教事业服务，这将是促进我国各项工作飞速跃进的不可缺少的一个方面。
