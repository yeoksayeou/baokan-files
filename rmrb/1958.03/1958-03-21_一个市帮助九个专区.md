    One Municipality Helps Nine Special Districts
    People still remember that newspapers once reported that Chongqing Municipality and the Zunyi Special District of Guizhou Province held a meeting to discuss assisting Zunyi Special District in developing local industries. Now, the scope of this assistance has been expanded. According to a front-page headline in the Chongqing Daily on the 15th, Chongqing Municipality also conducted similar consultations with nine special districts including Jiangjin and Neijiang in the province. Nearly one hundred small industrial enterprises will be established in these special districts, or jointly operated with special counties, or assisting special counties in construction.

    一个市帮助九个专区
    人们还记得报纸上曾经报道过，重庆市同贵州省的遵义专区开会商定，协助遵义专区兴办地方工业。现在，这种协助的范围又扩大了。据15日重庆日报一版头条报道，重庆市还和本省的江津、内江等九个专区进行了同样的协商。在这些专区兴办、或与专县合办、或协助专县建设近一百个小型工业企业。
