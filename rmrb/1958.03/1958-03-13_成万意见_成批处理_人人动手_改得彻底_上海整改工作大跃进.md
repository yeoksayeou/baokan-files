Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: Shanghai's anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, based on thorough and in-depth airing of views, has launched a high tide of large-scale rectification and transformation. Cadres and the masses are pushing the work on all fronts of the city to a new level with unprecedented revolutionary zeal. A situation of great leap forward in production and culture has already emerged in Shanghai.

This anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. More than 90% of the city's factories, government offices, schools, and stores have written big-character posters. The rectification movement in the neighborhoods has also been launched. Currently, more than 80 million big-character posters have been posted throughout the city, forming a mass citywide work inspection and a vigorous movement of criticism and self-criticism. Faced with such a situation, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly proposed to carry out rectification and transformation using the method of a great leap forward, resolutely implement the mass line, and achieve "tens of thousands of opinions, mass processing, everyone participates, and thorough transformation." Leading cadres, together with the masses, sorted out the big-character posters, distinguished between key issues and general issues, urgent and slow matters, and through mass analysis and debate, came up with improvement methods for each item, except for a few major issues. By adopting this method, the rectification and transformation were carried out quickly and well. Many departments handled 80% to 90% of the opinions raised by the masses within two or three days. The masses praised this movement as "airing views comfortably and rectifying thoroughly."

In this rectification, many units adopted the method of tackling the easy first and then the difficult, focusing on key issues to bring about a revolutionary leap forward in their work. State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 has always had a "rule" in production: increasing output would lead to a decrease in quality; conversely, improving quality would require reducing speed and output. This contradiction had not been resolved for several years. This time, the workers posted tens of thousands of big-character posters, most of which exposed backward and conservative phenomena in production. The leadership seized this key issue and launched a discussion among the workers. From offices to workshops, workers put forward thousands of ways to improve quality and increase output, so that by the end of February, the factory not only did not affect the quality but also produced superior yarn every day while production increased by 18%, solving the long-standing problem of both increasing production and improving quality.

In this high tide of rectification and transformation, the leadership style and working methods of leading cadres at all levels have undergone revolutionary improvements. From the leaders of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee to the leading cadres of various organs and factories, all went out of their offices, went down to the grassroots, and led the movement among the masses. Many district committees and professional bureaus have sent 80% to 90% of their cadres to the grassroots to rectify themselves while helping the grassroots to rectify. Factories and government offices have widely adopted the leadership method of holding on-site meetings.

Wherever the movement is thoroughly opposed and rectified, production and work are焕然一新 (completely renewed). Now, the production targets of many factories have increased by multiples, and miracles are emerging every day. The local electromechanical industry, which accounts for about one-sixth of Shanghai's total industrial output value, has seen its production targets jump six or seven times since the beginning of the year, from a 9% increase over last year to a 116% increase, and may still increase further.

Tens of millions of big-character posters have also given a new look to the cultural departments. The Shanghai People's Art Theatre, which has always been plagued by a shortage of scripts, has created six living newspapers in a few days, and musicians have composed more than 200 songs. Students from the Conservatory of Music and its affiliated middle school also went to the streets, fields, and amusement places to perform. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, which used to be the most "delicate," also went to factories and played for workers in the dining hall. Even the libraries, which had always been "calm," extended their opening hours in the movement using the method of "let the people not rest, the library does not rest", which is equivalent to adding more than ten large libraries to the city.

### 成万意见　成批处理　人人动手　改得彻底  上海整改工作大跃进

    成万意见　成批处理　人人动手　改得彻底
    上海整改工作大跃进
    据新华社上海12日电　上海的反浪费反保守运动，在放得深放得透的基础上，又掀起了大整大改的高潮。干部和群众正以空前未有的革命干劲，把全市各条战线的工作推向一个新的水平。一个生产大跃进和文化大跃进的局面目前已经在上海出现。
    这次反浪费反保守运动深入人心，全市的工厂、机关、学校、商店有百分之九十几以上的人都写了大字报。里弄的整风运动也已经推开。目前，全市贴出的大字报已达八千多万张，形成了一次群众性的全市工作大检查和一个声势浩大的批评与自我批评运动。面对着这样的形势，中共上海市委及时提出要用大跃进的方法来进行整改，坚决贯彻群众路线，做到“成万意见，成批处理，人人动手，改得彻底”。领导干部就和群众一起把大字报分类整理，分清关键问题和一般问题，急办的和缓办的，通过群众分析、争辩，除若干重大问题外，逐个得出改进办法。采用这种方法，使整改进行得又快又好，许多部门在两三天内就使群众提出的意见的百分之八、九十都得到了处理。群众称赞这次运动是“放得舒服，改得痛快”。
    在这一次整改中，许多单位采取先易后难、猛攻关键的方法，使工作来一个革命的跃进。国棉一厂历来生产中有一条“规律”：产量提高，质量就要降低，反过来，要提高质量，就要降低车速，减少产量。这个矛盾几年来没有得到解决。这次职工贴出了几万张大字报，大部分是揭发生产中的落后保守现象。领导上就抓住这个关键问题发动职工展开讨论。从科室到车间，职工们提出了成千上万条提高质量、增加产量的办法，使这个厂2月底在产量猛增18％的情况下，不但没有影响质量，还天天出现优级纱，解决了既增产又提高质量这个长期没有解决的问题。
    在这次整改高潮中，各级领导干部的领导作风和工作方法有了革命性的改进。从中共市委、市人民委员会的负责人，到各机关、工厂的领导干部，都走出办公室，下到基层，到群众中去领导运动。很多区委和专业局都把百分之八、九十的干部放到基层，一面自己整风，同时帮助基层整风。工厂和机关都广泛采用了召开现场会议的领导方法。
    凡是在运动中反得透、改得狠的地方，生产、工作都面目一新。现在，许多工厂的生产指标成倍、几倍地增加，奇迹每天都在涌现。占上海工业总产值大约六分之一的地方机电工业，生产指标从年初到现在跳了六、七次，从比去年增加9％跳到116％，并且可能还要提高。
    千万张大字报也使文化部门面貌一新。一向闹剧本荒的上海人民艺术剧院，在几天内已创作了六个活报剧，音乐家已作了二百多首歌曲。音乐学院和附中的学生，还到街头、田间和游艺场所去演唱。过去最“娇”的上海交响乐团也下了工厂，在饭厅里为工人演奏。连一向“风平浪静”的图书馆，工作人员也在运动中用息人不息馆的办法，延长了开放时间，等于全市增加了十个以上的大型图书馆。
