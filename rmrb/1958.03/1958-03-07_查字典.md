    Looking Up Dictionaries
    Yang Chunxu
    I have enjoyed looking up dictionaries since I was a child. I once learned the radical lookup method, the stroke count lookup method, and the four-corner code lookup method. However, even now, I am not very satisfied with these three lookup methods. Take the radical lookup method, for example. There are more than one hundred and eighty radicals in Chinese characters, which are difficult for people to become familiar with. It is even more difficult to fully grasp its rules. It is not like foreign language dictionaries, which are arranged alphabetically, which is both simple and rigorous. Looking up words is fast; if it exists, it exists; if it doesn't, it doesn't—it's clear at a glance. Sometimes, a Chinese character cannot be found under one radical, and cannot be found under another. Sometimes, one is even unsure whether the character is not in the dictionary or whether the lookup method is incorrect. Much time is spent, but the efficiency is very low. Then, take the four-corner code lookup method. Because Chinese character shapes are complex, it is not easy to encode them correctly. Moreover, there are many special rules in the encoding method, which are also difficult to remember and easy to forget after learning. Therefore, this lookup method often disappoints people.
    Recently, I browsed through the "Xinhua Dictionary" (Commercial Press, first edition, June 1957). Because it is arranged according to "phonetic order," it is relatively convenient to use. However, I also feel that there is a flaw. The main reason is that its phonetic order is arranged according to the order of "phonetic symbols," i.e., ㄅ, ㄆ, ㄇ, ㄈ... (of course, it had to be arranged that way before the official publication of the Hanyu Pinyin scheme), so there are still more complexities. But despite this, this dictionary is still very likable.
    Now, the Latin alphabet-based Hanyu Pinyin scheme has been approved by the National People's Congress. This scheme has many uses. It will also play a significant role in the issue of compiling dictionaries. If a new Chinese dictionary, mainly using the phonetic order lookup method, is edited using the fixed order of the twenty-six letters in the Hanyu Pinyin scheme, it will have fewer complexities, a clear system, be simple and clear, and have fast lookup speed. It will surely be welcomed by the broad masses of people.
    People look up words in two situations: one is "knowing the pronunciation but not knowing the meaning"; the other is knowing neither the pronunciation nor the meaning. In the former case, the phonetic order lookup method is the fastest and most efficient. The latter case is more complicated, but it is not difficult for primary and secondary school students, because many characters in primary and secondary school language textbooks will be annotated with Hanyu Pinyin letters. Once the pronunciation is annotated, the second situation will naturally not exist. It is also not difficult for adults who are learning to read and write, because they will also use annotated Chinese textbooks, and the words they need to look up in the dictionary are mostly those for which they know the pronunciation but not the meaning. Nevertheless, the new dictionary, mainly using the phonetic order lookup method, should also meet the needs of both the former and the latter. I think that with our own scientific phonetic alphabet today, with the whole nation promoting writing reform today, and with the active efforts of experts, a perfect Chinese dictionary using the phonetic order lookup method will surely be compiled, making the dictionary a truly effective tool in the cultural life of our people. The emergence of this truly scientific and efficient Chinese dictionary is one of the inevitable results of the development of Chinese writing reform.

    查字典
    杨春旭
    我从小就喜欢查字典。曾经学过部首检字法、笔数检字法和四角号码检字法。但是直到现在，我对这三种检字法都不很满意。拿部首检字法来说吧，汉字的部首就有一百八十多个，很难使人熟悉。要全部掌握它的规律就更加困难了，不像外文字典是按字母次序排列，既简明、又严密；检字快，有就有，没有就没有，一目了然。有时一个汉字在这个部首查查没有，在那个部首查一查又没有，有时甚至不敢断定是字典里没有呢，还是查的方法不对。费的时间多，效率却很低。再拿四角号码检字法来说吧，由于汉字字形复杂，编号不容易编得正确。并且在编号的方法上有不少的特殊规定，也很难得记住，学会了又容易忘记。因此，这种检字法也往往使人失望。
    最近，翻了翻“新华字典”（1957年6月商务新一版），由于它是按照“音序”排列的，所以使用起来比较方便。但是也觉美中不足。主要是由于它的音序是按“注音字母”的次序，即ㄅ、ㄆ、ㄇ、ㄈ……排列的，不是按a、b、c、d……排列（在汉语拼音方案正式公布之前，当然也只好那么排了），所以头绪还显多些。但是尽管如此，这种字典还是使人很喜爱。
    现在，拉丁字母式的汉语拼音方案已经由全国人民代表大会批准了。这个方案的用处是很多的。就在编字典这个问题上也将起到很大的作用。如果用汉语拼音方案中的二十六个字母的固定次序编辑新的以音序检字法为主的汉语字典，头绪少、系统分明、简单明了、检字快，一定会受到广大人民的欢迎。
    人们检字有两种情况，一是“知其音而不知其意”；一种是既不知音，也不知意。前一种情况，用音序检字法最快，效率也最高。后一种情况就比较复杂，但是对中、小学生也并不难，因为中、小学语文课本上的许多字将会用汉语拼音字母来注音，既注了音，当然就不会有第二种情况了。对于正在识字、学文化的成年人也并不难，因为他们也将使用注音的汉语课本，需要查字典的字也是知其音而不知其意的多。尽管如此，以音序检字法为主的新字典也应该同时满足前者和后者两种需要。我想，在有了我们自己的科学的拼音字母的今天，在全国人民都促进文字改革的今天，在专家的积极努力下，一定会编出完美的音序检字的汉语字典来，使字典成为我国人民文化生活中的真正有效的工具。这种真正科学的效率高的汉语字典的出现，是中国文字改革工作发展的必然结果之一。
