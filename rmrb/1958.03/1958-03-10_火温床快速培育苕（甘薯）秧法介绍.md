Introduction to the Quick Hotbed Method for Cultivating Sweet Potato Seedlings

I. Making a Hotbed

(1) Hotbed Area and Placement: The northeastern side should be 7 feet long with a 3-foot-high wall. The southwestern wall should be 1.2 feet high and 7 feet long. The northwestern side should be the same height as the high wall (3 feet high, 5 feet long). The southeastern side should be 5 feet long and sloped.

(2) Constructing the Fire Hole and Flue: After the four walls are built, dig a fire hole at the bottom (on the southwestern low wall), level with the wall base. Dig an arched fire door 1.5 feet wide and 1.8 feet high, extending 2.6 feet into the bed. Then, below the fire hole, dig a 5-inch deep and 6-inch wide ditch as an ash channel, connected to the fire hole. Construct two flues connected to the fire eye (in the middle of the bed), one going to the upper right corner (a concealed flue), and one going to the left. The left flue should split into two 1.5 feet away from the transverse wall (northwest side), one going to the upper left corner and one to the lower left corner. The flues should be 6 inches wide and gradually become shallower, forming a sloping ditch, about 9 inches deep from the fire hole bridge to the corner near the chimney.

(3) Installing the Furnace Bridge: After the flues are constructed, install the furnace bridge. First, break two tiles in half and use mud to coat both sides of the ash channel. Then, place three tiles face up at the junction of the flue and the fire hole, with three more placed face up towards the low wall. Install the furnace bridge in the middle and cover it with mud.

(4) Test Firing and Sealing the Fire Hole and Flues: After installing the furnace bridge, let it dry and then start a fire. Immediately cover the fire hole with sand and stones and seal it with mud to prevent any fire or smoke from escaping (during combustion, check the flues for open flames; if any, cover them with more sand and stones).

(5) Building the Chimney: Do not install a chimney in the upper right corner (it's a concealed flue). Use a long chimney for the upper left corner, using tiles at the bottom. Place the back of the tiles facing the bed, against the middle of the two wall corners, and seal with mud to prevent smoke leakage. These two chimneys should protrude 5 to 6 inches above the wall.

(6) Making the Mat Support: Use tough yellow bamboo to saw five pieces that are 7 feet long and eight pieces that are 5 feet long. Place the long ones on top and the short ones below to form a bamboo frame.

(7) Laying Sorghum Straw: Spread a layer of sorghum straw evenly on the bamboo frame (ensure it's level and has no gaps).

(8) Covering with Large Reed Mats: Place two 3.5-foot reed mats side by side to cover the entire bed surface, and apply a thin layer of mud. Pay attention to sealing the joints where the mats meet the walls to prevent smoke leakage.

(9) Adding Cultivation Soil (i.e., Bed Soil): Use 10% compost mixed with 90% loam (do not use soil that has been used to grow sweet potatoes in the past two years), and add a small amount of chemical fertilizer: (A) 5 catties of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer, or 2 catties of urea, or 3 catties of ammonium sulfate; (B) 20 catties of firewood ash; (C) 1 catty of lime. Mix well and place in the bed, filling it to a thickness of about 4 inches (or 3.5 inches or more). This completes the construction of the hotbed (also called a heated bed).

II. Heating and Placing Sweet Potato Seeds

Heating: First, use an open fire (i.e., do not close the fire door) to heat the cultivation soil to about 25 degrees Celsius to prepare for planting the sweet potato seeds. Placing Sweet Potato Seeds:

(1) First, select healthy, undamaged sweet potato seeds and process them by cutting off the top and bottom ends to check for white sap. If no sap appears, the seed cannot be used. (2) Disinfect the cut surfaces with wood ash. (3) Place the sweet potatoes in the soil, distinguishing between the top and bottom ends, using 6 to 8 catties of sweet potatoes per square meter. Lay them flat; for longer ones, dig a hole underneath; for shorter ones, pad them with bed soil. (4) Cover the sweet potatoes with 3 to 4 fen of sand. (5) Water with warm water (40 to 45 degrees Celsius). (6) Cover with another layer of fine sand, about 3 to 4 fen thick.

Covering: Cover the hotbed again: (1) Cover with glass windows and bamboo branches; (2) Cover with straw mats; (3) Cover with shading mats or drying mats.

III. Hotbed Management

(1) Continuous Heating: The normal temperature is 24 to 28 degrees Celsius. During heating, when the bed temperature rises to 33 degrees, the fire can be temporarily extinguished to allow the bed temperature to drop to 20 to 22 degrees, and then heating can be resumed. If the bed temperature drops below 18 degrees, immediately burn an open fire, and when the temperature reaches about 25 degrees, switch to a concealed fire. (2) Checking the Bed Temperature: Check eight times a day: at dawn, after breakfast, before lunch, at 3 or 4 pm, at dusk, at 9 pm, at 12 am (midnight), and before dawn (around 3 am, this is the most important) for a total of eight times.

IV. Uncovering and Covering

(1) The cover can remain closed for the first ten days after planting. (2) When the sweet potatoes sprout, remove the shading mats and straw mats during the day, leaving the glass windows in place; cover well at night. (3) When green leaves begin to emerge, carry out low-temperature hardening. Do not remove the glass windows; uncover later in the morning and cover earlier in the afternoon, then uncover earlier and cover later; and finally, do not cover at all. However, always cover during the eighth bed temperature check (at 3 am). (4) Pay attention to rodent control.

V. Transplanting Sweet Potato Seedlings

(1) After "Jingzhe" (惊蛰, Awakening of Insects) and before "Chunfen" (春分, Vernal Equinox), when the seedlings are about 6 to 7 inches long, transplant them to the seedling field (long seedlings can be cut into two sections for planting), planting 9,000 to 10,000 square nests per mu, with two seedlings per nest. (2) The seedling field should be sunny and heavily fertilized as a base. (3) After planting, apply clear manure water every 5 to 6 days. For the second and third applications, use fast-acting chemical fertilizers to promote seedling growth. After Guyu (谷雨, Grain Rain), vines can be cut and transplanted. (4) A bed that is 7 feet long and 5 feet wide can cultivate 250 catties of sweet potatoes (approximately 1,000 sweet potatoes, each weighing 4 liang), which can plant 1.5 to 2 mu of seedling field. Every 100 catties of sweet potato seeds can plant 20 mu.

    火温床快速培育苕（甘薯）秧法介绍
    一、火温床的作法
    （1）火温床的面积及床位安置：东北方的一面长七尺，筑墙高三尺，西南方的墙高一点二尺长七尺。西北方与高墙一齐高（高三尺长五尺），东南方长五尺作成斜面。
    （2）做灶眼火路：四方的墙筑好后，在床底子上挖灶眼（西南方矮墙），与墙基成水平，挖一点五尺宽、一点八尺高的拱型火门，挖进床内二点六尺，再在火眼下面挖一深五寸、宽六寸的沟作为灰道。连在火眼上（即床中间）修二条火路，一条往右上角（暗火路），一条往左走。左边的一条到距横墙（西北方）的一点五尺处分为两路，一往左上角，一往左下角。火路宽六寸，越走越挖浅一些，成一斜沟，从火眼炉桥到角上接近烟筒为九寸深。
    （3）安装炉桥：火路修通后就安装炉桥，先用二匹瓦对破，用泥涂灰道两侧，然后仰叠三匹瓦置火路和火眼接头处，以三匹仰叠置于靠矮墙方向，再把炉桥安在中间，涂上泥。
    （4）试烧和盖好火眼火路：安好炉桥后，晾干水气发火，并立即在火眼上盖上沙石，涂好泥，使不露火不透烟子（燃烧时，看火路上有无明火，如有再盖上沙石）。
    （5）修烟筒：右上角不要烟筒（是一暗火路），左上角用长烟筒，但下面用瓦，把瓦背向床内靠在两墙角的中间，用泥涂上，不使透烟。这两个烟筒以露出墙头五、六寸较好。
    （6）做垫架：用硬头黄竹锯成七尺长的五根，每根五尺长的八根，长的放在上面、短的放在下面，扎成竹架。
    （7）垫高粱秸：在竹架上平铺一层高粱秸（要垫平不要留空隙）。
    （8）垫上大篾折子：两块三点五尺的折子并列起把整个床面盖完，涂一层薄泥，注意折子四方与墙接头处，要涂的不透烟子。
    （9）放上培养土（即床泥）：用10％的堆肥加上90％的壤土（不要用去年和前年栽过红苕的泥土），混合少许化学肥：（甲）氮磷肥五斤或二斤尿素或三斤硫酸錏；（乙）柴灰二十斤；（丙）石灰一斤。混合好后放入床内，填成厚约四寸（或三点五寸以上）的培养土。这样，就筑成火温床了（也叫烧炕温床）。
  二、加温放苕种
    加温：先要加明火（即不关火门），把培养土烧烘到二十五度左右（摄氏，下同）以便下种红苕。放入苕种：
    （1）先选好无病无伤的苕种，进行处理，把红苕上下端切割去，看切口有无白浆冒出，若无即不能用。（2）进行切口消毒：用柴灰涂切口处。（3）安苕入土：分清上下端，每平方公尺放六至八斤红苕，要放平，长的把下面挖一下，短的垫些床泥。（4）放苕后上面盖上三至四分沙土。（5）浇以温水（四十至四十五度）（6）再盖一层细沙，厚约三至四分。
    复盖：温床上再行复盖：（1）罩上玻璃窗、搭上竹枝；（2）盖上草垫；（3）盖上挡折或晒垫。
    三、温床管理
    （1）继续加温：正常温度是二十四度至二十八度。加温中注意床温上升到三十三度时，可以暂时把火熄一下，使床温降到二十至二十二度，然后再加温；如果床温下降到十八度以下，应立即烧明火，温度到二十五度左右，再烧暗火。（2）检查床温：每天查八次：即黎明、早饭后、午饭前、下午三四时、黄昏、晚上九时、十二时（半夜）、天明前（即三时左右，这次最重要）共八次。
    四、揭盖复盖
    （1）下种后十来天可以不揭盖。（2）苕出顶芽时，白天要揭去晒垫草垫，把玻璃窗留下；晚上要盖好。（3）开始出青叶时，要进行低温锻炼，就是玻璃窗也不把盖揭开；上午揭晚一点，下午早一点盖，然后是早揭、晚盖；最后是不加盖。但任何时候在第八次查床温时都要加盖（即夜间三时）。（4）必须注意鼠害。
    五、移栽苕苗
    （1）“惊蛰”后，“春分”前苗约六、七寸，即移到采苗地内（长苗子每根可切成两节栽），每亩栽九千至一万的见方窝子，每窝二株。（2）采苗地要向阳，要重施底肥。（3）栽后要每五至六天上一次清粪水，第二、三次可施速效的化肥，以便提苗，谷雨后即可剪藤移栽。（4）七尺长五尺宽的床可育二百五十斤苕和（约一千个红苕，每个重四两）可栽一亩半到两亩采苗地，每一百斤苕种可栽二十亩。　（新华社专稿）
