Xinhua News Agency, An Guo, 25th. The on-site promotion meeting for wheat field management in An Guo County, jointly organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Hebei Province, greatly promoted the enthusiasm of various regions to strive for increased summer production. Representatives from Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Gansu, and more than 40 counties in Hebei Province, including Zhengding, Gaocheng, Hejian, and Renqiu, said after the visit: An Guo County has a strong atmosphere of great leap forward, full of enthusiasm from top to bottom, concrete leadership measures, and many methods for managing wheat fields. Upon entering An Guo, one feels an extraordinary atmosphere.

The on-site promotion meeting for wheat field management held in An Guo County, Hebei Province, lasted a week and ended on the 23rd. The representatives listened to the report by Liu Zhenzong, Secretary of the An Guo County Party Committee, on leading this year's great leap forward in production and crossing the Yellow River in the wheat season. They visited the wheat field management in Nanloudi, Wurenqiao, Qigong, Donghe and other villages in An Guo County, and held discussions to exchange information, measures and methods on how various regions organize and lead wheat field management to strive for a bumper summer harvest.

Starting in late February, An Guo County shifted from a high tide of large-scale water conservancy construction, large-scale fertilizer accumulation, and large-scale land turning to a heated high tide of wheat field management, striving for a bumper harvest in the wheat season. The slogan is "Work hard for a hundred days, cross the Yellow River in the wheat season." An Guo's total grain output last year was more than 150 million jin, with a yield of more than 464 jin per mu, already crossing the Yellow River. This year, they proposed to strive to become a "thousand-jin county," and take striving for a leap forward in wheat season production as the first and decisive battle to achieve the "thousand-jin county." An Guo currently has 205,000 mu of wheat and barley. They strive to create more than 50,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields with a yield of a thousand jin, eliminate low-yield wheat fields with a yield of less than 250 jin, achieve an average yield of 400 jin per mu, and a total output of 82 million jin. In addition to the more than 250,000 mu of intercropped early-maturing crops expanded this year (including 72,000 mu of spring wheat and barley, broad beans, and peas, which were basically sown in early March), they want to strive for this summer's grain harvest to be equivalent to the total output of last year.

Now, the entire An Guo County is resolutely striving to win a beautiful battle in the wheat season with the belief of certain victory. The county, townships, and agricultural cooperatives have all established specialized lines to lead wheat field management, led by Sun Dongchuan, the second secretary of the county party committee, and the party secretaries of each township and cooperative are also personally in charge. When the rain started and the earth began to thaw, An Guo County mobilized the masses to suppress and harrow the wheat fields, even when the surface was frozen. Except for alkaline land that was not suppressed and sandy land that was not harrowed, the wheat fields throughout the county were generally suppressed and harrowed two or three times to increase ground temperature and preserve moisture. Then, in late February and early March (before the Awakening of Insects), the first watering and topdressing in the spring was generally carried out, and shallow hoeing and checking for missing seedlings were also launched. Now the wheat seedlings have returned to green and are growing well. All wheat fields in the county have been assigned to specialized groups and personnel for management by the agricultural cooperatives, with dedicated personnel responsible for each plot. Among them, more than 90,000 mu of first-class seedlings with strong growth, fertile land, and fine sowing have all been designated as high-yield fields. In addition to creating 50,000 mu of "thousand-jin wheat," the rest are required to produce more than 800 jin per mu. These wheat fields have all been contracted to the specialized management groups by the agricultural cooperatives according to a fixed output of 800 jin, and the time, quantity, quality, and reward system for topdressing and watering have been stipulated. For the 35,000 mu of secondary wheat that did not grow well due to late sowing and other reasons, An Guo County put forward the slogan "March towards secondary wheat and eliminate secondary wheat." Agricultural cooperatives also stipulated detailed measures to strengthen late-stage management and strive for a bumper harvest of secondary wheat. For general wheat fields, An Guo County proposed five waterings and three fertilizings (excluding the watering and fertilization last winter) and three times of intertillage. Now the whole county is continuing to water and topdress the wheat fields. More than 300 water pumps are running day and night, and most of the waterwheels on the wells are also running non-stop day and night. Red flags are everywhere in the fields during the day, and lights are everywhere at night.

During the visit, representatives from various regions visited the high-yield wheat fields in agricultural cooperatives such as Nanloudi, visited the wheat fields where the cooperatives made comparative experiments on varieties, fertilization, and sowing dates, visited the experimental fields of County Party Secretary Sun Dongchuan and township and cooperative cadres, and also visited the management of secondary wheat in each cooperative. During the visit, many representatives inquired in detail about the sowing conditions and management measures of the wheat fields, inspected the growth and tillering of wheat seedlings, and copied many of the "person in charge and management measures" signs inserted at the head of the high-yield fields. They saw the endless wheat fields with flat soil and neat ridges, and the green wheat seedlings that had returned to green, and all believed that these wheat fields would definitely increase production.

At the end of the meeting, Gu Dachuan, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, pointed out: This on-site visit will help to further overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and strive to make a great leap forward in the wheat season. He asked all regions to conduct a general inspection of the wheat fields as soon as possible, immediately take supplementary measures, make full use of the superior conditions of water and fertilizer, seize the high-yield wheat fields, eliminate the third-class seedlings, and also launch a fierce battle for three months to strive for a bumper summer harvest.

The first branch of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Renhuai County, Guizhou Province, launched a large-scale campaign towards barren mountains and bad waters last year. By the end of January this year, it had turned hundreds of acres of slopes into terraces and planted wheat. This is a picture of the members weeding.

    麦田管理抓两头  安国经验传八省
    一头创造丰产田  一头消灭低产田
    新华社安国25日电　农业部和河北省联合组织的、参观安国县的麦田管理现场促进会，把各地争取夏季增产的干劲大大促进了一步。山东、山西、河南、安徽、江苏、陕西、甘肃等省，和河北省正定、藁城、河间、任丘等四十多县的代表，参观后都说：安国县跃进气氛浓厚，上下干劲十足，领导措施具体，管理麦田办法很多，一进入安国境内就感到气象非凡。
    在河北省安国县举行的麦田管理现场促进会，开会一周，已经在23日结束。代表们听了中共安国县委书记刘振宗的关于领导今年生产大跃进、麦季渡黄河的报告，参观了安国县南楼底、伍仁桥、七公、东河等乡的麦田管理，又举行了座谈，交流了各地组织领导麦田管理争取夏季丰收的情况、措施和办法。
    安国县2月下旬开始，就从大修水利、大积肥、大翻地的高潮，转入了热火朝天的小麦田间管理、争取麦季大丰收的高潮。口号是“苦干一百天，麦季过黄河”。安国去年粮食总产量是一亿五千多万斤，亩产达到四百六十四斤多，已经渡过了黄河。今年他们又提出要争取成为千斤县；而把争取麦季生产跃进，作为实现千斤县的第一个有决定意义的战役。安国现有大小麦二十万五千亩，他们争取创造五万亩以上的千斤高额丰产麦田，消灭二百五十斤以下的低产麦田，平均亩产四百斤，总产量达到八千二百万斤。加上今年扩大种植的二十五万多亩间作早熟作物（其中七万二千亩春大小麦和蚕豆、豌豆，已在3月上旬基本播种完毕），要争取今年夏收的粮食相当于去年全年的总产量。
    现在安国全县上下都在必胜的信念下，坚决争取在麦季打个漂亮仗。县、乡和农业社都建立了专门领导麦田管理的战线，由县委第二书记孙东川负责，各乡、社也都由党的书记亲自抓。在雨水节大地开始化冻时，安国县就发动群众顶凌压麦、耙麦。全县麦田除碱地不压、沙地不耙外，普遍压、耙了两三遍，以提高地温和保墒。接着2 月底3月初（惊蛰节前），又普遍进行了开春第一次浇水追肥，同时发动了浅锄和查补缺苗。现在麦苗已经返青，生长良好。全县麦田已都由农业社指定专组专人管理，块块有专人负责。其中九万多亩地壮肥大播种精细的一类苗，已经全部定为丰产田，除创造五万亩千斤麦外，其余都要求亩产八百斤以上。这些麦田都由农业社按八百斤的定产包给了专管组，规定了追肥和浇水的时间、数量、质量和奖励制度等等。对三万五千亩由于播种晚等原因生长不够好的次麦，安国县提出了“向次麦进军，消灭次麦”的口号，各农业社也规定了加强后期管理力争次麦丰收的精细措施。对一般麦田，安国县提出了五水三肥（不包括去冬的浇水施肥）、中耕三次的要求。现在全县还在继续给麦田浇返青水和追肥。三百多台抽水机正在日夜开动，大部分井上水车也日夜不停。原野上白天处处是红旗，夜里到处有灯光。
    这次各地代表在南楼底等农业社参观了丰产麦田，参观了各社所作的关于品种、施肥、播种期等对比试验的麦田，参观了县委书记孙东川和乡社干部的试验田，也参观了各社对次麦的管理。参观中，许多代表详细地访问了麦田的播种情况和管理措施，察看了麦苗的生长和分蘖情况，抄记了许多丰产田地头上插的“负责人和管理措施”牌子。他们看到一望无际的麦田地平土细，畦沟整齐，返青的麦苗已经一片青绿，无不相信这些麦田一定能够增产。
    会议结束时，农业部副部长顾大川指出：这次实地参观有助于进一步克服右倾保守思想，争取打响麦季跃进这一炮。他要求各地从速对麦田作一次普遍检查，立即采取补充措施，充分利用水和肥料的优越条件，抓住丰产麦田，消灭三类苗，也来一个鏖战三个月，力争夏季大丰收。（附图片）
