A technical force has emerged in the rural areas of Guangdong Province. This team played a huge role in this year's spring plowing production upsurge.

This spring, technician training classes were generally held throughout Guangdong. In the Shantou area alone, 100,000 people were trained this spring, and more than 20,000 people were trained in Chao'an County alone.

Driven by this technical force, in the spring plowing production, the tide of technological reform surged from the plains into the mountainous areas where even primitive farming systems remained. In Suixi and Haikang counties on the Leizhou Peninsula, where farming techniques were backward, sowing fields were eliminated for the first time this spring and replaced with sowing and rice seedling cultivation, and advanced techniques were comprehensively promoted. Banba Agricultural Cooperative, located deep in the Shiwan Mountains and composed of farmers from the Zhuang, Yao, and Han ethnic groups, also abandoned the primitive slash-and-burn cultivation system this spring and adopted advanced technologies. Many farmer technicians in the high-yield grain area of ​​the Chaoshan Plain also went to low-yield areas to serve as consultants.

    广东农民技术员大显身手
    本报讯　广东省农村中出现了一支技术大军。这个队伍在今年春耕生产高潮中发挥了巨大作用。
    今春广东各地普遍举办技术员训练班。仅汕头专区今春就训练了十万人，潮安一个县训练了二万多人。
    在这支技术队伍的带动下，在春耕生产中，技术改革的浪潮从平原涌进了甚至残存着原始耕作制度的山区。耕作技术落后的雷州半岛上的遂溪、海康等县，今春破天荒地消灭了撒种田，改为播种育秧，全面推广先进技术。深处十万大山、由僮、瑶、汉三个民族的农民组成的板八农业社，今春也抛弃了刀耕火种的原始耕作制度，采用先进技术。高产粮区潮汕平原的许多农民技术员，还到低产区去担任顾问。
