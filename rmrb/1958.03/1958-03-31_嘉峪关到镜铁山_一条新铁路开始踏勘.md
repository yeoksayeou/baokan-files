Jiayuguan to Jingtieshan
A New Railway Begins Surveying

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 30th. Surveying has begun on the railway from Jiayuguan, west of Jiuquan, to the Jingtieshan Iron Mine. This railway is a preliminary project for the construction of China's new large-scale iron and steel complex, with a total length of approximately one hundred kilometers. Surveying and design will be carried out this year, and it will be completed next year.

The Jingtieshan Iron Mine is located in the Qilian Mountains west of Jiayuguan, with an altitude difference of one thousand meters between the two places. After the railway under survey is built, it will connect with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in Jiayuguan. Construction materials transferred from the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway can then go directly to the mining area. Tens of thousands of tons of iron ore will also be transported to the iron and steel plant via the railway.

    嘉峪关到镜铁山
    一条新铁路开始踏勘
    据新华社兰州30日电　从酒泉以西的嘉峪关通向镜铁山铁矿的铁路已开始踏勘。这条铁路是建设我国新的大型钢铁联合企业的先行工程，全长约一百公里，今年进行勘测设计，明年修通。
    镜铁山大铁矿在嘉峪关西面的祁连山里，两地拔海高度相差一千公尺。正在踏勘的铁路修建起来后，将在嘉峪关同兰新铁路相衔接，从兰新路转运来的建筑器材就可以直上铁矿区；成千上万吨的铁矿石，也要通过铁路运往炼铁厂。
