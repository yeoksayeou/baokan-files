A Beneficial Lesson

Some members of the British Labour Party oppose the establishment of American intermediate-range missile bases in Britain, which has aroused the anger of the editors of the American "New York Herald Tribune." In an editorial on March 2, this newspaper openly advocated that British Labour Party leader Gaitskell should take "punitive measures" against those so-called "anti-leadership elements" within the Labour Party.

As the mouthpiece of the American ruling group, the "New York Herald Tribune" is interfering so unscrupulously in the internal affairs of the British political party, which is rather arrogant.

However, this may not be a beneficial lesson for the leading figures of the British Labour Party. Can't they see who supports and welcomes their attitude on the issue of establishing American intermediate-range missile bases in Britain?

    有益的一课
    英国工党的一些议员反对在英国设置美国的中程导弹基地，这件事情引起了美国“纽约先驱论坛报”的编者的肝火。这家报纸在3月2日的一篇社论中，公然主张英国工党领袖盖次克尔应该对那些所谓的工党的“反领导派”采取“处罚方法”。
    作为美国统治集团的喉舌，
  “纽约先驱论坛报”竟然对英国政党内部的事务进行如此毫无顾忌的干预，这未免狂妄的有些太过分了。
    不过，这对于英国工党的领导人物倒未尝不是有益的一课。难道他们还看不出，他们在关于在英国设置美国中程导弹基地问题上的态度，只能得到谁的支持和欢迎吗？
