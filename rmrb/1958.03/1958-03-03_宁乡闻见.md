    Ningxiang Accounts
    Zhou Libo
    The car arrived in Ningxiang, and it was drizzling, with distant mountains appearing as dim outlines. The road was all yellow mud. The bordering fields had all been plowed. The red clover was growing very well. On the whitewashed wall of a small house was a slogan written in ink: "Pig manure and red clover, two treasures for fertilizing the fields."

    In the waiting room of the Ningxiang bus station, I saw a short-haired girl wearing blue cloth clothes. My companion pointed out that she was Liu Shaoqi's niece, Liu Weikong. Last year, after graduating from Beijing Experimental High School, following her uncle's instructions, she returned home to be a farmer. When she first arrived in the countryside, she was not used to it. When she went up the mountain to chop firewood, her hands were cut with bloody gashes by the cogon grass. When she carried a load, her shoulders hunched up, and the farmers laughed at her for having three heads. But she was determined and not afraid to shrink back. Now, she is used to everything. She has become one with the farmers, and she declares that even if she marries, she will not leave.

    Through the introduction of the Ningxiang County Party Committee, I arrived at Lijingpu. The township was holding an enlarged general branch meeting. Niu Yuxiang, the director of the County Party Committee's Organization Department who was sent down to the township, was giving a report. He was a Northerner who came south in 1949 and was one of the pioneers of the township's work. Before the land reform, he almost suffered an assassination by a local tyrant landlord on a small mountain road. He said, "That guy hid in the mountains and fired a shot right in front of my eyes. I quickly jumped into the ditch, took out my submachine gun, and waited for a while. There was no movement in the mountains. When I got up to leave, two more shots rang out from behind. Neither of them hit."

    In the past, many of the big landlords in Ningxiang had guns. Their houses were built like fortresses, with gun holes in the walls, and ponds and deep, wide moats surrounded the perimeter, like city walls.

    During the Liberation War, in the Second Field Army's first attack on Kaifeng, Comrade Niu Yuxiang was a district cadre leading a stretcher team. In eight years of work, he was promoted to the prefectural committee, and this time he was sent back down to the township where he originally worked.

    Liu Junqiang, the deputy secretary of the Lijingpu Township General Branch, told me, "Minister Niu is really willing to work hard, getting covered in yellow mud during production."

    Comrade Liu Junqiang came from a hired farmhand background and begged for rice during famine years. In the old society, he only studied the old books for a year. After liberation, with the Party's training, his educational level improved. He can read documents, newspapers, novels, and write summaries. At night, after the meeting, he lit the kerosene lamp and hunched over his desk, preparing the draft of his report for tomorrow's meeting.

      "Look, isn't the agricultural university living well?" Comrade Niu Yuxiang looked at Comrade Liu Junqiang, who was working hard on his article, and smiled at me triumphantly.

    The slogan of the cadres in Lijingpu Township, like the slogan put forward in the old liberated areas, is: "Intellectualization of workers and peasants, worker-peasant intellectualization."

    In the middle of the enlarged general branch meeting, there was a family planning meeting. A female comrade from the Ningxiang County Women's Federation gave a brief report. Then, a doctor from the county health clinic explained the techniques of contraception and said: men who have vasectomies are still physiologically normal. Yuan Shaokui, a cadre from the supply and marketing cooperative, reported his experience with vasectomies, saying, "Everyone, don't be afraid. You get a numbing injection, and it doesn't hurt at all." At the end of the meeting, Comrade Liu Junqiang said a few words as a summary:

    "There are already thirty or so young men in our township who have had vasectomies. With advanced elements, things are easier to handle. Many families, because their lives have improved, want a daughter after having several sons, or want a son after having several daughters, and they just keep having them. We must control this. Don't listen to the rumors of bad people, saying that this is castration. This is not castration. After a vasectomy, you can rest for a week and still go to work as usual. It doesn't hinder the happiness of both people. If you want to get it done, it's best for the two of you to discuss it, but if the other party doesn't agree, it doesn't matter; the two of you aren't sharing the same pair of pants. Okay, this meeting is adjourned."

    After hearing these words, one person immediately signed up for surgery.

    I went to Tanjiashan Commune with technician Duan Guochang. Along the way, we talked non-stop. From his conversation, I knew that he was from Qiyang and that after graduating from Hunan Agricultural College, he was first assigned to Changde and soon transferred here. He wears a pair of 400-degree glasses; short hair across his forehead; an old tweed coat over a blue uniform. He believes that red clover is the best fertilizer, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and vitamins. It can be made into silage and used to feed cattle or pigs; more pigs fed, more fertilizer you get. The flowers of red clover are one of the best sources of nectar. The honey that is brewed from them is clear, bright, and sweet, and eating it can even prolong life. He is teaching commune members to raise bees and has written a bee-keeping song himself, asking someone to set it to music. Now, the children near his residence can already sing this new song. One line in the lyrics is: "To make rural life truly sweet as honey."

    Duan Guochang also said, "One mu of land can actually be used as six mu. Planting double-cropping rice is a double use, planting red clover is a triple use, and you can also plant rapeseed for oil." He also told me, "Now, one mu of red clover only yields about 4,000 catties, which is too low. One mu of land should and can yield more than 10,000 catties of red clover, and one season of rice should and can yield 1,500 catties per mu." Together with the cadres, this technician has set up an experimental field. He believes that the 10,000-catty and 1,500-catty targets can be achieved within a few years. He hopes not to be transferred for five years.

    The sky cleared, and the commune members, led by the township cadres and commune cadres, went out to work one after another. One commune cadre looked at the golden sunshine and happily said, "Spring struggles for the day, summer struggles for the hour, October's little spring. What great weather, men and women, young and old, can all go out to work."

    Tao, the secretary of Tanjiashan Commune, accompanied us to see the construction site of the pond, and then we visited commune member Zou Yicheng. The Zou family was poor before, but now, because both father and son work and the mother-in-law feeds pigs at home, they have become very wealthy. Last year, his family of seven had an average annual income of 128 yuan per person. The living standard of local wealthy middle peasants is an annual income of 80 yuan per person. Zou Yicheng has already exceeded this level. He has built a new house, bought new quilts, new bed sheets, new curtains, and even a red-lacquered carved Ningbo bed. The mother-in-law made a绒绳子 (rong sheng zi) upper garment. He has saved one hundred yuan in the commune; this year he sold a large pig to the state, and there is still a large, fat pig weighing more than 300 catties in the pen, ready to be slaughtered for the old year, solving the problem of cooking oil for the whole year. They never use staple food to feed the pigs. The pigs are well-fed and gain weight quickly, and they don't bark. The mother-in-law said with a smile, "We haven't raised any barking pigs." Pigs that bark are either sick or hungry.

    In order to prevent capitalist tendencies, Tanjiashan Commune is preparing to expand the accumulation of public funds. This commune already has a not-small amount of public funds. Secretary Tao said, "In three years, our commune will buy trucks. The highway that has reached the township government's gate will be built to the gate of the agricultural cooperative this year."

    I think that if our First Automobile Factory does not increase production, in three to five years, it will not be able to meet the needs of the vast rural market.

    宁乡闻见
    周立波
    车到宁乡，正细雨蒙蒙，远山呈现灰黯的轮廓。路上尽黄泥。路边的板田都耕转来了。红花草长得顶好。一座小屋的粉墙上，有条墨写的标语：“猪粪红花草，肥田两样宝。”
    在宁乡汽车站的候车室，看见一位身穿蓝布衣服的短发的姑娘。我的同伴指点说，她是刘少奇同志的侄孙女儿刘维孔。去年，她在北京实验中学毕业以后，依照她的叔公的指示，回家做农民。初到乡下时，她不大习惯，上山砍柴禾，手被丝茅勒出一条一条血口子。挑担子时，肩头压得耸起来，农民笑她是三只脑壳。但她决心大，不畏缩，现在，一切习惯了，她和农民打成了一片，并且宣称，就是出嫁，也不出去了。
    经过宁乡县委的介绍，到了历经铺。乡上在开总支扩大会。下放到乡的县委组织部长牛玉祥同志正在作报告。他是1949年南下的北方人，是这乡的工作的开辟者之一，土改前，在一条山边小路上，几乎遭受了一个恶霸地主的暗杀。他说：“那家伙躲在山里，一枪打在我的眼面前，我连忙跳进堤沟里，掏出快慢机，等了一会，山里没动静，我起身走，背后又响了两枪。都没有打中。”
    过去，宁乡的大地主好多都有枪。他们的房子修得像堡垒一样，墙上有枪眼，池塘和又深又宽的水濠围绕着四周，像护城河一样。
    解放战争中，二野头次打开封，牛玉祥同志是位带领抬架队的区干部。八年工作中，他被提升到地委，这回又下放到他原先工作的乡里来了。
    历经铺乡的总支副书记刘俊强同志告诉我说：“牛部长可舍得干哪，生产起来，溅得一身黄泥巴。”
    刘俊强同志长工出身，荒年讨过米。在旧社会，他只读得一年老书。解放后，在党的培养下，文化程度提高了，他能读文件，看报纸，念小说，写总结。晚上，开完了会，点起煤油灯，他伏在案上，准备明天会上报告的稿子。
      “你看这农业大学住得好吧？”牛玉祥同志看着刘俊强同志正在用心做文章，得意地对我笑笑说。
    历经铺乡的干部们的口号，跟从前老解放区提出的口号一样，是：“知识分子工农化，工农知识分子化。”
    在总支扩大会议的中间，夹了一个避孕会议。宁乡县妇联的女同志作了一个简短的报告。接着，县卫生所的医生讲解了避孕的技术，并且说：男人扎了输精管，生理正常。供销社干部袁绍葵同志报告了结扎输精管的经验，他说：“大家都不要害怕，打了麻药针，一点也不痛。”会议末尾，刘俊强同志说了几句话，算是总结：
    “我们乡已经有三十几个青壮年扎了输精管。有了先进分子，事情就好办。许多人家，因为生活上升了，生了几个儿子，还想个女儿，生了几个女儿，还要个儿子，生得没个完。这事情我们一定要控制。不要听坏人的造谣，说这是阉。这不是阉，扎了输精管，休养一星期，还是一样能出工，对两人幸福，也没有妨碍。要扎，顶好两个人商量一下，但是另外一方不赞成，也不要紧；还是可以扎，两公婆又不是共裤连裆。好吧，这个会就开到这里。”
    听了这话，当场就有一个人报名动手术。
    跟技术员段国昌一起，到谭佳山社去。一路上，我们不停地谈讲，从他谈话里，我晓得他是祁阳人，在湖南农学院毕业以后，起初分配到常德，不久调到了这里。他戴一副四百度的近视眼镜子；短发复额；蓝制服外，套件旧呢衣。他认为红花草是一种最好的肥料，里边含着氮、磷、钾，还有维生素。它可以做成青贮饲料，喂牛或喂猪；猪喂多了，可多得肥料。红花草的花是顶好的蜜源的一种，酿出来的蜜，又清又亮又香甜，吃了还长寿。他正在教社员养蜂，自己作了一只养蜂歌，要人谱了。现在，他的住处的附近的少年儿童们已经能唱这只新歌了。歌词里头有一句：“要使农村的生活，真正甜如蜜。”
    段国昌又说：“一亩田，其实可作六亩用，插双季稻，是两用，种红花草，是三用，还能种油菜榨油。”他又告诉我：“现在一亩红花草，只收四千来斤，产量太低了。一亩田应该而且可能收割红花草一万斤以上，一季稻一亩应该而且可能收获一千五百斤。”和干部们一起，这位技术员搞了一块试验田。他相信几年以内就能达到一万斤跟一千五的指标。他希望五年以内不调动工作。
    天晴了，社员们在乡干和社干的带动之下，纷纷出工。有位社干看了这个黄灿灿的太阳天，高兴地说：“春争日，夏争时，十月小阳春。真好天气呀，男女大小都能够出工。”
    谭佳山社的陶秘书陪同我们看了修塘的工地，又去拜访了社员邹义成。邹家原先穷，现在，因为父子两人都劳动，婆婆又在家喂猪，变得很富裕；去年，他一家七口，平均每人每年收入为一百二十八元，当地富裕中农的生活水平，每人每年收入为八十元。邹义成已经超过这个水平了。他盖起了新屋，置了新被窝，新床单，新帐子，还买了一张红漆雕花宁波床。婆婆打了一件绒绳子上衣。他在社里存了一百元；今年卖给国家一只大猪，栏里还关了一只三百多斤的大肥猪，准备过旧年杀了，解决全年食油的问题。他们喂猪从不用主粮，猪喂得好，长膘很快，而且不叫，婆婆笑着说：“我们没有喂过叫的猪。”爱叫的猪不是有病，就是肚子饿。
    为了防止资本主义的倾向，谭佳山社准备扩大公积金的积累。这个社已经有了一笔为数不小的公积金。陶秘书说：“三年以后，我们社里就要买卡车，已经达到乡政府门口的公路，今年要修到农业社门口。”
    我想，我们的第一汽车厂如果不加油生产，三五年后，就会不能满足广阔的农村市场的需要了。
