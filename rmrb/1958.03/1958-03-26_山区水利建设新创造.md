    New Creations in Mountainous Area Water Conservancy Construction
    Iron Pipe Bridge
    In carrying out water conservancy construction in mountainous areas, Diaohuang Township, Changzi County, Taiyue Mountain area, created a light and durable iron pipe bridge. This iron pipe bridge is made of ordinary waterwheel tube iron sheet, made into arc-shaped water troughs, connected section by section, and then wooden frames are erected to support it at the bottom of the gully, drawing a stream of spring water from Gushan (Fajiu Mountain) across a mountain gully more than ten feet wide to irrigate more than two hundred mu of terraced fields on the opposite hillside.
    The iron pipe bridge is very economical, costing only more than 400 yuan for more than ten feet, and it is light, durable, and can be dismantled and stored in winter to extend its service life.
    The Bajiao Liuli Well spring water in Fajiu Mountain has a high terrain and a small flow, and it is separated by a deep gully, so it used to flow into the mountain gully in vain. Some people suggested building a reservoir downstream to irrigate the land, but it would take up a lot of land, cost a lot, and delay work. Last winter, cadre Guo Ermao, who was sent to the countryside, and the peasants studied the iron pipe bridge method together. At the same time, the Bajiao Liuli well shaft was built higher and the spring was dug larger, so that the flow was doubled, and more than 20 mu of wasteland was freed up downstream, saving more than 1,500 man-days of labor.
    Dry Well Groups and Mountain-circling Canals
    The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Weijiazhuang, Lu'an County, Taihang Mountain area, has drilled many dry well groups in terraced fields without underground water sources, so that all 9,800 mu of terraced fields in the cooperative can "have wells wherever there is land."
    Dry well groups are determined according to different terrains. In terraced fields with sufficient water sources, large plots, and good soil quality, plum-shaped dry well groups are drilled, with 50 to 100 wells in each group. The wells are connected by underground tunnels, and a water lifting tool is installed on the most central well for irrigation; in narrow and long step-terraced fields, rows of self-flowing dry well groups are drilled. The bottom of each well is built with bricks into a square outlet, and wooden plugs are installed. When water is needed, the wooden plugs are pulled out and the water flows into the terraced fields; in scattered plots and terraced fields lacking water sources, star-shaped well groups are drilled. The members of the Wuyi Cooperative have drilled more than 1,400 various dry wells and built 40 mountain-circling water diversion canals, which are connected to the dry wells. It is achieved that "every well stores water, and every well is not empty."
    Underground Reservoir
    Sixty-five agricultural cooperatives along the Mumahu River in Xin County are jointly building an underground reservoir in order to draw water from under the sand layer. They are cutting across the riverbed upstream and building an underground dam downstream. To build this dam, a deep ditch must be opened in the sand and soil layer of the riverbed, and then a large dam 15 meters high, 342 meters long, and 79 meters wide on the dam surface is made of clay on the clay layer to cut off the water flow infiltrating into the pebble and sand layer. At the same time, underground water pipes are installed next to the dam to guide the infiltrated water flow to the crisscrossing canals along the river. When this underground reservoir is completed before the flood season, it will not only irrigate 160,000 mu of arid land along the river, but also gradually change the original desolate appearance of more than 60,000 mu of alkaline land.
    Magnetic Pipe Canal
    With the spirit of common research and bold creation, the members of Yanfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xin County used water diversion canals connected by magnetic pipes to introduce a stream of spring water that only stores one bucket of water every ten seconds from a mountain gully five miles away from the village, across the 17-foot-wide stone and sand river, two mountains, and four gullies into the village. This not only solved the difficulty of drinking water for the farmers in the village, but also irrigated 300 mu of terraced fields.
    Someone once suggested that there is a section of sandy soil river channel on this water diversion channel, and if an ordinary earth canal is built, all the water will be lost due to seepage. The old farmers suggested using porcelain clay pipes connected into a canal to divert water across the river. The members first built a water filter dam at the outlet to control the rapid flow of spring water and sediment. In order to protect the magnetic pipes from being washed away by floods, an underground earth dam was built at the bottom of the river, and the magnetic pipes were placed inside the dam. This also prevents the magnetic pipes from cracking due to cold. When passing through rocky cliffs and deep gullies, the members dug holes in the mountains and built bridges over the gullies, so that the 800-foot-long magnetic pipe canal extended to the village and farmland. The entire project only cost more than 2,300 yuan and saved a lot of manpower.

    山区水利建设新创造
    铁管桥
    太岳山区长子县刁黄乡在开展山区水利建设中，创造了一种轻便耐用的铁管桥。这种铁管桥是用普通水车筒铁皮，制成弧形水槽，一节一节的接起来，然后在沟底下立木架支撑，把孤山（法久山）的一股泉水引过十多丈宽的山沟，浇了对面山坡上二百多亩梯田。
    铁管桥很省钱，十多丈长只花了四百多元，而且轻便耐用，冬季还可拆卸保管，延长使用期。
    法久山八角琉璃井泉水，地势高，流量小，又隔着一条深沟，过去都白白流到山沟。有人建议在下游修水库浇地，但占地多，花费大，误工误时。去年冬季，下放干部郭二毛和农民一起研究铁管桥办法，同时，把八角琉璃井筒砌高，泉眼挖大，使流量扩大一倍，并且还腾出下游二十多亩荒地、节省一千五百多人工。
    旱井群和盘山渠
    太行山区的潞安县魏家庄五一农业社，在没有地下水源的梯田里打了许多旱井群，使全社九千八百多亩梯田作到“有地就有井”。
    旱井群是按不同地形决定的。在水源充足，地块大、土质好的梯田里，打梅花形状的旱井群，每群五十至一百眼，各井之间以暗洞连通，选择最中间的一眼井上安装提水工具进行灌溉；在窄长的台阶梯田里打排排自流旱井群，井底都用砖砌成一个方形出水口，并安置木塞，用水时拔木塞水就自流入梯田里了；在零星地块、水源缺乏的梯田，打星状井群。五一社的社员们共打了各类旱井一千四百多眼，修筑了四十条盘山引水渠，与旱井相连。做到“井井蓄水，个个不空”。
    地下水库
    忻县牧马河沿岸六十五个农业社，为了引取砂层底下的水源，正在联合修建一处地下水库。他们在上游横切河床，在下游修筑一个地下坝。修筑这个坝，要在河床砂土层中辟开一条深沟，然后在胶泥层土上用粘土做成一个高十五公尺，长三百四十二公尺，坝面宽七十九公尺的大坝，以截断潜入卵石砂层的水流，同时再从坝旁安装地下水管，导引潜流水量，通向沿岸纵横交错的水渠。这个地下水库在汛期以前完成后，不仅可使沿岸十六万亩干旱的土地得到灌溉，使六万多亩碱化土地也会逐渐改变原来荒凉面貌。
    磁管渠道
    忻县岩峰农业社的社员们以共同研究大胆创造的精神，利用磁管接成的引水渠道，把每十秒钟仅蓄一桶水的一股泉水，从远离村庄五里外的山沟里，横过十七丈宽的石砂河、两座山、四条沟引入村里，不仅解决了全村农民吃水的困难，还使三百亩梯田得到灌溉。
    曾有人提出过在这条引水道上，有一段沙土河道，如果修一般土渠就会把水全部渗漏。老农民建议用缸磁管接成渠道，引水过河。社员们先在出水口筑一滤水坝，控制泉水急流和泥沙。为了保护磁管不被洪水冲刷，在河底筑了一个地下土坝，把磁管放在坝内，这样还防止了磁管遇冷破裂现象。在通过石崖和深沟的时候，社员们遇山凿洞，逢沟架桥，使八百多丈长的磁管渠道，一直伸展到村庄和农田里。全部工程只投资二千三百多元，并且节省了大量的人工。
