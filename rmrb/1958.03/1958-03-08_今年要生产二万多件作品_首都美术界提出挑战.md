Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Two hundred and forty-four artists in the capital held meetings from March 3rd to 6th, proposing a great leap forward plan to produce 20,351 new works in 1958, challenging artists across the country. These artists include cartoonists, painters, traditional Chinese painters, sculptors, and printmakers. Their production targets for 1958 are as follows: 4,800 cartoons, 6,060 paintings, 5,812 traditional Chinese paintings, 1,567 sculptures, and 2,112 various prints.

Yu Feian, a traditional Chinese painter who is seventy years old, proposed to create 72 traditional Chinese paintings ranging from two to thirty square feet in 1958, averaging six paintings per month. The veteran painter Chen Banding originally planned to create 100 paintings this year, but now proposes to increase it by 50 paintings and 20 calligraphy works. In addition to creating and copying 20,000 characters of calligraphy and writing an ancient guqin piece this year, the traditional Chinese painter Fu Xuezai also plans to create 80 traditional Chinese paintings. Printmaker Li Hua wants to create 160 works. Cartoonist Hua Junwu created 60 cartoons last year and plans to create 300 this year. Painter Shao Yu plans to create 300 watercolor sketches this year. Ye Qianyu plans to create over 100 paintings of various kinds and prepare for a solo exhibition of his works planned for 1959. In the past, these people often did not have time to create because they were "holding multiple positions" and were often "busy with meetings." This time, they all expressed their determination to "squeeze" time to ensure the completion of their creative plans. Folk artists Zhang Jinghu ("Clay Figure Zhang") and Yang Shihui plan to sculpt 112 clay figures and 31 ivory carvings in 1958. Sculptor Liu Kaiqu also plans to create 12 sculptures this year. Many young sculptors have set an average plan of 30 sculptures per year.

The great leap forward plans of the capital's art community all regard reflecting the face of socialist construction, implementing the literary and artistic policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strengthening the guidance of mass art activities as important content.

Most of the artists who participated in the formulation of the plan have visited factories, rural areas, or border regions in recent years to observe production and familiarize themselves with life. In order to ensure the completion of the 1958 creative plan, many of them are preparing to further strengthen their ties with the workers and peasants.

    今年要生产二万多件作品
    首都美术界提出挑战
    据新华社6日讯　首都二百四十四位美术工作者从3日到6日分别开会，提出1958年要生产二万零三百五十一件新作品的跃进计划，向全国美术工作者挑战。这些美术工作者中有漫画家、绘画家、国画家、雕塑家和版画家。他们1958年的生产指标分别是：四千八百幅漫画、六千零六十幅绘画、五千八百一十二幅国画、一千五百六十七件雕塑品和二千一百一十二幅各种版画。
    年满七十的国画家于非暗提出1958年要创作二方尺到三十方尺的国画七十二幅，平均每月创作六幅。老画家陈半丁原计划今年创作一百幅画，现在又提出要增加五十幅画和二十件书法。国画家傅雪斋今年除了要创作和临摹书法二万字和写一个古琴曲子外，还准备创作国画八十幅。版画家李桦要创作一百六十幅。漫画家华君武去年创作了六十幅漫画，今年计划创作三百幅。绘画家邵宇准备今年创作水彩速写三百幅。叶浅予计划创作各种绘画百幅以上，并为拟在1959年举行的个人作品展览作准备。这些人过去都因为“身兼数职”，常常因为“开会忙”没有时间创作，这次都表示有决心“挤”时间保证完成创作计划。民间艺人张景祜（“泥人张”）、杨士惠计划1958年塑泥人一百一十二个和牙雕三十一件。雕塑家刘开渠今年也计划创作雕塑品十二件。许多青年雕塑工作者平均都订下了每年三十个塑像的计划。
    首都美术界的跃进计划中都把反映社会主义建设面貌、贯彻为工农兵服务的文艺方针和加强群众美术活动的辅导工作作为重要内容。
    参加制订计划的美术工作者几年来多半到过工厂、农村或边疆地区参观生产、熟悉生活。为了保证1958年创作计划的完成，他们中许多人都准备进一步加强和工农群众的联系。
