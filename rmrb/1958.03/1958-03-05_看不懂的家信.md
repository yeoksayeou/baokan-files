An Unreadable Letter From Home
Zhuang Nationality, Bai Wei

Just as I was about to get off work, I received a letter. Looking at the envelope, I knew it was from home. But when I opened it, the crookedly written characters, not quite English, not quite Russian, were incomprehensible. I couldn't read it, couldn't understand it. After examining it for a long time, I realized it was written in the Zhuang language. Who at home was deliberately teasing me, knowing that I hadn't learned the Zhuang script? I went to high school, but I've become illiterate when it comes to my own ethnic language!

After dinner, I rushed to find Lao Yao, who had recently returned from studying at a Zhuang language school, and asked him to translate it for me. The content was as follows:

    Younger Brother:
        I have good news for you: I was elected
    as a People's Representative and am now
    attending a meeting in the county. In a few
    days, I will go to the provincial capital to
    participate in the establishment ceremony of the
    Autonomous Region. This is a great happy
    event for us Zhuang people!
        ... In the past, you often wrote to advise me
    to attend a people's school, but I always thought
    I was nearly forty years old, what use was
    learning culture? Last year, the village
    launched a Zhuang language literacy campaign. The
    teacher came to my house several times to
    mobilize me, saying that in the past
    we didn't have our own writing system, and our
    culture was backward. Now, Chairman Mao has created
    a writing system for us to improve our
    ethnic culture, so that
    we can catch up with advanced ethnic groups and jointly
    build a socialist motherland. I finally
    happily enrolled in school. Now, I
    can write to you in my own ethnic language! ...

While Lao Yao was translating, my face was burning hot, and my heart was pounding. Looking at the letter, I still couldn't recognize a single character, but I felt very close to it. This was the first letter written by my elder brother's hands, which have held a hoe for decades! It was as if my elder brother was sitting right in front of me; I seemed to see his joyful smile and hear his slow and hearty voice.

My elder brother is a production expert. The Shangang Production Team he leads has achieved bumper harvests of corn year after year due to the implementation of technical reforms, and the sideline occupations are also doing very well. It is a model production team in the commune. Now he has become a People's Representative and has also turned over a new leaf culturally. What an extraordinary thing this is! However, I also feel a lot of shame. I don't even understand the writing of my own ethnic group. How can this be!

When I calmed down a bit, I picked up a pen to write a reply to him. But after writing only a few sentences, I stopped. How could my elder brother read this letter? Wouldn't he become illiterate to these Chinese characters? I should write in the language of our ethnic group that he already understands! But I haven't learned it yet. What to do? Should I ask Lao Yao to translate again? It's late, and he's probably already asleep. I thought of my two nephews who are studying Chinese in middle school and are now at home for winter vacation. If they're not there, I can also ask others in the village to read it. It's not like there isn't a single person who knows Chinese in the village anymore. With this thought, I added this final paragraph to the end of the letter:

        Elder Brother! To be honest with you, I
    haven't learned the language of our own ethnic group yet! Your
    letter was translated for me by a comrade in the office
    who recently returned from studying at a Zhuang language school.
    Please forgive me for still using Chinese to write this
    reply. If you can't understand it, you can ask someone to help
    you read it. The Zhuang cadres in our office
    will soon begin to learn the Zhuang language, and I will definitely
    study hard and catch up!

    看不懂的家信
    僮族　白苇
    刚要下班的时候，收到了一封信。看看信封，我知道是家里写来的。但拆开一看，里面歪歪斜斜写的字，英文不像英文，俄文不像俄文，看不懂，读不通，端详了好久，才知道是用僮文写的。这是家乡什么人故意写来捉弄我的呵，他大约知道我还未学僮文。我读过高中，但对这本民族的文字，却变成了睁眼瞎了！
    吃完晚饭，我赶去找新近从僮文学校学习回来的老姚，请他给我翻译。内文是这样：
    弟弟：
        告诉你一件喜事：我当选
    为人民代表，现在正在县里开
    会，过几天就要到省城去参加
    自治区成立典礼。这是我们僮
    族人民的大喜事啊！
        ……过去你常写信来劝我
    上民校，我总以为自己已是近
    四十岁的人了，学文化有什么
    用呢？去年屯里开展僮文扫盲，
    教师几次到家里动员，说过去
    我们没有自己的文字，文化落
    后；现在毛主席给我们创造了
    文字，要提高我们民族文化，使
    我们能赶上先进的民族，共同
    建设社会主义的祖国。我终于
    高兴地报名入学了。现在，我
    可以用自己民族的文字写信给
    你了哩。……
    在老姚翻译的时候，我脸上一直热烘烘的，心在卜卜地跳着。我看着信，字虽然还是一个不识，但我感觉很亲切。这是大哥拿锄头几十年的手第一次写来的呵！大哥好像就坐在我的面前，我仿佛看到他那乐滋滋的笑貌，听到他那低缓而爽朗的声音。
    大哥是个生产能手，他所领导的那个山岗生产队，由于推行技术改革，玉米连年获得丰产，副业也搞得很好，是社里的模范生产队；现在又当上了人民代表，又在文化上翻了身，这是一件多么不平常的事呵！然而，我又感到太多的惭愧，我连本民族的文字还不懂，这像什么话呢！
    等我心情平静了些，我执起笔来，马上给他写复信。可是，才写了几句，我停住了笔。这封信大哥怎么能看呢？对这些汉字，他又不是变成了睁眼瞎子？应该用他已经懂得的我们民族的文字写！可我还没有学。怎么办呢？再去找老姚翻译吗？时间不早，他恐怕已经睡了。我想到两个侄儿读中学，读的是汉文，现在放寒假正在家里；如果他们不在，也可以找屯里其他人看，屯里已不是找不到一个识汉字的人的时候了。这样一想，我便在信末补充这末一段：
        大哥！老实告诉你，我还
    未学懂本民族的文字哩！你的
    信是请机关里新近从僮文学校
    学习回来的同志给我翻译的。
    请你原谅我还是用汉文写这封
    回信。你看不懂，可以找人帮
    看。我们机关里的僮族干部不
    久就要开始学僮文了，我一定
    好好学习，迎头赶上！
