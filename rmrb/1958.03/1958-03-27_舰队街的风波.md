A Look at the “Free World”

	The Fleet Street Tempest
	An Old Reporter Speaks Out
	In the 1957 yearbook titled "Choosing a Career," published by the British "National Union of Students," an article by a veteran journalist from London's Fleet Street (the center of bourgeois newspapers) was published as a special feature. In this article, the reporter tells a small story based on personal experience, introducing the life and work of a newspaper reporter:

	One afternoon, a car pulled up in front of the coroner's office. An old reporter and a cub reporter were sitting in the car, talking. "Perhaps this afternoon we'll see a noble lady from a prominent family come to the coroner's office to pay her respects to her dead lover's remains..."

	The old reporter patiently answered the cub reporter's questions: "In modern society, how does one become a famous reporter?" He told the cub reporter that a famous reporter must be quick-witted, able to find a topic in ten seconds, and draft an outline of the story in twenty seconds—often in a stuffy telephone booth. A famous reporter must abandon human dignity without hesitation; he must have the cunning to defeat competitors. The old reporter said: "A noble lady mourning her dead lover at the coroner's office. This is basic material; it can be in the newspapers tomorrow."

	The cub reporter asked what activities a reporter should have in a week. The old reporter replied:

	"On the first day, you might go to the site of a plane crash and count the number of charred bodies. On the second day, report the highest noon temperatures at seventy seaside resorts in Britain. On the third day, find an adopter for a lost field mouse. On the fourth day, do nothing. On the fifth day, visit a pastor who has committed adultery. On the sixth day, drive two hundred miles to visit an atomic scientist who is away on business. On the seventh day, attend a press conference on the salary issues of postal workers... If you can earn two thousand pounds a year by middle age, that's not bad. If you can't, then get out!"

	A Small Story Causes a Tempest
	After the "Choosing a Career" yearbook was published, it caused a great uproar in London's Fleet Street. This small story exposed the true face of bourgeois journalists and offended the dignity of gentlemen and ladies. The British "Guild of Editors" raised objections to the "National Union of Students." The British "Press Council" declared that it had received a flood of appeals from Fleet Street.

	The Fleet Street bigwigs were furious, making the leaders of the "National Union of Students" very nervous. The union's chairman, Freeman, quickly issued a statement saying that he had not seen this article before it went to print. He announced the immediate cessation of free distribution and sales of the "Choosing a Career" yearbook and the recall of the remaining copies. However, as of the end of January, the 20,000 copies of the yearbook that had been distributed for free had already been sent out, and the total print run was only 21,000 copies. Only the unsold portion of the 1,000 copies sold in bookstores could possibly be recovered.

	An Image That Cannot Be Erased
	Freeman reached an agreement with the "Guild of Editors" that the association would commission an editor to write an article to erase the impression created by the small story. Thus, not long ago, another publication of the "National Union of Students," "National Union of Students News," published an article by a doctor: "Detailed Discussion of the Problem of University Graduates Choosing Journalism as a Career." Freeman stated that when the "Choosing a Career" yearbook is republished at the end of 1958, it will reprint the aforementioned doctor's work or commission experts to write an article of the same nature. Amidst a flurry of apologies and guarantees, the Fleet Street tempest gradually subsided. However, the image of bourgeois journalists exposed by the small story is one that no one can erase.

    舰队街的风波
    老记者现身说法
    在英国“全国学生联盟”出版的题名为“择业”的1957年年刊中，刊载了伦敦舰队街（资产阶级报刊集中区）的一位老牌记者写的特约稿。在这篇文章里，这位记者现身说法地讲了一个小故事，介绍新闻记者的生活与工作：
    一天下午，验尸所的门前停着一辆小汽车。前来采访的一位老记者与一名见习记者正坐在汽车里谈话。“也许就在这个下午会碰上一个名门望族的贵妇到验尸所里来瞻仰她那死去的情人的遗容……”。
    老记者不厌其详地答复见习记者提出的问题：“在现代的社会里，怎样做一个名记者？”他告诉见习记者说，一个名记者必须思想敏捷，能够在十秒钟以内发现题材，在二十秒钟以内——往往在闷热的电话间里——把故事梗概编好。一个名记者必须毫无顾忌地抛弃人的尊严，他必须有打倒竞争者的机智。老记者说：“贵妇在验尸所悼念死去的情人。这是一种基本的材料，明天就可以见报。”
    见习记者问，一个记者在一周内应该有些什么活动。老记者回答说：
    “第一天不妨到飞机失事的所在地去数一下被烧焦了的尸体有多少具。第二天报道英国七十处海滨避暑地中午的最高温度。第三天为一只迷途的大田鼠征求一位收养者。第四天一事不作。第五天去访问一位犯了通奸罪的牧师。第六天乘汽车疾驰两百哩去拜访一位因事外出的原子科学家。第七天参加有关邮局职工薪资问题的记者招待会……这样到了中年，如果你能挣到两千英镑一年，那就算不坏。如果挣不到，那么你就滚蛋吧！”
    小故事引起风波
    “择业”年刊出版以后，在伦敦舰队街里引起了轩然大波。这个小故事暴露了资产阶级新闻记者的真面目，冒犯了绅士淑女们的尊严。英国“报刊编者协会”向“全国学生联盟”提出了异议。英国“报业理事会”宣称该会收到了舰队街纷至沓来的申诉书。
    舰队街老爷们大发雷霆，使“全国学生联盟”的负责人十分紧张。该联盟主席弗里曼赶紧发表声明说，这篇文章付印以前并未经他过目。他宣布立即停止“择业”年刊的赠阅与发售，并收回剩余的册数。但是截至1月底为止，该项年刊赠阅的两万册早已送讫，而总印数只有两万一千册。可能收回的只有书店经售的一千册中尚未售完的部分。
    涂抹不掉的形象
    弗里曼与“报刊编者协会”达成了一项协议，由该协会委托一位编者撰写一篇文章来涂抹小故事所产生的印象。于是，不久以前，“全国学生联盟”的另一个刊物“全国学生联盟新闻”就发表了一位博士的文章：“详论大学毕业生选择新闻工作为职业的问题”。弗里曼声明1958年年底，“择业”年刊再度出版时，将转载上述博士的大作或委托专家撰写同样性质的文章。在一片道歉、保证声中，舰队街的风波逐渐地平息了。但是小故事所暴露的资产阶级新闻记者的形象，却是谁也涂抹不掉的。
