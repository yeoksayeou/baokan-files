Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 30th. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to organize leading cadres at the county level and above, as well as theoretical workers, to systematically study the new problems raised in the current rectification movement and the high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that doing so will more effectively improve practical work and promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production; and will enable responsible cadres to pay attention to adopting the method of studying Marxist-Leninist theory by focusing on practical issues of the Chinese revolution, and gradually improve their theoretical and professional levels.

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a notice stating that all party's leading cadres in the province with the conditions for conducting theoretical research and theoretical education workers with certain practical work experience should, as far as possible, adopt the method of special topic research, alone or in groups, and study at least one major issue related to current practical work each year, and write a special topic paper or report. The topic of the special study shall be determined by the cadres conducting the study based on their own business, expertise, and interests, but when considering the topic, they must proceed from the current situation, the party's work tasks, and their own level.

The Provincial Party Committee also stipulates that when conducting special topic research, sufficient practical materials should be collected, attention should be paid to reading relevant classical works and party documents; discussions and debates should be conducted with relevant comrades, and it should be combined with the experimental work carried out by the department. Write a report or article that is logically rigorous, clear in writing, theoretical, practical, situational, and analytical.

The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee has also formulated fifty research topics for leading cadres above the level of the Prefectural Committee Secretary to refer to when choosing topics. These topics are all important issues in the actual work and political movements at that time and place.

The Provincial Party Committee requires that cadres who conduct special topic research must submit their papers to the Provincial Party Committee before October. Those with better content will be published in newspapers and periodicals, or the authors will give speeches to cadres and intellectuals in the organs.

At present, many leading cadres of the Prefectural Committee and County Committee have submitted their special research topics and plans to the Provincial Party Committee.

    陕西组织负责干部和理论工作者
    研究整风和生产中新问题
    新华社西安30日电　中共陕西省委决定组织县级以上负责干部和理论工作者，比较系统地研究目前整风运动和工农业生产高潮中提出的新问题。
    省委认为，这样做会更有效地改进实际工作，促进工农业生产大跃进；并使负责干部注意采取以研究中国革命实际问题为中心的方法，深入学习马克思列宁主义理论，逐步地提高自己的理论水平和业务水平。
    中共陕西省委最近发出通知说，凡是具有进行理论研究工作条件的全省党的负责干部和具有一定实际工作经验的理论教育工作者，都要尽可能地采用专题研究的方法，单独或组成小组，每年至少研究一个有关当前实际工作的重大问题，写出专题论文或报告。专题研究的题目，由进行研究的干部根据本身业务、特长和兴趣自行确定，但在考虑题目时，一定要从当前形势、党的工作任务和自己的水平出发。
    省委还规定在进行专题研究时，要搜集充分的实际材料，要注意阅读有关的经典著作和党的文件；要和有关的同志研讨和辩论，要结合本部门所搞的试验工作。并写出逻辑严密，辞章鲜明，有理论，有实际，有情况，有分析的报告或文章。
    陕西省委还拟定了五十个研究题目，供地委书记以上负责干部在选题时作参考。这些选题都是当时当地实际工作和政治运动中的重要问题。
    省委要求凡作专题研究的干部，必须在10月份以前将论文送交省委。其中内容较好的将在报刊上刊登，或由作者向机关干部和知识分子作演讲。
    现在，已有不少地委、县委负责干部将他们的专题研究的题目和计划报到省委。
