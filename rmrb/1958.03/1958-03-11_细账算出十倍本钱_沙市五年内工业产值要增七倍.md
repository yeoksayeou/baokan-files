    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 10th. Shashi, Hubei Province, is using the method of meticulous accounting to tap the potential of funds from all aspects, developing local industry, and planning to increase the city's total industrial output by more than seven times in five years without any investment from higher authorities. It also strives to catch up with Wuhan's 1957 local industrial output by 1962.
    Shashi has a relatively weak local industrial base. When relevant departments were originally formulating the plan for the development of local industry from 1958 to 1962, they believed that the city would only have 5 million yuan of funds available for local industrial construction in the next three years, and a large part of the funds needed for the development of local industry would rely on investment from the leading departments of Hubei Province.
    The Shashi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China reversed this idea of relying on investment from higher authorities to develop local industry. It decided to direct the solution of funds towards meticulous accounting throughout the city and deeply tap the potential of all walks of life in the city. In accordance with this spirit, the city adopted a method of combining leadership with the masses, not only calculating the large accounts of industrial and commercial income accumulating funds, but also calculating all possible funds that could be accumulated from small handicrafts, small vendors, and idle funds. In this way, a large amount of funding potential was tapped, making it possible for Shashi's local industry to invest 58 million yuan in five years, an increase of more than tenfold compared to the original. This year, the city has raised 6.35 million yuan for the development of local industry. It is estimated that the city's industrial output value will increase by at least 50% this year compared to last year.

    细账算出十倍本钱
    沙市五年内工业产值要增七倍
    新华社武汉10日电　湖北省沙市用算细账的办法挖掘各方面的资金潜力，发展地方工业，计划在五年内不要上级投资一分钱，使全市的地方工业总产值增加七倍多；并争取到1962年，赶上武汉市1957年的地方工业总产值。
    沙市地方工业基础比较薄弱，有关部门原来在制定1958年至1962年发展地方工业规划时，认为今后三年全市只能有五百万元资金可以投入地方工业建设，发展地方工业所需要的很大一部分资金，要依靠湖北省领导部门投资解决。
    中共沙市市委扭转了这种依靠上级投资发展地方工业的思想，决定把解决资金的方向，引向在全市范围内算细账，深入挖掘本市各行各业的潜力。按照这一精神，全市采取领导同群众相结合的办法，不仅算了工业、商业收入积累资金的大账，并且把所有小手工业、小商小贩、闲散资金方面可能积累的资金，都计算了。这样一来挖掘出了大量资金潜力，使沙市地方工业五年内的投资数可能达到五千八百万元，比原来增加了十倍以上。今年全市已筹集了六百三十五万元资金，用于发展地方工业。估计全市的工业产值，今年最少可比去年增长50％。
