The sixth issue of "Literary Gazette," published on March 26th, features a record of a symposium on Comrade Zhou Yang's article "A Great Debate on the Literary and Art Front." Participants in the "Literary Gazette" symposium included a group of writers and critics from Beijing, including Zheng Zhenduo, Shao Quanlin, Ai Wu, Zang Kejia, Lin Mohan, Wang Yao, and twelve others. The symposium unanimously agreed that Comrade Zhou Yang's article was rich in content and of great educational significance to literary and art workers, pointing out a clear direction and excitingly bright prospects for future literary and art work. Comrade Zhou Yang, employing the fundamental principles of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," not only summarized the achievements of the anti-Rightist struggle in literary and art circles last year but also provided a basis for summarizing the long-standing differences and disputes in China's left-wing literary movement.

Everyone believed that the article clearly pointed out the historical and class roots of the Rightist elements' attacks against the Party in literary and art circles. The struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois literary lines in our country has a history of more than thirty years. The struggle led by Lu Xun's revolutionary literature against the "Crescent Moon Society," the "Third Person," and the "Nationalist Literature" faction was the first round of this struggle; later came the struggle against Feng Xuefeng, Hu Feng, and others hidden within the revolutionary literary camp; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, there was the struggle against Ding Ling, Xiao Jun, and Wang Shiwei, as well as the struggle against Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng in the Kuomintang-controlled areas; until last year's "Great Debate," it was still a continuation and development of the struggle between two roads, but this time it was a total reckoning. The removal of the shackles of bourgeois ideology has opened up a broad road for proletarian literature and art. A completely new type of literary and art contingent is being built, and the glorious prospects of socialist literature and art have been displayed before us.

Many comrades believed that one of the most profound lessons of this struggle is that literary and art workers must transform themselves. Everyone said that Comrade Zhou Yang's statement that "individualism is the source of all evils in socialist society" is a pointed warning. Resolutely and thoroughly discarding the burden of individualism and entrusting one's heart to the Party is the only path for literary and art workers today.

The comrades who participated in the symposium stated that Comrade Zhou Yang's article conducted a profound and forceful criticism of revisionist literary and art thought, exposing its mask and essence. The writers deeply felt the harm of revisionism, and only by removing these obstacles can our literary and art ranks unite on a new basis and can the socialist literary and art cause be developed and prospered.

    无产阶级文艺光芒万丈
    首都作家座谈文艺界反右派斗争成果
    本报讯　3月26日出版的第六期“文艺报”发表了关于周扬同志“文艺战线上的一场大辩论”一文的座谈记录。参加“文艺报”座谈会的是北京的一部分作家、评论家郑振铎、邵荃麟、艾芜、臧克家、林默涵、王瑶等十二人。座谈会一致认为周扬同志的文章内容丰富，对文艺工作者有很大的教育意义，对今后文艺工作指出了鲜明的方向和令人兴奋的光明远景。周扬同志运用毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的根本原则，不但总结了去年文艺界反右派斗争的成果，也对长期以来我国左翼文艺运动中的分歧和争论，提供了总结的基础。
    大家认为文章明确地指出了文艺界右派分子向党进攻的历史的和阶级的根源。我国文艺上的无产阶级和资产阶级两条文艺路线的斗争已有三十多年的历史。以鲁迅为首的革命文艺同“新月派”、“第三种人”、“民族主义文学”派的斗争，就是这一斗争的最初一个回合；后来是对冯雪峰、胡风等隐藏在革命文艺阵营内部的斗争；抗日战争时期是对丁玲、萧军、王实味的斗争，以及在国民党统治区对胡风、冯雪峰的斗争；直到去年的“大辩论”仍然是两条道路的斗争的继续和发展，但这一次是总的清算。资产阶级思想的镣铐的解除，为无产阶级文艺开辟了广阔的道路。一支完全新型的文艺队伍正在建成，社会主义文艺的光辉远景已经展示在面前。
    许多同志认为这次斗争的一个最深刻的教训就是文艺家必须改造自己，大家都说周扬同志所说的“个人主义，在社会主义社会，是万恶之源”是一针见血的警句。坚决彻底丢掉个人主义包袱，把心交给党，这是今天文艺家的唯一道路。
    参加座谈的同志表示，周扬同志的文章对于修正主义文艺思想进行了深刻有力的批判，揭穿了它的假面具和实质。作家们深深地感到修正主义的危害性，只有扫除了这些障碍，才能使我们的文艺队伍在新的基础上团结起来，使社会主义的文艺事业得到发展和繁荣。
