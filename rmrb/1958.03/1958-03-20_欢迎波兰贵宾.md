    Welcome Polish Guests of Honor
    Last spring, we welcomed the Polish government delegation headed by Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz with great pleasure. This spring, we once again welcome the Polish government delegation led by Polish Vice Premier Jaroszewicz with the same feeling. Prior to this, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai of our country had also visited Poland successively. The frequent mutual visits of leaders of our two countries mark the strengthening and development of the friendly relations between the two peoples. May the friendship between the peoples of our two countries be forever like spring, more prosperous, developed, and flourishing!
    The peoples of China and Poland have long had a profound friendship. Our two socialist countries, with Marxism-Leninism as the common ideological foundation and building socialism and communism as the common goal of struggle, have formed a brotherly relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation. In recent years, the political, economic, and cultural relations between China and Poland have been continuously developing and consolidating. The Polish people have always supported our country's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and defend world peace, and have provided fraternal assistance to our country's socialist construction. Poland supplies our country with steel, machine tools, transportation equipment, agricultural machinery, and chemical raw materials needed for the development of industry and agriculture, and also helps our country design factories, train workers and technicians, and provides great assistance to our country in ocean shipping. Trade between China and Poland is constantly expanding. From 1950 to 1956, the trade volume between China and Poland almost increased tenfold. The cultural cooperation agreement and scientific cooperation protocol signed by the governments of China and Poland ensure extensive cooperation between the two countries in culture and science. In recent years, China and Poland have continuously exchanged delegations in culture, art, science, education, and sports, further strengthening mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between the two peoples through cultural exchanges.
    When the Polish guests of honor come to visit our country, we are pleased to see that the Polish people are increasingly united around the Polish United Workers' Party, fighting to consolidate and develop the socialist cause, and have made significant achievements. In the thirteen years since liberation, Poland's economic construction has developed at an astonishing speed, transforming this backward country before the war into a new and advanced industrial-agricultural country. At present, the total industrial output value of Poland accounts for 79% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of Poland. Poland's total industrial output has ranked fifth in Europe, and its per capita calculation has caught up with France and greatly exceeded Italy. The rapid development of Poland's national economy has greatly improved the living standards of the Polish people. The average annual consumption of consumer goods per person in Poland has exceeded that of Italy. In the past year, the Polish Party and government have made significant efforts to improve the people's living welfare. At present, the Polish people are continuing to overcome some difficulties in socialist construction and are fighting to realize the new five-year plan, further develop Poland's national economy, and improve the people's living welfare.
    While carrying out peaceful construction, the Polish people, together with the peace-loving people of all countries, have made unremitting struggles to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace. The Polish people have always strived to establish a European collective security system. Poland actively participated in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina, making significant contributions to peace in Asia. Last December, the Polish government proposed the initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, which was supported by all socialist countries and praised by peace-loving people all over the world. This initiative has powerfully promoted the movement to eliminate the threat of atomic war and ease international tensions.
    Poland stands on the western edge of the socialist camp and has a very important position in defending the peace and security of the socialist camp. The Polish people have always strived to strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. For more than a year, through some friendly talks and the signing of friendly agreements, Poland's relations with all socialist countries have been constantly developing. The delegations of the Chinese and Polish parties both participated in the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held in Moscow last November. The declaration adopted by this meeting further strengthened the unity between socialist countries. The continuously strengthening unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is an important guarantee for the socialist cause and the cause of world peace in all countries.
    When we warmly welcome the Polish government delegation to visit our country, we also deeply thank the Polish people for their fraternal assistance to our country. We are willing to join hands with the Polish people to further strengthen the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Poland and the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and continue to fight side by side to further consolidate the cause of world peace.

    欢迎波兰贵宾
    去年春天，我们曾以愉快的心情欢迎了以波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰政府代表团。今年春天，我们又以同样的心情来欢迎由波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇率领的波兰政府代表团。在这以前，我国朱德副主席和周恩来总理也曾先后访问过波兰。我们两国领导人员的经常互相往来，标志着两国人民友好关系的加强和发展。愿我们两国人民之间的友谊永远像春天，更加繁荣、发展和茂盛！
    中波两国人民之间早就有着深厚的友谊。我们两个社会主义国家，以马克思列宁主义为共同的思想基础，以建设社会主义和共产主义为共同的奋斗目标，已经结成了兄弟般的互助合作的关系。几年来，中波两国的政治、经济和文化关系都在不断地发展和巩固。波兰人民一向支持我国维护国家主权和保卫世界和平的斗争，并对我国的社会主义建设事业提供了兄弟般的援助。波兰供给我国发展工农业所需的钢材、工作母机、运输设备、农业机器和化学原料等，并且帮助我国设计工厂、训练工人和技术人员，在远洋航运方面也给予我国很大的帮助。中波两国的贸易正在不断扩大。从1950年到1956年，中波两国贸易额差不多增加了十倍。中波两国政府签订的文化合作协定和科学合作议定书等，保证了两国在文化和科学方面的广泛合作。几年来，中波两国不断交换文化、艺术、科学、教育和体育等方面的代表团，通过文化交流更进一步加强两国人民之间的互相了解和友好合作。
    当波兰贵宾们前来访问我国的时候，我们高兴地看到，波兰人民正日益紧密地团结在波兰统一工人党的周围，为巩固和发展社会主义事业而斗争，并且已取得了重大的成就。在解放后的十三年中，波兰的经济建设以惊人的速度向前发展，已使这个战前的落后国家变为新的先进的工业—农业国。目前，波兰的工业总产值已占波兰工农业总产值的79％。波兰的工业总产量已居欧洲的第五位，按人口平均计算已赶上了法国，并且大大超过了意大利。波兰国民经济的迅速发展，已使波兰人民的生活水平有了很大的提高。波兰每人每年平均所得消费品的数量已经超过了意大利。在过去一年中，波兰党和政府为了提高人民生活福利作了重大的努力。目前，波兰人民正在继续克服社会主义建设中的一些困难，为实现新的五年计划，进一步发展波兰的国民经济和提高人民生活福利进行斗争。
    在进行和平建设的同时，波兰人民同爱好和平的各国人民一起，为缓和国际紧张局势、维护世界和平进行了不懈的斗争。波兰人民一向为建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力。波兰积极参加了朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际监督和监察委员会，对亚洲和平作出了重大的贡献。去年12月波兰政府提出了关于建立中欧地区无原子武器区的倡议，获得了全体社会主义国家的支持以及全世界爱好和平的各国人民的赞扬。这一倡议有力地推动了消除原子战争威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的运动。
    波兰屹立在社会主义阵营的西边，对捍卫社会主义阵营的和平安全具有十分重要的地位。波兰人民一向为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营而努力。一年多以来，通过一些友好的会谈和签订友好的协定，波兰同所有社会主义国家的关系正在不断地发展。中国和波兰的党的代表团，都参加了去年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议，这个会议所通过的宣言，进一步加强了社会主义国家之间的团结。以苏联为首的社会主义国家不断加强的团结，是各国社会主义事业和世界和平事业的重要保证。
    当我们热烈欢迎波兰政府代表团来我国访问的时候，我们也深深感谢波兰人民给予我国的兄弟般的援助。我们愿同波兰人民一起，为进一步加强中波两国人民的友好关系和以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，为进一步巩固世界和平事业而继续奋斗，携手并进。
