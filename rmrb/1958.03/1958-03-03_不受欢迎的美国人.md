    Unpopular Americans
    By Our Correspondent Su Lan

    Ruislip
    Ruislip is a small town in the suburbs of London. The town is known not because there is an American "Coca-Cola" factory here, but because it is the location of the U.S. Strategic Air Command.
    The Air Force Command is backed by the railway. On the other side of the railway is an airport. At first glance, this red brick building is not special. However, it is surrounded by a circle of barbed wire, and there are signs warning passing vehicles: "Slow! Military Area... Danger..." All of this gives the building a mysterious color.
    In fact, it is indeed a bit mysterious. In these houses, there are hundreds of American officers and staff, busy all day long, doing what? From here, there are direct telephone lines to Washington, New York and the North Atlantic Group Command in Paris. It commands the American Strategic Air Force stationed in Britain. On the narrow British Isles, American air bases occupy thirty-seven square miles of land, and thirty-six thousand American airmen are stationed. From these bases, bombers carrying hydrogen bombs take off, passing over London, Oxford, Coventry, Edinburgh... People even worry that if one of these thirty-six thousand Americans goes crazy like former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, a catastrophe will befall the British people out of thin air.

            Anxiety Turns into Anger
    The anxiety of the British people has turned into anger due to the entry into force of the U.S. agreement to establish missile bases in Britain. This sentiment is expressed in the open letter of sixty-nine Labor Party members of Parliament, in the results of the opinion polls conducted by British newspapers, and in the lines of voters in front of the Parliament demanding to meet with members of Parliament. It is even more prominently manifested in the fact that the Communist Party of Great Britain's movement against American missile bases is gaining wider and wider support.
    Protest signature books were distributed from the London "Daily Worker" and local organizations of the Communist Party, and batch after batch of signatures were collected, including one hundred and fifty trade union leaders in the London area. The signature book reads: "The British people must not be led to the slaughterhouse like sheep! The way to solve important international problems is not through hydrogen bombs and missiles, but through a summit meeting between East and West."
    The protests from all directions made the Conservative government even more anxious to cover up the true situation of the Anglo-American agreement. Just as the question of "who presses the button" was entangled in Parliament, an annoying thing happened.
    The memorandum published by the British government stated that the missiles would be managed and operated by the British. However, an American officer in Washington—Commander of the 672nd "Thor" Missile Squadron, Air Force Colonel Henry Sink, triumphantly declared: "American soldiers will strictly manage the first 'Thor' missile base in Britain." He also boasted that his squadron's mission was to carry out "retaliation" within fifteen minutes of an enemy attack. If the situation is urgent, "it can be launched within two minutes of receiving the order."
    Then, there was a public outcry, and British Defense Minister Sandys quickly came out to deny that the American colonel's words were "incorrect."

            "Move the Missiles Back to New York!"
    "Boo!" "Boo!" "Boo!" In the square in front of the U.S. Strategic Air Command in Ruislip, about six thousand people booed the drooping American Stars and Stripes three times.
    This was a protest by demonstrators against the U.S. Strategic Air Command. They demanded that the commander here meet with their delegation and convey the demand that "Yankees go home" to Eisenhower. However, the American commander here did not know where he had gone to spend this uneasy weekend.
    This is what happened on the afternoon of March 1. In London, Lancashire, South Wales, Scotland... large-scale demonstrations were held at the same time. This is the first climax of the British people's struggle against the establishment of American missile bases.
    The demonstration in Ruislip included a large number of workers, intellectuals and housewives from London, as well as representatives from Birmingham, Coventry, Southampton and East Anglia. They held up placards and flags with slogans such as: "We don't want missile bases here!" "Hold a summit meeting immediately!" When the procession passed in front of the Command headquarters, they shouted: "Yankees go home!" "We want peace!" At this time, the windows and doors of the American Command headquarters were closed and lifeless, and only British police were guarding the gate in two rows.
    After the procession passed in front of the Command headquarters, a mass meeting was held on the opposite square. General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Gollan, asked in front of the microphone: "Is the establishment of American missile bases in Britain for peace or for war?"
    A roar came from the crowd: "War!"
    Gollan asked: "Can the establishment of American missile bases in Britain promote peace?"
    The crowd roared: "No!"
    "Then let them set up missile bases in New York and Chicago!"
    Unpopular Americans, you should indeed consider: it's time for you to go home... (Attached picture)
    The people of London pasted the slogan "Close down the Yankee bases quickly" on the barbed wire of the U.S. Air Force Command.

    不受欢迎的美国人
    本报记者　苏蓝
    鲁斯里普
    鲁斯里普是伦敦郊区的一个小镇。这个小镇的有名，并非因为在这儿有个美国“可口可乐”工厂，而是因为它是美国战略空军司令部的所在地。
    空军司令部背靠着铁路。在铁路的那一边，就是个飞机场。初看起来，这个红砖砌成的建筑物，并没有什么特点。但是，在它周围布上了一圈铁丝网，铁丝网边还竖上了警告来往车辆的牌子；“慢！军机要地……危险……”。这一切，把这个建筑物披上了神秘的色彩。
    事实上，也的确有点神秘。在这些房子里，有几百名美国军官和参谋人员，他们整天忙忙碌碌地，在干些什么？从这儿，有电话直通华盛顿、纽约和巴黎的北大西洋集团司令部。它指挥着美国驻在英国的战略空军。在窄窄的英伦三岛上美国空军基地占有三十七平方英里的土地，驻扎着三万六千名美国空军。从这些基地上，飞起了载有氢弹的轰炸机，掠过伦敦、牛津、考文垂、爱丁堡……的上空。人们甚至担心：这三万六千个美国人中，如果有一个像美国前国防部长福莱斯特尔一样地发了疯，那末，一场大灾难就会平空地落在英国人的头上。
            不安变成愤怒
    英国人的不安，由于美国在英国建立导弹基地协定的生效，而变成了愤怒。这种情绪，表现在六十九名工党议员的公开信中，表现在英国报纸举办的民意测验的结果中，表现在议会门前要求议员接见的选民队伍中。它更突出地表现在英共组织的反对美国导弹基地的运动得到愈来愈广泛的支持这一事实上面。
    抗议的签名书从伦敦“工人日报”和英共的地方组织中分发出去，征得了一批又一批的签名，其中包括伦敦地区一百五十名工会领袖。签名书上写道：“英国人民决不能像羊一样被牵到屠场上去！解决国际重要问题的途径，不是通过氢弹和导弹，而是东西方首脑会议。”
    从四面八方传来的抗议声，使得保守党政府更急于掩饰英美协定的真实情况。正当“究竟谁按电钮”的问题在议会中纠缠不清的时候，一件使人恼火的事情发生了。
    英国政府公布的备忘录中说：导弹将由英国来管理和操纵。但是，华盛顿的一个美国军官——第六七二“雷神”导弹中队指挥官、空军上校亨利·辛克，得意洋洋地宣称：“美国士兵将严格管理第一个在英国的‘雷神’导弹基地。”他还吹嘘：他的中队的任务，是在敌人进攻的十五分钟内进行“报复”。假若情况紧急，“在接到命令的两分钟内就可以放射出去。”
    接着是，舆论大哗，英国国防大臣桑迪斯赶紧出来否认，说这位美国上校的话是“不正确的。”
            “把导弹搬回纽约去！”
    “嘘！”“嘘！”“嘘！”在鲁斯里普美国战略空军司令部前面的广场上，约六千人对着低垂的美国星条旗齐嘘三声。
    这是游行示威的群众对美国战略空军司令部的抗议。他们要求这里的指挥官接见他们的代表团，把“美国佬滚回去”的要求转达给艾森豪威尔。但是，这里的美国指挥官不知躲到何处去度过这个不平静的周末。
    这是3月1日下午发生的事情。在伦敦、兰开夏、南威尔士，苏格兰……都在同一个时间举行了大示威。这是英国人民反对美国建立导弹基地斗争的第一个高潮。
    在鲁斯里普的示威，包括从伦敦来的大批工人、知识分子和家庭妇女，从伯明翰、考文垂、南安普顿和东安格利地来的代表。他们举着标语牌和旗帜，上面写着；“我们这里不要导弹基地！”“立即举行首脑会谈”。当队伍经过司令部门前时，他们就高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”“我们要和平！”这时，美国司令部门窗紧闭、死气沉沉，只有英国警察分成两排守卫着大门。
    游行队伍通过司令部门前后，就在对面的广场上举行群众大会，英共总书记高兰在麦克风前问道：“美国在英国建立导弹基地，是为了和平还是为了战争？”
    从群众中传来了吼声：“战争！”
    高兰问：“美国在英国建立导弹基地，能不能促进和平？”
    群众的吼声是：“不能！”
    “那末让他们把导弹基地设到纽约和芝加哥去吧！”
    不受欢迎的美国佬，确实应该考虑一下：是你们回家的时候了……。（附图片）
    伦敦人民在美国空军司令部的铁丝网上贴上“赶快关闭美国佬的基地”的标语。
