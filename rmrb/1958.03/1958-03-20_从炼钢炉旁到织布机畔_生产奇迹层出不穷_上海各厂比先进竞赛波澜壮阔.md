Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 19th. Since the start of the all-round leap forward competition to compare who is more advanced and who can achieve more, faster, better, and more economically, good news has been pouring in from Shanghai's industrial front in the past few days. From steel furnaces to looms, from workshops to the ocean, from large factories with tens of thousands of workers to small factories with only a few people, miracles are appearing everywhere.

On the 13th, steelworkers created twenty-one new records in a row. Inspired by the slogan "Catch up with Qingdao," the superior-grade yarn produced by cotton mill workers sprung up like mushrooms after rain; two-thirds of the city's cotton mills have already produced superior-grade yarn. Employees of the Yangshupu Power Plant proposed: however much electricity Shanghai's industrial and agricultural production needs, that's how much electricity we will generate. They are tapping potential in many ways, striving to generate 300 million more kilowatt-hours this year.

More than 500 factories in the city have proposed that 1,035 brands of products should catch up with the quality levels of capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. In the recent short period of more than ten days, more than ten products have already achieved this goal ahead of schedule. A high-precision gear grinder successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant on the 12th grinds workpieces with a precision exceeding that of the gear grinder produced by the famous Orcutt factory in Britain. The Great China Rubber Factory, which originally proposed to catch up with the quality of British "Dunlop" tires within five years, has now had four quality technical standards catch up with or exceed "Dunlop"; all employees are full of confidence that they can completely catch up within three years. The Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory, which competed with Japanese products of the same kind in terms of silk spinning and cotton silk quality, after several days of hard work by the workers, wove extra-grade non-black-haired cotton silk on March 4th, four months ahead of schedule, with quality exceeding that of the Japanese "Dai Nippon" brand. Some of the quality of products such as fountain pens and shirts have also caught up with famous American brands.

Many factories with lagging production have recently leaped into advanced factories in the tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism. For example, the Li Hua Paper Mill, which has not fully completed the state plan for seven years, has seen its daily output rise sharply in recent days, reaching the level of the last year of the second five-year plan.

On the 14th, Shanghai held a grand worker representative meeting to review the production achievements of the Great Leap Forward, mobilizing all employees in the city to further carry out the competition to compare who is more advanced and who can achieve more, faster, better, and more economically, and to promote a great leap forward in production and culture.

    从炼钢炉旁到织布机畔
    生产奇迹层出不穷
    上海各厂比先进竞赛波澜壮阔
    本报特约新华社上海19日电　比先进、比多快好省的全面跃进的竞赛开始以后，几天来，上海工业战线上捷报频传。从炼钢炉旁到织布机畔，从车间到海洋，从万人大厂到只有几个人的小厂，到处出现奇迹。
    13日，钢铁工人一连创造了二十一个新纪录。在“赶上青岛”口号的鼓舞下，棉纺厂职工生产的优级纱如雨后春笋；全市已经有三分之二的棉纺厂出现了优级纱。杨树浦发电厂的职工提出：上海工农业生产要用多少电，我们就发多少电。他们从多方面挖掘潜力，争取今年多发电三亿度。
    全市有五百多个工厂提出一千零三十五种牌号的产品要赶上英、美等资本主义国家的质量水平。在最近短短十多天里，已经有十多种产品提前实现了这一目标。上海机床厂12日试制成功的一种高精度齿轮磨床，磨制出工作物的精密度超过了英国有名的奥柯脱工厂出产的齿轮磨床。原来提出要在五年内使汽车轮胎质量赶上英国“邓禄普”牌的大中华橡胶厂，现在已有四项质量上的技术标准赶上或超过了“邓禄普”；全厂职工信心百倍地认为，只要三年时间就可以完全赶上了。把绢纺和棉绸质量同日本同类产品比赛的上海绢纺厂，经过职工连日苦干，到3月4日就提前四个月织出了质量超过日本“大日本”牌的特级无黑发棉绸。金笔、衬衫等产品，也有一部分质量赶上了美国名牌货。
    很多生产落后的厂，最近在反浪费反保守浪潮中一跃成为先进厂。例如，七年来一直没有全面完成国家计划的利华造纸厂，近几天来，日产量直线上升，达到了第二个五年计划最后一年的水平。
    14日，上海市举行了规模盛大的工人代表会议，检阅了大跃进中的生产成绩，动员全市职工进一步开展比先进、比多快好省的竞赛，促进生产、文化大跃进。
