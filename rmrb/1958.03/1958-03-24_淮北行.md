    Journey to Huaibei
    By Our Correspondent Yu Ming
    The Changing Roads
    This time, I had the convenience of riding in a jeep from the Bengbu Special District and traveled to several counties in Huaibei. Our car went to many townships and communes, all on newly built, wide roads. These roads appeared along with the water conservancy projects undertaken last winter and this spring. In some places, the road is in the middle with ditches on both sides, while in others, the newly built embankments serve as large roads, with trees planted on both sides. Because ditches and ponds are being dug everywhere, some old roads have been cut off, and new roads must be taken to reach the destination. Comrade Lao Hu, the driver, has traveled this route two or three times since last winter, and each time he couldn't figure out the way due to the new changes. Not just the driver, but in the Jiashangou District of Sixian County, even the township head had to get out of the car with us to ask the locals for directions. On the way from Suixi to Chuanshan Lake, there was a section of road that was impassable. A commune cadre pointed us in a direction, but even that road turned out to be impassable. The reason was that he had only been away for work for a few days, and the surrounding situation had changed. Despite these difficulties, the car was filled with a cheerful atmosphere. Comrade Lao Hu, the driver, is from Huaibei, and he was particularly happy. He said, "Water management is closely related to our driving. In the past, when the heavy rains came in summer and autumn, cars couldn't go to the countryside. Now that the waterlogging has been controlled, it's not only good for the people, but cars can also go to the countryside without being blocked." All along the way, he told us that this place would become paddy fields, and that place would become orchards. He said, "After the roads are leveled and the trees grow tall, driving in Huaibei will be wonderful. Green trees line the road, with bright paddy fields on both sides. When you stop the car, you can eat fruit everywhere. That will be a great time!"
    Turning Huaibei into Jiangnan
    Put in more effort, ah ya hum,
    We will turn the depressions into good fields!
    Work harder, ah ya hum,
    Guanjia Lake will be greatly transformed!
    Lift with strength, eat rice,
    Huaibei will definitely become Jiangnan!
    This is the heroic declaration shouted by the members of the Youth Rice Improvement Team of the Huiguang First Commune in Sunting District, Suixi County, as they rapidly carry soil for the ditches. Turning Huaibei into Jiangnan has become the common action of all the people of Huaibei in building socialism. The low-lying areas of Guanjia Lake in the Huiguang First Commune used to be frequently affected by floods. Here, only one crop of wheat was planted a year, yielding just over forty catties per mu, and in the autumn it would be a vast expanse of water. In the spring of 1956, the masses built a small embankment as a water conservancy project and converted more than 120 mu of dry land to grow rice. This not only controlled the flooding, but also yielded more than 300 catties per mu. The surrounding dry-land crops, however, mostly failed due to waterlogging. Last year, although the rice yield was slightly lower due to a lack of water storage experience, 45 mu still yielded 640 catties per mu. Last winter, the entire commune devoted itself to water conservancy projects, preparing to convert a large amount of dry land into paddy fields.
    When we arrived at this commune, we saw a moving scene in these low-lying areas: a large embankment had already enclosed thousands of mu of land, with large ditches outside the embankment. These ditches were as long as nineteen li. Inside the embankment, twenty-five transportation and irrigation ditches were dug, crisscrossing and interconnected. Each ditch was dug four meters deep, and the ditches already held one to two meters of groundwater, clear to the bottom. With this water, the Huiguang First Commune will convert 4,000 mu to rice this year. How significant is 4,000 mu of rice? A commune cadre told me that the commune has more than 30,000 mu of land and more than 8,000 people. If the 4,000 mu of rice yields 800 catties per mu, it will enable the commune to have an average of 400 catties of grain per person. With the addition of a crop of wheat, which can also increase by dozens of catties per mu due to irrigation, the yield will be even higher. Because the large ditches outside the embankment are connected to the Hui River, and the small ditches inside the embankment are connected to the large ditches, sluice gates have been built at the mouths of the ditches to allow for both drainage and storage, eliminating drought and flood. The commune cadre told me that the remaining dry land will also be converted into paddy fields in two or three years! The commune cadres pointed to the newly planted trees along the ditches and roads, saying that when these trees grow tall in a few years, the entire commune will have a large supply of building materials, and there will be plenty of peaches, plums, and dates to eat and sell! Those large and small ditches will store water all year round, and there will be plenty of fish, water chestnuts, and lotus roots to eat and sell! In the future, the entire commune will be networked with waterways, with small boats traveling everywhere, saving a lot of manpower and animal power in transportation!
    In Huaibei, there are many places that are changing so rapidly. In the Chengdong Township of Huaiyuan County, the entire township has been networked with waterways. In the past eight years, the masses in this township only completed 80,000 cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy projects. From last winter to mid-February this year, they have completed 2 million cubic meters of earthwork, aiming to reach 4 million cubic meters. The earthwork completed in one winter and spring is equivalent to fifty times that of the past eight years! This township is also a plain depression. In the past, out of more than 50,000 mu of land in the township, 20,000 to 30,000 mu were frequently flooded and yielded nothing. In the past, "Mentioning the Huangniwa depression, people worried and feared, nine out of ten years were bad harvests, and there was no rice in the pot!" Now, Chengdong Township is a different story. The masses have built three large ditches across the township's land, connecting to the Huai River in the south and the Hui River in the north. They have also built many medium and small ditches and large ponds, tightly connected to each other. The groundwater here is as abundant as in the Huiguang First Commune of Suixi. The Huiguang First Commune can only operate boats on one area of land, but Chengdong Township can already operate boats throughout the entire township.
    As the plain depressions are being transformed piece by piece, what about the mountainous areas of Huaibei? We also went to see the communes near the mountains. The Hongxing Commune of Wuliu Township in the Jiashangou District of Sixian County has several large ponds, each covering dozens of mu of land. Next to the higher of these ponds is a small pool, with springs bubbling up from the bottom. These small springs keep water in the ponds all the time. Last year, the commune converted more than 2,000 mu to rice, and now they are digging two more large ponds, following the mountain contours. Before the large ponds are even finished, the underground spring water is already bubbling up. This commune has more than 8,000 mu of land and plans to convert more than 7,000 mu to paddy fields in a few years. In the Chuanshan Lake area of Suixi County, there is a United Fifth Commune, which is digging ditches and ponds, utilizing mountain water and groundwater to convert 70% of the commune's land into paddy fields this year, aiming for a yield of 800 catties. While we were staying in this commune, we saw the commune members coming back very late, and the next morning they were already at the construction site at dawn. The elderly and children in this commune were not idle either. They went up the mountain slopes to stack small stones into contour lines, preventing soil erosion, and planted various fruit trees on the mountain slopes. The elderly and children happily said that stacking mountain stones makes it easier to cut grass, and planting fruit trees means there will be fruit to eat in three to five years.
    Achieving Waterway Networking Ahead of Schedule
    While we were in Suixi County, we met Comrade Li Jian, the First Secretary of the Bengbu Prefectural Committee, who was inspecting water conservancy work in the countryside. He started by smiling and saying that his thinking had fallen behind the reality. Based on the current situation, the eight counties of Huaibei will not take five years, but three years to achieve waterway networking. He said that this year, the eight counties of Huaibei in the Bengbu Special District will convert 2.7 million mu to rice, averaging more than half a mu of paddy field per person for the five million people. Next year, another 5 million mu will be converted, averaging one and a half mu per person. The eight counties have a total of more than 20 million mu of land, and in three years, 12 million mu will be converted, averaging more than two mu of paddy field per person. He said that the eight counties of Huaibei will create more than 100 wealthy and beautiful "Little Jiangnan" areas this year. "Little Jiangnan" must meet the following conditions: first, the area must be networked with waterways, with ditches and ponds connected and interconnected, adjusting to each other, and not fearing drought or flood; second, a large amount of rice must be planted, turning low-yield into high-yield; third, the embankments and roads must be completely greened, with trees lining the roads and orchards forming forests; fourth, land and water transportation must be smooth, with cars and boats unimpeded.
    Listening to his words, I suddenly realized how important water is to people! In the past, the people of Huaibei suffered from the disasters of water damage. After liberation, the Party led the people to control water, turning water damage into water conservancy, and has achieved considerable results. Now, as long as the water is well managed and fully utilized, not only can drought and flood disasters be eliminated, and low-yield areas can be turned into high-yield areas, but also the problems of sanitation, fertilizer, greening, and transportation can all be solved along with it.
    Water, how precious it is to the people of Huaibei now!

    淮北行

    道路的变化
    这次得便搭乘蚌埠专区的吉普车，走了淮北几个县。我们的汽车到许多乡、社，都走在新修的宽广的汽车路上。这些汽车路是随着去冬今春兴修水利而出现的，有的地方，当中是路，两旁是沟，有的新修的圩堤上就是一条大路，这些道路的两旁都栽了树。因为到处都在挖沟打塘，有些旧有的道路被截断了，要走新辟的道路才能到达目的地。司机老胡同志，从去冬以来走过两三趟，每次都因有新的变化，摸不清应该怎样走法。不要说司机，我们在宿县的夹山沟区，连乡长和我们一起走，也要经常下车向群众问路。在濉溪到船山湖的途中，有段路走不过去，一位社干部便指引我们，谁知他所指引的道路也还是通不过去。原因是他刚刚出外工作了几天，周围的情况就改变了。虽然遇到这些困难，车里却充满了愉快的气氛。司机老胡同志是淮北人，他特别高兴，他说：“治水和咱们开车的关系也不小，以往夏秋大水一来，车子就不能下乡，这下治了水涝，不但对老百姓好，车子下乡也不受阻了。”他一路都告诉我们，这里将要变成水稻田了，那里将要成为果木林了。他说：“以后道路整平，树木都长高了，开车在淮北走吧，一路绿树夹道，两旁明光光的水稻田，停了车到处都可吃到水果，你看那阵才好哩！”
    淮北变江南
    加劲干呀，啊呀哼，
    要把洼地变良田呀！
    多努力呀，啊呀哼，
    关家湖就要大改样呀！
    加油抬呀，吃大米呀，
    淮北一定变江南呀！
    这是濉溪县孙町区浍光一社的青年稻改队队员们，在飞快地抬送沟土时喊出的豪语。把淮北变成江南，已经成了全淮北人民建设社会主义的一致行动。浍光一社的关家湖等低洼地区，是过去经常受水灾的地方。这里一年只种一季小麦，每亩收四十多斤，到秋天便是一片汪洋大水。1956年春天，群众兴修水利筑了一个小圩，在一百二十多亩旱地上改种了水稻，不但治了涝灾，每亩还收到三百多斤，周围秋季旱粮作物却因水涝大半没有收成。去年虽然因为缺乏蓄水经验，水稻产量稍低，但有四十五亩还收到亩产六百四十斤。去年冬天，全社的人便都投入了兴修水利，准备把大量的旱地改成水田。
    我们来到这个社时，看到了这些低洼地区的动人情景：一个大圩堤已经把数千亩的土地围起来了，圩外就是大沟，这些沟长达十九华里，圩内挖了二十五条交通灌溉沟，纵横交错，内外相通。每条沟都挖有四公尺深，沟里已蓄了一公尺到两公尺的地下水，清澈见底。有了这些水，浍光一社今年就要改种四千亩水稻。四千亩水稻的意义有多大呢？社干部告诉我，这个社有三万多亩地，八千多口人，如果四千亩水稻每亩产到八百斤，就能使这个社平均每人有四百斤粮食了。再加一季小麦，因为有了水浇，每亩也能提高几十斤。因为圩外大沟和浍河相通，圩内小沟又和大沟相通，沟口修了涵闸，便能排蓄相济，免除旱涝。社干部告诉我说，其余的大半旱田在两三年内也要改成水田！社干部们指着沟沿和道路两旁新栽的树木说，这些树几年后长高了，全社将得到多少建筑用材，将有多少桃、李和枣子可吃可卖！那些大沟小沟全年蓄水，该有多少鱼、菱、荷藕可吃可卖！以后全社都水网化了，小船到处通行，运输能省多少人力畜力！
    在淮北，像这样迅速改变面貌的地方很多。怀远县的城北乡，全乡都已作到水网化了。这个乡的群众过去八年才作了八万土方的水利工程，从去冬到今年2月中旬已作二百万土方的工程，要争取达到四百万土方，一个冬春的工程就等于过去八年的五十倍！这个乡也是一个平原洼地，过去全乡五万多亩地，经常遭涝灾无收的土地就有两三万亩。在过去，“提起黄泥洼，担心又受怕，十年九不收，锅里无米下！”现在，城北乡是另一个样子。群众在全乡的土地上修了三条大沟，南通淮河，北连浍河，他们还修建了许多的中小沟和大塘，沟塘紧紧相连。这里的地下水和濉溪浍光一社一样的旺盛。浍光一社还仅仅能在一片土地上行船，而城北乡却已能在全乡行船了。
    平原洼地一片片在改造，淮北的山区怎样呢？我们也去看了靠山的社。宿县夹山沟区五柳乡的红星社，有几口大塘，面积有几十亩地大，这些大塘中较高的一个塘，旁边有一个小水池，池里的泉眼一个个水花往上冒，就是这些小泉眼，就保持了几个塘里经常可以有水用。去年这个社改种水稻二千多亩，现在又就着山势在挖另外两个大塘了。大塘还没有挖成，地下的泉水又在突突的冒了。这个社有八千多亩地，要在几年内把七千多亩地改成水田。濉溪县的船山湖地区，有个团结五社，挖沟打塘，利用山水和地下水，今年要把全社70％的土地改成水田，产量达到八百斤。我们在这个社住着时，看到社员很晚回来，第二天早晨天刚亮时已经都在工地上了。这个社的老年人和小孩子也没有闲着，他们上山坡把山上的小石垒成一级一级的等高线，使水土不下山；他们在山坡上栽各种果树。老年人和小孩子们都高兴的说，垒了山石，割草不费劲；种了果树，三五年后就有果子吃了。
    提前实现水网化
    我们在濉溪县时碰到了正在农村检查水利工作的蚌埠地委第一书记李坚同志。他一开头就笑着说，思想又落后于实际了。根据现在情况，我们淮北八县不要五年，而是三年就能水网化了。他说，今年蚌埠专区淮北八县改种水稻二百七十万亩，五百万人口平均每人有半亩以上的水稻田；明年再改五百万亩，每人便合到一亩半。八县共有二千多万亩土地，三年以后改种到一千二百万亩，每人就能合到二亩多的水稻田了。他说，淮北八县今年就要创造一百多个富庶美丽的“小江南”，“小江南”要具备这样几个条件：一、地区水网化，沟塘相通水相连，互相调剂，不怕旱和涝；二、大量种植水稻，低产变高产；三、堤岸、道路两旁全部绿化，树木成行，果树成林；四、水陆交通顺畅，车船无阻。
    我听了他的话，猛然意识到，水这种东西，对人的关系多么重大啊！过去淮北的人民受尽了水害的灾难；解放以后，党领导人民治水，要把水害变为水利，已收到不小成效。现在，只要把水治好，充分利用，不但水旱灾害能消灭，低产区能变成高产区，而且清洁卫生、肥料、绿化、交通运输等的问题也都随着好解决了。
    水，现在对淮北人民，是多么可贵呵！
