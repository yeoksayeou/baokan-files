Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 27th: According to Antara News Agency, the area occupied by the Husein rebel group is shrinking daily. Indonesian government forces, having control of the entire Riau region of East Sumatra, have now reached the West Sumatra border and, after occupying Daruk, are advancing towards Sungai Dareh, dozens of kilometers southwest.

Sungai Dareh is a small town more than 100 kilometers east of Padang where rebel group leaders Husein and Sjafruddin held important meetings. West Sumatra is the main area seized by the Husein rebel group.

The report said that since the government forces took military action against the rebels in Central Sumatra, approximately 1,000 rebels have surrendered, defected, or been captured by government forces. Some units of the Husein and Nainggolan rebels have defected to the government forces in entire companies.

The report also stated that when the government forces advanced from the east coast of Bengkalis towards the Minas oilfield, they seized many weapons and ammunition, including rocket launchers and twelve boxes of rocket launcher shells, many light machine guns, Sten guns, three truckloads of ammunition, and twenty-two Garand rifles. The Garand rifle is not used by the Indonesian army.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 26th: Lieutenant Colonel Kaharuddin, who leads the government forces responsible for clearing out the rebels in Central Sumatra, said in Pekanbaru on the evening of the 25th that the rebels entrenched in the Riau region of Central Sumatra have been completely cleared out, and the government forces have taken control of the entire region.

Kaharuddin had just returned to Pekanbaru from the front line in Air Molek, more than 100 kilometers southeast of Pekanbaru. He told Xinhua reporters and other foreign journalists visiting Pekanbaru that in recent days, government forces had recovered important locations along the highway southeast of Pekanbaru, including Air Molek, Daruk, and Ningyak. Kaharuddin said that the government forces are now advancing towards Rumbai. Rumbai is on the highway to Padang, about 130 kilometers from Padang, an important stronghold seized by the rebel group.

Now, with the recovery of the Riau region, government forces control the entire east coast of Central Sumatra, cutting off the rebels' connection with Singapore. With the oilfields of the American Texaco Oil Company located in the Riau region, the excuse for the United States to send troops to the region to "protect" its nationals and property has been shattered.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 26th: Lieutenant Colonel Kaharuddin Nasution, commander of the Pekanbaru defense area in Central Sumatra, said on the evening of the 25th that foreign aircraft continue to airdrop weapons to the rebels. Foreign aircraft airdropped weapons over Payakumbuh, 30 kilometers southeast of Bukittinggi, on March 22nd and 23rd, twice on the 23rd alone.

Kaharuddin revealed this fact to Xinhua reporters and some foreign journalists who visited Pekanbaru. At the invitation of the military authorities, the reporters visited a batch of American weapons airdropped by foreign aircraft. Particularly noteworthy among the weapons were six American rocket launchers, clearly engraved with: "Bartman Electric Company, Rocket Launcher, 3.5 inches, M20AI (some are BI)." This weapon is particularly familiar to the Chinese people because during the Liberation War, the United States continuously transported this weapon to the Chiang Kai-shek group to oppose the Chinese people. The Chinese People's Liberation Army seized this American weapon in almost every campaign. However, this American weapon is unfamiliar to the Indonesian people. The Indonesian army does not have this weapon. An officer who declined to be named said that Indonesia had previously requested to purchase this weapon from the United States and some Western European countries, but they were unwilling to sell it to Indonesia.

These six rocket launchers were airdropped by foreign aircraft before the government forces recovered Pekanbaru. When the government forces recovered Sordang, 80 kilometers northeast of Pekanbaru, on March 15th, they seized another six rocket launchers of the same type. These American weapons are being exhibited near the office building of the American Texaco Oil Company in Dumai City.

### 中苏门答腊廖内地区叛军肃清  印度尼西亚政府军向巴东挺进  军方揭露外国飞机继续给叛军空投武器

    中苏门答腊廖内地区叛军肃清
    印度尼西亚政府军向巴东挺进
    军方揭露外国飞机继续给叛军空投武器
    新华社雅加达27日电  据安塔拉通讯社报道，侯赛尼叛乱集团盘踞的地区正在日益缩小。控制了东苏门答腊整个廖内地区的印度尼西亚政府军现在已经进抵西苏门答腊边境，在占领了打鲁克以后，正向西南几十公里的双溪达腊挺进。
    双溪达腊是叛乱集团头子侯赛尼和沙弗鲁丁等曾在那里举行重要会议的一个小城，在巴东东面一百多公里。西苏门答腊是侯赛尼叛乱集团窃据的主要地区。
    消息说，自从政府军对中苏门答腊叛军采取军事行动以来，叛军归顺、投降或被政府军俘掳的已经约有一千人。侯赛尼和奈恩戈兰叛军中有一些是整连倒戈归顺政府军的。
    消息还报道，当政府军从东海岸的望加丽向米纳斯油田挺进时，缴获了许多武器和弹药，其中包括火箭炮和十二箱火箭炮弹，许多轻机枪、司登式机枪、三卡车弹药，以及二十二支加仑式枪。加仑式枪是印度尼西亚军队中从来所没有的。
    新华社雅加达26日电　率领政府军负责在中苏门答腊肃清叛乱分子的卡哈鲁丁中校25日晚上在北干巴鲁说，盘踞在中苏门答腊廖内地区的叛军已经全部肃清，政府军已经控制了整个地区。
    卡哈鲁丁刚从北干巴鲁东南一百多公里的艾尔莫累克前线回到北干巴鲁。他对到北干巴鲁访问的新华社记者和其他外国记者说，最近几天来，政府军收复了北干巴鲁东南公路沿线的艾尔莫累克、打鲁克和宁岳等重要地方。卡哈鲁丁说，现在政府军正在向鲁务占碑挺进。鲁务占碑在通往巴东的公路上，距叛乱集团窃据的重要据点巴东约一百三十公里。
    现在，由于廖内地区的收复，政府军控制了中苏门答腊的整个东海岸，这样，就割断了叛乱分子同新加坡的联系。美国德士古石油公司的油田都分布在廖内地区，这个地区收复以后，美国要派军队到这一地区来“保护”它的侨民和财产的借口也就被粉碎了。
    新华社雅加达26日电　中苏门答腊北干巴鲁防区司令卡哈鲁丁·纳苏蒂安中校25日晚上说，外国飞机继续在给叛军空投武器。外国飞机曾经在3月22日和23日在武吉丁宜东南三十公里处巴雅公务的上空投下武器，在23日一天就投了两次。
    卡哈鲁丁是对前往北干巴鲁访问的新华社记者和一些外国记者揭露这个事实的。记者们在军事当局邀请下参观了一批外国飞机空投的美国武器。武器中特别引人注意的是六门美国火箭炮，炮上清楚地刻着：伯特曼电气公司制，火箭发射器，三·五英寸、M20AI（有的是BI）。这种武器对中国人民特别熟悉，因为在解放战争中，美国曾经不断地把这种武器运送给蒋介石集团来反对中国人民。中国人民解放军差不多在每个战役中都缴获这种美国武器。但是这种美国武器对印度尼西亚人民却是陌生的。印度尼西亚军队中没有这种武器。一位不愿意披露姓名的军官说，印度尼西亚过去曾经向美国和某些西欧国家要求购买这种武器，但是它们不愿意卖给印度尼西亚。
    这六门火箭炮是在政府军队收复北干巴鲁之前由外国飞机空投下来的。政府军在3月15日收复在北干巴鲁东北八十公里的硕顶时，又缴获了同样类型的另外六门火箭炮。这些美国武器正在杜迈城美国德士古石油公司办公大楼附近的地方展览。
