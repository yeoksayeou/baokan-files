On the Remuneration of Literary and Artistic Labor
Chun Cheng

I was very excited to see the many opinions expressed by artists and writers in the recent "People's Daily" symposium on the great leap forward in creative work. The veteran writers are rising up to make a leap forward, and with them taking the lead, a bumper harvest in the literary and artistic garden is predictable. Now I just want to talk about one issue.

Several writers, painters, and playwrights at the symposium all talked about the issue of manuscript fees and remuneration for theatrical performances. Their unanimous request was to lower labor remuneration. Their opinions were: manuscript fees are too high, reprinted works should no longer be paid manuscript fees, and manuscripts written during working hours should not be paid manuscript fees at all. They also reflected that painters teaching in colleges and universities are requesting self-sufficiency, and some theatrical troupes advocate not only not selling tickets for performances for workers and peasants but also bringing their own rations. This spirit, this drive, is admirable.

If this matter is handled properly, I think it will be beneficial to the literary and artistic undertaking itself, as well as to the readers and audiences who enjoy literature and art, and the writers and artists who create it. The reduction in the price of books, magazines, paintings, tickets… undoubtedly helps the popularization of literature and art. Of course, merely reducing the remuneration of creators alone is not enough to greatly affect the reduction of book prices, etc.; it can only play a partial role. There are also other reasons for the high cost of books, such as the publishing house, bookstore, and post office's management of publication and distribution. These works also need to be improved.

The benefits to readers and audiences are self-evident. What about the creators? Does lowering remuneration also benefit them? If you only look at the surface, you may feel there is a loss, but looking deeper, "A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise." Inappropriate and excessive remuneration is actually not very beneficial to writers and artists, and there are many disadvantages. Living a life of luxury that far exceeds the living standards of ordinary working people will only create a distance between artists and the masses. The weight of money will hinder the soaring of the soul. Extra and undeserved "profit" does not give any "freedom" but is a kind of restraint. Engaging in artistic creation for the sake of personal gain will certainly not yield good results. Even if one is not subjectively motivated by personal gain, objectively receiving excessive material enjoyment will still have adverse effects. Just from the perspective of public opinion, while hard work is certainly glorious, "getting more" is not as good as "getting less." Getting more only makes one feel empty and guilty, while getting less allows one to stand a little straighter.

Isn't "prolific writer" a term with a sarcastic undertone? On the one hand, "prolific" is seen as synonymous with shoddy work; on the other hand, it inevitably implies that being prolific is for the sake of getting more money. Therefore, writing less is better than writing more, and not writing is better than writing less. I have heard such discussions more than once. Some amateur writers have positions with regular salaries, either as professors or as cadres in government organs. Although they are capable of writing something, they are unwilling to do so. The reasons are varied, but one of them is fear that people will say they are writing for the sake of earning manuscript fees. Of course, there are also some people who write for the sake of personal fame and gain, neglecting their main duties. That must be criticized and opposed. We must oppose the idea of seeking fame and gain, and we must also promote amateur writing. We must abide by the principle of "to each according to his work," encouraging those who work more to get more and affirming that it is glorious for writers to be prolific, but we must also appropriately lower remuneration. If we can follow the proposals put forward by the writers and artists mentioned above, then "public criticism" will stop, and a certain kind of constraint on amateur writers can be lifted, that is to say, they can get more creative freedom. As for professional writers, that is naturally another matter. There should be appropriate manuscript fees to ensure the lives of professional writers. The social prejudice that does not recognize literary and artistic creation as a kind of labor, a kind of profession, and therefore can not pay remuneration is also wrong. We certainly do not advocate that young authors abandon their work too early and become professionalized too early. But it is undoubtedly beneficial to the prosperity of literature and art for qualified writers to become more professionalized.

Some people say that it is also necessary to prevent another deviation. In the past, there have been cases where literary and artistic organizations "supported" a group of creative cadres, paying them monthly salaries, and some individuals developed the mentality of "whether I work or not, it's all the same." For years, they "didn't write a word, but enjoyed all the benefits." Some state-owned theatrical troupes also rarely performed because of this. This phenomenon does exist, but it does not prove that we must use excessively high monetary and material rewards to stimulate literary and artistic creation. We must see that this is a socialist society, and under the new social system, a new social atmosphere is forming. Should the improvement of labor efficiency only rely on material rewards? Can we do everything as before, still following the old capitalist rules?

In short, the issue of remuneration for the labor of artists and writers in socialist society is a new issue that deserves to be studied and resolved.

    谈文艺劳动的报酬
    春城
    看到最近“人民日报”上发表的文艺家座谈关于创作大跃进的许多意见，很是兴奋。老作家们奋起跃进，由他们带头，文艺园地的丰收是可以预卜的。现在我只想谈一个问题。
    座谈会上有几位作家、画家、戏剧家都谈到了稿费问题和戏剧演出的报酬问题。他们的一致要求降低劳动报酬。他们的意见是：稿费偏高，转载的作品不能再发稿费，在工作时间写的稿子完全不应该发稿费。他们还反映，在院校任教的画家要求生产自给，有的剧团主张向工农群众演出非但不卖票，还要自带干粮。这种精神，这种干劲，是令人钦佩的。
    这件事只要做恰当，我想无论对于文艺事业本身，或者对于享受文艺的读者、观众以及创作文艺的作家、艺术家，都是有好处的。书价、刊物价、画价、票价……的降低，无疑地帮助了文艺的普及。当然，单独降低创作家一方面的报酬，也还不足以大大影响书价等等的降低，它只能起一部分的作用，构成书价昂贵的原因也还有其他种种，例如出版社、书店、邮局对于出版、发行的经营管理等。这些工作也还需要加以改进。
    对于读者和观众的利益，更不待言。对于创作家那方面呢？难道降低报酬对他们也有好处吗？如果仅仅从表面来看，也许会觉得有损失，但是更深一层看，“塞翁失马安知非福”。不恰当的过高的报酬对作家、艺术家实际上好处不多，坏处倒不少。生活享受超过普通劳动人民的生活水平太多，只会造成文艺家与人民群众之间的距离。金钱的重量会妨碍心灵的飞翔。额外的非分的“利”，并不能给以什么“自由”，反而是一种束缚。为了追求个人利益而从事艺术创造，固然决不可能得到好结果，即使自己主观上并不是为个人利益，客观上得到了过多的物质享受，也还是要产生不良影响。单就社会舆论来说，多劳固然光荣，“多得”却不如“少得”。多得只会使自己情虚，内疚，而少得可以使腰杆子挺得直一些。
    “多产作家”，不是一个带有讽刺意味的名词吗？一方面，“多产”被看作粗制滥造的同义语，另一方面难免不包含一种多产是为了多要钱的意味在里面。因此多写不如少写，少写不如不写。我还不止一回听到这样的谈论，有些业余作家本身有职务，月有定薪，或则当教授或则是机关干部，虽则他们能够写一些东西，却不愿意这样作，原因固然不一，但其中之一是怕人家说是为了挣稿费而写作。当然，也有一些人为了追求个人名利而写作，不务正业。那是必须批评反对的。我们既要反对名利思想，又要提倡业余写作。我们既要遵守按劳取酬的原则，鼓励多劳者可以多得，肯定作家多产是光荣的，我们又要适当地使报酬降低。如果能照上面说到的几位作家、艺术家所提出的倡议办，那么“物议”就会停止，业余作家们的某一种束缚可以解除，也就是说可以得到更多的创作自由了。至于专业作家，那自然是另一回事。应该有恰当的稿酬来保障专业作家的生活。那种不承认文艺创作是一种劳动、一种职业，因此可以不付报酬的社会偏见也是不对的。我们固然不提倡青年作者过早地脱离工作，过早地专业化。但是有条件的作家更多地专业化，无疑是有利于文艺的繁荣的。
    有人说，也还要防止另一种偏向。过去并不是没有发生过这样的事，文艺团体“养”了一批创作干部，按月支薪，个别的人就滋长了干不干二斤半的思想，几年来“不着一字，尽得风流”。有的国营剧团，也因此很少演出。这种现象的确存在，但是并不能因此证明我们非拿过高的金钱物质报酬来刺激文艺创作不可。要看到这是社会主义社会，在新的社会制度下，新的社会风气在形成。劳动效率的提高难道应该只依靠物质的奖励吗？难道能够一切照旧，还是按资本主义老章程办事？
    总之，社会主义社会里的文艺家的劳动报酬问题是一个新的问题，值得研究并加以解决。
