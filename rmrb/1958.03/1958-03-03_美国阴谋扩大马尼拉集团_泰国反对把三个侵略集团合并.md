Xinhua News Agency, Manila, March 2nd: The Southeast Asia Group has decided to hold a Council meeting in Manila from March 11th to 23rd. As a prelude to this meeting, the group will hold a military advisors meeting in Manila on the 6th. Currently, the armed forces of the United States and the Philippines are conducting a large-scale atomic warfare exercise in the Philippines, involving 80,000 personnel.

According to United Press International, citing sources in the Philippine Foreign Ministry, the Philippine government will attempt to realize the U.S. intention of uniting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact – these three aggressive military blocs – when the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization holds its Council meeting. According to United Press International reporter Hal Buell in a March 1st dispatch, the U.S. will also attempt to pull Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan into this military bloc.

In the course of Western news agencies continuously revealing the aggressive plots brewing before the Council meeting of this military bloc, United Press International also quoted Philippine Foreign Ministry sources on the 27th as reporting that the issue of pulling South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "will definitely be brought up" when South Vietnamese "President" Ngo Dinh Diem visits the Philippines in March. Philippine Foreign Ministry sources said that the issue of South Vietnam joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has been the subject of exploratory talks between the Philippines and South Vietnam since Ngo Dinh Diem expressed his desire to visit the Philippines last March.

According to a United Press International report from Padang, Central Sumatra, Indonesia, on the 1st, the “Foreign Minister” of the Central Sumatra rebel “government,” Simbolon, said that he might go to Manila “as an observer” to attend the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, March 2nd: Thai Prime Minister and Defense Minister Nai Thanom Kittikachorn told reporters on February 27th that Thailand absolutely cannot accept the suggestion of merging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization into one military bloc.

On the same day, Nai Thanom also said that Thailand would be willing to accept small rocket weapons if someone offered them. However, Thailand will not make any requests. He said that Thailand would also not accept rocket weapons with atomic warheads or long-range, giant rocket weapons.

    美国阴谋扩大马尼拉集团
    泰国反对把三个侵略集团合并
    据新华社2日讯　马尼拉消息：东南亚集团已经决定从3月11日到23日在马尼拉举行理事会会议。作为这次会议的序幕，这个集团将于6日在马尼拉举行军事顾问会议。目前，美国和菲律宾的武装部队正在菲律宾举行有八万人参加的大规模原子战争演习。
    据合众社援引菲律宾外交部人士的话说，菲律宾政府在东南亚条约组织举行理事会会议的时候，将设法实现美国把北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约组织这三个侵略性军事集团联合起来的意图。另据合众社记者霍布雪奇特在3月1日报道，美国还将设法把日本、南朝鲜和台湾蒋介石集团拉进这个军事集团。
    在西方通讯社不断透露这个军事集团在举行理事会会议以前所酝酿的侵略性阴谋的过程中，合众社在27日还曾经引述菲律宾外交部人士的话报道，在南越“总统”吴庭艳在3月间访问菲律宾的时候，把南越拉进东南亚条约组织的问题“一定会提出来”。菲律宾外交部人士说，自从吴庭艳去年3月表示想访问菲律宾以来，南越参加东南亚条约组织的问题一直是菲律宾和南越之间进行试探性会谈的内容。
    另据合众社记者1日从印度尼西亚中苏门答腊的巴东报道，中苏门答腊叛乱“政府”的“外交部长”西姆波朗说，他可能“作为观察员”前往马尼拉参加东南亚条约组织理事会会议。
    据新华社2日讯　曼谷消息：泰国总理兼国防部长乃他侬2月27日对报界说，泰国绝对不能接受把北大西洋公约、巴格达条约和东南亚条约三个军事集团合并在一起的建议。
    乃他侬同一天还说，泰国愿意接受小型火箭武器，如果有人提供的话。但是，泰国将不提出要求。他说，泰国也不接受带有原子弹头的火箭武器或远程的巨型火箭武器。
