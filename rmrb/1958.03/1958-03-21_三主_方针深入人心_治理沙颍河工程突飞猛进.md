Special Column: Transmitted by our newspaper’s special correspondent from Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The movement to fundamentally eliminate the harm caused by the Sha Ying River and develop its water resources in Henan Province is progressing at an astonishing rate.

The Xuchang Special Zone in Henan Province, which occupies the majority of the Sha Ying River basin area, deployed nearly 1.4 million laborers daily to this movement from late November of last year to the end of January this year. Within a short period of over two months, the completed projects, in some cases, exceeded the 1958 plan, and in others, reached over 70% of the annual plan. These completed projects can expand the irrigated area by 3.39 million mu, control and maintain soil and water conservation area of ​​597 square kilometers, and complete the waterlogging drainage area of ​​2.62 million mu in low-lying areas.

The people in the Sha Ying River basin are highly enthusiastic about fundamentally controlling the Sha Ying River, and the actions of the masses have led the local leading organs to repeatedly revise their plans. With the exception of Lushan County in the Xuchang Special Zone, where only two-thirds of the mountain management task was completed due to the large mountainous area and small population, the remaining six mountain counties, including Yu County and Baofeng, decided to complete all mountain management tasks ahead of schedule this year. The area of irrigated land will reach 80% of the cultivated land area; and the flatland depressions will be able to drain water when the initial rainfall is 200 mm, and the land will not be flooded. According to an understanding in mid-March, the people of Yu County, after a hundred days of hard work, victoriously completed the original five-year mountain management task. All of the county's 913 large and small mountains, and 860,000 mu of wasteland, including gullies and slopes, have been completely managed. At the same time, the county has basically achieved water conservancy and afforestation. Now, there are groups of reservoirs in the mountains, and ponds and cellars are all over the mountains, with soil and water not leaving the mountains, and paddy fields flying up the mountains, the appearance of the barren mountains has been completely changed. The irrigation area in the county has also been expanded to more than 1.13 million mu, accounting for 83% of the county's total cultivated land area, fundamentally eliminating waterlogging and drought disasters. Now, a large number of farmers in the plains area are also supporting the mountain management movement in the mountainous areas with great enthusiasm.

The reason why the masses are so enthusiastic about fundamentally controlling the Sha Ying River is first and foremost because the water management policy of "mainly water storage, mainly small-scale projects, and mainly community-run projects" is supported by the masses. Managing water according to this policy can be closely integrated with production, so that the projects can be effective in the same year, which can greatly enhance the confidence of the masses in managing water. Secondly, the farmland water conservancy projects that have been built during the drought resistance and wheat planting in 1956 and last year have played a very good role, which has benefited the vast number of farmers. Thirdly, after agricultural cooperation, farmers have relatively strong manpower and economic strength to build farmland water conservancy projects. Fourthly, party and government leaders at all levels attach great importance to this movement. The Xuchang Prefectural Party Committee of the CPC directly leads key counties such as Yu County, Lushan County, and Yanling County; and party and government leading cadres in each county also personally lead this movement.

The policy of "mainly water storage, mainly small-scale projects, and mainly community-run projects" to manage the Sha Ying River was proposed by the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC based on the experience of managing the Mang River. The Provincial Party Committee requires: strive to basically control soil erosion in mountainous and hilly areas within three years; basically eliminate ordinary water, waterlogging, and drought disasters; basically achieve water conservancy in the entire basin; and basically complete the transformation of low-lying areas and alkaline land in the basin.

### “三主”方针深入人心  治理沙颍河工程突飞猛进

    “三主”方针深入人心
    治理沙颍河工程突飞猛进
    本报特约新华社郑州讯　河南省根治沙颍河水害、开发沙颍河水利的运动正以惊人的速度向前猛进。
    占沙颍河绝大部分流域面积的河南省许昌专区从去年11月下旬到今年1月底，每天投入这一运动的劳动力近一百四十万人；在两个多月的短期内，已经完成的工程，有的超过了1958年的计划，有的达到全年计划的70％以上。这些已完成的工程可以扩大灌溉面积三百三十九万亩，控制保持水土的面积五百九十七平方公里，完成洼地除涝面积二百六十二万亩。
    沙颍河流域的人民根治沙颍河的劲头非常大，群众的行动使得各地领导机关一再修改计划。许昌专区除鲁山县因山大人少，完成治山任务的三分之二外，其余的禹县、宝丰等六个山区县决定在今年提前完成全部治山任务；水浇地面积达到耕地面积的80％；平原洼地做到初次降雨二百公厘时水不出坡，地不受淹。据本月中旬了解，禹县人民经过百日苦战，胜利地完成了原计划五年的治山任务。全县大小九百一十三个山头，八十六万多亩荒地面积包括沟壑斜坡，已全部治理完竣。同时全县又基本上实现了水利化和绿化。现在山区水库成群，塘窖满山，水土不出川，稻田飞上山，荒山的面貌完全改观。全县灌溉面积也扩大到一百一十三万多亩，占全县总耕地面积的83％，根本消灭了水旱灾害。现在，有大批平原地区的农民，也以高度的热情支援山区的治山运动。
    群众根治沙颍河的干劲足的原因，首先是“以蓄为主、以小型为主、以社办为主”的治水的方针受到群众拥护。按照这个方针来治水，可以密切结合生产，使工程当年见效，这就可以大大增强群众治水的信心。其次是1956年和去年抗旱种麦的时候，已经兴修的农田水利工程发挥了很好的作用，使广大农民得到了好处。第三是农业合作化后，农民兴修农田水利的人力和经济力量都比较雄厚。第四是各级党政领导都非常重视这一运动，中共许昌地委直接领导禹县、鲁山、鄢陵等重点县；各县的党政领导干部也多亲自领导这一运动。
    采取“以蓄为主、以小型为主、以社办为主”的方针来治理沙颍河，是中共河南省委根据治理漭河的经验提出的。省委要求：争取在三年内基本上控制山区、丘陵区水土流失；基本上消灭普通的水、涝、旱灾；基本上达到全流域水利化；流域内的洼地、碱地基本上改造完成。
