    Another Revolution
    According to preliminary investigation materials from Hubei Province, 40%-60% of all farm work relies on carrying and shouldering by people. For thousands of years, hundreds of millions of farmers have been engaged in this heavy labor year after year, which is both strenuous and has low labor efficiency.
    Can this phenomenon be changed under China's current situation? Hubei Province's answer is: yes. The method is to mobilize the masses, pool the wisdom of the masses, and reform transportation tools.
    To achieve a production leap, we must improve productivity. An important way to improve productivity is to reform technology and reform production tools. The realization of "vehicleization" in many places in Hubei Province, eliminating shouldering, and immediately turning labor efficiency several times over, is another clear proof.
    It is not just about eliminating shouldering, but also eliminating all backward tools that should be eliminated and reforming all that should be reformed. As long as we rely closely on the masses, we will certainly be able to achieve this goal. The improved farm tools that have newly appeared in Dangyang County are "colorful and varied," proving that the wisdom of the masses in this regard is endless.
    It is hoped that the experience of Dangyang County can blossom and bear fruit throughout the country.

    又一次革命
    据湖北省的初步调查材料，全部农活的40％—60％要靠人背和肩挑。几千年来，亿万农民成年累月地进行这种沉重的劳动，既费力，劳动效率也很低。
    这种现象在我国的现状下能不能改变？湖北省的回答是：能。办法就是发动群众，群策群力，改革运输工具。
    要生产跃进，就得提高生产力。提高生产力的一个重要办法，就是改革技术，改革生产工具。湖北省许多地方实现了“车子化”，消灭了肩挑，劳动效率马上翻了几番。就是又一个明证。
    不只是要消灭肩挑，还要消灭一切应当消灭、改革一切应当改革的落后工具。只要我们紧紧依靠群众，我们就一定能够达到这个目标。当阳县新出现的改良农具是“万紫千红”，证明群众在这方面的智慧是无穷无尽。
    希望当阳县的经验，能在全国各地开花结果。
