    The Drama "Song of Youth"
    Yi Zhou
    Recently, many drama troupes in various places have performed "Song of Youth," and the audience response has been very good. It is said that not long ago, the China Youth Art Theatre performed "Song of Youth" in Tianjin. Once, during a student performance, the audience was extremely enthusiastic. They didn't want to leave even after seven curtain calls; the play and the audience's hearts truly merged. "Song of Youth" depicts a group of agricultural university graduates who go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and establish technical stations. It describes the fluctuations and changes in their thoughts and feelings as they integrate with the farmers. It describes how these young people came to be, some of whom chose the right path, and some who chose the wrong one. This is such an attention-grabbing thing. The author wrote the voices of the people of our time with fresh and authentic feelings, so it can so excite the audience.
    Shen Qiwen, this young girl, embraced the ideal of serving the farmers and bringing science to the countryside, throwing herself into the ocean of agricultural production. When she encountered difficulties in controlling pests, she became discouraged, worried, and distressed... But she still had drive. After receiving help, she relied on the masses and worked hard to study, finally combining science with the farmers' rich production experience. She walked a broad, bright road. This girl's youthful vitality and spirit of persevering through hard work gave us encouragement and strength. But her lover, Ding Hui, came to the countryside with a head full of "ideals," "personal career," and "scientific papers." He didn't love the farmers, nor did he want to do good things for them, and even less was he there to train and transform himself through labor production. Instead, he wanted to find materials for scientific papers. So he could not live in the farmers' fiery production struggle, and as a result, he fell behind. Through the different attitudes of this couple towards career, science, and life, the dramatic conflict naturally unfolds, also intertwining their love. Although the plot of the drama is simpler, it is bright and full of vigor, making people feel the attraction of life.
    The Youth Art Theatre has two groups rehearsing this script, both played by relatively well-known and older actors playing these young girls and lads. Lu Xi and Ji Shuping played Shen Qiwen, and Yu Cun played Ding Hui. This is also a pleasing novelty, showing that they value new creations; one can also see the youthfulness in their artistic creation. When watching their rehearsal, one audience member said: At first, seeing Yu Cun and Lu Xi play college students felt unusual, feeling that they were older and their appearance was not suitable. But by the time the play was almost over, the feeling was different, completely making one believe that these were Ding Hui and Shen Qiwen in real life. Isn't this the power of artistic creation?
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance of "Song of Youth" mostly featured young actors. Xie Yanning and Huang Yin, who played Shen Qiwen and Little Nightingale, had rarely met the audience before. This time, they both performed well, especially Little Nightingale, who left a good impression on me. She portrayed this girl, who is different from Shen Qiwen in being quiet and thoughtful, as natural and lovely. The director's handling of the character of Ding Hui also has its unique aspects, enriching his inner life; he did not appear on the stage just to be criticized, but saw the complex threads of the character's ideological development, thus making up for the shortcomings of the relatively thin original work. But after watching the Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance, I felt that there was a lack of vigor on the stage, and the tone was also slower, so the play seemed more dull. Perhaps it won't be like this when it is performed more proficiently.
    It is also unusual for the two drama theaters in Beijing to perform "Song of Youth" at the same time; I think this is a good thing, and performing against each other is precisely a friendly competition. Different performances and different artistic treatments will also allow the same script to emit different brilliance. Of course, the audience also yearns for the theaters to stage more different new plays that reflect the current fiery struggle!

    话剧“青春之歌”
    意舟
    近来各地不少话剧团体演出了“青春之歌”，观众反应很好。听说不久前中国青年艺术剧院在天津演出“青春之歌”，有一次学生场，观众们的情绪热烈非常；谢幕七次还不愿意离开，戏和观众们的心真正交融在一起了。“青春之歌”描写一群农业大学毕业生，下乡参加农业生产，搞技术站，他们和农民结合的过程中，思想感情的波动和变化；描写这群年轻人是怎样走过来的，他们之中有走对的；也有走错了的。这是多么吸引人注意的事情呀。作者以新鲜而又真实的感情，写出了我们时代人民的声音，所以它就能如此地激动观众。
    沈绮文这个年轻的姑娘，她抱着为农民服务，把科学带到农村的理想，投身到农业生产的海洋里；为了治虫害遇到困难，她泄气、发愁、苦恼……可是她还有干劲，在得到帮助以后，她依靠群众，努力钻研，终于把科学和农民丰富的生产经验结合起来了。她走的是一条阳关大道。这个姑娘的青春活力和坚持苦干的精神，给了我们鼓舞和力量。可是她的爱人丁辉，却抱着满脑子的“理想”“个人事业”“科学论文”和她一起到了农村，他不爱农民，也不想替农民办好事，更不是为了在劳动生产中锻炼和改造自己，而是要找科学论文材料。所以他就不能在农民火热的生产斗争中生活下去，结果他掉队了。通过这对爱人对待事业、科学、生活的不同态度，自然地展开了戏剧的矛盾冲突，也纠葛着他们之间的爱情。戏剧情节虽然简单些，但明快而有朝气，使人感到生活的吸引力。
    青年艺术剧院有两组排演这个剧本，都是比较成名和年岁较大的演员来扮演这些年青姑娘和小伙子，演沈绮文的是路曦和冀淑平，于村扮演了丁辉。这也是使人高兴的新鲜事儿，说明他们很看重新的创作；也可以看到他们在艺术创作上的青春。在看他们彩排的时候，有一位观众说：开始看见于村和路曦演大学生真不习惯，觉着他们年岁大了，个儿也不合适。可是戏演到快完了，感觉却不同了，完全使人相信这就是生活中的丁辉和沈绮文。这不正是艺术创造的力量吗？
    北京人民艺术剧院演出的“青春之歌”，大多数是青年演员，演沈绮文和小夜莺的谢延宁和黄音过去很少和观众见面。这次都演得不错，特别是小夜莺给我留下了好印象，她把这个不同于沈绮文那样沉静深思的姑娘表现得自然可爱。导演对丁辉这个人物的处理也有独到之处，使他的内心生活丰富了；他不是为了被批判才出现在舞台上的，而是看到了这个人物思想发展的复杂线索，这样就弥补了原作中比较单薄的缺点。但是看完北京人民艺术剧院的演出，感到舞台上朝气不足，调子也慢了些，所以戏显得较为沉闷。也许演得更熟练时就不会这样了。
    在北京两个话剧院同时演出“青春之歌”，这也是不常见的事情；我想这也是好事，唱对台也正是友谊的竞赛。不同的演出，不同的艺术处理，也会使同一个剧本放出异彩的。当然观众也渴望着剧院能够排出更多不同的，又都是反映当前火热斗争的新戏来！
