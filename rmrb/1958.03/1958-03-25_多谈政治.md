    Talk More About Politics

    If we do not pay attention to ideology and politics and are busy with routine matters all day long, we will become economists and technicians who have lost their way. As long as ideological and political work is relaxed even slightly, economic and technical work will definitely go astray. But no matter what we do, if politics takes the lead, it will be easy to handle. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Second Ministry of Commerce used the method of "70% politics, 30% business" and the method of talking about politics first and then business in their factory director and bureau director meetings. As a result, the meetings were very successful. Not only did their thinking get on the right track, but their business also got on the right track.

    Ignoring politics and only focusing on business was a serious shortcoming of some economic departments before the rectification campaign. Under this atmosphere, when meetings were held, they only recited numbers, displayed market trends, assigned tasks, and argued endlessly, without mentioning "righteousness." When going down to inspect work, they only looked for the factory director, not the Party committee, let alone the trade union. Even when they found the factory director, they only talked about production and business, not about politics. In the eyes of these people, it was a matter of course that the administrative department was in charge of business and the local Party committee was in charge of politics; and as a Communist Party member, it was not surprising that they did not ask about politics when doing work. This bad style of some administrative leading organs has also been passed on to some administrative leading cadres of enterprises. As a result, bureaucracy, lifelessness, arrogance, extravagance, complaining, and departmentalism have been able to grow and spread.

    Now, the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Second Ministry of Commerce are beginning to reverse this trend, starting with the factory director and bureau director meetings. It can be said that this is also a revolution. The leading organs first got rid of the style of not asking about politics, and the unhealthy tendencies in enterprises were also easily eliminated. Truly both red and expert politicians and practically-minded people with clear direction will also increase day by day.

    多谈政治
    不注意思想和政治，成天忙于事务，就会成为迷失方向的经济家和技术家。只要思想工作和政治工作稍为一放松，经济工作和技术工作就一定会走到斜路上去。而不论做什么事情，政治一挂帅，就好办了。化学工业部和第二商业部用“七分政治，三分业务”的方法，用先谈政治后谈业务的方法，开厂矿长会议和局长会议，结果，会议开得很成功，不仅思想走上了正路，业务也走上了正路。
    不管政治，只管业务，这是一些经济部门在整风以前的严重缺点。在这种风气下，开起会来，只是念数字，摆行情，分任务，争争吵吵，言不及“义”。下去检查工作，只找厂长，不找党委，更不找工会。找厂长也只是谈生产、谈业务，不谈政治。在这些人看来，行政部门管业务，地方党委管政治，是天经地义的事情；而作为一个共产党员，做工作不问政治，反而不以为奇。某些行政领导机关这种不好的作风，也传给了一部分企业的行政领导干部，于是，官气、暮气、骄气、阔气、发牢骚、闹本位等等，也就得以滋长和蔓延。
    现在，化学工业部和第二商业部从厂矿长会议和局长会议开始扭转这种风气，可以说，这也是一种革命。领导机关首先革掉了不问政治之风，企业里的不正之气也就易于消除了，又红又专的真正的政治家和方向明确的实际家，也就会日益增多起来。
