    Let the Ancients Serve the Present
    Zheng Zhenduo
    We who are engaged in archaeological and classical literature research are dealing with ancient things. One question we should consider is: Should we turn ancient things into "antiques," or should we let them serve the present? The Institute of Archaeology has already put up 12,000 big-character posters. It seems we can no longer be conservative. In the past, the question of how ancient things can serve the present has often arisen. For example, how does studying Li Bai serve socialism? What is the use today of studying Han Dynasty stone carvings or excavating Neolithic sites? This question is very important because, in practical work, the idea of ​​archaeology for archaeology's sake and classical literature for classical literature's sake has not necessarily been eliminated. We must fight against these bad research attitudes and tendencies. Furthermore, in terms of ideological transformation, we should resolutely carry out socialist self-transformation, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois individualistic style, and establish a new socialist collective spirit.
    Is it necessary to reprint ancient books? It seems that too many are being printed now. One publishing house that publishes literature books printed more than 45% classical works last year. On the one hand, too many are being printed, and on the other hand, they are not being selected carefully, and they are being published in a chaotic manner, even some bad things. "Three Hundred Tang Poems" was printed 600,000 copies, and "Guan Zhi of Ancient Prose" was printed 200,000 copies. Whether there is still such a great need for these anthologies from the early Qing Dynasty today is doubtful. Some editors did not even look at the content of the books, but just looked at the title and sent them to print. Of course, some are good. But the important thing is that they did not consider how to make classical things suitable for today's needs. For example, why not use the eyes of Marxists and Leninists to select a new collection of Tang poems? In this era, the books we print must have distinctive features and must be different from those of the past. For example, the Twenty-Four Histories must have our own version of the People's Republic of China. Up to now, there is no Twenty-Four Histories with punctuation and indexes. It is not too difficult to do this, but it would be very useful for readers, but we have not done it. The Han Dynasty even had "scholars of chapters and sentences," why don't we do this?
    Therefore, I hope that in today's socialist era, someone will compile a selection of ancient poems and ancient prose with today's perspective. Each era has its own anthologies. And the criteria they choose are all permeated with the spirit of their era. "Selections of Refined Literature," was selected by Xiao Tong using his own literary criticism perspective. Wang Shizhen's "Selection of Ancient Poems" and "Ten Selections of Tang Poems," etc., Yao Nai's "Classified Compilation of Ancient Prose," and Zeng Guofan's "Miscellaneous Notes on Classics and Historical Writings," were also selected using their own perspectives. What each anthologist advocates, opposes, excludes, and supports is all displayed in their anthologies. We must select with a socialist perspective, and select what is beneficial and useful to us. We urgently need such anthologies. Furthermore, we must also consider how many copies of each ancient book should be printed based on our needs. Books that are beneficial and important to us can be printed in larger quantities. Those that are only for experts' reference should be printed in small quantities. We plan to publish 50 new anthologies during the Second Five-Year Plan. I think it is possible.
    In the past, research work was only for one's own "cause of fame," but now it must be "for the people," must serve socialist production and construction, and should no longer emphasize personal interests or expertise. We must abandon personal interests and contribute all of our expertise to serve the needs of the people, to serve the needs of workers, peasants, and soldiers today.
    Those engaged in archaeological and classical literature research must recognize that we are not working for "ancient times," for "ancient people," or for ancient cultural relics and classical literature. Our work is to serve the needs of today's industrial and agricultural production and construction. We must use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to sort out and criticize ancient books and cultural relics, rather than blindly worshiping, loving, being infatuated with, or playing with the ancient.

    让古人为今人服务
    郑振铎
    我们从事考古和古典文学的研究工作的，搞的都是古代的东西，应当考虑的一个问题就是：把古代的东西变成“古董”呢？还是让它为今天服务？考古研究所已经出了一万二千张大字报，看来再也保守不了。过去就常常发生古的东西如何为今天服务的问题。如研究李白，如何为社会主义服务？研究汉朝石刻，发掘新石器时代遗址，在今天有什么用处？这个问题很重要，因为在实际工作中，为考古而考古、为古典文学而古典文学的思想还不见得已消灭。我们必须和这些坏的研究态度和倾向作斗争。还有，在思想改造方面，应该坚决地实行社会主义的自我改造，彻底地批判资产阶级个人主义的作风，而树立社会主义的集体主义的新风气。
    重印古书是否需要？现在看来，似乎印的多了些。有一个出版文学书籍的出版社，去年印的古典作品就占45％以上。一方面是印得多了，一方面是不加选择，出得很乱，甚至乱出些坏的东西。“唐诗三百首”印了六十万册，“古文观止”印了二十万册。清朝初年的这些选本，在今天是否还有那末大的需要，是值得怀疑的。有些编辑先生并没有看看书的内容，只看一下书名就付印出书了。当然其中也有好的。但是重要的是，没有考虑如何使古典的东西适合今天的需要。比如，为什么不用马克思列宁主义者的眼光来选一本新的唐诗选呢？在现在这个时代，印的书必须有特点，要同以前的不同。如二十四史，一定要有中华人民共和国自己的版本。到现在为止，还没有分章断句、加索引的二十四史。这搞起来并不太难，对读者却大有用处，但是我们并没有做。汉朝还有“章句之儒”，我们为什么不这末做？
    因此，希望在社会主义时代的今天，有人来以今天的眼光编选古诗选、古文选。每个时代都有他们自己的选本。而他们所选的标准，都贯穿着其时代的精神。“昭明文选”，乃是萧统用他自己的文学批评眼光来选的，王士祯的“古诗选”和“十种唐诗选”等等，姚鼐的“古文辞类纂”，曾国藩的“经史百家杂钞”，也都是用他们自己的眼光来选的。每个选家，主张什么，反对什么，排斥什么，拥护什么，都在他们的选本里玩其手法。我们要用社会主义的眼光来选，要选对我们有益有用的。我们迫切需要这样的选本。还有，每部古书要印多少，也要看我们的需要，一些对我们有好处的、重要的书，可多印些。仅供专家参考的，则应少量地印。在第二个五年计划期间我们计划要出五十种新的选本，我看是可能的。
    从前做研究工作的，只是为了自己的“名山事业”，现在则必须“为人”，必须为社会主义生产建设服务，不应该再强调什么个人的兴趣或特长的了。必须抛掉个人的兴趣，把个人的特长，全部地贡献出来，为人民的需要服务，为工农兵今天的需要服务。
    从事考古和古典文学研究工作的人，必须认清楚，我们不是为了“古代”，为了“古人”，或为了古的文物和古典文学而工作的。我们的工作是为今天工农业生产、建设的需要服务的，我们要以马克思列宁主义的观点来整理、批判古书和古物，而不是盲目地崇古、爱古、迷古、玩古的。
