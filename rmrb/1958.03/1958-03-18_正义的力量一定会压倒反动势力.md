    The Power of Justice Will Surely Overcome the Reactionary Forces
    Commentator of this newspaper

    The Indonesian government's resolute actions to suppress the rebel group have stirred up a strong patriotic upsurge throughout Indonesia. On March 16, President Sukarno delivered inspiring speeches at mass rallies in Jakarta and Bandung, pushing this patriotic movement to a new peak. President Sukarno called on the people of the whole country and all parties to unite closely and firmly support the current central government. He said with confidence: "With your help, we will surely eliminate these traitors from the face of the earth!" This is the current action program and battle cry of the eighty-four million Indonesian people.

    President Sukarno pointed out that the activities of the Hussein rebel group were "not only reactionary, but also constitute a counter-revolution." They fundamentally violated the 1945 Declaration of Independence, undermined national unity, and attempted to sell Indonesia to foreign forces, seriously threatening Indonesia's independence. Therefore, the Indonesian people understand that to defend national independence and unity, they must support the central government, mobilize all the forces of the country, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the rebels!

    The Indonesian people also clearly realize that their struggle against the rebels is also a struggle against imperialist aggression. As President Sukarno pointed out, "those who do not like our non-aligned policy" are trying to drag Indonesia into major power blocs, and the rebels in Central Sumatra are "foreign-employed agents who are being used by foreign countries to drag Indonesia into these blocs." It is clear that the irreconcilable conflict between the Indonesian people and the rebel group reflects their inability to coexist with colonialism. President Sukarno has solemnly declared, "Indonesia will always oppose colonialism!" Inspired by this slogan, the Indonesian people's struggle against colonialism and to safeguard independence and sovereignty will undoubtedly be further developed.

    Of course, the imperialists who single-handedly caused the Indonesian rebellion will not easily give up. After the Manila Conference, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is carrying out various conspiracies to further interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. The United States openly used aircraft to airdrop weapons and ammunition to the rebels in Central Sumatra, and US warships are still stationed near Central Sumatra to "observe the development of the situation." At the same time, the US State Department publicly declared that they would study the "legal implications" of the Indonesian government's blockade of the rebel areas, attempting to prepare an excuse for foreign intervention. Officials in Washington even shouted that they "still believe" that President Sukarno must "compromise" with the rebels. However, this will only arouse greater anger among the Indonesian people and lead them to resolutely eradicate the rebels and crush any conspiracy of foreign intervention.

    Now, with the support of the people of the whole country, the government army has recovered several important cities in Central Sumatra, and all the oilfields of the US Texaco Oil Company in Central Sumatra have been controlled by the government army. The arrogance of the rebels has plummeted. The patriotic spirit of the Indonesian people has been further promoted. The Indonesian rebellion supported by imperialism once seemed very rampant, but as long as the people of the whole country unite, mobilize, and resolutely fight, then even if there are still difficulties on their way forward, the power of justice will eventually overcome the reactionary forces. All righteous people can confidently expect that, under the leadership of President Sukarno, the heroic struggle of the Indonesian government and people to safeguard their national independence and unity will achieve final victory!

    正义的力量一定会压倒反动势力
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚政府坚决讨伐叛乱集团的行动，已经使印度尼西亚全国出现一个声势壮大的爱国主义热潮。3月16日，苏加诺总统在雅加达和万隆的群众集会上发表了鼓舞人心的演说，更把这个爱国主义运动推向新的高峰。苏加诺总统号召全国人民和各党派紧密地团结起来，坚决支持现在的中央政府。他满怀信心地说：“在你们的帮助下，我们一定要把这些叛徒从地球上消灭掉！”这就是八千四百万印度尼西亚人民当前的行动纲领和战斗口号。
    苏加诺总统指出，侯赛尼叛乱集团的活动“不仅是反动的，而且构成了反革命”。他们根本违背了1945年的独立宣言，破坏了国家的统一，他们企图把印度尼西亚出卖给外国势力，严重威胁了印度尼西亚的独立。因此，印度尼西亚人民懂得，要保卫国家的独立和统一，就必须支持中央政府，动员全国的一切力量，坚决彻底消灭叛乱分子！
    印度尼西亚人民并且清楚地认识到，他们同叛乱分子之间的斗争，也就是同帝国主义侵略势力的斗争。正如苏加诺总统指出，“那些不喜欢我们的不结盟政策的人们”，企图把印度尼西亚拖进大国集团，而中苏门答腊的叛乱分子，就是“外国正在设法把印度尼西亚拖进这些集团的外国雇用的代理人”。很显然，印度尼西亚人民同叛乱集团的势不两立，正是反映了他们同殖民主义不可能共处。苏加诺总统已经庄严地宣布，“印度尼西亚将永远反对殖民主义！”在这个口号的鼓舞下，印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义，维护独立主权的斗争无疑地会得到更大的发展。
    当然，一手造成印度尼西亚叛乱事件的帝国主义，是不会轻易罢手的。在马尼拉会议以后，以美国为首的帝国主义集团正在进行各种阴谋活动，进一步干涉印度尼西亚的内政。美国公然用飞机向中苏门答腊叛军空投武器和弹药，美国军舰仍然停在中苏门答腊附近“观察局势的发展”。同时，美国国务院公开宣称，他们要研究印度尼西亚政府封锁叛乱地区的“法律影响”，企图给外国干涉准备借口。华盛顿的官员甚至大喊大叫说，他们现在“仍旧认为”，苏加诺总统必须同叛乱分子“妥协”。但是，这只会激起印度尼西亚全国人民更大的愤怒，并且起来坚决铲除叛乱分子，粉碎任何外国干涉的阴谋。
    现在，在全国人民的支持下，政府军已经收复了中苏门答腊的几个重要城市，美国德士古石油公司在中苏门答腊的全部油田地区已为政府军所控制。叛乱分子的气焰已经一落千丈。印度尼西亚全国人民的爱国主义精神更加发扬起来。帝国主义所支持的印度尼西亚叛乱活动看起来曾经十分嚣张，但是只要全国人民团结起来，动员起来，坚决进行斗争，那么即使在他们前进的道路上还有困难，正义的力量终归会压过反动势力的。一切正义的人们都可以满怀信心地期待，在苏加诺总统领导下，印度尼西亚政府和人民维护自己国家独立和统一的英勇斗争将会取得最后的胜利！
