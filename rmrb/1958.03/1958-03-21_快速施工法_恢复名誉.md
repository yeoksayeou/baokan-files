　　This newspaper's special dispatch from Luoyang, March 20th (Xinhua News Agency) – The rapid construction experience of building workers on the First Tractor Factory construction site, who completed a large factory building in thirty-eight working days, is now being widely promoted on many construction sites in Luoyang, restoring the reputation of the rapid construction method.
　　The rapid construction experience of thirty-eight working days is a creation of our country's construction workers. In the spring of 1956, the Luoyang construction engineering teams under the Ministry of Construction Engineering promoted a series of new construction technologies, such as the Soviet Union's mechanical surface compaction, integrated hoisting, and dry-hard concrete, during the construction of the First Tractor Factory's engine workshop. As a result, this large factory building, which usually took half a year to build, was completed in only thirty-eight working days. This advanced construction method not only accelerated the progress of the project but also saved a great deal of cement, formwork, construction equipment, and labor, greatly reducing the cost of construction; the quality of the project was basically good. This experience caused a sensation at the time. However, due to poor management and inadequate rain protection measures, one of the three hundred and two foundations that had been built settled beyond the permissible range; it still met the quality requirements after being remedied. Later, because the construction progress of the tractor factory slowed down and the construction department had insufficient tasks, some people proposed that the thirty-eight-day construction method did more harm than good and was too rash. Since then, this construction method has not been used again.

### “快速施工法”恢复名誉

    “快速施工法”恢复名誉
    本报特约新华社洛阳20日电　建筑工人们在第一拖拉机厂建设工地上创造的三十八个工作日建成一座大型厂房的快速施工经验，现在又在洛阳的许多建设工地上普遍推广，给快速施工法恢复名誉。
    三十八个工作日的快速施工经验，是我国建筑工人们的一项创举。1956年的春天，建筑工程部所属的洛阳建筑工程队伍，在建设第一拖拉机厂发动机工场的时候，推行了苏联的机械表面夯实、综合吊装、干硬性混凝土等一系列的施工新技术，结果通常需要半年才能建成的这座大型厂房，只用三十八个工作日就建成了。这一先进的施工方法，不仅加快了工程的建设进度，还节约了许多水泥、模板、建筑器材和劳动力，使建筑工程的成本大大降低；工程质量基本良好。这个经验当时曾轰动一时。但是，由于管理不善，防雨措施没有作好，在建成的三百零二个基础当中，有一个基础沉陷超过允许的范围；经过补救以后仍达到了质量要求。后来，因为拖拉机厂的建设进度放慢，施工部门的任务不足，这个时候就有些人提出，三十八天的施工方法，是害多利少，太冒进了。从此以后，这一施工方法再也没有运用。
