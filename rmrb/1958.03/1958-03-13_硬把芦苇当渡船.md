Insisting on Using Reeds as a Ferry
Commentator of this newspaper

U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell announced on the 11th that the number of unemployed people in the United States had increased to 5.2 million in February; an increase of nearly 700,000 in one month from mid-January to mid-February. U.S. officials admitted that this figure is the highest in sixteen years.

Although this number has been deliberately reduced, it has already frightened the U.S. ruling group. Of course, they are not afraid of the tragic situation of the unemployed workers, but are trembling for the rapid deterioration of the U.S. economic situation shown by this number.

People know that in order to cheer up the U.S. economy, which had already shown signs of recession, the U.S. President issued a statement on the economic situation on February 12, deciding to take measures such as increasing military order contracts, increasing public works expenditures, and relaxing credit conditions for building houses to promote the so-called "recovery" of the U.S. economy. In that statement, Eisenhower also expressed full confidence that March would see an increase in employment opportunities and would become "a sign that the economic decline is beginning to end." Now, the end of the economic decline has not appeared, but the situation of further deterioration of the economic situation has appeared.

In this case, even U.S. Vice President Nixon, who has always been the most enthusiastic about Eisenhower's measures to "restore" the U.S. economy, has lost confidence. On March 10, he completely changed his tone, admitting that relying on measures such as increasing public works expenditures to stop the development of economic recession "may be ineffective." Many influential figures in the U.S. ruling group, including Nixon, are clamoring for the immediate implementation of "comprehensive tax cuts" as an emergency measure. U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell also announced that the tax cut measure "has been fully considered" and "will be adopted when necessary."

What a big change in a month. The measures that the U.S. government announced a month ago to hinder the continued development of the economic recession have not been fully implemented, and they have become "may be ineffective"; now they have to turn to tax cuts, which completely contradict the measures to increase government spending. However, while preparing to cut taxes, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy is demanding continued increases in military spending. These contradictory phenomena show the extent to which the U.S. ruling group has fallen into a state of panic under the cloud of serious deterioration of the economic situation.

The question now is: Is tax cutting an effective solution? Western news agencies reported that the New York Stock Exchange's reaction was: this is a "bomb with little power." Anyone with a little common sense will know that increasing government spending on the one hand and implementing tax cuts on the other will only promote the malignant development of inflation. Therefore, this is just the idea of insisting on using reeds as a life-saving ferry.

    硬把芦苇当渡船
    本报评论员
    美国劳工部长密契尔于11日宣布，美国的失业人数在2月份已增加到五百二十万人；从1月中旬到2月中旬的一个月中增加了近七十万人。美国官方承认，这个数字是十六年来的最高数字。
    虽然，这个数字是被故意缩小了的，但是，它已经使美国的统治集团吓得胆战心惊了。当然，他们并不是为失业工人的悲惨处境害怕，而是为这个数字所显示的美国经济情况的迅速恶化而战栗。
    人们知道，美国总统为了给早已出现衰退现象的美国经济打气，曾在2月12日发布关于经济情况的声明，决定采取增加军事订货合同、增加公共工程开支和放宽建筑房屋的信贷条件等措施，来促使美国的经济得到所谓“恢复”。在那个声明中，艾森豪威尔还曾满怀信心地表示，3月份将会看到就业机会开始有所增加，并将成为“经济下降趋势开始结束的标志。”现在，经济下降开始结束没有出现，但是经济情况更加恶化的情况却出现了。
    在这种情况下，连一向对艾森豪威尔“恢复”美国经济的措施鼓吹最力的美国副总统尼克松，也失去了信心。他在3月10日已完全换了一副腔调，承认依靠增加公共工程开支这一类措施来阻止经济衰退的发展“可能是无效的”。包括尼克松在内的许多美国统治集团的当权人物，都在大嚷大叫地主张立刻实行“全面减税”，来作为一种应急的办法。美国劳工部长密契尔并宣布，减税的措施“已经受到充分考虑”，“必要时就会采用”。
    一个月之间，发生了多大的变化。美国政府在一个月前宣布要采取的阻碍经济衰退继续发展的办法还未充分实施，都已经成为“可能是无效”的了；现在竟不得不转而乞灵于与增加政府开支办法完全矛盾的减税措施。但是，一方面准备减税，另一方面美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊又在要求继续增加军事费用。这种矛盾百出的现象，说明美国统治集团在经济情况严重恶化的乌云的笼罩下已经陷于何等手足失措的境地。
    现在的问题是：减税是有效的办法吗？西方通讯社报道的纽约股票交易所的反应是：这是一颗“威力不大的炸弹”。稍有常识的人都会知道，一方面增加政府开支，一方面又要实行减税，这只会促成通货膨胀的恶性发展。所以，这只不过是硬把芦苇当作救命的渡船的想法罢了。
