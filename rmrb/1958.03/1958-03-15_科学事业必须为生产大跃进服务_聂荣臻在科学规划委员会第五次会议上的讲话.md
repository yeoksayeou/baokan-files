Scientific Undertakings Must Serve the Great Leap Forward in Production
Speech by Nie Rongzhen at the Fifth Meeting of the Scientific Planning Commission

    This meeting has been very successful. In the reports and speeches at the general meeting and in the discussions in the groups, everyone expressed many good opinions, fully reflecting the spirit of the rectification movement and the vigor of the Great Leap Forward. This meeting has played a role in promoting and encouraging the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings. Everyone unanimously agreed with the report made by President Guo Moruo, "Strengthening Sino-Soviet Cooperation and Fighting to Promote the Great Leap Forward in Scientific Undertakings," believing that learning from the Soviet Union and strengthening Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation are an important guarantee for the development of China's scientific undertakings. Everyone also agreed in principle with the reports of Deputy Secretaries-General Jiang Junch en and Wu Heng and the plan on information work. The meeting also adopted in principle the 1958 Scientific and Technological Research Plan and the key projects in natural sciences and philosophy and social sciences. After the meeting, we will make some necessary revisions to these documents and submit them to the State Council for approval and implementation. 1958 is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. Doing a good job in 1958 is of great significance for completing and over fulfilling the Second Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the 1958 plan must be earnestly implemented, and every effort must be made to complete and strive to over fulfill it. In the process of implementation, it is possible and necessary to make some supplements and revisions to the plan. Now I would like to say something more about how to achieve a Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings, based on everyone's speeches at the meeting.

    The Current Situation is: A National Mobilization, A Great Leap Forward in Production

    Before discussing these issues, I would first like to talk about the situation. Since the Scientific Planning Commission held its Fourth Enlarged Meeting last June, only nine months have passed. However, during this period, the overall situation in the country has undergone tremendous changes. In particular, the recent deepening of the nationwide rectification movement and the unfolding of the movement to oppose waste, oppose conservatism, compare with the advanced, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has brought about a new atmosphere unprecedented in the entire country. As the newspaper said: "The mass movement is galloping like ten thousand horses, and the political situation is lively and vigorous." Socialist democracy has been fully developed in our country. In the anti-waste and anti-conservative movement, the broad masses of cadres and people used forms such as big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates to say what they wanted to say, feeling very comfortable, and burning all phenomena of waste and conservatism, leaving no place for official airs, stagnation, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness to hide. In the movement, many astonishing deeds have already emerged, and many advanced indicators have appeared that were difficult to achieve or even imagine on ordinary days. In industry, many factories and mining enterprises have repeatedly broken the original planned targets. The 1958 economic development plan adopted by the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress in February this year projected an increase of 14.6% in the total value of industrial output this year compared with last year, which is already a leap forward plan to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and its major industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer. Now, according to the advanced plans put forward by various regions and factories and mines across the country in the Great Leap Forward, the industrial growth rate this year will greatly increase compared with the original plan. In agriculture, the agricultural development program originally planned to be completed by 1967 is expected to be completed in many areas in the next six or seven years or even shorter. Not to mention anything else, the newly expanded irrigation area this year has reached more than 210 million mu, far exceeding the original plan of 92 million mu, and will increase further by the end of the year. Some provinces can basically achieve water conservancy this year or next year. Now everyone is racing against time, leaving the old indicators far behind. The current situation is truly: a national mobilization, a Great Leap Forward in production. Now everyone can see very clearly that the rectification movement that began last year is indeed a very profound socialist revolutionary movement. All revolutionary movements result in great ideological liberation and great liberation of productive forces. In 1949, the Chinese people drove away imperialism, overthrew bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, and were liberated from the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. After this revolution, although a strong socialist state-owned economy has been established, the ownership of capitalist means of production and backward, scattered small-scale production still constrained the development of social productive forces. In 1956, the Chinese people completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and were completely liberated in terms of ownership of the means of production. The revolution completed in 1956 was much more profound in its social significance than the revolution completed in 1949. It uprooted the roots of class exploitation. However, after the 1956 revolution, the bourgeois rightists had not yet suffered a fatal blow politically, and many people had not yet ideologically drawn a clear line with the bourgeoisie, and the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of people had not been fully developed. The socialist revolution on the political and ideological front in the past year is another great ideological liberation of the Chinese people and another liberation of productive forces in our country. This great liberation is first and foremost concretely manifested in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    The Great Leap Forward in Production Requires a Great Innovation in Production Technology

    With the Great Leap Forward in production, a great innovation in production technology is required, and advanced production tools should be used to replace backward production tools, and advanced production methods should be used to replace backward production methods in a planned way with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses must be combined with technological reform. In the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, many articles are technical measures. This is true for agriculture, and even more so for industry. In order to realize technological innovation, we must grasp the advanced scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and other countries in the shortest possible time, and conduct creative research based on China's actual conditions. At the same time, we must carry forward China's scientific heritage, summarize the production experience of the masses, so that the most urgently needed scientific and technological departments in our country can approach or catch up with the advanced world level by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, it is required to popularize scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses of people and improve the scientific and technological level of workers and peasants in our country.

    The development of philosophy and social sciences is also indispensable for the Great Leap Forward in production. Philosophy and social sciences play an important role in studying the laws of socialist construction, studying how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, overcoming bourgeois ideology, and raising the socialist awareness of the masses. The work of philosophy and social sciences should also develop greatly with the Great Leap Forward in production. Comrade Chen Boda has already made many important opinions on how to achieve a leap forward in philosophy and social sciences, and I very much agree with these opinions.

    The Dialectic of Production and Scientific Development

    The requirements of production development promote the development of science, and the development of science in turn promotes the development of production. This is the dialectic of production and scientific development. Now is the time when the Great Leap Forward in production urgently requires a Great Leap Forward in science. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China more than eight years ago, especially since the Central Committee of the Party put forward the call to march towards science, our country's scientific undertakings, including both natural sciences and philosophy and social sciences, have developed rapidly, work has made considerable achievements, and some experiences have been gained, laying the foundation for the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings in the future. However, until now, our country's natural resources are still not very clear, many important issues raised in industrial and agricultural production have not been studied, many important scientific departments are still very weak, and some are still blank departments. This current situation of China's scientific undertakings is very inconsistent with the needs of the current Great Leap Forward in production. Therefore, we should take on this huge and glorious task of promoting the Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings.

    The Fundamental Policy of Scientific Undertakings

    In order to realize the Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings, it is necessary to clarify the fundamental policy that science must serve the Great Leap Forward in production. Science itself is not an end, and science for science's sake is an extremely wrong point of view. Science must serve production, and today it must serve the Great Leap Forward in production. If this is not clear, China's scientific undertakings will lose their direction. If scientific undertakings are divorced from practice and the masses, they will lose their huge driving force and become dim.

    How can science and technology serve the Great Leap Forward in production?

    The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production puts forward a large number of important issues that need to be resolved urgently by science and technology. We must solve these problems and support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production through a large amount of scientific research work. The important research topics that constantly emerge in the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production should all be included in the national plan.

    It must be pointed out that China is still a technologically backward country. Not only are backward hand tools used in agricultural production, but even in industrial production, although there are a certain number of modern large-scale industries, small-scale industries and handicrafts account for a considerable proportion. Improving relatively backward production tools and production methods, although from the perspective of modern scientific research, many are not too complicated, has a very significant impact on the development of China's national economy. Chinese scientific workers should never underestimate this kind of work, and must take an active attitude to support this kind of work. In this regard, the Science and Technology Association and Popular Science should carry out organization and promotion work.

    Of course, in today's era when human history has entered the atomic energy age and a new era of conquering nature, we must actively achieve rapid development in the latest science and technology, raise China's science and technology and productive forces to a higher level, and continuously leap forward. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate a certain amount of strength to develop these scientific and technological departments. Sufficient attention should be paid to theoretical and exploratory work that is closely related to the country's long-term construction.

    The most fundamental problem is the scientific team. The bourgeois ideological style of certain scientific workers must be criticized

    In order to strive for the Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings, the most fundamental problem is the scientific team. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, Chinese scientific workers have worked actively and made many achievements, and their political and ideological awareness has also been continuously improved. In particular, after the anti-Rightist and rectification movements, their socialist awareness has been greatly improved. This should be affirmed first of all. However, judging from the situation revealed in the rectification in scientific research institutions and universities, the bourgeois ideology and work style of certain scientific workers have brought no small harm to the development of China's scientific undertakings. Without carrying out rectification and criticizing these bourgeois ideologies and work styles, it is impossible to achieve a leap forward in scientific work.

    We have formulated a plan for the development of scientific undertakings, requiring scientific research to serve the country's socialist construction. However, because some scientific workers put personal fame and fortune and personal interests before the needs of the country, the spirit of carrying out scientific research according to plan cannot be implemented. Some people seem to be implementing the national plan on the surface, as if they are taking the socialist road, but in fact they are still following the capitalist path, unwilling to accept the research tasks assigned by the state, and unwilling to study major scientific issues related to reality.

    The importance of scientific coordination is recognized by everyone. However, due to the作祟 of bourgeois individualism, some scientific workers are extremely parochial, arrogant and conceited, look down on each other, and therefore cannot help each other, cooperate sincerely, or even exclude and attack each other, hindering the progress of coordination work. Some scientific workers also have extremely serious ideas of private ownership of knowledge, and are unwilling to contribute science and technology to the people. They monopolize rare or relatively new materials and are unwilling to exchange experiences with others.

    This bourgeois view of looking down on the creative role of the working masses in the development of science is also relatively common among scientific workers. In the practice of industrial and agricultural production, medical treatment, etc., the masses have many important inventions and creations, and scientific workers have the obligation to learn and summarize them scientifically. In the field of philosophy and social sciences, the importance of summarizing the experiences created by the masses in class struggle and in the struggle for production cannot be ignored. However, many philosophical and social science workers still have a serious tendency to not connect with the masses and not contact reality, which must be corrected.

    In the movement, it was also revealed that some scientific workers have conservative and backward phenomena in their work. The reason for being conservative and backward is often mainly that they are unwilling to study diligently and learn diligently. After many people have obtained a certain social status, they have not sought progress for a long time, they are stagnant, and they stubbornly stick to the old ways. They not only no longer personally engage in research work, but even do not read new literature. Some people have even fallen behind in their academic work, but instead of becoming alert and catching up, they intentionally or unintentionally reject correct opinions and suppress the growth of young forces, insisting that young people work according to their outdated old methods, hindering the progress of scientific undertakings. In the rectification movement, many such examples have been revealed: some young people have made relatively good achievements in research work, but unfortunately they were not achieved with the active support and help of the scientists concerned, but were made in the struggle with them, or were forced to be made without telling these scientists. Please see, the facts are so ruthlessly refuting the conservatives in science, and we must resolutely support young scientists in this regard.

    Among scientific workers, the practice of being polite to each other and not being able to conduct academic criticism for scientific truth also hinders the development of scientific undertakings. This is more serious in the natural sciences than in the philosophy and social sciences. Because natural science is more specialized, it is even more necessary for specialized scholars to conduct mutual criticism. Not doing so is an irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause.

    All the above-mentioned bourgeois ideas and work styles of scientific workers have a corrosive effect on young people. Some scientific workers even consciously spread these bourgeois ideas and work styles to young people, and even openly advocate bourgeois personal fame and fortune among young people, and select and promote cadres based on the anti-socialist principle of "only specialized and not red."

    Only by solving ideological problems thoroughly in the rectification movement can scientific undertakings leap forward

    It can be seen that the rectification movement in the scientific community is a key issue for the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings. We must solve ideological problems thoroughly in this rectification movement in order to enable China's scientific undertakings to leap forward. The deeper the ideological problems are dug and the more thoroughly they are solved, the more guaranteed the development of China's scientific undertakings will be. Experience has proved that it is an effective method to overcome the bourgeois ideas of scientific workers and promote the advanced ideas of scientific workers by starting with checking work on the basis of big-character posters, launching a movement to oppose waste, oppose conservatism, compare with the advanced, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    It must be pointed out that the ideological struggle between the two roads of scientific work that we want to solve in this rectification movement belongs to the category of contradictions among the people. It is different in nature from the struggle between the enemy and ourselves between us and the rightists last year regarding the two roads of scientific work, and should never be confused with them. The bourgeois rightists are launching a rampant attack on the Party and the socialist system. However, within our people, there are still many scientific workers who, although they politically support the socialist system and support the leadership of the Party, have not or are still not very willing to abandon the bourgeois worldview, thinking methods, and academic viewpoints due to their class background, due to long-term capitalist education and the influence of the capitalist work environment, and in fact have formed two roads in scientific work. In this way, the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in scientific work is inevitable. This struggle must be carried out to the end, and only when proletarian ideology completely defeats bourgeois ideology can it promote the Great Leap Forward in scientific work.

    In scientific work, in addition to the struggle between the two roads, there is also the struggle between the two methods of building socialism - the method of more, faster, better, and more economical results and the method of less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. This kind of struggle does not belong to the category of class struggle in nature. Taking the capitalist road is a step backward for building socialism, and of course there is no talk of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. However, in addition to solving the problem of the two roads, it is also necessary to solve the problem of the two methods. It should be pointed out that although the struggle between the two roads and the two methods belongs to different categories, it can exist simultaneously in the same person. However, for the majority of scientific workers today, thoroughly eliminating bourgeois ideology and becoming a red and expert scientist of the working class is the main and fundamental issue. Of course, this does not mean that all problems among scientists are problems of the two roads. It is simplistic and wrong to say this. The nature of any problem should be analyzed specifically from the specific facts revealed, and it can be clarified through mass debate.

    The rectification movement in the scientific community is now moving towards a climax and deepening. Tsinghua University held a scientific discussion meeting at the end of last year and conducted a great debate on the two roads of scientific research work, which achieved good results. Institutions such as the Institute of Physics and the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also launched in-depth criticism and self-criticism this year under the impetus of mass big-character poster criticism, starting with checking work, and achieved significant gains. At the meeting of directors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held last month, President Guo Moruo called on scientific workers to "go all out, aim high, achieve greater, faster, better and more economical results, be of one heart and one mind, be both red and expert, value labor, obey organization, strengthen cooperation, and realize the plan." Recently, the National Science and Technology Association and various specialized societies also issued a call to scientists across the country to actively participate in the rectification movement, give their hearts to the Party, give their knowledge to the people, and strive to be both red and expert, which has been widely responded to and has set off a movement of self-ideological transformation. During this meeting, the nationwide anti-waste and anti-conservative movement is unfolding with an overwhelming momentum. According to the news a few days ago, only nine scientific research institutions in the Shanghai area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have posted 70,000 big-character posters. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has more than 900 people and has posted 75,000 big-character posters. Now scientific workers in schools, hospitals, and research institutions in Shanghai are formulating red and expert personal plans, forming a craze. This personal plan not only expresses the determination of scientific workers to be red and expert, but by making suggestions on the personal plan, the personal plan can be better combined with the national task. Formulating a personal plan is a good way to consolidate the results of the rectification movement of scientific workers. All of this shows the consciousness and initiative of scientific workers in participating in the rectification movement. This consciousness and initiative will become a huge driving force.

    The role of the rectification movement in the scientific community in promoting the development of scientific undertakings is very far-reaching, but it is already very clear now. The Shanghai Institute of Experimental Biology is an example. In the past, the Institute of Experimental Biology set up groups based on people, and almost every senior researcher led a group, setting up a stall according to their own expertise, so the strength was scattered and there was no communication. The rectification movement opened up the minds of scientific workers, so that they accepted the suggestion of reorganizing the forces of all personnel into four groups according to four central issues, solved the problem of internal cooperation, and also solved the problem of cooperation between the research institute and the outside world. A joint research agreement was signed with the Tumor Hospital, and a joint training of cadres agreement was signed with Fudan University, helping the Department of Biology of Fudan University to establish an embryology major. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has proposed to unite all their forces with agricultural colleges across the country and agricultural extension stations across the country, and carry out work in a planned way according to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. This spirit is very good. In many other scientific institutions, there are also some cases of improvement. The rectification movement is not only of great benefit to the national scientific undertakings, but also of great benefit to the scientific workers themselves. We hope that all scientific workers can be brave in criticizing themselves in the movement, resolutely correct their mistakes, be brave in criticizing others, and not be afraid of others' criticism. Doing so can completely burn off the five airs on themselves, win personal peace of mind, and win the joy of dedicating themselves to the great socialist construction together with the people. To repeat, the people will not reduce their trust in those who are brave in criticism and self-criticism, brave in exposing mistakes, and brave in correcting mistakes. On the contrary, the people will increase their trust in them. This is a truth that our proletariat has obtained in the long-term struggle for revolutionary cause.

    The rectification movement has greatly improved the Party's leadership over scientific work

    The current rectification movement has greatly improved the Party's leadership over scientific work. This rectification movement is a fire that burns the shortcomings in leadership work. There are indeed shortcomings in the leadership of scientific undertakings. The shortcomings in this regard can be summarized as "not grasping enough, not learning enough." That is to say, in the past, we have not grasped enough in carrying out political and ideological education work for scientific workers, in the research of the direction of business work, in grasping local scientific work and scientific research work in universities, and in promoting scientific research results, and the work of inspection and supervision has not been frequent enough. At the same time, our comrades in the Party have not studied and delved into science enough. These shortcomings have been fully exposed in the movement. After several months of rectification and correction, the Party's level of leadership over scientific work has also been improved. Here, the most important issue is the mass line mentioned in the speeches of many people at this meeting. The mass line is the Party's fundamental leadership method in all work, but not everyone is clear about whether the mass line can be followed in scientific work and how to follow the mass line. Some people are frightened by the saying that "laymen cannot lead experts," believing that because scientific work has a specialized nature and is complex mental labor, the "mass line" cannot be followed, or simply believe that following the mass line in scientific work is to rely on a few experts. These ideas have been proven wrong in this movement. In scientific work, we must not only rely on the older generation of scientific workers, but also rely on young scientific workers, and also rely on other staff in scientific institutions. By relying on the masses, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and exposing the contradictions of things, we can easily make correct judgments, support what, oppose what, and truly overcome the problem of "going around science" and actively grasp business. Only by fully exposing the contradictions of things and being good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses can the comrades who did not understand business before gradually improve their scientific business level. When cooperating with scientists, find a common language and jointly promote scientific undertakings and improve the level of scientific leadership.

    Finally, I would like to talk about a few issues of strengthening organizational leadership to promote the Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings.

    The Tasks of Old Scientists and Young Scientific Workers

    1. The strength of existing scientific workers should be fully utilized. In the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings, the tasks placed before the older generation of scientific workers in our country are very heavy. The country requires them to not only engage in research work practically, but also to enthusiastically train young cadres and make achievements in both aspects. In order to complete the tasks assigned to them by the country, they must not only transform themselves ideologically and strive to be intellectuals of the working class, but also constantly improve themselves in business. Everyone has talked more about ideological transformation recently, and I have also said above. Everyone has not talked much about the issue of business training for the older generation of scientific workers, but it is actually an extremely important issue, because the development of modern science and technology is progressing rapidly. If one does not pay close attention to this development and constantly study and research diligently, even if one has a good scientific foundation, one will soon fall behind the times as time goes on.

    The older generation of scientific workers is a valuable asset of our country, but the number is ultimately small, and according to the laws of nature, they will gradually decrease or lose their ability to work. Therefore, the training of young scientific cadres must be regarded as the primary task. It should be seen that in recent years, our country has grown a group of young scientific cadres. They have made relatively rapid progress politically, and some of them already have the ability to engage in scientific research work independently. They are a force that can be relied upon. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the education, training, and use of young scientific workers, require them to strictly train themselves politically, give full play to their role in business, and give them help and support in all aspects. We must require them to study diligently and promote their further growth.

    Scientific workers in our country, whether the older generation or young cadres, have a common weakness, that is, they lack experience in production practice, and many people who study technical science are also like this. Therefore, the older generation of scientific workers has a problem of having to go to production to make up lessons. Young scientific workers should train themselves in production and labor.

    In the issue of organizing and mobilizing the scientific workforce, special attention should be paid to cultivating a large number of cadres in production. A large number of activists in technical innovation have already emerged in industrial and agricultural production. They have already shown their creative talents in the practice of the struggle for production. These people, who receive further training and have the opportunity to further study basic scientific knowledge, may become excellent scientific workers.

    A certain number of old cadres who have been tempered by a relatively long period of revolutionary struggle are already doing scientific leadership work, and the number of such cadres will be even greater in the future. They are an important part of the scientific team. The Party and the people require them to become experts who are proficient in a certain scientific knowledge. Whether in natural science or philosophy and social sciences, this is completely possible. The method is to learn while doing, as Comrade Chen Boda said at this meeting.

    Mobilize the Scientific Forces of Universities

    2. There are strong scientific forces in universities. For the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings and for the Great Leap Forward in production, the scientific forces in universities must be mobilized. There have always been some different views on the issue of scientific research in universities. I believe that teaching work and scientific research work in universities are basically consistent and should not be opposed. As a teacher in a university, of course, one should teach the course well. It is impossible to imagine that in a university, the teachers do not complete the teaching tasks well, and the research work can achieve good results. At the same time, it is also obvious that scientific research work plays a very important role in improving the quality of teaching. It is impossible to imagine that a school's scientific research work is done very poorly, but the teaching effect will be very good. The facts in many schools also prove that wherever the teaching work is good, the research work is also relatively good, and wherever the teaching work is not done well, the research work is also not done well. We should mention it from a positive aspect for both teaching and scientific research work. The weight of teaching and scientific research in a school should be specifically arranged, and it is not necessary to say abstractly which one comes first, which one comes later, which one is more important, and which one is less important. If a school has a tendency to only want to do research work and not want to do teaching work, it is of course necessary to criticize this tendency. Universities should not only undertake teaching tasks, but also undertake scientific research and production tasks. In universities, we should advocate the combination of research work with teaching and production. This is good for teaching, production, and scientific research work.

    It is beneficial to strengthen teaching, scientific research, and production for teachers in universities, researchers in scientific research institutions, and engineering and technical personnel in production enterprises to hold concurrent positions.

    Actively Carry Out Local Scientific and Technological Research Work

    3. Local scientific and technological research work must actively develop along with the Great Leap Forward in production. This is an indispensable and important aspect of local economic construction plans. The Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should grasp scientific work, and the Party committees of counties should also grasp this work. Local scientific work must closely serve the local Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. To carry out local scientific research work, we should first carry out local scientific planning according to the instructions of the central government. Some can be planned according to professional specialties, and some can be planned according to special topics. Local scientific planning should fully reflect the requirements of various places, and should also be related to the scientific planning of various central departments. Local scientific and technological research forces should be arranged uniformly by the local Party committees. The scientific institutions of various central departments in various places should vigorously support the local production undertakings and continuously transfer scientific cadres to the local areas. When carrying out local scientific work, attention must be paid to coordination in order to concentrate forces in all aspects to solve the most important problems. Coordination is required within various places, coordination is required between relevant regions, and coordination is required with relevant central departments. We must often struggle against the parochialism of doing things in our own way, which reflects capitalist free competition.

    Comrades! The overall situation is unprecedentedly favorable for China's socialist construction, and it is also unprecedentedly favorable for the development of China's scientific undertakings. Now the movement to oppose waste, oppose conservatism, compare with the advanced, and build socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results is unfolding deeply under the leadership of the Party. Many advanced things, advanced ideas, and advanced actions are emerging every day. I believe that after another period of time, more advanced figures and advanced examples will definitely appear. Scientific workers across the country, various scientific institutions across the country, and scientific organs at all levels across the country should go all out, strive for progress, compare with the advanced, and compare with the results. As long as the scientific and technological circles work hard, they will surely realize the Great Leap Forward in science and technology, and further promote the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. The possibility of realizing the twelve-year scientific and technological development long-term plan ahead of schedule is completely possible. We should ride the wind and waves and advance courageously. (The title and subheadings are added by the editor)

    科学事业必须为生产大跃进服务
    聂荣臻在科学规划委员会第五次会议上的讲话
    这次会开得很好。在大会的报告、发言和小组的讨论中，大家发表了许多很好的意见。充分反映了整风运动的精神和大跃进的劲头。这次会议对科学事业的大跃进起了促进和鼓舞的作用。大家对郭沫若院长所作的“加强中苏合作，为促进科学事业的大跃进而战斗”的报告，一致表示同意，认为学习苏联，加强中苏科学技术的合作，是发展我国科学事业的一个重要保证。对姜君辰、武衡两位副秘书长的报告和关于情报工作的方案，大家也原则上同意。对于1958年科学技术研究计划和自然科学方面和哲学社会科学方面的重点项目，会议也原则通过。会后我们将把这几个文件作些必要的修正，送请国务院批准实行。1958年是第二个五年计划的第一年。1958年的工作做得好，对于完成和超额完成第二个五年计划有重要的意义。因此1958年的计划必须认真执行，尽一切努力去完成和争取超额完成。在执行过程中可以而且应该对计划作若干补充和修正。现在我想根据会上大家的发言，就科学事业如何大跃进的问题，再说一些意见。
    目前的形势是：全民大动员，生产大跃进
    在讲这些问题之前，首先我想说一说形势。自从去年6月科学规划委员会召开第四次扩大会议以来，到现在时间相隔只有九个月。但是在这个期间全国的形势发生了极大的变化。特别是最近全民整风运动进一步深入，展开了反浪费、反保守、比先进、比多快好省地建设社会主义的运动，整个国家出现了前所未见的新气象。正像报纸上说的那样：“群众运动万马奔腾，政治局面生动活泼”。社会主义民主在我们国家得到了充分的发扬。在反浪费反保守运动中，广大的干部和群众采用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论等形式把心里要讲的话讲了出来，心里非常舒畅，烧得一切浪费保守现象，一切官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气没有地方躲藏。在运动中，已经出现了许多惊人的事迹，出现了许多平日难以达到，甚至难以想像的先进指标。在工业方面，许多厂矿企业，一再突破原定的计划指标。今年2月间全国人民代表大会第五次会议所通过的1958年经济发展计划，预定今年工业生产总值比去年增长14.6％，这已经是一个为了在十五年或者更多一点时间内在钢铁及其主要工业生产品方面赶上或超过英国的跃进的计划。现在根据全国各地区、各厂矿在大跃进中提出的先进计划，今年工业增长速度比原计划将大大增加。农业方面，原定到1967年完成的农业发展纲要，预计许多地区都可以提前在今后六年七年甚至更短的时期内完成。别的不说，单以兴修水利一项来说，今年新扩大的灌溉面积已经达到二亿一千多万亩，远远超过原定的九千二百万亩的计划，到年底还要增加，有些省份在今年或明年就可以基本水利化。现在大家都在和时间赛跑，把旧指标远远抛在后面。目前的形势真是：全民大动员，生产大跃进。现在大家都可以看得很清楚，从去年开始的整风运动，的的确确是一个非常深刻的社会主义革命运动。凡是革命运动，结果都是思想大解放，生产力大解放。1949年，我国人民赶走了帝国主义，打倒了官僚资本主义和封建主义，从国民党反动派的压迫下解放出来。在这个革命之后，虽然已经建立起强大的社会主义国营经济，但是资本主义生产资料的所有制，落后的分散的小生产仍旧束缚着社会的生产力的发展。1956年，我国人民完成了对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，在生产资料所有制方面完全得到了解放。1956年完成的革命比起1949年完成的革命，从它的社会意义来说，是更加深刻得多的。它挖掉了阶级剥削的根子。但是在1956年革命之后，资产阶级右派在政治上还没有受到致命的打击，很多人在思想上还没有同资产阶级划清界线，广大人民群众的社会主义积极性还没有充分发扬。近一年来的政治、思想战线的社会主义革命，是中国人民又一次的思想大解放，是我们国家又一次的生产力大解放。这个大解放首先就具体表现在工农业生产的大跃进上面。
    生产大跃进要求生产技术大革新
    随着生产大跃进，要求生产技术的大革新，要求用跃进的精神有步骤地以先进的生产工具来代替落后的生产工具，以先进的生产方法来代替落后的生产方法。因此，一定要把群众的社会主义积极性同技术改革结合起来。在农业发展纲要四十条当中，许多条都是技术措施。农业如此，工业就更加如此。为了实现技术上的革新，要求我们在尽可能短的时期内掌握苏联和其他国家的先进科学技术成就，并且根据我国实际情况进行创造性的研究，同时还要发扬我国科学遗产，总结群众生产经验，使得我国最急需的科学技术部门能在第三个五年计划期末接近或赶上世界的先进水平，同时要求把科学技术知识普及到广大群众中去，提高我们国家工人、农民的科学技术水平。
    发展哲学社会科学对生产大跃进来说同样是必不可少的。在研究社会主义建设的规律性，研究如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，克服资产阶级思想，提高群众社会主义觉悟方面，哲学社会科学是起着重要作用的。哲学社会科学的工作也应该随着生产的大跃进而大大发展。关于哲学社会科学如何跃进的问题，陈伯达同志已经讲了许多重要的意见，这些意见我都非常赞成。
    生产和科学发展的辩证法
    生产发展的要求推动科学的发展，科学的发展反过来又推动生产的发展。这就是生产和科学发展的辩证法。现在是生产大跃进迫切要求科学大跃进的时候。中华人民共和国成立八年多以来，特别是从党中央提出向科学进军的号召以来，我们国家的科学事业，包括自然科学和哲学社会科学两个方面，发展还是很快的，工作有了不小的成绩，也取得了一些经验，为今后科学事业的大跃进奠立了基础。但是，直到现在我国的自然资源还是不很清楚的，工农业生产中所提出的许多重要问题，还有不少没有人研究，许多重要的科学部门还非常薄弱，有的还是空白部门。我国科学事业的这种现状和当前生产大跃进的需要是很不相称的。因此，我们应该把促进我国科学事业大跃进的这个巨大而又光荣的任务担负起来。
    科学事业的根本方针
    为了实现我国科学事业的大跃进，就一定要明确科学必须为生产大跃进服务这个根本方针。科学本身不是目的，为科学而科学是一种极其错误的观点。科学是一定要为生产服务的，在今天就是要为生产大跃进服务。如果不明确这一点，我国科学事业就会迷失方向。科学事业如果脱离实践、脱离群众，就会失去巨大的动力，就会暗淡无光。
    科学技术怎样为生产大跃进服务呢？
    工农业生产的大跃进，向科学技术提出大量急待解决的重要问题。我们必须通过大量的科学研究工作，来解决这些问题，支援工农业生产的大跃进。在工农业生产大跃进中不断出现的重要研究课题都应该纳入国家计划的轨道。
    必须指出：我国至今还是一个在技术上落后的国家，不但在农业生产中使用的还是落后的手工工具，就是在工业生产中，虽然已经有了一定数量的现代化的大工业，但是小型工业和手工业，占着相当大的比重。改进比较落后的生产工具和生产方法，虽然从现代科学研究的观点看来有许多不是太复杂的，对于我国国民经济的发展却有非常重大的作用。我国科学工作者决不应该看轻这种工作，一定要对这种工作采取积极支援的态度。在这方面，科联、科普应该进行组织和推广工作。
    当然，在人类历史已经进入原子能时代和征服自然界的新纪元的今天，我们必须积极地在最新的科学技术方面取得迅速的发展，把我国的科学技术和生产力提到更高的水平，不断地向前跃进。因此，必须集中一定的力量来发展这些科学技术部门。对于和国家长远建设有密切关系的理论性和探索性工作，应该给予足够的重视。
    最根本的问题是科学队伍问题。必须批判某些科学工作者的资产阶级思想作风
    为了争取我国科学事业的大跃进，最根本的问题是科学队伍问题。几年来，我国科学工作者在党的领导下，积极工作，做出了不少的成绩，在政治思想觉悟方面也不断进步，特别是经过反右派和整风运动，社会主义觉悟更大大提高了。这一点是应该首先肯定的。但是，从科学研究机构和高等学校在整风中揭露的情况看来，某些科学工作者的资产阶级思想意识和作风，给我国科学事业的发展带来的损害是不小的。不进行整风，不批判这些资产阶级的思想意识和作风，科学工作要实现跃进是不可能的。
    我们订出了发展科学事业的规划，要求科学研究为国家的社会主义建设事业服务。但由于某些科学工作者把个人名利地位，个人兴趣摆在国家需要前面，按计划进行科学研究的精神就贯彻不下去。有些人，表面上也好像执行国家计划，好像在走社会主义的道路，实际上仍旧是资本主义那一套，不愿接受国家交给的研究任务，不愿研究联系实际的重大科学问题。
    科学协调工作的重要是大家都承认的。但是由于资产阶级个人主义作祟，有些科学工作者极端本位，骄傲自大，互相看不起，因而不能互相帮助，通力合作，甚至互相排挤，互相打击，妨碍协调工作的进行。还有些科学工作者还存在着极为严重的知识私有的思想，不肯把科学技术贡献给人民。把稀有的或者比较新的资料垄断起来，不肯同别人交流经验。
    看不起劳动群众在发展科学中的创造作用的这种资产阶级观点，在科学工作者中间也是比较普遍的。在工农业生产、医疗等实践中，群众有许多重要的发明创造，科学工作者有义务来学习和从科学上进行总结。在哲学社会科学方面，总结群众在阶级斗争中，在生产斗争中创造出来的经验的重要性，更是不容忽视。而现在不少哲学社会科学工作者还严重地存在着不联系群众，不接触实际的偏向，这是必须纠正的。
    在运动中，还揭露出有些科学工作者在业务上保守落后的现象，而造成保守落后的原因，往往主要是他们不肯刻苦钻研、勤奋学习，许多人得到一定的社会地位以后，就长期不求进取，暮气沉沉，死守过去的老一套，不但不再亲自动手作研究工作，连新的文献也不阅读。甚至有些人自己在学术上已经落后，然而不但不警觉起来，急起直追，反而有意无意地拒绝正确的意见，抑制青年力量的生长，硬要青年们照他的已经过时的老方法工作，对科学事业的前进起着挡路的作用。在整风运动中揭露出不少这样的例子：有些青年们在研究工作中做出了比较好的成绩，但是可惜不是在有关的科学家积极支持和帮助下取得的，而是在同他们作斗争，或是被迫瞒着这些科学家的情况下作出的。请看，事实是这样无情来驳倒了科学上的保守派，我们在这一点上要坚决支持青年科学家。
    在科学工作者之间，那种相互客气，不能为科学真理展开学术批评的作风，对科学事业的发展也起着妨碍的作用。这在自然科学方面比在哲学社会科学方面更为严重。由于自然科学比较专门，就更需要专门的学者来进行互相批评。不这样做是一种对人民事业不负责任的态度。
    所有上面列举的科学工作者的资产阶级思想和作风，对青年发生了腐蚀的作用。还有一些科学工作者，更是有意识地对青年传播这种资产阶级思想和作风，甚至公开地在青年人中提倡资产阶级的个人名利，并且根据反社会主义的“只专不红”的原则来挑选和提拔干部。
    在整风中把思想问题解决得深透，才能使科学事业向前跃进
    由此可见，科学界的整风运动是科学事业大跃进的一个关键问题。我们一定要在这次整风运动中把思想问题解决得深透，才能使我国科学事业向前跃进。思想问题挖的越深，解决得越透，我国科学事业的发展就越有保证。经验证明，在大字报的基础上，从检查工作着手，展开反浪费、反保守、比先进、比多快好省地建设社会主义的运动，来克服科学工作者的资产阶级思想，发扬科学工作者的先进思想，是行之有效的方法。
    必须指出：我们在这次整风运动中所要解决的科学工作的两条道路的思想斗争问题，是属于人民内部矛盾的范畴。它同去年我们和右派之间关于科学工作两条道路的敌我斗争，性质是不同的，决不应该把它们混为一谈，资产阶级右派是向党和社会主义制度进行猖狂的进攻。但是，在我们人民内部，也还有许多科学工作者，他们尽管在政治上拥护社会主义制度，拥护党的领导，但在科学工作中却由于阶级出身，由于长期的资本主义教育和资本主义的工作环境的影响，仍然没有或者还不大愿意抛弃资产阶级的人生观、思想方法和学术观点，实际在科学工作方面就形成了两条道路。这样，在科学工作中无产阶级和资产阶级的思想斗争是不可避免的。这一斗争必须进行到底，无产阶级思想彻底战胜资产阶级思想，才能促进科学工作的大跃进。
    科学工作中除了两条道路的斗争以外，还有建设社会主义的两种方法——多快好省的方法同少慢差费的方法之间的斗争。这种斗争按其性质来说不属于阶级斗争的范畴。走资本主义道路，对建设社会主义来说是开倒车，当然谈不到什么多快好省地建设社会主义。但是，除了解决两条道路的问题，还需要解决两种方法的问题。应当指出，两条道路和两种方法的斗争虽然属于不同的范畴，但是在同一个人身上可以同时存在。不过对于今天大多数科学工作者来说，彻底清除资产阶级思想，使自己成为又红又专的工人阶级的科学家是主要的、根本的问题。当然，这并不是说，科学家中的一切问题都是两条道路的问题，这样说是简单化的，错误的。对于任何一个问题的性质，都应当从揭露出来的具体事实中去作具体分析，通过群众的辩论，才能辨明。
    现在科学界的整风运动正在走向高潮，走向深入。清华大学在去年年底举行的科学讨论会，进行了科学研究工作的两条道路的大辩论，收到很好的效果。中国科学院物理研究所和地球物理研究所等机构，也在今年在群众的大字报批评的推动下，从检查工作入手，展开了深入的批评和自我批评，得到了重大的收获。在上月召开的科学院所长会议上，郭沫若院长对科学工作者提出“鼓足干劲，多快好省，一心一德，又红又专，重视劳动，服从组织，加强合作，实现规划”的号召。最近，中国科学院上海地区的十七位科学家提出了决心做左派，争取五年内又红又专，更红更专的倡议，得到了广泛的响应，掀起了一个自我思想改造的运动。就在这次会议期间，全国科联及各专门学会也向全国科学家发出了积极参加整风运动，把心交给党、把知识交给人民争取又红又专的号召。这几天全国反浪费反保守运动正以排山倒海的声势在开展，中国科学院上海地区只有九个科学研究机构，根据前几天的消息已经贴了七万张大字报。中国农业科学院有九百多人，已经贴出七万五千张大字报。现在上海的学校、医院、研究机构的科学工作者制订又红又专个人规划形成了热潮。这种个人规划不但表示科学工作者红专的决心，而通过对个人规划提意见，可以使个人规划同国家任务更好的结合。制定个人规划是把科学工作者整风运动的成果巩固起来的一个很好的方法。这一切都表现出科学工作者参加整风运动的自觉性和主动性。这种自觉性和主动性，将成为巨大的动力。
    科学界的整风运动对发展科学事业的推进作用，是非常深远的，但是就是现在已经可以看得很清楚。上海实验生物研究所就是一个例子。过去实验生物研究所因人设组，差不多每个高级研究人员都领导一个组，按自己的专长各摆一个摊子，因此力量分散，互不通气。整风运动打通了科学工作者的思想，使他们接受了把全体人员按照四个中心问题重新组织力量分为四个组的建议，解决了内部协作的问题，同时也解决了研究所同外面协作的问题，同肿瘤医院签订了共同研究的协议，并且同复旦大学签订了共同培养干部的协议，帮助复旦生物系建立胚胎专业。中国农业科学院已提出建议，要把他们的全部力量，和全国农业院校、和全国农业推广站大联合起来，按照农业生产大跃进的需要，有计划地进行工作。这个精神是很好的。在其它许多科学机构，也有些改进的事例。整风运动不仅对于国家科学事业有极大的好处，它对于科学工作者本人同样也有极大的好处。我们希望所有的科学工作者能够在运动中，勇于批评自己，坚决地改正自己的错误，勇于批评别人，并且毫不畏惧别人的批评。这样做可以彻底烧掉自己身上的五气，赢得个人心情舒畅，赢得同人民一道献身于伟大的社会主义建设的欢乐。重复一句，勇于批评与自我批评，勇于揭发错误，勇于改正错误的人，人民不会降低对他的信任，相反的，人民将增加对他的信任，这是我们无产阶级在干革命事业的长期斗争中所得出的一个真理。
    整风运动大大改善了党对科学工作的领导
    当前的整风运动大大改善了党对科学工作的领导。这个整风运动是烧领导工作中的缺点的一把烈火。在科学事业的领导工作中，不是没有缺点的。这方面的缺点，概括起来讲就是“抓得不够，学得不够”。这就是说，过去我们在对科学工作者进行政治思想教育工作方面，在对业务工作方向的研究方面，在抓地方科学工作和高等学校科学研究工作方面，在推广科学研究成果方面都抓得不够紧，检查督促的工作也不够经常。同时我们党的工作同志，向科学方面的学习钻研更是不够。在运动中这些缺点已经被充分地揭发出来。经过几个月来的边整边改，党对科学工作的领导水平也有所提高。在这里一个最重要的问题，就是这次大会上许多人发言中所提到的群众路线的问题。群众路线是党在一切工作中的根本领导方法，但是在科学工作中究竟能不能走群众路线，如何走群众路线，却不是所有的人都弄清楚的。有一些人被“外行不能领导内行”的说法吓唬住了，认为由于科学工作带有专门的性质，是复杂的脑力劳动，不能走“群众路线”，或者简单地认为在科学工作中走群众路线就是依靠少数专家。这些想法在这次运动中被证明是不对的。在科学工作中我们不但要依靠老一辈的科学工作者，而且要依靠青年科学工作者，还要依靠科学机构中的其他工作人员。依靠群众，开展批评和自我批评，把事物的矛盾揭露出来，我们就容易作出正确的判断，支持什么、反对什么，就可以真正克服“绕开科学走”的毛病，积极地把业务抓起来。也只有使事物的矛盾充分揭露出来，并且善于集中群众的智慧，原先不懂业务的工作同志就可以逐渐提高科学业务水平。在同科学家合作时互相找着共同语言，共同来推进科学事业并提高科学的领导水平。
    最后我想谈谈加强组织领导工作来促进我国科学事业大跃进的几个问题。
    老科学家和青年科学工作者的任务
    一、应该充分发挥现有科学工作者的力量。在科学事业大跃进中，摆在我国老一辈的科学工作者面前的任务是很重大的。国家要求他们既要切实从事研究工作，又要热心培养青年干部，在两方面都作出成绩。为了完成国家交给他们的任务，他们既要在思想上改造自己，努力争取做一个工人阶级的知识分子，又要在业务上不断提高自己。关于思想改造问题，最近大家讲得比较多，上面我也已经说过了。关于老一辈科学工作者的业务进修问题，大家讲得不很多，其实也是一个极其重要的问题，因为现代科学技术的发展是一日千里，如果不密切地注视着这个发展，不断刻苦学习和研究，一个人即使原有科学的基础较好，随着时间的前进，是很快会落在时代后面的。
    老一辈科学工作者是我们国家宝贵的财产，但是人数终究很少，而且按照自然规律，会逐渐减少或者丧失劳动能力。因此必须把对青年科学干部的培养当作首要的任务。应该看到，近几年来我们国家已经成长了一批青年科学干部，他们在政治上进步得比较快，在业务上，有一些人也已经有独立从事科学研究工作的能力。他们是一个可以依靠的力量。因此我们一定要十分重视青年科学工作者的教育培养和使用，在政治上要求他们严格地锻炼自己，在业务上尽量发挥他们的作用，在各方面给以帮助和支持，要求他们刻苦钻研，促进他们进一步成长。
    我国科学工作者，不论老一辈的或是年青干部，有一个带普遍性的弱点，那就是缺乏生产实践的经验，即使研究技术科学的人，有不少也是如此。因此老一辈的科学工作者有一个要到生产中去补课的问题。年青的科学工作者，更应该在生产中、在劳动中锻炼自己。
    在组织和动员科学工作队伍这个问题上，应该特别注意在生产中大量培养干部，现在在工农业生产中已经涌现出了大批技术革新的积极分子。他们已经在生产斗争的实践中表明了自己的创造才能。这些人得到进一步的培养，得到进一步学习基础科学知识的机会，就可能成为优秀的科学工作者。
    现在已经有一定数量的、有比较长时期革命斗争锻炼的老干部在做科学领导工作，将来这样的干部数量还会更多。他们是科学队伍中的一个重要组成部分。党和人民要求他们使自己成为通晓某一门科学知识的专家。不论自然科学方面或是哲学社会科学方面，这都是完全可以做到的，办法就是陈伯达同志在这个会议上所说的边干边学。
    把高等学校的科学力量动员起来
    二、在高等学校中拥有强大的科学力量。为了科学事业的大跃进，为了生产的大跃进，一定要把高等学校中的科学力量动员起来。关于高等学校科学研究问题，一直有些不同的看法，我认为在高等学校中教学工作和科学研究工作基本上是一致的，不应该把它们对立起来。作为一个高等学校的教师当然应该把课教好，不能设想在一个高等学校里，教师们教学任务完成得不好，而研究工作可以得到很好的成绩。同时也很明显，科学研究工作对于提高教学质量起着非常重要的作用，不能设想一个学校科学研究工作做得很糟，而教学效果反而会很出色。许多学校的事实也证明，凡是教学工作好的地方，研究工作也比较好，教学工作做得不好的地方，研究工作做得也不好。不论对教学或者科学研究工作，我们都应该从积极方面去提。关于在一个学校里教学和科学研究的分量，应该具体安排，不必抽象地说那一个在先，那一个在后，那一个重，那一个轻。一个学校如果发生了只愿作研究工作，不愿作教学工作的偏向时，对这种偏向进行批评当然是必要的。高等学校不但要担负教学任务，同样还要担负科学研究和生产的任务。在高等学校中，我们应该提倡研究工作与教学、生产相结合。这样不论对教学、生产和科学研究工作都有好处。
    高等学校的教师，科学研究机构的研究人员和生产企业的工程技术人员，互相兼职，是对于加强教学、科学研究和生产都有好处的。
    积极开展地方的科学技术研究工作
    三、地方科学技术研究工作必须跟着生产大跃进积极开展起来，这是地方经济建设计划中不可缺少的一个重要方面。各省、市、自治区党委应抓科学工作，各县的党委也应抓这一工作。地方科学工作必须密切为当地的工农业生产大跃进服务。开展地方科学研究工作，应按照中央指示，先把地方科学规划搞起来，有些可按专业规划，有些可按专题规划，地方科学规划应该充分反映各地的要求，也应该与中央各部门的科学规划相联系。地方科学技术研究力量，应由各地党委统一安排，中央各部门在各地方的科学机构，应大力支援地方的生产事业，并且不断地向地方输送科学干部。开展地方科学工作时，必须注意协调，以便集中各方面力量，解决最主要的问题。各地内部要协调，有关的地区间要协调，和中央有关部门也要协调。要经常与反映资本主义自由竞争的各搞一套的本位主义现象作斗争。
    同志们！整个形势对我国社会主义建设空前有利，对我国科学事业的发展也空前有利。现在反浪费，反保守，比先进，比多快好省地建设社会主义的运动正在党的领导下深入展开，每天都出现许多先进事物、先进思想、先进行动。我相信，再过一个时期，一定可以出现更多的先进人物，先进事例。全国科学工作者、全国各种科学机构和全国各级科学事业的机关，应该鼓足干劲，力争上游，比先进，比成绩。只要科学界和技术界努力奋斗，一定能实现科学技术的大跃进，并进一步促进工农业生产的大跃进，十二年科学技术发展远景规划提前实现的可能是完全存在的。我们应当乘风破浪，奋勇前进。（标题和小插题是编者加的）
