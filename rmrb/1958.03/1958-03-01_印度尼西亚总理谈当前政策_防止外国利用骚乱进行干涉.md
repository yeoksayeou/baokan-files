Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 28th: Indonesian Cabinet Prime Minister Djuanda stated at a parliamentary session on February 28th that the steps taken by those who organized the so-called "Revolutionary Government" in Padang not only constitute violations of national law but also betray the declaration of independence. Nevertheless, the government will adhere to its policy statement, avoiding the use of force as much as possible, even if it has to take firm action.

He said that the Indonesian government is using diplomatic channels to weaken or eliminate the influence abroad of Sjafruddin, the premier of the so-called "Revolutionary Government" in Padang. He said that the government has successfully prevented interference from any party on the West Irian issue. However, any possible foreign interference could be triggered by the unrest in Padang, Central Sumatra, which could become a stepping stone for foreign interference, as Padang is already busy seeking foreign support.

The Indonesian Prime Minister said this during a second reading debate in Parliament on the issue of striving to recover West Irian, when answering questions. Regarding the difficulties currently encountered, it can be said that most of these difficulties are not caused by the government's West Irian policy. He said that the greater difficulties are caused by the opposition outside the Indonesian Parliament, who disregard the West Irian issue and demand the absolute realization of their plans.

Djuanda said the government regrets that the Dutch would greatly exploit Indonesia's internal disputes.

Speaking of the economic measures taken in the movement to liberate West Irian, Djuanda said his government is fully confident that the measures taken so far have cleared the way for establishing a better foundation for a national economy that meets the aspirations of the Indonesian nation.

Djuanda said that since achieving independence is meant to bring prosperity and welfare to the people, the economic measures currently taken against Dutch interests are unavoidable and were bound to be taken sooner or later. He said that some of the effects of taking over Dutch enterprises can be gradually eliminated, and according to plan, the situation may return to normal within a few months.

    印度尼西亚总理谈当前政策
    防止外国利用骚乱进行干涉
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚内阁总理朱安达2月28日在国会会议上说，那些在巴东组织所谓“革命政府”的人所采取的步骤，不仅构成违反国法的行为，而且背叛了独立宣言。尽管如此，政府仍将遵守它的政策声明，尽可能地避免使用武力，即令它不得不坚决地采取行动。
    他说，印度尼西亚政府正在通过外交途径削弱或消除巴东的所谓“革命政府”的总理沙弗鲁丁在国外的影响。他说，政府在西伊里安问题上已经顺利地阻止了任何方面的干涉，但是，任何可能的外国干涉会因中苏门答腊巴东的骚乱而引起，这次骚动可能成为外国干涉的踏脚石，因为巴东已经在忙于要求外国的支持。
    这位印度尼西亚总理在国会就争取收复西伊里安问题举行二读辩论答辩时说，关于目前所遭遇到的困难，可以说，这些困难大部分都不是政府的西伊里安政策引起的。他说，造成更大的困难的是印度尼西亚国会以外的反对派，这些人把西伊里安问题置于不顾，要求绝对实现他们的计划。
    朱安达说，政府感到遗憾的是，荷兰人会大大利用印度尼西亚的内部纠纷。
    朱安达在谈到争取解放西伊里安运动中在经济方面所采取的行动时说，他的政府完全相信，迄今为止所采取的办法，已经为确立一个符合于印度尼西亚民族雄心的国民经济的更好基础扫清了道路。
    朱安达说，由于取得独立是要人民得到繁荣和福利，目前在经济方面所采取的反对荷兰利益的措施是不可避免的，这种措施是迟早要采取的。他说，接管荷兰企业的工作所产生的一些影响可以逐渐消除，根据计划，情况可能在几个月内恢复正常。
