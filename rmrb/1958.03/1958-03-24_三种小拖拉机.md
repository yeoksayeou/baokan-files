    Three Types of Small Tractors
    "May First" Brand Tractor
    The Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory recently trial-produced ten "May First" Brand 1105-type hand tractors and conducted field tests for various purposes, with good results.
    This tractor has 7.5 to 10 horsepower and weighs only 450 kilograms. It can plow dry land when equipped with a dry land plow, and can plow paddy fields when equipped with a paddy field plow. It can also drive water pumps for irrigation, saw wood when equipped with a circular saw, and can transport objects weighing 1,000 kilograms; it can also generate electricity.
    It Costs Only 40-50 Cents to Plow an Acre
    On March 12, the Xinhui Farm Implement Machinery Factory in Guangdong Province successfully trial-produced a small, versatile tractor.
    This tractor has five horsepower of traction, uses gasoline as fuel (which can be improved to use kerosene, charcoal, or biogas), is driven by one person, and has a minimum driving speed of 3.6 kilometers per hour, which can be increased to 17 kilometers. The entire machine weighs 170 kilograms and has a load capacity of 800 kilograms. According to preliminary tests, this tractor can plow 1.5 acres per hour when dragging a single-furrow plow (which can be improved to drag a double-furrow plow), with a plowing width of seven inches and a depth of six inches. In addition to plowing, paddy field harrowing, irrigation, and transportation, this tractor can also be used for mowing, logging, rice milling, sawing wood, applying medicine, and other fixed power operations. The price of this tractor is only a little over 1,000 yuan per unit, and the plowing cost per acre is only about 40 cents. (Lin Yingfa)
    Suitable for Mountainous and Sloping Fields
    The Yuncheng Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province successfully trial-produced a four-horsepower small tractor.
    This tractor is lightweight, flexible, and easy to operate. It is suitable for both plain cultivation and mountainous sloping fields. It can perform plowing, soil crushing, sowing, harvesting, fertilizing, and spraying, and can also transport materials. After preliminary tests, this small tractor can plow 1.6 to 2 acres per hour, with a plowing depth of 18 centimeters. Its load capacity is approximately 600 to 700 kilograms, and its travel speed is 5 kilometers per hour. It can also be used for grinding flour, chopping grass, ginning cotton, applying fertilizer, and pumping water. (Li Xuegong) (With picture)

    三种小拖拉机
    “五一”牌拖拉机
    国营南昌柴油机厂最近试制了命名为“五一”牌一一○五型手扶拖拉机十台，进行了田间多种用途的试验，效果良好。
    这种拖拉机有七点五到十马力，重量只有四百五十公斤，装上旱地犁即可耕旱地，装上水田犁可耕水田，又可带动水泵抽水，装上圆锯即可伐木，并能拖运一千公斤重的东西；还可以发电。
    耕一亩地只四五角钱
    广东省新会农具机械厂于3月12日试制成功了一台小型万能拖拉机。
    这台拖拉机有五个牵引马力，用汽油（改进后可用煤油、木炭或沼气）做燃料，由一个人驾驶，每小时行车速度最低三公里六，加快可达十七公里。全台机一百七十公斤重，载重八百公斤。根据初步试验，这台拖拉机拖拉一个单铧犁（改进后可拖双铧犁）耕作，耕作幅度为七寸，深度六寸，一小时能耕一亩五分地。这种拖拉机除可用于耕地、水田耙犁、抽水、运输外，还可以用来割草、采伐、辗米、锯木、撒播药剂和其他动力定置作业等。这种拖拉机每台售价只需一千多元，每亩地的耕作费用只要四角左右。　（林英发）
    山地坡田都可用
    山西省运城机械厂试制四马力小型拖拉机成功。
    这种拖拉机轻便灵活、容易操作，既适用于平川耕作，又适用于山地坡田。犁地、碎土、播种、收割、施肥、喷药都能作，而且可以运送物资。这种小型拖拉机经过初步试验，每小时可耕地一亩六分到二亩，耕深十八公分。它的载重量约六百至七百公斤，每小时行速为五公里。还可以用来磨面、铡草、轧花、施肥、抽水等。　（李学恭）（附图片）
