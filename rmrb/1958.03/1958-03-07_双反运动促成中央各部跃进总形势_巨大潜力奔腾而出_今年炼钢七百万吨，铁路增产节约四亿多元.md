Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The central state organs have unearthed enormous potential for production and construction in the movement against waste and conservatism. The situation shows that thoroughly carrying out this movement will certainly accelerate China's socialist construction and have a significant impact on the economy.

Since the Spring Festival, the central state organs have formed a general mobilization, and most organs have launched a vigorous upsurge of airing views within a few days. As of March 3, over 2.43 million big-character posters had been posted in the central state organs, Communist Youth League members had organized 947 shock brigades against waste, and various organs had held more than 560 various anti-waste exhibitions and convened many airing views seminars, airing views appraisal meetings, and airing views on-site observation meetings. Now, these advanced units are simply caught in a sea of big-character posters, and waste phenomena and conservative thinking are being besieged from all sides.

All the big-character posters and airing views seminars that exposed waste phenomena and conservative thinking guided people to tap enormous potential. The masses pointed out that if waste phenomena and conservative thinking were overcome, and bureaucratic work styles were overcome, what a tremendous material force would be generated. The Ministry of Railways proposed a plan to increase production and save another 450 million yuan for the country this year. In addition to striving to accelerate the construction of new railways, the plan is to reduce the average cost per kilometer of new railway construction from 566,000 yuan during the First Five-Year Plan to 400,000 yuan. In this way, 2.5 billion yuan can be saved during the Second Five-Year Plan. It is also planned to increase the freight volume in 1958 from 310 million tons to 330 million tons. The Ministry of Chemical Industry seized the finalized design of nitrogen fertilizer and sulfuric acid plants to launch in-depth debates, and it is estimated that it can save the country approximately 700 million yuan in funds during the Second Five-Year Plan. The Ministry of Food can save the country approximately more than 300 million yuan in 1958. The Ministry of Light Industry expects that in the next five years, the state's investment in salt will remain unchanged or increase slightly, and the construction scale can be increased from the original 8 million tons to 16 million tons; the sugar output can be increased from the original 2.1 million tons to 4 to 5 million tons.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry was impacted by 160,000 big-character posters. As of the morning of the 5th, the leaders of the ministry had considered that the national metallurgical industry could increase steel production by 760,000 tons, reaching the task of producing 7 million tons of steel this year; at the same time, it was believed that an additional 230 million yuan in profits could be turned over to the state this year.

When these huge numbers were unearthed, people felt truly comfortable and everyone was invigorated. Everyone believed that if this movement were thoroughly carried out, it could achieve "less money spent, fewer people needed, more things done," thereby greatly accelerating the speed of national construction.

Through the movement against waste and conservatism, a general situation of leap forward has been formed, and it has also prompted all links to establish new balanced relationships. For example, the construction upsurge has now arrived in various places, and the iron and steel industry departments immediately feel strained and must strive for a new balance to adapt to the needs of construction. The Ministry of Coal Industry recently put forward the slogan of striving to achieve "three, five, eight," that is, by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, strive to reach an annual coal output of 300 million tons in China, 500 million tons by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, and 800 million tons by the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. After this slogan was put forward, the relevant departments need to consider how to adapt to this situation and cooperate accordingly in their work.

At present, the development of the movement against waste and conservatism in the central state organs is still unbalanced, and some units have been slower and poorer in airing views. For example, units such as the Ministry of Supervision and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission have been slow to act and have lagged behind in the movement. Although the Academy of Sciences had carried out mobilization, the leadership did not initially conduct in-depth and specific leadership. After the Party Committee of the Central State Organs inspected the Academy of Sciences, the situation in this organ has changed. As of the 3rd, more than 20,000 big-character posters had been posted, more than 500 forums had been held, and 30 small-scale anti-waste exhibitions had been held. Many of the problems exposed confirmed that this scientific organ also had much waste and conservatism to oppose.

Currently, the Party Committee of the Central State Organs is paying attention to urging units that are slow to move to seize the opportunity and catch up. Experience has proven that while grasping the advanced link, it is also necessary to grasp the backward link, otherwise, it will not be possible to effectively drive the overall situation, and it may even make the advanced lose the meaning of universal promotion and fail to achieve a new balance.

### 双反运动促成中央各部跃进总形势  巨大潜力奔腾而出  今年炼钢七百万吨，铁路增产节约四亿多元

    双反运动促成中央各部跃进总形势
    巨大潜力奔腾而出
    今年炼钢七百万吨，铁路增产节约四亿多元
    据新华社6日讯　中央国家机关在反浪费反保守运动中，已经挖掘出巨大的生产建设潜力。情况表明，彻底开展这个运动，肯定地将加速我国的社会主义建设，在经济上产生重大的影响。
    从春节以来，中央国家机关形成总动员，几天之内大多数机关都掀起了轰轰烈烈的鸣放热潮。到3月3日统计，中央国家机关内共贴出了二百四十三万多张大字报，共青团员组织了九百四十七个反浪费突击队，另外各机关还举办了五百六十多个形形色色的反浪费展览会，召开了很多鸣放座谈会、鸣放评比会以及鸣放现场观摩会。现在，这些先进单位简直陷入了大字报的火海之中，浪费现象和保守思想受到了四面八方的围击。
    所有揭发浪费现象和保守思想的大字报和鸣放座谈会，都指引着人们去挖掘巨大的潜力。群众指出，如果克服了浪费现象和保守思想，克服了官僚主义作风，将产生出多么巨大的物质力量。铁道部提出了今年再为国家增产节约四亿五千万元的计划。除了力争加快新建铁路建设速度外，计划把新建铁路平均每公里的造价，由第一个五年计划期间的五十六万六千元，降低到四十万元。这样在第二个五年计划期间内，就可节约二十五亿元。还计划把1958年的货运量由三亿一千万吨增加到三亿三千万吨。化工部抓住氮肥和硫酸等厂的定型设计展开了深入的辩论，在第二个五年计划内，预计可以为国家节约大约七亿元的资金。粮食部在1958年大约可以为国家节约三亿多元。轻工业部预计今后五年国家对盐的投资不变或增加少量投资，建设规模可以由原定八百万吨提高到一千六百万吨；糖的产量可以由原定二百一十万吨提高到四、五百万吨。
    冶金工业部受到十六万张大字报的冲击。到5日上午，这个部的领导上已认为全国冶金工业可以增产七十六万吨钢，达到今年生产七百万吨钢的任务；同时认为今年可以再增加二亿三千万元的上缴利润。
    当这些巨大的数字被发掘出来以后，人们真是心情舒畅，人人振奋。大家认为，把这个运动彻底搞透，就可以做到“钱可少化，人可大减，事可多办”，因而大大地加快国家建设的速度。
    通过反浪费反保守运动，形成了跃进的总形势，并且促使各个环节必须建立新的平衡关系。例如，目前各地建设高潮已经到来，钢铁工业部门立即感到吃紧，必须力求新的平衡，适应建设的需要。煤炭工业部最近提出了争取实现“三、五、八”的口号，即是在第二个五年计划末，争取我国煤的年产量达到三亿吨，第三个五年计划末达到五亿吨，第四个五年计划末达到八亿吨。这个口号提出以后，有关的部门就需要考虑如何适应这种形势，在工作上相应地配合。
    现在，中央国家机关的反浪费反保守运动发展还不平衡，有一些单位鸣放得比较慢、比较差。例如监察部、体育运动委员会等单位，行动迟缓，运动落后了一步。科学院虽然进行过动员，但领导上开始并没有深入具体领导，经中央国家机关党委对科学院进行检查以后，这个机关的情况已经有了改变，到3日为止，已经贴出了两万多张大字报，举行了五百多次座谈会，举办了三十个小型反浪费展览会，揭发出的很多问题，证实了这个科学机关也大有浪费和保守可反。
    目前，中央国家机关党委正注意督促运动迟缓的单位抓紧时机，迎头赶上。经验证明，抓紧先进一环的同时还必须抓紧落后的一环，否则便不能有力地带动全盘，甚至有可能使先进失去普遍推广的意义，无法达到新的平衡。（附图片）
