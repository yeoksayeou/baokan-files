Wei Chengyou was originally the Propaganda Committee Member of the Chahua District Committee of the Fuyang County of the Chinese Communist Party. Last spring, he was sent down to the Xinhe Agricultural Cooperative in Ranmiao Township. This cooperative was located in a low-lying area and often suffered from internal waterlogging disasters, resulting in very unstable agricultural harvests. Wei Chengyou often thought about how to eliminate waterlogging and ensure increased production. Whenever he had free time, he would carry a manure basket, collecting manure while surveying the terrain in the fields to find solutions. One day, in Hamawa, he met an old farmer in his eighties and shared his concerns with him. The old cooperative member told him, "If we build a dike on the Han River and a dam at the Xu River Estuary, Xinhe Cooperative will be able to harvest grain even if the sky falls." When large-scale water conservancy projects were undertaken this year, Wei Chengyou brought up this suggestion. The cooperative committee accepted this idea and started building the dike around the clock. In ten days, a 14-li-long dike was built along the Han River. However, building the dam proved difficult. According to calculations, this dam would be 12 meters long and 9 meters wide, requiring 40,000 jin of cement, 90,000 pieces of quartzite, and 80 cubic meters of sand and gravel. Purchasing these materials would cost 16,000 yuan.

Wei Chengyou pondered day and night about how to save materials and money while still building a good dam. One day, he went to the Dongzhai Production Team and saw that Dong Zhenbang's wall was built with "shajiang" (a type of concretionary sandstone). This inspired him to build the dam with "shajiang." Because most of the cooperative's farmland, when dug slightly down, had large and small pieces of "shajiang," using it to build the dam would save materials and money. However, when he raised this idea at the cooperative cadre meeting, many people disagreed, with some even saying, "If you can build a dam out of 'shajiang,' I'll say the sun rises in the west." Wei Chengyou was not discouraged. He carried a manure basket to the Xuzhuang Production Team and found mason Xu Yuncai to conduct experiments together at the Xu River Estuary. They used manure shovels to chop three different types of "shajiang," and only one type produced sparks when chopped. He then confirmed that the latter type was hard and could be used to build the dam. However, he was still not completely sure, so he found stonemason Dong Mingxi and brought tools to the river estuary to cut the large "shajiang" into square shapes and then found mud workers to build a test section. After more than 20 experiments, it was finally confirmed that "shajiang" could indeed be used to build the dam. The cooperative accepted Wei Chengyou's suggestion and decided to build the dam with "shajiang." After cleaning the dam foundation, the cooperative members sorted the "shajiang" taken from the fields in layers, used large "shajiang" to build arches, and filled the gaps with small "shajiang" and yellow clay. In this way, a dam was built with only over 700 workdays and 52 yuan. The cooperative members named this "shajiang" dam "Wannian Dam" (Ten-Thousand-Year Dam). (Xinhua News Agency Special)

### 魏成友用砂礓建成万年闸

    魏成友用砂礓建成万年闸
    魏成友原是中共阜阳县插花区委会宣传委员，去年春天下放到冉庙乡新河农业社。这个社地势低洼，常受内涝灾害，农业收成很不稳定。魏成友时常考虑怎样消除内涝、保证增产的问题。他一有空就背着粪筐边拾粪边在地里踏看地形，寻找办法。有一天，他在蛤蟆洼里遇到了一位八十多岁的老农，他把心事告诉了他。老社员对他说：“要是在汉河打道圩，徐河口造座闸，就是塌了天，新河社也能收粮食。”今年大修水利时，魏成友就把这意见提了出来。社委会接受了这一意见，连夜开工圈圩，十天功夫就沿汉河筑起了一道长十四里的圩堤。谁知建闸的时候发生了困难。据计算，这座闸有十二公尺长、九公尺宽，需要水泥四万斤、碛石九万块、砂子和石子八十方，购买这些材料就需一万六千元。
    魏成友日夜思索如何省料省钱又能把水闸建好。一天，他到董砦生产队，看到董振邦家的墙是用砂礓垒的，这件事引起了他用砂礓建闸的想法。因为这个社的大部分耕地稍为往下一挖，就有大块小块的砂礓，利用它来建闸正可以省料省钱。可是，当他把这一想法在社干部会上提出来的时候，很多人都不同意，有的人还说“砂礓修成闸，我叫太阳从西边出来”。魏成友并不灰心，他背着粪筐到徐庄生产队找泥水匠徐云彩一同到徐河口去试验。他们用拾粪铲子砍了三种不同的砂礓，只有一种用铲砍上火星直冒。于是他就肯定后一种质地坚硬，可以用来建闸。但是，他还不放心，于是又找着石匠董明修带着工具到河口把大砂礓断成四角四楞的形状，再找泥水工人砌着作试验。经过二十多次的试验，最后肯定砂礓完全可以建闸。社里接受了魏成友的意见决定用砂礓造闸。清理闸基以后，社员们就把地里取来的砂礓分层整理，把大砂礓砌拱，小砂礓泥和黄胶泥填空。这样，只花七百多个劳动日和五十二元就建好了一座水闸。社员们把这座砂礓闸命名为“万年闸”。　（新华社专稿）
