    In the "double-anti" movement in institutions of higher education, some professors and scientists have already begun to engage in face-to-face criticism and self-criticism, breaking the past atmosphere of complacency, where everyone swept the snow from their own doorstep and ignored the frost on others' roofs, where opinions were not voiced and ideas were not exchanged. Some professors and scientists are facing each other, pouring out their hearts, and beginning to treat others' criticisms with a sincere and humble attitude. This is a very good phenomenon.

    However, there are still people who dare not speak their minds. They always feel that criticizing others is too inconsiderate of their feelings, and that it will be difficult to get along in the future. Some people reluctantly put up a few big-character posters and made some suggestions, but they still dare not speak out on the most fundamental and serious issues, only skimming the surface. Some people, upon seeing big-character posters criticizing them, or hearing criticisms of themselves, blush and feel that someone is trying to ruin their "face" and "prestige" of many years, and "make a fool of them" in front of the masses. Supported by this kind of emotion, they cannot face their own shortcomings and errors squarely, and treat the criticism of the masses with arrogance and even resistance. Therefore, they cannot calmly examine their shortcomings.

    The situation is pressing. To achieve an ideological leap forward, self-transformation is necessary. Criticism and self-criticism are powerful weapons for self-transformation. Only by using this weapon can we more profoundly expose ideological problems and help each other to carry out ideological reform. Those who fear criticism and self-criticism either use old eyes to view criticism and self-criticism, and therefore feel they have lost their "face" or embarrassed others; or they understand the principles but are just not used to it emotionally, always feeling that something is not quite right. They have not seen how great the harm of their own or others' erroneous ideas is to the country and society! We should not haggle over so-called personal face or personal habits, but should quickly cast those things aside. Let the fierce flames of the "double-anti" movement fiercely burn these bourgeois individualist ideas.

    Some people say that if they have shortcomings, they can just correct them themselves, why should the masses put up big-character posters? If ideological reform were really that easy, then it would be fine to just reflect behind closed doors. Many facts have proven that to truly reform one's thinking, in addition to one's own determination and subjective efforts, one must rely on the strength and supervision of the masses; secretly changing is impossible. Since contradictions and errors exist, they should be exposed. Through criticism and self-criticism, expose contradictions and errors, so that correctness can defeat error, the new can defeat the old, and the advanced can defeat the backward. Our professors and scientists, since they want to transform themselves into red and expert "red experts," must have this kind of heroic spirit, daring to set fire to themselves, and letting the raging fire burn away all their bourgeois ideas.

    思想见面，相互交心
    柏生
    高等学校在双反运动中，有些教授和科学家已开始面对面地开展了批评与自我批评，打破了过去“各人自扫门前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜”的一团和气、有意见不提、思想不见面的情况。有些教授和科学家面对面，互相把心交出来，并且开始以诚恳虚心的态度对待别人的批评。这是个十分好的现象。
    但是，也还有人迄今还不敢谈心里话。他们总觉得批评人，似乎太不顾别人的面子，将来大家不好相处。有的人勉强贴了几张大字报，提了一些意见，但是还不敢说出最根本最严重的问题，只是蜻蜓点水似地一掠而过。有些人一看到批评自己的大字报，或听到批评自己的意见，就面红心跳，觉得这是有人要把自己多年来的“面子”和“威望”搞垮，在群众面前“丢他的丑”。在这种情绪支持下，他们不能正视自己的缺点和错误，对待群众的批评有傲慢甚至抗拒的态度。因此，不能冷静地检查自己的缺点。
    形势逼人。要思想大跃进，就要自我改造。批评与自我批评是自我改造的有力武器。运用这个武器，才能比较深刻地揭发思想问题，彼此帮助进行思想改造。那些害怕批评与自我批评的人，有的是用旧眼光来看待批评与自我批评，因此觉得丢了自己的“面子”或扫了别人的“面子”；有的人也懂得了道理，但就是感情上不习惯，总觉得这样作有些什么不对头似的。他们没有看到自己或别人的错误思想，对国家对社会的危害性是多么大！不要斤斤计较所谓个人面子，个人习惯，应当迅速把那些东西抛开。让双反运动的猛烈火焰狠狠地焚烧这些资产阶级个人主义思想。
    有人说，自己有缺点自己改就是了，何必要群众贴大字报。如果思想改造真正这样容易，那就闭门思过好了。许多事实证明：要真正改造自己的思想，除了自己要有决心，作主观努力外，必须依靠群众的力量和群众的监督，偷偷地改是不可能的。矛盾和错误既然存在，就应该揭露。通过批评与自我批评把矛盾和错误揭露出来，让正确战胜错误，新战胜旧，先进战胜落后。我们的教授和科学家，既然要把自己变成红透专深的红色专家，就要有这样一种豪迈精神，敢于引火烧身，让熊熊的烈火烧尽自己一切资产阶级思想。
