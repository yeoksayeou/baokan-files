Xinhua News Agency, Liaoyang, 27th. Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, is organizing large-scale cooperation between farmers in the plains and mountainous areas to jointly realize a three-year construction plan to transform the mountainous areas.

The first batch of vanguard teams, composed of 1,000 young men and women voluntarily from Xiaoji, Shaling and other townships in the plains, went to Liming Cooperative in Gujiazi Township, a deep mountainous area, on March 20. In four days, the terraced fields, check dams, and fish-scale pits they built exceeded more than half of the original quota. The second and third batches, a massive army of 20,000 people supporting the construction of mountainous areas, will successively head to the mountainous areas at the end of March and the beginning of April, launching a 25-day general offensive towards the high mountains and steep ridges.

47% of Liaoyang County is mountainous. Many high mountains and steep ridges have suffered from severe soil erosion due to years of disrepair. The grain yield per unit area in most mountainous areas is very low, only 1,000 to 2,000 jin per hectare. In order to build the poor and backward mountainous areas into prosperous mountainous areas, the Liaoyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after formulating a three-year construction plan to change the face of the mountainous areas, decided to organize 50,000 to 60,000 people from the plains this year to support the construction of the mountainous areas and help the mountainous areas overcome the difficulty of insufficient manpower. The county party committee's decision was warmly responded to by the farmers in the plains. Xiaoliqi Township originally planned to send 320 workers, but after rationally arranging the work of the commune itself, it actually sent more than 400 people. The farmers in this township said that in the past when floods occurred in the plains along the river, the farmers in the mountainous areas were always the first to climb mountains and wade through rivers to help us overcome the floods. Today we will never forget this deep friendship.

    彻底改变辽阳山区面貌
    平原农民支援山区
    据新华社辽阳27日电　辽宁省辽阳县组织平原和山区农民之间大协作，齐心合力实现三年改造山区的建设计划。
    第一批由平原区小祁、沙岭等乡自愿组成的先遣队一千名男女青年，3月20日去深山区孤家子乡黎明社，四天内修的梯田、谷坊、鱼鳞坑就超过原订定额一半多。第二批，第三批拥有两万人的支援山区建设大军，将在3月底和4月初陆续开赴山区，向高山峻岭展开二十五天的总进攻。
    辽阳县有47％的地方是山区。许多高山峻岭由于多年失修，水土流失十分严重。多数山区的粮食单位面积产量很低，每公顷只有一两千斤。为了把穷困落后的山区建设成富裕的山区，中共辽阳县委在订出三年改变山区面貌的建设规划以后，决定今年内从平原地区组织五万到六万人去支援山区建设，帮助山区克服人力不足的困难。县委的决定，得到了平原区农民的热烈响应。小立祁乡原来计划出工三百二十人，后来经过合理安排本社活计，实际出了四百多人。这个乡的农民说，历年平原沿河区发生洪水灾害的时候，山区农民总是首当其冲爬山涉水来帮助我们战胜洪水，今天我们也绝不会忘记这种深情厚意。
