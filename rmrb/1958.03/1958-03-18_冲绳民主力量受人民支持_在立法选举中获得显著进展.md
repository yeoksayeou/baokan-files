Xinhua News Agency, Naha, March 17th: The Okinawa Island, under U.S. military occupation, held legislative elections on March 16th. According to unofficial results tallied today, the "Council for Liaison in Support of Democracy" (abbreviated as "Minren"), composed of Okinawa's democratic and patriotic forces, made significant progress in this election. Five of their candidates were elected, increasing their seats by three compared to the previous session. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party, which supports U.S. rule, suffered a setback in the election, with its seats decreasing from seventeen in the previous session to seven. The Social Mass Party and independents won nine and eight seats respectively. The campaign slogans put forward by "Minren" in this election included: resolutely opposing the transformation of Okinawa Island into a base for atomic and hydrogen bombs; the immediate return of Okinawa to Japan, opposing the long-term and expanded requisition of land by the U.S. military, and safeguarding and improving the lives of the Okinawan people.

At the same time, the United States has taken various measures to undermine the election campaign of the Okinawa democratic forces and ease the anti-American sentiment of the voters. The United States recently removed Moore, the U.S. High Commissioner to Okinawa, who had actively implemented the policy of turning Okinawa Island into a military base, in an attempt to ease the anti-American sentiment of the Okinawan people. On the other hand, the United States also colluded with the Japanese government to try to prevent the Japanese people from supporting the election campaign of the Okinawa democratic forces.

    冲绳民主力量受人民支持
    在立法选举中获得显著进展
    据新华社17日讯　那霸消息：美军占领下的冲绳岛在3月16日举行了立法院选举。据今天开票的非正式结果，由冲绳民主爱国力量组成的“拥护民主主义联络协议会”（简称“民联”），在这次选举中获得显著进展，有五位候选人当选，比原有的议席增加了三席。同时，支持美国统治的民主党在选举中失败，获得的议席从上届的十七席减为七席。社会大众党和无党派人士在选举中分别获得了九席和八席。“民联”在这次选举中提出的竞选口号包括：坚决反对把冲绳岛变成原子弹和氢弹基地；冲绳立刻归还日本，反对美军长期和扩大征用土地，维护和改善冲绳人民生活等。
    同时，美国采取多方面的手段来破坏冲绳民主力量的竞选活动和缓和选民的反美情绪。美国不久以前解除了积极执行使冲绳岛军事基地化政策的美国驻冲绳岛高级专员穆尔的职务，以缓和冲绳人民的反美情绪。另一方面，美国还勾结日本政府竭力阻挠日本人民支援冲绳民主力量进行竞选活动。
