    A 138-year-old man, Liu Zhen, from Liujia’ao Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, has been leading his family of forty in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, earning warm praise from the local masses.
    Not long ago, when Liujia’ao Village launched the patriotic health campaign, the elderly Liu Zhen was extremely happy. He called his entire family together and said to them: "I have lived for over a hundred years, and this is the first time I have heard of the government mobilizing the people to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. I suffered in the past, and the reason I could live to such an old age is because I loved to work and loved cleanliness. Now in the new society, everyone is blessed, and with the addition of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, everyone can live to be as old as I am. I myself want to live a few more years."
    Under the mobilization of the elderly Liu Zhen, this large family of forty, both young and old, got to work and cleaned the interior and exterior of their home thoroughly. They also formulated a plan to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, aiming to clean up 1,380 dan of accumulated fertilizer and for each person to catch forty rats and sparrows before Liu Zhen's birthday on March 20th.

    138岁老人带领全家除四害
    山西省壶关县刘家凹村一个一百三十八岁的老人刘桢率领全家四十口人除四害、讲卫生，受到了当地群众的热烈称赞。
    不久以前，当刘家凹村开展爱国卫生运动时，刘桢老人高兴极了，他把全家人叫到一起，对他们说：“我活了一百多岁，这是第一次听说政府发动人民除四害、讲卫生。我过去受苦受罪，能活到这么大年纪，就是爱劳动、爱干净的原故。如今在新社会是人人有福气，再加上除四害、讲卫生，就人人能活到我这样大的年纪，我自己也还要再多活几年。”
    这个四十口的大家庭，在刘桢老人的发动下，全家大小动手，已把室内室外整理得干干净净，还订出了一个除四害、讲卫生的计划，要在3月20日刘桢寿辰前，全家清扫积肥一千三百八十担，每人捉老鼠和麻雀四十只。　　（新华社）
