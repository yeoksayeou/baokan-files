Encourage the Masses to Think Boldly

Several centuries ago, people hoped to fly freely in the sky like birds. When airplanes were invented, this beautiful hope became a reality. Now, cadres of the Dongsizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, seeing tap water, turned above-ground canals into an underground irrigation network, resulting in the seven major benefits of "three savings, three conveniences, and one prevention." From this, it can be seen that all reasonable hopes, through human effort, will eventually become reality.

The task of leadership lies in encouraging the masses to think boldly and act boldly. Many cadres recognize the power of the masses; however, they do not do enough to promote the wisdom of the masses and let them think boldly. It should be known that the masses daring to think boldly is the starting point for developing their wisdom and strength.

    鼓励群众大胆地想
    若干世纪以前，人们曾经希望过能像鸟儿般地在天空自由飞翔。当飞机发明以后，这个美丽的希望就变成了现实。现在，偃师县东寺庄农业社的干部看到了自来水，于是就把地上渠道变成了地下水道灌溉网，结果得到了“三省、三便、一防止”的七大好处。由此可见，一切合理的希望，经过人的努力终久是会变成现实的。
    领导的任务，就在于鼓励群众大胆地想，大胆地做。许多干部对于群众的力量是有认识的；但是，对于发扬群众的智慧，让群众大胆地想，却做得不够。要知道，群众敢于大胆地想，正是发挥群众智慧和力量的起点。
