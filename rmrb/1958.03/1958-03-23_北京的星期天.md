    Beijing's Sunday
    Jiang Cheng (poem), Miao Di (illustrations)
    Speaking of Sundays in Beijing, let's not talk about theaters and parks. Walk around inside and outside the city, and you'll never stop seeing new people and new things.
    Early in the morning, before the shops open, the sound of newspaper vendors comes from the street. Why is the sound so crisp? Because they are all Young Pioneers.
    In the open space, people come and go, men and women, old and young, busy planting trees, wanting to give the capital a green coat and then add a floral dress.
    Red flags flutter at Princess Tomb, bicycle racers show their skills, speeding by in a flash, only the wheels are visible, not the people.
    Outside Xuanwu Gate, beside the river, school flags flutter, reflecting the blue sky. Today, they wield shovels to widen the river course, and in the future, they aspire to change mountains and rivers.
    Generals and soldiers come in formation, take off their military uniforms and carry soil, working hard to eliminate depressions, forgetting to drink water and eat.
    Carrying shovels and pots to dig up pupae, eliminating enemies beside toilets and houses, getting rid of pests as early as possible, achieving a "four-no" city early on.
    Under the Lugou Bridge, it is drizzling, young people encourage each other to catch field mice, regardless of wet clothes and cold weather, smashing all mouse holes before going back.
    Sunday is full of fresh things, today I will only talk about these seven things. No one wants to rest, spending the day in battle and labor. (Attached image)

    北京的星期天
    江城诗  苗地画说起北京星期天，不谈戏院和公园，城里城外走一走，新人新事看不完。清早商店未开门，街头传来卖报声，为啥声音这样脆？原来都是红领巾。空地上人来人往，男女老少种树忙，要给首都披绿袄，再加一件花衣裳。红旗飘展公主坟，自行车手赛本领，风驰电掣转眼过，只见车轮不见人。宣武门外护河边，校旗飞舞映蓝天，今日挥锹宽河道，他年立志改山川。将军兵士列队来，脱下军衣把土担，消灭洼地干劲大，忘了喝水和吃饭。扛锹提罐去挖蛹，厕旁宅边歼敌人，除害要尽还趁早，早早实现四无城。芦沟桥下蒙蒙雨，青年鼓劲捉田鼠，管它衣湿与天寒，捣尽鼠穴再回去。星期天事事新鲜，如今只说这七件。谁也不愿去休息，战斗劳动度一天。（附图片）
