Huaibei Strives to Achieve Water Network Transformation Ahead of Schedule
		Boats Connected, Water Integrated, Over 20 Million Mu of Dry Land Will Become Paddy Fields

    This report (by our staff) - The Huaibei area of ​​Anhui Province can fully realize water network transformation within three years. With the realization of the water network, grain output will also reach the 500-jin target within three years ahead of schedule, two years earlier than the original five-year plan. This is the conclusion reached by a responsible comrade of Anhui Province recently during an inspection in Huaibei, based on the enthusiasm and progress of the masses in building water conservancy projects, and through research with cadres and the masses. He told reporters that the Huaibei water network transformation has higher requirements than general water conservancy projects. After the Huaibei water network is transformed, rivers, ditches, and ponds will form a network, densely covering the entire Huaibei area. Not only will it eliminate flood disasters and provide irrigation for dry land, but it will also achieve interconnected ditches and rivers, connected ditches and ponds, and boat access to all townships and small boat basins access to all communes. In this way, the eighteen counties of Huaibei will become an area where boats are connected and water is integrated. Approximately 25 million mu or more of cultivated land can be converted into paddy fields within three to five years (more than 6 million mu will be converted this year). After the Huaibei water network transformation, it will not only be practically the same as the Jiangnan region in terms of natural features, but also advance together with Jiangnan in production. For example, Fuyang Prefecture will achieve 500 jin per mu within three years, and after the water network transformation, it will advance to 800 jin by 1962, while Fuyang County will advance to 1,000 jin.

    Wang Zulie, chief engineer of the Huai River Commission, introduced the Huaibei water network transformation plan, saying that this plan implements the principles of relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, and emphasizing water storage. According to calculations, constructing a ditch and pond network project with 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork per square kilometer in Huaibei can form a small water network, storing all the rainwater of an average year, and at least providing water for converting one-third of the cultivated land into paddy fields. With the addition of groundwater and river-regulated water, more than half of the cultivated land can be converted into paddy fields, and all dry land can be turned into irrigated land. The original major rivers in Huaibei, such as the Ying River and the Wo River, all flow from northwest to southeast. According to the plan, a major river will be excavated from Funan, Fuyang, and Runheji in the southwest to the northeast, intersecting with the original rivers, connecting the water of all major rivers in Huaibei, and forming the major water network of Huaibei. The large and small water networks are connected to each other, forming the water network of the entire region. In this way, during floods, the large and small water networks can store water simultaneously, and drain water appropriately when necessary; normally, water storage will be carried out simultaneously to regulate the water use of all farmland in Huaibei. Even with 400 millimeters of rain in ten days, floods can still be avoided, and even without rain for seventy days, droughts can also be avoided. Dams built at the confluence of major rivers can generate electricity, and boats can travel all over Huaibei.

### 淮北争取提前实现水网化  船相通，水相济，二千多万亩旱地将变稻田

    淮北争取提前实现水网化
    船相通，水相济，二千多万亩旱地将变稻田
    本报讯　安徽省淮北地区在三年内完全可以实现水网化。随着水网化的实现，粮食产量也将提前在三年内达到五百斤指标，比原来的五年规划又提早了二年。这是安徽省的一位负责同志最近在淮北视察中，根据群众兴修水利积极性及进度，和干部、群众研究的结论。他对记者说，淮北的水网化比一般的水利化要求更高。淮北水网化后，河流、沟、塘将构成网状，密布全淮北，不但免除了涝灾，旱地都有水浇，还要达到沟河相通，沟塘相连，乡乡通船，社社通小船盆。这样，淮北十八县便成了船相通，水相济的地区，大约有二千五百万亩以上耕地可在三年到五年内改成水稻田（今年改种六百多万亩）。淮北水网化后，不但在自然面貌上实际和江南无异，在生产上也将和江南一起跃进。如阜阳专区在三年内实现每亩五百斤，水网化后到1962年便要跃进到八百斤，阜阳县则要跃进到一千斤。
    淮委王祖烈总工程师介绍淮北水网化的规划说，这个规划贯彻了依靠群众，小型为主，以蓄为主的方针。据计算，在淮北每平方公里作二十五万土方的沟塘网工程，便可构成小水网，把一般年份全年的雨水都蓄起来，至少可供三分之一的耕地改种水稻之用，加上地下水和河流调剂的水，可改种一半以上的水稻，旱地也都可变成水浇地。淮北原有的大河如颍河、涡河等十几条河流都从西北向东南流，规划中则要从西南的阜南、阜阳、润河集向东北各开挖一条大河，使和原有河流交叉相会，沟通淮北所有大河的水，成为淮北的大水网。大小水网相通相连，便成了全地区的水网。这样，水涝时，大小水网可以同时蓄水，必要时适当排水；平时并同时进行蓄水，调剂淮北所有农田用水。在十天下四百公厘雨的情况下，仍可不发生涝灾，七十天不下雨也可不发生旱灾。在大河交汇处做了闸，便可发电，并且走遍淮北都能通船。
