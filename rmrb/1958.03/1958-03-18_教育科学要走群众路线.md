Education science must keep up with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. At present, education science work is very backward. Reality has presented us with many problems. For example, in order to implement the education policy proposed by Chairman Mao, it is necessary to solve a series of problems such as the education system, curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods; another example is that the principles of running schools diligently and thriftily, combining work and study, and mass participation in running schools have been implemented in various places, which have also raised many new problems. We have not studied them and raised them to the level of theory to guide practice in turn. In order to solve these problems, education science workers must face reality. In the past few years, education science workers have generally only worked on books and sat in their studies for months and years, rarely going to the scene. Therefore, in the future, education science workers must go deep into the scene.

Education science work must be linked to the broad masses. China has more than two million teachers, and they have accumulated a wealth of experience in their actual work, which needs to be summarized and improved. The Central Committee of the CPSU once pointed out to Soviet scientists that the study of education science must summarize the experience of teachers. This principle also applies to us. As long as we take the mass line, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, refine it, and elevate it to theory, education science can make a leap forward.

Data work is also very important. The current situation is that modern and ancient Chinese educational materials have not been collected and sorted out, which makes it difficult to carry out research work. We plan to edit and publish historical education materials during the Second Five-Year Plan period, including the educational materials of the old liberated areas which are about to be published, and some ancient educational materials are also being prepared for publication. At present, some education historians have a tendency to "value the ancient and despise the present." Everyone goes to study Confucius and Xunzi, but does not pay attention to the research of Chinese education in recent decades, especially the research of Chinese education since liberation, which is not good. In addition, important works of major foreign educational and psychological schools are also planned to be translated and published.

To study philosophy and social sciences, we must master the methodology of Marxism-Leninism. If social science workers want to raise the rich materials they have mastered to the level of rational knowledge through abstract thinking, they must use the methodology of Marxism-Leninism as a weapon to analyze and synthesize them. The biggest difference between our social science workers and the so-called scientists of the bourgeoisie is that we have mastered the invincible weapon of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, education science workers should seize the opportunity of the rectification campaign to strengthen ideological transformation. Without solving this problem, a leap forward is impossible. Of course, various bourgeois pedagogies that hinder our progress must also be seriously criticized. There can be no establishment without destruction.

At present, the ranks of education science workers are very weak. If we want to complete the education science plan, we must organize the national research forces and quickly establish a core organization to lead the national education science workers. We urgently hope that education administrative departments will pay attention to the theoretical research work of this industry and speed up the training of theoretical teams in this industry. First of all, we hope that the veteran cadres in the education department will carry out scientific research with the spirit of learning while doing, and eliminate the erroneous ideas of neglecting theory in this department. The natural science institutions in Shanghai have organized some cadres, engineers, and teachers with research capabilities to jointly study some topics, which is a very good collective research method. We should also adopt this method to organize professors, full-time researchers, education administrative cadres, and some outstanding primary and secondary school teachers to conduct scientific research.

### 教育科学要走群众路线

    教育科学要走群众路线
    戴白韬
    工农业生产正在大跃进，教育科学工作必须跟上去。目前，教育科学工作是很落后的。现实向我们提出了许多问题。例如，为了贯彻执行主席所提出的教育方针，就必须解决学制、课程、教材、教法等一系列的问题；又例如勤俭办学、勤工俭学、群众办学等办学方针已在各地展开，也提出了许多新问题，我们都没有把它们加以研究，提高到理论上来反转来去指导实践。为了解决这些问题，教育科学工作者必须面向实际。几年来，教育科学工作者一般都只是在书本上下工夫，成年累月地坐在书斋里，而很少到现场去。因此，今后教育科学工作者必须深入现场。
    教育科学工作必须联系广大群众。我国有二百多万教师，他们在实际工作中积累了许多丰富的经验，这些经验是需要加以总结提高的。苏共中央曾经对苏联科学工作者指出过，研究教育科学必须总结教师经验。这个原则对我们同样适用。只要走群众路线，把群众的智慧集中起来，加以提炼，使它上升为理论，教育科学就可以跃进。
    资料工作也很重要。现在的情况是，我国现代的和古代的教育资料都还没有加以搜集和整理，这就很难进行研究工作。我们准备在第二个五年计划时期内，编辑出版教育史资料，其中老解放区的教育资料即将出版，古代教育资料也准备出版一些。现在，有些教育史家有“厚古薄今”的倾向，大家都去研究孔子、荀子，而不重视近几十年来中国教育的研究，特别是解放以来我国教育的研究，这就不好。此外，外国主要教育学派和心理学派的重要著作，也准备翻译出版。
    研究哲学社会科学，必须掌握马克思列宁主义的方法论。社会科学工作者如要把所掌握的丰富资料，经过抽象的思惟，提高到理性知识的水平，那就必须用马克思列宁主义的方法论为武器来加以分析综合。而我们的社会科学工作者同资产阶级的所谓科学家最大的区别，就在于我们掌握了马克思列宁主义这个战无不胜的武器。因此，教育科学工作者应抓紧整风的机会，加强思想改造。如不解决这个问题，跃进是不可能的。当然，各种妨碍我们前进的资产阶级教育学也必须认真地予以批判，不破就不能立。
    目前，教育科学工作者的队伍十分薄弱。如要完成教育科学规划，就要把全国的研究力量组织起来，并且要迅速把领导全国教育科学工作者的核心组织建立起来。我们迫切希望教育行政部门重视本行业的理论研究工作，加紧培养本行业的理论队伍。首先希望教育部门中的老干部抱着边干边学的精神来开展科学研究工作，消除本部门轻视理论的错误思想。上海的自然科学机构，把一些有研究能力的机关干部、工程师和教师组织起来，使他们共同研究一些专题，这是一个很好的集体研究的办法。我们也要采用这个办法，组织教授、专职研究人员、教育行政干部和一些中小学优秀教师进行科学研究。
