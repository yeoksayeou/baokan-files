Editorial Notes:

    Wishing a Bountiful Harvest of Literary and Artistic Production
    The Chinese Writers Association has issued a call to writers across the country, urging everyone to be all-seeing and all-hearing, to work on multiple fronts, to whip the horses and speed up production, to write more, write faster, write well, and write vividly and concisely.
    Beijing's writers have enthusiastically responded to this call, and writers across the country, including amateur writers, will certainly agree with this approach. As long as everyone goes all out, is full of vigor, and creates and innovates boldly, a high tide of literary creation will inevitably arrive.
    The literary and art circles, after last year's great debate, have swept away the poisonous gas of the bourgeoisie, and the productive forces have been liberated. Of course, the old ideological style cannot be completely eliminated all at once, and continued efforts are needed, but the broad proletarian literary and artistic road has been opened up, and writers can wield long spears and short clubs, gallop freely, and fully display their talents.

    祝文艺生产大丰收
    中国作家协会向全国作家发出了一封号召信，要求大家眼观六路，耳听八方，双管齐下，快马加鞭，多写，快写，写的好，写的生动精炼。
    北京的作家们热烈响应了这个号召，全国的文学家包括业余作家在内，也一定会赞成这样做。只要大家全力以赴，精神抖擞，大胆创造，大胆革新，文学创作的高潮必然会到来。
    文艺界经过去年的大辩论，扫荡了资产阶级的毒气，生产力已经获得了解放。旧的思想作风当然不可能一下子彻底清除，还要继续努力，但是宽阔的无产阶级的文艺道路已经开辟，作家们可以舞长枪，耍短棒，纵横驰骋，大施身手了。
