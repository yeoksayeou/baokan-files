    "Longevity and Eternal Spring"
    Cao Di
    "Longevity and eternal spring" is a line from the mnemonic verses for the thirteen postures of Tai Chi Chuan. Although it is a mnemonic verse, it truthfully expresses the benefits of Tai Chi Chuan for physical health.
    Every morning, as you enter Zhongshan Park, among the cypress trees, under the wisteria trellises, in front of Zhongshan Hall, you will always see people practicing Tai Chi Chuan. The group in front of Zhongshan Hall comes even more regularly. They arrive as soon as the park opens every morning. They are all elderly people over fifty years old. Some of them are weak, and some even suffer from chronic diseases. Because they practice Tai Chi Chuan regularly, the weak become strong, and the sick get better. Yu Wanfu, an elderly man of seventy-three, contracted "cold legs" when he was young. As he got older, he found it difficult to squat down, his legs ached at night, and he was in pain all over, making it difficult to sleep. When he was sixty-nine, he had difficulty walking and couldn't move without a cane. Later, he started practicing Tai Chi Chuan. After practicing for a period of time, he ate more, slept better. More than two years later, his waist and legs became flexible, his cold legs were cured, and he no longer needed a cane. Now, look at Yu Wanfu. Although his beard is inches long and white, his body is dark and sturdy; although he has not returned to his youth, he is "unaware of how much younger" he feels.
    When Yu Wanfu talked about the benefits of practicing Tai Chi Chuan, he said: "Tai Chi Chuan can indeed prolong life and promote longevity. If I hadn't practiced Tai Chi Chuan, I would probably have been bedridden by now." (Attached picture)

    “延年益寿不老春”

    “延年益寿不老春”，这是太极拳十三势的歌诀中的一句。虽然是歌诀，但它却如实地道出了太极拳对身体健康的好处。
    每天清晨，你走进了中山公园，在柏树林中，紫藤架下，中山堂前，总会看到一些人在练太极拳。中山堂前的那一伙人，来得更经常。每天早晨一开公园门就都到了。他们都是五十岁以上的老人。他们有的体弱，有的还患有慢性病。因为经常练太极拳，弱的变强，病的转好。七十三岁的老人于万富，年轻时候得了寒腿症；年纪大了，两腿蹲下都感到困难，晚上腿疼，混身疼痛，觉都睡不好。他到六十九岁那年，走路都困难了，行动不离拐杖。后来他练起太极拳，练了一个时期，饭吃得多了，觉睡得好了。两年多后，腰腿也灵活了，寒腿症也好了，拐杖也不拄了。现在你看看于万富，他虽白须盈寸，但身体黝黑结实；虽然不是返老还童，但也是“不知年轻几许”。
    于万富老人在谈到练太极拳的好处时说：“太极拳确实能延年益寿，我要不是练太极拳，现在恐怕早已躺下了。”（附图片）
