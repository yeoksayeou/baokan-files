Strive to Realize a Great Leap Forward in Scientific Development
Guo Moruo

Break the Atomic Nucleus of Our Scientific Community

Everyone understands that an unprecedented upsurge is currently forming in industrial and agricultural production throughout the country. Chairman Mao likened the thorough liberation of the people's power and the people's productivity to the great energy produced by breaking an atomic nucleus, even greater than that energy. The result of breaking through an atomic nucleus will cause a chain reaction, with the energy from the broken nucleus going on to break other atomic nuclei. Our country is now undergoing a huge change with such a chain reaction. All aspects and departments of the country have been mobilized. The atomic nucleus of our scientific community must also be broken through, causing a chain reaction. Therefore, in today's context, the question regarding a great leap forward in scientific development is not whether it should happen or whether it can happen, but rather what methods should be adopted to achieve the great leap forward, and how our scientists should summon their energy, strive for the top, and complete their tasks.

The slogan of a great leap forward in scientific development was actually put forward as early as two years ago, but the way it was proposed and the words used were different. In 1956, the Party Central Committee convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals, calling for a great march towards science and giving scientists and technicians major tasks to bring important and urgently needed scientific fields close to or up to advanced world levels within twelve years. This is the great leap forward in science. To catch up with advanced world levels in a relatively short period of twelve years with China's relatively backward science, isn't this a leap forward? In the first half of 1956, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, hundreds of scientists were gathered to formulate a long-term plan for the development of science and technology. At the same time, long-term plans were also formulated for the development of philosophy and social sciences. As everyone knows, our guiding principle for formulating plans was "focus on key areas and catch up head-on." Doesn't "catch up head-on" mean a great leap forward? In the past, our science had fallen behind. If we started everything from scratch, it would be prolonged and we would never catch up with world levels. But today we have a solution, which is to start from the current stage of Soviet science and catch up. This is called "catching up head-on." This needs to be vigorously implemented, doesn't this mean a great leap forward? Therefore, speaking of a great leap forward in the scientific field, it is not something that is only proposed today. The question today is not whether we should or can leap forward, but how to achieve a leap forward.

We Have the Conditions for a Leap Forward

The slogans of "marching towards science," "catching up with international advanced levels in twelve years," and "catching up head-on" have been put forward for two years. Twelve years, now there are only ten years left. Let us review whether we have achieved the level of a leap forward in the past two years. It cannot be denied that our scientists have done a lot of work and achieved many results in the past two years. The units affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences have also made gains in scientific research as a result of everyone's joint efforts. However, thinking calmly, although we have achieved results, we cannot say that it is a leap forward. Even the achievements of these two years seem to be slightly inferior to those of the past on the surface. However, in 1956 and 1957, we did a lot of good preparatory work for the great leap forward in science. Therefore, it can also be said that 1956 and 1957 were two years in which we prepared for the great leap forward in scientific development.

For the sake of the leap forward, what conditions have we prepared?

First, we have formulated a long-term plan for the development of science and technology. To carry out any undertaking under the construction of socialism, it must be carried out in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner. Of course, scientific development must also have a comprehensive plan. Therefore, we concentrated the wisdom of hundreds of outstanding scientists, plus the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and we formulated a plan. This is our blueprint for the future development of scientific undertakings. This prepares good conditions for the development of Chinese science.

Second, in the two years after the draft plan was formulated, we have been gradually putting it into practice, especially the emergency measures, which are being accelerated in our Academy of Sciences and in other departments. Blank areas are being established. Weak links are also being gradually strengthened. This is the second preparation condition.

Third, the Science Planning Commission of the State Council has become a permanent institution. In the two years of 1956 and 1957, under the leadership of the Science Planning Commission, China's scientific undertakings have done a lot of coordination work, which is an indispensable condition for the great leap forward in science.

Fourth, we have strengthened the scientific ranks. To do things, there must be people, there must be cadres, and cadres determine everything. We must give full play to the potential of veteran scientists, while cultivating a large number of new forces. Taking the Academy of Sciences as an example, in the five years from 1952 to 1957, there has also been significant development in this area. In 1952, there were thirty-one directly affiliated research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. By the end of 1957, there were sixty-eight, an increase of 120%. In terms of personnel, in 1952, there were 5,239 staff members in the entire academy. In 1957, there were 17,335, an increase of 230%. In 1952, there were 1,292 researchers. In 1957, there were 5,506, an increase of 326%. How many senior researchers and technicians are there? In 1952, there were 317. In 1957, there were 746, an increase of 140%. In 1952, there were 314 assistant researchers. In 1957, there were 755, an increase of 140%. In 1952, there were 661 research interns. In 1957, there were 4,005, an increase of 506%. Whether from the perspective of research institutions or staff, there has been a significant increase in the past five years. Of course, at present, we still feel that there are not enough people, and there are very few senior personnel in each unit. We feel that we need to increase our strength. There are two ways to increase our strength: on the one hand, we must try to give full play to the potential of existing scientists; on the other hand, we must do our best to cultivate new generations. We hope that the education department will allocate some outstanding young people to participate in scientific research work; on the other hand, we must also rely on our own efforts and adopt the Soviet method to cultivate more new generations. But judging from the current situation, the number of people is indeed much larger than it was five years ago. It can be said that we have prepared the fourth necessary condition for the scientific leap forward.

Fifth, we have cleared our minds. As everyone knows, last year we carried out the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, and the rectification movement is still ongoing and must be insisted upon. The struggle against the rightists and our internal rectification have solved the problem of the two roads on the ideological front. Through the anti-rightist struggle, everyone's political and ideological awareness has been raised, and their understanding of socialism is clearer. Everyone is determined to contribute their strength to socialist construction. If we do not unify our understanding, it is impossible for science to make a great leap forward. To summon our energy, we must unify our understanding and have a common direction. If we are half-hearted and everyone has their own ideas, such energy can only cancel each other out. We must clear our minds in order to move forward in one direction. This is also a necessary condition.

Sixth, we have strengthened international cooperation. For the past eight years, our country's entire construction cause has benefited from international cooperation, first and foremost, of course, the Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance to us. The same is true in scientific research for the past eight years, but recently, Sino-Soviet cooperation has been further strengthened. As everyone knows, in mid-October 1957, the Chinese government sent a Chinese scientific and technological delegation to the Soviet Union. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Ministry of Higher Education also sent delegations to the Soviet Union for three months of negotiations. One was to listen to the Soviet Union's opinions on our long-term plan; the other was to discuss how to further strengthen the comprehensive cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in scientific and technological research. After three months of work, we thank the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences for their great help, which enabled the delegation to complete its mission. In December 1957, the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences signed a cooperation protocol. In 1958, there were as many as eighty-nine cooperation projects between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences, and 288 senior Soviet experts came to China in 1958. They came to our country in the form of academic business trips, paying their own expenses to come to China to seek advice. This truly shows that only between socialist countries can there be such genuine and selfless assistance. The Soviet Union's dispatch of so many senior scientists is very good for us. They have advanced experience, and coming to China can better integrate with China's reality. This is a good opportunity for us to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience. Therefore, the question is how we can find ways to do all the preparatory work to give full play to the role of Soviet experts. They do not stay in China for long, generally two or three months. In this short period of time, how to give full play to their strength so that we can receive more education is a question worthy of our serious consideration. When I was in the Soviet Union, Dr. Mikhailov, who came to China a few years ago to help formulate the long-term plan, told me: many experts are coming to China for short-term business trips. How to give full play to their role? He has one opinion: that is, if you want to solve any problem, first raise the problem to the expert, and provide the necessary information to the expert at least one month in advance. If you wait until the expert arrives before understanding the situation and slowly searching for information, two or three months will pass in a flash. This is a very good opinion and worthy of our adoption. Scientific and technological cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet Academies of Sciences can be said to be a leap forward in strengthening. Eighty-nine cooperation projects a year, and 288 senior scientists are coming. We must not disappoint others with such sincere and selfless assistance, and we should make good preparations. In January of this year, an agreement was signed between the Chinese and Soviet governments, and there are 122 major scientific and technological issues that China and the Soviet Union are jointly researching and that the Soviet Union is helping us research. The agricultural academies of the two countries and the higher education ministries of the two countries have also signed cooperation agreements. These steps have greatly strengthened cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Why strengthen it? In order to enable the development of China's scientific undertakings to truly "catch up head-on" with the help of the Soviet Union, and to truly realize a great leap forward in science.

Heroes Need Not Worry About Having No Place to Use Their Skills

In summary, although the achievements in scientific research in the past two years have not been so significant, and cannot be said to be a leap forward, considerable and thorough conditions have been prepared for future leaps forward. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the government, no effort has been spared in doing this work for the development of science and technology.

Of the twelve-year task, two years have been spent on preparation. But can the task be completed? Can it be achieved? Judging from the current situation, Chairman Mao told us: "The whole nation is vigorously developing, and there is great hope." It can also be seen from our meeting this time that our scientists are vigorously developing, and the scientific leap forward is also full of hope. Everyone's understanding is consistent. They all believe that a scientific leap forward is very possible. Why is there hope? This is because our preparatory work has been quite thorough; secondly, the country's need for science and technology has greatly increased, requiring the development of our science and technology to support all aspects of socialist construction. In terms of industrial production, Chairman Mao proposed that China catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years or longer. Under Chairman Mao's call, a production upsurge has been set off in industrial construction. In agriculture, the Agricultural Program originally planned to be completed in ten years, but now it can be completed in less than eight years. After the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front comes to an end soon, there will be several major measures with revolutionary significance. One revolution after another, continuous revolution, will promote our 600 million people to attach importance to science and technology. Our scientists' tasks in the future have been greatly increased, and the country's need for science has also greatly increased compared with previous years. The country's need is a need for a great leap forward, requiring scientists to strive to break through the atomic nucleus of science and technology departments and set off an upsurge in scientific and technological research. The situation is so "pressing" that in a short period of time, a high tide of scientific and technological research will inevitably be set off not only within the scientific community but also throughout the country. Today, our scientists should not worry about having no place to use their skills. In the old days, most scientists did not use what they had learned, and could not give full play to their abilities. Today, what we feel is not that heroes have no place to use their skills, but that the land has no heroes to use. In the past, we "slapped our thighs and sighed," but now I am afraid that there are too few heroes and the demand is too great, and our heroic spirit is not enough.

We Must Fight the Earth

We are now fighting the Earth, we must conquer nature, this is the business of 600 million people, not just a few scientists, we should consider the problem from this perspective. Here I have considered some immature opinions:

(1) We must hand over our hearts to the organization. Chairman Mao told us: everyone should be of one heart, two hearts, three hearts, and being half-hearted will not work. We must have a common understanding and a common direction to carry out our work. Handing over our hearts to the organization also means handing them over to each other. We should be sincere with each other, which means that our thoughts should meet. We must unify our ideological understanding and serve socialist construction honestly. If everyone is not of one heart and one mind in the same direction, the greater the enthusiasm, the greater the dispersion. Therefore, we must add this point, "everyone is of one heart." In ancient China, King Wu of Zhou defeated the world of Yin Zhou. In fact, Yin Zhou was not not a hero, he was very strong and could fight tigers, but "Zhou had hundreds of millions of people, hundreds of millions of hearts," so there was no strength. "Zhou had three thousand ministers who were of one heart." Three thousand people of one heart defeated hundreds of millions of people with hundreds of millions of hearts. We have few people, heavy tasks, and urgent time. If we are still half-hearted, the task cannot be completed. Therefore, although there are few people, as long as everyone is of one heart, the power will be great. Therefore, we must clear our minds, persist in rectification, improve our work style, and transform our thinking. Thinking can be transformed, and people can be changed. This point is of the utmost importance today. In the future, in the war against the Earth, being half-hearted is absolutely not allowed. It is difficult to complete any task without unified strength.

(2) We must conduct self-education, help each other, and explore our potential, both red and expert. To achieve this, especially the exploration of potential is very important. A person's potential power is very great. For example, when a house catches fire, the wall is very high, and you can't jump over it normally, but at this time you can jump over it all at once. When people are in danger, they can lift things that they can't lift, this is everyone's experience, that is, to take out all the strength they have. Now we want everyone to take out the strength they have. Of course, I am not saying that this is a time of crisis, but that for the common good, to promote the construction of the country, and to catch up with the British level and the international level, we should use all our strength.

(3) Embody the socialist spirit of mutual assistance, do a good job in cooperation and coordination, and eliminate individualism, departmentalism, and other bourgeois ideas. We must coordinate and cooperate well to embody the socialist spirit of collectivism. We are talking about learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union every day. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union here is that between fraternal countries and socialist countries, we should give full play to socialist mutual assistance, and give full play to the spirit of internationalism between countries. If there is a spirit of internationalism between countries, is there no inter-ministerial spirit between units and units, or inter-institute spirit between institutes? Is there no interpersonal spirit between people? There are some things in our Academy of Sciences that are almost unbelievable. There are some senior scientists who live in the same room and do not speak. This is very bad. We must embody the socialist spirit of mutual assistance, do a good job in cooperation and coordination, and eliminate individualism, departmentalism, and other bourgeois ideas.

(4) Mobilize the masses, believe in the masses, and work hard to popularize science. The masses I want to talk about are not the masses within a unit affiliated with the Academy of Sciences, nor are they the masses of the entire academy of tens of thousands of people, but the great masses of 600 million people in China. In the future, our revolutionary task is to have 600 million people participate in the war against the Earth. We must mobilize the great masses, believe in the great masses, and hand over scientific knowledge to the masses. We have been nurtured by the masses to live to this day. To be honest, our lives have been maintained by the masses to this day, and knowledge comes from the masses. Therefore, we should hand over all our knowledge to the masses, and scientists should do more popularization work. In the Soviet Union, they have a regulation: each academician must make two popular science reports every year. I don't know about the academicians in our China, but I am afraid that they have not made even one specialized report. They are high above, like the Hanlin scholars of the past. The Hanlin scholars are like camels, looking down on the masses, not approaching the masses, and thinking that doing popularization work is inferior. We should get rid of this bureaucratic air, not be Hanlin scholars, but be intellectuals of the working class. In the future, we must vigorously strengthen scientific publicity, promotion, and publishing work. We rarely see scientists' propaganda articles in newspapers. In terms of literature, it is almost blooming everywhere, and there are literary magazines everywhere, but our scientific community is very scarce, except for a little bit in terms of popularizing science and technology, there is very little else. Since we say that we want to mobilize the masses and believe in the masses, we should take the great masses of 600 million people as our object to popularize knowledge and hand over knowledge to the masses.

(5) Chairman Mao said: Knowledge comes from the masses and from practice. Chairman Mao also said: Knowledge can also come from scientists' experiments, which also comes from practice. But today we should do more work to obtain knowledge from the masses. There is a lot of good knowledge among the people, such as agricultural knowledge and medical knowledge. But our scientists are high above and disdain to take raw materials from the people and work hard to process them. We must raise the experience of the masses to the level of scientific theory, so that science can develop; at the same time, it is returned to the masses to make it more popular.

(6) We must launch a hundred schools of thought to contend. Hold more seminars and academic conferences to launch debates. Our academic atmosphere is too thin, and there are very few academic conferences. In the future, all units and all places should improve the academic atmosphere and research atmosphere in this area, and at the same time popularize it.

(7) Most research institutes have established academic committees. But after careful investigation, the academic committees of many research institutes are nominal and have not played any role or given full play to the role of the academic members. In fact, the academic members in the research institute are more important than the academician. Because they are at the forefront, they are the staff officers of the front-line company. In the future, research institutes should think of more ways to give full play to the role of the academic committee. There are many things to do, such as the formulation of a research plan for a research institute, how to cooperate with the actual situation, how to evaluate and check the results, and the long-term vision of the scientific direction. Leaders of the Academy of Sciences, leaders of the academic departments, and academicians should go to the institute to take a look in the future, even if it is just a quick glance, it would be better to get off the horse. In this way, we can closely connect with the business and contact the actual situation of the real academic leadership.

(8) Learn from each other. Didn't Chairman Mao say? Natural scientists should study social sciences, and social scientists should study natural sciences. I think especially those who are engaged in philosophy, if they do not understand emerging physics and economics, then that is the poverty of philosophy, it is the old set. Of course, natural scientists should also learn social sciences, especially Marxism-Leninism. If they do not study Marxism-Leninism, then they are white scientists, which is very dangerous.

(9) Scientists should pay attention to writing articles. This point is to understand the meaning of Chairman Mao. The Chairman wants us to learn to write good articles. Scientists should be the most able to write articles, because they have strong logic and accurate concepts. But I don't know how, many of the documents that the Academy of Sciences produces are incomprehensible. Punctuation marks are randomly placed, and it takes hundreds of words to put a period, which is very unprincipled. In fact, other countries are not like this, especially the articles of French scientists are written very beautifully. Scientists should write good articles, especially theoretical articles, and they should be written more vividly. In the future, when we want to strengthen publicity and popularization, it is important that your article should be understood by others. What the Chairman said: accurate, clear, and vivid, is to make people understand and like to read, not to make people misunderstand. Chairman Mao thinks that Lu Xun's articles are good, and his thoughts immediately exchange with the readers. This is worth our study. Some of us who are engaged in literature are twisted, like Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng. Their purpose is to make you not understand. China has such a problem, "to be profound with shallow writing," the original thought is very shallow and vulgar, he must write it very profoundly, so that you can't figure out what is profound. Chairman Mao speaks so movingly, and his articles are so clear, and the ideological content is so profound. We must be able to express profound thoughts in an easy-to-understand way, so that anyone can approach them. I suggest: science should be literary; literature should be scientific. Scientists should also learn a little literature, logic, and history. Scientists learn quickly, especially logic, which is not a principle proposed from science? As for general history, as a citizen of the People's Republic of China, you should know some. As a scientist, you should do more work on the history of scientific development in China. In China, the historical data of natural science is very rich, and it will be very helpful to everyone to sort it out. "Words without style will not go far." If the speech does not have a little literary talent, it will not spread far, and you must study the technology of article expression.

(10) Can we do a little more teaching work? In this way, the Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Education can be more closely linked. Today, cultivating new forces is the country's largest central task. The scientists' profession is to improve research, especially the Academy of Sciences, we are high-level breakthroughs, and we want to be pioneers. Of course, we have our tasks, but if we have the ability, it is very necessary to carry out some teaching work. The ancients said: "Teaching and learning promote each other." Teaching others and doing our own research complement and promote each other. Don't divide the Ministry of Education so clearly, we should try our best to adopt a cooperative attitude and do more teaching work. For example, the president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, ?Smiyanov, spends four days in the Academy of Sciences and two days at Moscow University. Many of the academicians in the Soviet Union are teaching at universities. On the other hand, to improve our scientific level, learning foreign languages is also very important. A real scientist should understand at least two foreign languages. In recent years, we have attached great importance to Russian, but we have neglected the languages of other countries. We should strengthen this in the future.

(11) We must do a good job in preparatory work and give full play to the strength of Soviet experts as much as possible. This has been said before. Soviet experts come to China to work, combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's reality, which is the best learning opportunity for us. We must seize the learning opportunity to give full play to their role.

(12) Do a good job in academic intelligence work. We should pay broad attention to domestic and foreign academic intelligence. The Soviet Union has done a very good job in this area. The scale of the Soviet Information Institute is the second largest after the Atomic Energy Institute. More than 4,000 people are working, and more than 10,000 people are contacted, which is worthy of our study.

Finally, I suggest that we use the following four-character eight-sentence phrases as our common spirit slogan for common struggle, common development of science, and leap forward science:

		Summon energy, do more, faster, better, and more economically;
		Of one heart and one mind, both red and expert;
		Attach importance to labor, obey the organization;
		Strengthen cooperation, realize the plan.

    努力实现科学发展的大跃进
    郭沫若
    打破我们科学界的原子核
    大家都了解，目前在全国范围内，工业生产农业生产正形成空前的热潮。毛主席把人民的力量、人民生产力的彻底解放比譬为原子核被打破所产生的伟大能量，甚至比那能量还要大。原子核被冲破的结果，就会引起链锁反应的现象，被冲破原子核的能量又去冲破其他的原子核。我们的国家现在正在起着链锁反应的巨大变化。国家的各个方面各个部门都已经鼓动起来了，我们科学界的原子核也不能不被冲破，发生链锁反应。所以在今天来讲，科学发展上的大跃进，不是应不应该跃进；也不是能不能够跃进的问题，而是应该采取什么方法来实现大跃进的问题，是我们科学家们怎样鼓足干劲、力争上游、完成任务的问题。
    科学发展大跃进的口号，实际上早在两年前就提出了，不过提出的方式以及采用的字眼有所不同而已。1956年党中央召开关于知识分子问题的会议，号召向科学大进军，并且给科学家、技术家以重大的任务，在十二年内使重要的急需的科学部门接近或赶上世界先进水平。这就是科学大跃进。要把中国比较落后的科学在不太长的十二年内赶上世界先进水平，这难道不是跃进吗？1956年上半年，根据党中央的指示，集中了几百位科学家，制订了发展科学技术的远景规划。同时，在发展哲学社会科学方面也同样制订了远景规划。我们制订规划的方针，正如大家所知道的，是“重点发展，迎头赶上”。所谓“迎头赶上”难道还不是大跃进吗？过去，我们的科学掉了队，如果一切都从头做起，那就旷日持久，永远赶不上世界水平。但在今天有办法了，便是在苏联科学的现阶段上出发赶上去，这就叫作“迎头赶上”。这是需要大力来实现的，这还不是大跃进吗？所以在科学范围内讲大跃进，并不是今天才提出的，在今天不是应不应跃进或者能不能跃进的问题，而是如何实现跃进的问题。
    我们有跃进的条件
    “向科学大进军”、“十二年赶上国际先进水平”、“迎头赶上”这些口号已提出来两年了。十二年，现在只剩下十年了。让我们回顾一下这两年来是否做到了跃进的程度。不能否认，两年来我们科学家做了不少工作，取得了不少成绩。中国科学院所属各单位，也由于大家共同努力的结果，在科学研究上有收获。但是，平心静气想一想，我们虽然取得了成绩，但还不能说是跃进，甚至这两年来的成绩从表面上看比起以往似乎还有些逊色。但是，在1956、1957这两年中，我们为科学大跃进却做了不少的好的准备工作。因而也可以说，1956、1957两年是我们为科学发展准备大跃进的两年。
    为了跃进，我们准备好了那些条件呢？
    第一，我们制订了发展科学技术的远景规划。在建设社会主义下办任何事业都要有规划、有组织、有步骤地进行，科学发展当然也不能不有全面的规划。所以我们集中了几百位优秀的科学家们的智慧加上苏联和其他兄弟国家的协助，我们制订了一个规划。这是我们今后发展科学事业的蓝图。这就为中国科学的发展准备了好的条件。
    第二，在规划草案制订后的两年中，我们是逐步地在实践，特别是其中的紧急措施，在我们科学院和在其他部门都在争取时间加紧实现。空白部门正在建立起来。薄弱环节也正在逐步充实。这是第二项准备条件。
    第三，国务院科学规划委员会成了常设机构。1956、1957年两年，我国科学事业在科学规划委员会的领导下做了许多协调工作，这种协调工作是为科学大跃进所不可缺少的条件。
    第四，我们加强了科学的队伍。要作事必须要有人，要有干部，干部决定一切。必须发挥老科学家的潜力，同时培养大量的新生力量。以科学院来讲，从1952年到1957年这五年里，在这方面的工作也有显著的发展。1952年中国科学院直属研究机构三十一个，到1957年底六十八个，增加了120％。人员方面，1952年全院工作人员五千二百三十九人，到1957年是一万七千三百三十五人，增加了230％。1952年研究人员是一千二百九十二人，到1957年是五千五百零六人，增加了326％。高级研究人员和技术人员有多少呢？1952年三百一十七人，1957年七百四十六人，增加了140％。助理研究员1952年三百一十四人，1957年七百五十五人，增加了140％。研究实习生1952年六百六十一人，1957年四千零五人，增加了506％。无论从研究机构、从工作人员来讲，五年来都有了显著的增加。当然，目前还是感到人手不够，每个单位的高级人员也很少，感到要增加大的力量。增加力量的办法：一方面要尽量发挥现有科学家的潜在力量；一方面要尽力培养。我们希望教育部分配些优秀的青年来参加科学研究工作；在另一方面也要自力更生，要采取苏联的办法来多多培养新的后代。但就现有情况看，比五年以前的人数确是增加得不少了。可以说为科学跃进准备了第四个必要的条件。
    第五，我们打通了思想。大家知道，去年进行了整风反右斗争，目前还在进行整风运动而且一定要坚持下去。对右派的斗争和我们内部的整风，解决了思想战线上的两条道路的问题。经过反右派斗争，大家的政治思想觉悟提高了，对社会主义认识更明确了。大家有决心要拿出自己的力量为社会主义建设服务。我们在认识上如不统一起来，科学要大跃进是不可能的。要鼓起干劲，就必须统一认识，要有共同的方向。如果是三心二意，各人有各人的心，这样的干劲，只能相互对消。一定要把思想打通，才能朝着一个方向努力前进。这也是必要的条件。
    第六，加强了国际合作。八年来，我们国家整个建设事业都得到国际合作的效益，首先当然是苏联对我们的伟大无私的援助。在科学研究上八年来也是同样，但在最近中苏合作更进一步加强了。大家知道1957年10月中旬，我国政府派出了中国访苏科学技术代表团，中国科学院、农业科学院、高等教育部也都派了代表团到苏联去进行了三个月的商谈。一是听取苏联对我们远景规划的意见；另一是商讨如何进一步加强中苏科学技术研究全面合作的问题。经过了三个月的工作，感谢苏联党中央、苏联政府、苏联科学院给我们伟大的帮助，使代表团完成了任务。1957年12月中苏两国科学院签订了合作议定书。1958年中苏两国科学院的合作项目就有八十九项之多，苏联高级专家1958年来中国的有二百八十八位。他们来我国，是采取学术出差的方式，自己出钱到中国来移樽就教。这真是表示了只有在社会主义国家之间才会有这种真正无私的帮助。苏联派出这么多的高级科学家来，对我们是很好的，他们有先进的经验，到中国来又能更好地结合中国的实际，这是我们学习苏联先进经验的很好的机会。因此，问题是我们如何想办法作好一切准备工作来发挥苏联专家的作用。他们到中国来时间不长，一般是两三个月。在这短短的时期中，如何发挥他们的力量使我们受到更多的教益，是值得我们严肃认真考虑的问题。我在苏联时，前年来中国帮助制订远景规划的米海依洛夫博士曾对我讲：许多专家要到中国来，都是短期出差，如何发挥作用，他有一个意见：就是说你要解决什么问题，先把问题向专家提出，而且把必要的资料至少在一个月以前向专家提出。假如等专家到了才了解情况，慢慢摸资料，两三个月的时间一晃就没有了。这是一个很好的意见，是值得我们采纳的。中苏两国科学院间的科学技术合作，可以说是飞跃性的加强，一年合作八十九个项目，又要来高级科学家二百八十八位。这种赤诚无私的帮助，我们千万不要辜负了别人，应该做出很好的准备。今年1月，中苏两国政府之间的协定已经签订了，中苏共同研究、苏联帮助我们研究的主要科学技术问题有一百二十二项。两国农业科学院、两国高等教育部之间也同样签订了合作协议。这些步骤大大加强了中苏两国之间的合作，为什么要加强呢？为了使中国科学事业的发展在苏联帮助下，真正做到“迎头赶上”，真正实现科学的大跃进。
    英雄不愁无用武之地
    综上所述，两年来在科学研究成绩上虽不是那么显著，说不上跃进，可是为了今后的跃进准备了相当周到的条件。这两年，为了科学技术的发展，在党中央和政府的领导下，曾不遗余力地做了这些工作。
    十二年的任务，为了准备工作就花去了两年。但任务是不是能完成，能不能达到呢？在今天的形势下看来，毛主席告诉我们：“全民族发扬蹈厉，大有希望”。在我们这一次会上也可以看出来，我们科学家发扬蹈厉，科学跃进也一样大有希望。大家的认识是一致的。都认为科学跃进很有可能。为什么有希望？这就是我们的准备工作做得相当周到；再就是目前国家对科学技术的需要大大增加了，需要我们科学技术发展来支援社会主义建设的各个方面。工业生产方面，毛主席提出，在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量上，在十五年或者更长一点时间内赶上或者超过英国。在毛主席的号召下，工业建设方面都卷起了生产热潮。在农业方面，农业纲要原来预订十年完成，现在要不了八年就能完成。不久在政治思想战线上的社会主义革命告一段落后，接下去还会有若干带有革命意义的重大措施。一个革命接着一个革命，不断地革命，推动我们六万万人都对科学技术加以重视。我们科学家今后的任务是大大加重了，国家对科学的需要也比前几年大大增加了。国家的需要，是一个大跃进的需要，要求科学家努力冲破科学技术部门的原子核，卷起对科学技术研究的高潮。形势就是这样“咄咄逼人”，勿须多长的时间，不仅在科学界内，而且在全国范围内必然要卷起科学技术研究的高潮。今天我们科学家应该不要愁英雄无用武之地了。科学家在旧时代，大都是所学非所用，不能发挥自己的能力。今天我们所感觉到的倒不是英雄无用武之地，而是地无用武之英雄。过去是“拊髀生叹”，现在恐怕是英雄太少，需要量过多，我们的英雄气概还不够。
    我们要打赢地球
    我们现在是向地球打仗，要征服自然，这是六万万人民的事，不只是少数科学家的事，我们应该从这个角度来考虑问题。这里我考虑了些不成熟的意见：
    （1）我们要把心向组织交出来。毛主席告诉我们：大家应该一条心，两条心、三条心、三心二意是不行的。我们要有共同的认识，共同的方向来进行工作。把心向组织交出来，当然也向彼此交出来。大家相见以诚，就是思想见面。我们一定要把思想认识一致起来，为社会主义建设老老实实地服务。如果大家不是同心同德地走一个方向的话，劲头鼓得愈大，分散性也就愈大。所以我们一定要把这一点加进去，“大家一条心”。在中国古时，周武王把殷纣王的天下打掉了。其实，殷纣王并非不是英雄，力气很大，可以同老虎对打，但是，“纣有亿万人，亿万心”，这就没有力量了。“周有臣三千为一心”。一个心的三千人却把亿万条心的亿万人打败了。我们人少、任务重、时间紧迫，如果我们还是三心二意，任务就不能完成。所以人虽少，只要大家一条心，那力量就大了。因此一定要打通思想，坚持整风，改进我们的作风，改造我们的思想。思想是可以改造的，人是可以改变的。这一点，在今天讲来，有头等的重要性。今后向地球开战，三心二意绝对不行，进行任何工作，如无统一力量，很难完成任务。
    （2）我们要进行自我教育，互相帮助，发掘我们的潜力，又红又专。要做到这点，特别是潜力的发掘很重要。一个人的潜在力量是很大的，例如，火烧房子，墙头很高，平时跳不过去，这时一下子可以跳过去。人到了危难的时候，举不起的东西也可以举起来，这是大家都有这个经验的，就是把所有吃奶的力量都拿出来。现在就要大家把吃奶的力量拿出来。当然，我并不是说，现在是什么危难的时候，而是说为了共同的利益，为了推进国家的建设，为了赶上英国水平、国际水平，我们应该把所有一切力量使出来。
    （3）体现社会主义的互助精神，做好合作协调工作，排除个人主义、本位主义和其他资产阶级思想。我们一定要很好地协调合作，体现社会主义的集体主义的精神。我们天天在讲学习苏联的先进经验，苏联的先进经验这里就是一条：就是在兄弟国家之间，社会主义国家之间尽量发挥社会主义的互助，在国与国之间发挥国际主义精神。在国与国之间都有国际精神，难道在单位与单位之间的部际精神，所与所之间的所际精神就没有了吗？人与人之间的人际精神就没有了吗？我们科学院有些听起来几乎令人难以相信的事，我们有些高级科学家住在一个房间里不讲话的这样情况都有，这是很不好的。我们一定要体现社会主义的互助精神，作好合作协调的工作，排除个人主义、本位主义和其他资产阶级思想。
    （4）发动群众、相信群众，努力科学普及的工作。我想说的群众不是科学院所属一个单位内的群众，也不是说全院一万几千人的群众，而是全中国六亿人的大群众。今后我们的革命任务是要六亿人来参加的向地球开战，我们要发动大群众，相信大群众，把科学知识交给群众。我们是靠群众的培养，才会活到现在。老实说，生活是群众给我们维持到现在的，知识是从群众中来的。所以我们应当把所有的知识交出来，交给群众，科学家应当多作一些普及的工作。在苏联，他们有这样一个规定：每个院士每年要作两次普及报告，我们中国的学部委员不知怎样，恐怕专门性报告一次都没有作，高高乎在上，如从前的翰林公一样，翰林公是骆驼，高视阔步，看不起群众，不接近群众，认为做普及工作是低人一等。我们应该打掉这种官气，不要当翰林，要当工人阶级的知识分子。今后必须大力加强科学的宣传、推广、出版工作。我们很少在报上看见科学家的宣传性的文章。拿文学来讲，差不多是遍地开花，每个地方都有文艺杂志，我们科学界却少得可怜，除科学技术普及方面有一点之外，其它是很少很少。我们既然说要发动群众、相信群众，我们就应该把六亿人的大群众作为我们的对象来普及知识，把知识交给群众。
    （5）毛主席说：知识是从群众中来、从实践中来的。毛主席也说过：知识也可从科学家的实验中来，这也是从实践中来。但我们今天应该多做些把知识从群众中取来的工作。我们民间有很多好的知识，如农业知识、医学知识。我们科学家却高高乎在上，不屑于去民间采取原料，努力加工。我们要把群众的经验提高到科学理论水平，使科学得到发展；同时又交还到群众中去，使它更加推广。
    （6）要展开百家争鸣。多开一些座谈会和学术会议展开争论。我们的学术空气太稀薄了，学术性会议也是寥寥无几。今后各个单位、各个地方，都应该在这方面把学术空气、研究空气提高起来，同时把它普及开去。
    （7）各研究所大部分成立了学术委员会。但仔细考察，好些研究所的学术委员会形同虚设，没有起什么作用，没有发挥学术委员们的作用。事实上，研究所里的学术委员比学部委员还重要。因为他们是处在前线上，是前线连队的参谋。今后研究所里应该多想一些办法发挥学术委员会的作用。一个研究所的研究计划的制定，怎样配合实际，成果如何评比、检查，科学方向的高瞻远瞩等等，是有许多事情可做的。科学院领导同志、学部领导同志、学部委员今后应该下所去看看，走马观花也可，下马更好。这样可和业务密切联系起来，接触真正的学术领导的实际。
    （8）相互学习。毛主席不是说过吗？自然科学家要学习社会科学，社会科学家要学习自然科学。我看特别是搞哲学的人如不懂新兴的物理学、经济学，那是哲学的贫困，是老的一套。当然，自然科学家也应该学社会科学，特别是马列主义，对马列主义没有研究，那就是白色的科学家，很危险。
    （9）科学家要注意文章的写作。这一条是体会了毛主席的意思，主席要我们学习做好文章。科学家应该是最能写文章的人，因为逻辑性强，概念准确。但不知怎样的，科学院拿出来的文件很多是不通的。标点乱打，几百字长才打一个句号，很不讲究。事实上，别的国家不是这样，特别是法国科学家的文章写得非常漂亮。科学家应该写好文章，尤其是理论性的文章，更要写得生动一些。今后是要加强宣传普及的时候，重要的是你的文章要使别人看懂。主席讲的：准确、鲜明、生动，就是要使人懂，使人爱看，不要使人误会。毛主席认为鲁迅的文章好，他的思想和读者立刻起交流。这很值得我们学习。我们有些搞文学的人，扭扭捏捏的，如胡风、冯雪峰，他们的目的就是要让你不懂。中国就有那么一个毛病，“以艰深文浅陋”，本来思想很浅很陋的，他一定要写得很艰深，让你莫测高深。毛主席讲话那么动人，他的文章又是那么清楚，而思想内容又是那么深刻。我们就要把艰深的思想能平易地表达出来，使任何人都可以接近。我建议：科学文学化；文学科学化。科学家也应学习一点文学、逻辑学，学点历史。科学家学起来快，特别是逻辑学还不是从科学提出来的原理原则吗？至于一般的历史，作为一个中华人民共和国的公民都应该知道一些。作为科学家，对中国科学发展历史，应多作些工作。在中国，自然科学历史资料是很丰富的，能把它整理出来，对大家很有帮助。“言之无文，行而不远”。讲话如没有一点文彩是传播不远的，一定要研究一下文章表现的技术。
    （10）是否可以多做一点教学工作？这样，科学院和教育部便能更密切地联系起来。今天培养新生力量是国家最大的中心任务。科学家的本业是提高研究，特别是科学院，我们是高层突破，要作先锋。当然，我们有我们的任务，但是行有余力，进行一些教学工作是很有必要。古人说：“教学相长”。教人家和自己研究是相互配合、相互促进的。和教育部不要分得山青水白，应尽量采取协作的态度，多多做些教学工作。如苏联科学院?斯米扬诺夫院长四天在科学院，两天在莫斯科大学。苏联的院士有好多人都是在大学里任教。另一方面，提高我们的科学水平，学习外文也是很重要的，一个真正的科学家起码要懂两国外文。最近几年来，对俄文很重视，但对其他国家文字就疏忽了一些，以后应该加强起来。
    （11）要做好准备工作，尽量发挥苏联专家的力量。这在前面已经说过。苏联专家到中国来工作，以苏联的先进经验结合中国实际，对我们来说是最好的学习机会，要抓紧学习机会来很好发挥他们的作用。
    （12）做好学术情报工作。国内国外学术情报应该广泛注意。苏联对这方面的工作作得很出色。苏联情报研究所规模之大除原子能所外，它是第二位。四千多人作工作，所联系的人还有一万多，值得我们学习。
    最后我建议，让我们把下面的四言八句作为我们共同奋斗，共同发展科学、跃进科学的精神口号：
          鼓起干劲，多快好省；
          一心一德，又红又专；
          重视劳动，服从组织；
          加强合作，实现规划。
