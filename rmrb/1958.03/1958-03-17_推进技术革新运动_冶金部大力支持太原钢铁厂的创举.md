    推进技术革新运动
    冶金部大力支持太原钢铁厂的创举
    本报讯　太原钢铁厂试行“三槽出钢法”成功的消息传来，冶金工业部的领导干部们马上集会研究如何给以支持。他们认为太原钢铁厂这个创举，不但在经济上有很大价值，而且有重要的政治意义。现在当跃进计划已经制订出来之后，重要的问题就在于如何采取措施来实现计划。从群众运动这方面来说，最重要的就是开展一个广泛、深入的技术革新运动。因此，冶金工业部决定大力提倡太原钢铁厂的革新精神，在冶金工业系统内掀起一个群众性的技术革新运动。
    此外，冶金工业部还决定马上派一个由炼钢专家们组成的技术小组，到太原钢铁厂去进行技术鉴定；决定拨给这个厂一部分资金，用来增添必要的吊车等设备。冶金工业部副部长吕东也将即日动身去太原，帮助他们总结经验。
