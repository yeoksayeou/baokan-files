A Banner for the People in Disaster Areas

The Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Dacun Township, Fengqiu County, Henan Province, has suffered severe natural disasters for four consecutive years due to its low-lying terrain and saline-alkali soil. The autumn of last year saw an even more serious disaster, with 94% of the cultivated land flooded and grain production reduced by 85%. More than two hundred households in the cooperative faced severe difficulties with food shortages for people and feed shortages for livestock. However, no difficulty, however great, can overwhelm people with ambition. The Yingju Cooperative not only completely overcame the disaster but also greatly developed various aspects of production and construction, becoming a bright banner for the overall Great Leap Forward in disaster areas.

Under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party branch, the Yingju Cooperative did not passively engage in production for disaster relief but actively addressed the disaster with a view to completely eliminating it and striving for a Great Leap Forward in production, using revolutionary methods to deal with the disaster. After the disaster in the autumn, the Party branch immediately led the masses to recall the suffering caused by disasters year after year, inspiring their revolutionary enthusiasm for production for disaster relief and for fundamentally eliminating disasters. At the same time, they summarized the experiences and lessons learned from production for disaster relief in recent years, and put forward a series of revolutionary slogans, such as "no bankruptcy, no loans, no reliance on the state, no dependence on foreign aid, no speculation," ensuring self-sufficiency, turning northern Henan into Jiangnan, and turning saline-alkali depressions into lands of fish and rice. They launched a large-scale production construction and disaster relief campaign. On the one hand, they rushed to plant and replant late autumn crops, and collected forage grass and wild vegetables; on the other hand, they used limited materials to expand reproduction, such as processing sweet potatoes into flour and pressing oil from feed (soybeans), which provided both flour residue and oil cake for feeding pigs and cattle, and also generated substantial income. Coupled with sideline occupations such as transportation, weaving, and work-for-relief, by December of last year, the cooperative's agricultural and sideline income totaled more than 44,800 yuan, exceeding the production and disaster relief plan; they also stored a large amount of forage grass and wild vegetables, transforming the cooperative from a feed-deficient one to a feed-surplus one, putting an end to the phenomenon of livestock being weak and dying abnormally. All 140 livestock in the cooperative were able to work. Thanks to good production, the cooperative not only did not borrow a single yuan from the state last year but also repaid 3,000 yuan of old loans; the remaining 3,000 yuan of old loans can also be fully repaid in the spring. In addition, the cooperative also contributed 1,000 yuan to support fraternal cooperatives facing even greater difficulties in overcoming the disaster.

While stepping up production, the Yingju Cooperative launched a earth-shaking struggle to change the backward face of the disaster area. The cooperative planned to build 40 channels, each 400 meters long, and 112 channels, each 40 meters long, totaling 76,000 cubic meters of earthwork, this winter and spring. After these projects are completed, all the cooperative's land can be irrigated, and general flood and drought disasters can be completely controlled, and the 3,000 mu of depressions, accounting for 82% of the total cultivated land, can be converted to rice cultivation. The cooperative will strive to achieve an average yield of 432 jin per mu this year, more than four times that of 1957. This grand plan greatly boosted the masses' courage to eliminate disasters. Members of the cooperative competed to donate materials and funds to support production and construction, and actively labored early and late, working under the stars. Each laborer dug an average of ten cubic meters of earth per day, increasing efficiency by more than double that of normal times.

In order to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem and increase sideline income, the Yingju Cooperative vigorously developed pig farming. The cooperative adopted the management method of "collective operation, decentralized to households, processing and feeding," setting costs, work points, tasks, time, and technology, and contracting pigs to members for feeding. This method greatly improved the enthusiasm of the members for pig raising. The number of live pigs increased from 40 in 1956 to 507, and it is planned to increase to more than 1,000 this spring, reaching an average of one pig per person in the cooperative. In order to solve the feed problem, in addition to collecting a large amount of substitutes, the cooperative, with the consent of the members, unified the management of the cooperative's 240 mu of private plots, all of which were planted with sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes were harvested and ground into flour, which provided both flour residue for feeding pigs and increased sideline income.

In the struggle to relieve and eliminate disasters, the Yingju Cooperative encountered many difficulties. The first difficulty they encountered was the shortage of food rations. The state supplied disaster areas with only 305 jin of grain per person. In order to ensure that members had enough to eat and could save grain, the cooperative adopted a unified management method, concentrating grain, radishes, and vegetables under unified control and supplying them on a regular basis. They distributed food to the masses according to the principle of tightening the belt first and then loosening it, and determining the quantity by the number of people. Before the New Year, each person averaged four liang of grain, half a jin of radishes, half a jin of sweet potato residue, one liang of flour residue, and one liang of vermicelli per day; after the New Year, each person averaged half a jin of grain, one jin of radishes, and two liang of sweet potato leaves per day. In terms of the arrangement of meals, they ate noodles or rice mixed with vegetables in the morning, sweet potato residue steamed buns at noon, and cooked spicy soup with flour residue, radishes, and vermicelli in the afternoon. Thanks to reasonable planning and proper arrangements, all the members of the cooperative had enough to eat, and both adults and children were healthy. There were no cases of fleeing famine or begging for food, and no complaints about food or money.

Another difficulty was the shortage of labor. In order to save more labor for production and construction, they adopted the methods of advance payment and creating "small markets." The grain and other major necessities needed by the members were purchased and distributed by the agricultural cooperative. Every ten days, during the time of advance payment, the agricultural cooperative's "small market" would display grain, firewood, coal, oil, radishes, and other necessities. Each household would go to the "small market" to purchase according to the amount stipulated by their labor earnings. This saved a lot of manpower. Taking collective grain purchase as an example, the state's unified sale of 100,000 jin of grain could save more than 3,000 labor days compared to members buying it themselves.

Another difficulty was the shortage of funds. In addition to making greater use of limited materials, they boldly created the method of "unified control and use of various economic forces, advance payment according to labor," so that every dime spent in the cooperative could play a role in stimulating production. The specific method was: according to the general living needs of each household and the possible number of labor days, after deducting the part that each household could raise on its own, determine the value of the advance payment labor days for each household, and implement advance payment according to labor; if members had temporary urgent needs, the cooperative would promptly resolve them at its discretion. Production inspections and living advance payments were conducted every ten days. The result of the implementation of this method was that it not only met the living needs of each household but also saved expenses, supported production and construction, and greatly stimulated the enthusiasm for production. The attendance rate of members increased from the original 230 to 432. In addition to full and semi-laborers participating in production, auxiliary laborers also participated in production. The masses generally reflected: "Now we don't worry about anything, we just want to find ways to earn more work points." The agricultural cooperative became an organization that "cannot be dispersed by the wind or broken by a stick," and the six individual farmers in the village also joined the cooperative.

    灾区人民的一面旗帜
    河南省封丘县大村乡应举农业社地势低洼、土质盐碱，四年来连续遭受严重的自然灾害。去年秋季遭灾更为严重，94％的耕地被水淹，粮食减产85％。全社二百多户，人缺口粮，牲口缺饲料，困难很大。但是，再大的困难也压不倒有志气的人们。应举社不但彻底战胜了灾荒，还大大地发展了各项生产建设，成为灾区全面大跃进的一面鲜明的旗帜。
    应举社在中共党支部的坚强领导下，不是消极地进行生产救灾，而是积极地从彻底消灭灾害、争取生产大跃进着眼，用革命的办法来对付灾荒。去秋受灾以后，党支部立即领导群众回忆年年受灾之苦，激发起群众生产救灾和从根本上消灭灾荒的革命热情。同时总结了几年来生产救灾的经验教训，提出不破产、不贷款、不依赖国家、不依靠外援、不做投机生意，保证自给，变豫北为江南，变盐碱洼地为鱼米之乡等一连串的革命口号，开展了大规模的生产设建救灾活动。一方面抢种补种晚秋，采集饲草野菜；一方面利用有限的物资扩大再生产，如将红薯加工制粉，将饲料（大豆）打油，既有粉渣、油饼喂猪喂牛，又有了大宗收入。加上运输、编织、以工代赈等副业，到去年12月间，全社农副业收入共折款四万四千八百多元，超额完成了生产救灾计划；还储集了大量饲草野菜，由缺草社变成余草社，停止了牲口瘦弱和非正常死亡的现象，全社一百四十头牲口头头都能役使。由于生产搞得好，全社去年不但没有向国家借一元钱，而且归还了三千元的旧贷；其余三千多元的旧贷，也可以在春季全部归还。另外，该社还拿出一千元支援困难更大的兄弟社度过灾荒。
    在加紧生产的同时，应举社开展了翻天复地的改变灾区落后面貌的斗争。该社计划去冬今春修四百公尺长的渠道四十条，四十公尺长的渠道一百一十二条，总计七万六千土方。这些工程完成以后，全社全部土地可以进行灌溉，一般水旱灾害完全可以控制，并且可以将占总耕地面积82％的三千亩洼地改种水稻。全社今年要争取平均亩产达到四百三十二斤，超过1957年四倍以上。这个宏伟的规划大大鼓舞了群众消灭灾害的勇气。社员们争先恐后地捐物献款，支持生产建设，并且起早搭晚、披星戴月地积极劳动。每个劳力每天平均挖土十方，效率比平常提高了一倍以上。
    为了从根本上解决肥料问题和增加副业收入，应举社大力发展了养猪业。该社采取了“集体经营、分散到户、加工喂养”的经营管理方法，定成本、定工分工值、定任务、定时间、定技术，把猪分散包干给社员喂养。这个办法大大提高了社员养猪的积极性，生猪由1956年的四十头发展到五百零七头，计划今春可发展到一千多头，达到全社平均每人一头猪。为了解决饲料问题，该社除大量采集代食品以外，并经社员同意，把全社的二百四十亩自留地由社统一经营，全部种甘薯，收割甘薯打粉，既有粉渣喂猪，又增加了副业收入。
    应举社在救灾灭灾的斗争中，曾经碰到了不少困难。他们首先遇到的是口粮不足的困难。国家供应灾区粮食，每人只有三百零五斤。为了保证社员吃饱又能节约粮食，该社采取了统一管理的办法，把粮食、萝卜、蔬菜由社统一集中掌握起来，按期供应。以先紧后松，以人定量的办法分给群众。年前每人每天平均四两粮食，半斤萝卜、半斤甘薯渣、一两粉欠、一两粉条；年后每人每天半斤粮食、一斤萝卜、二两甘薯叶。他们在饭食的安排上，每天早上吃面或米掺菜，中午吃甘薯渣馍，下午用粉欠、萝卜、粉条煮糊辣汤吃。由于计划合理，安排得当，全社社员吃得饱，大人小孩都健康，没有逃荒要饭的，没有闹粮闹钱的。
    再一个困难是劳动力不足。他们为了能节省更多的劳动力从事生产建设，采用了预支和创造了办“小市场”的办法。社员需要的粮食及其他主要生活用品，由农业社统一购买，统一配给。每到十天预支的时候，农业社的“小市场”上放着粮食、柴、煤、油、萝卜等生活用品，各户按照劳动应得的规定数量到“小市场”上去购买。这就节省了大量人力。以集体买粮来说，国家统销十万斤粮食比社员自己去买，可以节约三千多个劳动日。
    再一个困难是资金不足。他们除了以有限的物资发挥更大的作用而外，还大胆创造了“统一掌握和使用各种经济力量，按劳预支”的办法，使社内每花一角钱，都能起到刺激生产的作用。具体办法是：根据各户一般生活需要和可能做的劳动日，除去各户能自筹的部分，确定每户的预支劳动日价值，实行按劳预支；社员有临时急需，由社及时酌情解决。十天进行一次生产检查和生活预支。这个办法执行的结果，既满足了各户生活需要，又节省了开支，支持了生产建设，并且大大刺激了生产积极性。社员出勤率由原来的二百三十人增加到四百三十二人，除整半劳动力都参加了生产以外，辅助劳动力也参加了生产。群众普遍反映：“现在啥也不愁，就是想办法多做点工分。”农业社成为“风吹不散，棒打不开”的组织，村上的六户单干农民也参加了合作社。
