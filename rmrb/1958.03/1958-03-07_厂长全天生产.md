Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 5th. The directors of the Hengyang City Construction Machinery Factory, General Machinery Factory, and Cotton Textile Factory in Hunan Province have recently begun to implement a method of "participating in production full-time" to lead production. This is a new measure to improve leadership methods after the three factories implemented a system where all cadres participated in production for half a day.

The directors of these three factories were originally skilled workers, and each factory is a small factory with only one or two hundred people, so it is possible for the directors to participate in production full-time. In order to enable the directors to get rid of general affairs and free up time to participate in production, the three factories have delegated administrative power. For example, the allocation of labor, short-term leave, and the resolution of general ideological problems are the responsibility of the workshop directors; petty cash advances under five yuan are approved by the finance section; and other administrative work is handled by the deputy director in charge of business management or the secretary, and so on.

After the directors of the three factories went down to the workshops to participate in production full-time, they have discovered and solved many key problems in the past few days. For example, 97% of the total output value of the General Machinery Factory this year is to support agricultural production, and it is necessary to trial-produce seven new products. However, in February, only 60% of the monthly plan was completed by the 20th. Wu Shuzhen, the director of this factory, found that the reason for the poor completion of the task was the lack of production planning. Everyone was in charge of their own tasks, and everyone went to trial-produce new products, leaving the final process of a batch of orders unattended. Under the personal participation and organization of the factory director, the enthusiasm of the workers also came, and as a result, the task was overfulfilled in February. The Construction Machinery Factory produces gas engines, but due to low technology, it often fails to complete the task. Liu Guanghan, the director of this factory, is now working hard to study and solve this problem after going down to the workshop.

    厂长全天生产
    据新华社长沙5日电　湖南省衡阳市建设机械厂、通用机械厂、棉织厂等三个工厂的厂长，最近先后试行“全天参加生产”的办法，来领导生产。这是这三个工厂在实行了全体干部半天参加生产以后的又一项改进领导方法的新措施。
    这三个工厂的厂长原来都是技术工人，各厂又都是一两百人的小工厂，因此厂长全天参加生产是可能的。为了使厂长能够摆脱一般事务，抽出时间参加生产，三个厂都把行政权力下放，如劳动力调配、请短假、解决一般的思想问题等，由车间主任负责；五元以下的借支由财务股批准；其他行政工作由经营管理副厂长或秘书担任，等等。
    三个厂的厂长全天下到车间生产以后，几天来已经发现和解决了好多关键问题。如通用机械厂今年有97％的总产值属于支援农业生产的，并且要试制七种新产品。但在2月份里，到20日才完成月计划的60％。这个厂的厂长吴树珍在24日下到车间全天参加生产后，很快就发现任务完成不好的原因是生产无计划，各管各的，大家都去试制新产品，却把一批订货的最后工序放着不管。在厂长亲自动手和组织下，职工劲头也来了，结果2月份超额完成了任务。建设机械厂生产煤气机，由于技术不高，经常完不成任务。这个厂的厂长刘光汉下到车间后，目前正在全力研究解决这个问题。
