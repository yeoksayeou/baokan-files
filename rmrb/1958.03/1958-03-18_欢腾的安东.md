On March 16th, the banks of the Yalu River awoke earlier than usual. In Andong City on the border of the motherland, every household was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers. Pine branches formed arches, towering high above the streets, and huge banners reading "Welcome the Glorious Return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" were hung everywhere. People in festive clothing, holding flowers and colorful flags, beat drums and gongs, gathering from all directions on the avenue leading from the Yalu River Bridge to Andong Railway Station to welcome the victorious return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who had made great achievements in defending the motherland and world peace.

    Crossing the Triumphal Arch

Facing the Yalu River Bridge, the three golden characters "Triumphal Arch" on the horizontal plaque of the newly built red archway shone with extraordinary brilliance.

At a little after eleven o'clock, the long whistle of a train sounded in the distance, and the first peace train full of volunteer soldiers slowly appeared on the Yalu River Bridge. The soldiers crowded at the windows and doorways, waving bouquets of flowers given to them by the Korean people at their farewell, cheering to their relatives in the motherland. They wore commemorative badges and medals on their chests, and carried flowers and confetti that the Korean people had just given them at their farewell.

At this moment, from the Triumphal Arch to Andong Station, the sounds of military music, gongs and drums, cheers, and the farewell sounds of the Korean people from Sinuiju across the river merged into one, resounding throughout the Yalu River.

Seven years ago, on the other side of this Yalu River, the explosions of bombs from the American invading army shook the river. It was them—the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—who, bearing the hopes of the people of the whole country, braved the invaders' artillery fire and heroically crossed the Yalu River, stepping onto the righteous Korean battlefield. Today, they are returning victoriously, with the victory of the people of the motherland and the victory of the people of the world, entering the Triumphal Arch amidst the cheers of the people of the motherland.

    Welcoming the Most Beloved People

As the train carrying the heroes entered Andong Station, the welcoming crowd erupted.

Young Pioneers wearing red scarves and little girls dressed like flowers waved their red scarves and bouquets, greeting the Volunteer Army uncles.

On the platform, the welcoming crowd immediately formed countless circles. The soldiers hugged the children from Chaoyang Elementary School and Shijing Road Elementary School, lively dancing the Yangko dance to the music. The staff of Andong Department Store Wholesale eagerly embraced the soldiers. A little boy even tied his red scarf around the neck of soldier Yang Mingxuan.

The Chinese People's Delegation to Welcome the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country met with the soldiers here. Huang Zhifu, known by the Korean people as "Living Luo Shengjiao," and Li Yingcai, a first-class meritorious soldier and second-class combat hero, warmly embraced Xu Guangping, a member of the delegation. Xu Guangping said to Huang Zhifu, you have carried forward the spirit of internationalism, your mother will be proud of you, you are truly a good child cultivated by Chairman Mao.

Among the welcoming crowd were several workers from the Andong Paper Mill. They inquired about the situation of their old comrades-in-arms from the Volunteer Army. In 1950, when American planes strafed Andong, they and more than 100 young male and female workers and technicians from the factory left their beloved machines and work, embarking on the journey to Resist America and Aid Korea; after the Korean armistice, they returned to their beloved factory. Today, with ardent hearts, they came to welcome their old comrades back, to build a beautiful socialist motherland together with them.

    欢腾的安东
    新华社记者　曹志贤　任步芳
    3月16日，鸭绿江两岸，比往常更早地苏醒了。祖国边境上的安东市，家家户户张灯结彩，用松枝扎成的牌楼，高高地耸立在街头上，到处悬挂着“欢迎中国人民志愿军光荣归国”的巨幅标语。穿着节日衣着的人流，拿着鲜花和彩旗，敲锣打鼓，从四面八方汇集到从鸭绿江桥头通往安东火车站的大道上，欢迎为保卫祖国和世界和平而立下了丰功伟绩的中国人民志愿军的胜利归来。
    跨入凯旋门
    对着鸭绿江桥，新搭的红色牌楼横额上的“凯旋门”三个金黄大字，发出异样的光彩。
    十一点多钟，远远地传来汽笛的长鸣，第一辆满载志愿军的和平列车，徐徐地出现在鸭绿江桥上。战士们都拥到车窗和车门口，手中挥动着朝鲜人民送别时赠给他们的花束，向祖国的亲人们欢呼。他们胸前挂着纪念章和勋章，身上带着朝鲜人民刚刚送别时插上的花朵和撒在身上的彩纸片。
    这时，从凯旋门直到安东车站，军乐声、锣鼓声、欢呼声和江对岸新义州传来的朝鲜人民的欢送声连成一片，响彻了整个鸭绿江。
    七年前，就在这鸭绿江的对岸，美国侵略军的炸弹的爆炸声震动着江水。也就是他们——中国人民优秀的儿女，肩负着全国人民的希望，冒着侵略者的炮火，英勇地跨过了鸭绿江，踏上正义的朝鲜战场。今天，他们带着祖国人民的胜利、带着世界人民的胜利，在祖国人民的欢呼声中进入凯旋门，胜利地归来了。
    迎接最可爱的人
    载着英雄们的列车进入安东车站，欢迎的人群沸腾起来了。
    系着红领巾的少年儿童和打扮得花朵般的小姑娘，挥动着红领巾和花束，向志愿军叔叔问好。
    月台上，欢迎的人群立刻圈成了无数个圆圈。战士们抱着朝阳小学和十经路小学的孩子们，随着音乐活泼地扭起了秧歌。安东市百货批发商店的工作人员和战士们热情地拥抱起来。有一个小男孩还为战士杨明轩系上了自己的红领巾。
    中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团在这里和战士们亲热地会见了。被朝鲜人民称为“活罗盛教”的黄治富和一等功臣、二级战斗英雄李英才，和代表团团员许广平热烈地拥抱起来。许广平向黄治富说，你发扬了国际主义精神，你妈妈将为你骄傲，你真是毛主席培养的好孩子。
    在欢迎的人群中，有好几个安东造纸厂的工人。他们向志愿军打听老战友的情况。在1950年美机扫射安东时，他们曾和工厂的一百多名青年男女工人和技术员一起，离开心爱的机器和工作，踏上抗美援朝的征途；朝鲜停战后，他们又回到了自己心爱的工厂。今天，他们以炽热的心情，来欢迎老战友们回来，同他们一起，建设美好的社会主义祖国。
