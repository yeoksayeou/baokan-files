    Northeast Agricultural College Opens its Doors to Farmers
    (Our dispatch) Northeast Agricultural College, in its recently formulated leap forward plan for the school, decided to open its doors to farmers and train cadres for agricultural production. The plan stipulates that the affiliated worker-peasant middle school will continue to be run well, and most of the current graduates will be recommended to continue their studies in undergraduate programs to increase the proportion of workers and peasants among undergraduate students; a three-year agricultural administrative cadre training class will be opened to improve the technical level of agricultural administrative leading cadres; and a two-year agricultural technical school will be opened in the affiliated experimental farm using a work-study program, specifically to recruit young members of agricultural cooperatives.
