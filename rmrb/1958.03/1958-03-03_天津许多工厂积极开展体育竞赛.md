(By our correspondent) Tianjin Rongmao Processing Factory, in the great leap forward in production, is determined to have a great leap forward in developing employee sports activities as well. They put forward four conditions to launch a revolutionary competition challenge to the sports associations and Communist Youth League organizations of factories and enterprises across the country, so that sports become a huge driving force for promoting the great leap forward in production.

The Rongmao Processing Factory’s competition initiative was quickly responded to. Currently, many factories and enterprises in Tianjin have responded to the Rongmao Processing Factory’s challenge, guaranteeing that while making a great leap forward in production, they will also have a great leap forward in employee sports. The State-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, China National Native Produce & Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation Tianjin Branch, and many other factories and enterprises' sports associations have held meetings to study the issue of responding to the challenge. The sports associations of Cotton Textile Factory No. 3, Cotton Textile Factory No. 4, and other units have also initially drafted conditions for responding to the challenge.
