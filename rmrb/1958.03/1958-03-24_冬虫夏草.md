    Cordyceps Sinensis

    Perhaps it will make you wonder: on the ground, there is actually a kind of creature whose upper part is a plant and the lower part is an animal, combined into one entity.

    It turns out to be like this: In winter, the larvae of certain lepidopteran insects hibernate in the soil. A type of fungus quickly parasitizes the larvae, gradually absorbing the nutrients of the insect body, turning the entire insect body into mycelium. By summer, this fungus develops and germinates spores, growing out of the soil, becoming a kind of grass. And the lower part of this grass is the insect that entered the soil in winter, still looking like a stiff, dead silkworm. This new creature is called "Cordyceps Sinensis," also known as "Winter Worm Summer Grass."

    Cordyceps Sinensis is produced in Sichuan, Yunnan, Xikang, Tibet and other provinces of our country, generally growing in moist weeds under forests. The fungal stroma (the grass part) is yellow-brown, solitary, but also two or three branching ones, growing from the head of the worm, about several inches long, with the upper part slightly enlarged, forming a cylindrical shape. After people remove the fungal stroma, the worm part makes a great contribution to medical treatment, can replenish essence and marrow, prevent and treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and is also suitable for chronic cough, asthma, and hemoptysis. It also has good effects on neurasthenia, anemia, and stomach diseases. It is a strong and astringent medicine. In addition, it can also be stewed with duck, which is both delicious and nourishing. But when choosing, those with yellow and moist outer skin of the fungus, and fat and plump worm body are considered to be of good quality. (Yu Wen)

    冬虫夏草
    也许会使你发生疑惑：地面上竟有一种上部是植物、下部是动物合而成为一个体积的生物。
    原来是这样：在冬季，某些鳞翅类昆虫的幼虫蛰居在土壤里，有一种真菌类植物很快寄生在幼虫体内，逐步吸取虫体的养分，把整个虫体化为了菌丝。到夏天，这菌发育萌生孢子，长出在泥土上面，成一种草。而这草的下部却是冬天入土的虫，看起来仍像一条僵死的蚕虫。这种新的生物名叫“冬虫夏草”，又叫“冬草虫”。
    冬虫夏草产于我国四川、云南、西康、西藏等省，一般适生在森林下面潮湿的杂草丛中。菌座（草的部分）黄褐色、单生，也有二、三枝生的，苗生于虫的头部，长约数寸，上部稍膨大，成圆筒状。人们去掉菌座后，虫的部分对医疗上有很大的贡献，能够补精益髓，防治肺结核，又适用于慢性咳嗽、气喘和吐血等症，对神经衰弱、贫血及胃病等也有良好的效果，是一种强壮兼收敛的药品。此外还可以佐燉鸭吃，既美味而又滋补。但在选择的时候，以菌草外皮黄润，虫身肥胖、丰硕的为优良。　（于闻）
