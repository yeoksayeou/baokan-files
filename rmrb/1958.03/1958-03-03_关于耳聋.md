    On Deafness

    After I published the article "Why Does Deafness Often Occur After a Severe Cold?" in the supplement of the People's Daily on January 4th, I received dozens of letters from patients all over the country asking questions. Here are my answers to the common questions raised in these letters about "deafness":

    Deafness is a complex disease and can be broadly divided into two categories: one is called conductive hearing loss, and the other is called sensorineural hearing loss.

    The lesion of conductive hearing loss is in the middle ear. For example, otitis media, which is suppurative otitis media, is caused by pus in the middle ear, or the growth of granulation tissue, or the destruction of bone tissue, so that external sound waves cannot be transmitted to the inner ear, resulting in deafness. This disease often requires surgery. Now when we perform this kind of surgery, we not only have to cure the inflammation of the middle ear, but also pay attention to the patient's hearing. Therefore, we try to preserve the small ossicles that conduct sound waves during the operation, or implant the skin into the middle ear. Therefore, the hearing of most patients will not get worse after the operation, and the hearing of a few patients can be improved to a certain level after the operation.

    Another example is dry otitis media, i.e., catarrhal otitis media, which is caused by the blockage of the Eustachian tube. This kind of deafness often heals on its own after a short period, but it tends to recur, so it should not be delayed. When we perform tympanic membrane puncture on such patients, we can draw a lot of yellow fluid, and the patient's hearing will recover immediately. If it is not treated, this mucus cannot flow out. It can only be absorbed or organized in the middle ear, thus sticking the most flexible and sensitive tympanic membrane and ossicular joints in the middle ear together, so that sound waves cannot be conducted. Children often develop this disease due to hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids, so we should remove their tonsils and adenoids as soon as possible. Some children quickly improve their hearing after surgery. Often after a few years, we see that they have grown taller and fatter and maintain normal hearing.

    There is also otosclerosis, which is caused by lesions in the bone tissue between the middle ear and the inner ear, so that the small ossicles are stiff and fixed, affecting hearing. This disease is more common in women and often worsens after childbirth. Stapes mobilization or inner ear fenestration can be performed for this disease to restore hearing. However, patients must go to the hospital for careful examination before deciding how to treat it.

    So-called sensorineural hearing loss is caused by diseases of the sound receptor organs, namely the inner ear or auditory nerve. Examples include traumatic hearing loss, noise-induced hearing loss, Meniere's disease, and deaf-mutism. These are more difficult diseases to treat.

    For deaf-mutism, whether congenital or acquired, if we examine carefully, we can find that some patients are not completely deaf. Some still have some residual hearing, and hearing aids can be fitted to help them hear.

    People who are poisoned by streptomycin are also prone to various symptoms of sensorineural hearing loss. In recent years, the number of people who have developed deafness due to streptomycin injection has been increasing. Various therapies have been used in clinical practice, but the effects have been poor. This deserves the attention of doctors and patients.

    关于耳聋
    我在1月4日人民日报副刊上发表了“得了重伤风为何常会发生耳聋”一文以后，接到好几十封各地病家询问的来信。兹就这些信里共同提出的“耳聋”问题解答如下：
    耳聋是个复杂的疾病，可以大别为两大类：一种叫传音性耳聋，另一种叫感音性耳聋。
    传音性耳聋的病变是在中耳里面。例如耳底病即化脓性中耳炎，就是因为中耳里面化了脓，或生长了肉芽组织，或因骨质被破坏，外界的音波就不能传达到内耳，以致失聪。这种病常常须要动手术治疗的。现在我们动起这种手术来，不但要把中耳的炎症治好，还要重视患者的听觉，因而在手术中尽量保留传导音波的小听骨，或把皮肤植入中耳内，所以大多数病人在手术后的听力不致更坏下去，而且少数病人在手术后的听力能提高到一定的水平。
    又如干耳底即卡他性中耳炎，是因为欧氏管堵塞而聋掉的。这种耳聋往往经过一个短期后会自己痊愈的，但有反复发作的倾向，所以也不应耽误。我们对这种病人进行耳膜穿刺手术时能抽出很多的黄液来，病人的听力就立刻恢复。假如不治，这种粘液是无法流出来的，它只有在中耳内吸收或机化，这样就把中耳里最灵活、最敏感的鼓膜及小听骨关节给粘连起来，因而不能传导音波。小儿常因为桃体、腺样体肥大感染而引起此症，我们就应及早的把他们的扁桃体及腺样体割掉。有的小儿在手术后很快改善听力，往往几年后看见他们长的又高又胖，且保持了正常听力。
    还有耳硬化症，是因为中耳与内耳之间的骨质发生了病变，以致小听骨强直固定了，影响听觉。这种病以女性较多，且常在生育以后加重。对这种病可行蹬骨撼动术或内耳开窗术，可恢复听力。但病人必须到医院进行缜密的检查，方可决定如何治疗。
    所谓感音性耳聋是因为声音的感受器官即内耳或听神经有病。例如震伤性耳聋、躁音性耳聋、麦尼尔氏征及聋哑等。这些都是较难治的病。
    对于聋哑，不论是先天性或后天性的，如果我们仔细地检查，能发现有些病人并非完全聋掉。有的还有一点残存听力，就可配助听器来帮助他听话。
    链霉素中毒的人也容易得感音性耳聋各症。近年来注射链霉素引起耳聋者日见增多，临床上曾用各种疗法治疗，但效果不良。这值得引起医生和病家的注意。
