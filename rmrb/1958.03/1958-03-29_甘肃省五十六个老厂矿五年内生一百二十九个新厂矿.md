    Gansu Province's Fifty-Six Old Factories and Mines
    To Generate One Hundred and Twenty-Nine New Factories and Mines Within Five Years
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 27th: The fifty-six existing factories and mines in Gansu Province have decided to adopt the method of "hens laying eggs" and will be responsible for establishing one hundred and twenty-nine new factories and mines within five years.
    After careful accounting, these existing factories and mines have confirmed that their own equipment and technical capabilities have great potential. Coupled with the funds accumulated in the next few years, each factory and mine has the ability to establish one to several new factories and mines on its own within a few years. Therefore, Gansu Province has determined that this is a measure to vigorously develop local industry. For example, after tapping the potential of equipment and machinery within the factory, the Lanzhou Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory has decided to establish an agricultural tool repair factory and an animal-powered vehicle manufacturing factory.

    甘肃省五十六个老厂矿
    五年内生一百二十九个新厂矿
    据新华社兰州27日电　甘肃省五十六个现有的厂矿决定采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，在五年内负责兴办一百二十九个新的厂矿。
    这些现有的厂矿经过算细账以后，证实本身的设备和技术力量都有很大的潜力，加上今后几年中本身积累的资金，每个厂矿自己都有力量在几年内自办一个到几个新厂矿。因此，甘肃省已确定这是大力发展地方工业的一项措施。如兰州汽车配件制造厂经过挖掘厂内设备、机具潜力，确定要办农具修配厂、兽力车制造厂。
