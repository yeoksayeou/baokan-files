The National Aspirations of the Algerian People Will Surely Be Realized

At the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held three months ago, representatives from nearly fifty countries unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the heroic struggle of the Algerian people, condemning France's colonial war in Algeria, and designating March 30, 1958, as "Algeria Day of Solidarity." Today, millions of people in various countries across Asia and Africa will carry out various activities to express their solidarity with the Algerian people.

The Chinese people have always held sincere sympathy for the Algerian people. The suffering currently endured by the Algerian people reminds the Chinese people of the deep suffering they experienced in the past under colonial enslavement; the current struggle of the Algerian people reminds the Chinese people of the arduous struggles they waged in the past to smash the shackles of colonialism. Although China and Algeria are separated by thousands of miles, this shared suffering and shared struggle have fostered deep feelings between the people of the two countries. The Chinese people, who have already achieved liberation and are creating their own bright future, sincerely hope that the Algerian people can also quickly embark on the road to independence. As early as June 28, 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "In North Africa, the Algerian people are still being compelled to wage armed resistance. The Chinese people support the just struggle of the Algerian people, and at the time, cannot but deeply care about the tense situation in Algeria." Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out that "peaceful negotiations should be conducted and peace in Algeria restored on the basis of full recognition of the national aspirations of the Algerian people." These words expressed the common aspirations of the six hundred million Chinese people.

The national aspiration of the Algerian people is to demand the independent rights they deserve. To realize this aspiration, the Algerian people have continuously fought, one after another, against colonial rule for more than 120 years since the French invasion in 1830. The resistance movement led by Abd-el-Kader, which lasted for fifteen years, and the nationwide Kalibia uprising organized by Muhammad Mokrani, are extremely glorious pages in the history of the Algerian national liberation movement. The armed uprising that began on November 1, 1954, powerfully demonstrated the Algerian people's indomitable will and firm determination to fight for the right to national independence.

Ignoring this legitimate national aspiration of the Algerian people, the French government vainly attempts to maintain its colonial rule in Algeria by strengthening military suppression. Therefore, although the National Liberation Front, which leads the Algerian people's armed uprising, has repeatedly stated that if France is willing to recognize the Algerian people's right to independence, the two sides can seek a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue through negotiations; the French government has consistently refused to accept this reasonable proposal. This has made the Algerian war continue for more than three years without ending.

In the more than three years of war, French colonialists have carried out bloody massacres against the Algerian people. The French colonial army adopted the inhuman "scorched earth" policy, bombing and burning Algerian villages one after another. To this day, 600,000 civilians have been killed in Algeria, and even more have lost their homes and been forced to flee to Tunisia and Morocco. In addition, large-scale searches, inhumane tortures, concentration camps everywhere... these fascist methods have made the French-controlled areas of Algeria a terrifying living hell.

However, bloody massacres and terrorist tactics cannot intimidate the Algerian people. On the contrary, in the process of fighting against the French colonialists, the strength of the Algerian people has become increasingly strong. The Algerian National Liberation Army, which was a guerrilla force of only 3,000 people with rudimentary weapons at the beginning of the uprising, has now developed into a strong force with more than 100,000 soldiers and modern weapons. With the assistance and support of the Algerian people, it has gained control of the entire Algerian battlefield. Although the number of French colonial troops has increased from 50,000 at the end of 1954 to more than 500,000 at present, they are still being beaten everywhere and are exhausted.

Not only that, but the colonial war in Algeria has also brought France's finances to the brink of bankruptcy, its domestic political situation has been turbulent for a long time, and its international status has been weakened. These facts show that it is not in the interest of the French nation to continue to implement a policy of military suppression in Algeria. However, the French government still has no intention of pulling back from the brink.

The reason why the French government dares to go its own way and act recklessly in Algeria to a large extent is because it has the support of the United States. Everyone knows that France has received US weapons and financial "aid" in the Algerian war. According to the memorandum of the Algerian National Liberation Front, from January 1955 to August 1956 alone, the United States supplied France with 150 helicopters, 50,000 automatic weapons, 26,000 military vehicles and a large number of other military supplies. At the beginning of this year, the United States again used hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and "aid" to make up for the huge financial deficit caused by France's Algerian war expenditure. In addition, the United States has always tried its best to defend France's colonialist policy in the successive United Nations General Assembly discussions on the Algerian issue, and has obstructed the United Nations organization from taking actions to support the Algerian people's desire for independence in accordance with the principles stipulated in the Charter.

The United States' support for France to continue and expand its colonial war against Algeria is certainly not for the benefit of France. Its intention is to maintain and exacerbate the tension in North Africa, so as to seize the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, replace France's colonial position, and plunder North Africa's, especially the Sahara's, abundant natural resources. It is worth noting that the United States also attempts to bind the Algerian people to the chariot of the North Atlantic before they have achieved independence, and use them as a tool of war for the United States. It is no secret that the Western Mediterranean Treaty plan proposed by Guy Mollet not long ago was actually "wielded the knife" by Dulles. Recently, US Secretary of Defense McElroy even publicly stated that Algeria should "be regarded as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization area." These facts fully expose the United States' conspiracy in this regard.

The US colonialists are more cunning and insidious than the old-fashioned French colonialists. While participating in the bloody atrocities of massacring the Algerian people, it actually talked about its friendship and sympathy to the Algerian people. However, this hypocritical posture of the United States cannot cover up its hideous colonialist face. The Algerian National Liberation Front has repeatedly issued statements condemning the United States' support for France's colonial war in Algeria. Its representative pointed out at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference that Algeria is not fighting against one country, but against the entire imperialist alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is dominated by the United States. This is the conclusion that the Algerian people have drawn from their own experience.

The Algerian people are by no means alone in their struggle against the French colonialists and the imperialist alliance dominated by the United States. Their friends are all over the world. The more than one billion people of the entire Asian and African continents, the increasingly powerful socialist camp, and the vast working masses and progressive forces in the countries of the imperialist system all stand with the Algerian people who are bravely fighting for independence. In the current era, the complete collapse of the colonialist system is an irreversible trend, and the national independence movement has become an irresistible tide. As long as the Algerian people strengthen their unity with all anti-colonialist forces and persist in their heroic and unyielding struggle, they will surely be victorious and will surely realize their national aspiration for independence!

### 阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望必将实现

    阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望必将实现
    在三个月以前举行的亚非人民团结大会上，近五十个国家的代表一致通过决议，支持阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，谴责法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争，并且把1958年3月30日规定为“声援阿尔及利亚日”。今天，整个亚非两洲各个国家的千百万人民，将开展各种活动来表示他们对阿尔及利亚人民的声援。
    中国人民对于阿尔及利亚人民一直怀着真挚的同情。阿尔及利亚人民目前所受的苦难，使中国人民回忆起过去在殖民主义奴役下所受的深重苦难；阿尔及利亚人民目前的斗争，使中国人民回忆起过去为粉碎殖民主义枷锁而进行的艰苦斗争。尽管中国和阿尔及利亚相距千山万水，但是这种共同的苦难和共同的斗争在两国人民之间培育了深厚的感情。已经取得了解放而正在创造自己美好将来的中国人民，热诚地希望阿尔及利亚人民也能迅速走上独立的道路。早在1956年6月28日，周恩来总理就曾说过：“在北非，阿尔及利亚人民还在被迫地进行武装抵抗。中国人民支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，同时，对于阿尔及利亚的紧张局势，也不能不深切关怀。”周恩来总理并且指出，应该“在充分承认阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望的基础上，进行和平谈判，恢复阿尔及利亚的和平”。这些话，表达了六亿中国人民的共同愿望。
    阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望，就是要求得到他们应有的独立权利。为了实现这种愿望，阿尔及利亚人民在1830年法国侵入以来的一百二十多年中，前仆后继地不断进行着反对殖民统治的斗争。阿波德—卡德尔所领导的延续十五年之久的抵抗运动，穆罕默德·莫克腊尼所组织的震撼全国的卡利比亚大起义，是阿尔及利亚民族解放运动史中极其辉煌的篇页。而在1954年11月1日开始的武装起义，更是有力地显示了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立权利的不屈意志和坚定决心。
    法国政府无视于阿尔及利亚人民这种正当的民族愿望，妄想用加强军事镇压的办法来在阿尔及利亚维持它的殖民统治。因此，虽然领导阿尔及利亚人民武装起义的民族解放阵线一再声明，如果法国愿意承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，双方就可以用谈判的方式来谋求阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决；但是法国政府却始终拒绝接受这种合理的主张。这就使得阿尔及利亚战争继续了三年多而不能结束。
    在三年多的战争中，法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人民进行了血腥的屠杀。法国殖民军队采取了绝灭人性的“焦土战”，一批又一批地把阿尔及利亚的村庄炸平烧毁。到现在，在阿尔及利亚已经有六十万平民遭到杀害，还有更多的人失去了家园而被迫流亡到突尼斯和摩洛哥。此外，大规模的搜捕、惨无人道的酷刑、遍地林立的集中营……这些法西斯手段已经使阿尔及利亚的法国统治区成为一个恐怖的活地狱。
    但是，血腥屠杀和恐怖手段决不能吓倒阿尔及利亚人民。恰恰相反，在和法国殖民主义者作斗争的过程中，阿尔及利亚人民的力量是越来越壮大了。阿尔及利亚民族解放军在起义爆发时是一支只有三千人而且武器寡陋的游击队，现在已经发展成一支拥有十多万战士和现代化武器的坚强部队。它在阿尔及利亚人民的协助和支援下，已经掌握了整个阿尔及利亚战场的控制权。而法国殖民军队虽然人数由1954年末的五万人增加到目前的五十多万人，然而还是到处挨打、疲于奔命。
    不但如此，在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争还使法国的财政濒于破产，国内政治局势长期动荡不安，国际地位日益削弱。这些事实表明，法国继续在阿尔及利亚执行军事镇压政策是不符合法国民族利益的。然而，法国政府直到现在仍然无意悬崖勒马，改弦易辙。
    法国政府在阿尔及利亚所以敢于这样一意孤行，蛮干到底，在很大的程度上是由于它得到了美国的支持。谁都知道，法国在阿尔及利亚战争中，得到了美国的军器和财政的“援助”。根据阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的备忘录，仅仅从1955年1月到1956年8月，美国就供给法国一百五十架直升飞机、五万件自动武器、二万六千辆军用汽车和大量其它军用品。今年年初，美国又以几亿美元的贷款和“援助”来弥补法国由于阿尔及利亚战争开支而造成的巨大财政赤字。此外，美国在历次联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题时，总是竭力为法国的殖民主义政策百般辩解，并且阻挠联合国组织根据宪章规定的原则来采取支持阿尔及利亚人民独立愿望的行动。
    美国支持法国继续并扩大对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，当然决不是为了法国的利益。它的打算是：保持并加剧北非的紧张局势，以便伺机混水摸鱼，取代法国的殖民地位，掠夺北非特别是撒哈拉的丰富自然资源。值得注意的是，美国还企图在阿尔及利亚人民没有取得独立的时候，就强把阿尔及利亚人民绑上北大西洋的战车，充当美国的战争工具。不久前盖伊阿提出的西地中海条约计划，实际上是由杜勒斯“提刀”的，这已经不是什么秘密了。最近，美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊还公然说，阿尔及利亚应该“被视为北大西洋公约组织地区的一部分”。这些事实，充分暴露了美国在这方面的阴谋。
    美国殖民主义者比起法国的老牌殖民主义者来，是更加狡诈阴险的。它在参加屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的血腥暴行的同时，居然又向阿尔及利亚人民大谈其友谊和同情。但是，美国这种伪善的姿态毕竟掩盖不住它那殖民主义的狰狞面目。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线曾经一再发表声明，谴责美国支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争的做法。它的代表在亚非人民团结大会上指出：阿尔及利亚不是对一个国家进行斗争，而是对美国起主导作用的北大西洋公约组织这整个帝国主义联盟进行斗争。这就是阿尔及利亚人民从切身经历中所得出的结论。
    阿尔及利亚人民在同法国殖民主义者和由美国起主导作用的帝国主义联盟的斗争中决不是孤独的。他们的朋友遍于全世界。整个亚非大陆的十多亿人民，日益强大的社会主义阵营，以及帝国主义体系国家中的广大工人群众和进步力量，都是同正在为争取独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚人民站在一起的。在当前的时代里，殖民主义体系的彻底复灭已经是无法挽救的趋势，民族独立运动已经成为不可抗拒的潮流。阿尔及利亚人民只要加强和一切反殖民主义力量的团结，坚持英勇不屈的斗争，就必然能够得到胜利，必然能够实现争取独立的民族愿望！
