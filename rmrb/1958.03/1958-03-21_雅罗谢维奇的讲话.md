Comrade Vice Premier Chen Yi, Dear Comrades:

On behalf of our delegation, I thank Comrade Vice Premier for such a warm welcome. First of all, allow us to convey the most sincere socialist congratulations of the fraternal and friendly People's Republic of Poland to the comrades who welcome us, and through you, to all the citizens of the Chinese capital and all the people of China. When we want to express our deep feelings, we often feel that language is poor. It is difficult for us to express in a few words the great feelings of friendship and fraternity of the Polish working class, farmers, and intellectuals towards the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the government.

We are amazed by the Chinese people's historic efforts in the struggle for people's and social liberation, their daily labor in building socialism, and their contribution to the struggle for world peace. Here, it is also difficult for us to express our amazement in a few words.

During our delegation's visit to the capital of your great country, we would like to discuss those economic issues of mutual concern to our two countries. We hope that the economic cooperation and exchange of goods between China and Poland will develop year by year. We hope that the expanded exchange of goods based on mutual benefit can promote the rapid economic development of our two countries. We are convinced that this possibility exists, and we are convinced that our friendly talks will definitely contribute to the expansion and deepening of our economic and technological cooperation.

Our delegation is fortunate to have the opportunity to further understand the life and work of the Chinese people through this meeting.

Not only China's neighbors, but also working people all over the world, admire the Chinese people's united efforts in the socialist construction of their own country.

Our talks and direct contact will enable us to better adopt each other's experiences in the economic field.

We believe that our talks will help to further strengthen the sincere friendship and brotherly relations. It is this sincere friendship and brotherly relationship that connects Poland and the People's Republic of China, and it is also these that unite all the countries of the great socialist camp.

Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the friendship between the People's Republic of Poland and the People's Republic of China!

    雅罗谢维奇的讲话陈毅副总理、亲爱的同志们：
    我代表我们的代表团感谢副总理同志这种热情的欢迎。首先让我们向欢迎我们的同志们并通过你们向中国首都全体市民和全中国人民，转达兄弟的友谊的波兰人民共和国的衷心的社会主义祝贺。当我们要表达我们的深深感受的时候，我们就感到语言常常是贫乏的。我们在这里很难用几句话来表达波兰工人阶级、农民和知识分子对中国人民、中国共产党和政府那种友好和兄弟般的伟大感情。
    我们对中国人民在为人民和社会解放斗争中的有历史意义的努力，在建设社会主义中的日常劳动，和在为世界和平斗争中的贡献，是很惊奇的。在这里我们也很难用几句话把我们的惊奇心情表达出来。
    我们的代表团在访问你们伟大祖国的首都期间，想讨论一下我们两国互相关心的那些经济问题。我们希望中国和波兰的经济合作、货物交换逐年得到发展，我们希望基于互利基础上的扩大了的货物交换，能够促进我们两国经济的迅速发展。我们深信这种可能性是存在着的，我们深信我们之间的友好会谈定会有助于我们经济和技术合作的扩大和加深。
    我们代表团是幸运的，代表团借着这次会谈的机会，能够进一步了解中国人民的生活和工作。
    不仅中国的邻国，并且全世界劳动人民都非常敬佩中国人民在自己国家的社会主义建设中的一致努力。
    我们的会谈和直接接触，会使我们在经济方面更好的互相采用经验。
    我们认为，我们之间的会谈会有助于真诚友谊和兄弟般的关系进一步加强。也就是这种真诚友谊和兄弟般的关系，把波兰和中华人民共和国联系起来了，同时也就是这些，把伟大社会主义阵营的所有国家团结起来了。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    波兰人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间的友谊万岁！
