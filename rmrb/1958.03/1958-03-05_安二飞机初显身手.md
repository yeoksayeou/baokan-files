Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 3rd. The newly opened Hefei-Fuyang air route in Anhui Province officially opened to air traffic yesterday.

　　Flying on this route is the "An-2" passenger-cargo aircraft, which can carry ten passengers and more than 500 kilograms of cargo each time.

　　In the past, it took two days to get from Hefei to Fuyang by train or car, but now it only takes about an hour. The airfare for this route is not much different from train and bus fares.

    安二飞机初显身手
    新华社合肥3日电  安徽省新开辟的合肥——阜阳航空线昨天正式通航。
    飞行在这条航线上的是“安二型”客货两用飞机，每次可乘坐十个旅客和运载五百多公斤货物。
    过去从合肥到阜阳，坐火车、汽车要两天才能到达，现在只需一个小时左右。这段航线的飞机票价同火车、汽车票价相差不多。
