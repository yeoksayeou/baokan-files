    Mating Yellow Cattle with Water Buffalo
    Hybrid Cattle are Better than Water Buffalo
    (This newspaper dispatch) Yunnan Province, Songming County has discovered a yellow cattle-water buffalo hybrid, and its performance is better than ordinary water buffalo.
    In Xiaoshanjiao Township, Songming County, there were early legends about yellow cattle and water buffalo hybrids, which were said to produce hybrid cattle that were strong and hardy. Nine years ago, the female water buffalo of Sun Feng, a farmer in Dong Village, Xiaoshanjiao Township, was in heat. Because he could not find a male water buffalo at the time, he tried mating her with a male yellow cattle. The resulting hybrid female is now eight years old. This hybrid cattle has the advantages of both yellow cattle and water buffalo and can plow paddy fields. Now, in addition to this hybrid cattle, there are five hybrid young cattle in Songming County. Last year, the Songming County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station identified that yellow cattle and water buffalo can be hybridized. The hybrid cattle are larger than yellow cattle, with heads like water buffalo and horns like yellow cattle; their fur is gray, thick and dense, with yellowish-red tips; the tail is thick and short like a water buffalo. They eat less than water buffalo and do more work than yellow cattle; they are docile, and their pulling power is strong and enduring, plowing quickly; ordinary cattle can harrow four mu a day, while hybrid cattle can harrow five mu. Ordinary cattle cannot last for more than six to seven consecutive days of work, while hybrid cattle can persist longer. In addition, hybrid cattle have small hooves and strong legs, walk nimbly, and can travel on steeper mountain roads.
    At present, the amount of paddy fields in our country is constantly increasing, and water buffalo are becoming increasingly insufficient. Relevant departments believe that all localities can experiment with breeding this hybrid cattle.

    用黄牛和水牛配种
    杂交牛比水牛更好
    本报讯　云南省嵩明县发现了一种黄牛水牛杂交牛，性能比一般水牛更好。
    嵩明县小山脚乡早年有过黄牛和水牛杂交的传说，据说所产杂交牛力大耐劳。九年前，小山脚乡东村农民孙凤的母水牛发情，因一时找不到公水牛便和一头公黄牛试配，所生杂交母牛现已八岁。这头杂交牛兼有黄牛水牛的优点，能耕水田。现在，嵩明县除这头杂交牛外还有五头杂交幼牛。去年嵩明县畜牧兽医站鉴定认为：黄牛和水牛可以杂交，杂交牛体格比黄牛大，头像水牛而角像黄牛；毛灰色，粗而密，毛尖带黄红色；尾粗短像水牛。比水牛吃得少，比黄牛做得多；性温和，拉力大而持久，耕得快；一般牛一天耙四亩，杂交牛能耙五亩，一般牛连续使用六—七天就支持不了，杂交牛能坚持得更久些。此外，杂交牛蹄小腿健，走路灵活，能走较陡的山路。
    目前我国水田不断增加，水牛更感不足。有关部门认为，各地可试验繁殖这种杂交牛。
