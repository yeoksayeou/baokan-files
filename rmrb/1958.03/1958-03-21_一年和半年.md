One Year and Half a Year
Zhao Zonghui

On January 25th, as a member of the Lushan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's visiting delegation, I and other visitors spent a day at the Fengli Agricultural Cooperative, led by the province's renowned special-class agricultural labor model, Wen Xianglan. There, we witnessed their creations firsthand – wooden rail soil transport carts, cranes, and other new soil transport tools. We listened to the creators' reports and personally conducted experiments.

The Fengli Cooperative has a significant task of mountain and water management this year. The Fengli Cooperative branch committee of the Chinese Communist Party first calculated several major accounts. The entire cooperative's agricultural and sideline production requires a total of 156,000 workdays, while mountain and water management requires 93,000 workdays, totaling 249,000 workdays. However, the entire cooperative can only provide 190,800 workdays throughout the year, leaving a shortage of 58,200 workdays.

The Fengli Cooperative's Party members and cadres racked their brains to find solutions to this problem. Initially, everyone thought of purchasing some human-pulled carts and ox carts, but after consulting with the cooperative members, this idea was quickly abandoned. The cooperative members said, "We are in a mountainous area with steep slopes and roads, so large carts are not suitable, and buying these things is also very expensive." If buying human-pulled carts is not feasible due to lack of funds, what should be done? Could we not make our own human-pulled carts? Sun Yongzhu, the deputy director of the cooperative, thought of this problem and consulted with carpenter Liu Tongjian, making a four-wheeled wooden human-pulled cart based on the shape of human-pulled carts. "Nothing is impossible to a willing heart." From this wooden human-pulled cart, they discovered new problems. They saw that the wooden human-pulled cart moved very slowly on the soil because of its wooden wheels, and the wheels would sometimes get buried in loose soil; however, it moved very quickly and lightly on hard ground or stone slabs. At this time, Comrade Sun Yongzhu remembered seeing workers driving light railcars at the train station in Xuchang. Hao Huijiang, the Party branch secretary, also remembered seeing light railcars and cranes running on iron rails when he was working on the Huai River project in Yuxian County in 1951. Everyone felt that they had found a solution. They thought: if workers can make iron-wheeled cars, rubber-wheeled cars, iron rails, and cranes, can't we make soil railcars, soil cranes, and wooden rails? So, the branch committee decided to conduct experiments. At that time, some people worried that the experiments would not be successful, wasting money and wood. Yang Fuqing, the organization committee member, repeatedly explained to them, "We have wood, carpenters, and money to buy some iron. We can experiment with a few yuan. If it fails, we'll try again. If it fails again, we'll try again. Eventually, we will succeed." Therefore, the people who were initially wavering were also persuaded.

After the branch committee meeting, branch secretary Hao Huijiang, organization committee member Yang Fuqing, and cooperative directors Wen Xianglan and Sun Yongzhu, personally sought out carpenter Liu Tongjian for specific and detailed technical designs. After several days and nights of experiments, wooden four-wheeled railcars, wooden rails, and wooden cranes were all made. They were then tested at the Wulaigou Reservoir. But this time it failed. Although the wooden four-wheeled railcar saved labor and was several times more efficient than manual labor, due to structural and installation problems, the car overturned three times after running three times on the wooden rails, and two cars were also damaged. So, the cooperative members threw the cars and wooden rails aside and went back to carrying soil with baskets.

After the failure, some people complained, some people blamed, and some people were discouraged. But comrades Hao Huijiang, Wen Xianglan, and Sun Yongzhu never gave in, never lost heart, and never wavered. They repeatedly encouraged everyone to overcome difficulties. They consulted with carpenters and cooperative members day and night. Organization committee member Yang Fuqing, enduring the pain of illness, built a thatched hut on the mountain, slept on the mountain, and looked for solutions with the cooperative members and carpenters. Comrades like Sun Yongzhu rarely slept, and their clothes had not been taken off for several nights. Their eyes were bloodshot. Later, they finally discovered the reasons for the failure: first, the axles were too thin and not strong enough; second, the wooden rails were not installed securely and were prone to move left and right; and third, the labor organization was improper, with no fixed personnel to manage and use them. In response to the above three reasons, they carried out processing and adjustments one by one. In this way, the experiment was completely successful. On the twenty-zhang-long wooden rails, the wooden four-wheeled railcar ran like flying, making a trip every two minutes and carrying more than a thousand catties of soil per car.

At the construction site, Comrade Sun Yongzhu introduced me to the efficiency of the improved tools. He said, "After the tools were successfully tested, they were first used at the Wulaigou Reservoir. According to the original plan, the Wulaigou Reservoir would require 74 people to work every day, non-stop for eight days, and it would take 100 days to complete. After adopting the new tools, it was completed in 46 days, 54 days ahead of schedule. Originally, each person transported an average of 7,000 catties of soil per day, and 41 people transported 287,000 catties of soil in one day. After adopting this tool, the efficiency increased more than eleven times at once, and the efficiency was even higher after becoming skilled in using it. At the Dahu Reservoir, the efficiency increased to more than thirty times. Originally, each person transported an average of 2,258 catties of soil per day, but after using the wooden two-wheeled railcar, each person transported an average of 70,000 catties of soil per day. The efficiency of the crane is also not low. It can lift 500 catties at a time, which is five times more efficient than manual labor. It is also light, convenient, and safe to use. According to the current situation, we will not only manage the mountains well within a year, but we will also complete it half a year ahead of schedule. Before June of this year, we will complete all the mountain and water management tasks. The seven reservoirs will also be completed within half a year." Saying this, he pointed to the crowd on the construction site and said excitedly, "Look, how enthusiastic the cooperative members are about this tool! Everyone is vying to use it, and no one wants to fall behind." Indeed, at the Dahu Reservoir construction site, I saw things that I had never seen before. It was simply "semi-mechanized." The machines were constantly moving back and forth, up and down, like weaving shuttles. Everyone's face showed infinite joy and steely will. I was simply attracted by that charming scene. Five times and dozens of times, a year and half a year, how could this not make people happy?

    一年和半年
    赵宗惠
    1月25日，作为中共鲁山县委的参观团的一员，我和其他参观者，在全省著名的特等农业劳动模范文香兰领导的丰丽农业社参观了一天。在那里，实地见到了他们的创造——木制木轨运土车、起重机等新运土工具。听到了创造者的报告，并亲自作了试验。
    丰丽社今年治山治水任务很大。中共丰丽社支委会上先算了几笔大帐。全社农业生产和副业生产，共需用工十五万六千个，治山治水用工九万三千个，共需用工二十四万九千个。但是全社全年只能出工十九万零八百个，尚有五万八千二百个工没有人来做。
    丰丽社的党员和干部们用尽脑汁，都为这个问题想办法。一开始大家想到了购买一部分人拉车和牛车，可是和社员们一商量，就随即打消了这个念头。社员们说：“我们是山地，坡高、路陡，用不上大车，而且买这些东西又很费钱”。买人拉车没钱，那么咋办呢？难道咱们就不能自己做人拉车吗？第二社长孙永柱想起了这个问题，于是和木匠刘同建商量，按照人拉车的形状，做成了一个四轮木制人拉车。“天下无难事，就怕有心人。”他们就从这辆木制的人拉车上又发现了新问题。他们看到：木制人拉车，因为是木轮子，在土地上行驶走的很慢，有时遇到墟土，轮子就埋到土里去了；可是，它在硬地上或石板上却行驶的很快，拉着很轻便。这时孙永柱同志又想起了在许昌见到火车站上工人驾驶的轻便车在车轨上行驶的情形。党支部书记郝惠江也想起了1951年在禹县治淮时所看到的在铁轨上行驶的轻便车、起重机。大家感到有办法了。他们想：工人能作铁轮车，胶轮车，铁轨，起重机，咱就不能作土轻便车、土起重机和木轨吗？于是在支委会上决定进行试验。当时有些人耽心试验不好，浪费钱，浪费木料。组织委员杨福清一再向他们解释说：“我们有木料，有木匠，也有钱买些铁，几元钱就试验了，失败了再干，再失败了再来干，到底总要成功的。”因而原来动摇的人，也都被说服了。
    开过支委会，支部书记郝惠江、组织委员杨福清和社长文香兰、孙永柱等同志，又亲自找木匠刘同建，进行了一番具体的细致的技术设计。经过几天几夜的试验，木制四轮轻便车、木轨、木制起重机，都一一制成了。随即在五来沟水库进行试验。但这次失败了。木制四轮轻便车虽然省力，效能比人力干提高了几倍。但因为构造上和装置上的毛病，车子在木轨上行了三次，便翻倒了三次，两个车子也跌坏了，于是社员便把车子、木轨抛到一边，又用箩头担起土来了。
    失败了，有些人发牢骚，有些人埋怨，有些人灰心丧气。但郝惠江、文香兰、孙永柱等同志一直没屈服，没灰心，没动摇。他们一再鼓舞大家，克服困难。他们不分昼夜地再和木匠、社员商量。组织委员杨福清，忍着病的痛苦，在山上搭个茅屋，睡到山上，和社员、木匠一起找办法。孙永柱等同志都很少睡觉，衣服几夜没脱过。他们的眼都熬红了。后来他们终于发现了失败的原因，一是车轴太细了，不坚固；二是木轨装置的不牢靠，容易左右移动；三是劳力组织不当，没有固定专人管理，专人使用。针对上述三个原因，一一进行了加工和调配。这样，便完全试验成功了。在二十丈长的木轨上，木制四轮轻便车跑的像飞的一样，每两分钟一趟，每车能运土一千斤以上。
    在工地上，孙永柱同志向我介绍了改良工具的工效。他说“工具试验成功后，先在五来沟水库使用了。按原来规划，五来沟水库每天得出勤七十四人，八天不歇，需要一百天内才能完成。采用新式工具后，四十六天即完成了，提前了五十四天。原来每人每天平均运土七千斤，四十一个人一天才运土二十八万七千斤。而采取这种工具后，一下子便提高了十一倍多，后来使用熟练后，工效就更高了。在大湖水库，工效提高到三十余倍。原来每天每人平均运土两千二百五十八斤，而采用木制双轮轻便车运土后，每人每天平均运土七万斤。起重机的效能也不低。它一次能吊五百斤，比人力干提高了五倍。用起来又轻便，又安全。按照现在的情形，我们将不是在一年内治好山了，而是要提前半年。在今年6月前，全部完成治山治水任务了。七个水库也要在半年内全部完成”。他说到这里，用手指了指工地上的人群激动地说道：“你看，社员们对这种工具是多么热心啊！都是争着抢着用，谁也不愿落后”。的确，我在大湖水库工地上，看到了我过去所没有见到过的东西，那里简直是“半机械化”。机器像织布梭子一样，不断的穿来穿去，上来下去。每个人们的脸上都显现出了无限的愉快和钢铁般的意志。我简直被那种迷人的景象吸引住了。五倍和几十倍，一年和半年，这怎能不使人高兴呢？
