Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th dispatch: The "New York Times" published a Washington dispatch on the 10th saying that the US government has been using "secret agents" to track and investigate where news reporters get certain important information. The government sent "undercover agents" to report on the reporters' activities, and internal and external telephone calls of government agencies were being eavesdropped.

According to a reporter's complaint, his wife was followed by secret agents all afternoon one day when she went out shopping.

The "New York Times" said that the government also forced staff members to sign guarantees, stating that they had not leaked any information.

    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”10日刊载一条华盛顿电讯说，美国政府一直在使用“密探”跟踪侦查新闻记者们从什么地方获得某些重要的消息。政府派了“暗探”来报告记者们的活动，政府机关的内部和对外电话都遭到偷听。
