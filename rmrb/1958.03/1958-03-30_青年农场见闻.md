    What I Saw at the Youth Farm
    By Our Correspondent Na Yi
    The Cha Dian Youth Farm was established last autumn by more than 1,900 young students from Beijing. The farm has a total area of 17,000 mu (approximately 2,800 acres) of land, mainly for rice cultivation, as well as orchards and livestock farms. What progress have these young students made in this stage of their work, what are their hopes, and what are they currently doing? This is what people are constantly concerned about. Not long ago, I visited this farm and wrote down some of my observations here.
    Faster Steps, Stronger Shoulders
    The group of young men and women students I saw were all energetic, healthy, and had rosy, almost black complexions. I thought that if you want to know what these young students have gained, this is the first gain—the result of their participation in physical labor training. Chen Yufen and Zhao Yijun, female students from the Tenth Team, said that they gradually developed many good habits during the labor process. For example, when the Youth Farm was first established, they went to visit the Kegu (Overcome Hardship) Agricultural Cooperative, which was more than 20 li (approximately 6.2 miles) away from the farm. At that time, many students thought the road was too far and suggested taking a bus; visiting the Qinghe Farm headquarters, which was only more than 10 li (approximately 3.1 miles) away, they also suggested taking a bus. Now it seems ridiculous. What does it matter to walk 10 or 20 li! The road becomes closer and easier to walk the more you walk it. "Shoulders are also slowly pressed out." Chen Yufen said, when they went to Qilihai (Seven Mile Sea) to dig river mud, the students' shoulders were swollen and sore from carrying the mud. Many students suggested: the shoulders are swollen by themselves, let’s press them back! Strangely enough, after a few days, the shoulders stopped hurting, but people felt as if a thin layer of glue had been added to their shoulders. In the past, two female students could only carry dozens of jin (one jin is approximately 1.1 lbs) of weight, but now they can carry more than 100 jin.
    Many students who are engaged in production on the farm, especially the members of the Communist Youth League, have a common hope: to do the most arduous work and go to the most difficult places to train themselves. Ren Haipeng of the Seventh Team said, "I believe that only through arduous training can I go to the place where the motherland needs me most." Student Pan Zuokun told me that he hopes to work in the new reclaimed land. Ren Haipeng and Pan Zuokun are responsible for transporting fertilizer at night. When the mobilization to dig river mud began, the students of the Seventh Team requested to go to the most difficult construction site, Qilihai, to dig river mud. The leaders did not agree at the time, and they couldn't understand why. Later, they learned that the more arduous task of transporting fertilizer at night was waiting for them, and they were relieved. Braving the cold moonlight, the students of the Seventh Team used more than 30 large carts each time, with each cart loaded with about 3,000 jin of river mud. Ten people pulled one cart, transporting it twice each night, a round trip of more than 50 li (approximately 15.5 miles), transporting the river mud from Qilihai back to the farm's land.
    A Burst of Enthusiasm
    "Strive for a great leap forward and strive to cross the Yangtze River" has become a common saying for the people of the Youth Farm. Under this call, more than 1,000 people rushed to the most difficult place, Qilihai, to dig river mud. I took this opportunity to go to the construction site with everyone. Here, people are working hard. In the open wilderness, the weather is particularly cold. Boiling water turns into cold water as you drink it, and hot meals turn into cold meals as you eat them. The living conditions are also worse than on the farm. Under these circumstances, many students showed their spirit of hard work and endurance. Student Wen Zeliang of the Ninth Team has a stomach illness. The leadership asked him to go back to rest, but he was unwilling to bow to difficulties and insisted on digging river mud. The daily task of digging river mud for each person is 1.5 cubic meters, but he always exceeded it, digging up to 4.5 cubic meters at most. Zhang Youyi of the Eighth Team worked the hardest, wielding a large pickaxe to dig river mud, breaking through a foot-thick layer of ice. His hands were cracked in many places and bleeding, but he still kept working. New records are constantly emerging on the construction site. Cai Weicheng of the Ninth Team created a record of digging 8 cubic meters of river mud per day. Then, Zhang Shuxuan of the Sixth Team surpassed him, digging 8.7 cubic meters of river mud per day. However, Yang Jizhong of the Second Team created a new record of digging 9.3 cubic meters of river mud per day. The task of digging river mud was overfulfilled. The original plan was to dig 15 million jin of river mud, but the result was more than 20 million jin.
    Among the more than 1,900 young students in the Youth Farm, there are more than 700 female students, who are not inferior in their work. The more than 200 female students of the Tenth Team performed even better. They transported straw on the ice for five full days, completing 497% of the task.
    Part-Work, Part-Study
    A student named Tan Dasheng told me that according to the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the farm will implement part-work, part-study, which means working and studying at the same time. The farm has made preliminary plans to offer agricultural science and technology courses, including agronomy, agricultural meteorology, agricultural machinery, horticulture, animal husbandry, and plant protection. It plans to hire 20 full-time teachers. When the news of the implementation of "part-work, part-study" came out, many students were overjoyed as if they were celebrating a festival, jumping, bouncing, and telling each other. Student Tan Dasheng said that after the implementation of "part-work, part-study," students are very happy on the one hand, and feel that their burden has increased on the other. In the future, they will not only have to complete production tasks on the farm, but also complete learning tasks, work well, and study well. Now, the farm has built two large houses, each of which can accommodate more than 1,000 people. More than a dozen full-time teachers have come to the farm to make plans, and classes will start soon. I once talked to Farm Director Cao about the issue of implementing "part-work, part-study." Director Cao said to me: "Old Na, look! In another three to five years, these young students will be the first batch of agricultural technical cadres in our country who have both theoretical knowledge and practical experience." I believe that these young people will become future agricultural experts in our country and become the strong backbone for realizing the modernization of agriculture in the motherland.

    青年农场见闻
    本报记者　纳一
    茶淀青年农场是去年秋季从北京去的一千九百多名青年学生建立起来的。农场全部面积一万七千亩土地，以种稻米为主，还有果树园、牧畜场等。这些青年学生在这一阶段工作中有些什么进步，他们有那些希望，目前又在作些什么……这是人们在时刻关心着的。不久以前，我到过这个农场，把一些见闻写在这里。
    脚步快了，肩头厚了
    我看到的这群男女青年学生，一个个都精神健壮，满面红光，红里发黑。我想，要想知道这些青年学生有些什么收获的话，这就是第一个收获，是他们开始参加体力劳动锻炼的结果。十队的女同学陈玉芬、赵颐君说，她们在劳动过程中慢慢养成了许多好习惯。如走路，青年农场刚建场时，去距农场二十多里路远的克苦农业社参观访问，那时，许多同学认为路太远，提出要坐汽车去；去清河农场总场参观，不过十多里路，也提出要坐汽车。现在看来真是笑话，走他十里二十里的，又算什么！路是越走越近越走越好走了。“肩膀也是慢慢压出来的”。陈玉芬说，去七里海挖河泥，开始的时候同学们抬河泥，肩头给压肿了，发疼。许多同学提出：肩头是自己肿起来的，把它再压回去！说也奇怪，过了几天肩头也就不疼了，不过人们觉得自己的肩上好像增加了一层薄薄的胶布一样。过去，两个女同学只能抬几十斤重，现在能抬一百多斤重了。
    在农场生产的许多同学，特别是共青团员们，他们有一个共同的希望，就是作最艰苦的工作，到最艰苦的地方去锻炼自己。七队的任海朋说：“我认为，只有经过艰苦的锻炼，才能到祖国最需要自己的地方去。”潘作坤同学告诉我说，他希望到新荒地去工作。任海朋和潘作坤，他们二人是作夜间运肥工作的。在开始动员挖河泥的时候，七队的同学曾提出要求，到最艰苦的工地七里海去挖河泥。当时上级未答应，他们想不通是什么原因，后来才知道更艰巨的夜间运肥任务在等待着他们，他们这才安下心来。七队同学冒着严寒的月夜，每次三十多辆大车，一车约装河泥三千斤，十人拉一车，每夜运两次，往返一次五十余里，从七里海把河泥运回农场的土地上。
    一股子干劲
    “努力大跃进，争取过长江”，这个口号已经成了青年农场人们的口头禅。在这一号召下，有一千多人赶赴最艰苦的七里海地方去挖河泥。我趁此时和大家一同赴工地。在这里，人们在紧张地工作着。在空旷的原野上，天气特别冷，开水喝着喝着变成了冷水，热饭吃着吃着就变成了冷饭。居住的条件也比农场差。在这种情况下，许多同学表现出他们克苦耐劳的精神。九队的文泽良同学，他有胃病，领导上叫他回去休息，他不愿向困难低头，坚持挖河泥。每人每日挖河泥的任务是一方五，但他每次均超过，最多时挖到四方五。八队的张有义干得最猛，挖河泥时他抡大镐，刨一尺多厚的冰层取河泥，他的手给震裂了许多口子，都流血了，但他还是不停地干着。在工地上，新纪录不断出现。九队的蔡伟成创造了日挖河泥八方的纪录，接着，六队的张树轩超过了他，日挖河泥八方七。但是，二队的杨继忠同学又创造了日挖河泥九点三方的新纪录。挖河泥的任务是超额完成了，原计划挖河泥一千五百万斤，结果完成了二千多万斤。
    在青年农场的一千九百多名青年学生中，有七百多名女同学，她们在劳动中一点也不逊色。十队的二百多名女同学表现的更好。她们在冰上运稻草整整运了五天，完成了497％的任务。
    半工半读
    有一个谭大生同学告诉我，根据中共北京市委的指示，农场将实行半工半读，也就是一面劳动一面学习。农场已经作了初步规划，计划开设农业科学技术课程，其中有农学、农业气象、农业机械、园艺、牧畜、植物保护等专业。计划聘请二十位专职教师。当实行“半工半读”的消息传出来的时候，许多同学像过节日一样欢欣若狂，高兴地跳着，蹦着，互相传告。谭大生同学说，实行“半工半读”以后，同学们一方面很高兴，一方面又觉得自己的担子加重了。以后，在农场里不仅要完成生产任务，还要完成学习任务，要劳动得好，还要学习得好。现在，农场已修起两座大房屋，每座房屋能够容纳一千多人，已经有十几名专职教师到农场进行筹划，很快就能开学上课。我和曹场长曾经谈到实行“半工半读”的问题，曹场长对我说：“老纳同志，你看吧！再过三、五年，这些青年学生将是我国第一批既有理论知识又有实际经验的农业技术干部。”我相信，这些年青人将成为我国未来的农业专家，成为实现祖国农业现代化的坚强骨干。
