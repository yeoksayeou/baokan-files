Wowo Sweet Potato—Advanced Sweet Potato Planting Method
Yields 5-9 Times Higher Than Seedling Transplanting
This newspaper, Suining, 14th dispatch: In order to increase the unit yield of sweet potatoes, the Suining Special District of Sichuan Province is widely promoting an advanced planting method called "Wowo Sweet Potato." Using this method to plant sweet potatoes yields five to nine times higher than seedling transplanting, with yields exceeding 10,000 catties per mu. This year, the entire district planted a total of 450,000 mu of Wowo sweet potatoes, which is estimated to yield more than 2 billion catties more than last year.
Wowo sweet potato is an important experience in creating high yields in the Suining Special District. Last year, experiments were conducted in various counties. The Xingguang Cooperative in Shehong County planted 1.2 mu of Wowo sweet potatoes, with an average yield of up to 13,850 catties per mu. The Eighth Village and First Cooperative of Santai County had 1.6 mu of Wowo sweet potatoes with an average yield of 8,420 catties per mu, and also harvested more than 500 catties of interplanted corn. The old planting method for sweet potatoes only yielded an average of 1,500 catties per mu. (Ding Fan)

    窝子苕—甘薯先进栽植法
    比育苗移栽产量高5—9倍
    本报遂宁14日电　四川遂宁专区为提高红苕（甘薯）单位产量，普遍推广一种称为窝子红苕的先进栽植法。用这种方法种红苕，要比育苗移栽产量高出五倍至九倍，亩产万斤以上。今年全区共栽窝子红苕四十五万亩，估计可比去年多收二十多亿斤。
    窝子红苕是遂宁专区创造高产的重要经验。去年即在各县进行试验。射洪县星光社种了一亩二分窝子红苕，平均亩产高达一万三千八百五十多斤。三台县八村一社一亩六分多窝子红苕平均亩产八千四百二十多斤，另外还收了间种的包谷五百多斤。而旧法栽植红苕平均每亩只收一千五百斤。　（丁帆）
