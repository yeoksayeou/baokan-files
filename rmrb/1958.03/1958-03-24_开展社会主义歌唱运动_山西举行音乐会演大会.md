Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 23rd: At the Shanxi Provincial Music Performance Convention, which closed on the 20th, more than two hundred singers joyfully sang about socialist production and construction, and the happy life of the people.

This convention was a review of the socialist singing movement currently sweeping across Shanxi Province. The majority of the three hundred plus representatives who participated in the convention came from rural areas. The two hundred and twenty-four performances they presented were mostly reflections of cooperativization, the great leap forward in agriculture, and praises of the new life. Among them, ninety-three were songs created and adapted by the masses based on their own lives and production struggles, such as "Good Scenery in Every Village and Commune," "Having Food and Clothing," "Song of the Great Leap Forward," and "Zhangbei Canal is a Money Tree."

The representatives who participated in the convention put forward a proposal to various parts of Shanxi Province to "Resolutely Resist Yellow Music and Vigorously Launch a Socialist Singing Movement."

    开展社会主义歌唱运动
    山西举行音乐会演大会
    据新华社太原23日电　在20日闭幕的山西省音乐会演大会上，二百多歌手欢唱了社会主义的生产建设和人民群众的幸福生活。
    这次会演是山西省正在掀起的社会主义歌唱运动的一次检阅。参加会演的三百多个代表大部分来自农村，他们演唱的二百二十四个节目，绝大部分是反映合作化、农业大跃进和赞颂新生活的。其中有九十三个是群众根据自己的生活和生产斗争创作和改编的歌曲。如“村村社社好风光”、“有吃有穿”、“大跃进之歌”、“漳北渠是摇钱树”等。
    参加会演的代表向山西省各地提出了“坚决抵制黄色音乐大力开展社会主义歌唱运动”的倡议。
