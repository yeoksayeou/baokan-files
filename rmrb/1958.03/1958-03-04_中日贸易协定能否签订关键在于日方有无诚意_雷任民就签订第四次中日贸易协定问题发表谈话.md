Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—Lei Renmin, Vice-Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, told Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing this afternoon that the Chinese side had made all the preparations for the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Whether the agreement can be signed at present depends on the sincerity of the visiting Japanese trade delegation.

Lei Renmin is the chief representative of the Chinese side responsible for the negotiations. At the press conference, he first mentioned that the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Japanese trade delegation had already reached an agreement on the draft agreement and memorandum in Beijing as early as November 1 last year, and issued a joint statement. At that time, it was only because the Japanese side needed to return to their country for further discussions on the number of personnel in the non-governmental commercial representative offices to be established by both sides that they proposed a temporary adjournment. This time, before the Japanese trade delegation came to Beijing on February 25 at the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade to sign the agreement, they stated that they fully agreed with the draft agreement and memorandum passed by both sides last year.

Lei Renmin said that the Chinese side originally hoped that the delegation could sign the agreement as soon as they arrived in Beijing, but now a week has passed, and not only has the agreement not been signed, but no plenary meeting of representatives from both sides has been held. Only the chief representatives of both sides have had some individual contacts.

Lei Renmin then introduced to the reporters the situation of his individual talks with the chief representative of the Japanese side, Masanosuke Ikeda. He pointed out that the reason why the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has not been signed so far is entirely because the Japanese trade delegation, after arriving in Beijing, raised some additional issues out of the blue, attempting to substantially revise the draft agreement and memorandum unanimously passed by both sides last year. Lei Renmin cited as an example that the non-governmental commercial representative offices mutually established by both sides have the right to fly their national flags, which is inherently justified, but the Japanese side has proposed amendments attempting to restrict the Chinese commercial institutions from flying the Chinese national flag. The Japanese side also raised different amendments to some clauses stipulated in the draft agreement, which require the consent of both governments for implementation, attempting to cancel the guarantee that the Japanese government should give for the implementation of the agreement. On the issue of the number of personnel in the commercial institutions, they also attempted to overturn the principle that both sides had originally agreed last year that the number should not be restricted and that both sides could send personnel according to work needs.

Lei Renmin said that since the Japanese side could not deny the fact that the draft agreement and memorandum had been unanimously passed by both sides, and that the Japanese delegation came to China this time on the basis of fully agreeing with the draft agreement and memorandum, they initially attempted to achieve the goal of making substantial revisions to the original draft agreement and memorandum under the pretext of "textual amendments." Later, they proposed to add so-called "understandings" to the memorandum to overturn the principles that both sides had originally mutually confirmed.

Lei Renmin also mentioned that in the process of negotiating the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement last year, the Chinese side had made as many concessions as possible on many issues such as commodity classification, the loan payment methods of both banks, and commodity inspection, agreeing to the opinions put forward by the Japanese side, which promoted the unanimous passage of the draft agreement and memorandum. Therefore, he affirmed that the Chinese side would definitely not agree to any substantial modifications to the clauses in the draft agreement and memorandum that both sides had already unanimously agreed upon.

Lei Renmin said that the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement will surely be conducive to the development of Sino-Japanese trade. The Chinese side has always maintained an optimistic and positive attitude towards the signing of the agreement and the development prospects of Sino-Japanese trade. On the Japanese side, the broad masses of the Japanese people warmly welcome the signing of the trade agreement, and many Japanese industrialists who have insight into the current economic situation in Japan and the world also warmly welcome the signing of this agreement. However, at the same time, we cannot fail to see that there are still a few people in Japan who are deliberately undermining this agreement and the development of trade relations between China and Japan. Lei Renmin finally pointed out that whether this agreement can be signed smoothly and quickly will be a test of how much sincerity the Japanese trade delegation has towards this agreement and promoting the development of Sino-Japanese trade.

    中日贸易协定能否签订关键在于日方有无诚意
    雷任民就签订第四次中日贸易协定问题发表谈话
    新华社3日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民今天下午在北京对中外记者说，中国方面已做好签订第四次中日贸易协定的一切准备工作，目前协定能否签成，取决于前来签字的日本通商使节团有无诚意。
    雷任民是中国方面负责谈判的首席代表。他在记者招待会上首先谈到，中国国际贸易促进委员会同日本通商使节团早在去年11月1日已就协定草案和备忘录在北京达成一致协议，并且发表了共同声明。当时只是因为日本方面在双方互设民间商务代表机构的人数问题上还需要回国继续商讨，才由他们提出暂时休会。这次日本通商使节团在2月25日应中国国际贸易促进委员会的邀请重来北京签字前，他们又曾表示对双方去年通过的协定草案和备忘录完全同意。
    雷任民说，中国方面本来希望代表团来到北京后马上就能签字，但是现在已过了一星期，不但没有签字，也没有召开双方代表的全体会议，只是双方首席代表做了一些个别接触。
    雷任民接着向记者们介绍了他同日方首席代表池田正之辅个别交谈的情况。他指出，第四次中日贸易协定所以到现在还没有进行签字，完全是由于日本通商使节团来到北京以后，又节外生枝地提出了若干问题，企图从本质上修改去年双方一致通过的协定草案和备忘录。雷任民举例说，双方互设的民间商务代表机构有权悬挂本国国旗，这本来是天经地义的事情，而日本方面却又提出企图限制中国商务机构悬挂国旗的修改意见。协定草案中规定的有些条文的执行需取得双方政府的同意，日本方面也提出不同的修改意见，企图取消日本政府对协定执行应给予的保证。在商务机构的人数问题上，他们也企图推翻双方在去年原已同意人数不得加以限制和双方可以根据工作需要选派人员的原则。
    雷任民说，由于日本方面也不能否认协定草案和备忘录已经过双方一致通过，以及这次日本代表团是在完全同意协定草案和备忘录的基础上前来中国的事实，因此他们起先以“文字修改”的借口企图达到对原协定草案和备忘录做本质修改的目的，后来又提出在备忘录中附加所谓“谅解条件”，以推翻双方原已互相确认的原则。
    雷任民还谈到，在第四次中日贸易协定去年进行谈判的过程中，中国方面曾经在商品分类、双方银行的贷款支付办法、商品检验等不少问题上作了尽可能的让步，同意日本方面所提出的意见，促使了协定草案和备忘录的一致通过。因此他肯定地表示，现在对于双方已经一致同意的协定草案和备忘录中的条款，中国方面决不同意再作任何本质上的修改。
    雷任民说，第四次中日贸易协定的签订必将有利于中日贸易的发展，中国方面对协定的签订和中日贸易的发展前途始终抱着乐观的积极的态度。在日本方面，日本广大人民热烈欢迎贸易协定的签订，许多对目前日本和世界经济情况有见识的日本实业家们，也热烈欢迎这次协定的签订，但同时也不能不看到日本还有少数人在蓄意破坏这次协定和中日双方贸易关系的发展。雷任民最后指出，这次协定究竟能否很快地顺利签订，将是日本通商使节团对这次协定和促进中日贸易的发展究竟具有多少诚意的一次考验。
