A Factory Without Workers

    This newspaper reports that in Kaicun, Qin County, there is a factory that people call a "factory without workers," which is now producing granular fertilizer in large quantities. It is estimated that this factory will produce 3,000 tons of granular fertilizer this year for use by all 279 agricultural cooperatives in the county.

    People say it "has no workers" because there are no permanent workers engaged in production here.

    The Kaicun Granular Fertilizer Factory is jointly run by the Qin County United Processing Factory and all 279 agricultural cooperatives in the county. According to the contract: the Qin County United Processing Factory only sends two or three people to be responsible for technical guidance, administrative management, and political and ideological leadership, and all the remaining labor is entirely undertaken by the agricultural cooperatives sending people in shifts. The produced granular fertilizer is ordered by the agricultural cooperatives. When the cooperative members are producing in the factory, the factory records work points for them, and they will receive remuneration directly from their agricultural cooperative in the future; the factory pays for the granular fertilizer according to the labor provided by each agricultural cooperative. When it is busy with farming, the factory stops work, and the cooperative members all return to the cooperative for production.

    没有工人的工厂
    本报讯　在沁县的开村，有一个人们叫做“没有工人”的工厂，现在正在大量生产颗粒肥料。预计这个工厂今年将生产三千吨颗粒肥料，供全县二百七十九个农业社使用。
    人们说它“没有工人”，是因为在这里进行生产的没有一个固定工人。
    开村颗粒肥料厂，是由沁县联合加工厂和全县二百七十九个农业社合办的。按照合同规定：沁县联合加工厂只派两三个人负责技术指导、行政管理和政治思想领导工作，其余全部劳动力完全由各农业社轮流派人担负。生产出来的颗粒肥料由农业社订购。社员们在厂里生产时，由工厂给记工分，将来直接向所在的农业社领取报酬；工厂则按照每个农业社供给的劳力支给颗粒肥料。到农忙的时候，工厂就停工，社员们全部回社生产。
