Each Cooperative Can Buy One

On the morning of March 1st, the Jun County farmer visiting delegation, headed by Li Dagui, the founder of water diversion up the mountains in Hubei Province, visited the Wuhan State-owned Universal Machinery Factory.

The staff of the Universal Machinery Factory held a get-together and a forum for the guests, and also demonstrated the operation of a small universal tractor. During the demonstration, Li Dagui sat side-by-side with the driver on the machine platform, and learned how to drive the tractor after only two laps. He happily said, "This small iron ox can replace more than thirty first-class oxen. In the future, each of our cooperatives can buy one."

    社社都可以买一部
    3月1日上午，以湖北省引水上山的创始人李大贵为首的均县农民参观访问团，访问了武汉国营通用机器厂。
    通用机器厂的职工为客人举行了联欢会、座谈会，还表演了小型万能拖拉机的操作。表演时，李大贵与司机并排坐在机台上，只转了两个圈，就学会了开拖拉机。他高兴地说：“这个小铁牛可以顶三十多头头号牛，将来我们每个社都可买一部。”
