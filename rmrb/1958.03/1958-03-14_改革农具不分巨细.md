Editor's Note:

    Spring plowing preparation time is short, and there is a lot of work to be done. All regions generally feel that there is a shortage of labor. Rationally organizing the labor force and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses are methods to solve this contradiction. However, this is not enough; an important method lies in reforming farm tools. Xue Xinwang and others in Xiangyang, Hubei, created a rice seeder, and the sowing efficiency is ten times higher than by hand. This is a remarkable thing. Using this tool, one person can do the work of ten people, and one day can do the work of ten days. Isn't this the best way to solve the problems of too much farm work, tight schedule, and insufficient manpower!

    Some people look down on the reform of small farm tools; they believe that whether they are reformed or not will not solve any major problems. In fact, this is not the case. Take this seeder as an example. Timely sowing allows for timely raising of seedlings, and timely transplanting of seedlings into the fields. In this way, early rice can increase unit yield, and the next crop can be planted on schedule. It can be seen that any small farm tool reform has a positive effect on production, which is certainly not a trivial matter!

    改革农具不分巨细
    春耕准备时间短暂，要作的活很多，各地普遍感到劳力不足。合理组织劳动力、充分发挥群众积极性，是解决这个矛盾的方法。但是，这还不够，重要的方法在于改革农具。湖北襄阳薛心旺等创造水稻撒种器，播种效率比用手提高十倍，这是一件了不起的事。用这种工具，一个人能作十个人的农活，一天能干十天的农活，这不正是解决了农活多、时间紧、人力不足的最好的方法吗！
    有些人看不起小农具的改革；他们认为改不改解决不了什么大问题。其实不然。就拿这个撒种器来说吧，及时播种，就能及时育成秧苗，及时把秧插到田里。这样，早稻就可以提高单位产量，并且能使下一季作物如期种上。由此可见，任何一件小农具改革，对生产都有积极作用，这当然也就不是小事了！
