A Middle School Founded with One Hundred Yuan
By our reporter Zhong Lin

At the symposium on education issues held by Premier Zhou Enlai on February 9th and 12th, Comrade Kang Sheng mentioned in his speech that the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, used one hundred yuan to found a middle school. This news attracted a lot of attention: How was this middle school founded? How is it doing?

This middle school, run by the agricultural cooperative itself, used more than fifty thatched houses in the cooperative for sideline production such as grinding flour, and converted the eight main rooms on the left side of the front row, after renovation, into three classrooms and an office. Although the houses were simple, they were cleaned very well.

The blackboard in the classroom was made by plastering a relatively thick layer of mud in the center of the wall, applying mortar, and then coating it with soot. In front of the blackboard was a high wooden stool used as a teacher's desk. The students' desks in the first few rows were made with waste bricks as legs and brick mold frames turned upside down as the surface; the desks in the back rows were also made of high wooden stools. These high wooden stools and brick mold frames were used by the cooperative's former brick kiln to make brick blanks, but now that they no longer fire bricks, they have been used as desks. The stools for sitting in class were brought by the students themselves from their homes.

The doors, windows, walls of the office and three classrooms, as well as more than one hundred and eighty desks, were all repaired and installed by the cooperative members with more than one hundred free labor days in the three days before the start of school.

The source of funding for this school is the tuition fees paid by the students. Each student pays five yuan in tuition per semester, and two jiao when applying. In the first semester, a total of one hundred and eighty students paid the application fee, one hundred and fifty-eight students paid the full tuition, and twenty-two students paid partial tuition, totaling seven hundred and seventy-six yuan. On the expenditure side: the salaries of six teachers, lime and other materials for repairing the school buildings, and some books, chalk and other stationery for teaching, totaled seven hundred and twenty-nine yuan. Now, they still have a surplus of more than forty yuan. If the tuition fees are collected in full, they can have a surplus of nearly one hundred yuan. They plan to further reduce expenses and lower tuition fees next semester.

The principal of the school is concurrently held by the cooperative director Luo Shifa. The six teachers are high school graduates from Xindu Middle School in the neighboring county in the summer of 1957. Because they did not have teaching experience, they first went to Xindu Middle School to listen to lectures and learn from teachers how to prepare lessons and how to teach, and then went back to teach. They not only teach, but also work in academic affairs, general affairs, and also do the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. They also ring the bell for the start and end of classes themselves. They do the cleaning and sanitation work of the school together with the students. In addition to doing things in the school, they also actively participate in other activities of the agricultural cooperative.

The students of this school attend classes in the morning, and also review their lessons before and after class, and participate in agricultural and sideline production or housework in the afternoon. Student Zhou Yiqin, whose parents died early, lives alone with his elder brother and sister-in-law after the family was divided. This semester, in addition to studying hard, he also earned more than one thousand and one hundred work points in agricultural and sideline labor, earning more than sixty yuan, which not only solved the learning expenses, but also solved the difficulties of life. Some students who are younger and have weaker labor force also actively undertake housework, freeing up stronger laborers in the family to go to production.

This kind of half-farming and half-studying school does not hinder the students' academic performance. According to the teachers, the courses offered in the first semester of this school, such as: Chinese language, literature, arithmetic, botany, history and geography, all use standard textbooks from ordinary middle schools. They had twelve weeks of classes in the first semester, but later because the teachers participated in the rectification study, they had a winter vacation, and the unfinished courses will be made up when school starts next semester. They took test questions from other middle schools, and added content, and took them to test the students. The results of the test showed that the total average score was: students ranked A accounted for 16% of the school's students, B accounted for more than 40%, C accounted for 33%, and failing accounted for 10%. But judging from their original foundation, the progress is still not slow. If the students work harder and the teachers pay more attention, they can catch up.

Now, the members of the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative are discussing the draft of the Agricultural Development Program and are brewing how to make the cooperative's production leap forward. They hope that this middle school run by the cooperative can play a greater role in the agricultural production leap forward, and especially hope that the students trained by this middle school can quickly play a major role in improving agricultural and sideline production technology and improving the cooperative's financial accounting and other work. Some production team leaders, work recorders, and custodians who have not enrolled in school also requested to be able to enroll. This summer alone, the Hedeng Township where the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative is located will have seven classes of about three hundred and fifty to sixty elementary school students graduating, and many of them hope to attend this middle school. In this way, this middle school urgently needs to add courses such as agricultural technology. If there are no agricultural technology textbooks, they will find ways to compile them themselves, or ask comrades from the agricultural technology guidance station to teach. It is also necessary to greatly increase the number of students and classes. At the same time, it is also necessary to ensure the quantity and quality of teaching. These tasks are very arduous. However, the leaders of the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative and several teachers are full of enthusiasm and determined to overcome all difficulties, further implement the policy of combining education and production, adhere to the method of running schools diligently and thriftily and half-farming and half-studying, so that this middle school run by the agricultural cooperative can truly "take root, sprout, blossom and bear fruit."

### 一百元办一所中学

    一百元办一所中学
    本报记者　钟林
    在周恩来总理2 月9日和12日召开的教育问题座谈会上，康生同志在发言中提到四川省新繁县新民农业合作社用了一百元办一所中学的事。这个消息引起许多人的注意：这所中学是怎样办的呢？办得怎么样呢？
    这所由农业合作社自办的中学，利用社里搞磨粉等副业生产五十多间草房腾出前一排左边的八大间，经过修整，改成了三个教室和一个办公室。房子虽简陋，却打扫得很干净。
    教室里的黑板，是在墙壁正中糊上比较厚的泥，抹上灰浆，再涂上锅烟做成的。黑板跟前放着一张高木凳作为教师的讲桌。学生们的课桌，前几排是用废砖作腿，砖模框子翻转来作面做成的；后几排也是用的高木凳。这些高木凳和砖模框子，是社里从前办的砖瓦窑做砖坯时用的，现在不烧砖了，它们就被利用来作了课桌。上课坐的凳子，是学生们自己从家里带来的。
    办公室和三个教室的门窗、墙壁、以及一百八十多张课桌，都是在开学前三天内，由社员们出了一百多个义务工修理和安置起来的。
    这个学校的经费来源是学生缴的学费。每个学生每学期缴学费五元，投考报名时缴费二角。第一学期共收了一百八十名学生的报名费，一百五十八名学生的全部学费，和二十二名学生的部分学费，合计共收入七百七十六元。开支方面：是六个教师的薪金，修理校舍的石灰等材料和教学用的部分书籍、粉笔和其他文具等，共开支七百二十九元。现在，他们的经费还节余了四十多元。如果学费收齐，他们可以结余近百元钱。他们下学期打算再节省一些开支，并且降低学费。
    学校的校长是由社长罗世发兼任的。六位教师是邻县新都中学1957年夏季的高中毕业生。因为没有教课的经验，他们就先到新都中学去听课，并且向老师学习如何备课，如何讲课，然后回去教课。他们不仅教课，还兼作教务、总务方面的工作，还作团和队的工作。上课下课的铃也是他们自己打。学校的清洁卫生工作，他们跟学生一起作。他们除了作学校里的事而外，还积极参加农业社的其他活动。
    这个学校的学生上午在校上课，上课前后还要复习功课，下午参加农、副业生产或家务劳动。学生周以勤，父母早亡，他跟哥嫂分了家单独过日子，这个学期他除了学好功课以外，还在参加农副业劳动中挣了一千一百多个工分，收入六十多元，不仅解决学习费用，也解决了生活困难。有些年纪较小、劳动力不强的学生，他们也积极担负了家务劳动，腾出家中劳动力较强的人去生产。
    这样半耕半读的学校，并不会妨碍学生的学习成绩。据教师们谈，这个学校第一学期所开的：汉语、文学、算术、植物、史地等课，都是采用普通中学的标准课本，第一学期他们上了十二周课，后来因为教师参加整风学习放了寒假，未完的课程要等下学期开学再补。他们曾从别的中学拿了考题，并且增加了内容，拿去考学。考的结果，总平均成绩是：名列甲等的学生占全校学生的16％，乙等的占40％强，丙等的占33％，不及格的占10％。但从他们原来的基础看，进步还是不慢，如果学生再努一把力，教师也多注意一些，他们是可以迎头赶上的。
    现在，新民农业合作社的社员们正在讨论农业发展纲要草案，并酝酿着如何使社的生产大跃进，他们希望社里办的这个中学在农业生产大跃进当中能发挥更大的作用，特别希望这个中学培养的学生，能够迅速地在改进农、副业生产技术，改进社里的财务会计等工作方面起重大作用。社里一些没有入学的生产队长、记工员、保管员等也要求能够入学。今年夏天，仅新民农业合作社所在的禾登乡，就将有七个班约三百五、六十名高小学生毕业，其中很多人都希望上这个中学。这样，这所中学迫切需要增加农业技术等课程，没有农业技术课本就自己设法编，或者请农业技术指导站的同志来教课。也需要大大增加学生名额和班、级。同时还要保证教学的数量、质量。这些任务是很艰巨的。可是，新民农业合作社的领导人员们和几位教师，都干劲十足地决心克服一切困难，进一步贯彻教育和生产相结合的方针，坚持勤俭办学、半耕半读的办法，使这所农业合作社办的中学真正“生根发芽，开花结果”。
