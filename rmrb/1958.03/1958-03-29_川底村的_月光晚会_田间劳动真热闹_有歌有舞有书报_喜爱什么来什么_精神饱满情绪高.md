    "Moonlight Soiree" in Chuandi Village
    Field Labor is Lively and Bustling, with Songs, Dances, and Newspapers
    Whatever is Liked is Provided, Spirits are High and Emotions are Uplifted
    The above four lines are a quick-rhythm poem self-composed by the masses of Chuandi Village in Pingshun County, Taihang Mountains, describing their labor and cultural life. Adhering to the principles of voluntarism, thrift, and serving the masses, the Chuandi Village Club has organized a variety of cultural and recreational activities. In the past five years, with the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the improvement of the lives of cooperative members, the farmers' interest in singing and dancing throughout the village has become increasingly strong.
    What best expresses the joy in the hearts of the farmers of Chuandi Village is the "Moonlight Soiree" held every fifteenth day of the lunar month. At each gathering, there are songs, dances, operas, and folk tunes. The whole village, old and young, are both audience members and performers. Someone sings a few lines, someone else dances for a while, before the singing is over, a clapper talk (kuaiban) begins, and as soon as the dancers sit down, a yangge team twirls into the field. Once at a "Moonlight Soiree" last summer, someone from the CCP Chuandi Village Branch took the lead and sang a clapper talk: "This year, July weather is dry, the crops in the fields are dry and parched." Someone from the crowd immediately followed: "In order to ensure a bumper harvest and no reduction in production, we must water the seedlings and carry water." Someone from the Third Labor Group then sang: "Empty slogans won't do, I and the Fifth Group challenge you." The head of the Fifth Group immediately replied: "Tomorrow we will do practical work and let our director judge." Singing and responding like this went on until late at night. The next day, the village launched a vigorous campaign to fight drought and protect seedlings. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    川底村的“月光晚会”
    田间劳动真热闹　有歌有舞有书报
    喜爱什么来什么　精神饱满情绪高
    上面四句是太行山区平顺县川底村群众自编的描写他们劳动和文化生活的快板诗。川底村俱乐部本着自愿、节俭、为群众服务的方针，组织了多种多样的文化娱乐活动。最近五年来，随着农业社的巩固和社员生活的提高，全村农民歌舞兴趣越来越浓厚了。
    最能表达川底村农民内心欢快的是每月阴历十五举行的“月光晚会”。每次会上，有歌有舞，有戏有曲。全村老幼是观众，又是演员。你唱几句，他跳一阵，歌声未落，快板开了腔，跳舞的人刚落坐，秧歌队就扭进场。去年夏季有一次“月光晚会”，中共川底村支部有人带头唱起快板：“今年7月天气旱，庄稼地里干又干”。群众中就有人接着唱：“为了丰收不减产，就得浇苗把水担”。第三劳动小组又有人唱：“空喊口号那能算，俺和五组来挑战”。五组组长马上回答：“明天咱就实际干，叫咱主任来评判”。这样一唱一和，直到深夜。第二天村里便掀起了热火朝天的抗旱保苗活动。　（新华社）（附图片）
