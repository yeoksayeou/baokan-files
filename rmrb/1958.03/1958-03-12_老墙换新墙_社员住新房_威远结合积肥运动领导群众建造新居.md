Old Walls for New Walls: Commune Members Live in New Houses
Weiyuan Combines Manure Collection with Leading the Masses to Build New Residences

In Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, about 30% of the rural houses were originally dilapidated, frequently causing casualties to people and livestock due to collapses. Whenever there were strong winds and heavy rain, some farmers dared not sleep soundly in their houses. In addition, residences were very scattered, with households far apart, which not only occupied a lot of land but also made it inconvenient for work and production. Weiyuan County originally planned to solve this problem in a few years. After the socialist education and the encouragement of the Forty Articles Program, the broad masses of farmers, in order to strive to achieve a yield of 800 jin per mu, enthusiastically demanded that some very dilapidated houses be demolished and residential areas be built in conjunction with the manure collection campaign. After mass discussions, various agricultural cooperatives formulated plans and established special construction teams and demolition teams, demolishing and building simultaneously. Their slogan was: "Old walls for new walls, mutual assistance to build new houses, increased production within the cooperative, commune members live in new houses."

The Weiyuan County Party committees at all levels closely relied on the masses, successfully solved the difficulties of materials, labor, and technology, and achieved economy, speed, quantity, and quality. All the materials needed for repairing houses were dismantled from the old houses and could still be used after processing and adjustment. In the construction process, various places only purchased some nails, about two jin of nails per room, costing more than one yuan. Farmers who moved into new houses only needed to sell a chicken to cover the cost. The state and the agricultural cooperatives did not spend any money.

The planning of these houses was based on benefiting production and appropriately taking care of the old habits of the farmers. Generally, a production team was the unit, with about ten households forming a residential area in a relatively central location. Farmers are very satisfied with these houses. They summarized that the newly built residential areas have eight major advantages: (1) They are strong and durable, and people are no longer afraid of wind and rain. (2) The kitchen and pigsty are separated, improving sanitary conditions. (3) It is convenient and orderly to go to work, which can improve labor efficiency. (4) It saves a lot of land. (5) It is convenient for meetings and study, without being restricted by weather and time. (6) It facilitates the establishment of public welfare undertakings such as nurseries, kindergartens, and people's schools. (7) It is convenient for supply and marketing cooperatives to supply and purchase goods. (8) It helps to eliminate the four pests.

Around the Spring Festival, more than 7,000 households in the county happily moved into new homes.

### 老墙换新墙　社员住新房  威远结合积肥运动领导群众建造新居

    老墙换新墙　社员住新房
    威远结合积肥运动领导群众建造新居
    四川威远县农村原来约有30％的房屋破旧不堪，经常因倒塌而造成人畜伤亡的事件。每逢刮风下雨，有些农民不敢在屋里安心睡觉。另外，居住很分散，一家一户相隔很远，既占去不少土地，出工生产也不方便。威远县原来计划等几年以后再来解决这个问题。在这次经过社会主义教育和四十条纲要的鼓舞，广大农民为了争取实现亩产八百斤，热烈要求将一些十分破烂的房屋拆除，结合开展积肥运动修建居民点。各个农业社经过群众性的辩论，制定了规划，成立了专门的建房队和拆房队，边拆边建。他们提出的口号是：“老墙换新墙，互助建新房，社内多增产，社员住新房”。
    威远县各级党委紧密依靠群众，成功地解决了物资、劳力、技术的困难，做到了又省、又快、又多、又好。修房需用的材料，全部是从旧房上拆下来的，经过加工、调剂仍能使用。各地在修建中只是购买了一些钉子，每间房子约两斤钉子，合一元多钱。住上新房的农民，一户卖出一只鸡就够了。国家和农业社都没有花钱。
    这些房屋修建的规划，是从有利生产和适当照顾农民旧有习惯出发的。一般是以生产队为单位，十户左右结成一个居民点，位置比较适中。农民对这些房子非常满意，他们总结新建的居民点有八大好处：（1）坚固、耐用，人们不再怕风吹雨打。（2）灶房和猪圈隔开，卫生条件改善。（3）出工整齐、方便，能提高劳动效率。（4）节省大量土地。（5）开会、学习方便，不受天气时间限制。（6）便于举办托儿所、幼儿园、民校等公共福利事业。（7）供销社好来供应和收购物品。（8）对消灭四害有帮助。
    春节前后，全县有七千多户农民兴高采烈地搬入了新居。
