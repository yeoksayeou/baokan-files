    Industry and Commerce Advance Side by Side
    Wan Lilang
    In our country, the cooperative relationship between the industrial and commercial sectors is basically coordinated. However, in some regions and in some aspects, there are still some disputes. The industrial sector's opinion of the commercial sector is that they are insensitive to changing social needs, lack foresight, and the quantity of purchases fluctuates, which to a certain extent affects the industrial sector's improvement of technology and reduction of costs, making production unable to develop stably. The commercial sector's opinion of the industrial sector is that some enterprises emphasize quantity over quality, ignore the diversity of product varieties, patterns, and specifications, and bury themselves in production behind closed doors, ignoring market needs, resulting in increased production in the industrial sector and stockpiling in the commercial sector. As a result, these two sectors often have disputes when discussing production and sales plans, signing contracts, and accepting goods.
    Can these contradictions be resolved? Can the views of both parties be unified and advance together towards a common goal? The answer is yes.
    The interests of the industrial and commercial sectors are completely一致. We know that the fundamental problem of social development is the problem of production, the problem of constantly developing the productive forces. Therefore, both the industrial and commercial sectors must promote the development of production. At the same time, under the socialist system, the purpose of production is ultimately to meet the growing needs of the people. This is a common goal. If the commercial sector proceeds from a narrow economic accounting point of view, considering first whether it will lose money in everything it does, only calculating small accounts, and not considering how to better serve production and consumers, and not calculating the big picture politically, the result is often that it will not actively carry out things that are conducive to the development of production, thereby also harming the interests of consumers. On the other hand, if the industrial sector does not unite the completion of tasks with the satisfaction of needs, only seeking quantity and not quality, unwilling to change production to adapt to needs, and hoping to complete tasks easily, then the products produced will not be sold and can only cause waste to the state.
    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's resolution of the cooperative relationship between the industrial and commercial sectors through rectification is a good example. The Tianjin Municipal Committee, on the one hand, pointed out that the commercial sector must serve production (and also serve consumers, of course), ensure the purchase of industrial products, and do everything possible to organize sales; on the other hand, it also pointed out that the industrial sector must serve construction and consumers, and industrial production must do everything possible to meet the needs of the people, with both quantity and quality leaping forward together. Under the auspices of the Municipal Committee, the industrial and commercial sectors held meetings together for more than ten days, and both parties conducted self-criticisms against departmentalism. On the basis of gradually unified views, they jointly formulated a plan for a great leap forward in production this year. As a result, everyone felt comfortable, and their political, production, and mass perspectives were greatly strengthened compared to the past. Problems that could not be discussed in the past can now be solved by sitting down and negotiating, and leading cadres have also begun to meet directly to discuss and solve problems, unlike in the past when they sent "experts in buck-passing" for long-term negotiations.
    What Tianjin can do, other regions should certainly be able to do. We hope that the Party committees of all provinces and cities will also take up this matter like the Tianjin Municipal Committee.

    工商业并肩前进
    万里浪
    我国，工业部门和商业部门之间的协作关系基本上是协调的。但在某些地区、某些方面，却还存在着一些争执。工业部门对商业部门的意见是：他们对变化中的社会需要感觉迟钝，缺乏预见，收购数量时多时少，在一定程度上影响了工业部门改进技术和降低成本，使生产不能稳定地发展。商业部门对工业部门的意见是：某些企业重数量轻质量，忽视产品品种、花色、规格的多样性，闭门埋头生产，不问市场需要，结果是工业部门增产，商业部门积压。于是，这两个部门在商量产销计划、订立合同、验收商品的时候，常常发生争执。
    这些矛盾能不能解决呢？双方的观点能不能取得一致，朝着一个目标共同跃进呢？回答是肯定的。
    工业部门和商业部门的利益是完全一致的。我们知道，社会发展的根本问题，是生产问题，是不断发展生产力的问题。因此，工业部门和商业部门都要促进生产的发展。同时，在社会主义制度下，生产的目的归根到底是为了满足人民日益增长的需要。这是一个共同的目标。商业部门如果从狭隘的经济核算观点出发，每做一件事都首先考虑是否赔钱，只算小账，而不考虑如何更好地为生产和消费者服务，不从政治上算大账，结果往往就不去积极进行有利于发展生产的事情，从而也就损害了消费者的利益。另一方面，工业部门如果不把完成任务和满足需要统一起来，只求数量不求质量，不愿改变生产适应需要，希望轻松地完成任务，那么产品生产出来也是卖不出去，只能给国家造成浪费。
    中共天津市委通过整风来解决工业部门和商业部门的协作关系，是一个很好的范例。天津市委一方面指出商业部门必须为生产服务（当然同时也为消费者服务），保证收购工业产品，千方百计地组织推销；另一方面又指出工业部门必须为建设、为消费者服务，工业生产必须千方百计地做到合乎人民需要，数量和质量一同跃进。在市委主持下，工业部门和商业部门在一起开了十几天会，双方都进行了反对本位主义的检查，在观点逐步一致的基础上，共同制订了今年生产大跃进的计划。结果是大家都心情舒畅，政治观点、生产观点和群众观点比以前大大加强了。过去商量不通的问题，现在可以坐下来协商解决了，领导干部之间也开始直接见面商谈解决问题，不像过去那样互派“扯皮专家”作长期谈判了。
    像这样的事情，天津可以做到，想必其他地区一定也能够做到。我们希望各省、市党委也像天津市委一样，把这件事情抓起来。
