Chen County Special District Grasps Key to Increased Production
Strives for 10,000 Jin per Mu of Sweet Potatoes This Year

    (From Our Newspaper) The "New Hunan Daily" published a message on its front page on the 4th stating that Chen County Special District aims to become a "10,000 Jin Sweet Potato Special District" this year. The newspaper also published an editorial on this matter. The message states: Sweet potatoes (i.e., sweet potatoes) are high-yield grain crops. Last year, Chen County Special District had more than 710,000 mu of sweet potatoes, with a total output equivalent to more than 500 million jin of staple grains, accounting for 30% of the total grain output of the district. This year, it will be expanded to 900,000 mu, including 200,000 mu of autumn sweet potatoes. The requirement is an average yield of 10,000 jin per mu, of which 2% should reach 40,000 jin per mu, 5% should reach 30,000 jin per mu, and 15% to 20% should reach 20,000 jin per mu, with a total output of 9 billion jin, equivalent to 2.25 billion jin of rice, which is 300 million jin more than the total grain output of the entire special district in 1957.

    In order to achieve this leap forward goal, the Chen County Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the various counties have held sweet potato training classes. The entire special district is widely learning high-yield cultivation experience, training a total of more than 14,000 people. Five technical measures for increasing sweet potato production in 1958 have also been formulated: 1. Select superior varieties and fully implement warm-bed germination and seedling cultivation; 2. Deeply cultivate the soil, requiring a depth of one to two chi, and apply more than 600 dan of mixed fertilizer per mu; 3. Plant sweet potatoes early (start planting around the Beginning of Summer and finish by the Lesser Fullness), and pay attention to shallow planting; 4. Support vines with tree branches and cultivate and weed more than twice; 5. Prevent and control diseases and insect pests.

    The "New Hunan Daily" stated in its editorial: Sweet potatoes are one of the main grains in Hunan Province, second only to rice. In many places in the vast mountainous and hilly areas, sweet potatoes provide half a year's worth of food; even in areas that are abundant in rice, sweet potatoes are an important supplementary grain for the masses. In addition, sweet potatoes are also good feed for raising pigs and cattle, and are raw materials for the brewing, sugar making, and flour milling industries, with a wide range of uses. Appropriately expanding the planting area of sweet potatoes and greatly increasing the yield per unit area of dryland sweet potatoes is of great significance for enriching the people's food rations in urban and rural areas, developing the breeding industry on a large scale, and developing local agricultural product processing industries. To achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production in Hunan Province this year, and to achieve a total grain output of 28 billion jin to 30 billion jin per year, in addition to vigorously grasping the increase in rice production in paddy fields, we must also pay great attention to the production of dryland sweet potatoes, so that sweet potato production can also take a great leap forward.

    The editorial stated: The area of sweet potatoes planted in Hunan Province annually is about 7 million mu, and the average yield per mu of sweet potatoes in the province last year was only 1,200 jin, indicating a great potential for increased production. Last year, areas across the province saw yields of 10,000 jin or more on 15,000 mu or more. If the yield of 7 million mu of dryland sweet potatoes across the province is generally increased by one time, it will increase sweet potato production by 8 billion jin; if it is increased by two or three times, it will increase sweet potato production by 16 billion jin to 20 billion jin, and the increase in sweet potato production alone will achieve this year's overall grain production requirements. The editorial then pointed out that in the past, some places had a tendency to focus on rice (emphasizing rice is correct) and neglect the production of sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains in the development of grain production. This must be corrected this year, and we must strive for a great leap forward in sweet potato production.

### 郴县专区抓住了增产关键  今年争取亩产万斤甘薯

    郴县专区抓住了增产关键
    今年争取亩产万斤甘薯
    本报讯　4日“新湖南报”在第一版刊登了郴县专区今年要实现“万斤红薯专区”的消息，该报并为此发表了社论。消息说：红薯（即甘薯）是高产粮食作物，去年郴县专区红薯有七十一万多亩，总产量折合主粮达五亿多斤，占全区粮食总产量30％。今年将扩大到九十万亩，其中秋红薯二十万亩，要求平均亩产达一万斤，其中亩产四万斤的占2％，三万斤的占5％，二万斤的占15％到20％，总产量九十亿斤，折合稻谷二十二亿五千万斤，比1957年全专区粮食总产量还多三亿斤。
    为了实现这个跃进目标，中共郴县地委和各县都举办了红薯训练班，全专区普遍学习高额丰产的栽培经验，共训练了一万四千多人。并且制定了1958年红薯增产的五项技术措施：1、选用良种，全面推行温床催芽育苗；2、深挖土，要求深挖一尺到二尺，肥料每亩施混合肥六百担以上；3、提早插薯（立夏开始小满插完），并注意浅插；4、提藤铺树枝，中耕除草两次以上；5、防治病虫害。
    新湖南报在社论中说：红薯是湖南省仅次于稻谷的主要粮食之一。在广大山区和丘陵区许多地方，红薯是半年粮食；就是盛产水稻的地区，红薯也是群众的重要辅助粮食。此外，红薯还是养猪养牛的好饲料，又是酿酒、制糖、制粉工业的原料，用途很广。适当扩大红薯种植面积，大大提高旱土红薯单位面积产量，对于充裕城乡人民生活口粮，大规模发展饲养业，发展地方性农产品加工工业，均具有十分重大的意义。湖南省今年要实现农业生产大跃进，实现年产二百八十亿斤到三百亿斤的粮食总产量，除了大力抓水田稻谷增产外，同时要十分重视旱土红薯的生产，让红薯生产也来一个大跃进。
    社论说：湖南省常年种植红薯的面积约在七百万亩左右，去年全省红薯平均亩产量仅一千二百斤，增产的潜力很大。去年全省各地已出现万斤丰产亩一万五千亩以上。如果全省七百万亩旱土红薯普遍提高产量一倍就将增产八十亿斤红薯；如果提高到两三倍，就将增产红薯一百六十亿斤到二百多亿斤，仅红薯一项增产就将实现今年粮食总的增产要求。社论接着指出，过去有些地方在发展粮食生产中有偏重稻谷（重视稻谷是对的）、忽视红薯杂粮生产的思想，今年必须改正，力争红薯生产也来个大跃进。
