Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. The officers and soldiers of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea to return home have recently carried various sacrificial offerings and gone to the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery near their駐地 to hold their final memorial ceremony before returning home. The leaders of the troops and the vast number of officers and soldiers mourned silently for a long time at the martyrs' tombs, presented wreaths to the martyrs, planted Masson pines and cedars in front of the martyrs' tombs, and added new soil to the martyrs' tombs. They swore to the martyrs: "We will always be loyal to the people and to the cause of peace for mankind. If the enemy dares to launch another war of aggression in Korea, as long as the Korean government and people need us, we will immediately return and heroically strike the aggressors as you did in your lifetime."
