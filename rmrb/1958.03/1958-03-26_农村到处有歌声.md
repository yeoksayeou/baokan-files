Songs Everywhere in the Countryside

The socialist singing movement has been launched successively in various parts of Shanxi. The singing movement demonstrates the new look of the people's cultural life in the Great Leap Forward in production; at the same time, it encourages the masses to invest themselves in socialist production labor with greater enthusiasm.

In the Jinan area, where the movement started earlier, the Hanping Township Central Club in Wanrong County organized a socialist choir of more than 80 people. They have learned eight new songs and are now teaching them everywhere. In Jiuzhuang Township, Xiangyuan County, all men, women, and children participated in this singing activity, and they have learned three songs including "Socialism is Good." Yanggao County recently held a street carnival song event with more than 300 people, which aroused the enthusiasm of many people for singing. Lishan County held small concerts at the county, township, and town levels. In many rural areas of Xiyang, Huguan, Licheng and other counties, commune members sing while working in the fields and on water conservancy construction sites, creating a joyful scene of production everywhere. In the cities, many amateur theater troupes and music groups in factories and mines, schools, etc. are actively practicing singing and teaching new songs to the masses. Taiyuan, Datong and other cities have also held concerts.

    农村到处有歌声
    社会主义歌唱运动已经在山西各地陆续展开。歌唱运动表现了生产大跃进中人民群众文化生活的新面貌；同时鼓舞了群众更热情地投入社会主义生产劳动。
    在运动展开较早的晋南地区，万荣县汉萍乡中心俱乐部组织了一支八十多人的社会主义合唱队，已经学会八支新歌，目前正在到处教唱。襄垣县九庄乡全乡男女老少都参加了这种唱歌活动，已经学会“社会主义好”等三首歌曲。阳高县最近举行了三百多人的街头化装歌唱，鼓起了不少群众唱歌的劲头。离山县以县、乡、镇为单位，分别举行了小型演唱会。在昔阳、壶关、黎城等县的不少农村里，社员们在田间和水利工地上，一边劳动，一边唱歌，到处是一片欢乐的生产情景。在城市里，许多厂矿、学校的业余剧团、音乐小组等，正在积极练唱和给群众教唱新歌曲，太原、大同等市还分别举行了音乐会演。
