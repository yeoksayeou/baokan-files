Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 25th: A conference of more than 2,000 representatives of 130,000 transferred cadres from Jiangsu Province was held in Nanjing from the 20th to the 25th. The conference proposed launching a socialist competition among the transferred cadres in the province to "compare labor training, compare ideological remolding, compare high yields, compare relationships with the masses, and compare social work."

Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, analyzed the current situation of the socialist Great Leap Forward at the meeting. He called on the transferred cadres to go all out and strive for the top in the wave of the Great Leap Forward, to be promoters and progressives in the true sense of the word, and to blaze their own path of being both red and expert through labor training.

The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that special attention should be paid to not becoming arrogant simply because they have achieved certain results in labor training and learned some production skills in the past period. Everyone also corrected their views on learning. They pointed out that the view that only reading big books behind closed doors counts as learning is incorrect, and that one should learn from labor; doing is learning.

The attending representatives widely exchanged experiences in labor training and ideological remolding, and a wave of competition was set off. All the representatives from the Suzhou Special District proposed to all the transferred cadres in the province to resolve to learn the fine qualities of the working people and cultivate the feelings of the working people in the long-term labor training in the future. Everyone should formulate progress plans, conduct regular evaluations and inspections, and ensure that they are in the countryside with their hearts in the countryside. Everyone should strive to be advanced and compare their energy, to be red in the countryside and expert in the countryside. They also proposed specific indicators for "seven comparisons" in their initiative, such as comparing who does labor well, who has high yields, who has good ideological remolding, and who has good technological innovation. All the representatives enthusiastically responded to the initiative of the representatives from the Suzhou Special District and challenged each other at the meeting. Wang Qinghan, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, who was transferred to Siyang County, guaranteed to cultivate a high-yield cotton field of 1.6 mu well. The representatives from Jintan County guaranteed that each person would work more than 250 days a year, and the representatives from Shuyang County immediately proposed 320 days.

At the meeting, the representatives also exchanged the gains and experiences they had gained from participating in labor for more than three months. After more than three months of labor training, their labor ability has been greatly enhanced, and they have basically learned various farm work in the winter production campaign. Some people have also learned plowing, harrowing, and various household chores. Many people are now able to carry heavy loads of hundreds of catties, and many people have also been rated as labor models by townships and communes. Their ideological feelings have also changed, their political awareness has improved compared to before, their class stand has become clearer than before, and their close feelings with the working people have been strengthened. Those among them who originally had technical skills in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, veterinary medicine, and sanitation have brought their expertise into play in the countryside. They have also helped cooperatives to clear accounts, run people's schools, and publicize the Party's various policies to the members, becoming people trusted by the members.

    人在农村　心在农村　红在农村　专在农村
    江苏下放干部提出竞赛倡议
    据新华社南京25日电　江苏省十三万名下放干部的代表共两千多人，20日到25日在南京举行会议，会议倡议在全省下放干部中展开“比劳动锻炼，比思想改造，比高额丰产，比群众关系，比社会工作”的社会主义竞赛。
    中共江苏省委书记刘顺元在会上分析了当前社会主义大跃进的形势，号召下放干部在大跃进的浪潮中，鼓足干劲，力争上游，做个名副其实的促进派、跃进派，在劳动锻炼中开拓出自己又红又专的道路。
    参加会议的代表们一致认为，要特别注意不能因为过去一个时期劳动锻炼有了一定成绩，学会了一些生产上的本领就骄傲起来。大家还端正了对学习的看法，他们指出，有些人认为只有关门读大本书才算学习的看法是不对的，应该从劳动中学习，干就是学。
    到会代表广泛地交流了劳动锻炼和思想改造等方面的经验，并且掀起了竞赛热潮。苏州专区的全体代表向全省下放干部提出决心在今后长期的劳动锻炼中，学习劳动人民的优良品质，培养劳动人民的思想感情，人人订进步规划，定期评比检查，保证人在农村，心在农村，人人争先进，个个比干劲，在农村里红，在农村里专。他们在倡议中还提出了比谁劳动好，比谁产量高，比谁思想改造好，比谁技术革新好等“七比”的具体指标。全体代表热烈地响应苏州专区代表的倡议，在会上互相挑战应战。下放在泗阳县的团省委副书记王庆汉保证种好一亩六分棉花丰产田。金坛县代表保证每人全年出勤二百五十天以上，沭阳县代表马上提出三百二十天。
    会上，代表们还交流了三个多月来参加劳动的收获和体会。他们经过三个多月的劳动锻炼，劳动能力大大增强，基本上学会了冬季生产运动中的各项农活，有些人还学会了耕田、耙地和各项家务劳动。很多人现在已经能挑百十斤的重担，许多人还被乡、社评为劳动模范。他们的思想感情上也起了变化，政治觉悟比以前提高，阶级立场比以前明确，加强了和劳动人民的亲密感情。他们中原有农业、林业、水利、兽医、卫生等方面技术的人，在农村中发挥了他们的特长。他们还帮助合作社清理账目、开办民校，向社员宣传党的各项政策，成为受到社员信赖的人。
