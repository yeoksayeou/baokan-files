    Water Runs Uphill
    Si Su
Who says the water of the slender West Lake only serves the light swaying of painted boats? Now it passes through Ping Shan Hall and flies onto Shu Hill, irrigating the long-term parched land! Who says the slender West Lake in May only hears pastoral songs? Now motors roar, and waterfalls fly from the foot of the mountain to the top!
                (Yangzhou, Jiangsu)

    水奔高处流
    思苏谁说瘦西湖的水，只供那一只只的画舫轻荡？如今它穿过平山堂，飞上蜀冈，把长年干裂的土地灌溉上！谁说五月的瘦西湖，只听到牧歌轻唱？如今马达轰鸣，瀑布从山下飞到山上！
                （江苏扬州）
