Mobile Factories Go to the Countryside and Mountains
Hunan Will Establish Mobile Rice Processing Plants and Mountain Mobile Sawmills

    (This newspaper dispatch) Mobile factories going to the countryside and mountains is a good way to serve agriculture and forestry. Xiangtan Special District, Hunan Province, has decided to establish 130 mobile rice processing plants starting in May of this year to process grain for farmers in the countryside. This will not only facilitate farmers and save a lot of rural labor, but also increase the production of more pig feed. According to experimental estimates: 130 mobile rice processing plants, calculated on the basis of ten months of mobile processing time throughout the year, can process more than 624 million catties of rice for farmers, saving more than 2.496 million workdays, and at the same time increase the production of more than 174.72 million catties of mixed bran, which can solve the feed supply for more than 191,500 pigs for one year.
    The characteristics of the mobile rice processing plant are: simple equipment, easy operation, flexible mobility, high output, and low cost. Each mobile rice processing plant only needs one Cantonese-style No. 3 rice machine. As long as one person uses a flatbed cart to transport it, it can move on relatively wide rural roads. When formally producing, the agricultural cooperative's water pump motor can be used for transmission to carry out processing. Each 100 catties of rice can process 72 catties of standard grade two rice and 28 catties of mixed bran. Farmers only need to pay a processing fee of about 2.5 jiao per 100 catties of rice, and all the rice and mixed bran belong to the farmers. During operation, only one person is needed to operate the rice machine and one person to operate the power, and 3,800 catties of rice can be processed per hour.
    In order to overcome the difficulty of transporting timber when logging in remote areas and reduce the labor intensity of manual operation, the forest industry department of Hunan Province has decided to establish mobile sawmills in the mountains.
    In the Hunan area, many forest areas are small and not easy to utilize with machinery. The labor intensity is high, and transportation is very difficult. In the past, the production of timber in these small forest areas was entirely manual, with low efficiency and high costs. In the first half of last year, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau established a pilot mobile sawmill in Dongjiang, Zixing County. Each circular saw can produce more than 120 railway sleepers and more than 300 boards per day, which is equivalent to the highest production volume of forty workers, and the cost is reduced by 50% compared to manual labor.
    The mobile sawmill only uses a car engine and two circular saw blades. The saw table, cross shaft and power bracket are all made of wood. The factory building is built from local materials, using fir bark and self-made wooden boards. This is suitable for mountainous conditions and easy to disassemble and move. The entire investment for such a mobile sawmill is within 10,000 yuan. The mobile sawmill turns raw logs into finished products, which are easy to transport out. Workers use bamboo and wood chutes to transport timber, overcoming the phenomenon of carrying it on their shoulders.

    为农业和林业服务
    流动工厂下乡上山
    湖南将建立流动加工米厂和山间流动制材厂
    本报讯　流动工厂下乡上山，是为农业和林业服务的好办法。湖南省湘潭专区决定从今年5月起建立一百三十个流动加工米厂，下乡为农民加工粮食。这样不仅便利农民，节省农村大量劳动力，而且可以增产更多的生猪饲料。根据试验情况估计：一百三十个流动加工米厂，全年以十个月流动加工时间计算，可代农民加工稻谷六亿二千四百多万斤，节省二百四十九万六千多个劳动日，同时能增产统糠一亿七千四百七十二万余斤，可解决十九万一千五百多头猪一年的饲料供应问题。
    流动加工米厂的特点是：设备简单，操作容易，流动灵活，产量高，成本低。每个流动加工米厂只需一台广式三号米机，只要一个人用一部板车拖运，就可以在较宽的乡村道路上流动，正式生产时利用农业社抽水机马达传动，就可以进行加工。每百斤稻谷，可加工标准二机米七十二斤，统糠二十八斤。每百斤谷，农民只需付加工费二角五分左右，大米、统糠全部归农民。操作时只需一人掌握米机，一人操作动力，每小时可加工稻谷三千八百斤。
    湖南省森林工业部门为了克服偏远地区砍伐木材时运输困难和减轻手工操作的劳动强度，决定建立山间流动制材厂。
    湖南地区森林面积有很多是小块的，不便于利用机械，劳动强度大，运输很困难。过去，这些小块林区生产木材，全部是手工操作，效率低、成本高。去年上半年，湖南省森林工业局在资兴县东江建立了一个试验性的山间流动制材厂。每天每个圆锯能制枕木一百二十根、板材三百块以上，相当四十个工人最高生产量，成本比手工要降低50％。
    流动制材厂只用一部汽车引擎和两个圆锯片，锯台、过轴与动力支架，全部是木质结构。厂房是就地取材，利用杉皮和自己制出来的木板搭盖起来的。这样适合山区条件，便于拆卸与流动。这样一个流动制材厂，整个投资在一万元以内。流动制材厂把原条制成成品，容易运出来。工人们利用竹木滑道运木材，克服了肩挑的现象。
