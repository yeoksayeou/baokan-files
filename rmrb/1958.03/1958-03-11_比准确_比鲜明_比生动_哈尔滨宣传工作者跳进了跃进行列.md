Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 10th: The Harbin Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department convened a Propaganda Work Great Leap Forward Conference on the 8th.

More than 1,500 propaganda workers attending the meeting proposed that, in addition to eliminating official airs, listlessness, extravagance, pride, and squeamishness, propaganda workers should also eliminate old-fashioned thinking, bookishness, and stereotyped writing. They should enhance initiative, accuracy, clarity, vividness, and mass character to bring about a great leap forward in propaganda work.

A great leap forward competition in propaganda work was launched at the meeting. Propaganda workers from seven factories, including Harbin Bearing Factory, Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, and First Machinery Factory, took the lead in proposing a joint initiative to challenge all units in the city to compete in the accuracy, clarity, and vividness of propaganda work. They proposed the working methods of seizing embryonic tendencies, seizing trends, seizing advanced elements, seizing opportunities, and grasping the key issues in propaganda work. Representatives from all units attending the meeting immediately responded to this initiative.

    比准确　比鲜明　比生动
    哈尔滨宣传工作者跳进了跃进行列
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　中共哈尔滨市委宣传部8日召开了宣传工作跃进大会。
    到会的一千五百多宣传工作者提出，宣传工作者除了要扫除官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气以外，还要扫掉老头子气、书呆子气和八股气，增强主动性、准确性、鲜明性、生动性和群众性，使宣传工作来个大跃进。
    会上掀起了宣传工作跃进大竞赛。哈尔滨轴承厂、机车车辆修理厂、量具刃具厂、第一机械厂等七个工厂宣传工作者首先提出联合倡议，向全市各单位挑战，比宣传工作的准确性、鲜明性和生动性。他们提出，在宣传工作中要抓萌芽、抓倾向、抓先进、抓时机、抓纲的工作方法。到会的各单位代表立即响应了这个倡议。
