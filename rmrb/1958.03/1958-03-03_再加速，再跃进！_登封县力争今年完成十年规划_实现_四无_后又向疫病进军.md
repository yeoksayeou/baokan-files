Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 2nd. Dengfeng County, Henan Province, on the basis of an all-round great leap forward in various tasks, has recently put forward a new requirement of "completing the ten-year plan in one year." The county aims to basically achieve water conservancy and afforestation this year, with per-mu yield reaching 600 jin and per-mu fertilizer application reaching 30,000 jin. Local industry will also catch up with or exceed the county's total agricultural output value within three years.

Currently, more than 200,000 people in Dengfeng County are working daily on repairing reservoirs, treating mountain slopes, eliminating the four pests, accumulating fertilizer, eliminating illiteracy, and strengthening wheat field management. Most of the county's 430,000 mu of wheat fields have been shallow-plowed twice and top-dressed twice. Due to the large amount of fertilizer accumulated this year, an average of nearly 20,000 jin of fertilizer has been applied to each mu of wheat field. At present, the wheat seedlings have emerged two or three inches, and the 430,000 mu of wheat fields are lush green.

In order to adapt to the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, all aspects of the county are carrying out red flag competitions and regular evaluations of models. Competition systems have been established between townships, between communes, and between teams. The working methods of visiting and evaluating, and catching up with the advanced have also been widely promoted.

Special dispatch from our newspaper in Zhengzhou on the 2nd. After four months of hard work by the 380,000 people of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, the county has basically eliminated the four pests by the end of February, achieving the "Four-Without" county ahead of schedule. At present, the streets and alleys of all villages and towns in the county are swept clean, there are no broken bricks or rubble on the roads, there is no garbage in the courtyards, and toilets, wells, and kitchens have been generally improved. The walls of the living rooms are clean, with no bird nests or rat holes. The atmosphere of everyone paying attention to hygiene and every household loving cleanliness has begun to take shape, and a new atmosphere of the new society is emerging everywhere.

On the morning of February 28, the county held a broadcast rally to celebrate the achievement of "Four-Without" county. More than 200,000 cadres and people listened to the broadcast and were greatly encouraged. At present, the county is carrying out the "Six Investigations and Six Comparisons" movement between townships, between communes, between teams, and between households (investigating hygiene, comparing production; investigating the results of the four pests elimination campaign, comparing cleanliness; investigating the seven improvements, comparing fertilizer accumulation; investigating the health of people and livestock, comparing the reduction of diseases; investigating hygiene systems, comparing persistence; investigating diligence and thrift in running hygiene undertakings, comparing inventions and creations), guiding the four pests elimination movement towards eliminating diseases and improving the health of people and livestock.

    再加速，再跃进！
    登封县力争今年完成十年规划
    实现“四无”后又向疫病进军
    据新华社郑州2日电　河南省登封县在各项工作全面大跃进的基础上，最近又提出“十年规划、一年完成”的新的要求。全县要在今年基本实现水利化和绿化，每亩产量达到六百斤，每亩施肥料三万斤。地方工业也将在三年内赶上或超过全县农业生产总产值。
    登封县目前每天有二十多万群众分别在修水库、治山坡、除四害、积肥、扫盲和加强麦田管理工作。全县四十三万亩麦田，大部分都浅锄了两遍，施了两次追肥，由于今年肥料积得多，平均每亩麦田已施到近二万斤肥料。目前，麦苗已出土二、三寸，四十三万亩麦田上一片葱郁。
    为了适应大跃进的高潮形势，全县各个方面正在开展红旗竞赛和定期评比模范。乡与乡、社与社、队与队都建立了竞赛制度。参观评比、赶先进的工作方法也普遍得到推广。
    本报郑州2日专电　河南省登封县三十八万人民经过四个月苦战，全县已在2月底基本上歼灭四害，提前实现“四无”县。现在全县各村镇的大街小巷都打扫得干干净净，路上不见破砖碎石，院内没有垃圾，厕所、水井、厨房普遍改良，住室四壁清洁不见雀窝鼠洞。人人讲卫生、户户爱清洁的风气已开始形成，到处呈现出新社会的新气象。
    2月28日上午，全县举行了庆祝实现“四无”县的广播大会，二十多万干部和群众收听广播后受到了极大的鼓舞。目前全县正在开展乡与乡、社与社、队与队、户与户的“六查六比”运动（查卫生、比生产，查除四害战果、比清洁，查七改良、比积肥，查人畜健壮、比疾病减少，查卫生制度、比坚持经常，查勤俭办卫生事业、比发明创造），将除四害运动引向消灭疾病、增进人畜健壮的方面去。
