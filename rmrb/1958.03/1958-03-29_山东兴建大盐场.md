Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 28th. A large-scale sea saltworks will be built in Yangkou, Shandong Province. The design and surveying of the saltworks have been basically completed, and preparations for construction are currently underway. Groundbreaking is scheduled for the second half of this year.

The saltworks are located near Bohai Bay, with a total production area of 175 square kilometers. In a normal year, it can produce 1.3 million tons of salt annually, which is equivalent to about twice the total output of the current ten saltworks in the province. The large amount of bittern leached out during salt production can also be used to extract chemical raw materials such as potassium chloride, bromine, and anhydrous sodium nitrate.
