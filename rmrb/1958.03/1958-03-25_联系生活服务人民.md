    Connecting with Life, Serving the People
    The Vietnam Artists Association recently published a colored album, which features exquisite works of art such as sculptures and paintings by modern Vietnamese artists. These works were mostly created after the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945. In the war against foreign invaders, the artists fought side by side with the soldiers, creating excellent works. For example, paintings such as "Guerrillas Chasing the Enemy," "Shooting Practice," and "Spring Festival in the Trenches of Dien Bien Phu" fully depict the heroic spirit of the Vietnamese people's struggle.
    The war is over. The people of northern Vietnam are engaged in peaceful labor on free land. The vigorous construction work and the people's new life have become the themes of the artists' creations. The three watercolor paintings "Mending Fishing Nets," "People's Literacy Class" (see picture below), and "The Fruits of Land Reform Struggle - Buffalo" and the lacquer painting "Drawing Water" are all deeply impressive. The painter Nguyen Bich expresses the people's desire for national reunification through a scene of several young women from the north and south conversing intimately. A group of sculptures "Worker, Peasant, Soldier" and some paintings depicting Vietnamese national characteristics and natural scenery in the album are also fresh and moving. (Image attached)

    越南艺术家协会最近出版了一部彩色画册，集中了越南现代艺术家的雕塑、绘画等精美艺术作品，这些作品大都是1945年越南民主共和国成立以后创作的。在反对外国侵略者的战争中，艺术家们同战士一起并肩作战，创造了优秀的作品。例如，“游击队员追击敌人”，“射击练习”，“奠边府炮壕里的春节”等画，充分描写出越南人民斗争的英雄气概。
    战争结束了。越南北部人民在自由的土地上进行和平的劳动。如火如荼的建设工作和人们的新生活成为艺术家的创作主题。“补鱼网”，“民众识字班”（见下图），“土改斗争果实水牛”这三幅水彩画和漆画“舀水”都给人以深刻的印象。画家阮碧通过南北两部的几个青年妇女在一起亲切交谈的画面，表达了人民要求祖国统一的热望。画册里的一组雕塑“工农兵”和一些描写越南民族特色和自然风物的画也很清新动人。（附图片）
