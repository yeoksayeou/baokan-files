Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 12th: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, Czechoslovak Republic President and First Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee Novotny said in an interview with reporters that the Czechoslovak government has always unreservedly supported the proposition of resolving all international disputes through negotiations. If Czechoslovakia is invited to participate in a high-level meeting or a preparatory meeting of foreign ministers, it will accept the invitation and make every effort to contribute to the greatest possible success of the talks.

Novotny made these remarks in response to questions raised by reporters from the Czechoslovak News Agency and "Red Right Newspaper." The reporters first asked Novotny to comment on Czechoslovakia's attitude towards convening the two aforementioned meetings.

Novotny said that the preliminary meeting of foreign ministers should be limited to drafting an agenda on the most important issues and other organizational matters. As for the content of all issues included on the agenda, it should be discussed by the participants of the high-level meeting. They not only have broader authority, but it can also be expected that the high-level meeting will be able to resolve more issues than the meeting of foreign ministers in other respects.

The reporter then asked President Novotny for his views on the European public opinion's reaction to the Polish plan to establish a nuclear-free zone.

Novotny replied that after Poland proposed this plan last October, we immediately expressed our full support, and other socialist countries also expressed their support. It is only natural that this plan has received such a positive response from the European public. I believe that the main advantage of this plan is that it can quickly achieve its goals, and that its implementation undoubtedly does not require complicated supervision measures; this plan only specifically raises the issue of eliminating nuclear weapons, and the solution to the next steps in disarmament will be placed in future negotiations. This plan is of great significance for the peaceful development of participating countries and their neighboring countries.

Novotny said that the Polish plan stipulates that the participants in this plan are the two Germanys, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Among these four countries, three have already expressed their willingness to undertake the corresponding obligations, and now we are just waiting for the decision of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. Unfortunately, to this day, the West German government does not seem to fully appreciate the importance of this plan. Novotny emphasized that it is difficult to understand why a proposal that is acceptable to the three participating countries of the Warsaw Pact cannot be accepted by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

So far, the only major power that has expressed its willingness to undertake the corresponding obligations is the Soviet Union, but this is only the beginning, and I think we can be optimistic about the prospects of this plan. Because the plan to establish a nuclear-free zone has great practical significance and can serve as the first step towards disarmament, I hope it will be realized.

The reporter asked Novotny to explain his views on the U.S. government's attempt to include the so-called Eastern European question on the agenda of the highest-level meeting.

Novotny said that, regrettably, according to the official U.S. documents on preparing for the highest-level meeting, the U.S. government does not seem to be focusing on solving the main problems in the current world situation. World public opinion urgently demands the points contained in the Soviet proposal for the meeting agenda, which are: the demand to stop nuclear weapons testing, the obligation of major powers to abandon weapons of mass destruction, and the proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Europe. However, the U.S. government is doing the opposite, insisting on giving priority to issues such as the "unanimity" principle of the major powers in the United Nations Security Council and the "ambitions of international communism." The so-called Eastern European question is also included in the "problems" deliberately created by the United States. I think that, compared to the real problems, the provocativeness of this "problem" is more obvious than anything else.

The U.S. government's raising of the "Eastern European question" shows that it is adopting an attitude of complete disregard for the sovereignty of the countries in this region. Of course, this U.S. attitude is completely contrary to reality.

Some people in the United States do not like the fact that we have eliminated capitalism, but despite this, there is still an American embassy in Prague. This shows that the U.S. government recognizes that a Czechoslovakia without capitalists exists, and everyone can prove that this country is developing very well without them.

If it is noted that there are no "non-sovereign countries" in Eastern Europe, then the U.S. proposal should be seen as a clumsy attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. I cannot imagine that any Eastern European country would agree to discuss such issues. At least Czechoslovakia resolutely refuses. Novotny said that fabricating such superfluous and artificial "problems" will not contribute to the success of the high-level meeting in the slightest.

### 诺沃提尼总统对记者表示  捷愿意参加首脑或外长会议  美国提出“东欧国家问题”是妄图干涉这些国家

    诺沃提尼总统对记者表示
    捷愿意参加首脑或外长会议
    美国提出“东欧国家问题”是妄图干涉这些国家
    新华社布拉格12日电  据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼在对记者谈话时说，捷克斯洛伐克政府一向无保留地支持通过谈判方式解决一切国际争端的主张。如果捷克斯洛伐克被邀请参加高级会议或者外交部长的筹备会议，它将接受这项邀请，并且尽一切努力为使会谈取得最大成就而作出贡献。
    诺沃提尼是在回答捷克斯洛伐克通讯社和“红色权利报”记者提出的问题时说这番话的。记者们首先请诺沃提尼谈谈捷克斯洛伐克对召开上述两个会议的态度。
    诺沃提尼说，外交部长的预先会晤应该限于就最重要问题和其他组织问题拟定议程。至于一切列入议程的问题的内容，应该由高级会议参加者来讨论。他们不仅有更广泛的权限，而且可以期望高级会议在其他方面能够解决的问题要比外交部长会议为多。
    记者接着问到诺沃提尼总统对于欧洲舆论对波兰建立无原子地区计划的反应的看法。
    诺沃提尼回答说，在波兰去年10月提出这个计划以后，我们马上表示完全支持，其他社会主义国家也表示支持，这个计划得到欧洲广大公众那么积极的反应是理所当然的。我认为，这个计划的主要优点就在于它能够很快地实现它的目的，也在于它的实现无疑不需要有复杂的监督措施；这个计划仅只具体地提出消除原子武器问题，而有关裁军方面的下一步问题的解决将放到以后的谈判中去。这个计划对参加国以及同他们相邻国家的和平发展都具有重大意义。
    诺沃提尼说，波兰计划规定参加这个计划的有两个德国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克。在这四个国家中，已经有三个国家表示愿意承担相应的义务，现在就只等德意志联邦共和国政府的决定了。遗憾的是，直到今天西德政府好像还对这个计划的重要性估计不足。诺沃提尼强调说，为什么华沙条约的三个参加国可以接受的建议却不能为北大西洋公约组织的一个成员国所接受呢，这是难以令人理解的。
    直到目前为止，大国中表示愿意承担相应义务的还只有苏联，但这只是开始，我想，还可以乐观地展望这个计划的前景。由于建立无原子区的计划具有重大实际意义，并且可以作为走向裁军道路上的第一步，我希望它会得到实现。
    记者要求诺沃提尼说明他对美国政府力图把所谓东欧国家问题列入最高级会议议程中去这一步骤的看法。
    诺沃提尼说，很遗憾，根据美国有关准备最高级会议的官方文件来看，美国政府好像没有把注意力放到解决当前世界局势中的主要问题上。世界舆论的迫切要求就是苏联关于会议议程的建议中所包含的那几点，这就是：要求停止试验核武器、大国承担放弃大规模毁灭性武器的义务、建立欧洲无原子武器区的建议等。但是美国政府却与此相反，硬把联合国安全理事会中大国“一致”原则、“国际共产主义的野心”诸如此类的问题提到首要地位。所谓东欧国家问题也包括在美国故意制造出来的“问题”之中。我想，与真正的问题相比，这个“问题”的挑衅性比什么都要明显。
    美国政府提出“东欧国家问题”，表明它对这一地区国家所采取的是完全无视这些国家主权的态度。当然，美国的这种态度同现实是完全矛盾的。
    美国的某些人士不喜欢我们消除了资本主义这件事，但尽管如此，在布拉格还有美国的大使馆。这说明美国政府承认，没有资本家的捷克斯洛伐克是存在的，而且每一个人都可以证明，没有他们这个国家发展得非常好。
    如果注意到东欧不存在任何“没有主权的国家”，那么美国的建议就应当看作是干涉我们这些国家内政的拙劣企图。我不能设想，会有哪个东欧国家同意讨论这类问题。至少捷克斯洛伐克是坚决地拒绝的。诺沃提尼说，捏造这类多余的人为的“问题”丝毫也不能促使高级会议成功。
