    Water Mill Converted into Power Station
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 20th - The first power station in the Qinghai Plateau converted from a water mill has been completed in Yangjiazhai Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Xining. The entire set of equipment cost only a little over four thousand yuan.
    There are about five thousand water mills in rural Qinghai, averaging two per agricultural cooperative. The streams utilized by water mills are generally steep and have rapid currents, making them suitable for converting into small power stations. Agricultural cooperatives are extremely interested in converting water mills into power stations and are actively raising funds for construction and requesting the allocation of power generation machinery and guidance on conversion techniques. Huangzhong County, where Tibetan, Han, and Hui farmers live in mixed communities, has requested the conversion of one hundred and sixty-three this year alone. The industrial and water conservancy departments of Qinghai Province are preparing to make their best efforts to meet the demands of the various ethnic farmers.

    水磨改电站
    新华社西宁20日电　青海高原上第一座用水磨改装的电站，已经在西宁郊区杨家寨农业社建成。全套设备只花四千多元。
    青海农村约有五千座水磨，平均每个农业社有两座。水磨利用的溪流一般都坡陡水急，适宜于改装小型电站。各农业社对于水磨改装电站感到极大兴趣，纷纷筹集建站资金，要求配购发电机器和指导改装技术。藏、汉、回族农民杂居的湟中县，今年就要求改装一百六十三座。青海省工业部门和水利部门，准备尽最大努力满足各族农民的要求。
