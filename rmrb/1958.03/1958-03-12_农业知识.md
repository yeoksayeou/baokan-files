    Oven Seedling Raising Method
    This method was devised by members of the Fangshui well Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Yibin City, who absorbed the experience of vegetable farmers in raising vegetable seedlings in winter and spring. They used bamboo strips to weave a bamboo box six feet high, four to six feet long, and two feet wide, with two layers of bottom in the middle. The box is coated with cow dung and has a door on the side. When raising seedlings, bamboo sieves are used to spread rice straw, and then four to five inches of dry cow dung are scattered on top. The rice seeds are then scattered, watered, and another layer of dry cow dung is scattered on top. The box is then placed in the upper layer of the oven, and charcoal is burned in the lower layer to heat it, keeping the temperature between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius. Using this method, the seeds can germinate in 24 hours, and after two or three days, the seedlings will grow more than an inch and can be moved out during the day to be exposed to the sun. The seedling raising period is only seven to ten days.
    Soil Hotbed Seedling Raising Method
    This was created by the Hongba Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Yibin City.
    This cooperative sowed seeds on February 11 and transplanted seedlings on February 26, with a seedling raising time of only thirteen days. The method is to select a good hotbed site (dry, sunny place), first lay half a foot of rice straw, then one foot of green manure, add half a foot of dry cow dung and fertile mud on top, sprinkle with manure water, then sow the seeds, sprinkle with fine soil, and cover with rice straw. The fermentation of these accumulated materials can generate a temperature of more than 20 degrees Celsius, so the seedlings grow rapidly.
    Accumulation Rapid Seedling Raising Method
    This was created by the Yibin Special District Farm using the principle of composting. The rice seeds are sown in the soil covered with more than three inches of loose soil on the compost of three to four feet thick sugarcane peel. The fermentation temperature of the compost can keep the compost surface at about 20 degrees Celsius. The rice seeds soaked for 24 hours are sown, and they emerge from the soil in two or three days, and can be transplanted in thirteen to fifteen days. This compost-made hotbed, like the hotbed of the Hongba Agricultural Cooperative, can be large or small according to the needs of the terrain.

    烘箱育秧法
    这种办法是宜宾市郊区方水井农业社社员们吸收了菜农冬春两季育菜秧的经验想出的。他们用竹条编成六尺高、四尺到六尺长、二尺宽中有两层底的竹箱，箱外涂上牛粪，侧面有门。育秧时，用竹筛铺上稻草，上面撒四寸到五寸干牛粪，将稻种撒下，淋水，再撒上一层干牛粪，放进烘箱上层，在下层烧炭加热，使温度控制在二十五度到三十度之间。使用这种办法，二十四小时就能发芽，两三天后秧苗就长一寸多，可以白天移出，在阳光下曝晒。育秧期只要七天到十天。
    土温床育秧法
    这是宜宾市郊区红坝农业社创造的。
    这个社2月11日播种，2月26日就栽秧，育秧时间只有十三天。办法是选好温床地（干燥、向阳地方）后，先铺半尺厚的稻草，再铺一尺厚青肥，上面加半尺厚的干牛粪和肥泥，淋上粪水后撒种，撒上细土，盖上稻草。这些堆积物的发酵能产生二十度以上的温度，秧苗因而迅速生长。
    堆积快速育秧法
    这是宜宾专区农场利用堆肥的原理创造的。在三、四尺厚的甘蔗皮的堆肥上，盖了三寸多厚的松土，稻种就撒在土里。堆肥发酵的温度能使堆肥表面经常保持二十度左右。把泡过二十四小时的谷种撒下，两三天出土，十三到十五天就可栽插。这种堆肥做的温床，同红坝农业社的温床一样，根据地形需要，面积可大可小。
