Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. The workers of the North Level Tunnel of Chongqing Zhongliangshan Coal Mine created a new national record of 210.5 meters for level tunnel excavation in the coal mine system in February. This record surpassed the national record of 204 meters per month created by the South Level Tunnel of Zhongliangshan in August 1956. When the South Level Tunnel of Zhongliangshan Coal Mine created the national record in August 1956, there were thirty-one working days, while the North Level Tunnel had only twenty-seven actual working days in February this year.

The new record created by the North Level Tunnel of Zhongliangshan Coal Mine is inseparable from the vigorous efforts of the site leading cadres to overcome bureaucracy. Before the third quarter of last year, this site had failed to complete the state plan for nine consecutive months. At that time, the site director was divorced from the masses, political and ideological work was weak, construction management was chaotic, labor discipline was lax, and the attendance rate only reached about 70%. In the rectification movement, in addition to making a public self-criticism among the masses, the site director often went deep into the masses to understand the situation, talked with the workers, and consulted with everyone when things arose, thereby greatly encouraging the creativity of the workers.

### 官风倒　士气升  中梁山煤矿创全国平硐掘进新纪录

    官风倒　士气升
    中梁山煤矿创全国平硐掘进新纪录
    新华社重庆2日电　重庆中梁山煤矿北平硐职工2月份创造了全国煤矿系统平硐掘进二百一十点五公尺的最高纪录。这一纪录超过了中梁山南平硐在1956年8月创造的月进二百零四公尺的全国纪录。中梁山煤矿南平硐在1956年8月创造全国最高纪录时，工作日是三十一天，而北平硐在今年2月份实际只有二十七个工作日。
    中梁山煤矿北平硐创造的新纪录，同工地领导干部大力克服官僚主义分不开。这个工地在去年三季度以前，一连九个月没有完成国家计划。那时候，工地主任脱离群众，政治思想工作薄弱，施工管理混乱，劳动纪律松弛，出勤率只达到70％左右。在整风运动中，工地主任除了公开在群众中作检讨以外，并且经常深入群众了解情况，同工人谈心，有事找大家商量，从而大大鼓舞了职工群众的创造性。
