Replenishing Planting to Make Jiangnan Green
    Jiujiang Prefecture Youth Emphasize Afforestation Quality

    (Our newspaper from Nanchang) Jiujiang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, has mobilized young people to inspect the survival rate of afforestation and replant in a timely manner to ensure the quality of greening. In the spring of 1956, the district organized more than 35,000 young people to green the south bank of the Yangtze River, planting 400,000 trees along the 270-plus li of the riverbank. Now, many places are shaded by green trees, standing on the river bank like rows of green screens. However, because some places neglected the post-planting cultivation work, it is estimated that more than 120,000 trees have died. The Jiujiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to mobilize young people along the river to carry out a comprehensive replanting and maintenance effort, requiring "planting one tree, keeping one alive." Now, young people in various places along the river have launched competitions. The Jiangji Township youth, who won the pioneer award for greening the south bank of the Yangtze River in 1956, spent only three days universally replanting three to five rows of trees on the 24-li-long riverbank.

    补栽补种绿满江南
    九江专区青少年重视造林质量
    本报南昌讯　江西省九江专区发动青少年检查造林成活情况，及时补栽，保证绿化的质量。该区1956年春，组织三万五千多名青少年绿化长江南岸，在二百七十多华里的江岸栽了四十万棵树。现在，不少地方都已经绿树成荫，像一排排的绿色屏风一样立在江岸。但因为有些地方忽视了栽后的培育工作，估计共死掉十二万多株。共青团九江地委决定发动沿江青少年，全面开展一次补栽培兜工作。并要求做到“补一棵、活一棵”。现在沿江各地青少年都开展了竞赛。1956年曾获绿化长江南岸先锋的江矶乡青年，只三天时间就在长达二十四华里的江岸普遍补栽了三到五排树。
