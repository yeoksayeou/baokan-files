Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 20th. With the arrival of spring in the frontier, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have begun sowing spring wheat.

This year's spring wheat sowing is better than in previous years, characterized by more fertilizer, good soil moisture, and widespread use of improved varieties. Many agricultural cooperatives are also using seed drills. Farmers of all ethnic groups on the Hetao Plain have generally carried out furrow and ridge irrigation preparations for wheat fields, basically eliminating large plots of more than ten mu. Hangjin Rear Banner has prepared more than 500 seed drills, most of which are also equipped with manure boxes. Using this type of seed drill can increase wheat yield by about 20%-30% per mu. Many agricultural cooperatives on the southern slopes of the Yin Mountains have also adopted new sowing methods of rational close planting and cross-sowing this year.

Spring wheat is an important grain crop in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This year, the region will sow 8.9 million mu, accounting for about 15% of the total area of grain crops. (Attached photo)

    内蒙古播种春小麦
    据新华社呼和浩特20日电  春到塞外，内蒙古自治区各族农民开始播种春小麦。
    今年春小麦的播种工作比历年都好，特点是肥料多、墒土好、良种普遍，有许多农业社还采用播种机播种。河套平原上的各族农民，普遍进行了麦田的沟灌和畦灌准备工作，把十亩以上的大地块基本消灭了。杭锦后旗已准备了五百多台播种机，大部播种机上还安装了粪箱。采用这种播种机播种，每亩约能增产小麦20％—30％。阴山南麓的许多农业社，今年也采用了合理密植和交叉播种的新的播种方法。
    春小麦是内蒙古自治区的重要粮食作物，今年全区将播种八百九十万亩，约占粮食作物总面积的15％。（附图片）
