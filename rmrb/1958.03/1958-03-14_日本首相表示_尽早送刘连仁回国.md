    Japanese Prime Minister States He Will Send Liu Lianren Back to China as Soon as Possible

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 13th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated on the 12th that the Japanese government will try to send Chinese citizen Liu Lianren back to China as soon as possible.
    Liu Lianren was abducted from Shandong Province to Japan by the Japanese army in 1944 to perform forced labor. To escape persecution by the Japanese army, he lived in a cave in the wilderness of Hokkaido for thirteen years, and was only recently discovered.
    Kishi made this statement in response to a question raised by Socialist Party member Tatsuo Tanaka at a meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.
    During the interpellation, Tanaka pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke, as a member of the Tojo government, should be responsible for the abduction of innocent Chinese citizens. Tanaka requested the Japanese government to send Liu Lianren and the remains of Chinese martyrs who died in Japan back to China. In his reply, Kishi also stated that he is willing to work hard to resolve the issue of returning the remains of Chinese martyrs in the future.
    On the same day, organizations such as the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Peace Liaison Committee, and the National Council of Bereaved Families, submitted a written request to the Japanese government, demanding the disclosure of the survey report on the situation of Chinese laborers abducted to Japan during the war, which is kept by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and to hand over the report to them for forwarding to the Chinese Red Cross Society.

    日本首相表示
    尽早送刘连仁回国
    新华社13日讯  东京消息：日本首相岸信介12日表示，日本政府将设法尽早把中国公民刘连仁送回中国。
    刘连仁是在1944年被日本军队从山东省掳到日本服强迫劳役，为逃避日军迫害在北海道穴居荒山十三年，直到最近才被发现。
    岸信介是在众议院外务委员会会议上答复社会党议员田中稔男提出的质问时这样表示的。
    田中在质询时指出，岸信介身为东条政府的一个成员，应该对掳走无辜的中国公民的事情负责。田中要求日本政府把刘连仁以及在日本殉难的中国烈士的遗骨送回中国。岸信介在答复时还表示，今后愿意努力解决送回中国烈士遗骨的问题。
    同一天，日本红十字会、日中友好协会、和平联络会和留守家族团体全国协议会等团体，向日本政府提出要求书，要求公开外务省所保存的有关战时被掳到日本的中国劳工的情况的调查报告书，并且把报告书交给它们，以便寄送给中国红十字会。
