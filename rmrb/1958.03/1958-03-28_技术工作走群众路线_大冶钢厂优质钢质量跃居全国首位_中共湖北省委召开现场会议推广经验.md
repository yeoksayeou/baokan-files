    Taking the Mass Line in Technical Work
    Daye Steel Plant's High-Quality Steel Quality Jumps to First Place in the Country
    Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China Holds On-Site Meeting to Promote Experience

    Wuhan, March 27th (by our reporter Cao Baoming) The electric furnace workshop of Daye Steel Plant, in solving the quality problems of high-quality steel, has accumulated relatively complete experience on how to implement the mass line in production technology, making the qualification rate of high-quality steel leap from 91.66% in 1955 to 99.54% in 1957, ranking first in the country alongside Dalian Steel Plant, and continuing to rise to 99.86% and 99.79% in January and February this year. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an on-site meeting at this plant, gathering the city party secretaries of the province, focusing on studying and promoting their experience.
    Their specific approach is: to organize technical cadres and the masses together, conduct a comprehensive technical analysis of current production problems, identify the key points, organize experimental research, and once successful, fully promote it and revise technical procedures. Afterwards, they re-analyze, re-experiment, re-promote, and re-supplement the procedures, repeatedly cycling, and constantly improving. This combines politics and technology, scientific management and mobilizing the masses, key experiments and universal promotion.
    In the past, the quality of high-quality steel produced by Daye Steel Plant was very poor. In one period, these substandard steels were even released from the factory, causing harm to many ordering units.
    The scrap of high-quality steel mainly occurred in the electric furnace workshop. However, when they started to solve the quality problem in the first half of 1955, they only organized technical cadres to go to the site for a temporary inspection, and then, based on the explanations in the books, formulated a set of technical measures to implement. As a result, they spent several months, but because they did not find the most fundamental problem, high-quality steel was still scrapped batch after batch. It was not until the end of the year, when Soviet expert Zhuyev came to the factory, dissected the steel ingot for inspection, that they discovered that their main problem was that the hydrogen content in the steel was too high, causing "bubbles" like holes inside the steel ingot. He immediately put forward suggestions such as "oxygen blowing to remove hydrogen," and personally refined three furnaces of steel, all of which were smooth and without a single bubble.
    "Why did the Soviet expert find the problem as soon as he came, while we couldn't find it for a long time? Why did the Soviet expert dissect the steel ingot for inspection as soon as he came, while we didn't dissect one to see after messing around for several months?" They were inspired from this: not only should they learn the expert's technology, but they must also learn his scientific research spirit. They decided to further organize experimental research in implementing the expert's suggestions, specifically identifying in which major processes hydrogen increased, and controlling it.
    They focused on Furnace No. 2, which produced the most "bubbles," and sent technical cadres to follow the workers in three shifts, comprehensively recording and analyzing each process from raw materials, smelting, ingot casting to finishing, identifying the key points, and then studying methods with the workers and organizing experiments. They experimented for more than fifty days, more than one hundred furnaces (complete records were kept for forty-four furnaces), and finally found the cause of the "hydrogen" and found ways to overcome the problem together with the workers.
    During this period, Daye Steel Plant also changed the practice of "more criticism and less help" in political work, and went deep into the Mou Lin team, which had the worst quality, to help the team strengthen unity and organize them to learn from the already successful experience, so that the product quality of this team jumped to the first place in the entire workshop after three months. They used this team as a typical example to conduct education throughout the workshop, increasing the masses' confidence in improving quality. Around the time of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1956, the general branch of the workshop organized all cadres to study Chairman Mao's four works such as "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," and the documents of the Eighth National Congress, enabling the cadres to further realize that any work must proceed from reality and follow the mass line. They also summarized the work of the previous stage in this study, clarifying that the key to continuing to move forward was to truly transform the successfully tested experience into the regular activities of the masses—that is, mobilizing the masses to revise the technical regulations, and then using the technical regulations to unify the operations of the masses. When revising the regulations, they changed the past practice of technical cadres drafting a large set of regulations and implementing them, but first revised the regulations based on existing technical experience, drafted a draft, and then mobilized the masses to discuss and revise the regulations, making the regulations more in line with reality.
    Because the new regulations came from the masses, the workers were very serious in learning the regulations, achieving "three knows": knowing how to recite the articles, knowing how to explain the principles, and knowing how to operate according to the regulations. The workers also formulated group task books (what to do), post operation methods (how to do it), and after-shift technical analysis (summarizing experiences and lessons) according to the regulations, making technical management a daily activity of the masses, laying the foundation for continued quality improvement. At the end of 1956, the general branch committee of the workshop continued to organize the masses to launch an increase production and economize movement centered on improving quality. At the same time, it organized technical cadres to follow the team for experiments, taking eight samples from each furnace for testing and analysis, finding out the changing patterns of hydrogen in steelmaking and the scientific numerical basis for "oxygen blowing to remove hydrogen." They immediately drew curve charts and explained them to the workers. The workers had a more specific and deeper understanding of the problem, and also created more ways to control hydrogen. They also incorporated the advanced experience created by the masses into the technical regulations. Therefore, although the high-quality steel they refined last year increased from 127 kinds in 1955 to 196 kinds, its qualification rate jumped to 99.54%, exceeding the national target by 1.04%, and comprehensively overfulfilling the output and cost plans. In January and February of this year, they conducted experiments based on the suggestions of the masses, solving the surface quality problem of high-aluminum steel that has not yet been solved nationwide. Of the 16 teams in the entire workshop, 14 teams had 100% quality in January, and 15 teams had 100% in February.
    At the on-site meeting of city party secretaries in the province, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed them: "Adhere to the mass line, deepen the rectification movement, implement the technical revolution, and catch up with and surpass Britain." In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the factory set out an annual leap forward production plan, to continue to experiment and promote new technologies such as "mixed steelmaking method" and "vacuum treatment," trial-produce more than 20 new steel grades, achieve an annual qualification rate of 99.7%, increase output by 70%, and reduce costs by 1 million yuan.

    技术工作走群众路线
    大冶钢厂优质钢质量跃居全国首位
    中共湖北省委召开现场会议推广经验
    本报武汉27日电　记者曹葆铭报道：大冶钢厂电炉车间在解决优质钢的质量问题中，对怎样在生产技术上贯彻群众路线，积累了比较完整的经验，使优质钢的合格率由1955年的91.66％，跃进到1957年的99.54％，和大连钢厂同居全国第一，今年1、2月又继续上升到99.86％和99.79％。中共湖北省委最近在这个厂召集全省的市委书记开现场会议，着重研究和推广他们这项经验。
    他们的具体作法是：将技术干部和群众组织起来，针对当前的生产问题进行全面的技术分析，找出关键，组织试验研究，成功后即全面推广，并修订技术规程，以后又再分析，再试验，再推广，再充实规程，反复循环，不断提高。这样就使政治和技术、科学管理和发动群众、重点试验和普遍推广结合起来。
    大冶钢厂过去生产的优质钢质量很坏，有个时期还将这些不合格的钢放出了工厂，给许多订货单位造成祸害。
    优质钢的废品主要出在电炉车间。但是，1955年上半年，他们着手解决质量问题的时候，他们只是组织技术干部临时下现场检查一番，便根据书上的解释，拟出一套一套的技术措施加以贯彻，结果闹了几个月，因为没有找出最根本的问题，优质钢仍然整炉整炉报废。直到年底，苏联专家朱也夫来工厂，剖开钢锭检查，才发现他们的问题主要是钢中含的氢太高，使钢锭内部产生一个个窟窿似的“气泡”。他立即提出了“吹氧去氢”等项建议，并亲自炼了三炉钢，都是光堂堂的，没有一个气泡。
    “为什么苏联专家一来就找出问题，而自己长期找不到呢？为什么苏联专家一来就要剖开钢锭检查，而自己闹了几个月也不剖开一根看看呢？”他们从这里受到启发：不仅要学专家的技术，还必须学他的科学研究精神。他们决定在贯彻专家建议中，进一步组织试验研究，具体找出氢在哪几个主要工序上增加的，加以控制。
    他们以出“气泡”最多的二号炉为重点，将技术干部派去跟着工人三班倒，从原料、冶炼、铸锭到精整各工序，都全面纪录分析，找出关键，再和工人一起研究办法，组织试验。他们一共试验了五十多天，一百多炉（完整纪录的是四十四炉），终于找到了产生“氢”的原因，并且和工人一起找到了克服毛病的办法。
    在这个期间，大冶钢厂还改变了政治工作中“批评多、帮助少”的作法，深入到质量最差的牟琳班去工作，帮助这个班加强团结，组织他们学习已经成功的经验，使这个班的产品质量在三个月后跃进为全车间第一。他们又以这个班为典型，在全车间进行教育，增加群众搞好质量的信心。1956年中共“八大”前后，车间总支又组织全体干部学习毛主席的“整顿党的作风”、“关于领导方法的若干问题”等四篇著作和“八大”文献，使干部进一步认识任何工作必须从实际出发和走群众路线。他们还在这次学习中总结了前一段工作，明确继续前进的关键是在把试验成功的经验真正变为群众的经常活动——即发动群众来修改技术规程，再用技术规程来统一群众的操作。在修改规程的时候，他们改变了过去由技术干部拟出一大套规程往下贯的作法，而由技术干部先根据已有的技术经验，将规程加以修改，拟出草稿，再发动群众讨论和修改规程，使规程更加切合实际。
    因为新的规程是从群众中来的，工人在学习规程中都非常认真，做到了“三会”：会背条文，会讲道理，会按规程操作。工人们还按照规程制订小组任务书（干什么）、岗位操作法（怎么干）和班后技术分析（总结经验教训），使技术管理成为群众的日常活动，为继续提高质量打下了基础。1956年年底，车间总支委员会继续组织群众展开以提高质量为中心的增产节约运动。同时，组织技术干部跟班试验，每炉都取八个样子化验分析，找出了氢在炼钢中的变化规律和“吹氧去氢”的科学数字依据。他们立即绘成曲线图表，向工人讲解。工人们对这个问题了解的更具体、更深刻，也就更多地创造出各种控制氢的办法。他们又将群众创造的先进经验纳入技术规程。因此，他们去年炼的优质钢虽由1955年的一百二十七种增加到一百九十六种，但其合格率却跃进为99.54％，超过国家指标1.04％，并全面超额完成产量、成本计划。今年1、2月里，他们又根据群众的建议进行试验，使全国尚未解决的高铝钢表面质量问题得到解决。全车间十六个班，1月份有十四个班的质量百分之百，2月份有十五个班百分之百。
    在全省的市委书记现场会议上，中共湖北省委指示他们：“坚持群众路线，深入整风运动，实行技术革命，赶上和超过英国。”这个厂在反浪费反保守运动中，订出全年的生产跃进计划，要继续试验和推广“混合炼钢法”和“真空处理”等新技术，试制二十多种新钢种，做到全年的合格率为99.7％，产量增加70％，成本降低一百万元。
