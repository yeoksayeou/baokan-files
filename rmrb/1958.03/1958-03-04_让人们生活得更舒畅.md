    Making People's Lives More Comfortable

    The staff and workers of the service industry in Beijing have joined the ranks of the Great Leap Forward.

    The service industry is most closely related to people's lives. When people's clothes are dirty, they need to be washed; when they are torn, they need to be sewn; when their hair is long, they need to be cut; when their leather shoes are broken, they need to be repaired. When people leave home, they need to stay in hotels and eat meals. During festivals, old friends meet and want to take photos. All of this is inseparable from the service industry. If the service industry does a good job, it can make people's lives more comfortable and beautiful, and their work enthusiasm will be greater.

    Now, all walks of life are making a great leap forward. Service industry workers should use their labor to make people feel happier, work with better spirits, and have greater enthusiasm. We hope that service industry workers across the country will join the ranks of the nationwide Great Leap Forward together with the service industry workers in Beijing.

    让人们生活得更舒畅
    北京市服务行业的职工们参加到大跃进的行列里来了。
    服务行业跟人民的生活最密切。人们衣服脏了要洗，破了要缝，头发长了要理，皮鞋破了要补。人们离家出门要住旅店，要吃饭。逢年过节，老朋友见了面，还要拍照。这一切，都离不开服务行业。服务行业工作做得好，可以使人民的生活过得更舒服，更美丽，工作劲头更足。
    现在，各行各业都在大跃进。服务行业的职工应该用自己的劳动，让人们心情更加畅快，干起活来精神更好，劲头更足。我们希望全国各地的服务行业职工，跟北京市的服务行业职工一道参加到全民性的大跃进的行列里来。
