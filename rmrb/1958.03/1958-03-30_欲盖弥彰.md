    To Cover Up Is to Expose

    The Indonesian military recently revealed again: foreign aircraft continue to airdrop military supplies to the rebels. Judging from the fact that the weapons seized by the government troops were all made in the United States, their origin was already very clear. However, the United States has repeatedly denied interfering in Indonesia.

    Coincidentally, according to a Manila dispatch from Agence France-Presse, on the 27th, in Davao City, Philippines, a U.S. Navy bomber suddenly made a forced landing. The aircraft body, however, lacked the usual star insignia of the U.S. Air Force. This was already suspicious.

    As soon as the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines heard the news, it rushed to declare that this was just a U.S. aircraft that experienced a mechanical failure during a flight.

    However, unfortunately for the U.S. Embassy officials, bullet holes were actually discovered on the aircraft body. Thus, even the Philippine News Agency had no choice but to issue a cable saying that this aircraft "may have flown over Indonesian airspace and been hit by anti-aircraft fire." The "foreign" aircraft that airdropped weapons to the rebels has been found, and the United States' crime of interfering in Indonesia has gained another piece of physical evidence.

    欲盖弥彰
    印度尼西亚军方最近又揭露：有外国飞机继续在给叛军空投军火。从政府军缴获的武器都是美国造的一点来看，它们的由来，本来已经一清二楚了。可是美国却一再否认有干涉印度尼西亚的行为。
    事有凑巧，据法新社马尼拉消息，27日，在菲律宾的纳卯城，突如其来地有一架美国海军轰炸机被迫降落了。机身上却没有通常的美国空军的星形标志。这已经是可怪的了。
    美国驻菲大使馆一听到这个消息，连忙出来声明说，这不过是一架美国飞机，在一次飞行中发生了机械故障。
    不过，对于美国大使馆官员们来说，不幸的是，机身上竟被发现了弹孔。这样，就连菲律宾通讯社也无可奈何地发出电讯说，这一架飞机“可能曾经飞越印度尼西亚领空，并且遭到防空炮火打中。”给叛军空投武器的“外国”飞机有着落了，美国干涉印度尼西亚的罪行，又多了一件物证。
