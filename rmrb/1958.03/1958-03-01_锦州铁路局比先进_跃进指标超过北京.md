The Jinzhou Railway Bureau Compares with Advanced Units; Leap Forward Targets Exceed Beijing

(Our newspaper's reporter Fan Rongkang reports) The head of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau informed this reporter via long-distance telephone on the afternoon of February 28th that the bureau's more than 50,000 employees, with a spirit of leaping forward like riding the wind and waves, are responding to the Beijing Railway Bureau's competition initiative and have decided that all targets must catch up with and surpass the Beijing Railway Bureau.

The reporter saw the letter of challenge sent by the Jinzhou Railway Bureau at the Ministry of Railways. This letter of challenge puts forward eighteen leap forward targets, all but one of which reach or exceed the items listed in the Beijing Bureau's initiative. According to the head of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, after the realization of these eighteen leap forward targets, in 1958, the country can increase production and save more than 23 million yuan.

Prior to this, on January 22nd, one hundred and twenty-six advanced producers and veteran workers from the Jinzhou Railway Bureau jointly published a "Hundred Person Initiative," setting out a leap forward plan to break through the state's planned targets. For example, the state plan requires an average daily output of 650,000 ton-kilometers per locomotive, and the "Hundred Person Initiative" proposed to reach 680,000 ton-kilometers. Another example is that the state plan requires an average traction weight of 1,794 tons for each freight locomotive, and the "Hundred Person Initiative" proposed to reach 1,800 tons. The "Hundred Person Initiative" aroused enthusiastic response among the masses after it was announced, and encouraged the revolutionary drive of the bureau's employees. Soon, the Beijing Railway Bureau put forward an initiative with much higher conditions, which greatly stimulated the Jinzhou Bureau employees' spirit of leaping forward. After careful research and multi-faceted exploration of potential, the Jinzhou Bureau formulated a more leap forward plan on the basis of the "Hundred Person Initiative." According to this plan, the daily output of each locomotive is not 680,000 ton-kilometers, but 1,000,000 ton-kilometers, and the average traction weight of each freight locomotive is not 1,800 tons, but 2,211 tons. All other targets have also far surpassed the level of the state plan and the "Hundred Person Initiative."

Now, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau's employees are working hard to achieve the leap forward targets, and some targets have already been achieved and surpassed. The most important tasks within the Jinzhou Bureau are the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot and the Dahushan Locomotive Depot, and both of these locomotive depots have taken active action. According to statistics for twenty days in February, the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot had an average output of more than 1 million ton-kilometers per locomotive for sixteen days, with the highest reaching 1,252,000 ton-kilometers. During the same period, the Dahushan Locomotive Depot also had an average output of close to or exceeding 1 million ton-kilometers per locomotive for six days. This locomotive depot decided to achieve an average daily output of 1.4 million ton-kilometers per locomotive for the entire depot before "May 1st" and a daily output of 1.5 million ton-kilometers before "October 1st."

The head of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau told reporters that their main experience in organizing the Great Leap Forward is to mobilize the masses to oppose conservatism. He said that the locomotive department, based on the line conditions of the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line, had calculated a limit, that the locomotive could pull up to 2,700 tons, and the technical speed per hour should not exceed 45 kilometers, and that load capacity, speed, and fuel were contradictory. More load cannot run fast, fast running cannot load more, and more load and fast running must waste coal. As a result, the actions of the masses shattered this conservative thinking. One locomotive loaded 3,580 tons and passed the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line at a technical speed of 50.3 kilometers per hour, saving more than one ton of coal. This fact gave the cadres of various departments a great education.

### 锦州铁路局比先进  跃进指标超过北京

    锦州铁路局比先进
    跃进指标超过北京
    本报讯　记者范荣康报道：锦州铁路管理局负责人2月28日下午在长途电话中告诉记者，这个局的五万多名职工正以乘风破浪的跃进精神，响应北京铁路管理局的竞赛倡议，决定各项指标都要赶上和超过北京铁路管理局。
    记者在铁道部看到锦州铁路管理局送来的应战书。这份应战书提出了十八项跃进指标，除一项外，都达到和超过北京局倡议中列有的项目。据锦州铁路管理局负责人说：这十八项跃进指标实现后，1958年可为国家增产节约二千三百多万元。
    在这以前，1月22日，锦州铁路管理局一百二十六名先进生产者和老工人曾联名发表“百人倡议”，订出了突破国家计划指标的跃进计划。如国家计划要求每台机车平均日产量六十五万吨公里，“百人倡议”提出达到六十八万吨公里。又如国家计划要求每台货物机车平均牵引重量达到一千七百九十四吨，“百人倡议”提出要达到一千八百吨。“百人倡议”公布后在群众中引起了热烈的反映，鼓舞了全局职工的革命干劲。不久，北京铁路管理局以高得多的条件提出倡议，更大大激发了锦州局职工跃进的精神。经过仔细的研究、多方面地挖掘潜力，锦州局又在“百人倡议”的基础上订出了更跃进一步的计划。根据这个计划，每台机车的日产量不是六十八万吨公里，而是一百万吨公里，每台货物机车的平均牵引重量不是一千八百吨，而是二千二百十一吨。其他各项指标也无一不远远地跃过了国家计划和“百人倡议”的水平。
    现在，锦州铁路管理局全局职工正在奋力实现跃进指标，而且有些指标已经实现和超过了。锦州局境内以山海关机务段和大虎山机务段的任务最重，这两个机务段都已积极行动起来。据2月份二十天的统计，山海关机务段已有十六天平均每台机车的产量在百万吨公里以上，最高的达到一百二十五万二千吨公里。在同一时期内，大虎山机务段也有六天平均每台机车的产量接近或者超过百万吨公里。这个机务段决定在“五一”前做到全段机车平均每天日产一百四十万吨公里，“十一”前日产一百五十万吨公里。
    锦州铁路管理局负责人对记者说：他们组织大跃进的主要经验，就是发动群众反保守。他说：机务部门根据沈（阳）山（海关）线的线路情况，曾经计算出一个限额，机车至多拉二千七百吨，每小时的技术速度不得超过四十五公里，并且认为载重、速度和燃料是矛盾的。多拉不能快跑，快跑不能多拉，多拉快跑必定费煤。结果，群众的行动粉碎了这种保守思想，有一台机车载重三千五百八十吨，以每小时五十点三公里的技术速度通过了沈山线，并且节省煤炭一吨多。这个事实给了各个部门的干部很大的教育。
