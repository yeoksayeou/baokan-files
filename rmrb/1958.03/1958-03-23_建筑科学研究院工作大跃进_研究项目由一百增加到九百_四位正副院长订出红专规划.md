    Academy of Building Research Makes Great Leap Forward
    Research Projects Increase from 100 to 900
    Four President and Vice Presidents Formulate Red and Expert Plan
    (Our dispatch) The "Double-Anti" movement is vigorously developing in the Academy of Building Research of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. More than 700 people in the entire academy have written more than 80,000 big-character posters. These posters fiercely attacked conservative thinking, promoted a great leap forward in research work, and increased the number of research projects eightfold.
    The biggest gain from the "Double-Anti" movement is that it changed the research style of scientific researchers who neglected production and were divorced from reality, and clarified the idea that research work must be closely integrated with production and serve production. Researchers throughout the academy unanimously proposed: "Leave no space unfilled, drill into every crack, and do everything possible to do more for the current construction industry." Researchers took the initiative to contact production units, strengthen collaboration, and establish research bases; they "visited teachers and sought guidance" everywhere to increase and enrich research projects. The Industrial and Civil Building Research Office visited 13 units, including the Rural Work Department and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to research rural building projects. The Cement Concrete Research Group decided to cooperate with the Beijing Building Materials Bureau to study lime concrete. Scientific researchers everywhere tapped potential, broke conventions, and completed tasks quickly, well, and economically. The Brick and Stone Group shortened the research time for the empty wall project from two years to one year. The Waterproof Materials Group used to have only one research topic for nine people; now, with fewer people, the number of research topics has increased to nineteen.
    This academy originally had more than 360 researchers and 109 research projects; now, the number of personnel has been reduced by a quarter, but after several leaps forward, the number of research projects has increased to more than 900 (including problems solved on-site).
    A socialist leap forward competition has now been launched throughout the academy. Fifty-seven-year-old engineer Song Linzheng proposed to compete with young people in terms of energy. The young people are even more energetic. In the past, it took one day for Li Dehui and Wu Yingtian, young people from the Building Materials Office, to mix Jelok (waterproof material), but now it takes only two hours.
    In addition, the four president and vice presidents of the Academy of Building Research, Wang Lizhi, Ni Nongpan, Qiao Xingbei, and Zhang Enshu, have jointly formulated a leap forward plan to complete the ten-year plan in five years, determined to become both red and expert scientific workers. In their leap forward plan, they stipulated that they should study Marxism-Leninism well, improve their leadership style, do a good job in leading the Academy of Building Sciences, and at the same time strive to master scientific knowledge. They want to learn Russian and be able to read, speak, and listen in their professional field within five years. Within three years, with the help of engineers, they will spend 1,000 hours completing university professional courses. After three years, they will be able to directly participate in scientific research in a certain field.

    建筑科学研究院工作大跃进
    研究项目由一百增加到九百
    四位正副院长订出红专规划
    本报讯　建筑工程部建筑科学研究院双反运动蓬勃开展，全院七百多人，写出大字报八万多张。大字报猛烧保守思想，促进了研究工作的大跃进，研究项目提高了八倍。
    双反最大的收获是，改变了科学研究人员忽视生产、脱离实际的研究风气，明确了研究工作必须紧密结合生产，为生产服务的思想。全院的研究人员一致提出：“无空不入，无缝不钻，千方百计地为当前建筑事业多做些事情。”研究人员主动和生产单位联系，加强协作，建立研究基地；到处“访师求道”，增加和充实研究项目。工业民用建筑研究室为研究有关农村建筑项目，曾访问了农村工作部、农业科学研究所等十三个单位。水泥混凝土研究组决定同北京建筑材料局合作，研究石灰混凝土。科学研究人员到处挖掘潜力，打破常规，多快好省地完成任务。砖石组把空头墙专题的研究时间由二年缩短为一年。防水材料组过去九个人只订了一个研究专题；现在人员减少，研究题目却增加到十九个。
    这个院原有研究人员三百六十多人，研究项目一百零九项；现在人员缩减了四分之一，经过几次跃进，研究项目却增加到九百多项（包括为现场解决的问题）。
    全院现已展开社会主义跃进大竞赛。五十七岁的宋麟征工程师提出要和青年比干劲。青年人的干劲更大，建筑材料室青年李德徽、吴膺恬过去拌制捷罗克（防水材料）要一天时间，现在缩短到二小时。
    又讯　建筑科学研究院的四位正副院长汪力之、倪弄畔、乔兴北、张恩树等共同订出了十年规划五年完成的跃进计划，下定决心，要使自己成为又红又专的科学工作者。他们在跃进规划中订出，自己要好好学习马列主义，改进领导作风，作好建筑科学院的领导工作，同时还要努力掌握科学知识。他们要学习俄文，五年内在专业范围内作到能看、能讲、能听。三年之内，要在工程师的帮助下，用一千小时的时间，学完大学专业课程。三年以后，能够直接参加某一方面的科学研究工作。
