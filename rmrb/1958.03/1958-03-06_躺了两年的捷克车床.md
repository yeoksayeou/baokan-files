    Czech Lathe Idle for Two Years
    Wang Jun from the Fourth Group of the First Mechanical Engineering Department of the Beijing Institute of Technology posted a big-character poster stating: The state invested more than 430,000 yuan in our institute's 140 Laboratory, which could have been used to build a complete mechanical manufacturing process laboratory with this huge sum. However, the waste and backlog of equipment are shocking! For example, there is a Czech lathe, several meters long, that has been idle for two years without doing any work, but the maintenance costs for it are not low! In addition, some machine tools were "grabbed" under the influence of departmentalism but are not being utilized. According to rough estimates, the backlog and waste in this laboratory have reached 200,000 yuan!

    躺了两年的捷克车床
    北京工业学院第一机械系四组王峻贴了一张大字报写道：国家投资四十三万多元给我院一四○实验室，本来可以利用这一笔巨款建成一座完备的机械制造工艺实验室，但是设备的浪费积压十分惊人！例如有一台捷克车床身长数公尺，躺了两年，未做任何工作，但为它花费的保养费却不少！此外有些机床是在本位主义支配下“抢”到手的，却不利用。据粗略统计，这个实验室的积压浪费已达二十万元！
