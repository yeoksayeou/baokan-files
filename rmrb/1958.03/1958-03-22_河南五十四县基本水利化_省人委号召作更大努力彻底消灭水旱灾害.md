Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 21st: Fifty-four counties (cities) in Henan Province have basically achieved water conservancy. This was stated in a notice issued by the Provincial People's Committee on the 20th.

These counties (cities) account for nearly half of the total number of counties (cities) in the province. They can already turn more than 70% of the cultivated land into paddy fields or irrigated land, and can irrigate in a timely manner to ensure a good harvest even without rain for a hundred days. At the same time, in the event of a rainfall of 200 millimeters (300 to 400 millimeters in some counties), the mountainous areas can prevent soil erosion and water from flowing out of the mountains, and the plains can prevent runoff and flooding.

The notice said that this is the result of the active labor of the people of the province under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government; it is a victory in implementing the water conservancy construction policy of focusing on storage, small-scale projects, and community management; it is a concrete manifestation of the superiority of the cooperative system; and it is a great leap forward in socialist construction. The notice pointed out that to completely eliminate water and drought disasters, even greater efforts are needed. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent and overcome complacency, make persistent efforts, and continue to advance. On the existing basis, some medium-sized projects should be built in a planned way to control the water from the sky, the surface, and underground completely and use it for production. At the same time, it is necessary to give full play to the benefits of water conservancy projects, vigorously solve problems such as water lifting tools and land leveling, and ensure timely irrigation and good harvests.

    河南五十四县基本水利化
    省人委号召作更大努力彻底消灭水旱灾害
    新华社郑州21日电　河南省已有五十四个县（市）基本实现水利化。这是省人民委员会在20日发布的一项通报中说的。
    这些县（市）占全省县（市）总数的近一半。它们已经可以把70％以上的耕地变成水田或水浇地，能够在百日无雨的情况下适时灌溉，保证丰收；同时，在一次降雨二百公厘时（有些县是三百至四百公厘），山区能够土不下山，水不出川，平原能够不产生径流，不发生水灾。
    通报说，这是全省人民在共产党和人民政府领导下积极劳动的结果；是贯彻执行以蓄为主，以小型为主，以社办为主水利建设方针的胜利；是合作化制度优越性的具体表现；是社会主义建设事业的一个大跃进。通报指出，要达到彻底消灭水、旱灾害，还要做更大的努力。因此必须防止和克服骄傲自满情绪，要再接再厉，继续前进，在现有基础上，有计划地再建一些中型工程做骨干，把天上、地面上和地下的水完全控制起来，用于生产。同时，要充分发挥水利工程的效益，大力解决提水工具、平整土地等问题，保证适时灌溉，保证作物丰收。
