    The Truth About Capitalist Prosperity
    —Commenting on George Meany’s speech on the US economic situation at the AFL-CIO emergency meeting
    Commentator for the Soviet "Pravda"
    George Meany delivered the speech published in this newspaper at an emergency meeting of the AFL-CIO, the largest trade union organization in the United States. Among the thousands of people attending the meeting were not only representatives of trade unions, but also personnel from the government's Department of Labor and Department of Commerce, as well as representatives from many other groups. This three-day meeting was held under the common slogan of "Getting Americans Back to Work."
    The fact that prominent figures in the US government attended this meeting convened by a trade union organization shows the seriousness of the US economic situation. As economist Rothenberg said at the meeting, the current US economic situation is much worse than in 1949-1950 or 1953-1954. He mentioned that, according to official figures, if the number of unemployed people in a region exceeds 6% of the total number of employed workers, then that region can be considered a "disaster area." Rothenberg then pointed out that the current US unemployment rate is 7.7%, and said: "We must admit that the entire United States is now a disaster area." But it should be known that not long ago, all those who promoted capitalism were shouting themselves hoarse, as if the United States was a "perpetually prosperous region" on Earth!
    According to official materials published by the US government in January, national production decreased by 9.5% in a relatively short period. Partial materials from February show that production continued to decline, decreasing by 11% compared to the previous year.
    As Meany pointed out, the production reduction has caused 5.25 million people to lose their jobs. More than 3 million workers are forced to work only a few days a week, and their labor income has also decreased. That is to say, including family members (calculated as an average of four per family), 33 million people in the United States are suffering from unemployment, which is more than one-sixth of the national population.
    N.S. Khrushchev emphasized in his speech to voters in the Kalinin district of Moscow: "George Meany has painted a bleak picture of the current US economic situation." After pointing out the figures cited by this American trade union leader, N.S. Khrushchev came to the following conclusion: "The arms race is beneficial to monopoly capitalists. They never worry about the current needs of the people. This is the nature of capitalism, the essence of capitalism. Getting rich and seizing maximum profits—this is what the people in power in capitalist countries are striving for. This is the driving force of capitalist society. That is the truth about capitalist prosperity! That is so-called capitalist freedom!"
    The number of unemployed people is increasing month by month. Unemployment, like a malignant tumor, is attacking the working-class districts of Detroit, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, and Chicago. More and more laborers are struggling to make ends meet. The few dollars saved for a rainy day are about to be spent. In January, 1.1 million people became unemployed. This is more than the number of unemployed during the Great Depression of 1929-1933. According to Meany himself, the number of unemployed people last month increased by another 750,000, the highest figure in nearly sixteen years.
    What makes American workers even more fearful is that tomorrow, or even today, they will be driven out of the factory gates. A reporter from "The Nation" magazine reported from Detroit: "Who will face the worst fate: the two thousand men and women who have already left the factory and are worried about their future, or the five thousand who remain in the factory and will engage in work that is as abusive as that of beasts? ... Whose tragedy is more terrible: the unemployed workers who have lost their labor and whose lives have fallen into despair, or those who still work but have no hope?"
    The economic difficulties that are sweeping across the United States are not only hitting the working class, clerks, and intellectuals. Large companies and large monopolies are using the current situation to squeeze out their weaker competitors. In the words of "New York Post" economic commentator Sylvia Porter, a terrible wave of bankruptcies is sweeping the country, the most terrible collapse in nearly twenty years, with three hundred small companies and factories closing every week. This is a vivid example of the "freedom of business" that American propagandists love to shout about. In the increasingly fierce competition, the only winners are the powerful vampires—monopoly capital—while small and medium capitalists are to be destroyed.
    Large companies and large monopolies are unscrupulous in their pursuit of profit. This is the nature of modern capitalism. They use unemployment to strengthen the exploitation of workers. They use the opportunity of market shrinkage to eliminate or annex weaker competitors. They use the increase in military spending to directly profit.
    It is understandable that American trade unions are concerned about the continued deterioration of the living standards of the working people. Anxiety about the future has reached such a wide and intense level that union leaders have had to take certain steps. The emergency meeting convened by the AFL-CIO is clearly the beginning of such steps.
    The Soviet working people do not fear unemployment, but they cannot but sympathize with the plight of unemployed American workers. N.S. Khrushchev said that we are certainly not happy about the increase in unemployed workers in the United States; unemployment is a real disaster for working people.
    It must be pointed out that some of the measures proposed by the AFL-CIO leaders will ultimately further worsen the living conditions of the American working people.
    In his speech, Meany emphasized the need to drastically increase appropriations for defense, i.e., US military preparations. In order to "prove" this proposal, Meany once again repeated the slanderous platitudes of bourgeois propaganda about so-called "communist aggression." Another excuse he gave was that military spending would help create "new wealth," although everyone has long known that the arms race, like war, does not create wealth, but destroys a large amount of wealth created by the labor of the people.
    Meany's suggestion to increase military spending is nothing new. Not long ago, this suggestion had already been made in the notorious "Gaither Report." It is understood that this report was drafted under the instruction and direct participation of McCloy, chairman of the Rockefeller family and the Rockefeller Group's "New York Manhattan Chase Bank." Later, the "Rockefeller Foundation Report" repeated and developed the basic arguments and conclusions of this "report." It is regrettable that Meany is merely repeating what the most aggressive American imperialist groups have repeatedly put forward.
    On this issue, the leaders of the AFL-CIO have taken a position that even many American business people oppose. Prominent entrepreneurs and economists believe that increasing military spending will not make the American economy healthy. Sober-minded Americans say very frankly that increasing military appropriations can improve the already not bad situation of the largest military industrial monopolies, but will inevitably worsen the situation of other American industrial sectors.
    Experience has shown that huge military orders can only cause the one-sided development of individual industrial sectors while weakening other industrial sectors.
    In the past year, voices shouting "full employment" and "amazing growth" in industry have been rampant in the United States. However, this surge in industrial production is an artificial phenomenon caused by the so-called "investment boom." This "investment boom" is a characteristic of the anarchic nature of the capitalist economy, which is controlled by the selfish interests of monopoly capital.
    In mutual competition, major companies continue to expand their production capacity, hoping to squeeze out competitors in the market. For example, the largest automobile companies have spent tens of billions of dollars in expanding production capacity. As a result, the "Big Three" US companies, "General Motors," "Ford," and "Chrysler," can effectively squeeze out weaker competitors. In this way, the production capacity of the automobile industry far exceeds the limits of the capitalist market, which is limited by purchasing power. The production capacity of the largest steel companies and many other companies has also increased in the same way due to the "investment boom."
    Because these production capacities cannot be used profitably, industrial companies are now beginning to drastically reduce investment. In the fourth quarter of 1957, investment in the entire US industry decreased by one-third compared to the same period last year. The reduction in investment was even more serious in heavy industry companies, reaching 47%; metallurgical companies even reduced it by 55%.
    In his speech, Meany commented on the current US economic situation, using the word "sick" several times. He said that the American economy "has contracted a terrible disease." He called unemployment an "infectious disease" more than once.
    This disease was discovered in the last century by Marx when he studied the laws of capitalist development. The genius Lenin studied this disease. Recently, in the United States, people have also had to talk about this "economic disease." This disease has truly unmistakably surprised business people, politicians, economists, and union leaders. In fact, this "disease" has defeated the American economy three times in the last decade. In 1949-1950, US industrial production fell by 10.5%. In 1953-1954, it fell again by 10.2%. The third attack will cause even more serious consequences.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches that economic crises in the capitalist economy are inevitable. Bourgeois theorists are unwilling or unable to abandon the fallacy of "crisis-free capitalism." They proclaim that the homeland of such capitalism is the United States. Cold reality has thoroughly overturned this fallacy.
    The historical experience of the development of the world's two major systems (socialism and capitalism) proves very definitely that the new society has forever rescued one-third of humanity from the terrible gangrene of capitalism (crisis and unemployment). The new society hands the means of production over to the people, forever eradicates the rule of money and the spirit of getting rich, and liberates the working people from the oppression of the exploitative system.
    The great American writer Dreiser once said with indignation and sorrow, "Work—this is the foundation of life. Not giving people work will put people in a terrible situation, restless all day long." When Dreiser saw the long line of disheartened unemployed workers in New York City, he wrote: "They are trying to live in this world, and they have been wandering around for a long time. Almost all of them, before they lose their strength and courage," always keep one thought in mind: how to "exchange heavy labor for a piece of bread—always a pitifully small piece of bread, of course." The people of socialist countries have been freed from this long-standing tragedy. This shows the enormous superiority of socialism over capitalism. We have the right to take pride in this.

    资本主义繁荣的真相
    ——评乔治·米尼在劳联——产联紧急会议上关于美国经济状况的演讲
    苏联“真理报”评论员
    乔治·米尼在美国最大的工会组织劳联—产联召开的紧急会议上，发表了本报所刊载的那篇演讲。出席这次会议的上千人当中不仅有工会的代表，还有政府劳工部和商务部两个部的人员，以及好多其它团体的代表。为期三天的这次会议，是在“使美国人重新获得就业机会”的共同口号下进行的。
    美国政府的显要人物出席工会组织召开的这次会议一事，说明美国的经济状况严重。正如在这次会议上发言的经济学家罗廷贝尔格所说的，目前美国的经济状况比起1949—1950年或1953—1954年的情况要糟得多。他提到，按照官方的说法，如果某一个地区内的失业人数超过在业工人总数的6％，那末这个地区就可以算作“灾区”。接着罗廷贝尔格在指出目前美国失业人口达7.7％之后说：“我们必须承认现在整个美国是一个灾区”。可是要知道，就在不久以前，一切宣扬资本主义的人还声嘶力竭地鼓吹，仿佛美国是地球上“永远繁荣的地区！”
    据1月份美国政府公布的官方材料，在比较短的时期里，全国的生产降低了9.5％。2月份的部分材料说明，生产继续下降，比上一年度减少了11％。
    正如米尼所指出的，生产减缩使五百二十五万人丧失了工作。有三百多万工人被迫每周只作几天的工，劳动收入也随之减少。这就是说，连家属（平均按四口之家计算）在内，美国有三千三百万人遭受失业的痛苦，即超过全国人口的六分之一。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科市加里宁选区对选民发表的讲话中着重指出：“乔治·米尼描绘了目前美国经济状况的一幅惨淡的图景。”尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫指出这个美国工会领导人所举的数字后，得出了下面的结论：“军备竞赛对垄断资本家有利。他们决不为人民的当前需要担心。这是资本主义的本性，是资本主义的实质。发财致富、攫取最大限度利润，——这是资本主义国家当权人物所极力追求的东西。这就是资本主义社会的动力。资本主义繁荣的真相就是如此！这就是所谓资本主义的自由！”
    失业人口逐月在增加。失业就像恶性肿瘤一般侵袭着底特律、洛杉矶、匹兹堡和芝加哥的工人区。有越来越多的劳动者度日维艰。为防备万一而积蓄下来的一点美元就要花光。1月份失业的达一百一十万人。这比1929—1933年大危机时期的失业人数还多。上月的失业人数，用米尼自己的话来说，又增加了七十五万，是近十六年来空前未有的最高数字。
    美国工人越发感到恐惧的是，明天或者就是今天会被赶出工厂的大门。“民族”杂志的记者从底特律报道说：“谁将面临着最坏的命运：是已经离开工厂，对前途担忧的二千个男女呢，还是仍然留在厂里，并且将要从事像畜生一般遭到凌辱的工作的五千人呢？……谁的悲剧更可怕：是那些因丧失劳动而生活陷于绝望的失业工人呢，还是那些仍旧劳动但没有希望的人呢？”
    遍及美国各地的经济困难，不仅仅打击了工人阶级、职员和知识分子。大公司、大垄断组织，利用目前的情况来排挤他们比较软弱的对手。用“纽约邮报”经济评论员希里维·鲍特的话来说，可怕的破产的浪潮正席卷着全国，这是近二十年来最可怕的一次倒风，每个星期就有三百家中小公司和工厂倒闭。这就是美国宣传家们所最爱大喊大叫的“营业自由”的鲜明例子。在日趋炽烈的竞争中，操胜算的只有强大的吸血鬼——垄断资本，而中小资本家是要被毁掉的。
    大公司和大垄断组织为了谋利，是无孔不钻的。这是现代资本主义的本性。它们利用失业的情况加强了对工人的剥削。它们利用市场缩小的机会，来消灭或吞并较软弱的竞争对手。它们利用军费开支增加的情况来直接牟利。
    美国工会为劳动人民生活水平的继续恶化担忧，是可以理解的。对前途的惶恐不安已达到如此广泛和强烈的程度，以致工会的领袖们不得不采取某些步骤了。劳联—产联所召开的这次紧急会议，显然就是这种步骤的开端。
    苏联劳动人民不为失业而担惊受怕，但是他们不能不同情美国失业工人的痛苦遭遇。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫说，我们当然不会因美国失业工人增加而感到高兴，失业对于劳动人民说来是真正的灾难。
    不能不指出，劳联—产联领导人所提出的某些措施，归根到底只会使美国劳动人民的生活状况进一步恶化。
    米尼在他的演讲中强调必须急剧增加用于防卫，即美国军事准备的拨款。米尼为了“论证”这个建议，再一次重复了资产阶级宣传的所谓“共产主义侵略”的诽谤滥调。他的另一个借口是说军费开支有助于建立“新的财富”，虽然大家老早就知道军备竞赛和战争一样，不会建立财富，而是要毁灭由人民的劳动所创造的大量财富。
    米尼的关于增加军费开支的建议，不是什么新鲜的东西。在不久前，在臭名昭著的“盖瑟报告”中就已经提过这个建议了。据了解，这份报告是在洛克菲勒家族及洛克菲勒集团的“纽约曼哈顿大通银行”董事长麦克洛埃的授意和直接参与下拟就的。在稍后一些时候，“洛克菲勒基金委员会的报告”又重复发挥了这份“报告”的基本论据和结论。遗憾的是米尼这样做，不过是重复了最为侵略成性的美国帝国主义集团已经再三提出过的东西。
    在这个问题上，劳联—产联的领袖们采取了甚至美国许多企业界人士都反对的立场。著名的企业家和经济学家都认为，提高军费开支不会使美国的经济健全起来。头脑清醒的美国人十分坦率地说，增加军事拨款可以改善最大的军火工业垄断组织的本来就不坏的状况，但是不可避免地会使其它的美国产业部门的状况恶化。
    经验证明，庞大的军需订货，只能引起个别产业部门的片面发展而削弱其它的产业部门。
    近一年来，在美国叫喊“充分就业”和工业“惊人增长”的声音，甚嚣尘上。但是，工业生产的这种高涨是因所谓“投资景气”引起的人为现象。这种“投资景气”是为垄断资本私利所左右的资本主义经济的无政府主义本性的特点。
    各大公司在相互竞争中，不断扩大自己的生产能力，指望借此来排挤市场上的竞争对手。例如，最大的汽车公司在扩大生产能力方面的开支竟达几十亿美元。结果，号称美国“三大公司”的“通用汽车公司”、“福特汽车公司”和“克莱斯勒汽车公司”，就能有力地排挤了实力较差的竞争对手。这样一来，汽车工业所拥有的生产能力远远超过了受购买力限制的资本主义市场的限度。最大的钢铁公司及其它许多公司的生产能力，也由于“投资景气”而有同样提高的情形。
    由于不能有利地使用这些生产能力，现在各产业公司开始大大地削减投资。在1957年的第四季度，整个美国工业的投资比上一年同期的投资减少三分之一。在重工业的公司里削减投资的情况更严重，已达到47％；冶金公司甚至削减了55％。
    米尼在他的演讲中评论目前美国经济状况时，好几次使用了“病”这个词。他说，美国的经济“染上了一种可怕的病”。他不止一次地把失业叫做“传染病”。
    这个病是在上一个世纪里，马克思在研究资本主义发展规律时发现的。天才的列宁研究过这个病。近来，在美国，人们也不得不谈论起这个“经济病”了。这个病真是毫不含糊地使企业界人士、政界人士、经济学家和工会的领袖们吃惊。实际上，近十年来这个“病”已经三次击败了美国经济。在1949—1950年，美国工业生产下降10.5％。在1953—1954年又下降10.2％。第三次的发作，将引起更严重的后果。
    马克思列宁主义教导说，资本主义经济的经济危机是不可避免的。资产阶级的理论家不愿意或者不能放弃“无危机的资本主义”的谬论。他们宣扬仿佛这样的资本主义的祖国是美国。冷酷的现实生活彻底推翻了这种谬论。
    世界两大体系（社会主义和资本主义）发展的历史经验十分确凿地证明，新社会已经永远把三分之一的人类从资本主义的可怕的瘫疽（危机和失业）中拯救了出来。新社会把生产资料交给人民掌握，永远铲除了金钱的统治和发财致富的精神，并且从剥削制的压迫下解放了劳动的人。
    伟大的美国作家德莱塞曾经怀着愤慨和悲痛的心情说，“工作——这是生活之本。不给人们工作，就会使人们陷于可怕的处境，终日心神不安”。德莱塞在看到纽约市那些神志沮丧的失业工人的长蛇阵时，写道：“他们力求在这个世界上活下去，他们许久以来就到处颠沛流离了。几乎他们所有的人在尚未丧失力量和勇气之前”，总牢记一个念头：如何能“以沉重的劳动换取一块面包，——当然总是一块少得可怜的面包”。社会主义国家的人民已经摆脱了这种由来已久的悲剧。这就表明社会主义对资本主义有巨大的优越性。我们有权以此引为自豪。
