    Illustrating Children's Books
    ——A Visit with Soviet Illustrator Konashevich
    Li Qun
    When one mentions Soviet children's book illustrations, people will immediately think of B. Konashevich, an old illustrator living in Leningrad. He not only created many illustrations for Russian folk tales, but also for Russian-language versions of Chinese folk tales. His works have left an unforgettable impression on a wide readership of Soviet children. The old man used to be a professor in the Department of Printmaking at the Leningrad Repin Academy of Fine Arts and is one of the oldest generation of printmakers (Note).
    The first Chinese artist to visit Konashevich was the late great painter Xu Beihong. He established a friendship with Konashevich during a Chinese painting exhibition held in Leningrad in 1934. Since then, the Chinese people and Chinese painting have sparked great affection and interest in the old man. This time, when Comrade Li Hua and I came to Leningrad and met him, he received us with great pleasure.
    He lives on a very high floor. After entering the house, we shook hands with the old man, hung our hats and coats by the door as usual, and were welcomed into the guest room. On the wall hung Konashevich's landscapes and still lifes, all ink paintings created with Chinese Xuan paper and Chinese brush and ink. These works demonstrated the owner's artistic interests. He said he was an enthusiastic lover of Chinese art. He then told us that when Xu Beihong visited his home in 1934, he had given him a lot of Xuan paper, and many of the works that have survived to this day were painted with these papers. In addition, they had exchanged works. Xu Beihong gave him a Chinese painting, which was unfortunately lost in the Soviet-German war, which he expressed great regret over. As for a work he sent to Xu Beihong, he heard that it had been kept in the exhibition room of Nanjing University, but he doesn't know where it is now. Later, he led us from room to room to appreciate his works and introduced us to his wife, who was reading a book there.
    His works are mostly ink paintings made with Chinese painting tools, including various still lifes and landscapes, as well as nude women. From the ink paintings of human bodies, one can see even more clearly the brilliance of his sketching skills.
    We presented him with our own works and the Chinese Xuan paper and paper-cut window decorations we had brought. He said, "The Xuan paper I'm using now is not as good as your Xuan paper." After that, he showed us the paintings on the bookshelf, and showed us the illustrations he had made for Russian folk tales, as well as the illustrations he had made for a selection of Chinese folk tales published in the Soviet Union. The Chinese folk tales included stories such as "Meng Jiangnü's Lament," "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," "The Magic Brush," "Waiting for a Hare by a Stump," "Helping Shoots Grow by Pulling Them Upward," etc. The illustrations he made for these stories were mostly pen drawings, many of which were also colored with bright colors. Although he was not very familiar with the ancient Chinese people and their lives, which made the illustrations seem lacking in the flavor of ancient Chinese life, we were still interested in his spirit of trying to absorb the essence of Chinese painting and the vividness of the characters he created. As for the illustrations he drew for Soviet children about Russian folk tales, I liked them even more, because he understood Russia better than he understood ancient Chinese life, and he used their traditional techniques when drawing these illustrations, which seemed particularly skilled and natural. After returning from his home, I had many thoughts. I think: China has not yet paid real attention to the issue of illustrating children's books. If it is said that general literary works should have illustrations, then children's books are even more necessary. Facts have proven that a children's book with beautiful illustrations can not only arouse children's interest in reading, but also help them further understand the content of the reading material, thereby benefiting them even more. Our country has many excellent children's literary works, but unfortunately, many of them have not been illustrated to date. While millions of children are yearning for excellent children's books, they are also eagerly expecting beautiful illustrations and designs. In addition, after seeing Konashevich's ink illustrations, I also thought that in terms of the form and style of children's book illustrations, there should also be variety and bold experimentation. Although Konashevich used Chinese tools and learned things from our Chinese freehand brushwork, it did not reduce the Russian flavor of his works and the author's creativity.
    I hope that China will also have outstanding painters specializing in children's book illustrations, and I also hope that more and better children's book illustrations will be produced.
      (Note) In the Soviet Union, general book illustrations are also included in printmaking.

    给儿童书籍插图
    ——访问苏联插图画家科纳舍维奇
    力群
    提到苏联的儿童书籍插图，人们就会联想到住在列宁格勒的老插图画家B·科纳舍维奇。他不仅为俄罗斯的民间故事画了很多插图，而且为俄文版本的中国民间故事也画了很多插图。他的作品在广大苏联儿童读者中留下了难忘的印象。老人过去是列宁格勒列宾美术学院的版画系教授，是最老一辈的版画家（注）。
    中国的艺术家最初访问科纳舍维奇的是已故的大画家徐悲鸿，他于1934年在列宁格勒举行中国绘画展览会时，与科纳舍维奇建立了友谊，从此中国人和中国绘画使老人发生了很大的好感和兴趣。我和李桦同志这次来到列宁格勒当我们和他会见时，他以非常愉快的心情接待了我们。
    他家住在很高的楼上，进到室内，和老人握手后，照例把帽子和大衣挂在门旁，就被迎到客室。墙上挂着科纳舍维奇的风景和静物，都是用中国宣纸和中国笔墨创作的水墨画。这些作品说明了主人的艺术兴趣。他说他是一位中国艺术的热诚的爱好者。接着他告诉我们，当1934年徐悲鸿到他家里时曾送了他很多宣纸，现在留存的许多作品都是用这些纸画的，此外他们还交换过作品，徐悲鸿送了他的一张中国画，不幸在苏德战争中遗失了，他表示非常可惜。至于他送徐悲鸿的一幅作品听说一直保存在南京大学的陈列室里，可是现在也不知道下落了。后来他领我们从这室走到那室欣赏他的作品，并向我们介绍了正在那里看书的他的夫人。
    他的作品大都是用中国画具作的水墨画，有各种各样的静物和风景，其中也有裸体女人，从人体的水墨画看，才愈加可以看出他的素描修养的高明。
    我们把自己的作品和带来的中国宣纸、窗花送给他，他说：“我现在用的宣纸，没有你们的这些宣纸好。”之后，他把放在书架上的画给我们看，并给我们看他给俄罗斯民间故事作的插图，以及给苏联出版的中国民间故事选集所作的插图，中国民间故事中包括“孟姜女哭长城”“愚翁移山”“梁山伯祝英台”“神笔马良”“守株待兔”“拔苗助长”……等故事，他为这些故事作的插图，大都是用钢笔画的，有不少还加了鲜艳的色彩，虽然由于他对于古代中国人民和他们的生活不太熟习，使我们看来这些插图还不够古中国的生活味，但他在竭力从中国绘画中吸取精华的精神，和所塑造的人物的生动性，都是使我们感到兴趣的。至于他给苏联儿童画的关于俄罗斯民间故事的插图却使我更加喜爱，因为比起中国的古代生活来他更了解俄罗斯，而且他画这些插图时使用了他们的传统的手法，显得特别熟练自然。从他家里回来，我有很多感想，我想：我们中国对儿童书籍作插图的问题，还没有引起画家们真正的重视。如果说一般文学作品应该有插图，那么儿童读物则更加必需。事实证明，一本带有优美插图的儿童读物，不仅能引起儿童阅读的兴趣，而且也能帮助他们进一步去理解读物的内容，从而使他们受到更大的教益。我国是有许多优秀的儿童文学作品的，可惜到目前为止有许多都还没有配上插图。千千万万的儿童们在渴望优秀儿童读物的同时，也殷切地期望着美丽的插图和装帧。此外，我看了科纳舍维奇的水墨插图，又使我想到在儿童书籍插图的形式和风格方面，也应多种多样、大胆尝试。科纳舍维奇虽然采用了中国的工具，并在我们中国的写意画中学习了东西，但并不因此而减少自己作品的俄国风味和作者的创造性。
    我希望我们中国也有专门从事儿童书籍插图的卓越的画家出现，也希望能产生出更多更好的儿童书籍插图作品。
      （注）苏联把一般书籍插图也包括在版画中。
