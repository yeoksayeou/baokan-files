Letter Two
Dear children:

In January of this year, I just returned from Egypt. While my memory is still fresh, let me tell you some of my impressions of Egypt.

We went to Egypt via the northern route, which means taking a plane from Beijing, passing through the Mongolian People's Republic, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and finally arriving at the Egyptian capital, Cairo. —Here, let me interject: how quickly the world situation is developing! Less than three weeks after my return, Egypt and Syria have already united to form a new country spanning Asia and Africa, the United Arab Republic! This is a further step in the unity of the Middle Eastern Arab people in their opposition to colonialism and their striving for national independence; it is also a milestone in the further progress of world peace forces!

Along the way, looking out of the plane window, all we saw was a dazzling expanse of snow and ice. But as soon as we reached the skies over Cairo, the sky was clear and cloudless. Below us were long river channels, with tributaries branching out, and orderly, verdant fields on either side. Clusters of dense, light gray farmhouses, and rows of tall jujube and willow trees lined the field ridges. But beyond this riverine area was an endless expanse of yellow sand, a stark contrast of lush green and light yellow!

This long river channel is the world-famous Nile River, the only natural river in Egypt. Egypt is located in the northeastern corner of Africa, between 22 and 32 degrees north latitude and 24 and 37 degrees east longitude. The climate is hot and rainfall is scarce, so the Nile is also their only source of irrigation. The Egyptian people affectionately call the Nile River "Father Nile," and that is the reason.

This reminds me of more than twenty years ago, when I saw a statue of the Nile River in the Vatican—the Papal City—museum in Rome, the capital of Italy. Here, the Nile River is a kind old man, his right arm leaning diagonally on a sphinx, lying on his side on the ground, with a high pile of wheat and grapes beside him. Most vividly, his body, his surroundings, are crawling and surrounded by many lively and laughing, naked children! Some are standing on his shoulders, some are riding on his arms, some are sitting on the wheat pile beside him, and some are in groups of two or three, teasing and playing with the crocodiles in the river water beside him. This statue made a deep impression on me, but I never realized that the desert area of Egypt accounts for 96% of the country's territory, nor did I know that the rainfall in Egypt is so scarce that simple farmhouses don't need to be roofed, just covered with sorghum stalks. When I saw and heard these phenomena, I couldn't help but feel love for the Nile River!

During our stay in Egypt, we took a short trip, traveling south by train, along the Nile River, upstream. What spun past before our eyes were moistened fields, lush crops, and men and women wrapped in headscarves and wearing robes, hoeing the fields, drawing water, herding sheep, driving donkeys... At the same time, we also saw farmhouses along the road. The houses were like our southern "courtyards," with windows and doors, but no roofs. It was winter at the time, and the rooms were filled with sunlight during the day, and at night we slept under the moon and stars. The air was fresh, and it must have been very comfortable.

This was extremely new to me, but I still couldn't quite wrap my head around it. I asked my Egyptian friend who was traveling with me: "In summer, covering the roof with sorghum stalks can certainly block the hot sun, but I'm afraid it can't block heavy rain and long rain; what if, what if it rains heavily, or rains for a long time?" She smiled and said, "You're worrying too much. Except for the Mediterranean coast, where there is more rainfall, we just don't get heavy rain or long rain, not even one in ten thousand times!"

The intelligent and brave Egyptian people know that in addition to relying on their "Father Nile," they must also constantly engage in arduous struggles with the climate and soil, and extract food from nature. Now their work of building water conservancy projects and developing the desert is being widely carried out. Bless them, the excellent children of the beloved Nile River!

I'll talk about other things in the next letter. I wish you all three goods!

Your friend, Bing Xin

    通讯二亲爱的小朋友：
    今年1月，我刚从埃及归来，趁我记忆犹新，来对小朋友说一些埃及的印象。
    我们到埃及去，走的是北路，就是从北京坐飞机，经过蒙古人民共和国、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克，最后到达埃及的首都开罗——在这里我插一句话，世界局势发展得多快，在我回来后不到三个星期，埃及和叙利亚，已经联合组成一个横跨亚非两洲的新国家阿拉伯联合共和国了！这是中东阿拉伯人民，在反对殖民主义，争取民族独立的愿望上，进一步的团结；这也是世界和平力量进一步进展的里程碑！
    我们一路上从机窗下望，都是冰天雪地莹白照眼，可是一到达开罗的上空，就是晴天万里，下面是长长的河道、支流四出，两旁是整齐翠绿的田野，一簇簇的密集的淡灰色的农舍，田陇上排列着一行一行的高大的棗柳树。但是在这河畔地区以外，就是茫茫无际的黄沙，浓绿淡黄，成一个鲜明的对照！
    这一条长长的河道，就是世界闻名的尼罗河，是埃及境内的唯一的天然河流。埃及在非洲的东北角，在北纬22度至32度，东经24至37度之间，气候炎热，雨量极少，所以尼罗河也是他们唯一的灌溉泉源。埃及人民亲切地称尼罗河为“尼罗河爸爸”，就是这个原故。
    这使我想起二十几年前，我在意大利首都罗马的梵蒂冈——教皇城——的博物馆里，看见了一座尼罗河的雕像。在这里，尼罗河是一位慈祥的老人，他右臂斜倚着人面狮身像，侧卧在地上，旁边堆着一垛高高的麦穗和葡萄。最生动的是他的身上，身边，爬满围满了许多活泼嬉笑的，赤裸的小孩子！有的站在他的肩上，有的骑在他的臂上，有的坐在他身旁的麦堆上，有的三三两两地和他身边河水里的鳄鱼，撩拨嬉戏。这雕像给我的印象很深，但我决没有意识到，埃及的沙漠地区，占到全国境的96％，也不知道埃及的雨量少到：简单的农舍，不用盖屋顶，只用高粱秆遮遮就行。当我看到听到这些现象的时候，我对于尼罗河，也不自禁地起了热爱了！
    我们在埃及境内，曾作过短期的旅行，就是坐火车往南走，一路沿着尼罗河，溯流而上。眼前旋转过去的，是润湿的田地，茂盛的庄稼，和裹着头巾穿着长袍的男男女女，锄地的，车水的，放羊的，赶驴的……同时也看见了道旁的农舍，屋子都像我们南方的“天井”一样，有窗有门，却没有屋顶。那时正是冬天，白日阳光满室，夜里顶着月亮和星星睡觉，空气清新，一定是十分舒畅的。
    这在我是极其新鲜的事，但心里还转不过弯来，我问同行的埃及朋友：“夏天在屋顶盖上高粱秆，当然可以挡住炎热的太阳，但是恐怕挡不住大雨和久雨；万一，万一地要下大雨，下久雨呢？”她笑了，说：“你过虑了，我们这里除了沿地中海一带，雨量较多之外，就是一万个，一万个地不下大雨和久雨！”
    聪明勇敢的埃及人民，知道除了倚靠他们的“尼罗河爸爸”之外，还得不断地和气候土壤作艰苦的斗争，向大自然索取粮食。现在他们的兴修水利，开发沙漠的工作，正在广泛地展开。祝福他们吧，可爱的尼罗河的优秀的儿女！
    别的下信再谈，祝你们三好！
                      你的朋友　冰　心
                          1958、3、15、北京
