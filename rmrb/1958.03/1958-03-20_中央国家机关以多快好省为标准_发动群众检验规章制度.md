A special dispatch from the Xinhua News Agency to our newspaper: In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, central state organs have exposed many unreasonable rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces and stifle the enthusiasm of the masses. Breaking free from the constraints of these old systems will unlock enormous potential for production and construction.

*Metallurgical Industry Department*

　　Requiring Engineering Drawings Even for Toilet Repairs
　　Analyzing Soil Even for Planting Utility Poles

Through the great airing of views and great debate, various organs not only exposed the “three winds” and “five airs” but also launched a mass movement to examine all unreasonable rules and regulations. During the airing of views, the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results became the standard for examining all systems. All conservative systems and all subjectivist regulations were criticized by the masses. In the recent concentrated airing of views to expose conservative thinking, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry exposed the dogmatic tendencies of leaders and engineering technical departments, and discovered that many rules and regulations were unreasonably formulated. According to preliminary statistics, the ministry needs to revise or abolish approximately 200 rules and regulations. Some big-character posters revealed that the “stereotyped writing style” in the department's current design work is so severe that even repairing a toilet requires submitting an engineering geological map in advance, and planting a wooden utility pole requires submitting a columnar analysis of the soil to assess the engineering geology. One unit had a discrepancy of only one fen in its accounts, but the competent department delayed settlement for three years.

*Ministry of Railways*

　　Money from Selling Lame Mules Must Be Turned In
　　Funds to Buy New Mules Must Be Allocated Separately

Some systems have clearly hindered the development of productive forces and stifled the enthusiasm of the masses to tap the potential for production and construction, but they have not been revised for a long time. Due to the overly rigid rules and regulations in the Ministry of Railways, the initiative of its subordinate production units has been severely affected. The ministry's machinery management methods stipulated that any machine tool in a railway factory, if it were to undergo production improvements or changes in purpose, or even have its installation location moved, had to be reported to the Factory Management Bureau of the ministry for approval. In 1957, a ridiculous thing happened: a cart-pulling mule in the Tangshan Locomotive Repair Factory broke its leg and they wanted to sell it and buy a new one, but according to the ministry's regulations, they had to turn in the money from selling the lame mule, and funds to buy a new mule would be allocated separately.

*Ministry of Health*

　　Many Restrictions on Conducting Experiments
　　Difficult to Mass-Produce New Products

The masses in the Ministry of Chemical Industry criticized the health departments for having too many restrictions on the medical and clinical trials of new products, which hampered the rapid increase in new products. Some health departments only trust imported foreign medicines and often purchase them in large quantities without testing; while domestically produced medicines of the same quality are required to undergo clinical trials, resulting in a new product often being delayed for two years before it can be mass-produced. Once, the Northeast region successfully trial-produced an effective drug for treating malaria, and the masses could cure the disease for only one jiao. The health departments had also successfully tested it in Yunnan, Sichuan, and other places, but because the effect was not good in Hainan Island (because there are different types of malaria), production had to be stopped even though the equipment was already available.

*Ministry of Coal Industry*

　　The More Expensive the Materials Used, the More Funds Provided
　　This Kind of Bad Rule Can Only Promote Waste

Some organs revealed that due to the unreasonable formulation of some rules and regulations, or the overly rigid regulations, they caused great waste in implementation. Staff members of the Ministry of Coal Industry revealed a system that "promotes waste." In the past, the ministry's regulations for basic construction management fees and the service fees for auxiliary workshops of construction units were extracted from the direct costs of the project at a certain percentage. The largest proportion of the direct costs of the project was wages and materials. If the materials used were more valuable and the total wages were higher, the construction unit would receive more management fees and auxiliary workshop service fees. Everyone believed that this system not only could not promote people to carry out construction in a good and economical way but also encouraged people to use expensive materials.

*Construction Bank*

　　Unreasonable Interest Rates on Overdue Loans
　　The Proportion of Overdue Loans Increases Year by Year

In the financial sector, the unreasonable formulation of many rules and regulations directly caused the waste of state funds. The People's Construction Bank of China revealed a system that only had a hindering effect: the bank stipulated that the monthly interest rate for loans was 0.2% (the monthly interest rate for industrial loans from the People's Bank was 0.6%), and if the loan was overdue, the interest rate would increase slightly. Calculated on a fund of 100 million yuan, it would only cost 20,000 yuan more in interest per month than before. However, if the procedure for renewing the loan was carried out, a stamp duty of 100,000 yuan would have to be paid. Therefore, the other party would rather pay more overdue interest than go through the renewal procedure. This has led to the proportion of overdue loans in the bank's total loans increasing year by year: 20% in 1955, 24% in 1956, and rising to 54% in 1957.

All these unreasonable rules and regulations are being rationally reformed by various organs through great airing of views, great debate, and great contention. Many organs have also noted that in the reform of the system, it is necessary to oppose both conservative thinking and the attitude of complete negation.

### 中央国家机关以多快好省为标准  发动群众检验规章制度

    中央国家机关以多快好省为标准
    发动群众检验规章制度
    本报特约新华社专稿　中央国家机关在反浪费反保守运动中，揭发出很多不合理的规章制度，这些规章制度束缚了生产力的发展，束缚了群众的积极性，破除这些旧制度的束缚，就将挖掘出巨大的生产建设潜力。
    ·冶金部·
    修厕所都要工程图样
    栽电杆也得分析土壤
    通过大鸣大放运动，各机关不仅对“三风”“五气”进行了揭发，而且形成了对所有不合理的规章制度的一次群众性的检验运动。在鸣放中，多快好省的建设方针成为检验一切制度的标准，所有保守的制度，所有主观主义的规定，都受到了群众的批判。冶金工业部在最近集中揭发保守思想的鸣放运动中，揭露了领导上和工程技术部门的教条主义习气，发现很多规章制度订得不合理，据初步统计，这个部需要修改和废除的规章制度约有二百多种。有的大字报揭发，这个部目前设计上的“八股气”实在厉害，甚至修一个厕所也要事先交出工程地质图，栽一根木头电线杆也要先交土壤柱状分析图，看看工程地质好不好。有个单位为了一笔账，收支相差只有一分钱，主管部门竟然拖了三年不让结账。
    ·铁道部·
    卖跛骡子的钱需上缴
    买新骡子的钱要另拨
    有些制度已经明显地束缚了生产力的发展，束缚了群众挖掘生产建设潜力的积极性，可是长期以来却没有加以修订。铁道部由于过去不少规章制度卡得太死，严重地影响了所属生产单位积极性的充分发挥。这个部的机械管理办法曾经规定，铁路工厂的任何一台机床，如果要进行某些生产改进或改变用途，甚至搬动机床的安装位置，都要报给部里的工厂管理局批准。1957年曾经发生了这样一件可笑的事情，唐山机车修理厂一匹拉车的骡子跌跛了腿，想卖掉重买一条，而部里按照规章却要他们将卖跛骡子的钱上缴，买新骡子再另拨投资。
    ·卫生部·
    搞试验清规戒律多
    新产品大量生产难
    化工部群众在鸣放中，批评卫生部门对新产品的医理试验和临床试验有些清规戒律，束缚了新产品的迅速增加。有的卫生部门只相信外国进口药品，常常不经试验便大量的购用；而本国出的质量相同的药品，却规定要一律经过临床试验，结果一种新产品往往要拖延两年以后才能大量生产。有一次东北地区试制成功一种治疟疾的有效药品，群众只花一角钱就可以治好病，卫生部门在云南、四川等地也已经试验成功，但是因为在海南岛试验效果不好（因为疟疾有不同的类型），结果虽然设备已经有了，也不得不被停止生产。
    ·煤炭部·
    用料愈贵给的费用愈多
    这种陋规只能促进浪费
    有些机关揭露，由于有些规章制度订得不合理，或者规定得太死，执行起来造成很大浪费。煤炭部工作人员揭发了一件“促进浪费”的制度。过去这个部规定的基本建设管理费用和施工单位的辅助车间服务费，是从工程的直接费中按照一定的比例提成；而在工程直接费中占最大比例的是工资和材料，如果使用的材料越值钱，工资总额越高，施工单位得到的管理费用和辅助车间服务费就越多。大家认为，这种制度实际上不仅不能促进人们又好又省地去进行建设，而是促使了人们使用价值高昂的材料。
    ·建设银行·
    逾期贷款利息很不合理
    逾期贷款比例逐年增高
    在财政金融部门，由于很多规章制度订得不合理，直接造成了国家资金的浪费。在中国人民建设银行揭发了这样一种只能起促退作用的制度：这个银行规定贷款利率月息千分之二（人民银行的工业贷款利率月息是千分之六），贷款逾期不还时，利息略有增加，以一亿元资金计算，每月只要比原先多支付利息二万元就可以，如果办理继续贷款的转期手续，反而要支付十万元印花税。因此对方就宁愿多付逾期利息，而不愿办转期手续。这就使得这个银行的逾期放款占全部放款的比例逐年增高：1955年为20％，1956年为24％，1957年上升到54％。
    所有这些不合理的规章制度，各机关正通过大鸣大放、大争大辩来加以合理的改革。许多机关并注意到，在制度改革中，既要反对保守思想，又要反对全盘否定的态度。
