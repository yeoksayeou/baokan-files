    Red and Expert
      (Tune: Sixteen-Character Poem)
              Red! The fire of double-anti is burning fiercely, consuming the five airs, striving to learn from workers and peasants. Thorough! Tempering must come from labor. The new Eighth Route Army starts anew today. Expert! Technical innovation is at hand, learn science, declare war on the Earth! Deep! Grind an iron pestle into an embroidery needle, submit a whole heart to the Party organization! (March 25, 1958)

    红透专深
      （调寄十六字令）
              郭沫若红！双反之火正熊熊，烧五气，努力学工农。透！锻炼须从劳动受。新八路今日又从头。专！技术革新在眼前，学科学，战向地球宣！深！铁杵磨成绣花针，向党组交出一条心！（一九五八，三，二十五。）
