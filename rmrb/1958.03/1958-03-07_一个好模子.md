    A Good Model
    Ding Zhao
    We need a strategy after three years of hard struggle. The XuShui County Committee provided us with a model. It's called a model because it is still somewhat rough and needs processing and modification.

    The main part of this model is: to regard the entire countryside as a battlefield, dividing it into first-line and second-line battlefronts. The township, village, and commune form the first line. The county committee has transferred a large number of capable cadres from various agencies to the first line. The county-level agencies are the logistics troops, supporting the first line from all aspects under the unified command of the county committee, focusing on one main direction of attack. They call this approach "strengthening the first line, twisting into one rope," "highlighting key points, combining multiple aspects, dividing battlefronts, and unified leadership."

    In the past, we often saw situations where everything was a central task, and each department acted on its own, resulting in the real center becoming non-central; or when a central task came, other departments would lock their doors and focus solely on the central task, resulting in the center becoming an isolated army. XuShui's approach is very good: the first line—the township, village, and commune—has not only a fighting force composed mainly of outstanding cadres but also a powerful logistics force organized by various departments. The commercial department procures water conservancy equipment for the first line, the political and legal departments cooperate with the first line to actively combat the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, the agricultural and forestry departments train technical personnel for the first line, primary and secondary school teachers carry out battlefield cultural and recreational activities, each performing their duties and serving the center, organically combining the center and non-center, the main attack and auxiliary attack.

    More importantly, this method fully embodies the Party's highest principle—democratic centralism. It ensures the Party's unified leadership, overcoming both decentralism and commandism. The county committee makes decisions, and various departments go to handle them separately (government departments must, of course, promote and execute them through their Party groups and members), handling them without deviating from principles or the central task. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the first line and second line, the front and the rear, the Party and the government, the Party and mass organizations, up and down, left and right, and all directions are tightly twisted into one rope, while fully playing to the enthusiasm and initiative of cadres in various positions, with soaring revolutionary zeal and lively work.

    The comprehensive leap forward in rural work requires a comprehensive leap forward in leadership methods, especially the Party's leadership methods. Standing next to the fighting ranks of the masses, beating the side drum, sounding the urgent gong, waving flags and shouting, pointing fingers and gesticulating, firing a shot here, throwing a punch there, fighting separately, and acting independently—this set of old-fashioned command methods can no longer adapt to the new situation of three years of hard struggle and a comprehensive leap forward!

    一个好模子
    定照
    苦战三年，要有个战法。徐水县委给我们提供了一个模子。所以叫做模子，是因为它还粗糙些，需要加工修改。
    这个模子的主要部分，就是：把整个农村当作一个战场，划分第一线和第二线两条战线。乡、村、社为第一线，县委从各机关抽调了大批得力干部，放到第一线去，县级各机关是后勤部队，在县委统一指挥之下，围绕一个主攻方向，从各方面来支援第一线。他们把这一套作法叫做“加强第一线，拧成一股绳”，“重点突出，多边结合，划分战线，统一领导。”
    过去，常常看到这样一些情况，或者是样样是中心，各部门各行其是，结果，真正的中心成了非中心；或者是中心工作一来，其他部门就锁上门，专去做中心工作，结果，中心便成了孤军作战。徐水的做法很好：第一线——乡、村、社，即拥有一支以优秀干部为主的战斗部队，又有一支由各个部门组织起来的强大的后勤部队，商业部门为第一线采购水利器材，政法部门配合第一线作战，积极打击地、富、反、坏的破坏活动，农林部门为第一线训练技术人员，中小学教员开展战地文娱活动，各务本业，又各为中心服务，中心和非中心，主攻和助攻，有机地结合起来了。
    更重要的是，这个方法充分体现了党的最高原则——民主集中制。保证了党的统一领导，既克服了分散主义，也克服了命令主义。县委作出决定，各部门分头去办（政府部门当然必须通过那里的党组和党员去推动和执行），办又不离原则，不离中心。在党的统一领导下，第一线和第二线，前方和后方，党和政府，党和群众团体，上下左右、四面八方，紧紧地拧成了一股绳，又充分地发挥各个岗位上的干部的积极性和主动性，革命干劲昂扬，工作生动活泼。
    农村工作全面大跃进，需要领导方法特别是党的领导方法的全面大跃进。站在群众战斗行列的旁边，敲敲边鼓，打打急锣，摇旗呐喊，指手划脚，东放一枪，西打一拳，分散作战，各行其是，这一套陈旧的指挥法，再不能适应苦战三年、全面跃进的新形势了！
