    Don't Be Short-Sighted
    For several years, the Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongbei Xie Township, Xijiao District, Tianjin, has not paid attention to livestock breeding, resulting in insufficient animal power and considerable losses to production. Especially during the busy spring and autumn seasons, the cooperative's livestock cannot be adequately distributed to meet demand. For example, there are livestock for selling vegetables and hauling manure, but not enough for plowing the fields in the spring.

    However, the cooperative's leadership still does not attach importance to livestock breeding, and the production teams are simply unwilling to breed livestock, fearing it will affect production. This is because they fail to approach livestock breeding from the perspective of production needs and development, and cannot consider the long-term benefits. As a result, about 80% of the female animals in the cooperative are not pregnant. Without breeding livestock, they have to adopt the method of "selling the old and weak, and buying the strong" to make up for the shortage of livestock. But if no one breeds, where will the strong ones come from? It is hoped that the cooperative's leadership will quickly reverse this thinking, seize the opportunity, vigorously breed, and rely on its own reproduction to supplement animal power.

    不要近视
    天津西郊区中北斜乡明星社，几年来没有注意牲畜的繁殖工作，结果畜力不足，给生产带来了不少损失，特别是在春秋两季农忙时，社里牲畜怎样调配也不够用。如目前有卖菜、拉粪的牲口，就没有春耕耠地的。
    但该社领导上对牲畜的繁殖工作还不重视，生产队里根本不愿繁殖牲畜，怕影响生产。这是因为他们不能从生产的需要和生产的发展来对待牲畜的繁殖工作，不能从长远的利益打算。因此，社内80％左右的母畜有空怀现象。不繁殖牲畜，只好采取“卖老弱，买强壮”的办法来弥补牲畜的不足。可是如果都不繁殖，强的又从那里来呢？希望该社领导上赶快扭转这种思想，抓紧时机，大力配种，靠自己繁殖来补充畜力。
