Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 29th: Phoenix, Guzhang, Hengshan and other counties in Hunan Province have adjusted their rural commercial networks and changed their service methods, saving farmers a great deal of time wasted going to market. In the half month since implementation, the turnover of each commercial unit has also increased several times compared to the same period last year.

These three counties originally had more than 100 large and small market towns, with markets generally held five to nine times a month. The most frequent market days were every three days, with attendances ranging from two to three thousand people at busier times to seventy or eighty at quieter times.

After the launch of the Rectification Campaign, these three counties broke with convention and decided to change this old form of trading. Phoenix County adopted the method of "one change, one cancellation, three establishments, and three relocations." One change meant changing the market day from every five days to every ten days; one cancellation meant gradually canceling fourteen markets with low trading volume; three establishments meant establishing purchasing and sales stores in every township, purchasing and sales points in every cooperative, and agricultural and sideline product processing plants in inconvenient mountainous areas; three relocations meant moving the leading organs of the county's commercial bureau to key economic areas, mobilizing some private merchants and peddlers in towns to move to agricultural cooperatives, and moving purchasing tools and means of production to the fields and mountains to facilitate farmers' purchase and sales. In February of this year, Hengshan County had already changed the market days of more than 70 market towns to three times a month, and also organized more than 800 peddlers to go to the countryside and mountains to carry out purchasing and sales activities, and established purchasing and sales agents in more than 50 agricultural cooperatives. Guzhang County regularly has 195 peddlers going to the countryside, each responsible for the purchasing and sales tasks of various agricultural cooperatives; and organizes handicraft workers to go to the countryside to serve the rural areas.

    凤凰等县调整农村商业网
    大量节省农民赶集时间
    据新华社长沙29日电　湖南省凤凰、古丈、衡山等县调整农村商业网，改变服务方式，为农民节省了大量因赶集而耽误的时间。实行半个月来，各商业单位的营业额也比去年同期增加了几倍。
    这三个县原来共有大小墟场一百多个，每月一般要赶集五次到九次，墟期密的三天一次，每次赶集多时两三千人，少时也有七、八十人。
    整风运动开展以后，这三个县打破常规，决定改变这种旧的交易形式。凤凰县采取“一改一取，三设三搬”的办法。一改就是将五天墟期改为十天；一取就是逐步取消十四个交易不大的墟场；三设就是乡乡设购销店、社社设购销点、交通不便的山上设农副产品加工厂；三搬就是把县商业局领导机构搬到重点经济区，动员城镇一部分私商小贩搬到农业社，把收购用具和生产资料搬到田边、山边，便利农民购销。衡山县今年2月间已经把七十多个墟场的墟期改为每月三次，另外组织八百多付货郎担下乡上山进行购销活动，并在五十多个农业社建立了代购代销员。古丈县经常有一百九十五付货郎担下乡，分别负责各农业社的购销任务；并组织手工业工人下乡为农村服务。
