    Enthusiastic Combine Harvester

    The Kustanai Region of the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union is already quite familiar to our readers. Because a few years ago, millions of young men and women from all over the Soviet Union went to this place to turn over the virgin land that had not been touched by hoes for centuries... It is in this Kustanai Region, famous for reclaiming large tracts of wasteland, that a young combine harvester operator lives - a Kazakh named Jemiiev.

    During the Soviet Patriotic War, the fourteen-year-old Jemiiev worked on the collective farm. He drove an ox cart on the grassland, working longer hours than the sun shone, and always overfulfilled his quota by 50% or even doubled it. What power drove the young Jemiiev to be so motivated? It turned out that Jemiiev's ancestors lived a nomadic life, and his father also spent most of his life on the back of a camel. It was the Soviet regime that gave them a secure and happy life. The teenage Jemiiev understood this principle, and he loved the Soviet state.

    Jemiiev worked on the collective farm as if it were a battlefield. A few years later, this young member of the Communist Youth League not only learned to drive a combine harvester, but also began to compete with Nurmanov, the most famous combine harvester operator in Kazakhstan. They competed for several years in a row, and Jemiiev won the championship three times. At this time, the reputation of the young combine harvester operator spread throughout Kazakhstan.

    In 1956, the wasteland repaid its diligent masters with an unprecedented harvest. But the machines could not harvest it all, and the grain was in danger of being lost. At this time, Jemiiev, who was working at the Pavlov State Farm, was really anxious. So he decided to apply the experience of Kuban's staged harvesting to the wasteland. He harvested two hundred hectares of land using this new method, and threshed twenty thousand quintals of wheat. This achievement earned him the title of Hero of Socialist Labor.

    In last year's harvest season, the young hero made another contribution. In order to adapt to the harvesting conditions at the time, he designed an auxiliary device on the harvesting knife to improve the combine harvester. This year, he harvested nine hundred hectares of land using the advanced staged harvesting method. Jemiiev also opened a combine harvester operator training class on the farm, training more than twenty combine harvester operators. Two of them have now become famous experts.

    Jemiiev, this young and simple combine harvester operator, has won people's love and trust with his labor achievements. This year, as the quadrennial election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is approaching, the people of Kustanai have nominated him as a candidate for representative to the Supreme Soviet.

### 干劲十足的收割机手

    干劲十足的收割机手
    苏联哈萨克共和国的库斯坦奈州，对我国读者说来，已经是个相当熟悉的地方了。因为几年前曾有千千万万的青年男女从苏联各地去到这个地方，把那多少世纪未经锄头碰过的处女地翻了起来……。就在这个因开垦大片荒地而驰名的库斯坦奈州，住着一个年轻的收割联合机手——哈萨克族人皆米耶夫。
    在苏联卫国战争的时候，十四岁的皆米耶夫就在农庄工作了。他在草原上赶着牛车，一天工作的时间比太阳照耀的时间还长，总是超额完成定额的50％或一倍。是什么力量使小小的皆米耶夫有这么大的干劲呢？原来皆米耶夫的祖辈过的是游牧生活，父亲也是在骆驼背上打发了多半辈子的时光。是苏维埃政权使他们安居乐业的。十几岁的皆米耶夫懂得这个道理，他热爱苏维埃国家。
    皆米耶夫把农庄当成战线一样地工作。几年以后，这位已是共青团员的青年庄员，不但学会了驾驶收割联合机，而且开始同哈萨克最著名的收割联合机手努尔曼诺夫竞赛。他们一连竞赛了好几年，皆米耶夫获得过三次冠军。这时，年轻的收割联合机手的声誉就传遍了哈萨克斯坦。
    1956年，荒地用空前的丰收报答了殷勤的主人。但是机器收割不过来，眼看着粮食遭受损失。这时，在巴甫洛夫国营农场工作的皆米耶夫真着急啊。他于是下决心把库班的分段收割的经验运用到荒地上来。他用这个新方法收割了二百公顷土地，打了两万公担小麦。这种功绩使他荣获了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
    去年的收获季节，年轻的英雄又立了功。他为了适应当时的收割条件，在收割刀上设计了一个附属设备，改进了收割机。这一年，他用先进的分段收割法收割了九百公顷土地。皆米耶夫还在农场开办了收割联合机手训练班，培养出了二十多个收割联合机手。其中有两个现在已经成为有名的能手了。
    皆米耶夫这个年轻朴实的收割机手，以他的劳动功绩赢得了人们的热爱和信任。今年，当四年一度的苏联最高苏维埃选举即将到来的时候，库斯坦奈人把他推选为最高苏维埃代表的候选人了。
