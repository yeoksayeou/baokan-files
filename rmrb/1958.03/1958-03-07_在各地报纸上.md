    In Newspapers Across Various Locations
    Concern for the "New Peasants"
    Over a million cadres from provinces and cities across the country have responded to the Party's call and gone to the countryside to participate in labor and training. How they are laboring and living in the rural areas is a matter of great concern. The third page of the Xinhua Daily on the 5th featured a "New Peasant Life" column, publishing eight short articles and news items, reflecting the lives and labor of the new peasants from various aspects. Some of these were written by the "new peasants" themselves. Some discussed the changes in their thoughts and feelings, while others talked about how they utilized their strengths, created new farm tools, and received praise from the peasants in their labor, etc. The content is very rich.
    Grasp the Key Link
    The Henan Daily, on the 3rd, published an editorial on the Henan Provincial Party Committee's spring work instructions, saying that these instructions are a battle call for the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The rectification high tide centered on the "double-anti" (anti-waste and anti-conservatism) is the key link of all work. Grasp the key link and everything will fall into place. We must seize this key link and advance the rectification campaign and production high tides in parallel.
    The editorial also discussed the experience of the Luoyang Bearing Factory's "double-anti" campaign, illustrating that only with ideological leaps can there be production leaps.
    New-Style Agricultural Advisors
    The ten large townships of Shiqi, Pingzhou, and others in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, which are determined to achieve a grain yield of over 1,000 jin per mu this year, recently invited thirty old farmers from the Chao-Shan area to serve as technical advisors. These advisors are all highly conscious production experts from agricultural cooperatives in the famous high-yield counties of Jieyang, Chenghai, Chao'an, etc., and were recommended by their cooperatives. The term of service as advisors is one year, and the corresponding work points are borne by the inviting townships. These advisors arrived in Nanhai before the Spring Festival, and the Southern Daily reported this novel event on the 1st.
    Sweeping Away a Thousand Years of Malaria
    The people of Lemo Township, through five years of hard struggle, have swept away a thousand years of malaria, changed bad customs, and reformed old habits. Mosquitoes and flies have disappeared, and rats and sparrows have been nearly eliminated. In the past, it was said that even immortals passing by would get "the shakes" (malaria), but now people are strong, horses are vigorous, and the yield per mu is 800 jin. The Guizhou Daily prominently reported this inspiring news on the first page on February 27th, and also published an editorial entitled "All Ethnic Groups Should Learn from Lemo Township." The editorial praised the fact that the township's bad habits and superstitious ideas accumulated over thousands of years have been basically eliminated in just a few years. It also asked, if Lemo Township can do it under such difficult circumstances, why can't other places do it?

    在各地报纸上
    关心“新农民”
    全国各省市有一百多万干部响应党的号召，下乡劳动锻炼去了，他们在农村里劳动、生活得怎样，这是大家都很关心的。5日新华日报第三版有一个“新农民生活”专栏，刊载了八篇短文和消息，从多方面反映了新农民的生活和劳动情况。其中有的就是“新农民”自己写的。有的谈了自己的思想感情的变化，有的谈到自己怎样发挥所长，创造了新农具，以及怎样在劳动中受到农民的表扬，等等，内容很丰富。
    纲举目张
    3日的河南日报就河南省委发出的春季工作指示发表社论，说这个指示是社会主义建设全面大跃进的战斗号角。以双反为中心的整改高潮，是一切工作的纲，纲举目张，必须抓紧这个纲，使整风、生产两大高潮兼程前进。
    社论并论述了洛阳轴承厂双反的经验，说明只有思想跃进，才能有生产的跃进。
    新式农业顾问
    决定要在今年亩产粮食千斤以上的广东南海县?岗、平洲等十个大乡，最近邀请了三十名潮汕地区老农到本地当技术顾问。这些顾问都是著名的高额丰产县——揭阳、澄海、潮安等县农业社里觉悟较高的生产能手，他们是由社里推荐出来的。当顾问的期限是一年，应得工分由邀请的乡负担。这些顾问春节前就到南海，1日的南方日报报道了这件新鲜事。
    一扫千年瘴疠
    倮摩乡人民奋战五年，一扫千年瘴疠，坏风改变，旧俗革新，蚊蝇绝迹，鼠雀殆尽，过去说神仙过路也要“打摆子”，现在是人强马壮亩产八百斤。贵州日报2月27日一版突出报道这个振奋人心的消息，同时发表了题为“各族人民应学倮摩乡”的社论。社论称赞这个乡的千百年来的不良积习和迷信思想，竟在短短几年内基本上消除了。并提出倮摩乡在如此困难的情况下能够办到的事，一般地方为什么不能办到呢？
