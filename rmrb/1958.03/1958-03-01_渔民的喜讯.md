    This is the first mechanized fishing gear factory in Fujian Province, possessing four workshops for hook making, fishing net weaving, rope making, and repairs.  Due to the adoption of mechanized operations, fishing gear production has increased approximately threefold compared to the past, and the quality has generally improved. Machine-made fishing nets are more uniform and resistant to pulling than those made by hand.

    渔民的喜讯
    在原厦门渔具生产合作社的基础上扩建起来的厦门渔具试验厂，最近投入生产。
    这是福建省第一座机械化渔具厂，它拥有制钩、渔绲、绳索和修配等四个车间。由于生产采取机械操作，渔具产量比过去增加三倍左右，质量也都普遍提高，机制的渔绲比用手工打的均匀和耐拉。
