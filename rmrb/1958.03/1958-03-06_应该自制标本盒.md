    Should Make Specimen Boxes Ourselves
    A big-character poster put up by Wang Liangchen of the Department of Paleogeology, Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, reads: Our school often needs a large number of specimen boxes. However, it is understood that these are all made to order from outside. I think we should mobilize teachers and students within the institute to make them ourselves. This can save a lot of expenses and also cultivate the spirit of teachers and students to cherish specimen boxes and public property.

    应该自制标本盒
    北京地质勘探学院地史系王良忱贴的一张大字报，上面写道：我们学校经常需要大量的标本盒子，但是，据了解这些都是由外边订作的，我认为应该动员院内师生自己来制作，这样可以节省大量开支，还可以培养师生爱护标本盒，爱护公物的精神。
