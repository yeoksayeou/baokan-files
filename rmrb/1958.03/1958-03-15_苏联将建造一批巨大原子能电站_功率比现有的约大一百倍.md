Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: The Soviet Union will build several nuclear power plants with power ranging from 400,000 kilowatts to 600,000 kilowatts in the next few years. That is to say, their power will be about one hundred times greater than the power of the world's first nuclear power plant built by the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet Union will build four smaller nuclear power units to study new development directions in the nuclear power industry. This was mentioned by Nikolaiyev, Deputy Director of the General Administration for the Utilization of Atomic Energy under the Soviet Council of Ministers, in an article published in the Soviet magazine "Youth Technology."

The article stated that among these giant nuclear power plants, one will have a structure similar to existing Soviet ones, and will employ modern steam turbines with a power of 100,000 kilowatts each. The steam heating process of this type of power plant takes place in the reactor, thus eliminating the most expensive component of the steam generator - the steam heater. The effective coefficient of this type of nuclear power plant is quite high.

Another nuclear power plant will be equipped with pressurized water thermal neutron (slow neutron) reactors. It is estimated that the electricity cost of this power plant will be the same as the electricity cost of a thermal power plant. The power plant reactor uses ordinary water as a moderator and heat transfer agent. The steam power generation unit will consist of several separate units, each with a power of 210,000 kilowatts. The fuel is slightly enriched uranium (uranium dioxide).

Another nuclear power plant will install a thermal neutron reactor using heavy water as a moderator and carbon dioxide as a heat transfer agent. Because of the use of heavy water, the reactor can use natural uranium as fuel, which costs much less than enriched uranium.

The author pointed out that four small power units will be used for practical experiments and research, which are currently only prospects for new development directions in the nuclear power industry.

One of the nuclear devices can be used as a mobile power station and a power unit on ships. In the second experimental power unit built by the Soviet Union, a nuclear reactor using liquid metal as a heat transfer agent will be installed. The power of this power unit will reach 50,000 kilowatts. The third power unit uses a boiling homogeneous reactor with natural circulation of the heat transfer agent. This type of reactor, in addition to generating electricity, can also partially reproduce nuclear fuel.

The fourth power unit uses a fast neutron breeder reactor fueled by plutonium. As everyone knows, breeder reactors can cause certain metals to decay into new fissionable nuclear fuels when started, and the newly produced fuel is more than the fuel that is "burned." Nikolaiyev believes that this device is extremely promising.

    苏联将建造一批巨大原子能电站
    功率比现有的约大一百倍
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联在最近几年将建造一些功率达到四十万瓩到六十万瓩的原子能发电站。就是说，它们的功率比苏联建造的世界上第一个原子能发电站的功率大一百倍左右。此外苏联还将建造四个功率不大的原子能动力装置，来研究原子动力工业的新发展方向。这是苏联部长会议利用原子能总管理局副局长尼古拉耶夫在刚刚出版的苏联“青年技术”杂志上发表的一篇文章中谈到的。
    文章说，在这些巨型原子能发电站中，有一个的构造同苏联现有的相类似，它将采用一些功率为十万瓩的现代化汽轮机。这种发电站的蒸汽加热过程就在反应堆中进行，因此就可以省去蒸汽发生器中最昂贵的部件——蒸汽加热器。这种原子能发电站的有效系数是相当高的。
    另一个原子能发电站将装置一些压水热中子（慢中子）反应堆。据估计，这个发电站的电力成本将同火力发电站电力成本一样。发电站反应堆用普通水做减速剂和传热剂。蒸汽发电装置将由几个每个机组的功率各为二十一万瓩的单独机组组成。燃料是稍经浓集的铀（二氧化铀）。
    还有一个原子能发电站将安装一个用重水作减速剂和用二氧化碳作传热剂的热中子反应堆。由于用了重水，反应堆就可以用天然铀为燃料，天然铀的成本要比浓集铀低得多。
    作者指出，四个功率小的动力装置，将用来从事实际试验和研究，目前还只是一个前景的原子动力工业新发展方向。
    其中的一个原子能装置可以用作流动发电站和船上的动力装置。在苏联建造的第二个试验用动力装置中，将安装用液态金属作传热剂的原子能反应堆。这个动力装置的功率将达到五万瓩。第三个动力装置采用的是传热剂自然循环的沸腾式均匀反应堆。这种反应堆，除去发电，同时还可以部分再生产出核燃料。
    第四个动力装置用的是以钚为燃料的快中子增殖反应堆。大家知道，增殖反应堆在开动时可以使某些金属衰变成新的可分裂的原子燃料，而且新产生的燃料比“烧掉”的燃料还要多。尼古拉耶夫认为，这种装置是极有前途的。
