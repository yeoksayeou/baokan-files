　　Stage and Screen

　　Two Styles of Concerts

　　In the Great Leap Forward in literature and art, various styles of concerts have emerged, which is a gratifying phenomenon to enliven the capital's people's cultural and recreational life.

　　The national music concert held by the Central Broadcasting National Orchestra and the light music concert of the Central Experimental Opera House each have their own characteristics. The former has made many efforts in recent years to reform the national orchestra and improve playing skills, which has enriched the colors of the national orchestra's performances. Their performances also have the assistance of ballad singers, which is even more worth listening to.

　　The light music concert of the Experimental Opera House will also satisfy the audience who like short orchestral pieces and singing. (Lan)

　　Beautiful Biography Film "Schiller"

　　"Schiller" is a great poet and playwright born in the eighteenth century in a poor German family. He represented the desires of the vast number of hungry, impoverished people who longed for freedom at that time, and wrote many passionate poems and inspiring plays to carry out arduous and unremitting struggles against the decadent society and the cruel tyrants. His achievements are brilliant. His works have always illuminated the path of the people's progress.

　　In order to commemorate this great figure, the German Democratic Republic produced his biographical documentary film, which vividly describes the extraordinary historical facts of his life. The film also uses a large number of valuable historical cultural relics and pictures, making the content richer and more fulfilling. (Yuan Xin)

　　Three Plays for Sixty Yuan

　　In the wave of the Great Leap Forward, the Beijing Film Actors Troupe spent six and a half days rehearsing three one-act plays: "Yangguan Avenue," "Blind Date," and "Three Comrades-in-Arms"; the total cost of the performance was only sixty yuan. These three plays were recently performed in many institutions in a "door-to-door" manner and received good reviews from the audience. From March 14, they will be publicly performed at the Xidan Workers' Club, Hepingli Workers' Club, and other places. Among them, "Blind Date" has been quite successful, and Beijing Film Studio has decided to make it into a movie. After performing these three short plays, the Beijing Film Actors Troupe will continue to stage one-act plays such as "Between Sisters-in-Law," and prepare to adapt the film "Visiting Relatives" and Zhao Shuli's novel "Sanliwan" into multi-act plays for the stage.

    舞台与银幕
    两种样式的音乐会
    文艺界大跃进中，出现了多种样式的音乐会，这是活跃首都人民文娱生活可喜的现象。
    中央广播民族乐团举办的民族音乐会和中央实验歌剧院的轻音乐会各具特色。前者几年来对于民族乐队的改革和演奏技巧的提高，曾作过很多努力，它丰富了民族乐队演出的色彩。他们的演出还有说唱演员的助演，更是值得一听。
    实验歌剧院的轻音乐会，对于喜爱短小的管弦乐曲和歌唱的听众来说，也会满意的。　（兰）
    优美的传记片“席勒”
    “席勒”是十八世纪出生于德国贫苦家庭的伟大诗人和剧作家。他代表着当时饥饿贫困、渴望自由的广大人民的意愿，写出了许多热情洋溢的诗篇和震撼人心的剧本，向腐朽的社会、残酷的暴君进行艰苦不懈的斗争。他的业绩辉煌。他的作品一直照耀着人民前进的道路。
    民主德国为了纪念这一伟大人物，摄制了他的传记纪录影片，生动地描述了他一生不平凡的史实。影片里并运用了大量宝贵的历史文物资料和图片，使内容更加丰富充实。　（袁心）
    六十元排三个戏
    北京电影演员剧团在大跃进的浪潮中，用了六个半天的时间，排出了三个独幕话剧：“阳关大道”、“相亲记”和“三个战友”；演出费用一共只花了六十元。这三个话剧不久前采取送上门去的方式，在不少机关包场演出，并且得到观众好评。从3月14日起，即将在西单工人俱乐部、和平里工人俱乐部等处公开演出。其中“相亲记”由于演出相当成功，北京电影制片厂已决定把它拍成电影。北京电影演员剧团演完这三个小戏后，将继续上演“妯娌之间”等独幕剧，并且准备把电影“探亲记”和赵树理的小说“三里湾”等改编成多幕剧搬上舞台。　（火苗）
