    Poets and Composers Strengthen Cooperation
    Create More Songs Reflecting the Great Leap Forward
    (Our report) The Chinese Writers Association and the Chinese Musicians Association convened a joint symposium of poets and composers in the capital on the 17th to discuss strengthening cooperation between poets and composers and creating mass songs reflecting the Great Leap Forward to meet the needs of the broad masses. More than 30 people attended the symposium, including poets Zang Kejia, Yuan Shuipai, Gong Mu, Sha Ou, and composers Lü Ji, Xiang Yu, Lao Zhicheng, and Zheng Lüsheng.
    The poets and composers frankly and sincerely exchanged opinions at the meeting. Everyone believed that the cooperation between poets and composers in the past was not close enough. Some poets were not familiar with the characteristics of lyrics, and the poems they created were not suitable for composing music; some did not pay enough attention to writing lyrics. Composers should read more poetry and can select lyrics suitable for composing music from the poems. The poets and composers expressed that they will strengthen contact with each other in the future. Sha Ou has set a plan to write fifty songs within a year; Lao Zhicheng, in addition to composing instrumental music, will compose forty mass songs, and Huang Qinghe will compose five large and small operas and twenty mass songs. The "Songs" editorial department is also preparing to hold a social event for poets and composers once a month to promote and prosper song creation. (Bing)

    诗人作曲家加强合作
    多多创作反映大跃进的歌曲
    本报讯　中国作家协会和中国音乐家协会17日在首都召开诗人、作曲家联合座谈会，座谈加强诗人、作曲家的合作，创作反映大跃进的群众歌曲，以满足广大群众的需要。出席座谈会的有诗人臧克家、袁水拍、公木、沙鸥和作曲家吕骥、向隅、老志诚、郑律成等三十余人。
    诗人、作曲家们在会上坦率而诚恳地交换了意见。大家认为，过去诗人和作曲家合作得不够紧密，有的诗人不熟悉歌词的特性，创作的诗不适于谱曲；有的对写作歌词还不够重视。作曲家应该多读诗，可以从诗中选出适于谱曲的歌词。诗人、作曲家们表示，今后要相互加强接触联系。沙鸥订出了一年内要写五十首歌词的计划；老志诚除作器乐曲外，要谱四十首群众歌曲，黄庆和要谱大、小歌剧五个，群众歌曲二十首。“歌曲”编辑部并准备每月举办一次诗人、作曲家联谊会，以促进、繁荣歌曲创作。　（炳）
