Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 30th: A joint statement was signed in Hanoi on March 27th by the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic.

The joint statement said that the government delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Romanian People's Republic held talks to discuss the issues of consolidating and developing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, as well as current international issues. During the talks, both sides reached complete agreement on all issues.

The joint statement said that the two governments expressed their determination to strengthen friendly ties and develop economic and cultural exchanges, as well as the exchange of experiences in science and technology between the two countries. Both sides will study specific measures to develop these relations.

The statement said that both sides were satisfied with the fact that the unity among the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is being strengthened day by day, and that the socialist countries have made great achievements in the work of building socialism.

In discussing the foreign policies of the two countries, the statement said that both sides believe that the realization of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and first of all the cessation of testing these weapons, the abolition of military blocs and bases on foreign territories, and the withdrawal of troops stationed abroad are extremely necessary measures to ease international tension and eliminate the danger of a new war. The statement said that both sides agreed that the implementation of the Polish People's Republic's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, as well as the proposals of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Asia and conclude an Asian collective security treaty, are of great significance for maintaining and strengthening peace.

The statement said that both sides believe that the issue of restoring German unity is purely a matter for the German people.

Both sides highly praised the important initiative of China and Korea to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, considering it a valuable contribution to the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea and the strengthening of peace. Both sides believe that the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea must withdraw their troops.

The statement expressed that both sides support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence, as well as the struggle of the Arab people and the people of many Asian and African countries against colonialism and foreign intervention.

The statement said that both sides oppose all attempts by foreign countries to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs and firmly support the Indonesian people and their government in their struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The statement said that both sides paid special attention to the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit conference during the talks. Both sides firmly support these proposals and believe that the agenda of the summit conference should not include issues that would harm the sovereignty and independence of other countries and interfere in their internal affairs.

The statement said that both sides noted that the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam have been seriously violated. The South Vietnamese authorities have repeatedly refused to hold consultative conferences aimed at discussing the organization of free and general elections, through which Vietnam should be reunified through universal free elections in accordance with the Geneva Agreements. The US imperialist bloc is conspiring to turn South Vietnam into a military base and drag it into the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement said that the Romanian people support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the reunification of their motherland and express their firm belief that this struggle will be successful.

    越南和罗马尼亚发表联合声明
    赞成在欧亚两洲建立无原子武器区
    决心加强两国友好联系和发展经济文化交流
    据新华社河内30日电　越南民主共和国政府代表团和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团3月27日在河内签署了一项联合声明。
    联合声明说，越南民主共和国政府代表团和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团举行了会谈，讨论了巩固和发展两国间的友好合作关系的问题以及当前的国际问题。会谈中，双方对一切问题都取得了完全一致的意见。
    联合声明说，两国政府表示，它们决心加强友好联系和发展经济和文化的交流，以及两国在科学和技术方面的经验交流。双方将研究在发展这些关系方面的具体措施。
    声明说，双方对下面的事实感到满意：即以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家之间的团结正在日益加强，各社会主义国家在建设社会主义的工作中取得了很大的成就。
    在谈到两国的外交政策时，声明说，双方认为，实现裁军、禁止原子武器和热核武器并且首先停止这些武器的试验、取消军事集团和在外国领土上的基地、撤出驻在外国的军队，是缓和国际紧张局势以及消除新战争危险所极其需要的措施。声明说，双方一致认为，实行波兰人民共和国关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议以及苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国关于建立亚洲无原子武器区和缔结一个亚洲集体安全公约的建议对维护和加强和平具有重大意义。
    声明说，双方认为，恢复德国统一问题纯粹是德国人民的事情。
    双方非常赞成中国和朝鲜从朝鲜撤出中国人民志愿军的这个重大的主动行动，认为这是对和平统一朝鲜和加强和平的事业的宝贵贡献。双方认为，美国和其它派有军队驻在南朝鲜的国家必须撤出它们的军队。
    声明表示，双方支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争，以及阿拉伯人民和许多亚非国家人民反对殖民主义和外国干涉的斗争。
    声明说，双方反对外国干涉印度尼西亚内政的一切企图，并且坚决支持印度尼西亚人民及其政府保卫他们的国家主权和领土完整的斗争。声明说，双方在会谈中特别注意苏联的关于召开最高级会议的建议。双方坚决支持这些建议，并且认为最高级会议的议程不应该包括那些会损害其他国家的主权和独立并且干涉它们的内政的问题。
    声明说，但是双方注意到，关于越南的日内瓦协议遭到了严重的破坏。南越当局曾经多次拒绝举行目的在于讨论组织自由普遍选举的协商会议，而按照日内瓦协议的规定，越南是应该通过普遍自由选举重新统一起来的。美帝国主义集团正在阴谋把南越变成一个军事基地，并且把它拖入侵略性的东南亚集团。
    声明说，罗马尼亚人民支持越南人民为争取他们的祖国的重新统一而进行的正义斗争并表示深信这一斗争一定会得到成功。
