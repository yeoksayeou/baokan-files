Following the concentrated exposure of bureaucracy, lethargy, arrogance, conceit, and squeamishness in millions of big-character posters, Shanghai's political and legal organs are launching a high tide of massive rectification and reform. Significant improvements have been made in the ideological style of public security, judicial, and civil affairs organs. Most leading cadres have left their offices and gone deep into the grassroots to understand the situation and solve problems. Staff members of the Public Security Bureau's Security Department studied the advanced proposals put forward by the police and promoted methods such as accepting residents' household registration applications at their doorsteps and handling household registration around the clock, which were deeply welcomed by the masses and had good results. The Social Affairs Department of the Civil Affairs Bureau, through implementing rectification by going out into the field, quickly grasped the situation, analyzed the problems, and proposed measures for production and re-education units, such as streamlining institutions, reducing personnel, strengthening management, and actively developing production, to ensure that all re-education personnel will achieve self-sufficiency in production this year.

    上海政法机关领导干部深入基层
    在数百万张大字报集中揭发官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气等现象之后，上海市各政法机关正在掀起一个大整大改的高潮。公安、司法和民政等机关的思想作风已有很大改进，大部分领导干部都走出办公室，深入到基层去了解情况和解决问题。公安局治安处的工作人员，研究了民警提出的先进倡议，推广了上门受理居民申报户口和二十四小时都办理户口登记的办法，深得群众欢迎，效果良好。民政局社会处由于实行出门整改，很快就掌握了情况，分析了问题，提出对生产教养等单位采取紧缩机构、减少人员、加强管理、积极开展生产的措施，保证在今年内使全部收容教养人员做到生产自给。
