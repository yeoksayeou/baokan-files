    Self-Revolution
    Zu Nian
    In the struggle against waste and conservatism, many professors and scientists have not only bravely exposed the bourgeois ideology in their past teaching and scientific research work, but also put forward the resounding slogan of self-revolution and striving to be leftists. This is a gratifying phenomenon.
    In this Two-Anti movement, all waste and conservative ideas must be opposed. However, from the perspective of schools, the biggest waste is being neither red nor expert. Therefore, we should focus on criticizing the bourgeois ideology in teaching and scientific research that is divorced from the actual practice of labor production. The vast majority of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, come from bourgeois and landlord families. They have not only received long-term bourgeois education in schools, but also served the bourgeoisie after leaving school. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have bourgeois ideology. The problem is to face the danger of this ideology squarely. The current trend of the development of the Two-Anti movement is described by many professors and scientists as "the situation is compelling," which is reasonable. Political ideology is a superstructure and must serve the economic base. The economic base of our society has already changed. If bourgeois political ideology still exists in everyone's mind, how can it serve the economic base? The urgent demand currently facing intellectuals is to carry out a self-revolution in political ideology.
    How to revolutionize oneself? Many scientists and professors have proposed handing their hearts over to the Party. This is the fundamental issue of self-transformation. Zhao Jiuzhang, director of the Institute of Geophysics, said: "Not speaking out what is in one's heart means reservations about socialism and the organization, and also indicates a lack of determination to transform oneself; not exposing mistakes makes it impossible to win the hearts of the masses, and even more impossible to transform oneself with the help and supervision of the organization and the criticism of the masses." Handing one's heart over to the Party is the first step in the practical action of true self-revolution. Over the past eight years, in successive political movements and ideological remolding of intellectuals, some intellectuals have already begun to revolutionize themselves and have achieved certain results. However, some intellectuals are still hesitant in the face of struggle, nostalgic for the old ways, unable to make a firm determination to revolutionize themselves, and even harbor resistance. There is also a type of intellectual who, although they have the idea of ​​transforming themselves, their transformation only remains on the surface, so they remain the same today. These ideological problems must be resolved before self-revolution can be carried out.
    Countless facts have proven that those who truly recognize the nature of our country and the development trend of the socialist revolution on the current political and ideological front, and strictly demand themselves, can progress and gradually achieve the goal of becoming working-class intellectuals. Those who are hesitant or only stay on the surface of wanting to transform will fall behind the times and even be abandoned by the people. Two roads are placed before every intellectual. Be brave, determined to make a self-revolution, and strive forward towards socialism!

    自我革命
    祖年
    很多教授和科学家在反浪费、反保守的斗争中，不仅勇敢地揭发自己过去教学和科学研究工作中的资产阶级思想，还提出自我革命、力争作左派的响亮口号。这是一个可喜的现象。
    在这次双反运动中，一切浪费、保守思想都是要反的。但是，从学校来说，最大的浪费是不红不专。因此，我们应当着重批判教学和科学研究中脱离劳动生产实际的资产阶级思想。知识分子，特别是高级知识分子，绝大多数是出身于资产阶级、地主家庭，他们不仅在学校里受过长期的资产阶级教育，而且在离开学校以后，又为资产阶级服务过。因此，他们有资产阶级思想并不足怪，问题在于要正视这种思想的危险性。目前双反运动发展的趋势，好多教授、科学家亲身实感形容为“形势逼人”，这是有道理的。政治思想是上层建筑，要为经济基础服务；我国社会的经济基础已经改变，如果在每一个人的脑子里，仍然存在着资产阶级的政治思想，又如何能为经济基础服务呢？目前摆在知识分子面前的迫切要求，是来一个政治思想上的自我革命。
    怎样革自己的命呢？许多科学家、教授们已经提出把心交给党。这是自我改造的根本问题。地球物理研究所所长赵九章说：“不把心里的话说出来，就是对社会主义，对组织有保留，也是表示自我改造没有决心；不把错误揭发出来，也无法换得群众的知心，也更不可能在组织和群众的帮助与监督批评中改造自己。”把心交给党，是真正自我革命的实际行动的第一步。八年来，在历次的政治运动和知识分子思想改造中，有些知识分子已经着手革自己的命，并且有了一定的成效。可是有一部分知识分子，在斗争的面前，还犹豫不定，留恋过去的老一套，不能痛下决心，革自己的命，甚至抱抵触情绪。还有一种知识分子，他们虽然有改造自己的想法，但是，他们的改造只停留在口头上，所以今天还依然故我。这些思想问题不解决，是不可能进行自我革命的。
    无数事实证明了，凡是真正认清了我们国家的性质，以及当前政治思想战线上的社会主义革命的发展形势，严格要求自己的人，就能进步，就能逐渐达到工人阶级知识分子的目的。那些犹豫不定，或是只停留在口头上要改造的人，将落在时代的后面，甚至被人民所抛弃。两条道路摆在每一个知识分子的面前，勇敢些，决心自我革命，向社会主义努力前进吧！
