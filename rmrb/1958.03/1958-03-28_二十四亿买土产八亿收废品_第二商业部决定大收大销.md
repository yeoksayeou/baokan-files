Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: The Second Ministry of Commerce has decided to greatly increase the procurement of native products and waste materials this year to support industrial and agricultural production and meet the needs of the masses.

    The Second Ministry of Commerce recently convened a national work conference on the procurement of native products and waste materials. It was determined that the total value of native product purchases this year would be 2.46 billion yuan, an increase of 84.9% compared to 1957. This includes 1.4 million tons of wild starch raw materials and 300,000 tons of wild oilseeds, representing increases of tenfold and eightfold respectively compared to 1957. Efforts will be made to replace all industrial oil with oil made from wild oilseeds within three to five years. Preliminary plans call for the total value of waste product purchases this year to be 800.8 million yuan, an increase of 110.4% compared to 1957. It is planned that over 80% of the waste products and materials purchased will be used as raw materials for industry and handicrafts. The quantity of major varieties alone, such as scrap copper, waste steel, miscellaneous bones, waste rubber, waste cotton, rags, and waste miscellaneous hair, will reach over 2.1 million tons, equivalent to half of the total amount of waste product recycling and utilization during the First Five-Year Plan period.

    Through airing views and discussions at this conference, shortcomings in past work, such as a lack of political perspective, production perspective, and mass perspective, were examined. It was determined that the operation of native products must implement the policy of "exhaustively organizing production, tapping native product resources, large-scale purchase and sale, and expanding utilization." It was also proposed to continue the large-scale advance into mountainous areas, organizing cadres to go up the mountains, funds to go up the mountains, technology to go up the mountains, and processing to go up the mountains, to vigorously support the development of the mountain economy and fully utilize mountain resources.

    二十四亿买土产八亿收废品
    第二商业部决定大收大销
    据新华社26日讯　第二商业部决定今年大量采购土产品和废品，支援工农业生产，满足群众需要。
    第二商业部最近召开了全国土产、废品采购工作会议，确定今年土产品采购总额二十四点六亿元，比1957年增加84.9％，其中野生淀粉原料一百四十万吨，野生油料三十万吨，分别比1957年增加十倍、八倍。争取在三年到五年内，工业用油全部由野生油料所制的油代替。初步规划今年废品采购总额八亿零八百万元，比1957年增加110.4％。计划收购的废品废料，80％以上是工业、手工业原料。其中仅杂铜、废钢铁、杂骨、废橡胶、废棉、破布、废杂毛等主要品种的数量，即达二百一十多万吨，相当于第一个五年计划期间废品回收利用总量的一半。
    这次会议通过鸣放和讨论，检查了过去工作中缺乏政治观点、生产观点和群众观点的缺点，确定经营土产的业务必须贯彻执行“千方百计地组织生产，挖掘土产资源，大收大销，扩大利用”的方针；并且提出要继续向山区大进军，组织干部上山，资金上山，技术上山，加工上山，大力支援开发山区经济，充分利用山区资源。
