Our correspondent in Kunming, 28th - Dali County, Yunnan Province, has decided to completely and thoroughly eliminate the "five pests" (snails, rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes) this year, transforming Dali into a "Five Pest-Free" county.

Currently, the county has already seen two "Five Pest-Free" villages in Toupu and Baohe, and four snail-free communes in Fotang, Xinyi, Yinqiao, and Panxi, and has halted the spread of schistosomiasis. Simultaneously, the county has basically eliminated diseases such as plague, smallpox, and cholera. Dali County is a region in the province with a high prevalence of disease, with over 60,000 people suffering from schistosomiasis, accounting for 54% of the county's population. Among the 60,000 plus patients, over 18,000 have lost their ability to work. In Guzhu Village, Sanyang Township, over 73% of the population suffers from schistosomiasis, with the majority of patients unable to work in the fields. Furthermore, schistosomiasis is also prevalent among livestock. However, the people of Dali County are confident in overcoming these difficulties. Currently, townships and communes throughout the county have launched a high tide of eliminating the "five pests." They have universally calculated the harm of the "five pests" to production and personal health by using methods of recalling and comparing. Each year, rats and sparrows consume over 6,076,000 jin of grain in the county, accounting for over 8% of the county's grain. After calculating and comparing, the masses have expressed that they will not give up until the "five pests" are eliminated.

Currently, all departments and units, as well as agricultural cooperatives, have established headquarters for the elimination of the "five pests," implementing a system of designated areas and responsibility to completely encircle and suppress the "five pests." The specific steps are: the period before the Spring Festival is designated as a month of concentrated effort to eliminate the "five pests," and in conjunction with water conservancy construction and manure accumulation, focus on digging out snails. Around the Spring Equinox, the main focus is on a concentrated effort to eliminate the "four pests," comprehensively catching rats, plugging holes, and filling nests. Before the autumn harvest, the main focus is on eliminating adult mosquitoes and flies. After the autumn harvest, clean up and thoroughly eliminate the "five pests," transforming Dali County into a "Five Pest-Free" county.

    大理县消灭“五害”有信心
    本报昆明28日电　云南省大理县决定在今年内，彻底、干净地消灭“五害”（钉螺、老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子），把大理变为“无五害”县。
    目前，全县已出现头铺、保和两个“无五害”村，佛堂、新邑、银桥、蟠溪等四个无钉螺社，而且已经制止了血吸虫病的传染。同时，全县已经基本上消灭了鼠疫、天花、霍乱等疾病。大理县是全省疾病流行较多的地方，全县患血吸虫病的达六万多人，占全县人口的54％。全县六万多病患者，其中有一万八千多人已经丧失了劳动力，三阳乡古主村有73％以上的人患血吸虫病，绝大部分患者不能下地劳动。此外，牲畜患血吸虫病的也很普遍。但是，大理县的人民有信心克服困难。目前该县乡乡社社都掀起了灭“五害”的高潮。他们用回忆对比的办法，普遍地算了“五害”对生产以及人身健康的危害账。全县每年被鼠、雀吃的粮食达六百零七万六千多斤。鼠、雀吃的粮食，占全县粮食的8％以上。经过算账对比，群众纷纷表示不灭“五害”，誓不罢休。
    现在，各个部门和单位及农业社，都成立了灭“五害”的指挥部，实行分区、分片包干到底的办法，全面围剿“五害”。具体步骤是：春节前一段时间订为灭“五害”的突击月，并且结合修水利、积肥着重挖钉螺。春分前后主要是突击灭“四害”，全面捕鼠、塞洞、填窝。秋收前主要是扑灭成蚊、成蝇。秋收后扫尾，彻底肃清“五害”，使大理县变为“无五害”县。
