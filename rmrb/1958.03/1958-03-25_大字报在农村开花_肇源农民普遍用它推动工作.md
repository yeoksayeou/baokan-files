Big-Character Posters Blossom in the Countryside
Zhaoyuan Peasants Universally Use Them to Promote Work

Editor's Note: Big-character posters are a powerful tool created by the working class in the socialist democratic life. This tool has been widely used in factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions, and has begun to be used by residents in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Practice has proven its great role in promoting work, improving the relationship between leaders and the masses, and carrying out mutual criticism and self-education among the masses. Now, big-character posters have also begun to appear in the countryside of Zhaoyuan County. Peasants use big-character posters to commend the advanced and criticize the backward, which has powerfully promoted production and work. This fact shows that big-character posters can also be widely used in the countryside. If this weapon is mastered by 500 million peasants, it will further unleash the peasants' political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, which will be of great benefit to the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program and the great leap forward plan for agricultural production.

(Our report) A simple, vivid, and powerful form of important criticism—the big-character poster—has been universally used in the countryside of Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province. Facts have proven that this is a good way to promote the continuous upsurge of production enthusiasm. Big-character posters written by literate peasants themselves and those written by others on behalf of illiterate peasants are not only posted at the entrances of agricultural cooperatives' offices but also all the way to the worksites. Some agricultural cooperatives use sorghum stalks to hold up the big-character posters and insert them into manure piles, so that members accumulating fertilizer around can see or hear others read the big-character posters while working.

The use of big-character posters began not long ago during the joint agricultural cooperative inspection of spring plowing preparations. The seedling cultivation work of the Xinzhan Agricultural Cooperative was well done, but the sanitation was poor. After visiting and inspecting, the surrounding agricultural cooperatives left a big-character poster, which read: "The seedling cultivation is truly outstanding, but the environmental sanitation is just unbearable." This made the Xinzhan Cooperative pay attention to combining production and sanitation work. In the joint spring plowing preparation inspection of the entire Yu Kuai Township, dozens of big-character posters were put up for mutual criticism and commendation. The third team of the Li Yi Cooperative did relatively poor work, and the agricultural cooperatives that visited and inspected them criticized them: "Not a small amount of fertilizer sources were found, but alas, little fertilizer was loaded on the carts. The piles are far away (there are few piles of manure sent to the fields, and the distance is far), the piles are small... The mobilization of women is also not good; it was only discovered during the visit last night"; "Although you work in two shifts, you are not as good as the second team who work late into the night and get up early. Please put in more effort and you will definitely catch up with them." The party branch secretary of the Li Yi Cooperative did not understand the situation and said in his introduction that the third and fourth teams were better than the first and second teams. He was also criticized by big-character posters, which hoped that he "would change his bureaucratic style and go deep into reality to grasp the situation." The next day, the cooperative director and the branch secretary publicly examined their failure to go deep into their work in the first and second teams. The third team immediately started sending manure to the fields.

The use of big-character posters has expanded to between teams within agricultural cooperatives and among members. On the Lantern Festival, many people from the fourth group of the second team of the Dai Long Cooperative went to the city to play. Other members immediately posted big-character posters criticizing: "The fourth group of the second team is truly something, only one person is producing today; where have the rest of the labor force gone? They went to the street for the festival to go to the fair." The content of big-character posters is also gradually developing from production to all aspects of rural life. (Attached picture)

    大字报在农村开花
    肇源农民普遍用它推动工作
    编者按：大字报是工人阶级在社会主义的民主生活中创造出来的一种有力的工具。这工具在厂矿企业和机关、学校中已经广泛使用，在北京、上海等大城市居民中也已开始使用。实践证明它对推进工作，改善领导和群众的关系，开展群众之间的相互批评和自我教育的巨大的作用。现在，肇源县农村中也开始出现了大字报，农民用大字报表扬先进，批评落后，有力地推动了生产和工作。这个事实说明大字报在农村中也能广泛运用。这个武器如果为五亿农民所掌握，就能够进一步发挥农民的政治积极性和生产积极性，这对农业发展纲要和农业生产大跃进计划的实现都有很大好处。
    本报讯　简明、生动、有力的重要批评形式——大字报，在黑龙江省肇源县农村已经普遍运用，事实证明这是促进生产积极性不断高涨的好办法。识字农民自己写的和不识字农民托别人代写的大字报，不但贴在农业社的办公室门口，而且一直贴到工作现场。有的农业社用秫秸把大字报夹上，插在粪堆上，周围积肥的社员，一面工作一面就可以看到或者听别人念大字报。
    大字报的运用，是从不久前农业社联合大检查备耕工作开始的。新站农业社育苗工作做的好，但是卫生工作差。周围的农业社参观、检查后，留下一张大字报，写着：“育苗育的真不离，就是环境卫生没法提。”这就使新站社注意把生产和卫生工作结合起来。愉快乡全乡备耕联合大检查中，相互批评表扬的大字报出了好几十张。有利社第三队工作差些，参观、检查的农业社就批评他们：“粪源找的不老少，可叹大车装的少。堆子远（送到田里的粪堆少，距离就远），粪堆小……妇女发动的也不好，昨晚参观才现找”；“虽然你们两班倒，不如二队贪黑又起早。请你们猛加一把劲，一定把他们撵上了。”有利社党支部书记不了解情况，介绍中说三、四队比一、二队好，也受到大字报的批评，希望他们“官僚作风要改掉，深入实际掌握情况要做到”。第二天，社主任和支部书记就到一、二队当众检讨工作不深入。第三队马上往地里送粪。
    大字报的运用已经扩展到农业社内队与队以及社员之间。元宵节那天，代龙社二队四组很多人进城去玩，其他社员立即贴出大字报批评：“二队四组真不离儿，今天生产的就一个人儿，其余的劳力哪去了？过节上街去赶集儿。”大字报的内容也正逐渐由生产向农村生活各方面发展。（附图片）
