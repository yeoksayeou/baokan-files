China's Most Populous Minority - The Zhuang People

The Zhuang (pronounced Zhuàng) people are the most populous minority in China. They are a relatively developed ethnic group in terms of politics, economics, and culture, totaling 7,003,000 people. They are mainly distributed in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

The Zhuang people have a long history and a developed culture. In the development of the rich land of Lingnan, the Zhuang people have made indelible historical contributions. In the common revolutionary cause of all ethnic groups in the motherland, the Zhuang people have also made important contributions. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, the Zhuang people actively participated in the anti-Qing struggle. One of the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Wei Changhui, was a Zhuang person. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Zhuang people and the people of various fraternal ethnic groups established Soviet power in more than ten counties along the Zuojiang and Youjiang rivers in Guangxi. They created the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army. One of the outstanding leaders at that time, the outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party, Martyr Wei Baqun, was an outstanding son of the Zhuang people. During the Anti-Japanese War, many Zhuang youths fought side by side with the Han people on the battlefield. During the Liberation War, under the leadership of the Party, the Zhuang people launched guerrilla warfare in the Zuojiang and Youjiang areas and established people's power, coordinating with the People's Liberation Army to liberate Guangxi.

The Zhuang people have their own national language - "Zhuang dialect." "Zhuang dialect" is beautiful and musical. In the past, the Zhuang people did not have a written language. In 1955, with the help of the state, a written language was created. 500,000 people participated in the learning, and more than 100,000 people have learned the Zhuang script.

The Zhuang people love to sing. Generally, both men and women can compose and sing their own songs. "Song Fair" is a popular collective singing art form among the Zhuang people. It is performed every year during the Lantern Festival (January 16th), the Third Day of the Third Lunar Month, the Eighth Day of the Fourth Lunar Month, and other festivals. Zhuang folk songs are the most popular and influential folk art form, singing about labor, love, and resistance to oppression, full of life. Exquisite Zhuang brocade is a handicraft of the Zhuang people, fully demonstrating the wisdom of the Zhuang people.

The Zhuang people mainly engage in agriculture, especially rice production. In mountainous areas, they also manage cash crops. The socio-economic life is similar to that of the Han people. Handicraft industry is also very developed, producing copper, iron products, ceramics, wood and bamboo ware, etc.

Before liberation, under the oppression of the reactionary rule, the Zhuang people suffered discrimination, insults, and exploitation. Many Zhuang people were forced to conceal their ethnic identity. After liberation, under the glorious illumination of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy, the Zhuang people gained the right to national equality. In December 1952, according to the policy of national regional autonomy, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, equivalent to an administrative office level, was established in the Zhuang settlement area in western Guangxi. The Zhuang people further gained the right to be masters of their own affairs. After the promulgation of the Constitution, it was changed to the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. In recent years, the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the Zhuang area have undergone tremendous development. Now, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region - a national autonomous region equivalent to a provincial level - has been formally established. This is another major achievement in China's implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy. It is a great happy event in the history of the Zhuang people, and it is also a common happy event for the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

    我国人口最多的少数民族——僮族
    僮（音壮）族是我国少数民族中人口最多，政治、经济、文化比较发展的一个民族，共有七百万零三千人，主要分布在广西僮族自治区。
    僮族历史悠久，文化发达，在开发岭南这块富饶的国土过程中，有僮族人民不可磨灭的历史功绩，在祖国各族人民共同的革命事业中，僮族人民也有重要的贡献。在太平天国革命年代里，僮族人民积极参加反清斗争。太平天国领袖之一韦昌辉，就是僮族人。第二次国内革命战争时期，在中国共产党领导下，僮族人民和各兄弟民族人民曾在广西左右江十余县建立了苏维埃政权，创立了红七军和红八军，当时杰出的领导者之一，中国共产党的优秀党员韦拔群烈士便是僮族人民的优秀儿子。抗日战争时期，许多僮族子弟在战场上与汉族人民并肩作战。解放战争时期，僮族人民在党的领导下在左右江一带开展游击战争，并建立了人民政权，配合人民解放军解放了广西。
   僮族有自己的民族语言—“僮话”，“僮话”优美，富有音乐性。过去僮族没有文字，1955年在国家帮助下创立了文字，参加学习的有五十万人，已有十多万人学会了僮文。
    僮族人民喜爱唱歌，一般男女都能自编自唱。“歌墟”，这是僮族民间广泛流行的一种集体歌唱的文艺形式，每年正月十六、三月初三、四月初八等节日都要演唱。僮族的山歌，是流行最广、影响最大的一种民间艺术形式，歌唱劳动，歌唱爱情和反抗压迫，充满了生活气息。精美的僮锦是僮族人民的工艺品，充分表现了僮族人民的智慧。
    僮族主要经营农业，特别是水稻生产，在山区，还经营经济作物。社会经济生活与汉族相接近。手工业也很发达，生产铜、铁制品，陶瓷，木竹器等等。
    解放以前僮族人民在反动统治的压迫下，受尽了歧视、侮辱和剥削，不少僮族人民被迫隐瞒了自己的民族成份。解放以后，在中国共产党的民族政策光辉照耀下，僮族获得了民族平等的权利。1952年12月，根据民族区域自治政策，在广西西部僮族聚居区建立了相当于行署一级的桂西僮族自治区，僮族人民进一步获得了当家作主的权利。宪法公布以后，又根据宪法的规定，改为桂西僮族自治州。几年来僮族地区的政治、经济、文化都有了巨大的发展。现在正式成立了广西僮族自治区——相当于省一级的民族自治地方，这是我国推行民族区域自治政策的又一重大成就，是僮族人民历史上一件大喜事，也是全国各族人民共同的大喜事。
