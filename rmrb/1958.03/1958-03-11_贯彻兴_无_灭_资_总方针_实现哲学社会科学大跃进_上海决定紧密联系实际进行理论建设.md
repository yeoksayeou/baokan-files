Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 10th: Shanghai's philosophers and social scientists have decided to immediately begin theoretical construction with a revolutionary spirit closely linked to China's reality, vigorously cultivate the Party's theoretical ranks, and simultaneously carry out systematic criticism of bourgeois academic thought, demanding that Marxist leadership be established in the field of philosophy and social sciences within five years. This is the plan determined at the joint meeting of the councils of nine Shanghai philosophical and social science societies held on the 9th to strive for a great leap forward in philosophy and social sciences.

The meeting determined that the scientific research of all philosophical and social science research units and university teaching and research sections should change direction, first paying attention to summarizing the basic experiences of our country's revolution and construction, and studying practical problems, such as the theory of two types of contradictions, the issue of accumulation and distribution, the issue of free markets, the experience of transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the issue of the Chinese revolutionary legal system, and so on. Business departments should also pay attention to summarizing work to make experience theoretical. Within five years, Shanghai local scientific research institutions and universities should complete a variety of works, such as the history of imperialist aggression in Shanghai, the history of religious aggression in Shanghai, the history of the Shanghai workers' movement, and the history of the emergence, development, and transformation of Shanghai capitalism.

Currently, the liberal arts departments in Shanghai universities have begun to reform philosophy and social science education, especially reforming the basic theoretical courses with the strongest political nature. The meeting decided that all philosophy and social science courses should be reformed within five years, and textbooks closely linked to China's reality should be compiled on the basis of curriculum reform. The compilation of textbooks on the theory of state and law, the socialist part of political economics, an introduction to new literature, and an introduction to literature will begin this year.

On the academic ideological front, it was decided to criticize the pragmatic philosophy, the legal science of the school of social jurisprudence, the reactionary theories of bourgeois political science and democratic socialism represented by Laski, and Keynesian economics, and other bourgeois academic trends that have a greater practical significance and deeper influence in academic circles in China, especially in Shanghai, and to continuously criticize revisionism in various disciplines, demanding that bourgeois academic thought with a greater influence be basically eliminated within five years.

Through the criticism of bourgeois academic thought and theoretical construction linked to practice, it is required to cultivate a contingent of 300 to 500 Marxist-Leninist theorists who are both red and expert within five years.

Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, analyzed the new situation of the current rectification movement at the meeting on the 9th, and asked philosophers and social scientists to implement the general policy of promoting "proletarian ideology" and eliminating "bourgeois ideology" under the leadership of the Party, and strive to achieve a great leap forward in philosophy and social sciences.

Philosophers and social scientists spoke at the meeting one after another, exchanged information and their plans, and unanimously expressed their full confidence in achieving a great leap forward in philosophy and social sciences under the leadership of the Party.

In order to facilitate the development of academic activities, the Shanghai Federation of Philosophy and Social Science Societies was officially established at today's meeting, and the famous linguist and president of Fudan University, Chen Wangdao, was elected as the president of the Federation. The meeting also determined that comprehensive cooperation should be implemented among relevant universities, scientific research units, and business departments in theoretical construction, teaching reform, and cadre training.

    贯彻兴“无”灭“资”总方针
    实现哲学社会科学大跃进
    上海决定紧密联系实际进行理论建设
    新华社上海10日电　上海哲学社会科学家们决定，立即开始以革命的精神紧密联系中国实际进行理论建设工作，大力培养党的理论队伍，同时开展系统的资产阶级学术思想批判，要求五年内在哲学社会科学领域内确立马克思主义的领导权。这是9日举行的上海九个哲学社会科学学会理事联合会议确定的争取哲学社会科学大跃进的计划。
    这个会议确定，所有哲学社会科学研究单位和大学教研组的科学研究都要改变方向，首先注意总结我国革命和建设中的基本经验，研究现实问题，如两类矛盾学说、积累与分配问题、自由市场问题、资本主义工商业的改造经验、中国革命法制问题等等。业务部门也应注意总结工作，使经验理论化。五年内，上海地方科学研究机构和高等学校要完成上海帝国主义侵略史、上海宗教侵略史、上海工人运动史、上海资本主义发生发展和改造史等多种著作。
    目前，上海高等学校中的文科院系已开始改革哲学社会科学教育，特别是改革政治性最强的基本理论课程。会议决定，五年内哲学社会科学方面的全部课程都要进行改革，在课程改革的基础上编写出紧密联系中国实际的教科书。今年就开始编写国家与法的理论、政治经济学社会主义部分、新文学概论、文学概论等教科书。
    在学术思想战线上，决定对于在中国特别是在上海学术界现实意义较大影响较深的实用主义哲学、社会法理学派的法学、以拉斯基为代表的资产阶级政治学和民主社会主义的反动理论、凯因斯的经济学等等资产阶级学术思潮，进行批判，并且连续批判各门学科中的修正主义，要求五年内基本肃清有较大影响的资产阶级学术思想。
    通过资产阶级学术思想批判和联系实际的理论建设，要求五年内培养出一支三百至五百人的又红又专的马列主义理论队伍。
    中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显9日在会议上分析了当前整风运动的新形势，要求哲学社会科学工作者在党的领导下贯彻兴“无”灭“资”的总方针，努力实现哲学社会科学的大跃进。
    哲学社会科学工作者们纷纷在会上发言，交流了情况和他们的打算，一致表示完全有信心在党的领导下实现哲学社会科学的大跃进。
    为了便于开展学术活动，在今天的会议上正式成立了上海市哲学社会科学学会联合会，著名语言学家、复旦大学校长陈望道被选为联合会主席。会上还确定在理论建设、教学改革、培养干部等工作上，各有关的高等学校、科学研究单位、业务部门实行全面协作。
