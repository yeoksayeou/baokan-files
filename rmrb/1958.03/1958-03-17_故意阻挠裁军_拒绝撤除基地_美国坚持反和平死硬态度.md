Xinhua News Agency, March 16th, Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on March 15th regarding the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement of March 14th on disarmament issues, attempting to conceal the fact revealed by the Soviet Union: that the United States' plan to convene the United Nations Disarmament Commission and transfer the disarmament issue to the Security Council is intended to divert public attention from the issue of holding an East-West summit meeting and to create new obstacles to resolving the disarmament issue.

The State Department's statement engaged in the same old slander against the Soviet Union's position of actively seeking to ease international tensions and resolve the disarmament issue. The statement shows that the United States is attempting to use the United Nations signboard to forcibly implement its plan. Despite the Soviet Union's exposure of the destructive nature of this plan, the State Department still insists on convening a so-called "expanded" United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting composed of member states participating in Western military blocs to discuss the disarmament issue, and reiterated its hope that the Security Council would hold a so-called "procedural meeting" on disarmament issues, attempting to deepen divisions and obstruct the genuine resolution of the problem. In referring to the summit conference, the statement once again stated that the United States would only agree to hold such a meeting if "preparatory work demonstrates that the meeting can ultimately reach an agreement."

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th, Washington dispatch: According to the United Press, U.S. State Department officials stated on March 15th that they rejected the Soviet Union's proposal of March 15th to include the removal of foreign military bases on the territories of various countries, especially the territories of European, Middle Eastern and North African countries, as part of an outer space agreement. These officials stubbornly insisted that this part of the Soviet proposal was an "unacceptable condition."

    故意阻挠裁军　拒绝撤除基地
    美国坚持反和平死硬态度
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院15日就苏联外交部14日关于裁军问题的声明发表声明，竭力掩饰苏联所揭露的事实：美国策划召开联合国裁军委员会并把裁军问题转交给安全理事会，是要转移公众对举行东西方最高级会议问题的注意和制造不利于解决裁军问题的新障碍。
    国务院的声明对苏联积极谋求缓和国际紧张局势和解决裁军问题的立场进行老一套的诬蔑。声明表明美国企图利用联合国的招牌来强行实现美国的计划。尽管苏联已经揭露了这个计划的破坏性实质，国务院仍然坚持要召开由参加西方军事集团的成员国占多数的国家组成的所谓“扩大的”联合国裁军委员会会议来讨论裁军问题，并且重申希望由安全理事会举行有关裁军问题的所谓“程序性会议”，企图这样来加深分歧和阻挠问题的真正解决。在谈到政府首脑会议时，声明再次表示要“事先的准备工作说明这次会议最后能达成协议”，美国才赞成举行这种会议。
    据新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：据合众社报道，美国国务院官员15日表示拒绝苏联15日所提的关于把撤除各国领土上的外国军事基地，首先是欧洲、中近东和北非国家领土的外国军事基地作为外层空间协议的一个部分的建议，这些官员硬说苏联的这一部分建议是“完全不能接受的条件”。
