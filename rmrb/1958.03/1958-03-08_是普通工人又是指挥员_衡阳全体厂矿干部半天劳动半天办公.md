Xinhua News Agency, Hengyang, 7th: The Hengyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently instructed all factories and mines in the city to promote the experience of the management cadres of the granular fertilizer plant, who spend half a day in the office and half a day participating in production, so that all cadres become ordinary laborers and production commanders.

The Hengyang Municipal Local State-Owned Granular Fertilizer Plant has 130 employees and 8 management cadres. Most of these cadres lacked production experience in the past, and when preparing plans and production quotas, they never went deep into the lower levels, harboring conservative ideas of fearing that the plans would be too large and the quotas too high, making it impossible to complete the tasks. In February, Cai Youfa, the factory director and party branch secretary of this factory, led all the cadres of the factory to go deep into various workshops to participate in production. They first participated in the labor of picking and transporting night soil raw materials. In the past, the quota for carrying a load of night soil for three *li* was three hours. Now, they themselves experimented and found that a round trip generally only takes thirty-five minutes. Even those with weaker physical strength only need forty-five minutes for each trip. In practice, factory director Cai Youfa discovered that the factory's production potential was still very large, and immediately organized discussions on new production plans. As a result, the total output value in 1958 increased from 1.51 million yuan to 3 million yuan, a tenfold increase compared to 1957. All quotas have also been revised.

    是普通工人又是指挥员
    衡阳全体厂矿干部半天劳动半天办公
    据新华社衡阳7日电　中共衡阳市委最近指示全市各厂矿推广颗粒肥料厂管理干部半天办公，半天参加生产的经验，以便使所有干部成为普通的劳动者又是生产指挥者。
    衡阳市地方国营颗粒肥料厂有职工一百三十人，管理干部八人。这些干部大部分人由于过去缺乏生产经验，加以编制计划和生产定额时，总是不深入下层，存在着怕计划大、定额高，完不成任务的保守思想。2月间，这个厂的厂长兼党支部书记蔡友发带领全厂干部，深入各个车间参加生产。他们首先参加挑运大粪原料的劳动。过去，每次挑运一担大粪走三华里，定额是三小时。现在他们自己试验，往返一次一般只要三十五分钟就够。即使体力较弱的，每挑一次也只要四十五分钟。在实践中，厂长蔡友发发现本厂生产潜力还很大，随即组织讨论新的生产计划。结果，1958年生产总值由一百五十一万元提高到三百万元，比1957年增加十倍。各项定额也都重新修订了。
