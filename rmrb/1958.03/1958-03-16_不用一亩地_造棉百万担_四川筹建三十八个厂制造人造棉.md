Producing a Million Dan of Cotton Without Using an Acre of Land
Sichuan Plans to Build Thirty-Eight Factories to Manufacture Artificial Cotton

(Our Report) Sichuan Daily reports: Without using a single acre of farmland, Sichuan Province can produce at least 2.5 million dan of artificial cotton annually from the stem fibers of wild plants. This amount is equivalent to the yield of 8 million mu of cotton fields, more than one and a half times the total cotton production of Sichuan Province last year.

The vast majority of this artificial cotton is made from the stems of wild plants. After testing, the raw materials that can be used include: cotton stalk bark, thatching grass, paper mulberry bark, mulberry bark, kudzu vine, jute, kenaf, oleander bark, Pennisetum flaccidum, rice straw, kenaf, ramie and dozens of others.

The Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has initially planned to build eight processing plants with a daily output of 1,800 dan each (of which Dazhou and Santai will be put into production this year) and thirty plants with a daily output of 30 dan each, starting this year in areas such as Suining, Santai, Mianyang, Nanchong, Fuling, Dazhou, and Wanxian. In addition, the simplest processing plants will be set up in mountainous areas to obtain materials locally, process them locally, and solve the problem of cotton for clothing and bedding for the local people. The province plans to produce at least 150,000 dan of artificial cotton this year.

    不用一亩地　造棉百万担
    四川筹建三十八个厂制造人造棉
    本报讯　四川日报消息：不必动用一亩田地，四川省一年至少可以从野生植物的茎秆纤维中，制造出两百五十万担人造棉。这个数字可抵八百万亩棉田产量；相当于四川省去年棉花总产量的一倍半还多。
    这些人造棉绝大部分都是以野生植物的茎秆作为原料。经过试验可作原料的有：棉秆皮、蓑草、构皮、桑皮、葛藤、牛尾麻、老虎麻、夹竹桃皮、芭草麻、稻草、藿麻、水麻等几十种。
    四川省供销社初步规划，从今年开始在遂宁、三台、绵阳、南充、涪陵、达县、万县等地区兴建能够日产一千八百担的加工厂八个（其中达县和三台的今年就可以投入生产）、日产三十担的三十个。另外，还要在山区举办最简易的加工厂，就地取材，就地加工，就地解决当地人民衣絮用棉。全省计划今年至少要生产出十五万担人造棉。
