    Six Days to Repair a Locomotive
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th – Workers at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory recently set a national record of repairing a locomotive in six days for medium repairs.
    The locomotive repair production cycle (number of days for repair) of this factory has always been the most advanced among railway factories nationwide. Last year, the average time for major and medium locomotive repairs was 13.9 days. During the Great Leap Forward in production, the locomotive medium repair production cycle was continuously shortened. In early February, the number of days for repairing a locomotive was shortened from about ten days to eight days, and on February 11th, it was further shortened to seven days.
