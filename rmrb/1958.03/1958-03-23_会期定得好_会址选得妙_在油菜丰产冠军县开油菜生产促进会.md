Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd. The National Rapeseed Production Promotion Conference was held from the 20th to the 22nd in Xinghua County (located in northern Jiangsu), the county with the highest rapeseed yield per unit area in the country. Representatives from the agricultural departments of major rapeseed-producing provinces across the country, including Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, visited Duotian Township in Xinghua County for on-site observation.

After the on-site visit and discussion, the representatives unanimously agreed that Xinghua County has relatively complete and systematic experience in rapeseed cultivation and management. The outstanding features of this experience are: in the early stages of rapeseed growth, all efforts are made to protect seedlings over the winter, such as cultivating strong seedlings, dense planting, and transplanting, striving to ensure the safe overwintering of rapeseed seedlings, achieving full, uniform, and even seedlings, laying a good foundation for rapeseed seedling growth. After overwintering, efforts are concentrated on promoting vigorous seedling development, creating a four-stage topdressing method based on mud slurry according to the growth requirements of rapeseed, enabling seedlings to quickly achieve stable roots, tillering, abundant flowering, abundant pod formation, and full grains.

The representatives believed that Xinghua's high-yield rapeseed experience is basically of national significance for promotion, especially the later stage cultivation management and flowering topdressing experience, which has more practical significance for the current rapeseed yield increase, and all regions can take immediate action. The representatives believed that the leadership of Xinghua County has a clear understanding of the idea that the current rapeseed yield can be greatly increased, and that there are dedicated personnel at all levels responsible for ensuring that the yield-increasing measures are implemented to the end, which is also a very important condition for rapeseed yield increase.

Xinghua County's rapeseed yield was already very high. In 1957, the county's 52,561 mu of rapeseed yielded an average of 185.4 jin per mu, more than 270% of the national average rapeseed yield, making it the area with the highest rapeseed yield per unit area in the country. Recently, the Xinghua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has made serious research on striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest this year, taking various effective measures to leap the originally set target of 220 jin per mu to 300 jin, and striving for 350 jin.

The representatives pointed out that based on the current rapeseed growth situation and actual enthusiasm in Xinghua, it is possible to achieve this advanced yield-increasing target. The representatives also reflected that the leading comrades in a few places in their own provinces still do not have enough compared to Xinghua in terms of the leap forward in rapeseed yield increase, and need to add an extra push at this critical moment.

During the three-day visit and discussion activities, the representatives had a deeper understanding of the importance of oil crop production. They unanimously agreed that there is great potential for rapeseed yield increase, and oil crops must also leap forward together with grain and cotton production. Some representatives preemptively sent telegrams back to their provinces before the end of the meeting, asking their provinces to take emergency measures to leap forward the rapeseed yield. The representatives said: Xinghua County's rapeseed yield can leap forward, and we can also leap forward. Although time is tight, the current increase in rapeseed yield is not a foregone conclusion, but there is still much that can be done. At present, rapeseed growth has entered a vigorous development stage and is beginning to bloom, and there is only a short month and a half left until the harvest period. The current topdressing during the flowering period, pest control, and drought prevention work are the main key to determining whether this year's rapeseed yield can leap forward again. As long as we muster our energy and do these tasks well, and ensure timely, meticulous, and complete harvesting, a bumper rapeseed harvest is entirely possible.

    会期定得好　会址选得妙
    在油菜丰产冠军县
    开油菜生产促进会
    新华社22日讯　全国油菜生产促进会议20日到22日在全国油菜单位产量最高的兴化县（位于江苏北部）召开。出席会议的全国油菜主要产区四川、陕西、湖南、湖北、江苏、浙江、安徽等省农业厅的代表在兴化垛田乡进行了现场参观。
    代表们在现场参观以后，经过讨论，一致认为：兴化县对油菜的栽培管理有比较完整而且系统的经验，这些经验突出的表现是：在油菜生长的前期是全力保苗越冬，如培植壮苗、密植、移栽，力争菜苗安全过冬，做到苗全、苗匀、苗齐，打下菜苗生长的良好基础。越冬以后，是集中力量促使菜苗发育旺盛，按照油菜生长的要求创造了以泥浆为主的四次分期追肥法，使得菜苗迅速的达到稳根、发?、开花多、结荚多、子粒饱满。
    代表们认为兴化油菜高产的经验，基本上是有全国推广意义的，特别是后期的栽培管理与花期追肥的经验，对于当前的油菜增产更有它的现实意义，各地立刻就可行动起来。代表们认为兴化县的领导上对于当前油菜产量可以大大跃进一步的思想很明确，而且层层有专人负责，增产措施贯彻到底，这也是油菜增产很重要的一个条件。
    兴化县油菜产量本来就很高，1957年全县五万二千五百六十一亩油菜，平均亩产一百八十五点四斤，为全国油菜平均产量270％以上，成为全国油菜单位产量最高的地区。最近，中共兴化县委会对争取当年油菜产量丰收又作了认真的研究，采取各种有力措施，把原订的每亩达到二百二十斤的增产指标跃进到三百斤，并争取三百五十斤。
    代表们指出：根据兴化当前油菜生长的情况与实际干劲，这个先进的增产指标是有可能实现的。代表也反映他们自己省内少数地方的领导同志，对于油菜增产的跃进，与兴化相比还有不够的地方，需要在这紧要时机加上一把劲。
    在三天的参观与座谈的活动中，代表们对于油料作物生产的重要性有了较深刻的认识。他们一致认为：油菜的增产潜力很大，油料作物也必须与粮、棉生产一齐向前跃进。有的代表在会议没有结束时，就抢先发电报回去，要本省采取紧急措施，把油菜的产量向前跃进一步。代表们表示：兴化县油菜增产能够跃进，我们也能跃进。时间虽然紧迫，可是当前油菜的增产不是大局已定，还是大有可为。目前油菜生长已进入发育旺盛开始放花的阶段，距收获期只有短短的一个半月时间，当前的花期追肥、防虫、防旱等工作，是决定今年油菜产量能不能再跃进一步的主要关头。只要鼓足干劲，抓紧做好这些工作，并在收获时做到适时、精细、颗粒归家，油菜的丰产是完全可能的。
