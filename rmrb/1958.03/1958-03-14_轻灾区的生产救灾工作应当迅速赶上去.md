Production and Disaster Relief Work in Lightly Affected Areas Should Catch Up Quickly
*People's Daily* Commentator

Judging from the current situation, the disaster relief work in many lightly affected areas lags behind that of the severely affected areas.

Last year, although the disaster situation in Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions was very serious, under the strong leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, and after several months of hard struggle, especially through carrying out socialist education among the disaster victims, everyone realized that the fundamental way to overcome disasters is to advance towards nature. Therefore, under the call of “changing the face of nature” and “removing the label of disaster area,” a surging production upsurge centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation was launched, and, like other parts of the country, a great leap forward in agricultural production emerged. At the same time, the government and agricultural cooperatives made proper arrangements for the lives of the disaster victims: the houses that collapsed in the flood-stricken areas have been basically repaired, and those that have not been repaired have also been provided with housing; the supply of grain, relief funds, and the distribution of winter clothing have all been carried out in a timely manner. In particular, mutual aid and mutual assistance among the masses have been widely carried out: the masses in the non-disaster areas of Henan Province sent support materials to the disaster areas to the accompaniment of gongs and drums; the masses in various parts of Inner Mongolia also provided great support to the disaster-stricken pastoral areas in terms of adjusting pastures, raising livestock on behalf of others, and donating fodder. This further encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the disaster victims, and those negative, fearful, and relief-dependent thoughts were effectively overcome. At present, the masses are continuing to work hard with full confidence in completely overcoming the disaster and striving for a bumper harvest this year.

However, the situation in many lightly affected areas is not satisfactory. In some lightly affected areas, the movement for a great leap forward in production has not been well launched, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to eliminate disasters has not been aroused, the masses cannot see the future, have many concerns, and have complex ideological problems. This is the main manifestation of the poor work in the lightly affected areas. In some lightly affected areas, although water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movements are good, the development of sideline production is insufficient, and the disaster victims cannot obtain real income, which increases the difficulty of surviving the disaster. The grain supply work in some areas has been slow, and coupled with the insufficient education of the masses on thrift and frugality, and saving grain, some of the masses have consumed more grain than planned. The distribution of relief funds in some areas has been untimely and used improperly, so that the difficulties of the disaster victims have not been resolved. Some have not even been able to grasp the situation. Because the disaster relief work in these areas has not been done well, the disaster situation has not been alleviated, and the difficulties in the production and life of the disaster victims are still many. This will not only affect the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also cause the disaster situation to develop.

In principle, the work in lightly affected areas should be done better than that in severely affected areas. They have suffered less from the disaster, have fewer difficulties, and have better conditions for self-reliance in production. However, the production and disaster relief work in these lightly affected areas is not as good as that in the severely affected areas. This is a very abnormal phenomenon. Why does this phenomenon occur? First of all, there is one-sidedness in the leadership's thinking. They only focused on the severely affected areas (which is correct), but relaxed their efforts in the lightly affected areas. They do not understand that these disaster areas are called lightly affected areas only in comparison with the severely affected areas, and that the masses in these areas all have certain difficulties in production and life. Therefore, the work in these areas cannot be ignored. Neglecting it will inevitably turn a light disaster into a heavy one. This is not just a lesson of one year. But some leaders have not realized the serious significance of this lesson, and they are still paralyzed and careless, and ignore the work in the lightly affected areas. Secondly, the situation has not been accurately grasped. What was originally a severely affected area was considered a lightly affected area. Although the floods in some areas last year were not severe, droughts occurred later. On the whole, the disaster situation was not light, but the leadership underestimated this and did not arrange work according to the standards for severely affected areas, resulting in a passive situation in the work. Furthermore, the various tasks in a few lightly affected areas have not been arranged in a coordinated manner, and the combination of water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and sideline production is not good. In addition, a small number of cadres lack a high degree of responsibility to the disaster-stricken farmers, which is also an important reason for neglecting the work in the lightly affected areas.

This phenomenon of neglecting the lightly affected areas should not exist in the current situation of a great leap forward in production. The party and government leaders in the relevant areas should attach sufficient importance to it, overcome paralysis, make comprehensive arrangements for the work in the disaster areas, and take effective measures to quickly catch up with the work in the lightly affected areas. It is necessary to organize forces to go deep into the grassroots to conduct inspections household by household and cooperative by cooperative. Check the production movement, check the unified purchase and sale, check the relief, check the diseases, check the livestock protection, check the blind outflow... etc. The main purpose of the inspection is to find out the reasons and study the methods of improvement. Effective methods should be taken immediately to solve the problems that have been discovered. If there are no cadres to be in charge of disaster relief work, a special person should be designated to be responsible for this work immediately; while grasping spring plowing and production, sideline production should also be appropriately developed. If the grain supply and relief work have not been done well, arrangements should be made quickly. Only in this way can the current backward state of the lightly affected areas be quickly reversed, and the situation of a great leap forward in production can be universally formed in all disaster areas.

While attaching importance to the lightly affected areas, we must not neglect the severely affected areas. In particular, the situation in some backward townships and cooperatives in the severely affected areas is similar to that of the aforementioned lightly affected areas, which deserves the attention of all localities. At present, it is the spring famine season, when the disaster victims have the most difficulties. No matter whether it is a light or severe disaster area, we should be vigilant, pay close attention to the development and changes of the famine situation, and do a good job in disaster relief work, so as to completely overcome the spring famine. Under the impetus of the nationwide rural production great leap forward, the enthusiasm and drive of the cadres and masses in the disaster areas are immeasurable. As long as the leadership grasps this work from beginning to end, any difficulties can be conquered.

    轻灾区的生产救灾工作应当迅速赶上去
    本报评论员
    从当前某些情况来看，不少轻灾区的救灾工作，落后于重灾区的工作了。
    去年，山东、河南、江苏、黑龙江、内蒙古等省区的灾情虽然很重，但在各级党政大力领导之下，经过几个月的艰苦奋斗，特别是在灾民中开展了社会主义教育，使大家认识到：克服灾荒的根本办法，就是向自然进军，因此在“改变自然面貌”“摘掉灾区帽子”的号召下，大家掀起了汹涌澎湃的以兴修水利和积肥为中心的生产高潮，和全国其他地区一样，出现了农业生产大跃进的局面。同时，政府和农业社对灾民的生活也作了妥善安排：水灾区倒塌的房屋，已经基本上修复，未修复的也调剂了住房；粮食供应、救济款和寒衣的发放，也都及时进行。特别是群众间的互助互济，有了广泛的开展：河南省非灾区的群众，敲锣打鼓的把支援物资送到灾区；内蒙古各地群众对受灾牧区，在调剂草场、代养牲畜、赠送饲草上，支援也很大。这样，就更加鼓舞了灾民的革命干劲，那些消极畏难、依赖救济的思想得到了有效的克服。目前群众正满怀信心地为彻底战胜灾荒、争取今年大丰收而继续努力。
    可是，不少轻灾区的情况却不能令人满意。有的轻灾区生产大跃进的运动没有很好地发动起来，没有鼓起群众的消灭灾荒的革命干劲，群众看不见前途，顾虑多，思想问题复杂，这是轻灾区工作不好的主要表现。有的轻灾区水利建设和积肥运动虽然还好，但副业生产开展不够，灾民不能得到现实的收入，增加了渡荒的困难。有的粮食供应工作做得缓慢，加之教育群众勤俭持家、节约用粮不够，以致部分群众吃粮超过了计划。有的救济款发放不及时，使用不当，致使灾民的困难得不到解决。有的甚至连情况也掌握不起来。由于这些地区救灾工作做得不好，因而灾情并没有减轻，灾民生产和生活中的困难还很多。这样，不但农业生产大跃进要受影响，而且使灾情有所发展。
    按理说，轻灾区的工作应该搞得比重灾区好，他们受灾较轻，困难较少，生产自救的条件比较好。但是，这些轻灾区的生产救灾工作还不如重灾区。这是一种极不正常的现象。为什么会产生这种现象呢？首先是领导思想上存在着片面性。他们只抓住了重灾区（这是对的），却放松了轻灾区。他们不了解，这些灾区之所以叫轻灾区，只是与重灾区比较来说的，这些地区的群众生产和生活上，都存在着一定的困难。因此，对这些地区的工作同样不能忽视。忽视了就必然使轻灾变重。这已经不是一年的教训。可是有些领导者并没有认识到这种教训的严重意义，他们依然麻痹大意，忽视了轻灾区的工作。其次是对情况掌握不实，原本是重灾区，却被认为是轻灾区。部分地区去年水灾虽然不重，但后来又发生了旱灾，总起来说，灾情并不算轻，领导上却对此估计不足，没有按重灾区去安排工作，造成了工作的被动。再次少数轻灾区的各项工作又未能统筹安排，兴修水利、积肥和副业生产结合得不好。另外，有少数干部缺乏对灾农高度负责的精神，这也是忽视轻灾区工作的一个重要原因。
    这种忽视轻灾区的现象，在目前生产大跃进的形势下，是不应当有的。有关地区的党政领导，应当引起足够的重视，克服麻痹思想，全面安排灾区的工作，采取有效措施，很快使轻灾区的工作赶上去。应当组织力量，深入基层逐社逐户的进行检查。查生产运动，查统销，查救济，查疾病，查保畜，查盲目外流……等等，检查主要在于发现原因，研究改进的办法，对已发现的问题应当立即采取有效的办法予以解决。如果没有干部来主管救灾工作，应马上指定专人负责这一工作；在抓紧春耕生产的同时，也要适当开展副业生产。如果粮食供应和救济工作没有做好应当抓紧安排。只有这样，当前轻灾区的落后状态才能迅速扭转，生产大跃进的局面也才能在所有灾区普遍形成。
    重视轻灾区，当然不能忽视重灾区。特别是重灾区的部分落后乡社，其情况也同前述部分轻灾区的情况差不多，深值各地注意。目前正当春荒季节，是灾民困难最多的时候，不论轻、重灾区都应提高警惕，密切注意荒情的发展变化，做好救灾工作，以便彻底地战胜春荒。在全国农村生产大跃进的浪潮鼓舞下，灾区干部、群众的热情和干劲是不可估量的，只要领导方面自始至终地抓紧这个工作，任何困难都是可以征服的。
