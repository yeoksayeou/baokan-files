    Underground Wonders

    Imagine sailing in a flat-bottomed boat along a narrow underground river, gradually entering a pitch-black cave. But don't be afraid; bravely move forward. In an instant, a mythical world unfolds before your eyes. It's like a crystal palace, with "white jade" pillars rising from the ground and luxurious "white pearl" curtains hanging from above. Magnificent archways frame rows of thrones. Take a closer look, and you'll discover bizarre and fantastical reliefs covering the walls and ceilings. Where is this place? Which master artist designed this magical palace?

    This is actually the natural cave system in the "Moravsky Kras" region north of Brno, Czechoslovakia. The strata in this area are composed of limestone, covered with farmland, rolling hills, and dense forests. At first glance, it doesn't seem special. However, hidden beneath the surface and within the limestone cliffs are moving wonders. Especially in the northern part of this region, where the ground is not covered by forests, years of rain erosion have created many canyons and deep sinkholes. Rainwater seeps into the ground through cracks in the bottom of the holes, and rivers and streams disappear from the surface, flowing into caves and underground, forming underground rivers. Over time, due to the erosion of limestone by water, many interconnected caves have appeared underground. Torrents and rainwater seep drop by drop into the underground caves, each drop containing a large amount of limestone. Eventually, these drops turn into stalactites, shaped like icicles, hanging from the ceilings of the limestone caves, and stalagmites rising from the cave floor. Visitors here would never imagine that the designer of the underground "crystal palace" is not a person, but water!

    Among these underground caves is an open-air cave, 138 meters deep, the deepest in Central Europe, called "Macoch Cave" (stepmother abyss). According to legend, a man lived nearby who remarried after his wife died. His new wife was very cruel and abused his son from his previous marriage every day. One day, she threw him into a ravine. When the husband found out, he was extremely angry and threw her into the ravine as well. However, the child was caught by tree branches and rescued by others. From then on, people called the cave "Macoch Cave". At the bottom of "Macoch Cave" are two small lakes, very deep, in some places reaching tens of meters.

    The underground limestone caves of the "Moravsky Kras" area are even more attractive to archaeologists. It is said that people lived in these caves in ancient times, seeking refuge from the harsh climate of the Ice Age. However, these "residences" were not peaceful: not only did water dripping from the cave ceiling disturb people's dreams, but they also had to constantly fight against wild animals such as bears and lions in the caves. Later, when people explored these caves, they unearthed the bones of some wild animals, which made the underground caves even more famous.

    The first written record of these strange caves dates back to 1748. It wasn't until 1909 that scientists found part of the path to "Macoch Cave". It was only in 1932 that people could enter the underground caves. Because the underground water is very deep, scientists needed the help of divers to conduct their investigations. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, with the strong support of the government, scientists made greater progress in exploring the underground caves. Needless to say, more and more tourists are visiting. (Fang) (with picture)

    地下奇观
    你乘一只平底小木船顺着一条狭窄的地下小河划行，划着划着就划进一片漆黑的山洞。但是你不要害怕，要勇敢前进。刹那间，在你的眼前就展现出一个神话世界。这里宛如一座水晶宫，地面上耸立着“白玉”柱，顶上垂下豪华的“白珠”帘，壮丽的拱门衬托着排排的宝座。你再仔细看看，还会发现墙壁和天花板上布满了离奇古怪的浮雕。这里是什么地方？是哪一位美术大师设计的这个神奇的宫殿？
    原来这是捷克斯洛伐克共和国布尔诺市以北的“莫拉夫斯基·克拉斯”地区的天然石洞。这一带的地层是石灰岩构成的，地面上覆盖着耕地，岗陵起伏，树木丛生，一眼望去并看不出什么特殊的地方。但是在它的地下和那石灰岩的峭壁之中却隐藏着动人的奇迹。特别是在这个地区的北部，由于地面上没有树林覆盖，雨水经年的冲刷就形成了很多峡谷和深穴。雨水从穴底的裂缝渗入地下，河流和溪水在这里也从地面上消失流到山洞和地下去，形成了地下河。日久天长，由于水对石灰岩的浸蚀，在地下就出现了很多相连的石洞。山洪和雨水一滴滴地渗到地下洞里，这每一滴水里都含有大量的石灰石，久而久之就变成了悬在石灰洞上形如冰柱的钟乳石和矗立在洞底的石笋。到这里来游览的人，谁能想到地下“水晶宫”的设计大师不是人，而竟是水呢！
    在这些地下奇洞之间还有一个露天的大洞，这个洞深达一百三十八公尺，是中欧最深的洞，它的名字叫“后娘洞”。据传说，从前这附近住着一个人，妻子去世后又续娶了一位。他这个后妻非常凶恶，整天虐打前妻留下的儿子，有一天竟把他扔到山涧里去了。丈夫知道后愤恨已极，也把她扔下山涧。不过，小孩被树枝托住，被别人救上来了。从此以后，人们就把这个洞叫作“后娘洞”。在“后娘洞”底还有两个小湖，湖水很深，有的地方深达数十公尺。
    “莫拉夫斯基·克拉斯”区的地下石灰石洞对于考古学家来说更富有吸引力。据说，古代这些洞里住过人。是为了躲避冰河时代的恶劣气候，人们才藏到这里的。但是，这些“住宅”却不能使人平静：不仅洞顶上滴下来的水打扰人们的美梦，还要时常同洞中的狗熊、狮子等猛兽搏斗。后来当人们考察这些洞的时候，曾挖掘出一些野兽的骨骼，这就使地下洞更加出名了。
    关于这里的奇洞异穴在1748年就有了第一个文字考察材料。1909年科学家们才找到了到达“后娘洞”的部分道路。直到1932年才能进到地下洞去。因为地下水很深，所以科学家们进行考察时必需有潜水手的帮助。捷克斯洛伐克解放后，科学家们在政府的大力支持下，对地下洞的考察有了更大的进展。不用说，游人也越来越多了。（方）（附图片）
