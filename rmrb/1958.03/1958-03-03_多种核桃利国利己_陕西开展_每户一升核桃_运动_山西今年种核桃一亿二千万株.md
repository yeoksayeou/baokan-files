Planting More Walnuts Benefits the Country and the People
Shaanxi Launches "One Sheng of Walnuts per Household" Campaign
Shanxi to Plant 120 Million Walnut Trees This Year

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The movement to plant "one sheng of walnuts per household" is unfolding throughout Shaanxi Province.

The Shangluo Special District, which first launched the campaign to plant one sheng of walnuts per household, has already exceeded its planting target in less than half a year. After planting one sheng of walnuts per household, Shang County in this special district then launched a campaign to plant one hundred "money trees" per household. Nanzheng County, which has overfulfilled its target of planting ten "money trees" per person, recently put forward the requirement of planting one hundred "money trees" per household, ensuring early and over-fulfillment of the task.

(Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan) Shanxi Province has decided to overfulfill the ten-year development plan for walnuts in one year.

The walnut development plan formulated by Shanxi Province in 1956 called for the development of over 120 million walnut trees by 1967. In early February this year, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of prefectural and county party secretaries to study this plan again, believing that the plan was too conservative and would inevitably prolong the planting and benefit time. The meeting pointed out that all parts of Shanxi already have the conditions to develop walnut trees as soon as possible. Eighty percent of the counties already have walnut trees, and farmers already have planting experience. The existing 3 million walnut trees have a maximum annual output of 32 million jin, and 80% of the varieties are good varieties with thin skins, plump meat, and high kernel yield. As long as we grit our teeth and insist on not eating or transporting walnuts for one year, walnut seeds can meet the needs. In addition, various places have many traditional techniques for planting walnuts, and in recent years, farmers in the Taihang Mountains have also created the experience of overwintering seedlings and promoting early fruit bearing of walnut trees. Therefore, after criticizing conservative thinking, the meeting decided to mobilize the people of the province to work hard for one year this year to ensure that 130 million walnut trees are planted alive throughout the province in one year.

    多种核桃利国利己
    陕西开展“每户一升核桃”运动
    山西今年种核桃一亿二千万株
    据新华社讯　“每户种一升核桃”的运动正在陕西全省范围内展开。
    最先开展每户种一升核桃运动的商雒专区，在不到半年的时间内已经超额完成种植任务。这个专区的商县每户种了一升核桃之后，接着又展开了每户种植百棵“摇钱树”的运动。超额完成每人种十棵“摇钱树”的南郑县，最近又提出每户种一百棵“摇钱树”的要求，保证提前超额完成。
    据新华社太原电　山西省决定以一年时间超额完成十年发展核桃的规划指标。
    山西省1956年制订的核桃发展规划，要求到1967年发展一亿二千多万株核桃树。今年2月初，中共山西省委召开的地、县委书记会议再次研究了这个规划，认为这个规划四平八稳，势必拖长了种植和收益时间。会议指出，山西各地都已经具备了尽快发展核桃树的条件。现在80％的县都有了核桃树，农民已经有了种植经验。现有的三百多万株核桃树最高年产量达到三千二百万斤，而且80％的品种是皮薄、肉肥、出仁多的好品种。只要咬紧牙关，坚持一年不吃、不外运，核桃种籽就可以满足需要。另外，各地都有许多种植核桃的传统技术，最近几年来太行山区农民还创造了幼苗越冬、促使核桃树早结实的经验。因此，会议在批判了保守思想之后，决定在今年发动全省人民苦干一年，保证全省一年种活一亿三千万株核桃树。
