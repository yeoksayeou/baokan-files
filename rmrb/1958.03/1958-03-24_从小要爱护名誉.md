    "Cherish Reputation from Childhood" is one of the most popular works by Soviet writer Birventsev. This novel is dedicated to the Soviet Komsomol members and the heroic Soviet youth. It describes the lives and struggles of some young people in a village in Kuban during the period of agricultural collectivization and the Great Patriotic War. In the agricultural collectivization movement in the early 1930s, these young people were only ten years old, but in the fierce class struggle, they unconsciously participated in the struggle against the sabotage and assassination by rich peasants. When the Great Patriotic War broke out, they all responded to the call of the motherland and joined the anti-fascist war, some on the front lines, some as guerrillas, and some doing underground work. The tempering of the war made them grow strong.

    “从小要爱护名誉”
    “从小要爱护名誉”是苏联作家毕尔文采夫最受读者欢迎的作品之一。这个长篇小说是献给苏联共青团员和英勇的苏联青年的。它描写是库班一个村子中一些青年在农业集体化时期和卫国战争中的生活和斗争。在三十年代初的农业集体化运动中，这些青年还是些十来岁的小孩子，但在激烈的阶级斗争中，他们也不知不觉地参加了反对富农破坏和暗害的斗争。到卫国战争爆发，他们就都响应祖国的号召，投入反法西斯战争，有的在前线，有的打游击，有的做地下工作，战火的锻炼使他们坚强地成长起来。
