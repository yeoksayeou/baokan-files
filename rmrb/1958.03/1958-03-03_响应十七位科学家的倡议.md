    Responding to the Initiative of Seventeen Scientists
    We enthusiastically respond to the initiative put forward by the seventeen scientists in Shanghai published in the People's Daily on February 25th, and are determined to become leftists, striving to become scientific workers who are both red and expert, and even more red and more expert within five years.
    We will definitely formulate a self-transformation plan within February, striving to achieve the goal of being both red and expert as soon as possible; and we suggest that scientists across the country act together to give their hearts to the Party and their knowledge to the people, learn the revolutionary drive of workers and peasants, and strive to realize the country's scientific plan ahead of schedule.

    响应十七位科学家的倡议
    我们热烈响应2月25日人民日报登载的上海十七位科学家提出的倡议，下决心做左派，争取在五年内成为又红又专更红更专的科学工作者。
    我们一定在2月份内订出自我改造计划，争取早日达到又红又专的目标；并建议全国科学家一致行动起来，把心交给党、把知识交给人民，学习工人农民的革命干劲，力争提前实现国家的科学规划。
