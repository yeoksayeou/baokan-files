Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Special Dispatch: The person in charge of Yulin Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, told Xinhua reporters: The achievements of the people in the Yulin area in fighting the desert prove that in desert areas, as long as there are people, water, and fertilizer, any tall sand dune can be turned into fertile land.

Over the past eight years, the people of the Yulin area have waged a tenacious and unyielding struggle against wind and sand, and the local natural landscape has begun to change. Most of the more than 1.5 million mu of sand prevention forest belts built here have grown into lush forests, including 35 large dense forests of more than 5,000 mu each, which are connected intermittently into belts. The growth of these sand prevention forests has gradually turned many exposed sand dunes into oases. Farmers have transformed many undulating beaches into flat paddy fields, with fields and paths crisscrossing and sparkling water, which in summer becomes a green expanse, turning the area into a "Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall."

Farmers in Heihaizi and Guchengtan in Yulin County, Leilongwan in Hengshan County, Yangqiaopan in Jingbian County, and other places, dug canals to divert water to the top of large sand dunes in undulating shifting sand dunes, using water power to scour downwards, gradually collapsing and leveling the two- or three-zhang-high sand dunes, turning them into flat, moist arable land. Farmers also diverted muddy water containing soil to flood the sand layer, turning sand particles into loam. Now, the farmers in Guchengtan, Yulin County, have turned more than 2,000 mu of barren sandy land into paddy fields, with an average yield of more than 400 jin of rice per mu, and a maximum of 800 jin. This is eight to nine times higher than the yield of local dry sandy land. The more than 2,500 mu of dry sandy land cultivated in Leilongwan, Hengshan County, has an average yield of 168 jin of wheat per mu, which is three to nine times higher than the average yield of the county. The newly cultivated more than 8,000 mu of land in Yangqiaopan, Jingbian County, produced more than 200 jin of wheat per mu last year, making the local agricultural cooperative transform from a grain-deficient cooperative to a grain-surplus cooperative, basically freeing itself from poverty.

In the sandy areas near the hilly gully area of Jingbian and Dingbian, farmers have dug and built hundreds of flood discharge canal systems on many hillsides and gully mouths according to the local rainfall season's flood volume. Whenever mountain torrents break out, the masses upstream and downstream of the canal divert the flood downwards and inundate the land with mud in a planned manner, gradually covering more than 200,000 mu of sand beaches into fertile fields. Although these inundated lands are not fertilized, the yield per mu is still more than twice as high as that of ordinary dry land in the area.

In large sand dune areas without rivers or mountain floods, such as Dabaodang in Shenmu County, Shajingzi in Jingbian County, and Hailiutan in Yulin County, farmers have studied the local prevailing wind direction. At the lower part of the windward slope of the sand dunes, they built barriers and planted Artemisia wudanica to gradually fix the shifting sand under the receding sand bank; at the same time, they planted Hedysarum scoparium and Salix psammophila on the leeward slope of the sand dunes to prevent the sand dunes from moving. In this way, they "block in front and pull behind," using wind power to gradually level the sand dunes, preventing and slowing down the speed of shifting sand. According to typical surveys: in the same area, sand dunes in unforested areas move an average of 15 to 20 chi per year, while sand dunes in forested areas move an average of 5 to 10 chi per year. The height of the sand dunes also decreases by an average of 1.5 to 3 chi per year. At present, more than 40 sand dunes have been fixed and leveled in various places, covering an area of more than 220,000 mu.

Yulin Prefecture is a sandy area along the Great Wall, covering a total area of about 22.6 million mu. These deserts are mainly distributed in the northern half of the six counties of Shenmu, Fugu, Yulin, Hengshan, Jingbian, and Dingbian, accounting for 52% of the prefecture's land area. Among them, there are more than 8.62 million mu of shifting sand dunes. Every spring, strong winds cover the sky, rolling sand southward. Historically, countless villages, rivers, farmlands, and pastures have been buried. According to local chronicles, since the Ming Dynasty, the county seat of Yulin has moved south three times due to wind and sand.

    自由的人自由支配自然
    榆林专区往日风沙逐人如今阡陌纵横
    本报特约新华社西安专讯  陕西省榆林专区负责人对新华社记者说：榆林地区人民和沙漠斗争的成就证明，在沙漠地区，只要有人、有水、有肥料，任何高大的沙丘都可以变为良田。
    八年来，榆林地区的人民和风沙进行了顽强不屈的斗争，当地的自然面貌已开始发生变化。这里营造的一百五十多万亩防沙林带大部分已葱郁成林，其中三十五块五千亩以上的大片密林，断断续续接连成带。这些防沙林的成长，使许多裸露的沙丘，逐渐变成绿洲。农民们把许多起伏不平的沙滩，修成平整的稻田，阡陌纵横，水光闪闪，每到夏天，田垅里一片嫩绿，成了“塞上江南”。
    榆林县黑海子、古城滩，横山县雷龙湾，靖边县杨桥畔等地农民，在一片起伏不平的流动沙丘中，挖渠引水到大沙丘顶上，利用水力向下冲刷，逐渐把两、三丈高的沙丘冲塌拉平，变成平坦湿润的可耕地。农民们还引灌带有泥土的浑水，漫淤沙层，变沙粒为壤土。现在，榆林县古城滩的农民已把两千多亩荒沙地变成稻田，每亩平均产稻四百多斤，最高达到八百斤。比当地旱沙地产量高出八、九倍。横山县雷龙湾一带修成的两千五百多亩旱沙地，平均亩产小麦一百六十八斤，比全县平均产量高出三倍到九倍。靖边县杨桥畔新修的八千多亩土地，去年每亩产小麦二百多斤，使当地农业社由缺粮社一跃而为余粮社，基本上摆脱了贫困。
    靖边、定边靠近丘陵沟壑区的风沙地带，农民们根据当地雨季的洪水量，在许多山坡沟口挖修了几百条排洪渠系。每当山洪暴发，渠道上下游的群众就引洪下泄，有计划地分片漫地淤泥，把二十多万亩沙滩，逐渐漫成了肥沃良田，这些经过漫淤的土地，虽不施肥，每亩产量仍比当地一般旱地高出一倍以上。
    在没有河流、山洪的大沙丘地区如神木县大保当、靖边县沙井子和榆林县海流滩等地，农民们研究了当地的主风方向，在沙丘迎风坡的下部，搭障蔽、种沙蒿，使退沙畔下的流沙逐渐固定；同时，在沙丘背风坡面种沙芥，栽沙柳，阻止沙丘流动，这样“前挡后拉”，利用风力把沙丘逐渐拉平，阻止和延缓了流沙移动速度。根据典型调查：在同一地区，无林区的沙丘每年平均前进十五至二十尺，而林地里的沙丘每年平均前进五尺至十尺。沙丘的高度每年也平均降低一尺半至三尺。目前各地已固定和拉平的沙丘有四十多处，面积达二十二万多亩。
    榆林专区是长城沿线的风沙区，面积共约两千二百多万亩。这些沙漠主要分布在神木、府谷、榆林、横山、靖边、定边六县的北半部，占全专区土地面积52％。其中有八百六十二万多亩流动沙丘，每年春天，狂风遮天，卷沙南移，历史上曾埋没的村镇、河流、农田和牧场不计其数。据地方志记载：自明代以来，榆林县城因风沙逼迫曾南迁三次。
