Xinhua News Agency, 10th: More than 900 design personnel from the Beijing Design Institute held a rally on March 10th to pledge their commitment to a Great Leap Forward in design work, proposing a socialist Great Leap Forward among national design workers in "improving design quality and opposing design waste." The action slogans they put forward were: "Everyone plans, strive for the top; transform ourselves, help each other; step-by-step towards the left, become red and thoroughly proficient.” At the rally, many designers expressed their willingness to humbly learn from the advanced experiences of other design units, learn from each other's strengths to offset their weaknesses, and improve together, and are willing to advance side by side with design workers across the country.

The five leap forward indicators unanimously adopted by the design staff are:

	I. Politically, firmly be a leftist, dedicate our hearts to the Party, resolutely accept the Party's leadership, and resolutely implement the Party's guidelines and policies in urban construction and architectural design.

	II. Establish socialist design thinking, break bourgeois design thinking, and resolutely correct the fame and profit-seeking mentality of building "monuments" for individuals. Check our own thinking and work once every quarter, conduct criticism and self-criticism frequently, consciously strengthen self-ideological transformation, continuously improve ourselves, strive for organizational help, mass supervision, work hard for five years, and strive to become proletarian intellectuals who are both red and expert, and even redder and more expert, ahead of schedule.

	III. Resolutely implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In 1958, achieve the following indicators: More, exceed the national currency workload quota by 30%; Faster, the progress of drawing production guarantees construction, complete all drawings at once, and strive to complete ahead of schedule; Better, improve the quality of design and drafting, eliminate design errors, and the average number of errors per standard sheet should not exceed 0.5; More economical, practice strict economy, reduce costs, and save 20% according to the national building investment standards for 1958.

	IV. Strengthen the mass viewpoint, always consider the needs of users and builders, conduct more investigations and research, go to construction sites more often, closely connect with the workers, so that the drawings we design are combined with reality, and truly achieve applicability, economy, and, when possible, pay attention to aesthetics.

	V. Develop technical democracy, give full play to technical expertise, create collectively, and make the best use of everyone's talents. The eight chief engineers in the institute, with the cooperation of all the design staff, will each preside over a business-specific research project and make significant achievements in three to five years.

    北京设计院提出大跃进倡议
    做个红透专深的设计师
    据新华社10日讯　北京市设计院九百多个设计人员10日举行设计工作大跃进的誓师大会，倡议全国设计工作者在“提高设计质量，反对设计浪费”方面来一个社会主义大跃进。他们提出的行动口号是：“人人规划，力争上游；自我改造，互相帮助；步步左转，红透专深。”在誓师大会上，许多设计人员都提出要虚心学习其他设计单位的先进经验，取长补短，共同提高，并愿和全国设计工作者并肩前进。
    设计工作人员一致通过的五项跃进指标是：
    一、在政治上坚定地做左派，把心交给党，坚决接受党的领导，坚决执行党在城市建设和建筑设计方面的方针政策。
    二、立社会主义设计思想，破资产阶级设计思想，坚决纠正为个人建“纪念碑”的名利思想。每季度检查一次自己的思想和工作，经常进行批评和自我批评，自觉地加强自我思想改造，不断提高自己，争取组织帮助，群众监督，苦战五年，力争提前成为又红又专、更红更专的工人阶级知识分子。
    三、坚决贯彻多、快、好、省的勤俭建国方针。在1958年达到下列指标：多，按国家货币工作量定额超过30％；快，出图进度保证施工，一次出齐，并争取提前； 好，提高设计和制图质量，消灭设计错误，图面差错平均每标准张不超过零点五个；省，厉行节约，降低造价，按国家规定的1958年建筑投资标准，节约20％。
    四、加强群众观点，处处为使用者和施工者着想，多做调查研究，多到工地，密切联系工人群众，使自己设计出的图纸与实际相结合，真正做到适用、经济和可能条件下注意美观。
    五、发展技术民主，发挥技术专长，集体创作，各尽其能。院内的八个总工程师在全院设计人员的配合下，分别主持一项业务专题研究，在三年至五年内，作出显著的成绩。
