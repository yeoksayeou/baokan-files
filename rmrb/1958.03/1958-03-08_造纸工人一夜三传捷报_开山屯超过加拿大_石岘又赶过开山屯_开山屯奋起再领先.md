Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th March: The state-owned Kaishantun Paper Mill created a new record on the 3rd by steaming a batch of unbleached wood pulp in five hours and fifteen minutes. This record is fifteen minutes faster than the world's advanced Canadian level of five hours and thirty minutes. The director of the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry sent a telegram on the 4th to congratulate the factory's employees.

　　The Kaishantun Paper Mill was originally a backward unit in terms of pulp steaming. In the upsurge of catching up with advanced production competitions, all the factory employees were determined to change this situation. They proposed that the steaming time for unbleached wood pulp should be shortened from seven hours and twenty minutes in the fourth quarter of last year to six hours this year, and bleached wood pulp should be shortened from seven hours and forty minutes to six hours and thirty minutes. On February 28, the employees made two major technical improvements. The steaming time for a batch of bleached pulp first broke through the plan and was shortened to five hours and fifty-four minutes, creating a new record since the factory was built. Then, on the 3rd, the steaming workshop created new records for steaming unbleached wood pulp twice in a row, first shortening it to five hours and twenty-eight minutes, and then to five hours and fifteen minutes.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th March: The new record of five hours and fifteen minutes for steaming a batch of pulp (unbleached wood pulp) created by the Kaishantun Paper Mill on the 3rd was broken by the Shixian Paper Mill on the 4th after only one day. The steaming workers of the Shixian Paper Mill used only four hours and fifty-one minutes on this day to cook a batch of pulp.

　　The competition between these two brother factories near the Tumen River to compare with the advanced and catch up with the advanced has attracted a lot of attention. The Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Soviet experts from the Paper Design Institute have all sent telegrams to congratulate the Shixian Paper Mill on this new achievement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th March: The Kaishantun Paper Mill, which was the first to reach the world's advanced level in pulp steaming, steamed a batch of unbleached wood pulp in four hours and ten minutes on the evening of the 6th, surpassing the record of four hours and fifty-one minutes created by the Shixian Paper Mill on the 4th, and once again took the lead.

　　The mutual comparison of advanced technologies, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced reached a climax with the continuous emergence of new records at the Kaishantun and Shixian factories. Although the two factories are far apart, they exchange information every day. The Shixian factory announced the new record on the 4th to the Kaishantun factory on the same day. The Kaishantun factory sent engineers, the head of the technical section, foremen, and workers to the Shixian factory at 10 pm that night to learn from their experience. After returning to the factory the next day, they led all the employees to make full preparations. On the third day (6th), the employees made improvements in the operation of the main links in the pulp steaming process, so they successively created new records of four hours and twenty-nine minutes, twenty-seven minutes, twenty-one minutes, and ten minutes for steaming time.

    造纸工人一夜三传捷报
    开山屯超过加拿大
    石岘又赶过开山屯
    开山屯奋起再领先
    据新华社长春7日电　国营开山屯造纸厂在3日创造了以五时十五分的时间蒸煮出一锅本色木浆的新纪录。这一纪录比世界先进的加拿大水平五时三十分还缩短了十五分钟。轻工业部造纸局局长为此在4日打电报向这个厂职工祝贺。
    开山屯造纸厂在纸浆蒸煮方面原是一个落后单位，在赶先进的生产竞赛热潮中，全厂职工决心改变这种情况，他们提出本色木浆蒸煮时间今年要由去年第四季度的七时二十分缩短到六时，漂白木浆由七时四十分缩短到六时三十分。2月28日，职工们在技术上作了两项重大改进，一锅漂白浆蒸煮时间首先突破计划，缩短到五时五十四分，创造了建厂以来的新纪录。接着，蒸煮工段又在3日一连两次创造本色木浆蒸煮时间新纪录，第一次缩短到五时二十八分，第二次又缩短到五时十五分。
    据新华社长春7日电　开山屯造纸厂3日创造的五时十五分蒸煮一锅纸浆（本色木浆）的新纪录，刚刚保持了一天就在4日被石岘造纸厂突破了。石岘造纸厂蒸煮职工，在这一天里只用了四时五十一分就煮好了一锅纸浆。
    这两个临近图们江的兄弟工厂展开的比先进、赶先进的竞赛，引起了人们很大的注意。轻工业部造纸局、吉林省工会联合会和造纸设计院的苏联专家等，都分别打电报祝贺石岘造纸厂的这一新成就。
    据新华社长春7日电　在纸浆蒸煮方面最先达到世界先进水平的开山屯造纸厂，6日晚上又以四时十分蒸煮了一锅本色木浆，赶过了石岘造纸厂4日创造的四时五十一分的纪录，再次领先。
    开山屯，石岘两厂在新纪录连续出现中相互比先进，学先进，赶先进达到了高潮。两厂虽然相距很远，但是天天互通情报。石岘厂4日出现了新纪录，当天就通知开山屯厂，开山屯厂派工程师、技术科长、工长、工人在当晚十时赶到石岘厂学习经验。他们第二天回厂后，率领全厂职工作了全面准备。第三天（6日），职工们在蒸煮纸浆主要环节的操作上都作了改进，因此连续创造了蒸煮时间四时二十九、二十七、二十一、十分的新纪录。
