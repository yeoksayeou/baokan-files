Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 8th: The Jinan Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry recently held a conference on streamlining labor organization for 1958, and formulated a great leap forward plan to reduce personnel, improve efficiency, and increase raw coal production. According to this plan, the bureau will reduce more than 10,000 auxiliary workers and non-production personnel this year; and raw coal production will increase by 2.08 million tons on top of the state plan, an increase of 34.2% compared with last year's actual production.

At the meeting, in the spirit of the "Double-Anti" movement and the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," the leadership cadres of various bureaus (mines) eliminated their right-leaning conservative thinking that "increasing production requires increasing manpower, and it is difficult to increase production without increasing manpower" by thorough investigation and careful calculation.

A person in charge of the Jinan Bureau said at the meeting that doing so could achieve five goals with one arrow: solving the problem of needing to increase people in mining and tunneling during the great leap forward in production (some can be filled by auxiliary workers); plugging loopholes in waste (it is estimated that wages alone can save 5 million yuan); reversing the situation of lower efficiency than other regions and catching up with the advanced; supporting new mines (the bureau can recruit half as many people); and overcoming the chaotic phenomena in labor production management.

    整顿劳动组织一箭五雕
    济南煤管局人员减少一万　产量增加三分之一
    据新华社济南8日电　煤炭工业部济南管理局最近召开1958年整顿劳动组织会议，制定了一个减少人员、提高效率、增产原煤的大跃进计划。按照这个计划，今年全局将减少辅助工、非生产人员等一万多人；而原煤产量将在国家计划基础上增产二百零八万吨，比去年实际产量提高34.2％。
    会上根据双反运动的精神和多快好省的方针，通过摊底子、算细账，消除了各局（矿）领导干部的那种“要增产就得增人，不增人难以增产”的右倾保守思想。
    济南管理局的一位负责人在会上说，这样做可以一箭五雕：解决了生产大跃进中在采掘工方面需要增加人的问题（可由辅助工去充实一部分）；堵塞浪费漏洞（仅工资开支一项，据初步计算，即能节省五百万元）；扭转效率低于其他地区的局面，从落后赶上先进；支援新矿井（全局可少招收一半人员）；克服劳动生产管理上的混乱现象。
