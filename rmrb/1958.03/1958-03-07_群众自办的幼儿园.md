    Kindergartens Run by the Masses
    The Tianhai Road Kindergarten in Nankai District, Tianjin, was established by the masses, adhering to the spirit of diligence and thrift in running undertakings. In addition to managing all 94 children, the 14 staff members of the kindergarten also use their spare time to make toys for the children. Their fees are generally lower than other kindergartens in Tianjin, but the children can eat a variety of nutritious foods every day.
    This kindergarten was founded in 1955. The furniture and houses used at the beginning were donated or lent by nearby residents. Carpenters and painters in the neighborhood also voluntarily made small beds and painted doors and windows for the kindergarten.

    群众自办的幼儿园
    天津市南开区天海路幼儿园是由群众自办并本着勤俭办事业的精神建立起来的。该园十四个工作人员除了管理全部九十四个孩子的工作以外，还利用业余时间给孩子们制作玩具。他们的收费标准一般要低于天津市其它的幼儿园，但是孩子们每天都能吃到各种富有营养的食品。
    这个幼儿园是1955年成立的，开办时的家具和房屋等都由附近的群众捐赠或借给。邻居的木工、油工也义务给幼儿园制作小床和油漆门窗。
