Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 25th: The workers and staff of the Korean electric power industry department are determined to fully restore all the power stations that were severely damaged during the war in this year—the fifth year after the Korean Armistice. They also aim to increase power production by 700 million kilowatt-hours beyond the state plan for this year, thus increasing the total power generation of Korean power stations this year by 1.85 billion kilowatt-hours, greatly exceeding the pre-war level of 1949. This leap-forward increase in production target of the Korean electric power industry workers and staff was proposed at the recent conference of activists of the Korean Ministry of Electricity.

Currently, the workers and staff of various power stations in Korea are undertaking the restoration of ten hydroelectric generators with a high degree of revolutionary zeal, including generators at the Changjin River and Pujon River power stations. Among these generators being repaired, some will be completed before the second quarter and will begin supplying electricity.

During the Korean War, the U.S. Air Force concentrated its bombing on Korean power stations, resulting in the destruction of 70% of Korea's electric power industrial equipment. As soon as the war stopped, the workers and staff of various power stations in Korea began restoration work. After more than four years of hard work, by the end of last year, sixteen power stations, thousands of kilometers of transmission lines, and many large substations had been restored, enabling Korea's power equipment to recover to 96% of the pre-war level of 1949. What is particularly important is that the workers and staff of various power stations in Korea, with the assistance of fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, innovated the original technical equipment while restoring it. Last year they also raised the dams of many hydroelectric power stations, increasing the water storage capacity of the reservoirs. As a result, although Korea's power generation equipment had not yet recovered to the 1949 level last year, it produced 6.9 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, an increase of 15.4% over 1949.

At present, Korea's electric power industry is not only able to fully supply the electricity needs of various rapidly developing industrial sectors, but also built many new power grids in rural areas after the war, providing approximately 110,000 horsepower of irrigation power to the countryside, which is more than five times the pre-war level. In addition, the electricity grids for lighting in cities and villages have also increased by 23% compared to 1949. Even the vast rural areas and remote mountainous areas are brightly lit.

Korea has many steep mountains, rapid rivers, and a large drop in river water levels, making its hydropower resources very rich. According to preliminary surveys, there are 500 rivers in Korea that can be used for hydropower generation. Among the sixty-four important rivers, hydroelectric power stations with a generating capacity of 8 million kilowatts can be built, and 1.8 million kilowatts have already been developed. Korea aims to achieve a power generation of 9.7 billion kilowatt-hours within the first five-year plan that began last year. During this period, on the one hand, the existing power stations will be restored and reorganized, and on the other hand, hydropower resources will continue to be developed. The new construction project of the Turujiang Hydroelectric Power Station with a generating capacity of 90,000 kilowatts, which was started after the war, will be completed. The dam is currently under construction. In addition, a thermal power plant with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts will be restored and built during this period.

While the electric power industry in northern Korea is rapidly recovering and developing, the electric power industry in South Korea is in poor condition. According to materials released by the South Korean authorities, the electricity produced by South Korea in 1956 was only one-fifth of the electricity produced by northern Korea in the same year. According to reports from the South Korean News Agency, South Korea produced a total of 115 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in February this year, which is less than one-third of the electricity needed by South Korea's metallurgical and chemical industries.

### 把电站全部恢复　增产十八亿度电  朝鲜电力工业大步跃进  今年发电量将超过战前1949年水平

    把电站全部恢复　增产十八亿度电
    朝鲜电力工业大步跃进
    今年发电量将超过战前1949年水平
    据新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜电力工业部门的职工们决心要在今年——朝鲜停战后的第五个年头，把在战时遭到严重破坏的各个发电站全部恢复起来，并且要在今年的国家计划以外，增产七亿瓩时的电力，从而使朝鲜发电站今年的总发电量比去年多十八亿五千万瓩时而大大超过战前1949年的水平。朝鲜电力工业部门职工的这个跃进式的增产目标，是在不久前举行的朝鲜电气省积极分子大会上提出来的。
    目前，朝鲜各发电站的职工们正以高度的革命干劲，着手进行十部水力发电机的恢复工程，其中有长津江、赴战江等发电站的发电机。在这些正在修复的发电机中，有的在第二季度以前就能够完工，开始供电。
    在朝鲜战争时期，美国空军曾经集中轰炸了朝鲜的发电站，使得朝鲜的70％的电力工业设备遭到破坏。战争一停止，朝鲜各发电站的职工就开始了恢复工作。经过四年多来的艰苦努力，到去年年底已经恢复了十六个发电站、数千公里长的送电线路和许多大型变电所，使朝鲜的发电设备恢复到战前1949年的96％。尤其重要的是朝鲜各发电站的职工们在苏联和捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家的援助下，一边恢复一边革新了原有的技术设备，并且在去年加高了许多水力发电站的水坝，增加了水库的贮水量。结果，朝鲜在去年发电设备虽然还没有恢复到1949年的水平，但是却生产了六十九亿瓩时的电力，比1949年还增加了15.4％。
    目前，朝鲜的电力工业不仅能够充分供应正在迅速发展着的各工业部门的电力需要，还在战后在农村新修了许多输电网，为农村提供着约十一万马力的灌溉动力，这等于战前的五倍多。另外，城市和乡村的照明用电网也比1949年增加了23％。连广大的农村和边远的山区都大放光明。
    朝鲜山多而陡峭，河流湍急，河水的落差很大，水力发电资源十分丰富。据初步勘察，朝鲜有五百条河流可以用来进行水力发电。其中重要的六十四条河流中就可修建发电能力八百万瓩的水力发电站，现在已经开发的有一百八十万瓩。朝鲜在从去年开始的第一个五年计划内，要使发电量达到九十七亿瓩时。在这期间，一方面要把原有的发电站恢复整顿起来，一方面要继续开发水力资源，并且完成战后兴建的有九万瓩发电能力的秃鲁江水力发电站的新建工程，这个工程现在正在修建水坝。另外，在这期间还要恢复和建设有十万瓩发电能力的火力发电厂。
    在朝鲜北部的电力工业迅速恢复和发展的同时，南朝鲜的电力工业情况却很不好。据南朝鲜当局发表的材料，1956年南朝鲜生产的电力只等于同一年朝鲜北部所生产的电力的五分之一。据南朝鲜通讯社报道，今年2月分南朝鲜一共生产了一亿一千五百多万瓩时电力，还不到南朝鲜的冶金、化学工业部门所需要的电力的三分之一。
