Xinhua News Agency, March 28th dispatch from Bonn: The Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, read a statement on behalf of the party's parliamentary group at a press conference on the 27th, demanding that the Adenauer government step down and a new government be formed. He said that the Social Democratic Party would support such a new government if this government was willing to abandon atomic armament and was willing to seriously begin negotiations on guaranteeing peace for all of Germany and easing tensions in Europe.

Ollenhauer called on the West German people to protest the Adenauer government's decision to drag West Germany into the atomic arms race. He said that using strikes as a means of protesting West German atomic armament is constitutional. In addition to strikes, other protest measures can be taken, such as holding referendums on the issue of atomic armament throughout West Germany or in several states, holding mass petitions, and launching the "Anti-Atomic Death" movement.

    西德社会民主党
    要阿登纳政府下台
    据新华社28日讯　波恩消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔27日代表该党议会党团在记者招待会上宣读一项声明，要求阿登纳政府下台，另外成立一个新政府。他说，社会民主党将支持这样的新政府，如果这个政府愿意放弃原子武装并且愿意认真开始进行有关保障全德和平和缓和欧洲紧张局势的谈判。
    奥伦豪尔号召西德人民抗议阿登纳政府把西德拖进原子军备竞赛的决定。他说，用罢工作为抗议西德原子武装的手段是合乎宪法的。除了罢工以外，还可以采取在西德全国或在若干州内就原子武装问题举行公民投票、举行群众请愿以及开展“反对原子死亡”运动等其他抗议措施。（附图片）
