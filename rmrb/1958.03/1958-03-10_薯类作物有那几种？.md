What Kinds of Tuber Crops Are There?

There are many kinds of tuber crops grown in our country, including sweet potatoes, potatoes, taro, cassava, and arrowroot.

Sweet potato, also known as white potato, red potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, and yam, is the most important tuber crop in our country. Its cultivation area accounts for more than three-quarters of the tuber crops, and its output accounts for about 80%. Except for Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other places, all provinces in the country grow it, mainly concentrated in the Yellow River and Huai River basins, the Sichuan Basin and the southeast coast (including Taiwan).

Potato, also known as yam, potato, ground egg, and yam egg, is a tuber crop that can be cultivated in all provinces of the country, but it is mostly planted in the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Sichuan, and in the suburbs of large cities. In 1956, the national potato planting area reached more than 31 million mu, accounting for about 18% of tuber crops. Potatoes have high yields, short growing periods, and long seasons for planting, and can be used as good double-cropping crops.

Taro, also known as taro, is a perennial herb. There are two types of taro: water taro and dry taro. They are cultivated in the south and the north, but mostly in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang and other provinces. Its tubers are rich in starch and delicate, and can be used as a staple food or as a vegetable, and can also be used as a raw material for manufacturing starch.

Cassava, also known as tree cassava, is a perennial woody plant that is cultivated in some subtropical regions of our country. Generally, each mu can harvest more than two or three thousand catties of fresh cassava. The tubers of cassava contain about 30% starch, which can be used as food, and can also be used in industry as raw materials for pharmaceuticals, papermaking, textiles, and leather making.

Arrowroot, also known as canna, belongs to the banana-like Canna family and is an annual herb, sparsely planted in Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangxi and other places. The tubers contain 15%-20% starch, which can be used to make starch, and can also be used to make cakes, fans, etc. The stems and leaves can be used to feed pigs, and can be planted in mountainous areas and newly reclaimed land. Generally, each mu can harvest more than three or four thousand catties.

Other tuber crops include yam bean (liangshu), yam (yam), and Jerusalem artichoke (yangjiang). They are planted in smaller areas and are generally used for vegetables, yam is used for medicine, and Jerusalem artichoke is used for feed and brewing.

    薯类作物有那几种？
    我国栽种的薯类作物很多，有甘薯、马铃薯、芋、木薯、蕉芋等。
    甘薯又叫白薯、红薯、红苕、地瓜、番薯、山芋。是我国最主要的一种薯类作物。它的栽培面积占薯类作物的四分之三多，产量占80％左右。全国除青海、内蒙古等地以外，各省都栽种，主要集中栽培区在黄河、淮河流域之间，四川盆地与东南沿海（包括台湾）等地。
    马铃薯又名洋芋、土豆、地蛋、山药蛋。马铃薯是一种块茎作物，在全国各省都可栽培，但以黑龙江、甘肃、四川三省和大城市郊区种植最多。1956年全国马铃薯种植面积达三千一百多万亩，约占薯类作物的18％。马铃薯的产量较高，生长期较短，能够栽种的季节也长，可以作为良好的复种作物。
    芋又称芋头、芋艿，是多年生草本植物。芋有水芋和旱芋两种，在南方和北方都有栽培，而以四川、江西、广东、浙江等省较多。它的块茎含淀粉多而细腻，可当主粮或作菜蔬之用，也可作制造淀粉的原料。
    木薯又名树薯，是一种多年生的木本植物，在我国亚热带的一些地区均有栽培。一般每亩可收鲜木薯二、三千斤以上。木薯的块根含有30％左右的淀粉，除可充作食用外，在工业上可供制药，造纸，纺织，制革等原料之用。
    蕉芋也称蕉藕、藕芋。属芭蕉类昙花科，是一年生的草本植物，在福建、浙江、广西等地有零星种植。块茎含淀粉量15％—20％，可制造淀粉，也能做糕饼、粉丝等之用。茎叶可喂猪，在山地、新垦地都能种植，一般每亩可收三、四千斤以上。
    薯类作物中还有豆薯（凉薯）薯蓣（山药）菊芋（洋姜）等，它们种植面积较少，一般多用于菜蔬，薯蓣用于医药，菊芋用于饲料和酿造。
