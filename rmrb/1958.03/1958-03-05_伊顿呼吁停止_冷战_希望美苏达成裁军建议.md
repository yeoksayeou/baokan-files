Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, March 3rd: American industrialist Cyrus Eaton, in a Canadian television program speech, called for an end to the "Cold War" and expressed hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would reach an arms reduction agreement.

Eaton said that the world's leading scientists unanimously believe that if a nuclear war were to break out, it would be a catastrophe for all mankind.

Eaton said that the Russians do not want war, nor do they intend to impose communism on the United States by force. On our part, our policy should be based on the fact that there are two major countries with national systems different from ours—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The people of these two countries have every right to live in their own way and experiment with the economic system they like. Eaton continued, history proves that this is a consolidated national system. He said that Dulles' biggest mistake was that he used the unrealizable hope that "the communist system will collapse" as the starting point of his foreign policy.

    伊顿呼吁停止“冷战”
    希望美苏达成裁军建议
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社渥太华3日讯：美国工业家赛勒斯·伊顿在加拿大电视节目中发表演说，号召停止“冷战”并希望美苏达成裁军协议。
    伊顿说，全世界著名的科学家都一致认为，如果核战争一旦爆发，对于全人类将是一个大灾难。
    伊顿说，俄国人不希望战争，也不打算用武力把共产主义强加于美国。在我们这方面，我们的政策应该以下列事实为出发点，即存在着国家制度与我们不同的两个大国——苏联和中华人民共和国。这两个国家的人民完全有权利按照自己的方式生活和试验他们喜欢的经济制度。伊顿继续说，历史证明这是一种巩固的国家制度。他说，杜勒斯最大的错误在于他用“共产主义制度会崩溃”这种无法实现的指望作为自己外交政策的出发点。
