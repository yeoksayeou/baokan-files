These measures include publishing the resolution of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference on disarmament and the elimination of the threat of atomic war in newspapers and magazines, launching a signature campaign among readers on petitions, which will then be collected by the Secretariat and handed over to the U.S. government, demanding that it stop nuclear weapons testing. In addition, telegrams will be sent to the United Nations and heads of state, requesting their intervention to halt nuclear weapons testing. Furthermore, radio broadcasts, exhibitions, films, and lectures in schools will be used to illustrate the serious consequences of the atomic bomb explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    新华社开罗27日电　亚非人民团结理事会常设秘书处今天公布了依照去年12月亚非人民团结大会的建议，在3月1日采取共同行动要求停止生产和试验核武器的七点办法。
    这些办法包括通过报刊公布亚非人民团结大会关于裁军和消除原子战争威胁的决议，在读者中间展开在呼吁书上签名的签名运动，然后由秘书处搜集交给美国政府，要求它停止核武器试验。另外还打电报给联合国和各国首脑，要求他们进行干预，来使核武器试验停止。此外，还要通过广播、展览会、电影和在各学校中举办的讲演，来说明原子弹在广岛和长崎爆炸的严重后果。
