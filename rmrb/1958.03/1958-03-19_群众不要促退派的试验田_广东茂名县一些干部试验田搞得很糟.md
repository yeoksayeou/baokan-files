The Masses Don't Want "Regressionist" Experimental Plots
Some Cadres in Maoming County, Guangdong, Are Doing a Terrible Job with Their Experimental Plots

(Our Dispatch from Guangzhou) In Maoming County, Guangdong Province, many cadres' experimental plots are not living up to their name. Their targets are conservative, and the masses are mocking them as "regressionist" experimental plots.

The Maoming County Party Committee originally requested that the first batch of cadre experimental plots in the county be sown by February 28th. However, some cadres were slow to act. As of the 4th of this month, only 30% of the planned area had been sown. The spring plowing season has already begun, but some cadres have not even selected a location for their experimental plots.

The production targets of some cadres' experimental plots are also quite conservative, lagging behind the masses. The County Party Committee originally requested that the rice experimental plots yield more than 1,500 catties of rice per mu, and the peanut experimental plots yield more than 500 catties per mu. However, according to statistics from Gongguan and Zhengang townships, among the 68 cadres planting rice experimental plots in the townships, 23 of them had yield targets below 1,000 catties per mu. The yield target for the experimental plot of Gu Zhili, the secretary of the Zhengang Township Party Committee, was also only 1,000 catties. Among the 48 cadres planting peanut experimental plots, 32 of them had yield targets below 500 catties per mu. In Tongxing Cooperative in Niutou Township, the yield of many rice paddies had already reached 1,000 catties per mu, but the yield target for the experimental plot of cooperative cadre Chen Yingwen was only 1,000 catties. The masses said that if they followed his example, they would only regress.

Some cadres' experimental plots only have empty production increase targets, without corresponding measures to achieve them. Some cadres are nominally planting experimental plots, but they have not actually gone to the fields. Currently, these situations have attracted the attention of the local leadership, and the leading organs are taking measures to correct them.

    群众不要促退派的试验田
    广东茂名县一些干部试验田搞得很糟
    本报广州讯　广东省茂名县不少干部的试验田名不副实，指标保守，群众讥之为促退派的“试验田”。
    茂名县委原来要求全县第一批干部试验田要在2月28日播完种子，部分干部迟迟不动手，到本月4日为止，播种数只达计划的三成。春耕季节已经开始了，有的干部连试验田的地点都还未选定。
    有的干部试验田的产量指标又相当保守，落在群众的后面。县委原要求水稻试验田亩产稻谷一千五百斤以上，花生亩产五百斤以上。可是，据公馆、镇罡两乡的统计，全乡有六十八个干部种水稻试验田有二十三个干部的试验田亩产指标在一千斤以下。镇罡乡党委书记顾志立的试验田的亩产量计划也只有一千斤。在种花生试验田的四十八个干部中，有三十二个干部的试验田的亩产量指标都在五百斤以下。牛头乡同星社的不少稻田亩产量早已达到一千斤，但是社干部陈英文的试验田，亩产指标也只是一千斤。群众说，要是学他的样，就只能后退。
    还有些干部的试验田只有一个空洞的增产指标，没有相应的增产措施。有的干部名为种试验田，实则人未下田。目前，这些情况已引起当地领导上的注意，领导机关在采取措施加以纠正。
