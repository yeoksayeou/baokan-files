Why?

    Bumps on the Face
    Human skin contains a gland specifically for secreting oil, called the sebaceous gland. Sebum protects the skin, making it oily and preventing it from being softened by water. If the opening of the sebaceous gland is blocked by small plugs formed by a mixture of sebum, dust, and shed epidermal cells, preventing the sebum from being discharged, small bumps will form. These bumps have a small blackhead at the top, and a yellow-white, powder-like substance can be squeezed out by hand. These small bumps generally do not itch or hurt, disappear very slowly, and new ones constantly appear. These bumps are called acne, pimples, or comedones. If bacteria invade and cause inflammation, they become small red papules, and after suppuration, they become small pustules. This is acne and pustular acne. After healing, generally no scars remain. If the acne is the size of a small mung bean, slightly tender to the touch, hard, and located deeper, it is very likely to leave scars.
    Acne mainly occurs on the face, followed by the upper chest, between the shoulder blades, and other areas. It occurs more frequently in young people, especially young men, and generally heals spontaneously after the age of twenty-five or twenty-six. The causes, in addition to the vigorous sebum secretion in young people, include excessive mental stress, fatigue, poor digestion, constipation, dental caries, lack of vitamin A and B2, excessive consumption of oily and high-carbohydrate foods, and endocrine disorders. In addition, people who often do not keep their skin clean, people who regularly take iodine and bromine-containing drugs internally, and people who often come into contact with asphalt, tar, and lubricating oil at work are prone to acne.
    The treatment, in addition to first eliminating the causative factors, involves patients washing their faces two or three times a day with hot water and soap. Hot water can dilate the sebaceous gland openings, which is conducive to soap washing away dirt and accumulated sebum, thereby reducing the chances of sebaceous gland openings being blocked and secondary bacterial infections. If acne is caused by contact with tar, protective ointment can be applied to the face before going to work, and after work, hands and face should be thoroughly washed, and clean clothes should be worn.　　　　　　(Zhang Chengzhi)

### 脸上长疙瘩

专栏：为什么？

    脸上长疙瘩
    人的皮肤里有一种专门分泌脂肪的腺体，叫作皮脂腺。皮脂能保护皮肤，使它油润，防止它被水浸软。假如皮脂腺的腺口被皮脂、灰尘、脱落的表皮细胞混合成的小栓子所堵塞，排不出皮脂去，就要形成一个个小疙瘩，顶端有个小黑头，用手一挤可以挤出一条黄白色粉浆样的东西来。这些小疙瘩一般没有痛痒，消退很慢，并且不断有新的起来。这疙瘩叫做粉刺、壮疙瘩、面疱。如果被细菌侵入，引起发炎，就变成红色的小丘疹，化脓后成小脓疱，这就是痤疮和脓疱性痤疮。好了以后，一般不留疤痕。如果痤疮有小绿豆大小，轻度压痛，硬，位置较深，就很可能留下疤痕的。
    粉刺主要发生在面部，其次是上胸部、两肩胛之间等处。青年人特别青年男人发生的比较多，一般到二十五、六岁后大都会自愈。发生的原因，除了青年人皮脂分泌旺盛外，精神过度紧张、疲劳、消化不好、大便秘结，龋齿，缺乏维生素甲、乙2，油和高碳水化合物食物吃得过多，内分泌障碍等都是因素。此外，皮肤常不清洁的人，经常内服碘、溴类药物的人，工作中常和沥青、焦油、滑润油接触的人都容易发生粉刺。
    治疗的方法，除了首先是排除致病因素外，患者每天应用热水、肥皂洗脸二、三次。热水可以使皮肤脂腺口扩张，有利于肥皂洗去污垢和淤积的皮脂，因而减少了皮脂腺口堵塞和细菌继发感染的机会。由于接触焦油而生痤疮，则可以在脸上涂上防护油膏再去工作，工作完后彻底洗手、洗脸、换穿干净的衣服。　　　　　　（张成志）
