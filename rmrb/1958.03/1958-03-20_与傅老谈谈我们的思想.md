Let's talk to Old Fu about our thoughts.

While imparting a lot of chemical knowledge to our students, we have also instilled many bourgeois viewpoints and ideas, fostering tendencies towards arrogance and detachment from politics among them. From the perspective of socialism and the interests of the people, such teaching is a losing proposition! What is increased is merely body weight, while what is lost is the soul. A person without a soul is scrap as far as socialism is concerned. Is cultivating scrap worthy of the people, worthy of the students? Are you a bit surprised by this outcome? Are we willing to let knowledge, experience, and enthusiasm bear such fruit? Is a patriot willing to sit idly by as their hard work yields such results? I believe the answer to these questions can only be "no." Therefore, this is a tragedy. In fact, professors in the chemistry department have, to varying degrees, participated in such a tragedy. I myself am deeply mired in such a tragedy.

So, what exactly keeps us trapped in this tragedy? Besides our own bourgeois viewpoints and ideas, what else could it be? The day our bourgeois viewpoints and ideas are not cleansed, the day we cannot escape this tragedy. Only through ideological remolding can we extricate ourselves from such a tragedy. The scientific validity of this conclusion is no less than that of 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O. However, accepting this conclusion from the bottom of our hearts is much more difficult than accepting the chemical conclusion. In the past, many bourgeois intellectuals only paid lip service, while their hearts remained unconvinced. I myself was like this. I spoke of remolding, but thought about it very little. Such hypocrisy is truly unacceptable. This time, we must burn away this bad thing. You, on the other hand, are consistent in word and deed. You express revulsion toward ideological remolding, and your heart probably feels the same. But in the raging fire, has your view changed? Allow me to ask this of you as a patriotic scientist. Then, do you agree that a person who does not want to escape such a tragedy is by no means a patriot? The only way to get rid of such a tragedy is through ideological remolding. Can someone who still doesn't accept this truth be called a scientist?

Why do we find it easy to accept 2H2 + O2 = 2H2O, but difficult to accept ideological remolding? Abstractly speaking, the former itself has no class nature, while the latter is a problem that arises from the transformation of one class into another. Specifically, we all profess to be noble and pure, but in reality, personal dignity or interests or fame and fortune are paramount. We complacently believe that we can get by on our professional skills alone, and that as for socialism and the people, it is enough to simply contribute our professional skills. Old Fu, are our thoughts somewhat similar? Can you modify and add to them?

Is it enough to simply contribute our professional skills to socialism and the people? Let's not talk about things far away, but just about the situation in the chemistry department. We have been dissatisfied with the situation in the chemistry department in the past, but what exactly were we dissatisfied with? From what angle did this dissatisfaction stem? Recently, after reading the big-character posters, as well as visiting the exhibition of defective products and the anti-waste exhibition by the graduates, I have begun to have a clearer understanding of the true situation in the chemistry department. Chemistry department graduates have produced many defective products; on the one hand, young teachers have not been cultivated for a long time, while on the other hand, they are developing ideas of fame and fortune and becoming detached from politics; there is a lack of unity and cooperation among professors; the role of the Party organization is difficult to play, and so on. These are no small matters, but how did these situations arise? Who should bear the main responsibility? What should be done? In the past, we always thought that the department lacked certain traditions; that so-and-so lacked ability; that so-and-so had ideological problems, but we were never able to get to the crux of the matter. This time, after setting the fire ablaze, the answer has emerged. There is such an atmosphere in the department that professors only need to contribute their professional skills to socialism and the people! And the higher the professor, the more it seems to be the case! Why do graduates want to become teaching assistants? Why do many young teachers prefer to engage in research rather than detach themselves from politics? Why don't professors pay attention to cultivating new forces? Why is it difficult to achieve unity and cooperation? Why is it difficult to promote work in the department? As long as this atmosphere exists, the situation in the department will be like this. Once this atmosphere is swept away, we can expect to see a change in the chemistry department.

But how can we sweep away this worst atmosphere? I'm afraid the answer cannot be anything other than the more one is a professor, the more one must accept the leadership of the Party, carry out ideological remolding, care about politics, and give one's heart to the Party and the people. Intellectually, I think this conclusion is very correct, but in my thoughts and feelings, there is still a great deal of distance. Recently, I have been constantly persuading myself in my mind, and I am also summoning the courage to dig out the things in my thoughts that conflict with it in a do-or-die manner, and gradually establish a new outlook on life. I believe that as long as we are determined and cooperate with the big-character posters and assistance from comrades, our thoughts and feelings will gradually change. The night before last, when I listened to Vice President Lu Ping's report, I saw Old Fu taking notes, which shows that in this great movement, everyone is changing. The question is whether we can hoist a full sail and ride the waves. We sincerely hope that Old Fu will also make a determination to make a great leap forward in ideological remolding and be determined to be a thoroughly patriotic, both red and expert, good professor.

### 与傅老谈谈我们的思想

    与傅老谈谈我们的思想
    我们在交给同学很多化学知识的同时，向同学灌输了很多资产阶级观点和思想，助长了同学自高自大和脱离政治的倾向。这样的教学从社会主义和人民的利益看来是得不偿失的！增加的不过是体重，失掉的却是灵魂。没有灵魂的人，对社会主义来说是废品。培养废品对得起人民，对得起同学吗？这样的效果你是不是有点意想不到？难道我们愿意让学识、经验和干劲结出这样的果实来吗？难道一个爱国者愿意坐视自己的辛勤劳动得出这样的效果吗？我相信，这些问题的答案只能是“不”。因此这是一个悲剧。其实，化学系的教授在不同程度上都参予了这样的悲剧的。我自己也深深地陷在这样的悲剧中。
    那末，究竟什么东西使我们身在悲剧而不自拔？除了我们自己的资产阶级观点和思想外，难道还能是别的什么东西？我们的资产阶级观点和思想一天不清洗，我们就一天不能摆脱这个悲剧。只有进行思想改造，我们才能从这样的悲剧中自拔。这个结论的科学性一点不比2H2＋O2＝2H2O差。但我们要从内心来接受这个结论，却要比接受化学上的结论困难得多。过去很多资产阶级知识分子只是口服，心里并不服。我自己也是这样。嘴里说改造，心里想得很少。这种口是心非实在要不得。这次一定要烧掉这个坏东西。你在这方面倒是心口如一，嘴里说对思想改造有反感，心里大概也不会有不同。但在熊熊大火中，你的看法有没有改变呢？允许我以一个爱国的科学家来要求你。那末，你同意不同意：不想从这样的悲剧中自拔的人决不是爱国者。摆脱这样的悲剧，只有思想改造一途。现在再不接受这个真理的人还能是科学家吗？
    为什么我们接受2H2＋O2＝2H2O容易，接受思想改造困难呢？抽象的说，前者本身没有阶级性，而后者是从一个阶级改造成为另一个阶级中发生的问题。具体地说，我们都是标榜清高，实则个人的尊严或兴趣或名利至上。满以为靠自己的业务吃饭就行了，至于对社会主义和人民只要交出点业务就够了。傅老，我们的想法是否有点相像，可不可以来个修改和补充？
    对社会主义和人民是不是只要交出业务就够了呢？不从远处说，就从化学系的情况来说吧。我们过去也曾对化学系的情况不满意过，但过去究竟对哪些地方不满意？这种不满意是从什么角度出发的？最近我看了大字报，以及毕业生废次品展览会和反浪费展览会，才对化学系的真实情况开始清楚起来了。化学系毕业生出了不少废品；青年教师一方面长期培养不起来，一方面却在滋长着名利思想，脱离政治；教授之间不团结、不合作；党组织的作用很难发挥等等。这些西瓜不能说不大，但这些情况怎样产生的？谁应负主要责任？应该怎样办？我们过去总以为系中缺乏某些传统；某某人能力不够；某某人思想有问题，但从未能接触到关键。这次放火一烧，答案出来了。系里有着这样一种风气，教授倒只要对社会主义和人民交出点业务就够了！而且教授越大，好像就越只有这样！毕业生为什么想当助教？为什么不少青年教师宁可脱离政治来搞研究？为什么教授对培养新生力量不重视？团结和合作搞不好？为什么系里工作很难推动？只要这个风气存在，系里的情况就会这样。这个风气一经扫除，化学系改观当可拭目以待。
    但怎样扫除这个最坏的风气呢？恐怕答案不能不是越是做教授的，越要接受党的领导，进行思想改造，关心政治，把心交给党和人民。这个结论从理智上说，我认为很正确，但在我思想感情上至今仍很有隔阂。我最近经常在思想中进行自我说服，一面也正在鼓起勇气，破釜沉舟地挖去思想中与它抵触的东西，逐渐建立新的人生观。我相信我们只要下定决心，配合同志们的大字报和帮助，我们思想情感是会逐渐转变的。前天晚上听陆平副校长报告时，我看见傅老在记笔记，这一点说明在伟大的运动中，每个人都在转变。问题在于我们能不能挂个满帆，来乘风破浪。我们衷心希望，傅老也下个决心，在思想改造中来个大跃进，立志做个又红又专的不折不扣的爱国者、好教授。　唐有祺　　3月14日
