Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th -- According to Taiwan newspapers, before the Spring Festival, the vicious cycle of bankruptcies in Taiwan's industrial and commercial sectors had spread throughout Taiwan. The bankruptcy of the Taipei City Da Dong Bicycle Factory was a particularly shocking event in the recent wave of industrial and commercial collapses in Taiwan. This privately-run enterprise could produce more than 30,000 bicycles annually and had always been known as Taiwan's "central factory." However, due to oversupply of products and heavy tax burdens, the bicycle factory declared bankruptcy before the Spring Festival. Hundreds of large and small factories and shops in Taipei also went bankrupt on the eve of the Spring Festival.

　　Tainan City, with only 6,000 industrial and commercial households, had more than 50 closures by the end of last year.

　　When discussing the fundamental reasons for the widespread bankruptcies of Taiwan's industrial and commercial sectors, Taiwan newspapers acknowledged that the low purchasing power of the Taiwanese people, leading to oversupply of goods, coupled with the heavy tax exploitation by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, have become the "death knell" for Taiwan's industrial and commercial businesses. The "preferential conditions" granted to American goods in Taiwan, allowing them to be dumped at low prices, is also one of the reasons for the large-scale collapse of Taiwanese factories.

    产品滞销重税压榨美货倾销
    台湾工商业大批倒闭
    据新华社广州28日电　据台湾报纸报道，春节前，台湾工商业的恶性倒风已蔓延整个台湾。台北市大东自行车厂的倒闭，是近来台湾工商业倒风中特别引起台湾社会人士震动的一个事件。这家民办企业每年可出产自行车三万多辆，一直被称为台湾的“中心工厂”。但是由于产品滞销和重税压榨，这家自行车厂在春节前宣告破产倒闭。台北市还有几百家大小工厂和商店在春节前夕倒闭。
    只有六千家工商业户的台南市，在去年年底倒闭了五十多户。
    在谈到台湾工商业纷纷倒闭的根本原因时，台湾报纸承认，台湾人民购买力低落，以致商品滞销，加以蒋介石集团的重税压榨，都成为当前台湾工商业的“催命符”。美国货在台湾获得“优惠条件”贱价倾销，也是造成台湾工厂大批倒闭的原因之一。
