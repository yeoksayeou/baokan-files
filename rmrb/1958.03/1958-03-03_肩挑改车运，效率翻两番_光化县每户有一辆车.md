Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th — Guanghua County, Hubei Province, has changed from human carrying to cart transport, doubling labor efficiency and creating a new situation in production.

    Currently, this county has an average of one cart per household, and the phenomenon of human carrying has been eliminated in production. Now, from the hills to the plains, the teams delivering manure to the fields are composed of all kinds of vehicles. In the past, when the county applied fertilizer once, almost all the labor force participated, which took about twenty days. Now, using only half the labor force, it can be completed in seven days. Many teenagers or elderly people who have lost their ability to work can use carts to deliver manure. For example, by placing a basket on a three-pronged weeder and harnessing an ox, one can transport hundreds of pounds of fertilizer at a time. Changing from human carrying to cart transport has played a significant role in tapping labor potential.

    Guanghua County began to change the phenomenon of shoulder carrying last winter. At that time, the water conservancy project had a large task and a small labor force, so everyone decided to focus on improving tools. In just half a month, the phenomenon of people carrying soil was eliminated at all water conservancy construction sites throughout the county, doubling work efficiency. Soon, weeding began, and the masses created and improved many tools, increasing work efficiency by about ten times. Then, topdressing began, and the county completed "cartization" within seven days.

    In the process of changing from human carrying to cart transport, this county fully relied on the masses, self-repairing, self-managing, self-using, and with public support. The Liuhe Cooperative in Zhaogang Township originally made carts within the team, but relying solely on the cooperative and team to build carts was both few and slow. Later, the cooperative bought eight sections of trees and mobilized the members to make carts themselves. Overnight, they built eighteen types of carts, a total of one hundred and fifty vehicles, which was many, fast, good, and economical. As a result, improving tools formed a mass movement. Materials were taken locally, and waste was utilized. Broken wooden boxes, rotten wooden cabinets, and even old tables were fitted with wheels. A tree branch was cut, and wooden wheels and a sieve were installed to become a small cart. There are as many as fifty kinds of carts in the county.

### 肩挑改车运，效率翻两番  光化县每户有一辆车

    肩挑改车运，效率翻两番
    光化县每户有一辆车
    新华社武汉28日电　湖北省光化县改人挑为车运，使劳动效率翻了两番，在生产上出现了新局面。
    目前，这个县平均每户有一辆车子，在生产上已经消灭了人挑的现象。现在这个县从丘陵到平原，送粪下地的队伍，都是由各式各样的车辆组成的。过去全县追一次肥，几乎所有的劳动力都参加，也得二十天左右，现在，只用半劳动力，七天就可结束。许多十来岁的少年或丧失劳动能力的老人，都可以使用车子送粪。例如，在三齿耘锄架上放个筐子，套上个牛，一次可运肥百把斤。人挑改车运，对挖掘劳动潜力起了很大作用。
    光化县改变肩挑现象是从去年冬天开始的，当时水利工程任务大，劳动力少，因而大家便在改良工具方面打主意。前后仅半个月的时间，全县所有的水利工地上消灭了人挑土的现象，使工效翻了一番。不久，锄草开始，群众又创造、改良很多工具，使工效提高了十倍左右。接着，追肥又开始，全县在七天内完成了“车子化”。
    这个县在改人挑为车运中，充分地依靠群众，自修、自管、自用，民办公助。赵岗乡六合社原来是队里造车，可是光靠社、队造车，既少又慢。以后社里买了八截树，发动社员自己动手造车，一夜之间，造成了十八种共一百五十辆车，又多又快，又好又省。于是，改良工具形成了群众性的运动。就地取材，利用废物。破木箱、烂木柜，连破旧的桌子，都安上了轮子。砍个树杈，安上木轮、筛子，便成为一辆小车。全县各种各样的车子达五十种之多。
