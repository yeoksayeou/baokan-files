	Notes
	Isn't it too pathetic?
	After several failures, the American "Vanguard" rocket finally managed to send a tiny satellite weighing only a little over three pounds into the sky. This was originally not something worth boasting about. However, Washington's propagandists have actually started exaggerating, claiming that the launch of this tiny satellite would "greatly strengthen" America's position at the summit conference.
	The summit conference is not a satellite competition, so why would this tiny satellite "greatly strengthen" America's position? Washington's propagandists did not answer this question, but people can find the answer in the words of Hagen, the head of the "Vanguard" rocket program. He said that although the "Vanguard" satellite's entry into orbit falls within the scope of the International Geophysical Year, it also has its military value.
	It seems that it is probably this "military value" that will strengthen America's position!
	However, the satellite with "military value" only weighs a little over three pounds, while the Soviet Union's second satellite weighs more than one thousand one hundred pounds. In comparison, America's position is indeed too pathetic.
	Difficult Indeed
	At a time when U.S. President Eisenhower is racking his brains over how to alleviate the increasingly serious economic crisis at home, "U.S. News & World Report" reported that Eisenhower is already drafting his 1958 election campaign plan. It is said that this plan includes two main points: (1) to try to make the economy improve before autumn, so that voters will forget the current "difficult period" by then; (2) to flaunt "peace talks" in order to cater to voters' desire for peace.
	It seems that Eisenhower is quite experienced in deceiving voters, knowing well what voters like and dislike. The problem is: (1) Can Eisenhower find a way to make the economy improve? (2) Everyone is currently demanding high-level talks, which he is doing his best to obstruct. If he then offers empty promises of "peace talks" at the time of the election, will he still be able to deceive voters?
	"U.S. News & World Report" said: "The election prospects in November are beginning to worry the White House at this time." This observation is clearly not without reason.

    札记
    未免太可怜
    美国“先锋”号火箭在几经失败后，好容易才把一颗只有三磅多重的小小卫星送上了天。这本来是不值得怎样夸耀的事情。然而，华盛顿的宣传家们却竟然大吹大擂起来，说什么这颗小小卫星的发射会使美国在最高级会议上的地位“得到很大加强”。
    最高级会议又不是卫星比赛大会，为什么这颗小小的卫星就会使美国的地位“得到很大加强”呢？华盛顿的宣传家们没有解答这个问题，但是人们却可以从“先锋”号火箭负责人哈根的谈话中得到解答。他说，虽然“先锋”号卫星射入轨道是属于国际地球物理年范围的，可是它还有其军事价值。
    看来，大概就是这个“军事价值”会加强美国的地位吧！
    可是，那颗具有“军事价值”的卫星毕竟只有三磅多一点，而苏联的第二颗卫星却有一千一百多磅。相形之下，美国的地位也未免太可怜了。
    难矣哉
    在美国总统艾森豪威尔目前正在为如何缓和国内日益严重的经济危机而弄得焦头烂额的时候，“美国新闻与世界报道”报道说，艾森豪威尔已在拟定1958年的竞选方案。据说这项方案包括有两个主要内容：（一）设法使经济在秋季以前有起色，以便使选民到时候忘掉现在的这个“艰苦时期”；（二）标榜“和平会谈”，借以迎合选民希望和平的情绪。
    看来，艾森豪威尔在欺骗选民方面是颇有经验的，深知道选民之所好和所恶。问题是：（一）艾森豪威尔是否能有办法使经济有起色？（二）目前大家都要求高级会谈，他竭力阻挠，到选举时再胡开“和平会谈”的空头支票，是否还能使选民受骗？
    “美国新闻与世界报道”说：今年“11月的选举前景在这个时候就开始使白宫感觉忧虑。”这种观察显然不是没有道理的。
