Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 7th. Shen Manyun, the director of the residents' committee of Xiaoying Lane in Hangzhou, on the 5th, at the Zhejiang Provincial Congress of Active Elements in Women's Diligence and Thrift in Building the Nation and Managing the Household, on behalf of all the residents of the district, issued a friendly challenge to urban residential areas across the country to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene. Chairman Mao inspected the sanitation work in this residential area in January.

The residents of this residential area guarantee that they will basically eliminate the "five pests" (flies, mosquitoes, rats, cockroaches, and bedbugs) before the "May Day" Labor Day. The entire residential area will achieve "four cleans" (clean indoor, clean environment, clean personal hygiene, clean kitchen and toilet), "eight clears" (clear out mosquitoes and flies caught and killed over the winter, clear out all fly pupae, clear out all rats, clear out all bird nests, clear out all dead corners and dark corners, turn over unused basins and cans, clear out and dredge all sewers and manholes, block all holes), "five diligences" (diligent haircuts and hair washing, diligent changing of clothes, diligent washing of bedding, diligent bathing and foot washing, diligent nail trimming) and "four no's" (no spitting anywhere, no littering of paper scraps and fruit peels, no defecating or urinating anywhere, no eating raw, cold, or unclean food), universally promote the use of serving chopsticks, and use separate face towels.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the Xiaoying Lane residential area has successively established a system of daily small cleanups and bi-monthly major cleanups, daily small inspections and weekly major inspections, assigned responsibility for cleaning streets, and monthly evaluations. This residential area has also organized a sub-command for eliminating the seven pests and has established a joint defense system with the surrounding five residential areas to ensure the complete elimination of the five pests.

    城市居民也起来竞赛
    小营巷下了除四害挑战书
    新华社杭州7日电　杭州市小营巷的居民委员会主任沈曼云五日在浙江省妇女勤俭建国、勤俭持家积极分子代表大会上，代表全区居民向全国城市居民区提出除四害讲卫生的友谊挑战。毛主席在一月曾经查看过这个居民区的卫生工作。
    这个居民区的居民保证要在“五一”劳动节前做到基本上消灭“五害”（苍蝇、蚊子、老鼠、蟑螂、臭虫）。整个居民区做到“四洁”（室内洁、环境洁、个人洁、橱房厕所洁）、“八光”（过冬蚊蝇捕打光、全部蝇蛹挖光、老鼠捉光、雀窝捣光、一切死角、暗角消灭光、不用的盆罐翻光、阴沟窨井疏通光，一切洞穴堵塞光）、“五勤”（勤理发洗头、勤换衣、勤洗被褥、勤洗澡洗脚、勤剪指甲）和“四不”（不随地吐痰、不乱丢纸屑果皮、不随地大小便、不吃生冷不洁食物），普遍推广公筷制，分用脸巾。
    为了保证以上任务的完成，小营巷居民区已经先后建立起每日小扫除和半月大扫除、每天小检查和每周大检查、分工包干打扫街道和每月评比一次的制度。这个居民区还组织除七害分指挥部，并和周围的五个居民区建立了联防制度，以保证五害彻底除尽。
