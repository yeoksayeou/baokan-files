What Role Does the Iraqi-Jordanian "Federation" Play?
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    After Egypt and Syria announced the establishment of the United Arab Republic, it has already had a positive impact throughout the Middle East. It has strengthened the unity of the Arab people and inspired their common struggle against colonialism and for the defense of national independence. Therefore, the people of all Arab countries warmly welcome the birth of this republic. On March 2, the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser, and the Crown Prince of Yemen, Badr, jointly announced at a mass rally in Damascus that Yemen had decided to join the United Arab Republic on a federal basis. This is another joyous event for the Arab people, marking a further development in the unity of the Arab people.

    However, the situation is completely different with the so-called "Federation" announced by Iraq and Jordan. As everyone knows, Iraq is a member of the imperialist aggressive bloc, the Baghdad Pact, and its policies are not independent and autonomous; Jordan has already accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and its ruling clique is entirely dependent on foreign forces to maintain its rule. What role will these two countries suddenly play in establishing a "Federation"? American officials have frankly admitted that "the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation gives America's two friends in the Arab world a banner of 'unity'." The United States wants to use this "unity" as a cover to "unite" these two Arab countries it controls in order to compete with the United Arab Republic and undermine the unity of the Arab people.

    The establishment of the Iraqi-Jordanian "Federation" also means that imperialism has strengthened its control over these two countries, especially Jordan. The "Iraqi-Jordanian Federal Agreement" stipulates that "international treaties, conventions, and agreements that were binding on either of the two countries before the establishment of the 'Federation' shall continue to be effective for the original contracting parties," and at the same time, the two countries will "unify foreign policy and external diplomatic representation." This is, in effect, forcing Jordan to implement the policies of the Baghdad Pact group, and dragging Jordan into this aggressive group through the back door.

    Precisely because of this, the establishment of the Iraqi-Jordanian "Federation" has been opposed by the people of Iraq and Jordan from the very beginning. In recent days, patriotic people in many cities and towns in Iraq and Jordan have held large-scale demonstrations and parades, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Baghdad Pact," "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine," and "Abolish the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation." The frantic suppression of these patriotic people by the Iraqi and Jordanian authorities has failed to contain the rising tide of mass resistance. This clearly shows that the imperialist conspiracy to use the Iraqi-Jordanian "Federation" has been exposed. What the Arab people demand is to strengthen genuine unity and to strengthen their common struggle against colonialism and for the defense of national independence. This historical trend cannot be stopped by imperialism.

    伊约“联邦”扮演什么角色？
    本报评论员
    埃及和叙利亚宣布成立阿拉伯联合共和国以后，已经在整个中东产生积极的影响。它加强了阿拉伯人民的团结力量，并且鼓舞了阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义和保卫民族独立的共同斗争。因此，阿拉伯各国人民都热烈欢迎这个共和国的诞生。3月2日，阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔和也门王太子巴德尔在大马士革的群众大会上共同宣布，也门决定在联邦基础上，参加阿拉伯联合共和国。这又是阿拉伯人民的一件喜事，它标志着阿拉伯人民的团结进一步发展了。
    但是伊拉克和约旦宣布成立的所谓“联邦”，情形却完全不同。谁都知道，伊拉克是帝国主义侵略集团巴格达条约的成员国，它所执行的政策并不是独立自主的；约旦已经接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，它的统治集团是完全依靠外国势力而维持统治的。这样两个国家突然宣布成立“联邦”，究竟扮演什么角色呢？美国官方人士曾经直言无讳地承认：“伊约联邦给美国在阿拉伯世界的两个朋友一面‘统一’的旗帜”。美国就是要利用这个“统一”的幌子，把它所控制的这两个阿拉伯国家“联合”起来，以便同阿拉伯联合共和国唱对台戏，破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结。
    伊约“联邦”的建立，也意味着帝国主义加强了对这两个国家，特别是对约旦的控制。“伊约联邦协定”规定，在成立“联邦”以前“已对两个国中任何一国发生约束力的国际条约、公约和协定将对原缔约国继续有效”，同时两国又将“统一外交政策和对外外交代表”。这实际上等于强迫约旦执行巴格达条约集团的政策，等于把约旦从后门拖进了这个侵略集团。
    正因为这样，伊约“联邦”的建立，首先就遭到伊约两国人民的反对。最近几天，伊拉克和约旦许多城镇的爱国人民连续举行了大规模的示威游行，他们高呼“打倒巴格达条约”，“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”，“取消伊约联邦”等口号。伊约两国当局对这些爱国人民进行的疯狂镇压，并未能抑制住广大群众的反抗浪潮。这就很清楚地表明，帝国主义利用伊约“联邦”的阴谋诡计已经被揭穿了。阿拉伯人民所要求的是加强真正的团结，是加强他们进行反殖民主义和保卫民族独立的共同斗争。这个历史趋势是帝国主义阻挡不了的。
