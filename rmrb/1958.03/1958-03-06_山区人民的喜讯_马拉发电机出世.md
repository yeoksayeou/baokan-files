    Good News for People in Mountainous Areas:
    Horse-Drawn Generator is Born
    Kunming, March 5th (Reported by this newspaper) - The locally state-owned Chuxiong Electrical Machinery Factory in Yunnan Province has successfully trial-produced a horse-drawn generator, which has been warmly welcomed by farmers in mountainous areas.
    This generator is powered by one horse and generates 600 watts of electricity per hour. It can power forty 15-watt light bulbs, show small films, and be used for rural broadcasting. Silkworm rearing is an important household sideline in the local area. According to experiments, under normal circumstances, the growth period of silkworms is 40 days, but if electric lights are used for illumination at night, it only takes 21 days. The horse-drawn generator is of great significance for developing the silkworm rearing sideline.
    By slowing down the speed of this machine, it can also be used as power for other machinery: when used on a threshing machine, it can replace the work of six people; when used for blowing air, it can manage four stoves, replacing four people; when used for water lifting, it can replace six to eight people; when used for rice milling, three people can manage it and mill 3,000 catties of rice per day. In addition, it can also be used as power for chopping grass, oil pressing, cotton ginning, cotton fluffing, and so on.
    The cost of each horse-drawn generator is 550 yuan. The entire equipment weighs only a little over 150 kilograms, is simple to operate, and easy to install. It doesn't matter if it's crooked, making it very suitable for the needs of mountainous areas. After visiting, farmers in various counties of the Chuxiong Special Zone responded very well. Dayao County requested to buy 100 units at once. Iron factories in various counties have also requested to study at the factory and manufacture them themselves to meet the needs of farmers.

    山区人民的喜讯
    马拉发电机出世
    本报昆明5日电　云南省地方国营楚雄机电厂试制马拉发电机成功，受到山区农民热烈欢迎。
    这种发电机用一匹马拉动，每小时发电量为六百瓦，可点十五支光的灯泡四十个，可放映小型电影及供农村广播之用。养蚕是当地重要的家庭副业之一，据试验，在正常情况下当地的蚕成长期是四十天，如果晚间用电灯照射，则只要二十一天就够了。马拉发电机对发展养蚕副业有重大的意义。
    把这种机器调慢转速，还可以用作其他机械的动力：用在打谷机上，可以代替六个人工作；用来鼓风，可以管四个炉子，代替四个人；用来车水，可以代替六至八人；用来碾米，三个人管，一天可碾大米三千斤。此外，还可以用作铡草、榨油、轧花、弹花等等的动力。
    每台马拉发电机的成本是五百五十元，全部设备只一百五十多公斤，操作简单，安装简便，歪的斜的都没关系，很适合山区要求。楚雄专区的各县农民参观后反映很好，大姚县一次就提出要买一百台。各县的铁工厂也要求到该厂学习，自己制造，以满足农民的要求。
