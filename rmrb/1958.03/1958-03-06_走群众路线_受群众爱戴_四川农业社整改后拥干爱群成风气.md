Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Special Dispatch: Since the 190,000-plus agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province entered the stage of rectification, the working style of the vast number of cooperative cadres has undergone a significant leap forward.

Before the rectification, a considerable number of cooperative cadres lacked sufficient understanding of the power of the masses, and had shortcomings such as taking over everything and resorting to coercion in management and leadership of production; in addition, some cooperative cadres were afraid to struggle against erroneous ideas among the masses in promoting advanced technology and formulating production plans, and held one-sided views of the masses. These two shortcomings were not only detrimental to the work but also easily aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, causing some cooperative cadres to feel distressed. During this rectification, the cadres of agricultural cooperatives in various places, based on the opinions put forward by the masses, overcame the above-mentioned shortcomings, established a working style based on the mass line, and completely renewed the face of their work.

At present, cadres of agricultural cooperatives in various places are resolutely implementing the system of democratic management of finance, practicing regular public disclosure of accounts, and convening everyone for consultation and research whenever there are major expenditures. In the Nanchong Special District, 90% of the cooperatives have publicly disclosed their financial expenditures, and all misunderstandings among the members have been eliminated.

Many cadres of agricultural cooperatives have also thoroughly corrected the shortcomings of taking over everything and resorting to coercion in leading their work. Now, new phenomena such as cooperative cadres going out and returning with the members, jointly overcoming difficulties, and organizing on-the-spot debates when there are differences in opinion are appearing everywhere. In the past, the Liberation Agricultural Cooperative in Jianyang County did not consult with the members when repairing water conservancy projects, and subjectively required the members to fill in the old drainage canals before the new drainage canals were completed, causing floods that inundated fields and several houses, resulting in a disaster. During this rectification, the cadres of the cooperative changed their style, and this year, when building water conservancy projects, the entire process from surveying to construction was repeatedly discussed and approved by the members' representatives, and on-the-spot debates were organized whenever problems were encountered. As a result, the irrigation capacity increased eightfold, basically achieving water conservancy.

This rectification also enabled some cooperative cadres to correct their one-sided view of the masses and correct the shortcomings of accommodating erroneous ideas in technological reforms, formulating plans, and distributing income. During the rectification in the Suining Special District, the shortcomings of some cadres who were afraid to struggle against the backward ideas of the masses were specifically criticized, enabling the cooperative cadres to further understand the relationship between democracy and centralism, and the mass line.

After the vast number of cooperative cadres established a working style based on the mass line, they were deeply loved and supported by the masses. The atmosphere of supporting cadres and loving the people is becoming increasingly strong.

### 走群众路线　受群众爱戴  四川农业社整改后拥干爱群成风气

    走群众路线　受群众爱戴
    四川农业社整改后拥干爱群成风气
    本报特约新华社成都专讯  四川省十九万多个农业社进入整改以来，广大社干部的工作作风有了很大的跃进。
    整改以前，有相当一部分社干部对群众的力量认识不足，在经营管理和领导生产等方面有包办代替和强迫命令的毛病；另外有一部分社干部在推广先进技术和制订生产计划等方面不敢向群众中的错误思想作斗争，存在着片面的群众观点。这两种毛病既不利于工作又容易引起群众不满，致使有些社干部感到苦恼。这次整改中，各地农业社的干部根据群众提出的意见，克服了上述缺点，树立了群众路线的工作作风，使工作面貌完全更新。
    目前，各地农业社干部都坚决执行民主管理财务的制度，实行定期公布账目，遇有较大开支都召集大家商量研究。南充专区有90％的社公布了财务开支，社员们的误解全部消除了。
    许多农业社的干部也狠狠地改掉了领导工作中的包办代替和强迫命令的缺点。现在，社干跟社员们同出同归、共同克服困难，思想不一致便就地组织辩论等新气象到处出现。简阳县解放农业社过去修水利不和社员们商量，主观地要求社员在新的排水渠道没有修成以前，先填了旧的排水渠道，洪水下来冲淹了田地和几间房子，造成水灾。该社干部在这次整改中转变了作风，今年兴修水利时，从勘测到施工全经社员代表反复讨论和通过，遇有问题就地组织辩论，结果灌溉能力增加八倍，基本上实现水利化。
    这次整改也使部分社干部改掉了片面的群众观点，纠正了在技术改革、制定计划、分配收益等方面迁就错误思想的毛病。遂宁专区在整改中，曾专门批判了某些干部不敢向群众的落后思想作斗争的缺点，使社干部对民主和集中的关系，对群众路线有了进一步的理解。
    广大社干部树立了群众路线的工作作风以后，深受群众爱戴。拥干爱群的风气日益浓厚。
