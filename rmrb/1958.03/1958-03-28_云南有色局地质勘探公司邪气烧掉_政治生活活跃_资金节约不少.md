The Yunnan Nonferrous Metals Bureau Geological Exploration Company Burns Away Evil Influences; Political Life is Active; Significant Savings in Funds

(Our newspaper Kunming, 27th) The five evil influences existing among the leading cadres of the Yunnan Nonferrous Metals Bureau Geological Exploration Company have been largely overcome in the two months since the People's Daily criticized them on February 17th, after being washed away by the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. Currently, the company's democratic life is unprecedentedly active, political and ideological work has been greatly strengthened, and the cadres' enthusiasm is soaring. They have re-examined the geological exploration design and this year's Great Leap Forward plan, saving more than 12 million yuan compared to the preliminary design. They will also explore an additional 800,000 tons of various nonferrous metal ores and iron ore while reducing investment.

During the "Double Anti" movement, the company discovered that all the prospecting teams and some of the exploration teams, due to the company's weak political and ideological work in the past, and the prospectors working in deep mountains and dense forests for many years with very poor theoretical study, were seriously apolitical. For example, they did not respect the leadership of the local Party committees; some people advocated that technology was above everything else, and so on. The company leadership, not long ago, concentrated all the personnel of five prospecting teams in Kunming to conduct a thorough airing of views and debates on special topics such as whether to respect the unified leadership of the local Party committees and the relationship between "Red" and "Expert." Based on the improvement of thinking, they formulated a system whereby all exploration and prospecting teams would be under the dual leadership of the local Party committees and the company Party committee. The company also selected capable cadres to work in the prospecting teams to carry out Party work, strengthen political study, and establish a normal political work system. Individual leading cadres who have consistently violated laws and regulations have been removed from their positions. The level of awareness of the prospectors has generally improved.

    云南有色局地质勘探公司邪气烧掉
    政治生活活跃　资金节约不少
    本报昆明27日电　云南有色金属管理局地质勘探公司领导干部中存在的五股邪气，经2月17日人民日报提出批评以后，两个月来经过反浪费反保守运动的洗刷，已经基本克服。目前，这个公司的民主生活空前活跃，政治思想工作大为加强，干部的干劲高涨。他们重新审定了地质勘查设计和今年的跃进计划，比初步设计节约了一千二百多万元资金。他们还要在减少投资的情况下，额外勘探八十多万吨各种有色金属矿和铁矿。
    在双反运动中，这个公司发现所有的普查队和一部分勘探队，由于公司过去政治思想工作薄弱，以及普查队员长年累月在深山密林中工作，理论学习很差，非政治倾向十分严重。如不尊重地方党委的领导；有人主张技术高于一切等等。公司领导方面在不久以前，集中了五个普查队的全部人员在昆明进行大鸣大放，就是否应该尊重地方党委的统一领导、红与专等问题进行专题辩论，在思想提高的基础上制定了所有勘探队和普查队一律由地方党委和公司党委双重领导的制度。公司还选派得力干部到普查队作党的工作，加强政治学习，建立正常的政治工作制度。个别一贯违法乱纪的领导干部已经撤职。普查队员们的觉悟水平普遍提高。
