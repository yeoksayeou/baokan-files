Let Local Specialties Stand Tall in the Great Leap Forward
Wild Grasses and Seeds are All Treasures
Seeking Oil and Sugar from the Deep Mountains, Seeking Cotton and Hemp from the Jungles:
Sichuan Develops Wild Plant Processing Business

(Our report) In the Great Leap Forward of industrial and agricultural production, many supply and marketing cooperatives in Sichuan Province have broken away from purely business viewpoints and right-leaning conservative thinking, eliminated all fears of difficulty, and launched a high tide of marching towards local specialties, seeking oil, wine, sugar, and flour from the deep mountains, and seeking paper, cotton, hemp, and glue from the old forests.

Sichuan abounds in wild plants and various medicinal materials that can be used to extract oil, obtain flour, brew wine, and manufacture fiber. In the past year alone, more than 130 kinds of wild oil plants have been discovered. After preliminary identification, more than 30 kinds have large yields, high oil content, and development value, such as Masang seeds, Mountain Cang seeds, and Water Gourd seeds. Among them, the annual output of Mountain Cang seeds is estimated to be at least 18,600 dan. Each dan of Mountain Cang seed kernels can extract three to four jin of high-grade fragrant oil (containing more than 80% citral); each dan of Mountain Cang seed husks can yield 18 to 25 jin of oil. Mountain Cang seeds alone can produce hundreds of thousands of jin of oil annually. Masang seeds are the best raw material for the paint and soap industries, with an oil yield of 13%, and the estimated annual output of the entire province is more than 2 million jin. Old Fir Tree seeds are also wild oil plants, with an oil yield of more than 40%, and can be used to replace tung oil in making soap or lighting lamps. The recently successfully extracted wutong tree seed oil is even more fragrant than sesame oil. The Sichuan Provincial Oil Industry Department plans to increase production by 22,000 tons this year, of which more than half of the increased oil production will come from the use of wild oil plants. In addition, fern roots can be used to make lotus root flour, vermicelli, and also to brew wine. The annual output of Nanjiang County alone is as high as 1 billion jin. Guangyuan County has recently purchased 4.4 million jin of fern roots in two months, which can produce 880,000 jin of white wine, creating wealth of 460,000 yuan for the country and saving 1.5 million jin of grain. Lycoris radiata can be used as a raw material for alcohol, sizing yarn, making paste, or extracting a valuable medicine that used to be imported - lycorine. Such wild starch can be found in foothills, embankments, cemeteries and other shady and humid areas throughout Sichuan. There are also abundant wild raw materials that can be used to make rayon. Santai County alone produces 16 million jin of Miscanthus sinensis, which can be used to make rayon, plus 2 million jin of cotton stalk bark produced locally. These two items can produce about 13.4 million jin of rayon annually, which is more than twice the cotton output of the 230,000 mu of cotton fields in Santai County.

In order to develop these local specialties, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system has made an unprecedented leap forward in its procurement plan. Among them, the wild fiber procurement plan has leapt from 650,000 dan to 2.9 million dan; the wild oil plant procurement plan has leapt from 60,000 dan to 100,000 dan; and the wild starch procurement plan has leapt from 200,000 dan to 600,000 dan. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have actively taken action to carry out procurement. The Zhong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative system employees put forward the friendly competition slogan of "Hundred Kinds, Ten Thousand Dan" to brother cooperatives, and organized "cadres to go to the mountains, funds to go to the mountains, and business to go to the mountains." The supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Fengjie County have established development teams for mountain goods sources, and the Hechuan County organized cadres to go to the mountains to help agricultural cooperatives use barren mountains and wasteland to plant more than 30,000 nests of tung seeds and about 20,000 plants of Arctium lappa and Gardenia jasminoides. The Jiangyou County Wudu Supply and Marketing Cooperative's small local and special product procurement plan has leapt to 1.8 times that of last year, with peanut fruits and Chinese gall increasing by one to two times; tea, tung seeds, palm strips and other products have also been greatly expanded, and the procurement plans for 34 new products such as wild oil plants and wild fibers have been added.

Many supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also adapted to the economic characteristics of mountainous areas, established various small-scale processing plants with low investment and high returns, and actively carried out the trial processing of wild plants. The Fengjie County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is preparing to establish small-scale ginning factories, medicinal material sorting and packaging processing plants, and starch processing plants to implement on-site procurement and on-site production. The Wanxian Special District plans to establish 835 mu of medicinal material production bases. The Guangyuan Alcohol Factory will use fern roots to brew wine in the future. In Beichuan County, three districts have completely replaced grain with wild starch for brewing wine, and local sugar workers also use wild ramie roots to make sugar.

### 向深山要油糖　向丛林要棉麻  四川开展野生植物加工业务

    让小土产在大跃进中扬眉吐气
    野草野籽样样是宝
    向深山要油糖　向丛林要棉麻
    四川开展野生植物加工业务
    本报讯　在工农业生产大跃进中，四川省许多供销社打破单纯业务观点和右倾保守思想，消除一切畏难情绪，掀起了向小土产进军的高潮，向深山要油、要酒、要糖、要粉，向老林要纸、要棉、要麻、要胶。
    四川各地盛产可以榨油、取粉、酿酒、制造纤维的野生植物和各种药材。一年来，仅野生油料就发现了一百三十多种。经过初步鉴定，产量大、含油量高、有开发价值的有马桑籽、山苍籽、水瓜籽等三十多种。其中山苍籽年产量估计最少有一万八千六百担。山苍籽仁每担可提炼高级香料油（含柠檬醛80％以上）三、四斤；山苍籽核每担可榨油十八至二十五斤，仅山苍籽一种，每年就可产油几十万斤。马桑籽是油漆、肥皂工业最好的原料，出油率为13％，估计全省年产量达二百万斤以上。杉老树籽也是野生油料，出油率达40％以上，可以代替桐油制造肥皂或点灯。最近试榨成功的梧桐树籽油，比芝麻油还香。四川省油脂工业部门今年计划增产二万二千吨，其中利用野生油料增产的油脂占了一半以上。此外，蕨苔根可以做藕粉、粉条，也可以酿酒，仅南江县年产量就达十亿斤。广元县最近两个月已收购了蕨苔根四百四十万斤，可制白酒八十八万斤，可为国家创造财富四十六万元，可节约粮食一百五十万斤。石蒜可用来做酒精原料、浆纱、做浆糊或者提炼出一种过去需要进口的名贵药品——石蒜碱。四川各地山麓、堤塘边、墓地等阴湿地区都可以找到这种野生淀粉。可以制人造棉的野生原料也很丰富，仅三台县就年产可制人造棉的蓑草一千六百万斤，加上当地年产的棉秆皮二百万斤，这两项每年即可产人造棉花一千三百四十万斤左右，比三台全县二十三万亩棉田产的棉花产量还多一倍。
    为了开发这些小土产，四川省供销合作社系统作了空前跃进的收购计划，其中野生纤维采购计划由六十五万担跃进为二百九十万担；野生油料收购计划由六万担跃进为十万担；野生淀粉收购计划由二十万担跃进为六十万担。很多地区的供销合作社都积极行动起来，进行采购。忠县供销合作社系统职工以“百种万担”的跃进口号向兄弟社提出友谊竞赛，并组织“干部上山、资金上山、业务上山”。奉节县各区供销合作社建立了开发山区货源小组，合川县组织干部上山，帮助农业社利用荒山，荒地种植桐籽三万多窝和大力子、黄枝子等药材约二万株。江油县武都供销社小宗土特产采购计划跃进到去年的一点八倍，其中花生果、五棓子增大了一倍至两倍；茶叶、桐籽、棕片等产品也扩大很多，并且增加了三十四种野生油料、野生纤维等新产品的采购计划。
    很多地区的供销合作社还适应山区经济特点，建立花钱少、收效大的各种小型加工厂，积极开展野生植物的加工试制业务。奉节县供销社准备建立小型轧花厂、药材整理包装加工厂、淀粉加工厂等，实行就地收购、就地生产。万县专区计划建立药材生产基地八百三十五亩。广元酒精厂今后将全部用蕨苔根酿酒。北川县有三个区已全部用野淀粉代替粮食酿酒，当地制糖工人还用野苎麻根制糖。
