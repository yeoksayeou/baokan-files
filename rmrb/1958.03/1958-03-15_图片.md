    Residents of Dongjia Lane in the Xisi District of Beijing used to have to go to the grain supply store on Xisanmen Street to buy grain, which was a long and inconvenient journey. At the rectification meeting, residents raised this issue. The next day, the relevant departments reassigned the residents in this area to the Zhantansi Grain Store to buy grain. When Xu Jingru, an elderly woman living at 6 Chuantangmen, came to the grain store to buy grain, the salesperson Sun Weimin even helped her carry it home.

    北京市西四区东夹道的居民，过去要到西安门大街粮食供应店去买粮食，路远很不方便。在整风会上，居民提出了意见。第二天，有关部门就把这一带居民改到旃坛寺粮店去买粮了。住在穿堂门六号的居民徐静如老大娘来粮店买粮，售货员孙伟民还帮她扛回家去。
