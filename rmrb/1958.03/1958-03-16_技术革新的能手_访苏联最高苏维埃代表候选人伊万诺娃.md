    A Technical Innovation Expert
    ——An Interview with Ivanova, Candidate for Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
    By Our Correspondent Chen Quanbi
    On the morning of the 14th, I visited a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR—Ivanova, a female worker from the Ilyich Electrical Factory in the Moscow River District. She is an ordinary Soviet citizen, but she is deeply loved and respected by the Soviet people because of her outstanding contributions to her motherland, to communist construction, and to the broad masses of voters.
    This is the first time that Ivanova has been elected as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet. When we met, she could not contain her inner joy and excitement.
    Ivanova was born into a peasant family in the North Caucasus. At the age of sixteen, she joined a collective farm and engaged in agricultural labor. In 1937, she came to Moscow from her hometown and entered the current Ilyich Electrical Factory to work, and has been there ever since. Her original level of education was not high, but now she has grown into an expert with a high level of culture and proficiency in electrical technology.
    Ivanova told me that from February 1953 to February 1958, a full five years, she put forward rationalization proposals every year. Due to the adoption and implementation of these proposals, production has increased by one to one and a half times. Her first rationalization proposal was put forward in February 1953, changing part of the manual labor on the lathe she operated to automation, which increased productivity by one time. The second time, at the beginning of 1954, she proposed to use machines to manufacture some parts that could only be manufactured by hand in the past. To this end, she designed a machine for manufacturing this tool, which improved both the output and quality of the tool. The third time was at the end of 1955, when she proposed to use drill bits of different sizes to drill holes simultaneously on the tool for manufacturing steel discs, whereas in the past only one hole could be drilled at a time with one drill bit. The fourth time was in 1957, when she proposed methods for saving manpower and improving tools, reducing the number of people operating the lathe she operated from three to one, increasing the productivity of each lathe from 100 small gears per seven hours to 400. In February of this year, she made her fifth rationalization proposal, using a conveyor belt made of a new raw material to replace the conveyor belt made of leather in the past. Because the conveyor belt made of this raw material is strong, has high friction, and runs fast, the turnover rate will increase by 15% when transporting raw materials and finished products. In this way, each worker operating the conveyor belt can save two working days per month. Ivanova is now not only a role model for the workers of the Ilyich Electrical Factory, but also a banner of technical revolution for all electrical factories in the Soviet Union.
    Ivanova is not only a production expert and a technical innovation expert, but also a model of enthusiastic social work. Although she is so busy with production, she still tries to take time out for trade union work. She cares about the daily lives of the workers and pays great attention to the health of the workers and the safety equipment of the factory. She has put forward suggestions such as improving the workers' bathroom facilities, eliminating congestion during commuting, and improving workshop hygiene. Ivanova regards the workers in her workshop and the entire factory as her own brothers and sisters. Whoever has difficulties and goes to her, she will try her best to help them.
    Ivanova is also an upright and just person who is brave to do what is right. In recent years, she has been serving as a people's assessor in the Moscow River District. She often handles and mediates some disputes between residents and fights against illegal phenomena. She once encountered such a thing: in a factory in the Moscow River, a factory director dismissed a typist based on insufficient reasons. After Ivanova's exposure and struggle, the typist's job was finally restored.
    Ivanova's outstanding production achievements and noble qualities have won the love of the people, and she has been nominated as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR this time. She told me that she never dreamed that an ordinary Soviet female worker like her could be elected as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet. Thinking of the past suffering years and the care of the Party and the government for her now, her tears couldn't help but pour out like a spring. She said that when her husband heard the good news, he excitedly bought a big cake and a bottle of wine at the market and brought them home to congratulate her. For the past twenty days, their whole family has been completely immersed in joy, as if they were celebrating every day. As soon as she gets off work, her home is really crowded, and villagers and neighbors come to congratulate her.
    Ivanova finally told me that being elected as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet is her greatest honor. She must work harder in production in the future, serve the people more faithfully, and live up to the trust given to her by the voters. (Picture attached)

### 技术革新的能手——访苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人伊万诺娃

    技术革新的能手
    ——访苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人伊万诺娃
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    14日上午，我访问了一位苏联最高苏维埃候选人——莫斯科河区伊里奇电气工厂的女工伊万诺娃。她是一个普通的苏维埃人，但是却深深地受到苏联人民的爱戴和尊敬，因为她对自己的祖国、对共产主义建设、对广大的选民有着杰出的贡献。
    伊万诺娃是第一次当选为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。我们见面时，她抑制不住内心的喜悦和激动。
    伊万诺娃出生在北高加索的一个农民家庭里，十六岁便参加集体农庄从事农业劳动。1937年她由故乡来到莫斯科，进入现在的伊里奇电气工厂做工，直到今天。她原来的文化程度并不高，但是现在她已成长为一个具有高度文化和精通电工技术的专家了。
    伊万诺娃告诉我，她从1953年2月到1958年2月的整整五年中，年年都提出合理化建议。由于采纳和推行了这些建议，生产提高了一倍到一倍半。她的第一次合理化建议是在1953年2月提出的，把她所操纵的车床上的一部分手工劳动改为自动化，使生产率提高了一倍。第二次在1954年年初，她提议把一部分过去只能用手工制造的零件改用机器制造。为此，她设计了制造这种工具的机器，使工具的产量和质量都提高了。第三次是在1955年底，她提出在制造钢盘的工具上，采用大小不同的钻头同时钻孔的方法，而过去只是一个钻头一次只能钻一个孔。第四次是在1957年，她提出节省人力和改进工具的方法，在她操纵的车床上由三个人减少到一个人，使每个车床的生产率由过去的每七小时生产一百个小齿轮增加到四百个。今年2月，她第五次提出合理化建议，用一种新的原料制成的运输带来代替过去用皮子做的运输带。因为用这种原料制成的运输带耐力强，磨擦力大，运转快，在运送原料与成品时，运转率就会提高15％。这样，使每个操纵运输带的工人每月能节省出两个劳动日。伊万诺娃现在不仅是伊里奇电气工厂工人们的榜样，而且成为全苏电气工厂技术革命的一面旗帜。
    伊万诺娃不仅是个生产能手，技术革新的能手，而且还是热心社会工作的模范。她虽然生产那么忙，但还是尽量抽出时间进行工会工作。她关心工人们的日常生活，非常注意工人们的健康和工厂的安全设备。她曾提出改善工人浴室设备、消除上下班时的拥挤现象、改善车间卫生等项建议。伊万诺娃把自己的车间和整个工厂的工人，看成是自己的亲兄弟和亲姐妹。谁有困难去找她，她都想尽办法帮助他们。
    伊万诺娃还是一个正直公正、见义勇为的人，最近几年来，她一直担任着莫斯科河区人民陪审员的职务。她经常处理和调解居民间的一些纠纷，并同违法现象进行斗争。她曾经遇到这样一件事情：在莫斯科河一个工厂里，一个厂长根据不充分的理由开除了一个打字员。经过伊万诺娃的揭发和斗争，终于恢复了那个打字员的工作。
    伊万诺娃卓越的生产成绩和高贵的品质，获得人民的爱戴，这次被提名为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。她对我说，像她这样一个普通的苏联女工能当选为最高苏维埃代表的候选人，真是她自己做梦也没有想到过的。想起以前的苦难岁月和现在党和政府对自己的关怀，她的眼泪就不自主地像泉水一样地涌了出来。她说，当她的丈夫听到这个喜讯的时候，兴奋地到市场上买了一个大蛋糕和一瓶葡萄酒回家向她祝贺。二十天来，她们全家完全浸沉在欢乐中，好像天天办喜事一样。只要工厂一下班，她的家真是门庭若市，乡亲和邻居都来向她祝贺。
    伊万诺娃最后向我表示，当选最高苏维埃代表是她的莫大光荣，她今后一定要更加努力生产，更忠诚地为人民服务，不辜负选民给她的信任。（附图片）
