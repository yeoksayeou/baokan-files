In Local Newspapers

    Promoting Granulated Fertilizer Production Techniques
    The Qinghai Daily on the 20th, in a front-page headline on the second page, reported on the training class for granulated fertilizer factory cadres held in Huangzhong County. This training class was organized by the Rural Work Department of the County Party Committee in Liangqi Commune, Dongbao Township, which was the first to establish a granulated fertilizer factory. Sixty-two cadres from twenty-nine townships participated in the study. After four days of learning, they learned some basic theories, mastered the entire process of manufacturing granulated fertilizer, and increased their confidence in establishing fertilizer factories. Some township cadres are determined to mobilize every commune to set up granulated fertilizer factories after they return. The newspaper also published four photos introducing the production process of the Liangqi Commune granulated fertilizer factory.
    The Snowball Rolls Well!
    Ji’an County in Jilin Province is rich in underground mineral resources. From 1956 to the present, this county has adopted the "snowball" method, relying on the masses to mine nine small mines, producing 328 tons of galena, 200 tons of talc, 300 tons of barite, and 350 tons of mica, with a output value of 230,000 yuan. Inspired by the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the county decided to continue using the "snowball" method during the second five-year plan, without asking the state for money, to open 69 more small mines. It is now vigorously organizing the masses to mine placer gold, mica, asbestos, and other minerals. The gold mine originally planned to be completed in 1959 will also be completed ahead of schedule this year. The Jilin Daily on the 23rd used the large-character headline "Ji'an as an Example for Running Small Mines" on the second page.
    Opening the Wanbao Mountain
    Opening Wanbao Mountain, the wealth is inexhaustible. The Shanxi Daily on the 23rd reported on the first page that the people of Qinyuan are launching a large-scale march into the treasure mountain, using mountain resources to develop local industries. The Qinyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently determined a plan to build 86 medium and small factories in this mountainous area within five years, including more than ten industries such as brewing, sugar making, oil, dairy products, starch, alcohol, medicinal materials, and papermaking. The newspaper also published an editorial "The Road of Industry Ascending the Mountain," explaining that Qinyuan’s practice of developing local industries based on the characteristics of mountainous areas is worthy of learning from all over. The second page also published an interesting "Wanbao Mountain" column, using pictures to illustrate the various uses of wild fibers, wild animals, and wild fruits.
    Unexpected Harvest
    Leveling the land is truly a multi-benefit endeavor. The Southern Daily reported on the 21st: In the 230,000 mu of fields that have been leveled in Jieyang, due to the relocation of graves and leveling of field foundations, not only were 11,202 mu of fields expanded, but also, in the process of leveling the land, more than 430,000 field rats and more than 60,000 venomous snakes were eliminated. They estimate that these two pests have been eliminated by 90%. (Attached picture)
    This is the "Wanbao Mountain" column on the second page of the Shanxi Daily on March 28.

    推广粒肥制作技术
    20日青海日报二版头条报道了湟中县举办颗粒肥料厂干部训练班的消息。这个训练班是由县委农村工作部在第一个建立颗粒肥料厂的东堡乡两旗社举办的。参加学习的有二十九个乡的干部六十二人。经过四天的学习，他们学到了一些基本理论，掌握了制造颗粒肥料的全部过程，提高了建立肥料厂的信心。有些乡的干部决心回去后发动每个社都办颗粒肥料厂。报纸还发表了四幅照片，介绍两旗社颗粒肥料厂的生产过程。
    雪球滚得好！
    吉林有个辑安县，地下矿藏丰富。这个县从1956年到现在，采取“滚雪球”的办法，依靠群众开采了九个小矿，生产出方铅三百二十八吨，滑石二百吨，重晶石三百吨，云母三百五十吨，产值达二十三万元。在工农业大跃进的形势鼓舞下，这个县决定在第二个五年计划期间，不向国家要钱，继续用“滚雪球”的办法，再开办六十九个小型矿。现正大力组织群众开采砂金、云母、石棉等矿产。原计划在1959年建成的金矿也要提前在今年建成。23日吉林日报用大字标题“要办小矿辑安作榜样”登在二版上。
    打开万宝山
    打开万宝山，财富取不完。23日的山西日报一版报道了沁源人民向宝山开展大进军，利用山区资源发展地方工业的消息。中共沁源县委最近确定规划，五年内要在这个山区，新建八十六个中、小型工厂，其中包括酿酒、制糖、油脂、乳制品、淀粉、酒精、药材、造纸等十多个行业。报纸并发表了“工业上山之路”的社论，说明沁源这种根据山区特点发展地方工业的作法，值得各地学习。二版并发表了一个有趣的“万宝山”专栏，以图画说明野生纤维、野生动物、野生果品等各种用途。
    意外的收获
    平整土地，真是一举数得。21日南方日报报道：在揭阳已整理过的二十三万亩田地上，由于移坟平整田基，不仅扩大了一万一千二百零二亩田；并且在平整土地的过程中，附带消灭了四十三万余只田鼠和六万多条毒蛇。他们估计，这两害已被消灭九成。（附图片）
