    Implementing "Following-the-Shift Labor System"

    How can we thoroughly improve leadership style and working methods in industrial enterprises? This is a question of concern to everyone. The report on the Tianjin Second Printing and Dyeing Factory's deputy director and other leading cadres implementing a following-the-shift labor system, published on page two of today's newspaper, answers this question with vivid facts. During the rectification movement, the leading cadres of this factory put forward the slogan of "cadres becoming workers, life becoming like the masses, and labor becoming regularized." Many cadres worked alongside workers in the workshops as ordinary workers, establishing a brotherly relationship with the worker masses and completely eliminating bureaucratic airs. Some unreasonable rules and regulations were broken through. An unprecedented atmosphere of unity appeared in the factory, and the infinite production enthusiasm hidden in the masses erupted like a volcano. Some long-standing key production problems were readily solved.
    The transformation of the leadership style and leadership methods of this factory is a concrete application of the experience of planting experimental plots in Hong'an County in factories and enterprises. It is a great leap forward in leadership style, leadership methods, and production management methods.
    In the rectification movement, we must eliminate all bureaucratic airs, lethargy, arrogance, extravagance, and affectation; and for many leading cadres, the most important thing is to get rid of bureaucratic airs. The essence of bureaucratic airs is detachment from reality and detachment from the masses. One manifestation is treating the masses with a noble, master-like attitude, considering oneself extraordinary and superior. Another is working without going deeply, leading in a generalized manner, and being satisfied with "principle" leadership. They do not understand the problems in their work, or the thoughts of the masses, or they understand them very vaguely. It is as if a person is suspended in mid-air, looking down from a height, and may see some of the situation below, but it is vague and unclear. This kind of bureaucratic air seriously hinders the labor enthusiasm of the workers and masses, prevents many key production problems from being solved, and thus restricts the development of productive forces. To break this restriction, we must first make the workers truly feel that the factory director is not an official but is the same as the workers, only with a different division of labor. The deputy director of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory rarely contacted workers in the past. Sometimes when he went to the workshop, he only looked at the statistics on the blackboard newspaper, and didn't even speak to the workers. The workers called him the "blackboard factory director" and "Official Liu," saying that his visit to the workshop was a "parade-style deep dive." But when the deputy director worked alongside the workers in the shift, the workers' perception immediately changed, and they regarded the deputy director as one of their own. When the deputy director assigned any task, the workers immediately started working on it. Such a change occurred in a short period of time. This vivid example tells us that implementing the following-the-shift labor system is a practical and feasible way for factory leading cadres to completely eliminate bureaucratic airs and closely connect leadership with the masses.
    Consulting with the masses in everything is our Party's fine tradition. The Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us that we must implement the Party's mass line in all our work. To do this, an important prerequisite is that we must learn from the masses. Only those who are good at being students of the masses can become teachers of the masses; only by seriously summarizing the experiences of the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses can we correctly decide on problems. Therefore, the Party's mass line itself requires us to maintain a humble and cautious attitude, requiring enterprise leading cadres to put down their airs when contacting workers, be good at listening to various opinions, and concentrate the wisdom and experience of the masses to guide our work. After the deputy director and others of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory followed the shift to work, they created good conditions for implementing the Party's mass line. When they worked with the workers, they learned from the veteran workers and technical personnel, listened to their opinions in a timely manner, consulted with them on everything, and solved a series of key production problems. From then on, the factory leading cadres further realized the important significance of implementing the Party's mass line for running enterprises well, and learned the methods of following the mass line. As one of the factory's leading cadres said: "In the past, we only guided the workers, but now we are also guided by the workers." All enterprise leading cadres should go deep into the worker masses in the guise of ordinary laborers. We must both guide the workers and accept the workers' opinions; and we should listen to the workers' opinions first in order to correctly guide the workers. If we do not do this, we will inevitably fall into the quagmire of bureaucracy and subjectivism, detached from reality and the masses.
    The experience of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory shows that factory leading cadres who want to be both red and expert, who want to unify politics and technology, and who want to combine physical and mental labor, have a shortcut, which is to implement "following-the-shift labor." As early as 1949, Chairman Mao said in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The serious task of economic construction lies before us. What we are familiar with will soon be laid aside and we are being forced to do things that we are not familiar with. This is the difficulty." "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand." At present, under the inspiring slogan of "catching up with Britain in fifteen years," the people of the whole country are engaged in heroic labor. In order to complete this historic task, a large number of proletarian experts who are both red and expert are needed. However, at present, many factory leading cadres do not understand technology, or only understand a little, and have not become experts. Therefore, they are still unable to lead production with confidence, and their work is always stagnating at the original level. If these comrades do not catch up quickly, the times will leave them far behind. Their original redness will slowly fade and gradually weaken. This is very dangerous. But how to learn technology and become an expert? There are various ways: one can learn from books, one can ask people to teach. But the most important way is to learn from practice, to implement following-the-shift labor, and to learn next to the machines. This method of combining theory with practice is not only a good way to solve the problem of being both red and expert, but also an effective measure to realize the combination of physical and mental labor.
    After the leading cadres of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory implemented following-the-shift labor, they also promoted a great leap forward in production management. Some people suspect that factory production is highly centralized, and that leading cadres, especially the factory director, must understand the overall situation and grasp all aspects. If they follow the shift to work and go deeper, will they "lose the big picture for the small," and get more harm than good? Facts have proved that this suspicion is groundless. When leading cadres follow the shift to work, they can discover many problems in depth, create typical experiences in practice, and thus drive the whole process through one point, and better guide the overall situation. Chairman Mao told us long ago: "In whatever work we do, we Communists must use two methods. One is to combine the general with the individual, and the other is to combine the leadership with the masses." After the deputy director and others of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory followed the shift to work, they better promoted the work of the whole factory and realized the combination of the general with the individual and the combination of the leadership with the masses because they deeply understood the reality of production and grasped the typical. The deputy director realized in his work that unreasonable conventions restricted the development of productive forces, and immediately supported the workers' opinions and broke through the conventions. This did not hinder his duties as deputy director at all. He also bears the responsibility of leading the production of the whole factory. Although there is a certain contradiction between following the shift to work and performing the duties of the factory director, this contradiction can be completely resolved and must be resolved. If it is resolved well, it will promote the overall improvement of work. After the deputy director of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory went to the workshop, the work of the departments was immediately adjusted accordingly, many unnecessary meetings and reports were streamlined, and the factory director changed the method of directing production from the department and went deep into production to lead production, so that the departments served production. Therefore, a series of new changes quickly appeared in production management. Now, this factory is preparing to implement further reforms, drawing ten people from the existing sixteen cadres to follow the shift for a few hours every day, and the remaining six people are required to follow the shift for a certain amount of time every week. In this way, it will more comprehensively promote a great leap forward in factory production management.
    The method of following-the-shift labor has universal significance and should be promoted. Leading cadres of one hundred and fifty-one large and medium-sized factories in Tianjin have generally implemented the method of following-the-shift labor. The results of the promotion in these one hundred and fifty-one factories prove that this method can be implemented not only in factories with simple production processes, simple products, and small numbers of people, but also in factories with complex production processes, diverse products, and large numbers of people. Although these factories vary in the number of people, the level of technology, the equipment conditions, and the complexity of the products, they can all adopt the method of following-the-shift labor to lead production. As for the specific methods of following-the-shift labor, of course, various flexible forms should be adopted according to the specific conditions of each factory, and it should not and cannot be forced to be uniform. You can follow the shift for a few hours every day, or you can follow the shift for a few hours every other day. In short, our enterprise leaders should not stand next to the machines and gesticulate, or walk around with their hands in their pockets, acting as "parade-style" leaders.
    Of course, in implementing this reform, we will encounter various difficulties. However, as long as we make full use of favorable factors, treat difficulties specifically, and overcome difficulties. When the comrades of the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory first implemented the following-the-shift labor system, they encountered many difficulties. They did not retreat in the face of difficulties, but mustered up revolutionary enthusiasm, first set aside the difficult factors, actively looked for favorable factors, used these favorable factors to overcome difficulties, and formulated a series of methods and systems to adapt to the new situation, and boldly carried out experiments. As a result, they not only achieved following-the-shift labor, but also improved the level of production management and continuously increased production, setting a good example for factories and enterprises.

### 实行“跟班劳动”

    实行“跟班劳动”
    在工业企业中怎样彻底改进领导作风和工作方法呢？这个问题是大家关心的。今天本报第二版发表的天津第二印染厂副厂长和其他领导干部实行跟班劳动制的报道，用生动的事实回答了这个问题。这个工厂的领导干部在整风中提出了“干部工人化，生活群众化，劳动经常化”的口号，许多干部以普通工人的姿态到车间同工人一起干活，同工人群众建立了亲如兄弟的关系，彻底打掉了官气。一些不合理的规章制度被突破了，工厂中就出现了空前团结的气象，蕴藏在群众中的无穷的生产积极性像火山爆发一样地喷射出来，一些长期没有得到解决的生产关键问题迎刃而解。
    这个厂的领导作风和领导方法的转变，是红安县种试验田的经验在工厂企业中的具体运用，是领导作风、领导方法和生产管理方法的大跃进。
    我们在整风运动中，要扫除一切官气、暮气、骄气、阔气、娇气；而对许多领导干部说来，最重要的还是打掉官气。所谓官气，实质上就是脱离实际、脱离群众。它的一种表现是以贵族老爷式的态度对待群众，自命不凡，高人一等。另一种是工作不深入，领导一般化，满足于“原则”领导。工作中的问题，群众中的思想，他们不了解，或者了解得很不具体。就好像一个人悬在半空中一样，居高临下，下面的情况可能看到一些，但又模模糊糊，看不真切。这种官气，严重地妨害了工人群众的劳动积极性，使生产中许多关键问题不能得到解决，因而束缚了生产力的发展。要打破这种束缚，就必须首先使工人真正感到厂长不是官老爷，而是同工人一样，只是分工不同。第二印染厂的副厂长平时很少和工人接触，有时到车间转一转，也只是看看黑板报上的统计数字，见了工人连话也不说。工人叫他是“黑板厂长”“刘官”，说他到车间是“阅兵式的深入”。但是当副厂长和工人一起跟班劳动的时候，工人的看法马上改变了，把副厂长当做自己人。副厂长要分配什么任务，工人们马上就干起来。在短短的时间内就发生这样的变化，这个生动的实例告诉我们：实行跟班劳动制，是工厂领导干部彻底打掉官气、密切领导与群众的关系的切实可行的办法。
    遇事同群众商量，这是我们党的优良传统。党和毛主席一再教导我们：在一切工作中必须贯彻执行党的群众路线。要做到这样，一个重要的前提就是必须向群众学习。只有首先善于做群众的学生的人，才有可能做群众的先生；只有认真地总结群众的经验，集中群众的智慧，才能正确地决定问题。因此，党的群众路线本身就要求我们保持谦虚谨慎的态度，要求企业领导干部同工人接触时放下架子，善于听取各种不同的意见，集中群众的智慧和经验，来指导我们的工作。第二印染厂副厂长等跟班劳动以后，为贯彻执行党的群众路线创造了良好的条件。他们在同工人一起劳动的时候，向老工人、技术人员学习，及时听取他们的意见，遇事和他们商量，解决了一系列的生产关键问题。工厂领导干部从此也进一步体会到贯彻执行党的群众路线对办好企业的重要意义，学会了走群众路线的方法。正如这个厂的一位领导干部说的：“过去光是指导工人，现在也受工人指导。”一切企业的领导干部，都应该以普通劳动者的姿态，深入到工人群众中去。既要指导工人，又要接受工人的意见；而且应该首先听取工人的意见，才能正确地指导工人。如果不这样做，那就必然会陷到脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义、主观主义的泥坑里去。
    第二印染厂的经验说明，工厂领导干部要做到又红又专，要叫政治与技术统一，要叫体力劳动与脑力劳动相结合，有一条捷径就是实行“跟班劳动”。毛主席早在1949年就在“论人民民主专政”一文中说过：“严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。”“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”目前，全国人民在“十五年赶上英国”的振奋人心的口号鼓舞下，进行着英勇的劳动。为了完成这个历史性的任务，就需要大批又红又专的无产阶级专家。但是，目前有不少工厂的领导干部不懂得技术，或者只懂得一点，没有成为内行。因此，他们还不能充满信心地领导好生产，工作总是停留在原有的水平上。这些同志如果不急起直追，时代就会把他们远远地抛在后面。他们原有的红色，就会慢慢消褪，逐渐变淡。这是非常危险的。可是，如何学习技术、成为内行呢？有各种各样的办法：可以学习书本上的知识，可以请人来教。但是最重要的办法还是到实践中去学，实行跟班劳动，到机器旁边去学。这种理论联系实际的方法，不仅是解决又红又专的好办法，也是实现体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的有效措施。
    第二印染厂的领导干部实行跟班劳动以后，也促进了生产管理方面的大跃进。有人怀疑：工厂生产是高度集中的，领导干部、特别是厂长，必须了解全局，掌握全面，如果跟班劳动，深入一点，会不会“因小失大”，得不偿失？事实证明，这种怀疑是毫无根据的。领导干部跟班劳动，可以深入发现许多问题，在实践中创造典型的经验，从而可以通过一点，带动全面，更好地指导全局。毛主席早就告诉我们：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的。一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合”。第二印染厂副厂长等跟班劳动以后，由于深入了解生产实际，抓住了典型，就更好推动全厂工作，实现了一般与个别相结合，领导与群众相结合的方法。副厂长在劳动中体会到不合理的成规束缚了生产力的发展，马上支持工人的意见，突破了成规。这对于他所担负的副厂长的职务毫无妨碍。他还担负着领导全厂生产的责任。尽管跟班劳动与执行厂长的职务有一定的矛盾，但是这个矛盾完全可以解决，也必须解决。解决得好，就会促进工作全面提高。第二印染厂副厂长到车间以后，科室工作立即作了相应的调整，精简了许多不必要的会议、表报，厂长改变了站在科室指挥生产的办法，而深入到生产当中去领导生产，使科室为生产服务，因此生产管理方面很快就出现了一系列新的变化。现在，这个厂准备实行进一步的改革，从现有十六名干部中抽出十人每天几小时跟班劳动，其余六个人每周规定一定时间跟班劳动。这样，更将全面地促进工厂生产管理的大跃进。
    跟班劳动的办法具有普遍的意义，应该推广。天津市有一百五十一个大型和中小型工厂的领导干部，已普遍实行了跟班劳动的办法。这一百五十一个工厂推行的结果证明：不仅在生产过程简单、产品简单、人数较少的工厂可以实行这个办法，在生产过程复杂、产品多样、人数多的工厂同样可以实行这个办法。尽管这些工厂人数多少不同，技术高低不一，设备条件和产品的复杂程度也各有区别，但是都可以采取跟班劳动的办法来领导生产。至于跟班劳动的具体作法，当然应该根据各厂的具体条件，采取多种多样的灵活形式，不应该、也不可能强求一律。可以每天跟班劳动几小时，也可以隔日跟班劳动几小时。总之，我们企业的领导者，不要站在机器旁边指手划脚，或者两手插在口袋里走来走去，当“阅兵式的”领导者。
    当然，在实行这项改革时，会遇到种种困难。但是，只要充分利用有利因素，具体地对待困难和克服困难。第二印染厂的同志们在刚刚实行跟班劳动制的时候，遇到了许多困难。他们没有在困难面前退缩，而是鼓起了革命的干劲，先撇开困难的因素，积极寻找有利的因素，用这些有利因素，克服了困难，并且制定了一系列适应新情况的办法和制度，大胆地进行试验，结果不仅做到了跟班劳动，生产管理水平也提高了，生产不断上升，为工厂企业树立了良好的榜样。
