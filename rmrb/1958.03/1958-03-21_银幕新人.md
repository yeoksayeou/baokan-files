New Faces on the Screen

When an unfamiliar face appears on the screen, the audience stares at them with focused attention. What kind of person are they? Here, we offer some brief introductions to several new faces on the screen.

	Yang Wei
	Those who have seen "The Fifth Watch" feel that his portrayal of Secretary Liu is quite appropriate. He comes from a peasant family. He joined the revolution in 1938 and experienced the hardships of life-and-death struggles, which provided him with a foundation for playing the role of Secretary Liu. He is new to the screen, but an old hand on the stage. For twenty years, he has continuously performed on stage, playing major roles in forty-seven large and small plays, and creating many vivid artistic images. He won a second-class actor award at the First National Drama Festival. He is currently the head of the Shanxi Drama Troupe.

	Liu Jiyun
	He usually plays villains, but in "The Fifth Watch," he created a moving positive image. The old and frail appearance of Lao Liangcai and his inner passion for the Party were vividly displayed. Coincidentally, he wears dentures. When filming, he removes his dentures, causing his mouth to sink in, which further matched the weathered appearance of Lao Liangcai. He is an actor in the General Political Department Drama Troupe of the Military Commission and has already filmed three movies: "Breaking Through the Darkness Before Dawn," "The Fifth Watch," and "Yangguan Avenue."

	Wang Yunxia
	She was originally an actress in the Northeast People's Art Theater, and only joined the Beijing Film Studio in 1955, making appearances in films such as "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River" and "Visiting Relatives." On stage, she was known for playing negative characters such as hooligans and young widows. This time, in the film "The Flute Blows Across," she played a positive character - the protagonist Yang Yilan. Although it was a departure from her past roles, she was able to grasp the character of this lovely girl relatively well, and her performance was quite appropriate.

	Huang Yin
	In terms of her love for her artistic career and her spirit of diligent study, she is somewhat like the character she played in "Riding the Wind and Waves" - Liang Ying. She is an overseas Chinese student who returned from Thailand in 1949. She studied dance at the Central Academy of Drama, but this did not satisfy her desire to become a stage actress. If her Mandarin was not good, she practiced. If she couldn't understand something, she delved into it. She did not let go of a single opportunity to learn. Finally, she became an actress in the Beijing People's Art Theater. Over the years, she has played Shura in "Belinsky," the female secretary Ella in "Such a Time," and recently, Zou Lijuan, the little nightingale in "Song of Youth," and so on.

	Tao Yuling
	She is very young, but she is not sloppy when it comes to creation. When the film "Story of Liubao" was shot on location in northern Jiangsu, she worked with local farmers to create a life foundation for the image of the character she played - Er Meizi, making her performance realistic and touching. She has now returned to her original drama troupe - the Frontline Drama Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Not long ago, she played roles in the troupe's stage plays "Ugly Picture" and "The Sick."

    银幕新人
    当银幕上出现了一张生疏的面孔，观众都以关注的目光盯住他。他是怎样的一个人呢？这里，我们对几个银幕新人，作些点滴的介绍。
    杨威
    看过“五更寒”的人，都觉得他扮演的刘书记是比较得体的。他出身农民家庭。1938年参加革命，经历过出生入死的艰苦斗争，为他扮演刘书记这个角色提供了生活基础。他在银幕上是新人，在舞台上却是老将。二十年来，他没有间断过舞台演出，他扮演过四十七个大小剧目中的主要角色，创造过不少生动的艺术形象。在第一届全国话剧会演时，他曾获得演员二等奖。现在他是山西话剧团的团长。
    刘季云
    他一向演反派，但在“五更寒”中，他却塑造了一个动人的正面形象。劳良才老态龙锺的外貌和对党无限忠诚的内心激情，都鲜明地展示了出来。更为凑巧的是，他装着一口假牙，拍戏的时候将假牙取掉，嘴瘪了，这就跟劳良才这个饱经风霜的老人的外貌更加吻合了。他是军委总政治部话剧团的演员，已经拍过三部电影：“冲破黎明前的黑暗”、“五更寒”和“阳关大道”。
    王云霞
    她本来是东北人民艺术剧院的演员，1955年才参加北京电影制片厂工作的，在影片“春风吹到诺敏河”、“探亲记”等中露过面。在舞台上，她是以串演二流子、小寡妇等反面人物称著的，这次在影片“洞箫横吹”中，她却饰演了一个正面人物——主角杨依兰。虽然一反她过去的戏路，但她对这个可爱的姑娘的性格还是比较能够掌握，演得还是得体的。
    黄音
    就她热爱的艺术事业、努力钻研的精神说来，她有点像她在“乘风破浪”中扮演的角色——梁缨。她是1949年由泰国归来的华侨学生，在中央戏剧学院学习过舞蹈，但这满足不了她要做一个话剧演员的要求，国语不好、她练，体会不到、她钻；不放松一个可以学习的机会，终于，她成了北京人民艺术剧院的演员。几年来，她扮演过“布里乔夫”中的舒拉、“这样的时代”里的女秘书艾拉，以及最近“青春之歌”中的小夜莺邹丽娟等。
    陶玉玲
    她很年青，但对于创作却并不苟且。影片“柳堡的故事”在苏北拍外景时，她曾和当地农民一道劳动，为自己扮演的脚色——二妹子的形象创造增添了生活基础，演来真实感人。现在她已经回到她原来所属的话剧团——中国人民解放军前线话剧团去了。不久前，该团演出的舞台剧“百丑图”和“病者”中，都有她扮演的角色。
