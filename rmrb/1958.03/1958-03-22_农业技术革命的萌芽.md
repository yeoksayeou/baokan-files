    The Budding of the Agricultural Technological Revolution
    With the development of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, a mass movement to reform production tools has emerged in rural areas across the country. Carts have replaced carrying poles, and aerial soil transporters, wooden frame mobile tampers, soil cranes, waterwheel soil transporters, and the like have appeared. In Neihuang County, Henan Province, new-style cones are used to dig wells to draw spring water, increasing efficiency by more than 79 times. Many new types of water-lifting tools, including automatic waterwheels, wind-powered waterwheels, and water turbine pumps, have been created in many provinces. Chopping machines and weeding and hoeing machinery are also being invented. Over a thousand new tools and machines have been created and modified nationwide. This is a matter of great significance in China's socialist construction.
    Due to the unprecedented surge in production enthusiasm among the broad masses of farmers, a large-scale high tide of agricultural production, centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, has emerged in rural areas since last winter and this spring, achieving tremendous results. More than 200 million mu of irrigated land and more than 100 billion dan of fertilizer have been added nationwide. This production high tide continues to move forward. In this high tide, we cannot rely solely on the enthusiasm of the masses, nor can we rely solely on increasing labor intensity. We must have various concrete measures, especially technological reforms, to more confidently achieve a great leap forward in production. The significant role of the mass movement to reform production tools lies precisely here.
    This movement is taking place among the masses of farmers directly engaged in farmland water conservancy construction. The creators are mostly farmers, carpenters and blacksmiths among the farmers, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary laborers. Research and experimentation activities are carried out in the fields, ditches, and hillsides. The direct motives of these laborers in reforming old tools and creating new tools are: first, to save and reduce heavy manual labor; second, to improve labor efficiency and speed up project progress and agricultural activities; and third, to save money, labor, and materials, and to replace scarce materials with locally available materials (such as replacing iron pipes with wooden pipes). The new tools they have created have achieved these goals to varying degrees. Some have increased work efficiency by several times, and some by dozens of times. Costs have been reduced by half or even by more than 90%. Things that were previously only used by a small number of agricultural cooperatives are now used by most agricultural cooperatives.
    Obviously, the development of this movement will greatly accelerate the speed of agricultural infrastructure construction and the development of agricultural production as a whole. The difficulty of labor shortages in rural areas due to the great leap forward in production in various fields will find a solution here.
    The current conditions are very favorable for the development of this movement. Because China's socialist relations of production, characterized primarily by the public ownership of the means of production, can promote the accelerated development of social productive forces. The collectivization of agricultural production in China has liberated hundreds of millions of farmers from the shackles of the precarious small-scale peasant economy and plunged them into large-scale collective labor and production. At this time, they no longer need to worry about the fate of their small piece of land. Their energy and wisdom are now focused on one point: how to rapidly develop the collective production of the agricultural cooperative. Large-scale production urgently requires efficient production tools, so it is only natural that the intelligence and wisdom of the producers are concentrated on the reform of production tools. In addition, at present, our party and state organ workers have generally changed their working methods and ideological styles through rectification, stepped out of their offices, and gone deep into the revolutionary and production practices of the broad masses. They have understood the demands and aspirations of the masses, and learned the knowledge and experience of the masses in the struggle for production; at the same time, they have given the broad masses positive encouragement and support, so that all good creations among the masses can overcome the obstruction of conservative ideas and the difficulties of material conditions and achieve victory. This has cleared the way for the rapid development of the movement. Now this movement is still surging forward, and new tools are continuing to emerge.
    However, in some places, the tool reform movement still lacks leadership. Some leading workers still do not know how to further unleash the already liberated productive forces, the high creativity, enthusiasm, and collective wisdom of hundreds of millions of farmers. They have not systematically summarized the rich experience of farmers and handicraft workers in improving production tools, and have not improved on this basis. Therefore, we should now further promote comprehensive cooperation among all regions and departments across the country, and promote mutual visits and exhibitions everywhere. For example, the Cangxian Special District Water Lifting Tool Exhibition in Hebei is a very good format. Widely adopt this format and various other forms to learn and impart knowledge to each other, so that the technological reforms and inventions of one region and one unit can blossom and bear fruit everywhere.
    Of course, this movement is still in the process of "quantitative change," and many people even look down on these small reforms, thinking that they are isolated, accidental, static, and insignificant small things. In fact, China's agricultural production is still backward, and it is impossible to fully modernize, mechanize, or electrify in a very short period of time. However, people must see that this tool reform is happening after a great social revolution. It is a seedling that was born in the fertile soil of the collective ownership of the means of production and under the warm sunshine

    农业技术革命的萌芽
    随着全国工农业生产大跃进的形势的发展，目前在各地农村中已经出现了群众性的改革生产工具的运动。车子代替了挑子，空中运土机和木架活动打夯机、土起重机、水车运土机等等都出现了。河南内黄县用新式锥代替旧式锥打井下泉，工效提高七十九倍多。许多新式提水工具，包括自动水车，风力水车，水轮泵，在许多省份创造出来了。铡草机和间苗锄苗的机械也在创制。全国已经创造和改制了上千种的新工具和新机械。这是我国社会主义建设中具有伟大意义的事情。
    由于广大农民生产热情的空前高涨，去冬今春在各地农村中兴起了大规模的以兴修水利和积肥为中心的农业生产的高潮，取得了巨大的成绩，全国已经增加了两亿多亩的灌溉面积和一千多亿担的肥料。这个生产高潮还在继续向前发展。在这个高潮中，我们不能单靠群众的热情，不能单靠劳动强度的提高，而必须有各种具体的措施，特别是要进行技术改革，才能够更有保证地实现生产的大跃进。改革生产工具的群众性运动的重大作用恰恰就在这里。
    这个运动发生在直接从事农田水利建设的农民群众中。创造者多半是农民，是农民中间的木匠和铁匠，是成千上万的普通劳动者。研究和试验的活动就在田野间、河沟里和山坡上进行。这些劳动者改革旧工具和创造新工具的直接动机，一是节省和减轻繁重的人力劳动；二是提高劳动的效率，加快工程进度和农事活动进度；三是省钱省工料，以当地能够找到的材料代替缺乏的材料（如以木筒代铁筒）。他们创造的新工具，在不同程度上达到了这些目的。工作效率有的提高了好几倍，高的达到几十倍。成本则降低一半甚至降低百分之九十几。从前只有很少数农业社采用的东西，现在大多数农业社都采用了。
    很明显，这一运动的发展，将使农业基本建设和整个农业生产发展的速度大大加快。农村中因为各方面生产大跃进而发生的劳力不足的困难，将从这里找到克服的办法。
    现在的条件十分有利于这个运动的发展。因为我国以生产资料公有制为主要标志的社会主义生产关系，能够推动社会生产力加速发展。我国农业生产的合作化，使亿万农民从朝不保夕的小农经济的牢笼里解放出来，投入了大规模的集体劳动和生产。这时候，他们不再需要为自己的一小片耕地的命运而忧虑了。他们的精力和智慧现在集中在一点上，就是如何把农业合作社这个集体的生产迅速地发展起来。大规模的生产迫切需要效率高的生产工具，于是生产者们的聪明才智就集中到生产工具的改革上来，这是很自然的。加上目前我们的党和国家机关工作人员，经过整风，普遍地改变了工作方法和思想作风，走出了办公室，深入到广大群众的革命实践和生产实践中去。他们了解了群众的要求和愿望，学习了群众的生产斗争知识和经验；同时也给了广大群众以积极的鼓舞和支持，使群众中一切好的创造能够克服保守思想的阻挠和物质条件的困难而取得胜利。这就给运动的迅速发展扫清了道路。现在这一运动仍在汹涌向前，新的工具正在继续不断地涌现。
    但是，目前有些地方，工具改革运动还缺乏领导。有些领导工作人员还不知道怎样去把已经解放了的生产力，把亿万农民的高度创造性、积极性和集体的智慧进一步发挥出来。他们还没有系统地总结农民和手工业工人对于改良生产工具的丰富经验，并且在这个基础上加以提高。因此，现在还应该进一步提倡全国各个地区、各个部门的全面协作，提倡各地普遍进行相互参观和展览。如河北沧县专区提水工具展览会就是很好的形式。广泛地采用这种形式和其他各种各样的形式，相互学习和传授，使一个地区、一个单位的技术改革和发明创造，遍地开花结果。
    当然现在这一运动还处在“量变”的过程中，有许多人甚至还看不起这些细小的改革，以为它们是一些孤立的、偶然的、静止的和不值得重视的小事。事实上，我国农业生产现在也还是落后的，而且不可能在很短期间完全现代化，机械化或电气化。但是，人们却必须看到，这种工具改革是发生在社会大革命之后。它是在生产资料集体所有制的肥沃土壤上和人民民主专政的温暖阳光下出生的嫩芽，它有极其旺盛的生机和足以冲破一切困难的强大生命力。这是数亿摆脱了私有制锁链的农民要求建立社会主义新农村和加速发展农业生产的强烈愿望的结晶。在这样的基础上发生的工具改革运动，它的发展前途和归趋必然是一个新的农业技术的革命。
    这些缺少近代科学知识和技术的大老粗难道能制造拖拉机和康拜因么？是的，现在还不能：没有足够的技术，也没有足够的钢铁和动力工业。但是，第一、大老粗经过实践中的学习，钻研，将发展成为具有专门科学技术和知识的红色专家。革命的知识分子和科学工作者将与大老粗互相取长补短，共同前进。他们的前进速度将会是很快的。河南内黄县打井下泉用的提高工效七十九倍多的新锥，创造人陈法田是毫城乡岸上农业社的一个生产队长。他经过刻苦的钻研解决了很复杂的技术问题，使全县打井下泉和水利化的进程缩短了。中共内黄县委委员李恒才原来也不是什么专家，他只是想要保证井内有充足的水源。他一面与群众一道实践，一面学习先进经验和地下水文学，学会计算地下土层含水量。他所发现的苇砾泉，百分之百都是成品，出水量很大。这些普普通通的人，只要长期努力下去，他们就能够成为名副其实的专家。第二、钢铁与动力工业不足也是暂时的现象。一旦这些工业增长到了一定的程度，与我国工具改革运动相结合，就会出现我国农业机械化的新时代。
    我们希望全国各个地区的党政领导机关，都要重视和抓紧领导这个生产工具的改革运动。在多快好省的原则下，各省、各专区、各县、各区、各乡都应该因地制宜，就地取材，更多地创造和改制比较进步的工具，去代替比较落后的工具。各个城市的机器工业和手工业应该积极支持农业，供给农村以足够的新式生产工具，帮助农民改制和创造各种工具。总之，各级党政领导机关应当无例外地努力领导这个运动，使它更有组织、更有计划地向前发展。
