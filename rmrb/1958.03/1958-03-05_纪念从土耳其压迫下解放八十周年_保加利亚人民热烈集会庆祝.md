Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 3rd: March 3rd is the eightieth anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation from Turkish oppression according to the treaty signed between Russia and Turkey on March 3rd, 1878. The National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, the National Committee of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association, the Sofia City Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and the Sofia City People's Council held a grand commemorative meeting at the People's Theatre in Sofia tonight.

Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, R. Damyanov, Ganev, Mikhailov and others attended the meeting. Also present were the Soviet government representative, the chairman of the Soviet Slavic Committee, Gundorov, and diplomatic envoys from some countries stationed in Sofia.

Staikov, Chairman of the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and member of the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized: Eighty years ago, the Russian people liberated the Bulgarian people from long-term Turkish oppression at the cost of 200,000 lives. The friendship between the Bulgarian and Russian people is deeply rooted. The establishment of socialist Soviet Union has established this friendship on a new basis and has gained even greater significance. Bulgarian-Soviet friendship is the driving force for Bulgaria's socialist development.

Staikov said that the Bulgarian Communist Party has always waged the most ruthless struggle against Greater Bulgarian chauvinism and bourgeois nationalism in the past and now. Under no circumstances should we neglect to educate young people and the masses of the people in the spirit of socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

Afterwards, Soviet government representative Gundorov spoke. He extended warm congratulations to the conference on behalf of the Soviet government.

The meeting finally passed a telegram to the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. Since late February, people from all walks of life across Bulgaria have held extensive gatherings to warmly celebrate this festival. The Bulgarian Journalists Association also published a commemorative special issue "1878" today. Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov pointed out in an article published in the special issue: The historical ties and sacred friendship between the Bulgarian and Soviet peoples are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and no force can destroy it.

    纪念从土耳其压迫下解放八十周年
    保加利亚人民热烈集会庆祝
    新华社索非亚3日电　3日是保加利亚根据1878年3月3日俄国和土耳其签订的和约从土耳其压迫下解放八十周年纪念日。保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会、保苏友好协会全国委员会、保加利亚共产党索非亚市委员会和市人民会议今晚在索非亚人民剧院举行了盛大纪念会。
    保加利亚党政领导人日夫科夫、拉·达米扬诺夫、加?夫、米哈伊洛夫等出席了会议。出席会议的还有苏联政府代表、苏联斯拉夫委员会主席冈多罗夫，以及一些国家驻索非亚的外交使节。
    保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会主席、保共中央政治局委员斯塔伊科夫在会上讲了话。他强调指出：八十年前，俄国人民以二十万牺牲者的代价把保加利亚人民从土耳其长期压迫下解放出来。保俄人民之间的友谊是根深蒂固的。社会主义的苏联的建立使这一友谊建立在新的基础上，并且获得了更加巨大的意义。保苏友谊是保加利亚社会主义发展的动力。
    斯塔伊科夫说，保加利亚共产党过去和现在都始终进行最无情的斗争，来反对大保加利亚沙文主义和资产阶级民族主义。无论如何都不应该忽视以社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神来教育青年和人民群众。
    接着，苏联政府代表冈多罗夫讲了话。他代表苏联政府向大会热烈祝贺。
    会议最后通过了致苏共中央和苏联部长会议的电报。从2月下旬以来，保加利亚全国各地各阶层人民广泛举行集会，热烈庆祝这一节日。保加利亚新闻工作者协会今天还出版了纪念专刊“一八七八年”。保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫在专刊上发表文章指出：保苏人民的历史联系和神圣友谊已深入人心，任何力量也不能破坏它。
