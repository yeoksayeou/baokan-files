Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: TASS announced on February 28th the "Outline of the Report on Further Developing the Collective Farm System and Reorganizing Machine Tractor Stations" to be delivered by Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the Soviet Supreme Soviet session, for nationwide discussion.

The first part of the outline is a basic summary of the development of Soviet agriculture. The outline states that the Soviet state is advancing along a path of vigorous economic and cultural growth, flourishing science and technology, and continuous improvement of people's welfare. Socialist industry, especially heavy industry, is developing by leaps and bounds. The recently implemented reorganization of industrial and construction management is a new stage in the development of Soviet industry and the entire national economy. Thanks to the resolute implementation of many important measures formulated by the Communist Party, Soviet socialist agriculture has overcome its past backwardness in a short period and achieved great successes.

	Machine Tractor Stations Completed Their Historical Mission

The outline emphasizes that the strength of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies in its adherence to Marxist-Leninist theory, its ability to find the main link at every new stage of historical development; grasping this link enables it to successfully solve the most important tasks of advancing the country along the road to communism. At the current stage of Soviet development, in terms of economic construction, along with the reorganization of industrial management, the most significant and urgent task of the national economy of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations has been brought to the forefront. The practice of collective farm construction and the necessity to open up broader prospects for the development of agricultural productivity and to produce abundant agricultural products for the country urgently raise this task.

The second part of the outline discusses the role of machine tractor stations in establishing and consolidating the collective farm system. The outline points out that machine tractor stations played a significant role in the struggle for the socialist transformation of the countryside and for strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. On the one hand, they provided organizational, economic, and technical leadership to the collective farms, and on the other hand, they helped the Party educate the cadres and all members of the collective farms in the spirit of first fulfilling their obligations to the country and treating labor and public property with a socialist attitude. Machine tractor stations became a force to ensure the victory and development of collective farms, consolidate new forms of socialist labor and production organization, and train cadres capable of promoting large-scale economy. This created prerequisites for a more vigorous development of rural productive forces. The outline also states that the establishment of machine tractor stations marked an extremely profound technological revolution in agriculture, promoted the further development of the rural cultural revolution, and at the same time was a decisive step in the establishment and consolidation of the collective farm system.

	Characteristics of the New Stage of the Collective Farm System

The third part of the outline discusses the new stage of collective farm development and the necessity of reorganizing machine tractor stations.

The outline states that the nationwide struggle launched after the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to realize the Party's plan for a great leap forward in agriculture marks the beginning of a new stage in the development of the collective farm system. This stage has the following characteristics: First, most collective farms have now become large-scale and economically strong farms, widely adopting modern technology, scientific achievements, and advanced experience in production. Second, after the mergers and expansions in 1950 and 1951, collective farms are currently better equipped technically than in the past. Third, countless skilled cadres have grown up in collective farms, all of whom are good at using modern technology and scientific achievements. Fourth, due to the various measures taken by the Party in developing the collective farm economy, the income of collective farms has increased, and the material welfare of collective farm members has also improved.

The outline states that today's collective farms have millions of rubles in income, possess large amounts of reserve funds and production funds, and have numerous cadres. They are incomparable to the economically weak and mostly small collective farms of the early days of collective farm development. Currently, collective farms are capable of making large investments in production, purchasing complex technical equipment, and ensuring the correct use of this equipment. Therefore, the issue of fundamentally changing the forms of production and technical services for collective farms has matured.

The outline continues by saying that in many regions of our country, especially in grain-producing areas, machine tractor stations perform the vast majority of cultivation work for collective farms. Therefore, the main productive force of agriculture (the labor force of collective farms) is separated from the main means of production—tractors and other machines—thus hindering the most effective use of labor and technical equipment. The current practice is practically equivalent to having two masters on one piece of land (the collective farm and the machine tractor station). Because complex technical equipment is in the hands of the machine tractor stations, the collective farms cannot directly control and use these machines to fully unleash the entire potential of collective farm production. Collective farms and machine tractor stations have to maintain two management organizations to accomplish the same tasks, which greatly increases the cost of agricultural products.

Therefore, due to the development and consolidation of collective farms, many regions in our country have begun to explore new forms of relationships between machine tractor stations and collective farms. This situation shows that machine tractor stations have completed the tasks they previously undertook, and now need to be reorganized.

	Providing Production and Technical Services to Collective Farms in New Forms

The outline states that previously, machine tractor stations played the role of organizers of collective farm production. This role is now disappearing because collective farms have accumulated rich experience in organizing and managing large public economies. In the absence of their own technical cadres, machine tractor stations were the centers of agricultural technological progress. Now, collective farms have a large number of cadres, who are also propagators of technological progress. Therefore, this role of machine tractor stations is also disappearing. Currently, machine tractor stations no longer play the kind of political role they shouldered in the first stage of collective farm construction. Machine tractor station workers no longer need to tell everyone about the superiority of large collective economies, because the collective farm system has long been victorious in our country. This role of machine tractor stations has also disappeared.

It can be seen from this that the socio-economic conditions in the countryside have fundamentally changed in the process of building socialist agriculture and consolidating collective farms. Now, collective farms are developed socialist enterprises, and most of them no longer need the leadership of machine tractor stations. Therefore, the existing form of providing production and technical services to collective farms through machine tractor stations can no longer meet the needs of collective farm production development and has begun to hinder the development of agricultural productive forces. Therefore, it is necessary to find new forms of production and technical services for collective farms that are more in line with the current level of collective farm system development.

The outline states that in order to further develop and consolidate the collective farm system, further expand agricultural production, it is appropriate to sell tractors, combines, and other agricultural machines directly to collective farms. The reorganization of machine tractor stations and the sale of machinery and equipment to collective farms will open up broader prospects for the development of agricultural productivity, increase the material interest, initiative, and enthusiasm of collective farmers, and strive to better utilize all the potential and possibilities of collective farm production. This will promote the further organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms as socialist enterprises, spark a new upsurge in the economy, and improve the welfare of collective farm members.

The outline states that some individual economists suggested several years ago that the existing machines of machine tractor stations should be completely sold to collective farms, thereby abolishing machine tractor stations. This erroneous suggestion, which would only be dangerous to socialist agriculture, was resolutely refuted by the Party. When collective farms were mostly small and economically weak, they were unable to purchase and correctly use the technical equipment of machine tractor stations. If machine tractor stations were abolished, it would inevitably weaken the collective farm economy and undermine the collective farm system.

The current preparation to reorganize machine tractor stations and transition to new and more improved forms of production and technical services for collective farms has been prepared by the entire development process of socialist agriculture in recent years. This reorganization will be carried out on the basis of the great victories achieved by the collective farm system with the help of machine tractor stations.

This is the condition and the basis on which the Party now proposes the issue of selling tractors and other agricultural machinery to collective farms. This issue does not arise from the weakness of the collective farm system, but from the strength of the collective farm system. The fundamental difference between the current proposal to sell technical equipment to collective farms and the suggestions made by individual economists a few years ago lies here. At the same time, this does not mean abolishing machine tractor stations, but gradually implementing reorganization in order to better assist collective farms in production and technology according to the characteristics of each region and the level of economic development of each collective farm.

The outline points out that the transition of collective farms from obtaining production technical assistance through machine tractor stations to purchasing tractors and other machinery is an extremely important stage in the construction of socialist agriculture and the consolidation and further development of the collective farm system. Now is the time, under the leadership of the working class headed by the Communist Party and the dominance of socialist relations of production, to concentrate the land, which belongs to the state but is permanently allocated to the collective farms, and the machines in the hands of the same owner.

The outline states that reorganizing machine tractor stations is raising the leadership of agriculture to a higher level. In the past, the state led collective farms through machine tractor stations, but now the state will directly promote the development of collective farm production by supplying tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines. Machine tractor stations will be gradually reorganized into technical repair stations according to the specific conditions of various regions, responsible for repairing the complex technical equipment of collective farms, supplying (through sales) collective farms with new technologies, spare parts, fuels, fertilizers, etc., and renting machines that collective farms do not have.

When implementing the measure of selling technical equipment to collective farms and reorganizing machine tractor stations, all localities must fully consider local conditions and the characteristics of various regions and collective farms to determine the time limit for implementing this measure, and must not mechanically copy, coerce, or act rashly.

The outline continues by saying that implementing measures to further develop the collective farm system and reorganize machine tractor stations will further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, more closely unite all working people, consolidate the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, and promote the growth of the Soviet state's strength.

	Ownership by the Whole People and Cooperative Ownership Both Serve Communist Construction

The outline points out that some comrades, mainly economists, believe that due to the reorganization of machine tractor stations, vague concepts will arise on certain theoretical issues, such as the issue of two forms of ownership. They proceed from the premise that the transition to communism requires full efforts to strengthen ownership by the whole people and raise collective farm-cooperative ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people. They worry that selling machines to collective farms will weaken ownership by the whole people. Some have also raised the question of which form of socialist agriculture is more advanced—the collective farm system or the state farm system? Some comrades have such ideas: should collective farms be transformed into state farm economic forms?

This formulation is essentially wrong. It is true that ownership by the whole people is the highest form of ownership. This is how Lenin understood it. However, Lenin never opposed ownership by the whole people to cooperative ownership. On the contrary, he emphasized that both forms of ownership are socialist ownership, and both forms of ownership serve the interests of the people and the goal of building a communist society.

The difference is only that one is ownership by the whole people with a higher level of public ownership, and the other is collective farm ownership with a lower level of public ownership. That is to say, the issue is to gradually raise the level of public ownership of collective farm ownership, thereby raising them to the level of ownership by the whole people. This can only be achieved by further efforts to consolidate state ownership and collective farm ownership.

Therefore, it is clear that there is no need to fear the strengthening of collective farm ownership. If one form of socialist ownership is opposed to another, if it is insisted that the strengthening of collective farm ownership will weaken ownership by the whole people, it will always lead to absurdity. These types of views cannot be considered correct. Because the Soviet people are deeply concerned about the further development of collective farms and the rise of their economies, concerned about collective farms expanding production and increasing wealth for the benefit of society. The rise of agriculture lies first and foremost in the strengthening of collective farm ownership and the consolidation of collective farm reserve funds. Cooperative ownership does not contradict our theoretical principles regarding the path to building a communist society, because the path to communism is to be achieved through the strengthening of ownership by the whole people and collective farm ownership.

It cannot be denied that those who fear the consolidation of collective farm ownership are looking at this ownership with the old eyes of the early days of collective farm construction. They have forgotten that today's collective farm ownership is different from twenty-five to thirty years ago, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The outline states that in realizing the communist construction plan, the Party and the government have never regarded collective farms as foreign bodies in the socialist organism, but have always regarded them as extremely important components of the socialist economic system.

	Collective Farm Reserve Funds Are Close to Ownership by the Whole People

The relationship between the socialist state and collective farms is different from the urban-rural relationship in capitalist society. It has never been built on the basis of purely commercial interests. The expenses incurred by machine tractor stations for working for collective farms are much greater than the income the state receives from this work. Collective farm members correctly believe that the wealth of each collective farm is created with the decisive assistance of the state, and this wealth essentially belongs to all the people. Therefore, the wealth of collective farms is created by the people. Under the current conditions, the collective farm's public accumulation is essentially close to being owned by the whole people, and increasing this accumulation is primarily a concern for collective farmers. This is in line with their fundamental interests. The more public accumulation there is, the more machinery the collective farms will have, labor will be more mechanized, the work of collective farm members will be easier, labor productivity will be higher, and the public economy will develop faster. The labor of collective farm members based on the widespread use of modern technology will be similar in nature to the labor of industrial workers.

In the Soviet state, ownership by the whole people is constantly developing, and the production of industry and state farms is increasing significantly. Currently, strengthening collective farm ownership and selling machinery to collective farms will not bring about any substantial changes in the interrelationship between the two socialist ownerships. Selling machinery to collective farms will create conditions for a more coordinated development of various sectors of the national economy.

The outline states that the task we face is, in addition to developing ownership by the whole people, to also develop and consolidate collective farm ownership. This is in line with the interests of the people and the interests of communist construction. In the future, as the public wealth of collective farms grows, collective farm ownership will rise to the level of ownership by the whole people. The more rapidly we develop the productive forces of socialist agriculture, the sooner the day will come when the differences between ownership by the whole people and collective farm ownership will actually disappear. The sale of machine tractor station machinery to collective farms should be viewed from this perspective and should be seen as a measure to consolidate collective farm ownership for the benefit of the people.

	State Farms and Collective Farms Should Not Be Opposed to Each Other

It is clear from the above that not only should collective farm ownership not be opposed to ownership by the whole people, but also the two socialist enterprises in agriculture—collective farms and state farms—should not be opposed to each other. State farms are state-owned enterprises with a higher level of production organization. Recent experience has shown that state farms have better conditions for expanding agricultural production. They are the main form of management when reclaiming virgin and idle land. State farms produce cheaper grain and some other products for the state. State farms will continue to be models for collective farms in the future, setting an example of a more perfect and highly leveled agricultural production for them.

The fourth part of the outline discusses the conditions for selling technical equipment to collective farms and several issues in the procurement of agricultural products, and the fifth part discusses the tasks of party organizations and soviet organs in reorganizing machine tractor stations.

The outline pointed out that from 1958 onwards, new tractors and agricultural machinery must be sold to collective farms. The Party committees and Soviet executive committees of the states, and the Party committees and Soviet executive committees of the border regions should formulate specific measures for selling tractors and other machinery to collective farms in their states and border regions, based on general principles and taking into account the characteristics that are of great significance to the region. These plans should be studied by the Central Committees and Councils of Ministers of the various Union republics.

Regarding the future procurement of agricultural products, the outline pointed out that up to now, the state has obtained agricultural products from collective farms in the form of in-kind remuneration for the work of machine tractor stations. In the future, the state will directly obtain agricultural products from collective farms by selling commodities such as machinery, spare parts, fuels, fertilizers, etc. In this regard, the amount of agricultural products obtained by the state will not decrease but will increase.

If procurement work is organized rationally under the new conditions, the state will definitely be able to obtain the necessary amount of agricultural products in a timely manner.

Regarding the tasks of party organizations and soviet organs in reorganizing machine tractor stations, the outline pointed out that they should deeply study the situation in each region to determine the appropriate timing for implementing these measures, directly lead collective farms that own tractors and agricultural machinery, and practically help these farms reorganize their work.

The sense of responsibility of all communists should be raised, so that they are more concerned about the situation of collective farms, more concerned about further developing their economy, and more concerned about farms fulfilling their obligations to the state in a timely and comprehensive manner.

Finally, the Central Committee of the CPSU called on the Soviet people to actively participate in the discussion and study of the proposals on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations, in order to find the most correct way to solve this problem, which is of great significance for the successful realization of the tasks of communist construction.

    给农业生产力的发展开辟更广阔的天地
    赫鲁晓夫同志“关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的报告提纲摘要
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社2月28日发表了苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志将在苏联最高苏维埃会议上作的“关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的报告提纲，以供全民讨论。
    提纲的第一部分是关于苏联农业发展的基本总结。提纲说，苏维埃国家正沿着经济和文化蓬勃高涨、科学和技术繁荣昌盛、人民福利不断增长的道路前进。社会主义工业，首先是重工业正在突飞猛进地发展着。最近实现的工业和建筑业管理的改组，是苏联工业和整个国民经济发展的新阶段。由于坚决地贯彻了共产党所制定的许多重要措施，苏联的社会主义农业在短时间内克服了过去的落后状态并取得了巨大的成就。
        机器拖拉机站完成了历史任务
    提纲着重指出，苏联共产党的力量在于，它遵循马克思列宁主义理论，在每一个新的历史发展阶段善于找到主要的环节；抓住了这个环节就能够成功地解决使国家沿着共产主义道路前进的最重要的任务。在苏联发展的现阶段，在经济建设方面，随着工业管理的改组，进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站这个最重大和刻不容缓的国民经济任务就被提到了首要地位。集体农庄建设的实践以及必须给农业生产力的发展开辟更加广阔的天地、必须给国家生产丰足的农产品这一情况，迫切地提出了这个任务。
    提纲的第二部分谈的是机器拖拉机站在建立和巩固集体农庄制度方面的作用。提纲指出，机器拖拉机站在争取农村的社会主义改造和争取加强工农联盟的斗争中起了莫大的作用。它们一方面对集体农庄实行组织上、经济上和技术上的领导，一方面帮助党用首先完成对国家的义务的精神，用以社会主义态度对待劳动和公共财产的精神教育了集体农庄的干部和全体庄员。机器拖拉机站成了一股力量，用以保证集体农庄的胜利和发展，巩固社会主义劳动和生产组织的新形式，培养能够推动大规模的经济的干部。这样就为农村生产力的更加蓬勃的发展创造了先决条件。提纲还说，机器拖拉机站的建立标志着农业中的极其深刻的技术革命，促进了农村文化革命的进一步开展，并且同时是集体农庄制度建立和巩固的决定性步骤。
        集体农庄制度的新阶段的特点
    提纲的第三部分谈的是集体农庄发展的新阶段和改组机器拖拉机站的必要性。
    提纲说，苏联共产党中央9月全会之后为实现共产党制定的农业大跃进计划而展开的全民斗争，标志着在集体农庄制度发展中的新阶段的开端。这个阶段有以下的特点：第一，现在大部分集体农庄都成了规模巨大的和经济雄厚的农场，在进行生产时都广泛地采用现代化的技术以及科学成就和先进经验。第二，经过1950年到1951年的合并扩大以后，目前集体农庄在技术装备上要比过去好得多。第三，集体农庄中有无数熟练干部成长起来了，他们都善于利用现代技术和科学成就。第四，由于党在发展集体农庄经济方面采取了各种措施，集体农庄的收入增长了，集体农庄庄员的物质福利也提高了。
    提纲说，现在的集体农庄有数百万收入，拥有大量公积金和生产基金、人数众多的干部，它们同集体农庄发展初期的经济上软弱的、多半是小型的集体农庄不可同日而语。目前集体农庄有能力对生产进行大量投资，购置复杂的技术设备，保证正确地使用这些设备，因而根本改变对集体农庄的生产和技术服务形式的问题已经成熟了。
    提纲接着说，在我国很多地区，首先是谷物区，机器拖拉机站替集体农庄进行绝大部分耕耘工作。因此，农业的主要生产力（集体农庄的劳动力）就脱离了主要生产工具——拖拉机和其他机器，从而妨碍了劳动力和技术设备的最有效的利用。现在的做法实际上等于一块土地上有两个主人（集体农庄和机器拖拉机站）。由于复杂的技术设备掌握在机器拖拉机站的手中，集体农庄就无法直接支配和使用这些设备来最充分地发挥集体农庄生产的全部潜力。集体农庄和机器拖拉机站不得不维持两个管理机构来完成同样的任务，这就大大地提高了农产品的成本。
    因此，由于集体农庄的发展和巩固，我国很多地区开始探寻机器拖拉机站同集体农庄关系的新形式。这种情况说明，机器拖拉机站已经完成了它们从前所担负的任务，现在需要进行改组。
    用新的形式为集体农庄进行生产技术服务
    提纲说，以前机器拖拉机站起了集体农庄生产组织者的作用。现在这种作用正在消失，因为集体农庄已经积累了组织和经营大公有经济的丰富经验。在集体农庄没有自己技术干部的情况下，机器拖拉机站是农业技术进步的中心。现在，集体农庄已经拥有众多的干部，他们也是技术进步的传播者。因此，机器拖拉机站的这种作用也在消失。现在，机器拖拉机站已经不再起它在集体农庄建设的第一阶段所肩负的那种政治作用。机器拖拉机站工作人员现在已经用不着逢人就讲大集体经济的优越性，因为集体农庄制度在我国早就胜利了。机器拖拉机站的这种作用也消失了。
    由此可见，在建设社会主义农业和巩固集体农庄的过程中，农村的社会经济情况已经根本改变。现在，集体农庄是发达的社会主义企业，它们大多数已经不需要机器拖拉机站领导。因此，现有的通过机器拖拉机站来对集体农庄进行生产技术服务的形式已经不能满足集体农庄生产发展的需求，并且开始阻碍农业生产力的发展。因此，必须找寻更符合现阶段集体农庄制度发展水平的新的形式来对集体农庄进行生产技术服务。
    提纲说，为了进一步发展和巩固集体农庄制度，进一步扩大农业生产，把拖拉机、联合机和其他农业机器直接卖给集体农庄是适宜的。机器拖拉机站的改组、把机器设备卖给集体农庄，将会给农业生产力的发展开辟更广阔的天地，将会提高集体农民的物质兴趣、创造主动性和积极性，为更好地利用集体农庄生产的一切潜力和可能而斗争。这将会促使作为社会主义企业的集体农庄在组织上和经济上的进一步巩固，引起经济的新高潮，增进集体农庄庄员的福利。
    提纲说，个别经济学家在几年以前就建议把机器拖拉机站现有的机器完全卖给集体农庄，从而取消机器拖拉机站。这种错误的、对于社会主义农业只会有危险的建议遭到了党的坚决驳斥。当集体农庄多半是小型的和经济上软弱的情况下，它们无力购买和正确地使用机器拖拉机站的技术设备。如果取消机器拖拉机站就必然会削弱集体农庄的经济和破坏集体农庄制度。
    目前准备改组机器拖拉机站并且在为集体农庄进行生产和技术服务上过渡到新的、更为完善的形式，这是近年来社会主义农业的整个发展进程准备好了的。这次改组将在集体农庄制度由于机器拖拉机站的帮助而取得巨大胜利的基础上进行。
    这就是党现在提出把拖拉机和其他农业机器卖给集体农庄这个问题的条件和所依据的基础。这个问题不是出于集体农庄制度的软弱，而是出于集体农庄制度的强大。目前提出向集体农庄出卖技术设备的问题同几年前个别经济学家所提出的建议的根本区别就在这里。同时这里所说的并不是要取消机器拖拉机站，而是逐步实行改组，以便根据各个地区的特点和各个集体农庄经济发展的水平更好地对集体农庄进行生产和技术帮助。
    提纲指出，集体农庄由通过机器拖拉机站获得生产技术帮助过渡到购买拖拉机和其他机器，这是建设社会主义农业以及巩固和进一步发展集体农庄制度中的极端重要的阶段。现在是，在以共产党为首的工人阶级起领导作用和社会主义生产关系占统治地位的情况下，把属于国家的、但永远交给集体农庄使用的土地以及机器都集中在同一个主人的手中了。
    提纲说，改组机器拖拉机站是把对农业的领导提高到更高的水平。过去国家是通过机器拖拉机站领导集体农庄，而现在国家将通过供应拖拉机、收割联合机和其他机器直接促进集体农庄生产的发展。机器拖拉机站将根据各种地区的具体条件逐渐改组为技术修理站，负责修理集体农庄的复杂技术设备、供应（通过出售的办法）集体农庄以新技术、备件、燃料、肥料等，以及出租集体农庄所没有的机器。
    在实行把技术设备卖给集体农庄和改组机器拖拉机站这个措施的时候，各地必须全面地考虑当地的条件和各种不同地区和集体农庄的特点来确定实行这个措施的期限，决不能生搬硬套、强迫命令和仓卒从事。
    提纲接着说，贯彻进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施将更加巩固工农联盟，更加紧密地团结全体劳动人民、巩固苏维埃社会牢不可破的精神上和政治上的团结，将促进苏维埃国家实力的增长。
      全民所有制和合作社所有制同样
            为共产主义建设服务
    提纲指出，有个别同志，主要是经济学家认为，由于机器拖拉机站的改组，在某些理论问题上，如在关于两种所有制形式的问题上，将会产生模糊的观念。他们从这样一个前提出发：向共产主义过渡需要全力加强全民所有制，把集体农庄——合作社所有制提高到全民所有制的水平。他们担心：向集体农庄出售机器是否会削弱全民所有制。有人还提出了这样的问题：怎样的社会主义农业形式比较先进——是集体农庄制度呢，还是国营农场制度？个别同志有这种想法：是否应当把集体农庄转变为国营农场经济形式？
    这种提法实质上是错误的。诚然，全民所有制是最高形式的所有制。列宁就是这样理解的。但是，列宁从来也没有把全民所有制同合作社所有制对立起来。相反地，他强调指出，这两种形式的所有制都是社会主义所有制，这两种形式的所有制都是为人民的利益服务，为建成共产主义社会的目标服务的。
    差别不过是：一个是具有较高公有化水平的全民所有制，另一个是具有较低公有化水平的集体农庄所有制。这就是说，问题是要逐渐提高集体农庄所有制的公有化水平，从而把它们提高到全民所有制的水平。只有进一步努力巩固国家所有制和集体农庄所有制才能做到这一点。
    因此很明显，不应该害怕集体农庄所有制的加强。如果把社会主义所有制的一个形式同另一个形式对立起来，如果硬说集体农庄所有制的加强就会削弱全民所有制，那就要一直弄到荒谬的程度。不能认为这一类观点是正确的。因为苏联人民深切关心集体农庄的进一步发展和它们经济的高涨，关心集体农庄扩大生产和增加财富，以利于社会。农业的高涨首先在于集体农庄所有制的加强和集体农庄公积金的巩固。合作社所有制同我们的关于建设共产主义社会的道路的理论原则并不矛盾，因为走向共产主义的道路是要通过全民所有制和集体农庄所有制的加强。
    不能不指出，那些害怕集体农庄所有制巩固的人是用集体农庄建设初期的老眼光来看待这种所有制的，他们忘记了，现在的集体农庄所有制无论在数量上或质量上都不同于二十五——三十年以前。
    提纲说，党和政府在实现共产主义建设计划时，从不认为集体农庄是社会主义机体中的异体，而是向来把它们看作社会主义经济制度极为重要的组成部分。
      集体农庄的公积金已近乎全民所有
    社会主义国家和集体农庄的关系不同于资本主义社会的城乡关系，它从来不是建筑在纯商业利益的基础上的。机器拖拉机站为集体农庄工作而付出的开支，要比国家从这一工作中获得的收入多得多。集体农庄庄员正确地认为，每个集体农庄的财富是在国家的决定性的帮助下造成的，这笔财富在实质上是属于全体人民的。因此，集体农庄的财富是由人民创造的。在当前的条件下，集体农庄的公积金实质上已近乎全民所有，增加公积金首先是集体农民所关心的事。这是符合他们的根本利益的。公积金越多，集体农庄的机器也就越多，劳动将更加机械化，集体农庄庄员的工作将更轻便，劳动生产率将越高，公有经济将发展得更快。以广泛采用现代化技术为基础的集体农庄庄员的劳动在性质上将接近产业工人的劳动。
    在苏维埃国家里，全民所有制不断发展，工业和国营农场的生产大量增加，目前加强集体农庄所有制，卖机器给集体农庄不会使两种社会主义所有制的相互关系有任何实质上的改变。卖机器给集体农庄将为国民经济各部门更加协调地发展创造条件。
    提纲说，我们面临的任务是，除了发展全民所有制而外，还要发展和巩固集体农庄所有制。这是符合人民的利益和共产主义建设的利益的。将来，随着集体农庄公共财富的增长，集体农庄所有制将提高到全民所有制水平。我们越是迅速地发展社会主义农业的生产力，全民所有制和集体农庄所有制之间的差别实际消失的日子也就会越快地到来。把机器拖拉机站的机器卖给集体农庄一事正是应该从这样的角度来看，应该把这看做一项为了人民的利益而巩固集体农庄所有制的措施。
      不应把国营农场和集体农庄对立起来
    从上面所说可以清楚地看到，不但不应该把集体农庄所有制同全民所有制对立起来，而且也不应该把农业中的两种社会主义企业——集体农庄和国营农场相互对立起来。国营农场是具有较高生产组织水平的国营企业。近年来的经验证明，国营农场在扩大农产品生产方面具有更好的条件。它们是开垦生荒地和熟荒地时的主要经营形式。国营农场为国家生产更廉价的粮食和一些其他产品。国营农场今后仍然是集体农庄的模范，为它们树立更完善的、有高度水平的农业生产的榜样。
    提纲的第四部分谈到了把技术装备卖给集体农庄的条件和采购农产品的几个问题，第五部分谈到了党组织和苏维埃机关在改组机器拖拉机站方面的任务。
    提纲指出，自1958年开始，必须把新的拖拉机和农业机器出售给集体农庄。各州党委和苏维埃执行委员会，边疆区党委和苏维埃执行委员会应该根据总的原则，考虑到对本地区有重大意义的特征，为本州和本边疆区制定向集体农庄出售拖拉机和其他机器的具体措施。这些计划应当由各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会和部长会议研究。
    关于今后农产品的采购问题，提纲指出，迄今为止，国家是以机器拖拉机站工作所得到的实物报酬的形式从集体农庄得到农产品的，今后国家将靠出售机器、备件、燃料、肥料等商品直接从集体农庄获得农产品。在这方面，国家所获得的农产品将不是减少，而是要增多。
    如果在新的条件下，合理地组织采购工作，那末国家必定能及时地获得必要数量的农产品。
    关于党组织和苏维埃机关在改组机器拖拉机站方面的任务，提纲指出，它们应该深入研究每一地区的情况，以便确定实现这些措施的适当时机，直接领导那些自备拖拉机和农业机器的集体农庄，实际帮助这些农庄从新组织工作。
    应当提高全体共产党员的责任心，使他们更加关心集体农庄的状况、关心进一步发展它们的经济、关心农庄及时全面完成对国家的义务。
    苏共中央最后号召苏联人民积极参加讨论和研究关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的建议，以便找出一个最正确的办法，来解决这个对顺利实现共产主义建设任务有莫大意义的问题。
