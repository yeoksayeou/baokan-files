    A fifty-kilometer-long cable car track, the longest in Sichuan Province, has begun construction in the northern Sichuan region. This cable car track runs from Hou'ergou on Mount Huarong, which is over 1,000 meters above sea level, to the edge of the Qu River, a total length of fifty kilometers, and will bypass precipitous cliffs and pass through many valleys along the way.
    The cable car track is a type of transportation line constructed according to the inclined terrain. In the past, it cost 24 yuan per ton of coal to be transported by manpower. Changing to cable car transportation will only cost six yuan. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    五十公里的滑车道
    四川省最长的一条滑车道在川北地区开工修建。这条滑车道从拔海一千多公尺的华鎣山猴儿沟到渠河边，全长五十公里，途中要绕过悬岩峭壁，穿过很多山谷。
    滑车道是按照高低倾斜的地势修建的一种运输线路。过去每吨煤用人力运要运费二十四元，改用滑车运输只要六元。（据新华社讯）
