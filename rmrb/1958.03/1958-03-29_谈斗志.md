    On Fighting Spirit
    Tian Lianqian
    Disasters can erode people's fighting spirit, but they can also inspire it. It depends on the ideological foundation of the people who suffer the disasters. Our country has some regions that suffer disasters every year, and some places are in a state of disaster relief every year, but there are still disasters every year. Because they live in disaster for a long time, some people gradually become content with suffering from disasters, and even the hope of living a good life becomes increasingly indifferent. When the development of production is mentioned, they will shake their heads: "There are frequent disasters all year round, so where is the strength to engage in water conservancy!" "Other regions can achieve four, five, and eight, but it is impossible for disaster-stricken areas to do so." According to this statement, the people in the disaster areas can only suffer forever and be slaves to nature forever.
    But there is another kind of people: they resolutely refuse to bow their heads to famine, they are determined to overcome famine and nature, and in the end, they really conquer nature. The comprehensive leap forward in production and construction of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, is a living example. This cooperative has suffered disasters for years. Last autumn, 94% of the cultivated land was flooded, and grain crops were reduced by 85%. It cannot be said that the disaster was not serious. However, in the face of severe famine, they not only dared to put forward the slogans of not going bankrupt, not taking out loans, guaranteeing self-sufficiency, and not relying on the state; but also to turn northern Henan into Jiangnan and the saline-alkali land into a land of fish and rice. In order to overcome nature and eliminate disasters, they came up with and used many positive methods. Finally, they were victorious: in just a few months, they began to change the face of the disaster area, truly achieving no fleeing from famine, no loans, and also repaying old loans, and also taking out money to support brother cooperatives! This was difficult to imagine in the era of small-scale peasant economy. And now, this is just one of many examples.
    Comrades in the armed forces like to say: fighting a war is about fighting a spirit, that is, morale. If the morale is high, they can persevere in the battle under difficult circumstances, turn danger into safety, and turn disadvantages into advantages. If the morale is low, there will be the opposite result. The same is true for a soldier. If he is full of fighting spirit, he can continue to fight and kill the enemy even if he is injured; conversely, if he is in a bad mood, he can also get the opposite result. The people of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative are like armed forces and soldiers with high morale. So they overcame the natural disasters. Is this a bit idealistic? No. Today the government is the people's, the exploitation system has been eliminated, and the scattered small-scale peasant economy has been united into a centralized cooperative economy. These are objective favorable conditions. These objective conditions make it possible to eliminate disasters. As long as people subjectively recognize these favorable conditions and possibilities, make good use of them, and work hard and unremittingly, they will surely be able to achieve miraculous victories like the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative.
    Almost one-tenth of our country's rural population suffers from various natural disasters of varying degrees every year. In order to provide disaster relief, the state allocates large amounts of special funds every year. If the agricultural cooperatives in the disaster areas can do as the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative did, the state can free up a lot of funds to engage in construction. More importantly, the people in the disaster areas can fundamentally no longer suffer from the persecution of disasters and change from slaves of nature to masters of their own destiny.

    谈斗志
    田连阡
    灾难能够消磨人们的斗志，但也能激发人们的斗志。这要看遭受灾难的人们思想基础是什么。我们国家每年总有一些地区受灾，其中有一些地方年年救灾，但仍然年年有灾。因为长期在受灾中过日子，有些人就逐渐变得安于受灾，甚至连过好日子的希望也越来越淡漠了。一提发展生产，他们就会摇头：“常年闹灾，那有力量搞水利！”“别的地区可以实现四、五、八，常年遭灾的地区就不可能。”按照这说法，灾区的人民只有永远受苦受难，永远作自然的奴隶了。
    但是也有另外一种人：他们坚决不向灾荒低头，他们执意要战胜灾荒和自然，而最后他们也就真的征服了自然。河南省封丘县应举农业社生产建设全面大跃进，就是一个活的榜样。这个社连年受灾，去年秋季94％的耕地被水淹，粮食作物减产85％，灾荒不能说不重了。可是，在严重的灾荒面前，他们不但敢于提出不破产，不贷款，保证自给，不依赖国家的口号；而且要把豫北变成江南，把盐碱洼地变成鱼米之乡。为了战胜自然，消灭灾害，他们想出了和使用了许多积极的办法。终于，他们胜利了：在短短几个月当中，就开始改变了灾区的面貌，真正做到了不逃荒，不贷款，而且还了旧贷，还拿出钱来支援了兄弟社！这在小农经济时代是难于想像的事。而现在，这不过是许多例子中间的一个罢了。
    武装部队的同志们喜欢说：打仗是打的一股气，即士气。气盛，就能够在困难局面之下坚持战斗，转危为安，转劣势为优势。气衰，就会有相反的结果。对于一个战士也是一样。他如果斗志昂扬，就受了伤也能继续作战，杀伤敌人；反之，他如果情绪败坏，就也能够得到相反的结果。应举农业社的人们，就像是斗志昂扬的武装部队和战士。所以他们就把自然灾害战胜了。这是不是有点唯心主义呢？不是的。今天政府是人民的，剥削制度消灭了，分散的小农经济联合成了集中的合作化的经济，这都是客观的有利条件。这些客观条件使消灭灾荒成为可能。人们只要主观上认识了这些有利条件和可能，好好地利用它们，努力不懈地做去，他们就一定能够像应举农业社一样取得奇迹般的胜利。
    我们的国家几乎每年都有十分之一左右的农村人口要遭受程度不同的各种自然灾害。为了救灾，国家年年要拨出大宗专款。假如灾区的农业社都能够像应举农业社那样做，国家就可以腾出大量的资金来从事建设。更重要的，是灾区的人民可以根本不再遭受灾荒的迫害，从自然的奴隶变成自己命运的主人。
