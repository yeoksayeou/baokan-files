(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reported: Indonesian Air Force spokesman Suroto announced on the 19th that an Indonesian Air Force fighter squadron annihilated a defeated force of Naim Golan, who had launched riots in Medan, on the 18th. This defeated army, loaded on sixty trucks including eight armored vehicles, fled south from Medan to Bymadan Sinda and Bulapa, attempting to join the rebel group in Central Sumatra.

According to a broadcast from Medan Radio on the evening of the 18th, Brigadier General Jatikusumo, representative of the Army Chief of Staff stationed at the First Military Region Command, the Aceh Defense Zone, and the Medan Third Infantry Regiment, said that no matter where the rebel forces led by former Deputy Chief of Staff of the First Military Region, Naim Golan, and his accomplices fled, the government was determined to send the army and air force to pursue them closely.

The "Indonesia Torch Daily" reported on the 19th that a company from the 131st Battalion, which had defected to the rebels and fled Medan after their defeat, had returned and surrendered to the government army.

The city of Medan has returned to normal. Flights and telecommunications between Jakarta and Medan have resumed from today.

The "East Star Daily" reported on the 19th that documents seized by the government army while pursuing rebels in Medan proved that Naim Golan, the former deputy chief of staff of the First Military Region, and his accomplices, who had been plotting for a long time, originally planned to launch riots in Medan on March 2, but due to the vigilance of the army loyal to the government, most of their conspiracy failed.

The newspaper said that the documents also revealed that some leaders of the Huseini group were planning to flee abroad. According to their plan, they intended to escape to the Philippines and Australia.

Some newspapers in Jakarta revealed on the 19th that the unrest in Medan was directed behind the scenes by Simbolan, the former commander of the First Military Region, who was in Medan when the unrest occurred. The newspapers revealed that the Naim Golan group robbed banks in Medan when they fled, stealing approximately tens of millions of rupiah.

According to an Antara News Agency report from Central Sumatra, as of March 17, no fewer than 400 rebels had surrendered to the government army with weapons in the recently recovered Pekanbaru area.

Life and daily activities in Pekanbaru have returned to normal.
