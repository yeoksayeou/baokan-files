    Portable and Dual-Purpose, Suitable for Both Urban and Rural Areas
    The Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory has successfully trial-produced and begun producing a small, portable radio that can use either DC power (batteries) or AC power (ordinary household electricity).
    This radio is small, has clear sound, high sensitivity, saves electricity, and is easy to use, making it particularly suitable for travel or use in rural areas.
        Stereo Sound, Adjustable High and Low
    The Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory recently successfully trial-produced a Class One radio.
    All the parts used in this radio are domestically produced. It has four bands, stereo sound, beautiful sound quality, high sensitivity, and good selectivity. The radio also features a push-button band switch, movable magnetic antenna, dual-knob tone adjustment, variable bandwidth and other advanced components. This radio can not only adjust high and low tones separately, but also shows the degree of adjustment on a staff on the dial, to suit different listener preferences.
