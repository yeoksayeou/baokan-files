    Newcomers and New Works

    Anyone who has seen the Third National Print Exhibition will have a feeling of "newness." Indeed, in this exhibition, in addition to veteran artists and those who have grown up in recent years, such as Zhao Zongzao, Li Huanmin, Zhuang Yuan, Wu Ran, Mo Ce, and Liang Dong, there are also more than 120 newcomers such as Chen Tianran, Zhao Ruichun, Xiao Gang, and Yang Zheng. It is particularly exciting that there are also artists from the Mongolian, Miao, and Buyi ethnic groups. They have all entered the ranks of printmakers with the finished products of their hard work. This is one aspect of the "new," but the more important aspect is the new life reflected in the works of the printmakers, and the new and original exploration in art.
    How to reflect the cause of industrial and agricultural production and construction is an important topic for printmakers. In this exhibition, the creative level of works praising industrial construction has also been improved compared with the previous exhibition. For example, Zhao Ruichun's "Joint Effort" uses a close-up composition, bright black-and-white contrast, and powerful lines to express the spirit of unity and cooperation among steelworkers in their intense labor, showing the power of the laborers, which leaves a deep impression. Zheng Zhen, in "On the Foziling Man-made Lake," strives to reveal the beauty of nature after it has been transformed by human power. In the picture, the vertical trees in the foreground intersect with the parallel dam; the undulating mountains in the background contrast with the calm lake water; the safe passage of ships and the connection of the reservoir, all kinds of ingenious arrangements and depictions, can make people feel a sense of peace and tranquility. Other works such as "The Last Steel Beam," "Dawn in Zhanjiang," "Shizitan Construction Site," and "Thermal Power Plant Construction" are also relatively successful works. This not only shows the author's passion for the motherland's labor construction, but also shows that China's emerging prints inherit the revolutionary tradition of being closely integrated with the struggle of reality.
    Artistic creation arises from abundant emotion and is conveyed through vivid images, and then infects others through the images. This has been repeatedly proven by many successful works. I remember reading the Soviet novel "Cement," and it was the woodcut illustrations in the book that first attracted me. The printmaker, Mei Fierd, attracted me with his passion for industrial construction. Especially the picture "Waves," which uses bold and unrestrained brushstrokes to express the grand scene of Soviet industry from recovery to prosperity, gives people a sense of heroism and strength. This characteristic of expressing rather than narrating life is also possessed by some of the prints mentioned earlier. However, at present, there are still many works (and not just prints) that reflect the theme of industrial construction that lack passion for labor construction. The authors often just indifferently move some construction sites and labor scenes into the picture, are not good at seeing the most important things, are not good at summarizing the objects to be expressed, and are even less able to explore the beauty in labor creation. Therefore, the description of labor production does not express the spirit of workers' conscious labor; the description of industrial scenery does not express moving poetry. There are also such works in the exhibition.
    Recently, a friend who went deep into the factory to work talked about the changes in his thoughts and feelings during the labor. He said that only after personally participating in the labor did he realize why he always lacked appeal when expressing industrial themes in the past. In the past, creation was only felt as a "need" and "should," and he did not truly enter the life he was expressing to experience, conceive, and create. Such works lacking enthusiasm cannot be touching.
    The great achievements of the working people in socialist construction, and their rich spiritual and cultural life, are endless treasures of artistic creation. Painters who have already mustered up revolutionary enthusiasm, delve into this treasure!

    新人新作
    马克
    看过第三届全国版画展览的人，都会产生一种“新”的感觉。的确，这次展览中除了老作者和近年来成长起的作者如赵宗藻、李唤民、庄元、吴燃、莫测、梁栋等，又出现了陈天然、赵瑞椿、晓岗、羊争等一百二十多位新人，特别值得兴奋的是其中还有蒙古族、苗族和布依族的作者。他们都带着自己辛勤劳动的成品，走进了版画家的队伍。这是新的一面，但更重要的一面是版画家们在作品中所反映的新的生活，与在艺术上那种新的、独创的探求。
    如何反映工农业生产建设事业，是版画家们的一个重要课题。这次展览中有关歌颂工业建设的作品，创作的水平比上届展览也有所提高。例如赵瑞椿的“合力”，用特写式的构图，明快的黑白对比和有力的线条，表现了炼钢工人在紧张劳动中团结一致的精神，显示了劳动者的威力，给人的印象深刻。郑震在“在佛子岭人造湖上”，努力揭示了自然经过人力改造后的美。画面上，前景垂直的树木与平行的水坝相交叉；后景起伏连绵的山头与平静的湖水相对衬；来往安全行驶的船只与水库的联系，种种匠心的安排和描绘，能使人产生一种和平、宁静的感觉。其他像“最后一根钢梁”、“湛江的黎明”、“狮子滩工地”和“热电厂建设”等，也都是比较成功的作品。这不只是说明作者对于祖国劳动建设的激情，而且也表明我国新兴版画继承了与现实斗争紧密结合的革命传统。
    艺术创作产生于充沛的感情，诉之于生动的形象，而通过形象再去感染别人，这是许多成功的作品一再证明了的。记得我读苏联小说“士敏土”，就是先是书中的木刻插图引起的。版画家梅斐尔德对工业建设的激情吸引了我。特别是“波浪”那一幅，画面上以粗壮奔放的刀法，表现了苏联工业自恢复而盛大的情景，给人以豪迈、强大的感觉。这种是表现而不是叙述生活的特点，也为前面所提到的一些版画所具有。但是，目前仍有不少反映工业建设题材的作品（也不只是版画），对劳动建设是缺乏激情的。作者往往只是漠不关心地把一些工地和劳动场面搬进画面，不善于看到最重要的东西，也不善于概括所要表现的对象，更谈不上去发掘劳动创造当中的美。因此，描绘劳动生产的表达不出工人自觉劳动的精神面貌；描绘工业风景的表达不出动人的诗意。展览中也有这种作品。
    最近，有一位深入工厂劳动的朋友谈起他在劳动中思想情感的变化，他说亲身参加劳动之后，才发现过去在表现工业题材时，为什么总是缺乏感染力的原因。过去创作只是感到“需要”和“应该”，而没有真正走进自己所表现的生活中去体会、孕育和创造。这种缺乏热情的作品，自然不能感人。
    劳动人民在社会主义建设中的丰功伟绩，和他们丰富的精神与文化生活，是艺术创作无穷无尽的宝藏。已经鼓起革命干劲的画家们，深入这个宝藏吧！
