Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22nd: Indonesian Army Intelligence Chief Sukendro said on the 21st, in response to questions from Western reporters, that the weapons airdropped to the rebel groups in Central Sumatra came from Taiwan, including mortars, anti-tank rocket launchers, and various automatic rifles. These weapons were airdropped by DC4 transport planes from Taiwan.

Sukendro said he did not know if the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan was directly involved in transporting arms to the rebel groups, but he could say with certainty that the rebel groups had contact with some generals of the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan.

It is reported that many of the weapons airdropped to the rebel groups in Pekanbaru on March 12th were brand new weapons manufactured in the United States in 1957.

According to the "Eastern Star" newspaper, on March 14th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, the defected former Commander of the Indonesian Seventh Military District, Sumual, and senior officials of the Chiang Kai-shek group held a secret meeting in Taipei. During the meeting, Dulles demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek group rapidly assist the rebel groups in Padang and Manado in Indonesia, and that the United States would increase its aid to the Chiang Kai-shek group.

On the same day, the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper revealed that before the Indonesian government forces liberated eastern Central Sumatra, the U.S. government had told the Indonesian government that it would send troops to land in Pekanbaru. The newspaper said that the United States was originally prepared to use eight large helicopters, paratroopers, and warships to land in Pekanbaru and its surrounding areas.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said it obtained this information from government sources. At that time, the U.S. government made this request through its chargé d'affaires in Indonesia, with the excuse that they wanted to protect American capital – especially oil fields – and also evacuate American and other foreign nationals from the area.

The newspaper said that the Indonesian government firmly rejected this American request through its Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

    印度尼西亚军方和报纸揭露
    美蒋串同支持叛乱集团
    空投的美国武器来自台湾
    据新华社雅加达22日电印度尼西亚陆军情报处长苏肯德罗21日在回答西方记者提出的问题时说，空投给中苏门答腊叛乱分子的武器来自台湾，其中包括迫击炮、对付战车的火箭炮和各种自动步枪。这些武器是由来自台湾的DC4式运输机空投的。
    苏肯德罗说，他不知道台湾蒋介石集团是否同运送军火给叛乱集团这件事直接有关，但是，他可以肯定地说，叛乱集团曾经同台湾蒋介石集团的一些将领有过接触。
    据悉，3月12日在北干巴鲁空投给叛乱分子的许多武器都是1957年美国制造的崭新的武器。
    另据“东星报”报道说，3月14日，美国国务卿杜勒斯、叛变的前印度尼西亚第七军区司令苏穆阿尔和蒋介石集团的高级官员曾经在台北举行过秘密会谈。在会谈中，杜勒斯要求蒋介石集团迅速援助印度尼西亚巴东和万鸦老的叛乱集团，同时美国将增加对蒋介石集团的援助。
    同一天“印度尼西亚火炬报”透露，在印度尼西亚政府部队解放中苏门答腊东部之前，美国政府曾经向印度尼西亚政府说，它将派军队在北干巴鲁登陆。这家报纸说，美国原来准备用八架大型直升飞机、伞兵和军舰在北干巴鲁和它周围的地区登陆。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，它是从政府人士那里得到这个消息的。当时美国政府通过它的驻印度尼西亚的代办提出了这个要求，美国的借口是，他们要保护美国的资本——特别是油田，而且还要撤出这个地区的美国侨民和其他外侨。
    这家报纸说，印度尼西亚政府通过它的总理和外交部长坚决拒绝了美国的这种要求。
