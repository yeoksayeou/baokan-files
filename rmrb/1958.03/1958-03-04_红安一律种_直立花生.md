Hong'an to Plant Only “Erect Peanuts”
(Reported by this newspaper) In an effort to achieve a peanut yield of 1,000 catties per mu this year, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, will eliminate trailing and other mixed varieties in peanut planting and adopt only "erect peanuts." This type of peanut can be planted at a higher density and produces a higher yield than common peanuts.
