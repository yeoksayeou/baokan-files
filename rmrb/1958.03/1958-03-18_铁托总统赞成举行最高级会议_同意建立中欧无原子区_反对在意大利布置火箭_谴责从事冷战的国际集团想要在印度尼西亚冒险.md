Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency: Yugoslav President Tito stated on the 16th that Yugoslavia advocates for a summit meeting. Currently, major issues cannot be resolved within the United Nations. A summit meeting may be a powerful step towards further facilitating understanding between major powers.

　　Tito made the remarks during a mass rally in Belgrade to welcome the upcoming Federal National Assembly elections in late March. Approximately 300,000 citizens from Belgrade and the surrounding areas participated in the rally.

　　Tito believes that the sentiment around the world has reached a point where the idea of holding a summit meeting has taken root in people's hearts. This trend among people of all nations will certainly compel those who are still resisting to see that such a meeting should be held.

　　Tito said that when he saw the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a summit meeting, he was pleased, believing that these proposals were very realistic and acceptable. However, he was displeased when he saw counter-proposals being put forward with the aim of preventing a summit meeting from taking place. He said that the West had previously suggested holding a meeting of foreign ministers of major powers, but now that the Soviet Union has agreed to hold a meeting of foreign ministers, the West is putting forward other suggestions. They are thus attempting to avoid holding such meetings, while on the other hand advocating for a one-on-three meeting that cannot resolve the problem.

　　Tito said that the reason why those who still oppose such a meeting are against holding it is because they are afraid that their actual ideas about the future development and prospects of the world will be exposed, that is, whether they are in favor of continuing the Cold War, whether they are in favor of banning nuclear testing, and so on.

　　Tito expressed hope that the issue of banning atomic weapons testing would be discussed at the summit meeting. He reiterated the need for certain countries that do not participate in military blocs to participate in high-level meetings, believing that these countries can put forward constructive suggestions and opinions, thereby contributing to the success of the meeting. He said that Yugoslavia would even welcome a meeting without its participation.

　　Tito emphasized that Yugoslavia agrees with Poland's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He also opposed the practice of setting up rocket launch sites in Italy.

　　Regarding the situation in Indonesia, Tito said that he feared that certain international groups advocating for the Cold War might want to launch an adventure from Indonesia, thereby affecting the entire world. He said that someone is selling weapons in Indonesia to a counter-revolutionary government, to the Franco of Indonesia, thereby causing bloodshed. This matter is deeply disturbing.

　　Tito condemned the practices in the Mediterranean, Algeria, Tunisia, and other places of using force and suppressing the people's spontaneous desire to be masters of their own land to solve problems. He said that the purpose of proposing a new Mediterranean pact is merely to divide Arab countries, divide the people of African countries, and to create a more difficult situation.

　　In his speech, Tito also talked about Yugoslavia's internal situation and Yugoslavia's relations with various countries, among many other issues.

    铁托总统赞成举行最高级会议
    同意建立中欧无原子区　反对在意大利布置火箭
    谴责从事冷战的国际集团想要在印度尼西亚冒险
    新华社17日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：南斯拉夫总统铁托16日说，南斯拉夫主张举行最高级会议，现在，重大问题不能在联合国内求得解决，最高级会议可能是进一步促使大国之间取得谅解的一个有力的步骤。
    铁托是在贝尔格莱德的一个迎接即将在3月下旬举行的联邦国民议会选举的群众大会上发表演讲。参加这次大会的有贝尔格莱德和附近地区大约三十万公民。
    铁托认为，今天全世界的情绪已经达到这种地步：举行最高级会议的主张已经深入人心，各国人民的这种趋向一定会迫使仍然在抗拒的那些人看到应该举行这种会议。
    铁托说，当他看到苏联关于举行最高级会议的建议的时候，他感到高兴，他认为，这些建议是很实事求是、很可以接受的。但是，当他看到正在提出目的在于不举行最高级会议的反建议的时候，他就感到不高兴了。他说，西方早先曾经建议举行大国外交部长会议，而现在，当苏联同意举行外交部长会议的时候，西方却提出别的建议来了。他们就是这样企图避免举行这类会议，而在另一方面却主张举行一个一对三的不能解决问题的会议。
    铁托说，仍然反对这种会议的人所以反对举行这种会议，是因为他们害怕，他们对于世界将来发展和前途的实际想法会暴露出来，那就是说，他们是否赞成继续进行冷战，是否赞成禁止原子试验等等。
    铁托表示希望在最高级会议上讨论禁止原子武器试验问题。他重申有必要让某些不参加军事集团的国家参加高级会议，他认为这些国家能够提出建设性的建议和意见，从而有助于会议的成功。他说，南斯拉夫甚至欢迎举行没有它参加的会议。
    铁托强调指出南斯拉夫同意波兰关于建立中欧无原子武器区的计划。他还反对在意大利设置火箭发射场的作法。
    谈到印度尼西亚的情况，铁托说，他担心恐怕某些主张进行冷战的国际集团想要从印度尼西亚发动一次冒险，从而波及全世界。他说，有人正在印度尼西亚把武器卖给一个反革命政府，卖给印度尼西亚的佛朗哥，从而造成流血。这件事使人们深感不安。
    铁托谴责地中海、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯等地正在发生的用武力、用压制人民要求成为自己土地主人的自发愿望的办法来解决问题的做法。他说，建立一个新的地中海公约的主张的目的不过是为了分裂阿拉伯国家，分裂非洲各国人民，并且为了制造一个更加困难的局面。
    铁托在演讲中还谈到了南斯拉夫的内部局势以及南斯拉夫同各国关系等其他许多问题。
