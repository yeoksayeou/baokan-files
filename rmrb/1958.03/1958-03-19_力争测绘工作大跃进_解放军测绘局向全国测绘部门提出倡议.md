    Strive for a Great Leap Forward in Surveying and Mapping Work
    PLA Surveying and Mapping Bureau Issues Proposal to National Surveying and Mapping Departments
    (Our dispatch) The officers, soldiers, and engineering technicians of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Headquarters Surveying and Mapping Bureau recently sent a proposal to more than 100 surveying and mapping departments across the country, including the Ministry of Geology's Surveying and Mapping Bureau, calling for a Great Leap Forward in national surveying and mapping work to meet the needs of national construction.
    After conducting a thorough campaign against conservatism and waste, the PLA General Staff Headquarters Surveying and Mapping Bureau decided to break with convention and leap forward. In 1958, they plan to increase the workload of geodetic surveying, topographic surveying, aerial surveying, calculation work, and map printing by 40% to 60% compared to 1957. Within two years, they aim to have the speed and precision of these projects reach the published levels of advanced countries in the world. Furthermore, within three to five years, they aim to have their surveying and mapping scientific level catch up with the actual level achieved by advanced countries in the world.

    力争测绘工作大跃进
    解放军测绘局向全国测绘部门提出倡议
    本报讯　人民解放军总部测绘局全体官兵和工程技术人员，最近向地质部测绘局等全国一百多个测绘部门送出了一件倡议书，提出让全国测绘工作也来个大跃进，以适应国家建设的需要。
    解放军总部测绘局在深入进行了反保守反浪费的运动后，决定打破常规，向前跃进。他们要在1958年将大地测量、地形测量、航空测绘、计算工作以及制印图纸等工程量，比1957年提高40％到60％；要在二年内使这些工程的作业速度和质量的精密程度，分别赶上世界先进国家已经公布的水平；并且要在三年到五年的时间里，使自己的测绘科学水平，赶上世界先进国家实际达到的水平。
