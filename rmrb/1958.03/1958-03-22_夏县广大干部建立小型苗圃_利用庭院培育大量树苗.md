Xia County's Extensive Cadres Establish Small Nurseries
Utilizing Courtyards to Cultivate a Large Number of Seedlings

(Our dispatch) The cadres at all levels in Xia County, Shanxi Province, are universally utilizing empty spaces in their courtyards to establish small nurseries, providing a good solution to the problem of insufficient seedlings.

As early as the spring of 1957, Liu Qingquan, the secretary of the Xia County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to learn nursery knowledge and facilitate leadership in forestry work, selected two fen of land in the county committee courtyard and cultivated more than 1,000 saplings of Chinese poplar, elm, and ailanthus. Over the past year, he has realized that this method can not only learn technology, decorate the courtyard, but also use waste land to cultivate a lot of seedlings. He issued a call to the whole county, hoping that all party members, league members, township, and commune cadres would each find a nursery plot. On January 20th of this year, he opened up half a mu of land in the county committee courtyard and, together with correspondent Han Fuwon and theory instructor Li Wanrui, accumulated snow on the ground once. Liu Qingquan also spent three and a half days on the first, second, and third days of the Lunar New Year to plow the nursery land once. Zhang Shaowen, an office cadre of the county committee, and Wang Baoling, a cadre of the rural work department, and other five people formed a seedling cultivation group and began seedling cultivation on February 27. By the beginning of March, twenty-one ridges of Chinese poplar, Xiaoye poplar, Baizhua willow (Mantou willow), Canadian poplar, black locust, and ailanthus seedlings had been cultivated, and sowing work is still continuing. By autumn of this year, 12,000 seedlings can be produced.

Under the influence of the secretary, a wave of establishing small nurseries using empty spaces in courtyards has been formed in Xia County. Deputy Secretary Zhao Yunshan, Discipline Inspection Commission Secretary Hu Langxuan, and the ministers of the agricultural, industrial, united front, propaganda, and organization departments, clerks, correspondents, cooks, and some family members are also opening up small nurseries in front of their office doors and dormitory doors. The cadres of the Xia County People's Committee and its subordinate bureaus, supply and marketing cooperatives, the cadres of the Communist Youth League County Committee, the faculty and students of middle schools, etc., have also taken action. According to preliminary estimates, there are about 10,000 party members, league members, and cadres of organs, townships, and communes in Xia County. If each person cultivates one ridge of seedlings, 3 to 4 million seedlings can be produced this year, equivalent to the total number of trees planted in the county in the whole year of 1956 (3.64 million trees).

    夏县广大干部建立小型苗圃
    利用庭院培育大量树苗
    本报讯　山西省夏县各级干部普遍利用庭院空地建立小型苗圃，为解决树苗不足的问题提供了一个好办法。
    早在1957年春天，中共夏县委员会书记刘清泉为了学习育苗知识，便于领导林业工作，在县委会院内选了二分地，培育了钻天杨、榆树、臭椿苗木一千多株。一年来，他体会到这个办法既能学习技术，点缀庭院，又能利用废地培育出不少的苗木，就向全县发出号召，希望全县党员、团员、乡、社干部每人找一畦育苗地。今年1月20日他又在县委会院内部开了半亩地，和通讯员韩福元、理论教员李万瑞在地上积了一次雪。刘清泉又在旧历正月初一、初二、初三，用三个半天将圃地翻耕一遍。县委办公室干事张绍温、农村工作部干事汪宝龄等五人成立了一个育苗小组，2月27日开始育苗。到3月初，已育钻天杨、小叶杨、百爪柳（馒头柳）、加拿大杨、洋槐、臭椿苗共二十一畦，播种工作还在继续。到今年秋后可产苗一万二千株。
    在书记的影响下，目前夏县全县已形成了利用庭院空地建立小型苗圃的热潮。副书记赵云山、监委书记胡朗轩和农工、统战、宣传、组织各部部长，事务员、通讯员、炊事员以及部分家属都在办公室门前、宿舍门前空地上开辟小型苗圃。县人民委员会和它所属的各局、供销合作社的干部，共青团县委的干部，中学的教职员、学生等，也都行动起来。据初步估计，夏县全县的党员、团员和机关、乡、社干部约有一万人，每人育苗一畦，今年可产苗三、四百万株，相当于1956年全年全县植树的总数（三百六十四万株）。
