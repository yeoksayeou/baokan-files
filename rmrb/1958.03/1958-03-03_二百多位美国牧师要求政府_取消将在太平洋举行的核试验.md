Xinhua News Agency, Minneapolis, 2nd: More than two hundred church pastors in Minnesota today wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower, demanding that he cancel the nuclear weapons tests that the U.S. government plans to begin in the Pacific in April of this year. In their letter, they also called on the President to seek world-scale disarmament.
    These pastors said in their letter that testing such weapons of mass destruction has a devastating impact on living things and is morally unjustifiable. The letter also stated that every such test only increases the atmosphere of harm to democracy and accelerates the advent of war, fear, and suspicion.

    二百多位美国牧师要求政府
    取消将在太平洋举行的核试验
    新华社2日讯　明尼苏达州明尼阿波利斯消息：明尼苏达州的二百多个教会牧师今天写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，要求他取消美国政府准备在今年4月开始在太平洋举行的核武器试验。他们在信中还呼吁总统设法促成世界规模的裁减军备。
    这些牧师在信中说，试验这种大规模毁灭性武器给生物带来毁灭性的影响，而在道德上更是讲不过去的。信里还说，每一次这样的试验都只会增加损害民主和加速战争到来的气氛、恐惧和猜疑。
