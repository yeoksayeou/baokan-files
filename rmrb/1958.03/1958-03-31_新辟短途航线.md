New Short-Haul Air Routes

    This newspaper reports that in order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Civil Aviation Administration of China is actively preparing to open local short-haul air routes. In addition to the Lanzhou to Xining and Hefei to Fuyang routes that have already been opened, the Chengdu to Xichang and Kunming to Baoshan routes will also be opened in April.

    Local short-haul air routes are a relatively economical and most convenient means of transportation. For example, it used to take two or three days to travel from Hefei to Fuyang by train or car, but after opening the local air route, it only takes one hour, and the fare is only 20 yuan, which is not much different from the ground transportation price.

    In order to meet the needs of local construction, the Civil Aviation Administration of China also plans to open routes such as Hefei to Tunxi, Hefei to Tongguanshan, Xi'an to Yan'an, and Harbin to Jiamusi this year. (Attached picture)

    新辟短途航线
    本报讯　中国民用航空局为了适应工农业生产跃进的需要，正积极准备开辟地方短途航线。除了已经开辟的兰州到西宁、合肥到阜阳两条航线以外，4月间还要开辟成都到西昌和昆明到保山两条线。
    地方短途航线是一种比较经济和最方便的交通线。例如过去从合肥到阜阳坐火车、汽车要走两三天，开辟地方航线以后，只要一小时就到了，票价只有二十元，跟地面运价相差无几。
    为了适应地方建设的需要，中国民用航空局还计划在今年内开辟合肥到屯溪、合肥到铜官山、西安到延安和哈尔滨到佳木斯等航线。（附图片）
