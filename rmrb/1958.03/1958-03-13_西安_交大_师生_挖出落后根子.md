Xi'an Dispatch: Teachers, students, and staff of Jiaotong University fought hard for three days and nights, using 800,000 big-character posters to vehemently attack conservatism and waste, sweeping away the "five airs." Why has Jiaotong University consistently lagged behind in various movements over the past year? The masses have now dug out the root cause. Many big-character posters sharply criticize some leading cadres for harboring conservative ideas, lacking revolutionary zeal, and carrying the burden of Jiaotong University's long history and status as a key school. They demand the elimination of bureaucratic airs, lethargy, and conservative thinking.

The Propaganda Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an on-site meeting at the university on the 8th, organizing leading cadres from various universities in Xi'an to visit and learn from their revolutionary drive.

    西安“交大”师生
    挖出落后根子
    本报西安讯　交通大学师生员工苦战三昼夜，八十万张大字报猛攻保守、浪费，横扫“五气”。交通大学最近一年来在各项运动中为什么总落在后面？这个根子这次被群众挖出来了。许多大字报尖锐地批评一些领导干部存在保守思想，缺乏革命干劲，背上交大历史悠久，是重点学校的老包袱，要求打掉官风暮气和保守思想。
    中共陕西省委宣传部于8日在该校召集现场会议，组织西安各高等学校的领导干部前往参观，学习他们的革命干劲。
