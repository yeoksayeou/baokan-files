    The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi are realizing a grand plan with the revolutionary vigor of "overcoming drought and controlling floods better than Yu the Great, and moving mountains and overturning seas like the Foolish Old Man." The ten-year target of 800 jin per mu of grain will be achieved in six years. By 1963, the total grain output of the region will reach 24 billion jin, an increase of 122% compared with 1957. By 1962, the sugarcane planting area will be developed from 550,000 mu to 2 million mu, with a yield of more than 8,000 jin per mu. Within five years, the number of live pigs will increase from 5.28 million to 20 million, and the number of cattle will increase from 4.27 million to 6.76 million. The entire province will be basically afforested within five years, and the "four pests" will be basically eliminated within five years. By 1963, the total output value of local industry (including handicrafts) should exceed the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries, reaching 3.7 billion yuan, an increase of more than six times compared with 1957.
    The biggest natural disaster in Guangxi is drought. Under the slogan of "Fighting hard for three years to conquer the thousand-year drought," the people of all ethnic groups are determined to make the 1958 water conservancy construction projects numerous and good. Tens of thousands of cadres and nearly three million laborers are working day and night in the cold wind and rain to block rivers, block valleys, dig rock springs, and repair ditches. As of early February, there were more than 120,000 water conservancy projects under construction in the province, which can irrigate more than 12 million mu of farmland, exceeding the total irrigated area of water conservancy projects built during the first five-year plan period. This is more than all the water conservancy projects built in the province from the time of Qin Shihuang's construction of the Xing'an Lingqu to the liberation of Guangxi, a period of more than 2,000 years. As of March 2, 64% of the water conservancy projects have been completed.
    The fertilizer accumulation movement is also being carried out on a grand scale. Men, women, old and young, work day and night. In addition to "everyone having a toilet, cattle having a pen, pigs having a sty, and chickens and ducks having a nest," they are also digging pond mud, collecting leaves, and cutting grass to accumulate fertilizer. As of March 2, the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province reached more than 4.2 billion dan, with an average of more than 15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of land.
    Around the Spring Festival, tents were set up on many mountain tops, and thousands of people collectively reclaimed land and afforested. In the Yishan area, which is rich in timber, the afforestation habits of previous years were broken, and afforestation began in January this year. Now the afforestation area completed in the province has more than doubled the original plan.
    Before the liberation of Guangxi, the industrial base was extremely weak, and there was almost no modern industry. After liberation, 107 new and rebuilt modern factories have been built in the region, and the total industrial output value (including handicrafts) has accounted for 32.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Grain has increased from more than 10 billion jin in 1952 to more than 10.8 billion jin in 1957, and the average yield per mu has reached 360 jin. In the past few years, the irrigated area of water conservancy projects built in the province has reached 20 million mu. On this basis, the great leap forward in Guangxi's construction is entirely possible.
    In order to adapt to the needs of the leap forward situation, the work style of cadres has begun to change greatly. Since last winter, tens of thousands of leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the grassroots and into various production activities, and a good atmosphere has been formed.
    Now the broad masses of cadres in the province have responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and are actively engaged in "experimental fields." According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 54,400 leading cadres and office cadres at the provincial, regional, county, district, township, and commune levels who have established their own "experimental fields."

    自治区将大跃进
    宫敬之
    广西各族人民正以“除旱治涝胜大禹，移山倒海赛愚公”的革命干劲，实现着一个宏伟的规划。把粮食亩产八百斤的十年指标提前于六年实现，到1963年全区粮食总产量达到二百四十亿斤，比1957年增加122％；到1962年甘蔗种植面积由五十五万亩发展到二百万亩，每亩产量八千斤以上。五年内生猪由五百二十八万头发展到二千万头；牛由四百二十七万只发展到六百七十六万只。五年全省基本完成绿化，五年基本消灭“四害”。到1963年地方工业总产值（包括手工业）要超过农副业总产值，达到三十七亿元，比1957年增加六倍多。
    广西最大的自然灾害就是干旱，各族人民在“苦战三年，征服千年旱灾”的口号下，决心把1958年度的水利建设搞得多而好。成千上万的干部和近三百万民工不分日夜地在寒风冷雨中拦江河，堵山谷，掘岩泉，修沟渠。到2月上旬止，全省开工的各项水利工程有十二万多处，可灌溉农田一千二百多万亩，超过第一个五年计划期间兴修水利灌溉面积的总和。比自秦始皇时代修建兴安灵渠起，到广西解放前的两千多年中全省修建的水利工程还多。到3月2日止，64％的水利工程已经完工。
    积肥运动也波澜壮阔地开展起来。男女老少不分日夜地干，除做到“人有厕所、牛有栏，猪有圈、鸡鸭有窝”外，还在挖塘泥、采树叶、割草积肥。到3月2日止，全省积肥总数达四十二亿多担，平均每亩田有肥一万五千多斤。
    春节前后，在许多山头上搭起了座座的帐棚，千千万万的人群集体在开荒造林。在盛产木材的宜山专区打破了历年的造林习惯，今年提前在1月间就开始造林。现在全省完成的造林面积已超过原计划一倍以上。
    广西解放以前，工业基础极为薄弱，几乎没有现代工业。解放后，全区新建、改建的现代化工厂有一百零七个，工业总产值（包括手工业）已占工农业总产值的32.5％。粮食已由1952年的一百亿多斤达到1957年的一百零八亿多斤，每亩产量平均已达三百六十斤。几年来全省兴修的水利灌溉面积达二千万亩。在这个基础上，广西建设事业的大跃进是完全可能的。
    为了适应跃进形势的需要，干部作风开始大转变。自去冬以来，数万名各级领导干部深入基层，深入各种生产活动现场，已经形成了一种良好的风气。
    现在全省广大干部响应了中共中央的号召，积极搞“试验田”。据不完全的统计，目前全省已有五万四千四百多名省、地、县、区、乡、社的领导干部和机关干部建立了各自的“试验田”。
