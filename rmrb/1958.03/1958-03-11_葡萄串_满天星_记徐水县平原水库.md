Grape Clusters, Stars Across the Sky
——A Record of the Plain Reservoir in Xushui County
By Our Reporter Zhang Chao

If you were to fly over Xushui County on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, you would discover that this plain, covering more than 600 square kilometers, is dotted with newly built circular or elliptical embankments of all sizes. Some are already filled with water, sparkling in the sunlight. This is the miracle created by the farmers of Xushui County in the short three months of winter – the plain reservoir complex.

Looking down more closely, you would see clusters of reservoirs of varying density, closely adjacent to the riverbanks, some even spanning the rivers themselves. You would exclaim: "How much these resemble bunches of grapes!" Indeed, these are called "grape cluster reservoirs." Did you know that the farmers of Xushui County, like other farmers on the northern plains, have been at the mercy of these rivers for generations? Take the Cao River, which flows from west to east in the north, for example. During the rainy season, mountain torrents would erupt, causing floods and breaches everywhere. In dry weather, the riverbed would dry up, and the crops on both banks would wither. Now, with the grape cluster reservoirs, coupled with the mountain reservoirs upstream, the floodwaters are intercepted section by section during the rainy season, rendering them useless. According to hydrological data, the maximum flood in 1954 had a flow rate of 430 cubic meters per second. Now these reservoirs can divert more than 140 cubic meters per second in a single day and night, while their guaranteed water level is 290 cubic meters per second, ensuring that the Cao River can no longer breach its banks. Floodwaters entering the reservoirs deposit silt, which can improve more than 10,000 mu of soil within the reservoirs. During droughts, water can be released in four stages to irrigate more than 70,000 mu. Lotus roots, reeds, and flood-resistant crops can also be grown in the reservoirs. Therefore, they are also called "flood storage and crop cultivation reservoirs."

Looking down more closely, you would also see a larger number of reservoirs, scattered and concentrated, across the vast plains. You would exclaim again: "How much these resemble stars across the sky!" Indeed, these are called "stars across the sky reservoirs." Did you know that Xushui County, like other northern plains, has low-lying areas everywhere? During the rainy season, even without floods, there is surface water (groundwater). The surface water drains into the low-lying areas, causing waterlogging. In dry weather, the land becomes saline-alkali, with yields of only a few dozen jin per mu. Before liberation, there was a folk song that went: "Don't marry your daughter to the low-lying village, carrying seedling baskets all day long, eating sorghum pancakes and drinking seedling soup." Now, with the stars across the sky reservoirs, surface water can be absorbed during the rainy season, and water can be released for irrigation during droughts. Lotus roots, reeds, and flood-resistant crops can also be grown in the reservoirs. Therefore, they are also called "surface water storage and crop cultivation reservoirs."

Looking down more closely, you can also see channels connecting many of the reservoirs. You would exclaim again: "How much these resemble a net!" Indeed, the entire plain forms a water conservancy and irrigation network with rivers connected to rivers, reservoirs connected to reservoirs, and channels connected to channels, arranged like chess pieces on a chessboard, and so they are also called "scattered like stars on a chessboard."

Of course, from an airplane, you cannot notice the many more and smaller satellite reservoirs, small ponds, and wells of various kinds, all of which serve the plain reservoirs.

However, you will certainly see many places crowded with ant-like black masses of people. If you fly over at night, this place turns into a sea of fire. These are members of agricultural cooperatives rushing to build plain reservoirs. Did you know that in the short three months of winter, the farmers of Xushui County have been working day and night to build more than 120 plain reservoirs? They will continue to complete dozens of plain reservoirs before the spring plowing arrives. When you fly over this place again in a few months, you will find many new stars.

Of course, there are far more heroes and good men than these stars and grapes. Let's just talk about one reservoir. This reservoir is called "Treasure Basin," located near Dawangdian Village south of Xushui County. It has already accumulated water above sixteen chi. More than 700 male and female members of the cooperative spent only four days (from December 6th to 9th last year), using only one jiao of government money, to build this "Treasure Basin" that can store 250,000 cubic meters of water and irrigate more than 2,500 mu of land. At that time, it was the height of winter, with heavy snowfall or bitter north winds. Every day, as soon as the rooster crowed three times, these heroes and good men would flock to the construction site and fight hard until late at night, even until dawn. Liu Baoqi, the secretary of the township Party committee, and five township cadres took the lead in jumping into the cold, bone-chilling water to scoop water and dig mud. Following them, hundreds of heroes and good men also joined the battle. Cooperative member Wang Fenghai, once his energy surged, simply took off his cotton-padded clothes and pants and went into battle bare-chested. A stone broke his foot, and the commander advised him to step down from the front line, but he refused. He and many good men waved their fists and swore: We will never withdraw until the reservoir is completed! Li Yue, the director of the health clinic, carried his medicine kit and rushed to the construction site day and night. Handicraft workers who made agricultural tools during the day, restaurant staff and bank office cadres who had worked all day, also hammered with the cooperative members until dawn at night. More than 100 shock team members, led by Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, worked like lively dragons and tigers. Among them, more than 30 people became labor models. In this way, in four days, they transformed this "useless depression" that had tormented people for generations into the "Treasure Basin."

You must know the legend of Yu the Great controlling the floods. For four thousand years, his flood control ideology, which emphasized drainage, has been passed down from generation to generation. In fact, his father Gun's flood control ideology, which emphasized storage, was much more brilliant than Yu the Great's. Unfortunately, his grand ambitions were not realized, and he was executed by Yao on Mount Yu for failing to control the floods. His flood control ideology was also lost. However, only today's farmers, who have broken the shackles of productive forces, have the ability to realize Gun's grand ambitions, promote his flood control ideology, and confine the water section by section and piece by piece, subduing the water that has been difficult to control since ancient times. Aren't the farmers of Xushui County successfully doing such a heroic undertaking? However, it must be said that things are not that simple. Zhang Guozhong, the secretary of the Xushui County Party Committee, said it well: In the past few years, they had also been unconsciously influenced by Yu the Great's emphasis on drainage. After draining water for a few years, the water still didn't listen to you. At the same time, they wanted to rely on large-scale projects and the state. After delaying for a few years, large-scale projects were not completed, and small-scale projects were also delayed.

In early winter last year, they were inspired by the experience of harnessing the Mang River, and they reversed the wrong flood control ideology and resolutely implemented the policy of "emphasizing storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing cooperative management," putting forward the slogan of "treating mountains, plains, and low-lying areas together, combining flood prevention, waterlogging prevention, and drought resistance." As a result, the idea of plain reservoirs came out. They led several township cadres to visit the prototype of the only plain reservoir in Anxin County, which was built with state funds. After returning, they created the first cooperative-managed Shigezhuang flood storage and crop cultivation reservoir. From then on, plain reservoirs appeared one by one and in groups.

You may ask, how useful are plain reservoirs? Let's just calculate two rough accounts.

First account: The existing reservoir project has more than 4 million cubic meters of earthwork, using more than 1.2 million workdays, which can basically eliminate drought, waterlogging, and floods for 450,000 mu of farmland. On average, each mu only requires nine cubic meters of earth and only takes three workdays. Isn't this completely in line with the principle of more, better, faster, and more economical results? In the past, many people thought that plain water conservancy was difficult to solve, or they focused on ditches, ponds, and wells. These types of projects store little water, require a lot of labor, and have little effect. They cannot absorb flood surface water during the flood season, and they cannot irrigate much land during the drought season. In the past few years, Xushui County has dug ditches with a total length of 150 kilometers, which can only store more than 300,000 cubic meters of water. Now, the Shigezhuang Reservoir, which was completed in eight days, can store more than 10 million cubic meters.

Second account: The existing reservoirs have a total area of more than 35,000 mu. In previous years, the average yield per mu in these low-lying areas was only about 50 jin. According to the data from a reservoir in Langwangzhuang, within this reservoir with an area of 4,000 mu, 1,000 mu of sorghum, 300 mu of blue hemp, 500 mu of lotus root, and 750 mu of reeds can be planted. Fish can be raised in long-term water storage areas (the lowest places). It is estimated that each mu can increase production by 100 jin. This means that the total output in the reservoir in the past was 200,000 jin. What about now? Just the 2,550 mu of crops can increase production by 250,000 jin, and the total output reaches 370,000 jin, nearly doubled compared to previous years. This means that although the reservoir occupies 4% of the county's farmland, the income on this 4% of the area is nearly doubled compared to previous years.

So, when you fly over Xushui County, which resembles a bunch of grapes and stars across the sky, what associations will you have? When vast northern plains are covered with bunches of grapes and stars across the sky, what changes will take place in production and people's lives here?

    葡萄串  满天星
    ——记徐水县平原水库
    本报记者　张潮
    假如你坐着飞机飞过京汉铁路上的徐水县上空，你就会发现，在这块六百多平方公里的平原上，遍布大大小小新近出现的圆形或椭圆形围堤，有的里面已经蓄起了水，在阳光下闪闪发光。这就是徐水县农民在短暂的冬季三个月中创造的奇迹——平原水库群。
    你再仔细往下看，有疏密不匀的水库群紧挨着河流两岸，有的就跨在河流当中，你会叫起来：“这多么像一串串葡萄呀！”不错，这就叫葡萄串水库。你知道吗？徐水县农民和其他北方平原上的农民一样，世世代代听凭这些河流的欺凌。拿北面那条由西向东流的漕河来说吧，雨季山洪暴发，处处泛滥决口；天旱河床干涸，两岸庄稼枯萎。现在有了葡萄串水库，加上上游山上的山区水库，雨季把洪水一截一截地拦蓄起来，就使洪水无用武之地了。据水文资料记载，1954年最大洪水是四百三十个流量。现在这些水库一昼夜可以分洪一百四十多个流量，而它的保证水位是二百九十个流量，这就保证了漕河再不能决口了。洪水入库放淤，还能改良库内土壤一万多亩。天旱可以分四次放水，灌溉七万多亩。库内还可以种植藕、苇和耐涝作物等。所以，人们也管它叫蓄洪作物水库。
    你再仔细往下看，在广阔的平原上，还有分散和集中的数量更多的水库群。你又会叫起来：“这多么像满天星斗呀！”不错，这就叫满天星水库。你知道吗？徐水县同其他北方平原一样，到处都有低洼地，一到雨季，没有洪水也有沥水（地面水），沥水沥入低洼地，便成涝灾，天旱又变咸碱地，亩产量只有几十斤。解放前，有人编了这样一首歌谣：“有女不嫁洼地乡，整天背着青苗菜筐，吃的高粱面饼，喝的青苗菜汤”。现在有了满天星水库，到了雨季就可以把沥水吸进来，天旱也可以放水灌溉，库内也可以种植藕、苇和耐涝作物等。所以人们又管它叫蓄沥作物水库。
    你再仔细往下看，还可以看到许多水库之间有渠道相通。你又会叫起来：“这多么像罗网呀！”不错，整片平原形成了一个河河相通、库库相连、渠渠相接的水利灌溉网。宛如棋子摆满在棋盘上，所以又叫做“星罗棋布”。
    当然，你在飞机上不可能注意到更多更小的护村河、小坑塘、水井等各色各样平原水库的小卫星、小葡萄。
    但是，你一定会看到，许多地方挤满了蚂蚁般的黑压压的人群。假如你夜里飞过，这儿又变成了一片一片的火海。这就是正在赶修平原水库的农业社的社员们。你知道吗？在短暂的冬季三个月中，徐水县的农民就是这样夜以继日地修起了一百二十多座平原水库，他们还要在春耕到来以前继续完成几十座平原水库。几个月后你再坐飞机过这儿的时候，你又会发现许多新的星星了。
    当然，比这星星和葡萄多得多的是英雄和好汉。随便拿一个水库跟你谈谈吧。这个水库名叫“聚宝盆”，就在徐水县城南面大王店村的附近，现在已经蓄起了十六尺以上的水。七百多名男女社员，只花了四天时间（去年12月6日到9日），用了政府一角钱，就建成了这个蓄水二十五万方、浇地二千五百多亩的“聚宝盆”。那时正是大雪纷飞或者北风凛冽的隆冬时节，每天公鸡刚叫过三遍，这些英雄好汉们便涌向工地，一直苦战到深夜，甚至天明。乡党委书记刘宝奇和五名乡干部，带头跳进了冷彻骨髓的水里掏水挖泥，跟着，成百的英雄好汉也投入了战斗。社员王凤海，劲头一上来，索兴脱下棉衣裤，简直是赤膊上阵。石头砸破了他的脚，指挥员劝他下火线，被他拒绝了。他和许多好汉们挥舞着拳头宣誓：水库不成决不收兵！卫生所所长李跃背着医药箱，日夜奔走在工地上。白天赶制农具的手工业工人，工作了一天的饭店职员、银行营业所干部，夜里又同社员们一起打夯到拂晓。以共产党员、共青团员为首的一百多名突击队员，干起活来好似生龙活虎，其中三十多人成了劳动模范。就这样，他们在四天当中把这片世世代代折磨着人的“无用之洼”改造成了“聚宝盆”。
    你一定知道大禹治水的传说。四千年来，他的以泄为主的治水思想，世世相袭，代代相传。其实，他的父亲鲧的治水思想是以蓄为主，要比大禹高明得多，可惜大志未成，反被尧以治水无功之罪殛死在羽山，他的治水思想也就失传了。但是，只有今天打碎了生产力桎梏的农民，才有本领实现鲧的大志，发扬他的治水思想，把水一截截、一块块地关起来，把自古以来难以制服的水制服了。徐水县的农民，不是正在成功地干着这样的英雄事业吗？不过，话还得说回来，事情并不是那么简单。徐水县委书记张国忠说得好，过去几年，他们也一直不自觉地受着大禹的以泄为主的影响。泄了几年水，水依然不听你的话；同时，又想依靠大型，依靠国家，拖了几年，大型没搞成，小型也耽误了。
    去年初冬，他们受到了漭河治理经验的启发，才把错误的治水思想扭转过来，坚决贯彻“以蓄为主，小型为主，社办为主”的方针，提出了“山区、平原、洼地一齐治，防洪、防涝、抗旱结合搞”的口号。这一来，平原水库的主意也就出来了。他们带领几个乡干部，参观了国家出钱修建的安新县唯一的平原水库雏型，回来后创建了第一个社办为主的史各庄蓄洪作物水库。从此，平原水库一座座一群群地出现了。
    你也许会问，平原水库究竟有多大用处？这里只算两笔粗略的账吧。
    第一笔账：现有水库工程四百多万土方，用了一百二十多万个工，可使四十五万亩耕地基本上免除旱涝洪三灾。平均每亩只需九方土，只花三个工。这岂不完全符合多好快省的方针？过去，许多人以为平原水利难解决，或者把重点放在沟洫、坑塘和水井等工程上面，这类工程蓄水少，费工大、收效小，汛期吞不了洪沥水，旱期浇不了多少地。几年来，徐水县挖了全长一百五十公里的沟洫，只能蓄水三十多万方，现在，一个八天完成的史各庄水库就能蓄水一千多万方。
    第二笔账：现有水库总面积三万五千多亩，往年，这些低洼地的平均亩产量只有五十斤左右。根据郎王庄一个水库的资料，在这个面积四千亩的水库里面，可种高粱一千亩，青麻三百亩，藕五百亩，芦苇七百五十亩，长期蓄水处（最低的地方）可以养鱼，估计每亩能增产一百斤。这就是说，过去库内总产量是二十万斤。现在呢？单是那二千五百五十亩作物，就能增产二十五万斤，总产量达到三十七万斤，比往年增产近一倍。这就是说：水库虽然占了全县4％的耕地，但是这4％的面积上的收益反而比往年增产近一倍。
    那么，当你飞过这宛如葡萄串、满天星的徐水县境之后，你将会发生怎样的联想呢？当广大的北方平原都出现葡萄串和满天星的时候，这里的生产和人民生活又将会发生怎样的变化呢？
