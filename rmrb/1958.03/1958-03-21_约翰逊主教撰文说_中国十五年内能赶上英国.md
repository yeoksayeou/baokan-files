    Bishop Johnson Writes that
    China Can Catch Up with Britain in Fifteen Years
    (Our Moscow dispatch, March 20th) Bishop Johnson of Canterbury, England, wrote in an article to the Soviet "Literary Gazette" that China will definitely be able to catch up with Britain in fifteen years.
    The author also said: "The plan put forward by China is extremely grand, and its completion depends on three conditions: first, a firm will; second, mastering new technologies; and third, having the necessary raw material resources. Based on everything I saw with my own eyes during my second visit to China in 1956, I can say with certainty that China fully possesses these conditions."

    约翰逊主教撰文说
    中国十五年内能赶上英国
    本报莫斯科20日电　英国坎特伯雷主教约翰逊在给苏联“文学报”写的一篇文章中说：中国在十五年内一定能够赶上英国。
    作者还说：“中国提出的计划是异常宏伟的，它的完成要靠三个条件：第一是坚决的意志，其次是要掌握新技术，第三是要有必要的原料资源。我根据1956年第二次到中国时亲眼看到的一切，可以肯定地说，这些条件在中国是完全具备的。”
