Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 27th -- The Romanian government delegation, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chivu Stoica, departed Hanoi by special plane this afternoon for a visit to Burma after a five-day visit to Vietnam.

In his farewell speech at the airport, Chivu Stoica said that after the talks between the government delegations of Vietnam and Romania, a joint communiqué was signed an hour ago, and this joint communiqué is an important document in the relations between Vietnam and Romania. It demonstrates the will of the two countries to further develop and consolidate the comprehensive friendship and cooperative relations between socialist countries, and demonstrates the close relations between Vietnam and Romania and the socialist camp; it also demonstrates the common position of the two governments on international issues such as defending peace and upholding the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said in his speech that the joint communiqué signed by the government delegations of the two countries demonstrated the unity of the two countries on some issues related to each other and some major international issues. This unity strengthens the Vietnamese people's determination to build socialism and unify the motherland.

Before the delegation left, Chairman Ho Chi Minh hosted a luncheon at the Presidential Palace to entertain the delegation.

During their visit to Vietnam, the Romanian government delegation visited the Cam Pha open-pit coal mine, the Haiphong Cement Plant, and some scenic spots and historical sites. The delegation will pass through Kunming, China, en route to Burma.
