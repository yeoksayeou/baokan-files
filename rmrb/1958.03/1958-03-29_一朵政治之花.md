    A Political Flower

    The "experimental plot" in the factories of Tianjin's Hongqiao District has blossomed. The responsible comrades of the CPC District Committee in this district discovered and resolved the contradiction of casting production capacity not keeping up with the needs of the leap forward plan in mechanical manufacturing. Their method was to put politics in command and rely on the masses. As a result, they swept away the regressive thinking that advocated using machine processing to accommodate cast iron production, and persuaded those with the "seeing things, not people" mentality who advocated expanding factory buildings to reconcile the contradiction. They insisted on letting mechanical processing take the lead and allowing cast iron production to catch up, finally achieving a new balance. This vivid example contains profound significance in many aspects, proving the rich vitality of the leadership method of "experimental plots," proving that politics is the commander, the soul, and the guarantee for doing a good job in economic work, and proving that to develop production, one must use promoting methods to constantly break the old balance and establish a new balance.

    “试验田”在天津市红桥区的工厂里开出了一朵花。这个区的中共区委负责同志，发现和解决了铸件生产能力赶不上机械制造跃进计划需要的矛盾。他们的办法是政治挂帅、依靠群众。结果扫除了那种主张要机器加工来迁就铸铁生产的促退思想，说服了那种主张用扩建厂房来调和矛盾的“见物不见人”的思想，坚持让机械加工一马当先，让铸铁生产赶上来，终于求得了新的平衡。这个生动的事例包含着多方面的深刻意义，证明了“试验田”的领导方法的丰富生命力，证明了政治是统帅，是灵魂，是做好经济工作的保证，证明了要发展生产，就必须用促进的方法，不断地打破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡。预
