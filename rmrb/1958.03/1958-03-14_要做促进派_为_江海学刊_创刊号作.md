To Be a Promoter

--Written for the Inaugural Issue of "Jianghai Academic Journal"--

Lu Dingyi

	The founding of "Jianghai Academic Journal" coincides with the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

	In the past year, China has experienced a nationwide rectification campaign, a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and a nationwide Great Leap Forward in production. This Great Leap Forward in production has a scale and momentum that is overwhelming and earth-shattering. It has shaken the whole country and also the academic community. This Great Leap Forward indicates that the people of the whole country demand to build a socialist motherland with greater, faster, better and more economical results. It is certain that the National Program for Agricultural Development (Draft) with its forty articles can and will be fulfilled and overfulfilled within ten years. It is also certain that we will catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more.

	Now is the time when the Chinese people are full of spirit and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are bravely marching towards the great goal of building a socialist motherland. This is the best time in China's history. The Chinese people have already created many miracles, and they will certainly create new miracles in the future.

	Targets are being broken one after another, plans are being added to again and again, and more, faster, better and more economical methods are being created one after another. It is worth our social scientists thinking about: After the Three Great Transformations and the nationwide rectification campaign, how much potential is there in our factories, agricultural cooperatives, shops, and schools? Who has made a sufficient estimate of this potential?

	We have changed from the "sick man of East Asia" to "a giant dragon." Everyone must choose one of two paths. To be a retarder, hindering the advance of this socialist giant dragon? Or to be a promoter, promoting the development of social productive forces?

	Regarding the development of social productive forces, there are promoters and also retarders. The goal of us communists is simple and clear; we advocate promoting the development of social productive forces. We engage in revolution, engage in construction, do this kind of work or that kind of work, and in the final analysis, it is all to promote the development of social productive forces. History tells us that whoever wants to be a retarder, hindering the development of social productive forces, will certainly be abandoned by the people. Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism hindered the development of social productive forces, so they were overthrown. Capitalism is replaced by socialism also because the former hinders the development of social productive forces, while the latter promotes the development of social productive forces.

	The superstructure must serve the economic base and the development of productive forces. Ideology is a part of the superstructure. Philosophy, social sciences, literature, and art all belong to the scope of ideology.

	A year ago, Chairman Mao pointed out that in our country there are still situations where the relations of production are both in line with and in contradiction with the productive forces, and there are also situations where the superstructure is both in line with and in contradiction with the economic base. Chairman Mao said: "The state system of people's democratic dictatorship and the laws, the socialist ideology guided by Marxism-Leninism, these superstructures have played a positive role in promoting the victory of socialist transformation and the establishment of socialist labor organization in our country, and they are in line with the socialist economic base, that is, the socialist relations of production; however, the existence of bourgeois ideology, the existence of certain bureaucratic styles in state organs, and the existence of defects in certain links of the state system are in contradiction with the socialist economic base. In the future, we must continue to resolve the above-mentioned contradictions in accordance with the specific circumstances." Here, Chairman Mao pointed out that there are two opposing ideologies in our country. Socialist ideology is conducive to promoting the development of social productive forces, while bourgeois ideology only has a "retarding" effect on the development of social productive forces.

	The bourgeois rightists have already failed in the nationwide debate. However, only preliminary criticisms have been made of bourgeois philosophy, bourgeois political science, sociology, economics, law, education, journalism, and other social sciences, and bourgeois literature and art, while systematic criticisms are only just beginning. Serious systematic research on various social sciences and literature and art based on the investigation and study of our country's situation and incorporating international revolutionary experience is also only just beginning. Destruction and construction both require great effort.

	The launching of the Soviet artificial earth satellite into space, the emergence of the two Moscow Declarations of the Communist Parties of various countries, and the beginning of the new economic crisis in the United States have plunged the American bourgeois social sciences into a state of chaos. American literature and art have degenerated to the point where yellow novels, jitterbug dancing, and the "paintings" of chimpanzees reign supreme. Bourgeois philosophy, social sciences, literature, and art have completely gone bankrupt. It has only one use for us, and that is to be studied as poisonous weeds, so that we can have a negative teacher, learn to recognize poisonous weeds, and turn them into fertilizer after weeding them out. It is precisely in this sense that we must continue to study bourgeois philosophy, social sciences, literature, and art. The same is true for revisionism.

	Poisonous weeds hinder the development of social productive forces. Our social sciences—political science, economics, law, education, journalism, etc.—must serve to promote the social productive forces of our country. Our country's literature and art must also serve this purpose.

	Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is an important development of Marxism-Leninism. Whether it is revolution or construction, we must defeat the enemy and unite ourselves. Chairman Mao pointed out the two types of contradictions, contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and put forward methods for distinguishing and correctly handling the two types of contradictions with different natures. This pointed out the direction for our social science, literature, and art workers, because in all social sciences and literature and art, there are questions of how to distinguish between the two types of contradictions and how to correctly handle the two types of contradictions. This speech has played a guiding role in the correct conduct of our work of "destruction" and "construction." I suggest that everyone study this speech carefully several times and do some research on the "Compilation of Reading Documents for the Socialist Education Course" published by the People's Publishing House, which will be of great benefit to our work.

	Let us all work hard, help each other, and encourage each other to be promoters and not retarders. Let Marxism-Leninism establish a solid leading position in the academic field. Let our motherland prosper and become strong quickly!

    要做促进派
    ——为“江海学刊”创刊号作——
    陆定一
    “江海学刊”创刊，恰值毛主席发表“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的演讲的一周年。
    一年来，我国经历了全民整风即政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，出现了全国生产大跃进。这个生产大跃进，具有排山倒海、惊天动地的规模和气概。它震撼全国，也震撼学术界。这个生产大跃进，表示全国人民要求又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义祖国。在十年内完成和超额完成农业生产发展纲要（草案）四十条是一定做得到的。在十五年或更多一点时间内在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，也是一定做得到的。
    现在是我国人民精神奋发，在中国共产党的领导之下向建成社会主义祖国这个伟大目标勇敢迈进的时候。这是我国历史上从来未有的好时光。我国人民已经创造了许多奇迹，今后一定还会创造出新的奇迹来。
    指标一个接一个被突破，计划一次又一次被加码，多快好省的办法一个又一个被创造出来。很值得我们的社会科学家们想一想的问题是：经过了三大改造和全民整风之后，我们的工厂、农业合作社、商店、学校里究竟有多大的潜力？谁曾把这种潜力做了足够的估计？ 
    我们已经从“东亚病夫”变为“一条巨龙”。所有的人都要在两条道路中选择一条。做促退派，阻碍这条社会主义巨龙的前进？还是做促进派，促进社会生产力的发展？
    对社会生产力的发展，有促进派，也有促退派。我们共产主义者的目标，是简单明了的，我们主张促进社会生产力的发展。我们从事革命，从事建设，做这样工作或那样工作，归根结底，都是为了促进社会生产力的发展。历史告诉我们，谁要做促退派，阻碍社会生产力的发展，谁就一定会被人民抛弃。帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，阻碍社会生产力的发展，所以被打倒了。资本主义被社会主义所代替，也因为前者阻碍社会生产力的发展，而后者则促进社会生产力的发展。
    上层建筑必须为经济基础和生产力的发展服务。意识形态是上层建筑的一部分。哲学、社会科学、文学、艺术，都属于意识形态的范围。
    一年以前，毛主席指出，我国还有生产关系和生产力又相适应又相矛盾的情况，还有上层建筑和经济基础又相适应又相矛盾的情况。毛主席说：“人民民主专政的国家制度和法律，以马克思列宁主义为指导的社会主义意识形态，这些上层建筑对于我国社会主义改造的胜利和社会主义劳动组织的建立起了积极的推动作用，它是和社会主义的经济基础即社会主义的生产关系相适应的；但是，资产阶级意识形态的存在，国家机构中某些官僚主义作风的存在，国家制度中某些环节上缺陷的存在，又是和社会主义的经济基础相矛盾的。我们今后必须按照具体的情况，继续解决上述的各种矛盾。”在这里，毛主席指出了：在我国存在着两种对立的意识形态。社会主义的意识形态是有利于促进社会生产力的发展的，资产阶级的意识形态对社会生产力的发展只有“促退”的作用。
    资产阶级右派已经在全民大辩论中失败了。但是，对资产阶级哲学，对资产阶级的政治学、社会学、经济学、法学、教育学、新闻学等项社会科学，对资产阶级文学和艺术，还只作了初步的批判，而有系统的批判仅在开始。对以我国情况的调查研究为根据而又综合了国际革命经验的各项社会科学和文学艺术的认真的系统的研究，也仅在开始。一破一立，两者都需要大大努力。
    苏联人造地球卫星上天，各国共产党两个莫斯科宣言的出现，和美国新的经济危机的开始，使美国的资产阶级社会科学陷入一团混乱之中。美国的文学艺术堕落到让黄色小说、阿飞舞、黑猩猩的“绘画”在那里称王称霸。资产阶级的哲学、社会科学、文学、艺术，已经完全破产。它对我们只有一个用处，就是当作毒草来加以研究，以便使我们有个反面的教员，使我们学会认识毒草，并把毒草锄掉变为肥料。正是在这个意义上，我们仍必须继续研究资产阶级的哲学、社会科学、文学和艺术。对修正主义，也是如此。
    毒草是阻碍社会生产力的发展的。我们的社会科学——政治学、经济学、法学、教育学、新闻学等——必须为促进我国的社会生产力服务。我国的文学艺术，也必须为此服务。
    毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的演讲，是马克思列宁主义的重要发展。不论是革命或者建设，都必须打倒敌人，团结自己。毛主席指出了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾这两类矛盾，对不同性质的两类矛盾提出了辨别的方法和正确处理的方法，这给我们的社会科学、文学、艺术工作者指明了方向，因为在各门社会科学中和文学艺术中，都有如何辨别两类矛盾，和如何正确处理两类矛盾的问题。这篇演讲，对我们的“破”和“立”的工作的正确进行，起了指导作用。我建议大家把这篇演讲精读几遍，把人民出版社出版的“社会主义教育课程的阅读文件汇编”做一番研究，这对我们的工作会有很大好处。
    让我们大家努力，互相帮助，互相勉励，做促进派，不做促退派。让马克思列宁主义在学术领域中建立起巩固的领导地位。让我们的祖国很快地繁荣起来，富强起来！
