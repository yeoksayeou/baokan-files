The Sichuan Basin's Oil Reservoir
Li Ce, Wang Gongji

A few days ago, four oilfields were confirmed at Longnüsi between Nanchong, Yuechi and Wusheng in Sichuan, Penglai Town in Pengxi, and Huangguashan in Yongchuan, eastern Sichuan. From then on, the "Sichuan has no oil" theory, rampantly clamored by imperialists and right-wingers, was completely bankrupted.

Long ago, many oil springs and gas seeps were exposed in the Sichuan Basin. More than twenty years ago, our older generation of geologists searched for oil everywhere in the basin. During the Anti-Japanese War, the geological departments of the Kuomintang government also searched for oil everywhere. As a result, only two gas wells with extremely low production were found in Shiyougou, Ba County, and Shengdengshan, Longchang. At that time, American imperialist Nat King Cole was acting as Chiang Kai-shek's advisor. He and other imperialist so-called petroleum geology experts believed that the oil-bearing strata in Sichuan were exposed on the surface, and that the natural gas already found did not contain oil components, and concluded that "Sichuan has no oil at all." A few of our geologists with pro-American ideas believed this absurd argument and lost confidence in continuing to search for oil resources in Sichuan.

In the past five years, petroleum geological exploration personnel from the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, undaunted by difficulties and dangers, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, have carried out large-scale petroleum geological exploration work in most of the 180,000 square kilometers of the Sichuan Basin. They discovered 143 geological structures and drilled on 12 structures. By 1957, they had found five gas fields with industrial value. Initially, the petroleum drilling force was mainly concentrated in Jiangyou, Longquanyi, Longchang and other places in western and southern Sichuan. There were also oil shows on these geological structures. However, crude oil with industrial exploitation value could not be found for a while. At that time, how to find a large amount of oil flow in the Sichuan Basin had become a common concern for Chinese petroleum geologists.

In 1955, during a visit to the Soviet Union by the Chinese petroleum industry delegation, Soviet experts suggested that the Sichuan petroleum exploration team should immediately move to the central Sichuan platform. According to Soviet experience, the central Sichuan platform is a promising oil-bearing area. Russia's Second Baku was found on the platform. Subsequently, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry accepted the Soviet experts' suggestion and instructed the Sichuan petroleum exploration department to abandon those areas where oil resources were not easily obtained for the time being, and immediately mobilize the exploration team to turn to the central Sichuan platform. A few geological personnel at that time showed hesitation and lack of confidence in this measure. The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau Party Committee of the Communist Party of China rejected all objections and educated all employees to resolutely implement this decision of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau immediately withdrew the Jiangyou exploration team and transferred forces from other exploration areas to carry out large-scale drilling on the central Sichuan platform.

After moving to the central Sichuan platform, in just half a year, the largest oil area in inland China was discovered in the Sichuan Basin in early March this year. The Nanchong No. 3 well sprayed 172 tons of crude oil in the first 1.55 minutes of testing, and the oil peak was more than 30 meters high. This kind of oil spraying situation is unprecedented in the history of Chinese exploration. Now the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau is rapidly strengthening the drilling force to find out the effective oil storage area of ​​these three structures this year in preparation for development. Around the central Sichuan oil area, such as Hechuan, Yingshan, Guang'an, Qu County and other places, there are also crude oil shows in the structural drilling wells. The oil-bearing horizons and structural properties of these structures are consistent with those of the Nanchong, Longnüsi, and Penglai structures. This shows that a large amount of crude oil may also be found in these structures. In the future, the area of ​​the central Sichuan oil area will continue to expand. It is expected that the entire area from Huaying Mountain in the east, the foot of Daba Mountain in the north, and the Tuojiang River in the west will reach more than 40,000 square kilometers, accounting for about a quarter of the Sichuan Basin. At the same time, due to the large amount of oil spraying in the central Sichuan oil area, Sichuan petroleum explorers have also realized that the structures in the front mountain zone of Daba Mountain, Wolonghe east of Huaying Mountain and Shizhu and other places may also store a large amount of oil.

In March this year, Kang Shi'en, Vice Minister of Petroleum Industry, called on Sichuan petroleum explorers to "ask for oil from the Jurassic." Judging from the geological conditions of the central Sichuan oil area, the oil-bearing horizons are all in the Jurassic strata. Facts have proved that this scientific conclusion is completely correct. According to geological data, the Jurassic distribution area in the Sichuan Basin is very wide. In addition to the central Sichuan oil area, in the Jurassic strata of Huangguashan and Shiyougou in eastern Sichuan, Yanggaosi in southern Sichuan, and Guanxian, Jiangyou, and Dayi in western Sichuan, the Petroleum General Survey Team of the Ministry of Geology and Sichuan petroleum explorers have found crude oil.

The drilling results in recent years have proved that the petroleum in the Sichuan Basin not only has a wide oil storage area, but also has many oil storage horizons. Crude oil appears in the Jurassic Mindi formation at 300 to 800 meters; there are also good crude oil shows in the Jurassic or Triassic middle-deep formations at 1,000 meters or more, and in the Jurassic or Triassic deep formations at about 2,000 meters. Soviet Academy of Sciences Corresponding Academician Milchenko visited Sichuan in April 1957. According to the above data, he believed that there might be more primary petroleum storage in the Permian deep formations below 3,000 meters. Judging from the geological structure development and stratum distribution of the Sichuan Basin, it is very likely to become a large oil area in the world.

In just a few days in mid-March this year, the Sichuan petroleum exploration work underwent a sudden change. The central Sichuan oil area has jumped from the petroleum pre-exploration stage to the production and construction preparation stage. The continuous large-scale oil spraying from several exploration wells in the central Sichuan oil area within a short week has aroused widespread attention throughout the country. The central government and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry require the Petroleum Exploration Bureau to quickly find out the effective oil storage area of ​​the central Sichuan oil area this year and expand the exploration scope of the oil area. The specific plan for the major battle in the central Sichuan oil area this year has been rushed out overnight by the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau. A large number of geological and infrastructure personnel have come to the central Sichuan oil area from all over the country to sort out data and compile plans. Chief geologists are personally drawing maps, and the newly determined deep exploration wells have been increased to 117, and another 291 shallow wells will be added this year. The total workload for the whole year is preliminarily estimated to have increased by fourteen times compared with the original plan. Comrade Chernychev, a Soviet expert, provides guidance day and night. Materials and equipment are continuously transferred from all over the country to central Sichuan. The Sichuan local authorities mobilized a large number of vehicles, fully loaded with materials urgently needed for the project, speeding on the highways leading to the central Sichuan oil area. The Sichuan Highway Bureau decided to contract to build the highways in the oil area and maintain the existing highways and strengthen the bridges. Three road construction surveying teams are already conducting surveys in the oil area. Production preparations are also being stepped up. Oil refineries have begun preparations; small-scale refining equipment that meets current urgent needs is being designed. The railway trunk line connecting the central Sichuan oil area will soon be surveyed. Highways and telecommunications networks densely distributed in the oil area will be formed this year. …

In the spring of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, my country's petroleum industry construction has leaped into a new era. The central Sichuan oil area has decided to hand over tens of thousands of tons of crude oil to the country this year. After formal production next year, it is expected that the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau can complete the plan to produce 250,000 tons of crude oil in 1962 ahead of schedule within two or three years. In this way, it is possible for my country's petroleum industry to catch up with the United Kingdom in a shorter time than fifteen years.

    四川盆地的石油库
    李策　王功济
    前几天，在四川南充，岳池和武胜之间的龙女寺，蓬溪蓬莱镇和川东永川黄瓜山，证实了四个油田。从此，帝国主义者和右派分子猖狂叫嚣的“四川无油论”彻底破产了。
    在很早以前，四川盆地就露出了多处油泉和气苗。二十多年前，我国老辈的地质学家们，在盆地内到处寻找石油。抗日战争期间，国民党政府的地质部门也到处寻找石油。结果仅仅在巴县石油沟、隆昌圣灯山发现了两口产量极微的气井。当时美帝国主义分子纳奇正充当蒋介石的顾问，他和其他帝国主义的所谓石油地质专家，认为四川含油地层露出地面，已经找到的天然气不含油的成份，断定“四川根本没有石油”。我国少数具有崇美思想的地质学家迷信这一荒谬的论断，对继续在四川找寻石油资源失掉了信心。
    最近五年来，中央地质部和石油工业部的石油地质勘探人员，不避艰险，爬山涉水，在四川盆地十八万平方公里的大部分地区展开了大规模的石油地质勘探工作。他们发现了一百四十三个地质构造，在十二个构造上进行钻探，到1957年，就已找到五个具有工业价值的气田。开始，石油钻探力量主要集中在川西、川南的江油、龙泉山、隆昌等处，在这些地质构造上也有油的显示。但是一时还找不到具有工业开采价值的原油。当时，怎样在四川盆地找到大量油流，已经成为我国石油地质人员普遍关心的问题。
    1955年，我国石油工业代表团访问苏联期间，苏联专家建议四川石油勘探队伍应该立即走上川中地台。根据苏联的经验来看，川中地台是大有希望的储油地区。俄罗斯的第二巴库就是在地台上找到的。接着，石油工业部接受了苏联专家的建议，指示四川石油勘探部门放弃那些一时不易获得石油资源的地区，立即调动勘探队伍转向川中地台。少数地质人员当时对这一措施表现了迟疑不决，信心不足。中共四川石油勘探局党委拒绝了一切反对意见，教育全体职工坚决执行石油工业部的这项决定。四川石油勘探局立即撤出江油的勘探队伍，并从其他探区抽调力量在川中地台上展开了大规模的钻探。
    走上川中地台之后，仅仅半年光景，今年3月初就在四川盆地上发现了我国内地最大的油区。南充三号井在第一次放喷的一点五十五分钟内，喷出一百七十二吨原油，油峰高达三十公尺以上。这种喷油情况在我国勘探史上是空前未有的。现在四川石油勘探局正迅速加强钻探力量，要在今年内查明这三个构造的有效储油面积，作为开发的准备。川中油区的周围，如合川、营山、广安、渠县等地的构造钻井内，也有原油显示。这些构造的出油层位和构造性质，同南充、龙女寺、蓬莱三个构造是一致的。这说明在这些构造内也可能找到大量原油。将来川中油区的面积还会不断地扩大。预计东起华蓥山，北抵大巴山麓，西到沱江，全部面积将要达到四万多平方公里，约占四川盆地的四分之一。同时，由于川中油区大量喷油，也使四川石油勘探人员认识到在大巴山前山带，华蓥山以东的卧龙河和石砫等地的构造上，也有储积大量石油的可能。
    今年3月石油工业部副部长康世恩号召四川石油勘探人员“向侏罗纪要油”。从川中油区的地质情况来看，出油层位都在侏罗纪地层，事实已经证明这一科学论断是完全正确的。根据地质资料，四川盆地侏罗纪分布面积很广，除了川中油区外，在川东黄瓜山、石油沟，川南阳高寺，川西灌县、江油、大邑等地的侏罗纪地层内，地质部石油普查大队和四川石油勘探人员都找到了原油。
    几年来的钻探成果证明，四川盆地的石油，不仅储油面积广阔，而且储油层位较多。在三百到八百公尺的侏罗纪泯地层有原油出现；在一千公尺以上的侏罗纪或三迭纪的中深地层，以及在两千公尺左右的侏罗纪或三迭纪深地层也有很好的原油显示。苏联科学院通讯院士米尔琴柯在1957年4月来四川访问期间，根据以上资料，认为在三千公尺以下的二迭纪深地层，可能还有更多的原生石油储积。从四川盆地的地质构造发育和地层分布的情况来看，它很有可能成为世界上一个大油区。
    今年3月中旬的短短几天内，四川石油勘探工作发生了突然的变化。川中油区已经从石油预探阶段跃进到生产建设准备阶段。川中油区几口探井在短短一周内连续大量喷油，已引起全国各地普遍的重视。中央以及石油工业部要求石油勘探局在今年迅速查明川中油区的有效储油面积，并扩大油区的勘探范围。今年大战川中油区的具体规划已由四川石油勘探局连夜赶制出来。大批地质、基建人员纷纷从各地来到川中油区整理资料编制计划。总地质师们亲自动手绘图，新确定的深探井增加到了一百一十七口，今年还要增加二百九十一口浅井。全年的工作量初步估计已经比原订计划增加十四倍右左。苏联专家切尔尼晓夫同志不分昼夜地进行指导。器材和设备源源从各地向川中调来。四川地方当局调动大批车辆，满载着工程急需的物资在通往川中油区的各条公路上奔驰。四川公路局决定包干修筑油区的公路和现有公路的维护以及桥梁加固工作。三支筑路的测量队已经在油区进行勘测。生产的准备工作也在加紧进行。炼油厂已开始筹备；适应目前迫切需要的小型炼油设备正着手设计。贯通川中油区的铁路干线不久将要进行勘察。密布油区内的公路和电讯网，在今年内就要形成。……
    在第二个五年计划第一年的春天，我国石油工业建设跃进到一个崭新的时代。今年川中油区就决定给国家交出上万吨的原油。明年正式生产以后，预计在两三年内，四川石油勘探局可以提前完成1962年年产二十五万吨原油的计划。这样，我国石油工业就有可能在比十五年更短的时间内赶上英国。
