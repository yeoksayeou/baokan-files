　　“Ge Xu” and “Sacrificing to the Community”

　　The Zhuang People's "Ge Xu"
　　The Zhuang people deeply love singing. The Zhuang people in the Zuojiang and Youjiang areas of Guangxi also have singing festivals called "Ge Xu." "Ge Xu" is generally held on the fifteenth day of the first month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the twelfth day of the fifth month of each year. During the "Ge Xu" period, young men and women dress up and go to the meeting to sing and have fun collectively. The number of participants ranges from hundreds to over ten thousand. Often singing goes on all night long. Those who are good at singing can often improvise songs and answer fluently; a few places also have activities such as "throwing embroidered balls" and "snatching firecrackers." Through these activities, young men and women can express their love for each other and exchange gifts. Li Fu's "Guangxi Tongzhi" has a vivid description of "Ge Xu": "Young women, in groups of three or five in the spring, gather fragrant flowers and pick verdant plants on mountain slopes and by the water's edge, singing for joy, and young men also gather in groups of three or five, responding with songs, singing back and forth, until the end of the day..."

　　The Yao People's "Sacrificing to the Community"
　　The custom of "sacrificing to the community" is widely prevalent in the Yao Autonomous County of Dayao Mountain in Guangxi. Sacrificing to the community is a collective sacrificial rite, and what is meant by sacrificing to the community is sacrificing to the God of the Community. It is sacrificed twice a year, in the second and eighth months of the lunar calendar, on the "Community Day," and all residents sharing the same community must participate. On the day of sacrificing to the community, in addition to slaughtering pigs for sacrifice, the community elder, who is usually responsible for cleaning the community temple, appears as the leader. Each household sends one person to the community temple for a communal meal and to listen to the community elder's "material words." During the "material words," the community elder announces regulations related to production, as well as prohibitions against all activities harmful to production or hindering the interests of others during production.

    “歌圩”和“祭社”
      智　明　王缉国
      僮族“歌圩”
    僮族人民酷爱唱歌。广西左、右江一带的僮族人民还有叫做“歌圩”唱歌的节日。“歌圩”一般在每年的正月十五、三月初三、四月初八、五月十二举行。每逢“歌圩”期，青年男女都要盛装赴会，集体唱歌作乐。参加的人数，由数百人到万余人不等。往往歌唱通宵达旦。善歌的人，多能出口成歌，对答如流；少数地方同时有“抛绣球”、“抢花炮”的活动。通过这些活动，男女青年可以互相表示爱慕，互相赠送礼物。李绂纂的“广西通志”上对“歌圩”有一段生动的描绘：“少妇于春时三五为伴，采芳拾翠于山椒水湄，歌唱为乐，少男亦三五为群，歌以赴之，一唱一和，竟日乃已……”。
      瑶族的“祭社”
    广西大瑶山瑶族自治县普遍流行着“祭社”的习俗。祭社是一种集体祭典，所谓祭社就是祭社王。每年旧历二、八两月的“社日”各祭一次，凡是共一个社的居民都要参加。祭社这天，除杀猪祭祀外，平时负责打扫社庙的社老就以领袖的身分出现。各户各派一人到社庙前聚餐，听社老“料话”。“料话”时，社老就宣布有关生产的规约，以及宣布禁止一切对生产有害的和在生产时妨碍别人利益的活动。
