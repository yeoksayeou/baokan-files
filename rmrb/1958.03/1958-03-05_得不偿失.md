    Penny Wise, Pound Foolish
    A large amount of wool shipped from all over the country to Tianjin for export is lost due to poor packaging, resulting in significant losses. The Tianjin Animal By-Products Company's wool processing plant picks up a lot of wool each time it transports wool packages from various places from the station, both in the storage area and during transportation. In the second half of last year alone, they picked up more than 10,000 jin.
    The main reason for the scattered packaging is that the allocating units use broken straw sacks and rotten straw ropes for packaging to save on packaging costs, which cannot withstand the friction of long-distance transportation. The losses caused by neglecting packaging quality are greater than the packaging costs saved. It is hoped that all allocating units will improve packaging quality in the future to prevent scattered packages. (Su Peixiang)

    得不偿失
    全国各地运到天津出口的绒毛，由于包装不好，大量绒毛漏掉，损失很大。天津畜产公司绒毛加工厂，每次从车站运搬各地调来的绒毛包时，都在存放场地和运搬途中拾得不少的绒毛，仅去年下半年就拾得一万多斤。
    造成包装散包的原因，主要是调拨单位为了节约包装费用，用破草袋、烂草绳包装捆结，经不起长途运载的磨擦。由于忽视包装质量造成的损失比节省下来的包装费还要大。希望各调拨单位今后提高包装质量，防止散包。（苏培祥）
