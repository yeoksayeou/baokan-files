    Great Leap Forward Short Verses
　　Meng Chao
      Production targets, production targets, like a mercury column, keep rising and rising! Morning is still early spring, noon becomes blazing summer. Everyone knows that the scale of temperature marks thermal expansion and contraction; the heart seems to be navigating in the rapids of the equator, surging and nothing can resist it!
    People who climb stairs People who are used to climbing stairs only move forward step by step; if they walk too fast, their hearts will have asthma, and their feet will tremble. The times are no longer what they used to be, it is like taking an elevator up the mountain; even if you have many concerns, watch us fly to the top of the Himalayas!

    大跃进短曲
　　孟超
      生产指标生产指标像水银柱，一个劲儿往上涨；清晨还是初春，中午就变成了炎夏。谁都知道温度的刻表度，标志着热涨冷缩；心似在赤道的急流中航渡，滚腾起来甚么也抵挡不住！
    爬楼梯的人爬惯楼梯的人，只会一级级按步向前；走急了他心脏哮喘，脚底下哆嗦着直发软。时代已不像从前，好似坐升降机上山；你尽管顾虑多端，看我们飞到喜马拉雅顶巅！
