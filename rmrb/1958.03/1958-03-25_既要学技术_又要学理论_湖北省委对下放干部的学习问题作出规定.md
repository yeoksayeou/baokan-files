Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 23rd: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is concerned about the learning of over 80,000 transferred cadres across the province and recently issued instructions outlining several regulations on this matter.

The Hubei Provincial Committee requires that units with transferred cadres should, where conditions permit, establish technical night schools or technical research groups for the transferred cadres. Integrating with production, these should conduct planned learning of production knowledge and basic scientific knowledge. The aim is to enable all transferred cadres to learn one or several production skills based on the principle of "learning what you do," striving to reach the level of a junior technician in one to one and a half years, and the level of a middle-level technician in three years.

The Hubei Provincial Committee stipulates that all transferred cadres should study current events and policies. Transferred cadres with a junior high school education should participate in the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. All transferred cadres participating in political theory study should, like cadres working in government offices, participate in the fourth stage of rectification and the subsequent socialist education courses.

To ensure that transferred cadres have time to study, the Hubei Provincial Committee stipulates that three days of production time should be set aside each month for political theory study for transferred cadres. As for the professional practice of transferred professional cadres and the cultural studies of transferred cadres whose educational level is below junior high school, these should be carried out during spare time.

The Hubei Provincial Committee requires that each transferred cadre, while formulating a production plan, should also formulate a learning plan based on the unified arrangements of the local Party organization, local conditions, and their personal circumstances and needs, and conduct regular check-ups.

The Hubei Provincial Committee also stipulates that Party organizations in each unit should assign specific personnel to manage the learning of transferred cadres and select appropriate personnel from among the transferred cadres to serve as tutors. Party and government leaders at all levels who visit transferred cadres in the countryside are responsible for giving reports to the transferred cadres and answering questions.

    既要学技术　又要学理论
    湖北省委对下放干部的学习问题作出规定
    新华社武汉23日电　中共湖北省委关心全省八万多下放干部的学习问题，日前发出指示，对此作了几项规定。
    湖北省委要求有下放干部的单位，凡是有条件的，都应该为下放干部举办技术夜校或技术研究组，结合生产，有计划进行生产知识和科学基本知识的学习。使所有下放干部在“做什么学什么”的原则下，学会一门或几门生产技术知识，争取在一年或一年半时间里达到初级技术员的水平，三年达到中级技术员的水平。
    中共湖北省委规定所有下放干部都应该学习时事政策。具有初中文化程度的下放干部，参加马克思列宁主义理论学习；所有参加政治理论学习的下放干部，还应该和在机关工作的干部一样，一律参加第四阶段的整风，并参加以后开始的社会主义教育课程的学习。
    为了保证下放干部有时间进行学习，湖北省委规定，每月抽出三天生产时间，作为下放干部的政治理论学习时间。至于下放的专业干部的专业练习以及文化水平不到初中程度的下放干部的文化学习，应利用业余时间进行。
    湖北省委要求每个下放干部，在制订生产计划的同时，应该根据当地党组织的统一布置、当地条件以及个人的具体情况和需要，作出学习方面的规划，并定期检查。
    湖北省委还规定，各单位党组织应有专人负责管理下放干部的学习，并从下放干部中挑选适当的人员担任辅导工作。下乡探望下放干部的各级党政负责人，有责任向下放干部作报告并解答问题。
