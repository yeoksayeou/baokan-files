    首都戏剧音乐界的跃进规划
    苦干一年作品上万
    剧本七千一　乐曲三千二　多中求精　量中求质
    本报特约新华社5日讯  北京戏剧、音乐界提出了苦干一年，创作、改编、整理七千一百多个剧本和三千二百多个音乐作品的大跃进规划，并向全国文艺界发起友谊竞赛。
    这个规划是北京戏剧、音乐界在3日到5日举行的创作会议上制定的。中国京剧院决定今年创作、改编、整理四百个剧本，并把“白毛女”改成京剧。北京人民艺术剧院提出今年创作各种剧本四百五十个，演出九百五十场，并给国家上缴利润五万五千元。中国青年艺术剧院提出今年创作三百六十个剧本。中央实验歌剧院像大会报喜说：这个剧院今年将发动院内外力量创作大小歌舞剧和音乐作品一千三百七十九个，其中保证三分之二能演能用。中央乐团计划今年创作八百三十个各种作品。中国人民解放军总政治部文工团所属各团也以全年创作各种作品二千零二十六件向全国兄弟团体挑战。北京市所属各戏曲剧团决定今年创作改编一千九百五十八个剧本，比去年增加十五倍。会议期间上海京剧院、辽宁人民艺术剧院以及武汉、天津等地戏剧音乐界的代表都发言表示应战。
    许多著名剧作家和音乐家还进行了个人之间的挑战和应战。剧作家田汉表示他今年要写出十个剧本，剧作家老舍、夏衍、阳翰笙、曹禺、陈其通等都表示要积极赶上。
    剧作家、音乐家在发言中谈到，要使创作又多又好又快又省，要做到多中求精、量中求质；既有干劲、又有办法。制定创作规划以后，就需要从各方面采取一系列的措施来促其实现，并保证质量。
  中共中央宣传部文艺处处长林默涵在讲话中，希望戏剧家、音乐家促进社会主义文艺事业的发展。
