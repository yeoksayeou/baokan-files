Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th - Labor Secretary Mitchell announced on the 11th that US unemployment in February reached 5.2 million, an increase of nearly 700,000 from January of this year, reaching a 16-year high.

A statement from the Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce said that this figure accounts for 6.7% of the total US workforce, which is higher than the percentage during the 1954 recession. The surge in unemployment is mainly due to the continued increase in unemployment in the automobile, hardware, electrical machinery, and machine industries.

The surge in unemployment has alarmed the US government. President Eisenhower convened a meeting of Republican congressional leaders on the same day to discuss ways to cope with the increase in unemployment. According to Republican House Leader Martin after the meeting, Eisenhower even discussed the possibility of using tax cuts to ease the economic recession. But he said the government is not prepared to make a decision on this measure immediately, and will wait until next month to see the situation before making a decision.

Some American economists believe that tax cuts will not be effective in the current economic recession, and will not benefit the vast number of unemployed workers because they have no taxes to pay at all. At the same time, they also pointed out that if tax cuts are indeed implemented, it will further reduce government tax revenue, thereby increasing its financial difficulties.

The current number of unemployed people in the United States has increased by two million compared with the same period last year, including 1.3 million in the manufacturing sector, 300,000 in the construction industry, and an increase in unemployment in other transportation sectors, especially the railway transportation sector.

    美失业人数登上十六年来最高峰
    二月份达到五百二十万
    艾森豪威尔政府惊惶失措一筹莫展
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国劳工部长密契尔11日宣布，2月份美国的失业人数达到五百二十万人，比今年1月份增加了近七十万人，达到十六年来的最高峰。
    劳工部和商务部在一项声明中说，这个数字占美国全部劳动力的6.7％，比1954年经济衰退期间所占的百分比还要高。失业激增的主要原因是汽车、五金、电机和机器工业的失业人数继续增加。
    失业人数的激增引起了美国政府的惊恐。总统艾森豪威尔同一天召集国会共和党领袖举行会议，讨论应付失业增加的办法。据共和党众议院领袖马丁在会后透露，会上艾森豪威尔同他们甚至讨论了用减税来缓和经济衰退的可能性。但是他说，政府不准备马上就这一措施采取决定，它要等到下个月看看情况再作决定。
    美国一些经济人士认为，减税并不能对目前的经济衰退起有效的作用，也不会对广大的失业工人有好处，因为他们根本就无税可付。同时，他们还指出，如果真的实行减税，将使政府的税收进一步减少，从而增加它的财政困难。
    美国现在的失业人数比去年同期增加了二百万，其中制造业部门增加了一百三十万，建筑工业部门增加了三十万，其他运输部门，特别是铁路运输部门的失业人数也增加了。（附图片）
