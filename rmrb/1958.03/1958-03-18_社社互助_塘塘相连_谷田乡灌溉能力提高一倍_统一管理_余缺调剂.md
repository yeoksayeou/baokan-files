    Mutual Aid Between Cooperatives, Ponds Connected
    Irrigation Capacity of Gutian Township Doubles
    Unified Management, Surplus and Deficit Adjustment
    (Reported by this newspaper) Since last winter, the eleven agricultural cooperatives in Gutian Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, have adopted the method of "mutual aid between cooperatives, ponds connected, unified management, surplus and deficit adjustment," which has effectively improved the irrigation capacity of existing ponds and reservoirs. The irrigated area has been expanded by about one-fold compared to the original, ensuring irrigation for all 1,100+ mu of paddy fields. Self-flowing irrigation has also increased from 30% to 90% of the total field area.
    These eleven adjacent agricultural cooperatives are located in the shallow hilly area of Gutian Township. Since last winter, each cooperative has built four ponds and reservoirs, adding to the original ponds and reservoirs making a total of twenty-seven. Judging from the water storage capacity of these ponds, strengthening organization and management can irrigate the eleven cooperatives' 1,100+ mu of paddy fields. However, because most of these ponds and reservoirs were built by individual cooperatives, and their water sources and storage capacities were different, the potential could not be fully utilized, and the actual irrigated area was half of the possible irrigated area.
    After the socialist education movement, the collective consciousness of township and cooperative cadres and the masses has been enhanced. They realize that mutual cooperation and support can promote common leaps forward. Under the leadership of the township Party branch, they broke down the boundaries of cooperatives, connected the ponds that could be connected with channels, and adjusted surpluses and deficits; they also divided the irrigated fields into sections and supplied water according to plan.
    According to this method, only nine main canals need to be dug, costing about 1,000 workdays, to expand irrigation by more than 500 mu of fields; to build water conservancy facilities with the same irrigation capacity would require about 10,000 workdays and a longer time. Currently, three of the nine canals have been completed, and the other six will be completed before the summer rainy season.

    社社互助  塘塘相连
    谷田乡灌溉能力提高一倍
    统一管理  余缺调剂
    本报讯  四川资中县谷田乡的十一个农业社采取了“社社互助、塘塘相连、统一管理、余缺调剂”的办法，有效地提高了现有塘堰的灌溉能力，灌溉面积比原来扩大约一倍，使一千一百多亩水田全部有了水利保证。自流灌溉的水田也由占总田面积30％增至90％。
    这十一个相邻的农业社位于谷田乡的浅丘陵地区。各社去冬以来，兴修了四个塘堰，加上原有塘堰已有二十七个。从这些塘的蓄水能力看，加强组织管理，可以灌溉十一个社的一千一百多亩水田。但由于这些塘堰大多是以社为单位兴修的，这些塘堰水源、蓄水能力又各不相同，潜力不能发挥，实际灌溉面积比可能灌溉的少一半。
    经过社会主义教育运动，乡社干部和群众的集体观念增强，认识到互相协作，彼此支援，才能一起跃进。他们在乡党支部的领导下，打破社的界限，用渠道把能够相连的塘连接起来，余缺相济；并将灌田分片划段，按计划供水。
    按照这个办法，只需挖九条干渠，约花一千个工，就能扩灌五百多亩田；而要兴修同样灌溉能力的水利设施，就需要花一万左右个工，还需要较长的时间。现在，九条渠道已完成三条，另六条在夏天雨季前完成。
