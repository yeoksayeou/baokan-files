The Land of Fish and Rice on the Bohai Beach
By our reporter Jin Feng

A wasteland that had been dormant for tens of millions of years has awakened. It stretched its body, extended its arms, and sent over 100 million jin of grain to the human world...

The Cangxian Special District in Hebei Province is located east of the Bohai Sea, with over 3 million mu of reclaimable wasteland, accounting for about one-eighth of its total area. The cultivated land in this special district has poor soil quality, and the per-mu yield of grain is very low, with production falling short of demand. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sales, the state has needed to supply an average of 220 million jin of grain each year for four grain years. In particular, Huanghua County, which is located on the coast, has a sparse population and concentrated wasteland, with a total area of 4.4 million mu, of which over 2 million mu is wasteland. Here, nature generously endowed the land but was stingy in providing grain. Each mu only produced 98 jin of grain, and the state had to supply 30 to 40 million jin of grain each year.

Farmers had long come to this vast wasteland, selecting land with good soil quality to cultivate. However, they couldn't withstand the spring droughts and autumn floods, the soil alkalization, and even more so, the plundering and exploitation by the "wahu zi" (landlords) and sea bandits. Thus, for many years, on this 880,000-mu wasteland in Beidagang, Huanghua County, only six small black-dot-like villages were scattered, with a total of just over 7,100 mu of cultivated land. Even this piece of cultivated land was soaked with the blood and sweat of the farmers.

In 1949, the Cangxian Special District established a state-owned farm in Huanghua County, bringing in several tractors to deal with the million-mu wasteland east of the city. From 1949 to 1951, for three whole years, only 20,000 mu of land were reclaimed, planted with soybeans and sorghum. However, the problem of water was not solved, and the land was not leached or pressed to remove the alkali, so the seedlings did not grow fully. Land reclamation failed, and people and machines were gradually transferred away.

Successful Trial Planting of 100 Mu of Rice

In 1952, the small Shanggulin Village in the northeast of Beidagang, with 23 households, formed the first fully socialist cooperative in the entire special district. In 1953, the cooperative was consolidated and expanded, and the socialist path brought people the courage and determination to conquer nature. Tang Yuping, the Party branch secretary of Shanggulin Village, was the first to propose the idea of reclaiming wasteland to grow rice.

"Growing rice in alkaline wasteland? Isn't that nonsense?" Many people exclaimed in surprise.

Tang Yuping directed everyone's attention to the north. Twenty li north of the village is Xiaozhan in the suburbs of Tianjin, which produces the nationally famous "Xiaozhan Rice." In the past, that was also a piece of alkaline wasteland, and the elderly can still remember that it was reclaimed by the garrison troops there at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Tang Yuping asked everyone: Can't we, who are following the socialist path under the leadership of the Communist Party, do what some garrison troops could do in the feudal era?

Everyone agreed with Tang Yuping's idea. But difficulties came one after another. How could they buy farm tools without money for reclamation, and what should they do if they didn't understand rice planting techniques? They overcame numerous difficulties with perseverance and sowed the seeds of a happy life on the saline-alkali wasteland for the first time. When the rice was flowering and bearing fruit, due to the low water level in the port, it could not be irrigated by gravity. Seeing most of the green rice seedlings turn yellow, the cooperative members were very anxious, worried that they had worked hard for nothing. At this time, the Party branch mobilized Party members to lead all cooperative members to dig a large ditch from the port in two days and nights to draw water and irrigate the rice fields. The rice seedlings quickly became lush. In the autumn, the 100 mu of rice that was trial-planted achieved the first harvest with a yield of 300 jin per mu!

Over 10,000 Young Adults March Towards the Wasteland

In 1955, they reclaimed and expanded rice planting to 1,000 mu, and again achieved a harvest of 400 jin per mu.

That winter, the entire special district welcomed the high tide of advanced cooperativization, and the conditions for large-scale land reclamation matured.

The Cangxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that the land reclamation of the Shanggulin Cooperative was a successful path.

The Prefectural Committee decided that cooperatives in the entire special district with more labor and less land should send volunteers to reclaim the wasteland, and each county should establish one or two cooperatives there as branches of the cooperatives of all the reclamation team members sent by the county; the profits should be distributed to the old cooperatives after the autumn harvest, people should be drawn from the old cooperatives, and livestock, vehicles, farm tools, seeds, and even food should all come from the old cooperatives.

At the end of 1955, cooperatives in more than 5,000 villages in 15 of the 18 counties and cities in Cangxian Special District selected more than 16,000 reclamation team members. They came to the Bohai beach with livestock, farm tools, and seeds.

On the day they arrived, snow fell all over the sky. The northwest wind howled, and the waves rolled in the sea. There were no houses, no heated brick beds. The girls' bodies, hair, and eyebrows were covered with snowflakes. The Party and Youth League branches launched Party and Youth League members to take the lead in building makeshift shelters in the wind and snow, and also put forward the slogan "Starting a business on the wasteland, heroes are not afraid of the cold, and demand grain from the wasteland" to all reclamation team members. The work team and visiting group sent by the Prefectural Committee, as well as the county Party secretaries and county heads, also arrived in time to help them solve specific difficulties. The team members' morale stabilized, and they began the intense labor of digging ditches and digging the ground in the freezing weather. Regardless of their hands and feet freezing and cracking, they turned over the land that had not seen sunlight for thousands of years. Thousands of crisscrossing ditches appeared, as if installing a system of circulating blood vessels on the wasteland, and the wasteland began to awaken. At the same time, tens of thousands of migrant workers built a 60-li-long sea dike on the east side of Beidagang, blocking the port's entrance to the sea. Beidagang became a large reservoir that can store 400 million cubic meters of water and irrigate 250,000 mu of land. The farmers said happily, "This is not storing water, but storing sesame oil!" Spring came, the channels were built, and the sweet water of Beidagang flowed along the channels into the reclaimed land. Again and again, the sweet water flowed through the saline-alkali land, and the alkali in the land was washed away with the water, or sunk deep into the strata. The saline-alkali wasteland was thus turned into fertile paddy fields, planted with lush green rice seedlings.

The harvest season arrived. The Beidagang Reclamation Area planted 45,500 mu of rice, with an average yield of more than 520 jin per mu, producing a total of more than 23.99 million jin of rice. People finally ate the snow-white "Xiaozhan Rice" they grew on the wasteland.

Wasteland Becomes a Little Jiangnan

In 1956 and 1957, the Cangxian Special District reclaimed a total of 840,000 mu of wasteland, and 685,000 mu were put into production one after another, with a total income of more than 130 million jin of grain, more than 800,000 jin of cotton, and other crops converted into more than 3 million yuan. Thirty-two reclamation branches and thirteen new villages were established in the wasteland, and thirteen villages were expanded. This wasteland, which had been dormant for tens of millions of years, finally fully awakened. You see, it just stretched its body and extended its arms, and sent hundreds of millions of jin of grain to the human world.

The Cangxian Special District, which had historically been short of grain, sold 100 million jin of surplus grain to the state in 1957, of which Huanghua County sold more than 30 million jin. In Huanghua, which previously had a per-mu yield of 98 jin, the Shajingzi Mutual Aid Society emerged, which reclaimed wasteland and grew rice with a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin. This society reclaimed 9,000 mu of rice last year, with an average yield of 1,023 jin per mu. Together with sideline income, the society's total income was 1.18 million yuan, truly becoming a "millionaire." Each work day was divided into 5.9 yuan, and each laborer received an average of more than 900 yuan, with the highest receiving 1,400 yuan. In the past, this village almost entirely relied on the state for food rations, but last year it sold 7.2 million jin of surplus grain to the state, and the society also retained 600,000 jin of reserve grain. The cooperative members called this huge change "ascending to heaven in one step."

Now, the population of Beidagang has increased from more than 5,000 to more than 20,000, and the six villages have become five townships. Many of the reclamation team members have changed from single individuals to households. Electric lights, roads, supply and marketing cooperatives, clinics, bank business offices, film projection teams, and schools have appeared on the wasteland. Every household eats rice and cooks fish soup. The bitter and cold wasteland has become a land of fish and rice like Jiangnan!

The Cangxian Special District has summarized the experience of land reclamation in the past two years, and compared two methods of land reclamation: one is to establish state-owned farms, which requires large state investment and high costs (about 30 yuan for each mu of land reclamation); but the work is easy to do, and the proportion of commercial grain is large. The other method is to mobilize agricultural production cooperatives to organize volunteer land reclamation teams to run branch societies, and the land reclamation society and the old society uniformly distribute income (generally after two years, they can be separated). This method requires less state investment (a total of more than 1 million yuan is spent on water conservancy projects such as opening canals), and the cost is small (the cost per mu is more than 10 yuan). Land is reclaimed and benefits are obtained in the same year. This year, the Cangxian Special District plans to immigrate another 20,000 people, plus farms and sporadic land reclamation, to reclaim another 1 million mu.

The Cangxian Special District has more than 3 million mu of wasteland, which will be completely reclaimed during the Second Five-Year Plan period. By then, Huanghua County alone can hand over 1.5 billion jin of surplus grain to the state, which is equal to the current grain shortage in the entire Hebei Province. This is an ideal that even the most daring dreamers dared not imagine a year ago, and it will become a wonderful reality in five years!

    渤海滩上的鱼米之乡
    本报记者　金凤
    沉睡了千万年的荒滩苏醒了。她欠伸了一下身体，舒展了一下胳膊，就给人间送出一亿几千万斤粮食……
    河北省沧县专区东临渤海，可垦荒地有三百多万亩，约占总面积八分之一。这个专区耕地土质瘠薄，粮食亩产量很低，产不足用。自实行统购统销以后，四个粮食年度平均每年需国家供应二亿二千万斤粮食。特别是滨海的黄骅县，地广人稀，荒地集中，总面积四百四十万亩，荒地有二百多万亩。在这里，大自然慷慨地给予了土地，却吝啬付出粮食。每亩仅产粮食九十八斤，每年要国家供应三四千万斤粮食。
    农民很早就曾来到这一片茫茫的荒滩，挑选土质好的土地开垦耕种。但是挡不住春旱秋涝，土地碱化，更挡不住洼虎子（地主）和海匪的劫掠和剥削。这样，多少年来，在黄骅县北大港这一片八十八万亩的荒滩上，只散布着六个小黑点似的村庄，一共才开辟了七千一百多亩荒地。就是这一片耕地，也浸透了农民的血汗与白骨。
    1949年沧县专区在黄骅县办起一个国营农场，开来几部拖拉机，准备对付城东那一百来万亩荒地。从1949年到1951年，整整三年，才开出二万来亩土地，种上了大豆和高粱。但是，没有解决水的问题，土地没有洗碱和压碱，长不全苗。开荒失败了，人和机器陆续都调走了。
    试种百亩水稻成功
    1952年，北大港东北小小的上古林村，有二十三户组成了全专区第一个全社会主义性质的合作社。1953年，合作社巩固、扩大了，社会主义的道路给人们带来征服自然的勇气和决心。上古林村支部书记唐玉平第一个提出开荒种稻子的建议。
    “荒碱地里种水稻，这不是胡闹吗？”许多人惊讶地叫起来。
    唐玉平让大伙的眼光看看他们的北方。村北二十里的地方，就是天津市郊区的小站，那儿出产的“小站稻米”全国闻名。过去，那边也是一片荒碱洼地，老年人还能记得起是清朝末年的屯军在那里开的荒。唐玉平问大伙：难道封建时代一些屯军能做到的事，咱们在共产党领导下奔社会主义道路的人还做不到吗？
    大伙全同意了唐玉平的主意。但困难也就一个接一个的来了。开荒没钱买农具，不懂种稻技术怎么办呢？他们以坚韧不拔的毅力克服了重重困难，第一个在盐碱荒滩上撒下幸福生活的种籽。水稻在开花结实的时候，由于港内水位低不能自流灌溉，眼看绿油油的稻秧大部分变成枯黄，社员们非常焦急，担心白辛苦了一年。这时党支部动员党员带动全体社员，用两昼夜的时间从港内挖了一条大沟，把水引出来，用吸水机浇稻田。稻秧很快地茂盛起来了。秋后，试种的一百亩水稻，以亩产三百斤获得了第一次丰收！
    万余青壮年向荒滩进军
    1955年他们开荒扩种一千亩水稻，又获得亩产四百斤的收成。
    这年冬天，全专区迎接了高级合作化高潮，大面积开荒的条件成熟了。
    中共沧县地委认为：上古林合作社的开荒，是一条成功的道路。
    地委决定：全专区劳力多、地少的合作社，每社都派出志愿去垦荒的社员向荒地大进军，每个县到那儿办一、二个合作社，作为这个县所有派出垦荒队员的合作社的分社；秋后分红回老社分，人从老社拔，牲口、车辆、农具、种籽以至口粮都从老社出。
    在1955年年底，沧县专区十八个县、市中就有十五个县、市五千多个村庄的合作社选拔出一万六千多名垦荒队员。他们带着牲口、农具和种籽来到了渤海滩。
    他们刚到的那天，就撒下漫天风雪。西北风呼呼地吹，海浪在大海中翻滚。没有房子，没有热炕。姑娘们身上、头发上、眉毛上都盖满了雪花。党、团支部一面发动党、团员带头冒风雪突击搭窝棚，一面又向全体垦荒队员提出了：“在荒地上起家，好汉不怕天寒地冻，向荒地要粮食”的行动口号。地委派来工作组和慰问团，县委书记和县长们也及时赶到，帮助他们解决具体困难。队员们情绪稳定下来，在冰天雪地开始了挖渠、掘地的紧张劳动。他们不顾手冻脚裂，把几千年没见过阳光的土地翻过身来。千万条纵横贯通的沟渠出现了，仿佛给荒滩安装上周身流通的血管，荒滩开始苏醒过来。同时，上万名民工又在北大港东面修起六十里长的海堤，把港口入海处堵住。北大港就成为能蓄水四亿公方、浇地二十五万亩的大水库。农民们都乐呵呵地说：“这不是蓄的水，是蓄的香油！”春天来了，渠道修成了，北大港的甜水顺着渠道流入开垦出来的土地。一遍，又一遍，甜水流过了盐碱地，地里的碱随水洗去，或沉入地层深处。盐碱荒地就这样变成了肥沃的水田，插上绿油油的秧苗。
    收割的时候到了。北大港垦区种稻四万五千五百亩，平均亩产五百二十多斤，共产稻二千三百九十九万多斤。人们终于吃上自己在荒地上种的雪白的“小站稻米”。
    荒滩变成小江南
    1956年和1957年，沧县专区共垦荒八十四万亩，六十八万五千亩先后投入生产，共收入粮食一亿三千多万斤，棉花八十多万斤，其他作物折款三百多万元。在荒滩建立了三十二个垦荒分社、十三个新村，又扩建了十三个村庄。这沉睡了千万年的荒滩终于完全苏醒了。你看她只是欠伸了一下身体，舒展了一下胳膊，就给人间送出亿万斤粮食。
    历史上缺粮的沧县专区，1957年卖给国家余粮一亿斤，其中黄骅县就卖出三千多万斤。就在以前亩产九十八斤的黄骅，出现了垦荒种稻亩产千斤的沙井子互助社。这个社去年开荒种水稻九千亩，平均亩产一千零二十三斤。连同副业收入，全社总收入一百十八万元，真正成为“百万富翁”了。每个劳动日分五元九角，平均每个劳动力分九百元以上，最高的分到一千四百元。过去这个村几乎全靠国家供应口粮，去年卖给国家七百二十万斤余粮，社里还留六十万斤储备粮。社员对这种巨大的变化，称为“一步登天”。
    现在，北大港人口，由五千多人增加到二万多人，六个村变为五个乡，垦荒队员很多由单人变为一户。荒滩上出现了电灯、马路、供销社、诊疗所、银行营业所、电影放映队和学校。家家户户都吃上大米，熬鱼汤。苦寒的荒滩成为江南的鱼米之乡！
    沧县专区总结了这两年垦荒的经验，比较了两种垦荒的办法：一是建立国营农场，这种办法国家投资大，成本高（每亩垦荒费约三十多元）；但是工作好做，商品粮食比率大。另一个办法是发动农业生产合作社组织志愿垦荒队办分社，垦荒社与老社统一分配收益（一般经过二年即可分开）。这种办法国家投资少（连开渠等水利工程共花一百多万元），成本小（每亩费用十余元），当年开荒，当年受益。今年沧县专区准备再移民二万，加上农场及零星开荒，再垦荒一百万亩。
    沧县专区三百多万亩荒地，在第二个五年计划期间将要全部开垦出来。到那时，黄骅县一个县就可以交给国家十五亿斤余粮，等于目前河北省全省的缺粮数。这是一年以前连最大胆的梦想家也不敢想像的理想，五年以后就将成为美妙的事实！
