Every Household Builds Cars, Everyone Repairs Roads
    Qianjin Cooperative Achieves "Vehicle-ization"

    Xinhua News Agency

    In Hengxiao Township, Ninghua County, Fujian Province, the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative, inspired by the lead of cooperative leader Wu Liangyi and others in manufacturing six wooden-wheeled handcarts, launched a wave of every household building cars and everyone repairing roads. At a total cost of just over thirty yuan, they achieved "vehicle-ization" in seven days. As a result, the entire cooperative can save more than 20,000 labor days of carrying and transporting per year.

    In seven days, they widened and leveled eleven large field roads. Using old wooden crates, wooden poles, old doors, broken bed frames, and locally produced Holland wood, they manufactured 162 wooden-wheeled handcarts, each costing only two jiao for iron nails. The agricultural cooperative originally planned to spend 30,000 yuan to build a large bridge, but later, with suggestions and contributions of labor and materials from the members, they rebuilt a pontoon bridge, spending only three jin of iron nails and more than ten labor days.

    家家造车人人修路
    前进社车子化
    福建省宁化县横销乡前进农业社家家造车、人人修路，共总花了三十多元，七天就实现了“车子化”。全社每年可因此节省两万个以上的挑运劳动日。
    这个农业社在社长吴良义等带头制造六部木轮手车的鼓舞下，掀起了一个户户造车、人人修路的热潮。在七天中，就加宽和填平了十一条田间大路，利用旧木箱、木杠、旧门板、破床架和当地出产的荷木等，制造了一百六十二辆木轮手车，每部手车只花两角钱的铁钉费用。农业社原来计划用三万元建筑一座大桥，后来由社员们献计献力献木料改建浮桥，只花了三斤铁钉、十多个劳动日就修建了起来。
