    The Bold Words of 150,000 People in the Porcelain Capital
    Become Meritorious Workers in Building Socialism

    (Our dispatch) According to a report in the Jiangxi Daily: The 150,000 people of Jingdezhen City are carrying out a movement to render meritorious service for socialism, determined to muster revolutionary drive, go full speed ahead, and build a new socialist porcelain city.

    The movement to render meritorious service for socialism was initiated by the workers of the Jianguo Porcelain Factory. As early as late December last year, after rectification and socialist education, the workers of this factory greatly improved their ideological awareness, and a production upsurge began to appear. At this time, the factory convened a worker representative meeting to convey the spirit of the city's First People's Congress, Second Session. The worker representatives specifically discussed how to achieve a great leap forward in production, and used comparisons and stocktaking to calculate three accounts: construction and accumulation, production and welfare. The detailed calculations showed that each person in this factory accumulated less than 50 yuan for the country each year. However, in 1957, the factory's expenditure on labor insurance and welfare for workers averaged more than 60 yuan per person, greatly exceeding the profits turned over to the state.

    Through these three comparative accounts, the workers further clarified the position and responsibility of the working class in building socialism. Everyone felt ashamed of their small contributions. Some said painfully, "If this continues, we are not rushing towards socialism, but crawling towards it!" In particular, they felt even sadder because the low quality of their products caused losses to the country. They put forward the slogan "Rather not have wages than disgrace the factory." All the workers in the factory posted big-character posters, initiatives, and guarantees, determined to use practical actions to make up for the losses caused to the country, and determined to use greater achievements in production to render meritorious service for socialism.

    The slogan of rendering meritorious service for socialism was immediately enthusiastically responded to and supported by the people of the city, especially the porcelain production workers. Workers in the Sixth Porcelain Factory, in order to strive to render meritorious service for socialism, increased the number of advanced quota-breaking production teams from the original 25 to 45; the number of advanced workers has increased from 429 to 935. The number of advanced experiences learned and promoted has also increased from 12 to 32. In the movement to render meritorious service for socialism, the workers of many factories and cooperatives felt even more honored to work for socialism. There has also been a great change in the phenomena of disobedience to allocation, uneasiness in work, or picking and choosing jobs in the past. After the members of the Fifth Porcelain Cooperative put forward the initiative of "not distributing labor remuneration" (not distributing shares, continuing to expand reproduction), it was immediately supported by cooperative members throughout the city.

    Under the influence of the actions of porcelain production workers, farmers and residents in the suburbs also actively took action. Farmers in the suburbs proposed to strive for thousand-jin (500 kg/mu) cooperatives and thousand-jin townships; residents also proposed to be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, eliminate the four pests, and render meritorious service for socialism. Therefore, this movement swept the entire city in less than a month, forming a mass mobilization to accelerate socialist construction.

    瓷都十五万人民的豪语
    作建设社会主义的功臣
    本报讯　据江西日报报道：景德镇市十五万人民群众开展为社会主义立功运动，决心鼓起革命干劲，快马加鞭，建设社会主义新瓷城。
    为社会主义立功运动是由建国瓷厂职工们发起的。早在去年12月下旬，这个厂职工经过整风和社会主义教育运动，思想觉悟大大提高，生产高潮开始出现。就在这时，厂里召开职工代表大会，传达了市一届二次党代会精神，职工代表具体讨论了如何实现生产大跃进，并利用对比和铺开家底，算了建设与积累、生产与福利等三笔账。通过算细账表明，这个厂每人每年为国家积累还不到五十元。可是1957年这个厂用于职工劳保福利的开支平均每人是六十多元，已经大大超过上缴国家的利润。
    通过这三笔对比账，职工进一步明确了工人阶级在建设社会主义中的地位和责任。人人感到因自己的贡献少而惭愧。有的痛心地说，如果这样下去，我们不是奔向社会主义，而是爬向社会主义了。特别是由于自己生产的产品质量低，给国家造成损失，更感到难过。提出“宁可不要工资，也不给工厂丢脸”的口号。全厂职工纷纷贴出大字报、倡议书、保证书，决心用实际行动，弥补给国家造成的损失，立志用生产中更大的成绩，为社会主义立功。
    为社会主义立功的口号立即受到全市人民，首先是瓷业生产工人热烈响应和支持。第六瓷厂工人，为了争取为社会主义立功，先进突破定额生产小组由原来二十五个增加到四十五个；先进工人已由四百二十九人增加到九百三十五人。学习与推广先进经验也由十二种增加到三十二种。在为社会主义立功运动中，使许多厂、社职工们更加感到为社会主义而劳动的光荣。过去不服从调配，不安心工作或挑肥拣瘦的现象也有了很大转变。第五瓷社社员提出“不分劳动返还金”（不分掉股金，继续扩大再生产）的倡议后，立即得到全市社员拥护。
    在瓷业生产工人行动的影响下，郊区农民、居民，也积极行动起来。郊区农民提出要争取千斤社、千斤乡；居民群众也提出勤俭持家，消灭四害，为社会主义立功。所以这一运动，还不到一个月的时间，就席卷全市，形成了群众性的加速社会主义建设的总动员。
