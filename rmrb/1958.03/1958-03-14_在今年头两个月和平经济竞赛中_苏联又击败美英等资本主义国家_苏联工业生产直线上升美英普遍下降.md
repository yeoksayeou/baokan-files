Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th: In the first two months of this year, Soviet industrial production continued to rise sharply. Judging from the production situation and development speed, the Soviet Union once again defeated its main opponents, the United States and other capitalist countries, in the peaceful economic competition.

According to a communique issued today by the Central Statistical Bureau of the Soviet Council of Ministers, the Soviet Union completed 103.5% of its industrial production plan for the first two months of this year, and the total industrial output increased by 11% compared with the same period last year. During these two months, the plan to improve industrial labor productivity was completed by 101%, and labor productivity increased by 7.5% compared with the same period last year.

The communique pointed out that the most important industrial products of the Soviet Union have further increased production in the first two months of this year. During this period, the Soviet Union produced 6.2 million tons of pig iron, 8.7 million tons of steel, 79.2 million tons of coal, 17.2 million tons of oil, and 33 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.

During this period, Soviet industry produced more consumer goods for the people. Among them, cotton fabrics reached 935 million meters, woolen fabrics reached 48.7 million meters, silk fabrics reached 139 million meters, sugar reached 1.1 million tons, and meat and oils reached 1.81 million tons.

However, materials from the United States show that in January of this year, US industrial production fell to its lowest level in three years since February 1955. According to weekly statistics from many industrial sectors, compared with January of this year, American steel production decreased by nearly 4% in February, bituminous coal mining decreased by 8%, and automobile production decreased by 17%. If we compare February of this year with the same period last year, the above three products decreased by nearly 43%, 20%, and 31% respectively.

In the United Kingdom, coal mining in January of this year decreased by 5% compared with the previous year, and steel production in February decreased by 2% compared with January of last year. The production level of many other industrial sectors was also lower or stagnant than a year ago.

The industrial production situation in West Germany is also not good. In the first two months of this year, many of its industrial sectors continued to be in a state of stagnation, and some sectors have shown signs of recession.

    在今年头两个月和平经济竞赛中
    苏联又击败美英等资本主义国家
    苏联工业生产直线上升美英普遍下降
    新华社莫斯科13日电  苏联今年头两个月的工业生产进一步直线上升，就生产情况和发展速度来看，今年头两月苏联在和平经济竞赛中再一次击败了它的主要对手美国和其他资本主义国家。
    据苏联部长会议中央统计局今天发表的公报宣布，苏联今年头两个月的工业生产计划完成了103.5％，工业总产量比去年同期增加了11％。在这两个月内，提高工业劳动生产率的计划完成了101％，劳动生产率比去年同期提高了7.5％。
    公报指出，苏联最重要的工业品在今年头两个月都进一步增产了。在这期间，苏联生产了六百二十万吨生铁，八百七十万吨钢，七千九百二十万吨煤，一千七百二十万吨石油，三百三十亿度电力。
    在这期间，苏联工业为人民生产了更多的消费品。其中，棉织品达九亿三千五百万公尺，毛织品达四千八百七十万公尺，丝织品达一亿三千九百万公尺，砂糖达一百一十万吨，肉类和油脂达一百八十一万吨。
    然而，来自美国的材料表明，今年1月份，美国的工业生产下降到从1955年2月起三年来的最低水平。根据许多工业部门的每周统计数字，今年2月份和1月份比较，美国钢铁减产了将近4％，烟煤开采量减少了8％，汽车生产量减少了17％。如果把今年2月同去年同期比较，上 述三种产品则分别减少了将近43％、20％和31％。
    在英国，同前一年相比，今年1月份的采煤量下降了5％，今年2月份的钢产量比去年1月份下降了2％，其他许多工业部门的生产水平也都比一年前低或者停滞不前。
    西德的工业生产情况也不妙。今年头两个月，它的许多工业部门继续处于停滞状态，有些部门已出现衰退征象。
