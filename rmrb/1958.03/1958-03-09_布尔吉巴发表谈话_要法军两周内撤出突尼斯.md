Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, March 8th: Tunisian President Bourguiba demanded on March 7th that French troops withdraw from Tunisia before March 20th. He said that otherwise "many things could happen."

Speaking to a CBS reporter, Bourguiba said that Tunisia will celebrate the second anniversary of its independence on March 20th, and it is "hard to believe" that his country is still occupied by foreign troops two years after independence.

Bourguiba pointed out that he "no longer has any confidence" in direct negotiations with France. He said that French troops must withdraw from bases, including Bizerte, and grant Algeria full independence, and then North Africa will hold direct negotiations with France again.

Regarding American "mediation," Bourguiba said that "there is not much time left" to seek reconciliation between France and Tunisia. He also emphasized that if the Americans want to intervene and try to end the Algerian War, and "make the people of North Africa feel that they are friends of the West," this is "achievable."

Speaking of relations with Egypt, Bourguiba again attacked Egypt in his speech for being involved in the so-called "conspiracy" to assassinate him. He threatened that Tunisia would sever diplomatic relations with Egypt unless Egypt made a "full explanation."

    布尔吉巴发表谈话
    要法军两周内撤出突尼斯
    新华社8日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯总统布尔吉巴7日要求法国军队在3月20日前撤出突尼斯。他说，否则“许多事情都可能发生”。
    布尔吉巴在对美国哥伦比亚广播公司记者发表谈话时说，突尼斯将在3月20日庆祝独立两周年，他的国家在独立了两年后仍然被外国军队占领着，这是“很难令人相信”的。
    布尔吉巴指出，他对于同法国直接谈判“已不再有任何信心”。他说，法国军队必须从包括比塞大在内的基地撤出，并且给予阿尔及利亚完全的独立，然后北非才会再次和法国举行直接谈判。
    在谈到美国的“斡旋”时，布尔吉巴说，在法国和突尼斯之间谋求和解的“时间已经不多了”。他同时强调，如果美国人希望干预和设法结束阿尔及利亚战争，并且“使北非人民感到他们是西方的朋友”，这是“能够做到”的。
    谈到对埃及的关系，布尔吉巴在谈话中再次攻击埃及同所谓要谋杀他的“阴谋”有关。他威胁说，除非埃及进行“充分的解释”，突尼斯将要断绝同埃及的外交关系。
