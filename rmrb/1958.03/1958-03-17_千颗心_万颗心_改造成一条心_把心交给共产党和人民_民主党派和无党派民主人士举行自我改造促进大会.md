The main platform of the conference was set up at the southern end of Tiananmen Square, facing the majestic Tiananmen. On both sides of the platform, huge red banners with golden characters were hung: Accept the Leadership of the Communist Party, Follow the Socialist Road.

At 2:00 PM, contingents from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, non-party democratic figures, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League began to converge on Tiananmen Square. Tiananmen Square was a scene of jubilation, filled with colorful flags and red banners of determination, and the sound of gongs and drums everywhere. The venue was surrounded by countless citizens forming layers of human walls.

At 3:00 PM, the conference began. Shen Junru delivered the opening speech, and Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, and Huang Yanpei spoke successively. They represented members of various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in expressing their determination to unite thousands of hearts and tens of thousands of hearts into one heart, to contribute their knowledge, exert their strength, and dedicate everything to the beloved motherland, to the people, and to the Communist Party.

The conference finally adopted the Socialist Self-Remolding Covenant of Democratic Parties and Non-Party Democratic Figures and a letter to Chairman Mao.

"Give our hearts to the Party, resolutely be leftists," "Be loyal to socialism, strive to be both red and expert," people shouted such slogans everywhere in the endless parade. In the eastern parade led by Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Chen Qiyou, and Li Chunqing, members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang carried a huge heart made of red cloth, with the words "Give our hearts to the Party" written horizontally on it. In the parade of the China National Democratic Construction Association, industrialists and businessmen carried ten large red "囍" (double happiness) character plaques. This indicated that this was another "giving our hearts" movement after they handed over the means of production in 1956, a great joyous event.

Shen Junru, who was over eighty years old, and Guo Moruo, who was nearly seventy, walked at the forefront of the western parade. Non-party democratic figures Li Dequan and Zhang Xiruo, members of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League Deng Chumin and Hu Yuzhi, carried a tall wooden frame with the covenant of various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures inlaid on it. When the parade passed the Xinhua Gate, the location of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, Shen Junru took the lead in shouting "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the China Association for Promoting Democracy strive to ensure that leftists and middle-leftists account for 80% of their members within three years. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and the China Zhi Gong Party want to transform into socialist political parties within two years. In the parade, people carried huge red signs with the words "Compare Rectification, Compare Remolding, Compare Leap Forward" forward. Members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party expressed on a large banner that they were determined to completely give their hearts in five aspects in this rectification movement to accelerate remolding. The "five givings" they proposed are: give their understanding of the Communist Party; give their understanding of socialism; give their words and deeds and ideological activities during the great blooming and contending last year; give the influence of the words and deeds of right-wing elements on individuals; give their ideological understanding after the anti-rightist struggle.

The parade of the Jiusan Society carried a socialist competition determination letter. Their competition conditions proposed to ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by the national scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and to actively promote technological innovation; to integrate with workers and peasants, and to be determined to be both red and expert, even redder and more expert intellectuals of the working class.

Many old people with silver hair and white beards participated in today's parade. They were vigorous in their old age and determined to be red old men. In the ranks of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the "Ten Elders' Determination Letter" of Zhu Yunshan and other ten old people over seventy years old attracted the attention of many people. They stated in the letter of determination that they would live and learn and work until old age, and dedicate their later years to the Communist Party and socialism.
