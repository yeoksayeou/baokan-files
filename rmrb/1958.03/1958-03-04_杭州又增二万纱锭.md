Hangzhou Adds Another 20,000 Spindles

    A new workshop of the Hangzhou Joint State-Private Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory in Zhejiang Province – with 20,000 yarn spindles and 10,000 thread spindles – was officially put into production on February 28, two months ahead of schedule.
    The new workshop can produce 8,700 pieces of 32-count and 42-count yarn annually. The machines in each process of the workshop are all made in China in the last two years and are much better than the original equipment of the factory. The newly built 20,000 spindles only require more than 460 workers per day on three shifts, which is about half the number of workers required for the original 30,000 spindles.

    杭州又增二万纱锭
    浙江省杭州市公私合营杭州棉纺织厂新建的一个车间——二万纱锭和一万线锭，已提前二个月于2月28日正式投入生产。
    新建车间每年能生产三十二和四十二支纱八千七百件。车间内各工序的机器都是最近二年内我国自己制造的，比该厂原有设备要优良得多。新建的二万纱锭每天开三班只需四百六十多个工人，比原有三万纱锭所需的工人少一半左右。
