Jiangsu, Beijing, and 15 Other Provinces and Cities
Fully Collaborate to Reform Technology

    This newspaper reports that seventeen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Anhui, and Gansu, are mutually supporting each other in agricultural and forestry production technology and materials. Three hundred rice cultivation experts have already departed for Shandong Province to assist in the "dry land to paddy field conversion" work. Among them are Huang Pu, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, technician Shen Qingxing, and ten technical cadres specializing in crop cultivation and plant protection. Also present is Tang Yugeng, associate researcher at the East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, as well as administrative leaders from Jiangsu's dry-land to paddy field conversion areas from the previous two years, and rice production experts from agricultural cooperatives in Suzhou, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang prefectures.
    This year, Jiangsu's support to other provinces in seeds has greatly increased compared to previous years. The transfer of 40 million jin of high-quality rice seeds, such as "Lao Lai Qing," to Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, and five other provinces has already commenced successively. Jiangsu Province's support of more than 30 million jin of Daizi cotton seeds to Shandong and Hebei provinces has been shipped; in addition, 8,000 jin of Yanghuai tree seeds and more than 40,000 jin of French parasol tree seeds were supplied to Qinghai, Gansu, Anhui and other provinces and regions. Some peach seedlings and mulberry seeds were also supplied to Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Hunan, Fujian, and other places.
    In terms of developing mulberry gardens, tea gardens, and orchards, many provinces and regions have provided strong support to Jiangsu. Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces provided 2,800 dan of tea seeds, and 20,000 mu of tea gardens have now been planted. Beijing and Shandong and Zhejiang provinces supplied Jiangsu Province with many crabapple seeds and seedlings of apples and oranges.
