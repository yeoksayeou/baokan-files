American Dark Side

    Life Insurance Business Thriving
    Prosperity Amidst Recession
    In the generally declining economy of the United States, one industry has experienced unprecedented prosperity. Oddly enough, this industry doesn't produce anything; according to the American "Newsweek," its product is merely "a piece of paper and a guarantee." This industry is the life insurance industry.
    Browne, deputy editor of "Newsweek," recently conducted an investigation into this industry. In his investigative report in the March 10th issue of "Newsweek," Browne pointed out that in just seven short years, the total amount of life insurance in force in the United States has doubled. The two largest life insurance companies are doing particularly well: in 1957, the sales of Prudential Life Insurance reached $11.2 billion, an increase of 36% over 1956.

    Uninsured and Insured
    Why can the sales of life insurance companies increase so rapidly when most economic sectors in the United States are declining?
    John Hancock, vice president of Mutual Life Insurance, answered this question, saying that this is primarily because "more and more people are beginning to realize they need insurance," and secondly, "people cannot accumulate money under our country's high tax structure." From the words of this vice president, it can be seen that in the United States under war hysteria and heavy taxes, everyone feels insecure about their life and property, which is the real reason for the abnormal prosperity of the insurance industry.

    The Secret to Getting Rich
    American life insurance companies have mastered a set of skillful business practices in market competition, which is another important reason for the industry's wealth. According to "Newsweek," life insurance companies spend millions of dollars each year recruiting new brokers. Those who are recruited undergo strict selection, and the companies spare no expense in opening training courses to impart various professional skills, including even telephone techniques.
    Due to strict selection and training, life insurance companies have a large number of sharp-eyed, quick-handed, and adept brokers and employees. Some brokers, relying on their silver tongues, can make even someone who is unwilling to take out life insurance reluctantly purchase their insurance policy. Harold Dillan, director of the National Life Insurance office, openly declared that a good broker "must have the ability to force people to act."
    Life insurance companies also rely on their strong capital to engage in speculation and profiteering activities that harm others and benefit themselves, thereby reaping huge profits. For example, when oil prices fell and many oil merchants were under pressure from banks, Prudential Insurance raised mortgage interest rates and lent capital to refineries. (Attached image)

### 人寿保险生意兴隆

    人寿保险生意兴隆
    萧条中的繁荣
    在经济普遍衰退的美国，有一个行业却出现了空前的繁荣景象。奇怪的是，这个行业并不生产什么，按美国“新闻周刊”的说法，它的产品只是“一张纸和一个保证”。这个行业就是人寿保险业。
    “新闻周刊”的副主编布朗最近对这个行业进行了一次调查。布朗在3月10日“新闻周刊”上的调查报告中指出，在短短的七年内，美国有效的人寿保险总额增加了一倍。两家最大的人寿保险公司生意特别兴隆：1957年万全人寿保险公司的营业额达一百一十二亿美元，比1956年增加36％。
    不保险和保险
    为什么在美国大部分经济部门衰退的时候，人寿保险公司的营业额还能增加得这样快？
    相互人寿保险公司的副总经理约翰·汉考克回答了这个问题，他说，这首先是因为“越来越多的人开始认识到他们需要保险”，其次，“人们在我国高税率的结构下不可能积聚金钱。”从这位副总经理的话中可以看出，在战争歇斯底里和苛捐杂税下的美国，每一个人都感到生命财产不保险，这就是保险业畸形繁荣的真正原因。
    发财的秘诀
    美国人寿保险公司掌握了一套市场角逐中的熟练的生意经，这是这个行业发财致富的另一重要原因。据“新闻周刊”报道，人寿保险公司每年都花费数以百万计的美元招募新的掮客，录取的人都经过严格的挑选，公司还不惜本钱，开设了训练班，传授各项专业技术，甚至包括打电话的技巧在内。
    由于经过严格的挑选和训练，人寿保险公司拥有大批眼明手快、巧于钻营的掮客和雇员。有的掮客凭着三寸不烂之舌，便能使一个不愿作人寿保险的人也只得半推半就地购买他的保险券。国民人寿保险公司的办事处主任哈罗德·戴朗公开宣称：一个好的掮客“必须具有强迫人们行动的能力”。
    人寿保险公司还依靠它的雄厚资本进行投机倒把、损人利己的活动，从而获取暴利。例如，当油价下降、许多油商受到银行压力时，万全保险公司便提高抵押贷款利率，把资本贷与炼油厂。（附图片）
