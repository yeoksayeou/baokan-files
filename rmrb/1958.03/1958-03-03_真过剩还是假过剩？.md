From the Editor's Desk:

    Some commercial departments are ordering less goods or even returning goods during peak seasons. According to analysis, there are two reasons for this: First, they only see the current substantial increase in market demand for means of production and fail to see the upcoming season of brisk sales for consumer goods; second, the mentality of "rather have stockpiles than run out of stock" is at play.

    These two reasons can be summarized as one: a one-sided view of the problem. The current increase in market demand for means of production necessitates strengthening business in this area, which is both appropriate and necessary. However, if the normal needs of the broad masses for consumer goods are ignored, and preparations for supply are not made early, then when the peak season arrives, there will be chaos, with shortages here and shortages there. Stockpiling goods is certainly undesirable, and commercial workers should find ways to reduce stockpiles and accelerate capital turnover. However, if, to reduce stockpiles, goods that should be stocked are not, or fewer goods are stocked than should be, causing consumers to be unable to buy what they need, then an even greater mistake will be made.

    The study and analysis of problems must be comprehensive, not just looking at the left and not the right, only seeing the present and not the future. Therefore, it is hoped that those commercial organizations requesting returns of goods will re-examine whether the surplus of goods is real or false.

### 真过剩还是假过剩？

    真过剩还是假过剩？
    某些商业部门旺季少要货、甚至退货，据分析有两个原因：一是只看见目前市场对生产资料的需求大大增加，而看不见消费品畅销的季节即将到来；二是“怕积压不怕脱销”的思想在作怪。
    这两个原因可以归纳成一个，就是看问题的片面性。目前市场对生产资料的需求增加，加强这方面的业务，是应该的，也是必要的。但是，如果忽视了广大人民对消费品的正常需要，不早点准备货源，那末，等到市场旺季来临，就会手忙脚乱，这也脱销那也脱销。商品积压当然不好，商业工作者应该想办法减少积压，加速资金周转。但是，如果为了减少积压，该进货的不进，或者该多进的少进，使消费者买不到需要的东西，那就会犯更大的错误。
    研究和分析问题必须全面，不能只看左不看右，只看眼前不看将来。因此，希望那些要求退货的商业机关重新研究一下，看看商品是真过剩还是假过剩？
