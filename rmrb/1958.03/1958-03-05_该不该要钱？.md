	Should Money Be Charged?

	Some cities provide manure to suburban agricultural cooperatives free of charge for use as fertilizer; however, some cities still operate according to the old rules, requiring agricultural cooperatives to pay for the manure they collect, and individual units even haggle over the price of manure. Should cities charge for manure? This is a question worth studying.

	In socialist society, the relationship between cities and villages has transformed from one of opposition and exploitation to one of mutual assistance and cooperation. Under this new circumstance, many urban residents voluntarily go to the countryside to help farmers with voluntary labor during the busy farming season, and consciously collect garbage and other fertilizers for farmers on a regular basis. This fully demonstrates the new socialist relationship between urban residents and farmers. Given this, why can't the practice of selling manure for a price be changed?

    该不该要钱？
    有些城市把粪便无代价地供给郊区农业社作肥料；也有些城市至今还是按老规矩办事，农业社必须给钱才能挑粪，个别单位甚至还要争粪价。城市里的粪，究竟该不该要钱？这是一个值得研究的问题。
    在社会主义社会里，城市和乡村已经由过去的对立和剥削的关系转为互助和协作的关系了。在这个新情况下，许多城市人民在农忙季节自愿地下乡帮助农民义务劳动，自觉地经常为农民收集垃圾等肥料，这充分表现了城市人民与农民之间的社会主义的新关系。既然如此，那么粪便作价出卖的做法为什么不能改变呢？
