    In what year was the "March 8th" International Women's Day established?
      "March 8th" International Women's Day is a festival for women all over the world to unite and strive for liberation. As early as 1907, the Socialist Women's Congress was held in Germany. Clara Zetkin presided over the meeting, and a secretariat was established after the meeting. The international socialist women's movement began to have a leading body. On March 8, 1909, female workers in Chicago, USA, held strikes and demonstrations to fight for gender equality. Their actions were supported by American women and women all over the world. In 1910, the Second International Socialist Women's Congress was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. Clara Zetkin proposed that March 8 be designated as International Working Women's Day. The conference adopted this proposal. Since then, "March 8th" has become a festival for women all over the world.

    “三八”国际妇女节是哪一年确定的？
      “三八”国际妇女节是全世界妇女团结争取解放的节日。远在1907年，社会主义妇女代表大会在德国举行，蔡特金主持了这次会议，会后并设立了秘书处，国际社会主义妇女运动开始有了领导机关。1909年3月8日，美国芝加哥的女工为了争取男女平等，举行了罢工和示威游行。她们的行动受到了美国妇女和全世界妇女的支持。1910年，第二次国际社会主义妇女代表大会在丹麦首都哥本哈根举行，蔡特金提议，把3月8日定为国际劳动妇女节。大会通过了这个提案。以后，“三八”便成了全世界妇女的节日。
