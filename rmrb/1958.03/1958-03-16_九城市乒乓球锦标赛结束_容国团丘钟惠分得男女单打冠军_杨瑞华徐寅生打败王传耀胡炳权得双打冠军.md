Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 15th - The 1958 Nine-City Table Tennis Championships concluded completely tonight.

	Shanghai's Men's Red Team, Yang Ruihua and Xu Yinsheng, defeated their final opponents, Wang Chuanyao and Hu Bingquan of Beijing First Team, in the men's doubles competition today, securing the championship. The four athletes participating in this match engaged in long rallies and short attacks, making for a very exciting game. In the final stage of the third game, the score was tied at 20-20, but Wang Chuanyao made two consecutive errors, making the score 20-22. The scores for the other four games were 21-19, 17-21, 21-16, and 16-21.

	The women's doubles championship was won by Ye Peiqiong and Qiu Zhonghui of the Beijing First Team, who competed against Zhu Peimin and Chi Huifang of the Shanghai Red Team for the title. The mixed doubles championship went to Wang Chuanyao and Qiu Zhonghui, who defeated Xu Yinsheng and Zhang Xiuying of the Shanghai Red Team.

	Tonight, three young athletes participating in the championships, Guo Zhonggong, Wu Hong (Tianjin Team), and Zhuang Zedong (Beijing Second Team), held three exhibition matches with Shanghai's young athletes Wang Rongji, Tu Hangang, and Li Furong.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 15th - Twenty-one-year-old young table tennis player Rong Guotuan defeated Wang Chuanyao with an absolute advantage of three to zero on the 14th, winning the men's singles title of the 1958 Nine-City Table Tennis Championships. The women's singles title was won by Qiu Zhonghui, who defeated last year's champion Ye Peiqiong three to one in the championship and runner-up final.

	The reason for Wang Chuanyao's defeat was mainly due to excessive tension on the spot, with more unforced errors in his serves, and he was unable to cope with Rong Guotuan's flexible serves and varied spins, with multiple smashes going out of bounds. Rong Guotuan maintained an undefeated record throughout this championship.

    九城市乒乓球锦标赛结束
    容国团丘钟惠分得男女单打冠军
    杨瑞华徐寅生打败王传耀胡炳权得双打冠军
    据新华社上海15日电　1958年九城市乒乓球锦标赛今晚全部结束。
    上海男子红队杨瑞华、徐寅生，今天在男子双打比赛中，战胜了他们最后一对对手北京一队的王传耀、胡炳权，获得冠军。参加这场比赛的四个运动员，相互长抽短杀，打得十分精彩。其中第三局最后，双方已经拉到二十平，最后却为王传耀连续失误两球而成二十比二十二。其他四局的比数是二十一比十九、十七比二十一、二十一比十六、十六比二十一。
    女子双打冠军被北京一队的叶佩琼、丘钟惠获得，同她们争夺冠军的是上海红队朱培民、池惠芳。男女混合双打的冠军是王传耀和丘钟惠，他们战胜了上海红队的徐寅生和张秀英。
    今晚三个参加锦标赛的青少年运动员郭仲恭、吴宏（天津队）和庄则栋（北京二队），在会上同上海市的少年运动员王荣基、屠汉刚、李富荣分别作了三场表演赛。
    据新华社上海15日电　二十一岁的青年乒乓球运动员容国团，14日以三比零绝对优势打败王传耀，取得了1958年九城市乒乓球锦标赛男子单打冠军。女子单打冠军由丘钟惠夺得，她在冠军、亚军决赛中，以三比一战胜了去年的冠军叶佩琼。
    王传耀失败的原因，主要是临场过分紧张，自己发球失误较多，又接应不住容国团灵活的发球和变化多端的旋球，多次扣球出界。容国团在这次锦标赛中，一直保持不败的纪录。
