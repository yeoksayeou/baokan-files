Gansu Province's Great Development of Local Small-Scale Factories and Mines
	Party Secretary Takes the Lead; Masses Invest
	Guangdong Raises Funds to Build More Than 400 Small and Medium-Sized Factories and Mines

(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 27th dispatch) Reporter Guo Fenxiang reports: Gansu Province, which has a very weak local industrial base, has built hundreds of small factories and mines in the past fifty days, with new factories being born and put into production every day, because Party Secretaries at all levels personally took the lead and resolutely followed the mass line. Factories have not only entered the countryside but have also gone up the mountains. Currently, more factories and mines are under intensive construction.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Party committees at all levels throughout the province have, on the one hand, fiercely dug out the roots of right-leaning conservatism, and on the other hand, criticized the pessimistic argument of "Gansu's backwardness" and established the correct idea of the entire people running industry. People's minds have been liberated, and local initiative and small-scale industry have also been rapidly liberated. County and district-level Party secretaries personally took the lead, grasping agriculture with one hand and industry with the other, adopting the method of planning, building, and producing simultaneously, and immediately starting to work when they spoke of it.

In just a few dozen days, thanks to mainly relying on mass fundraising to solve the problem of funds, the funds raised have been more than the state's investment in local industry in the past three years. The masses have also taken out timber, bamboo, waste copper, and old ironware to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. Due to the organization of the masses to actively report mines, thousands of resources have been discovered, and many useful industrial raw materials have been found in the deep mountains and remote areas. What was originally considered a "poor place" has now been confirmed as a treasure trove. The technical problems that had always been a headache have been solved by looking downwards and finding a group of skilled workers from handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. Guangwei County alone found more than 540 people with skills in machinery, electrical engineering, and other technologies. In some places, factory and mine workers are also training new workers by taking on apprentices. The Wuwei Local Sugar Factory can produce both brown sugar and white sugar, with high quality and low cost. However, no one had ever promoted these experiences in the past. Now, this place has become a "technical school," with a continuous stream of people from all over the country coming to learn the experience of local sugar production. Old factories have also adopted the method of "hens laying eggs," using their own accumulated funds and technical forces to develop new factories.

(Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 27th dispatch) Reporter Zhao Ying reports: The entire Party and the entire people of Guangdong Province are enthusiastically running industry, and self-raised funds have reached 100 million yuan. It has been decided to use this fund to build more than 400 small and medium-sized factories and mines, salt fields, and power stations. Some fertilizer factories and farm tool factories have already started construction, and the others are about to start construction as well.

A prominent advantage of Guangdong Province's use of self-raised funds to run industry is that it can build small and medium-sized factories and mines that are quick to take effect and have a large effect based on local characteristics and using local materials. The Zhanjiang Special District decided to start with small-scale industry. This year, the number of joint processing plants built with self-raised funds alone is 40, and there are 151 small hydropower stations with power generation ranging from tens of kilowatts to hundreds of kilowatts, almost achieving a hydropower station in every township. Dozens of fertilizer factories and farm tool factories are also being invested in and built. Shaoguan area, a mountainous area with relatively rich mineral resources, will vigorously develop small-scale mining production. Within this year, it will build lead-zinc mines with an annual output of 250,000 tons, pyrite mines with an annual output of 80,000 tons, cobalt mines with an annual output of 1,000 tons, as well as manganese mines and cobalt oxide mines.

In agricultural areas, the industries invested in with self-raised funds are all oriented towards the countryside, supporting the great development of agriculture. Huiyang Special District, which has always been known for its barren land, will use most of its nearly 5 million yuan in self-raised industrial funds this year to build a total of 16 new factories, including seaweed fertilizer factories, locally produced ammonium sulfate factories, and bittern fertilizer factories, which can produce tens of thousands of tons of various fertilizers every year. This will be of great benefit to changing the soil quality and increasing crop yields in this area.

The sources of self-raised funds in various places come from four aspects: agricultural cooperative investment; cadre donations; local fiscal revenue; and attracting investment from local overseas Chinese.

In order to further encourage the enthusiasm of various places in developing local industry, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently decided to decentralize 54 factories that were originally under the provincial level to county and city level factories. It has also been decided that all ten newly built sugar factories will be decentralized. (Attached pictures)

    甘肃省地方小型厂矿大发展
    书记挂帅　群众投资
    广东筹足兴建四百多个中小型厂矿的资金
    本报兰州27日电　记者郭汾祥报道：地方工业基础非常薄弱的甘肃省，由于各级党委书记亲自挂帅，并坚决地走了群众路线，近五十天来已经建成成百的小型厂矿，每天都有新工厂诞生，投入生产。工厂不仅进了乡，同时还上了山。目前，还有更多的厂矿在加紧建设。
    自从八届三中全会以来，全省各级党委一方面狠狠挖掉了右倾保守的根子，另一方面也批判了“甘肃落后论”的消极论调，树立了全民办工业的正确思想。人们的思想解放了，地方积极性和小型工业也迅速得到了解放。县和专区级党委书记们亲自挂帅，一手抓农业，一手抓工业，采取边计划边建设边生产的方法，说干就立即干起来。
    短短数十天中，由于主要依靠了群众集资来解决资金问题，已经集合的资金比三年来国家对地方工业的投资还要多，群众还拿出木材、竹子、废铜和旧铁器，来解决原材料不足的困难。由于组织群众积极报矿，发现的资源以千计，深山野岭中也找到了许多有用的工业原料，原来认为是“穷地方”，现在证实是聚宝盆。一向感到头痛的技术问题，由于眼睛向下看，从手工业社、农业社中找到了一批有手艺的工人。光渭源一个县就找到了有机械、电机等技术的人员五百四十多人。有的地方厂矿的工人，也是采取带徒弟的办法培养新工人。武威土糖厂能制红糖，也能制白糖，质量高，成本低。但是过去从来无人推广这些经验，现在这里已变成“技术学校”，各地前来学习土法制糖经验的人员，络绎不绝。老厂子还采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，利用本身积累资金和技术力量，发展新工厂。
    本报广州27日电　记者赵颖报道：广东省全党全民热情办工业，自筹资金已达一亿元。这笔资金，已决定用来兴建四百多个中小型的厂矿、盐场和发电站。其中一些肥料厂和农具厂已经动工，其它的也就要动工。
    广东省利用自筹资金办工业的一个突出优点是能够根据地方特点，就地取材，兴建收效快、收效大的中小型厂矿。湛江专区决定由小型工业起家，今年光用自筹资金兴建的联合加工厂就有四十家，发电量在几十瓩到几百瓩的小型水力发电站有一百五十一个，几乎做到乡乡有水电站。投资兴建的还有几十家肥料厂和农具厂。矿产比较丰富的山区——韶关地区，将大力发展小矿生产，今年内要建成年产二十五万吨的铅锌矿、八万吨的硫铁矿、一千吨的钴矿以及锰矿和氧化钴矿等。
    在农业地区由自筹资金投资的工业都做到面向农村，支援农业大发展。一向以土地贫瘠出名的惠阳专区，今年自筹工业资金近五百万元中，大部分用来新建海肥厂、土制硫酸铵厂、苦鹵肥厂等一共十六个厂，每年可生产各种肥料好几万吨。这对改变这个地区的土质，提高农作物产量将会有很大好处。
    各地自筹资金的来源都是来自四方面：农业社投资；干部捐款；地方财政收入；吸收当地华侨投资。
    为了进一步鼓励各地发展地方工业的积极性，广东省人民委员会最近又决定，把五十四家原属省级厂下放为县、市级厂。还有新建的十家糖厂也决定全部下放。（附图片）
