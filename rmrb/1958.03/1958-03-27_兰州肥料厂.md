    Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant

    The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, currently under construction, is expected to go into production in the fourth quarter of this year. At present, the plant is training its technical workers. The first group of over 300 people, mostly transferred from brother factories and the plant itself, have a junior high school education or above and a certain level of work ability. After three months of study, they will be able to independently operate in their chosen specializations. (Attached picture)
