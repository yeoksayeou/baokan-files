　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd - The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on the 21st that the United States' cost of living index rose to a new high in February. The index for this month was 122.5 (with the 1947-49 average as 100), an increase of 3.2% compared to a year ago. Due to rising prices, workers' real wages fell by about 5% compared to a year ago.

　　The increase in the cost of living index in February was due to general increases in food, medical expenses, rent, and transportation costs. According to Ewan Clague, Commissioner of Labor Statistics, there are no signs of a decline in the cost of living index in the coming months.

　　The United States is currently experiencing an economic recession, with industrial production declining month by month, and a large increase in the number of unemployed. However, the cost of living is constantly rising, which shows that American monopoly capital is making every effort to raise prices in order to shift the burden of the recession onto the American working people.

    垄断资本转嫁经济衰退重担
    美国物价攀上新的高峰
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：美国劳工统计局21日宣布，美国生活费用指数在2月份又升到新的高峰。这一个月的指数是一百二十二点五（1947—49年的平均数为一百），比一年前上涨了3.2％。由于物价上涨，工人的实际工资比一年前下降了约5％。
    2月份生活费用指数的上涨是由于食品、医药费用、房租和交通费用普遍上升。据劳工统计局局长克拉格说，在今后几个月内，生活费用指数还看不到有下降的迹象。
    美国目前正在经历着一次经济衰退、工业生产逐月下降、失业人数大量增加、然而生活费用却不断上升，这说明美国垄断资本正在竭力抬高物价，以便把衰退的重担转嫁到美国劳动人民身上。
