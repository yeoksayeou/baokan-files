    Veteran Cadre Special Classes in Higher Education Set an Example with Excellent Results; It is Both Necessary and Possible for Veteran Cadres to Learn Science and Technology
    (Our report) Can veteran cadres with revolutionary experience but low educational levels conquer the fortress of science and technology and become socialist university students? The excellent academic performance of students in the veteran cadre special classes in some national institutions of higher education provides an affirmative answer to this question. More than 300 veteran cadres at the level of section chief and above studying at nine higher technical schools, including the Beijing Mining Institute and the Aviation Institute, have generally performed very well, and not a single one has dropped out due to poor grades.
    Most of the students studying in these veteran cadre special classes have only a junior high school education, and some have not even completed elementary school. However, they study diligently and assiduously, and their academic performance has steadily improved. At the Veteran Cadre Special Class of Tsinghua University in Beijing, the number of students who obtained a grade of four or five accounts for 82% of all students in the class. At the Beijing Aviation Institute and the Beijing Institute of Technology, about a quarter of the eighty students in the veteran cadre special classes were not familiar with fraction calculations in elementary school before entering the school. Within more than two years, they have basically completed the higher mathematics necessary for their majors; they have completed more than half of the university physics, and some have not only completed the high school part of chemistry but have also basically completed university general chemistry. After more than two years of study, they have reached the general level of undergraduates in the above courses. That is to say, they can complete the courses that young students complete in five or six years in about two and a half or one and a half years. Chen Zixin, the director of the Rubber Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, who originally only had a junior high school education, received a grade of five in most of his courses. The veteran cadre classes at the Beijing Mining Institute and the Railway Institute were established earlier, and the first group of students are now doing their graduation designs and will go to the production front in early summer this year.
    In order to train more veteran cadres who are both red and expert, master science and technology, and play a backbone role on the production front, some national higher engineering colleges are now actively preparing to continue to expand the enrollment of veteran cadres. It is expected that more veteran cadres will go to institutions of higher education for further study this summer.

    高等学校老干部特别班用优良的成绩作出了榜样
    老干部学会科学技术既必要又可能
    本报讯　有革命斗争经验但文化水平较低的老干部，能否攻破科学技术堡垒，成为社会主义的大学生？全国部分高等学校设有老干部特别班的学生学习成绩优良的事实，肯定回答了这个问题。在北京矿业学院、航空学院等九所高等工业学校学习的三百多名处长以上的老干部，学习成绩普遍很好，没有一个因成绩不好而中途辍学的。
    在这些老干部特别班学习的学员，多数只具有初中的文化水平，有的连小学课程也没有念完。但是，他们勤学苦钻，学习成绩稳步地上升。在北京清华大学老干部特别班学习的学员获得四分或五分的人数已占全班学员的82％。北京航空学院和北京工业学院，老干部特别班中的八十个学员，入校前小学算术通分都不熟悉的约占四分之一。在两年多的时间内，为专业所必要的高等数学，有的已基本上学完；大学物理已学完了一半多，化学有的不仅学完高中部分，还基本上学完了大学普通化学。经过两年多的学习，对上述课程已达到本科一般水平，其中五人已转入本科学习。这就是说，他们以二年半或一年半的时间，大体上就能完成青年学生用五、六年所完成的课程。原来只有初中程度的轻工业部橡胶工业管理局处长陈自新，绝大部分课程的考试都是五分。北京矿业学院和铁道学院的老干部班办的较早，第一期学生现在已经在作毕业设计，今年初夏就要走上生产战线。
    为了培养更多的又红又专的老干部，掌握科学技术，在生产战线起骨干作用。全国一部分高等工科院校，现正在积极进行继续扩大招收老干部的准备工作。预计今年夏天将有更多的老干部到高等学校里去深造。
