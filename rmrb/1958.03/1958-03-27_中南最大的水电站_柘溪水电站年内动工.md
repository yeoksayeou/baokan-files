    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 26th: The Zhexi Hydropower Station on the Zi River in Hunan, with an engineering scale slightly smaller than the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, will officially begin construction this year. Currently, the preparatory office of the engineering bureau for the construction of this power station has been established, and various construction preparations are being accelerated.
    The Zhexi Hydropower Station is located in the Darongtang area of Anhua County, Hunan. It has an installed capacity of 396,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of more than 2.1 billion kilowatt-hours. It is scheduled to be completed and generate electricity in 1961. After the power station generates electricity, in addition to meeting the electricity needs of industrial production in cities such as Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Changsha, and Hengyang, and the central Hunan region, it can also meet the electricity needs of mechanical irrigation and drainage in rural areas of central Hunan and the Dongting Lake area. After the power station's reservoir is built, it can reduce the threat of floods to the vast lands downstream of the Zi River.

    中南最大的水电站——
    柘溪水电站年内动工
    据新华社长沙26日电　工程规模稍小于新安江水电站的湖南资水柘溪水电站今年内就要正式动工。现在，建设这个电站的工程局筹备处已经成立，各项建设准备工作正在加紧进行。
    柘溪水电站位于湖南安化县大溶塘地段，装机容量为三十九万六千瓩，年发电量二十一亿多度，预定在1961年建成发电。电站发电以后，除满足株洲、湘潭、长沙、衡阳等城市和湘中地区工业生产用电外，还可以满足湘中地区和洞庭湖区农村机械排灌的用电需要。电站的水库建成后，可减轻资水下游广大土地的洪水威胁。
