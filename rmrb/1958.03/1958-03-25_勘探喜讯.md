	Exploration Good News
	Large Molybdenum Mine Found in Qinling Mountains
	The Geological Exploration Team under the Shaanxi Provincial Office of the Ministry of Geology further explored the molybdenum mine in the Qinling Mountains last year. The molybdenum ore reserves they have discovered exceed the state's requirement for the reserves task submitted in 1957 by more than four times. According to various data and experts' estimations: this mine is one of the largest molybdenum deposits discovered in the world so far.
	Large Iron Mine Found in Xinyu
	A vast iron ore deposit has been proven in the Xinyu County area, Jiangxi Province, through a general survey by the Geological Exploration Team under the Jiangxi Office of the Ministry of Geology. This iron ore deposit has abundant reserves, estimated to be several hundred million tons based on current preliminary data alone; the exposed open-pit iron ore amounts to more than 50 million tons. The confirmed ore layers are two to three in number, with a thickness mostly exceeding ten meters, and some reaching about thirty meters.

    勘探喜讯
    秦岭有个大钼矿
    地质部陕西省办事处所属地质勘探队，去年进一步勘探秦岭的钼矿，他们已查获的钼矿储量，比国家要求1957年提交的储量任务超过了四倍。根据各方面的资料和专家们的估计：这个矿是目前世界上已发现的钼矿当中最大的矿床之一。
    新余有个大铁矿
    江西省新余县地区，经地质部江西办事处所属地质勘探队普查证明，有一个规模巨大的铁矿。这个铁矿储量丰富，仅据目前初步资料估计，便有几亿吨；暴露在地面的露天铁矿有五千多万吨。已证实的矿层有二至三层，厚度多在十公尺以上，有的厚达三十公尺左右。
