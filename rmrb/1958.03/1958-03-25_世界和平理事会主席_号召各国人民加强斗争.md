    Xinhua News Agency, Athens, March 23rd: TASS reported that the Chairman of the World Peace Council, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, in an interview with a reporter from "Avgi" (Dawn Daily), called on the people of all countries to strengthen the struggle against the atomic arms race, against the establishment of rocket bases, and for disarmament and cooperation among the people of all countries.

    Joliot-Curie emphasized that many parliaments and governments currently advocate stopping nuclear weapons testing and opposing the establishment of rocket bases. The plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe has gained broad support from social figures and political activists. Joliot-Curie said, "Public opinion can make disarmament and international cooperation prevail. The World Peace Council is also working towards this goal, and therefore it has decided to convene a conference on disarmament and international cooperation from July 16th to 22nd. This conference makes it possible for all peace advocates to exchange opinions and work experience. To achieve victory in the cause of peace, a path must be found that can express the will of the people of all countries. I firmly believe that 1958 will bring greater achievements to the cause of peace."

    世界和平理事会主席
    号召各国人民加强斗争
    据新华社24日讯　塔斯社雅典23日讯：世界和平理事会主席弗雷德里克·约里奥—居里对“黎明日报”记者发表谈话，号召各国人民为反对原子武器竞赛、反对建立火箭基地、争取裁军和各国人民之间的合作而加强斗争。
    约里奥—居里强调说，目前许多议会和政府都主张停止试验核武器，反对建立火箭基地。在欧洲建立无原子武器区的计划获得了社会人士和政治活动家的广泛支持。约里奥—居里说：“社会舆论能够使裁军和各国合作占优势。世界和平理事会也正是为了这个目标而努力，因此它决定在7月16日至22日召开裁军和国际合作问题会议。这个会议使一切和平拥护者有可能交换意见和工作经验。为了和平事业的胜利应该找到一条能够表达世界各国人民意志的道路。我深信，1958年会给争取和平的事业带来更大的成就。”
