Seas May Dry Up and Rocks May Crumble, But Our Resolve Will Never Waver
Li Jishen's Speech

Comrades!

Today's meeting is a promotion conference for the great leap forward in socialist self-remolding for our various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures. Here, we must solemnly declare to the people of the whole country: we are determined to hand our hearts over to the Communist Party, loyally accept the leadership of the Party, and resolutely take the road of socialism!

We are in a great new socialist era, where internationally, the East Wind is noticeably prevailing over the West Wind. In our great motherland, workers and peasants have launched a surge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, engaging in selfless labor for socialism. The cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds.

This situation powerfully encourages our democratic parties' determination and confidence in strengthening socialist self-remolding. We are all determined to be promoters, determined to unleash a great leap forward in our political and ideological self-remolding in the torrent of the national socialist great leap forward. We must all strive to transform our democratic parties from political parties of a bourgeois nature into political parties of a socialist nature as soon as possible, to make our members abandon the bourgeois standpoint and establish the working-class standpoint, undergoing a complete transformation and becoming true working people as soon as possible. Now, within our democratic party organizations, a high tide of comparing resolutions, comparing drive, and comparing remolding has formed, brimming with slogans of striving for "both red and expert," and "redness penetrating expertise." Under the impetus of the current favorable situation, as long as we are determined, muster our energy, catch up, and strive for the top, we will certainly be able to complete our organizational transformation and personal transformation targets and plans ahead of schedule and in excess, realizing the great policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

The Chinese Communist Party is the helmsman leading our people forward through the wind and waves, and it is the lighthouse of our democratic parties. At today's meeting, we guarantee to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao: we will forever unswervingly follow the Communist Party forward and always be the Communist Party's faithful assistants; we will love what the Party loves and hate what the Party hates, and dedicate all our strength to the cause of socialism. Even if the seas dry up and the rocks crumble, no storms will ever shake this resolve.

We are determined to unite the thousands and thousands of hearts of the democratic party members into one heart, and dedicate this heart to the Party, to the people, and to socialism!

We are determined to dedicate our lives to the great socialist motherland and wage a resolute struggle against enemies at home and abroad!

We are determined to strive to make our members basically become leftists and middle-leftists in the shortest possible time, and to make the organizations of our democratic parties basically become political parties of a socialist nature!

Our democratic party members, whether in government offices, schools, or enterprises, must hand over all their knowledge and strength to the country, faithfully implement the Party and state policies and laws, excellently complete work tasks, and forever follow the progress of the times, so that we can achieve both redness and expertise as soon as possible.

We ask the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country to be our supervisors, constantly test our loyalty and determination, and urge us to move forward and forward again! To leap forward and leap forward again!

Let us shout:

Long live the victory of socialism!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the great Chairman Mao!

    李济深的讲话
    同志们！
    今天的大会，是我们各民主党派和无党派民主人士社会主义自我改造大跃进的促进大会。在这里，我们首先要庄严地向全国人民宣誓：我们决心把心交给共产党，忠诚地接受党的领导，坚决地走社会主义的道路！
    我们正处在一个伟大的社会主义新时代，国际上东风显著地压倒了西风，在我们伟大的祖国，工人、农民掀起了一片学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮，为社会主义进行着忘我的劳动。社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，正在万马奔腾、一日千里地前进。
    这个形势有力地鼓舞了我们民主党派加强社会主义自我改造的决心和信心。我们都决心当促进派，决心在全国社会主义大跃进的洪流中，使我们在政治上思想上的自我改造也来个大跃进。我们都要争取尽早地使我们民主党派从资产阶级性质的政党转变成为社会主义性质的政党，使我们的成员尽早地破资产阶级立场，立工人阶级立场，脱胎换骨，成为真正的劳动人民。现在，我们民主党派组织内，已经形成一个比决心、比干劲、比改造的高潮，洋溢着一片争取“又红又专”、“红透专深”的口号。在当前有力的形势推动下，只要我们下定决心，鼓起干劲，迎头赶上，力争上游，我们一定能够提前和超额完成我们所订出的组织改造和个人改造的指标和规划，实现在中国共产党领导下长期共存、互相监督的伟大方针！
    中国共产党是领导我们全国人民乘风破浪向前跃进的舵手，是我们民主党派的灯塔。我们在今天的大会上，向共产党和毛主席提出保证：我们永远坚定不移地跟着共产党前进，永远作共产党的忠实助手；党所好者好之，党所恶者恶之，为社会主义事业献出一切力量。海枯石烂，任何风浪，此志绝不动摇。
    我们决心把民主党派成员的千颗心，万颗心，联成一颗心，把这颗心献给党，献给人民，献给社会主义！
    我们决心把自己的生命献给伟大的社会主义祖国，同国内外敌人进行坚决的斗争！
    我们决心争取在最短时期内，使我们的成员基本上成为左派和中左分子，使我们民主党派的组织基本上成为社会主义性质的政党！
    我们民主党派的成员，无论在机关、学校、企业中，都要把全部知识和力量交给国家，忠实地执行党和国家政策法令，出色地完成工作任务，永远跟着时代前进，使自己尽早地做到又红又专。
    我们请党、请毛主席、请全国人民作我们的监誓人，随时考验我们的忠诚和决心，督促我们向前再向前！跃进再跃进！
    让我们高呼：
    社会主义胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛主席万岁！
