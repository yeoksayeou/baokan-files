    "Demand Grain from the Field Bottom"
    (Our Dispatch) This year, Luchuan County, Guangxi Province, plans to deep-plow more than 100,000 mu of land. At present, various places have begun to take action, and the slogan "Demand Grain from the Field Bottom" is resounding everywhere.
    The movement was first launched by the key Bintang Cooperative of the county Party committee. In late February, the cooperative summarized four major benefits of deep plowing: first, rice roots can grow deeper, making the seedlings strong; second, it can increase water and fertilizer retention capacity; third, it can make the soil loose; and fourth, the rice seedlings are not easy to lodge. By March 1, 658 mu had been deep-plowed, deepened by one to three inches. After setting an example, the Luchuan County Party Committee organized more than 360 cadres from various townships and cooperatives to visit Bintang Cooperative on March 2 to learn about deep-plowing experience.

    “向田底要粮”
    本报讯　广西省陆川县今年计划深耕十万亩地以上。目前各地已开始行动，到处响遍“向田底要粮”的口号。
    运动首先是县委重点湴塘社搞起来的。该社在2月下旬，总结出深耕有四大好处：一是禾根可向深处生长，使禾苗壮大；二能增加保水、保肥能力；三能使土层松软；四是禾苗不易倒伏。到3月1日止，已深耕了六百五十八亩，加深一至三寸。做出了榜样之后，陆川县委于3月2日，组织各乡社干部三百六十多人到湴塘社参观，学习深耕经验。
