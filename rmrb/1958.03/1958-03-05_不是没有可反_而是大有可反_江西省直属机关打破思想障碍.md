(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 4th dispatch) The directly subordinate organs of Jiangxi Province have broken through various ideological obstacles and are actively promoting the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

Among the directly subordinate organs of Jiangxi Province, a more common ideological obstacle is that some people believe there is nothing to oppose and are satisfied with the existing achievements of rectification. For example, in the relatively well-rectified Shipping Bureau, many people believe that there is nothing wasteful or conservative to oppose. However, once the masses were mobilized, problems were exposed. A big-character poster revealed that the bureau's material reserves had serious waste. The excess reserve in September last year alone amounted to more than 129,000 yuan; some materials exceeded the regulations by nearly 300%. The Agricultural Bureau had exposed more than 180,000 yuan of waste and backlog during the rectification, and the leadership thought it was almost done. Now, after letting go and mobilizing the masses, nearly one million yuan of backlog and waste has been exposed.

At present, a mass anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has initially taken shape. According to incomplete statistics, the big-character posters burning waste and conservatism reached more than 25,000 in the provincial directly subordinate organs in just three to five days. The Agricultural Bureau averaged five big-character posters per person, exposing many facts of waste and conservatism.

Through summarizing past experiences and lessons, all units have promptly launched a competition to compare leaps forward, compare drive, and compare redness and expertise, guiding cadres to actively improve their work. A cadre of the Agricultural Bureau issued a big-character poster entitled "It's Not Too Late to Correct Quickly," exposing that the cost plan and material supply plan of the Agricultural Machinery Factory in 1958 were out of sync, which would cause new waste. After discussion, the bureau immediately corrected it. The Civil Affairs Bureau planned an election expenditure of 60,000 yuan this year, but now it has decided to reduce it to 36,000 yuan, saving 24,000 yuan.

### 不是没有可反　而是大有可反  江西省直属机关打破思想障碍

    不是没有可反　而是大有可反
    江西省直属机关打破思想障碍
    本报南昌4日电　江西省直属各机关打破各种思想障碍，积极推进反浪费反保守运动。
    在江西省直属机关中，较普遍的思想障碍是某些人认为没有甚么可反和满足于整改的既有成绩。例如整改较好的航运厅，就有很多人认为没有甚么浪费和保守可反。但是一经发动群众，问题就暴露出来了。一张大字报揭发这个厅的材料储备有严重的浪费。仅去年9月份储备超额就达十二万九千多元；有的材料超过规定近300％。农业厅在整改中曾经揭发浪费积压十八万多元，领导上认为差不多了，现在放手发动群众，又揭发积压浪费近百万元。
    目前，群众性的反浪费反保守运动已初步形成。火烧浪费和保守的大字报，据不完全统计，只在三、五天中，省直属机关的大字报就达二万五千多张。农业厅平均每人写大字报五张，揭发出许多浪费和保守的事实。
    各单位通过总结过去的经验教训，都及时地开展比跃进、比干劲、比红专，引导干部积极改进工作。农业厅一个干部以“赶快纠正还来得及”为题出了一张大字报，揭发农业机械厂1958年成本计划与物资供应计划脱节将要造成新的浪费。这个厅经过讨论，立即加以纠正。民政厅计划今年选举经费六万元，现在决定减为三万六千元，节省经费二万四千元。
