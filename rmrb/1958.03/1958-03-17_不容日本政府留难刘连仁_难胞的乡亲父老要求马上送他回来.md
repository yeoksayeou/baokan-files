Do Not Allow the Japanese Government to Make Things Difficult for Liu Lianren
Fellow Villagers of the Compatriot Demand His Immediate Return

　　(Our newspaper, Gaomi, March 12th, reporter Xiao Yan) The family members, neighbors, and fellow sufferers of compatriot Liu Lianren have protested the Japanese government's attempt to treat Liu Lianren as an "illegal entrant" or "illegal resident," demanding that the Japanese government be responsible for immediately escorting Liu Lianren back to China and compensating him for the mental and material losses he suffered during his persecution.

　　The reporter visited Liu Lianren's hometown, Caobo Village, Jinggou Township, Gaomi County, Shandong Province (formerly Chaigou Township, Seventh District, Zhucheng County). Liu Lianren's family received a letter from Liu Lianren on February 16th. It was mailed on February 14th from Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. In the letter, he expressed to his family his desire to return to China immediately and reunite with them.

　　Many farmers in Caobo Village witnessed Liu Lianren being abducted by Japanese and puppet troops in October 1944 (lunar August). Among them were five neighbors, including Liu Lianke, Qiu Zeyou, and Wu Yuanji, who were captured at the same time but escaped and returned home without leaving the county. There were also fellow sufferers from nearby villages who were captured and forced into hard labor in the same coal mine as Liu Lianren in Japan.

　　Liu Lianren's younger brother, Liu Liandeng, recounted with indignation the difficult situation his family faced after his elder brother was captured: "Our family was poor. At that time, my father and three elder brothers supported our family of nine by working hard. After my elder brother was captured, the family became even more difficult. For more than ten years, my elderly mother had fortune tellers read the future of her son who had no news from abroad several times a year, and she often shed tears of sadness. Even when she was dying, she still remembered him." Liu Liandeng said with indignation: "The Japanese government must compensate us for our losses and send my brother home quickly! Our whole family can no longer tolerate the Japanese government's unreasonable obstruction of my elder brother!"

　　Qiu Xianjie, a sixty-eight-year-old farmer and neighbor of Liu Lianren's family, said angrily: "Liu Lianren is a very honest farmer. He was captured by Japanese soldiers while working in the fields. Why hasn't the Japanese government sent him back yet? How can they be so unreasonable!"

　　Liu Lianren's fellow sufferers Zhao Zhengong, Qin Jiliang, Dan Yiwen, and others (all laborers at the Showa Coal Mine) protested the Japanese government's attempt to delay Liu Lianren's repatriation to China by using "illegal entry" and "illegal stay" as excuses. Dan Yiwen also described to reporters some specific details of the Japanese Showa Coal Mine's maltreatment of laborers. He said: "I am from Zhugong Village, Gaomi County. I was one of the two hundred Chinese laborers captured by the Japanese army to work in the Showa Coal Mine, and I was in the same team as Liu Lianren. We were close and very familiar with each other, and I know all about his escape. Liu Lianren and four other laborers escaped at night in the summer of 1945 because they could not bear the abuse. The names of the four others were Chen Zongfu, Chen Guiqi, Du Guixiang, and Deng Zhuan, all from the Zhucheng County and Gaomi County area." Dan Yiwen concluded: "Like Liu Lianren, I am a witness to the Japanese imperialists' capture and abuse of laborers! I cannot tolerate the Japanese government's obstruction and persecution of my fellow sufferer Liu Lianren. I want to protest and demand that the Japanese government compensate Liu Lianren for his losses and send him back to China quickly!"

    不容日本政府留难刘连仁
    难胞的乡亲父老要求马上送他回来
    本报高密12日电　记者萧彦报道：难胞刘连仁的家属、邻居和难友纷纷抗议日本政府想把刘连仁作为“非法入境”或“非法逗留”处理的企图，要求日本政府负责立即护送刘连仁回国，并赔偿他遭受迫害期间的精神和物质损失。
    记者访问了刘连仁的家乡山东省高密县井沟乡草泊村（原属诸城县第七区柴沟乡）。刘连仁家中已于2月16日接到刘连仁的家信，这是2月14日从日本北海道札幌市寄来的。他在信中向家人表示了自己想立即回国和家人团聚的意愿。
    草泊村的许多农民，都是刘连仁在1944年10月（旧历八月）间被日伪军掳去的目睹者。其中就有同时被抓、未出县境即逃脱回家的邻居刘连科、丘泽友、吴元记等五人。附近村庄也有先后被抓往日本和刘连仁在同一煤矿做苦役的难友。
    刘连仁的弟弟刘连登激愤地叙述他大哥被抓后家境困难的情况：家里是贫农，那时靠着父亲和三个哥哥扛活养活全家九口，他大哥被抓去后，家中更困难了。十几年来老母亲每年都要为在外无音信的儿子算几次卦，经常伤心落泪，直到临死时还念念不忘。刘连登以愤慨的口吻说：“日本政府必须赔偿我们的损失，送我哥哥快回家！我们全家再也不能容忍日本政府对我大哥的无理留难！”
    刘连仁家的邻居六十八岁的农民丘贤杰气愤地说：“刘连仁是个很老实的庄稼汉。他是到地里干活时被日本兵抓走的。日本政府为啥至今还不快把他送回来？怎能这样不讲理！”
    刘连仁的难友赵振功、秦纪亮、单亦文等（他们都是昭和煤矿的劳工），都对日本政府企图以“非法入境”、“非法逗留”等办法拖延遣送刘连仁回国表示抗议。单亦文还对记者叙述了一些日本昭和煤矿虐待劳工的具体情况。他说：“我是咱高密县朱公村的，是日本军队抓往昭和煤矿二百名中国劳工的一个，而且和刘连仁在同一个小队里。我们二人常接近很熟，他逃跑的情形我全知道。刘连仁是不堪虐待和另外四个劳工在1945年夏天夜间逃跑的。那四人的名字是陈宗福、陈桂起、杜贵相、邓撰友，都是诸城县和高密县一带的人。”单亦文最后说：“我和刘连仁一样是日本帝国主义抓劳工、虐待劳工的见证人！我不能容忍日本政府对刘连仁难友的留难和迫害，我要抗议，要求日本政府向刘连仁赔偿损失，快送他回国！”
