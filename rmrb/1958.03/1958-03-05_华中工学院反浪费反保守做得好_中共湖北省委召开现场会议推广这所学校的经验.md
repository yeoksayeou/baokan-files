Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an on-site conference on the 1st and 2nd, gathering more than 2,000 people from various universities in the Wuhan area, including presidents, party secretaries, heads of trade unions and youth leagues, directors of teaching and research departments, and student representatives, to promote the experience of Huazhong Institute of Technology in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

In the past ten days, Huazhong Institute of Technology has held more than thirty exhibitions against waste and conservatism. According to the anti-waste exhibition on capital construction and teaching equipment, the waste and backlog in capital construction and teaching equipment at Huazhong Institute of Technology amounted to 7 million yuan. In addition, the school also held exhibitions on students' pursuit of a life of enjoyment, resulting in damage to public interests for personal gain, and exhibitions on "returning public property to home," etc. Many of those involved acted as commentators at various exhibitions, expressing their determination to correct their mistakes.

The main experiences of Huazhong Institute of Technology in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement are: First, to promptly eliminate ideological obstacles, so that the broad masses clearly understand the purpose of the movement. Second, leaders and key members took the lead in "setting themselves on fire," setting an example, and then held pilot exhibitions and mobilization meetings, so that the movement spread throughout the school within a few days. Once the movement was launched, the masses used various forms such as mass airing of views, great debates, big-character posters, and exhibitions to push the movement to a climax. At this time, the school leadership only needed to hold meetings on-site, organize everyone to visit, evaluate, and commend the advanced, which could further drive the entire school.

    华中工学院反浪费反保守做得好
    中共湖北省委召开现场会议推广这所学校的经验
    据新华社武汉4日电　中共湖北省委1日和2日召集武汉地区各高等院校的院校长、党委书记、工会和青年团负责人、各教研室主任、学生代表等二千多人，在华中工学院举行现场会议，推广这个学院反浪费反保守运动的经验。
    十天来，华中工学院举办了三十多个反浪费反保守的展览会。据基本建设和教学设备的反浪费展览会揭发，华中工学院在基本建设和教学设备等方面的浪费、积压达七百万元。另外学校还举办了学生贪图生活享受造成损公利己现象的展览会、“公物还家”展览会等。许多当事人在各种展览会上当解说员，表示决心改正错误。
    华中工学院的反浪费、反保守运动的主要经验是：第一，及时破除思想障碍，使广大群众明确了运动的目的。其次，领导人和骨干分子都带头引火烧身，作出榜样，再接着举行试点展览会和动员大会，使运动在几天之内就全校铺开。运动一经铺开，群众就运用了大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报、展览会等各种形式，把运动推向高潮。这时，学校的领导上只是到现场开会，组织大家参观、评比，表扬先进，就可以进一步带动全校。
