    在国际舆论压力下
    法政府不敢杀害布伊海德
    但仍然把她判处终身苦役
    新华社13日讯  巴黎消息：在全世界人民的抗议之下，法国政府终于被迫撤销了对阿尔及利亚爱国女青年加米拉·布伊海德判处死刑的决定。
    据法兰西全国最高司法会议今天宣布，法国政府已经决定把对加米拉·布伊海德判处死刑改为判处终身苦役。据宣布，这个决定是在12日举行的一次有法国总统戈蒂参加的全国最高司法会议上作出的。
    法国当局原定在3月7日处死加米拉·布伊海德，在此以前，曾经用酷刑折磨了她。当时，加米拉·布伊海德肩上还带有枪伤，伤口已感染结核菌。
    当加米拉·布伊海德被法国当局判处死刑时，她在法庭上毫不畏惧地高声大笑，并且对法庭审判官说：“不要忘记，你们杀死我也就是扼杀法国的自由传统！”
