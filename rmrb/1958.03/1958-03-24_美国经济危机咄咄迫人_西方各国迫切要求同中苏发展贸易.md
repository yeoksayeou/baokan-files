Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd. According to a TASS dispatch from Buenos Aires on the 22nd, the Argentine newspaper "Democracia" published a Santiago dispatch stating: "The establishment of the European market and the outbreak of the North American economic crisis, which has caused more than five million people to lose their jobs, have presented twenty Latin American republics with a dual task: to find new markets outside the Western world, in the People's Democracies; and to strive to establish new economic consortiums within regional markets."

The author of the dispatch believes that achieving these tasks in Chile is "even more urgent" because a crisis has already emerged in Chile's copper mining. Due to the decline in copper prices and oversupply in the capitalist world market, Chile must find markets for its raw material, copper, in socialist countries, otherwise "its economy is in danger of deteriorating."

The dispatch pointed out that the Argentine government had sent a large trade mission to the socialist camp countries, which had a great impact on the Chilean government and people from all walks of life. It said: "Now, even Chile's main newspaper, the mouthpiece of the Chilean Liberal Party, the notorious anti-communist newspaper 'El Mercurio,' which is loyal to the West, is publishing articles saying that it is necessary to trade with the Soviet Union."

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd. TASS, Montevideo, March 21st: Aranha, head of the Brazilian delegation to the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly, told a reporter from "Ultima Hora" that restoring relations with socialist countries would only benefit Brazil.

Aranha opposed using the term "Soviet infiltration" to scare Brazilians. He said, "I have not found any economic or financial offensive by the Soviet Union against Latin America."

Brazilian newspapers pointed out that the Brazilian public agreed with this statement. Many prominent social activists and politicians, including many Brazilian senators, support Aranha's statement. Senator Domingo Velasco said, "I completely agree with Aranha's statement. I think his statement is of great significance to Brazil."

Brazilian Congressman Fernando Ferrari pointed out that he also agreed with Aranha's attitude towards expanding Brazil's diplomatic relations.

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd. TASS, Rome, March 22nd: Italian Foreign Trade Minister Carli told a reporter from "Il Tempo" that in order to prevent the consequences of the US economic recession, Italy should resolutely seek sales outlets for its exports in all countries, especially in those countries that do not show signs of economic recession. He pointed out that due to the conclusion of new trade and payment agreements, Italy's exports to Eastern European countries, especially to the Soviet Union, will continue to increase.

Carli expressed concern about the phenomenon of the US economic recession. He said that this recession "indirectly affects the entire international trade system and may further lead to a reduction in Italy's exports to the United States and many other Western countries."

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd. TASS, Ottawa, March 21st: Birkinshaw, chairman of the Canadian Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce, said at the committee's annual meeting in Montreal, "In recent months, Britain and other Western European countries have once again demanded that the embargo list on China be reduced, if not abolished." Birkinshaw said that sending a Canadian trade mission to Beijing was "a step in the right direction." At the same time, Canada must further expand its trade with the Soviet Union.

Birkinshaw said that expanding trade is one of the best means for countries to build mutual understanding. He said, "In order to achieve coexistence, we should adopt a realistic attitude and let others live according to their wishes... Maximizing the scope of trade between all countries in the world is a good omen for the future."

    美国经济危机咄咄迫人
    西方各国迫切要求同中苏发展贸易
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯22日讯：阿根廷“民主报”刊载的一篇圣地亚哥通讯说：“欧洲市场的建立和造成五百多万人失业的北美经济危机的爆发，使得二十个拉丁美洲共和国面临双重任务：在西方世界之外，在人民民主国家，找寻新的市场；争取在区域性市场内建立新的经济联营”。
    通讯的作者认为，在智利实现这些任务是“更加迫切的事”，因为智利在铜的开采方面已经出现危机，由于资本主义世界市场上铜价下跌和供过于求，智利不得不在社会主义国家中找寻销售铜这种原料的市场，不然“它的经济就有恶化的危险”。
    通讯指出，阿根廷政府曾经派出一个庞大的贸易使团去社会主义阵营国家，这对智利政府和各阶层人士都产生了很大影响。它说：“现在连智利的主要报纸、智利自由党的喉舌、效忠西方的臭名远扬的反共报纸‘报信者报’刊登的文章也说，必须同苏联贸易。”
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社蒙得维的亚21日讯：出席联合国大会第十二届会议的巴西代表团团长阿兰纳对“最后一点钟报”记者发表谈话，强调指出巴西恢复同社会主义国家的关系只会给巴西带来好处。
    阿兰纳反对用“苏联渗入”这种说法来吓唬巴西人。他说，“我没有发现苏联对拉丁美洲有什么经济或财政性质的进攻。”
    巴西各报指出，巴西公众同意这个谈话。许多著名的社会活动家和政治家，其中包括巴西的许多参议员都赞成阿兰纳的谈话。参议员多明戈·维拉斯科说，“我完全同意阿兰纳的谈话。我认为，他的谈话对巴西有很大意义。”
    巴西众议员费尔南多·费拉里指出，他也赞同阿兰纳对扩大巴西外交关系问题的态度。
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社罗马22日讯：意大利对外贸易部长卡利对“时代报”记者说，为了防止美国经济萧条的后果，意大利应当在一切国家，特别是在那些没有经济萧条征象的国家，坚决地为意大利的出口寻找销路。他指出，由于缔结了新的贸易和支付协定，意大利对东欧国家，首先是对苏联的出口额将继续增加。
    卡利对美国经济萧条的现象表示担心。他说，这种萧条“间接地影响到整个国际贸易体系，并且可能进一步引起意大利向美国和向西方其他许多国家出口额的缩减”。
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社渥太华21日讯：国际商会加拿大委员会主席伯金休在蒙特利尔举行的委员会年会上说，“最近几个月，英国和其他西欧国家再次提出要求，主张即使不取消的话，也得缩小对中国的禁运货单。”伯金休说，派遣加拿大贸易使团到北京是向“正确方向迈出一步”。同时，加拿大必须进一步扩大和苏联的贸易。
    伯金休说，扩大贸易是各国建立相互谅解的最好手段之一。他说，“为了实现共处，我们应当采取现实的态度，让别人按照他们的意愿去生活……最大限度地扩大世界一切国家之间的贸易的范围，是未来的佳兆。”
