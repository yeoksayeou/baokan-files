Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 22nd. A strike wave is surging across France. According to newspaper reports, 15,000 employees of state-owned enterprises in Loriol, Brest, Saint-Étienne, and many other cities went on strike yesterday to protest the dismissal of workers and the reduction of working hours. In many instances, union organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the General Confederation of Labor-Force Ouvrière, and the French Confederation of Christian Workers have formed a united front to participate in the struggle.

At the call of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), workers at four machine manufacturing plants in Nancy also went on strike, demanding a 20% increase in wages and family allowances.

Thanks to the united action of union organizations participating in the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the General Confederation of Labor-Force Ouvrière, and the French Confederation of Christian Workers, construction workers in the Ardennes province have secured a 7% wage increase.

Despite repeated threats from the factory management against the striking workers, the 600 steelworkers at the "Red Earth Mining Company" in Audun-le-Tiche are continuing their strike.

The metallurgical industry union organization in the Pelfort area of Montbéliard has also called on workers to intensify their struggle for wage increases.

    法国卷起罢工浪潮
    出现三大工会结成统一战线的局面
    新华社巴黎22日电　在法国全国，罢工浪潮正在高涨。据报纸报道，罗利昂、布勒斯特、圣亚田和其他许多城市的国有企业的一万五千名职工昨天举行罢工，抗议解雇工人和削减工作时间。在许多场合下，隶属法国总工会、“工人力量”总工会和天主教劳工联盟的各个工会组织都结成统一阵线，参加斗争。
    在法国总工会的号召下，南锡的四个机器制造厂的工人也举行了罢工，要求提高工资和增加家属补助费20％。
    由于参加法国总工会、“工人力量”总工会和法国天主教劳工联盟的各个工会组织一致行动，阿登省建筑工人已经争取到提高工资7％。
    尽管厂方一再对罢工工人进行威胁，奥东勒提希“红土矿业公司”的六百名炼钢工人仍然坚持罢工。
    蒙特贝勒城培尔福地方的冶金业工会组织也号召工人加紧进行斗争争取增加工资。
