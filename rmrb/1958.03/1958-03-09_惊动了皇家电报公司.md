    Startled the Royal Cable Company
    The "inquiry telegrams" (used when the telegram's handwriting is unclear) between Shanghai and London originally took about 20 minutes for a reply from London and more than half an hour for a reply from Shanghai. In the midst of the call to "overtake Britain," the telegraph operators on the "London circuit" of the International Telegram Room of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, through their efforts, have now reduced the average time to reply to Britain's "inquiry telegrams" to just three minutes and eighteen seconds, about five times faster than Britain.
    This leap forward greatly surprised the telegraph operators of the British Royal Cable Company. Not long ago, they sent a telegram from London saying: "The speed of your reply to 'inquiry telegrams' is exciting. We will also find a way to be as fast as you."

    惊动了皇家电报公司
    上海伦敦之间的“简便公电”（查询电报字迹不清时用），本来，从伦敦复来，每次要二十分钟左右，由上海复去，需时半小时以上。在“赶过英国”声中，上海电报局国际报房“伦敦电路”的报务员经过努力，现在，回复英国的“简便公电”时间已平均只要三分十八秒，比英国约快五倍。
    这一跃进，使英国皇家电报公司的报务员大为惊奇。不久前他们从伦敦发来一份电报说：“你们‘简便公电’回复之迅速，令人兴奋。我们也要想法做到像你们一样快。”
