Xinhua News Agency Tianjin Telegram: Following the pioneering initiative of carrying out propaganda work competitions in grassroots units, Tianjin Municipality has recently launched a competition for branch work in grassroots units, promoting a comprehensive leap forward in the Party's branch work.

The new initiative was launched by the Chinese Communist Party branches of six factories, stores, and handicraft production cooperatives, including the No. 4 Tianjin Joint Private-Public Knitting Factory. They proposed that the Party's grassroots organizations are the headquarters of grassroots units and the driving force for promoting the leap forward in all work. The level of branch work must be further improved through competition to better play the role of a fighting fortress. The "Five Comparisons" competition conditions for branch work that they proposed are: compare collective leadership, compare cadre-masses relations, compare the role of Party members, compare socialist education, and compare production and business. After this initiative was put forward, it immediately exceeded the scope of factories, stores, and handicraft cooperatives, and many Party branches in institutions and schools also responded enthusiastically. To date, more than 1,170 grassroots units in the city have invested in this competition and the high tide of the Great Leap Forward.

Although the competition has only been launched for a short period of ten days, the branch work and Party member activities of many units have already shown a lively and brand-new situation. What is more prominent is that the collective leadership of the branches has been strengthened, and the fighting role of the branches has been brought into play. In the past, some branches rarely got together to seriously study problems because the committee members were scattered in various work sections and group production. Now, this phenomenon has been completely changed. The first branch of the Daxin Weaving Factory has improved the system of all committee members meeting once a week to analyze the ideological situation of the masses or study new problems that arise in the work so as to quickly solve them. On the 10th of this month, the factory demanded that the first work section increase the production of cotton cloth by 8,000 meters within 20 days, which was a very difficult task. The branch committee studied this on the same day and analyzed that there were three main problems in the current production: abnormal machine operation, insufficient labor, and unbalanced production processes. On the 12th, it began to mobilize all workers to tap production potential and carry out rush repairs on machines. Within four days, the problems in production were smoothly resolved.

A more common new atmosphere is that the enthusiasm of the majority of Party members has been rising, and their exemplary role among the masses has become more significant. Chen Guanli, a Party member of Yingxi Pharmaceutical Factory who has won the title of labor model or advanced producer for three consecutive years, has set up a personal plan to improve six tools within a year. After ten days of hard work, he has already improved the waxing tool and put it into production on the 19th, which doubled the work efficiency of sealing bottle mouths. The No. 3 workshop of Yufu Rubber Factory failed to complete the daily production plan in the first eight days of this month, owing 1,630 pairs of rubber shoes. Party member Li Ziyu proposed "fighting hard until the end of the month to change the backwardness of production." All workers actively responded, and five days later, not only made up for the arrears but also overproduced 1,730 pairs of rubber shoes. The relationship between many Party members and the masses has also become closer. In some units, there have also been scenes of Party members and the masses encouraging each other and posting big-character posters to praise each other.

    天津千余支部参加跃进竞赛
    不少单位的支部工作出现了生动活泼的新局面
    本报特约新华社天津电继基层单位开展宣传工作竞赛的创举之后，最近，天津市又发起了基层单位支部工作的竞赛，促使党的支部工作走上全面跃进的道路。
    新的倡议是公私合营第四针织厂等六个工厂、商店、手工业生产合作社的中共支部发起的。他们提出，党的基层组织是基层单位的司令部，是推动一切工作跃进的动力，必须通过竞赛进一步提高支部工作水平，更好地发挥战斗堡垒的作用。他们所提的支部工作“五比”竞赛的条件是：比集体领导、比干部群众化、比党员作用、比社会主义教育、比生产和业务。这一倡议提出以后，立即超出了工厂、商店、手工业社的范围，许多机关、学校的党支部也纷纷响应，到目前止，全市已有一千一百七十多个基层单位的党组织投入这一竞赛和跃进的高潮。
    竞赛开展虽然才短短十几天，许多单位的支部工作和党员活动已经出现了生动活泼气象一新的局面。比较突出的是支部的集体领导健全了，支部的战斗作用发挥了。过去有些支部由于委员分散在各个工段、小组生产，很少凑到一起认真地研究问题，现在，这种现象彻底改变了。大新织布厂第一支部已健全了全体委员每周碰头一次的制度，分析群众思想情况或研究工作中出现的新问题，以便迅速解决。本月10日，厂部要求第一工段在二十天内增产棉布八千公尺，任务相当艰巨。支委会在当天进行研究，分析出目前生产中存在着机器运转不正常、劳动力不足、工序生产不平衡三个主要问题，12日开始发动全体工人挖掘生产潜力和突击检修机器，四天之内使生产上的问题得到了顺利解决。
    更为普遍的新气象是广大党员的积极性高涨，在群众中的模范作用更加显著了，连续三年获得劳动模范或先进生产者称号的瀛西制药厂党员陈冠立，订出个人规划，要在一年内改进六项工具，他经过十天的刻苦钻研，已经改进了烫腊工具，19日投入了生产，使封瓶口的工作效率提高了一倍。裕蚨橡胶厂三车间在本月份的前八天不能完成日产量计划，欠产胶鞋一千六百三十双，党员李子玉提出“苦战到月底，改变生产的落后面貌”，全体工人积极响应，五天后，不但补上了欠数，还超产了胶鞋一千七百三十双。许多党员和群众的关系也更加密切了。有些单位还出现了党员和群众互相鼓励，互相出大字报表扬的场面。
