    Beijing Aviation Institute Launches Work-Study Program
    Teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute have come up with many ways to carry out work-study programs. One laboratory originally planned to accommodate over a hundred people in production; after actively contacting the local industrial bureau, it helped the Beijing Bicycle Factory produce 250,000 parts, greatly increasing production volume. In order to make full use of the machines, the students also actively proposed a two-shift production method. Technical workers among the students also actively signed up to participate in the trial production of machines. Some students also worked with teachers to design windmills, make electric meter cases, Boeing aircraft chassis, trial-produce eight-line oscillographs and resistance wires, etc. Thanks to the efforts of teachers and students, the number of students participating in industrial production has increased threefold compared to the past.

    北京航空学院开展勤工俭学活动
    北京航空学院的师生想出了很多办法，开展勤工俭学活动。有一个实验室原计划容纳百余人参加生产；经过主动和地方工业局联系后，帮北京自行车厂生产二十五万件零件，生产量大大提高。为了充分利用机器，同学们还主动提出生产两班倒的办法。学生中的技术工人还主动报名参加试制机器的工作。有的同学还配合教师设计风车，作电表壳、波音机底盘、试制八线录波器和电阻丝等。经过教师和同学的努力，学生参加工业生产的人数较前增加了三倍。
