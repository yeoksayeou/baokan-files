Vigorously Cultivate Genius Musicians

Three years ago, in a music room in Bucharest, everyone was rehearsing in the chorus, when suddenly a two-and-a-half-year-old girl's tone appeared. The professor immediately recognized the difference in this timbre; the tone was correct and very beautiful. It turned out that the little girl was Simina Popescu. The professor later learned that Simina could accurately repeat a tune on the piano at home, which was difficult even for some music middle school students.

In the winter before last year, Simina saw white snow falling outside the window, and a waltz-rhythm tune suddenly formed in her mind with musical notes: "Snowflakes Dancing." At this time, she was only four years old. Later, Simina was sent to study with famous composers and pianists, and the government also decided to grant this youngest composer in the country a scholarship.

This is just a small example of how the Romanian People's government discovers and cultivates genius musicians. In the years since Romania's liberation, a large-scale amateur music movement has been launched nationwide, and regional and national competitions have been held for talented young singers and performers of various folk instruments.

Anyone with musical talent can be sent to music school to study. In major cities in Romania, such as Bucharest, Iasi, Cluj, and Stalin City, there are secondary music schools. The best students in these schools also have the opportunity to pursue further studies at the highest institution – the Music Academy. The conditions at the Music Academy are very favorable. The Bucharest Music Academy has vocal and instrumental departments, as well as departments for composition, conducting, and education. There are more than 100 professors and lecturers and more than 300 students, including not only domestic students but also international students from China, Argentina, Bulgaria, and Albania. The state provides various scholarships to students with excellent grades, including one Republic Scholarship, three "George Enescu" Scholarships, and 134 ordinary scholarships. In addition, cash subsidies are given to 100 students with excellent grades.

Romanian musicians often participate in various international music competitions. Many musicians have become international celebrities, such as the singer Dan Iordăchescu, who won first prize at the 1956 Mozart Festival and the Geneva Singing Competition; and soprano Adula Lucaciu and bass Ladislau Konya, who both won gold medals at the International Youth and Students Festival competition held in Moscow last year.

From September 5th to 15th this year, the first "George Enescu" International Music Competition will be held in Bucharest. This competition is held to commemorate the great Romanian composer, conductor, pianist, and violinist. Romanian musicians are now actively practicing, preparing to show their skills in the competition.

### 大力培养天才音乐家

    大力培养天才音乐家
    三年前，在布加勒斯特的一间音乐室里，大家正在练习合唱，突然出现了一个两岁半的小女孩的声调。教授的耳朵一下子就辨出了这个音色的不同，这个音很正确并且很美。原来这个小女孩是西弥娜·波柏斯库，教授后来才知道，西弥娜在家时已能在钢琴上一点不错地重复一个曲调，而这个曲调对一些音乐中学的学生说来也是够难的。
    前年冬天，西弥娜看到窗外白雪纷纷落下，她的脑海里突然就用音符构成了一个圆舞曲节奏的曲调：“雪儿飘飘舞”，这时她才四岁。以后，西弥娜就被送到名作曲家和钢琴家那里去学习，政府还决定发给这个全国最年轻的作曲家助学金。
    这只是罗马尼亚人民政权发掘和培养天才音乐家的一个小例子。在罗马尼亚解放以后的年代里，全国展开了规模巨大的业余音乐运动，为年青的天才歌唱家和各种民间器乐演奏者举行了州区和全国性的比赛会。
    凡是有音乐天才的人都可能被送到音乐学校里去学习。在罗马尼亚各大城市，如布加勒斯特、雅西、克鲁什、斯大林城等地，都设有中等音乐学校。这些学校的高材生还有机会到最高学府——音乐学院深造。音乐学院的条件非常优越。在布加勒斯特音乐学院，设有声乐和器乐系，也有作曲、指挥、教育等系。这里有一百多位教授和讲师，学生三百多人，学生中不仅有本国人，还有中国和阿根廷、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等国的留学生。国家对成绩优良的学生发给各种奖学金，计有一个共和国奖学金名额，三个“乔治·艾乃斯库”奖学金名额，一百三十四个普通奖学金名额，此外还发给一百名优良成绩的学生现金补助。
    罗马尼亚的音乐家经常参加各种国际音乐比赛。很多音乐家成了国际上的名人，如歌唱家达恩·约得契斯库在1956年莫扎特音乐节和日内瓦歌唱比赛中获得了一等奖；女高音奥度拉·鲁卡丘和男低音拉第斯劳·康尼亚在去年莫斯科举行的国际青年学生联欢节比赛中都得了金质奖章。
    今年9月5日到15日在布加勒斯特将举行第一次“乔治·艾乃斯库”国际音乐比赛会。这次比赛是为了纪念这位伟大的罗马尼亚作曲家、指挥家、钢琴家和小提琴家而举行的。现在罗马尼亚的音乐家正在积极练习，准备在比赛中一显身手。
