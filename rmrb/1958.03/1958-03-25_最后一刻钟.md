Notes

    "The Last Quarter Hour"
    Lagrange recently boasted extensively about the "major victories" achieved by the French colonial army in Algeria. According to him, the war there has reached the "last quarter hour."
    People have heard Lagrange's grandiose statements countless times. Shortly after he became the Resident Minister of Algeria, he clamored that the war had reached the "last quarter hour." But what are the facts? Despite repeated reinforcements of the French colonial army, the "pacification" operations have suffered increasingly greater failures. The offensive launched by the Algerian National Liberation Army this spring has achieved great victories, and the French military authorities recently exclaimed that the situation was serious.
    Let Lagrange close his eyes to the facts and rave! The "last quarter hour" he expects will never arrive. What is coming is another "last quarter hour" – the "last quarter hour" of French colonial rule in Algeria.

    “最后一刻钟”
    拉戈斯特最近又大肆吹嘘法国殖民军队在阿尔及利亚所取得的“重大胜利”。据他说，那里的战争已经到了“最后一刻钟”。
    人们听到拉戈斯特的这种豪言壮语已经不知有多少次了。自从他当上阿尔及利亚驻节部长以后不久，他就叫嚷战争已经到了“最后一刻钟”。可是事实怎样呢？尽管法国殖民军队一再增援，“绥靖”行动还是遭到了越来越大的失败。阿尔及利亚民族解放军今年春季发动的攻势取得了巨大胜利，法国军事当局不久前就惊呼局势严重。
    让拉戈斯特在事实面前闭着眼睛去狂叫吧！他所期望的“最后一刻钟”是永远不会降临的。即将来到的是另一个“最后一刻钟”——法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治的“最后一刻钟”。
