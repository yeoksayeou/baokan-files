This newspaper reports from Nanchang on the 6th of March, courtesy of our reporters Zhang Pei and Li Lianbin: In the next five years, Jiangxi Province aims to develop one thousand mountain peaks. Using these one thousand peaks as bases, it will drive surrounding agricultural cooperatives to transform the barren mountainous regions of Jiangxi into prosperous socialist mountain areas. This is a heroic goal in Jiangxi Province's all-out Great Leap Forward.

The mountainous areas of Jiangxi account for more than 60% of the province's total area. Last winter's cadre transfer movement saw over 40,000 cadres, under the call of the Provincial Party Committee, courageously ascending those densely forested and sparsely populated mountain peaks along the narrow paths once trodden by the Red Army. To date, ninety-nine forestry or agriculture-based reclamation farms, primarily focused on forestry or agriculture, integrating forestry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing, have been established. Over the past two months, these socialist pioneers, under extremely difficult conditions, have initially settled in and formulated their 1958 development plans. Moreover, with a heroic spirit capable of swallowing mountains and rivers, they have proposed achieving a ten-year plan in five years, developing one farm into ten farms, and by 1962, establishing socialist development bases on one thousand mountain peaks, driving the mountain farmers around the bases. The glorious prospects of this great plan are: the province's reclaimed forestry area will reach 45 million mu (including 15 million mu driven by agricultural cooperatives), thus eliminating barren mountains and achieving greening throughout the province. All of the province's over 100 million mu of mountain forests (including the original 60 to 70 million mu) will be systematically managed and operated; all the resources of the mountainous areas will be utilized and developed step by step. Mountain areas will universally develop forestry and sideline product processing factories and workshops. By 1962, the output value of forestry and sideline industries in the mountainous areas will leap to 1.2 billion yuan, a fivefold increase compared to 200 million yuan in 1956, accounting for 30% of the total agricultural output value (currently less than 10%). In this way, the historically impoverished mountainous regions of Jiangxi will fundamentally change their appearance.

Recently, at the conference of farm managers held in Nanchang, the slogan "Run farms diligently and thriftily, work hard for three years" was put forward. The farms have successively formulated inspiring production plans to create experience and set an example for the Great Leap Forward. The development plans generally include the following aspects: 1. Establish bases for vegetables, feed, oil crops, and grain; 2. Plant trees and create forests, especially economic forests, to achieve greening; 3. Develop animal husbandry; 4. Utilize mountainous resources to establish small-scale industries and sideline businesses. They propose: All usable resources in the mountainous areas should be fully utilized.

In order to promote the construction of mountainous areas, all departments in Jiangxi Province are now actively cooperating with the Great Leap Forward in developing mountainous areas, providing manpower, material resources, and financial support. The highway from Taihe to Jinggang Mountain is being actively prepared for construction and will be open to traffic in the second half of this year. Postal and telecommunications, banking, and other units have already gone to the mountains or are preparing to do so. With the arrival of spring, this unprecedented great movement to develop mountainous areas will enter a new high tide.

### 变荒山为金银山  江西四万多干部在一千个山头上建立前进基地

    变荒山为金银山
    江西四万多干部在一千个山头上建立前进基地
    本报南昌6日电　记者张沛、李连斌报道：在五年以内，江西省要开垦一千个山头，以这一千个山头为基地，带动周围的农业社，把荒芜的江西山区建设成为社会主义的繁荣的山区。这是江西省在全面大跃进中一项英雄目标。
    江西的山区占全省面积的60％以上。去年冬季干部下放的运动在省委的号召下，四万多干部，英勇地沿着当年红军走过的羊肠小道，攀上了那些森林茂密、人烟罕见的山头。迄今为止，已经建立起九十九个以林业或农业为主的林、农、牧、渔垦殖场。两个月来，这批社会主义的拓荒者，在极其艰苦的条件下，已经初步安排好了“家务”，并且制定了1958年的开垦计划。不仅如此，他们还以气吞山河的英雄气概，提出十年计划五年实现，一个场发展为十个场，到1962年，在一千个山头上，建立起社会主义的开发基地，并把基地周围的山区农民带动起来。这个伟大规划的光辉前景是：全省垦殖的林业面积将达到四千五百万亩（内带动农业社垦殖的有一千五百万亩），这样，就能在全省范围内，消灭荒山，实现绿化。全省一亿多万亩的山林（内原有山林六千到七千万亩）都将有计划地管理和经营起来；全部山区的资源都将有步骤地利用和开发出来，山区将普遍发展林、副业加工厂和作坊，到1962年，山区林、副业的产值将跃进到十二亿元，比1956年的二亿元提高五倍，占农业总产值的30％（现在不到10％）。这样，素称贫穷的江西山区，将从根本上改变面貌。
    最近，在南昌举行的各垦殖场的场长会议上，提出了：勤俭办场，苦干三年的口号，各场纷纷制订了振奋人心的生产规划，为大跃进创造经验，作出榜样。开垦规划，一般包括这几个方面：一、建立蔬菜、饲料、油料、粮食基地；二、植树造林，特别是营造经济林，实现绿化；三、发展畜牧业；四、利用山区资源举办小型工业和副业。他们提出：山区可以利用的资源全部利用起来。
    为了促进山区的建设，现在江西省各部门都积极配合开发山区的大跃进，予山区以人力、物力和财力的支援，从泰和通往井冈山的公路正在积极准备修筑，今年下半年就可通车；邮电、银行等单位已经上山或准备上山。随着春天的到来，这个前无古人的开发山区的伟大运动，将进入新的高潮。
