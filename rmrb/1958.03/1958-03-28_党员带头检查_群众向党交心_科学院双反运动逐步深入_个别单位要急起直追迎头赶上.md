Party members take the lead in self-examination; the masses open their hearts to the Party.
Academy of Sciences Deepens the Double-Anti Movement
Individual Units Must Catch Up Quickly

(Our Dispatch) The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Double-Anti Movement in Beijing units has, on the basis of the big-character poster upsurge, gradually entered the stage of seminars, heart-to-heart talks, and in-depth ideological criticism. In units where the movement has progressed faster, ideological leaps forward are closely combined with work leaps forward, and unprecedented new atmospheres have emerged.

During the rectification campaign, the Institute of Geophysics created the experience of combining ideological leaps forward with work leaps forward. This experience has been promoted in various research units in Beijing. The characteristic of this experience is that communist party member leading personnel first conduct self-examinations, and then criticism and self-criticism are carried out among senior researchers, with ideological exchanges. Through small-scale seminars and debates, the bourgeois ideological styles and conservative backward ideas that had persisted for a long time among senior researchers were resolved. This eliminated the biggest obstacle to the development of scientific undertakings, greatly increased the enthusiasm of researchers, and enabled scientific work to develop rapidly.

The general steps of the movement at this stage are that each unit first has party member administrative leaders or party member scientists take the lead in self-examination. For example, Dai Fanglan, the director of the Institute of Microbiology and a communist party member, took the lead in examining his conservative thinking in training cadres at a general meeting of researchers in the entire institute, and proposed ways to improve in the future. Yin Da, the deputy director of the Institute of History and a communist party member, at a general meeting of all personnel in the institute, in addition to examining his bureaucratic work style of being busy but inefficient and his sluggishness, focused on examining the reasons why the banner of Marxist historiography had not been sufficiently clear in the institute in recent years. Wherever party members take the lead in inviting criticism and self-examination, concerns are eliminated more quickly, and the movement develops rapidly.

Under the lead of party members' self-examination and promotion, many non-party senior researchers are also eager for self-revolution. They realize that the bourgeois influence in their thinking is the biggest obstacle to the development of scientific undertakings and personal progress, and therefore actively request to conduct ideological self-examination. Lü Shuxiang, deputy director of the Institute of Linguistics, and Hua Luogeng, director of the Institute of Mathematics, have voluntarily signed up to request self-examination. An old scientist at the Institute of Geology said, "In the past, in previous movements, I never took the lead, never connected it to myself, and my original face did not change." Now, "I am determined to take off my false mask and show my true face." He feels that "today it seems that I have not contributed to the people, but rather owe them a debt."

Currently, various research institutes are holding various forms of heart-to-heart meetings. At these meetings, many scientists, on the basis of self-criticism, have launched mutual criticism, achieved ideological exchanges, and opened their hearts. An old scientist at the Institute of Botany examined himself at the meeting, saying that he was full of eight airs (official air, lavish air, arrogant air, delicate air, sluggish air, fame air, profit air, lazy air).

The old scientists' conscious action of conducting ideological self-examination has a great impact on young scientific workers. Some young scientific workers were influenced by the old scientists' thinking in the past and wanted to take the road of being only expert but not red. Now, seeing that the old scientists are still striving to transform themselves, they realize that they should transform themselves even more. Some young scientific workers were dissatisfied with the old scientists' ideological style in the past, and did not respect the old scientists in their hearts. Now, seeing the old scientists seriously examining themselves, their disrespect for the old scientists' thinking has also changed.

In units where the movement has developed relatively well, a lively political situation has emerged, and the relationship between party and non-party members, between scientists, and between new and old scientists is unprecedentedly harmonious.

On the basis of the ideological leap forward, they began to rectify while changing, comparing unity, comparing drive, and comparing advancement. Some units have already shown a new atmosphere of work leap forward. Comrades of the earthquake and geophysical exploration groups of the Institute of Geophysics set targets to increase work efficiency by one, two, or even ten times. The physical climate section of the climate group quickly solved the issue of business direction that had not been resolved for a long time, and formulated a specific implementation plan. The elemental analysis group of the central analysis laboratory of the Institute of Geology has begun to comprehensively carry out technological innovation to ensure that the task for one year is completed in three months. The spectral analysis group broke through the quota of analyzing 200 specimens in half a year to 4,800 specimens. The sedimentation laboratory put forward a plan to ensure that the twelve-year long-term plan for this science is achieved five years ahead of schedule. However, the development of the movement is still uneven. At present, some individual research units have not yet been well mobilized and need to catch up quickly.

Currently, the leaders of the Chinese Academy of Sciences are focusing on ideological issues, so that the struggle between the two roads and the two working methods can achieve a complete victory in the next stage of the Double-Anti Movement.

### 党员带头检查　群众向党交心  科学院双反运动逐步深入  个别单位要急起直追迎头赶上

    党员带头检查　群众向党交心
    科学院双反运动逐步深入
    个别单位要急起直追迎头赶上
    本报讯　中国科学院在京单位的双反运动，已在大字报鸣放高潮的基础上，逐步转入座谈、交心、深入思想批判的阶段。运动进展较快的单位，思想跃进和工作跃进紧密结合，已出现了前所未有的新气象。
    整风期间，地球物理研究所创造了思想跃进和工作跃进相结合的经验，这一经验已在北京的各研究单位推行。这个经验的特点是，由共产党员领导人员首先检查，然后在高级研究人员中开展批评和自我批评，思想见面。通过小型座谈会和辩论会，解决了高级研究人员中过去长时期存留下来的资产阶级思想作风和保守落后思想。这样就扫除了科学事业发展上的最大障碍，使研究人员的积极性大大提高，使科学工作得以迅速发展。
    这一阶段运动的一般步骤是各单位首先由党员行政领导或党员科学家带头检查。例如真菌植物所所长共产党员戴芳澜，带头在全所研究人员大会上检查了自己在培养干部中的保守思想，并提出了今后改进的办法。历史研究所一所副所长共产党员尹达在全所人员大会上，除了检查自己在工作作风中存在着忙忙碌碌的官僚主义和拖拉暮气的现象，并着重检查了几年来在该所马克思主义史学旗帜打得不够鲜明的原因。凡是党员带头引火烧身、自我检查的地方，顾虑消除较快，运动开展迅速。
    在党员的带头检查和推动下，许多非党高级研究人员也迫切要求自我革命，他们意识到自己思想中的资产阶级影响，是发展科学事业和个人进步的最大障碍，因而主动要求进行思想检查。语言研究所副所长吕叔湘，数学研究所所长华罗庚，已自动报名要求检查。地质研究所一位老科学家表示：“过去历次运动都没有首当其冲，从未联系自己，原来的面目没有改变”，现在“决心把自己的假面目揭下来，把真面目拿出来”。觉得“今天看来自己不是对人民有贡献，而是负了债”。
    目前，各研究所正在分别召开各种形式的交心会。在这些会上，许多科学家以自我批评为基础，展开了相互批评，作到思想见面，把心交出。植物研究所一位老科学家在会上检查，说他自己八气俱全（官气、阔气、骄气、娇气、暮气、名气、利气、懒气）。
    老科学家这种自觉地进行思想检查的行动，对青年科学工作者有很大的影响。有些青年科学工作者，过去受了老科学家的思想影响，想走只专不红的道路。现在他们看到老科学家还力求改造，觉悟到自己更应当改造。有些青年科学工作者过去不满意老科学家的思想作风，内心里对老科学家不尊重，现在看到老科学家认真检查，他们不尊重老科学家的思想也起了变化。
    在运动开展得比较好的单位，已经出现了生动活泼的政治局面，党和非党之间，科学家和科学家之间，新老科学家之间的关系空前融洽。
    在思想跃进的基础上，开始边整边改，比团结，比干劲，比先进。有些单位已经出现了工作跃进的新气象。地球物理研究所地震、物探组的同志定出提高工作效率一倍、二倍以至十倍的指标。气候组的物理气候部分迅速地解决了以前长期没有解决的业务方向问题，并订出了具体执行计划。地质研究所中心分析室的元素分析组已着手全面进行技术革新，保证一年任务三个月完成。光谱分析组由半年分析二百块标本的定额突破到四千八百块。沉积室提出了保证这门科学的十二年远景规划提前五年实现的规划。但是运动的发展还不平衡，目前有个别研究单位还未很好动员起来，需要急起直追，迎头赶上。
    目前中国科学院的领导正在抓紧思想问题，使两条道路和两种工作方法的斗争，在双反运动的下一阶段取得彻底的胜利。
