Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th. Academic Secretary of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Academician Topchiev, recently stated that Soviet science has already taken first place in the world in some very important sectors. The construction of the first atomic power station, intercontinental ballistic rockets, artificial Earth satellites, atomic icebreakers, and Tu-104 and Tu-114 aircraft are proof of this point.

    Topchiev made this statement in an article published in the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia." He said that the construction of artificial Earth satellites is based on the latest achievements in various and extremely different scientific and technological sectors, and is due to the fact that the Soviet Union possesses highly developed industry and top-notch scientists in mechanics, mathematics, physics, metallurgy, radio engineering, electronics, and other scientific sectors.

    The launch in 1957 of the world's largest particle accelerator—the ten billion electron volt synchrophasotron—is one of the most important achievements in theoretical and engineering implementation departments. There are now hundreds of types of isotope instruments used in Soviet industry. The work of Soviet scientists in polymer chemistry has opened up enormous prospects. At the same time, Soviet scientists have made outstanding achievements in semiconductors, dynamics, automation, and remote control mechanics.

    Topchiev said that computing technology is extremely promising in the development of science and production. The Soviet Union has already built machines that can automatically translate one language into another. Soviet geologists have discovered some new treasures using the latest exploration methods. The recent discovery of a diamond deposit with reserves exceeding all currently known diamond mines in the world, and the newly discovered sources of combustible gas can shift the center of gravity of the Soviet Union's entire energy consumption from coal to cheaper liquid fuels and gas within the next few years.

    Speaking of the reasons for these achievements, Topchiev pointed out that this is because Lenin's party has been extremely concerned about scientific undertakings and scientists since the earliest days of the victory of the October Revolution. He said that from January 1954 to January 1958, the staff of the scientific institutions of the Soviet Academy of Sciences increased by 19,000 people, and the budget increased by 49%. In the past four years, dozens of new scientific institutions have been established under the Academy of Sciences system alone. The Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, established in 1957 with twelve research institutes, is expected to play a major role in the development of science.

    苏联科学攀登世界顶峰
    许多重要的部门已居第一位
    新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联科学院学术秘书长托普切夫院士最近说，苏联科学在一些很重要的部门中已经占世界第一位。第一座原子能发电站、洲际弹道火箭、人造地球卫星、原子能破冰船、“图一○四”式和“图一一四”式飞机的制成就是这一点的证明。
    托普切夫是在苏联“消息报”上发表文章谈到这一点的。他说，人造地球卫星的制成是以各种各样极不相同的科学技术部门的最新成就为基础的，是由于苏联拥有高度发达的工业，由于在力学、数学、物理学、冶金学、无线电工学、电子学和其它科学部门拥有头等的科学家。
    1957年世界最大的粒子加速器——一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器开始运转，是理论部门以及工程体现部门最重要的成就之一。现在苏联工业中运用的同位素仪器已经有好几百种。苏联科学家在聚合物化学方面的工作打开了巨大的前景。同时，苏联科学家在半导体、动力学、自动化、遥控力学方面取得了卓越的成就。
    托普切夫说，计算技术在发展科学和生产方面是极有前途的。苏联已经制成了可以把一种语言自动译成另一种语言的机器。苏联地质学家用最新勘探方法发现了一些新的宝藏。前不久发现了一个储量超过目前世界上已知的一切金刚石矿的金刚石矿床，而新发现的可燃气体来源可以使苏联整个动力消费量的重心在近几年内就从煤转移到比较便宜的液体燃料和煤气方面。
    谈到取得这些成就的原因时，托普切夫指出，这是因为列宁的党从十月革命胜利的最初日子起就极其关怀科学事业和科学家。他说，从1954年1月到1958年1月，苏联科学院各科学机构的工作人员就增加了一万九千人，预算增加了49％。四年来仅在科学院系统下新成立的科学机构就有好几十个。1957年建立的、拥有十二个研究所的苏联科学院西伯利亚总分院，预计将对科学的发展起重大的作用。
