　　Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Moscow (TASS dispatch, March 27th): The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on March 26 regarding Comrade Khrushchev's report on the further development of the collective farm system and the reorganization of machine tractor stations.

　　The resolution believes that the proposals of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee on the further development of the collective farm system and the reorganization of machine tractor stations are correct and timely. These measures are of paramount importance to socialist agriculture and the country as a whole. After realizing the collectivization of agriculture according to Lenin's cooperative plan, the implementation of these measures will be a new and extremely significant step in the development of socialist agriculture.

　　The plenary session decided to submit the issue of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations to the next session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for discussion. The plenary session approved the appointment of the First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Khrushchev, as the rapporteur on this issue.

　　The plenary session considered it appropriate to hold a nationwide public discussion before submitting this issue to the Supreme Soviet session. The outline of Khrushchev's report "On Further Developing the Collective Farm System and Reorganizing Machine Tractor Stations" will be published for public discussion.

　　The plenary session also considered it appropriate to convene the Third All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Members in early 1959. The congress will discuss urgent issues related to collective farm construction and make necessary revisions to the model charter of collective farms.

　　The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session first talked about the achievements made by various sectors of the Soviet national economy in its resolution. The resolution pointed out that in the two years since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, industrial output has increased by 22%, heavy industry output has increased by nearly 24%, national income has increased by 18%, and the actual income of workers and staff (calculated on the average per working person) has increased by 10%. The reorganization of industrial management has promoted the thorough implementation and creative development of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism in economic construction, further enhanced the role of party organizations, Soviet organs, and trade union organizations at all levels in the republics and localities in leading enterprises and construction, and attracted more millions of workers and staff to participate in production management, creating conditions for the further rapid upsurge of the socialist economy.

　　The struggle for a great leap forward in agriculture launched by the people of the whole country after the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee has greatly increased agricultural and livestock production. This struggle marks the beginning of a new stage in the development of the collective farm system. The reclamation of vast areas of wasteland in the east has greatly expanded the base of the grain economy, enabling the total grain harvest of our country in the past four years to increase by 27% compared with the previous four years.

　　The persistent efforts of the Party and the people have eliminated the long-standing backwardness of animal husbandry. The task of increasing the milk yield of collective farm cows and increasing milk procurement volumes within six years, as proposed by the January 1955 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, has been completed ahead of schedule in three years.

　　On the basis of the prosperity of the collective farm economy, the collective farms' public accumulation funds increased from 63.1 billion rubles at the beginning of 1953 to 98.6 billion rubles at the beginning of 1957. Last year, the cash and in-kind income received by collective farm members from the collective and private economies, calculated on the average per working person, increased by 33% compared with 1953 (calculated at comparable prices).

　　In the past four years, the number of tractors, combines, trucks, and other modern machines equipped for agriculture has increased by half to one times compared with the previous four years. In the past four years, domestic agriculture has received 900,800 tractors (each with 15 horsepower), as well as many other agricultural machines.

　　The Party has dispatched tens of thousands of Party members to collective farms to do leadership work. By the beginning of 1957, more than 90% of collective farm chairmen were Communist Party members, and more than one-third of collective farm chairmen had received higher and secondary specialized education. The grassroots party organizations in collective farms have also grown and consolidated.

　　The resolution then stated that under modern conditions, the collective farm public economy has been raised to a new and higher stage, which is characterized by: the merged and expanded collective farms in recent years have become economically stronger, multi-departmental economies with many skilled cadres and strong technical equipment. Their income has greatly increased, and the welfare of farm members has improved. Increasing the material interests of collective farmers, implementing a new planning system, and authorizing collective farms to revise the model charter of collective farms in light of local conditions - all of this has brought into play the creative initiative of farm members, improved their labor enthusiasm, and made them more concerned about better use of land and technology and all the potential of collective farm production. Collective farm cadres have accumulated rich experience in operating large-scale public economies using new technologies and scientific achievements.

　　The resolution said when mentioning machine tractor stations, in the establishment and consolidation of the collective farm system, in equipping agriculture with technology, and in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, machine tractor stations have played a huge historical role. In the first stage of building collective farms, the Party considered machine tractor stations to be the most appropriate form for the state to help collective farms consolidate their public economies at that time.

　　Machine tractor stations are a huge political and organizational force, which unites peasants into collective farms with itself as the core, and makes them realize the superiority of large-scale mechanized agriculture. The technological progress of agriculture, the transformation of agriculture on the basis of new technologies, the training of skilled machine operator cadres, the improvement of cultivation levels, and the development of animal husbandry are all realized through machine tractor stations.

　　The great significance of machine tractor stations also lies in the fact that they are an important source of obtaining grain and other foods as well as industrial raw materials.

　　In recent years, machine tractor stations have become a huge organizational force in the struggle to eliminate the backwardness of individual sectors of agricultural production and to implement the Party's resolutions on agricultural issues.

　　The resolution said that under the current conditions, most collective farms have been consolidated organizationally and economically, and the collective farm economy has also developed greatly. Therefore, the existing form of providing production and technical assistance to collective farms through machine tractor stations is no longer adapted to the needs of the development of agricultural productive forces. Moreover, in many cases, this form has begun to hinder the further improvement of advanced collective farms and to restrain the initiative of collective farm cadres and all farm members to better develop the production potential of collective farms. The adverse effects of the situation where two socialist enterprises—collective farms and machine tractor stations—operate on the same piece of land are increasing, often causing a phenomenon of no one being responsible for production arrangements and reducing the sense of responsibility for increasing yield per unit area, resulting in great wasteful waste in maintaining two parallel and duplicate management institutions. In this case, the machine tractor stations have accumulated a large amount of technical equipment that they do not need, and the utilization rate of the machines is very low.

　　The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session believes that in order to further the upsurge of Soviet socialist agriculture and to develop the collective farm system, it is appropriate to change the current system of supplying technology to collective farm production and to gradually reorganize machine tractor stations. Machine tractor stations have played a huge and positive role, and now they have fulfilled their basic role in many ways. Now that most collective farms have the ability to purchase and can rationally and more effectively use tractors, harvesting combines, and other agricultural machines, it is appropriate to sell these machines directly to collective farms. This will enable them to better utilize modern technology, accelerate the technological progress of agriculture, increase labor productivity, increase total production and commodity production per hundred hectares of agricultural land, and reduce their costs.

　　Machine tractor stations should be reorganized into technical repair stations within different time limits, taking into account the characteristics of various regions and collective farms. Their task is to ensure the repair of tractors and other machines, provide technical assistance to collective farms, and supply (through sales) new technologies, spare parts, fuel, fertilizers, chemical contact poisons, and other materials to collective farms and state farms. In some areas, not all collective farms have the possibility to purchase tractors and other machines, and more importantly, they cannot yet rationally use this technology. In these areas, the current system of providing production technical assistance to these collective farms through machine tractor stations should be temporarily preserved.

　　The resolution said that selling tractors and other agricultural machines to collective farms and reorganizing machine tractor stations will strengthen the direct economic link between industry and agriculture, further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and prosper the collective farm economy, which will promote better use of land belonging to all the people that is permanently used by collective farms. On this basis, it will be possible to increase public accumulation funds and strengthen the links between collective farms, which is an important condition for strengthening and developing collective ownership, which will promote the raising of collective ownership to the level of ownership by the whole people.

　　The resolution said that the measures proposed in further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations are an integral part of the Party's work in improving the management of the national economy and improving its leadership. The implementation of these measures will raise the leadership of agriculture to a new and higher stage. The reorganization of machine tractor stations and the reorganization of management work in industry and construction that has been implemented in recent times will ensure the maximum utilization of the superiority and production potential of the socialist economic system, further develop the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the masses, and accelerate the pace of Soviet society towards communism.

　　In its resolution, the CPSU Central Committee instructed the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various republics and Party committees and grassroots organizations at all levels to widely explain the significance of the proposed measures and to organize nationwide discussions of Comrade Khrushchev's report outline in various localities. Party organizations and Soviet organs should carefully study and summarize all the specific suggestions of the working people in order to find the most appropriate and most suitable organizational form for reorganizing the material and technical supply of collective farms.

　　In the process of nationwide discussion, Party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations should bring into play the creativity and enthusiasm of all the working people to complete and overfulfill the state plan.

　　The resolution also instructed Party organizations and Soviet organs at all levels to determine the appropriate time for collective farms to implement these measures after thoroughly studying the economy of various regions and collective farms.

　　The resolution concluded by saying that the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee is firmly convinced that all the working people will actively participate in the nationwide discussion and strive to truly implement the various measures for a new upsurge in socialist agriculture. This upsurge will be another major victory for our country in the peaceful economic competition between socialism and capitalism and in solving the tasks of communist construction.

　　Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Moscow (TASS dispatch, March 27th): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session from February 25th to 26th. The plenary session listened to and discussed Comrade Khrushchev's report on "Further Developing the Collective Farm System and Reorganizing Machine Tractor Stations."

　　苏共中央委员会全体会议通过决议
    进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组拖拉机站
    在提交最高苏维埃讨论之前将在全国举行全民讨论
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议26日就赫鲁晓夫同志的报告通过了关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的决议。
    决议认为，苏共中央主席团关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的建议是正确的和适时的。这些措施对于社会主义农业和全国具有头等重要的意义。在根据列宁的合作化计划实现了农业的集体化以后，实现这些措施将是发展社会主义农业的新的、极端重大的步骤。
    全会决定把关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的问题提交苏联最高苏维埃下次会议讨论。全会批准由苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫作这个问题的报告人。
    全会认为，在把这个问题提交最高苏维埃会议讨论之前，在全国举行全民讨论是适宜的。赫鲁晓夫“关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的报告提纲将予以公布，供全民讨论。
    全会还认为，在1959年初召开第三届全苏集体农庄庄员大会是适宜的，大会将讨论有关集体农庄建设的迫切问题，并对集体农庄示范章程作出必要的修改。
    苏共中央全会在决议中首先谈到了苏联国民经济各部门所取得的成就。决议指出，苏共第二十次代表大会后的两年来，工业的产量提高了22％，重工业产量几乎提高了24％，国民收入增加了18％，职工的实际收入（按参加工作的人平均计算）增加了10％。工业管理的改组促进了列宁的民主集中制原则在经济建设中的彻底贯彻和创造性的发展，进一步提高了各加盟共和国、地方的党组织、苏维埃机关和工会组织在领导企业和建筑业中的作用，吸引了更多的千百万职工参加生产管理，为社会主义经济的进一步迅速高涨创造了条件。
    全国人民在苏共中央1953年9月全会以后展开的争取农业大跃进的斗争大大地增加了农业和畜牧业的生产，这个斗争标志着集体农庄制度发展中新阶段的开端。东部大片荒地的开垦大大地扩大了谷物经济的基地，使我国近四年的谷物总收成能够比前四年增加了27％。
    党和人民坚持不懈的努力消除了畜牧业长期存在的落后现象。苏共中央1955年1月全会所提出的在六年内提高集体农庄奶牛挤奶量和增加牛奶采购量的任务已经提前在三年中完成了。
    在集体农庄经济繁荣的基础上，集体农庄的公积金从1953年年初的六百三十一亿卢布，增加到1957年年初的九百八十六亿卢布。去年集体农庄庄员从公有经济和私人经济所得到的现金和实物收入，按参加劳动的人平均计算，比1953年增加了33％（按比较价格计算）。
    近四年来，农业所装备的拖拉机、联合收割机、载重汽车和其他现代化机器的数量比前四年增加了一半到一倍。在近四年内国内农业得到了九十万零八千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计），以及许多其他农业机器。
    党派出了成千上万的党员到集体农庄去做领导工作。到1957年初集体农庄主席中有90％以上是共产党员，有三分之一以上的集体农庄主席受过高等和中等专门教育。集体农庄的基层党组织也成长和巩固了。
    决议接着说，在现代条件下，集体农庄公有经济提高到了新的更高阶段，新阶段的特点是：合并扩大的集体农庄在近几年中已经成为拥有很多熟练干部的、经济实力更强的、多部门的、技术装备雄厚的经济，它们的收入大大增加了，农庄庄员的福利提高了。提高集体农民的物质利益、实行新的计划制度、授权集体农庄结合当地条件修改集体农庄示范章程——这一切发挥了庄员的创造性主动性，提高了他们的劳动积极性，使他们更加关心更好地使用土地和技术以及集体农庄生产的一切潜力。集体农庄干部在运用新技术和科学成就经营大规模公有经济方面积累了丰富的经验。
    决议在提到机器拖拉机站的时候说，在建立和巩固集体农庄制度方面，在以技术来装备农业方面，在巩固工农联盟方面，机器拖拉机站起了巨大的历史作用。在建设集体农庄第一阶段中，党认为机器拖拉机站是当时国家帮助集体农庄巩固它们公有经济的最适宜的形式。
    机器拖拉机站是一支巨大的政治力量和组织力量，它以自己作为核心，把农民团结到集体农庄里，并且使他们体会到大机器农业的优越性。农业的技术进步、农业在新技术基础上的改造，培养熟练的机器操使干部、提高耕作水平和发展畜牧业等，都是通过机器拖拉机站而实现的。
    机器拖拉机站的巨大意义还在于，它们是获得粮食和其他食品以及工业原料的重要来源。
    近年来机器拖拉机站成了在争取消灭农业生产个别部门的落后现象和实现党关于农业问题的决议的斗争中的巨大组织力量。
    决议说，在目前的条件下，大多数集体农庄在组织上和经济上得到了巩固，集体农庄的经济也有了很大发展，因此，现存的通过机器拖拉机站向集体农庄进行生产和技术帮助的形式就不再适应农业生产力发展的需要。不但如此，在很多情况下这种形式已经开始妨碍先进的集体农庄的进一步提高和束缚集体农庄干部和全体庄员更好地发挥集体农庄生产潜力的主动性。在同一块土地上有两个社会主义企业——集体农庄和机器拖拉机站进行经营，这种情况所产生的坏影响越来越大了，这种情况常常造成生产安排中的无人负责现象并且降低提高单位面积产量的责任心，造成维持两个平行重复的管理机构的很大的无谓浪费。在这种情况下，机器拖拉机站积压了大量它们用不着的技术设备，机器的利用率很低。
    苏共中央全会认为，为了苏联社会主义农业的进一步高涨，为了集体农庄制度的发展，改变现行的集体农庄生产技术供应制度和逐步改组机器拖拉机站是适宜的。机器拖拉机站曾起过巨大的良好作用，而现在它在许多方面已经实现了它的基本作用。现在，当大多数集体农庄有能力购买而且可以合理地、更有成效地使用拖拉机、收获联合机和其他农业机器的时候，把这些机器直接转卖给集体农庄是适宜的。这就可以使他们更好地运用现代技术、加速农业的技术进步，提高劳动生产率，增加按每百公顷农业用地计算的总生产量和商品生产量，并降低其成本。
    机器拖拉机站应当考虑到各地区和各集体农庄的特点在不同的期限内改组为技术修理站，其任务是保证修理拖拉机和其他机器，向集体农庄提供技术帮助，为集体农庄和国营农场供应（通过出售办法）新技术、备件、燃料、肥料、化学接触毒剂和其他物资。在某些地区，还不是所有集体农庄都有可能购买拖拉机和其他机器，而主要的是，它们还不能合理运用这种技术，在这些地区，应当暂时保存现行的、通过机器拖拉机站给这些集体农庄以生产技术帮助的制度。
    决议说，向集体农庄出售拖拉机和其他农业机器以及改组机器拖拉机站，将加强工农业之间在经济上的直接联系，进一步加强工农联盟，繁荣集体农庄经济，将促使更好地利用永远归集体农庄使用的属于全体人民的土地。在这种基础上，将可以增加公积金和加强各集体农庄间的联系，这是加强和发展集体所有制的重要条件，它将促使集体所有制提高到全民所有制的水平。
    决议说，在进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站方面所提出的措施，是党在改进对国民经济的管理和改善对它的领导方面的工作的组成部分。这些措施的实现将使对农业的领导提高到新的、更高的阶段。机器拖拉机站的改组和最近时期所实行的工业和建筑业的管理工作的改组，将保证最大限度地利用社会主义经济制度的优越性和生产潜力，进一步发展群众的创造性主动性和积极性，加快苏维埃社会向共产主义迈进的速度。
    苏共中央在决议中责成各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会以及各级党委会和党的基层组织广泛解释所拟定的措施的意义，并在各地组织对赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲的全民讨论。党组织和苏维埃机关应当仔细地研究和总结劳动人民的所有具体建议，以便找出改组对集体农庄的物质技术供应的最妥善的、最适宜的组织形式。
    在全民讨论过程中，党、苏维埃、工会和共青团组织应当发挥全体劳动人民的创造性和积极性来完成和超额完成国家计划。
    决议还责成各级党组织和苏维埃机关在深入研究各地区和集体农庄的经济以后确定集体农庄实现这些措施的适当时机。
    决议最后说，苏共中央全体会议坚信，全体劳动人民一定会积极参加全民讨论，为真正实现社会主义农业新高涨的各项措施而奋斗。这种高涨将是我国在社会主义和资本主义的和平经济竞赛中、在解决共产主义建设的任务中的又一次重大胜利。
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会2月25日到26日举行了全体会议。全会听取和讨论了赫鲁晓夫同志的
  “关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的报告。
