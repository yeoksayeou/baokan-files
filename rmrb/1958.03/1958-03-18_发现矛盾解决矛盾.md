    Discover Contradictions, Resolve Contradictions

    Reservoirs have been built, and water has been stored, but a new contradiction has emerged: many areas lack sufficient water lifting tools, and the role of water conservancy projects cannot be fully utilized. The Cangxian Special District did not stop in the face of achievements. They immediately seized this new contradiction, mobilized the masses to create and improve more than 100 kinds and more than 30,000 pieces of water lifting tools, and resolved this contradiction. This is precisely the skill that we who do rural work and all other work must learn. We must be good at discovering contradictions and resolving contradictions in the great leap forward situation where one upsurge follows another. This is also the main driving force for constantly organizing upsurges and promoting upsurges; and resolving every contradiction is impossible without the power of the masses. Some people encounter contradictions, for example, they encounter a shortage of water lifting tools, and they look upwards, seeking assistance from higher levels and the state, instead of looking downwards, seeking assistance from the masses. Another valuable aspect of the Cangxian Special District's experience lies in relying on the masses to resolve contradictions.

    发现矛盾解决矛盾
    水库修起来了，水蓄起来了，可是一个新的矛盾又产生了：很多地区缺乏足够的提水工具，不能充分发挥水利工程的作用。沧县专区没有在成绩面前停下脚来，他们马上抓住了这个新的矛盾，发动群众创造和改进了一百多种、三万多件提水工具，把这个矛盾解决了。这正是我们做农村工作和其他一切工作的人必须学会的本事。要善于在一个高潮紧接一个高潮的大跃进形势中发现矛盾，解决矛盾。这也是不断组织高潮，促进高潮的主要动力；而解决每一个矛盾，离开了群众的力量也是无能为力的。有些人碰到了矛盾，例如说碰到了提水工具不足，就眼睛向上，向上级向国家求援，而不是眼睛向下，向群众求援。沧县专区经验的又一可贵处，正在于依靠群众来解决矛盾。
