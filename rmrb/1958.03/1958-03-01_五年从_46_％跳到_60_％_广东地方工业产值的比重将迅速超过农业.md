Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th - Local industry in Guangdong Province will experience tremendous development during the Second Five-Year Plan. The proportion of the total output value of local industry in the province's total industrial and agricultural output value will increase from 46.5% last year to 60%. Upon completion of this plan, the province's sugar production will reach 1.6 million tons, the production of canned fruits and vegetables will increase from 10,000 tons to 65,000 tons, and the production of machine-made paper and pulp will increase from 80,000 tons to 370,000 tons. In terms of heavy industry, many new factories and mines will also be built, vigorously developing underground resources and developing hydroelectric power.

In order to realize this great leap forward plan, the leading organs and industrial departments in various regions have recently revised this year's plan time and time again. Guangzhou City originally planned to increase the total output value of local industry by 4.55% this year compared with last year. After several revisions, it has now increased to 17.33%. Foshan City, which has always been relatively developed in industry, has proposed a great leap forward plan for this year in which the total industrial output value, the output of major products, and the profits turned over to the state will all increase by 50% compared with last year. Zhanjiang, Huiyang, Gaoyao, and Shaoguan Special Districts, and Shantou City have all proposed that the total industrial output value this year will increase by more than 50% to 60% compared with last year. The Hainan region originally planned to increase the total industrial output value by only 15% to 20% this year compared with last year, but recently, after revision, it has also been raised to 54%.

In organizing the great leap forward in local industrial production, various regions have focused on serving agricultural production and vigorously improving product quality, based on local characteristics. During the Second Five-Year Plan, various regions will build a large number of small and dispersed agricultural and sideline product processing plants. In order to improve the quality of industrial products, the vast majority of products in Guangzhou City have already formulated improvement plans. Among them, the quality of many products such as diesel engines, gas engines, transformers, gas lamps, inks, and rubber shoes will catch up with the advanced level of Shanghai this year. Industrial departments in Shantou, Foshan and other places have also formulated plans for various products to catch up with advanced levels in stages.

    五年从46％跳到60％
    广东地方工业产值的比重将迅速超过农业
    新华社广州27日电　广东省地方工业在第二个五年计划期间将有巨大发展。地方工业总产值在全省工农业总产值中所占的比重，将由去年的46.5％上升到60％。完成这一计划，全省食糖产量就将达到一百六十万吨，水果蔬菜罐头的产量将由一万吨提高到六万五千吨，机制纸和纸浆将由八万吨提高到三十七万吨。在重工业方面，也将新建许多厂矿，大力开发地下资源和发展水利发电。
    为了实现这一跃进计划，各地领导机关和工业主管部门最近一次又一次地修改了今年的计划。广州市原订今年地方工业总产值比去年增长4.55％，经过几次修改，现在已增长到17.33％。工业一向比较发达的佛山市，提出了今年在工业总产值、主要产品产量和上交利润三个方面都比去年增长50％的大跃进计划。湛江、惠阳、高要、韶关专区和汕头市，都分别提出今年工业总产值比去年增长50％到60％以上。海南地区原订计划今年工业总产值只比去年增长15％到20％，最近经过修订，也提高到了54％。
    各地在组织地方工业生产跃进中，根据地方特点，特别抓住了为农业生产服务和大力提高产品质量的两个关键问题。在第二个五年计划内，各地都将兴建大批小型分散的农副产品加工厂。为了提高工业产品的质量，广州市的绝大多数产品已经制订出改进规划，其中柴油机、煤气机、变压器、汽灯、墨水、胶鞋等许多产品的质量，将要在今年内赶上上海先进水平。汕头、佛山等地的工业部门，也纷纷订出了各种产品分期赶上先进水平的计划。
