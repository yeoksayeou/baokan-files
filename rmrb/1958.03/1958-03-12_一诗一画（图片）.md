    A Poem and a Painting
    Poem by Zuo Hai, Painting by Zong Qixiang
    Suddenly hearing the newsboy's call on the street, the red scarf reflects a beaming face.
    Every holiday they compete for duty, thrifty in study, diligent in work, a five-good student.
        [Note] Five-good means good in studies, good in conduct, good in health, good in labor, and good in thrift.

    一诗一画
    左海诗  宗其香画
    忽听街头卖报声，领巾红映脸盈盈。
    每逢假日争轮值，俭学勤工五好生。
        〔注〕五好是学习好、品行好、身体好、劳动好、节约好。
