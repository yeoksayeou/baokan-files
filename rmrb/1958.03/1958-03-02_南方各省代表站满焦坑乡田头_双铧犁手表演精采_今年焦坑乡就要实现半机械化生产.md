Xinhua News Agency, Huangyan, 1st: All representatives attending the Southern Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow Modification Evaluation and Promotion Experience Exchange Meeting and the Zhejiang Provincial Farm Implement Work Conference watched double-share plowmen's operating performances in Jiaokeng Township, Huangyan County, on February 26th.

Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province Wu Xian, and others also visited together.

In a field of just over one mu, female plow operator Lin Zhaolian demonstrated the operation of plowing the second plowing. The double-wheel double-share plow she used had undergone "three modifications." She used this plow to smoothly plow in paddy fields with mud feet as deep as five inches. Her hands didn't hold the plow; she simply walked on the left side of the plow, waving a thin bamboo stick, urging the two not-so-large oxen to move forward with the plow. Lin Zhaolian started using the double-share plow in the spring of 1956 and can now plow more than ten mu a day. She told the representatives, "For the first plowing without irrigation, the double-share plow doesn't need to be modified at all; in the second plowing with irrigation, replacing the modified parts solves the problem of the plow wheel sinking."

The representatives then watched male plow operator Chen A'huai's demonstration of the brilliant techniques of using a double-share plow to plow and create ridges, and plow the edges and corners of the fields. The representatives praised it highly.

During the breaks in the plowmen's operation performances, the single-wheel plow transport frame created by Yang Ruiqing and Wang Guoyi, technicians from the Xinyang Agricultural Machinery Experiment Station in Henan Province, attracted the representatives. This transport frame, made for only a few yuan, could be installed on the plow by one person in a few minutes, allowing the plow to be pushed forward on field paths. The representatives believed that with this gadget, the problem of transporting plows could be solved even in places where field roads could not be built for the time being.

Xinhua News Agency, Huangyan, 1st: Jiaokeng Township, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, which has made great achievements in promoting double-wheel double-share plows, plans to basically achieve semi-mechanized production this year. They require that: in addition to using water pumps for irrigation in some farmland, wooden plows and rice threshing barrels must be eliminated, double-wheel double-share plows and paddy plows must be used for all paddy fields, and rice must be threshed entirely with rice threshing machines. The township had already bought back eight double-wheel double-share plows in mid-February and had also ordered a large number of new-style farm implements and machinery. According to the plan, including the original and newly purchased, the township will have 117 double-share plows, 95 paddy plows, 139 rice threshing machines, and 15 water pumps this year, which will meet the needs of plowing and threshing more than 9,000 mu of paddy fields. To facilitate the use of new-style farm implements, agricultural cooperatives are also carrying out simple land planning and building roads in the fields. At present, the township has more than 70 newly built and previously built roads.

The farmers of Jiaokeng Township all agreed to deduct more from the public accumulation fund to purchase new-style farm implements and machinery, realize semi-mechanized production in the entire township, and strive for a great leap forward in this year's production. (Attached picture)

Fang Wenxin, a member of the Tuanshi Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, is only eighteen years old this year and is an excellent double-share plowman who can plow with two double-share plows.

    南方各省代表站满焦坑乡田头
    双铧犁手表演精采
    今年焦坑乡就要实现半机械化生产
    新华社黄岩1日电　出席南方双轮双铧犁改装评比和推广使用经验交流会以及浙江省农具工作会议的全体代表， 2月26日到黄岩县焦坑乡观看了双铧犁手的操作表演。
    农业部部长廖鲁言、浙江省副省长吴宪等也在一起参观。
    在一丘一亩多的田里，女犁手林招莲表演了翻耕二翻田的操作。她使用的双轮双铧犁，是经过“三改装”的。她用这种犁在泥脚深达五寸的水田里顺利地耕起来。她两手没有扶犁，只是走在犁左边，挥着一根细长的竹稍，呵着两头不算大的黄牛跟犁前进。林招莲是1956年春天开始用双铧犁的，现在一天能耕十多亩。她对代表们说：“没有灌水的头翻田，双铧犁根本不用改装；在灌了水的二翻田里，换上改装的部件，便解决了犁轮下陷的问题。”
    代表们接着参观了男犁手陈阿怀表演的使用双铧犁翻耕作畦和耕田边田角的精采技术。代表们十分称赞。
    在犁手操作表演的间隙，河南省信阳农业机械试验站技术员杨瑞卿、王国义创造的独轮运犁架吸引了代表们，这个只花几元钱制造的运犁架，一个人用不了几分钟便可安在犁上，在田间小路推犁前进。代表们认为，有了这个玩艺儿，一时不能在田间修路的地方，运犁问题也解决了。
    据新华社黄岩1日电　推广双轮双铧犁取得很大成绩的浙江省黄岩县焦坑乡，计划在今年内基本上实现半机械化生产。他们要求做到：除部分农田用抽水机抽水灌溉外，还要消灭木犁和打稻桶，水田全部使用双轮双铧犁和水田犁翻耕，水稻全部使用打稻机脱粒。全乡已在2月中旬买回八部双轮双铧犁，还订购了大量新式农具和机械。按照计划，连原有带新买的，今年全乡将有一百一十七部双铧犁、九十五部水田犁、一百三十九台打稻机和十五部抽水机，这样便能满足九千多亩水田翻耕和脱粒的需要了。为了便于使用新式农具，各农业社还在进行简易土地规划和在田间修筑道路，目前全乡新修的和过去修的道路已有七十多条。
    焦坑乡农民都同意多扣一点公积金，购买新式农具和机械，实现全乡半机械化生产，力争今年的生产来个大跃进。（附图片）
