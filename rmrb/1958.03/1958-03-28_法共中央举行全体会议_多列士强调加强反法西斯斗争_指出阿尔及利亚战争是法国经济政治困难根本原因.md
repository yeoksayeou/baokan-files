Xinhua News Agency, March 27th, Paris dispatch: According to TASS, the French Communist Party Central Committee held a plenary session on the 25th. On that day, the meeting heard and discussed Marcel Servin's report on the political situation in France. French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez spoke at the meeting.

Servin pointed out that the policies of the reactionary ruling parties, especially the war in Algeria, are the cause of France's current economic and political difficulties. He also pointed out that the movement of the French people is constantly developing. In this regard, the Communist Party plays a particularly important role.

In discussing Servin's report, Thorez spoke. He said that the Algerian war is the root cause of France's economic difficulties, and the war costs 700 billion francs each year. The Algerian war also determines the political situation in France. The reactionary ruling groups are trying to expand the war at the cost of isolating France diplomatically and morally. This colonialist war policy is naturally a source of fascism.

Thorez pointed out that, in contrast to this, the actions of the masses are growing stronger, and the people are increasingly uneasy about the rampant sabotage activities. He said that workers and democrats correctly recognize that the united front means taking action. In this struggle, the Communist Party gloriously fulfills its responsibilities. Its ultimate goal is socialism, which is the broadest democracy. However, today it must naturally safeguard even limited and insufficient democratic freedoms, and strive to expand these democratic freedoms. The people who are engaged in the fight against fascism and against war are increasingly trusting the Communist Party, as evidenced by the various parliamentary by-elections.

Thorez emphasized that the struggle of the masses against fascism must be further strengthened. The attitude of the Socialist Party leaders is an obstacle to developing a united front and expanding the anti-fascist alliance, and this obstacle must be overcome.

Thorez solemnly declared that the Communist Party will mobilize the entire nation to block the path of fascist agitators and dictatorship worshippers. It supports any government that lives up to the wishes expressed by the people in the 1956 election.

Thorez finally advocated the establishment of a democratic government. In this government, the Communists must assume a share of the responsibility for implementing the common program it has drawn up with all Republicans.

    法共中央举行全体会议
    多列士强调加强反法西斯斗争
    指出阿尔及利亚战争是法国经济政治困难根本原因
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议在25日开幕。这一天，会议听取和讨论了马赛尔·赛尔文关于法国政治形势的报告。法国共产党总书记多列士在会上讲了话。
    赛尔文指出，反动的执政党的政策，特别是在阿尔及利亚的战争，是法国当前遭受经济困难和政治困难的原因。他还指出，法国人民群众的运动在不断发展。在这方面，共产党起着特别重要的作用。
    在讨论赛尔文的报告时，多列士讲了话。他说，阿尔及利亚战争是法国经济困难的根本原因，这个战争每年要耗费七千亿法郎。阿尔及利亚战争还决定法国的政治局势。执政的反动集团不惜使法国在外交上和道义上陷于孤立，而企图扩大战争。这种殖民主义的战争政策自然是法西斯主义的源泉。
    多列士指出，同这种情况对照的是：人民群众的行动日益壮大，人民对破坏分子的猖狂日益不安。他说，工人和民主人士正确地认识到：统一战线就意味着采取行动。在这场斗争中，共产党光荣地履行着自己的职责。它的最终目的是社会主义，也就是最广泛的民主。不过，今天它自然要维护即使是有限的和不充分的民主自由，并且要竭力扩大这种民主自由。投身反对法西斯和反对战争的人民，对共产党越来越信任，各次议会补缺选举就证明了这一点。
    多列士强调，必须进一步加强人民群众反对法西斯主义的斗争。社会党领导人的态度是发展统一战线和扩大反法西斯联盟的障碍，必须克服这种障碍。
    多列士郑重声明：共产党要动员全民族去堵住法西斯煽动者和独裁政权崇拜者的道路。它支持不辜负人民在1956年大选中所表达的愿望的任何一个政府。
    多列士最后主张建立一个民主政府。在这个政府中，共产党人要担负起执行它同一切共和主义者拟订的共同纲领的一份责任。
