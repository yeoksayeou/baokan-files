　　The story of the "Seven Sisters" is being spread on the construction site of the Ming Tombs Reservoir in the capital.

　　The names of the "Seven Sisters" are: Liu Shumin, Li Lianfang, Wang Sumin, Yan Shuqing, Li Guozhen, Zhang Shuqing, and Zhang Shuhua. They live in Dongyi Village, Changping District, Beijing, and are all members of the Shahe Agricultural Cooperative, with a junior high school education. The oldest is twenty years old, and the youngest is fifteen.

　　It was in mid-January this year when they heard the news about building the Ming Tombs Reservoir, and they decided to sign up to participate. Some elderly people knew about it and worriedly said, "Young people are just full of enthusiasm, they won't be able to do it for more than a few days, and they'll definitely run back!" The cooperative cadres also disagreed with them going. However, the girls were determined, and they applied to the cooperative cadres again and again. The fifth sister, Li Guozhen, wrote seven applications and pledges in a row. Finally, the girls' wishes were fulfilled.

　　In the severe winter season of about minus twenty degrees, the wind and sand howled on the construction site, and the cold was bone-chilling. But their enthusiasm overcame the severe cold, and they threw themselves into the battle like men. After a few days, they all had blisters on their feet, and their legs and shoulders were swollen. The leaders told them to do some light work, but no one wanted to. They finally walked the difficult road and became labor models on the construction site.

　　In labor, they were as united as one person. Whoever had any ideas would speak up, and when they encountered difficulties, they would help each other solve them. Zhang Shuhua was the youngest, and often encountered some difficulties in labor and life, so everyone helped her solve them. When she came to the construction site, her father was very worried, so everyone took special care of her. Her father felt relieved after he knew about it. They saw that the clothes, shoes, and socks of the male comrades were torn and they had to ask for leave to send them home for mending, so they thought: wouldn't that delay the construction of the reservoir? After discussing it, they wrote a few sentences on the blackboard: "Anyone whose clothes, shoes, and socks are torn and need mending, please send them to us!" Few words, but profound meaning. So far, they have mended more than ninety pieces of clothing and shoes for seventy or eighty people. In their spare time, they also insist on studying. They often read the reservoir newsletter and the Communist Youth League charter. Originally, they had a common beautiful wish: to become glorious members of the Communist Youth League when the reservoir is completed!

　　On the eve of the Spring Festival, at the award ceremony at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, they were the first to receive the "Advanced Collective" award. The fifth sister, Li Guozhen, also won the first prize for individuals. The eldest sister, Liu Shumin, also won the third prize for individuals.

　　The name of the "Seven Sisters" has thus spread on the construction site. (Attached photo)

    七姐妹
    傅军
    在首都十三陵水库工地上，传颂着“七姐妹”的故事。
    “七姐妹”的名字是：刘淑敏、李连芳、王素敏、阎淑清、李国珍、张淑清和张淑华。家住北京市昌平区东一村，都是沙河农业社的社员，高小文化程度。最大的二十岁，最小的十五岁。
    是今年1月中旬的时候，她们听到了要修十三陵水库的消息，就决心报名参加。一些老年人知道了，就很耽心地说：“年轻人就是一股热情，干不了几天，准要跑回来！”社干部也不同意她们去。但是，姑娘们的决心已经下定了，她们一次再一次地向社干部提出申请，五姐李国珍一连写了七次申请书和决心书。终于，姑娘们的愿望实现了。
    零下二十度左右的严寒季节里，工地上风沙呼啸，寒气逼人。但她们的热情战胜了严寒，和男人一样投入了战斗。几天之后，她们个个脚上都起了泡，腿和肩也都肿了。领导上叫她们干些轻活，但谁也不愿意。她们，终于走过了艰难的道路，成了工地上的劳动先锋。
    在劳动中，她们团结得像一个人一样，谁有什么想法，就说出来，碰到困难，就相互帮助解决。张淑华最小，劳动和生活中常碰到一些困难，大伙就帮助她解决。来工地时，她父亲很不放心，因此大家特别关心她。她父亲知道后，心里就踏实了。她们看到男同志衣服、鞋、袜破了，要请假送回家去缝补，就想：这样不要耽误修水库吗？大伙商议了一下，就在黑板上写了这样几句：“谁的衣服、鞋、袜破了，要缝补，请送到我们这里来！”话不多，意义深长。到目前为止，她们已经给七、八十人缝补了九十多件衣服和鞋袜。工余时间，她们还坚持学习。经常读的东西是：水库小报和共青团团章。原来，她们有着一个共同的美好愿望：在水库建成的时候，都能成为一个光荣的共青团员！
    春节前夕，在十三陵水库工地评奖大会上，她们第一个获得了“先进集体”奖。五姐李国珍，还获得了个人一等奖。大姐刘淑敏也获得了个人三等奖。
    “七姐妹”的名字，就这样在工地传开了。（附图片）
