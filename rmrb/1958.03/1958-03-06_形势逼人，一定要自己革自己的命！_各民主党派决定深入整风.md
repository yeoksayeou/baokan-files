Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. The democratic parties and non-party democrats, at a recent bi-weekly symposium, after discussion and consultation, unanimously adopted the decision of the central committees of the democratic parties on further carrying out the rectification movement within the democratic parties. The full text is as follows:
I. Strive to Become Promoters of the Socialist Cause
Our country is in a great new era. Internationally, the East Wind is significantly prevailing over the West Wind. Our country's first Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled. A mass rectification movement has achieved great victory. On this basis, a vigorous anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has been launched. The people of the whole country are advancing with a hundredfold confidence, riding the wind and waves, pushing our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction to an unprecedented climax. Currently, a new atmosphere of socialist self-transformation has also emerged in industrial and commercial circles, intellectual circles, and democratic parties. Many people have formulated collective and individual transformation plans, and started mass movements of challenges, evaluations, and competitions, boosting their morale and declaring their determination to transform themselves from bourgeois elements into self-reliant laborers as soon as possible, and from bourgeois intellectuals into both red and expert working-class intellectuals, striving to be among the best in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The new situation of the national Great Leap Forward requires us democratic parties to wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, closely unite within the new united front serving socialism, fully utilize the current favorable conditions, accelerate fundamental self-transformation, further promote the socialist transformation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, become promoters of the socialist cause, and lay the political foundation for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Communist Party. This historical task is glorious and arduous.
Since June 1957, the struggle against the bourgeois rightists within the democratic parties has achieved a decisive victory. Having experienced this serious struggle between the two roads, the political and organizational features of the democratic parties have undergone new changes. The majority of members have received a profound socialist education, politically distinguishing themselves from the rightists, clarifying the fundamental issues of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and taking the socialist road, and the enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation has increased to varying degrees. The majority of members have taken a big step to the left in their political stance. The leaders and members of the democratic parties have gained important experience in the struggle. These have laid a good foundation for the democratic parties to further carry out the rectification movement. At present, generally speaking, the democratic parties are still bourgeois in nature. Although the rightist line has been strongly criticized, its influence has not been completely eliminated. The majority of members have not yet broken away from the intermediate state in politics. The democratic parties must seize the opportunity to carry out the rectification movement more universally and thoroughly in order to meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist cause. Politics is the commander and soul, and the rectification movement is precisely the necessary path for us to raise our political awareness, transform our political stance, and transform our thinking. Any negative, relaxed, or evasive ideas and practices that run counter to the current new situation are wrong. History sharply poses a question to every democratic party and every member: either rise up and catch up, and pass the socialist test well; or stagnate and be left behind by the wheels of the times. The situation is compelling, either this or that, if you don't advance, you retreat. This is the fundamental understanding we should have in the current rectification movement.

II. Promote Both Revolution and Unity
The general rectification policy and purpose of the democratic parties are to promote both revolution (socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts) and unity (unity – criticism – unity). The nature of the general rectification is still the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism. However, it has a fundamental difference from the anti-rightist struggle. It is a self-education and self-transformation movement within the people, for the purpose of curing diseases and saving people, and achieving the goal of strengthening unity on the basis of transforming positions and improving understanding.
The main tasks of the general rectification: for the organizations of the democratic parties, it is to thoroughly liquidate the influence of the rightist line, and further establish the line of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and truly serving socialism. For the members of the democratic parties, it is to further distinguish between the big rights and wrongs of the two roads, further transform their political positions, so that as many people as possible can advance a big step from their original basis to the position of the working class, resolutely accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the socialist road, and strive to achieve the following in action in the future: (1) Sincerely follow the Communist Party, and give their hearts; (2) Work actively, contribute their talents, and serve socialism wholeheartedly; (3) Actively and voluntarily improve the relationship of cooperation; (4) Strive to study politics and theory, and seriously carry out ideological transformation; (5) Learn from workers and peasants, establish a labor viewpoint, and actively cultivate the ideological feelings of the working people.

In addition to mainly achieving the above requirements, the general rectification of the democratic parties should also rectify the work style, improve work, and overcome the shortcomings of being divorced from reality and the masses. The leaders and key members of the democratic parties bear a major responsibility in the general rectification, and should play an active role in self-education and mutual education, both adopting a sincere and enthusiastic attitude to help others make progress, and humbly accepting the criticism of others, and seriously examining and earnestly correcting their own shortcomings and errors in political stance and work style.

III. Eight Issues for Democratic Parties to Conduct Rectification
Based on the existing experience of the democratic parties in carrying out general rectification, it is necessary to clarify the following issues:

(1) The steps for carrying out the general rectification can generally include:
(1) Summarize the gains and experiences of the anti-rightist struggle, study documents, launch informal talks, and carry out ideological mobilization.
(2) Great blooming and contending.
(3) According to the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, with reference to the fundamental issues debated in the democratic parties, intellectual circles, and industrial and commercial circles, and in connection with reality, carry out thematic debates, and conduct criticism and self-criticism in the debates.
(4) Rectification and reform: summarize the results of the democratic parties' examination of lines and policies; formulate plans and programs for improving the work of leading organs.
The above four steps are intertwined and should be carried out according to specific circumstances, without mechanical division and rigid uniformity.

(2) Formulating collective and individual transformation plans on a voluntary basis, and implementing evaluations and competitions, is an advanced form of promoting socialist self-transformation and consolidating the gains of rectification, which should be actively promoted, and through personal efforts, organizational assistance, mass supervision, and regular inspection and summarization.

(3) Great blooming, great contending, big-character posters, great debates, presenting facts, reasoning, criticism and self-criticism are the basic methods for carrying out general rectification, and these methods should be fully utilized to mobilize the masses. Attention should be paid to adopting flexible methods such as small-scale seminars, voluntary combinations, and heart-to-heart talks to repeatedly carry out ideological work, dispel concerns, and enlighten consciousness, so as to be both serious and earnest and gentle and mild.

(4) Do not adopt the method of "everyone passing the test," that is, passing one by one, do not force others to accept criticism, allow reservations of different opinions, do not make appraisals, and do not investigate history.

(5) Rightists who have already bowed their heads and confessed their crimes may be allowed to participate in general rectification, in order to continue to differentiate and transform them, so that the majority of people can further draw a clear line between themselves and the rightists politically and ideologically. If the rightists continue to spread poison and launch counterattacks, they should be resolutely repelled.

(6) For those who have been exposed during the general rectification to have had anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds, except for those whose circumstances are particularly serious and whose attitude is very bad, thereby causing public outrage among the majority, who should be labeled as rightists and treated as rightists, others may not be labeled as rightists and not treated as rightists, but should be subjected to serious criticism. For those who voluntarily expose their anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds, they should not be treated as rightists, and they should be encouraged and helped to conduct in-depth self-examination and determined to transform themselves. During the general rectification, if anyone takes the opportunity to engage in anti-Communism and anti-socialism, such people are current rightists and should be resolutely struggled against.

(7) Members of democratic parties in agencies, schools, and enterprises should actively participate in the rectification of their units in addition to participating in the internal rectification of democratic party organizations. If there are difficulties in scheduling, they can consult with the local CCP United Front Work Department and the relevant CCP committees of the units to help solve them.

(8) The general rectification is generally required to be completed by May of this year, and can be appropriately extended if necessary.

The general rectification of the democratic parties is related to the issue of the broad masses of members breaking capitalist positions and establishing socialist positions, and its nature is "revolutionizing oneself." Therefore, when carrying out this work, it is necessary to fully estimate its arduousness and complexity, and it is necessary to make the majority of people participating in the rectification accustomed to criticism and self-criticism through in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work, and truly feel that the rectification is beneficial to them, in order to be able to contribute to socialism with a comfortable mood and vigorous spirit. As long as we recognize that the rectification movement is a historical turning point for the democratic parties to achieve fundamental socialist transformation, dispel concerns, increase confidence, boost morale, and work hard, we will surely be able to successfully complete the great task of the rectification movement, and we will surely be able to make us advance and leap forward with the great motherland!

### 形势逼人，一定要自己革自己的命！  各民主党派决定深入整风

    形势逼人，一定要自己革自己的命！
    各民主党派决定深入整风
    新华社5日讯　各民主党派和无党派民主人士在最近一次的双周座谈会上，经过讨论协商，一致通过了各民主党派中央关于在各民主党派内部进一步开展整风运动的决定。全文如下：一　力争成为社会主义事业促进派
    我们国家正处在一个伟大的新时代，国际上东风显著地压倒了西风，我国第一个五年计划已经超额完成，全民整风运动获得巨大胜利，在这个基础上掀起了一个热火朝天的反浪费、反保守运动，全国人民正在以百倍信心，乘风破浪，把我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设推进到史无前例的高潮。目前在工商界、知识界和民主党派内也出现了社会主义自我改造的新气象，很多人纷纷制定集体的和个人的改造规划，开始了挑战、评比、竞赛的群众性运动，鼓足干劲，宣示决心，要把自己尽早从资产阶级分子改造成为自食其力的劳动者，从资产阶级知识分子改造成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子，在政治战线和思想战线的社会主义革命中力争上游。全国大跃进的新形势，要求我们各民主党派全心全意地接受中国共产党的领导，紧密地团结在新的为社会主义服务的统一战线内，充分运用当前的有利条件，加紧进行根本的自我改造，进一步推动资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子实现社会主义改造，成为社会主义事业的促进派，奠定同共产党长期共存、互相监督的政治基础。这一历史任务是光荣的，同时也是艰巨的。
    1957年6月以来，各民主党派内部开展的反击资产阶级右派的斗争，已经取得决定性的胜利。经历了这一场严肃的两条道路的斗争，各民主党派的政治面貌和组织面貌发生了新的变化。大多数成员受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，政治上和右派划清了敌我界限，在接受共产党领导和走社会主义道路的根本问题上辨明了大是大非，接受社会主义改造的积极性有了不同程度的增长，多数成员在政治立场上向左跨进了一大步。各民主党派的领导和成员在斗争中取得了重要的经验。这些，为各民主党派进一步开展整风运动打下了良好的基础。目前各民主党派总的说来，还是资产阶级性质的政党，右派路线虽然已经受到有力的批判，但是它的影响还没有彻底清除；大多数成员在政治上还没有摆脱中间状态。各民主党派必须抓紧时机，把整风运动更加普遍和深入地进行到底，才能适应我国社会主义事业大跃进的要求。政治是统帅、是灵魂，整风运动正是使我们提高政治觉悟、改造政治立场和改造思想的必经之路。任何与目前新形势相违背的消极、松劲、借故回避整风等想法和做法，都是错误的。历史向每一个民主党派和每一个成员尖锐地提出问题：或者是奋起直追，过好社会主义关；或者是停滞不前，被抛在时代车轮的后面。形势逼人，非此即彼，不进则退，这是我们在当前的整风运动中应有的根本认识。
    二　既要促进革命，又要促进团结
    各民主党派进行一般整风的方针和目的，是既要促进革命（政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命）、又要促进团结（团结——批评——团结）。一般整风的性质仍然是资本主义同社会主义两条道路的斗争。但是它同反右派斗争有着原则的区别，它是人民内部的自我教育、自我改造运动，是为着治病救人，在改造立场、提高认识的基础上达到加强团结的目的。
    一般整风的主要任务：对于民主党派的组织来说，是彻底清算右派路线的影响，进一步确立接受共产党领导、真正为社会主义服务的路线。对于民主党派的成员来说，是进一步辨明两条道路的大是大非，进一步改造政治立场，使尽可能多的人从原有基础上向工人阶级立场前进一大步，坚决接受共产党领导和走社会主义道路，在行动上今后力求做到：（1）真诚跟着共产党走，交出心来；（2）积极工作，贡献才能，全心全意为社会主义服务；（3）积极主动搞好共事合作关系；（4）努力学习政治、理论，认真进行思想改造；（5）向工人、农民学习，树立劳动观点，积极培养劳动人民的思想感情。
    民主党派的一般整风，除了主要地应当达到上述要求以外，同时也要整顿作风，改进工作，克服脱离实际，脱离群众的毛病。各民主党派的领导人员和骨干分子在一般整风中负有重大的责任，应当在自我教育，相互教育方面起积极作用，既要采取诚恳热情的态度，帮助别人进步，又要虚心接受别人的批评，对自己的政治立场和工作作风上的缺点和错误严肃检查、认真改正。三　各民主党派进行整风的八个问题
    根据各民主党派进行一般整风已有的经验，有必要明确下面几个问题：
      （一）进行一般整风的步骤，大体上可以包括：
      （1）总结反右派斗争的收获和体会，学习文件，展开漫谈，进行思想动员。
      （2）大鸣大放。
      （3）根据毛主席指示的六条政治标准，参照民主党派、知识界和工商界等方面辩论的根本性问题，联系实际，进行专题辩论，并且在辩论中开展批评和自我批评。
      （4）整改：总结民主党派检查路线、方针的结果；制定改进领导机关工作的方案和规划。
    上述四个步骤互有交叉，应当根据具体情况进行，不要机械划分，强求一律。
      （二）在自觉自愿基础上制定集体的和个人的改造规划，实行评比、竞赛，是当前促进社会主义自我改造、巩固整风收获的一种先进形式，应当积极倡导，并且通过个人努力、组织帮助、群众监督，定期检查、总结。
      （三）大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、摆事实、讲道理、批评和自我批评是进行一般整风的基本方法，应当充分运用这种方法，发动群众。要注意采取小型座谈、自愿结合、促膝谈心等灵活的方式，反复进行思想工作，解除顾虑，启发自觉。做到既要严肃认真又要和风细雨。
      （四）不采取“人人过关”即逐人通过的方式，不强迫别人接受批评，容许保留不同意见，不作鉴定，不追查历史。
      （五）可以准许已经低头认罪的右派分子参加一般整风。以利于对他们继续进行分化和改造，使大多数人从政治上、思想上进一步同右派划清界限。如果右派分子继续散播毒素、进行反扑，应当坚决予以回击。
      （六）对于在一般整风中，被揭发出来的曾经有过反共、反社会主义言行的人，除情节特别严重、态度很恶劣、因而引起多数人公愤的分子，应当戴上右派帽子，按右派分子对待以外，其他可以不戴右派帽子，不按右派分子对待，但是应当进行严肃的批判。对于主动揭发自己的反共、反社会主义言行的人，不作右派分子对待，鼓励和帮助他深入检讨，决心改造。在一般整风中，如果有人乘机进行反共、反社会主义，这种人是现行的右派分子，应该对他进行坚决的斗争。
      （七）机关、学校和企业中的民主党派成员，除参加民主党派组织内部的整风外，应当积极参加所在单位的整风，如果在时间安排上有困难，可以商请当地中共统战部门和有关单位的中共党委帮助解决。
      （八）一般整风大体上要求在今年5月内结束，必要时可以适当延长。
    各民主党派的一般整风，关系到广大成员破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场的问题，性质上是“自己革自己的命”。因此，在进行这一工作的时候，必须充分估计到它的艰巨和复杂，必须通过深入细致的政治思想工作，做到大多数参加整风的人，习惯于批评和自我批评，真正觉得整风对他有好处，是为了能够心情舒畅、精神奋发地为社会主义贡献力量。只要我们认清整风运动是各民主党派实现社会主义根本改造的历史转折点，解除顾虑，提高信心，鼓起干劲，努力以赴，就一定能够胜利完成整风运动的伟大任务，就一定能够使我们跟着伟大的祖国前进再前进，跃进再跃进！　1958年3月4日
