    Fight Well the First Battle of Agricultural Production!
    Sichuan: Winter Production Should Be Cleared Up; Spring Plowing and Sowing Should Not Be Delayed
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 9th: Spring plowing and sowing and the completion of winter production in Fushun County, Sichuan, are proceeding rapidly and in parallel. The county has basically completed early rice sowing and sweet potato planting; paddy fields have been plowed and harrowed ahead of schedule; the county has accumulated more than 90 billion jin of fertilizer, averaging more than 60,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of land; two-thirds of the more than 7,000 newly built ponds have been filled with water; and the water conservancy and irrigation network project, involving more than 300,000 laborers, is underway and will be basically completed by the end of March.
    This year, due to the realization of double-cropping rice, early rice sowing was advanced by half a month, and the remaining tasks from winter production are very heavy, so the labor force is particularly tight. Under the specific leadership of party organizations at all levels, more than 3,000 agricultural cooperatives in the county have mostly adopted the methods of professional division of labor, mobile blitzkrieg, and designated personnel to uniformly arrange and reasonably organize the labor force to solve this contradiction. After discussion by members, the twenty-four agricultural cooperatives in Sanqiao Township generally divided the labor force into four specialized groups, of which 25% are responsible for spring plowing and sowing, 20% for watering, 5% for accumulating and transporting fertilizer, and the rest are all invested in the construction of water conservancy and irrigation networks and soil improvement. Farmers repair water conservancy during the day and reclaim wasteland and water at night, with one specialized group doing the work of two. In this way, various productions can be carried out in an orderly and balanced manner. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives also adopt the method of dividing work to households and assigning responsibilities to individuals to ensure the quality of agricultural work.
    Shaanxi: Dali Completes Nearly Half of the Sixty-Day Spring Plowing Task
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th: Farmers in Dali County are launching a sixty-day campaign to make a big push in spring production. A scene of great leap forward appears everywhere. In the reservoir area of the Datuanjie Agricultural Cooperative east of the county seat, it is still crowded with people at night, working with lanterns and torches. The Tielian Five Cooperative in Hancun Township will dig a hundred-cart fertilizer pool for each team and a five-cart fertilizer pit for each household in sixty days. Nearly half of this sixty-day task has now been completed. Farmers in Duanjia Township, located in the Tielian Mountains, are determined to expand paddy fields by 25,000 mu and turn the Tielian Mountains into a crystal palace. At present, they have dug nine layers of ring wells from the foot of the mountain to the top.
    The secretary of the Dali County Party Committee and the county magistrates have gone to the fields to work, dividing up areas to be responsible for and leading the masses to engage in production together. The county party committee proposed that after sixty days, not only should advanced regions and advanced figures be evaluated, but also advanced leaders should be selected.
    Hunan: Dongting Lake Shore Plowing Cattle Galloping, Gang Plowing Deep Plowing Assembly Line Operation
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 9th: The season is urging people on, and farmers on the shore of Dongting Lake have started spring plowing more than a month earlier.
    Now, more than 80,000 plowing cattle are galloping and plowing in the fields every day. This year, a new method of "gang plowing" has appeared here: two plows in front and behind, one plow after another, plowing past, deepening the plowing by one time on the original basis. The "assembly line operation method" has also appeared: a group of people are watering, a group of people are sending fertilizer to the fields; after the girls spread the fertilizer evenly, the plows press the fertilizer down; immediately followed by harrowing. Everyone chases after each other, shouting and cheering in competition. Now most of the seedling fields have been fertilized with base fertilizer and leveled, just waiting for the vernal equinox to soak the seeds. More than 3 million mu of winter fallow land have also been plowed and harrowed two or three times, and one more time will be enough for transplanting.
    The high tide of the fertilizer accumulation movement on the lake shore has developed to advance towards the bottom of the lake. Every day, about 50,000 wooden boats scoop up more than 1.5 million dan of black grass fertilizer from the bottom of the lake. Farmers in Hanshou County dried more than 360 lake beaches with an area of more than 50,000 mu, and carried the black lake mud to the fields one dan at a time. Farmers in Changde, Hanshou, Taoyuan and other counties are leaping forward at a rate of increasing 20 dan of fertilizer per mu per day. Then there is transporting fertilizer to the fields. The Yanzui Cooperative in Changde County has more than 400 mu of distant fields that have been short of fertilizer and reduced production every year; this year they have newly opened a large canal more than 1,700 meters long that can be navigated by boats, and built plank roads on both sides of the canal, advancing on land and water in three routes, transporting fertilizer to the fields day and night, to make the low-yield fields produce a thousand jin of grain.
    Anhui: "No Big Net Can Catch Big Fish" Investment and Material Offering Formed a Wave
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th: In order to do a good job in spring plowing and production, agricultural cooperative members in various parts of Anhui proposed that "no big net can catch big fish," and set off a wave of investment and material offering. According to preliminary statistics from Fuyang, Bengbu, and Liu'an areas alone, members invested more than 9.77 million yuan in spring plowing and production. Farmers in Fuyang and Bengbu prefectures also offered 638,000 large trees and wood, 14.7 million bricks and adobe blocks, 210,000 jin of iron, 139,000 jin of hemp, and 4.5 million jin of grass as investment in the cooperatives.
    The members' investment and material offering have solved the difficult problems in spring plowing and production of many agricultural cooperatives. Taihe County plans to replant 310,000 mu of rice this spring, but lacks water buffalo; after mobilizing members to invest, agricultural cooperative members throughout the county have invested 570,000 yuan, which can buy 1,500 water buffalo. The Lianer Agricultural Cooperative in Funan County lacked 62 waterwheels, and the cooperative could not come up with so much money to rush to make them at one time. However, the members offered 82 large trees that could make 120 waterwheels, which completely overcame this difficulty. (Attached picture)

    打好农业生产头一仗！
    四川：冬季生产要扫尾   春耕春播不宜迟
    据新华社成都9日电　四川富顺县的春耕播种和冬季生产扫尾工作，正在紧张地齐头并举，迅速进行。全县早稻播种和甘薯下种工作已基本结束；水田已提前犁耙；全县共积肥九百多亿斤，每亩田平均可施肥六万斤以上；新修的七千多口塘，已有三分之二灌了水；投入了三十多万劳动力的水利灌溉网工程正在进行，到3月底就可基本完工。
    富顺县今年由于实现双季稻化，早稻播种提前半个月，冬季生产遗留下来的各项任务又很重，因此劳动力显得特别紧张。在各级党组织的具体领导下，全县三千多个农业社大都采取了专业分工、机动突击、专人负责的办法，统一安排和合理组织劳动力，来解决这个矛盾。三桥乡二十四个农业社，经过社员讨论，一般都把劳动力分成四个专业组，其中担任春耕播种的占25％，车水的占20％，积肥、送肥的占5％，其余全部投入修建水利灌溉网和改良土壤工作。农民们白天修水利，晚上开荒、车水，专业组一个顶两个。这样，各项生产就有秩序地均衡进行。同时，各农业社还采取分工到户，专责到人的办法来保证农活的质量。陕西：大荔春耕六十天干完任务近一半
    新华社西安9日电　大荔县农民正在掀起一个大闹春季生产六十天的运动。到处出现一片跃进景象。县城东边大团结农业社的水库区，入夜还是人山人海，提灯笼点火把地干活。汉村乡铁链五社要在六十天中，每队挖好一个百车积肥池，每户挖好一个五车积肥坑。这六十天的任务，现在已经干完将近一半。处于铁链山上的段家乡农民，决心扩大水田两万五千亩，把铁链山变成水晶宫，目前他们已经从山下到山上打了九层连环井。
    大荔县的中共县委书记和县长们已经下田间办公，分片包干，带动群众一块搞生产。县委提出，六十天后，不但要评出先进地区和先进人物，而且要评选出先进的领导者。
    湖南：洞庭湖滨耕牛奔驰  套犁深耕流水作业
    新华社长沙9日电　季节催人，洞庭湖滨农民已提早一个多月开始春耕。
    现在，每天有八万多头耕牛在田野奔驰翻耕。今年这里出现了一种“套犁”的新办法：前后两张犁，一犁套一犁地耕过去，在原来基础上深耕一倍。还出现了“流水作业法”：一簇人在车水，一簇人在送肥下田；当姑娘们把肥料均匀地撒开后，犁坯就把肥料压下去；紧接着就是耙平。大家你追我赶，吆喝呼呼地竞赛。现在绝大部分秧田都下过基肥，整平，只等着春分浸种。三百多万亩冬闲田也都经过了两三道犁耙，再有一道就可以插秧了。
    湖滨的积肥运动高潮已经发展到向湖底进军。每天，约有五万多只木船从湖底捞上一百五十多万担黑草肥料。汉寿县农民车干了有五万多亩大的三百六十多处湖?，把黑色的湖泥一担担地挑到田里。常德、汉寿、桃源等县农民都以每天每亩增加二十担肥料的速度跃进。接着就是运肥下田。常德县的岩咀社有四百多亩远田年年缺肥减产；今年他们新开了一条一千七百多公尺长能行船的大渠道，渠道两旁修起板车道，水陆三路进军，日夜运肥下田，要叫低产田打出千斤粮。
    安徽：“没有大网捕不到大鱼”  投资献料形成了热潮
    新华社合肥9日电　安徽各地农业社社员为了搞好春耕生产，提出“没有大网捕不到大鱼”，纷纷掀起了投资献料的热潮。仅据阜阳、蚌埠、六安等地区的初步统计，社员们投入春耕生产的资金即有九百七十七万多元。阜阳、蚌埠两专区的农民还献出大树和木料六十三万八千根、砖和土坯一千四百七十万块、铁二十一万斤、麻十三万九千斤、草四百五十万斤，作为向社投资。
    社员的投资献料，已使许多农业社春耕生产中的困难问题迎刃而解。太和县今春计划改种水稻三十一万亩，但是缺乏水牛；发动社员投资后，全县农业社员已经投资五十七万元，可买水牛一千五百头。阜南县联二农业社缺少水车六十二部，社里一次拿不出这么多的钱来赶制。可是，社员们献出了可制水车一百二十部的大树八十二棵，就完全克服了这个困难。（附图片）
