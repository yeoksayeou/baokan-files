Resolution of the People of All Circles in the Chinese Capital Supporting the Algerian People's Struggle for National Independence

    The people of all circles in the Chinese capital, in response to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold a "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" on March 30, solemnly gathered today, together with the people of Asian and African countries, to express their firm support for the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence, and to extend warm brotherly greetings to the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for independence and freedom!
    We, the Chinese people, express our utmost indignation at the inhumane colonial war and bloody massacres carried out by the French colonialists in Algeria. We condemn the French colonialists for recently increasing their troops to prepare for a larger-scale suppression of the Algerian people, and for openly creating so-called "no-man's-lands" on the Algerian-Tunisian border. We believe that the war of aggression waged by the French colonialists in Algeria is not only aimed at perpetually conquering and enslaving the Algerian people, but is also a serious provocation and threat to the independence and freedom of the people of Asian and African countries and to international peace and security. We demand that the French government unhesitatingly recognize the independence and national sovereignty of the Algerian people, and end its criminal war and colonial rule! We demand the immediate release of the five Algerian national movement leaders, the immediate release of Djamila Bouhired, and other innocent Algerian patriots in prisons and concentration camps!
    At the same time, we also note that U.S. imperialism has consistently supplied the French imperialists with large quantities of arms and loans, condoning and supporting their colonial war of massacring the Algerian people. Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified its interference in North Africa under the pretext of "mediation," and has increasingly blatantly attempted to replace France's colonial position in Algeria and North Africa in order to rule and enslave the people there. The Chinese people resolutely oppose and condemn this aggressive conspiracy and crime of U.S. imperialism!
    We reiterate that the Chinese people have always sympathized with and fully supported the just cause of the Algerian people and the African people in striving for and safeguarding national independence. We wish the heroic struggle of the Algerian and African people greater victories. We firmly believe that in today's unprecedented unity of the Asian and African people, and in today's world where the forces of peace overwhelm the forces of war, all military offensives and aggressive conspiracies of colonialism and imperialism will surely meet with the most disastrous and most shameful defeat! The Chinese people will always stand with the Algerian people, strengthen unity and cooperation with the people of Asian and African countries and the peace-loving people of the world, and fight to the end for carrying forward the "Bandung Spirit" and realizing the resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, for completely eliminating the scourge of colonialism, and for striving for lasting world peace!
                        March 30, 1958, in Beijing

    中国首都各界人民支援阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会决议
    中国首都各界人民为响应亚非人民团结理事会关于3月30日举行“声援阿尔及利亚日”的号召，今天隆重举行集会，和亚非各国人民一起，表示坚决支援阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义斗争，并且向为独立自由而英勇战斗的阿尔及利亚人民致以热烈的兄弟的敬礼！
    我们中国人民对于法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚进行的惨无人道的殖民战争和血腥屠杀，表示极大的愤慨。我们谴责法国殖民者最近增调军队准备更大规模地镇压阿尔及利亚人民，并且公然在阿尔及利亚和突尼斯边境制造所谓“无人区”。我们认为，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚进行的侵略战争，不仅要永远征服和奴役阿尔及利亚人民，而且也是对亚非各国人民的独立自由和对国际和平与安全的严重挑衅和威胁。我们要求法国政府毫不迟疑地承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和民族主权，结束罪恶的战争和殖民统治！我们要求立即释放阿尔及利亚五位民族运动领袖，立即释放加米拉·布伊海德和在监狱、集中营里的其他无辜的阿尔及利亚爱国者！
    同时，我们也注意到，美国帝国主义一贯以大量军火和贷款供给法帝国主义，纵容和支持其屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的殖民战争。最近，美帝国主义又借口“斡旋”加紧干涉北非，并且愈来愈露骨地企图取代法国在阿尔及利亚和北非的殖民地位，以便统治和奴役那里的人民。中国人民坚决反对和谴责美帝国主义这种侵略阴谋和罪行！
    我们再一次声明：中国人民一贯同情和完全支持阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的正义事业。我们祝阿尔及利亚和非洲人民的英勇斗争取得更伟大的胜利。我们坚决相信：在亚非人民空前团结的今天，在世界和平力量压倒战争势力的今天，殖民主义和帝国主义的一切军事进攻和侵略阴谋，都一定要遭到最惨重和最可耻的失败！中国人民将永远和阿尔及利亚人民站在一起，和亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民加强团结合作，为发扬“万隆精神”和实现亚非人民团结大会的决议，为彻底消除殖民主义祸害和争取世界持久和平而奋斗到底！
