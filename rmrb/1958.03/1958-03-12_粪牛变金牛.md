    Dung Cattle Turn into Golden Cattle
    In many places on Hainan Island, yellow cattle are called "dung cattle" because raising these cattle is only for the purpose of collecting their dung. But now "dung cattle" have become "golden cattle." In 1957, the Hongguang, Hongming, Honghua, and Dongchang state-owned farms extracted 40,159 kilograms of fresh milk from 219 head of yellow cattle, averaging nearly 200 kilograms per head. This is not even the highest milk production during the lactation period of each cow. According to estimates by relevant departments, if the more than 2,000 adult yellow cows on Hainan Island's state-owned farms are crossbred with Dutch cattle, 1,000 hybrid cows that produce milk can be bred in three or four years. In this way, the farm's livestock income can be greatly increased.

    粪牛变金牛
    在海南岛的许多地方，把黄牛叫做“粪牛”，原因是饲养这些牛，只是为了取它们的粪。可是现在“粪牛”已经成了“金牛”了。1957年红光、红明、红华、东昌四个国营农场，从二百一十九头黄牛身上榨得鲜乳四万零一百五十九公斤，平均每头榨乳近二百公斤，这还不是每头母牛泌乳期的最高产乳量。据有关部门估计，要是把海南岛国营农场的二千多头成年黄母牛用荷兰牛杂交，三四年后就可繁殖一千头产乳的杂交牛。这样，农场的畜牧业收入可以大大增加。
