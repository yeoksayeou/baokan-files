    Self-Comfort
    Eisenhower recently boasted to the US Congress about the results of implementing the "Eisenhower Doctrine." He specifically mentioned that this "Doctrine" was very "inspiring" for the countries of the Baghdad Pact.
    But, exactly how "inspiring" was it? Eisenhower was vague. In fact, everyone knows the truth. For example, truly inspiring events recently occurred in Iraq. Patriotic people throughout Iraq, disregarding the government's suppression, held large-scale demonstrations. Their main slogans were: "Down with the Baghdad Pact!" "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine!" For example, in Iran, a large-scale subversive plot planned by the United States was exposed, and this "masterpiece" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" failed in Iran. Eisenhower's boasting about the already stinking "Eisenhower Doctrine" is more for self-comfort than to deceive others.

    自我安慰
    艾森豪威尔最近向美国国会大肆吹嘘“艾森豪威尔主义”的执行结果。他特别提到，这个“主义”对于巴格达条约集团国家是非常“振奋人心”的。
    但是，究竟怎样“振奋人心”呢？艾森豪威尔语焉不详。其实，这倒是大家都知道的。例如，伊拉克最近就发生了真正振奋人心的事件。伊拉克全国各地的爱国人民，不顾政府当局的镇压，举行了大规模的示威游行。他们高呼的主要口号就是：“打倒巴格达条约！”“打倒艾森豪威尔主义！”又例如，在伊朗，美国所筹划的大规模颠覆阴谋被揭穿了，“艾森豪威尔主义”在伊朗的这个“杰作”失败了。艾森豪威尔要为已经发臭的“艾森豪威尔主义”吹嘘，与其说是为了欺人，倒不如说是为了自我安慰而已。
