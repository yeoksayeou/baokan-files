    The Trend of Economic Recession in Japan
    Japan　Kimura Yoshiharu
    I.
    In the period after 1955, the Japanese economy experienced a period of prosperity rarely seen in the capitalist world. However, since the beginning of 1957, a large deficit has occurred in the balance of international payments. To curb this deficit, the Japanese government adopted a tight monetary policy in May 1957. Since then, the economic situation in Japan has deteriorated, showing a trend of recession.
    The "Economic Monthly Report" published by the Economic Planning Agency (December 27, 1957) shows the changes in the Japanese economy through the various indicators listed in the following table:

                 Peak Period    (A)   Recent    (B)  B／A％
                (1957)         (1957)Machine Orders (Private Demand, 100 million yen)   March      　697 　 October　     200　   29Wholesale Prices (June 1950 = 100) 4月       175     December       161     92
                (First Week)         (Second Week)Imports (Million USD)       5月      　453　  November　      266　  59Fixed Workers (Manufacturing, 1956 = 100)6月　  127　  October　      125  　98Mining and Manufacturing Production
  (1934—1936 = 100)7月　  263　  October　      248  　94

    The "Economic Monthly Report" also made the following explanation of the above table:
    "Within half a year after the implementation of the tight monetary policy, the economic situation has undergone great changes. Of course, the changes in the economic situation are somewhat different in different economic sectors, including seasonal changes, so it is difficult to clearly point out which month is the turning point. Some indicators had already passed their peak and were on a downward trend before the implementation of the tight monetary policy, while others continued to rise for a period of time after the implementation of the tight monetary policy. From the economic indicators, machine orders peaked in March, wholesale prices in April, imports in May, the number of employed workers in June, and production in July, and then began to decline."
    The Economic Planning Agency is a government agency, and from its official report, it is undeniable that the Japanese economy has shifted from prosperity to recession.
    II.
    The problem is not only that the economic situation has shifted from prosperity to recession, but also that this recession has begun to become a spontaneous trend from the end of 1957 to the beginning of 1958. Therefore, the Bank of Japan's judgment is: "No matter how tight the money is, at least in the first half of 1958, this spontaneous trend of deflation will continue." The Bank of Japan judges the recent economic trend as "symptoms of spontaneous deflation" because it believes that the recent shrinking of economic activity is not the result of "the mandatory effect of tightening money," but the result of "the natural decline of domestic and foreign demand." The reasons are as follows:
    1.  During the fiscal overspending period in the fourth quarter of 1957, the economic situation continued to decline, and the market conditions of various industries were declining. For example, the year-end market quotations for many commodities such as textiles, steel, non-ferrous metals, ammonium sulfate, soda, chemical fibers, paper, and rayon raw materials have all fallen to the lowest point in 1957, especially textiles and non-ferrous metals have even fallen below the lowest market quotations during the recession in 1953. This comprehensive sluggish market situation is the result of the decline in domestic and foreign demand and the accumulation of goods, and this sluggish market situation has led to a decline in demand between related industrial sectors, thus forming a vicious circle.
    2.  Therefore, it is bound to cause production adjustments. For example, in addition to large-scale production cuts in cotton yarn and cloth, steel, non-ferrous metals, chemical fibers, and pulp have also had to make serious production adjustments. And this production adjustment will lead to a reduction in the demand of related departments. For example, the production adjustment of automobiles will inevitably lead to the shrinking of production in the machinery manufacturing sector, and the shrinking of production in the machinery manufacturing sector will lead to a reduction in the demand for steel, and so on.
    3.  Equipment investment has been cut back on the basis of construction, but if production cuts continue in the future, equipment will become surplus. Due to high costs and reduced corporate profits, investment willingness will also decline, which will affect the reduction of domestic and foreign demand.
    4.  General consumer demand also shows the same trend. According to a survey by the Bank of Japan, since around October 1957, the rate of increase in sales of consumer goods over the previous year has stagnated. The situation in the retail market around the end of the year, except for the better sales of food, the sales of intermediate-grade products have shown a "recession." In the future, due to consumers waiting for prices to fall and buying less or delaying purchases, and due to production adjustments and layoffs, the demand for consumer goods will also stagnate.
    5.  From the above points, the recent economic situation is different from the situation during the August crisis in 1957. During the August crisis, emergency measures were taken to tighten finances in order to curb the foreign exchange crisis, which made the phenomenon of tight money surface at once, thus creating a situation in which, although there was demand and orders, there was insufficient capital and difficulty in turnover, and even a phenomenon of "bankruptcy due to surplus" occurred. The current situation is, of course, affected by tight money, but the main reason is the reduction in demand itself, and the deflation phenomenon is proceeding spontaneously. The deterioration of payment conditions and the decrease in the cash recovery rate were significant phenomena during the August crisis, but now the orders themselves are decreasing. From the recent reasons for the bankruptcy of factories and shops, there are not many bankruptcies due to "failure to recover outstanding debts," but bankruptcies due to "failure to sell goods" are increasing. Based on the above points, the Bank of Japan and general commercial banks believe that although the scale of fiscal revenue exceeding fiscal expenditure in the first quarter of this year (the fourth quarter of the 1957 fiscal year) may not be as large as in the same period of the previous year, and the financial market will not be as tight as in the previous year, the manufacturing and sales sectors of textiles, non-ferrous metals, and some durable consumer goods will still experience bankruptcies due to unsalable goods. This kind of bankruptcy will be a clear "loss-making bankruptcy."
    III.
    From the above characteristics, it can be seen that the current economic downturn in Japan is a downturn caused by oversupply (as for the chemical fiber sector, it has had to implement a 50% production cut from January to March 1958, which is more of an overproduction crisis than a recession).
    Regarding the nature of this recession, the Economic Planning Agency's same "Economic Monthly Report" made the following explanation:
    "This economic recession is generally considered to be caused by the tight monetary policy adopted to cope with the deterioration of the balance of international payments, but industries such as the textile industry and the steel industry have already experienced supply and demand imbalances and sluggish sales due to overproduction and over-importation before the implementation of tight measures; there are also some sectors where the previous equipment investment has gradually become productive, resulting in oversupply. In addition, at present, enterprises do not want to increase their inventory of raw materials, so although the final demand may not have decreased, the intermediate demand has decreased, resulting in overproduction. In this sense, the problem caused by the tight monetary policy has shifted from the initial simple shortage of funds and tight money to the problem of oversupply. In other words, if it was a case of being able to sell goods but not being able to collect money before August 1957, then recently it is a case of not being able to sell goods and not having enough money."
    As mentioned above, the Japanese economy is facing a period in which it must find a way to overcome the recession caused by oversupply and overproduction.
    The means to overcome the recession caused by overproduction and oversupply are, first, to increase exports, and second, to increase domestic consumption needs.
    Regarding the issue of increasing exports, the Kishi Cabinet has set a goal that the exports in the 1958 fiscal year should increase by 320 million US dollars compared with the previous fiscal year, reaching 3.15 billion US dollars. However, it is impossible to achieve this goal without changing Japan's trade structure. Because Japan's trade is highly dependent on capitalist countries, especially the United States, which are constantly affected by economic fluctuations, and the economies of capitalist countries centered on the United States have also shown obvious signs of decline. In order to overcome the recession in Japan in 1958, in order to enable the Japanese economy to develop forward on a stable and balanced basis without being affected by the economic fluctuations of other capitalist countries, it is necessary to greatly expand the proportion of trade with China and the Soviet Union, because China and the Soviet Union are steadily advancing on the basis of a planned economy and have no economic fluctuations.
    Secondly, regarding the issue of increasing domestic consumption needs, the Kishi Cabinet has also adopted policies that go against the tide. The draft budget for the 1958 fiscal year (passed by the House of Representatives on March 3, 1958), which was the first drafted by the Kishi Cabinet since its formation, took the goal of improving the balance of international payments and adopted the policy of "strictly suppressing domestic demand." This policy can only intensify the overproduction crisis and produce greater contradictions. Considering that the Diet is bound to be dissolved and elections for the House of Representatives will be held this year, in order to benefit the civil engineering and construction industry and large monopoly enterprises, the budget for road construction and financial investment loans has been greatly increased. This financial measure, which is beneficial to large monopoly enterprises and large capitalists, will also deepen the overproduction crisis.
    The Japanese economy, due to the recession caused by overproduction, has now reached a point where it is necessary to make great reforms to the state of dependence on the United States and the state of rule by large monopoly capital. From the standpoint of promoting national welfare, this change is even more necessary. And the implementation of this change must be coordinated with diplomatic and political changes. This is the current situation of the Japanese economy.

    日本经济衰退的趋势
    日本　木村禧八郎
    一
    在1955年以后的一段期间里，日本经济情况曾出现资本主义世界少见的繁荣局面。但自1957年年初以来，国际收支却发生了大量逆差。为制止这种逆差，日本政府在1957年5月采取了金融紧缩政策。从此以后，日本的经济情况便每况愈下，发生了衰退的趋势。
    经济企划厅刊行的“经济月报”（1957年12月27日），通过下表所列的各种指标，表明了日本经济情况的变化：
                 最高时期    （A）   最　近    （B）  B／A％
                （1957年）         （1957年）机　械　订　货（民需，亿日元）   3月      　697 　 10月　     200　   29批　发　物　价（1950年6月＝100） 4月       175     12月       161     92
                （第一周）         （第二周）输　　　　入（百万美元）       5月      　453　  11月　      266　  59固　定　工　人（制造业，1956年＝100）6月　  127　  10月　      125  　98工　矿　业　生　产
  （1934—1936年＝100）7月　  263　  10月　      248  　94
    “经济月报”并对上表作了如下的说明：
    “紧缩政策实行后，半年之内，经济情况已发生很大变化。当然，经济情况的变动，在不同的经济部门，表现也多少有些不同，其中也包括季节性的变动在内，因此很难明确指出转折点是在哪一月。某些指标在实行紧缩政策以前既已越过最高峰而走向下坡路，另一些指标在实行紧缩政策以后还有一段时期继续上升。从经济指标看，机械订货在3月，批发物价在4月，输入在5月，雇用工人数目在6月，生产在7月各自先后达到最高峰，而后即开始下降。”
    经济企划厅是政府机关，从它所公布的官方报告看，日本经济已从繁荣转向衰退，已经是无可置疑的了。
    二
    问题不仅在于经济情况已从繁荣转向衰退，而且在于这种衰退从1957年末到1958年初已开始成为一种自发趋势。因此，日本银行的判断是：“不管金融如何吃紧，至少1958年上半年这种通货紧缩的自发趋势将会继续下去”。日本银行把最近的经济动向判断为“自发的通货紧缩症状”，是因为它认为最近经济活动的缩小，不是由于“抽紧银根的强制作用”的结果，而是由于“内外需求本身的减退自然而然造成”的结果。其理由有如下五点：
    一、在1957年第四季度财政超支期间，经济情况继续下降，各行业的市场情况都在走下坡路。例如纤维、钢铁、有色金属、硫安、苏打、化学纤维、制纸、人造丝原料等很多商品的年关行情都跌落到1957年的最低点，尤其是纤维、有色金属等甚至还跌落到1953年不景气时期的最低行情以下。这种全面的市场不旺情况，是内外需求减退和货物积压的结果，而这种市场不旺情况又引起有关产业部门相互间需求的减退，于是就形成了一种恶性循环。
    二、因此，势必引起生产的调整。例如，除了棉纱、布匹已进行大量减产以外，钢铁、有色金属、化学纤维、纸浆等也不得不进行认真的生产调整。而这种生产调整又会引起有关部门的需求的减少。例如，汽车的生产调整，必将引起机械制造部门的生产缩小，而机械制造部门的生产缩小又会引起钢铁需求的减少等等。
    三、设备投资已在开工的基础上加以削减，但今后减产如果继续进行，设备则将形成过剩，由于成本高，企业利润降低，投资意愿也会减退，而这又会影响内外需求的减少。
    四、一般消费需求也呈现出同样趋势。据日本银行调查，自1957年10月左右，消费品销售额的对上一年的上升率即停顿下来，年末前后零售市场的情况，除食品的销售情况较好以外，中级品的销售情况已呈现“不景气”。今后，由于消费者等待物价下落而少买或缓买，由于进行生产调整解雇工人等等，对于消费品的需求也将出现停滞状态。
    五、从上述各点看来，最近的经济情况和1957年8月危机时的情况是不同的。8月危机时，由于为制止外汇危机采取了紧缩金融的紧急措施，使得银根吃紧现象一举而表面化，因而造成了这样一种情况：虽有需求和订货，但资金不足，难于周转，甚至产生了“盈余倒闭”现象。现在的情况，固然也有银根紧的影响，但更主要的是由于需求本身的减少，通货紧缩现象在自发地进行。8月危机时，支付条件的恶化，现金回收率的降低等等是显著的现象，但现在是订货本身在减少，从最近工厂、商店的倒闭的原因看，由于“收不回外欠货款”而倒闭的已经不多，而由于“货卖不出去”而倒闭的却日益增多。基于上述各点，日本银行以及一般商业银行认为：今年第一季度（1957年会计年度的第四季度），财政收入超过财政支出的规模虽然未必像上一年度同一时期那样大，从而金融市场也不会像上一年度那样紧迫，但纤维，有色金属，一部分耐用消费品等制造、贩卖部门仍然会出现由于货无销路而产生的倒闭现象。这种倒闭现象，将是明显的“亏损倒闭”。
    三
    从上述各种特点看来，可以知道，现在日本经济的不景气，乃是由于供给过剩而产生的不景气（至于在化学纤维等部门，已不得不从1958年1月到3月实行50％的减产措施，与其说处于不景气状态，不如说已面临生产过剩危机）。
    关于这种不景气的性质，经济企划厅的同一期“经济月报”作了如下的说明：
    “这次的景气衰退，一般认为是由于为应付国际收支恶化而采取金融紧缩政策所引起的，但像纤维工业、钢铁工业等，在采取紧缩措施以前，就由于生产过剩、输入过剩已经产生了供求失调、销路不畅的现象；还有一些部门，由于以前的设备投资已逐渐变成生产力，因而产生了供给过剩现象。此外，目前各企业都不想增加库存原材料，因而最终需求虽然未必已经减少，但中间需求却形减少，所以产生了生产过剩现象。在这种意义上，由紧缩政策所产生的问题，已从最初单纯的资金不足、银根吃紧转到供给过剩问题上面来了。换句话说，如果说1957年8月以前，货卖得出去而钱收不回来，那末最近却是货卖不出去，钱也不足。”
    如上所述，日本经济已经面临一个必须设法打开由于供给过剩、生产过剩而引起的不景气局面的时期了。
    打开由于生产过剩、供给过剩所造成的不景气局面的手段，首先是增加输出，其次是增加国内的消费需要。
    关于增加输出问题，岸内阁确定的目标是，1958年度的输出，应比上一年度增加三亿二千万美元，即达到三十一亿五千万美元。但是不改变日本的贸易结构，想要达到这一目标是不可能的。因为日本的贸易对于不断受到景气变动影响的资本主义各国，特别是对于美国的依存程度很大，而且以美国为中心的资本主义国家的经济也已经显出明显的衰落现象。为了打开1958年度日本的不景气局面，为了使日本经济不受其它资本主义国家的景气变动的影响，能在稳定均衡的基础上向前发展，就必须大大扩大同中国和苏联的贸易比重，因为中国和苏联都是在计划经济基础上稳步前进，而且是没有景气变动的。
    其次，关于增加国内消费需要问题，岸内阁也采取了倒行逆施的政策。岸内阁组成以来第一次编制的1958年度预算草案（已于1958年3月3日由众议院通过），以改善国际收支为目标，采取了“严格抑制国内需求”的方针。这种政策，只能使生产过剩危机更形加剧，产生更大的矛盾。由于考虑到今年内势必解散国会，进行众议院的选举，为使土木建筑业和大垄断企业有利可图，有关道路修筑的预算以及财政投资贷款等均有大量增加，这种有利于大垄断企业和大资本家的财政措施，也将加深生产过剩危机。
    日本经济，由于生产过剩所引起的不景气局面，现在已经到了这样一个关头，对于依存美国的状态，对于大垄断资本统治的状态，已经是必须大加一番改革的时候了。从增进国民福利的立场来看，这种改变就更有必要。而实行这种改变，又必须有外交、政治上的转变与之配合。这就是日本经济的现状。
