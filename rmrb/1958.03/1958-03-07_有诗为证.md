    A Poem as Evidence
    We launch a satellite into the sky,
    It orbits the Earth, yet its whereabouts are a mystery.
    Its radio signals are clear and loud,
    But it vanishes into the atmosphere, its fate unknown.
    This satirical poem appeared on the bulletin board of the U.S. Naval Electronics Laboratory observation station on the morning of the 6th.

    有诗为证
    我们发射一个卫星去天上，
    它绕地球旋转却不知在何方。
    它的无线电讯号清晰又响亮，
    可就是在大气层里消失得不知去向。
    这首讽刺诗出现在6日早晨美国海军电子实验室观测站的公告栏上。
