    Renmin University Philosophy Department Prepares to Form "Mao Zedong Philosophical Works Research Association"
    Under the promotion of big-character posters, the Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China has decided to prepare for the establishment of the "Mao Zedong Philosophical Works Research Association" (tentative name) to promote and assist teachers in deeply studying the philosophical issues in Comrade Mao Zedong's works.
    This organization is not only urgently needed to promote a great leap forward in the teaching and research work of the Philosophy Department, but it will also play a good role in further implementing the principle of combining theory with the revolutionary practice of our country.
    They are now actively drafting the specific regulations of the research association. After the research association is formally established, they will also invite people from outside the school to exchange research experiences and insights.

    人大哲学系筹组“毛泽东哲学著作研究会”
    中国人民大学哲学系在大字报的促进下，决定筹组“毛泽东哲学著作研究会”（暂定名），以推动和帮助教师们深入地钻研毛泽东同志著作中的哲学问题。
    这个组织不仅对于促使哲学系教学、研究工作大跃进是迫切需要的，而且对于更进一步地贯彻理论联系我国革命实际的方针，也将会起很好的推进作用。
    现在他们正在积极进行研究会具体章程的拟订工作，研究会正式宣布成立后，还将邀请校外人士前去交流研究经验和心得。
