    Practical Work and Hard Work
    Wan Xiangxin
    In the recent news we received about the development of local industries, two pieces of news from Liangdang County in Gansu and Simao Prefecture in Yunnan shine with particular brilliance. Liangdang County has established twenty-three small factories in less than two months, increasing the county's total industrial output value sevenfold compared to last year. In Simao Prefecture, more than fifty of the two hundred new and expanded factories and mines planned for this year have already started production. Recently, all provinces across the country have proposed to let local industries bloom everywhere, and these two regions are already in full bloom!
    In some areas, after setting plans, no concrete measures have been formulated, and although there are plans to build many factories, not a single one has been started. This is a very noteworthy problem. In the previous stage, the main contradiction in production and construction was the contradiction between advanced thinking and conservative thinking, which, in some respects, was also manifested as a contradiction between leaders and the masses. The emergence of advanced plans has resolved these contradictions to some extent. Now, how to turn plans into reality has become the main contradiction. After all, plans are just pictures on paper. The purpose of making plans is to turn the beautiful scenery into reality. If implementation cannot be guaranteed, what is the value of such plans?
    The solution to this new contradiction is to immediately come up with measures and engage in practical work. As Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "We must not only set tasks but also solve the problem of the methods for accomplishing them. Our task is to cross a river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. If the problem of the bridge or boat is not solved, crossing the river is just empty talk. If the problem of method is not solved, the task is just a lot of nonsense." With measures, on the one hand, we can ensure that we immediately start implementing the plan, and on the other hand, we can further test whether the plan is practical. In fact, because people's understanding always has a certain distance from objective reality, plans cannot be formulated perfectly at once but need to be continuously corrected through practice. Rapidly implementing plans, like Liangdang and Simao, and immediately achieving some results, can not only benefit production and construction in a timely manner but also further encourage the enthusiasm of the masses with facts, and at the same time, accumulate experience and discover problems and shortcomings in planning and work. In this way, the overall plan will naturally be easily implemented smoothly.
    The current task of the promoters is to advocate both practical work and hard work. Now, most parts of the country have seen the snow melt and the ice thaw, which is a great season for construction. May everyone immediately engage in practical work and hard work, so that factories and mines in every county can universally start work, bloom early, and bear fruit early!

    实干　苦干
    万向辛
    在我们最近收到的关于发展地方工业的消息当中，甘肃两当县和云南思茅专区的两条消息闪烁着特别引人的光彩。两当县在不到两个月的时间内已经办起了二十三个小型工厂，使全县工业产值一跃比去年增长了七倍；思茅专区今年计划新建、扩建的二百多个厂矿，有五十多个已经开工生产。最近全国各省都提出要让地方工业遍地开花，这两个地区已是鲜花盛开了！
    现在有些地区，在订了规划以后，却没有拟出具体的措施，计划要建多少多少工厂，连一个也没有动手。这是一个十分值得注意的问题。在前一个阶段，生产建设中的主要矛盾是先进思想和保守思想的矛盾，在某些方面，也表现为领导和群众之间的矛盾。先进规划的出现，使这些矛盾得到了一定程度的解决。现在如何使规划成为现实，又变成了主要矛盾。因为规划终究是纸面上的图景。定规划的目的是为了把美景变为现实。如果不能保证实现，那种规划又有什么价值呢？
    解决这个新的矛盾的办法，就是立即拿出措施来，实实在在地干起来。正如毛泽东同志告诉我们的：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”有了措施，一方面可以保证立即着手实现规划，另一方面也可以进一步检验规划是否切合实际。事实上，由于人们的认识同客观实际总会有一定的距离，规划就不可能事先一下子制定得尽善尽美，而是需要通过实践来不断地校正。迅速实施规划，像两当、思茅那样马上干出一些成绩来，既可以使生产建设及时受益，又可以用事实进一步鼓舞群众的积极性，同时可以积累经验，发现规划和工作中的问题和缺点。这样，全面的规划自然就容易顺利实现了。
    促进派目前的任务，就是既要提倡实干，又要提倡苦干。现在，全国绝大部分地区已经雪融冰消，正是施工的大好季节。愿大家立即实干，苦干，让县县厂矿普遍开工，早日开出鲜花，早日结出硕果！
