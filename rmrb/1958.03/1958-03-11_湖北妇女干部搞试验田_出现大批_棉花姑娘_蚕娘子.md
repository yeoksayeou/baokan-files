    Hubei Women Cadres Engage in Experimental Fields
    Giving Rise to a Large Number of "Cotton Maidens" and "Silkworm Women"
    (Our Dispatch) The majority of women cadres and "Five-Good" activists in prefectures, counties, districts, townships, and communes in Hubei Province are taking the lead in cultivating experimental fields. Incomplete statistics from the Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou prefectures alone show that more than 22,600 women are cultivating more than 22,000 mu of experimental fields. In Hong'an and Macheng counties, 100% of women cadres from the township women's federations down to the production teams are cultivating experimental fields.
    Because women possess characteristics such as "carefulness, focus, and ambition," their experimental fields have achieved outstanding results, and many high-yield models have emerged. For example, the Zhou Tingying cotton production experimental group of the Shouyi Cooperative in Liangshui Township, Suixian County, achieved a yield of 1,430 jin of seed cotton per mu; the Lei Yuzhen rice experimental group of the Central Cooperative in Baidun Township, Xianning, achieved a yield of 1,196 jin of rice per mu; and the peanut experimental field of Wu Suzhen, director of the Women's Federation in Chitai Township, Hong'an, achieved a yield of 2,100 jin per mu. Lin Shuying of the Chongguang First Cooperative in Luotian obtained 121 jin and six liang of silkworm cocoons per sheet of silkworm eggs, more than double the national average yield, and was known as "Silkworm Woman."
    Liu Fenglan, the deputy director of the Qunle Cooperative in Gaofeng Township, Hong'an County, is a twenty-year-old girl. When she first started cultivating experimental fields, she encountered many obstacles from conservatives in the cooperative, but she was determined to learn the techniques, and the yield of her five-fen experimental field reached 1,180 jin, earning her the name "Rice Maiden."
    Many women throughout the province, by cultivating experimental fields, have gradually learned to master production seasons and general production techniques, and are able to teach and explain, moving from being able to do only one type of work or only general work. Many honorary titles such as "Cotton Maiden," "Sesame Maiden," "Peanut Maiden," and "Silkworm Woman" have emerged in various places. In the Xiangyang Prefecture alone, there are 7,802 "Cotton Maidens." (Zhang Wei)

    湖北妇女干部搞试验田
    出现大批“棉花姑娘”“蚕娘子”
    本报讯　湖北大部分专、县、区、乡、社、队的妇女干部和妇女“五好”积极分子，都带头搞试验田。仅据黄冈、孝感、荆州三个专区不完全的统计，就有二万二千六百多妇女搞试验田二万二千多亩。红安、麻城两县自乡妇联以下到生产队的妇女干部，百分之百的搞了试验田。
    由于妇女们具有“细心、专心、进取心”等特点，她们搞的试验田获得了出色的成绩，出现了很多高额丰产典型。例如，随县两水乡首义社周廷英棉产试验小组，亩产籽棉一千四百三十斤；咸宁柏墩乡中心社雷玉珍水稻试验小组亩产一千一百九十六斤；红安翅台乡妇女主任吴素珍的花生试验田亩产二千一百斤。罗田重光一社林淑英每张蚕子纸，获蚕茧一百二十一斤六两，超过全国平均产量的一倍以上，被人称为“蚕娘子”。
    红安县高峰乡群乐社副主任刘凤兰，是个二十岁的姑娘。她最初搞试验田时，曾遭到社里有保守思想人的重重阻难，但她下决心学会技术，使五分试验田的产量达到一千一百八十斤，被人称为“稻谷姑娘”。
    全省许多妇女都通过搞试验田，由过去只能做一种活或只能做一般的活，逐渐学会了掌握生产季节和一般生产技术操作，并且能讲能教。各地出现了许多“棉花姑娘”、“芝麻姑娘”、“花生姑娘”、“蚕娘子”等光荣称号，仅襄阳专区就有七千八百零二个“棉花姑娘”。（张碨）
