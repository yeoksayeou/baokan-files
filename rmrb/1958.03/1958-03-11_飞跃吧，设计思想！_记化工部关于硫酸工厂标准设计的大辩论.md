Two months ago, during the climax of the rectification campaign in the Ministry of Chemical Industry, a striking big-character poster suddenly appeared at the entrance of Minister Peng Tao's office. After the launch of the anti-waste campaign, on January 21, another big-character poster with similar content was posted on the staircase at the entrance of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. These two big-character posters, like two flames, quickly spread and ignited many departments of the Ministry of Chemical Industry.

What issues did these two big-character posters raise? They asked: Why is the investment in the standard design of sulfuric acid plants so high? The big-character posters made a clear comparison: several newly designed sulfuric acid plants with the same production capacity have vastly different investments. The Dalian Chemical Plant was designed for 5.7 million yuan, the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant for 5.9 million yuan, while the standard design by the Basic Chemical Design Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry reached as high as 8.2 million yuan. The authors of the big-character posters asked: Can the investment be reduced in accordance with the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift?

This is not merely a matter of 2.2 million yuan. This is a standard design, and dozens of sulfuric acid plants will be built according to its blueprint in the future. Therefore, this is a major issue involving dozens of 2.2 million yuan, the speed of development of China's urgently needed chemical fertilizer industry (sulfuric acid is the largest raw material used in chemical fertilizers), and how to specifically implement the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

It is undisputed that the design can be modified and the investment can be reduced. The question is whether to reduce it significantly or slightly, whether to make major or minor changes, whether to only change some minor details, or whether to fundamentally alter the design. This is not a simple issue. In order to find the correct answer, the leadership of the Ministry of Chemical Industry specially convened a debate. In addition to the Basic Chemical Design Institute, which was responsible for the design, and relevant personnel from the Ministry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry also invited technical personnel from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and sulfuric acid plants under its jurisdiction, as well as representatives from the State Technology Commission and other relevant commissions, including specialists in research, design, construction, and production, to participate in the debate and work together to eliminate waste in the design.

The debate was held eight times in total. This debate was a major technical and economic debate, as well as a vivid ideological and political debate. At the meeting, the lines were clearly drawn, and sharp exchanges took place for several rounds. Off-site activities were also intense. People searched for arguments, proposed plans, and calculated detailed accounts. Some people worked day and night, and some didn't even rest on Sundays. After this fierce debate, the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results were further deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Judging from the materials presented at the debate, the problem was clear: the designers neglected China's national conditions and the principles of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in construction. In their design, they mainly considered the following: being beautiful and aesthetically pleasing! Being convenient and labor-saving to produce! Being "safe and reliable"! Therefore, the factories they designed had three characteristics: high, large, and many. High meant a high degree of mechanization and automation, and a high safety factor. Large meant large factory buildings, large gaps, and a large land area. Many meant many structures and many machines and equipment. The result was spending more money and being generous with the country's resources.

Those who came to eliminate waste mainly started from the fact that China is still a "poor and blank" country and tried to save investment as much as possible while ensuring product quality. They first attacked the idea of pursuing beauty and convenience in design. Someone said: "China's characteristic is that there are many people and little money. Why must bridge cranes be used for transporting raw materials? If manual or semi-mechanized transportation is used instead, not only can the cranes be eliminated, but the raw material warehouse can also be changed from reinforced concrete to brick and wood structure, and more people can be employed." Someone else proposed: The Yongli Nanjing Plant only spent a few thousand yuan on control instruments, while the standard design would cost 170,000 yuan. According to China's current conditions, it is good enough to have automatic indication in production, and there is no need to spend a lot of money on automatic recording. For example, to check the furnace temperature, just insert a thermometer and have the workers check it regularly.

At the debate, the idea of "safe and reliable" in the design became the most prominent target of public criticism. The "safe and reliable" idea was reflected in the design mainly by the excessively large safety factor and the mechanically copying the experience of industrially advanced countries in technology. The debate made sharp criticisms of this idea. For example, regarding the excessive safety factor, someone questioned the excessive height of the chimney: Since there is tail gas recovery, why is there still a big tail? Just add a tube to the tail gas tower. Others proposed: Domestic sulfuric acid plants all use one drying tower, and the drying tower in the standard design is much larger than others, so why use two?

The issue of safety factors was relatively easy to handle and was generally resolved after one or two rounds of exchanges. However, the "safe and reliable" idea in production technology was not so simple. Because production technology is very complex, involves a wide range of issues, and production must be safe and reliable. This debate launched a fierce debate against this idea. The focus of the debate was concentrated on a fundamental issue in the sulfuric acid production process. In the sulfuric acid production process, there is a purification section, the purpose of which is to wash away the mineral dust and acid mist contained in the furnace gas. What method should be used for washing? This was the center of the dispute. England was the first country to produce sulfuric acid. Since England began producing sulfuric acid in the 17th century, all countries in the world, including England, have used acid washing. Because "acid washing" has high dust removal efficiency, some sulfuric acid plants in China with better equipment also use acid washing. The standard design also uses acid washing. However, the Yongli Nanjing Plant and the joint state-private Shanghai Xinyi Sulfuric Acid Plant use "water washing." Water washing has simpler equipment than acid washing, can reduce the use of many valuable equipment, especially equipment that needs to be imported and is difficult to order, and can also save a lot of metal materials, which can save more than 800,000 yuan in investment. Moreover, the quality of sulfuric acid produced is the same, and the cost is even lower. Therefore, people who dare to break the routine advocate changing acid washing to water washing. However, some designers, because they spend more time in the office and less time in the factory, have more book knowledge and less practical knowledge, and especially lack understanding of the wisdom of the workers and masses, and do not have a deep understanding of the country's principles of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, so in their view, the use of water washing has many shortcomings and difficult problems to solve. For example, they pointed out that the wastewater from water washing is toxic and difficult to treat. However, those who advocate water washing believe, based on actual production experience, that the toxic wastewater can be precipitated in sedimentation tanks and filtered; it can also be discharged in places where drainage is convenient. Designers who maintain acid washing believe that water washing will lose some sulfuric acid, which may not be cost-effective in the long run. Those who advocate water washing believe that this method is cost-effective now and will be cost-effective in the long run. According to their calculations, water washing can only lose 500 tons of acid per year, but it can save more than 800,000 yuan in investment. The investment saved by using water washing in seven sulfuric acid plants can be used to build another sulfuric acid plant, which can produce tens of thousands of tons of acid every year, while the acid lost by the seven sulfuric acid plants every year is only 3,500 tons. In the eyes of some designers who maintain acid washing, there is another major problem that is most difficult to solve. They believe that the Yongli Nanjing Plant's water washing method does not have high enough dust removal efficiency; although the Xinyi water washing method has high dust removal efficiency, the relevant conditions in the standard design are different from those of Xinyi, and the dust removal efficiency may not be high if transplanted. In their view, even if these local factories have some good things, they are nothing more than "heterodoxies" that are not worth learning from. Acid washing is an international standard and is the most safe and reliable. Industrial countries have set very high dust removal indicators for sulfuric acid production. If water washing is used and the dust is not removed cleanly, although it does not affect product quality, it may affect the normal production of the next section. People who advocate changing to water washing believe that the standards adopted should be based on their own national conditions. Just like if you have a lot of money, you can wear a fur coat, but if you have less money, you can wear a cotton coat to keep warm. Even in Britain, which has a 200-year history of industrialization, some factories have also adopted water washing after World War II due to a shortage of lead materials. Someone said: Even if the dust removal efficiency of water washing is a little worse, it is not a big problem. The experience of the Yongli Nanjing Plant proves that even with a little more trouble, it has not affected normal production. Whether the dust removal efficiency is high when using the Xinyi water washing method is still a problem at present, but people who advocate water washing, based on the actual experience of production factories and the wisdom of the workers and masses, have cited many specific methods to prove that as long as some effort is made, it can be completely solved. In addition, if the experiment of foam tower water washing is successful, the dust removal efficiency will also be very high. They said: To resolutely implement the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift, it is necessary to break the conservatism and laziness hidden behind safety and reliability, to boldly reform technology, and to declare war on difficulties. Only by resolutely implementing the principle of building the country through diligence and thrift can we achieve national industrialization at high speed.

The comrades in the design institute have calculated the accounts. As a result of modifying the design plan based on the opinions raised at the debate, the investment in the standard design of sulfuric acid plants has dropped from 8.2 million yuan to 5 million yuan. That is to say, the money that was originally used to build two factories can now be used to build three factories and still have some left over. If the investment originally planned to be used to build sulfuric acid plants during the Second Five-Year Plan remains unchanged, then the original plan to build more than 20 factories can now be increased to 40-50 factories, which can produce much more sulfuric acid. In addition, it can save a lot of metal materials, and because there is no need to order goods from abroad, the construction time can also be accelerated. Look, what a big "watermelon" this is!

    飞跃吧，设计思想！
    ——记化工部关于硫酸工厂标准设计的大辩论
    新华社记者　田林
    两个月以前，化学工业部整改达到高潮的时候，部长彭涛的办公室门口突然贴上了一张引人注目的大字报。反浪费运动展开以后，1月21日，化工部大门口的楼梯头上又贴上了一张内容大致相同的大字报。这两张大字报像两把火，迅速延烧起来烧到了化工部的许多部门。
    这两张大字报提出了什么问题呢？它们提出：硫酸工厂标准设计的投资为什么这样高？大字报作了一个鲜明的对比：几个新设计的硫酸工厂，生产能力相同，投资却相差很大。大连化工厂设计的是五百七十万元，南京磷肥厂的是五百九十万元，而化工部基本化学设计院作的标准设计却高达八百二十万元。大字报的作者提出：可否根据勤俭建国的方针，把投资降下来？
    这不仅仅是关系二百几十万元的问题。这是标准设计，今后几十个硫酸工厂都要按照它的面貌来建设。所以这是关系几十个二百几十万元的大问题，是关系我国急需的化学肥料工业发展快慢的问题（硫酸是化肥用量最大的原料之一），是关系如何具体贯彻勤俭建国和多快好省方针的大问题。
    设计可以修改，投资可以降低，这一点没有人反对。是大降还是小降，是大改还是小改，是只改些枝枝叶叶，还是可以动一动根本，这就不是简单的问题了。化工部领导方面为了寻找正确的答案，特地召开了一个辩论会。除了担负这项设计的基本化学设计院和本部的有关人员以外，化工部又请了石油工业部、冶金工业部和本部所属硫酸工厂的技术人员，国家技术委员会和其他有关委员会的代表，包括研究、设计、施工、生产等各方面的专门人材来参加辩论，一齐动手来烧掉设计中的浪费。
    辩论会一共开了八次。这次辩论会是一场技术和经济的大辩论，也是一场生动的思想和政治的大辩论。在会上，阵线很分明，唇枪舌剑，一连打了好几个回合。会外活动也很紧张。找论据，提方案，算细账，有的人废寝忘食，有的人星期天也不休息。经过这场激烈的辩论以后，勤俭建国和多快好省的建设方针，更进一步深入人心了。
    从辩论会上提出的材料看来，问题很明显，设计人员忽略了我国的国情，忽略了多快好省的建设方针。他们在设计时主要考虑的是这样几条：漂亮美观呀！生产起来方便省事呀！“稳妥可靠”呀！所以他们设计出来的工厂有三个特点：高，大，多。高是机械化自动化程度高。安全系数高。大是厂房大，空隙大，占地面积大。多是构筑物多，机器设备多。结果是多花钱，慷国家之慨。
    来参加烧掉浪费现象的人们，主要是从目前我国还是一个“又穷又白”的国家出发，在能够保证产品质量的条件下面，尽量考虑节省投资。他们首先向着设计上图漂亮美观和生产方便省事的思想开火。有人说：“我国的特点是人多钱少，为什么原料搬运一定要用桥式吊车呢？如果改为人工或半机械化的运输，既可以省去吊车，原料库又可以不用钢筋混凝土结构而改用砖木结构，还可以多一些人就业。”又有人提出：永利宁厂用在控制仪表上的钱只有几千元，而标准设计就要花十七万元。根据我国目前的条件，生产上有自动指示就不错了，不必再花很多钱去采用自动记录。比如检查炉温，只要插一个温度计，由工人定时看看就行。
    在辩论会上，设计中的“稳妥可靠”思想成了最突出的众矢之的。“稳妥可靠”的思想反映在设计上主要是安全系数过大；在技术上墨守成规，机械地搬用工业先进国家的经验等。辩论会对于这种思想作了尖锐的批评。如关于安全系数太大的问题，有人针对烟囱太高发问道：既然有了尾气回收，为什么还要翘一个大尾巴呢？只要在尾气塔上加个筒子就行了。还有人提出：国内已有的硫酸工厂都是用的一个干燥塔，标准设计的干燥塔比人家的大得多，为什么还要用两个呢？
    对于安全系数的问题还比较好办，一经交锋，打上一两个回合大体上就解决了。但是在生产技术问题上的“稳妥可靠”思想就不那么简单。因为生产技术问题很复杂，牵涉的面很广，而生产又必需稳妥可靠。这次辩论会针对这种思想进行了一场激烈的大论战。论战的焦点，集中在硫酸生产过程中一个带根本性的问题上面。在硫酸生产过程中，有一个净化工段，目的是把炉气中含的矿尘和酸雾洗涤干净。用什么方法来洗？这就是争论的中心。英国是生产硫酸最早的国家，从十七世纪英国开始生产硫酸以来，世界各国包括英国在内，都是用酸洗。因为“酸洗”除尘效率高，我国有些设备较好的硫酸厂也是用的酸洗。标准设计用的同样是酸洗。但是，永利宁厂和公私合营上海新业制酸厂却是用的“水洗”。水洗比酸洗设备简单，可以少用许多贵重设备，特别是需要进口而又不易定货的设备，还可以节省许多金属材料，可以节约投资八十多万元，而且生产出来的硫酸质量一样，成本还低一些。因此，敢于打破常规的人就主张改酸洗为水洗。然而，某些设计人员由于平时坐办公室多，下工厂少，书本知识多，实际知识少，特别是对工人群众的智慧更缺乏了解，对国家多快好省的建设方针体会不深，所以在他们看来，采用水洗有许多缺点和难于解决的困难。如他们提出，采用水洗，废水里面有毒，处理很麻烦。但是，主张水洗的人根据实际生产经验认为，废水有毒可以用沉淀池沉淀，可以过滤；在排水方便的地方还可以放掉。维护酸洗的设计人员认为水洗要损失一部分硫酸，从长远来看未必合算。主张水洗的人则认为，采用这种方法现在合算，从长远看也合算。根据他们的计算，采用水洗每年只能损失五百吨酸，但是却可以节省投资八十多万元。采用水洗，七个硫酸工厂节省的投资就可以再盖一个硫酸厂，每年就可以生产若干万吨酸，而七个硫酸厂每年损失的酸却不过三千五百吨。在维护酸洗的部分设计人员看来，还有一个最难解决的重大问题。他们认为永利宁厂水洗的方法，除尘效率不够高；新业水洗的方法，除尘效率虽然高，但是标准设计的有关条件和新业的又不相同，移植过来除尘效率未必高。在他们看来，这些地方工厂即使有某些好东西，也不过是些不足取法的“旁门左道”。而酸洗是国际标准，最稳妥可靠。工业国家对硫酸生产的除尘指标都定得很高，如果采用水洗，尘土除得不净，虽然不影响产品质量，但是却可能影响下一工段的正常生产。主张改水洗的人们则认为采用什么标准要根据自己的国情。好比你钱多可以穿皮袄，如果你钱少就穿棉袄也一样可以保暖。就是已有二百年工业化历史的英国，在二次大战以后，由于铅材缺乏，有些工厂也采用了水洗。有人说：即使水洗除尘效率差一点也不是什么大问题。永利宁厂的经验证明，即使多点麻烦，并没有影响正常生产。采用新业水洗的方法，除尘效率是否高，目前看来虽然还有一些问题，但是，主张水洗的人们，根据生产工厂的实际经验和工人群众的智慧，举出了许多具体办法，证明只要作一番努力，是完全可以解决的。另外，如果试验泡沫塔水洗的办法成功，除尘效率也很高。他们说：要坚决地贯彻勤俭建国的方针，就要打破隐藏在稳妥可靠后面的因循守旧思想和懒惰思想，就要大胆地改革技术，就要向困难宣战。只有坚决贯彻勤俭建国方针，才能高速度实现国家工业化。
    设计院的同志把账算出来了。根据辩论会上所提意见修改设计方案的结果，硫酸工厂标准设计的投资从八百二十万元下降到五百万元了。就是说，原来建两个厂的钱，现在用来建三个厂还用不完。如果原来计划在第二个五年计划期间用来建设硫酸工厂的投资不变，那么，原来可以建二十几个厂，现在就可以建四十—五十个厂，就可以多生产许多硫酸。另外，还可以节省许多金属材料，由于不需向国外定货，建设时间也可以加快。请看，这是多么大的一个“西瓜”啊！　（本报特约稿）
