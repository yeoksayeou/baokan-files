Combining Science, Teaching, and Production
Jiangsu Establishes Agricultural Science and Technology Network

    (Our dispatch) Jiangsu Province's agricultural scientific research institutions and higher agricultural colleges have adopted a method that combines agricultural science, teaching, and production. This method was proposed after the rectification movement, when the thinking of agricultural scientific workers improved and they urgently demanded to leave their offices, participate in production, connect with reality, and train themselves. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China approved this plan and provided specific guidance for its implementation.
    The "three combinations" are: First, to organically combine the three aspects of higher education institutions, scientific research institutions, and production administration departments, and to clarify that the experimental research topics of colleges and scientific research institutions should adopt a principle of facing the present and taking the future into consideration, thereby unifying the three parties, dividing the work and cooperating, which is beneficial to current production, enriches research content, and at the same time can improve teaching quality. Second, to do a good job in the production work of the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Nanjing Municipal Agricultural Science Research Institute, and the experimental farm of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, set an example, and guide the overall situation. Third, the responsible comrades of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, provincial department and bureau chiefs, and scientific experts in the institute should combine with workers, peasants, and masses with production experience to cultivate experimental fields well.
    Due to the "three combinations," Jiangsu Province has formed a top-down agricultural science and technology network. The specific approach is: to merge the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute and the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute. Under the unified leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the heads of agricultural science research institutes and higher agricultural colleges in Nanjing, fifteen in total, established the "Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Science and Technology Work Committee." Jiangsu Province is divided into six agricultural economic regions, and agricultural science and technology committees are organized separately, with six central stations established based on the original regional experimental stations. In addition to leading the county stations, the central stations also establish key stations in seventeen counties and three sub-key stations. Townships have township stations, communes have technology groups, and production teams have technicians. In this way, the transferred technical cadres, the cadres sent to the countryside from the organs, and the young intellectuals and experienced old farmers in the countryside can all be organized to form an agricultural science and technology work network. The Provincial Party Committee, in accordance with the principle of "unified arrangement and comprehensive training" and the labor training plans of the various institutes and schools, annually draws 20% of the technical force within the establishment of each institute and school to go down to the central stations and county key points for training, requiring them to closely connect with production and the masses, and to do the work themselves, and participate in physical labor appropriately with distinction; requiring them to go deep into the communes, participate in the entire production process from the beginning of spring production to the end of winter crop sowing, not only actively participate in labor, but also create high-yield models, and finally analyze and improve the experience gained from production to the level of theory, and write it into papers.
    This method of "three combinations" has already begun to be implemented, and many researchers have already begun to become figures that farmers are happy to approach.

    科学、教学、生产三大结合
    江苏建立农业科学技术网
    本报讯　在江苏省的农业科学研究机关和高等农业学校，采取了农业科学、教学、生产三大结合的办法。这项办法是经过整风运动，在农业科学工作人员的思想有了提高，迫切要求走出办公室参加生产、联系实际、锻炼自己的情况下提出的。中共江苏省委批准了这项计划并具体领导实施。
    三大结合就是：第一，把高等院校、科学研究机关和生产行政部门三方面有机地结合起来，明确院校和科学研究机关的试验研究课题应该采取面向当前、照顾将来的方针，从而使三者统一，分工协作，既利于当前生产，又丰富了研究内容，同时还可以提高教学质量。第二，搞好江苏省、南京市和华东农业科学研究所试验农场的生产工作，做出样子，指导全面。第三，中共江苏省委负责同志、省级厅部局长和所内的科学专家，同有生产经验的工农群众结合起来种好试验田。
    由于三大结合，江苏省形成了一个自上而下的农业科学技术网。具体做法是：决定把江苏省农业科学研究所和华东农业科学研究所合并。在省委统一领导下，由在南京的农业科学研究所和高等农业学校的负责人十五人建立了“江苏省农业科学技术工作委员会”。江苏全省按六个农业经济区划分别组织农业科学技术委员会，并以原地区试验站为基础，设六个中心站。中心站除领导县站外，还建立十七个县的重点站、三个副点站。乡设乡站，社设技术组，生产队有技术员。这样就可以把下放的技术干部和机关下乡干部以及农村中的青年知识分子、有经验的老农等全部组织起来，形成农业科学技术工作网。省委按照“统一安排、全面锻炼”的原则和各所、校的劳动锻炼规划，每年在各所、校编制内抽20％的技术力量下放到中心站、县点去锻炼，要求他们密切联系生产、联系群众，并亲自动手做工作，有区别地适当地参加体力劳动；要求他们深入到社，自春季生产开始到冬季作物播种结束回来，参加整个生产过程，既要积极参加劳动，又要创造高产典型，最后以生产的体会提到理论上分析、提高，写成论文。
    这个三大结合的办法已经开始实行，许多研究人员并已开始成为农民乐于接近的人物。
