Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 11th: The following is an excerpt of the reply given by Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, head of the first batch of Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea, at the farewell rally held by Premier Kim Il-sung and other North Korean party and government leaders to see off the first batch of CPV troops withdrawing from Korea:

　　As we are about to leave the magnificent Korean land and say goodbye to the heroic Korean people with infinite reluctance, Premier Kim Il-sung and all the leading comrades, amidst their busy state affairs, have taken the precious time to come here to give us parting instructions and encouragement. This is a great honor for all our commanders and fighters. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the first batch of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to the beloved Premier.

　　For more than seven years, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, have fully supported us, and countless touching deeds have emerged; such as Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed his life to protect our wounded soldiers, and Fang Xingfu, who rescued our wounded soldiers regardless of the safety of his own son, and the thirty-odd heroic Korean farmers who sacrificed themselves in the flames of war to deliver food to our army during the Battle of Flying Tiger Mountain. The images of countless great internationalist fighters among the Korean people will forever live in our hearts. In the days after the war, the Korean people were in a period of healing the wounds of war and restoring the national economy, but they still cared for and cherished us in every possible way, helping us solve the problems of training and building sites, and land for growing vegetables. After we return home, we will definitely bring this noble friendship of the Korean people to the 600 million Chinese people, so that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will last forever.

　　We have personally witnessed the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea once turned into rubble under the enemy's inhumane destruction. But we have also personally witnessed that the tenacious Korean people were not discouraged. They buried their sacrificed loved ones, filled in the numerous bomb craters, overcame unimaginable difficulties, and rebuilt their beautiful homes on the ruins with their diligent hands. This spirit of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the Korean people will always be a shining example for us to learn from.

　　Beloved Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung, dear Comrade Chairman Choi Yong-kun, dear leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic! In order to promote the relaxation of the tense situation in the Far East, and to promote the peace and reunification of Korea, we are responding to the statement of the governments of North Korea and China and in accordance with the statement of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, we are about to leave Korea and return to our motherland. However, in the future, we will continue to care about our common cause as we did in Korea. The people of China and North Korea not only have common aspirations for peace, but also have common interests. If the US imperialists dare to destroy the dignity of the armistice agreement and launch another war, they will surely suffer even more tragic defeat.

    感谢对志愿军的爱护和关怀
    张天云中将在朝鲜党政领导人欢送志愿军大会上致答谢词
    据新华社平壤11日电　志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队首长张天云中将，在金日成首相等朝鲜党政领导人举行的欢送志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队大会上的答谢词，摘要如下：
    当我们怀着无限留恋的心情，即将离开壮丽的朝鲜国土，和英雄的朝鲜人民分别的时候，金日成首相和诸位领导同志在国事繁忙中，抽出宝贵的时间，亲自来到这里，给我们作临别的教导和勉励，这是我们全体指挥员、战斗员的莫大光荣。我代表志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队的全体官兵，向敬爱的首相同志表示由衷的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    七年多来，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，全力支援我们，涌现出无数可歌可泣的事迹；像献出自己的生命来保护我军伤员的朴在根，像不顾亲生儿子的安危而援救我军伤员的方兴福，像在飞虎山战斗中为了给我军送饭而在炮火中牺牲了的三十多位英雄的朝鲜农民。朝鲜人民中无数的伟大国际主义战士的形象，将永远活在我们的心里。在战后的日子里，朝鲜人民正处在医治战争创伤、恢复国民经济的时期，但是，仍然无微不至地关怀和爱护我们。帮助我们解决了训练、营建的场地和种菜的土地。我们回国之后，一定要把朝鲜人民这种崇高的友谊带给六亿中国人民，使中朝两国人民的友谊万古长青。
    我们亲眼看到朝鲜的锦绣河山在敌人灭绝人性的破坏下，曾经一度变成了一片瓦砾。但是我们也亲眼看到，顽强的朝鲜人民并没有灰心，他们掩埋了牺牲了的亲人，填平了累累的弹坑，克服了难以想像的困难，用勤劳的双手，在废墟上重建起美丽的家园。朝鲜人民这种革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义的精神，永远是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    敬爱的金日成首相同志、亲爱的崔庸健委员长同志、亲爱的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府诸位领导同志！为了促使远东紧张形势的缓和，为了促进朝鲜的和平与统一，我们响应朝中两国政府的声明和遵照中国人民志愿军总部的声明，就要离开朝鲜返回祖国。但是，今后我们还会像在朝鲜时一样，关心我们的共同事业。中朝两国人民不仅有着共同的和平愿望，而且有着休戚与共的利益，如果美帝国主义敢于破坏停战协议的尊严，再次发动战争，它必定会遭受到更加惨重的失败。
