Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 5th: Japanese public opinion is widely welcoming the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement signed today between China and Japan.

Tokyo's major newspapers all prominently published news of the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement on the front page of their evening editions. "Yomiuri Shimbun" added the headline "A Step Forward Towards the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations" to the news, emphasizing the significant political implications of the trade agreement. "Asahi Shimbun"'s headline was "The Trade Community is Elated." The "Tokyo Shimbun" also published an article pointing out that the strong desire of the Japanese business community and people to sign the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement defeated the opposition of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan.

Takami Shigeyoshi, Executive Director of the Japan-China Import and Export Association, expressed his heartfelt welcome to the signing of the trade agreement. He said that the Japanese government's guarantee is necessary for the full implementation of the agreement. Therefore, we must unite and demand that the Japanese government take effective measures to fully implement the agreement. Tadazumi Kuniyoshi, permanent director of the Japan-China Trade Association, pointed out that the Liberal Democratic Party must be urged to recognize the agreement, and that the agreement should be implemented through the signing of specific trade contracts.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 5th: At its standing board meeting held today, the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations of Japan decided to launch a broad publicity campaign to promote the signature campaign, which began on February 20th, demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The meeting adopted a plan of action for carrying out the publicity campaign. The plan of action stipulates that in carrying out the publicity campaign, it is necessary to expose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and at the same time, it should be emphasized that peaceful coexistence between Japan and China is a way to promote friendly relations between Japan and other Asian countries, which is beneficial to the Japanese people. The publicity should introduce China's consistent implementation of a peaceful policy, the rapid progress of China's economic construction, the ever-improving living standards of the people, and that economic, cultural, academic and other exchanges between Japan and China are closely related to the restoration of diplomatic relations.

    日本舆论欢迎中日贸易新协定
    恢复日中邦交国民会议决定开展宣传运动
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本舆论纷纷表示欢迎中国同日本在今天签订的第四次日中贸易协定。
    东京各大报在今天的晚刊上都在头版显著地位刊登了关于签订第四次日中贸易协定的消息。“读卖新闻”在这则消息上加上“向恢复邦交前进一步”的标题，并且强调指出签订贸易协定的重大政治意义。“朝日新闻”的标题是“兴高彩烈的贸易界”。“东京新闻”还发表文章指出，日本贸易界和人民要求签订第四次日中贸易协定的强烈愿望击退了日本执政的自由民主党的反对。
    日中输出入协会专务理事高见重义表示衷心欢迎签订这项贸易协定。他说，要完全实现协定必须有日本政府的保证。因此，我们要团结一致要求日本政府采取有效措施，以完全实现协定。中日贸易会常任理事国吉直澄指出必须促使自由民主党承认这个协定，同时应该通过签订具体的贸易合同来实现这个协定。
    据新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议在今天举行的常任理事会会议上决定展开广泛的宣传运动，来推进已经从2月20日开始的征集要求恢复日中邦交的签名运动。
    会议通过了展开宣传运动的活动方针。活动方针规定，在开展宣传运动中必须揭穿制造“两个中国”的阴谋，同时应该强调日本同中国和平相处是促进日本同亚洲各国友好相处的途径，这样做有利于日本人民。在宣传中要介绍中国一贯执行和平政策以及中国经济建设突飞猛进、人民生活日益改善的情况，还要宣传日本同中国进行经济、文化、学术等各方面的交流与恢复邦交有密切的关系。
