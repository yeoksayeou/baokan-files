    Abstention
    Wu Lü
    In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, new things appear every day. There are various attitudes towards new things: some enthusiastically support them, some pour cold water on them, and some do not express an attitude.
    In the eyes of the third type of people, not expressing an attitude towards new things is the most "mature" leadership method. To support new things with full enthusiasm like the first type of people is feared to be rash. To pour cold water on new things like the second type of people is feared to make mistakes. Therefore, the best way is not to express an attitude. If it is necessary to express an attitude, it is only to say "neither promote nor oppose." This is equivalent to not expressing an attitude.
    Of course, life is very complex. When some new things first appear, it is difficult to grasp their universal significance at once, and therefore it is difficult to express an attitude for a while. However, this does not matter. The real promoters have an easy way to solve the problem when they encounter new things that are difficult to express an attitude towards, and that is investigation and research. If the promoters also do not express an attitude towards new things, it is only temporary. Not expressing an attitude today is for expressing a clearer attitude tomorrow.
    As for the third type of people mentioned above, they are fundamentally different. Not expressing an attitude towards all new things is their "art of leadership" and their philosophy of life. They take not expressing an attitude as their attitude. This attitude of not expressing an attitude, if it is not using the appearance of "stability" to cover up inner emptiness, is at least holding a negative attitude towards revolutionary life; if it is doing leadership work, it is even more a dereliction of duty. Revolutionaries never conceal their attitude towards life. Revolution is to transform life; how can we talk about transforming life and how can we be called revolutionaries if we conceal our attitude towards life?
    However, this third type of people often say: "Neither promoting nor opposing is better than pouring cold water." In fact, it is about the same. When a tender bud emerges from the soil, crushing it is to stifle it; not watering and fertilizing it and letting it wither is also to stifle it. The newspaper said: After the Beijing Design Institute launched the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, many engineering and technical personnel had concerns, fearing that the leadership would not support them, fearing that the owners and construction units would not agree, and that the conservation measures would not be implemented well, etc. Later, the leadership encouraged Communist Youth League member Huang Jiali to expose many wastes in the Socialist Academy's engineering design, the first shot was fired, people's hearts were uplifted, and the torrent of exposing waste flowed down thousands of miles and was unstoppable. (March 11th, this newspaper) Here, one can imagine that if the leading cadres of the Beijing Design Institute did not adopt an attitude of encouragement and support towards the positive actions of the masses, but "neither promoted nor opposed," then the various concerns of the engineering and technical personnel could not be eliminated, and the "double anti" movement would not have the spectacular situation it has now. What is the difference between this attitude of not expressing an attitude, which is "neither promoting nor opposing," and the opposing attitude of pouring cold water?
    Abstention is a virtue in some things. "Kong Rong letting the pears" is a beautiful story that has been passed down through the ages. Abandoning the right to rest on Sundays and doing more work for the socialist cause is also a manifestation of the Great Leap Forward spirit. Only revolution cannot be abstained from. Abandoning the right to revolution is desertion. What is the problem of not expressing an attitude towards new things? To put it bluntly, it is also abandoning the right to revolution.

    弃权

    跃进声中，天天都有新鲜事物。对待新鲜事物有种种不同的态度：一种是热心支持；一种是大泼冷水；还有一种是不表示态度。
    在第三种人看来，对新鲜事物不表示态度，是最“成熟”的领导方法了。像第一种人那样满腔热情地支持新鲜事物吧，唯恐冒失。像第二种人那样对新鲜事物大泼冷水吧，怕犯错误。于是，最好的办法是不表示态度。若不得不表示态度，也只是“既不提倡，又不反对”。这，还等于不表示态度。
    当然，生活是很复杂的。有些新鲜事物刚刚出现的时候，一下子很难摸透它的普遍意义，因而一时很难表示态度。不过，这不要紧。真正的促进派遇到很难表示态度的新鲜事物，有一个很容易解决问题的方法，这就是调查研究。如果说促进派也有对新鲜事物不表示态度的时候，那只是暂时的。今天不表示态度，为的是明天表示更明确的态度。
    至于上面说的第三种人，那是根本不同的。对一切新鲜事物不表示态度，是他们的“领导艺术”，也是他们的处世哲学。他们以不表示态度为自己的态度。这种不表示态度的态度，如果不是借“稳当”之貌来掩饰内心的空虚，至少也是对革命生活持着消极的态度；若是做领导工作的，更是失职行为。革命者从来不掩饰自己的生活态度。革命，就是要改造生活；掩饰自己的生活态度，怎么谈得到改造生活，怎么称得上是革命者呢？
    然而，这第三种人常说：“既不提倡，又不反对，总比大泼冷水强些。”其实，也是半斤八两。嫩芽从土壤中露头，踩烂它，是扼杀；不去浇水施肥，让它枯死，也是扼杀。报上说：北京市设计院开展反浪费、反保守运动以后，不少工程技术人员有顾虑，怕领导上不支持，怕业主和施工单位不同意，节约措施不好实现等等。后来，领导上鼓励共青团员黄家礼揭发了社会主义学院工程设计中的许多浪费，第一炮打响了，人心振奋，揭发浪费的洪流一泻千里，猛不可挡。（3月11日本报）这里，可以想像，如果北京市设计院的领导干部，对群众的积极行动不是采取鼓励和支持的态度，而是“既不提倡，又不反对”，那么，工程技术人员的种种顾虑不能消除，“双反”运动必无现在这样壮观的局面，这“既不提倡，又不反对”的不表示态度的态度，同大泼冷水的反对态度又有什么两样呢？
    弃权，在有些事情上是美德。“孔融让梨”就是千古美谈。弃星期日休息之权，为社会主义事业多做些工作，也是跃进精神的表现。唯有革命是不能弃权的。弃革命之权，就是逃兵。对新鲜事物不表示态度是个什么问题呢？说干脆点，也就是弃革命之权。
