Editor's Note: The Rural Rectification Office of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CCP recently submitted a very important report to the Provincial Committee, namely the "Opinions on Carrying Out the Rectification Movement in First and Second Category Communes After the Spring Festival." The report proposes that the rural rectification after the Spring Festival should focus on guaranteeing this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and carry out airing of views, debates, and rectification. This opinion is very correct, and the Shanxi Provincial Committee has approved and transmitted this report to the leading organs of party committees throughout the province. Now the preparatory work for spring plowing is very tense, and spring plowing is about to begin. In areas where rural rectification has not yet been completed, rectification can continue based on the experience of the previous stage of rectification, combined with the preparations for and actual spring plowing, to carry out the rural rectification to the end.

    This newspaper reports that the Shanxi Provincial Committee recently approved and transmitted the "Opinions on Carrying Out the Rectification Movement in First and Second Category Communes After the Spring Festival" from the Rural Rectification Office of the Provincial Committee. The full text of the opinions is as follows:

    At present, among the rural rectification movements in our province, 9,758 communes have been completed, and 4,454 communes are in progress. The total of these two accounts for about 68% of the total number of communes in the province. There are still 6,686 communes that will only be able to start after the Spring Festival. We believe that since the vast majority of these more than 6,000 communes are first-category communes and relatively good second-category communes, the problems existing in these communes are different from those in third-category communes. Moreover, the preparation work for spring plowing will reach a tense moment after the Spring Festival. Therefore, carrying out the rectification movement in these communes cannot mechanically copy the rectification methods and steps of third-category communes. Regarding this, we have the following opinions:

    After the Spring Festival, the rectification movement in first-category and second-category communes should focus on guaranteeing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958, and carry out airing of views, debates, and rectification. We should mobilize the masses to launch a major debate on production and construction, break down various ideological obstacles in the Great Leap Forward in production, such as conservative thinking and reliance on the state, boost the enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward, formulate or revise the targets and measures for the Great Leap Forward, and mobilize the masses to take further action. In the course of carrying out the major debate on production and construction, if two-line issues are encountered (such as clamoring that there is not enough food to eat and one cannot work; thinking that increased production is also given to the state, and one cannot eat enough, etc.) that hinder the Great Leap Forward, a major debate on the two lines should be carried out in conjunction to resolve the two-line issues. If the production enthusiasm of the masses is hindered by the ideological and work style problems of party members and cadres, the ideological and work style of the party and cadres should be rectified in conjunction with the rectification of the party and cadres, as well as the rectification of the organization. If the chaotic operation and management of the cooperative hinders the Great Leap Forward in production, the problems in operation and management should be resolved in conjunction, and the advanced experience in operation and management (such as "determining work by output," basic work-day system, "knowing a year in advance," etc.) should be earnestly promoted, and planning management should be strengthened to improve the operation and management work, so as to ensure the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Organizational issues that need to be dealt with in rectifying the party and the league should be carried out on this basis.

    We believe that it is more appropriate to carry out the rectification in accordance with the above methods, based on the situation of the first and second category communes and seasonal conditions. This can more closely combine rectification and production.

### 保证今年农业生产大跃进是当前农村整风运动中心  中共山西省委批转农村整风办公室的意见

    保证今年农业生产大跃进是当前农村整风运动中心
    中共山西省委批转农村整风办公室的意见
    编者按：中共山西省委农村整风办公室最近向省委提出了一个很重要的报告，即“关于春节后在一、二类社进行整风运动的意见”。报告中提出春节后农村整风应以保证今年农业生产大跃进为中心，开展鸣放、辩论和整改。这个意见十分正确，山西省委已将这个报告批转该省各地党委领导机关。现在备耕工作很紧张，春耕即将开始。在农村整风尚未完成的地区，可以根据前一阶段整风的经验，结合备耕和春耕继续进行整风，把农村整风贯彻到底。
    本报讯　山西省委最近批转了省委农村整风办公室“关于春节后在一、二类社进行整风运动的意见”。意见全文如下：
    目前我省农村的整风运动，已经结束的有九千七百五十八个社，正在进行的有四千四百五十四个社，两者合计约占全省总社数的68％。尚有六千六百八十六个社在春节后才能开始。我们考虑：由于这六千多个社绝大部分为一类社和比较好的二类社，这些社所存在的问题和三类社不同，而且春节后春耕准备工作即到紧张时机，因此，在这些社进行整风运动，就不能够机械搬用三类社的整风方法和步骤。对此，我们有如下意见：
    春节后在一类社和二类社进行整风运动，应以保证1958年农业生产大跃进为中心，开展鸣放、辩论和整改。应当发动群众开展生产建设的大辩论，打破生产跃进中的各种思想障碍，如保守思想、依赖国家的思想等，鼓起跃进的干劲，制订或者修订跃进的指标和措施，发动群众进一步行动起来。在开展生产建设的大辩论中，如果遇到两条道路的问题（如嚷叫粮食不够吃不能劳动；认为增了产也是给了国家，自己吃不上，等等）障碍大跃进，就应该结合开展两条道路的大辩论，解决两条道路的问题；如果由于党员、干部的思想作风问题障碍了群众的生产积极性，就应该结合进行整党、整顿干部的思想作风和整顿组织；如果由于合作社的经营管理工作混乱障碍了生产大跃进，就应当结合解决经营管理工作中的问题，并且认真推行经营管理工作中的先进经验（如“以产定工”、基本劳动日制、“一年早知道”等），加强计划管理，使经营管理工作提高一步，以保证农业生产大跃进。在这一基础上进行整党、整团需要处理的组织问题。
    我们认为，根据一、二类社的情况和季节条件，按照上述办法进行整风，比较适宜。这样能够把整风和生产更加紧密结合起来。
