Criticism from the Masses

“Lost and Found”

If someone loses a yuan, they must be very anxious and will try to find it. If they can’t find it, they will blame themselves for being too careless. But some people never ask about losing nearly ten thousand yuan worth of public property.

There is a department (until now, the original owner of the lost property has not been found) that abandoned more than two hundred thousand machine-made red bricks in Xuchang, and have not inquired about it for two years. It is said that these red bricks, worth nearly ten thousand yuan, were transported in 1956 by the buyer in twenty 30-ton railcars from a brick factory hundreds of miles away. After getting off the train, they were transported by more than two thousand rickshaws to both sides of the road west of Xuchang Railway Station. At the time, everyone was very happy to see these bricks, thinking that a factory would be built there. However, for two years, these red bricks have not been used for construction. Instead, they are used to pave the road when it rains or snows; children use red bricks to build small houses; residents use red bricks as courtyard walls; and housewives use red bricks as footrests when washing clothes. Truly, they are stepped on and used everywhere. Of the original one thousand two hundred stacks (two hundred bricks per stack), only one thousand stacks remain.

Passersby feel sorry to see this situation and cannot help but blame the owner of the new bricks for being too heartless. They are distressed that they cannot find the owner to send a message.

Be Vigilant, You Who Carry Guns!

On February 24th, I took train number 52 to Dalian. In the carriage, I saw many officers and soldiers who had all placed their guns on the luggage racks and coat hooks. The train police saw that this situation was very unsafe, so they looked for the team leader. After asking around, they learned that their team leader had gone to the sleeping car. When the train police spoke with a second lieutenant, he irresponsibly said, “That’s not our unit.” Later, another lieutenant was moved by the enthusiastic and responsible spirit of the train police and the conductor, and finally took his gun down.

On the way to Beijing, I saw a captain who boarded the train from Jinzhou Station. He put his gun and document bag on the seat and then left. The train police came and, seeing that no one was taking care of these items, took them away. When the captain returned and saw that his gun was gone, he was a little flustered. When others told him the truth, he said slowly, “This is simply nonsense.” 宋瑞

An Example of Bureaucratic Style

The Shandong Huimin Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Cooperation Department of the CCP Huimin Prefectural Committee are only separated by a wall. It should be very convenient to exchange official documents with each other. However, some comrades in the Huimin Prefectural Commissioner's Office do not do this. They hand over the official documents to the post office for delivery. Recently, we have received three letters from the Huimin Prefectural Commissioner's Office with postage stamps attached. This bureaucratic style should be overturned.

    “失物招领”
    如果有人丢了一块钱，一定很着急，并且会想办法去找。假如找不到，也会责备自己太不小心。可是有些人对丢失近万元的公物，却从不过问。
    有一个部门（直到现在也没找到失物原主），他们把二十多万块机制红砖，丢到许昌，两年来不闻不问。据说这些近万元的红砖，远在1956年，由买主用二十节三十吨车皮，从几百里外的砖厂运来，下火车后，又用二千多辆次人力架子车，把它运到许昌车站西边大路两旁，当时大家看到这些砖很高兴，以为要在那儿建设工厂哩。可是两年来，并没见这些红砖用在建设上。而是当下雨、下雪的时候，用红砖来铺路；小孩玩耍时，用红砖盖小房子；住户用红砖当院墙；家庭主妇洗衣服时，用红砖垫脚。真是脚踩垫地，到处皆是。原来的一千二百顶（每顶二百块）红砖，只剩一千顶了。
    过路人看到这种情形实觉可惜，不禁责备新砖主人太没良心。苦于找不到物主，无法捎个信。

    警惕吧，带枪的人！
    2月24日，我乘五十二次列车去大连。在车厢看到许多军官和士兵，全将枪枝放在行李架和衣帽钩上。乘警看到这种情况实在不安全，便找该队的负责人，左访右问，才知道他们的负责人到卧铺车厢去了。当乘警同一位少尉谈话时，他不负责任地说：“那不是我们单位的。”后来，另一位中尉被乘警与乘务员热情负责的精神感动了，才将自己的枪取下来。
    在去北京的途中，我看到一位从锦州站上车的上尉军官，他把枪枝和文件包放在座位上，便离开了。乘警走来，看到这些东西没有人管，就拿走了。上尉回来一看枪没了，这才有点着慌。当旁人告诉他真情后，他却慢条斯理地说：“简直是胡闹。”　　宋瑞
    官风一例
    山东惠民专署同中共惠民地委合作部的办公地点只有一墙之隔。有什么公文来往，相互传递一下，应说是很方便的。但是惠民专署有的同志不是这样做。他们把公文交给邮局来送。最近我们就收到三次惠民专署贴上邮票寄来的信件。这种官风，应该反掉。
