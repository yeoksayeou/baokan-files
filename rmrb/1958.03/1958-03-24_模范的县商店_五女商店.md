Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch: The Baihuo (General Merchandise) Central Retail Department of Cheng Guan Town, Macheng County, Hubei Province, is a shining example of a county department store.

	This retail department has only five young female salespersons who adhere to the policy of serving the farmers, have established close ties with local farmers, and are affectionately called the "Five Women Store" by the local people. During the spring ploughing and autumn harvest seasons, they take turns carrying loads to deliver goods to the countryside just like men, and harvest wheat and thresh grain together with the farmers, selling goods during breaks in production. After finishing field sales, they visit farmers' homes, chatting intimately with women who rarely go to town, and patiently help them choose goods. They also purchase small local products such as eggs on their trips to the countryside. This kind of rural service greatly reduces the time farmers spend going to town. They also implement a system of "three never leaves" (never leaving the store for sleeping, eating, or holding group meetings) and "selling upon arrival" to make it easier for the masses to buy goods. When some agricultural cooperatives send people to the retail department late at night to purchase urgently needed items such as gas lamp mantles, they immediately get up, get dressed, and open the door to sell the goods.
	The five young female salespersons are Guo Yanqing, Huang Guangxiu, Liu Runhua, Han Cunrong, and Han Shuhua. None of them are older than twenty-six, and they generally only have a primary school education, and are not very familiar with commercial business. Even under these less-than-ideal conditions, they have created many miracles. The retail department carries about two thousand kinds of goods, most of which are small general merchandise of little value, but the salespersons have adopted various supply methods that facilitate farmers' purchases, such as delivering goods to the countryside. On average, each person's daily sales volume reaches about eighty yuan. One day this year, the retail department sold more than 4,500 yuan worth of goods, breaking the store's historical sales record. The error rate in their work has decreased year by year: it was 0.07% in 1956, and dropped to 0.02% last year. The retail department never has expenses such as transportation fees, packaging and storage fees, etc., except for bank loan interest, employee salaries, and the purchase of a small amount of office supplies.
	These five young female salespersons are all Communist Party members or Communist Youth League members, and they overcome difficulties with a revolutionary spirit of hard struggle. They have implemented a work system of working one shift from beginning to end, which they have persevered in for two years. While managing about 2,000 kinds of goods, they also undertake all the work in the store, such as purchasing, storage, transportation, bookkeeping, and odd jobs. Relying on mutual cooperation, they have united to arrange their work and study time well. When one of them delivers goods to the countryside, those remaining in the retail department adjust their labor force and take the initiative to take care of the business at each counter; no matter which salesperson takes sick leave or personal leave, her work is immediately taken over by someone else; when there are more customers at a certain counter and the assigned salesperson is too busy, other salespersons come to support without hesitation. They also take turns studying during the early morning and evening hours when there are fewer customers.

### 模范的县商店——五女商店

    模范的县商店——五女商店
    本报特约新华社23日电湖北省麻城县城关镇百货中心门市部是一个县百货商店的光辉典范。
    这个门市部只有五个青年女营业员，她们坚持执行为农民服务的方针，和当地农民建立了十分密切的联系，被当地群众亲切地称为“五女商店”。每到春耕、秋收季节，她们像男子一样轮流挑担送货下乡，和农民一起割麦、打谷，利用生产空隙时间卖货。等到田间营业结束，又往农民家里串门，和难得上街的妇女细谈家常，耐心地帮忙挑选商品。她们每次下乡还顺便代购鸡蛋等小土产。这样下乡服务，大大减少了农民上街的时间。她们还实行“三不离店”（睡觉、吃饭、开小组会议不离店）和“随到随卖”的制度，便利群众买货。有些农业社派人深夜来门市部采购汽灯沙罩等急用商品时，她们也立即披衣起床，开门售货。
    这五个青年女营业员是郭焱清、黄光秀、刘润华、韩存荣和韩淑华。她们的年龄都不超过二十六岁，一般只有小学文化水平，对商业业务也不很熟悉。就是在这些并不优越的条件下，她们创造了不少奇迹。这个门市部经营的商品约有二千种，绝大部分是价值不大的小百货，但是营业员们采用送货下乡等种种便利农民买货的供应方式，平均每人每天销货额达到了八十元左右，今年有一天门市部曾卖出四千五百多元商品，打破了商店销货的历史纪录。她们工作中的差错率逐年降低：1956年是万分之七；去年降到万分之二。这个门市部除了支出银行贷款利息、营业员工资、购置少量办公用品等外，从来没有运输费、包装保管费等开支。
    这五个青年女营业员都是共产党员或共青团员，她们碰到困难，都以艰苦奋斗的革命精神去克服。她们实行了一天一班顶到底的工作制度，两年来坚持不懈；在经营约二千种商品的同时，她们还担负进货、保管、运输、记账、勤杂等商店里的全部工作。依靠相互协作，她们团结一致地把各人的工作和学习时间安排得很好。当她们中有人送货下乡时，留在门市部的就调剂劳动力，主动照应各柜营业；无论那个营业员请了病假或事假，她的工作马上就有人接替；当某一个专柜的顾客比较多，分工负责的营业员忙不过来时，其他营业员就毫不犹豫地前来支援。她们还利用清晨、傍晚顾客较少的时间，轮流学习。
