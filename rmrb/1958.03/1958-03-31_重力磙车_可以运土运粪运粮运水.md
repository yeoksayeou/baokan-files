    Gravity Roller Cart
    Can Transport Soil, Manure, Grain, and Water
    (By Our Reporter) The peasants of Tangzhuang Township, Fangcheng County, Henan Province, have successfully created a gravity roller cart. This cart has a semi-circular wooden bucket hung on an axle between two wooden circles, with a push handle attached to the outside. When pushing, the cart feels light and moves quickly because the wooden bucket in the middle swings from side to side. A strong laborer can only push four to five hundred jin (approximately 200-250 kg) with an ordinary pushcart, but can push eight hundred to one thousand jin (approximately 400-500 kg) with the gravity roller cart.

    本报讯　河南方城县唐庄乡农民创制成功重力滚车。这种车子是在两个木制圆圈中间的轴上，挂一个半圆形木斗，外面钉有一个推把。推动时，因为中间的木斗左右摆动，便显得又轻又快。一个强劳动力用普通的推车，只能推四、五百斤，用重力滚车就能推八百斤到一千斤。　　　　　　　　（阚　枫）
