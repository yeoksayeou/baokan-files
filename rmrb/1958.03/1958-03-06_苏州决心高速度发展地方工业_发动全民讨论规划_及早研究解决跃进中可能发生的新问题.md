    Suzhou Determined to Develop Local Industry at High Speed
    Launching City-Wide Discussion of Plans
    Studying and Resolving Potential Problems Arising from the Great Leap Forward Early On
    (Our Newspaper, reporter Zhang Jing) Suzhou, a city renowned throughout the country for its special handicrafts and gardens, recently proposed a plan for a high-speed Great Leap Forward in its local industries, with an annual increase of 42%. By 1962, the city's local industrial output value will reach over 1.7 billion yuan, an increase of 4.86 times compared to 290 million yuan in 1957. Among them, the output value of handicrafts will increase 6.5 times in five years.
    This city's formulation of the Great Leap Forward plan for local industry has two characteristics: one is to combine the formulation of the plan with the fight against waste and conservatism, mobilizing the entire Party and all the people to discuss and revise the plan; the other is that the Municipal Party Committee pays full attention to the new problems and new contradictions that may arise during the Great Leap Forward, and immediately takes measures to actively study and resolve them.
    After the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee initially determined the general targets of the plan, it convened a conference of more than 3,000 Party members and cadres on February 24, mobilizing all Party cadres to discuss the leap forward plan using the methods of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate. Through the discussion of the plan, the revolutionary zeal of the vast number of Party members and cadres became even more enthusiastic. Many units further tapped their potential in the discussion and put forward positive suggestions for revising the plan. For example, the Party members of the Industrial Bureau calculated that in five years, the factories under the Industrial Bureau alone could jump 7.16 times, and the output value could strive to reach 810 million yuan. Adding the output value of other departments, it is entirely possible to break through the targets proposed by the Municipal Party Committee. Therefore, they suggested adding another 100 million yuan to the total output value of 1.7 billion yuan. These positive suggestions have enriched the content of the plan. This discussion is still continuing and will be combined with the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement to deepen the discussion into the city's factories, shops, schools, and among the residents.
    While organizing the discussion of the plan, the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee also studied with various departments what changes might occur after the Great Leap Forward. For any problems that can be foreseen at present, they actively organize forces to start solving them as soon as possible. For example, the most pressing problems after the Great Leap Forward are the supply of raw materials and the sales of products. In addition to finding ways to solve these problems locally, they decided that the commercial and industrial departments would jointly organize visiting groups to visit the Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast in batches and phases. Through the visits, they can not only visit and learn, but also order raw materials and promote products. Cooperation between various economic departments is also a key issue. In addition to conducting ideological education for various departments, the Municipal Party Committee also organized the city's industry, handicrafts, commerce, transportation, and other departments to sign a cooperation contract.

### 苏州决心高速度发展地方工业  发动全民讨论规划  及早研究解决跃进中可能发生的新问题

    苏州决心高速度发展地方工业
    发动全民讨论规划
    及早研究解决跃进中可能发生的新问题
    本报讯　记者张竞报道：以特种手工艺和园林之胜闻名全国的苏州市，最近提出了全市地方工业以每年递增42％的高速度实现大跃进的规划。1962年这个市的地方工业产值将达到十七亿元以上，比1957年的二点九亿元，增加达四点八六倍。其中手工业产值在五年内将提高六倍半。
    这个市制订地方工业大跃进规划有两个特点：一是把制订规划和反浪费反保守结合起来，发动全党全民讨论规划，修改规划；一是市委充分注意大跃进中可能发生的新问题新矛盾，并且立即采取措施积极研究解决。
    中共苏州市委在初步确定了规划的大体指标以后，于2月24日召开了三千多人的党员干部大会，发动全党干部用大鸣大放大争大辩的办法，讨论这个跃进规划。经过讨论规划，广大党员干部的革命干劲更加高昂。许多单位在讨论中还进一步挖掘潜力，提出了修订规划的积极建议。如工业局的党员在讨论中算了一笔账，说明五年内全市单是工业局所属的工厂就可以跳七点一六倍，产值可以争取达到八亿一千万元，加上其他部门的产值，完全有可能突破市委提出的指标。因此，他们建议把总产值十七亿元再加上一亿元。这些积极的建议，都充实了规划的内容。现在这一讨论还在继续，并将结合反浪费反保守运动，把讨论深入到全市的工厂、商店、学校以及居民群众中去。
    苏州市委在组织讨论规划的同时，还和各部门研究大跃进后可能会发生哪些变化，凡是目前能预料到的问题，便积极组织力量及早着手解决。如大跃进后首当其冲的是原料供应和产品销路问题。他们除设法就地解决这些问题外，决定由商业部门和工业部门共同组织访问组，分批分期到西南、西北、东北等地访问。通过访问，既可以参观学习，又能订购原材料和推销产品。各经济部门相互之间的协作，也是个关键问题。市委除对各部门进行思想教育外，还组织全市工业、手工业、商业、交通运输等部门订立了一个协作合同。
