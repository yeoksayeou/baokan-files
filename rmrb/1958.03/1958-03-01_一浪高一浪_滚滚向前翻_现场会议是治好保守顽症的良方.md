    Wave Upon Wave, Rolling Forward:
    On-site meetings are a good way to cure conservative stubbornness
    (Our newspaper reporter Miao Yiqin reported) Holding "on-site meetings" is a successful method for promoting a vigorous anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement in national government agencies, learning from, catching up with, and surpassing the advanced, and launching revolutionary emulation.
    Before February 13th, only a few departments in the central government agencies had launched a high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism movements. Although most departments and commissions had mobilized, the movement did not progress quickly. Individual units even lacked enthusiasm, and there were few big-character posters. The Ministry of Food was an example. By the 13th, only nineteen big-character posters had been posted in this ministry. This was because many people believed, "We are busy with business work, where is the time to oppose waste?" "Every year we oppose waste, it's still the same old thing." Some even thought: "Central agencies have nothing to oppose, the whole country is opposing, so we have to follow suit."
    In view of the above situation, before the Spring Festival, the Party Committee of the Central Government Agencies held a series of promotion meetings. The most successful of these meetings was the "on-site meeting" held in the Animal Products Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. At the meeting, comrades from the Animal Products Company introduced to comrades from more than a dozen units in finance, trade, and politics and law, how they set off a high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism movements. Taking the purchasing department of this company as an example, the business work of this department is numerous and tight. To complete the procurement tasks, draft important reports to higher authorities, contact the outside world, and receive visitors, there are only about twenty people in the department. However, they exerted their energy, working from dawn to dusk, completing both business work and carrying out the anti-waste movement well. In five days, they received and contacted 45 person-times externally, drafted and issued 40 documents, drafted an important report to higher authorities comparing the planned prices and actual prices of thirteen commodities in the domestic market, and set off a high tide against waste and conservatism, posting more than 400 big-character posters. The reason they were able to do this was because from leaders to the masses, everyone realized that opposing waste and conservatism was really the key to driving all work, so they had great determination and sufficient energy. After everyone listened to this introduction, ideological problems were resolved. It was not that they did not have time to oppose waste and conservatism, nor was there no waste and conservatism to oppose, but that conservative ideas were at work.
    After the "on-site meeting," representatives from many units returned and held emergency meetings overnight to introduce the experience of the Animal Products Company, examine and criticize the conservative ideas of the leadership, and put forward the revolutionary competition slogan of: learning from Animal Products, catching up with Animal Products, and surpassing Animal Products. As a result, the high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism movements in these agencies, like that of the Animal Products Company, rolled forward, wave after wave. The originally backward Ministry of Food has now changed its backward state and a high tide has appeared. By the 25th, this ministry had posted an average of more than 25 big-character posters per person, of which the Finance and Accounting Department posted an average of more than 100 posters per person, and some even posted more than 500, exposing a large number of waste phenomena and conservative ideas. For example, in 1956, the Ministry of Food prepared to install fixed conveyors in thirty-two grain warehouses, dug the trenches, and built the roof frames for the machines. However, when everything was arranged and the machines were requested from the relevant units, they could not be installed due to the excessively large scale, and there were no such large machines, resulting in a loss of about 3 million yuan. This was exposed this time.
    The Ministry of Commerce, which originally had the idea of "following the crowd," immediately plunged into battle after the representatives visited, under the slogan of "Surpassing Animal Products." The masses created the methods of "five checks, five diligences, and four comparisons." The "five checks" are to check plans, check commodities, check systems, check policies, and check "five airs." The "five diligences" are to think diligently, calculate diligently, check diligently, ask diligently, and write diligently. Finally, there are "four comparisons," that is, comparing energy, comparing quantity, comparing quality, and comparing methods. The leading cadres also focused on proposing "three checks," that is, checking officialdom, checking senility, and checking the leadership of the anti-waste movement. This formed a high tide in the Ministry of Commerce, where waste was encircled and conservatism was attacked from all sides, from top to bottom, from left to right. The two bureau chiefs of the Commercial Group Bureau, when they had something to do during the day, thought, wrote, and posted together with several cadres in the evening, posting more than 100 big-character posters in one night. During the Spring Festival, about 500 people in the subordinate units of this ministry did not take a vacation or only took one or two days off. They proposed: "Exert energy to oppose waste and spend an extraordinary Spring Festival." On the first and second days of the Lunar New Year and on New Year's Eve, the two bureau chiefs and section chiefs of the Metals and Minerals Trading Bureau went to the cadres' dormitories to hold small discussion meetings, chatting about the problems of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, and immediately exposed several major waste phenomena. In order to enable comrades to find materials in time, all the archives of this ministry did not stop working during the Spring Festival. Thus, the number of big-character posters in this ministry quickly increased from the original 4,925 to 17,936 after the Spring Festival, an increase of more than three times in four days.
    Units that had always considered themselves to be "clean departments" also became active after the "on-site meeting." For example, many people in the Nationalities Affairs Commission were not interested in opposing waste in the past, saying that there was not much "oil and water," and they were ready to declare the end of the movement after posting 1,200 big-character posters. After the "on-site meeting," they re-mobilized, emphasizing that opposing waste and conservatism is the key to all work. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm was boosted, and more than 98% of the people participated in the movement. By the 26th, nearly 40,000 big-character posters had been posted, and more than 25,000 important issues and opinions had been raised.
    At present, the revolutionary zeal of these late-starting units has in turn further promoted the revolutionary zeal of the Animal Products Company. On the 26th, the Animal Products Company sent representatives to visit and learn from more advanced units. After returning to the company, they immediately held an emergency mobilization meeting attended by all cadres. At the meeting, everyone was called upon to compete with fraternal units with greater enthusiasm, and specific slogans such as "See who digs deeper and more thoroughly, and see whose 'five airs' are thoroughly defeated" were put forward, and to compete with more advanced units.

### 一浪高一浪　滚滚向前翻  现场会议是治好保守顽症的良方

    一浪高一浪　滚滚向前翻
    现场会议是治好保守顽症的良方
    本报讯　记者缪宜勤报道：召开“现场会议”是推动国家机关掀起声势浩大的反浪费、反保守、比先进、学先进、赶先进，发动革命竞赛的一个成功的方法。
    在2月13日以前，中央国家机关中只有少数部掀起了反浪费、反保守运动的高潮，大部分部、委虽然作了动员，但是，运动进展不快，个别单位甚至劲头不足，大字报寥寥无几。粮食部就是一个例子，到13日为止，这个部才贴出了十九张大字报。这因为有不少人认为“业务工作忙，哪有时间反浪费？”“年年反浪费，还不就是那么回事”。甚至还有人认为：“中央机关没有什么东西可反，全国都反，不得不跟着反一反”。
    根据以上情况，春节前，中央国家机关党委召开了一系列的促进会议，其中最成功的一种会议是在外贸部畜产公司召开的“现场会议”会上，由畜产公司的同志向参加这个会议的财贸、政法等十多个单位的同志介绍了他们是怎样掀起反浪费、反保守运动高潮的？以这个公司的收购处来说，这个处的业务工作是又多又紧，要完成收购任务，要向上级起草重要报告，要对外联系，还要接见来人，处里一共才二十来人，但是，他们发挥了干劲，披星星、戴月亮，既完成了业务工作，又搞好了反浪费运动。五天中，既接见和对外联系了四十五人次，起草发出四十个文件，草拟了向上级的一个十三种商品在国内市场上计划价格和实际价格比较的重要报告，又掀起了反浪费反保守高潮，贴大字报四百多张。所以能够做到这样，是因为从领导到群众都认识到反浪费、反保守真是带动一切工作的纲，因此决心大，干劲足。大家听了这个介绍，思想问题解决了，原来不是自己没有时间反浪费反保守，也不是没有浪费、保守可反，而是保守思想在作怪。
    “现场会议”以后，许多单位的代表回去连夜召开紧急会议，介绍畜产公司经验，检查、批判领导上的保守思想，提出：学习畜产，赶上畜产，超过畜产的革命竞赛口号，这一来，在这些机关里的反浪费、反保守运动的高潮也和畜产公司一样，滚滚向前，一浪高过一浪。原来落后的粮食部现在已经改变了落后状态，出现了高潮，这个部到25日止，平均每人贴出大字报二十五张以上，其中财会司平均每人贴出了一百张以上，甚至有人贴了五百多张，揭露了大量浪费现象和保守思想。例如1956年粮食部曾准备在三十二处粮食仓库安装固定输送机，挖好了地槽，造好了安机器的屋架，可是，当一切安排就绪，向有关单位要机器的时候，却由于规模过分庞大，根本没有这样大的机器，结果未能安装，损失达三百万元左右。这次被揭露出来了。
    原来存在“随大流”思想的商业部，代表们参观回去后，全体干部在“超过畜产”的战斗行动口号下，立即投入了战斗。群众创造了五查、五勤、四比的办法，五查是查计划，查商品，查制度，查政策，查“五气”五勤是勤想、勤算、勤查、勤问、勤写，到最后来个四比，即比干劲，比数量，比质量，比方法。领导干部另外着重提出三查，即查官气，查暮气，查对反浪费运动的领导。这样就在商业部形成一个上下左右全面围剿浪费夹攻保守的高潮。商组局两个局长白天有事，晚上和几个干部同想、同写、同贴，一个晚上，就贴出一百多张大字报。春节期间，这个部的所属单位约有五百多人没有休假或只休一、二天，他们提出：鼓起干劲反浪费，过一个不平凡的春节。大年初一、初二和除夕，五金贸易局两个局长和处长们分头到干部宿舍开片儿会，漫谈反浪费，反保守问题，当即揭发了好几桩较大的浪费现象。为了使同志们及时找到材料，这个部的所有档案室在春节期间都没有停止工作。这样，该部在春节后，大字报即由原来的四千九百二十五张迅速发展到一万七千九百三十六张，四天中，增加了三倍多。
    一向自认为是“清水衙门”的单位，在“现场会议”后，也活跃起来了。如民族事务委员会就有许多人过去对反浪费没有兴趣，说油水不大，在贴出一千二百张大字报以后，他们已经准备将运动宣告结束。“现场会议”以后，他们又重新作了动员，强调指出反浪费、反保守是一切工作的纲。这样，就鼓起了大家的干劲，98％以上的人投入了运动，到26日为止，已经贴出近四万张大字报，提出比较重要的问题和意见有二万五千多条。
    目前，这些后来居上的单位的革命干劲反过来更加促进了畜产公司的革命干劲。26日，畜产公司又派出代表到更先进的单位参观、学习，回公司后，当天下午就召开了全体干部参加的紧急动员大会，会上，号召大家以更大的干劲和兄弟单位竞赛，并提出“看谁挖得深，挖得透，看谁的‘五气’打得彻底”的具体口号和更先进的单位比赛。
