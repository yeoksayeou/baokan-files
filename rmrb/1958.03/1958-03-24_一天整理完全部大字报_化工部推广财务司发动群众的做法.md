The Chemical Industry Ministry Promotes the Practice of the Finance Department in Mobilizing the Masses

(Our Dispatch) The Finance Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, in the movement against waste and conservatism, mobilized all staff to analyze and compile big-character posters. They completed the compilation of over a thousand big-character posters in one day and also found long-unresolved debate topics. The Chemical Industry Ministry's rectification leadership has promoted this practice of the Finance Department to other units.

In early March, the number of big-character posters in the Chemical Industry Ministry's anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign rapidly increased to over 70,000. The Finance Department, with only 56 people, put up nearly a thousand big-character posters. The leaders of the Finance Department originally wanted to identify several common major issues, find solutions through mass debate, and then resolve the few remaining general issues. However, these debate topics were proposed based on general understanding. They were either too broad, making it difficult for everyone to discuss, or there was no difference of opinion to spark debate. More than a dozen topics were determined successively but then rejected. The topics were changed repeatedly, and the debate was repeatedly suspended, affecting the enthusiasm of the masses for rectification.

In order to change this situation, the leaders of the Finance Department decided to start with analyzing and compiling the big-character posters. However, there were so many big-character posters, and the masses, when writing them, were limited by time and form, making it difficult to express their opinions perfectly. If only a few leaders analyzed and compiled them, it would not only take too long but also be difficult to fully understand all the intentions of the masses. Therefore, the leaders decided to mobilize the masses to do it together.

In order to give the masses a direction when analyzing and compiling the big-character posters, the leaders of the Finance Department first analyzed the big-character posters put up by the Finance Section. According to the analysis and summary, the big-character posters exposed seven types of waste problems, such as non-compliance with regulations and extravagant spending. This identified specific methods and requirements for compiling the big-character posters. Then, everyone was mobilized to start together, quickly analyzing each big-character poster by department and section, to see what kind of waste it was, what caused it, how much was wasted, etc. In this way, the entire department spent only one day summarizing three major categories of 53 problems from over a thousand big-character posters, exposing 240 million yuan of waste. At this time, the leaders then identified several major issues related to this year's central task from the summarized issues and determined new debate topics. These topics were directly related to the opinions expressed by the masses, making it easier for the masses to express their opinions in the debate and enabling them to use the problems they raised from various perspectives in the big-character posters as supplementary and enlightening materials. In this way, most of the problems raised in the big-character posters were either included in a general issue or directly resolved during the debate. Once the debate was over, most of the big-character posters were accounted for. (Attached picture)

    一天整理完全部大字报
    化工部推广财务司发动群众的做法
    本报讯　化学工业部财务司在反浪费反保守运动中，发动全司群众分析、整理大字报，在一天内就把上千张大字报整理完毕，并且从中找到了久未解决的辩论专题。化工部的整风领导机构已经把财务司的这种做法，推广到其他单位。
    3月上旬，化工部反浪费反保守的大字报迅速地增加到七万多张，只有五十六个人的财务司，贴出了近千张大字报。财务司的领导上原想找出几个有普遍性的重大问题，通过群众辩论找出解决办法，然后去解决遗留下来的少数一般问题。但是，这些辩论题目都是根据概括的认识提出来的，不是过大，使大家无从谈起；就是没有分歧意见展不开争论。先后确定的十几个题目，都被否定了。题目换来换去，辩论一再中止，影响了群众的整改情绪。
    为了改变这种情况，财务司领导上决定先从分析、整理大字报着手。但是，大字报是这么多，群众在写大字报时，受时间和形式的限制，意见又很难表达得完善，如果只由少数领导人分析、整理，不但时间来不及，也很难完全理解群众的全部意图。因此，领导人就决定发动群众一起动手。
    为了使群众在分析整理大字报时有个方向，财务司领导上首先分析了经费财务科贴的大字报。据分析归纳，大字报共揭露了不遵守制度、花钱大手大脚等七种性质的浪费问题。这就找出了整理大字报的具体作法和要求。接着就发动大家齐动手，很快地以处科为单位，大家分头从每一张大字报分析起，看某些浪费是什么性质的，是什么原因造成的，共浪费了多少等等。这样，全司只用了一天的时间，就从上千张大字报中归纳出三大类五十三个问题，揭发出两亿四千万元的浪费。这时，领导上再从归纳出来的问题中，找出几个同今年的中心任务有关的重大问题，确定了新的辩论题目。这些题目，同群众鸣放的意见直接有关，在辩论中既便于群众各抒己见，也使群众把他们在大字报中从各种角度提出的问题，成为互相补充、彼此启发的材料。这样大部分大字报提出的问题，在辩论中，或是被归纳在一个总的问题中，或是直接解决了。一旦辩论结束，大部分大字报就都有了交代。（附图片）
