    Municipal Party Secretary Goes to Factories to Spark the Flame
    (Our dispatch) The First Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, Ren Zhongyi, Secretaries of the Secretariat, Lü Qi'en, Lin Xiaoxia, Zhang Shude, and Deputy Director of the Municipal Party Committee's State-Owned Industry Department, Wang Xinghua, and other comrades, successively held zone meetings at five locations including Pingfang District, Sanke Shu District, Harbin Woolen Mill, Electrical Machinery Factory, and Flax Textile Factory on February 26th and 27th. They directly met with over 6,000 cadres, veteran workers, and advanced producers from twenty-seven state-owned factories across the city to mobilize a comprehensive upsurge of airing views and contending against waste and conservatism. This approach of leading cadres personally taking action and directly meeting with grassroots cadres to get to the bottom of things was determined by the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat on February 25th.
    In their mobilization reports, these leading comrades of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee analyzed in detail the situation of the rectification movement in the city's industrial enterprises, explaining the necessity of further launching a comprehensive movement against waste and conservatism. They called on the city's workers to immediately launch a new upsurge of airing views and contending with the momentum of "strong winds and heavy rain," to achieve the goal of "blooming on all sides and bearing fruit from top to bottom."
    This leadership method of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee, which is suitable for the new situation, was warmly welcomed by cadres and workers of various factories. Liu Fu, Secretary of the Party Committee of Longjiang Electrical Factory, and Shen Xibo, Director of Harbin Woolen Mill, and others believe that this leadership method of getting to the bottom of things has many benefits. It not only guarantees the quality of implementing the Party's policies and instructions but also reduces the significant amount of time taken up by meetings at each level. Li Rongren, foreman of the tenth workshop of Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, said that he must learn from the revolutionary drive of the leading cadres of the Municipal Party Committee. Li Yanzhang, a labor model of Longjiang Electrical Factory with thirty-nine years of experience, after hearing Municipal Party Secretary Lü Qi'en introduce Su Guangming's deeds created due to great ambition, said that he must compete with Su Guangming in revolutionary drive and overcome all difficulties to complete and overfulfill the leap forward plan.
    According to the decision of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, these leading comrades will immediately go to the front lines of combating waste and conservatism in various factories to supervise the battle.

    市委书记下厂点火
    本报讯　中共哈尔滨市委第一书记任仲夷、书记处书记吕其恩、林肖硖、张树德和市委国营工业部副部长王兴华等同志，先后在2月26、27日两天分别到平房区、三棵树区、哈尔滨毛织厂、电机厂、亚麻纺织厂五处召开片会，直接同全市二十七个国营工厂的六千多名干部和老工人、先进生产者见面，动员全面掀起反浪费反保守的鸣放高潮。这种领导干部亲自出马、一竿子插到底直接同基层干部见面的作法，是2月25日市委书记处讨论确定的。
    哈尔滨市委的这些领导同志们在动员报告中都详细分析了全市工业企业整风运动的形势，说明了进一步全面掀起反浪费反保守运动的必要性。他们号召全市职工要以“刮大风，下大雨”之势立即掀起新的鸣放高潮，达到“四面开花，上下结果”的目的。
    哈尔滨市委这种适合新形势的领导方法，受到各厂干部和职工的热烈欢迎。龙江电工厂党委书记刘甫、哈尔滨毛织厂厂长沈希博等都认为，这种一竿子插到底的领导方法好处很多，它不仅保证了贯彻党的政策、指示的质量，还减少了因层层会议所占去的很多时间。哈尔滨电机厂十车间工长李荣仁表示，一定要学习市委领导干部的革命干劲。龙江电工厂劳动模范、三十九年工龄的老工人李延章，听到市委书记吕其恩介绍苏广铭由于雄心大志所创造的事迹以后，表示一定要和苏广铭比比革命干劲，要克服一切困难，完成和超额完成跃进计划。
    根据哈尔滨市委书记处的决定，这些领导同志紧接着就要分赴各厂到反浪费、反保守前线督战。
