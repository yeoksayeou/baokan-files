    Psychologists Propose Great Leap Forward Initiative
    Work Hard for Three Years, Break Through Key Areas, and Create a New Situation
    (Our report) The Chinese Psychological Society held its first second-term council meeting in Beijing earlier this month.

    This meeting launched a heated discussion on the issue of the Great Leap Forward in the work of the Chinese psychology field. The meeting adopted a proposal to psychology workers across the country. The slogan proposed in the proposal is: "Go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results; concentrate forces, work hard for three years, break through key areas, and create a new situation!" The proposal also put forward the minimum fighting goals: to solve the most common psychological problems raised in China's production and construction and education undertakings within three years, and to propose some high-level works to lay a solid foundation for the development of China's psychology.

    The meeting also held two days of scientific reports. The first day of the report was to introduce the psychological research situation in East Germany, which was obtained by the delegation of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during its visit to East Germany in July last year. The second day was the reading of psychology papers. The council received a total of twenty-four papers from all over the country. From these papers, it can be seen that the academic activities of members all over the country have gradually unfolded, and they have achieved certain results in studying Marxism-Leninism, Pavlov's theory, and Soviet psychology. However, the papers generally lack creative research, the solution of practical problems in life is also very insufficient, and collective research needs to be strengthened. Five papers were read in full at the meeting, and the papers read were discussed.

    心理学家提出跃进倡议
    苦干三年，突破重点，开创新局面
    本报讯　本月上旬中国心理学会在北京召开第一届第二资理事会。
    这次会议对中国心理学界今后工作跃进问题展开了热烈讨论。会议通过了致全国心理工作者的倡议书。倡议书提出的口号是：“鼓足干劲，多快好省，集中力量，苦干三年，重点突破，开创新局面！”倡议书还提出了最低限度的奋斗目标：在三年内解决我国生产建设和教育事业上所提出的有关心理学的最普遍的问题，并提出一些水平较高的论著，为我国心理学的发展奠定坚固的基础。
    会议还举行了两天的科学报告。报告会的第一天是介绍民主德国的心理学研究情况，这些情况是中国科学院心理研究所访德代表团在去年7月间到民主德国考察所得来的。第二天是宣读心理学论文。这次理事会共收到全国各地送来的论文二十四篇。从这些论文中看出，全国各地会员的学术活动已逐渐开展，并且在学习马克思列宁主义、巴甫洛夫学说和苏联心理学方面已获得一定成绩。但是，论文一般缺乏创造性的研究，解决实际生活中的问题也很不够，集体研究还待加强。会上宣读了全篇论文的五篇，并对所宣读的论文进行了讨论。
