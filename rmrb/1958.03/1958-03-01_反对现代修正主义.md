    Against Modern Revisionism
    Konstantinov
    I
    The decisive characteristic and basic law of the present era is the transition of the decadent and obsolete capitalist structure to the rising and increasingly strong socialist socio-economic structure. The growing influence of Marxist-Leninist thought and the unity of nearly one billion people under the banner of socialist countries is the spiritual and political manifestation of this objective process.
    The great victory of Marxism-Leninism eloquently proves that the bourgeoisie and modern revisionists' cries about the so-called "crisis" of Marxism and the "crisis" of communism are ridiculous. Bourgeois thinkers use the existence of revisionism in the workers' movement as a basis for opposing Marxism and proving the "crisis" of Marxism. However, the history of the workers' movement and the history of Marxism prove otherwise. With the victory of Marxism, the enemies of Marxism within the workers' movement put on the guise of Marxism, while driving the revolutionary essence out of Marxism. This was the case with the Bernsteinists. In our era, a similar phenomenon has occurred in the context of the sharpened struggle between socialist and imperialist forces. Some wavering elements within certain Communist Parties, like the Bernsteinists, also want to make Marxism palatable to the bourgeoisie, turning it into something "liberal" that the bourgeoisie can accept.
    In the current situation, one of the reasons for the emergence of revisionist elements within some Communist and Workers' Parties in socialist countries, apart from the pressure from the international and domestic overthrown but not yet completely eliminated bourgeoisie, is the difficulties and contradictions in the development of socialist countries. These difficulties receive different reactions in the consciousness of firm, battle-hardened warriors and those of wavering petty-bourgeois elements. In addition to social causes, revisionism also has theoretical and epistemological roots. This is manifested in the denial of Marxist dialectics or the inability to use this dialectic to explain the complex processes of historical development, the workers' movement, and the development of the communist movement at the current stage.
    The open attacks of bourgeois thinkers on Marxism-Leninism have suffered repeated failures. Therefore, the bourgeoisie places special hope on the possibility of attacking Marxism from within, and under the guise of false, "almost Marxist" pretenses, to achieve greater effect.
    The Declaration of the Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries stated, "While opposing dogmatism, the Communist Parties believe that in the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism. It is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, which paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism."
    Modern revisionism, like the old revisionism of Bernstein and others, is not the result of the development of certain national characteristics of this or that country. Facts show that revisionism in all countries has common characteristics. Modern revisionism has its own system of views. This system involves politics and the tactics of the working-class struggle, as well as philosophy, political economy, the theory of socialism, and other fields.
    What are the representative characteristics of modern revisionism?
    One of the representative characteristics of modern revisionism, like the old revisionism, lies in beautifying and embellishing capitalism, attempting to conceal and erase the sores, shortcomings, and contradictions of capitalism, and treating state-monopoly capitalism almost as socialism.
    It is a historical fact that monopoly capitalism has turned into state-monopoly capitalism, and a series of capitalist industrial sectors have been transferred to the hands of the bourgeois state. However, this can only explain the development of the concentration and socialization of production, the militarization of the capitalist economy, the fact that modern capitalism already possesses the conditions for transitioning to socialism, and that the framework of capitalist private ownership can no longer accommodate modern productive forces.
    These facts illustrate the increasing reactionary, parasitic, and anti-popular nature of modern capitalism.
    Is it not the bourgeoisie that is proving that capitalism has completed its historical mission, that it has not only become an obstacle but also a threat to the survival of millions of people?
    Engels opposed equating state enterprises in capitalist countries with socialism. Like the fake socialists in the nineteenth century who listed state-owned tailoring shops as socialist enterprises, modern revisionism casually regards state-monopoly capitalism as socialist in nature, as a socialist "component." This is to abandon the theory of socialist revolution and to propagate—in Engels' words—that old and decaying capitalism will grow vigorously, easily, and pleasantly into socialism.
    Bourgeois thinkers, reformists, and revisionists also beautify modern capitalism by criticizing the law of the impoverishment of the working class under the capitalist system. These critics of Marxism write that the law of the impoverishment of the working class under the capitalist system, as discovered by Marx, has not been confirmed, and that the living standards of workers are not declining but rising. Thus, the theory of the sharpening of class struggle, the theory of proletarian revolution, and the theory of the inevitable demise of capitalism are now "overthrown."
    These theories and these "overthrows" of Marxism are prevalent at a time when bourgeois politicians, including politicians in the wealthiest capitalist country, the United States, are forced to talk about the poor living standards of broad sections of the population. It is well known that in the United States, about one-third of the population has an income below the minimum living expense recognized by official organs. U.S. President Eisenhower pointed out in 1954 that the shortage of housing was still very acute, that millions of people still lived in slums, and that millions more lived in areas that were no longer suitable for habitation. The situation in the United States is still the same now.
    German Federal Republic Chancellor Adenauer recently admitted in his Christmas message that in West Germany, "there are still many, many poor people and people who are unsure about the future..."
    If we look at the entire capitalist world and the past and present colonies and semi-colonies in Asia, Africa, South America, and Central America, where capitalism has ruled for two or three centuries, every fair-minded person will see an endless ocean of poverty. This is how capitalism and the bourgeoisie have completed their "civilizing" mission.
    Of course, in some capitalist countries, the living standards of certain sections of the working class may have improved somewhat due to the plunder of colonies (dozens or hundreds of colonial slaves working for one European colonialist).
    The United States and some other capitalist countries that served as arsenals of war made mythical fortunes by plundering the people of various countries during the two world wars. The enormous profits from war have enabled some improvement in the living standards of some workers, poisoning their consciousness and making them feel "interested" in profiteering and plundering the people of other countries. And bourgeois economists and revisionists use these facts to refute the laws discovered by Marx!
    Marx never asserted that the economic laws he discovered, including the law of capitalism bankrupting the masses and impoverishing the proletariat, developed in a one-hundred-percent straight line. No, Marx believed that these laws operated as a trend in capitalist society, counteracted by other laws (referring to the laws of proletarian struggle).
    The higher the organization, consciousness, and culture of the working class, the greater its resistance to the bourgeoisie. The working class may force the bourgeoisie to make certain concessions in the course of class struggle in this or that country, especially during periods of high and sharp class struggle.
    In the current conditions, the formation of the world socialist system and the improvement of the political consciousness and organization of the working class have caused the bourgeoisie great concern, frightened them about future social revolutions, and forced them to make certain concessions to the workers. Without the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the bourgeoisie's attack on the working class in capitalist countries would undoubtedly be more severe, and the proletariat's resistance would not be as strong as with the existence of the world socialist camp.
    II
    When examining this or that contemporary event, revisionists always attempt to analyze these events without taking a class struggle viewpoint or the struggle between socialist and capitalist forces, pretending to stand outside this struggle. In fact, when evaluating a series of important contemporary events, they have rolled over to the bourgeois position.
    The revisionists' disregard for the Marxist theory of class struggle and communist party spirit is also exposed in the evaluation of the role of the bourgeois state in economic life, the essence of bourgeois democracy, the struggle in the fields of philosophy and historical science, and the party's attitude towards art and literature.
    When revisionists write about the shortcomings and mistakes of socialist countries, and about the shortcomings and mistakes of the Communist Party in its work, they become indignant and even display eloquence. However, when they talk about capitalism and the bourgeoisie, they stutter, showing a servile appearance, fearing to offend the bourgeoisie. In our time, the imperialist bourgeoisie and its thinkers have a particularly strong hatred for the first socialist country, the Soviet Union. This is natural and understandable. The attitude towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is the standard for measuring every firm Marxist, that is, a proletarian revolutionary. Therefore, it is only natural that revisionists in some countries regard criticizing the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as their main ideological task in order to please the bourgeoisie.
    Why is the entire fire of the revisionists' criticism concentrated on socialist countries rather than on capitalism and the bourgeoisie, which they strive to directly or indirectly defend? These revisionists have even found an ingenious theoretical basis for this. For example, an article by a foreign author writes that modern Marxists incorrectly understand the task of exposing the bourgeois system because they follow Marx, Engels, and Lenin. The article says that this used to be the main task, but now Lenin's successors have found that there was no socialist society in Marx's time, and that Lenin only carried out activities during the birth of socialist society. The author believes that at the present stage, the most important task is to ruthlessly expose the processes occurring within socialist society. We must study the dialectic of socialist society in the same way that Marx used to treat bourgeois society, otherwise our theory will be in a state of weakness and disintegration.
    This is an open justification for refusing to criticize capitalism and a blatant call to criticize socialism.
    Of course, the laws of dialectics and the laws of the development of contradictions also function in socialist society. Here, movement is also developed through the struggle between the new and the old, the struggle between the positive and the negative, and the struggle between things that are developing and advancing and things that are declining and backward. The method of criticism and self-criticism, which was created by our party and has been mastered by the whole people, is Marxist dialectics in practice. However, there is a fundamental difference between the Marxist criticism of capitalism and criticism and self-criticism as a method of building a new society. The purpose of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Marxist-Leninists' criticism of capitalism in the past and present is to enable the working class to carry out a revolutionary transformation of this system. The purpose of the Communist Party and the masses' criticism and self-criticism of certain phenomena in socialist society is to strengthen, defend, and maintain socialism and eliminate obstacles on the road to its advancement. Revisionists criticize socialism in order to weaken its strength and defend capitalism.
    The essence of the bourgeois state and the question of dictatorship and democracy are the most important issues of the day. Under capitalist conditions, the most "democratic" country is always a bourgeois state, that is, a committee that manages the common affairs of the capitalist class—this is a well-known and universal truth of Marxism.
    Following the bourgeoisie, the revisionists also talk about pure, supra-class democracy, opposing "general" democracy to "general" dictatorship. They equate the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is one of the most despicable scams of the modern bourgeoisie supported by the revisionists. Of course, the political form of bourgeois rule is not irrelevant to the proletariat. In the anti-fascist struggle, Marxist-Leninists have always been at the forefront of defending bourgeois democratic freedoms, but they have never forgotten the class, that is, the bourgeois limitations of democracy in capitalist society. Under the capitalist system, that is, in the presence of the two antagonistic classes of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, pure democracy is a lie and deception. The history of recent decades and the current situation eloquently confirm this truth of Marxism.

    反对现代修正主义
    康斯坦丁诺夫
    一
    现时代的决定性特征和基本规律是腐朽过时的资本主义结构正在向旭日东升的、日益发展壮大的社会主义社会经济结构过渡。马克思列宁主义思想影响的日益增长，社会主义国家将近十亿人民团结在它的旗帜下，便是这一客观过程在精神上和政治上的表现。
    马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利雄辩地证明，资产阶级和现代修正主义者发出的关于所谓马克思主义“危机”、共产主义“危机”的叫嚣是十分可笑的。资产阶级的思想家们利用工人运动中存在修正主义这一点作为反对马克思主义的根据，来证明马克思主义的“危机”。但是，工人运动的历史和马克思主义的历史却作出了另外的证明。随着马克思主义的胜利，在工人运动内部的马克思主义的敌人换上了马克思主义的装束，同时把革命的本质由马克思主义里面驱将出来。伯恩施坦派当时就是这样。而在我们这个时代，在社会主义力量和帝国主义力量之间的斗争尖锐化的情况下也发生了某种类似的现象。某些共产党内部的不坚定分子与伯恩施坦派一样也想使马克思主义适合于资产阶级的口味，使马克思主义变为资产阶级可以接受的“自由主义的”东西。
    在现代情况下，社会主义国家某些共产党和工人党内部出现修正主义分子的原因之一，除了国际的和本国已被推翻的、但尚未完全消灭的资产阶级的压力而外，还有社会主义国家在发展方面的困难和矛盾。这些困难在坚定的经过千锤百炼的战士和那些不坚定的小资产阶级分子的意识中得到了不同的反应。除了社会原因以外，修正主义还有理论和认识论上的根源。这表现在否认马克思辩证法或不善于把这种辩证法用来解释现阶段历史发展、工人运动和共产主义运动发展的复杂过程。
    资产阶级的思想家们对马克思列宁主义的公开进攻遭到接二连三的失败。因此，资产阶级就把特别的希望寄托在：从内部，而且在虚伪的、“差不多是马克思主义的”幌子下攻击马克思主义可能获得更大的效果。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言说，“在反对教条主义的同时，共产党认为，在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。”
    现代修正主义同过去的伯恩施坦之类的修正主义一样，不是这个或那个国家某些民族特点发展的结果。事实表明，一切国家里的修正主义都具有共同的特点。现代修正主义有自己的观点体系。这个体系既涉及到政治和工人阶级斗争的策略，也包括了哲学、政治经济学、社会主义理论等领域。
    现代修正主义的代表性特点是什么呢？
    现代修正主义的代表性特点之一，也如旧修正主义一样，在于美化和粉饰资本主义，企图掩饰和抹去资本主义的脓疮、缺点、矛盾，把国家垄断资本主义几乎当做社会主义。
    垄断资本主义变为国家垄断资本主义，一系列资本主义工业部门转到资产阶级国家手里，这是历史事实。但是，这只能说明生产的集中和社会化的发展，说明资本主义经济的军事化，说明现代资本主义已经具备向社会主义过渡的条件了，说明资本主义私有制的框框已经容纳不下现代生产力了。
    这些事实说明了现代资本主义的反动性、寄生性、反人民性的增长。
    这不正是资产阶级在证明，资本主义已经完成了自己的历史使命，它不单是已经成为一种障碍，同时已经成为千百万人生存的威胁了。
    恩格斯当年就反对把资本主义国家的国家企业同社会主义混为一谈。同十九世纪的把国营裁缝店列为社会主义企业的冒牌社会主义者一样，现代修正主义也随随便便地把国家垄断资本主义说成是社会主义性质的，说成是社会主义的“成分”。这样便是放弃社会主义革命理论，并且宣传——用恩格思的话来说——旧的而且腐朽的资本主义会生气勃勃地、简易地、愉快地自由长入社会主义。
    资产阶级的思想家、改良主义者和修正主义者还通过批评资本主义制度下工人阶级贫困化的规律来美化现代资本主义。这类的马克思主义的批评家们写道：马克思所发现的在资本主义制度下工人阶级贫困化的规律没有得到证实，工人的生活水平不是在下降，而是在上升。从而，据说马克思主义的阶级斗争尖锐化理论、无产阶级革命理论、资本主义必然灭亡理论现今“被推翻了”。
    这些理论以及对马克思主义的这些“推翻”流行的时候，正是资产阶级政治家、包括资本主义最富裕的国家美国的政治家们被迫谈到广大阶层居民贫困的生活水平的时候。大家知道，在美国约有三分之一的居民的收入低于官方机关承认的最低生活费。美国总统艾森豪威尔在1954年曾经指出，住宅不足的情况仍然是十分尖锐的，成百万人仍旧住在贫民窟里，还有成百万人住在已经不适于居住的地区。现在美国的情况依然是这样。
    德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳不久前在圣诞节祝词中承认，在西德“还有很多很多的穷人和对前途没有把握的人……”
    如果拿整个资本主义世界及资本主义统治两三个世纪的亚洲、非洲、南美和中美洲过去和今天的殖民地和半殖民地来看，那么每一个公正的人都会看到是一片贫穷无涯的海洋，资本主义和资产阶级就这样完成了自己的“文明者”的使命。
    当然，在某些资本主义国家里，由于掠夺殖民地（几十几百个殖民地的奴隶为一个欧洲殖民主义者工作），工人阶级某些阶层的生活水平可能有一些提高。
    美国和其他一些充当战争军火库的资本主义国家在两次世界大战中依靠掠夺各国人民而神话一般地发了横财。依靠战争的暴利使得部分工人的生活水平有了一些提高，毒害了他们的意识，使他们对暴利和掠夺其他国家人民感到“兴趣”。而资产阶级的经济学家和修正主义者却拿这些事实来反驳马克思发现的规律！
    马克思始终没有断言说，他发现的经济规律，其中包括资本主义使人民群众破产和使无产阶级贫困化的规律是百分之百地直线发展的。不，马克思认为，这些规律在资本主义社会是作为一种趋势而发生作用，它受到其他规律（这里指的是无产阶级斗争的规律）的反作用。
    工人阶级的组织、觉悟和文化越高，它对资产阶级的反抗力就越大。工人阶级在这个或那个国家的阶级斗争过程中可能迫使资产阶级做出某些让步，特别是在阶级斗争形势高涨和尖锐化时期。
    在当前条件下，世界社会主义体系的形成，工人阶级的政治觉悟和组织性的提高使资产阶级大伤脑筋，使他们对未来的社会革命感到骇怕，迫使他们对工人做了一定的让步。如果没有苏联和其他社会主义国家，资产阶级对资本主义国家工人阶级的进攻毫无疑问会更厉害一些，而无产阶级的反抗力量也不会像有世界社会主义国家阵营存在那样。
    二
    修正主义者在考察当代的这种或那种事件时，总是企图不从阶级斗争观点，不从社会主义力量和资本主义力量斗争的观点来分析这些事件，而是做出站在这一斗争之外的样子。其实，在评价当代一系列重要事件时，他们是滚到资产阶级立场上了。
    在评价资产阶级国家在经济生活中的作用，资产阶级民主的实质，哲学、历史科学领域中的斗争，党对待艺术和文学问题上，也暴露了修正主义者无视马克思主义阶级斗争理论和共产主义党性。
    当修正主义者写社会主义国家的缺点和错误时，写共产党在工作中的缺点和错误时，他们便愤怒不已，甚而显出了雄辩的才能。可是，当他们谈到资本主义和资产阶级的时候，便结结巴巴起来，显出一付奴颜婢膝相，很怕得罪资产阶级；在我们的时代，帝国主义资产阶级及其思想家对第一个社会主义国家苏联的憎恨特别强烈。这是自然的，也是可以理解的。对待苏联和对待其他社会主义国家的态度是测定每一个坚定的马克思主义者即无产阶级革命者的标准。因此，一些国家的修正主义者为了讨好资产阶级而把批评苏联和苏联共产党看做是自己的主要思想任务，也是理所当然的。
    为什么修正主义者的整个批评的烈火都集中在社会主义国家而不是集中在他们所竭力直接或间接维护的资本主义和资产阶级的身上，这些修正主义者甚至为这找出了一个独出心裁的理论根据。例如，在一位外国作者写的一篇文章里写道，现代的马克思主义者因为追随马克思、恩格斯和列宁而不正确地理解了揭露资产阶级制度的任务。文章说，从前这是主要的任务，而现在列宁的继承者却发现在马克思生活的时代尚没有社会主义社会，而列宁只是在社会主义社会诞生时期进行活动的。作者认为在现阶段，头等重要的任务就是无情地暴露社会主义社会内部发生的过程。必须以马克思用来对待资产阶级社会的方法来学习社会主义社会的辩证法，不然我们的理论就会处于虚弱和瓦解状态。
    这是为拒绝批判资本主义而公开辩解和明目张胆地号召批评社会主义。
    当然，辩证法规律、矛盾发展的规律在社会主义社会也起作用。在这里，运动也是通过新与旧的斗争、正面和反面的斗争，发展的、前进的事物同衰亡的、落后的事物之间的斗争向前发展的。我党所创立的、已经为全民所掌握的批评和自我批评的方法是实践中的马克思辩证法。然而，马克思主义者对资本主义的批判和作为建设新社会方法的批评和自我批评，这两者之间有着原则性的区别。马克思、恩格斯、列宁，马克思列宁主义者在过去和现在对资本主义的批判，其目的是为了使工人阶级对这个制度实行革命的改造。共产党和群众对社会主义社会的某种现象的批评和自我批评，目的是要加强、保卫和维护社会主义，消除它在向前发展的道路上的障碍。修正主义者批评社会主义却是为了要削弱它的力量和保卫资本主义。
    资产阶级国家的实质、专政和民主的问题是当前最重大的问题。在资本主义条件下，最“民主”的国家始终是资产阶级国家，即管理资本家阶级共同事务的委员会——这就是马克思主义的一个众所周知的普遍真理。
    跟在资产阶级后面，修正主义者也高谈纯粹的、超阶级的民主，把“一般的”民主同“一般的”专政对立起来。他们把无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政等同起来。这就是修正主义者所支持的现代资产阶级最卑鄙的骗局之一。当然，资产阶级的政治统治形式不是与无产阶级无关的。在反法西斯斗争中，马克思列宁主义者一向是带头保卫资产阶级民主自由，但是他们从来没有忘掉资本主义社会的民主所具有的阶级的、即资产阶级的局限性。在资本主义制度下，即存在无产阶级和资产阶级这两个对抗性阶级的情况下，纯民主是假话、是骗人。近几十年的历史和现代情况雄辩地证实了马克思主义的这一真理。
