Mental Preparation is More Important
Many regions have begun to inspect spring plowing preparations, which is very necessary. However, more importantly, we should thoroughly examine the ideological preparedness of cadres at all levels and the masses. In Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, 25% of cadres at the production team leader level and above have doubts or resistance towards this year's production increase plan; 35% of farmers still harbor a wait-and-see attitude, wavering and indecisive. It is evident that there are still quite a few people with insufficient ideological preparation. People say it well: only with a great leap forward in thought can there be a great leap forward in production. The same applies to spring plowing preparations. Therefore, we hope that all localities, when inspecting preparatory work for plowing, will pay special attention to ideological mobilization and ideological comparison.

    思想准备更重要
    许多地区都开始了检查春耕准备工作，这很需要；但是，更重要的，应当深入检查一下各级干部和群众的思想准备。江西南昌县的生产队长以上干部有25％的人对今年增产计划有怀疑，有抵触；35％的农民犹自心存观望，动摇不决，可见思想准备不足的人还有不少。人们说得好，只有有了思想上的大跃进，才有生产上的大跃进，春耕准备也是如此。因此，希望各地在检查备耕工作中，特别要注意思想发动，思想评比。
