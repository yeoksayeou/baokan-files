Agricultural Production Great Leap Forward Must Not Stagnate!
	Grasp Ideology, Reform Tools, Break Through Difficulties
	Hunan Province Promotes the Advanced Experiences of Tool Innovation in Counties Such as Changning and Pingjiang
(Reported by this newspaper) To conquer the difficulty of insufficient labor in the current agricultural production Great Leap Forward, a vigorous tool reform movement is unfolding in the rural areas of Hunan Province. Changning County, Wengjiang Township in Pingjiang County, Renfeng Cooperative in Nanxian County, and Hangongdu Township in Changde County have already made outstanding achievements. In order to greatly promote this movement, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is promoting the advanced experiences of these four typical examples. The Hunan Provincial Committee pointed out the guiding principles for carrying out the tool reform movement: mobilize the whole people, involve the entire Party, make overall plans, arrange in stages, proceed from near to far, combine the near and the far, proceed from small to large, and combine the large and the small. It also called for boldly mobilizing the masses to achieve a great innovation and a great leap forward.
	With the development of the Great Leap Forward in production, especially after entering the stage of spring plowing and large-scale production, the problem of insufficient labor has become an increasingly common and acute problem in the rural areas of Hunan Province. For example, in order to realize the plan of accumulating 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu and producing 1,000 jin of grain per mu, Changning County maintained a work attendance rate of 70% of the total population, but still had a labor deficit of 20 million workdays. Wengjiang Township in Pingjiang County plans to produce 1,500 jin of grain per mu this year, and the labor deficit is more than 15%. Hangongdu Township in Changde County needs 36% more labor days this year for the Great Leap Forward than last year. Each laborer in the township has to work an average of 336 workdays, which is actually impossible.
	In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor, many regions have adopted methods of increasing labor intensity and working overtime day and night to rush the work. Although the masses have high enthusiasm for production, it cannot be sustained. For example, in Renfeng Cooperative in Nanxian County, 60% of the members got up early and worked late to rush to accumulate fertilizer, but the task still could not be completed. Faced with this serious difficulty, various ideological situations emerged. Seeing that the tasks of preparatory farming work could not be fully completed, the cadres of Renfeng Cooperative felt distressed, and the masses' confidence wavered. Many people believed that "the Great Leap Forward can only stop here." Among the 92 township and cooperative cadres in Wengjiang Township, Pingjiang County, 12% had negative and retreating emotions. They said, "It is better to do one inch thick than one foot wide," advocating shrinking the plan; about 16% advocated insisting on long-term overtime work day and night; about 47% were distressed and worried, saying, "This is like a monk shaving his head, all methods have been exhausted," feeling that there were not many solutions; only about 25% believed that the plan must be firmly realized, and the lack of labor can be solved by relying on the masses to find solutions.
	Will the Great Leap Forward stop in the face of insufficient labor? A great debate was launched around this issue. As a result of the debate, the fundamental way to solve the problem of insufficient labor was found—vigorously improve production conditions, increase labor productivity, and carry out a mass tool reform movement. The Party committee of Wengjiang Township, Pingjiang County, led the masses to carry out a mass debate, mass contribution of ideas, and mass innovation movement. In the great debate, they calculated three accounts: the labor deficit, the improvement of tools and the improvement of work efficiency, and the increase in income from completing the production plan. The masses realized that reforming tools was the way out for the Great Leap Forward and strengthened their confidence in realizing the leap forward plan. Renfeng Cooperative in Nanxian County held meetings of old peasants and mass meetings. After a fierce confrontation between advanced and conservative ideas, everyone's minds were suddenly enlightened, and they saw the future of technological reform. In one evening, the cooperative cadres and members put forward 125 rationalization proposals on reforming tools, transforming roads, and improving work efficiency. In the movement to realize water conservancy in Hangongdu Township, Changde County, it was proposed to build ditches and harbors for navigation. At first, 60% of the cooperative cadres disagreed, thinking that "there is not enough labor, the more ditches are built, the less labor there will be." The Party committee of this township mobilized the masses to take stock and calculate accounts before concluding that it was promising to change carrying by shoulder to transportation by boat. For example, Mengshui Cooperative in this township needed more than 18,600 workers to transport fertilizer by shoulder, while building harbors and changing to transportation by boat only required 6,500 workers. Adding the 1,300 workers spent on building ditches, it still saved 60% of the labor compared to carrying by shoulder. In this way, the cooperative cadres and the masses became very enthusiastic about water transportation.
	After breaking through layers of ideological obstacles, the tool reform movement formed a upsurge. The tool reform movement in Changning County has developed quickly, well, and economically. It has now created 12,400 vehicles and 104 "air transportation bamboo ropeways" and nearly 1,000 other new agricultural and sideline tools. According to the new tools that have been promoted, 80.5% of the 20 million labor days lacking in the county have been solved. In more than half a month, the masses in Wengjiang Township, Pingjiang County, under the mobilization slogan of "Great Innovation, Great Leap Forward; Small Innovation, Small Leap Forward; No Innovation, No Leap Forward," created and improved 15 kinds of tools. According to preliminary calculations of the current effectiveness, these tools, when universally promoted throughout the township, can completely make up for the labor deficit and still have a large surplus. The Party committee of Hangongdu Township, Changde County, mobilized the masses to open ditches, dredge harbors, and build boats, realizing water transportation in one month. Transportation by boat to every cooperative, transporting fertilizer and production were greatly facilitated, saving the whole township 1.16 million transport workers a year.

    农业生产大跃进岂能止步不前！
    抓思想改工具  突破难关
    湖南省推广常宁平江等县工具革新的先进经验
    本报讯　为了征服当前农业生产大跃进中劳动力不足的困难，一个蓬蓬勃勃的工具改革运动在湖南全省农村展开。常宁县、平江县瓮江乡、南县仁丰社和常德县韩公渡乡已经做出了突出的成绩。中共湖南省委为了把这个运动大大推进一步，正在推广这四个典型的先进经验。湖南省委指出了开展工具改革运动的方针：全民动员、全党动手，全面规划、分段安排，由近及远、远近结合，由小到大、大小结合。并且号召放手发动群众，来一个大革新大跃进。
    劳动力不足的问题，随着生产大跃进的发展，特别在进入春耕大生产的阶段之后，日益成为湖南省农村中普遍而尖锐的问题。例如常宁县为了实现亩积千担肥、亩产千斤粮的计划，全县保持占总人口70％的出工率，仍有二千万个劳动赤字。平江县瓮江乡今年计划亩产粮食一千五百斤，劳动赤字在15％以上。常德县韩公渡乡今年大跃进需要的劳动日比去年增加36％，全乡每个劳动力平均要出三百三十六个工，实际上做不到。
    为了克服劳动力不足的困难，不少地区采用了增加劳动强度、日夜加班赶工的办法，群众生产情绪虽然很高，但是不能持久。像南县仁丰社全社60％的社员起早贪黑突击积肥，任务还是不能完成。在这种严重的困难面前，出现各种各样的思想情况。仁丰社的干部和群众，眼看备耕工作的各项任务不能全面完成，干部感到苦恼，群众信心动摇。不少人认为“大跃进只能到此止步”。平江县瓮江乡的九十二个乡干部和社干部中，有12％的人产生了消极退却的情绪，他们说，“宽做一尺，不如厚做一寸”，主张缩小计划；16％左右的人主张坚持长期日夜加班；有47％左右的人苦闷发愁，说，“这一下是和尚剃头尽了法”，感到办法不多；只有25％左右的人认为实现计划必须坚决，劳动力缺乏可以依靠群众想办法。
    大跃进是不是在劳动力不足的面前止步呢？围绕着这个问题的大鸣大放大辩论展开了。辩论结果，找到了解决劳动力不足问题的根本道路——大力改善生产条件，提高劳动生产率，开展群众性工具改革运动。平江县瓮江乡的党委领导群众开展了全民大辩论、全民献计、全民革新运动。在大辩论中算了劳动力亏空、改良工具与提高工效、完成生产计划增加收入三笔账，群众认识到改革工具是大跃进的出路，坚定了实现跃进计划的信心。南县仁丰社召开了老农会和群众会。在先进思想和保守思想进行激烈的交锋之后，大家的脑子豁然开朗，看清了技术改革的前途。一个晚上，社干部和社员就在改革工具、改造道路、提高工效等方面，提出了一百二十五条合理化建议。常德县韩公渡乡在实现水利化运动中，号召修沟港通航船，起初有60％的社干部不同意，认为“劳动力本来不够，越修沟就越不够”。这个乡的党委发动群众摸底算账，才得出肩挑改船运大有可为的结论。如这个乡的孟水社肩挑运肥，需工一万八千六百多个，而修港改船运，只需工六千五百个，加上修沟花工一千三百个，还比肩挑节省60％的劳动力。这样，社干部和群众对水运化大大积极起来。
    突破层层思想障碍以后，工具改革运动形成了热潮。常宁县的工具改革运动发展得又多又快又好又省，现在已经造成了一万二千四百部车子，并造成了“空中运输竹索道”一百零四条和其他农副业新式工具近千件。按照目前已经推广的新式工具计算，全县缺少的二千万个劳动日，已经解决了80.5％。平江县瓮江乡群众在“大革新，大跃进；小革新，小跃进；不革新，不跃进”的动员口号下，半月多的时间内，就创造和改良了十五种工具。根据现有效能初步计算，这些工具在全乡普遍推广后，可以全部弥补劳力赤字还大有剩余。常德县韩公渡乡的党委，发动群众开沟疏港、整船造船，一个月中实现了水运化。社社通船、运肥、生产大为便利全乡一年可节省一百一十六万个运输工。
