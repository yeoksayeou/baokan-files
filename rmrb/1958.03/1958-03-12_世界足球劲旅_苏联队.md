World Football Powerhouse - The Soviet Team

A few years ago, the Soviet team caused a sensation around the world by defeating the then-world champion West Germany team. Subsequently, they won the championship at the 16th Melbourne Olympic Games in 1956. Since then, people from all countries have unanimously regarded the Soviet football team as one of the world's football powerhouses.

The players of the Soviet national football team visiting our country this time are selected from the best Soviet teams such as Moscow "Dynamo", Moscow "Lokomotiv", Moscow "Spartak", Moscow "Torpedo", and "Central Sports Club of the Army", which can be said to represent the essence of Soviet football. This football team has a very different lineup from the Soviet football team that participated in the 16th Olympic Games and the Soviet national team last year. Only Yashin, Okonnikov, Kuznetsov, Netto, Tatushin, Simonian, Isaev, and Ilyin remained from the 16th Olympic Games participants. Others, like goalkeeper Maslachenko and Pilyayev, and forwards Apukhtin and Metreveli, were rising stars who performed well in 1957. One of the characteristics of this football team is their superb technique, youthful strength, and strong fighting spirit.

The players visiting our country this time are all first-class Soviet football players, among whom the more famous are Yashin, the most outstanding goalkeeper in Europe, Netto, the world's most outstanding midfielder, and Tatushin, a right winger known internationally for his short stature and fast speed. The midfielders who came this time: Netto and Voinov, are completely attacking players. Netto is currently the senior player in the Soviet national team. He has been a member of the national team since the 15th Olympic Games in 1952. His skills and experience are outstanding, and his attacking ability is even better. He is very active in entering and leaving the midfield, dribbling, and passing the ball, and often creates extraordinary achievements when the forwards cannot score. Center forward Simonian and Gusarov are also agile and strong-footed forwards. Their personal breakthrough skills are amazing. In the match against the Shanghai Red Team in Shanghai, Gusarov alone scored five goals. In addition, Ilyin, Kovalev, Apukhtin, and Metreveli on the forward line are all dangerous figures with fast sprints and strong shots. Among the three goalkeepers, Yashin has the most experience. He was named the best goalkeeper in Europe in 1957. However, the three of them have similar movements and skills and are very confident in both high and low balls. Defenders Kryzhevsky, Kuznetsov, and Okonnikov are all outstanding talents on the defensive line.

Fast speed and sufficient stamina are traditional advantages of Soviet football. In addition to being good at playing football, the players of the Soviet football team are also masters in the field of track and field. They have excellent elasticity and are quite confident in heading the ball. Their speed is also amazing, especially in the moment of transitioning from defense to attack; when attacking, the speed of the two wingers is very fast.

    世界足球劲旅——苏联队
    几年前，苏联队曾经以战胜上 届世界冠军西德队而轰动世界，接着又在1956年墨尔本十六届奥运会上夺得冠军。从此以后，各国人们一致认为苏联足球队是世界足球劲旅之一。
    这次来我国访问的苏联国家足球队的队员是选自莫斯科“狄纳莫”队、莫斯科“火车头”队、莫斯科“斯巴达克”队、莫斯科“鱼雷”队、“中央苏军俱乐部”队等苏联的第一流球队，可以说是集中了苏联足球界的精华。这个足球队与苏联参加十六届奥运会足球队以及去年的苏联国家队，在阵容上有很大的不同。当时参加十六届奥运会的仅留下了雅辛、奥克尼柯夫、库兹?佐夫、奈托、塔图辛、谢孟良、伊萨耶夫、伊里因等人，其余的像守门员马斯拉钦科、皮良也夫，前锋中的阿普赫金、麦特列维里，都是在1957年表演出色的后起之秀。这个足球队的特点之一是技术精湛，年轻力壮，斗志旺盛。
    这次来我国访问的都是苏联第一流足球选手，其中比较著名的有欧洲最优秀的守门员雅辛，世界上最出色的前卫奈托，个子矮、速度快驰名国际的右翼塔图辛。这次来的前卫：奈托、伏意诺夫，完全是攻击型的球员。奈托是目前苏联国家队中的老大哥，从1952年十五届奥运会起，他就是国家队的队员，球技、经验都超人一等，进攻本领更佳，进出中场，盘球传球非常活跃，常常在前锋不能得分情况下创建奇功。中锋谢孟良和古萨洛夫也是动作灵敏、脚头坚硬的前锋人材，他们两人的个人突破本领是惊人的。这次在上海对上海红队一战，古萨洛夫一个人就射进了五个球。另外，锋线上的伊里因、科瓦列夫、阿普赫金和麦特列维里等都是冲刺快、脚头硬的危险人物。三位守门员，雅辛经验最丰富，他曾被评为1957年欧洲最佳的守门员。但他们三人的动作和技巧相差不大，无论高、低球，都很有把握。后卫克雷热夫斯基、库兹?佐夫和奥克尼柯夫都是卫线上的杰出人材。
    速度快，体力足是苏联足球的传统优点。苏联足球队队员除了擅长踢足球外，还都是田径场上的能手，弹性极好，头顶相当有把握。他们的速度也是惊人的，特别是由守转攻的一刹那；进攻时，两个边锋的速度非常快。
