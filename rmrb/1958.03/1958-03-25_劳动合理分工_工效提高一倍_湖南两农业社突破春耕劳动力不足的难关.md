(From New Hunan Daily) To overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor during the great leap forward in agricultural production, especially during the current busy spring ploughing season, two agricultural production cooperatives in Hunan Province have rationally improved labor organization and strengthened labor management, greatly improving labor efficiency.

The Heshang Cooperative in Maojiatan Township, Hanshou County, shortened the daily working hours of each laborer by two hours and doubled the work efficiency by improving labor organization.

Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward this year, the members of the Heshang Cooperative were very motivated. They started work at 4:30 every day and did not stop until 8:00 or 9:00 in the evening. The number of people mobilized often reached around 700. It was truly "a large group going to work, a continuous line on the road," with broadcasting, gongs, and shouts all day long. However, the labor efficiency of each production team in the cooperative was not high. For example, the twelfth production team had 83 laborers. The 31 people accumulating fertilizer had an average efficiency of only 37 loads per day; the 35 people transporting fertilizer had an average efficiency of only 27 loads per day within a distance of one li; and the 11 people turning the compost pits had an average efficiency of only eight cubic meters per day. The efficiency of ploughing the fields was also similarly low. The main reason for the low labor efficiency was that there were many problems in the labor combination. For example, the labor force was not divided into strong and weak groups, there was no division of labor according to technical expertise, no task requirements were put forward according to different labor forces, and there was no division of routes for fertilizer transportation. Therefore, the phenomenon of idling and waste was very serious.

Xiao Chunzhen, the party secretary of Maojiatan Township, after discovering this phenomenon in the Heshang Cooperative, convened a meeting of cadres above the production team leader level in the entire cooperative to study ways to overcome this phenomenon. The attendees calculated the three accounts of spring ploughing production tasks, time, and labor, and realized that improving labor efficiency was one of the important ways to solve the problem of insufficient labor. They also criticized the cadres' practice of loving excitement but not seeking work efficiency. After the meeting, the entire cooperative's labor force was divided into 84 groups. In addition to 14 shock teams for turning compost pits and 14 teams using cattle, each team had one. The remaining labor force was organized into elderly general groups, prime-age steel groups, youth shock groups, women's hero groups, young pioneer groups, and cooperative-loving grandma groups according to different situations. After the labor groups were divided, the team assigned tasks to each group and each person, and specified the fertilizer transportation routes. Each group's work area was marked with a flag. In this way, the labor of the 14 production teams was carried out in an orderly manner, truly achieving a rational division of labor, each doing their best, and giving full play to their strengths. The overall labor efficiency of the cooperative was thus significantly improved. Previously, each laborer averaged 37 loads of fertilizer per day; now it has increased to 71 loads. Previously, each laborer averaged only eight cubic meters of compost pits per day; now it has increased to 17 cubic meters. Due to the large overfulfillment of the labor quota, working hours have also been shortened. Now, members of each group start work at 5:30 in the morning and stop work at 7:30 in the afternoon, shortening the working hours by two hours compared to the original.

The Heyi Cooperative in Shashi Township, Liuyang County, rationally organized and utilized labor, and the efficiency of accumulating fertilizer jumped from 70 loads per person per day to 147 loads, an increase of more than one time.

This agricultural cooperative organized four types of groups. One is a professional group, with division of labor according to the laborers' special skills. For example, when digging pond mud, it used to be self-digging, self-loading, and self-carrying. Some women who couldn't carry burdens well couldn't complete the task well. Now, after organizing three professional groups for digging soil, loading soil, and carrying soil, the average work efficiency has been greatly improved. The second is a bachelor group, organized to eat together uniformly to avoid delaying work by cooking their own meals. After eating together uniformly, the efficiency of six bachelors carrying pond mud increased from 80 loads per day to 160 loads. The third is a fertilizer-finding group, which finds fertilizer sources in advance and arranges the labor force for accumulating fertilizer. In this way, after the fertilizer source in one place is accumulated, the labor force can be quickly arranged to a new place, avoiding work stoppage and idling. The fourth is a publicity and mobilization group. The members of the publicity and mobilization group participate in labor, pay attention to collecting model deeds and discovering problems, and use various forms to criticize and praise at any time and any place, greatly inspiring the members' enthusiasm for labor.

This agricultural cooperative also pays great attention to improving the labor combination on the construction site, so that the labor force can give full play to its role. For example, when digging pond mud, more than 460 people used to squeeze in two places, hindering each other and wasting a lot of time. Now, four more fertilizer accumulation sites have been added, eliminating the phenomenon of hindering each other and delaying work, so that the efficiency of carrying pond mud has increased from 90 loads per person per day to 170 loads.

    劳动合理分工　工效提高一倍
    湖南两农业社突破春耕劳动力不足的难关
    本报讯　新湖南报消息：为了克服在农业生产大跃进中，特别在当前繁忙的春耕季节中劳动力不足的困难，湖南省两个农业生产合作社合理改善劳动组织和加强劳动管理，大大提高了劳动工效。
    汉寿县毛家滩乡和平社通过改善劳动组织，每个劳力每天劳动工时缩短了二小时，工效提高了一倍。
    和平社今年在大跃进的形势下，社员们劲头很高，每天都是四点半钟出工，晚上八、九点钟才收工，出动人数经常在七百人左右。真是“出工一大片，大路连一线”，一天到晚，广播、锣鼓、吆喝声闹得热火朝天。但是，全社各个生产队劳动工效并不高。例如第十二生产队有八十三个劳动力出工，积肥的三十一人，平均工效每天只有三十七担；运肥的三十五人，在一里路的运距内平均工效每天只达二十七担；十一个人翻氹每天平均工效也不过八方；翻田的工效也同样很低。劳动工效低的原因主要是在劳动力组合上有很多问题。如劳动力没有分强弱划组，没有根据技术特长分工，没有按不同劳动力提出任务要求，运肥没有分路走。因此，窝工浪费的现象很严重。
    毛家滩乡的党委书记萧春珍，在和平社发现这种现象以后，召开全社生产队长以上干部的会议，研究克服这种现象的办法。到会的人算了春耕生产任务、时间、劳力三笔账，认识到提高劳动工效是解决劳动力不足的问题的重要出路之一，并且批判了干部中爱讲热闹不求工效的作法。会后，全社劳动力即分成八十四个小组，其中除十四个翻氹突击组和十四个用牛组各队一个外，其余的劳动力分别不同情况组织了老年将军组、壮年钢铁组、青年突击组、妇女英雄组、少年先锋组、爱社婆婆组等。劳动小组划分后，由队按组按人分配任务，并具体规定了运肥路线，每个小组工作的地段都有旗帜作标志。这样，十四个生产队的劳动进行得有条不紊，真正做到了合理分工，各尽所能，发挥所长，全社劳动工效因而显著提高。以前每个劳动力平均每天积肥三十七担；现在增加到七十一担；以前每个劳力平均每天翻氹只有八方，现在提高到十七方。由于大大超额完成了劳动定额，工作时间也有条件缩短了。现在各组社员上午五点半出工，下午七点半收工，比原来的工时缩短二小时。
    浏阳县沙市乡合义社合理组织和利用劳动力，积肥工效由每人每天七十担飞跃到一百四十七担，增加了一倍多。
    这个农业社组织了四种组。一是专业组，按照劳动力特长分工。比如挑塘泥，以前是自挖自上自挑，有些不会挑担的妇女就不能很好地完成任务；现在组织了挖土、上土、挑土三种专业组后，平均工效就大为提高。二是单身汉组，组织起来统一开伙，免得各自弄饭误工。统一开伙后，六个单身汉挑塘泥的工效每天由八十担提高到一百六十担。三是找肥组，预先找好肥源和作好积肥劳动力的安排。这样，在一处地方的肥源积完后，能够迅速把劳动力安排到新的地方，不会停工窝工。四是宣传鼓动组。宣传鼓动组的组员参加劳动，注意搜集模范事迹和发现问题，随时随地运用各种形式进行批评表扬，大大鼓舞了社员们的劳动积极性。
    这个农业社还非常注意改善工地劳动组合，使劳动力能够充分发挥作用。如挖塘泥，以前是四百六十多人挤在两个地方，互相妨碍，浪费了好多时间。现在增加了四个积肥工地，消灭了互相妨碍而误工的现象，使挑塘泥的工效由每人每天九十担提高到一百七十担。（附图片）
