Thousands of Mountains and Rivers, Everywhere is the Sunny Road
New Look of Transportation in Mountainous Areas of Fujian and Shaanxi in Five Years

    (By our correspondent) Fuzhou – The Fujian Provincial Department of Transportation recently proposed an ambitious plan for the development of transportation in mountainous areas for the second and third Five-Year Plans.

    The overall goal proposed in the plan is to have all sixty-seven counties (cities) in the province accessible by roads by 1959. Starting from 1958, within five years, eighteen main roads with a total length of 1,080 kilometers will be built, along with 4,275 kilometers of simple roads and 7,000 kilometers of roads for human and animal-powered vehicles. The aim is to ensure that important forestry areas, grain-producing areas, state-owned farms, major industrial and mining areas, important railway stations, ports and docks, and major economic towns are accessible by roads. Within ten years, simple roads should be available to some agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas, and most rural communities should have roads suitable for local transportation. After the second Five-Year Plan is completed, the mileage of roads in Fujian will increase by more than 86% compared to the present, and the density of the road network will increase by nearly double.

    In terms of inland water transport, the plan stipulates that waterways and rivers should be dredged based on the principles of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and urgent need. Starting from 1958, it is required to dredge 1,667 kilometers of waterways and rivers within five years, and within ten years, most rivers and streams should be navigable by bamboo rafts and wooden sailboats. Existing ports and equipment should also be upgraded and improved, while extending the mileage of steamer routes and gradually developing shallow-water tugboats. It is expected that after the second Five-Year Plan is implemented, the isolation of mountainous areas in Fujian will be changed.

    (By our correspondent) Xi'an – The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Transportation recently formulated a Great Leap Forward plan for transportation. During the second Five-Year Plan period, the province plans to build more than 20,500 kilometers of roads, of which, except for more than 2,800 kilometers of roads, all kinds of folk transportation roads are built by the masses relying on local strength. Most of these roads are in mountainous areas. Rivers throughout the province will also be vigorously renovated.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Transportation has decided that during the second Five-Year Plan period, in addition to building the Xi'an-Wanyuan and Zhouzhi-Foping-Yangxian trunk roads across the Qinling and Daba Mountains, a large number of simple roads will be built between counties and counties, counties and major economic zones, and industrial zones, as well as footpaths, pack animal trails, and pushcart roads suitable for local folk transportation tools. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan period, Shaanxi Province will have a crisscrossing road network with trunk roads as the mainstay, connecting many short-distance simple roads extending to the vast mountainous areas and various folk roads. With the exception of a very small number of counties and districts, most counties, districts, towns, and villages can be accessed by cars and pushcarts.

    After vigorous development during the second Five-Year Plan period, wooden sailboats will be able to pass unimpeded on many small rivers and tributaries in Shaanxi. After renovation, mainstream rivers such as the Han River can be navigated by motorized vessels.

    关山千万重　处处阳关道
    福建陕西山区交通五年呈现新面貌
    本报讯　福建省交通厅最近提出了宏伟的第二个五年和第三个五年内的山区交通建设规划。
    规划中提出的今后建设总目标是，1959年内全省六十七县（市）县县通公路。从1958年起，五年内要修建干线公路十八条，全长一千零八十公里，修建简易公路四千二百七十五公里，人力、兽力车道七千公里，基本上做到重要森林区、产粮区、国营农场、主要工矿区、重要铁路车站、港口码头和主要经济城镇都通公路。十年内做到山区部分农业合作社有简易公路，大多数乡社之间有适合当地运输工具的道路。第二个五年计划实现后，福建公路通车里程将比现在增加86％以上，公路网的密度将比现在增加近一倍。
    在内河航运方面，规划中规定：根据简易、省钱、急需的原则，疏浚航道、河道。从1958年起，要求五年内疏浚航道河道一千六百六十七公里，并要求十年内，大部分河道、溪流都能通行竹筏和木帆船。已有的港口和设备也要提高和改善，同时要延长轮船航道里程，逐步发展浅水拖轮。可以预期，第二个五年计划实现以后，福建山关闭塞的现象将会改变。
    本报讯　陕西省交通运输部门最近订出了交通运输大跃进计划。在第二个五年计划期间，全省计划修建道路二万零五百多公里，其中除二千八百多公里路以外，都是依靠各地群众力量修筑的各种民间运输道路。这些道路大部分在山区。全省河道也要大力整修。
    陕西省交通部门决定在第二个五年计划期间，除了修建横贯秦岭和大巴山的西（安）万（源）和盩（厔）佛（坪）洋（县）两条干线外，将大量修建县与县、县与主要经济区、工业区的简易公路，以及适合各地民间运输工具的人行道、驮马道、架子车道等。到第二个五年计划期末，陕西省将出现以干线公路为主，连接许多伸向广大山区的短途简易公路和各种民间道路的纵横交错的道路网。除极个别的县、区外，绝大部分的县、区、镇、乡都可以通行汽车和架子车。
    经过第二个五年计划期间的大力开发，陕西许多小河、支流上，木帆船将可畅通无阻。汉江等主流经过整治，可以通行机动船舶。
