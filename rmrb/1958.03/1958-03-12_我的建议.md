My Suggestions

    Save Telephones
    I saw that in a CCP county committee, seven departments, offices, and commissions had installed seven telephones. Their offices were neighbors, and their telephone usage was not high. Reducing two or three telephones would be entirely possible. After the first secretary of this county committee was transferred and lived next door to another secretary, this comrade personally made a hole in the dividing wall, saving one telephone, and saving sixty-six yuan in telephone rental per year. I suggest that all agencies and organizations pay attention to saving telephones.
    I also suggest that everyone use less good-quality paper envelopes and more waste newspaper envelopes. In the past, in the Liberated Areas, one envelope was used several times, which is still worth promoting.

    Improve Paper Size to Save Paper
    Currently, the paper used by various agencies and organizations for writing and mimeographing is 26 centimeters long and 18 centimeters wide. When cutting rough-edged paper or improved paper this way, there are always leftover paper scraps. The raw materials from the scraps cut from every six sheets of rough-edged paper or improved paper could be used to make one more sheet of paper. I hope that paper mills will study this to save industrial raw materials.

    Utilize Torn-off Calendar Paper
    Most people crumple up torn-off calendar pages and throw them into the wastepaper basket. If everyone used them as small notes, a lot of paper could be saved.

    我的建议
    节约电话机
    我看到在一个中共县委会里，七个部、室、委安装了七部电话，他们的办公室都是邻居，他们的电话使用也不多，减少两三部电话是完全可以的。这个县委的第一书记调来后，住在另一个书记的隔壁，这个同志亲自动手在隔墙上掏了一个洞，就省去一部电话，一年就节省六十六元电话机租金。我建议各机关团体注意节约电话机。
    我还建议大家少用好纸信封，多用废报纸糊信封。过去解放区一个信封用好几次，还是值得提倡。

    改良纸幅节约纸张
    目前各机关团体缮写油印用纸，都是二十六公分长、十八公分宽，这样裁毛边纸或改良纸，总要剩余碎纸条；每六张毛边纸或改良纸裁下的碎纸条的原料，又可以多制造一张纸。希望造纸厂加以研究，节约工业原料。

    利用撕下的日历纸
    一般人都是把扯下来的日历，揉成一团丢到字纸篓去。如果大家都把它用来作小纸条用，可以节约很多纸。
