The Soviet Union's Nationwide Discussion

By our correspondents Chen Quanbi and Dai Feng

The nationwide discussion in the Soviet Union on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations has been going on for nearly a month. The discussion is now entering its final stage, and the party and government of each republic have summarized the issues raised in the discussions and are preparing to submit them to the Supreme Soviet meeting to be held on March 27 for final discussion. This nationwide discussion is another one, following last year's discussion on the reorganization of industrial management. The discussion fully demonstrated the tremendous surge in the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of the Soviet people.

This nationwide discussion revolves around the resolution "On Further Developing the Collective Farm System and Reorganizing Machine Tractor Stations" passed by the February Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. Participants include the broad masses of collective farm members, state farm workers, workers, scientists, economists, military personnel, party, and Soviet cadres. There was great enthusiasm in the discussions. For example, as of March 20, the number of people participating in discussion meetings in the Ukrainian Republic reached 7.65 million, with 450,000 speaking at the meetings. In the Moscow region, more than one million people participated in the discussion, with more than 40,000 speakers. Newspapers and periodicals across the country have opened special pages for the general public to express their opinions. "Pravda" receives more than 400 letters from readers every day on this issue. In the nationwide discussion, the broad masses of the Soviet people put forward many creative suggestions and unanimously expressed their full support for the wise decision of the CPSU Central Committee.

In this nationwide discussion, the most frequently expressed opinions can be summarized into the following issues: the possible conditions for the reorganization of tractor stations and the significance of the reorganization; how the state sells tractors to collective farms; the relationship between ownership by the whole people and collective farm ownership; how to reorganize tractor stations into technical repair stations; how to rationally use the technical personnel of tractor stations; who will lead collective farm production after the reorganization of tractor stations; and how agricultural machinery manufacturing plants will specifically improve the supply of agricultural machinery in the future.

In the widespread and in-depth nationwide discussion, in addition to unanimously supporting the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and expressing gratitude to the Party and government for their deep concern for collective farmers, people unanimously believed that the machine tractor stations, which have been established for 30 years, have completed their glorious historical mission. Today, under the requirements of further developing the collective farm system and accelerating the improvement of agricultural production, tractor stations can no longer meet the requirements of highly developed agricultural production. On the contrary, in many respects, they are hindering the development of agricultural production. Many examples cited in the discussion illustrate this point. For example, the efficiency of tractor plowing at the Krasnoufim Tractor Station in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast is almost half that of the tractors at the nearby "Red Army Fighter" State Farm; and what about the harvest? The state farm yields 18.2 quintals per hectare, while the farms served by this tractor station only yield 12 quintals. Why do the same land and the same tractors produce different results? The reason is that the former closely integrates production tools and labor, while the latter, because machines and technical equipment are concentrated in tractor stations, collective farms themselves cannot directly control and use these machines. Although the production goals of the farm and the tractor station are consistent, they are managed separately, each with its own system, and production is uncoordinated, which of course affects production and hinders the development of farm productivity.

In the past, the farms cultivated by tractor stations have been supplying the state with inexpensive agricultural products and industrial raw materials. But in recent years, because tractor stations and farms maintain two increasingly large institutions, this has increased the cost of agricultural products. For example, in 1956, the cost of each quintal of grain on state farms was 33 rubles, while the cost on collective farms was twice as high.

This uneconomical and unreasonable phenomenon of having two masters on one piece of land seriously affects the leap-forward development of agricultural production. Especially in recent years, when agricultural production has developed rapidly, people have felt this more and more deeply. Therefore, advanced farms in Ukraine, Kuban, and other places have long begun to seek new forms of improving the relationship between the two. For example, the "Road to Communism" Collective Farm in Vladimir Oblast merged the tractor work team and the farm field production team in 1957, and unified leadership was provided by the farm. A year of experimentation proved that this approach was beneficial to the farm and to the country. The farm's production enthusiasm was increased, and the potential of the machines was fully exploited. For example, a 15-horsepower tractor could previously plow only 398 hectares of land, but after the merger, it increased to 475 hectares. The cost of cultivating one hectare of land was previously 22 rubles and 87 kopecks, but after the merger, it was only 14 rubles and 85 kopecks. Due to intensive cultivation, the farm's harvest also increased greatly, enabling the country to obtain more various agricultural products. Similar practical experience has also been gained in Kuban, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Stavropol, and other places.

Do collective farms at the present stage already have the ability to purchase tractors and other agricultural machines for themselves? In the discussion, everyone gave an affirmative answer to this question. For example, the funds retained by farms for public accumulation in 1958 are estimated to reach 25 billion rubles, while the total value of all agricultural machines is 18 billion to 20 billion rubles. The discussion reflected that, according to the specific conditions in various places, collective farms can be roughly divided into three types for purchasing tractors. First, farms with more public accumulation funds can pay in cash and take delivery of the goods; second, farms can pay in installments (within two or three years); third, farms in some areas still feel difficulties, and the conditions for tractor stations to sell machines are not fully mature, so tractor stations must continue to be maintained to help farms cultivate. Although the state has not yet finalized the price of selling tractors, collective farms in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and other republics, as well as in Kuban, Stavropol Krai, and other places, have begun to purchase various agricultural machines from tractor stations, actively preparing for spring plowing. Many collective farms are actively building tractor parking lots and small repair shops, etc.

How to rationally allocate the large number of technical cadres of tractor stations is also one of the important issues in the discussion. Currently, there are 8,000 tractor stations in the Soviet Union, with a total of 186,000 station directors and engineers, and 1.5 million technicians. Except for tractor stations in some areas that must continue to be retained, most tractor stations will undergo thorough reorganization. In the speeches, people unanimously believed that this group of skilled technical cadres must be rationally allocated. Roughly, they should be allocated in three places. Some will remain in technical repair stations, some will be assigned to the agricultural technology sections of district soviets to serve as cadres leading farm production, and most technical personnel will be stationed in farms. In the discussion, people believed that the most outstanding technical cadres must first be assigned to collective farms that are experiencing more production difficulties and are backward, to specifically help them organize and lead production. Now, collective farms in many areas have begun to actively prepare to welcome new production forces. For example, the "Road to Communism" Collective Farm in the Dubossary District of the Moldavian Republic has allocated 200,000 rubles to build houses, preparing to welcome new people.

Regarding how to reorganize machine tractor stations into technical repair stations, the decision of the February Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out that after selling their tractors and other agricultural machines, tractor stations must be reorganized into technical repair stations, specializing in repairing agricultural machines, and at the same time, through sales, the repair stations are responsible for supplying farms with new technical equipment. On this issue, people have put forward many suggestions in the discussion. Some people believe that in order to be able to inspect and repair machines at any time, each farm itself must establish a small repair shop. Others believe that it is more appropriate for two or three farms to jointly build a technical repair shop. The third opinion is that in addition to establishing repair shops between farms, some large district-level technical repair stations must be established.

Who will specifically lead collective farm production after the reorganization of tractor stations is also one of the issues discussed this time. In the past, tractor stations were not only the organizers of farm production but also the leaders of political work. After the abolition of tractor stations, technical repair stations cannot undertake this task. In the discussion, some people believed that collective farms now have rich leadership experience and strong technical forces and are already in a position to independently organize production. Local party organizations and soviets only need to make general plans and supervise. This opinion was opposed by many people. They believe that after the reorganization of tractor stations, local soviets must become an important link in leading collective farm production.

All Soviet collective farmers and tractor station workers are awaiting the final conclusion of the first session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 27. Undoubtedly, this reorganization of tractor stations will bring a great leap forward in Soviet agriculture. Because the close integration of infinitely active labor and advanced technology will surely open up a broad road for the production potential of collective farms and the production enthusiasm of farmers. Now, collective farm members across the Soviet Union are putting forward this year's production plans to welcome the great leap forward in agriculture.

    苏联的全民大讨论
    本报记者　陈泉璧　戴枫
    苏联进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的全民讨论，进行了将近一个月了。现在讨论已进入最后阶段，各共和国的党和政府总结了各地讨论中提出的问题，准备提交给3月27日召开的最高苏维埃会议作最后讨论。这次全民讨论是继去年关于改组工业管理的讨论后的又一次全民大讨论。讨论中充分表现出了苏联广大人民政治热情的巨大高涨。
    这次全民性讨论是围绕着苏共中央二月全会所通过的“进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站”的决议进行的。参加讨论的有广大集体农庄庄员、国营农场工作人员、工人、科学家、经济学家、部队、党和苏维埃干部。讨论中发言非常踊跃。例如到3月20日止，乌克兰共和国参加讨论会的人数达七百六十五万之多，在会上发言的达四十五万人。莫斯科州参加讨论的也达一百多万人，发言者达四万多人。全国各地报刊都开辟了专页供广大群众发表意见。“真理报”每天接到四百多封读者关于这个问题的来信。广大的苏联人民在大讨论中提出了许多创造性的建议，一致表示了全力支持苏共中央的英明决定。
    这次全民讨论中，人们发表意见最多的，概括起来大致有下列这几个问题：拖拉机站改组的可能条件与改组的意义；国家怎样把拖拉机卖给集体农庄；全民所有制和集体农庄所有制之间的关系；怎样把拖拉机站改组成技术修理站；拖拉机站的技术人员应怎样合理地使用；拖拉机站改组后，集体农庄生产由谁来领导；以及农业机器制造厂今后怎样具体地作好农业机器的供应问题等。
    在普遍深入的全民讨论中，人们除一致拥护苏共中央的决议及感谢党和政府对集体农民的深切关怀外，一致认为建立了三十年之久的机器拖拉机站已经完成了它光荣的历史使命。今天，在进一步发展集体农庄制度和加速提高农业生产的要求下，拖拉机站已经不能适应高度发展农业生产的要求。相反地，在农庄生产力的发展上，在许多方面却起着阻碍的作用。讨论中列举出的许多实例说明了这一点。例如，第聂伯彼特罗夫斯克州的克拉斯诺乌费姆拖拉机站，拖拉机耕地的效率几乎比附近“红军战士”国营农场的拖拉机相差一半；而收获量呢？国营农场每一公顷土地收十八点二公担，而这个拖拉机站所服务的农庄只收了十二公担。为什么一样的土地，一样的拖拉机得出了两样的结果呢？原因是前者生产工具与劳动力紧密结合，而后者因为机器和技术设备都集中在拖拉机站里，集体农庄本身无法直接支配和使用这些机器。虽然农庄与拖拉机站的生产目的是一致的，但他们分散经营，各有系统，生产上互不协调，这样当然就会影响生产，阻碍农庄生产力的发展。
    过去，拖拉机站所耕作的农庄一直是供应国家廉价的农产品和工业原料的。但近年来，由于拖拉机站和农庄经济维持着两个开支日益增大的机构，这就使得农产品的成本提高了。如1956年国营农场每公担粮食成本为三十三卢布，而集体农庄成本要高出一倍。
    这种一块土地上有两个主人的不经济、不合理的现象，严重地影响着农业生产的飞跃发展。特别是近年来，当农业生产发展很快的情况下，人们越来越深切地感到了这一点。因此，在乌克兰、库班等地先进的农庄早已开始寻觅改进两者关系的新形式。如弗拉奇米尔州的“共产主义道路”集体农庄，在1957年把拖拉机工作队和农庄田间生产队合并了起来，统一由农庄领导。一年的试验结果证明，这种作法有利于农庄，也有利于国家。农庄生产积极性提高了，机器潜力也充分发挥了。如一台十五马力的拖拉机以前只能翻耕三百九十八公顷土地，合并后，增为四百七十五公顷。以前一公顷土地耕作成本为二十二卢布八十七戈比，合并后只有十四卢布八十五戈比。由于精耕细作，农庄收获量也大大增加，使国家得到了更多的各种农产品。在库班、乌兹别克斯坦、哈萨克斯坦、斯塔甫罗波尔等地也同样获得了这种实际经验。
    集体农庄在现阶段是否已经具备了为自己购置拖拉机和其他农业机器的能力呢？讨论中，大家给予这个问题的回答是肯定的。例如1958年农庄留作公积金的款项，估计达二百五十亿卢布，而目前所有的农业机器总值一百八十亿到二百亿卢布。讨论中反映出，根据目前各地具体情况，集体农庄购买拖拉机大体上可分为三种类型。第一类，农庄公积金比较多，可以一手交钱，一手取货；第二类，农庄可分期（两三年内）付款；第三类，部分地区农庄尚感困难，拖拉机站出售机器的条件没有完全成熟，所以必须继续保持拖拉机站，帮助农庄耕作。目前虽然国家还没有最后规定出售拖拉机的价格，但在乌克兰、哈萨克、乌兹别克、土库曼、塔吉克等共和国和库班、斯塔甫罗波尔边疆区等地的广大集体农庄，已经开始向拖拉机站购买各种农业机器，积极准备春耕。许多集体农庄已在积极建造拖拉机停放场和小修理所等等。
    怎样合理地分配拖拉机站的大批技术干部，也是讨论中的重要问题之一。目前，全苏有八千个拖拉机站，共有十八万六千名站长和工程师，还有一百五十万名技师。除部分地区的拖拉机站必须继续保留外，绝大部分拖拉机站将进行彻底的改组。发言中人们一致地认为这批技术熟练的干部必须合理分配。大体上要分配在三个地方。一部分将仍留在技术修理站，一部分将分配到区苏维埃农业技术科充当领导农庄生产的干部，而大部分技术人员将固定在农庄工作。讨论中，人们认为必须将最优秀的技术干部首先分配到那些生产较为困难和落后的集体农庄去，具体地帮助他们组织和领导生产。现在，许多地区的集体农庄，已开始积极准备迎接新的生产力量。例如，摩尔达维亚共和国杜巴萨尔区“共产主义之路”集体农庄已拨了二十万卢布建造住房，准备迎接新人。
    关于怎样把机器拖拉机站改组成技术修理站的问题，苏共中央二月全会决定中指出：拖拉机站在出售了自己的拖拉机和其他农业机器后，必须改组为技术修理站，专门修理农业机器，同时，通过出售的办法，修理站负有供应农庄新的技术装备的责任。在这一问题上，人们在讨论中提出了不少的建议。有些人认为，为了随时能检修机器，每个农庄本身必须建立小型修理所。也有人认为，两三个农庄合建一个技术修理所较适宜。第三种意见认为，除了建立农庄之间的修理所之外，必须建立一些大型的区一级的技术修理站。
    拖拉机站改组之后，集体农庄生产由谁来具体领导，也是这次讨论的问题之一。以前，拖拉机站不仅是农庄生产的组织者，也是政治工作的领导者。拖拉机站取消后，技术修理站不可能担负起这一任务。讨论中，有人认为：现在集体农庄领导经验已很丰富，技术力量也很雄厚，已经具备了独立地组织生产的条件。地方党组织和苏维埃只要作一般的计划和监督就可以了。这个意见受到许多人的反对。他们认为，拖拉机站改组后，地方苏维埃必须成为领导集体农庄生产的重要环节。
    全苏集体农民和拖拉机站的工作人员，正在等待着3月27日苏联最高苏维埃第一次会议的最后结论。无疑地，这次拖拉机站的改组，将会使苏联农业来一个大跃进。因为无限活跃的劳动力与先进技术的密切结合，必为集体农庄的生产潜力和农民生产的积极性开辟宽广的道路。现在全苏联集体农庄庄员们正纷纷提出今年的生产计划，来迎接农业的大跃进。
