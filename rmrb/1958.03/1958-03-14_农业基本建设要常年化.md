Agricultural Infrastructure Construction Should Be Regularized
    By our commentator
    At the start of spring plowing, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province organized a total of 500,000 farmers into agricultural infrastructure construction teams, tasked with putting basic construction projects such as farmland irrigation and water and soil conservation on a regular construction schedule. This is an excellent measure.
    Specialized infrastructure construction teams focused on year-round irrigation and water and soil conservation already appeared last year in Sichuan and parts of other provinces. At that time, these specialized construction teams were few in number, but their positive impact was already evident. They can combine the large-scale infrastructure construction carried out intensively in the winter and spring seasons with year-round infrastructure construction, and combine current agricultural production with year-round infrastructure construction.
    In the past, every year before winter and spring plowing, agricultural cooperatives in various places had to carry out large-scale farmland irrigation and water and soil conservation and other basic construction; however, once spring plowing arrived, the entire workforce shifted to spring plowing production. Some irrigation projects that were left unfinished were wasted, left there in vain, and could not produce benefits in the current year. There are also some water conservancy projects and soil and water conservation projects, due to the lack of a full-time engineering management organization, after the spring plowing, everyone only cared about the intense production, no one was responsible for management and maintenance, and some projects broke a little, not repaired in time, resulting in the entire project being destroyed by mountain floods during a flash flood, wasting a winter of effort. In order to avoid the above losses, under the condition of not affecting the current production, allocating a small number of laborers to form a professional infrastructure construction team can continue construction, complete this part of the project in time, so that the cooperative can use this part of the project in the current year's production to increase revenue. At the same time, the professional infrastructure construction team can also be responsible for the management and maintenance of completed projects, and plan to build some new projects. This approach is beneficial to both agricultural production and agricultural construction.
    Organizing infrastructure construction teams for year-round construction is also a good way to train technical personnel. Because the infrastructure construction team is specialized, the members have time to study and research water conservancy technology and improve their technical level. Once winter arrives, they become the technical backbone in large-scale construction, capable of undertaking the survey and design of small projects, and can also guide construction.
    Organizing a professional infrastructure construction team does not necessarily increase the economic burden of the cooperative. In 1957, the Mengwang Agricultural Cooperative in Jia County, Henan Province, had six reservoirs, managed by a professional infrastructure construction team of 37 people. They reasonably divided the work, taking turns on duty at the reservoir during the flood season, and usually inspecting and repairing the reservoir and irrigation canals. At the same time, on the premise of doing a good job in water discharge for irrigation and soil and water conservation, they also carried out agricultural and sideline production near the reservoir, opening up wasteland for farming and harvesting more than 7,000 catties of grain, raising 20,000 fish, feeding two pigs, two cattle, and seventeen chickens in a year. They also plan to plant fruit trees and create windbreaks near the reservoir, to achieve complete self-sufficiency within two years. In this way, they have actually become the vanguard team for the cooperative to develop mountain production.
    Year-round infrastructure construction teams are still a new thing for the time being, and there is not much experience in various places. Many specific issues such as its organizational form, relationship with townships and cooperatives, work focus, and labor remuneration of team members need to be resolved and summarized in practice by various places according to the specific situation.

    农业基本建设要常年化
    本报评论员
    四川省各地的农业合作社在春耕开始之际，总共组织了有五十万农民参加的农业基本建设队伍，他们的任务是把农田水利和水土保持等基本建设纳入了常年施工的轨道。这是一个很好的措施。
    以常年兴修水利和水土保持为专业的基本建设队，去年在四川和别的省的部分地区就已经出现。那时这种专业建设队为数还很少，但是它们的积极作用已经明显地看出来了，它可以把冬春季节突击进行的大规模的基本建设和常年的基本建设结合起来，把当前农业生产和常年基本建设结合起来。
    过去，每年冬季和春耕前，各地农业合作社都要大规模地进行农田水利和水土保持等基本建设；但是，春耕一到，就全班人马一齐转入春耕生产，一些留下了尾巴的水利工程，就功亏一篑，白白放在那里，不能在当年生产上发挥效益。还有一些水利工程和水土保持工程，由于没有建立专职的工程管理组织，春耕以后，大家只顾紧张地生产，无人负责管理和养护，有的工程坏了一点，不及时修补，结果山洪暴发时整个工程被冲毁，白白浪费了一冬力气。为了避免以上的损失，在不影响当前生产的条件下，拨出少数劳动力组成专业基本建设队，就可以接着施工，及时完成这部分工程，使合作社把这部分工程用在当年生产上，增加收益。同时，专业基本建设队还可以负责已完工程的管理维护工作，和有计划地兴建一部分新的工程。这种作法，对农业生产和农业建设都有好处。
    组织基本建设队常年施工，也是培养技术人才的好办法。因为基本建设队既是专业性质的，队员就有时间学习和钻研水利技术，提高技术水平。冬季一到，他们就成了大规模建设中的技术骨干，能胜任地担负起小型工程的勘测设计工作，又能指导施工。
    组织专业的基本建设队，不一定要增加合作社的经济负担。河南省郏县冡王农业合作社1957年有六座水库，由三十七人组成的专业基本建设队管理。他们合理分工，汛期轮流在水库上值班，平常对于水库和灌溉渠进行检查、修理，同时在做好放水浇地、水土保持等工作的前提下，又在水库附近开展农业和副业生产，一年之中开荒种地收粮七千多斤，养鱼两万尾，喂猪两口、牛两头、鸡十七只。他们还计划在水库附近栽植果树，营造防风林，两年内做到完全自给。这样，他们实际上成了合作社发展山区生产的先遣队。
    常年基本建设队目前来说还是个新东西，各地的经验还不多。它的组织形式，与乡、社的关系，工作重点，队员劳动报酬等许多具体问题都需要各地在实践中按照具体情况解决，并总结经验。
