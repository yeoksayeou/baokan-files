Agricultural High Yield Record

    Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative
    Sorghum Yields Exceptionally High
    In 1957, the Dongsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Wanggezhuang Township, Funing County, Hebei Province, planted 1,993 mu of sorghum, with an average yield of 734 jin per mu. Among them, 128.4 mu yielded over 1,000 jin per mu, and 33.118 mu of irrigated land averaged 1,302 jin per mu.

    This cooperative is located at the foot of the Great Wall, by the Bohai Sea, with a frost-free period of over 180 days. It is often threatened by spring droughts, autumn floods, and wind damage, so natural conditions are not good.

    The variety they used was multi-spike sorghum. They applied over 5,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu and applied 10 to 20 jin of chemical fertilizer during the tillering and heading stages. They also paid attention to deep plowing to preserve soil moisture and timely, meticulous sowing.

    东升农业社
    高粱产量特别高
    河北省抚宁县王各庄乡东升农业社1957年种植高粱一千九百九十三亩，平均亩产七百三十四斤；其中一百二十八亩四分，亩产千斤以上；水浇地三十三亩一分八厘，平均亩产达到一千三百零二斤。
    这个社位于长城下渤海边，无霜期一百八十多天，常有春旱秋涝和风害的威胁，自然条件是不够好的。
    他们采用的品种是多穗高粱；每亩施底肥五千多斤，在开始分蘖和孕穗期各施化肥十到二十斤；还注意了深耕保墒，适时精细播种。
