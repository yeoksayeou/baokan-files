Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: A United Press dispatch from London by reporter Daler on March 15th stated that Britain and Commonwealth countries are studying a plan to strengthen economic ties among Commonwealth nations to cope with the threat of economic recession.

Daler said that Commonwealth countries are concerned that economic recession will cause problems of commodity surpluses. Canada is worried about its wheat, New Zealand and Australia about their dairy products, and other countries about their copper, tin, or other raw materials. The reporter said that Commonwealth countries intend to make arrangements in advance to deal with these commodity surplus problems. The central content of the plan under study is to increase trade between Commonwealth countries and expand the scope of commodity exchange. However, experts point out that Commonwealth countries still need to overcome considerable difficulties and contradictions to realize this type of plan.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Ottawa News: The phenomenon of economic recession in Canada has become increasingly apparent.

According to Canadian press reports, many industrial sectors in Canada have been continuously cutting production since the middle of last year. By December of last year, steel production had decreased by 23% compared to the same period of the previous year, and iron production had decreased by 21%. The operating rate of the national oil industry has recently only reached 50% to 60%.

The number of unemployed people in Canada at the beginning of this year has reached more than 700,000. According to trade union estimates, by March of this year, the number of unemployed people may exceed one million, accounting for about 20% of the total number of workers in the country.

Many political figures and newspapers in Canada are calling on the government to take emergency measures to deal with the recession and reduce unemployment. They also point out that Canada's economic recession is closely related to the US economic recession and is largely a reflection of the US situation because 74% of Canada's imports come from the United States and 60% of its exports are to the United States. They also point out that in order to mitigate the impact of the economic recession, Canada should reduce its one-sided dependence on the US economy and expand trade with socialist countries.

    经济衰退威胁英联邦国家
    加拿大工业生产下降失业激增
    新华社16日讯　据合众社记者戴勒15日从伦敦发出的消息说，英国和英联邦国家正在研究一个加强英联邦国家经济关系的计划来应付经济衰退的威胁。
    戴勒说，英联邦国家都担心经济衰退将引起商品过剩问题。加拿大为它的小麦担心，新西兰和澳大利亚为它们的牛奶产品担心，其他国家为它们的铜、锡或其他原料而担心。记者说，英联邦国家打算事先进行安排来对付这些商品的过剩问题。正在研究中的计划的中心内容是要增加联邦国家之间的贸易和扩大商品交换的范围。但是据专家们指出，英联邦国家要实现这一类的计划还必需克服相当多的困难和矛盾。
    据新华社16日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大经济衰退的现象已经越来越明显。
    据加拿大报刊报道，自从去年年中以来，加拿大许多工业部门都不断削减生产。到去年12月，钢产量已经比前年同一时期减少了23％，铁产量减少了21％。全国的石油工业的开工率在最近期内仅达50％至60％。
    加拿大的失业人数在今年年初已高达七十多万人，据工会方面的估计，到今年3月份，失业人数可能超过一百万人，占全国工人总数20％左右。
    加拿大许多政界人士和报纸都在要求政府采取紧急措施来应付衰退和减少失业。他们同时指出，加拿大的经济衰退同美国的经济衰退有着密切关系，并且在很大程度上是美国状况的反映，因为加拿大74％的进口品来自美国，60％的出口品是输往美国的。他们还指出，加拿大要减轻经济衰退的影响，就应当减少对美国经济的片面依赖，并且扩大同社会主义阵营国家的贸易。
