Athletes are Diligently Training

Liu Dayi to Train Hard All Spring
The famous mountaineering athlete and worker of the Lüda Electric Power Bureau, Liu Dayi, started his spring training early.

Liu Dayi participated in the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team that conquered the "Father of Ice Mountains." Last year, he conquered the "King of Mountains," Mount Gongga, domestically. When he climbed Mount Gongga, which is 7,590 meters above sea level, he walked on ice rocks less than one meter wide, climbed steep snow slopes of up to 90 degrees, and experienced attacks and threats from falling rocks, avalanches, blizzards, and lightning. Therefore, he realized that only by intensifying physical training can he create greater honors for China's mountaineering movement. Liu Dayi has been playing basketball all winter to strengthen his physical fitness. Recently, to cultivate the quality of hard work and endurance, he decided to train hard all spring. Despite being busy with work during the Great Leap Forward, he will use four mornings each week to practice running. He also plans to go to Daheishan Mountain, the highest peak in the southern part of the Liaodong Peninsula, for training. (Jin Yuanqing)

Pushing Manure Doesn't Stop Bicycle Training
The female cyclist Chen Qiaozhu is a manure cart worker. Every day, while others are still asleep, she pushes a large manure cart weighing four to five hundred pounds and runs on the road for five to six hours. Her ordinary work has strengthened her arm and leg strength, enabling her to achieve a result of 9 minutes and 19.9 seconds in the women's 5,000-meter cycling race at the national competition in Beijing last April, earning her the title of Master of Sport. Since then, she has become even more passionate about her work and cycling. She often exercises in her spare time. She goes to the Shanghai Fengyu Stadium once a week for indoor training. In addition to practicing speed on stationary bicycle frames, she also participates in activities such as basketball, running, and gymnastics, and has learned how to repair bicycles.

Now, she has started spring training, using her spare time to practice cycling on the road. She is preparing to run 25 kilometers in one go. (Lu Zuohua)

Strive for 10.7 Seconds in the 100 Meters
Although Guangzhou currently does not have any Masters of Sport, athletes have put forward the slogan of advancing towards the Master of Sport title. Li Yuanxin, a student at Zhongshan Medical College and fifth place winner in the men's 100-meter race at the 1958 National Spring Track and Field Meet, is one of them. His best result is 11 seconds, and this year he reached 10.7 seconds under super-wind conditions.

Li Yuanxin only started systematically training for the 100-meter race in 1956, improving his score from 11.7 seconds to 11 seconds. He believes that with another year of training this year, reaching 10.7 seconds is entirely possible.

He plans to increase his training time every day and increase the amount of exercise to build his endurance. (Li Zuoji)

Yunnan Female Athletes Strive to Be the Best
On the Kunming City sports field in Yunnan Province, the athletes of Yunnan Province are going all out and intensifying their training. A few days ago, the Yunnan Women's Basketball Team played a basketball training match against the Yunnan Men's Soccer Team. Although the women's basketball players had planted vegetables for a morning and faced tough opponents, they were all agile and tenacious in the battle.

This women's basketball team with a relatively weak foundation has risen to the ranks of national Class A teams after three years of hard training. Currently, they have proposed a plan for the entire team to strive to reach the top six in the national league within two to three years, and for three to five players to reach the Master of Sport level within five years.

Currently, Zhou Yanling and Li Tingrui, the women's doubles champions of last year's National Tennis League, are undergoing intense and comprehensive training. They are determined to maintain their title of women's doubles champions at this year's National Tennis League in September. (Tian Liangeng)

    运动员们在勤学苦练
    刘大义要苦练一春
    著名爬山运动健将旅大电业局工人刘大义提早开始了春季锻炼。
    刘大义曾经参加中苏混合爬山队征服过“冰山之父”，去年他又在国内征服了“山中之王”贡嘎山。他在攀登拔海七千五百九十公尺的贡嘎山时，曾走过不到一公尺宽的冰岩，爬过陡到九十度的大雪坡，经历过滚石、雪崩、暴风雪、雷电的袭击和威胁。因此，他体会到只有平时加紧锻炼体力，才能为祖国爬山运动创造更大的荣誉。刘大义一冬都在坚持打篮球，增强体力。最近，他为了养成刻苦耐劳的品质，决定苦练一春。尽管在大跃进中工作繁忙，他也要利用每星期的四个早晨练习跑步。他还计划到辽东半岛南部地区最高峰大和尚山进行锻练。　（金原青）
    推粪不忘练自行车
    女子自行车运动健将陈巧珠是个推粪车工人。每天，当别人还在熟睡的时候，她推着四、五百斤重的大粪车，在马路上奔走五、六小时。平凡的工作锻炼了她的臂力和腿力，使她去年4月在北京参加全国比赛时，在女子自行车五千公尺比赛中，取得九分十九秒九的成绩，得到了运动健将称号。从此，她更热爱自己的工作和自行车运动了。她在工作之暇经常地进行锻炼。她每周去上海市风雨操场作一次室内锻炼，除了踏固定的自行车架练习速度以外，还参加篮球、赛跑、体操等活动，并且学会了修理自行车的技术。
    现在，她已开始春季锻炼，利用业余时间到公路上练自行车。她准备作一气跑完二十五公里的练习。

    争取百公尺成绩到十秒七
    广州市目前虽然还没有运动健将，但运动员们都提出了向运动健将进军的口号。中山医学院学生、1958年全国春季田径运动会男子一百公尺跑第五名李元新便是其中的一个。他的最好成绩是十一秒，今年他曾在超风速的情况下，达到十秒七。
    李元新在1956年才开始有计划地锻炼一百公尺跑，成绩由十一秒七提高到十一秒。他认为今年再练一年，达到十秒七是完成有可能的。
    他准备每天增加练习时间，把运动量加大一些，以锻炼自己的耐力。          （黎作骥）
    以云南女运动员力争上游
    在云南省昆明市运动场上，云南省的运动健儿们正鼓足干劲，加紧锻炼。前几日，云南女子篮球队同云南男子足球队进行了一场篮球锻炼比赛。女子篮球队员虽然种了一个上午的蔬菜，又碰到强硬的敌手，但战来个个矫捷顽强。
    这支基础较差的女子篮球队经过三年勤苦锻炼，已跃居全国甲级队的行列。目前，她们又提出全队争取在二、三年内达到全国联赛前六名，五年内争取三个到五个队员达到运动健将级的规划。
    目前，去年全国网球联赛女子双打冠军周延陵和李廷瑞正在进行激烈的、全面的锻炼。她们决心要在今年9月的全国网球联赛中，保持女子双打冠军的称号。（田良耕）

    1958年全国足球甲乙级联赛三月底就要开始了，各队都在积极锻炼，准备参加联赛。这是北京队队员正在练习的情形。
