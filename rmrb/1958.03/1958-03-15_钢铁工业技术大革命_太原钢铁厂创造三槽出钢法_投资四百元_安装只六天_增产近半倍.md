Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 14th. A brand-new steel tapping method in iron and steel production – three-spout steel tapping – was successfully tested twice on March 12th and 13th at Open Hearth Furnace No. 3 of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Open Hearth Steelmaking Department.

The preparation for this experiment began in late February. The test results prove that adopting three-spout steel tapping is a good method for rapidly producing large quantities of steel with little investment and short lead time based on existing equipment. The No. 3 open-hearth furnace used for the experiment originally used double-spout steel tapping, with each furnace producing only 95 tons of steel. During this three-spout steel tapping experiment, the first test produced 122 tons of steel, an increase of 28.4% compared to double-spout steel tapping. The second test produced 135 tons of steel, exceeding the double-spout steel tapping output by 42%. According to the plant's steelmaking department, the construction of a new steel tapping spout only cost 400 yuan, and the design and installation took only six days.

The successful three-spout steel tapping is the first such achievement in China's steelmaking industry. Currently, the advanced steel tapping methods used in the world's steelmaking industry generally still employ two spouts.

The success of the three-spout steel tapping not only greatly increases steel production but also creates a vivid example for future industrial technological reforms. Open Hearth Furnace No. 3 initially produced only 50 tons of steel per furnace. After learning from the double-spout steel tapping experience last year and increasing production to 95 tons, some people thought this achievement was quite good and dared not imagine trying three-spout steel tapping. The success of the three-spout steel tapping changed the views of many engineering and technical personnel who were originally skeptical, and they gave this method high praise.

The success of the three-spout steel tapping also provides the possibility of reducing the frame structure and saving investment for the construction of new steel plants in the future. Because with more steel tapping spouts, smaller overhead cranes for lifting steel ladles can be added, reducing the load-bearing capacity of the plant, and naturally, the plant construction does not require excessively high standards.

Sufficient preparation was made for the three-spout steel tapping experiment, and the smelting work was also improved. In terms of steel tapping operation, the first test was not flexible enough due to lack of experience, and there were shortcomings such as uneven steel distribution and steel overflow at one point. The workers summarized their experience overnight, modified the channel equipment, and completely corrected these shortcomings during the second test. After the steel was tapped, it flowed evenly into the steel ladle along the three channels, fully achieving the expected level, and the quality of the steel ingots also met the standards.

Currently, this factory is actively studying this experiment. The formal adoption of the three-spout steel tapping method in production still requires necessary preparations and the addition of some equipment.

    钢铁工业技术大革命
    太原钢铁厂创造三槽出钢法
    投资四百元　安装只六天　增产近半倍
    新华社太原14日电　钢铁工业生产上的一种最新的出钢方法——三槽出钢，12、13日连续两次在太原钢铁厂平炉炼钢部三号炉试验成功。
    这一试验是2 月下旬开始筹备的。试验结果证明，采取三槽出钢是在原有设备基础上花钱少时间短能够迅速生产大量钢铁的好办法。他们用以试验的三号平炉，原来采用双槽出钢每炉只能出钢九十五吨。这次试验三槽出钢时，第一次试验就出钢一百二十二吨，比双槽出钢的产量增加了28.4％；第二次试验，出钢一百三十五吨，超过双槽出钢量42％。据这个厂的炼钢部统计，他们新建的一个出钢槽只花了四百元的投资，设计和安装仅用了六天的时间。
    三槽出钢在我国炼钢工业方面是第一次试验成功；同时，世界炼钢工业先进的出钢方法目前一般也还是采用两槽出钢。
    三槽出钢试验成功，不但可以大大增加钢的产量，同时也为今后工业的技术改革创造了生动的范例。三号平炉最早每炉只能出钢五十吨。去年学习了双槽出钢经验产量增加到九十五吨以后，有些人就认为这个成就满不错了，根本不敢想像要三槽出钢。三槽出钢试验成功，使许多原来抱怀疑态度的工程技术人员改变了看法，他们给了这种方法以很高的评价。
    三槽出钢试验成功后，还为今后建设新的炼钢厂提供了减轻房架结构、节省投资的可能性。因为出钢槽增多以后，吊运钢包的天车可以多设小型的，厂房负荷力减轻，厂房建设自然就不需要过高的标准。
    三槽出钢试验事先曾作了充分准备，冶炼工作也作了改进。在出钢操作上，第一次试验时由于缺乏经验，操作不够灵敏，钢水分槽时曾一度发生不均衡和钢水外溢等缺点。职工们连夜总结了经验，改装了槽道设备，第二次试验时就完全纠正了这些缺点，钢水出炉后均衡地顺着三个槽道流入钢包，完全达到预计的程度，钢锭质量也合格。
    目前，这个工厂正在积极研究这一试验。三槽出钢的方法正式在生产上采用，还需要进行必要的准备工作和增添一些设备等。
