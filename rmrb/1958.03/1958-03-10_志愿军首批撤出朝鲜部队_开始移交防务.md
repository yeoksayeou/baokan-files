Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 9th: The first group of Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) withdrawing from Korea has begun handing over defense duties to the Korean People's Army (KPA). In recent days, personnel from the handover committees and reception committees at all levels, formed by the first group of CPV withdrawing troops and the KPA receiving troops respectively, have been conducting handover activities in an extremely friendly and cordial atmosphere. Officers and soldiers of the first group of withdrawing CPV troops briefed their KPA comrades on the situation and their experiences, and handed over the position equipment and self-built barracks. CPV officers and soldiers also gratuitously donated many non-military supplies to their KPA comrades, including a large number of self-raised livestock, coal, firewood, grain, vegetables, and horse fodder, as well as various training equipment and cultural entertainment supplies. Many units specially arranged servicemen's clubs for the KPA reception troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 9th: The vast number of officers and soldiers of the first group of CPV troops withdrawing from Korea to return home have been warmly welcoming the advance units of the KPA who have come to take over defense duties in recent days. Before parting, the Chinese and Korean troops held various forums, experience exchange meetings, and get-togethers, learning from each other and congratulating each other.

Some units lined up and waited, even staying up all night, at the road junctions several hours before the KPA receiving troops arrived. As soon as the KPA receiving troops arrived, welcoming slogans and the sound of gongs and drums immediately rang out, and the Chinese and Korean soldiers shook hands and embraced each other like family members, exchanging comradely greetings. Many CPV soldiers also pinned big red flowers on the chests of their KPA comrades.

On the afternoon of March 6th, the Second Class Merit Company of a certain unit of the CPV, guarding a certain heroic position, specially invited the officers and soldiers of the Heroic Fourth Company of a certain unit of the KPA to a get-together on a hilltop. The Chinese and Korean troops had fought side by side on this hilltop to defeat the American aggressors. At the get-together, the officers and soldiers of these two heroic companies poured out their deep fighting friendship to each other and jointly expressed their firm confidence in striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
