    Ministry of Construction Engineering Dispatches Technicians to the Countryside
    Helping Local Areas Produce Low-Grade Cement
    This newspaper reports: The Ministry of Construction Engineering is dispatching technicians to the countryside to help local areas produce low-grade cement to support farmers in building agricultural irrigation projects.
    Amidst the great leap forward in agriculture and the high tide of industrial construction, the supply of cement is becoming increasingly strained. According to the State Economic Commission's cement allocation plan for the first quarter of this year, there is a shortfall of 470,000 tons compared to actual needs. Last year, approximately 600,000 tons of cement were used for agricultural irrigation projects; however, nearly 1,000,000 tons are required in the first quarter of this year alone. To resolve this contradiction, the Ministry of Construction Engineering convened an emergency meeting. In addition to mobilizing existing enterprises to greatly increase cement production, it was decided to rapidly promote the production of local low-grade cement. Seven engineers and twenty-six technicians were immediately selected and underwent a short period of specialized training. They were then dispatched to eight regions: Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Gansu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Guangdong. After gaining experience, the practice will be widely promoted.

    帮助地方生产低标号水泥
    本报讯　建筑工程部抽调技术人员下乡，帮助地方生产低标号水泥，支援农民兴修农田水利。
    在农业大跃进和工业建设高潮中，水泥的供应日趋紧张。根据国家经济委员会今年第一季的水泥分配计划，比实际需要相差四十七万吨。去年全年用于兴修农田水利的水泥，约为六十万吨；而今年第一季度即需用将近一百万吨。为了解决这个矛盾，建筑工程部召开了紧急会议，除发动现有企业大量增产水泥之外，决定迅速推广地方性低标号水泥的生产，立即抽调了七名工程师和二十六名技术员进行了短期专门学习后，分赴河北、河南、山东、甘肃、湖北、浙江、安徽、广东八个地区，等取得经验后，即普遍推广。
