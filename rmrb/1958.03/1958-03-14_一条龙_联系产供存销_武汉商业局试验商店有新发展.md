Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: The Lifeng Department Store, an experimental store run by cadres of the Wuhan Commercial Bureau, has recently combined with a handicrafts production cooperative after developing into a "one-dragon" experimental store by integrating with the wholesale department and warehouse, which is convenient for systematically studying the problems in the four key links of production, supply, storage, and sales.

In the month since the establishment of the experimental store by Wuhan Commercial Bureau cadres, many problems related to operation and management have been discovered, some of which require the joint cooperation of the wholesale and storage departments to solve. Therefore, the Municipal Commercial Bureau decided to establish a "one-dragon" experimental store on the basis of the retail experimental store, consisting of the Wuhan Daily Necessities Wholesale Department, Suifeng Warehouse, and Lifeng Department Store, according to the commodity circulation links. Salesmen from the wholesale department began to actively contact retail stores to understand their needs and deliver goods to their door, and leading cadres from the wholesale department also began to delve into retail stores. Phenomena such as rigid commodity matching, cumbersome wholesale procedures, and slow delivery in the past have been eliminated, and the time it takes for goods to go from the wholesale department to meeting customers has been shortened by more than half.

In order to further solve the problem of cooperation between industry and commerce, the Municipal Commercial Bureau combined the "one-dragon" experimental store with the City's Eighth Leather Shoe Production Cooperative a few days ago. In response to the problems that have been discovered, the wholesale department has begun to earnestly implement the method of purchasing based on quality and pricing, and the production cooperative has also responded to the wholesale department's requests, producing product specifications and styles according to market needs, and ensuring timely delivery.

    “一条龙”联系产供存销
    武汉商业局试验商店有新发展
    据新华社武汉12日电  武汉市商业局干部的试验商店——丽丰百货商店，在同批发部、仓库结合起来发展成“一条龙”的试验店以后，最近又同手工业生产社结合起来，便于系统地研究产、供、存、销四大环节上的问题。
    武汉市商业局干部建立试验商店一个月来，发现了不少有关经营管理方面的问题，其中有一部分必需由批发、仓储部门共同配合协作才能解决。于是，市商业局决定在零售试验商店的基础上，建立“一条龙”试验店，按照商品流通环节，由武汉市的日用百货批发部、穗丰仓库和丽丰百货商店组成。批发部业务员开始主动地和零售商店联系，了解需要，送货上门，批发部领导干部也开始深入零售商店。过去商品硬性搭配、批发手续繁琐、送货迟缓等现象都已消除，商品从批发部到同顾客见面的时间比原来缩短一半以上。
    为了进一步解决工、商业之间的协作问题，市商业局几天前又把“一条龙”试验店和市第八皮鞋生产社结合起来。针对已经发现的问题，批发部开始切实执行按质论价的收购办法，生产社也对批发部作到有求必应，根据市场需要的产品规格、式样来生产，保证按期交货。
