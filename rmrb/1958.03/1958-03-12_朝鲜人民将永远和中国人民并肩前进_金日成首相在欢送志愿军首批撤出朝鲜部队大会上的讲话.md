Dear Volunteer Army Commander Yang Yong, dear Volunteer Army Political Commissar Wang Ping, dear Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, dear heroic officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army:

Today, the Korean people are about to bid farewell to the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteers, who have shared joys and sorrows in the arduous struggle against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—the American aggressors.

On behalf of all the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Republic's government, I extend warm gratitude and the highest honor to you, who have established immortal merits in the Korean people's struggle for freedom and independence and in safeguarding peace in the Far East.

The Volunteers' Great Achievements Will Last Forever Alongside Korea's Beautiful Mountains and Rivers

When the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang was at its most difficult, the Chinese People's Volunteers came to Korea to aid the Korean people. When our People's Army was struggling hard to confront the numerically superior enemy, the great Chinese people, holding high the banner of defending their homes and country, sent the Volunteer Army, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean front.

The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers was an immense encouragement to the hard-fighting Korean people and a heavy blow to the enemy. Because of your participation, the entire Korean war situation took a decisive turn in our favor.

The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought closely side by side, overcame all kinds of difficulties, repelled the enemy's armed attacks, and completely shattered the enemy's aggressive conspiracy.

The Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and all the Korean people displayed unparalleled heroism and selflessness, tearing apart the myth of so-called "American strength" and thoroughly exposing American imperialism as nothing more than a paper tiger before the people of the world.

In the Korean War against the armed aggression of the American imperialists and their lackeys, many heroic companies and heroic units emerged from your ranks, and countless heroes, including the incredibly brave martyr Yang Gensi, as well as hundreds of thousands of meritorious personnel and model combatants emerged. You defended the highlands and plains of Korea with your blood. Every mountain, every river, every blade of grass and tree in Korea is permeated with your noble blood and filled with the traces of your heroic struggle. The great achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War will last forever alongside Korea's beautiful mountains and rivers.

The Deep Feelings of the Volunteers for the Korean People Will Live Forever in the Hearts of the Korean People

The Chinese People's Volunteers used their free time between battles to help our farmers till the land, sow seeds, and harvest crops, helped repair damaged reservoirs and dikes, and helped restore highways and bridges. You spared no effort, even in fierce battle environments, to alleviate the suffering of the Korean people and for a better tomorrow for the Korean people.

After the armistice, when the Korean people unanimously launched an arduous struggle to rebuild cities and the brutally destroyed countryside from the ruins, the Chinese People's Volunteers actively helped our reconstruction efforts in various places. In just a few years after the war, the Volunteer Army soldiers built more than 806,000 meters of irrigation canals, helping with rural irrigation projects. Furthermore, the Volunteer Army soldiers helped rebuild several magnificent and beautiful schools and urban buildings. At the same time, the Chinese People's Volunteers also saved thousands of tons of military grain and distributed it to our farmers who lacked food due to war damage.

Dear Comrades:

You have always been loyal to the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong to cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree in Korea, and you have cherished the Korean people as if they were your own brothers. You regarded the pain of the Korean people as your own pain and rejoiced in the happiness of the Korean people.

The noble moral qualities of the Chinese People's Volunteers have become a model for the Korean People's Army and our people to learn from. The love and selfless help of the Chinese People's Volunteers for the Korean people has infinitely moved the Korean people.

An infinitely loving and cooperative relationship has been built between the Korean People's Army and the Volunteer Army, and between our people and the Volunteer Army soldiers. Martyr Luo Shengjiao sacrificed his precious life to save a Korean boy. Korean farmer Park Jae-geun shielded Volunteer Army wounded with his own body from the shrapnel of the vile enemy. These facts are a manifestation of the deep friendship between the Chinese People's Volunteers and our people. You have all cherished our elderly and children with the spirit of Martyr Luo Shengjiao. The Korean people all trust you and cherish you with the feelings of farmer Park Jae-geun.

The mountains and rivers of Korea will become more beautiful, and the lives of the Korean people will be improved day by day. Your deep feelings for the Korean people will forever live in the infinitely happy lives of the Korean people. Comrades:

Today, you are completing your lofty mission and returning home with friendship, respect, and honor. When we bid farewell to you, our people are reluctant to part with you.

The Withdrawal of Volunteers from Korea Will Promote the Peaceful Reunification of Korea

The Chinese People's Volunteers will withdraw from Korea in accordance with the joint statement of the Korean and Chinese governments on February 19.

The People's Republic of China has consistently made sincere efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and maintain lasting peace in the Far East. This withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is another manifestation of this effort. It is also an important measure to further promote the peaceful reunification of our country.

However, the American imperialists are the heinous enemies who obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and undermine peace in the East. Unless the American imperialists get out of Korea, the peaceful reunification of Korea cannot be realized, nor can lasting peace in the Far East be expected.

Today, the American imperialists are transporting atomic weapons and rocket weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into an American atomic base. This action by the American imperialists is an action to further intensify the Korean tension and threaten peace in Asia.

The Occupation of South Korea by American Imperialism Is the Root of All the Pain and Misfortune of the Korean People. The Entire Korean People Firmly Demand the Withdrawal of American Troops from Korea

American imperialism has brutally destroyed South Korea's national economy, dragging the South Korean people into a tragic abyss of hunger and poverty. American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang have established a fascist reign of terror in South Korea, brutally suppressing the South Korean people's struggle for freedom and independence.

The occupation of South Korea by American imperialism is the root of all the pain and misfortune of the Korean people.

The entire Korean people unanimously oppose the occupation of South Korea by American imperialism and firmly demand the withdrawal of American troops from Korea. American imperialism cannot justify its aggression by any excuse.

The troops of American imperialism and its puppet countries must withdraw from Korea.

The Korean people have consistently struggled to peacefully reunify the country on a democratic basis, with their own hands, without any foreign interference.

To this end, first of all, the American aggressor troops should be withdrawn from South Korea, and the troop strength of North and South Korea should be reduced to the minimum. Lasting peace in Korea should be guaranteed.

Any Aggressive Action by American Imperialism Cannot Stop the Korean People's Road to the Reunification and Independence of the Fatherland

We continue to advocate that North and South Korea should eliminate estrangement, interact with each other, cooperate with all political parties, social organizations, and individuals who peacefully reunify the country on a democratic basis, and gather together with them for consultation. Only in this way can our peaceful reunification be realized.

Any aggressive action by American imperialism cannot stop the Korean people's road to the reunification and independence of the fatherland, and the overall situation is developing in our favor. The united strength of the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is immeasurably stronger than the forces of imperialism.

In a short period after the war, the Korean people have made tremendous achievements in socialist construction. Last year, our country's total industrial output value reached 2.8 times the pre-war level, and the total grain output also significantly exceeded the pre-war level.

Our people are united as one with steel-like solidarity around the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, their political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm have risen to an unprecedented level, and our people will reliably defend the socialist achievements of the northern half of the Republic and will stand firmly on the eastern frontier of safeguarding peace and socialism. The Korean people will strive to strengthen the internationalist friendship and solidarity with the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, firmly rely on the increasingly consolidated revolutionary democratic base in the northern half, and will surely realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

Dear Comrades:

The friendly and cooperative relationship between the Korean and Chinese peoples has a long history. Especially in the struggle against American imperialism, the unity of our two peoples has been strengthened as never before. The Korean people will continue to strive to further strengthen the friendship and unity with the brotherly Chinese people, and will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people in the struggle to safeguard peace and socialism.

I hope that after you return to your country, you will convey to the Chinese people the Korean people's warm gratitude and respect and love for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

I firmly believe that after you return to your country, in the struggle to build a socialist motherland, you will also display heroism and selflessness as you did in Korea, and make brilliant achievements with all your enthusiasm.

Long Live the Glorious Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long Live the Chinese Communist Party and the Great Chinese People!

Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship and Unity Between the Korean People and the Chinese People! (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜人民将永远和中国人民并肩前进
    金日成首相在欢送志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队大会上的讲话
    亲爱的志愿军司令员杨勇同志，亲爱的志愿军政治委员王平同志，亲爱的张天云中将同志，亲爱的英雄的志愿军官兵们：
    今天，朝鲜人民就要和在反对朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美国侵略者的艰苦斗争中共甘苦同患难的兄弟般的中国人民志愿军告别了。
    我代表全朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府，谨向在朝鲜人民争取自由独立和维护远东和平的斗争中建立了不朽功勋的你们，致以热烈的感谢和最大的荣誉。
    志愿军的丰功伟绩，将同朝鲜美丽的山河一齐万古长存
    正当朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的祖国解放战争处于最艰苦的时候，中国人民志愿军为了援助朝鲜人民来到了朝鲜。当我们人民军队为了迎击数量上占优势的敌人进行艰苦奋斗的时候，伟大的中国人民高举着保家卫国的旗帜，由自己的优秀儿女组成志愿军，开到了朝鲜前线。
    中国人民志愿军的参战，对艰苦奋斗的朝鲜人民是个无限的鼓舞，而对于敌人是个沉重的打击。由于你们的参战，整个朝鲜战局向有利于我们的方向有了决定性的扭转。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军紧密的并肩作战，克服种种困难，击退敌人的武装进攻，彻底粉碎了敌人的侵略阴谋。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军以及全体朝鲜人民，发挥无比的英雄主义和忘我精神，撕破了所谓“美国强大性”的神话，并且在全世界人民面前彻底揭露美帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎。
    在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略的朝鲜战争中，从你们的队伍里出现了很多英雄连和英雄部队，并且涌现了无比勇敢的杨根思烈士等许多英雄，以及几十万功臣和模范战斗员。你们以鲜血捍卫了朝鲜的高地和原野，在朝鲜的每一座山、每一条河、每一棵草木里，都浸透了你们高贵的鲜血，满布着你们英勇斗争的痕迹。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中所建立的丰功伟绩，将同朝鲜美丽的山河一齐万古长存。
    志愿军对朝鲜人民的深厚感情将永远活在朝鲜人民心中
    中国人民志愿军利用战斗的空隙时间，帮助我国农民耕地、播种和收割，帮助修复被破坏的水库和堤坝，帮助恢复了公路和桥梁。你们为了减轻朝鲜人民的痛苦，为了朝鲜人民更美好的明天，在激烈的战斗环境中也竭尽一切努力。
    停战后，朝鲜人民为了在废墟上重建城市和被残酷破坏的农村，而一致展开艰苦斗争的时候，中国人民志愿军在各地积极帮助了我们的恢复建设。志愿军勇士们仅在战后的几年中，兴修长达八十万零六千多公尺的水渠，帮助了农村的灌溉工程。并且，志愿军勇士们帮助重建了几座雄伟美观的学校和城市建筑物。同时，中国人民志愿军还节约出几千吨军粮分给了我国因战争灾害缺粮的农民。
    亲爱的同志：
    你们始终忠诚于中国共产党和毛泽东同志关于对朝鲜的一山一水一草一木也加以爱护的指示，像爱护自己的兄弟一样爱护了朝鲜人民。你们把朝鲜人民的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，把朝鲜人民的幸福当作自己的幸福而高兴。
    中国人民志愿军高尚的道德品质，成了朝鲜人民军和我国人民值得学习的模范。中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的热爱和自我牺牲的帮助，无限地感动了朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民军和志愿军之间，我国人民和志愿军勇士们之间，建成了无限友爱和互相合作的关系。罗盛教烈士为了拯救朝鲜少年，献出了自己宝贵的生命。朝鲜农民朴在根为了救出志愿军伤员，以自己身体挡住了万恶敌人的弹片。这些事实，是中国人民志愿军和我国人民有着深厚友爱的表现。你们都用罗盛教烈士的这种精神，爱护了我们老人和儿童。朝鲜人民都怀着朴在根农民的这种心情，信赖你们，爱护你们。
    朝鲜的山河将更加美丽，朝鲜人民的生活将日益得到提高。你们对朝鲜人民的深厚感情，将永远活在朝鲜人民无限幸福的生活里。同志们：
    今天你们完成自己崇高的任务，带着友爱、尊敬和荣誉，就要回国了。当欢送你们的时候，我国人民的心情是依依不舍的。
    志愿军撤出朝鲜，会促进朝鲜的和平统一
    中国人民志愿军根据2月19日朝中两国政府的联合声明，将要撤出朝鲜。
    中华人民共和国始终一贯为和平解决朝鲜问题和维护远东的持久和平，尽了诚挚的努力。这次中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，是这种努力的又一次表现。也是更加促进和平统一我国的重要措施。
    然而，美帝国主义者是阻挠朝鲜的和平统一、破坏东方和平的万恶敌人。美帝国主义不滚出朝鲜去，那么就不能实现朝鲜的和平统一，也不能期望远东的持久和平。
    今天美帝国主义者把原子武器和火箭武器运进南朝鲜，正在把南朝鲜变为美国的原子基地。美帝国主义者这种行动，是进一步加紧朝鲜的紧张局势、威胁亚洲和平的行动。
    美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜是朝鲜人民一切痛苦和不幸的根源。全朝鲜人民坚决要求美国军队撤出朝鲜
    美帝国主义残酷地破坏了南朝鲜的民族经济，把南朝鲜人民拖入了饥饿贫穷的悲惨深渊。美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮在南朝鲜树立法西斯恐怖统治，残酷地镇压着南朝鲜人民争取自由和独立的斗争。
    美帝国主义对南朝鲜的侵占，是朝鲜人民一切痛苦和不幸的根源。
    全朝鲜人民一致反对美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜，坚决要求美国军队撤出朝鲜。美帝国主义使用任何借口，都不能为他们的侵略作辩护的。
    美帝国主义及其仆从国家的军队，必须从朝鲜撤出去。
    朝鲜人民为了在没有任何外国干涉的条件下，在民主的基础上，用自己的手来和平统一祖国，始终一贯地进行着斗争。
    为此，首先应该从南朝鲜撤出美国侵略军队，应该把南北朝鲜的兵力缩减到最低限度。朝鲜的持久和平应该得到保障。
    美帝国主义的任何侵略行动，都不能阻挡朝鲜人民为祖国的统一、独立而前进的道路
    我们继续主张南北朝鲜之间应当消除隔阂，互相来往，同那些在民主的基础上和平统一祖国的一切政党、社会团体和个别人士合作，跟他们聚在一堂进行协商。只有这样，我们的和平统一才能得到实现。
    美帝国主义的任何侵略行动，也不能阻挡朝鲜人民为祖国的统一、独立而前进的道路，并且整个局势的发展是对我们有利的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民团结起来的力量，是比帝国主义势力强大无比的。
    在战后短期内，朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的成就。去年我国的工业总产值达到了战前水平的二点八倍，谷物总产量也显著地超过了战前水平。
    我国人民在朝鲜劳动党和共和党政府的周围钢铁般的团结一致，他们的政治热情和劳动热情有了空前的高涨，我国人民将可靠地捍卫共和国北半部的社会主义成果，将坚定地屹立在维护和平和社会主义的东方前哨上。朝鲜人民竭力加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的国际主义友谊团结，坚决依靠日益巩固的北半部革命民主基地，一定要实现祖国的和平统一。
    亲爱的同志们：
    朝中两国人民的友好合作关系是有着悠久历史的，特别是在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，我们两国人民的团结得到了空前的加强。朝鲜人民今后也将努力进一步加强同兄弟般的中国人民的友谊团结，并且为维护和平和社会主义的斗争中，将永远和中国人民并肩前进。
    我希望同志们回到祖国以后，向中国人民转达朝鲜人民对中国人民和中国人民志愿军的热烈的谢意和尊敬与热爱的情意。
    我深信你们回到祖国以后，在建设社会主义祖国的斗争中，也跟在朝鲜一样地发挥英雄主义和忘我精神，竭尽所有热情来取得光辉的成就。
    光荣的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中国共产党和伟大的中国人民万岁！
    朝鲜人民和中国人民之间牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！（新华社讯）
