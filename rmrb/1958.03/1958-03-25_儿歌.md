Nursery Rhyme

Little stone mill,
Grinding away, grumbling, getting up early to grind tofu.
Tofu is fragrant, tofu is sweet,
I am a hardworking "little commune member."

Small manure tank,
Square and sturdy, picking up manure to put inside.
One basket of manure, two baskets of manure,
In ten days it will be full of a big tank.
Every family's manure tank is full,
The commune's granary is full of grain.
