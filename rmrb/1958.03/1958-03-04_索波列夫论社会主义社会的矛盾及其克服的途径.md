Sobolev on the Contradictions of Socialist Society and Ways to Overcome Them

The Soviet journal "Communist" published A. Sobolev's article "On the Contradictions of Socialist Society and Ways to Overcome Them" in its second issue of 1958.

The author of the article states: "Marx and Lenin provided insightful instructions on the issue of contradictions under socialism and the ways to overcome them. The issue of contradictions in socialist society has been comprehensively discussed in the documents of the CPSU congresses, conferences, and the resolutions of the Central Committee plenary sessions. Communist parties of all countries have carefully studied the contradictions that dominate society and have pointed out ways to overcome these contradictions. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong personally have made enormous contributions to the handling of this issue."

The author criticizes the currently popular erroneous views in the study of Soviet society that emphasize unity and ignore contradictions, or emphasize contradictions and ignore unity. He then studies the contradictions of socialist society from the aspects of antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions, necessary and accidental contradictions, major and minor contradictions, as well as the role of contradictions in social life and their impact on historical development. The article states: "In socialist society, the basic and dominant contradictions are non-antagonistic contradictions. Antagonistic factors will be preserved within socialist countries for a long period, but they are subordinate." The author points out that some people confuse the issue of resolving antagonistic contradictions by peaceful means with the possibility of capitalism peacefully growing into socialism, which is completely wrong.

When studying the relationship between productive forces and relations of production under socialism, the author says that the two are unified and adapted to each other, but there are also contradictions. There "is not and cannot be complete adaptation" between productive forces and relations of production. This is because productive forces are the most active and constantly changing aspect of production under socialism, while relations of production are a less active and more stable aspect. There will always be outdated factors in the economic structure that need to be changed, or factors that are gradually becoming outdated but are not yet mature enough to be changed. Therefore, at a certain stage of development, there will be a mismatch between individual aspects of the productive forces and the relations of production.

The article states: "However, under certain historical conditions, another kind of contradiction may arise between productive forces and relations of production under socialism. Sometimes a situation arises where socialist transformation is completed, a new economic structure is established, but the existing level of development of the productive forces is not sufficient to fully realize the principles of socialism. Thus, there is a contradiction between the advanced economic system and the material resources controlled by society, a contradiction between the new economic relations and the relatively backward material and technical base. Of course, this does not mean that the productive forces are no longer the most active and revolutionary factor in social production, and that the relations of production have a decisive significance. It means that the state of the productive forces during the revolutionary period, in terms of their nature and level of development, requires breaking the old relations of production and establishing new, socialist relations of production. However, after breaking the old relations of production, such a leap forward has occurred in social development, causing the scale of production to lag behind the demands put forward by the new economic structure. In this case, society's attention is first directed to the development of production, and the new relations of production open up a broad road for the vigorous development of productive forces."

    索波列夫论社会主义社会的矛盾及其克服的途径
    1958年第二期苏联“共产党人”杂志上，发表了阿·索波列夫的文章：“关于社会主义社会的矛盾及其克服途径”。
    文章作者说：“关于社会主义下的矛盾及其克服的途径问题，马克思和列宁有过精辟的指示。社会主义社会的矛盾问题在苏共代表大会、代表会议的文件和党中央全会的决议中得到了全面的论述。各国共产党都仔细地研究了在社会中占统治地位的矛盾并且指出了克服这些矛盾的途径。中国共产党和毛泽东同志个人对这一问题的处理作了巨大的贡献。”
    作者批判了目前流行的在研究苏维埃社会时强调统一、忽视矛盾和强调矛盾、忽视统一的错误观点，然后从对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾、必然矛盾和偶然矛盾、主要矛盾和次要矛盾，以及矛盾在社会生活中的作用和对历史发展的影响等方面研究了社会主义社会的矛盾。文章中说：“在社会主义社会中，基本的、占统治地位的矛盾是非对抗性的矛盾。对抗的因素在社会主义国家内部会保存很长一个时期，但是他们是占从属地位。”作者指出，有些人把用和平方法解决对抗性的矛盾问题同资本主义和平长入社会主义的可能性混淆在一起，这是完全错误的。
    作者在研究社会主义下的生产力和生产关系之间的相互关系时说，这两者是统一的、相适应的，但是也有矛盾。生产力和生产关系之间“没有也根本不可能有完全的适应”。这是因为生产力在社会主义条件下也是生产中最为活跃的、不断变化的一面，而生产关系是活跃性较差、较为稳固的一面。在经济结构中总会有已经过时的、需要改变的因素，或者是在逐渐过时但虽已显得落后而要改变还不够成熟的因素，因此在一定发展阶段就会形成生产力和生产关系的个别方面的不相适应。
    文章中说：“但是在一定历史条件下，社会主义下的生产力和生产关系也可能产生另一种矛盾。有时形成这样一种情况：社会主义改造完成了，新的经济结构建立了，而生产力发展的现有水平还不足以保证完全实现社会主义的原则。于是就产生了先进的经济制度和社会所支配的物质资源之间的矛盾，新的经济关系和比较落后的物质技术基础之间的矛盾。当然不能因此就说，生产力不再是社会生产的最活跃、革命的因素，而生产关系具有了决定性的意义。这就是说，革命时期的生产力状态，按其性质和发展水平来说，要求打破旧的生产关系和建立起新的、社会主义的生产关系；但是在打破旧的生产关系之后，在社会发展上就发生了这么一个跃进；致使生产规模落后于新的经济结构所提出的要求了。在这种情况下，社会的注意力首先向着生产的发展，而新的生产关系为生产力的蓬勃发展开辟了康庄大道。”
