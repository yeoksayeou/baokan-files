Relying on the Creative Spirit of the Masses; Implementing the Principle of Adapting to Local Conditions and Making the Best Use of Each
Hebei Launches Movement to Manufacture Water Lifting Tools
Producing 1.4 Million Pieces of Water Lifting Equipment Rapidly with Every Township Processing and Every Commune Taking Action

Our newspaper Cangzhou, March 25th report: Learning from Cangxian Prefecture, catching up with Cangxian Prefecture, and swiftly launching a mass movement to manufacture simple water lifting tools throughout the province—this was the decision made at the Hebei Province Water Lifting Tool Conference held in Cangzhen from the 17th to the 21st.

The conference summarized the advanced experience of Cangxian Prefecture in overcoming the idea of simply relying on state supply by "looking upwards and reaching upwards," and relying on the power of the masses to solve the problem of water lifting tools. At the same time, it organized all participants to visit the exhibition of simple water lifting tools self-made by the masses in Cangxian Prefecture. According to the technical appraisal team's assessment of the more than 130 various water lifting tools on display, these water lifting tools have the advantages of being small and diverse, using local materials, having a simple structure, saving labor, money, and iron, and yielding quick results. Various localities can vigorously promote them based on the principles of "each having its own strengths, each taking what it needs, adapting to local conditions, and making the best use of each."

The conference pointed out: At present, the water conservancy construction movement in Hebei Province is developing rapidly. It is estimated that by June of this year, the province's irrigated area will leap from more than 27 million mu last year to 80 million mu. However, in addition to the area that can be irrigated by existing water lifting tools and gravity irrigation, more than 30 million mu still require the addition of more than 1.4 million water lifting tools to solve the irrigation problem. Therefore, the conference called on all localities to learn from Cangxian Prefecture, catch up with Cangxian Prefecture, and quickly launch a mass movement to manufacture water lifting tools throughout the province. It demanded that leaders in various localities attach great importance to this work, and immediately help agricultural cooperatives make proper arrangements in terms of labor organization, funds and materials, and time, so as to organize agricultural cooperatives to universally open small-scale water conservancy tool processing factories, and make use of all usable waste, scrap materials, and scattered wood, so as to achieve simultaneous processing in every township and action in every cooperative. On the one hand, extensively imitate various water lifting tools manufactured and transformed by the masses in Cangxian Prefecture that are suitable for the local area; on the other hand, use your brains to invent and create more and better water lifting tools. At the same time, industrial and handicraft departments in various localities are required to not only cooperate with agricultural cooperatives in rushing to manufacture simple water lifting tools, but also organize forces to strengthen technical guidance to agricultural cooperatives. Commercial departments should also actively cooperate with the work, and organize sources of goods and supply them in a timely manner for raw materials and parts that cannot be solved by various localities themselves. Strive to basically complete the task of processing and producing more than 1.4 million water lifting tools by the end of April at the latest; and ensure that each tool is made and used, giving full play to irrigation efficiency and ensuring that spring sowing production and wheat irrigation are not delayed.

Through this meeting and visit, the participants unanimously believed that their gains were that they had liberated their thinking, broadened their horizons, and further enhanced their confidence in relying on the masses to overcome difficulties.

    依靠群众的创造精神　根据因地制宜各得其用的原则
    河北开展制造提水工具运动
    乡乡加工，社社动手，迅速生产提水工具140万件
    本报沧镇25日电　学沧县专区，赶沧县专区，迅速在全省掀起一个群众性的制造简易提水工具运动，这是17日到21日在沧镇召开的河北省提水工具会议所作的决定。
    这次会议总结了沧县专区克服“眼睛向上看，手向上伸”的单纯依赖国家供应的思想，依靠群众力量解决提水工具问题的先进经验；同时组织全体与会者参观了沧县专区举办的群众自制的简易提水工具展览会。根据技术鉴定小组对展出的一百三十多件各种提水工具的鉴定，认为这些提水工具具有小型多样、就地取材、构造简单、省工省钱省铁、收效快等优点，各地可以本着“各有所长，各有所取，因地制宜，各得其用”的原则，大力推广。
    会议指出：目前河北省的水利建设运动正在一日千里的发展着，预计到今年6月，全省灌溉面积就将由去年的二千七百多万亩跃进到八千万亩，但是除去已有的各种提水工具可以提水灌溉的面积和自流灌溉面积以外，还有三千多万亩需要新增加一百四十多万件提水工具来解决灌溉问题。因此，会议号召各地学沧县专区，赶沧县专区，迅速在全省掀起一个群众性制造提水工具运动。要求各地领导充分重视这一工作，立即帮助农业社在劳力组织、资金物料、时间等方面加以妥善安排，以便组织农业社普遍开办小型水利工具加工厂，把一切可以利用的废物、废料、零星木材等利用起来，作到乡乡齐加工，社社都动手，一面大量仿造适用于本地区的沧县专区群众制造和改造的各种提水工具；一面开动脑筋，发明创造更多更好的提水工具。同时要求各地工业和手工业部门，除要配合农业社赶制简易提水工具外，还要组织力量对农业社加强技术指导。商业部门也要积极配合工作，对于各地不能自己解决的原料和部件，要组织货源及时供应。争取至迟在4月底前，基本完成加工生产一百四十多万件提水工具的任务；并要作到造一件，用一件，充分发挥灌溉效能，保证不误春播生产和小麦灌溉。
    通过这次会议和参观，与会者一致认为给予他们的收获是，解放了思想，打开了眼界，进一步增强了依靠群众克服困难的信心。
