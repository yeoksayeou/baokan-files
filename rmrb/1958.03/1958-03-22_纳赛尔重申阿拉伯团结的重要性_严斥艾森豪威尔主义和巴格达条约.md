Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 21st: In a speech delivered by Arab United Republic President Nasser on the evening of March 20th at a mass rally attended by approximately 500,000 people in Cairo Square, he once again emphasized the importance of Arab countries uniting against imperialism, and condemned the Eisenhower Doctrine and the Baghdad Military Pact.

In discussing his recent three-week visit to Syria, Nasser said, "It is very clear that conspiracies are currently being plotted around the Syrian region, armies are being gathered, and various accusations are being leveled against us in an attempt to undermine our front and create discord between the people and the army." He said that the Syrian people had achieved victory. Despite threats, psychological warfare, unfounded accusations, and conspiracies, the people of the Arab United Republic have achieved victory.

Nasser once again criticized the Baghdad Pact, saying that its purpose was to subject Arab countries to the rule of Britain and the United States. He said that the lie that the Baghdad Pact was concluded to protect the Arab people from Soviet aggression was exposed when the member state Britain, along with France and Israel, attacked Egypt in 1956.

Nasser pointed out that after the failure of the aggression, imperialism attempted to undermine Arab nationalism through means and conspiracies such as the Jordanian coup, the Eisenhower Doctrine, and threats against Egypt and Syria, but these attempts also failed. This victory was achieved through unity. The people of the Arab freedom front believe that only unity and solidarity can free them from foreign shackles. Unity has deprived the imperialists of all their weapons. All that remains for the imperialists is the unreliable weapon of conspiracy and assassination. But they seem to have forgotten that cowardly acts of assassination can never change the course of history.

Nasser criticized the Iraq-Jordan Federation as being established under the instigation of imperialist countries to confront the Arab United Republic. Nasser said that Iraq had contacted the United States, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and other Baghdad Pact member states, requesting them not to recognize the Arab United Republic. He said it was clear that the henchmen of imperialism also felt that the principles upon which the Arab United Republic was built were a threat to their own survival because they represent reactionary tendencies.

Nasser concluded by saying that the Arab United Republic has become the front line in defending the entire Arab nation, and it has become a tool for expressing the inner emotions of the Arab nation suppressed by violence. It has declared its willingness to assist those who are fighting for the liberation of all Arab countries. He said: "We also believe that because we pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence, we are also making a significant contribution to the cause of world peace."

### 纳赛尔重申阿拉伯团结的重要性  严斥艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约

    纳赛尔重申阿拉伯团结的重要性
    严斥艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达条约
    据新华社开罗21日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔20日傍晚在开罗广场约有五十万人参加的一个群众大会上发表的演说中，再一次强调阿拉伯国家在帝国主义面前团结一致的重要性，并且谴责艾森豪威尔主义和巴格达军事条约。
    纳赛尔在谈到他最近对叙利亚进行的为时三周的访问时说，“十分清楚，在叙利亚地区周围目前正有人在策划阴谋，集结军队，并且对我们提出各种指责，以图破坏我们的阵线，并在人民和军队中间制造纷争。”他说，但是叙利亚人民已经取得了胜利。尽管有威胁、神经战，毫无根据的指责和阴谋活动，阿拉伯联合共和国的人民已经取得了胜利。
    纳赛尔再一次抨击巴格达条约说，巴格达条约的目的是要使阿拉伯国家受英国和美国的统治。他说，当巴格达条约的成员国英国在1956年同法国和以色列一道进攻埃及的时候，所谓缔结巴格达条约是为了保卫阿拉伯人民免遭苏联侵略的谎言就被戳穿了。
    纳赛尔指出，在侵略失败以后，帝国主义又企图利用约旦政变、艾森豪威尔主义和威胁埃及和叙利亚等手段和阴谋活动来破坏阿拉伯民族主义，但是这些尝试也失败了。这个胜利是由于团结一致才取得的。阿拉伯自由阵线的人民认为，只有联合和团结才能使他们摆脱外国的桎梏。团结已经使帝国主义者失去了他们的一切武器。帝国主义者所剩下的只是阴谋暗杀这种不可靠的武器。但是他们似乎已经忘记，懦怯的暗杀活动决不能改变历史的进程。
    纳赛尔抨击伊拉克—约旦联邦是在帝国主义国家的嗾使之下建立起来对抗阿拉伯联合共和国的。纳赛尔说，伊拉克曾经同美国、伊朗、巴基斯坦、土耳其和其他巴格达条约成员国进行了接触，要求它们不要承认阿拉伯联合共和国。他说，很明显，帝国主义的走卒们也感觉到，阿拉伯联合共和国借以建立起来的原则是对于他们自己的生存的威胁。因为他们代表的是反动的倾向。
    纳赛尔最后说，阿拉伯联合共和国已经成为保卫整个阿拉伯民族的第一线，它已经成为表达被暴力压抑下的阿拉伯民族内心情绪的工具。它已经声明它愿意援助那些为争取所有阿拉伯国家的解放而斗争的人。他说：“我们还认为，由于我们奉行和平共处的政策，我们还在很大程度上对世界和平事业作出贡献。”
