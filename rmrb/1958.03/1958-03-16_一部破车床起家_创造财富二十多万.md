Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 15th. The Machinery Processing Factory of the Huangshi City Production and Education Institute in Hubei Province, which started with a broken lathe, has created more than 200,000 yuan in wealth for the country in two and a half years.

In June 1955, the Huangshi City Production and Education Institute received a scrapped and broken lathe from the Poverty Relief Production Committee. After some minor repairs, they recruited several skilled workers and set up a small processing plant. At that time, the factory's funds were only 200 yuan, so they used various discarded screws and rivets, tempering and processing them into raw materials. The workers were also diligent and frugal in their lives. There were no dormitories or cooks in the factory, so they slept next to the machines and workbenches, cooking their own meals in their spare time. Their slogan was: everything for the development of production, everything for the construction of socialism.

After two and a half years of hard work, the factory has added equipment, expanded its production scope, and built new factory buildings. The number of production workers has increased from four to fifty-four.

This year, the factory's total output value is planned to be 180,000 yuan, equivalent to more than 85% of the previous two and a half years.

    一部破车床起家
    创造财富二十多万
    新华社武汉15日电　一部破车床起家的湖北省黄石市生产教养院机械加工厂，两年半内已为国家创造了二十多万元的财富。
    1955年6月，黄石市生产教养院从贫民生产委员会接受了一部报废了的破车床，稍加修理后，招请了几位技术工人，办起一个小型加工厂。当时厂里的资金只有二百元，他们就利用各种废旧螺丝和铆钉，回火加工作原料。工人们生活上也处处克勤克俭，工厂里没有宿舍和炊事员，他们就睡在机器和工作台旁边，利用工余时间自己做饭。他们的口号是：一切为了发展生产，一切为了建设社会主义。
    经过两年半的艰苦奋斗，这个厂已经增添了设备，扩大了生产范围，盖了新厂房。生产职工由四人增加到了五十四人。
    今年，这个厂的总产值计划为十八万元，相当于前两年半的85％以上。
