Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd: The political and legal departments and personnel departments of central state organs have exposed a large number of wasteful phenomena in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, proving that these departments are not "clean slates" but have much waste to oppose.

Serious Waste of Operational and Administrative Expenses

According to preliminary statistics from eight units including the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice, the Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the State Council Personnel Bureau, and the State Archives Bureau, the waste and backlog of state assets amounts to 200 million yuan.

According to the revelations, the biggest waste in the political and legal departments and personnel departments is in the use of operational expenses and the backlog of materials. Preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs show that more than 78 million yuan was wasted in operational expenses. The Personnel Bureau accumulates about 20% of the budgeted funds every year. The Ministry of Justice's office accumulated 73% of the 1957 operational expense budget. These departments also have significant waste in the use of administrative expenses. Some units have purchased office supplies that can be used for a hundred years. Some units know they have a lot of equipment but do not try to dispose of it or turn it over to higher authorities. For example, the Personnel Bureau has only 130 people, but it has more than 1,500 chairs and more than 500 tables. Even more serious is that this unit provides two sets of chairs for cadres above the rank of section chief: soft chairs for winter and rattan chairs for summer.

Showing Off Officialdom, Displaying Extravagance, and Acting Spoil

In this campaign, these departments paid special attention to examining wasteful phenomena politically and ideologically, and were determined to oppose bureaucracy, lethargy, and all unhealthy tendencies. A big-character poster from the State Archives Bureau said: When a deputy director received the task assigned by higher authorities to formulate a seven-year cadre work plan, he did not study it carefully but handed it over to the division chief, who handed it over to the section chief and staff. The section chief was sick, and the staff drafted a plan in two and a half days, handed it over to the division chief, and the division chief did not make any comments before handing it over to the deputy director. The deputy director only changed the percentage figures of cadre promotions within seven years. Some big-character posters also criticized some leading cadres for being both bureaucratic, extravagant, and spoiled. For example, some leading cadres take planes when they should not, either on business trips or returning from business trips. Some leading cadres make long-distance calls to the provinces and cities they are going to on business trips, asking them to send cars to the station to pick them up. Some leading cadres of the Supreme People's Procuratorate made long-distance calls to Fushun when they went to work in Fushun, asking Fushun to send cars to Shenyang Station to pick them up. The masses criticized these cadres for being completely bureaucratic and spoiled.

These departments seriously examined the ideological roots of waste, proving that much waste is caused by leadership's bureaucracy and subjectivism. The leaders of the Ming and Qing Archives of the State Archives Bureau were subjective and did not listen to the opinions of the masses. Eight people spent more than a year making more than 20,000 cards, which turned out to be useless.

Many cadres proposed during the airing of views that we should not only examine the causes of waste, but also pay attention to learning from the lessons in a more practical way.

Now the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign in these departments is in full swing, forming a climax of airing views. These departments proposed to use this campaign to achieve great economic savings, great ideological improvement, great improvement in work style, and great changes in methods.

### 政法部门也不是“清水衙门”  官风暮气要打掉阔风娇气需扫光

    政法部门也不是“清水衙门”
    官风暮气要打掉阔风娇气需扫光
    双反运动将使这些部门在经济上大节省，思想上大提高，作风上大改进，方法上大改变。
    据新华社2日讯　中央国家机关中政法部门和人事部门在反浪费反保守运动中，揭发出大量的浪费现象，证明这些部门不是“清水衙门”，而是大有浪费可反。事业费行政费浪费严重
    据最高人民检察院、内务部、公安部、司法部、民族事务委员会、华侨事务委员会、国务院人事局、国家档案局等八个单位在这个运动中的初步统计，浪费和积压国家资财有两亿元。
    根据揭露，政法部门和人事部门最大的浪费是在使用事业费和积压物资方面。内务部初步统计，在事业费方面共浪费了七千八百多万元。人事局每年要积压预算费20％左右。司法部机关积压1957年业务费预算73％。这些部门在使用行政费方面也有很大的浪费。有个别单位购置的办公用品可以用一百年。有些单位明知用具很多，也不想办法处理或上缴。如人事局只有一百三十人，而椅凳就有一千五百多个，桌子五百多张。更严重的是这个单位给科长以上的干部备了两套椅子：冬天坐软椅，夏天坐藤椅。
  耍官气摆阔气还撒娇气
    这些部门在这次运动中，特别注意从政治上和思想上去检查浪费现象，决心反掉官风、暮气和一切歪风邪气。国家档案局一张大字报说：一位副局长在接到上级布置的制定七年干部工作规划任务时，没有认真研究，就交给处长，处长又交给科长和科员，科长病了，科员用两天半的时间草拟了一个规划，交给处长，处长没有提一点意见就交给副局长，这位副局长只是把在七年内干部提升的百分比的数字改了一下。还有一些大字报批评一些领导干部既有官风，又摆阔气，还撒娇气。如有些领导干部出差或出差回来不应该坐飞机也要坐飞机。有些领导干部出差时先打长途电话给他所要去的省市，要人家派汽车到车站去接。最高人民检察院有些领导干部到抚顺工作时，先打长途电话给抚顺，要抚顺派汽车到沈阳车站去接。群众批评这些干部是官风娇气俱全。
    这些部门认真地检查了造成浪费的思想根源。证明许多浪费是领导上的官僚主义和主观主义造成的。国家档案局明清档案馆的领导上主观主义，不听取群众意见，有八个人花了一年多时间做了两万多张卡片，结果一点用处也没有。
    许多干部在鸣放中提出，我们不仅要检查浪费原因，更现实的是要注意吸取教训。
    现在这些部门的反浪费反保守运动正搞得热火朝天，形成了鸣放高潮。这些部门提出，要通过这个运动，来个经济上大节省、思想上大提高、作风上大改进、方法上大改变。　（附图片）
