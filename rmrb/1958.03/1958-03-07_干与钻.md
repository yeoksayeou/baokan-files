    Work Hard and Study Diligently
    Zhuang Ping
    Everyone working in rural areas is beginning to acknowledge that not learning agricultural technology just won't cut it anymore; so how to learn? This is quite a brain-racking problem. In XuShui County, some people once suggested learning first and then working, or working first and then learning. Later, the XuShui County Party Committee found a way to resolve this contradiction, and that method was to learn while working, learning while using.
    Both working and studying diligently, this is a contradiction, but it is also unified and can be resolved. Doesn't the experience of XuShui provide an example? To build a reservoir on the plains, there was no experience in the past, even basic knowledge such as levels, slopes, and flow rates was lacking. Could they first go to Beijing to attend a technical school for a period of time, and then go back to build the reservoir? Of course not! Therefore, the leading cadres of the XuShui County Party Committee learned the technology during the exploration, design, and construction of the first plain reservoir, learning from books and also on the construction site, learning a little and using it a little. When the reservoir was completed, the technology was also learned. This vividly illustrates that contradictions can be resolved. If you want to work, you must study diligently; if you don't study diligently, you won't succeed. If you study diligently and well, you will work well; if you don't study diligently, you won't work well. Those who put work and study in opposition, sighing and complaining in the face of contradictions, are the most hopeless people.
    Another method in XuShui County is: learn whatever difficulty arises. Within three months, they trained a technical team of more than 4,000 people, including people from all walks of life, and they initially overcame the various technical difficulties in the Great Leap Forward through various professional conferences and on-the-spot technology transfer. This is the method of the mass line. Relying solely on a few leading cadres, or solving the contradiction between technology and work one by one using handicraft methods, cannot keep up with the situation of the Great Leap Forward.
    In this large-scale technical learning movement, XuShui County also encountered difficulties with teachers and teaching materials. How did they solve this difficulty? They also didn't beg for external assistance, but instead relied on their own efforts, using local materials, and invited all kinds of people in the area who understood technology to be teachers. Agricultural technicians and livestock and veterinary station veterinarians are all good teachers, and their experience is good teaching material. There is nothing mysterious here; the question is whether you are looking downwards. If you look downwards, you will find teachers everywhere. "When three men walk together, at least one of them can be my teacher," not to mention that there are definitely more than three people around you.
    Of course, technology is endless. New contradictions will continue to arise with the development of the situation. XuShui will not and should not stop at this starting point.

    干与钻
    庄平
    一切在农村工作的人，开始承认不学农业技术是吃不开了；那么怎样学呢？这却是一个伤脑筋的难题。徐水县就曾有人提出先钻后干或者先干后钻。后来，徐水县委找到了解决这个矛盾的方法，方法就是边干边钻，边学边用。
    又要干，又要钻，这是矛盾，可又是统一的，能够解决的。徐水的经验不是提供了一个例证吗？要在平原建水库，过去没有经验，甚至连水平、坡度、流量等常识也缺乏。难道能够先到北京来住一个时期技术学校，再回去建水库吗？当然不行！于是，徐水县委的领导干部们，就在第一座平原水库的勘察、设计和施工的过程中学技术，从书本上学，又在工地上学，学一点，用一点，水库完工，技术也学会了。这生动地说明：矛盾是可以解决的。既要干，就必须钻，不钻，就干不成，钻得好，就干得好，钻不好，就干不好。那种把干和钻对立起来，站在矛盾面前唉声叹气的人，才是最没出息的人。
    徐水县的另一个办法是：什么困难就学什么。他们在三个月内训练出一支包括各行各业的四千多人的技术队伍，并且通过各种专业会议，就地传授技术，初步克服了大跃进中的各种技术困难。这是群众路线的方法。单靠少数领导干部，单靠手工业的方法一个一个地去解决技术与工作之间的矛盾，是赶不上大跃进的形势的。
    在这种大规模地学习技术运动中，徐水县也碰到了教员和教材的困难，怎样解决这个困难呢？他们同样不是乞求外援，而是自力更生，就地取材，请当地各种各样懂得技术的人来当教员，农业技术、畜牧兽医站的防疫员都是好教员，他们的经验就是好教材。这里面本来没有什么奥妙，问题在于你是否眼睛向下。眼睛向下了，便会到处发现先生。“三人行，必有吾师”，何况在你周围的决不止三个人。
    当然，技术是无止境的。新的矛盾还会随着形势的发展而不断产生。徐水不会也不应当停留在这个起点。
