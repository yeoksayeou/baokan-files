    Three-Level Leap!
    Qiu Yang
    Tonight, the play ended late, and there was not a soul on the long street. A few drops of water floated towards me, moist and warm. Perhaps it was the first spring rain since the beginning of spring. I wonder how many millions of seedlings that have been gestating for a long time will break ground because of it? Perhaps green buds will already be visible on the branches tomorrow morning? It seems as if I can already hear the clamor of all things growing vigorously, and I am reminded of my life these past few days.
    Life often makes the rich vocabulary left by our ancestors seem inadequate. I don't quite know what appropriate words to use to describe the life of our theater—the Beijing People's Art Theater—these days. Rapidly changing? Lacking that joyful mood. Advancing bravely? Difficult to encompass that broad vitality. It is a leap forward, but it is more than just a little. How can I put it? It is a three-level leap!—and it carries so much confidence and strength.
    At the beginning of the year, we were still congratulating ourselves on having exceeded the target of 500 performances last year. Half a month ago, the task of 700 performances also made everyone excited. These past few days, 950 performances have already been taken out as official good news. But under a big-character poster titled "1200 Performances," more and more people are signing their names...
    Last year, we asked the state for 120,000 yuan. According to the original plan, we would still have to subsidize some until 1962. Half a month ago, the goal of self-sufficiency this year made everyone willing to try their best to achieve it. But these past few days, after calculating the detailed accounts, we can also turn in some profit to the state. First 20,000, then 40,000, 50,000, and now it is 50,000 plus more...
    And how many sealed creative treasures has this east wind blown open? People are surprised to discover that they and those around them still possess so much creative talent! These words are even more fitting. A week ago, when I saw in the newspaper that the Shanghai People's Art Theater was going to produce eighty-odd creations in a year (please forgive me, comrades in Shanghai, I am talking about a week ago, not now), some people admired it and some people were stunned. But two days later, as soon as the leadership said less than five minutes backstage, more than thirty scripts were already poking their heads out. That night, figures were shaking in every window. The next afternoon, Comrade Shu Xiuwen, at a meeting convened by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, revealed the bottom line on behalf of the theater: a total of 220 creations this year. In the evening, I met a comrade in charge of registration backstage, with a mysterious smile on his face. I asked him how it was going, but he just smiled without answering. When I pressed him, he whispered: "It's up, more than 300." Yesterday, as soon as I entered backstage, I ran into him again. Probably unable to restrain himself, he shouted without waiting for me to ask: "450 already!" This morning we sent this good news to the creative conference at the Federation of Literary and Art Circles building. As soon as we said it, we did it. Some people made public scripts that they had written long ago but were too shy to take out. Some people will submit their manuscripts in March. There are so many themes, realistic, classical, Chinese, foreign, all complete. Cao Xueqin, Guan Hanqing, Henry Fielding... It seems that they all have the possibility of appearing on theater billboards!
    I think there is no need to embellish the words any further, right? These situations, these numbers, are they not poetry?! The problem is that I dare not put down my pen here. The lights are still shining brightly in the room across the street. Someone is still muttering incessantly. Maybe tomorrow these numbers of mine will already be conservative!?

    三级跃！
    丘扬
    今夜，戏散的晚，长街寂无一人，迎面飘来几滴水花，滋润而温暖，也许竟是入春来的第一次春雨吧，不知多少孕育已久的万千幼苗，将因之破土而出，明晨枝头也许已见绿绽？仿佛已听到万物茁长的喧闹声，我联想到这几天来的生活。
    生活常常使得先人们留下的丰富辞汇感到不够用，我就不大知道该用什么恰当的词句来形容我们剧院——北京人民艺术剧院这些天的生活，瞬息万变？短少那种欢快的情绪；奋勇前进？难于概括那种广泛的生机；是跃进，但又不止于一点，怎么说呢？是三级跃！——而且还带有那么大的信心和力量。
    年初，我们还自喜于去年超额完成了五百场的演出任务；半个月前，七百场的任务也曾使大家兴奋；这几天来，九百五十场已被当做正式的喜报拿出去了；但，一张题为“一千二百场”的大字报底下正有越来越多的人在签名……
    去年，向国家要了十二万元，按原来打算，到1962年还得贴补些，半个月前，本年自给自足的目标使得大家愿赴全力去争取，但这几天，算了算细账，还可以上缴些，初而二万，继之四万，五万，如今是五万又多了……
    而这阵东风又吹开了多少密封着的创作宝藏啊？人们惊喜地发现着自己和周围还蕴育着那么多的创作才能！这话就更近了些，一星期前看到报纸上登着上海人民艺术剧院一年要搞八十几个创作的时候（请上海的同志原谅，我说的是一星期前，不是现在），有人赞叹也有人发怔，可过了两天，领导上刚在后台说了不到五分钟，已经有三十几个剧本在露头了，那一夜，各个窗口都晃动着人影，第二天下午，舒绣文同志在北京市委宣传部召集的大会上，代表剧院透了个底，本年共搞二百二十个创作，晚上，在后台遇到了管登记的一位同志，一脸神秘的笑容，问他怎么样，笑而不答，急了，才悄悄地告诉：“涨了，三百多了”，昨天，刚进后台，迎面又遇到他，大概是控制不住自己了，没等问，就大喊：“四百五十个了！”今天早上我们把这个喜报送进了文联大楼的创作大会。说干就干，有的把过去早就写好因为怕羞而不肯拿出来的剧本公开了；有的3月份里就交稿；题材又那么多，现实的、古典的、中国的、外国的俱全，曹雪芹、关汉卿、亨利、菲尔丁……看来都有出现在剧场广告牌上的可能！
    我想，毋须再怎么修饰文词了吧，这些情况、数字，难道算不得是诗！？问题是我不敢就此搁笔，对面房中犹自灯光辉煌，有人在叽哝不休，明天也许我这数字又已保守了！？
