    Holiday Long-Distance Calls
    Half Price Starting April 1st
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) From April 1st, long-distance calls made on Sundays and statutory holidays will be charged at half price.
    The half-price long-distance call policy to provincial capitals on Sundays and statutory holidays, which began on February 17th of this year, has been welcomed by all sectors. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has now decided, starting from April 1st, to remove the restriction of only applying to provincial capitals. As long as it is Sunday or a statutory holiday, general long-distance calls and conference, notification, and reservation calls to all regions (except Lhasa) will be charged at half price. Only telephone paging services, due to conditional restrictions, will still be charged at full price from 8:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next day.
