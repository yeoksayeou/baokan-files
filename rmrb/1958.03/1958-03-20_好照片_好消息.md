Good Photos, Good News
    孔桑
    Here is a photo and a small piece of news. Both the photo and the news are good. What makes them good? They are good because the photo and the news are filled with communist ideology and communist sentiment.

    Look how straightforward and enthusiastic they are! A short letter came from outside Shanhaiguan, hesitantly asking: "Can we exchange experiences with you?" The comrades in Beijing immediately reached out and shouted: "Welcome!" The workshop has just created a new record. Although the two factories are only two hours apart by train, the comrades in Shixian couldn't wait to take the train or write a letter. They immediately picked up the long-distance phone and told Kaishantun about their experience.

    Why is this? Because the factory belongs to all of us, and new technologies, new products, and new experiences belong to all of us. It is good that Beijing ink has caught up with "Parker." However, wouldn't it be better to have all the ink in the country catch up with and surpass "Parker," so that all the people in the country can use the best ink in the world? It is good that Shixian has created a world record. However, wouldn't it be better to have all the paper mills in the country climb to the top of the world, so that the people of the country have more paper to print books and newspapers? The comrades of the Beijing Ink Factory and the Shixian Paper Mill always keep the motherland and the people in mind, and their actions are naturally filled with the spirit of communism.

    好照片　好消息
    孔桑
    这里登了一张照片和一条小消息。照片好，消息也好。好在哪里呢？好在照片里，消息里，充满着共产主义思想，共产主义感情。
    你看，他们多么直爽，多么热情！山海关外寄来一封短简，犹疑地问：“能不能同你们交流经验？”北京的同志马上伸出双手，喊道：“欢迎你们！”车间里刚刚创造出新纪录，虽然两厂相隔不过两小时火车的路程，石岘的同志们却等不及坐车，也等不及写信，马上拿起长途电话，把自己的经验告诉给开山屯。
    这是为什么？因为工厂是我们大伙的，新技术、新产品、新经验，都是我们大伙的。北京墨水赶上了“派克”，当然好。然而，让全国所有的墨水都赶上和超过“派克”，让全国人民都使用世界上最好的墨水，那岂不更好？石岘创造了世界纪录，好。然而，让全国所有造纸厂都跨上世界的顶峰，让全国人民有更多的纸来印书印报，那岂不更好？北京墨水厂和石岘造纸厂的同志们时时记着祖国，记着人民，他们的行动就自然而然地充满了共产主义的精神。
