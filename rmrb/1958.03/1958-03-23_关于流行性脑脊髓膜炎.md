    About Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis
    Our earliest medical book, "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine," says: "In the third month of spring, this is called the time of development," "Heaven and earth are both born, and all things prosper." Among these myriad things are various germs. Epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis is most rampant in these three months of spring. It is an infectious disease caused by diplococcus. Those who get the disease are mostly adolescents and young people. The disease develops rapidly and violently. In the early stage, there are symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. After about two or three days, it develops into bacteremia or sepsis, and finally invades the meninges to form acute suppurative inflammation. Symptoms generally include fever, chills, headache, vomiting, stiff neck, and purplish rash on the skin. In severe cases, there may be opisthotonos, convulsions, and coma. This disease can be completely cured in the early stage, but the mortality rate is very high in severe cases, and there are often sequelae after recovery.
    This disease was prevalent in Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the epidemic in England from 1854 to 1903, 10,259 people were infected, and 5,883 died. Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been continuous regional epidemics in our country. There was even a trend of epidemic last year, but it did not spread due to the joint prevention efforts of the health department and the masses.
    This disease is transmitted through the respiratory tract. According to surveys, in the epidemic season, there are often five "carriers" of this disease in every hundred people. A "carrier" is someone who carries the germ in their throat without getting sick themselves. The reason they don't get sick is because they have strong resistance. But they are also unable to eliminate the germs, so when they cough or sneeze, they will spread the germs to others. Of course, they will also get sick when their resistance decreases. Taking one hundred people as an example, if the number of "carriers" increases from five to twenty, it will cause an epidemic of this disease.
    The main method to prevent this disease is to block the transmission route of the disease, so we must: (1) Wear masks in crowded places. Be sure to cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and do not spit or blow your nose everywhere. (2) Housing should be ventilated regularly.
    (3) Maintain a reasonable life and engage in regular physical exercise to enhance physical resistance. (4) Patients should be isolated and treated immediately, the surrounding area should be disinfected, and those who have been in contact with the patient should take some anti-inflammatory pills.
    The diplococcus that causes this disease is a relatively fragile germ, afraid of cold, heat, and dryness. It will be eliminated after being exposed to the sun for a few hours. Therefore, as long as everyone pays attention, we can completely prevent this disease from spreading.

    关于流行性脑脊髓膜炎
    我国最早一部医书“黄帝内经”上说：“春三月，此谓发陈”，“天地俱生，万物以荣”。这万物中，是包括着各种病菌的。流行性脑脊髓膜炎在这春三月，就最猖獗。它是一种双球菌引起的传染病。得病的人，青、少年最多。病势来得急而烈。初期有上呼吸道感染症状，约经二、三日，演变成菌血症或败血症，最后侵入脑脊髓膜成急性化脓性炎症。症状一般有发烧寒战、头痛、呕吐、颈强直、皮肤上出现紫疹，严重的还有角弓反张、抽搐、昏迷等。这病早期完全有治愈希望，但症状严重的死亡率很大，而且愈后也往往有后遗症。
    这病在十九世纪和二十世纪初，曾不断流行于欧洲。1854到1903年在英国流行中，有一万零二百五十九人得病，死了五千八百八十三人。我国从二十世纪初以来，也曾不断有地区性的流行。去年还曾一度有流行趋势，在卫生部门和群众协力防止下，才没有流行起来。
    这病是从呼吸道传染的。据调查，在流行季节里，一百个人中常有五个这病的“带菌者”。所谓“带菌者”，是自己不病而在嗓子里带着这种病菌，他所以自己不发病是因为抵抗力强。但他也无力消灭病菌，因此他一咳嗽或一喷嚏，就会把病菌射给别人。他自己抵抗力降低的时候，当然也会发病。仍以一百人为例，“带菌者”如果从五个增加到二十人，那就会引起这病的流行了。
    预防这病的方法，主要是堵塞这病的传播途径，所以要：（一）人多的地方，要带口罩。咳嗽、打喷嚏一定要掩住口鼻，不随地吐痰、擤鼻涕。（二）住房要经常通风。
  （三）要合理的生活和经常进行体育锻炼，增强身体抵抗力。（四）发现病人应立即隔离和治疗，附近地方要消毒，接触过的人要服些消炎片。
    引起这病的双球菌是一种比较脆弱的病菌，怕冷、怕热、怕干燥，在太阳里晒上几小时就会被消灭。所以只要我们人人注意，是完全可以不叫这病流行的。
