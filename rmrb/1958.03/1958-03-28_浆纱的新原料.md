    New Raw Material for Yarn Sizing
    The joint state-private Gongnong Chemical Factory in Santai County, Sichuan Province, has recently successfully trial-produced a type of sodium silicate that can replace flour for yarn sizing. This sodium silicate has been widely used in the hand-weaving industry in the urban areas of Santai County and Suining County. The Suining Prefectural Industrial Bureau has decided to widely adopt it in the hand-weaving industry throughout the region. Preliminary estimates indicate that using sodium silicate for yarn sizing this year in just the four counties of Santai, Suining, Zhongjiang, and Shehong will save 450,000 jin of flour.

    浆纱的新原料
    四川省三台县公私合营工农化工厂，最近试制成功一种可以代替面粉浆纱的硅酸钠。这种硅酸钠已经在三台县城区和遂宁县城区手工纺织业中普遍使用。遂宁专署工业局决定在全区手工纺织业中普遍采用。初步估计：仅三台、遂宁、中江、射洪四个县今年采用硅酸钠浆纱，就可节省面粉四十五万斤。
