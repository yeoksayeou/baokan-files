Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 23rd: The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government issued a call to the people of the whole country on the 23rd to launch a thrift campaign, requiring everyone to implement the spirit of thrift in their work and daily life.

The call pointed out that the great significance of thrift lies in accelerating the development of the national economy, consolidating the existing living standards, and laying the foundation for further improving living standards.

Hungary achieved considerable results last year by practicing streamlining and thrift, and the number of personnel in state organs has been reduced by 20,000. Since the beginning of this year, many factories have successively launched campaigns to protect socialist public property.

In its call, the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government requested factories and enterprises to pay more attention to saving raw materials, especially imported raw materials, utilizing waste products, saving electricity, strictly enforcing labor discipline, and simplifying administrative organs. It also called on agricultural workers to cherish public property and promote advanced farming and animal husbandry methods.
