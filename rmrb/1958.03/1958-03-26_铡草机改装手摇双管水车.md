Chaff Cutter Converted to Hand-Cranked Double-Tube Water Wheel
    Using an old chaff cutter frame as two large wheels, two sets of small five-wheel water wheel chains and pipes, and one axle instead of two water wheels. The large wheel of the chaff cutter is used to drive the water wheel to lift water.
    Suitable for use in wells, canals, and pits. Two people operating it can pump 15 to 18 tons of water per hour, and irrigate 4 to 6 mu of land per day, which is 1 to 3 mu more than the Liberation-style water wheel.
    Each unit costs about 20 yuan (only calculating the depreciation of the water wheel, chain, pipe, and water scoop). (Attached picture)

    铡草机改装手摇双管水车
    交河县南庄农业社南荣林；吴桥刘万祥制造。
    用旧铡草机架子一个代两个大轮，用两个小五轮水车链子、管子各二付，轴一根代水轮二个。利用铡草机大轮带动水轮提水。
    适合于水井、渠道、坑塘使用。两人操作每小时可抽水十五到十八吨，每日能浇地四到六亩，比解放式水车多浇一到三亩。
    每台需二十元左右（只算带水轮、链子、管子、水簸箕的折价）。（附图片）
