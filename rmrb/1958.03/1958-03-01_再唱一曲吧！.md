    Let's Sing Another Song!
    He Beiren
    Facing the socialist spring, writers and poets have sung the praises of the season, composing many spring songs. Comrade Ba Jin, with full enthusiasm, took the lead in welcoming the spring, singing the first song on the day of the Beginning of Spring. Readers of the People's Daily supplement that day immediately reacted by saying, "Today's newspaper is full of the breath of spring." One after another, people continued to sing, and on the Spring Festival day, the grand chorus of writers and poets brought the welcoming spring song to a climax. The welcoming spring song, with its high-pitched tune and enthusiastic emotions, often made people eager to move and inspired them to rise up and welcome the spring. I was prompted several times to think: How should we welcome this great spring?
    On the Spring Festival day, an invitation card gave me a lot of inspiration. It was a friend's playful creation. Before the Spring Festival, I had agreed with him to visit his home to celebrate the festival on the Spring Festival day. This friend, knowing my weakness of easily breaking promises, specially prepared a red paper on "New Year's Eve," using our inherent national form, and wrote that I was respectfully welcomed to my humble abode on the Spring Festival, followed by ××× with a bow. The meaning was to urge me not to break my promise.
    So I thought, "welcoming" actually has two ways of welcoming. One is this "respectfully welcoming to my humble abode"; the other is "catching up head-on." The former is waiting for "patronage," at most welcoming to the door and bringing home. In ancient times, there was a custom of welcoming thirty miles outside the city, but it was still the former kind of welcoming back. The latter way of welcoming requires stepping forward, striving to advance, and constantly surpassing things that have already advanced, walking ahead of them; only this kind of "catching up" can be regarded as "head-on." What we are now vigorously advocating is this kind of "striving for the upstream," and our goal of catching up with or surpassing Britain is also this kind. Otherwise, even if we closely follow behind, it can only be regarded as following.
    Today, we will never stop at "respectfully welcoming to my humble abode" anymore. The singers of the welcoming spring song are also galloping on the road of "catching up head-on." However, to achieve "catching up head-on," we must take even bigger steps. Take "the best poems" for example. Under the leadership of the Party, the working people personally created this socialist spring, and then turned it into a song of spring. Comrade Xiao San, with great enthusiasm, organized and compiled it, praising it as "the best poems" to share with readers. This is very good. However, compared with the people who created the spring and first sang the song of spring, our writers and poets still belong to those who follow behind. To "catch up," we need to make a greater effort and have a great leap forward! As Comrade Xiao San said: "At this time, how many beautiful songs are being sung and how many magnificent poems are being written all over the country! These are all the best poems! Poets, read more of these poems, go and mingle with the people, and write such good poems!" I think that poets and writers should join the ranks of the working people and work with their hands to add color to this spring. This is to throw oneself into the upsurge and personally stir up a wave. This is truly a good poem.
    I fervently hope that our writers and poets will also "strive for the upstream," go to real life to live, fight, learn, and create, reflect the upsurge on various fronts, and portray the heroic figures of our time. We are waiting to hear a magnificent and resounding "Leap Forward Song" after listening to the passionately surging "Welcoming Spring Song"! Here, I sincerely wish our poets and writers a bumper harvest.

    再唱一曲吧！
    何北仁
    迎着社会主义的春天，作家和诗人们鼓腹讴歌，唱了不少迎春曲。巴金同志以满腔热情担当了迎春班头，在立春那天，领唱了第一曲。读过那天人民日报副刊的人们，立即就反应说：“今天的报纸充满了春的气息”。接二连三的有人唱下来，春节这一天，作家、诗人们的大合唱，使迎春曲达到了高潮。迎春曲，调子是高吭的，情绪是热烈的，读后每每使人跃跃欲动，被促要奋起去迎春。我就曾因此几番想到：应该怎样去迎接这大好春天呢？
    春节那天，一张请帖给了我不少启发。这是一个朋友的玩笑之作。春节前我曾同他约定，春节那天去他家贺节。这个朋友，知道我有一个容易失约的缺点，便特意在“除夕”那天，弄了一张红纸，用我们固有的民族形式，写了春节谨于寒舍恭迎大驾光临，下面还有×××鞠躬字样。这意思是促我不要失约的。
    于是我想到，“迎”本也有两种迎法的。一便是这“于寒舍恭迎”；另一种却是“迎头赶上”。前一种是等候“光临”，最多也不过迎至门口，接回家里而已。古时候有郊迎三十里的，也还是迎回来的这一种。后一种迎法却要挺身而出，奋发前进，一直赶过已经前进的事物，走在它的前面；这种“赶上”也才能算得上是“迎头”。我们现在大力提倡的“力争上游”就是这一种，我们要赶上或赶过英国，也是这一种。否则，即使紧紧跟在后边追，也只能算是尾随而已。
    今天，我们决不会再止于“寒舍恭迎”了，迎春曲的歌唱者们，也都骋驰在“迎头赶上”的途中，然而要作到“迎头赶上”却还要迈开更大的脚步。以“最好的诗”来说吧，劳动人民在党的领导下，亲手创造了这社会主义的春天，又把这变成了春天的歌唱，诗人萧三同志以极大的热诚加以整理，誉之为“最好的诗”，以飨读者。这是很好的。但是与创造春天以及首先发出春天的歌声的人们相比较，我们的作家和诗人毕竟还属于尾随的。要“赶上”，得更努一把力，来个大跃进！正如萧三同志所说：“在这时候，全国各地正唱着多少美丽的歌，写着多少雄伟的诗！这些都是最好的诗！诗人们，多读些这样的诗吧，去和人民群众打成一片，也去写出这样的好诗来吧！”我以为，诗人和作家，要去参加劳动人民的行列动手为这春天壮色。这就是投身于高潮之中，也亲身激荡起一番浪花来。这才是真正的好诗。
    我热烈地希望我们的作家和诗人们也“力争上游”，到实际生活中去生活、战斗、学习、创作，反映各个战线上的高潮，刻划当代的英雄人物。我们等待着在听过了热情澎湃的“迎春曲”之后，再接着听一曲磅礴响亮的“跃进之歌”！这里，谨以至诚预祝我们的诗人和作家们丰收。
