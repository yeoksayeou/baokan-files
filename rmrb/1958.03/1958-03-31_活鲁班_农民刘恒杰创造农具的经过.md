    Living Lu Ban
    ——The Story of Farmer Liu Hengjie's Creation of Farm Tools
    Qu Yingrang
    In the farm tool exhibition room of the Weinan County Cultural Center in Shaanxi, there are some farm tools made of old wooden boards, wooden rafters, and scrap iron plates. They look very simple, but they are very convenient to use. These are the inventions of farmer Liu Hengjie.
    Liu Hengjie is a member of the Luo Liu Cooperative in Shuangwang Township. Before liberation, his family was very poor and could not afford livestock. He relied on his skill in repairing farm tools to exchange for the use of other people's livestock to farm his land. At that time, he often thought that if he wanted to do a good job in farming, he would have to modify the heavy farm tools to make them easier to use, saving people and effort, and saving more time to go out and do odd jobs. This way he could save some money to buy himself a calf and never have to look at the high eyebrows and low eyes of the rich. Although his idea was good, no one supported him in the old society. For example, the bamboo pipe well-drilling water extraction method he invented was successfully tested in 1948, but no one supported him, he couldn't afford the bamboo pipes, and he couldn't afford the labor, so it was never completed. After liberation, Liu Hengjie's ideals gradually came true under the leadership of the Party. In 1950, the mutual aid group to which Liu Hengjie belonged had weak livestock and could not keep up with the needs of agricultural work, especially in the summer. They had to plow the land and operate the waterwheel, and neither could be delayed. What should be done if the calf could not pull the waterwheel? At this time, Liu Hengjie put his expertise to use and tried to find a way to allow the calf to pull the waterwheel. After many experiments, he finally created a waterwheel return lever, which was very labor-saving, and a small calf could pull it along with a whooshing sound! It was praised by the masses of the whole village and rewarded by the government. Since then, his confidence in reforming old farm tools has become even higher.
    Liu Hengjie's reform of farm tools has played a great role in improving production. Although he has been praised by the government several times, the creative process has not been smooth sailing. His family complained that he was not doing farm work and liked to do idle things, and some backward people often ridiculed him, saying: "There are so many state-owned factories, and we don't have enough farm tools to use. It would be a great achievement if you could become an engineer…." When he returned from the county ironware cooperative after testing farm tools, his wife would not give him food, and some village cadres also complained that he was not producing well. However, Liu Hengjie's determination to create farm tools did not waver because he heard these incorrect words. He only knew how to provide farmers with labor-saving and time-saving production tools so that they could increase grain production on their own land. Therefore, he did not care about the sarcasm and difficulties of some people. Over the years, he has always been thinking of ways to research and create new farm tools. For example, when he was making a beam add-on device, he did not have the money to buy iron plates, so he ran to the county's Second Iron Production Cooperative and repeatedly explained the reason to the responsible comrades, asking for help. The staff of the ironware cooperative were moved by his perseverance and patience and generously agreed to his request, immediately forging two iron plates and sending them to him. He was very happy to have these two iron plates, but he was still afraid that the villagers would know and laugh at him, so he quietly walked back until late at night. Who knew that when he returned home after not eating for a day, his wife, like others, would not even give him leftovers to eat. But Liu Hengjie only wanted to make the tool he wanted to make, so he didn't bother to get angry with his wife. He grabbed a cold steamed bun, ate it while working, and stayed up until late at night, finally successfully installing the beam add-on device.
    The beam add-on device was made. It still had to be tested to see if it could be used, and if the test failed, he would be laughed at again. But the beam add-on device was something that livestock pulled, so how could a person pull it? He was afraid of disturbing people and having his secret discovered, so he had to take the tools alone in the middle of the night and carry the finished beam add-on device to the fields, where he pulled it himself for practical testing. That night, he studied alone until the roosters crowed several times, when it was almost dawn, before he successfully tested the beam add-on device. When Liu Hengjie went home, he also leveled the beams added by the beam add-on device, fearing that others would discover it and scold him for being a madman. Later, when the beam add-on device played a great role in agricultural production, everyone who had used it praised Liu Hengjie as a true living Lu Ban.
    Living facts educated the masses and his wife. When he was named a county-level labor model, he was truly overjoyed to have the honorary flower pinned on his chest. His wife no longer hindered him. Liu Hengjie was not willing to lag behind in the Great Leap Forward and continued to install the corn seed picking machine that he had already successfully tested. He also serves as the captain of the well-drilling team in the township, fighting tirelessly in the fields to fulfill the glorious task of realizing the township's water conservancy this year.

    活鲁班
    ——农民刘恒杰创造农具的经过
    屈应让
    陕西渭南县文化馆的农具展览室内，陈列着用旧木板、木椽、废铁板制成的一部分农具，看起来很简单，使起来却很方便，那就是农民刘恒杰的创造发明。
    刘恒杰是双王乡罗刘社的社员，解放前他家里很穷，买不起牲口，只凭自己修理农具的一手本事，换别人的牲口给自己种地。那时候，他曾多次的想着，要把庄稼做好就得把沉重的农具改制一下，用起来省人省力，就会节省更多的时间出外做些零工，好积余些钱给自己买一头小牛，再也不看有钱人的眉高眼低了。他这个想法虽然好，可是在旧社会是没有人支持他的。比如他制造的竹管穿井抽水法，在1948年就试验成功了，但是没有人支持他，买不起竹管，贴不起工夫，到底没有制成。解放后，刘恒杰的理想在党的领导下，逐渐实现了。1950年，刘恒杰所在的互助组，牲口弱，赶不上农活的需要，特别是一到夏天，要犁地，又要曳水车，一样也不敢耽误。小牛拉不动水车该怎么办呢？刘恒杰这时便发挥了他的特长，想办法要让小牛能拉动水车。经过多次试验，他终于创造出水车回头拉杆，非常省力，一个小牛拉上哗哗哗地走！受到了全村群众的赞扬和政府的奖励。从此他改造旧农具的信心更高了。
    刘恒杰改造农具对提高生产起了很大作用，虽然曾受到政府的几次表扬，但在创造过程中，也不是一帆风顺的。家里嫌他放着庄稼不做爱做闲事，个别落后群众还经常讽刺他说：“国家工厂那么多，还熬煎没有农具用，你积极能成个工程师才算本事大哩……。”他到县上铁业社试验农具回来，妻子不给饭吃，个别村干部还嫌他不好好生产。不过刘恒杰创造农具的决心并没有因为听到这些不正确的话头而动摇，他只知道如何让农民拿上省力省时间的生产工具，在自己的土地上多增加一些粮食。因此，他对一些人的讽刺和为难毫不在乎，几年来，总是不断地想办法研究，创造新的农具。比如他在制作加梁器时，没有钱买铁板，便跑到县上第二铁业生产合作社，多次找负责同志，反复讲明道理，请求帮助。铁业社职工们被他这种坚毅、耐心的精神所感动，慷慨地答应了他的要求，立即打了两块铁板送给他。他有了这两块铁板非常高兴，但还怕村上群众知道讥笑他，直到晚上才悄悄走回去。谁知一天没吃饭回到家里，他的妻子也和旁人一样，连剩饭也不让他吃。但刘恒杰只想做成他要做的工具，顾不得和妻子生气，顺便拿了一个冷馍，一面吃着、一面做，一直熬到深夜，终于把加梁器安装成功。
    加梁器做起来了。能不能用还得要试验，试验不成功，又要惹人笑话。可是加梁器是牲口曳的东西，人如何拉得动呢？他只怕惊动了人，被别人发现他的秘密，只好一个人深更半夜带上工具，将做好的加梁器背到田野里，自己拉着进行实际试验。这一夜，他一个人，一直研究到鸡叫几遍，天快明的时候，才把加梁器试验成功了。刘恒杰临回家时，还将加梁器加起的梁进行了平整，怕旁人发现后骂他是个疯子。后来，当加梁器在农业生产上发挥了很大作用时，凡是使用过的人，无不称赞刘恒杰真算是活鲁班。
    活的事实教育了群众和他的妻子。当他被评为全县劳动模范后，光荣花挂在胸前，可真乐坏了。他的妻子再也不阻难他了。刘恒杰在生产大跃进中，也不甘愿落于人后，继续安装他已试验成功的玉米拣种机。他还担任着全乡打管井队的队长，为实现全乡今年水利化的光荣任务而不停地在田野里战斗着。
