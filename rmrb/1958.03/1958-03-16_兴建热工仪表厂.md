Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 15th. The construction of China's first modern thermal instrument factory began in early March in Xi'an City. It is expected to be put into production in July next year.

When completed, this factory will be able to produce 150 to 200 types of thermal instruments in eight major categories. These precision instruments will not only meet the needs of China's automated production sectors—heavy industries such as chemical, petroleum, smelting, and power—but will also be supplied to support the development of man-made fiber and chemical fertilizer industries in our country.

This factory was designed with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic, and most of the main precision equipment is also supplied by the German Democratic Republic.

    兴建热工仪表厂
    新华社西安15日电　我国第一座现代化的热工仪表厂，3月上旬在西安市动工兴建，预计明年7月份就可以投入生产。
    这座工厂建成后，能生产八大类型的热工仪表一百五十到二百种。这些精密的仪表不但将供给我国自动化生产部门——化工、石油、冶炼和电力等重工业部门的需要，还将配合供应我国发展人造纤维和化学肥料工业所需的各种热力仪表。
    这个工厂是由民主德国帮助我国设计的，主要精密设备大部也由民主德国供应。
