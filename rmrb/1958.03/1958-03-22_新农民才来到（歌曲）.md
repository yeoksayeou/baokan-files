    New Farmers Have Arrived
    [Song Instructions]
    This song can strengthen the self-education of cadres sent to lower levels and enhance the unity of new and old commune members. It can be sung when cadres are first sent to the countryside or at general rural cultural performances. Drums and gongs can be used for accompaniment during the performance. A round of drums and gongs can be played before the first, second, and third verses, and the piece can conclude with drums and gongs. The phrases with multiple notes on a single syllable in the fifth and sixth measures should be sung fluently and clearly, conveying a cheerful and excited mood. The "Monologue" represents the words of the villagers, and the tone should be bright and friendly, not stiff or cold. "The agricultural cooperative is our good school" is best sung in one breath. If that’s not possible, the breath should be taken subtly, especially at 56|2—|2—|, which should be sung with enthusiasm and full volume to demonstrate love for the agricultural cooperative (the same applies to the other two verses of this musical phrase).

    新农民才来到
   〔歌曲说明〕
    这首歌曲一方面可以加强下放干部的自我教育，同时也可以增进新老社员的团结。在下放干部刚到农村时或在农村的一般文艺晚会都可以演唱。演唱时可用锣鼓伴奏，一、二、三段前都可打一番锣鼓，最后也以锣鼓结束；第五、六小节一字数音处要唱得流利清晰，有欢快兴奋的情绪；“独白”是老乡的话，口气要显得爽朗和亲切，不要生硬或冷淡，“农业社就是我们的好学堂”最好一口气唱完，即使不能，中间换气也要不露痕迹，尤其是56|2—|2—|处要充满热情，音量饱满，才显得对农业社的热爱（这一乐句的其它两段词也同样处理）。
