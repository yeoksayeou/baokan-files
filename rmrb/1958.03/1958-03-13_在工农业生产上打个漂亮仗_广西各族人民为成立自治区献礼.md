Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 12th: The people of all nationalities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are determined to put on a beautiful performance in industrial and agricultural production this year as a gift for the first year of the Autonomous Region's establishment. This was the determination expressed by representatives of all nationalities at the First Session of the First People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in their speeches.

The representatives unanimously stated that they were confident in achieving the goal of surpassing the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries with the total output value of local industries in the Autonomous Region within six years. The industrial development plan proposed by the Baise Prefecture representatives is: to increase the total industrial output value by one time compared to last year. Baise has good reserves of lignite, gold, scheelite, sulfur, cinnabar, gypsum, antimony, and other minerals. This year, they will build a new scheelite plant, a cinnabar mine, and two gypsum mines, and also extract 500 kilograms of gold. According to the representatives' speeches at the meeting, the total output value of local industries in Liuzhou City will also increase by 70.53% compared to last year, and they will expand the trial production of more than 27 new products. The Wuzhou Rosin Factory, whose rosin quality reaches international standards, has decided to increase its rosin production by 4,000 tons this year. Production quotas in many factories have been repeatedly exceeded. Nanning City, the capital of the Autonomous Region, has decided to transform into an industrial city within three years and increase its industrial output value tenfold within five years.

In order to tap the rich resources of the Autonomous Region's tropical and subtropical agricultural and forestry treasures, the Autonomous Region will establish approximately 130 agricultural product processing plants during the Second Five-Year Plan, including sugar factories, citronella oil distilleries, degummed ramie refining factories, rubber factories, and coffee factories.

The information gathered at the First Session of the First People's Congress of the Autonomous Region shows that the water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and afforestation movements are continuously underway throughout the region. The water conservancy projects that have started construction throughout the region can irrigate more than 12 million mu of farmland, and the amount of work completed so far has reached more than 70%. The water conservancy projects built in a few months are more than the total sum of all water conservancy facilities in the entire Guangxi region from the Qin Dynasty to the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Laibin, Guiping, and Guixian, historically known as particularly drought-prone counties, are striving to basically eliminate drought disasters in all paddy fields this year. In many places, the task of accumulating fertilizer has been overfulfilled in a few days and nights. In the afforestation movement, people of all nationalities do not calculate the progress of the movement in days, but in hours. Counties such as Luocheng, Hechi, and Sanjiang have completed their annual afforestation tasks within 48 hours.

"People doing things that have never been done in thousands of years, doing things that have never been done in thousands of years" is an inspiring slogan shouted by people of all nationalities in the Autonomous Region. Many counties have proposed to double or even triple their increased production targets for this year, and more than a dozen counties are striving to become "thousand-catty counties" this year, while some are aiming for 800 catties openly and 1,000 catties secretly.

Many representatives also excitedly talked about in their speeches: Three new things have emerged in the rural areas of the Autonomous Region this year – a new upsurge, a new look, and a new atmosphere. In the Zhuang-populated areas of Luzhai County, Zhuang cadres and the masses are determined to have toilets for people, pigsties for pigs, and nests for chickens and ducks in the first half of this year, to carry out a major reform of customs and habits that have existed for thousands of years, and to ensure the accumulation of more than 200 dan of fertilizer per mu. In the past, the Mulam people of Luocheng County had the habit of burning incense from the first day to the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year, and not going out or moving soil on the first day. This year, more than 60,000 people in the county spent the Lunar New Year on construction sites. The local people call this year's Lunar New Year the "Year of Unity," the "Year of Thrift," and the "Year of Victory."

    在工农业生产上打个漂亮仗
    广西各族人民为成立自治区献礼
    据新华社南宁12日电　广西僮族自治区各族人民今年要在工农业生产上打一个漂亮仗，作为自治区成立第一年的献礼。这是广西僮族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，各族人民代表发言中所表示的决心。
    代表们一致表示他们有信心提前实现六年内使自治区地方工业总产值越过农副业总产值的指标。百色专区代表提出的工业发展规划是：今年工业总产值要比去年增长一倍。百色境内有很好的褐煤、黄金、白钨、硫磺、朱砂、石膏、锑等矿藏，今年就要新建一个白钨厂、一个朱砂矿和两个石膏矿，还要开采黄金五百公斤。根据代表们在会上的发言，柳州市地方工业的总产值，今年也将比去年增长70.53％，并且要扩大试制二十七种以上的新产品。松香质量达到国际水平的梧州松脂厂，决定今年增产松香四千吨。许多厂的生产定额一再被突破。自治区首府的南宁市，已决定在三年内变为工业城市，并在五年内使工业产值增长十倍。
    为了挖掘自治区热带、亚热带农林宝库的丰富资源，自治区在第二个五年计划内将建立糖厂、香茅油蒸厂、苎麻脱胶精洗厂、橡胶厂、咖啡厂等约一百三十个农产品加工厂。
    自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上汇集的情况表明，水利、积肥、造林运动正在全区持续不断地进行。全区已开工的水利工程，可以灌溉田地一千二百多万亩，目前已完成的工作量达到70％以上。几个月兴修的水利就比广西全区自秦朝到国民党反动统治时期全部水利设施的总和还多。在历史上称为特旱县的来宾、桂平、贵县等，今年争取基本消灭全部水田的旱灾。许多地方的积肥任务，在几个昼夜内就超额完成。各族人民在造林运动中，不是用天数来计算运动的进展，而是用多少小时来计算，罗城、河池、三江等县都在四十八个小时内，完成了全年的造林任务。
    “千古以来没有过的人，干千古以来没有干过的事”，这是自治区各族人民喊出的一个振奋人心的口号。许多县提出今年的增产指标都是翻上加翻，已经有十多个县要在今年争取成为千斤县，还有一些是明夺八百，暗取一千。
    许多代表在发言中还兴奋地谈到：在自治区农村里，今年出现了三新——新高潮、新面貌、新气象。在鹿寨县的僮族聚居地区，僮族干部和群众决心在今年上半年做到人有厕、猪有圈、鸡鸭有窝，来一个千百年来风俗习惯的大改革，保证每亩积肥二百担以上。罗城县仫佬族人民过去的习惯过春节要从初一烧香到十五，初一不出门、不动土。今年全县有六万多人在工地上过年，当地人民把今年的春节叫做“团结年”、“节约年”、“胜利年”。
