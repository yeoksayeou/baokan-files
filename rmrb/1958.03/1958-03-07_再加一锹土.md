    Add Another Shovel of Soil
  (Quick Sketch of the Life of a Transferred Cadre)
    Sister-in-law,
    Add another shovel of soil!
    It's not like when we first arrived,
    Don't feel so sorry for us anymore.
    Sister-in-law, add another shovel of soil!
    It's not like when we first arrived,
    We can carry a hundred catties now.

    再加一锹土
  （下放干部生活速写）
    大嫂子，
    再加一锹土吧！
    如今不比刚来，
    不要老疼我们。
    大嫂子，再加一锹土吧！
    如今不比刚来，
    足足能挑百把斤。
