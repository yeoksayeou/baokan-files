    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, New York Dispatch: Constant fear for the future has become an inescapable nightmare for American workers.

    A steel mill worker in Fontana, California, told a reporter from the union newspaper "Labor Daily": "We are constantly in a state of nervous tension. When you walk in the door, the first thing your wife wants to know is: do you still have a job?"

    It is no accident that American workers and their families feel apprehensive all day long. Currently, there are more than 5.2 million people completely unemployed in the United States, and more than 3 million are underemployed, only working two or three days a week. And once they lose their jobs, they lose almost everything.

    A dispatch from Ansonia, Connecticut, published in the "New York Herald Tribune," described the plight of an unemployed worker, formerly employed by "Goodyear," who has five children. After being laid off from the factory, he couldn't afford to pay the rent, and his electricity was cut off. For several days, his family didn't even have a piece of bread.

    时刻受着失业和饥饿的威胁
    美国工人生活朝不保夕
    据新华社13日讯  纽约消息：对明天经常感到恐惧已经成为美国工人摆脱不掉的梦魇。
    加利福尼亚州枫檀纳市冶金工厂一位工人对工会报纸“劳工日报”记者说：“我们经常处在神经紧张状态中。当你一进屋子，妻子赶紧要知道的头一件事就是：你是不是还有工作。”
    美国的工人和他们的家属整天感到提心吊胆，这并不是偶然的。现在，美国已经有五百二十多万人完全失业，还有三百多万人半失业，他们一星期只能做两、三天工。而一失业，他们就几乎失去一切。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”刊载的一篇安苏尼亚（康?狄格州）通讯谈到了一个失业工人的处境，这个工人从前是“固特立”公司的工人，有五个孩子。在被工厂解雇后，他没有钱付房租，电线也被切断了。有几天，他家里连一块面包也没有。
