    The Dipper Returns to Yin, Another Spring
    Yang Min
    In the northern sky, there are seven bright stars. Four of them form an irregular quadrilateral, like the body of an iron used for ironing clothes in ancient times, or like the scoop part of a ladle for scooping water. The other three are curved and connected to one corner of the dipper, forming the handle of the iron or ladle. Therefore, people gave these seven stars the name "Big Dipper," also abbreviated as "Dipper." If you imagine connecting the two stars at the front of the Dipper with a straight line and extend it upwards, about five times the length of this line, you can see a dimmer star, which is the "North Star." The North Star is generally stationary, but the Big Dipper rotates around the North Star counterclockwise, day and night, but the position of the Dipper changes with the seasons. The book "He Guanzi" states: "When the handle of the Dipper points east, the world is in spring; when the handle of the Dipper points south, the world is in summer; when the handle of the Dipper points west, the world is in autumn; when the handle of the Dipper points north, the world is in winter." Now it is spring, so every evening, the handle of the Dipper points to the east of the North Star.
      The poem "The Dipper Returns to Yin, Another Spring" clearly tells us that the Big Dipper rotates around the North Star once every year. However, due to the Earth's rotation, it appears to us that the Big Dipper revolves around the North Star once every 24 hours. So, on any given day, the position of the Dipper varies depending on the time. If we can remember the initial position of the Big Dipper in the early evening of each season (preferably each month), then, based on the degree to which the handle of the Dipper deviates from the initial position, we can deduce the time of day. Therefore, the Big Dipper is essentially an automatic and luminous large clock. The North Star faintly indicates the center of the clock face, and the handle of the Dipper is the hand of this clock. Since the Big Dipper revolves around the North Star once every 24 hours, every time it rotates fifteen degrees, one hour has passed.

    斗柄回寅又一春
    杨旻
    在北方的天际，有七颗亮晶晶的星星。其中四颗组成一个不规则的四方形，就像古时熨衣服用的熨斗的斗身，也像挹水用的杓子的杓部。另外三颗弯弯的接在斗的一个角上，形成了熨斗或杓子的柄。因此，人们就给这七颗星星起了“北斗七星”的名称，也简称它为“北斗”。如果把斗前边的两颗星在想像中联成一条直线，并向上延长，大约在五倍这直线的地方，可以看到一颗较暗的星，那就是“北极星”。北极星大体上是不动的，北斗星却沿着反时针方向，日以继夜地围绕着北极星旋转，但时节不同，北斗的位置也随着变化。“鶡冠子”一书上载：“斗柄指东，天下皆春；斗柄指南，天下皆夏；斗柄指西，天下皆秋；斗柄指北，天下皆冬。”现在是春天，所以每到黄昏前后，斗柄是向着北极星的东边指着的。
      “斗柄回寅又一春”这句诗很明显地告诉我们：北斗星每过一年，就围绕着北极星旋转一次。但是由于地球的自转，在我们看起来，北斗星还一昼夜绕北极星一周。所以就一天来说，时候不同，北斗的位置也不一样。如果我们能够记住北斗星在各个季节（最好是各个月份）的黄昏时分的最初位置，那么，根据斗柄离开最初位置的度数，就可以推知当时的时刻了。所以北斗星无异就是一个自动而发光的大挂钟。北极星隐隐约约，指示我们这个钟的钟面中心所在，而北斗的斗柄，便是这钟的指针。由于北斗星一昼夜绕北极星一周，所以它每转过十五度，时间就过去了一点钟。
