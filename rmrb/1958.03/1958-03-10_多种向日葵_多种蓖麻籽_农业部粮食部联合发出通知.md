Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food jointly issued a notice on planting sunflowers and castor seeds on the 5th.

The notice requires the agricultural (forestry) departments and food departments (bureaus) of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to utilize saline-alkali wasteland in a planned way to develop oil-use sunflowers in large areas and to plant castor seeds according to local conditions. It also strongly calls on urban and rural residents, schools, institutions, organizations, enterprises, and troops to make full use of all available vacant land to plant at least five to ten plants per person. At the same time, through in-depth publicity, a nationwide planting campaign should be launched. Agricultural and food departments at all levels should first fully utilize all vacant land in their offices, dormitories, and affiliated processing plants, warehouses, schools, research institutions, etc., to plant large quantities; in areas with suitable conditions, they can use cadres' voluntary labor to plant a portion of castor seeds and sunflowers in other experimental fields.

The notice requires food and agriculture departments at all levels to immediately cooperate with relevant departments under the unified leadership of the local Party committees to study and formulate production plans for developing sunflowers and castor seeds by utilizing saline-alkali wasteland and all available vacant land, in accordance with local conditions. The notice also put forward opinions on seed allocation and oil procurement work. In concentrated production areas, especially in concentrated castor seed production areas where the output of main edible oil is low, the quantity of edible oil supply should be appropriately considered based on the principle of encouraging production and stimulating sales. Procurement methods should be diverse to facilitate mass sales as much as possible. The purchase price of sunflower seeds and castor seeds must implement the policy of high quality and high price, and pricing according to quality. If the oil content of oil-use seeds and edible seeds is different, the purchase price of oil-use seeds should be higher than that of edible seeds. (Attached picture)

    多种向日葵　多种蓖麻籽
    农业部粮食部联合发出通知
    新华社讯　农业部和粮食部五日联合发出关于种植向日葵和蓖麻籽的通知。
    通知要求各省、自治区、直辖市的农业（林）厅、粮食厅（局），有计划地利用盐碱荒地成片发展油用向日葵和因地制宜地种植蓖麻籽，并大力号召城乡居民、学校、机关、团体、企业、部队等尽量利用一切空闲隙地至少每人种植五株到十株。同时，通过深入宣传，掀起一个全民性的种植运动。各级农业、粮食部门应首先充分利用自己的办公室、宿舍和所属加工厂、仓库、学校、研究机构等一切空闲地大量种植；在有条件的地区，可以利用干部的义务劳动，在其他试验田中种植一部分蓖麻籽和向日葵。
    通知要求各级粮食、农业部门在当地党委统一领导下，立即配合有关部门，因地制宜地研究制定利用盐碱荒地和一切空闲隙地发展向日葵和蓖麻籽的生产规划。对于种籽调剂和油料收购工作，通知也提出了意见。在集中产区，特别是蓖麻籽的集中产区，主要食用油的产量又少，应根据鼓励生产与刺激交售的原则，在食油供应的数量上应适当加以照顾。收购方法要多种多样，尽量作到便利群众交售。葵花籽和蓖麻籽的收购价格，必须贯彻优质优价、按质论价的政策。如油用种与食用种的含油率不同，油用种的收购价格应当高于食用种。（附图片）
