    Remembering Gorky, I Think of a Comrade-in-Arms
    Lin Ling
    Every time I commemorate Gorky, I always recall the story of a revolutionary youth who carried out revolutionary struggles for Gorky's name and eventually sacrificed gloriously.
    It happened between 1932 and 1936. Comrade Jin Jianxiao, after graduating from the Shanghai Art University with a degree in painting, returned to Harbin in Northeast China to participate in the Party's underground work—mainly drawing for the Party's secret propaganda pictorials. Because 1932 was the 40th anniversary of Gorky's writing career, Comrade Jin Jianxiao suggested that the Party's pictorials should reflect this, and he drew a portrait of Gorky.
    Comrade Jin Jianxiao had worked for a short time at the Heilongjiang Minbao, where he edited the supplement and published many progressive works. He also organized a drama troupe there and staged several plays. The Minbao supplement reprinted plays such as Ostrovsky's "The Storm" and Arita Ujaku's "Asparagus." He brought back an mimeographed copy of Gorky's "The Lower Depths" from Shanghai to Heilongjiang and had it printed. It was impossible to perform Gorky's works in the Northeast under the rule of the enemy and puppets, but Comrade Jin Jianxiao, inspired by Gorky's revolutionary spirit, had made an effort to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Gorky's revolutionary literary creation through performances.
    In the winter of 1935, Comrade Jin Jianxiao returned to Harbin and, together with several other comrades, took over the "Dabei Pictorial." The pictorial was a supplement to the Dabei Xinbao, a Chinese newspaper run by the Japanese. Under the rule of the enemy and puppets, we tried our best to use the enemy and puppet newspapers to do some revolutionary propaganda work. The "Dabei Pictorial" edited by Comrade Jin Jianxiao began publication in early 1936 and spread widely among the youth in Harbin. Around June 10th, an issue of the pictorial was already typeset and about to be printed when news suddenly came that Gorky was seriously ill. Comrade Jin Jianxiao and other members of the editorial department were very excited. Such news would never be published in the Japanese puppet newspapers, so our pictorial should report it to the readers. Therefore, it was decided to cut out a piece of the typeset page and insert a news item and a portrait of Gorky.
    After the pictorial was published, Yamamoto, the Japanese president of the newspaper, saw a "picture of a foreigner" on the pictorial. He did not recognize the person, and after repeatedly questioning, he found out that it was Gorky. He flew into a rage and asked who had used his publication to carry out "anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese" communist propaganda. A day or two later, Jin Jianxiao and several other comrades were arrested.
    Gorky passed away on June 18th, two or three days after Comrade Jin Jianxiao was imprisoned, but he could not have known this sad news in prison.
    Because Comrade Jin Jianxiao had another "case" in Heilongjiang, he was escorted from Harbin to there. Soon after, he was shot by the Japanese imperialist invaders at Lao Jiangba on the banks of the Heilongjiang River.
    Comrade Jin Jianxiao was only in his twenties when he sacrificed himself. A young man who was inspired by Gorky's name to do revolutionary work, tried his best to "commemorate Gorky" so that more young people could be inspired by Gorky, and thus sacrificed in the hands of the enemy.
    Such stories are not isolated in China. Don't we often find Gorky's works on the bodies of soldiers who gloriously sacrificed themselves during the several domestic revolutionary wars and the Anti-Japanese War?
    From this, we can also see that Gorky is a revolutionary banner. In our country, how many young people have recognized the truth of the revolution through this banner and rushed to the revolutionary battlefield! And how many revolutionary youths have fought one after another under this banner! Commemorating the 90th anniversary of Gorky's birth, recalling such stories, we will more resolutely follow the path indicated by Gorky and strive for the prospect of socialism.

    纪念高尔基想到一位战友
    林陵
    每当纪念高尔基的时候，我总要想起一位革命青年怎样为了高尔基的名字进行革命斗争和终于光荣牺牲的故事。
    那是1932—1936年间的事情。金剑啸同志从上海艺术大学学画毕业回到东北的哈尔滨，参加党的地下工作——主要是给党的秘密宣传画刊画画。因为1932年是高尔基创作四十年纪念，金剑啸同志自己建议，在党的画刊上有所表示，他画了一幅高尔基像。
    金剑啸同志曾有一个短时期在黑龙江民报工作，主编副刊，发表了不少进步作品。他还在那里组织了话剧团，演出了几个戏。在民报副刊上曾转载奥斯特罗夫斯基的“大雷雨”、秋田雨雀的“天门冬”等剧本。他曾把从上海带回的油印本高尔基的“夜店”带到黑龙江去，印了出来。在敌伪统治下的东北，要演出高尔基的作品是不可能的，但是金剑啸同志在高尔基革命精神的鼓舞之下，曾做过一番努力，争取用演出来庆祝高尔基的革命文学创作四十年。
    1935年冬，金剑啸同志回哈尔滨和另外几位同志接办“大北画刊”。画刊是大北新报的副刊，大北新报是日本人主办的汉文报纸。在敌伪统治之下，为了做一些革命宣传工作，我们曾尽可能利用敌伪报刊。金剑啸同志主编的“大北画刊”自1936年初开始出版，在哈尔滨青年中传播很广。6月10日左右，一期画刊已经排好，即将付印，突然接到高尔基病重的消息，金剑啸等编辑部同志甚为激动。这样的消息，在日伪报纸上是决不会刊登的，我们的画刊应该向读者报道，于是决定把排好的版子挖去一块，嵌进一则消息，一幅高尔基像。
    画刊出版后，报社社长日人山本看到画刊上有一个“外国人的像片”，不认识是什么人，再三追问，问明这是高尔基后，他暴跳如雷，追问何人利用他的刊物进行“反满抗日”的共产党宣传。一两天之后，金剑啸和其他几位同志被捕。
    金剑啸同志入狱后两三天，6月18日，高尔基逝世，但是他在狱中已无法得知这个悲痛的消息了。
    金剑啸同志因为在黑龙江另有“案子”，被从哈尔滨解到那里去。不久他便被日本帝国主义侵略者在黑龙江畔的老江坝枪杀了。
    金剑啸同志牺牲时还只有二十多岁。一个为高尔基的名字鼓舞着做革命工作的青年，竭力想“纪念高尔基”，让更多的青年得到高尔基的鼓舞，就这样牺牲在敌人的手里了。
    这样的故事，在中国不是个别的。我们不是常在几次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期光荣牺牲的战士身上发现高尔基的作品吗？
    从这里也可以看出高尔基是一面革命的旗帜。在我们国家里，曾经有多少青年通过这面旗帜认识了革命真理而奔向了革命战场啊！又有多少革命青年在这面旗帜之下前仆后继地进行战斗啊！纪念高尔基诞生九十周年，回忆这样的故事，我们将更坚决地走高尔基所指示的道路，为社会主义的前景奋斗。
