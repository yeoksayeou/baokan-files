Millions of Double-Share Plows Go to the Countryside
Zhejiang Universally Uses New Farm Tools to Promote New Technologies
Xinhua News Agency, March 28th—A large number of double-wheel double-share plows are being continuously transported to rural areas. This is a new development in the great leap forward in the past month. According to statistics reported by various regions to relevant departments, more than 1.03 million double-wheel double-share plows will be promoted nationwide this year.

After the Ministry of Agriculture held a Southern Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow Modification Appraisal and Promotion and Use Experience Exchange Conference in Huangyan, Zhejiang in late February, the reputation of the double-wheel double-share plow was restored. After investigation and research, many regions revised their promotion plans for the double-wheel double-share plow. Thirteen southern provinces including Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei originally planned to promote only more than 250,000 units. After the ideological and technical problems of using double-share plows in paddy fields were resolved, they now plan to promote more than 720,000 units. Fujian Province originally did not plan to promote them, but now it has jumped to planning to promote 100,000 units.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 28th—In order to win the first battle of this year's spring production, agricultural cooperatives in Zhejiang Province are universally implementing a series of advanced technical measures, such as using double-share plows, early sowing, increasing sowing volume, seed selection, and seed soaking with chemicals. In Jiaxing and Jinhua prefectures, more than 2,000 double-share plows were used to plow rice seedling fields. In Jiaokeng Township, Huangyan County, and Daqiao Township, Pinghu County, all farmland was plowed with double-share plows during spring plowing. In Ningbo, Taizhou and other regions, seed treatment must pass seven stages, including wind selection, screening, grain selection, sunning, salt water or muddy water selection, baking soda soaking, and germination. In order to prevent rice diseases, various places also disinfect the seeds and increase the sowing volume from the past 7 or 8 jin per mu to 12, 15, or 18 jin. In the northern, central, and eastern regions of Zhejiang, due to earlier sowing times, agricultural cooperative members have designed semi-dry seedling fields and frost-proof seedling fields, creating many new methods for frost prevention and insulation.

This year, more than 200,000 new farmer technicians have emerged in Zhejiang Province, and they have become an important force in promoting advanced technologies and new farm tools during spring plowing and sowing.

During spring plowing and sowing, leading departments at all levels in Zhejiang Province particularly emphasized the promotion and application of advanced technologies. Some regions have established institutions to promote advanced technologies and new farm tools, and some regions have formulated operating procedures for rice cultivation techniques. The experimental fields established by cadres at all levels also used a complete set of advanced technologies to complete early rice sowing, playing a strong role in promoting it.

    百万部双铧犁下乡
    浙江普遍使用新农具推广新技术
    据新华社28日讯　大批双轮双铧犁正源源运往农村，这是大跃进中最近一月来出现的新情况。据各地向有关部门报告的统计，今年全国共将推广一百零三万多部双轮双铧犁。
    农业部2月下旬在浙江黄岩召开南方双轮双铧犁改装评比和推广使用经验交流会以后，双轮双铧犁的名誉恢复了，很多地区经过调查研究都修订了双轮双铧犁的推广计划。广东、云南、贵州、江苏、安徽、湖南、湖北等南方十三个省原来计划只推广二十五万多部，水田地区使用双铧犁的思想问题和技术问题得到解决以后，现在计划推广七十二万多部。福建省原来不准备推广，现在一跃而计划推广十万部。
    新华社杭州28日电　浙江省各地农业社为了打好今年春季生产的第一仗，正在普遍地推行使用双铧犁、提早播种、增加播种量、选种、药剂浸种等一系列的先进技术措施。嘉兴、金华两个专区使用了两千多部双铧犁来翻耕秧田，黄岩县焦坑乡、平湖县大桥乡在春耕中全部耕田都使用双铧犁，宁波、台州等地区种子处理要过七关，就是要风选、筛选、粒选、晒种、盐水或泥水选种、小苏打浸种和催芽。为了防止水稻病害，各地还对种子进行消毒，并把播种量从过去的每亩七、八斤提高到十二、十五或十八斤。在浙江北部、中部和东部地区，由于播种时间提早，农业社社员们纷纷设计了半旱秧田和防冻秧田，创造了许多防冻保温的新方法。
    今年，浙江省又出现了二十多万名新的农民技术员，他们在春耕播种中都成为推广先进技术和新式农具的重要力量。
    在春耕播种中，浙江省各级领导部门特别强调推广和应用先进技术。有些地区成立了推广先进技术和新式农具的机构，有些地区制定了水稻栽培技术操作规程。各级干部建立的试验田也都采用整套的先进技术完成早稻播种，发挥了强有力的推动作用。
