This dispatch from Nanchang, March 18th reports that after the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call to "catch up with the value of agricultural output in seven years through local industry," it was truly "one order, a myriad arrows launched!" New factories and mines in various special districts and counties sprung up rapidly like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. As of March 8th, the province had approved the establishment of 568 factories and mines in 1958. The province's 82 counties and 7 cities are establishing on average six projects each.

In solving the difficulties of funding, technology, and equipment, various localities have adopted many creative methods. To solve funding difficulties, six main methods have been adopted: First, provincial investment and provincial management. Second, absorbing funds from large cities for joint ventures. For example, Shanghai needs copper, so it absorbs Shanghai funds to mine copper. Third, provincial investment and special county management. Fourth, special county investment with provincial subsidies. Fifth, special counties invest themselves, squeezing out financial surpluses for investment in industry. Sixth, advance investment, mainly from supply and marketing and urban service systems, allocating some funds to invest in enterprises producing products they operate themselves. In solving the difficulty of technical expertise, in addition to sending cadres to fraternal factories for internships, on-site training is also conducted. In solving equipment problems, the main measures taken are to clear out existing equipment, arrange production themselves, exchange goods with other provinces, and organize exports to earn foreign exchange.

All these methods have one common characteristic, namely self-reliance. In the past, whenever counties mentioned setting up industries, they would reach out for money and for personnel. Now, they are all actively raising funds and training cadres themselves. All special districts and counties have proposed to resolutely implement the policy of building factories diligently and thriftily, and operating factories diligently and thriftily. All factories do not build auditoriums, and factory buildings are simple and crude. Some factories have even decided not to build factory buildings at all; for example, oil pressing plants and wineries can use ancestral halls or civilian houses as factory buildings. Various localities also pay attention to implementing the principle of "local materials, local processing." All industrial projects in special counties meet the requirements of "small investment, quick returns." The average investment in all 568 projects in the province is only 40,000 yuan per project. Some factories are built, produce, recover funds, and generate profits all in the same year.

Another characteristic of Jiangxi's special county industries in implementing the policy of building factories diligently and thriftily is the full utilization of wild raw materials. For example, paper mills almost entirely use bamboo shoots, cogongrass, etc.; winemaking almost entirely uses bayberries, acorns, wild pears, chestnuts, etc. The eleven paper mills run by the cadres' reclamation farms alone, using these wild raw materials to make paper, can produce 6,500 tons of paper annually.

After all 568 factories and mines built by various special districts and counties in Jiangxi Province in 1958 are put into production, the total output value will reach approximately 150 million yuan. This will create a good start for catching up with the value of agricultural output in seven years.

### 勤俭不愁资金少　苦干那怕困难多  江西地方工业万箭齐发

    勤俭不愁资金少　苦干那怕困难多
    江西地方工业万箭齐发
    本报南昌18日电　中共江西省委提出“地方工业七年赶上农业产值”的号召以后，真是“一声令下，万箭齐发”，各专区、县新建厂矿有如雨后春笋迅速发展。截至3月8日，经省批准1958年兴办的厂矿就有五百六十八个，全省八十二个县、七个市，平均每个县、市兴办六项。
    在解决资金、技术、设备等困难方面，各地采取了许多创造性的办法。解决资金困难，主要采取六项办法：一、省投资省办。二、吸收大城市资金合办。如上海需要铜，便吸收上海资金开采铜矿。三、省投资，专县办。四、专县投资，省补助。五、专县自己投资。挤出财政节余投入工业。六、预付投资，这主要是供销和城市服务等系统，拿出部分资金投入生产自己经营的产品的企业。在解决技术力量困难方面，除派干部到兄弟厂实习外，还进行现场培养。在解决设备问题方面，主要采取清理原有设备、自己安排生产、同外省互通有无以及组织出口物资换取外汇等办法。
    所有这些办法有一个共同的特点，就是自力更生。过去，各县一提办工业，就伸手要钱，伸手要人。现在，都自己积极筹集资金，培养干部。各专区、县都提出要坚决贯彻执行勤俭建厂、勤俭办厂的方针。各厂一律不建礼堂，厂房一律因陋就简。有些工厂还决定不建厂房，如榨油厂、酿酒厂等就可利用祠堂或民房作厂房。各地还注意贯彻“就地取材，就地加工”的原则。所有专县工业项目都合乎“投资少，收益快”的要求。全省五百六十八个项目，平均每项只投资四万元。有些工厂当年兴建，当年生产，当年收回资金，当年便有盈余。
    江西专县工业贯彻勤俭建厂方针的另一特点，是充分利用野生原料。如造纸厂，几乎全部利用笋壳、芭茅草等；酿酒几乎全部利用杨梅、橡子、山梨、板栗等。仅上山干部垦殖场办的十一个纸厂，利用这些野生原料造纸，就可年产纸张六千五百吨。
    江西省各专区、县1958年兴建的五百六十八个厂矿，全部投入生产以后，总产值将达一亿五千万元左右。这将为七年赶上农业产值创造良好的开端。
