This report: The Finance and Accounting Department of the China National Metals and Minerals Import Corporation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has rationally organized manpower and improved working methods, greatly improving work efficiency, changing the situation of excessive tension due to overtime work, and completing work tasks very well.

Since the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the cadres in this department has soared to unprecedented heights, and they have put forward the resounding slogan of "completing the day's work on the same day." However, due to the nature of the business, many tasks in the department often arrive together in the afternoon, such as foreign order documents and contracts from various domestic business departments. Before the Great Leap Forward, these tasks often took several days to complete. Now, how to complete them on the same day? Everyone proposed: "Don't leave work until the work is done, work day and night." Therefore, since March 1st, they have indeed completed the tasks of the day on the same day, but they have to work overtime until 10 or even 12 o'clock every day.

After the leadership discovered this situation, they felt that relying on overtime to complete tasks was not a long-term solution. Therefore, they mobilized everyone to use their brains, think of ways, and find shortcuts, putting forward the slogan of "one person contributes one idea." Comrades immediately proposed the initiative of rationally organizing manpower. After this initiative was adopted by the leadership, the effect was very good. One of the main tasks of this department is to prepare settlement vouchers for foreign order documents. In the past, only some people did this work. Therefore, they were particularly busy in the afternoon and worked overtime a lot. Some other people had less work in the afternoon. The leadership organized these people to learn how to prepare settlement vouchers. When tasks came, everyone launched a concentrated effort. On the afternoon of March 21, 134 foreign order documents arrived at once. Everyone started working together, and as a result, they were completely finished before leaving work. According to the responsible comrade of this department, "If this method had not been adopted, some people would have had to work overtime until 11 o'clock that night."

While rationally organizing manpower, they paid attention to improving working methods. Another major task of this department is to prepare vouchers. In the past, no matter how many vouchers a person had to prepare in an afternoon, they always waited until they were finished before sending them all at once to the comrade in charge of the general ledger. The comrade in charge of the general ledger also had to wait for each comrade to send them in before summarizing, trial-calculating, and balancing, and then reconciling the accounts with everyone. Therefore, it took a long time, and it was impossible to complete everything without working overtime in the evening. Now it has changed. When preparing vouchers, comrades adopt the method of submitting one voucher at a time. The comrade in charge of the general ledger adopts the method of sorting them out as they arrive. In this way, when the comrades preparing the vouchers have finished all the vouchers, the comrade in charge of the general ledger has also quickly sorted them out, and reconciled the accounts with everyone before leaving work. This not only ensured that "accounts matched accounts" every day, but also improved work efficiency.

According to the responsible comrade of this department, after adopting these two methods and improving work efficiency, not only do the cadres no longer have to work overtime and are no longer tired, but there is also a surplus of manpower. After the work is further on the right track, they also plan to ask the leadership to further reduce the number of cadres.

### 合理组织人力　改进工作方法  不加班也能很好完成任务  外贸部五金进口公司财会处的办法好

    合理组织人力　改进工作方法
    不加班也能很好完成任务
    外贸部五金进口公司财会处的办法好
    本报讯　对外贸易部中国五金进口公司财会处合理组织人力，改进工作方法，工作效率大大提高，既改变了加班加点过分紧张的情况，工作任务也完成的很好。
    大跃进以来，这个处的干部工作积极性空前高涨，提出了“当天工作当天完”的响亮口号，但是，由于业务关系，处里的许多任务往往在下午一齐来，如国外订货单据，国内各业务部的合同等等都要到下午才能送到，大跃进以前，这些任务往往拖上好几天才能完成。现在要当天完成怎么办呢？大家又提出：“工作不完不下班，夜以继日，日以继夜的干”。因此，从3月1日以来，确实做到当天事，当天毕，但就是每天都要加班到十点甚至十二点左右。
    领导上发现这个情况以后，感到靠加班加点完成任务，总不是长久之计。于是就发动大家动脑筋、想办法、找窍门，提出“一人献一计”的口号。同志们立即提出了合理组织人力的倡议，这个倡议经领导上采纳后，效果很好。这个处的主要业务之一——做好国外订货单据的结算凭证工作，这工作过去只有部分人做，因此，他们下午特别忙，加班也特别多，另一些人下午的工作比较少，领导上就把这些人组织起来，学会做结算凭证工作，任务一来，大家突击。3月21日下午，一次来了一百三十四份国外订货单据，大家一齐动手，结果，下班以前完全做完。据这个处的负责同志说：“如果不是采取这个办法，这一天有一些人得加班到晚上十一点。”
    在合理组织人力的同时，他们注意改进了工作方法。这个处另一主要任务之一——做传票，过去一个人一个下午不管要做多少传票，总是等做完以后，一次送到“管总账”的同志那里，而“管总账”的同志也要等每个同志都送来，才汇总、试算、平衡，然后再和大家对账，因此，时间拖得很长，要能全部做完，非晚上加班不可。现在改变了，同志们在做传票的时候，采取做一张，送一张的办法，“管总账”的同志采取随到随整理的办法，这样，当做传票的同志把所有传票做完，“管总账”的同志也很快整理好了，下班以前和大家对好账。既做到了每天“账账相符”，又提高了工作效率。
    据这个处的负责同志说：他们采取这两个办法，提高了工作效率以后，现在不仅干部不要加班、不再劳累了，而且人力上还有过剩的现象。待工作进一步走上正轨以后，还准备提请领导上再减少几个干部。
