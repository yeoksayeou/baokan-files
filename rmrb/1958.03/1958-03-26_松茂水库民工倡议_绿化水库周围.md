Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 25th – The laborers of the Songmao Reservoir in Yunnan, who had previously proposed not leaving the construction site during the Spring Festival in a proposal published in the People’s Daily, have recently made another proposal to the entire province: do not leave the water conservancy construction site until the area surrounding the reservoir is greened. They propose planting trees and forests around the reservoir to conserve soil and water, extend the reservoir's lifespan, and achieve the goal of completing the greening task simultaneously with the completion of the project.

    松茂水库民工倡议
    绿化水库周围
    据新华社昆明25日电　曾在人民日报上刊载过春节不下工地倡议的云南松茂水库的民工，最近又向全省提出不绿化水库周围不下水利工地的倡议。他们提出在水库周围植树造林、保持水土，延长水库寿命，作到工程完工绿化任务也同时结束的要求。
