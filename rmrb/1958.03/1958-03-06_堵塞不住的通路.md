Impassable Thoroughfare
By a Commentator of this newspaper

Whenever the international situation tends toward relaxation, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stubbornly tries to resist it. This time, after the Soviet Union agreed with the Western countries' suggestion and proposed convening a foreign ministers' conference to prepare the agenda and determine the members of a summit conference, Dulles immediately came forward to express his opposition. At a reception on March 4, he said countless "no's" to the Soviet proposal, attempting to completely block the thoroughfare to a summit conference that the proposal had opened.

Dulles's reason for opposing the Soviet proposal is that the Soviet proposal only limits the foreign ministers' conference to preparing the agenda and determining the members of the summit conference, which he finds "unacceptable." He believes that the foreign ministers' conference must conduct substantive discussions. According to Dulles's opinion, the foreign ministers' conference will not be a preparatory meeting, but will actually replace the summit conference.

Making the summit conference completely unnecessary is precisely Dulles's sinister attempt. He frankly stated at the press conference that he "sees no reason... why a top-level meeting must be held." And he said: "The traditional diplomatic method is a better and more reliable procedure than acting through a summit conference." Therefore, the function he prescribed for the summit conference is only to "record" the agreements reached through diplomatic channels and foreign ministers' conferences. In other words, it is up to the foreign ministers' conference with Dulles's participation to decide the fate of easing international tensions. And what kind of person Dulles is is well known. The cause he is devoted to is intensifying the "Cold War" and exacerbating international tensions so that American monopoly capital can profit from it. In Dulles's view, there is naturally no important issue at present that has a reasonable possibility of reaching an agreement.

Although Dulles also stated in his speech that he does not rule out exploring ways to reach an agreement through appropriate exploration, he uses this as an excuse for the foreign ministers' conference to discuss substantive issues. However, since Dulles does not consider the summit conference to be a "better and more reliable procedure," who can believe that Dulles will strive to explore ways to reach an agreement at the foreign ministers' conference? He merely wants to bury the summit conference through the foreign ministers' conference.

However, such recklessness by Dulles and his ilk has no market. Even Dulles cannot but admit that the Soviet proposal has received attention from public opinion, while the American attitude has not been "sufficiently understood" by the people of various countries. From this, it can be seen how unpopular the attempts of Dulles and his ilk to obstruct and undermine the summit conference are.

The road to convening a summit conference of Eastern and Western countries cannot be blocked. The attempts of Dulles and his ilk to undermine the summit conference will surely be shattered in the face of the powerful tide of people of all countries striving for peace.

    堵塞不住的通路
    本报评论员
    美国国务卿杜勒斯每当国际局势要走向缓和的时候，总是顽固地企图加以抗拒。这一次，当苏联同意西方国家的意见，提出召开外长会议来准备政府首脑会议的议程和确定会议的成员的建议之后，杜勒斯又立刻出面表示反对。在3月4日的招待会上，他对苏联的建议说了无数的“不”字，妄想一手把这个建议所打开的召开政府首脑会议的通路完全堵塞起来。
    杜勒斯反对苏联建议的理由，就是苏联的建议只限定外长会议为政府首脑会议准备议程和确定会议成员，这在他看来是“不能接受的”。他认为外长会议必须进行实质问题的讨论。按照杜勒斯的这个意见，外长会议将不是一个准备性的会议，而是要在实际上代替政府首脑会议。
    使政府首脑会议成为完全没有必要的事情，这正是杜勒斯的险恶的企图。他在记者招待会上毫不讳言地表示，他“看不出有任何理由……非举行最高级会议不可”。并且说：“传统的外交办法是一种比通过政府首脑会议办事要来得更好和更可靠的程序”。因此，他为政府首脑会议所规定的职能，只是把通过外交途径和外长会议所达成的协议“记录下来”。换句话说，也就是要由有杜勒斯参加的外长会议来决定缓和国际局势的命运。而杜勒斯是怎样一个人，是人所共知的。他所致力的事业是加剧“冷战”和加剧国际紧张局势，以便美国垄断资本能够从中取利。在杜勒斯看来，在目前自然是没有任何重要的问题具有达成协议的合理的可能性的。
    虽然，杜勒斯在发言中也曾表示，他并不排斥通过适当的探索来找到达成协议的办法，而以此作为外长会议必须讨论实质问题的借口。但是，既然杜勒斯并不认为政府首脑会议是一种“更好的和更可靠的程序”，那么，谁能相信杜勒斯会在外长会议上努力去探索达成协议的办法呢？他不过是想通过外长会议来埋葬政府首脑会议罢了。
    但是，杜勒斯和他的同道们的这种胡作非为是没有市场的。甚至连杜勒斯也不能不承认苏联建议受到舆论的重视，而美国的态度却不能得到各国人民的“足够的了解”。由此可知，杜勒斯之流力图阻挠和破坏政府首脑会议的图谋是如何不得人心。
    召开东西方国家政府首脑会议的道路是堵塞不住的。杜勒斯之流破坏政府首脑会议的企图，一定会在各国人民争取和平的强大的潮流面前碰得粉碎。
