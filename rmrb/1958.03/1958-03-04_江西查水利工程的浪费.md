This newspaper's Nanchang, 3rd dispatch: The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Water Conservancy is directing the fire of anti-waste and anti-conservatism towards water conservancy projects currently under construction.

The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Water Conservancy is not only inspecting past waste in surveying, design, and construction, but also focusing on inspecting and opposing waste and conservative phenomena in projects currently under construction. Some projects that were originally considered advanced, after being tempered by the flames of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, were found to be not in line with the principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

The Ganfu Plain water conservancy project, which is currently under construction, is the largest comprehensive utilization project in Jiangxi Province. It was originally thought that the planning of this project was very advanced, but after this inspection, it was found to be not advanced, but backward and conservative, with many wasteful phenomena. After detailed analysis, debate, accounting, and a series of work, the project plan was revised: the national investment was reduced from the original 50 million yuan to 25 million yuan; and it can save 14 million cubic meters of earthwork; the completion time of the project was also shortened from four years to one year. The originally planned benefited area of 1.4 million mu after the completion of the project remains basically unchanged. The power capacity has increased from the original 1,000 kilowatts to 3,000 kilowatts.

    江西查水利工程的浪费
    本报南昌3日电　江西省水利厅把反浪费反保守之火烧向正在兴建的水利工程。
    江西省水利厅不但检查了过去勘测、设计和施工上的浪费，而且着重检查和反对目前正在兴建工程中的浪费和保守现象。有些本来认为先进的工程，一经反浪费反保守的火焰的烧炼，就发现还是不符合多快好省的方针。
    正在着手兴建的赣抚平原水利工程，是江西省最大的一个综合利用工程。本来以为这个工程的规划很先进，这次一检查，就发现不是先进，而是落后保守，有很多浪费现象。经过详细分析、进行辩论、算账和一系列的工作，重新修订了工程规划：国家投资由原来的五千万元减少到二千五百万元；并可以节省一千四百万土方的工作量；工程竣工的时间也由四年缩短到一年。原定在工程完成后一百四十万亩的受益面积，基本不变。容电量反而由原来的一千瓩增加到三千瓩。
