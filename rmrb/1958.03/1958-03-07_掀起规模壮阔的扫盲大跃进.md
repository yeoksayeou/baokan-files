When various construction undertakings in our country are developing rapidly with the momentum of riding the wind and waves, today our newspaper publishes with exciting feelings the news of Ning'an County in Heilongjiang Province, the first county in our country to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and also reports the news of the conference of representatives of advanced units in eliminating illiteracy. The vivid facts of Ning'an County and other advanced units tell us that as long as we have a correct understanding of this work and take effective measures, we can launch a grand mass movement to eliminate illiteracy, promote a great leap forward in literacy, and complete the first step of the task of eliminating illiteracy in a relatively short period of time, namely: eliminating illiteracy among cadres; and basically eliminating illiteracy among workers, peasants, and young and middle-aged urban residents.

Can illiteracy elimination achieve a leap forward? The symposium gave an affirmative answer. Taking Ning'an County as an example, since liberation, the county has held winter schools and literacy classes, and later established year-round people's schools. In the winter of 1955, a literacy upsurge formed throughout the county, and by the end of November 1957, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the county was basically eliminated. The process of eliminating illiteracy in Ning'an County is roughly the same as in other advanced units. Some of these units are plains, and some are mountainous. In the past, when various localities studied the speed of illiteracy elimination, they often emphasized more the objective conditions such as the busy production of the masses, the lack of teachers in many places, and the scattered residences. However, on the other hand, they did not fully estimate the truth of "success depends on human effort." At the symposium, such a situation was reflected that the speed of illiteracy elimination in some mountain villages was even faster than in the plains. They used two or three years, or at most four years, to eliminate illiteracy. The masses described these villages as "culture falling from the sky." In those areas, the level of consciousness, organization, and production of the masses were not as good as they are today when illiteracy elimination was carried out. At present, the entire countryside is undergoing earth-shaking changes, and there are more and more favorable conditions for eliminating illiteracy. It is entirely possible to launch a great leap forward in eliminating illiteracy throughout the country.

Among workers and handicraftsmen, the conditions for eliminating illiteracy are better than those for peasants. Now a group of units that have basically eliminated illiteracy have emerged. The facts of advanced units such as the Northwest Second State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory and the Jiamusi Electric Motor Factory, which attended this meeting, show that the task of eliminating illiteracy can be completed in one or two years or two or three years.

Currently, what hinders the great leap forward in illiteracy elimination is conservative thinking. In the past few years of illiteracy elimination work, both passive conservatism and blind adventurism have been opposed. Today, the leap forward is proposed again. Is it another blind adventurism? The affirmative answer is no blind adventurism, because today's proposal for a leap forward in illiteracy elimination is based on the experience of illiteracy elimination in the past few years, the current conditions of illiteracy elimination work, and the needs of our country's economic and cultural construction. It is absolutely not allowed for people to use opposition to rash advance as a shield for conservative thinking. The experience of Ning'an County and other places proves that to vigorously eliminate illiteracy, it is necessary to fight against right-leaning conservative thinking. In 1956, the work of eliminating illiteracy in Ning'an County had already formed an upsurge, but the leadership did not have enough understanding of this situation, believing that eliminating illiteracy was a long-term task and did not actively lead it. The county party committee promptly checked and criticized this phenomenon and strengthened its leadership. In October 1956, the Fanjiagang United Cooperative in the county first completed the task of eliminating illiteracy. The county party committee promptly studied the situation of this cooperative and organized people to visit it, which played a positive role in overcoming conservative thinking. The reason why the Northwest Second State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory in Shaanxi Province was able to eliminate illiteracy within two years was also because the leadership had firm confidence and constantly fought against conservative thinking.

Those with conservative thinking do not understand or do not fully understand the political and economic significance of eliminating illiteracy and lack the courage to overcome the difficulties. To build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and modern culture, in addition to training a large number of technical talents, management cadres and intellectuals from the working class and peasantry, it is also necessary to improve the cultural level of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Eliminating illiteracy is an important aspect of achieving this task. At present, whether in factories or in the countryside, many grassroots cadres feel many difficulties in their work because they are illiterate. Many workers and peasants have many difficulties in accepting and mastering advanced production technologies because they are illiterate. Many agricultural cooperatives have let landlords, rich peasants, and puppet personnel take on this extremely important task because they do not have their own accountants and work recorders. As for the superstition and unsanitary habits of the masses, etc., are all related to illiteracy. All of this shows that the current needs of our country's socialist economic system and production development are in contradiction with the low cultural level of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and many people are still illiterate. This is still the case today, and this contradiction will become increasingly acute in the future. People's understanding often lags behind objective reality. Therefore, there are two different reflections on this contradiction. One is to have a keen sense of new things, recognize this contradiction, and actively solve it, and vigorously eliminate illiteracy. This is the case with Ning'an County, and this is the case with all advanced units in illiteracy elimination. The leaders of Ning'an County realized that the broad masses of workers and peasants "desire to get rid of illiteracy as much as they hunger for food and thirst for water," and that "eliminating illiteracy is an indispensable part of improving the cultural level and ideological awareness of peasants, consolidating cooperatives, and building a new countryside." The results of illiteracy elimination in many places have played an inestimable role in improving production technology, improving production management, improving mass awareness, and enlivening factory and rural cultural life. The other is either not realizing this problem, or not daring to move forward in the face of difficulties, and not having the determination to solve this problem. Therefore, they do not actively eliminate illiteracy.

Eliminating illiteracy is a long-term, arduous, and complex task. This is an objective reality. Whoever ignores it and attempts to solve the problem with simple and impatient methods will not do things well. The elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people has been going on for eight years, and it will take several more years in the future. To eliminate illiteracy among all the people, it will take a longer time. However, the so-called long-term nature is not indefinite. As long as our guidance is correct, we can appropriately shorten the time. Our country has a large number of illiterate people and complex conditions. Eliminating illiteracy is an arduous task. But this arduousness is relative. Generally speaking, the difficulties in eliminating illiteracy in mountain villages are the greatest. However, the speed of eliminating illiteracy in some mountain villages is faster than that in the plains. This is because the masses in those places feel the pain of being illiterate more deeply, and their courage and determination to get rid of illiteracy are also greater. If there are no teachers, the masses can use methods such as "buying and selling now" and "literacy in series" to solve the problem; if the residences are scattered, they can use methods such as "contracting teaching and learning" and "group teaching" to solve the problem. In a word, difficulties cannot stop us from moving forward, but can only prompt us to work more meticulously and deeply and boost our revolutionary enthusiasm.

To launch a grand movement to eliminate illiteracy, it is still necessary to carry out extensive publicity work, so that the political and economic significance of eliminating illiteracy is known to every household. Thereby mobilizing the people of the whole country to strive for a great leap forward in eliminating illiteracy.

An important lesson from the work of eliminating illiteracy in the past few years is that it is necessary to maintain the regularity and continuity of the movement and prevent the phenomenon of ups and downs. This requires party committees, governments, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and illiteracy elimination associations at all levels to take regular and effective organizational measures. The experience of Ning'an County and all advanced units proves that only by strengthening the unified leadership of party committees at all levels can the continuity of the movement be truly maintained. This is to comprehensively plan, uniformly deploy, uniformly inspect, be responsible at all levels, and divide labor and cooperate.

Comprehensive planning is a reliable way to ensure the sustainability of illiteracy elimination. In rural areas, illiteracy elimination should be planned together with production and other construction undertakings; in government offices, factories, and handicraft cooperatives, illiteracy elimination should be combined with the training of cadres and workers, cultural and educational undertakings, etc., and a unified plan should be formulated; a plan should also be made to eliminate illiteracy among urban residents. At the same time, production and central work in factories and rural areas should be arranged in a unified manner. Experience has proven that to eliminate illiteracy on a large scale, it is necessary to insist on year-round learning. This will inevitably cause certain conflicts with the production and other central work in factories and rural areas. Unified arrangement is an effective way to resolve contradictions, so that the learning of the masses can be closely integrated with production and central work, which is an important guarantee for accelerating the elimination of illiteracy. On the basis of unified arrangements, party organizations at all levels must conduct regular inspections and supervision. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee decided to include illiteracy elimination and universal compulsory education as an item in the rural work appraisal. The province appraises it once a year, the county appraises it twice, and the township and cooperative appraise it four times. This is a very good way to inspect and supervise. Eliminating illiteracy, like production, cannot rely solely on individual departments to shoulder this task. This requires the earnest implementation of a system of responsibility at all levels. Under the unified leadership of the party committee, government education departments, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, illiteracy elimination associations, and other organizations at all levels should earnestly take on the responsibility of eliminating illiteracy according to their own nature and tasks.

Fully mobilizing the masses and relying closely on the masses is the fundamental principle of illiteracy elimination work. Experience has proven that where illiteracy elimination work is done well, it is because the masses have been fully mobilized and the high enthusiasm of the masses has been brought into play. Conversely, failure to actively mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and adopt bureaucratic practices that resort to coercion, substitution, and failure to act according to the actual situation of the masses will greatly hinder the development of illiteracy elimination work. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the mass line in the work. Countless facts show that in order to get rid of illiteracy, the workers and peasants study with a tenacious fighting spirit. In addition to attending classes at a certain time, they also do "textbooks with them, looking for teachers everywhere," "everywhere is a classroom, everywhere is a blackboard," and so on. People who study in this way can eliminate illiteracy in a relatively short period of time. This spirit should be widely promoted to create a mass learning atmosphere, just as some places do, "every household has students" and "there is the sound of reading everywhere." Secondly, it is necessary to widely carry out group teaching and contracting teaching and learning activities. This should not only be done among peasants and citizens, but also among some workers and cadres. Otherwise, it is impossible to create a widespread mass learning movement, and it is impossible to achieve a great leap forward in illiteracy elimination. Some people still doubt the actual effect of this form of learning, which in itself is a kind of conservative thinking and should be criticized. Thirdly, it is necessary to mobilize a large number of literate people to serve as teachers. All literate people should participate in this great movement and contribute their own strength. This is also one of the ways for intellectuals to get close to the workers and peasants. Some semi-literate people can also teach others or help others learn if they have the conditions. Especially in some places where there are few literate people, this is a very good way to solve the shortage of teachers. Illiteracy elimination should also implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running schools, and some equipment funds mainly rely on the masses to solve. Government offices, factories, mines, enterprises, agriculture, and handicraft production cooperatives can provide assistance as appropriate. In short, we must firmly believe that the workers and peasants are fully capable of liberating themselves culturally. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, and illiteracy elimination associations have a special task in mobilizing the masses.

### 掀起规模壮阔的扫盲大跃进

    掀起规模壮阔的扫盲大跃进
    当我国各种建设事业以乘风破浪之势飞速发展的时候，今天本报以令人兴奋的心情，发表了我国第一个基本上扫除青壮年文盲的县——黑龙江省宁安县，同时报道了扫除文盲先进单位代表会议的消息。宁安县和其它先进单位活的事实告诉我们，只要对这一工作有正确的认识，并采取有效的措施，就可以掀起一个规模壮阔的群众性的扫除文盲运动，促成扫盲大跃进，在较短的时间内，完成扫除文盲的第一步任务，即：扫除干部中的文盲；基本上扫除工人、农民、城市居民中青壮年的文盲。
    扫除文盲能不能跃进？座谈会作了肯定的答复。以宁安县为例，该县解放以来，就举办了冬学、识字班，以后又举办了常年民校。1955年冬季，全县形成了扫盲高潮，到1957年11月底，即基本上扫除了全县青壮年中的文盲。宁安县扫除文盲的过程，和其他先进单位大致相同。这些单位有的是平原，有的是山地。过去各地在研究扫除文盲速度的时候，往往总是更多的强调了群众生产忙碌，许多地方缺乏教师和居住分散等客观条件。但是另一方面，却没有充分估计到“事在人为”这条道理。在座谈会上，反映了这样一种情况，某些山区村庄，扫除文盲的速度比平原还要快一些。他们用了二、三年，最多四年的时间扫除了文盲。群众形容这些村庄，是“天上掉下来的文化”。这些地区，在进行扫除文盲的当时，群众的觉悟程度、组织情况、生产情况等，并没有今天这样好。当前整个农村在翻天覆地的变化，扫除文盲的有利条件愈来愈多，在全国范围内掀起一个扫除文盲的大跃进是完全可以办到的。
    在工人、手工业者中，扫除文盲的条件优于农民，现在已经出现了一批基本上扫除文盲的单位。出席这次会议的国营西北第二棉纺织厂、佳木斯电机厂等先进单位的事实说明：只要用一、二年或者二、三年的时间，就可以完成扫除文盲任务。
    当前障碍扫盲工作大踏步前进的，是保守思想。几年来扫除文盲工作中，曾经反对过消极保守，也反对过盲目冒进。今天又提出了跃进，是不是又在盲目冒进呢？肯定的回答，不是盲目冒进，因为今天提出扫除文盲的跃进，是根据几年来扫除文盲的经验，当前扫除文盲工作的条件和我国经济建设、文化建设的需要。绝不允许人们以反对冒进作为保守思想的护身符。宁安县及其他地方的经验证明：要大力扫除文盲，必须和右倾保守思想作斗争。宁安县在1956年扫除文盲工作已经形成了高潮，但是领导上对这种形势认识不足，认为扫除文盲是长期的任务，没有积极地加以领导。县委对这种现象及时地进行了检查和批评，并加强了领导。1956年10月，该县范家乡联合社首先完成了扫盲任务。县委及时地研究了这个社的情况，并组织人去参观，对于克服保守思想起了积极作用。陕西省西北国棉二厂，所以能够在两年之内扫除文盲，同样是由于领导上有坚定的信心，不断地与保守思想作斗争的结果。
    有保守思想的人不懂得，或不完全懂得扫除文盲的政治、经济意义并缺乏克服困难的勇气。要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，除了培养大量的工农出身的技术人才、管理干部以及各方面的知识分子以外，还必须提高广大工农群众的文化水平。扫除文盲正是实现这个任务的重要方面。现在，不论工厂和农村，都有不少的基层干部，因为是文盲，工作上感到许多困难。有不少的工农群众，因为是文盲，在接受和掌握先进的生产技术方面，发生许多困难。有不少的农业合作社，因为没有自己的会计、记工员，而让地主、富农分子、敌伪人员担任这项极重要的工作。至于群众的迷信、不卫生等等，都和文盲有关。这一切，都说明了当前我国的社会主义经济制度和生产发展的需要，与广大工农群众文化水平低，许多人还是文盲的矛盾。今天尚且如此，今后这个矛盾就会愈来愈尖锐。人们的认识往往是落后于客观实际的。因此，对这种矛盾，有两种不同的反映。一种是，对新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉，认识了这个矛盾，并积极地解决它，大力扫除文盲。宁安县如此，一切扫盲工作的先进单位都是如此。宁安县的领导上体会到广大工农群众“要求摆脱文盲的心情，如饥盼食渴盼水”，“扫除文盲是提高农民文化水平、思想觉悟、巩固合作社、建设新农村不可缺少的组成部分”。许多地方扫除文盲的结果，对提高生产技术、改善生产管理、提高群众觉悟、活跃工厂、农村文化生活等方面，都起了不可估量的作用。另一种是，或者没有认识到这个问题，或者在困难面前不敢前进，没有决心解决这个问题。因此，不积极地扫除文盲。
    扫除文盲是一项长期、艰巨、复杂的任务。这是客观现实。谁忽视了它，企图用简单急躁的办法解决问题，就不会把事情办好。扫除青壮年中的文盲已经进行了八年了，今后还需要用几年的时间。要扫除全体人民中的文盲，那就需要较长一些的时间。但是，所谓长期性，不是无期限，只要我们指导的正确，就可以适当地缩短时间。我国文盲众多、条件复杂，扫除文盲是一项艰巨的事业。但这种艰巨性是相对的。一般说来，山区村庄扫除文盲的困难是最多的。但是，某些山区村庄扫除文盲的速度比平原还快了一些。这是因为那些地方的群众对于不识字的痛苦感觉更加深切，摆脱文盲状态的勇气和决心也就更大。没有教师，群众可以用“现买现卖”、“串连识字”等办法解决；居住分散，可以用“包教包学”、“小组教学”等办法解决。一句话，困难不能阻挡我们前进，只能促使我们工作更加细致深入，鼓起我们的革命干劲。
    要开展一个规模壮阔的扫除文盲运动，仍然十分必要进行广泛的宣传工作，使扫除文盲的政治意义、经济意义家喻户晓。从而动员全国人民为扫除文盲的大跃进而努力。
    几年来，扫除文盲工作的一条重要教训是：必须保持运动的经常性持续性，防止忽起忽落，起伏无常的现象发生。这就需要各级党委、政府、工会、共青团、妇联、扫盲协会等组织，采取经常而有效地组织措施。宁安县以及一切先进单位的经验证明：只有加强各级党委的统一领导，才能真正保持运动的持续性。这就是要全面规划，统一布置，统一检查，层层负责，分工协作。
    全面规划是保证扫盲持续性的可靠办法。在农村要把扫除文盲和生产以及其他各项建设事业统一订出规划；在机关、工厂、手工业合作社，扫除文盲要和干部、工人的培训、文教事业等结合起来，订出统一规划；扫除城市居民中的文盲，也应该做出规划。同时把工厂、农村的生产和中心工作作统一布置。经验证明，要大规模地扫除文盲，必须坚持常年学习。这就必然要和工厂、农村的生产以及其他中心工作发生某些矛盾。统一安排是解决矛盾的有效办法，这样就可以使群众的学习和生产、中心工作密切地结合起来，是加速扫除文盲的重要保证。在统一安排的基础上，各级党的组织必须经常地进行检查和督促。福建省委决定把扫盲和普及义务教育列为农村工作评比的一项，省每年评一次，县评两次，乡、社评四次。这是一种很好的检查督促的办法。扫除文盲也如同生产一样，不能仅仅依靠个别部门来担当这项任务。这就要切实实行层层负责制度。在党委的统一领导下，各级政府教育部门、工会、共青团、妇联、扫盲协会等组织，根据自己的性质和任务，切实把扫除文盲的责任担当起来。
    充分发动群众，紧紧依靠群众，是扫除文盲工作的根本方针。经验证明：凡是扫除文盲工作做得好的地方，都是由于充分发动了群众，发挥了群众的高度积极性的结果。反之，不去积极发动群众，依靠群众，而采取强迫命令、包办代替、不根据群众实际情况办事的官僚主义做法，都会大大地妨害扫盲工作的发展。因此，有必要强调工作中的群众路线。无数的事实表明：工农群众为了摆脱文盲状态，他们用顽强的战斗精神来学习。除了在一定时间上课外，他们还做到“课本随身带、到处找老师”，“到处是课堂，到处是黑板”等等。用这种办法学习的人，就可以在较短的时间内扫除文盲。这种精神应该广为提倡，造成一种群众性的学习气氛。正如有些地方那样“家家有学员”，“处处有读书声”。其次，必须广泛地开展小组教学和包教包学活动。不仅在农民、市民中应当这样，就是在某些工人和干部中，也同样要这样做。否则就不可能造成一个广泛性的群众学习运动，不可能使扫除文盲来个大跃进。现在还有人怀疑这种学习形式的实际效果，这本身就是一种保守思想，应该予以批判。再次，必须动员大量识字的人担任教师。凡是识字的人都应该参加到这个伟大的运动中来，贡献自己的一份力量，这也是知识分子接近工农群众的办法之一。有些半文盲只要有条件也可以教别人或者帮助别人学习。特别是某些识字人少的地方，这是解决教师不足的一个很好办法。扫除文盲也应该贯彻勤俭办学的精神，一些设备经费主要依靠群众解决。机关、厂矿、企业、农业、手工业生产合作社，可酌情给以帮助。总之，我们必须坚定地相信工农群众是完全能够在文化上解放自己。工会、共青团、妇联、扫盲协会，在发动群众方面负有特殊的任务。
