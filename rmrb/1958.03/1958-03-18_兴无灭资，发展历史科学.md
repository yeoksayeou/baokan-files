Promote Proletarian Ideology and Eliminate Bourgeois Ideology, Develop Historical Science
Jian Bozan

In my opinion, the great leap forward in historical science first requires clearing away ideological obstacles. The ideology that hinders the leap forward is bourgeois ideology. A prominent manifestation of this ideology is the tendency to "value the past and disparage the present," as pointed out by Comrade Chen Boda. Comrade Boda said that those who study history now "always talk about the Three Dynasties," which is a pointed criticism. We should accept this criticism. Of course, Comrade Boda does not mean that we should not study ancient history. China has a long history, and ancient history should also be studied; however, the study of ancient history is not for the sake of the ancients, but to summarize historical experience and lessons to serve socialism. Due to "valuing the past and disparaging the present," historians fail to see the great historical changes taking place today, resulting in a serious detachment from reality, which has led our historical science back to the old path of scholasticism, clinging to the old and refusing the new.

Bourgeois ideology is also prominently manifested in the tendency to value materials and disparage theory. Here, theory refers to Marxism. It seems that as long as one has materials but no theory, one can become a history expert; otherwise, one cannot become an expert. Those who study history must possess historical materials, and the more the better, but if they do not study Marxism or even despise Marxism, even if they possess historical materials, they are only white experts, and there is even a danger of becoming rightists. Due to valuing materials and disparaging theory, our historical science has lost its combativeness and creativity, and has returned to the old path of textual research and triviality.

Bourgeois ideology is also manifested in valuing specialized history and disparaging general history. We are not opposed to specialized history, and we should encourage historians to conduct specialized research on a certain era, a certain department, or even a certain issue, event, or person in history. However, any specialized research must be based on general history, otherwise it is like building a tall building on the beach. Due to valuing specialized history and disparaging general history, historians only see the trees and not the forest. Moreover, it has also led our historical science back to the old path of fragmented textual research.

We must overthrow these bourgeois ideologies in order to enhance the ideological, scientific, and combative nature of historical science, and to enable historical science to leap forward along the true Marxist path. To overthrow bourgeois ideology, we must launch a struggle between two lines in the field of historical science, to pave the way for the great leap forward in historical science.

The recently convened State Council Science Planning Commission has formulated a draft twelve-year plan for philosophy and social sciences, which puts forward fifteen important issues and twenty-three important works for historical science. To realize these projects is the great leap forward in historical science. For the great leap forward in historical science, I would like to offer the following suggestions:

One, resolutely implement the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" policy, and carry out free discussions on academic issues in various forms, such as organizing discussion meetings, symposiums, and special lectures on historical issues, to first liven up the atmosphere of historical science.

Two, restore the activities of the Historical Society. Hold an annual meeting every year to discuss important issues in historical science, exchange the achievements of historical research across the country, and better organize the historical science team.

Three, establish a system of exchange between research and teaching. It is recommended that researchers in historical research institutions teach in universities for one year after three to five years of research to disseminate their research conclusions. University teachers should go to scientific research institutions for one year of research after three to five years of teaching to improve their scientific level.

Four, in the near future, use collective efforts to compile textbooks on Chinese history, Asian and African history, and world history for universities, so that teachers in various universities can be freed from writing the same lecture notes and put their efforts into scientific research to improve the quality of teaching.

Five, re-discuss the professional settings of history departments in universities, and combine the purpose of training cadres with the new historical science cause. Strive to cultivate a young team of red historical science armed with Marxism-Leninism, tempered by labor, and received basic training in historical science in the next few years.

Six, in order to realize the history of the Republic of China stipulated in the general plan, it is recommended that the National Archives Bureau organize the archives of the Republic of China era in advance.

Seven, in order to realize the history of the People's Republic of China stipulated in the general plan, it is recommended to establish an institution to do this work specifically. And make this institution a permanent institution, specializing in the records of modern history, first compiling long compilations by year, and then writing various monographs.

Eight, attach importance to archival work and the collation and publication of ancient books to provide materials for historical research. In order to promote this work, it is recommended that the National Archives and its branches be regarded as a kind of experimental field for teachers and students of history departments in universities. At the same time, actively organize the translation of famous works and materials on foreign history to create better conditions for the study of foreign history. In addition, organize forces to compile various necessary reference books such as chronologies, maps, dictionaries, and indexes.

Nine, do a good job in information work in historical science. It is recommended to publish a "History Newsletter" to report on the research situation of historical science at home and abroad.

Ten, strengthen international cooperation and exchange in historical science research, and exchange professors, experts, materials, and research results with countries that have cultural agreements with our country in a planned way. In particular, introduce more of the advanced achievements of Soviet historical science research.

    兴无灭资，发展历史科学
    剪伯赞
    据我看来，历史学的跃进，首先是扫除思想障碍。障碍跃进的思想，是资产阶级思想。这种思想的突出表现，就是陈伯达同志指出的“厚古薄今”的倾向。伯达同志说，现在学历史的人“言必称三代”，这是一针见血的批评。我们应该接受这个批评。当然，伯达同志也没有意思要我们不研究古代史。我国历史悠久，古史也应研究；但是研究古史，也不是为了古人，而是为总结历史经验和教训为社会主义服务。由于“厚古薄今”，就使得史学工作者看不见当前伟大的历史变革，造成了严重脱离实际的现象，从而使我们的历史学走回了抱残守缺的经院派的旧路。
    资产阶级思想也突出地表现在厚资料而薄理论的倾向。这里所谓理论，是指马克思主义。好像只要有了资料没有理论也可以成为史学专家，反之就不能成为专家。学历史的人是要占有史料，而且占有的史料愈多愈好，但是如果不学马克思主义甚至轻视马克思主义，即使占有史料，也不过是一个白色专家，甚至还有变成右派的危险。由于厚资料而薄理论，就使得我们的历史学丧失了战斗性、创造性，走回了寻章摘句的烦琐主义的旧路。
    资产阶级的思想还表现在厚专史而薄通史。我们不反对专史，并且应该鼓励史学工作者对于历史上的某一时代、某一部门甚至某一问题、事件、人物进行专题研究。但是任何专题研究都必须要有通史的基础，否则就等于在沙滩上盖大楼。由于厚专史而薄通史，历史学工作者就只见树木不见树林了。而且也使得我们的历史科学走回了支离破碎的考证学的旧路。
    必须把这些资产阶级思想反掉，才能提高历史学的思想性、科学性、战斗性，才能使历史学沿着真正的马克思主义的道路向前跃进。要反掉资产阶级思想，就必须在历史学领域内展开两条路线的斗争，替历史学的大跃进开辟道路。
    最近召开的国务院科学规划委员会已经制定了一个十二年哲学社会科学规划草案，对于历史学提出了十五项重要问题和二十三项重要著作。实现这些项目，就是历史学的大跃进。为了历史学的大跃进，我想提出下面的一些建议：
    一，要坚决地贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，开展各种形式的学术问题的自由讨论，例如组织一些历史问题的讨论会、座谈会和专题讲座，先把历史学的空气活跃起来。
    二，恢复史学会的活动。每年召开一次年会，提出历史学上的重要问题进行讨论，交流全国各地史学研究的成果，把历史学的队伍更好地组织起来。
    三，建立研究与教学交流的制度。建议历史研究机关的研究人员，在研究三年五载之后到高等学校教书一年，传播他们的研究结论。高等学校的教师在教书三年五载之后，到科学研究机构研究一年，提高他们的科学水平。
    四，在最近期间，用集体的力量编出高等学校用的中国史、亚非史、世界史教科书，让各高等学校的教师从编写同样的讲稿工作中解放出来，把力量投入科学研究，提高教学质量。
    五，重新讨论高等学校历史系的专业设置问题，把培养干部的目的和新的历史科学事业结合起来。努力在最近几年培养出一支用马克思列宁主义武装了的、经过劳动锻炼的和受过历史学基本训练的红色的历史科学的青年队伍。
    六，为了实现总规划中规定要写的民国史，建议国家档案局提前整理民国时代的档案。
    七，为了实现总规划中规定要写的中华人民共和国史，建议成立一个机构，专做此事。并且使这个机构成为常设机构，专管现代史的纪录，先按年编出长编，再写成各种专著。
    八，重视档案工作和古籍整理出版工作，替历史研究提供资料。为了推进这种工作，建议把国家档案馆及分馆当作高等学校历史系师生的试验田的一种。同时积极组织外国史名著和资料的翻译的工作，替外国史研究创造更好的条件。此外，组织力量，编出各种必要的工具书如年表、地图、词典、索引之类。
    九，做好历史科学的情报工作。建议出版史学通讯，报道国内外史学研究的情况。
    十，加强历史科学研究的国际合作和交流工作，有计划地和与我国有文化协定的各国交换教授、专家、资料和研究成果。特别是多介绍苏联的先进的历史科学研究的成果。
