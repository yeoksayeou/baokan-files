    A Good Way to Develop Local Industry – The Hen Lays Eggs
    Xuanhua Paper Mill Contracts to Build Four Small Factories This Year
    (Our newspaper, Xuanhua, 28th dispatch) Reporter Fang Chen reports: The Xuanhua Paper Mill, using the method of "the hen lays eggs," plans to help the Zhangjiakou and Chengde Special Zones build ten small paper mills within five years, of which four factories in Wei County, Shangdu County, and others will be completed this year. The construction of these small factories, from factory design, manufacturing machinery, installing machinery, training technicians to starting production, is all contracted by the Xuanhua Paper Mill to be responsible for it from beginning to end.
    The Xuanhua Paper Mill has only more than 480 employees. Last year, it has already helped Xuanhua Town build a small machine-made paper mill. At the beginning of last year, the Xuanhua Town Handicraft Industry Cooperative planned to transform the handmade paper workshop into a small machine-made paper mill. However, after planning for several months, they could not order the machinery, and could not find a design or construction unit. After the Xuanhua Paper Mill learned about it, it took the initiative to propose contracting the construction. There were no design drawings for manufacturing small paper-making machines, so they extracted three technicians from thirteen engineers and technicians and worked with old workers from the repair workshop to study and design based on the principle of large paper-making machines; other technicians used their spare time to design the factory buildings. In forty days, they designed all the small paper-making machines and the main factory building. The paper cooperative could not find construction and installation technicians, so the Xuanhua Paper Mill sent five machine repair workers to help install the machines. In this way, this small paper mill with an annual output of 650 tons of cultural paper, from design, construction and installation, to putting into production, took only five months.
    The Xuanhua Paper Mill's machine repair workshop has only more than forty technicians, and most of the dozen or so machine tools used are old machines from thirty or forty years ago. They encountered many difficulties when manufacturing small paper-making machines. For example, when milling the rotating gear wheels on the large drying cylinder of the paper machine, there was no milling machine, so they installed a milling cutter holder on the twenty-four-foot-long planer and converted the planer into a milling and planing machine. When there was no material, the workshop workers rummaged through the warehouse, planed scrap iron piles, and looked for old materials to replace new materials.
    The Xuanhua Paper Mill adopts two methods for training technicians for the contracted small paper mills. One is that before the factory is built, the county sends new workers to the factory to learn. When the new factory installs the machines, it sends some old technicians to the new factory to help the new workers install the machines while teaching technology, until the new workers can operate independently before the old workers are withdrawn. The second is that the county gives the factory new workers, and the factory transfers some old technicians to the new factory.
    Recently, the Xuanhua Paper Mill calculated an account. It only costs 127,000 yuan to contract the construction of a paper mill with an annual output of 800 tons of paper, from design, manufacturing machinery, construction and installation, which is lower than the cost of manufacturing machinery by professional machinery factories and construction by construction departments.

    发展地方工业的好办法——母鸡下蛋
    宣化造纸厂今年包建四个小厂
    本报宣化28日电　记者方辰报道：宣化造纸厂用“母鸡下蛋”的方法，计划在五年内，帮助张家口和承德两个专区建设十个小型造纸厂，其中今年建成的有蔚县、商都等县的四个厂。这些小型厂的建设，从厂房设计、制造机器、安装机器、培训技术工人到开工生产，全部由宣化造纸厂包干负责到底。
    宣化造纸厂只有四百八十多名职工，去年已经帮助宣化镇建设一座小型机器造纸厂。去年年初，宣化镇手工业联社计划把手工抄纸社改建成小型机器造纸厂，可是筹划了好几个月，订购不到机器，找不到设计、承建的单位。宣化造纸厂知道以后，主动提出包建。制造小型造纸机没有设计图纸，他们就从十三名工程技术人员中抽出三名技术员和修配车间老工人共同根据大型造纸机原理，边研究边设计；其他技术人员利用业余时间，设计厂房。四十天的功夫，他们就把小型造纸机、主厂房全部设计出来。造纸社找不到建筑安装技术工人，宣化造纸厂又派去五名机器修理工人帮助安装机器。就这样，这座年产六百五十吨文化用纸的小型造纸厂，从设计、建筑安装，到投入生产只用了五个月的时间。
    宣化造纸厂的机器修理车间只有四十多名技术工人，使用的十几部机床大部都是三、四十年以前的老机器。他们制造小型造纸机器的时候，遇到很多困难。如铣造纸机大烘缸上的转动牙轮，没有铣床，他们就在二丈四尺长的刨床上安装一个铣刀架，把刨床改为铣、刨两用机床。没有材料，车间工人就翻仓库，刨废铁堆，找旧料代替新料。
    宣化造纸厂给包建的小型造纸厂培养技术工人，采取两种方法。一是在工厂建成以前，由县里派新工人到该厂学习，新厂安装机器时，便派一部分老技术工人到新厂一边帮助新工人安装机器，一边教技术，一直到新工人能独立操作才把老工人抽回来。二是县里给厂里新工人，由工厂调给新厂一部分老技术工人。
    最近，宣化造纸厂算了一笔账，包建一座年产八百吨纸的纸厂，从设计、制造机器、建筑安装，只用十二万七千元，比由专业的机器厂制造机器、建筑部门承建的造价低。（附图片）
