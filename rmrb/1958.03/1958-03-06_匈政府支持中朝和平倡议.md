Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 4th. Hungarian government spokesman Jarosz said at a press conference today that the recent declaration by China and North Korea regarding the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea will help resolve an important problem in the Far East and the unification of Korea.

Jarosz said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had proposed holding fair elections throughout Korea under the supervision of neutral countries after the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea. All peoples and countries who truly hope to solve international problems that cause human anxiety believe that the declarations of China and North Korea are correct and strongly support them. Therefore, world peace-loving public opinion and the Hungarian people unanimously condemn the stubborn attitude shown by the South Korean government and the American ruling clique, as well as their attempts to weaken the significance of the Sino-North Korean declaration with fabricated arguments. The purpose of this practice is to continue to maintain the legal basis for the stationing of American troops in South Korea and to continue to keep Korea divided.

    匈政府支持中朝和平倡议
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　匈牙利政府发言人贾罗什今天在记者招待会上说，中朝两国最近关于中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的声明，将有助于解决远东的一个重要问题和朝鲜的统一。
    贾罗什说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾经建议在一切外国军队撤出南北朝鲜后，将在中立国监督下举行全朝鲜的平等的选举。凡是真正希望解决引起人类不安的国际问题的人民和国家，都认为中国和朝鲜的声明是正确的，并且大力支持这一声明。因此，世界爱好和平的舆论和匈牙利人民都一致谴责南朝鲜政府和美国统治集团所表现的固执态度以及它们用杜撰的论据来削弱中朝声明意义的企图。这种作法的目的是为了继续保持美国军队在南朝鲜驻军的合法基础并且继续使朝鲜保持分裂状态。
