    Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Students
    Make Steel and Grow Vegetables
    Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology is a college with complete equipment, including electric furnaces for refining high-quality steel and automated rolling mills. In implementing the principles of running the school diligently and thriftily, and combining theory with practice, after a college-wide discussion, it was decided to make full use of this equipment for production, which can produce approximately 10,000 tons of steel annually.
    In addition, it was also decided to use the school's open space to grow vegetables, which can supply the school with vegetables for three months of the year.

    北京钢铁学院同学
    炼钢又种菜
    北京钢铁学院是一座设备完整的学院，有炼优质钢的电炉，自动化的轧钢机。在贯彻勤俭办校、理论和实践相结合的原则下，经过全院讨论，决定充分利用这些设备进行生产，可年产约一万吨钢。
    另外，还决定利用学校的空地种菜，每年可自给蔬菜三个月。
