Xinhua News Agency, March 12th dispatch: According to TASS reports: Some leaders of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union who have been nominated as candidates for the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union met with voters in their constituencies on the 11th. They are members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Brezhnev, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, and Shvernik, and alternate members Kahnberzin and Mazurov.

During the meetings, they delivered speeches to the voters, talking about the achievements of the Soviet Union's national economic construction and foreign policy in recent years, as well as some international issues related to the summit conference.

Voroshilov said:
	The Soviet People's One Year of Labor Surpasses the Previous Ten Years

Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, said in a speech to voters in the Kirov constituency of Leningrad that the fruits of one year of peaceful labor by the Soviet people now exceed the gains of the past five or even ten years of labor. The Soviet Union firmly occupies the second place in the world in terms of total industrial output, and the day is not far off when the Soviet industry will become the most powerful industry in the world.

Voroshilov said that since the last election of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the entire social life of the Soviet Union has been further democratized. He also said that the Soviet government has reduced the armed forces by 2.14 million people in recent years.

Voroshilov said that our government was forced to take necessary defense measures, but not to threaten anyone. We have never intended to invade anyone in the past, and we do not intend to do so now. We will continue to fight for lasting world peace, because this is in line with our ideology, in line with our principles of maintaining equal and friendly relations with the people of all countries, and in line with our entire peace-loving policy.

Voroshilov mentioned many measures recently taken by the Soviet government that have helped ease international tensions.

Bulganin said:
	The Soviet Union Will Do Its Best to Strengthen Friendship with Fraternal Countries

Bulganin, when meeting with voters in the Maikop City constituency of the Adyghe Autonomous Oblast, focused on international issues and the Soviet Union's foreign policy. He said that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government regard ensuring world peace as the main goal of their foreign policy. Now, the focus of world opinion is the Soviet proposal to convene a high-level meeting in the near future. The Soviet government proposed that this meeting discuss the most important and pressing international issues. Resolving these issues, or even just resolving some of them, can ease tensions and create favorable conditions for resolving other more complex issues that are currently difficult to agree upon.

Bulganin pointed out that the People's Republic of China and all countries in the socialist camp have participated in the active struggle to win peace and to unite the socialist camp. He said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government believe that doing their best to strengthen the fraternal friendship with great People's China and all socialist countries is their sacred international obligation. He said that the more united and stronger the socialist camp is, the more hope there is for the cause of peace.

Mikoyan said:
	The Soviet Union Has Taken a Big Step Towards Communism

Mikoyan, in his speech to voters in the Yerevan-Stalin constituency of Yerevan, emphasized that the Soviet Union has taken a big step towards communism. This big step is the result of the various measures taken in the four years since the last election. These include various economic measures taken to change the form and method of economic and administrative leadership, as well as measures to expand the power of the union republics and local soviets. Overall, this is the tremendous work done by the Party and the people of the whole country in establishing new "organizational relations" including planned production and distribution. Mikoyan emphasized that all this means the further development of the Soviet socialist state, and from a theoretical point of view, this is a new contribution to the doctrine of socialist countries and to the political economy of socialism.

When talking about the Soviet Union's foreign trade, Mikoyan pointed out that the total value of the Soviet Union's foreign trade in 1957 reached 33 billion rubles, which is six times the total value of foreign trade in 1938 before the war, calculated at comparable prices. Now the Soviet Union's foreign trade scale ranks sixth in the world, and it trades with more than 70 countries. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Asian and African countries increased more than five times in 1957 compared with 1953.

Suslov said:
	Soviet Production Will Exceed the US Level Ahead of Schedule

Suslov is a candidate in the Saratov-Lenin constituency of Saratov. In his speech, he analyzed in detail the achievements made by the Soviet Union in the past four years. He said that between 1954 and 1957, the Soviet Union's total industrial output increased by 55%, while the United States' total industrial output increased by only 7% during this period. Now, even those who are not friendly to us have to admit that the socialist economic system is superior to the capitalist economic system. Former US Secretary of State Acheson said: "Twenty years later, the output of Soviet products will exceed the level of the United States." Acheson also said that once it really exceeds, then the entire history of the earth will have to be changed. Suslov said that we can assure Mr. Acheson that the output of Soviet products will not only exceed the level of the United States, but will also be much earlier in time than Acheson thought.

Mukhitdinov said:
	The Soviet Union Fully Supports Indonesia's Struggle

Mukhitdinov spoke about the national independence movements in Asian and African countries at a voter meeting in the Tashkent-Kirov constituency of Tashkent. He said that the increasing number of independent Asian and African countries appearing on the international stage shows that the collapse of the imperialist colonial system has entered its final stage.

Mukhitdinov emphasized that the colonialist essence of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has recently been particularly evident in Indonesia. There, rebels, with the help of foreign imperialists, established a counter-revolutionary "government" in Sumatra, undermining Indonesia's national independence. He said: "The Soviet Union fully supports the just struggle of the friendly Indonesian people, and hopes that they will gloriously overcome temporary difficulties and defend national freedom and independence."

Mukhitdinov also talked about the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, India, and Indonesia. He then said that the relations between the Soviet Union and Iran have also been developing normally and mutually beneficially in recent times. Currently, there are all objective conditions to greatly improve relations between the Soviet Union and Pakistan. The Soviet government is working to establish mutual understanding, trust, and closer political, economic, and cultural ties with Turkey.

He also said that the Soviet Union's friends in the Near East are Egypt and Syria, the two countries that make up the United Arab Republic. The Kingdom of Yemen, which is also friendly to the Soviet Union, joined the United Arab Republic a few days ago. The Soviet government firmly believes that the tested friendship between the Soviet Union and the Arab countries will continue to be consolidated and developed.

Brezhnev, Shvernik, Kahnberzin, and Mazurov met with voters in Kuibyshev, Moscow, Riga, and Minsk respectively, and delivered speeches.

    让选民了解国家的政策和成就
    苏联党政领导人到各地作报告
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社报道：一些被提名为第五届苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的苏联共产党和政府的领导人，11日分别在自己的选区会见了选民。他们是苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员勃列日?夫、布尔加宁、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、苏斯洛夫和什维尔尼克，候补委员卡恩别尔津和马祖罗夫。
    在会见时，他们向选民发表了演说，谈到了苏联最近几年来国民经济建设和外交政策的成就，以及有关高级会议等一些国际问题。
    伏罗希洛夫说
    苏联人民一年劳动胜过以往十年
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫向列宁格勒基洛夫选区的选民发表演说时说，现在，苏联人民一年的和平劳动的收获比过去五年甚至十年劳动的收获还多。苏联在工业总产值方面稳稳地占居世界第二位，苏联的工业成为世界最强大的工业的日子已经不远了。
    伏罗希洛夫说，自从上届苏联最高苏维埃选举以来，苏联的整个社会生活进一步民主化了。他还说，苏联政府在最近几年把武装部队裁减了二百一十四万人。
    伏罗希洛夫说，我国政府被迫采取了必要的国防措施，但不是为了威胁任何人，我国过去和现在都没有打算要侵犯谁。我们今后仍将不断地为争取世界持久和平而斗争。因为这符合我们的意识形态、符合我们同各国人民保持平等友好互相关系的原则，符合我们整个爱好和平的政策。
    伏罗希洛夫提到了苏联政府最近所采取的许多有助于和缓国际紧张局势的措施。
    布尔加宁说
    苏联将尽力加强同兄弟国家友谊
    布尔加宁在阿迪格自治州迈科普市选区会见选民时着重谈到国际问题和苏联的外交政策。他说，苏共中央和苏联政府把保证世界和平看作是自己的外交政策的主要目的。现在世界舆论注意的中心是苏联关于在最近期间召开高级会议的建议。苏联政府建议在这次会上讨论最重要和最迫切的国际问题。解决这些问题，或者甚至只解决其中某些问题，就能和缓紧张局势，为将来解决其他更复杂的、目前还很难取得协议的问题创造有利条件。
    布尔加宁指出，中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的所有国家都参加了为争取和平和为社会主义阵营的团结的积极斗争。他说，苏联共产党和苏联政府认为，尽力加强同伟大的人民中国、同一切社会主义国家的兄弟友谊，是自己神圣的国际义务。他说，社会主义阵营愈团结、愈强大，和平事业也就愈有希望。
    米高扬说
    苏联已向共产主义迈进了一大步
    米高扬在向埃里温市埃里温—斯大林选区的选民发表演说时着重指出，苏联已经向共产主义迈进了一大步。这一大步是在上届选举以来的四年内所采取的各项措施的结果。其中包括在改变经济和行政领导的形式、方法方面所采取的各项经济措施，以及扩大加盟共和国和地方苏维埃权力等措施。总起来说，这就是党和全国人民在建立包括有计划的生产和分配的新的“组织关系”方面所进行的巨大的工作。米高扬强调说，这一切都意味着苏维埃社会主义国家进一步的发展，而从理论上来看，这对于社会主义国家学说以及对于社会主义的政治经济学，都是一个新的贡献。
    米高扬谈到苏联对外贸易问题的时候指出，1957年苏联对外贸易总额达三百三十亿卢布，按比较价格计算为战前1938年对外贸易总额的六倍。现在苏联对外贸易规模占世界第六位，它同七十多个国家进行着贸易。苏联同亚非国家的贸易额1957年增加为1953年的五倍以上。
    苏斯洛夫说
    苏联生产量将提早超过美国水平
    苏斯洛夫是萨拉托夫市的萨拉托夫—列宁选区的候选人。他在演说中详细分析了四年来苏联所取得的成就。他说，在1954—1957年间，苏联工业总产值增长了55％，而美国的工业总产值在这期间只增长了7％。现在，甚至连那些对我们不怀好感的人也不得不承认社会主义经济制度比资本主义经济制度优越了。美国前国务卿艾奇逊说：“二十年以后，苏联产品的产量将超过美国的水平。”艾奇逊还说，一旦真的超过了，那么地球的整个历史就要改观了。苏斯洛夫说，我们可以向艾奇逊先生保证，苏联产品产量不仅会超过美国的水平，而且在时间上要比艾奇逊想的早得多。
    穆希金诺夫说
    苏联完全支持印度尼西亚的斗争
    穆希金诺夫在塔什干的塔什干—基洛夫选区选民大会上发表演说时谈到了亚非国家的民族独立运动。他说，越来越多的独立的亚非国家出现在国际舞台上，说明帝国主义殖民主义体系的崩溃进入了它的最后阶段。
    穆希金诺夫强调指出，东南亚条约组织的殖民主义实质最近在印度尼西亚表现得特别明显。在那里，叛乱分子在外国帝国主义者的帮助下在苏门答腊建立了反革命“政府”，破坏印度尼西亚的民族独立。他说：“苏联完全支持友好的印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争，并且希望他们光荣地战胜暂时的困难，保卫住民族自由和独立。”
    穆希金诺夫还谈到了苏联同阿富汗、印度、印度尼西亚的友好关系。他接着说，最近期间苏联同伊朗的关系也在正常和互利地发展。目前有一切客观条件来大大改善苏联和巴基斯坦的关系。苏联政府努力同土耳其建立互相了解、信任和更紧密的政治、经济和文化联系。
    他还说，苏联在近东的朋友是埃及和叙利亚，这两个国家组成了阿拉伯联合共和国，同苏联友好的也门王国前几天也加入了联合共和国。苏联政府坚信，苏联同阿拉伯国家的经过实践考验的友谊将不断巩固和发展。
    勃列日?夫、什维尔尼克、卡恩别尔津和马祖罗夫分别在古比雪夫、莫斯科、里加和明斯克会见选民，并且发表了演说。
