    New Creation with Significant Technical and Economic Significance
    Research on Friction Welding Method Successful
    (Our report) A new technology with international standards – the friction welding method – was successfully researched by the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry on March 22. This welding method has extremely significant technical and economic value. It can not only weld many metals that were previously considered very difficult to weld, but also save the country valuable metal materials.
    The friction welding method uses the rotational friction between metal workpieces to destroy the oxide layer on the metal surface. The heat generated by the friction can increase the fluidity of metal plastic deformation during axial compression, promoting the mutual penetration of metal molecules at the workpiece joint surface and bonding them together. This welding method is different from fusion welding, brazing, etc. It can weld a variety of non-ferrous and ferrous metals. Some metals that were previously considered very difficult to weld in some countries, such as aluminum and steel, copper and high-chromium steel, and aluminum and copper, can all be welded using the friction welding method, with high welding quality, economy, and simple operation. This new type of welding method can be used in the power industry, construction industry, machinery manufacturing industry, aircraft manufacturing industry, and other various industrial sectors.
    The use of the friction welding method solves a major technical problem for the large-scale promotion of using aluminum conductors instead of the existing copper conductors, which has a great effect on saving copper resources. The friction welding method also opens up broad applications for the machinery manufacturing sector to save a large amount of valuable high-quality and alloy steel materials used for cutting tools.
    The friction welding method was first researched by Ma Jingyun, a technician at the Building Science Research Institute. Under the guidance of Soviet experts and with the help of other fraternal units, he began exploring new methods for welding copper and aluminum in 1955. Although he repeatedly failed, with the strong support of the Party and the administration, and after years of unremitting efforts, he successfully tested the small-section aluminum-copper friction welding method in October 1957. During the "Double-Anti" movement, Ma Jingyun and all comrades of the Building Science Research Institute worked hard and diligently, designed and manufactured the first domestic friction welding machine, and successfully researched and manufactured welded components of various metals, expanding the scope of use of the friction welding method. Now, they are conducting further research on the friction welding method, in addition to summarizing it theoretically, they are also preparing to further expand its scope of use and enhance its welding capabilities.

    具有重大技术经济意义的新创造
    摩擦焊接法研究成功
    本报讯　一项有国际水平的新技术——摩擦焊接法，3月22日由冶金工业部建筑科学研究院研究成功。这种焊接方法有极重大的技术经济价值，它不但可以焊接许多过去认为焊接非常困难的金属，还能为国家节约贵重的金属材料。
    摩擦焊接法是利用金属工件之间旋转摩擦的方法，以破坏金属表面的氧化层，摩擦所产生的热量，可增加在轴向顶压过程中金属塑性变形的流动性，促进工件接合面金属分子的相互渗透而接合起来。这种焊接方法与熔焊、钎焊等不同，它可以焊接多种有色金属和黑色金属。过去一些国家认为焊接非常困难的某些金属，如铝钢之间、铜与高铬钢之间、铝铜之间，都可以用摩擦焊接法焊接，焊接质量高、经济，操作也很简单。这种新型焊接方法可以用在电力工业、建筑工业、机械制造工业、飞机制造工业，以及其他各种工业部门。
    使用摩擦焊接的方法后，就为大量推广使用铝导线代替现用的铜导线解决了一项重大的技术关键问题，对节约铜资源有很大作用。摩擦焊接法也为机械制造部门大量节约贵重刀具用的优质及合金钢材，开辟了广阔的用途。
    摩擦焊接法是建筑科学研究院技工马景云首先进行研究的。在苏联专家启发和其他兄弟单位的帮助下，他从1955年开始探索铜与铝的焊接新方法。他虽然不断失败，但在党和行政的大力支持下，经过数年不懈的努力，在1957年10月试验成功了小截面的铝铜摩擦焊接法。在双反运动中，马景云和建筑科学研究院全体同志苦干苦钻，设计制成国产第一台摩擦焊接机，研究成功多种金属的焊接制件，扩大了摩擦焊接法的使用范围。现在，他们正在对摩擦焊接法作进一步研究，除了从理论上进行总结以外，还准备使它的使用范围更扩大，焊接能力增强。（附图片）
