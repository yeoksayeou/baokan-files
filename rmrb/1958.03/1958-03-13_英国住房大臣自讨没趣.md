    British Housing Minister Shoots Himself in the Foot

    Since the Conservative government's bill to abolish rent control was passed in the Lower House last year, property capitalists have raised rents, causing tenants to lose 200 million pounds. This bill has been met with fierce opposition from the British people. On February 24, the London Conservative Party local organization held a mass meeting to allow Housing and Local Government Minister Brooke to defend his infamous bill to abolish rent control at the meeting. At the meeting, Brooke was driven out by the masses attending the meeting. British newspapers pointed out that it is rare for a British minister like Brooke to make such a fool of himself in front of the masses in recent decades.

    On the evening of February 24, the Holborn District meeting hall in London was packed with more than 500 excited citizens. Among these people were the heads of housing tenant committees from various districts of London, and even more were tenants who could not afford the high rents and were about to be evicted by landlords.

    Before Brooke arrived, the "Workers and Tenants Committee" of Holborn and St. Pancras districts had already distributed leaflets at the venue, with the title: "Henry Brooke's Crocodile Tears." Although not long ago, Brooke had hypocritically asked landlords to be "fair and reasonable" when raising rents, the tenants deeply hated his hypocrisy.

    As soon as Brooke entered the venue, the crowd immediately released dozens of balloons tied with slogans such as "Get Out Brooke," "Abolish the Rent Control Bill," and "Brooke Resign," while using boos and foot stomping to express their contempt for the minister. The chairman of the meeting, Smith, repeatedly asked everyone to remain quiet and threatened that anyone who did not want to listen should leave, but the crowd immediately booed him off the stage and shouted in unison, "Brooke Get Out."

    Brooke pretended to smile and pretended to be calm as he stepped onto the podium. "Ladies and gentlemen..." He loudly expressed his willingness to answer various questions raised by the masses, but his speech was constantly interrupted by the crowd's loud and rhythmic shouts demanding his resignation. Brooke, covered in sweat, finally took advantage of a brief lull in the crowd's shouting to shout into the loudspeaker with all his might: "The rent bill also stipulates that landlords should be responsible for repairing their homes..." This statement in defense of the landlords further aroused the anger of the crowd, and the shout of "Expel the Scoundrel Brooke" shook the entire venue. The crowd rushed to the podium to question Brooke.

    Chairs were thrown onto the stage, and tables were overturned... Brooke and several Conservative Party leaders panicked and hid in a small room on the side of the podium. A large number of police rushed into the venue, and escorted by a dozen policemen, the disgraced Brooke slipped away from the back door.

    After Brooke was driven away, Lawrence, chairman of the St. Pancras District Tenants Committee, said to the cheering crowd: "As long as we continue to maintain the pressure, we will definitely be able to force this corrupt government to abolish the rent bill." (Long)

### 英国住房大臣自讨没趣

    英国住房大臣自讨没趣
    自从保守党政府提出的废除房租管制法案去年在下院通过后，房产资本家哄抬租金，使住户损失达二亿金镑。这项法案受到英国人民激烈反对。2月24日，伦敦的保守党地方组织召开了一次群众大会，让住房和地方政府大臣布鲁克在这次会上替他的臭名昭著的废除房租管制法案辩护。在会上布鲁克被参加大会的群众所驱逐。英国报刊指出，英国大臣像布鲁克那样地在群众面前当场出丑，近数十年还很罕见。
    2月24日晚上，伦敦荷尔波恩区的会议厅里，挤满了五百多名激动的市民。这些人当中，有伦敦各区的住房租户委员会的负责人，而更多的是那些付不起高额房租即将被房主驱逐的住户。
    布鲁克还没有来，荷尔波恩及圣·潘克拉斯区的“工人及租户委员会”已在会场散发传单，传单的标题是：“享利·布鲁克的鳄鱼眼泪。”尽管不久之前，布鲁克还惺惺作态地要求房主在提高房租时应该“公平合理”，但是住户们对他的虚伪做作是深恶痛绝的。
    布鲁克刚走进会场，群众立即放出了数十个系着“赶走布鲁克”、“废除房租管制法案”、“布鲁克辞职”等标语的汽球，同时用嘘声和顿脚声来表示对这位大臣的轻蔑。大会主席史密斯，一再要求大家保持安静，并且威胁说，谁不愿听的应该出去，但是群众立即将他轰下台，同时齐声高喊“布鲁克滚出去”。
    布鲁克佯装笑容故作镇静地登上讲台。“各位女士和先生们……”他大声表示愿意答复群众提出的各种问题，但是他的讲话不断被群众洪亮而有节奏的要他辞职的喊声打断了。布鲁克满头大汗，终于利用群众喊声稍歇的机会对着扩音器用尽力气喊出：“房租法案也规定房主应该负责修理住宅……”他这句维护房主的话更加激起群众的气愤，“驱逐骗子布鲁克”的喊声震撼了整个会场。群众纷纷涌到讲台前向布鲁克提出质问。
    椅子掷到台上了，桌子被推翻了……布鲁克和几个保守党头子惊惶失措地躲进了讲台侧面的小房间里去。大批警察冲进了会场，在十数名警察护送下，狼狈不堪的布鲁克从后门溜走了。
    布鲁克被赶走后，圣·潘克拉斯区租户委员会主席劳伦斯对欢呼的群众发言说：“只要我们继续保持压力，一定能够迫使这个腐败的政府废除房租法案。”　（龙）
