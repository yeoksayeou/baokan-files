    The Logic of Warmongers
    Ignoring the strong opposition of world public opinion, the American ruling authorities brazenly announced that they would continue to conduct nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. This perverse practice of the United States not only violates the wishes of the people of the world, but also directly violates the United Nations' provisions regarding the U.S. trusteeship of the Pacific Islands.

    However, the U.S. State Department even tried to quibble. It issued a statement saying: "Article 84 of the United Nations Charter and Article 5 of the Trusteeship Agreement stipulate that the United States, as the administering authority, shall ensure that the Trust Territory can fulfill its obligations to the cause of international peace and security."

    The United States wants to test hydrogen bombs in the Marshall Islands, which is obviously an act that endangers international peace and security. The U.S. State Department insists on saying that this is to make the Marshall Islands "fulfill its obligations" to international peace and security. This shows what the concepts of "peace" and "security" really mean in the minds of the American ruling group. This is precisely the logic of warmongers.

    好战者的逻辑
    美国统治当局不顾世界舆论的强烈反对，悍然宣布仍要在太平洋的马绍尔群岛进行核试验。美国这种倒行逆施的做法不仅违反世界人民的愿望，而且直接违反联合国的关于美国托管太平洋岛屿的规定。
    但是美国国务院居然还要强词辩解。它发表声明说：“联合国宪章第八十四条和托管协定第五条规定：美国作为管理当局，应当保证托管地对国际和平及安全的事业能够尽到它的本分。”
    美国要在马绍尔群岛试验氢弹，这明明是危害国际和平和安全的举动，美国国务院却硬把它说成是使马绍尔群岛对国际和平及安全“尽到它的本分”，这说明在美国统治集团的心目中，“和平”和“安全”的概念究竟意味着什么。这正是好战者的逻辑也。
