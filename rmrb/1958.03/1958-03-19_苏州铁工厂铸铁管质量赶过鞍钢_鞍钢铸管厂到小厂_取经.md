Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: The iron water quality and tensile strength of the cast iron pipes produced by the local state-owned Suzhou Iron Factory in Jiangsu Province have exceeded and caught up with those of the Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory. Due to equipment limitations, the surface finish and thickness uniformity of the cast iron pipes are still not as good as those of the Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory.

Both the Suzhou Iron Factory and the Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory produce cast iron pipes, but the equipment of the two factories differs greatly. The production process of Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory is mechanized, and the output of cast pipes is very large. The Suzhou Iron Factory has relatively old equipment, and some processes still rely on manpower. Its monthly output is not even as much as two days' output of the vertical casting workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory. The workers of the Suzhou Iron Factory have been working creatively with simple and crude equipment, accumulating a lot of valuable experience in production.

This newspaper reports: The state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company Cast Pipe Factory recently visited the local state-owned Suzhou Iron Factory to learn from seven production experiences, solving some key production problems that had not been solved for a long time.

The Suzhou Iron Factory has accumulated some important operational experience under simple and crude conditions. For example, the sand molds used for vertical casting of iron pipes in Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory must be replaced after casting one iron pipe, while the hard molds used in Suzhou Iron Factory can continuously cast more than one hundred iron pipes after one repair. The key lies in the different composition of the sand mixture. Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory uses a considerable amount of quartz powder when making and baking molds, which produces a lot of dust and affects workers' health, while the hard mold sand mixture used in Suzhou Iron Factory does not require quartz powder, avoiding silicosis for workers.

In mid-January of this year, when the director and engineer of the Suzhou Iron Factory went to Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory to learn the centrifugal casting method of iron pipes, they introduced the production of iron pipes in their factory, which attracted the attention of the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Cast Pipe Factory. The Cast Pipe Factory immediately sent a deputy director, engineers, workshop directors, technicians and other five people to Suzhou for a visit. They were very modest in their visit and study, listening and watching carefully. As a result, the personnel from Anshan Iron and Steel not only technically affirmed the two important advanced experiences of using molds and not using quartz powder in Suzhou Iron Factory, but also discovered some other new advanced operating experiences.

    苏州铁工厂铸铁管质量赶过鞍钢
    鞍钢铸管厂到小厂“取经”
    据新华社南京16日电　江苏省地方国营苏州铁工厂铸铁管的铁水质量和铸铁管抗拉强度都超过和赶上了鞍钢铸管厂。由于设备限制，铸铁管的表面光洁度和厚度的均匀方面还是不如鞍钢铸管厂好。
    苏州铁工厂和鞍钢铸管厂都是生产铸铁管的，但两厂的设备却相差很远。鞍钢铸管厂生产过程机械化，铸管产量很大。苏州铁工厂设备比较陈旧，若干工序还靠人力，一个月产量还抵不上鞍钢铸管厂立浇车间两天的产量。苏州铁工厂的职工们因陋就简，创造性地劳动，在生产上积累了不少宝贵经验。
    本报讯　国营鞍山钢铁公司铸管厂最近到地方国营苏州铁工厂参观访问，学习了七项生产上的经验，解决了长期以来没有解决的一些生产关键问题。
    苏州铁工厂在因陋就简的情况下，积累了一些重要的操作经验。例如，鞍钢铸管厂立浇铁管所用的砂模，浇一根铁管便要掉换一副模子，而苏州铁工厂用的硬模，修理一次可连续浇铸铁管一百多根，关键在于配砂的成分不同。鞍钢铸管厂制模和烘模时，因为使用相当多的石英粉，粉尘很多，影响工人的健康，而苏州铁工厂用硬模配砂不需要石英粉。避免了工人生矽肺病。
    今年1月中旬，苏州铁工厂厂长、工程师到鞍钢铸管厂学习离心浇铸铁管方法时，介绍了本厂生产铁管的情况，引起了鞍钢铸管厂领导人员的注意。铸管厂立即派了副厂长、工程师、车间主任、技术员等五人到苏州参观。他们在参观、学习时非常虚心，仔细听，仔细看。结果，鞍钢的人员不仅从技术上肯定了苏州铁工厂使用模子和不用石英粉这两条重要的先进经验，还发现了其他一些新的先进操作经验。
