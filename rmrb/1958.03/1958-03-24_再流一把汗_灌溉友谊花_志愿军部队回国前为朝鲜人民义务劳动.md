Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 22nd: The follow-up troops of the first batch of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army withdrawing from Korea have been handing over defense duties to the Korean People's Army in recent days. At the same time, they are seizing the time before returning home to perform voluntary labor for the Korean people. Many units, in entire regiments, battalions, and companies, have gone to construction sites to assist the Korean people in building water conservancy projects and repairing roads. They have also helped local Korean people build schoolhouses, kindergartens, cowsheds, and silkworm rearing rooms, as well as helping landlords fetch water, grind flour, chop firewood, and deliver manure. Leaders of the units have also taken the lead in participating in labor.

Many officers and soldiers of the follow-up troops of the first batch of the withdrawing Korean troops have voluntarily proposed: not to take a single day off, not to take a single Sunday, and to use all available spare time to irrigate the flower of Sino-Korean friendship with their own sweat before returning home. Thirty-eight engineering soldiers of a certain unit participated in labor day and night for eight days, totaling 325 workdays. When a truck carrying ten soldiers from a certain unit broke down, they immediately went to help the Korean farmers who were carrying manure to the fields by the roadside while waiting for the driver to repair the car. Yang Weiqing, the political commissar of a certain regiment, personally drove a mule cart to deliver manure to the fields for the Korean people. When a certain unit was repairing a dike, the soldiers' shoulders were swollen from carrying earth, so they switched to carrying earth in sacks. The cooking squad of a certain unit had only four cooks, but they meticulously arranged their work and sent three of them to participate in labor.

    再流一把汗  灌溉友谊花
    志愿军部队回国前为朝鲜人民义务劳动
    新华社平壤22日电　中国人民志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队的后续部队，连日来一面同朝鲜人民军交接防务，一面在归国前抓紧时间为朝鲜人民进行义务劳动。许多部队整团、整营、整连地开到工地上，协助朝鲜人民兴修水利和修整公路；他们还帮助驻地朝鲜人民建校舍、盖托儿所、修牛棚和盖蚕室，帮助房东挑水、推磨、劈柴和送粪。部队首长也都带头参加了劳动。
    首批撤出朝鲜部队后续部队的许多官兵，在归国前自动提出：不休一天假，不过一个星期日，并利用一切空隙时间，用自己的汗水来灌溉中朝友谊之花。某部三十八个工兵战士八天中日夜参加劳动，共出劳动日三百二十五个。某部十个士兵乘坐的卡车中途发生故障，他们在等待司机修车的时候，看到公路旁的朝鲜农民往田里背粪，就立刻一齐前去帮助。某团政治委员杨维青亲自赶着骡马车，为朝鲜人民往田里送粪。某部队修水堤时，战士们抬土抬得肩膀压肿了，又改用麻袋背土。某部炊事班只有四个炊事员，他们细致地安排了工作，抽出三个人参加了劳动。
