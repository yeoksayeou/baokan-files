    Only One Dime and Five Cents
    Not long ago, I came out of my work unit and, because I was carrying a large package, I hired a pedicab (vehicle number 9463) near Jinling East Road and Shandong Road in Shanghai to go to the intersection of Xiamen Road and Zhejiang Road. To avoid haggling, I immediately offered two dimes. Unexpectedly, this pedicab worker said, "Comrade, this short distance only needs one dime and five cents." This was the first time I encountered this situation. After he took me to my destination, he gladly accepted the one dime and five cents fare. Although the matter was small, the impression was very deep. It shows that good morals are appearing everywhere in our society. (Liang Zhihu)

    只要一角五
    不久前的一天，我从工作单位出来，因拿着大包东西，在上海金陵东路、山东路附近雇喊三轮车（车号9463）到厦门路、浙江路口。为了避免讨价还价，我一开口就出二角钱。不料这位三轮车工人说：“同志，这点点路，只要一角五分够了。”这是我第一次碰到的情况。他送到我目的地后，乐意地接受了一角五分车钱。事情虽小，印象却很深。它说明在我们的社会里，到处出现好风气。　（梁智虎）
