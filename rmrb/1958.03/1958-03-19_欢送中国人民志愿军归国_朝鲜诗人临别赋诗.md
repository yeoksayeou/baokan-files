Seeing Off the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Home
Korean Poets Compose Poems of Farewell

    This month, on March 16th, our Volunteer Army began to withdraw from Korea. Korean poets composed poems to bid farewell. The following are some of the poems composed by Korean poets to welcome the Volunteer Army. (The last two are excerpts). Yin Chengwu visited China in 1954 as a member of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly. Park Seokjeong is a famous old Korean poet, and Park Seung is also a famous Korean poet.

    Volunteering to go to war, volunteering to return, the great righteousness is rare in ancient and modern times.
    The same flowing hot blood destroys stubborn enemies, the initiative to withdraw troops demonstrates our might.
    Fame shakes Changjin, eternally green, merit remains in Shangganling, for ten thousand years magnificent.
    Great achievements and virtues are hard to express, forever new with mountains, rivers, sun and moon!
            Yin Chengwu

    Eight years of hardships and joys with you, wanting to pour out my feelings, how can there be an end!
    What place, what mountain is not marked by blood? High steles and pagodas remember your kindness and merits.
    Righteousness is like the Luoshi (羅史) standing tall, courage is like Huangqiu (黃丘), a hero for generations.
    Wanting to express my heart, I have nothing to give, I offer a red hibiscus flower.
            Yin Chengwu

    "Whether in remote mountains, on nameless paths, you can find the sweat and blood left by the Volunteer Army... In the battles of Shangganling and on the construction site of the Aihe River dam, in the names of the immortal Huang Jiguang and Luo Shengjiao, the whole world saw a new era... Your incomparably broad and profound grace and virtue cannot be compared even by the sky and the sea." Park Seokjeong

    "Flowers bloom in spring, but on this land, the kindness and merit you left behind will bloom forever in all seasons... Brothers, I wish you a safe journey." Park Seung

    欢送中国人民志愿军归国
    朝鲜诗人临别赋诗
    本月16日，我志愿军开始撤离朝鲜，朝鲜诗人纷纷作诗送别，下面几首诗就是朝鲜诗人为欢送志愿军而作的。（后两首是摘要）尹澄宇于1954年曾以朝鲜最高人民会议议员的身份来我国访问，朴石丁是朝鲜著名的老诗人，朴胜也是朝鲜著名的诗人。志愿出兵志愿归，昭昭大义古今稀。同流热血摧顽敌，主动撤军示我威。名振长津千古碧，功留上甘万年巍。伟勋美德言难尽，长与山河日月新！
            尹澄宇×××八年甘苦与君同，欲诉衷情岂有穷！何地何山非血迹？高碑高塔记恩功。义如罗史千夫立，勇似黄丘百代雄。欲表寸心无物赠，槿花折送一枝红。
            尹澄宇×××“无论在深山僻壤，在无名的小径上，都可以找到志愿军留下的汗水和血迹……在上甘岭战斗中和艾山江堤坝工地上，在永生的黄继光和罗盛教的名字里，全世界看到了新的时代……你们的无比宽阔深厚的恩惠和功德，连苍空和大海都不能比拟。”朴石丁×××“花儿是在春天开，可是在这块土地上，你们留下的恩功，将四季盛开不败，……兄弟们，祝你们一路平安。朴胜
