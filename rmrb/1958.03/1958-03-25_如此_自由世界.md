Such a "Free World"

　　Sales of Tranquilizers are Booming
　　It is estimated that in 1956, Britons spent £1.43 million on "tranquilizer" pills, consuming 75 to 80 million pills, an average of one and a half pills per adult British man, woman, and child.
　　The United States sells approximately 3 billion "tranquilizer" pills each month, with an average of 240 pills consumed per American per year.
　　"Tranquilizers" became widely available in the United States after World War II and have now become addictive to people throughout Britain.

　　Couples Committing Suicide
　　The serious unemployment and difficult living conditions have led to an increase in cases of couples committing suicide in Japan.
　　In January and February of this year alone, 164 cases of couples committing suicide occurred in various parts of Japan, with over 200 cases including attempted suicides.
　　Many of those committing suicide deliberately choose scenic spots as the location. On the evening of March 10th, in Nikko, a tourist area north of Tokyo, there were five cases of couples committing suicide.

　　An Example of "Freedom of Belief"
　　An Italian teacher in Milan was recently dismissed by the education authorities because she happened to tell elementary school students after Christmas that God does not exist, and that the holiday gifts they received were given by their parents, not by God.
　　The teacher, dissatisfied with the local education authority's decision, appealed to higher authorities. However, the higher authorities still believe that "it is worth punishing someone for destroying children's minds in this way. People with similar ideas should not be allowed to be teachers."

    如此“自由世界”
    镇静剂药片畅销
    据估计，1956年度英国人花在“镇静剂”药片上的钱，数达一百四十三万镑，消耗了七千五百万至八千万片，平均每一个成年的英国男女与小孩吃了一片半。
    美国每一个月所卖出的“镇静剂”药片，约三十亿片之多，平均每一个美国人在一年之内吃了二百四十片。
    “镇静剂”这种东西，是二次大战结束后美国大量销行的，现在已影响到英国各地的人都上了瘾。
    男女双双自杀
    失业现象严重和生活困难，使日本的男女双双自杀事件正在增加。
    只是今年1月和2月，在日本各地就发生了一百六十四起男女双双自杀事件，连同自杀未遂的事件在内，要超过二百起以上。
    许多自杀者特意选择风景名胜地区作为自杀的地点。3月10日晚上，只是在东京以北的游览区日光，就发生了男女双双自杀事件五起。
    “信仰自由”一例
    意大利米兰有一位女教师最近被教育当局革职。原因是她曾在圣诞节后偶然对小学生们说：上帝并不存在，他们收到的节日礼物只是自己父母赠送的，不是上帝赐予的。
    这位女教师不服当地教育机关的处分，向上级申诉。但是，上级却仍然认为：“这样摧残孩子的心灵是值得处罚的。不应该让有类似这种想法的人当教员。”（附图片）
