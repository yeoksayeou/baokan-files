Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 9th: Hanoi newspapers today published editorials and commentaries supporting Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's proposal in his letter to Ngo Dinh Diem on March 7th to discuss the reduction of troops on both sides and the mutual exchange of trade.

The "People's Daily" editorial first condemned the United States for recently blatantly announcing that they could not "lose" South Vietnam and were preparing to turn South Vietnam into a member state of the Southeast Asia Group.

The editorial pointed out that Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's proposals to Ngo Dinh Diem would help repel American interference and guarantee peace in Vietnam.

The editorial stated that if the South Vietnamese authorities have the same good intentions, the consultations desired by the entire Vietnamese people can be realized.

The "Hanoi Daily" commentary said that the entire Vietnamese people hope that both sides will reduce troops and engage in mutual trade, and whoever violates this desire will be opposed by the entire people.

The "New Era Daily" pointed out that the realization of troop reductions and mutual trade will create favorable conditions for consultations on general elections and the unification of Vietnam.

    据新华社河内9日电　河内各报今天发表社论和评论，支持范文同总理3月7日写给吴庭艳的信中提出的讨论裁减双方军队和互通贸易的建议。
    “人民报”在社论中首先指责美国最近明目张胆地宣布他们不能“失去”南越，并且准备把南越变成东南亚集团的成员国。
    社论指出，范文同总理向吴庭艳提出的建议，将有助于打退美国的干涉和保障越南的和平。
    社论说，南越当局如果有同样的善意的话，越南全国人民所希望的协商就可以实现。
    “河内日报”的评论说，越南全国人民都希望双方都来裁军和互通贸易，谁违背这个愿望，谁就要受到全国人民的反对。
      “新时代报”指出，实现裁军和互通贸易，将为协商普选、统一越南创造有利的条件。
