State-owned farms and ranches possess modern equipment and cultivate large areas of land, operating entirely according to state plans and demonstrating superiority in agricultural and animal husbandry production.

Our country's state-owned farm and ranch enterprises have grown from nothing to something, from small to large. Currently, the state-owned farms and ranches within the land reclamation system alone (excluding those affiliated with special districts and counties, same below) number 710, with a cultivated area of 18 million mu, equivalent to three and a half times the cultivated area of all farms and ranches in the country at the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan. The number of tractors they own has also increased from more than 1,700 standard units in 1952 to 10,000 standard units.

These state-owned farms and ranches were all established on barren land. Over the past few years, under the strong leadership of the Party and with the financial and material support of the state, the employees have carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and selfless labor, regardless of cold or heat, in the swamps of the Northeast, the arid saline-alkali land of the Northwest, the coastal saline-alkali land, the lake depressions in the Yangtze River basin, and the red soil areas of South China, turning wilderness into fertile land and creating batches of state-owned farms and ranches. These state-owned farms and ranches operate according to local conditions, engaging in the production of grains, animal husbandry, cotton, oil crops, rubber, fruit trees, tea and mulberry, vegetables, etc., and have produced a considerable amount of agricultural and livestock products for the state. During the First Five-Year Plan period, a total of 4 billion jin of grain, 480 million jin of soybeans, 940,000 dan of cotton, and 900,000 pigs were produced, with a total output value of 1 billion yuan, equivalent to the total amount of state investment in capital construction for land reclamation enterprises during these five years. In addition, large quantities of tropical and subtropical crops such as rubber, sisal hemp, coffee, and citronella were planted.

Our country's state-owned farms and ranches are socialist agricultural enterprises owned by the whole people that manage large areas of land and are equipped with modern technology. Although their proportion in the national agriculture is still very small, they have already demonstrated greater superiority. This is because they are modern enterprises with a high commodity rate of products, able to produce the agricultural and livestock products most urgently needed by the state entirely according to state plans. In recent years, the per unit area yield of grain and cotton on state-owned farms has generally been higher than that of local agricultural cooperatives. In 1957, the average yield of wheat per mu on state-owned farms nationwide was 20% higher than the national average, soybeans were 18% higher, and cotton was 69% higher. Rice was slightly lower than the national average due to poor harvests on several major rice-producing farms (it had been higher than the national average for the past four years). In 1957, 29 farms nationwide had reached or exceeded the targets of 400, 500, and 800 jin of grain, and 48 farms had reached the targets of 60, 80, and 100 jin of ginned cotton. In recent years, state-owned farms and ranches in various places have also played a demonstrative role to varying degrees for agricultural cooperatives in the management of large agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises, in production technology reform, and in mechanization. In addition, they have supplied agricultural cooperatives with 900 million jin of improved seeds and more than 30,000 head of fine breeding livestock.

Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are a main force in building state-owned farms and ranches. Many of our country's state-owned farms and ranches were built by the army through land reclamation and production after the national liberation. State-owned farms and ranches are not only an important place for social labor employment, but also a glorious labor post for demobilized soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to make contributions to socialist construction.

Over the past few years, more than 50,000 cadres of state-owned farms have accumulated experience in land reclamation and production and running farms diligently and thriftily, and have also surveyed more than 800 million mu of wasteland. This has created favorable conditions for our country to reclaim more land and build more farms in the future. As for the problems that existed in some farms in the past, such as poor management, unreasonable rules and regulations, or inappropriate technical measures, neglecting to develop diversified operations according to local conditions, etc., which affected the improvement and development of farm production, are being rectified in the current rectification movement. The phenomenon of excessive administrative personnel that was common in state-owned farms has been basically corrected nationwide through the rectification movement. The proportion of non-production personnel in many farms has been reduced from more than 10% or even more than 20% to about 2%. (Xinhua News Agency Special)

    在荒地上培育出花朵
    国营农牧场具有现代化设备，经营着大面积土地，完全按照国家计划生产，在农牧业生产中显示了优越性。
    我国国营农牧场企业已经从无到有、从小到大地发展壮大起来。目前仅农垦系统的国营农牧场（不包括专区、县所属的农场，下同）就已有七百一十处，耕地面积一千八百万亩，相当于第一个五年计划开始时全国农牧场耕地面积的三倍半。它们拥有的拖拉机也由1952年的一千七百多标准台增加到一万标准台。
    这些国营农牧场都是在荒地上建立起来的。几年来，在党的坚强领导和国家的财力物力支援下，职工们发扬坚苦奋斗、忘我劳动的精神，不分寒暑在东北沼泽地、西北干旱盐碱地、沿海盐碱地、长江流域的湖洼地、华南的红壤土地区，把荒野开垦成为良田，创建了成批成片的国营农牧场。这些国营农牧场因地制宜地经营谷物、畜牧、棉花、油料作物、橡胶、果树、茶桑、蔬菜等生产，为国家出产了相当数量的农畜产品。在第一个五年计划期间共计生产了四十亿斤粮食、四点八亿斤大豆、九十四万担棉花、九十万只猪，总产值十亿元，相当于这五年间国家对农垦企业基建投资的总额。另外还种植了大量的橡胶、剑麻、咖啡、香茅等热带和亚热带作物。
    我国的国营农牧场是经营大面积土地和用现代化技术装备的全民所有制的农业企业。它在全国农业中的比重虽然还很小，但是已经显示出更大的优越性。这是因为它是现代化的企业，产品的商品率高，能完全按照国家计划生产国家最迫切需要的农畜产品。几年来，国营农场的粮棉单位面积产量一般都高于当地农业社。1957年全国国营农场的小麦每亩平均产量比全国平均高20％，大豆高18％，棉花高69％，水稻由于几个主要产稻农场歉收稍低于全国平均产量（过去四年都高于全国平均产量）。1957年全国已经有二十九个农场达到或超过了粮食四、五、八百斤的指标，有四十八个农场达到六十、八十、一百斤皮棉的指标。几年来，各地国营农牧场在大农牧企业的经营管理上，在生产技术改革和机械化上也都对农业社起了程度不同的示范作用；另外还供应农业社九亿斤良种和三万多头优良种畜。
    解放军军官和战士是建设国营农牧场的一支主力，我国许多国营农牧场都是在全国解放后由军队开荒生产建设起来的。国营农牧场不但是社会劳动就业的一个重要场所；而且是解放军复员军人为建设社会主义立功的光荣劳动岗位。
    几年来，国营农场五万多名干部，积累了开荒生产和勤俭办场的经验，同时还查勘了八亿多亩荒地。这就为我国今后更多地开荒建场创造了有利条件。至于有些农场过去存在的经营管理不善，规章制度不合理，或技术措施不当，忽视因地制宜地发展多种经营等等影响农场生产提高和发展的问题，正在目前的整风运动中加以整改。国营农场原来普遍存在的管理人员过多的现象，经过整风运动已经在全国范围内基本改正了，许多农场的非生产人员的比例已由原来的10％以上甚至20％以上降低到了2％左右。（新华社专稿）
