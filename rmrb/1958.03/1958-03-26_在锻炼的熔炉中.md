Opening Up the World for the First Time

Gao Village in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, has always been a very dirty place.

At the end of last year, twenty-one transferred cadres came here. Soon after the new commune members arrived, the following blackboard notice appeared on the street:

　　Gao Village is a good place,
　　Vast fields and a thriving population;
　　There is one major shortcoming,
　　Street sanitation is too dirty;
　　The whole village, young and old, work together,
　　Transform the environment and change into new clothes;
　　Pay attention to hygiene and accumulate fertilizer,
　　A win-win situation for everyone.

Since then, these twenty-one comrades have gotten up before dawn every day to clean the courtyards, sweeping from inside the house to the street, and from the street to the village entrance. While taking the lead in cleaning, they also proposed a suggestion to the village Party organization: to carry out a large-scale cleaning campaign and use this dirt and garbage to accumulate fertilizer. Under the specific leadership of the Party organization and the impetus of the transferred cadres, a date was set for a village-wide cleanup. On this day, more than 700 people, young and old, from the whole village turned out, repairing, demolishing, and transporting. The women of Gao Village had never carried manure before, but seeing the new commune member Yan Jintong set an example, they also broke the old conventions and went to clean up the manure piles with the male commune members. Even the new daughter-in-law who had recently married into the village was attracted to participate in the ranks. In one day, not only were 1,174 carts of fertilizer accumulated, but the appearance of Gao Village was also completely renewed. An old man in his eighties walked through every street and alley in the village and said, stroking his beard:

　　"Gao Village's attention to hygiene is the first time since the creation of the world by Pangu." Since then, a comparison and inspection system has been established. Now, when transferred cadres sweep the floor, farmers are also busy taking dustpans to help pour soil. No one throws onion skins and vegetable leaves into the yard anymore. Wang Yinwa's family, who were notorious in the village for not paying attention to hygiene, have now developed the habit of cleaning the courtyard every day.

“Pig Doctor” Shows Great Skills

"Pig Doctor, King of Manure, King of Sparrows" are the nicknames given to Xu Yunfang, a transferred cadre, by the farmers of Zhoujiazhuang Township, Wuji County. It is not an exaggeration to call him that. After Comrade Xu Yunfang was transferred from the county to Zhoujiazhuang Township to serve as deputy secretary of the Party committee, he carried three treasures with him all day long: a health kit, a manure basket, and a shotgun. Whether he went to meetings or went to the countryside, he always carried a manure basket on his shoulder, a shotgun in the basket, and a health kit around his waist. Wherever he went, he picked up manure when he saw it, shot sparrows when he saw them, and gave medicine and injections to anyone's pig that was sick. Picking up manure and shooting birds was still easy, but treating pigs was not simple. Comrade Xu Yunfang was originally an outsider in this line of work. All of his skills came from seeking teachers, visiting friends, studying hard, and practicing diligently. Since the township proposed the leap forward plan of a thousand-pig commune and a ten-thousand-pig township, he has visited and studied everywhere. Now, he can almost freely use the needles, knives, syringes, and other tools and more than a dozen kinds of local medicines such as garlic, shoe sole ash, mirabilite, and salt in the health kit. Recently, he has cured three pigs in a row.

After the reputation of "Pig Doctor, King of Manure, King of Sparrows" spread, many township and commune cadres followed suit by carrying manure baskets and learning to treat pigs. This has greatly promoted the township's pig raising, fertilizer accumulation, and pest elimination campaign. Originally, one of commune member Yu Suozhu's pigs had bone disease. No matter how the commune cadres mobilized him to buy pigs, he still said: "Raising pigs is good, but I can't stand dead pigs." This time, the pig's disease was cured by Comrade Xu Yunfang. Without any mobilization, he automatically fed three more pigs. Now, the number of pigs raised in the township has increased rapidly. In one month, the number of pigs raised in the township's nine villages and 2,036 households increased from 2,026 to 4,480, resulting in a thousand-pig commune. In terms of eliminating the four pests, according to incomplete statistics, by the end of January, the township had caught 1,421 rats and shot 3,739 sparrows. (Ding Xiangzhi)

Risking Life to Block Water and Save Mine

At 2:00 p.m. on a certain day in December last year, the Li Xiaosi production team of the Second Well of the Fourth Coal Mine in the Tongchuan Mining Area, Shaanxi Province, was busy with production at the old North Zheng Tou working face underground. After drilling and blasting, when coal miners Ping Jianzhong and Wang Jinhai were just starting to dig coal with picks, suddenly a stream of mine water as thick as a teacup surged toward them. It turned out that this working face was close to an old pond more than 30 meters long, which contained a large amount of water, and there was only a three-inch thick coal wall between the water and the working face. For a time, the workers at the entire working face were a little flustered.

In less than half an hour, this shocking accident shocked the entire mine. The mine director immediately sent engineers and technicians down the well to rescue. At this time, Zhang Xixun, a transferred cadre, had just finished his shift and was sleeping when he learned about the incident. Without even bothering to get dressed properly, he followed the engineers down the well again. Seeing the situation, he carried a "big head" (water blocking tool) and walked towards the water source. The water got deeper and deeper, gradually submerging his rubber boots, thighs, and waist. The "big head" blocked the water source, but the water was still constantly flowing out from both sides.

At this critical moment, a strong sense of responsibility rushed to his heart: this working face is the main mining area of the entire well, and it is also located at a higher altitude. If the water continues to flow out like this, not only will the lives of more than 50 workers in this working face be in danger, but the entire well may be submerged. Thinking of this, he gritted his teeth and took off his clothes one by one, until he was only wearing a pair of shorts. In the cold December, the cold wind was whistling, and the water on the ground was freezing. Comrade Zhang Xixun stood in the icy water, as if he saw everything around him spinning. His hands were swollen from the cold, and his lips turned blue, but he finally used cotton clothes to block the water source, and the water slowly subsided. As soon as Engineer Li had people support him out without even standing steady, the workers surrounded him, shaking his hand and patting his shoulder, saying: "Old Zhang! Thanks to you risking your life and enduring the cold to block the water source, otherwise the lives of all the miners in the entire mine would have been over!"

Rescuing Children in Icy River

One winter morning, Comrade Geng Wei, a transferred cadre from the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China, was working hard on the land of Zhangjiazhui Village, Shangguozhuang Township, Dongjiao District, Tianjin City, his new hometown. Suddenly, he heard someone shouting "Help!" from the river ditch in the distance. Comrade Geng Wei anxiously searched for the sound, and found that a little boy had fallen into the river ditch and was struggling. A female commune member had already jumped into the water to rescue him, but had not yet reached the child. At this time, Comrade Geng Wei jumped into the river ditch without hesitation, wearing his cotton clothes. The river water in winter was icy cold, immediately submerging to his chest and soaking his entire body. Comrade Geng Wei dragged the child with one hand and held the bank with the other, rescuing the child. He didn't seem to feel his own wetness and cold, and directly sent the child back home. This was an only child, and the child's parents were very moved. They took out new cotton clothes and insisted on giving them to Comrade Geng Wei to wear. The comrades also persuaded him to rest and not go to work in the afternoon, but he did not agree and participated in the labor as usual. (Ke Ren) (Attached picture)

    在锻炼的熔炉中
    开天辟地头一次
    山西省太原市郊区郜村一向是很脏的地方。
    去年年底，这里来了二十一位下放干部。新社员来到不久，街头上就出现了这样一块黑板报：
    郜村是个好地方，
    田野辽阔人烟旺；
    眼前有个大缺点，
    街道卫生太肮脏；
    全村老少齐动手，
    改造环境换新装；
    讲了卫生又积肥，
    两全其美喜洋洋。
    自此以后，这二十一个同志每天天不亮就起来清扫庭院，从屋内扫到街上，从街上扫到村口，一面带头清扫，一面又向村里党组织提出一项建议：开展清洁大扫除，利用这土垃圾积肥。在党组织的具体领导和下放干部的带动下，选定了一个日子来了个全村性的大扫除。这天，全村老少七百多人一起出动，整修的整修，拆除的拆除，运送的运送。郜村的妇女是从来不挑粪的，见新社员阎晋通开了先例，也都打破了陈规，和男社员们一起去清理粪堆了，甚至连不久前娶到村的新媳妇也被吸引出来参加了这个行列。一天工夫不但积肥一千一百七十四车，而且使郜村面貌焕然一新。一位八十多岁的老大爷把全村大街小巷串了个遍，摸着胡子说：
  “郜村讲卫生是盘古以来开天辟地头一次。”自此以后，并订了评比检查制度，现在，下放干部扫地，农民们也忙着拿簸箕来帮忙倒土了，谁家有什么葱皮菜叶也不往院子里扔了，社员王银娃全家不讲卫生是村里出名的，现在也养成了天天清扫庭院的习惯。
    “猪大夫”大显神通
    “猪医生、粪大王、麻雀阎王”这是无极县周家庄乡农民给下放干部徐云芳所加的绰号。人们这么称呼他，一点也不算夸张。徐云芳同志从县里下放到周家庄乡来当党委副书记以后，整天随身不离三样宝：保健箱，粪筐，鸟枪，无论是去开会或下乡走动，他无不是肩上背着粪筐，筐里插着鸟枪，腰里带着保健箱。走到哪里，见粪就拾粪，见麻雀就放枪，谁家的猪要是生了病，他就给吃药打针。拾粪、打鸟倒还容易，给猪治病可不简单，徐云芳同志对这一行原也是个门外汉，这一点本领全靠求师访友，勤学苦练来的。自从乡里提出千猪社、万猪乡的跃进计划以后，他到处参观、学习。现在，保健箱里装着的针、刀、注射器等几种用具和白皮蒜、鞋底灰、皮硝、食盐等十多种土药，他已差不多可以运用自如了，近些时，他一连治好了三口猪。
    “猪医生、粪大王、麻雀阎王”的名声传来以后，不少乡社干部都跟着背上粪筐、学习给猪治病了。这样就大大推动了全乡养猪积肥和除四害运动。原来，社员于锁柱的一口猪得了骨眼病，社干们再怎么动员他买猪，他还是说：“养猪好是好，就是死猪受不了。”这次，这口猪的病被徐云芳同志治好了，没用动员，他就自动又喂了三口猪。现在，全乡养猪头数迅速上升，一个月的时间，全乡九村二千零三十六户，养猪由二千零二十六口增加到四千四百八十口，出现了一个千猪社。在除四害方面，据不完全统计，到1月底为止，全乡已捕鼠一千四百二十一只，打麻雀三千七百三十九只。　　（丁祥志）
    冒险堵水救矿井
    去年12月某日两点钟，陕西铜川矿区第四煤矿二井口李小四生产班在井下老北正头工作面正忙着生产，眼打完，炮放罢，采煤工平建中、王金海刚开始用洋镐刨煤的时候，忽然有像茶碗口粗的一股井水汹涌地向他们二人扑来。原来，这个工作面紧靠着一个三十多公尺长的老塘，里面积有大量的水，水与工作面之间仅仅隔着三寸厚的一层煤墙。一时间，全工作面的工人们都有些慌乱了。
    没半个钟头，这件惊人的事故轰动了全矿，矿长即速派工程师、技术员下井抢救。这时，下放干部张希巡，刚当完班正在睡觉，也知道了这件事，他连衣裳也未顾得穿整齐，就跟着工程师一块又下了井。一看这情景，他扛了一个“大包头”（堵水工具）就向水眼走去，水越走越深，逐渐没了他的胶靴、大腿、腰部。大包头把水眼堵住了，可是水还是不断的从两边向外流。
    就在这紧要关头，一种强烈的责任感冲上了他的心头：这工作面是全井的主要采区，而且地势较高，水再像这样往外流，不但这个工作面五十多个工人生命难保，全井都有被淹没的危险，他想到这里，一咬牙，一件又一件地脱掉了自己身上的衣裳，直到只剩下一条短裤?。严冬的12月，寒风飕飕，地面上的水都结了冰。张希巡同志站在刺骨的水里，好像看见周围一切在旋转，他的手被冻肿了，嘴唇也发青了，但他终于用棉衣把水眼堵住，水慢慢小了。李工程师让人把他架了出来还没有站稳脚，工人都团团把他包围住了，这个和他握手，那个拍他的肩膀说：“老张！多亏你冒着生命受冷把水眼堵住，不然那全矿井工人的生命可完啦！”
    冰河中抢救儿童
    一个冬日的上午，中国人民银行天津市分行的下放干部耿维同志，正在他新到不久的家乡——天津市东郊区上郭庄乡张家咀村的土地上，紧张地劳动。忽然听到远处的河沟边有人高喊“救命！”。耿维同志紧张地寻着喊声找去，原来是一个小男孩掉到河沟里，正在挣扎。一个女社员已经跳下水去营救，但是还没有摸到孩子。这时，耿维同志奋不顾身，穿着棉衣就往河沟里跳。入冬的河水，冰冷彻骨，顿时淹没到胸前，浸透了全身衣服。耿维同志一手拖着孩子，一手扶着岸，把孩子救了上来，仿佛没有感觉到自己的湿冷，又迳直把孩子送回了家。这是一个独生子，孩子的父母非常感动。他们把新棉衣拿出来，一定要给耿维同志穿上，同志们也劝他休息休息，下午不要去劳动了，但他都没有答应，照样参加了劳动。
