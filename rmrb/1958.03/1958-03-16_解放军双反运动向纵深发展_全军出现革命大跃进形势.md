    Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The rectification upsurge in the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), using anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the guiding principles to promote a Great Leap Forward in all tasks, is reaching a new peak. Leaders of all units are personally taking charge, fully mobilizing the broad masses, with millions of big-character posters simultaneously launching fierce attacks on waste, conservatism, and the "five airs." An unprecedented revolutionary leap forward situation of comparing progressiveness and drive has emerged in the troops.
    The Shanghai Garrison, under the slogan "Burn together from top to bottom and left to right, burn thoroughly in all directions, and advance victoriously with renewed efforts," is progressing rapidly and vigorously. From late February to March 7, the number of big-character posters put up by various units has exceeded ten million. As of March 10, the Navy units had posted over 23 million big-character posters. After the leading organs of the Nanjing Military Region held an emergency mobilization meeting on the afternoon of the 4th, more than 30,000 big-character posters were put up that night. By midnight on the 6th, the number of big-character posters had increased to over 700,000.
    Currently, in the Air Force, the Nanjing Military Region, the Guangzhou Military Region, the Fujian Front and other units, a magnificent anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is rapidly developing in depth. Party committees and leaders at all levels of the troops check the progress of the movement in various units every day, and organize visits, appraisals, and competitions in a timely manner. The troops have also carried out activities such as clearing warehouses, exhibiting physical objects, holding appraisal meetings, and reporting good news about the new atmosphere. The countless big-character posters not only leave various forms of waste, conservatism, and the "five airs" with nowhere to hide, but also put forward many advanced initiatives and indicators.
    Revolutionary competitions comparing drive, progressiveness, politics, methods, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economically are rapidly unfolding in the troops. Many units have repeatedly reduced their budget estimates; training, work, and teaching indicators have been raised again and again; and the work style of leading cadres personally engaging in "experimental companies" and going deep into the troops to guide work is beginning to take shape. A certain aviation school of the Air Force, by adopting methods such as independently organizing maintenance battalions, unified allocation and use of aircraft, changing personnel but not aircraft, and double-route flying, has doubled or tripled its training indicators. The training indicators of the Shenyang Military Region broke through twice in one month. The leading organs and leading cadres of many units have established a new work style. Recently, a certain department of the General Staff Department has drawn 80% of its organ cadres to form thirteen working groups, which will go to seventeen provincial and municipal military service bureaus to help and inspect work.

    解放军双反运动向纵深发展
    全军出现革命大跃进形势
    本报特约新华社专稿　中国人民解放军全军以反浪费反保守为纲、推动各项工作大跃进的整改热潮正推向新的高峰。各部队首长都亲自挂帅，把广大群众充分发动起来，千百万张大字报一齐向浪费、保守和“五气”猛攻，部队中出现了前所未有的比先进、比干劲的革命跃进形势。
    上海驻军在“上下左右一齐烧，四面八方都烧透，再接再厉乘胜前进”的口号下，运动进展迅速勇猛。从2月下旬到3月7日，各单位贴出的大字报已经超过一千多万张。海军各部队到3月10日，已贴出大字报二千三百多万张。南京部队领导机关在4日下午召开了紧急动员大会后，当天夜里就贴出了三万多张大字报，到6日午夜，大字报又增至七十多万张。
    现在，空军、南京、广州、福建前线等部队，波澜壮阔的反浪费反保守运动正在迅速地向纵深发展。部队各级党委和首长，每天检查各单位的运动进展情况，并及时组织参观、评比，发动竞赛。各部队还进行了清查仓库、展览实物、召开评比会和新气象报喜会等活动。成千累万的大字报，不仅把形形色色的浪费、保守和“五气”烧得无处藏身，而且提出了许多先进的倡议和指标。
    比干劲、比先进、比政治、比方法、比多快好省的革命竞赛，正在各部队迅速开展起来。很多部队的经费预算一再削减；训练、工作、教学等指标一次再次提高；领导干部亲自搞“试验连”、深入部队指导工作的作风正在开始形成。空军某航校由于采取了单独组织机务大队、统一调配使用飞机、换人不换飞机和双航线飞行等方法，使训练指标提高了一倍到二倍。沈阳部队训练指标在一个月内就突破了二次。很多部队领导机关和领导干部都树立了新的工作作风。总参谋部某部最近已抽出80％的机关干部，组成十三个工作组，分别到十七个省、市兵役局去帮助、检查工作。
