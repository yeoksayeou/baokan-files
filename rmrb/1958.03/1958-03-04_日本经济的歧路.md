    The Crossroads of the Japanese Economy
    Japan　Ōuchi Hyōe
    A quarter of a century has passed since Japan waged war against the whole world. An eighth of a century has also passed since Japan surrendered after its defeat in that war. In the first half of that eighth of a century, the Japanese economy had apparently been expanding continuously, but in reality, it was shrinking constantly. This was entirely due to the war economy. The war economy is unproductive at any time, especially when defeated. The day Japan announced its surrender in 1945 most clearly exposed this point. At that time, Japan's industry and mining had decreased to less than one-third of the pre-war level. Most of the capital accumulated by the Japanese over half a century—production equipment and living equipment—had been destroyed. With this destruction and reduced production capacity, the Japanese lost their means of livelihood, and almost everyone was malnourished and struggling on the brink of starvation.
    The twelve years after the war were finally spent in peace. During this period, the Japanese economy recovered rapidly. For example, in 1955, the tenth year after the war, the Japanese economy had roughly recovered to the pre-war (1934-1936) level. During this period, the population increased by 30%. The growth of agriculture was roughly the same as the rate of population growth. The growth of industry and mining greatly exceeded the pre-war level, reaching 187%. The national standard of living also recovered to the pre-war level, or slightly higher.
    It was already like this in 1955, and from 1956 to the first half of 1957, the Japanese economy showed an extraordinary boom on the surface. People called it the "Jimmu Boom." This means that it was a boom that had never occurred since the age of mythology. During this period, Japan's production activities, especially industry and mining, developed rapidly, and agriculture also achieved bumper harvests for three consecutive years due to favorable weather. In addition, foreign exports, which had stagnated after the war, also increased significantly. The total export volume in 1956 reached 3.6 billion US dollars, which was close to the pre-war level. The Japanese ruling class and the government, seeing this good economic situation, seemed to be a little too happy. They mistakenly believed that the Japanese economy could maintain this growth rate, which ranked first in the capitalist world, because the Japanese economy had a sound foundation. They believed that Japan should now strive to modernize its economy technologically and take this opportunity to make up for the more than ten years of backwardness caused by the war, so as to re-enter the world competition arena.
    However, this idea is unfounded. Although the Japanese economy has recovered to the pre-war level in terms of production capacity, in terms of its structure and organization, and in terms of the surrounding conditions, it is still very fragile and has many shortcomings compared with the major countries in the world. Therefore, it is not so simple to modernize the Japanese economy and catch up with the industrial technology level of the United States and the Soviet Union, or even just catch up with the industrial technology level of Germany and the United Kingdom. They soon saw this. At the same time, they also saw that it would be very difficult for the Japanese economy to continue to maintain the prosperity and development speed of the past two or three years in the next few years. Because, although the expansionary policies they adopted produced the so-called "Jimmu Boom," at the same time, factors that negated the boom also appeared sharply in this good economic situation. The "Jimmu Boom" itself was a fleeting illusion. It may be useful to explain this fact in more detail: The central link of the expansionary policy from 1956 to 1957 was to expand equipment investment, and the primary purpose of expanding equipment investment was to increase exports. It is precisely because of this that the Japanese government has drastically expanded the scale of military industry, metal industry, and textile industry. For this purpose, they invested the capital accumulated in the past few years after the war into these industrial sectors, so the "Jimmu Boom" quickly appeared. In 1956, the growth rate of industrial and mining production was 23.4%, exceeding that of the United States, Britain, France, Italy and other countries. In this year, Japan's export growth rate was 25%, which also ranked first among capitalist countries. However, there are problems with this high growth rate. The industrial sectors that have become the center of Japan's industrial upsurge, such as metal, iron, electricity, and textile industries, need to rely on foreign countries, especially the United States, for their raw materials, necessary power sources (oil, coal, electricity), and machinery due to the special circumstances after the war. Therefore, the more Japan expands these industrial equipment, the more US dollars it needs. But what was the situation of Japan's exports in 1956 and 1957? Although there was a considerable increase, the absolute increase was, after all, not as large as the absolute increase in imports. In 1957, there was a big imbalance. This imbalance formed a large shortage of US dollars as the price for necessary imports. This is the sad result of the "Jimmu Boom." According to the government's calculations, Japan's international balance of payments deficit in 1957 reached 533 million US dollars.
    With such an international balance of payments situation, it is obvious that the import of all raw materials and power will become impossible, and thus, the planned expansion of enterprises will also become impossible. As a result, the ruling class and the Kishi Cabinet panicked. The Kishi Cabinet changed its policy last June based on this situation. The government not only admitted that the equipment investment plan previously made in finance was too large, and thus decided to reduce it, but also raised the interest rate of the Bank of Japan and adopted a tight monetary policy.
    This policy change has, of course, caused chaos in all aspects of the country. The first is that many projects have stalled. From last autumn to the beginning of this year, the scramble for business funds and the competition for sales have intensified. Now, a large number of bounced checks have appeared in the financial sector, banks have seen loans exceeding absorbed deposits, and the industry has successively shortened operating rates. For example, the operating rate of the textile industry has been shortened by more than 50%, and the shortening of the operating rate of other important industrial sectors has also reached about 30%. Despite this, the product inventory of these industrial sectors is increasing day by day. The prices of these industrial sector products have also fallen month by month, breaking through the constraints of the cartel, and many products are now being sold on the market below the cost of production.
    The government's draft budget for the 1958 fiscal year is currently being reviewed by the parliament. The Kishi Cabinet is betting its fate on this draft and is doing its best to promote its passage. On the other hand, this is also out of the need to tighten finances. To this end, social insurance premiums and education expenses have been greatly reduced. The government is trying to prevent inflation and excessive imports through this budget. However, in this way, the various undertakings that have relied on government subsidies in the past will become more and more difficult. The government still has to increase expenditure in these areas. For example, the military pension issue has been increased by 33 billion yen throughout the year according to the requirements of the former soldiers, and the total amount of pensions throughout the year has reached 120 billion yen, accounting for 10% of the entire budget. The Kishi Cabinet believes that this is a last resort in order to expand military preparations. Therefore, although a tightening policy has been established on the one hand, the budget for the 1958 fiscal year actually contains a considerable degree of inflationary risk. At present, in the parliament, the opposition party is criticizing the government's budget for being unremarkable. Of course, the Kishi Cabinet is the cabinet of the majority party, and the budget will eventually be passed, but after its passage, the Kishi Cabinet's prestige will undoubtedly decline more and more.
    The Kishi government's goal this year is to achieve exports of more than 3.15 billion US dollars. Judging from the current situation, this goal is difficult to achieve. In order to achieve this goal, the countries that import Japanese goods must have greater purchasing power this year than last year. However, the economic situation in the so-called liberal countries this year has retreated compared with last year, and it is obviously unlikely to expect these countries to buy more Japanese goods than last year. Moreover, the declining trend of the US economy is also becoming increasingly certain and prolonged. In this way, Japan's recession also has the risk of becoming certain and prolonged. Because, after the war, Japan's dependence on the United States has increased in all aspects, especially in terms of exports. Japan lost its sales channels in China and North Korea before the war, and is now using the US market as compensation. Therefore, Japan's economy will also be transferred by the US economy. In order to prevent the decline of its own economy, the United States is taking a more stringent attitude towards Japanese goods by raising tariff barriers to exclude and restrict them. In this way, the recovery of Japan's economic prosperity will be subject to more severe American political pressure than before.
    In short, in the twelve years after the war, the Japanese economy has apparently completed the process of recovery, but at the same time as the completion, Japan is facing an unprecedentedly profound crisis. This crisis is probably similar in nature to the world's total crisis after 1929. Maybe it will be deeper and take longer. It is still unclear to determine the full picture of its nature because it is still in the early stages of development. However, the Japanese economy is already trembling for its future in the face of this crisis. The current Kishi Cabinet has completely lost the support of the people due to this economic situation.

    日本经济的歧路
    日本　大内兵卫
    自从日本以全世界为对手掀起战争，已经过了四分之一世纪。日本在这场战争中战败投降之后，也过了八分之一世纪。在前一半八分之一世纪里，日本经济表面上曾经不断扩张，但实质上却在不断缩小。因为这完全是战争经济。战争经济在任何时候都是非生产的，特别是在战败的时候尤其如此。1945年日本宣布投降之日，最明显不过地暴露了这点。当时，日本的工矿业已减少到战前的三分之一以下。日本人半个世纪以来积蓄的资本——生产设备、生活设备的大半均已遭到破坏。在这种破坏和生产能力减弱的情况下，日本人失去了生活手段，几乎所有的人都陷于营养失调，挣扎于饥饿线上。
    战后的十二年总算是在和平中度过的。在这个期间，日本经济迅速地恢复起来。例如，1955年，即战后第十个年头，日本经济已大致恢复到战前（1934—1936年）水平。这个期间人口增加了30％。农业的增长同人口增长的比率大致相同。而工矿业的增长则大大超过了战前，达到187％。国民生活水平也恢复到了战前程度，或稍高一些。
    1955年已经如此，从1956年到1957年上半年，日本经济表面上更呈现了非同寻常的好景气。人们称之为“神武景气”。意思是说，这是自从神话时代以来从没有出现过的好景气。这个期间，日本的生产活动，特别是工矿业有了急速的发展，农业也由于风调雨顺连续三年获得丰收。此外，战后停滞不前的对外输出，也有了很大增长。1956年输出总额达三十六亿美元，已接近战前水平。日本的统治阶级和政府，看到这种好景气，似乎有点高兴得忘其所以了。他们误以为日本经济能够保有这种占资本主义世界首位的增长率，是由于日本经济有着健全的基础。他们认为现在日本应该力求使其经济在技术上现代化，趁此时机挽回战争所造成的落后十几年的状态，以便重新登上世界竞争的舞台。
    但是，这种想法是没有根据的。日本经济在生产能力上虽已恢复到战前水平，但就其结构和组织来说，就其所处的周围条件来说，同世界各个大国相比，还很脆弱，而且缺点很多。因此，要使日本经济现代化，赶上美国和苏联的工业技术水平，或者仅仅赶上德国和英国的工业技术水平，都不是那么简单的。他们很快地就看到了这点。同时，他们也看到，要使日本经济在今后几年里，继续维持最近两三年的繁荣情况和发展速度，也是很困难的。因为，他们所采取的膨胀政策虽然产生了所谓“神武景气”，但是就在这种好景气里，同时也急剧地出现了否定好景气的因素。“神武景气”本身就是一个昙花一现的幻影。下面不妨把这一事实再详加说明一下：从1956年到1957年的膨胀政策的中心环节，是扩大设备投资，而扩大设备投资的首要目的，是为了增加输出。正因为如此，日本政府才急剧地扩大了军需工业、金属工业、纤维工业的规模。他们为了这一目的，向这些工业部门投入了战后几年来积蓄的资本，因此才迅速地出现了“神武景气”。1956年，工矿业生产的增长率是23.4％，超过了美、英、法、意等国。这一年，日本输出的增长率是25％，也占了资本主义国家的首位。然而，在这种很高的增长率中却不是没有问题的。成为日本工业高涨中心的，例如金属、铁、电力、纤维等工业部门，由于战后的特殊情况，其原料、必要的动力来源（石油、煤、电力）以及机械等，都需要仰给于外国，特别是美国。因此，日本越扩大这些工业设备，就越需要大量的美元。但1956年、1957年日本的输出情况如何呢？虽然有相当的增加，但就其绝对增加额来说，毕竟赶不上输入的绝对增加额。1957年出现了很大的不平衡。这种不平衡形成了作为必要的输入品支付代价的美元的大量缺乏。这是“神武景气”的可悲结果。据政府的计算，1957年日本国际收支的赤字达五亿三千三百万美元。
    国际收支情况如此，很显然，一切原料、动力的输入都将成为不可能，从而，计划中的事业的扩张，也将成为不可能。于是，统治阶级、岸内阁惊慌起来了。去年6月，岸内阁改变了政策，就是基于这种情况的。政府不仅承认以前在财政上所作的设备投资计划过大，从而决定加以缩减，并且提高了日本银行的利率，采取了金融紧缩措施。
    这种政策的转变，当然在国内的各个方面都引起了混乱。首先是许多事业停顿下来了。从去年秋天到今年初，事业资金的争夺和抛售竞争加剧了。现在，金融界出现了大量空头支票，银行出现了贷款超过吸收的存款的现象，工业界相继缩短开工率。例如，纤维工业开工率已缩短50％以上，其他重要工业部门开工率的缩短也达30％左右。尽管如此，而这些工业部门的产品库存却与日俱增。这些工业部门产品的价格，也突破了卡迭尔的约束逐月下跌，其中已有很多产品的市场价格正在降低到生产成本以下。
    1958年度的政府预算草案，目前正在议会审议，岸内阁把它的命运押在这个草案上，正在尽全力促其通过。另一方面这也是出于紧缩财政的必要。为此，社会保险费和教育费都已大大削减。政府企图通过这个预算来防止通货膨胀，防止过量的输入。但是，这样一来，过去仰仗政府补助的各项事业就将越来越困窘。政府在这些方面仍不得不增加支出。例如，军人年金问题，已根据旧军人的要求，全年增加了三百三十亿日元，年金全年总额已达一千二百亿日元，占整个预算的10％。岸内阁认为为了扩充军备，这是迫不得已的。因此，虽然一方面树立了紧缩方针，但实际上1958年度的预算却包含了相当程度的通货膨胀的危险。目前，在议会里，在野党正针对这点指责政府预算是没有特点的。当然，岸内阁是多数党的内阁，最后预算是会通过的，但通过之后，岸内阁的声价无疑地也会越来越下降。
    岸政府今年的目标，是要使输出达到三十一亿五千万美元以上。照目前情况看，这个目标是很难达到的。为了达到这个目标，输入日本商品的国家，今年的购买力要比去年更大才行。可是，所谓自由主义国家，今年的经济情况却比去年后退了，指望这些国家能比去年更多地购买日本商品，显然可能性不大。而且美国经济的衰落趋势也日益确实化、长期化了。这样，日本的不景气也有随之确实化、长期化的危险。因为，战后日本在各个方面对美国的从属性都增加了，特别在输出方面更是如此。日本失掉了战前在中国和朝鲜的销路，现在正以美国市场来作为补偿。因之日本的景气也将以美国的景气为转移。而美国为了防止本国经济的衰落，对于日本商品又正采取提高关税壁垒，加以排斥和限制的态度。这样，日本经济景气的恢复，就将受到比以前更加严厉的美国政治的压力。
    总之，战后十二年来，日本经济表面上已经完成了复兴的过程，但在完成的同时，日本又面临了前所未见的深刻的危机。这次危机，在性质上恐怕是和1929年以后世界的总危机相似的。也许会比那次危机更深刻，时间拖得更长。现在还看不清可以明确断定它的性质的全貌，是因为它还处在发展的初期阶段。但是，日本的经济已经在这场危机面前为自己的未来而战栗不已了。现在的岸内阁，正是由于这种经济情况，已经完全失掉国民的支持了。
