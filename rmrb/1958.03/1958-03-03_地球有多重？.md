    How Heavy is the Earth?
    Scientists have determined more than once using various methods that the Earth weighs 5,974,000,000,000 billion tons.
    How did scientists determine the weight of the Earth?
    Astronomers were the first to start measuring the weight of the Earth. They mainly determined the weight of the Earth based on the principle of the Earth revolving around the sun and the moon revolving around the Earth. It is important to know that this rotation relies on the force of the sun attracting the Earth and the Earth attracting the moon, and this attraction relies on the mutual attraction of a large amount of matter. The results of such observation and calculation provided the first answer to the weight of the Earth.
    Subsequently, physicists also calculated this problem using two methods:
    The first method is that they observed the speed of pendulum swing near the equator and in the Arctic region. As a result, the pendulum swings slower at the equator; the closer it is to the poles, the faster the pendulum swings. This is because the Earth is flatter near the poles, so the distance from there to the Earth's center is about twenty kilometers closer. The gravity on the ground is greater than the gravity closer to the Earth's center.
    Based on the physicists' observation of the pendulum swing, a series of complex calculations were completed, and the answer obtained further confirmed the correctness of the astronomers' answer.
    Another method for physicists to solve this problem is to observe the attraction of the Earth to a metal ball of a certain weight. This method can derive a third answer, which is similar to the first and second answers.

    地球有多重？
    科学家们不止一次地用各种方法测定出地球重量为5974000000000亿吨。
    科学家们是怎样测定出地球的重量的呢？
    最先着手测定地球重量的是天文学家。他们主要是根据地球绕太阳旋转和月亮绕地球旋转的原理来测定地球的重量。要知道，这种旋转是依靠太阳吸引地球及地球吸引月亮的力量，而这种吸引力又依靠大量物质的相互吸引。这样观察和计算的结果便破天荒第一次得到了地球重量的答案。
    随后物理学家也对这个问题进行了计算，是用两个方法算出来的：
    第一个方法是，他们在赤道附近和北极地带观察钟摆摆动的速度。结果，在赤道上钟摆摆动的较慢一些；离两极越近的地方钟摆摆动的越快。这是因为靠两极的地球偏一些，所以由那里到地球中心大约要近二十公里。地面上的重力比靠近地球中心的地方的重力大一些。
    根据物理学家对钟摆摆动的观察，完成了一系列复杂的计算，得出的答案更加证实了天文学家答案的正确性。
    物理学家解决这一问题的另一方法是：观察一个有一定重量的金属球被地球吸引的情况。用这个方法可以得出第三个答案，和第一、第二两个答案相似。
