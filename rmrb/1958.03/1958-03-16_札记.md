　　Jottings

　　Predicament
　　U.S. Senator Fulbright questioned Smith, Assistant Secretary for the Department of Commerce, on the 13th, asking if the U.S. embargo would largely fail if China and Japan signed a trade agreement. Smith then closed his eyes and fabricated an answer, saying that China did not have much financial resources to purchase imports, implying that the problem was not serious.
　　However, this led to another question from Fulbright, who said, then why is the United States "going to the trouble" of maintaining the embargo? Smith replied: "This is a political issue."
　　Obviously, Smith's embarrassment in this Q&A is extremely ridiculous. Because, in any case, he is essentially admitting that the U.S. embargo policy is indeed a stupid thing that is "asking for trouble."

　　Birds of a Feather
　　Recently, Dulles stated that the U.S. State Department would study the issue of the "belligerent status" of the Padang rebel group. A day later, a British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain did not intend to recognize the "belligerent status" of this rebel group. At first glance, Britain's opinion seems to be the exact opposite of the United States'. But in reality, they are the same. The reason is that Britain is thinking: if such a "belligerent status" is recognized, it would be equivalent to admitting that "the belligerent parties have the right to prohibit foreign ships from passing through"; and the Indonesian government, in order to prevent foreign aid to the rebel group, had already ordered the blockade of the rebel area, which in Britain's view, is of course detrimental to foreign intervention.
　　The United States wants to recognize the rebel group in order to facilitate further intervention in Indonesia; Britain does not want to recognize the rebel group, also in order to facilitate further intervention in Indonesia. Although the words spoken by the imperialists are varied, they are ultimately birds of a feather on the issue of opposing national independence movements.

　　Unable to Help Oneself
　　According to "Agence France-Presse", several French ministers unanimously raised a question to Gaillard: Doesn't he think that the plan to conclude the Western Mediterranean Pact contains the danger of internationalizing the Algerian issue? Gaillard's answer was: He himself is also against internationalizing the Algerian issue, so he does not intend to go too fast or too far.
　　From this simple dialogue, people can clearly see that concluding the Western Mediterranean Pact is not beneficial to France. Gaillard put forward this proposition under duress; in fact, he is prepared to adopt a passive attitude towards his own "initiative."
　　However, exactly how fast and how far Gaillard will go in the future cannot be decided by himself. Now that he has to put forward a plan that he opposes after looking at Dulles' face, will he dare to defy Washington's will and act according to his own plans in the future?

    札记
    困境
    美国参议员富布赖特13日向美国商务部的助理部长帮办史密斯提出质问说，如果中国和日本签订一项贸易协定，美国的禁运会不会大部分失效。史密斯于是闭起眼睛来胡诌说，中国没有多大财力来购买进口品，言下之意似乎是问题并不严重。
    但是，这一来，却引起富布赖特的另一个问题，他说，那么，美国为什么要“自找麻烦”来保持禁运呢？史密斯答复说：“这是一个政治问题”。
    显然，史密斯在这场问答中的窘态是极端可笑的。因为，无论如何，他总是等于承认美国的禁运政策的确是一件“自找麻烦”的蠢事。
    一丘之貉
    最近杜勒斯曾表示，美国国务院将要研究巴东叛乱集团的“交战地位”问题。过了一天，英国外交部发言人声明说，英国却不打算承认这个叛乱集团的“交战地位”。乍看起来，英国同美国的意见似乎是恰恰相反的。但实际上却是一样的。原来英国想的是：如果承认了这种“交战地位”，也就等于承认“交战双方有权禁止外国船只通过”；而印度尼西亚政府为了防止外国接济叛乱集团，早已下令封锁叛乱地区，这在英国看来，当然是不利于外国干涉的。
    美国想承认叛乱集团，是为了便于进一步干涉印度尼西亚；英国不想承认叛乱集团，也是为了便于进一步干涉印度尼西亚。帝国主义者口里讲的话尽管也有种种不同，但是他们在反对民族独立运动这一点上，终归是一丘之貉。
    由不得自己
    据“法新社”透露，法国有好几个部长一致向盖伊阿提出了一个问题：难道他不认为缔结西地中海公约的计划含有使阿尔及利亚问题国际化的危险吗？盖伊阿的回答是：他自己也反对使阿尔及利亚问题国际化，因此并不打算走得太快、太远。
    从这段简单的对话里，人们可以清楚地看到，缔结西地中海公约对法国并不有利。盖伊阿在一种不得已的情况下才提出了这种主张；实际上他对自己的“倡议”是准备采取消极怠工态度的。
    但是，究竟盖伊阿今后走得多快、多远，并不能由他自己来决定。既然现在他看了杜勒斯的脸色就不得不提出自己所反对的计划，难道今后就敢于违抗华盛顿的意志而按自己的打算办事吗？
