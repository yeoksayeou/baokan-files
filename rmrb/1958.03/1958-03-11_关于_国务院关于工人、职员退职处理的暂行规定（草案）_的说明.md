Explanation on the "Provisional Regulations (Draft) of the State Council on Handling the Resignation of Workers and Staff"
Minister of Labor of the People's Republic of China, Ma Wenrui

Regarding the resignation of workers and staff, the "Provisional Measures for Handling the Resignation of Personnel of State Organs" issued by the State Council at the end of 1955, and the "Provisional Measures (Draft) for Handling the Resignation of Workers and Staff of State-Owned Enterprises" issued on a trial basis by the former Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council at the beginning of 1952, both made provisions. However, because these two measures were not publicly released, they were not understood by the vast majority of employees; in the past, various units did not pay enough attention to this work and did not implement it conscientiously; in addition, some of the provisions of the original measures were not entirely appropriate. For example, the resignation conditions stipulated in the "Provisional Measures (Draft) for Handling the Resignation of Workers and Staff of State-Owned Enterprises" were too restrictive (limited to employees who were physically weak and unable to work, and who did not meet the retirement conditions, and who voluntarily requested resignation), and the treatment standards for resignation were too low (the maximum resignation subsidy was no more than twelve months of the individual's total wages). As a result, many employees who should have resigned were unable or unwilling to resign. Some employees who had already resigned were treated differently. Some were treated according to the aforementioned two measures, while others formulated their own measures and implemented them after obtaining the consent of the higher-level competent authorities or local labor departments. Employees had some opinions on this. Therefore, there is currently a great need to re-formulate a more practical resignation method that can be uniformly implemented by enterprises and agencies, and appropriately stipulate the conditions and treatment standards for employee resignation, in order to properly handle the resignation of workers and staff, so that resigned personnel can receive appropriate arrangements and care, and also achieve the purpose of improving labor organization and improving production and work efficiency.

According to the newly formulated regulations, employees who need to be handled for resignation fall into the following categories:

One situation is that they are old and infirm, and after being certified by the labor appraisal committee or a doctor as unable to continue their original work, there is indeed no light work to be assigned in the enterprise or agency, and they do not meet the retirement conditions. These employees generally have a short length of service and do not meet the conditions for enjoying retirement benefits. However, these employees are actually unable to continue working. If they remain in their production or work posts, it will not only be detrimental to streamlining and improving institutions and improving production and work efficiency, but also inappropriate for their own health. If they are realistically handled for resignation and given a certain amount of resignation subsidy, allowing them to rest peacefully after resignation or engage in some sideline production or domestic auxiliary labor, it would be more appropriate for the country and themselves.

Another situation is that the individual voluntarily resigns, and their resignation does not hinder the production or work of the unit. The voluntary resignation of these employees may be because their conditions are not suitable for their current job, or they are willing to seek other jobs (such as returning to their hometown to engage in agricultural production), or they are willing to return home to engage in housework due to family needs. As long as they can be spared from production or work, they can resign. However, individual employees who cannot be spared from production or work, if they disregard overall interests and insist on leaving for personal purposes, should be treated as resignation or automatic resignation, and cannot be handled according to resignation and should not enjoy the benefits stipulated in these regulations. Such a restriction is necessary to consolidate labor discipline.

Another situation is that employees who have worked for a short period of time (continuous working years of less than three years) have stopped working for a long time (more than one year) due to illness or non-work-related injuries. These employees have not contributed much to production or work, but the burden on the unit is very heavy. When they have been treated in the unit for more than a year and still cannot recover and participate in work, they should be handled for resignation. Otherwise, it would be unreasonable for the unit to take responsibility for them for a longer period of time. As for employees with more than three years of continuous working years who have stopped working for a long time due to illness or non-work-related injuries, they will still be treated according to sick leave benefits, and will not be handled for resignation unless they voluntarily resign according to the provisions of Article 2 (2) of these regulations. Because these employees have worked for a longer period of time and contributed more to production or work, the treatment they receive should be different from that of employees who have worked for a short period of time and have not contributed much. In order to differentiate the treatment, there must be a boundary. So why should the boundary for distinguishing these two situations be exactly three years of continuous working years? Can it be stipulated as two years or four years? We believe that employees who have stopped working for a long time due to illness or injury for less than two years of continuous working years have only worked for a little more than a year in reality. It is obviously inappropriate to have the public support them for a long time after working for more than a year. If it is stipulated that four or five years of continuous working years be the boundary, then not only will these employees already be considered to have worked for a longer period of time and contributed more, but it will also cause the scope of resignation to be too wide, which is also inappropriate. Therefore, it is still more appropriate to stipulate three years of continuous working years as the boundary. If it is found in future implementation that this provision is not entirely appropriate, necessary revisions can be considered.

Another situation is that newly hired employees, due to lax physical examinations at the time of employment, are found to have serious chronic diseases that prevent them from persisting in their work within the initial period of employment (within six months), should also be handled for resignation. It would be inappropriate for both the public and private sectors to force these employees to stay in enterprises and agencies.

Regarding the treatment of employees at the time of resignation, this regulation, in the spirit of taking care of resigned personnel as much as possible, and based on the actual situation of China's large population, poor foundation, and relatively low level of production, has made appropriate provisions for resignation subsidies. In addition to paying resignation subsidies according to the length of service of the resigned personnel, special care is also given to the elderly, infirm, and long-term ill. The maximum amount of resignation subsidy is thirty months of the individual's salary. The reason for stipulating thirty months here is that resigned personnel who can receive this amount must have twenty-three years of continuous working years, while according to retirement regulations, those who have generally worked for twenty-five years and are physically weak and have lost their ability to work can retire and will not be handled for resignation. Therefore, the resignation subsidy should have such a maximum limit. According to the stipulated standards, according to the calculations of some enterprises and agencies, resigned personnel (except for those with particularly short working years) can generally receive several hundred yuan to one or two thousand yuan of resignation subsidy, which is enough to maintain their lives for several years to more than ten years. Such treatment standards can be said to be quite high according to China's current economic conditions. However, because the family circumstances of resigned personnel are very different, if some personnel encounter difficulties in their family life after resignation, the local government can appropriately resolve them according to social relief methods. In addition, when some resigned personnel re-qualify for employment and request work in the future, the local government can also appropriately handle them according to general social employment issues.

The issue of resignation is a relatively complex issue. Handling some employees for resignation is to take care of the overall interests of the country and the individual interests of the employees, which is in line with the policy of overall consideration and appropriate arrangements starting from 600 million people. However, to do this work well, it not only requires correct methods, but also must be properly grasped in practical work. When this regulation is implemented, all units should adopt a responsible attitude to ensure fairness and reasonableness, and ensure that the results of the implementation are truly conducive to the country's construction cause and the proper arrangement of resigned personnel.

Please review whether the above explanation is appropriate. Because some employees need to retire or resign in the current rectification and streamlining, the State Council's provisional regulations on handling the retirement of workers and staff have been promulgated and implemented, and this provisional resignation regulation also needs to be promulgated as soon as possible, in order to facilitate better work in this regard. For this reason, please approve this draft by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and after approval, the State Council will temporarily promulgate it as a draft for trial implementation, while mobilizing employees to discuss it, widely solicit opinions, and then make necessary revisions based on the opinions of the broad masses of employees before formally promulgating it for implementation.

### 关于“国务院关于工人、职员退职处理的暂行规定（草案）”的说明

    关于“国务院关于工人、职员退职处理的暂行规定（草案）”的说明
    中华人民共和国劳动部部长　马文瑞
    关于工人、职员的退职问题，国务院1955年年底发布的“国家机关工作人员退职处理暂行办法”和前政务院财政经济委员会1952年年初发布试行的“国营企业工人、职员退职处理暂行办法（草案）”，都作了规定。但是由于这两个办法都未公开发布，没有为广大职工所了解；过去一个时期中各单位对这项工作也不够重视，没有认真执行；加之原办法的某些规定不尽恰当，例如“国营企业工人、职员退职处理暂行办法（草案）”中所规定的退职条件限制过严（只限于身体衰弱不能工作，又不合于退休条件，自请退职的职工），而退职的待遇标准又偏低（退职补助费最高不得超过十二个月的本人工资总额），以致不少应该退职的职工，不能够或者不愿意退职。某些已经退职的职工，处理的办法和待遇也不相同，有的根据前述两个办法处理，有的自行拟定办法经上级主管部门或者地方劳动部门同意后进行处理，职工对此有些意见。因此，目前很需要重新制定一个更加切合实际的、企业和机关统一执行的退职办法，适当地规定职工退职的条件和待遇标准，以利妥善地处理工人、职员的退职问题，使退职人员能够得到适当的安排和照顾，同时也能够达到改进劳动组织，提高生产和工作效率的目的。
    按照新制订的这个规定，需要作退职处理的是属于如下几种情况的职工：
    一种情况是年老体衰，经劳动鉴定委员会或者医师证明不能继续从事原来的工作，在本企业、机关确实无轻便工作可分配，又不合退休条件的。这类职工一般是工龄短、条件不够享受退休待遇的。但是这些职工实际上已经不能继续从事工作，如果仍然留在生产或工作岗位上，不但对于精简和健全机构、提高生产、工作效率不利，对他们本人的身体也很不相宜。如果实事求是按照退职处理，发给一定数量的退职补助费，让他们退职后安心休息或者从事一些副业生产、家务辅助劳动，对于国家和他们本人，都是更为妥当的。
    另一种情况是本人自愿退职，而其退职对于本单位的生产或工作并无妨碍的。这类职工的自愿退职，或者因为本人的条件不适宜于现任工作，或者愿意从其他方面另谋工作（例如回乡从事农业生产），或者因为家庭需要愿意回家从事家务劳动，只要生产或者工作上离得开，就可以退职。但是，个别生产或工作上离不开的职工，如果不顾整体利益，为了个人目的而强求离职的话，应该以辞职或者自动离职论，不能按照退职处理，不得享受本规定的待遇。为了巩固劳动纪律，这样一种限制是必要的。
    再一种情况是担任工作时间不久（连续工龄不满三年），因病或者非因工负伤长期（一年以上）停止工作的。这类职工对生产或工作的贡献还不多，但是给所在单位的负担却很重，在本单位已经负责治疗一年多而仍然不能恢复健康参加工作的时候，是应该按照退职处理的。否则，要所在单位更长期地包
  下来，那是不合理的。至于连续工龄超过三年的职工因病或者非因工负伤长期停止工作的时候，仍然按照病伤假待遇，除了本人根据本规定第二条（二）项的规定自愿退职的以外，不作退职处理。因为这类职工工作已经较久，对生产或者工作的贡献较多，给予他们的待遇，理应与担任工作不久、贡献还不多的职工有所区别。为了要区别待遇，就不能不有个界限。那末为什么要把区别这两种情况的界限恰恰规定为连续工龄三年呢？可不可以规定为二年或者四年呢？我们考虑到，连续工龄不满二年的因病伤长期停止工作的职工，其实际工作时间只有一年多，工作一年多就要公家长期养起来，显然是不妥当的。如果规定以连续工龄四年或者五年为界限，那末，不仅因为这部分职工已经可以算做工作时间较久、贡献较多的，并且，那样还会造成退职的面过宽，也是不妥当的。因此，还以规定连续工龄三年为界限较宜。日后执行中如果发现这样规定不尽恰当，可以再考虑作必要的修改。
    还有一种情况是新参加工作的职工，由于录用的时候体格检查不严，在到职初期（六个月以内）发现原来患有严重慢性疾病，不能坚持工作的，也应该按照退职处理。如果把这类职工勉强留在企业、机关里，于公于私都是不适当的。
    关于职工退职时候的待遇问题，这个规定中本着尽可能地照顾退职人员的精神，根据我国人口多、底子穷、生产水平还相当低的实际情况，对于退职补助费作了适当的规定，除了按照退职人员的工龄长短发给退职补助费而外，对于年老体衰和长期患病的人员，还另有照顾。退职补助费的最高额为三十个月的本人工资。这里所以要规定为三十个月，是因为能够领取这个数目的退职人员，须有二十三年连续工龄，而按照退休规定，一般工龄满二十五年、身体衰弱丧失劳动能力的，就可以退休，不按退职处理。因此，退职补助费就应该有这样一个最高限额。按照规定的标准，据有些企业、机关的测算，退职人员（除了工龄特别短的以外）一般的可以领到几百元以至一、二千元的退职补助费，足够维持本人几年以至十年以上的生活。这样的待遇标准，按照我国当前的经济条件，可以说已经相当高了。但是，因为退职人员的家庭情况很不相同，有些人员如果在退职后家庭生活发生困难，可以由当地政府按照社会救济办法适当解决。另外，有些退职人员日后重新具备就业条件要求工作的时候，也可以由当地政府按照一般社会就业问题适当处理。
    退职问题是一个比较复杂的问题。对于某些职工按照退职处理，是照顾了国家整体利益和职工个人利益的，是符合从六亿人口出发统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针的。但是，要做好这件工作，不仅需要有正确的办法，还必须在实际工作中掌握得当。这个规定实施的时候，各单位都应该以认真负责的态度，做到公平合理，务使执行的结果真正有利于国家的建设事业和妥善地安排退职人员。
    以上说明是否妥当，请审议。由于在目前整风精简中有一些职工需要退休或者退职，现在国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定已经发布施行，这个退职暂行规定也需要早日发布，以利更妥善地进行这方面的工作。为此，请全国人民代表大会常务委员会对这个草案能予批准，在批准后由国务院暂以草案发布试行，同时发动职工讨论，广泛征求意见，然后再根据广大职工群众的意见作必要的修改后正式发布施行。　1958年3月7日
