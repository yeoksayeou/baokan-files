What to do about labor shortages?
展潮

What to do about labor shortages? This is a pressing question raised in the current great leap forward in agricultural production. The reason this question has become so pressing is that farmers are no longer producing in the old way, but are striving for continuous leaps forward, demanding substantial and multiplied increases in production. To this end, farmers need to undertake many projects such as building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer accumulation, improving soil, transforming terrain, refining cultivation, and increasing the area of multiple cropping. As a result, what was originally a surplus of labor is now insufficient.

There are two completely different ways to solve this problem: one is to passively retreat, reduce tasks, and slow down the pace of progress; the other is to do everything possible to tap labor potential, be proactive, and overcome difficulties.

Can difficulties be overcome? The approach of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Qin County, Shanxi Province, is an enlightening example. This cooperative has few households and a small population. The main difficulty they encountered in striving for a great leap forward in production with a target of 400 jin per mu was the lack of labor. According to the 1958 plan for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, they were short a full 6,500 workdays. Initially, the cooperative cadres attempted to abandon some cultivated land and reduce this year's afforestation and soil and water conservation targets. Later, with the help of the county party committee, the cadres and party members overcame their conservative thinking and adopted methods of extensive airing of views, free airing of views, and great debates to mobilize the cooperative members to find solutions. As a result, they found eleven simple but effective methods such as "building cave dwellings on the spot, keeping cattle and sheep out of the village" and "moving households to the mountains, farming distant land nearby." The problem was solved, and they even had a surplus of more than 6,700 workdays. Now the entire cooperative is full of enthusiasm for preparing for spring plowing.

The facts of the Xianfeng Cooperative show that during the great leap forward in production, especially in the current tense and busy season of both farmland water conservancy construction and spring plowing, the lack of rural labor is a very prominent difficulty, but it is not an insurmountable one. The key to the problem is to overcome conservative thinking and rely on the masses. Only by overcoming conservative thinking and blocking the retreat will people find a way out from a proactive perspective. Only by relying on the masses can people find effective ways to overcome various difficulties (including labor shortages), because the masses are in production practice, they understand the actual situation best, and they also have the most practical experience. The decisive issue here is the thought and working method of the mass line. Because only by relying on the masses and finding ways to overcome difficulties can people see the possibility of a leap forward and truly overcome conservative thinking.

The example of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative is just one of the cases in various regions of overcoming labor shortages. Various new tools and agricultural machinery to improve labor efficiency are rapidly emerging from farmers and workers in various regions. Various organizational measures to save labor, such as changing unreasonable methods of using labor, are also constantly being created. It should be believed that since a new task (rapidly developing agriculture) has been put on the agenda by the broad masses, the possibility of realizing this task has also appeared at the same time. Here, on the one hand, are such and such difficulties, and on the other hand, are such and such methods of overcoming difficulties. Leaders must anticipate difficulties and make ideological preparations early, and not be careless, lest they make mistakes. At the same time, they must also see the possibility of solving difficulties and not be pessimistic and negative. They should go deep among the masses, actively organize the masses to discuss and study, and find solutions. As long as they are good at inspiring and concentrating the wisdom of the masses, they will surely be able to break through all difficulties and always walk at the forefront of the times.

    劳力不足怎么办？
    展潮
    劳力不足怎么办？这是当前农村生产大跃进中所提出的一个尖锐的问题。这个问题所以尖锐起来，是因为农民现在已经不是在按照老样子生产，而是要生产不断地跃进，要求大幅度地成倍地增产。为此，农民要用许多工兴修水利，增积肥料，改良土壤，改造地势，加工耕作，增加复种面积，等等。这样，原来劳力有余的现在也不足了。
    解决这个问题可以有两种完全不同的方法：一种是消极退缩，减少任务，减缓前进速度；另一种是千方百计地发掘劳动潜力、积极进取，克服困难。
    困难是不是能够克服呢？关于这个问题，山西沁县先锋农业社的做法是一个富有启发性的例子。这个社户少人少，在争取亩产四百斤的生产大跃进中所遇到的主要困难是缺少劳动力。按照1958年农、林、牧、副业规划计算，他们整整差六千五百个工。社干部们最初曾经企图荒废一部分耕地，降低今年绿化和水土保持计划指标；后来经过县委帮助，干部、党员克服了保守思想，采取大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法，发动社员群众想办法，结果找到了“就地打窑洞、牛羊不进村”、“迁户上山、远地近种”等十一项简易而有效的办法，问题解决了，还长余出六千七百多个工。现在全社正劲头十足地闹备耕。
    先锋社的事实说明，在生产大跃进中、特别是在目前农田水利基本建设和春耕并举的紧张繁忙的季节里，农村劳动力缺乏是一个很突出的困难，但并不是不可以解决的困难。问题的关键，一个是克服保守思想，一个是依靠群众。必须克服了保守思想，堵死了退路，人们才会从积极方面找出路。必须依靠群众，人们才能够找到克服各种困难（包括劳力不足）的有效办法，因为群众在生产实践中，他们最了解实际情况，也最有实际经验。这里具有决定意义的问题，是群众路线的思想和工作方法。因为只有依靠群众，找出了克服困难的办法，人们才能够看到跃进的可能，才能真正克服保守思想。
    先锋农业社的例子，只是各地克服劳力不足的事例之一。各种各样提高劳动效率的新工具，农业机械，正在从各地农民和工人中迅速涌现出来。各种各样节省劳动力的组织措施，比如改变不合理的使用劳力办法等，也在不断地创造出来。应当相信，一个新的任务（迅速发展农业）既已被广大群众提到生活日程上来，那么实现这一任务的可能性就也同时出现了。在这里，一方面是这样那样的一些困难，一方面是这样那样的克服困难的办法。领导者一方面要预见到困难，早作思想准备，不可漫不经心，以致误事；一方面也要看到解决困难的可能，不要悲观消极。他们应当深入到群众中去，积极地组织群众讨论研究，想办法。只要他们善于启发和集中群众的智慧，他们就一定能够冲破一切困难，永远走在时代的最前面。
