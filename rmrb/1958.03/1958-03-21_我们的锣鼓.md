    Our Gongs and Drums
    Huang Gang
    "Why is the film industry so silent?"
    "Could it be that there are no more problems in the film industry?"
    —These are the two questions raised at the beginning of rightist "film critic" Zhong Dianfei's anti-Party polemic "The Gongs and Drums of Cinema." Only a year and three months have passed, and if anyone who has seen this year's new film exhibition were to look back at "The Gongs and Drums of Cinema," they would find that history's ridicule of those who doubt the progress of socialist construction is so merciless.
    Around the time "The Gongs and Drums of Cinema" was published, rightists spared no effort in attacking the film industry's adherence to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. They stirred up trouble, substituting falsehood for truth and exaggerating local shortcomings into a whole. They claimed that films reflecting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers were "so bleak in terms of audience turnout," that in recent years they had been "making films behind closed doors," and groundlessly accused Chinese cinema of not respecting its traditions, exaggerating that actors were "wasting their youth for nothing." All these accusations were heaped upon the socialist system and the Party's leadership of the film industry. Zhong Dianfei even proclaimed: "Therefore, we very much hope that this discussion can continue to deepen, truly opening up a new situation for China's film industry." Indeed, these challenges from the rightists received due response. China's film industry did indeed open up a completely new situation. However, all of this was primarily due to overcoming the influence of revisionist thought in literary and artistic circles and the film industry: the train of history is moving in the direction opposed by the rightists, and the speed of this advancement is beyond what ordinary people can estimate according to convention.
    The drums of the great leap forward in our film industry have been beating so loudly: fallacies and heresies have been defeated; production targets have been greatly increased; if our artistic film output this year reaches only eighty films, it will leave behind the crisis-ridden French film industry's annual output (seventy films); if our annual artistic film output soon increases to around one hundred films, then in terms of quantity, it will exceed the British film industry, which has been hovering around an annual output of sixty to ninety films in recent years; as for domestic audience attendance, this year we will exceed the United States' domestic audience attendance (around 2.4 billion). What is mentioned here is just a numerical indicator. The quality and value of literary and artistic works cannot be compared with numbers; therefore, what gives us even more confidence is that China's outstanding film artists are demanding to further master the principles of socialist realism in revolutionary practice, and the unified arrangement of going deep into the masses and comprehensive training has become the fundamental guarantee for artists to transform their thinking and improve the level of their works. And from some of the good films in this new film exhibition, whether in the improvement of ideological and artistic qualities or the diversification of styles, we can hear the footsteps of Chinese filmmakers moving forward.
    Now, who can still say in a slanderous tone: is the film front so silent? Who can still say: haven't the fine traditions of Chinese progressive cinema been further developed? Who can still say that film work is not receiving broad support from the masses and literary and artistic circles in our country? Who still has reason to believe in such a distorted view: that the problems in China's socialist film industry are filled with insurmountable danger, while the operation of the capitalist film industry is in every way worthy of nostalgia?
    The rightists used anti-Party gongs and drums as their program and a signal to gather their strength, while the leftists and the broad ranks of workers in the film industry use our all-round great leap forward gongs and drums of anti-waste, anti-conservatism, and competition for advancement as our program and bugle call for marching towards socialism. This is truly a clear battle formation, representing the will of the masses and reflecting the laws of history: the gongs and drums against socialism ultimately end in promoting people's enthusiasm for defending and building socialism. This great leap forward situation gives our gongs and drums a powerful force, making this gongs and drums a magnificent symphony of marching towards socialism.

    我们的锣鼓
    黄钢
    “为什么电影这样沉寂？”
    “难道电影已经没有问题了？”
    ——这是右派“影评人”锺惦棐在他的反党檄文“电影的锣鼓”中劈头所提的两个问题。时间只不过相隔了一年零三个月，如果有谁在看了今年的开始的新片展览以后，再把那篇“电影的锣鼓”翻一翻，就会发现，对于那些怀疑社会主义建设进程的人们，历史对他的嘲笑是这样的无情。
    还在“电影的锣鼓”发表的前后，右派分子们对于坚持为工农兵服务的电影事业攻击得不遗余力，他们兴风作浪，以虚代实，以假渗真，把局部的缺点夸大成为整体，说什么反映工农兵生活的电影“观众却如此不景气”，说什么这些年来是“关起门来搞电影”，以及凭空地指责说中国电影的传统没有得到尊重，夸大其词地说演员“白白地浪费掉自己的青春”，这等等罪名都一古脑儿加在社会主义体制与党对电影事业的领导上面，锺惦棐还由此扬言道：“因之我们很希望这讨论还能继续深入下去，真正为我国电影事业打开一个新的局面。”确实，右派分子的这些挑战都得到了应有的回答。我国电影事业确也因此而打开了一个全新的局面。只是这一切首先是由于战胜了文学艺术界与电影界修正主义思潮的影响而得来的：历史列车是朝着右派分子所反对的方向前进，而这前进的超速度却又不是一般人们按照常规所能估计的。
    我们电影事业跃进的战鼓已经敲击得如此的响亮：谬论邪说已被打倒；生产指标已经大大上升；如果说我们今年艺术片产量仅达到八十部，那就会把呈现出危机的法国电影年产数字（七十部）甩在后边；如果说不久以后我们艺术片年产量增长到一百部左右，那么，从数量上也就会超过近几年来摇摆在年产量六十部——九十部左右的英国电影了；至于在国内观众人次方面，我们今年将可超过美国国内的观众人次（二十四亿左右）。这里所说的不过是一个数字的指标。文学艺术工作的优劣与价值，有些是不能用数字来比的；因此，更令我们信心倍增的是：我国优秀的电影艺术家，已经在革命实践中要求进一步掌握社会主义现实主义的原则，而深入群众，全面锻炼的统一安排，则成了艺术家改造自己思想与提高作品水平的根本保证。而从这次新片展览中的一些好的影片中，无论在思想性和艺术性的提高或风格的多样化这些方面，都能听到我国电影工作者向前迈进的脚步声。
    现在，谁还能用诬蔑性的口吻说：电影战线是这样的沉寂呢？谁还能够说：中国进步电影的优良传统没有得到进一步的发扬？谁还能说电影工作不是受到我国群众与文学艺术界广泛的支援？谁还有理由会去相信这样一种歪曲的看法：我国社会主义电影事业中的问题惶惶不可终日，而资本主义电影事业经营是百般地值得留恋呢？
    右派分子以反党的锣鼓作为他们的纲领与集合他们力量的信号，左派分子与电影界的广泛从业员则以我们这一场反浪费反保守比先进的全面大跃进的锣鼓，来作为我们向社会主义进军的纲领与号角。这真是阵势分明，代表着群众的意志，反映出历史的规律：反对社会主义的锣鼓最终是以促进了人们对于捍卫与建设社会主义的热情而告终。这个大跃进的形势，使我们的锣鼓具有了强大的威力，使这场锣鼓形成了向社会主义行进的壮丽交响乐。
