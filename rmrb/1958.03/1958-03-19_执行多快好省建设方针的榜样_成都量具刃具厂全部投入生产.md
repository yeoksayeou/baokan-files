Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 18th. The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, China's largest modern precision machine tool manufacturing factory, has been completed and recently put into full operation.

　　Throughout the construction process, this plant consistently adhered to the principle of building the factory diligently and thriftily, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. It was built according to the design blueprints of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. However, when reusing the original design, modifications were made to the projects and standards of several engineering aspects based on the need to bring investment benefits into play as early as possible and on varying local conditions. Therefore, compared with the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, the construction investment of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant was only three-fifths of that of the Harbin plant. From the preparation for construction to completion, the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant took more than two years less than the Harbin plant. At the same time, because the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant reduced non-productive and auxiliary construction projects and concentrated funds on building the main factory buildings, purchasing machinery and equipment, and improving process regulations, its designed production efficiency is about half greater than that of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant.

　　The completion of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant will play a significant role in promoting the further development of China's machinery industry. The various precision measuring tools and cutting tools it produces are indispensable to the machinery industry. The higher the precision of the products manufactured by the machinery industry, the more complete precision measuring tools and cutting tools are needed; otherwise, product quality cannot be guaranteed. The cutting tools produced by this plant alone include forty-nine categories and two thousand and eighty-six specifications. The error in the length and parallelism of certain measuring tools, such as gauge blocks, does not exceed seven hundred-thousandths of a millimeter, which is only one-thousandth of the thickness of newspaper paper.

　　Since the plant began preparations for construction in February 1956 and started construction in May, it has adopted the method of simultaneous construction and production, with phased and batch-by-batch commissioning. In 1957, it produced three hundred and forty different specifications of measuring tools and cutting tools for the country. This year, based on the needs of industrial production, while continuing to master new production technologies, it will produce more than 3.7 million pieces of measuring tools and cutting tools, increasing the product specifications to seven hundred and twenty.

### 执行多快好省建设方针的榜样  成都量具刃具厂全部投入生产

    执行多快好省建设方针的榜样
    成都量具刃具厂全部投入生产
    新华社成都18日电　我国最大的现代化精密机械工具制造工厂——成都量具刃具厂已经建成，最近全部投入生产。
    这个厂在建设过程中，一贯坚持了多、快、好、省的勤俭建厂方针。它是按照哈尔滨量具刃具厂的设计图纸建设的；但是在重复使用原设计时，对若干工程的项目和标准，都根据早日发挥投资效果和地区的不同条件进行了修改。因此，两厂相比，成都量具刃具厂的建设投资只有哈尔滨量具刃具厂的五分之三；从筹备建厂到建成的时间，成都量具刃具厂比哈尔滨量具刃具厂缩短了两年多。同时，由于成都量具刃具厂削减了非生产性和辅助性的建筑工程，把资金集中用到修建主厂房、购买机器设备、改进工艺规程等方面，它的设计生产效能比哈尔滨量具刃具厂约增大一半。
    成都量具刃具厂的建成，对促进我国机械工业进一步发展将起很大作用。它生产的各种精密量具和刃具，都是机械工业所不可缺少的。机械工业制造的产品的精密度越高，就越需要有完整的精密量具和刃具；不然，产品质量便没有保证。仅这个厂生产的刃具就有四十九类、二千零八十六种规格；某些量具如块规的长度和平行度的误差，不超过十万分之七公厘，只有报纸纸张厚度的千分之一。
    这个厂从1956年2月筹建、5月动工兴建以来，采取了边建设、边生产、分期分批投入生产的措施，在1957年的一年里，已为国家生产了三百四十种不同规格的量具和刃具。今年根据工业生产的需要，将在继续掌握新生产新技术的同时，生产三百七十多万件量具和刃具，产品规格增加到七百二十种。
