　　Distant Congratulations on Three Happy Events
　　Cao Di

　　Good news came from Moscow: Chen Jingkai and Huang Qianghui won the championships in the bantamweight and lightweight categories respectively in the Moscow International Individual Weightlifting Competition, and Zhao Qingkui won the runner-up in the light heavyweight category.

　　Although only nine countries participated in this individual weightlifting competition, almost all of the top three from the 1957 World Weightlifting Championships participated. Therefore, this competition can be said to be a battle for the world weightlifting crown. This is the first time that our athletes have participated in such an individual international weightlifting competition, but in this participation, they have won honor for the motherland. Huang Qianghui's total score reached 382.5 kilograms, only 2.5 kilograms short of the world record. We hereby extend our distant congratulations to them on these three happy events.

　　Our country's weightlifting sport is a very young project, but in the past two or three years, there has been a great leap forward. We have increased the pre-liberation weightlifting record by a total of 1,138.5 kilograms, we already have one world record, and our weightlifting level has leaped to third place in the world. However, the achievements we have already obtained are not enough. Of the current twenty-eight weightlifting world records, the Soviet Union accounts for seventeen, the United States accounts for ten, and our country only accounts for one (and that is a single event). Therefore, we still need to work harder to create better results and create higher records.

    遥贺三喜

    莫斯科传来喜讯：陈镜开和黄强辉在莫斯科奖个人国际举重比赛中分别获得了最轻量级和轻量级冠军，赵庆奎获得轻重量级亚军。
    这次个人举重比赛，虽然只有九个国家参加，但是1957年世界举重冠军赛的前三名几乎都参加了。因此这次比赛可以说是世界举重桂冠的争夺战。我国运动员参加这样的个人国际举重比赛还是第一次，可是他们就在这一次参加比赛中为祖国争得了荣誉。黄强辉的总成绩，达到了三百八十二点五公斤，同世界纪录只差二点五公斤。我们在这里向他们遥贺三喜。
    我国举重运动是一个很年轻的项目，但是，最近两三年来有了很大的跃进。我们已把解放前的举重纪录总共提高了一千一百三十八点五公斤，我们已有一个世界纪录，我们的举重水平已跃为世界第三位。但是，我们已获得的成就是不够的。目前二十八个举重世界纪录中，苏联占了十七个，美国占了十个，我国只占一个（而且是单项）。因此，我们还需要加倍努力，创造更好的成绩，创造更高的纪录。
