    The Great Leap Forward Shatters Old Superstitions
    In Ganhaizi Township, Guangtong County, Yunnan Province, there is an old story. Legend has it that during the reign of Emperor Yongzheng in the Qing Dynasty, Ganhaizi Township produced two of the most capable people. One was Pu Moduo from Puja Village, the bravest in battle, capable of withstanding seventy people alone. The other was Guo Laobei from Guojia Village, who could do the work of one hundred and twenty people by himself. After plowing the fields, he would hug the water buffalo and take it to the pond for a bath, and after washing it, he would hug it back to the shore. The prefectural official of Chuxiong Prefecture, fearing that they would cause trouble, wanted to cut off the "dragon vein" of these families and kill them. Under the pretext of digging a canal, they opened up the mountain cave of Ganhaizi. Legend has it that after the ditch was opened, several capable people died one after another. Later generations blocked the cave. Since then, no one dared to mention drilling the mountain cave. The legend that "digging through the mountain cave would kill people" has been circulating ever since.
    But this year is very different. After the great airing of views and debates, everyone's awareness has been raised. They know that to achieve a great leap forward in production, they must drill through mountain caves and divert water to irrigate the fields. During the mountain cave drilling project, everyone was very enthusiastic, changing from a two-shift system to a three-shift system, with each shift digging three *zhang* (approximately 10 meters) , digging nine *zhang* in one day and one night. Now, the three-kilometer-long water diversion canal has been dug through, and Ganhaizi, known for being "dry," is about to become a "water sea."

    大跃进打破了老迷信
    云南省广通县干海子乡流传着一个古老的故事。相传在前清雍正年间，干海子乡出了两个最有本事的人。一个是普家村的普磨夺，打仗最勇敢，一个人能抵七十多人。一个是郭家村的郭老倍，一个人能干一百二十人的活计。他犁完田，就把大水牛抱到塘里洗澡，洗完了又抱上岸来。楚雄府的府官怕他们闹事，想挖断了这几家人的“龙脉”，把他们害死，就借挖渠为名，打通了干海子的山洞。传说沟子打通以后，几个有本事的人就先后死光了。后辈们就把这个洞子堵起来。从此，一个也不敢提钻山洞的事。“挖通钻山洞就要死人”的传说，一直流传下来。
    可是今年大不同了。经过大鸣大放，大家觉悟提高了，知道要生产大跃进，只有打通钻山洞，引水灌田。在钻山洞工程中，大家热情很高，由两班制改为三班制，每班挖进三丈，一日一夜挖进九丈。现在，长达三公里的引水沟，已经挖通，以“干”出名的干海子就要变成“水海子”了。
