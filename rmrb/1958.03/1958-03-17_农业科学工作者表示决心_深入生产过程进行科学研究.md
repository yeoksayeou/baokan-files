Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: Fifty-nine senior scientific workers of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences held a meeting this afternoon and unanimously passed a letter of determination, expressing their willingness to contribute to the great leap forward in socialist agricultural production.

In their letter of determination, they stated: We must dedicate our hearts to the Party, accelerate the completion of our ideological self-remolding, go deep into the agricultural production process for research, impart scientific knowledge to the peasants, and quickly promote advanced experiences and research results into production. They also proposed that all agricultural scientific workers in the country should be leftists in politics and ideology, promoters in agricultural scientific work, and become agricultural scientific workers who are both red and expert, deeply red and proficient in their specialties, within three years.

During the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement at the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, many senior scientific staff members examined their scientific research work and realized that the bourgeois pursuit of personal fame and gain was the ideological source of waste and conservatism in their work. This led to prolonged detachment from production and the masses, failure to devote their main energy to serving current production, and hindering the development of agricultural science. Through this rectification movement, they realized the importance of eliminating bourgeois ideology on the scientific front.

    农业科学工作者表示决心
    深入生产过程进行科学研究
    新华社15日讯　中国农业科学院五十九位高级科学工作者今天下午开会，一致通过了决心书，表示要为社会主义农业生产大跃进贡献出一份力量。
    他们在决心书上表示：要把心交给党，加速完成自我思想改造，深入农业生产过程进行研究，把科学知识交给农民，迅速地把先进经验和研究成果推广到生产中去。他们还倡议和全国农业科学工作者一道，要在政治上、思想上做左派，在农业科学工作上做促进派，三年内成为又红又专、红透专深的农业科学工作者。
    农业科学院在反浪费反保守运动中，不少高级科学工作人员检查了他们的科学研究工作，认识到资产阶级追求个人名利是造成工作中浪费与保守的思想根源，以致长期脱离生产、脱离群众，没有用主要精力为当前生产服务，阻碍了农业科学事业的发展。通过这次整风运动，他们认识到在科学战线上消灭资产阶级思想的重要意义。
