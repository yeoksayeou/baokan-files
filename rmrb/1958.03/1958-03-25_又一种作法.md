    Another Approach
    Several experiences have already been gained in applying the method of cultivating experimental plots to leadership work in industrial production; in rural work, there are also different methods of cultivating experimental plots. A few days ago, this newspaper published a report about the Xiaogan County Party Committee in Hubei Province planning to develop 200,000 mu of contiguous experimental fields this year, changing small-scale experiments into large-scale experiments. Today, everyone can also read the news about the Gannan District Party Committee establishing a comprehensive experimental farm. These regions, following the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions on cultivating experimental plots and based on local conditions, have adopted different forms of cultivating experimental plots, enabling many leading cadres to truly abandon bureaucratic styles, step out of their offices, become familiar with production, connect with the masses, and better lead production. This is a serious attitude, and their methods can also serve as a reference.

    又一种作法
    种试验田的方法在工业生产领导工作中，已经有了好几种经验；在农村工作中，种试验田也有不同的方法。几天以前，本报发表了湖北孝感县委计划在今年搞二十万亩连成一片的试验畈，把小块试验改变为大面积试验的报道；今天，大家又读到赣南区党委举办综合性试验农场的消息。这些地区遵照党中央种试验田指示的精神，依据当地的条件，采取不同的形式种试验田，使许多领导干部能因此真正打掉官风，走出办公室，熟悉生产，联系群众，更好地领导生产，这是一种认真的态度，而他们的办法也可作为参考。
