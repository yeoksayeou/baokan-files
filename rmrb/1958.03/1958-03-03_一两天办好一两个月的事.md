    In the past, users applying for electricity service from the Shanghai Electricity Department had to visit the business office, the line management office, and the power transmission and transformation engineering company, covering two or thirty departments. This process often dragged on for one or two months. Now, the electricity department has decided to centralize the departments responsible for user connections from these three units into one office, gradually simplifying the procedures for user connection. Work that previously took one or two months to complete can now be done in one or two days.

    一两天办好一两个月的事
    过去，用户向上海电业部门从申请接电到用上电，必须跑遍电业部门的营业所、线路管理所、送变电工程公司等三个单位的二、三十个科室。往往一拖就是一两个月。现在，电业部门决定把三个单位中负责用户接电工作的科室集中在一起办公，逐步简化用户接电手续。过去要一两个月才能办好的工作，今后在一两天内就可以办成。
