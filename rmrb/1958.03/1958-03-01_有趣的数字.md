    Interesting Numbers
    How many red blood cells are in a person's body? There are at least five million red blood cells in a drop of blood the size of a needle's head. A person of medium build has 4,700 CCs of blood in their body, containing 25 trillion red blood cells. If they were laid flat, they could cover an area of 3,300 square yards, exceeding the total surface area of the human body by 1,500 times. The blood of all mankind is enough to cover the entire Earth.
