    Can Write or Not Write, Don't Write
    Ye Shengtao
    I think the formula "Can × or not ×, don't ×" is also useful for improving writing style. That is to say, whether it's a word, a sentence, or a long passage of hundreds or thousands of words, if it can be written, but not writing it doesn't harm the overall meaning of the piece, then resolutely cut it off and don't write it. When you do this, the article becomes clean and neat.

    If you don't adopt the "Can × or not ×, don't ×" formula and let things that can be written or not written run rampant, there is no end to it. Since you can accommodate this part that can be put in but doesn't play a role, why can't you accommodate that redundant part? The only result is to accommodate everything, writing in everything that comes to mind when you put pen to paper. In this way, you can certainly say there's a bottom line, but that "bottom line" is based on what you think of when you write, which is too broad.

    Think about what the impact is when you do this. For any part that doesn't play a role, since you've written it, the reader has to read it. They have to use their minds and spend time reading this part, and that mind and time are wasted. Furthermore, the things you write are spread in society, relying on the labor of printing workers and the paper produced by papermakers. If your things have parts that don't play a role, then their labor and products are also wasted. Just looking at these two wastes, shouldn't we be more careful when we write?

    Can write or not write, don't write—this is on the one hand. On the other hand, everything written must be something that absolutely must be written. Whether it's a word, a sentence, or a long passage of hundreds or thousands of words, if someone asks, you can give a reason for its existence. This is called "essential words are not verbose." I think "essential words are not verbose" is a good writing style.

    可写可不写，不写
    叶圣陶
    我想，“可×可不×，不×”的公式，对改进文风也有用处。就是说，凡是一个词，一句话，多到几百字几千字的一大段，写进去也可以，可是不写进去，对全篇意旨并无什么损害，那就坚决割舍，不写进去。这么办的时候，文章就干净利落。
    要是不采用“可×可不×，不×”的公式，让可写可不写的东西自由泛滥，那是没有底的。既然可以容纳这一个放得进去可是不起作用的部分，为什么不能容纳那一个叠床架屋的部分呢？结果惟有一律容纳，凡是下笔时候想到的一律写进去。这样，固然也可以说有底，但是那个“底”以下笔时候想到的为范围，未免太宽泛了。
    试想一想这么办的时候影响怎么样。凡是不起什么作用的部分，你既然写了，读者就得读下去，他们读这一部分要用心思，要花时间，那心思和时间是浪费的。再说，你写的东西在社会里传布，要靠印刷工人的劳动，要用造纸工人生产的纸张，你的东西有了不起什么作用的部分，也就是他们的劳动和产品有了浪费。只要看这两笔浪费账，咱们下笔时候不就该谨严点儿吗？
    可写可不写，不写，这是就一方面说。就另一方面说，就是所有写下来的，必须是非写不可的东西。无论一个词，一句话，多到几百字几千字的一大段，如果人家来问，都说得出个要它存在的理由。这样叫“要言不繁”。我想，“要言不繁”是好文风。
