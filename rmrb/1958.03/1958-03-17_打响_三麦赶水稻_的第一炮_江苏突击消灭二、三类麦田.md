Firing the First Shot of "Replacing Rice with Three Wheats"
Jiangsu Launches a Concentrated Effort to Eliminate Second and Third Class Wheat Fields
(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 14th dispatch) Under the slogan of "Getting Grain from the Land," the broad masses of rural people in Jiangsu Province are actively carrying out a concentrated month of cultivating three wheats (namely wheat, barley, and naked barley), determined to eliminate second and third class wheat fields before the Spring Equinox, and fire the first shot of "Replacing Rice with Three Wheats."

Since February, farmers throughout the province have launched a concentrated effort to cultivate three wheats. A large labor force is flowing incessantly in the wheat fields, applying fertilizer, ditching, and adding soil around the roots of the plants. People are carefully cultivating one process after another, and the wheat seedlings are growing strong. The proportion of first-class wheat fields in the province has greatly increased, and the proportion of third-class wheat fields has been reduced from the original 16% to about 7%. The people of Changshu County, with the revolutionary spirit of "One load of river mud, one pound of grain, turning fertilizer storage into grain storage," and "Sending off the sun and welcoming the moon, rushing through two days of farm work in one," have made the amount of three wheats processing equivalent to three times that of 1956, truly achieving full and uniform seedlings, abundant fertilization, deep ditching, and vigorous growth of three wheats, determined to catch up with rice this year and achieve a yield of 500 jin per mu. Fude Cooperative in Yangzhou County, through discussions with experienced farmers, Party Branch Secretary Qu Caiyun first followed the advice of the old farmers, transplanted the wheat from the moisture furrows to the wheat mounds where seedlings were missing, applied fertilizer five times, and weeded three times, quickly turning the 1.2 mu of second-class wheat experimental field into a thriving one, catching up with first-class wheat. After the cadres' experimental field set an example, the commune members immediately took action, quickly upgrading 200 mu of second and third class wheat (accounting for 40%) in the entire cooperative to first-class wheat, and making preparations to lower the water table and prevent and control pests and diseases. Representatives from various places who came to visit unanimously commented, "Every field is good wheat." At present, all parts of the province have made preparations for drought prevention, flood prevention, frost prevention, and pest and disease prevention, determined to overcome all natural disasters and eliminate second and third class wheat fields.

    打响“三麦赶水稻”的第一炮
    江苏突击消灭二、三类麦田
    本报南京14日电　江苏省广大农村群众在“向土地要粮食”的口号下，积极开展三麦（即大小麦和元麦）培植突击月，决心在春分前消灭二、三类麦田，打响“三麦赶水稻”的第一炮。
    自2月份以来，全省农民开展了三麦培植突击工作，麦田里追肥、开沟、培根壅土的劳动大军川流不息，人们一道工序紧接着一道工序的细心培植，麦苗长势健壮。全省一类麦田的比例大大增加，三类麦田的比例已经从原来16％降低到7％左右。常熟县人民以“一担河泥一斤粮，肥仓变粮仓”，“送走日头接月亮，两天农活一天抢”的革命干劲，使三麦加工量相当于1956年的三倍，真正做到苗全苗齐，施肥多，开沟深，三麦生长旺盛，决心今年赶上水稻，实现亩产五百斤。扬中县福德社通过老农座谈，党支部书记瞿采云首先按照老农献计，把墒沟里的麦移栽到缺苗的麦塿里，施肥五次，锄草三遍，使一亩二分二类麦试验田马上转旺，赶上一类麦。干部试验田做出样子之后，社员们立即行动起来了，使全社二百亩二、三类麦（占40％）很快上升为一类麦，而且做好降低地下水位和防治病虫害的准备工作。各地前来参观的代表一致评论“圩圩是好麦”。目前，全省各地都作好了防旱、防涝、防冻、防病虫害的准备工作，决心战胜一切自然灾害，消灭二、三类麦田。
