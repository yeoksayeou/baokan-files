    What is "Dian Jiang Chun"?
    Yesterday, the supplement published a ci poem: "Dian Jiang Chun." "Dian Jiang Chun" is the name of a *ci* tune. It takes its meaning from Jiang Yan's poem "Bright pearls dot crimson lips." Each poem is stipulated to have forty-one characters. According to "Ci Lu," it is "also known as Nanpu Yue, Shatou Yu, and Dian Yingtao," but it is not commonly seen. This tune is used most often in northern *qu* in *ci* and *qu*, mostly as the first piece in a suite of songs. In opera, it is often used as an introduction when a character enters the stage because its rhythm is slow, and it is also known as *huanban* (slow tempo). In Kunqu Opera, such as Lu Zhishen's "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate," this tune is used. In Peking Opera, some military generals (*hualian*, painted-face roles) cover their faces with their water sleeves when they appear, and some also sing a "Dian Jiang Chun" before reciting their entrance poem and announcing their name.

### 什么是“点绛唇”？

    什么是“点绛唇”？
    昨天副刊发表了一首词：“点绛唇”。“点绛唇”是词牌的名字”是取江淹诗“明珠点绛唇”的意思，每一首规定四十一个字，据“词律”说：“又名南浦月、沙头雨、点樱桃”，但是不常见。这个牌子，在词曲中，北曲用得最多、大半用在一套曲子中的第一首，在戏中往往作为人物上场后的引子，因为它的音节缓慢，又称为缓板。昆曲中如鲁智深“醉打山门”，即有这个牌子。在京戏中，有些武将（花脸）出场时，用水袖掩面，有的亦唱一个点绛唇，随后再念上场诗和报名。　（非）
