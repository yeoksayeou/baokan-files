    Strengthen Technical Guidance to Accelerate the Elimination of the Four Pests
    Xinhui Organizes a Technical Guidance Network for Eliminating the Four Pests

    This newspaper reports that a long-term, fixed technical guidance network for eliminating the four pests is being organized in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province.

    The technical guidance network for eliminating the four pests in Xinhui County will be spread throughout all villages and market towns in the county. It is centered on rat-killing experts, sparrow-killing experts, and sanitation workers who eliminate the four pests from among the masses. First, a technical guidance group for eliminating the four pests will be formed at the county level. The guidance group will then guide the technical work of eliminating the four pests throughout the county through mass-based technical personnel for eliminating the four pests in each township.

    The recent training courses held throughout the county have already cultivated a group of technical backbone forces for eliminating the four pests in each township. Li Yihuan, the representative of the four-person rat-killing team from the Lile Second Commune who caught more than 20,000 rats last year, Wu Dongfu, a rat-catching expert in his sixties, and Chen Guoqin and Tang Nan, who can catch 400 sparrows a day, and other experts in eliminating the four pests, all imparted their techniques and experiences to the cadres and students from various townships in the training class. This group of technical backbones for eliminating the four pests, after being trained, are now spreading the new technologies they have learned to the masses in various townships, and are organizing rat-killing, sparrow-killing, mosquito-killing, and fly-killing teams in their respective localities. Now, the county and all townships have established "Committees for Eliminating the Four Pests and Beautifying the Countryside" to comprehensively lead the technical and organizational work of eliminating the four pests.

    In 1956, Xinhui County had already organized a technical guidance group for eliminating the four pests to tour and provide technical instruction throughout the county. This technical guidance group was divided into groups to tour twelve districts, and in more than thirty teaching sessions and on-site demonstrations alone, it spread the technology of eliminating the four pests to more than 1,200 farmers. Activists for eliminating the four pests selected by various agricultural cooperatives learned various methods and experiences from the experts, such as the method of catching sparrows with nets, the method of trapping rats, the method of catching rats with bamboo bows, the method of spear-catching, and identifying rat holes and sparrow nests, and then spread them to the masses. The masses were very interested in the technical guidance for eliminating the four pests. Many people learned the techniques, and their enthusiasm for eliminating the four pests increased even more. In May of that year, in just over twenty days, the county eliminated more than 300,000 rats and more than 60,000 sparrows.

    加强技术指导　加速消灭四害
    新会组织除四害技术指导网
    本报讯　一个长期固定的除四害技术指导网，正在广东省新会县组织中。
    新会县的除四害技术指导网将遍布在全县各个乡村和圩镇。它是以来自群众中的灭鼠能手、灭雀能手和除四害卫生工作人员为核心，首先在县一级组成一个除四害技术指导团。指导团再通过各个乡镇中群众性的除四害技术人员，指导全县除四害的技术工作。
    全县最近举办的训练班，已经培养出一批各乡镇的除四害技术骨干力量。去年捕鼠两万多只的礼乐二社四人灭鼠小组的代表李奕欢、六十多岁的捕鼠能手吴栋福、一天能捕麻雀四百只的陈国勤和汤南等除四害能手，都在训练班向各乡的干部学员传授了自己的技术和经验。经过训练的这批除四害技术骨干，正在各乡镇再向群众传播他们所学到的新技术，并且在当地分别组织灭鼠、灭雀、灭蚊、灭蝇小组。现在，县和各乡都已成立了“消灭四害美化农村委员会”，全面领导除四害的技术和组织工作。
    新会县在1956年已组织过除四害技术指导团，到全县各地巡回传授和指导技术。这个技术指导团曾分组到十二个区去巡回，仅在三十多次传授会上和现场示范中就向一千二百多农民传播了除四害的技术。各个农业社选派出来的除四害积极分子，向能手们学到了网捕麻雀法、夹鼠法、竹弓捕鼠法、剡捕法和识别鼠洞、雀窝等多种多样的方法和经验，然后向群众传播。群众对除四害技术指导很感兴趣，许多人学会了技术，除四害劲头更大了。那年五月，二十多天内，全县就消灭了三十多万只老鼠和六万多只麻雀。
