Xinhua News Agency, London, March 17th: "The British people demand a swift end to the dangerous and insane arms race," this is the conclusion reached by the "Daily Herald" after conducting an opinion poll of over 13,000 readers.

The newspaper asked readers whether they believed that the possibility of international disarmament would increase if Britain: (1) did not test hydrogen bombs; (2) stopped producing hydrogen bombs; (3) did not allow the establishment of American rocket bases on its territory; (4) prohibited American bombers carrying hydrogen bombs from flying over its territory. The newspaper received approximately 13,000 affirmative responses to these questions; only a little over 200 negative responses were received.

Simultaneously, the British "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament" organization conducted an opinion poll of students at Oxford University. Of the university students who responded, 60% advocated that Britain should cease testing nuclear weapons and strive to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union. 55% of the university students believed that Britain's possession of hydrogen bombs did not increase its influence in international negotiations. The majority of students also believed that Britain should strive for nuclear disarmament and not link this issue to the issue of complete disarmament. Responses to other questions also revealed that the majority of British youth opposed the establishment of American rocket bases in Britain, opposed American planes carrying atomic bombs flying over Britain, and advocated that Britain should reject nuclear weapons.

    英国人民不要氢弹
    要求迅速停止危险的核军备竞赛
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社伦敦17日讯：“英国人民要求迅速停止危险的和疯狂的军备竞赛”，这是“每日先驱报”对一万三千多名读者进行一次民意测验以后作出的结论。
    这家报纸让读者谈一谈，他们是否认为国际裁军的可能性会增加，假如英国：（一）不试验氢弹；（二）停止生产氢弹；（三）不允许在自己境内设置美国火箭基地；（四）禁止载有氢弹的美国轰炸机在自己领土上空飞行。报纸收到了大约一万三千件对于这些问题的肯定的答复；否定的答复只有二百多件。
    同时，英国“争取核裁军运动”组织向牛津大学学生进行了民意测验。在提出答复的大学生中，有60％主张英国停止试验核武器，尽力和苏联达成协议。55％的大学生认为英国拥有氢弹并不能扩大它对国际谈判的影响。大多数学生还认为，英国应该争取核裁军，不要把这个问题和全面裁军问题联系在一起。从对其他一些问题的回答中还可以看出，英国大部分青年都反对美国在英国建立火箭基地，反对载有原子弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行，主张英国拒绝核武器。
