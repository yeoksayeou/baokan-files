The season for breeding draught animals has arrived.
	At present, the main power source for agricultural production in our country is draught animals. In the era of individual agricultural economy, draught animals were "half of the farmer's property." After collectivization, draught animals became "half of the collective's property." Every agricultural cooperative should actively establish this "half of the collective's property" while making a great leap forward in agricultural production.
	In recent years, some regions have not paid enough attention to the breeding of draught animals, resulting in a decline in the growth rate of draught animals. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, the number of draught animals decreased by more than 900,000 in 1957 compared to 1956. Due to the decrease in draught animals, some agricultural cooperatives had to replace animal power with human labor, which seriously affected the increase in crop production. The fundamental way to reverse this situation is to focus on breeding draught animals.
	Currently, the severe winter has passed in most parts of our country, and the earth is returning to spring. This is a good time to breed draught animals. Every agricultural cooperative should seize this favorable opportunity and do a good job in the mating of draught animals.
	Experience in many regions has proven that leadership attention is the key to doing this work well. Agricultural cooperatives and production teams should have dedicated personnel responsible for managing draught animal work and formulating and implementing breeding plans. Shuangxi Cooperative in Jingmen County, Hubei Province, adopted the methods mentioned above, and its more than 90 mother cows gave birth to a total of 201 calves in three years, with an average annual breeding rate of over 70%.
	Equipping a sufficient number of stud animals based on the number of breeding female animals in the cooperative is something that must be done now. If there are not enough stud animals, stud animals previously used for work can be restored for breeding purposes; townships and cooperatives can also adjust their use between each other. Agricultural cooperatives can also consult with nearby government agencies and military units for support in this regard.
	The season for breeding draught animals is also a busy time for agricultural work. Therefore, some cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives are afraid that pregnancy and calving of female animals will delay production and are unwilling to breed draught animals. This problem can be solved. Female animals can be reasonably allocated to various production teams, and sideline livestock can be used to adjust for livestock use during busy farming seasons; mating can also be carried out in batches according to agricultural activities. Each agricultural cooperative can refer to this method and make arrangements as soon as possible.

### 繁殖耕畜的季节到了

    繁殖耕畜的季节到了
    目前我国农业生产上的主要动力是耕畜。在个体农业经济时期，耕畜是农民的“半个家产”，合作化了，耕畜就成了“半个社产”了。每个农业社都应该在农业生产大跃进的同时，积极建立起这“半个社产”来。
    近年来有的地区对繁殖耕畜注意不够，因此耕畜增殖率下降。据山东、山西、安徽、江苏四省不完全统计，1957年比1956年减少九十多万头，由于耕畜减少，有些农业社只好用人力代替畜力，因而严重的影响了农作物的增产。扭转这种情况的根本办法就是：抓紧繁殖耕畜。
    目前我国大部地区严冬已过，大地回春，正是繁殖耕畜的好时期。每一个农业社都应该抓紧这个有利时机，做好耕畜配种工作。
    许多地区经验证明，领导重视是做好这一工作的关键。农业社和生产队都要有专人负责管理耕畜工作，制定贯彻繁殖耕畜计划。湖北省荆门县双喜社就是由于采用了上面所说的办法，九十多头母牛在三年内共生了二百零一头小牛，每年平均繁殖率达70％以上。
    根据社内可繁殖母畜头数配备足够的种公畜，是当前要做的一件事情。如果种耕畜不足，可以恢复役用的种公畜为种用；乡、社之间也可以相互调剂使用。农业社商请附近机关、部队在这方面给以支援，也是一个办法。
    繁殖耕畜的季节也是农活繁忙的时期，因此有些农业社的干部和社员怕母畜怀胎产仔耽误生产，而不愿繁殖耕畜。这个问题是可以解决的。可以将母畜合理搭配到各生产队，用副业牲畜调剂农忙用畜；也可以根据农事活动分期分批配种等办法。各农业社可以参照这种办法，及早加以安排。
