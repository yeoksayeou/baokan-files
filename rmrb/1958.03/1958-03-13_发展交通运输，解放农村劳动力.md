    Developing Transportation to Liberate Rural Labor
    By Our Reporter Ji Xichen
    "We want to increase production and leap forward, but what if we can't transport the harvested grain?"
    "How can we keep up with the great leap forward in industry and agriculture by relying only on carrying loads on our shoulders?"
    "When will we be able to put down the carrying pole that weighs us down?"
    Amidst the high tide of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, as millions of Sichuan peasants, with the heroic spirit of overturning mountains and seas, are using their hands to cut off mountain tops, open up terraces, bring water to the mountains, carry soil and plaster mud, transform barren soil into fertile land, and bravely march toward nature, many peasants have raised the issue of improving transportation tools when discussing the arrangement and use of labor.
    Contradictions Become More Prominent in the High Tide
    The rich rural areas of Sichuan do not have vehicles pulled by livestock like in the north, nor do they have as many civilian boats as in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. For many generations, the vast majority of materials have relied on shoulder carrying for transportation. This backward transportation method not only fails to meet the needs of rapid industrial and agricultural development and modern transportation tools such as automobiles, trains, and ships, but also seriously affects the development of agricultural productivity. In the high tide of the great leap forward in agricultural production, this contradiction between production and transportation becomes even more prominent.
    Why is this?
    First, shoulder carrying requires more people, more effort, and occupies a lot of labor from agricultural production. Currently, an average of 1.2 million able-bodied laborers in Sichuan province work on the transportation front every day, crossing mountains and rivers. Last year alone, 150 million labor days were used for grain transportation. If the more than 8.7 billion jin of grain stored in the province by manual carrying is calculated at an average distance of 15 kilometers and 45 kilograms per person per trip, it would require more than 400,000 laborers to transport it for a year. In Guanzi Township, Dachuan County, the 5,200 main laborers spend an average of 26 days per person per year transporting grain. As a result of a large amount of labor being invested in transportation, many agricultural cooperatives are unable to spare more manpower for accumulating fertilizer, improving soil, building water conservancy projects, and improving farming techniques. In Longtan District, Fuling County, more than 5,600 laborers are engaged in manual carrying all year round, accounting for 13% of the total labor force in the district. According to surveys, if this part of the labor force is put into agricultural production, the district could increase the planting of double-cropping rice by 59,000 mu, and at a yield of 150 jin per mu, it could increase the production of more than 8 million jin of rice, equivalent to 9% of the district's total annual grain output. However, when using labor, the district often faces the contradiction of not being able to balance production and transportation, resulting in not only 20 million jin of surplus grain being unable to be transported out, but also 400,000 jin of oilseed cake fertilizer not being delivered to the fields when topdressing is urgently needed, affecting the increase in crop production.
    Second, shoulder carrying not only has a small transportation volume, but also high transportation costs. Many abundant products have been stockpiled because they cannot be transferred out in time. Sichuan's grain output ranks first in the country. Over the past five years, although the province's farmers have sent more than 50 billion jin of grain to national warehouses and transported 14.6 billion jin of grain out of Sichuan by shoulder carrying, there are still many "dead-end grains" that cannot be transported out of remote mountainous areas. The total value of local specialties in the province is 1.32 billion yuan per year, but only 186 million yuan can be transferred out to supply exports. In addition, the freight rate for shoulder carrying is twice that of human-pulled carts, five and a half times that of automobiles, and seventeen times that of wooden boats. Due to the high freight rates, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and fertilizers that rural mountain areas urgently need cannot be fully supplied; local specialties that urgently need to be sold cannot be transported out in time. Due to transportation difficulties in Tongjiang County, new-style agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-shared plows are all transported up the mountain by shoulder carrying, and the transportation cost alone is more than ten yuan per piece. The public grain paid by local farmers over the years has turned into 70,000 tons of "dead-end grain" that has been stockpiled for five or six years because it cannot be transported out. Of the county's more than 600 kinds of local specialties such as white wax, medicinal materials, and raw lacquer, only 300 kinds can be purchased and sold. Many local specialties have to be painfully discarded on the ground and burned as firewood because they cannot be transported out. This situation not only affects the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and the improvement of people's lives, but also hinders the mobilization of farmers' enthusiasm for production. Some farmers said, "It's really heartbreaking to see increased production that can't be transported out!"
    Therefore, how to further develop water and land transportation, improve transportation tools, and provide cheap and large-volume transportation conditions for industrial and agricultural production, so as to gradually liberate millions of rural laborers from the transportation method of shoulder carrying and invest them in the high tide of the great leap forward in agricultural production, is an urgent problem to be solved in current production.
    Realizing the Urgent Wishes of the People of Sichuan
    Developing transportation is the most urgent wish of the people of Sichuan. In the past few years, the Party and the government have made great efforts to build water and land transportation in order to meet the people's wishes. At present, in addition to the Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Chengdu, Chongqing-Qijiang, and Neijiang-Zigong railway trunk lines, there are also 15,000 kilometers of highways, 12,000 kilometers of waterways, 6,000 kilometers of cart tracks, and 16,000 kilometers of pack animal roads in the province. In addition, there are 12,000 kilometers of small and large roads. Of the 195 counties in the province, only 78 counties were accessible by vehicles before liberation, and now 151 counties are accessible by vehicles. Although this preliminary water and land transportation network has eased the contradiction between production and transportation, transportation still cannot keep up with the needs of rapid industrial and agricultural development. In order to adapt to the new situation of the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Sichuan transportation department, while continuing to implement the policy of facing the countryside and facing the mountainous areas, has decided to focus on the development of mountainous transportation and to build a local road network in a planned way. This year, in addition to planning to build more than 11,000 kilometers of simple highways, cart tracks, and pack animal roads, it also strives to build 5,000 kilometers of simple highways (excluding roads for industry, mining, and forestry), 50,000 kilometers of cart tracks suitable for different terrain conditions and able to fully utilize human and animal power, and 50,000 kilometers of pack animal roads within five to seven years, and to connect these roads with highway trunk lines. In this way, all regions, autonomous prefectures, and counties in the province, except for individual counties in remote mountainous areas, can have smooth highways, and counties, districts, and townships without highways can also have smooth cart tracks and pack animal roads.
    When building these roads, all localities, according to the needs of transportation development, and in accordance with the principles of "spending less money and building more roads," "using local materials, being economical and practical, and not wasting land," have carried out transportation construction planning from top to bottom. In some places, discussions and debates have also been launched among the masses on what kind of roads should be built in various places and which kind of roads are the most cost-effective. During the discussion of roads in Fuling County, the masses unanimously agreed that it is best to build cart tracks. Cart tracks require less money, less labor, and occupy less cultivated land. As long as the original roads and stone slab roads are improved and widened, the roads can be built with much less cost than highways. In addition, the technical conditions for building cart tracks are simple, and farmers have experience in building roads and ponds. As long as some surveying is done, the masses can construct them themselves. Another advantage of this type of road is that once material and human resources permit, as long as it is slightly widened and improved, it can be converted into a simple highway for cars. After the road from Fuling to Nanchuan was opened, the reduction in shoulder carrying alone saved more than 300,000 labor days for Longtan District, which were invested in agricultural production.
    The 93 rivers that have already been opened to navigation in the province connect 96 counties and cities, and play a huge role in transporting materials and communicating urban and rural exchanges. Inland river transportation requires little investment, yields great results, and has low freight rates. It does not occupy land and has great potential power. The Qianhe River in Chengkou used to be impassable to wooden boats. The local 3,000 tons of tea and raw lacquer were completely transported by human carrying. After rectification and dredging, transportation costs alone were reduced by more than 300,000 yuan. There are more than 400 similar small and medium-sized rivers in the province. In order to make these rivers widely serve transportation, all localities are actively carrying out dredging projects such as filming slots, blasting reefs, and repairing towpaths for navigable rivers, and plan to open up 677 kilometers of new waterways and renovate 1,200 kilometers of rivers this year. After the Datongjiang, Tongjiang River, Changtan River, and Xiaotongjiang in Tongjiang County are renovated, they can increase the transportation volume by more than 200,000 tons per year.
    Boldly Reforming Tools to Increase Transportation Volume
    In order to gradually realize the great ideal of replacing shoulder carrying with vehicle transportation and liberating rural labor, all localities have greatly developed folk transportation tools and carried out bold reforms in technology. The human-pulled carts that were widely promoted after agricultural cooperation will reach 60,000 units in the province this year. This type of cart costs only a hundred yuan, is light, simple, and efficient. After the axle bearing is modified with rolling balls and ball bearings, the speed and load-carrying capacity are significantly improved. One person can pull 500 to 600 kilograms at a time, which is equivalent to more than ten people carrying. In Chengdu, Wenjiang, and other places, human-pulled carts have been converted to human-driven yokes and oxen-pulled, increasing the hauling capacity to 800 to 1,200 kilograms, which is almost equivalent to the load-carrying capacity of a northern rubber-wheeled truck. If the more than 400,000 hand-pushed "chicken carts" on the West Sichuan Plain are changed to larger wooden wheels and rubber bands are added to the wheels, the transportation efficiency can be increased by 30%, which is equivalent to two or three people carrying. The newly trial-produced rubber-wheeled wheelbarrow is light, inexpensive, and can carry 300 kilograms when pushed on a one-meter-wide road. Adding one wheelbarrow can save two or three laborers. In many places in the interior of Sichuan, the yellow cattle originally did not know how to carry goods. This year, Nanchong and other places have added saddles and trained cattle to carry goods, replacing human carrying with animal carrying. It can be foreseen that these ordinary but historically significant technical reforms will have a profound impact on the leap forward in rural productivity.

    发展交通运输，解放农村劳动力
    本报记者　纪希晨
    “我们要增产，要跃进，可是打下粮食运不出去怎办呢？”
    “光靠肩挑人背，怎么能赶上工农业的大跃进？”
    “压在我们身上的这根扁担，要等哪一年才能放下来哟？”
    在工农业生产大跃进的高潮里，当四川千百万农民正以排山倒海的英雄气概，用双手削掉山头，开出梯地，引水上山，担土面泥，变薄土为良田，向大自然英勇进军的时候，一谈到劳动力的安排使用时，许多农民便提出了改进运输工具的问题。
    在高潮中矛盾更突出了
    物产丰富的四川农村，既没有北方牲畜牵曳的车辆，也没有江浙一带那样众多的民船。多少年代以来，十之八九的物资，都依靠着肩挑人背来运输。这种落后的运输方式，不仅不能适应工农业迅速发展和汽车、火车、船舶等现代交通工具的需要，而且严重的影响了农业生产力的发展。在农业生产大跃进的高潮里，这种生产和运输之间的矛盾，就显露得更加突出了。
    这是因为什么呢？
    首先，肩挑人背的运输，用人多，花力大，占去了农业生产的许多劳动力。现在四川全省每天平均有一百二十万青壮年劳动力，翻山跨河奔忙于运输战线。去年仅用于运粮的劳动日就达一亿五千万个。全省靠人力肩挑入库的八十七亿多斤粮食，若平均以运距十五公里，每次每人运四十五公斤计，需要有四十多万个劳动力运输一年。达县罐子乡五千二百个主要劳动力，每年用于运粮的时间，每人平均多达二十六天。许多农业社由于大量劳动投入运输的结果，以致不能抽出更多的人力来积肥、改良土壤，兴修水利和改进耕作技术。涪陵县龙潭区常年从事人力挑运的有五千六百多个劳动力，占全区劳动力总数的13％。据调查：若以这部分劳动力投入农业生产，那么，全区就可增种五万九千亩双季稻，以亩产一百五十斤计，就能增产八百多万斤稻谷，相当于全年全区粮食总产量的9％。但是，这个区在使用劳动力时，由于生产和运输之间常常发生顾此失彼的矛盾，结果不但积压两千万斤余粮运不出来，而且使四十万斤油饼肥料在急需追肥时运不到田间，影响了农作物的增产。
    其次，肩挑人背不但运量小，而且运价大，成本高，许多丰富的物产，都因不能及时外调积压了起来。四川粮食产量占全国第一。五年来，全省农民靠着肩挑人背，虽然曾把五百多亿斤粮食送入了国家仓库，把一百四十六亿斤粮食运出了四川；可是，至今仍有许多“死角粮”，无法从僻远的山区里运出来。全省每年土特产总值十三亿两千万元，可是，现在能调运出来供应出口的只有一亿八千六百万元。加以肩挑人背的运价两倍于人拉架车，五倍半于汽车，十七倍于木船。由于运价太高，山区农村迫切需要供应的农药、农械、化肥，得不到充分的供应；急需向外推销的土特产，也不能及时运出来。通江县由于交通运输困难，双轮双铧犁等新式农具全靠肩挑人背送上山，每一部仅人背运费就得十多元。当地农民历年缴纳的公粮，因为运不出来，有七万吨变成了“死角粮”一直积压了五六年。全县的白蜡、药材、生漆等六百多种土特产，能收购运销出来的只有三百种，不少土特产都因无法运出，不得不忍痛弃之于地，焚烧当柴。这种情况，不仅影响城乡物资交流和人民生活的改善，而且也妨碍了农民生产积极性的发挥。有些农民说：“看到增产的东西运不出去，实在痛心咧！”
    因之，如何进一步发展水陆交通，改进运输工具，为工农业生产提供廉价量大的运输条件，以便把千百万农村劳动力，逐步从肩挑人背的运输方式中解放出来，投入农业生产大跃进的高潮，是当前生产中急待解决的问题。
    实现四川人民迫切的愿望
    发展交通运输，是四川人民最迫切的愿望。几年来，党和政府为满足人民的愿望，曾以极大的力量进行了水陆交通的建设。现在全省除成渝、宝成、重庆至綦江、内江至自贡等铁路干线外，还有一万五千公里公路，一万二千公里航道，六千公里架车道，一万六千公里驮运路，此外，尚有小、大路一万二千公里。省内一百九十五个县，解放前只有七十八个县通车，现在已有一百五十一个县通了车。这个初步形成的水陆交通运输网，虽然缓和了生产和运输之间的矛盾，但是，交通运输仍然赶不上工农业迅速发展的需要。为适应工农业生产跃进的新形势，四川交通部门，在继续贯彻面向农村、面向山区的方针中，决定以发展山区交通为重点，有计划的建设地方道路网。今年除计划修筑一万一千多公里的简易公路、架车路和驮运路，还争取在五至七年内修建五千公里简易公路，（不包括工矿、森林用路）五万公里适宜于不同地形条件的又能充分利用人、畜力的架车道，以及五万公里的驮运路，并使这些道路与公路干线联结起来。这样，全省除开边远山区的个别县城外，所有各专区、自治州和县之间就可以畅通公路，不通公路的县、区、乡之间也可以畅通架车道和驮运道了。
    在兴修这些道路的时候，各地根据运输发展的需要，按照“少花钱，多修路”、“就地取材、经济适用、不浪费土地”的原则，从上到下进行了交通建设的规划。有些地方，对于各地应该兴修什么样的道路，那一种道路最划算，还发动群众进行了讨论和争辩。涪陵县在讨论道路时，群众一致认为修架车道为最好。架车花钱少、费工不多，占用耕地面积少，只要把原有的道路和石板的大道改善加宽，用少于公路很多造价就可以把路修好。加以修架车道技术条件简单，农民又有修路修塘的经验，只要稍加勘测，群众自己就可以施工了。这种道路的另一优点是，一旦物力人力条件许可时，只要稍微加宽改善，就可改变为行驶汽车的简易公路。涪陵到南川的道路修通后，由于减少了肩挑人背运输，仅龙潭一个区就节省了三十多万个劳动日投到农业生产。
    全省已经通航的九十三条河流，联系着九十六个县市，对运输物资沟通城乡交流起了巨大作用。内河航运投资小，收效大，运价低，既不占用土地，又具有巨大的潜在力量。城口前河原来不通木船，当地的三千多吨茶叶、生漆完全靠人力挑运，经过整治疏通以后，单运费就节省了三十多万元。全省类似这样的中小河流有四百多条。为使这些河流广为运输服务，各地对能够通航的河流，积极进行拍槽、炸礁、整修纤道的疏浚工程，计划今年新辟航道六百七十七公里，整修河道一千二百公里。通江县的大通江，通江河、长滩河、小通江经过整治后，一年就可以增加二十万吨以上的运输量。
    大胆改革工具提高运输量
    为了逐步实现以车辆代替肩挑人背运输，解放农村劳动力的远大理想，各地大量发展民间运输工具，并在技术上进行了大胆的改革。农业合作化以后普遍推广的人拉架架车，今年全省将达六万辆。这种车每部只百多元，轻便、简单、运效高，车轴承经过改装滚珠和弹子盘以后，车速和载重量显著提高，一人一次能拉五六百公斤，相当于十多人挑。成都、温江等地的人拉架车，改为人驾辕、牛马牵曳后，拉运量增至八百至一千二百公斤，几乎相当于北方胶轮大车的载重量。安岳县城北乡农业社原来的粮食、肥料、煤全靠人来挑，现在新购买七十部架子车，运输重大东西不再要用人挑，把节省出来的四万多个劳动日用在精耕细作上。川西平原上的四十多万部手推鸡公车，如把木轮改大，轮上加胶带，运输效率可提高30％，相当于两三个人挑。新试制的胶皮独轮车，轻捷价廉，推行在一公尺宽的路上，能载三百公斤，增加一部独轮车就可节省两三个劳动力。四川内地许多地方的黄牛原来都不会驮运，今年南充等地则增添鞍具，训练牛驮，用驮运代替人挑。可以预见，这些平凡的但却是具有重大历史意义的技术改革，对农村生产力的跃进将会有深远的影响。
