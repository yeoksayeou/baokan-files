Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 19th: A twenty-four-hour general strike by 350,000 public utility workers in West Germany and West Berlin, protesting the employers' refusal to increase wages, has completely paralyzed the public transportation and water, electricity, and gas supplies in more than 150 cities and towns in West Germany and West Berlin since this morning.

The streets of West Berlin presented an unusual scene today. In the morning and evening, tens of thousands of bicycles were riding on the main thoroughfares. From dawn, all trams, trolleybuses, buses, and subways were completely out of service. The elevated trains under the administration of the Berlin Democratic District also completely stopped stopping at West Berlin stations today. All the gates of West Berlin's elevated railway stations were locked. This support measure taken by the German Democratic Republic's National Railway Administration at the suggestion of the Free German Trade Union Federation was warmly welcomed by the 32,000 striking workers in West Berlin. A few hours after the public transport workers began their strike, street sweepers, sewer workers, and workers in water and gas plants also began to strike. Apart from units such as fire brigades and funeral parlors, all work in municipal enterprises came to a standstill. The city's theaters, cinemas, and other public entertainment venues announced that performances were suspended due to the lack of heating caused by the heating workers' strike. Some schools also closed due to the lack of heating. It is said that a strike of this scale has not been seen in Berlin since 1932.

A report from the Stuttgart Public Utility Workers' Union Executive Committee stated that the fighting spirit was high everywhere. Dortmund Public Utility Workers' Union Secretary Jullinsky told a reporter from "Berliner Zeitung" that "union members believe that this strike for wage increases is closely related to the expansion of armaments in the Federal Republic."

According to West Berlin's Economic Director Hertz, the economic losses to business owners caused by the general strike will amount to eight to ten million marks.

    数十万公用事业工人大罢工
    西德一百多城市陷于瘫痪
    据新华社柏林19日电　西德和西柏林的公用事业工人三十五万人为抗议资方拒绝增加工资从今晨起举行的二十四小时大罢工，使西德的一百五十多个大小城市和西柏林的市内公共交通和水、电煤气的供应完全陷于瘫痪。
    西柏林的街头今天出现了异乎寻常的现象。早晨和傍晚，通衢大道上行驶着数万辆自行车。从凌晨起所有电车无轨电车公共汽车和地下车全部停驶。柏林民主区管辖的高架电车今天也完全不在西柏林的车站停留。西柏林的所有高架电车站的大门都上了锁。民主德国国家铁道管理局根据自由德国工会联合会的建议而采取的这项支援措施，受到了西柏林三万二千罢工工人的热烈欢迎。在公共交通工人开始罢工数小时以后，扫街工人、下水道工人、自来水厂和煤气厂的工人也纷纷开始罢工，除了消防队和殡仪馆这种单位以外，一切属于市政企业的部门的工作都停顿了下来。市内的剧场、电影院和其他公共娱乐场所因为暖气工人罢工没有暖气而宣布停演。某些学校也由于没有暖气而停课。据说在柏林出现这样规模的罢工还是1932年以来所没有过的现象。
    来自斯图加特公用事业工会执行委员会的报告说，到处的斗争情绪都很高昂。多特蒙德公用事业工会书记尤林斯基对“柏林新闻社”记者说，“工会的会员们都认为这次为要求增加工资而举行的罢工，是同联邦共和国的扩军有紧密关系的”。
    据西柏林经济局长赫茨估计，大罢工给企业主们带来的经济损失将达到八百万到一千万马克。
