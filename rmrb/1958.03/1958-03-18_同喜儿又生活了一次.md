Tong Xier Lives Again
Wang Kun

During the National Day celebrations in 1955, I met Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko in Beijing. She told me that they had adapted "The White Haired Girl" into a ballet and had begun performing it in Japan. From that day on, I began to look forward to seeing this bold and ingenious creation of hers.

On March 13th, this "White Haired Girl," which had been enhanced by Japanese artists, met us in the capital. My excitement was indescribable. Although I sat quietly in the audience, from the moment the music of "The North Wind Blows" began in the orchestra pit until the final overthrow of the landlord and the rising of the brilliant sun, for the entire duration of the play, I lived once again with the character I had been creating for thirteen years—Xier. How many times had I shed tears for Xier's misfortune? Watching Matsuyama's performance, I really wanted to calm down and consciously put myself in the actress's perspective, to learn from Matsuyama how to understand the character and how she expressed Xier's personality and emotions. However, the further the play unfolded, the more I lost control, and I still shed tears in several places.

Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko is an artist of extraordinary talent. She used the art form of ballet to create the image of a Chinese woman who transforms from a pure and kind girl into a brave and strong person who heroically resists evil forces. Ms. Matsuyama said: "'The White Haired Girl' has an essential connection with Japanese farmers. I am sure that the hatred for the old society written in 'The White Haired Girl' is not only the hatred of the Chinese people but also the hatred of the Japanese people and the hatred of people all over the world." I believe that Matsuyama Mikiko found this correct key, which is why she achieved such success.

From the beginning, Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko attracted the entire audience with the image of a pure and innocent young girl. Ms. Matsuyama used her rich ballet technique to express Xier's complex emotions of worrying about her old father and hating the landlord. Dachun comforted her and gave her spiritual encouragement. In the "North Wind Dance" danced by Xier and Dachun, Ms. Matsuyama meticulously depicted this mood. On the one hand, she confided in Dachun: she had closely tied her heart to Dachun's heart. On the other hand, she constantly looked at the street leading to the Huang family's compound, hoping for the old man's safe return home. This dance was very moving.

The unfortunate experiences of losing her dependent father and beloved brother Dachun caused a great change in Xier's character. In the second act, Ms. Matsuyama used only a few "sketches" to vividly express Xier's melancholy, pain, and resentment. Her firm will when she decided to escape after being humiliated was also very prominent. In the third act, Xier's life underwent drastic changes again: she lived a life in the mountains that was neither human nor ghost, but she did not despair. She wanted to live and take revenge. The "Dance of the White Haired Girl" fully demonstrated Xier's indomitable fighting spirit. Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko's performance with Mr. Komori Yasuo and Mr. Kimata Sadao was very realistic, the scene arrangement was very good, and it also fully utilized the techniques of ballet. In the third scene of the third act, Xier and Dachun reunited. Their pas de deux moved the hearts of every audience member. Everyone was happy for their happy reunion. Suddenly, Xier covered her face, lowered her head, and knelt in front of Dachun. The audience knew at a glance that she remembered the humiliation she had suffered while feeling happy. But under Dachun's comfort, she stood up strongly again.

Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko's performance was truly vivid, detailed, simple, and powerful. She did not damage the character's image and complex inner life because she used rich ballet techniques; nor did she weaken the characteristics of ballet and its diverse expressive techniques because she demanded a realistic and complete expression of the character's personality. In the past, I had wondered whether it was appropriate to use the European ballet form to express the story of the class struggle of Eastern nationalities like "The White Haired Girl." After seeing Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko's performance with my own eyes this time, this question was completely resolved.

Mr. Ishida Taneomi, the actor who played Dachun, also gave a simple and moving performance, creating the image of a cheerful and strong-willed young peasant. In the third act, after he joined the Eighth Route Army and returned home, he was full of spirit and high in revolutionary spirits, bringing a new atmosphere to his hometown.

The peasant images that appeared on the stage were all realistic. Mr. Honda Shizuo's portrayal of Uncle Zhao, a generous, knowledgeable, and selfless peasant elder, left a deep impression on the audience. The portrayal of the negative characters was also unique. Mr. Komori Yasuo, who played Huang Shiren, fully demonstrated the landlord's insidious, vicious, and inhumane qualities. He also had a unique creation in terms of technique. When he first appeared, I was worried about his long leather robe. How could a ballet dancer dance with his legs completely covered by clothes? The clever actor was good at using his waist and leg skills to swing the leather robe left and right. In this way, the leather robe not only did not restrict the dance but also helped shape the image.

In general, the director and actors were very successful. From the perspective of the script arrangement, the editor was also very clever and bold. On the one hand, he tried his best to maintain the theme of the opera "The White Haired Girl," and on the other hand, he was able to select plots and scenes suitable for the characteristics of the ballet and adapt and develop them. Therefore, the "White Haired Girl" they rehearsed this time was relatively concise. The group dance and mass scenes in the first act also embodied the class friendship between the peasants and their common hatred for the landlord, showing the potential great revolutionary power of the Chinese peasants.

To Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko, Mr. Shimizu Masao, Mr. Hijikata Yoshi, Mr. Ishida Taneomi, Ms. Kodaira Etsuko, Ms. Konishi Ryoko, Ms. Kakinuma Tazuko and the friends of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, I, as a Chinese woman and as an actress, express my deep gratitude to you. Through your efforts, "The White Haired Girl" can be performed in Japan, further developing cultural exchanges between China and Japan and enhancing mutual understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people.

The preparation process for the ballet "The White Haired Girl" says: "The incredible and various oppressions still weigh heavily on the Japanese people. But we firmly believe that a person should have tenacious vitality, that is, should be like Xier, and live strongly in any difficult environment. 'The old society turns people into ghosts, and the new society turns ghosts into people.' This is a reality, and it should be transformed into the Japanese people's own lofty ideals, and be sung aloud. ... Xier lives in the hearts of us Japanese people."

What touching words! We will always remember these words, always remember your performance in China, and always remember the Japanese people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people.

    同喜儿又生活了一次
    王昆
    1955年国庆时，我在北京会见了松山树子女士，她告诉我，她们已把“白毛女”改编成芭蕾舞剧开始在日本上演了。从那一天起，我就开始盼望，盼望有一天能看到她这一大胆天才的创作。
    3月13日，这一个被日本艺术家增添了光彩的“白毛女”在首都和我们见面了。我的兴奋是难以形容的，我虽然静静地坐在观众席里，但从乐池里响起了“北风吹”的音乐之后，直到最后地主被斗倒，绚丽的太阳升起来，整整一出戏的时间里，我又和我十三年来创作着的角色——喜儿一起生活了一次，我曾经为喜儿的不幸遭受流过多少次眼泪。看松山的表演，我真想冷静一些、有意识的把自己置身于演员角度、向松山学习如何体会人物以及她如何表现喜儿的性格和感情。但是，戏越展开，我就越不能自持，在好几个地方还是掉下热泪了。
    松山树子女士是一个有非凡才能的艺术家，她用芭蕾舞这一艺术形式创造了一个从纯洁、善良的女孩到勇敢坚强、向恶势力进行英勇反抗的中国妇女的形象。松山女士说：“‘白毛女’与日本农民有本质的联系，我确信‘白毛女’中所写的对旧社会的憎恨不单是中国人民的憎恨，同时也是日本人民的憎恨、全世界人民的憎恨。”我相信松山树子正是找到了这把正确钥匙，才得到这样的成功。
    松山树子女士一开始就以一个纯洁天真的少女形象吸引了全体观众。松山树子运用了她丰富的芭蕾舞技术表现了喜儿为老父亲担忧、对地主愤恨的复杂感情。大春安慰她，给了她精神上的鼓舞。在喜儿和大春同跳的“北风舞”中，松山树子十分细腻的描绘了这种心情。她一方面向大春吐露衷肠：她已将自己的心和大春的心紧密地系在一起了，一方面她又时时看着通向黄家大院的街道，盼望老人平安回家，这一段舞是十分动人的。
    失去了相依为命的老父亲和相爱的大春哥的不幸遭遇，使喜儿的性格发生很大变化。在第二幕，松山树子只是“素描”几笔就把喜儿那种忧郁、悲痛和愤恨的感情鲜明地表达出来了。她在被污辱以后，决定逃走时的坚决意志也表现的很突出。在第三幕，喜儿的生活又经历了剧烈的变化：她在山里过着人不像人，鬼不像鬼的生活，但她不绝望，她要活下去，要报仇。“白毛女之舞”充分表现了喜儿不屈不挠的斗争精神。这一场松山树子女士和小森安雄、木俣贞雄两位先生的表演是很逼真的，场面编排的很好，也充分运用了芭蕾舞的技巧。到了三幕三场，喜儿和大春重逢了，他们的双人舞激动了每个观众的心，大家都为他们幸福的重逢而高兴。突然喜儿掩住脸，低下头，跪在大春面前，观众一看就知道她在感到幸福的时候，想起了自己所受的污辱。但是在大春慰抚下，又坚强地站起来了。
    松山树子女士的表演真是生动细致、朴实有力，并没有因为运用了丰富的芭蕾舞技巧，而损伤了人物的形象和复杂的内心生活；也没有因为要求真实地、完整地表现人物的性格而削弱了芭蕾舞的特点和多样化的表现技巧。过去我曾想过像白毛女这样表现东方民族的阶级斗争的故事，用欧洲芭蕾舞剧形式来表现是否调和的问题，这次亲眼看松山树子女士的表演，这种疑问就完全解决了。
    饰演大春的演员石田种生先生的表演也很朴实动人，创造了一个性格明朗、意志坚强的青年农民的形象。在第三幕他当了八路军回家以后，精神焕发、革命情绪昂扬，为家乡带来了新的气氛。
    舞台上出现的农民形象都是真实的。本多静雄先生扮演的赵大叔，性格豪放、有见识，肯舍己为人的农民长者给观众深刻的印象。反面人物的塑造也有独到之处。演黄世仁的小森安雄先生完全表现出了地主恶霸阴险毒辣、毫无人性的特质。在技巧上他也有独特的创造，他一出场，我曾为他的皮长袍担心，一个芭蕾舞演员的腿全部让衣服盖住了怎样舞法呢？聪明的演员，他善于利用自己腰腿的功夫，左右开弓，把皮长袍甩起来，这样，皮长袍不但没有限制舞蹈，而且利用它帮助了形象的塑造。
    总的来说，导演与演员都是很成功的。从剧本的编排来看，编者也很聪明、大胆。他一方面尽量保持歌剧“白毛女”的主题思想，而又能选择适合舞剧特点的情节和场面加以改编和发展。因此，这次他们排演的白毛女比较精练。在第一幕中的集体舞和群众场面也体现了农民之间的阶级友情和对地主的共同仇恨，显示了中国农民的潜在的伟大的革命力量。
    以松山树子女士、清水正夫先生、土方与志先生、石田种生先生、小平艳子女士、小西两子女士、柿沼田鹤子女士为首的松山芭蕾舞团的朋友们，我，作一个中国妇女、作为一个演员向你们表示深切的感谢，经过你们的努力，能使“白毛女”在日本演出，使中日文化交流得到更进一步的发展，使中国和日本人民增进相互了解。
    芭蕾舞剧“白毛女”上演筹备经过中说：“难以置信的种种压迫仍然沉重地压在日本人民头上。但是我们深信：一个人应该具有顽强的生命力，就是说，应该像喜儿那样，在多么艰苦的环境中也要坚强地活下去。‘旧社会把人逼成鬼，新社会把鬼逼成人’这是一个现实，应当把它变成日本人民自己的崇高理想，而高声歌唱。……喜儿活在我们日本人民的心中。”
    这是多么打动人心弦的话呀！我们将永远记住这些话，永远记住你们在中国的演出，永远记住日本人民对中国人民友好的感情。
