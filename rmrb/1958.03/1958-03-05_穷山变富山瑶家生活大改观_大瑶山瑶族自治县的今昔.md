    Poor Mountains Transformed into Rich Mountains: Great Changes in the Lives of the Yao People
    —The Past and Present of the Dayao Mountain Yao Autonomous County
    Jin Baosheng (Yao Nationality), Deputy Commissioner of Ping Le Prefecture, Guangxi

    In eastern Guangxi, nestled among the mountains, lies a narrow valley of less than three square miles. In the interwoven terraced fields stand rows of brand-new buildings, both multi-storied and single-story: factories, schools, cultural centers, broadcasting stations, supply and marketing cooperatives, post and telecommunications bureaus, banks, bookstores, hospitals, people's markets, sports fields… What a beautiful scene, a prosperous sight! This is the heart of Dayao Mountain after liberation – Jinxiu.

    In recent years, great progress has been made in Dayao Mountain's agriculture, forestry, cash crops, animal husbandry, and more. Taking agricultural production as an example, in the past, each person faced an average grain shortage of four months per year; now, they are basically self-sufficient. The days of "living on half a year's grain and half a year's wild vegetables and bran" are gone forever.

    In 1957, the Jintong Highway from Jinxiu to Tongjiang officially opened to traffic. When the first car drove into Jinxiu, the Yao people, supporting the old and leading the young, flocked in from all directions, crowding the road. Tao Daoli, a 64-year-old from Jintian Township, Jin Tian, bowed to the car with his hands clasped, expressing the feelings of the Yao people in a mountain song:

    Since Pangu to this day,
    We've climbed mountains and waded through rivers on foot;
    Now comes the Communist Party,
    No need to strain to reach heaven or earth.
    Jinxiu Yao Mountain is connected by cars,
    Every Yao person is overjoyed;
    Life was bitter in the past,
    Life will be sweet in the days to come.

    Indeed, the smooth flow of the road has brought untold benefits to the Yao families: local products are selling well, and daily necessities can be transported in large quantities. The price of fragrant herbs has increased from 43 yuan per dan to 53 yuan; salt, which used to cost 15 jin of rice per jin, now costs only two mao.

    Speaking of the past and present of Dayao Mountain's cultural and educational undertakings, we must first start with the story of "mice stealing work points." In the winter of 1955, the agricultural cooperative of over a hundred households in Guitian Township, Changdong District, Dayao Mountain, was established. However, since no one in the entire township could read, they had to use corn kernels to record work points. The members carefully stored the corn kernels, which represented work point tokens, in bamboo tubes, to be used as the basis for calculating labor remuneration at the end of the year. But, the mice ate these "work points" just like ordinary grain, causing great difficulties for the year-end distribution.

    However, for the new generation of Dayao Mountain, the "mice stealing work points" incident will never happen again. Since liberation, the seeds of culture have been sown throughout the Yao mountains. By 1956, the number of schools had increased to 89, with 3,820 students, of whom 1,894 were Yao. In 1954, the first Yao junior high school was built here.

    The liberated people of all ethnic groups urgently need the cultural and recreational life that they could not enjoy, nor had the heart to enjoy, in the past. The county has established one cultural center, two film projection teams, one wired broadcasting station, and 88 rural clubs.

    "Poor mountains become rich mountains, and the lives of the Yao people have greatly changed." When the Yao people sing these two lines of mountain songs from the bottom of their hearts, they all sincerely say: "Communist Party, oh Communist Party, you are even closer than the Yao family's parents, you are even sweeter than the Yao family's honey!"

    穷山变富山瑶家生活大改观
    ——大瑶山瑶族自治县的今昔
    广西平乐专区副专员　金宝生（瑶族）
    在广西东部，群山环抱中，有一片不到三平方里的狭长谷地。在绵互的梯田中，矗立着一幢幢崭新的楼房、平房：有工厂、学校、文化馆、广播站、供销社、邮电局、银行、书店、医院、人民市场、运动场……。好一片秀丽风光、繁荣景象，这便是解放后的大瑶山的心脏——金秀。
    几年来，大瑶山的农业、林业、经济作物、畜牧业等都有了很大发展。拿农业生产来说，过去每年每人平均缺粮四个月，现在基本上能够自给自足了。“一年生活半年粮、半年野菜和老糠”的日子已经一去不复返了。
    1957年，由金秀到桐江的金桐公路正式通车了。当第一辆汽车驶入金秀的时候，瑶族人民扶老携幼地从四面八方赶来，把公路围得水泄不通。金田乡有位六十四岁的老人家陶道立，拱手向汽车拜了几拜，用山歌表达了瑶族人民的心意：
    自从盘古到如今，爬山涉水用步行；如今来了共产党，上天入地不劳神。金秀瑶山通汽车，瑶民个个喜连天；过去生活苦又苦，日后生活甜又甜。
    的确，公路畅通，给瑶家带来了说不尽的好处：土特产畅销了，日用品可以大量运进来了。香草每担由四十三元提高到五十三元；食盐过去用十五斤米才能换一斤，现在两毛钱就能买到了。
    谈到大瑶山文教事业的今昔，首先要从“老鼠偷工分”的故事说起。1955年冬天，大瑶山长垌区的桂田乡一百多户的农业社建立起来了。可是，全乡没有一个识字的人，没有办法，只好用苞米记工分。社员都把那代替工分牌的苞米珍藏在竹筒里，留待年终分配时作为计算劳动报酬的依据。但是，老鼠像偷吃普通粮食一样地偷吃了这些“工分”，给年终分配带来了很大困难。
    可是，对于大瑶山新生的一代来说，这种“老鼠偷吃工分”的事，再也不会出现了。解放以来，文化的种子，已撒遍了瑶山。1956年，学校增加到八十九所，学生三千八百二十人，其中瑶族学生就占一千八百九十四人。1954年，这里兴建了第一所瑶族初级中学。
    解放了的各族人民，迫切需要他们过去所不能享受、也无心情享受的文化娱乐生活。全县已建立了文化馆一个、电影队二队、有线广播站一个、农村俱乐部八十八个。
    “穷山变富山，瑶家生活大改观。”当瑶族人民从心里唱出这两句山歌来的时候，他们都衷心地念着：“共产党呀共产党，您比瑶家的爷娘更亲，您比瑶家的蜜糖更甜！”（附图片）
