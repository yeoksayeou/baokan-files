Yunnan Women Can Do the Work of Men
Manure Accumulation, Water Control, and Tree Planting - All Are Possible

(This newspaper reports) In the current production campaigns of water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and processing of spring crops in Yunnan Province, women are playing a significant role. In advanced areas, women's attendance rate reaches over 90%, while in general areas, it is around 70% to 80%. In Qujing, Yuxi, Chuxiong and other places, men have all gone to large and medium-sized water conservancy construction sites, while activities such as small-scale water conservancy, manure accumulation, building pigsties, cattle sheds, toilets, and processing of spring crops are almost entirely carried out by women. Moreover, many women have also learned to plow fields, dig fields, and use handcarts and drive ox carts. Naxi women of Baisha Agricultural Cooperative in Lijiang County average 300 workdays per person per year, with some reaching 320 days. Since last winter and this spring, they have accumulated 46,340,000 catties of human and animal manure. Women in Jiangchuan County have proposed: "Women must be able to do the work of men," and they will complete twenty-four "Women's Dams" and afforest eight hundred mu of barren mountains by the end of March. Women in Qujing County are designating March as Women's Manure Accumulation Month, with each woman accumulating 3,000 catties of manure, and each household raising a brood of chicks.

    云南妇女要抵男子用
    积肥治水植树样样能
    本报讯　云南省在当前兴修水利、积肥、小春加工等生产运动中，妇女们发挥了重大的作用，先进地区妇女出勤率达90％以上，一般地区也在70％至80％左右。在曲靖、玉溪、楚雄等地，男人都到大、中型水利工地去了，而小型水利、积肥、盖猪厩、牛厩、厕所及小春加工等活动，几乎全部落在妇女身上。并且很多妇女还学会了犁田、挖田及使用手推车、赶牛车等等活计。丽江县白沙农业社纳西族妇女，一年平均每人出勤三百天，有的达三百二十天，去冬今春以来，已积得人畜肥料达四千六百三十四万斤。江川县的妇女提出：“妇女要抵男人用”，3月底就要完成妇女坝二十四个，绿化荒山八百亩。曲靖县妇女把3月份作为妇女积肥月，每个妇女积肥三千斤，每家还抱一窝小鸡。
