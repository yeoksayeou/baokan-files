Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 5th: With the arrival of warmer spring weather and the beginning of mosquito and fly breeding, the people of the capital will launch a spring campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, striving to achieve "four-free" and "three-clean" status in areas inhabited by 70% of the city's population, or three million people, by the end of April. This decision was made at an expanded meeting of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee today.

The main tasks of the two-month spring campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in the capital, starting from March 5th, are: to vigorously eliminate mosquito and fly breeding conditions, eradicate newly hatched mosquitoes and flies, and universally and thoroughly dig up and destroy fly pupae; to continue to adopt a method combining poisoning and hunting to further eliminate domestic rats and sewer rats, excavate field mice, and destroy nests and eggs to kill sparrows; to conduct a city-wide clean-up in preparation for the May Day holiday; and to expand and deepen the development of competition activities.

The meeting pointed out that the people of the capital had achieved great success in the winter campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. By the end of February, the city had eliminated more than 2.8 million rats and sparrows, and 9,209 "four-free" areas and units had emerged.

This newspaper reports that in recent days, the people of the capital have launched a large-scale campaign to dig up and destroy fly pupae. According to incomplete statistics from seven districts, about 10,000 jin of fly pupae have already been dug up.

The Xuanwu District organized more than 5,000 cadres, students, and residents to participate in two days of voluntary labor to dig up pupae. They dug up more than 60 jin of fly pupae in nearly 2,000 manure heaps, toilets, livestock sheds, and other places. The 209 pupae-digging teams in Chongwen District dug up 164 jin of fly pupae after three days of concentrated effort.

The suburbs of Beijing are also actively participating in the pupae-digging work. Two townships in the eastern suburbs dug up 52 jin of fly pupae and more than 160 cartloads of fertilizer while renovating 64 toilets, which both improved sanitation and accumulated fertilizer.

    北京春季除四害运动展开
    乘胜追击不让蚊蝇繁殖
    据新华社5日讯　春暖到来，蚊蝇开始孳生繁殖，首都人民将开展春季除四害、讲卫生运动，争取4月底在占全市人口70％的三百万人口的地区作到“四无”和“三洁”。这是北京市爱国卫生运动委员会今天召开的委员扩大会议上决定的。
    从3月5日起为时两个月的首都春季除四害、讲卫生运动的主要任务是：大力消灭蚊蝇孳生条件，灭绝初生蚊蝇，普遍彻底挖砸蝇蛹；继续采取毒杀与捕打相结合的方法，进一步消灭家鼠和沟鼠，挖掘田鼠，掏窝毁卵捕杀麻雀；迎接“五一”节进行全市大扫除；扩大深入开展竞赛活动。
    会议指出，首都人民冬季除四害讲卫生运动取得了很大成绩。到2月底止全市已消灭鼠雀二百八十万多只，涌现出九千二百零九个“四无”地区和单位。
    本报讯　连日来，首都人民展开了大规模的挖砸蝇蛹活动。据七个区的不完全统计，已经挖得蝇蛹一万斤左右。
    宣武区组织了干部、学生、居民五千多人，进行了两天挖蛹的义务劳动。他们在近两千处粪堆、厕所、牲畜棚等处，挖出蝇蛹六十多斤。崇文区的二百零九个挖蛹队，经过三天突击，挖到蝇蛹一百六十四斤。
    北京郊区也积极参加了挖蛹工作。东郊区的两个乡在翻修的六十四个厕所中，挖出蝇蛹五十二斤和一百六十多车肥料，既改善了卫生，又积了肥。　　　（幼德）（附图片）
