    进一步改善对城乡居民的医疗服务
    苏联制定保健七年远景计划
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联卫生部和苏联医学科学院会同各种专科的医学科学家制订了1959年—1965年苏联发展卫生保健事业的远景计划。
    为了进一步改善对城市和乡村居民的医疗服务，苏联准备到1965年年底把病床数量增加为1956年的两倍，医生人数增加55％以上。
    积极预防是苏联卫生保健组织的基本方针。苏联到1959年年底就能消灭疟疾。在消灭疟疾以后，从事消灭疟疾的卫生机关和医务工作人员将抽调出来帮助预防和治疗肠虫和内脏虫。苏联还准备在最近几年内使肠胃病和儿童传染病大大减少，使小儿麻痹症的患病率减少三分之二到四分之三。
    苏联正在制定预防和治疗结核病的措施，采取这些措施以后，到1965年底，结核病发病率将会大大减少，这样就可能提出把结核病作为普遍性疾病来消灭的任务。
