    Great Leap Forward Based on the Widespread Development of Mass Literary Activities!
    Chen Baichen
    In the past, theater troupes constantly complained about a shortage of scripts, while playwrights complained about not having enough time. With the Great Leap Forward, every theater is tapping its potential and can create hundreds or even thousands of scripts on its own. Playwrights, under the pressure of this situation, are also working at full speed, setting plans for ten or eight scripts per year. It is evident that the issue lies in mobilizing the masses.
    Literary creation is inherently a mass activity, not the exclusive domain of a few writers. A Great Leap Forward in literary creation cannot reach great heights or go far without mass creation as its foundation and leaven. The momentum of the leap forward in novels and poetry is not as strong as in drama, perhaps for this reason.
    Therefore, during the Great Leap Forward in literary creation, we must not forget to do more groundwork: we must widely develop literary groups in factories, rural areas, government offices, and schools. Young authors emerge from here, and the reserve force of writers is cultivated here. We say that the younger generation pushes the older generation forward, which shows that without the younger generation, the older generation will retreat or stagnate. Without successors, lacking stimulation, the leap forward cannot leap far. This is the first point I want to make.
    Secondly, how can writers themselves leap forward? I agree with Comrade Xia Yan that we must also pursue more, faster, better, and more economical results. In recent years, some writers have not written anything at all. This is due to laziness or other reasons, such as myself, which is to be blamed, so let's not talk about it for now. What I want to talk about are other writers who have the time to write and can write more, but they write slowly and produce little. They only seek the word "good." This is the "not to cry until it hurts" principle. It is not necessarily a sister to the "one-bookism," but there is some connection. Writing a one-act play takes three months, and a full-length play takes two years. This is already beyond the scope of "slow and meticulous work" and is "dragging one's feet." And the result is not necessarily "amazing." We demand works that have been tempered and refined, but not every subject matter, not every work can withstand such tempering. Some become complete after only a few strokes. Releasing them early also benefits the readers. This is called giving off as much light and heat as one has. Moreover, isn't it common for some works to be hammered dozens of times only to disappear without a trace and be declared scrapped?
    Therefore, things that are worth and can withstand tempering should be tempered, otherwise, readers would prefer you to produce more and faster. Of course, they also hope for a little "economy," that you write more concisely. And writing more and faster also ensures the possibility of "good"; "good" inevitably includes "economy."
    For the sake of true "good," we must eliminate the intermediate state—that is, being both slow and little while not being amazing—and develop towards two extremes: on the one hand, meticulously crafting truly amazing works, and on the other hand, timely and abundantly reflecting the current reality struggle. A truly great writer will unify these seemingly opposite extremes in himself.
    It sounds simple, but it is quite difficult to implement. But the main difficulty is only one point, that is, clarifying the purpose of writing: is the writer's writing a small component of the great socialist cause, or is it a tool for personal fame and fortune? Solving this problem makes one a writer of the people!

    在广泛展开群众性的文学活动的基础上大跃进！
    陈白尘
    过去，剧团老嚷嚷剧本荒，剧作家则嚷嚷没有时间。大跃进一来，每个剧院挖掘潜力，自己都可以创作出论百上千的剧本；剧作家在这形势催逼之下，也都快马加鞭，订出每年十个、八个剧本的计划。可见得问题也在于发动群众。
    文学创作本来是群众性活动，并不是少数作家们专有的事业。文学创作大跃进，如果没有群众创作做基础，做酵母，是跃不高、跃不远的。小说、诗歌方面跃进的劲头儿不及戏剧方面，其原因之一，也许在此。
    因此，在文学创作大跃进的时候，不能忘记同时要多做些奠基工作：要广泛开展工厂、农村、机关、学校里的文学小组。青年作者是从这里产生的，作家的后备军是从这里培养的。我们说，后浪推前浪，可见没有后浪，前浪要后退或停顿的。后继无人，失了刺激，跃进也跃不了多少。这是我要说的第一点。
    其次，作家们自己如何跃进呢？我同意夏衍同志说的，也要多、快、好、省。最近几年来，有些作家们根本没写，这是由于懒或者另有原因，比如我自己，那是该责备的，先不谈它。我想说的是另外一些作家，他有时间写，也能多写，但就是写得慢、写得少。他求的仅是一个“好”字。这是“不鸣则已，一鸣惊人”主义。它不一定是“一本书主义”的姊妹，但也有点瓜葛。一个独幕剧要写三个月，一个长剧要写二年，这已经出乎“慢慢出细货”的范围，是“磨洋工”了。其结果呢，也不一定“惊人”。我们要求有千锤百炼之作，但不是任何一个题材，任何一篇作品都经得起千锤百炼的。有的三锤两锤也就成了。及早出炉，对读者也有一定的益处。这叫做有几分热发几分光。而且有些作品锤了几十锤就锤得无影无形，宣告报废了的，不是常见的么？
    因此，值得、也经得起千锤百炼的东西，应该千锤百炼，否则，读者是宁愿你多一点、快一点的。当然，同时也希望“省”一点，写得精炼一些。而多写、快写，也保证了“好”的可能性；“好”之中也必然有“省”。
    为了真正的“好”，必须消灭中间状态——就是既慢且少而又不惊人的状态，而向两极发展：即一方面精工雕琢真正惊人之作，一方面及时地多多地反映当前的现实斗争。真正伟大的作家，这表面的两极会在他身上统一起来的。
    话说起来很简单，实行起来可不少困难。但主要的困难只有一点，即弄清楚写作的目的：作家的写作到底是作为社会主义伟大事业中一个小小构成部分呢，还是作为个人成名成家的工具呢？解决了这个问题，那就是一个人民的作家！
