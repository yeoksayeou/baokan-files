Viewing Revolutionary Traditions Through Art

A "Hungarian Revolutionary Art" exhibition was recently held in Budapest, displaying nearly 700 paintings and sculptures by Hungarian art masters of the past century. This exhibition once again proves that the realist origins of outstanding Hungarian artists lie in their close connection with the people, and that they are forever the spokespersons for the people's suffering and joy.

At the exhibition, one could see the works of outstanding Hungarian artists from the end of the last century. Munkácsy's (1844-1900) painting "Strike" expressed deep sympathy for the oppressed. The works of plein air painters such as Fényes Adolf, Lévi and Kernstok Károly sharply criticized the exploitative social system. Their works exposed and criticized reality, and some artists' works, such as the aforementioned "Strike" and Kernstok's "Agitator" (see picture above), already reflected the organized strength of the working class.

Although the Hungarian Soviet Republic only existed for a few months, works about it occupied an important position in the exhibition. The artists profoundly exposed the bloody rule of the fascists after the overthrow of the Republic. Derkovits' works against tyranny were the sharpest and most profound. This painter even lost his life because of it. His paintings were specially displayed in a room.

Among the works after the liberation of Hungary, those reflecting the horrific scenes of the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion and the victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionaries were the most striking.

The exhibition vividly demonstrates the great revolutionary tradition of Hungarian plastic arts and has been praised by the Budapest audience. (Picture attached)

    从艺术品看革命传统
    最近布达佩斯举行了“匈牙利革命艺术”展览会，陈列了近百年来匈牙利艺术大师们的七百多件绘画和雕塑。这个展览会再一次证明，匈牙利优秀艺术家们的现实主义渊源于同人民的密切联系，他们永远是人民疾苦与欢乐的表达人。
    在展览会上可以看到上世纪末匈牙利优秀艺术家们的作品。蒙卡奇（1844—1900）的画“罢工”表达了对被压迫者的深刻同情。菲?什、列维斯和凯伦什托克等写生画家的作品尖锐地批评了剥削者的社会制度。他们的作品揭露和批判了现实，有些画家的作品，如上面谈到的“罢工”和凯伦什托克创作的“鼓动家”（见上图）等，已经反映出工人阶级的有组织的力量。
    匈牙利苏维埃共和国虽然只存在了几个月，但是关于它的作品在展览会上占有重要地位。艺术家们深刻地揭露了共和国被推翻以后法西斯的血腥统治。台尔科维奇的反对暴政的作品最尖锐，最深刻。这位画家甚至因此而丧失了生命。他的画专门陈列在一间屋子里。
    在匈牙利解放以后的作品中，反映1956年反革命叛乱的恐怖情景和镇压反革命胜利的作品最引人注意。
    展览会鲜明地表现出匈牙利造型艺术的伟大革命传统，得到了布达佩斯观众的称赞。（附图片）
