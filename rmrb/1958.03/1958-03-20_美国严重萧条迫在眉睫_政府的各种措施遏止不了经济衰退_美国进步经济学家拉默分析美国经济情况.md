Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: The American "Worker's Weekly" recently published an article by Hyman Lumer stating, "The American economy today is on the brink of a severe depression, which currently appears more imminent than at any time since the end of World War II."

This article is an abstract of a report submitted by Lumer to the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, analyzing the causes of the current economic recession in the United States and the American government's countermeasures.

Lumer points out that there are many strong reasons to believe that the current recession in the United States is more severe than previous ones. These include the following:

First, a major factor stimulating investment after the war no longer exists. The need for housing and certain durable consumer goods persisted for a long time after the war and is now almost non-existent. Today, the most prominent feature of the American economy is a large and growing surplus of total production capacity, leading to an almost universal decline in investment.

Second, the further expansion of consumer credit (i.e., installment buying) is limited by certain factors. One is the current large amount of debt. In many families, installment payments account for more than 20% of the total family income, and these families do not have the strength to increase their current debt much further. In addition, disposable income is decreasing due to reduced workdays and shutdowns. This, coupled with job insecurity, further limits their ability to take on new debt.

Third, the "prosperity" of Western Europe has now ended, so there is no prospect of improvement in American foreign trade.

Fourth, in 1950, American "prosperity" was largely due to a massive increase in military spending. But the planned increases now are far from sufficient to offset the decline in capital investment. American economist Victor Perlo once pointed out that the planned increase in major military material purchases in the first half of 1957 was $1 billion per month, while new orders for durable goods have decreased by an average of $2 billion per month since the beginning of 1957.

Lumer points out that the current economic situation once again demonstrates that the American economy is fundamentally unstable. The inherent basic contradictions of capitalist production are not weakening but becoming more acute.

Lumer points out that the measures taken by the U.S. government to prevent economic depression primarily involve increasing military spending, especially on missiles, which is the so-called "guns instead of butter" plan. For example, in Eisenhower's plan to strengthen major weapons procurement, a full 75% of the increased spending is for missiles and other new weapons. But the arms budget does not provide a real solution. Because weapons must come at the cost of increased inflation, high taxes, and the sacrifice of social welfare. More seriously, they are accompanied by new threats to democratic freedoms, first and foremost the increased threat of atomic war. At the same time, the proposed missile production program offers relatively little employment hope for unemployed workers, as it does not involve large-scale production techniques requiring a large workforce. It should be noted that although military orders have been increasing since last fall, the economy has been in recession.

Another key point of the Eisenhower administration's plan to deal with the economic recession is to manipulate credit and interest rates. The U.S. government initially adopted a tight credit policy to deal with inflation. Later, as signs of economic recession became more and more apparent, the Federal Reserve Board repeatedly lowered the discount rate. However, business loans continued to decrease. In January, the Federal Reserve Board also reduced the required stock margin from 70% to 50% in order to make it easier to buy stocks, leading to price increases, in an attempt to create a psychology that encourages investment and new stock issuance. In reality, however, this measure will have little effect other than encouraging speculation and allowing stockbrokers to make more profit.

Lumer said that in addition to these measures that mainly benefit large corporations, the Eisenhower administration is doing little or nothing. For example, in the areas of housing and public works, there are no plans other than implementing some parts of the plans passed before the economic recession. The author points out that, clearly, the government is currently mainly trying to cope with the economic recession by "restoring confidence" through optimistic predictions.

    美国严重萧条迫在眉睫
    政府的各种措施遏止不了经济衰退
    ——美国进步经济学家拉默分析美国经济情况——
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”最近刊载了希曼·拉默的一篇文章说，““今天的美国经济正处在一次严重萧条的边缘，目前看来这个萧条比自从第二次世界大战结束以来任何时候都更加迫在眉睫”。
    这篇文章是拉默提交给美国共产党全国委员会的一项报告的摘要，它分析了目前美国经济衰退的原因和美国政府的对策。
    拉默指出，有许多有力的理由使人认为美国目前的衰退比以往各次更为严重。其中包括下列几点：
    一、战后刺激投资的一个主要因素不再存在了。对住房和某些耐久消费品的需要在战后持续了一个长时期，现在快要不存在了。今天美国经济最突出的特点是总的生产能力的大量过剩和愈来愈过剩，因而导致投资的几乎普遍的下降。
    二、消费者信贷（按：即分期付款购货办法）的进一步扩大受到某些因素的限制。其一是目前债务的数目很大。在很多家庭里，分期付款要占全家收入的20％以上，这些家庭没有力量再把它们现在的欠债增加很多。此外，由于每周工作日减少和停工的缘故，能随意使用的收入也愈来愈少。这一点，再加上职业没有保障，就进一步限制了它们承担新的债务。
    三、西欧的“繁荣”现在已经结束，因此美国的对外贸易看不出会好转。
    四、在1950年，美国的“繁荣”在很大程度上是由于军事开支大规模的增加。但是现在计划中的增加数量远不足以抵销资本投资的下降。美国经济学家维克托·佩洛曾经指出，1957年上半年主要军事物资采购的计划的增加数每月为十亿美元，而耐用货物的新订货从1957年初以来每月平均减少二十亿美元。
    拉默指出，目前经济情况再一次表明，美国经济基本上是不稳定的。资本主义生产固有的基本矛盾不是在减弱，而是变得更尖锐了。
    拉默指出，美国政府为了防止经济不景气而采取的措施，首先是增加军费开支，特别是导弹方面的开支，这就是所谓“大炮代替牛油”的计划。例如在艾森豪威尔加强主要武器采购计划中，增加的费用整整75％是用于导弹和其他新武器方面。但是武器预算并没有提供真正的解决办法。因为武器必须以增加通货膨胀，征收高额税款和牺牲社会福利为代价。更严重的是，随着它们而来的是对民主自由的新的进攻威胁，首先是原子战争威胁的增加。同时，所拟议的导弹生产计划对于失业工人所提供的就业希望也比较小，它并不牵涉到要求大批人员就业的大规模生产技术。应该指出，尽管自从去年秋季以来军火定货单一直在增加，然而经济却一直在衰退。
    艾森豪威尔政府对付经济衰退的计划的另一个要点是操纵银根和利率。美国政府起初采取抽紧银根的办法来对付通货膨胀。后来，由于经济衰退的迹象愈来愈多，联邦储备委员会已经多次降低贴现率。可是，企业贷款还是继续减少。在1月份，联邦储备委员会还把必需的股票保证金从70％减到50％，目的是要使购买股票较为容易，导致价格上涨，企图造成一种鼓励投资和新股票的发行的心理。然而，实际上，这个措施除了鼓励投机和使得股票经纪人获得更多的利润外不会有什么大作用。
    拉默说，除了这些主要有利于大企业的措施外，艾森豪威尔政府很少做什么工作或者一点也没有做什么工作。例如在住房和公共工程方面，除了执行在经济衰退前所通过的计划的某些部分外就没有什么别的计划。作者指出，显然，政府目前主要是企图用乐观的预言来“恢复信心”的办法来应付经济衰退。
