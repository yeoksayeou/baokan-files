    The Fragile "Free World"

    An Associated Press report states that the U.S. government would rather choose Geneva than the United States as the location for a top-level meeting. It is said that this is because the U.S. government fears that Khrushchev might achieve a huge propaganda victory during such a visit.

    The ruling figures of the American ruling group have constantly boasted about how "free" America is, how "prosperous" it is, and how others are infatuated with their "free world." However, despite all the boasting, they themselves actually lack confidence in the "free world" they boast about. Because they are even afraid of Khrushchev visiting their "free world."

    From this, people can see just how fragile the so-called American "free world" really is.

    脆弱的“自由世界”
    美联社报道，美国政府宁愿选择日内瓦而不愿选择美国为最高级会议的地点。据说，这是因为美国政府担心，赫鲁晓夫可能会在这样一次访问中取得巨大的宣传胜利。
    美国统治集团的当权人物曾不断地吹嘘美国是如何的“自由”，如何的“繁荣”，以及别人又是如何地醉心于他们的这个“自由世界”。然而，吹嘘尽管吹嘘，可是，实际上连他们自己对他们所吹嘘的那个“自由世界”也是没有信心的。因为，他们甚至害怕赫鲁晓夫到他们的那个“自由世界”去访问。
    从这里，人们可以看出，所谓的美国的那个“自由世界”是多末脆弱的一个世界。
