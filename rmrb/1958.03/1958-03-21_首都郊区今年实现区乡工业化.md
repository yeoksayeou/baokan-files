Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: While achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production, the suburban areas of Beijing are also mobilizing the masses to vigorously develop industry, striving to have the output value of local industries in the suburbs surpass agriculture this year, basically realizing district and township industrialization.

In accordance with the policy of serving agricultural production, all suburban districts of Beijing have begun to plan for more than twenty industrial projects as the first step in developing district and township industries this year. These industries are: agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing, electric motor repair, tire retreading, large vehicle repair and manufacturing, low-grade cement, small-scale hydropower generation, chemical fertilizers, papermaking, printing, sugar refining, as well as the mining of gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, asbestos, mica and other minerals, according to the urgent needs of the local area. Each township will build a roughage processing plant and a granular fertilizer plant. Each central market town will complete the construction of a small agricultural machinery repair plant before mid-April to support spring plowing.

This year, the second step in Beijing's plan to develop district and township industries will be to decentralize a batch of existing local industries and handicrafts in the suburbs, and to move some of the local industries and handicrafts urgently needed by the countryside from the city to the suburbs and towns, so as to quickly establish a network of district and township industries.

Beijing's suburbs originally had seven districts, and recently five counties and one city were transferred from Hebei Province, totaling more than two million agricultural population. The original industrial base in these areas was very weak. Some districts, apart from some handicrafts and rural side occupations, did not even have a single factory. In the high tide of agricultural production, the broad masses of cadres and people in the suburbs are urgently demanding to develop industry, so that industry and agriculture can promote each other and leap forward together.

The district and county Party committees in the suburbs attach great importance to the development of district and township industries, and the Party secretaries personally grasp industry. They plan and act simultaneously, doing whatever they say. Shunyi, Tongxian and other five counties and one city have decided to work hard for one year, focusing on key projects under the principle of mainly using local materials for raw materials, mainly selling products locally, mainly raising funds by themselves, mainly training their own technical forces, and mainly relying on themselves to solve production equipment, so as to promote the widespread flowering of general industry and strive to increase industrial output value by five times compared with last year. The CPC Jingxi Mining District Committee has established an industrial planning team, which plans to lead the masses to build more than thirty factories in this mountainous area this year, and to exploit various mineral deposits. Small coal mines alone can produce more than 400,000 tons of coal this year. In order to implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily and to achieve immediate results, Tongxian has decided to use all existing vacant houses as factory buildings and not to build new ones. The Nanyuan District Paper Mill has already begun designing. The Zhoukoudian Low-Grade Cement Plant is about to officially go into production.

In order to promote the industrialization of districts and townships in the suburbs, the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee has carried out a series of preparatory work such as ideological mobilization, investigation and research, and overall planning. The relevant industrial departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee have transferred about two hundred lathes, donkey engines and other equipment to support the industrial construction of the suburbs. Some industrial technical schools in Beijing have also organized teams to go to the countryside to provide technical assistance. Many factories in Beijing are starting to mobilize some older veteran technicians who live in the suburbs to go to the countryside to run industries. The donkey engine training class run by the Beijing Municipal Transportation Bureau has trained more than 700 car drivers who can use and repair donkey engine technology and will soon be sent to the countryside.

### 首都郊区今年实现区乡工业化

    首都郊区今年实现区乡工业化
    据新华社19日讯　北京市郊区在实现农业生产大跃进的同时，正在发动群众大力兴办工业，争取郊区的地方工业产值在今年内赶过农业，基本上实现区、乡工业化。
    根据为农业生产服务的方针，北京市各郊区已经分别开始筹建二十多个工业项目，作为今年发展区、乡工业的第一个步骤。这些工业是：根据本地迫切需要的农业机械修造、电机修理、轮胎翻修、大车修造、低标号水泥、小型水力发电、化学肥料、造纸、印刷、制糖，以及金、银、铜、铁、煤、石绵、云母等矿的开采。各乡建设一个粗饲料加工厂和一个颗粒肥料厂。各中心集镇在4月中旬以前完成一个小型农业机械修理厂的建设，支援春耕。
    今年，北京市发展区、乡工业计划中的第二个步骤，将是把一批现在郊区的地方工业和手工业下放，并且把一部分农村迫切需要的地方工业和手工业从城里搬往郊区的城、镇，以便把区、乡工业网迅速建立起来。
    北京市郊区原有七个区，最近又从河北省划过五县一市，共有二百多万农业人口。这些地区原来的工业基础很薄弱，有的区除了一些手工业和农村副业以外，连一个工厂也没有。在农业生产高潮中，郊区广大干部和群众迫切地要求发展工业，使工农业互相推动，共同跃进。
    郊区各中共区委、县委对发展区、乡工业十分重视，党委书记都亲自抓工业。他们边计划，边行动，说干就干。顺义、通县等五县一市决定今年苦干一年，在原料以就地取材为主、产品以当地推销为主、资金以自筹为主、技术力量以自己培养为主、生产设备以依靠自己解决为主的原则下，抓紧重点工程，促使一般工业遍地开花，争取工业产值比去年提高五倍。中共京西矿区区委成立了一个工业规划小组，今年准备领导群众在这个多山的地区建设三十多个工厂，并且要开采各种矿藏，仅小型煤矿今年就可以生产煤四十多万吨。通县为了贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针和达到马上见效的要求，已经决定把现有的空房一律作为工厂厂房，不另行建设。南苑区的造纸厂已经开始设计。周口店的低标号水泥厂即将正式投入生产。
    中共北京市委为了促进郊区区、乡工业化，进行了思想动员、调查研究、全面规划等一系列的准备工作。北京市人民委员会有关的工业部门已经抽调出二百台左右的车床、锅驼机以及其他一些设备，支援郊区的工业建设。在北京的一些工业技术学校，也组织了到农村去进行技术援助的队伍。北京市很多工厂，正在开始动员一部分年纪较大而家又在郊区的老技术工人，到农村去办工业。北京市运输局开办的锅驼机训练班，已经训练出能够使用和修理锅驼机技术的七百多个汽车司机，即将派往农村。
