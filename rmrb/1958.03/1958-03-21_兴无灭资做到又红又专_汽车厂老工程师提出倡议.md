    (Reported by our newspaper) Sun Shunli, Shi Rujie and 19 other veteran engineers from the First Automobile Works, proposed an initiative to all engineering and technical personnel in Jilin Province: Dedicate your hearts to the Party, be both Red and Expert, even more Red and more Expert, and be determined to become genuine working-class intellectuals within two years.

    (1) Wholeheartedly accept the leadership of the Party, dedicate your hearts to the Party, and follow the Party forever.

    (3) Overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in work style, eliminate the "five airs," and muster revolutionary vigor. Vigorously cultivate experimental plots, go deep into the front lines, closely connect with the masses, solve practical problems, and strive to combine politics with professional work, technology with labor, and theory with practice.
    (4) Implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and running enterprises through diligence and thrift, to ensure the fulfillment of national tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    (5) Actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, study and apply the new achievements of other countries in the world in science and technology, and strive to master our own profession within three years. Earnestly grasp automobile design and production technology, in order to meet the country's requirements for multi-variety production of automobile factories.
    (6) Rely on the leadership of Party committees at all levels and the supervision of the masses, formulate and implement personal plans, organize self-study groups, summarize thoughts every six months, conduct criticism and self-criticism within the groups, and conduct mutual evaluations to seek common improvement.
