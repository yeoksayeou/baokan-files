    Two Kinds of Competition Styles
    Liu Feng
    In the past two years, an undesirable trend of "comparing" became popular among some people. What they compared was nothing more than the amount of salary, the level of position, the facing of the house (south or north), the soft or hard seat on the train, the quality of clothing material, the number of diamonds on the watch, the brand of the pen, and so on. At that time, bourgeois individualism was greatly on the rise, absolute egalitarianism was rampant, hatred of low income and complaints about high expenses were rampant, and evil spirits were greatly rising. This is an undesirable way of comparing.
    However, after last year's anti-Rightist struggle and the ongoing rectification movement, the social atmosphere has undergone tremendous changes, and a new kind of "competition" has emerged. This is a competition of enthusiasm, competition of advancement, competition of work, and competition of learning. Non-stop, forge ahead. The evil spirit of comparing extravagance and waste has been defeated, and a new atmosphere has been established, such as the one proposed by many agricultural cooperatives in Hubei: "Only compete with others in farming, not with others in celebrating the New Year." The unhealthy trend of comparing levels and treatment has been defeated, and a new atmosphere of requesting to lower excessively high levels and treatment, and requesting to abolish unreasonable subsidies has been established. Recently, the voluntary request of some famous actors in Shanghai to lower their excessively high salaries is an even more prominent event. In the past, the idea of acting for fame and fortune was very serious among actors. They would compare who was listed first, and who had more "bao yin" (performance fee). But now the view is different. They realize that the high income of famous actors violates the socialist distribution principle, and is far from the living standards of the working people, hindering the policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. When they compared themselves with industrial labor models, they realized that labor models contribute greatly to the country, but their income is much lower than their own. This further proves that their income is unreasonably high. This is a remarkable transformation. After such an increase in awareness, now they are competing for more performances, more profits turned over to the state, more new plays, and fewer people in the troupe. From individual competition to collective competition, collective competition! From this, we can see that there was one way of comparing in the past, and now there is another way. The previous comparison was to haggle over personal interests, a kind of discouraging comparison, which resulted in slow, poor, and wasteful results, and took the capitalist road, which would lead to self-degradation. The current comparison will form more, faster, better, and more economical results, which will greatly promote our society, and we will also be motivated. This kind of comparison is a promoting comparison. What we need is this promoting comparison.
    In the past, the longer it took to deliver photos or laundry, the more it showed that the brand was well-known, the business was booming, and they were overwhelmed. Some laundry shops in the peak season even delivered the laundry after forty or fifty days, taking pride in being slow. But now this trend has also changed, changing from comparing slowness to comparing speed. The laundry industry has changed from delivering laundry in one week to three days, and the express laundry department delivers it on the same day. Photo studios have shortened the time it takes to get photos from fifteen days to three days. These are just two small examples, but from here, we can also hear the sound of our society's rapid progress.
    Don't be afraid of not recognizing the goods, only be afraid of comparing goods. Comparison and competition are good methods. Good and bad can be compared, and advanced and backward can be contested. "Comparison" will bring socialist enthusiasm. Without evaluation and competition, the advanced may become backward due to complacency, and the backward may remain backward forever.
    Evaluation not only compares economy, production, and technology, but also compares politics, to see who is better. We must test ourselves in this competition, and not fall behind!

    两种比的风气
    刘丰
    前两年在一部分人中，流行一种不好的“比”的风气。他们所比的不外乎是待遇的多少，级别的高低，住房的朝南朝北，坐火车的软席硬席，衣服料子的好坏，手表的钻石多少，钢笔的牌子如何等等。那时资产阶级个人主义大大抬头，绝对平均主义甚嚣尘上，恨收入小，怪开销大，邪气大大上升。这是一种要不得的比法。
    然而，经过去年的反右派斗争，和继续到现在的整风运动，社会风气为之大变，也就产生了一种新的“比”。这就是比干劲、比先进、比工作、比学习。马不停蹄，一往直前。比铺张浪费的邪气被打倒了，树立了像湖北许多农业社提出的“只跟人家赛种田，不跟人家比过年”的新风气；比级别比待遇的歪风被打掉了，树立了要求降低过高的级别待遇、要求取消不合理补助的新风气。最近上海一些名演员自动要求降低过高的薪金，更是一件突出的事。过去在演员中唱戏是为名为利的思想很严重，动不动就比挂牌谁先谁后，比包银谁多谁少。可是现在看法不同了，他们认识到，著名演员的高额收入是违背社会主义分配原则的，而且远离劳动人民生活水平，妨碍了文艺为工农兵服务的方针。他们和工业劳动模范一比，认识到劳动模范对国家贡献大，但收入比自己少得多，这更证明自己的收入高得不合理。这是一个了不起的大转变。在这样提高了觉悟之后，现在他们是比演出的场次多，比上缴利润多，比谁新戏多，比那个剧团人少。从个人的比发展到集体的比，集体的竞赛！从这里可以看出，从前是一种比法，现在又是一种比法。从前的比是斤斤计较个人利益，是一种促退的比法，它造成了少慢差费，走的是资本主义道路，会叫自己堕落。现在的比法则会形成多快好省，叫我们的社会大大跃进，自己也会奋发起来。这种比法是一种促进的比法。我们需要的就是这种促进的比法。
    从前照像洗衣交件时间越长，越表现这家牌子响，生意兴隆，应接不暇。有的洗衣铺在旺季甚至四、五十天后才交活，以慢为荣。可是现在也改变了这种风气，变比慢为比快了。洗衣业已从过去的一个星期交活改为三天，快洗部当天交活；照像馆从过去十五天才能取到相片缩短为三天。这只是两个小例子，但从这里，也可以听到我们的社会一日千里的脚步声。
    不怕不识货只怕货比货。比较、竞赛是一个好方法，好和坏可以比较得出，先进和落后可以较量一番。“比”会带来社会主义的干劲。不评比，不竞赛，先进的由于自满得意可能变为落后的，落后的也可能永远落后。
    评比不仅比经济、比生产、比技术，还要比政治，看谁更好一些。我们要在这比赛中来考验一下自己，不要落在后头！
