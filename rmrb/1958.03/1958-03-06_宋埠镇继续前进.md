    Songbu Township Continues to Advance
    (Our report) Songbu Township, Hubei Province, which has set a brilliant example in supporting agriculture, has taken another step forward in supporting rural work.
    The Songbu Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held consecutive meetings of cadres, various systems, and residents, calling for boosting revolutionary drive and doing a better job in supporting rural areas. Currently, nearly a hundred people from the commercial sector are delivering goods to townships, cooperatives, construction sites, and fields. Bamboo, wood, iron, and other handicraft cooperatives are rushing to produce large quantities of earth manure carts for rural areas. Cotton seedling nutrient containers and wheat field thinning hoes are also being produced. A granular fertilizer factory built by the supply and marketing cooperative has already been put into production. The experimental fields planted by the township's government cadres in the agricultural cooperatives are doing well in field management and preparations for plowing.

    宋埠镇继续前进
    本报讯　在支援农业方面作出光辉榜样的湖北省宋埠镇，支援农村的工作又向前迈进了一步。
    中共宋埠镇委最近曾连日召开干部会、各系统会和居民会，要求鼓足革命干劲，把支援农村的工作做得更好。目前，商业部门有近百人把货物送到乡、社、工地和田间。竹木铁等手工业社正在分别为农村赶制大批土粪车。棉花育苗营养器、麦田疏行锄。供销社兴建的一个颗粒肥料工厂已经投入生产。这个镇上的机关干部在农业社种的试验田，田间管理和备耕工作都搞得很好。
