    New Feed Crusher Outperforms "Fiona"
    In early March, the Jinling Machine Manufacturing Plant in Nanjing successfully trial-produced a Jinling 58-type hammer mill universal feed crusher. This feed crusher has a high output rate, low power consumption, small size, and simple structure. It can crush more than 270 jin of straw per hour. Its performance has surpassed that of the "Fiona" type feed crusher produced in the United Kingdom.

    新的饲料粉碎机性能超过“非又纳”
    南京金陵机器制造厂在3月上旬，试制成功一种金陵58型锤磨式万能饲料粉碎机。这种饲料粉碎机出率高、耗电低、体积小、结构简单。每小时可以粉碎稻草二百七十多斤。它的性能已超过了英国出产的“非又纳”型饲料粉碎机。
