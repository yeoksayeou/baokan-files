To Consolidate the Results of the Rectification Campaign in Three Types of Cooperatives

Tianjin Prefecture Sends Cadres to Strengthen Leadership in Three Types of Cooperatives

(Our report) The Tianjin Prefecture of Hebei Province is taking various measures to strengthen the leadership of the three types of cooperatives that have completed rectification and to consolidate the results of the rectification campaign.

More than 300 of the prefecture’s 700-plus three types of cooperatives have undergone rectification. These rectified cooperatives have corrected their political direction, established the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, improved their management, and generally initiated a surge in production, changing their backward appearance. However, these cooperatives have not been fully consolidated. Not only do some issues left over from the rectification need to be resolved, but some new contradictions have also emerged. The class line was implemented during the rectification, and more cadres were removed or replaced (according to key investigations, the number of removed or replaced cadres accounted for 37% of the original cooperative cadres, and new cadres accounted for 47% of the existing cadres). Some of the removed cadres in some cooperatives were not convinced and undermined the new cadres; disunity has also occurred among cadres still in office; because the new backbone teams have just been formed, they still lack experience in running the cooperatives well, and the newly established systems still face difficulties in implementation. The reactionary forces that have been overthrown are not reconciled to defeat and are taking every opportunity to carry out overt or covert sabotage activities. The capitalist thinking of some well-to-do middle peasants has not been completely eradicated, and some are not active enough in production.

In order to ensure the healthy development of these cooperatives, various counties have selected strong cadres to work in the cooperatives and strengthen the leadership of the cooperatives. Qingxian, Wen'an and other five counties have sent more than 240 county and district-level cadres to work in these cooperatives for a long time. Before the cadres were sent down, specific plans were made, and different cadres were sent according to the characteristics of different cooperatives. For example, in Anzuxinzhuang Township, Wen'an County, six three types of cooperatives have suffered disasters for many years, their sideline business foundation is very poor, and the lives of cooperative members are difficult. In addition to moving its office to the township to specifically help develop sideline businesses, the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also assigned Chen Baojun, the deputy director, to work in the cooperative. After organization and mobilization, three types of sideline businesses have been launched, increasing the income of cooperative members. In Renqiu, cadres of the Bacun Cooperative were engaged in factionalism and long-term disunity. Later, the county party committee sent Sun Guangyao (the original village party secretary), who had the highest prestige among the masses, back, and quickly solved the problem of disunity. Diquancun Township in Dacheng County assigned five members of the township party committee to take charge of the three newly rectified cooperatives and specifically help with the work in the cooperatives.

    巩固三类社整风成果
    天津专区派干部到三类社加强领导
    本报讯　河北省天津专区采取各种措施，加强对整顿结束的三类社的领导，巩固整风成果。
    这个专区七百多个三类社中已有三百多个经过整顿。整顿过的社，端正了政治方向，树立了贫农、下中农的领导优势，改善了经营管理，普遍掀起生产高潮，改变了落后面貌。但是，这些社还没有完全巩固。不仅在整顿中遗留下来的一些问题需要继续解决，而且又出现了一些新的矛盾。整顿中贯彻了阶级路线，落选和撤换的干部较多（据重点调查，落选和撤换的干部占原有社干部的37％，在现有干部中新干部占47％）。有的社落选的干部不服气，拆新干部的台；在职的干部也有的社发生了不团结的现象；由于新的骨干队伍刚刚形成，还缺乏办好社的经验，新树立的制度，如何贯彻执行还有一定的困难。已被打下去的反动势力，还不甘失败，他们乘一切可乘之机，进行或明或暗的破坏活动。部分富裕中农的资本主义思想还没有彻底根除，有的在生产中还不够积极。
    为了保证这些社的健康发展，各县选派了坚强干部到社任职，加强社的领导。青县、文安等五县，就派了二百四十多名县、区级干部到这些社长期工作。干部下派之前，并作了具体规划，根据不同社的特点，派不同干部。如文安县安祖辛庄乡有六个三类社连年受灾，副业基础很差，社员生活困难。县供销社除将办公室搬到该乡，具体帮助开展副业以外，并将副主任陈宝均放到社内任职。经过组织发动，现已活动起三种副业，增加了社员收入。任丘八村社干部闹宗派，长期不团结。后来县委把在群众中最有威信的孙光耀（原本村支书）派回去，很快解决了不团结的问题。大城县杜全村乡对三个刚整顿结束的社，由五名乡委委员分头包起来，具体帮助社内工作。
