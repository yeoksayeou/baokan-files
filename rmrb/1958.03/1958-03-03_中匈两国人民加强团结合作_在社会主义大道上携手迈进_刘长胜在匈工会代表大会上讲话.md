Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 2nd. Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said at the Hungarian Trade Union Congress on the 1st that the Hungarian working class and people carried out a heroic struggle during the October events. With the support and assistance of the great internationalism of the Soviet Union, they stopped the counter-revolutionary riots, smashed the subversive conspiracy of imperialism, and achieved a great victory. We, like all upright people in the world, heartily cheer for this victory! In this incident, the Hungarian people made significant contributions to consolidating the socialist camp and defending the cause of world peace.

The friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people has been tested in struggle. When the Hungarian working brothers were in a difficult situation, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country gave moral support and material assistance. The Chinese people are also very grateful to the Hungarian people for their various kinds of help and support for our socialist construction. We believe that in the future, we will continue to carry forward this revolutionary tradition of mutual support and unity and cooperation in the cause of socialist construction.

After the October events, the Hungarian people have not only not regressed politically and economically but have also advanced by leaps and bounds. In this short period of more than a year, the Hungarian people have made significant achievements in strengthening the socialist system, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restoring the national economy. The internal unity of the Hungarian people has been greatly enhanced. This cannot but terrify the enemy and gladden friends.

Liu Changsheng then said that the Chinese trade unions are very pleased to see that the Hungarian trade unions have played a significant role in establishing and consolidating the workers' class regime and in the construction of socialism. Now, your trade unions have also taken various measures to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers and staff, to improve labor productivity, and to reduce product costs. In order to closely link with the masses and improve working methods and working styles, effective work has also been carried out. The trade union is carrying out a movement to protect public property in the vast number of workers and staff. We firmly believe that this movement will achieve remarkable results. We warmly congratulate the Hungarian trade unions on the achievements they have made in the cause of socialist construction.

Next, Liu Changsheng briefly described the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the socialist revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. He said that our ability to achieve these achievements is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries and the support of the working classes of various countries.

Liu Changsheng pointed out that now the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country are riding the wind and waves, boosting revolutionary efforts, and striving to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer.

Liu Changsheng continued, the current international situation is entering a new turning point. Socialism, like the rising sun, shines in all directions, while imperialism is at the end of its rope and approaching death. The socialist camp and the world's peace-loving forces have definitively surpassed the forces of the imperialist camp. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, "It is not the West wind that prevails over the East wind, but the East Wind that prevails over the West wind." The Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties is an event of great significance in current world politics. It greatly strengthens the strength of socialist countries and the world communist movement, and greatly strengthens the strength of the broad masses of people in the struggle for peace, democracy, and national liberation.

Liu Changsheng concluded by saying that there is already a deep friendship and cooperative relationship between the Chinese and Hungarian trade unions. May the unity and cooperation between the trade unions of the two countries be strengthened day by day, and may the unbreakable friendship between the people of the two countries develop day by day. For the victory of our common cause of communism, let us, under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, bravely advance on the road of socialist construction with revolutionary heroism!

    中匈两国人民加强团结合作
    在社会主义大道上携手迈进
    刘长胜在匈工会代表大会上讲话
    据新华社布达佩斯2日电　中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜1日在匈牙利工会代表大会上讲话说，匈牙利的工人阶级和人民在十月事件中进行了英勇的斗争，在苏联的伟大的国际主义的支持和援助下，制止了反革命的暴乱，粉碎了帝国主义的颠覆阴谋，取得了伟大的胜利。我们和全世界正直的人民一样，衷心地为这一胜利而欢呼！在这次事件中，匈牙利人民对巩固社会主义阵营和保卫世界和平事业作了重大的贡献。
    中匈两国人民的友谊是经过斗争的考验的。当匈牙利工人兄弟处境困难时，中国工人阶级及全国人民给予了道义上的支持和物质上的援助。中国人民也十分感谢匈牙利人民对我国社会主义建设事业的各种帮助和支持。我们相信今后我们在社会主义建设事业中将继续发扬这种相互支援和团结合作的革命传统。
    匈牙利人民在十月事件以后，在政治上经济上不仅没有后退，而是大踏步地前进了。在这短短的一年多的时间中，匈牙利人民在加强社会主义制度、巩固无产阶级专政和恢复国民经济等方面取得了重大的成就。匈牙利人民内部的团结有了极大的增强。这不能不使敌人为之丧胆，使朋友们感到高兴。
    刘长胜接着说，中国工会十分高兴地看到，匈牙利工会在建立与巩固工人阶级政权和建设社会主义事业中起了重大的作用。现在，你们的工会为了发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，为了提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本，也采取了种种措施。为了密切联系群众，在改进工作方法和工作作风方面，也进行了有效的工作。工会在广大职工中正在开展着保护社会公共财产的运动。我们深信这一运动一定会取得显著的成绩的。我们热烈祝贺匈牙利工会在社会主义建设事业中所获得的成就。
    接着，刘长胜概括叙述了中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面所取得的巨大成就。他说，我们所以能够取得这些成就，是与苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助和各国工人阶级的支持分不开的。
    刘长胜指出，现在中国工人阶级和全国人民正在乘风破浪，鼓起革命干劲，为在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内使中国在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国而奋斗。
    刘长胜继续说，目前国际形势正在进入一个新的转折点。社会主义如旭日初升一样光照四方，帝国主义则日暮途穷临近死亡。社会主义阵营和世界爱好和平的力量已经确定地超过了帝国主义阵营的力量。正如毛泽东同志所说的，“不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风”。莫斯科共产党和工人党代表会议是当前世界政治中一个有伟大意义的事件。它大大加强社会主义国家和世界共产主义运动的力量，大大加强广大人民群众争取和平、民主和民族解放的力量。
    刘长胜最后说，中国工会和匈牙利工会之间已经有着深厚的友谊和团结合作关系，愿两国工会之间的团结和合作日益加强，愿两国人民牢不可破的友谊日益发展。为了我们共产主义共同事业的胜利，让我们在共产党和工人党的领导下，以革命的英雄气概在社会主义建设的大道上勇敢迈进！
