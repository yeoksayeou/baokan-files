Dear guests, comrades!

    The Rally of People from All Walks of Life in the Capital in Support of the Algerian People's Struggle for National Independence now begins.

    As everyone knows, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, which concluded in Cairo on New Year's Day this year, reflected the common will of the Asian and African people. It adopted a series of important resolutions, making significant contributions to promoting the Bandung spirit, promoting the unity of the Asian and African people, striving for and safeguarding Asian-African national independence, and defending the cause of world peace. The conference expressed its firm support for the just struggle of the Algerian people, condemned the barbaric atrocities of the French colonialists in Algeria, unanimously passed a resolution on the Algerian issue, and called on the people of Asian and African countries to hold a "Support Algeria Day" on March 30. In response to this solemn call, mass organizations such as the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the China Islamic Association, the China-Arab United Republic Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Students' Federation, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries have launched a rally of people from all walks of life in the capital to support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence. Today, representatives from all walks of life in our capital, including workers, youth, women, students, culture, industry and commerce, and religion, are participating in this rally. In the name of the Chinese people, we once again declare to the world here: The Chinese people are willing to stand with the people of Asian and African countries, and with the people of the world, to firmly support the just struggle of the Algerian people against French colonialism and for national independence!

    The French imperialists have been carrying out colonial rule in Algeria for one hundred and twenty-eight years, and have been waging a criminal colonial war in Algeria for three years and five months. However, the bloody suppression of colonialism cannot scare the people who demand independence, freedom, and peace. The heroic Algerian people have waged a long and arduous struggle against the French colonialists, and have achieved many major victories. To this day, vast areas of Algeria have been liberated, and their own political power has been established in many regions. The victory of the Algerian people's struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the French colonialists and has inspired the confidence of people all over the world in striving for freedom and peace. We extend our warm brotherly greetings to the Algerian people who are fighting heroically for the independence and freedom of their motherland! We wish the Algerian people a complete victory in their just struggle!

    The Chinese people and the Algerian people and the people of Arab countries began friendly exchanges very early on. The similar situation of being under the oppression of imperialism and colonialism for a long time and the respective struggles for striving for and safeguarding national independence have further deepened our sympathy and concern.

    Our Chinese government and Chinese people have always supported the just cause of the Algerian people and the Arab people, as well as the Asian and African people, in striving for and safeguarding national independence. As early as June 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "In North Africa, the Algerian people are still being forced to carry out armed resistance. The Chinese people support the just struggle of the Algerian people, and at the same time, they cannot but deeply care about the tense situation in Algeria." Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out that "peaceful negotiations should be carried out on the basis of fully recognizing the national aspirations of the Algerian people to restore peace in Algeria." These words fully express the common aspirations of the six hundred million Chinese people. We firmly oppose the colonial rule and imperialist aggression that enslaves and slaughters the people of other countries. We solemnly protest the atrocities of the French colonialists, and we demand that the French government immediately stop the war of slaughtering the Algerian people! Immediately release all innocent patriots! Immediately recognize the independence and freedom of the Algerian people!

    We must also point out that the crimes of US imperialism in continuously supporting France's slaughter of the Algerian people through loans and the supply of munitions are also firmly opposed by our Chinese people. We want to warn all colonialists and imperialists: If you continue to carry out colonial wars and bloody rule in disregard of the people's protests and opposition, you will inevitably suffer the most thorough and most shameful defeat. We firmly believe that the final victory will surely belong to the Algerian people who are fighting for a just cause!

    We Chinese people will always stand with the Algerian people, and we are willing to strengthen unity with the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world, and work together to completely eliminate colonialism on the earth and strive for lasting peace to the end!

    Comrades, today we are very honored to invite Mr. Brahim Ghafa, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, and Mr. Adef Danil, the representative of the Arab People's Congress, to attend our conference. Please allow me to express a warm welcome to them on behalf of the conference, and through them, pay tribute to the heroic Algerian people and the people of Arab countries!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Arab people!

    Long live the unity of the people of Asian and African countries! (Attached picture)

    六亿人民站在阿尔及利亚一边
    郭沫若在首都各界声援阿尔及利亚人民大会上的讲话亲爱的来宾们，同志们！
    中国首都各界人民声援阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会现在开始了。
    大家知道，今年元旦在开罗闭幕的亚非人民团结大会，反映了亚非人民的共同意志，曾通过了一系列重要决议，对于发扬万隆精神、促进亚非人民团结、争取和维护亚非民族独立以及保卫世界和平事业，作出了重大的贡献。大会表示了坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，并且谴责了法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚的野蛮暴行，一致通过了关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议，号召亚非各国人民于3月30日举行“声援阿尔及利亚日”。为了响应这一庄严的号召，中国亚洲团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中华人民共和国—阿拉伯联合共和国友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国人民对外文化协会等群众团体发起举行首都各界人民声援阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会。今天，参加这个大会的有我国首都的工人、青年、妇女、学生、文化、工商、宗教等各界代表。我们以中国人民的名义在这里向全世界再一次声明：中国人民愿与亚非各国人民一起，和全世界人民一起，坚决支援阿尔及利亚人民反抗法国殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争！
    法帝国主义者对阿尔及利亚的殖民统治已有一百二十八年的历史，在阿尔及利亚进行罪恶的殖民战争已经三年零五个月。然而殖民主义的血腥镇压是吓不倒要求独立、自由与和平的人民的。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民进行了长期的反对法国殖民主义者的艰苦斗争，取得了许多重大的胜利，至今阿尔及利亚广大土地已经获得解放，在许多地区建立了自己的政权。阿尔及利亚人民斗争的胜利给予法国殖民者以沉重的打击，并且鼓舞了全世界各国人民争取自由与和平的信心。我们谨向为祖国的独立自由而英勇战斗的阿尔及利亚人民致以热烈的兄弟的敬礼！我们祝阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争取得彻底的胜利！
    中国人民同阿尔及利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民从很早的时候起就开始了友好往来。长期在帝国主义和殖民主义压迫下的相似处境和各自为争取和维护民族独立而进行的斗争，更加加深了我们之间的同情和关怀。
    我们中国政府和中国人民一贯支持阿尔及利亚人民和阿拉伯人民以及亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的正义事业。早在1956年6月，周恩来总理就曾说过：“在北非，阿尔及利亚人民还在被迫地进行武装抵抗。中国人民支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，同时，对于阿尔及利亚的紧张局势，也不能不深切关怀。”周恩来总理并且指出，应该“在充分承认阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望的基础上，进行和平谈判，恢复阿尔及利亚的和平。”这些话，充分表达了六亿中国人民的共同愿望。我们坚决反对奴役和屠杀别国人民的殖民主义统治和帝国主义侵略。我们严正抗议法国殖民者的暴行，我们要求法国政府立即停止屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的战争！立即释放一切无辜的爱国者！立即承认阿尔及利亚人民独立和自由！
    我们还必须指出，美帝国主义不断地通过贷款和供给军火支持法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的罪行，同样是我们中国人民坚决反对的。我们要警告一切殖民主义者和帝国主义者：如果你们不顾人民的抗议和反对，继续进行殖民战争和血腥统治，必将遭到最彻底的、最可耻的失败。我们坚信：最后胜利必定属于为正义事业而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民！
    我们中国人民将永远同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起，并且愿与亚非各国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民加强团结，共同努力，为在地球上彻底消灭殖民主义，为争取持久和平而奋斗到底！
    各位同志，今天我们非常荣幸地邀请了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表卜拉欣·加法先生和阿拉伯人民大会的代表阿德夫·达尼尔先生出席我们的大会，请允许我代表大会向他们表示热烈的欢迎，并通过他们向英勇的阿尔及利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民致敬！
    中国和阿尔及利亚人民的友谊万岁！
    中国和阿拉伯各国人民的友谊万岁！
    亚非各国人民团结万岁！（附图片）
