Developing Woody Oil Production
--The Most Reliable Way to Increase Oil Production
Liu Kun, Deputy Director of the Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry

As everyone knows, the current oil supply situation in our country is tight. This is mainly because China's population is increasing rapidly, people's living standards are improving, and the demand for edible oil is increasing. At present, the national per capita consumption of edible oil is 5.26 jin, an increase of 23.76% compared with 1953. This level is still low. In the industrial field, all mechanical, chemical, light, and construction industries, as well as the manufacture of vehicles, farm implements, and daily necessities (such as oilcloth, umbrellas, and soap), consume a lot of oil. Due to the shortage of industrial oil, a large amount of edible oil has to be allocated to supply industry every year. For example, in 1954, 46,500 tons were allocated, of which 32,400 tons were used for making soap alone; in 1957, 76,800 tons were allocated. This also increased the contradiction between the supply and demand of edible oil. In addition, some oil materials (such as soybeans, tung oil, and walnuts) cannot meet the needs of export. Therefore, no matter from which point of view, it is urgent to develop oil production.

What is the way to develop oil production? In addition to increasing the yield per unit area of existing herbaceous oil crops, it is necessary to vigorously develop woody oil production. At present, the planting area of herbaceous oil crops in our country has reached more than 110 million mu, accounting for about 5% of the total planting area of national crops. Further expansion will inevitably squeeze grain and cotton. However, developing the production of woody oil crops does not compete with grain and cotton for land, and has the advantages of low investment and high returns. This is currently the most potential way to solve the oil problem.

At present, the output of several major woody oil materials in our country has greatly exceeded the output in the early days of liberation. Among them, the output of tung oil has exceeded the highest level before the Anti-Japanese War. However, the overall production level is still very low, and the potential for increasing the production of woody oil materials has not been fully utilized.

In the future, the development of woody oil production should focus on vigorously reclaiming various oil forests and increasing the yield per unit area, while making full use of all suitable mountainous areas for cultivating woody oil materials, and actively creating new forests.

We should strive to basically reclaim the current 17 million mu of barren oil-tea forests by next year, and increase the average oil yield per mu of existing oil-tea forests from about 11 jin to 15 jin. Experience has proved that barren oil-tea forests can achieve high yields in two or three years after reclamation. Generally, the yield per mu of forest land is 15-20 jin is not a problem; in individual forest lands with good soil quality and advanced management, the yield per mu can reach 100 jin. For example, the Lianji Agricultural Cooperative in Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, has 44 mu of oil-tea forest with a yield of more than 100 jin per mu, of which 5.25 mu produced an average of 150 jin of oil.

In walnut production, the biggest problem is the damage caused by a pest called the walnut curculio. According to statistics from 25 agricultural cooperatives in Ji County, Hebei Province, this pest caused a reduction of 400,000 jin of walnuts. As long as we focus on preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, the walnut yield can be increased by three or four times compared with the present. For example, the yield per walnut tree in the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei Province is generally 40-50 jin; last year, a walnut tree in Yanjia Terrace, Jingxi Mining Area, Beijing, produced more than 1,000 jin of fruit.

In addition, woody oil crops such as tung trees and Chinese tallow trees also need to be properly managed and protected according to the specific conditions of each region.

The planting of new woody oil forests cannot be relaxed either. As of 1956, the country had newly planted more than 13 million mu of oil-tea forests, more than 13 million mu of tung trees, more than 19 million mu of walnut trees, and 1.37 million mu of Chinese tallow trees. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is hoped that 50 million mu of new oil-tea forests, 15 million mu of tung trees, and 4.5 million mu of Chinese tallow trees can be planted. 1 billion walnut trees should be newly planted in the next ten years.

After completing the above figures, our country will have more than 96 million mu of oil-tea forests and 1.1 billion walnut trees. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan period, it will be able to supply 250,000 tons of tea oil, 250,000 tons of tung oil, and 70,000 tons of tallow oil; the output of walnuts will also be greatly increased. At that time, the oil supply situation in our country will be greatly improved.

The development of woody oil crops production is to be undertaken by agricultural and forestry cooperatives in mountainous areas. It is understood that some oil-tea trees and walnut trees have not yet joined the cooperatives. According to the advanced cooperative model regulations and the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on implementing the mutual benefit policy within agricultural cooperatives, we should actively handle the issue of oil-tea forests joining the cooperatives. The methods of joining the cooperatives can be roughly divided into two types: one is to evaluate the price and return the money in installments; the other is to determine the proportion and distribute the profits year by year (it is better to distribute the profits at a fixed proportion). As for the level of the profit sharing ratio, it should be determined separately according to the annual output, the age and strength of the trees, the distance, the difficulty of management, and the economic situation of the cooperative, so that the forest owners can get reasonable compensation, and the members can get appropriate labor remuneration.

Most of the woody oil production areas are mountainous areas, and most of them are old revolutionary base areas, with a shortage of labor and weak economic strength. On the other hand, reclaiming barren tea forests is heavy physical labor, and there is no income in the current year. Therefore, it is necessary for the state to provide appropriate loans within the possible scope. The prevention and control of walnut curculio pests requires some medicines and equipment, such as wettable 666 and sprayers. At present, the supply of medicines and equipment is tight, and relevant departments should give strong support according to needs and possibilities.

The main measures for increasing production are reclamation, loosening the soil, and weeding for oil-tea, and digging tree platforms for walnuts. However, in these operations, we must pay attention to mountain digging techniques, otherwise it will cause soil erosion, exposed roots, resulting in reduced oil production, and will directly harm agricultural production. Therefore, we must decide on the method of digging mountains according to the size of the slope of the mountain. Generally, full reclamation can be carried out for slopes below 15 degrees; for 15-25 degrees, it is best to adopt contour strip reclamation; for about 30 degrees, hole reclamation is appropriate; for more than 35 degrees, only grass should be cut, and mountain digging should not be carried out.

Selecting and promoting fine varieties is very important to ensure the increased production of oil-tea and walnuts. At present, there are many varieties of oil-tea, and it is difficult to determine which one is the best. Various places can focus on testing and organize the masses to observe and select on the spot. The better varieties of walnuts include thin-shelled walnuts, exposed-kernel walnuts, and cotton walnuts. For these excellent seeds, relevant departments should sign pre-purchase contracts with agricultural and forestry cooperatives, and guide the selection, single storage, and packaging, all for seed use.

It is hoped that leading organs at all levels will attach importance to the development of woody oil materials, a task that is related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and incorporate it into the leadership agenda, coordinate agricultural and forestry production, and make it develop faster.

    发展木本油料生产
    ——增产油料最可靠的途径
    林业部造林局副局长　刘琨
    谁都知道，目前我国油料供应状况是紧张的。这主要是因为我国人口增加快，人民生活水平提高，食油需要量增大。现在全国每人食油消耗量为五点二六斤，比1953年提高23.76％。这个水平仍然是低的。在工业方面，一切机械工业、化学工业、轻工业、建筑业，舟车、农具和日用品（如油布、雨伞、肥皂）的制造，都耗费很多油料。由于工业用油不足，每年还得调拨大量食用油供应工业。如1954年就调用了四万六千五百吨，其中仅用于制肥皂的即达三万二千四百吨；1957年也调用了七万六千八百吨。这也增加了食用油供求之间的矛盾。此外，有些油料（如大豆、桐油、核桃）也不能满足出口的需要。因此，不论从哪方面说，都迫切需要发展油料生产。
    发展油料生产的途径何在呢？除了提高现有草本油料作物的单位面积产量外，就是大力发展木本油料生产。目前我国草本油料播种面积已达一亿一千多万亩，占全国农作物总播种面积的5％左右，再扩大，势必挤了粮棉。而发展木本油料作物生产，既不与粮棉争地，而且投资少，收益大。这是当前解决油料问题潜力最大的办法。
    现在我国几种主要木本油料的产量都已大大超过解放初期的产量，其中，桐油产量已超过抗日战争前最高水平。但是，总的生产水平还很低，增产木本油料的潜力还没有充分利用。
    今后发展木本油料生产，应该以大力垦复各种油料林，提高单位面积产量为主，同时充分利用一切适宜培植木本油料的山地，积极营造新林。
    我们应该争取明年将现在荒芜的一千七百万亩油茶林基本垦复完毕，并且把现有油茶林每亩平均产油量由十一斤左右提高到十五斤。经验证明，荒芜的油茶林一经垦复，两三年后即能丰产。一般的林地亩产十五——二十斤是没有问题的；个别土质好，经营先进的林地，每亩产量可达一百斤。如浙江丽水县联济农业社有四十四亩油茶林每亩产量就达到一百斤以上，其中五点二五亩平均产油一百五十斤。
    在核桃生产上，最大问题是一种名叫核桃黑的害虫的为害。据河北省蓟县二十五个农业社的统计，由于这种虫害而减产核桃四十万斤。只要抓紧防除病虫害，核桃产量即可比现在提高三、四倍。如河北省石家庄专区核桃树单株产量一般是四十——五十斤；北京市京西矿区燕家台一株核桃去年产果一千余斤。
    此外，油桐、乌桕等木本油料作物，也都需要根据各地具体情况做好垦复和保护经营管理工作。
    新造木本油料林，也不能放松。截至1956年，全国新造油茶林一千三百余万亩、油桐一千三百余万亩、核桃一千九百万亩、乌桕一百三十七万亩。第二个五年计划期间，希望能争取新造油茶林五千万亩、油桐一千五百万亩、乌桕四百五十万亩。核桃在今后十年应新植十亿株。
    完成了上面几个数字，我国将有油茶林九千六百余万亩、核桃十一亿株。第二个五年计划期末年，将可供应茶油二十五万吨、桐油二十五万吨、桕油七万吨；核桃产量也将大大增加。那时，我国油料供应状况将有很大改善。
    发展木本油料作物生产，是要由山区农林业合作社来担负的。据了解，现在还有一部分油茶树和核桃树没有入社。应该根据高级社示范章程和中共中央关于在农业合作社内部贯彻互利政策的指示，积极处理油茶林的入社问题。入社办法大体上可分两种：一是作价归社，分期还款；一是确定比例，逐年分益（以固定比例分益为好）。至于分益比例的高低，应根据常年产量、树龄老壮、路途远近、管理难易以及合作社的经济情况等分别确定，既要使林主得到合理代价，又要使社员能得到适当的劳动报酬。
    木本油料产区多半是山区，又多是革命老根据地，劳力缺乏，经济力量也不强。另一方面，垦复荒芜茶林是重体力劳动，当年又无收益。因此国家在可能范围内给予适当的贷款是必要的。防治核桃黑虫害，需要有一些药械，如可湿性六六六和喷雾器等。目前药械供应紧张，有关部门应当根据需要和可能，给以大力支援。
    油茶的垦复、松土、除草，核桃的刨树坪等，都是增产的主要措施。但是在这些作业当中，必须注意挖山技术，否则会造成土壤冲刷，根部裸露，造成油料减产，还会直接危害农田生产。因此，必须根据山的坡度大小来决定挖山的办法，一般坡度在十五度以下的可以全垦；十五——二十五度的最好采取等高带状条垦的办法，三十度左右以穴垦为宜，超过三十五度的，只宜割草，不宜挖山。
    选种和推广良种，对于保证油茶、核桃增产十分重要。目前油茶品种很多，哪种最好，尚难肯定，各地可重点试验，组织群众到现场观察和采选。核桃中比较优良的品种有薄壳核桃、露仁核桃、绵核桃等。对于这些优良种子，应通过有关部门与农林业合作社订立预购合同，并指导采选，单藏，包装全部作为种用。
    希望各级领导机关重视发展木本油料这一关系国计民生的任务，把它纳入领导日程，统筹安排农、林生产，使它更快地发展。
