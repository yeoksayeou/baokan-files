Xinhua News Agency, March 25th Dispatch from Washington: The Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), with 16 million members, issued a statement on the 24th, saying that various economic indicators show that the U.S. "economic situation continues to deteriorate."

The statement, issued after the Executive Committee held a full-day meeting in Washington, expressed great concern about the rapid development of the U.S. economic recession. The statement said that in February, the number of unemployed in the United States had reached 5,173,000, the highest peak in sixteen years, and the trend since February indicates that the number of unemployed is even higher than the previous month. The statement pointed out that the current U.S. capacity to manufacture goods and provide services has exceeded national purchasing power, and the expected expenditure for building new factories and adding new equipment has decreased by 13%. At the same time, consumers are becoming increasingly unwilling to buy things.

The Executive Committee called on the U.S. government to take measures to "help end" the economic recession. The solutions it proposed are: tax cuts of 6 billion to 8 billion U.S. dollars; increasing unemployment and social insurance relief; raising the minimum wage; accelerating public works programs and aiding depressed areas, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, March 25th Dispatch from TASS, New York, March 24th: Due to the U.S. economic recession, the economic and political difficulties of Latin American countries are deepening.

"New York Times" reporter Schulze, who has traveled extensively in Latin American countries, pointed out that the economic situation of Latin American countries, especially the foreign exchange situation, is being adversely affected by the U.S. economic recession because the U.S. economic recession has caused "the decline in prices of agricultural and mineral products and the reduction in commodity exports" of Latin American countries. The reporter wrote: "Observers worry that strong anti-American sentiment may sweep across South America."

"New York Herald Tribune" reporter Newman, in a dispatch from Buenos Aires, said that the U.S. economic recession "has impacted the economies of many Latin American countries, especially Brazil and Chile... Chile has once again seen ragged, homeless unemployed people wandering the streets. Because the United States needs less copper, the price of copper has plummeted. This has hit the economic foundation of Chile, because Chile mainly relies on selling copper to obtain U.S. dollars. The same is true for Brazilian coffee. Here again, people are discussing burning coffee."

Newman pointed out that the U.S. recession has caused a shrinking sales market for Latin America's main exports, thereby deepening the economic crisis in many Latin American countries. He pointed out that Chile's inflation is growing rapidly. Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Uruguay "are also caught in the vortex of inflation. Argentina is not far from these countries." Newman emphasized: "If the recession in North America deepens, inflation in Latin America will obviously become even more acute."

    “劳联—产联”发出警报
    美国经济情况继续恶化
    拉丁美洲遭到美国萧条风的冲击
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：拥有一千六百万会员的美国“劳工联合会—产业工会联合会”的执行委员会24日发表声明说，各种经济指标表明美国“经济情况继续恶化”。
    这个声明是执行委员会在华盛顿举行了整整一天的会议后发表的，它对美国经济衰退的迅速发展表示非常忧虑。声明说，在2月份，美国失业人数已经达到五百一十七万三千人，这是十六年来的最高峰，而2月份以后的趋势表明，失业人数比前一个月还要多。声明指出，目前美国全国制造商品和提供劳务的能力已经超过全国的购买力，预期用于建造新工厂和增加新设备的费用下降了13％。同时，消费者已经越来越不愿买东西了。
    执行委员会要求美国政府采取措施来“帮助结束”经济衰退。它提出的办法是：减税六十亿到八十亿美元；增加失业和社会保险救济金；提高最低工资；加速公共工程计划和援助陷入萧条的地区等等。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社纽约24日讯：由于美国的经济衰退，拉丁美洲各国的经济困难和政治困难正在加深。
    曾经在拉丁美洲各国作了长期旅行的“纽约时报”记者舒尔次指出，拉丁美洲国家的经济状况，特别是外汇状况，正在受到美国经济衰退的不利影响，因为美国经济衰退引起拉丁美洲国家“农产品和矿产品价格的下跌和商品输出的减少”。记者写道：“观察家们耽心强烈的反美情绪可能席卷整个南美。”
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者纽曼从布宜诺斯艾利斯发出的消息说，美国的经济衰退“冲击了拉丁美洲很多国家的经济，特别是巴西和智利的经济……智利又出现了衣衫褴褛、流浪街头的失业者。由于美国需要的铜的数量减少，铜价猛跌。这就打击了智利的经济基础，因为智利主要是靠出售铜而获得美元的。巴西的咖啡也是这样。这里又有人议论要焚毁咖啡了。”
    纽曼指出，美国的衰退造成拉丁美洲主要输出品销售市场的缩小，从而加深拉丁美洲很多国家的经济危机。他指出，智利的通货膨胀正在迅速增长。巴西、秘鲁、玻利维亚和乌拉圭“也卷入了通货膨胀的漩涡。阿根廷也同这些国家相差不远。”纽曼强调：“如果北美的衰退加深，拉丁美洲的通货膨胀显然一定会更加尖锐。”
