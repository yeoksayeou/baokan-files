    Making Trouble Out of Nothing
    The U.S. State Department announced that on March 6th, the United States presented a note to the Soviet Union, "protesting" the Soviet government's decision announced on July 21st of last year declaring Peter the Great Bay to be Soviet internal waters. The note insisted that the Soviet decision "undermined the basic principles of international law," and threatened that "the act of seizing this part of the high seas is of concern to the whole world…"
    However, people know that what the whole world is currently concerned about is the U.S. decision to begin nuclear weapons testing on Eniwetok Island in the Pacific in April, a decision that has aroused protests from people all over the world. The Pacific Ocean is the high seas, and the U.S. testing of nuclear weapons in the Pacific is an act that undermines international law and infringes upon the freedom of the high seas. Disregarding the protests of people all over the world, the United States is instead "protesting" the Soviet Union's decision, based on customary international law, to reaffirm what the Tsarist government had declared as early as 1901, that Peter the Great Bay is an internal sea, and is shamelessly interfering in Soviet territorial sovereignty. This is clearly an attempt to divert people's anger towards the United States.
    However, this kind of unreasonable and troublesome behavior is too clumsy.

    无理取闹
    美国国务院宣布：美国在3月6日向苏联提出照会，“抗议”苏联政府去年7月21日宣布的关于大彼得湾为苏联内海的决定，照会中硬说苏联的决定“破坏了国际法的基本原则”，并威胁说，“侵占这片公海的行动，是全世界都关心的……”。
    然而，人们知道，全世界目前所关心的是美国预定4月开始在太平洋恩纳威托克岛举行核武器试验的决定，这个决定已引起了全世界人民的抗议。太平洋是公海，美国在太平洋上试验核武器才是破坏国际法、侵犯公海自由的行动。美国不顾全世界人民的抗议，反而对苏联根据国际法惯例，重申早在1901年沙皇政府就宣布过的大彼得湾为内海的决定提出“抗议”，对苏联领海主权进行无耻干涉，这显然是企图转移人们对美国的愤怒情绪。
    但是，这种无理取闹的做法，未免太拙劣了。
