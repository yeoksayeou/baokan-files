Editorial:

    The recent National Conference of Socialist Construction Activists of State-Owned Farms and Ranches, convened by the Ministry of Land Reclamation, was a mass meeting characterized by fierce struggle between progressive and conservative ideologies. Serious conservative thinking within the land reclamation system has been strongly challenged. After many people enhanced their understanding and confidence, the various targets for 1958 and the Second Five-Year Plan have leaped forward significantly: the land reclamation target for 1958 has leaped from the original plan of 7 million mu to 15 million mu; the total grain output has leaped from the original plan of 2.3 billion jin to more than 3 billion jin (excluding various economic crops); and the land reclamation target for the Second Five-Year Plan has also leaped from the original plan of 60 million mu to 82 million mu. The investment quota for land reclamation and farm construction has been greatly reduced, generally from more than 70 yuan or more than 30 yuan to about 20 yuan.

    In order to increase the speed of land reclamation, farm construction, and production development, the conference determined the principles of "fixed investment, completion within a limited time" and "reclaiming land, producing, constructing, accumulating, and expanding simultaneously," abandoning the mechanical procedure of first constructing and then producing. At the same time, it was decided to implement the policy of "integrating agriculture and animal husbandry with processing industries, and diversifying operations," so that various operations within the enterprise can support each other, resist natural disasters, promote each other, and accelerate the development of production. It also requires that each unit area produce a variety of products, each product should strive to be processed as much as possible, and each agricultural worker should engage in a variety of jobs. This will overcome the waste of land, equipment, manpower, and animal power, thereby reducing costs.

    In order to implement the policies decided by the conference, we believe that the key issue is to continue to eliminate conservative thinking. Judging from the progress of this conference, conservative thinking in the land reclamation system needs to be eradicated in the following aspects:

    The first issue is the guiding ideology for the development of land reclamation. There have always been two opposing guiding ideologies on how to develop land reclamation. One guiding ideology advocates using the spirit of hard struggle, using very little money to reclaim more wasteland and build more farms, so as to increase more wealth for the country. The other guiding ideology advocates doing less and on a smaller scale, supposedly only in this way can things be done well. These two ideologies have engaged in fierce struggles in various aspects. Now, after the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the truth has become clear, and everyone can see that the former ideology is in line with the "more, faster, better, and more economical" policy, while the latter ideology violates this policy. After actual inspection at the conference, it was proven that the latter ideology caused huge damage to the land reclamation cause in 1957; it was also proven that the so-called "doing well" under the premise of "doing less and on a smaller scale" is actually empty talk. In the future, this ideology of building farms and producing more, faster, better, and more economically must be quickly implemented in every farm and ranch and among all their staff, so that everyone understands that the law of objective things is to achieve a qualitative leap in the development of quantity; the "good" required for building socialism is good that is more, faster, and more economical; the construction of socialist agriculture can never rely on a few farms that are small and few in number. Just imagine, if we always delay our progress and always do little and on a small scale, how many centuries will it take to build socialist agriculture? Continuing in this way can only be considered a bad thing, so what good is there?

    The second issue is the attitude towards difficulties. In recent years, many state-owned farms and ranches have encountered many difficulties. In the face of difficulties, there are two different attitudes. One attitude is to shout about difficulties and abandon land and farms and shrink operations when they are losing money; the other attitude is to learn from failures, improve work, and continue to develop production. The result of the former attitude is that the operation shrinks and the farm still loses money; the result of the latter attitude is that the operation expands and turns into a profit. All farms and ranches should learn from this lesson from now on, that is, when a career encounters difficulties, one should never lose the courage to move forward and retreat passively; instead, one should bite the bullet, take resolute measures to overcome difficulties, and actively move forward. Whoever can do this will enable the land reclamation cause to develop. Conversely, it will cause the cause to regress.

    The third issue is whether things can be done with less money. After the targets were raised, some people hoped to add money accordingly, believing that "things cannot be done with less money." This idea must be thoroughly criticized. More money certainly makes it easier to do things, but our basic situation today is that there are many things to do but little money, which is a basic contradiction in the process of socialist construction. The only way to solve this contradiction is to save money. We should not only believe in the role of money, but should pay more attention to the role of people. As long as we can highly exert people's subjective initiative, then even with less money, we can do many things and do them well. The mechanical "money is everything" theory is completely wrong. Many reports at the conference have illustrated this point. These good examples should become common learning materials for farms and ranches in various regions.

    The fourth issue is whether a leap forward can be achieved if objective conditions are not good. At the meeting, some people emphasized that the objective conditions of their farms were not good and they could not achieve a leap forward. This argument is also wrong. We admit that the quality of objective conditions has an impact on work, but we also believe that objective conditions are only of relative significance. There are many farms with completely identical objective conditions, but their production performance varies greatly, which shows that the decisive factor is not objective conditions, but subjective conditions. Because objective conditions can be changed through subjective efforts. For example, if the soil quality is not good, people can transform the soil. If the water conservancy conditions are not good, people can build water conservancy projects. If the climate is not good, people can think of ways to improve crop varieties and cultivation methods. In recent years, due to the superiority of our social system and political system, objective natural conditions that have been considered unchangeable for thousands of years have been rapidly changed in a short period of time. The idea of "relying on the heavens for food" is a product of the backward small-scale peasant economy and must be thoroughly eliminated in socialist China today. The state-owned farms in the Qinghai area are located at an altitude of more than 2,700 meters, with a frost-free period of only 80 to 90 days, and because the climate is constantly changing, there is no absolute frost-free period. However, the wheat yield there in 1957 was an average of more than 500 jin per mu, and some large-scale high-yield fields reached 1,000 jin. It can be seen that the mechanical "objective conditions theory" is untenable.

    In the nationwide vigorous anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, every farm and ranch worker should repeatedly examine their own thinking and clean up every conservative view hiding in the corners. This is the guarantee for the great leap forward of the land reclamation cause. We wish the national state-owned farms and ranches great victories in 1958 and during the Second Five-Year Plan.

### 扫清国营农场中的保守思想

    扫清国营农场中的保守思想
    农垦部最近召开的全国国营农牧场社会主义建设积极分子会议，是一次群众性的前进思想和保守思想激烈斗争的会议。农垦工作系统中的一些严重的保守思想，受到了猛烈的冲击；在很多人提高认识和信心以后，1958年和第二个五年计划的各项指标，都得到了大步的跃进：1958年的开荒指标，由原计划的七百万亩跃进到了一千五百万亩；粮食总产量由原计划的二十三亿斤跃进到了三十多亿斤（各种经济作物除外）；第二个五年计划的开荒指标，也由原计划的六千万亩跃进到了八千二百万亩。开荒建场的投资定额，则大大降低，一般的都由七十几元、三十几元，降低到了二十元左右。
    为了提高开荒建场和发展生产的速度，会议确定了“定额投资，限期完成”、“边开荒、边生产、边建设、边积累、边扩大”的原则，抛弃了过去那种先建设好再搞生产的机械的程序。同时决定实行“农牧业和加工业互相结合，多种经营”的方针，使企业内部各种经营能互相支援，抵御自然灾害的袭击，互相促进，加速生产的发展。还要求在每一单位面积上，生产多种产品，每一产品尽量争取加工，每一农业工人兼做多样工种。这样就可以克服土地、设备、人力、畜力各方面的浪费现象，从而降低成本。
    为了贯彻执行会议所决定的方针，我们认为关键问题是继续清除保守思想。从此次会议的进程看，农垦系统的保守思想需要从以下几个问题上根除。
    第一个问题，是农垦事业发展的指导思想问题。在农垦事业如何发展的问题上一直存在着两个对立的指导思想。一个指导思想是主张以艰苦奋斗的精神，用很少的钱，开更多的荒，建更多的场，为国家增殖更多的财富。另一个指导思想则是主张少办，小办，据说只有这样才能办好。这两个思想曾经在各方面进行过激烈的斗争。现在经过全民整风与反浪费反保守运动，真理已经大白，每一个人都看清楚了前一种思想是符合于“多快好省”方针的，而后一种思想是违反这个方针的。会议中经过实际的检查，证明后一种思想给1957年的垦荒事业造成了巨大的损害；也证明在“少办、小办”前提下的所谓“办好”，实际上是空话。今后，这种多快好省地建场和生产的思想必须迅速地贯彻到每一个农牧场和它们的每一个工作人员中去，使大家明白，客观事物的规律，是在量的发展中达到质的跃进；建设社会主义所需要的好，是又多又快又省的好；社会主义农业的建成，决不能依靠又少、又小的几个农场。试想，如果我们老是迟迟不进，老是既办得少，又办得小，那么社会主义农业要拖到几百年才能建成呢？这样拖下去当然只能算坏事，还有什么好呢？
    第二个问题，是对待困难的态度问题。几年来，许多国营农牧场遭遇过不少的困难。在困难面前，有两种不同的态度。一种态度是经营赔钱时就喊叫困难，撩荒撩场，进行收缩；一种态度是从失败中总结经验教训，改进工作，继续发展生产。前一种态度的结果，是经营缩小了，场子仍然赔钱；后一种态度的结果，是经营扩大，转为盈利。所有的农牧场都应当从此取得教训，就是当事业遇到困难的时候，决不应当失掉前进的勇气，消极退却；而应当硬着头皮顶，采取坚决措施打破困难，积极前进。谁能够这样做，谁就会使农垦事业得到发展。反之，就会使事业后退。
    第三个问题，是钱少能不能办事的问题。有一些人在指标提高以后，就希望相应地加钱，认为“钱少办不了事”。这想法必须彻底批判。钱多固然比较容易办事，但我们今天的基本情况是事多钱少，这是社会主义建设过程中的一种基本矛盾。解决这个矛盾的唯一办法，就是节约。我们不应当只相信钱的作用，而应当更重视人的作用。只要能够高度发挥人的能动性，那么即使钱少，也可以办很多的事，并且办好。机械的“唯钱论”是完全不对的。会议上的许多报告都说明了这个道理，这些好的事例，应当成为各地农牧场普遍的学习材料。
    第四个问题，是客观条件不好能不能跃进的问题。会议上有人强调自己场子客观条件不好，不能跃进。这种论点，也是不对的。我们承认客观条件的好坏对工作有影响，但我们同时也认定客观条件只有相对的意义。有许多客观条件完全相同的农场，生产成绩相差很远，这就说明有决定意义的因素不是客观条件，而是主观条件。因为客观条件是可以经过主观努力来改变的。例如土质不好，人们可以改造土壤。水利条件不好，人们可以兴修水利。气候不好，人们可以从作物品种和耕作方法等方面想办法。几年以来，由于我们的社会制度和政治制度的优越，使得几千年来一直被认为不可改变的客观自然条件，都在很短时期内迅速改变了。“靠天吃饭”的思想，是落后的小农经济的产物，在社会主义的今天必须彻底扫除。青海地区的国营农场，海拔在两千七百公尺以上，无霜期只有八、九十天，而且由于气候变化无常，也说不上绝对的无霜期，而那里1957年的小麦产量是平均每亩五百多斤，有的大片丰产田达到一千斤。可见机械的“客观条件论”是站不住脚的。
    在全民性的轰轰烈烈的反浪费反保守运动中，每一个农牧场工作者都应当对自己的思想进行反复检查，把每一点躲在角落里的保守观点都打扫干净。这是农垦事业大跃进的保证。我们预祝全国国营农牧场在1958年和第二个五年计划期间取得伟大的胜利。
