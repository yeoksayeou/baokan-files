    Chengjiang Eliminates Tartary Buckwheat Seed Potatoes

    (Reported by this newspaper) Chengjiang County, Yunnan Province, has completely eliminated Tartary buckwheat and switched to planting potatoes, aiming to achieve a grain yield of 1,130 jin per mu throughout the county.

    Tartary buckwheat was the main grain crop in the mountainous agricultural cooperatives of the county, but the harvest was extremely low, generally yielding only 30 to 50 jin per mu in normal years, and only over 100 jin per mu in exceptionally good harvest years. By switching to potatoes, it is estimated that 3,000 jin per mu can be confidently harvested. This single measure will increase the county's grain production by more than 10 million jin.

    澄江消灭苦荞种薯类
    本报讯　云南省澄江县彻底消灭苦荞改种薯类，要使全县粮食亩产一千一百三十斤。
    苦荞是该县山区农业社的主要粮食作物，但收获量极低，一般年景每亩收入三、五十斤，特大的丰收年，每亩也只有一百多斤。改种薯类，估计每亩有把握收到三千斤。仅此一项，全县即可增产粮食一千多万斤。
