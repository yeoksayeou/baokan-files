    Prospects for Economic Development in Poland
    Progress in Comparison
    Poland's economic construction has made great achievements in the thirteen years since liberation. Especially in industry, the average per capita output of eight major industrial products in 1957 increased more than double to more than two hundred times compared with the pre-war year of 1937. Comparing with some major European capitalist countries, we can see the great progress of Poland's economy in the era of people's power. As can be seen from the chart on the left, Poland's coal production in 1957 averaged 3,302 kilograms per person, while in France that year it averaged around 1,300 kilograms per person, and in Italy only around 22 kilograms per person. In 1957, Poland's steel production averaged 185 kilograms per person, less than France (averaging around 300 kilograms per person), but more than Italy (averaging around 140 kilograms per person).
    The speed of Poland's economic development will continue to increase in the future. On the one hand, Poland has good natural conditions: fertile land, many forests, and abundant mineral resources. It is estimated that coal reserves alone amount to about 70 billion tons (exploration quantity within a depth range of one kilometer), and the population increases by 19 per thousand annually, guaranteeing both human and material resources. On the other hand, the Polish United Workers' Party and the government are taking measures to further improve the management of industrial enterprises, improve labor organization, and strengthen economic cooperation with socialist countries, creating conditions for accelerating the development of the national economy.
    This Year's National Economic Plan
    The main purpose of Poland's 1958 National Economic Plan is to promote the further development of the national economy. The main contents of the plan are: to increase national income, increase industrial and agricultural output, increase employment, improve labor productivity, and reduce production costs.
    According to this year's state plan, the total national income will reach 311.6 billion zlotys (Polish currency), 104.2% of 1957; the reserve amount will be 64.2 billion zlotys, 95.1% of 1957; and state investment will be 49.1 billion zlotys, 108.6% of 1957. This year, the total industrial output value will be 106.9% of 1957, of which the output value of means of production will be 105.5% of last year, and the output value of consumer goods will be 108.4% of last year. This year's total agricultural output value is planned to be 103.9% of 1957, of which the output value of crops will be 103.1% of last year, and the output value of livestock products will be 105.6% of last year.
    The growth of production and consumption is of course closely related to the growth of employment and income. This year, the plan is to add 210,000 new workers in state-owned enterprises. Both national income and national expenditures have increased compared to 1957.
    According to this year's plan, industrial labor productivity will increase by 3.4%, while production costs and market prices will also be reduced separately.
    By 1960
    Poland is implementing the third annual plan of the Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). The implementation of this Five-Year Plan will further develop Poland's national economy and further improve the people's living standards. According to figures from the Polish State Planning Commission, compared with 1955, by 1960, steel production will increase by 58%, electricity by 59.4%, coal by 11.1%, sulfuric acid by 60.7%, machine manufacturing by 54.9%, cement by 80.3%, textiles by 23%, and sugar by 27.5%.

    波兰经济发展的前景
    从比较看进展
    波兰的经济建设在解放后的十三年中已经取得了很大的成就。特别是工业方面，按人口平均的八种主要工业产品产量，1957年比战前1937年都增长了一倍多到二百多倍。同欧洲的一些资本主义大国比较，更可以看出在人民政权时代波兰经济的巨大进展。从左边图表中可以看到，1957年波兰的煤产量平均每人为三千三百零二公斤，而这一年法国每人合一千三百公斤左右，意大利每人才合二十二公斤左右。1957年，波兰钢产量平均每人一百八十五公斤，不及法国（每人平均为三百公斤左右），但超过意大利（每人平均为一百四十公斤左右）。
    波兰经济发展的速度在今后还会有增无已。这一方面是因为波兰有良好的自然条件：土地肥沃，森林很多，各种矿产资源丰富。据估计，仅煤储量就有七百亿吨左右（深度范围为一公里的勘探数量），而且人口年增千分之十九，人力物力都有保证。一方面是波兰统一工人党和政府正在采取措施，进一步改进工业企业的管理，改进劳动组织，同时并加强同社会主义国家的经济合作，为加速国民经济的发展而创造条件。
    今年的国民经济计划
    波兰的1958年国民经济计划，主要目的在于促使国家经济的进一步发展。计划主要内容是：增加国民收入，增加工农业产量，增加就业人数，提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本。
    根据今年国家计划，全部国民收入要达到三千一百一十六亿兹罗提（波币名），为1957年的104.2％；储备金额为六百四十二亿兹罗提，为1957年的95.1％；国家投资为四百九十一亿兹罗提，为1957年的108.6％。今年工业总产值将为1957年的106.9％，其中生产资料的产值为去年的105.5％，消费资料的产值为去年的108.4％。今年农业总产值计划为1957年的103.9％，其中农作物产值为去年的103.1％，畜产品产值为去年的105.6％。
    生产和消费的增长，当然同就业人数和收入的增长密切联系着。今年计划在国营企业增加二十一万新工人。国民收入和国家的支出都比1957年有所增加。
    根据今年计划，工业劳动生产率将提高3.4％，同时生产成本和市场价格也将分别降低。
    到1960年
    波兰正在执行五年计划（1956—1960年）的第三个年度计划，实现这一个五年计划，就会使波兰的国民经济取得进一步的发展，人民生活水平可以进一步提高。根据波兰国家计划委员会数字，同1955年比较，到1960年的时候，钢产量将提高58％，电力59.4％，煤11.1％，硫酸60.7％，机器制造54.9％，水泥80.3％，纺织品23％，糖27.5％。
