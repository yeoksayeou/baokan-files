Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 1st: The first phase of the main construction of Zhanjiang Port, our country’s first modern commercial port planned, designed, and constructed independently, has recently been completed.

Now, the deep-water and intermediate docks of this port, which can simultaneously berth three 10,000-ton ocean-going vessels and two 5,000-ton ships, have been put into use. The trestle-type oil dock, capable of berthing 25,000-ton oil tankers, will also be put into use. The giant automated gantry cranes arranged on the docks can quickly lift goods from the ships directly into the railway carriages, or lift materials from the trains into the ship's holds. There are railway networks and wide operating yards between the docks and warehouses. The loading and unloading work has fully utilized universal forklifts and various loading and unloading transportation machines.

    深水、中级码头启用，同时可停五艘巨轮
    据新华社广州1日电　我国第一个由自己规划、设计和施工的现代化的大商港——湛江港的第一期主要工程已在最近完成。
    现在，这个港口可以同时停靠三艘万吨远洋巨轮和两艘五千吨轮船的深水码头和中级码头，都已交付使用。可以停靠两万五千吨油船的突堤式油码头，也将交付使用。码头上排列着的巨型自动化龙门式起重机，可以迅速地把轮船上的货物直接吊运到火车厢里，或者把火车上的物资吊入轮船货仓。码头与仓库之间有铁路网和宽广的操作场。装卸工作已充分使用了万能装卸车和各种装卸运输机器。
