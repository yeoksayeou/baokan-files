Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, March 15th: The Fuxin Coal Mine has once again revised its great leap forward targets, raising this year's coal production plan to 11 million tons, striving to complete 12 million tons, and catching up with the new leap forward plan proposed by the Fushun Coal Mine. This new target was put forward at the Fuxin City's Second Industrial Three-Level Cadre Conference.

The mine originally proposed a plan of 9.35 million tons of coal, which was subsequently broken through four times in the process of employee discussions, and finally a goal of producing 10 million tons of coal annually was proposed, to learn from the coal capital, Fushun. After the Fushun Coal Mine put forward a great leap forward plan to produce 11 million tons of coal annually, it promoted the further development of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement of the Fuxin miners. They are determined to raise their great leap forward plan again and catch up with Fushun.

Currently, the Fuxin mining area is boiling with the fervor of the great leap forward. Various mines have held on-site meetings and various experience exchange meetings one after another. Many miners and technicians, after getting off work, do not bother to rest, and crowd together to study new production experiences and new working methods. In order to strive to hand over 12 million tons of coal to the state this year, all employees of the mining area have been mobilized.

    阜新再改指标
    争取赶过抚顺
    新华社阜新15日电　阜新煤矿又一次修改了自己的跃进指标，把今年煤的生产计划提高到一千一百万吨，争取完成一千二百万吨，赶上了抚顺煤矿新提出的跃进计划。这个新指标是在阜新市第二次工业三级干部会议上提出来的。
    这个矿区原来提出的计划是九百三十五万吨煤，后来在职工讨论的过程中一连被突破四次，最后提出年产一千万吨煤的奋斗目标，向煤都抚顺看齐。抚顺煤矿提出了年产一千一百万吨煤的跃进计划后，促进了阜新矿工的反浪费反保守运动的进一步开展。他们决心再次提高自己的跃进计划，赶上抚顺。
    现在，阜新矿区到处沸腾着跃进的热潮。各个矿山接二连三地举行现场会议和各种经验交流会议，很多矿工和技术人员下班后都顾不得休息，就挤在一起研究新的生产经验和新的工作方法。为了争取今年交给国家一千二百万吨煤炭，全矿区的职工都动员了起来。
