Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, March 7th: According to a report in the "Yangon Daily" on the 6th, the Burmese government has decided to send representatives to hold talks with representatives of the Burmese Communist Party. The newspaper said that the talks might be held in four or five days.

The "Yangon Daily" pointed out that Burmese Communist leader Thakin Than Tun sent two envoys a few days ago to bring suggestions for achieving domestic peace to Prime Minister U Nu. They had held talks separately with a member of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Executive Committee and a member of the Domestic Peace Committee.

The newspaper said that Thakin Than Tun's suggestions had been submitted to the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Executive Committee for discussion. Some of the basic principles on which these suggestions were based had been accepted. The government has agreed to select two senior leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League to hold talks with representatives of the Burmese Communist Party. The newspaper also said that the Burmese Communist envoys' request for a government guarantee of safe passage had been accepted.

According to another report in the "Burma New Light of Asia," Burmese Communist leader Thakin Than Tun wrote a letter to Prime Minister U Nu on March 3, suggesting that both sides cease fire on the tenth anniversary of the civil war, i.e., March 28th of this year. The letter also put forward the following five demands: that neither side should pursue past actions; that those who restore their legal status should not be persecuted or suppressed; that all repressive laws should be abolished; that all political prisoners should be released; and that the Burmese Communist Party and all other political parties and groups deprived of their legal rights should be legally recognized. The letter also said that if the government agreed, representatives of the Burmese Communist Party would arrive in Rangoon before March 27.
