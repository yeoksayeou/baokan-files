Gaoxian Invests 300 Yuan to Build Copper Plant in One Month
Ping Shan Longhua Copper Plant Spends 25,000 Yuan, Sees No Copper After More Than Half a Year

(Our newspaper reports) According to the Sichuan Daily, Gaoxian County built a new copper plant this year, spending only 300 yuan, and put it into production in less than a month. It recovered the entire investment in less than ten days after production began. The plant plans to produce 300 tons of copper this year.

The copper smelting method created by the Gaoxian Copper Plant has five major characteristics: (1) Continuous charging and continuous copper output (copper smelting in other parts of Sichuan stops firing after each copper output); (2) Copper can also be smelted with cold air (the air blown into the furnace by the bellows is not heat-treated to become hot air); (3) Lan charcoal can also be used for copper smelting (Lan charcoal is a type of charcoal inferior to coke; the Gaoxian Copper Plant successfully smelted copper using half wood charcoal and half blue charcoal); (4) There are no copper smelting technicians, only local iron furnace masters can smelt copper; (5) Low-grade ore can also be smelted using local methods (the ore they use contains only 2%-3% copper). This experience has universal promotion value, and Yibin, Qingfu and other counties have sent people to study it.

Gaoxian fully relied on the strength of the masses in the construction of the copper plant, implementing the spirit of diligence and thrift in construction and self-reliance. Without engineering and technical personnel, they sought talent and visited able people in the countryside, inviting farmers who had used local methods to smelt copper, iron, and coke to be masters. In this factory, in addition to a copper smelting furnace and a newly built triangular thatched shed for storing raw materials, there are no other buildings. Dozens of workers live on the floor of nearby farmers' living rooms. Cooking is also done using farmers' pots and stoves. Most of the labor for mining, bellows operation, and transportation is drawn from agricultural cooperatives in a planned way after consultation with the agricultural cooperatives, as a sideline form of production for the agricultural cooperatives.

Furthermore, the Longhua Copper Plant in Pingshan County is exactly the opposite of the Gaoxian Copper Plant. This plant started construction in July of last year and has spent 25,000 yuan to date without seeing a single piece of copper. Due to the emphasis on "standardization," there was originally a farmer's house in the factory area that could be used, but they demolished and rebuilt it, spending six or seven thousand yuan. Seven or eight forging furnaces, blast furnaces, and reverberatory furnaces were built, but due to poor planning, there was no fuel for copper smelting within 20 to 30 miles of the factory area. Transporting it from other places was difficult due to inconvenient transportation, resulting in high costs and inability to produce. Before production had even started, they recruited a batch of personnel from the city, and the management cadres, from the factory director to the accountant, cashier, and clerk, were fully staffed.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Bihua took this picture: China's first modern phosphate mine is under intense construction at Jinpingshan on the west coast of the Yellow Sea in Jiangsu Province, and is expected to be completed this year. After the mine is completed, a large amount of phosphate rock will be supplied to chemical fertilizer plants to manufacture fertilizers.

### 高县投资三百元一个月建成铜厂  屏山龙华铜厂花钱二万五，半年多没见一点铜

    高县投资三百元一个月建成铜厂
    屏山龙华铜厂花钱二万五，半年多没见一点铜
    本报讯　据四川日报报道：高县今年新建一座铜厂，只花三百元钱，不到一月个，就投入生产，投入生产不到十天就收回全部投资。这个厂今年计划生产铜三百吨。
    高县铜厂创造的炼铜法有五大特点：（一）连续加料，连续出铜（四川其他地方炼铜是出一次铜，停一次火）；（二）用冷风也可以炼铜
  （用风箱打进炉内的风未经热处理成为热风）；（三）使用兰炭也可炼铜（兰炭是次于焦炭的一种炭，高县铜厂是用一半木炭，一半蓝炭炼铜成功）；（四）没有炼铜技术人员，只有土铁炉掌炉师也可炼铜；
  （五）利用土法也可炼低品位的矿石（他们所用矿石含铜只2％—3％）。这个经验具有普遍推广价值，宜宾、庆符等县都派人去学习。
    高县在建设铜厂中充分依靠群众力量，贯彻勤俭建设、自力更生的精神。没有工程技术人员，他们就到农村求贤访能，请曾经用土法炼铜、炼铁、炼焦的农民来当师傅。在这个工厂里，除了一座炼铜炉和一个新扎的堆放原料的三角茅棚之外，再无其他建筑物。几十个工人是住在附近农民的堂屋的地上。作饭也是借农民的锅灶。开矿、拉风箱、抬运等劳动力，大半是和农业社磋商，有计划的从农业社抽调，作为农业社的副业形式来生产。
    又讯　四川屏山县龙华铜厂刚好与高县铜厂相反。这个厂从去年7月份开始建厂，至今已花了二万五千元，未见一点铜。由于强调“正规化”，本来厂区有一户农民的房子可以用，但他们拆掉重建，花去了六、七千元。锻炉、高炉、反射炉共修了七、八座，但是因为计划不周，在厂区二、三十里路以内没有炼铜的燃料，从别处运来，又因交通不便，运输困难，成本很高而不能生产。在生产还没有着落的时候，他们就去城市招收来一批人员，至于管理干部，由厂长到会计、出纳、事务员，更是配备齐全。（附图片）
