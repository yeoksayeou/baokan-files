"Laggard King" Sets New Record
By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

The meeting had been going on for quite some time, but still no conclusion.

The Fengtai Locomotive Depot drivers were discussing the new 1958 timetable. Starting from February 1st, the trains were to run faster. A trip from Fengtai to Tianjin had to be reduced from two hours and forty-five minutes to two hours and sixteen minutes.

Old driver Lu Ruiming kept shaking his head at the meeting and said, "It won't work." He said that this would be like saying that the locomotive was pulling more than five hundred seven-ton trucks, and had to rush from Fengtai to Tianjin in one breath, without even time to take on water. How could that work? If you drive slowly and use less water, you might not need to take on water along the way, but now you're running so fast, you'll use a lot of water. If there's a windy day, and you use more energy, you'll use even more water. What do you do then? Besides, the seven minutes between Shenzhuang and Tianjin station is too short, it’s such a rush that something is bound to happen. This is really wanting the horse to run fast but not wanting it to eat grass! He asked the leaders to either add five minutes, or replace the train with a larger water tank, so that they wouldn’t have to take on water halfway.

Several drivers agreed with him and raised a lot of difficulties.

Hu Chundong, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive, had a different view. He said, "No problem, we guarantee we can do it, and we'll even try to exceed the new timetable."

At this point, Lu Ruiming and several old drivers got anxious. Last year, everyone averaged just over forty kilometers per hour, and even the Mao Zedong locomotive only managed forty-six point four kilometers. But the new timetable says forty-nine point five kilometers per hour! It was just impossible.

Lu Ruiming had his own reasons for saying this. He had run the Beijing-Tianjin line thousands of times, and could almost do it with his eyes closed. He knew that last year his train was delayed one hundred and sixteen times, totaling two hundred and eighteen minutes (according to the old timetable).

He also thought: What's the big deal if the freight train is late? If the train runs faster, it uses more energy and more coal. Coal is precious, and in short supply. Saving coal is good for the country and for yourself, and you can get bonuses. Also, there's a subsidy for working eight hours a day, and if you run fast, you get off work in less than eight hours, and you don't get it. Although he didn’t care about the extra three mao of subsidy per day, there were two other people on the train! Who knows if they would want it?

A couple of days later, the branch secretary called a meeting with the drivers who hadn't completed their tasks. They were still the same, talking about difficulties and difficulties. After listening to everyone, the branch secretary took out a small notebook and said calmly, "Let me do some calculations for you. One is: the old timetable averaged forty-six kilometers per hour, and the new timetable is forty-nine point five kilometers. If we go four kilometers faster per hour, the entire section can go sixty-six thousand two hundred and forty kilometers faster in a year. For every kilometer we run, the bureau can earn thirteen yuan and five fen more, which means we can earn eight hundred and sixty-four thousand four hundred and thirty-two yuan more per year.

"Another thing: everyone can calculate how many days of bad weather there are in a year? Let's take last year as an example! There were only a few days. At most, let's say a month, then the eleven months of running faster can make up for it. Besides, in bad weather, the dispatching office won't add more cars, so it won't be hard to run."

Eighty thousand! Running faster has such a big advantage, which they never thought of! Lu Ruiming also calculated the number of coal savings. This year, the entire section plans to save more than four thousand tons of coal, which is how much money? Only more than eighty thousand yuan.

After the meeting, Lu Ruiming's mind started to work.

The Party Committee Secretary has made several reports on "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind"! To surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years! Britain is an old-fashioned imperialist country with more than two hundred years of industrial foundation, and to surpass it, we must work harder!

Since the rectification campaign, comrades have posted countless big-character posters and made many suggestions. The leaders have made changes to what can be changed immediately, and have also responded to what cannot be done immediately. Cadres and workers are as close as a family. Many people say that working now is extremely enjoyable. He was also like that, and wanted to do more, but why couldn't he do it when he encountered specific problems?

He also recalled the scenes he had seen on the line these days. Day and night, he always saw large groups of people in the fields accumulating fertilizer and digging ditches. The wind was blowing so hard, and in the sub-zero nights, women and old men were still working in the fields. The lanterns were strung together, and from a distance, they looked like fire dragons, which was really touching!

He remembered an incident: one day, when the farmers at the South Signal Station were repairing a canal, they accidentally broke a water pump, and they needed to use it soon. What to do? They found the vehicle depot. The comrades at the vehicle depot managed to fix it. When the farmers left, they thanked them again and again, saying how good the working-class elder brothers were, how they supported them, how they made machines, fertilizers, and insecticides for them... and transported them to them... They must repair the canal well and build socialism as soon as possible.

Lu Ruiming thought, the farmers are so patriotic, and he is still a leading class! But all he thinks about all day long is bonuses, bonuses, which is really outrageous!

"What can I do for the country and for the farmers?" Lu Ruiming thought of the tractors and the double-wheel double-furrow plows that were pulled by the train... He thought, if he could deliver the machines to the farmers earlier, and transport the agricultural products to the city earlier, wouldn't he be doing his part?

But how can he run faster? He still couldn't figure it out.

One day at a meeting, Comrade Yue Shangwu, the deputy director of the transportation workshop, came. He said, "Everyone says that it can't be opened fast, but who has really let go and tried it? If you don't try, how can you say you can't?..."

Lu Ruiming thought: "That's right! Who would have thought that the Chinese would build trains, cars, and airplanes a few years ago? Now, aren't they running and flying one by one?" He also thought of Wang Chonglun, wasn't he just an ordinary worker? How could he invent the universal tool tire? It can be seen that there is nothing difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it.

He put in more effort, and it was strange to say, but he drove faster and faster, a few minutes faster each time.

On January 30th, he went to the depot and saw the yard full of posters of good news: Mao Zedong locomotive driver Hu Chundong set a new record! A technical speed of fifty-three point nine kilometers (an average of fifty-three point nine kilometers per hour), saving nine hundred and fifty-nine kilograms of coal.

That's enough, Hu Chundong did what he said.

The Mao Zedong locomotive is the oldest in the entire section, with a history of twenty years. How can people run so fast! He had to ask.

Before long, Hu Chundong came. As soon as he got off the train, the leaders asked him to introduce his experience to everyone.

"To be honest, there's nothing really, I just paid attention to a few
things: Before leaving, hold a small meeting with the deputy driver and the fireman to divide
head to prepare, such as using large pieces of coal to start the fire, etc. After the train
After driving, the first stop forces acceleration, especially driving fast, fierce. On the road, communicate frequently with the crew, and also communicate frequently with the dispatch office, asking if there are any cars blocking the front, and if you can drive fast? When you get to the terminal station, you must be steady when entering the station, and you must be strong when applying the brake..."

Doesn't it cost coal to drive fast? How can you save it? Lu Ruiming didn't understand, but later he figured it out. The principle is the same as riding a bicycle. Start hard, and then use the inertia of the car. If you don't pedal, the car will still move forward. If you encounter a downhill, that's even better, you can glide. This saves effort and coal.

Measuring himself with Hu Chundong's method, he hadn't done any of them. "I can't always think about whether I get a bonus or not, and always think about how others treat me. I used to think like that, which was not right. I should think more about how to benefit the work!" He thought this way.

On February 1st, they left according to the new time. Before leaving, Lu Ruiming talked to the deputy driver and the fireman: "What others have done, we must also do. Everyone is competing to be advanced, and we cannot compete to be backward." The fireman replied very happily: "You run with your legs open! I will definitely keep the locomotive full of water and full of air!" It turned out that with the help of the Youth League Committee, the fireman had also wanted to make a big splash for a long time. The deputy driver also said: "We must make this first shot, get on the honor roll, and not always wear the hat of 'transportation slowdown king'!"

Today, they are pulling two thousand four hundred and twenty-two tons, and all three of them are very nervous. They did it according to Hu Chundong's method. The first stop was a little bit hard, but after that, they ran away. They averaged fifty-six point eight kilometers per hour. The return trip was uphill, pulling two thousand two hundred and six tons, and running fifty-two point two kilometers per hour. Averaging the round trip, they ran fifty-four point five kilometers per hour, saving six hundred and five kilograms of coal. They surpassed Hu Chundong.

This was a great news: The "transportation slowdown king" has set a new record!

The branch talked to Lu Ruiming and the other two, and gave them encouragement, asking them to introduce their experience to others. All of a sudden, the entire section seemed to have another fire lit, burning up. Everyone said: "Those who are lagging behind have gone up, and we have to catch up."

Many who had always been lagging behind, who used to drive slowly and unhurriedly, and who were neither ahead nor behind, all ran to the front one by one.

Hu Chundong has been extremely busy these days. Many drivers have asked him to come to the train to give guidance. He helps others while learning from others. In a few days, his record rose to fifty-eight point one kilometers.

After that, one competed with another, one achievement was higher than another, and groups were revising their plans, some revising three times, and some revising four times.

Not long after, the driver Li Wenxiao set a top-notch record of sixty point three five kilometers of technical speed.

The Mao Zedong locomotive drivers are in meetings all day long thinking of ways. They say that when the train starts running (Hu Chundong went to the Northeast, and the Mao Zedong locomotive has not been running for ten days), they will be able to catch up with Li Wenxiao. They said, "We can't embarrass Chairman Mao!"

Lu Ruiming is also thinking hard. He says he has a good idea and can catch up with Li Wenxiao.

But others are not giving up either, and are all thinking of ways. Who will win and who will lose is hard to say now! (Attached picture)

    “迟缓大王”创新纪录
    本报记者　傅冬
    会开了好半天了，还没结果。
    丰台机务段司机讨论的是1958年的新运行图。从2月1号起，火车要跑得更快了。由丰台到天津跑一趟，时间要从二点四十五分减到二点十六分。
    老司机鲁瑞明在会上一个劲儿地摇头说：“行不通。”他说，这么一来，那不就等于说，火车头后面拉着五百多辆七吨重的大卡车，一口气要由丰台赶到天津，中间连上水的时间都没有，那怎么行？要是走的慢，水用的少，路上不上水还可以，现在跑这么快，水准用的多。碰上刮风天，使劲大，那水用的更多了。怎办？再说，沈庄到天津那一站只七分钟太少了，赶的那样紧，非出事不可。这真是又叫马儿好，又叫马儿不吃草！他请领导上要末给加五分钟，要末给车上换个大水柜，那半路上就不要上水了。
    有几个司机赞成他的意见，也提了一大堆困难。
    毛泽东号司机胡春东的看法却不一样。他说：“没问题，我们保证做到，还要想法超过新图。”
    这一下，鲁瑞明和几个老司机都急了。去年，大伙平均一点钟都只走四十多公里，毛泽东号最快，也不过四十六点四公里。而新图上写的是一点钟要走四十九点五公里呀！说什么，也不行。
    鲁瑞明说这话，是有他自己的理由的。北京到天津这条道儿，他走了几千趟了，可以说闭着眼睛也差不离能摸到。那知道去年一年他的车晚点一百一十六次，迟了二百一十八分（按旧图）。
    他还这样想：货车晚点怕什么，车跑快了，使的劲大，用的煤多。煤是金子，缺得很。省煤，对国家、对自己都有好处，可拿奖金。还有，每天干八个钟头有津贴，跑快了，不到八小时下班，拿不到。自己虽不在乎一天多拿三毛钱津贴，但是，车头上不是自家一个，还有二个人呢！谁知道人家愿意不愿意？
    过了两天，支部书记找他们几个说完不成任务的司机开会。他们还是老样子，张口困难，闭口困难。听大伙谈完了，支部书记掏出个小本本，不紧不慢地说：“我来给大伙算两笔账。一笔是：旧图一点钟平均走四十六公里，新图走四十九点五公里。假如我们一点钟快四公里，一年全段就可快六万六千二百四十公里。多跑一公里，局里可以多收入十三元零五分，这样一年就可多收入八十六万四千四百三十二元。
    “另一笔：大家算算看一年到底有多少天天气不好？拿去年来说吧！只有几天。了不起，就打上一个月，那十一个月跑快点，也可拉过来。再说，天气不好，调度所自己就不给多挂车，不会跑不动。”
    八十万！跑快点，有这么大好处，这可是想也没想到的事！鲁瑞明又算了算节煤的数字，今年全段打算省煤四千多吨，合多少钱呢？才八万多元。
    开完会，鲁瑞明的脑子就活动开了。
    党委书记作了好几次“东风压倒西风”的报告啦！在主要工业产品产量方面十五年赶过英国！英国是个老牌帝国主义，有二百多年的工业底子，要赶过它，得加把劲！
    整风以来，同志们贴了无数张大字报，提了好些意见，领导上能改的，当下就改了，不能马上作的，也都有答复。干部和工人亲热得像一家人似的。好些人说，现在干起活来，痛快极了。自己也是这样，也想多干点，可怎么一碰到具体问题又不行了呢？
    他又想起，这些天在线路上看到的情景。白天、晚上，总见一大群人在地里积肥、挖渠。风刮得那么大，零下十几度的夜里，妇女、老头仍在地里干活。灯笼一串一串的，远远看去，就像一条条火龙似的，真叫人感动！
    他记起一件事：有一天南信号站农民在修渠时，不小心把一个抽水机给弄坏了，等着用，怎么办呢？找到车辆段。车辆段的同志想法收拾好了，农民走时千谢万谢，说工人老大哥怎么怎么好，如何如何支援他们，给他们造机器、肥料、虫药……还给他们运去……他们一定要好好修渠，早日建成社会主义。
      鲁瑞明想，农民都这么爱国，自己还是个领导阶级呢！可是整天想的是什么奖金、奖金，真不像话！
      “我能给国家、给农民作点什么呢？”鲁瑞明想起火车上拉的那一台台拖拉机，一件件双轮双铧犁……他想，把机器早一点送到农民手里，把农产品早点运到城里，自己不就尽了一份力量吗？
    可是怎么能跑的快点？他还是想不出法子来。
    有天开会，运转车间的副主任岳尚武同志来了。他说：“大伙说开不快，可是谁真放开手试了试呢？没试，那怎么能说不能？……”
    鲁瑞明一想：“说的是呀！前几年谁能想到中国人会造火车、汽车和飞机呢？现在不是一辆辆跑的跑，飞的飞了吗？”他又想起王崇伦，他不也是个普通工人吗？他怎么能发明万能工具胎呢？可见天下无难事，只怕有心人。
    他加了把劲，说也怪，开的果然快了，一次比一次快几分。
    1月30日，他到段上，见满院子贴满了喜报：毛泽东号司机胡春东创新纪录！技速五十三点九公里（一点钟平均跑五十三点九公里），节煤九百五十九公斤。
    真够意思，胡春东说到就作到。
    毛泽东号机车在全段算最老的，有二十年历史了，人家怎么能跑的那么快呢！得要问问。
    没一会，胡春东来了。他刚下车，领导上就请他给大伙介绍经验。
    “说起来，真没啥，我只是注意了几
  件事：走以前和副司机、司炉开小会，分
  头作准备工作，如用大块煤打火底等，车
  开以后，头一站强迫加速，特别开的快，猛。路上，勤和伙计们联系，也勤和调度所联系，问前面有没有车挡着，能不能开快？到终点站，进站要稳，下闸要狠……”
    车开的快，不是费煤吗？怎么会省？鲁瑞明不明白，后来才弄清楚了，这道理就和骑自行车一样，开头猛，以后利用车子的惰力，不蹬车，车也往前走。要是遇下坡路，那更好了，可以滑行。这样又省劲，又省煤。
    用胡春东的法子量量自己，自己一样也没作。“我不能老想着自己拿不拿奖金，老想着别人对我怎么样，过去老这么想，不对劲，应多想怎么作对工作有好处！”他这样想。
    2月1号按新钟点走了。走以前，鲁瑞明找副司机、司炉谈：“人家作到的，咱们也要作到。人家都在比先进，咱不能比落后。”司炉回答的很痛快：“您撒开腿跑吧！我一定叫机车水满满的，气足足的！”原来司炉在团委的帮助下，也早想大干一场了。副司机也说：“咱们一定要打响这头一炮，上光荣榜，不能老戴着‘运缓大王’的帽子！”
    今儿个拉二千四百二十二吨，三个人都很紧张。他们照着胡春东的法儿作。头一站稍稍吃力点，但过后，就跑开了。一点钟平均跑了五十六点八公里。回来是上坡路，拉了二千二百零六吨，一个钟头跑了五十二点二公里。来回一匀，一点钟跑五十四点五公里，省了六百零五公斤煤。赶过了胡春东。
    这可是个了不得的消息：“运缓大王”创新纪录啦！
    支部找鲁瑞明等三人谈话，又给打了打气，叫他们向人介绍经验。这一下，全段像又点了把火，烧起来了。大伙说：“落后的都上去了，咱得加紧追。”
    许多一向落在后面的，平日开车开的不紧不慢，走的不前不后的人都一个个跑到前面去了。
    胡春东这几天忙得不得了，好些司机请他去车上指点，他一面帮人家，一面学人家的本事。没几天他的纪录升到五十八点一公里。
    这以后一个赛一个，一个成绩比一个高，组组都在改计划，有的改三次，有的改四次。
    又过了没多少天，司机李文孝又创了个技速六十点三五公里顶呱呱的纪录。
    毛泽东号的司机们整天在开会想办法，他们说，等车开起来（胡春东去东北，毛泽东号机车有十天没开车），准能赶过李文孝。他们这样说：“我们不能给毛主席丢人！”
    鲁瑞明也在琢磨，他说他心里有数，他能赶过李文孝。
    可是别的人也不认输，都在想法子。谁胜谁败，现在很难说呢！（附图片）
