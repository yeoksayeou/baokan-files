    Welcome the Most Beloved People to Join the Construction
    By Yin Weichen, Director of the Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative, Beijing
    Our loved ones have returned victoriously. We, the farmers, like the people of the whole country, express our warm welcome to them.
    In October 1953, I participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to express our regards. I heard many heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army. Their spirit of bravery, tenacity, and fearlessness of difficulties gave me a profound education.
    Currently, the people of the whole country are making a great leap forward, and our cooperative is also making a great leap forward. We plan to achieve water conservancy this year, followed by electrification. This year, we guarantee a yield of 1,300 jin of grain per mu, and strive for 1,500 jin; the 10,000 mu of vegetables we plant are planned to yield 10,000 jin per mu. The Volunteer Army has returned at a time of this national great leap forward, and will surely become a great force in our construction. We have a member in our cooperative named Zheng Laicheng, who is a disabled veteran of the Volunteer Army. Although one of his legs is disabled and one of his eyes is injured, he is truly excellent when he works, even better than people with sound limbs. Recently, he was selected as a "Five-Good" model member. And how many people like Zheng Laicheng are there in the Volunteer Army! Now that they are returning to the construction of the motherland, how can all of our farmers and the people of the whole country not be extremely excited? We must learn from their great spirit of overcoming difficulties, and we must compete with them in the enthusiasm for building socialism, to build our country faster and better.

    欢迎最可爱的人参加到建设中来
    北京黄土岗农业  生产合作社主任  殷维臣
    我们的亲人胜利的回来了。我们农民，和全国人民一样，向他们表示热烈的欢迎。
    1953年10月，我曾经参加中国人民赴朝慰问团到朝鲜去慰问。听到了许许多多志愿军的英雄事迹。他们那种英勇顽强不怕困难的精神，给了我深刻的教育。
    目前，全国人民都在大跃进，我们合作社也在大跃进。我们计划今年就要实现水利化，接着就搞电气化。今年保证每亩产粮食一千三百斤，争取一千五百斤；种的一万亩蔬菜，计划每亩产一万斤。志愿军在这个全国大跃进的时候回来了，一定会成为我们建设中一支很大的力量。我们社里有一个社员，叫郑来成，他是志愿军残废军人。虽然他的一支腿残废了，一只眼睛也受了伤，可是干起活来真是好样的，连肢体健全的人也比不上他。最近他已被选为“五好”模范社员了。而像郑来成这样的人，在志愿军里该有多少啊！现在他们就要回到祖国建设中来了，我们全体农民，全国人民怎能不感到万分兴奋呢？我们一定要学习他们克服困难的伟大精神，一定要和他们比建设社会主义的干劲，把我们的国家建设得更快，更好。
