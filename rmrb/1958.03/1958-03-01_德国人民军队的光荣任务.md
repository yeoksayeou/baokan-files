    The question of peace and how to ensure lasting peace is a major concern for the whole world today. The representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries clearly explained the importance of this issue in the Peace Manifesto adopted at the Moscow Conference.
    This manifesto, in the spirit of Leninism, effectively exposes the roots of war to the people of all countries. It particularly warned the German people, who bear a great responsibility for ensuring peace in Europe. The people of the socialist camp are watching the development of the situation in West Germany. In West Germany, almost every day a national leader or militarist issues war threats against the peace-loving socialist camp. They openly demand to lead the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; they are trying their best to adopt and develop their own atomic weapons and rocket weapons, blindly pursuing a suicidal policy of turning West Germany into a hotbed of war.
    In view of this dangerous development, the international responsibility of the German Democratic Republic and its role as a bastion of peace and socialism are constantly growing. By implementing a persistent peace policy, exerting all its material and moral strength, and with the support of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic has shattered all attempts by imperialism to invade the western flank of the socialist camp. This also shows that we cannot simply deal with the intensified remilitarization actions of the West German authorities with political statements.
    On January 18, 1956, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic passed the Law on the Establishment of the National People's Army and the Ministry of National Defense. Events over the past two years have clearly demonstrated how correct and timely this measure aimed at safeguarding peace was. Especially during the days of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, the existence of the National People's Army and the unwavering loyalty of all officers and soldiers to the worker-peasant regime were an important factor in thwarting the attempts of imperialist countries to undermine the German Democratic Republic and the socialist camp.
    This fact, as well as the summary of the establishment of the first units of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic, gives us every reason to say that the army of the first German worker-peasant state is at all times a reliable ally of the armies of the socialist camp on the western outpost.
    The guarantee in this regard does not lie in the large number of our troops or their sophisticated equipment, but primarily in its nature and basic political stance.
    The National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is an army of the worker-peasant regime, educated by Marxist-Leninist thought and the revolutionary traditions of the German working class, and under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is the builder and leader of the German Democratic Republic's military policy and the army.
    The party organizations and political departments of the National People's Army are carrying out effective work, educating officers and soldiers with Marxist-Leninist thought and enhancing their sense of responsibility for completing military tasks. The thoughts and actions of all members of the National People's Army are determined by the important position occupied by the German Democratic Republic in the socialist camp, because the western boundary of our republic is also the boundary directly in contact with the capitalist camp. However, our western neighbor, the Federal Republic of Germany, is precisely the country that concentrates the most aggressive imperialist and militarist forces in Europe. The main forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are stationed on its territory. In addition, it has established a dangerous bridgehead in the heart of the German Democratic Republic through West Berlin.
    In view of this situation, the officers and soldiers of the National People's Army understand that the German Democratic Republic's participation in the socialist camp, the National People's Army's participation in the joint forces of the Warsaw Treaty countries, and the friendship and support of the Soviet Union and socialist countries for our republic are the most important guarantees for the German Democratic Republic to achieve new victories in socialist construction and to thwart the adventurous plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    For our soldiers, the idea of proletarian internationalism and the fighting friendship with the armies of the socialist camp countries are becoming increasingly important. This is reflected in their constant efforts to achieve good military results, so as not to fail the trust of the people and armies of the socialist camp countries.
    There are many examples to show that our soldiers are always ready to faithfully fulfill their national and international obligations within the scope of the Warsaw Treaty. In the spirit of fulfilling these obligations, the National People's Army established many friendly contacts with its comrades-in-arms shortly after its establishment.
    At the invitation of Chinese Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, a delegation of the National People's Army headed by Minister of National Defense General Stoph visited the People's Republic of China last autumn. This visit was of great political significance. General Stoph said in a statement on the visit: "Many inspirations and experiences, many greetings and wishes for the victorious construction of our National People's Army, will help to further improve combat training and enhance defense capabilities... Linked together by common struggle goals gives the people and National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic strength and confidence in the struggle to consolidate peace in Europe and restore the unity of the motherland. There is complete agreement that the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, together with the peace forces of the world, will smash all attacks by the imperialists on the freedom and independence of all countries."
    When military comrades from many socialist countries visited our army, they could see with their own eyes the willingness and determination of our soldiers to serve this just cause with all their strength. For example, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army once said: "I have a very good impression of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic... Living here are kind people who are fighting for socialism on the front lines. We are closely united in the socialist camp to prevent imperialist aggression."
    The National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is the youngest army in the alliance of socialist camp armies. All the achievements we have made are due to the party and the government of our worker-peasant regime. We also attribute all this to the love and support of the working people of the German Democratic Republic and the selfless assistance of our Soviet friends.
    The National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is today an indispensable factor in defending the western border of the socialist camp. It is powerful and invincible because it is deeply rooted in the working people and led by the working class party, and because it stands as a faithful and reliable ally on the side of the Soviet Union and the armies of the people's democratic countries.

    德国人民军队的光荣任务
    德意志民主共和国  哥特弗利·格林贝格上校
    关心和平和怎样保障持久和平，是今天全世界关心的重要问题。各国共产党和工人党的代表在莫斯科会议通过的和平宣言中，对这个问题的重要意义作了清楚的说明。
    这个宣言本着列宁主义的精神，向各国人民有效地揭露了战争的根源。它特别对保障欧洲和平负有巨大责任的德国人民发出了警告。社会主义阵营各国人民注视着西德情势的发展。在西德，几乎每天都有一个国家领导人或军国主义者要向爱好和平的社会主义阵营发出战争威胁。他们公开要求领导北大西洋公约集团；他们竭力采用并自己发展原子武器和火箭武器，盲目地推行变西德为战争温床的自杀政策。
    鉴于这种危险的发展，德意志民主共和国的国际责任和作为和平和社会主义堡垒的作用不断地增长。由于实行了坚持不渝的和平政策，发挥了一切物质上和道义上的力量，以及得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的支持，德意志民主共和国粉碎了帝国主义在社会主义阵营西翼的一切入侵企图。这也表明，我们不能仅仅以政治声明来对付西德当权者加紧重新军国主义化的行动。
    1956年1月18日，德意志民主共和国人民议院通过了关于成立国家人民军和国防部的法律。过去两年的事件清楚地证明，旨在保障和平的这一措施是多么正确而及时。特别是在匈牙利反革命叛乱的日子里，国家人民军的存在和全体官兵对工农政权的不可动摇的忠诚，是粉碎帝国主义国家破坏德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营的企图的一个重要因素。
    这个事实以及德意志民主共和国国家人民军第一批部队建立以来的总结，使我们完全有理由说，第一个德意志工农国家的军队，在任何时候都是社会主义阵营军队在西方前哨的可靠的同盟军。
    这方面的保证并不在于我们军队的人数众多或装备精良，而是首先在于它的性质和基本政治立场。
    德意志民主共和国国家人民军是一支工农政权的军队，它受到马克思列宁主义思想和德国工人阶级革命传统的教育，以及德国统一社会党的领导。德国统一社会党是德意志民主共和国军事政策以及军队的建设者和领导者。
    国家人民军的党组织和政治部进行着卓有成效的工作，它们用马克思列宁主义思想教育官兵，并提高他们对完成军事任务的责任感。国家人民军全体成员的思想和行动都是由这个事实所决定的，这就是德意志民主共和国在社会主义阵营中所占有的重要地位，因为我们共和国的西界同时是与资本主义阵营直接接触的界线。但是我们的西邻——德意志联邦共和国恰恰是集中欧洲最富有侵略性的帝国主义和军国主义势力的国家，在它的领土上驻扎着北大西洋公约集团的主力部队，此外它通过西柏林在德意志民主共和国的心脏建立了一个危险的桥头堡。
    鉴于这种形势，国家人民军的官兵都懂得，德意志民主共和国参加社会主义阵营，国家人民军参加华沙条约国家的联合部队以及苏联和社会主义各国对我们共和国的友谊和支持，是德意志民主共和国社会主义建设取得新的胜利，粉碎北大西洋公约集团冒险计划的最重要的保证。
    对我们的战士来说，无产阶级国际主义思想和同社会主义阵营各国军队的战斗友谊，正日益成为头等重要的事情。他们经常努力获得良好的军事成绩，以不辜负社会主义阵营各国人民和军队的信任，也反映出了这一点。
    有许多例子可以说明，我们的战士在任何时候都准备在华沙条约的范围内，忠实地完成自己的民族义务和国际义务。本着履行这些义务的精神，国家人民军成立不久就同它的战友建立了许多友好的联系。
    以国防部长斯多夫上将为首的国家人民军代表团，应中国国防部长彭德怀元帅的邀请，在去年秋天访问了中华人民共和国。这次访问具有重大的政治意义。斯多夫上将对这次访问发表声明说：“许许多多的启发和经验，许许多多的问候和对我国国家人民军的胜利建设的祝愿，将有助于进一步改进战斗训练和提高防御能力……通过共同的斗争目标联系在一起，就给予德意志民主共和国人民和国家人民军在争取巩固欧洲和平和恢复祖国统一的斗争中以力量和信心。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家，将同全世界和平力量一起粉碎帝国主义者对各国人民的自由独立的一切进攻，对这一点的看法是完全一致的。”
    许多社会主义国家的军官同志在访问我国军队时，可以亲眼看到我们的战士用全部力量来为这个正义事业服务的意愿和决心。例如，中国人民解放军的一位代表曾经这样说过：“我对德意志民主共和国国家人民军获得了很好的印象……生活在这儿的是善良的人们，他们在最前线为社会主义而奋斗。我们紧密地团结在社会主义阵营中，以防止帝国主义的侵略。”
    德意志民主共和国国家人民军是社会主义阵营军队同盟中最年轻的军队。我们所获得的一切成就，都归功于党和我们工农政权的政府。我们也把这一切归功于德意志民主共和国劳动人民的爱戴和支持，以及我们苏联朋友的无私援助。
    德意志民主共和国国家人民军，今天是保卫社会主义阵营西界的一个不可忽略的因素。它是强大的和不可战胜的，因为它在劳动人民中深深地扎下了根，并受到工人阶级政党的领导，因为它是作为忠实可靠的同盟者站在苏联和各人民民主国家军队这一边的。（附图片）
