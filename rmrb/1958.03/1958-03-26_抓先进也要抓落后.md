Grasp the Advanced, But Also Grasp the Backward
Qian Yin

After comparing the advanced and comparing enthusiasm, many enterprises have seen the following situation: the advanced have become more advanced, the intermediate are catching up vigorously, while the backward, on the other hand, are being left further and further behind.

Neglecting the backward while grasping the advanced shows that we have neglected an important aspect in our enterprise leadership work.

Changing the backward situation and transforming backward workers is a leadership art. Generally speaking, grasping the advanced is relatively easy; but grasping the backward is much more detailed and complicated than grasping the advanced. To transform backward workers, it is necessary to study their various specific manifestations, then analyze the reasons for backwardness, and finally adopt the method of opening each lock with a key; some leaders need to make self-criticisms, some need to conduct multiple individual talks, some involve work arrangements and deployments, and have to be rearranged. Doing this not only requires a considerable amount of work, but also requires extreme care. Obviously, this is not an easy task, but it can enable leaders to learn a skill that cannot be learned under normal circumstances. Those who are afraid of trouble will find it difficult to gain experience in this area.

Originally, grasping the advanced and conducting competitions was intended to establish opposing forces in the enterprise, to make the backward catch up with the advanced, and to turn the advanced level into a social level. If only the advanced are grasped and the backward are not grasped, or if the backward are not grasped enough, this will lose the function of establishing opposing forces. In any case, every enterprise has three parts of people: advanced, intermediate, and backward. These three parts of people represent three ideological levels and three production levels. These three levels are closely related to each other. To improve the level of the enterprise, all three parts need to be improved, otherwise, the improvement of the enterprise will be affected due to the slow progress of one aspect. The advanced are the opposite of the backward. Grasping the advanced is to establish a benchmark and encourage everyone to learn from the advanced benchmark. Grasping the backward is not only to break through weak links and urge backward workers to catch up with the intermediate and advanced, but also the action of transforming backward workers is a promotion for the intermediate elements, and it is also a strong spur to the advanced benchmark. Li Yinhe, a backward worker at the Changxindian Rolling Stock Plant, said before his transformation: "I either don't do it, or if I do it, I will definitely catch up with Zhang Jinming, the advanced producer in our workshop." After this transformation, his production performance quickly caught up with Zhang Jinming. This is a matter that deserves deep thought. Why was he unwilling to do it in the past? And why can he now exceed the advanced level? This example illustrates many problems, the main one being: as long as the leadership pays attention to grasping the backward, the backward may become advanced. Once the backward surpass the advanced, it will inevitably cause new tension. The advanced will become more advanced, and the intermediate and backward will also have more confidence and determination to learn from the advanced because they have role models.

It is precisely because grasping the backward has such profound significance that whether the backward is transformed well has become an important link in the current socialist competition movement. Whether the backward can catch up with the advanced has also become one aspect of measuring whether the rectification work is deep and thorough.

The fact that backward workers in the Changxindian Rolling Stock Plant are transforming one after another raises an important issue for the current in-depth rectification of enterprises. The rectification movement, especially the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, has deeply touched the hearts of backward workers. Many people feel that they can no longer continue to lag behind and have expressed that they will overcome their shortcomings and catch up. Seizing this great opportunity to raise every member of the enterprise to an advanced level is a task that the current enterprise leaders cannot ignore.

### 抓先进也要抓落后

    抓先进也要抓落后
    千音
    在比先进、比干劲以后，不少企业出现了这样的情况：先进的更先进了，中间的猛赶猛追，而落后的哩，却是越拉越远。
    抓先进忽视落后，这说明了我们企业领导工作中忽视了一个重要方面。
    改变落后状况，使落后工人转变过来，这是一种领导艺术。一般地说，抓先进是比较容易的；而抓落后比起抓先进来却要细致复杂得多。要使落后工人转变过来，就要研究他们的各种具体表现，进而分析落后原因，最后采取一把钥匙开一把锁的办法；有的领导人要作自我批评，有的要进行多次的个别谈话，有的涉及工作安排和部署，还得重新安排。这样作，不仅工作量相当大，而且还要求极其细心。显然，这不是一件轻松的工作，但却能使领导人学到一种在通常情况下学不到的本领。而怕麻烦的人，也就难以取得这方面的经验了。
    本来抓先进搞评比，就是要在企业里树立对立面，就是要使落后的赶上先进，把先进的水平变成社会性的水平，如果只抓先进不抓落后，或是对落后面抓得不够，这就会失去树立对立面的作用。在任何情况下，每个企业都有先进、中间、落后三个部分的人。这三部分人是代表了三种思想水平和三种生产水平。这三种水平又是彼此密切地联系着的。要提高企业的水平，三部分人都需要提高，否则，就会因为一方面的进展迟缓，而使企业的提高受到影响。先进是落后的对立面，抓先进，就是为了树立标兵，鼓舞大家向先进的标兵看齐。抓落后、不仅仅是为了突破薄弱环节，督促落后工人追中间赶先进，而且落后工人转变的行动，对中间分子来说是个推动，对先进的标兵来说，也是一种有力的鞭策。长辛店车辆厂落后工人李印和在转变前曾说过：“我要么不干，要干的话，一定会赶过我们车间里的先进生产者张金铭。”这次转变以后，他的生产成绩很快就赶过了张金铭。这是值得引起深思的一件事情。过去他为什么不肯干呢？而现在又为什么能超过先进水平呢？这个例子说明的问题很多，主要的是：只要领导上注意抓落后面，落后者就可能成为先进者。一旦落后赶过了先进，势必引起新的紧张。先进的将会更先进，中间和落后的也会因为有了榜样，他们向先进看齐的信心会更足，决心会更大。
    正由于抓落后是具有这样深刻的意义，因此落后面转变得好不好，就成为当前社会主义竞赛运动中一个重要的环节了。落后的能不能赶上先进，也就成为测量整改工作深不深透不透的一个方面了。
    长辛店车辆厂落后工人纷纷转变的事实，给当前企业的深入整改提出了一个重要问题。整风运动，特别是工农业生产大跃进的新形势，深深地打动了落后工人的心，许多人都感到不能再继续落后下去了，都表示要克服缺点，迎头赶上。紧紧抓住这个大好时机，把企业的每个成员都提高到先进的水平，这是当前企业领导者一件不可忽视的工作。
