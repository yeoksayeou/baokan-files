Xinhua News Agency, Ruijin, March 24th: Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered an important speech on the current work of the Communist Youth League at an observation and study meeting of the Communist Youth League work in one hundred counties in the four provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong.

Hu Yaobang said that in the past six months, the work of the Communist Youth League has greatly enlivened. Everyone has become more clear-headed about how to build socialism, and their spirits have been further liberated. Now the work of the whole country and the whole party is undergoing an unprecedented great leap forward. Some work has surpassed the achievements of several years in a very short period of time. This once again proves that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have been advocating for many years the implementation of overall planning, the unleashing of the masses, and the adoption of the socialist construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, which is completely correct.

Hu Yaobang said that although our achievements are the main aspect, because our thinking often lags behind reality, much work is not done well enough. There are still some things that can be done but have not been done; some things can be done faster; some things can be done better; some things can be done more thoroughly. The reason for this is that some cadres, when carrying out their work, often have these four concerns: First, they worry whether the masses can be mobilized; second, they worry whether it conforms to the instructions and regulations of their superiors; third, they worry whether it will hinder the central work; and fourth, they worry that they lack experience and will not do the work well. Therefore, they often hesitate and wait.

Hu Yaobang then gave a detailed analysis of the above four concerns. He said that in any place and at any time, the masses have three states: advanced, intermediate, and backward. Therefore, people generally have three attitudes towards various tasks of socialist construction: some advocate quick action, some advocate slow action, and some even advocate no action. The responsibility of leaders is to distinguish between advanced opinions and backward opinions, and to distinguish between the opinions of the majority and the opinions of the minority. We should start from advanced thinking and represent the majority, and not be misled by the backward remarks of a few. When a new thing appears, some people will definitely oppose it. Should we listen to the opinions of these people? Listening is necessary. Should we believe it? Not necessarily. Should we panic? Definitely not. If we listen, believe, panic, and get confused, then nothing will be accomplished. Another responsibility of leaders is to rely on the advanced, unite the intermediate, and persuade the backward.

Hu Yaobang also emphasized that Communist Youth League cadres should creatively implement the instructions of their superiors. He said that more, faster, better, and more economical is the most fundamental policy for building socialism, and it must not be violated. This point should be affirmed first. However, under this general policy and principle, some specific regulations and systems are allowed to be continuously supplemented and revised so that they are more in line with the constantly developing and changing objective reality. Therefore, League cadres should go deep into reality, investigate and study specific situations, and creatively carry out work by combining the instructions of their superiors with the conditions of their regions.

Will doing more and faster in the work of the League hinder the central work? Hu Yaobang said that the so-called central work refers to having a focus in a short period of time, with leaders and the masses concentrating their main efforts on running one or two things. This method of leadership is correct and necessary. However, our country is now in a situation of a great leap forward, and the work in various fields has increased and the tasks are heavy. Therefore, we cannot engage in "single combat." We must actively assist the Party in making achievements in various central tasks, and we must not hold a bystander's attitude of waiting. We must be good at actively selecting areas where our Communist Youth League can contribute, make plans, take measures, and produce results. Therefore, all League committees must have a set of methods, that is, most of the time they must obey the Party's central work, but every year they must also choose several tasks in which the Communist Youth League can particularly exert its strength, and spend a short period of time, or use the masses' production spare time, to do something. This can combine the central work with the League's independent activities. These activities are not only conducive to socialist construction, but also to cultivating and educating young people, and will not hinder the central work.

Regarding the problem of cadres lacking work experience, Hu Yaobang said that the practical way to do things well is good experience. Experience does not fall from the sky. Only by doing can we gain experience, increase talent, increase knowledge, learn vivid Marxism-Leninism, and become good cadres of the Party. Hu Yaobang called on League cadres to thoroughly eliminate all unhealthy ideological concerns, further emancipate their minds, dare to act, dare to advance, and be thorough proponents of progress.

Regarding how the current rural League work should adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward, Hu Yaobang put forward eight tasks with universality that the Communist Youth League can best contribute to: 1. Actively promote and participate in all agricultural capital construction movements, large and small, such as leveling land on plains, transforming low-yielding fields, and building hydropower stations, hydroelectric power stations, and roads in mountainous areas. 2. Carry out high-yield experimental activities in agriculture and sideline agricultural industries in many ways, and seize the link of experimentation to stir up a craze among the vast grassroots and youth to study technology. 3. Vigorously complete afforestation work, and actively develop the mountainous economy under the overall planning of the Party committee, combining the development of the mountainous economy with afforestation work. 4. Resolutely carry out the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests to the end. 5. Ensure that illiteracy among young people is basically eliminated within three years, and actively promote the popularization of private primary school education and the development of spare-time middle schools. 6. Do a good job in work-study programs, establish a set of systems and methods, and strive to turn scholarships into self-study funds within two or three years. 7. Improve the work of the Young Pioneers. 8. Actively promote Mandarin Chinese.

Hu Yaobang also gave important instructions on the work style and working methods of Communist Youth League cadres. He pointed out that League cadres should have two kinds of revolutionary integrity, two types of struggle knowledge, and two sets of working methods. He said that the so-called two kinds of revolutionary integrity are: first, to establish revolutionary ambition, to be full of ambition and full of energy, and to be sure to make achievements in the work of the League. Second, to have revolutionary courage, not to be timid and small-handed, but to let go and mobilize the masses, and to be bold in doing things. The so-called two types of knowledge: one type is the knowledge of production struggle, that is, to understand the actual production and production experience. But having only production knowledge and production experience is not enough; we must also have political work experience. In terms of production experience, we should advocate that League cadres study and delve into production knowledge, understand the production process of local major crops and major products, and understand the scientific knowledge and advanced experience of these things. How to obtain this kind of knowledge? "Five togethers" is a very good method, and sending cadres to the grassroots for training is also a good method. But they can only be sent to the grassroots in batches and rotations, and it is impossible for everyone to go. Therefore, we must advocate the method of learning while doing. We should specialize in various production knowledge one by one. In terms of political work experience, we must learn to be good at understanding the masses, organizing the masses, and inspiring the masses. In addition to doing work, we must also read some books and develop the habit of reading newspapers. The so-called two sets of methods, one set of methods is "squatting" and "running circles," going deep into the investigation of the situation, and summarizing work experience. But just "squatting" is not enough, we should also "run circles" to check the work everywhere. The other set of methods is "grabbing" and "pushing," to be good at discovering the advanced, grasping typical experiences, and promoting them through meetings, observation, and other methods. Constantly grabbing typical examples and promoting typical experiences, grabbing and pushing again and again, repeatedly circulating, can effectively push the work forward.

    解放思想  大胆干  大胆前进
    胡耀邦号召共青团干部当彻底的促进派
    据新华社瑞金24日电　共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦在江西、湖南、福建、广东四省一百个县共青团工作观摩学习会上，对当前共青团工作做了重要讲话。
    胡耀邦说，最近半年来，共青团的工作大大地活跃起来。大家对如何建设社会主义，头脑更加清醒，精神上获得了进一步解放。现在全国全党的工作都有一个空前的大跃进，有些工作在很短时期内超过了几年的成就，这又一次证明了党中央和毛主席多年所讲的实行全面规划，放手发动群众，采取多、快、好、省的社会主义建设方针，是完全正确的。
    胡耀邦说，虽然我们的成绩是主要的，但是由于我们的思想往往落后于实际，许多工作还做得不够，还有些事情可以做而没有做；还有些事情可以做得更快些；有些事情可以做得更好些；有些事情可以做得更彻底一些。所以这样，这是因为有些干部在进行工作时，往往还存在这么四个顾虑：一是顾虑群众是不是可以发动起来；二是顾虑符合不符合上级的指示、规章；三是顾虑会不会妨碍中心工作；四是顾虑自己没有经验，工作做不好。因而往往产生犹豫等待。
    胡耀邦接着针对上述四种顾虑，分别做了详尽的分析。他说，任何地方，任何时候，群众都有先进、中间和落后的三种状态，因此人们对社会主义建设的各项工作大体上也有三种态度：有的主张快干，有的主张慢干，有的甚至主张不干。领导者的责任，就是要分清先进的意见还是落后的意见，要分清是多数人的意见还是少数人的意见。我们应该从先进的思想出发，代表大多数，不要被少数的落后的言论所迷惑。当一件新事物的出现，一定会有些人反对。对于这些人的意见，听不听呢？听是要听一下。信不信呢？信就不一定。慌不慌呢？一定不要慌。如果一听、二信、三慌、四乱，那就什么事也干不成。领导者的另一责任，就是依靠那些先进的，团结那些中间的，说服那些落后的。
    胡耀邦还强调指出，共青团干部要创造性地执行上级的指示。他说，多、快、好、省是建设社会主义最根本的方针，绝不能违反，这一点应该首先肯定。但在这个总的方针原则下，一些具体的规章、制度是允许不断地补充和修正的，使它更加符合不断发展变化的客观实际。因此，团的干部应该深入实际，调查研究具体情况，把上级的指示，结合本地区的情况，创造性地进行工作。
    团的工作做得多，做得快，会不会妨碍中心工作？胡耀邦说，所谓中心工作，是指在一个短时期内，有一个重心，领导和群众集中主要精力去兴办一两件事情，这种领导方法是正确的、必要的。但现在我们国家处在大跃进形势下，各方面工作增多了，任务很重，因此，不能单打一。我们要积极地协助党在各项中心工作中做出成绩来，决不能抱着旁观等待的态度，要善于主动地选择我们青年团能够出力的地方订出规划，拿出措施，做出效果。因此各个团委都要有一套办法，就是平时大部分时间要服从党的中心工作，但每年也要选择几件共青团能够特别发挥力量的工作，用较短的时间，或者用群众的生产空隙时间，干些事情，这就可以把中心工作和团的独立活动结合起来。这些活动既有利于社会主义建设，又有利于培养教育青年，是不会妨碍中心工作的。
    关于干部缺乏工作经验问题，胡耀邦说，办好事情的实际办法就是好经验，经验不是从天上掉下来的。只有干，才能取得经验，才能增加才能，才能增长知识，才能学到生动的马列主义，才能成为党的好干部。胡耀邦号召团的干部要彻底地消除一切不健康的思想顾虑，进一步解放思想，大胆干，大胆前进，当个彻底的促进派。
    对当前农村团的工作如何适应大跃进的新形势，胡耀邦提出了八项带有普遍性的而共青团又最能出力的工作：一、要积极地推动和参加一切大小平原平整土地，改造低产田和山区兴建水力站、水电站和修筑道路的农业基本建设运动。二、多方面开展农业和农副业的高额丰产试验活动，并且抓住试验这一环，来鼓起广大基层和青年钻研技术的热潮。三、大力完成绿化工作，并且在党委整个规划下，积极开发山区经济，把开发山区经济和绿化工作结合起来。四、坚决把以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动进行到底。五、要确保在三年内基本上扫除青年中的文盲，并且要积极地促进普及民办小学教育和发展业余中学。六、做好勤工俭学工作，建立起一套制度和办法，争取在二、三年内变助学金为自学金。七、改进少先队的工作。八、积极推广普通话。
    胡耀邦对共青团干部的工作作风和工作方法问题，也做了重要指示。他指出，团的干部应该有两副革命正气，两类斗争知识，两套工作办法。他说，所谓两副革命正气，就是：一要树立革命的志气，志气昂扬，干劲十足，一定要把团的工作干出成绩。二要具有革命的勇气，不要畏首畏尾，小手小脚，要放手发动群众，大胆地干。所谓两类知识：一类是生产斗争知识，也就是要懂得生产实际和生产经验。但是只有生产知识和生产经验是不够的，还要有政治工作经验。在生产经验方面，要提倡团干部学习钻研生产知识，要懂得当地主要作物和主要产品的生产过程，要懂得这些东西的科学知识和先进经验。怎样得到这类知识呢？“五同”是个很好的办法，干部下放锻炼也是个好办法。但只能分期分批轮流下放，不可能都去。因此，我们要提倡边干边学的办法。对各种生产知识应该一门一类地专门深入地钻研一下。在政治工作经验方面，要学会善于了解群众，组织群众和鼓舞群众的才能。除做工作外，还要读些书，养成读报的习惯。所谓两套办法，一套办法是“蹲点”和“跑圈”，深入调查情况，总结工作经验，但只是“蹲点”还不够，还应该“跑圈”，到各处检查工作。另一套办法是“抓”和“推”，要善于发现先进，抓住典型经验，通过会议、观摩等各种方式进行推广。不断抓典型，推广典型经验，这样一抓一推，推了再抓，反复循环，就能够有效地把工作推向前进。
