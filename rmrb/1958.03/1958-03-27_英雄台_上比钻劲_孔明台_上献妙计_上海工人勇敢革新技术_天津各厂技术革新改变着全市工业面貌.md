Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th. Xinhua News Agency reporter He Changhua reports: The movement for Shanghai factories to compete in advanced practices and in achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results has seen new developments, and a mass technical innovation upsurge is taking shape. Currently, the trend of the movement is rapidly shifting from comparing targets and enthusiasm to comparing wisdom, drilling skills, measures, tackling key problems, offering rationalization proposals, and learning from advanced experiences.

Some time ago, workers in many factories proposed a large number of targets for compressing work-hour quotas and guarantees on the "Hero Stage" where they competed in enthusiasm. Now, they have transformed this arena into a "Zhuge Liang Stage," each contributing clever plans to complete new tasks. The Xin'an Electric Motor Factory's output target for this year is six times higher than last year, requiring an increase of two to three hundred people. After the workers proposed a guarantee of compressing more than 600,000 work-hours without adding a single person on the "Hero Stage," they have already proposed more than three hundred rationalization proposals in a short period, of which more than one hundred have been processed and implemented. Many old-fashioned belt lathes that originally could only rotate at more than five hundred revolutions per minute are being converted by workers to more than a thousand revolutions, preparing them for high-speed cutting. Employees of Hengxin Machinery Factory contributed more than eighty ingenious plans to improve machinery and equipment and improve operations at a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" overnight. Implementing these improvements can compress more than 270,000 work-hours.

Many relatively important technical innovations have also emerged one after another. Employees of the Shanghai Silk Spinning Factory successfully created the "hot-pressing degumming method," changing the old method of using hot water to boil "waste cocoons," which had been used in silk industry refining workshops for fifty years, to steaming them in a sealed steam bucket. The new method can increase production by four times, increase the silk yield by 20%, and save 30% of labor. The iron and steel industry sector has recently broken with convention and successfully tested a number of new technologies—double-layer steel baking method, thirteen-pass steel rolling method, etc., greatly leveraging the potential of existing equipment. The competition to strive for the world's most advanced level of offset color printing is being carried out fiercely in printing factories these days, with the highest being the 400-line screen density just achieved by the Shanghai No. 1 Printing Factory on the 25th. The printed pictures are almost identical to those painted by artists.

Advanced production indicators have also prompted workers to further understand the principle that they must use their brains and cannot just rely on physical strength. Therefore, they have put forward many good methods that are both labor-saving and can complete new tasks.

Mass technical innovation has broken through many old rules and regulations and has also promoted the improvement of leadership work. In particular, the handling of rationalization proposals, the old methods are no longer able to adapt to the new situation of a large number of rationalization proposals emerging. Therefore, factories such as Zhongnan Electric Motor Factory and Xin'an Electric Motor Factory have decentralized the power of processing to workshops and work sections. Some proposals involving product quality and large expenditures are handled by the factory level. At the factory level, some factories have also established "Rapid Rationalization Proposal Processing Committees" to ensure that they are reviewed and approved immediately. In the past, it took one to two months for a proposal from Xin'an Electric Motor Factory to be approved. Now, it is resolved the next day.

People's Daily, Tianjin, March 26th. A mass technical innovation movement has emerged in many factories and enterprises in Tianjin.

The earliest and currently most valued is the activity of Wang Shutian, a fitter at the North China Sewing Machine Factory, to innovate technology in a complete set. He put forward a heroic plan: to innovate twenty-five technologies and complete nine years and four and a half months of work in one year. So far, eleven items have been implemented, and he is stepping up his efforts to complete all these technical innovation attempts before May Day. Wang Shutian's technical innovations include improving existing tools, replacing manual operations with machines, reducing process steps, and so on. His revolutionary actions have had a good impact on the great leap forward in sewing machine production throughout the factory. All the workers in the factory have risen to catch up, learn from Wang Shutian's example, and reform the production technology of other parts to fully ensure the completion of the leap forward plan. This factory plans to produce 60,000 sewing machines this year, which will exceed the total number of sewing machines produced in the five years since the factory was built in 1953.

The Tianjin Bicycle Factory, famous for producing "Flying Pigeon" bicycles, also plans to increase its output by nearly double this year compared to last year. The crucial pipe drawing section only increased its output by 20% in February compared to December last year, which seriously failed to meet the needs of the factory's leap forward. Recently, after the workers in this section conducted research, they made an important tool reform, so that the pipe drawing machine, which could only draw one pipe at a time, can now draw two pipes at the same time, immediately increasing the output by nearly double.

The Tianjin Tractor Factory, which plans to produce 22,000 gas generators this year, four times more than last year's output, is facing a situation where the casting workshop, which produces the main components of the gas generators, is still operating manually. This not only fails to meet the needs of the machining workshop, but also has poor quality and a high scrap rate, which affects the completion of the entire production plan. In order to solve this problem, the factory has adopted technical reforms to realize semi-mechanization or complete mechanization of molding and casting, which can increase output by one to two times.

The fitter group 2 of the third workshop of the joint state-private Baosheng Machine Factory has launched a new upsurge of everyone improving technology, implementing the method of "one person proposes a problem, everyone contributes ideas" to gather the strength of the masses. In less than a month, they have improved twenty-seven tools, achieving new production every day. The planned output value of the whole group was originally 80% higher than last year, but now it has jumped to 212%. The development of this mass technology improvement activity and the emergence of the budding technical revolution are the inevitable results and urgent requirements after the rectification campaign and the great leap forward in production. Now, the party and government leading departments in Tianjin attach great importance to this new revolutionary budding and are planning to vigorously cultivate it so that it can grow rapidly and healthily.

    “英雄台”上比钻劲　“孔明台”上献妙计
    上海工人勇敢革新技术
    天津各厂技术革新改变着全市工业面貌
    据新华社上海26日电　新华社记者贺昌华报道：上海工厂比先进、比多快好省运动有了新的发展，一个群众性的技术革新热潮正在形成。目前，运动发展的趋势从比指标、比干劲，迅速转入了比智慧、比钻劲、比措施、比攻关键、比提合理化建议、比学先进经验。
    许多工厂的工人前些时候在比干劲的“英雄台”上，提出了大量压缩工时定额的指标和保证；现在他们就把这个擂台改成了“诸葛亮台”，各献锦囊妙计，来完成新任务。新安电机厂今年产量指标比去年增长六倍，需要增加二、三百人；工人在“英雄台”上提出了压缩六十多万工时、不要增加一个人的保证以后，在短短时间内已经提出三百多条合理化建议，其中有一百多条已经处理和实现了。不少原来每分钟只能转五百多转的老式皮带车床，正在被工人们改为一千多转，准备用来进行高速切削。恒新机器厂职工，一夜功夫就在“诸葛亮会”上献出了八十多条改进机器设备、改进操作的妙计，实现这些改进可以压缩二十七万多工时。
    很多比较重要的技术革新也纷纷出现了。上海绢纺厂职工创造成功了“热压脱胶法”，把丝绸工业精炼车间五十年来一向采用的用热水煮“下脚茧”的老方法，改为放在密封的蒸桶里蒸。新方法能使产量提高四倍，出绵率提高20％，节省人工30％。钢铁工业部门最近打破陈规，试验成功多项新技术——双层烘钢法、十三道轧钢法等，大大发挥了原有设备的潜力。争取胶版彩印达到世界最先进水平的竞赛，这几天在印刷工厂中进行得很激烈，而以上海市印刷一厂25日刚达到的网线密度四百线为最高，印出的图片简直跟画家画出来的一样。
    先进的生产指标，也促使工人们进一步懂得了必须动脑筋、不能光拼体力的道理。因此，他们提出了许多既省力、又能完成新任务的好办法。
    群众性的技术革新，冲破了许多旧的规章制度，也推动了领导工作的改进。特别是合理化建议的处理，老办法已不能适应目前合理化建议大量出现的新情况。于是，中南电机厂、新安电机厂等厂便把处理的权力，下放到车间、工段去。一些牵涉到产品质量和花费较大的建议，才由厂一级处理。而在厂一级，有的厂也成立了“合理化建议迅速处理委员会”，做到随阅随批。新安电机厂过去一个建议要一、两个月才能批下去，现在第二天就解决了。
    本报天津26日电　在天津市的许多工厂企业里，出现了群众性的技术革新运动。
    出现较早当前又最受人们重视的，要算华北缝纫机厂钳工王叔田成套地革新技术的活动。他提出了一项英雄式的计划：革新二十五项技术，一年完成九年零四个半月的工作量。到目前为止，已经实现了十一项，他正加紧努力，争取在“五一”以前，全部完成这些技术革新的尝试。王叔田的技术革新包括对现有工具的改进、以机器代替人力操作、减少工艺过程等等。他的革命行动对全厂缝纫机生产的大跃进起了良好的影响，全厂工人都已奋起直追，学习王叔田的榜样，改革其他零件的生产技术，以全面保证跃进计划的完成。这个厂今年计划生产缝纫机六万台，将超过从1953年建厂五年以来所产缝纫机的总和。
    以生产“飞鸽牌”自行车而驰名的天津自行车厂，今年的产量计划也比去年提高将近一倍。带有关键性的拔管工段，2月份产量仅比去年12月提高20％，这就严重地不能满足全厂跃进的需要。最近这个工段的工人进行钻研以后，作了一项重要的工具改革，使原来每次只能拔一根管子的拔管机，现在能同时拔两根，一下子就使产量增加近一倍。
    比去年产量提高四倍、计划生产二万二千台煤气机的天津拖拉机制造厂，由于生产煤气机主要部件的铸工车间还是手工操作，本来就赶不上加工车间的需要，再加上质量不好报废率很高，以致影响整个生产计划的完成。为了解决这一问题，这个厂已在采取技术改革，使造型和浇铸实现半机械化或完全机械化，可提高产量一倍到两倍。
    公私合营宝生机器厂三车间钳工二组掀起了人人改进技术的新高潮，实行“一个人提题，大家出主意”的群策群力的方法，不到一个月的时间已改进了二十七件工具，作到了生产日日新。全组的产值原计划比去年提高80％，现在一跃而为212％。这个群众性的改进技术活动的开展，技术革命萌芽的出现，正是整风和生产大跃进以后的必然结果和十分迫切的要求。现在，天津市的党政领导部门对这一新的革命萌芽极为珍视，正计划大力培养使它迅速而茁壮地生长起来。（附图片）
