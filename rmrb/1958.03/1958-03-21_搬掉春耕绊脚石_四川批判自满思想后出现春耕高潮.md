Removing the Stumbling Block to Spring Plowing
Sichuan Sees a Spring Plowing Upsurge After Criticizing Complacency

(By our newspaper) As the busy season of spring plowing approaches, Sichuan is strengthening its political and ideological work, criticizing conservative and complacent thinking, and laying an ideological foundation for welcoming the spring production upsurge.

Sichuan Province has already achieved brilliant results in winter production. By the beginning of this month, water conservancy projects completed throughout the province had increased the irrigated area by 16 million mu, improved soil by more than 13 million mu, maintained soil and water over an area of more than 10.01 million mu, and accumulated fertilizer averaging more than 10,000 jin per mu of cultivated land. Under such circumstances, some cadres and the masses developed lax and complacent ideas. On the other hand, some cadres and the masses still lack confidence in the Great Leap Forward and are skeptical of advanced production technologies. According to surveys in Neijiang, Nanchong, and other districts, it is estimated that such cadres and the masses account for about 10%, and in some places, 15%. In areas where conservative thinking is more serious, there have been varying degrees of insufficient preparation of spring plowing materials, a lack of seriousness in implementing increased production technologies, and conservative production plans. In some places in the Fuling District, due to the blind complacency of cadres and the masses, they did not pay attention to the storage of seeds, and only when they needed them did they find that there were not enough. Members of the Qiyi Cooperative in Liangjia Township, Jiangjin County, believed that "we were busy enough last winter, and spring plowing is still early," so more than 20 members went out to visit relatives and friends, and many people sat at home doing nothing. The cooperative's attendance rate dropped from 90% to more than 70%.

In response to these situations, in addition to continuing to use methods such as "do what, debate what" and organizing visits to continuously criticize conservative and complacent thinking, various places have also launched a large-scale publicity campaign in rural areas for the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. All districts or counties have focused on criticizing various conservative ideas at spring plowing production cadre meetings. Yibin, Neijiang, Nanchong and other districts have successively organized district and county party secretaries to visit and compare notes in various counties, and learn from advanced experiences.

According to analyses in various places, the reason why some cadres and the masses have various conservative ideas is mainly because they lack sufficient understanding of the call to "work hard for three years to change the backward face of our country," and are accustomed to looking at problems from the economic conditions of small-scale agricultural production. Therefore, they do not believe in new things and easily become complacent once they have achieved results. Therefore, when criticizing these conservative ideas, various places have fully utilized the large number of facts that have emerged in various parts of the province in the past few years in implementing the Agricultural Development Program, especially the production achievements and long-term plans since last winter, to conduct education, and at the same time organize visits to introduce experiences. This not only solved ideological problems, but also explained methods, which has been very effective.

At present, the province's production upsurge is developing wave after wave. In places where winter production has progressed rapidly, the broad masses of farmers immediately put themselves into spring plowing after completing water conservancy projects, and in many places, water conservancy construction and spring plowing are proceeding simultaneously. Fushun County, the first county in the province to achieve water conservancy in paddy fields, immediately shifted its efforts to transforming low-yield fields and expanding irrigation of dry land after solving the problem of conservative complacency, and spring plowing also started early.

### 搬掉春耕绊脚石  四川批判自满思想后出现春耕高潮

    搬掉春耕绊脚石
    四川批判自满思想后出现春耕高潮
    本报讯　在春耕繁忙季节即将到来之前，四川各地正在加强政治思想工作，批判保守自满思想，为迎接春季生产高潮打下思想基础。
    四川省冬季生产已经取得辉煌成就。到本月上旬，全省已完成的水利工程增加灌溉面积达一千六百万亩，改良土壤一千三百多万亩，水土保持面积一千零一十多万亩，积肥平均每亩耕地达到一万多斤。在这样的形势下面，部分干部和群众产生了松劲自满思想。另一方面，也还有部分干部和群众对大跃进缺乏信心、对先进生产技术抱怀疑态度。据内江、南充等专区调查估计，这类干部和群众约占10％左右，有的地方占15％。在保守思想较严重的地方，出现了程度不同的春耕物资准备不足、贯彻增产技术不认真、生产计划保守等现象。涪陵专区有的地方由于干部、群众盲目自满，不注意保管种籽，用种时才发现不够。江津县梁家乡七一社的社员们认为“去年冬天忙够了，春耕还早”，有二十多个社员出外串亲游逛，不少人坐在家里不做活，全社出工率由90％下降到70％多。
    根据这些情况，各地除了继续采用“做什么，辩论什么”，及组织参观等方法不断批判保守自满思想以外，还在农村中开展了一次大规模的全国农业发展纲要修正草案的宣传活动。各专区或县都在春耕生产干部会上，集中地批判了各种保守思想。宜宾、内江、南充等专区都先后组织全区县委书记到各县去参观评比和学习先进经验。
    据各地分析，某些干部和群众所以有各式各样的保守思想，主要是由于对“苦战三年改变我国落后面貌”的号召缺乏足够的认识，习惯于从小农生产的经济条件出发来看问题，因而对新事物不相信，一有了成绩便易于自满。因此，各地在批判这些保守思想的时候，充分运用了全省各地过去几年在实现农业发展纲要方面出现的大量事实，特别是去冬以来的生产成就和远景规划进行教育，同时组织参观，介绍经验。这样既解决了思想问题，又交代了方法，收效很大。
    目前，全省生产高潮正一浪接一浪地向前发展。冬季生产进展快的地方，广大农民修完水利马上就投入了春耕，许多地方修水利和春耕同时并进。全省第一个实现水田水利化的富顺县，在解决了保守自满思想以后，立刻把力量转到改造低产田和扩大旱地灌溉面积上去，春耕也提早开始了。（新华社专稿）
