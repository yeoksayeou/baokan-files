Editor's Notes:

    Eliminate Backwardness!
    Looking at wheat fields in a county, a province, or even the whole country, second and third-class wheat fields are in the minority, only a few percent or ten percent. However, if we add up the second and third-class wheat fields in each county and each province, that would be a remarkable large number! Therefore, it is of great significance that Jiangsu farmers are carrying out a "Three Wheat Crash Month" campaign to eliminate second and third-class wheat fields.
    The existence of second and third-class wheat fields is a sign of backwardness in our work, and we should eliminate it.

    消灭落后！
    从一个县、一个省甚至全国的麦田看来，二、三类麦田是少数，不过百分之几或十几。但是，我们试把各个县、各个省的二、三类麦田都加起来，那就是一个了不起的大数字！因此，江苏农民开展培植三麦突击月，决心消灭二、三类麦田，是有很大意义的。
    二、三类麦田的存在，就标志着工作上的落后，我们应该消灭它。
