    Relatives Return Before Our Eyes
    —Welcoming the Return of the Volunteers
    Zang Kejia
        (I) Eight years, ah, eight years of time! You were not before our eyes, but you were in our hearts. Eight years, ah, eight years of time! Extinguishing the arrogance of the invaders, look, the picturesque rivers and mountains of our fraternal country!
        (II) When you went abroad, it was like a gust of wind, carrying the righteousness of the Chinese people, rushing to the fiery Yalu River. The spring grass is green, the spring flowers are red, hundreds of birds accompany the singing of the Great Leap Forward, heroic soldiers, you have returned to the motherland, the motherland, welcomes you with a brand-new look.
        (III) If you see the time of fighting against a common enemy, that kind of spirit of sharing life and death, you will understand why these two soldiers, at the time of parting, embraced so tightly, tightly. What is embraced are two bodies, what is embraced are hundreds of millions of people, China and Korea, Korea and China, embrace forever, never to be separated!
        (IV) Plant this pine tree here, leaving the best souvenir, we once fought side by side with Korean brothers on this land. The pine tree will never wither, just like our friendship, the pine tree grows year after year, green, like our remembrance.

    亲人回到了我们眼前
    ——欢迎志愿军归国
    臧克家
        （一）八年了呵，八年的时光！你们不在我们眼前却在我们的心上。八年了呵，八年的时间！扑灭了侵略者的气焰，看，兄弟之邦如画的江山！
        （二）你们出国的时候，像一阵劲风，带着中国人民的义气，奔向战火腾腾的鸭绿江东。春草正绿，春花正红，百鸟伴奏着大跃进的歌声，英雄的战士呵，你们回到了
  祖国，祖国，用崭新的面貌把你们
  欢迎。
        （三）你看见对共同敌人作战的时
  光，那种生死与共的精神，你就会明白这两位战士，临别时候，为什么拥抱得这
  么紧，紧。拥抱的是两条身子，拥抱的是几万万人民，中国朝鲜，朝鲜中国，永远拥抱，永远不离分！
        （四）把这棵松树栽在这里，留下一个最好的纪念，我们曾经在这片土地上，和朝鲜弟兄并肩作战。松树永远不会雕谢，就像我们的友情一般，松树一年又一年生长，青青的，像我们的怀念。
