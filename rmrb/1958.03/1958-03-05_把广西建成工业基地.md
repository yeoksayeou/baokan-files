Build Guangxi into an Industrial Base
Jiang Pingqiu, Director of the Guangxi Industrial Bureau

Over the past eight years, Guangxi's industry has seen considerable development. In these eight years, 325 new factories and mines have been built, and 93 factories and mines have been renovated. By the end of 1957, the region had 541 independently accounted industrial enterprises. Among them, 24 had more than 500 employees. In 1957, the total number of employees in industrial enterprises across the region increased to 84,994. The total industrial output value in 1957 increased elevenfold compared to 1950, with local industry growing by 8.2 times. The variety of industrial and handicraft products increased by more than 1,000. The quality of many products, such as zinc oxide powder, gasoline engines, and rosin, has reached national standards. Although industrial construction has made significant achievements in recent years, it still cannot keep up with the needs of the developing situation, which requires industry to speed up and catch up.

According to preliminary plans, the total output value of Guangxi's local industry will reach 3.4 billion yuan in 1962, which is 6.6 times that of 1957, with an average annual increase of 45.7%. In 1962, local industry will account for 47.77% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. This makes it possible to catch up with and surpass agriculture within six years.

According to the central government's guidelines and Guangxi's specific conditions, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, pig iron production will increase by 153 times, electricity by 27 times, coal by 6 times, sugar by 26 times, machine-made paper by 202 times, and gold by 35 times. According to this plan, we will strive to build Guangxi into one of the industrial bases for the iron and steel industry, chemical fertilizer industry, coal industry, non-ferrous metal industry, machinery industry, sugar industry, and paper industry in five years or a little longer.

Guangxi is extremely rich in industrial resources. According to current data, more than 40 kinds of mineral deposits have been discovered in the region. Manganese ore reserves are about 700 million tons, ranking first in the country. Tin ore reserves are over 300,000 tons, ranking second in the country. It can be said that Guangxi is full of treasures. Guangxi has numerous rivers and extremely rich water resources. If utilized for power generation, preliminary surveys show that there are more than 15 million kilowatts, which can be comprehensively utilized for flood control, irrigation, and the development of shipping.

The current task for Guangxi's industrial development is to use a revolutionary spirit of riding the wind and waves and striving for the upstream, mobilizing all positive factors, and organizing a great leap forward. The whole Party should take action, the entire people should take action, leaders at all levels should take action, all systems should take action, and everyone should run industry. We must face the countryside, closely integrate with agricultural production, and advocate that every county should run industry, every township should run industry, combine large, medium, and small enterprises, and focus on small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, we must fully leverage the potential of existing enterprises as a foundation. We must comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and make steady leaps forward.

    把广西建成工业基地
    广西工业厅厅长　江萍秋
    八年来，广西工业有了相当大的发展。在八年中全区新建厂矿三百二十五间，改建厂矿九十三间。截至1957年底，全区已经拥有独立核算工业企业五百四十一间。其中五百人以上的二十四间，1957年全区工业企业职工增加到八万四千九百九十四人。1957年工业总产值比1950年增长十一倍，其中地方工业增长八点二倍。工业和手工业产品品种共增加一千余种。不少产品质量，如锌氧粉、汽油机、松香等都达到了国家标准。几年来，工业建设虽然取得了不小成绩，但还是赶不上形势发展的需要，这就要求工业快马加鞭赶上去。
    根据初步规划，1962年广西地方工业总产值将达到三十四亿元，为1957年的六点六倍，每年平均递增45.7％。1962年地方工业将占工农业总产值的47.77％。这就有可能在六年内赶上和超过农业。
    根据中央的方针和广西的具体条件，在第二个五年计划期间，生铁将增长一百五十三倍，电力二十七倍，煤炭六倍，糖二十六倍，机制纸二百零二倍，黄金三十五倍。按照这个计划，就是争取用五年或者更多一点时间，逐步把广西建设成为钢铁工业、化学肥料工业、煤炭工业、有色金属工业、机械工业、制糖工业和造纸工业的工业基地之一。
    广西工业资源极为丰富。就现在的资料看来，全区已发现有各种矿藏四十多种。锰矿储量约七亿吨左右，居全国第一位。锡矿储量在三十万吨以上，居全国第二位，可以说广西遍地是宝。广西河川纵横，水力资源极为丰富，如利用起来发电，经初步勘查的就有一千五百万瓩以上，并可综合利用，防洪、灌溉、发展航运。
    广西发展工业的当前任务，就是要用乘风破浪、力争上游的革命精神，调动一切积极因素，组织大跃进。全党动手，全民动手，各级领导动手，各系统动手，大家办工业。面向农村，与农业生产密切结合，提倡县县办工业，乡乡办工业，大小中结合，以中小为主。同时充分发挥原有企业的潜力，作为依托。全面贯彻执行多、快、好、省的方针，稳步跃进。
