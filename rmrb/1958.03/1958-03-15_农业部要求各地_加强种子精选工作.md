Xinhua News Agency, 14th - The nationwide inter-provincial seed transfer work is nearing completion. The Ministry of Agriculture requires all regions to immediately strengthen seed selection work.

    In order to meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, between the end of last year and January and February of this year, provinces have transferred more than 520 million jin of rice, dry rice, spring wheat, corn, broad beans, peas, soybeans and various miscellaneous grain crop seeds, and more than 111.19 million jin of potato crop seeds. The seeds transferred in January and February alone this year (excluding potato crops) increased by 12.5 times compared to the first quarter of last year, and more than 32% compared to the entire year of last year. The seeds required for the conversion of 14 million mu of rice in Hunan and Hubei provinces (single-season to double-season, Indica rice to Japonica rice) have been transferred from ten provinces and cities including Guangdong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang. Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Beijing and other provinces and cities have greatly increased the area of paddy fields this year, and have transferred a total of more than 130 million jin of rice seeds. Hebei Province has also basically solved the spring wheat seed it needs to increase the multiple cropping index.
    After the transfer, the quantity of seeds can generally meet the needs. However, since the vast majority of seeds are selected from within the grain depots, some seeds are of poor quality, and according to tests, have a low germination rate; furthermore, some of the rice and spring wheat seeds are mixed and impure. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture issued a telegram a few days ago, requiring all provinces to focus on seed selection work, and to resolutely select seeds by grain where possible, to ensure increased production. All localities must lead agricultural cooperatives to plant the best seeds in seed plots for propagation to meet the needs of the coming year. In addition, for areas that have transferred in rice seeds, which are new varieties to the local area, it is necessary to help farmers become familiar with their habits and strengthen technical guidance during the production process, so as not to affect increased production.

### 农业部要求各地  加强种子精选工作

    农业部要求各地
    加强种子精选工作
    新华社1 4日讯　全国省与省间的种子调剂工作已经接近尾声，农业部要求各地立即加强种子精选工作。
    为了满足农业生产大跃进的需要，去年年底和今年1、2月间，省与省间已经调剂了五亿二千多万斤水稻、旱稻、春麦、玉米、蚕豆、豌豆、大豆和各种杂粮作物的种子，和一亿一千一百九十多万斤薯类作物种子。仅今年1、2 两月调剂的种子（不包括薯类作物），就比去年第一季度增加十二点五倍，比去年全年增加32％以上。湖南、湖北两省一千四百万亩水稻改制（单季改双季、籼稻改粳稻）所需的种子，已由广东、四川、浙江等十个省市调进。山东、河南、安徽、江苏和北京等省市，今年增加很多水田，共计调进水稻种子一亿三千多万斤。河北省为了增加复种指数，所需春麦种子也已基本解决。
    经过调剂后，种子数量一般已能满足需要。但是，由于绝大部分种子是由粮库内挑选出来的，有些种子质量较差，据试验，发芽率较低；还有一部分水稻和春麦种子，品种混杂不纯。因此农业部在前几天发出电报，要求各省抓紧种子精选工作，能够粒选的要坚决粒选，以保证增产。各地要领导农业社把最好的种子种在种子地内，进行繁育，以满足下年需要。另外，凡是调进水稻种子的地区，对当地来说是新品种的，都需要帮助农民熟悉它的习性，在生产过程中加强技术指导，以免影响增产。
