Seeing Once Is Better Than Hearing a Hundred Times

	We have a saying in China: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." This is a truth when it comes to human understanding. When we carry out various tasks, the methods of using visits and exhibitions are in line with the principle of "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times."
	Currently, the methods of visits and exhibitions have been promoted relatively widely in many regions across the country. Organizing cadres and the masses to visit and learn from advanced regions and units is becoming a trend not only within a province or city but also between provinces and cities. Some neighboring areas have established a system of regularly sending delegations to visit each other. Through various visits and exhibitions, advanced experiences have been promoted, and mutual competition has been encouraged. During the winter-spring water conservancy construction campaign, many regions compared themselves with advanced regions and immediately sped up their efforts to catch up, making the development of the campaign surge wave upon wave, one upsurge after another. In the recent struggle against waste and conservatism, the role of visits and exhibitions has also been very significant. The achievements made by Shanghai in promoting the advanced experience of State-owned Cotton Factory No. 12 and Beijing in promoting the advanced experience of Tianqiao Department Store are two prominent examples. From last winter to the present, Hubei Province has had more than 500 instances of counties, cities, and above-level units sending delegations to visit each other, with nearly two million cadres and masses participating. Through such large-scale visits, the experience of Xiangyang Prefecture in relying on the masses to build water conservancy projects, the experience of leading cadres in Hong'an County in planting "experimental plots," the experience of Macheng County in urban areas supporting rural areas, and the experience of Paomagang Township in Dangyang County in improving tools and increasing work efficiency during water conservancy construction have all been rapidly promoted. These vivid examples powerfully prove that organizing visits and exhibitions is a leadership method that adapts to the current situation of the Great Leap Forward.
	Why can organizing visits and exhibitions generate such tremendous power? This is because people's understanding always lags behind the development of objective things. For new things, there will always be people who do not believe them or understand them. What should be done? If you don't let them see for themselves and conduct their own investigations, even if you say it a hundred times, and they hear it a hundred times, you may not be able to make them believe it or understand it. The scale of water management in Anhui is so large that within a few months, a task of 800 million cubic meters and then another task of 800 million cubic meters were successively broken through, and now the third 800 million cubic meters has been completed. The newspapers have publicized it, and the higher authorities have also said it, but some people just don't believe it, saying, how can there be such a "miracle"? Later, many people went to see it for themselves and investigated it, and their doubts were dispelled. It is truly "seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." "See clearly, remember clearly, change your mind quickly, and learn the methods truly," these words are vivid comments from many cadres and masses on the two methods of visits and exhibitions.
	Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "The process of cognition, first, is to begin to contact external things, belonging to the stage of sensation. Second, is to synthesize the sensory materials to organize and transform them, belonging to the stage of concepts, judgments, and reasoning. Only when the sensory materials are very rich (not fragmented and incomplete) and consistent with reality (not illusions) can correct concepts and theories be created based on such materials." This passage talks about the problem of the materialist theory of knowledge, and it has great practical significance for guiding us on how to improve leadership methods and working methods. The human brain can only do processing work; raw materials and semi-finished products come from objective reality and from the masses. Separated from reality and separated from the masses, the brain can never create correct ideas. Therefore, when we lead any work, we must often go out of the office, go to the grassroots level for on-the-spot visits, conduct investigations and research, contact workers and peasants, absorb nourishment, and increase perceptual knowledge (some things must also be practiced directly—such as planting "experimental plots"). Only in this way can we obtain very rich and practical sensory materials, draw correct conclusions based on these materials, and then determine and implement practical guidelines and policies.
	When the leader has reached a correct conclusion after on-the-spot investigation or experimentation, only half of the matter is completed. The other half is how to enable the broad masses to also have this correct understanding and take action.
	The Party has always taught us that we must follow the mass line in doing any work, that is, to concentrate ideas from the masses and then persist in them among the masses. In the process of concentration and persistence, we must also adopt a method that combines general appeals with individual guidance. This principle has been repeatedly explained many times, and many comrades know it. However, to implement the Party's mass line, we also need to adapt to the current situation and find some specific forms. Visits and exhibitions are two such methods. To organize visits and exhibitions, leaders must be good at going deep into reality, deep into the masses, discovering advanced models, and conscientiously summarizing advanced experiences, concentrating the practical experience of the masses, and forming correct leadership opinions through research. This is coming from the masses. Organizing visits and exhibitions makes it easy to use advanced experience to universally guide the masses, so that it is accepted and persisted in by more masses. This is going to the masses. The methods of visits and exhibitions specifically embody the principles of resolutely relying on the masses, using the masses' own experience to educate the masses, using the advanced to drive the backward, and using the individual to drive the general. Using this method can also effectively eliminate officialdom and prevent and overcome the danger of bureaucratization of leading organs.
	At present, China's socialist construction is presenting a nationwide mass movement, and work in all areas is leaping forward on a very broad scale. In the past eight years, especially in the past two years, our socialist construction has achieved great achievements, many advanced models have emerged, much valuable experience has been accumulated, and in the recent period, more advanced examples have emerged in the nationwide upsurge of socialist construction. The question now is how to promote these advanced models most widely and to raise the intermediate and backward states to an advanced level in larger quantities. At this time, it is even more necessary to universally promote the methods of visits and exhibitions.
	In the current situation, paying attention to working methods has special importance. Whether it is a materialist, mass-line working method, or a subjective, bureaucratic working method, these are two fundamentally different working methods. The former is a method of promotion, which we must learn; the latter is a method of regression, which must be resolutely opposed. Visits and exhibitions are a materialist, mass-line working method that must be vigorously promoted. We must also strive to sum up experiences and lessons in practice and constantly create other working methods that are adapted to the new situation. This is an urgent and very important task.

### 百闻不如一见

    百闻不如一见
    我国有一句俗谚是“百闻不如一见”。这对于人的认识来说，是一个真理。我们在作各项工作的时候，采用参观和展览的方法，正好与“百闻不如一见”的道理相符合。
    现在，参观和展览的方法，已经在全国许多地区比较广泛地推行起来了。组织干部和群众到先进地区和先进单位参观学习，不仅在一个省市的范围以内，而且在省市与省市之间，正在成为一种风气。有些毗邻地区，已经建立了经常互派代表团参观访问的制度。通过各种各样的参观和展览的活动，推广了先进经验，鼓励了互相竞赛。在去冬今春兴修水利运动中，许多地区都拿先进地区来同自己比较，立即快马加鞭赶上去，使运动的发展一浪高过一浪，一个高潮接着一个高潮。在最近反浪费反保守的斗争中，参观和展览的作用也表现得非常显著。上海推广国棉十二厂和北京推广天桥百货商场先进经验所获得的成就，就是两个突出的例子。湖北省从去年冬季到目前为止，县、市以上单位相互派代表团进行参观访问的达五百多起，参加的各级干部和群众近二百万人。通过这样大规模的参观访问活动，这个省的襄阳专区依靠群众兴修水利的经验，红安县领导干部种“试验田”的经验，麻城县城镇支援农村的经验，当阳县跑马岗乡在兴修水利中改良工具提高工效的经验等等，都迅速地得到推广。这些生动的事例，有力地证明了组织参观和展览是适应目前大跃进形势的领导方法。
    为什么组织参观和展览能够产生这样巨大的力量？这是因为人的认识总是经常落在客观事物发展的后面，对于新鲜事物，总会有人不相信，有人不理解。怎么办？如果不叫他亲自看一看，亲自调查研究一番，即使你说了一百遍，他听了一百回，也未必能叫他相信，叫他理解。安徽治水规模这样大，几个月之间，一个八亿方、两个八亿方的治水任务都相继被突破了，现在又完成了第三个八亿方。报纸宣传了，上级也说了，有些人就是不相信，说那能有这样的“奇迹”？后来许多人自己去看了，调查了，也就疑团顿释了。真是“百闻不如一见”。“看得清，记得明，思想转变快、办法学得真”，这几句话，就是很多干部和群众对于参观和展览这两种方法的生动的评语。
    毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说：“认识的过程，第一步，是开始接触外界事情，属于感觉的阶段。第二步，是综合感觉的材料加以整理和改造，属于概念、判断和推理的阶段。只有感觉的材料十分丰富（不是零碎不全）和合于实际（不是错觉），才能根据这样的材料造出正确的概念和论理来。”这段话讲的是唯物主义的认识论问题，它对于指导我们如何改进领导方法和工作方法，有巨大的实际意义。人的头脑，只能做加工的工作，原料和半成品，则是来自客观实际，来自群众。脱离实际、脱离群众，脑子是决不能造出什么正确的思想来的。因此，我们在领导任何工作的时候，必须经常走出办公室，到下面实地参观，作调查研究，同工人农民接触，汲取营养，增加感性知识（有些事情还要自己直接实践——如种“试验田”），只有这样，才能获得十分丰富和合于实际的感觉材料，才能根据这些材料得出正确的结论，才能据以确定和实行切合实际的方针和政策。
    当领导者经过实地的调查或者试验而得出正确的结论之后，事情还只完成了一半。另一半的问题是如何使广大群众也有这种正确的认识，并且行动起来。
    党一直教导我们，做任何工作都要走群众路线，就是说，要从群众中集中起来，又到群众中坚持下去。在集中和坚持的过程中，又必须采取一般号召和个别指导相结合的方法。这个道理，已经反复地讲过多次，很多同志是知道的。但是，要贯彻党的群众路线，还需要适应当前的形势，找到一些具体的形式。参观和展览就是这样的两个方法。要组织参观和展览，就要求领导人必须善于深入实际，深入群众，发现先进典型，并认真地去总结先进经验，把群众的实践经验集中起来，经过研究，形成正确的领导意见，这就是从群众中来。组织参观和展览，就便于用先进经验去普遍地指导群众，使它为更多的群众所接受、所坚持，这就是到群众中去。参观和展览的方法，具体地体现了坚决依靠群众、用群众自己的经验来教育群众、用先进带动落后、用个别带动一般的群众路线的原则。运用这种方法，也可以有效地打掉官风，防止和克服领导机关官僚化的危险。
    目前我国的社会主义建设事业呈现着全民性的群众运动，各方面的工作都在十分广阔的规模上向前跃进。在过去八年特别是过去两年中，我们的社会主义建设事业已经获得了巨大的成就，已经出现了许多先进的典型，已经积累了许多宝贵的经验，而且在最近时期全国人民的社会主义建设高潮中，又出现了更多的先进范例。现在的问题是如何把这些先进的典型最广泛地加以推广，更大量地把中间和落后的状态提高到先进水平。在这个时候，普遍地推行参观和展览的方法就更加有必要了。
    在目前的形势下，讲究工作方法有特别重要的意义。是唯物主义、群众路线的工作方法，还是主观主义、官僚主义的工作方法，这是根本不同的两种工作方法。前一种是促进的方法，我们必须学会；后一种是促退的方法，必须坚决反对。参观和展览，就是一种唯物主义的、群众路线的工作方法，必须大力推广。我们还要在实践中努力总结经验教训，不断地创造出适应于新形势的其他一些工作方法。这是一个迫切的十分重要的任务。
