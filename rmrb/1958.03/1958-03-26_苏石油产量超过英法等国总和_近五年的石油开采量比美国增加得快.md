Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 24th. Karamkarov, a member of the Soviet State Planning Committee, published an article in "Pravda" today stating that the Soviet Union's oil production has exceeded the total of Britain, France, West Germany, and the Netherlands. In the last five years, the United States' oil extraction has only increased by 42.2 million tons, while the Soviet Union has increased by 51 million tons.

Karamkarov said that to increase this oil production, the United States drilled a total of 338 million meters of new oil wells, while the Soviet Union only drilled 27 million meters. This clearly illustrates the improvement in the technical level of the Soviet oil industry.

The author of the article pointed out that because the Soviet oil industry is equipped with first-class drilling equipment and uses advanced drilling methods, the oil production increase from each new Soviet oil well is now two and a half times more than in 1951 to 1955, and six times more than in 1936 to 1940. At the same time, between 1955 and 1957, the funds required for each ton of oil produced in the Soviet Union decreased by two-fifths compared to 1951 to 1953, and the cost of each ton of oil decreased by more than 40% between 1951 and 1957.

The author also said that the Soviet Union will increase its oil production to 350 million to 400 million tons in the next fifteen years, that is, increase the annual oil production by 17 million to 20 million tons. Last year, the Soviet Union's oil production increase already reached 14.44 million tons.

    苏石油产量超过英法等国总和
    近五年的石油开采量比美国增加得快
    新华社莫斯科24日电　苏联国家计划委员会委员卡拉姆卡洛夫今天在“真理报”上发表文章说，苏联的石油产量已经超过英国、法国、西德和荷兰的总和。在最近五年中，美国的石油开采量只增加了四千二百二十万吨，而苏联则增加了五千一百万吨。
    卡拉姆卡洛夫说，为增产这些石油，美国总共钻了三亿三千八百万公尺的新油井，而苏联只钻了两千七百万公尺。这清楚地说明了苏联石油工业技术水平的提高。
    文章的作者指出，由于苏联石油工业装备了头等的钻井设备，采用了先进的钻井方法，现在苏联每个新油井的石油增产量已经比1951年到1955年多二倍半，比1936年到1940年多六倍。同时，在1955年到1957年间，苏联增产的每吨石油所需要的资金比1951年到1953年减少了十二分之五，每吨石油的成本在1951—1957年间降低了40％以上。
    文章作者又说，苏联在最近十五年内将把石油的产量增加到三亿五千万吨到四亿吨，即把每年的石油增产量提高到一千七百万吨到两千万吨。而去年苏联的石油增产量就已经达到一千四百四十万吨。
