    Western Reactions to New Soviet Proposals Divided
    Britain and France More Flexible, U.S. Insists on Stubborn Rejection

    This newspaper's comprehensive report: The reactions of the United States, Britain, and France to the Soviet Union's new proposal regarding the convening of a summit meeting show some degree of divergence. Britain and France have taken a more flexible attitude, while the United States continues to insist on a stubborn rejection stance.

    A French government spokesman said at a press conference on the 4th that France welcomes the Soviet government's new proposal to hold a foreign ministers' meeting to prepare for a top-level meeting. This proposal is a "step forward" towards an East-West summit meeting.

    The spokesman went on to say that the French government believes that the proposed foreign ministers' meeting should put forward a draft agenda for the top-level meeting and draw up a list of countries to participate in the meeting, but France does not agree to set a date for the meeting in advance. He also said that the Soviet proposal to hold a foreign ministers' meeting in April is "too early" in any case.

    British Prime Minister Macmillan said on the evening of the 4th at a Conservative Party gathering that he hopes the summit meeting will be successful, and he believes that an East-West summit meeting may achieve some progress in "limited areas."

    Macmillan emphasized that one should not have "too high expectations" for this meeting. However, he believes that a summit meeting, "even if it succeeds only on the smallest scale, can lead to other meetings and discussions of other issues, so that the process of gradually easing tensions and eliminating pressures can begin."

    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on the 4th that the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union are "not acceptable to the United States" because the United States believes that under these conditions "there cannot be the kind of meeting that the United States wants."

    Dulles brought out another obstacle set up by the United States on the road to a summit meeting, emphasizing that the summit meeting must have a so-called "good prospect of reaching an agreement." He said that the United States believes that holding a summit meeting is "unlikely to be of any benefit" unless further discussions are held to clarify the attitudes of all parties on some issues. He said that he does not yet know whether the known attitudes of the parties at present indicate that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement on any important matter.

    Dulles emphasized that the United States refuses to accept the Soviet proposal to discuss the agenda and members of the summit meeting at the foreign ministers' meeting, and the United States advocates discussing substantive issues at the foreign ministers' meeting. He said that if substantive issues are not "fully explored," "the United States does not want to hold a summit meeting."

    Dulles also stated that the United States will adhere to its position of not helping to solve the German problem and will include this issue on the agenda of the summit meeting.

    Speaking of disarmament, Dulles emphasized that the United States currently has "no intention" of changing the proposal it made with other Western countries at the London disarmament talks last year.

    At the request of the United States, the Permanent Representatives Council of the North Atlantic Group met in Paris on the evening of the 4th to discuss the Soviet Union's recent proposal on holding a summit meeting and a foreign ministers' meeting. After the meeting, a spokesman said: "Unless some agreement is reached on substantive issues, including European security and German reunification, the Western countries cannot agree to hold a summit meeting."

### 西方对苏联新建议反应分歧  英法态度比较变通　美国坚持顽拒立场

    西方对苏联新建议反应分歧
    英法态度比较变通　美国坚持顽拒立场
    本报综合报道　苏联关于召开首脑会议的新建议，美英法三国的反应表现了某种程度的分歧。英法两国的态度比较变通，而美国则继续坚持顽固拒绝的立场。
    法国政府发言人4日在记者招待会上说，法国欢迎苏联政府关于举行外长会议来准备最高级会议的新建议。这项建议朝着东西方最高级会议“前进了一步”。
    这位发言人接着说，法国政府认为，拟议中的外长会议应当提出最高级会议的议程草案和拟定参加这个会议的国家名单，但是法国不同意先确定一个开会的日期。他还说，苏联建议在4月召开外长会议无论如何是“太早”了。
    英国首相麦克米伦4日晚间在一次保守党的集会上说，他希望最高级会议成功，他认为，东西方最高级会议有可能在“有限的方面”取得某些进展。
    麦克米伦强调，不应该对这次会议“期望过高”。但是，他认为，一次最高级会议“即使只在最小的规模上取得成功，也可以引导到召开其他会议和讨论其他问题，这样，逐步地缓和紧张局势和消除压力的过程就可以开始”。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯4日在记者招待会上说，苏联提出的条件“不是美国所能接受”的，因为美国认为在这些条件下“不可能有美国所希望的那种会议”。
    杜勒斯搬出了美国在朝向最高级会议的道路上布下的另一个障碍，强调最高级会议必须有所谓“达成协议的良好前景”。他说，美国认为，举行一次最高级会议是“不可能有什么益处的”，除非再进行一些讨论，弄清各方对一些问题的态度。他说，他现在还不知道目前各方的已知态度表明任何重要事情有达成协议的可能。
    杜勒斯强调，美国拒绝接受苏联关于在外长会议上讨论最高级会议的议程和成员的建议，美国主张在外长会议上讨论实质问题。他说，如果不对实质问题进行“充分的探讨”，“美国就不希望举行最高级会议”。
    杜勒斯还表示，美国将坚持它无助于解决德国问题的立场，并且要把这个问题列入最高级会议的议程。
    谈到裁军问题，杜勒斯强调，美国目前“无意”改变它同其他西方国家去年在伦敦裁军谈判中提出的建议。
    由于美国的请求，北大西洋集团常任代表理事会四日晚间在巴黎开会讨论了苏联最近提出的关于举行最高级会议和外长会议问题的建议。会后，一位发言人说：“除非就包括欧洲安全和德国重新统一问题在内的一些实质性问题达成某种协议，西方国家不能同意举行最高级会议。
