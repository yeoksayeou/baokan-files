    Fighting for a Yield of 2420 Jin Per Mu
    The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, known as a "bumper harvest stronghold," which set a national record for high-yield rice production over a large area, aims to achieve a yield of 2,420 jin per mu this year, based on an average yield of 1,406 jin per mu across more than 7,000 mu of rice last year. The cooperative members are currently preparing the paddy fields according to the standards of flatness, depth, thoroughness, and decomposition.
