Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 21st: The Chinese Communist Party Jiangsu Provincial Committee's symposium on people-run agricultural middle schools concluded on the 19th. The meeting exchanged experiences from various regions of the province regarding the development of agricultural middle schools. Based on the demands of the masses in various counties, the province will develop 4,298 agricultural middle schools, totaling 8,703 classes, this spring and autumn. These people-run agricultural middle schools are distributed in 2,055 townships. Together with the existing public and private middle schools, this year all 2,170 townships in the province can have at least one middle school.

Jiangsu Province is a province with relatively developed education. Since liberation, the number of junior middle schools has increased 3.8 times. However, it still cannot solve the problem of primary school graduates' access to further education. After the establishment of people-run agricultural middle schools, 460,000 students can be enrolled this year. Some areas, after establishing agricultural middle schools, can enable all graduating senior primary school students to continue their studies this year; some areas can also absorb previous graduates who have not been able to continue their studies. The establishment of this type of school has aroused a good response from the masses in Jiangsu. They warmly support this measure by the Party and the government, considering it "a good method unprecedented since ancient times" and "schools delivered to their doorsteps." Because teaching adopts a half-work, half-study approach, closely linked to reality, they are also called "schools that are both literate and martial" and "training classes for cadres and technicians of agricultural cooperatives" by the masses. Hearing that schools are being prepared for establishment, farmers automatically repair school buildings, gather desks and chairs, enthusiastically help with enrollment, and send their children to register for exams; some even bring back their children and siblings who are studying elsewhere to apply to the schools. The schools, adhering to the principle of diligence and thrift in running schools, without spending a penny of state money, have been established in a few days. Currently, in more than 70 counties and cities across the province, agricultural middle schools are being established every day, and several thousand classes can be established in late March and early April.

These schools are all run under the direct leadership of the local Party organizations. Party committees at all levels have regarded the preparation of people-run agricultural middle schools as one of the central tasks, with secretaries taking the lead in planning education and production together in a unified and comprehensive manner, so progress is rapid and smooth. School expenses, based on the principle of "whoever studies pays," are determined by the township Party committee together with the agricultural cooperatives, student parents, and others, to formulate student fee standards and payment methods. Teachers are mainly hired locally from high school graduates who have not continued their studies, cadres sent to lower levels, and agricultural technology extension station cadres, etc. The secretary of the township Party committee also serves as a teacher for political and other subjects. The province's agricultural middle schools need more than 9,000 teachers, which can be solved locally. In order to consider the long-term development and solve the problem of teachers needed for the future development of agricultural middle schools, four higher normal schools and two agricultural colleges in the province, through running correspondence universities, divide up the regions and take turns training agricultural middle school teachers, helping to cultivate and improve the teaching staff. Some normal colleges send students to agricultural middle schools for one-year educational internships. The four higher normal schools have revised their development plans, expanding enrollment from this year to accelerate the training of teachers.

In the new situation of the large-scale development of people-run agricultural middle schools, Jiangsu Province has revised its educational work plan. Now it is vigorously developing primary schools, and soon it will be possible to have a primary school in every agricultural cooperative in the province. People-run vocational high schools are being piloted in some counties. The establishment of people-run institutions of higher learning, based on special districts, is also actively being prepared. It is expected that within two years, Nantong, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Yancheng, and Huaiyin five special districts will each establish a normal junior college, and Suzhou special district will establish three junior colleges for sericulture, machine manufacturing, and textile industries. Nanjing City has decided to gradually establish an agricultural junior college based on high school graduates organized to go to the countryside for production, and in contact with relevant parties.

At the end of the meeting, Comrade Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Propaganda, attended the meeting and gave instructions.

    生产大跃进　教育要跟上
    江苏大力发展民办农业中学
    今年全省每个乡镇最少有一个中学
    新华社南京21日电　中共江苏省委召开的民办农业中学座谈会，已于19日结束。会议交流了全省各地区有关发展农业中学的经验。根据各县群众的要求，全省今年春季和秋季要发展农业中学四千二百九十八所，计八千七百零三个班。这些民办农业中学分布在二千零五十五个乡、镇。连同原有公立和民办的中学，今年全省二千一百七十个乡镇可以做到每一乡镇最少有一所中学。
    江苏省是一个教育比较发达的省份。解放以来，初级中学增加了三点八倍。但仍然不能解决小学毕业生的升学问题。民办农业中学建立后，今年就可以招生四十六万人。有些地区成立农业中学后，就可以使今年毕业的高小毕业生全部升学；有的地区还可以吸收以往历届未升学的高小毕业生升学学习。这种学校的成立，已引起江苏各地群众的良好反映。他们热烈拥护党和政府的这个措施，认为是“亘古以来未有的好办法”、“送上门的学校”。由于教学采取半耕半读、密切联系实际，又被群众称为“能文能武的学校”、“农业社的干部和技术人员训练班”。听到学校筹备成立，农民们自动修理校舍，凑课桌课椅，热情地帮助招生，送子女报名考试；有的把到外地补习的子女兄弟找回来送到学校报考。学校本着勤俭办学原则，不花国家一文钱，在几天之内就办了起来。目前全省七十多个县、市天天都有农业中学成立，在3月底4月初可以办起几千个班。
    这些学校都是在当地党组织直接领导下举办的，各级党委都把筹办民办农业中学作为中心工作之一，书记动手，把办学和生产等工作一起统一规划，全面安排，所以进展都迅速顺利。学校费用根据谁读书谁出钱的原则，由乡党委会同农业社、学生家长等一起研究制订学生交费标准和交费办法。教师主要是就地聘请未升学的高中毕业生、下放干部、农业技术推广站干部等担任，乡党委会书记也兼任政治等学科教师。全省农业中学共需教师九千多人，可以就地解决。为了从长远着眼，解决农业中学未来发展所需要的师资问题，全省四所高等师范学校和二所农学院，通过举办函授大学，分区包干轮训农业中学教师，帮助培养提高师资。有的师范学院派学生到农业中学作为期一年的教育实习。四所高等师范学校都修改发展计划，从今年起扩大招生，加速培养师资。
    在民办农业中学大量发展的新形势下，江苏省修订了教育工作的规划。现在正在大力发展小学，不久就可以做到全省每个农业社社社有小学。民办职业高中，有部分县正在试办。以专区为单位建立民办高等学校，也在积极筹备。预计二年内南通、徐州、镇江、盐城、淮阴五个专区各办起师范专科学校一所，另在苏州专区办蚕桑、机器制造、纺织等三所专科学校。南京市决定以组织下乡生产的高中毕业生为基础，和有关方面联系，逐步办成农业专科学校。
    会议结束时，中共中央政治局候补委员、宣传部长陆定一同志出席会议，并作了指示。
