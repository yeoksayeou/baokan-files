Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 18th (by our correspondent Yang Yi) -- Czechoslovak agricultural workers are striving to increase the total agricultural output by 11.9% this year and achieve a Great Leap Forward on the agricultural production front.

    In order to ensure the completion of agricultural production increases, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has instructed rural Party organizations to pay attention to this work, and has called on workers living in rural areas to actively participate in the work of agricultural Party organizations and to care for and help agricultural cooperatives. At a recent expanded meeting, the Presidium of the Central Committee of the National Front demanded that this year's agricultural production increase task be listed as a task for the whole people, and that the entire National Front strengthen its participation in the political and organizational work of developing agriculture.

    In the upsurge of striving for a Great Leap Forward in agriculture, more than two-thirds of the unified agricultural cooperatives across the country have made guarantees to complete the agricultural production increase targets set by the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) one year ahead of schedule.

    Completing this year's agricultural production plan is of decisive significance not only for realizing the Second Five-Year Plan's agricultural production targets but also for accelerating the construction of socialism.

    According to the government plan, the central link in agricultural development this year is to increase crop production by 17%, and the main task in animal husbandry is to increase the number of cattle.

    The situation here shows that the great development of agricultural cooperativization and a high degree of industrialization last year have provided a reliable foundation for the increase in agricultural production.

    According to the government plan, in order to achieve agricultural production tasks, the supply of fertilizer this year will increase by 14% compared to last year, investment in rural basic construction will increase by 25%, and the area of improved soil nationwide will increase by 300,000 mu. In addition, 10,000 tractors and a large number of corresponding agricultural machinery and equipment will be supplied to agriculture. (A noteworthy phenomenon in this regard is that a large amount of agricultural machinery will be directly supplied to agricultural cooperatives.) The movement to ensure the supply of agricultural machinery and building materials will be further launched in relevant industrial enterprises.

    Expanding and consolidating the socialist component in agriculture politically and economically is an important way to increase production this year. In the first two months of this year, 200 unified agricultural cooperatives have been newly established nationwide, increasing the number of members by 30,000 and cultivated land by 2.1 million mu.

    In order to solve the labor problem in rural areas, the Youth League, under the instructions of the Party Central Committee, is launching a movement to encourage more young people to engage in agricultural production and settle in rural areas. After the industrial reorganization, the devolution of power and cadres from central organs will create favorable conditions for strengthening the leadership of people's committees and cooperatives at all levels, as well as enriching the agricultural production force.

    In addition, this year the government also advocates that agricultural cooperatives build their own water conservancy projects, improve soil, and carry out basic construction. Strengthening agricultural management and improving the utilization rate of machinery have been raised to an important position.

    捷争取农业生产大跃进
    今年要把总产量提高11.9％
    据新华社布拉格18日电  本社记者杨翊报道：捷克斯洛伐克农业劳动者正在争取在今年把农业总产量提高11.9％，在农业生产战线上实现大跃进。
    为了保证农业增产的完成，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会已经指示农村党组织重视这一工作，并且号召住在农村的工人主动参加农业党组织工作，关怀和帮助农业合作社。民族阵线中央委员会主席团在最近的一次扩大会议上，要求把今年农业增产任务列为全民任务，并且加强整个民族阵线参与发展农业的政治和组织工作。
    在争取农业大跃进的热潮中，全国已经有三分之二以上的统一农业合作社提出保证，要提前一年完成第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）所规定的农业增产指标。
    完成今年农业生产计划，不仅对实现第二个五年计划关于农业生产的指标，而且对加速建成社会主义也具有决定性的意义。
    根据政府计划，今年农业发展的中心环节是提高农作物生产17％，畜牧业方面的主要任务是增加牛的头数。
    这里的情况表明，去年农业合作化的大发展和高度的工业化为农业生产的提高提供了可靠的基础。
    根据政府计划，为了实现农业生产任务，今年的肥料供应将比去年增加14％，农村的基本建设投资将增加25％，全国改良土壤的面积将增加三十万亩。另外还将供给农业一万台拖拉机和大批相应的农业机器设备。（在这方面，一个值得注意的现象是，大量的农业机器将直接供给农业合作社。）保证供应农业机器和建筑材料的运动将在有关的工业企业中进一步展开。
    从政治上和经济上扩大并且巩固农业中的社会主义成分是今年增产的重要办法。今年头两月全国已经新建了二百个统一农业合作社，合作社增加了三万个社员和二百一十万亩耕地。
    为了解决农村中的劳动力问题，青年联盟在党中央的指示下，正在展开争取更多的青年从事农业生产、在农村中安家落户的运动。在工业改组以后，中央机关的权力和干部下放将为增强各级人民委员会和合作社的领导，以及充实农业生产力量创造有利的条件。
    此外，今年政府还提倡农业合作社自己兴修水利，改良土壤和进行基本建设。加强农业经营管理工作、提高机器利用率已被提到重要的地位。
