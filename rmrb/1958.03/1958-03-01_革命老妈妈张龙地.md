Revolutionary Old Mother Zhang Longdi

    Zhang Longdi, the 77-year-old revolutionary old mother who is famous in western Fujian, is a glorious banner of Chinese working women. From her participation in the revolution in 1927 to the national liberation in 1949, she never left the revolutionary ranks for more than 20 years, and worked hard for the Party for 20 years despite the dangers.
    During the Hou Tian Uprising in Longyan County in 1928, she led revolutionary women to participate in the battle to attack Longyan City. During the Soviet period, she served as the chairman of the district Soviet, etc. During the guerrilla war, she worked in the guerrilla team's clothing factory, overcame many difficulties, and ensured the supply of clothing. Sometimes she went deep into the enemy's blockhouse to post slogans and announcements of the Red Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the persecution of the reactionaries, she and her comrades hid in the deep mountains, reclaimed wasteland for production, and ate wild bamboo shoots and grass roots to satisfy their hunger, living an extremely hard life. Later, she fell ill and was carried back home. She pretended to be a deceased old woman from a neighbor's house and continued to stay in the village to do underground work until liberation. Now she is a standing committee member of the Fujian Provincial Women's Federation, honorary chairman of the Longyan County Women's Federation, and a county people's representative. Although she is very old, she still perseveres in revolutionary work. She often goes deep into nearby villages to understand the production situation and also personally participates in agricultural labor.

    革命老妈妈张龙地
    闻名闽西的七十七岁的革命老妈妈张龙地，是中国劳动妇女的一面光荣旗帜。她从1927年参加革命到1949年全国解放，二十多年中没有一刻离开过革命队伍，二十年出生入死为党做了不少工作。
    1928年龙岩县后田暴动时，她领导革命妇女参加了攻打龙岩城的战斗。在苏维埃时期曾任区苏维埃主席等职。游击战争时期，她在游击队被服厂工作，克服了很多困难，保证了被服的供给。有时她深入到敌军碉堡周围张贴红军的标语布告。在抗日战争时期，由于反动派的迫害，她和同志们一起隐蔽在深山中，开荒生产，以野笋、草根充饥，过着极其艰苦的生活。后来病倒，被抬回家中，她就冒充邻居一个刚亡故的老婆婆，继续留在村里做地下工作，直到解放。现在她是福建省妇联常委、龙岩县妇联名誉主席和县人民代表。她年纪虽然很大了，但对革命工作仍坚持不懈。她经常深入到附近的村子里去了解生产情况，还亲自参加农业劳动。
