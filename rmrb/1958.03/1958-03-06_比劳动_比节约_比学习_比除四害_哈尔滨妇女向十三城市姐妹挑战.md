Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th: More than 1,200 diligent and thrifty activists from Harbin City, representing the women of the city, proposed to women in thirteen cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and Qiqihar and Jiamusi in the province, to launch a campaign of diligence and thrift in managing households. This challenge was put forward at the city-wide conference of activists in diligence and thrift in managing households, which closed on March 1st.

In their letter of challenge, the women of Harbin put forward competition conditions such as competing in labor, competing in thrift, competing in learning, competing in eliminating the four pests, competing in wiping out illiteracy, and competing to be advanced. They proposed that over 95% of the female labor force in the suburban rural areas should work between 120 and 250 days throughout the year, and this year they should raise 230,000 pigs and more than 1.16 million chickens.

They also proposed to universally develop the habit of careful calculation and planned, thrifty living. Each urban household should save two to four yuan per month, and each rural household should deposit one to two yuan per month. Take various measures to save an average of one jin of grain per household per month on the basis of rations; strive for each person to save one chi of cloth per year.

The women of Harbin also proposed to actively participate in the patriotic health campaign centered on "eliminating the four pests" and the literacy campaign, and work with the people of the city to achieve "eight-free city" (free of rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, and elimination of bedbugs, lice, fleas, cockroaches) and eliminate women's illiteracy within this year.

    比劳动　比节约　比学习　比除四害
    哈尔滨妇女向十三城市姐妹挑战
    据新华社哈尔滨5日电　哈尔滨市一千二百多名勤俭持家积极分子，代表全市妇女向北京、上海、武汉、沈阳、长春、吉林和本省齐齐哈尔、佳木斯等十三个城市的妇女倡议展开勤俭持家竞赛。这个挑战是在3月1日闭幕的全市妇女勤俭持家积极分子大会上提出的。
    哈尔滨市妇女在挑战书中提出了比劳动、比节约、比学习、比除四害、比扫文盲、比先进等竞赛条件。她们提出市郊农村95％以上的女劳动力全年要出勤一百二十到二百五十天，今年要养猪二十三万口、养鸡一百一十六万多只。
    她们还提出要普遍养成精打细算、有计划地俭朴地过日子的习惯。城市每户每月要储蓄两元到四元，农村每户每月存款一元到两元。采取各种办法在定量基础上，平均每户每月节约一斤粮食；争取每人一年节约一尺布。
    哈尔滨市妇女还提出要积极参加“除四害”为中心的爱国卫生运动和扫除文盲运动，和全市人民一道争取在今年内实现“八无城”（无鼠、无雀、无蝇、无蚊和消灭臭虫、虱子、跳蚤、蟑螂）和扫除妇女文盲。
