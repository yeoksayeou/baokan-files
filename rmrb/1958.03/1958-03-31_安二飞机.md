After this newspaper published the news of the birth of the An-2 aircraft and its mass production in our country, many readers expressed great interest in the An-2 aircraft. They wrote letters asking: What important role does the mass production of An-2 aircraft play in the development of our national economy? Now, we will answer these questions as follows:

The An-2 aircraft is a multi-purpose civilian aircraft. Since our country successfully imitated it in December last year, it is being mass-produced.

The An-2 aircraft is highly effective and cost-saving in agricultural production. In the past five years, 56 counties in 13 provinces and autonomous regions of our country have used imported An-2 aircraft to control locusts on a total of more than 11 million mu of farmland. Each An-2 aircraft can complete the task of spraying 30,000 to 40,000 mu of farmland per day, working six hours a day. The work efficiency is about 10,000 times that of manual labor, and the cost is about 20% to 80% lower than manual labor. The killing rate of pests is 98% to 100%, which is also higher than the efficiency of manual spraying. Farmers say good things about aircraft locust control: "Manual locust control kills the locusts, but also tramples the crops; aircraft locust control covers a large area and sprays evenly, saving time and medicine. It is truly an inescapable net, and the locusts have nowhere to hide." In recent years, the An-2 aircraft has been used domestically to control cotton bollworms, wheat thrips, rice stem borers, etc., and the effect is also very good. In addition, An-2 aircraft can also be used for fertilization, weeding, sowing, and preventing and controlling orchard pests.

Using An-2 aircraft for geological surveys can survey 90 to 110 square kilometers per hour, which is fast and accurate. Since 1953, our country has used imported An-2 aircraft for magnetic surveys, radioactive exploration, and gravity measurements, covering a total of 1.1 million square kilometers. It is estimated that an aircraft team of about 10 people can survey 40,000 to 50,000 square kilometers per year, while a manual survey team of about 50 people can only survey more than 2,000 square kilometers per year. It is especially suitable to use aircraft for surveying in sparsely populated and remote desert areas. The cost is also only one-quarter of that of manual surveying.

The An-2 aircraft is economical and convenient for transportation. It can carry 1,500 kilograms of cargo at a time, or carry 10 passengers, or be used for rescue. When fully loaded with gasoline, it can fly continuously for more than ten hours, with a range of more than 2,000 kilometers.

The An-2 aircraft can be used for forest protection, transport firefighters, and spray fire extinguishing liquid to quickly extinguish fires. As for water conservancy planning, aerial photography, and fish school detection, the An-2 aircraft can play an effective role. If a turbocharger is installed, it can also fly at an altitude of more than 7,000 meters to conduct atmospheric exploration or navigate the Tibetan Plateau. After installing pontoons or skis, it can also work on water or snow.

The An-2 aircraft can be widely used in various sectors of the national economy because it has many unique properties and structures. For example, it does not require a dedicated airport, as long as there is a field of 180 meters in length, it can take off and land quickly. It can also fly at an ultra-low altitude of 5 meters above the ground, making it especially suitable for agricultural use. Because it can climb and descend along the mountains at low altitudes with large slopes, it is both stable and reliable, and therefore it can help us quickly explore underground resources. It also has a spacious cockpit canopy, ensuring good visibility, which makes various professional flights very convenient. The aircraft is also equipped with a complete set of modern flight instruments and radio equipment, which can fly in complex weather conditions and at night.

The raw materials for manufacturing An-2 aircraft can all be supplied by our country. It also saves fuel, with fuel consumption per kilometer about twice that of the Liberation brand car. Although its load capacity is only one-third of that of a car, its maximum speed is four times that of a car. Its utilization rate is also high. An An-2 aircraft can undertake various different tasks as needed. During the busy agricultural season in the second and third quarters, it can be engaged in agricultural production; during the slack season, it can be used for transportation; in winter, it can be used in the north after being equipped with skis; and it can be used in the southeast coast after being replaced with pontoons. For a country with a vast area like ours, to complete various construction tasks, develop and utilize civil aviation, using this "omnipotent" An-2 aircraft is the best choice.

    安二飞机
    本报发表了安二飞机诞生以及我国成批生产的消息以后，许多读者对安二飞机感到极大的兴趣。他们纷纷来信询问：安二飞机成批生产对我国发展国民经济有什么重要作用？现在，我们就这些问题答复如下：
    安二飞机是一种可作多种用途的民用飞机。我国自去年12月仿制成功后，正在大批生产。
    安二飞机在农业生产上效用高、费用又省。五年中，我国有十三个省、自治区的五十六个县曾用过进口的安二飞机，灭蝗的农田总面积有一千一百多万亩。每架安二飞机每天工作六小时，可以完成三至四万亩农田的喷药任务，工作效率约为人工的一万倍，费用比人工大约低20％到80％，对害虫的杀伤率达98％到100％，也比人工喷药的效率要高。农民们对飞机灭蝗说得好：“人工灭蝗，蝗虫打光，庄稼也踩光；飞机灭蝗，面大粉匀，省时省药，真真是天罗地网，蝗虫无处躲藏。”近年来国内已用安二飞机来防治棉虫、小麦吸浆虫、稻螟虫等，效果也很好。此外，还可以用安二飞机施肥、除草、播种，防治果园虫害。
    用安二飞机来勘测地质，每小时可以探测九十至一百一十平方公里，又快又准确。1953年以来，我国用进口的安二飞机先后曾作过磁测、放射性探测以及重力测量，共探测了一百一十万平方公里。据估计，飞机一队约十人，每年可探测四至五万平方公里，而人工勘测队每队约五十人，每年才能勘测二千多平方公里，特别是在人烟稀少，偏僻沙漠地区，用飞机探测更合适。费用也只有人工探测的四分之一。
    安二飞机用于交通运输，既经济又方便，一次可以载货一千五百公斤，或载客十人，或用作救护。满装汽油时，它可以连续飞行十多个小时，航程在二千公里以上。
    安二飞机可以用来护林，可以运投灭火队，还可以用来喷射灭火液，迅速扑灭火灾。至于水利规划、空中摄影、鱼群探测，安二飞机都能发挥有效的作用。如果加装涡轮增压器，还可以在七千公尺以上的高空飞行，进行大气探测或在西藏高原航行。加装浮筒或雪橇后，还可以在水上或雪地工作。
    安二飞机所以能够在国民经济各部门广泛的使用，是因为它具备许多独特的性能和结构。比如：它不需专门的机场，只要有一块长一百八十公尺的田野就可以很快的起飞和着陆。它还可以作离地面五公尺高的超低空飞行，因而特别适合在农业上使用。由于它可以沿着山地在低空作大坡度的上升和下滑，既安稳又可靠，因而又可以帮助我们迅速探明地下资源。它还有宽敞的座舱罩，保证有良好的视界，使得各种专业飞行十分方便。机内还装有成套的现代化飞行仪表和无线电设备，可以在复杂的气象条件下和夜间飞行。
    制造安二飞机的原材料我国全部可以自给。它用油也省，每公里的耗油量约为解放牌汽车的二倍，虽然它的载重量只有汽车的三分之一，可是它的最大速度为汽车的四倍。它的利用率也高。一架安二飞机，可以根据需要承担各种不同的任务。二、三季度农忙，可以从事农业生产；农闲时可以运输；冬季装上雪橇可以在北方使用；换上浮筒就可以在东南沿海使用。对我们这样一个地区广阔的国家来说，要完成各种各样的建设任务，运用与发展民航事业，使用这种“万能的”安二飞机是最好不过的了。　　　　　　编　者
