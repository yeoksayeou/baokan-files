    The novel "Shanghai Morning" by Zhou Erfu, published in the second issue of "Harvest" in 1958, is based on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai. The images of several capitalists shaped by the writer in the work are of typical significance. Fang Qing's novella "Spring", through the form of a reporter writing a visiting diary, reflects the spiritual outlook of our new generation and writes about their great ambition to be the first generation of cultured farmers in New China. Xu Changlin's "Warm Spring on the Path" is a better script about the integration of scientists with workers and peasants.
    This issue of "Harvest" also published four short stories, three essays, and Yao Wenyuan's "The Free Kingdom of Miss Sophie—A Critique of Ding Ling's Early Works, and a Discussion of a Clue to the Development of Ding Ling's Creative Thought and Creative Tendency."
    Ba Jin's "Talking about 'Spring'" is another essay on creative writing by the author after "Talking about 'Home'".

    第二期的“收获”
    1958年第二期的“收获”上刊载的长篇小说周而复的“上海的早晨”，是以上海资本主义工商业的改造为题材的。作家在作品中塑造的几个资本家的形象是具有典型意义的。方青的中篇小说“泉”，通过一个记者写访问日记的形式，反映了我们新的一代的精神面貌，写出了他们要做新中国第一代有文化的农民的伟大气魄。徐昌霖的“陌上春暖”，是一个写科学家和工农结合的较好的剧本。
    这一期“收获”还登载了四篇短篇小说、三篇散文及姚文元的“莎菲女士们的自由王国——丁玲部分早期作品批判，并论丁玲创作思想和创作倾向发展的一个线索”。
    巴金的“谈‘春’”，是作者继“谈‘家’”后所写的又一篇创作谈。
