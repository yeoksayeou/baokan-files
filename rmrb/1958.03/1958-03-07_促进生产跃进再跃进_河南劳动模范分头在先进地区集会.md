    促进生产跃进再跃进
    河南劳动模范分头在先进地区集会
    新华社郑州6日电　河南省农业劳动模范代表大会5日分别在林县、济源、民权、信阳、南阳等十个地点同时开幕。这是河南省在农业战线上全面大跃进中，采取那里工作最先进就到那里开会的一种新的方法。
    会议开始由省委农村工作部副部长李玉亭、赵定远和省农业厅、林业厅、水利厅等有关部门的负责同志在各地简单报告了开会的意义后，接着就率领与会代表以七天的时间分别到先进地区参观学习治山、治水、造林和小麦、棉花、水稻、烟叶的大面积高额丰产等经验，并且进行座谈评比。因此，这次大会就是河南农业战线上一个比先进、学先进、赶先进的大会，也是促进1958年农业生产跃进再跃进的会议。
    据统计，参加这次大会的有一千一百多名劳模代表，列席会议的有一百零九名勤俭持家的农村妇女积极分子。他们中间有连年获得模范称号、全国闻名的老英雄苏殿选、赵怀义、石玉殿等，还有新涌现出来的大批新模范。
    河南省召开这次劳模大会，采取先参观后开会，看看讲讲，就地总结与交流经验，共同提高，开展劳动竞赛等办法，这对目前各地正在开展着的水利化运动、备耕工作和今年农业大跃进，将产生巨大的推动作用。
