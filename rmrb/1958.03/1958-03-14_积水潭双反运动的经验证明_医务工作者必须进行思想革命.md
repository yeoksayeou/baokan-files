The Experience of the Jishuitan Double-Anti Movement Proves That Medical Workers Must Undergo Ideological Revolution

    This newspaper reports that Beijing Jishuitan Hospital is vigorously launching an anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign. Through the movement, all medical staff in the hospital deeply feel that to make the hospital work leap forward, the hospital must thoroughly carry out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, and medical workers must undergo a profound ideological revolution.

    After the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on launching the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement on March 3, the hospital mobilized on the evening of the 4th. Within eight days, the number of big-character posters increased to more than 5,000, plus the big-character posters in the previous stage, a total of nearly 10,000. Everyone in the hospital posted big-character posters. Senior medical staff who were not accustomed to criticizing others or conducting self-criticism in public also posted big-character posters criticizing others and examining themselves this time. Many people expressed their willingness to hand over their hearts to the Party and to do everything for the patients.

    The big-character posters revealed many problems, including the hospital's rules and regulations, backlog and waste, charges, medical style, and so on. These facts show that the hospital's bureaucracy, inertia, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness are quite serious.

    Among the thousands of big-character posters, a group of them more concentratedly exposed and criticized the "five airs" of the obstetrics and gynecology department. The big-character posters pointed out that the director of the obstetrics and gynecology department, who had been in office for two years, rarely went to the outpatient department, and even less to the ward. The big-character posters revealed that the director had only been to the baby room twice and held two departmental meetings in the past two years. What was he doing? The big-character posters pointed out that he was engaged in his own "study" in the office every day. Some doctors in the department wanted to sleep, regardless of the parturient who was about to give birth, and the nurses had to invite them "three times." The director of the stomatology department, who had always thought that the technical level of his department was not lower than that of other hospitals, was also criticized by the doctors in the department in a joint big-character poster. They analyzed the problem of surgical suppuration rate and hoped that the director would break with conservative ideas as soon as possible.

    Many big-character posters show that the hospital is to serve the patients. Even if the hospital has formulated a leap forward plan and reformed some unreasonable systems, if the hospital staff does not eliminate the "five airs," break bourgeois ideology, and establish proletarian ideology, it is impossible to leap forward. He Peikun, an attending physician in internal medicine, was afraid of offending people in the past and dared not make suggestions. After receiving education in this movement, he put forward ten important suggestions for the work of internal medicine. He said, "Only this time did I feel the importance of ideological transformation." He expressed his willingness to be a promoter and a leftist.

    The double-anti movement in Jishuitan Hospital is developing in depth. In order to eradicate ideological diseases, all staff in the hospital have put forward many valuable suggestions.

### 积水潭双反运动的经验证明  医务工作者必须进行思想革命

    积水潭双反运动的经验证明
    医务工作者必须进行思想革命
    本报讯  北京市积水潭医院猛烈展开反浪费反保守运动。全院医务工作人员在运动中深深感到：要使医院工作大跃进，医院必须把反浪费反保守运动搞透，医务工作者必须进行深刻的思想革命。
    3月3日，中共中央发出了关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示以后，这个医院于4日晚就作了动员。八天之内，大字报就增加到五千多张，连同前一阶段的大字报，一共近万张。全院每一个人都贴了大字报。过去不习惯在大庭广众面前批评别人或进行自我批评的高级医务人员，这次每人都贴了大字报批评别人和检讨自己。许多人表示愿意把心交给党，愿意一切为了病人。
    大字报揭发出来的问题很多，包括医院的规章制度、积压浪费、收费、医疗作风等等。这些事实说明，医院的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气是相当严重的。
    在几千张大字报中，有一组比较集中地揭发和批评了妇产科的“五气”。大字报中提出：任职两年的妇产科主任，不但很少到门诊部去，就连病房也少去。大字报揭发说，科主任两年来只去过两次婴儿室，开过两次科务会。他在干什么呢？大字报指出，原来他每天在办公室里从事自己的“学习”。科内有的大夫图睡觉，不顾已临产的产妇，护士只得“三顾茅庐”相请。一直以为本科技术水平不低于其他医院的口腔科主任，这次也被科内大夫联名贴出大字报批评。他们分析了手术化脓率问题，希望科主任赶快打破保守思想。
    许多大字报说明：医院是为病人服务的，即使医院订出了跃进计划，改革了一些不合理的制度，如果医院工作人员不肃清“五气”，破资产阶级思想，立无产阶级思想，要跃进也是不可能的。内科主治大夫何培焜过去怕得罪人，不敢提意见；他接受了这次运动的教育，对内科工作即提出了十条重要意见。他说：“这次才感到思想改造的重要性。”他表示要做促进派，做左派。
    积水潭医院的双反运动正在深入开展中。全院工作人员为了根治思想病，已提出不少宝贵的建议。
