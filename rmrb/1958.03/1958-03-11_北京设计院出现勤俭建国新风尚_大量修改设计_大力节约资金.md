Xinhua News Agency Special Manuscript, Reporter Zhou Dingfang reports: The Beijing Design Institute has tightly grasped the guiding principle of the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, promoted a great leap forward in design work, and set off a high tide of ideological self-transformation among design personnel.

In more than a month of the anti-waste movement, this design institute focused on the key issue of opposing design waste and improving design quality. It mobilized all design personnel in the institute to adopt a three-pronged approach of exposing, inspecting, and correcting simultaneously to achieve the goals of improving work and saving wealth. This approach eliminated the ideological concerns of the design personnel. Within just four days, the walls upstairs and downstairs in the office building were covered with big-character posters of self-exposures and mutual exposures of design waste, as well as design modifications. It was truly a night of blooming flowers, with gold spread across the ground. With revolutionary spirit, all the design personnel proposed that "time should be subordinate to work," and began to modify the engineering designs with excessively high standards, excessively large areas, and blindly pursuing architectural forms, with the savings figures changing several times a day. Within four days, without affecting quality and applicability, they modified more than one hundred engineering designs that were under construction or had not yet started, saving the state 9.23 million yuan. While modifying the designs, everyone studied new advanced practices and new technical measures, attacking unreasonable habitual practices in design. In a very short period of time, the institute's technical committee reviewed and promoted ninety-two new technologies, greatly advancing production.

When checking for design waste and searching for the root causes, the debate of "designing for whom?" naturally emerged. The spearhead of the debate first pointed to the fact that engineer Song Xiutang, under the control of bourgeois individualistic design thought, caused a large amount of investment waste in order to establish a personal monument. The democratic atmosphere within the institute was unprecedentedly active, and a lively situation of self-criticism and mutual criticism emerged. The eight chief engineers of the institute also conducted self-examinations and criticisms. Chief Engineer Zhao Dongri stated in a big-character poster: "In my designs, I also had the idea of erecting personal monuments. Therefore, I tried to design the buildings as grand and beautiful as possible, and did not pay attention to projects that were not monumental enough." Chief Engineer Zhang Bo said: "In the past designs, I had serious problems of formalism and subjectivism, with more skills and less thinking; more eagerness to succeed and show myself, and less investigation and research starting from the people's interests; more guidance to owners to be extravagant and wasteful, and less consideration from the perspective of national savings." Mutual criticism and self-criticism have profoundly changed the relationship between people. Everywhere presents an atmosphere of mutual heart-to-heart talks, mutual inspiration, unity and friendship. Through the debate on design ideas, many design personnel realized that "only 'expertise' without politics will only bring harm to the people and no benefit, and is not worthy of the title of people's architect." Therefore, the design personnel launched a competition to do better in ideological examination and to dig up the roots more thoroughly, taking a big step forward in ideology.

After the double leap forward in ideology and production, amazing miracles appeared, and advanced speeds and advanced indicators that were previously unimaginable were achieved or exceeded. The design institute originally felt very strained when arranging the design task of 500,000 square meters for the first quarter of the year. In addition, the anti-waste movement required the re-modification and drawing of 550 drawings, requiring more than 13,000 man-hours, making the task even heavier. At this time, the construction unit entrusted them with the design task of fourteen factories with more than 100,000 square meters. The leaders of the institute were worried about not being able to complete the task and dared not accept it. However, as soon as it was taken to the design offices for discussion, the design task was snatched up by the design offices in half an hour, and it was guaranteed to be released before the end of March. This phenomenon was unprecedented. Design personnel everywhere posted good news about finding tricks, improving technology, and improving work efficiency. The cost of housing is also constantly decreasing. In 1956, it cost 211,000 yuan to design an eighteen-class middle school, but now it only costs 100,000 yuan. Now, the money used to build three residential buildings in the past can build five and a half buildings. Under the slogan of "Leap forward again and again, advance again and again," all the design personnel in the institute have launched a socialist competition of "comparing economy, comparing quality, comparing technology, comparing plans, comparing ideology, and comparing hygiene."

Many design personnel deeply felt during the movement that they must step up their self-transformation. On the evening of March 5, all technicians, engineers, and chief engineers thought and discussed their personal leap forward plans overnight. Zhu Zhaoxue, the chief engineer and director of the famous structural expert, planned to make a complete set of design methods in masonry structure within five years with the support of various design offices, reduce the cost by 20%, and exceed the current international level. Chief Engineer Zhang Bo proposed to make a ten-story building design with a cost of 65 yuan per square meter in the near future. The president and vice president of the design institute, and the political directors of each design office have all made personal plans. They plan to attend night university within five years, take engineers as teachers, and systematically study a design business. Each person also determined his own "experimental work number" as a way to get close to the masses and improve business.

### 北京设计院出现勤俭建国新风尚  大量修改设计　大力节约资金

    北京设计院出现勤俭建国新风尚
    大量修改设计　大力节约资金
    本报特约新华社专稿　记者周定舫报道：北京市设计院紧紧抓住反浪费反保守运动这条纲，推动了设计工作大跃进，掀起了设计人员自我思想改造的高潮。
    这个设计院在一个多月的反浪费运动中，抓住了反对设计浪费、提高设计质量这个关键问题，动员全院设计人员采取边揭发、边检查、边改正三管齐下的方法，来达到改进工作，节约财富的目的。这种做法，消除了设计人员的思想顾虑，在短短的四天内，办公楼楼上楼下的墙壁上，贴满了自我揭发、互相揭发设计浪费以及修改设计的大字报。真是一夜花开，黄金铺地。全院的设计人员用革命精神，提出“时间应服从工作”，连夜开始修改标准过高、面积过大、盲目追求建筑形式的工程设计，节约数字，一日数变；四天内，在不影响质量和适用的条件下，就修改了一百多项正在施工和尚未动工的工程设计，为国家节约了九百二十三万元。在修改设计的同时，大家钻研新的先进做法和新的技术措施，向设计中不合理的习惯做法冲击。在很短时间内，经院内的技术委员会审核并推行了九十二项新技术，生产上大大地跃进了一步。
    检查设计浪费，寻找产生根源时，自然而然地引出了“为谁设计”的辩论。辩论的矛头首先指向工程师宋秀棠在资产阶级个人主义设计思想支配下，为了树立个人纪念碑，造成大量浪费投资的事实。院内的民主空气空前活跃，出现了自我批评和相互批评的生动局面。院内的八个总工程师也都进行了自我检查和批判。赵冬日总工程师在大字报中检查说：“我在设计中，也有为个人树立纪念碑的思想。因而尽可能把建筑物设计得伟大、漂亮，对一些不够纪念碑的工程便不注意。”张鎛总工程师说：“在过去的设计中，我严重地存在着形式主义、主观主义的毛病，技巧多、思考少；急于求成表现自己多，调查研究从人民利益出发少；诱导业主铺张浪费做得多，从国家节约方面考虑得少。”相互批评和自我批评，使人与人之间的关系发生深刻变化。到处都呈现着互相谈心、互相启发、团结友爱的气氛。通过设计思想的辩论，许多设计人员都认识到“只有技术没有政治的‘专’，给人民带来的只有坏处没有好处，根本够不上人民建筑师的称号。”因此，设计人员又展开了比思想检查得好，比挖根挖得彻底的竞赛，思想上跃进了一大步。
    思想、生产双跃进以后，惊人的奇迹出现了，原先不能设想的先进速度和先进指标，纷纷达到或超过了。这个设计院原先在年初安排第一季度五十万平方公尺设计任务时，已经感到很吃紧，再加上在反浪费运动中需要重新修改和绘制的图纸五百五十张，需一万三千多个工时，任务是重上加重。这时，建设单位又来委托他们设计十四个工厂十万多平方公尺的设计任务，院的领导担心完不成任务不敢接受。但是，一拿到各设计室中去讨论，半个小时，设计任务就被各设计室抢光了，而且保证在3月底以前出图。这种现象是以往所没有的。设计人员们到处张贴着找窍门、改进技术、提高工作效率的捷报。房屋的造价也在不断降低，1956年设计一个十八班的中学，需要二十一万一千元，现在只要十万元就够了。现在用过去兴建三幢住宅的钱能盖五幢半。全院设计人员在“跃进再跃进，先进再先进”的口号下，又掀起了一个“比经济、比质量、比技术、比计划、比思想、比卫生”的社会主义大竞赛。
    许多设计人员在运动中深刻感到必须加紧自我改造。在3月5日晚上，全体技术员、工程师、总工程师都连夜思考，讨论了个人的跃进计划。著名的结构专家朱兆雪主任总工程师计划在各设计室的支援下，五年内在砖石结构方面要作出整套的设计方法，降低造价20％，并超过目前的国际水平。总工程师张鎛提出要在最近做出每平方公尺六十五元造价的十层高的建筑设计。这个设计院的院长、副院长、各设计室政治主任都制订了个人规划，他们计划要在五年内上夜大学，拜工程师为师，系统地学习一门设计业务。每人还确定自己的“试验工号”，作为自己接近群众和提高业务的方法。
