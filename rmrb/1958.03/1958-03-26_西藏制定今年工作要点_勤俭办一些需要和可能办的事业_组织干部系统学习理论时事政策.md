Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 25th. The Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held its 24th meeting today. It summarized its work in 1957, submitted a report to the State Council, and approved the key tasks for 1958. The meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the Committee, the Dalai Lama.

The summary pointed out that in 1957, based on the specific circumstances of Tibet, the central government determined that democratic reforms would not be implemented in the Tibet region during the Second Five-Year Plan, and that appropriate contraction would occur. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region vigorously carried out the work of reorganizing institutions, consolidating the original fourteen directly subordinate institutions into six. The surplus Tibetan and Han personnel were all properly handled.

The exemption of "corvée tax" from people of all ethnic groups in Tibet who participate in the work of state organs (including service personnel) and students (including university, middle, and primary school students) was a major event in Tibet's work in 1957. The summary said that it eliminated obstacles to the work of cultivating Tibetan cadres. The 23rd Standing Committee made a clear resolution on this matter, strictly stipulating that anyone who violates the provisions of this resolution in the future will be severely punished.

The key tasks for 1958 propose that the Tibet region will, in accordance with the principles of building the country through thrift, running enterprises through thrift, and managing all undertakings through thrift, and in conjunction with the specific conditions of Tibet, undertake some necessary, feasible, and beneficial undertakings for the vast majority of people in Tibet.

Organizing on-the-job cadres to systematically study political theory and current events and policies is an important task for 1958. At present, in conjunction with the national rectification campaign, a profound patriotic and socialist education should be carried out to improve the political and ideological level of cadres. At the same time, vigilance should be maintained at all times to oppose the subversive activities of imperialist elements and separatist elements aimed at undermining national unity, and to further strengthen and consolidate the unity and unification of the motherland.

    组织干部系统学习理论时事政策
    新华社拉萨25日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会常务委员会今天举行了第二十四次会议，总结1957年工作，向国务院提出报告，并通过了1958年工作要点。这次会议是由主任委员达赖喇嘛主持的。
    总结指出，1957年，根据西藏具体情况，中央确定了西藏地区在第二个五年计划期间不实行民主改革和适当收缩的方针，西藏自治区筹备委员会大力进行了整编机构的工作，将原有的十四个直属机构整编为六个。编余的藏、汉族工作人员，都作了妥善的处理。
    免去西藏各族人民参加国家机关工作的人员（包括勤杂人员）、学员（包括大、中、小学学生）的“人役税”，是1957年西藏工作中的一件大事情。总结说，它消除了培养藏族干部工作的障碍。第二十三次常务委员会为此曾作了明确的决议，严格规定：如今后再有违犯本决议规定者，将予严惩不贷。
    1958年的工作要点提出：西藏地区将本着勤俭建国、勤俭办企业和勤俭办一切事业的原则，结合西藏的具体情况，举办一些需要办、可能办、而且办了对西藏广大人民有好处的事业。
    组织在职干部系统地进行政治理论和政策时事学习，是1958年的一项重要工作。目前，应结合全国整风运动，进行一次深刻的爱国主义和社会主义教育，提高干部的政治思想水平。同时，应随时提高警惕，反对帝国主义分子和分离主义分子破坏民族团结的阴谋活动，进一步加强和巩固祖国的团结和统一。
