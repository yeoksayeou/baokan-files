Relying on Local Self-Construction: Investment Halved
The Experience of Ming Mountain Reservoir in Hubei Provides Food for Thought

    (Our report) The construction of the Ming Mountain Reservoir in Hubei Province has saved half of the entire project investment due to relying on local resources, relying on the masses, and managing water conservancy diligently and thriftily. The Macheng Ming Mountain Reservoir is a large water conservancy project in Hubei Province, with a national approved investment of 18.16 million yuan. Construction began on October 1, 1957, and is expected to be completed in April 1959. Last winter, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, based on the principle of diligent and thrifty water management and relying on the masses to manage water conservancy, re-examined the design budget of the Ming Mountain Reservoir, reducing it to 11.36 million yuan, which could save 6.8 million yuan. According to the current construction situation, another 2 million yuan can be saved. When the Ministry of Water Conservancy approved this project last year, it was feared that the investment of 18.16 million yuan would not be enough, but now only half of the national investment – more than 9.3 million yuan – is needed.
    The scale of the Ming Mountain Reservoir project is slightly smaller than that of the Guanting Reservoir, but it only cost one-fifth of the investment in the Guanting Reservoir. Last year's investment in one Ming Mountain Reservoir can now build two Ming Mountain Reservoirs. What is their experience?
    First, rely on the local Party committee, rely on the masses, and local responsibility. The Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, considering the enthusiasm of the people for building water conservancy projects, changed the earth and stone work of the irrigation canals to be handled by the masses themselves, and also reduced the unit price per work day for other earthwork projects from 1.12 yuan to 1.15 yuan to 0.8 yuan to 1 yuan. In fact, the local laborers only received 0.15 to 0.3 yuan, and the rest was extracted by the county or special commissioner's office to build other water conservancy projects, and the peasants were also very satisfied. However, in construction projects led by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, because the sources of ordinary workers are different, wages cannot be reduced. The reservoir resettled a total of 4,000 people, which was contracted by Macheng County. They relied on the masses to mobilize the beneficiary areas to move and build houses for the relocated households, drumming and gongs, helping to settle down, and only spent 384,000 yuan, equivalent to 96 yuan per person. This is not comparable to the hydropower stations and water conservancy projects currently under construction or about to be constructed. For example, the Tuoxi Hydropower Station requires 206 to 330 yuan per person for relocation, and 530 yuan for relocation outside the area. The Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station averages 478 yuan per person. The Xianghongdian and Mozitan Reservoirs cost 440 and 470 yuan, respectively. The 42 kilometers of external roads for the Ming Mountain Reservoir cost only 80,000 yuan based on relying on the masses, and the road quality and standards are very high. This is also difficult to achieve in hydropower construction. Currently, the cost of building roads per kilometer is between 30,000 and 60,000 yuan. The 109 kilometers of external roads for the Tuoxi Hydropower Station already have simple road surfaces, but still require an investment of 3.46 million yuan, with a cost of 32,000 yuan per kilometer, a difference in unit price of 16 to 17 times.
    Second, manage water conservancy diligently and thriftily, and vigorously reduce non-productive construction and indirect costs. The Ming Mountain Reservoir Project Headquarters is composed of leading comrades from the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, the Special Commissioner's Office, and Macheng and Xishui Counties, with 360 cadres and about 13,500 workers on the construction site. The workers did not bring their families, and neither did the leading comrades of the headquarters. Except for the 78 people supported by the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau who are responsible for pipe construction, there are no permanent workers, all of whom are local laborers and stonemasons from Henan. Technical workers are also selected from these people. The outside workers elect their own team leaders, deputy team leaders, and accountants; the local laborers are led by the township and commune. Workers take care of their own cooking utensils. Therefore, management cadres and indirect costs are greatly reduced. Indirect costs, including temporary housing construction, account for only 18.9% of the total investment. The ratio of cadres to workers is one to 37.5.
    In terms of construction management, they also adopted many innovative methods. For example, the tools for excavating earth and stone are depreciated according to the quota, and the production teams purchase gunpowder from the headquarters, changing the past practice of supplying as much as needed. The original plan for the channel sheds was to build 20,000 square meters, with an investment of 120,000 yuan. They decided to change to living in the houses of the residents, giving the farmers a subsidy of one yuan per room per year. The dam construction area has nearly 8,000 people, most of whom live in residential houses, and only 600 square meters were built for warehouses, sheds, canteens, laboratories, and guest houses, with a cost of only 3.8 to 4.27 yuan per square meter. The headquarters office is located in an old temple, and the guest house also has mud walls, no sofas or radios, and everything is simple. The construction site also canceled the cadre's daily construction subsidy of 0.2 yuan. When it rains and construction is not possible, ordinary workers only receive a subsidy of 0.3 yuan per person.
    At present, in general hydropower construction, indirect costs (excluding temporary construction costs) are 19.8%, the ratio of management cadres to workers is one to four to six, and temporary housing construction is mostly tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of square meters, with a unit price of 9 to 20 yuan. Some also build worker villages and hydropower towns. For example, the Shangyoujiang Hydropower Station, which has been built, had a maximum of more than 8,000 employees, and more than 80,000 square meters of temporary housing were built. 60% to 70% of the workers brought their families, and the engineering bureau spent 160,000 yuan to build two small buildings as dormitories. Ordinary workers at various construction sites also receive subsidies of 0.6 to 0.7 yuan on rainy days. Compared with the Ming Mountain Reservoir, the difference is very large.
    Third, conduct in-depth work, strengthen preparations before construction, and continuously improve design, planning, and construction. After the Ming Mountain Reservoir was designed, due to the leadership and technical cadres' in-depth on-site investigation and research, re-measurement was carried out before construction, and verification was carried out during construction, which greatly reduced the original planned amount of earth and stone work. For example, the main canal was originally listed as 2 million cubic meters, but after re-measurement and route change, it was reduced by 530,000 cubic meters. The original plan was for 800,000 cubic meters of stone, but there were only 170,000 cubic meters. These two items alone saved 1.03 million yuan. In addition, such as changing the dam soil to use part of river sand, and revising the design budget quota of the former State Construction Commission and the Ministry of Water Conservancy, all reduced a lot of investment.

    依靠地方自建　投资节省一半
    湖北明山水库提供的经验引人深思
    本报讯　湖北明山水库的建设，由于依靠地方，依靠群众，勤俭治水，使整个工程投资节省了一半。麻城明山水库是湖北省一个较大的水利工程，国家批准投资一千八百一十六万元。1957年10月1日开工，预计1959年4月完成。去年冬天，湖北省水利厅根据勤俭治水、依靠群众办水利的方针，重新审核了明山水库的设计预算，减为一千一百三十六万元，可以节省六百八十万元。根据目前施工情况看，还可节约二百万元。去年水利部批准这项工程的时候，投资一千八百一十六万元还怕下不来，现在只要国家投资一半——九百三十多万元就够了。
    明山水库工程的规模较官厅水库稍小一些，但只花了官厅水库投资的五分之一。去年一个明山水库的投资，今年能办两个明山水库。他们的经验在那里呢？
    第一、依靠地方党委，依靠群众，地方包干。湖北省水利厅考虑到民工修水利的积极性，将灌溉支渠土石方改由群众自办，其他土方工程每工单价也由一元一角二分至一元一角五分降低到八角至一元。实际上当地民工只领得一角五至三角，其余由县或专署抽出后，兴修其他水利工程，农民也很满意。而在水利电力部主持的建设工程中，由于普通工的来源不同，工资就不能减少一个。这个水库共移民四千人，由麻城县包干后，他们依靠群众，发动受益区为迁移户搬家盖房，敲锣打鼓，帮助安家落户，只花了三十八万四千元，每人合九十六元。这和目前正在施工或即将施工的水电站和水利工程也不能相比。如拓溪水电站，向后靠每人要二百零六至三百三十元，外迁五百三十元。新安江水电站平均每人四百七十八元。响洪甸、磨子潭水库各为四百四十及四百七十元。明山水库对外公路四十二公里，在依靠群众的基础上，只用了八万元，公路质量和标准都很高。这在水电建设中也很难办到。目前公路每公里造价在三至六万元之间。拓溪水电站对外公路一百零九公里，已有简便路面，但还要投资三百四十六万元，每公里造价三万二千元，单价相差十六、七倍。
    第二、勤俭治水，大力压缩非生产性建筑及间接费用。明山水库工程指挥部由省水利厅、专署和麻城、浠水两县领导同志组成，工地有干部三百六十人，工人约一万三千五百人。工人没有带家属，指挥部几个领导同志也是一样。除长江大桥工程局支援的负责管柱施工的七十八人外，没有固定工人，全部是当地民工和河南来的石工。技术工人也是从这些人里物色出来的。外来工人自选队长、分队长、会计；当地民工由乡、社负责带领。工人炊事用具一概自理。因此，管理干部和间接费用大大降低。间接费用，包括临时房屋建筑在内，只占整个投资的18.9％。干部和工人的比例为一比三十七点五。
    在施工管理上，他们也采取了不少的革新办法。如开挖土石方的工具，按定额折旧，火药由生产队向指挥部购买，改变了过去要多少花多少的供给制做法。渠道工棚原计划修两万平方公尺，投资十二万元。他们决定全改住民房，每间每年给农民补贴一元钱。大坝工区将近八千人，大部分人住民房，只修了六百平方公尺作仓库、工棚、食堂、试验室和招待所，每平方公尺造价只有三元八角至四元二角七分钱。指挥部办公室设在旧庙宇里，招待所也是土坯墙，没有沙发、收音机，一切都因陋就简。工地还取消了干部每天两角钱的施工补助费。天雨不施工时，普通工每人只补贴三角钱。
    目前在一般的水电建设中，间接费用（不包括临时性建筑费用）是19.8％，管理干部与工人的比例为一比四至六，临时房屋建筑多是几万至十几万平方公尺，单价也在九至二十元之间，有的还要建工人村、水电城。如已建成的上犹江水电站，职工人数最多时有八千多，临时房屋也盖了八万多平方公尺，有60％—70％的工人带家属，工程局花了十六万元修两栋小楼房作宿舍。各工地普通工雨天也补助六角至七角。同明山水库相比，距离很远。
    第三、工作深入，加强施工前的准备，不断改进设计、计划和施工。明山水库设计完成后，由于领导及技术干部深入现场调查研究，施工前进行复测，施工中进行校对，使原计划土石方工程量大大减少。如干渠原列二百万立方公尺，复测改线后减少了五十三万立方公尺。原计划石方八十万立方公尺，只有十七万立方公尺。仅这两项就节约了一百零三万元。此外，如大坝土料改用部分河沙，修改了前国家建设委员会和水利部的设计预算定额，都少用了不少投资。
