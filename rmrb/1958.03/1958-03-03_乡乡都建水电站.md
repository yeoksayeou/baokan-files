　　Building Hydroelectric Power Stations in Every Township
　　
    The mountainous areas of northern Fujian Province plan to establish hydroelectric power stations in every township by 1962. More than 500,000 peasant households in the mountainous areas will use cheap electric lights, and more than 4,000 agricultural and forestry production cooperatives will use electricity instead of manpower for irrigation, and implement electric processing for timber, grain, oil extraction, papermaking, tea making, and baking dried bamboo shoots. This is one of the plans recently set by the Nanping Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to realize a comprehensive leap forward in mountainous production. At present, the first batch of more than 20 hydroelectric power stations has started construction one after another, and most of them can generate electricity and supply processing production in the first half of this year.

    乡乡都建水电站
    福建省闽北山区计划到1962年乡乡都要建立水力发电站。山区的五十多万户农民将用上廉价的电灯，四千多个农、林业生产合作社将利用电力代替人力抽水灌溉，对木材、粮食、榨油、造纸、制茶、烤制笋干等实行电力加工。这是中共南平地委最近订出的实现山区生产全面大跃进的规划之一。现在，第一批二十多座水电站已陆续开工，今年上半年大部分就可以发电供应加工生产。　（据新华社讯）
