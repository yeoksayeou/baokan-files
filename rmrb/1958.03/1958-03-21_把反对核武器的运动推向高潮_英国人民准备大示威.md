Xinhua News Agency, London, March 19th: The British people from all walks of life are actively preparing to participate in the Easter peace demonstration (early April), opposing the use of nuclear weapons and demanding an early East-West summit conference.

Demonstrators will depart from Trafalgar Square in London on "Good Friday" (April 4th) and are scheduled to arrive at Aldermaston in Berkshire—Britain's nuclear weapons research center—on April 8th. There, they will hold an open-air rally and a week-long "vigil" at the entrance of the nuclear weapons research center. Labour MP Frank Allaun believes that this Easter march is the most important event he has experienced in his life.

The Easter March Committee has received letters from people of all classes in Britain, including Communists, Labour Party members, trade union members, and members of Parliament, as well as writers, artists, professors, students, and church people, all requesting to participate in the march. Many people have also expressed their willingness to prepare food and provide various services for the marchers along the fifty-mile route. Many places have organized "reception committees" to receive and assist the marchers.

In addition to the main march contingent departing from London, the masses along the route will join the main contingent. At the same time, various gatherings are currently being held in many large and small towns and universities in Britain to discuss the issue of nuclear disarmament.

    把反对核武器的运动推向高潮
    英国人民准备大示威
    据新华社伦敦19日电　各行各业的英国人民正在积极地准备参加定在复活节（4月初）举行的和平大示威，反对使用核武器和要求尽早举行东西方最高级会议。
    示威者将在“耶稣受难日”（4月4日）从伦敦的特拉法加广场步行出发，预定在4月8日到达培克郡的阿尔德马斯顿——英国的核武器研究中心。在那里，他们将举行露天集会，并且在核武器研究中心的门口举行一个星期的“守夜”节。工党议员弗兰克·阿隆认为，这次复活节游行是他一生所经历过的最重大的事件。
    复活节游行委员会收到了英国各阶层人民的来信，写信的有共产党员、工党党员、工会会员和议员，也有作家、艺术家、教授、学生和教会人士，他们都要求参加这次游行。许多人还表示愿意在游行队伍所经过的五十英里长的路上为游行者准备食物和提供各种服务。许多地方已经组织了“招待委员会”，准备招待和帮助游行者。
    除了从伦敦出发的游行大队以外，沿途各地群众将同大队汇合。同时，在英国许多大小城镇和高等学校中，目前正在举行各种各样的集会来讨论裁减核军备的问题。
