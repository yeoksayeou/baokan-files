    One Yam Weighing 125 Jin
    Zhuang Changzhi, a member of the Lishan Agricultural Cooperative in Huangren Township, Fuding County, Fujian Province, planted five yams last year and harvested a total of 326 jin, averaging 65 jin per yam. The largest one weighed 125 jin.
    Yams contain a lot of starch; every 100 jin of yams can be washed to produce 45 jin of starch. The starch can be used as food, and the pulp mixed with rice can be made into kueh (a type of cake). It can also be used as feed, and the fiber can be used to weave cloth.
    This crop does not take up much land and can be planted in the space in front of and behind houses. The planting method is very simple. Around the "Winter Solstice," simply press the yam vine head into the soil to prevent frost from killing it, and it will naturally take root and sprout in the spring. (Jiang Hen)

    一株葛薯125斤
    福建福鼎县黄仁乡梨山农业社社员庄昌枝，去年种了五株葛薯，共收三百二十六斤，平均每株六十五斤，最大的一株达一百二十五斤。
    葛薯含淀粉很多，每百斤葛薯能洗淀粉四十五斤。淀粉可以当口粮，粉渣掺些米还可以做粿吃，也能当饲料，纤维可织布。
    这种作物不占地，可以利用房前屋后的空间地来种。种的方法很简便，“冬至”前后，只要把葛薯藤头压入土中预防霜雪冻死，到春天自然能生根发芽。（江痕）
