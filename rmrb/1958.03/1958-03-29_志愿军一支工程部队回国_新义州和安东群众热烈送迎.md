Xinhua News Agency, XinYizhou, 28th: Over 5,000 citizens of XinYizhou braved the snow today to bid farewell to an engineering unit of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home, as it passed through the city. When the train carrying the Volunteer Army engineers and various construction machines arrived, it was warmly welcomed by the Korean people waiting at the station. At the farewell meeting, the citizens of XinYizhou presented gifts and letters of gratitude to the Volunteer Army engineering unit.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 28th: People from all walks of life in Andong braved the unusually cold weather of minus nine degrees Celsius for this time of spring, to warmly welcome an engineering unit of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteers returning home today.

The women of Guangji Street, who had suffered from American air raids, led their six- or seven-year-old children to the station to welcome them. When these children were born, their mothers often held them to hide from American air raids. Today, these children jumped happily into the arms of the Volunteer Army uncles.

On the platform, the welcoming people told the returning heroes about the leap-forward development of the motherland's construction, and the returning Volunteer Army engineers reported to their relatives in the motherland about their deeds in actively helping the Korean people restore construction after the Korean Armistice. Before the train departed, people on and off the train repeatedly encouraged each other and expressed their determination to build the motherland.

    新义州和安东群众热烈送迎
    据新华社新义州28日电　新义州五千多市民，今天冒雪送别过境的中国人民志愿军首批归国部队的一支工程兵部队。当载着志愿军工程兵和各种施工机械的列车到达的时候，受到等候在车站上的朝鲜人民热烈欢送。在欢送大会上，新义州市民向志愿军工程兵部队赠送了礼品和感谢信。
    新华社安东28日电　安东各界人民今天冒着入春以来少有的零下九度的严寒，热烈欢迎中国人民志愿军首批归国部队的一支工程兵部队。
    曾受过美机轰炸的广济街的妇女们，领着她们的六、七岁的孩子赶到车站欢迎。这些孩子出生的时候，母亲们曾经常怀抱着他们躲避美机轰炸。这些孩子今天欢跳着投到志愿军叔叔的怀里。
    站台上，欢迎的人们向归国英雄讲述着祖国建设的飞跃发展，归国的志愿军工程兵们向祖国亲人报告了他们在朝鲜停战以后积极帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设中的事迹。在火车离开以前，车上车下的人们一再互相鼓励，互相表示建设祖国的决心。
