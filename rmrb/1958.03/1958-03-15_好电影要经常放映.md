    Good Movies Should Be Shown Often
    Bingying, De Zheng North Road, Guangzhou
    In recent years, our country has produced many good films and dubbed many good foreign films. Domestic films such as "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," and "Children of China," and dubbed films such as "Chapayev," "The Great Citizen," and "The Rural Schoolteacher" have all been warmly welcomed by audiences and have had a very good influence on the masses. However, these good films, apart from being screened for a period of time during their initial release, are rarely shown in cinemas again. This not only reduces the utilization rate of these films, accumulates copies, prevents these films from fully exerting their educational role, but also fails to meet the demands of the audience—the masses never tire of watching good films; moreover, some viewers may not have the opportunity to see the films during their initial release.
    Theatrical troupes have repertory programs that are regularly performed. I think movies should also have repertory programs that are regularly shown. In terms of time allocation for the interlaced showing of new and old programs, movies have better conditions than stage performances. Because movies have more screenings per day, they can screen three or four new films on the same day and also take out one or two screenings to show good films that have already been screened.
    In order to fully exert the educational role of good films among the people, and to meet the demands of the broad masses of people in their cultural lives, I suggest that the film distribution department make planned arrangements so that good films can be shown often.

    好电影要经常放映
    广州德政北路　冰莹
    几年来我国拍摄了不少好影片，也译制了不少好影片。国产片如“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“中华女儿”等，译制片如“夏伯阳”、“伟大的公民”、“乡村女教师”等，都是受到观众热烈欢迎，在群众中起了很好的影响的。可是，这些好影片，除了首次上映时公映一段时间外，影院就很少再放映了。这样，不仅降低了这些影片使用率，积压了拷贝、使这些影片不能充分发挥它们的教育作用，同时也不能满足观众的要求——好影片群众是百看不厌的；何况有些观众在影片首次放映时，不一定有机会看到哩。
    剧团有保留节目经常上演，我想，电影也应该有保留节目经常放映。在新旧节目穿插上映的时间调配方面，电影是比较舞台演出有更好的条件的。因为电影每天放映的场数多，在同一天内，可以放映三四场新片，还可以抽出一两场的时间来放映已映过的好影片。
    为了充分发挥好影片在人民群众中的教育作用，为了满足广大人民群众在文化生活上的要求，建议电影发行部门有计划地安排一下，让好电影能经常放映。
