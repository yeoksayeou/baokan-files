Pingju Opera "Kindness and Enmity" Features Singing and Acting

The "Kindness and Enmity" performed by the China Pingju Opera House is a play worth watching.

Although the plot of this play is not very tortuous or complicated, the conflict of characters is attractive. Pingju audiences always want to hear some good singing and see good acting; there are characters in the play who are both admirable and hateful; Pingju's "Kindness and Enmity" can provide a certain degree of satisfaction in these aspects.

This play was adapted by the China Pingju Opera House from Yangzhou Opera. (Shu)

    评剧“恩与仇”有唱有做
    中国评剧院上演的“恩与仇”，是出有戏可看的戏。
    这出戏的情节虽不是很曲折复杂，但人物性格的冲突却是吸引人的。评剧观众总想听到几段好唱，看到好做工；有使人敬爱，也有使人憎恶的戏中人；这些，评剧“恩与仇”都能给与一定的满足。
    这个戏是由中国评剧院根据扬剧改编的。（树）
