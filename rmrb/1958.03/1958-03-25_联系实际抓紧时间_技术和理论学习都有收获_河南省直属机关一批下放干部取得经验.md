Integrating Theory with Practice and Seizing the Time
Technical and Theoretical Learning Both Yield Results
A Batch of Cadres Sent Down from Henan's Directly Subordinate Organs Gained Experience

(Reported by Henan Daily) The first batch of twenty-four cadres from Henan Province's directly subordinate organs who were sent down to Huanghua Township, Lin County, to participate in labor training have, over the past three months, persisted in studying current events, policies, theory, and culture amidst labor, and have achieved gratifying results.

In the heat of labor, they learned twelve kinds of production techniques (one to three for each person) from the peasants and grassroots cadres, such as sinking well shafts, building dams, making ridges, plowing, digging rocks, and applying topdressing fertilizer, as well as some valuable grassroots work experience. Seizing the time, they frequently read important articles in newspapers, editorials, and magazines such as "Study" and "China Youth," and read twenty-eight books including "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," dialectical materialism, historical materialism, common knowledge of philosophy, a brief biography of Lenin, the history of the Chinese revolution, and twelve lectures on youth cultivation.

When they first arrived, they focused their main energy on labor training (which was appropriate), and their thinking was not clear about taking the time to study theory and culture in their spare time. After debate, they unanimously agreed that: as newcomers to the "labor university," the focus of study should be on knowledge of the struggle for production and the struggle of classes, the excellent qualities and fine traditions of the working people, and grassroots work experience, combined with theoretical and cultural learning in their spare time. They first humbly learned production and class struggle knowledge from the peasants in the labor process. Li Zhaogong learned how to spot water sources and calculate the construction of flood control and water storage dams when repairing a reservoir. Zhang Shouyuan learned the experience of using stone rammers. Comrades in Weijiazhuang and Songjiazhuang established experimental fields together with commune cadres. Wang Cuirong studied wheat yield enhancement experience and corn and sweet potato intercropping techniques from books, preparing to discuss and experiment with commune members. Wang Xingmin joined the forestry team led by labor model Shi Hushan, studied Comrade Tan Zhenlin's report on soil and water conservation with the team members, boosted their enthusiasm, and mastered the technology. In less than a month, six team members dug more than nine hundred fish-scale pits. Everyone was extremely interested in this method of learning that combined theory with practice, and they became more and more energetic in their studies.

They carried out spare-time theoretical and cultural studies. The key to spare-time study is to cherish and make rational use of time. For example, use fragmented time to read newspapers, magazines, and literary books, and concentrated time to study theory. Li Feng and Lin Zefen from the Matizhang Agricultural Cooperative, and Liu Chuanqi and Yu Zhaomei from the Guo Family Agricultural Cooperative, were very good at using time before work, before meetings, before meals, and during field breaks to read newspapers, magazines, and literary works, and studied theory in the evenings. Many comrades combined their own studies with reading newspapers to the masses, which was very popular.

Everyone paid great attention to the method of learning that connects theory with practice. In the current rectification campaign of the whole people in the countryside, rectifying the Party, the League, and the commune, when they studied the "Anti-Rightist Album" and documents such as "How to Analyze Rural Classes," they connected it with the class dynamics of the masses in their villages during the big blooming and contended, clearly seeing the sharp struggle between two classes and two roads in the socialist revolution. They studied and participated in social activities simultaneously, combining book knowledge with practice, and also learned grassroots work experience. They deeply felt that this kind of learning was more effective than studying while sitting in an office.

    联系实际抓紧时间
    技术和理论学习都有收获
    河南省直属机关一批下放干部取得经验
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：河南省直属机关第一批下放到林县黄华乡参加劳动锻炼的二十四个干部，三个月来，在劳动中坚持了时事政策、理论文化的学习，取得了可喜的收获。
    在火热的劳动中，他们向农民和基层干部学会了打井筒、垒堰、打畦、犁地、掘地刨石头、施追肥等十二种生产技术（每人一至三种）和一些宝贵的基层工作经验。抓紧时间，经常阅读报纸社论、“学习”、“中国青年”等杂志上的重要文章，阅读“毛泽东选集”、辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义、哲学常识、列宁传略、中国革命史、青年修养十二讲等二十八册书籍。
    刚下来时，他们把主要精力放在劳动锻炼上（这是应该的），对抽出业余时间读书学习，思想不明确。经过争辩，一致认为：刚入劳动大学，学习应以生产斗争知识和阶级斗争知识、劳动人民的优秀品德和优良传统、基层工作经验等为主，结合进行业余的理论、文化学习。他们首先在劳动过程中虚心向农民学习生产和阶级斗争知识。李兆功在修水库时，学会了看水源，计算修筑拦洪蓄水坝等经验。张守源学会了打石夯的经验。在魏家庄、宋家庄的同志，和社干部一起建立了试验田。王翠荣学习了书本上的小麦丰产经验、玉米、红薯套种的技术，准备和社员商量进行试验。王醒民参加了劳动模范石虎山领导的林业队，和队员一起学习了谭震林同志关于水土保持的报告，鼓起了干劲，掌握了技术，不到一个月，六个队员挖九百多个鱼鳞坑。这种结合实际的学习方法，大家极感兴趣，越钻越有劲。
    他们开展了业余的理论和文化学习。业余学习的关键是爱惜和合理利用时间。如用零星的时间看报纸、杂志和文艺书籍，集中的时间学理论。马蹄掌农业社的李风、林则芬，郭家农业社的刘传奇、于兆美很善于利用上工前、开会前、饭前和田间休息时间看报纸、杂志和文艺作品，晚上学习理论。许多同志把自己学习和给群众读报结合起来，很受群众欢迎。
    大家非常注意理论联系实际的学习方法，在当前农村整党、整团、整社的全民整风运动中，他们在学习“反右专辑”以及学习“怎样分析农村阶级”等文件时，联系所在村群众在大鸣大放中的阶级动态，清楚地看到社会主义革命时期两个阶级、两条道路的尖锐斗争。他们一面学习，一面参加社会活动，把书本知识和实际结合起来，而且学习了基层工作经验。他们深切感到，这样学习，比坐在办公室里学习收效更大。
    中央建筑工程部华北直属工程公司下放到北京郊区西山农业社的干部耿天鹏，利用一切可利用的时间，从上月开始有计划地学习。这是他正利用晚上时间自学。　本报记者　刘长忠摄
