　　Special dispatch by Xin Hua News Agency: In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, Shanghai's literary and art circles have swept away obstacles and brought about a thriving situation where literature and art serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and creation and performance are flourishing. Whether writers, painters, playwrights, or musicians, they are now throwing themselves into the heated mass movement, implementing the combination of creation (performance), labor, and guidance (mass amateur art activities), and writing many works reflecting the great face of the era.

　　Shanghai's literary and art system used millions of big-character posters to expose the biggest waste in literary and art circles: under the constraints of bourgeois literary and artistic thought, the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers could not be well implemented, and the strength of the literary and art army could not be well brought into play. Extensive criticism and self-criticism unfolded on the big-character posters, with the criticism aimed at the four "separations" in literary and art circles: separation from politics, separation from reality, separation from the masses, and separation from labor. Some people not only separated from physical labor, but also separated from their own professional labor, not writing an article or composing a piece of music for several years. The big-character posters put forward the idea that "the situation is pressing," and the leaping forward situation in all aspects is forcing literary and art workers to catch up. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also proposed to literary and art circles the call of "working hard for three months to change the face." It was under such "internal and external attack" that a new situation began to appear in Shanghai's literary and art circles.

　　A large number of literary and art workers broke out of their small circles and threw themselves into the forefront of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. Wherever there were the most big-character posters in a factory, wherever a unit was leaping forward the fastest, there were literary and art workers and authors active among the masses. The Shanghai Art Theater, which had never created a script before, has now sent all its members except those performing in the theater to factories, and in a few days, they wrote three one-act plays and three living newspapers, and helped the railway workers' amateur theater troupe put on a five-act, six-scene living newspaper specially written for them. Composers and singers have recently created and sung more new songs than in the past year. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra is now also scattered in factories to play light music for workers. Pingtan artists, who used to perform traditional programs such as "Shuang Zhu Feng" and "Pearl Pagoda," are now also going deep into factories to create ballad singing that sings the praises of the Great Leap Forward. Several gray-haired traditional Chinese painters have also recently settled in factories, trying to combine traditional Chinese painting with arts and crafts, and opening up a road for traditional Chinese painting to combine with production and practicality, and better serve socialist construction.

　　When literary and art workers truly face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and implement the principle of popularization first, and improvement on the basis of popularization, many works that have appeared now, although most of them are rough, are more valuable than works that are divorced from reality because they come from life and from struggle. Many composers are more satisfied with the songs they recently made in a hurry than with those they racked their brains to compose in their rooms in the past. The large-scale living newspaper "Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves," written by three actors from the Shanghai People's Art Theater in three days and two nights, has received good reviews from many quarters, who believe that it can be turned into a multi-act play of considerable level on the basis of the living newspaper.

### 双反运动扫清了四个“脱离”  上海文艺界出现繁荣兴旺局面

    双反运动扫清了四个“脱离”
    上海文艺界出现繁荣兴旺局面
    本报特约新华社专稿　上海文艺界在反浪费反保守运动中，反出了一个文艺面向工农兵、创作演出大繁荣的兴旺局面。不论作家、画家、戏剧家和音乐家，现在正投身到火热的群众运动中去，实行创作（演出）、劳动、辅导（群众业余文艺活动）三者相结合，写出了许多反映时代伟大面貌的作品。
    上海文艺系统成百万张大字报揭露了文艺界的最大浪费：在资产阶级文艺思想的束缚下，文艺为工农兵服务的方针不能很好贯彻，文艺大军的力量不能很好发挥出来。大字报上展开了广泛的批评与自我批评，批评的锋芒针对着文艺界的四个“脱离”，即脱离政治，脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离劳动。有的人不仅脱离体力劳动，而且脱离本行的劳动，几年不写一篇文章，不作一个曲子。大字报上提出了“形势逼人”，各方面的跃进形势逼着文艺工作者去迎头赶上，中共上海市委并且向文艺界提出了“苦干三月，改变面貌”的号召。就在这样的“内外夹攻”之下，上海文艺界开始出现了一个新的局面。
    大批文艺工作者闯出了自己的小圈子，投入了反浪费、反保守运动的最前线。哪个工厂大字报最多，哪个单位跃进得最快，哪儿就有文艺工作者、作者活跃在群众中间。从来没有创作过剧本的上海艺术剧院，现在除了剧场演出人员之外，全部下到工厂去，几天内就写了三个独幕剧和三个活报剧，并且帮助铁路工人业余剧团排出一个特地为他们写的五幕六场的活报剧。作曲家和演唱家最近创作和演唱的新歌，比过去一年还要多。上海交响乐团，现在也分散到工厂为工人演奏轻音乐。过去经常演唱“双珠凤”、“珍珠塔”等传统节目的评弹艺人，现在也深入工厂，创作了歌颂大跃进的弹词。好几位白发苍苍的国画家，最近也在工厂落户，尝试把国画与工艺美术相结合，开拓出一条国画结合生产和实用，更好地为社会主义建设服务的道路。
    当文艺工作者真正面向了工农兵，实行以普及为主，在普及的基础上提高之后，现在出现的许多作品，虽然大部分都很粗糙，但是由于来自生活，来自斗争，也比脱离实际的作品宝贵。许多作曲家对最近匆促间作出的曲子，比过去关在房间内花尽脑汁作出的满意，上海人民艺术剧院三个演员赶了三天两夜写出的大型活报剧“乘风破浪”，获得了很多方面的好评，认为在活报剧的基础上可以改成一个相当水平的多幕剧。
