    Taking the Road of Integrating Theory with Practice
    Zu Nian
    Integrating theory with practice is a fundamental issue that our academic circles must resolve.
    Professor Yang Hui'an, director of the Horticulture Department of Huazhong Agricultural College, has steadfastly maintained close contact with farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan in the past few years, often going to the fields to study and solve production problems with farmers, summarize farmers' production experiences, and promote agricultural science and technology, thereby enriching the content of his teaching and scientific experiments. Professor Yang Hui'an is on the right path.
    Integrating theory with practice and separating theory from practice are two opposing academic ideological systems, and their emergence has class roots. Integrating theory with practice is a truth that the proletariat has always adhered to. The working people need theory to solve problems in production and life, and at the same time, they distinguish the truth and falsehood of theory based on their practical experience. Therefore, they value practice. This is a simple and correct materialism. Labor practice is the source of production knowledge, and theory and practice are like fish and water; fish will lose their lives without water. Separating theory from practice is a characteristic of bourgeois academic thought. Because of their class nature, they regard theory and cultural knowledge as capital. Having culture and knowledge makes them superior, and they can use this to profit. Therefore, they inevitably despise labor and the working people, and inevitably separate theory from practice.
    Professor Yang Hui'an is taking the former path, the path of integrating theory and practice, so he has achieved success. Facts have proved that this path is not only suitable for agricultural scientists but also applicable to scientists engaged in social sciences, natural sciences, and other fields. However, regrettably, the ideological problem has not been truly solved among some scientists and professors regarding this correct path. Their so-called "academic style" is to teach behind closed doors and conduct scientific research behind closed doors. They even say that Professor Yang Hui'an's method is merely a method of "cultivating labor models," calling him a "native professor." They demand that Professor Yang Hui'an abandon practice and only conduct so-called "profound" research in the laboratory. However, the research method of separating from the masses and separating from practice will inevitably limit the improvement of teaching standards and scientific research quality. There is such a professor who has been engaged in the study of electrical engineering for decades, but when he actually operates the machine himself, he burns out several electric meters in a row. The students trained by such teachers will be "talents" who are neither red nor expert and can talk but not do.
    Currently, a magnificent anti-rightist campaign is being launched in universities. Let this raging fire burn away the bourgeois educational thought of separating from the masses and separating from practice in teaching.

    走理论联系实际的道路
    祖年
    理论联系实际，是我国学术界必须解决的一个根本性质的问题。
    华中农学院园艺系主任杨惠安教授，几年来踏踏实实地始终坚持和武汉市郊区农民密切联系，经常到田间和农民一起研究和解决生产问题，总结农民的生产经验，推广农业科学技术，从而丰富了自己的教学和科学试验的内容。杨惠安教授的这条路是走对了。
    理论联系实际和理论脱离实际，是两个对立的学术思想体系，它的产生是有阶级根源的。理论联系实际是无产阶级一贯坚持的真理。劳动人民需要理论是为了解决生产和生活中的问题，同时他们辨别理论的真伪也是从他们的实际经验出发。因此他们重视实际。这是朴素的又是正确的唯物主义。劳动实践是生产知识的源泉，理论和实际，有如鱼和水；鱼离开了水就要失去生命。理论脱离实际是资产阶级学术思想的特点。因为他们阶级本性的原因，他们把理论，把文化知识当作资本。有文化有知识就高人一等，并且可以据此以谋利。因此，他们必然轻视劳动，轻视劳动人民，必然理论脱离实际。
    杨惠安教授走的是前者，是理论和实际结合的道路，所以他获得了成功。事实证明，这条道路，不仅适合农业科学家，对于从事研究社会科学、自然科学等科学家来说，也同样适用。但是，遗憾的是，对于这条正确道路，在一些科学家、教授当中，思想上并没有真正解决问题。这些人所谓的“学术风气”是关起门来教书，关起门来进行科学研究工作。他们甚至说杨惠安教授采取的方法仅仅是“培养劳动模范”的办法，称他为“土教授”。他们要求杨惠安教授脱离实际，只在实验室里进行所谓“高深”的研究。但是，脱离广大群众，脱离实际的研究方法，这必然限制教学水平和科学研究质量的提高。有这样一位教授，他从事研究电机学几十年，但是当他自己实际操作机器时，一连烧坏了好几个电表。这样的教师培养出来的学生，将会是不红不专、能说不能作的“人材”。
    目前，在高等学校里正掀起一个规模壮阔的双反运动，让这把熊熊的烈火，烧掉教学中脱离群众、脱离实际的资产阶级教育思想吧。
