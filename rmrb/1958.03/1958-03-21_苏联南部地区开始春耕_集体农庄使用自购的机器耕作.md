    Spring Ploughing Begins in Southern Soviet Union
    Collective Farms Use Self-Purchased Machinery for Tillage

    (Reported by this newspaper) The fields in the southern Soviet Union have been awakened by the spring breeze. Collective farms in the Odessa Oblast have started spring ploughing. Different from previous years, some farms are using their own machinery for tillage this year. This shows that agricultural workers not only warmly support the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party's decision on reorganizing tractor stations, but have also begun to put it into practice.

    For example, the six collective farms served by the Ovidiopol Machine Tractor Station in the Odessa Oblast now all have their own tractors, combine harvesters, and other machinery. The Dzerzhinsky Collective Farm used 500,000 rubles from its public accumulation fund to purchase the machinery and has already used it to sow the first batch of seeds this spring. Collective farms in the Kotovsk District have also begun to purchase machinery in large quantities. For example, the "Fortieth Anniversary of the October Revolution" Collective Farm bought all the machinery it needed, including 14 tractors, 18 seeders, and 15 cultivators, and has already paid 700,000 rubles. Other collective farms such as "Progress" and "Road to Communism" have also purchased machinery from tractor stations for hundreds of thousands of rubles.

    苏联南部地区开始春耕
    集体农庄使用自购的机器耕作
    本报讯　苏联南部的田地已被春风吹醒。敖德萨州的集体农庄开始了春耕。今年春耕与往年不同的是，有些农庄是用自己的机器耕种的。这说明农业劳动者不仅热烈拥护苏共中央关于改组拖拉机站的决议，而且已经开始付诸实施了。
    例如，敖德萨州的奥维地阿波里机器拖拉机站所服务的六个集体农庄，都已经有了自己的拖拉机、收割联合机和其他机器。捷尔仁斯基集体农庄用五十万卢布的公积金买下了机器，并且已用它们播下了今春的第一批种子。科托夫区的农庄也开始大量购买机器。如“十月革命四十年”集体农庄买了农庄所需要的全部机器，计有十四部拖拉机，十八架播种机，十五部中耕机等，并且已经交付了七十万卢布。其他“进步”、“共产主义之路”等农庄，也都用几十万卢布从拖拉机站购买了机器。
