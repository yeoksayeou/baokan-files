    Should I Retire to Do Housework?
    Retirement is Not Unemployment
    This time, for the overall benefit of the 600 million people, in the streamlining of institutions, besides some female comrades with many children retiring to do housework, some male comrades also applied for retirement in response to the call because their physical conditions were not suitable for work in government offices. I am one of them. However, in the days before and after retirement, there was an extremely wrong idea from family to society that "retirement is unemployment" and "from then on, I will become a parasite on society."
    Today's retirement and unemployment in the old society are two completely different things in essence, and I have a deep understanding of this. I am fifty years old this year, and I have suffered countless times from the pain of unemployment in the old society. Let me just list two of them: Once, in 1926, when I had been an apprentice in the private Asian Company in Bengbu for two years, because my family was poor and I had lost the opportunity to study when I was young, I was eager to learn and always seized the time to study culture. I was criticized by the manager for studying during the day, and I changed to studying at night and late at night, and I was scolded for not doing my job properly and wasting electricity and disturbing people's dreams. At the end of the year, I was dismissed on the pretext of the unstable situation. The other time was at the end of 1945, when I was working in the Yiyun Office of the pseudo-Northwest Highway Bureau. Because my "backer" lost power, I received a "resignation approved" notice out of thin air. At that time, it was not long after the Japanese surrender, and I dragged my family around Chongqing, living off our savings. It took me three months of begging relatives and friends to return to my hometown. This situation is still vivid in my mind.
    In the eight or nine years since liberation, the unemployed left over from the old society have been basically resettled by 1957 under the care of the Party, along with the needs of socialist construction. In socialist society, everyone gives full play to their talents and gets what they deserve. The word "unemployment" has disappeared forever with the death of the old society.
    This retirement of a group of people is for the better construction of socialism. It is a correct measure that benefits both the interests of the country and the interests of the individual. It is also a reasonable arrangement to redistribute the labor of some people at a certain period in accordance with the law of metabolism. The result of reducing the number of people in institutions and enterprises is to save state expenditure, and the result of retaining the strong and eliminating the weak is to improve work efficiency. In this way, socialist construction is accelerated, which is consistent with individual interests. Furthermore, the retired people have been educated by the Party for many years, and they all have a certain theoretical level and political consciousness. Except for those who are old, sick and have indeed lost their ability to work, as long as they adhere to the revolutionary stand of serving the people, they are still useful forces in socialist construction whether they participate in agricultural labor in rural areas or participate in street work in cities.
    Since I joined the revolution, I have suffered from severe bone tuberculosis for three years. I would have been unemployed and died of poverty and disease in the old society, but under the Party's kind care, I not only recovered from the disease, but also maintained the lives of my family of nine and the studies of my children as usual for three years. Three of my five children and one niece have graduated from universities and secondary schools and have joined the workforce under the Party's education. All of this is something unimaginable in the old society. Now that I am retiring because of my weakness and unsuitability for work in government offices, the government is also giving me a retirement bonus. Under the principle of thrift and frugality, life will not be too difficult. In the future, the income from my children's work will be enough to make up for it, and the local government will also take care of me (of course, I cannot be dependent on it). I deeply feel that the new society is a revolutionary big family, and the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party, the government and the people is something unimaginable in the old society. Now I am preparing to continue my theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism in a planned way, and I will actively participate in and strive to do all social work, and I will also learn some production skills. I am moving forward with full confidence as before.

### 该不该退职回家从事家务劳动？  退职不是失业

    该不该退职回家从事家务劳动？
    退职不是失业
    这次为了六亿人民的整体利益，在精简机构中，除了有些多子女的女同志退职回家从事家务劳动外，还有一部分男同志因为身体条件不适宜机关工作，也响应号召申请退职了。我就是其中的一个。但在退职前后的日子里，从家庭到社会上都有一种“退职就是失业”、“从此就成为社会上的寄生虫”等极端错误的说法。
    今天的退职和旧社会的失业，在本质上是绝然不同的两回事，我是有深刻体会的。我今年五十岁，饱尝过旧社会无数次的失业痛苦，随便列举其中的两次吧：一次是1926年在蚌埠私营亚洲公司已经当了两年练习生的时候，由于我家贫幼小失学，求知心切，日常总是抓工夫学习文化，白天学遭到经理的斥责，改夜晚学深夜学，又被骂为不务正业和开灯费电扰人清梦，到年底就借口时局不靖辞退了。另一次是1945年底，在伪西北公路局驿运处工作时，因为我的“靠山”失了势，就凭空来了个“辞职照准”的通知。这时正当日军投降不久，我拖着一家大小失业在重庆坐吃山空，好容易求亲告友奔走了三个月才得回归家乡。此情此景，历历在目。
    解放八、九年来，旧社会所遗留下来的失业人员，在党的关怀下，到1957年止，随着社会主义建设的需要已基本上得到安置。在社会主义社会里，人尽其才各得其所，“失业”这个词汇已随旧社会的死亡而永远消灭。
    这次退职一批人员，是为了更好的建设社会主义，是国家利益和个人利益两得其宜的正确措施，也是在一定时期依照新陈代谢的规律把一部分人的劳动重行一次分工的合理安排。减少机关企业人员的结果是节省了国家开支，留强去弱的结果是提高了工作效率，这样社会主义建设加快了，和个人利益是一致的。再说退职人员都受到过党的多年教育，都具有一定的理论水平和政治觉悟，除年老多病确已丧失劳动能力者外，只要自己坚持着为人民服务的革命立场，退职后无论到农村参加农业劳动或在城市参加街道工作，都依然是社会主义建设中的有用力量。
    我参加革命以来，曾患过三年严重的骨结核病，要在旧社会早就失业贫病死去，可是我在党的亲切关怀下不但治好了病，三年里还照常维持我一家九口人的生活和子女学习。五个子女一个侄女就在党的教养下已经有三个大中学毕业参加工作了。凡此都是旧社会梦想不到的事。现在我因为体弱不适宜机关工作而退职，政府还发给一笔退职金。在勤俭持家省吃俭用的原则下，生活不会有多大困难。以后还有子女工作收入足资弥补，地方政府也会照顾（当然不能心存依赖）。我深深感到，新社会就是一个革命大家庭，党、政府和人民之间血肉相连的关系，是旧社会难以想像的事情。现在我准备有计划的继续马克思列宁主义的理论学习，并要积极参加和努力做好一切社会工作，还要学会一些生产技能。我同从前一样信心百倍地朝前走着。
