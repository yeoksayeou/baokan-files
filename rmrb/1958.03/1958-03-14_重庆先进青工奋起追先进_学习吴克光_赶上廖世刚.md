Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th: More than two hundred young advanced producers from factories and mines in Chongqing unanimously proposed an initiative at the city's youth advanced producers conference on the 9th: to learn from Wu Keguang and catch up with Liao Shigang.

	Liao Shigang is an outstanding young worker at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory. At the city's advanced producers representative conference in February this year, based on his new measures to reform production technology, he proposed an advanced plan: to adopt multi-machine management methods to increase the production efficiency of the lathes he manages by twelve times the quota, doing thirteen days of work in one day. Recently, he found new tricks, and at the city's youth advanced producers conference held on the 9th, he put forward an even more advanced plan: to increase production efficiency by twenty-five times the quota, doing twenty-six days of work in one day.

	Wu Keguang is also an outstanding young worker at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory. From 1955 to the present, he has overfulfilled his plan every month and has been rated as an advanced producer for twelve consecutive quarters. Now he has proposed to complete five years of work in two years. Every time Wu Keguang greatly exceeded the quota after improving his technology, he would take the initiative to ask the administration to increase his quota, take less or no bonus. He also often took the time to help others and tried to improve collective production. The group he was in had more than thirty processes, of which twenty were improved by him, greatly increasing the production of the whole group.

    重庆先进青工奋起追先进
    学习吴克光  赶上廖世刚
    据新华社重庆11日电  重庆市厂矿企业两百多名青年先进生产者，9日在全市青年先进生产者会上一致提出倡议：要学习吴克光，赶上廖世刚。
    廖世刚是重庆建设机床厂的优秀青年工人。他在今年2月全市先进生产者代表会上，根据自己改革生产技术的新措施，提出了一个先进计划：采用多机床管理办法，把他所管理的车床的生产效率比定额提高十二倍，在一天内做十三天的活。最近，他又找到了新的窍门，在9日召开的全市青年先进生产者会上提出了更先进的计划：使生产效率比定额提高二十五倍，一天做二十六天的活。
    吴克光也是重庆建设机床厂的优秀青年工人。他从1955年到现在，月月超额完成计划，连续十二个季度被评为先进生产者。现在他又提出：要在两年内完成五年的工作量。吴克光每次改进技术大大突破定额以后，就主动要求行政上提高他的定额，少拿或不拿奖金。他还经常抽出时间帮助别人，尽量把集体生产搞好。他所在的小组有三十多道工序，其中二十几道都经他帮助改进了生产技术，全组生产大有提高。
