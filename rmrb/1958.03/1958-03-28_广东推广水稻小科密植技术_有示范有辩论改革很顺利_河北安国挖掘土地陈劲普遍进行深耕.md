Guangzhou, March 27 (From Our Newspaper) The central content of Guangdong Province's spring plowing technical reform is to advance the transplanting of rice seedlings and comprehensively promote close planting of small clumps. In this transplanting technical reform, all localities have implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "fully mobilizing the masses and going through experiments in everything," universally organizing cadres from the township, cooperative, and team levels to conduct trial planting demonstrations, on-site debates, and step-by-step promotion, mutual comparisons, so that cadres and the masses alike not only solve ideological problems but also generally understand technical specifications; both early transplanting and close planting are implemented, and technical quality is guaranteed.

	The Pearl River Delta generally transplanted rice seedlings twenty-five days earlier than last year. At the beginning of transplanting, cadres at the county, township, and cooperative levels, and even production team leaders, organized trial planting at each level, made demonstrations, launched debates at the fields, and imparted advanced technology, so that the technical reform was truly implemented to the end. In Zhongshan County, three or four days after transplanting in the demonstration fields, the seedlings straightened up and turned green, forcing many people who originally opposed early transplanting and close planting to submit to the facts. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in this county universally organized debates, checking past high-yield records and the reasons for high yields, checking this year's favorable conditions, calculating the benefits of early transplanting and close planting, and refuting various right-leaning conservative arguments. Panyu County universally adopted the method of comparing the retrogression of the 1957 technical reform with the leap forward of the 1956 technical reform to conduct debates.

	The Chao-Shan Plain and the Shaoguan, Gaoyao, Huiyang, Hepu, and Zhanjiang regions, which are high-yield grain areas, also started transplanting fifteen to twenty days earlier, universally adopting the above-mentioned mass line method to implement appropriate close planting. The counties in the Chao-Shan Plain have very high requirements for transplanting technical specifications, proposing to implement technical reforms by 100%, and re-transplant those that do not meet the specifications.

	In the process of carrying out transplanting technical reforms, rural cadres at all levels in Guangdong Province not only ensured that the first battle of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production would be fought brilliantly, but also learned some agricultural technologies themselves and improved their ability to lead agricultural production.

	From Our Newspaper: Under the slogan of "Striving for a Thousand Catties of Grain, a Great Turnaround in Cultivation," more than 100,000 farmers in An Guo County, Hebei Province, mobilized to deeply plow all 300,000 mu of spring-sown land in the county using tools such as iron picks to a depth of 1.2 to 1.5 chi, creating a miracle of a great turnaround in cultivation.

	A great turnaround in cultivation is the first heartening good news from An Guo in its effort to further leap over the Yangtze River this year. Last year, the per-mu yield of grain in An Guo County had already reached more than 460 catties. This year, it is proposed to strive for 1,000 catties of grain, 10,000 catties of sweet potatoes, and 100 catties of cotton per mu. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to building water conservancy projects and accumulating fertilizer, the measure of deeply plowing the land was proposed. Liu Zhenzong, Secretary of the An Guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that deep plowing can increase production by more than 30%. This experience was gained last year. Last year, one cooperative in Fuluo Township, An Guo, deeply plowed ten mu of land to a depth of 1.2 chi. The average yield of corn per mu was 600 catties, while the land with the same soil quality, fertilization, and cultivation that was not deeply plowed only produced more than 400 catties per mu. All old farmers understand the principle of deep plowing increasing production. They say that this can unleash the land's old vigor.

	Last winter, An Guo widely publicized the facts of plowing increasing production, calculated the accounts of increased production and labor, and aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the county's farmers. The county launched the first upsurge of plowing, with 100,000 male and female farmers working day and night, regardless of wind and snow, and deeply plowed 190,000 mu of cultivated land.

	During the Spring Festival this year, An Guo County launched a second upsurge of crash plowing. More than 100,000 male and female farmers again spent a week crash plowing more than 100,000 mu. After the high tide of production turned to wheat field management, another 30,000 mu were plowed. All spring land that should be cultivated in the county, except for that reserved for mechanized cultivation, has been deeply plowed. Now, most of these cultivated lands have been rolled and harrowed, and some have already been planted with early-maturing crops.

    广东推广水稻小科密植技术
    有示范有辩论改革很顺利
    河北安国挖掘土地陈劲普遍进行深耕
    本报广州27日电　当前广东省春耕技术改革的中心内容是提早插秧和全面推广小科密植。在这次插秧技术改革中，各地贯彻了毛主席指示的“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的精神，普遍通过分别集中乡、社、队的干部，层层试插示范，现场辩论，逐级推广，互相评比，做到从干部到群众，既解决思想问题，又大体懂得技术规格；既实行了早插、密植，又保证了技术质量。
    珠江三角洲今年插秧普遍比去年提早二十五天。插秧开始时，县、乡、社的干部以至生产队长层层组织试插，做出示范，在田头展开辩论和传授先进技术，使技术改革真正贯彻到底。中山县的示范田，插秧后三、四天，秧苗就直身回青，使原来许多反对早插、密植的人在事实面前不得不服。同时，这个县的农业社普遍组织辩论，通过查过去的高产纪录和高产原因，查今年的有利条件，算早插和密植的好处，驳倒了各种右倾保守的论调。番禺县则普遍采用查1957年技术改革倒退与1956年技术改革跃进对比的方法进行辩论。
    粮食高产区的潮汕平原和韶关、高要、惠阳、合浦、湛江等专区也提前十五天到二十天开始插秧，普遍采用上述走群众路线的方法实行适当密植。潮汕平原各县对插秧技术规格要求很高，提出要百分之百贯彻技术改革，检查出不合规格的就返工再插。
    广东省各级农村干部在进行插秧技术改革中，不但保证了今年农业生产大跃进的第一仗打得出色，而且使自己学会了一些农业技术，提高了领导农业生产的本领。

    本报讯　河北安国县在“争取产千斤、耕地大翻身”的口号下，十万多农民总动员起来，把全县三十多万亩春播耕地用铁镐等工具深翻了一点二尺到一点五尺，创造了耕地大翻身的奇迹。
    耕地大翻身，是安国争取今年进一步跃过长江传出的第一个振奋人心的捷报。安国县去年粮食亩产已经达到了四百六十多斤，今年提出要争取千斤粮、万斤薯和百斤棉。为争取实现这个目标，除兴修水利和积肥以外，提出了深翻耕地的措施。中共安国县委书记刘振宗说，深翻耕地可以增产30％以上，这个经验是去年取得的。去年安国伏罗乡一个社深翻了十亩地，深翻一尺二，每亩玉米平均产六百斤，而同样的土质、同样施肥和耕作的没有深翻的地每亩却只产四百多斤。深翻增产的道理是所有老农都懂的，他们说这样可以发挥土地的陈劲。
    去年冬天，安国广泛宣传了翻地增产的事实，算了增产账和劳力账，鼓起了全县农民的革命干劲。全县掀起了第一次翻地高潮，十万男女农民昼夜突击，风雪不停，深翻了十九万亩耕地。
    今年春节安国县又发动了第二次突击翻地高潮。十万多男女农民又以一周时间突击翻了十万多亩。生产高潮转入麦田管理后又翻了三万多亩。全县应耕春地除留待机耕的外，全部深耕完毕。现在，这些耕地大部都轧、耙过了，部分已经种了早熟作物。
