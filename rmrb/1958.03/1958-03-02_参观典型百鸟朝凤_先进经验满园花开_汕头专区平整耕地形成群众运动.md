    Visiting a Model, All Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix
    Advanced Experiences Bloom Everywhere
    Shantou Prefecture's Leveling of Farmland Forms a Mass Movement

    (Our report) The Southern Daily News reports: Shantou Prefecture in Guangdong Province seized upon the typical advanced experience of leveling farmland from the Guanshan Agricultural Cooperative in Chenghai County, and organized large-scale visits and comparisons to promote it on the ground. In just over a month, this advanced experience in leveling farmland has spread to fifteen counties and two suburban districts in Shantou Prefecture, forming a massive mass movement. According to statistics up to February 17, the area of cultivated land that has been reorganized and improved throughout the region has reached 1.44 million mu, and efforts are being made to change the face of more than 6 million mu of cultivated land in the entire prefecture this year.

    Leveling farmland was originally only suitable for plains areas, but recently, amidst the cries of breaking conventions, the Qipan Agricultural Cooperative in the hilly areas of Jieyang County creatively combined the experiences of Liling Township and Guanshan Cooperative. While realizing water conservancy on dry garden slopes, they adopted methods such as turning soil into grids, replacing with "guest soil", leveling high slopes, filling lowlands, moving graves, and applying more fertilizer to comprehensively reorganize the dry garden slopes. This found a concrete form for promoting the experience of leveling farmland in near-mountain and hilly areas.

    After summarizing the experiences of Guanshan Cooperative and Qipan Cooperative, the CPC Shantou Prefectural Committee immediately promoted them to agricultural cooperatives in various regions. Luo Tian, the first secretary of the prefectural committee, and Liang Jixiang, the secretary, personally led and organized cadres at all levels to visit. Among them, more than 40,000 people visited Guanshan Cooperative, and thousands visited Qipan Cooperative. Almost everyone who visited was amazed by the revolutionary vigor of these two cooperatives, and from this, examined their own ideological backwardness in relation to objective reality. After visiting, more than 300 cadres from Tuopu Township in Chenghai County held a meeting on the spot to compare conditions, compare energy, criticize right-leaning conservative ideas, and immediately formulated a plan, organizing actions after returning to their hometowns. After visiting, more than 4,000 cadres in Chenghai County quickly revised the plan for leveling farmland and improving soil from the original 100,000 mu to 200,000 mu. In Qian Dong Township, Raoping County, 4,600 people were mobilized in three days to level 1,400 mu of cultivated land. In order to keep the leveling of farmland moving forward wave upon wave, all localities have also made comprehensive plans and short-term arrangements, and constantly carried out labor competitions through inspection and evaluation to encourage the labor enthusiasm of the masses.

    参观典型百鸟朝凤
    先进经验满园花开
    汕头专区平整耕地形成群众运动
    本报讯　南方日报消息：广东省汕头专区抓住澄海县冠山农业社平整耕地的典型先进经验，大规模组织参观、评比，实地推广。一个多月来，这个平整耕地的先进经验，已经普及于汕头专区十五个县和两个市郊区，形成一个规模浩大的群众性运动。到2月17日的统计，全区经过整理和改良的耕地已达一百四十四万亩，并争取在今年内把全专区六百多万亩耕地的面貌改变过来。
    平整耕地原来只适宜于平原地区，但最近在突破常规的声浪中，揭阳县丘陵地区的棋盘农业社创造性地把沥林乡和冠山社的经验结合起来，在实现旱园坡地水利化的同时，采取翻土格、换客土、平高埔、填低地、搬坟墓、多施肥等办法，对旱园坡地进行综合整理，为平整耕地的经验在近山和丘陵地区推广找到具体形式。
    中共汕头地方委员会总结冠山社和棋盘社的经验后，立即向各地区的农业社推广。地委第一书记罗天和书记梁集祥亲自带领和组织各级干部去参观。其中参观冠山社的四万多人，参观棋盘社的数千人。参观的人几乎没有一个不惊叹这两个社的革命干劲，并由此检讨自己的思想落后于客观实际。澄海县鮀浦乡三百多名干部参观后，就地召开会议，比条件，比干劲，批判右倾保守思想，当场就订出计划，回乡后就组织行动。澄海县四千多名干部参观后，很快就把平整耕地和改良土壤的计划从原来的十万亩修改为二十万亩。饶平县钱东乡三天之中就出动四千六百人，平整耕地一千四百亩。为了使平整耕地运动后浪推前浪地持续下去，各地还做到全面规划和短期安排，并不断通过检查评比，开展劳动竞赛，来鼓舞群众的劳动热情。
