Wall Street Lawyers
Politicians, businessmen, and lawyers are a trinity.
    In the commercial district of New York City, more than twenty large and small, important law firms employ over one thousand seven hundred lawyers who loyally serve the monopoly capitalists. These firms are not entirely located on Wall Street, but because they are closely linked to the bosses of Wall Street, Americans commonly refer to the lawyers of these firms as Wall Street lawyers.
    From a recent article in the American magazine "Fortune" about Wall Street lawyers, it is easy to see the trinity of American politicians, businessmen, and lawyers. It is impossible to count the number of Wall Street lawyers who have taken up important positions in the political and business worlds. Former Secretary of State Stimson, current Secretary of State Dulles, and former New York Governor Dewey have all served as Wall Street lawyers. Managers of large enterprises such as U.S. Steel, Morgan Company, Chrysler Motors, International Nickel Company, and Manhattan Chase Bank were all key figures in Wall Street law firms in the past. There are also individuals who currently practice law on Wall Street and hold positions as directors in several large companies. For example, Arthur Dean, who succeeded Dulles as the main lawyer of the Wall Street law firm "Sullivan & Cromwell," currently serves as a director in eight large companies.

    Specializing in Monopoly Lawsuits
    Wall Street lawyers are experts at handling monopoly lawsuits. They are the most loyal agents of the monopoly capitalists. One Wall Street lawyer said:
    "Take the issue of corporate mergers, for example. When a company plans to merge with another company, it needs to know whether it will violate Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act. This is a tricky issue. However, we are experts in this field. Since 1950, we have handled many cases of this kind. We understand the law, and we understand the consequences of the law. Moreover, we know all the relevant judges… Our job is to know what the judges are thinking."
    Handling the registration of stock issuance for monopoly capitalists is also an important business for Wall Street lawyers. "Fortune" magazine quoted a Wall Street lawyer's confession: "Anyone can read the regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But most of the actual work is understanding it between the lines. And we are experts in this area."

    A Way to Make Money, A Skill in Using People
    According to "Fortune" magazine statistics, the larger Wall Street law firms have an annual income of approximately four million to six million US dollars. Lawyer consultation fees sometimes reach as high as one hundred US dollars per hour.
    The main sources of Wall Street lawyers are the law schools of Harvard, Yale, and Columbia Universities. Wall Street law firms also have their special standards for selecting "talent." "Fortune" magazine quoted an old Wall Street lawyer as saying: "Outstanding intelligence is not the main thing." "Too much imagination, too much wit and cleverness, too much agility, if lacking a sense of balance that has an impact, will hinder success rather than promote it." In other words, what monopoly capitalists need are only docile and unreserved slaves.

### 华尔街的律师

    华尔街的律师
    政客、商人、律师三位一体
    纽约市商业区二十余所大大小小的、重要的律师事务所，雇用着一千七百多名忠心耿耿为垄断资本家服务的律师。这些事务所并不完全设在华尔街，但是由于它们与华尔街的老板们骨肉相连，美国人就把这些事务所的律师通称为华尔街的律师。
    从美国“幸福”杂志最近的一篇报道华尔街律师的专文里，不难看出美国政客、商人、律师三位一体的情况。华尔街律师出任政界及商界要职的不可胜数。昔日的国务卿史汀生，今日的国务卿杜勒斯，前任纽约州州长杜威都充当过华尔街律师。美国钢铁公司、摩根公司、克莱斯勒汽车公司、国际镍公司、曼哈顿大通银行等大企业的经理都是昔日华尔街律师事务所的要角。还有一种目前在华尔街执行律师业务、而身兼若干大公司董事职务的人物，例如，继杜勒斯之后、担任华尔街“苏利文·克伦威尔”律师事务所主要律师的阿瑟·狄恩，现在兼任着八个大公司的董事。
    专打垄断官司
    华尔街的律师是专打垄断官司的能手。他们是垄断资本家最忠实的代理人。有一位华尔街的律师说：
    “试以公司合并问题为例。当一个公司筹划与另一个公司合并的时候，它要知道是否会违犯克莱顿反托辣斯法案第七条。这是一个棘手的问题。不过，我们是这方面的专家。自从1950年以来，我们经办过许多这一类的案件。我们懂得法律，我们体会得出法律的后果如何。而且，我们认识所有的有关法官……我们的工作就是要去知道法官们想的是什么。”
    代理垄断资本家办理发行股票登记事宜，也是华尔街律师的一个重要的业务。“幸福”杂志报道了一位华尔街律师的自供：“谁都会阅读股票交易委员会所订的规章。但是绝大部分的实际工作是从字里行间去了解它。而我们就是这方面的专家。”
    生财有道　用人有术
    据“幸福”杂志统计，华尔街较大的律师事务所，每年收入约为四百万美元至六百万美元。律师谈话费有时高达每小时一百美元。
    华尔街律师主要的供应地是哈佛、耶鲁、哥伦比亚几个大学的法学院。华尔街律师事务所选拔“人材”也有它们的特别标准。“幸福”杂志引用一位华尔街律师老前辈的话说：“杰出的智力并不是主要的。”“过于丰富的想像、过多的机智和聪明、过度的伶俐，如果缺乏一种起影响作用的平衡感，就会阻碍成功，而不是促进成功。”换而言之，垄断资本家所需要的只是俯首听命、不折不扣的奴才。
