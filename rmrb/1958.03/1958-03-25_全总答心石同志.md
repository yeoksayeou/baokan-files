    All-China Federation of Trade Unions' Response to Comrade Xinshi
    On January 31st, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Comrade Xinshi, arguing that "sick leave wages should not be paid based on piece-rate wages." We believe that Comrade Xinshi's opinion is reasonable. Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of the Labor Insurance Regulations stipulates: "For workers and staff whose wages are calculated on a piece-rate basis, when enjoying labor insurance benefits, if calculated based on their own wages, the calculation standard shall be the average daily wage of the worker or staff member for the most recent three months. If the total working time is less than three months, the calculation standard shall be the average daily wage of the worker or staff member for the actual working days. However, for sick leave of seven days or less, the average daily wage of the previous month may be used as the calculation standard." However, judging from the implementation, this provision is not appropriate and is prone to problems. As Comrade Xinshi pointed out, the labor insurance benefits received by employees who stop working due to sick leave may be more than the wages earned by production workers if this regulation is implemented. Therefore, we intend to suggest that the government appropriately amend this provision. Before the amendment, regarding the payment of labor insurance benefits to employees receiving piece-rate wages, we believe that in principle, the calculation standard should be the average monthly wage of the worker or staff member for the most recent three months, but it should not be higher than the average piece-rate wage of production workers of the same grade (or in the same team or group) in the current month.

    全总答心石同志
    1月31日，人民日报刊登读者心石同志来信，认为“病假工资不能按计件工资支付。”我们认为心石同志的意见有道理。劳动保险条例实施细则第八条规定：“工人、职员的工资按件计算者，享受劳动保险待遇时，如按本人工资计算，均以该工人职员最近三个月的每日平均工资为计算标准，如全部工作时间不满三个月者，应以该工人职员实际工作日的每日平均工资为计算标准。但病伤假期在七日以内者，得以上月份每日平均工资为计算标准”。但从执行当中看来，这条规定不够妥当，容易发生毛病。正如心石同志所指出的，执行这项规定，因病假停止工作的职工所领取的劳动保险待遇，可能比生产职工拿的工资还要多。因此，我们准备建议政府适当修改这一条规定。在修改前，对于支付领取计件工资的职工的劳动保险待遇，我们认为在原则上应以该工人职员最近三个月的每月平均工资为计算标准，但不得高于当月该工种（或该班、组）同级的生产工人的平均计件工资。
