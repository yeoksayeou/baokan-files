Production Great Leap Forward - Technology is the Guarantee
Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory Successfully Trials "Hot Press Degumming Method," Output Increases Fourfold
Morning Light Machine Factory: Everyone Competes as Zhuge Liang, Efficiency Increases Tenfold, Hundredfold

(News Daily Report) The "Hot Press Degumming Method" created by the workers of the state-owned Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory has been successfully tested. The success of this method will cause a major technological innovation in China's silk industry.

Tests have proven that using the "Hot Press Degumming Method" can increase output fourfold with the same equipment, increase the cocoon-to-silk ratio by 20% with the same raw materials (waste cocoons), speed up refining time by threefold, improve product quality, increase fiber length by 10%, save three-quarters of steam consumption, and save 30% of labor.

For fifty years, silk industry refining workshops have used the "rotting method" to treat "waste cocoons," i.e., soaking waste cocoons in hot water tanks and boiling them (many factories still follow this method). In 1956, the factory's workers created a "quick refining method," which, although improved compared to the original, still involved boiling cocoons in hot water. Workers had high labor intensity when stirring, and product quality and output were low. The newly created "Hot Press Degumming Method" completely changes operating conditions, not only improving output and quality, but also preventing workers from being scalded by hot water as often as in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 21st. Young workers at the Nanjing State-owned Morning Light Machine Factory have launched a wave of technological innovation, increasing work efficiency tenfold and hundredfold.

During the anti-waste and anti-conservatism rectification and improvement campaign, the factory's Party committee called on all factory workers to drastically increase quotas, complete two months' worth of production tasks in one month, and ensure the completion of the trial production of the Changjiang brand car before May, and the trial production of a medium-sized tractor two months ahead of schedule. Inspired by this call, young workers quickly launched a competition of "everyone competing as Zhuge Liang, everyone comparing wisdom." Song Tingxiang, a young fitter in the punching and welding workshop, responded to the Party committee's call and worked hard for three days to trial-produce a mold that changed the "hydraulic jack" parts from manual operation to mechanical processing, increasing work efficiency by more than thirty times. Young workers in various workshops throughout the factory immediately launched a wave to catch up with Song Tingxiang. Some young workers collectively analyzed product process drawings, while others consulted materials to study the knack for solving key problems. Zhao Dechang and Zhou Changpeng, fitters in the punching and welding workshop, worked hard in their spare time to improve tools, increasing the production efficiency of a product part by one hundred and twenty times. Wang Shibo, a young fitter in the Changjiang brand car trial production group of the punching and welding workshop, successfully trial-produced two sets of molds on the evening of the 18th, changing nine parts from manual operation to mechanical processing, with an average increase in work efficiency of approximately six hundred times. Yu Zhilu and Ji Guoben, young workers in the forging workshop, forged a part on the day of the skill competition, improving operations, increasing furnace capacity, and increasing efficiency by seventeen times. Song Tingxiang also rushed to make a mold overnight to improve operations, and completed the mold manufacturing on the 19th, estimating that work efficiency could be increased by two hundred times. The group led by Song Tingxiang also guaranteed to convert all processed parts to mechanical processing this year. (Picture attached)

    生产大跃进  技术是保证
    上海绢纺厂试成“热压脱胶法”产量增加四倍
    晨光机器厂人人赛诸葛效率成十倍成百倍提高
    本报讯　据新闻日报报道：国营上海绢纺厂职工创造的“热压脱胶法”试验成功了。由于这一方法试验成功，在我国丝绸工业上将引起一次重大的技术革新。
    试验证明：采用“热压脱胶法”，用同样设备，产量能提高四倍，同样原料（下脚茧）出绵率能提高20％，精炼时间也快三倍，产品质量也提高了，纤维长度增长10％，蒸气量节约四分之三，人工节省30％。
    丝绸工业精炼车间处理“下脚茧”，五十年来一向是采用“腐化法”，即把下脚茧泡在热水桶里煮熟（目前有许多工厂还沿袭这种办法）。该厂职工在1956年曾创造了一种叫“快速炼法”，这种方法虽然比原来有所改进，但仍是用热水煮茧，工人在搅拌时，劳动强度高，产品质量和产量也低。这次创造的
  “热压脱胶法”，彻底改变操作条件，不仅提高产量和质量，操作的工人也不再像过去那样常会被热水烫伤了。
    据新华社南京21日电　南京市国营晨光机器厂青年职工掀起技术革新热潮，使工作效率成十倍成百倍地提高。
    在反浪费反保守的大整大改中，这个厂的党委向全厂职工提出了要猛突定额，一个月完成两个月生产任务，保证5月前完成长江牌汽车的试制工作，提前两个月试制成中型拖拉机的号召。受到这个号召鼓舞的青年工人们很快掀起了“人人赛诸葛，个个比智慧”的竞赛。冲焊车间青年钳工宋庭祥首先响应党委的号召，苦战三天，试制成一种模具，使“油压千斤顶”零件由手工操作改为机械加工，工作效率提高三十多倍。全厂各车间的青年职工立即掀起赶上宋庭祥的热潮。青年工人们有的集体分析产品工艺图纸，有的查阅资料，研究解决关键问题的窍门。冲焊车间钳工赵德昌和周昌鹏利用工余时间苦思穷想，改进工具，使一种产品零件生产效率提高一百二十倍。冲焊车间长江牌汽车试制组青年钳工王式波在18日晚上试制成功两副模具，使九种零件由手工操作改为机械加工，工作效率平均约可提高六百倍。锻压车间青年工人俞志禄和季国本在比武大会的当天锻制一种零件，改进了操作，增加炉量，提高效率十七倍。宋庭祥也连夜赶制一种模具，改进操作，19日已完成模具的制造，估计工作效率可以提高两百倍。宋庭祥所领导的小组还保证在今年内把所有的加工零件全部改为机械加工。（附图片）
