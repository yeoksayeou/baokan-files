Chen Yi Wants Literature and Art to Serve "Me"
Yu Ji

Chen Yi is a notorious "leftist." Usually, he tries his best to put on a "leftist" face to pressure and intimidate people; but in the face of great storms, his rightist essence, which has been hidden for many years, can no longer be concealed, and he reveals his true colors.

Although the rightist Chen Yi calls himself a "literary and artistic authority," he doesn't have any complete "theories" worth commenting on or refuting in literary and artistic matters. Only by displaying his actions in literary and artistic work, analyzing and criticizing them, can we see through the truth of his double-dealing activities and expose the essence of his bourgeois literary and artistic views.

(I)

Although Chen Yi superficially admits that literature and art are subordinate to politics and serve politics, and that literary and artistic work in the army is a part of political work, in reality, he has repeatedly emphasized the need to build the army's literary and artistic work into "a separate branch of the military." Moreover, even after he left his post, he still wrote articles publicly stating: "I think what I still regret is that we have not completely built literary and artistic work into a separate branch of the military in the army."

In Chen Yi's view, the words "separate branch" are by no means inappropriate; rather, he proposes it as a "guiding ideology," a "guiding principle," that is, "the question of what position to place literature and art in." This is a major issue of right and wrong that is worth studying.

The position of literary and artistic work in the entire revolutionary cause has long been determined and arranged. The entire revolutionary cause is like a large machine, and it is the "gears and screws" (Lenin's words). It should "obey the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party in a certain revolutionary period," it is "an indispensable part of the entire revolutionary cause," but "compared with other more important parts, there are naturally priorities and secondary importance" (Mao Zedong's words).

Taking literary and artistic work in the army as an example: it has always been an integral part of political work. From the Red Army era to the present, the army's leading organs have always regarded it as a powerful weapon for propaganda and education, giving full play to its characteristics and role, making it serve the troops, serve the masses, and serve the needs of war and army building. For thirty years, it has always implemented the Party's literary and artistic line, promoted the characteristics of "combativeness and mass character," and its achievements, role, and position have long been determined and arranged in the minds of the troops and the people.

However, Chen Yi has been clamoring that in the army, the position of literary and artistic work has not been properly arranged, "everything is of high rank, only culture is low," in other words, it has not been possible to make literary and artistic work into an independent special branch of the military according to his "ideal."

Judging from Chen Yi's specific actions, the actual significance of building this "branch" is to make the army's literary and artistic work a self-contained system, independent of the leadership and supervision of the political departments, to compete with the Party's entire literary and artistic cause, and to turn the cultural departments under his leadership into a legal "independent kingdom," and he himself would naturally become the "commander" of this "branch" and the "leader" of the "kingdom."

Although Chen Yi said that this ambition has not been fully realized, it has long been exposed in his actual actions.

First, Chen Yi's basic attitude towards superiors is: to resist, to fight. His attitude towards the General Political Department's instructions and decisions is precisely "to implement some that are agreeable, and to disobey or simply refuse those that are not." He only wants superiors to give people, money, and positions, but he lightly "conceals his faults" or even openly confronts superiors' criticisms and supervision. He tries his best to shirk, perfunctorily, quibble, and deny his mistakes; but he is complacent and meticulous about achievements. He seizes the fruits of labor achieved by the army's literary and artistic workers under the leadership of the Party as his own, and often uses a detailed account of "I" have several "firsts," several "champions," so many "works," and so many "performances" to resist the leadership's criticism and to serve as his "trump card" in dominating the literary and artistic circles. He emphasizes to the leaders of the General Political Department that "I" am "literature and art," and "literature and art" is "special"; he slanders the leadership for having a "mountain ravine style" and "not understanding the characteristics of literature and art." In Chen Yi's view, literary and artistic work should be led by him as the "highest leader" (beyond the leadership of the General Political Department), and his bourgeois literary and artistic views should be taken as the "guiding ideology of the army's literary and artistic work."

Second, Chen Yi emphasizes "literary and artistic specialness" in the army, but emphasizes that "I" am "the army" and "the army is special" in the literary and artistic circles. Although he verbally admits that the Party's literary and artistic cause is a unified whole, in reality, he opposes the "army" to the so-called "local." He uses the honor and prestige of the People's Liberation Army, his position in the army, and the army's literary and artistic manpower, material resources, and existing achievements to be arrogant, conceited, and unreasonable in the literary and artistic circles. He compares himself with the national literary and artistic departments and organizations, competes for superiority, and always sings a different tune and always wants to overwhelm others. He is complacent when he has advantages; and when he is slightly dissatisfied, he openly and secretly fights with others, raising himself and attacking others. He destroyed the inherent unity between military and civilian literary and artistic work. In his eyes: the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is also "local." "You" don't understand "the characteristics of the army," "you" should interfere less in "our" affairs. Then, in Chen Yi's mind, the "literary and artistic branch of the military" is meant to form a force that opposes and counteracts the Party's entire literary and artistic cause for "outside the military." It can also be said that this is the revival of Gao Gang's "military party theory" in Chen Yi's thinking.

The rightist Chen Yi is such a thoroughgoing careerist. When he leads literary and artistic work, he wants to build literature and art into "a separate branch of the military"; when he does not lead, he engages in splitting activities, gathers followers, and wants to ruin the army's literary and artistic work. Compared with Ding Ling's anti-Party activities and her "one-bookism," Chen Yi's anti-Party literary and artistic views, which are all for "me," can also be called: Chen Yi's "one-branchism." However, due to the constant struggle of the General Political Department against his ideological views, his ambition cannot succeed, so he has to "regret it."

(II)

Although Chen Yi verbally admits that facing the company, serving the soldiers, and comprehensively developing combativeness and mass character in literary and artistic work are the guidelines for the army's literary and artistic work, his actual practices are contrary to this guideline.

First, literary and artistic work in the army can only play its role when it truly faces the company, goes deep among the masses, and combines with the vast number of officers and soldiers. Therefore, the General Political Department clearly decided to focus on carrying out mass amateur activities as the focus of the army's literary and artistic work. However, Chen Yi one-sidedly emphasized that the use of "professional" literary and artistic workers should "be conducive to the development of literary and artistic work and the progress and improvement of the literary and artistic army" under any circumstances. In reality, this means only caring about "professional" and not caring about "amateur," only talking about "improvement" and not caring about "popularization," separating and opposing "professional" and "amateur," and "improvement" and "popularization," which inevitably leads to "professional" being divorced from the masses and "improvement" being divorced from reality. In specific work, Chen Yi also puts "professional" activities in the first place and is never interested in "popularization" work. He is indifferent to the fact that the company can't hear songs, but is only obsessed with large-scale, grand-style performances, competing for first place, and winning championships. In the final analysis, it is nothing more than showing off the power and "strength" of his "branch commander." We need "professional" activities and also need to improve; however, we oppose one-sided "professional" that is divorced from the masses, and we oppose the so-called "improvement" that is divorced from reality. We are even more resolutely opposed to individual careerists like Chen Yi who use "professional" and "improvement" as stepping stones.

Second, the Party often calls on our literary and artistic workers to go deep into life, go deep into struggle, improve their political awareness, strengthen ideological transformation, and wholeheartedly serve the people. However, Chen Yi openly spread bourgeois personal fame and profit views, emphasizing "personal future" and "personal plans," and advocating so-called "thirty and standing" and "becoming famous and establishing a family." He slandered the leaders of the troops for "always emphasizing serving the troops, but not considering the personal future of literary and artistic workers," which is "misleading the children" and "dogmatism." He emphasized that "the cultivation of famous writers and famous actors should be raised to the height of cultivating combat heroes." In cultivation, he one-sidedly emphasized improving skills and opposed ideological transformation. Saying that "we don't have more technical views, but we lack technical views," "only improvement can solve the ideological burden of literary and artistic workers." Saying that "only the number of performances can best reflect the achievements of the cultural troupe," and "the whole year is spent on rectifying ideology, and nothing has been accomplished." Saying that "the cultural troupe is a working team, not ordinary intellectuals who need to be transformed." Therefore, in the past political movements, Chen Yi was always a promoter of retreat and an opponent.

It is not difficult to see that Chen Yi is implementing a bourgeois literary and artistic line. He wants to use this line to oppose the Party's literary and artistic line and to tamper with the Party's literary and artistic direction in order to realize his personal ambitions. In reality, some of his views have adapted to or promoted the personal fame and profit thinking of some people, and have corrupted and poisoned many young literary and artistic workers. In addition, he is accustomed to using the means of "blowing," "flattering," "pulling," and "praising" to win people's hearts, so that some victims do not know there is poison, and victims do not think they are harmed, and even regard him as a "good superior" and "good friend," and some people (rightists) even call him "the sun." It was not until his true face as a rightist was revealed that they suddenly realized and woke up from their dreams. This is where the harmfulness and danger of Chen Yi, this careerist, lies.

(III)

Chen Yi also exposed his bourgeois literary and artistic views and the ugly face of a double-dealer in his many articles.

Chen Yi's articles can be roughly divided into three categories:

The first category is literary and artistic essays, which can be tentatively called "theoretical" articles.

To be honest, Chen Yi is neither "studious" nor "inquisitive" on some academic or policy-related literary and artistic issues, and he is very lacking in self-knowledge. But he just likes to write articles and show off on these issues. Relying only on a smattering of knowledge, or even ignorance, he dares to point fingers and talk glibly with his nose in the air, showing that he is an omniscient saint, a learned genius, and a literary authority. In reality, his articles of this kind are not only full of errors, but also absurd words below common sense are often seen. But in his articles of this kind, the most vivid impression given to us is: the separation of words and deeds, and the inconsistency between appearance and reality.

For example, in the discussion of "the national form of music and dance," he is a "leftist"; but not long after, he used a nihilistic eye to evaluate our brilliant national literary and artistic heritage as: "In our country for three thousand years, only one "Water Margin," one "Dream of the Red Chamber," and one "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" can be counted."

In many articles, he portrays himself as a "defender" of "socialist realism"; but during the "blooming and contending" period, he only emphasized that it is "not the only method," and did not publicize that it is "the best method." And he distortedly explained this method of creation as: like when he speaks, "it's okay to speak sitting or standing." We say that this is a creative method guided by the Marxist worldview, and the concept of the word "method" belongs to the category of thought; but Chen Yi explained it as a general technical method. His ignorance shows how false this "literary authority" is.

In "literary and artistic essays," Chen Yi resolutely advocated "there must be 'contending' with analysis and 'releasing' with distinction," "not blindly," and even used the "constitution" and "conscience" to subdue and reprimand people, it seems that he still "has a minimum of patriotism and a position of supporting socialism." But in the blink of an eye, he went to Tianjin, Jinzhou and other places to stir up trouble and spread poison. This person who "supports" the constitution has transformed himself into a vanguard of opposing the Party and socialism. He strongly opposed the people's democratic dictatorship, saying that the domestic class struggle has been extinguished, "dictatorship" is outdated, and "dictatorship" again is "dictatorship" against good people. He promoted bourgeois democracy, saying that "our country has not gone through capitalism, so it lacks the exercise of democratic life." He advocated the democracy of scolding in the parliaments of capitalist countries, and the hypocrisy of democracy. This "patriot" and "supporter of socialism" vilified the People's Liberation Army as: full of contradictions and pitch black; portrayed agricultural cooperativization as a tragic situation of "returning to the fields without fields to return to, and returning to the hometown to retire without a hometown to return to"; instigated the masses to attack the Party, to "change the dynasty of socialism," and attempted to restore capitalism. This is the real "article" that Chen Yi wants to write.

The second category can be called "advertising-style" self-boasting superficial articles. In this type of article, Chen Yi always puts the word "I" above the nine heavens. He can write "I" as the resourceful central figure of "exterminating traitors in Mulandian" (published in "Harvest" Issue 3); he can write "I" as the warrior of "Raid on Liu Heiqi" (published in "Red Flag Fluttering" Issue 6). In reality, the "I" in Chen Yi's writings is an "I" created by "artistic imagination"; it does not conform to the reality of "I." Just as he taught readers "how to see through the double-dealing activities of counter-revolutionary elements" in the book "It's Not Okay to Sleep with a Tiger," and the author himself is a "double-dealer." He is very hypocritical.

In Chen Yi's articles of this kind, we can also add an article he wrote under the pseudonym Dong Jin: "Comrade Hu Ke's Knot Can Be Untied" and an article he wrote under the pseudonym Zhang Zongxin: "To the Army Writers Who Spoke on the Literary Gazette." Here, Chen Yi felt that it was not enough to use the word "I" to elevate himself, and he was afraid that the readers were not clear enough, so he simply took out the two words "Chen Yi," bragging, praising, elevating himself, attacking the leadership, and attacking others. This kind of despicable and shameless act of "killing three birds with one stone" is really unheard of and unseen.

The third category is articles in which Chen Yi avenges his grievances, vents his personal anger, abuses his power for personal gain, and confuses the public. The two pseudonym articles mentioned above can also belong to this category. There are also articles such as "Rebutting the Rightists' Attack on the Army's Literary and Artistic Work." In these articles, Chen Yi regards all those who have criticized him as "thorns in his eyes," and attacks them indiscriminately, just like he slanders "someone has a problem," "someone is a rightist," and "some people are a small group" in his daily remarks, attempting to politically frame some good people. In addition, he has another purpose, which is to issue an announcement for himself: "Chen Yi is fighting the rightists." He wants to use this "smoke screen" to hide the fox tail of his true rightist again.

The above shows that Chen Yi's literary and artistic view is that "I" is above everything and everything serves "me." As for the Party's leadership and the direction of "serving the workers, peasants and soldiers," in Chen Yi's view, it is just a deceptive slogan. Therefore, in literature and art, the rightist Chen Yi is also a spokesman for the bourgeoisie. March 2, 1958

    陈沂要文艺为“我”服务
    虞棘
    陈沂是个出了名的“左”派，平时，他竭力摆出一副“左”的面孔压人、唬人；但在大风大浪里，他那隐蔽了多年的右的实质，却再也藏不住了，就来了个原形毕露。
    右派分子陈沂虽然自诩为“文艺权威”，但在文艺问题上，他却没什么成套的“理论”可评、可驳；只有把他在文艺工作中的所作所为，摆出来分析、批判，才能识破他的两面派活动的真相，才能揭穿他的资产阶级文艺观点的实质。
              （一）
    陈沂在表面上虽然也承认：文艺从属于政治，服务于政治，在军队中文艺工作是政治工作的一部分。但是，实际上，他却一再强调要把军队的文艺工作建设成“一个兵种”，而且在他离职以后，还念念不忘地写文章公开表示：“我认为至今还引以为憾的是：我们还没有把文艺工作在部队中完全建设成为一个兵种”。
    在陈沂说来，“兵种”二字，绝非措词不当；而是把它当做“领导思想”、“领导原则”亦即“把文艺摆在什么地位的问题”提出来的。这就是很值得研究的大是大非问题了。
    文艺工作在整个革命事业中的地位，本来是早就确定了和摆好了的。整个革命事业好比一架大机器，它就是“齿轮和螺丝钉”（列宁语）。它应当“服从党在一定革命时期所规定的革命任务”，它是“整个革命事业不可缺少的一部分”，但“和别的更重要的部分比较起来，自然有轻重缓急第一第二之分”（毛主席语）。
    以军队中的文艺工作来讲：它自来是政治工作的一个组成部分。从红军时代直到现在，军队领导机关一直把它当做宣传教育工作的有力武器，发挥了它的特性和作用，使它服务于部队，服务于群众，服务于战争和建军的需要。三十年来，它始终执行着党的文艺路线，发扬了“战斗性、群众性”的特色，它的成绩、作用和地位，在部队和人民心目中也是早就确定了的、摆好了的。
    然而，陈沂却一直叫嚣着：在军队中，文艺工作的地位没摆好，没摆对，“万般皆上品、唯有文化低”，换句话说，就是没能按照他的“理想”把文艺工作搞成军队中的一个独立的特殊兵种。
    从陈沂的具体行动来看，建设这个“兵种”的实际意义，就是要军队的文艺工作自成系统，自立门户，不受政治部门的领导和监督，要和党的整个文艺事业分庭抗礼，要把他领导的文化部门搞成一个合法的“独立王国”，他自己当然也就成了这个“兵种”的“司令”、“王国”的“首领”了。
    陈沂的这种野心，虽然他说还没能完全实现，但在他的实际行动中却早已暴露出来。
    第一、陈沂对上级的基本态度叫做：要抗、要争。他对于总政治部的指示和决定，正是“合意的就执行一些，不合意的就阳奉阴违或根本拒绝”；他只要上级给人、给钱、给地位，而对于上级的批评和监督，却轻则“文过饰非”，重则公开对抗。他犯了错误尽量推脱、搪塞、狡辩、抵赖；但对成绩却津津乐道而又锱铢必较；他把全军文艺工作者在党的领导下所获得的劳动成果攫为己有，经常拿着：“我”有几个“第一”、几个“冠军”、多少部“作品”和多少场“演出”的流水账来抗拒领导的批评，来做为他在文艺界称王称霸的“王牌”。他在总政领导面前强调“我”就是“文艺”、“文艺”就是“特殊”；污蔑领导上“山沟作风”、“不懂文艺特性”。在陈沂看来，文艺工作就应当以他为“最高领导”（超越总政治部的领导），就应当以他的资产阶级文艺观点作为“全军文艺工作的指导思想”。
    第二、陈沂在军队中强调“文艺特殊”，但在文艺界中却又强调“我”是“军队”，“军队特殊”。他在口头上虽然也承认党的文艺事业是一个统一的整体，但是，实际上，他却把“军队”和所谓“地方”对立起来。他利用解放军的荣誉和威信，利用他在军队中的职位，利用军队文艺工作的人力、物力和既有的成绩，在文艺界中骄横自负，蛮不讲理。他同国家文艺部门、文艺团体比上下、争高低，处处唱对台戏而又处处要压人一头。有了好处就沾沾自喜；稍不如意就同人家明争暗斗，抬高自己，打击别人。他破坏了军内外文艺工作之间固有的团结。在他的眼里：党中央宣传部也是“地方上的”。“你们”不懂“军队的特点”，“你们”少管“我们”的事。那末，陈沂心目中的“文艺兵种”，对“军外”来说，就是要形成这样一股同党的整个文艺事业相对立、相抗衡的实力。也可以说，这是高岗的“军党论”在陈沂的思想上的复活。
    右派分子陈沂就是这样一个彻头彻尾的野心家。他领导文艺工作的时候就要把文艺建成“一个兵种”；不领导的时候就搞分裂活动，纠群结伴，想把军队的文艺工作搞垮。这同丁玲的反党活动和她的“一本书主义”比较起来：陈沂的这种一切为“我”的反党的文艺观点，我们也可以把它叫做：陈沂的“一个兵种主义”。但是，由于总政领导同他这种思想观点不断地进行斗争，他的野心不可能得逞，所以他只好“引以为憾”了。
                （二）
    陈沂在口头上虽然也承认：面向连队、为兵服务、全面发展战斗性群众性的文艺工作，是军队文艺工作的方针。但是，他的实际做法却和这个方针背道而驰。
    第一、军队中的文艺工作，只有当它真正做到面向连队、深入群众、同广大官兵相结合的时候，才能发挥它的作用。所以，总政治部明确地决定：以开展群众性的业余活动为部队文艺工作的重点。然而，陈沂却片面地强调：对于“专业”文艺工作者的使用，在任何情况下都要“有利于、有助于文艺工作的发展、文艺军队的进步与提高”。这实际上，就是光顾“专业”不顾“业余”，光讲“提高”不管“普及”，把“专业”和“业余”、“提高”和“普及”割裂开来，对立起来，其结果必然使“专业”脱离了群众，“提高”脱离了实际。在具体工作中，陈沂也是把“专业”活动放在第一位，对于“普及”工作从来不感兴趣的。连队听不到歌声他无动于衷，而只是醉心于大场面、大气派，争第一，夺冠军。归结起来，也无非是为了显示他这“兵种司令”的威风和“实力”而已。我们需要“专业”的活动也需要提高；但是，我们反对脱离群众的片面的“专业”，反对脱离实际的所谓“提高”。我们更坚决反对像陈沂这样把“专业”和“提高”当做垫脚石的个人野心家。
    第二、党经常号召我们文艺工作者深入生活、深入斗争，提高政治觉悟，加强思想改造，全心全意的为人民服务。然而，陈沂却公开散播资产阶级个人名利观点，强调“个人前途”、“个人打算”，提倡所谓“三十而立”“成名成家”。他污蔑部队领导上“总是强调为部队服务，却不考虑文艺工作者的个人前途”，就是“误人子弟”，就是“教条主义”。他强调“要把培养名作家、名演员提高到培养战斗英雄的高度”。在培养上却又片面地强调提高技术，反对思想改造。说什么“我们不是多了个技术观点，而是缺少个技术观点”，“只有提高才能解决文艺工作者的思想包袱”。说什么“只有演出场次才最能体现文工团的成绩”，而“一年到头整思想，整来整去，一点成绩也没干出来”。说什么“文工团是工作队伍，不是一般要改造的知识分子”。所以，在历次政治运动中，陈沂总是个促退派，反对派。
    不难看出：陈沂实行的是资产阶级的文艺路线。他想用这条路线来同党的文艺路线相对抗，来篡改党的文艺方向，以实现他的个人野心。实际上，他的一些观点，已经适应了或者助长了一部分人的个人名利思想，已经腐蚀了和毒害了许多文艺青年。加上他又惯用“吹”“拍”“拉”“捧”的手段笼络人心，使得一些受毒者不知有毒，受害者不以为害，甚至把他当做“好上级”、“好朋友”，还竟然有人（右派分子）把他称做“太阳”。直到他的右派面目真相大白时，才恍然大悟，如梦方醒。陈沂这个野心家的危害性就在这里，危险性也就在这里。
              （三）
    陈沂在他写的许多文章里，也暴露了他的资产阶级文艺观点和两面派的丑恶嘴脸。
    陈沂的文章，大体可分为三类：
    第一类，是文艺杂谈式的，姑且把它叫做“理论性”的文章。
    老实讲，在一些学术性或政策性的文艺问题上，陈沂是既非“好学”又不“多问”，而且十分缺乏自知之明的。但在这些问题上，他却偏偏好写写文章、出出风头。仅凭一知半解，甚至不知不解，就敢指手划脚、目空一切地高谈阔论，借以显示自己是全知的圣人、博学的才子、文坛的权威。实际上，他的这一类的文章，不仅错误百出，而且常识以下的荒唐文词也屡见不鲜。但在他的这一类文章里，给我们的最鲜明的印象是：言行分裂、表里不一。
    比如：在“音乐舞蹈的民族形式”的讨论中，他是“左”派；但是，为时不久，他对我们光辉灿烂的民族文学艺术遗产却用虚无主义的眼光估价为：“我们国家三千年，数的出来的也不过是一部‘水浒传’、一部‘红楼梦’、一部‘三国志’”而已。
    他在许多文章里，把自己描绘成“社会主义现实主义”的“卫道者”；但在“鸣”“放”期间，他却只强调它“不是唯一的方法”，而不宣传它“是最好的方法”。并且把这种创作方法，歪曲地解释为：像他讲话时“坐着讲也行、站着讲也行”。我们说这是一种由马克思主义的世界观来指导的创作方法，“方法”二字的概念属于思想的范畴；而陈沂却把它解释为一般技术性的方法。他如此无知，也可以看出这位“文艺权威”是如何虚假了。
    在“文艺杂谈”里，陈沂坚决地主张“要有分析的‘争’、有区别的‘放’，”“不能盲目”，甚至拿“宪法”和“良心”来压服人、训斥人，看起来，好像他还“有一个起码的爱国主义的、拥护社会主义的立场”。但是，转瞬间，他却到天津、锦州等处呼风唤雨、纵火放毒。这个“拥护”宪法的人，摇身一变，成了反党反社会主义的急先锋。他极力反对人民民主专政，说：国内阶级斗争业已熄灭，“专政”业已过时，再“专政”就是对善良的百姓“专政”。他宣扬资产阶级民主，说“我们国家没有经过资本主义，所以缺少民主生活的锻炼”。他提倡资本主义国家议会的叫骂的民主、虚伪的民主。这个“爱国主义”者、“拥护社会主义”的人，却把解放军污蔑成：矛盾百出、漆黑一团；把农业合作化描绘成“解甲归田无田可归，告老还乡、无乡可还”的悲惨境界；煽动群众向党进攻，要“社会主义改朝换代”，企图使资本主义复辟。这才是陈沂的真正要做的“文章”。
    第二类，可叫做“广告式”的自我吹嘘的表面文章。在这一类的文章里，陈沂总是把“我”字捧到九天之上。他可以把“我”写成“木栾店锄奸”（载“收获”第三期）的足智多谋的中心人物；可以把“我”写成“奔袭刘黑七”（载“红旗飘飘”第六期）的勇士。实际上，陈沂笔下的“我”，乃是凭“艺术想像力”创造的“我”；并不符合“我”的实际。正如他在“同老虎一起睡觉是不行的”一书中，教训读者“应当怎样识破反革命分子的两面派活动”而作者自己就是个“两面派”一样。他是十分虚伪的。
    在陈沂的这一类的文章里，还可以加上他化名冬今写的一篇：“胡可同志的疙瘩可以解开了”和化名章宗新写的一篇：“致在文艺报上发言的部队作家”。在这里，陈沂感到用“我”字来高抬自己还不够味儿，还怕读者不够明确，就干脆把“陈沂”二字拿出来，大吹特吹、大捧特捧、抬高自己、攻讦领导、打击别人。这种“一箭三雕”的卑鄙下流的行径，真是闻所未闻、见所未见的。
    第三类，是陈沂挟嫌报复、发泄私愤、假公济私、混淆视听的文章。前面说过的那两篇化名文章，也可以属于这一类。还有如“回击右派对部队文艺工作的进攻”等文。在这些文章里，陈沂对于凡是批评过他的人，都看做是“眼中钉”，不分青红皂白、一律打击，像他在日常言论中污蔑“某人有问题”、“某人是右派”、“某些人是小集团”一样，企图从政治上陷害一些好人。另外，他还有一个目的，就是为自己发布公告：“陈沂正在反右派”。想用这种“障眼法”，把他这个真正右派的狐狸尾巴，再一次掩藏起来。
    上述种种，可以看出：陈沂的文艺观点就是“我”高于一切、一切为“我”服务。至于党的领导、“为工农兵服务”的方向，在陈沂说来，不过是一句骗人的口头禅而已。所以说，在文艺上，右派分子陈沂也是个资产阶级的代言人。　1958年3月2日
