    脱胎换骨，步步向左，贡献所长，加快成为自食其力的劳动者
    新华社上海3日电　上海市工商界1日上午举行了有一万五千人参加的誓师大会，提出全市工商业者要在五年、争取三年内改造成为自食其力的劳动者，并向全国各地工商界挑战，展开友谊竞赛。
    大会提出上海工商业者今年一定要做到下列五个方面：积极参加整风运动，改造自己的政治立场；自觉地参加体力劳动；积极投入当前生产大跃进的热潮，贡献自己的技术专长和业务经验；生活上培养勤俭节约习惯，立即放弃或者订出规划逐步放弃不合理的待遇；参加集中整风学习的工商业者人人订好个人整改规划，小型工商业者按行业或小组订立整改公约，定期检查开展评比竞赛。
    许多工商业者踊跃地在大会上发言，表示要用行动来贯彻这个誓言。公私合营安达棉纺织厂总经理刘靖基和公私合营大中华火柴公司总经理刘念义先后热烈地提出了加速自我改造的计划，表示决心要争取尽早地把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。他们还要抽出一定时间下乡下厂参加体力劳动。公私合营新业制酸厂私方厂长孙师白，表示要拿出干劲，同职工一道在今年提前一个季度建成一个年产五万吨硫酸的新厂。普陀区工商业者提出保证：要在今年5月底前结束全区工商业者的整风学习，在企业中认真执行个人整改规划；立即投入当前的反浪费反保守运动；合理安排生活，勤俭持家，保证今年认购公债超过去年20％。
    中共上海市委书记曹荻秋到会上讲了话。他勉励工商业者在大跃进中找出一切阻碍自己跃进的东西，下决心确实改变政治立场，改造思想。他说，目前许多工商业者要求参加劳动锻炼，就是改变立场与思想的方法之一。曹荻秋希望每个工商业者制订跃进规划，提出加速自我改造的奋斗目标、步骤和方法，随时检查，争取在同各地工商业者的竞赛中领先。
    在这次大会以前，各区工商业者由于受到当前工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞，纷纷集会，要求加速自我改造。中国民主建国会上海市委员会在2月27日召开全体成员大会，号召工商界中的民建成员在工作上做到职责相称，在劳动中刻苦锻炼，在生活上反掉一切特殊化，尽速把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    新华社天津3日电　天津市工商界1日提出倡议，向北京、上海和其他各地工商业者进行友谊竞赛。
    民主建国会天津市委常务委员会和天津市工商业联合会常务委员会，1日联合召开扩大会议，在全市三万多名工商业者都订出了个人改造规划的基础上，提出了这个倡议。
    工商界的倡议书提出：（一）痛下决心，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场。在整风运动中撕开面子，放下架子，敞开思想，勇于深刻检查自己，虚心听取别人的批评和意见，彻底进行脱胎换骨的本质改造，做到人人前进，步步向左。
      （二）积极投入反浪费反保守运动，克服一切浪费和保守现象，并主动引火烧身，烧掉政治态度上和工作态度上的一切错误，坚决检查和批判对改造的抵触情绪和错误思想以及工作上不负责任的消极态度，拿出比过去搞私营企业更大的劲头，和职工一道向前跃进。
      （三）在企业生产和工作实践中，真心诚意地接受党和公方代表的领导，和党一条心，认真地学习和贯彻党的各项政策措施；老老实实地接受工人的监督，虚心学习工人阶级的大公无私、热爱劳动和勤俭朴素的高贵品质；认真学习社会主义经营管理方法，毫无保留地发挥技术才能和业务专长，贡献出自己一切力量。
      （四）努力学习政治理论和时事政策，提高社会主义觉悟，人人订立个人改造规划，一年进行一次整风，一季进行一次检查，开好生活会，互相评比，互相竞赛，开展批评与自我批评，共同提高，共同进步。
      （五）积极参加体力劳动，做到和职工共同劳动，在劳动实践中努力改造自己，坚决克服特殊化思想，以勤俭节约的精神安排好自己的生活，逐步向劳动人民生活水平看齐，尽快的把自己改变成为名副其实的劳动者。
    倡议书最后还提出：要与各地工商业者比谁政治立场改造得快、改造得好；比谁对祖国的生产建设贡献大；比谁学习得好；比谁能最积极、最主动地和职工共同劳动；比谁生活勤俭朴素。
    据新华社天津2日电　天津市近三万多名工商业者已制订出在思想改造和本身工作上跃进的个人规划，和保证实现他们提出的听毛主席的话、跟共产党走社会主义道路的誓言的行动纲领。
    许多人在个人规划中，把积极参加整风运动，彻底改变资本主义立场，争取早日改造成为自食其力的劳动者，放在首要地位。天津市工商业联合会副秘书长杨振华在个人规划中提出，在工商界大辩论中，要把资本主义的根挖出来，同时每周在业余时间抽出十小时学习政治经济学和有关工商界改造的文件，联系思想进行检查，争取每两周参加一次体力劳动，通过劳动彻底改造自己。公私合营第一茶叶总店副经理、青年工商业者戚少三的个人规划提出，积极参加整风运动，在思想上来个大跃进，下决心争取在两年内把自己改造成为一个自食其力的劳动者。
    很多在生产技术、经营管理方面具有专长的工商业者，除订立思想改造规划以外，还订出个人工作跃进规划，积极投入生产大跃进运动。公私合营仁立毛呢纺织厂的私方副厂长兼总工程师杨玉文，在个人规划中提出：保证全心全意为社会主义生产建设服务，同全厂工人和技术人员一起，努力提高毛织品的产品质量，在1958年内使烤花大衣呢的质量赶上日本的毛哔叽，使用寿命赶上英国的毛毯。他还要在今年内研究试制成功一种新产品。他在订出个人规划以后，已经改变过去只坐办公室的作风，每天都抽时间到车间、小组去同工人一起研究解决产品质量问题，并向老工人学习生产技术上的经验。
