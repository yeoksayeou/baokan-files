    Taking Steps to the Left, Advancing Step by Step
    Educational Union Supports Education and Science Workers' Initiative to Become "Red" and Expert

    (Our dispatch) The National Committee of the Chinese Education Union held its 7th enlarged presidium meeting of the Second Session on the afternoon of the 7th.
    The meeting held that the Education Union should resolutely and boldly support the socialist competition initiative of education and scientific workers for a great leap forward in self-ideological transformation, and launch a socialist competition climax where intellectuals are determined to become leftists, working hard for three to five years to become both "red" and expert, and even more "red" and expert, working-class intellectuals.
    The meeting pointed out: Since the seventeen scientific workers from the natural science research units in Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed to be determined to be leftists and strive to become "red" and expert, and even more "red" and expert, scientific workers within five years, it has been rapidly responded to in the ranks of scientific and educational workers. At present, the situation in which education and scientific workers consciously demand ideological transformation is developing rapidly. A mass, magnificent ideological transformation in the ranks of education and scientific workers, striving to achieve a socialist competition climax of becoming both "red" and expert, and even more "red" and expert, has begun to arrive.
    The meeting expressed its support for the slogan proposed by the seventeen scientists in Shanghai: "Everyone strives, plans their own, helps each other in normal times, compares at the end of the year, takes steps to the left, and strives to be thoroughly 'red'". We must also "delve into business, boldly innovate, step forward, and strive for expertise". The meeting held that, facing this new situation, the Education Union should, under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, plan and organize education and scientific workers to launch a nationwide socialist competition movement climax.

    万众一心各个战线齐跃进
    步步向左　步步前进
    红透专深教育工会支持教育、科学工作者倡议
    本报讯　中国教育工会全国委员会7日下午召开第二届第七次主席团扩大会议。
    会议认为，教育工会要坚决地、大胆地支持教育、科学工作者自我思想改造大跃进的社会主义竞赛倡议，掀起一个知识分子决心做左派、苦战三年到五年，成为又红又专、更红更专的工人阶级知识分子的社会主义竞赛高潮。
    会议指出：自从中国科学院上海的自然科学研究单位的十七位科学工作者提出下决心做左派，争取在五年内成为又红又专、更红更专的科学工作者的倡议以后，在科学和教育工作者的队伍中得到迅速响应。目前，教育、科学工作者自觉地要求思想改造的形势正在迅速地发展。在教育、科学工作者队伍中，一个群众性的波澜壮阔的思想改造，争取早日达到又红又专、更红更专的社会主义竞赛高潮已经开始到来。
    会议表示支持上海十七位科学家提出的倡议口号，“人人争取、各自规划、平时互助、年终评比、步步向左、力求红透”。还要“钻研业务、大胆革新、步步前进、力求专精”。会议认为：教育工会面对着这个新的形势，应该在各级党委统一领导下，有计划地推动和组织教育、科学工作者掀起一个全国规模的社会主义竞赛运动的高潮。
