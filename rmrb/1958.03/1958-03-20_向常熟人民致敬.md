Saluting the People of Changshu

(Continued from yesterday)

Striving for First Place in the New Year

A habit cultivated over a long period by millions of people is a force, and the most difficult to break. But once the masses have socialist consciousness, are organized, and cultivate a sense of conscious discipline, even thousand-year-old habits are easily broken.

"Visiting with trees planted, fighting at night like dragon lanterns, carrying thousands of loads through the Spring Festival, striving for first place in the New Year." This is the new content of the Changshu people's celebration of this year's Spring Festival, with the new year completing new tasks, and a new atmosphere of a great leap forward in production everywhere. Everyone competes in labor, every household emphasizes thrift. The new atmosphere sweeps away the old conventions and bad habits of thousands of years. People call this year's Spring Festival: "Leap Forward Year, Diligent Labor Year, Thrift Year, Break with Convention Year." This is indeed an unprecedented New Year.

On the first day of the lunar new year, Xingfeng Cooperative in Nanfeng Township had 100% of its able-bodied labor force working. Some cooperative members, in order to strive for first place, didn't even eat breakfast and went to the fields to carry mud in the thick fog. That day, they completed 510 cubic meters of earthwork, 76,000 loads of fertilizer, and also earthed up and opened ditches on 420 mu. Tangqiao Township proposed: "Five workdays per person to celebrate the New Year, a hundred loads of fertilizer to celebrate the Spring Festival."

A total of 272,761 people worked on the first and second days of the new year throughout the county. This is a record unprecedented in thousands of years. The masses say it well: "In the old society, hard work was for the landlord, in the new society, hard work is for ourselves. For the great leap forward in production, even thousand-year-old habits cannot stop us from advancing."

Red Flag Competition

Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, put in effort and sweat, and strive for first place. This is the belief of the heroic people of Changshu. They describe their enthusiasm as "the river of carts like a green dragon playing in the water, carrying mud like a fierce tiger descending the mountain."

Under the solemn call of the Changshu County Committee of the Communist Party of China, each district, each township, and each cooperative has formulated its own plan, and constantly struggles with conservative ideas, repeatedly revising the plan. Once the plan is set and the goal is clear, they muster their energy, ride the long wind and break through the myriad waves, bravely advance, and launch a socialist competition. There was also evaluation and competition in previous years, once a year, but in reality, there was a lack of supervision. The competition was completed in one year, and the award was given in the second year, which was very slow and could not promote production. The current evaluation and competition are very different from the past. The evaluation and awards are given at the time. The prizes are awarded by the county magistrate and the secretary of the county party committee, and some are even sent to the fields with gongs and drums, which the masses like very much.

Usually, every five or seven days, the entire cooperative and township conduct an evaluation. The one that is rated first wins a red flag with the words: "Taking the lead, maintaining honor"; the general one is a green flag with the words "Quickly spur on the horse," hoping to catch up with the red flag; the backward one is called a lagging cooperative, and is given a black flag with eight characters: "Muster energy, catch up quickly." Each cooperative has these three flags, and they take whatever flag they get down to the fields.

On the 40-50 kilometer journey, all we saw were red flags, very few green flags, and only one black flag. Those who get the black flag are certainly very uncomfortable. If the cooperative gets the black flag, the cooperative cadres immediately hold a meeting, first conduct self-criticism, and the cooperative members also muster their energy to catch up with the advanced and win the red flag. Like the black flag we saw on the way to Nanfeng, the masses were particularly motivated. When we returned from Nanfeng, the twilight had risen, a vast expanse, almost invisible, but in the land with the black flag, people were still working hard.

After the second evaluation, black flag cooperatives often leap forward to red flag cooperatives. There are advanced among the advanced, and there is no end to the advanced. If there are no evaluation indicators, compared with the most advanced, there are always relatively backward ones, and the backward ones get the black flag, not to mention the masses, even the cadres are sad. This may have a side effect on the psychology of the masses. Therefore, whether it is necessary to adopt this method of strong contrast and stimulation by inserting blue flags and black flags, we exchanged opinions with some comrades in charge of practical work, and the opinions were not completely consistent. This issue is worth further study. The County Party Committee and the Suzhou Prefectural Committee have already paid attention to this issue. First of all, they stipulated evaluation indicators, and the evaluation indicator numbers are calculated on a per-evaluation basis, without accumulating the numbers completed in the past, so that each cooperative can get a red flag, and lagging cooperatives can easily become advanced cooperatives.

One wave pushes another, leap forward and leap forward again, the entire land of Changshu has changed its face: small rivers are turned over, large rivers are opened, carrying mud is like weaving, and river mud is piled up into mountains.

As of March 1, the county has completed 29.14 million cubic meters of water conservancy, accounting for 61.8% of the annual task; accumulated 754.37 million loads of fertilizer, accounting for 56.3% of the annual task; afforested 1,228 mu, and planted 12.48 million trees, an average of 49 trees per household.

Based on the current speed of leap forward, it will soon break through the plan again.

"Knowing the Whole Year Early"

With the plans of the county, township, and cooperative, mutual evaluation and competition, how to make the movement last on a reliable basis is a big issue. The first is the labor issue. The intensity of a person's labor has a certain limit. It is impossible to stay up for several days and nights as a regular occurrence. On the one hand, we must try our best to give full play to the enthusiasm for labor, and on the other hand, we must consider the improvement of agricultural tools in a timely manner. By combining these, we can further tap the potential of labor, improve work efficiency, and maintain it regularly. Baimao Township created a cattle-drawn earthing and wheat beating machine during the movement, which can increase work efficiency by ten times; it also created a locally-made crane, which can complete ten cubic meters of earthwork per person per day, and a soil transport machine, which can complete twelve cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. In the future, there will be no need for people to carry soil when digging ponds. This creation is the result of discussions and research by township and cooperative cadres, blacksmiths, and carpenters.

In addition to the existing plans of the county, township, and cooperative, there must also be personal plans. In order to ensure the complete realization of the plan for the great leap forward in production, Heping Second Cooperative in Baimao Township formulated "Knowing the Whole Year Early," which is actually a personal plan. The specific methods are:

1. "Knowing the Whole Year Early" chart: Based on the situation and plan of the great leap forward in production, formulate a production plan, and do a good job in the three guarantees of size and maturity, one guarantee of production (900 jin per mu), two guarantees of work (the total work points of the whole cooperative increased by 14% compared to last year), and three guarantees of capital (indicators increased compared to last year). The three guarantee indicators stipulate the cooperative's income and expenditure plan, calculating each household's labor day at one yuan and four cents, and the average net income per member increased by 46% compared to last year. The members self-report and evaluate the labor days, and each household formulates an annual income and expenditure plan.

2. "Basic Labor Day System," which is the labor plan. Based on the three guarantees of work and the labor situation of the whole cooperative, determine the attendance and work points of various labor forces, establish standards, members self-report the number of work points invested, and the evaluation is finalized. There are annual labor plans and seasonal labor plans, and evaluations are made on a quarterly basis, and awards are given at the end of the year.

3. "Advance payment based on remaining labor days." According to the actual work done by members each quarter, after deducting food rations and labor days, advance payments are made based on the remaining labor days. More remaining work points, more advance payments; less remaining, less advance payments.

These three items are the three treasures of planning management.

Every household holds a family meeting, and everyone self-reports the number of attendance and work points to be invested. The leaders review, evaluate, and finalize the plan, and then each family hangs up the "Knowing the Whole Year Early" chart. As the old saying goes, "Wearing clothes won't make you poor, eating won't make you poor, but without a plan, you'll be poor for life." The peasants agree with "Knowing the Whole Year Early": "Knowing what's in your mind gives you strength to work."

Putting the national great leap forward production plan on the basis of the broad masses has obtained the most reliable guarantee. When personal interests are consistent with collective interests, the labor enthusiasm of the masses will always remain full.

"Of the thousands of measures to increase production, the leadership of cadres is the most important."

This is a saying circulating among the people of Changshu, which means: The key lies in leadership.

The characteristics of the Changshu production movement are: rapid development, strong momentum, sufficient energy, daring to think and do, thinking and doing, saying and doing, and constantly breaking through plans. The broad masses put forward vivid and heroic slogans: "Don't be afraid of not being able to do it, just be afraid of not being able to think of it. As long as you can think of it, you will definitely be able to achieve it"; and "What the predecessors did not dare to think of, we dare to think of; what the predecessors did not dare to do, we dare to do." The masses demanded: "Work hard and then work harder, wave after wave." Such a hero with unprecedented ambition and the power to overwhelm mountains and seas, with an iron will, what can't be accomplished?

How does the Changshu County Committee of the Communist Party of China lead the heroes of the county to leap forward? The Party Committee leads and the whole Party mobilizes. It is clear that agricultural production is the center of all work. The secretary takes the lead and personally grasps agricultural production. The county is divided into five major areas, with division of labor and responsibility to the end. It is necessary to have base points in every area, typical examples in every township, and role models in every cooperative, from point to area, so that the plan can be fully implemented to the end. Leading cadres learn technology and strive to be both red and expert. It is difficult to lead production well if you don't understand production. Cadres at the county, township, cooperative, and team levels should each engage in experimental fields. There are 35,000 mu of experimental fields in the county. Comrade Chen Jinmei took us to Nanfeng Township to see his experimental field. The experimental field is jointly managed by three groups of people: leading cadres, technical cadres, and experienced old farmers. Wooden signs are inserted in the field, with indicators written on them for easy inspection. This can not only achieve both red and expert, but also strengthen specific leadership over production, master advanced experience, vigorously implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and constantly promote the great leap forward in production, the movement deepens step by step, and victory follows victory, from beginning to end.

Solve ideological problems through great contention, great blooming, and great debate to correct the political direction. If the political direction is not correct, the production movement has no root. The second is through "thinking, comparing, finding, and calculating." Conduct five recollections and five comparisons: recollect the situation of the small-scale peasant economy in the past, and compare the superiority of cooperation; recollect the momentum of winter and spring production after the high-level collectivization in 1955, and compare the current determination to produce; recollect the fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army, and compare their own production momentum; recollect their attitude towards difficulties, and compare the production determination of Macheng County. Carry out three findings: find the experience and lessons of production in 1957, find the potential for increasing production in 1958, and find measures to implement the three major tasks of winter and spring. Launch four calculations: calculate the relationship between hard work, practical work, and the great leap forward, calculate the relationship between accumulating fertilizer, water conservancy, afforestation, and agricultural production increase, calculate the relationship between the great leap forward in production and increasing income, improving living standards, and supporting industrialization, and calculate the relationship between first suffering and then enjoying a prosperous future for realizing socialism. Through such "thinking, comparing, finding, and calculating," the right-leaning conservative ideology was broken, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses was boosted.

In all movements, there will always be different types of advanced, intermediate, and backward, especially under the rapid development of the production movement, the different situations of advanced and backward appear faster and change quickly. What is advanced today may be backward tomorrow; what is backward today may be advanced tomorrow. It is necessary to constantly accept good experiences and bad lessons. The leadership should grasp both ends and lead the middle. This is a dialectical method. Comrade Chen Jinmei said: Wherever it is advanced, hold meetings there and spread the experience. Outwardly broad and inwardly strict is actually urging the advanced not to be proud and complacent; wherever it is backward, go there to check and accept lessons. Outwardly strict and inwardly broad is actually helping him to work and enabling the backward to catch up with the advanced.

Socialist competition and evaluation are competitions and evaluations of the entire people's work in all aspects. Through evaluation and competition, the political direction will be corrected, conservative ideas will be overcome, and the ideological, production, and work will be promoted in an all-round way. Advanced indicators will be formulated and revolutionary enthusiasm will be boosted. The advanced lead the backward, and the backward catch up with the advanced, which in turn can promote the advanced to be more advanced. The advanced should be praised and the backward should be helped. In addition to publishing in newspapers, visits, and awards, Changshu also adopted the method of sending couplets. The couplet sent to the advanced cooperative is: "Leap forward again and again, full of enthusiasm to welcome the spring, victory after victory, first place in the new year." The couplet sent to the general cooperative is: "Strive for progress and catch up with the advanced, strive for the upstream and prevent falling behind." There are also methods of "leaving messages." The message to the advanced cooperative is: "Heroes stand tall, eyes look to the earth, starting from scratch, raising eyebrows and exhaling." The message left to the backward cooperative is: "Generally good, but many problems. The reason is that there is too little enthusiasm." Under the encouragement of the socialist competition, the backward quickly caught up with the advanced in a short period of time.

This great leap forward in production in Changshu is a wave after wave. The plans of leaders at all levels have been broken through again and again. As the "Instructions on Launching the Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservative Movement" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on March 3 said: "In the course of the movement, amazing miracles will constantly appear, various advanced speeds and advanced indicators that are difficult to achieve on weekdays will appear, and various advanced typical examples and flags will be established. The balance originally conceived and arranged will also be constantly broken through by the mass movement of ten thousand horses galloping." Chairman Mao said: "Imbalance is a universal and objective law. From imbalance to balance, and then from balance to imbalance, the cycle continues endlessly, but each cycle advances to a higher level." Therefore, the responsibility of the leadership is to take the advanced as an example, and constantly and timely put forward new goals and new tasks, "from imbalance to balance, and then from balance to imbalance, the cycle continues endlessly," so that the movement will always move forward!

The peasants of Changshu have written an epic of heroes in building socialism. We warmly salute them. (End)

    向常熟人民致敬
    周扬　周而复
    （续昨）
    争取新春第一名
    千百万人长期养成的习惯是一种力量，最不容易打破的。但一旦群众有了社会主义的觉悟，组织起来了，养成了自觉的纪律性，千年的老习惯也是很容易打破的。
    “植树带拜年，夜战当龙灯，千挑万担过春节，争取新春第一名”。这是常熟全县人民欢渡今年新春的新内容，新年完成新任务，到处洋溢着生产大跃进的新气象。人人比劳动、户户讲俭朴。新气象把千年来的陈规陋习，一扫而空。人们称今年的新春是：“跃进年，勤劳年，节约年，打破常规年”。这确确实实是破天荒的新年。
    南丰乡兴丰社在旧历正月初一那天，出勤人数占整半劳动力百分之一百，有的社员为了争取第一名，连早饭也没有吃，就冒着白茫茫的大雾下地挑泥了。这一天，他们完成五百十方土，七万六千担肥，并且还壅土开沟四百二十亩。塘桥乡提出：“每人五工贺新年，百担肥料庆新春”。
    全县初一、初二两天出勤的有二十七万二千七百六十一人。这在千年历史上从未有过的纪录。群众说得好：“旧社会苦干为地主，新社会苦干为自己，为了生产大跃进，即使千年老习惯，也不能阻挡我们前进。”
    红旗竞赛
    学先进，赶先进，出力又出汗，争取第一名。这是常熟英雄人民的信念。他们形容自己的干劲是“车河像青龙戏水，挑泥如猛虎下山”。
    在中共常熟县委的庄严号召下，每个区每个乡每个社都订了自己的规划，并且不断和保守的思想做斗争，一再修订规划。规划既定，目标明确，就鼓足干劲，乘长风破万里浪，奋勇前进，展开社会主义竞赛。评比竞赛往年也有，一年一次，但实际上缺乏监督，一年竞赛完了，第二年才给奖，这样很迟缓，不能推动生产。现在的评比竞赛却和往年大不相同了，当时评，当时奖。奖品由县长和县委书记颁发，有的还敲锣打鼓，送到田里去，群众非常喜欢。
    平时，每五天，或者七天，全社全乡评比一次。评到第一的，夺取一面红旗，上面写着：“一马当先，保持荣誉”；一般的是绿旗，上面写的是“快马加鞭”，希望赶上红旗；落后的叫做掉队社，给的是黑旗，上书八个大字：“鼓足干劲，急起直追”。每个社自己都有这三面旗子，评到什么，就拿什么旗子下地。
    我们在四五十公里的路上，看到的满眼都是红旗，很少看到绿旗，黑旗只看到一面。拿到黑旗的，心里当然很不好受。社里得了黑旗，社干部立即召开会议，自己首先检讨，社员们也个个鼓足干劲，一定要赶上先进，夺取红旗。像我们在去南丰路上看到的那面黑旗，群众干劲特别足，等我们从南丰回来，暮色已经升起，苍茫茫一片，快看不见了，可是插着黑旗那片土地上，人们还在努力干着。
    经过第二次评比，黑旗社往往跃进到红旗社。先进当中有先进，先进没有止境。如果没有评比指标，那和最先进的比起来，总有比较落后的，而落后的得到黑旗，别说群众，就是干部也是伤心的。这对于群众的心理可能有一种副作用。因此，是否需要采取插蓝旗、黑旗这种强烈对比和刺激的方法，我们和一些负责实际工作的同志交换了意见，看法不完全一致，这个问题，还值得研究。县委和苏州地委已经注意到了这个问题，首先规定了评比指标，并且评比指标数字，以每一次评比为单位，不把过去已完成的数字积累起来计算，这样社社可以得红旗，掉队社也容易变为先进社。
    一浪推一浪，跃进再跃进，整个常熟的土地已经改变了面貌：小河条条翻，大河条条开，挑泥像穿梭，河泥堆成山。
    3月1日，全县已完成水利二千九百一十四万方土，占全年任务61.8％；积肥七亿五千四百三十七万担，占全年任务56.3％；绿化，造林一千二百二十八亩，植树一千二百四十八万株，每户平均四十九株。
    根据现在飞跃的速度看，不久一定又要突破规划了。
    “一年早知道”
    有了县乡社的规划，互相评比竞赛，如何使运动在可靠的基础上持久下去，这是一个很大的问题。首先是劳动问题，一个人劳动的强度总有一定的限度，几天几夜不睡觉也不可能成为经常的情况。一方面要尽量发挥劳动的积极性，一方面要及时地考虑农具改良，这样结合起来，一定可以进一步发挥劳动的潜力，提高工作效率，并且经常保持下去。白茆乡在运动中创造了牛拉壅土拍麦机，可以提高工效十倍；创造了土造起重机，一天一个人能完成十方土，运土机一天一人能完成十二方土。今后再挖塘，就不用人挑了。这个创造是乡、社干部和铁匠木匠座谈研究的结果。
    除了已有县、乡、社的规划，还得有个人的规划。为了保证生产大跃进的规划的彻底实现，白茆乡和平二社制定了“一年早知道”，实际上就是个人规划。具体做法是：
    一、“一年早知道”图表：根据生产大跃进形势和规划，制定生产规划，做好大小熟三包，一包产（亩产九百斤），二包工（全社总工分比去年增加了14％），三包本（指标比去年增加）。三包指标订出了全社收支方案，计算每户劳动日一元零四分，社员平均每人纯收入比去年增加46％。社员自报评定劳动日，每户订出全年收支计划。
    二、“基本劳动日制度”，就是劳动规划，根据三包工和全社劳动情况，确定各种劳动力的出勤数和得工数，树立标准，社员自报投工数，评议定案。有全年劳动规划，还有四季劳动规划，按季评比，年终奖励。
    三、“按剩余劳动日预支，根据社员每季实做工，扣除口粮、劳动日后，按剩余劳动日预支，剩余工多，预支多；剩余少，预支少。
    这三项是计划管理上的三宝。
    户户开家庭会议，人人自报出勤投工数，领导审查，评议定案，然后每家挂上“一年早知道”图表。古话说的好：“穿不穷，吃不穷，没有计划一世穷”。农民赞成“一年早知道”：“心中有数，干活有劲”。
    国家大跃进生产计划放在广大群众的基础上，那就获得了最可靠的保证。个人利益和集体利益一致，群众劳动热情一定会永远保持着饱满的状态。
    “增产措施千万条，干部领导头一条。”
    这是在常熟人民当中流传的一句话，也就是说：关键在于领导。
    常熟生产运动的特点是：发展快，来势猛，干劲足，敢想敢做，想到做到，说做就做，计划不断突破。广大群众提出生动而又豪迈的口号：“不怕做不到，就怕想不到，只要能想到，一定能达到”；并且是“前人不敢想的，我们敢想；前人不敢做的，我们敢做。”群众要求：“苦干再苦干，高潮接高潮”。这样前无古人气吞河山的英雄，有着钢铁般的意志和排山倒海的力量，有什么事不能完成呢？
    中共常熟县委怎样领导全县英雄们跃进的呢？党委领导，全党动员。明确农业生产是一切工作的中心，书记挂帅，亲自抓农业生产。全县划分五大片，分工包干，负责到底，要做到片片有基点，乡乡有典型，社社有榜样，由点到面，使计划全部贯彻到底。领导干部学技术，做到又红又专。不懂生产很难把生产领导好。县、乡、社、队的干部每人要搞试验田。全县有三万五千亩试验田。陈锦美同志带我们到南丰乡看他的试验田。试验田由三部分人合搞：领导干部、技术干部和富有经验的老农。田上插了木牌，写上指标，便于检查。这样不仅可以达到又红又专，而且可以加强对生产的具体领导，掌握先进经验，大力贯彻“多、快、好、省”的方针，不断促进生产大跃进，运动一步一步深入，胜利接着胜利，善始善终。
    解决思想问题，通过大鸣大放大辩论，端正政治方向。政治方向不正确，生产运动没有根。其次是通过“想、比、找、算”。进行五回忆五对比：回忆过去小农经济情况，对比合作化的优越性；回忆1955年高级化后冬春生产劲头，比当前生产决心；回忆人民解放军战斗精神，比自己生产劲头；回忆自己对困难的态度，比麻城县生产决心。开展三找：找1957年生产经验教训，找1958年增产潜力，找贯彻冬春三大任务的措施。发动四算：算苦干，实干和大跃进的关系账，算积肥、水利、绿化和农业增产的关系账，算生产大跃进和增加收入、改善生活、支援工业化的关系账，算先苦后甜实现社会主义美满前途账。通过这样“想、比、找、算”，打破了右倾保守思想，鼓足了干部和群众的革命干劲。
    在一切运动中，总会出现先进、中间和落后的不同类型，特别是在生产运动飞跃发展下，先进与落后不同情况出现得更快，变化也很快。今天先进，明天可能落后；今天落后，明天又可能先进，要不断接受好的经验、坏的教训。领导要抓两头带中间。这是一个辩证的方法。陈锦美同志说：哪里先进就到哪里开会、传播经验，外宽内紧，实际上是督促先进的不要骄傲自满；哪里落后就到哪里检查，接受教训，外紧内宽，实际上是帮助他工作，使落后赶上先进。
    社会主义竞赛和评比是全民全面工作的竞赛和评比。通过评比竞赛一定会端正政治方向，克服保守思想，促使思想、生产和工作全面跃进，制定先进指标，鼓足革命干劲。先进带动落后，落后赶上先进，反过来又可以促使先进再先进。对先进要表扬，对落后要帮助。除了登报、参观、给奖等以外，常熟还采取送对联的办法。送先进社的对联是：“跃进再跃进，迎春干劲足，胜利接胜利，新年第一名”。送一般社的对联是：“奋发图强赶先进，力争上游防落后”。也有采取“留言”的方法。对先进社是：“英雄顶天立地，眼睛向往大地，白手起家，扬眉吐气。”留给落后社的是：“一般还好，问题不少，究其原因，干劲太少。”在社会主义竞赛的鼓舞下，落后的在很短的时间内都很快赶上了先进。
    常熟这次生产大跃进，是一个高潮接着一个高潮，各级领导的规划一次又一次给突破，正如三月三日中共中央发出的“关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示”所说的一样：“在运动过程中，会不断出现惊人的奇迹，出现各种平日难以达到的先进的速度和先进的指标，树立起各种先进的典型和旗帜。原来设想和安排好的平衡，也会不断地被万马奔腾的群众运动所突破。”毛主席说：“不平衡是普遍客观的规律。从不平衡到平衡，又从平衡到不平衡，循环不已，永远如此，但是每一循环都进到高的一级。”因此，领导上的责任就要以先进为榜样，经常的及时的提出新的目标新的任务，“从不平衡到平衡，又从平衡到不平衡，循环不已”，使运动永远前进！
    常熟农民在建设社会主义中，写下了英雄的史诗，我们热烈地向他们致敬。（完）
    （更正：昨日本报误将中共常熟县委书记隋性初排为惰性初，特此更正。）
