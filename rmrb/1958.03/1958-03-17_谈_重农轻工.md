Reading the newspapers of the past month or so, the news of the great leap forward in local industry is very inspiring. Many provinces, cities, prefectures, and counties have put forward plans for a simultaneous leap forward in industry and agriculture, striving to have the total output value of industry catch up with or surpass that of agriculture within the next seven, six, five, or even two years. However, amidst this nationwide surge in the development of local industry, there are still some leaders in certain prefectures and counties who have yet to put the development of industry on the agenda. Some have even transferred cadres originally responsible for managing industry to rural areas to engage in water conservancy construction and spring plowing, as if the task of developing industry has nothing to do with them.

Industry and agriculture are the two major pillars of the national economy. Industry cannot develop without the support of agriculture, and agriculture cannot develop without industry. Now, inspired by the National Program for Agricultural Development, the nation's farmers are advancing towards nature with overwhelming force. In order to achieve the "four, five, eight" targets as soon as possible, farmers have already begun to ask industry for mechanized or semi-mechanized farm tools, chemical fertilizers, modern power equipment, and transportation vehicles. To meet these needs of agriculture, it is imperative to greatly develop local industry. Qinxian County in Shanxi Province has developed local industry, and agriculture is "crossing the Yellow River" and "spanning the Yangtze River," having everything it needs. Yuxi Prefecture in Yunnan Province relied on other provinces for even chopsticks and buckets in the early days of liberation. After vigorously developing local industry over the past few years, it can basically achieve farmland water conservancy, semi-mechanization of cultivation, electrification, and chemicalization of fertilizers within five years. However, some prefectural and county Party committees have not actively developed industry, waiting for the state to invest in building industry and waiting for support from large cities. As a result, the state and large cities cannot meet their needs, and once the situation of great agricultural development arrives, the pace cannot be accelerated due to the lack of support from local industry.

People's thinking often lags behind reality, and this is another proof of that. In the past, the productive forces in rural areas were just liberated from feudal ownership and individual ownership, and the demand for industrial products in rural areas was not large. Even if there was little industry in the county and prefecture, it could still be met by relying on large cities. At that time, it was very necessary for the prefectural and county Party committees to focus on both agriculture. However, everything develops in the struggle of contradictions. Today's rural areas are no longer the rural areas of last year, but rural areas that urgently require transforming their backward technical appearance. The rural demand for industrial products has developed from quantitative change to qualitative change. To adapt to this new situation, Party committees above the county level must undergo a major transformation, from focusing on agriculture with both hands to focusing on agriculture with one hand and industry with the other, so that local industry can develop like ten thousand arrows being fired simultaneously, like ten thousand horses galloping forward. This is a major turning point of important historical significance. However, the thinking of some comrades cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation, and their understanding remains at the old stage, unable to make the turn at this historical turning point. We hope that these comrades will catch up quickly and change their old ways of thinking and working. Only in this way can they stand at the forefront of the wheels of history and act as guides.

Of course, developing local industry will encounter some difficulties, such as lack of funds, insufficient technical strength, and inability to purchase equipment. However, difficulties can be overcome. The experiences of Qinxian County in Shanxi, Jiyuan County in Henan, and Yuxi Prefecture in Yunnan tell us that as long as we have determination and drive, overcome the idea of relying on the state and large cities, look downwards, rely on the masses, make do with whatever is available, and rely on our own efforts, we will definitely be able to develop local industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    谈“重农轻工”
    王朴
    打开最近一个多月来的报纸，地方工业跃进的消息十分振奋人心。许多省、市、专区和县都提出了工农业并肩跃进的规划，争取在今后七年、六年、五年、甚至两年内，使工业总产值赶上或超过农业的总产值。然而，在这举国一片发展地方工业声中，还有一些专区和县的领导人员，至今还没有把发展工业提到议事日程上来，有的甚至把原来负责管理工业的干部调到农村去搞水利建设，搞春耕生产，仿佛发展工业的任务跟他们无关似的。
    工业和农业是国民经济的两大支柱。工业固然不能在没有农业支援的情况下发展，农业也不能离开工业而发展。现在，全国农民在农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，正以排山倒海之势向大自然进军。为了争取早日实现“四”“五”“八”，农民已经开始伸手向工业要机械化的或半机械化的农具，要化学肥料，要现代的动力设备，要交通工具。为了满足农业的这些需要，非大大发展地方工业不可。山西沁县发展了地方工业，农业过“黄河”跨“长江”，要啥有啥。云南玉溪专区在解放初期连一双筷子、一只水桶都靠外省供应，几年来大力发展地方工业以后，在五年内就可以基本实现农田水利化、耕作半机械化、电气化和肥料化学化。而有些地委和县委没有积极发展工业，等待国家投资办工业，等待大城市支援。结果国家和大城市不能满足自己的要求，一旦农业大发展的形势到来，因为没有地方工业的支援，步子就迈不大开。
    人们的思想往往落后于实际，这又是一个证明。过去，农村的生产力刚刚从封建所有制和个体所有制下解放出来，农村要求的工业品数量不多，即使县和专区的工业很少，依靠大城市也还能满足需要。那时候，地委和县委两手抓农业，是很必要的。但是，一切事物都在矛盾的斗争中发展着。现在的农村已非去年的农村，而是迫切要求改造自己落后的技术面貌的农村。农村对工业品的需要，已经从量变发展到质变。为了适应这个新形势，县以上的党委必须来一个大转变，从双手抓农业转变为一手抓农业，一手抓工业，让地方工业像万箭齐发，万马齐奔般发展起来。这是一个有重要的历史意义的大转折。但是，有些同志的思想跟不上客观形势的发展，认识仍停留在旧阶段，在这个历史的转变关头，拐不过弯来。我们希望这些同志赶快跟上来，改变自己旧的思想习惯和工作习惯。这样才能站在历史车轮的前头充任向导。
    要发展地方工业，当然会遇到一些困难，如资金缺乏，技术力量不足，设备买不到等等。然而困难是可以克服的。山西沁县、河南济源县、云南玉溪专区的经验告诉我们，只要有决心、有干劲，克服依赖国家依赖大城市的思想，眼睛向下，依靠群众，因陋就简，自力更生，一定能够又多又快又好又省地发展地方工业。
