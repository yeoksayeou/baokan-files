    Xinghua County: High Yields of Rapeseed
    In 1957, Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, had 52,561 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of 185.4 jin per mu. This yield is more than 270% higher than the national average rapeseed yield, making it the county with the highest rapeseed yield per unit area in the country.
    Xinghua County is located in northern Jiangsu, with relatively low winter temperatures and frequent rain and snow, so natural conditions are not good. However, this county has created a large-scale, high-yield record. In addition to the importance attached by the leadership and the high enthusiasm of the masses for production, a number of yield-increasing measures have been taken in production.

    兴化油菜籽高产县
    江苏省兴化县1957年全县五万二千五百六十一亩油菜，平均亩产一百八十五点四斤。这个产量高出全国油菜平均产量270％以上，是全国油菜单位产量最高的县。
    兴化县在江苏北部，冬季气温较低，雨雪较多，自然条件并不好。但是，这个县却创造了大面积高额丰产纪录。这除了领导部门重视，群众生产热情高涨以外，在生产上还采取了不少增产措施。
