Xinhua News Agency, Naha, March 29th: The Okinawa Prosecutor's Office filed charges on March 28 against Kamejiro Senaga, the former mayor of Naha, who was forced out of office by the U.S. occupation authorities and is the chairman of the Okinawa "League for the Defense of Democracy" ("Minren"), and Kisaaburo Oban (transliteration), the secretary-general of "Minren," on the "grounds" that they "engaged in the activities of an unregistered political party."

This new act of persecution against Senaga and others by the Okinawa authorities has aroused strong opposition from the people of Japan and Okinawa. The Japanese Communist Party and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan have both sent telegrams protesting the Okinawa authorities' persecution of Senaga and others.

    美国迫害冲绳民主力量
    前那霸市长被起诉
    据新华社29日讯　那霸消息：冲绳检察厅在3月28日对美国占领当局迫使去职的前那霸市市长、冲绳“拥护民主主义联络协议会”（“民联”）议长濑长龟次郎和“民联”书记长大湾喜三郎（译音）提起诉讼，“理由”是他们“曾经从事没有登记的政党的活动”。
    冲绳当局对濑长等进行的这一新的迫害行为引起日本和冲绳人民的强烈反对。日本共产党和日本工会总评议会都发出电报，抗议冲绳当局迫害濑长等的行动。
