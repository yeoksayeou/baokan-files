    There Must Be Concrete Organizational Measures
    Tian Linmao
    According to incomplete statistics, more than 400 counties and cities across the country plan to meet the grain production increase targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program this year, and more than 100 counties and cities plan to reach 100 jin in ginned cotton production. Among them, many counties and cities in the north have also put forward ambitious plans to "cross the Yellow River" and "cross the Yangtze River."
    Plans are the guide to action. With a plan, there is a goal to strive for. But plans are, after all, just plans. There is still an arduous process of effort between the formulation and realization of a plan. Whether a plan can be realized depends on whether each link in the entire process has corresponding organizational measures. Now that spring plowing and production are about to begin, whether timely spring sowing can be carried out with quality and quantity is the first hurdle facing the great leap forward plan.
    When Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, recently inspected the spring plowing preparations of some agricultural cooperatives, it found that some agricultural cooperatives only had plans but no action, and some, although they took action, the measures did not conform to the plans, or could not keep up with the needs of the plans. Why is this happening? It is said that a few cadres were not very serious when making plans. Their attitude was: if others order a thousand jin, I can't order nine hundred and ninety. The target is set like this first, and whether it can be achieved will be discussed in the future. These people are deaf and blind to the new situation, unable to see the changes in production conditions and the improvement of the masses' awareness, lack confidence in the Great Leap Forward, and neither study specific organizational measures for the production increase plans they put forward, nor plan to realize them 100%. They just say it and forget it. If this situation is not changed immediately, the production increase plan will fail.
    Using comparisons to promote the adoption of concrete organizational measures in various places and to promote the preparation for spring plowing and production is of great significance at present. This kind of comparison can make those areas and units with lagging concrete work suddenly realize and quickly find ways to remedy them. Some places have slackened off due to their great achievements in the previous stage, and they will also be shocked and nervous because of the comparison. This will enable the vigorous drive since winter to continue, and this drive will be maintained in spring plowing and production and even throughout the year's work.
    Changes in production conditions have created many new problems: new water conservancy projects must be used, so it is necessary to increase water lifting tools and paddy rice seeds, flatten fields and build ridges, and formulate water use systems and methods. With the increase of labor projects, agricultural cooperatives also need to be better consolidated to improve everyone's enthusiasm and initiative, and to carry out deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Otherwise, water conservancy projects cannot be fully utilized.
    Whether the increase in production measures can meet the needs of the leap forward plan is a problem that should be paid special attention to in this year's spring plowing preparation. Now, the time is very pressing. All localities need to organize forces to carefully check the preparation work and solve problems immediately. This is an indispensable step in striving for a "great leap forward."

    要有切实的组织措施
    田林茂
    据不完全的统计，全国目前已有四百多个县市计划在今年达到农业发展纲要规定的粮食增产指标，有一百多个县市的皮棉产量计划达到百斤。其中北方的很多县市，还提出了“跨黄河”、“过长江”的雄伟计划。
    计划是行动的指南，有了计划就有了奋斗目标。但计划毕竟还是计划，从计划的制定到实现，其间还有一个艰巨的努力过程。计划能否实现，要看全部过程中的每一个环节是否都有相应的组织措施。现在春耕生产马上就要开始，能否如质如量地及时春播，是大跃进计划面临的第一关。
    浙江黄岩县不久前检查一些农业社备耕工作的时候，发现有的农业社只有计划没有行动，有的虽有行动，但措施与计划不符合，或者赶不上计划的需要。为什么会有这种现象呢？据说有少数干部在订计划的时候就不很认真，他们的态度是：别人订了一千斤，我也不能九百九。指标先这样订了，能否实现将来再说。这些人在新形势面前如瞽如聋，看不到生产条件的改变和群众觉悟的提高，对大跃进缺乏信心，对自己提出的增产计划既不研究具体的组织措施，也不打算百分之百地实现，他们是说过就算了。这种情形如不马上改变，增产的计划会落空的。
    用评比的办法来推动各地采取具体的组织措施，推动春耕生产的准备工作，在目前有十分重大的意义。这种评比可以使那些具体工作落后的地区和单位猛省，赶快想办法进行补救。有一些地方因上一段取得较大成绩而松懈下来，也会因评比而大吃一惊，紧张起来。这就会使冬季以来蓬蓬勃勃的干劲继续保持下去，在春耕生产以至全年工作中坚持这种干劲。
    生产条件的改变，产生了许多新问题：新修的水利工程要使用，就要增加提水工具和水田种子，需要平田整畦，需要制订用水制度和办法。劳动项目增加了，农业社也就需要整顿得更好些，提高大家的热情和积极性，深耕细作。不然，有了水利工程也不能充分发挥作用的。
    增产措施能否满足跃进计划的需要，是今年春耕准备中应该特别注意的问题。现在，时机已很紧迫了，各地需要组织力量，认真检查一下备耕工作，发现问题立即解决，这是争取“大跃进”必不可少的步骤。
