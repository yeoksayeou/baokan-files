Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 21st. Lu Dingyi, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave a speech on the 19th at the conclusion of the agricultural middle school 座谈会 convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee. He said that this 座谈会 proved that vocational middle schools, with agricultural middle schools as the main form, are very necessary. This kind of vocational middle school not only meets the needs of production development, but also enables a great leap forward in education. It is correct to say that we have found the key. Your large-scale establishment of agricultural middle schools solves the problem of schooling for hundreds of thousands of graduating elementary school students. By doing so, the popularization of primary school education, which was previously considered difficult, can be realized quickly, and the education work will show a situation of all-round leap forward.

He asked everyone to work hard for three years to develop and consolidate agricultural middle schools. He said that agricultural middle schools can be established quickly, in large numbers, and economically, and at the same time, they must be well-managed. Jiangsu has a large number of agricultural middle schools to establish. In the first year of establishment, there may be fewer problems, but in the second and third years, there will be more problems, mainly the shortage of teachers and school administrators. We must foresee these difficulties in advance, make overall plans, follow the mass line, work hard for three years, and develop and consolidate agricultural middle schools.

Lu Dingyi explained the guiding principles of China's socialist education. He said: Our slogan is: to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and cultural knowledge. This slogan requires students to have socialist consciousness, cultural knowledge, and be laborers capable of production. Laborers have various different occupations. Workers, peasants, teachers, engineers, etc. are different occupations. Laborers of different occupations must be proficient in different skills. Abstract laborers do not exist in the world. Therefore, all-round development must be combined with teaching students according to their aptitude. All-round development is the combination of mental and physical labor, that is, to have socialist consciousness, cultural knowledge, and be able to labor; teaching students according to their aptitude is to provide different vocational skills training to different people in various occupations. Not only that, but each student has a different personality, and they must also be taught according to their aptitude.

Lu Dingyi especially emphasized that cultural, educational, scientific, health and other work must be carried out under the close leadership of the Party, and earnestly serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and must not "be for culture for the sake of culture" or "be for education for the sake of education". Which cultural and educational projects should make a great leap forward and which projects should not make a great leap forward must be selected, and priorities must be distinguished. The standard is whether it directly or indirectly benefits the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and how urgent the need is. He said: People who do cultural and educational work, including party members, often easily produce the tendency of "for culture for the sake of culture" and "for education for the sake of education." This problem deserves special attention. Our cultural and educational workers must serve the current politics and serve the development of productivity. To do this, we need the close leadership of the Party committee. Everyone who does cultural and educational work should be both red and expert. Lu Dingyi pointed out that the biggest waste in education is that the people cultivated do not have socialist consciousness in their minds, do not have cultural knowledge, or their knowledge is very poor, and they cannot labor or despise labor. The anti-waste and anti-conservative movement in schools should focus on this issue and work hard to improve it.

Lu Dingyi finally emphasized that China's socialist construction must strive for the highest possible speed, must be more, faster, better and more economical, must go all out, and strive for the upstream.

    教育要为促进生产力服务
    陆定一在江苏农业中学座谈会结束时讲话
    新华社南京21日电　中共中央政治局候补委员、中共中央宣传部长陆定一19日在江苏省委召开的农业中学座谈会结束时讲了话。他说，这次座谈会证明以农业中学为主要形式的职业中学是很需要的。这种职业中学不但合乎生产发展的需要，同时又使教育工作大跃进。说我们找到了钥匙，是很对的。你们大规模地办农业中学，解决几十万高小毕业生的就学问题，这样做了，从前认为很难办到的小学教育的普及，就可以很快实现，教育工作就出现了全面跃进的形势。
    他要求大家苦干三年，发展和巩固农业中学。他说，农业中学可以又多又快又省地办起来，同时又必须办好。江苏要办的农业中学数量很大。办起来，第一年可能问题少，第二年、第三年问题就会多起来，主要是教师和办学干部不够。要预先看到这种困难，全面规划，走群众路线，苦干三年，把农业中学发展和巩固下来。
    陆定一解释了我国社会主义教育事业的方针。他说：我们的口号是：培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化知识的劳动者。这个口号，要求学生有社会主义的觉悟，要求学生有文化知识，要求学生是能够生产的劳动者。劳动者有各种各样不同职业。工人、农民、教师、工程师等等，就是不同的职业。不同职业的劳动者要熟练不同的技能。抽象的劳动者，世界上是不会有的。所以，全面发展要和因材施教相结合。全面发展，就是脑力劳动与体力劳动的结合，就是要有社会主义觉悟，有文化知识，又能劳动；因材施教，就是对各种职业不同的人给以不同的职业技能的训练。不但如此，每个学生个性不同，也必须因材施教。
    陆定一特别强调文化、教育、科学、卫生等项工作，一定要在党的密切领导下，认真为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，千万不能“为文化而文化”、“为教育而教育”。文教工作那些项目应该大跃进，那些项目不应该大跃进，要有所选择，要分别轻重缓急。标准就是是否直接或间接有利于社会主义革命和社会主义建设，需要的迫切程度如何。他说：做文教工作的人，包括党员在内，常常容易产生“为文化而文化”、“为教育而教育”的偏向。这个问题特别值得注意。我们文教工作者一定要为当前的政治服务，为促进生产力的发展服务。要做到这样，就需要有党委的密切领导。做文教工作的人，每个人应该又红又专。陆定一指出，在教育方面最大的浪费，是培养出来的人在思想上没有社会主义觉悟，没有文化知识或知识很差，不会劳动或轻视劳动。学校里的反浪费反保守运动，要着重注意这个问题，并在工作中努力改进。
    陆定一最后强调我国社会主义建设必须争取尽可能的最高速度，必须又多又快又好又省，必须鼓足干劲，力争上游。
