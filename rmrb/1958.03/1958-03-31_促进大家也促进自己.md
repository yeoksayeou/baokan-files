    Promoting Everyone Also Promotes Oneself
    Yi Huai
    It is a good thing for the branch to carry out appraisal and competition, which can promote everyone and also promote oneself. If you don't make a great leap forward or a small leap forward yourself, but you want to lead others in a great leap forward, it's like you're walking slowly while leading others to run, which is a joke. Originally, among the twelve branches of Beijing Fengtai Railway Station, the organizational work and publicity work of six branches were not done well, so their leadership in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement was weak. During the movement, the criticism was not deep or thorough enough, and the criticism of conservative ideas was not strong enough. In order to improve the work of the branches, the Fengtai District Railway Station Party Committee launched a competition among the branches. In just over a month, the backward branches have made progress. Facts have proved that the method of appraisal and competition is an effective method to promote the work of the branches.
    Some comrades may feel that it is of course no problem for the branch work to make a leap forward, but is it necessary to adopt the method of appraisal and competition? There are many ways to promote branch work, but appraisal and competition are indeed one of the good ways. Carrying out appraisal and competition can mobilize the study of advanced elements, comparison with advanced elements, and catching up with advanced elements. This is much better than burying oneself in one's own work; after carrying out appraisal and competition, everyone often comments and compares together, which can not only discover advanced elements and establish banners in a timely manner, but also urge the intermediate and backward elements to learn from the advanced. This kind of mass mutual promotion is better than just the Party Committee's inspection and supervision. Advanced experience in branch work can also be generated from here, which will be more complete and substantial than the experience of a single advanced unit, and can be continuously developed and enriched with the appraisal.
    Branch work is not like production, where it is difficult to set specific indicators for quality and quantity. Will appraisal and competition be difficult? In branch work, you may be better in this aspect, and he may be stronger in that aspect. It is sometimes not easy to distinguish between high and low, and to rank first and second. However, this does not matter. The purpose of appraisal and competition in branch work is first of all to exchange experience, learn from each other's strengths, overcome weaknesses, promote each other, and improve together. Although there are the difficulties mentioned above, judging from the situation of the Fengtai Railway Station branch, this goal can be fully achieved. Moreover, difficulties are not insurmountable. The Fengtai Railway Station branch has not been carrying out competition for a long time, but they have adapted to the new problems that have emerged in the competition and have come up with some solutions. If everyone engages in appraisal and competition, experience can be gradually enriched, and a set of appraisal and competition methods that are adapted to the specific conditions of branch work can be gradually found.

    促进大家也促进自己

    支部开展评比竞赛，是一件好事情，既能促进大家又能促进自己。自己不跃进或小跃进，而要去领导人家大跃进，就像自己迈着方步，却要去领着别人跑步，这是笑话。北京丰台车站原来十二个支部中有六个支部的组织工作和宣传工作作得不好，他们对反浪费反保守运动的领导就没有力量，运动中鸣放的不深不透，对保守思想批判不力。为了改进支部工作，丰台区车站党委发动支部开展评比竞赛，仅仅一个多月的时间，工作落后的支部都有了进步，事实证明，评比竞赛的方法是促进支部工作的一种有效的方法。
    有些同志会觉得，支部工作要跃进，当然没有问题，可是，是不是一定要采取评比竞赛的办法呢？促进支部工作的方法很多，但是，评比竞赛确是好办法之一。开展评比竞赛，就可以发动学先进、比先进、赶先进，这比埋头各干各的就好得多；开展了评比竞赛，大家经常在一起评论一番，比较一番，既可以及时发现先进，树立旗帜，又可以督促中间和落后的，向先进看齐。这种群众性的互相促进，比仅仅由党委来检查督促要好得多。支部工作中的先进经验也正可从这里产生，它会比单单一个先进单位的经验更为完整充实，而且，可以随着评比，不断发展，更加丰富。
    支部工作不像生产，质量、数量都很难订出具体的指标，评比竞赛是不是会有困难呢？支部工作中，你在这方面好些，他在那方面强些，要分个高低，排个先后，有时也不容易。不过，这并不要紧。支部工作评比竞赛的目的，首先是交流经验、取长补短、互相促进、共同提高。虽说有上面谈到的那些困难，从丰台车站支部的情况看，这个目的是完全可以达到的。而且，困难也不是不能克服的。丰台车站支部开展竞赛的时间并不长，可是，他们适应竞赛中出现的新问题，想出了一些解决的办法。如果大家都来搞评比竞赛，经验就可以慢慢丰富起来，逐渐找出一套适应支部工作的具体情况的评比竞赛办法。
