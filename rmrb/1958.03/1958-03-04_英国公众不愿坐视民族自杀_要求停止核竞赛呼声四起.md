Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, London: According to TASS, two hundred and four professors, lecturers, and scientific workers from the University of London have submitted a petition to British Prime Minister Macmillan, as well as Labour Party leaders Gaitskell and Bevan, demanding that Britain "halt hydrogen weapon testing before international negotiations on nuclear disarmament begin," cease the flight of bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs, and refuse to establish rocket bases.

According to the "Sunday Times," Oxford University students have also launched a broad campaign to "persuade the government to stop producing nuclear weapons and destroy nuclear weapon stockpiles." The student newspaper "Cherwell" demands that Britain stop producing nuclear weapons and destroy existing nuclear weapon stockpiles. The student newspaper points out that "a Britain with bombs faces greater dangers than a Britain without bombs," and accuses: "Despite Russia's patience and constructive suggestions, Western obstinacy always hinders the achievement of disarmament agreements."

The "Reynolds News" editorial pointed out that stopping nuclear weapon tests and abandoning the construction of rocket bases are "the most important issues of British policy." The newspaper emphasized that participating in the nuclear arms race is tantamount to "national suicide" for Britain, and that the existence of nuclear weapons and rocket weapons puts densely populated countries like Britain at risk of being destroyed by nuclear war.

The "Observer" believes that the petition from the University of London professors is of great significance. The newspaper said: "The shadow of the hydrogen bomb is falling on Britain, dividing the country and parties, and causing deep public unease."

Labour Party left-wing Member of Parliament Zilliacus gave a speech at a mass rally in London on March 1, condemning the West's nuclear arms race policy and expressing opposition to the Labour Party's right-wing leaders' support for the government's "nuclear deterrence" policy.

The Chairman of the British Labour Party National Executive Committee, Driberg, delivered a speech in Leeds on March 1, saying that active steps should be taken gradually to get rid of the threat of nuclear weapons. In this regard, the Labour Party believes that it is best to adopt the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude an agreement on not using nuclear weapons. He said that this agreement would help create a more favorable atmosphere for high-level talks.

    英国公众不愿坐视民族自杀
    要求停止核竞赛呼声四起
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：伦敦大学二百零四名教授、讲师和科学工作者向英国首相麦克米伦以及工党领袖盖次克尔和比万递交了一份请愿书，要求英国“在裁减核军备的国际谈判开始之前”停止氢武器试验，制止载有原子弹和氢弹的轰炸机飞行，并且拒绝建立火箭基地。
    据“星期日泰晤士报”报道，牛津大学的学生也展开了“劝说政府停止生产核武器和销毁核武器储存”的广泛运动。学生报纸“繁育女神”要求英国停止生产核武器和销毁现有的核武器储存。这个学生报纸指出，“一个有炸弹的英国面临着的危险比一个没有炸弹的英国所面临着的危险要大”，并且指责说：“尽管俄国很耐心并且提出建设性建议，但是西方的固执总是妨碍达成裁军协议。”
    “雷诺新闻”的社论指出，停止试验核武器和放弃建设火箭基地是“英国政策的最重要的问题”。这家报纸强调指出，参加核军备竞赛对于英国来说等于“民族自杀”，核武器和火箭武器的存在使得像英国这样人口稠密的国家有被核战争毁灭的危险。
      “观察家报”认为，伦敦大学的教授们的请愿书有很大意义。这家报纸说：“氢弹的阴影降临在英国头上，它使国家和党派分裂，使公众深感不安。”
    工党左翼议员齐里亚库斯3月1日在伦敦的群众集会上发表演说谴责了西方的核竞赛政策，并且表示反对工党右翼领袖支持政府的“核威慑”政策。
    英国工党全国执行委员会主席德赖伯3月1日在里子发表演说，他说，应该逐步采取积极步骤，来摆脱核武器的威胁。在这方面，工党认为最好是采纳苏联关于就不使用核武器缔结协定的建议。他说，这种协定将有助于为高级会谈创造更有利的气氛。
