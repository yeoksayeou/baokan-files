    The Debate on Modern Dramas

    The fifth issue of "Drama News" published Comrade Lin Mohan's speech at the Capital Drama and Music Creation Symposium, in which he mentioned the debate on modern dramas, especially spoken dramas. His views have basically resolved this issue. Since November of last year, "Wenhui Daily" and "Drama News" have successively launched discussions on modern dramas. Comrade Lin Mohan said that there were no fundamentally opposing views between the two sides of the discussion, only that the estimations of the play performances in various theaters in the previous period were not completely consistent in degree. It can be seen from the discussion that everyone has different interpretations of the term modern drama. If, according to the division of world historical stages, dramas depicting the life and struggle in China since the "May Fourth" Movement, that is, since the New Democratic Revolution, are all called modern dramas, it is in line with the division of world and Chinese historical stages.

    He also pointed out: It is the sacred duty of contemporary writers and artists to reflect socialist revolution and socialist construction more and better; theaters should attach great importance to such works and should not adopt a cold or contemptuous attitude towards them simply because they are relatively immature; at the same time, we should not put dramas reflecting socialist real life in opposition to other types of dramas. The theater's repertoire should still be diversified, especially works depicting the history of China's revolutionary struggle, which are not too many now, but too few. (Lan)

    关于现代剧目的争论
    “戏剧报”第五期上刊登了林默涵同志在首都戏剧、音乐创作座谈会上的发言，其中提到了关于戏剧、特别是话剧的现代剧目的争论，他的意见基本上解决了这个问题。自从去年11月以来，“文汇报”和“戏剧报”相继展开了关于现代剧目的讨论。林默涵同志说，讨论双方并没有根本对立的意见，只是对前一个时期各剧院上演剧目情况的估计在程度上不完全一致。从讨论中可以看出，大家对现代剧目这个说法的解释有分歧。如果根据世界历史阶段的划分，把描写我国“五四”以来也就是新民主主义革命以来的生活和斗争的剧目都称为现代剧目，是符合世界和我国历史阶段的划分的。
    他还指出：更多更好地反映社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是当代作家和艺术家的神圣职责；剧院对于这类作品要有充分的重视，不应该因为它们比较幼稚而采取冷淡或轻视的态度；同时，我们也不要把反映社会主义现实生活的剧目，去同别种剧目对立起来，剧院的演出节目还是应该多样化，特别是描写我国革命斗争历史的作品，现在不是太多，而是太少。　　　（兰）
