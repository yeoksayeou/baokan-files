Turning Production Increase Plans into Mass Action
Commentator of this newspaper

Units planning to achieve the "four, five, eight" grain targets this year are still emerging. As of March 10th, 727 counties and cities across the country had already set such plans. This is encouraging news.

Plans are a guide to action, and advanced plans can further inspire the revolutionary drive of the masses. However, to realize the plans, we must have practical measures to increase production, and implement them in a timely manner among the peasant masses, so that they truly become the goals of the masses' own struggle and the actual actions of millions of people.

Many regions already have practical measures, and the cadres and masses in those regions are working hard to realize the plans with full confidence. However, some places have only put forward advanced production increase targets without practical measures. Some have put forward some effective measures, but have been slow to take action. For example, some places have included the promotion of improved varieties in their production increase measures, but they are still using ordinary seeds. Some plan to carry 200 loads of pond mud per mu, but in reality only carry 60 or 70 loads, a large difference. Some agricultural cooperatives plan to reach a yield of 400 jin per mu this year, but the production team's contracted output is only 220 jin, and all production increase measures are prepared according to 220 jin. Recently, there have been even more instances of false reporting: Yong'an Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, reported that it had accumulated more than 25 million jin of fertilizer, more than half of which had been sent out, and all seeds had been tested with good germination. After inspection, it was found that only more than 14 million jin of fertilizer had actually been accumulated, and the seeds had not been tested for germination at all. Some units, although they have set more advanced targets, have a somewhat perfunctory attitude. Their attitude is: if others order a thousand, I cannot order nine hundred. The plan is set like this first, whether it can be achieved will be discussed later. After the plan is set, they neither study specific measures nor plan to achieve it 100 percent, but just say it and forget about it. This is an important problem at present. If it is not solved immediately, the great leap forward plans in some places will fall through.

Through the hard work of last winter and this spring, all regions have achieved great results. The number of water conservancy projects and fertilizers alone has increased a lot. This will play a significant role in realizing this year's great leap forward in production. But things are interconnected. When one thing changes, many related things will inevitably change as well. Previously, there were enough water lifting tools, but now there are not enough, and there is a large shortage. In the past, uneven land was acceptable, but now, to irrigate, the land must be leveled. With the expansion of paddy fields, more paddy field seeds are needed. Water conservancy and fertilizer alone cannot solve the problem; intensive cultivation and full implementation of new agricultural technologies are also needed, which correspondingly increases the amount of labor. Leaders must anticipate this series of problems and actively find ways to solve them. However, some leading departments are satisfied with the existing achievements and have developed a blindly optimistic mood. They believe that after the efforts of winter and spring, the conditions for increasing production are already in place, and the plans for increasing production have been set, so everything is going well, and they have relaxed their efforts. Dafengbao Agricultural Cooperative in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, is a well-established cooperative. After the cooperative cadres built many water conservancy projects, accumulated a lot of fertilizer, and selected and retained a sufficient number of improved varieties, they believed that there were no problems in this year's production and could rest easy. It was not until a dispute arose in one of the production teams over the allocation of seeds that they woke up. Upon inspection, they discovered a series of problems that needed to be solved: due to the expansion of sweet potato planting area, the cooperative was short of more than 17,000 jin of sweet potato seeds; at the same time, it was found that although all the paddy fields in the cooperative were guaranteed irrigation, there were still more than 4,000 mu of dry land threatened by drought; due to the implementation of double plowing on all the fields this year, many plowshares were needed, and after calculation, there was still a shortage of more than 400; harrows, ropes, and plow buckles were also short by more than 1,000. Recently, Fushun County in Sichuan Province also inspected the production increase measures after the spring sowing work and found that some places had built good water conservancy projects and accumulated a lot of fertilizer, but they did not know how to use them rationally. These problems are often seen as "minor problems" and are not paid attention to. In fact, if these problems are not solved, the realization of the production increase plan is not guaranteed.

The thinking of some people is not fully adapted to the advanced targets, which is a new contradiction brought about by the great leap forward situation. The best way to solve this contradiction is to launch a major debate among the masses on the production increase plan through inspection and comparison, analyze the situation, find reliable ways to achieve the targets, and build the production increase plan on an active and reliable basis. Inspection and comparison can eliminate complacency among cadres and boost revolutionary drive; it can also open the eyes of the masses and further eliminate conservative thinking and the idea of relying on heaven for food. Xingyang Agricultural Cooperative in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, put forward the slogan of thousand-jin yield last spring, but because the production increase measures did not keep up, the average yield per mu was only 709 jin. This year, everyone was not ideologically prepared for the great leap forward and had no confidence in realizing the plan. The leadership then mobilized the masses to summarize and inspect last year's production, and as a result, found the specific causes of the problems. Later, they analyzed and studied this year's production conditions and measures in detail, and finally everyone felt that they should leap forward and could leap forward, so they set even higher targets than originally planned, and the members began to actively strive to realize this target. In less than five days, the amount of fertilizer increased from 380 loads per mu to 450 loads. In order to ensure the realization of the production increase plan, Datong County in Qinghai Province transmitted and discussed the seven production increase measures layer by layer among township and cooperative cadres and the masses, so that they took root and settled in the masses, which also achieved good results: the attendance rate of many agricultural cooperatives increased compared to before the discussion; previously, some areas had no habit of attending work at night, but now many members attend work at night; Jingyang Township originally only irrigated 20 mu of land in the spring, but after the discussion, it irrigated nearly 800 mu in four days.

Currently, various regions are inspecting spring plowing preparation work. Whether the production increase measures can meet the needs of the leap forward plan and whether they have been discussed by the masses and turned into mass action are the main problems in this year's spring plowing production and should be the focus of inspection.

    把增产计划变成群众的行动
    本报评论员
    计划今年达到“四、五、八”粮食指标的单位目前仍在不断出现。截至3月10日，全国已经有七百二十七个县市订了这样的计划。这是一个令人鼓舞的消息。
    计划是行动的指南，跃进的计划更能鼓舞群众的革命干劲。但是，要想实现计划，还必须有切实的增产措施，并且及时贯彻到农民群众中去，使之真正变成群众自己的奋斗目标，变成千百万群众的实际行动。
    有了切实措施的地区已经不少，那些地区的干部和群众正满怀信心地为实现计划而奋勇劳动。但是也有一些地方只是提出了先进的增产指标，却没有切实的措施。有的虽然也提出了一些有效的措施，但却迟迟地没有行动起来。比如，有些地方在增产措施中订的有推广良种一条，而实际使用的还是普通种子。有的计划每亩挑塘泥二百担，实际只有六、七十担，相差甚远。有的农业社计划今年达到亩产四百斤，而生产队的包产数只有二百二十斤，所有增产措施也都是按照二百二十斤准备的。最近更发现有虚报数字的现象：黑龙江省肇东县永安农业社向上汇报说已经积肥二千五百多万斤，一半以上已经送出，种子全部经过试验，发芽情况良好。经检查，实际上只积肥一千四百多万斤，种子根本没有经过发芽试验。有的单位虽然订出了较先进的指标，但有点勉强应付的味道。他们的态度是：别人订了一千，我也不能九百。计划先这样订了，能否实现将来再说。在计划订出以后，既不研究具体措施，也不打算百分之百实现，说过就算了。这是当前一个重要问题。如不立即解决，有些地方的跃进计划是会落空的。
    经过去冬今春的苦战，各地都取得了很大战果。单是水利工程和肥料就增加了很多。这对实现今年生产大跃进将起很大的作用。但事物是互相联系着的，一件事起了变化，很多有连带关系的事也必然随着发生变化。从前提水工具够用，现在不够用了，缺得很多。从前土地不平也可以，现在要浇水就必须平整土地。扩大了水田，就要增加水田种子。仅仅水利和肥料不能解决问题，还要精耕细作，全面贯彻新的农业技术，这个要求相应地增加劳动量。这一系列的问题，领导人都要预见到，都要积极设法解决。但是，有些领导部门却满足于已有的成绩，产生了盲目乐观的情绪。他们认为经过冬春的努力，增产条件已经具备，增产计划也订出来了，万事大吉，于是放松了努力。贵州遵义县大风暴农业社是一个基础较好的社，社干部们在修了很多水利工程、积了很多肥料、选留了足够数量的良种以后，便以为今年生产中已经没有问题，可以高枕无忧了。直到有的生产队因调剂种子发生了纠纷，他们才惊醒过来。一检查，发现了一系列必须解决的问题：由于扩大了甘薯种植面积，全社共缺薯种一万七千多斤；同时发现全社的水田虽然有了灌溉保证，但还有四千多亩旱地仍然受着旱灾的威胁；由于今年的田全部实行套犁，需要很多铧口，经过计算还差四百多个；耙索犁扣等也缺一千多根。四川省富顺县最近检查了春播工作以后的增产措施，也发现一些地方水利修得好，肥料积得多，但就不知道怎样合理运用。这些问题常被人们看成是“小问题”，不加注意。实际上这些问题如果不解决，增产计划的实现就是没有保证的。
    一部分人的思想情况同先进的指标不完全适应，这是大跃进形势带来的新矛盾。解决这个矛盾最好的办法，是通过检查评比，发动群众对增产计划进行一次大辩论，分析情况，找出实现指标的可靠办法，把增产计划建筑在积极可靠的基础上。检查评比可以消除干部中的自满情绪，鼓起革命干劲；也可以把群众的眼界打开，进一步消除保守思想和靠天吃饭思想。湖南平江县兴阳农业社去年春天提出了千斤丰产的口号，由于后来增产措施没跟上，结果平均亩产只有七百零九斤。今年大家对大跃进思想准备不足，对实现计划没有信心。领导上便发动群众总结检查去年的生产，结果找出了具体的病源。以后详细分析研究了今年的生产条件和措施，最后大家都感到应该跃进，也能够跃进，于是订出了比原订指标更高的指标，社员们开始积极为实现这个指标而努力。不到五天功夫，肥料就由原来每亩三百八十担增加到四百五十担。青海省大通县为了保证增产计划的实现，把七项增产措施在乡社干部和群众中层层传达和讨论，使之在群众中生根落脚，也收到了很好的效果：很多农业社出勤率都比讨论前提高了；以前有些晚上没有出勤习惯的地区现在也有很多社员晚上出勤了；景阳乡原来只春灌地二十亩，讨论后四天就灌了近八百亩。
    目前各地正在检查春耕准备工作。增产措施能否满足跃进计划的需要，是否经过群众讨论并变成群众的行动，是今年春耕生产中的主要问题，应该成为检查的重点。（附图片）
