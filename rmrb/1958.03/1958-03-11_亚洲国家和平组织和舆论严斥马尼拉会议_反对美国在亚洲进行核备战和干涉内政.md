Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Asian countries' peace organizations and public opinion strongly condemned the US attempt to promote new aggressive policies through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Manila conference and its conspiracy to establish atomic war bases in Asia and interfere in other countries' internal affairs.

    Vietnam Asian-African Solidarity Committee points out:
    The United States is stepping up its sabotage of the Geneva Accords
    The Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee issued a statement on the 8th, saying that the SEATO Council meeting convened by the United States runs counter to the ardent expectations of the Asian and African people for peace; at present, the Asian and African people hope that the Asian and African region will become a peaceful region without nuclear weapons and rockets.

    The statement pointed out that the continued transport of military materials and military personnel into South Vietnam, as well as preparations to pull South Vietnam into SEATO, clearly demonstrate that the United States is stepping up its conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords, prolong the division of Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into its colony and war base.

    The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace also issued a statement on the same day, saying that after establishing atomic bases in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, the United States is plotting to establish missile bases in some SEATO countries. This will exacerbate tensions in Asia and create a hotbed of atomic war in Asia.

    Jakarta newspapers issue warnings:
    No interference in Indonesian internal affairs
    Jakarta's "Dongxing Bao" published an editorial on the 10th, saying that the aggressive activities of SEATO have begun to threaten Indonesia's independence and its independent policy. The fact that the US Seventh Fleet has expanded its exercise area to the coast of Singapore shows that the focus of SEATO's activities is shifting southward. The newspaper pointed out that this exercise clearly shows that SEATO is a tool for interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries.

    "Indonesia Torch" published a commentary on the 10th, saying that Indonesia is a country that pursues an independent and peaceful coexistence policy. It does not want others to interfere in its internal affairs. The newspaper hopes that all SEATO member states will adopt a "non-interference" policy on Indonesian issues.

    Burmese Peace Committee calls on the people:
    Prevent the Manila Group from harming Burma
    The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on the 8th, saying that the purpose of the upcoming SEATO Manila Conference is undoubtedly to expand aggressive military activities and undermine the internal unity of Southeast Asian countries. This military bloc has always interfered in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries under the guise of "anti-communism."

    The statement called on the peace-loving people of Burma to pay close attention to the activities of SEATO and to prevent the conspiracy of this military bloc to harm Burma.
    "Manila Chronicle" columnist says Filipinos are indifferent to the Southeast Asia Group
    "Manila Chronicle" columnist Granada said in an article published in the newspaper on March 9: "Filipinos as a nation are indifferent to SEATO."

    He said: "(Filipino) people cannot take SEATO seriously because they cannot see where it will benefit them."

    Granada said that the Philippines needs to spend millions of pesos every year to maintain an army that is too large for this impoverished country. Filipinos cannot understand why they have to spend millions more pesos to participate in SEATO.

    亚洲国家和平组织和舆论严斥马尼拉会议
    反对美国在亚洲进行核备战和干涉内政
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国企图通过东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议推行新的侵略政策，在亚洲建立原子战争基地和干涉他国内政的阴谋，继续遭到亚洲国家的和平组织和舆论界的强烈谴责。
    越南亚非团结委员会指出
    美国正在加紧破坏日内瓦协议
    越南亚非人民团结委员会8日发表声明说，美国召开的东南亚条约组织理事会会议是同亚非人民对和平的热切期望背道而驰的；目前亚非人民希望亚非地区成为一个无核武器和火箭的和平地区。
    声明指出，继续不断地把军用物资和军事人员运入南越以及准备把南越拉入东南亚条约组织的行为，明显地证明美国正在变本加厉地阴谋破坏日内瓦协议，延长越南的分裂局面并且把越南南方变成它的殖民地和战争基地。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会在同一天也发表声明说，美国在日本、台湾和南朝鲜建立原子基地以后，阴谋在一些东南亚条约组织国家里建立导弹基地，这将要加剧亚洲的紧张局势，在亚洲造成原子战争的温床。
    雅加达报纸发出警告
    不许干涉印度尼西亚内政
    雅加达“东星报”10日发表社论说，东南亚条约组织的侵略性的活动已经开始威胁印度尼西亚的独立和它的独立政策。美国第七舰队把它的演习地区扩大到新加坡沿海一带这个事实表明，东南亚条约组织的活动焦点正在南移。报纸指出，这次演习明显地表明，东南亚条约组织是干涉东南亚国家内政的工具。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”10日发表评论说，印度尼西亚是一个奉行独立的、和平共处政策的国家。它不希望别人干涉它的内政。报纸希望所有东南亚条约组织的成员国对印度尼西亚的问题采取“不要干涉”的政策。
    缅甸和平委员会号召人民
    防止马尼拉集团危害缅甸
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会在8日发表声明说，即将举行的东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议的目的无疑是要扩展侵略性的军事活动和破坏东南亚国家的内部团结。这个军事集团一向以“防共”为名干涉东南亚国家的内政。
    声明要求爱好和平的缅甸人民时刻注意东南亚条约组织的活动，并且防止这个军事集团危害缅甸的阴谋。“马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家说菲律宾人对东南亚集团态度冷淡
    “马尼拉纪事报”专栏作家格拉纳达3月9日在这家报纸上发表的一篇文章里说：“菲律宾人作为一个民族对东南亚条约组织是冷淡的”。
    他说：“（菲律宾）人民无法认真对待东南亚条约组织，因为他们看不出它会在什么地方对他们有利。”
    格拉纳达说，菲律宾每年需要花费千百万比索，来维持一支对这个贫困的国家来说过于庞大的军队。菲律宾人不能了解，他们为什么还得再花千百万比索来参加东南亚条约组织。
