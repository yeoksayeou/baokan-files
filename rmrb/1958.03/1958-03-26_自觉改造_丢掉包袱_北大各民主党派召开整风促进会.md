    Consciously Remold Oneself, Shed the Burden
    Peking University's Democratic Parties Hold Rectification Promotion Meeting

    (Our Newspaper News) On the night of the 24th, the heads of the democratic parties at Peking University held a joint meeting to discuss how to cooperate with the "Two-Anti" movement to carry out rectification within the democratic parties.

    At the meeting, Professor Chu Sheng-lin, chairman of the China Democratic League's Peking University branch, spoke on behalf of the democratic parties at Peking University. He said: The content of the general rectification within the democratic parties is somewhat different from the focus of the Communist Party's rectification. As far as Peking University is concerned, the vast majority of members of the democratic parties have not yet escaped the intermediate state politically. Therefore, the main content of the rectification is to rectify the political stance. Most of the democratic party members in the school are professors and cadres holding administrative leadership positions, who play a very important role in running a socialist university that is both red and expert. If the political stance is unstable, wavering, and not wholeheartedly devoted to socialism, but rather half-hearted, how can one become a people's teacher who is both red and expert? Therefore, the fundamental transformation of the political stance is an urgent matter for each of our members. After explaining that this rectification is different from the anti-Rightist struggle, he called on those who had published rightist remarks or had unclear relationships with rightists during the period of great blooming and contending last year to take the initiative to expose and criticize their own erroneous words and deeds, to correct their own mistakes, to shed the burden on their backs, and to make a great leap forward toward the road of being both red and expert together with everyone. He asked non-Party masses to help the democratic parties at Peking University to carry out rectification. He believes that the current favorable conditions of the school's "Two-Anti" movement should be used to strike while the iron is hot and catch up.

    Comrade Lu Ping, First Secretary of the Peking University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, then delivered a speech. He said that the democratic parties' rectification is being carried out under very favorable circumstances, and the Party at Peking University will provide all necessary assistance.

    At the meeting, sixteen people read out their big-character posters, setting fire to themselves. Professor Xing Qiyi, a member of the China Democratic League, exposed his erroneous views on the policies of the Soviet Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party regarding science and higher education, as well as on activists and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, in his big-character poster "Exposing My Reactionary Thoughts and Reactionary Stance." He said, "Now that I have shed the burden, I will move forward easily and happily tomorrow." Professor Wen Jiasi checked some of his erroneous remarks on the "school Party committee system" that he made during the blooming and contending last year in his big-character poster "Confiding in the Party" and resolved to thoroughly transform his stance. Zhou Peiyuan, chairman of the Peking University branch of the Jiusan Society and vice president of Peking University, reviewed in his big-character poster "Setting Fire to Myself, Confiding in the Party" that he still had strong bourgeois old democratic ideas on the leadership of higher education institutions. He had proposed the idea of "democratic school management" last year. He finally stated: "I am determined to burn all the bourgeois ideas on my body clean and strive to be a proletarian intellectual who is both red and expert." Professor You Guoen, deputy chairman of the Peking University branch of the Jiusan Society, reviewed in his big-character poster that he only taught books but not people in the past, only asked about business but not about politics, which resulted in ten rightists among the thirteen young cadres in the Literary History Teaching and Research Section. Zhang Tingqian, associate professor and chairman of the Peking University branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, called on the members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy in his big-character poster to "quickly shed the burden and embark on the road of being both red and expert together, and take action immediately." Professor Deng Guangming, a member of the China Democratic League, also expressed his determination to be a firm leftist and Marxist historian with a big-character poster. He said that he had jumped out of the "ivory tower" and actively devoted himself to the "Two-Anti" movement. He had challenged the teachers of the Teaching and Research Section: starting from the present, immediately turn to the left, and immediately start walking!

    自觉改造　丢掉包袱
    北大各民主党派召开整风促进会
    本报讯　24日深夜，北京大学各民主党派负责人召开联席会，讨论如何配合双反运动开展民主党派内部的整风问题。
    会上，民盟北京大学支部主任委员褚圣麟教授代表北京大学各民主党派讲了话。他说：民主党派内部一般整风的内容和共产党的整风重点有所不同。就北大来说，各民主党派的绝大多数成员在政治上还没有摆脱中间状态，因此整风的主要内容是整政治立场。学校里的民主党派成员大多数是教授和担任行政领导工作的干部，在办好又红又专的社会主义大学中起着十分重要的作用。如果政治立场不稳，动摇不定，对社会主义还不是一心一意，而是三心二意，这怎么能够使自己成为一个又红又专的人民教师呢？因此政治立场的根本改造，对我们每一个成员来说，是迫不容缓的事情。他在说明了这次整风与反右斗争不同之后，号召那些去年在大鸣大放期间，发表过右派言论或者与右派关系曚昧不清的人，自己起来主动揭发和批判自己的错误言行，自己起来改正自己的错误，把压在身上的包袱丢掉，和大家一道向又红又专的道路大跃进。他要求党外群众帮助北大的各民主党派整风。他认为目前应利用学校的双反运动的有利条件，趁热打铁，迎头赶上。
    中共北大委员会第一书记陆平同志接着致词。他说，民主党派整风是在非常有利的形势下进行的，北大的党将给予一切应有的协助。
    会上十六人宣读了自己的大字报，纷纷引火烧身。民盟盟员邢其毅教授在“暴露我的反动思想和反动立场”的大字报中，暴露了他对苏联共产党、中国共产党关于科学和高等教育方面的政策，以及对积极分子、对肃反的错误看法。他说：“我现在丢了包袱，明天就会轻松愉快的前进。”闻家驷教授在“向党交心”的大字报中检查了自己去年鸣放时对“学校党委制”问题发表的一些错误言论，并决心彻底改造立场。九三学社北大支社主任委员、北大副校长周培源在“引火烧身，向党交心”的大字报中，检查了自己对高等学校的领导问题上，还存在着浓厚的资产阶级旧民主的思想。他去年曾提出“民主办校”的说法。他最后表示：“有决心把我身上的一切资产阶级思想烧得干干净净，争取做一个又红又专的无产阶级知识分子。”九三学社北大支社副主任委员游国恩教授在大字报中检查了自己过去教书不教人，只问业务，不问政治，致使文学史教研室十三个青年干部中竟出现了十个右派分子。北大民进支部主委章廷谦副教授在大字报中号召民进会员“赶快丢掉包袱，一齐走上又红又专的道路，立刻行动起来。”民盟盟员邓广铭教授也用大字报表示了要作坚定的左派和马克思主义历史学者的决心。他说，他已经跳出“象牙之塔”，积极投身到“双反”运动中，他曾向教研室的教师们挑战：从当时当地开始，立即向左转，立即开步走！
