Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 14th: Antara News Agency's war correspondent reported from Central Sumatra that the recent battle in which government forces retook Pekanbaru was the largest battle in Indonesian history involving airborne troops. The airborne forces included two battalions of paratroopers, as well as attached signal and engineering corps, plus equipment and food. They all landed within eight hours. More than three companies of rebels collapsed or surrendered en masse under the offensive of the government forces, which suffered no casualties.

The Antara News Agency reporter said that because the government troops took swift action that caught the rebels by surprise, they did not have time to remove the foreign weapons that foreign aircraft had airdropped to them just hours before.

    北干巴鲁战役迅速解决
    叛军措手不及纷纷瓦解或投降
    据新华社雅加达14日电　据安塔拉通讯社战地记者从中苏门答腊报道，政府军最近收复北干巴鲁的战役是印度尼西亚有史以来规模最大的有空降兵部队参加的战役，空降的兵力包括两营空降兵以及附属的通讯兵和工兵，另外还有装备和食物，他们在八小时之内全部着陆。三连多叛军在政府军的攻势下纷纷瓦解或者投降，政府军没有伤亡。
    安塔拉通讯社记者说，由于政府军队采取了出乎叛乱分子意料的迅速行动，他们来不及运走就在几小时之前外国飞机给他们空投下来的外国武器。
