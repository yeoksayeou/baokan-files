Old hero Xue Huiyi

Xue Huiyi is an old hero in the Four Pests campaign. In two years and eight months, he eliminated more than 1,900 rats and 2,700 sparrows. Last year, he used fly traps to kill more than 430,000 flies.

He used his spare time to create more than ten kinds of tools for eliminating the Four Pests, such as the "horsetail bow rat trap," "wooden ring iron cone rat trap," "rice field rat net," "sparrow-shooting gun," and "fly trap." Every night, he distributed various rat traps in places where rats appeared; during the day when he went to the fields, he carried a "sparrow-shooting gun" and a "wooden ring iron cone rat trap" to eliminate sparrows and field mice. Now, Dongjiazhuang Village in Jishan County, Shanxi, where Xue Huiyi is located, has basically achieved "Four Nos."

    老英雄薛回义
    薛回义是一个除四害老英雄。在两年八个月中，他消灭了老鼠一千九百多只，麻雀两千七百只。去年他用灭蝇罩消灭苍蝇四十三万多个。
    他利用业余时间创造了“马尾吊弓捕鼠器”、“木圈铁锥捕鼠器”、“捕禾鼠网”、“打麻雀枪”、“灭蝇罩”等十多种除四害工具。每当夜晚，他把各种捕鼠器分布在老鼠出没的地方；白天上地，便携带“打麻雀枪”和“木圈铁锥捕鼠器”，消灭麻雀和禾鼠。现在，薛回义所在的山西稷山县董家庄已经基本实现“四无”。
