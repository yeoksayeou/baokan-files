    Agricultural Cooperative Members Create Automatic Water Pump
    Shi Yuchun, a member of the Bagongqiao Iron Industry Cooperative in Puyang County, Henan Province, successfully trial-produced an "automatic irrigation suction pipe."
    In order to support water conservancy construction, Shi Yuchun worked tirelessly, racking his brains and finding ways to create tools in his spare time. He used the principles of atmospheric pressure and vacuum to trial-produce a small model. After several successful tests, he began to trial-produce iron suction pipes, with good results. Its efficiency is equivalent to six Liberation-style water wheels, and the cost, including labor and materials, is only over 40 yuan.

    农业社员创造自动抽水器
    河南省濮阳县八公桥铁业社社员史玉春试制“自动灌溉吸水管”成功。
    史玉春为了支持水利建设，废寝忘食地利用业余时间动脑筋、想办法来创制工具。他利用大气压力与真空的原理，试制了一个小模型，经几次试验成功后，开始试制铁的吸水管，效果良好。它的效能相当于解放式水车六部，造价连工带料只用四十多元。
