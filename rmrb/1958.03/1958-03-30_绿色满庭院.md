    A Courtyard Full of Greenery
    Ding Jun

    How pleasant it would be if our courtyard were full of green shade and flowers and fruits from early spring to late autumn. Around Qingming, it is a good time for us to plant flowers and trees. Let's plant some trees in the yard in a planned way!

    In order to be both beautiful and economically valuable, in the space in the yard, you can plant a few fruit trees that can both be admired for their flowers and harvested for their fruits, such as peaches, apricots, pears, apples, crabapples, persimmons, etc. In the spring, peach and plum blossoms bloom, butterflies fly around, and bees come and go to collect honey...; when the fruits are about to ripen, clusters of lush green branches are covered with red or yellow fruits, which are even more attractive. When the fruits are ripe, the whole family sits around the fruit tree, eating the fruits that they have cultivated with their own hands, which will be especially sweet.

    If the yard is relatively spacious, you can plant a grape trellis in the center, using bamboo poles or wooden bars to build a pergola. In the summer, at night, the whole family gathers under the pergola, fanning themselves and enjoying the cool, watching the fireflies emit star-like fluorescent light. What a poetic night scene!

    Around the edges of the yard, or under the eaves in front of the windows, you can also plant some herbaceous plants that have both flowers to see and fruits to taste. For example, sunflowers, which can bloom with a bright yellow large flower head in the summer. In the autumn, it bears countless sunflower seeds. You can also plant some daylilies. In the spring, daylilies bloom with bright yellow beautiful flowers; in the summer and autumn, the lush green clumps are also very elegant. When its flowers are still buds, pick them, dry them and store them, and they are our favorite dried lily flowers.

    In order to prevent the soil surface in the yard from being exposed and to make more use of the land, you can also lay a layer of turf in the empty spaces between the flowers and trees. In the past, northern China mostly used sheep fescue as turf, but it was not ideal, and it would appear brittle when it was dry. In this case, you can use chives instead of turf, and it can also be used as a vegetable. If you cut the chives once every five or six inches, you can keep them short like turf, and they will taste fragrant and tender. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone? In the hot summer, you can also let it bloom once, a patch of small white flower balls, not only beautiful, but if you pick the flowers, mash them and add some salt, store them, and they will become a favorite side dish in autumn and winter - chive flowers.

    绿色满庭院
    丁君
    在我们住的庭院里，如果从早春到深秋，都是绿荫复地，花果满园，该是多么惬意的事情。清明前后，正是我们栽花植树的好时节，让我们来有计划地在院子里种些树吧！
    为了能美化而又有经济价值，在院子空间的地方，可以栽植几棵既能赏花又能结果的果树，像桃子、杏子、梨、苹果、海棠、柿子等。春天，桃李盛开，蝴蝶飞来舞去，蜜蜂往来采蜜……；当果子即将成熟的时候，一丛丛浓绿色的树枝上，累累红色或黄色的果子，更逗人喜爱。果实成熟，全家围坐在果树下，吃着自己亲手栽培得来的果子，当会分外香甜。
    如果院子比较宽敞，在中心可以栽植一架葡萄，用竹杆或木杠搭成一个凉棚。夏季，夜晚，全家围聚棚下，挥扇乘凉，看点点萤火虫，发出星星般的萤光，这又是一个多么富有诗意的夜景呵！
    在院子的四周边缘地方，或者是窗前檐下，还可以栽种一些既有花可看又有果可尝的草本植物。例如向日葵，在夏天能开出一个鲜黄色的大花盘。到了秋天，它又结出无数葵瓜子。另外还可以种上一些萱草。春天，萱草开出鲜黄色的美丽花朵；夏秋，绿油油的株丛也非常雅致。当它的花在含苞未放的时候，采下来晒干收藏，就是我们最喜欢吃的黄花菜。
    为了不使院中暴露土面，并且更多的利用地力，还可以在花木之间空余的地方，铺上一层草皮。以前北方多选用羊胡草作草皮，但是并不理想，它在干旱的时候，就会显得焦脆。在这种情况下，可以选用韭菜代替草皮，并且还可以作蔬菜。如果每当韭菜长到五、六寸时就割一次，既能让它矮矮地像草皮，而且吃起来又香又嫩，岂不一举两得？当炎热的夏天，还可以让它开一次花，一片白色的小花球，不但美丽，如果把花采下来，捣碎加上一些盐，贮藏起来，就成为秋冬人们所喜欢吃的小菜——韭菜花。
