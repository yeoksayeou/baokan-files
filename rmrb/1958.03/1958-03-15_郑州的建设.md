Zhengzhou's Construction
By our reporter Fan Rongkang

A Fresh New Look

More than eight years ago, I had a brief encounter with Zhengzhou while following the Liu-Deng army to liberate the Southwest. This time, I came to Zhengzhou with the feeling of "revisiting an old place." Unexpectedly, Zhengzhou's construction has developed so rapidly that many "old Zhengzhou residents" feel like they are in a foreign land when they return here. As a mere passerby who only had one previous encounter, I can hardly recognize its original appearance.

Zhengzhou, a city with more than three thousand years of history, became famous in modern times as a transportation hub connecting north, south, east and west with the completion of the Beijing-Guangzhou and Longhai Railways. Although it has a long history, Zhengzhou was just a small county town with a population of 150,000 and an area of just over five square kilometers at the time of liberation. All the roads in the city were dirt roads, and only a short 700-meter-long section of Datong Road was paved with concrete. Counting all the streets and alleys, there were only forty-four dim streetlights. Henan cotton is famous, and Zhengzhou is the distribution center for cotton from Shaanxi, Hebei, and Henan, but at the time of liberation, Zhengzhou was a city without a single spindle, leaving behind only the ruins of the Yu Feng Yarn Factory in a corner of the city. Henan tobacco leaves are also famous, but Zhengzhou only had a small cigarette factory with one cigarette-making machine. The Zhengzhou Power Plant was even more pitiful, with only one small 15-kilowatt generator. Comrades from the Municipal Planning Commission said that at the time of liberation, we only took over five small factories with more than four hundred employees.

What does Zhengzhou look like now? The urban area has expanded to 39 square kilometers, an increase of seven times compared to the time of liberation. The new construction area is 4,030,000 square meters, an increase of nearly three times compared to the time of liberation. The urban population is 450,000, and the total population including the suburbs is 770,000. During the First Five-Year Plan period, 28 new modern factories were built, and 22 have been completed and put into production. Factories line the newly built Jianshe Road. In the western suburbs of the city, five state-owned cotton textile factories are arranged in a line. Together with the State-owned Cotton Factory No. 2 built on the site of the Yu Feng Yarn Factory, the city now has more than 400,000 spindles. The total industrial output value in 1957 was 110 times that of 1948, and the number of employees was 14 times that of 1948. Zhengzhou is now the largest industrial city in Henan. The appearance of Zhengzhou has also changed greatly. The newly built asphalt and concrete roads are 82 kilometers long, and the sewer system is nearly 200 kilometers long. Tap water became available in 1953, and bus routes were opened. The former stinking Jingshui River has been transformed into the wide and flat Jiefang Road. At night, the whole city is brightly lit, no longer the pitiful sight of forty-four streetlights in the past.

When you come to Zhengzhou, you cannot help but feel proud of the vigorous development of the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

Large but Inefficient

However, while touring the entire city of Zhengzhou, while rejoicing in the vigorous development of the construction cause, one cannot help but feel a deep regret: the city's planning is too large, and the urban area is stretched too far. I took a pedicab from Zhengzhou Railway Station in the old city area to the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government area, which was a long journey and took a lot of time. From the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government area to the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government area, it was in another direction, crossing the railway line and taking even longer. Returning to the old city area from the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government area was another long journey. These three areas happen to form a triangle, which is too far apart and very inconvenient to travel between.

According to Comrade Cheng Ren, director of the Zhengzhou Municipal Urban Construction Committee, Zhengzhou's urban planning does indeed seem to be too large now, resulting in a lot of waste. In recent years, a total of 64,100 mu of land have been requisitioned, much of which was requisitioned excessively or prematurely. The average building density in the city is only 21%, which is lower than the central government's quota. Comrade Cheng Ren said that, considered separately, the construction land for factories is relatively economical, and the layout is also relatively reasonable when considering Zhengzhou's geological conditions, transportation situation, and development prospects. The waste is relatively large in the construction of office buildings and schools. Indeed, there are particularly many newly built office buildings here, with almost every office and bureau occupying a three- or four-story building. Although the designs are relatively beautiful and the construction costs are relatively low, the building area is too large. Every institution requires its own office building and dormitory building to be connected, forming a circle, so they are either not square or rectangular, making it difficult to insert other buildings and preventing full use of the land area. The waste in school construction is mainly due to the excessive land occupied by sports fields. In recent years, Zhengzhou has built four universities, twenty-five secondary technical schools, and nineteen provincial-level cadre schools. These schools have basketball courts and volleyball courts, but most also require a 400-meter-long track. It is said that not having their own track would "affect physical education exercises." A 400-meter-long track is equivalent to about 30 mu of land. Some people have suggested that several neighboring schools share a track, but no one is willing to cooperate. As a result, a large amount of land has been wasted.

Excessive land occupation is one aspect of the waste caused by overly ambitious urban planning; another aspect of waste is that it has forced the expansion of municipal construction and public welfare facilities, increasing engineering costs and making it inconvenient for people to live. The vastness of Zhengzhou's road and sewer projects is largely due to the excessive expansion of the urban area. In recent years, more than 60,000 square meters of commercial service facilities have been built in the new urban area of Zhengzhou. On the one hand, the distribution was not well considered in these constructions, and investments were concentrated in some areas, resulting in the construction of seven larger markets. On the other hand, it is also because the urban area is too large to be properly served. Now, life in the new urban area is far less convenient than in the old urban area, and in some places, people have to travel a kilometer to buy some vegetables.

These wasteful phenomena in Zhengzhou's urban planning and urban construction should be analyzed from a historical perspective. Zhengzhou's original urban foundation was very weak. In recent years, industrial construction and cultural and educational undertakings have developed rapidly, and the Henan Provincial People's Committee has also moved here from Kaifeng, leading to a sharp increase in population. Therefore, it is inevitable that the proportion of urban area expansion and building area growth exceeds that of many other cities. As for the waste within this growth, some could certainly have been avoided. Due to a lack of the idea of building the country diligently and thriftily, the waste could not be avoided. But much of it was unavoidable. Who had experience in urban planning in the past? Who could pat their chest and say, "Let me do it and I will definitely not make mistakes?"

Filling the Gaps and Consolidating

Past shortcomings should not be overly criticized, but how to earnestly implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily in the future is a matter that should be strictly demanded.

The relevant departments in Zhengzhou, under the leadership of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, have already done a lot of work in this regard. In the past period, more than 5,000 mu of prematurely or excessively requisitioned land have been returned to farmers for cultivation. The Zhengzhou Municipal Urban Construction Committee has recently completed a "Near-Term Planning Control Development Scope Map." Comrade Cheng Ren explained that, according to this control map, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, Zhengzhou's new construction projects can basically be laid out within the existing urban area, without further expansion outwards. By filling in the gaps and consolidating, 1.2 million square meters of new buildings can be placed between existing blocks. In this way, basic construction land and municipal construction investment can be greatly saved. Not long ago, they further completed a specific plan for filling the gaps and consolidating some blocks. A meeting has been held to solicit opinions from various parties. They will strive to complete all the planning for filling the gaps and consolidating other blocks within this year. After the vacant land in the city is filled, Zhengzhou's buildings will not be disorganized, but rather more compact and the city's appearance will be more spectacular.

Of course, if Zhengzhou's basic construction tasks during the Second Five-Year Plan period are much larger than currently estimated, this "Near-Term Planning Control Development Scope Map" will probably still be broken through. However, with the idea of thrift and the idea of building the country diligently and thriftily, even if this control map is to be broken through, people can believe that Zhengzhou's construction will continue to develop along the path of diligence and thrift.

    郑州的建设
    本报记者　范荣康
    面貌一新
    八年多以前，随刘邓大军解放西南，曾同郑州有一面之缘。这次，原是抱着“旧地重游”的心情来到郑州的。不料郑州的建设竟发展得这样快，许多“老郑州”回到这里都有置身异乡之感，我这仅有一面之交的路人，更是认不出它本来的面目了。
    郑州这个城市，已有三千多年的历史。近代郑州是以京广铁路和陇海铁路建成，变为东西南北的交通要道而出名的。虽然年代很久了，但到解放时，郑州只是个十五万人口、占地五平方公里多的小县城。全城都是土路，只有一条短短七百公尺的大同路铺着水泥路面。数遍大街小巷，只有四十四盏半暗半明的路灯。河南棉花是著名的，郑州更是陕、冀、豫一带棉花的集散地，但到解放的时候，郑州还是一个没有一枚纱锭的城市，市区一角空留着一个豫丰纱厂的遗址。河南烟叶也是著名的，但郑州只有一个拥有一部卷烟机的小烟厂。郑州电厂更可怜到只有一部十五瓩的小发电机。市计划委员会的同志们说，解放的时候，我们接收下来的，只有五个小工厂，四百多名职工。
    现在的郑州建设成什么样子了呢？市区面积已扩大到三十九平方公里，较解放时增加了七倍。新的建筑面积达四百零三万平方公尺，较解放时增加了近三倍。市区人口四十五万人，连同郊区已达七十七万人。第一个五年计划期间新建的现代化工厂就有二十八个，已建成投入生产的有二十二个。新建成的建设路旁，工厂林立。在市区的西郊，五个国营棉纺织厂一字形排开，加上在豫丰纱厂原址建设起来的国棉二厂，全市已有四十多万纱锭。1957年的工业总产值为1948年的一百一十倍，职工人数为1948年的十四倍。郑州，现在已经是河南最大的工业城市了。郑州市容也随之大为改观。新建的柏油路面和水泥路面长达八十二公里，上下水道近二百公里长。1953年起有了自来水，开辟了公共汽车线路。旧日一泓臭水的金水河故道，建成了宽广平坦的解放路。入夜，全城灯火通明，再不是过去四十四盏路灯的凄苦模样了。
    来到郑州，你不能不为祖国社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展而感到骄傲。
    大而不当
    然而，游历郑州全市，在为建设事业蓬勃发展欢欣鼓舞的同时，也不能不感到深深的遗憾：这个城市的规划搞得太大了，市区的面积拉得太广了。我从设在旧市区的郑州车站坐三轮车去省委和省府区域，路程遥远，很费了一番时间。从省委和省府区域再去市委和市府区域，又在另一个方向，几越铁路线费时更久。从市委和市府区域重回旧市区，又是一段漫长的路程。这三个地区恰巧构成一个三角形，距离太远，来往很不方便。
    据郑州市城市建设委员会主任程壬同志说，郑州市的城市规划，现在看来确实是搞大了，因而造成很多浪费。这些年来征用的土地共六万四千一百亩，其中有很多是多征、早征了的。全市建筑密度平均只达到21％，低于中央的定额。程壬同志说，分别地来看，工厂的建设用地比较节省，同时从郑州市的地质情况、交通情况和发展前途来考虑，摆布得也是比较合理的。浪费比较大的，是办公楼和学校的建筑。确实，这里新建的办公楼特别多，几乎一个厅，一个局就是一幢三、四层的大楼。虽然设计都比较美观，造价也比较低，但建筑面积太大。各个机关都要求把自己的办公楼、宿舍楼连在一起，划成一个圈圈，因而不是正方形的，就是长方形的，别的建筑很难插进去，土地面积不能充分使用。学校建筑的浪费，主要是运动场占用的土地太多。这些年来，郑州市新建了四个大学，二十五个中等技术学校，十九个省级干部学校。这些学校有篮球场、排球场，但大都还要求一个四百公尺长的跑道。据说自己没有跑道，就“影响劳卫制锻炼”。四百公尺长的跑道，约等于三十亩土地。有人建议邻近的几个学校合用一个跑道，但谁也不愿意合作。结果，浪费了大批土地。
    占用土地过多，是城市规划偏大造成浪费的一个方面；另一个方面的浪费是，逼得市政建设、公共福利设施的建设加大了工程量，多用了钱，而且人们住着还很不方便。郑州市道路工程和上下水道工程的浩大，很大一部分就是由于市区面积扩展太大造成的。这些年来，在郑州市的新市区，共建设了六万多平方公尺商业服务设施。一方面固然是在这些建设中没有很好地考虑合理分布，投资集中了一些，盖了七个较大的市场，另一方面也是由于市区面积过大，照应不过来，现在新市区人们的生活远没有旧市区方便，有些地方买点蔬菜也要跑一公里路。
    对于郑州市城市规划和城市建设中的这些浪费现象，应该用历史的观点去分析。郑州市原有的城市基础很薄弱，这几年来工业建设和文教事业发展很快，河南省人民委员会也从开封迁到这里来，人口激增，因而市区面积扩大的比例和建筑面积增长的比例超过许多城市，这是必然的。至于其中的浪费，有些固然是可以避免的，由于缺乏勤俭建国的思想，未能避免，造成浪费；但也有许多是难以避免的。搞城市规划，过去谁有这方面的经验？谁能拍拍胸脯说：“让我来搞就绝对不犯错误”？
    填空补实
    过去工作中的缺点，不可深责；但在今后如何认真贯彻勤俭建国的方针，却是应该严格要求的。
    郑州市的有关部门，在中共河南省委会的领导下，已经在这方面做了许多工作。过去一个时期，已有五千多亩早征、多征的土地发还给农民耕种。郑州市城市建设委员会新近完成了一张“近期规划控制发展范围图”。程壬同志解释说：根据这张控制图，第二个五年计划期间，郑州市新的建设工程，基本上可以在现有市区的范围内摆开，不再向外发展。用填空补实的办法，现有街坊之间，可以摆进一百二十万平方公尺的新建筑。这样，基本建设用地和市政建设投资都可以大大节省。不久以前，他们又进一步完成了一部分街坊填空补实的具体规划。已开了一次会，征求各方面的意见。今年内还要争取把其他街坊的填空补实规划全部完成。全市的空地填实起来之后，郑州的建筑不是零乱了，而是可以更紧凑些，市容更壮观些。
    当然，如果第二个五年计划期间郑州市的基本建设任务比现在预计的大得多，这份“近期规划控制发展范围图”恐怕还是会被突破的。但是，有了节约的思想，有了勤俭建国的思想，即便这份控制图要被突破，人们可以相信，郑州市的建设仍将沿着勤俭的道路发展。
