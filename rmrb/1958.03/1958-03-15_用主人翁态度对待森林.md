Treat Forests with a Master's Attitude
Commentator of This Newspaper

    In order to accelerate the greening of barren mountains and wastelands and expand China's forest area, we need to plant trees on a large scale and protect existing forests. In recent years, most parts of the country have relied on cooperatives to carry out forest fire-free campaigns, which have yielded great results. Forest fires have been greatly reduced in many areas. In 1957, eleven provinces, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shaanxi, Fujian, and Sichuan, had 155 forest fire-free counties and 12,215 forest fire-free townships. However, as reported in today's newspaper, there are still many areas where forest fire prevention is poorly done, resulting in frequent forest fires, with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of acres of forest being destroyed by wildfires. This is so heartbreaking! China's forest area is already very small. Everyone is doing their best to plant trees, fearing that it will not meet the needs of national economic construction and people's lives. How can we tolerate large areas of forest being burned down?

    Some people are indifferent to such a serious matter as a large number of forests being burned down. In their view, forest fires have always occurred every year and cannot be eliminated at all, so why make a fuss? Now, 155 forest fire-free counties have emerged. I wonder how they will explain this! Facts have proved that most wildfires are not naturally occurring but are caused by humans. People often cause fires when they burn land for reclamation or set fire to burn grass to accumulate fertilizer due to carelessness. If people pay close attention to fire prevention, they can prevent fires. Here, the decisive factor is the attitude people take towards forest resources. In the old society, the exploiting classes always plundered all natural and man-made resources by any means and regardless of the consequences. In the era when the people have become masters of the land, there are still some people who have not washed away the toxins of the old era and arbitrarily destroy forest resources and natural resources, or see this phenomenon and do not stop it, which is extremely inconsistent with the identity of the masters. Some county and township leaders do not earnestly mobilize the masses to do a good job in forest protection and fire prevention. Some staff members do not even urgently organize the masses to put out the fire when a wildfire occurs. The reason is that they do not really regard the forest as the wealth of the country and the people. They lack the basic sense of responsibility for protecting forests. To eliminate forest fires, the first thing that is needed is for leaders at all levels to change this wrong attitude. When the leaders' attitude is correct and their sense of responsibility is enhanced, they can regularly educate the masses and make them cherish forest resources with the attitude of masters. The party and government leading organs of Guangning County in Guangdong Province and Huanglong County in Shaanxi Province have included forest protection and fire prevention on their important agenda. When mountain fires occurred, the county party secretary and the county head personally led the masses to fight the fire on the mountain. Cadres who went to the countryside took on forest protection and fire prevention tasks, carried out extensive publicity among the masses, and actively promoted it. Therefore, both counties eliminated forest fires.

    Some comrades take a one-sided attitude towards the contradiction between forest protection and fire prevention and agricultural production. They have never seriously solved the problem of production-related fires, which often cause fires. It is understood that fires caused by production account for 70 to 80 percent of all forest fires. Now, the spring plowing is about to begin, and there will be many production activities in mountainous areas this year, and the use of fire in production may increase. In this case, how to prevent forest fires requires more research, organizing mass discussions, and relying on the masses to formulate various systems and measures. For various sources of fire, those that can be changed should be resolutely advocated to change; those that should be prohibited should be resolutely prohibited; those that temporarily need to be used should be strictly controlled. As the saying goes, "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, and nourish the mountain by eating the mountain." Forest protection and production can be completely combined. In the past, some places, regardless of the specific circumstances, generally prohibited the masses from entering the mountains to engage in sideline production during the season when mountain fires were prone to occur. This was wrong. The active approach should be to strengthen organizational leadership, fully mobilize the masses, and enable the masses to consciously abide by the fire prevention system and protect the forest when they enter the mountains for production.

    The work of planting trees and afforestation is making great strides forward, and the work of forest protection should also make great strides forward. Now, the movement for forest fire-free areas should be widely and deeply carried out in all mountainous areas across the country. All counties, townships, and communities can carry out evaluations and competitions to ensure the safety of forests and accelerate the greening of barren mountains and wastelands!

    用主人翁态度对待森林
    本报评论员
    为了加速绿化荒山荒地，扩大我国森林面积，一方面需要大规模地植树造林，一方面需要把现有的森林保护好。近年来，全国大部分地区依靠合作社开展了森林无火灾运动，收到了很大的效果。很多地区森林火灾大大减少了。1957年仅黑龙江、吉林、陕西、福建、四川等十一个省就出现了一百五十五个无森林火灾县、一万二千二百一十五个无森林火灾乡。但是，如像今天本报所报道的，还有不少地区在护林防火方面做得很不好，以致森林火灾频繁发生，动不动就是几万亩、几十万亩森林被山火烧毁。这是多么令人痛心的事！我国的森林面积本来就很小，大家尽最大努力来植树造林，犹恐不能满足国家经济建设和人民生活的需要，怎能容忍大片大片的森林被烧毁呢？
    有些人对于大量森林被火烧掉这样严重的事情无动于衷。在他们看来，森林火灾从来就是年年发生，根本无法消灭，何必大惊小怪？现在，一百五十五个无森林火灾县出现了，不知他们怎样解释！事实证明，绝大部分山火不是自然发生的，而是人为地造成的。人们在山上放火烧垦，点火烧草积肥，由于不谨慎，就常常造成火灾。如果人们严密地注意防火，也就能够防止火灾。在这里，决定的因素是人们用什么态度对待森林资源。在旧社会，剥削阶级总是不择手段，不计后果地掠夺一切自然的和人工创造的资源；在人民做了土地主人的时代，还有一部分人没有洗清旧时代的遗毒，任意破坏森林资源和自然资源，或者看到这种现象而不加以制止，这是和主人翁的身份极不相称的。有些县、乡的领导人员不去认真发动群众做好护林防火工作。有些工作人员甚至在发生山火的时候也不去紧急组织群众扑灭火灾。原因就是他们没有真正把森林看成是国家和人民的财富。他们对于保护森林缺乏起码的责任心。要消灭森林火灾，首先必需各级领导人员改变这种错误态度。领导者态度端正了，责任心增强了，才能经常教育群众，使他们用主人翁态度来爱护森林资源。广东省广宁县和陕西省黄龙县党政领导机关把护林防火列入重要议事日程。山火发生时县委书记和县长都亲自带领群众上山打火。干部下乡都带护林防火任务，在群众中普遍宣传，积极推动。所以这两个县都消灭了森林火灾。
    有些同志用片面的态度来对待护林防火和农业生产之间的矛盾。对于经常引起火灾的生产用火的问题，始终不去认真地解决。据了解，由于生产引起的火灾占全部森林火灾的十分之七、八。现在，春耕快开始了，今年山区生产活动很多，生产用火可能增加。在这种情况下如何防止森林火灾，更加需要好好研究，组织群众讨论，依靠群众制订各种制度和措施。对于各种火源，能够改变的坚决提倡改变；应该禁止的坚决禁止；暂时必需用火的严加控制。俗话说：“靠山吃山，吃山养山。”护林和生产完全可以结合。过去有些地方在容易发生山火的季节，不顾具体情况，一概禁止群众入山进行副业生产，这是不对的。积极的做法应该是加强组织领导，充分发动群众，使群众入山生产时自觉地遵守防火制度，保护森林。
    植树造林工作正在大跃进，护林工作也应当来个大跃进。现在应当在全国一切山区把森林无火灾运动广泛、深入地开展起来，各个县、乡，各个社，都可以展开评比竞赛，保证森林的安全，加速荒山荒地的绿化！
