Xinhua News Agency Special Manuscript: The anti-waste, anti-conservatism great blooming and contending campaign in central state organs has reached its peak. More than 80% of units have fully launched large-scale debates, in which fierce struggles between advanced and backward ideologies have formed.

During the great blooming and contending, three major fires were successively ignited within the central state organs. Initially, the focus was on opposing waste, then gradually deepened to opposing conservatism, and finally, many organs further mobilized the masses to "burn" the leadership, concentrating on exposing the shortcomings and errors of leading cadres. By igniting these three major fires in one go, the blooming and contending were basically thorough. The masses posted more than five million big-character posters, held nearly a thousand anti-waste exhibitions, and convened a large number of blooming and contending forums. Some staff members said that this blooming and contending was practically non-stop, truly "It is bitter! It is joyful!" Now they have said almost everything they wanted to say, and people's moods are greatly relieved and greatly encouraged.

**Proposing Leap Forward Programs to Deepen Debate**

So many opinions have been put forward by the masses of each organ and are considered a great harvest for the rectification movement. However, with so many big-character posters, how to analyze and organize them, according to what opinions to carry out rectification, and how to carry out the debate are important issues at present. The First Ministry of Machine Building relied on the masses to come up with two methods. During this blooming and contending, the masses of this ministry posted a total of 900,000 big-character posters. At the beginning, the leaders felt at a loss what to do with so many big-character posters, and even had trouble sleeping. Later, summarizing the experiences of the masses, they put forward the slogan of "Everyone writes, everyone reads, everyone organizes, everyone debates, everyone solves." On the one hand, they mobilized the masses to pick their own "big watermelons" and organize debates; on the other hand, they organized and solved the easy-to-solve problems separately by section and division. The second method of this ministry was for leading cadres to summarize the opinions of the big-character posters, combine them with the actual situation of the unit, propose programmatic opinions for the unit's rectification, and post big-character posters to mobilize the masses to debate. They called this method "throwing out the program, debating the program, establishing the program." When the program is upheld, the details will follow. By grasping the key major problems, debating them thoroughly, and solving them, a large number of minor problems will be easily solved.

The great debate of the Double-Anti Movement is essentially a fierce struggle between the ideas of leap forward and conservatism, advanced and backward. During the debate, some organs saw arguments between so-called "gradual change theory" and "sudden change theory." The "gradual change theory" proponents advocated that "not everyone can be Wang Chonglun," "people's abilities always have limits, they cannot change suddenly, they can only change gradually." The "sudden change theory" proponents believed that this was a conservative idea that "only sees things and does not see people," failing to see the role of the human factor. Some units saw a battle between the "law-abiding faction" and the "breakthrough faction." The "law-abiding faction" proponents advocated that all norms were "sacred," and they were afraid that people would break unreasonable norms and "the world would be in chaos." The "breakthrough faction" proponents believed that this was a conservative idea of rigidly adhering to norms and sticking to the old ways. Some units saw "accident theory" proponents in the debate. They always imagined the worst in everything, planned for the worst, and always wanted to prevent "accidents" from happening and always wanted to retain the strongest reserve force "in case of unforeseen circumstances." Some organs even saw open "neutralists" in the debate, advocating neither falling behind nor leaping forward, and being content with maintaining the status quo. The emergence of these opposing ideas and views in the debate is a normal phenomenon and a good thing, indicating the deepening of the rectification movement. Grasping these ideas and conducting full debates will greatly raise people's awareness, thus uncovering new potential and bringing new leaps forward to work. When the automobile maintenance plant affiliated to the State Council's Bureau of Foreign Experts debated the issue of automobile repair and maintenance, it was believed that the task targets set in the past were too conservative, the man-hours were too long, the operating methods were outdated, and the phenomenon of idling was serious. Therefore, a new plan for improvement was proposed. Three different attitudes emerged in the debate. Young workers and apprentices supported reducing man-hours, some technicians remained neutral, and some veteran technicians doubted and opposed the new plan, believing that the old rules were skilled and could ensure quality and quantity. After three debates, the conservative ideology opposing the new plan gained the upper hand. At this time, the Party branch immediately mobilized the masses to set up two experimental groups. The experimental results showed that the new plan was successful, the man-hours were greatly reduced, the production efficiency was increased by more than three times, and more than 8,000 yuan of wages could be saved throughout the year. In this way, everyone's thinking was cleared up and they received a profound education.

**Such Huge Potential is Really Exciting**

Now, the debate in each organ has been fully launched, and the focus of the debate is how to lead to a comprehensive leap forward in national work. These days, there are thousands of large and small battlefields in the entire organ every day. People are seizing various typical examples and hotly debating how to implement the socialist construction line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This great debate will have a far-reaching impact on the speed of the entire national construction. Through 21 thematic debates such as sulfuric acid fixed-point design, the Ministry of Chemical Industry thoroughly broke conservative ideas, criticized bourgeois design ideas, and brought about a new situation of a comprehensive leap forward in work. In the debate, this ministry dissected a medium-sized ammonium sulfate plant with an annual output of 200,000 tons. The original plan was to invest 85 million yuan. After a fierce debate, it was definitely believed that the investment could be saved by 25 million yuan. During the second five-year plan period, this ministry initially planned to build and expand nearly 30 such plants, which could save more than 700 million yuan in investment. Such huge potential moved everyone who participated in the debate. Many engineering and technical personnel submitted challenge letters and pledges, some expressing that in order to save the funds accumulated by the people's blood and sweat, they would make a big leap in their work, doing five months of work in two months, and no matter how much rework, they would produce drawings on May Day for Chairman Mao to review. Through the debate, the leading cadres of this ministry not only went deep into the economic field and the political and ideological field, but also began to go deep into the technical field. They personally discovered that technical waste was one of the biggest loopholes that produced waste. Some directors and deputy directors said that this debate enabled them to start uncovering the secrets of technology, and they would dare to grasp technical issues in the future. After 21 thematic debates, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is now confident that during the second five-year plan period, general chemical plants can achieve the following: three become five, two become three, and one becomes two.

To combine the great debate with the great leap forward, it is very important for the leadership to have a clear understanding. According to the opinions of the masses' blooming and contending and the actual situation of this ministry, the First Ministry of Machine Building is prepared to throw out seven programs for the masses to debate. These seven programs are: the ministry's long-term leap forward plan, basic construction leap forward plan, annual leap forward plan, technological leap forward plan, rules and regulations, forty articles on leadership methods in the machinery industry, and making cadres in the machinery industry both red and expert. The ministry has now announced the first four programs to the masses. They have conducted extensive investigations and research with fraternal departments and put forward the resounding slogans of "six guarantees" and "fourizations." That is, in the industrial field, it is necessary to guarantee the supply of equipment needed for steel, electricity, coal, petroleum, transportation, and general machinery; in the agricultural field, it is necessary to quickly supplement farmers' physical labor with machinery, mobilize the masses to debate whether it is possible to achieve water conservancy mechanization in three years, agricultural mechanization in five years, agricultural field chemical fertilizer application in seven or eight years, and rural electrification in ten years. Currently, the staff of the First Ministry of Machine Building is hotly debating the several programs put forward by the ministry. When there are many debates in the whole organ, there are more than 100 in a day, and major leap forward indicators sometimes change every day.

**Finding Politics Through Economy, Investigating Ideology Beyond Production**

In order to learn how to debate and make the debate thorough, all organs are paying attention to preventing two deviations: one is empty debate that does not grasp the key and typical problems, and the other is debate that is limited to purely technical and administrative matters, failing to implement the spirit of rectification in the debate, improve thinking, and summarize lessons. In the debate, the Beijing First Engineering Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering emphasized "finding politics through economy and investigating ideology beyond production." Some engineers reviewed their ideas of being divorced from the current reality, loving high standards, loving grandeur, loving complete equipment, and loving new materials, which violated the idea of building the country diligently and thriftily, and believed that this was the ideological root cause of waste. There are ten chief engineers in this institute who did not pay much attention to politics in the past. This time, they jointly proposed to strive for self-transformation and achieve "the older, the redder." Through the debate on technical issues, the Ministry of Chemical Industry examined that some leading cadres had serious subjective and bureaucratic work styles that were divorced from reality. For example, in the past, leading cadres often conducted principled reviews when reviewing designs, neither relying on the masses nor doing detailed work themselves. The leaders at the design institute level were like this, and the section-level leaders and professional group leaders were also unclear about how the subordinates worked. Only the team leaders truly mastered the technical destiny.

At present, the central state organs are seizing the link of in-depth debate to comprehensively strengthen ideological construction, correct the deviation of "emphasizing things but not people," and require that leadership thinking be liberated, transformed, and improved through debate, and especially that intellectuals and engineering and technical personnel deeply understand the meaning of "both red and expert" in order to promote the great leap forward in production and construction.

    提出纲领　辩论透彻　着重解决大问题
    中央国家机关发动群众讨论建设路线促进建设速度
    本报特约新华社专稿　中央国家机关反浪费反保守的大鸣大放已经达到了高峰，现在有80％以上的单位全面展开了大争大辩，在辩论中形成了先进思想和落后思想的激烈斗争。
    在大鸣大放中，中央国家机关内连烧了三把大火，开始时着重反浪费，以后逐步深入到反保守，最后许多机关又进一步发动群众“烧”领导，集中揭发领导干部的缺点和错误。这样一鼓作气连烧三把大火，鸣放基本上深透了，群众共贴出了五百多万张大字报，举办了近千个反浪费展览会，召开了大量的鸣放座谈会。有的工作人员说，这次鸣放简直不分昼夜，真是“不亦苦乎！不亦乐乎！”现在他们想说的话差不多都说了，人们的心情大为舒畅，大为振奋。
    提出跃进纲领深入展开辩论
    各机关群众提出这样多的意见，被认为是整风运动的一个大丰收。但是，大字报这样多，怎样进行分析整理，按照什么意见进行整改，怎样展开辩论，是当前的一个重要问题。第一机械工业部依靠群众想出了两种办法，这个部在这次鸣放中，群众共贴出了九十万张大字报，开始时领导方面对这样多的大字报简直感到无所措手足，甚至连觉都睡不好。后来总结群众的经验，提出了“大家写，大家看，大家整理，大家辩论，大家解决”的口号，一方面发动群众自己挑选自己的“大西瓜”，组织辩论，一方面以科处为单位分头整理和解决那些容易解决的问题。这个部的第二种办法就是由领导干部归纳大字报的意见，结合本单位的情况，提出本单位整改的纲领性意见，贴出大字报发动群众辩论。他们把这种方法叫做“抛纲、论纲、立纲”。纲举则目张，以大带小，抓住关键性的大问题辩透了，解决了，大量的小问题也将迎刃而解。
    双反运动的大辩论，实质上是一场跃进和保守、先进和落后思想的激烈斗争。在辩论中，有的机关出现了所谓“渐变论”和“突变论”两个对立面的争辩，“渐变论”者主张“不能人人都当王崇伦”、“人的能力总有极限，不能突变，只能渐变”，“突变论”者认为这是“只见物不见人”的保守思想，看不到人的因素的作用；有的单位出现了“守法派”和“突破派”的论战，“守法派”者主张一切规范都是“神圣”的，他们害怕人们冲破了不合理的规范就要“天下大乱”，“突破派”者认为这是死扣规范因循守旧的保守思想；有的单位在辩论中出现了“意外论”者，他们对一切事情总是往坏处设想，往坏处打算，办事情总要预防“意外情况”发生，总要保留最雄厚的后备力量，“以防不测”；还有的机关在辩论中出现了公开的“中立派”，主张既不落后，也不跃进，能够维持现状就心安理得。在辩论中出现这些对立的思想和看法是正常的现象，是好事情，这表明了整风运动的深入；各机关抓住这些思想进行充分的辩论，就大大地提高了人们的觉悟，因而发掘出新的潜力，给工作带来新的跃进。国务院外国专家局所属的一个汽车保养厂在辩论汽车的修理保养问题时，曾认为过去规定的任务指标太保守，工时太长，操作方法陈旧，窝工现象严重，因此提出了改进的新方案。辩论中出现三种不同的态度，青年工人和徒工拥护降低工时，一部分技工保持中立，有些老技工怀疑和反对新方案，认为旧规则熟练，能保质保量。经过三次辩论，反对新方案的保守思想占了上风，这时党支部立即发动群众成立了两个试验小组，试验结果新方案成功了，工时大大降低，生产效率提高了三倍多，全年就可以节省工资八千多元，这样一来大家的思想通了，并且受到了深刻的教育。
    潜力这样巨大实在激动人心
    现在，各机关的辩论已经全面展开，辩论的锋芒是如何引向国家工作的全面大跃进。这些天以来，整个机关中每天都有千百个大大小小的战场，人们抓住各种典型事例，热烈地争辩如何贯彻又多又快又好又省的社会主义建设路线，这场大争辩，势将对整个国家建设的速度发生深远的影响。化工部通过硫酸定型设计等二十一个专题辩论，彻底打破了保守思想，批判了资产阶级设计思想，给工作带来了全面大跃进的新形势。这个部在辩论中解剖了一个年产二十万吨的中型硫酸铵厂，这个厂原计划投资八千五百万元，经过一场激烈的辩论之后，肯定地认为可以节省投资二千五百万元，这个部在第二个五年计划期间，初步预定要新建和扩建近三十个这样的厂子，共可节省投资七亿元以上。这样巨大的潜力，使参加辩论的人都动心了，许多工程技术人员纷纷递挑战书、决心书，有的表示要为了节约人民用血汗积累的资金，在工作上来个大飞跃，两个月做五个月的事，不管多大的返工，都要在“五一”节出图，请毛主席检阅。经过辩论，这个部的领导干部不仅深入到经济领域，政治思想领域，而且开始深入到技术的领域，他们亲自发现技术上的浪费是产生浪费的一个最大的漏洞。有些司局长说，这次辩论使他们开始揭开了技术的秘密，以后他们就敢抓技术问题了。化工部经过二十一个专题辩论，现在已有把握使第二个五年计划期内一般的化工厂分别作到：三个变五个，二个变三个和一个变二个。
    要使大辩论同大跃进结合起来，领导方面心中有数非常重要。第一机械工业部根据群众鸣放的意见和这个部的实际情况，准备抛出七条纲由群众辩论，这七条纲是：部的长远跃进规划、基本建设跃进规划、年度跃进计划、技术跃进规划、规章制度、机械工业领导方法四十条、机械工业干部又红又专等。现在部里已经向群众公布了前四条纲，他们广泛地向兄弟部门作了调查研究，提出了“六保”“四化”的响亮口号，这就是在工业方面要保证供应钢、电、煤、石油、交通、通用机械等方面需要的设备；在农业方面，要尽快地给农民的体力劳动辅之以机械，发动群众辩论能否在三年内实现水利机械化、在五年内实现农业机械化、在七、八年内实现农田化肥化、在十年内实现农村电气化等设备要求。现在，一机部的工作人员正围绕部里所提出的几条纲热烈地展开争辩，全机关辩论会多的时候一天有一百多个，重大的跃进指标有时一天一个行市。
    透过经济找政治跳出生产查思想
    为了学会辩论，使辩论能够深透，各机关正注意防止两种偏向：一种是抓不住关键、抓不住典型问题不着边际的空洞辩论；一种是流于纯技术性、事务性的辩论，不能在辩论中贯彻整风精神，提高思想，总结出教训。建筑工程部北京第一工程设计院在辩论中，强调“透过经济找政治，跳出生产查思想”，有的工程师通过辩论和实地检查，检讨了自己脱离当前实际的爱标准高、爱派头大、爱设备全、爱材料新等违背勤俭建国的思想，认为这是造成浪费的思想根子。这个院有十位老总工程师，过去不大过问政治，这次联合倡议，要努力自我改造，做到“越老越红”。化工部通过技术问题的辩论，检查了有些领导干部有严重的脱离实际的主观主义、官僚主义作风。例如过去领导干部在审查设计时，往往是原则的审查，既不依靠群众，又不动手做细致的工作，设计院一级的领导是如此，科一级领导和专业组长也不清楚下面如何工作，只有小组长才是真正掌握技术命运的。
    目前，中央国家机关正抓紧深入辩论这个环节，做到全面地加强思想建设工作，纠正“重事不重人”的偏向，要求通过辩论解放领导思想，改造领导思想，提高领导思想，并且特别使知识分子和工程技术人员深刻地理解“又红又专”的意义，以促进生产建设的大跃进。
