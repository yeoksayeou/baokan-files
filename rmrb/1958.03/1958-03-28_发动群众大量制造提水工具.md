	Leaping Forward Rapid Waterwheel
	Created by Henan farmers. This waterwheel mainly utilizes a large wheel driving a small wheel, increasing the efficiency of water extraction. Two laborers can irrigate twelve to fourteen mu of land per day.
	
	Animal-Powered Water Pump Replaces Machine
	Created by Zhang Zhensheng of Guzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Shenze County, Hebei. When installed on a well and pulled by two livestock, it can pump the same amount of water as a five-horsepower boiler engine. This machine costs only 500 yuan to manufacture, saving one-half compared to a five-horsepower boiler engine.
	
	Hydraulic Automatic Waterwheel
	Created by Chen Zhen, Chen Jifu, and others of Langzhongzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Zunhua County, Hebei.
	This waterwheel costs only 260 yuan. Its efficiency is very high, equivalent to a ten-horsepower boiler engine. It utilizes the force of the water and can rotate continuously day and night. If the riverbank has a large and rapid flow, a dam is not necessary. For small rivers or large canals with a stable flow, a dam can be appropriately built to create a water drop to also allow for use. Depending on the water source size, more or fewer waterwheels can be used.
	
	Wind-Powered Hand-Cranked Waterwheel
	Created by Li Yanchen of Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative, Fugou County, Henan. With a force four wind, it can drive a Liberation-style waterwheel, irrigating fifteen mu of land per day; it can be hand-cranked when there is no wind.
	
	Cotton Ginning and Water Pumping Dual-Purpose Machine
	Created by Hao Village Agricultural Cooperative, Xiaoji Township, Xinxiang County, Henan. A wooden Liberation-style waterwheel gear is installed on the right side of the existing cotton gin's axle, along with a chain, water pipe, and water scoop. The machine rotates when the operator steps on the cotton gin's baseboard. This waterwheel is very efficient, irrigating eight or nine mu of land every eight hours, equivalent to the efficiency of two Liberation-style waterwheels. When not irrigating, it can still gin cotton. (Attached image)

    发动群众大量制造提水工具
    跃进快速水车
    河南农民创造。这种水车主要是利用大轮带小轮，加大了抽水效率，用两个劳力每天可浇地十二至十四亩。
    马拉水泵代机器
    河北深泽县孤庄农业社张振生创造。安到井上用两个牲口拉，能顶一台五马力锅驼机的抽水量。这架机器只需五百元即可制成，比一台五马力的锅驼机省二分之一。
    水力自动水车
    河北遵化县郎仲庄农业社陈振、陈继富等创造。
    这种水车成本只二百六十元。它的效力很大，相当于一台十马力锅驼机的效能。它利用水的冲力，能够昼夜不停地转动。如果河坡大水流急，还可以不筑坝，水流平稳的小河或大渠道，若根据水量适当搭坝，造成河水落差，也能利用。根据水源大小可以多带或少带水车。
    风力手摇水车河
    南扶沟县红光农业社李彦臣创造。在四级风力时可带动一部解放式水车，一天浇地十五亩；无风时可用手摇。
    轧花抽水两用机
    河南新乡县小冀乡郝村农业社创造。是在原有轧花车的车轴右面安上一部木质的解放式水车齿轮，加上链条、水管、水簸箕即成。以脚踏轧花车底板，车即转动。这种水车功效很高，每八小时可浇地八、九亩，顶两部解放式水车的效能。不浇地时仍可轧花。（附图片）
