    Advancing Towards the Goal of Being "Red to the Core and Expert"
    Recently, Peking University and other universities have been conducting a major debate on the issue of "Redness" versus "Expertise." Professors at Peking University have launched criticism and self-criticism, and are also engaged in a struggle between two roads and two methods in conjunction with their professional work. Many professors have sincerely expressed their desire to dedicate their hearts to the Communist Party and the people. Their words and actions demonstrate that the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals in our country, especially senior intellectuals, has now advanced to a new stage. This is that in the midst of the intense unfolding of the "Double-Anti" movement across the country, intellectuals are consciously demanding to further deepen their self-transformation, and strive to be "Red to the Core and Expert." This is a new phenomenon under the new situation in our country. This new phenomenon is extremely valuable.
    Our country, in the past eight years, has experienced revolutions in ownership and on the political and ideological fronts, and has achieved great victories. The broad masses of working people are urgently demanding the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist motherland. On the fronts of industrial and agricultural production, various astonishing miracles have begun to appear. The enthusiasm of the people is impacting the superstructure, demanding the thorough elimination of bureaucracy, extravagance, complacency, arrogance, and squeamishness that hinder the advancement of socialist construction.
    Science, technology, culture, and education are important aspects of socialist construction. Without the great leap forward in science, technology, culture, and education, the great leap forward in socialist construction will inevitably be limited. Any economic base requires a superstructure adapted to it to serve it. After the victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there is a need for a strong contingent of working-class intellectuals. The contingent of working-class intellectuals in our country is in the process of growing, and for the sake of the great leap forward in the socialist cause, the contingent of working-class intellectuals should accelerate its growth. The primary task of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres today is to study hard and improve their knowledge level. And the existing intellectuals must carry out ideological remolding and transform themselves into working-class intellectuals.
    "Existence determines consciousness." People from the old society are inevitably influenced by the ideas of the old society. Most intellectuals grew up in landlord and bourgeois families, and were subjected to bourgeois education for a long time. After leaving school, they depended on the bourgeoisie for a living. As a result, most of them have their minds filled with bourgeois consciousness. This is undeniable. In the past eight years, successive political movements, especially the ideological remolding movement, have had a certain impact on intellectuals. Some intellectuals have already realized this change in the situation and are determined to transform themselves and serve the people and socialism wholeheartedly. However, there are still a considerable number of intellectuals who fail to recognize this point and have not consciously transformed themselves; their transformation is still very incomplete. They still proceed from personal fame and gain and narrow interests, and engage in work based on bourgeois academic viewpoints. They emphasize professional work and neglect politics, pursue personal fame and gain and personal interests, their theories are divorced from reality, and they lack proletarian feelings. Some researchers, for the sake of personal fame, can watch the country's production suffer losses and refuse to study the problems raised in production. Some professors, for the sake of their personal authority, can watch the quality of students fail to improve, keep knowledge private, and refuse to teach it to students. Some engineers have not studied their profession for several years, but pretend to be experts, causing losses to the country's construction. Some writers do not transform their thinking and instill bourgeois ideological poisons into readers in their works. More seriously, some people pretend to be academic authorities, some steal the achievements of others, some suppress new forces, and some are complacent and conservative.
    "Not being Red and not being expert is the greatest waste," this sentence reveals a truth. In research institutions, in universities, in creative units, in medical institutions, in engineering and technical departments, after the "Double-Anti" movement entered its climax, the spearhead was directed at the serious waste and serious conservatism caused by intellectuals not being Red and not being expert. Intellectuals with serious bourgeois individualism are not playing a promoting role in this great era, but rather a hindering one. They have become obstacles to the current great leap forward in socialist science, technology, culture, and education. It should be admitted that there is still a struggle between two roads, the bourgeois and the proletarian, in our science, technology, culture, and education today. Of course, there is also a struggle between two methods: more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. The struggle between two roads on the science, technology, culture, and education front is an arduous and complex struggle. To "promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois," and to "let the East Wind prevail over the West Wind" in this area, so as to make a great leap forward in science, technology, culture, and education, there must be a considerable number of scholars and experts who are Red to the core and expert in science, technology, culture, and education. Whichever discipline first cultivates scholars and experts who are Red to the core and expert, that discipline will first achieve "promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois" and a great leap forward will appear.
    The issue of Redness and expertise has been debated in more depth in many universities since September of last year. Through the debate, the socialist consciousness of many young students has been raised to some extent. However, among senior intellectuals, the understanding of this issue is still not very clear. Some people think: "As long as senior intellectuals hand over their professional skills, they are serving socialism." Some people think: "There is not enough time to become expert, there is no way to be both Red and expert at the same time." Some people think: "Being expert but not Red is a greater contribution to the country than being Red but not expert." These muddled ideas are manifested as "emphasizing professional work and neglecting politics" and "emphasizing talent and neglecting morality." They have not figured out the requirements of "Redness," and they have not understood the principle that politics is in command.
    What is "Redness"? "Redness" requires every intellectual to have a political attitude suitable for socialist society. Our society has undergone a revolution, and private ownership has been transformed into socialist ownership. The base has changed, and the superstructure must also change. People's thinking must also undergo a revolution, eliminate bourgeois individualism, and establish a working-class collectivist concept. That is to say, it requires everyone to have the determination to serve the people and socialism wholeheartedly. Bourgeois individualism is the force that leads our society to split into thousands of selfish and self-interested small groups and individuals, vying with each other for their own interests, thereby dragging our society towards capitalist regression. This point has been illustrated by the facts revealed in numerous big-character posters in the "Double-Anti" movement. Politics is in command, politics is the soul. Without a political consciousness that is compatible with socialism, people will lose their way, and they will not only fail to be good builders of socialism, but may even go down the path of reaction.
    Is it difficult to achieve both Redness and expertise, and to be Red to the core and expert? Of course, there are difficulties. The academic level of our country is not high to begin with, and it is indeed a difficulty to catch up with the world level in twelve years while also carrying out ideological remolding. But the primary condition for catching up with the world level in twelve years is Redness. This Redness refers to collectivist thought. It is fundamentally impossible to catch up with the world level single-handedly. Only by organizing the strength of scientists, and everyone catching up with one heart and one mind collectively, eliminating the individualistic division of forces to study some minor issues, and concentrating everyone's strength and wisdom to study the practical problems pointed out in the process of production and life and the fundamental problems in science, can we catch up with the world level.
    For natural scientists, we do not require them to be both scientists and political theorists, and political activists. We only require them to have socialist consciousness, establish collectivist thinking and style, be determined to serve the people, and not be divorced from politics. For philosophers, they must have a high degree of socialist consciousness, and must understand the most general objective laws of change and development in nature, society, and cognition. They must have both knowledge of natural science and knowledge of social science. Otherwise, they will have nothing to say, and will be neither Red nor expert, but merely "metaphysical ghosts." For social scientists, they must have a certain amount of philosophical and social science knowledge, and for a social science that they are researching, they must thoroughly proceed from a Marxist point of view.
    Being expert but not Red, or being Red but not expert, is the greatest waste of national manpower. We oppose being expert but not Red, and we also oppose being Red but not expert. In socialist society, everyone must exert their personal role through the great superiority of socialist collective strength. People who are expert but not Red, because they are not Red, do not rely on the collective, but rely on subjective imagination, are short-sighted, and do their own thing. This is a pragmatist who has lost direction, and he will inevitably fall behind others academically. Therefore, one cannot be deeply expert without being Red to the core. People who are Red but not expert, because they are not expert, cannot grasp the key issues in their work. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Without concrete analysis, one cannot understand the characteristics of any contradiction." Politics that cannot guide practical work and life is empty politics. This kind of Redness has no practical significance. Therefore, being expert but not Red is "waste," and being Red but not expert is also "waste." The only difference is that people who are expert but not Red, when individualism develops to an extremely serious degree, will have a destructive effect on socialism.
    In our country, the socialist revolution in ownership has been basically completed. Bourgeois intellectuals are already in a situation of "when the skin is gone, what can the hair adhere to?" The vast majority of them are willing to transform themselves, serve socialism, and be with the working people, and jointly strive to build socialism. But to truly become working-class intellectuals, they must earnestly transform themselves politically and ideologically. They must accept the ideological and political leadership of the proletariat; take proletarian politics as the commander, and promote the rapid leap forward of science, technology, culture, and education on the socialist path. Science, technology, culture, and education must rely on intellectuals to work. The progress and backwardness of the political thinking of intellectuals are related to the development of science, technology, culture, and education in our country, and also related to the development of the entire construction cause in our country.
    All intellectuals who are willing to make progress should now be determined to undergo this painful but ultimately refreshing ideological struggle. They must have the determination of Sun Wukong to jump into Lao Jun's furnace to be tempered, and let the fierce flames of the mass "Double-Anti" movement burn them for forty-nine days. Only after such tempering, under the education of the masses, can they correctly recognize themselves. The deeper they recognize their own mistakes and shortcomings, the greater their determination to transform themselves will be. Only after such ideological transformation will intellectuals truly be lively, cheerful, and full of enthusiasm.
    The era is advancing, and the situation is urging people to advance. In the "Double-Anti" movement, many advanced intellectuals have recognized the current situation, consciously demanded transformation, and put forward the challenge of being Red to the core and expert. Many advanced intellectuals have written big-character posters with the masses in the "Double-Anti" movement, exposing problems and inviting fire to burn themselves. Many advanced intellectuals have already experienced the tempering of the rectification movement, deeply recognized themselves, and are determined to undergo a complete transformation and put this determination into action.
    In today's world of ten thousand horses galloping forward, the prospect of a great leap forward in the thinking of intellectuals has emerged. Let the flames of the "Double-Anti" movement burn away the bourgeois individualism of intellectuals, and burn away bourgeois academic thought. With the leap forward in the thinking of intellectuals, a magnificent scene of prosperity, abundance, and blossoming of hundreds of flowers will appear in the science, technology, culture, and education of our country.

    向“红透专深”的目标前进
    最近北京大学等高等学校正在进行红与专的问题的大辩论。北大的教授们展开了批评和自我批评，并且结合业务进行两条道路和两种方法的斗争。有许多教授诚恳地表示，要把心交给共产党和人民。他们的言论和行动说明，我国知识分子特别是高级知识分子的思想改造运动，现在已经推进到新的阶段。这就是在全国双反运动的激烈开展中，知识分子自觉地要求进一步深入改造自己，力争红透专深。这是我国新形势下的新气象。这种新气象是极为可贵的。
    我们的国家，八年来经历了所有制的革命和政治思想战线上的革命，取得了巨大胜利。广大的劳动人民，迫切地要求建设起繁荣幸福的社会主义祖国。在工农业生产战线上，开始出现了各种惊人的奇迹。人民群众的热情冲击着上层建筑，要求彻底肃清障碍社会主义建设事业前进的官气、阔气、暮气、骄气和娇气。
    科学技术、文化教育是社会主义建设的一个重要方面。没有科学技术文化教育的跃进，社会主义建设事业的跃进必然会受到限制。任何经济基础都要求有与它相适应的上层建筑为它服务。我国在社会主义革命胜利以后，要求有一个强大的工人阶级的知识分子队伍。我国工人阶级知识分子队伍正在成长过程中，为了社会主义事业的跃进，工人阶级知识分子队伍应当加速成长。工人、农民和革命干部，今天的首要任务是努力学习，提高自己的知识水平。而现有的知识分子，则要进行思想改造，把自己改造成工人阶级的知识分子。
    “存在决定意识”。来自旧社会的人，都不免会受旧社会的思想影响。知识分子，他们大部分生长于地主、资产阶级家庭，长期所受的是资产阶级的教育，离开学校以后，又依附资产阶级为生，耳濡目染，他们之中的大多数，脑子里装满了资产阶级的意识。这是无可讳言的。八年来，历次的政治运动，特别是思想改造运动，对知识分子是有着一定影响的。有的知识分子已经觉悟到这一形势的变化，决心改造自己，全心全意为人民，为社会主义服务。但是，却还有相当数量的知识分子，认识不到这一点，没有自觉地改造自己，他们还改造得很不彻底。他们仍是从个人名利和狭隘兴趣出发，根据资产阶级的学术观点来从事工作。他们重业务轻政治、追求个人名利和个人兴趣，理论脱离实际，缺乏工农感情。有的研究人员为了个人成名，可以眼看国家的生产受损失，拒绝研究生产中所提出的问题。有的教授为了个人的权威地位，可以眼看学生质量提不高，把知识占为私有，保密起来不肯教给学生。有的工程师，几年来没有钻研业务，硬充行家，使国家建设受损失。有的作家，不改造自己的思想，在作品中向读者灌输资产阶级思想毒素。更严重的是，有的人假冒学术权威、有的人偷窃别人成果、有的人压制新生力量、有的人自满自足保守落后。
    “不红不专就是最大的浪费”，这句话道破了一条真理。在研究机关，在高等学校，在创作单位，在医疗机构，在工程技术部门，当双反运动进入高潮以后，矛头就都指向知识分子不红不专所引起的严重浪费和严重保守的现象。有严重资产阶级个人主义思想的知识分子在这个大时代里，他们所起的不是促进作用，而是促退作用。他们已成了当前社会主义科学技术文化教育事业跃进中的障碍。应当承认，在我们科学技术文化教育事业中，今天还存在着资产阶级和无产阶级的两条道路的斗争。当然同时也还存在着多快好省和少慢差费的两种方法的斗争。科学技术文化教育战线上的两条道路的斗争，是一场艰苦复杂的斗争，在这个方面要“兴无灭资”，要“东风压倒西风”，从而使科学技术文化教育事业跃进，必须在科学技术文化教育战线上有相当数量的红透专深的学者专家。那一门学科首先培养出红透专深的学者专家，那一门学科就将首先达到“兴无灭资”，出现大跃进的局面。
    红和专的问题，从去年9月起，在许多高等学校中展开了比较深刻的辩论。通过辩论，许多青年学生的社会主义觉悟有所提高。但是，在高级知识分子之中，这个问题的认识还不很清楚。有的人认为：“高级知识分子只要交出业务来，就是为社会主义服务。”有人认为：“专还来不及，没有办法同时又红又专。”有人认为：“专而不红比红而不专对国家贡献大。”这些糊涂观念，表现为“重业务轻政治”和“重才轻德”。他们对“红”的要求没有搞清楚，他们对政治是统帅的道理也没有理解。
    “红”是什么？“红”是要求每一个知识分子有适合于社会主义社会的政治态度。我们的社会，革了一次命，私人所有制变成了社会主义所有制了。基础变了，上层建筑也必须变。人们的思想，也必须革一次命，革掉资产阶级个人主义思想，建立起工人阶级集体主义观念。这也就是说，要求每一个人要有全心全意为人民服务，为社会主义服务的决心。资产阶级个人主义思想是引导我们的社会分裂成千千万万个自私自利的小集团和个人，各自为自己的利益互相倾轧，从而把我们的社会拖向资本主义的倒退力量。这一点，在双反运动中许许多多大字报所揭露的事实已经说明。政治是统帅，政治是灵魂。没有和社会主义相适应的政治觉悟，人们将迷失方向，他将不但不能是一个社会主义的好的建设者，相反的甚至会走到反动的道路上去。
    实现又红又专，而且要红透专深，这是不是有困难呢？当然是有困难的。我国的学术水平本来不高，十二年内要赶上世界水平，同时还要进行思想改造，这确实是一个困难。但是十二年赶上世界水平的首要条件就是红。这个红就是指的集体主义思想。想要单枪匹马赶上世界水平，是根本不可能的。只有把科学家的力量组织起来，大家一心一德地集体地来赶，排除个人主义地分兵把口地研究一些枝节问题，而集中大家的力量和智慧去研究生产和生活过程中指出来的实际问题和科学上的根本问题，这样我们才能赶上世界水平。
    对自然科学家来说，我们并不要求他既是科学家又是政治理论家、又是政治活动家。我们只要求他有社会主义的觉悟，树立集体主义的思想和作风，决心为人民服务，不脱离政治。对哲学家来说，他们要有社会主义的高度觉悟，要懂得自然界、社会及认识的变化和发展的最一般的客观规律。他既要有自然科学的知识，又要有社会科学的知识。否则，他将言之无物，既不红又不专，不过是“玄学鬼”而已。对社会科学家来说，他们要有一定的哲学和社会科学的知识，对于自己所研究的一项社会科学，必须彻底地从马克思主义观点出发。
    专而不红、红而不专，都是国家人力上的最大浪费。我们反对专而不红，我们也反对红而不专。在社会主义社会里，人人都必须通过社会主义集体力量这一巨大的优越性来发挥个人的作用。专而不红的人，由于他不红，他不依靠集体，而是凭主观想像，鼠目寸光，搞自己的一套。这就是迷失方向的实际家，他在学术上必然会落在别人的后面。因此不红透就不能专深。红而不专的人，由于他不专，他不能抓住工作中的关键性问题。毛泽东同志说过：“离开具体的分析，就不能认识任何矛盾的特性。”不能指导实际工作和生活的政治就是空头政治。这种红也就没有什么实际意义。因此专而不红是“废品”，红而不专也是“废品”。所不同的只是专而不红的人，在个人主义发展到极为严重的时候，他对社会主义会起破坏作用。
    我们的国家，在所有制方面的社会主义革命已经基本完成了。资产阶级的知识分子已经处于“皮之不存，毛将焉附”的景况中。他们的绝大多数都愿意改造自己，为社会主义服务，同劳动人民在一起，共同为建设社会主义而奋斗。但是要真正成为工人阶级的知识分子，必须认真地从政治上和思想上改造自己。接受无产阶级的思想政治领导；以无产阶级的政治为统帅，促进科学技术文化教育事业在社会主义轨道上的迅速跃进。科学技术文化教育事业是要靠知识分子来工作的，知识分子政治思想的前进和落后，关系着我国科学技术文化教育事业的发展，也关系着我国整个建设事业的发展。
    一切愿意进步的知识分子现在都应该下定决心，经历这一场痛苦的但是最后会是精神爽快的思想斗争。必须有孙悟空跳进老君炉去受锻炼的决心，让群众双反运动猛烈的火焰，把自己烧个四十九天。经过这样的熬炼，在群众的教育下，才能正确地认识自己。把自己的错误缺点认识得越深，自我改造的决心才会越大。知识分子只有经过了这样的思想改造，才真正会生动活泼，心情舒畅，充满干劲。
    时代在前进，形势在促使人前进。在双反运动中，许多先进的知识分子认清了当前的形势，自觉地要求改造，提出红透专深的挑战。许多先进知识分子在双反运动中和群众在一起写大字报，揭露问题，引火烧身。许多先进知识分子已经经历整风运动的烈火的熬炼，深刻地认识了自己，决心脱胎换骨改造自己，并将这种改造决心付诸行动。
    在万马奔腾的今天，出现了知识分子思想大跃进的前景。让双反运动的火焰烧掉知识分子的资产阶级个人主义，烧掉资产阶级的学术思想。随着知识分子思想的跃进，我国科学技术文化教育事业将出现昌盛繁荣、万紫千红、百花盛开的壮丽景象。
