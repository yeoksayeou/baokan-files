    Great Achievements and Beautiful Rivers and Mountains Coexist
    Excerpts from Charge d'Affaires Wen Zaizhu's Speech
    Dear Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, officers and soldiers of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea, esteemed Chinese representatives welcoming the Volunteers' return home, dear citizens of Andong!
    Today, right here at this border station where we bid you farewell seven years ago, we welcome the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea, warriors who have established brilliant and great feats in the struggle against the armed aggression of American imperialism, the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people, as they take their first step into their glorious motherland.
    On this occasion, on behalf of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the People's Republic of China, I extend my heartfelt gratitude and highest honor to you, who have established indelible great achievements in the struggle to defend the freedom and independence of the Korean people and peace in the Far East, and are now returning home.
    It was thanks to the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers that the situation on the Korean front became definitively favorable to us. The Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, defeated the armed aggressors of American imperialism, and made immortal great achievements in the struggle to defend the fruits of the revolution. This great achievement, as Premier Kim Il-sung said this time, will last forever along with Korea's beautiful mountains and rivers.
    The internationalist fighters sent by the Chinese people have always resolutely and faithfully implemented the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong to "cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree in Korea," thoroughly demonstrating noble political and moral qualities with a high degree of internationalism and unparalleled courage.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers not only demonstrated heroism in battle but also helped with Korea's reconstruction efforts as if it were their own affair.
    The deep love and sincere respect of the Korean people for the Chinese People's Volunteers will forever live in the hearts of our people, along with the prosperity of our country and the ever-improving happiness of the people.
    The voluntary withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, based on the proposal of the governments of Korea and China, is another manifestation of the consistent and sincere efforts made by the governments of Korea and China to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    The troops of American imperialism and the countries that follow it must withdraw from South Korea, and the issue of our country's reunification must be resolved by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference.
    The Korean people, united as one around the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung, will stand more firmly at the eastern outpost defending peace and socialism and will certainly overcome all difficulties and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    I am confident that after you return to your dearest great motherland, you will widely convey the Korean people's infinite friendship and respect for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers to your beloved brothers and sisters, and I am confident that you will devote yourselves to the cause of friendly cooperation between the Korean and Chinese people and to the socialist construction of your own great motherland, which is undergoing a great leap forward.

    伟大功勋与锦绣江山并存
    文在洙代办的讲话（摘要）
    亲爱的张天云中将同志，英雄的中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜部队官兵们，尊敬的中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团，亲爱的安东市市民们！
    现在，我们正是在七年以前欢送你们的这个国境车站上，欢迎在反抗朝中两国人民共同的敌人美帝国主义武装侵略者的斗争中建立了光辉的伟大功迹，第一步踏入光荣的祖国的英雄的中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜部队勇士们。
    借此机会，我代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中华人民共和国大使馆，向在保卫朝鲜人民的自由独立和远东和平的斗争中，建立了永不可磨灭的伟大功勋而返国的你们致以衷心的谢意和最高的荣誉。
    由于中国人民志愿军的参战，朝鲜前线的形势才变得肯定地对我们有利。志愿军勇士们同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，击溃了美帝国主义武装侵略者，在保卫革命果实的斗争中立下了不朽的伟大功勋。这种巨大的功绩，正如金日成首相这次所说的一样，将同朝鲜美丽的山河一起万古长青。
    中国人民派遣的国际主义战士，一向坚决而又忠实地执行了中国共产党和毛泽东主席“要爱护朝鲜的一山、一水、一草、一木”的教导，以高度的国际主义精神和无比的勇敢精神，彻底表现了崇高的政治、道德品质。
    中国人民志愿军不仅在战斗中发挥了英雄精神，而且还像做自己的事一样，帮助了朝鲜的恢复建设工作。
    朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的深切的爱戴和由衷的尊敬，将同我们祖国的繁荣和日益提高的人民的幸福生活一起，永远活在我国人民的心里。
    中国人民志愿军根据朝中两国政府的建议主动撤出朝鲜，是朝中两国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题所做的一贯真诚努力的又一表现。
    美帝国主义和追随它的国家的军队必须撤出南朝鲜，我们祖国的统一问题必须由朝鲜人民自己在不受外国干涉的情况下解决。
    坚如磐石地团结在以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府周围的朝鲜人民，将更加坚定地站在保卫和平和社会主义的东方前哨，并一定要克服一切困难，实现祖国的和平统一。
    我确信，你们回到自己最亲爱的伟大祖国以后，将会把朝鲜人民对中国人民和中国人民志愿军的无限友爱和尊敬的情谊，广泛转达给自己亲爱的兄弟姊妹们，并深信你们为朝中两国人民的友好合作事业和为正在大跃进的自己祖国社会主义建设事业进行忘我奋斗。
