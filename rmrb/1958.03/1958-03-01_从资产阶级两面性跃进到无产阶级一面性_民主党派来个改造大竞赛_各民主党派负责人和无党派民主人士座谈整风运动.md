Xinhua News Agency, 28th: At a forum held on the afternoon of the 27th, responsible persons of various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures exchanged views on how to further carry out the rectification movement.

Speaking at the forum were He Xiangning, Cheng Qian, Gao Chongmin, Xu Deheng, Yang Zhongjian, Zhou Peiyuan, Ji Fang, Chen Qiyou, Wang Shao'ao, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Tu Changwang and others. They believed that the democratic parties must further carry out a general rectification movement on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, and continue to carry out fundamental self-transformation, in order to adapt to the requirements of the great leap forward in China's socialist cause. They also believed that the principles and purposes of the general rectification of the democratic parties are to promote both revolution and unity, and are the continuation, universality and depth of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, the nature of which is still the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism.

Many people pointed out in their speeches that a self-transformation movement should be launched through rectification, a great emulation of self-transformation should be launched, a great leap forward should be made in position and thought, a leap from the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie to the one-sidedness of the proletariat, a leap from half-heartedness towards the Communist Party and the socialist cause to wholeheartedness, and a leap from the bourgeois position to the proletarian position, so as to become both red and expert, and even redder and more expert intellectuals in a few years. Yang Zhongjian, a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, used sixteen characters to summarize the characteristics of bourgeois intellectuals: "Knowledge is privately owned, individuals work alone, technology is conservative, and they are unwilling to open their hearts." He believes that these four mountains must be removed before it is possible to serve the socialist cause well. Zhou Peiyuan, a famous Chinese physicist, said that he would not only hand over his heart, but also his life, to the Party and to the socialist cause. He also read out a response letter written on the 25th by nineteen members of the Jiusan Society, including Xu Deheng and Liang Xi, regarding the proposal of the seventeen scientists in Shanghai. The response letter stated: We must learn well from the seventeen scientists in Shanghai, hand over our hearts to the Party and the great socialist construction cause.

    从资产阶级两面性跃进到无产阶级一面性
    民主党派来个改造大竞赛
    各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士座谈整风运动
    据新华社28日讯　27日下午，各民主党派的负责人和无党派民主人士举行的座谈会上，就如何进一步开展整风运动交换了意见。
    在座谈会上发言的，有何香凝、程潜、高崇民、许德珩、杨钟健、周培源、季方、陈其尤、王绍鳌、黄炎培、陈叔通、凃长望等人。他们认为，各民主党派必须在反右派斗争胜利的基础上进一步开展一般整风，继续进行根本的自我改造，才能适应我国社会主义事业大跃进的要求。他们还认为，各民主党派进行一般整风的方针和目的，是既要促进革命、又要促进团结，是政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的继续普遍和深入，其性质仍然是资本主义同社会主义两条道路的斗争。
    许多人在发言中提出，要通过整风掀起一个自我改造的运动，来一个自我改造的大竞赛，在立场上和思想上来一个大跃进，从资产阶级的两面性跃进到无产阶级的一面性，从对共产党和社会主义事业的三心二意跃进到全心全意，从资产阶级立场跃进到无产阶级立场，在几年内成为又红又专、更红更专的知识分子。九三学社中央委员、中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室主任杨钟健用十六个字来概括资产阶级知识分子的特点，这就是：“知识私有、个人单干、技术保守、不肯交心。”他认为，这四座大山不搬掉，就不可能很好地为社会主义事业服务。中国著名物理学家周培源说，他不仅要把心交出来，而且要把生命交出来，交给党，交给社会主义事业。他还宣读了九三学社成员许德珩、梁希等十九人，在25日写的关于响应上海十七名科学家倡议的响应书。响应书说：我们要很好地向上海的十七位科学家学习，把心交出来，交给党和伟大的社会主义建设事业。
