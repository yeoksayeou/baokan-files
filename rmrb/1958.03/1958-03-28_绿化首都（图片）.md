    Greening the Capital
    Not afraid of strong winds, not afraid of sand and dust in their eyes, the Young Pioneers of Dong Tang Xi Bo Street Elementary School are planting trees in Chongwen District.
    The seedlings from the Temple of Heaven Nursery have been moved. The students of Eleventh Middle School are planting new seedlings in the empty space. Plant one, grow one. The students of Ninety Middle School are carrying water to irrigate the trees.

    绿化首都
    不怕你刮大风，不怕沙土迷人眼睛，东唐洗泊街小学的红领巾在崇文区植树。
    天坛苗圃的树秧移走了，十一中学的同学们又在空地种上新苗。种一株长一株，九十中学的同学挑水灌溉树木。
