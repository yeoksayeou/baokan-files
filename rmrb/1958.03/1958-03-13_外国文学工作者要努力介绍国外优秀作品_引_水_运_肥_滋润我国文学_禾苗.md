Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The capital's foreign literature workers gathered on the 11th to discuss the development of literary translation work and put forward their respective leap forward plans. Those who spoke at the symposium included Shao Quanlin, Cao Jinghua, Li Jianwu, Bian Zhilin, Zhu Baoguang, Jin Kemu, Gao Zhi, Ye Junjian, Chen Bingyi, Ge Baoquan, and others.

Shao Quanlin said in his speech that the overall plan for introducing foreign works should be combined with the personal plans of each foreign literature worker. The plan should take into account various aspects such as classical and modern works, literary and theoretical works, and long and short works, without neglecting any of them. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the abridged translation of foreign literary works to meet the needs of popularization.

Cao Jinghua suggested that foreign literature workers should create conditions for high yields like farmers, leading in "water" and transporting "fertilizer," bringing useful "water" from foreign literature to China to nourish our literary "seedlings" and strive for a great harvest of socialist literature. Cao Jinghua said: In the giant wave of the great leap forward in literary work, foreign literature workers should have a great leap forward in translation style so that translated works are easily accepted by the majority of readers.

Many foreign literature workers mentioned in their speeches that they should strive for a great leap forward in both the quantity and quality of foreign literature work. Bian Zhilin plans to complete two research papers on Shakespeare's tragedies "King Lear" and "Macbeth" this year, and together with the papers already completed on the two major tragedies ("Hamlet" and "Othello"), he plans to compile them into a book entitled "On Shakespeare's Four Great Tragedies" next year. Li Jianwu plans to complete the collection of Molière's comedies by 1959, striving to complete it half a year ahead of the original plan. Gao Zhi proposed to initially complete the Tolstoy Selected Works within the next five years. Ye Junjian plans to translate several sets of selected works on children's and juvenile literature within five years. Ge Baoquan also strives to translate 2,500 to 3,000 lines of poetry by next year, and also to research and organize the historical materials of early and "May Fourth" period translations of Russian literature in China, and at the same time to study the relationship between Chinese and Russian writers since the eighteenth century.

    外国文学工作者要努力介绍国外优秀作品
    引“水”运“肥”滋润我国文学“禾苗”
    新华社12日讯　首都外国文学工作者11日集会座谈发展文学翻译工作的问题，并分别提出个人的跃进规划。座谈会上先后发言的有邵荃麟、曹靖华、李健吾、卞之琳、朱葆光、金克木、高植、叶君健、陈冰夷、戈宝权等。
    邵荃麟的发言说，介绍外国作品的总规划应该和每个外国文学工作者的个人规划相结合，规划中应该照顾到古典作品和现代作品、文学作品和理论作品、长篇和短篇等各方面，不可偏废；同时还要注意外国文学作品的节译工作，以满足普及工作的需要。
    曹靖华提出，外国文学工作者们应该像农民创造丰产条件一样，引“水”运“肥”，把外国文学中有用的“水”引到中国来，滋润我国文学的“禾苗”，争取社会主义文学大丰收。曹靖华说：在文学工作大跃进的巨浪中，外国文学工作者要来个译风大跃进，使翻译作品易于为广大读者接受。
    很多外国文学工作者们在发言中都提出，要争取在外国文学工作的数量和质量上都来一个大跃进。卞之琳计划今年完成莎士比亚的悲剧“李尔王”“麦克佩斯”的研究论文两篇，连同以前已经完成的两大悲剧（“哈姆雷特”、“奥赛罗”）的论文，准备在明年整理编成“莎士比亚四大悲剧论”一书。李健吾计划到1959年，争取比原计划提前半年时间完成莫里哀喜剧集。高植提出在今后五年内初步完成托尔斯泰选集。叶君健计划在五年内能翻译出几套有关少年和儿童文学方面的选集。戈宝权也争取到明年能翻译出二千五百到三千行诗；并且要研究整理中国早期和“五四”时期翻译俄国文学的史料，同时要研究十八世纪以来中国作家和俄国作家之间的关系。
