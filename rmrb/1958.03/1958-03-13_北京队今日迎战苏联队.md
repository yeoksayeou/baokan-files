    Beijing Team to Face Soviet Team Today
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Soviet football team will play its second match in Beijing this afternoon at the Xiannongtan Stadium. Today, the Beijing football team will face the Soviet team.
    The Soviet team's lineup today is completely different from the one against the "August 1st" team yesterday. Even so, this lineup is still very strong. Right winger Tatushin is fast and has a powerful shot; he is an old forward in the Soviet national team. Center forward Gusarov is a good scorer; he scored five goals alone in the match against the Shanghai Red Team. Left winger Kovalev poses a great threat, and defender Maslenkin is also very calm and steady.

    北京队今日迎战苏联队
    本报讯　苏联足球队今天下午将在先农坛体育场作来北京后的第二场比赛。今天迎战苏联队的是北京足球队。
    苏联队今天的阵容和昨天对“八一”队的完全不同。虽然如此，这次阵容仍然是很强的。右翼塔图辛速度快、脚头硬，是苏联国家队的老前锋，中锋古萨洛夫是个射门好手，在对上海红队一战，他就独建五功，左翼科瓦列夫给人威胁很大，后卫马斯莲金也很沉着稳健。
