    Crying for Mr. Cheng Yanqiu
    Xun Huisheng
    At seven o'clock in the morning on March 10th, I was still dreaming when I suddenly heard someone calling me, saying, "Mr. Cheng has passed away." I groggily asked, "What, Mr. Cheng is dead, really?" It took me two or three minutes to regain my senses after hearing that.
    I hurriedly got out of bed and went to the Beijing Hospital without even washing my face. I burst into tears when I saw Mr. Cheng's body. Then I went to the Cheng's home and comforted Mrs. Cheng. I went back to the Beijing Hospital at half past three in the afternoon and watched the body of my old brother of over forty years being placed in the coffin, because I felt at ease only when I saw that.
    Looking back, Mr. Cheng and I had been performing together in society for forty years. During the long period before liberation, we lived a painful life due to the feudal rule and the rule and oppression of the reactionary Kuomintang. For forty years, Mr. Cheng worked hard to persevere in theatrical work, humbly studied, and finally created the Cheng style singing, becoming a unique school.
    Mr. Cheng's family was poor in his childhood. In order to make a living, he suffered oppression and pain. Therefore, most of the dramas he created were about the persecution and oppression of women in the old society. During the period when the enemy and puppet occupied Beijing, Mr. Cheng was persecuted and humiliated by Japanese secret agents. He angrily stopped performing and lived a hard life in the rural suburbs of Beijing. This further strengthened his hatred for the old society.
    After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the status of actors was unprecedentedly improved. Thanks to the government and the Party's emphasis on and cultivation of Peking Opera, Peking Opera developed unprecedentedly. Mr. Cheng engaged in Peking Opera performance and research with unparalleled joy, and more actively and consciously responded to the call of the Party and the government. Under the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, he unreservedly passed on his forty years of stage experience and insights to the second generation. Unfortunately, he passed away before his wishes were fulfilled.
    I remember that on New Year's Day in 1932, when Mr. Cheng accepted my eldest son, Lingxiang, as his disciple at the Fengzeyuan Restaurant outside Qianmen, he excitedly said to everyone, "I am starting to accept disciples!" How humorous and humble this sentence is! When we worship a teacher, we always say to the teacher, "Please enlighten me!" Mr. Cheng's words reflect his humble, sincere, and serious character. The reason why I let Lingxiang become his disciple is because he can seriously and patiently teach disciples. Another memorable thing is that from that New Year's Day, Mr. Cheng changed his name to "Yanqiu" instead of "Yanqiu." He said that since he had accepted disciples and became a teacher, he should not use "Yan" anymore.
    Under the leadership of the Party, Mr. Cheng studied opera art, actively participated in learning, approached the organization, and sought progress, setting a good example for our older actors and young actors. This is what all our actors should learn from him.

    哭程砚秋先生
    荀慧生
    3月10日早上七点钟我还在梦里，忽然听到有人叫我，说：“程先生病故了。”我迷迷糊糊地问：“什么，程先生去世了，真的么？”我听了以后有两三分钟才恢复了知觉。
    我忙乱地起床，来不及洗脸便到北京医院去，一见程先生的遗体我便痛哭起来。接着我又去程家，安慰了程夫人。等到下午三时半我又去北京医院，看着相处四十多年的老弟兄入殓，因为我总觉着这样才安心。
    回想我和程先生四十年来一同在社会上献艺，在解放前的长时期内，由于封建统治和反动国民党的统治和压迫，过着痛苦的日子。四十年来，程先生坚苦奋斗坚持戏剧工作，虚心研究，终于创出了程腔，独成一派。
    程先生幼年家中贫困，为了生活，受尽压迫和痛苦，所以在他的创作的戏剧里，大多是表演妇女在旧社会所受的迫害和压迫。在敌伪占领北京时期，程先生曾受日本特务的迫害和侮辱，愤而罢演，在京郊农村过着艰苦的生活。这就更增强了他对旧社会的憎恨。
    1949年北京解放以后，在党和毛主席的领导下，演员的地位空前提高了，由于政府和党对京剧的重视和培养，京剧空前发展起来，程先生以无比愉快的心情从事京剧演出和研究的工作，更积极地自觉地响应党和政府的号召，在百花齐放百家争鸣的政策下，把他的四十年来的舞台经验和心得，毫无保留地传授给第二代，不幸在他的志愿没有完成前竟逝世了。
    记得在1932年元旦那天，程先生在前外丰泽园饭庄，收我的长子令香作弟子的时候，曾兴奋地对大家说：“我开蒙收徒弟了！”这句话是多么幽默而又谦虚呢？我们在拜师的时候，总是对老师说：“您给开蒙吧！”从程先生的话里，就反映出他的谦虚、诚恳认真的性格。我所以让令香拜他为师，也就因为他能认真耐心地教弟子。更有一件可以回忆的事，就是从那年元旦起，程先生便改名“砚秋”而不用“艳秋”了。他表示既然收了徒弟，作了老师，便不要用“艳”了。
    程先生在党的领导下钻研戏曲艺术，积极参加学习，靠近组织，要求进步，给我们老年演员和青年演员们作了一个好榜样，这是我们全体演员应该向他学习的。
