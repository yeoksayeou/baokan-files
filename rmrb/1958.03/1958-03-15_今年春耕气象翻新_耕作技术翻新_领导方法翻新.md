This Year's Spring Plowing Shows a New Look
    Farming Technology Renewed  Leadership Methods Renewed

    Debate Promotes Technological Reform in Guangdong

    (Our dispatch) The method of "great blooming, great contending, great debate" has promoted the reform of farming technology in many counties, townships, and communes in Guangdong Province. In the current spring plowing, the adoption of improved varieties, early planting, and sparse sowing to cultivate strong seedlings have been widely implemented.

    In order to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production and first ensure a bumper harvest of early rice, Guangdong Province requires a revolutionary leap forward in farming technology. However, some ideological obstacles were encountered in the promotion of technological reform this year. Some cadres and masses did not distinguish between the achievements and shortcomings of past technological reforms as the relationship between ten fingers and one finger, believing that technological reform had shortcomings and was not feasible. Some people were afraid of difficulties and trouble, thinking that with irrigation and fertilizer, a bumper harvest could be guaranteed, and there was no need to implement technological reform.

    In order to clear away these ideological obstacles, many places held special meetings at the township and commune levels before the spring plowing preparation work to conduct great blooming, great contending, and great debate on the issue of farming technology reform. Chao'an and Chenghai counties held county-wide meetings and technical training classes, focusing on various technical reform measures for spring plowing to carry out special blooming and debate. Dianpu Commune in Xian'an Township, Huilai County, clarified the truth about the so-called yield reduction caused by changing from shoveling seedlings to pulling seedlings in the debate. In 1956, among the 1,200 mu of paddy fields in the whole commune that used pulled seedlings, 70% increased production, and 30% decreased production, but the reason for the reduction in production was not due to the change from shoveling seedlings to pulling seedlings, but because the irrigation was not well repaired, the base fertilizer was insufficient, and the seedling management was poor. In 1957, a complete reversal to the recovery of shoveling seedlings resulted in a reduction of 42 catties of grain per mu.

    After the debate, a vigorous atmosphere of marching towards technology appeared in many counties and townships. The spring sowing work in Xian'an Township, Huilai County, was more than ten days earlier than in previous years, and the "Nante" improved variety was fully promoted. Most of the shoveling seedlings were changed to pulling seedlings, and sparse sowing and combined seedling fields were fully implemented, and the base fertilizer was increased by more than double than in the past. After the debate in various townships and communes in Panyu County, the county's sowing work was completed 20 days ahead of schedule, and improved varieties were widely promoted. After criticizing the argument that "this year, irrigation is well repaired and there is a lot of fertilizer, so production will increase even if technology is not emphasized" and other arguments that canceled technological reform in Maba Township, Qujiang County, production teams and communes, and communes and township party committees all established "timed, quality, and quantity" contracts at all levels to ensure the implementation of technological reform.

    Use Experimental Fields to Promote Agricultural Leap Forward in Jiangsu

    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th) A great leap forward in agricultural technology is an important feature of spring plowing production in Jiangsu Province this year. The Xuhuai area, where farming has always been relatively extensive, will convert two million mu of dry land to rice cultivation this year. At the same time, strict and meticulous farming requirements have also been set for various crops. Xuzhou and Huaiyin prefectures are widely promoting sweet potato warm bed seedling cultivation this year, and a large number of technicians have been trained. In cotton-growing areas, nutritional pots and square seedling methods will be widely promoted this year. More than 30,000 county and township cadres in the province have cultivated more than 60,000 mu of experimental fields. Through experimental fields, they systematically research and experiment on the cultivation techniques of various crops, leading the masses to boldly leap forward in production technology.

    Various new types of agricultural implements are particularly popular. This year, the province will promote 100,000 double-wheeled double-share plows. More than 50,000 new agricultural implements such as seeders, small cultivators, rice transplanters, and rice threshers are being rushed to manufacture and transfer.

    Improving Farming Technology Forms a Climax in Fujian

    (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 14th) The busy season of spring plowing and sowing has arrived in Fujian. An unprecedented busy scene of rushing to sow, rushing to dissolve fields, rushing to repair irrigation, and rushing to accumulate fertilizer has appeared everywhere in the province. More than 90,000 completed water conservancy projects have begun to be used on a large scale to store water and divert water to irrigate spring fields ahead of schedule. Tens of thousands of fertilizer accumulation teams in the province are still stepping up fertilizer accumulation and delivery.

    With the arrival of the busy spring plowing season, a climax of improving farming technology has also formed in various places. In areas where rice seedlings have been transplanted, mud and salt water seed selection, making combined seedling fields, etc., generally account for 80% to 100% of the total. To adapt to the needs of technological reform, various counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives are holding various technical training classes like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

    Careful Farming and Early Planting in Zhejiang

    (Special Dispatch from our newspaper and Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 14th) Early plowing and early sowing are common in various parts of Zhejiang Province this year. The Wenzhou area has sown the first batch of early rice seeds, and the Hangjiahu area has begun to sow continuous cropping early rice. In spring sowing, various places universally adopt semi-dry seedling fields and anti-freeze seedling fields to cultivate strong seedlings and prevent seedling rot.

    In this year's spring sowing, careful farming, matching of improved varieties, seed selection and soaking, and seedling field management are also better than last year. Many agricultural cooperatives have selected cold-resistant, drought-resistant, and wind-resistant improved varieties, and technical appraisals and inspections have been carried out at every stage of spring sowing. Cadre experimental fields in Taizhou, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and other areas are using advanced technology for spring sowing.

    At present, technical training classes and workshops are being held everywhere.

    Simao Sets Out Ten Technical Measures in Yunnan

    (Our dispatch) Yunnan Daily News: Simao Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has begun spring plowing preparation on the basis of a great leap forward in irrigation and fertilizer accumulation.

    In order to win the battle of spring plowing, ensure a 33% increase in grain production in the region this year, and completely change the backward situation of farming technology in the area, the CPC Simao Prefectural Committee proposed ten technical measures for spring plowing production at the recent meeting of county party committee secretaries. The main contents are: 1. Improve the farming system and advance planting. 2. Reasonable deep plowing, leveling and fine harrowing. It is required that fields for grain cultivation be plowed six or seven inches deep, and dry land be plowed five or six inches deep. Sugarcane fields should not be shallower than eight inches. 3. Apply fertilizer according to the field and topdressing according to the seedlings. For high-yield paddy fields in the inland, apply 4,000 catties of fertilizer per mu (calculated by fine fertilizer), 8,000 catties of fertilizer for medium-yield fields, and 12,000 catties of fertilizer for low-yield fields, with base fertilizer accounting for 80%. In border area land reform areas, apply 3,000 catties, 5,000 catties, and 7,000 catties of fertilizer per mu according to high, medium, and low yields respectively. Apply 20,000 catties of fertilizer per mu of sugarcane and cotton. 4. Strengthen the feeding and management of draught animals, speed up fattening, and ensure that draught animals are fat and strong. 5. Sow according to the field and cultivate strong seedlings. 6. Reasonable close planting of paddy fields. 7. Eliminate floating seedlings and missing seedlings, and thin and replant seedlings in mountainous areas. 8. Strengthen inter-tillage, hoeing and weeding more. 9. Eliminate low-yield fields below 400 catties and low-yield land below 200 catties. 10. Require that each household in the inland have a wheelbarrow before March 15th, and each five households have a cattle (horse) cart before the end of March to ensure the victory of the spring plowing campaign.

    今年春耕气象翻新
    耕作技术翻新  领导方法翻新
    大辩论促进技术改革广东
    本报讯　大鸣大放大辩论的方法，推动了广东省许多县、乡、社耕作技术的改革，在当前春耕中，选用良种、早播、疏播育壮秧等技术措施已被普遍采用。
    广东各地为了争取农业生产大跃进，首先保证早稻丰收，要求耕作技术来一个革命性的大跃进。但是，今年在推广技术改革中遇到一些思想障碍。有些干部和群众对过去技术改革的成绩和缺点，没有分清这是十个指头和一个指头的关系，认为技术改革有缺点，行不通；有些人怕困难怕麻烦，以为有了水利和肥料，就可以保证丰收了，不必再实行技术改革。
    为了扫清这些思想障碍，在备耕工作之前，许多地方都以乡、社为单位召开专门的会议，对耕作技术改革问题，进行大鸣大放大辩论。潮安和澄海两县举行了全县性的会议和技术训练班，集中春耕的各项技术改革措施开展专题的鸣放和辩论。惠来县仙庵乡点埔社在辩论中查明了所谓铲秧改拔秧减产的真象。1956年全社用拔秧的一千二百亩田中，七成增产，三成减产，但减产原因不是因铲秧改拔秧，而是水利没修好，基肥未施足，秧苗管理不善。1957年全面倒退恢复铲秧，亩产就减少四十二斤谷。
    经过辩论后，许多县乡出现了向技术大进军的蓬勃朝气。惠来县仙庵乡的春播工作比往年提早了十多天，全面推广了“南特”良种，大部分铲秧改拔秧，全面实行疏播和合式秧田，基肥比过去增加一倍多。番禺县各乡社经过辩论后，全县的播种工作已提前二十天完成，并普遍推广了良种。曲江县马坝乡批判了“今年水利修好肥料多，不讲技术也增产”等等取消技术改革的论调以后，生产队和社、社和乡党委都层层订立了“定时、定质、定量”的合同，保证贯彻实行技术改革。
    用试验田推动农业跃进江苏
    据新华社南京14日电　农业技术上大跃进，是今年江苏省春耕生产的重要特点。耕作一向比较粗放的徐淮地区，今年要将二百万亩旱地改种水稻，同时，对各种作物还订出了精耕细作的要求。徐州和淮阴两个专区今年普遍推广甘薯温床育苗，大批技术员已经训练好了。棉田地区今年将大量推行营养钵育苗和方形育苗法。全省三万多个县、乡干部培育了六万多亩试验田，他们通过试验田对各种作物的栽培技术作系统的研究和试验，带领群众在生产技术上大胆跃进。
    各种新式农具特别受到欢迎。今年全省要推广十万部双轮双铧犁。五万多部播种机、小型耕耘机、插秧机、打稻机等新式农具正在赶制和调运中。
    改进耕作技术形成高潮福建
    据新华社福州14 日电　春耕播种大忙季节已经来到福建。全省到处出现了赶播种、赶溶田、赶修水利、赶积肥的空前繁忙景象。完工的九万多处水利工程，已大规模地提前开始用来蓄水、引水灌溉春田。全省几万个积肥专业队，仍在加紧积肥和送肥。
    随着春耕大忙的到来，各地改进耕作技术的高潮也已形成。在已经插秧的地区，泥盐水选种、作合式秧田等一般都占总数80％到100％。适应技术改革的需要，各地县、区、乡和农业社都在像雨后春笋般地举办各种技术训练班。精耕细作早耕早播浙江
    本报特约新华社杭州14日电　浙江省各地今年普遍早耕早播。温州地区已播了第一批早稻种籽，杭嘉湖地区开始播种连作早稻。春播中各地普遍采用半旱秧田、防冻秧田培育壮秧和防止烂秧。
    今年春播中，精耕细作、良种搭配、选种浸种、秧田管理也比去年好。许多农业社粒选了耐寒耐旱耐风的良种，春播中每一环节都作了技术鉴定，检查验收。台州、温州、金华等地区干部试验田采用先进技术进行春播。
    目前各地正普遍举办技术训练班、讲习班。
    思茅订出十项技术措施云南
    本报讯　云南日报消息：云南省思茅专区在水利积肥大跃进的基础上，开始了春耕准备。
    为赢得春耕战役的胜利，保证全区今年粮食增产33％，彻底改变区内耕作技术落后的情况，中共思茅地委在最近召开的县委书记会议上提出了春耕生产的十项技术措施，主要内容是：一、改进耕作制度，提前栽插。二、合理深耕，整平耙细。要求种粮食的田犁六、七寸深，地犁五、六寸深。甘蔗地不浅于八寸。三、看田施肥，看苗追肥。内地高产田地每亩施肥（以精肥计算）四千斤，中产田地施肥八千斤，低产田地施肥一万二千斤，基肥占80％。边疆土改区分别按高、中、低产分别施肥三千斤、五千斤、七千斤。甘蔗、棉花每亩施肥二万斤。四、加强耕畜饲养管理，加紧催膘，保证耕畜肥壮。五、看田下种，培育壮秧。六、稻田合理密植。七、消灭漂秧缺塘，山地间苗补苗。八、加强中耕，多薅多锄。九、消灭四百斤以下的低产田和二百斤以下的低产地。十、要求内地在3月15日以前、边疆在3月底以前，做到每户一张手推车，3月底以前达到每五户一张牛（马）车，以保证春耕战役的胜利。
