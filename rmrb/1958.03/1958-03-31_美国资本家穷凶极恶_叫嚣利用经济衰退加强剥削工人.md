Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 29th: According to TASS, American financial and industrial figures and the bourgeois newspapers that reflect their views are openly clamoring to use the deepening American economic recession to attack the interests of the working people and intensify their exploitation. Davis, the head of a large American machine manufacturing company, shamelessly calculated this way, and he recently expressed the hope that the recession could be used to make "industry more efficient and more vibrant."

Hall, chairman of "Kroger Company," the largest commercial and industrial company in the United States, actually believes that the employment rate not long ago was "too high." He said: "Without a certain unemployment rate, there will be no normal conditions in the labor market."

In addition to these arguments, some people are openly clamoring for an attack on workers' wages. "Fortune" magazine wrote that when businessmen say the economic recession is a "healthy phenomenon," "they mostly mean that the recession can stop the continuous rise in wages."

The famous American bourgeois economist Slichter, at a meeting of factory owners in Cleveland in early March, taught these factory owners how to use this economic recession as an opportunity to intensify the exploitation of workers and launch new attacks on trade unions. He said, "The current economic recession gives factory owners an excellent opportunity to revise labor policies," that is, to infringe upon the basic rights of trade unions.

    美国资本家穷凶极恶
    叫嚣利用经济衰退加强剥削工人
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社纽约29日讯：美国金融工业界人士和反映他们的看法的资产阶级报刊公开叫嚷，要利用美国经济日益加深的衰退来进攻劳动人民的利益和加剧对他们的剥削。美国一家大机器制造公司的首脑戴维斯无耻地打着这种算盘，他最近就曾表示希望，可以利用衰退把“工业搞得更有效率、更有生命力。”
    美国最大一家商业——工业公司“克罗格公司”董事长霍尔竟然认为不久以前的就业率“太高”了。他说：“如果没有一定的失业率，劳动市场也就不会有正常的条件。”
    除了这些论调外，还有人公开叫嚷向工人的工资进攻。“幸福”杂志写道，当商人们说经济衰退是一种“健康的现象”的时候，“他们多半是指衰退可以制止工资的不断上升。”
    美国著名的资产阶级经济学家斯里契特3月初在克里夫兰工厂主的会议上曾经教导这些工厂主们如何利用这次经济衰退的机会，来加紧剥削工人并对工会发动新的进攻。他说，“目前的经济衰退给予工厂主以修改劳动政策”，即侵犯工会的基本权利的“绝好的机会”。
