Simple Rural Conference Call Promotes Production
Xushui County Has Modern Leadership Tools

(Our newspaper's Baoding dispatch, March 24th) China's first set of simple rural conference call system has been created by postal and telecommunications workers in Xushui County, and has been installed and put into use in various townships. The timely emergence of the simple rural conference call has played a huge role in promoting agricultural production in Xushui County.

The simple rural conference call in Xushui County is based on the establishment of telephone connections in all townships throughout the county. It utilizes the telephones and radio receivers in each township and modifies them using telephone lines. The modified radio receivers and telephone equipment can still be used as usual when telephone conferences are not being held. The simple conference call equipment only requires the installation of a few simple components between the telephone and radio receiver. When a telephone conference is held, it is connected to the telephone and radio receiver with a plug, allowing simultaneous listening and speaking. This set of simple conference call equipment was researched and created by Wang Yingbang, director of the Xushui County Post and Telecommunications Bureau, along with postal workers Chen Huanchun and Ren Guorui, with the support and encouragement of the Xushui County Party Committee. By fully utilizing existing machinery and equipment, the entire county's twenty-five townships only spent over 500 yuan to purchase over one hundred switches, terminals, and other telecommunications parts, and one hundred meters of atomic wire for modification. At the same time, due to the simplicity of the modification and installation, and the active efforts of postal and telecommunications workers, this set of simple conference call equipment, spread throughout the county, took only five days from creation to installation.

The creation and installation of the simple rural conference call in Xushui County has played a significant role in promoting agricultural production throughout the county. After its installation, county-level production leadership departments have used it to hold more than twenty conferences, promptly conveying leadership intentions to township, commune, and production team cadres. During the recent spring planting, the Xushui County Party Committee used telephone conference reports to promptly summarize many good experiences and promote them to the entire county on the spot. During the Spring Festival, the Xushui County Party Committee also used the conference call to lead cadres in various townships in a major debate on whether or not to take a holiday. With the conference call, the County Party Committee has also gained more timely grasp of the situation than before. In the past, it would take four days to collect the production situation of the entire county, but now a telephone reporting meeting can obtain the situation of the same day. The conference call also helped the leadership further overcome bureaucracy. Since Xushui County has had the conference call, paperwork has been reduced by 70%, and reports have been reduced by half. Replacing assembly meetings with telephone conferences has also greatly reduced the work delays caused by meetings for township and commune cadres.

Currently, relevant departments in Hebei Province are holding an on-site meeting in Xushui County to promote the experience of Xushui County in modifying rural conference calls to various counties. Counties such as Anxin and Dingxing, which have learned better, have already installed rural conference calls. Relevant departments in Henan, Liaoning and other provinces have also called and sent people to Xushui to visit and learn from this experience.

    简易农村会议电话推动生产
    徐水县有了现代化的领导工具
    本报保定24日电　我国第一套简易农村会议电话，已为徐水县邮电职工们创造出来，并已在各乡安装使用。简易农村会议电话的适时出世，对徐水县的农业生产，发挥了巨大的促进作用。
    徐水县的简易农村会议电话是在全县乡乡通电话的基础上，利用各乡的电话机、无线电收音机并借用电话线路改装使用的。改装后的无线电收音机和电话设备，在不开电话会议时仍可照旧使用。简易会议电话只给电话机和收音机之间装配了几个简单的机件，在开电话会议时用插头和电话机、收音机联接起来，便能同时听话和发言。这套简易的会议电话设备，是在中共徐水县委会的支持鼓舞下，由徐水县邮电局长王应邦和邮局职工陈焕春、任国瑞一起钻研创造的；由于充分利用了旧有的机器和设备，全县二十五个乡，只花了五百多元钱购买了一百多只开关、接线柱等电讯零件和一百公尺原子线就改装好。同时由于改装架设简单和邮电职工的积极努力，这套遍布全县的简易会议电话设备，从创造到装好，只用了五天的时间。
    徐水县简易农村会议电话的创造和安装，对促进全县的农业生产起了很大作用。安装起来后，县级的生产领导部门曾使用它召开过二十多次会议，及时地将领导意图传达给乡、社和生产队的干部。在最近的春播当中，中共徐水县委曾利用电话会议的汇报，及时总结了许多好经验，当场向全县推广。春节时，中共徐水县委还利用会议电话领导各乡干部进行了一次应否歇年的大辩论。有了会议电话，县委对情况的掌握也较前及时了。过去全县的生产情况四天后才能要上来，现在开一次电话汇报会，就能要到当天的情况。会议电话还帮助领导机关进一步克服了官僚主义。徐水县自从有了会议电话，文牍较前减少了70％，表报减少了一半。用电话会议代替集合开会，乡社干部开会误工也大大减少了。
    现在，河北省的有关部门正在徐水县召开现场会议，向各县推广徐水县改装农村会议电话的经验。学习较好的安新、定兴等县，农村会议电话已经安装好。河南、辽宁等省的有关部门，也打电话和派人来徐水参观学习这一经验。
