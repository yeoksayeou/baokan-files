Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th, TASS dispatch: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council will hold its regular meeting in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, from March 11th to 13th this year.

According to the official statements of the military and political leaders of the SEATO member states, primarily the United States, this meeting will formulate plans to strengthen the activities of this aggressive military and political bloc. The SEATO Council meeting, following closely on the heels of the NATO Council and the Baghdad Pact Council meetings, and the nature of the issues to be discussed at this meeting, all indicate that the imperialist bloc is attempting to maintain and intensify international tension.

To this end, TASS is authorized to issue the following statement:

The Manila meeting of representatives from the eight SEATO member states—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, the Philippines, and Pakistan—is being convened under the highly significant circumstances of millions of well-meaning people resolutely demanding a halt to the arms race, an end to the "Cold War," and a timely path towards peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. The people of the world oppose plans for new devastating wars; they demand to live and work in peace, without worrying about their future or the fate of their homeland. The call for direct negotiations between East and West to build the necessary trust between countries with different social systems has today become a truly universal demand.

Recently, the idea of fighting for peace and peaceful coexistence was expressed in the special resolution unanimously adopted by the Twelfth Session of the UN General Assembly. Leaders of many countries in Europe and Asia are deeply concerned about the fate of the world and oppose the aggressive bloc's attempts to intensify preparations for nuclear-rocket warfare. The Soviet government, representing the will of the entire Soviet people, recently put forward concrete proposals to ease international tensions. The governments of many countries, including those participating in SEATO, are studying these proposals, which, as everyone knows, stipulate holding a summit meeting of national leaders in the near future to discuss pressing issues, and reaching agreements on these issues will help ease international tensions.

Colonial countries fabricate a communist "threat" and use new means to promote old colonial policies in Southeast Asia.

Under these circumstances, the steps taken by SEATO participating countries not only have nothing in common with the interests of consolidating peace, but on the contrary, will only intensify the international situation and undermine the principles of peaceful coexistence that form the basis of the historic resolutions of the Bandung Conference of twenty-nine Asian and African countries. Colonial countries attempt to use SEATO to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries, to maintain their economic and political position in the region, and to keep the people of these countries in a state of dependence. To cover up this interference, SEATO leaders plan to formulate a so-called anti-subversion plan for Southeast Asian countries at the Manila meeting.

However, it is clear to everyone that the "subversion" that the ruling groups in the United States and other SEATO participating countries usually refer to is the national liberation movement of the people of Southeast Asian countries and their struggle to get rid of the remnants of colonial oppression and consolidate national independence.

Even at the time of SEATO's establishment, there were attempts to include Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam within the scope of this bloc's activities, which violated the unanimously agreed upon Geneva Accords on Indochina, which stipulated that these countries should not participate in military blocs.

Imperialist countries use every opportunity, even within the Asian participating countries of SEATO, to support unstable political situations with the help of SEATO, in order to seek their own interests. To put pressure on Southeast Asian countries, joint and regional exercises of the armed forces of SEATO participating countries are also widely used.

The discussion of the situation in Indonesia at the last SEATO Council meeting in Canberra and the intention of some SEATO participating countries to discuss the current situation in Indonesia at the Manila meeting cannot but be seen as a crude interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. From all indications, other measures, such as large-scale naval exercises by SEATO, are also pursuing the same goal. Participating in that naval exercise were the US Seventh Fleet and the British Far East Fleet based in Singapore. These exercises are taking place near the Indonesian archipelago precisely at a time when rebellious separatists are engaged in the criminal act of splitting and undermining the unity of the Republic of Indonesia in Central Sumatra and North Sulawesi. It is also known that many SEATO member states directly support the rebels with arms and money. The frantic propaganda launched by SEATO countries' newspapers and radio stations against the legitimate government of Indonesia is also aimed at this. The colonial countries participating in SEATO use West Irian, a part of Indonesian territory illegally occupied by the Netherlands, as their military base. It is known that SEATO members Australia and the Netherlands recently concluded a special agreement on coordinating plans related to West Irian.

These actions once again show that the high-sounding words of fighting so-called "subversion" are merely a disguise for colonial countries, which are trying to implement old colonial policies in Southeast Asia by new means. Although SEATO member states intend to bring out the so-called "communist threat" again, things do not change because of this. This trick is not new. Under the guise of the hackneyed fabrication of the so-called communist "threat," the heads of SEATO attempt to whitewash their own foreign policy guidelines, and mislead public opinion, especially the public opinion of Asian countries, about their true intentions.

Colonial countries attempt to deploy nuclear weapons and rockets in some Asian countries through the Manila meeting.

From the statements of political and military leaders of SEATO member states, it can be seen that a strategic plan will be formulated at the Manila meeting, through which colonial countries intend to deploy nuclear weapons and rockets on the territory of some Asian countries. In this regard, the remarks of Philippine President Garcia are noteworthy. He advocated establishing rocket launching bases in Asian countries participating in SEATO, and especially welcomed the establishment of American rocket weapon bases in the Philippines. Some officials in Thailand have also made such remarks.

Judging from all aspects, it is impossible not to put pressure on the leaders of some Asian countries on this issue, because the colonial countries' plans contain the danger of a devastating war occurring in Asia, and these plans are resisted by the broad masses of Eastern countries. The people of Asia clearly remember that it was Japan, an Asian country, that became the first target range for dropping atomic bombs, and the Japanese people suffered the first heavy sacrifices from the use of atomic bombs. They firmly oppose the expansion of armaments and advocate banning the production and testing of weapons of mass destruction. The proposal to establish nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zones in Europe and Asia is gaining increasing support in European and Asian countries.

Some social figures and politicians in Asian participating countries of SEATO are also aware of the fatal consequences that the preparation for nuclear-rocket warfare in Asia will bring. The public in these countries is deeply disturbed, and this mood is not difficult to understand. Everyone knows that modern weapons have enormous power and a wide range of destruction. In this regard, even just launching rockets will not change the situation, because any rocket, regardless of its range, is suitable for use as a nuclear weapon. In essence, a war using rockets now is an atomic war with all its devastating consequences.

The imperialist countries' desire to strengthen SEATO is primarily related to the United States' intention to expand its network of strategic military bases abroad. This is how the Western countries' aggressive bloc intends to turn the territory of Asian SEATO member states into a springboard that will inevitably suffer a counter-attack against aggression. The allocation of roles is this: some countries provide money and military equipment, while others provide cannon fodder and territory as victims of nuclear counter-attacks.

The danger of a nuclear-rocket war in Asia is increasing due to this plan, especially considering that the American troops stationed in South Korea and Taiwan are already equipped with nuclear-tipped rockets, and American strategic air force planes carrying hydrogen bombs are conducting patrol flights in these areas of Asia.

If the decision to deploy nuclear weapons and rockets in some Southeast Asian countries is passed in Manila, it will undoubtedly further intensify international tensions and war preparations, which is precisely what the major powers leading SEATO are trying to achieve.

The Western countries' attempt to link the three aggressive blocs together is extremely harmful to the Asian countries of the Southeast Asia group.

The Western countries' plan to use the SEATO Council meeting in Manila to actually unite the three aggressive blocs of NATO, the Baghdad Pact, and SEATO cannot but cause serious concern among all peace-loving people. It is known that at the recent NATO Council meeting in Paris and the Baghdad Pact meeting in Ankara, there were attempts to unite these three blocs into a single whole.

Implementing this plan means turning SEATO into a complete appendage of the main aggressive treaty—NATO. According to SEATO, the joint actions of its member states require prior consultation. If the United States links SEATO and the Baghdad Pact with NATO, it will be possible to automatically extend the obligations undertaken by the NATO member states to the SEATO member states. In other words, Asian countries participating in SEATO will fall into a situation of greater dependence on imperialist countries after establishing contact with NATO, and will also begin to be responsible for the policies of the organizers of NATO. It must be considered that this step may involve these countries in conflicts in regions tens of thousands of kilometers away from them.

The plan to link the NATO bloc, the Baghdad Pact, and SEATO, like the very existence of these blocs, cannot but be considered a violation of the proposition of consolidating world peace and international security, that is, a violation of the original purpose of the establishment of the United Nations.

"US Aid" does not help the economic development of recipient countries, but intensifies their militarization.

The colonial countries are pushing their Asian partners in SEATO onto a path fraught with grave dangers. They completely ignore the urgent needs of these countries and make it impossible for these countries to solve the pressing problems of developing their national economies and improving the living standards of their residents. Indeed, SEATO leaders are trying to win over Asian countries with generous promises of economic welfare.

Asian countries that hoped to get more funds necessary for developing their own economies after participating in SEATO have deeply convinced that these promises cannot be fulfilled. Even SEATO Secretary-General Pote Sarasin admitted when talking about the intention of some SEATO participating countries in Manila to advocate expanding economic assistance that the reaction of the United States and the United Kingdom to this plan was "far from enthusiastic."

As for the much-publicized US "aid," everyone knows that it is primarily to intensify the militarization of some SEATO participating countries such as Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines. These countries have to use 60% to 70% of their national budgets for "defense." What did they get in exchange? Almost 85% of the funds provided by the United States to Thailand are used to pay for military materials and to pay American military advisors. At the same time, the condition for obtaining US "aid" is that Thailand has to directly or indirectly use more of its own funds for military purposes. This amount of money is equal to seven times the US dollars it has received in recent years.

Pakistani Finance Minister Amjad Ali powerfully illustrated the consequences of US "aid" for Pakistan. He said that the degree of Pakistan's economic dependence on the United States has grown beyond all expectations. The sooner Pakistan becomes self-reliant, the better it will be for the country. This is understandable. The huge non-productive expenditures of Asian countries participating in SEATO greatly delay their achievement of economic independence and increase the dependence of these countries on colonial countries.

It is now clear that the purpose and nature of the upcoming SEATO Council meeting in Manila cannot but cause serious anxiety among peace-loving people, because what they expect is not the intensification of war preparations in Asia, but actions to eliminate abnormal relations between countries. The vital interests of the people of all countries require that countries formulate their foreign policies based on the need to maintain and consolidate peace, rather than take actions that aggravate the danger of war. All this may help create the necessary conditions to ensure an important shift towards easing international tensions and peacefully resolving outstanding international issues.

The Soviet Union is in favor of concluding an Asian Collective Peace Treaty and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free peaceful region in Asia.

Based on the interests of peace and the security of the people of all countries, the Soviet Union firmly believes that to make a major improvement in the international situation and to establish the necessary trust between countries, it is necessary to establish a European and Asian collective security system to replace the existing military blocs, and it is necessary to consolidate and expand the Asian peaceful region. Concluding an Asian Collective Peace Treaty will be an important step in this regard.

The Soviet Union believes that the movement against the deployment of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons in Asian countries, which is being carried out in Asia, is of great significance.

It is known that the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested taking measures to stop the war propaganda conducted by some countries' newspapers and radio stations, which creates mutual distrust, suspicion, and hostility. Stopping the current war propaganda would make it impossible to poison relations between countries any further and would make the danger of war no longer escalate.

The Soviet government believes that in order to improve the international situation and establish trust between countries, it is of great, and it can be said, special significance to strive to develop equal trade ties between countries without any discrimination, and to expand scientific, technological, cultural, and sports contacts, and travel activities. There is no doubt that this kind of contact will not only bring economic and other benefits to the people, but will also promote mutual understanding between them.

The Soviet Union firmly believes that the people of all countries deeply hope to establish lasting peace and prevent military conflicts. It can be said with certainty that if all peace-loving countries oppose military measures aimed at preparing for nuclear-rocket warfare in a way that they consider feasible, then without a doubt, they themselves will make an invaluable contribution to the cause of peace.

Asian countries can and should, entirely in accordance with the wishes of the people of Eastern countries, establish a peaceful region free of nuclear weapons and rockets.

Judging from all aspects, the task of the SEATO Council meeting in Manila is to obstruct this.

In this regard, the Soviet leaders believe that it is necessary to urge the governments of the SEATO participating countries to pay attention: they must bear serious responsibility for their efforts to implement plans aimed at further exacerbating international tensions.

The interests of peace in the Southeast Asian region urgently require abandoning the deadly plans to prepare for nuclear-rocket warfare. Only by consolidating the peaceful region of Asia, establishing good-neighborly relations and friendly cooperation, rather than piecing together aggressive military blocs, can peace and security in this region be maintained and consolidated.

    东南亚侵略集团加紧备战活动
    妄图阻挠建立亚洲无核武器区
    塔斯社揭露马尼拉会议的阴谋
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科8日电：东南亚条约组织理事会将在今年3月11日至13日在菲律宾首都马尼拉举行例会。
    根据东南亚条约组织缔约国，首先是美国的军政领导人的正式声明来看，这次会议将拟定加强东南亚这个侵略性军事和政治集团的活动的计划。继北大西洋公约组织理事会和巴格达条约理事会会议之后紧跟着召开的东南亚条约组织理事会以及这次会议将要讨论的问题的性质，都表明帝国主义集团企图保持并加剧国际紧张局势。
    为此，塔斯社受权发表声明如下：
    东南亚条约组织八个缔约国——美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、菲律宾和巴基斯坦的代表的马尼拉会议是在这样一个非常重要的情势下召开的，即千百万善良的人坚决要求停止军备竞赛、终止“冷战”、及时走上和平共处和国际合作的道路。世界各国人民反对新的毁灭性战争的计划，他们要求过安静的生活和劳动，不为自己的未来、自己的家园的命运而担忧。希望东西方举行直接谈判以便建立不同社会制度国家的必要信任的要求，今天已经成为真正普遍的要求。
    最近时期，为和平与和平共处而斗争的思想在联合国大会第十二届会议一致通过的特别决议中得到了表现。欧亚两洲许多国家的领导人对世界的命运感到严重的不安，他们反对侵略集团企图加紧准备核武器—火箭武器战争的计划。苏联政府代表全体苏联人民的意愿，不久前在缓和国际紧张局势方面提出了具体的建议。许多国家的政府，其中包括东南亚条约组织参加国的政府正在对这些建议进行研究，大家知道，这些建议规定在最近的将来召开最高级国家领导人会议讨论一些刻不容缓的问题，就这些问题达成协议将会促使国际紧张局势趋向缓和。
    殖民主义国家捏造共产主义“威胁”，用新手段在东南亚推行老殖民政策。
    在这种情况下，东南亚条约集团参加国所采取的步骤，不但同巩固和平的利益毫无共同之处，相反地，只会促使国际局势尖锐化，破坏作为亚非二十九个国家万隆会议的历史性决议的基础的和平共处原则。殖民主义国家企图利用东南亚条约集团来干涉东南亚国家的内政，以维持它们在这个地区的经济和政治地位，使这些国家的人民继续处于依赖的地位。东南亚条约集团领导人为了掩饰这种干涉，打算在马尼拉会议上制定东南亚国家的所谓反颠覆活动的计划。
    但是，大家都很清楚，美国和东南亚条约组织其他参加国的统治集团通常所指的“颠覆活动”就是东南亚国家人民的民族解放运动以及他们为摆脱殖民主义压迫残余和巩固民族独立而进行的斗争。
    还在东南亚条约组织建立的时期，就有人力图把柬埔寨、老挝和南越列入这个集团的活动范围之内，这就破坏了一致同意的关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定，那一协定规定不使这些国家参加军事集团。
    帝国主义国家利用一切机会，甚至在东南亚条约组织的亚洲参加国内借助东南亚条约支持不稳定的政治局势，以便为自己谋利。为了对东南亚国家施加压力，还广泛地利用了东南亚条约组织参加国的武装部队的联合演习与区域性演习。
    在堪培拉举行的上次东南亚条约组织理事会会议上讨论印度尼西亚的局势和东南亚条约组织的某些参加国打算在马尼拉会议上讨论印度尼西亚目前局势问题都不能不看做是对印度尼西亚内政的粗暴干涉。从一切情况来看，其他一些措施，如：东南亚条约组织的大规模海军演习，也都是追求着同样的目的，参加那次海军演习的有美国的第七舰队和在新加坡设有基地的英国远东舰队。这种演习恰恰是在现在，当叛乱的分裂分子在中苏门答腊和北苏拉威西干着分裂、破坏印度尼西亚共和国的统一的罪恶勾当的时候，在印度尼西亚群岛附近举行的。大家也知道，东南亚条约组织的许多成员国都以军火和金钱直接支援叛乱者。东南亚条约组织国家的报刊和电台针对印度尼西亚的合法政府展开的疯狂宣传也以此为目的。参加东南亚条约组织的殖民主义国家利用被荷兰非法占据的、印度尼西亚领土的一部分——西伊里安作为自己的军事基地。大家知道，东南亚条约组织成员国澳大利亚和荷兰之间最近缔结了一项关于协调有关西伊里安的计划的专门协定。
    这些行动再一次说明：所谓向“颠覆活动”作斗争的冠冕堂皇的言词不过是殖民主义国家的掩饰手法而已，它们力图用新的手段在东南亚推行老殖民主义政策。虽然东南亚条约组织的成员国又打算搬出所谓“共产主义威胁”这种唬人的东西，然而事情并不因此而有所改变。这个手法并不新鲜。东南亚条约组织的头目们在所谓共产党“威胁”这种陈腐的捏造下，企图粉饰自己的外交政策方针，在他们的真正意图上迷惑舆论、首先是亚洲国家的舆论。
    殖民主义国家企图通过马尼拉会议在一些亚洲国家配置核武器和火箭武器。
    从东南亚条约组织成员国的政治领导人和军事领导人的言论中可以看出，在马尼拉会议上将要制定战略计划，殖民主义国家打算通过这种战略计划在一些亚洲国家的领土上配置核武器和火箭武器。在这方面，菲律宾总统加西亚的言论值得注意，他主张在参加东南亚条约组织的亚洲国家建立发射火箭武器的基地，并且特别欢迎在菲律宾设立美国火箭武器基地。泰国的一些官方人士也发表了这样的言论。
    从各方面来判断，在这个问题上，不对一些亚洲国家的领导人施加压力是不行的，因为殖民主义国家的计划包藏着在亚洲发生毁灭性战争的危险性，这些计划遭到东方国家广大群众的反击。亚洲人民很清楚地记得，正是日本这个亚洲国家成了投掷原子弹的第一个打靶场，而日本人民首先遭到使用原子弹的惨重牺牲。他们坚决反对扩充军备，主张禁止大规模毁灭性武器的生产和试验。在欧洲和亚洲建立无原子武器和氢武器地区的主张在欧亚各国得到越来越大的支持。
    东南亚条约组织的亚洲参加国的一些社会人士和政界人士也都意识到在亚洲准备核—火箭战争会带来致命的后果。这些国家的公众深感不安，这种心情是不难理解的。大家都知道，现代化武器具有巨大的威力，破坏和毁灭的范围很广阔。在这方面，即使是只发射火箭也不会使情况有所改变，因为任何火箭，不论其射程的长短，都适合于作为核武器来使用。实质上，在现在使用火箭的战争——就是带有一切毁灭性后果的原子战争。
    帝国主义国家想加强东南亚条约组织的企图，首先在军事方面是同美国想在国外扩大战略军事基地网的意图有关联的。西方国家侵略集团就是这样想把东南亚条约组织亚洲缔约国的领土变成必然会遭到反侵略回击的跳板。角色的分配是这样：一些国家出钱，供给军事装备，而另一些国家提供炮灰和领土作为核武器反击的牺牲品。
    亚洲核—火箭战争的危险性由于这种计划而越发增长，如果考虑到驻扎在南朝鲜和台湾的美国部队已经装备有核弹头火箭武器，而美国战略空军飞机携带氢弹在亚洲这些地区进行巡逻飞行的话。
    如果在马尼拉通过东南亚一些国家配置核武器和火箭武器的决定，那么无疑地会使国际紧张局势和战争准备进一步加剧，而这正是领导东南亚条约组织的大国所力图达到的。
    西方国家企图把三个侵略集团联结起来，这对东南亚集团亚洲国家危害极大。
    西方国家计划利用东南亚条约组织理事会马尼拉会议来把北大西洋公约、巴格达条约和东南亚条约这三个侵略性集团实际联合起来，这不能不引起全体爱好和平的人民的严重不安。大家知道，在不久前的北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议和巴格达条约安卡拉会议上就有人曾试图把这三个集团联合成一个统一的整体。
    实现这种计划意味着把东南亚条约组织彻底变为主要的侵略性条约——北大西洋公约的附属品。根据东南亚条约，它的成员国的联合行动需要经过预先的磋商，那么，美国把东南亚条约和巴格达条约跟北大西洋公约连在一起后，就有可能把北大西洋集团国家所承担的义务自动地扩大到东南亚条约组织成员国身上。换句话说，参加东南亚条约组织的亚洲国家同北大西洋公约组织建立联系之后，将陷于对帝国主义国家有更大的依赖性的境地，并且还将开始对北大西洋公约组织的组织者的政策负责任。不能不考虑到，这种步骤可能使这些国家卷入与它们相距几万公里以外的地区的冲突。
    把北大西洋集团、巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织连在一起的计划，同这些集团存在的本身一样，不能不认为是违反巩固世界和平和国际安全的主张的，也就是说，是违反联合国组织当初建立的宗旨的。
    “美援”无助于受援国的经济发展，而是加紧它们的军国主义化。
    殖民主义国家把东南亚条约组织中的亚洲伙伴推向包藏着严重危险的道路，它们完全无视这些国家的迫切要求，并且使这些国家丧失了解决发展民族经济和提高居民生活水平这些迫切问题的可能性。的确，东南亚条约集团领导人企图用经济福利方面的慷慨诺言使亚洲国家倒向自己一边。
    那些指望在参加东南亚条约组织之后可以得到更多的、为发展本国经济所必需的资金的亚洲国家已经深信这种允诺是无法兑现的。就连东南亚条约组织的秘书长朴·沙拉信在谈到东南亚条约组织的某些参加国在马尼拉打算主张扩大经济援助的意图时也承认，美国和英国对这种计划的反应是“远非热情的”。
    至于谈到大肆宣扬的美“援”，大家知道，它首先是要加紧像巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾这样一些东南亚条约组织参加国的军国主义化。这些国家不得不把60％到70％的国家预算用于“国防”。他们换取了一些什么呢？美国提供给泰国的资金几乎有85％用于支付军事物资和酬劳美国的军事顾问。同时获得美“援”的条件是：泰国不得不直接间接地把自己更多的资金用于军事用途，这笔钱等于近年来它所得到的美元的七倍。
    巴基斯坦财政部长阿姆贾德·阿里有力地说明了美“援”对巴基斯坦的后果。他说，巴基斯坦对美国经济依附的增长程度出乎一切预料，巴基斯坦自立得愈快，那么对国家就将愈好。这是可以理解的。参加东南亚条约组织的亚洲国家的非生产性开支如此庞大，这就大大地延缓了他们取得经济独立并增加了这些国家对殖民主义国家的依附。
    现在已经很明显，即将举行的东南亚条约组织理事会马尼拉会议的目的和性质不能不引起爱好和平的人民的严重不安，因为他们所期望的不是亚洲战争准备的加紧，而是期望采取某种行动来消除国与国之间不正常的关系。各国人民的切身利益要求各国本着维护和巩固和平的必要性来拟定本国的外交政策，而不是采取行动使战争危险加剧。这一切可能有助于创造必要的条件，保证朝着缓和国际紧张局势和和平解决恳而未决的国际问题的方向有一个重要的转变。
    苏联赞成缔结亚洲集体和平公约，建立亚洲无核武器的和平地区。
    苏联本着和平和各国人民安全的利益坚信：要使国际局势有重大的好转和建立国与国之间必要的信任，就必须建立欧洲和亚洲集体安全体系来代替现有的军事集团，就必须巩固和扩大亚洲和平地区。缔结亚洲集体和平公约将是这方面的重要步骤。
    苏联认为在亚洲所开展的反对在亚洲各国配置原子武器和氢武器的运动是具有重大意义的。
    大家知道，苏联政府曾多次建议采取措施停止一些国家的报纸和电台所进行的、产生互不信任、猜疑和敌意的战争宣传。停止现在所进行的战争宣传就会使得不能再毒化国与国之间的关系，就会使得战争的危险不再加剧。
    苏联政府认为，为了使国际局势健康化和建立国与国之间的信任，在各国之间毫无任何歧视地竭力发展平等的贸易联系以及扩大科学、技术、文化和体育联系、旅行活动等具有很大的、可以说是特别重大的意义。毫无疑问，这种接触不仅会给人民带来经济利益和其他利益，而且能促使他们之间达到互相谅解。
    苏联坚信，各国人民深切希望建立持久和平和防止军事冲突。可以有把握地说，如果一切爱好和平的国家都以它们认为切实可行的方式来反对加速旨在准备核—火箭战争的军事措施，那末毫无疑问，它们自己就将对和平事业作出难以估价的贡献。
    亚洲各国可以而且也应当完全根据东方各国人民的意愿，建立无核武器和火箭武器的和平地区。
    从各方面判断，东南亚条约组织理事会马尼拉会议的任务是要阻挠这一点的。
    在这方面，苏联领导人士认为必须促请东南亚条约组织参加国政府注意：由于它们力图实现旨在使国际紧张局势进一步尖锐化的计划，它们要负严重的责任。
    东南亚地区和平的利益要求迫切需要放弃准备核—火箭战争的致命的计划。只有巩固亚洲的和平地区、建立善邻关系和友好合作，而不是拼凑侵略性军事集团，才能维护和巩固这个地区的和平和安全。
