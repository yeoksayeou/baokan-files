The Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to purchase three million hedgehogs this year to extract more than 540,000 jin of oil for use in soap, lighting, and lubricants.

　　Using hedgehogs to extract oil was successfully tested by the Qixia County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in November last year. Each 100 jin of hedgehogs can produce four jin of oil. It is estimated that the province produces approximately 10 million hedgehogs annually. If all of them can be purchased and utilized, it could increase oil production by more than 1.8 million jin. Hedgehog skins can be used as medicinal materials and for export.

    刺猬榨油
    山东省供销社决定今年收购刺猬三百万只，榨取油脂五十四万多斤，供作肥皂、点灯和滑润剂用。
    用刺猬榨油，是栖霞县供销社去年11月份试验成功的，每百斤刺猬可出油四斤。估计全省年产刺猬约一千万只，如能全部收购和利用起来，可增产油脂一百八十多万斤。刺猬皮可以作药材和出口。
