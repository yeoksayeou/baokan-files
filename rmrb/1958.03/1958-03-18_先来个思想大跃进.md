    First, Let's Have an Ideological Great Leap Forward
    Jiang Junchen
    For scientific research to leap forward, there must first be an ideological leap forward. The ideological leap forward must be the prerequisite, and we must start with the ideological leap forward. This applies equally to both natural and social sciences. To have an ideological leap forward, in the fields of philosophy and social sciences, we must first solve the problem of "valuing the present over the past" proposed by Comrade Chen Boda. "The present" refers to today's social reality and the needs of today's country and society. Philosophy and social sciences must serve the current socialist cause and the Great Leap Forward in production. Secondly, should and can we adopt the mass line in social science research? I believe the answer is yes. The strength of philosophy and social science research is not only distributed throughout the country, but also scattered in various work positions. This is a characteristic of the philosophy and social science field. If we do not mobilize the strength of philosophy and social science workers across the country, if we do not break out of the circle of relying solely on research units, and if we do not fully unleash the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of philosophy and social science workers in all aspects, it will be impossible to achieve a Great Leap Forward in philosophy and social sciences. Thirdly, we must strengthen collaboration and coordination. Everyone agrees with this in words, as if the problem has been solved. But in reality, it has not been solved or not completely solved. When it comes to specific collaborative and coordination work in scientific research, some things just don't work. Therefore, we must eliminate departmentalism and emphasize collaboration and coordination. From the above three points, the ideological Great Leap Forward should be the foundation of the philosophical and social science Great Leap Forward.
    The second problem in the Great Leap Forward is planning. We don't have enough experience in how to plan philosophical and social science research. But one thing is certain: whether it is the planning of research units or the planning of individuals, it should be done more, faster, better, and more economically, and not less, slower, worse, and more wastefully. At the same time, individual research plans should mostly serve the needs of the country. In order to maximize the role of amateur research forces, philosophy and social science workers scattered in business departments and practical work positions should also formulate research plans. Of course, the requirements for research plans should be diverse for this part of the force. They can write books, write papers, write book reviews, or teach, lecture, give reports, talk about experiences, or introduce business situations. In short, they can formulate appropriate and progressive plans based on their different work situations and working conditions.
    In addition, there should be a plan for training cadres in the planning. Comrade Chen Boda said that we should learn while doing, which is a great encouragement to cultivating new forces and further strengthening the ranks of philosophy and social sciences. For this reason, there should also be a plan. This plan for training cadres should be made not only by all research units and institutions of higher learning, but also by business departments. The formulation of a plan for training cadres by business departments will undoubtedly promote the training of both red and expert cadres in their own departments.
    Third, to make a leap forward, we must consider the organizational issues of the philosophy and social science team. After the anti-rightist struggle and the ongoing rectification movement, the enthusiasm of social science workers has been greatly improved. However, how should this team be organized? It now appears that a variety of forms should be adopted, such as seminars, report meetings, lectures, and debates. In addition to these, there should also be societies and federations of various societies. With these diverse organizational forms, individual plans can naturally be combined with national plans.

    先来个思想大跃进
    姜君辰
    科学研究工作要跃进，首先要有思想跃进，要以思想跃进为前提，要从思想跃进入手。这无论对自然科学或社会科学来说同样是适用的。要思想跃进，在哲学社会科学方面，首先要解决陈伯达同志提出的“厚今薄古”的问题。“今”是指今天的社会实际，也是指今天国家和社会的需要。哲学社会科学必须为当前的社会主义事业服务，为生产大跃进服务。其次，搞社会科学要不要和能不能走群众路线呢？我认为，答案是肯定的。哲学社会科学研究的力量，不仅分布在全国，而且还散布在各方面的工作岗位上，这是哲学社会科学界的特点。如果不把全国的哲学社会科学工作者的力量发动起来，如果不打开单纯依靠研究单位的圈子，把各方面哲学社会科学工作者群众的积极性和创造性充分发挥出来，要想在哲学社会科学方面也来个大跃进，是不可能的。第三，要加强协作协调，这在口头上是谁都同意的，好像问题已经解决了。但是实际上并没有或者没有完全解决，一谈到科学研究中具体的协作协调工作，有些就行不通了。因此，必须打掉本位主义，强调协作协调。从上面三点来看，思想大跃进应该是哲学社会科学大跃进的基础。
    跃进中的第二个问题是规划问题。哲学社会科学研究的规划，究竟应该怎么做，目前经验还很不够。但是有一条是肯定的，不论研究单位的规划或者个人的规划都要多快好省，而不要少慢差费。同时，个人的研究规划，还应该做到大部分是服从国家需要的。为了尽量发挥业余的研究力量，散布在业务部门和实际工作岗位上的哲学社会科学工作者也应当订出研究规划。当然对这部分力量，研究规划的要求应该是多种多样的。他们可以写书、写论文、写书评，也可以教课、讲学、作报告、谈经验或介绍业务情况。总之，可以根据他们不同的工作情况、工作条件，订出适当而又跃进的规划。
    另外在规划中还要有培养干部的计划。陈伯达同志说要边干边学，这对培养新生力量和进一步壮大哲学社会科学队伍，是个巨大鼓舞。为此，也应当有个规划。这种培养干部的规划，不仅所有的研究单位和高等院校都要作，业务部门也要作。业务部门制订培养干部的规划，对于它们自己培养又红又专的干部必将起促进作用，这是无疑的。
    第三，要跃进就要考虑哲学社会科学队伍的组织问题。在反右派斗争以后和目前继续进行的整风运动中，社会科学工作者的积极性是大大提高了。但是，这支队伍怎样组织呢？现在看来，要采取多种多样的形式，搞座谈会，搞报告会，设讲座，开辩论会都可以。除此以外，还要有学会和各种学会的联合会等。有了这些多种多样的组织形式，也自然就可以把个人规划同国家规划结合起来。
