　　That delightful holiday time brought ten thousand visitors to the Summer Palace. Entire government offices arrived in packed trucks, young people entering the palace gates holding high their league flags. Happy families and groups arrived, the girls all wearing bright new clothes. The crowds pressed together, shoulder to shoulder. They walked along the Long Corridor and climbed up to the Hall of Dispelling Clouds. Officers posed for photographs around the bronze ox, and people clamored for draft beer in front of the Marble Boat. Volleyball enthusiasts cheered in the Hall for Listening to Orioles, and the lake supported hundreds and hundreds of yachts. Bathers thronged near the Pavilion of Knowing Spring, while a large accordion ensemble played in the Garden of Harmonious Interest. Along the mountain paths that overlook the scenery, countless footsteps wandered into a living painting. Only in the secluded, uninhabited area of the Back Lake did he clasp her soft hand. The flanking dragon scale pines seemed to watch with affection, and the maple leaves under the Pagoda of Many Treasures blushed red. Comfortable tea drinkers sat in wicker chairs, relieving the fatigue of a week's work, until the setting sun fell behind the Western Hills Pagoda, and suddenly there was no one in front of the jade towers and arched gates. At this time, the Summer Palace seemed to awaken from a dream. After a whole day of hustle and bustle, silence returned once more. Gardeners swept up fallen leaves and picnic debris, and the sound of pine trees, birds, and water echoed in concert again. The Summer Palace is admired by ten thousand people during the day, but it is far inferior to its quiet nights, when the lights of the Long Corridor illuminate the cypress forest and the moonlight dances on the gentle waves of the lake. In the open spaces, the moonlight poured down magnificently, while in the deep woods, the moonlight shone through the leaves of the trees. It was the still of night, when suddenly a clanging of machinery was heard. The wind blew it past the Dragon King Temple and the Long Bridge, and up to the Wisdom Sea cloud pine nests. It startled the owls in the treetops. Ah, what a disturbing sound to one's peaceful dreams! Clang, clang, clang, the Beijing dredger was hard at work. In an instant, the quiet garden transformed into a bustling construction site, a boiling construction site. Clang, clang, clang, this is our era. The motherland is under construction, with construction sites everywhere, even in the Summer Palace, in the dead of night. Clang, clang, clang, the lights on the Beijing dredger shone brightly. It was dredging the South Lake, turning the reed beds into a waterway, highlighting a western dam. At dawn, try walking along the six bridges of the West Dam, a true long dam, transplanted from West Lake. With scenery on all sides of the bridge, a true "Spring Dawn on the Long Dam," a visit to the Summer Palace is incomplete without coming here.

    颐和园
    徐迟那春秋佳丽的例假日，园中的游客有十万人。机关都开来满满几卡车，青年人高举团旗进宫门。来了欢乐的家庭和集体，姑娘都穿上鲜艳的新衣。人群彼此簇拥，接踵摩肩。走上长廊，登上排云殿。被摄影的军官围住铜牛，石舫前，人们争购生啤酒。排球健将鼓噪在听鹂馆，湖水将千百条游艇来负担。海浴场熙攘在知春亭旁，谐趣园中手风琴大合唱。沿着那了望风景的山路走，无数的步履走进画中游。只在后湖僻静无人处，他才握紧了她柔和的手。夹道的鱼鳞松为之含情脉脉，多宝塔下的枫叶涨红了脸。舒适的吃茶人坐在藤椅上，消除了一周来工作的疲劳，直到斜阳落到西山塔后，琼楼玉宇的牌楼前忽已无人。这时候，颐和园却如梦初醒，闹过一整天，寂静又重归。园丁扫落叶和野餐残纸，松涛，鸟声，水声重新协奏。白天的颐和园十万人赞赏，却远不如它幽静的夜间，当长廊灯光照亮柏树林，月光在湖心柔波上跳动。开阔处的月光富丽的浇下，林深处，月光从木叶间射过。这是万籁俱静的夜深时分，忽然传来了吭啷啷的机器声。风把它吹过龙王庙和长桥，又吹它上智慧海云松巢。它惊起了树梢上的猫头鹰，呵，多末扰人清梦的声音！吭啷啷吭啷啷吭啷啷北京号挖泥船在紧张工作。霎时间，幽静的园林变成喧闹的工地，沸腾的工地。吭啷啷吭啷啷吭啷啷，这就是我们的时代。祖国在建设，处处是工地，即使是颐和园，夜深人静时。吭啷啷吭啷啷吭啷啷，北京号挖泥船上灯光辉煌。它在疏浚南湖，要把芦苇地变成水波衬托出一条西堤。黎明里你试走上西堤六桥，真正的长堤，从西湖乔迁。桥上四面风景，真正长堤春晓，不到这里，不算到过颐和园。
