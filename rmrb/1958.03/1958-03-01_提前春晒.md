    Early Spring Salt Harvesting
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the staff and workers of the Changlu Tanggu Salt Bureau broke with convention and extracted the first batch of new salt for 1958 on the 23rd in a low-temperature climate of around 0 degrees Celsius.
    Salt production is still largely affected by natural conditions, but the salt workers are determined to overcome the elements and, following the bumper harvest of 1957, achieve another great leap forward. In mid-January, during the severe winter, they carried out various preparatory tasks such as pond preparation, tide intake, brine cultivation, and beach repair, changing the old practice of allowing brine to flow into the crystallization ponds only after the Spring Festival, thus advancing this year's spring salt harvesting by more than half a month compared to previous years. Currently, over 80% of the crystallization ponds have been filled with brine.
    Last year, the Changlu Tanggu Salt Bureau increased the production of crude salt by more than 420,000 tons, breaking historical records; this year, on the basis of fulfilling the state plan, it will further increase salt production by 565,000 tons.

    提前春晒
    据新华社讯　长芦塘大盐务局职工打破常规，在23日摄氏零度左右的低温气候下扒出了1958年的第一批新盐。
    盐业生产目前还在很大程度上受着自然条件的影响，但是盐工们决心战胜天时，继1957年大丰收后再来一个大跃进。1月中旬，他们在严寒的冬天，进行了整池、纳潮、养卤、修滩等各种准备工作，改变了以往在春节以后才让卤水流入结晶池的老作法，因而使今年春晒比往年提前了半个多月。现在，80％以上的结晶池已灌好了卤水。
    长芦塘大盐务局去年增产原盐四十二万多吨，打破了历史纪录；今年将在完成国家计划的基础上，再增产五十六万五千吨盐。
