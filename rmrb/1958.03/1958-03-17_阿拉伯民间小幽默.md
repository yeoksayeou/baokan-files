Arab Folk Humor

    A scholar went on a voyage by boat. He asked a sailor on the boat, "Do you know grammar?"
    "No," the sailor replied.
    "What a pity, half of your life is over," said the scholar.
    A little later, the boat struck a reef and began to sink. At this time, the sailor asked the scholar:
    "Can you swim?"
    "No," the scholar replied.
    "Finished, your whole life is over," the sailor said to him. (Xin De, translator)

    阿拉伯民间小幽默
    有一位学者乘船去游历。他问船上的一个水手说：“你懂文法吗？”
    “不懂”水手回答。
    “可惜啊，你的半生完了”。学者说。
    不一会儿，船触着暗礁，开始沉没了。这时水手问学者：
    “你会游泳吗？”
    “不会。”学者回答。
    “完了，你的一生都完了。”水手对他说。　（心得译）
