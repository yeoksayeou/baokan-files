    Sino-French Children's Grand Carnival
    Liu Men
    Spring brings many joyous festivals to the children of France. If Lent was a season of fasting and abstinence for believers in ancient times, it now brings three different festivals to children. The beginning of Lent is "Fat Tuesday" with pancakes and masks, the middle is "Mid-Lent" with costume parades, and the end is the two-week "Easter."
    As usual, "Mid-Lent" always falls on a Thursday, and Thursday is a holiday for French children. As usual, French children mostly wear costumes of various nationalities from ancient and modern times on this holiday and parade in the streets for fun. This year, in order to promote friendly relations between Chinese and French children, the France-China Friendship Association specially held a costume competition for a Sino-French children's grand carnival.
    The time was originally set for 2:45 p.m., but from 2:00 p.m. onwards, a large theater in the Place de la République in Paris was already crowded with children of different ages from China and France. They were all in high spirits to participate in this international competition. Their faces shone with joy.
    Amid the hustle and bustle, mothers were hiding in the corners of the auditorium, applying makeup and dressing their children in new clothes. Some were dressed as ancient knights, wearing armor and holding lances; some older brothers were dressed as dukes, and their younger sisters were dressed as duchesses; some were dressed as Robin Hood, fighting the rich and helping the poor, and some were dressed as the valiant Napoleon; some were dressed as Cossack cavalry, and some were dressed as Hawaiian dancers; still others wore national costumes from various regions of France, performing folk dances.
    But the vast majority of children were still wearing Chinese clothing. Some were dressed as high-ranking Qing Dynasty officials, and some were dressed as rural farmers; some wore costumes for the Yangko dance, with a small drum hanging on their chest; some wore long gowns and mandarin jackets, with melon-rind hats on their heads; and some were even dressed as new brides, holding flower fans to cover their faces shyly. Perhaps because some people were unable to distinguish clearly the costumes of various Eastern countries, some wore Japanese kimonos and Vietnamese robes, also claiming to be dressed as Chinese.
    More than two hundred innocent and lively children, wearing all kinds of colorful costumes, ran happily through the crowd, comparing and showing off their outfits. Many Chinese children were mixed with French children, talking and laughing together.
    The program began. The person in charge of the France-China Friendship Association was standing on the stage. She wanted the children to enjoy themselves to the fullest and enjoy a wonderful festival for establishing friendly relations between Chinese and French children. She said: "Although everyone is 15,000 kilometers away from the new China that is striving for progress, today we will try our best to turn the venue into a place full of the colors of the new China, so that everyone feels like they are in China in a dream. In addition to the many Chinese children present wearing their own national costumes, many French children are also dressed as Chinese. In this atmosphere full of scenes of Beijing, everyone should just pretend to be sleepwalking in beautiful China."
    The first program was a puppet show with a Bohemian flavor. Although this puppet show was not as magnificent and splendid as the one that came to Paris from China last year, it fully demonstrated the beautiful picture of the Gypsy's wandering life. Sometimes it was performed humorously and interestingly, making a group of children laugh heartily.
    Next was the costume competition program. One by one, the children dressed neatly and colorfully first lined up in a long queue offstage, and then walked onto the stage one by one. At the stage entrance, each person was given a number to hold in their hand and walked across the stage in sequence. In front of the stage, the person in charge sang out each person's number and the name of the character they were dressed as in front of the loudspeaker.
    Offstage, six judges held booklets in their hands, writing down each person's number and score. After more than two hundred costumed children had passed by, everyone gathered together to evaluate the scores.
    After the competition results were determined, the person in charge sang out the names of the winners on the stage. The winning children walked onto the stage one by one in single file, receiving prizes amidst the cheers and applause of the crowd.
    The children especially appreciated the prizes they received, because they were all foreign-language children's books and colorful paintings from the far-off new China.
    The winning children were naturally overjoyed. But the children who did not win prizes were just as happy. In addition to receiving a bag of sweets each, they also walked onto the stage to be admired by everyone.
    The costume competition program ended, followed by the lotus dance and national flag dance performed by a literacy class of overseas Chinese children. Dozens of children who had never seen their motherland performed dances with particularly strong Chinese national characteristics, winning warm and lasting applause from everyone. Many people felt as if they were in Beijing. The last program was a screening of the world-famous Czechoslovakian color puppet film. The title was "Golden-Haired Princess." This was an educational fairy tale film.
    The film program ended, and each child left the venue very satisfied. At the door, they shook hands and said goodbye, hoping to see each other again at this time next year.
    On the street, they were still wearing their costumes, walking through the crowd. Dozens of French children wearing Chinese national costumes especially attracted the attention of pedestrians. The children felt infinitely proud when they saw so many people watching, because they had also played the role of Chinese for half a day.

    中法儿童大联欢
    柳门
    春天给法国的孩子们带来许多欢快的节日。如果说四旬斋在古远的时代是教徒们斋戒禁食的季节，目前的四旬斋却给孩子们带来三个不同的节日。四旬斋的开头是吃烤饼和戴面具的“油腻的星期二”，中间是化装游行的“二旬节”，结尾是延续两个星期的“复活节”。
    照惯例，“二旬节”一定落在星期四，而星期四是法国儿童休假的日子。照惯例，法国儿童在这个节日大都穿上世界上各民族的古今装束，在街上游行取乐。今年，法中友好协会为着促进中法儿童友好关系，特别举行中法儿童大联欢的化装比赛会。
    时间本来定在下午二时三刻，但自二时起巴黎共和广场的一家大戏院里已经挤满了不同年龄的中法两国儿童。他们一个个都怀着兴奋的心情，来参加这个国际比赛会。他们的脸上闪耀着快乐的光芒。
    在喧嚷动乱中，母亲们都躲在大礼堂的角落里给孩子们涂脂抹粉、穿上新装。有的化装古代骑士，身穿铠甲、手擎长矛；有的哥哥打扮公爵，妹妹便打扮公爵夫人；有的打扮抗富济贫的罗宾汉，有的化装能征善战的拿破仑；有的装扮哥萨克骑兵，有的打扮夏威夷舞女；更有的穿上法国各地的民族服装，表演土风舞的步伐。
    但绝大多数的孩子们还是穿着中国服装。有的装扮清朝大官，有的打扮村夫农妇；有的穿上秧歌舞的服装，胸前还挂着一只小鼓；有的穿着长袍马褂，头顶瓜皮小帽；更有的打扮新嫁娘，手里拿着花扇遮羞。也许由于一部分人对于东方诸国服装分辨不清吧，有的穿着日本和服和越南长袍，也说是化装中国人。
    穿着各色各样花花绿绿服装的两百多个天真烂漫的孩子，兴高采烈地在人丛中奔跑，互相比较炫耀穿着的服饰。许多中国孩子都和法国孩子混在一块儿谈笑。
    节目开始了。台上站着法中友好协会的负责人。她要小朋友们尽情地欢乐，享受一个中法儿童建立友好关系的美好节日。她说：“大家虽然离开在奋斗中求进步的新中国有一万五千公里，但今天我们却尽量把会场变成富于新中国色彩的处所，使大家好像梦幻中到了中国一样。除了出席的许多中国小朋友穿着他们自己的民族服装外，法国小朋友也有很多化装中国人的。在这充满着北京景象的气氛中，大家就权当梦游美丽的中国吧。”
    第一个节目是具有波希米亚色彩的木偶戏。这木偶戏虽然没有去年从中国来巴黎演出那样堂皇富丽，但却也充分表现吉卜赛人的流浪生活的美丽的图画。有时表演得滑稽有趣，逗得一群孩子哈哈大笑。
    接着是服装比赛的节目。一个个穿着整齐、五光十色的孩子先在台下排成一长列的队伍，一个个地走上台去。在台口，每人都被分发一个号数，拿在手里，循序走过台前。在台前，由负责人在扩音器前高唱每个人的号数和所化装人物的名称。
    在台下，六个评判员手里拿着小册子，把每个人的号数和分数都记下来。等到二百多个化装的孩子都走过了，大家才聚在一起评定分数。
    比赛成绩评定后，负责人在台上高唱优胜者的名字。得奖的孩子又是一个个地鱼贯走上台去，在众人欢呼鼓掌中领取奖品。
    孩子们对于得到的奖品特别欣赏，因为，它们全是来自老远的新中国的外文儿童读物和五彩书画。
    得奖的孩子们自然兴高采烈。但得不到奖的孩子们也一样地欢乐，他们每人除了分得一包糖果外，也照样走上台去给大家欣赏。
    化妆比赛的节目结束了，接着是一群华侨子弟识字班表演的荷花舞和国旗舞。几十个从来没有见过祖国的孩子表演着中国民族色彩特别浓厚的舞蹈，博得大家热烈而持久的掌声。许多人都认为：大家好像置身北京。最后的一个节目是放映世界闻名的捷克斯洛伐克彩色木偶电影。片名是“金发公主”。这是一个富有教育意义的童话故事片。
    电影节目结束了，每个孩子都很满意地走出会场。在门口，他们互相握手话别。希望明年此时再见。
    在街上，他们仍然穿着化妆的服饰，从人群中走过。几十个穿着中国民族服装的法国孩子，特别引起行人的注意。孩子们看到有许多人围着看，心里也感到无限的骄傲，因为他们也曾扮演了半天的中国人。
