Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: How far has the second artificial satellite traveled? Today, the Soviet "Izvestia" published some interesting comparative figures on this question.

"Izvestia" said that the Soviet Union's second artificial Earth satellite has circled the Earth two thousand times, traveling a distance of ninety million kilometers. No machine made by mankind has ever traveled such a long distance. If a "Tu-104" passenger plane flew continuously at a speed of 900 kilometers per hour, it would take eleven and a half years to complete this distance. If a car traveling at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour drove non-stop, it would take about one hundred and three years, consuming fifteen million liters of gasoline. The moon would need one hundred and sixty-seven years to circle the Earth two thousand times. It would take the moon nearly three years to travel ninety million kilometers.

Since its launch, this satellite has flown over Moscow seven hundred times, about eighty of which were under good weather conditions. In the nine days from February 27th to March 7th, the satellite flew outside the Earth's shadow. During these one hundred and thirty orbits, the satellite was constantly exposed to sunlight.

"Izvestia" also published the opinions of many people, including the famous Soviet astronomer Kukarkin, on the satellite's two thousand orbits.

Professor Kukarkin suggested installing astronomical recording instruments on future artificial satellites and other space objects. He said that this would reveal the secrets of a previously unseen and entirely new world. Currently, scientists can only have certain theoretical concepts about this world due to the obstacles to astronomical research caused by the Earth's atmosphere.

Introducing the experience of optical observation of artificial satellites over the past six months, Kukarkin said that thousands of observations have been carried out since October 4th of last year. Based on these observation results, it is possible to reliably predict the satellite's operation and observe the rapid and enormous changes that occur during its operation.

The "Izvestia" published a conversation with the chairman of the selection committee for outstanding designs for a monument to the first artificial satellite. It is reported that this monument will be built on Lenin Hills in Moscow. Several thousand architects and sculptors have participated in the design competition.

### 苏联大卫星走九千万公里  月亮要将近三年才走这么远

    苏联大卫星走九千万公里
    月亮要将近三年才走这么远
    据新华社莫斯科22日电第二个人造卫星走的路程有多长？今天苏联“消息报”就此发表了一些有趣的对比数字。
      “消息报”说，苏联第二个人造地球卫星已经围绕地球飞行了两千圈，走了九千万公里的路程。人类过去制造的机器还没有一种走过这样远的路程。如果“图—104”式客机以每小时九百公里的速度不断飞行，要飞十一年半才能飞完这段距离。如果每小时速度一百公里的汽车不间断地走，要走一百零三年左右，需要消耗一千五百万公升汽油。月亮绕地球两千转，要一百六十七年。月亮走九千万公里，需要将近三年的时间。
    这个卫星从发射以来，已经有七百次飞过莫斯科上空，其中约有八十次是在气象条件良好的情况下飞过的。从2月27日到3月7日的九天内，卫星飞到了地球的影子以外。在这九天运行的一百三十圈内，卫星不断受到太阳的照射。
    “消息报”还发表了苏联著名天文学家库卡尔金等许多人就这个卫星运行两千圈发表的意见。
    库卡尔金教授建议在以后发射人造卫星和其他宇宙体的时候，在上面安装天文记录仪器。他说，这样就能揭开一个前所未见的、全新的世界的秘密。目前对于这个世界，由于地球大气给天文研究造成的障碍，科学家只能有某些理论上的概念。
    在介绍半年来对人造卫星进行的光学观测经验时，库卡尔金说，从去年10月4日起进行了数千次观测。根据这些观测结果，可以可靠地预测出卫星的运行和观察它们在运行时发生的、迅速而巨大的变化。
    消息报刊载了第一个人造卫星纪念碑优秀设计图征选委员会主席的谈话。据悉，这个纪念碑将建在莫斯科列宁山上。已有好几千名建筑师和雕刻家参加了设计竞赛。
