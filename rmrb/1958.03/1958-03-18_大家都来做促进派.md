Everyone Should Be a Promoter

Yu Guangyuan

Philosophy and social sciences must also have a great leap forward. In order to complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and to promote the great leap forward in production and the technological revolution, the development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences is essential.

Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences have always served the development of productive forces. It uses the dialectical materialist worldview, and the laws of social development, to arm the working masses, raise their awareness, and guide them on how to struggle. The working masses are the creators of history and the most important factor in the development of social productive forces. Therefore, as long as we remember the role of the masses in history, and remember the truth that politics is always in command and always the soul, we must be a promoter in the development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences.

Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and his many valuable instructions on how to apply materialist dialectics to practical work are of extremely great significance for the development of philosophy and social sciences. Today, our society's relations of production are suitable for the development of productive forces, and the superstructure is also basically adapted to the economic base. However, various contradictions still exist in our society, requiring us to deal with them, and requiring Marxist-Leninist philosophy and social sciences to conduct research on many important issues. At the same time, we must develop the thought of materialist dialectics, so that the broad masses of cadres, especially those in leading positions, are good at applying it to their work, so that all aspects of work can achieve considerable development.

If philosophy and social sciences are to leap forward, we must rely on everyone's efforts. To leap forward, there must be a huge driving force. Where does the driving force lie? This means that research must be based on the needs of socialist construction.

Our contingent of philosophy and social science workers is very large. Many people think that only researchers in research institutes and teachers in universities count. This idea is not entirely correct. Teaching and research personnel have definite responsibilities in the field of philosophy and social sciences, but many leading cadres working in Party and government organs are at least no less capable than the "scholars" in research institutions and schools in terms of the depth and breadth of their understanding of real society. As long as they can "learn while doing," and raise their experience in their work to a theoretical level, they can contribute to philosophy and social sciences. In fact, many people have done this and achieved relatively good results. If they can all take on the responsibility of developing philosophy and social sciences, philosophy and social sciences will surely leap forward rapidly.

On the question of whether philosophy and social sciences can leap forward, there are still some discouraging arguments. Some people believe that it can only develop slowly and cannot leap forward. In fact, the development of our country's philosophy and social sciences today has very favorable conditions: the country's socialist construction urgently requires the development of philosophy and social sciences; our country has accumulated very rich experience in revolution and construction, and there are a large number of materials and problems available for our research; in our country, the Marxist contingent, including cadres in leadership positions in all fields, can be said to be large and strong; in the years since liberation, we have done a lot of work in the theoretical study of cadres, in propagating materialism and criticizing bourgeois idealism, especially in the past year's anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and intellectuals has been greatly improved; we have already formulated a twelve-year long-range plan for the development of philosophy and social sciences, and established many research institutions; finally, the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend put forward by our Party has greatly promoted the development of our country's philosophy and social sciences. Here we have not mentioned the favorable international conditions. Therefore, there is no basis for thinking that philosophy and social sciences cannot leap forward.

I think we should start from two aspects to promote the development of philosophy and social sciences: one is ideological enlightenment, and the other is strengthening organizational work.

Philosophy and social sciences are ideological work. In order to promote the leap forward of philosophy and social sciences, each discipline must carefully consider what problems are most urgently needed to be studied at present, from which aspects these problems should be studied, and in which areas discussions and criticisms should be launched. Each discipline should write several weighty articles every year, and raise several important issues for discussion, so as to liven up the atmosphere in our academic circles.

In terms of strengthening organizational leadership, we must come up with many ways to tap the potential of philosophy and social sciences. At present, the philosophy and social science majors in colleges and universities, and the various research institutes in the field of philosophy and social sciences, are in urgent need of help. Responsible comrades taking part-time classes or research work is a good way. It is advisable to promote philosophy and social science workers making personal plans, but when making personal plans, they should be based on the needs of the country. For certain things that one person cannot do, they should be organized to do them. A group of young philosophy and social science workers has grown up in recent years, and we should care about their progress. We can investigate the new forces who have published articles in newspapers and periodicals in recent years, hold some meetings, and give them some help. Correctly evaluating research results is very important for promoting academic work. We should organize forces to select and recommend the better articles published this year. Doing so can accumulate good works. This evaluation work itself is a kind of refining work, and on this basis, further refining work can be done in the future. The meeting of the State Council Science Planning Commission has already put forward many organizational measures to promote the work of philosophy and social sciences, and I think everyone can come up with many good ways. With methods, plus everyone acting as a promoter and opposing being a retarder, the great leap forward of philosophy and social sciences is fully guaranteed.

    大家都来做促进派

    哲学社会科学一定也要来个大跃进。为了完成政治战线思想战线上的社会主义革命，促进生产大跃进，技术大革新，非有马克思列宁主义的哲学和社会科学的发展不可。
    马克思列宁主义的哲学社会科学从来就是为发展生产力服务的。它用辩证唯物主义的世界观，用社会发展的规律，来武装劳动群众，提高他们的觉悟，指引他们如何进行斗争。劳动群众是历史的创造者，是社会生产力发展的最重要的因素。因此，只要记得群众在历史上的作用，记得政治永远是统帅、永远是灵魂这个真理，我们就一定要在发展马克思列宁主义哲学社会科学事业上做一个促进派。
    毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的理论和关于如何运用唯物辩证法到实际工作中去的许多宝贵指示，对于哲学社会科学的发展有极其重大的意义。今天，我们社会的生产关系是适合于生产力发展的，上层建筑也是基本上同基础相适应的。但是，在我们的社会里，还存在着各种矛盾，要求我们去处理，要求马克思列宁主义的哲学社会科学对许多重要问题进行研究。同时，要发展唯物辩证法的思想，使广大干部、首先是担任领导工作的干部善于把它运用到工作中去，好使各方面的工作获得长足的发展。
    哲学社会科学要跃进，要靠大家来努力。要跃进，就要有巨大的动力。动力何在？这就是一定要从社会主义建设的需要出发来作研究。
    我国哲学社会科学工作者的队伍是很广大的。不少人认为只有研究所里的研究员、大学的教师才算。这种想法不完全对。教学、研究人员在哲学社会科学工作方面有确定的职责，但是，在党和政府机关里工作的许多领导干部，就他们对现实社会理解的深度和广度来说，比起研究机关和学校里的“学者”至少并无逊色。只要他们能够“边干边学”，把工作中的经验提到理论高度，是可以在哲学社会科学方面作出贡献来的。事实上也有许多人这样做了，并且取得比较好的成绩。如果他们都能把发展哲学社会科学的责任担负起来，哲学社会科学一定会迅速地向前跃进。
    在哲学社会科学能否跃进的问题上，直到现在还存在一些泄气论调。有一些人认为只能慢慢地向前发展，不能跃进。其实今天发展我国哲学社会科学具备着非常有利的条件：国家社会主义建设迫切地要求哲学社会科学的发展；我们国家在革命和建设中积累的经验是非常丰富的，可供我们研究的材料和问题是非常之多的；在我们国家里，马克思主义队伍，把各方面担任领导工作的干部算在内，是可以说得上广大强壮的；解放几年来，我们在干部理论学习，在宣传唯物主义批判资产阶级唯心主义等方面做了不少工作，特别是将近一年来的反右派斗争和整风运动，广大干部和知识分子的社会主义觉悟已大大提高；我们已经制定了十二年哲学社会科学发展的远景规划，建立了许多研究机构；最后我们党提出的百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策，对于我国哲学社会科学事业起了极大的促进作用。在这里我们还没有举有利的国际条件。因此，认为哲学社会科学不能跃进是没有任何根据的。
    我想应该从两方面着手来推动哲学社会科学的发展：一是思想启发，一是加强组织工作。
    哲学社会科学是思想工作。为了促使哲学社会科学向前跃进，各个学科一定要好好考虑当前最迫切需要研究的究竟有哪些问题，这些问题应该从哪方面去研究，应该从哪些地方展开讨论和批评，各个学科每年都应该写出几篇有份量的文章，提出几个重要问题来讨论，使我国学术界的空气活跃起来。
    在加强组织领导方面，我们要想出许多办法，把哲学社会科学的潜力挖一挖。现在高等学校的哲学社会科学各专业，各个哲学社会科学方面的研究所，迫切需要帮助。负责同志去兼课、兼任研究工作是个好办法。哲学社会科学工作者搞个人规划，是应该推行的，但在订个人规划时，应该根据国家的需要。对某些一个人不能办的事情，应该组织起来干。这几年已经生长起一批年轻的哲学社会科学工作者，应该关怀他们的进步。对这几年在报纸刊物上发表过文章的新生力量，可以调查一下，开些会，给他们些帮助。正确评价研究成果，对学术工作的推动是非常重要的。应该组织力量把本年度发表的比较好的文章选出来推荐。这样做可以把好的作品积累起来。这种评选工作本身就是一种提炼的工作，在这个基础上将来还可以作进一步的提炼工作。这次国务院科学规划委员会会议已经提出了许多条推动哲学社会科学工作的组织措施，我想大家一定可以想出许多好办法。有了办法，再加上大家都来做促进派，反对做促退派，哲学社会科学的大跃进是完全有保证的。
