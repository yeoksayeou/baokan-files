    Large Number of Pinyin Alphabet Readers Published

    (Our Newspaper News) Recently, the Chinese Language Reform Publishing House published a large number of readers related to the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet. The book "Hanyu Pinyin Alphabet Teaching Broadcast Lectures" is the textbook for the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet teaching broadcast lectures held by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. In addition to being used by listeners to learn the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet, it can also be used as a textbook for general intellectuals to learn the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet. Books such as "Look at Pictures to Recognize Characters" (six volumes have been published), "Farmer's Three-Character Classic," "Children's Three-Character Classic," and "Hundred Family Surnames" are in common folk forms in our country, such as writing Chinese characters in regular script with Hanyu Pinyin alphabets next to them, some with illustrations. These books are very helpful for readers who are new to the Pinyin alphabet.
