Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th: TASS reports that on March 3rd, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote to the President of the United States, Eisenhower, once again, stating the Soviet government's views on the agenda of the high-level meeting. Bulganin said that the Soviet government had proposed some issues that it believed should be discussed at the meeting, but the Soviet government has always been prepared, with everyone's agreement, to also discuss constructive suggestions put forward by other participating countries at the high-level meeting, aimed at ending the "Cold War."

In his letter, Bulganin said that the Soviet government is willing to discuss at the high-level meeting the issue of prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes and the elimination of military bases in other countries' territories, as well as the issue of concluding a German peace treaty and developing contacts and exchanges between countries. In addition, the Soviet Union does not object to exchanging views on ways to strengthen the United Nations Organization. However, the Soviet government does not agree to discuss the situation of Eastern European countries and the unification of the two Germanys at the meeting.

Bulganin's letter was delivered to US Secretary of State Dulles by the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Menshikov, on March 6th. This letter is a reply to Eisenhower's letter to him on February 15th regarding the high-level meeting issue.

Bulganin said that the US President said in his letter of February 15th that the Soviet government insists that the participants of the meeting only discuss the Soviet proposals and refuse to study the issues proposed by the US government for discussion. Such a statement is completely incorrect. In fact, the reason why the Soviet Union suggested discussing the issues it had raised at the high-level meeting is because people of all countries have long expected and demanded the resolution of these international issues.

Bulganin said that leaders of all countries who truly care about the fate of the world have the obligation to do everything in their power to promote agreement on the following issues raised by the Soviet Union: the issue of prohibiting the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons tests, various measures agreed upon by all countries to prevent sudden attacks, the signing of a non-aggression pact between the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the participating countries of the Warsaw Pact, and the commencement of troop reductions of foreign forces stationed in Germany and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, as well as the free development of international trade on the basis of mutual benefit, all according to mutual agreements.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government has never said that only the issues proposed by the Soviet Union for discussion can be studied at the high-level meeting. However, this does not mean that the Soviet Union can agree to the US proposal to discuss the situation of Eastern European countries and the unification of the two Germanys. Discussing these issues will only worsen relations between countries and will not have other results. Discussing such issues is tantamount to intolerable interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries, which the Soviet Union can absolutely not agree to. Including such issues on the agenda of the high-level meeting is tantamount to deliberately trying to make the meeting fail.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government agrees to also discuss at the high-level meeting the issue of prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes and the elimination of military bases in other countries' territories. Reaching an agreement on this important issue would greatly reduce the danger of a sudden outbreak of war and would be a major step forward in ensuring the conditions for the people of all countries to live and work in peace and contentment.

The Soviet government believes that the issue of concluding a German peace treaty can also be discussed. The Soviet Union suggests including the governments of both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the discussion of this issue. However, the issue of the unification of these two countries cannot be included as an item for discussion at future high-level meetings.

The Soviet government agrees that the high-level meeting can also discuss the development of contacts and exchanges between countries. The Soviet government attaches great importance to frequent direct contacts between leaders of various countries, which is conducive to exchanging views on pressing international issues and improving relations between countries.

Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government also does not object to exchanging views on ways to strengthen the United Nations Organization. However, it will not accept the proposals put forward by the United States aimed at undermining the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council.

Bulganin went on to say that the Soviet government has not only expressed its views on the scope of issues that the high-level meeting should discuss, but also on the participants of the meeting, the date of the meeting, and some other issues. Regrettably, the US government's views on these issues are still unknown.

He said that the Soviet government believes that all avenues should be used to speed up the preparations for the high-level meeting. In this regard, some issues can be agreed upon through diplomatic channels. The Soviet Union suggests convening a meeting of foreign ministers in April, and the foreign ministers' meeting should be responsible for formulating the agenda of the highest-level meeting, determining its members, and determining the time and place for holding the meeting. It is best if all these issues can be resolved in the near future.

Bulganin expressed concern about the current state of preparations for the highest-level meeting. He said that the US government has not responded to a series of specific suggestions made by the Soviet government regarding preparations for the highest-level meeting, but instead continues to raise some issues that are clearly unacceptable, all of which are clearly intended to delay the highest-level meeting.

Bulganin emphasized that what is particularly disturbing in this regard is that, on the one hand, the US and some member state governments of the North Atlantic Group are slow to decide on the issue of convening a meeting, while on the other hand, they are accelerating practical actions and conducting preparatory activities that cannot but aggravate the international situation. In this regard, Bulganin cited a series of facts about the US and its allies engaging in preparatory activities.

Bulganin said, we believe that if we all agree that it is necessary to hold a highest-level meeting to study pressing international issues, then at the very least we should not take measures that will only hinder the convening of the meeting and make it more difficult for us to solve the current tasks.

Bulganin then spoke about some of the views expressed by the US President in his letter of February 15th regarding Soviet-US relations. Bulganin welcomed Eisenhower's suggestion that influential Soviet citizens visit the United States to understand the lives of the American people. He also agreed with the US President's statement that the recently signed Soviet-US cultural, technical, and educational agreement must be fully utilized to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. He said that the Soviet Union is willing to further develop this relationship. It is precisely from this desire that we suggest concluding a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.

At the same time, Bulganin mentioned in his letter the recent propaganda in the United States advocating a "preemptive" war against the Soviet Union. He said that this kind of propaganda is not conducive to improving Soviet-US relations.

Bulganin also refuted Eisenhower's unfounded assertion that the Soviet Union should be held responsible for the fact that nuclear energy is currently mainly used for military purposes and not for peaceful purposes. Bulganin said that, in fact, it was not the Soviet Union that first began to produce and use atomic weapons. Moreover, the Soviet Union initially demanded the prohibition of the production and use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles of such weapons.

Bulganin declared that the Soviet Union is willing to sign a treaty that completely prohibits all types of nuclear weapons under appropriate international supervision, ceases its production, eliminates such weapons from armaments, and destroys all existing stockpiles, and the Soviet Union could do so even if it were to be signed tomorrow.

Bulganin concluded by saying that the people of all countries are expecting leaders responsible for the fate of their countries to take concrete actions to stop the threat of atomic war and consolidate peace. We believe that a meeting of national leaders with the participation of heads of government can and should be an important step in this direction. Now, there are still fundamental differences of opinion among countries on the issue of holding a high-level meeting, so we must make special joint efforts to practically prepare for this meeting so that it can be convened in the near future.

### 苏联催促美国赶快准备首脑会议  布尔加宁劝艾森豪威尔不要故意拖延  并对美国一系列的备战活动表示不安

    苏联催促美国赶快准备首脑会议
    布尔加宁劝艾森豪威尔不要故意拖延
    并对美国一系列的备战活动表示不安
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁3月3日再一次写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，表明苏联政府在高级会议议程问题上的观点。布尔加宁说，苏联政府曾经提出过一些它认为应该在会议上讨论的问题，但是苏联政府一直准备经大家同意后在高级会议上也讨论会议其他参加国提出的目的在终止“冷战”的建设性建议。
    布尔加宁在信里说，苏联政府愿意在高级会议上也讨论关于禁止利用宇宙空间于军事目的以及取消各国在别国领土上的军事基地的问题，关于缔结对德和约以及发展各国之间的联系和接触的问题。此外，苏联也不反对就加强联合国组织的途径交换意见。但是，苏联政府不同意在会上讨论东欧国家状况和两个德国统一的问题。
    布尔加宁的信已经由苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫在3月6日交给美国国务卿杜勒斯。这封信是对艾森豪威尔2月15日就高级会议问题给他的信的答复。
    布尔加宁说，美国总统在他2月15日的信中说，苏联政府坚持要会议参加者只讨论苏联的建议而拒绝研究美国政府建议讨论的问题。这样说是完全不正确的。实际上，苏联之所以建议在高级会议上讨论它提出过的那些问题，是由于各国人民早就期待和要求解决这些国际问题。
    布尔加宁说，真正关心世界命运的各国领导人有义务用全力促使苏联提出过的下列问题达成协议，这些是：关于禁止使用原子弹和氢弹的问题，停止核武器试验的问题，各国为了防止突然袭击而采取一些大家都同意的措施，在北大西洋公约组织参加国和华沙条约的参加国签定互不侵犯协定，双方并且根据相互的协议着手裁减外国在德国的驻军以及在中欧建立无原子武器地区、在互利基础上自由发展国际贸易等问题。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府从来没有说过在高级会议上只能研究苏联建议讨论的问题。然而，这并不是说，苏联可以同意美国提出的讨论关于东欧国家的状况以及统一两个德国的问题。讨论这些问题只会使得国家与国家之间的关系恶化，不会有其他结果。讨论这类问题，就等于不可容忍地干涉自主国家的内政，这是苏联绝对不能同意的。把这类问题列入高级会议议程，就等于蓄意要使会议失败。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府同意在高级会议上也讨论关于禁止利用宇宙空间于军事目的以及取消各国在别国领土上的军事基地的问题。就这个重要问题达成协议，将会大大减少战争突然爆发的危险，并且是在保障各国人民安居乐业的条件方面迈进了一大步。
    苏联政府认为，还可以讨论缔结对德和约的问题。苏联建议吸收德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国双方的政府参加这个问题的讨论。但是，关于这两个国家的统一的问题，不能作为将来的高级会议讨论的项目。
    苏联政府同意，高级会议还可以讨论发展各国之间的联系和接触的问题。苏联政府十分重视各国领导人之间经常的直接接触，这有利于就迫切的国际问题交换意见，改善国与国之间的关系。
    布尔加宁指出，苏联政府也不反对就加强联合国组织的途径交换意见。但是，它将不接受美国提出的旨在破坏安全理事会大国一致原则的建议。
    布尔加宁接着说，苏联政府不仅对高级会议应当讨论的问题的范围表示了自己的看法，而且对会议的参加者、召开日期和其他一些问题也表示了自己的看法。遗憾的是，直到现在还不知道美国政府对这些问题的看法。
    他说，苏联政府认为，应当利用一切途径，加快高级会议的准备工作。在这方面，某些问题是可以通过外交途径达成协议的。苏联建议在4月召开外交部长会议，外长会议应该负责制定最高级会议的议程，确定它的参加成员，举行会议的时间和地点。最好所有这些问题都能够在最近期间得到解决。
    布尔加宁对最高级会议的准备工作现在所处的情况表示不安。他说，美国政府没有答复苏联政府关于准备最高级会议的一系列具体建议，而是继续提出一些显然不能让人接受的问题，这一切分明是要拖延最高级会议。
    布尔加宁强调指出，在这方面尤其使人感到不安的是，美国和北大西洋集团的某些成员国政府一方面迟迟不决定召开会议的问题，另一方面却在加速采取实际行动，进行不能不加剧国际局势的备战活动。在这一方面，布尔加宁举出了一系列关于美国和它的盟国进行备战活动的事实。
    布尔加宁说，我们认为，如果我们大家都同意有必要举行最高级会议来研究迫切的国际问题，那么大家最低限度不应该采取只会阻碍会议的召开并且使得我们更难解决当前任务的措施。
    布尔加宁接着谈到了美国总统在2月15日信中就苏美关系问题表示的某些意见。布尔加宁表示欢迎艾森豪威尔关于要苏联有影响的公民访问美国了解美国人民的生活的建议。他还同意美国总统的这一表示，即必须充分利用最近签定的苏美文化、技术和教育协定，来改善苏美两国之间的关系。他说，苏联愿意进一步发展这种关系，正是从这种愿望出发，我们建议在苏联和美国之间缔结一项友好合作条约。
    布尔加宁同时在信里提到了最近美国有人在鼓吹对苏联发动“先发制人”的战争的宣传。他说，这类宣传对改进苏美关系是没有好处的。
    布尔加宁还驳斥了艾森豪威尔提出的下面这种毫无根据的说法，这就是，目前核能之所以主要用在军事方面而不用在和平方面，应该由苏联负责。布尔加宁说，实际上，首先开始生产和使用原子武器的并不是苏联。而且，苏联一开始就要求禁止生产和使用核武器，并且销毁现有的这种武器的储存。
    布尔加宁声明，苏联愿意签订一项在适当的国际监督下完全禁止一切类型的核武器、停止它的生产、把这种武器从军备中废除并销毁一切现有储备的条约，那怕是在明天签字，苏联也能办得到。
    布尔加宁最后说，各国人民在期待着负责国家命运的领导人采取具体行动，来制止原子战争的威胁，巩固和平。我们认为，有政府首脑参加的国家领导人会议可能而且应当是这方面的一个重要步骤。现在，各国在举行高级会议的问题上还存在着原则性的意见分歧，因此，我们必须特别共同努力来实际准备这个会议，使这个会议能够在最近召开。
