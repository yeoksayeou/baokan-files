Xinhua News Agency, March 9th. The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture held a comprehensive leap forward conference for film work in Beijing today. At the meeting, representatives from film production, the machinery industry, film processing, publishing, and distribution departments, as well as directors and actors, reported on their leap forward targets and conducted mutual evaluations. In the end, they unanimously resolved to launch a friendship competition with cultural departments such as art, publishing, social culture, cultural relics, and higher art colleges.

He Wenjin, Deputy Director of the Beijing Film Studio, said that the studio plans to produce nine feature films this year, an increase of 125% compared to last year. The average cost of each color film will be reduced to 250,000 yuan, which is 20,000 yuan less than the target proposed by the Shanghai Film Studio.

Hu Jiemin, Deputy Director of the August First Film Studio, proposed that the studio will produce ten feature films this year, doubling the number from last year. Their slogan is: Work hard for two years, double production, reduce costs by 30%, and exceed the product quality of 1957.

The meeting also announced the challenge letters recently given to brother factories across the country by the Shanghai Film Studio and the Changchun Film Studio. The Shanghai Film Studio has increased its production target for feature films this year from the previously set 35 to 39. The Changchun Film Studio has also increased its production target for feature films to 30 this year. The film workers in Beijing warmly expressed their willingness to accept the challenge.

Representatives from film machinery factories in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Harbin who are attending the Film Machinery Industry Leap Forward Conference, and representatives attending the Film Distribution and Screening Work Conference, all expressed at the meeting that they would strengthen collaboration with fraternal departments to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in the film industry.

    加强协作　互相评比
    促进电影事业全面跃进
    据新华社9日讯　文化部电影事业管理局今天在北京举行电影工作全面跃进大会，会上电影制片、机械工业、洗印、出版、发行等部门的代表和导演、演员们分别报告了跃进指标，互相进行了评比，最后并一致决议同艺术、出版、社会文化、文物、高等艺术院校等文化部门展开友谊竞赛。
    北京电影制片厂副厂长何文今说，这个厂今年计划生产艺术片九部，比去年增加125％。每部彩色片的平均成本降低到二十五万元，比上海电影制片公司提出的指标还可少用二万元。
    八一电影制片厂副厂长胡介民提出，这个厂今年将生产十部艺术片，比去年增加一倍。他们的口号是：苦干两年，生产突破两番，成本降低30％，产品质量超过1957年。
    会上还宣读了上海电影制片公司和长春电影制片厂最近给全国兄弟厂的挑战书。上影各厂今年艺术片的生产数字已由不久前制定的三十五部增加到三十九部。长春电影制片厂今年艺术片的生产指标也增加到三十部。北京的电影工作者们热烈的表示应战。
    正在北京参加电影机械工业跃进会议的南京、上海、哈尔滨电影机械厂的代表和出席电影发行、放映工作会议的代表都在会上表示，要同兄弟部门加强协作，实现电影事业全面大跃进。
