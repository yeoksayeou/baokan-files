Give Birth to One, Keep One Alive; Keep One Alive, Make One Strong
Inner Mongolia's Thousand-Li Grassland is Busy Receiving Lambs

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Inner Mongolia Daily reports: Herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are making every effort to do a good job in receiving and protecting lambs. The western pastoral areas are approaching the peak lambing season, and the eastern pastoral areas have also begun lambing. The battle cry of the herdsmen is: Give birth to one, keep one alive; keep one alive, make one strong.
    The lambing and lamb protection work in the pastoral areas of the Jirem League and the western leagues is about to enter its peak season. In the pastoral areas of the Chahar League, the Ih Ju League, the Ulanqab League, the Bayannur League, and the Pingdiquan Administrative Region, 30% to 40% of the ewes have already given birth to lambs. According to a sample survey of ten pastoral cooperatives in the Chayouhou Banner of the Pingdiquan Administrative Region, all ewes that have given birth have had access to pens. Among them, the 77 newly built pens in four pastoral cooperatives can accommodate more than 9,200 lambs, so none of the 450 lambs already born have died. The 17 pastoral cooperatives in the Jirem League have adopted the method of assigning dedicated personnel to receive lambs and distributing the responsibility to individual households. The survival rate of the first batch of 2,450 lambs reached 95% to 97%.
    In the colder areas of the east, although large-scale lambing work has not yet begun, preparations have been largely completed. In the Ju Ud League, lambing preparations were made ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. In Ar Horqin Banner alone, more than 5,700 people organized 365 lambing groups, striving to reduce ewe abortions and lamb deaths by 40% to 58% compared with last year. The survival rate of the 1,780 lambs already born has reached 98.5%. In order to achieve the target of 95% to 98% survival rate for young animals, each banner has stipulated that every 300 to 400 ewes constitute a lambing unit, and requires entering the spring camp for lambing ten days earlier than in previous years.

    生一只，活一只；活一只，壮一只
    内蒙古千里草原接羔忙
    本报讯　内蒙古日报消息：内蒙古自治区的牧民正在全力做好接羔保育工作。西部牧区已临接羔旺季；东部牧区也开始接羔。牧民们的战斗口号是：生一只，活一只；活一只，壮一只。
    哲里木盟牧区和西部各盟牧区的接羔保育工作即将进入旺季。察哈尔盟、伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟、巴彦淖尔盟和平地泉行政区的牧区，已有30％—40％的母羊生了羔。据平地泉行政区察右后旗十个牧业社的抽查，产羔母羊已经全部有了棚圈；其中四个牧业社新搭的七十七所棚圈，即可容纳九千二百多只羊羔，因而现在已出生的四百五十只羊羔就没死一只。哲里木盟十七个牧业社采取专人接羔和分户接羔的办法，第一批接下来的二千四百五十只羔羊，成活率也达到了95％到97％。
    东部比较寒冷地区，大量接羔工作虽未开始，准备工作却已大体就绪了。在昭乌达盟，接羔准备比往年提前了十天到半个月，仅阿鲁科尔沁旗就有五千七百多人组织了三百六十五个接羔组，争取今年母羊流产和羔羊死亡比去年降低40％至58％；现在已生下来的一千七百八十只羊羔，成活率已经达到了98.5％。为完成95％—98％的仔畜成活率指标，各旗已规定每三百只到四百只母羊为一个接羔单位，并要求比往年提前十天进入接羔的春营地。
