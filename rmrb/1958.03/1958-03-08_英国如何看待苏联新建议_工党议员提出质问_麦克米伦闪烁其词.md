Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: Labour's chief spokesman on foreign affairs, Bevan, questioned the Conservative government in the House of Commons on the 6th about Britain's attitude toward the Soviet Union's new proposals for an East-West summit and a meeting of foreign ministers. He said that the Soviets were in favor of holding a foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the membership, date, and agenda of a summit, but the Americans believed that the meeting should reach substantial agreement on some issues, which the Soviets thought should be left for the summit to discuss. He asked Prime Minister Macmillan to comment on this point.

Macmillan indicated that he was unwilling to comment on the matter. He believed that the "general attitude" of the Americans and all its allies was not to obtain a guarantee of agreement before the summit was held, "but the agenda and environment of the (summit) should be such as to give a reasonable hope of success."

Labour leader Gaitskell said that there was considerable "confusion" in the current exchange of views with the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels on the issue of convening a summit. It was said that the West advocated holding a foreign ministers' meeting before the summit, while the Soviets opposed it. But now it seems that the Soviets are ready to hold a foreign ministers' meeting, while the West is opposed to it. He believed that although it was difficult to see at the outset on what issues East and West could agree, some talks should be held to "get things started."

Macmillan replied: He was unwilling to say anything on this issue at present. However, he added: "Our attitude, generally speaking, is this: that whatever the method, whether it is a meeting of foreign ministers, or discussions through diplomatic channels, or a combination of both, what we are anxious to do is to arrange for meetings that at least have the possibility of leading to some measure of success."

Some Labour MPs believed that an attempt should be made to invite Chinese representatives to attend the summit.

Macmillan disagreed with this view. He said that the members participating in this meeting "must depend on the results of the preparatory meeting and must take into account the issues that the summit may agree to discuss."

    英国如何看待苏联新建议
    工党议员提出质问　麦克米伦闪烁其词
    新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：工党外交事务主要发言人比万6日在下院就英国对苏联关于东西方最高级会议和外交部长会议的新建议抱什么态度的问题，向保守党政府提出质询。他说，苏联人赞成举行外长会议来讨论最高级会议的成员、日期和议程，但是美国人认为会议还应当就一些问题达成实质性协议，而这些问题却是苏联人认为应当留待最高级会议讨论的。他要求首相麦克米伦就这点表示意见。
    麦克米伦表示，他不愿意就这个问题发表意见。他认为，美国人和它的所有盟国的“总的态度”，并不是要得到在最高级会议召开之前就达成协议的保证，“但是（最高级）会议的议程和环境应当能使会议有获得成功的相当希望”。
    工党领袖盖次克尔说，目前在通过外交途径就召开最高级会议的问题同苏联交换意见方面，说法相当“混乱”。据说，西方主张在最高级会议之前先举行一次外长会议，而苏联人则反对这样做。但是现在看来，又轮到苏联人准备举行一次外长会议而西方表示反对了。他认为，尽管开头很难看出在什么问题上东西方会达成协议，还是应该举行一些会谈来“开个头”。
    麦克米伦回答说：他不愿意在现在就这个问题说些什么话。不过他又说：“我们的态度一般来说是这样：不管是什么办法，是外长会议，还是通过外交途径的讨论，还是二者并行，我们切望做的是：为至少可能导致局部成功的会议进行安排。”
    工党议员中有人认为，应当设法邀请中国代表出席最高级会议。
    麦克米伦不同意这个意见。他说，参加这个会议的成员“必须取决于预备会议的结果，并且必须考虑到最高级会议可能同意讨论的问题”。
