To promote a great leap forward in artistic work, the Chinese Artists Association issued a five-point proposal to local branches of the Artists Association and national artists on the 22nd: 1. All association members should create a 1958 leap forward plan for their creations and guarantee its implementation; 2. Pay attention to improving the ideological and artistic quality of works, and oppose shoddy work; 3. Vigorously support the popularization of art, create more New Year pictures, comic strips, posters, illustrations, and create more art works for children; 4. Strengthen guidance for mass art activities. Through giving reports, teaching classes, and individually mentoring apprentices, invigorate mass art life and cultivate a large number of amateur art workers; 5. All members should go to the countryside and factories at least once this year, either for a "cursory glance" or a more "thorough investigation."

    面向群众　保量保质
    美协向全国美术家提出倡议
    本报讯　为了促进美术工作大跃进，中国美术家协会于22日向各地美协分会及全国美术家提出五项倡议：一、凡协会会员都订出1958年创作跃进规划，并保证其实现；二、注意提高作品的思想性和艺术性，反对粗制滥造；三、大力支持美术普及工作，多多创作年画、连环画、招贴画、插图并多多为少年儿童创作美术作品；四、加强辅导群众美术活动。通过作报告、上课和个别带徒弟等方式，活跃群众美术生活，培养大量业余美术工作者；五、今年所有会员至少下乡下厂一次，“走马看花”或“下马看花”。
