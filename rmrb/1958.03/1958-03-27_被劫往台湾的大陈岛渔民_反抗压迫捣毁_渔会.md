Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Taipei Dispatch: A group of fishermen from Dachén Island, Zhejiang Province, who were kidnapped to Taiwan by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, smashed the "Fishermen's Association" in Hualien City, eastern Taiwan, on March 14, protesting the Chiang Kai-shek clique's obstruction of their fishing at sea.

Taiwan newspapers reported that a group of Dachén Island fishermen residing in Hualien City had a dispute at the seaside on the 14th because Chiang's army's coastal defense forces forbade them from going out to sea to fish and insisted that they submit new sea signal flags before allowing them to pass. Later, more than 40 former Dachén Island fishermen went to the Kuomintang-controlled "Hualien Fishermen's Association" to obtain new sea signal flags. Because the "Fishermen's Association officials" deliberately made things difficult and refused to give them, public anger was aroused, and they smashed the office furniture, glass doors, and windows of the "Fishermen's Association" office, injuring four "Fishermen's Association officials." The chief of the Hualien City Police Bureau and the head of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Chiang Kai-shek clique hurriedly led a large number of police officers to violently suppress the fishermen, which was met with resistance from the fishermen, who injured the brutal head of the Criminal Investigation Team and several police officers. Afterwards, many fishermen were arrested.

More than 20,000 residents of the original Dachén, Yushan, and other islands were kidnapped to Taiwan by Chiang's army under the direction of the United States in February 1955. Their lives in Taiwan have been very miserable for the past three years, and many have already died in displacement, poverty, and disease.

    被劫往台湾的大陈岛渔民
    反抗压迫捣毁“渔会”
    新华社26日讯　台北消息：被美国和蒋介石集团劫运到台湾去的浙江省大陈岛渔民一批，3月14日在台湾东部花莲市捣毁压迫渔民的“渔会”，抗议蒋介石集团阻挠他们出海捕鱼。
    台湾报纸说，寄居在花莲市的大陈岛渔民一批，14日因蒋军海防部队禁止他们出海捕鱼，坚要他们交验新的出海信号旗才肯放行，双方曾在海滨发生纠纷。后来，原大陈岛渔民四十多人前往国民党御用的“花莲渔会”索领新出海信号旗，因“渔会官员”故意刁难不给，才激起公愤，当场把“渔会”办公室的办公桌椅玻璃门窗等捣毁，打伤了“渔会官员”四人。蒋介石集团花莲市警察分局长和刑事组长慌忙率领大批警察前往，以暴力镇压，遭到渔民的反抗，渔民们把凶暴的警察局刑事组长和警察多人打伤。事后，渔民多人被捕。
    原大陈、渔山等岛的居民两万多人是在1955年2月被蒋军在美国指使下劫往台湾的。他们三年来在台湾的生活十分悲惨，许多人已经在流离失所、贫病交迫中死去。
