    U.S. Economic Expansion in Africa
    Liu Tongkun
    In the past year or so, U.S. government officials, capitalists, and all sorts of delegations have flocked to Africa one after another. The visits of these "guests" from across the Atlantic are not for sightseeing, but to realize their imperialist aggression and expansion.
    U.S. aggression against Africa, this vast and rich continent, did not begin today. As early as the beginning of the 19th century, it began the slave trade on the east coast of Africa. Starting in 1822, the American "Colonization Society" moved some of the freed black slaves in the country to the west coast of Africa, establishing its first stronghold for aggression against Africa. In 1836, the United States obtained privileges in Morocco through the so-called "Treaty of Friendship" signed with Morocco. Since then, the United States has continued to carry out aggression and expansion in Africa. However, before World War II, the economic power of the United States in the African continent was relatively small. As of 1935, U.S. investment in the entire African continent was only $123 million.
    As soon as World War II ended, the United States, through "aid," loans, and investments, massively invaded Africa.
    In North Africa and Northeast Africa, the United States mainly provides government "aid" and International Cooperation Administration loans. Up to 1957, according to incomplete statistics, the United States provided Morocco with 35 million U.S. dollars, Tunisia with 12 million U.S. dollars, Libya with 54 million U.S. dollars, and Ethiopia with no less than 100 million U.S. dollars through the "Marshall Plan," "Point Four Program," and "aid" loans. But the recipient countries not only did not get any benefits, but were controlled by the United States. For example, the U.S.-Libya "Technical Cooperation" agreement expressly stipulates that the "Joint Committee" must put forward "research and suggestions" to the Libyan government on all issues related to the "development" of Libya (including political issues). As the Libyan newspaper "Tripoli" said, "This kind of aid is only beneficial to the United States, and can only guarantee the United States' control over the recipient countries."
    In the area south of the Sahara Desert, U.S. aggression is mainly carried out through private investment and loans from state monopoly capital. U.S. investment in the Union of South Africa is the country with the most U.S. investment in Africa. As of April 1957, U.S. investment had exceeded 300 million U.S. dollars. Liberia ranks second in U.S. investment in Africa, reaching 260 million U.S. dollars by 1955. At present, U.S. investment in the Central African Federation has exceeded 130 million U.S. dollars, and investment in the Belgian Congo has become the first among imperialist monopoly capital. U.S. investment in Ghana and other British and French colonies is also increasing. The penetration of U.S. capital into the above-mentioned areas mostly takes the form of direct investment. Through investment, U.S. monopoly capital controls Liberia's high-quality iron ore, cocoa, timber, railways, hydroelectric power, fisheries, rubber, oil industry, and oil tanker transportation industries. In colonies controlled by European colonial countries, the United States takes measures such as buying corporate stocks, providing loans to existing enterprises, jointly establishing enterprises with old colonial country monopoly capital, or creating subsidiary companies to intervene. For example, three major U.S. companies penetrated the Upper Katanga Company by purchasing 2.2 million shares of the British "Tanganyika Company," and controlled the production of uranium, copper, tin, tungsten, and cobalt in the Belgian Congo with loans to Belgian companies. U.S. capital participated in the exploitation of copper mines and other mineral resources in Northern Rhodesia in the form of loans, and controlled the production of gold and diamonds in Equatorial Africa. The Rockefeller Consortium in South Africa controls more than 100 enterprises through joint investment companies with British capital, and the production of uranium mines is jointly funded by the United States with two-thirds of the capital together with Britain and South Africa. Three U.S. monopoly organizations and the French Rothschild Consortium also control 40% of lead mining and 80% of zinc mining in Morocco in this way, and monopolize the exploitation of copper, lead, and zinc by the "Central African Development Company" in Equatorial Africa.
    As of 1955, U.S. direct investment in the entire African continent exceeded 774.7 million U.S. dollars, and loans reached 602.4 million U.S. dollars.
    Uranium, the raw material for atomic bombs, is one of the main objects of U.S. plunder. The Belgian Congo is the largest uranium producing region in the capitalist world. During World War II, uranium ore accounting for three-quarters of the total output was shipped to the United States. After the United States controlled the Upper Katanga United Mining Company after the war, it transported more than 4,000 tons of uranium ore produced each year back to the United States. According to the agreement signed between South Africa and the United States and Britain, the 4,400 tons of uranium oxide produced annually in South Africa are also mainly exported to the United States. At present, the United States is investing 40 million U.S. dollars to exploit two new gold mines in South Africa to mine gold and extract uranium. The United States is also using various methods to penetrate the uranium mining in other regions such as the Sahara and Northern Rhodesia. Cobalt, which is used to make hydrogen bombs, is almost entirely monopolized by the United States. In addition to all the cobalt in Morocco being supplied to the United States, most of the cobalt in Northern Rhodesia and Congo also falls into the hands of the United States. Copper, a strategic material, is mainly produced in Northern Rhodesia and Congo. In 1955 alone, 60,000 tons were exported from Northern Rhodesia to the United States. A considerable part of other regions is also seized by the United States. At present, the United States is actively penetrating the copper mining in Mauritania. Liberia's iron ore and rubber are all supplied to the United States. The United States is also plundering manganese in South Africa and Gabon, as well as lead, zinc and other materials in other regions.
    The U.S.'s frantic expansion in Africa has met with fierce resistance from Britain and France. After the end of World War II, Britain used the two weapons of the Sterling Area and Imperial Preference System in Central and South Africa to suppress the dumping of U.S. goods. France implemented a license system in Morocco to combat the import of U.S. textiles. To this end, the United States protested to the then governor of Morocco and sued the International Court of Arbitration. In order to counter the U.S. capital offensive, Britain and France have each formulated ten-year plans to "develop" their colonies. From 1950 to 1954, France and Britain also held many meetings to study the "development" of French colonies to resist the intrusion of U.S. capital. The establishment of the Central African Federation by Britain and the East African Federation that was planned but later failed were also mainly aimed at resisting U.S. expansion.
    In 1956, Britain and France launched a failed war of aggression against Egypt, and their influence in the Middle East was therefore severely weakened. The national independence movement in the entire Middle East region has been unprecedentedly developed. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the United States put forward the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine," openly announcing that the United States would "fill" the "vacuum" left by Britain and France in the Middle East, and step up the suppression of the surging tide of national independence movements. The "Middle East" mentioned here by Eisenhower also includes Africa.
    Under the direction of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States has stepped up its aggression against North Africa. It first formulated a plan to seize the Sahara. The content is to force France to accept the investment of U.S. oil tycoons by providing loans to France and supporting France's Algerian policy, and to buy the stocks of the "Algerian Petroleum Company" and the Sahara Petroleum Company. In this way, U.S. forces can invade the most important area of North Africa—the Sahara oil field.
    In order to realize its plan, the United States sent Nixon, Richards and a large number of congressmen and politicians to Africa to carry out activities and provide economic "aid" to North African countries. On the other hand, it colluded with Britain to put pressure on France, forcing France to agree to their further penetration into North Africa. Under pressure from the situation, France had to make some concessions on the issue of the Sahara oil field, agreeing that the United States and Britain would jointly invest in development. However, the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and France did not ease as a result. The joint supply of arms to Tunisia by the United States and Britain on November 15, 1957, regardless of France's opposition, was a manifestation of the intensification of this contradiction.
    However, today's Africa is no longer a "dark continent" to be divided at will. The light of the national independence movement is illuminating the most remote areas of Africa. Neither the U.S. dollar nor U.S. military aircraft carrying atomic weapons can restrain the tide of African national independence. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of last year has issued a powerful voice: "People in all parts of the African jungle have stood up," "The African people demand the establishment of an Africa for Africans!"

    美国对非洲的经济扩张
    刘桐昆
    最近一年多来，美国政府官员、资本家和各种各样代表团一批接一批地涌到了非洲。大西洋彼岸“客人”的光临不是为了游山玩水，而是为了实现他们的帝国主义侵略和扩张。
    美国对于非洲这个广阔而富饶大陆的侵略远不是从今天才开始的。早在十九世纪初它就在非洲东海岸开始了贩卖奴隶的勾当。1822年开始，美国“殖民协会”把国内一部分被释放了的黑人奴隶迁移到非洲西海岸，建立起它侵略非洲的第一个据点。1836年，美国通过和摩洛哥签订的所谓“友好条约”取得了在摩洛哥的特权。此后美国在非洲不断进行侵略扩张。但是在第二次世界大战以前，美国在非洲大陆的经济势力是比较小的。截至1935年，美国在整个非洲的投资也不过一万二千三百万美元。
    第二次世界大战刚一结束，美国就通过“援助”、贷款和投资等方式，大肆侵入非洲。
    在北非和东北非，美国主要是提供政府“援助”和国际合作署贷款。到1957年为止，据不完全的统计，美国通过“马歇尔计划”、“第四点计划”、“援助”贷款等方式，向摩洛哥提供了三千五百万美元，突尼斯一千二百万美元，利比亚五千四百万美元，埃塞俄比亚不下一亿美元。但受援国不仅没有得到什么好处，相反地被美国控制起来。例如，美国和利比亚的“技术合作”协定就明文规定：“共同委员会”对利比亚政府就有关“开发”利比亚的一切问题（包括政治问题）得提出“研究和建议”。正如利比亚“的里波黎”报所说的，“这种援助只对美国有利，只能是保证美国对受援国家实行控制。”
    在撒哈拉大沙漠以南地区，美国的侵略主要是通过私人投资和国家垄断资本贷款进行的。美国在南非联邦的投资是它在非洲投资最多的一个国家。截至1957年4月为止，美国投资已超过三亿美元。利比里亚占美国在非洲投资的第二位，到1955年投资即已达二万六千万美元。目前美国在中非联邦投资已超过一万三千万美元，在比属刚果的投资在各帝国主义垄断资本中已跃居第一位。美国在加纳和英法其他殖民地的投资也在不断增加。美国资本渗入上述地区大部分是采取直接投资的形式。通过投资，美国垄断资本控制了利比里亚的优质铁矿、可可、木材、铁路、水电、渔业、橡胶、石油业和油船运输业等。在欧洲殖民国家控制下的殖民地，美国则采取收买企业股票、对原有企业贷款、同老牌殖民国家垄断资本合办企业或自创儿女公司等方式插足进去。如美国三个大公司就是通过购买英国“坦噶尼喀公司”二百二十万股票渗入上卡坦加公司，并以贷款渗入比利时公司而控制了比属刚果铀、铜、锡、钨、钴的生产。美国资本以贷款形式参加了北罗德西亚的铜矿和其他矿藏的开采，控制了赤道非洲黄金和钻石生产。洛克菲勒财团在南非通过和英国资本合组投资公司控制了一百多个企业，其中铀矿生产就是由美国出资三分之二同英国和南非合办的。美国三个垄断组织和法国洛希尔财团也是以这种方式控制了摩洛哥40％的采铅业和80％的采锌业，垄断了赤道非洲“中非开发公司”铜、铅、锌的开采。
    截至1955年为止，美国在整个非洲的直接投资超过了七万七千四百万美元，贷款达六万零二百四十万美元。
    作为原子弹原料的铀是美国攫夺的主要对象之一。比属刚果是资本主义世界最大的产铀地区，二次大战期间，占全部产量四分之三的铀矿石就已被运往美国。战后在美国控制了上卡坦加联合矿业公司后就把它每年生产的四千余吨铀矿石都运回美国。根据南非和美、英签订的协定，南非每年所生产的四千四百吨氧化铀也主要是输往美国。目前美国正在以四千万美元投资开采南非两处新的金矿来开采黄金并提炼铀。美国还在用各种方法渗入撒哈拉、北罗德西亚等其他地区的铀矿开采。制造氢弹的钴差不多完全为美国垄断。除摩洛哥的钴全部供应美国外，北罗德西亚和刚果的钴也大部分落于美国之手。作为战略物资的铜，主要产地是北罗德西亚和刚果。1955年单是北罗德西亚输出到美国去的就有六万吨。其他地区也有相当大的一部分为美国所攫取。目前美国正积极渗入毛里塔尼亚的铜矿开采。利比里亚的铁矿和橡胶都是全部供应美国的。美国对南非和加蓬的锰及其他地区的铅、锌等物资都在大肆掠夺。
    美国在非洲的疯狂扩张遭到了英、法猛烈的抵抗。二次大战结束以后，英国在中、南非以英镑集团和帝国特惠制两个武器压制美国商品的倾销。法国在摩洛哥实行许可证制度打击美国纺织品的输入。为此美国曾向摩洛哥当时总督提出抗议并告到国际仲裁法庭。英、法为对抗美国资本进攻都各自拟定了“开发”殖民地十年计划。1950—54年法国和英国还多次举行会议研究“开发”法属殖民地抵抗美国资本侵入问题。英国成立中非联邦和曾筹组后来失败的东非联邦，其主要目的也是想借此抗拒美国扩张。
    1956年，英、法发动侵埃战争失败，它们在中东的影响因而也遭到了严重的削弱。整个中东地区的民族独立运动有了空前发展。美国乘这个时机提出了臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”，公开宣布美国要“填补”英法在中东留下的“真空”，加紧镇压汹涌澎湃的民族独立运动浪潮。艾森豪威尔这里所说的“中东”，也包括非洲。
    在“艾森豪威尔主义”的方针下，美国加紧了对北非的侵略。它首先拟定了夺取撒哈拉的计划。其内容是以对法贷款和支持法国的阿尔及利亚政策为条件迫使法国接受美国石油大王投资，收买“阿尔及利亚石油公司”和撒哈拉石油公司的股票，这样，美国势力便可以侵入北非最重要的地区——撒哈拉油田了。
    美国为了实现它的计划，一方面派尼克松、理查兹及大批议员政客去非洲进行活动，向北非国家提供经济“援助”，一方面勾结英国对法国施加压力，强使法国同意它们进一步渗入北非。法国迫于形势，不得不在撒哈拉油田问题上作了一些让步，同意美英共同投资开采，但是，美英和法国之间的矛盾并未因此而缓和下来。1957年11月15日美、英不顾法国反对联合向突尼斯供应军火，正是这一矛盾尖锐化的表现。
    但是，今天的非洲已经不是任人分割的“黑暗大陆”了。民族独立运动的光芒，正在照亮了非洲最偏僻的地区。无论是美元或是带着原子武器的美国军用飞机，都抑制不了非洲的民族独立的浪潮。去年年底在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会已经发出强大的声音：“非洲丛林的各地人民都站起来了”，“非洲人民要求建立非洲人的非洲！”
