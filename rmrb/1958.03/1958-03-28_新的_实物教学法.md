    A New "Object Teaching Method"
    Zeng Xisan

    Exhibitions are a good form of publicity and education. During this anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, small-scale object exhibitions were held in many organizations. After seeing several of them, I felt that they were very educational and profound. The waste and backlog phenomena in my own organization were related to my own bureaucracy and subjectivism. I felt very distressed after seeing them. Other comrades also saw it and said it that way.

    Is our organization a "clean government department"? As long as everyone checks and inventories the large and small warehouses, every organization can find problems. And when the problems are displayed (by holding an exhibition), it becomes even clearer, and some are even shocking.

    Of course, these waste and backlog phenomena are mainly due to the bureaucracy and extravagance of the leadership. Many cases of improper purchases, using things extravagantly, waste and backlogs, many cases of being fond of grandeur and novelty, should be directly attributed to the bureaucracy and extravagance of the leaders. Some things that are not directly the responsibility of the leaders also show a lack of inspection by the leaders, which is also a harm caused by bureaucracy. Can the leaders of the organizations not feel "guilt", not conduct self-examination, and not be determined to correct their mistakes after seeing such an exhibition?

    At the same time, such exhibitions can also educate every comrade. The exhibitions I saw all displayed a lot of pen holders, meter sticks, glass plates, staplers, copper ink boxes, paper clips... and forms, envelopes, and stationery that would take years or decades to use up. They also displayed many pieces of "junk" furniture, some of which were brand new but died young, some new chairs with broken legs, some new alarm clocks that were dismantled; and also piles of locks and keys that had lost their "mates"... Aren't these phenomena related to all the comrades in the organization? An office with only three or four people has seven or eight pen holders, and some even more; pencils, brushes, and pen nibs, people are unwilling to use the inferior ones when they have good ones; work clothes and gloves, people take new ones without washing the old ones; many motor vehicle teams in organizations buy one set of repair tools after another; some communications teams in organizations buy good leather clothes and hats instead of using the old ones; some comrades lose their fountain pens and clothes and don't look for them... Today, when these "small things" are collected, they have become an important part of the exhibition. Don't you think this is strange? No matter which comrade sees such an exhibition, he cannot help but think of himself.

    Some comrades say that in the anti-five airs campaign, although the primary task is to burn the five airs of the leadership, every comrade must also examine his own thoughts in this movement. Today's double-anti movement is not a matter of investigating responsibility, but from the perspective of ideological examination, it cannot be said that it has nothing to do with ourselves. Some comrades say that some waste phenomena are due to the leadership's conciliatory thinking. Doesn't this mean that some comrades being led also have extravagant thoughts?

    Every comrade should carefully look at such a small exhibition. Here, they can receive an extremely vivid and extremely profound socialist education. Only when everyone studies the causes of waste and everyone takes a step forward ideologically can we eradicate the root cause and clarify the source.

    新的“实物教学法”
    曾习三
    展览会是宣传和教育的一种好形式。这次反浪费、反保守运动，在许多机关中举行了小型的实物展览会，我看了几个，觉得教育意义很大、很深刻；在本机关的浪费积压现象中有许多和我自己的官僚主义、主观主义有关系，我看了之后十分痛心。别的同志也都这样看和这样说。
    我们机关是“清水衙门”吗？只要大家一检查，只要到大小仓库一清点，每个机关都可以发现问题；再把问题一摆出来（开展览会），那就更清楚了，并且有不少还是怵目惊心的。
    当然，这些浪费和积压现象，主要的是由于领导上的官气和阔气作怪。很多购置不当、宽打窄用和浪费积压的现象，很多好大好高和喜新厌旧的现象，都应该直接写在领导者的官气和阔气的账上；有些不直接由领导者负责的事情，也表现了领导者疏于检查，也是一种官气为害。机关领导人看了这样的展览会，能够不引起“内疚”、不自我检查、不下决心痛改前非吗？
    同时，这样的展览会也可以教育每一个同志。我看到的展览会都展出了很多的钢笔杆、米达尺、玻璃板、钉书机、铜墨盒、曲别针……和几年、几十年用不完的表格、信封、信笺等；还展出了许许多多的“破烂”家具，有的甚至是崭新的就夭折了，有的新椅子断了腿，有的新闹钟被拆毁了；还展出了成堆的失去了“配偶”的锁头和钥匙……这些现象，难道不是同全机关的同志都有关系吗？一个办公室只有三、四个人办公，却有七、八支钢笔杆，有的还更多；铅笔、毛笔、钢笔头，有了好的不愿意用次的；工作服、手套，用了不洗又领新的；很多机关司机班的修车工具，买了一套又一套；有的机关通讯班的皮衣皮帽不用旧的又买好的；有的同志丢了自来水笔、衣物都不寻找……今天把这些“小东西”一收集起来，竟成了展览会的一个重要部分，你说这不奇怪吗？无论哪一个同志看了这样的展览会，都不能不想到他自己。
    有的同志说，反五气，虽说首先是烧领导上的五气；但是我们每一个同志在这个运动中都必须同时检查一下自己的思想。今天的双反运动不是追查责任的问题，但是从思想上检查，绝不能说同我们自己完全无关。有同志说，有的浪费现象是由于领导上有迁就思想，这不就是说被领导的某些同志也有阔气思想吗？
    每一个同志都应该仔细地看看这样的小型展览会，在这里可以受到极其生动的又极其深刻的社会主义教育。只有大家都来研究浪费现象的原因，大家都从思想上提高一步，才是根绝后患、澄本清源的办法。
