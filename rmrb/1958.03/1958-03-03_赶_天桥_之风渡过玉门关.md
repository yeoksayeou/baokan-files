Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The entire staff of the Urumqi State-Owned Department Store No. 1 and the jointly-owned public-private partnerships of Zhongxing, Tongsheng, and Baihuo Stores proposed conditions on February 27th in response to the initiative of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store, and challenged the state-owned and jointly-owned public-private stores in Urumqi.

The employees of all three units proposed to eliminate the phenomenon of too many people with too little to do, the waste of resources, and poor service quality, changing from a two-shift rotation system to one shift lasting until the job is done. The State-Owned Department Store No. 1 decided to reduce its staff from the current 116 people by 44, with each person's average daily sales target to be raised from 74 yuan in the past to 154 yuan. The personnel of the two joint public-private stores are to be reduced by 40%, and sales are to be increased by two times. The three stores also put forward competition targets for accelerating capital turnover and saving capital.

    赶“天桥”之风渡过玉门关
    据新华社讯　乌鲁木齐市国营第一百货门市部和公私合营中兴、同盛和百货商店的全体职工，在2月27日提出条件，响应北京天桥百货商场的倡议，并向乌鲁木齐市国营和公私合营商店挑战。
    三个单位的职工都提出要消除人多事少、浪费资财和服务质量差的现象，改两班轮流制为一班顶到底。国营第一百货门市部决定从现有一百一十六人中，减去四十四人，每人每天平均卖钱额要由过去的七十四元提高到一百五十四元，两家公私合营商店的人员减少40％，卖钱额要提高两倍。三个商店还提出了加速资金周转、节约资金的竞赛指标。
