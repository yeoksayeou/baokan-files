Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Scientific Planning Commission, Nie Rongzhen, emphasized in his concluding remarks at the Fifth Meeting of the Scientific Planning Commission today: Science must serve the Great Leap Forward in production. He said that now is the time when the Great Leap Forward in production urgently requires a Great Leap Forward in science. To achieve a Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings, it is imperative to clarify the fundamental guideline that science must serve production; science itself is not the goal, and the view of science for science's sake is a very wrong one.

Nie Rongzhen then addressed the question of how science should serve the Great Leap Forward in production.

He pointed out that the most fundamental issue in striving for a Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings is strengthening the scientific ranks, and the main method of strengthening the scientific ranks is rectification. He said that in recent years, under the leadership of the Party, Chinese scientific workers have worked actively and made considerable achievements, and their political and ideological awareness has continuously improved. In particular, after the anti-Rightist and rectification movements, their socialist consciousness has been greatly enhanced. This should be affirmed first and foremost. However, judging from the situations exposed in the rectification campaigns in scientific research institutions and universities, the bourgeois ideological consciousness and work styles of many scientific workers have indeed caused no small damage to the development of China's scientific undertakings. Without carrying out rectification and criticizing these bourgeois ideological consciousness and work styles, it is impossible to achieve a leap forward in scientific work.

Nie Rongzhen said that the ideological struggle between the two lines in scientific work, which we are to resolve in this rectification movement, falls within the scope of contradictions among the people. It is different in nature from the struggle between ourselves and the Rightists last year regarding the two lines in scientific work, and it should never be confused with it. Within the people, there are also many scientific workers who, although they support socialism and the leadership of the Party, are still, due to their class origin and the influence of long-term capitalist education and capitalist working environments, still unwilling to abandon the capitalist road in scientific work, or unwilling or unaccustomed to taking the socialist road. Thus, the ideological struggle between the capitalist and socialist roads is unavoidable. This struggle must be carried through to the end, and the proletarian ideology must thoroughly defeat the bourgeois ideology, in order to promote a Great Leap Forward in scientific work. In addition to the struggle between the two lines in scientific work, there is also the struggle between the two methods of building socialism—the method of more, faster, better, and more economical versus the method of less, slower, worse, and more expensive. However, for the majority of scientific workers today, the question of the two lines is the main and fundamental question. Of course, this does not mean that all the problems of scientists are problems of the two lines. To say so would be simplistic and wrong.

Nie Rongzhen said that the current rectification movement has not only transformed scientific workers but also greatly improved the Party's leadership over scientific work. There are indeed shortcomings in the leadership of scientific undertakings. These shortcomings can be summarized as "not grasping enough, not learning enough." That is to say, in the past, we have not grasped tightly enough in carrying out political and ideological education work for scientific workers, in researching the direction of professional work, in grasping local scientific work and scientific research work in universities, and in promoting the achievements of scientific research. The work of inspection and supervision was also not frequent enough. These shortcomings have been fully exposed during the movement. After several months of rectifying while correcting, the Party's level of leadership over scientific work has also improved.

Finally, Nie Rongzhen talked about several issues of strengthening organizational leadership to promote the Great Leap Forward in China's scientific undertakings. He said: We should give full play to the strength of existing scientific workers. In the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings, the tasks before the older generation of Chinese scientific workers are very important. The country requires them not only to earnestly engage in research work but also to enthusiastically cultivate young cadres, making achievements in both aspects. They must both transform themselves ideologically, striving to become intellectuals of the working class, and continuously improve themselves professionally. The older generation of scientific workers are a valuable asset of our country, but their numbers are ultimately small, and according to natural law, they will gradually decrease or lose their ability to work. Therefore, the cultivation of young scientific cadres must be regarded as the primary task. Chinese scientific workers, whether of the older generation or young cadres, have a common weakness, that is, a lack of practical production experience, and this is the case even for many people who study technical sciences. Therefore, older scientific workers have the problem of going to production to make up lessons. Younger scientific workers should temper themselves in production and in labor. In organizing and mobilizing the scientific workforce, special attention should also be paid to cultivating a large number of cadres in production. A large number of activists in technological innovation have already emerged in industrial and agricultural production. There are already a certain number of veteran cadres with a relatively long period of revolutionary struggle experience doing scientific leadership work, and in the future, the number of such cadres will be even greater. They are an important part of the scientific ranks. The Party and the people require them to become experts who understand a certain branch of scientific knowledge, whether in natural science or in philosophy and social science. This is entirely possible. The way to do this is to learn while doing, as Comrade Chen Boda said at this meeting. Universities possess a strong scientific force. For the Great Leap Forward in scientific undertakings and for the Great Leap Forward in production, it is imperative to mobilize the scientific forces in universities. Local science and technology research work must be actively carried out following the Great Leap Forward in production. This is an indispensable and important aspect of local economic construction plans.

This meeting began on March 5th and concluded today. Twenty-five people spoke at the conference on issues such as scientific work serving the Great Leap Forward in production and the ideological transformation of scientific workers. The meeting discussed and approved in principle the draft outline of the long-term plan for philosophy and social science, and discussed this year's scientific research plan, further improving the conditions for scientific work, and establishing a national scientific information center.

    聂荣臻副总理谈科学工作根本方针
    科学要为生产大跃进服务
    老一辈科学工作者要到生产中去补课，年青的科学工作者更要到劳动中锻炼
    新华社12日讯　国务院副总理、科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻今天在科学规划委员会第五次会议的总结发言中着重指出：科学必须为生产大跃进服务。他说，现在是生产大跃进迫切要求科学大跃进的时候，为了实现我国科学事业的大跃进，就一定要明确科学必须为生产服务这个根本方针；科学本身不是目的，为科学而科学是一种极错误的观点。
    聂荣臻接着谈到了科学怎样为生产大跃进服务的问题。
    他指出，争取我国科学事业大跃进的最根本的问题是加强科学队伍问题，而加强科学队伍的主要方法是整风。他说，几年来我国科学工作者在党的领导下，积极工作，做出了不少的成绩，在政治思想觉悟方面也不断进步，特别是经过反右派和整风运动，社会主义觉悟更大大提高了。这一点是应该首先肯定的。但是，从科学研究机构和高等学校在整风中揭露的情况看来，许多科学工作者的资产阶级思想意识和作风，给我国科学事业的发展带来的损害的确是不小的。不进行整风，不批判这些资产阶级的思想意识和作风，科学工作要实现跃进是不可能的。
    聂荣臻说，我们在这次整风运动中所要解决的科学工作的两条道路的思想斗争问题，是属于人民内部矛盾的范畴。它同去年我们和右派之间关于科学工作两条道路的敌我斗争，性质是不同的，决不应该把它们混为一谈。在人民内部也还有许多科学工作者尽管拥护社会主义和党的领导，但在科学工作中却由于阶级出身，由于长期的资本主义教育和资本主义的工作环境的影响，仍然还不大愿意抛弃科学工作中的资本主义道路，不愿意或者不习惯走社会主义道路。这样，资本主义和社会主义两条道路的思想斗争是不可避免的。这一斗争必须进行到底，无产阶级思想彻底战胜资产阶级思想，才能促进科学工作的大跃进。科学工作中除了两条道路的斗争以外，还有建设社会主义的两种方法——多快好省的方法同少慢差费的方法之间的斗争。不过对于今天大多数科学工作者来说，两条道路问题是主要的、根本的问题，当然，这并不是说，科学家中的一切问题都是两条道路的问题，这样说是简单化的，错误的。
    聂荣臻说，当前的整风运动，不仅改造了科学工作者，也大大改善了党对科学工作的领导。在科学事业的领导工作中，不是没有缺点的。这方面的缺点，概括起来讲就是“抓得不够，学得不够”，这就是说，过去我们在对科学工作者进行政治思想教育工作方面，在对业务工作方向的研究方面，在抓地方科学工作和高等学校科学研究工作方面，在推广科学研究成果方面都抓得不够紧，检查督促的工作也不够经常。在运动中这些缺点已经被充分地揭发出来。经过几个月来的边整边改，党对科学工作的领导水平也有所提高。
    聂荣臻最后谈到了加强组织领导工作来促进我国科学事业大跃进的几个问题。他说：应该充分发挥现有科学工作者的力量。在科学事业大跃进中，摆在我国老一辈的科学工作者面前的任务是很重大的。国家要求他们既要切实从事研究工作，又要热心培养青年干部，在两方面都作出成绩。他们既要在思想上改造自己，努力争取做一个工人阶级的知识分子，又要在业务上不断提高自己。老一辈科学工作者是我们国家宝贵的财产，但是人数终究很少，而且按照自然规律，会逐渐减少或者丧失劳动能力。因此必须把对青年科学干部的培养当作首要的任务。我国科学工作者，不论老一辈的或是年青干部，有一个带普遍性的弱点，那就是缺乏生产实践的经验，即使研究技术科学的人，有不少也是如此。因此老一辈的科学工作者有一个要到生产中去补课的问题。年青的科学工作者，更应该在生产中、在劳动中锻炼自己。在组织和动员科学工作队伍这个问题上，还应该特别注意在生产中大量培养干部，在工农业生产中已经涌现出了大批技术革新的积极分子。现在已经有一定数量的、有比较长时期革命斗争锻炼的老干部在做科学领导工作，将来这样的干部数量还会更多。他们是科学队伍中的一个重要组成部分。党和人民要求他们使自己成为通晓某一门科学知识的专家，不论自然科学方面或是哲学社会科学方面，这都是完全可以做到的，办法就是陈伯达同志在这个会议上所说的边干边学。在高等学校中拥有强大的科学力量。为了科学事业的大跃进，为了生产的大跃进，一定要把高等学校中的科学力量动员起来。地方科学技术研究工作必须跟着生产大跃进积极开展起来，这是地方经济建设计划中不可缺少的一个重要方面。
    这次会议从3月5日开始到今天结束。有二十五人在大会上就科学工作为生产大跃进服务、科学工作者的思想改造等问题发表了意见。会议讨论并原则通过了哲学社会科学长远规划纲要草案，讨论了今年的科学研究计划、进一步改善科学工作条件、建立全国科学情报中心等问题。
