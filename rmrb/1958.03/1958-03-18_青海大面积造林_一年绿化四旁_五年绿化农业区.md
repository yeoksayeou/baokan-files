Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 17th: Two million people in Qinghai Province, spearheaded by 500,000 young people, have begun an activity to green the Qinghai Plateau. People of all ethnic groups living in the warmer Yellow River and Huangshui River basins are carrying out large-scale afforestation by river, mountain range, or valley, county by county, township by township, and commune by commune, dividing the land into sections. This year, the banks of the Yellow River, the 500-li Huangshui River mainstream, and the 1,300-li tributaries within the agricultural area will be planted with trees.

Qinghai Province has determined to green the surroundings in one year and the agricultural areas in five years. This year, it will afforest 1.07 million mu, exceeding the total afforestation area in the twenty years before liberation by twenty times, and more than doubling the afforestation area in the eight years since liberation. The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai first plant fruit trees, arbors, shrubs, or weeds suitable for the local conditions on both sides of the rivers. Areas that cannot yet plant arbors will first plant shrubs or weeds to conserve water and soil. Currently, one-third of the townships and two-fifths of the agricultural cooperatives in the agricultural area have guaranteed to complete the greening of their respective areas this year.

The Qinghai Plateau is the source of the Yellow River, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, dry and windy. The Yellow River banks within the agricultural area have 25,000 square kilometers of areas with serious soil erosion, with approximately 1.8 million tons of fertile topsoil being washed into the Yellow River every year. The greening work will not only change the natural landscape of the Qinghai area but will also play a significant role in permanently controlling the Yellow River.

    青海大面积造林
    一年绿化四旁　五年绿化农业区
    据新华社西宁17日电　青海省两百万人民，由五十万青少年打先锋，开始了绿化青海高原的活动。居住在气候较暖的黄河和湟水流域的各族人民，都在按照一条河流、一条山脉或一条山沟，县联县、乡联乡、社联社，划片分段开展大面积造林。农业区境内的黄河、五百里湟水主流和一千三百里长的支流，今年内两岸都将栽上树木。
    青海省确定一年绿化四旁，五年绿化农业区；今年要造林一百零七万亩，超过解放前二十年间造林总面积的二十倍，比解放后八年来的造林面积多一倍。青海各族人民先在河流两岸因地制宜地栽种果木、乔木、灌木或杂草，暂时还不能栽种乔木的地区就先种灌木或杂草保持水土。现在，农业区已有三分之一的乡镇和五分之二的农业社，保证要在今年内完成本地区的绿化工作。
    青海高原是黄河的发源地，拔海二千公尺以上，干旱多风，农业区境内黄河沿岸有二万五千平方公里水土流失严重的地区，每年约有一百八十万吨肥沃的表土被冲入黄河。绿化工作不仅将使青海地区的自然面貌改观，对于根治黄河也将起很大的作用。
