Xinhua News Agency dispatch: As the peak sales season for daily-use industrial products in rural markets approaches, commercial departments in many regions are reducing orders or even returning goods for some fast-selling and tightly supplied items, such as cotton cloth, woolen underwear, cotton blankets, and rubber shoes, when purchasing from Tianjin. The Tianjin Knitwear and Cotton Goods Purchasing and Supplying Station has received an increasing number of letters and telegrams from various places requesting returns, and the value of returned goods is increasing monthly.

The person in charge of the Tianjin First Commercial Bureau believes that this phenomenon is abnormal. Judging from the reasons given for returning goods or reducing orders from various places, and from the information they have learned, there are roughly two reasons for this phenomenon: One is that some regional commercial departments, seeing the large increase in production materials needed for the great leap forward in agricultural production, have strengthened the procurement and supply of these materials, while paying insufficient attention to the fact that farmers still need a certain amount of living materials. At the same time, they have not sufficiently recognized the characteristic that this year's delayed peak market season may arrive concentratedly. Another possible reason is that, under the current advocacy of the principle of diligence and frugality in running enterprises, some commercial workers in some regions have developed the idea of "fearing stockpiles more than stockouts" and are not maintaining a reasonable level of inventory as required by the Ministry of Commerce.

The person in charge of the commercial department said that one of the characteristics of the current rural market that can be clearly seen is that the sales of daily-use industrial products are very brisk in areas where commercial departments have adapted to the busy winter production of farmers and deliver goods to the countryside. He believes that, except for units where there is indeed too much stock after in-depth investigation and research, the general practice should be to order goods according to plan, and they should immediately change the work style of passively waiting for customers to come to them, actively send people to the countryside to promote sales, and meet the needs of farmers in a timely manner.

    商业工作要防止片面性
    一些退货多要货少的现象是不正常的
    本报特约新华社专稿　正当农村市场日用工业品的销售旺季来临的时候，不少地区商业部门在向天津采购日用工业品中，对于一些畅销和供应比较紧张的商品，如棉布、绒衣裤、棉毯、胶鞋等等，却少要货甚至退货。天津针棉织品采购供应站接到各地要求退货的函电日益增多，退货的金额在逐月增加。
    天津市第一商业局负责人认为这种现象是不正常的。从各地退货或少要货所提的理由以及他们所了解到的情况看来，产生这种现象的原因，大致上有两个：一个是有些地区商业部门看到农业生产大跃进需要的生产资料大大增加，加强了这方面的采购和供应工作，而对农民仍然需要一定数量的生活资料就注意得不够了。同时，对今年推迟了的市场旺季可能集中来到的特点认识不足。另一个可能的原因是，当前提倡勤俭办企业的方针，有些地区的商业工作人员又出现了“怕积压不怕脱销”的思想，而不按商业部的要求保持一定的合理库存。
    商业部门的负责人说，当前农村市场情况已经可以明显看出来的特点之一是：凡是商业部门适应农民冬季生产繁忙、送货下乡的地区，日用工业品的销售就很畅旺。他认为除了经过深入的调查研究，确实是货多了的单位以外，一般的应该按计划进货，并且应该立即改变坐等顾客上门的工作作风，积极主动地派人下乡去推销，适时地满足农民的需要。
