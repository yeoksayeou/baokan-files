Great Leap Forward in Production, Improved Living Standards
A Brief Overview of Songtao Miao Autonomous County

    Songtao Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province was established on December 31, 1956. It is located in the eastern part of Guizhou Province, bordering Hunan Province to the east, Tongren and Jiangkou counties to the south, Yinjiang County to the west, and Xiushan County in Sichuan Province to the north. It covers an area of over 2,100 square kilometers. The population is 291,757, including 80,714 Miao people and 211,043 Han people. The Miao population accounts for slightly less than 28% of the total population. It administers nine districts, eighty-one townships, and one town. The People's Committee is located in Chengguan Town.
    The autonomous county's economy is mainly based on agriculture, followed by forestry. There are many types of cash crops, mainly including flue-cured tobacco, rapeseed, soybeans, and peanuts.
    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the autonomous county has made tremendous achievements in all aspects. In agriculture, by the beginning of 1957, the county had 448 advanced agricultural cooperatives (including 203 ethnic minority cooperatives), accounting for more than 83% of the total number of farming households. Before liberation, farmers were only accustomed to planting single-season crops, and their farming methods were crude. After liberation, this habit gradually changed. In 1957, 41% of the farmland had been converted from single-season to double-season crops. The number of crops sown has reached twenty-nine. In all 663 agricultural cooperatives in the county, the practice of leaving fields with only water during rice planting was eliminated, and each mu of land was fertilized with 5,170 catties of fertilizer. Machine pumping stations were established in Pingzhuangba and Changping, allowing river water to climb up the high slopes. Due to the realization of agricultural cooperation, the cultivated land area was expanded, and farming techniques were improved, agricultural production has developed by leaps and bounds. In 1950, the county's cultivated land area was 376,717 mu; in 1957, it increased to 425,523 mu, an expansion of 13%. Grain output in 1950 was 991,893 dan; in 1956, it increased to 1,543,701 dan, an increase of 55.6%.
    With the continuous development and improvement of production, people's lives have also greatly improved. In 1951, the average purchasing power per person was 12 yuan; in 1957, it had increased to more than 20 yuan. The purchase volume of cloth, in particular, was even greater, increasing by 137% in 1956 compared to 1955.
    The Nidao rural hydropower station is currently under construction. Soon, the people in the towns will begin to use electric lights instead of kerosene lamps.
    In terms of culture, according to statistics in 1957, the county had 192 primary schools (including private primary schools). Ethnic minority districts and townships all have ethnic primary schools. There were a total of 28,182 students enrolled, including 8,030 Miao students, accounting for 28.5% of the total number of students. Most school-age children of ethnic minorities are already in school. The autonomous county originally had one ordinary middle school, and in 1957, another ethnic middle school was established in Panxin District. There are a total of 752 middle school students in the county, including 292 Miao students.
    Great achievements have also been made in the training of ethnic minority cadres. As of 1957, all agencies in the county had Miao cadres. The county's twenty-eight Miao townships and eleven mixed-population townships have all achieved ethnic representation.
    In terms of health, there is currently one hospital, one epidemic prevention team, two maternal and child health stations, health centers in every district of the county, and health rooms or midwife stations in every township. (Xinhua News Agency)

    松桃苗族自治县简况
    贵州省松桃苗族自治县于1956年12月31日成立。位于贵州省的东部，东与湖南省接壤，南与铜仁、江口两县相连，西邻印江县，北接四川省的秀山县。面积二千一百多平方公里。人口共二十九万一千七百五十七人，其中苗族八万零七百一十四人，汉族二十一万一千零四十三人，苗族人口占总人口28％弱。辖九个区、八十一个乡和一个镇。人民委员会驻城关镇。
    自治县的经济以农业为主，其次是林业。经济作物种类很多，主要有土烟、油菜、大豆和花生等。
    几年来自治县在党和人民政府的领导下，各方面都取得了巨大的成就。在农业方面，1957年初全县已有高级农业社四百四十八个（其中少数民族社二百零三个），占总农户的83％以上。解放前农民只习惯种大季，耕作方法粗糙。解放后，这种习惯逐步改变，1957年已有41％的田土由一季变成了双季。播种的农作物已达到二十九种，全县六百六十三个农业社，插秧中消灭了白水田，每亩施肥达五千一百七十斤。在平庄坝和长坪两地建立了机器抽水站，使河水爬上了高坡。由于实现了农业合作化，扩大了耕地面积和改进了耕作技术，农业生产有了飞跃的发展。1950年全县耕地面积三十七万六千七百一十七亩，1957年增加到四十二万五千五百二十三亩，扩大了13％，粮食产量1950年为九十九万一千八百九十三担，1956年增加到一百五十四万三千七百零一担，提高了55.6％。
    随着生产的不断发展和提高，人民的生活也大大提高。1951年每人平均购买力为十二元，1957年已增加到二十元以上，尤其是布的购买量更大，1956年比1955年增加了137％。
    乜刀农村水力发电站，目前正在筹建，不久，城镇人民即将开始用电灯代替煤油灯。
    文化方面，据1957年统计：全县有小学一百九十二所（包括民办小学），少数民族的区、乡都有了民族小学。入学学生共有二万八千一百八十二人，其中苗族学生八千零三十人，占学生总数28.5％，少数民族的适龄儿童已经大都上学。自治县原有普通中学一所，1957年又在盘信区建立了民族中学一所。全县共有中学生七百五十二人，其中苗族学生二百九十二人。
    对民族干部的培养也取得了巨大的成绩，截至1957年，全县各机关都有了苗族干部。县内二十八个苗族乡和十一个杂居乡都已实现了民族化。
    卫生方面，目前已有卫生院一所，防疫队一个，妇婴保健站二个，县内区区有卫生所，乡乡有保健室或者接生站。　（新华社讯）
