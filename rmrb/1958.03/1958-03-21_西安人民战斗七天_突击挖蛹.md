    Xi'an People Fight for Seven Days
    Launching a Sudden Attack to Dig Out Pupae
    More than 1,900 units in Xi'an have achieved the "Four Nos." The people of the city launched a seven-day battle starting from March 4th, concentrating on digging out maggots and pupae. They carried out a general excavation and disinfection of toilets, sewers, slaughterhouses, soy sauce workshops, and other places with many maggots and pupae throughout the city. Now, thousands of PLA soldiers, government cadres, students, and citizens are participating in voluntary labor to dredge the moat. They are preparing to connect the moat with the Wei River, turning stagnant water into flowing water.

    Editor's Note: The climate is gradually warming, which is the breeding season for flies. Xi'an's hard work in digging out maggots and pupae is timely. All localities should also pay attention to taking action as soon as possible.

    西安人民战斗七天
    突击挖蛹
    西安市已有一千九百多个单位实现了四无。全市人民从3月4日起大战七天，集中挖蛆蛹，对全市厕所、阴沟、屠宰场、酱园作坊等多蛆蛹的地方普遍进行了挖掘和消毒。现在每天有数以千计的解放军官兵、机关干部、学生和市民，参加疏通护城河的义务劳动。他们准备把护城河和渭河接通，变死水为活水。

    编者按：目前气候渐暖，正是苍蝇孳生的季节。西安市苦战挖蛆蛹，正是时候。各地也宜及早注意行动。
