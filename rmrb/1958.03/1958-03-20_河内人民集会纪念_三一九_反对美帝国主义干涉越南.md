Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 19th: More than 30,000 Hanoi citizens gathered at the Hanoi Grand Theater Square this afternoon to commemorate the "March 19th" anti-American movement of the people of Saigon and Cholon. Emotionally charged citizens chanted slogans such as "Oppose U.S. imperialist interference in South Vietnam!" and "U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam!"

Nguyen Xuan Thuy, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, and Secretary-General of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, spoke at the rally. He said that eight years ago, the heroic act of 300,000 people in Saigon and Cholon demonstrating against American interventionists and repelling American warships fully demonstrated the Vietnamese people's firm will to oppose American interventionists. Nguyen Xuan Thuy recounted the course of this historical event. He said that the slogan "U.S. imperialism get out!" remains the strong desire and fighting slogan of the Vietnamese people from north to south today. Nguyen Xuan Thuy accused the United States of interfering in all aspects of South Vietnam from the time of the Vietnamese resistance war against France until now. He said, "The problem of Vietnam must be solved by the Vietnamese people themselves."

The conference passed a resolution expressing support for the peaceful initiative proposed by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the South Vietnamese authorities on March 7, and requesting the Southern authorities to express their attitude towards this proposal; demanding an end to U.S. interference in South Vietnam; and demanding early consultations to discuss disarmament and mutual trade issues.

The conference passed a letter to the people of Saigon and Cholon, expressing "warm support" for the "fraternal Southern compatriots'" perseverance in the struggle against the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem's tyranny. Among the presidium of today's conference were Truong Chinh, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnam National Assembly, Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, and leaders of democratic parties.

    河内人民集会纪念“三一九”
    反对美帝国主义干涉越南
    据新华社河内19日电　河内市民三万多人今天下午在河内大戏院广场集会纪念西贡、堤岸人民的“三·一九”反美运动。情绪激昂的市民齐声高呼“反对美帝国主义干涉南越！”、“美帝国主义从南越滚出去！”等口号。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会秘书长、越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席、越南保卫世界和平委员会秘书长阮春水在大会上讲了话。他说，八年前的今天，西贡堤岸三十万人民向美国干涉者举行示威游行并且驱退了美国军舰的英勇行为充分表现了越南人民反对美国干涉者的坚强意志。阮春水回述了这个历史性事件的过程。他说当年提出的“美帝国主义滚出去！”的口号仍然是今天从北到南的越南人民的强烈愿望和斗争口号。阮春水指责美国从越南抗法战争时期直到现在对南越各方面施加的干涉。他说“越南的问题必须由越南人民自己来解决”。
    大会通过决议，表示拥护越南民主共和国政府3月7日向南越当局提出的和平倡议，并且要求南方当局对这个建议表示态度；要求停止美国对南越的干涉；要求早日举行协商来讨论裁军和互通贸易等问题。
    大会通过了一封致西贡、堤岸人民的信，对“亲同骨肉的南方同胞”反对美国和吴庭艳暴政的坚忍斗争表示“热烈支持”。在今天大会的主席团中有越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征、越南国会常务委员会委员长孙德胜、越南总工会主席黄国越和民主党派负责人等。
