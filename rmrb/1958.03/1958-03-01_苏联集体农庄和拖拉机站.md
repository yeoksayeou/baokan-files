Small Statistics

    The first Soviet Machine Tractor Station was established in November 1928 at the Shevchenko State Farm in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

    In 1930, the Soviet Union had only 25,000 tractors in total (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and 7 combine harvesters in its Machine Tractor Stations. Now, there are approximately 9,000 Machine Tractor Stations throughout the Soviet Union, with 1,632,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 420,000 grain combine harvesters, nearly 660,000 trucks, and millions of other complex agricultural machines working on the fields of collective farms and state farms. The Machine Tractor Stations throughout the Soviet Union have a total of 2 million permanent workers, engineering technicians, and agricultural experts.

    Currently, the Soviet Union has approximately 80,000 collective farms and 5,800 state farms, which own approximately 55 million hectares of cultivated land, accounting for nearly 25% of the country's total cultivated land.

    苏联集体农庄和拖拉机站
    苏联的第一个机器拖拉机站是1928年11月在乌克兰加盟共和国舍甫琴科国营农场建立的。
    1930年时，苏联机器拖拉机站总共只有二万五千台拖拉机（每台以十五马力计算）和七台联合收割机。现在，苏联全国大约有九千个机器拖拉机站，在集体农庄和国营农场田地上工作的有一百六十三万二千台拖拉机（每台以十五马力计算）、四十二万台谷物收割联合机、将近六十六万辆载重汽车，数百万架其他复杂的农业机器。苏联全国机器拖拉机站拥有的固定工人、工程技术人员和农业专家共计二百万人。
    目前苏联约有八万个集体农庄和五千八百个国营农场，它们拥有约五千五百万公顷的耕地，即拥有将近国内全部耕地的25％。
