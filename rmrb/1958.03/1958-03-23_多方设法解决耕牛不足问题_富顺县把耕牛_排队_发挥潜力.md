Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 22nd: Fushun County, Sichuan Province, is taking various measures to solve the problem of insufficient cattle power during spring plowing. More than 63% of the county's more than 600,000 mu of paddy fields have been plowed, and more than 90% of the plowed fields have been harrowed. Before the large-scale transplanting of rice seedlings begins at the end of this month, all the paddy fields can be basically plowed and harrowed.

Fushun County's late rice harvest last year was relatively late, and the early rice transplanting this year was advanced by about a month, so the plowing and harrowing of paddy fields was concentrated and time was pressing, making the cattle power seem particularly strained. In order to ensure timely rice transplanting, Party organizations at all levels have helped agricultural cooperatives to queue up their plowing cattle, to maximize the potential of the existing plowing cattle and increase their attendance rate. According to inspections in six districts, over 90% of the more than 20,000 plowing cattle, except for a few old and sick ones, have been put into the fields for plowing and harrowing. The agricultural cooperatives also assign different plowing and harrowing tasks to each plowing cattle according to its physical strength and plowing and harrowing expertise. The Gonghe Agricultural Cooperative in Dinghai Township divides two or three cattle into a mutual aid group, letting the cattle that are good at plowing plow more, the cattle that are good at harrowing harrow more, and the cattle that can walk deep plow the muddy fields; in this way, the labor efficiency of each cattle can be increased by 5% to 10% on average.

During the spring plowing period, all localities have particularly strengthened the feeding and protection of plowing cattle.

In some fields where the cattle power is really insufficient for plowing and harrowing, farmers in various townships have launched a blitz movement to replace cattle with human labor to pull plows. (Attached picture)

The Liming Cooperative in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, which set a national record for high-yield large-area rice production, achieved an average yield of 1,406 jin per mu on more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields last year. This year, it is striving to increase it to 2,420 jin. The members are using row markers (left in the picture) to control the spacing of sowing for direct seeding of rice.

    多方设法解决耕牛不足问题
    富顺县把耕牛“排队”发挥潜力
    据新华社成都22日电  四川省富顺县从多方面设法解决春耕中牛力不足的问题。全县六十多万亩水田已有63％以上犁过了，在犁过的田中又有90％以上耙过了。到本月底大面积开始插秧以前，全部水田就可以基本上犁完耙完。
    富顺县去年晚稻收割较迟，今年早稻栽插又提前一个月左右，水田犁耙工作集中，时间迫促，牛力显得特别紧张。为了保证及时插秧，各级党组织帮助各农业社把耕牛排队，尽可能地发挥现有耕牛的潜力，提高耕牛出勤率。据六个区的检查，两万多头耕牛中，除少数老牛、病牛外，90％以上都已下田犁耙。各农业社还按照每头耕牛的体力和犁耙专长，分别让它担负不同田地的犁耙任务。丁海乡共和农业社把两三头牛编为一个互助组，让善犁的牛多犁，善耙的牛多耙，能走深脚的牛犁烂泥田；这样，平均每头牛可提高劳动效率5％到10％。
    各地在春耕期间特别加强了耕牛的饲养保护工作。
    有些田地牛力实在犁耙不过来，各乡农民就开展以人力代牛拉犁的突击运动。（附图片）
