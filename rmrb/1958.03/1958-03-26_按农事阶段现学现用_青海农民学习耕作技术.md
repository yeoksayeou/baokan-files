    Learning and Applying Farming Techniques According to Agricultural Stages
    Qinghai Peasants Study Farming Techniques
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 26th: In order to guarantee a great leap forward in agricultural production through improved farming techniques, farmers of all ethnic groups on the Qinghai Plateau, according to the agricultural season, have launched waves of technical study in phases. This spring, the learning stage focused on solving various technical problems in spring plowing and sowing. Approximately 14,000 agricultural cooperative members participated in training classes organized by the province, counties, and townships, learning various techniques such as the use of new farm tools, fertilizer production and application, seed mixing and sowing, and pest and disease control. These technicians are playing a technical backbone role in the current spring plowing and sowing. The next stage of learning will focus on various field management techniques. The province, counties, and townships at all levels will continue to organize short-term training classes and demonstrations to promote field management work to catch up.
    In the Qinghai Plateau, each laborer has to cultivate an average of more than eleven mu of land. The farming methods have always been relatively extensive, so improving technology is of particular importance to winning a bumper harvest. In the preparatory production of last winter and this spring, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward that the reliance for a great leap forward in production is "first water, second fertilizer, and third technology," requiring all rural cadres and farmers to learn and improve technology. The agricultural technology departments also determined the method of training rural technicians by learning and applying according to the agricultural stage. In this way, the upsurge of learning technology has been rising wave after wave in the countryside. (Yang Liben)

    按农事阶段现学现用
    青海农民学习耕作技术
    新华社西宁26日专讯　为了在耕作技术上保证农业生产大跃进，青海高原各族农民根据农事季节，划分阶段地掀起一个接一个学习技术的浪头，今年春天以解决春耕播种各项技术问题为主的学习阶段，约有一万四千名农业社社员参加了省、县、乡开办的训练班，学习了新农具使用、造肥施肥、拌种播种、防治病虫害等各种技术。这些技术人员在目前的春耕播种中起着技术骨干作用。下一阶段的学习将以各种田间管理技术为主，省、县、乡各级仍将开办短期训练班和组织观摩，促使田间管理工作迎头赶上。
    青海高原每个劳动力平均要耕种十一亩多土地，耕作方法一向比较粗放，因而改进技术对争取大丰收有特殊重要的意义。在去冬今春的备耕生产中，中共青海省委就提出生产大跃进的依靠是一水二肥三技术，要求全体农村工作干部和农民学习技术和改进技术，农业技术部门也确定了按农事阶段现学现用的训练农村技术员的方法。这样，学习技术的热潮就在农村中一浪接着一浪地鼓了起来。　（杨立本）
