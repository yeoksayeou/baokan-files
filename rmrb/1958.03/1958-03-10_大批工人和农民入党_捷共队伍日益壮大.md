    Large Numbers of Workers and Peasants Join the Party
    The Ranks of the Czechoslovak Communist Party are Growing Stronger
    The Czechoslovak Communist Party's work in developing the party has achieved great success in recent months. During the discussion of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's letter to the people, the industrial center of Ostrava Oblast absorbed more than two thousand new party members, and Prague Oblast developed seven hundred new party members in January alone, exceeding any month in history. Other states have also had hundreds of people applying for and being accepted into the party.

    Half of the new party members are young people under the age of twenty-six, and most are workers. Agricultural workers and members of agricultural cooperatives also account for a large proportion. The addition of these new party members helps to improve the age structure and social composition of the party members, which is what the Czech Communist Party has been calling for to vigorously solve for several years.

    It is no coincidence that thousands of conscious workers applied to join the party when the Czech Communist Party proposed economic restructuring and accelerated the building of socialism. In important historical moments, more people often request to join the party because they are aware of their responsibilities. Secondly, the party organization's better attention to development work is another reason for the achievements. In addition, the Youth League also inspires members' understanding of the party and helps outstanding members join the party through vivid methods. For example, two hundred young people in the Karlovy Vary Oblast became probationary members during this period.

    大批工人和农民入党
    捷共队伍日益壮大
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党发展党的工作近几月来取得了很大成绩。在讨论捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会告人民书的过程中，工业中心俄斯特拉发州吸收了两千多名新党员，布拉格州仅1月份就发展了七百名新党员，超过历史上任何月份。其他各州也有成百的人申请和被接受入党。
    新党员中半数是二十六岁以下的青年，并且大部分是工人。农业工人和农业合作社社员也占很大比例。这些新党员的加入有助于改善党员的年龄情况和社会成分，而这正是捷共几年来号召大力解决的问题。
    在捷共提出经济改组和加速建成社会主义的时候，数千有觉悟的劳动者申请入党，并不是偶然的。在历史上的重大时刻，常常会有更多的人因为意识到自己的职责而要求入党。其次，党组织更好地注意了发展工作，是取得成就的另一个原因。此外，青年联盟也通过生动的方式启发盟员对党的认识，并帮助优秀盟员入党。如卡尔洛瓦尔州在这个期间就有二百青年成为候补党员。
