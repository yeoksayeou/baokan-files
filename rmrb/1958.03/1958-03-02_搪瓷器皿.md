    Enamelware
  　Wang Min
    Enamelware is made by first shaping black iron sheets into a base, then applying enamel powder to the base, and finally firing it at high temperatures. An enamelware item, such as a washbasin, mug, or spittoon, can often last for more than a decade if used carefully.

    How should one choose and protect enamelware?

    I. The inside and outside of enamelware must have a bright color. If the luster is dull, it is not a high-quality product. This is because the luster of enamelware is directly related to the quality of the enamel powder and the degree of firing.

    II. The surface should not have air bubbles or cracks. If there are air bubbles or cracks, it proves that the enamel powder is not firmly bonded to the base, which not only makes it easy for the enamel to chip off but is also unsightly.

    III. When touching the edges of enamelware, if they are smooth, it means there are no broken edges or powder loss.

    IV. Wrinkles on the enamel surface are a sign of firing shrinkage, and such items are not durable.

    When using enamelware, pay attention to the following:

    1. Enamelware is most vulnerable to impact. The part where the enamel surface is chipped off is prone to rust and decay.

    2. Generally, do not use enamelware to hold acidic foods, as enamel is easily corroded by acid.

    3. When using enamelware to cook food, always add water; do not dry-burn it. Dry-burning easily causes the enamel to crack and develop fissures.

    4. To wash enamelware, use water and soap. Never use hard materials such as sand or ashes to scrub it, as this can damage the enamel surface and shorten its lifespan.

    搪瓷器皿
  　王敏
    搪瓷器皿是用黑铁皮做成坯胎，再将珐琅粉搪在坯胎上，经过加高热烧炼而成。一件搪瓷器皿如面盆、口杯、痰盂等，如果注意使用，往往可以用十几年不坏。
    怎样选择和保护搪瓷器皿呢？
    一、搪瓷器皿的内外必须具有光亮的色泽。如果光泽暗淡，就不是上品。因为搪瓷器皿的光泽如何，和珐琅粉的成份好坏以及烧炼的火候程度有直接关系。
    二、表面不应有气泡和裂纹。如有气泡或裂纹，即证明珐琅粉与坯胎结合得不牢固，不但容易掉瓷，而且也不美观。
    三、用手摸搪瓷器皿的边缘部分，如果光滑，就是没有破边或断粉情况。
    四、瓷面有皱纹是烧缩现象，这样的器皿不坚固。
    使用搪瓷器皿时，应该注意：
    1、搪瓷器皿最怕撞击，撞掉瓷面的部分容易生锈腐烂。
    2、一般搪瓷器皿不要盛放酸性食物。因为搪瓷易被酸腐蚀。
    3、用搪瓷器皿烧煮食物必须加水，不要干烧。干烧容易爆瓷，产生裂纹。
    4、洗涤搪瓷器皿可用水和肥皂，千万不要使用砂土、炉灰等较硬的东西去擦洗，以免损伤瓷面、缩短使用时间。
