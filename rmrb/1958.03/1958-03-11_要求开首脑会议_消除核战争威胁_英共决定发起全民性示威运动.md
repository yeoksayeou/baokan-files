Xinhua News Agency, London, March 10th: According to a report in today's London "Daily Worker," the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a meeting on March 8th and decided to launch a nationwide demonstration demanding a summit conference between East and West and the elimination of the threat of nuclear war. The demonstration is scheduled for July 6th in Trafalgar Square, London.

    John Gollan, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, spoke at the Executive Committee meeting, welcoming the Labour Party and the British Trades Union Congress's decision to launch a nationwide campaign on the hydrogen bomb issue recently. He emphasized the need for unity in the Labour movement on this issue and called for increasingly large-scale movements to force the government to agree to a summit conference.

    Gollan outlined the British Communist Party's policy as follows: Britain must not establish rocket bases under any circumstances, cancel American bases in Britain, immediately stop hydrogen bomb testing, hold a summit conference to destroy all nuclear weapons, establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, and conclude a European security treaty.

    Gollan also outlined the current political situation in Britain, pointing out that the foundation of the Conservative government has been shaken and that it can be defeated soon.

    He criticized the Labour Party for inaction at a time when the people are increasingly actively opposed to the government's policies. He said: "The root of this disturbing situation lies in the fact that on many key issues, the Labour Party's official policies are virtually identical to those of the Conservative Party." He pointed out that it is precisely because of the right-wing leadership of the Labour Party that the Labour movement has been paralyzed, allowing the government to continue to rule.

    The meeting also decided to launch a three-month campaign to recruit new members starting in April.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 10th dispatch from London: J.B. Priestley, chairman of the British "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter, advocated that Britain should take the initiative to announce the abolition of nuclear weapons on a certain date, believing that this would help end the nuclear arms race.

    Priestley refuted the idea that disarmament could be achieved only after a balance of nuclear armaments was reached, saying it was a mistaken and absurd view. Priestley said, "As nuclear weapons increase and become more sophisticated and complex, the atmosphere deteriorates, and this will only lead further and further away from a peaceful solution." He also believed that the nuclear arms race has exhausted Britain and that Britain should withdraw from nuclear expansion.

    Priestley also said he did not believe the Soviet Union would attack Britain, saying that the Soviet Union maintained a larger standing army not because it had aggressive intentions but because it feared Western aggression.

    要求开首脑会议　消除核战争威胁
    英共决定发起全民性示威运动
    新华社伦敦10日电　据伦敦“工人日报”今天报道，英国共产党执行委员会3月8日举行了会议，决定发起一次全民性的示威，要求召开东西方最高级会议和消除核战争威胁这次示威订于7月6日在伦敦。特拉法加广场举行。
    英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰在执行委员会会议上发言，表示欢迎工党和英国职工大会决定最近在氢弹问题上展开全国性的运动。他强调指出，劳工运动在这个问题上需要团结，并且要求发动越来越大规模的运动来迫使政府同意召开最高级会议。
    高兰概述了英国共产党的政策如下：英国在任何情况下都不得建立火箭基地，取消在英国的美国基地，立即停止氢弹试验，举行最高级会议以销毁一切核武器，在欧洲建立无原子武器区和缔结欧洲安全条约。
    高兰还概述了目前英国的政治形势，他指出，保守党政府的基础已经动摇，不久就能把它击败。
    他批评工党在人民越来越积极地反对政府的政策的时候却一无作为。他说：“这种令人不安的状况的根源在于：在许多关键性的问题上，工党的官方政策同保守党的政策实质上几乎是完全一样的。”他指出，正是由于工党右翼领导方面使得劳工运动陷入瘫痪状态，政府才能够继续执政。
    会议还决定从4月开始展开三个月的吸收新党员运动。
    新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：英国“争取核裁军运动”主席普里斯特利在单独接见合众社记者时主张英国主动在一定日期宣布废除核武器，他认为这样会有助于结束核军备竞赛。
    普里斯特利驳斥了所谓先达到核军备平衡，然后就能够实现裁军的说法，他说，这是个错误而荒谬的看法。普里斯特利说，“随着核武器的增加和它的愈来愈精巧、愈复杂，气氛就越来越恶化，这样就只会离和平解决越来越遥远。”他还认为，核军备已经使英国精疲力尽，英国应该退出核扩军。
    普里斯特利还说，他不认为苏联会进攻英国，他说，苏联所以保持较大的常备军，不是因为它有侵略意图，而是因为它担心西方的侵略。
