In the winter of 1957, the entire county launched a great leap forward movement in agricultural production centered on water conservancy construction. The scale of this movement was unprecedented, and in one winter and spring, it fundamentally changed the natural appearance of the entire county. The people of the county have full confidence in doubling grain production and reaching and exceeding the target of 400 jin per mu of grain production as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) within this year (reaching 500 jin per mu within this year).

The following is a report on our organization of this great leap forward and our experiences:

I. Grasp the Fundamental Link of Water Management and Organize a Great Leap Forward in Water Conservancy Construction

The masses urgently demanded a fundamental solution to water disasters, but our original ideas on water conservancy construction were not correct. Relying on large-scale projects and the state, we dragged on for two years. Large-scale projects were not completed, and small-scale projects were also delayed. After studying the experience of harnessing the Mang River in November 1957, we changed our approach and resolutely implemented the policy of "emphasizing storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community management." We put forward the action slogan of "treating mountains, plains, and low-lying areas together, combining flood prevention, waterlogging prevention, and drought resistance," and demanded that all surface water be stored, all free-flowing spring water be excavated, and all groundwater be extracted to achieve water conservancy for all cultivated land.

Starting from November 3, 1957, after three stages and two climaxes, and three months of hard work, we have achieved the following main results: treated twenty-seven barren mountain tops, renovated and newly built 25,335 mu of terraced fields, dug 2,257 water cellars, newly built 174 mountain and plain reservoirs, excavated and rebuilt 1,360 pits and ponds (e.g., Nanting Village connected pits and ponds into reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 200,000 cubic meters), opened 14 springs with an output of one flow (striving to excavate seven flows), excavated 146 canals with a total length of 353 li, and newly drilled 163 machine wells (planned to drill 700) and 2,658 other wells. Together with the Shiliu Mountain medium-sized reservoir to be completed before the flood season, the total storage capacity of all projects will be more than 195 million cubic meters. If we encounter floods as large as those in 1954 and droughts as severe as those in 1957 again this year, we can still ensure that the county is free from disasters and achieve a bumper harvest.

More than 80% of the area in our county is plain, and plain reservoirs also account for the majority of the reservoirs built (a total of 123). This type of reservoir is a good form of combining flood prevention, waterlogging prevention, and drought resistance in plain areas and is the most effective measure to quickly change the natural appearance of the plains. It has three major advantages: first, during the flood season, it closes off floods and drainage water, preventing water disasters from shifting, and usually diverts water for irrigation, preventing floods and waterlogging and combating drought. The existing 123 plain reservoirs in our county have a storage capacity of nearly 50 million cubic meters. With the cooperation of upstream projects, they have basically eliminated flood and waterlogging disasters for more than 400,000 mu of land and expanded the irrigated area by more than 100,000 mu; second, the projects are simple, easy to organize, require less investment, and yield quick returns. In addition, the plains have convenient transportation and more labor, so they can be completed in a short period of time. The 123 plain reservoirs that have been completed in our county have a total of 6 million cubic meters of earthwork, which is only 9 cubic meters of earth per mu based on the area affected by the disaster in 1954 (i.e., less than three workdays), which is less labor-intensive and more effective than building ditches and ditches, which is in line with the central government's construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical"; third, the land occupied does not reduce income because plain reservoirs generally do not store water deeply, and manpower can control it. Seasonal water storage can grow early-maturing and water-tolerant crops; perennial water storage can grow reeds, lotus roots, raise fish, and water hyacinth. Willow and Vitex can be planted on the slopes of the dams. Moreover, the land occupied is saline-alkali land, which originally had extremely low yields, and water storage can also be used to silt and improve the soil. In addition, there are no more upstream and downstream disputes caused by drainage. There are two types of plain reservoirs, one mainly for flood storage, which can be called "plain flood storage crop reservoirs," also known as "grape bunch reservoirs"; the other mainly for storing drainage water to prevent waterlogging, which can be called "plain drainage storage crop reservoirs," also known as "starry sky reservoirs."

We believe that water conservancy construction must adhere to the principle of emphasizing small-scale projects. Only by first engaging in small-scale projects can we mobilize the masses. However, when small-scale projects reach a certain level, the masses are no longer satisfied and demand further construction of some medium-sized projects as the backbone of small-scale projects. This is in line with the laws of water conservancy construction work.

In terms of irrigation, we have connected the rivers, reservoirs, pits, and ponds through 146 canals with a total length of 353 li to form an irrigation network. This irrigation network can not only regulate the water volume between the rivers, reservoirs, pits, and ponds, supplementing surpluses and deficits, but also collect drainage water from the plains into reservoirs or discharge it into rivers to avoid waterlogging. We can now command water as desired. This kind of water storage and irrigation system is much better than the ditch network we used to build. In the past, although ditches were built, large floods still inundated the land, and they could only play a simple drainage role and could not resist drought. At the same time, compared with the current projects of interconnected ditches and reservoirs, it is still more labor-intensive.

II. Grasp the Central Link of Solving Feed Problems and Organize a Great Leap Forward in Pig Raising

By the end of January, the county had accumulated 5.26 billion jin of fertilizer, double that of previous years, but the average per mu was still only 6,300 jin. To achieve 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, we must organize a great leap forward in pig raising.

The central link in organizing the great leap forward in pig raising is to solve the difficulty of feed. The solution is still to rely on the masses. The masses said, "Pigs eat a hundred kinds of grass, it depends on whether you can find them." We visited and studied the experience of Anguo, Dingxian, and Boye in pig raising, and organized 32 cadres to trial-produce coarse feed in eight communities. We discovered more than 120 kinds, including corn cobs, cotton bowls, leaves, wild vegetables, grass roots, bean leaves, and rice husks, which can all be used as feed after processing. Through holding exhibitions, it was promoted throughout the county. Now every community has a feed processing station, and the county can produce 240 million jin throughout the year. Based on 1,000 jin per pig, it can raise 240,000 pigs. In addition, we plan to use the edges of fields and dikes to plant 100,000 mu of alfalfa to ensure the supply of feed.

The solution of feed has greatly increased the confidence of cadres and the masses in developing pig raising. We ordered the Commercial Bureau to send people to purchase 280,000 heads of high-quality pig seedlings such as Berkshire from all over the country. In this way, together with the original 37,000 heads, we have reached the requirement of one pig per person. We plan to breed another 260,000 heads by the end of this year, totaling 580,000 heads. After supplying the state with 100,000 heads of fat pigs, there will be 480,000 heads left, an average of one pig for every 0.8 mu of land. In 1959, we require reaching 860,000 heads in the county, an average of one pig per mu of land.

After the rapid increase in pigs, epidemic prevention has become a serious problem. In order to solve this problem, we trained a group of community cadres and middle and primary school graduates (798 people). Now every community has established a livestock guidance section and a livestock clinic, with one "pig doctor" for every 1,000 pigs and one "epidemic prevention officer" for every 500 pigs. In the past three months, a total of 19,320 pigsties have been added and more than 9,000 pigsties have been improved. 80% of the pigsties have established a regular disinfection system. At the same time, each community has purchased necessary epidemic prevention equipment and medicines such as sulfonamides, penicillin, syringes, scalpels, and scissors. The county party committee has also organized the research and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for treating pigs, requiring that pig cholera be basically eliminated within this year.

In order to promptly solve a series of problems brought about by the development of pig raising and effectively do a good job in pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, we have established a livestock production front from the county to the community. The county party committee is responsible for a standing committee member, each township is responsible for a deputy secretary, and the agricultural community is responsible for a community director to specialize in the production of poultry and livestock. In order to cultivate excellent pig breeds and demonstrate, the county has established a pig farm with 1,000 pigs and plans to establish a livestock company specializing in livestock production. In addition to pig raising, we have also established breeding farms for stud cattle, pen sheep, stud horses, domestic rabbits, Leghorn chickens, and dairy farms, preparing to comprehensively promote improved breeds.

From the perspective of the entire county, the vast majority of pigs are still privately owned and raised by community members, and must be gradually transformed into collective ownership. At present, there are 1,762 collective pig farms in the 259 communities in the county, and there are 96 communities with collective pig raising accounting for more than 50%, and there are 13,182 collective pigsties. We plan to actively summarize and promote their experience, and by the autumn of this year, strive to make two-thirds of the pigs in the county collectively owned.

III. In the Great Leap Forward in Production, We Must Help Farmers Master Technology

We have adopted the method of "whatever technical difficulties there are, we will run training classes for that" to specifically impart relevant technical and scientific knowledge. Up to now, we have trained 798 pig breeding and epidemic prevention personnel, 300 fruit tree cultivation personnel, 230 veterinarians, 200 poultry disease treatment personnel, 850 machine (boiler, gas engine, etc.) use and repair personnel, 127 waterwheel transformation personnel (old-style waterwheels transformed into double-pipe, three-pipe, and four-pipe waterwheels), and 380 crop planting technology (sweet potato, corn) personnel. We plan to conduct a training session on the cultivation techniques of various crops. In order to solve the difficulties of cadres not understanding technology, from the county party committee secretary and members to the community cadres, all engage in experimental fields. Preliminary calculations show that a total of 686 mu of experimental fields have been determined in the county, and 18 agency branches have also determined to engage in 3 to 5 mu each. Our experimental fields mainly focus on four crops: corn, wheat, cotton, and sweet potatoes. The crops managed by the cadres are consistent with the crops they experiment with. The county party committee first secretary, Zhang Guozhong, is in charge of corn, the second secretary, Liu Yu, is in charge of wheat, the county head, Li Huanzhang, is in charge of sweet potatoes, and the county party committee deputy secretary, Yang Guohua, is in charge of cotton. The township party committee secretaries, deputy secretaries, township heads, and village branch secretaries and community directors also divide the crops, each with one mu of experimental field. Combining the mastery of production technology with the summary and promotion of relevant advanced experiences, gradually becoming experts in agricultural production. At present, the number of machines in the rural areas of our county, especially power machines, is constantly increasing. There are already more than 200 boilers and gas engines. Except for one mountainous township, all townships have machines, and many townships have steel rollers and steel mills (a total of 111). These machines have brought great convenience to farmers. Farmers' demands for agricultural machinery are also becoming more and more urgent. In addition to continuing to actively purchase a part, we are also preparing to learn from the experience of Qin County, organize agricultural tool factories and small factories to actively imitate and meet the needs of farmers. In addition, we must promptly promote improved agricultural tools.

IV. Carry Out the High-Yield Movement of "100 Mu of Thousand Jin Teams, 1,000 Jin of Grain Per Person, and 10,000 Mu of Double 1,000 Jin"

Based on the experience of several years, planting more high-yield crops and cultivating high-yield land is an important measure to increase yield per unit area. In 1957, more than 53,000 mu of high-yield land with a yield of more than 400 jin per mu and more than 6,000 mu with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu appeared in the county. This gave us great inspiration. We summarized these experiences. Their common points are: key management, concentrated fertilization, and excellent varieties. This year we want to comprehensively promote this experience. The county has determined that each production team will cultivate 100 mu of high-yield land with 1,000 jin of grain per mu and 3 to 5 mu of double 1,000 jin. The county initially plans to cultivate 196,000 mu of 1,000 jin land (accounting for 20% of the total land) and 10,000 mu of double 1,000 jin. This measure has been supported by the broad masses. In the cold climate of minus 8 to 10 degrees Celsius, we launched a "High-Yield Field Management Assault Ten-Day Period" (December 25, 1957 to January 5, 1958). More than 70,000 community members participated in plowing the land every day. Many communities created the method of shallowing and stratified deep plowing at noon and using well water to thaw and deep plow. In ten days, the county deep plowed 130,000 mu of high-yield fields, generally 1.2 feet deep, and all of them were winter irrigated. Fertilization was carried out according to pits and ditches, reaching more than 10,000 jin per mu.

To realize the great leap forward in agriculture, in addition to the above measures, we must first seize the first handle, that is, the bumper harvest of 340,000 mu of wheat in the county. At present, 190,000 mu of wheat have been irrigated, 178,000 mu have been top-dressed, 1.09 billion jin, 250,000 mu have been rolled, and 61,000 mu have been watered with urine. Top-dressing is generally applied once before and after spring plowing, and top-dressing is applied twice on 150,000 mu of large-area high-yield land, requiring the first season of wheat to produce 150 million jin. In addition, we will learn from the experience of Macheng, Hubei, and implement comprehensive intercropping. We will also promote rational close planting, excellent varieties, and improved soil to promote the realization of the great leap forward in agriculture.

V. Grit Our Teeth and Work Hard for Two Years to Change the Appearance of the Entire County

At the beginning of the movement, we repeatedly explained to the farmers: In order to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production, in addition to mobilizing a large number of laborers, we should also grit our teeth, tighten our belts, and endure temporary inconveniences to squeeze out all possible funds and materials to carry out various basic constructions. As long as we work hard for two years, we can completely change the passive situation of frequent natural disasters and low and unstable production levels in our county. The call issued by the county party committee, after a national debate and discussions on whether agricultural production should take slow steps or leap forward, and whether basic construction should be carried out on a large scale or a small scale, was warmly supported by the broad masses and quickly set off a movement of "investing money, investing materials, contributing labor, and contributing plans." Everyone did their best to invest. Incomplete statistics show that cadres not engaged in production have invested more than 28,000 yuan in cash, and middle and primary school teachers have invested more than 30,000 yuan. 80% of the community members have invested materials and cash. By the end of January, the masses in our county had invested a total of more than 6.6 million yuan in funds and materials in agricultural basic construction, accounting for about 24% of the county's total agricultural and sideline income in 1957 and 40% of the net income. If we include the funds of 2 to 3 million yuan that will be paid for purchasing piglets and pig feed, the proportion will be even greater (mainly used for materials for water conservancy construction, purchasing pig seedlings, and machines). A total of more than 4.6 million workdays were completed, with an average of 40 workdays per labor force. More than 12 million cubic meters of earth and stone were completed. The masses took out so much manpower, materials, and financial resources to engage in basic construction, which did not reduce the lives of the masses. What did they get in return? The entire county achieved water conservancy, the rapid increase in pigs, and the reliable material foundation for the great leap forward in agriculture.

VI. In Terms of Leadership Methods: Highlight Key Points, Combine Multilaterally, Divide Battle Lines, and Unify Leadership

The organization of the movement was one climax following another. Each climax had a key point. The first stage was the combination of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and high-yield fields. The second stage was sending manure and watering the land and rectifying the ranks. The third stage was again water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation. Grasping the center, driving various tasks, and making overall arrangements are generally to first engage in key points, then organize visits, then determine specifications, limit deadlines, organize assaults, and complete them in one go. Under the premise of "water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation as the center," various departments carried out work around the center. Although more than 130 cadres were frequently in rural areas and construction sites, no one complained. Some agencies and departments only had three or four or even one or two people to look after the house. Everyone worked together as one, and divisiveness disappeared. Work efficiency was improved, and the enthusiasm of various departments to cooperate and support the great leap forward in agricultural production was greatly strengthened. The Commercial Bureau sent 286 cadres to purchase water conservancy construction materials and piglets, tree seedlings, and seeds worth 9 million yuan in three months. Handicraft communities and factories repaired more than 19,000 various agricultural tools and improved more than 2,600 waterwheels. The political and legal departments handled and solved no less than 100 cases, effectively cracking down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. More than 600 medical personnel went deep into rural areas and construction sites to carry out health campaigns. Middle and primary school teachers also actively wrote slogans and carried out propaganda to promote the development of the movement. Under the premise of highlighting key points and combining multilaterally, we divided into two battle lines from top to bottom. One is the agricultural production battle line; the other is the livestock production battle line. Agriculture and animal husbandry implemented a dedicated person responsible system according to crops and varieties. From the county party committee to the branch, the work was divided according to crops, and professional meetings were held to make the leadership more in-depth and specific.

The second problem in leadership is to strengthen the front line, mobilize positive factors, and sweep away all negative, skeptical, and conservative stagnancy. The countryside is the front line, the township level is the combat company and team, and the county party committee is the headquarters. In addition to maintaining the strong leadership of the "headquarters" (county party committee), we transferred 255 cadres from various agencies and departments from the county level (a total of 789 cadres) to the townships. These cadres are all activists. A total of more than 120 section-level cadres from various agencies were transferred, including the most active 40 cadres. All of the original 40 district secretaries and district heads were placed in the townships. Generally, each township has an average of three to five secretaries, and the 36 townships were merged into 25 townships. Now the strength of the townships is stronger than the previous districts. Each village basically has one cadre. The original 164 township cadres, except for 18 who were left behind, were all placed in the community teams, serving as village branch secretaries, community directors, and production team leaders. The strength of the grassroots has been greatly enhanced. Now the leadership of the rural areas is in the hands of activists who are absolutely loyal to socialism. The township party committee secretaries of six rightists and one negative element were removed from their positions (including two county party committee members). A large-scale debate was held on 19 county and township cadres who were negative, irresponsible, and not working, and more than 330 village and community cadres were adjusted through rectification, purifying the ranks and enhancing combat effectiveness. Most of the county party committee secretaries and county party committee members went to the countryside, and the time spent in the countryside accounted for more than two-thirds of the total working time. But this does not hinder collective leadership. On the contrary, it promotes collective leadership. "Personal thinking, brainstorming research, meeting decisions, and immediate action" is a leadership method we often adopt. County party committee meetings are sometimes held on the mountains and sometimes on the reservoirs. The office has become a mobile staff. Of course, a serious summary must be carried out after the end of a climax, the ranks must be rectified, and criticism and self-criticism must be carried out, so that the work is full of vigor and the enthusiasm is getting higher and higher.

In order to promote enthusiasm and make one climax follow another, we also adopted the method of organizing visits, evaluations, and criticisms and commendations at any time. In these three months, we organized a total of five large-scale visits with more than 4,700 people, and various townships and communities organized 350 times with more than 16,000 people. 62,000 people (including 73 county cadres, 198 township cadres, 1,396 village and community cadres, and the rest were all community members) were commended, and 13,906 people received material rewards.

In the three-month movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, we also had some shortcomings. For example, 20,300 piglets died due to improper management and feeding; some phenomena of coercion and command occurred in individual townships and communities. Due to day and night construction, the grain of individual households was somewhat tight. Not much sideline production was carried out. We have taken and are taking measures to solve the above problems as soon as possible to make the movement more perfect and healthy.

    苦战三月改变全县自然面貌
    中共河北省徐水县委第一书记　张国忠
    1957年冬季，全县开展了以水利建设为中心的农业生产大跃进运动。这个运动的规模是空前的，在一个冬春就基本上改变了全县的自然面貌。全县人民已有充分信心，把粮食产量提高一倍，在今年一年内达到并超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产粮食四百斤的指标（今年内亩产达到五百斤）。
    兹将我们组织这一大跃进的情况和经验报告如下：
    一、抓住治水的根本环节，组织水利建设的大跃进
    群众迫切要求根治水患，但是我们原来的水利建设思想不对头，依靠大型，依靠国家，拖了两年，大型没搞成，小型也耽误了。1957年11月学习了漭河治理经验以后，才转变过来，坚决贯彻“以蓄为主、以小型为主、以社办为主”的方针，提出了“山区、平原、洼地一齐治，防洪、防涝、抗旱结合搞”的行动口号，并要求把地上水全部蓄起来，把自流泉水全部挖出来，把地下水抽出来，以实现全部耕地水利化。
    从1957年11月3日开始，经过三个阶段，两个高潮，苦战三月，我们已取得了以下主要成绩：治了二十七个荒山头，整修及新建梯田二万五千三百三十五亩，挖水窖二千二百五十七个，新修山区水库及平原水库一百七十四座，开挖与改建坑、塘一千三百六十处，（如南亭村把坑塘连成水库，可蓄水二十多万方）开泉十四处，已出水一个流量（争取挖出七个流量），开挖渠道一百四十六条，全长三百五十三华里，新打成机井一百六十三眼（计划挖到七百眼）及其他井二千六百五十八眼，加上将于汛期前完成的石榴山中型水库，全部工程总计可蓄水一亿九千五百多万方。如果今年再遇到1954年那样大的水和1957年那样的大旱，仍能保证全县免除灾害，获得丰收。
    我县百分之八十以上的面积是平原，所修水库中，平原作物水库也占多数（共一百二十三座）。这种水库是平原地区防洪、防涝、抗旱结合搞的好形式，是迅速改变平原自然面貌的最有效的措施。它有三大好处：第一、汛期把洪水和沥水关起来，防止水患搬家，平时引出浇地，防了洪、涝又抗了旱。我县现有的一百二十三座平原水库，蓄水近五千万方，在上游工程配合下，基本上解除了四十余万亩地的洪涝灾害，又扩大灌溉面积十多万亩；第二、工程简单，容易举办，花钱少，收益快；加上平原地交通方便，劳力较多等条件，可以短期内建成。我县已完成的一百二十三座平原水库，共六百万土方，以1954年受灾面积计，一亩地仅九方土（即不到三个工），比搞沟洫费工少，收效大，这正符合中央“多、快、好、省”的建设方针；第三、所占土地，并不减少收益，因为平原水库一般蓄水不深，而且人力可以控制，季节性蓄水的可以种早熟和耐涝作物；常年蓄水的可以栽苇、藕、养鱼、水浮莲等等。坝坡可以种柳条、荆条。而且所占土地都是盐、碱地，原来产量极低，蓄水后还可以放淤改良土壤。此外，因排水而引起的上、下游纠纷也没有了。平原水库有两种，一种以蓄洪为主，可以叫做“平原蓄洪作物水库”，又叫“葡萄串水库”；一种以蓄沥水防涝为主，可以叫做“平原蓄沥作物水库”，又叫“满天星水库”。
    我们认为水利建设必须坚持以小型为主的方针，只有先搞小型，才能发动群众，但在小型工程达到一定程度时，群众就不满足了，就要求进一步兴办一些中型工程，作为小型的骨干，这是合乎水利建设工作的规律的。
    在灌溉方面，我们已通过共长达三百五十三华里的一百四十六条渠道把各河道、水库、坑塘联系起来，组织成一个灌溉网。这个灌溉网既可以调节各河、库、坑塘之间的水量，互补余欠，又可以把平原的沥水汇入水库或泄入河道，避免涝灾，我们对于水能够指挥如意了。这样的蓄水和灌溉系统，比我们过去所搞的沟洫网要好得多，过去虽然修了沟洫，但大水一来仍然淹了地，而且只能单纯地起排泄作用，不能抵抗旱灾，同时较之目前我们所搞的这种沟沟相通，库库相连的工程，还要费工。
    二、抓住解决饲料的中心环节，组织养猪的大跃进
    全县到1月底已积肥五十二亿六千万斤，比往年增加了一倍，但每亩平均还只有六千三百斤，要实现每亩万斤肥，就必须组织养猪的大跃进。
    组织养猪大跃进的中心环节，是解决饲料的困难。解决的办法，仍然是依靠群众。群众说：“猪吃百样草，看你找不找。”我们参观学习了安国、定县、博野养猪的经验，组织了三十二名干部到八个社去试制粗饲料，发现了玉米骨、棉花碗、树叶、野菜、草根、豆叶、稻皮等等一百二十多种，经过加工都可作为饲料。通过举办展览推广到了全县。现在社社都有饲料加工站，全县全年可搞到二亿四千万斤。以每头猪一千斤计算，即可养二十四万头猪。此外，打算利用田边，地埂种植十万亩苜蓿，以保证饲料的供应。
    饲料的解决，大大提高了干部、群众发展养猪的信心。我们责成商业局派人到全国各地采购到巴克夏等优良猪秧二十八万头。这样，连同原有三万七千头，即达到了每人一头猪的要求。计划到今年年底再繁殖二十六万头，共达五十八万头，除供应国家十万头肥猪外，尚余四十八万头，平均每一亩八分地一头猪，1959年要求达到全县八十六万头，平均一亩地一头猪。
    猪只迅速增加后，防疫工作即成为严重问题，为了解决这个问题，我们把一部分社干和中、小学毕业生进行了训练（七百九十八人）。现在每个社都建立了畜牧指导股和畜牧诊疗所，每一千头猪有一名“猪医生”，每五百头猪有一名“防疫员”。三个月来共增猪圈一万九千三百二十个，改良猪圈九千多个。有80％的猪圈建立了经常的消毒制度。同时各社均购置了磺安、盘尼西林、注射器、手术刀、剪子等必要的防疫器械和药品；县委并组织了中药土方治猪的研究利用，要求在今年内就基本消灭猪瘟。
    为了及时解决发展养猪所带来的一系列问题，切实作好养猪积肥的工作，我们从县到社建立了一条畜牧生产战线，县委由一个常委负责、各乡一个副书记负责、农业社由一个社长负责分工专管家禽、家畜生产。为了培养优良猪种及示范，县里建立了一个千头猪的养猪场，并计划成立一个畜牧公司，专管畜牧生产。除养猪外，我们还建立了站牛、圈羊、种马、家兔、来亨鸡等良种繁殖场和奶牛场，准备良种全面推广。
    从全县看来，猪只的绝大部分还是由社员私有私养，必须逐步转为以集体所有为主。目前全县二百五十九个社中有一千七百六十二个集体养猪场，集体养猪在50％以上的有九十六个社，集体猪圈有一万三千一百八十二个。我们打算积极总结推广他们的经验，到今年秋季，争取全县三分之二的猪成为集体所有。
    三、在生产大跃进中，必须帮助农民掌握技术
    我们采取了“什么技术困难，就办什么训练班”的办法，专门传授有关的技术和科学知识。到现在为止，已训练了猪的饲养、防疫人员七百九十八名，培育果树人员三百名，兽医二百三十名，治家禽病的二百名，使用与修理机器（锅驼机、煤气机等）人员八百五十名，改造水车（旧式水车改成双管、三管、四管水车）人员一百二十七名，传授农作物的种植技术的（甘薯、玉米）三百八十名，计划对各种作物的栽培技术都进行一次训练。为了解决干部不懂技术的困难，从县委书记、委员到社干部都搞试验田，初步计算全县已确定的试验田共六百八十六亩，十八个机关支部也确定各搞三、五亩。我们的试验田以玉米、小麦、棉花、红薯等四种为主，干部分管的作物与他试验的作物一致。县委第一书记张国忠专管玉米，第二书记刘裕管小麦，县长李焕章管红薯，县委副书记杨国华管棉花。各乡的乡党委书记、副书记、乡长和村支部书记、社主任也分作物，每人一亩试验田。把掌握生产技术与总结、推广有关的先进经验结合起来，逐步成为农业生产的内行。目前我县农村里的机器，特别是动力机器在不断增加着，已有锅驼机、煤气机等二百多台，除一个山区乡外，乡乡都有机器，不少乡有了钢碾、钢磨（共一百十一台）。这些机器为农民带来了很大的方便。农民对农业机器的要求也愈来愈迫切。我们除继续积极采购一部分外，并准备学习沁县的经验，组织农具工厂及小工厂积极仿制，满足农民的这一要求。此外，还要及时推广改良农具。
    四、开展“百亩千斤队，每人千斤粮，万亩双千斤”的高额丰产运动
    根据几年来的经验，多种高产作物，培养高额丰产地是提高单位面积产量的重要措施。1957年全县出现了亩产四百斤以上的丰产地五万三千多亩，亩产千斤以上的六千多亩。这给我们很大启示，我们把这些经验总结起来，它的共同点是：重点管理，集中施肥，优良品种。今年我们要全面推广这一经验，全县确定每个生产队培养一百亩亩产千斤粮的丰产地和三、五亩双千斤。全县初步定为培养十九万六千亩千斤地（占总地20％），一万亩双千斤。这一措施受到了广大群众的拥护，在摄氏零下八至十度的寒冷气候下，开展了丰产田管理突击旬（1957年12月25日至1958年1月5日），每天有七万多名社员参加刨地，很多社创造了中午浅化分层深耕和用井水解冻深翻的办法，十天功夫全县深刨丰产田十三万亩，一般深度一尺二寸上下，并全部进行了冬灌，按坑、按沟施肥每亩达一万斤以上。
    实现农业大跃进，除上述措施外，我们首先还要抓住第一把，即全县三十四万亩小麦的丰收。现在小麦浇水已达十九万亩，追肥十七万八千亩，十亿九千万斤，轧耙二十五万亩，浇尿六万一千多亩，春耕前后普遍追一次肥，十五万亩大面丰产追二次肥，要求第一季小麦产到一亿五千万斤。除此，学习湖北麻城经验，实行全面间作。并推广合理密植、优良品种、改良土壤，促进农业大跃进的实现。
    五、咬紧牙关，苦战二年，改变全县面貌
    运动一开始，我们即反复向农民说明：为了农业生产大跃进，除了要出动大批的劳动力外，还应咬紧牙关，节衣缩食，忍受一时的不便，挤出一切可以挤出的资金、物料，以进行各项基本建设，只要苦战二年，完全改变我县自然灾害频繁、生产水平低且不稳的被动局面，县委发出的这个号召，经过了全民大辩论，讨论了农业生产是慢步走还是跳跃前进，基本建设是大搞还是小搞等问题之后，得到广大群众的热烈支持，迅速掀起了“有钱投资、有物投料、有人出工、有计献计”的运动，大家尽最大力量来投资。不完全统计，全县脱产干部已投出现款二万八千多元，中、小学教员投资三万多元，有80％的社员投了物料和现款。到1月底，我县群众在农业基本建设方面共投入资金和物料六百六十多万元，约占1957年全县农副业总收入的24％，占纯收入的40％。如果把将要付出二、三百万元的购买小猪及猪饲料款计算进去，比重就还要大一些（主要是用于水利建设的物料，采购猪秧和机器）。共做了四百六十多万个工，每个劳力平均四十个工。完成土、石方一千二百多万方。群众拿出这么多的人力、物力、财力来搞基本建设，并没有降低了群众的生活，而换来的是什么呢？是全县实现了水利化，是猪只的飞速增加，是农业大跃进有了可靠的物质基础。
    六、在领导方法上是：重点突出、多边结合、划分战线、统一领导
    运动的组织是一个高潮紧接着一个高潮，每个高潮都有重点，第一阶段是水利、积肥结合丰产田；第二阶段是送粪浇地、整顿队伍；第三阶段又是水利、积肥。抓住中心，把各项工作带动起来，加以通盘安排，一般是先搞重点，再组织参观，然后定出规格，限定期限，组织突击，一气呵成。在“水利、积肥为中心”的前提下，各个部门去围绕中心进行工作，虽然抽一百三十多名干部经常在农村、工地上，但没有叫苦的，有的机关、部门只剩三、四个甚至一、两个人看家，上下一致拧成了一股绳，分散主义没有了，工作效率提高了，各部门通力合作支援农业生产大跃进的干劲大大加强了。商业局派二百八十六名干部，三个月采购水利建设物资和小猪、树秧、籽种等价值达九百万元，手工业社、工厂修理各种农具一万九千多件，改良水车二千六百多架，政法部门处理、破获案件不下百余起，有力地打击了地、富、反、坏的破坏活动，六百多名医务人员深入农村、工地开展卫生运动。中、小学教职员也积极刷写标语，进行宣传鼓动，促进了运动的发展。在重点突出、多边结合的前提下，我们从上到下划分成了两条战线。一条是农业生产战线；另一条是畜牧生产战线。农业、畜牧分作物、分种类实行了专人负责制，从县委到支部按作物分了工，召开专业会议，使领导更加深入、具体。
    领导中的第二个问题，是加强第一线，调动积极因素，扫掉一切消极、怀疑、保守的暮气。农村是第一线，乡级是作战连、队，县委是司令部。我们除保持了“司令部”（县委）的坚强领导外，从县级（共七百八十九名干部）从各机关各部门抽调二百五十五名干部下派到了乡。这些干部都是积极分子。各机关共一百二十多名科长级干部，下派了其中最积极的四十多名，原四十多名区书、区长全部放到了乡，一般每乡平均三、五个书记，并把三十六个乡并成了二十五个乡，现在乡的力量比过去的区都雄厚。每村基本达到了一名干部。原一百六十四名乡干部，除留下了十八名外，全部放到了社队，担任村支书、社主任、生产队长。基层力量大大增强了。现在农村的领导权掌握在了绝对忠于社会主义的积极分子手里。撤掉了六名右派、一名消极分子的乡党委书记的职务（包括二名县委），对十九名消极、皮沓、不干工作的县、乡干部进行了大会辩论，通过整风调整了三百三十多名村、社干部，清洗了坏分子，纯洁了队伍，增强了战斗力。县委书记和县委委员大部下乡，下乡时间占全部工作时间三分之二以上。但这并不妨碍集体领导，相反促进了集体领导，“个人琢磨、碰头研究、开会决定，立即行动。”是我们经常采取的一种领导方法，县委会议有时在山上开，有时在水库上开，办公室成了流动参谋。当然一次高潮结束要进行一次认真总结，整顿队伍，开展批评与自我批评，这样使工作富有朝气，干劲愈来愈足。
    为促进干劲，使一个高潮紧接一个高潮，我们还采用了随时组织参观、评比、批评表扬的方法。在这三个月中我们共组织大型参观五次四千七百多人，各乡、社组织三百五十次一万六千多人，有六万二千多人（其中县干部七十三人，乡干部一百九十八名，村、社干部一千三百九十六名，其余全是社员）受到了表扬，一万三千九百零六人受到了物质奖励。
    三个月来以水利、积肥为中心的运动中，我们也曾发生一些缺点，例如，由于管理、饲养不当曾死亡小猪二万零三百头；个别乡社发生一些强迫命令现象，由于日夜搞工程，个别户粮食发生偏紧现象，副业生产搞的不多，对上述问题我们已经和正在采取措施抓紧解决，使运动更加完善、健康地发展下去。
