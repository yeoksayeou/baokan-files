    Unprecedented Self-Criticism
    Ge De
    The enthusiasm of Shanghai workers in opposing waste and conservatism is very high. It is said that about 30 million fiery big-character posters have been put up. Although I have not personally experienced the scene, I have felt the atmosphere from the newspapers. The physical exhibition held by the workers seems to be right in front of me: a wide central avenue leading from the gate to the various workshops, where workers have brought various materials they have wasted, 350,000 items in total, lined up for more than two li. The avenue is filled with exhibits. The factory gate is full of vehicles of all sizes, the wide walkways are crowded with people, and more than 10,000 people are watching. The workers themselves wrote the descriptions and acted as guides, explaining how they wasted these things, how regrettable the waste was, and what lessons they learned. Around them are plastered about 20,000 big-character posters, with comparisons, exposures, criticisms, and suggestions. What a warm and moving scene!
    I can't find anything in my memory that can compare to this. I am reluctantly reminded of the "Flower Market" at rural temple fairs. The entire street is lined with various stalls. Tourists and pedestrians throng, and hawkers stretch their voices and shout, eagerly welcoming customers. The factory market during the Spring Festival is almost the same, but there is no singing in the loud hawking. Small vendors work so hard, of course, to sell their goods. So, what are those workers standing in front of the exhibits doing it for?
    Of course, they are also trying to sell their things. But not the things in front of them, but valuable experiences. Since the entire country and the entire class have paid tens of thousands of yuan for such lessons, how can we not try to make them shared by the entire country and the entire class? A sense of class responsibility prompts them to come forward, bring out the physical objects, and explain the lessons to the public. And in turn, they attack waste and conservatism, the bureaucracy and stagnation of leadership, burning away the bad things that corrode the interests of the class and the country. The gains are far greater than the cost of selling those things.
    However, this is also an incredibly courageous self-criticism from the bottom up by the working class. This is true self-criticism.
    Some people have said that we are not democratic. The examples cited are that we are afraid of criticism and lack a spirit of self-criticism. For example, they say that we are "afraid of exposing the dark side," especially afraid of concentrating on revealing this dark side. The working class has answered this question with its own actions. Aren't these shocking wastes dark things? Isn't this us, the workers, who took the initiative to bring them out for exhibition? Isn't this concentrated enough?
    In history, which other class has had such great courage? May I ask those who claim to be brave in criticism and self-criticism, have they ever dared to take out the real evidence of their own shortcomings and mistakes, like the workers, and conduct frank self-criticism in public?
    Our working class has indeed rejected the kind of "criticism" that glares with triangular eyes and grinds its teeth. Because their purpose is to boost their morale and diminish our prestige, to undermine our positive and upward spirit. They also reused the criticism method of Song Yu, the pampered favorite of the King of Chu, called "attack one point, exaggerate as much as possible, without mentioning the rest." They say that everything about us is bad, rotten, pitch black, and good for nothing, in order to achieve their goal of overthrowing us. This is a false, or "ulterior motive" criticism and self-criticism. Of course, some may not have such bad intentions, but their methods still adopt Song Yu's approach. This kind of bad criticism and self-criticism should also be viewed critically.
    Now our good, real self-criticism is on display. "Not afraid of not knowing the goods, just afraid of comparing goods," this is indeed a different kind of thing. First, it uses the method of comparing the advanced to show the direction of progress, inspiring people's confidence and courage to move forward; second, because it uses the method of exposing the opposite, it makes those conservative ideas that are good at hiding nowhere to hide, just like the newspaper reporter said: "It makes the conservative and complacent almost thinking suffer a devastating blow." Third, this criticism starts from the facts and is targeted, with no intention of sensationalism, and even less of a "attack one point without mentioning the rest" intention; fourth, this criticism is also full of a high degree of self-criticism, educating others and educating themselves. Our workers dare to put "350,000 items" together for a concentrated display, because they know in their hearts that while there has been waste, they have also contributed more than thousands and thousands of "350,000 items" to society. Although there is no need to be proud of this, it is indeed a clear conscience. Naturally, they also feel pain for the shortcomings and mistakes, but they also understand that these shortcomings and mistakes are actually just a hair on the body, at most one finger out of ten. Of course, we will not let this go, will not tolerate it, "suppress and search," beat the drums and attack it, but this shows the never-ending enterprising spirit of our class, the strict self-demands of our class, and the unparalleled and enormous sense of responsibility of our class to the whole society. At the same time, it is also the determination of our class to declare war on all conservative traditions in society. Such a spirit is unprecedented, and no class dares to compare with it. I am proud to be a member of the working class, and I am inspired by the great spirit of our class.
    This real criticism is the self-criticism of the working class, and it is the self-criticism of the entire class. This criticism sets a precedent and will inevitably affect the whole country and become the criticism of the whole people. We will always need this criticism. Because it boosts our morale and gives us unparalleled benefits.

    史无前例的自我批评
    葛德
    上海职工们反浪费反保守的劲头大得很。据说，火辣的大字报就贴出了约三千万张。我虽未曾亲历其景，但已经从报纸上感受到了那种气息。工人们举办的那实物展览会，好像也就摆在我的眼前：一条宽阔的从大门通往各车间的中心大道，工人们搬来了自己浪费过的各种物资，有三十五万件，连接起来有二里多长，都摆在大道上。工厂门口停满了大小车辆，宽阔走道上人群拥挤，一万多人围观着，工人们自己写了说明书，自己当讲解员。讲的是自己如何浪费了这些东西，浪费了又多可惜，所得的教训又是什么？周围还满贴着约二万张大字报，有对比，有揭发，有批评，有建议。这是怎样一种热烈感人的景象啊。
    我从记忆中找寻不出同这可以比拟的东西。勉强地想到了乡间庙会上的“花红市”。整条街道两旁，为各种各样的摊子摆满。游客行人熙攘，小商小贩们拉长嗓子高声叫卖，殷勤招待顾客。春节期间的厂甸，差不多也是这样，不过在大声的叫卖中没有听到歌唱罢了。小商小贩们如此卖力，当然是为了售出自己的货品。那末，守在展览品前的那些职工，又是为了什么呢？
    当然也是为了卖出自己的东西。不过不是守在面前的那东西，而是宝贵的经验。既然整个国家，整个阶级用了数以万元计的高价，买得了这样的经验教训，怎能不设法把它变成整个国家和整个阶级所共有的呢？一种阶级的责任感，促使他们挺身而出，搬出实物来当众向人们讲解这教训了。而且反过来又向浪费和保守，领导上的官气和暮气进攻，烧掉那些腐蚀着阶级和国家利益的坏东西。这收获远比卖出那东西的代价要大的多。
    然而，这又是一个无比勇敢的阶级的自下而上地自我批评。这是真正的自我批评。
    有人曾经说我们不民主。举出的例子就是说我们害怕批评，缺乏自我批评精神。比如，说我们“怕揭出阴暗面”，特别害怕集中地揭示这阴暗面。工人阶级用自己的行动来回答这个问题了。难道这些触目惊心的浪费还不是阴暗的东西？难道这不是我们工人自己动手把它搬出来展览的？难道这还不集中？
    历史上还能有哪一阶级能有这样大的勇气？请问那些自称是勇于批评和自我批评的人，可曾敢像工人这样，把自己的缺点和错误的真凭实据拿出来，当众进行坦率的自我批评？
    我们工人阶级的确拒绝过那种瞪起三角眼来咬牙切齿的“批评”。因为他们的目的是要长他们的志气，灭我们的威风，要败坏我们积极向上的情绪。他们又袭用了楚王的那个小白脸宠臣宋玉的批评方法，叫作“攻其一点，尽量夸大，不及其余”。说我们什么都是坏的、糟的，漆黑一团，一无是处，以达其打倒我们的目的。这是一种假的，或者叫作“别有用心”的批评和自我批评。自然有的居心或者没有这样坏，但其方法仍然还是采用了宋玉的那一套。这种坏的批评和自我批评，也是应当批判地看待的。
    现在我们的好的、真的自我批评摆出来了。“不怕不识货，就怕货比货”，这的确是货色不同。第一，它用了比先进的办法来展示了前进的方向，激励了人们上进的信心和勇气；第二，因为用了树立对立面的揭发办法，就使那些善于隐形的保守思想也无处容身，就像报纸记者说的那样：“使保守自满的差不多思想遭到毁灭性打击。”第三，这批评从事实出发，有的放矢，绝没有哗众取宠之意，更没有“攻其一点不及其余”之心；第四，这批评又充满了高度的自我批评精神，教育别人也教育自己。我们的工人敢把“三十五万件”集中的摆出来，这是他们心里有底，知道在这浪费的同时，也经过他们的手给社会贡献了何止万千个“三十五万件”的东西。这虽无须去骄傲，但这的确是问心无愧的。对于缺点和错误自然也痛心，但也明白这缺点和错误其实不过是人身的一毛一发，充其量不过是十个指头中的一个指头。我们对这当然也不放过，不容忍，“清剿搜查”，鸣鼓而攻，不过这显示的是我们这个阶级永无休止的进取精神，我们这个阶级自我要求之严，我们这个阶级对整个社会的无比的巨大责任心。同时也是我们这个阶级向社会上一切保守的传统宣战的决心。这样一种精神是史无前例的，也是没有哪个阶级敢与比较的。我以自己是工人阶级的一分子感到光荣，我为我们阶级的这种伟大精神感到振奋。
    这真的批评是工人阶级的自我批评，而且是整个阶级的自我批评。这种批评开风气之先，又必至影响及于全国，成为全民的批评。这批评我们永远需要。因为它长了我们的志气，使我们从中取得了无比的好处。
