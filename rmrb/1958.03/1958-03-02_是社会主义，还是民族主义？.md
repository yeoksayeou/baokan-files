Report by Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, at the meeting of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee on rectifying the work style and conducting socialist education among minority nationalities.
Xinhua News Agency report: Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, delivered a report on February 9th at the Fifth Enlarged Meeting of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee on the issue of rectifying work style and conducting socialist education among minority nationalities. The original text of the report is as follows.
Comrades, members of the committee:
I, on behalf of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, will make a report on the issue of rectifying work style and conducting socialist education among minority nationalities. Please review it.

	(I)

Since the nationalities work symposium held in Qingdao in July 1957 by the Nationalities Committee and the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the party committees and governments in relevant regions, under the leadership of the Central Committee, have successively launched a campaign of rectifying work style and socialist education focusing on opposing nationalism among minority nationalities, in accordance with the instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. In those minority nationality areas that have basically achieved the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, a large-scale debate on the two roads of capitalism and socialism is underway within and outside the Party, among cadres and the masses of the people, combined with the criticism of local nationalism, debating the major issues of right and wrong regarding the capitalist and socialist paths, and the nationalist and socialist stances, and carrying out the struggle against the rightists; in those minority nationality areas that have basically completed democratic reforms and have begun to carry out socialist transformation, measures suitable to local conditions are being taken to conduct education on socialism and patriotism among cadres and the people; and in those minority nationality areas that have not yet carried out democratic reforms and are directly transitioning to socialism, socialist and patriotic propaganda and education are also being conducted positively among cadres and the people.

The face of minority nationality areas has undergone fundamental changes, and economic and cultural undertakings have grown from nothing to something, and from small to large, laying a good foundation for the great leap forward of all nationalities. However, local nationalism has experienced renewed growth in many minority nationalities.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and through the efforts of the people and cadres of all nationalities, the achievements of nationalities work have been enormous. Regional autonomy has been implemented for more than 90% of the minority nationality population living in concentrated communities; more than 85% of the minority nationality population has basically achieved the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production; more than 400 modern industrial enterprises have been established in minority nationality areas; a contingent of nearly 200,000 minority nationality workers is being trained; the agricultural, pastoral, forestry, economic, cultural and educational undertakings of minority nationalities have developed to varying degrees; the people's living standards have improved to a certain extent; more than 400,000 minority nationality cadres are undertaking various tasks; and 450,000 minority nationality working people and intellectuals have been absorbed into the Communist Party. Due to the above achievements, the face of minority nationalities has undergone fundamental changes, and the unity among nationalities has been strengthened unprecedentedly on a new basis. Now, people can clearly see the flourishing development scene appearing in all minority nationalities. In particular, in those minority nationalities that have never had large factories or even handicraft workshops, modern industries have emerged; in those minority nationalities that have unique languages but have never had writing systems, they have their own national writing systems or are designing writing schemes; in those minority nationalities that have never had a primary school, a hospital, or a store, many schools, hospitals, and stores have appeared; in those areas that have always been isolated from transportation, railways or highways have appeared; in those areas that have never had economic and cultural centers, new cities have appeared; and in those minority nationalities whose population has been declining, new signs of population growth have emerged. The above achievements and changes fully demonstrate the correctness of the Communist Party's and Chairman Mao's nationalities policy. There is no doubt that these achievements and changes have laid a good foundation for the great leap forward of all nationalities. However, the minority nationality people have not been without difficulties on the road to victory, and it should be said that there are many difficulties. It is worth pointing out that since the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically realized in the vast majority of minority nationality areas, local nationalism has experienced renewed growth. Judging from the materials exposed in this rectification campaign, this ideology has not only grown in certain minority nationalities, but has grown in many minority nationalities; it not only has obvious manifestations among some people outside the Party, but also has serious reflections within the Party; even some high-ranking cadres of certain minority nationalities have this ideological tendency. In some people, local nationalism has even developed to a particularly serious and particularly egregious degree.

Local nationalism is prominently manifested in the following three aspects:

First, on the issue of national regional autonomy, regardless of historical development and realistic conditions, administrative regions of autonomous areas and the administrative status of autonomous areas are demanded to be expanded without principle, and in some places, there are even serious separatist tendencies attempting to separate from the motherland's big family.

Second, in ethnic relations, they are conservative and xenophobic, opposing unity and cooperation among nationalities, especially excluding Han cadres and Han people, not welcoming Han assistance, and refusing to learn from advanced nationalities.

Third, on the issue of the construction of the Communist Party, in violation of the Party's unity and the principles of communism, they attempt to divide the Party's organization based on the principles of bourgeois nationalism, believing that Party members of other nationalities cannot seek happiness for their own nationalities, and that only Party members of their own nationalities can seek happiness for their own nationalities, demanding that Party organizations be divided according to ethnic composition, and adopting an attitude of exclusion towards Party members of other nationalities from outside who participate in local Party organizations, especially opposing Party members of other nationalities from outside taking on leadership responsibilities in local Party organizations.

In minority nationalities, it is equally necessary to follow the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front with a socialist revolution in politics and ideology. The struggle against local nationalism is an important aspect of this revolution.

Why has local nationalism experienced renewed growth in the vast majority of minority nationality areas in our country after the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically realized? This is certainly not accidental. From the national perspective, the change in the ownership of the means of production has basically solved the problem of the socialist revolution on the economic front, but it has not solved and cannot solve the problem of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Because after the change in the ownership of the means of production, the question of who wins and who loses in the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism has not yet been resolved, and this struggle remains the main contradiction of the transition period. The most prominent manifestation of this contradiction is that the bourgeoisie and their intellectuals are still not convinced, or not completely convinced, by the change in ownership and the leading position of the proletariat, and some of them even attempt to seize the leadership of the Communist Party and restore the capitalist system. This situation is no exception in minority nationalities. The growth of local nationalism reflects the resistance and opposition of a portion of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting class elements in minority nationalities who are unwilling to accept transformation to socialism.

It can be seen that in minority nationalities, it is equally necessary to follow the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front with a socialist revolution in politics and ideology. The struggle against local nationalism is an important aspect of this revolution. Is it socialism or nationalism? This is a fundamental issue related to the destiny of all minority nationalities, and it is also a major issue related to the unity and consolidation of the great motherland. If this issue is not resolved, the socialist revolution in politics and ideology in minority nationalities cannot achieve victory, the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities cannot be consolidated, the socialist system in minority nationality areas cannot be strengthened, and the prosperity and development of all nationalities will be hindered.

Since the opposition to local nationalism is an integral part of the struggle between the two roads, this contradiction must inevitably manifest itself as a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy in certain ranges, and as a contradiction among the people in other ranges. Local nationalists are bourgeois rightists in ethnic clothing, that is, reactionary elements who oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and undermine the unity of the motherland and national solidarity, and feudal remnants who are unwilling to accept transformation. These people are mainly a portion of the bourgeoisie, bourgeois intellectuals, and other exploiting class elements. They are a very small minority in all nationalities and in their respective class strata. Their contradiction with us is a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. They must be thoroughly exposed and criticized, and completely isolated. Under the current conditions in our country, although the method of stating the facts and reasoning can generally be adopted in dealing with the contradictions between nationalists and us instead of the method of subjugation, their contradiction with us is still a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. People with local nationalist tendencies are different from local nationalist elements. Although such people also have some erroneous thoughts and statements on issues such as the socialist system, the leadership of the Communist Party, the unity of the motherland, and national solidarity, and some even sympathize with and accept some viewpoints of nationalist elements to varying degrees, they can generally accept the leadership of the Communist Party and support the socialist system, and can support the unity of the motherland and national solidarity. Their main characteristic is vacillating between socialism and nationalism. Such people are the majority among the bourgeoisie, bourgeois intellectuals, and people who have separated from other exploiting classes and cooperate with us in all nationalities. Their contradiction with us is a contradiction among the people. In dealing with them, we must, based on the principle of unity-criticism-unity, sincerely point out their shortcomings and errors in a gentle and reasonable manner, and patiently guide them to overcome these shortcomings and errors, striving for their continuous progress and active participation in the struggle against local nationalism. It must be pointed out that winning over those in the middle is an extremely important task, and only by winning over those in the middle can the movement develop healthily and achieve complete victory. It is necessary to pay special attention here that in the struggle against local nationalism, a strict distinction must be made between two types of contradictions with different natures. We must not ignore the existence of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and say that the contradictions between nationalist elements and us are contradictions among the people; nor can we exaggerate the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and treat the contradictions between people with local nationalist tendencies and us as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy.

Local nationalism and great Han chauvinism are both bourgeois ideologies, both fundamentally incompatible with socialism, and both should be resolutely opposed. In the past few years, the Party has emphasized opposing great Han chauvinism among the Han nationality, and in the two national ethnic policy implementation inspections in 1952 and 1956, it focused on criticizing great Han chauvinism, which was entirely necessary. Of course, great Han chauvinism tendencies still exist to this day, and are still quite serious in some areas. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to resolutely oppose great Han chauvinism in the future. However, at present, when local nationalism in many minority nationalities is manifesting itself so prominently and has become a dangerous tendency worthy of serious vigilance, it is very necessary to emphasize opposing local nationalism in minority nationalities.

	(II)

Vigorously guide minority nationality cadres and people to distinguish clearly between the major issues of right and wrong on the socialist and nationalist stands. The socialist stand safeguards the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities; the nationalist stand harms or even splits the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities.

In this movement, great efforts must be made to guide the broad masses of minority nationality cadres and people to clearly distinguish between the major issues of right and wrong on the socialist and nationalist stands, so as to universally raise socialist and patriotic consciousness, thoroughly isolate national reactionaries, and achieve the goals of consolidating the socialist system, strengthening the Party's leadership, and further consolidating the unity of the motherland and national solidarity. So, what are the major issues of right and wrong between the socialist and nationalist stands, that is, their fundamental differences?

First, in the attitude towards the unified family of the motherland and domestic ethnic relations, the socialist stand safeguards the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities, while the nationalist stand harms or even splits the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities. This is the first fundamental difference between them.

The unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities are the fundamental guarantees for building socialism. In our country's more than 600 million population, the Han nationality accounts for more than 94%, and its politics, economy, and culture are also relatively developed, but the area it distributes is less than half of the total area of the country; although the minority nationality population only accounts for 6% of the country's total population, its politics, economy, and culture are generally less developed, but the area it distributes accounts for more than half of the country's total area, and its resources are very rich. Due to the results of historical development, all nationalities are mostly interspersed and mixed, and the economic exchanges between all nationalities are very close, and an inseparable whole has long been formed. This situation determines that all nationalities in our country must unite and help each other to build socialism together. If any nationality leaves the motherland's big family and separates from the help of other nationalities, wanting to develop independently is not only contrary to the fundamental interests of its own people, but also fundamentally impossible to achieve. Therefore, only within the unified family of the motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, can all nationalities in our country unite closely, help each other, support each other, learn from each other's strengths, and successfully build socialism, so that their own nationalities can develop and prosper. This is one.

Second, the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities are the basic guarantee for the people of all nationalities to be free from imperialist aggression. Imperialism has long invaded our country, and at that time it was a big mountain pressing on the heads of the people of all nationalities in China. It was only by relying on the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the arduous struggle of the people of the whole country that this big mountain was overthrown, so that all nationalities were jointly liberated. However, imperialism is unwilling to accept defeat, and they are still doing everything possible to provoke relations between all nationalities in our country, conspiring to create divisions between nationalities, in order to achieve the goal of making a comeback and enslaving all nationalities in our country. For example, the US and British imperialists buying over a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet to engage in activities for what they call an "independent country," raising the heads of the great Turkic movement in Xinjiang, such as Isa and Emin, who fled to engage in what they call the "East Turkestan" movement, and directing the exiled war trafficker Ma Bufang and others among the Hui nationality to conspire to establish what they call a "Taiwan on the mainland" in the Hui nationality areas in the northwest, are all clear examples. Of course, these conspiracies of imperialism are opposed to the death by the people of all nationalities in our country, and they are also destined to never succeed. The people of all nationalities in our country all recognize that only by uniting closely with each other can they have sufficiently powerful defense forces to prevent them from suffering imperialist aggression. If any nationality practices separation, it will not only inevitably lose the great achievements of national liberation and national equality that have already been achieved, but also inevitably fall back into the shackles of imperialism.

Third, the unity of the motherland and national solidarity are the fundamental requirements of China's historical development. In the very distant historical era, our country had already established a centralized multi-ethnic state. In the long-term coexistence, all nationalities have developed economic ties and cultural exchanges, and have repeatedly jointly resisted foreign aggression, thereby jointly defending and developing the territory of the motherland, and jointly creating the history and culture of the motherland. Although the system of national oppression once existed in history, causing estrangement between nationalities, the ties between the people of all nationalities have still been continuously developed. In the past hundred years, imperialist invasion of China has closely linked the fates of all nationalities, especially in the people's great revolution led by the Communist Party of China in the past thirty years, the friendship between the people of all nationalities has been further strengthened. This long-term historical development in our country has formed an irresistible inevitable trend, which is the trend of all nationalities jointly establishing a unified people's China. It was on this historical basis that all nationalities in our country established the unified People's Republic of China in 1949. If that nationality wants to practice separation, it violates this long-term historical development trend and its fundamental requirements.

If any nationality leaves the motherland's big family, it will definitely leave the road of socialism and embark on the road of imperialist colonies. The socialist road is the road to national prosperity; the road of imperialist colonies is the road to national decline. There is no middle road.

The above situation fully demonstrates this truth: only by uniting within the unified big family of the motherland can all nationalities in our country build socialism, and can they resist imperialism. If any nationality leaves the motherland's big family, it will definitely leave the road of socialism and embark on the road of imperialist colonies. Either the road of socialism, which is a road of national prosperity; or the road of imperialist colonies, which is a road of national decline; there is no middle road.

The above situation also fully demonstrates that the separatist doctrine of so-called "independent nation-building" can only benefit imperialism and not the people of all nationalities. Moreover, this separatist doctrine in many cases seems to be a stick, and when one end of it appears domestically, it is not difficult to find the other end abroad. The "independence" activities in Tibet are a prominent example in this regard.

Among national separatist doctrines, there is also the idea of establishing a union republic and an autonomous republic in our country. This is also completely wrong.

The development of history has only provided the economic and political basis for all nationalities in our country to implement national regional autonomy and establish autonomous regions within a unified country, but it has not provided any conditions for establishing a federation. May I ask how can the Han nationality, which accounts for 94% of the country's total population, and dozens of minority nationalities, which only account for 6% of the country's total population, separately establish their own union republics and autonomous republics? Under the historically formed distribution of various nationalities mostly interspersed and mixed, how can the regional boundaries of the republics of various nationalities be divided? How can the unified socio-economic whole of various nationalities formed in history be divided? Obviously, the federal system is not suitable for our country's situation, nor is it conducive to the development interests of the people of all nationalities in our country.

Facts have proved that our adoption of a unitary state system, rather than a federal system, and the implementation of a national regional autonomy policy under a unitary state system can perfectly solve the national problem in our country. National regional autonomy can not only realize the right of minority nationalities to be masters of their own affairs, enabling them to develop and prosper their own nationalities in accordance with the state and their own conditions, but also can unite all fraternal nationalities in a unified big country on the political basis of completely equal status and rights, and implement mutual assistance and cooperation to jointly manage their own country and develop their own country, thus being more conducive to the development of their own nationalities. The work of promoting national regional autonomy is still continuing. This year, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will be established in the first half of the year. This is a major event in our country's political life, and it is also another great victory for our country's national policy, especially the establishment of these two autonomous regions in the struggle against nationalism, which is even more significant.

On the issue of regional autonomy, there was an erroneous phenomenon at the beginning of the rectification campaign, that is, regardless of the unified leadership of the state, regardless of realistic conditions and historical conditions, demanding to expand the area of autonomous areas and increase the administrative status of autonomous areas without principle. All national autonomous areas are an inseparable part of the motherland, and must respect the unified leadership of the state. Any idea that opposes the unified leadership of the state to the rights of autonomy is wrong. The region and administrative status of autonomous areas must be determined based on ethnic population, ethnic relations, economic development and other conditions, and with reference to historical circumstances. Demanding "high" and "large" in this regard without principle will inevitably harm the unity of the state and national solidarity, and must be opposed. (To be continued)

    是社会主义，还是民族主义？
    民族事务委员会副主任汪锋在人大民族委员会会议上关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育问题的报告
    据新华社讯　民族事务委员会副主任汪锋，2月9日在全国人民代表大会民族委员会第五次扩大会议上，作了关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育问题的报告。报告原文如下。各位委员、各位同志：
    我代表民族事务委员会作关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育问题的报告。请审议。
                    （一）
    自从1957年7月民族委员会和民族事务委员会在青岛召开的民族工作座谈会以后，有关地区的党委和政府在中央的领导下，根据党的三中全会的指示，在少数民族中相继开展了一个以反对民族主义为重点的整风和社会主义教育运动。在那些基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的少数民族地区，在党内、党外，在干部和人民群众中，都正在进行一次大规模的关于资本主义和社会主义两条道路的大辩论，结合批判地方民族主义，辩论关于资本主义和社会主义道路、民族主义和社会主义立场方面的大是大非，并且进行反右派斗争；在那些基本上完成了民主改革并已开始进行社会主义改造的少数民族地区，正在采取适合当地情况的方式，在干部和人民中进行社会主义和爱国主义的教育；在那些还没有进行民主改革和直接向社会主义过渡的少数民族地区，也正在干部和人民中，正面进行社会主义和爱国主义的宣传教育。
    少数民族地区的面貌发生了根本性的变化，经济、文化事业从无到有，从少到多，已为各民族的大跃进奠定了良好基础。但是在许多少数民族中地方民族主义有了新的滋长。
    过去几年来，在党和政府的领导下，经过各民族人民和各民族干部的努力，民族工作的成绩是很巨大的。90％以上聚居的少数民族人口实行了区域自治；85％以上的少数民族人口基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造；有四百多个现代工业已经在少数民族地区建立；有将近二十万人的少数民族工人队伍正在培养起来；少数民族的农、牧、林业经济和文化教育事业有了不同程度的发展；人民生活有了一定的提高；有四十多万少数民族的干部担负着各种工作；有四十五万少数民族的劳动人民和知识分子已经被吸收成为共产党员。由于以上的成就，少数民族的面貌发生了根本性的变化，民族间的团结也在新的基础上得到了空前的加强。现在，人们都可以明显地看到各少数民族中出现的种种欣欣向荣的发展景象。特别是在那些从来没有大工厂甚至没有手工业工场的少数民族中，出现了现代工业；在那些有独特语言而从来没有文字的少数民族中，有了自己的民族的文字或者正在设计文字方案；在那些从来没有一所小学、一所医院和一所商店的少数民族中，出现了许多学校、医院和商店；在那些从来是交通闭塞的地区，出现了铁路或公路；在那些从来没有经济、文化中心的地区，出现了新的城市；在那些人口一直下降的少数民族中，出现了人口上升的新气象。上述的成绩和变化，充分说明共产党和毛主席民族政策的正确。毫无疑问，这些成绩和变化，已为各民族的大跃进奠定了良好的基础。但是，在少数民族人民胜利前进的道路上，并不是没有遇到困难的，应该说困难是不少的。值得指出的是，自从绝大部分少数民族地区基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，地方民族主义有了新的滋长。从这次整风中揭发的材料看来，这种思想不只是在某几个少数民族中有了滋长，而是在许多少数民族中有了滋长；它不仅在党外的一些人员中有着明显的表现，而且在党内也有严重的反映；甚至在某些少数民族的高级干部中也有人存在着这种思想倾向。地方民族主义还在有些人中间已经发展到特别严重、特别恶劣的程度。
    地方民族主义突出地表现在以下三个方面：
    一在民族区域自治问题上，不顾历史发展和现实条件，无原则地要求扩大自治地方的行政区域和自治地方的行政地位，有些地方甚至还存在着企图从祖国大家庭中分离出去的严重的分离主义倾向。
    二在民族关系上保守排外，反对民族间的团结合作，特别是排斥汉族干部和汉族人民，不欢迎汉族的帮助，拒绝向先进的民族学习。
    三在共产党的建设问题上，违背党的统一团结和共产主义原则，企图以资产阶级民族主义的原则来分裂党的组织，认为其他民族出身的党员不能为自己的民族谋幸福，只有本民族的党员才能为本民族谋幸福，要求按民族成分划分党的组织，对外来的其他民族的党员参加当地党组织采取排斥态度，特别是反对外来的其他民族的党员在当地党组织内担负领导责任。
    在少数民族中同样地必须接着经济战线的社会主义革命的胜利，进行一次政治上和思想上的社会主义革命。而反对地方民族主义的斗争是这个革命的一个重要方面。
    为什么在我国绝大部分少数民族地区基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造以后，地方民族主义反而有了新的滋长呢？这当然绝不是偶然的。就全国来说，生产资料所有制的改变，基本上解决了经济战线上的社会主义革命问题，但是，没有解决也不可能解决政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命问题。因为生产资料所有制改变以后，社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争谁胜谁负的问题还没有解决，而且这个斗争依然是过渡时期的主要矛盾。这种矛盾最突出的表现就是资产阶级和他们的知识分子，对所有制的改变和无产阶级的领导地位还不心服，或者不完全心服，他们中的一部分人甚至企图夺取共产党的领导权，使资本主义制度复辟。这种情况在少数民族中也不例外。地方民族主义的滋长就是反映了少数民族中一部分不愿意接受改造的资产阶级分子和其他剥削阶级分子对社会主义的抵触和反对。
    可见在少数民族中，同样地必须接着经济战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，进行一次政治上和思想上的社会主义革命。而反对地方民族主义的斗争是这个革命的一个重要方面。究竟是社会主义，还是民族主义？这是关系各少数民族命运的根本问题，也是关系伟大祖国的统一和巩固的重大问题。如果不解决这个问题，少数民族中政治、思想方面的社会主义革命就不能取得胜利，祖国的统一和各民族的团结就不能巩固，少数民族地区的社会主义制度就不能加强，而各民族的繁荣和发展也要受到阻碍。
    反对地方民族主义既然是两条道路斗争的一个组成部分，那么这种矛盾在某些范围内就必然表现为敌我矛盾，而在其他范围内则表现为人民内部的矛盾。地方民族主义者是披着民族外衣的资产阶级右派分子，也就是反对社会主义、反对共产党领导、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的反动分子和不愿意接受改造的封建残余分子。这种人主要是资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子和其他剥削阶级分子里头的一部分。他们在各民族中和在他们所属的阶级阶层中，都是极少数。他们同我们的矛盾是敌我矛盾。对他们必须进行彻底的揭露和批判，并使他们完全孤立起来。在我国目前的条件下，对待民族主义者同我们的矛盾，虽然一般地也可以采取摆事实、讲道理的方法而不采取压服的方法，但是他们同我们的矛盾仍然是敌我矛盾。有地方民族主义倾向的人，和地方民族主义分子是不同的，这种人在关于社会主义制度、共产党领导、祖国统一和民族团结等问题上虽然也有一些错误的思想和言论，有的并且或多或少地同情和接受了民族主义分子的一些观点，但是，他们一般是可以接受共产党的领导和拥护社会主义制度，并且可以是拥护祖国统一和民族团结的。他们的主要特点是在社会主义和民族主义之间左右摇摆。这种人在各民族的资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子和从其他剥削阶级分化出来的、同我们合作共事的人们当中，是大多数。他们同我们的矛盾是人民内部的矛盾。对他们必须根据团结——批评——团结的原则，用心平气和地讲道理的方法，诚恳地指明他们的缺点和错误，循循善诱地引导他们克服这些缺点和错误，争取他们不断进步积极参加反对地方民族主义的斗争。必须指出，争取处于中间状态的人是一个极为重要的任务，只有把处于中间状态的人争取过来，才能使运动健康的发展，并取得完满的胜利。这里需要特别注意的就是在反对地方民族主义的斗争中，对两类不同性质的矛盾必须严格加以区别。既不能忽视敌我矛盾的存在，把民族主义分子同我们的矛盾说成是人民内部的矛盾；也不能夸大敌我矛盾，把有地方民族主义倾向的人同我们的矛盾当作敌我矛盾去处理。
    地方民族主义和大汉族主义都是资产阶级思想，都是同社会主义根本不相容的，都应当坚决反对。过去几年党曾经强调反对汉族中的大汉族主义，并且在1952和1956年两次全国民族政策执行情况的检查中，着重批判了大汉族主义，这是完全必要的。当然，大汉族主义倾向至今仍然存在，有的地区并且还相当严重。因此，今后也仍然要继续坚决反对大汉族主义。但是，在目前许多少数民族中的地方民族主义表现得如此突出，并且成为一种值得严重警惕的危险倾向的时候，在少数民族中强调反对地方民族主义就是很必要的了。
                  （二）
    大力引导少数民族干部和人民划清社会主义立场和民族主义立场方面的大是大非。社会主义立场维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结；民族主义立场损害甚至分裂祖国的统一和各民族的团结。
    在这次运动中，必须用很大的力量，引导广大的少数民族干部和人民划清社会主义立场和民族主义立场方面的大是大非，以便普遍提高社会主义和爱国主义觉悟，彻底孤立民族反动派，达到巩固社会主义制度、加强党的领导、进一步巩固祖国统一和民族团结的目的。那么，社会主义立场和民族主义立场方面的大是大非也就是它们的根本分歧，究竟在什么地方呢？
    首先，在对待统一的祖国大家庭和国内民族关系的态度上，社会主义立场维护祖国的统一和各民族的团结，民族主义立场损害甚至分裂祖国的统一和各民族的团结，这就是它们之间的第一个根本的分歧。
    祖国的统一和各民族的团结是建设社会主义的根本保证。在我国的六亿多人口中，汉族占94％以上，它的政治、经济、文化也比较发展，但是它分布的地区还不到全国总面积的一半；少数民族人口虽然只占全国总人口的6％，它的政治、经济、文化一般也比较不发展，但是它分布的地区却占全国总面积的一半以上，资源又很丰富。由于历史发展的结果，各民族又多是交错杂居的，各民族在经济上的往来也十分密切，早已形成了不可分割的整体。这种情况，决定了我国各民族必须团结互助，共同建设社会主义。任何民族如果离开祖国大家庭，脱离其他民族的帮助，要想单独得到发展，都不仅是违背本民族人民的根本利益的，而且也是根本不能实现的。所以，我国各民族只有在统一的祖国大家庭内，在中国共产党的领导下，紧密地团结起来，互相帮助，互相支援，取长补短，才能成功地建设社会主义，才能使自己的民族得到发展和繁荣。这是一。
    第二、祖国的统一和各民族的团结是各民族人民免于帝国主义侵略的基本保障。帝国主义曾经长期地侵略过我们国家，那时它是压在中国各民族人民头上的一座大山，只是依靠着共产党的正确领导和全国人民的艰苦奋斗，才把这座大山推翻，从而使各民族共同获得了解放。但是帝国主义是不甘心失败的，他们还在千方百计地挑拨我国各民族的关系，阴谋制造民族间的分裂，以便达到卷土重来，奴役我国各民族的目的。例如美英帝国主义者收买西藏的一小撮反动分子搞什么“独立国”活动，豢养新疆逃亡的大土耳其主义头子艾沙、伊敏等搞什么“东土耳其斯坦”运动，指使回族中流亡的战贩马步芳等阴谋在西北回族地区建立什么“大陆上的台湾”等等，就是明证。当然，帝国主义的这些阴谋是我国各民族人民誓死反对的，也是注定永远不能得逞的。我国各民族人民都认定，只有亲密地互相团结在一起，才能有足够强大的保卫力量，使他们免于遭受帝国主义的侵略。任何民族，如果实行分离，就不仅必然要失去已经得到的民族解放和民族平等的伟大成果，而且也必然要重新落入帝国主义的枷锁之中。
    第三、祖国的统一和民族团结是我国历史发展的根本要求。我国在很远的历史时代，就已经建立了中央集权制的多民族国家。各民族在长期的相处中，发展了经济上的联系和文化上的交流，并且多次联合抵抗了外来的侵略，从而共同保卫和开拓了祖国的领土，共同创造了祖国的历史和文化。尽管历史上曾经存在过民族压迫制度，造成了民族间的隔阂，但是各民族人民间的联系，仍然得到了不断的发展。近百年来，帝国主义侵入中国，使各民族的命运密切联系在一起，特别是在最近三十多年来中国共产党领导的人民大革命中，各民族人民的友谊更进一步地加强了。我国这种长期的历史发展，形成了一种不可抗拒的必然趋势，这就是各民族共同建立统一的人民中国的趋势。就在这个历史基础上，我国各民族在1949年建立了统一的中华人民共和国。如果那个民族要实行分离，就违反了这个长期的历史发展趋势和它的根本要求。
    任何民族如果离开祖国大家庭，就一定会离开社会主义的道路，走上帝国主义殖民地的道路。社会主义道路是民族繁荣的道路；帝国主义殖民地的道路是民族衰亡的道路。中间道路是没有的。
    上述的情况充分说明了这样一个真理：我国各民族只有团结在统一的祖国大家庭之内，才能建设社会主义，也才能抵御帝国主义，任何民族如果离开祖国大家庭，就一定会离开社会主义的道路，走上帝国主义殖民地的道路。要末是社会主义的道路，这是一条民族繁荣的道路；要末是帝国主义殖民地的道路，这是一条民族衰亡的道路；中间道路是没有的。
    上述的情况也充分说明所谓“独立建国”的分离主义只能有利于帝国主义，而不利于各民族人民。而且这种分离主义在许多情况下好像是一条棒子，它的一端在国内出现时，另一端就不难在国外发现。西藏的“独立”活动就是这方面的一个显著例子。
    在民族分离主义中，还有一种要在我国建立加盟共和国和自治共和国的思想。这也是十分错误的。
    历史的发展给我国各民族只提供了在统一的国家内实行民族区域自治建立自治地方的经济和政治基础，而没有提供任何建立联邦的条件。试问占全国总人口94％的汉族和仅占全国总人口6％的几十种少数民族怎样能够分别建立自己的加盟共和国和自治共和国呢？在历史形成的各民族多数交错杂居的分布状况下怎样能够划分出各个民族的共和国的区域界线呢？历史形成的各民族统一的社会经济整体又怎样能够把它分割开呢？很显然，联邦制是不适合我国情况的，也是不利于我国各民族人民发展利益的。
    事实证明，我们采取单一的国家制度，而不采取联邦制度，并且在单一的国家制度下实行民族的区域自治政策，是能够完满地解决我国的民族问题的。民族的区域自治既可以实现少数民族当家作主的权利，使他们按照国家和自己的情况发展和繁荣自己的民族，又可以在完全平等的地位和权利的政治基础上，把各兄弟民族团结在统一的大国内，实行互助合作，共同管理自己的国家和发展自己的国家，因而更有利于各民族自己的发展。推行民族区域自治的工作现在还在继续进行，今年上半年将要建立广西僮族自治区和宁夏回族自治区，这是我国政治生活中的大事，也是我国民族政策的又一伟大胜利，尤其是在反民族主义的斗争中建立这两个自治区，更具有重要意义。
    在区域自治问题上，在整风开始的时候存在着这样的一种错误现象，就是不顾国家的统一领导，不顾现实条件和历史条件，无原则地要求扩大自治地方的面积，提高自治地方的行政地位。各民族自治地方都是祖国不可分离的一部分，都必须尊重国家的统一领导，任何把国家统一领导同自治权利对立起来的思想都是错误的。自治地方的区域和行政地位，必须根据民族人口、民族关系、经济发展等条件并参酌历史情况确定。在这方面无原则地要求“高”、“大”，必然要损害国家的统一和民族团结必须加以反对。　（未完待续）
