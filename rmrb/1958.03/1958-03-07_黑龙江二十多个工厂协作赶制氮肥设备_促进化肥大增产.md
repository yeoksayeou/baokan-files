    Heilongjiang Over Twenty Factories Cooperatively Rush to Manufacture Nitrogen Fertilizer Equipment
    Promoting a Large Increase in Fertilizer Production
    (Our Newspaper News) According to the Heilongjiang Daily: Over twenty factories in Heilongjiang are cooperatively producing three sets of nitrogen fertilizer equipment to supply the expansion needs of the Dalian, Jilin, and Lanzhou chemical factories. Each set of equipment can equip a factory with an annual output of 80,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer.
    The manufacture of a complete set of nitrogen fertilizer equipment is extremely complex, including high-pressure explosion-proof containers with 320 atmospheres, high-pressure explosion-proof compressors, and large motors, etc. The manufacture of this equipment is mainly undertaken by four factories, namely Harbin Boiler Factory, Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, Qiqihar Peace Machinery Factory, etc., and more than twenty enterprises, including Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and Fularji Heavy Machinery Factory, provide them with castings, forgings, or processed parts.
    In order to ensure the timely completion of the nitrogen fertilizer equipment production task, all factories have conscientiously strengthened technical leadership and launched a vigorous labor competition. The workers of the Harbin Boiler Factory, with a Great Leap Forward spirit, decided to increase this year's output of high-pressure and medium-pressure containers from the original plan of fifteen to twenty-two each.
    In the joint production of a complete set of nitrogen fertilizer equipment, all factories actively cooperate with each other. For example, in the organization of the cooperation of the nitrogen fertilizer equipment, they encountered the danger of failing to fulfill this year's production plan due to the lack of a seven-meter lathe and a five-meter vertical lathe. The Fularji Heavy Machinery Factory, which is under construction, has a seven-meter lathe, but it has not yet been installed, but they took the initiative to speed up the installation to serve the production of nitrogen fertilizer equipment; since there were no operators, the Peace Machinery Factory took the initiative to send fifteen to twenty workers to support the Heavy Machinery Factory.

    黑龙江二十多个工厂协作赶制氮肥设备
    促进化肥大增产
    本报讯  据黑龙江日报报道：黑龙江二十几个工厂正在协作生产三套氮肥设备，供应大连、吉林、兰州化学工厂扩建的需要。每套设备可装备一座年产八万吨氮肥的工厂。
    全套氮肥设备制造极为复杂，它包括有三百二十个大气压的防爆的高压容器、高压防爆压缩机和大型电机等。承制这些设备是以哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨电机厂、齐齐哈尔和平机械厂等四个工厂为主，并有齐齐哈尔第一机床厂、富拉尔基重型机器厂等二十多个企业为他们提供铸锻件或加工部件。
    为了保证按时完成氮肥设备的生产任务，各工厂都认真加强技术领导，开展了轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛。哈尔滨锅炉厂职工以跃进的精神，决定将今年生产的高压和中压容器的产量，各由原计划的十五台提高到二十二台。
    各工厂在共同生产全套氮肥设备中，都主动地相互协作。如在组织氮肥设备的协作中，曾碰到因缺少七公尺车床和五公尺的立车，使今年生产计划有落空的危险。正在紧张建设中的富拉尔基重型机器厂虽有七公尺车床，尚未安装，但他们主动提出加快安装速度为生产氮肥设备服务；没操作工人，和平机械厂又主动提出抽出十五到二十个工人支援重型机器厂。
