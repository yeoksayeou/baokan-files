Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: The China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce passed a joint circular to all local organizations at a joint meeting of the central standing committees of the two organizations on the 13th, requiring local organizations to promote the great leap forward movement of self-remolding by encouraging revolutionary vigor among industrialists and businessmen nationwide.

The circular said that a climax of self-remolding movement to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers within three or two years is rapidly forming among industrialists and businessmen across the country. This is a universal and profound socialist revolution in the politics and ideology of industrialists and businessmen, and it is a "movement to hand over their hearts" to the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country after the industrialists and businessmen handed over their means of production in 1956. The central committees of the two associations believe that the various demands for accelerating self-remolding put forward by industrialists and businessmen in the movement concentratedly and actively reflect their socialist enthusiasm. The local organizations of the two associations must seize this opportunity to universally and deeply carry out this movement.

The circular requires that in areas where the movement is developing, the organizations of the two associations should actively lead it according to the instructions of the local CCP committees. In places where the movement has already been launched, the movement should be guided to go deeper. Those who are carrying out general rectification should combine the general rectification with the current movement.

The joint meeting of the central standing committees of the two associations held on the 13th also decided that leaders of the two associations, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Nan Hanchen, Hu Ziang, Li Zhuchen, and others, will lead working groups to major regions across the country in the near future to conduct inspections in order to understand the situation of rectification and leap forward of local organizations, encourage vigor, and promote work.

    民主建国会　全国工商联
    通知各地抓紧时机开展自我改造运动
    新华社14日讯　中国民主建国会和全国工商业联合会13日在两会中央常务委员联席会议上，一致通过向各地方组织联合发出通函，要求各地组织推动全国工商业者鼓起革命干劲，进一步开展自我改造的大跃进运动。
    通函说，一个决心把自己在三年或两年内改变为自食其力的劳动者的自我改造运动的高潮，正在全国工商界中迅速形成。这是工商界在政治上、思想上进行社会主义革命的普遍和深入，是工商业者继1956年交出生产资料之后，向中国共产党、向全国人民的“交出心来的运动”。两会中央认为工商业者在运动中所提出的加速自我改造的种种要求，集中地、主动地反映了他们的社会主义积极性。两会地方组织必须抓紧这个时机，普遍而又深入地开展这个运动。
    通函要求运动正在发展的地区，两会组织要根据当地中共党委的指示，积极地加以领导。运动已经开展的地方，应当把运动引向深入。正在进行一般整风的，要使一般整风同当前的运动结合起来。
    13日举行的两会中央常委联席会议还决定两会领导人黄炎培、陈叔通、南汉宸、胡子昂、李烛尘等人在最近期内带领工作组分赴全国主要地区进行视察，以了解各地方组织的整风、跃进情况，鼓励干劲，推动工作。
