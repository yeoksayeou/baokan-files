    Urine and Feces Must Also Be Sold for Money!
    The members of the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Nanyuan Village, Xingtai City, haul urine fertilizer back from more than sixty agencies and organizations on Nanguan West Street in Xingtai City every day, and clean toilets for these units. These units do not pay cleaning fees; the Nanyuan Cooperative needs to spend more than 700 yuan a year to buy urine fertilizer from these units. Some people even want to get more money from it, such as Li Xirong at No. 187 West Street. The cooperative hauled his urine fertilizer for a year and a half, and he still complained that 44 yuan was too little, and went to the Nanyuan Cooperative to make a fuss three times and four times, insisting on 90 yuan.
    In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, many cadres and workers of agencies and organizations collect manure and accumulate fertilizer in their spare time to support agricultural production. However, these units mobilize their cadres and workers to collect manure and send it to agricultural cooperatives free of charge, while insisting that agricultural cooperatives pay for the urine fertilizer of their own units. These units should consider that if they sincerely support the great leap forward in agricultural production, they should no longer ask for money for urine fertilizer.

    尿粪也要卖钱吗！
    邢台市南园村红光农业社的社员们每天从邢台市南关西大街的六十多个机关、团体往回拉尿肥，并替这些单位清理厕所。这些单位不付出清洁费；南园社每年需要拿出七百多元去买这些单位的尿肥。甚至有的人还想从中多捞几个钱，如西大街一百八十七号的李修容，社里拉他一年半尿肥，给他四十四元他还嫌少，三番五次地到南园社大吵大闹，非要九十元不可。
    为了支持农业生产大跃进，许多机关、团体的广大职工在业余时间拾粪积肥来支援农业生产。可是这些单位一方面动员职工拾粪无偿地送给农业社，一方面本单位的尿肥却非叫农业社出钱来买不可。这些单位应该考虑一下，如果是真心支持农业生产大跃进，就不该再要尿肥钱。
