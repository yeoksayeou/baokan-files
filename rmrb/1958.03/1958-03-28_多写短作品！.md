    Write More Short Works!
    Jiangsu Donghai Bao, Dong Jinhuai

    Recently, we have seen the great leap forward plans of many writers and poets, and we are very happy. In these days of the national Great Leap Forward, every corner is seething with activity, and the situation is changing rapidly. In comparison, the things written by writers and poets are too few and too slow. In particular, those writers who went to the countryside and factories last year, living in the midst of the booming Great Leap Forward every day, should write more and write faster. But unfortunately, they have not written more. Is it because of insufficient enthusiasm, or are they only focused on brewing masterpieces and forgetting the present?

    We ask writers and poets to have both large creative plans and short works that reflect current life. At the same time, we hope that writers and poets will write more popular works that can be accepted by the broad masses. This point is particularly urgent in grassroots work. I would like to tell you a piece of news: Zhao Shuli's fast-clapper talk "‘Spring’ in the Changes of the Countryside" was published in the supplement of the People's Daily on February 18th, and it was immediately welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. Almost all of the eleven county newspapers we subscribe to reprinted this fast-clapper talk; by the end of February, the farmers were singing it. At that time, at the rural amateur art performance conferences held in various townships of Donghai County, this fast-clapper talk also became one of the most popular and excellent programs among farmers. From this, we can see how much the masses need and welcome the popular works of writers!

    I hope that writers will exert their enthusiasm, write more short works reflecting the Great Leap Forward, and write more popular and easy-to-understand works that can be accepted by the broad masses. It would be good if they could do what Comrade Zhao Shuli did.

    多写短作品！
    江苏东海报  董金淮
    近来我们看到不少作家和诗人们的跃进规划，非常高兴。在这全国人民大跃进的日子里，各个角落都在沸腾，形势变化一日千里，相形之下，作家们诗人们写的东西就太少太慢了。特别是那些去年已经下乡下厂的作家，终日都生活在轰轰烈烈的跃进中，更该多写一些，写得快一些。但是非常遗憾，他们还没有写出更多的东西来。是干劲不足吗，还是只顾酝酿巨著忘记了当前？
    我们要求作家和诗人们既有大的创作计划，更要有反映当前生活的短小作品。同时也希望作家和诗人多写一些通俗的能使广大群众接受的作品。这一点在基层工作中感到特别迫切。我愿告诉你们一个消息：赵树理同志的快板“‘春’在农村的变化”在2月18日人民日报副刊发表后，立刻受到广大农民的欢迎。在我们所订的十一份县报上，几乎都转载了这首快板；到了2月下旬，农民们就唱开了。当时我们东海县各乡举办的农村业余文艺会演大会上，这首快板也成为最受农民欢迎的优秀节目之一。由此可见群众是多么需要和欢迎作家们的通俗作品啊！
    希望作家发挥干劲，多写反映大跃进的短小作品，多写使广大群众接受的通俗易懂的作品。能像赵树理同志那样做法就好了。
