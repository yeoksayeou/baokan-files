Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 20th: According to TASS, Berlin: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, delivered a speech on the German 904 Free Radio Station on the 19th, condemning the West German government's policy of nuclear arms race.

Reimann said that the West German government is trying its best to win the support of the Federal Parliament on the issue of arming West Germany with atomic weapons, thereby undermining a summit meeting. This policy only conforms to the American foreign policy line implemented by US Secretary of State Dulles and the US General Staff.

Referring to West German Defense Minister Strauss's recent visit to the United States, Reimann emphasized that Strauss undertook an obligation in the United States: to resolve the issue of arming the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons and establishing atomic and rocket bases in West Germany before April 3.

Referring to the issue of a summit meeting between the East and West, Reimann expressed support for the Soviet government's proposals on the agenda. He pointed out that reaching international agreements on these topics would eliminate the threat of atomic war and the heavy burden of the arms race, while also creating an atmosphere of trust. In this case, the German question could be resolved as long as an agreement is reached between the two Germanies. Reimann emphasized that an agreement between the two Germanies on the establishment of a confederation is the only practical way to gradually restore German unification.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 20th: Bonn dispatch: Amidst an uproar, the West German Federal Parliament began a two-day debate on foreign policy. The central issues of this debate were: the issue of West German nuclear armament, West Germany's attitude towards a summit meeting, a nuclear-free zone, negotiations for a peace treaty, and West Germany's attitude towards the establishment of a confederation.

In an interpellation, the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group demanded that the West German government strive to discuss the principles of a German peace treaty at a high-level meeting. It also suggested that West Germany initiate talks aimed at establishing a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone like the one proposed by Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki. A motion put forward by the Social Democratic Party demanded that the government not equip its army with nuclear weapons, nor allow the storage of atomic rockets or the construction of launch sites in West Germany.

In a government statement, West German Chancellor Adenauer said that West Germany must equip its army with atomic weapons and allow the establishment of American rocket bases within its territory. If this were not done, the North Atlantic aggressive bloc would become "meaningless and pointless."

Adenauer's speech was full of anti-Soviet and anti-communist fallacies. He called the Soviet Union a "potential enemy" and demanded the continued implementation of a "policy of strength" towards the Soviet Union. Adenauer also repeated his old tune against the establishment of a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone.

A speech by West German Foreign Minister Brentano showed that the Bonn government was prepared to continue obstructing the convocation of an East-West summit meeting by demanding that the issue of German unification be included on the agenda.

The chairman of the Free Democratic Party parliamentary group, Mende, launched a fierce criticism of the Adenauer government's foreign policy. In his speech, he supported the Soviet Union's proposal to discuss a German peace treaty at the summit meeting. He accused Adenauer of obstructing the holding of a summit meeting and fabricating lies on the issue of negotiating a treaty. Social Democratic Party parliamentarian Ant disclosed that the Adenauer government's true intention was to create a fait accompli of equipping the West German army with atomic weapons before the summit meeting was held.

Strauss, the Minister of Defense, a fanatical atomic war planner who had just returned from purchasing missiles in the United States, flew into a rage on the podium, clamoring anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments, openly defending Hitler's heinous crimes, and loudly berating the opposition parties for not opposing the Bonn government's nuclear armament policy. The vice chairman of the Social Democratic Party parliamentary group, Erler, said that Strauss's speech reminded him of the scene when Goebbels coerced parliamentarians to accept the concept of "total war" in the parliament. At this time, a frenzy of roars and curses erupted from the government party seats, and Adenauer's party members shouted and withdrew from the parliament hall.

    德共第一书记和西德反对党议员
    指斥西德政府进行核武装
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社柏林讯：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼19日在德国九○四自由广播电台发表演说，谴责西德政府的核军备竞赛政策。
    雷曼说，西德政府竭力要在用原子武器武装西德的问题上争取到联邦议院的支持，从而破坏最高级会议。这种政策只符合美国国务卿杜勒斯和美国参谋部实行的美国外交政策路线。
    雷曼谈到西德国防部长施特劳斯最近的美国之行时强调指出，施特劳斯在美国承担了一项义务：在4月3日以前解决用原子武器武装西德国防军以及在西德建立原子基地和火箭基地的问题。
    雷曼谈到东西方最高级会议问题时，表示支持苏联政府关于议程问题的建议。他指出，就这些议题达成国际协议，就可以解除原子战争的威胁和军备竞赛带来的沉重负担，同时还可以创造信任的气氛。在这种情况下，只要两个德国之间达成协议，就可以使德国问题获得解决。雷曼着重指出，两个德国就建立邦联问题达成协议，是逐步恢复德国统一的唯一切实可行的道路。
    据新华社柏林20日电　波恩消息：西德联邦议院在一片哄乱中开始举行了为时两天的外交政策辩论。这次辩论的中心问题是：西德进行原子武装问题、西德对最高级会议的态度问题、对无子原武器区、谈判缔结和约以及西德对成立邦联的态度等问题。
    自由民主党议会党团在质询中要求西德政府争取在高级会议上讨论对德和约的原则。它还建议西德发起旨在建立像波兰外长腊帕茨基提议的那种中欧无原子武器地区的会谈。社会民主党提出的议案要求政府不要用核武器装备它的军队，也不要允许在西德存放原子火箭和建筑发射基地。
    西德总理阿登纳在政府声明中说，西德必须用原子武器装备它的军队和准许在它的境内设立美国火箭基地。如果不这样做，北大西洋侵略集团就会变得“毫无意义和目的”。
    阿登纳的演讲充满了反苏反共的谰言。他把苏联称为“潜在的敌人”，并且要求对苏联继续执行“实力政策”。阿登纳还重弹他的反对建立中欧无原子武器区的老调。
    西德外交部长勃伦塔诺的发言表明了，波恩政府准备继续用要求把德国统一问题列入议程的方法来阻挠召开东西方最高级会议。
    自由民主党议会党团主席蒙德对阿登纳政府的外交政策进行了猛烈的批评。他在发言中支持苏联所提出的在最高级会议上讨论对德和约的建议，他指责阿登纳阻挠举行最高级会议，并且在谈判和约问题上制造谎言。社会民主党议员安特揭露阿登纳政府的真正意图是打算在最高级会议举行前造成用原子武器装备西德军队的既成事实。
    刚从美国购买导弹归来的狂热的原子战争策划者、国防部长施特劳斯在讲台上暴跳如雷，大肆叫嚣反苏反共，公开替希特勒的滔天罪行辩护，并且高声责骂反对党不该反对波恩政府的原子武装政策。社会民主党议会党团副主席埃勒说，施特劳斯的发言使他想起了当年戈培尔在议会上威迫议员们接受“总体战”概念的情景。这时，政府党议席上响起一片狂吼和怒骂，阿登纳党的议员纷纷喊叫，并且退出了议会大厅。
