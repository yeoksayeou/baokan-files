Notebook

    The commander of the U.S. invading forces in Korea, Decker, recently took a trip to Taiwan. Before returning to Seoul, he answered reporters regarding the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, saying that China's withdrawal statement "only says they will retreat behind the Yalu River." This is exactly the same as what Assistant Secretary of State Robertson said a few days ago. It seems that the American aggressors can no longer find other words to diminish the significance of the Chinese People's Volunteers' peaceful action of withdrawing from Korea.
    Behind the Yalu River is the vast Chinese territory of over 9.6 million square kilometers. Where the Chinese People's Volunteers return is none of America's business. What is related to America is: when will the American troops withdraw from Korea? In the face of this moral pressure from world opinion, how can using "Yalu River" to perfunctorily answer questions cover the eyes and ears of the world?

    词穷
    美国侵朝军队司令德克尔最近到台湾跑了一趟。他在回汉城以前，就中国人民志愿军的撤出朝鲜，回答记者说：中国的撤军声明“只是说他们将退到鸭绿江后面”。这同前两天美国助理国务卿罗伯逊的谈话，简直一模一样。看来，美国侵略者对于中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的和平行动，是再也找不出其他的话来减低它的意义了。
    鸭绿江后面，是九百多万平方公里的广阔的中国土地，中国人民志愿军回到哪里去，与美国无干。而同美国有关系的是：美国军队何时撤出朝鲜？在世界舆论的这种道义压力面前，光用“鸭绿江”来搪塞，岂能掩尽天下耳目？
