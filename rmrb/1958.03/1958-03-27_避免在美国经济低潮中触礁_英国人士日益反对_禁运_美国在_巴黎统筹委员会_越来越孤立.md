Xinhua News Agency, March 26th, Paris: Trade experts from various countries in the Paris "Coordinating Committee," established to restrict Western countries' trade with socialist bloc countries, are currently meeting. According to Western news agencies and newspapers, under the enormous shadow of the rapidly declining American economy, the disputes between the American delegation and the delegations of Japan and Western European countries over the issue of restricting East-West trade are more intense than ever before. These countries are demanding a relaxation of trade restrictions, and their pressure on the United States is increasing.

It is reported that the delegations of various countries participating in the meeting have already put forward about a hundred suggestions. The meeting will end this week, allowing governments to study these suggestions. Then, the delegations will reconvene at the end of April with further instructions from their respective governments.

Observers here point out that in Western countries, especially in Britain, political, industrial, and trade union figures generally believe that the so-called "strategic materials restrictions" on East-West trade should be relaxed now, and that every effort should be made to find new markets to offset the disastrous effects of the economic recession.

The "Daily Express," a newspaper of the British Conservative imperialists, said in an editorial on the 25th: The so-called "strategic materials embargo list" has created "an absurd situation," "The ban on the export of so-called strategic materials to China no longer makes sense. The time has come to adapt British trade policy to reality."

Yesterday's editorial in the "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of British big capitalists, also said that it would be "foolish" to easily give up the socialist world market without fully studying the possibility of increasing British exports, "especially during a (capitalist) world (economic) recession."

The "Financial Times" industrial commentator pointed out in an article entitled "British Industrialists Hope for General Relaxation of Trade Restrictions" that British industrialists believe that restrictions on strategic materials supplied to Eastern countries must be relaxed to a much greater extent than the British government plans. Only then can trade between East and West truly be expanded.

    避免在美国经济低潮中触礁
    英国人士日益反对“禁运”
    美国在“巴黎统筹委员会”越来越孤立
    据新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：为限制西方国家对社会主义阵营国家的贸易而建立的巴黎“统筹委员会”里的各国贸易专家，目前正在开会。据西方通讯社和报纸透露，在美国经济急遽衰退的巨大阴影笼罩下，会上美国代表团同日本和西欧国家的代表团在限制东西方贸易问题上的争执，比过去任何时候都更加剧烈。这些国家要求放宽贸易限制，它们对美国的压力越来越大。
    据报道，参加会议的各国代表团已经提出了大约有一百个建议。会议将在本星期结束，好让各国政府研究这些建议。然后，各国代表团再带着本国政府的进一步指示在4月底重新开会。
    此间观察家指出，目前在西方国家，尤其是在英国，政界、工业界和工会人士普遍认为，现在就应该放松对东西方贸易的所谓“战略物资限制”，而且应该尽力去寻找新的市场，以便抵消经济衰退的灾难性影响。
    英国保守党帝国派人士的报纸“每日快报”25日的社论说：所谓“战略物资禁运单”已经造成“一种荒诞的局面”，“关于对中国出口所谓战略物资的禁令，已经不再有意义了。使英国贸易政策适应现实的时候已经来到。”
    英国大资本家的喉舌“金融时报”昨天的社论也说，没有充分研究过增加英国输出的可能就轻易地放弃社会主义世界市场，是“愚蠢”的，“特别是在（资本主义）世界（经济）衰退的时候”是这样。
    “金融时报”工业评论员在题为“英国工业家希望普遍放松贸易限制”的文章中指出，英国工业家们认为，必须在比英国政府计划要大得多的程度上放松对输给东方国家战略物资的限制。只有那时才能真正扩大东西方之间的贸易。
