The people of China and the United States both hope that journalists from the two countries can visit each other soon to promote mutual understanding between the two peoples. However, this reasonable wish has not been realized due to American obstruction.

On March 17th, the U.S. State Department extended the passports, which had been issued to American journalists to visit our country six months ago and had already expired, for another seven months. At the same time, according to a United Press International report, U.S. State Department officials took this opportunity to make a statement, saying that the "invitation" for Chinese journalists to apply for U.S. visas was still valid, but "the fact that the Chinese have not responded to these invitations proves that they are still unwilling to allow American journalists to conduct interviews in their country, and only they know the reason." After hearing this, it seems that the responsibility for the failure of Chinese and American journalists to visit each other lies with the Chinese side.

However, gentlemen of the U.S. State Department: pretending to be confused will not absolve you of responsibility! Don't the gentlemen of the U.S. State Department know best why American journalists still cannot enter China today?

Since August 1956, hasn't our country successively approved a number of applications from American journalists to visit China? At that time, wasn't it the U.S. government that issued a strict ban in order to block the truth about the new China from the American people? After encountering strong opposition from domestic and foreign public opinion, it dragged on until around August 1957, when the United States announced the so-called "issuance of passports to a limited number of journalists to visit China on an experimental basis." However, not only did the State Department publicly claim that these journalists were to come to China to collect intelligence, but it also impolitely proposed that "agreement to allow American journalists to visit China is premised on China not making reciprocal requests." When our country, in order to promote the desire of the two peoples to enhance mutual understanding, proposed "a draft agreement on allowing journalists from both sides to conduct news interviews in each other's countries on the basis of equality and reciprocity" at the 70th Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Meeting in Geneva on September 12, 1957, it was immediately rejected by the U.S. side. With this, wasn't the U.S. government's true colors completely exposed? That's how things have dragged on until now.

The American people and the American press urgently demand that their own journalists visit China, and this feeling is completely understandable. However, the U.S. government continues to stubbornly obstruct the exchange of journalists between the two countries. We do not know, if the U.S. government does not change its arrogant attitude and resolve the issue of mutual visits by journalists from the two countries in accordance with international practice and on the principle of equality and reciprocity, then what is the significance of the U.S. government repeatedly extending the validity of passports issued to American journalists? How can the empty talk of "welcoming Chinese journalists" to visit the United States break the deadlock it has created? The current practices of the U.S. government are, in fact, nothing more than a smokescreen played to cope with the pressure of domestic public opinion, which can only deceive itself and not others.

### 原因在于美国的阻挠

    原因在于美国的阻挠
    中美两国人民，都指望两国记者早日来往，以促进两国人民的互相了解。可是这一合理的愿望，由于美国的阻挠，迄今未能实现。
    3月17日，美国国务院把半年以前发给美国记者访问我国已经到期的护照，延长了七个月。同时，据美国国际新闻社的消息，美国国务院官员借此机会，又做了一段文章，说什么关于我国记者申请访美签证的
  “邀请”仍然有效，可是“中国人对这些邀请不作答复一点证明他们还不愿意让美国记者到他们国家进行采访，其原因只有他们自己最清楚”。听了这一番话，似乎中美记者之所以不能来往，责任倒在中国方面了。
    不过，美国国务院的先生们：装糊涂是推卸不了责任的！美国记者直到今天还不能进入中国的原因，难道美国国务院的先生们不也是最清楚的吗？
    自从1956年8月以后，我国不是曾经陆续批准了一批美国记者要求到中国访问的申请吗？当时，不正是美国政府为了对美国人民封锁关于新中国的真情，下了严厉的禁令吗？在遭到国内外舆论的强烈反对之后，拖到1957年8月间，美国宣布了所谓“在试验的基础上，发给数目有限的记者”来中国访问的护照。可是，不仅国务院公开声称是要这批记者到中国来搜集情报的，并且还无礼地提出“同意美国记者来华是以中国不提出互惠要求为前提的”。当我国为了促进两国人民要求增进相互了解的愿望，在1957年9月12日，在日内瓦举行的第七十次中美大使级会议上提出“在平等互惠的基础上，准许对方新闻记者前来各自的国家进行新闻采访的协议草案”之后，竟立即遭到美方的拒绝。这一来，美国政府的底，不就完全揭穿了吗？事情就是这样拖到了现在。
    美国人民和美国新闻界，迫切要求有自己的记者到中国来访问，这一种心情，是完全可以理解的。可是，美国政府却继续顽固地阻挠两国记者的往来。我们不知道，如果美国政府不改变那种蛮横的态度，遵照国际惯例，以平等互惠的原则来解决两国记者互相访问的问题，那末，美国政府所发给美国记者的护照，即使一再延长期限，又有什么意义呢？所谓“欢迎中国记者”访美的空话，怎么能打开它自己所造成的僵局呢？目前美国政府的这些做法，实际上，不过是为了应付国内舆论的压力而玩弄的障眼法，是只能自欺而不能欺人的。
