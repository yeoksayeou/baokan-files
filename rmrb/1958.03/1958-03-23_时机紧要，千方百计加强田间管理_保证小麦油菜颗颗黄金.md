This newspaper reports from Hefei: Anhui Province's nearly 60 million mu of wheat and rapeseed are growing very well, the wheat is green and strong, and the rapeseed has bolted and is flowering.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops, various parts of Anhui have strengthened the field management of wheat and rapeseed. The wheat and rapeseed fields throughout the province have been top-dressed once, and more than 60% have been top-dressed two to three times. Wheat and rapeseed in the Huainan and along-the-Yangtze River areas have generally been weeded one to three times. Huaibei, a major wheat-producing area, is also changing its past habits of not applying urine fertilizer, spring irrigation, or weeding to wheat. More than 18 million mu of wheat in Huaibei have been top-dressed for the second and third time, mostly with human and animal manure and some chemical fertilizers, and more than 10 million mu of wheat fields have been weeded and spring-irrigated.

Various localities have also strengthened the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, ensuring that any diseases and insect pests are eliminated on the spot as soon as they are discovered. Fuyang Prefecture discovered wheat spider in 30,000 mu of wheat fields and has eliminated it in more than 20,000 mu of wheat fields. Some wheat fields in Shouxian County, Lu'an Prefecture, have been infested with wireworms, and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately dispatched a large number of sprayers and medicines. In order to prevent wheat rust, relevant departments have prepared a large number of medicines such as sulfur and lime.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd: Jiangxi Province's more than 4 million mu of rapeseed is growing vigorously and flowering luxuriantly, making it the best year for growth since liberation. According to the person in charge of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the total output of rapeseed in the province this year may reach 200 million to 240 million jin, an increase of 140% compared with last year.

The main reasons for the good growth of rapeseed this year are the importance attached to it by the leadership, the tight grasp, and the conscientious implementation of the policy of assigning and purchasing oil crops. Secondly, agricultural cooperatives in various localities have implemented "three guarantees" for rapeseed fields, changing the previous situation where rapeseed was not guaranteed output, strengthening the responsibility of commune members for cultivating rapeseed, and generally doing a good job in thinning, fertilizing, and weeding rapeseed fields. More than 4 million mu of rapeseed fields throughout the province have been fertilized twice and weeded twice.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of rapeseed, agricultural cooperatives in various localities are currently top-dressing rapeseed fields with quick-acting fertilizers such as human manure and ammonium sulfate to promote the later growth and development of rapeseed. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives are also clearing ditches and draining water in the fields to prevent waterlogging in the fields caused by the arrival of the plum rain season, which hinders the growth of rapeseed.

    时机紧要，千方百计加强田间管理
    保证小麦油菜颗颗黄金
    本报合肥讯　安徽省近六千万亩麦子油菜生长很好，麦子油绿壮实，油菜已抽苔开花。
    安徽各地为争取午季作物大丰收，都加强对麦子油菜的田间管理工作。全省的麦子油菜田里已追肥一次，60％以上追过两次到三次肥。淮南和沿江地区的麦子油菜普遍锄草一至三次。盛产小麦的淮北地区也在改变过去小麦不追尿肥，不春灌、锄草的习惯。全淮北追第二、三次肥的小麦有一千八百多万亩，大都用的人畜粪尿肥和部分化肥，进行锄草和春灌的小麦田共有一千多万亩。
    各地也加强了防止病虫害的工作，做到那里发现病虫害即刻就地消灭。阜阳专区发现三万亩小麦田里有麦蜘蛛，已在两万多亩麦田上加以消灭。六安专区寿县的部分麦田里出现了金针虫，省供销社即刻调去了大批的喷雾器和药剂。为了防止小麦锈病，有关部门已准备了大量的硫磺、石灰等药剂。
    本报特约新华社南昌22日电　江西省四百多万亩油菜生长茁壮，开花茂盛，是解放后生长最好的一年。据省农业厅负责人谈，今年全省油菜总产量可达到二亿到二亿四千万斤，将比去年增产140％。
    今年油菜生长良好的原因，主要是领导重视，抓得紧，和认真贯彻了油料的派种派购的政策。其次，各地农业社对油菜田实行了“三包”，改变了往年油菜不包产的情况，加强了社员培育油菜的责任心，一般都做好了油菜田的间苗、施肥和锄草等工作。全省四百余万亩油菜田，大都施了两次肥，锄了两遍草。
    为了争取油菜大丰收，目前各地农业社正在油菜田里追施人粪尿和硫酸铵等速效性肥料，以促进油菜后期的生长和发育。同时，各农业社还在田里清沟排水，以防黄梅多雨季节到来引起田内渍水，妨碍油菜生长。
