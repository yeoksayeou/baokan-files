Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th: This year's Soviet industrial production indicators show that its industrial strength will be further enhanced in one year. The oil it produces this year is enough to launch seven hundred thousand rocket spaceships, each weighing one hundred tons, into the high altitudes of the universe. If all the steel produced this year were rolled into steel rails, it would be enough to lay a double-track railway as long as the distance from the Earth to the Moon. The electricity increased this year alone could smelt 53.7 million tons of iron or manufacture 4.3 million tractors.

In terms of light industrial production, the total length of textiles produced by the Soviet Union this year is equal to the entire distance traveled by the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite in eleven days and nights. If the shoes produced this year were lined up one after another, they could circle the Earth five times along the equator.

The Soviet Union will begin construction and completion of a large number of new factories, mines, and power stations this year. In Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, and Pavlodar, Kazakhstan, construction of large-scale oil refineries will begin. The four large oil refineries under construction in Gorky, Stalingrad, Perm, and Fergana will be completed this year. In terms of the iron and steel industry, seven giant blast furnaces, several large steel rolling mills, and a new iron mine with an annual output of ten million tons of iron ore will be completed this year. In terms of the electric power industry, the Soviet Union will build new power stations with a total power generation capacity of 5 million kilowatts this year, the world's largest Stalingrad Hydropower Station will begin generating electricity, and the Irkutsk Hydropower Station in Siberia will be fully completed.

In terms of consumer goods industry, the Soviet Union will begin construction of some textile factories with a total of 224,000 spindles and 8,000 looms, and will complete eleven meat processing plants, twelve sugar factories, and forty-five dairy product and oil factories.

With the commissioning of new production capacity and the increase in the productivity of existing enterprises, the Soviet Union's oil extraction will increase to 112 million tons this year, coal mining will exceed 488.8 million tons, pig iron production will increase to 39.1 million tons, steel will increase to 53.6 million tons, and electricity production will reach 231 billion kilowatt-hours. In addition, the textiles, footwear, meat, and dairy products industries will also increase the production of consumer goods for residents.

    苏联工业今年将更大步跃进
    石油产量能把七十万只火箭飞船发射到太空
    生产的钢如果筑成双轨铁路可以铺筑到月球
    增产的电力可以制造出四百三十万台拖拉机
    生产纺织品总长等于人造卫星十一昼夜行程
    生产的皮鞋连到一起可以顺赤道绕地球五圈
    新华社莫斯科13日电  今年苏联工业生产指标表明，它的工业力量在一年中将进一步增强。今年它所生产的石油足以把七十万只每只重一百吨的火箭飞船发射到宇宙高空。如果把今年生产的钢都轧成钢轨，足够铺筑从地球到月亮那么长的双轨铁路。单是用今年增产的电力就可以炼五千三百七十万吨铁或者制造出四百三十万台拖拉机。
    在轻工业生产方面，今年苏联生产的纺织品的总长度等于苏联第二颗人造卫星飞行十一昼夜所经过的全部行程。如果把今年生产的皮鞋一个接一个地排列起来，可以顺赤道绕地球五圈。
    苏联今年将开始建设和建成大批新工厂、矿山和发电站。在西伯利亚的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克和哈萨克的巴夫洛达，将开始建设规模很大的炼油厂。正在高尔基、斯大林格勒、白尔姆和弗尔干纳建设的四个大炼油厂，将在今年落成。在钢铁工业方面，今年将建成七座巨型高炉、几座大轧钢工厂和年产一千万吨铁矿砂的新铁矿。在电力工业方面，苏联今年将新建总发电能力达五百万瓩的发电站，世界最大的斯大林格勒水电站将开始发电，西伯利亚的伊尔库次克水电站将全部建成。
    在消费品工业方面，苏联将开始建设一些总共有二十二万四千支纺锭和八千台织布机的纺织工厂，将建成十一个肉类联合工厂，十二个制糖厂、四十五个奶制品工厂和油脂工厂。
    随着新生产能力的投入生产和现有企业生产力的提高，今年苏联的石油开采量将增加到一亿一千二百万吨，采煤量将超过四亿八千八百万吨，生铁产量将增加到三千九百一十万吨，钢增加到五千三百六十万吨，电力产量达到二千三百一十亿度。此外，纺织、制鞋、肉类和奶制品工业为居民生产的消费品也将增加许多。
