Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 6th: The broad masses of workers and staff in Nanjing's factories and mines are now surging forward with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm to break conventions in the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement. In just a few days, the number of big-character posters in various factories and mines has far exceeded the total number of big-character posters put up since the rectification campaign.

In this struggle, the leaders of many factories and mines are acting as both commanders and combatants. The workers have put forward the fighting slogan "We will never stop until waste is eliminated and conservatism is smashed." Many young workers have formed youth fighting teams to fiercely attack waste and conservatism. Engineering and technical personnel are also not to be outdone, actively participating in the double-anti struggle.

The anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement has already shown the power to promote a great leap forward in production. The number of shunting locomotives at Pukou Railway Station has been reduced from five to four, and the workers have proposed reducing it by one more. On March 1st, experiments proved that three locomotives could fully undertake the tasks of five locomotives.

    南京广大职工奋战口号
    不扫尽浪费保守决不罢休
    据新华社南京6日电　南京市厂矿企业广大职工，在反浪费反保守运动中，正以奔腾的革命热情，突破常规向前跃进。几天之内，各厂矿企业的大字报已远远超过整风以来所贴的大字报总和。
    在这场斗争中，许多厂矿企业的领导人既作指挥员又作战斗员。职工们提出了“不把浪费扫尽，不把保守攻破，决不罢休”的战斗口号。许多青年职工组成青年战斗队，向浪费、保守猛攻。工程技术人员也不甘示弱，积极参加双反斗争。
    反浪费反保守运动一开始就已显示出推动生产工作大跃进的威力。浦口车站调车机车已由五台减为四台，工人们又提出再减少一台。3月1日，经过试验，已经证明三台机车完全可以负担五台机车的任务。
