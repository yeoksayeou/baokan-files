    "Eager to Go to China"
    -- Gorky's Letter to Chekhov
    In May 1900, the anti-imperialist struggle of the Boxer Rebellion began, followed by the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance. On July 9th (July 22nd according to the new calendar) of that year, Gorky wrote a letter to Chekhov and made the following suggestion:
    "Dear Anton Pavlovich!
    "Shall we go to China together? Once, in Yalta, you said you wanted to go very much. Let's go together! I really want to go there, and I intend to recommend myself to a certain newspaper to work as a correspondent. My wife is reluctant to let me go alone, but she says that if you can go too, she can be completely assured about me. Go, dear Anton Pavlovich! It's very interesting there, but it's monotonous and tasteless here."
    In another letter to Chekhov in the same month, Gorky wrote:
    "The idea of China is tormenting me. I really want to go to China! I haven't longed for anything so strongly for a long time. Don't you also want to travel to distant places - let's go together? Really going? That would be great!..."
    At the end of this letter, Gorky emphasized again: "Please reply about the matter of going to China." Chekhov replied to Gorky in a letter on July 12th (July 25th according to the new calendar):
    "Dear Alexei Maximovich!
    "Your invitation to travel to China surprised me greatly. What about the play? What about the play ("The Petty Bourgeois" - translator)? You've probably finished writing it, haven't you? In any case, it's too late to go to China, and it seems that the war is about to end. If I go there, I can only be a doctor. A military doctor. If the war continues, I will go, but now I will sit down and write something a little."
    Perhaps after that, Gorky was busy writing, or for some other reason, his plan to come to China was not realized. However, from the letter he wrote to his and Chekhov's mutual good friend, the doctor Srekin, between August 26th and 30th (between September 8th and 12th) of that year, it can be seen that he attached great importance to this anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese people:
    "...If a real war is declared - then I will go. I will definitely go! I think this war has great significance. If it lasts for thirty years and turns into a great European war, I won't be surprised at all! Alas, why am I not a Chinese! I want to show you what civilization is! I want to strip the mask of culture from you! I want to..."

    “非常想到中国去”
    ——高尔基写给契呵夫的信
    1900年5月，义和团的反帝斗争开始，接着是八国联军的入侵，就在这年的7月9日（新历是22日）高尔基写信给契呵夫，并向他提出了这样的建议：
    “亲爱的安东·巴甫洛维奇！
    “同到中国去吗？有一次，在雅尔达，您说您很想去。一同去吧！我非常想到那儿去，并且我打算向某家报纸自荐担任通讯记者的工作。我的妻子不大愿意放我一个人去，但是说，假如您也能去，那她对我就可以完全放心了。去吧，亲爱的安东·巴甫洛维奇！那儿很有趣，可是这儿却单调无味。”
    在同月给契呵夫的另一封信中，高尔基又写道：
    “中国的念头在折磨着我。非常想到中国去！很久以来，我从没有像这样强烈地想望过什么事。你不是也想到远地去旅行——一同去吗？真去吗？那就好极了！……”
    在这封信结尾的地方，高尔基又着重加上了一句：“去中国的事，请回复”。契呵夫在7月12日（新历25日）就复了高尔基一封信：
    “亲爱的阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇！
    “您邀我到中国去旅行，使我大吃一惊。那个剧本呢？那个剧本怎么样（指剧本“小市民”——译者）大概您已把它写完了吧？无论怎样，到中国去是太迟了，看起来，战争已快结束。要是到那儿去，我只能当一个医生。当一个军医。假如战争延长下去的话，那我就去，可是现在还是坐下来，稍微写一些东西”。
    也许在这之后，高尔基为了写作忙，或是其他什么原因未曾实现到中国来的计划，但从他在当年8月26日与30日之间（9月8日与12日之间）写给他和契呵夫的共同的好朋友——医生斯烈金的信中可以看出，他是非常重视中国人民的这次反帝斗争的：
    “……要是真正宣战——那我就去。一定去！我认为这次战争具有巨大的意义。假如要延长到三十年，变成为全欧洲的大混战，那我一点也不会吃惊！唉，为什么我不是一个中国人！我要让你们看看什么是文明！我要从你们身上剥下文化的假面具！我要……”
