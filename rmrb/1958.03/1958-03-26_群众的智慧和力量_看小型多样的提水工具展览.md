The Wisdom and Strength of the Masses
——Viewing an Exhibition of Small and Diverse Water Lifting Tools
By Our Correspondent Deng Zichang

A few days ago, the Cangxian Special District of Hebei Province held an exhibition of simple water lifting tools manufactured and modified by the masses. Some of the exhibits were made by the agricultural cooperatives of the Cangxian Special District themselves, and some were produced by local industrial and handicraft departments.

Here, people could see more than 130 various water lifting tools newly installed on a canal more than four miles long and several wells. Most were hand-operated or foot-pedaled, and a few were powered by animal power, wind power, or water power. Some were suitable for use on wells, some for canals, pits, ponds, and reservoirs, and some could be used for both wells and canals. Their most notable feature was that most of the parts were made of wood or bamboo, or they were made by modifying and combining discarded old looms, broken waterwheels, broken car wheels, and by borrowing cotton gins, chaff cutters, large and small cartwheels, and wind bows (used for cotton batting). Visitors generally believed that the common advantages of these water lifting tools were: materials were easy to find, they were easy to manufacture, they were lightweight to use, and they saved money and iron, so every cooperative could make them.

Before people even entered the venue, they could see from afar a large wooden canvas windmill that looked like a large "carousel lantern." It was seven meters high and six meters in diameter, with a central pillar in the middle and eight wooden pillars and eight canvas sails on all sides. It was the largest exhibit at the venue. When the reporter visited, it happened to be a windy day. The windmill automatically rotated rapidly, driving two dragon bone waterwheels through wooden horizontal shafts and gears in a water lifting performance, making the water in the canal gush to where people wanted it to go. The guide explained: This windmill was improved by imitating the windmills used in the Hangu Salt Field. Areas with strong winds could use it as power. A level 3 wind could drive one waterwheel, and a level 3 or higher wind could drive two waterwheels. It could irrigate about 40 to 100 mu of land day and night. Its power was equivalent to a 3.5 to 7.5 horsepower locomotive boiler, but the cost was at least 1,000 to 3,000 yuan lower than that of a locomotive boiler.

The venue was bustling with people. Many people, upon arriving at the loom-style large cartwheel foot-pedal double wooden pipe waterwheel and the loom-style large cartwheel foot-pedal double iron pipe waterwheel placed together with the same style, couldn't help but stop to take a closer look, busy inquiring about the modification process, usage conditions, and value. Some people couldn't resist sitting on them themselves, pedaling the wooden boards with their feet to lift the water from low to high, praising repeatedly: It's so effortless, it's really a good thing! Both of these waterwheels used the frames of discarded looms, borrowed large iron cartwheels, and only added an iron axle with two bends and water pipes, chains, and other accessories. The only difference between the two was in the material of the water pipes and chains: one was made of wood, and the pipes were square; the other was made of iron, and the pipes were round. People compared and discussed them, and some expressed the following opinions: Wooden water pipes and chains will swell after soaking in water, and pedaling them is slightly more laborious than with iron ones; the water output of the two is about the same, irrigating about 9 to 12 mu of land per day; and the wooden one costs only more than 10 yuan per set (including buying bent iron axles, same below); the iron one costs more than 20 yuan per set. The wooden one can be 10 yuan cheaper and also saves iron casting materials, so promoting this type of waterwheel with wooden water pipes is of more universal significance.

The exhibition of many simple water lifting tools that were modified and combined from discarded and useless looms, as well as old cotton gins and wind bows and other cotton processing machinery, aroused great interest among visitors from the main cotton producing areas of Hebei—Handan and Shijiazhuang Special Districts. They happily said: We have plenty of these things in our place. If they are broken, we simply use them as waterwheels; the good ones can be used as waterwheels and still be used for cotton processing in the winter. If we do this, we will be able to solve the problem of water lifting tools quickly, well, and economically. This is truly a simple and easy, mutually beneficial idea.

The most impressive exhibit was a pure wooden double-person hand-cranked waterwheel made by Sun Yushan, a farmer from Wuqiang County. This well-canal dual-purpose, easy-to-move waterwheel not only used no iron parts at all, but also used all old wood, and the wooden frame even had countless wormholes. The guide said: If new wood is bought to make it, the cost would be no more than 10 yuan and 5 jiao. Because this waterwheel used all old wood, only some iron wire and leather money were bought during installation, costing less than one yuan! After hearing such an explanation, how could people not think: If everyone was so careful and thrifty, and turned all the usable waste materials into waterwheels, how much capital would the agricultural cooperatives save!

Visitors were not only watching each exhibit very carefully, but they were even more fascinated when the guides (most of whom were the manufacturers of the exhibits) talked about the manufacturing process. It turned out that the manufacturers of these exhibits were carpenters and blacksmiths, farmers and cadres, and also female students and tailors who had returned to their hometowns to participate in production. These deeds once again showed that as long as we rely on the masses and give full play to their wisdom and strength, the situation of insufficient supply of water lifting tools can be greatly changed, the water conservancy projects that cannot flow naturally can have the conditions to play a role in irrigating the land, and the great leap forward in agricultural production will be even more guaranteed.

Here was exhibited a wooden and bamboo hand-cranked waterwheel. Its manufacturer was named Meng Xiangyi. He was originally a tailor. He returned to his hometown of Mengjia Matou Village, Jiaohe County, in 1954, and later joined the agricultural cooperative as a member. During the hot summer of last year, he went to the fields with the cooperative members every day to draw water to irrigate the crops. He saw that although the entire cooperative had more than 130 wells, there were only 20 waterwheels. He watched as the water in each well was full, but there was no way to let those thirsty seedlings drink their fill, which made him very anxious. From then on, Meng Xiangyi was thinking about one question every moment: how to imitate the shape of a dragon bone waterwheel to manufacture a simple wooden waterwheel for use on wells. Although his idea was once suspected and opposed by some cooperative cadres with conservative ideas, it was supported and encouraged by the village Party branch secretary and the township cadres. The Party branch secretary also found wood for him as materials, and assigned a carpenter to specifically assist him in trial production. In this way, in the twenty-odd days at the end of last year, after the last improvement, this waterwheel was finally made.

Each of these waterwheels costs about 20 yuan, and half-laborers can use them. They can irrigate four or five mu of land a day. Compared with the Liberation-type waterwheel, it is 50 to 60 yuan cheaper, irrigates one or two more mu of land a day, and saves 95 kilograms of iron materials. Now, the members of this cooperative praised Meng Xiangyi endlessly, and their enthusiasm for production has also increased. They are rushing to build this waterwheel, striving to achieve that every well has a waterwheel soon.

Visitors not only looked at the exhibits, but also paid great attention to learning from other people's advanced ideas and advanced experience, from which they gained useful inspiration.

At the venue, there were crowds of people surrounding the guides everywhere. They pointed, asked, and were busy taking notes, drawing pictures, and practicing operations. The director of a woodworking cooperative drew more than 60 drawings at one time and recorded the dimensions in detail. He said that this visit had liberated his thinking and learned methods. Once he returned, he would combine them with the specific situation of the local area and carry out a large number of imitations and promotions.

    群众的智慧和力量
    ——看小型多样的提水工具展览
    本报记者　邓子常
    前几天，河北省沧县专区举办了一个群众制造和改造的简易提水工具展览会。展出的展品，一部分是沧县专区农业社自己制造的，一部分是当地工业和手工业部门生产的。
    人们来到这里，可以看见在一条长四里多地的渠道和几眼水井上，新安装了各式各样的提水工具一百三十多件。多数是手摇、脚蹬，也有几件是利用畜力、风力和水力带动的。有些适于井上用，有些适于渠道、坑塘、水库用，有些还可井渠两用。它们最引人注意的特点是，一般部件不是木制和竹制的，就是利用废置不用的旧织布机、坏水车、破轿车轮，以及借用轧花机、铡草机、大小车轮、风弓（弹棉花用的）等加以改装搭配而成。参观者普遍认为，这些提水工具的共同优点是：材料好找，容易制造，使用轻便，省钱省铁，社社能造。
    人们还没有走进会场，老远就望见有一架很像大型“走马灯”一样的木制布帆风力车，它有七公尺高，直径达六公尺，中间竖立一根中心柱，四面八方有八根木柱和八面布帆，是会场里最大的一件展品。记者参观时，正好遇上大风天，只见这架风力车自动地飞快旋转着，通过木制的横轴和齿轮，带动两辆龙骨水车在作提水表演，使那渠里的水哗哗作响地涌向人们要它流去的地方。讲解员介绍说：这架风力车是仿照汉沽盐场上使用的风车加以改进的，风力较大的地区可以用它作动力，三级风能带动一辆水车，三级以上风能带动两辆水车，一昼夜能浇地四、五十亩到百亩左右，它的力量相当于一台三点五到七点五马力的锅驼机，但造价至少要比锅驼机低廉一千多元到三千多元。
    会场上人来人往，很多人一走到放在一起、样式相同的织机式大车轮脚蹬双木管水车和织机式大车轮脚蹬双铁管水车的面前，不禁都要停留下来仔细观看，忙着打听改装经过、使用情形、价值多少等问题。有些人忍不住还自己坐了上去，一面用脚蹬动木板，把水由低处提到高处；一面连声称赞：多省劲，真是个好玩意儿！这两架水车都是利用废置不用的织布机的架子，借用大铁车的轮子，只添装一根有两个弯的铁轴和水管、链子等配搭起来的。二者不同的地方只在水管、链子的材料上，一是木制的，管子是方的；一是铁制的，管子是圆的。人们比比看看，议论纷纷，有的人发表了这样的意见：木制的水管、链子浸水以后要发涨，蹬起来比铁制的稍微费点气力；二者的出水量差不多，都是一天浇地九至十二亩左右；而且木制的每套只花十多元（包括买有弯的铁轴，下同）；铁制的每套就要二十多元，木制的可以便宜十来元，还节省了铸铁材料，推广木制水管的这种水车更有普遍意义。
    展出的许许多多利用废置无用的织布机，以及旧的轧花机和风弓等棉花加工机械，加以改装配搭起来的简易提水工具，引起了来自河北主要棉产区——邯郸、石家庄专区的参观者的极大兴趣，他们高兴地说：我们那地方有的是这些东西，坏了的就干脆拿它作水车；好的既可当水车用，冬天仍可进行棉花加工。照这样办，准能又多又快又好又省地解决提水工具问题，这真是一个简而易行、两全其美的好主意。
    给人印象最深的展品，要算武强县农民孙玉山所作的一架纯木制双人手摇水车。这架井渠两用、移动轻便的水车，不但完全没有用铁件，用的全是旧木料，而且木架子上还有数不清的虫眼子。讲解员说：如果买新木料作，花费也不过十元零五角。这架水车因为用的尽是旧木料，安装时只买了一些铁丝和皮钱，用的钱还不到一元哩！听了这样的解说，人们怎得不想想：要是大家都这样精打细算，把一切可以利用的废物废料全拿来变成水车，那农业社就该节省多大一笔资金啊！
    参观者固然极其用心地观看着每一件展品，但当讲解员（他们多数就是展品的制造者）讲述到制造经过时，更使他们听得津津有味。原来，这些展品的制造者，有的是木工和铁工，有的是农民和干部，还有的是回乡参加生产的女学生和裁缝师。他们的这些事迹再一次表明：只要依靠群众，发挥群众的智慧和力量，提水工具供不应求的局面就可大大改观，不能自流灌溉的水利工程就有条件起到浇地作用，农业生产大跃进就会更加有保障。
    这里展出了一架木竹制手摇水车。它的制造者名叫孟祥义，原来是个裁缝师，1954年才回到交河县孟家马头村老家，以后加入农业社当了社员。在去年炎热的夏季，他天天和社员们一起下地车水浇庄稼，看见全社虽有一百三十多眼井，但却只有二十辆水车，眼瞅着个个井里的水都是满汪汪的，可就没法让那些干渴的苗儿喝饱水，这使他很着急。从此，孟祥义每时每刻都在琢磨一个问题：如何仿照龙骨水车的样子制造一种井上用的简易木水车。他的这个想法，虽然曾经遭到有保守思想的部分社干部的怀疑和反对，但是得到了村里党支部书记和乡干部的支持和鼓励。党支部书记还为他找来木头作材料，又指定一名木工专门协助他进行试制。这样，在去年年底的二十多天中，经过最后一次改进，终于制成了这种水车。
    这种水车每辆造价二十元左右，半劳力也能使用，一天能浇四、五亩地。它和解放式水车比较，价钱便宜五、六十元，一天多浇一、二亩地，还节省九十五公斤铁料。现在，这个社的社员们对孟祥义称赞不已，生产劲头也更加高涨，他们正在赶造这种水车，争取不久就要作到井井有水车。
    参观者不只是看看展品就算了，而是很注意学习别人的先进思想和先进经验，从中得到了有益的启示。
    会场上，到处有包围着讲解员的人群，他们边指，边问，还忙着记录，忙着画图，忙着实习操作。一位木业社的主任，一次就画了六十多张图，还详记了尺寸大小。他说，这次参观解放了思想，学到了办法，一回去就要结合当地的具体情况，大量进行仿造和推广。
