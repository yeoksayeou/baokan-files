Notebook

    Gromyko's, the Soviet Foreign Minister, proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference has elicited different reactions in Western countries. One view holds that although the Soviet Union has adopted a flexible attitude in procedural matters, its fundamental stance and objectives have not changed in the slightest. Those who hold this view include officials in Washington, the "New York Times," and the ambassador of a major Western power stationed in Moscow.

    Needless to say, these people are very dissatisfied that the Soviet Union is unwilling to change its fundamental stance and objectives. From this, one can see that the fundamental position of these people is to oppose the convening of a summit conference, because the fundamental position and objective of the Soviet Union is to promote the early convening of a summit conference.

    Hoping that the Soviet Union will change its fundamental stance and objectives on the issue of convening a summit conference can only be a delusional wishful thinking. For those who harbor such delusions, if they do not want to be battered and bruised by the ruthless reality, then the best way is to abandon their delusions as soon as possible!

    痴心妄想
    苏联外长葛罗米柯关于召开外长会议的主张，在西方国家引起了不同的反应。其中有一种意见说，苏联虽然在程序方面采取了灵活的态度，但是它的根本立场和目的却没有丝毫的改变。持这种看法的人有华盛顿的官员、
  “纽约时报”和驻在莫斯科的一个西方大国的大使。
    不用说，这些人对于苏联不肯改变它的根本立场和目的是很不满意的。从这里，人们可以看出，这些人的根本立场是反对召开最高级会议的，因为苏联的根本立场和目的就是促进最高级会议的早日召开。
    企望苏联在召开最高级会议的问题上改变它的根本立场和目的，这只能是一种痴心妄想。对于持有这种妄想的人来说，如果他们不想在无情的现实的面前碰得头破血流，那么，最好的办法还是早日放弃他们的这种妄想吧！
