    Sichuan Central Petroleum Exploration Task is Arduous
    Urgent Need for Nationwide Equipment Support
    (Our newspaper Chengdu, March 24th dispatch) To accomplish the urgent task of rapidly determining the effective oil storage area in the central Sichuan oil region and expanding the scope of drilling this year, what are the main machinery, equipment, and tools and materials that the Sichuan petroleum exploration department urgently needs from all parts of the country? The reporter interviewed the responsible comrades of the Sichuan Petroleum Bureau and the Central Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Office on this issue.
    According to this responsible person, the central Sichuan petroleum exploration task this year has suddenly increased by about fourteen times compared to before the large-scale oil well blowout in early March. The number of new wells to be opened throughout the year reaches one hundred and seventeen, and the first batch of twenty-one medium-deep exploration wells to be newly opened in the second quarter have been decided. Therefore, the demand for various machinery and equipment is extremely large. In addition to the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau actively trying to transfer equipment from relevant exploration areas across the country, the main machinery, equipment, and tools that urgently need to be purchased and ordered from all over the country are: wheeled cranes, generators, high-voltage lines, high-voltage gates, water pumps, steel wire ropes, mud, gasoline engines, and oil输送 pipelines, etc.
    The Central Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Office has now prepared a supply plan for machinery, equipment, and tools for the second quarter, requesting prompt allocation from the higher authorities. According to reports: the demand for such machinery, equipment, and tools will continue to increase in the future, and continued support from all regions will be needed.

    川中石油勘探任务艰巨
    急需全国支援设备
    本报成都24日专电　四川石油勘探部门目前迫切需要全国各地支援哪些主要机器设备和工具材料，在今年迅速查明川中油区的有效储油面积和扩大钻探范围的紧急任务？记者就这个问题，访问了四川石油局和川中石油勘探处的负责同志。
    据这位负责人谈，今年川中石油勘探任务，比3月中旬各钻井大量喷油之前，骤然增加了十四倍左右。全年新开的钻井达一百一十七口，第二季度决定新开的第一批中深探井二十一口，因之各项机器设备的需要量极大。现在除石油工业部、四川石油勘探局积极设法从国内有关各探区抽调外，目前迫切需要在全国各地购置和订货的主要机器设备和工具有：轮带式吊车、发电机、高压线、高压闸门、水泵、钢丝绳、泥浆、汽油引擎和输油管等等。
    现在川中石油勘探处已经编制了第二季度机器设备工具的供应计划，请求上级迅速调拨。据谈：今后这类的机器设备和工具的需要量将不断增加，需要各地继续予以支援。
