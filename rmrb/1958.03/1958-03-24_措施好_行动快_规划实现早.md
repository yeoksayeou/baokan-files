    Good Measures, Quick Action, Early Realization of Plans
    Seven steel plants in Hebei Province have already started construction and will be put into production in three to five months; the construction of eleven steel plants scheduled to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan can all begin this year.
    Special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 23rd: In the large-scale development of local iron and steel industry in Hebei Province, the province opposes empty talk and acts decisively. All eleven small and medium-sized steel plants planned to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan will start construction this year. Currently, seven steel plants have already started construction. According to the plan, by 1961, the local iron and steel industry in the province will leap from scratch to an annual output of more than 2,547,000 tons of pig iron and 1,050,000 tons of steel.
    Hebei Province has decided to adopt the construction principle of making use of existing conditions, starting small and growing bigger, and using phased construction to develop the local iron and steel industry. According to the current equipment, technology and financial conditions, the focus will be on developing small blast furnaces with a daily output of ten to one hundred tons in the next two years, striving to produce iron and steel as soon as possible. The investment in the twenty-five small blast furnaces to be built this year is not large, and most of them can be built and put into production in just three to five months. Currently, five small blast furnaces have been put into production or are about to be put into production. By the second half of next year, the province will have an annual output of more than 1,070,000 tons of pig iron and 200,000 tons of steel. This will not only quickly supply the iron and steel raw materials needed by the province's local industry, but also accumulate experience, funds, and cultivate technical forces for future expansion.
    When preparing to build steel plants, various localities broke with conventions and adopted the method of simultaneously carrying out design, procurement of equipment, preparation of materials, training of workers, and raising funds, which greatly advanced the construction time of the plants. According to the old method in the past, the construction preparation work for building a plant generally took half a year to a year, but now it only takes three to four months to start building the plant. A steel plant under construction in Shijiazhuang City with an annual output of 320,000 tons of pig iron and 200,000 tons of steel has already started construction of three small blast furnaces, which can be put into production in the second quarter. In addition, two larger small blast furnaces will soon be put into construction.
    Responsible cadres from many special districts and cities in Hebei Province personally took charge of the preparatory work for building steel plants and promptly solved the problems in the construction of the plants. The funds used for building steel plants throughout the province this year are mainly raised through self-reliance. The investment in the Shijiazhuang City Steel Plant is entirely raised by the city itself. In the next two years, the city will take out more than 9 million yuan to build the steel plant.
    Hebei Province has abundant iron ore reserves with high iron content, and it is also an important base for the production of coking coal in China. The transportation is also very convenient, which is very suitable for the extensive construction of steel plants. The eleven small and medium-sized steel plants currently determined are distributed in seven cities and two special districts, including Handan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Chengde, Baoding, Xingtai, and Xuanhua. According to the situation that many counties in the province have iron ore resources, Hebei Province is actively studying the issue of how counties can build steel plants.

    措施好　行动快　规划实现早
    河北省七座钢铁厂已经动工，三、五个月就可投入生产；预定第二个五年计划期间兴建的十一座钢铁厂，今年可以全部开始建设。
    本报特约新华社保定23日电　河北省在大量发展地方钢铁工业中，反对纸上谈兵，说干就干，全省计划在第二个五年计划期间兴建的十一座中小型钢铁厂，今年将全部开始建设。目前，有七座钢铁厂已经动工兴建。按照规划，到1961年，全省地方钢铁工业将从无到有，跃进到能年产生铁二百五十四万七千多吨，钢一百零五万吨。
    河北省发展地方钢铁工业，决定采取因陋就简、从小到大的建设方针，采用分期建设的方法。根据现有设备、技术和资金条件，今明两年将着重发展日产十吨到一百吨的小高炉，争取尽快生产出钢铁来。今年建设的二十五个小高炉，投资都不多，一般的只要三、五个月就可以建成投入生产。目前，有五座小高炉已经投入生产和将要投入生产。到明年下半年，全省将年产生铁一百零七万多吨，钢二十万吨。这样，不但可以很快地供应全省地方工业需要的钢铁原料，而且为以后扩大建设规模积累了经验、资金，培养了技术力量。
    各地在筹建钢铁厂时，打破常规，采取了设计、采购设备、备料、培养工人和筹集资金齐头并进的办法，大大地提早了建厂时间。按照过去的老办法，建厂的施工准备工作一般需要半年到一年的时间，现在只要三至四个月就可以开始建厂。石家庄市兴建的一座年产三十二万吨生铁、二十万吨钢的钢铁厂，现在已有三个小高炉动工建设，第二季度可以投入生产，另外有两个较大的小高炉，不久即可动工兴建。
    河北省许多专区、市的负责干部亲自挂帅，领导钢铁厂筹建工作，及时解决建厂中的问题。今年全省用于兴办钢铁厂的资金，主要采用自力更生的办法。石家庄市钢铁厂的投资，完全由这个市自行筹集。今明两年，这个市要拿出九百多万元用来建设钢铁厂。
    河北省铁矿蕴藏量丰富，含铁量高，又是我国出产炼焦煤的重要基地，交通也很便利，很适宜于广泛兴建钢铁厂。现在确定的十一座中小型钢铁厂，分布在邯郸、石家庄、唐山、承德、保定、邢台、宣化等七个市、二个专区。根据全省许多县都有铁矿资源的情况，河北省正在积极研究县如何兴办钢铁厂的问题。
