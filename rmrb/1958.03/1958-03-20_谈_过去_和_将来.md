    On "The Past" and "The Future"
    Guan Feng

    Some friends criticize Communists for "belittling the past and being superstitious about the future." This statement is correct; Communists do, in a certain sense, "belittle" the past and "are superstitious" (firmly believe) in the future. However, this is not only not a defect, but also a great truth of human life. Can we "be superstitious about the past and doubt the future"? Or can we "belittle the future and value the past"?

    What is the "future"? The "future" is the era of communism, the era of conquering the universe. The sum of human history is very small compared to it. Of course, we must value this "future." Based on Marxism-Leninism, based on the dialectical and historical materialism world view, and based on the practice of social life, Communists are convinced that this "future" is infinitely beautiful and is sure to arrive. We are convinced that human history can only have such an infinitely beautiful future, and will never have any other dark future. It is acceptable to call this kind of confidence "superstition" in a certain sense, that is to say, it is not ordinary "belief," but "firm belief" – firmly believed in the past, firmly believed now, and still firmly believed in the future (the future of the future); firmly believed when the sky is clear, and still firmly believed to the same extent when the sky is cloudy. The "superstition" usually referred to, although it also has the firmness of "going forward and never returning," is based on blind foundations, and therefore can be broken after all. Therefore, if the word "superstition" must be used to describe the Communists' confidence in the "future," then at least a few "doubles" must be added, more "superstitious" than "superstition"... , it is something that cannot be broken. Without such a bit of "superstition," how can we move forward to do revolutionary work? Some people lack a little "superstition" in the "future," or "believe" but not "superstitiously" (firmly), so they secretly shed tears when temporary dark clouds roll over, or sigh everywhere, and even become discouraged everywhere, and even unconsciously help the rightists who are "superstitious" about capitalism. It can be seen that "superstition" in the future is extremely precious, and it is not easy to obtain.

    Communists believe in evolution, but in the field of social history, evolution must be combined with class theory. We firmly oppose vulgar evolutionism that excludes class theory and revolutionary leaps forward. However, we firmly believe that history is evolving. Monkeys do not believe in evolution; they probably think that their ancestral habits and lifestyles are absolutely good and cannot be changed. That's why they cannot evolve and always walk on four legs. Humans evolved from monkeys, but conservative monkeys will always be monkeys.

    Old Mrs. Nine Pounds said: "Each generation is not as good as the last." We must reverse it: "Each generation is stronger than the last." This principle, probably no one opposes it now, right?! However, some people still have a bit of the taste of Old Mrs. Nine Pounds in their lives, and there are even Old Mrs. Nine Pounds who are completely unchanged! When the rightists clamored "the present is not as good as the past," some people became confused, and even felt that what they said made some sense; I think one of the reasons is that the Old Mrs. Nine Pounds in the spiritual world is making trouble, lacking a little "superstition" in the future and having a little more superstition in the past.

    Communists are historical materialists, and firmly oppose ahistoricism and nihilism that sever history in work and scientific research. But at the same time, they firmly oppose conservatism and restorationism. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly called on us to study history, and historical science must be greatly developed. Economic history, political history, cultural history, natural science history, and more specifically, philosophy history, literary history, poetry history, literary criticism history, chemistry history, medicine history... all need to be strengthened in research. From this perspective, we do not belittle history at all, but value it very much; however, from another perspective, we must belittle history. Studying history is by no means about imitating it, and researching history is by no means about being a preserver of national essence. We believe that Marxism-Leninism is the highest achievement of human cultural development, and modern natural science is the highest achievement of human understanding and transforming nature. Standing on the base of the highest achievement and looking back at the past, we must belittle the past. Is there any great thought of any great thinker in history that can be compared with Marx's theory? No, they are too far apart from Marx's theory, they are simply not comparable, because they were in the era of human infancy! Precisely because there is such a little belittling, when we study history, we must use Marxism and modern science as weapons to analyze and criticize it, give it a scientific evaluation and due historical position, and especially summarize the laws of cultural development and the regular experience and lessons of former people's rational thinking. Only in this way can we truly respect history, and can we truly accept the cultural heritage. If someone engaged in the history of philosophy takes Lao Tzu's five thousand words and hangs them on the wall like the Dunhuang murals to appreciate them, what kind of acceptance of philosophical heritage is that? Without using Marxist weapons for criticism, there is no way to truly accept the cultural heritage. I think that we have such a little "belittling" of the ancients, and use Marxism to critically study their achievements, the ancients will not be angry. If they knew, they would say: Good! This is how our excellent children and grandchildren should act! We lived in the era of human infancy, and our doctrines once played an active and progressive role. Now that you have achieved such high achievements, it is great to analyze and criticize our doctrines to accept experience and lessons. This is for your present and future! Just hope you always look forward. Maybe Zhuangzi still stubbornly clings to his old set: "These words, their name is paradoxical, after ten thousand generations, and once meeting a great sage, knowing its solution, is a meeting morning and evening." Then, we have to say to him: "Old Sir, you should give up on that idea!"

    Old Mrs. Nine Pounds is not like that. She said: "The moon was also round in the pre-Qin period!" Such emphasis on history is the most barbaric way to trample on history – more than just generally trampling on history!

    Unfortunately, the ghost of Old Mrs. Nine Pounds has not dissipated, and often possesses a few people who study history to make trouble.

    Take the study of the history of Chinese philosophy, for example. Some friends attach great importance to accepting the philosophical heritage, and their wishes are very good. However, they mistakenly put "negation" (sublation) and acceptance of philosophical heritage in absolute opposition, which in fact denies the use of Marxism to criticize ancient philosophical thought. What they call accepting the philosophical heritage is to find ready-made things from ancient philosophical thought, things that are not found in Marxist philosophy, and readily take them over to use better than Marxist philosophy. Such emphasis on ancient philosophy is unacceptable; there are no such good things in ancient philosophy. For example, when we study the pre-Qin simple materialist theory of the Five Elements, do we still use the generation and overcoming of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth to understand the universe today? Hasn't Marxist philosophy and modern science made highly scientific explanations of the material composition of the objective world? For example, the brilliant ancient saying "opposites complement each other," if we take it readily and in isolation, what philosophical significance does it have? It is far less scientific than the proposition "the unity and struggle of opposites." For another example, Fan Zhen's philosophy has erected an immortal milestone in the history of the development of materialism; his proposition of "benefit and blade" (regarding the relationship between spirit and matter) is still brilliant today. But if we take it readily, what philosophical significance does it have? Hasn't Marxist philosophy made a highly scientific explanation of the relationship between matter and spirit? Talking about this, some people may ask: In this case, doesn't it mean that studying the history of Chinese philosophy is meaningless? Or is its significance not great? I don't mean that, but rather that the method used must be correct. I think we can make such a metaphor: the work of studying the history of philosophy is like a mature thinker, reflecting on his own thought process from childhood. This kind of reflection is not nostalgia or admiration for the past, praising it, or holding it high; but rather using the current level of thought to conduct a scientific analysis of this process. The purpose of this analysis is not to find good things from the way of thinking in childhood that are fundamentally lacking in one's current way of thinking and readily use them. The maturity of a thinker is a long-term development process. In essence, the good things in his way of thinking in childhood are already contained in his current thinking. However, after a thinker matures, it is very necessary to reflect on and analyze the history of thought development since childhood (his maturation process is inseparable from this reflection). To conduct this kind of reflection and analysis, of course, it is necessary to consider what things were thought correctly in the past, what things were thought incorrectly, and what the consequences were, etc. However, what is more important is the law of development of the contradiction and struggle between two kinds of thoughts and two kinds of thought methods; how were relatively correct thoughts and thought methods achieved in the thinking process, and what shortcomings are there, and how were these shortcomings produced (limited by what conditions? How did these conditions limit understanding?) Where did erroneous thoughts and thought methods go astray, how did they go astray, and how did they turn truth into falsehood, etc. Making scientific summaries of these and discovering their regularity is an extremely important and indispensable aspect for the forward development of a mature thinker. – I think that the study of the history of Chinese philosophy should have such a purpose, and should use the Marxist method of criticism. Only in this way can we truly accept the philosophical heritage, and can we scientifically summarize the regular experience and lessons of the ancients' rational thinking, so as to help the younger generation grasp Marxist philosophy as soon as possible, and enrich and develop Marxist philosophy.

    However, some people lack that little "belittling" that we mentioned above, or even have some superstition, and are unwilling to use Marxism to criticize ancient philosophical thought. In the lighter cases, for example, the defects of ancient materialism and dialectical thinking are not criticized, or are only lightly glossed over with the phrase "limitations of the times." As for what specific conditions the ancients were limited by, how they were limited, why the ancients would go astray, how they went astray, etc., they do not analyze or rarely analyze and criticize them. In order to turn the history of philosophy into science, for the sake of the actual struggle, and for the sake of creating a better future, this "kindness" towards the ancients is unnecessary. In the more serious cases, for example, they wholeheartedly try to find good things from ancient philosophy that can be readily used, to the point of far-fetched associations, beautifying the ancients, and even "praising the old and criticizing the present." As a result, the saying that Confucius was a dialectical materialist came out, and the saying that Gongsun Long's philosophy was unprecedented and unparalleled also came out. There is also what "the doctrine of the mean" touched on social existence determining social consciousness, "sincerity comes from nature" is objective determining the subjective, "enlightenment comes from teaching" is the subjective reacting on the objective, also came out. To the point of saying that the realm required by the ancients' moral cultivation was very high, and lamenting that today's revolutionaries have not paid attention to absorbing nutrients from feudal morality and its cultivation methods to strengthen communist cultivation; to the point of saying "looking at the sages of the feudal era, we are inferior." This is worthy of our deep thought: what exactly is more and what is less in their spiritual world?

    Without that little "belittling" of the past, and excessively "valuing" or being superstitious about it, then one will "belittle the present," "criticize the present," and even turn the future into "the past." This is the case for the study of the history of Chinese philosophy, and it is also the case for the study of other historical sciences, although they each have their own characteristics.

    Because Old Mrs. Nine Pounds was superstitious about the "past," she obliterated the "present," and there was no "future" in her eyes. Old Mrs. Nine Pounds has long since died, but it seems that some work still needs to be done to eliminate the thinking of Old Mrs. Nine Pounds.

    谈“过去”和“将来”
    关锋
    有的朋友批评共产党人“轻视过去，迷信将来”。这话倒是对的，共产党人在一定意义上确是“轻视”过去、“迷信”（笃信）将来的。然而，这不仅不是缺点，而且是人类生活的伟大真理。难道我们可以“迷信过去，怀疑将来”吗？或者可以“轻视将来，重视过去”吗？
    “将来”是什么？“将来”是共产主义的时代，是征服宇宙的时代。人类历史的总和同它比较起来也是非常渺小的。对于这个“将来”，我们当然是要重视的。共产党人依据马克思列宁主义，依据辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的宇宙观，依据社会生活的实践，确信这个“将来”是无限美好的，是一定要到来的。我们确信，人类历史只能有这样无限美好的将来，而绝不会有什么另外别的、灰暗的将来。在一定意义上把这种信心叫作“迷信”也是可以的，这就是说，它不是普通的“信”，而是“笃信”——过去笃信，现在笃信，将来仍然笃信（将来的将来）；晴天的时候笃信，阴天的时候仍然是同等程度地笃信。通常所说的“迷信”，虽然也具有“一往而不返”的坚固性，但是它是建立在盲目的基础之上的，因而也终究是可以打破的。因此，如果一定要用“迷信”这个字眼来形容共产党人对于“将来”的这种信心的话，那末至少还得来几个“加倍”，比“迷信”更“迷信”……，它是什么东西也打不破的。如果没有这么一点子“迷信”，那又怎么能够一往直前地做革命事业呢？有些人正是少了一点对“将来”的“迷信”，或“信”而不“迷”（笃），所以在一时乌云乱翻的时候就暗中流泪，或者到处叹气，以至到处泄气，以至不自觉地帮了“迷信”资本主义的右派的忙。可见对于将来的“迷信”是极宝贵的，而且得来也是很不容易的。
    共产党人是相信进化论的，不过，在社会历史领域中要把进化论同阶级论结合起来。排斥阶级论、排斥革命跃进的庸俗进化论，我们是坚决反对的。但是，我们坚决相信历史是进化的。猴子是不相信进化论的，它们大概是认为它们的祖传习惯和生活方式是绝对好的，是不能改变的。所以它们才不得进化，老是用四条腿走路。人是由猴子变化而来的，可是守旧的猴子却永远是猴子。
    九斤老太说：“一代不如一代”。我们必须把它反过来：“一代强过一代”。这道理，现在未必还有人反对吧？！但是，有些人在生活中却多少有点九斤老太的味道，甚至还有原封未动的九斤老太呢！当右派分子叫嚣“今不如昔”的时候，有些人迷惑起来，甚至还觉得他们说得多少有点道理；我想原因之一就是精神世界里的九斤老太作怪，少了一点“迷信”将来，多了一点迷信过去。
    共产党人是历史唯物主义者，是坚决反对工作中和科学研究中的割断历史的非历史主义和虚无主义的，但是，同时坚决反对守旧主义和复古主义。党中央一再号召我们学习历史，历史科学是要大大地发展的。经济史、政治史、文化史、自然科学史，更专门一点，哲学史、文学史、诗史、文学批评史、化学史、医学史……都要加强研究。从这一方面说，我们对历史决不是轻视，而是十分重视；但是，从另外一方面说，我们却是要轻视历史的。学习历史决不是要照样模仿，研究历史决不是作国粹保管员。我们认为，马克思列宁主义是人类文化发展的最高成就，现代自然科学是人类认识自然、改造自然的最高成就。站在最高成就的基地上看过去，我们对过去是要轻视的。难道历史上有什么伟大思想家的伟大思想，可以同马克思的理论相比拟吗？没有的，它们比马克思的理论相差得太远太远了，简直是不可同日而语的，因为它们是处在人类幼年的时代啊！正因为有这样一点轻视，我们研究历史，就要用马克思主义、现代科学作武器去进行分析批判，给以科学的评价和应有的历史地位，特别是总结文化发展的规律和前人理维思维的规律性的经验教训。只有这样，才是真正尊重历史，也才能真正接受文化遗产。如果搞哲学史的把“老子”五千言拿来，像敦煌壁画一样地挂在墙上欣赏，那算得什么接受哲学遗产呢？不用马克思主义武器进行批判，是谈不到真正接受文化遗产的。我看，我们对古人有这么一点儿“轻视”，用马克思主义去批判研究他们的成就，古人是不会生气的。如果他们有知，那就会说：好啊！这样做才是我们的优秀儿孙啊！我们当年是生活在人类幼年时代，我们那些学说曾经起过积极的进步作用，现在你们达到了这样高的成就，分析批判我们的学说以接受经验教训真是太好了。这样做是为了你们的现今和将来啊！只望你们永远向前看就好了。也许庄子还固执他那老一套：“是其言也，其名为吊诡，万世之后，而一遇大圣，知其解者，是旦暮之遇也。”那末，我们只好对他说：“老先生，你还是死了那条心吧！”
    九斤老太则不然。她说：“月亮也是先秦的圆！”这样重视历史，是最蛮横地糟蹋历史，——岂只一般糟蹋历史而已！
    可惜，九斤老太的阴魂不散，还时常附在少数研究历史的人身上作怪。
    就说中国哲学史的研究吧，有的朋友很重视接受哲学遗产，他们的愿望是很好的。但是，他们却错误地把“否定”（扬弃）同接受哲学遗产绝对对立起来，这在实际上就是否认用马克思主义批判古代哲学思想。他们所谓接受哲学遗产，就是从古代哲学思想中找现成的东西，找马克思主义哲学中所没有的、现成地拿过来比马克思主义哲学还好使用的东西。对古代哲学的这种重视是要不得的，那样的好东西在古代哲学中是没有的。例如，我们研究先秦的朴素唯物主义五行说吧，难道我们今天还要以金木水火土相生相克去认识宇宙吗？马克思主义哲学、现代科学不是对客观世界的物质构成作了高度科学的说明吗？例如“相反相成”这个光辉的古语，如果孤立地把它现成地拿过来，那从哲学上说究竟有什么意义呢？它远不如“对立面的统一和斗争”这个命题科学。再例如范缜的哲学，在唯物主义的发展史上树立了一座不朽的里程碑；他的“利之与刃”（关于精神和物质的关系）的命题，直到今天也还是光辉的。但是如果把它现成地拿过来，那从哲学上说有什么意义呢？马克思主义哲学不是对物质同精神的关系作了高度的科学说明吗？谈到这里，也许有人会问：如此说来，岂不是研究中国哲学史没有意思了吗？或是意义不大了吗？我不是这个意思，而是说用的方法要对头。我以为可以打个这样的比喻：哲学史研究工作，好像一个成熟的思想家，反省他自己从幼年以来的思想过程的本身。这种反省不是对于过去的留恋或欣赏，而赞叹之，而高捧之；而是以现在达到的思想水平，对这个过程进行科学的分析。进行这种分析的目的，不在于从幼年的想事方法中找寻自己现在思想方法中所根本没有的好东西现成地拿来使用。思想家的成熟是一个长期发展的过程。从本质上说，他幼年想事方法中的好东西已经包含在他现在的思想中了。但是，一个思想家成熟以后，对自幼以来的思想发展史，进行反省、分析却是非常必要的（他的成熟过程就是离不开这种反省的）。进行这种反省、分析，当然需要考虑过去什么事想对了，什么事想错了，引起的后果是什么，等等。然而，更加重要的却是，两种思想、两种思想方法矛盾斗争的发展规律；比较正确的思想、思想方法在思维过程中是怎样达到的，还有哪些缺陷，这些缺陷是怎样产生的（受什么条件的限制？这些条件怎样限制了认识？）错误的思想、思想方法是在什么地方失足的，是怎样失足的，怎样把真理变成了谬误，等等。对这些作出科学的总结，发现其规律性，对于一个成熟的思想家向前发展是极为重要的不可缺少的一个方面。——我以为研究中国哲学史应该抱这样的目的，应该用马克思主义批判的方法。只有这样做，才能真正地接受哲学遗产，才能科学地总结出古人理维思维的规律性的经验教训，以帮助青年一代尽快地掌握马克思主义哲学，并丰富和发展马克思主义哲学。
    但是，有些人缺少我们上边所说的那样一点“轻视”，或者还有些迷信，就不肯用马克思主义批判古代哲学思想。轻者，例如对古代的唯物主义、辩证法思想的缺陷不加批判，或者只用“时代的局限性”一语轻轻带过。至于古人受什么具体条件的限制，是怎样被限制的，古人为什么会失足，是怎样失足的，等等，他们就不加或很少加以分析、批判了。为了把哲学史变成科学，为了现实的斗争，为了创造更美好的将来，对于古人的这种“厚道”是不必要的。重者，例如一心一意地去从古代哲学中去找现成地拿来使用的好东西，以至牵强附会，美化古人，以至“颂古非今”。于是，孔子是辩证唯物主义者的说法出来了，公孙龙的哲学空前绝后的说法也出来了。还有什么“中庸”接触到了社会存在决定社会意识，“自诚明，谓之性”是客观决定主观，“自明诚，谓之教”是主观反作用于客观，也出来了。以至说什么古人道德修养要求的境界是很高的，而慨叹现今的革命者没有注意从封建道德及其修养方法中吸取营养料，来加强共产主义的修养；以至说“看看封建时代的先哲，我们是有逊色的了。”这是值得我们深思的：他们的精神世界里，究竟是多了一点什么？少了一点什么呢？
    对过去，没有那么一点“轻视”，而过分地“重视”或迷信，那末就会“轻今”、“非今”，以至把将来也“过去化了”的。对于中国哲学史的研究说来是如此，对于其他各门历史科学的研究说来也是如此，虽然它们各有各的特点。
    九斤老太因为迷信“过去”，所以她就抹煞“现今”，她的眼中也就没有“将来”。九斤老太早已寿终正寝，然而清除九斤老太的思想，看来还是得做一些工作的。
