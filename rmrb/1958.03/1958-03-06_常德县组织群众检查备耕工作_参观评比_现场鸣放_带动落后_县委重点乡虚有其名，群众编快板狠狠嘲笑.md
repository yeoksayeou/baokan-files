Xinhua News Agency, Changde, March 5th Special Dispatch: Changde County, Hunan Province, recently adopted methods such as on-site airing of views and composing doggerel to carry out mass inspections and comparisons, promoting the current spring plowing preparation work.

The 2,532 township and commune cadres participating in the evaluation and inspection were divided into three visiting inspection groups, which went to several townships for three days of on-site evaluation and inspection. Responsible persons from the Changde Prefectural Committee and Changde County Committee of the Communist Party of China participated in the on-site evaluation activities.

Entering Qiliqiao Township, the County Party Committee believed that this township had always been a key area of the County Party Committee. The township Party Committee's First Secretary was also the County Party Committee's Propaganda Minister, and the Second Secretary was also the former District Party Committee Secretary, so production should be similar to other areas. However, upon entering the township, the County Party Committee members were shocked. Production was not similar, but far behind. The visitors composed doggerel on the spot:

"Qiliqiao, Qiliqiao, it's dangerous if you don't work harder. Not much fertilizer, poor quality, how to deal with false reports. Reporting 300 dan of fertilizer per mu, but in reality, not even 200 dan. Inspecting Yueliangshan (commune), reporting 300 dan of fertilizer; inspecting back and forth, only 63 dan per mu. Dry grass skin, infuriating, neither composted nor smoked. Engaging in smoked fertilizer as a model, three straws as the core, whether it's smoked well or not, no one from top to bottom asks. Home fertilizer collection is even more terrible, the commune is empty as if washed, the private plots are piled with manure. Private vegetables are dark and green, collective spring harvest cries for help. 'Rain Water' has passed for several days, but there's no manure to make seedling beds."

The doggerel also helped the township find the reasons for the poor preparation work: "Everyone wants to ask about Qiliqiao, why is the preparation work so bad? The key lies in the leadership. Secretary Zhang Piwang is used to making emotional outbursts. Running a key commune privately, making a mess of things, the work is floating, and he often complains. If you criticize him, he slams the table and stamps his feet. He doesn't read instructions, thinking he knows everything."

The representatives also commented on the experimental field of Wu Zhongping, the Township Party Committee's First Secretary and County Party Committee member:

"Secretary Wu, experimental field, only a dozen dan of fertilizer, setting a target of 1,300, only shouting to heaven for a great leap."

These sharp criticisms greatly educated the cadres of Qiliqiao Township. That evening, the Party Committee held a meeting, and they all made painful self-criticisms, deciding to work hard for fifteen days to transform from backward to advanced. In the five days after the inspection, the township's daily attendance rate rose from less than half of the total population to 71%. In five days, they increased the accumulation of soil fertilizer by 60 dan per mu and collected more than 8,000 dan of household fertilizer. Over 15,000 mu of green manure was universally top-dressed. More than 800 head of cattle were mobilized, plowing most of the winter paddy fields once, and the seedling beds were harrowed once. Party Committee Secretary Wu Zhongping added 90 dan of fertilizer to his three mu experimental field and added a harrowing. On February 27th, during a blizzard, he took the lead in carrying pond mud. An unprecedented production upsurge appeared throughout the township.

When visiting Qianjiaping Township, the representatives used doggerel to praise their enthusiasm:

"Entering Qianjiaping, the paddy fields are as flat as a mirror, the weeding is clean, the fertilizer is 700 dan. Everyone is working hard, shouts fill the mountains, production is leaping forward, you are number one." Many representatives examined their complacency and laxity on the spot. Representatives from Haozigang Township, who originally thought that they could not plow the fields now, said after visiting Qianjiaping's plowing that they would mobilize spring plowing as soon as they returned.

The Changde County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized this visit, evaluation, and inspection work, believing that it was an effective way to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in leadership and promote current production. It was a good way to encourage advanced elements, help backward elements, and drive the middle elements. It was decided to regularize and institutionalize the evaluation and inspection work. It was stipulated that county-wide evaluations and inspections would be conducted once per quarter, each township would be inspected every ten days, and each agricultural cooperative would be inspected every seven days.

    常德县组织群众检查备耕工作
    参观评比　现场鸣放　带动落后
    县委重点乡虚有其名，群众编快板狠狠嘲笑
    本报特约新华社常德5日电　湖南省常德县最近采取现场鸣放、编快板等办法，开展群众性的检查评比，推动了当前的备耕工作。
    参加评比检查的二千五百三十二个乡社干部分成三个参观检查团，分赴几个乡，进行了三天的实地评比检查。中共常德地委、常德县委负责人都参加了实地评比活动。
    走进七里桥乡，县委认为这个乡一直是县委重点，乡党委第一书记是县委宣传部长兼的，第二书记也是原来的区委书记，生产应该差不多。但走进乡里，县委们都大吃一惊。生产不是差不多，而是差得远。参观的人就地编了快板：
    “七里桥，七里桥，再不努力危险了。肥料不多，质量不高，弄假虚报怎开交。上报肥料每亩三百担，其实二百担也不到。检查一个月亮山（社），上报肥料三百担；翻来复去一检查，每亩只有六十三。干草皮，气死人，既不沤又不熏。搞熏肥，够典型，三根稻草当包心，到底熏好未熏好，从上到下无人问。家肥收集更要命，社里空空如水洗，自留土上堆满粪。私人菜蔬乌又青，集体春收喊救命。‘雨水’已过好几天，要做秧田没大粪。”
    快板还帮助这个乡找出备耕工作不好的原因：“大家要问七里桥，为啥备耕这样糟？关键在领导。书记张丕望，惯把情绪闹。自办重点社，搞得稀糟糟，工作飘荡荡，经常发牢骚。若要批评他，拍桌蹬脚吵。指示他不看，自认都知道。”
        代表们还在乡党委第一书记、县委委员吴仲平的丰产试验田边评了一番：
    “吴书记，试验田，肥料只有十几担，订产一千三，跃进只有喊皇天。”
    这些尖锐的批评，对七里桥乡干部有很大教育。当晚，就召开了党委会，都沉痛地进行了自我检讨，决定拼命干十五天，变落后为先进。检查后五天中，全乡每天出勤率由原来占总人口不到一半上升到71％。五天每亩增积土肥六十担，还收集家肥八千多担。一万五千多亩绿肥普遍追了一次肥。全乡八百多头耕牛出动，把大部分冬水田翻耕一次，秧田都加了一次犁耙。党委书记吴仲平在自己的三亩试验田里，增施了九十担肥料，加了一道犁耙。2月27日大风雪天，他带头挑塘泥。全乡出现了空前未有的生产高潮。
    代表们在钱家坪乡参观时，又用快板夸奖他们的干劲：
    “一入钱家坪，水田平如镜，三光铲得净，肥料七百零。大家干劲大，满山?喝声，生产跃进中，数你第一名。”很多代表当场检查了自己的自满松气思想。原先认为现在不能犁田的蒿子港乡代表，在参观钱家坪犁田后，表示回去就发动春耕。
    中共常德县委总结了这次参观评比检查工作，认为这是克服领导上的官僚主义、主观主义，推动当前生产的有效办法，是鼓励先进，帮助落后，带动中间的好办法，决定把评比检查工作经常化、制度化。规定全县性的评比检查每季度一次，各乡每十天检查一次，农业社每七天检查一次。
