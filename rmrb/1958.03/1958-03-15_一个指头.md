    One Finger
    Reading "The Construction of Zhengzhou," I was reminded of how to treat shortcomings in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.
    Just like transforming the three-thousand-year-old city of Zhengzhou in just a few years, the people of the whole country have accomplished countless earth-shaking feats since the founding of New China. Socialist transformation, socialist construction, truly, since Pan Gu separated heaven and earth, from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors until now, who in our great China has ever seen such a thing? The reporter Fan Rongkang is right, who can pat their chest and say, "If I do it, I will absolutely not make mistakes" when doing this unprecedented thing?
    Now the Double-Anti movement has been launched, and many past phenomena of waste and conservatism have been exposed, and some of the details are quite serious. Some people are frightened by these phenomena and feel gloomy in their hearts. Some people maintain a correct view: these shortcomings, compared with the achievements, are only one finger out of ten.
    Yes, this is just a sick finger. We neither avoid medical treatment, hiding it; nor do we make a fuss, being pessimistic and disappointed, but actively treat it like Zhengzhou City.

    一个指头
    读着“郑州的建设”，想起了反浪费反保守运动中如何对待缺点的问题。
    像短短几年把三千年古城——郑州市改造得面目一新一样，新中国成立以来，全国人民干出了无数翻天复地的事业。社会主义改造，社会主义建设，真是自从盘古开天地，三皇五帝到如今，堂堂华夏有谁见过？记者范荣康说得对，干这种前无古人的事情，谁能拍拍胸脯说：“让我来搞就绝对不犯错误”？
    现在双反运动掀起来了，许多过去的浪费和保守现象被揭发出来，有些情节还相当严重。有的人被这些现象吓住了，心里感觉灰溜溜的。有些人保持着正确的看法：这些缺点同成绩比较起来，不过是十个指头中的一个指头。
    是的，这仅仅是一个生了病的指头。我们既不讳疾忌医，把它掩盖起来；也不大惊小怪，悲观失望，而是像郑州市那样积极地去医治它。
