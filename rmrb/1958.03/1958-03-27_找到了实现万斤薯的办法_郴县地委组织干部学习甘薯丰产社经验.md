    Found a Way to Achieve 10,000 Jin Sweet Potatoes
    Chen County Party Committee Organizes Cadres to Study the Experience of High-Yield Sweet Potato Cooperatives
    (Our Newspaper News) The CPC Chen County Party Committee in Hunan Province recently held a meeting of county party secretaries (with the participation of some technical cadres) in the Dacheng No. 1 Cooperative of Yongxing County, which created the nation's highest sweet potato yield per mu. The meeting summarized the cooperative's high-yield experience on the spot and specifically reviewed and studied how to achieve a 10,000-jin sweet potato special zone this year.
    The Chen County Special Zone has many mountains and little farmland. This year, it will plant 900,000 mu of sweet potatoes, requiring an average yield of 10,000 jin per mu. However, some cooperative cadres and members believe that sweet potato fields require deep digging, which is difficult due to lack of tools and excessive labor; the fertilizer requirement is as high as that for paddy fields, which is impossible to achieve; and there will be difficulties in processing large quantities of sweet potatoes.
    In order to solve the above problems, the meeting organized attendees to visit the Dacheng No. 1 Cooperative and observe a complete production process including hotbed nursery, compost making, deep soil digging, transplanting, fertilization, and harvesting. After this study, the attendees unanimously believed that by taking these measures, they would be able to achieve the leap forward target.

    找到了实现万斤薯的办法
    郴县地委组织干部学习甘薯丰产社经验
    本报讯　中共湖南郴县地委最近在创造全国甘薯亩产最高纪录的永兴县大城一社召开了县委书记（有部分技术干部参加）会议，实地总结这个社的丰产经验，具体检查和研究了今年如何实现万斤甘薯专区。
    郴县专区山多田少，今年将种甘薯九十万亩，要求平均亩产一万斤。但是，有一些社干部和社员认为，甘薯地要深挖，没有工具，用的劳力也太多；肥料要求达到与稻田一样多，办不到；甘薯多了不好处理。
    为了解决以上问题，会议组织了到会人员到大城一社参观了温床育苗、制堆肥、挖深土、插秧、施肥、收获一套生产过程。经过这次学习，到会人员一致认为：采取这些措施，实现跃进指标就有了把握。
