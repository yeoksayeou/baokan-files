Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 27th — A mass rally attended by over 45,000 people was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on the 27th to welcome the Hungarian Government and Socialist Workers' Party delegation headed by Kádár.
    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and Kádár, spoke at the rally. In their speeches, they unanimously expressed their intention to strengthen the fraternal friendship between Romania and Hungary, and unanimously expressed their support for a series of peace initiatives proposed by the Soviet Union, Poland, China, and other countries.
    Gheorghiu-Dej said that the friendship between Romania and Hungary is growing stronger, which helps to consolidate the socialist camp. The talks between the two countries in Bucharest were conducted in the most friendly atmosphere and with complete agreement of opinions. The two governments fully support the Soviet proposal to hold a summit meeting and the Polish proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. We also welcome with great excitement the Chinese government's decision to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. The realization of these proposals and decisions will help to ensure peace.
    Kádár pointed out in his speech that the visit of the Hungarian Government and Party delegation is very important for strengthening the friendly relations between Hungary and Romania. Now our friendship with the Soviet Union, China, Romania, and other socialist camp countries is constantly being consolidated. We support any proposal that helps world peace and helps strengthen the solidarity of the socialist camp.
    On the evening of the 26th, Romanian Council of Ministers Chairman Stoica held a grand reception to entertain the Hungarian Government and Party delegation. More than a thousand people attended the reception, including Romanian state and party leaders, representatives from all walks of life in Bucharest, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Romania.
