    Lifelike Chicks
    When you see these lifelike chicks, you will surely think they were made by an excellent craftsman, but you would be wrong. They were originally made by a very famous Soviet architect. This architect's name is Markovsky, and many residences in the southwestern district of Moscow were built under his leadership. He loves nature and is also a good artist, so he often uses his spare time to collect acorns and palm fruits, and carve them into chicks and birds. These toys not only attract children, but even adults love them.

    栩栩如生的小鸡
    你看到这些栩栩如生的小鸡，一定会以为是一位优秀的手工艺人制成的，那你就错了。这原是出自苏联一位很有名的建筑师之手。这位建筑师名叫马尔科夫斯基，莫斯科市西南区的许多住宅，都是在他领导之下建筑的。他喜爱大自然，又是一位很好的艺术家，因而他时常利用闲暇时间采集橡实和棕果，用它们雕刻成小鸡和小鸟。这些玩具不仅吸引着孩子们，连成年人也很喜爱。
