Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Berlin Dispatch: West German Federal Assembly Deputy Speaker Schmid (Social Democratic Party) delivered a speech in West Berlin on the 27th, advocating that the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe be regarded as "the starting point for German reunification."

He made the remarks at a mass meeting commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Nazi arson attack on the German Reichstag in 1933. He opposed storing atomic weapons in West Germany. He said that if West Germany "participates in the atomic arms race, it would mean writing off the issue of German reunification."

Social Democratic Party member and former West German Interior Minister Heinemann, speaking at the University of Bonn on the 26th, urged the West German government to consider the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. He said he saw in the Polish government's proposal the possibility of "breaking free from a dead end."

"Neues Deutschland" published statistics from the West German Institute for Public Opinion Research on the 27th. According to the results of these institute surveys, 70% of West German residents support the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

    西德副议长赞成波兰倡议
    并反对在西德储存原子武器
    新华社28日讯　柏林消息：西德联邦议院副议长施密德（社会民主党）27日在西柏林发表演说，主张把波兰政府关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议看作“德国统一的起点”。
    他是在纪念1933年纳粹党徒在德国国会纵火事件二十五周年的群众大会上发表讲话的。他反对在西德储存原子武器。他说，如果西德“参加原子军备竞赛，这就意味着把德国统一问题一笔勾销”。
    社会民主党议员、前西德内政部长海?曼26日在波恩大学发表演说时要求西德政府考虑关于建立中欧无原子武器区的建议。他说，他在波兰政府的建议中看出了“摆脱死路”的可能性。
    “新德意志报”27日发表了西德民意研究所的统计数字，根据这些研究所调查的结果，西德70％的居民赞成建立中欧无原子武器区。
