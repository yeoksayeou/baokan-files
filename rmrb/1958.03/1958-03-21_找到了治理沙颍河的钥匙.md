During the Shaying River governance work symposium convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in December of last year, the meeting conscientiously summarized the typical examples of comprehensive governance in specific areas of the Shaying River basin in the past and drew on the experience of comprehensive governance of the Mang River. It also proposed the guiding principle of "emphasizing storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community-run projects" for governing the Shaying River. The specific requirements put forward at the Shaying River governance work symposium were as follows: to complete the initial governance of the basin within three years; to ensure that in mountainous and hilly areas, water does not flow down the mountains and soil is not lost in the event of rainfall up to 200 mm; to ensure on-site absorption and treatment in plains areas; and to ensure no outflow of water and water storage for irrigation in low-lying and flood-prone areas. Such governance can basically eliminate waterlogging disasters in the basin and basically achieve water conservancy throughout the entire basin. After the torrential rain is divided and treated, the flood season flow at the Zhoukou station in the middle reaches of the Shaying River will generally not exceed 2,500 cubic meters per second, and in the event of extraordinary floods, it will not exceed 3,000 cubic meters per second. This will ensure the safety of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the cities of Luohe and Zhoukou, and the vast areas on both banks of the Shaying River.

The Past of the Shaying River

The Shaying River is the largest tributary of the Huai River in terms of both river length and basin area. The Shaying River's main stream is 619 kilometers long, and the basin area is 39,880 square kilometers. The majority of the basin area is within the territory of the Xuchang Special Zone in Henan Province.

The Ying River originates from Shaobao Mountain in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, and flows southeast, passing through Yuxian County and Xiangcheng County, crossing the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway in Lin'ying County, passing through Xihua County to the west of Zhoukou City, where it first converges with the Sha River, then joins the Jialu River, and finally flows into the Huai River near Fuyang in Anhui Province with the Ci River and Quan River, entering the Huai River at Mohekou in Yingshang County. The Sha River originates from Yaoshan Mountain in the southwest of Lushan County, flows east to the southeast of Xiangcheng County, where it meets the North Ru River, passes through the northeast of Wuyang County and Yancheng County, crosses the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, passes through Luohe City, and joins the Ying River west of Zhoukou City.

The Shaying River basin, which has historically been severely affected by water and drought disasters, often affects nine counties in Henan and Anhui provinces when floods occur.

Since the beginning of the governance of the Huai River, many projects have been carried out on the Shaying River, a major tributary of the Huai River, such as dredging and reorganizing river channels, strengthening dikes, transforming low-lying areas, building the Baisha Reservoir on the Ying River, and constructing the Nihewa flood detention project between the Sha River and its tributary, the Li River. A large number of soil and water conservation projects and a large number of small reservoirs have been built in the upstream mountainous and hilly areas. This series of projects has reduced the water disasters of the Shaying River and has also initially developed water conservancy. For example, during the periods of extraordinarily large floods in the Sha River in 1956 and 1957, the Nihewa flood detention project timely stored and discharged floodwaters, ensuring the safety of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and the cities of Luohe and Zhoukou, as well as the vast areas on both banks of the river, downstream of Nihewa. After the completion of the Baisha Reservoir in 1952, the floods in the upper reaches of the Ying River were basically resolved. However, the Shaying River has many tributaries, and the floodwaters are large and fierce. There are no pivotal large-scale canyon reservoirs to control most of the basin area, and it would take a lot of money and a long time to build many large reservoirs on the main and tributaries to control the floods. For example, the Henan Provincial Department of Water Resources plans to build three reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 1.7 billion cubic meters on the Shaying River. These three reservoirs can only control one-quarter of the basin area and will take ten years to build. This is not suitable for the requirements of China's economic development.

Why Adopt the "Three Emphases" Policy

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the favorable conditions after collectivization and the existing experience in water management, decided to govern the Shaying River with the "three emphases" policy of emphasizing water storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community-run projects. According to the calculation of the average annual rainfall in the Shaying River basin, approximately 120,000 cubic meters of water are distributed per square kilometer, while an average of 80 cubic meters of water is distributed per mu of cultivated land, and even less in years with less water. If all the water for the whole year is stored, all the cultivated land can be watered three to four times a year. By doing this, two-thirds of the floods that occur once every ten years can be stored, which can basically eliminate flood disasters. Is this possible? Many advanced comprehensive governance models have proven that as long as the strength of the masses is fully utilized and various small-scale projects are widely carried out, it is entirely possible to achieve this.

In terms of soil and water conservation work in the mountainous and hilly areas in the upper reaches of the Shaying River, new progress has also been made since learning from Shanxi's experience in governing Daquanshan last spring. During the flood season last year, the completed projects not only withstood the test of floods for the most part but also basically achieved that water does not flow down the mountains and mud does not flow out of the gullies in the event of rainfall up to 200 mm. Yuxian County, downstream of the Baisha Reservoir, launched soil and water conservation projects in the first half of last year, building check dams, terraced field ridges, water baffles, interception ditches, fish scale pits, and other projects, controlling an area of more than 77 square kilometers. In addition to other agricultural technology improvement measures, last year it leaped from an old grain-deficient county to a surplus-grain county. In the mountainous areas of Jiaxian County in the upper reaches of the North Ru River, a tributary of the Sha River, 60 small reservoirs were built, storing more than 8.74 million cubic meters of water, which can irrigate 100,000 mu of land, of which 80,000 mu are drought-stricken land for many years. Because irrigation with stored water increased production by 70 jin per mu compared to land without irrigation, the 23,000 mu of farmland at the foot of the mountain also avoided the disasters of water erosion and sandy soil. Dengfeng County, the source of the Ying River, has major mountains such as Mount Song. Since the spring of 1956, 134 small reservoirs have been built, with a total investment of more than 800,000 yuan, of which the state invested only 100,000 yuan. The small reservoirs, plus canals, check dams, water storage ponds, and other projects, ensure that soil and water are not lost in the event of rainfall of 100 to 150 mm. The grain output in 1956 increased from 193 jin in 1952 to 360 jin.

In the downstream plains and low-lying, flood-prone areas, the policy of emphasizing water storage, emphasizing small-scale projects, and emphasizing community-run projects can also be implemented. Using methods such as digging ponds, ditches, building ridge fields, and surrounding fields, rainwater is divided and stored section by section, which can both avoid the concentration of rainwater and store water for irrigation, or change dry land to grow rice or flood-resistant crops. The Shaying River basin has also created very good examples in this regard. In the Daocaohu area north of the Sha River and south of the Zhu River in Yancheng County, ditches were vigorously dug, and control gates were built to store water; roadbeds were raised to divide rainwater; and runoff was controlled by intercepting and storing water section by section. Although heavy rain was encountered last year, the wheat fields did not accumulate water and cause disasters, and the wheat yield increased from 115 jin per mu in 1955 to 146 jin.

In the near future, the natural landscape of the entire Shaying River basin will be fundamentally changed, and the days when the people along the river were subjected to alternating attacks of water and drought disasters will also come to an end.

    找到了治理沙颍河的钥匙
    新华社记者　君谦
    去年12月间，中共河南省委召开的沙颍河治理工作座谈会上，认真总结了过去沙颍河流域个别地区全面治理的典型总结，并吸取全面治理漭河的经验，提出了“以蓄为主，以小型为主，以社办为主”的治理沙颍河的方针。沙颍河治理工作座谈会上提出的具体要求是这样的：在三年内完成流域内的初步治理，在一次下雨二百公厘的情况下，在山区和丘陵区做到水不下山，土不流失；在平原地区，做到就地吸收处理，在低洼易涝地区，做到水不外流，并蓄水灌溉。这样的治理可以使流域内基本上消灭水、涝灾害，基本上达到全流域水利化。暴雨被分割处理后，使沙颍河中游周口站的汛期流量，一般不超过二千五百秒公方，特大洪水时，不超过三千秒公方。这样就可以保障京广铁路和漯河、周口两市及沙河两岸广大地区的安全。
    沙颍河的过去
    沙颍河在淮河支流中，河道长度和流域面积都属第一。沙颍河干流长六百一十九公里，流域面积三万九千八百八十平方公里。流域面积绝大部分在河南省许昌专区境内。
    颍河发源于河南省登封县少宝山，往东南行，经禹县、襄城到临颍县横穿京广铁路，经西华到周口市西，先会沙河，再与贾鲁河汇流，到安徽省的阜阳附近和茨河、泉河汇流，到颍上县的沫河口流入淮河。沙河源出鲁山县西南的尧山，东流到襄城县东南会北汝河，经舞阳县东北和郾城，穿过京广铁路，经漯河市到周口市西汇入颍河。
    历来水旱灾害严重的沙颍河流域，在发生洪水灾害时，常波及河南、安徽两省的九个县。
    开始治理淮河以来，在淮河大支流的沙颍河上，已经做了许多工程，如疏浚整理河道，加强堤防，洼地改造，在颍河上建成了白沙水库，在沙河及其支流澧河之间筑成了泥河洼滞洪工程，上游山区和丘陵区做了大量的保持水土的工程，和大批小水库。这一系列的工程，减轻了沙颍河的水灾，也初步开发了水利。如1956年和1957年，沙河连续出现特大洪水时期，由于有泥河洼滞洪工程及时蓄泄洪水，保障了泥河洼以下京广铁路和漯河市、周口市及两岸广大地区的安全。1952年建成白沙水库以后，颍河上游的洪水基本上解决了。但沙颍河支流多，洪水量大势猛，却没有控制大部流域面积的枢纽性的巨型峡谷水库，要在干、支流上，花很多的钱，用很长的时间，兴建许多大型水库才能控制住洪水。如河南省水利厅计划在沙颍河上建筑总库容十七亿公方的三座水库。这三座水库只能控制流域面积的四分之一，要十年才能建成。这是不适合我国经济发展的要求的。
    为什么要采取“三主”方针
    中共河南省委根据合作化后的有利条件和已有的治水经验，决定以蓄水为主、以小型为主、以社办为主的“三主”方针来治理沙颍河。根据沙颍河流域的多年平均雨量计算，每平方公里的雨量大约分担十二万方水，而一亩耕地平均八十方水，少水年还不到这个数目。如把全年水量都蓄起来，全部耕地一年能给三次到四次水。这样作，就能把十年一遇的洪水的三分之二都蓄起来，基本上可以消除洪水灾害。这样是否有可能？许多先进的全面治理的典型都证明：只要充分发挥群众的力量，广泛搞各种小型工程，完全能够作到。
    在沙颍河上游山区和丘陵区的水土保持工作方面，自去年春季学习了山西治理大泉山的经验后，也有了新的进展。去年汛期，已完成的工程，绝大部分不仅经受了洪水考验，并且基本上达到在一次降雨二百公厘的情况下，水不下山，泥不出沟。白沙水库下游的禹县，去年上半年开展水土保持工程，做了谷坊、梯田埂、水簸箕、截水沟、鱼鳞坑等工程，控制面积七十七平方公里多，加上其它农业技术改良措施，去年就由老缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。沙河支流北汝河上游的郏县的山区里，建筑了六十座小水库，蓄水八百七十四万多公方，可浇地十万亩，其中八万亩是多年的干旱地，因为蓄水灌溉比不浇水的地每亩增产七十斤；山下二万三千亩耕田也避免了水冲沙质的灾害。颍河发源地的登封县，境内有中岳嵩山等大山，从1956年春以来，建成了一百三十四座小水库，共投资八十万多元，其中国家投资只有十万元。小水库加上渠道、谷坊、水囤等工程，做到在一次降雨一百到一百五十公厘的情况下水土不流失，1956年的粮食产量由1952年的一百九十三斤提高到三百六十斤。
    在下游平原和低洼易涝地区，同样可以贯彻以蓄水为主、小型为主、社办为主的方针。利用挖坑塘、壕沟、筑畦田、围田等方法，分割雨水，节节拦蓄，既能避免雨水集中，也能蓄水灌溉，或将旱田改种水稻、改种耐涝作物。沙颍河流域在这方面也创造了很好范例。郾城县沙河以北，渚河以南的稻草湖一带，大力挖沟，建筑节制闸蓄水；抬高路基分割雨水；节节拦蓄，控制径流。去年虽遇暴雨，麦田没有积水成灾，小麦由1955年的亩产一百一十五斤，提高到一百四十六斤。
    在不久的将来，就会使整个沙颍河流域的自然面貌根本改观，沿河人民长期受水灾和旱灾交错袭击的日子也将结束。
