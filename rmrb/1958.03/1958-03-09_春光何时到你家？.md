When Will Spring Arrive at Your Home?
		Chun Yang
Winter departs and spring arrives; who isn't delighted by the bright spring scenery? Spring always comes to your side when people aren't even aware of it. If someone earnestly asks others, "When will spring arrive at your home?" perhaps the answers they receive will be varied.
“The Start of Spring (立春) is the beginning of spring,” many people will say. But astronomers immediately retort: “No, spring begins after the Spring Equinox (春分).” Meteorologists, upon hearing this, will shake their heads and say: “I don't agree with either of you; March, April, and May are the spring season each year.” Some housewives will doubtfully say, “Isn’t it spring from the Spring Festival (春节) onwards?”
“The Start of Spring” is on February 4th each year. At this time, flowers are already blooming in the south, while the north is still experiencing heavy snow; the “Spring Equinox” is on March 21st, about one and a half months later than the Start of Spring. Although the weather in the Yangtze River basin is already mild and warm, the northeast is still bitterly cold. As for the “Spring Festival,” it is merely a holiday, and the climate change between north and south falls between the above two solar terms. Can we call these two drastically different weather conditions both the spring season? The fragrant birds and blooming flowers of the south are certainly wonderful spring scenery, but how can the whistling north wind and fluttering snowflakes of the north be called spring? For our country, which has complex terrain and a vast area, the beginning of spring cannot be mechanically fixed to the same period.
To know when spring will arrive at your home, there is a reliable method, which is to determine it based on the actual observed temperature changes in various regions. In the past, the Chinese people defined five days as one "hou (候)," and if the average temperature of each hou (i.e., the five-day average temperature) is between 10 and 22 degrees Celsius, it is spring (or autumn); above 22 degrees Celsius is summer, and below 10 degrees Celsius is winter. In this way, no matter whether your home is in the southwest where it is like spring all year round; or the northwest where it is variably warm and cold; even in Tibet with its high altitude and cold climate; or the northeast with its little heat and much cold, as long as you use this "yardstick" to measure, it is not difficult to know when spring will descend on your doorstep.
Some people cannot help but ask: "Why use this 'yardstick'?" This is because in actual life, such a temperature is most suitable for good health; in the production process and changes in nature, this temperature is also suitable for plant growth and cultivation. Isn't the temperature of 10 to 22 degrees Celsius neither cold nor hot, but a great time for the germination of all things? Isn't the spring you are looking forward to exactly this kind of weather?
Using this "yardstick" to measure in our country, we know that only in the area south of the Pearl River can spring descend with the "Start of Spring." Moving northward from here, spring is delayed by about two and a half days for every hundred kilometers. In the Fujian and Zhejiang areas, spring colors appear only in late February. In the Yangtze River basin, the upstream area sees spring at the beginning of March, the midstream in mid-March, and the downstream at the end of March, before the land begins to return to spring. In the Yellow River basin and the Beijing-Tianjin area, people can only meet the spring breeze in early April. In Xinjiang and on the border of Heilongjiang, it is not until the "Start of Summer (立夏)" in early May that people can bask in the warm spring sun. You see, from the southernmost to the northernmost point, the beginning of spring differs by as much as three months! If we summarize the whole country, only in April can various places see the bright spring scenery one after another. However, when the people of the northeast begin to cultivate and fertilize in the mild and sunny spring, the masses in the Pearl River basin are already harvesting in the scorching summer heat, which shows how vast and broad our motherland is!

    春光何时到你家？
    春阳
    冬去春来，谁不为明媚的春光而喜悦？春，老是那么在人们还没觉察的时候就来到了你的身边。谁要认真地向别人问起：“春光何时到你家？”也许他所得到的回答会是各种各样的。
    “立春就是春天的开始”，许多人都会这样说。而天文学家立刻反驳道：“不，春分以后才是春天。”气象学者听了郤摇摇头，说道：“你们说的我都不赞成，每年三、四、五月才是春季。”有些家庭主妇就会怀疑地说：“不是从春节起就是春天了吗？”
    “立春”在每年2月4日，这时，南方已百花盛开，而北方仍是大雪纷纷；“春分”在3月21日，比立春晚了约一个半月，长江流域虽已风和日暖，而东北却仍是寒气逼人。至于“春节”，仅是一个节日，南北气候的变化介于上述两个节气之间。难道能把这两种截然不同的天气，同时都叫作春季吗？鸟语花香，百花争艳的南方，固然是大好春光，而朔风凛冽，雪花飘飘的北方，又怎能叫作春天呢？对于地形复杂，面积辽阔的我国来说，春季的开始，就不能机械地固定在同一个时期。
    要知道春光何时到你家，有一个可靠的办法，这办法就是根据各地实际观测的气温变化来决定。我国人民过去曾定五天为一“候”，每候的平均温度（即五日均温），如果是在摄氏10度—22度之间便是春季（或秋季），高于22度是夏季，低于十度是冬季。这样，不管你家住在四时如春的西南；或者是寒暖多变的西北；那怕在地高天寒的西藏；还是多冷少热的东北，只要拿着这个“尺”子去衡量，就不难知道春天何时才能降临到你的家门。
    有人不免要问：“为什么要用这个‘尺’子呢？”这是因为在实际生活中，这样的温度对身体健康最合适；在生产过程和自然界的变化中，这种温度也正适于植物的生长和耕作。摄氏10度到22度的气温，不正是不冷不热，万物萌生的大好时光吗？您所盼望的春天，不正是这样的天气吗？
    用这个“尺”子在我国测量的结果，我们知道了只有在珠江以南的地区，春光才能随着“立春”而降临。由此向北，每前进一百公里，春天就要迟到约两天半的时间。闽、浙地区到2月下旬才见春色。长江流域，上游在3月初，中游在3月中，下游在3月底，大地方始回春。黄河流域以及京、津一带，4月初才能和春风相遇。在新疆和黑龙江边，要到5月初的“立夏”，才能晒着春天的温暖的太阳。你看：从最南到极北，春季的开始竟相差达三个月之久！若概括全国而言，只有到了4月，各地才能先后见到明媚的春光。可是，当东北人民开始在风和日丽的春天耕作施肥的时候，而珠江流域的群众，却又在赤热炎炎的夏季进行收获了，可见我们祖国的幅员是多么辽阔广大啊！
