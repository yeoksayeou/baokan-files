    What kind of person is George Meany?
    Question: The "People's Daily" published George Meany's speech on the American economic situation on March 22. What kind of person is he?
    Answer: George Meany is the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and is sixty-three years old. He used to be a construction worker and has been involved in trade union work for more than 30 years. The "Dictionary of Names" compiled by American bourgeois scholars calls him a "labor official." He entered the upper leadership of the American trade union in the 1920s. He served as the chairman of the New York State Federation of Labor from 1934 to 1939, and as a member of the "National Wartime Labor Committee" of the United States from 1940 to 1942. In 1952, he rose from the treasurer of the AFL to the chairman of the AFL. After the merger of the AFL and the CIO in December 1955, he has been the chairman of the "AFL-CIO".
    On the one hand, Meany flaunts that the trade union safeguards the interests of workers and demands to ensure employment and increase wages; on the other hand, he promotes reformist ideas and advocates "cooperation between trade unions and capitalists." At the same time, he spares no effort in carrying out anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities and supports the US government's policy of expanding its military and preparing for war. Obviously, Meany's proposition does not conform to the true interests of American trade union members.

### 乔治·米尼是怎样一个人？

    乔治·米尼是怎样一个人？
    问：3月22日“人民日报”发表了乔治·米尼关于美国经济状况的演说。他是怎样一个人呢？
    答：乔治·米尼是美国“劳联—产联”主席，现年六十三岁。他曾当过建筑工人，从事工会工作已三十多年。美国资产阶级学者编的“人名辞典”称他为“劳工官”。从本世纪二十年代起，他便步入美国工会上层领导机构。曾在1934—1939年间，任纽约州劳联主席，1940—1942年任美国“全国战时劳工委员会”委员。1952年，他由劳联司库上升为劳联主席。1955年12月，劳联和产联合并后，一直担任着“劳联—产联”的主席。
    米尼一方面标榜工会维护工人的利益，要求保障就业和增加工资；另一方面鼓吹改良主义思想，主张“工会和资本家合作”。同时，他也不遗余力地进行反苏反共的活动，并支持美国政府的扩军备战政策。显然，米尼的这种主张是不符合美国工会会员的真正利益的。
