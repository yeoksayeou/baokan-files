    Highway Connecting Guizhou and Guangxi
    The Ce(heng)-San(jiang) highway, connecting Guizhou and Guangxi provinces, has recently begun construction in batches.
    The Ce-San highway starts from Ceheng County in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and ends in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Guangxi Province. It is 740 kilometers long. This year, the construction of 160 kilometers between Dushan and Luodian will be completed. The entire project is expected to be completed in 1960.
    The areas through which this highway passes are mostly inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the Buyi, Miao, and Dong.

    贯通贵州广西的公路
    贯通贵州和广西两省的册（亨）三（江）公路，已在最近分批陆续动工修筑。
    册三公路起于黔南布依族苗族自治州境内的册亨县，直到广西省的三江侗族自治县。全长有七百四十公里。今年将完成独山到罗甸之间的一百六十公里的修建工程。全线工程预计要在1960年完成。
    这条公路通过的地区绝大部分是布依、苗、侗等少数民族聚居区。
