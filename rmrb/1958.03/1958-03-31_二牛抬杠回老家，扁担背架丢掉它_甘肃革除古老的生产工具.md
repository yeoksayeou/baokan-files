Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: The production tool with a history of more than 1,500 years in Gansu Province, the "two oxen lifting a pole," is gradually being replaced by new-style farm implements. Dozens of counties and cities throughout the province have proposed that they will achieve new-style walking plows this year.

The "two oxen lifting a pole" is a heavy plow with a "T"-shaped beam. When plowing, two oxen horizontally lift the front wooden pole and move forward. This kind of plow is depicted in the Northern Wei Dynasty murals in the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang and has been used until now. Currently, in the upsurge of agricultural technology reform that has been universally launched, the masses in various places have put forward the slogan "Two oxen lifting a pole return to their hometown, discard the carrying pole and backpack frame." Originally, the province planned to promote more than 260,000 new-style animal-powered farm implements, mainly new-style walking plows, this year, but the number requested by various places has greatly exceeded this. The "two oxen lifting a pole" in Dunhuang County disappeared in early March, and the county achieved walking plow implementation. The masses in Jiezixiang Township in Tianshui County raised funds and materials and concentrated carpenters and blacksmiths to abolish old plows and achieve new-style walking plow implementation in one day. They also achieved vehicularization within ten days. After the Tianshui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promoted the experience of this township throughout the county, by March 7, a total of more than 22,000 new-style walking plows had been promoted in the county, and new-style walking plow implementation was quickly achieved.

Due to the elimination of old plows and the popularization of new-style walking plows, the appearance of these counties has been completely renewed in this year's spring plowing production.

    “二牛抬杠回老家，扁担背架丢掉它”
    甘肃革除古老的生产工具
    新华社兰州讯　甘肃有一千五百多年历史的生产工具——“二牛抬杠”，正逐步被新式农具所代替。全省有几十个县市已经提出今年就要实现新式步犁化。
    “二牛抬杠”是一种犁辕成“T”字形的笨重耕犁，耕地时两头牛横抬着前面的木杠前进。在敦煌千佛洞北魏时代的壁画中，就画有这种耕犁，一直沿用到现在。目前，在普遍掀起的农业技术改革高潮中，各地群众提出了“二牛抬杠回老家，扁担背架丢掉它”的口号。原来全省今年计划推广以新式步犁为主的各种新式畜力农具二十六万多部，现在各地所要求供应的数字已经大大超过。敦煌县的“二牛抬杠”在3月上旬已经绝迹，全县实现了步犁化。天水县街子乡群众集资、集料，集中木匠、铁匠，一天内就废除旧犁，实现了新式步犁化，并且在十天内实现车辆化。中共天水县委在全县推广这个乡的经验以后，到3月7日全县共推广新式步犁二万二千多部，也很快实现了新式步犁化。
    由于旧犁革除，新式步犁普及，这些县在今年春耕生产中面貌已焕然一新。
