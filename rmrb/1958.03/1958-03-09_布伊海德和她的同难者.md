Bouhired and Her Fellow Sufferers

Five Algerian women were sentenced to death by the French colonial authorities. They are: Djamila Bouhired, Jacqueline Gueroutj, Baya Hocine, Djamila Bouazza, and Djeher Akrou.

Djamila Bouhired, this kind and brave girl, is already familiar to us. The French government had announced that it would execute her on March 7. Under the pressure of strong world public opinion, the French government had to stop carrying out her death sentence.

Sharing the same cell with Bouhired is Jacqueline Gueroutj. She was born in France and studied law and philosophy at university. In 1942, she was arrested by the Hitler gang and, after many dangers, finally escaped the clutches of the enemy. After the war, she taught in Algeria. Because of her love for her disaster-stricken motherland, she participated in the Algerian people's struggle for freedom. She said in the French colonialists' court: "What I hate most in the world is war, but I cannot but fight." She and her husband are both communists. Therefore, the French colonialists decided to sentence her to death and even threw her eldest daughter, Danielle, into prison.

Djamila Bouazza, this unfortunate girl, has been tortured to the point of madness and is very ill. The French authorities not only did not treat her, but also wanted to force her to be a "witness" to convict Bouhired. However, their plan failed, so they decided to sentence her to death as well.

Baya Hocine and Djeher Akrou are eighteen and seventeen years old, respectively. In Arabic, "Baya" means "beauty," and "Djeher" means "pearl." Djeher once wanted to be a nurse or study more. However, poverty forced her to give up her studies and become a temporary worker. Later, this "pearl" joined the ranks of fighting for the liberation of Algeria. Baya's sister is an active member of the Algerian trade union movement. After her sister was arrested and imprisoned, she began to participate in the struggle at the age of sixteen.

At the end of last year, the French colonialists' court once considered Baya and Djeher to be "juvenile offenders." But this was not recorded in the interrogation record. The court finally sentenced these two girls to death. What crime did these five outstanding Algerian women commit? Their crime is that they fought for the happiness and freedom of the people!

    布伊海德和她的同难者
    有五个阿尔及利亚妇女被法国殖民当局判处了死刑。她们是：加米拉·布伊海德，热克林·盖鲁特日，巴依阿·荷香，加米拉·布阿萨和德热赫尔·阿克鲁。
    加米拉·布伊海德，这个善良而又勇敢的姑娘，是我们早已熟悉的了。法国政府曾宣布要在3月7日把她处死。在强大的世界舆论的压力下，法国政府才不得不停止执行对她的死刑。
    同布伊海德住在同一间牢房里的是热克林·盖鲁特日。她生在法国，在大学里学法律和哲学。1942年曾被希特勒匪帮逮捕，历经险阻，终于逃脱了敌人的魔掌。战后她在阿尔及利亚任教。由于热爱多灾多难的祖国，她参加了阿尔及利亚人民争取自由的斗争。她在法国殖民主义者的法庭上说：“在世界上我最憎恶的是战争，但是我又不能不去战斗。”她和她的丈夫都是共产党员。因此，法国殖民者就决定把她判处死刑，甚至把她的大女儿丹尼文尔也抓进了监狱。
    加米拉·布阿萨这个不幸的姑娘已经被折磨得发了疯，并且病得很沉重。法国当局非但没有为她医治，反而想逼她当对布伊海德定罪的“人证”。但是，他们的打算落了空，因此决定也把她判处死刑。
    巴依阿·荷香和德热赫尔·阿克鲁两人，一个十八岁，一个十七岁。在阿拉伯文中“巴依阿”的意思是“美女”，“德热赫尔”的意思是“珍珠”。德热赫尔曾经想做一个护士，或是去念点书。可是，贫穷使她不得不放弃学习而去做短工。后来这颗“珍珠”就参加了为解放阿尔及利亚而斗争的行列。巴依阿的姐姐是阿尔及利亚工会运动的一个积极分子。当她的姐姐被捕入狱以后，她从十六岁就开始参加了斗争。
    去年年底，法国殖民主义者的法庭曾一度认为巴依阿和德热赫尔是“未成年犯”。但是在审讯笔录中没有记下这一点。法院最后仍然把这两个姑娘判处了死刑。阿尔及利亚这五位卓越妇女有什么罪呢？她们之所以有罪就是因为她们为人民的幸福和自由而斗争！（樵）（附图片）
