To help Qingdao residents understand the hygiene work situation in Lüda and learn from their advanced experiences, the Qingdao Daily editorial department and the Lüda Daily editorial department agreed to exchange manuscripts about hygiene work and experiences. On March 26th, a special page titled "Learn from Lüda's Experience, Achieve Six Cleans and Six No's" appeared in the Qingdao Daily. This special page reported on the heroic deeds of the people of Lüda on the hygiene front, introduced the rat extermination experience of Dalian Port, the experience of the Quanyong Street Third Residents' Committee in improving the hygiene of eating utensils, and the hygiene work experience of Dalianwan Township in the suburbs. The manuscripts and photos in the special page were all provided by the Lüda Daily.

    "Great Enthusiasm for Greening, Beautiful Long-Term Prospects, Putuo District Will Become Grape District" was the headline of a Shanghai Xinmin Evening News news item on the 25th.

        Ducks in flocks, fish filling the ponds,
        Fresh fruit in all seasons, sweet and fragrant,
        Millions of bees flitting through the flowers,
        Groups of girls busily picking fruit…
    Nearly 400 mu of land has now been opened up for orchards, including Caoyang Grape Garden, Gongqing Orchard, and "March 8th" Orchard.
    Shanxi Promotes "Determining Work by Output"
    The Shanxi Daily reported on the 27th that the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued an important notice requiring the province to promote the "Determining Work by Output" system in all communes before spring plowing. "Determining Work by Output" is to calculate remuneration according to the value created by the amount of labor consumed. It can more reasonably realize the principle of distribution according to work and is a good way to improve the management level of cooperatives. According to reports, 150 agricultural cooperatives in Qi County have done "Determining Work by Output" quickly and well. The newspaper also published an editorial calling on agricultural cooperatives throughout the province to learn from Qi County and adopt methods of decentralized instruction or intensive training to teach the significance and practice of "Determining Work by Output" to cooperative cadres.
    Handing Over "Double-Anti" Spoils of War
    On the 26th, staff from the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture carried a letter of determination and a "first batch of spoils of war list," handing over accumulated materials worth more than 70,000 yuan, unearthed in the "Double-Anti" movement, to the Provincial People's Committee. Among them were electric single-girder bridge cranes, vulcanized cutting oil, rubber, and other materials that many construction departments urgently needed but could not buy. While handing over this batch of spoils, they also proposed to all fraternal departments and bureaus: thoroughly check warehouse materials, handle accumulated and improperly used materials quickly and well, and report the accumulated materials to the Provincial People's Committee without reservation. The Dazhong Daily published this report on the 28th and wrote a short commentary praising their practice.

    在各地报纸上
    有意义的专页
    2月间，旅大市向青岛市提出了除四害、讲卫生的竞赛倡议。青岛市已经应战。为了帮助青岛居民了解旅大市的卫生工作状况，学习他们的先进经验，青岛日报编辑部和旅大日报编辑部约定，互相交换关于卫生工作情况和经验的稿件。3月26日，在青岛日报上出现了一个“学习旅大经验，实现六洁六无”的专页。这个专页报道了旅大市人民在卫生战线上的英勇事迹，介绍了大连港的灭鼠经验、泉涌街第三居民委员会搞好食具卫生的经验和郊区大连湾乡的卫生工作经验。专页中的稿件和照片，都是旅大日报供给的。
    普陀区——葡萄区
    “绿化劲头大、远景美煞人，普陀区将成为葡萄区”，这是25日上海新民报晚刊头条消息的标题。消息中说，普陀区在基本上实现今年植树三百万株的基础上，将大力发展种水果。他们的五至十年远景规划，描绘出这样一幅画一般的美景：
        普陀区——葡萄区，
        绿树成荫果满枝，
        鸭儿成群鱼满塘，
        四时鲜果甜又香，
        千百万蜂儿穿花蕊，
        成群的姑娘采果忙……
    现在已经开辟近四百多亩土地的果园了，其中有曹杨葡萄园、共青果园、“三八”果园等。
    山西推行“以产定工”
    27日的山西日报报道，中共山西省委发出了一个重要通知，要求全省在春耕前社社推行“以产定工”制。“以产定工”是按照消耗的劳动量所创造的价值来计算报酬的。它能够比较合理地实现按劳取酬原则，是一种提高合作社经营管理水平的好办法。据报道祁县的一百五十个农业社，“以产定工”工作作得又快又好，报纸并发表社论号召全省农业社学习祁县，采取分片传授或集训办法，把“以产定工”的意义和做法教给合作社干部。
    上缴“双反”战利品
    26日，山东省农业厅工作人员抬着决心书和“首批战利品清单”，向省人民委员会上缴“双反”运动中清查出来的积压物资，价值七万多元。其中如电动单杆桥式起重机、硫化切削油、橡胶等，是许多建设部门急需而买不到的。他们在上缴这批战利品的同时，还向各兄弟厅、局提出倡议：彻底清查仓库物资，对积压和利用不当的物资要处理得快、处理得好，并把积压的物资毫无保留地上报省人民委员会。大众日报28日发表了这一报道，并写了短评表扬他们的做法。
