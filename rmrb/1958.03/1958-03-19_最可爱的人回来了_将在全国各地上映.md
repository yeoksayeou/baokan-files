To Be Screened Across the Country

    The film "The Most Beloved People Have Returned," which records the grand occasion of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops returning home in triumph, premiered for audiences in the capital on the 18th and will be screened across the country.
    The film records the scene of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, who were guarding the military demarcation line, explaining the defense tasks in detail to the Korean People's Army soldiers who came to take over. The film captured the scene of Premier Kim Il-sung and Korean Party and government leaders taking a special car to the Volunteer Army headquarters to bid farewell to the generals, officers, and soldiers of the first group of Volunteer Army troops who were about to withdraw from Korea, and laying wreaths at the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery.
