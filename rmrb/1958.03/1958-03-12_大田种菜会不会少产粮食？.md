　　People are worried that planting vegetables in large fields will squeeze out grain production. However, according to an investigation in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, one of the main producing areas of Chinese cabbage: as long as we find ways to improve land utilization based on local conditions and adopt the method of three-crop rotation of potatoes, corn, and Chinese cabbage, planting vegetables will not only not affect the grain sowing area, but also increase grain production, develop pig raising, increase fertilizer, and increase farmers' income.

　　In Fengrun County, the three-crop rotation has become a habit. The method is to sow potatoes five or six days before the Qingming Festival; interplant corn in the potato fields during the Xiaoman solar term; harvest potatoes five or six days before the Xiaoshu solar term; sow Chinese cabbage (seedlings) three or four days before the beginning of Autumn; transplant them to the cornfields during the Chushu solar term; harvest corn seven or eight days after the Chushu solar term, and harvest cabbage at the beginning of Winter. Generally, the yield per mu is 2,400 jin of potatoes, equivalent to 600 jin of grain; 250 jin of corn, and 9,000 jin of Chinese cabbage; which is about 50% higher than the general grain yield in the fields. In areas with high yield per unit area, each mu can harvest 3,000 jin of potatoes, equivalent to 750 jin of grain, 350 jin of corn, and 15,000 jin of Chinese cabbage; the yield per mu exceeds 1,000 jin of grain and 10,000 jin of vegetables.

　　The net agricultural income from three-crop rotation is two to four times higher than the income from ordinary grain fields. The net income per mu from intercropping corn and soybeans in Wanglanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative is 16 yuan and 43 cents, while the net income from potato intercropping reaches 58 yuan and 60 cents. In 1957, the area of intercropped Chinese cabbage in Henggu Agricultural Cooperative accounted for one-sixth of the cooperative's total land. According to the autumn harvest settlement, each labor day earned 1 yuan and 4 cents (the value of work points was affected by the reduced cotton production due to disasters), of which the income from intercropped Chinese cabbage accounted for about one-quarter. If Chinese cabbage was not intercropped, an average laborer would earn 60 yuan less per year, equivalent to 816 jin of corn, enough for two people to eat for a year.

　　Planting vegetables can not only increase farmers' income, but also increase the accumulation of agricultural cooperatives. The public reserve fund and public welfare fund extracted from the income of Chinese cabbage in Henggu Agricultural Cooperative is more than 4,000 yuan, accounting for one-quarter of the total accumulation, which can buy 29 oxen or 12 carts. The masses reflect: "The cabbage harvest is as good as an autumn harvest." Although the population is dense and the land is scarce in several main vegetable producing areas of Fengrun County, averaging about one mu per person, the living standards of the farmers are higher than in other areas due to the adoption of intercropping methods to increase the multiple cropping index.

　　Small potatoes and cabbage leaves that do not meet commodity standards can also be used as feed to develop pig raising and accumulate fertilizer. This can both save grain and increase grain production. In the past, farmers threw away cabbage leaves to make fertilizer, but last year they were generally used as feed. Henggu Cooperative produced 9.1 million jin of Chinese cabbage in 1957. About 3.6 million jin were sorted from raw cabbage and detached from storage, which can be dried into 300,000 jin of dried cabbage noodles, which can feed 205 pigs throughout the year. Each pig can produce 6,000 jin of manure, which can fertilize two mu of land, totaling 410 mu of land.

　　According to the experience of local farmers, the development of three-crop rotation requires certain water conservancy conditions to irrigate potatoes and Chinese cabbage. Secondly, it is necessary to increase the application of fertilizer to promote the timely development and growth of crops and harvest them on schedule. We must also pay attention to field management and intensive cultivation to avoid affecting yields.

    大田种菜会不会少产粮食？
    董家珍
    人们担心在大田种菜会挤掉粮食。但是，据在河北省大白菜主要产地之一的丰润县调查：只要根据当地具体条件设法提高土地使用率，采用马铃薯、玉米、大白菜三荏套作的办法，种菜不但不影响粮食播种面积，而且还能增加粮食产量，发展养猪事业，增加肥料，增加农民收入。
    丰润县采用三荏套种已成为习惯了。方法是清明节前五、六天播种马铃薯；小满节在马铃薯地里套种玉米；小暑前五、六天收获马铃薯；立秋前三、四天播种大白菜（育苗），处暑移栽于玉米地中；处暑后七、八天收获玉米，立冬砍菜。一般亩产马铃薯二千四百斤，折粮六百斤；玉米二百五十斤，大白菜九千斤；高于一般大田粮食产量50％左右。单位面积产量高的，每亩能收马铃薯三千斤，折粮七百五十斤，玉米三百五十斤，大白菜一万五千斤；亩产超过千斤粮万斤菜。
    三荏套作，农业纯收入高于一般粮田收益二至四倍。王兰庄农业社玉米、大豆间作每亩纯收入十六元四角三分，马铃薯套作纯收益达五十八元六角。横沽农业社1957年套种大白菜面积占全社土地六分之一。秋收决算每个劳动日得一元零四分（因棉花受灾减产工分值受影响），其中套种大白菜收入约占四分之一。如不套种大白菜，一个中等劳动力全年就要少收入六十元，折合玉米八百十六斤，够两个人吃一年。
    种菜不仅能增加农民收入，也能增加农业社的积累。横沽农业社从大白菜的收入中提取的公积金和公益金即在四千元以上，占全部积累的四分之一，可买耕牛二十九头或大车十二辆。群众反映：“白菜收，顶一秋”。丰润县几个主要产菜区虽然人口稠密，土地较少，平均每人一市亩左右。但因采用套作办法提高复种率，农民的生活水平都高于其它地区。
    一些不够商品条件的小个马铃薯和白菜帮子，还可以用作饲料，发展养猪积肥。这既能节约粮食，又能提高粮食产量。过去农民把白菜帮子扔掉沤肥，去年普遍都充做饲料。横沽社1957年产大白菜九百一十万斤。整理毛菜及储存脱帮的约三百六十万斤，可以晒成干白菜面三十万斤，全年可喂猪二百零五头。每头猪能出圈肥六千斤，可以肥田二亩，共能肥田四百一十亩。
    根据当地农民经验，发展三荏套作要具备一定的水利条件，以便给马铃薯和大白菜灌溉。其次是增施肥料，促使作物及时发育生长，按期收获。还要注意田间管理精耕细作，以免影响产量。
