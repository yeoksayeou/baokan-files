Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch: Taking advantage of the warm spring weather when mosquitoes are thriving, the people of Guangzhou are working day and night to concentrate on destroying mosquito breeding grounds and are fully repairing canals in the city.

For the past twenty-odd days, groups of people repairing canals have been seen everywhere in the streets and alleys of the urban area. They have been digging up the large stone slabs of the streets, clearing out the sludge and foul water that has accumulated in the canals for many years, reinstalling tile pipes, and converting the open canals that have long bred mosquitoes into covered canals, leaving the mosquito larvae with nowhere to live. Many street residents, in order to repair the canals before the spring rains arrive, have been working in shifts day and night in a concentrated effort. Some streets have temporarily organized childcare groups so that women burdened with children can free themselves to participate in canal repair work.

Currently, the citizens' enthusiasm for renovating ditches and canals is very high. They are raising funds themselves and doing the repairs themselves. In just a few days, the masses have already raised more than 100,000 yuan for canal repairs.

    集中摧毁蚊虫孳生地
    广州人民全力整修渠道
    据新华社广州电　趁着春暖蚊虫盛发的时候，广州市人民正在不分昼夜地集中摧毁蚊虫的孳生基地，全力整修市内街渠道。
    最近二十多天，市区的大街小巷到处是一群群整修渠道的人们。他们把街道的大石板挖开来，清理出渠内多年淤积下来的污泥臭水，重新装上瓦筒，并将原来长期孳生蚊虫的明渠改为暗渠，使蚊子的幼虫无地栖身。许多街道居民为了赶着在春雨到来之前修好渠道，日夜轮番地突击劳动。有些街道临时组织了托儿组，让有孩子拖累的妇女能抽身参加修渠工作。
    现在，市民整治沟渠的情绪很高，他们自己筹集资金，自己动手整修。在短短的几天中，群众就已筹到整修渠道的资金十多万元。
