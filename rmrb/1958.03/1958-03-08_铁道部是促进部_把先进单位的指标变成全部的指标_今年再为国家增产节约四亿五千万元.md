The Ministry of Railways is a Promotion Department
Turning the Indicators of Advanced Units into the Indicators of All
This Year, Increase Production and Practice Economy by Another 450 Million Yuan for the Country
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Reporter Wang Liang reports: In the rectification movement and the current anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the national railways are showing a vibrant and vigorous scene. A mass upsurge of comprehensive great leaps forward is taking shape. On this basis, the Ministry of Railways has proposed a plan to increase production and practice economy by another 450 million yuan for the country this year.
    Bo Yibo, Director of the State Economic Commission, recently convened a special meeting of the Party secretaries of the industrial, transportation, financial and economic, agricultural and forestry, and water conservancy departments under the State Council to listen to the Ministry of Railways' report on increasing production and practicing economy. Bo Yibo believes that the Ministry of Railways' approach is very good, and the Economic Commission will provide support in all aspects. He asked all departments to quickly formulate their own plans for increasing production and practicing economy.
    In order to accelerate the speed of railway construction and meet the needs of the great leap forward in the national economy, the State Economic Commission has approved the Ministry of Railways to re-use the 206 million yuan of funds saved from this year's capital construction investment for capital construction, and is prepared to increase investment by several hundred million yuan. The Lanxin Railway, which was originally planned to only lay tracks to Hami this year, and the Neikun Railway, which was originally planned to only lay tracks to Yibin, can now undertake many more projects. The two main lines of the Southwest and Northwest railway networks—the Xiangqian Railway and the Lanqing Railway, as well as the railway from Wuhu to Yingtan in the south of the Yangtze River—will all start construction ahead of schedule this year. In addition, more than 4,000 freight cars, passenger cars, and locomotives will be purchased.
    Through the in-depth development of the rectification movement and the current anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the staff and workers of the national railways have been unprecedentedly high. Under the impetus of the Beijing Railway Administration's initiative—to launch a nationwide movement to produce one million ton-kilometers per day, and to adapt to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production with a great leap forward in railway transportation—a magnificent movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced quickly unfolded on the national railways. Exciting news from various railway bureaus came one after another. Following the Beijing Railway Administration's workers creating a national record of 1,034,400 ton-kilometers per day for freight locomotives on February 28, the Shanghai Railway Administration created a new record of 1,289,000 ton-kilometers per day for freight locomotives on the 4th, which was even higher than that of the Beijing Bureau. On the 6th, the Beijing Railway Administration overtook Shanghai again, creating a newer record of 1.34 million ton-kilometers. Other railway bureaus are also catching up rapidly. The movement is in full swing. New records change every day. Increasing the speed of trains and the daily output of freight locomotives is of great significance for improving the efficiency of railway transportation. The great leap forward in this comprehensive indicator will inevitably promote the great leap forward in the work of all departments of railway transportation.
    In design and capital construction work, there have also been many gratifying signs. The Ministry of Railways originally considered the indicator of designing 0.54 kilometers of railway per designer per year to be advanced. After the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the designers deeply tapped their potential, and everyone believed that they could design 1.7 kilometers of railway per person per year, striving to reach 2 kilometers. The Ministry of Railways originally required the Beijing Railway Administration to reduce the cost of above-quota projects by only 10% and below-quota projects by only 7% this year. After discussion by the masses, the bureau proposed 290 measures, and the cost of both above-quota and below-quota projects could be reduced by 18%.
    Judging from the situation reflected by the national railways' anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, there is still huge potential in both railway transportation and capital construction work. For example, the indicator of daily ton-kilometers produced by freight locomotives (that is, the product of the traction weight of each locomotive and the distance it travels in a day) reached an average of more than 500,000 ton-kilometers nationwide last year, which is already a fairly high achievement in the world. The Ministry of Railways originally considered that only a few bureaus would be able to reach the indicator of one million ton-kilometers per day for freight locomotives by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. Now it seems that after Beijing and Shanghai, most railway bureaus across the country can reach this target one after another.
    The Ministry of Railways' plan for increasing production and practicing economy was formulated under such a situation, after analyzing and comparing the railway enterprises across the country and summarizing the experience of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. It has a solid basis and mass foundation. The plan requires that the national railways' freight volume should reach 330 million tons this year, an increase of 20 million tons over the national plan, and an increase of 20.4% over last year's actual performance. The increased volume is mainly completed by leveraging the potential capacity of the equipment. For example, simply because the daily kilometer indicator of locomotives is 16 kilometers higher than the original plan and the turnover time indicator of freight cars is 0.22 days shorter than the original plan, it is equivalent to increasing the country's transport capacity by 100 locomotives and 5,000 railcars. The increase in transport volume will not only not increase personnel, but also reduce the number of transportation and business personnel by 10,000. Coal consumption for locomotives will be reduced by 600,000 tons throughout the year, and transportation business and industrial expenditures will be greatly reduced.
    In terms of capital construction, it is required that the cost of all above-quota and below-quota projects be reduced by 18%, and the cost of factory construction be reduced by 12%. During the First Five-Year Plan, the average cost of building one kilometer of railway was about 566,000 yuan, but now it only costs 400,000 yuan. If calculated according to the Ministry of Railways' preliminary proposal to build 15,000 kilometers of new railways during the Second Five-Year Plan, this item alone can save the country nearly 2.5 billion yuan.
    The Ministry of Railways convened a national railway bureau chiefs' conference in Shanghai on the 4th, and will then convene a conference of engineering bureau chiefs and railway factory directors to deploy this plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and to study how to organize the national railway great leap forward. Judging from the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the current national railway staff and workers, it is estimated that this plan for increasing production and practicing economy may not only be completed, but also very likely to be exceeded.

    铁道部是促进部
    把先进单位的指标变成全部的指标
    今年再为国家增产节约四亿五千万元
    本报讯　记者王良报道：全国铁路在整风运动和当前反浪费反保守运动中，出现一个朝气勃勃的生龙活虎的局面。群众性的全面大跃进的高潮正在形成。铁道部在这个基础上，提出今年要再为国家增产节约四亿五千万元的计划。
    国家经济委员会薄一波主任日前曾专门召开国务院所属工业、交通、财经、农林、水利各部的党组书记会议，听取铁道部关于增产节约问题的汇报。薄一波认为铁道部这个作法很好，经委将从各方面给予支持。他要求各个部也要迅速地订出本部的增产节约计划。
    为了加快铁路的建设速度，适应国民经济大跃进的需要，国家经济委员会已批准铁道部从今年基本建设投资中节约出的二亿零六百万元的资金再用到基本建设中去，并且准备再增加投资几亿元。原计划今年只铺轨到哈密的兰新铁路和铺轨到宜宾的内昆铁路，现在还可以多做许多工程。西南、西北铁路网的两条主要干线——湘黔铁路和兰青铁路以及江南从芜湖到鹰潭的铁路，都提前在今年动工建设。此外，还要再增购四千多辆货车、客车和机车。
    全国铁路通过深入开展的整风运动和当前的反浪费反保守运动，职工群众的社会主义觉悟和生产热情空前高涨。在北京铁路管理局的倡议——在全国开展日产百万吨公里运动，以铁路运输的大跃进来适应工农业生产的大跃进——的带动下，一个波澜壮阔的比先进、学先进、赶先进运动很快就在全国铁路展开。各个路局的振奋人心的消息，一个接着一个传来。继北京铁路局的职工在2月28日创造了全局货物机车日产一百零三万四千吨公里的全国最高纪录之后，上海铁路管理局又在4日创造了比北京局更高的货物机车日产一百二十八万九千吨公里的新纪录。6日，北京铁路管理局又赶过上海，创造了一百三十四万吨公里的更新的纪录。其他各个铁路局也正在急起直追。运动如火如荼。新纪录一天一变。提高列车的速度和货物机车的日产量，对于提高铁路运输的效率具有极大的意义。这个综合性指标的大跃进，必然会促进铁路运输各个部门工作的大跃进。
    在设计和基本建设工作方面，也出现了许多令人可喜的气象。铁道部原来认为每个设计人员每年设计零点五四公里铁路的指标是先进的，经过反浪费、反保守运动，设计人员深入挖掘潜力，大家认为每人每年可以设计一点七公里的铁路，争取达到二公里。铁道部原来要求北京铁路管理局今年限额以上工程只降低造价10％，限额以下工程只降低7％。这个局经过群众讨论以后，提出了二百九十条措施，限额以上和限额以下工程都可以降低造价18％。
    从全国铁路反浪费、反保守运动反映的情况看来，目前无论是铁路运输或基本建设工作，还存在着巨大的潜力。如货物机车日产吨公里这个指标（即每台机车的牵引重量与一天所跑的距离的乘积），去年全国平均达到五十多万吨公里，这在世界上来说已是相当高的成绩了。铁道部原来考虑到第二个五年计划末，只有少数几个局才能达到货物机车日产百万吨公里的指标。现在看来继北京和上海之后，全国多数铁路局都可以陆续达到。
    铁道部这个增产节约计划是在这样的形势下，对全国各个铁路企业作了分析、比较以及总结分析了第一个五年计划执行的经验然后作出来的，是有充分的根据和群众基础的。计划要求：今年全国铁路的货运量要达到三亿三千万吨，比国家计划增加两千万吨，比去年实绩提高20.4％。增加的运量主要是通过发挥设备的潜在能力来完成的。如仅仅由于机车日车公里指标比原计划提高十六公里和货车周转时间指标比原计划缩短零点二二天，就等于为国家增加一百台机车和五千个车皮的运力。运量增加不仅不增加人员，而且还可以减少一万个运输和营业人员。机车用煤全年节约六十万吨，并大大地降低运输营业和工业支出。
    在基本建设方面，要求限额以上和限额以下工程一律降低造价18％，工厂建设降低12％。在第一个五年计划中，平均每修一公里铁路的造价大约是五十六万六千元，现在只要四十万元就够了。如按铁道部初步提出第二个五年计划要新建一万五千公里的铁路计算，仅这一项就能为国家节约将近二十五亿元。
    铁道部4日在上海召开了全国铁路管理局局长会议，接着还要召开工程局长、铁路工厂厂长会议，布置这个增产节约计划，研究如何组织全国铁路大跃进。从目前全国铁路职工这样高涨的革命干劲来看，估计这个增产节约计划不仅可能完成，而且还很可能被突破。
