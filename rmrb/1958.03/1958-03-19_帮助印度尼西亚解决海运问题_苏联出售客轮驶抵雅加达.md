    Helping Indonesia Solve Maritime Transport Problems
    Soviet Union Sells Passenger Ships Arriving in Jakarta
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 18th: Indonesian Minister of Maritime Affairs Nazir said at a press conference this morning that the ships sold by the Soviet Union to Indonesia are satisfactory. The rapid arrival of these ships has solved the urgent needs of Indonesian maritime transport.
    Ten passenger ships, totaling 23,000 tons, arrived in Jakarta port on the 17th. These ships quickly sailed from Vladivostok in the Soviet Union on March 5th. Minister Nazir did not elaborate on how many other ships were purchased from the Soviet Union.
    The Minister said that part of the 100 million U.S. dollar loan from the Soviet Union to Indonesia will be used to pay for the Soviet ships. He said that the ships manufactured by the Soviet Union in 1954 are still very new, and the price per ton is 50 to 100 U.S. dollars cheaper than the world market price.
    The Minister said that Indonesia is not prepared to lease ships from foreign countries because the rental fees are too expensive. According to the original plan, Indonesia should also purchase more than 70,000 tons of ships from foreign countries, but the Minister did not further specify from which countries these ships would be purchased.

    帮助印度尼西亚解决海运问题
    苏联出售客轮驶抵雅加达
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚海运部长纳齐尔今天上午在记者招待会上说，苏联售给印度尼西亚的船只都是令人满意的。这些船只的迅速到达解决了印度尼西亚海运交通的迫切需要问题。
    有十艘总数达到二万三千吨的客轮已于17日到达雅加达港口，这些船只是在3月5日从苏联的海参崴启程迅速驶来的。纳齐尔部长没有详细说明从苏联还购买了多少艘其他船只。
    这位部长说，苏联借给印度尼西亚的一亿美元贷款中的一部分将用来支付苏联船只的价款。他说，苏联在1954年制造的船只仍然是很新的，每吨价钱比世界市场便宜五十美元到一百美元。
    这位部长说，印度尼西亚不准备向外国租赁船只，因为租费太贵。根据原先的计划，印度尼西亚还应当向外国购买七万多吨船只，但是这位部长没有进一步说明将从哪些国家购买这些船只。
