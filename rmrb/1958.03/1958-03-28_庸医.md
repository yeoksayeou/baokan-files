    Notes

    Quack Doctor
    The United States has contracted a contagious disease called economic recession. Eisenhower and his economic advisors are rushing around, prescribing a pile of remedies. One of the prescriptions is "tax cuts." Before the medicine could even be administered, these muddle-headed "doctors" discovered that it had side effects. According to the United Press, they are worried that this prescription will cause the public to buy less before the actual tax cut, and this phenomenon of buying less will only prolong the symptoms of the recession.
    This is truly a dilemma, "impossible to proceed."
    We are not gloating over misfortune. Marxism has long pointed out that the root cause of this disease is the anarchic state of production in capitalism. Eisenhower and his economic advisors are, of course, unwilling, dare not, and cannot face this source of the disease squarely, so the role they play can only be that of quack doctors who kill without shedding blood.

    庸医
    美国得了一种叫作经济衰退的传染病，艾森豪威尔和他的经济顾问们手忙脚乱地开了一堆药方。其中有一张用的药是“减税”。药还没有用下去，这帮昏头胀脑的“大夫”们就发现它有副作用了。据合众社报道：他们担心这张药方会使公众在真正减税以前少买东西，而这种少买东西的现象，又只能使得衰退的症候拖长。
    这真是进退两难、“行不得也”了。
    我们并不幸灾乐祸。马克思主义早就指出了，这种病症的根源就是资本主义的无政府生产状态。艾森豪威尔和他的经济顾问们，当然是不愿意、不敢也不能正视这个病源的，所以他们扮演的角色，只能是杀人不见血的庸医。
