　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 11th. The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee today issued statements supporting Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's letter to Ngo Dinh Diem and expressed the hope that world peace forces and the people of Asian and African countries will actively support the peace proposals put forward in the letter.

　　The statement of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace pointed out that the March 7 letter from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the South Vietnamese authorities is of great significance to the cause of Vietnam's reunification and the easing of the international situation. The statement said that the proposals in the letter for discussing disarmament and mutual trade between the North and South are practical and in line with the wishes of all the Vietnamese people. The statement called on the Southern authorities to respond promptly to the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　The Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee said in a statement that the peaceful initiatives put forward in the letter from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Ngo Dinh Diem are in line with the resolution of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference on the issue of Vietnam's reunification. This initiative will help to repel the new threat of war and ease the international situation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 11th. The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today saying that the support of the government of the People's Republic of China for the peaceful initiatives put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 7 is a major encouragement to the Vietnamese people's struggle for peace and reunification.

　　The editorial pointed out that the support of the government of the People's Republic of China is of great significance because China is not only a close neighbor of Vietnam, but also one of the participating countries in the Geneva Conference held in 1954. Together with the Soviet Union, it made a significant contribution to the Geneva Conference, thus restoring peace to Indochina.

　　The editorial then pointed out that the United States once publicly stated at the Geneva Conference that it would not undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords, but just over a month after the end of the conference, the United States organized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and attempted to drag South Vietnam into this group. Thus, "the United States has in fact formed a military alliance with South Vietnam, pushing South Vietnam onto the road of war preparation."

    越南两人民团体积极支持范文同建议
    越“人民报”欢迎我政府声明
    新华社河内11日电　越南保卫世界和平委员会和越南亚非人民团结委员会今天分别发表声明，支持范文同总理写给吴庭艳的信，并且希望世界和平力量和亚非各国人民积极支持这封信中提出的和平 建议。
    越南保卫世界和平委员会的声明指出，越南民主共和国政府3月7日给南越当局的信件对越南的统一事业和缓和国际局势具有重要意义。声明说，这封信中提出的讨论南北双方裁军和互通贸易的建议是切合实际和符合全体越南人民的愿望的。声明要求南方当局迅速响应越南民主共和国的建议。
    越南亚非人民团结委员会在声明中说，越南民主共和国政府给吴庭艳的信中所提出的和平倡议符合亚非人民团结大会关于越南统一问题的决议。这个倡议有助于打退新的战争威胁，缓和国际局势。
    据新华社河内11日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论说，中华人民共和国政府对越南民主共和国政府在3月7日提出的和平倡议的支持，是对越南人民争取和平、统一的斗争的一个重大鼓舞。
    社论指出，中华人民共和国政府的支持具有重大的意义，因为中国不仅是越南的近邻，同时也是1954年召开的日内瓦会议的参加国之一，它同苏联一起对日内瓦会议作了重大的贡献，因而使印度支那恢复了和平。
    社论接着指出，美国曾经在日内瓦会议上公开声明不破坏日内瓦协议的实施，可是就在会议结束后的一个多月，美国就组织了东南亚军事集团，并企图把南越拖入这个集团，这样，“美国在实际上已经同南越结成军事联盟，把南越推上备战的道路”。
