    Xinhua News Agency, March 21st dispatch from London: According to authoritative British sources, West Germany has requested the Western European Union to revise the Paris Agreements concluded in 1954, so that it can manufacture rocket weapons.

    Under the reservations of the Paris Agreements, which allowed West Germany to rearm, West Germany was prohibited from producing atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons. This provision was made at the time to alleviate fears about allowing West Germany to rearm in order to facilitate the approval of the agreement.

    It is reported that after West Germany made this request, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, Norstad, also made a similar suggestion to the Council of Ministers of the Western European Union, requesting that the Paris Agreements be revised to allow West Germany to manufacture rocket weapons.

    西德要求制造火箭
    据新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：据权威的英国人士说，西德已经要求西欧联盟修改1954年缔结的巴黎协定，以便它能够制造火箭武器。
    根据允许西德重新武装的巴黎协定的保留条款，西德被禁止生产原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器。当时作出这一规定，是为了缓和人们对允许西德重新武装的恐惧以便于使这个协定得到批准。
    据报道，在西德提出这个要求以后，北大西洋集团军队总司令诺斯塔德也已经向西欧联盟部长理事会提出类似的建议，要求修改巴黎协定让西德能够制造火箭武器。
