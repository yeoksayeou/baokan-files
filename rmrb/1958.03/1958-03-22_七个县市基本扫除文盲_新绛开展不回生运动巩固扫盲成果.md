    新绛县从去年冬季开始，在农业生产大跃进的同时，组织了扫盲大跃进。党委提出了“全党动手，全民动员，依靠三万（有文化的人），扫除一万（文盲）”的行动口号，发动全民奋斗了五十天，使识字的人达到青壮年总数的82.3％，成为基本无文盲县。到3月中旬止，巩县青壮年识字的人达到85.7％，鲁山县达到83％。
    哈尔滨市在今年1月份，青壮年职工中的非文盲已占青壮年职工总数的88％，成为全国第一个基本上扫除职工文盲的城市。齐齐哈尔市在今年2月也基本上扫除了全市职工中的文盲，青壮年职工中识字的人已达到青壮年职工总数的87％。
    为了进一步巩固扫盲成果，新绛县开展了一个“复习百遍，练写万字”的不回生运动，扫盲学员正在逐批转入业余高小学习。
