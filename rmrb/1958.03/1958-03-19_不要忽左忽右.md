    Don't Waver Back and Forth
    Wang Pu
    Reforming the unreasonable wage and welfare system is a very important task, and also a complex and arduous one. When the rectification campaign began, many employees had already exposed unreasonable wage and welfare phenomena, but the leaders of some enterprises still turned a deaf ear and dared not lead the masses to carry out reforms. After some enterprises creatively reformed some unreasonable wage and welfare systems, some enterprises rushed to make haphazard reforms, removing what was unreasonable but also what was reasonable. Some enterprises did not go through mass debate, but simply issued an order to reform. Recently, after the leadership organs at all levels proposed that the reform of unreasonable welfare systems must be carried out cautiously and must not reduce the actual wages of workers, some enterprises have gone from haphazard reforms to no reforms at all.
    Wage and welfare issues are important issues of socialist accumulation and distribution. In socialist society, distribution is carried out according to the principle of "to each according to his work." Excessively high and unreasonable wages and welfare indicate that the labor remuneration of some people exceeds what they should receive, and also indicates that the distribution ratio between accumulation and consumption is not entirely reasonable. This is not conducive to the unity of the working class, nor to the unity of the people of the whole country, and thus cannot encourage the people of the whole country to give play to their enthusiasm for production, nor can it promote the development of social productive forces. The fact that some workers demand the reform of unreasonable wage and welfare systems shows that the consciousness of the working class has been raised. We should pay attention to the opinions of the workers and always pay attention to adjusting unreasonable wage and welfare systems. The Party Central Committee said in the "Instructions on Launching the Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism Movement": "Now some masses have spontaneously demanded the abolition or change of those unreasonable wage and welfare systems. We should welcome and cherish such socialist selflessness and enthusiasm of the masses. However, in actually handling wage and welfare issues, a cautious attitude must be adopted. Those wage and welfare systems that truly hinder the unity of workers and peasants, hinder internal unity among employees, and are otherwise unfavorable to the socialist cause should be carefully studied, and appropriately adjusted with the approval of the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees (national ones must be approved by the central government). Other than that, do not reduce the actual wages of workers."
    Here, the so-called attitude of welcome and cherishment means not pouring cold water on the masses, and even if the demands put forward by the masses are one-sided, they should be corrected through mass discussion. The so-called cautious handling means carefully studying the demands of the masses, distinguishing which demands truly proceed from the 600 million people and are conducive to promoting the development of productive forces, and which demands are one-sided and reduce the actual wages of workers or increase the burden on the state. Then, after certain approval procedures, organize mass discussions and carry out reforms on the basis of the masses' conscious voluntariness. When the vast majority of the masses have not yet become aware of the need for reform, do not use administrative orders to force reform.
    However, some comrades one-sidedly understand the central government's instructions. In their view, to cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, we cannot reject the unreasonable demands of the masses; what should be reformed should be reformed, and what should not be reformed should also be reformed. To handle it cautiously, we can only simply not reform. To wait for the masses to be consciously voluntary is to let things drift and not to conduct political and ideological education among the masses. Such wavering back and forth in implementing instructions will not only fail to reform unreasonable wage and welfare systems, but also risks turning good things into bad things.
    The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has created very favorable conditions for reforming unreasonable wage and welfare systems. The news about the 37 factories in Chengdu published in this newspaper today shows that through organizing employees to conduct debates, not only can various unreasonable wage and welfare systems be reformed, but also the awareness of workers can be raised, helping workers establish a viewpoint of looking at problems from the perspective of the 600 million people, and helping workers correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, and between the individual and the state. Now is a good time to ride the wind and waves, and we must not miss the great opportunity.

    不要忽左忽右
    王朴
    改革不合理的工资福利制度，是一项十分重要的工作，也是一件复杂的艰巨的工作。开始整风的时候，许多职工已经揭发工资福利方面的不合理现象，但是，有些企业的领导同志仍然置若罔闻，不敢领导群众进行改革，等到一些企业创造性地改革了一些不合理的工资福利制度以后，有的企业又匆匆忙忙地乱改乱革，改掉了不合理的。也改掉了合理的，有的企业不经过群众辩论，只简单地下一道命令加以改革。最近，各级领导机关提出改革不合理的生活福利制度必须谨慎从事、不得降低职工的实际工资以后，有些企业又从乱改革变为不改革了。
    工资和福利问题，是社会主义积累和分配的重要问题。在社会主义社会里，是按照“按劳付酬”的原则进行分配的。过高的、不合理的工资和福利，就说明有一部分人的劳动报酬超过了他们所应该得到的，也说明积累同消费的分配比例不完全合理，这就不利于工人阶级的团结，不利于全国人民的团结，因而就不能鼓励全国人民发挥生产的积极性，不能促进社会生产力的发展。有些工人要求改革不合理的工资福利制度，说明工人阶级的觉悟已经提高。我们应该重视工人的意见，时时注意调整不合理的工资福利制度。党中央在“关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示”中说：“现在已经有些群众自动要求取消或者改变那些不合理的工资福利制度。我们对于群众这种社会主义的大公无私的表现和热情，应该欢迎和爱护。但是在实际处理工资福利问题的时候，必须采取谨慎的态度。对于那些真正妨碍工农团结、妨碍职工内部团结和其他不利于社会主义事业的工资福利制度，应该经过细心地研究，经过省、市、自治区党委批准（全国性的要经过中央批准），作恰当的调整，除此以外，不要降低工人的实际工资。”
    这里所谓采取欢迎和爱护的态度，就是不要向群众头上泼冷水，即使群众提出的要求有片面性，也要通过群众的讨论来纠正。所谓谨慎处理，就是认真研究群众的要求，分辨哪些要求是真正从六亿人口出发的，有利于促进生产力的发展的，哪些要求是片面的，是降低工人的实际工资或者增加国家负担的。然后，经过一定的批准手续，组织群众讨论，在群众自觉自愿的基础上进行改革。当绝大多数群众还没有改革的觉悟的时候，不要用行政命令的办法强迫改革。
    然而，有些同志却片面地理解中央这个指示。在他们来看，要爱护群众的热情，就不能拒绝群众的不合理的要求，应该改革的要改革，不应改革的也要改革。要谨慎处理，就只好干脆不改革。要等待群众自觉自愿，就是放任自流，不向群众进行政治和思想教育。这样忽左忽右地执行指示，不但改革不了不合理的工资福利制度，而且还有把好事变为坏事的危险。
    反浪费反保守运动，给改革不合理的工资福利制度创造了十分有利的条件。今天本报发表的成都三十七个工厂的新闻说明，通过组织职工进行辩论，不但能够改革各种不合理的工资福利制度，还能够提高工人的觉悟，帮助工人树立从六亿人口出发看问题的观点，帮助工人正确处理个人与集体、个人与国家的关系。现在正是乘风破浪的好时机，千万不要错过大好时光。
