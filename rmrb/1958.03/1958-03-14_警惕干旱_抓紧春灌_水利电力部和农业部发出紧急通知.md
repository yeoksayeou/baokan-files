Beware of Drought, Seize Spring Irrigation
Urgent Notice Issued by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power and the Ministry of Agriculture

(Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued an urgent notice on the 12th to vigorously carry out spring irrigation to promote a great leap forward in agriculture.

The notice said: Since last autumn, in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, and central and western Inner Mongolia, the rainfall in the past five months (October last year to February this year) has been 30%-60% less than the average rainfall for the same period in previous years. In many areas, there was insufficient soil moisture when winter wheat was sown to resist drought. According to the meteorological patterns of previous years, North China and Northwest China may experience severe spring drought this year. In order to ensure sufficient moisture for the reviving growth of wheat and overwintering crops, and to ensure the timely sowing of cotton and other spring-sown crops, spring irrigation has become the top priority in leading spring agricultural production.

The notice requires water conservancy and agricultural departments in all provinces, under the unified leadership of local party and government, to make comprehensive plans and unified arrangements, and to seize spring irrigation with the same revolutionary drive as building farmland water conservancy projects. The notice also puts forward the following suggestions, requiring local areas to make proper arrangements in spring plowing preparation: 1. Spring irrigation plans and targets should be quickly implemented to the townships and communes. Do a good job in mobilizing the masses ideologically and set off a high tide of spring irrigation. 2. Vigorously promote water conservation, innovate irrigation technology, irrigate day and night, and improve irrigation efficiency. Resolutely eliminate water waste phenomena such as breaches and water leakage. 3. Combine spring plowing with repairing canals, leveling land, and building ridges. Overhaul pumping machinery and train drivers. 4. Make good arrangements for water use upstream and downstream, rationally allocate water volume, avoid water use disputes, and vigorously save water to expand the irrigated area. 5. In well-irrigated areas with insufficient water lifting tools, mobilize the masses to make full use of existing water lifting tools, manufacture simple water lifting tools, and arrange labor for immediate spring irrigation. 6. Spring irrigation should be closely combined with agricultural technology, strengthen the work of preserving soil moisture in winter-irrigated bare land, and strive to avoid spring irrigation. Also, combine top dressing, strengthen frost and pest prevention work. Launch a socialist competition movement between irrigation districts, between communes, to compare water saving, compare increased production, and compare innovative technologies to promote spring irrigation.

    警惕干旱  抓紧春灌
    水利电力部和农业部发出紧急通知
    本报讯  水利电力部和农业部12日联合发出大力开展春灌，促进农业大跃进的紧急通知。
    通知说：从去秋以来河北、山西、山东、陕西、甘肃、内蒙古中部和西部，五个月来（去年10月到今年2月），降雨量少于历年同期雨量的30％—60％。不少地区，去年冬小麦抗旱播种，底墒不足。根据历年来气象规律，今年华北、西北可能春旱严重。为了保证小麦和越冬作物返青生长期间有充足的水分，保证棉花等春播作物适时下种，春灌工作便成为领导春季农业生产中的头等任务。
    通知要求各省水利、农业部门在当地党政统一领导下，全面规划，统一安排，以抓兴修农田水利的革命干劲，同样的把春灌工作抓起来。通知还提出以下意见，要求各地春季备耕中加以妥善安排：一、春灌计划指标迅速贯彻到乡、社。作好群众思想动员，掀起一个春灌高潮。二、大力提倡节约用水，革新灌溉技术，昼夜灌溉，提高浇地效率。坚决消灭决口、跑水等浪费水量现象。三、结合春耕进行整修渠道、平地、打畦。检修抽水机械，培训司机。四、作好上、下游用水安排，合理调配水量，避免用水纠纷，并应大力节约水量，扩大灌溉面积。五、提水工具不足的井灌区，发动群众充分利用旧有提水工具，并制造简单的提水工具，安排劳力，即时春灌。六、春灌与农业技术密切结合，加强冬灌白地保墒工作，争取不春灌。并结合追肥，加强防霜、防虫工作。开展灌区与灌区之间，社与社之间比省水、比增产、比革新技术的社会主义竞赛运动，推动春灌。
