Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 15th: Jiangsu Province has afforested both banks of the Yangtze River within its borders in just over two months. The 1,000-kilometer-long river embankment has been widely planted with five or more rows of willow trees, with many "youth wave-break forests" appearing. The slender willow branches have now sprouted and grown leaves. The vast Yangtze River has been trimmed with a light green border.

In addition, some of the low-lying beaches outside the embankment have been planted with reeds, and the inner slopes of the river embankment have been planted with economically valuable purple-flowered acacia.

At the end of last year, the Jiangsu Province's mobilization conference for greening the Yangtze River issued a call to the people along the river to "green the Yangtze in two years and finish up in three years." Following this call, the farmers of Xiashu Township in Jurong County greened nine miles of river embankment in two days, setting an example of a great leap forward for the people along the river.

    长江镶上绿色花边
    据新华社南京15日电　江苏省两个多月绿化了境内的长江两岸。一千公里长的江堤，普遍种上了五排以上的柳树，出现了很多“青年防浪林”。细长的柳条现在已发芽生叶。辽阔的长江，被镶上了淡绿色的花边。
    另外，堤外低滩有的还种上了芦柴，江堤内坡种上了经济价值较大的紫穗槐。
    去年年底，江苏省绿化长江动员大会向沿江人民提出“两年绿化长江、三年扫尾”的号召后，句容县下蜀乡的农民在两天内就绿化九里江堤，给沿江人民树立了跃进的榜样。
