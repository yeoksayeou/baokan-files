    Rich Achievements of Czechoslovak-Chinese Friendly Cooperation
    Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Bushiniyak
    It was exactly a year ago in March that the Czechoslovak government delegation headed by Prime Minister Viliam Široký visited the People's Republic of China. On March 27, the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic, the issuance of a joint statement, and the signing of a cultural cooperation agreement and a health cooperation agreement. The Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples have always been linked by deep, brotherly friendship. The visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China further deepened and consolidated this brotherly friendship. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed a year ago, as well as the joint statement issued at the end of the delegation's visit, clearly demonstrated that the two governments and peoples shared completely identical views on all issues.
    If we look back at the period since the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China, we will see the convincingly correct nature of the principles established in the above-mentioned documents a year ago, and that Czechoslovak-Chinese friendship is built on this rock-solid foundation. The visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China took place after the imperialist aggression against Egypt and their attempt to detach Hungary from the fraternal socialist family. This visit undoubtedly contributed to the consolidation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. How glorious have been the achievements of our camp and all progressive forces in the world in the process of further consolidation since that period! The grand events held in Moscow to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, as well as the concurrent meetings of Communist and Workers' Parties, the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, and the Peace Manifesto of the meeting of representatives of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties, the enormous increase in the political prestige and material strength of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, and the historically significant fact that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind—all of this fills us with boundless excitement and pride. This is especially because the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, along with the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Soviet Union and other countries, have consistently believed and still believe that consolidating the socialist camp is one of their primary tasks and are doing their utmost to accomplish this task.
    The views on foreign policy and international issues in the aforementioned documents are also completely consistent. In the year since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, great achievements have also been made in this regard. World public opinion's pressure to ease international tensions and the sympathy and support gained by the proactive peace policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are so strong that even the most aggressive forces have to take them into account. In making the greatest efforts to defend humanity from a new devastating war, China and Czechoslovakia not only stand firmly on the same front as the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp, but also make tremendous efforts in this regard. The recent agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea and the demand for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is one of the latest examples. The visit of Czechoslovak Prime Minister Viliam Široký to Southeast Asian countries not long ago undoubtedly promoted the consolidation of the ideas of peace and friendship between these countries and Czechoslovakia, thereby also promoting the consolidation of the idea of world peace.
    The period since the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China has been particularly important for both China and Czechoslovakia.
    The year since the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China has been a year in which China completed its First Five-Year Plan and prepared to implement its Second Five-Year Plan, a year in which the great rectification campaign began, a year in which the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people waged a resolute and victorious struggle against rightists, and also a year in which the Communist Party of China put forward historically significant tasks to the Chinese people: to catch up with or surpass the second most powerful and most developed capitalist country, Britain, in important industrial products, to realize the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program in agriculture, to achieve a great leap forward in the development of socialist agricultural production, to eliminate illiteracy in five years, and to demand a great leap forward in science within ten years.
    The Chinese people not only successfully completed their First Five-Year Plan, but also overfulfilled it in many important aspects, thereby establishing a solid foundation for socialist industrialization and laying the foundation for becoming a modern socialist power in fifteen to twenty years.
    During the First Five-Year Plan, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the socialist transformation of agriculture, industry, commerce, and handicrafts was achieved ahead of schedule. In this way, the socialist revolution was basically completed in terms of production relations, and China took a major step forward in building a socialist society.
    The preparations for the Second Five-Year Plan were carried out during the great national rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle. The rightists had attempted to use the opportunity of the rectification campaign to attack the foundations of China's socialist system. However, they were resolutely countered by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and suffered a crushing defeat. The decisive victory of the anti-rightist struggle clearly shows that the Chinese people consider the socialist system to be their own system and are determined to defend it against anyone who dares to touch it. The process and results of the rectification campaign show that workers in factories, peasants in rural areas, as well as intellectuals and all honest patriots are rapidly learning to master and lead socialist production, technology, science, and culture, and are more actively participating in the management of state affairs. In the first few weeks of 1958, the results of the plan's completion and the bold tasks of exceeding the plan proposed by the working people themselves clearly show that the great tasks put forward by the Communist Party of China will not only be completed, but will be overfulfilled. This fully confirms a Marxist-Leninist truth: how much power, talent, and initiative the working people who are freed from exploitation and are masters of their own affairs can unleash.
    In the past year, the Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have also made remarkable achievements: industrial production increased by 10.2%, which is two and seven-tenths times higher than the output during the bourgeois Czechoslovak Republic. In many products, Czechoslovakia has caught up with or is close to the output of the most developed capitalist countries on a per capita basis.
    During the bourgeois Czechoslovak Republic, Slovakia was an extremely backward region. However, since liberation, its industrial output has increased almost sevenfold.
    Since the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China, Czechoslovakia has made many gratifying achievements in building socialist agriculture and establishing unified agricultural cooperatives. During this period, the proportion of the socialist sector in arable land has increased from 46% to 67%. In this way, the task stipulated in Czechoslovakia's Second Five-Year Plan that the socialist sector in agriculture will account for an absolute majority by 1960 can be completed ahead of schedule. In recent weeks, the patriotic movement initiated by the members of cooperatives in the Ihrava region is spreading among the members of cooperatives in Czechoslovakia. The goal of this movement is to complete the 1960 task before the end of 1959, that is, to complete the five-year plan of agricultural production in four years.
    Czechoslovakia has also made new achievements in improving living standards.
    In the last few months of last year, the Czechoslovak people conducted a nationwide debate on improving the efficiency of the national economy and improving management methods. Just like the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement that is being carried out smoothly in China, Czechoslovakia's nationwide debate is not just an economic issue. The great debate also involved the struggle between the new and the old, the struggle between the advanced and the conservative, extensively mobilizing all working people to fight more resolutely for new achievements in socialist construction, enabling more working people to participate in state management, and further strengthening socialist democracy. Let those who want to teach us what democracy is look at the situation where millions of Chinese people actively participate in the rectification campaign and tens of millions of Czechoslovak people participate in the national debate, and put away their self-righteous evidence of how democratic their management methods are. The debate in Czechoslovakia and the measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia based on the debate to improve the management methods of the national economy are part of the preparations for the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. This congress will be held this year and will put forward historical tasks to the Czechoslovak people: to complete the socialist construction of Czechoslovakia.
    Since the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China, the friendship and cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia in various fields have been further deepened and consolidated. In October last year, the Czechoslovak parliamentary delegation headed by Comrade Fierlinger, Chairman of the National Assembly of Czechoslovakia, visited the People's Republic of China. The delegation participated in the celebrations of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and visited many cities, factories, cooperatives, and universities, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the vibrant new life in the People's Republic of China. In December last year, the Czechoslovak military delegation headed by Defense Minister Lomsky visited the People's Republic of China. This delegation also spent a lot of time learning in detail the rich experience of their comrades-in-arms, the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, and learning from these experiences.
    In the most painful days of President Zápotocký's death, the Chinese people expressed their deep friendship and loyal feelings towards the Czechoslovak people.
    The various agreements signed between the Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of China have been implemented smoothly. The tasks stipulated in the 1957 implementation plan of the cultural cooperation agreement have been successfully completed, and the 1958 implementation plan of the cultural cooperation agreement was signed not long ago. The health cooperation agreement signed during the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China has also begun to be implemented smoothly. However, the most extensive relationship between China and Czechoslovakia is in the economic field. This relationship is constantly developing and deepening, and is providing increasing assistance to our two countries in socialist construction. In September last year, the Fifth Meeting of the Czechoslovak-Chinese Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee was held in Beijing. Both sides will help each other on many important scientific or technical issues. In terms of trade relations, the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic supply each other with materials that are extremely important to the economies of both countries. Czechoslovak experts are helping to build many factories in China, especially power stations.
    The materials supplied by China to Czechoslovakia are a major support to the Czechoslovak economy. This assistance is not only in terms of food, but also in industrial production. The 1958 trade agreement will be signed in Beijing in the next few days. This agreement will be another major step in the development of trade relations between our two countries, and will correspondingly accelerate the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic.
    In all these forms of mutual relations between our two countries, striving for mutual understanding is no longer the main task. Of course, we will continue to strive for better mutual understanding in the future. However, the main principle of the mutual relations between our two countries is now and will always be: to strive with all our strength to make all these forms of cooperation between us the greatest and most effective practical help to both sides in solving the problems of socialist construction in both countries. The practical help we are referring to is not only mutual assistance in the economic field—although mutual assistance in this area is the main one, but also mutual assistance in the cultural, scientific, health, and other fields, because in this way our relationship will most effectively accelerate the socialist construction of our two countries, and thereby strengthen the entire world socialist system and strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Since the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to China and the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, the development of Czechoslovak-Chinese relations has fully confirmed the profound correctness of what Comrade Siroky, Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia, said in his speech at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:
    "Although our two countries have considerable differences in size, population, cultural traditions, and economic structure; however, socialist and communist ideas and undertakings, the common great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, the common struggle against all conspiracies and provocations of imperialist aggressive forces, and the consistency of the struggle for the happiness and prosperity of the people, for peace and the friendship of all peoples all make us feel infinitely cordial. Therefore, there will always be friendship and love between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, and our cooperation will bring us richer and richer results year after year."

  Hungary and Democratic Germany Issue Communiqué on Talks Resolutely Defending Marxism-Leninism
  Emphasis on the Establishment of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Europe
    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on the 25th, the party and government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the Hungarian People's Republic held talks during the visit of the Hungarian party and government delegation to the Democratic Republic. The two sides issued a communiqué after the talks, stating that the two sides exchanged views on the following issues: the policies and struggles of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, current international situation, the common struggle to maintain and strengthen peace, socialist construction in the two countries, further strengthening the unity of socialist countries, and developing the fraternal ties between the two countries. The two sides were in complete agreement on all the issues discussed.
    The communiqué emphasized that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party will unswervingly follow the decisions of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. The two parties believe that particularly important tasks are: to maintain the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory, to defend this theory uncompromisingly, and to apply this theory creatively. They affirm that an unremitting struggle against revisionism is an indispensable prerequisite for the victory of socialism. At the same time, the two parties will continue to resolutely fight against dogmatism and sectarianism, as well as other deviations from Marxism-Leninism.
    In the spirit of proletarian internationalism, the two parties will tirelessly strengthen the fraternal ties between the two parties, as well as the ties with all other Marxist-Leninist parties, especially with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; the two parties will do everything possible to strengthen the unity and cohesion of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.
    In the part of the communiqué concerning the international situation, the two sides welcomed the rising popular movement against the threat of atomic war and the Soviet proposal to convene a high-level international conference. The communiqué emphasized that the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe is of extremely great significance.
    The two delegations also expressed support for the Soviet proposals on the cessation of nuclear tests, the prohibition of the production and use of atomic weapons, the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in European countries, and other measures to gradually achieve disarmament. They firmly condemned the imperialist blocs, particularly the United States and West Germany, for attempting to obstruct agreements between countries on the most important issues of eliminating the atomic threat.
    The communiqué emphasized that the only way to peacefully restore German unity is for the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to approach each other and reach mutual understanding, and to establish a confederation of the two Germanys.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: According to the German News Agency, the Hungarian party and government delegation concluded its five-day visit to the Democratic Republic and left Berlin by special train on the morning of the 25th to return home. Among those who came to the station to see them off were Prime Minister Grotewohl of the Democratic Republic, First Secretary Ulbricht of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and more than 15,000 Berlin citizens.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 26th: The Hungarian party and government delegation, headed by Prime Minister Münnich, returned to Budapest on the 26th. Hungarian party and government leaders Kádár, Apro, Kish, and others went to the station to greet them.
    Prime Minister Münnich said to the welcoming crowd at the railway station that the views of both sides were completely identical, and there were no differences of opinion on political issues and economic cooperation issues. Through this meeting, the friendship between the peoples of the two countries has been further strengthened.

    捷中友好合作的丰富成果
    捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使　布希尼亚克
    正是一年前的3月间，以威廉·西罗基总理为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问了中华人民共和国。3月27日，捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的访问以签订中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国友好合作条约、发表联合声明和签订文化合作协定和保健合作协定而达到高潮。中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民一向是由深厚的兄弟般的友谊联结在一起的。而捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的访问中国则更加加深和巩固了这一兄弟般的友谊。一年前签订的友好合作条约，以及在代表团结束访问时发表的联合声明明显地表明：两国政府和人民对所有问题的看法是完全一致的。
    如果我们回顾一下在捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国以后的这一时期，我们就会看到一年前上述文件中所确定的原则令人信服的正确性，而中捷友谊就是建立在这一坚如磐石的基础之上的。捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的访问中国是在帝国主义侵略埃及事件以及它们企图使匈牙利脱离兄弟般的社会主义大家庭之后进行的。这次访问毫无疑问在巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营方面作出了贡献。在这一时期以后，我们的阵营和世界上一切进步力量在进一步巩固的过程中获得了多么辉煌的成就啊！在莫斯科为庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年举行的盛大活动、以及与此同时举行的共产党和工人党会议、社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议的和平宣言、社会主义国家首先是苏联在政治威信和物质力量方面的巨大增长、东风压倒西风这一具有历史意义的事实——这一切都使我们无比兴奋和自豪。这特别是因为中国共产党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党与苏联共产党以及其他国家共产党和工人党过去和现在都一致认为：巩固社会主义阵营是它们的首要任务之一，并以全力来完成这一任务。
    上述文件中对外交政策和国际问题的观点也是完全一致的。在签订友好合作条约以来的一年中，这方面也获得了很大的成就。世界舆论对缓和国际紧张局势方面所加的压力、苏联和其他社会主义国家的主动的和平政策所获得的同情和支持是如此的强大，以致最富于侵略性的势力也不得不加以考虑。在尽最大的努力保卫人类使其免于新的毁灭性战争方面，中国和捷克斯洛伐克不仅坚决地和苏联以及社会主义阵营其他各国站在一条战线上，并且在这方面进行着巨大的努力。不久以前，中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的协定以及关于一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的要求，就是最新的明证之一。捷克斯洛伐克总理威廉·西罗基不久以前在东南亚国家的访问，毫无疑问促进了这些国家和捷克斯洛伐克之间的和平与友好思想的巩固，从而也促进了世界和平思想的巩固。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国后的这一时期，对中国和捷克斯洛伐克来说都是特别重要的。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国后的这一年，是中国完成了第一个五年计划并准备执行第二个五年计划的一年，是伟大的整风运动开始的一年，是中国共产党和中国人民对右派分子进行坚决的和胜利的斗争的一年，也是中国共产党向中国人民提出了具有历史意义的任务的一年，这些任务是要在重要工业产品方面赶上或超过第二个最强大和最发达的资本主义大国——英国，要在农业方面实现十二年农业发展纲要，在发展社会主义农业生产方面来个大跃进，在五年中扫除文盲，并要求科学在十年内实现大跃进。
    中国人民不仅顺利地完成了自己的第一个五年计划，而且在许多重要方面超额完成了五年计划，从而建立了社会主义工业化的巩固基础，并为在十五年到二十年内成为现代的社会主义强国打下了基础。
    在第一个五年计划期间，在中国共产党领导下，提前实现了农业、工商业和手工业的社会主义改造。这样就在生产关系方面基本上完成了社会主义革命，并使中国在建设社会主义社会方面跃进了一大步。
    第二个五年计划的准备工作是在伟大的全民性整风运动和反右派斗争的过程中进行的。而右派分子则曾经企图利用整风运动的机会来攻击中国社会主义制度的基础。可是他们遭到了中国共产党和中国人民的坚决反击，并遭到了惨败。反右派斗争决定性的胜利清楚地说明，中国人民认为社会主义制度是自己的制度，并坚决保卫这一制度，反对任何敢于触动它的人。整风运动的过程和结果表明，工厂里的工人、农村中的农民以及知识分子和一切正直的爱国者正在快马加鞭地学习掌握和领导社会主义的生产、技术、科学和文化，并更加积极地参加管理国家事务。在1958年最初的几个星期中，完成计划的结果以及劳动人民自己提出的超额完成计划的大胆任务明确地说明：中国共产党提出的伟大任务不仅会完成，并且将超额完成。这充分证实了一个马克思列宁主义的真理：摆脱了剥削的劳动人民和当家作主的人民能够发挥多么大的力量、才能和首创精神。
    在最近一年中，捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党的领导下也取得了显著的成就：工业产量增长了10.2％，比资产阶级捷克斯洛伐克共和国时期的产量高二点七倍。在许多产品方面，按人口计算捷克斯洛伐克已经赶上或接近最发达的资本主义国家的产量。
    在资产阶级的捷克斯洛伐克共和国时期，斯洛伐克是极落后的地区。可是，自从解放以来，它的工业产量几乎提高了七倍。
    自从捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国以来，捷克斯洛伐克在建设社会主义农业和建立统一农业合作社方面取得了许多令人欣慰的成就。在这一时期中，社会主义部分在耕地面积中所占的比重已从46％上升到67％。这样，捷克斯洛伐克第二个五年计划所规定的关于1960年农业中的社会主义部分将占绝对优势的任务就能够提前完成。最近几个星期以来，伊赫拉瓦州的合作社社员们发起的爱国运动，正在捷克斯洛伐克的合作社社员们中开展着。这个运动的目标是在1959年年底以前完成1960年的任务，也就是在四年中完成农业产量的五年计划。
    捷克斯洛伐克在提高生活水平方面也获得了新的成就。
    在去年的最后几个月中，捷克斯洛伐克人民进行了关于提高国民经济效率和改善管理方式的全民大辩论。正像在中国顺利地进行着的反浪费和反保守运动一样，捷克斯洛伐克的全民大辩论并不仅仅是经济问题。大辩论还进行了新与旧的斗争、先进与保守的斗争，广泛地发动全体劳动人民更坚决地为争取社会主义建设的新成就而奋斗，使更多的劳动人民参加国家管理，进一步加强社会主义民主。让那些想要教训我们什么是民主的人们看一下，千百万中国人民群众积极参加整风运动和千千万万捷克斯洛伐克人民群众参加全民大辩论的情形，并收起他们那套自认是十分正确的关于他们的管理方法是多么民主的证据吧。在捷克斯洛伐克进行的大辩论和捷共中央根据大辩论所采取的改善国民经济管理方法的措施，是捷共第十一次代表大会准备工作的一部分。这次代表大会将在今年举行，并将向捷克斯洛伐克人民提出历史性的任务——完成捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设。
    自从捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国以来，中捷友谊和各方面的合作获得了进一步的加深和巩固。去年10月间，以捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席费林格同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克议会代表团访问了中华人民共和国。代表团参加了中华人民共和国建国八周年的庆祝活动，访问了许多城市、工厂、合作社和高等学校，从而对中华人民共和国朝气蓬勃的新生活的发展有了更深入的了解。去年12月间，以国防部长洛姆斯基为首的捷克斯洛伐克军事代表团访问了中华人民共和国。这个代表团也花了许多时间来详细地了解自己的战友——光荣的中国人民解放军的丰富经验，并学习这些经验。
    在萨波托斯基总统逝世的最沉痛的日子里，中国人民表达了对捷克斯洛伐克人民深厚的友谊和忠实的情感。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国和中华人民共和国之间签订的各项协定执行得很顺利。文化合作协定1957年度执行计划所规定的各项任务已顺利地完成了，并在不久以前签订了文化合作协定1958年度执行计划。在捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国期间签订的保健合作协定也已开始顺利地执行了。然而，捷中两国之间最广泛的关系是在经济方面。这种关系正在不断发展和加深，并在社会主义建设方面给予我们两国越来越大的帮助。去年9月间在北京举行了捷中科学技术合作委员会第五次会议。双方都要在许多重要的科学或技术问题上互相帮助。在贸易关系方面，中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国互相供给对两国经济极为重要的物资。捷克斯洛伐克专家们正在中国帮助建设许多工厂，特别是发电站。
    中国供给捷克斯洛伐克的物资是对捷克斯洛伐克经济的重大支援。这种援助不仅是在粮食方面，并且还在工业生产方面。最近几天内将在北京签订1958年度贸易协定。这一协定将是我们两国贸易关系发展中的又一个重大步骤，并将相应地加速中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国的社会主义建设。
    在我们两国相互关系的所有这些形式中，仅仅争取相互了解早已不成为主要的任务了。当然，今后我们还要争取更好地相互了解。可是，我们两国间相互关系的主要准则现在是、将来还是：全力争取使我们之间的所有这些合作方式在解决两国社会主义建设的问题时成为双方最大的、最有效的实际帮助。我们所指的实际帮助并不仅仅是经济方面的互助——虽然这方面的互助是主要的，而且还有文化、科学、保健等方面的互助，因为这样我们的关系就会最有效地加速我们两国的社会主义建设，并从而加强整个世界社会主义体系，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营。
    自从捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团访问中国并签订了友好合作条约以来，捷中关系的发展完全证实了捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基同志在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上演讲中所说的话的深刻的正确性：
    “虽然我们两个国家面积大小，人口数量，文化传统，经济结构都有不小的差异；但是，社会主义共产主义思想和事业，共同的马克思列宁主义伟大思想和无产阶级国际主义，对于帝国主义侵略势力的一切阴谋和挑衅的共同斗争以及为了争取人民的幸福繁荣，为了和平和各国人民的友谊而斗争的一致性都使得我们感到无限亲切。因此，中捷两国人民之间将永远存在着友谊和热爱，我们的合作将为我们带来一年比一年更加丰富的成果。”
  匈牙利和民主德国发表会谈公报坚决保卫马克思列宁主义
  强调欧洲应建立无原子武器区
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社柏林25日讯：德意志民主共和国和匈牙利人民共和国两国党和政府代表团在匈牙利党和政府代表团访问民主德国期间举行了会谈。双方在会谈以后发表公报说，双方就下列问题交换了意见：德国统一社会党和匈牙利社会主义工人党的政策和斗争的问题、当前国际局势问题、为维护和加强和平共同进行斗争的问题、两国社会主义建设问题、进一步加强社会主义国家的团结和发展两国之间的兄弟联系的问题。双方对所讨论的全部问题意见完全一致。
    公报着重说，德国统一社会党和匈牙利社会主义工人党将毫不动摇地遵循各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的决定。两党认为特别重要的任务是：维护马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁、不妥协地保卫这个理论，以及创造性地运用这个理论。它们确认，同修正主义进行无情的斗争是社会主义胜利必不可缺的前提。同时，两党仍将坚决同教条主义和宗派主义以及脱离马克思列宁主义的其他偏向进行斗争。
    两党本着无产阶级国际主义的精神，将不倦地加强两党间的兄弟联系，以及同所有其他马克思列宁主义政党、特别是同苏联共产党的联系；两党将尽一切力量加强各国共产党和工人党的团结一致。
    在公报中有关国际局势的部分里，双方表示欢迎日益高涨的反对原子战争威胁的人民运动以及苏联关于召开高级国际会议的建议。公报强调指出在欧洲建立无原子武器区的问题具有极为重大的意义。
    两国代表团还表示支持苏联的关于停止核试验、禁止生产和使用原子武器、撤出驻在欧洲国家境内的外国军队的建议以及其他逐步实现裁军的措施。它们坚决谴责帝国主义集团，特别是美国和西德想阻挠各国就最重要的消除原子威胁的问题达成协议的企图。
    公报强调指出，和平恢复德国统一的唯一道路是德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近并互相谅解以及建立两个德国的邦联。
    据新华社26日讯　据德意志通讯社报道：匈牙利党和政府代表团结束了在民主德国的五天访问，在25日上午乘专车离柏林回国。到车站欢送的有民主德国总理格罗提渥、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和柏林市民一万五千余人。
    据新华社布达佩斯26日电　以明尼赫总理为首的匈牙利党和政府代表团26日回到了布达佩斯。匈牙利党和政府领导人卡达尔、奥普罗、基什等都前往车站迎接。
    明尼赫总理在火车站对欢迎的群众说，双方的观点完全一致，在政治问题和经济合作问题上都没有出现分歧意见。通过这次会谈，两国人民的友谊更进一步加强了。
