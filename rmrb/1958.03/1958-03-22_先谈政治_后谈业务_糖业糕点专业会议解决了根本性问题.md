Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The Second Ministry of Commerce recently convened the Third National Sugar and Pastry Industry Conference using the method of "discussing political thought first, then doing business," and the results were very good. In the past, the professional conferences convened by this ministry focused solely on business. Because everyone's thinking was inconsistent and lacked an overall perspective, everyone wanted more of the fast-selling commodities and less of the slow-selling commodities, which often led to disputes. Although a balance was eventually struck, the problem could not be fundamentally solved. This time, they adopted a new method for holding the meeting, which not only solved this problem but also promoted a great leap forward in the national sugar and pastry industry.

    At the beginning of the meeting, everyone was guided to speak out freely, post big-character posters, and examine the main reasons for the long-term shortages of the three major commodities in this industry—sugar and dairy products—and the long-term stockpiling of canned food, and to investigate the ideological roots. Combining the study of documents, everyone had a correct understanding of the issue of "breaking the old balance and establishing a new balance," criticized the conservative thinking of "seeing things but not people," ignoring the subjective initiative of people, and carried out heated criticism and self-criticism between superiors and subordinates, and between regions.

    In this way, before discussing business, everyone reached a consensus in their thinking. Everyone realized that the key to not doing well in the past was the lack of a strong production perspective and mass perspective. For sugar and milk powder, which were in short supply in the market, no effective measures were taken to increase production for a long time. There were also mechanical balancing views in the distribution. Some representatives examined that they had indeed had the dependent thinking of "eyes looking upward (asking the central government) and reaching outward (transferring from other provinces)," and rarely considered how to develop local production and gradually achieve self-sufficiency. The main reason for the large backlog of canned goods was that this commodity was not regarded as a means of storing non-staple foods, but as a high-end consumer product, and it was developed in this direction, so the price was relatively high. There was also a serious official and lifeless atmosphere in the promotion work.

    On the basis of criticizing conservative ideas and clearly establishing a production perspective, a upsurge of comparing advanced experiences and competing for enthusiasm emerged at the meeting. Everyone wanted to compare who had more enthusiasm for developing production and who had more methods for promoting stockpiled commodities. Many representatives called back home overnight to discuss leap forward targets with relevant departments. They put forward slogans such as "Sugar beets go up the mountains, blooming everywhere," "Ten thousand catties of sugarcane per mu, one thousand catties of sugar," and "Self-sufficiency in two years, transfer out in three years." In addition, the Second Ministry of Commerce recently imported 1,000 tons of sugar beet seeds from abroad and ran training courses to help various places train technicians in local sugar extraction methods. Therefore, this year's sugar production target leaped again and again, increasing step by step. The original plan was 1.01 million tons, and finally it leaped to 1.61 million tons. Milk powder production also increased from 10 million pounds to 14 million pounds. Everyone also came up with many sales methods suitable for the needs of the masses for the slow-selling canned food.

    先谈政治　后谈业务
    糖业糕点专业会议解决了根本性问题
    据新华社21日讯　第二商业部最近用“先谈政治思想，后做买卖”的方法召开第三次全国糖业糕点专业会议，效果很好。这个部过去召开的专业会议，专门谈业务，由于大家思想不一致，缺乏整体观念，市场畅销的商品各地都想多要，滞销的商品都想少要，以致常常发生争执，最后虽加平衡，但不能从根本上解决问题。这次他们采取新的方法开会，不但解决了这个问题，而且推动了全国糖业糕点行业的工作大跃进。
    会议开始，就引导大家大鸣大放，出大字报，检查这个行业三种主要商品——食糖和奶制品长期脱销、罐头食品长期积压的主要原因，查思想根源。结合学习文件，大家对“打破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡”的问题有了正确认识，批判了“见物不见人”，忽视人的能动作用的保守思想，在上下之间、地区之间展开了热烈的批评和自我批评。
    这样，在开始谈业务之前，大家思想上就先取得一致。大家认识到，过去工作没有做好的关键，主要是生产观点、群众观点不强。对于市场供应不足的食糖和奶粉，长期没有从增产方面采取有效措施。在分配上，也存在机械平衡的观点。有些代表检查自己过去确实存在“两眼向上（向中央要），伸手向外（省外调入）”的依赖思想，很少考虑如何发展本地生产，逐步做到自给。罐头大量积压，主要原因是没有把这种商品作为副食品的储存手段，而是把它作为高级消费品，向这个方向发展，因此价格较高。在推销工作上，也存在着严重的官气暮气。
    在批判保守思想和明确树立生产观点的基础上，会议接着就出现了一个比先进比干劲的热潮。大家要比一比谁发展生产的干劲大，谁推销积压商品的办法多。许多代表连夜打电话回去同有关部门商量跃进指标。他们提出了“甜菜上山，遍地开花”，“亩产万斤蔗、千斤糖”，“两年自给、三年外调”等口号。加上第二商业部最近从国外进口了一千吨甜菜种子，并开办训练班帮助各地训练土法榨糖的技术人员，因此今年的食糖生产指标一跃再跃，步步提高。原计划是一百零一万吨，最后跃进到一百六十一万吨。奶粉的产量也由一千万磅增加到一千四百万磅。对于滞销的罐头，大家也想出许多适合群众需要的销售方法。
