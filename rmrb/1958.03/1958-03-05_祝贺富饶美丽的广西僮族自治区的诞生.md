    Congratulating the Birth of the Rich and Beautiful Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
    As the good news of the Great Leap Forward of the people across the country comes like snowflakes, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is declared established. This is not only a great happy event for the seven million and three thousand Zhuang people in Guangxi, not only a great happy event for the twelve million Han, Yao, Miao, Dong, Hui, Mulam, Maonan, Shui, Gelao, and Yi people in Guangxi, but also a great happy event for the people of the whole country.
    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with over 215,000 square kilometers of land and a population of over 19 million, is the third province-level autonomous region established in our country. The Zhuang nationality is the most populous minority nationality in our country. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is another great achievement in the implementation of our Party's nationality policy.
    Guangxi is a rich and beautiful place with crisscrossing rivers, continuous mountains, lush vegetation, and evergreen all year round. The scenery of Guilin, Yangshuo, and the Li River is known as "the best in the world." The region has fertile land and abundant rainfall, and is rich in more than 500 kinds of valuable local specialties such as tung oil, tea oil, nan bamboo, sugarcane, fruits, medicinal materials, and rubber. The region is rich in mineral resources, with 41 kinds of minerals such as iron, coal, tungsten, manganese, gold, tin, antimony, and aluminum. The northwest of the autonomous region is one of the famous timber production areas in our country.
    On this rich and beautiful land of Guangxi, the Zhuang, Han, and other fraternal nationalities live. They have lived and fought together for a long time, writing a glorious history with their common labor and struggle. Especially more than a hundred years ago, in order to oppose the feudal rule of the Qing Dynasty, the Han and Zhuang people jointly launched the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. In the subsequent democratic revolution, the people of all nationalities in Guangxi once again carried out heroic struggles against feudal warlords, against the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and against landlords and despots. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, the peasant movement in the Youjiang area of Guangxi was in full swing. One of its leaders was Comrade Wei Baqun, a loyal son of the Zhuang people, a revolutionary martyr, and an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the people of all nationalities in Guangxi established Soviet power in the Youjiang area, and established the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army. These troops fought bravely against the reactionary government troops at that time; later, they became a component of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, fighting across the motherland and establishing indelible merits for the people. At that time, some cadres stayed in Guangxi to continue the underground struggle and guerrilla warfare, which played a coordinating role in the liberation of the whole country and Guangxi. This long-term revolutionary struggle and common labor have established close economic and cultural ties between the people of all nationalities in Guangxi, and have cultivated a brotherly friendship. Now, the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will further enable the Zhuang people of Guangxi to gain the right to be masters of their own affairs, further enhance their political enthusiasm and the enthusiasm for production and construction; at the same time, it will further promote the common revolutionary tradition of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi, which is conducive to strengthening their unity and cooperation, and conducive to their mutual support and cooperation in economic and cultural construction. Whether from the perspective of Guangxi or the whole country, this is in line with the long-term interests of building socialism.
    The proposal to establish the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in October 1956. After this major proposal was put forward, it immediately received unanimous and warm support from the Zhuang people of Guangxi, and also received firm support from the people of other nationalities in Guangxi and the whole country. They realized that the Party Central Committee's proposal was in line with the interests of unity among the people of all nationalities in Guangxi and the whole country to jointly build socialism. Therefore, they are willing to use a positive attitude and practical actions to promote the rapid realization of this proposal. After a long period of deliberation, consultation, and preparation, this wish of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi has now been realized. This is a major victory for our Party and country in implementing the policy of national regional autonomy.
    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established on the basis of the tremendous construction achievements of Guangxi Province in the past eight years. Although "Guangxi is a good place, every mountain has treasures," its industry and agriculture have always been very backward. Taking Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, as an example, there were only three dilapidated small factories before liberation. The situation is very different now. Guangxi Province has 107 modern factories and mines (including 21 major reconstruction units) for non-ferrous metals, manganese mines, tin mines, electricity, machinery manufacturing, automobile repair, and sugar making. The total industrial output value (including handicrafts) has accounted for 32.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the region. The total industrial output value in 1957 increased eleven times compared with the initial period of liberation in 1950. In agriculture, the bad conditions of "flooding with rain and drought without rain" have been changed, and agricultural technology reforms have been carried out. Grain and other agricultural products have increased year by year. The province's grain output has increased from 7.2 billion jin before liberation to 10.8 billion jin. Culture has also developed greatly. The number of students in universities has increased by 25%, the number of middle school students has increased by 118%, and the number of elementary school students has increased by 32%. The Zhuang language was created after liberation. From April 1957 to now, in the 4,000 Zhuang townships, more than 350,000 Zhuang people are learning the Zhuang language, and about 100,000 people have learned the Zhuang language and have begun to get rid of illiteracy.
    After the anti-Rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification movement, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi has been high, and they are riding the wind and waves and forging ahead on the production and construction front like the people of the whole country. Since last winter, a climax of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and elimination of "four pests" has been set off in the whole region. Under the slogan of "hard struggle for three years to conquer the millennium drought," the people of the whole region have started construction of more than 120,000 large and small water conservancy projects, with an irrigation area of more than 12 million mu, exceeding the total irrigation area built in thousands of years. But they are not satisfied with the existing achievements. They want to continue to leap forward, and they have drawn a beautiful vision for themselves. In terms of industry and transportation, by 1963, the total output value of local industry (including handicrafts) will exceed the total output value of agriculture and sideline production, reaching 3.7 billion yuan, an increase of more than six times compared with 1957. By 1962, the mileage of roads open to traffic is required to reach 12,000 kilometers; by 1967, the waterways for barges throughout the region will increase to 3,000 kilometers. At that time, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will have industry in every county, postal service and telephones in every township, and better water and land transportation conditions. In agriculture, they are determined to strive to complete the ten-year target of 800 jin per mu per year six years ahead of schedule. By 1963, the total grain output of the region will leap to 24 billion jin, an increase of 122% compared with 1957. Within five years, the whole region will be basically greened, and this area will completely become a land of flowers and fruits. In terms of cultural, educational, and health undertakings, the "four pests" will be eliminated within five years, and literacy and other work will be vigorously carried out. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a huge driving force for promoting the Guangxi region to complete the Great Leap Forward plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.
    The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is taking place at a time when the minority nationalities across the country are carrying out rectification and socialist education movements. In order to further consolidate and strengthen the unity of the people of all nationalities in Guangxi and realize the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region must also continue to carry out rectification and socialist education among the minority nationalities, criticize great Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and currently should especially focus on opposing local nationalism.
    In celebrating the birth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, we hope that the people of all nationalities in Guangxi, especially the Zhuang and Han people, will join hands more closely in the future. The Zhuang people must earnestly respect the rights of other fraternal nationalities, especially the rights of the Han people, who have a larger population and greater political influence. The Han people should actively assist the Zhuang and other fraternal nationalities in exercising the right to regional autonomy, and give them strong support in economic and cultural construction. As long as the people of all nationalities in Guangxi highly promote this great spirit of unity and mutual assistance, they will certainly be able to do a better, faster, better, and more economical job in the various construction undertakings of the autonomous region, and make Guangxi an advanced national autonomous region in the country!

### 祝贺富饶美丽的广西僮族自治区的诞生

    祝贺富饶美丽的广西僮族自治区的诞生
    在全国人民大跃进的喜讯像雪片飞来的时候，广西僮族自治区宣告成立。这不只是广西七百万零三千僮族人民的大喜事，不只是广西一千二百万汉、瑶、苗、侗、回、仫佬、毛难、水家、倮倮、仡佬等十个民族的大喜事，也是全国人民的大喜事。
    拥有二十一万五千多平方公里土地、一千九百多万人口的广西僮族自治区，是我国建立的第三个省一级的自治区。僮族是我国少数民族中人口最多的民族。广西僮族自治区的成立，是我们党的民族政策贯彻执行的又一巨大成果。
    广西是一个富饶美丽的地方，境内河流纵横，丛山绵延，草木茂盛，四季常青。桂林、阳朔和漓江两岸的景色，素有“甲天下”之称。全区土地肥沃，雨量充沛，盛产桐油、茶油、楠竹、甘蔗、水果、药材、橡胶等五百多种有经济价值的土特产；区内矿藏丰富，有铁、煤、钨、锰、金、锡、锑、铝等四十一种矿产；自治区的西北部是我国有名的木材产地之一。
    在广西这块富饶美丽的土地上，居住着僮族、汉族和其他兄弟民族。他们长时期生活在一起，战斗在一起，用共同的劳动和斗争写下了光辉的历史。特别是在一百多年以前，为了反对清朝的封建统治，汉族和僮族人民曾经一起发动了太平天国的革命运动。在以后的民主主义革命中，广西的各族人民又在一起开展了反对封建军阀、反对蒋介石集团和反对地主恶霸的英勇斗争。在第一次国内革命战争时期，广西右江一带的农民运动搞得轰轰烈烈，它的领导人之一，就是僮族人民的忠诚子弟、革命先烈、中国共产党的优秀党员韦拔群同志。在第二次国内革命战争时期，广西各族人民在左右江一带建立了苏维埃政权，并且建立了红七军和红八军。这些军队，在当时同反动政府的军队进行了英勇的战斗；在以后又成为中国人民解放军的一个组成部分，转战在祖国各地，为人民建立了不可磨灭的功绩。当时有一部分干部留在广西，继续坚持地下斗争和游击战争，对全国和广西的解放起了配合作用。这个长期的革命斗争和共同的劳动，已经在广西各族人民之间建立起密切的经济和文化联系，已经培育起亲如兄弟的友情。现在广西僮族自治区的建立，将使广西的僮族人民进一步获得了当家作主的权利，更加提高他们的政治热情和生产建设的积极性；同时将进一步发扬广西各族人民共同的革命传统，有利于加强他们之间的团结合作，有利于他们在经济和文化建设上互相支援和配合。不论从广西或者全国来说，这都符合于建设社会主义的长远利益。
    建立广西僮族自治区的倡议，是中国共产党中央在1956年10月提出的。这一重大的倡议提出之后，立即得到广西僮族人民一致的热烈的拥护，也得到广西和全国其他民族人民的坚决支持。他们认识到，党中央的这一建议，是符合于广西和全国各族人民团结一致、共同建设社会主义的利益的。因此，他们都愿意用积极的态度和实际的行动，来促使这个建议的迅速实现。经过较长时期的酝酿、协商和筹备，广西各族人民的这个愿望现在实现了，这是我们的党和国家推行民族区域自治方针的一个重大胜利。
    广西僮族自治区是在广西省八年来巨大建设成绩的基础上建立起来的。虽然“广西是个好地方，个个山头有宝藏”，但是那里的工业和农业一直非常落后。以广西省会南宁来说，解放前只有三个残破的小厂。现在的情况大大不同，广西省出现了有色金属、锰矿、锡矿、电力、机器制造、汽车修配、制糖等现代化厂矿一百零七个（包括二十一个重大改建单位），工业总产值（包括手工业）已占全区工农业总产值的32.5％，1957年的工业总产值比解放初期的1950年增长了十一倍。在农业方面，已经改变了“一雨成涝，不雨即旱”的恶劣条件，进行了农业技术改革，粮食和其他农产品年年增长。全省粮食产量已由解放前的七十二亿斤增加到一百零八亿斤。文化也有很大的发展，高等学校的学生增加了25％，中学生增长了118％，小学生增长了32％。解放后创制了僮文，从1957年4月到现在，四千个僮族乡里，就有三十五万多僮族群众在学习僮文，大约有十万多人已学会了僮文，开始摆脱了文盲状态。
    经过反右派斗争和全民整风运动，广西各族人民的革命干劲高涨，同全国人民一样在生产建设战线上乘风破浪，奋勇前进。去冬以来，全区掀起了水利、积肥、造林、除“四害”运动的高潮。全区人民在“苦战三年，征服千年旱灾”的口号下，动工修建大小水利工程十二万多处，灌溉面积达一千二百多万亩，超过了几千年来兴修水利灌溉面积的总和。但是他们并不满足于已有的成绩，他们要继续跃进，他们给自己画出了一幅美丽的远景。在工业和交通运输方面，到1963年，地方工业（包括手工业）总产值就要超过农副业总产值，达到三十七亿元，比1957年增加六倍多。到1962年，公路通车里程要求达到一万二千公里；到1967年，全区通驳船的航道就要增加到三千公里。那时候，广西僮族自治区将县县有工业、乡乡通邮、通电话，也有更好的水陆运输条件。在农业方面，他们决心争取每年亩产八百斤的十年指标将提前六年完成。到1963年全区粮食总产量将跃进到二百四十亿斤，比1957年增加122％。五年内，全区基本绿化，这个地区就会完全成为花果之乡。在文教卫生事业方面，五年内消灭“四害”，大力开展扫盲和其他工作。广西僮族自治区的建立，对于促进广西地区提前超额完成大跃进的计划，是一个巨大的动力。
    广西僮族自治区的成立，正当全国少数民族进行整风和社会主义教育运动的时候。为了进一步巩固和加强广西各族人民的团结，实现社会主义建设的大跃进，广西僮族自治区也必须在少数民族中继续进行整风和社会主义教育，批判大民族主义和地方民族主义，当前尤其应当着重反对地方民族主义。
    在庆祝广西僮族自治区诞生的时候，我们希望广西的各族人民、特别是僮汉两族人民在今后更加亲密地携起手来。僮族人民要切实地尊重其他兄弟民族的权利，特别是要尊重人口较多和政治影响较大的汉族人民的权利。汉族人民应该积极协助僮族和其他兄弟民族行使区域自治的权利，在经济和文化建设上给予他们以大力的支援。只要广西的各族人民高度地发扬了这种团结互助的伟大精神，他们就一定能够把自治区的各项建设事业办得又多、又快、又好、又省，使广西在全国成为一个先进的民族自治区域！
