    Red-Crowned Crane
    Qiu Bingxing

    In the grassy marshes of western Heilongjiang, the snow-white red-crowned cranes migrate in pairs to nest and breed. In the spring months of March and April, the breeding season for the red-crowned cranes begins again.

    The gracefully standing, jade-like, and remarkably white-feathered red-crowned crane is often called the fairy crane. In Chinese folklore, the fairy crane is a precious animal symbolizing longevity and auspiciousness. Furthermore, because of its graceful posture and ease of domestication, it is often kept as a caged bird for viewing. Our country has repeatedly presented it as a valuable gift to our neighboring countries, the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and Japan.

    The adult red-crowned crane has mostly pure white feathers all over its body, with only the cheeks, throat, part of the neck, and part of the wing feathers being black. The top of its head has no feathers, revealing crimson skin, which contrasts with its snow-white plumage, making it appear particularly beautiful. Part of the black feathers on the red-crowned crane's wings are elongated and curved into an arc, covering the short, bare white tail feathers, often mistakenly thought to be its black tail feathers.

    The breeding area of the red-crowned crane once included the Ussuri River, Songhua River, and the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River in Northeast China. However, recent survey work has confirmed that their breeding area is now limited to a few areas in western Heilongjiang, China. The terrain there is low-lying, with reeds, cattails, and other vegetation growing luxuriantly. Almost every village is separated by muddy meadows. Inconvenient transportation and a sparse population make it an ideal place for birds like the red-crowned crane to nest and breed.

    The red-crowned cranes build their nests out of withered reeds and cattails on low-lying wetlands, laying two eggs per nest. Each egg can weigh more than half a catty (250 grams), and the shell surface is covered with dense reddish-brown spots. The adult cranes are very diligent in guarding the eggs and nests, not only staying close to the nest during the incubation period of about one month, but also remaining with the chicks day and night after they hatch, never flying high or far away. During their breeding season, every morning when the rising sun appears or in the evening when the sun sets, the adult cranes often stand in the slanting sunlight, sometimes raising their heads to gaze at the sky, and sometimes bending their necks to touch the ground with their long beaks, then spreading their wings, dancing and singing. Their loud calls can often be heard miles away, which cannot help but remind people of the phrase "The crane cries in the marshes, its voice is heard in the heavens."

    The red-crowned crane is good at flying high and also good at wading in shallows and shallow water. They often use their slender beaks to stir the shallow water or mud, searching for fish, shrimp, insects, or tender shoots of grass to fill their stomachs. Occasionally, some may enter farmland to peck at fallen grains or seeds, but the number is extremely small and not a cause for concern.

    In recent years, staff from zoos and parks in major cities have successively gone deep into the red-crowned crane's habitat to purchase adult cranes or newly hatched chicks, which has greatly encouraged the local farmers' enthusiasm for catching them, devising all sorts of ways to hunt. Even adult cranes that are in the process of nesting and breeding are often captured. Coupled with the local residents' habit of collecting the eggs of various waterfowl, the breeding numbers of this unique bird species in our country have declined year by year in recent years. Furthermore, due to the vigorous development of agriculture and large-scale land reclamation, the area of reed ponds and meadows where the red-crowned cranes nest and breed is constantly shrinking, which will force them to leave their original breeding environment and choose suitable new homes, and may even prevent them from breeding on our land altogether. In order to allow this unique bird to continue to breed on our beautiful land, we still need to do a lot of conservation work.

    丹顶鹤
    仇秉兴
    在黑龙江西部的草泽地带，那雪白的丹顶鹤成对地迁往那里营巢栖息。春季三、四月，丹顶鹤繁殖的季节又开始了。
    亭亭玉立、羽毛洁白丰硕的丹顶鹤，人们常称它为仙鹤。在我国民间，仙鹤是一种象征长寿和祥瑞的珍贵动物。又因为它姿态优美，易于饲养，所以常被养为笼禽供观赏。我国曾先后多次把它当作贵重的礼物送给我们的邻邦苏联、印度、缅甸和日本等国。
    成年的丹顶鹤，全身羽毛大部为纯白色，仅面颊、喉部、颈的一部分和翅膀的一部分羽毛为黑色。头顶上不生羽毛，露出朱红色的皮肤，同它全身雪白的羽毛相衬，显得格外美丽。丹顶鹤翅上的一部分黑色羽毛，延长而弯曲为弓状，遮盖在短秃的白色尾羽上，常被人误认为它的尾羽是黑色的。
    丹顶鹤的繁殖地区，过去曾包括我国东北的乌苏里江、松花江和黑龙江的中流一带。但是从最近几年的收集工作中证实：现在它们的繁殖地区仅限于我国黑龙江西部的少数地带了。那里地势低洼，芦苇、乌拉草等草木丛生，几乎每一个村庄之间都被泥泞的草甸相隔。交通不便，人口稀少，正是丹顶鹤等鸟群营巢繁殖的好地方。
    丹顶鹤以枯芦苇、乌拉草等营巢于低湿的草地上，每巢生二卵，每卵可重达半斤以上，壳面上密布着茶赤色的斑点。成鹤对卵和巢的守卫非常周密，不但在一个月左右的孵卵期中不离巢远去，就是在幼鹤出壳后，两只亲鹤仍然终日伴随着雏鹤，从不高飞或远离。在它们繁殖的季节里，每逢旭日东升的早晨或夕阳西下的傍晚，成鹤常常在斜射的阳光中，一会儿昂首仰望天空，一会儿又曲颈将长嘴触及地面然后展开双翅，且舞且鸣。它们这种嘹亮的鸣声，常常可以传到数里之外，不由得让人想到“鹤鸣九皋，声闻于天”的词句。
    丹顶鹤善于高飞，又善于涉游浅滩和浅水。它们常常用自己细长的嘴壳拨弄浅水或淤泥，觅食鱼、虾和昆虫或草类嫩芽充饥。个别的也偶入农田，啄食农作物的落粒或种子，但是为数极少，不足为患。
    近些年来各大城市的动物园和公园的工作人员，都先后深入丹顶鹤的产区收购成鹤或刚出壳的雏鹤，因而大大鼓舞了当地农民捕捉的积极性，想尽了各种办法进行捕猎。那怕是正在营巢繁殖期中的成鹤，也常被捕捉。再加上当地居民有拣食各种水鸟卵的习惯，因此近年来我国这种特产鸟类的繁殖数量已经逐年低落。更因为目前大力发展农业，大规模地开荒，使丹顶鹤进行营巢繁殖的地盘——苇塘和草甸不断缩小，这将会迫使它们远离原来的繁殖环境，另选适宜的新居，甚至有可能不再繁殖于我国的土地上。为了让这种特有鸟类继续在我们美丽的国土上繁殖，我们还需要作许多保护的工作。
