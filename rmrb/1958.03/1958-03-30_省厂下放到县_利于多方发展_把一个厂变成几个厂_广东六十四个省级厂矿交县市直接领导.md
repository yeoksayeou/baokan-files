    Provincial Factories Transferred to Counties Benefits Multiple Development
    Transforming One Factory into Several
    Guangdong Transfers Sixty-Four Provincial Factories and Mines to Direct Leadership of Counties and Cities
    (Our newspaper Guangzhou, March 29th dispatch) Guangdong Province recently transferred the management rights of sixty-four provincial factories and mines, changing them to direct leadership by counties and cities.

    The transfer of these factories has greatly promoted industrial leaps forward in various regions and unleashed the production potential of the factories. Relevant departments calculated the benefits for several sugarcane sugar factories after this transfer: Sugarcane sugar factories only produce for half the year, leaving machinery and equipment idle for the other half. Workers were only able to engage in machine maintenance. After being transferred to county management, each sugar factory, with a small additional investment, can be transformed into five factories. Namely, using bagasse to make paper; using unextracted sugarcane juice to make wine; using manpower and resources during downtime to repair machinery for the local area; and using power for agricultural product processing. Panyu County has already implemented this method in one sugar factory, with a preliminary estimate of only 30,000 yuan needed for investment. Currently, various regions are enthusiastically adopting this method of transforming one factory into several to develop local industry.

    Various regions will also utilize the advantageous conditions of the transferred factories, such as their larger scale and stronger technical capabilities, to better serve agricultural production. For example, utilizing the idle equipment and manpower of the transferred factories to process local agricultural products. The power spare parts, such as diesel engines, from sugar factories can also be used in water conservancy construction. Under the unified arrangement of the local area, some machinery factories can also concurrently undertake the repair and maintenance of local agricultural machinery and tools.

    In the past, when these factories were directly managed by the province, collaboration with other local factories was often poor. In the Hainan area, the Baimajing Shipyard had a backlog of masts, while the local shipbuilding industry had built hulls without masts (masts were allocated uniformly by the state), and they could not exchange what they had. Therefore, after transferring the management rights of these factories, it will be much easier for various regions to coordinate the relationship between the transferred factories and other factories than in the past. In addition, the transferred factories can also train workers for local small factories, or extract surplus technical strength to support other small factories.

    The provincial transportation department has a batch of repair and maintenance factories and service stations located in various places, but these factories used to have the situation of "going it alone" and underutilization. Now the transportation department has decided to conduct pilot projects for decentralization first. If it does not affect the timely operation of vehicles and ships, it will transfer the management rights of all its affiliated factories to counties and cities for unified local use.

    省厂下放到县　利于多方发展
    把一个厂变成几个厂
    广东六十四个省级厂矿交县市直接领导
    本报广州29日电　广东省最近把六十四个省级厂矿的管理权下放，改为县市直接领导。
    这些厂下放后，对促进各地工业跃进和发挥厂的生产潜力都有很大作用。有关部门为这次下放的好几个甘蔗糖厂算了一笔账：甘蔗糖厂的生产时间只有半年，每年有一半的时间机器设备要闲置起来，工人只好从事检修机器的工作。下放归县管理以后，每一个糖厂只要再加少量的投资，就可以变为五个厂。即利用蔗渣造纸；将未榨尽的甘蔗糖份造酒；在停机期间利用人力物力为地方修配机械；把动力用于农产品加工。番禺县有一个糖厂已经实行了这个办法，初步预计只要投资三万元。目前各地正兴致勃勃地采取这种以一个厂变几个厂的办法来发展地方工业。
    各地还将利用下放厂的规模较大、技术力量较充分的有利条件，更好地为农业生产服务。如利用下放厂的空余设备和人力为当地农产品加工。糖厂的动力备件柴油机，也可在兴修水利中加以利用。在当地统一安排下，有些机械厂还可兼做当地的农械和农具修配工作。
    这些厂过去由省直接管理时，往往与当地的其它工厂协作不好。海南地区的白马井造船厂船桅积压，而当地的造船业却造了船身没有船桅（桅木由国家统一分配），彼此不能互通有无。因此，把这些厂的管理权下放以后，各地在协调下放厂与别的厂之间的关系方面，将较过去方便很多。此外，下放厂还可以为地方小厂培养工人，或把剩余的技术力量抽出支援别的小厂。
    省交通部门有一批设在各地的修配厂和保养场，但这些厂过去有“单打一”和利用率不高的情况。现在交通部门已决定先进行下放试点，如果不影响车船的按时行驶，就将把全部所属工厂的管理权下放到县市，由地方统一使用。
