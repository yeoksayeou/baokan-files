    Strange Fish

    Fujian fishermen, fishing in Zhejiang waters, recently caught a strange fish. From its slender body, it looks like a ribbonfish, but its mouth is like that of a Chinese herring, and the shape of its entire head resembles that of a triggerfish. It also has many other peculiar features: the upper lip is slightly upturned and can be extended and shortened, the lower jaw is cartilage, and the mouth has no teeth. It is 2.52 meters long, silvery-white, and has many finger-sized, dull gray spots. There is a clear lateral line between the back and abdomen, and there are three particularly developed muscle ridges on each side of the body, with no scales. The skin is hard and has a peculiar fishy smell. Local aquatic product workers and local fishermen have never seen this kind of fish before.

    This strange fish was caught at the bottom of the sea, twenty-five fathoms deep, in the Yang'an East area of Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province. It has now been made into a specimen for academic research.

    怪鱼
    在浙江海面生产的福建省渔民最近捕到一条怪鱼。这条鱼从体态细长上看像带鱼，嘴却像鳓鱼，整个头部的形状又像三角鱼。它还有许多特奇的地方：上唇稍向上斜，可以伸长缩短，下颚系软骨，嘴上不长牙齿，身长二点五二公尺，呈银白色，有许多指印大小的灰暗色斑点。背与腹之间有条明显的侧线，身两侧各有三股特别发达的肌肉隆起、无鳞片。皮肤坚硬，气味奇腥。当地水产工作者也和当地渔民都从来没有见过这种鱼。
    这条怪鱼是在浙江省舟山洋鞍东二十五寻深的海水底层捕获的，现在已制成标本，供学术上研究。
