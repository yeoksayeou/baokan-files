Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Universities and colleges in the capital have entered a new phase of the rectification movement, focusing on combating waste and conservatism. In this phase, each school will first implement the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, engaging in diligent and thrifty production, and combining work and study. They will also conduct extensive debates on the fundamental path and basic methods of running schools, further establish a socialist educational line and method, reform the teaching system, improve the quality of teaching, and cultivate intellectuals who are both red and expert for the country in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

Most schools have seized on the link of developing production and organizing students for work-study programs, unveiling the prelude to this stage. Each school has made preliminary adjustments to the existing instruments and equipment on campus, uncovering a great deal of potential. The ten engineering colleges alone have more than 1,700 machine tools, some of which are rare even in Beijing, which can greatly supplement the shortcomings of local industrial production in Beijing. Relevant departments are now preparing to order a total output value of over 100 million yuan from the schools. Many schools have initially made plans for work-study programs based on their own characteristics and in conjunction with improving teaching. The planning characteristics of engineering colleges are "running both schools and factories," while the planning characteristics of social science and liberal arts colleges are "running both schools and farms." All schools are preparing to mobilize all available machines and land, making them a means for teachers and students to improve their thinking, master their skills, improve teaching, and increase wealth. The Beijing Institute of Technology is now producing boiler-towing machines and small machine tools in large quantities, and is preparing to adjust its existing equipment and organize two factories. The school initially plans to strive to produce 2.5 million to 3 million yuan of wealth for the country this year. The Institute of Geology and Exploration will also contract the geological survey and exploration tasks in the vicinity of Beijing. The Mining Institute has many large-scale equipment that used to lie idle for many years, but are now used to process train wheels. Tsinghua University, the Aviation Institute, and other schools have precise and complete equipment and are preparing to produce a large number of instruments. The concrete strain gauges first produced by the Aviation Institute during the winter vacation received very high evaluations for their quality. The Institute of Geology and Exploration and the Petroleum Institute have a small number of machine tools and are preparing to unite to form a factory. The Agricultural Mechanization Institute plans to carry out the repair of tractors and other agricultural machinery. Social science and language colleges are now also actively cooperating with agricultural production cooperatives. Renmin University of China has allocated all the open space on campus to students in preparation for spring plowing. Most schools have proposed using the open space on campus to produce vegetables to achieve self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency in non-staple foods for the entire school.

On February 26, the Higher Education Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the heads of the Party committees of the schools to make unified arrangements for the work of this stage. The meeting demanded that each school, on the basis of the great enthusiasm already shown by the masses for work-study programs, rapidly and further mobilize the masses to speak out freely and fully, and then launch debates on the main issues among them to comprehensively implement the "Three Diligences" and reform teaching. After the meeting, the schools immediately took action. After mobilization on the afternoon of February 28, the teachers and students of the University of International Business and Economics posted more than 2,000 big-character posters that evening. By the afternoon of March 1, the number of big-character posters had surged to 5,000. At the same time, teachers and students implemented the policy of combining production and education with practical actions, participating in labor in nearby factories, shops, and rural areas on Sunday, March 2, and establishing production contacts with all parties. The Central University for Nationalities not only used big-character posters to expose problems, but also held an anti-waste exhibition, displaying 210,000 yuan worth of stockpiled and wasted materials.

    把一切能利用的机器土地都调动起来
    首都高等学校反浪费反保守贯彻三勤
    据新华社2日讯　首都各高等学校整风运动已进入以反浪费、反保守为中心的新阶段。在这阶段里各校将首先贯彻勤俭办学、勤俭生产、勤工俭学的方针，并就办学的根本道路和基本方法进行大辩论，进一步确立社会主义的办学路线和方法，改革教学制度，提高教学质量，又多、又快、又好、又省地为国家培养又红又专的知识分子。
    多数学校都抓住发展生产、组织学生勤工俭学这一环，揭开了这一阶段的序幕。各校初步调整了校内现有的仪器设备，发掘出很多潜力。仅十个工科院校就有机床一千七百多台，有些机床在全北京市还是稀有的，这就可以大大补北京市地方工业生产上的不足。现在有关部门准备向各校订货的产值已达一亿元之多。不少学校都按自己的特点结合改进教学初步做出了勤工俭学的规划。工科院校的规划特点是“又办学校又办工厂”，社会科学和文科院校的规划特点是“又办学校又办农场”。各校都准备把一切可以利用的机器、土地调动起来，使之成为师生提高思想、掌握本领、改进教学、增加财富的手段。北京工业学院现在已经在大批生产锅驼机和小型机床，并准备把现有的设备加以调整，组织成两个工厂。全校初步计划争取在今年内为国家生产二百五十万元到三百万元的财富。地质勘探学院也将承包北京近郊的地质普查勘探任务。矿业学院有许多大型设备，过去常年睡觉，现在也用来加工火车轮子。清华、航空等校的设备既精密又齐全，准备生产大量的仪表。航空学院在寒假期内首先生产的混凝土应变计，质量获得了很高的评价。地质勘探学院、石油学院拥有机床数量较少，他们准备联合起来组成一个工厂。农业机械化学院计划进行拖拉机等农业机械的修理。社会科学和语文科院校现在也纷纷和农业生产合作社挂钩。中国人民大学已把全校校内的空地分配给学生准备春耕。多数学校都提出利用校址空地生产蔬菜，达到全校副食品自给或半自给。
    2月26日，中共北京市委高等学校委员会召集各校党委负责人对这一阶段的工作作了统一布置。会议要求各校在群众已经对勤工俭学表现了极大的积极性的基础上，迅速地进一步发动群众大鸣大放，然后就其中主要问题展开辩论，全面地贯彻“三勤”，改革教学。会后各校立即纷纷行动起来。对外贸易学院2月28日下午进行动员后，当天晚上师生们就贴出二千多张大字报，到3月1日下午大字报又激增到五千张。同时师生们又以实际行动贯彻生产与教育相结合的方针，3月2日利用星期天纷赴附近的工厂、商店、农村参加劳动，和各方面建立生产联系。中央民族学院不仅用大字报揭发问题，还举行了反浪费展览会，展出了积压和浪费的物资达二十一万元之多。
