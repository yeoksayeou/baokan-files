	Chasing and Capturing a Big Whale
	The fishermen of Aotou Port in Huiyang County, Guangdong, captured a large baleen whale weighing over 50,000 catties, sending the first good news of whale hunting in the South China Sea this year. On the morning of February 12th, Su Masheng, a member of the First Production Team of the Hezui Fishery Cooperative, discovered dazzling water columns, more than ten feet high, rising from the sea surface about ten nautical miles from Aotou Port. He immediately notified the entire team, and they sailed out to sea in four small sailboats to encircle and capture it. Seeing that they were only two zhang away from the whale's head, with a loud bang, the first shot severely wounded the whale. Then, aiming at the whale's head, they fired several shots in succession, and the enormous whale stopped moving.

    追捕大鲸
    广东惠阳县澳头港渔民捕获一条五万多斤重的大须鲸，发出了今年南海捕鲸的第一个捷报。2月12日早晨，鹤咀渔业社第一生产队队员苏马胜发现在离澳头港约十海浬的海面上，不时有一丈多高的耀眼的水柱喷起。他马上通知全队，驾着四艘小帆船出海围捕。眼看离开鲸鱼头部只有两丈多远了，轰的一声，头一炮就使鲸鱼受了重伤。接着，瞄准鱼头，又连续放了几炮，这条庞大的鲸鱼就不动了。
