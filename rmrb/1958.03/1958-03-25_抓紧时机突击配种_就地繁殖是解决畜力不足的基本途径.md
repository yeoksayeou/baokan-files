Report from our newspaper in Weinan, March 23rd: Reporter Wang Yong commented on the new situation in China's animal husbandry development, saying: With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural production, a high tide of animal husbandry production will also follow.

This year, due to the increase in cultivated land, the development of the fertilizer accumulation movement, the promotion of large-scale agricultural tools, the strengthening of intensive cultivation, and the increase in multiple cropping indexes in rural areas, the demand for animal power in agricultural production has greatly increased. The problem of the great development of livestock has been sharply raised.

Judging from China's actual situation, there are now more than 27 million mature female animals in the country, and the potential for breeding young animals is enormous. If they can all catch up with the livestock breeding speed of Weinan County, the number of large livestock can be rapidly increased.

At present, the conditions for promoting a great leap forward in animal husbandry production are ripe. The key lies in how to overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas. The main problems in livestock breeding at present are: First, some farmers simply wait for mechanization, thinking that livestock will have no future after mechanization, so they are unwilling to vigorously breed livestock. Such thinking and practices are obviously one-sided and wrong. Second, some farmers simply rely on purchases from other places and neglect self-breeding and local seed selection. In fact, the basic way to solve the shortage of animal power is still to rely on local breeding. Under the current necessary circumstances, it is also necessary to seize the work of inter-provincial and intra-provincial adjustments to solve the current urgent needs of areas lacking livestock. When breeding livestock, priority should be given to selecting and breeding local improved breeds. Simply emphasizing purebred improvement will inevitably affect the breeding speed. It is necessary to actively improve quality and gradually popularize and promote it while vigorously developing quantity.

    抓紧时机突击配种
    就地繁殖是解决畜力不足的基本途径
    本报渭南23日电　记者王永评述当前我国畜牧业发展的新形势说：随着农业生产高潮的到来，畜牧业生产高潮也将随之出现。
    今年各地农村由于水地增加，积肥运动开展，大型农具推广，精耕细作加强，复种指数提高，农业生产对畜力的要求大大增加。牲畜大发展的问题被尖锐地提出来了。
    从我国实际情况看来，现在全国共有适龄母畜二千七百多万头，繁殖幼畜的潜力很大，如果都能赶上渭南县的牲畜繁殖速度，那么大家畜的数量就能迅速地增长。
    现在，促进畜牧生产大跃进的条件已经成熟，关键在于如何克服各种右倾保守思想。当前牲畜繁殖上的主要问题是：一、有些农民单纯地等待机械化，他们以为机械化后牲畜就没有前途了，因而不愿大力繁殖牲畜。这种想法和做法显然都是片面的和错误的。二、有些农民单纯依靠外地购买，忽视自繁自养和就地选种。实际上，解决畜力不足的基本途径还要靠就地繁殖。在当前必要的情况下，也需要抓紧省际和省内的调剂工作，以解决缺畜地区当前紧迫的需要。在繁殖牲畜时首先应选育当地良种，单纯强调改良纯种，势必影响繁殖速度。必须在大力发展数量的同时，积极提高质量，逐渐普及推广。
