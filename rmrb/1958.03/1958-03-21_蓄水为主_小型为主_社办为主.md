After agricultural cooperativization, Jiyuan County and Meng County in Henan Province broke county boundaries and jointly and successfully managed the Mang River (a tributary of the Yellow River). Now, many regions are applying the experience of managing the Mang River. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided last December to adopt the same approach to manage the Shaying River, the tributary of the Huai River with the highest sand content. The floods and waterlogging caused by these two rivers affect nine counties in Henan and Anhui provinces. Managing them well will greatly benefit all nine counties. The Changwei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province also recently formulated a plan to manage the six river systems of the Wei River, Jiao-Lai River, Bailang River, Er River, Zi River, and Chao River, deciding to "basically change the face of the area in three years and completely manage the rivers in the entire area in five years." In mid-January of this year, the Jinnan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province convened a meeting of county party secretaries from Wenxi County and seven other counties, deciding to basically manage the Su River well within three years. The Yanbei area of Shanxi Province recently established a committee for managing the Hun River, directly led by the Prefectural Committee Secretary, deciding that all management projects for the main stream of the Hun River flowing through Hunyuan County and Ying County and the eight major valleys should be "completed in two years and finished up in three years." Other regions are also doing similar things.

This large-scale mass water management movement jointly undertaken by several regions marks a new development in China's water conservancy construction and the beginning of a new life history for countless small rivers throughout the country. That is to say, thousands of small rivers will no longer be a blind force that rises and falls violently and is unmanaged, harming the people, but will more and more be tamed to flow in a controlled manner according to the will of the people, benefiting the people.

Henan Province has determined three guidelines for managing the Shaying River: First, focus on water storage, and after meeting the needs of the entire basin for water, make appropriate drainage; second, focus on small-scale projects, supplemented by necessary medium-sized projects; third, small-scale projects are entirely managed by agricultural cooperatives themselves, with the state providing necessary support in particularly difficult areas; medium-sized projects are mainly managed by the community, with the state providing necessary subsidies. Other regions also basically adopt this guideline in managing small and medium-sized rivers.

Focusing on water storage is a major shift in mass water management. For thousands of years, people have had a fear of water. Every rainy season, farmers along rivers in plains and low-lying areas often worriedly blocked and drained water, fearing that water would remain in their areas and cause disasters, destroying farmland and homes. The upstream desperately blocked water, and the downstream desperately drained water, with each acting in their own interest at the expense of their neighbors, and the result was that everyone suffered. After liberation, the government proposed a policy of combining storage and drainage, and water management work in plains and low-lying areas has achieved great results. However, due to the limitations of socio-economic conditions, insufficient water management experience, and other reasons, water disputes between neighboring regions still occur every year. In the future, if we can comprehensively plan and take overall consideration from mountaintops to foothills, from mountainous and hilly areas to plains, from plains to low-lying areas, from the source to the estuary, and various projects cooperate with each other, each region should first try to store as much rainwater as possible and make as much use of it as possible. This can eliminate or greatly reduce the disasters of floods and waterlogging. From trying to drain and block water to trying to store and use water, this is a transformation. This transformation reflects the rapid development and improvement of the Chinese working people's ability to control water.

What method should be used to store water? Should we mainly rely on large-scale projects, or medium-sized or small-scale projects? The definite answer is: we should focus on small-scale projects. No one doubts that using small-scale projects for general farmland water conservancy will bring great benefits. However, some people still doubt the effectiveness of using small-scale projects to manage rivers. On this issue, it is best to let the facts answer. Henan Province's comprehensive management of the Mang River began on a large scale in the winter of 1955. After two winters, more than three-quarters of the total project volume was completed, and results were quickly achieved: In the flood season of 1953, the rainfall was 540 mm, and the Mang River flood flow was 500 cubic meters per second, inundating 120,000 mu of cultivated land. In the flood season of 1957, the rainfall in Jiyuan was 560 mm, and the Mang River only had a flow of 70 cubic meters per second, reducing the flood flow by 86%. Because the Mang River basin basically eliminated water and drought disasters, agricultural production in Meng County and Jiyuan County increased significantly. Looking at the experience of several key water and soil conservation areas in the Shaying River basin, the water management effects of various small-scale projects (small reservoirs, gully dams, fish-scale pits, interception ditches, contour trenches, field ridges, etc.) are also certain. The water and soil conservation projects (small-scale projects) in Yuxian County, Jia County, and Lushan County in the Shaying River basin have basically achieved the requirement that water and soil do not leave the mountains after the test of heavy rain during the 1957 flood season. Except for a few places, under a rainfall of 200 mm, soil erosion and sediment transport to the downstream will not occur. This shows that as long as various small-scale projects are built in a manner appropriate to local conditions throughout the Shaying River basin, floods, waterlogging, and drought can basically be eliminated. Of course, small-scale projects are difficult to cope with particularly large floods, so a few large-scale projects should still be built under possible conditions; but we must not therefore ignore the function of small-scale projects. Countless facts have proved that although small-scale projects are small in scale, they can be built in large numbers everywhere, so they control a very wide area; while the area controlled by a few large-scale projects is limited. Only by combining a few large-scale projects with a large number of small-scale projects can they complement each other and achieve greater results. At the same time, it should also be seen that by relying on thousands of small-scale projects to manage small rivers well, it will be easier to eradicate the water disasters of large rivers.

Since the management of small rivers focuses on small-scale projects, the management projects must mainly rely on agricultural cooperatives. Because each county needs to do thousands or tens of thousands of small-scale water conservancy projects, it is necessary to mobilize the masses of farmers to contribute manpower, money, materials, and ideas. The places that have successfully managed water in the past few years have done just that. Experience in various places has proved that relying on the masses to build water conservancy projects can also save expenses and avoid waste. Before July 1957, Jia County, Henan Province, had built a total of 65 reservoirs, 64 of which were built by the masses themselves, with the state only providing very little subsidies. The Shantou Zhao Reservoir can store 2.15 million cubic meters of water and cost a total of 116,000 yuan (of which the state only subsidized 25,000 yuan), with an average of more than 18 cubic meters of water per yuan. However, the Lan River Reservoir, which was completely built by the state, had an average state investment of less than 5 cubic meters of water per yuan. Because this reservoir built by the state was not protected by the masses, it was later washed away by mountain floods, while the farmers protected the reservoirs built by themselves very well. The people who guard the reservoirs also use the reservoirs to develop sideline production. Now, the enthusiasm of the farmers in this county to build reservoirs is getting higher and higher, and the county will build another 80 small reservoirs this winter and next spring. Is this fact not enough to prove the correctness of the policy of "community-run as the main approach"?

To encourage millions of farmers to contribute a large amount of manpower, materials, and financial resources to effectively manage small rivers, there must be a material foundation, that is, to closely combine the long-term interests and current interests of the masses. Specifically, it is necessary to comprehensively utilize various water conservancy projects, comprehensively develop production, combine water and soil conservation, flood control, drainage, and development of irrigation, and comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries. In fact, as long as the above three guidelines are earnestly implemented and the mass line is resolutely followed, this can be completely achieved. For example, a fish-scale pit on a hillside can store water, plant trees, and grow melons and beans, achieving three benefits in one fell swoop, benefiting in the same year. The use of reservoirs is even more extensive. Eleven of the twelve townships in Jia County, Henan Province, have reservoirs, and "grape bunch" style reservoir groups have appeared throughout the county, and the farmers have obtained great benefits from the reservoirs. The masses summarized the benefits of building reservoirs as: "Irrigation increases production; flood control reduces disasters; power generation and lighting; fish farming for meat; saving labor; facilitating laundry; benefiting well digging; greening barren mountains; changing good farmland; providing hydrological data for managing large rivers..." Many water and soil conservation projects built by farmers in mountainous areas of Yuxian County, Henan Province, closely combine current production, and the benefits in the same year exceeded the project cost in the same year.

The management of a river is related to many regions and the interests of millions of people. Formulating a basin plan requires collecting a large amount of natural data and socio-economic data, taking into account the interests and requirements of various regions, and determining the correct management guidelines and methods. In the process of water management, a series of political and organizational work must also be done well. Such an arduous and complex task can only be successfully completed under the direct leadership of party committees at all levels. The river management work that has recently begun in various places is led and directed by the first secretaries of the party committees. This is absolutely necessary.

Large-scale mass water management movements require strong support and cooperation from various departments. The engineering tasks in various places this year are generally increased by one or two times, or even three or four times, compared with last year, while the technical level and experience of the masses are not high enough. This requires the water conservancy department to provide more assistance in terms of technology. This is especially important to ensure the quality of water conservancy projects. The development of the mass water management movement also raises many new questions for scientific research institutions. For example, after a large number of water conservancy projects are built and the policy of focusing on storage is implemented, what changes will occur in the water level and flow, groundwater level, soil composition, and sediment content of the river? What kind of laws do they have? These require scientific and technological workers to conduct serious research in order to better control and utilize water resources, develop production, and promote construction. The new experiences and new technologies continuously created by the broad masses in the water management movement also need scientists to summarize and improve them theoretically. We believe that scientists will be happy to accept such a glorious task that is beneficial to the people.

    蓄水为主　小型为主　社办为主
    河南省的济源县和孟县在农业合作化以后，打破县界，联合行动，成功地共同治理了漭河（黄河支流）。现在，许多地区都在运用治理漭河的经验。中共河南省委在去年12月已经决定采取同样做法来治理淮河支流中含沙量最大的沙颍河。这两条河造成的洪水和涝灾，遍及河南、安徽两省的九个县。治理好了，对九县都有很大好处。中共山东省昌潍地委不久以前也订出了治理潍河、胶莱河、白浪河、洱河、淄河、潮河六个水系的规划，决定“三年基本改变面貌，五年治好全区河流”。今年1月中旬，中共山西省晋南地委召开了闻喜县等七县县委书记会议，决定三年内基本上把涑河治好。山西省雁北地区最近成立了由地委书记直接领导的治理浑河委员会，决定流经浑源县、应县的浑河主流和八个大峪的全部治理工程要“二年完成，三年扫尾”。还有一些地区也在做着类似的事情。
    这样大规模的几个地区联合进行的群众性治水运动，标志着我国水利建设事业的新发展，标志着遍布祖国各地无数条小河流的新的生命史的开始。就是说，成千上万条小河流将不再作为一种暴涨暴落、无人驾驭的盲目力量为害人民，而将越来越驯服地按照人民的意志有节制地流动，造福于人民。
    河南省已经确定了治理沙颍河的三条方针：一、以蓄水为主，在满足全流域对于水的需要之后，作适当的排泄；二、以小型工程为主，辅之以必要的中型工程；三、小型工程全部由农业合作社自办，在特别困难的地区，国家给以必要的支持；中型工程以社办为主，国家给以必要的补助。其他地区在治理中小河流上，也基本上采取了这个方针。
    以蓄水为主，这是群众性治水事业的一个重大转变。几千年来，人们对水都存有恐惧心理。每到雨季，平原地区和低洼地区的沿河农民常常提心吊胆地去堵水排水，惟恐水留在自己的地区酿成灾害，毁坏农田和家园。对上游是拼命地堵，对下游是拼命地排，你排我堵，以邻为壑，各顾自己，而结果是大家受害。解放后，政府提出蓄泄兼顾的方针，平原、洼地的治水工作收到很大成效。但是，由于社会经济条件的限制和治水经验的不足以及其他原因，毗邻地区之间的水利纠纷仍然年年发生。今后如果能从山头到山脚，从山区、丘陵区到平原，从平原到洼地，从发源地到河口，全面规划，统筹兼顾，各种各样的工程互相配合，每个地区都首先尽量把雨水蓄起来，尽量加以利用。这样就可以消除或者大大减轻洪水和内涝的灾害。从尽量排水堵水到尽量蓄水用水，这是一个转变。这个转变反映了中国劳动人民控制水的能力在迅速发展和提高。
    用什么方法来蓄水呢？主要依靠大型工程，还是中型或小型工程呢？肯定的回答是：应当以小型工程为主。把小型工程用于一般农田水利，会得到很大的效益，这已经没有人怀疑了。但是，把小型工程用来治理河流，还有人怀疑它的效果。关于这一问题，最好还是让事实来回答。河南省的漭河从1955年冬季开始大规模的综合治理，经过两个冬季，完成了总工程量的四分之三以上，很快就收到了效果：1953年汛期，雨量是五百四十公厘，漭河洪水流量是五百秒公方，有十二万亩耕地受淹。1957年汛期，济源降雨量五百六十公厘，漭河只出现了七十秒公方的流量，洪水流量被削减了86％。由于漭河流域基本上消除了水旱灾害，孟县、济源县农业都显著增产。再从沙颍河流域若干个水土保持重点地区的经验看，多种多样的小型工程（小水库、谷坊、鱼鳞坑、截水沟、水平沟、地埂等等）的治水效果，也是肯定的。沙颍河流域禹县、郏县、鲁山县的水土保持工程（小型工程）经过1957年汛期暴雨的考验，基本上达到了水土不下山的要求。除个别地方外，在一次降雨量二百公厘的情况下，不致发生水土冲刷，向下游输送泥沙。这就说明，只要整个沙颍河流域都因地制宜地修上各种小型工程，就可以基本上消除洪、涝、旱灾。当然，小型工程对于抗御特大洪水是难以胜任的，因此在可能的条件下还是应当建设少数大型工程；但是决不可因此忽视小型工程的功用。无数的事实已经证明小型工程虽然规模小，但是到处可以大量修建，因此它们控制的面很广大；而少数的大型工程所能控制的流域面积却是有限的。只有把少数大型工程和大量的小型工程配合起来，它们才会相得益彰，收效更大。同时还要看到，依靠成千上万的小型工程治理好了小河流，根除大河流的水患也就容易了。
    小河流的治理既然以小型工程为主，那么治理工程就必须主要依靠农业合作社来办。因为小型水利工程每个县都要做几千几万个，必须发动农民群众有人出人，有钱出钱，有料出料，有计献计。几年来凡是治水成功的地方，正是这样做的。各地的经验证明：依靠群众兴办水利工程，还可以节约经费，避免浪费。河南省郏县1957年7月以前，共建成六十五座水库，其中六十四座是群众自办的，国家只给了很少的补助。山头赵水库可蓄水二百一十五万方，共用去十一万六千元（其中国家只补助二万五千元），每元平均十八方多水。但是完全由国家办的蓝河水库，国家投资平均每元还不到五方水。国家办的这座水库因为没有受群众保护，后来被山洪冲垮了，而农民群众对于自办的水库却保护得很好。看水库的人还利用水库发展副业生产。现在，这个县的农民兴修水库的积极性越来越高，全县在去冬今春将再兴建八十座小水库。这个事实还不足以证明“以社办为主”的方针的正确性吗？
    要鼓励千百万农民拿出大量的人力物力财力来有效地治理小河流，必须有一个物质基础，就是使群众的长远利益和当前利益密切结合。具体地说，就是要综合利用各种水利工程，全面发展生产，把水土保持、防洪、排涝、发展灌溉结合起来，把农、林、牧、副业全面发展起来。事实上，只要认真贯彻上述三条方针，坚决走群众路线，是完全可以做到这点的。比如山坡上的一个鱼鳞坑，就又可蓄水，又可栽树和种瓜豆，一举三得，当年受益。水库的用途更广泛。河南郏县十二个乡，有十一个乡有水库，全县已经出现了“葡萄串”式的水库群，农民从水库得到了很大的收益。群众总结兴修水库的好处是：“灌溉增产；拦洪减灾；发电照明；养鱼吃肉；节省劳力；便利洗衣；有利打井；绿化荒山；改变良田；供给治理大河水文资料……”河南省禹县山区农民兴办的许多水土保持工程，由于密切结合当前生产，当年收益就超过了当年工程成本。
    一条河流的治理，关系许多地区，关系千百万人民的利益。制订一个流域规划，需要搜集大量的自然资料和社会经济资料，需要兼顾各类地区的利益和要求，需要确定正确的治理方针和方法。在治水工程进行过程中，还必须做好一系列的政治工作和组织工作。这样艰巨、复杂的任务，只有在各级党委的直接领导之下才能胜利完成。最近各地开始的治理河流的工作，都由党委第一书记亲自挂帅，统一指挥。这是完全必要的。
    大规模的群众性治水运动，需要各个部门的有力支援和配合。今年各地的工程任务一般都比去年增加一两倍，甚至三四倍，而群众的技术水平还不高，经验也不足。这就要求水利部门在技术方面给予更多的帮助。这对于保证水利工程的质量尤其重要。群众治水运动的发展，给科学研究机关也提出很多新问题。比如，在大量修水利工程、实行以蓄为主的方针以后，河流的水位和流量、地下水位、土壤成分、河水含沙量等等，会发生什么变化？具有什么样的规律？这些都需要科学技术工作者认真研究，以便更好地控制和利用水利资源，来发展生产，推进建设。广大群众在治水运动中不断地创造出新的经验新的技术，也需要科学家们从理论上加以总结和提高。我们相信科学家们将乐于接受这样的有益于人民的光荣任务。
