Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In the past two or three days, opinions from various countries have welcomed the new proposal put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko in his letter to French Foreign Minister Pineau to promote a summit conference.

    The Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" published an editorial on the 5th, saying that the new step taken by the Soviet Union will undoubtedly promote the preparation of the summit conference. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union has in fact agreed to the demands made by the West. Now the question is whether the Western governments will refrain from backing down from their own demands, as has often happened in the past.

    The East German "Neues Deutschland" emphasized on the 4th that Gromyko suggested in his letter that the heads of government conference should only discuss issues that are more likely to reach an agreement. The issue of German reunification is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves and should not be entangled with the issue of a non-nuclear zone.

    The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote in a commentary published on the 5th that Western countries have raised some serious reservations about Gromyko's proposal. The newspaper said that we can clearly see the methods being used by Western countries: as soon as the Soviet Union agrees to their proposals, they withdraw them again. The newspaper pointed out, when commenting on the views of Western politicians such as Dulles on Gromyko's proposal, that the change in the Western attitude is very surprising compared to some of the initial positive reactions to the Soviet actions. Such an attitude will not help to convene a conference that could improve the international atmosphere and ease the current tension.

    Commentaries published in Romanian newspapers believe that the new Soviet proposal is a new step forward on the road to East-West talks. "Spark Newspaper" pointed out on the 5th that the idea of ​​holding a summit conference has gained tremendous repercussions and is becoming the ardent demand of the broad masses of people around the world.

    The Yugoslavian "Politika" emphasized on the 4th that considering that the preparation for the summit conference has been hindered by procedural issues for several weeks, the recent letter from the Soviet Union is an encouraging sign. This is a step forward, a very meaningful step. The newspaper's commentator wrote that the Soviet Union's decision to hold a preparatory meeting at the ministerial level has promoted the preparation of the summit conference.

    The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 5th welcoming the new Soviet proposal to convene a foreign ministers' meeting to prepare for the summit conference, believing that this is "an important step" towards achieving the summit conference.

    The "People's Daily" also pointed out that the foreign ministers' meeting proposed in the new Soviet proposal is different from the foreign ministers' meeting that Eisenhower had previously insisted on. The purpose of the foreign ministers' meeting proposed by the Soviet Union is only to prepare for the summit conference, and the work of the foreign ministers' meeting should only be limited to discussing the agenda of the summit conference and the issue of participating member states.

    The West German Social Democratic Party's "Social Democratic News Bulletin" published an article on the 4th regarding the new Soviet proposal, demanding that the Adenauer government not be a "stumbling block" to convening a summit conference.

    The bulletin emphasized: "Only when the East and West establish a minimum of normal relations through disarmament and easing of tensions—the most important part of which is Poland's plan to establish a non-nuclear weapons zone in Central Europe—will the division of Germany be possible to eliminate. Whoever does not want to see this simple truth must do something "stupid or evil."

    Indonesian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Suwito expressed welcome to the Soviet government's proposal to convene a foreign ministers' meeting when speaking to reporters on the 3rd.

    The Egyptian "People's Daily" welcomed the Soviet Union's agreement to hold a foreign ministers' meeting before the East-West summit conference, believing that "this is another concession made by the Soviet Union to the West and another step taken to convene the summit conference as soon as possible."

    The newspaper said: "The Soviet Union's attitude is very correct, and world public opinion attaches importance to the sincere efforts made by the Soviet Union for the cause of mankind and peace."

    The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" published a commentary welcoming the Soviet government's proposal to hold a foreign ministers' meeting to prepare for the summit conference. The commentary said that the proposal to convene a summit conference was put forward by the Soviet Union. "Soviet leaders say they are against war, and this should be believed. Soviet leaders are concerned about easing international tensions and maintaining lasting peace." The newspaper said that since the Soviet Union has agreed to hold a foreign ministers' meeting, the West cannot but agree to develop this negotiation into a summit conference.

### 苏联新建议受普遍欢迎  各国舆论要求西方别再作梗

    苏联新建议受普遍欢迎
    各国舆论要求西方别再作梗
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：近两三天，各国舆论对苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在给法国外交部长比诺的信中为促进最高级会议所提出的新建议表示欢迎。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”5日发表的社论说，苏联这次采取的新步骤无疑将促进最高级会议的准备工作。报纸指出，苏联事实上已经同意了西方提出的要求，现在问题就在于西方政府不要从它们自己的要求后退，像过去常常发生的那样。
    民主德国的“新德意志报”4日强调指出，葛罗米柯在信中建议各国政府首脑会议只讨论那些比较有把握可以达成协议的问题。德国统一的问题首先就是德国人自己的问题，不能把它和关于无原子地区的问题纠缠在一起。
    波兰“人民论坛报”在5日发表的一篇评论中写道，西方国家已经对葛罗米柯的建议提出若干严重的保留意见。这家报纸说，我们可以清楚地看到西方国家正在使用的方法：只要苏联一同意它们的建议，它们就又撤回它们的建议。这家报纸在评论杜勒斯等西方政客对葛罗米柯的建议的意见时指出，同最先对于苏联的行动作出的一些正面反应对比起来看，西方态度的变化令人非常惊异。这样一种态度不会有助于召开一次可能改善国际气氛和缓和目前紧张局势的会议。
    罗马尼亚各报发表的评论认为，苏联的新建议是在东西方会谈的道路上迈进了新的一步。“火花报”5日指出，召开最高级会议的思想已经获得巨大的反响，它正在成为全世界广大群众的热烈要求。
    南斯拉夫“政治报”4日强调说，考虑到几星期来最高级会议的准备工作由于程序问题而受到了妨碍，苏联最近发出的信是令人振奋的迹象。这是前进了一步，很有意义的一步。这家报纸的评论员写道，苏联同意举行部长级预备会议的决定促进了最高级会议的准备工作。
    越南“人民报”5日发表社论欢迎苏联关于召开外长会议来准备政府首脑会议的新建议，认为这是促成政府首脑会议的“一个重要步骤”。
    “人民报”还指出，苏联新建议中提出的外长会议是同艾森豪威尔在这以前坚持的外长会议有所区别的。苏联建议的外长会议的目的只是为了准备政府首脑会议，外长会议的工作也只应该限于讨论政府首脑会议的议程和参加成员国问题。
    西德社会民主党的“社会民主新闻公报”4日就苏联的新建议发表文章，要求阿登纳政府不要做召开最高级会议的“绊脚石”。
    公报强调指出：“只有东西方通过裁军和缓和紧张局势——其中最重要的部分是波兰关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的计划——来建立最低限度的正常关系，德国的分裂状况才有可能消除。谁不想看到这个简单的真理，他就要做出“蠢事或恶事。”
    印度尼西亚外交部秘书长苏维托3日在对新闻记者发表谈话时，表示欢迎苏联政府提出的关于召开外长会议的建议。
    埃及“人民报”欢迎苏联同意在东西方最高级会议之前举行外长会议，认为“这是苏联对西方作出的又一让步和为了早日召开最高级会议而作出的另一步骤”。
    这家报纸说：“苏联的态度是非常正确的，世界舆论都重视苏联为了人类和和平的事业而作出的真诚努力。”
    日本“朝日新闻”发表评论，对苏联政府提出举行外长会议来准备最高级会议的建议表示欢迎。评论说，关于召开最高级会议的建议是苏联提出的。“苏联领导人说，他们反对战争，这话是应当相信的。苏联领导人关心缓和国际紧张局势和维护持久和平。”这家报纸说，既然苏联已经同意举行外长会议，那么西方就不能不同意把这种谈判发展成最高级会议了。
