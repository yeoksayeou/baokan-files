Three Wheat Strains Overtake Rice; Rice Yield Doubled
Twenty-Three Townships in Changshu Launch Summer and Autumn Crop Production Increase Competition

(Our dispatch) The Party committees of twenty-three townships including Nanfeng Township in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, recently proposed the slogan of realizing "Three wheat strains overtake rice, rice yield doubled" in 1958 in order to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of three wheat strains and rice. The specific targets are: "1,000 catties of rice, 500 catties of wheat, and 200 catties of ginned cotton."

In order to achieve this goal, the specific measures they proposed are:

(1) Completely eliminate drought and flood disasters. Drain water from the bottom fields to achieve small ditches connected to large ditches, large ditches connected to rivers, and ensure that they are not flooded even with 300 millimeters of rain in three days. Prevent drought in high fields, ensuring that they are not affected by drought even without rain for seventy days. Defend against typhoons and floods along the Yangtze River, strengthen and repair river embankments and sea dikes to ensure that there are no risks from magnitude twelve typhoons and once-in-a-century major floods.

(2) Vigorously collect natural fertilizers, achieving 1,000 dan of fertilizer applied per mu, and green manure reaching a yield of 9,000 catties per mu.

(3) Prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Conduct six drug preventions for both summer and autumn crops. Prevent immediately upon seeing insects, and basically eliminate the ten major insect pests.

(4) Continue to improve the "three guarantees and one reward" system, and fully implement "four fixings to the fields" and "knowing a year in advance."

(5) Promote advanced cultivation techniques. Implement intensive farming and careful cultivation, select good varieties, deep plow the autumn ripe fields twice, implement close planting, and increase the number of plants per unit area.

Recently, the Party committees of these twenty-three townships also proposed this to all brother townships in the province as an initiative for high-yield competition, promoting a further leap forward in this year's summer and autumn crops throughout the province.

    三麦赶水稻　水稻翻一翻
    常熟二十三个乡提出夏秋作物增产竞赛
    本报讯　江苏省常熟县南丰等二十三个乡党委，为了争取三麦和水稻全面大丰收，最近提出了1958年实现“三麦赶水稻，水稻翻一翻”的口号，具体指标是：“稻一千，麦五百，皮棉收二百”。
    为了实现这个指标，他们提出的具体措施是：
    （一）彻底消灭旱涝灾害。底田排涝，达到小沟通大沟，大沟通河道，三天下雨三百公厘，保证不受涝。高田防旱，达到七十天不下雨不受旱。沿江抗台防洪，培修江堤海塘，保证十二级台风和百年一遇的大汛不出险。
    （二）大力积集自然肥料，达到每亩施肥千担，绿肥每亩产量达到九千斤。
    （三）防治病虫害，夏秋两熟进行六次药剂预防，见虫即防，基本消灭十大虫害。
    （四）继续搞好“三包一奖”，全面推行“四定到田，和“一年早知道”。
    （五）推广先进耕作技术。实行精耕细作，选用良种，秋熟田深耕二次，实行密植，增加单位面积株数。
    最近，这二十三个乡党委又以此向全省各兄弟乡提出了高额丰产竞赛倡议，促进全省今年的夏、秋两熟作物再大跳一步。
