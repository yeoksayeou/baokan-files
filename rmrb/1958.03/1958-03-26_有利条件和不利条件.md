    Favorable Conditions and Unfavorable Conditions
    Zhong Yin
    The many vivid facts in this Great Leap Forward in production and construction have prompted people to have a new understanding of the issue of overcoming difficult conditions.
    In the past, we always heard some people defending the backwardness of their work by saying that this was because there were some insurmountable difficult conditions there; while the reason why work was advanced in other places was because there were no such difficult conditions there, and there were some particularly favorable conditions. The implication was that the backwardness of their work was a matter of course.
    However, since the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country arrived, we have rarely heard such discussions. With the changes in the objective situation, people's thinking has also changed. In the past, people emphasized objective difficulties, but now they emphasize subjective efforts to overcome difficult conditions. Now, people no longer believe that objective difficult conditions can prevent people from moving forward, and no longer believe that there are any difficulties that people's efforts cannot overcome.
    As a result, a leap change has taken place in our work. What was considered impossible in the past is now possible; what was considered to be done slowly in the past can now be done quickly.
    Barren mountainous areas were once considered to have extremely difficult conditions and were simply unable to achieve high yields, but it has now been proven that low-yield land can be completely transformed into high-yield land. The historically famous low-yield area of ​​the Shaanxi-North mountainous area saw large areas of high-yield fields in 1957, reaching high yields of 400, 1,000, and even more than 2,000 catties per mu.
    Implementing water conservancy in mountainous areas was also originally considered impossible, but Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province accomplished this in just one or two months.
    Why have these things that seemed impossible in the past suddenly become possible today? The reason is that they relied on favorable conditions and overcame unfavorable conditions.
    Everything is a unity of opposites. We must also understand favorable and unfavorable conditions in the development process of things in this way. No matter what, in their development process, they always contain both favorable and unfavorable conditions. There is no such thing as only favorable conditions and no unfavorable conditions; there is also no such thing as only unfavorable conditions and no favorable conditions. The two always coexist and are intertwined and mutually influence each other. Things develop forward under these contradictory conditions.
    The responsibility of us revolutionaries is to strive to overcome unfavorable conditions and develop favorable conditions, to help and promote the rapid development of new things.
    Therefore, for us revolutionaries, the question is not whether difficult conditions exist, but how people treat these difficult conditions. It is precisely on this issue that promoters and regressives hold completely different attitudes.
    When regressives look at everything, they always emphasize that the objective conditions are not good. Their eyes are only on unfavorable conditions, and they do not see or cannot see favorable conditions. They do not even understand that they can use favorable conditions to change unfavorable conditions. They are always frowning, sighing, and at a loss in the face of difficulties, exaggerating the difficulties to an insurmountable degree. Therefore, they have to be content to be backward for the rest of their lives. In this regard, they are actually just useless fatalists.
    The attitude of promoters is the opposite. They certainly know that there are difficult conditions in everything, but what distinguishes them from regressives is: first, they do not look at difficult conditions one-sidedly and in isolation, but see favorable conditions at the same time, and are good at using favorable conditions to overcome unfavorable conditions. Second, they do not regard difficult conditions as absolute. They know that under certain conditions, unfavorable conditions can also be transformed into favorable conditions, and difficult conditions themselves contain factors that promote their transformation into favorable conditions. Third, they understand the importance of human factors and the subjective initiative of people. They know that under the correct leadership of the Party and the new socialist system, and under the conditions that the broad masses of people have been universally organized and unprecedentedly awakened, people have the ability to overcome any difficulties.
    The reason why Marxists have never been pessimistic about things, have always been optimists, and have never been intimidated by any difficulties is because they always use this revolutionary dialectical method to look at the difficult conditions in the development of things.
    Chairman Mao said that under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results. He also said that the result of the mutual struggle between contradictory opposites invariably transforms into each other under certain conditions. We have all seen now that this truth is similarly manifested in the issue of overcoming difficult conditions.
    This is an important Marxist method, and learning to use this method to observe problems and handle work is naturally of great significance to us.

    有利条件和不利条件
    众音
    这次生产建设大跃进中的许多生动的事实，促使人们对克服困难条件的问题有了新的认识。
    过去我们总是听见一些人在为自己工作的落后状况辩护时说，这是因为那里存在着一些不可克服的困难条件的缘故；而别的地方工作之所以先进，就是因为那里没有这些困难条件，并且存在着一些特别有利的条件的缘故。言下之意，自己工作的落后是理所当然的。
    但是自从全国大跃进的形势到来以后，我们已经很少听到这样的议论了。随着客观形势的变化，人们的思想状况也起了一个变化。过去人们强调的是客观困难，现在强调的则是克服困难条件的主观努力了。现在，人们已不再认为客观的困难条件是可以阻止人们前进的了，已不再认为还有什么困难是人们的努力所不可以克服的了。
    这样一来，也就使我们的工作发生了一个飞跃的变化。过去认为是不可能的事，现在可能了；过去认为只能慢慢办的事，现在可以很快地办到了。
    贫瘠的山区过去一向是被认为条件极端困难、根本无法达到高产的，但现在已经证明低产地完全可以变为高产地，历史上著名的低产地区陕北山区在1957年就出现了大面积的高产田，达到了亩产四百斤、一千斤、甚至两千斤以上的高产量。
    在多山地区实行水利化，原来也是被认为不可能的，但湖北襄阳专区在短短的一、二个月中即做到了这一点。
    为什么这些在过去看来是根本不可能的事，今天忽然成为可能了呢？原因就在于他们依靠有利条件，克服了不利条件。
    一切事物都是对立的统一。对于事物发展过程中的有利条件和不利条件，我们也必须这样去理解。不论什么事物，在它们的发展过程中，总是既包含了有利条件，也包含了不利条件的。只有有利条件、没有不利条件的事，是没有的；只有不利条件、没有有利条件的事，也是没有的。它们两者总是同时并存，并且是交错一起和互相影响的。事物就是在这种矛盾的条件下向前发展的。
    我们革命者的责任，也就是努力克服不利条件，发展有利条件，以帮助和促进新生事物的迅速发展。
    所以对于我们革命者说来，问题不在于是否有困难条件存在，而在于人们如何对待这些困难条件。恰恰是在这个问题上，促进派和促退派持有完全不同的态度。
    促退派看待一切事情，总是首先强调客观条件不好，他们的眼睛只是向着不利条件，不看或看不见有利条件，他们更不懂得可以利用有利条件去改变不利条件。他们在困难面前总是愁眉苦脸，唉声叹气，一筹莫展，把困难夸大到不可克服的程度。所以他们只好甘心落后一辈子。在这点上，他们实际上只是一些无用的宿命论者。
    促进派的态度则正好相反。他们当然也知道任何事情都存在着困难条件，但是他们和促退派不同的是：第一，他们不是片面地孤立地去看待困难条件，而是同时看到有利条件，并且善于利用有利条件去克服不利条件。第二，他们不把困难条件看成是绝对的，他们知道在一定条件下，不利条件也可以转化成有利条件，困难条件本身就包含着促使它向有利条件转化的因素。第三，他们懂得重视人的因素，重视人的能动性。他们知道在有了党的正确领导和新的社会主义制度的条件下，在广大人民群众已经普遍组织起来和空前觉悟的条件下，人们有能力去战胜任何困难。
    马克思主义者之所以从来不对事情表示悲观，从来都是乐观主义者，从来不曾被任何困难所吓倒，就是因为他们总是用这种革命的辩证的方法去看待事物发展中的困难条件的缘故。
    毛主席说，在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。又说，矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。我们大家现在已经看见，在克服困难条件的问题上，同样地表现出了这一真理。
    这是一个重要的马克思主义的方法，学会用这一方法去观察问题和处理工作，对于我们自然有很重大的意义。
