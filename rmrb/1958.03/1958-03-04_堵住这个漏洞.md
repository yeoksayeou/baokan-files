    Plug This Leak
    A large amount of oil remains in the empty oil tankers returning to Manzhouli Station from various domestic oil refineries. Over the past year, the Manzhouli Vehicle Depot has extracted over 1,247 tons of oil from these empty tankers, with a total value of 177,074 yuan based on a market price of 142 yuan per ton. This alarming waste has become even more serious recently. On January 31st, among fifteen empty oil tankers, six contained twenty to thirty tons of residual oil, nine contained ten to twenty tons, and six contained less than ten tons. Over 300 tons of residual oil were collected in a single day.
    Manzhouli Station lacks oil loading equipment, forcing them to store various residual oils mixed together. This results in impure oil quality, making sales difficult and leading to significant stockpiles, causing substantial losses to the country.
    Currently, a movement against waste and conservatism is underway nationwide. It is recommended that relevant authorities conduct inspections and take measures to plug this leak.

    堵住这个漏洞
    从国内各炼油厂返回满洲里车站的空油槽车，剩下大量的油。一年多来，满洲里车辆段从空油槽车内取出来的油共有一千二百四十七吨多，以每吨市价一百四十二元计算，总值十七万七千零七十四元。这种惊人的浪费现象，近来更为严重。在1月31日这一天，在十五列空油槽车中，剩油二十至三十吨的有六列，十吨至二十吨的有九列，十吨以下的有六列。一天中得到剩油三百多吨。
    满洲里车站没有装油设备，不得不把各种剩油混杂一起存放，因此油的质量不纯，推销困难，大量积压，给国家造成很大的损失。
    目前全国正在开展反浪费反保守运动，建议有关机关进行检查，并采取措施堵塞这个漏洞。
