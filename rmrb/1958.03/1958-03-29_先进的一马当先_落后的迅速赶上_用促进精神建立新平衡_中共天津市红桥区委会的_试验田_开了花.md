    (Reported by Tianjin Daily) In the midst of the Great Leap Forward, a contradiction emerged in Hongqiao District, Tianjin, where the rapid development of machinery manufacturing led to a shortage of castings. After discovering this problem, the district's party committee leaders deeply mobilized veteran workers in iron foundries to adopt new operating methods, which doubled the efficiency of casting production. A new balance was established between machine processing and casting production.

    With the development of agricultural production, the production tasks of an agricultural machinery manufacturing plant in the district greatly increased. However, due to the failure to supply castings in a timely manner, there was a phenomenon of work stoppage and waiting for materials. Liu Zhong, the Secretary of the Hongqiao District Committee of the CPC, who was in charge of the "experimental field" in this factory, learned about this problem. After further investigation and research, he found that the failure of castings to meet the needs of machine processing was a common phenomenon in Hongqiao District. The district's eight iron foundries had accepted orders for more than 26,000 tons of castings, but in reality could only produce more than 16,000 tons, which had a great impact on machinery manufacturing.

    Faced with this imbalanced production situation, some factory directors of iron foundries advocated that machine processing should accommodate casting production in order to achieve balance. Many factory directors of iron foundries advocated expanding the factory buildings to increase casting production. After studying and analyzing these situations, the Hongqiao District Committee of the CPC criticized the regressive idea of requiring machine processing to accommodate casting production. The Hongqiao District Committee believed that the production of the machinery industry involved the leap forward of the entire industry, transportation industry, and especially agriculture. Therefore, it was necessary to increase casting production to meet the needs of machine processing and achieve balance on the basis of the leap forward. At the same time, the Hongqiao District Committee believed that expanding factory buildings could not take effect immediately and could not solve the current urgent problem of insufficient casting supply, criticizing the idea of "seeing things but not people."

    The Hongqiao District Committee mobilized and relied on the masses of employees to solve this problem, and convened a symposium of veteran technical workers from eight iron foundries on March 20. At the meeting, the veteran workers suggested breaking the old rules of the casting industry and changing the current "all-inclusive" operating method (that is, the operation of the five processes of sand mixing, modeling, pouring, box removal, and sand cleaning is contracted by one worker, regardless of technical or non-technical work), and adopting a new operating method of "stage responsibility, cross operation" (that is, separating the five processes, assigning them to dedicated personnel, implementing large-scale assembly lines, and concentrating the strength of technical workers on technical work).

    The day after the meeting, under the leadership of the veteran workers, the employees of each iron foundry immediately conducted experiments according to the new operating method. The Fourth Iron Foundry, with the worst equipment in the district, increased its casting output by 100% on that day. The Hongqiao District Committee then convened an on-site meeting at the Fourth Iron Foundry to promote the factory's successful experience. At the on-site meeting, a wave of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced was immediately set off. The eight iron foundries comprehensively implemented the new operating method of "stage responsibility, cross operation." Within a few days, the efficiency of casting production generally doubled, establishing a new balance with machine processing.

    先进的一马当先  落后的迅速赶上
    用促进精神建立新平衡
    中共天津市红桥区委会的“试验田”开了花
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：在大跃进声中，天津市红桥区出现了机械制造飞速发展而铸件供不应求的矛盾。这个区的党委负责人发现这个问题后，深入发动铸铁厂的老工人采取新的操作方法，使铸件生产效率提高一倍左右。机器加工和铸件生产之间建立起新的平衡。
    随着农业生产的发展，这个区的一个农业机械制造厂的生产任务大大增加，但是因为铸件不能及时供应，造成了停工待料的现象。这个工厂每月需要铸件二百三十吨，而互相协作的机械铸造厂只能供应三十吨。在这个工厂搞“试验田”的中共红桥区委书记刘忠，了解到这个问题后，经过进一步调查研究，发现铸件不能适应机器加工的需要，在红桥区是一个普遍的现象。全区八个铸铁厂接受的铸件订货已达二万六千多吨，实际上只能生产一万六千多吨，对机械制造发生了极大的影响。
    面对这种生产不平衡的局面，有的铸铁厂的厂长主张让机器加工迁就铸件生产，来求得平衡；不少的铸铁厂的厂长主张扩建厂房来提高铸件生产。中共红桥区委研究和分析了这些情况以后，批判了要求机器加工迁就铸件生产的促退思想。红桥区委认为，机械工业的生产，牵涉到整个工业、交通运输业、特别是农业的跃进，因此必须提高铸件生产，适应机器加工的需要，在跃进的基础上求得平衡。红桥区委同时认为扩建厂房不能马上见效，不能解决目前有如燃眉之急的铸件供应不足的问题，批判了这种“见物不见人”的思想。
    红桥区委发动和依靠职工群众来解决这个问题，在3月20日召开了八个铸铁厂的老技术工人座谈会。会上，老工人建议打破铸铁业的陈规，改变现行的“一包到底”的操作方法（即配砂、造型、浇铸、打箱、清砂五个工序的操作，不论技术性和非技术性的活，都由一个工人包下来），而采用“阶段负责、交叉作业”的新操作方法（即把五个工序分开，由专人负责，实行大流水，技术工人的力量集中使用在技术活上）。
    会后第二天，在老工人带动下，各铸铁厂的职工马上按新的操作法进行试验。全区设备最差的第四铸铁厂，当天的铸件产量就提高了100％。红桥区委紧接着在第四铸铁厂召开了现场会议，推广这个厂的成功经验。在现场会议上顿时掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮。八个铸铁厂全面推行了“阶段负责、交叉作业”的新操作方法，几天内，铸件生产效率普遍提高了一倍左右，同机器加工建立了新的平衡。
