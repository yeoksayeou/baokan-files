Extravagant Kindergartens Cannot Cultivate Healthy "Flowers"; Waste in State机关托儿所 Kindergartens and Nurseries Must Be Opposed

    This newspaper reports that many kindergartens and nurseries affiliated with central state organs exhibit wasteful practices in personnel allocation, expenditure, capital construction, and equipment. Currently, some kindergartens are improving their work in conjunction with the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign.

    Many kindergartens are bureaucratized, with large and overlapping organizations and excessive personnel. Some kindergartens, serving only two or three hundred children, have four to five directors. The State Council Kindergarten has accountants, administrators, purchasing agents, cooks, boiler workers, laundry workers, cleaners, and communication personnel among its administrative staff. If these personnel could be mutually adjusted, with one person doing two jobs, a considerable amount of manpower could be saved. The administrative staff in many kindergartens exceeds the prescribed standards.

    There is also serious waste in expenditure. According to statistics, the average monthly cost borne by the public for each child in kindergartens and nurseries of central state organs reaches 19.45 yuan. The highest public subsidy for full-time care is over 38 yuan, and the lowest is 18 yuan. The highest subsidy for day care is 37 yuan, and the lowest is 12 yuan.

    Under the guidance of seeking beauty and emphasizing ostentation, many kindergartens have constructed overly luxurious buildings with high costs, large areas, and low utilization rates. The equipment in kindergartens is also too particular. One kindergarten with only a little over a hundred children has set up unnecessary large toys such as electric airplanes and tracked iron horses. Some kindergartens have two or three pianos, dedicated film projectors, and slide projectors. The children's beds in some kindergartens are all wire beds, and the stairs and corridors are covered with carpets.

    Because the living standards of the children in these kindergartens are too high and the material conditions are too good, some pure children have developed "little master" habits. The general children's living abilities are much worse than those of the children of the masses. Some five- or six-year-olds cannot fold their quilts, rely on others for everything, and develop bad habits of despising labor. Some kindergarten children dislike the children of ordinary people for being too dirty and do not play with them. Some kindergarten children, after being admitted to primary school, dislike the school for not having wire beds and are unwilling to study there. These unhealthy ideological consciousnesses of children are inseparable from the influence of daily life, education, and family life in kindergartens.

### 铺张浪费的幼儿园栽培不出身心健康的“花朵”  国家机关托儿所的浪费现象需要反掉

    铺张浪费的幼儿园栽培不出身心健康的“花朵”
    国家机关托儿所的浪费现象需要反掉
    本报讯　中央国家机关所属的不少幼儿园、托儿所，在人员编制、经费开支、基本建设、设备等方面，都有浪费现象。目前，有些幼儿园正结合反浪费反保守运动，改进工作。
    许多幼儿园机关化，机构庞大、层次重叠，人员过多。有的幼儿园收托二、三百个儿童，就设置了四个到五个园主任。国务院幼儿园在行政人员中就设有会计员、管理员、采购员、炊事员、锅炉工人、洗衣员、清洁员、通讯员等。这些人员，如能互相调剂，一人可兼做两种工作，就可节省不少人力。很多幼儿园的行政人员都超过了规定的标准。
    在经费开支方面也有严重的浪费现象。据统计，中央国家机关的幼儿园、托儿所的每个儿童，每月平均由公家负担费用达十九元四角五分，全托儿童最高由公家补助到三十八元以上，最低也有十八元；日托儿童补助最高有到三十七元的，最低也有十二元。
    很多幼儿园在追求美观、讲究排场的思想指导下，房屋的建造过于华丽，造价高、占地面积大、利用率不高。幼儿园的设备也太讲究，有一个只有一百多儿童的幼儿园，也设置了不必要的大型玩具，如电动飞机、有轨铁马等。有的幼儿园里设有两三架钢琴，专用电影放映机、幻灯机等。有的幼儿园的儿童卧床一律采用钢丝床，楼梯和走廊里都铺有地毯。
    这些幼儿园由于儿童们的生活水平太高，物质条件太好，把有些纯洁的孩子们养成“小少爷”习气，一般儿童的生活能力比群众子女差得多，有的五六岁的孩子不会叠被子，事事依赖人，养成轻视劳动的不良习惯。有的幼儿园的孩子嫌老百姓孩子太脏，不在一起玩。有的幼儿园的孩子考取了小学后，嫌学校里没有钢丝床，不愿在那里学习。儿童的这些不健康的思想意识，是与幼儿园的日常生活、教育及家庭生活的影响分不开的。
