    In Memory of Mr. Cheng Yanqiu
    Chen Shutong
    The death of Peking Opera artist Mr. Cheng Yanqiu is a great loss to our country's literary and art circles.
    Mr. Cheng Yanqiu's life is worthy of respect, not only because he was known as one of the "Four Great Dan" of Peking Opera and was a creative and outstanding artist. More valuable is his unyielding national integrity in the face of enemy coercion. During the Anti-Japanese War, in then-occupied Peiping, he refused to serve the enemy and the traitors, and made a living by farming in the suburbs of Beijing.
    Mr. Cheng's life made great contributions to the innovation of Peking Opera art, thus forming his own school. His singing style is unique. I remember the famous senior Peking Opera actor Mr. Chen Delin once said: "After listening to Cheng Yanqiu's 'Scolding the Palace' and 'June Snow,' I dare not sing these two operas anymore." The musicians who have collaborated with Mr. Cheng also feel that it is not easy to accompany him, because he never sticks to convention. He is constantly studying singing and often changes it. Mr. Cheng's outstanding achievements in Peking Opera art are inseparable from his ability to humbly learn from various local operas, absorb their strengths, make full use of them, and his spirit of daring to reform. After the national liberation, he had more opportunities to collect materials and conduct research in various places. Usually, in casual conversations, he even said that he benefited a lot from watching movies. These all illustrate what a modest person he was. Mr. Cheng was a versatile person. He also loved to write poetry and paint, and he was good at it whenever he put his pen to paper.
    As an actor, Mr. Cheng Yanqiu did not have any of the bad habits of the old society's performing arts circles. His personal life was very frugal and simple. He was filial to his mother, loved his brothers, and cared about the cultivation and education of his nephews and nieces. He was also a person full of a sense of justice, and he always tried his best to help his relatives and friends in need. His death is not only a loss to the country, but also a loss to each of his relatives and friends.
    In order to mourn Mr. Cheng Yanqiu, I respectfully offer the following elegy:
        Integrating and mastering, establishing a school of your own, still continue to delve into it, hoping to benefit socialism;
        Resolutely fighting, finally able to join the Party, it is a glorious end, perhaps worthy of an artistic talent.

    哀悼程砚秋先生
    陈叔通
    京剧艺术家程砚秋先生病逝了，这是我国文艺界一个很大的损失。
    程砚秋先生的一生，值得人们尊敬的，不仅因为他曾被誉为京剧四大名旦之一，是一位富有创造性的卓越的艺术家。更可贵的，是他在敌人的威逼下，不屈不挠的民族气节。抗日战争时期，在当时沦陷了的北平，他拒绝为敌人和汉奸服务，在京郊种地为生。
    程先生的一生，对于京剧艺术创造的革新，作出了很大的贡献，因而自成一派。他的唱腔别具风格，记得著名的前辈京剧演员陈德霖先生曾说过：“听了程砚秋的‘骂殿’和‘六月雪’以后，这两出戏我再也不敢唱了。”跟程先生合作过的琴师，也都感到替他伴奏不容易；因为他从不墨守陈规，他随时都在研究唱腔，经常有变化。程先生在京剧艺术上的卓越成就，是与他能够虚心向各种地方戏曲学习，吸取它们的长处，充分加以运用，勇于改革的精神分不开的。全国解放以后，他有了更多的机会到各地去收集资料，进行研究。平时，在闲谈中，他甚至表示，从看电影中也得益不少。这些都说明他是怎样一个虚怀若谷的人。程先生是一个多才多艺的人，他还喜爱吟诗作画，只要出笔便好。
    作为演员的程砚秋先生，没有一点旧社会梨园行的坏习气。他个人的生活很刻苦、朴实，他孝顺母亲，爱护兄弟，关心对子侄们的培养和教育。他还是一个富于正义感的人，对于亲友的困难，总是尽力设法帮助。他的死，不仅是国家的损失，同时也是他的每个亲友的损失。
    为了悼念程砚秋先生，敬挽如下：
        融会贯通，卓然成家，仍继续钻研，以冀有利社会主义；
        坚决奋斗，终能入党，是光荣结束，庶几无愧艺术人才。
