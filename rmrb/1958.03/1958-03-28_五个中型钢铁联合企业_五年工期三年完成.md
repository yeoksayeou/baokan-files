Xinhua News Agency, March 27th—The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's original plan to construct five medium-sized iron and steel complexes during the Second Five-Year Plan period will be completed and put into production by 1960, ahead of schedule. This is the leap forward plan of "completing a five-year construction period in three years" proposed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry during the Double-Anti Movement.

    These five medium-sized iron and steel complexes include the newly built Hunan Iron and Steel Plant and the expanded Taiyuan, Shijingshan, Ma'anshan, and Chongqing Iron and Steel Plants. They will all become combined enterprises with ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling processing departments.

    The planning department of the Capital Construction Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has consulted with the design, construction departments, and the five enterprises to arrange the new plant construction progress. Designers have decided to break the past routine of issuing drawings to cooperate with the new construction progress. Responsible cadres of the Construction Department have recently set off to the site to convene promotion meetings to exchange experiences in accelerating the construction progress.

    五个中型钢铁联合企业
    五年工期三年完成
    据新华社27日讯　冶金工业部原定在第二个五年计划期间建成的五个中型钢铁联合企业，都将提前到1960年全部建成并投入生产。这是冶金部在双反运动中提出的“五年工期三年完成”的跃进计划。
    这五个中型钢铁联合企业，包括新建的湖南钢铁厂和扩建的太原、石景山、马鞍山、重庆钢铁厂。它们都将成为有炼铁、炼钢和轧钢加工等部门的联合企业。
    冶金工业部基本建设司的计划部门已经同设计、施工部门及五个企业协商安排了这个新的建厂进度。设计人员决定打破过去出图的常规，配合新的施工进度。建筑司的负责干部最近已经出发到现场去召开促进会，交流加快施工进度的经验。
