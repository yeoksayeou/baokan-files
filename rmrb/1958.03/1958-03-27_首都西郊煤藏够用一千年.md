    Coal Deposits in Western Suburbs of the Capital Sufficient for a Thousand Years

    (Our Newspaper) This paper reports: The Beijing Western Coalfield Geological Exploration Team has surveyed and determined that the coal reserves in areas such as Tantuo Temple, Zhoukoudian, Da'anshan, and Badachu in the western mountainous region of the capital amount to more than 2 billion tons. Based on Beijing's current annual consumption of over 2 million tons, this amount is sufficient for a thousand years. Among these coal reserves, many are high-quality anthracite coal with high calorific value and low ash content, suitable for civilian use and also usable as industrial coal.

    首都西郊煤藏够用一千年
    本报讯　京西煤田地质勘探队，在首都西部山区潭拓寺、周口店、大鞍山、八大处等地勘探查明，煤藏量有二十多亿吨。按北京市目前每年全市用二百多万吨计算，可以够一千年用。这些储煤中，有很多是优质无烟煤，发热量高，灰分少，能供民用，还可以作为工业用煤。
