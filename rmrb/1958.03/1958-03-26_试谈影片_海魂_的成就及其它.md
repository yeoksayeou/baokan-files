Title: A Discussion of the Film "Sea Soul"'s Achievements and Other Matters

After seeing "Sea Soul," several characters left a deep impression, and many touching scenes lingered in my mind. The film has gained and achieved something in character creation.

Here, I would like to propose two characters for study: the ideological development and character formation of Dou Erpeng, and the portrayal of the Captain. These two characters are relatively typical. They are not both representatives of the two sides of the conflict. Dou Erpeng only realized the class nature of the reactionaries and became aware after Chen Chunguan's repeated efforts and his own personal experience. This character has a very lovable and endearing, forthright and bold personality, with the traditional character of the Chinese working people, especially the fishermen along the coast. His attitude of hating evil like poison is consistent throughout his actions. This attitude is seemingly consistent on the surface, but in essence, it is changing and developing.

Every scene in which this character appears in the film is dramatic. The so-called dramatic scenes are where the character appears at the center of the conflict. There is a scene where, on the deck, amidst the chaos, officers are escorting smuggled goods, and whips are habitually lashed onto the soldiers. At this moment, we see the indignant Dou Erpeng, his bear-paw-like hands clenched into fists, his bright eyes wide open. His silent protest is shocking. Similarly, in the crew quarters, the scene where Dou Erpeng stands up for Yu Wenxiao and subdues Yang Laowu is also extremely moving. The film deliberately uses a contrasting approach to highlight Yang Laowu's tyranny, even giving a close-up of Yang's unique skill of throwing knives. When the childlike Yu Wenxiao dares to be angry but doesn't dare to speak out, and those who are used to Yang Laowu's skill are also helpless, Dou Erpeng, like a mountain, rushes forward, pulls out three throwing knives, and breaks them into six pieces in an instant. These few shots vividly depict and enact the life of sailors under the rule of the reactionary Kuomintang and the different mental outlooks of the sailors, highlighting the character of Dou Erpeng, expressing the friendship between Dou Erpeng and Yu Wenxiao, and foreshadowing Dou Erpeng's subsequent actions – gaining Yu Wenxiao's support to cut the ropes of the civilian boats. The incident of cutting the ropes of the civilian boats is related to the transformation of Dou Erpeng's thinking. Because of this incident, the contradiction of the entire play quickly pushes towards the climax of the uprising. The film uses a considerable number of scenes to reflect that this incident is inevitable and appropriate, thus leaving an extremely deep impression in the audience's mind.

The warship was ordered from Taiwan to blockade the mouth of the Yangtze River, passing through the sea off Zhejiang, encountering civilian boats. Under the captain's command, the civilian boats were looted clean, and the young and middle-aged men on the civilian boats were captured to be used as "anti-communist" cannon fodder, and then the old, weak, women, and children, along with the civilian boats, were sunk by artillery fire. This bloody massacre is one of the innumerable crimes of the reactionary Kuomintang officers and soldiers. Some officers and soldiers deceived by the Chiang gang were greatly stimulated by this bloody fact and also received a profound lesson. At this time, it can be said that it was the right time for Chen Chunguan to mobilize Bai Wu; Lei Wanhe was later able to follow them, and his motive should also lie here. As for Dou Erpeng, although this incident had a direct impact on his later participation in the uprising, as a bold and unruly person who hates evil like poison, he has his own different views and reactions. He protested against this unjust incident with action, picking up an axe and going to work. What he did was a happy thing, a popular thing, a good thing. Therefore, he received the support of the watchman Yu, and also the tacit approval of the duty officer Bai Wu and the duty sergeant Lei Wanhe.

After Dou Erpeng cut the ropes of the civilian boats, he suffered severe punishment and retaliation from the reactionary rulers: Dou Erpeng was whipped all over his body, and Yu was beaten half to death. This directly stimulated and promoted Dou's understanding of the essence of life. Dou Erpeng changed, no longer a cynical person who smiled, cursed, and scolded. He began to think and gradually realized that to take revenge, it is not enough to do it alone, you must organize and unite everyone to do it together. This is the specific content and process of the growth of Dou Erpeng's character. Countless details are organized into such a vivid character image, making people feel that this character is real and credible.

Writing negative characters is extremely easy to fall into generalization, but the artistic creators of "Sea Soul" can start from a higher perspective on this issue, and start from the depths of the character's soul to dig out the essential side, thus creating this Captain.

The Captain appears in many scenes, but not much ink is used, yet the image is very clear.

He is an officer trained by the British "Royal Army," loyal to Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people regime, cherishing the superiority of his class background, and good at giving alms and showing pity to win people's hearts. Among the soldiers, he saw that Chen Chunguan was a figure that could not be ignored; among the officers, he chose Bai Wu as an object that he could personally control and cultivate. He leaves a way out for every move he makes, and his courage and ruthlessness are even more evident in the turmoil. Ordering the looting of civilian boats and shelling defeated soldiers is one side of him, while presiding over the distribution of rewards, lightly punishing Bai Wu, and wiping the sweat from Yu's head with a handkerchief, portrays another side of his insidious nature. The combination of kindness and power is his strategy for leading troops. When carrying out "military discipline" on Erpeng and others, he pretends to be compelled, comparing himself to Zhuge Liang shedding tears to execute Ma Su. The purpose of posing is to win people's hearts. He does not approve of Kong Xiaotian's ignorance and blatant cruelty. His lecture to Kong not only shows the so-called "tradition" of governing the army of this class and faction he represents, but also reveals the tragedy of the declining class – the delusion of maintaining military morale to save the power that is tending towards total collapse is impossible. When he is alone, he also has his own troubles. As a "superior Chinese," it is also difficult for him to endure the humiliation inflicted by the American warships. Nevertheless, his future and illusions are all pinned on imperialist "aggression." This kind of person may not know that he is making a dying struggle, but he has to deceive himself to avoid facing reality.

The character of the Captain reflects the ugly essence of bourgeois intellectuals. Its typical significance is not limited to the type of reactionary officers, which is where this character succeeds.

In the film's character portrayal, more than just these two are successful. Of course, these two characters should be said to be more prominent. The series of entanglements generated by these two characters constitute the main plot of the film, which is related to the rise and fall of the two sides of the contradiction. Therefore, the establishment of these two character images also lays the foundation for the artistic achievement of this film.

Although the film has the above achievements, it is a pity that it still feels insufficient after watching it. The image of the main character, Chen Chunguan, is not vivid and prominent enough. Chen Chunguan's thinking seems to be written with a straightforward approach, that is to say, he has his own position and his own views. His reason for rushing back to the warship to withdraw from Shanghai is planned. Then what is the plan? No explanation. He arranged the uprising, but his ideological basis is not specific. He seems to be different from ordinary sailors, but where is he different? His mobilization of Jiang Wang and Dou Erpeng seems to be caused by the rampage of American soldiers and the unfortunate encounter of Wen Mengyuan in Taiwan. Naturally, external stimuli may be one of the motivations for promoting the uprising, but it should not be the only one. A series of events occurred on the warship, and each event can be used as a fuse for the uprising, but only the ambushing of bombs is seen, but the detonator Chen Chunguan's movement is not seen. Chen Chunguan should not stay out of many contradictory struggles, especially the main contradictions.

The film does not spend enough effort on this main character, so only a few thrilling shots are left at the climax of the uprising. This is what we feel deeply insufficient.

The Taiwanese girl Wen Mengyuan, who is related to the character of Chen Chunguan, only has a faint sketch. The pain and hope of the Taiwanese compatriots should be imaginable to those who have lived in the semi-colonial old China, but unfortunately the film failed to express it well, making some of the scenes in Taiwan seem like living reports, and the relationship between Wen and Chen is also close to fiction. This plot is alienated from the main contradiction – the uprising. On one side is the real knife and gun, inspiring life-and-death struggle, and on the other side is an interlude of joys and sorrows like a dream. This point is probably also a shortcoming!

Taiwan is still under the control of the US-Chiang, and the Taiwanese people and the civil servants and officers who are forced to work for the Chiang regime all yearn for the mainland and look forward to returning to the embrace of the motherland. This film reflects the mood of the military and civilians in Taiwan and predicts the path that the military and civilians in Taiwan may and must take. This should be said to be the greatest contribution of this film.

    试谈影片“海魂”的成就及其它
    凤子
    看了“海魂”，有几个人物印象极深，有好些动人的场景久久不能忘去。影片在人物创造上是有收获的，有成就的。
    这里想提出两个人物来研究——窦二鹏的思想发展及其性格的形成，和上校舰长这个人物的刻划。这两个人物比较具有典型意义。他们并非都是矛盾两方的代表人物。窦二鹏是在陈春官多次争取之下，又因为有了亲身体验，才认识了反动派的阶级本质，从而有了觉悟的。这个人物具有非常可爱可亲的豪迈爽朗的性格，有着中国劳动人民，特别是沿海渔民具有的传统性格。他的嫉恶如仇的对待事物的态度贯串在整个行动中。这种态度表面上是一贯的，而实质上却在变化着，发展着。
    这个人物出现在影片的画面上，都是有戏的一些场景。所谓有戏，也就是人物出现在矛盾集中的焦点。有一个镜头，在舱面上，在混乱中，军官们押运着私货，鞭绳习惯地挥掷在士兵们的身上，这时候，我们看到义愤填膺的窦二鹏，他那熊掌一样的手捏紧了拳头，他那炯炯有神的两眼圆睁着。他的无言的抗议，使人震动。同样，在兵舱里，窦二鹏为虞文孝打抱不平，制服杨老五的场景也是极其动人的。影片有意以反笔烘托杨老五的跋扈，甚至特写了杨的扔飞刀的绝技。当孩子般的小虞敢怒而不敢言，看惯了杨老五这一手的人也都莫可如何的时候，窦二鹏像座山一样闯上前来，拔出三把飞刀，一下就折为六段。这几个镜头生动地写出了也演出了国民党反动派统治下的水兵的生活，和水兵们不同的精神面貌，突出了窦二鹏这个人物，表现了窦二鹏和虞文孝的友谊，更为窦二鹏下面的行动——得到虞文孝的支持砍断民船的绳索设下伏笔。砍断民船的绳索这一事件，关系着窦二鹏这个人物思想的转变。由于这一事件，将全剧的矛盾很快地推向起义的高潮。影片以相当多的画面反映了这一事件是必然的，是应当的，因而在观众脑子里留下极为深刻的印象。
    军舰从台湾奉命封锁长江口，路经浙江海面，遇到民船。在舰长指挥之下，民船被搜刮净尽，民船上的青壮年也被俘虏来作为“反共”的炮灰，然后老弱妇孺连同民船被炮火击沉。这一血腥屠杀是反动的国民党官兵们罄竹难书的罪行之一。受蒋帮欺骗的一部分官兵，在这血腥的事实面前受到了极大的刺激，也接受了深刻的教训。这时候陈春官来动员白鹜，可以说正是时候；雷万和后来能跟他们走，其动机应也在此。至于窦二鹏，尽管这一事件对他后来参加起义有直接的影响，可是，作为豪迈不羁而且又嫉恶如仇的这个人，他更有他不同的看法和反应。他以行动来抗议这种不义事件，抄起把斧子就干上了。他干的是件痛快事，是得人心的事，是件好事。因此他得到值更兵小虞的支持，也得到值更官白鹜和值更士雷万和的默许。
    窦二鹏砍断了民船的绳索后，遭到反动统治者严重的处罚和报复：窦二鹏被鞭责的遍体鳞伤，小虞被吊打到半死。这就更直接地刺激了也促进了窦对生活本质的认识。窦二鹏变了，不再是一个嬉笑怒骂玩世不恭的人了，他开始思索起来，并且逐渐认识到，要报仇，单干硬干是不行的，要组织起来，要团结大家一起干。这就是窦二鹏这个人物成长的具体内容和过程。无数的细节组织成这样一个活生生的人物形象，使人感到这个人物是真实可信的。
    写反面人物，是极容易流入一般化的，可是“海魂”的艺术创造者们在这个问题上，能从较高的角度着笔，能从人物的灵魂深处着手，来挖掘本质的一面，因而创造出了这个上校舰长。
    上校舰长出场不少，着墨并不多，然而形象却非常鲜明。
    他是一个受过英国“皇军”训练的军官，忠实于蒋介石反人民的政权，矜持阶级出身的优越，并且善于施舍怜悯以争取人心，在兵士中他看出了陈春官是不可忽视的一个人物；在军官们中间他选中白鹜作为个人可以驾驭的对象来培养。他着着棋都留个退路，而在动乱中更显出他的魄力和阴狠。下令抢劫民船、炮击溃兵是他的一面，而主持发放赏金，从轻处罚白鹜，拿手绢拭擦小虞头上的汗水，却又刻划出了他的阴险的另一面。恩威并施是他的带兵的策略。对二鹏等人执行“军纪”，他假装作是迫不得已，自况为诸葛亮挥泪斩马谡。所以作态，目的在争得人心。对于孔啸天的无知和露骨的残暴他是不赞成的。他对孔的训话，既写出了他所代表的这一阶层、这一派系所谓的治军的“传统”，也揭示出没落阶级的悲哀——妄想以维系军心来挽回趋于全部崩溃的权势已经是不可能的了。当他独自一人时，他也有他的苦闷。作为“高等华人”，他也很难忍受美国军舰施给的侮辱。尽管如此，他的前途和幻想却全部寄托在帝国主义的“侵略”上。这种人未始不知是在作垂死的挣扎，但是却又不得不欺骗自己不去面对现实。
    上校舰长这个人物，反映出资产阶级知识分子的丑恶本质，其典型意义不局限在反动军官这一类型而已，这更是这个人物成功之处。
    影片在人物刻划上，成功的不止这两个，当然，这两个人物应该说是更其突出一些。这两个人物所产生的一系列纠葛结构成影片的主要情节，关系着矛盾两方面力量的消长，因此这两个人物形象的树立也就奠定了这部影片艺术成就的基础。
    影片虽有如上的成就，遗憾的是观后仍感到不足。主要角色陈春官的形象是不够生动突出的。陈春官的思想似乎是用开门见山的手法来写的，也就是说他有他的立场、他的看法。他所以赶回军舰撤离上海是有打算的。那么打算如何呢？没有交代。他布置起义，他的思想根据却不具体。他似乎不同于一般的水兵，不同在哪里呢？他动员蒋旺，动员窦二鹏，似乎是因为在台湾见到美兵横行和温梦媛的不幸遭遇所引起的，自然外界刺激可能是推动起义的动因之一，但不应该是唯一的。军舰上发生了一系列的事件，每一事件都可以作为起义的导火线，可是只见埋伏炸弹却不见点火人陈春官的动静。陈春官不应置身在许多矛盾斗争之外，尤其是主要的矛盾冲突之外。
    影片在这个主要人物身上花的力量不够，因而到了起义高潮就只剩下几个惊险的镜头了。这是我们深感不足的。
    同陈春官这个人物有关的台湾姑娘温梦媛只有一幅淡淡的素描。台湾同胞的痛苦和希望，曾经生活在半殖民地旧中国的人应该想像得到的，可惜影片未能很好地表现出来，使得在台湾的几场戏有的近似活报，温和陈春官的关系也迹近虚构，这段情节同主要矛盾——起义是游离的。一面是真刀真枪激励人心的生死斗争，一面却是梦境一般的一段悲欢离合的插曲。这一点恐怕也是美中不足的地方吧！
    台湾还在美蒋控制之下，台湾人民和被迫为蒋政权工作的公务人员和官兵们都向往着大陆，盼望回到祖国的怀抱。这部影片反映了台湾的军民的心情，预示了台湾军民可能和必须走的道路，这应该说是这部影片最大的贡献了。
