    Convenient for the Masses, Beneficial to Production
    Ministry of Railways Reforms Unreasonable Rules and Regulations

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Railways, in the rectification campaign, has revised some unreasonable and impractical rules and regulations, clearing obstacles for further enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses and developing production. The Vehicle Bureau, Engineering Bureau, Freight Bureau, and Passenger Bureau of the Ministry of Railways alone have already revised and abolished over a hundred outdated rules and regulations.

    Some unreasonable rules and regulations were caused by conservative thinking. They restricted the development of production. For example, the Vehicle Bureau excessively emphasized safety and feared a high vehicle damage rate, setting many freight car marked load capacities (i.e., the mark on the freight car indicating how many tons it can load) too low. For example, the X66 type freight car was originally designed with a load capacity of 45 tons, but the marked load capacity was stipulated as 40 tons, and no increased loading was allowed. Regarding this regulation, in recent years, especially during the rectification campaign, various other bureaus of the Ministry of Railways and many on-site units requested the Vehicle Bureau to revise the marked load capacity of freight cars based on actual conditions. Now, based on the opinions put forward by various parties, the Vehicle Bureau immediately began technical research and experiments, and held a major debate on this issue within the bureau. The results of the research and debate proved that there are currently 39 types of freight cars nationwide that can be increased in load capacity, totaling 48,414 vehicles, which can be increased by one to five tons each. In total, these vehicles can increase the load capacity by 70,527 tons at one time. Based on the national average marked load capacity of freight cars in 1957 being 38.6 tons, after the load increase, the average marked load capacity of each freight car can be increased to 39.4 tons, equivalent to adding 1,790 freight cars. Recently, the Ministry of Railways has drafted a ministerial order to revise the previous marked load capacity of freight cars.

    Many rules and regulations that were set too detailed and inflexible have also been revised during the rectification. For example, the line overhaul work scope stipulated by the Engineering Bureau stated that 1,600 or 1,840 sleepers should be laid per kilometer in straight sections. However, there were no specific figures for laying sleepers based on the specific conditions of the line. Although some straight sections did not require laying 1,840 sleepers, laying 1,600 sleepers was insufficient, and there were no other levels between 1,600 and 1,840. Therefore, 1,840 sleepers had to be laid uniformly, causing a great waste. The Engineering Bureau has now revised this regulation based on the opinions of the masses, adding the number 1,760 between 1,600 and 1,840. The Vehicle Bureau has also revised the previous regulation of annual repairs for passenger cars once a year to annual repairs based on the actual condition of the vehicles.

    Many rules and regulations that increased trouble for the executors below and were detrimental to production have also been revised in a pragmatic manner. For example, the "Regulations for the Transportation of Passengers, Luggage, and Parcels" formulated by the Passenger Bureau stipulated that the weight of each parcel should not exceed 80 kilograms, and if it was overweight, it needed to be approved by the Railway Administration Bureau. This only increased trouble for the lower levels and promoted bureaucracy in the Administration Bureau. This regulation has now been revised.

    Some unreasonable and unfavorable to collaboration rules and regulations have also been revised. For example, the original penalty system stipulated by the Freight Bureau of the Ministry of Railways for consignment and transportation not carried out according to the plan stated that if the consignor did not carry out consignment according to the plan within ten days, they would be fined by the Ministry of Railways; if the Ministry of Railways did not transport the consignor's goods within twenty days according to the plan, they would also be fined to the consignor. The same matter, both were fines, but the time was different, which was obviously unreasonable. The Ministry of Railways has recently accepted the consignor's opinion and changed this penalty system to be calculated in ten days for both the consignor and the Ministry of Railways.

    便利群众　有利生产
    铁道部改革不合理的规章制度
    本报讯　铁道部在整风运动中修改了一些不合理、不切实际的规章制度，为进一步提高群众的积极性和发展生产扫清障碍。仅铁道部车辆局、工务局、货运局、旅客局四个单位就已经修改和废除了百多条陈旧的规章制度。
    有些不合理的规章制度是保守思想造成的。它束缚了生产的发展，如车辆局过分强调安全、怕车辆损害率大等，把许多货车标记载重（即货车上有一个可装载多少吨的标记）都规定的较低，如X66型货车原设计载重是四十五吨，标记载重却规定为四十吨，而且不许增载。对于这条规定，几年来特别是在整风运动中，铁道部其他各局和现场许多单位根据实际情况要求车辆局修改货车的标记载重。现在车辆局根据各方面提出来的意见，立即着手进行技术研究和试验，并为此问题在车辆局内进行了大辩论。研究和辩论的结果证明：目前全国可以实行增载的货车有三十九种，计四万八千四百十四辆，可以增载一吨到五吨不等。总计用这些车辆一次即可增加载重七万零五百二十七吨。按1957年全国货车平均标记载重为三十八点六吨，经增载后，每辆货车平均标记载重可提高到三十九点四吨，相当于增加一千七百九十辆货车。最近铁道部已经拟好修改过去货车标记载重的部令。
    许多订得过细过死的规章制度，在整风中也都做了修改。如工务局制定的线路大修工作范围中规定：在直线地段，每公里应铺设枕木一千六百根或一千八百四十根。而没有根据线路的具体情况规定铺设枕木的具体数字。有些直线地段虽然不必铺一千八百四十根枕木，但铺一千六百根枕木又不足，而一千六百根和一千八百四十根之间又无其他级数，因此只好一律铺设一千八百四十根枕木，造成很大浪费。工务局现在已经根据群众的意见，修改了这项规定，在一千六百根和一千八百四十根之间增加了一千七百六十根一数。车辆局也把过去客车每年年修一次的规定，修改为按现在车辆实际状况进行年修。
    许多给下面执行人员增加麻烦又不利于生产的规章制度，也都做了实事求是的修改。如旅客局制定的“旅客、行李和包裹运送规则”规定：包裹的每件重量，不能超过八十公斤，过重时，需经铁路管理局承认。徒给下边增加麻烦，又助长管理局的事务主义。现在这条规定已经修改。
    有一些不合理和不利于协作的规章制度，也都进行了修改。如铁道部货运局原来规定的不按计划进行托运和运送的罚款制度规定：货主在十天内不按计划进行托运要出罚款给铁道部；铁道部在二十天内不按计划把货主的货物运出，也罚款给货主。同样的事，都是罚款，但时间却长短不同，这显然是不合理的。铁道部最近已经接受货主意见，把这项罚款制度改为货主和铁道部都以十天计算。
