Organize Socialist Collaboration to Guarantee the Overall Great Leap Forward
--Shanxi Daily Editorial, March 7th

Currently, the objective situation we face is a new situation of an all-round Great Leap Forward with ten thousand horses galloping forward. The Great Leap Forward in agriculture is promoting the Great Leap Forward in industry, and the Great Leap Forward in industry is supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture. The unprecedented high tide of economic construction that has already emerged is arousing and promoting a high tide of cultural revolution. In the giant waves of leap forward and further leap forward, new socialist things are constantly emerging every day, every hour, and in every corner; all backward ideas, conservative plans, unreasonable rules and regulations, etc., are constantly being impacted. We are excited to see that both the spiritual outlook of society and the face of material production are changing rapidly. However, this new situation also poses many new problems for us. The most common and prominent problem is the large-scale emergence of contradictions and new imbalances between the advanced and the backward in industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, etc., as well as between them. In this situation, what attitude and methods should all leading organs adopt? Either warmly welcome advanced things and new imbalances, and adapt to the needs of the situation, strengthen overall planning, organize comprehensive collaboration, and strive for an overall Great Leap Forward; or hesitate and waver in the face of new imbalances, fear the leap forward, accommodate the backward, and stick to conventions. Obviously, the former is the attitude and method that promoters should adopt, while the latter is the performance of regressives. The Taiyuan Municipal Party and government leading organs held a city-wide collaboration meeting last month, providing an important experience on how to strive for an overall Great Leap Forward.

Convening collaboration meetings and organizing socialist collaboration is not news. As far as Taiyuan City is concerned, collaboration meetings have been held every year during the first five-year plan period. However, the scope, content, methods, and role of this year's collaboration meeting are far beyond comparison with any previous collaboration meeting. It marks that socialist collaboration has entered a new stage of development. In the past, the organization of collaboration was often limited to some production factories and mines, key construction units, and transportation departments. However, the scope of this organized collaboration not only includes all aspects of the city's industrial production, capital construction, transportation, handicrafts, finance, banking, commerce, suburban agriculture, culture and education, etc., but is also gradually and systematically expanding to the rural areas of the entire province. In the past, the organization of collaboration was often regarded as a temporary measure to solve certain difficulties in production and construction or mutual "wrangling" problems. However, this time, the organization of collaboration not only made overall plans and unified arrangements, but also many participating units have established relatively fixed collaborative relationships, which has made collaboration begin to move towards regularization and institutionalization. In the past, the organization of collaboration was only to ensure the realization of already determined plans, without involving the issue of the plan itself. However, this time, the organization of collaboration, in an atmosphere full of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced," promoted and supported each other, prompting the leap forward plan to become even more of a leap forward, which made the collaboration meeting play the role of a planning meeting. In the past, the organization of collaboration often dealt with business issues in isolation. Due to the lack of politics, many people participating in the collaboration meeting always held the mentality of "fear of suffering losses," not telling the truth, holding back, and bargaining, so that the collaboration did not achieve the due effect. However, this time, the organization of collaboration, on the basis of rectification, adopted a method of combining politics and business, first enabling everyone to have a clear and unified understanding of the overall situation and the significance of organizing collaboration, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, sweeping away the vulgar atmosphere of the past, and creating a new ethos of "supporting others is glorious, and departmentalism is shameful." This not only enabled a large number of specific issues that needed collaboration to be resolved quickly and smoothly through various professional collaboration meetings, but also made this collaboration meeting, in fact, a rectification meeting against conservatism, waste, and departmentalism.

It should be sufficiently estimated that the experience of Taiyuan City in convening collaboration meetings and organizing large-scale socialist collaboration has universal and far-reaching significance.

The experience of Taiyuan City proves that doing a good job in collaboration has a unique and significant role in practicing thrift and opposing waste. Of course, there are many ways to practice thrift and oppose waste, but the savings achieved through collaboration are not only broad and large in quantity, but also cannot be replaced by other methods. In industrial cities, there is a common and frequent phenomenon, that is, some enterprises have serious shortages of labor, transportation capacity, technical strength, raw materials, and machinery and equipment, while on the contrary, some enterprises have surpluses; some production factories and mines and capital construction units need machinery and equipment and components that local factories can manufacture, and these factories have insufficient production tasks, but they have to abandon the near and seek the far, and go to other places to place orders. Aren't these the biggest wastes? This phenomenon of one side being insufficient and the other side being surplus, one side abandoning the near and seeking the far and the other side not having enough to eat, is even more prominent in the current situation of the Great Leap Forward. Taiyuan City's organization of city-wide collaboration has reversed this situation. For example, after organizing collaboration, the Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant no longer had to "abandon the near and seek the far" to order the non-standard castings it needed from other places. The freight alone saved more than 180,000 yuan, and it could also speed up the progress of the project. At the same time, it could enable some local state-owned and joint state-private machinery factories to solve the difficulty of insufficient production tasks and be able to leap forward by leaps and bounds. For example, after a collaboration meeting, the city's labor needs were preliminarily balanced, and more than 14,000 temporary workers could be recruited from the society throughout the year. If calculated at 300 yuan per person per year, the state could pay 4.22 million yuan less. In short, many problems that various enterprises were originally unable to solve themselves can be solved through collaboration. This is naturally a great saving of manpower, material resources, and financial resources for the country.

The experience of Taiyuan City proves that holding collaboration meetings well can thoroughly break through the conservative ideas of some people. Here we are referring to two types of people: one type of people, in the face of the new situation, often show hesitation and wavering due to lack of confidence and lack of methods, or only dare to make small leaps forward, but not large leaps forward; the other type of people are vulgar balancers, they emphasize balance and fear imbalance, and the balance they emphasize is a static, stagnant balance, which is to pull the advanced towards the backward. The common point of these two types of people is that they neither see the great creativity of the masses nor understand the law of unbalanced development of all things. Therefore, they have many concerns and are at a loss in the face of difficulties. One of the most significant gains of this Taiyuan City collaboration meeting was that these people with conservative ideas, through learning from the advanced and comparing with the advanced, understood that the Great Leap Forward will inevitably lead to great imbalances, which is not surprising, but is an excellent thing. Imbalance means that advanced things have broken through the old balance. As long as measures are taken to learn from the advanced, a new balance can be achieved at the advanced level. And each time a new balance is achieved at the advanced level, the productive forces will have a new leap forward. Of course, this new balance can only be relative and temporary, and it will inevitably be broken through again soon, and new imbalances will appear again. Social productive forces are constantly developing forward in this way. The practice of collaboration has also made these people with conservative ideas realize that organizing together will generate new productive forces. The various enterprises in an industrial city, after being organized through collaboration, will generate new productive forces that cannot be generated by various enterprises in the case of working alone. The fact that the total value of industrial production in Taiyuan City this year increased by more than 20% over the actual growth rate of 1957, and rapidly increased to more than 50% during the meeting through the organization of collaboration and a series of other measures, is the most powerful proof. In short, many people who originally lacked confidence and lacked methods have gained confidence and methods because they have broken through conservative ideas.

The experience of Taiyuan City proves that holding collaboration meetings well can not only balance the plans of various aspects of the national economy and enable them to be connected with each other, but more importantly, it can also enable the plans of various aspects of the national economy to be formulated more advanced and more in line with reality under the conditions of mutual support and mutual promotion. This raises a new issue worthy of attention for our planning work. As everyone knows, the planned and proportionate development of the national economy is the objective law of the socialist economy. We must strive to make our plans conform to the actual situation and conform to objective laws that do not transfer with people's will. Only in this way can planning work promote the development of productive forces, otherwise it will, to some extent, restrict and delay the development of productive forces. The so-called advanced plan is a plan that is more in line with the actual situation and more in line with objective laws. In the past, we formulated plans only by relying on various departments to issue control figures from top to bottom, and then concentrated them from bottom to top, and then comprehensively balanced them by the planning department. Doing so is certainly necessary, but relying solely on departments to formulate plans will inevitably have a certain degree of limitations and one-sidedness, because the plans formulated in this way only mechanically integrate the productive forces of various scattered enterprises, and cannot include the new productive forces that can be generated by organizing them to implement collaboration. The experience of Taiyuan City shows that relying on blocks and holding collaboration meetings is an effective way to overcome this limitation and one-sidedness in planning work. It can be affirmed that holding collaboration meetings well can not only play a balancing role for the plans of various aspects of the national economy, but also play a promoting role. Therefore, when formulating plans every year, collaboration meetings should be held to organize comprehensive collaboration; in the process of implementing plans, collaboration meetings should also be held to ensure the realization of plans. In short, closely combining planning work with the organization of collaboration has great significance for the improvement of planning work. Of course, the experience of Taiyuan City is only preliminary, and we need to further study and develop it in our actual work.

In summary, organizing large-scale socialist collaboration not only has practical and urgent significance for ensuring the current overall Great Leap Forward, but also has great and far-reaching significance for improving planning work. May I ask, can all cadres recognize the significance of collaboration in this way? No, the facts prove that although some cadres also feel the benefits of collaboration, they do not deeply understand that collaboration is the essence of socialism and a universal principle of building socialism. Therefore, they do not yet have sufficient consciousness and initiative in implementing collaboration. There are still many cadres who cannot understand the significance of collaboration mentioned above because of the serious departmentalism in their minds. Collaboration and departmentalism are opposed to each other and are absolutely incompatible. For all those who have departmentalist ideas, it should be emphasized to point out to them that the attitude towards collaboration is essentially the attitude towards socialism, and the question of whether they are willing to collaborate is essentially the question of whether they are willing to develop socialist productive forces.

We hope that all enterprises, cooperatives, organs, and schools in the province will organize socialist collaboration and expand socialist collaboration to all aspects of production, work, and life; we hope that the leading organs in various regions will widely organize collaboration between industry, agriculture, handicrafts and commerce, between cultural and educational health departments and economic departments, between regions, between urban and rural areas, between departments and blocks...; we hope that all industrial cities in the province will earnestly learn from Taiyuan's practices and consciously and systematically organize city-wide collaboration; we hope that Taiyuan City, this comprehensive industrial base, will further develop its experience and expand the scope of collaboration to the entire province, and more powerfully support and guarantee the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production throughout the province.

    组织社会主义大协作，保证全面大跃进
    ——山西日报三月七日社论
    目前，我们面对着的客观形势，是一个万马奔腾的全面大跃进的新形势。农业的大跃进推动着工业的大跃进，而工业的大跃进又支援农业的大跃进；已经出现的史无前例的经济建设的高潮，正在引起和推动着文化革命的高潮。在跃进再跃进的巨浪中，每日每时每个角落，都在不断地涌现出社会主义的新事情；一切落后的思想、保守的计划、不合理的规章制度等等，也都在不断地被冲击着。我们兴奋地看到，社会的精神面貌和物质生产的面貌都在飞快地变化着。但是，这个新的形势也给我们提出了许多新的问题。最普遍最突出的问题是，在工业、农业、交通运输业、商业、文教事业等等方面以及它们相互之间，大量地出现着先进与落后之间的矛盾和新的不平衡现象。在这种情况下，一切领导机关应该采取什么态度和办法呢？或者是对于先进的事物和新的不平衡现象表示热烈欢迎，并且适应形势的需要，加强全面规划，组织全面协作，力争全面大跃进；或者是在新的不平衡现象的面前犹豫徘徊，惧怕跃进，迁就落后，墨守陈规。很显然，前者是促进派所应该采取的态度和办法，而后者则是促退派的表现。太原市的党政领导机关在上月召开的全市规模的协作会议，对如何力争全面大跃进，提供了一个重要的经验。
    召开协作会议，组织社会主义协作，这并不是新闻。就太原市来说，在第一个五年计划期间，每年都开过协作会议。但是，今年召开的这次协作会议，无论在协作的范围、内容、方法、作用等方面，都远非过去任何一次协作会议所能比拟，它标志着社会主义协作已经进到了一个新的发展阶段。过去组织协作，往往局限于部分生产厂矿、重点建设单位、交通运输部门之间，而这次组织协作的范围，不但包括全市的工业生产、基本建设、交通运输、手工业、财政、金融、商业、郊区农业、文教等各个方面，而且正在逐步地有计划地向全省农村扩展。过去组织协作，人们往往把它当作一种临时性的措施，用以解决生产建设中的某些困难，或相互之间的“扯皮”问题，而这次组织协作，不但作了全面规划，统一安排，而且许多参加协作的单位已建立了比较固定的协作关系，这就使协作开始走向经常化、制度化。过去组织协作，仅仅为了保证已经确定了的计划的实现，没有涉及到计划本身的问题，而这次组织协作，在充满“学先进、赶先进”的气氛中，各单位相互推动，相互支援，促使跃进计划更加跃进，这就使协作会议起到了计划会议的作用。过去组织协作，往往就事论事，孤立地处理业务问题。由于缺乏政治，许多人参加协作会议，总是抱着“怕吃亏”的心理，不说实话、留一手、讨价还价，使协作得不到应有的效果。而这次组织协作，在整风的基础上，采取政治与业务相结合的方法，首先使大家对于全局情况和组织协作的意义有明确的统一的认识，开展批评与自我批评，一扫过去那种庸俗的空气，造成“支援别人光荣，本位主义可耻”的新风尚，这就不但使大量的需要协作的具体问题，通过各种专业协作会议得到迅速的顺利的解决，而且也使这次协作会议，实际上成为一次反保守、反浪费、反本位主义的整风会议。
    应该足够估计，太原市召开协作会议，组织社会主义大协作的经验，具有普遍的深远的意义。
    太原市的经验证明，做好协作，对于厉行节约、反对浪费，有着独特的重大的作用。当然，厉行节约、反对浪费的办法是很多的，但是通过协作所取得的节约的效果，不但面广数量大，而且是其他办法所不能代替的。在工业城市中，普遍地经常地存在这样的现象，就是有些企业的劳动力、运输力、技术力量、原材料和机器设备等严重不足，相反的，另有些企业又有剩余；有些生产厂矿和基本建设单位所需要的机器设备和构件，本地工厂能够制造，这些工厂生产任务又不足，但是，他们却要舍近求远，到外地去订货。这些不都是最大的浪费吗？这种一面不足、一面剩余，一面舍近求远、一面吃不饱的现象，在当前大跃进的形势下暴露得更突出了。太原市组织全市范围的大协作，就扭转了这种局面。比如太原肥料厂，经过组织协作，因为需要的非标准铸件不必再“舍近求远”到外地去订货，仅运费一项就节约了十八万元之多，并且可以加快工程进度，同时可以使一些地方国营和公私合营的机器厂，解决了生产任务不足的困难，得以大步向前跃进。又如经过协作会议，全市所需要的劳动力作了初步的平衡，全年可以从社会上少招用临时工一万四千余名，如果以每人一年三百元工资计算，国家即可少付四百二十余万元的支出。总之，各个企业自己原来无力解决的许多问题，通过协作都是可以得到解决的。这对国家来说，自然是人力、物力、财力莫大的节约。
    太原市的经验证明，开好协作会议，可以彻底地攻破一部分人的保守思想。我们在这里指的有两种人：一种人在新的形势面前，由于缺乏信心，缺少办法，常常表现犹豫动摇，或者只敢小跃进，不敢大跃进；另一种人是庸俗的平衡论者，他们强调平衡，惧怕不平衡，而他们所强调的平衡，却是静止的死水一潭的平衡，是要把先进拉向落后的平衡。这两种人的共同点，是既看不到群众的伟大创造力，又不懂得一切事物的不平衡的发展规律。因而他们在困难面前顾虑多端，束手无策。这次太原市协作会议最重大的收获之一，就是使这些有保守思想的人，通过学先进、比先进，懂得了大跃进必然出现大不平衡，这不但没有什么可奇怪的，而且是极好的事情。不平衡就是先进事物突破了旧的平衡，只要采取措施向先进看齐，就可以在先进的水平上达到新的平衡。而每次在先进的水平上达到新的平衡，就使生产力有一个新的跃进。当然，这种新的平衡也只能是相对的、暂时的，它必然很快再被突破，又出现新的不平衡。社会生产力正是这样不断地向前发展。协作的实践还使这些有保守思想的人认识到，组织起来会产生新的生产力。一个工业城市中的各个企业，经过协作组织起来，就会产生各个企业在单干的情况下所不可能产生的新的生产力。太原市今年工业生产总值比1957年的实际增长率，在会议期间，经过组织协作及其他一系列措施，由20％以上迅速提高到50％以上，便是最有力的证明。总之，许多原来缺乏信心缺少办法的人，由于打破了保守思想，都有了信心和办法了。
    太原市的经验证明，开好协作会议，不但可以平衡国民经济各个方面的计划，使它们能够相互衔接，而且更重要的，还可以在互相支援互相促进的条件下，使国民经济各个方面的计划制订得更加先进，更加切合实际。这就给我们的计划工作提出了一个值得重视的新问题。大家知道，国民经济有计划按比例的发展，是社会主义经济的客观规律。我们制订计划，必须力求符合实际情况，符合不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。只有这样，计划工作才能推动生产力的发展，否则就会在某种程度上束缚和迟滞生产力的发展。所谓先进的计划，就是比较符合实际情况的计划，比较符合客观规律的计划。过去我们制订计划，只是依靠各个部门，自上而下地颁布控制数字，又自下而上地集中起来，然后经过计划部门综合平衡。这样做固然是必要的，但是，单单依靠条条制订计划，势必有一定程度的局限性和片面性，因为这样制订出来的计划，只是把各个分散的企业的生产力机械地综合起来，而不能包括把它们组织起来实行协作所可能产生的新的生产力。太原市的经验表明，依靠块块，召开协作会议，是克服计划工作中这种局限性和片面性的一项行之有效的办法。可以肯定，开好协作会议，对于国民经济各个方面的计划来说，不仅可以起到平衡的作用，而且还可以起到促进的作用。因此，每年制订计划的时候，应该召开协作会议，组织全面大协作；在贯彻执行计划的过程中，也应该召开协作会议，保证计划的实现。总之，把计划工作和组织协作密切结合起来，对计划工作的改进，具有重大的意义，当然，太原市的经验还只是初步的，需要我们在实际工作中进一步研究和发展。
    综上所述，组织社会主义大协作，不但对保证当前全面大跃进具有现实的迫切的意义，而且对于改进计划工作具有重大的深远的意义。试问，是不是所有的干部都能这样来认识协作的意义呢？不，事实证明，有些干部尽管也感到协作的好处，但是他们并没有深刻理解到，协作是社会主义的本质，是建设社会主义的一个普遍原则。因而他们对实行协作还没有足够的自觉性和主动性。还有不少干部，由于他们思想上存在着严重的本位主义，因而他们就不可能理解上面所说的协作的意义。协作和本位主义是对立的，是绝对不相容的。对于一切有本位主义思想的人，应该强调向他们指出，对待协作的态度实质上也就是对待社会主义的态度，愿不愿意协作的问题，实质上也就是愿不愿意发展社会主义生产力的问题。
    我们希望，全省一切企业、合作社、机关、学校，都来组织社会主义协作，把社会主义协作扩展到生产、工作、生活的各个方面；希望各个地区的领导机关，在工业、农业、手工业与商业之间，文教卫生部门与经济部门之间，地区与地区之间，城乡之间，条条与块块之间……广泛组织协作；希望全省各个工业城市认真学习太原的做法，自觉地有计划地组织全市范围的协作；希望太原市这个综合性的工业基地，进一步发展自己的经验，把协作范围扩展到全省，更有力地支援和保证全省工农业生产的大跃进。
