Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: According to TASS on March 27th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, told the French "Le Figaro" reporter Groussard that we sincerely hope that France will become a prosperous and strong country. We do not want it to weaken, but hope it consolidates its dignity. He said that if France can show more independence and autonomy as a great power, it will be easier to solve many European and world problems that need to be solved with common efforts.

Khrushchev pointed out that people have the impression that France's policy on many issues is subordinate to the United States. He hopes that France will get rid of the policies that make its own country increasingly weaker. He said that changes in French foreign policy would help enhance France's prestige on the international stage and its role among the world's major powers.

Khrushchev received the French reporter in Moscow on March 19 and spoke with him.

Khrushchev said that whether France can become a prosperous and strong country depends to a large extent on whether future international relations develop along the path of easing tensions or along the path of continuing the "Cold War."

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people have long respected France and have a sincere friendship with it. This friendship is long-standing and has a solid foundation. The Soviet people respect the French people because they have a creative genius and a tradition of loving freedom.

Khrushchev pointed out that it should be frankly said that the Soviet people find it difficult to understand the policies pursued by the leaders of France today. The French ruling circles often make France do things that violate national interests and reason. France's worsening relations with the Soviet Union also put it in a weak position in its relations with West Germany, Britain, and the United States. We are very sorry for this situation and regret not getting the understanding that France deserves.

Referring to the Algerian issue, Khrushchev pointed out that it would be a wiser attitude if the French could be as understanding on this issue as the British were towards India and Burma. Khrushchev said that we advocate a fair solution to the Algerian issue and meeting the aspirations of the Algerian people.

Khrushchev believes that it is necessary to develop closer cultural and economic ties between the Soviet Union and France. Economic cooperation should not be limited to trade. He said that some decisions were made last year on strengthening Soviet-French ties, but these decisions have yet to be implemented, which is regrettable, and both sides must strive to develop broader contacts.

Referring to the possibility of the Soviet Union building communism under capitalist encirclement, Khrushchev asked the French reporter to note that the concept of "capitalist encirclement" itself needs to be well-defined. Khrushchev said that it is now difficult to say who is encircling whom. Of the 2.5 billion people in the world, 1 billion live in socialist countries. Since the formation of the world socialist system, the world situation has undergone fundamental changes that are unfavorable to capitalism. Therefore, the concept of capitalist encirclement cannot be understood in the same way as in the past.

Referring to the activities of the United Nations, Khrushchev said that it is a useful tool and is doing something in resolving international issues. But one cannot close one's eyes and not see that certain influential members of the United Nations are trying to issue orders to other countries, forcing them to accept a diplomatic line that has little in common with the lofty purposes and tasks of the United Nations. Under such circumstances, the United Nations cannot become a truly international cooperation organization. Khrushchev said that we believe that the United Nations must be strengthened in the future so that it can finally become a more effective international cooperation agency.

Khrushchev recalled a series of actions taken by the Soviet government recently for peace, and he said that we expect Western countries to finally follow this path.

Referring to the possibility of the Soviet Union frequently assisting underdeveloped countries, Khrushchev said that we believe that as long as international tensions are eased, all countries can save a considerable amount of money from the money now used for armaments and armed forces to provide underdeveloped countries with practical and vigorous assistance. As long as underdeveloped countries seek help from the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will do its best to help. Our future policy will be the same. We advocate selfless and genuine assistance to underdeveloped countries so that they can get rid of backwardness and become increasingly economically self-reliant.

The French reporter asked him whether material achievements would eliminate social differences and national divides, and whether there would be a day when political contradictions would lose any meaning.

Khrushchev emphasized that social differences and national divides are the product of the class structure of bourgeois society. Only under a socialist society, without capitalists, landlords, and other exploiting groups, without racists and colonialists, will these differences and divides disappear. Therefore, the issue is not the material progress of society, but the social conditions in social development.

Answering another question, Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has made many efforts to develop international tourism. He also said that if an agreement can be reached on disarmament and international tensions can be greatly eased, and full trust can be established in relations between countries, there is no doubt that restrictions on the movement of foreigners in the Soviet Union or other European countries can be completely lifted without any obstacles, and perhaps restrictions on the unimpeded entry of foreigners into these countries can also be lifted.

Regarding the significance of the first artificial earth satellites, Khrushchev said that scientists have no doubt that humans will be able to travel to other stars in the near future. He continued, we welcome the United States to launch an artificial earth satellite. We hope that this event, like the Soviet Union's launch of a satellite, will be conducive to the cause of peace and the progress of all mankind.

### 赫鲁晓夫谈苏法关系  苏联希望法国表现大国的自主  阿尔及利亚人民的正当愿望应得到满足

    赫鲁晓夫谈苏法关系
    苏联希望法国表现大国的自主
    阿尔及利亚人民的正当愿望应得到满足
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社27日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫对法国“费加罗报”记者格鲁萨尔说，我们真诚地希望法国成为繁荣昌盛的强国。我们不希望它削弱，而希望它巩固它的尊严。他说，如果法国能够更多地表现出大国的独立自主，那就会更容易地用共同的力量来解决许多早就需要解决的欧洲和世界问题。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，人们有这样一种印象：法国在很多问题上的政策屈从于美国。他希望法国摆脱促使自己国家越来越衰弱的政策。他说，法国外交政策的改变会有助于提高法国在国际舞台上的威望以及在世界各大国中的作用。
    赫鲁晓夫在3月19日在莫斯科接见了这位法国记者，并且同他谈了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，法国要成为繁荣昌盛的强国，这在很大程度上取决于今后国际关系是沿缓和紧张局势的道路发展，还是沿继续“冷战”的道路发展。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民很久以来就尊敬法国，对它怀着真挚的友谊。这种友谊是久远的，基础是牢固的。苏联人民尊敬法国人民，是因为他们有着创造天才和爱自由的传统。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，应当坦白地说，苏联人民很难理解今日法国的领导人所奉行的政策。法国的统治集团常常使法国做那些违反民族利益、违反理智的事情。法国把同苏联的关系搞坏，也就使自己在同西德、英国、美国的关系中处于软弱的地位。我们对这种局面的形成感到十分遗憾，对得不到法国的应有的理解感到遗憾。
    谈到阿尔及利亚问题时，赫鲁晓夫指出，如果法国人在这个问题上能够像英国对待印度和缅甸那样谅解，这将是一种比较明智的态度。赫鲁晓夫说，我们主张公正地解决阿尔及利亚问题，满足阿尔及利亚人民的愿望。
    赫鲁晓夫相信，发展苏法之间在文化和经济方面的更加密切的联系是必要的。经济合作不应当仅限于贸易方面。他说，去年曾经就加强苏法联系问题通过一些决定，但是这些决定至今仍然是有待实现，这是令人遗憾的，双方必须努力更广泛地发展接触。
    谈到苏联在资本主义包围下建成共产主义的可能性时，赫鲁晓夫请法国记者注意，现在“资本主义包围”这个概念本身需要很好地明确一下。赫鲁晓夫说，现在很难说是谁在包围谁。全世界二十五亿人口当中住在社会主义国家的有十亿，自从世界社会主义体系形成后，世界的局面就发生了不利于资本主义的根本变化。所以根本不能像过去那样来理解资本主义包围这个概念。
    谈到联合国的活动，赫鲁晓夫说，它是一个有用处的工具，在解决国际问题方面它是在做一些事情的。但是不能闭起眼睛不看到：某些有影响的联合国会员国企图对其他国家发号施令，强迫它们接受那种同联合国的崇高宗旨和任务很少有共同之处的外交路线，联合国处在这种情况下当然就不能成为名副其实的国际合作组织。赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，今后必须加强联合国，使它终于能成为一个更有效的国际合作机构。
    赫鲁晓夫追述了苏联政府近来采取的一系列为了和平的行动，他说，我们期待西方国家终于也会沿这条道路走去。
    谈到苏联经常援助不发达国家的可能性的问题，赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，只要国际紧张局势有所缓和，各国就可以从现在用于军备和武装力量上面的钱中节省出相当大一笔数目来给不发达国家以实际的大力的援助。不发达国家只要向苏联求助，苏联都是尽力帮助的。我们将来的政策也是这样。我们主张对不发达国家进行无私的、真正的援助，使它们能够摆脱落后状态，在经济上也能日益巩固地自力更生。
    法国记者请他谈谈物质上的成就是否会使社会差别和民族鸿沟消失，是否会有那么一天使政治矛盾失去任何意义。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，社会差别和民族鸿沟是资产阶级社会阶级结构的产物。只有在社会主义社会之下，没有了资本家、大地主和其他剥削集团，没有了种族主义者和殖民主义者，这些差别和鸿沟才会消失。因此，问题不在于社会的物质进步，而在于社会发展中的社会条件。
    赫鲁晓夫在回答另一个问题的时候说，苏联政府为发展国际游览事业作了不少努力。他还说，如果能就裁军问题达成协议，国际紧张局势能够大大缓和下来，各国关系中能够建立起充分的信任，毫无疑问那就可以毫无障碍地根本取消对外国人在苏联或其他欧洲国家领土上往来的限制，或许还可以取消对外国人无阻地进入这些国家的限制。
    关于第一批人造地球卫星的意义问题，赫鲁晓夫说，科学家们毫不怀疑，人类在不久的将来就可以进行星际旅行。他继续说，我们欢迎美国发射人造地球卫星。我们希望，这个事件也像苏联发射卫星一样，有利于和平和全人类进步的事业。
