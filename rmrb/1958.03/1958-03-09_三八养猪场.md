    "March 8th" Pig Farm
    The Eleventh Agricultural Cooperative of Gaobeidian Township, Eastern District of Beijing, established a women's pig farm yesterday. Based on the demands of the female commune members, it was named the "March 8th" Pig Farm. Four eighteen-year-old girls voluntarily signed up to be feeders. The farm currently has eighty-eight piglets. The cooperative's Great Leap Forward plan is to expand to 30,000 pigs by the end of this year, and build eight farms to raise them.
    The picture above shows the feeders asking veteran pig farmers for technical guidance.

    “三八养猪场”
    北京市东郊区高碑店乡十一农业社在昨天成立了一个妇女养猪场，根据女社员们的要求就命名为“三八养猪场”。四位十八岁的同年姑娘自动报名当了饲养员，这个场现在养子猪八十八口，这个社的大跃进计划中准备在今年底将发展到三万口猪，分建八个场饲养。
    上图是饲养员们在请老饲养员作技术指导。
