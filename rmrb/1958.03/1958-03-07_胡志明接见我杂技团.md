Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th: President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam received all members of the Chinese Qiqihar Acrobatics Troupe at the Presidential Palace on the morning of the 6th and had a cordial conversation with them. He Wei, the Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, was present at the reception.

President Ho Chi Minh inquired in detail about the actors' living conditions. When some of the young actors presented President Ho Chi Minh with a "Simplified Tai Chi Chart" and several booklets on boxing techniques, he picked them up and kissed them repeatedly. President Ho Chi Minh learned Tai Chi last year.

On the evening of the 5th, the acrobatics troupe held its premiere performance at the Hanoi People's Open-Air Theater. Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, foreign diplomatic envoys to Vietnam, and more than six thousand other people braved the rain to watch the sixteen wonderful acts in the performance.

The acrobatics troupe also held a forum with Hanoi journalists and acrobatics circles on the morning of the 6th.
