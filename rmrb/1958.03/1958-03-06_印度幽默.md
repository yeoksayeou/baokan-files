    A father took his son to have a tooth pulled. After the dentist performed the procedure, he said to the father:
    "That will be five rupees, please."
    "Five rupees?" the father exclaimed in surprise. "Don't you only charge one rupee per patient?"
    "That's right," the doctor replied, "but your son screamed so loudly while having his tooth pulled that he scared away the four patients who were waiting in the waiting room."
                                （Translated by Wang Xiuzhong）

    父亲带儿子去拔牙。牙医动了手术以后，对父亲说道：
    “请您付五个卢比。”
    “五个卢比？”父亲吃惊了：“您不是对每位病人只收一个卢比吗？”
    “不错。”医生回答说：“可是，您的儿子在拔牙的时候，叫得太厉害，把候诊室里排队的四位病人全吓跑了。”
                （王秀中译）
