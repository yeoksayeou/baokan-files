Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. Before leaving Beijing, Matsuyama Mikiko, deputy head of the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, spoke to a reporter from this agency about her impressions of performing in Beijing, expressing her desire to work harder to strengthen Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and friendship between the two peoples.

Matsuyama Mikiko said that with all the sensitivity of an actress and more than 20 years of stage experience, she deeply felt that the Chinese audience genuinely welcomed the performances of the Japanese artists. She said that what moved her the most was that, whether they were people in Chinese literary and art circles or ordinary audience members, they not only regarded the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe's performance with an appreciative eye, but also eagerly sought to learn something beneficial to themselves from their artistic practice. Matsuyama Mikiko believes that only people who truly love art, understand life, and adore peace can have such an attitude towards a foreign art troupe.

Matsuyama Mikiko is the actress who plays "Xi'er," the female lead in the ballet "The White-Haired Girl." She said, "In every performance we gave in China, we received new encouragement and inspiration from the audience's reaction." She also said excitedly, "I love Xi'er's character, and the warm welcome from the Chinese audience to our performance makes me even more determined to shape this artistic image even better, to thank them for their kindness."

Matsuyama Mikiko also used the Japanese audience's appreciation of "The White-Haired Girl" to prove that Chinese and Japanese cultures have always had close ties. She said that "The White-Haired Girl" has been performed more than 40 times in Japan, and has received more and more praise from all sides. Many writers, after watching their performances, were so moved that they ran backstage with tears in their eyes to hug them. A large number of letters from strangers all over Japan were sent to praise and encourage them, saying that they were performing events that happened around the audience themselves.

Matsuyama Mikiko said: "This situation shows that 'The White-Haired Girl' has an essential connection with Japanese farmers. 'The White-Haired Girl's' hatred is not only the hatred of the Chinese people, but also the hatred of the Japanese people and the people of the world. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the ballet 'The White-Haired Girl,' adapted from a Chinese opera, is also warmly welcomed by Japanese audiences."

Matsuyama Mikiko said, "Chinese and Japanese cultures and the people of the two countries have many centuries of traditional ties, but it is a pity that the Japanese people still cannot freely communicate with New China for various reasons." She finally expressed her deep gratitude for the warm reception she received in China, and believed that faithfully conveying the various situations she saw in China to the Japanese people in order to strengthen Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and the friendship between the two peoples is the responsibility of all members of the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe.

### 努力加强中日文化交流和两国人民友好  松山树子谈在北京演出的感想

    努力加强中日文化交流和两国人民友好
    松山树子谈在北京演出的感想
    新华社24日讯　日本松山芭蕾舞团副团长松山树子在离开北京以前向本社记者谈到了在北京演出的感想，表示要更好地为加强中日文化交流和两国人民友好而努力。
    松山树子说，她以一个演员所有的敏感和二十多年的舞台经验，深切地感觉到中国观众确实是真诚地欢迎日本艺术家们的演出。她说，使她最感动的是，不论中国文艺界人士或者是一个普通的观众，都不仅是以欣赏的眼光来看待松山芭蕾舞团的表演，而且是热忱地企求从他们的艺术实践中学习到一些对自己有益的东西。松山树子认为，只有真正热爱艺术懂得生活和酷爱和平的人民，才可能对一个外国的艺术团体抱有这样的态度。
    松山树子是芭蕾舞剧“白毛女”女主角“喜儿”的扮演者。她说：“我们在中国的每一场演出，都从观众的反映中得到了新的鼓舞和启发。”她还激动地说：“我热爱喜儿的性格，中国观众对我们的演出的热情欢迎，更使得我决心要把这个艺术形象塑造得更好，来答谢他们的盛情。”
    松山树子还以日本观众对“白毛女”的赞赏，来证明中日两国文化本来就有着密切的联系。她说，“白毛女”在日本已演出四十多次，并且从各方面得到了越来越多的好评。许多作家在看了他们的演出以后，感动得含着泪跑到后台拥抱他们。从日本各地寄来大批不相识者的信件，赞扬和鼓励他们说，他们演出了观众自己身边所发生的事情。
    松山树子说：“这种情况说明，‘白毛女’与日本农民有着本质的联系。‘白毛女’的憎恨不仅是中国人民的憎恨，同时也是日本人民和世界人民的憎恨。也许正是因为这样，由中国歌剧改编的舞剧‘白毛女’，才同样受到日本观众的热烈欢迎。”
    松山树子说：“中日文化和两国人民有着许多世纪的传统联系，但是日本人民现在还由于种种原因不能完全同新中国自由来往，这是很遗憾的事情。”她最后还对在中国所受到的盛情接待深表感谢，并且认为把中国所见到的各种情况忠实地传达给日本人民，以加强中日文化交流和两国人民的友谊，是松山芭蕾舞团全体人员所应尽的责任。
