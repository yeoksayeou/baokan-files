    Water-powered Automatic Winch

    For agricultural cooperatives in river valley areas, what is the best way to pump water up slopes that are 20 to 100 meters high and 200 meters away? One solution is to use the "Water-powered Automatic Winch" created by the Fourth Engineering Section of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. It uses the natural force of the river water to power a wooden waterwheel, which then drives the rope through three small wooden wheels. The water bucket is attached to the rope, which then lifts the water to the higher ground. It can automatically load, transport, and unload the water without human intervention. According to tests conducted by the 23rd team of the 16th Engineering Area of the Fourth Engineering Section, it can transport 13.5 tons of water per day, which is equivalent to the labor of nine and a half people. In addition to automatically delivering water to slopes, the "Water-powered Automatic Winch" can also transport construction materials such as stones and wood. However, two fixed steel wire ropes (or thick hemp ropes or lead wire ropes if steel wire ropes are not available) should be erected next to the pulling rope. The equipment is suspended from the steel wire rope with an open pulley and connected to the circulating hemp rope, so that the materials can be sent up as the water wheel rotates and the rope rises.
    This setup may seem complex, but it is actually quite simple to implement. In areas near rivers, a vertical waterwheel can be made based on the principle of water milling, and then a thick hemp rope can be added. The cost is not high, but the effectiveness is great.

    水利自动绞车
    （见右图）
    住在川道河流地区的农业社，用什么办法能把水送上二十至一百公尺高、二百公尺远的山坡上？使用铁道部第六工程局四工段创制的“水力自动绞车”就是办法之一。它是利用天然河水的冲力打动木制水轮，经过三道小木轮带动拉绳，将水桶拴在拉绳上，把水送上高处，而且能完全做到自装、自运、自卸，不用人管。根据四工段十六工区二十三小队试验，每天可运水十三吨半，相当于九个半人的劳动。“水力自动绞车”除了向山坡自动送水外，还可把石头、木材等基建材料送上去。不过要在拉绳旁边另外架设两条固定纲丝绳（无钢丝绳可用粗麻绳或铅丝拧成的铅丝绳），把器材用开口滑车吊在钢丝绳上，与循环麻绳连结起来，就可随着水轮转动、拉绳上升把材料送上去。
    这种设置看起来很复杂，但真正做起来却很简单。靠近河流地区大都可照水打磨原理做一立式水轮，然后架上粗麻绳就行，成本不高，效用很大。　（陕西日报）（附图片）
