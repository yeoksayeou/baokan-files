    The Recent Situation of the Wenlan Pavilion Siku Quanshu

    In the January 31st supplement, there was an article "The Fate of the Siku Quanshu," which mentioned the Siku Quanshu of the Wenlan Pavilion, saying: "In 1925, this book was largely completed and preserved by the former Zhejiang Library. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, this book was moved to Qingmuguan, Chongqing. Its current situation is unknown."

    In fact, its current situation is very good, it's just that the vast number of readers who care about it don't know. Here, I will report its whereabouts:

    During the Anti-Japanese War, this book was first moved to the countryside of Fuyang. After Hangzhou fell, it was moved to Longquan, and soon moved to Guiyang, and in 1944 it was moved to Qingmuguan, Chongqing. After the victory, it was moved back to Hangzhou.

    The Zhejiang Library now treasures it in the Qingbaishan Residence Building to the right of the main library (the building, including the Gujin Tushu Jicheng, has a total of one hundred and ten large bookcases), and it is sunned once every summer during the dog days, and camphor and other items are placed. In the years since liberation, more than one hundred volumes of the original manuscript from the Qianlong period have been successively recovered.

    This book is the only remaining one in the Southeast! Not only does the country cherish and value it very much, but people who come from afar, knowing about it, will definitely come to the Zhejiang Library to admire and read it. Many international friends who come to Hangzhou also come to Gushan to visit this world-renowned encyclopedia.

    文澜阁四库全书的近况
    1月31日副刊上有篇文章“四库全书的命运”，谈到文澜阁的四库全书说：“1925年，这部书大体上补全了，由前浙江图书馆保存。抗日战争爆发后，这部书被迁移到重庆青木关。近况未详。”
    其实，它的近况很好，只是关心它的广大读者们不知道而已。这里，我来报告它的下落：
    抗日战争时期，这部书先是搬到富阳乡下，杭州沦陷，搬龙泉，不久又搬贵阳，1944年搬到重庆青木关。胜利后方搬回杭州。
    浙江图书馆现在将它珍藏在总馆右边的青白山居大楼上（楼上连古今图书集成在内，共一百一十个大书橱），在每年夏季三伏天晒一次，并安放樟脑等物。解放后这几年来，乾隆时的原钞本，又陆续收回了一百多册。
    这部书是东南硕果仅存的一部了！不仅国内对它非常爱护、重视，从远道来的人们，知道它的，必然要到浙江图书馆来瞻仰、阅览。国际友人到了杭州，来孤山参观这部闻名全世界的大百科全书的也很多。
