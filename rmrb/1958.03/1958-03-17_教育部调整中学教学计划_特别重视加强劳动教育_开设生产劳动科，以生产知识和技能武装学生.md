Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: In order to further implement the educational policy and facilitate the gradual implementation of a work-study education system, the Ministry of Education has made necessary adjustments to the current middle school teaching plans. At the same time, it requires the education departments and bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities to make appropriate changes to the middle school teaching plans according to local industrial and agricultural production and the specific conditions of different types of schools, adapting to local conditions.

The 1958-1959 academic year middle school teaching plan and explanation formulated by the Ministry of Education particularly emphasizes strengthening labor education. The teaching plan and explanation stipulate that rural middle schools can sign contracts with local agricultural production cooperatives to organize students to participate in agricultural production. Schools with land can also set up experimental gardens. Urban middle schools can sign contracts with nearby factories, workshops, construction sites, or service industries to organize students to participate in production labor. Schools with the conditions can set up experimental factories. Schools with land can set up experimental gardens. Schools without land but near suburbs can organize students to participate in production labor in nearby agricultural production cooperatives. All rural students and urban students who have homes in the countryside should use vacations, holidays, or spare time to return to their villages to participate in production labor. The time spent participating in physical labor during the semester is a total of fourteen to twenty-eight days for both semesters (the originally stipulated busy farming leave is cancelled), mainly participating in production labor, and other on-campus and off-campus public welfare labor can also be included.

On the principle of ensuring the completion of the teaching plan, the vacation time and duration for winter and summer vacations shall be determined by the education departments and bureaus of each province, autonomous region, and directly administered municipality.

The teaching plan stipulates that, starting from this academic year, a production labor department will be established in each grade of junior and senior high school, with two hours of teaching time per week (the original name of the internship department is cancelled).

The establishment of a production labor department is to arm students with basic knowledge and preliminary skills of industrial and agricultural production, cultivate students' correct labor viewpoints and good labor habits, enable the cultural and scientific knowledge learned to be applied to practice, promote the all-round development of intelligence and physical strength, and prepare better conditions for participating in production labor. The production labor department includes manual labor and basic agricultural knowledge in junior high school, and agricultural and mechanical internships in senior high school.

The teaching plan also made adjustments to the improvement and strengthening of foreign language teaching in middle schools, as well as the arrangement and teaching time for some subjects such as Chinese, history, and geography.

    教育部调整中学教学计划
    特别重视加强劳动教育
    开设生产劳动科，以生产知识和技能武装学生
    据新华社15日讯　为了进一步贯彻教育方针，利于逐步实行勤工俭学、半工半读的教育制度，教育部对现行中学教学计划作了必要的调整。同时要求各省、自治区、直辖市教育厅、局，根据当地工农业生产和不同类型学校的具体情况，因地制宜地对中学教学计划作适当的变动。
    教育部制定的1958—1959学年度中学教学计划和说明中，特别重视加强劳动教育。教学计划和说明中规定，农村中学可以同当地农业生产合作社订立合同，组织学生参加农业生产。有土地的学校，还可以设置实验园地。城市中学可以同附近工厂、作坊、工地或服务性行业订立合同，组织学生参加生产劳动。有条件的学校可以设立实验工厂。有土地的学校可以设置实验园地，没有土地而邻近郊区的学校，可以组织学生到附近农业生产合作社参加生产劳动。凡农村学生和在农村有家的城市学生，都应该利用假期，假日或课余时间回到本村参加生产劳动。在学期中参加体力劳动的时间，两个学期一共为十四天到二十八天（原规定的农忙假取消），主要是参加生产劳动，其余校内外公益劳动，也可以计算在内。
    在保证完成教学计划的原则下，寒暑假放假时间和期限由各省、自治区、直辖市教育厅、局自行决定。
    教学计划规定，从本学年度起，初、高中各年级都开设生产劳动科，教学时数每周二小时（原实习科的名称取消）。
    开设生产劳动科是以工、农业生产的基础知识和初步技能去武装学生，培养学生正确的劳动观点和良好的劳动习惯，使所学文化科学知识能够运用于实践，促进智力和体力的全面发展，并为参加生产劳动准备更好的条件。生产劳动科包括初中手工劳动和农业基础知识，高中农业实习和机械实习。
    教学计划对于改进和加强中学外国语科的教学，以及对语文、历史、地理等部分学科的安排和教学时数，也作了调整。
