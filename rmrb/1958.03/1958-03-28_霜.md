Frost

　　The lines "The moon sets, crows cry, frost fills the sky" and "The rustling frost flies, the army marches out at night" give people the impression that frost is like a vast fog or swirling snow, flying all over the sky. In reality, "frost flying" is merely the imagination of poets and cannot be scientifically verified.

　　Frost is a type of white ice crystal that appears on the ground during clear nights. It does not fall from the sky. Instead, it forms because the temperature drops, greatly reducing the air's ability to hold water vapor, and the excess water vapor freezes. During spring and autumn nights, when the temperature of the ground or near-ground objects drops below 0 degrees Celsius due to heat radiation or the intrusion of cold air, the water vapor in the lower air layers and the moisture evaporating from plant branches, leaves, and soil condenses and freezes into white ice crystals, attaching to the ground or near-ground objects. This is frost. Therefore, frost does not "fly" at all, let alone "fill the sky."

　　Due to different causes of temperature reduction, frost can be divided into three types: The first type is "advection frost." This is formed when a cold wave from the north invades the south, causing a sudden drop in temperature. Because cold waves are large in scale and wide in scope, the area affected by frost damage is often very large. The second type is "radiation frost." It is formed when the ground or near-ground objects radiate a large amount of heat, cooling the near-ground air, and water vapor freezes into frost. This type of frost is localized. The third type is "advection-radiation frost," which is the most common and widespread type. Often, when a cold wave arrives, the temperature does not drop below the frost point, and frost only forms after nighttime radiation cooling.

　　Frost often harms plants. Once flowers, grass, and trees are touched by frost, they gradually wither and die; if crops are struck by frost, their yields will also decrease. However, this disaster is not caused by the frost itself, but by the fact that the water inside the plant freezes into ice at very low temperatures, making it impossible for the plant to grow and causing it to die.

　　The following are some of the more effective frost prevention methods that have been tried in various parts of China:

　　Wrapping and covering method: For some smaller but valuable plants and fruit trees, they can be wrapped with waste paper, rice straw, wheat straw, or reeds. Vegetables and other crops growing on the ground that cannot be wrapped can be covered with sorghum stalks, reeds, or mats to prevent the temperature from dropping.

　　Irrigation method: Watering and irrigating before frost can increase the moisture in the soil. Because water can absorb heat radiated from the ground and slowly release the heat it contains when there is a lack of heat in the air. At the same time, wet soil conducts heat much more slowly than dry soil, so it can prevent the ground from cooling down suddenly before frost and prevent it from heating up immediately after frost.

　　Smudging method: In larger areas, accumulate some combustible but smoky materials (such as tree branches, weeds, chaff, dry cow and horse manure, etc.) before frost, and burn them to produce smoke, the denser the smoke, the better. This is because the dense smoke fills the air, which can absorb the heat radiated from the ground and can also act as condensation nuclei for water vapor to condense on and turn into fog. This can not only prevent the ground from radiating heat, but also release some latent heat when the water vapor condenses, supplying it to the ground. At the same time, the carbon dioxide released in the dense smoke can also absorb the heat radiated from the ground. In addition, the burning smoke piles will also release some heat. All of these can prevent the temperature of the near-ground air from decreasing.

　　In terms of cultivation, deep plowing to loosen the soil and applying more fertilizer can change the properties of the soil and enhance its frost resistance. Dense planting of wheat can also prevent heat dissipation due to the vigorous growth of seedlings, and changing the sowing time of crops can also prevent frost. For long-term benefits, we should also learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and plant frost prevention forests or build frost prevention embankments, which are effective large-scale frost prevention measures.

    霜
    春阳
    “月落乌啼霜满天”和“飒飒飞霜夜出师”这些诗句，让人们感到霜有如茫茫大雾，飘飘白雪一样地满天飞舞，其实“霜飞”只是诗人们的遐想，在科学上是追究不得的。
    霜是在晴朗的夜里地面上出现的一种白色冰晶。它不是从天上降下来的，而是因为气温降低，空气里容纳水蒸气的能力大大减少，多余的水蒸气凝冻而成。春秋的夜晚，当地面或近地面的物体因本身散热或冷空气的侵入而使温度降低到摄氏零度以下时，低处空气层里的水蒸气和草木枝叶及泥土中跑出来的水分，就凝集冻结成白色的冰晶物，附在地面或近地面的物体上，这就是霜。所以霜根本不会“飞”，更谈不到“满天”了。
    由于气温降低的原因不同，霜又可分三种：第一种是“平流霜”。这是由于北方寒潮向南方侵袭时，气温突然降低而生成的。由于寒潮的规模大，范围广，霜害的面积往往也是很大的。第二种是“辐射霜”。它是因地面或近地面的物体大量散热，而使近地面的空气冷却，水蒸气冻结而成霜。这种霜是局部性的。第三种是“平流辐射霜”。也是最常见最普遍的一种霜。往往在寒潮侵来时，气温并不降至霜点以下，而经过夜间辐射冷却，才成为霜。
    霜往往能伤害植物。花草树木经霜一沾，就逐渐枯死；农作物经霜一打，也会减产。但是，这种灾害并不是由霜本身所造成，而是在温度很低的情况下，植物体内的水分，也要冻结成冰，就使植物无法生长而死亡。
    我国各地曾经试用过的比较有效的防霜方法有以下几种：
    包扎和遮盖法：对于一些范围较小的但又十分贵重的植物和果树，可以用废纸、稻草、麦秸、芦苇把它们分别包扎起来。在地面生长的蔬菜等作物，无法包扎时可用秫秆、芦苇或席子将其遮盖起来，防止气温降低。
    灌溉法：在霜前进行浇水灌溉，增加土壤中的水分。因为水分既可以吸取地面散射的热量，又能在空气中热量缺乏的时候慢慢地放出自己所容纳的热。同时，湿土传热比干土要慢得多，所以霜前可以防止地面的骤然冷却，霜后又可以防止立刻变热。
    熏烟法：在面积较广大的地区，霜前用一些可燃而又能冒烟的东西（如树枝、杂草、糠皮、牛马的干粪等）堆积起来，燃烧生烟，烟愈浓愈好。这是因为浓烟弥漫空中，可以吸收地面散射出去的热量，又能作为凝结核让水蒸气凝结在上面变成雾。这样不但可以阻止地面散热，而且水蒸气在凝结时又能放出一些潜热，供给地面。同时浓烟中放出的二氧化碳，也可以吸收地面放出的热量。再加上燃烧的烟堆，也会放出一些热量。所有这些，都可以防止近地面空气温度的下降。
    在耕作上，深耕疏松土壤和多施肥，都可以改变土壤的性状增强防霜力。小麦密植也因苗旺盛可以阻止散热，以及改变作物的播种时间，都能防霜。为了长远利益，我们还应该学习苏联先进经验，种植防霜林或建立防霜堤，这才是大规模防霜的有效办法。
