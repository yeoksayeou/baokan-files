    Putonghua and Dialects
    Liu Feng
    The promotion of Putonghua is a measure that most people can accept, because as fellow countrymen, how can we not have a common language? Now I want to talk about the other side, which is that people who can speak Putonghua should also learn some dialects. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report "The Tasks of the Current Reform of the Chinese Written Language": people who can speak Putonghua should learn some local dialects in order to go deep into the working masses in various dialect areas.
    As the saying goes, "The most valuable thing in knowing people is knowing their hearts." To know their hearts, you have to talk to them. Language is the voice of the heart. If the language is not understood, the heart naturally cannot be talked about, and knowing the heart is even more impossible. However, talking heart to heart and knowing hearts are not our only goals. The more important reason for us to learn the language of the masses is to better go from the masses to the masses. If the language of the masses cannot be understood or spoken, then it will be hindered by language: you cannot come from the masses; you cannot go to the masses. Moreover, the language of the masses is vivid, expressive, and rich in vocabulary, which can cure our poor and dry "student-like" shortcomings!
    Now, tens of thousands of intellectuals and cadres are going to the countryside and up to the mountains, going deep into every corner of the country, which has created a favorable condition for the promotion of Putonghua. However, sending people down also gives intellectuals and cadres more opportunities to get close to the working masses, and also forces everyone to learn the local language. Chairman Mao once said in his article "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing": "We are a revolutionary party, we serve the masses. If we do not learn the language of the masses, we will not be able to do a good job."
    Now, the cadres who are sent down can all strive to eat, live, and labor with the peasants, and are determined to learn from the working peasants. However, there are also a very few cadres who are sent down who hold a purely labor-oriented view, and also have the idea of being a guest without making long-term plans, and are unwilling to actively learn the language of the local masses. In this way, contact with the masses becomes optional, and in this way, the Party's policy of going from the masses to the masses cannot be implemented, which naturally affects their own training and transformation.
    When cadres who are sent down are teaching peasants to read, learn culture, and tutoring rural youth, they have the task of promoting Putonghua; but at the same time, learning the language of the local masses is also a required course. If you chat with old peasants and peasant women who have not yet learned Putonghua without using the local language, then it will inevitably be a bit "bureaucratic" and will create a distance from the masses.
    Perhaps some people think that the language of the masses is difficult to learn, but it is not so. Because people always have to talk. Since we have contacted the masses, and the masses have contacted us, and we are together every day eating, living, and working together, it is very natural for us to learn from each other and influence each other in language. Saying that the local language of the masses is difficult to learn only applies to people who do not contact the masses at all.

    普通话和地方话
    刘丰
    推广普通话，这一措施，大多数人都能接受，因为同为本国人，岂可没有共同的语言。现在我要说说另一面，这就是会普通话的人，也应学点方言。正如周总理在“当前文字改革的任务”报告中所指出的：会说普通话的人，要学点各地方言，才能深入各个方言区的劳动群众。
    语云“人之相知贵相知心”，要相知心，就得谈心。言为心声，语言不通，心，自然谈不出来，知心更无从说起了。然而，谈心和知心，还不是我们的目的，我们学习群众语言更重要的是便于更好地从群众中来到群众中去。群众语言如听不懂讲不来，那就为语言所阻：从群众中来也来不了；到群众中去也去不成。何况群众语言生动、形象，语汇丰富，它可以医治我们贫乏、干巴巴的“学生腔”的毛病呢！
    现在成千上万的知识分子干部正在下乡上山，深入到全国各个角落，这为推广普通话创造了一个有利的条件。然而下放也给知识分子干部以更多接近劳动群众的机会，也逼着大家非学习当地语言不可。毛主席在“反对党八股”一文中曾经说过：“我们是革命党，是为群众办事的，如果也不学群众的语言，那就办不好。”
    现在下放的干部都能努力做到和农民同吃同住同劳动，都有决心向劳动农民学习，可是也有极少数的下放干部，存在着单纯劳动的观点，还有不作长远打算的作客思想，不愿积极地学习本地群众的语言。这样接触群众就成为可有可无，这样也就贯彻不了党的从群众中来到群众中去的方针，这自然也影响了自己的锻炼和改造。
    下放干部在教农民认字、学文化，为农村青年补习时，是有推广普通话的任务的；但同时学本地群众语言也是一门必修科。如果同还没有学会普通话的老农、农妇话家常，不用地方话，那就不免有点“打官腔”就会造成同群众的距离。
    也许有人认为群众语言难学，其实并不如此，因为人总是要说话的，我们既接触了群众，群众也接触了我们，又是天天在一起同吃、同住、同劳动，在语言上彼此相互学习、相互影响，是很自然的。说地方群众语言难学，那只是对根本不接触群众的人才适用的。
