    Strive to Become a "Four-Without" Country Early
    National Campaign to Eliminate Four Pests and Eradicate Diseases Competition Conference Opens

    (Reported by this newspaper) The national competition conference on eliminating the four pests and eradicating diseases, jointly convened by the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Ministry of Health, opened in Beijing on the 14th. Eighty representatives from twenty-six provinces (regions) and cities, and thirty-eight medical colleges attended the meeting.

    Minister of Health Li Dequan, Vice Ministers Xu Yunbei, and Qian Xinzhong spoke at the meeting successively. They requested the representatives to go all out amidst the upsurge of the "Double-Anti" campaign, launch a friendly competition to eliminate the four pests, eradicate diseases, and promote a great leap forward in the entire health work, so as to guarantee a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. They pointed out that since the launch of the nationwide patriotic health campaign last winter, great achievements have been made in eliminating the four pests and eradicating diseases. We must strive to transform our country into a "Four-Without" country ahead of schedule, and eradicate all kinds of diseases that are most harmful to the people, which requires us to further overcome conservative thinking, more fully arouse the enthusiasm of the masses, cultivate more medical and health workers who are both red and expert, and give full play to their roles. They also pointed out that it is necessary to run hospitals diligently and thriftily, break with conventions, improve management, and improve the quality of medical care. The research work of medical science should be coordinated with the current mass health campaign, and should be oriented towards the countryside, vigorously helping the masses to summarize and promote the experience of eliminating the four pests and eradicating various diseases.

    During the conference, the Ministry of Health specially opened a "Democracy Forum," allowing the representatives to post big-character posters, fully express their opinions, and conduct debates. The representatives were asked to ignite a raging fire against waste and conservatism, burn away the "five airs" in the leadership of the Ministry of Health, exchange experiences among the representatives, and carry out competition. The conference is expected to last for four days.

    争取提早成为“四无”国
    全国除四害、消灭疾病竞赛会议开幕
    本报讯　中央爱国卫生运动委员会、卫生部联合召开的全国除四害、消灭疾病的竞赛会议，14日在北京开幕。到会的包括二十六个省（区）市和三十八个医学院校的代表八十人。
    卫生部部长李德全、副部长徐运北、钱信忠先后在会上讲话。他们要求到会的代表在“双反”的热潮中，鼓足干劲，开展除四害、消灭疾病和促进整个卫生工作大跃进的友谊竞赛，以保证工农业生产的大跃进。他们指出：自去年冬季展开全民规模的爱国卫生运动以来，除四害和消灭疾病的工作，已取得很大成就。我们要力争提前把我国变成“四无”国，以及消灭危害人民最严重的各种疾病，这就需要进一步地克服保守思想，更充分地鼓起广大群众的干劲，更多地培养又红又专的医药卫生工作者，并充分发挥他们的作用。他们还指出：必须勤俭办医院，打破陈规，改进管理，提高医疗质量。医学科学的研究工作应该与当前群众性的卫生运动相配合，并要面向农村，大力帮助群众总结、推广除四害和消灭各种疾病的经验。
    会议期间，卫生部特开辟鸣放园地，让到会的代表张贴大字报，大鸣大放，大辩论。要求到会代表燃起一把反浪费反保守的烈火，烧掉卫生部领导上的五气，在代表之间交流经验，开展竞赛。会议预计开四天。
