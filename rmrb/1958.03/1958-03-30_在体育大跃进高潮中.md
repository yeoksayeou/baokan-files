    In the Upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in Sports

    Shanghai to Hold Sports Activity Week

    Shanghai has decided to hold a "National Sports Activity Week" from March 31st to April 6th. During the activity week, the Sports Commission, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Education Bureau will vigorously mobilize and organize the people of the city to participate in sports activities, striving for each person to participate in at least ten minutes of sports activities every day. Starting from the activity week, the goal is to have four million people in Shanghai regularly participating in sports activities.

    This "National Sports Activity Week" is one of a series of active measures taken by the sports community and related departments in Shanghai to strive for the early realization of the "Ten-Year Development Program for Sports Movement" recently proposed by the National Sports Commission, and to respond to Vice Premier Chen Yi's call for a "nuclear explosion" in sports movement.

    Wuhan Strives for 70% of Citizens to Participate in Exercise

    More than 20,000 sports activists from factories, schools, troops, and suburban agricultural producers' cooperatives in Wuhan held a city-wide conference of sports activists on March 23rd.

    Sun Yaohua, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan and Director of the Wuhan Sports Commission, read out Wuhan's Great Leap Forward plan for sports movement at the meeting: In about ten years, Wuhan will strive for 70% of the population to participate in sports activities; 600,000 to 800,000 people will pass the Labor and Defense System; 120,000 people will reach the level of graded athletes; and 160 to 200 sports masters will emerge. During this period, some major projects will catch up with the world's advanced level.

    Benxi Takes the Lead in the Sports Leap Forward

    More than 1,400 sports workers and athletes in Benxi City held a Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally for sports on March 12th. In the sports leap forward in Liaoning Province, Benxi's move is considered the first shot.

    In order to rapidly leap forward in sports movement in Benxi City, the oath-taking rally put forward a specific action plan. The plan requires that within two years, 200,000 people regularly participate in sports exercises, reaching 60% of the urban population, and in terms of sports level, they should catch up with the provincial level and approach the national level within two years.

    Xi'an Stadium to Improve Utilization Rate

    Employees of the Xi'an People's Stadium in Shaanxi Province are determined to go all out and strive for a Great Leap Forward in their work. They plan to better serve the masses this year and achieve self-sufficiency.

    The Xi'an People's Stadium is the only mass sports activity venue in Xi'an, with an area of more than 100,000 square meters and complete facilities, but the utilization rate is not high. The stadium's expenses, equipment purchases, and site maintenance are also dependent on the state, with an annual expenditure of more than 20,000 yuan. In order to better serve the masses and reduce state spending, the stadium has formulated some measures to facilitate mass activities and organize competitions more and better, so as to develop future work. At the same time, all employees are using their brains to tap potential, make careful calculations, and adopt methods of increasing income and reducing expenditure, determined to achieve self-sufficiency. In order to ensure self-sufficiency, the stadium has also formulated specific measures regarding improving the utilization rate of venues and equipment, opposing waste, practicing strict economy, and implementing a cost accounting system.

    Hunan Launches Sports Exercise Competition

    In order to promote a Great Leap Forward in sports movement, the Hunan Provincial Sports Commission recently issued a notice, calling on all parts of Hunan to launch a province-wide spring sports exercise competition upsurge on the basis of the original winter sports exercises.

    The notice requires sports commissions and other departments in various cities and counties to establish spring sports exercise competition evaluation committees, and grassroots units to also establish evaluation groups to specifically lead and organize the competition work.

    The exercise competition projects include: mountain climbing, cross-country, high jump, long jump, etc. (Attached picture)

    在体育大跃进高潮中
    上海将举行体育活动周
    上海市决定自3月31日起到4月6日举行一个“全民体育活动周”。在活动周内，体委、工会、青年团和教育局等单位将大力发动和组织全市人民参加体育活动，争取每人每天至少参加十分钟体育活动。从活动周开始，力争全上海市有四百万人经常参加体育活动。
    这次举行“全民体育活动周”是上海市体育界及有关方面，为争取早日实现最近国家体委提出的“体育运动十年发展纲要”，并响应陈毅副总理提出的体育运动也来个“原子爆炸”的号召，而采取的一系列的积极措施之一。
    武汉争取70％市民参加锻炼
    武汉市各工厂、学校、部队和郊区农业生产合作社的二万多体育积极分子3月23日举行了全市体育活动分子大会。
    武汉市副市长、武汉市体委主任孙耀华在会上宣读了武汉市体育运动的跃进规划：武汉市在十年左右，争取有70％的人口参加体育活动；有六十万至八十万人通过劳卫制；十二万人达到等级运动员标准；出现运动健将一百六十人至二百人。在这个时期内有一些主要项目赶上世界先进水平。
    本溪在体育跃进中带了头
    本溪市一千四百多个体育工作者和运动员在3月12日举行了体育大跃进誓师大会。在辽宁省的体育跃进中，本溪这次算是第一炮。
    为了使本溪市的体育运动迅速跃进，誓师大会提出了具体的行动计划。计划要求在两年内，有二十万人经常参加体育锻炼，达到市区人数的60％，体育运动水平方面，要在两年内赶上省级水平，接近国家水平。
    西安体育场要提高利用率
    陕西西安市人民体育场职工决心鼓足干劲，力争在工作上来个大跃进。他们计划在今年内要更好地为群众服务，并做到自给自足。
    西安人民体育场是西安市唯一的群众体育活动场地，面积有十多万平方公尺，设备齐全，不过利用率不高。体育场的经费、器材购置和场地养护等也都赖国家维持，每年要国家开支两万多元。为了使体育场更好地为群众服务和使国家少花钱，这次该场制订了一些便利群众活动和更多更好地组织竞赛的办法，来开展今后工作。同时，全场职工开动脑筋，挖掘潜力，精打细算，采取开源节流的办法，决心要做到自给自足。为了保证做到自给自足，该场还拟定了关于提高场地和器材的使用率，反浪费，厉行节约，实行成本核算制度等具体措施。
    湖南开展体育锻炼竞赛
    为了促使体育运动的大跃进，湖南省体育运动委员会最近发出通知，号召湖南各地，在原有冬季体育锻炼的基础上，掀起一个全省性的春季体育锻炼竞赛高潮。
    通知中要求各市县体委等部门成立春季体育锻炼竞赛评比委员会，各基层单位也成立评比小组，来具体地领导和组织竞赛工作。
    锻炼竞赛的项目有：爬山、越野、跳高、跳远等。（附图片）
