    Lantern Festival Talk

    “Fire trees and silver flowers meet, star bridge and iron locks open. Dim dust follows the horses, bright moon chases the people. The riders are all lush plums, the songs all falling plum blossoms. The golden crows are not forbidden at night, the jade clepsydra does not urge the time.” This is a Tang poem describing the lantern scenery of the Lantern Festival night.
    The Lantern Festival on the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, also known as the Shangyuan Festival. Since the Tang Dynasty in China, on this festival night, people have been decorating with lanterns and colored banners and singing and dancing.
    In Chinese history, the Tang Dynasty's economy, politics, and culture reached their peak. With abundant harvests and social prosperity, the people demanded higher cultural and artistic lives. The rulers also wanted to take this opportunity to praise the peace of the country, taking advantage of the time before the start of agricultural work in the first month to celebrate national peace and security with the joy of lighting lanterns. The lantern viewing period initially lasted one night, later developing into three or four nights.
    The custom of lighting lanterns greatly advanced lantern-making technology. At that time, in addition to large-scale lantern trees and lantern towers, there were also creatively designed and ingeniously crafted flower lanterns of various flowers, birds, and animals such as egrets holding flowers, yellow dragons spitting water, and golden phoenixes and silver swallows.
    Although watching lanterns was a popular recreational activity for the masses, it also showed the people's desire for light. However, as it developed later, the rulers disregarded the suffering of the people and instead took the opportunity to pursue extravagance and pleasure to their heart's content. There is a story: A state official during the Lantern Festival forced each household to light seven lanterns. Seven lanterns could not but be a heavy burden for the "common people." In order to protest this, one family specially made a large lantern more than a zhang long, on which was written a poem: "A rich family's lantern is a grain of millet in the granary, a poor family's lantern makes father and son cry to each other, does the romantic governor know, and still hates that the songs and dances are not wonderful."
    Today, the Lantern Festival has come again in our era of the Great Leap Forward. Welcoming it are the myriad lights on the water conservancy construction sites, the leaping songs of the people who know nothing of day and night. Let us dance with joy and bless our descendants to enjoy eternal peace!

    元宵灯话
    左宦
    “火树银花合，星桥铁锁开。暗尘随马去，明月逐人来。游骑皆穠李，行歌尽落梅。金吾不禁夜，玉漏莫相催。”这是唐人描写元宵夜灯景的诗句。
    夏历正月十五元宵日，又称上元节。我国自唐代以来，每逢这个节日之夜，人们都张灯结彩、载歌载舞。
    在中国历史上，唐代的经济和政治、文化的发展都盛极一时。年岁丰稔、社会繁荣，人民都要求文化艺术生活的提高，统治者也想借此歌颂四海升平，趁此正月农作业开始之前，以燃灯之乐来庆祝国泰平安。玩灯的日期，最初是一夜，后来又发展为三、四夜。
    燃灯的习俗，使制灯技术大大发展。当时除有大型的灯树、灯楼外，还有白鹭持花、黄龙吐水、金凫银燕等别出心裁、巧夺天工的各种花卉和鸟兽的花灯。
    观灯虽是人民群众所爱好的文娱活动，也显示了人民向往光明的意愿。但是发展到后来，统治者却置民间疾苦而不顾，反借此尽情追求奢侈淫乐。有这么一个故事：有一个州官在元宵节时强令每户燃灯七盏。七盏灯，对于“升斗小民”来说，不能不是一件沉重的负担。群众为了对此抗议，有一家特别制了一个一丈多长的大灯，灯上写着一首诗：“富家一盏灯，太仓一粒粟，贫家一盏灯，父子相对哭，风流太守知不知，犹恨笙歌无妙曲。”
    今天，元宵节在我们大跃进的时代又来到了。迎接它的，是那水利工地上的万盏灯火，是那不知道什么是白天与黑夜的人们的跃进歌声，让我们欢欣起舞，为子孙万代永享太平而祝福吧！
