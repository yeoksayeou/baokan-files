The Function of Human Hair

The surface of human skin, with the exception of the palms, soles, flexor surfaces and sides of fingers and toes, lips, and sexual organs, is covered with three types of hair: long hair, coarse hair, and vellus hair. Head hair, beard, whiskers, axillary hair, and pubic hair are long hair; eyebrows, eyelashes, nasal hair, and hair in the external auditory canal are coarse hair; vellus hair, commonly known as body hair, covers the trunk, limbs, and other areas.

Hair can adorn a person's appearance, but more importantly, it protects the head from external harm. When the head is hit or struck by a blunt object, the elasticity and toughness of the hair can reduce the impact and force of the blow. In winter, hair also protects against wind and keeps the scalp warm. Outside the human body, hair has many uses: long hair can be used for makeup and export. Short hair can be made into "sulfanilamide" injections for Western medicine; it is also used as a "blood residue" tonic in Chinese medicine; it can also be used as fertilizer; it can also be spun into pockets that sell well abroad; it can also be made into felt for civil and transportation industries, providing warmth in winter and insulation in summer; it can also be used to extract protein components to make foam, which has fire-extinguishing properties and is a raw material needed by the fire-fighting industry; it can also be mixed with mud to line stoves, plaster pot stands, and build stoves.

The beard and whiskers do not have much function; they seem only to differentiate between men and women and indicate age.

Eyebrows can block dust from entering the eyes. Eyelashes do the same, and can also prevent foreign objects and small insects from entering the eyes, as well as reduce the stimulation of strong light. When the upper eyelid droops, because the eyelashes of the upper eyelid are longer, they can cover the pupil, like a bamboo curtain, which does not prevent us from seeing things, but also avoids direct light.

Nasal hair is like a fence, blocking dust, bacteria, and small insects in the air from entering the nasal cavity. The hair in the external auditory canal has the same function.

Axillary hair and pubic hair can reduce friction between two directly contacting skin surfaces, preventing injury.

Body hair is something that has degenerated in the process of human evolution and does not have much function. However, the sweat pores at the exit of the body hair can discharge sweat and sebum, regulate body temperature, and have a respiratory function.

In addition to the above functions, hair is also closely related to human emotions and the sensation of cold. For example, a person often gets goosebumps when frightened, becomes furious when angry, and gets goosebumps when cold. This is a phenomenon of nerve reflex. Near the root of the hair there is a nerve device - tactile corpuscles, so there is a feeling of "moving a hair and alarming the whole body."

Ancient literature (such as "Longevity and Elderly Care" and other books) believes that not having white hair or baldness when old, but having particularly long eyebrows, nasal hair, and hair in the external auditory canal, is a sign of longevity. Although the literature does not explain the reason, we can speculate that the organ tissues of the elderly should show signs of decline, but they are the opposite, which shows that their vitality is strong, because hair is closely related to human metabolism.

### 人体毛发的作用

    人体毛发的作用
    人的皮肤表面上，除掌、踱、指、趾的屈侧和侧面、口唇及性器官外，分布着长毛、硬毛和毳毛三种毛。头发、胡须、髯、腋毛和阴毛是长毛；眉毛、眼毛、鼻毛和外耳道的毛是硬毛；毳毛就是我们常说的汗毛，布满在躯干、四肢等处。
    头发，能装饰人的容貌，但更重要的作用是保护头部不受外界的伤害。当头顶被撞或被钝器击打时，由于头发的弹力和韧性关系，会使撞力和打击力量减轻。在冬天，头发还有挡风和保暖头皮的作用。头发在人体以外，还有很多用途：长发可以作化装用具和出口。短发可以制成西药用的“磺氨酸”注射剂；又是中药用的“血余”补药；还可作肥料；还可纺织制成畅销国外的口袋；还能制成民用和交通运输业用的毛毡，冬季防寒，夏季防热；还可提炼出蛋白质成分来制成泡沫，有灭火功能，是消防工业需要的原料；还可掺泥土用来套炉子、抹锅台、盘炉灶等。
    胡须和髯的作用不大，似乎只是区别男女和标志年纪大小的作用。
    眉毛可以挡住尘埃落入眼内。睫毛也如此，并且还能抵挡异物小虫侵入眼内，以及减少强烈光线的刺激。当上眼皮下垂时，因为上眼皮的睫毛较长，可以遮住瞳孔，好像一个竹帘子一样，既不防碍我们看东西，又可以避免光线的直射。
    鼻毛好像篱笆一样，挡住空气中的尘埃、细菌、小虫，不使它们进入鼻腔。外耳道毛的作用也相同。
    腋毛和阴毛可以使二个直接接触的皮肤面减少磨擦，避免发生损伤。
    汗毛是人类进化过程中已经退化的东西，没有什么大作用。可是，汗毛的出口汗孔，可以将汗及皮脂排出，调节体温，并有呼吸作用。
    毛除了上述作用外，和人的情绪、寒冷感也有密切关系。例如一个人受惊时常会毛骨悚然，生气时会怒发冲冠，寒冷时会起鸡皮疙瘩等等。这是一种神经反射的现象。毛的根部附近有神经装置——触觉小体，所以会有“牵一毫而惊动全身”的感觉。
    古代文献（如寿亲养老等书）中认为年老时头发不白、不秃顶，而眉毛、鼻毛和外耳道的毛特别长的，乃是长寿之相。文献上虽然没有说明道理，但是我们可以推想，老年人的机体组织应该呈现衰退现象，而他却相反，这说明他的生命力强，因为毛发和人的新陈代谢有很大的关系。　（玲）
