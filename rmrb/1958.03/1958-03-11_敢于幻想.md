    Daring to Imagine
    Fu Da
    Ears that hear from afar, eyes that see a thousand miles – these are bold fantasies. But humanity has the ability to make fantasies a reality, and the results may even exceed the original goals: even if the wind isn't right, one can still hear clearly; even if it's more than a thousand miles, one can still see. Flying through the clouds and mist is a fantasy, Yu Gong moving the mountain is a fantasy, Chang'e flying to the moon is a fantasy, a world of great harmony is a fantasy... But yesterday's fantasies become today's realities, and even tomorrow's bygone things, which is not something to be surprised about. Fantasies that cannot be realized today may become facts in the future. If humanity could not fantasize, perhaps we would still only be crawling on the ground today. Beautiful and bold fantasies, fantasies based on reality, fantasies that conform to the laws of historical development, and fantasies combined with labor, are achievable fantasies. They promote human progress and do not hinder it. Otherwise, they can only be called daydreams, dreams, or wild thoughts.
    "Reaching heaven in one step" may one day be possible, but at least for now, it's just a sarcastic remark. "A tower of ten thousand zhang rises from the ground" – with a solid foundation, accurate direction, bold fantasies, and down-to-earth efforts, a tower of ten thousand zhang can be built in people's hands. The people of Paoma Township in Dangyang County, Hubei Province, held a Zhuge Liang meeting, and a fantasy was born: to improve tools and eliminate carrying burdens on the shoulders. All of a sudden, everyone contributed ideas, everyone took action, every household was a factory, everyone was a carpenter, and the entire township became "wheeled" in three days. Boxes, cabinets, and tables were fitted with wheels and turned into carts. The original labor of carrying burdens on the shoulders became pushing carts, increasing efficiency several times over. From the township to the county, from this county to neighboring counties, and then promoted to the entire province. One township "running horses," the entire province galloping, and socialist construction making a great leap forward.
    Such a fantasy can bear fruit. If the people who participated in the Zhuge Liang meeting in Paoma Township had fantasized not about the existing boxes, cabinets, and tables, but about thousands of bulldozers, excavators, and cranes that were temporarily unavailable, it would still be useless, even though such a fantasy will come true in the future. But today, we must start from reality; if we are divorced from today's reality, we cannot talk about tomorrow's harvest. Of course, if a person lacks fantasy or ideals, thinks of nothing, and simply performs their duties like a monk striking the bell, then they will only stagnate and regress.
    Literature has mythology, romanticism, and even "ghost stories" of demons and monsters (such as "Liaozhai"), but apart from some dross that makes people passive, compromised, decadent, and otherworldly, there are also some positive elements. They can arouse people's resistance to the ugly reality and their pursuit of bright ideals. How full of glorious and noble fantasies is Qu Yuan's "Li Sao"! He drives a jade dragon and phoenix, surrounded by banners made of rainbows, and flies to a bright world where there are gods, beautiful women, exotic flowers, and rare herbs, and no room for treacherous villains. The poet's magnificent fantasies have inspired people for thousands of years, no matter how long the road, they still want to pursue and explore.
    Chairman Mao's Butterfly Love Flower poem, recently published, deeply moves people for this reason. Martyrs who sacrificed for the people's cause have flown to the moon palace, where Wu Gang invites them to drink, and Chang'e dances for them, and tears of mourning are transformed into sweet rain irrigating the earth. What a magnificent fantasy, what a broad mind! It awakens people's infinitely optimistic spirit towards history, reality, and the future.
    Comrade Zhou Yang said in his report that writers should "dare to fantasize." This is an inspiring call. Many great writers are also great fantasists. Of course, the fantasies in literature are not exactly the same as the fantasies or ideals in actual work. But the ability to fantasize is not limited to writers. Writers must fantasize, and non-writers must also fantasize. The working people are rich in fantasy, dare to fantasize, and are also brave enough to put it into practice. The farmers and cadres in Paoma Township and all over the country who are actively giving play to their creativity in the Great Leap Forward are such people.
    Let our fantasies fly healthily!

    敢于幻想
    傅达
    顺风耳，千里眼，这是大胆的幻想。但是人类有本事使幻想实现，甚至结果还会超过原来的指标：那怕风不顺，也能听得清；即使超过一千里，还是看得见。腾云驾雾是幻想，愚公移山是幻想，嫦娥奔月是幻想，世界大同是幻想……。但是昨天的幻想会变成今天的现实，甚至变成明日的黄花，丝毫也不值得大惊小怪。今天还不能实现的幻想，将来有可能成为事实。人类如果不能幻想，也许今天还只能在地上爬行。美丽大胆的幻想，从实际出发的幻想，符合历史发展规律的幻想，和劳动结合的幻想，是能够实现的幻想。它对人类进步起促进作用，不起促退作用。否则便只能说是空想、梦想、胡思乱想。
    “一步登天”，也许有那么一天能够实现，可是至少现在还不过是一句讽刺的话头。“万丈高楼平地起”，坚实的基础，准确的方向，大胆的幻想，加上踏踏实实的努力，那么万丈高楼是可以在人们手里建成的。湖北省当阳县跑马乡的人开了个诸葛亮会，一个幻想产生了：改良工具，消灭肩挑。一下子人人献计，个个动手，家家是工厂，人人当木匠，三天工夫全乡就“车子化”了。箱子、柜子、桌子，装上了轮子，变成了小车。原来肩挑的劳动变成了车推，效率提高了几倍。由乡而县，由本县而邻县，再推广到全省。一乡“跑马”，全省飞奔，社会主义建设大大跃进。
    这样的幻想是能够结果的花，如果跑马乡参加那个诸葛亮会的人所幻想的，不是现有的箱子、柜子、桌子，而是一时不能到手的千万架推土机、挖土机、起重机，那么还是没有用处，虽则这样的幻想将来也会实现，但今天还是要从实际出发，脱离了今天的实际，就说不上明天的丰收。当然，如果一个人缺乏幻想或理想，什么也不想，而是做一天和尚撞一天钟，那么他只有停滞倒退。
    文学里有神话，有浪漫主义，甚至有牛鬼蛇神的“鬼话”（比如“聊斋”），但是除了有些是使人消极妥协颓废出世的糟粕以外，也还有一部分积极的东西。它们会激起人们对丑恶现实的反抗，对光明理想的追求。屈原的“离骚”充满了多么光辉高尚的幻想啊！他驾起玉龙凤凰，在虹霓做成的旌旗的簇拥之中，飞翔到一个光明世界中去，那儿有神仙美女奇花异草，再也容不下奸人坏蛋。诗人的壮丽的幻想千百年来鼓舞着人们，不管道路多么长，也还是要追求探索。
    最近发表的毛主席的蝶恋花词，感人之深也在此。为人民事业而牺牲的烈士，飞翔到了月宫，在那儿，吴刚请他们喝酒，嫦娥为他们舞蹈，哀悼的眼泪化作了灌溉大地的甘雨。那是多么壮丽的幻想，多么宽阔的胸怀！它唤起人们对历史对现实对未来的无限乐观的精神。
    周扬同志在报告中说，作家要“敢于幻想”。这是振奋人心的号召。许多伟大的文学家同时也是伟大的幻想家。当然，文学里的幻想和实际工作中的幻想或者理想不完全一样。但是能够幻想的决不限于文学家。文学家要幻想，非文学家也要幻想。劳动人民是富于幻想，敢于幻想，也勇于实践的。跑马乡的以及全国各地在大跃进中积极发挥创造性的农民和干部，就是这样的人。
    让我们的幻想健康地飞翔起来吧！
