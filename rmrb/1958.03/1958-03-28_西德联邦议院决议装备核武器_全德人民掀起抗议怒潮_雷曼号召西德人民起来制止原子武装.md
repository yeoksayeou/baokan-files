Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Bonn dispatch: The West German Federal Parliament's debate on whether to equip the West German army with atomic weapons concluded on the evening of the 25th after four days of fierce verbal battles.

Ignoring the powerful wave of mass protests and disregarding the accusations of opposition party members, the Bonn government party, using its manipulated parliamentary majority, forcibly passed a resolution demanding that the West German army obtain "the most modern weapons."

The Adenauer government's determination to defy the will of the people and persist in arming the West German army with atomic weapons has aroused increasingly strong protests from the German public.

The Central Council of the German-Soviet Friendship Association, representing 3.5 million members, sent a letter to the Speaker of the Federal Parliament, Gerstenmaier, requesting that the West German Parliament respect the German people's desire for peace and accept the Soviet Union's proposals for easing international tensions.

On the same day that the Federal Parliament voted on the atomic armament proposal, a rally against the threat of atomic war was held in the Democratic sector of Berlin, attended by working people from both parts of the city of Berlin.

In West Germany, a mass rally was also held in the city of Herne in North Rhine-Westphalia. Representatives of 27 local organizations of the West German Metalworkers' Union, with 180,000 members, have unanimously passed a statement firmly protesting against turning West Germany into a base for launching atomic warhead rockets.

On the evening of the 24th, Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, called on all West German people through the German 904 Free Radio Station to actively take mass struggle actions to stop West Germany from engaging in atomic armament. He said, "The nation is at a critical juncture and a nationwide resistance must be carried out." Reimann called on the entire West German working class to demonstrate its determination to fight for peace by holding political strikes.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：波恩消息：西德联邦议院关于是否要用原子武器装备西德军队的辩论在经过四天激烈舌战之后已经在25日晚上结束。
    不顾群众的强大抗议浪潮，也不理反对党议员的指责，波恩政府党利用它所操纵的议会多数，强行通过了一项关于要求让西德军队获得“最新式武器”的决议。
    阿登纳政府决心违抗人民的意志，坚持以原子武器武装西德军队的做法引起了全德公众日益强烈的抗议。
    德苏友好协会中央理事会代表三百五十万会员致函联邦议院议长格斯登美尔，要求西德议会尊重德国人民的和平意志，接受苏联缓和国际紧张局势的建议。
    在联邦议院表决原子武装议案的同一天，柏林民主区举行了反对原子战争威胁的大会，到会的有柏林市两个部分的劳动人民。
    在西德，北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州的海尔尼市也举行了群众大会。拥有十八万会员的西德五金工人工会有二十七个地方组织的代表已经一致通过声明，坚决抗议变西德为发射带原子弹头的火箭的基地。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼24日晚上通过德国九○四自由广播电台，号召全体西德人民积极采取群众性斗争行动，来阻止西德从事原子武装。他说，“民族正处在紧急关头，必须进行全民性的抵抗”。雷曼号召西德全体工人阶级通过举行政治性罢工来显示自己为保卫和平而斗争的决心。
