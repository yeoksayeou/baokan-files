Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 29th: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, Bulgaria has begun construction on a new batch of coal mines this year. Once completed, these mines will increase the country's total annual coal production to 13 million tons, nearly six times more than in 1939.

Last year, Bulgaria mined 11 million tons of coal, an increase of 9 million tons compared to 1939. One of the largest coal mines put into operation this year is the "Republic-Second" mine in the Dimitrov coal region. Its reserves are sufficient for ten years of mining. It is planned that this mine will produce 200,000 tons of coal by the end of this year, and 800,000 to 1 million tons of coal next year. Another new coal mine, the "Popov-Second" mine, can supply the country with approximately 550,000 tons of coal annually. With such a production capacity, this mine's reserves are sufficient for 35 years of mining. The "East Maritza" coal mine, which is about to be put into operation, will be the largest coal mine in the country in terms of production capacity.

Bulgaria is one of the countries in the world with abundant coal deposits. So far, the proven reserves of various types of coal total approximately 3,833 million tons.

    保又开始建设一批新煤矿
    建成后煤产量将达一千三百万吨
    新华社索非亚29日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚今年又开始建设一批新的煤矿。这些煤矿建成以后可以使全国每年的采煤总量增加到一千三百万吨，即比1939年增加差不多六倍。
    去年，保加利亚开采了一千一百万吨煤，比1939年增加了九百万吨。今年投入生产的最大的煤矿之一是季米特洛夫煤区“共和国—第二”煤矿。这个煤矿的储藏量足供十年开采。预定到今年年底这个矿井要开采二十万吨煤，而明年将开采八十万吨到一百万吨煤。另一个新煤矿“波波夫—第二”煤矿每年约可供给国家五十五万吨煤，在这样的开采能力下，这个矿的储藏量足供开采三十五年。即将投入生产的“东马里查”煤矿将是全国生产能力最大的煤矿。
    保加利亚是世界上煤藏量丰富的国家之一。到现在为止已经发现的各种煤的蕴藏量共约有三十八亿三千三百万吨。
