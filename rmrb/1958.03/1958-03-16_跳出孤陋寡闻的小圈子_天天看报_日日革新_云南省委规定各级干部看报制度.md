Break Out of the Narrow Circle of Ignorance
    Read Newspapers Daily, Innovate Daily
    Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Stipulates Newspaper Reading System for Cadres at All Levels
    (Yunnan Daily News) The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on March 2 regarding the stipulation of a newspaper reading system for cadres. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    In the great leap forward of socialist construction, the situation across the country is changing rapidly. In every region and on every front, there are new achievements, new creations, new experiences, and new methods emerging at every moment. Every leading cadre must be sensitive to new things, first of all, attaching importance to their own advanced creations and experiences, and also attaching importance to the advanced experiences and creations of others and other regions, and resolutely promoting them. One of the extremely important methods of absorbing new things is to read newspapers, because newspapers reflect new things most timely, richly, and vividly, and also frequently reflect the Party Committee's guidance on various major tasks. Among our leading cadres at all levels, many people do not read newspapers very well because they are too busy and have not improved their working methods; there are also individual comrades who do not read newspapers at all. In order to enable leading cadres at all levels to break out of the circle of limitations and avoid falling into ignorance and parochialism, it should be stipulated that:
    (1) Heads and deputy heads of all departments of the Provincial Party Committee, heads and deputy heads of all departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee, and cadres above the level of secretary of the prefectural and municipal Party committees must read at least three newspapers from other provinces in addition to the Yunnan Daily and the People's Daily, especially newspapers from neighboring provinces with situations relatively similar to ours. Cadres at the level of county party secretary must read at least one newspaper from another province in addition to the Yunnan Daily and the People's Daily.
    (2) In addition to first paying attention to the creations and experiences within their own region and scope of work when reading newspapers, they should combine theory with practice, study the advanced experiences, advanced creations, and revolutionary drive of other regions and other work scopes, in order to improve leadership methods. For things of universal significance, they should be quickly applied to their own practice and developed, so that the experiences and creations of others and other regions can become a boost to our progress.
    (3) Leading cadres at all levels should attach importance to using newspapers to guide their work, such as: organizing and guiding cadres to read newspapers, personally taking action and guiding cadres to summarize experiences, write articles, etc., and organizing and guiding grassroots cadres to use wireless and wired broadcasts to disseminate and learn from advanced experiences.

    跳出孤陋寡闻的小圈子
    天天看报　日日革新
    云南省委规定各级干部看报制度
    本报讯　云南日报消息：中共云南省委在3月2日发出关于规定干部看报制度的通知。通知全文如下：
    在社会主义建设大跃进中，全国各地形势一日千里，各个地区，各个战线，时刻都有新的成就，新的创造，新的经验，新的方法。每个领导干部，必须对于新鲜事物具有敏感，首先是重视自己的先进的创造和经验，也重视别人的，别的地区的先进的经验和创造，而且坚决地推广它。吸取新鲜事物的极为重要的方法之一就是看报，因为报纸最及时，最丰富，最生动地反映新鲜事物，也经常地反映了党委对各项主要工作的指导。我们各级领导干部中，许多人由于太忙，没有很好地改善工作方法，报纸看得很少；也有个别同志，根本不看报。为了使各级领导干部跳出局限性的圈子，避免陷入孤陋寡闻、坐井观天的情况，应当规定：
    （一）省委各部正副部长，省人民委员会各正副厅、局长和地、市委书记以上干部，除了必须看云南日报和人民日报之外，至少要看三份外省的报纸，特别是与我们情况比较接近的邻省的报纸。县委书记一级干部，除了看云南日报和人民日报之外，至少看一份外省的报纸。
    （二）看报除了首先重视自己地区、自己工作范围的创造和经验之外，应当结合实际，研究别的地区，别的工作范围的先进的经验，先进的创造，和革命干劲，以提高领导方法。对于有普遍意义的东西，应当迅速地运用到自己的实践中去，并且加以发展，使别人的、别的地区的经验和创造成为我们前进的助力。
    （三）各级领导干部应当重视运用报纸去指导工作，如：组织和指导干部看报，亲自动手和指导干部去总结经验，写文章等，和组织指导基层干部利用无线和有线广播，传播学习先进经验。
