    Welcoming Japan's "White Haired Girl" – Matsuyama Mikiko
    Tián Hàn
    After more than a year of preparation, the Japanese Matsuyama Mikiko Ballet Troupe has finally come to China.
    Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko is a very famous progressive ballet dancer in Japan. She has been studying ballet since she was fourteen years old, and now has twenty-two years of experience. She is a student of the famous dancers Yelena Bavrina and Olga Sapriagina, and received strict training from them from an early age. In previous years, she also received guidance from Ulanova and Lepeshinskaya in the Soviet Union.
    Ten years ago, she founded the ballet troupe named after herself, and under very difficult conditions, she persisted in the education and popularization of ballet art, and performed classical masterpieces such as "Swan Lake," "Giselle," and "Don Quixote." Last year, her performance of "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai" received high praise at the Japan Arts Festival.
    As a dancer, Matsuyama Mikiko's respectability is not limited to her diligent study of dance art, day after day for twenty years, and her contribution to the dissemination and development of ballet art, but also lies in her persistence in striving for the progressive struggle of her motherland and the peace movement in the East and the world through ballet art. She has used Japanese folk tales to create some ballets with progressive significance and strong national characteristics, and what made her quickly famous in the East was her ballet adaptation of our opera "The White Haired Girl." When our old playwright, Comrade Ouyang Yuqian, visited Japan the year before last, he was deeply moved after watching excerpts from "The White Haired Girl." He said:
    "Ms. Matsuyama Mikiko is not satisfied with the simple transplantation of ballet, but wants to combine it with the lives of the Eastern people, create new artistic images to serve the Eastern people, which is a respectable aspiration.
    "Matsuyama Mikiko, who plays Xi'er, and Ishida Taneko, who plays Dachun, use their skilled dance techniques to portray the complex emotions of the characters, and fully express their inner lives according to the circumstances at the time, without showing off their skills at all, so that people cannot help but feel deep sympathy for this pair of young men and women. The dance image in this scene is also very beautiful, simple, and full of enthusiasm and infinite poetry. After watching this performance, I feel that it is entirely possible to express the life of Eastern peasants in the form of ballet."
    Due to the success of this play in Japan, not only the Chinese dance community, but also the Chinese cultural community are eagerly looking forward to the performance of the ballet "The White Haired Girl" in China. The China Peking Opera Theater and the Ping Opera Theater have already planned to adapt "The White Haired Girl" into opera, but there has been no mention of adapting it into a ballet. The visit of the Matsuyama Mikiko Ballet Troupe to China will not only allow us to learn from their experience, but also meet the artistic appreciation needs of the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward.
    In 1955, after Matsuyama Mikiko attended the World Peace and Friendship Youth Festival in Helsinki, she passed through Beijing, and Premier Zhou Enlai invited Wang Kun, Guo Lanying, and Tian Hua, several Chinese White Haired Girls, to meet her. A photo was also taken, which is also a beautiful bond in the art and culture between China and Japan.
    In addition to "The White Haired Girl," the Matsuyama Mikiko Ballet Troupe will also perform other ballets. We have high expectations for this.
    When the Ichikawa Ennosuke Troupe performed in Beijing, I talked to Ms. Mikiko about welcoming her to perform in China. Last year, her husband, Mr. Shimizu Masao, also came to Beijing to discuss the visit procedures and spent New Year's Eve with Mr. Mei Lanfang and me. Now, all the members of the Matsuyama Mikiko Ballet Troupe have finally arrived. Playwright Tsuchi Noriyoshi has also come with them! Early spring, when ten thousand horses are galloping and hundreds of flowers are waiting to bloom, is the best season to welcome this artistic delegation from our neighboring country.
    Comrades who have heard Xi'er's song, come and see Xi'er's dance! If the Xi'ers saw the situation of the nationwide production Great Leap Forward today, how could she not dance! (Attached picture)

    迎日本的“白毛女”——松山树子
    田汉
    经过一年多的酝酿，日本松山树子芭蕾舞团终于到中国来了。
    松山树子女士是日本很有名的进步的芭蕾舞演员，从她十四岁开始学习芭蕾舞起，到现在已经有二十二年的艺龄了，她是名舞蹈家叶丽亚娜·巴甫诺娃和奥利伽·莎瓌亚的学生，从小受过她们严格的训练；前些年，她到苏联又受过乌兰诺娃和列普辛斯卡娅的指导。
    十年前她成立以她自己命名的芭蕾舞团，在十分困难的条件下坚持芭蕾舞艺术的教育和普及工作，演出了“天鹅湖”，“吉赛尔”，“吉诃德先生”等古典名作，去年演出的“泪泉”，得了日本艺术节的高度褒奖。
    作为舞蹈演员，松山树子的可尊敬还不止于她对舞蹈艺术的刻苦钻研，二十年如一日，和对于传播和开拓芭蕾舞艺术的功绩，而在于她坚持通过芭蕾舞艺术尽力于她祖国的进步斗争和东方及世界的和平运动。她曾经用日本的民间故事编过一些有进步意义的民族色彩浓厚的舞剧，而使她迅速名满东方的是她把我们的“白毛女”歌剧芭蕾舞化。我们的老戏剧家欧阳予倩同志前年访问日本的时候，看过“白毛女”的片断练习已经十分感动。他说：
    “松山树子女士不满足于单纯芭蕾舞的移植，而想把它和东方人民的生活相结合，创造新的艺术形象为东方人民服务，这是可尊敬的愿望。
    “演喜儿的松山树子和演大春的石田种生以熟练的舞蹈技术刻划人物的复杂感情，完全根据当时的情境表现他们的内心生活，丝毫没有卖弄技巧的地方，使人们对这一对青年男女不能不寄以深厚同情。这一场的舞蹈形象也非常优美朴素，热情洋溢，有无限诗意。看了这场演出我觉得用芭蕾舞形式表现东方农民生活完全是可能的。”
    由于此剧在日本的成功，中国舞蹈界不用说，中国文化界也热切地期待芭蕾舞“白毛女”在中国的演出。中国京剧院，评剧院已经计划“白毛女”的戏曲化，但把它舞剧化还没有听得说。松山树子芭蕾舞团的访华不但使我们得到借鉴，也将满足大跃进中中国人民艺术欣赏的要求。
    1955年松山树子出席赫尔辛基世界和平与友谊联欢节之后回来经过北京，总理周恩来同志曾经邀王昆、郭兰英、田华几位中国白毛女跟她相见。还拍了一张照片，这也是中日两国艺术文化上美丽的因缘。
    这次松山树子芭蕾舞团除“白毛女”以外还将演出其他的舞剧。我们对此有很高的期待。
    市川猿之助剧团北京演出的时候，我跟树子女士谈过欢迎她来中国演出。去年她的爱人清水正夫先生也来过北京，商量来访手续，还跟梅兰芳先生和我欢度大年夜。现在，松山树子芭蕾舞团全体人员终于来了。戏剧家土乃与志同志也同来了！万马奔腾，百花待放的早春，正是欢迎邻邦这一艺术使团最好的季节。
    听过喜儿的歌的同志们，都看看喜儿的舞吧！喜儿们若看了今天全国生产大跃进的情况她怎么能不舞呢！（附图片）
