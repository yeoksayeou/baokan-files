Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 21st: Hebei Province plans to build a number of small hydropower stations this year by utilizing existing reservoirs and canal projects. The implementation of this plan will not only fully utilize the effectiveness of existing water conservancy projects but also greatly promote the rapid development of county and township industries and agricultural production.

According to preliminary plans from various localities, this year, they are preparing to build fifty-seven hydropower stations utilizing reservoir and canal projects. They plan to install more than fifty generators ranging from 20 kilowatts to 500 kilowatts, with a total generating capacity of over 7,100 kilowatts. Most of these power stations will utilize the existing structures of reservoirs and canals, without constructing new dams. They will only dig a water diversion channel next to the reservoir and canal sluice gates to serve as the power station's intake channel. Therefore, the construction costs are low, investment is small, and construction is fast.

Nine of the hydropower stations planned to be built are located on medium-sized reservoirs. These hydropower stations, generating two to three hundred kilowatts, can supply existing industries in nearby towns and mines to expand production. They can also establish new small-scale industries and workshops around the power stations, utilizing local materials for on-site processing. The other dozens of small power stations will be scattered along several larger canals, and their electricity will mainly serve agricultural cooperatives for irrigation, processing, and lighting.

In order to realize the above plan, the industrial departments of Hebei Province are currently trial-producing small generators, and the Water Conservancy Department is also planning to train technical personnel for station construction.

    河北利用水库渠道修电站
    新华社保定21日电　河北省今年利用水库和渠道工程修建一批小型水力发电站。实现这一计划，不仅可以充分发挥现有水利工程的效能，同时也将大大促进县乡工业和农业生产的迅速发展。
    根据各地的初步计划，今年准备利用水库和渠道工程兴建的水力发电站有五十七处，计划安装二十瓩到五百瓩的发电机五十多台，总发电容量七千一百多瓩。这些发电站大部分利用水库水渠的现有工程，不再修筑拦水坝，只在水库和渠道的水闸旁边挖一条引水沟作电站的进水道。因此造价低，投资少，建设快。
    计划兴建的这批水电站，有九处是建筑在中型水库上的。这些发电两三百瓩的水电站，可以供附近城镇厂矿现有工业扩大生产，也可以在电站周围新建小工业和作坊，就地取材，就地加工。另外几十座小电站将分散在几条较大的渠道上，它的电力主要是服务于农业社的灌溉、加工和照明。
    为了实现上述计划，河北省工业部门正在试制小型发电机，水利厅也在计划训练建站的技术人员。
