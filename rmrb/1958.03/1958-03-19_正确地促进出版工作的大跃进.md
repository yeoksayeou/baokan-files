    Correctly Promote a Great Leap Forward in Publishing Work
    The National Publishing Work Leap Forward Conference held in Shanghai has now concluded. This conference was convened on the basis of the decisive victory achieved by the people of the whole country in the struggle against the Rightists and in the revolution on the political and ideological fronts; it was held in the midst of the vigorous anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement being carried out throughout the country, that is, in the movement of the great leap forward in socialist production and culture. This is a conference for the publishing work to oppose waste and oppose conservatism, and a conference for the publishing work to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced.
    At this conference, after extensive airing of views and debates, criticisms and self-criticisms were carried out, the achievements of the past few years were affirmed, and work experiences were exchanged. At the same time, the shortcomings and errors in the work were thoroughly exposed. The central issue of the debate was the current guiding principles, tasks and objectives of publishing work, and how publishing work can better serve socialist construction. The conference demanded that a consistent and clear understanding be reached on this issue, so that the leap forward in publishing work has a clear direction, thereby mobilizing all publishing workers, boosting their morale, speeding up their pace, and effectively strengthening and improving their work to serve the great leap forward in production.
    Publishing work is a part of the superstructure, a tool for disseminating ideas and cultural and scientific knowledge. It must serve the economic base and the entire socialist construction, and serve the development of social productive forces. Generally speaking, under the leadership of the Party, our cause has a clear understanding of this. The direction of our cause is the socialist direction, and our publications have played a significant role in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, the achievements of publishing work are the main aspect. However, does every publishing worker have a clear understanding of this issue? In terms of the actual situation of each of our work departments, can we all meet this requirement? That is far from the case. There are still many shortcomings in our publishing work. For example, in the publication of books, there have been phenomena of blindly pursuing quantity and producing shoddy goods; in distribution work, there are capitalistic management viewpoints; in publishing and distribution work, there is also Right-leaning conservative thinking. This was even more prominent in 1957. Although these shortcomings do not occupy a major position in the entire publishing work, if they are not overcome, they will inevitably hinder the progress of the work and lead the leap forward in the wrong direction.
    In our situation, the leap forward in publishing work must first greatly improve quality and publish more good books that are truly needed by the country and the people. Our task is to consciously, directly and indirectly serve the development of production. We must coordinate with the great leap forward in industrial, agricultural and handicraft production to serve the development of the socialist economy, and at the same time, coordinate with the great leap forward in culture to serve the development of socialist science, culture and education. Publishing is a powerful tool of the Party and the people, and it must serve politics, that is, it must serve socialist construction. It must never be publishing for the sake of publishing, or distribution for the sake of distribution. Separated from political work is like a person losing his mind, the work will lose its direction and become meaningless. Published books are different from ordinary commodities. They are tools with ideological content. Therefore, publishing work also undertakes the task of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology on the ideological front. Ultimately, it is to be conducive to promoting the development of productive forces. If our work is done well, it can promote the great leap forward in production; otherwise, it may directly or indirectly have an adverse impact on the development of production. The number of published books should also have a leap forward, but it must be based on the current and long-term interests of the country, based on the needs of the majority and the minority, distinguishing between advanced, intermediate, and elementary books, distinguishing between Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern books, and distinguishing between primary and secondary, and urgency. In short, it must be selective based on whether it is beneficial to the development of social productive forces and the degree of benefit. We must never leap forward across the board.
    In order to make publishing work closely coordinate with the great leap forward in production and serve the great leap forward in production, publishing departments must obtain the close leadership of local Party committees. The publishing work in Jiangsu Province is a good example. The work of the province's publishing houses has been significantly improved because the provincial Party committee has grasped the leadership and regarded it as an important weapon in leading the great leap forward in production movement, thereby driving the leap forward in publishing work. First of all, thanks to the leadership of the provincial Party committee, the problem of topics for the publishing house was solved, so that the topics of the publishing house were closely integrated with the local reality and could truly meet the needs of industrial and agricultural construction and the masses. Secondly, through the mobilization and organization of the Party committee, the problem of manuscripts and writers was solved. For example, a series of high-yield experience books was quickly compiled through the cooperation of the publishing house and cadres and masses with practical production work experience. Third, under the guidance and promotion of the Party committee, publishing workers have improved their working methods and style, so that they can purposefully connect with reality, connect with the masses, and connect with writers. More importantly, the close leadership of the provincial Party committee has improved the thinking of publishing workers, so that publishing workers can timely understand the overall situation and the work situation and tasks of the province. There are many examples like Jiangsu Province that grasp the leadership of publishing work and make publishing work closely serve the great leap forward in production. Facts have proved that publishing work can only effectively play its role in the cause of socialist construction under the close leadership of the Party committee. Thanks to the close leadership of the Party committee, the working methods and working style in the publishing departments have been significantly improved, and the mass line working method has been gradually established. In some places, publishing workers have gone deep into agricultural cooperatives for a long time to study the needs of rural areas for publications, help farmers summarize production experience, and compile books on production experience on the spot. In some places, the main force of the editorial department of publications aimed at farmers and rural cadres has been transferred from the city to the countryside, using a combination of typical examples to edit publications. The working methods and working style of divorcing from reality, divorcing from the masses, and running the society behind closed doors are completely incompatible with the requirements of the great leap forward in publishing work. Several major tasks in the publishing department, such as how to formulate their own topic plan based on the needs of the country and the masses, such as organizing a team of authors, and editing and reviewing manuscripts, must adopt the mass line method. An important part of the great leap forward in publishing work is the great leap forward in publishing work methods.
    Publishing work is one aspect of work on the ideological front. To make the publishing work a great leap forward, it is necessary to greatly strengthen the ideological work of the publishing team and promote the great leap forward in the thinking of the publishing team. The improvement of publishing work requires a team that is both red and expert. The current domestic and international situation is very good, and the situation of the great leap forward in production and the great leap forward in culture has prepared good conditions for the great leap forward in thinking and the improvement of knowledge level of our team. Publishing workers across the country should boost their morale, work hard, and promote the great leap forward of the publishing team in terms of political, ideological and professional level in the high tide of socialist construction, to ensure the great leap forward in publishing work.

### 正确地促进出版工作的大跃进

    正确地促进出版工作的大跃进
    在上海举行的全国出版工作跃进会议，现在已经结束了。这次会议是在全国人民经过反右派斗争，在政治战线和思想战线上的革命取得决定性的胜利基础上召开的；是在全国各地正在轰轰烈烈地开展着反浪费反保守的运动中，也就是在社会主义的生产大跃进和文化大跃进的运动中举行的。这是一个出版工作的反浪费反保守的会议，是出版工作比先进赶先进的会议。
    这次会议，经过了大鸣大放和大争大辩，展开了批评与自我批评，肯定了过去几年来的成绩，交流了工作的经验，同时彻底地揭发了工作中的缺点和错误。辩论的中心问题，是目前出版工作的方针任务和目的，出版工作怎样能更好地为社会主义建设服务。会议要求在这个问题上取得一致的明确的认识，使出版工作的跃进有一个明确的方向，从而动员全体出版工作者，鼓起干劲，快马加鞭，有效地加强和改进自己的工作，为生产大跃进服务。
    出版工作是上层建筑的一部分，是传播思想和文化科学知识的一种工具，它必须为经济基础服务，必须为整个社会主义建设服务，为发展社会生产力服务。我们的事业，在党的领导下，就总的方面来说，这种认识是明确的。我们事业的方向，是社会主义的方向，我们的出版物，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，曾经起了重大的作用，因而出版工作的成绩是主要的。但是，我们每个出版工作者是否对这个问题都有了明确的认识呢？就我们每个工作部门的实际状况来说，是否都能符合这种要求呢？那就远不是这样。在我们的出版工作中，还存在着不少缺点。例如，书籍出版工作中曾经有盲目追求数量，粗制滥造的现象；在发行工作中存在着资本主义的经营观点；在出版和发行工作中，同时还存在着右倾保守思想。这一点，在1957年更为显著。这些缺点，虽然在整个出版工作中不占主要的地位，但是如果不加克服，必然会妨碍工作的前进，把跃进引向错误的方向。
    就我们的情况来说，出版工作的跃进，首先必须大大地提高质量，多出真正为国家和人民群众所需要的好书。我们的任务，就是要有意识地、直接地间接地为发展生产服务。要配合工业、农业、手工业生产的大跃进，为发展社会主义的经济服务，同时又要配合文化的大跃进，为发展社会主义的科学和文教事业服务。出版是党和人民的一种有力工具，它必须为政治服务，就是说要为社会主义建设服务。决不能为出版而出版，为发行而发行。脱离了政治工作就像一个人丧失了头脑一样，工作就会迷失方向，变成毫无意义。出版的书籍同一般的商品不同，是一种具有思想内容的工具，因此，出版工作在思想战线上还担负着兴无灭资的任务。归根结蒂，是要有利于促进生产力的发展。我们的工作做得好，就能够促进生产的大跃进，否则，也可能会直接地、或间接地对生产的发展产生不利的影响。出版书籍在数量上也应该有跃进，但是必须分别情况，按照国家目前和长远的利益，根据多数人和少数人的需要，分别高级的、中级的、初级的书籍，分别中外古今的书籍，分别主次和轻重缓急，加以统筹安排。一句话，必须看它对发展社会生产力是否有利和有利的程度有所选择，决不能一律跃进。
    要使出版工作紧密地配合生产大跃进，为生产大跃进服务，出版部门必须取得各地党委的密切领导。江苏省的出版工作，就是一个很好的例子。这个省的出版社工作，由于省委抓紧领导，把它看成自己在领导生产大跃进运动中的一个重要武器，因而带动了出版工作的跃进，使工作有了显著的进步。首先，由于省委的领导，解决了出版社的选题问题，使出版社的选题密切结合了当地的实际，能够真正符合工农业建设和群众的需要。其次，经过党委的动员和组织，解决了稿源和作家的问题。例如，一套丰产经验的丛书，经过出版社和有实际生产工作经验的干部和群众的合作，很快就编出来了。第三，出版工作者在党委的指导和推动下，改进了工作方法和工作作风，使他们能够有目的地联系实际，联系群众，联系作家。更重要的是，省委的抓紧领导，提高了出版工作同志的思想，使出版工作者对于整个的形势和本省的工作状况与任务能够及时地了解。像江苏省那样，抓紧领导出版工作，使出版工作紧密地为生产大跃进服务的例子是不少的。事实证明，出版工作只有在党委的密切领导下，才能在社会主义建设事业中有效地发挥自己的作用。由于党委的抓紧领导，出版部门中的工作方法和工作作风有了显著的改进，群众路线的工作方法已经逐步确立起来。有些地方的出版工作者已经长期地深入到农业合作社中去，研究农村对于出版物的需要状况，帮助农民群众总结生产经验，就地编写生产经验的书籍。有的地方以农民和农村干部为对象的刊物，编辑部的主要力量，已从城市转移到农村，用典型结合的方法来编辑刊物。那种脱离实际，脱离群众，关门办社的工作方法和工作作风，同出版工作大跃进的要求是完全不相适应的。出版部门中的几项主要的工作，如怎样根据国家和群众需要制定自己的选题计划问题，如组织作者队伍问题以及编审稿件问题，都必须采取群众路线的方法。出版工作的大跃进中的一个重要部分，就是出版工作方法上的大跃进。
    出版工作是思想战线上的一个方面的工作。要使出版工作大跃进，必须大大地加强出版队伍的思想工作，促进出版队伍的思想大跃进。出版工作的提高，要求有一个又红又专的队伍。现在国内外的形势好得很，生产大跃进和文化大跃进的局面，为我们队伍的思想大跃进和知识水平的提高，准备了良好的条件。全国出版工作者应该在社会主义建设事业的高潮中，鼓足干劲，艰苦努力，促进出版工作的队伍在政治上思想上业务水平上的大跃进，来保证出版工作的大跃进。
