    An Autobiography of a Thermometer
    Wen Ling

    My name is Thermometer, and some people always like to call me a "Fahrenheit and Celsius thermometer." They all praise me as a capable scout.
    At the weather station, I receive a warm welcome from meteorologists. Really, if I didn't tell meteorologists about changes in air temperature, how could they accurately predict the future weather?! My workplace is in a small, beehive-like white house in the observation field of the weather station.
    I also work in hospitals. Every patient has to let me measure their temperature first, and then the doctor can make a diagnosis.
    I also participate in economic construction! Steelworkers need my help because I can tell them whether the temperature inside the furnace is hot enough.
    My body is a very small glass bulb connected to a very thin glass tube. I don't have "internal organs." People fill my body with mercury or dyed alcohol. When it's hot, it climbs up the glass tube, and when it's cold, it falls down again.
    My body looks very simple, and there doesn't seem to be anything complicated about it, but scientists did spend a lot of effort before and after my birth.
    More than 300 years ago, my ancestors were born in the hands of the Italian scientist Galileo. Naturally, they didn't look as beautiful as they do now. They had a glass "head" about the size of an egg, connected to a glass tube with an opening at the bottom. First, the glass bulb was heated, and then the open end of the tube was inserted into colored water. As the glass bulb cooled, the volume of air inside the glass bulb shrank, and the colored water ran up. In this way, the principle of thermal expansion and contraction of the air in the tube and the rise and fall of the water was used to indicate the decrease or increase in temperature.
    Isn't the water running into the glass tube due to pressure? This means that it is not only the height of the water that changes when the temperature changes, but also the air pressure, if it changes, will react. This is both a thermometer and a barometer. It is very inconvenient to have a barometer and a thermometer together, and sometimes they interfere with each other's work. It is better to separate them.
    Galileo's students, Torricelli and Ferdinand, separated the barometer and the thermometer.
    The many lines engraved beside me once troubled scholars: What are they based on? Where do they start?
    Some people suggested taking the coldest or hottest day of the year as the standard. However, the climate changes every year! Moreover, the cold and heat are also different in different places. Others advocated using human body temperature as the starting point. The reason is that human body temperature is about the same everywhere. However, this is not without problems. Because all measuring instruments in the world must preserve a standard model, where can we find a "standard person"? And how to ensure that this person never catches a cold or coughs, does not suffer from malaria, and their body temperature never changes?
    People finally came up with a good solution. When I am together with melting ice, the mercury drops to a certain level and then stops. People call this position the freezing point. People also put my glass bulb on the steam of boiling water, and when the mercury rises to a certain level, it also stops moving. People call this position the boiling point. Setting the freezing point at zero degrees and dividing the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point into one hundred equal parts is the Celsius thermometer. Setting the freezing point at 32 degrees and the boiling point at 212 degrees, dividing the middle into 180 equal parts, is the Fahrenheit thermometer. Taking the freezing point as zero degrees and the boiling point as eighty degrees is the Réaumur thermometer. Although our scales are different, we are close relatives. If people want to convert, they only need to remember this formula: Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the degrees by 9/5 and then add 32; Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 first and then multiply by 5/9.
    If people want to use me to measure high temperatures in industry, they have to use platinum resistance thermometers, optical pyrometers, and thermocouple thermometers. These do not use the thermal expansion and contraction of liquids, but are manufactured based on the principles of optics and electricity. In that way, they can quickly and accurately measure high temperatures of several thousand degrees, and they do not have to be close to high-temperature objects when using them.

### 温度表的自述

    温度表的自述
    闻玲
    我的名字叫温度表，也有些人们总喜欢把我叫做寒暑表，都夸我是个有本领的侦察员。
    在气象台上，我受到了气象学家的热烈欢迎。真的，要不是我把空气温度的变化告诉气象学家，他怎么能准确地预报未来的天气？！我办公的地点是在气象台的观测场上一个像蜂房一样的小白房子里。
    我还在医院里上班，每个病人都要先让我来量一量体温，然后大夫才能诊断。
    我还要参加经济建设呢！炼钢工人就得要我帮助，因为我能告诉他，炉子里的温度，够不够火候。
    一个很小的玻璃球上连了一根很细的玻璃管，这就是我的身体。我没有“五脏六腑”，人们把水银或者染红了的酒精装进了我的身体。热了，它就沿着玻璃管往上爬，冷了，又会落下来。
    看上去，我的身体很简单，似乎没有什么复杂的道理在内，可是在我诞生的前前后后，科学家们确实花费了不少的心血。
    三百多年前，我的祖先在意大利科学家伽俐略的手中诞生了。自然，当初的样子并不像现在这么美观。他们有一个跟鸡蛋一般大的玻璃“脑袋”，下面连着一根底下开口的玻璃管，先将玻璃球加热，然后把管子开口的一头插在有颜色的水里，玻璃球变冷了，玻璃球里面的空气的体积缩小了，有颜色的水便跑了上去。就这样，利用管内空气冷缩热胀和水随着升降的原理，来表示温度的减低或增高。
    水跑进玻璃管里去，不就是因为压力的缘故吗？这就不光是温度改变时水的高低有变化，气压假使有变动，也会起反应，这是温度表，同时也是气压表。气压表和温度表连在一起很不方便，有时它们会彼此干扰工作，还是分开好。
    把气压表和温度表分开的是伽俐略的学生托里拆里和裴迪南。
    刻在我身旁的许多线条，曾经使学者们伤过脑筋：根据什么呢？从哪儿开始呢？
    有人提议，采取一年中最冷或最热的一天作标准。可是，每年的气候都有变化的啊！何况各地的冷热也不一样。又有人主张用人的体温做起点。理由是人的体温无论在哪儿都差不多。但是，这也不是没问题的。因为世界上所有的量器，都要保存一个标准模型，到哪儿去找一个“标准的人”呢？并且还要使这个人永远不伤风咳嗽，不患疟疾，体温永远不变呢？
    人们总算想出了一个好办法。我同将融化的冰在一起的时候，水银下降到一定程度后就停留下来了。人们就把这个位置叫冰点。人们又把我的玻璃球放在沸水的水蒸气上，当水银上升到一定程度以后，也停着不动了。人们就把这个位置叫沸点。把冰点定为零度，在冰点和沸点之间分成一百等分，这就是摄氏温度表了。把冰点定为三十二度，沸点定为二百一十二度，中间分成一百八十等分，就是华氏温度表。以冰点为零度，沸点为八十度，就是列氏温度表。我们的刻度虽不同，却是亲兄弟，人们如果要换算，只需记住这样一个公式：摄氏变华氏，度数乘9/5再加三十二；华氏变摄氏，先减三十二再乘5/9。
    人们要用我来测量工业上的高温，那就得用白金电阻温度计、光学高温计和温差电偶温度计等。这些都不是利用液体的热胀冷缩现象，而是根据光学、电学的原理制造的。那样就能迅速而准确地测量几千度的高温，并且在使用它们的时候，还可以不必靠近高温物体。
