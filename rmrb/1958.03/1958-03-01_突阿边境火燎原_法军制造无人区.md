Xinhua News Agency, 28th: New York dispatch: The Tunisian representative to the United Nations, Mongi Slim, protested in a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 27th that French troops in the Tunisia-Algeria border region had driven 250,000 Algerians from their homes, "creating a no-man's land" there.

The Tunisian representative said in the letter that between February 19th and 20th, 1,600 Algerian refugees had already entered Tunisia, most of whom were elderly people, women, and children. Now these incoming refugees are increasing day by day. They accused the French army of burning their houses, mistreating women, and other atrocities.

    突阿边境火燎原
    法军制造无人区
    据新华社28日讯　纽约消息：突尼斯驻联合国代表蒙吉·斯陵27日在给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一封信中抗议法国军队在突尼斯—阿尔及利亚边境地区，把二十五万阿尔及利亚人驱逐出家园，在那里“制造无人区”。
    突尼斯代表在信里说，在2月19日到20日之间，已经有一千六百个阿尔及利亚难民进入突尼斯，其中大多数是老人、妇女和孩童。现在这些入境难民正在逐日增加。他们控诉了法国军队烧毁了他们的房屋，虐待妇女以及其他种种暴行。
