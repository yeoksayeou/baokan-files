Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 20th - Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda, in a statement published in today's "Indonesia Torch Newspaper," reiterated that the Indonesian government opposes any form of interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. He stated that the position of the Indonesian government cannot be compared with that of the rebel factions.

Prime Minister Djuanda made this statement to the "Indonesia Torch Newspaper" in response to Australian Prime Minister Menzies' remarks. Menzies had stated in his remarks that Australia was willing to act as a "mediator" in the Indonesian situation.

An editorial in the "Indonesia Torch Newspaper" pointed out that Menzies' remarks revealed Australia's intention to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs and concealed a sinister attempt to save the rebel group from falling into the abyss of destruction. Therefore, it was malicious and extremely dangerous.

The "Indonesia Torch Newspaper" warned that the unrest in Indonesia is an internal affair. Indonesia's stance towards the rebels is unwavering, and it refuses to compromise with them. The newspaper concluded that the Indonesian government believes that it is capable of solving the problem itself and hopes that Australia and other countries will not interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 20th - Indonesian Army authorities announced that Indonesian government troops are continuing to pursue the fleeing rebel forces led by Nainggolan, who launched the riots in Medan. The Army authorities stated that 200 rebels fleeing towards Aceh, northwest of Medan, had collectively surrendered to government troops. The Huo Shui Mountain, a vital passage between Medan and Aceh, northwest of Medan, has been occupied by government troops.

Medan Radio broadcast on the evening of the 19th that, according to news from the First Military District, government troops had engaged in a fierce battle with the rebel forces led by Sinta Pohan southeast of Medan in Baimadan Sinta. As a result, 50 rebels were killed and 32 were captured. The weapons seized from the rebels were modern weapons that had never been seen in Medan before.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" today published a report from Medan stating that the American diplomatic mission (the American Consulate) in Medan had contacted the Nainggolan rebel group during its brief occupation of Medan. The "People's Daily" correspondent in Medan said that the reason the Nainggolan rebel group was able to escape before the government troops attacked Medan was because the American diplomatic mission provided them with intelligence.

Observers here believe that this action by the American diplomatic mission constitutes a direct interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. The airdropping of foreign weapons to the rebels in Pekanbaru and the American documents that were found are evidence of interference.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 19th - Lieutenant Colonel Piengadi, director of the press office of the Indonesian Army Headquarters, said on the 19th that the situation in Medan and Pekanbaru is calm and normal. The claim broadcast by the rebel group's radio station that the rebels had reoccupied Pekanbaru and that the rebels still controlled the Medan area is completely untrue. At the same time, Indonesian military authorities said that the government's army and air force are pursuing and annihilating the defeated Nainggolan rebels.

    印度尼西亚内政不容任何干涉
    朱安达总理声明反对外国“调停”
    政府军队乘胜继续追击逃窜的叛军
    新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达在今天的“印度尼西亚火炬报”上发表的声明中重申，印度尼西亚政府反对以任何形式干涉印度尼西亚的内政。他说，印度尼西亚政府的地位不能和叛乱分子的地位相提并论。
    朱安达总理是就澳大利亚总理孟席斯的谈话向“印度尼西亚火炬报”发表这项声明的。孟席斯在谈话中曾经表示，澳大利亚愿意在印度尼西亚的局势中充当“调停者”。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”的社论指出，孟席斯的谈话透露了澳大利亚想干涉印度尼西亚内政，同时隐藏有拯救叛乱集团免于堕入毁灭深渊的阴险企图，因此它是恶意的，也是极端危险的。
      “印度尼西亚火炬报”警告说，印度尼西亚的骚乱是内政问题。印度尼西亚对待叛乱分子的立场是坚定不移的，它拒绝同叛乱分子妥协。这家报纸最后说，印度尼西亚政府认为，它自己有能力解决问题，希望澳大利亚和其他国家不要干涉印度尼西亚的内政。
    新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚陆军当局宣布，印度尼西亚政府部队正在继续追击在棉兰发动骚乱的奈恩戈兰所率领的逃窜叛军部队。陆军当局说，向棉兰西北亚齐逃窜的两百名叛军已经向政府部队集体投降，棉兰和亚齐之间交通必经之地、位于棉兰西北的火水山已经被政府部队占领。
    棉兰电台19日傍晚广播说，据第一军区新闻处的消息，政府部队曾经在棉兰东南的拜马丹先达同辛塔·波汉所率领的叛军部队进行了一场激战，结果，叛军五十人被击毙，三十二人被俘；从叛军手中缴获的武器是棉兰以往没有过的现代武器。
    雅加达“人民日报”今天刊载来自棉兰的消息报道，美国在棉兰的外交机构（美国领事馆）在奈恩戈兰叛乱集团短期盘据棉兰市期间，曾经同奈恩戈兰接触。“人民日报”驻棉兰的记者说，奈恩戈兰叛乱集团所以能够在政府军队袭击棉兰以前逃走，是由于美国外交机构向他们提供了情报。
    这里的观察家认为，美国外交机构的这种行为就是直接干预印度尼西亚的内政的行为。空投外国武器给北干巴鲁的叛乱分子以及搜查出来的美国文件都是干涉的证据。
    新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚陆军总部新闻处处长皮恩加迪中校19日说，棉兰和北干巴鲁情况安静正常。叛乱集团的电台所播送的叛军已经重占北干巴鲁市以及叛军仍然控制棉兰地区的说法是完全不真实的。同时，印度尼西亚军事当局说，政府的陆军和空军正在追歼溃逃的奈恩戈兰叛军。
