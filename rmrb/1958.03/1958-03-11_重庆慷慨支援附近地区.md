    Chongqing Generously Supports Neighboring Areas
    (Our report) In order to promote the great leap forward in local industry in Sichuan and to ensure that the total industrial output value exceeds agriculture within five years, Chongqing has generously agreed to spare no effort in supporting the surrounding special districts and counties.
    At the end of February, the industrial departments of Chongqing held a meeting with representatives from the nine special districts of Jiangjin, Fuling, Wanxian, Daxian, Nanchong, Suining, Neijiang, Luzhou, and Yibin, and agreed on the following measures: 1. Chongqing's factories and mines will immediately clear their warehouses and allocate idle machinery and equipment to the industrial sectors of the special districts and counties. 2. For equipment that is centrally allocated by the state, if the special districts and counties still feel that it is insufficient after allocation, Chongqing will adopt the method of extra production on a contract basis to supply whatever Chongqing can produce; for other equipment, as long as the special districts and counties submit orders, Chongqing will arrange production for whatever it can produce. 3. Assist special districts and counties in designing and manufacturing certain special equipment needed for new factories and mines. Send technical personnel to assist in the construction of new factories in special districts and counties.
    In order to promote the industrial development of special districts and counties faster and better, Chongqing's local industrial departments have also decided to set up small factories in various special districts and counties.

    重庆慷慨支援附近地区
    本报讯　为了促进四川地方工业大跃进，在五年内使工业总产值超过农业，重庆市慷慨答应不遗余力地支援附近各专、县。
    2月底，重庆市工业部门同江津、涪陵、万县、达县、南充、遂宁、内江、泸州、宜宾九个专区的代表们集会，商定了以下几项办法：一、重庆各厂矿立即清理仓库，把闲置的机器设备，拨给专县工业。二、由国家统一调配的设备，调配后，各专、县仍感不足部分，凡是重庆市能生产的就采取额外增产办法包干供应；其他设备，只要专、县提出订货，重庆市能生产的就安排生产。三、帮助专、县设计和制造新建厂矿需要某些专用设备。派遣技术人员协助专、县新厂建设。
    为了更快更好地促进专、县工业发展，重庆市地方工业部门还决定到各专、县去办小型工厂。
