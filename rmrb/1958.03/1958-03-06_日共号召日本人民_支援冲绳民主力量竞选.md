Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 5th: According to today's report in the Japanese "Akahata" [Red Flag], the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 3rd, calling on all party members, workers, and patriotic people to actively support the election struggle of patriotic and democratic forces on Okinawa Island for the Legislative Assembly.

The Okinawa Legislative Assembly election will be held on the 16th, and voters will elect twenty-nine Legislative Assembly members.

The statement calls for support for the demands of the Okinawan people: opposition to turning Okinawa into an atomic base, returning Okinawa to Japan, and implementing the four land principles (i.e., opposing the expansion of land requisition, adjusting land compensation fees, paying rent annually, and demanding compensation for all losses caused by U.S. military requisition), and launching protest movements against the U.S. government.

The statement calls for lodging a serious protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government, which submits to the United States, supports reactionary forces, and causes the Okinawan people to suffer, and for crushing the U.S. conspiracy to suppress the Okinawa Democratic Protection League.

The statement calls for supporting the majority of candidates from the Okinawan patriotic and democratic forces centered on the Okinawa Democratic Protection League, both materially and spiritually.

The statement of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party was issued in response to the appeal made to the Japanese people by Kamekujiro Senaga, Chairman of the Okinawa Democratic Protection League.
