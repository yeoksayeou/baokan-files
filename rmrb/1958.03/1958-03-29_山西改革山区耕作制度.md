    Shanxi Reforms Mountainous Area Farming System
    Implements a "Basic Farmland" system, changing extensive cultivation with low yields to intensive cultivation with high yields, increasing grain production; plants trees and grass on reclaimed land in a planned way, promoting great development of agriculture and animal husbandry.
    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 26th dispatch) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to implement a "Basic Farmland" system in sparsely populated mountainous areas, changing the "extensive cultivation with low yields" method to "intensive cultivation with high yields," fundamentally reforming the extensive and low-yield state of farmland cultivation in mountainous areas.
    This significant agricultural system reform has already begun to be implemented. The content of the "Basic Farmland" system is that in areas with an average of more than five mu of cultivated land per person, each person will only retain five mu of cultivated land as basic farmland, implementing intensive cultivation and meticulous farming. Each agricultural cooperative's "Basic Farmland" will establish a portion of high-yield fields as pioneers to ensure increased total output, break conservative thinking, and change "extensive cultivation with low yields" to "intensive cultivation with high yields." Cultivated land unsuitable for growing crops will be reclaimed in a planned manner, planting pasture and trees. This year, the province plans to reclaim one-tenth of the land that should be reclaimed, and it is expected to be completed by 1962. It is required that each region and agricultural cooperative plan and rank land plots, combining land reclamation with the expansion of irrigated land, ensuring that alfalfa, pasture, and trees are planted with land reclamation, leaving no land idle. This approach can not only change the extensive cultivation phenomenon caused by insufficient labor due to the large amount of cultivated land in the past but also increase unit yield and increase total grain output, making full use of arable land; at the same time, pasture can be planted on reclaimed land to solve the shortage of feed, promoting the great development of agriculture and animal husbandry in mountainous areas.
    This agricultural reform measure is proposed to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture. Many mountainous areas in Shanxi Province are sparsely populated, and they have long followed the habit of extensive cultivation with low yields. According to investigations by relevant departments, there are more than 23 million mu of low-yield land in the province, with an average yield of only 40 to 80 jin per mu. Especially in the mountainous areas of northwestern Shanxi, some areas have an average burden of 15 mu of cultivated land per person, and more than 100 mu of cultivated land per animal. Because of the lack of labor and animal power, they only go to the fields twice for sowing and harvesting. For a long time, the unit yield has been: dozens of jin in good years and more than ten jin in bad years. The entanglement of this part of the land has also affected the processing of major cultivated land. Many agricultural cooperatives have a large amount of land on the one hand, and a shortage of grain year after year on the other hand. After the implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system, it will be beneficial to focus on operating basic farmland to quickly increase the yield per unit area and total output; and it will be beneficial to cultivate farmland and make rational use of steep slope land.
    In recent years, some agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province have piloted the "Basic Farmland" system and achieved results, accumulating some experience. For example, after the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Ningwu County established "Basic Farmland" and abandoned a part of the cultivated land for planting pasture and trees in a planned way, the unit yield per mu increased by 80％, the total output increased by more than 70％, and afforestation and animal husbandry have had "room to use their talents." The relevant leading departments of Shanxi Province have conducted investigations and research in seven counties in northwestern Shanxi, summarized typical experiences, and proposed to promote this work in areas with conditions throughout the province. It is also emphasized that the implementation of the "Basic Farmland" system and the reclamation of land must be carried out in batches and steps in a planned way on the premise of ensuring the continuous increase of total output (calculated on a county basis), that the reclaimed land is not abandoned, and that other economic benefits can be recovered.

    山西改革山区耕作制度
    实行“基本农田”制，改广种薄收为少种多收，提高粮食产量；有计划地在退耕地上种树种草，促进农牧业大发展。
    本报太原26日电　中共山西省委决定在地广人稀的山区实行“基本农田”制度，改变“广种薄收”的作法为“少种多收”，从根本上改革山区农田耕作粗放和低产的面貌。
    这一重大的农业制度改革，已经开始执行。“基本农田”制度的内容是，在每人平均五亩以上耕地的地区，确定每人只留五亩耕地，作为基本农田，实行精耕细作。各地农业社的“基本农田”都建立一部分高额丰产田，作为保证总产量增加、打破保守思想、变“广种薄收”为“少种多收”的先锋地。不适宜种农作物的耕地，则有计划地退耕，种牧草、植树。今年全省计划退耕土地占应退耕地十分之一，预计到1962年退完。要求各地按地区、按农业社，分地块进行规划排队，把退耕工作和扩大水地面积结合进行，作到随退耕随种苜蓿、牧草和发展树木，不闲置一分地。这样做法，不仅可以改变过去因耕地多劳动力不足所造成的耕作粗放现象，并且可以提高单位产量，增加粮食总产量，使应耕土地得到充分利用；同时在退耕地上还能种植牧草，解决饲草不足，促进山区农业、畜牧业的大发展。
    这项农业改革措施，是适应农业大跃进的形势提出的。山西省许多山区地广人稀，长期沿袭着广种薄收、耕作粗放的习惯。据有关部门调查，全省约有二千三百多万亩低产地，平均每亩产量只达四十斤至八十斤。特别是晋西北山区，有的地区每人平均负担十五亩耕地，一头牲口负担耕地百亩以上。因为劳畜力顾不过来，每到播种、收割只下两次地，长期以来单位产量是：好年景几十斤，坏年景十几斤。由于这部分土地牵扯，还影响了主要耕地的加工。许多农业社一方面拥有大量土地，一方面连年缺粮。实行“基本农田”制度后，对集中经营基本农田迅速提高单位面积产量和总产量；对培养农田，合理利用陡田坡地都有好处。
    山西省近几年来已经有一部分农业社试行“基本农田”制度，取得了成绩，积累了一些经验。如宁武县前进农业社建立“基本农田”，有计划地弃耕了一部分耕地种牧草、植树以后，单位亩产量提高了80％，总产量提高了70％多，造林和畜牧工作都有了“用武之地”。山西省有关领导部门曾在晋西北七县作过调查研究，总结了典型经验，提出在全省有条件地区推广这项工作。并且强调提出实行“基本农田”制度和退耕土地，一定要在保证总产量（以县为单位计算）不断提高，退耕地不荒废，并能收回其他经济收益的前提下，分期分批有计划有步骤地进行。
