From northern Shaanxi comes encouraging news: Along the ancient Great Wall, many new green Great Walls have appeared. These are the vast shelterbelts of the Yulin Prefecture. The green Great Wall is rapidly expanding its position and exerting its power, overwhelming the power of the wind and sand in the frontier regions.

Speaking of the dangers of the natural environment, few places probably exceed the Yulin area. It has over two thousand acres of sandy land, with large sand dunes churning like turbulent waves at sea, constantly expanding outwards. Countless farmlands, rivers, villages, and towns have been swallowed by it, and the city of Yulin has been forced to move south several times! In the old days, such natural environments were seen as irresistible and unchangeable. However, in the era when the people became masters of the land, they relied on their organized strength and collective wisdom to constantly overcome and transform the dangerous natural environment. Eight years of hard work have taught the people of the Yulin area how to transform the desert, creating belts of forest several miles wide and hundreds of miles long in the barren land dotted with sand dunes. The desert area is most lacking in water, but they have also developed water conservancy in the desert area. As a result, some of the advancing sand dunes have been fixed, while others have been transformed into oases, and large stretches of sandy land have become fertile fields. The cultivated area has been greatly expanded, and paddy fields with yields of 400 to 800 jin per mu and wheat fields with doubled yields have appeared.

All these vivid changes illustrate a truth: any harsh natural environment can be changed. If areas like Yulin can be turned into forest zones, what place cannot be greened? If deserts can be turned into fertile fields, what barren soil cannot be improved?

The key issue is whether the subjective initiative of people is fully estimated and fully utilized. The responsible comrades of Yulin Prefecture have learned a lesson from leading the masses in the struggle against the desert: "As long as there are people, water, and fertilizer, any vast sand dune can be turned into fertile land." This is indeed a very valuable experience. However, the significance of these three elements—people, water, and fertilizer—is not equal. Here, the most decisive factor is people. With people, if there is no water, ways can be found to find water; if there is no fertilizer, ways can be found to find fertilizer.

The reason why conservatives are always far behind the times and cannot see the possibility of leaps forward is that they do not see the dynamic role of people. When formulating plans and estimating the speed of development, they never take into account the subjective initiative of people, that is, the enthusiasm and creativity of hundreds of millions of people and cadres. Thus, they believe that things can only proceed as before and can only be done slowly. Since agricultural cooperativization, a large number of new things (one might even say "miracles") have appeared in our country. These facts tell us that the transformation of production relations liberates the wisdom and energy of "people" that are stored within, and the speed of development of the productive forces will be immeasurably accelerated; all natural conditions that hinder people from developing production will be rapidly changed under the impact of the power of the liberated people. Conservatives close their eyes to these facts, and they cannot stand at the forefront of the times or act as leaders of the masses, because the masses have run far ahead of them.

The recognition and utilization of the dynamic role of people should be said to be an important hallmark of revolutionaries. Society will advance, and productive forces will develop—people probably will not doubt this. However, if we do not actively organize this movement of progress and development, but only passively wait for conditions to mature, then we cannot be considered revolutionaries, because the progress of society and the development of productive forces cannot be waited for.

By fully estimating and utilizing the dynamic role of people, we can not only defeat the desert in the Yulin area but also defeat all the deserts throughout the country and turn them all into beautiful oases.

    人的能动作用
    宋方渚
    从陕北传来了一个令人鼓舞的喜讯：在古老的万里长城边沿一带，出现了许多条新的绿色的长城，这就是榆林专区的大片防沙林带。绿色的长城正在迅速地扩大它的阵地，施展它的威力，压倒塞上风沙的威力。
    要说自然环境的凶险，恐怕很少有超过榆林地区的了。这里有两千几百亩的风沙区，一座座大沙丘像大海里的惊涛骇浪一样翻腾着，并且不断地向外扩张。无数的农田、河流、村庄和城镇被它吞没了，一座榆林县城竟被它逼得几次南迁！在旧时代，这样的自然环境被看做是不可抗拒、不可改变的。但是，在人民做了土地的主人的时代，人们依靠自己组织起来的力量和集体的智慧，不断地战胜着和改造着凶险的自然环境。八年的苦战，使榆林地区的人民学会了改造沙漠，在沙丘密布的不毛之地造成一条条好几里宽、百十里长的林带。沙漠地区最缺水，但他们也能在沙漠地区开发了水利。于是，一部分向前移动的沙丘固定了，另一部分沙丘变成了绿洲，大块的沙滩变成了良田。耕地面积大大扩展了，还出现了亩产四百斤到八百斤的水稻田，出现了加倍增产的小麦田。
    这一切活生生的变化都说明了一个真理，就是任何恶劣的自然环境都是可以改变的。像榆林这样的地区都可以造成森林地带，还有什么地方不能绿化呢？沙漠都能变成良田，还有什么瘠瘦的土壤不能改良呢？
    问题的关键，在于是不是充分估计并且充分发挥了人的主观能动性。榆林专区负责同志从领导群众对沙漠作斗争中得到一个体会：“只要有人，有水，有肥料，任何广大的沙丘都可以变为良田。”这的确是一个很宝贵的经验。不过，人、水、肥料这三者的意义并不是等同的。在这里，最有决定意义的是人。有了人，没有水可以千方百计找到水；没有肥料可以千方百计找到肥料。
    保守主义者所以老是远远地落在时代的后面，看不见跃进的可能，根源就是他们看不见人的能动性。在制定计划和估计发展速度的时候，总是不把人的主观能动作用，即亿万人民和干部群众的积极性和创造性计算进去。这样，他们就认为事情只能照老样子进行，只能慢慢来。农业合作化以后，大量的新事（也可以说是“奇迹”）出现在我们的国土上。这些事实都告诉我们：生产关系的变革，使蕴藏着的“人”的智慧和精力解放出来，生产力的发展速度将不可限量地加快；一切妨碍人们发展生产的自然条件，将在解放了的人的力量的冲击之下加速改变。保守主义者闭眼不看这些，他们就不能站在时代的前头，不能充当人民群众的领导者，因为人民群众远远地跑到他们的前面去了。
    对于人的能动作用的认识和发挥，应当说是革命者的重要标志。社会会前进，生产力会发展，人们大概都不会怀疑。但是，如果不积极地组织这种前进和发展的运动，而只是消极地坐等条件成熟，那我们就不能算做革命者，因为社会的前进和生产力的发展是坐等不来的。
    充分地估计和发挥了人的能动作用，我们就不仅可以战胜榆林地区的沙漠，还可以战胜全国各地一切的沙漠，使它们统统变成美丽的绿洲。
