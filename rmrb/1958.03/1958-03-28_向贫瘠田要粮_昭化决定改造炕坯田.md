    Seeking Grain from Barren Fields
    Zhaohua Decides to Transform "Kangpi" Fields
    (Our dispatch) The broad masses of peasants in Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, are now taking action to "seek grain from 50,000 mu of barren 'kangpi' fields!"
    After studying experiences in soil improvement, leading comrades of the Zhaohua County Party Committee decided to utilize the gap before rice transplanting to spread fine sand, black manure soil, red vesicular gravel, etc., on the usually low-yielding, dry, and hard "kangpi" fields. Their plan is to first plant green manure. Near the rice transplanting season, some stems and leaves of the planted crops can be cut to be used as vegetables, pig feed, and cattle feed, and the stems and roots can be turned into the soil to rot into green manure, equivalent to general cow manure. This will improve the dead, yellow mud soil quality, and each mu can increase rice production by more than 100 jin.

    向贫瘠田要粮
    昭化决定改造炕坯田
    本报讯　四川昭化县广大农民正行动起来“向五万亩贫瘠的炕坯田要粮！”
    中共昭化县委负责同志在学习了改良土壤的经验介绍以后，决定利用插秧前间隙期，在一向低产的干硬的炕坯田里铺上细纱、黑粪土、红泡沙石等。他们计划首先种上绿肥，到临近栽秧季节，种下的各种作物可以割一些茎叶做蔬菜、猪饲料、牛饲料，并可将茎根翻到泥里沤绿肥、抵一般牛粪。这样死黄泥土质变好了，每亩可增产稻谷一百斤以上。
