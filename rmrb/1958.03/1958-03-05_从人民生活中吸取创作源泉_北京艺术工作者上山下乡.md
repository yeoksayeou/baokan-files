    (Our dispatch) Beijing's many artists are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call, requesting to go to the mountains and countryside to participate in mass production labor or grassroots work, in order to reform themselves, temper themselves, and become familiar with the lives of the people, obtaining the source of artistic creation from the people's lives. Now, the majority of art personnel decided to go down by Beijing's art troupes have already set off, and some are ready to go.

    The music creators who have already gone down or are preparing to go include composers Zheng Lücheng, Zhang Wengang, lyricists Xu Shuren, Guan Hua, Xu Wen, and more than 20 others. They will go to various places to participate in grassroots work or production labor. Guan Hua has gone to Fengrun County, Hebei; Xu Wen will go to Yongxing County, Hunan; Zheng Lücheng will go to Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan; Zhang Wengang is preparing to go to Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan; Jin Fan plans to go to Xingning County, Guangdong; Xu Shuren and Li Zhongyi have formed a creative team and will go to Ding County, Hebei together; Luo Zhongrong is preparing to go to a factory in Beijing. Li Huanzhi, Li Qun, Huo Xiyang, and others have already gone down with the touring performance team, participating in labor on the one hand, and collecting and arranging folk songs on the other. Qu Xixian will also go to Fengrun County, Hebei.

    In the art troupes under the Art Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, more than 300 art performers and researchers went to Liuhe, Baoying, Gaoyou, and Xinghua in Jiangsu Province, Fengrun, Funing, and Zunhua in Hebei Province, and Tonghua in Jilin Province on January 4 and 29 respectively to participate in production labor or grassroots work. They also carried musical instruments and portable props for acrobatics, preparing to conduct some cultural and recreational activities among the masses during the breaks from labor or work, and at the same time conduct some professional exercises.

    Many art workers have also gone down. Painters Gu Yuan, Liu Jiyou, and others have gone to rural areas in Tangshan, Hebei; Fei Shengfu and Zheng Wenzhong have gone to rural areas in Jiangsu; Zhang Wenxin has gone to Nanyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Beijing; Jiang Fan has gone to rural areas in Zhangjiakou Prefecture. They are all determined to undergo self-reform through labor training, in order to create more and better works.

    Before a part of the art workers set off to factories and rural areas, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China invited them to hold a forum. Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, spoke to them, encouraging the art workers to closely integrate with the workers and peasants, reform and temper themselves in labor and struggle, and at the same time study diligently and strive to improve their professional skills, in order to rapidly build a strong, truly working-class art team that is both red and expert.

    从人民生活中吸取创作源泉
    北京艺术工作者上山下乡
    本报讯　北京许多艺术工作者热烈响应党的号召，要求上山下乡，参加群众的生产劳动或基层工作，以便改造自己，锻炼自己，并熟悉人民生活，从人民生活中取得艺术创作的源泉。现在北京各艺术团体决定下去的艺术人员绝大部分已经出发，一部分则整装待发。
    已经下去或正准备下去的音乐创作人员，有作曲家郑律成、张文纲、歌词作家胥树人、管桦、许文等二十多人。他们将到各地参加基层工作或生产劳动。管桦已去河北丰润县；许文将到湖南永兴县；郑律成将到云南大理白族自治州；张文纲准备到云南红河哈尼族彝族自治州；金帆拟去广东兴宁县；胥树人、李中艺结成一个创作小组，将同去河北定县；罗忠熔准备到北京一个工厂。李焕之、李群、霍希扬等，已随巡回演出队下去，一方面参加劳动，同时并搜集和整理民歌。瞿希贤也将到河北丰润县去。
    在文化部艺术局所属各个艺术团体中，三百多个艺术表演人员和研究人员，已于1月4日和29日分别去江苏省的六合、宝应、高邮、兴化，河北省的丰润、抚宁、遵化和吉林省的通化等地参加生产劳动或基层工作。他们还随身携带了乐器和杂技表演的轻便道具等，准备在劳动或工作的空隙时间，在群众中进行一些文化娱乐活动，同时进行一些业务练习。
    许多美术工作者也已经下去。画家古元、刘继卣等，已到河北唐山农村；费声福、郑文中已到江苏农村；张文新已到北京南苑农业社；江帆到张家口专区农村。他们都决心通过劳动锻炼，进行自我改造，以便创作出更多更好的作品来。
    在一部分艺术工作者出发到工厂农村去之前，中共中央宣传部邀集他们举行了座谈，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬、文化部副部长钱俊瑞向他们讲了话，鼓励艺术工作者与工农群众密切结合，在劳动和斗争中改造、锻炼自己，同时要刻苦学习，努力提高业务，以便迅速地建成一支强大的真正工人阶级的又红又专的艺术队伍。
