Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 27th: According to TASS, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, which opened on the 25th, has concluded. The meeting adopted a letter to the French people, calling on left-wing forces to unite and block the path of fascism.

    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party condemned the fascists who demanded the use of violence to continue the policies that have brought shame to France for the past ten years. The plenary session also condemned the propaganda that wants General de Gaulle to return to power.

    The letter to the people stated that the interests, honor, and future of France require the implementation of other policies. Only a government composed of a left-wing majority, implementing policies that conform to the interests of the majority of French people, can be stable, powerful, and truly represent the will of France. All democrats and patriots painfully see that the policies of the Socialist Party leaders have been and are the main obstacle in this regard. The Socialist Party's alliance with the right wing will only benefit fascism. The letter emphasized that all democrats should strive to unite, jointly defend freedom, and immediately organize the masses to counter all attempts by fascists.

    The plenary session also passed a resolution, believing that it is necessary to strengthen the struggle of the people against the deployment of atomic weapons and rocket weapons in France.

    In addition, the plenary session also passed a special resolution to improve the distribution of "l'Humanité," and appointed Étienne Fajon as the director of "l'Humanité." The Central Committee decided to convene the French Communist Party Congress in December of this year.

    法共呼吁左翼力量团结
    堵住法西斯主义的道路
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社巴黎27日讯：25日开幕的法国共产党中央委员会全体会议已经闭幕。会议通过了告法国人民书，呼吁左翼力量联合起来，堵住法西斯主义的道路。
    法国共产党中央委员会谴责法西斯分子，这些法西斯分子要求用暴力手段来继续推行十年来使法国蒙受耻辱的政策。全会还谴责那种要戴高乐将军重新上台的宣传。
    告人民书说，法国的利益、荣誉和前途要求实行另外的政策。只有由左派多数组成政府，执行符合大多数法国人的利益的政策，才能使政府稳定、有力，才能真正代表法国的意志。各派民主人士和爱国者痛心地看到，社会党首领的政策过去和现在都是在这方面的主要障碍。社会党同右翼保持联盟只会对法西斯主义有利。告人民书强调说，所有民主人士应当努力团结一致，共同保卫自由，并且立即组织群众反击法西斯分子的一切企图。
    全会还通过了决议，认为必须加强人民群众反对在法国配置原子武器和火箭武器的斗争。
    此外，全会还通过了改进“人道报”发行工作的特别决议，并且任命艾蒂安·法戎为“人道报”社社长。中央委员会决定在今年12月召开法国共产党代表大会。
