Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 27th: The Feng Bin Model Group, which has safely driven more than 1.25 million kilometers in plateau and mountainous areas, has put forward new plans for the new year. They guarantee that on the basis of safe driving, they will complete the Second Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule; the seven Jiefang (Liberation) brand trucks newly received last July will be driven 150,000 kilometers without major repairs; and fuel consumption and tire quotas will be reduced by 10% to 20% compared to last year.

The Feng Bin Model Group is a group of the Fourth Team of the First Transportation Company of Qinghai Province. During the First Five-Year Plan period, they drove in the mountainous areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi, Sichuan and Xikang, and on the Qinghai-Gansu and Qinghai-Tibet Plateaus, crossing countless mountains and Gobi snow mountains.

    跑得又快又安全
    据新华社西宁27日电  在高原和山区安全行驶一百二十五万多公里的冯斌模范小组，在新的一年里又提出了新的打算。他们保证在安全行驶的基础上，要提前一年完成第二个五年计划；去年7月新领来的七辆解放牌汽车，要做到行驶十五万公里无大修；油料消耗、轮胎定额等都保证比去年降低10％到20％。
    冯斌模范小组是青海省第一运输公司汽车四队的一个小组。他们在第一个五年计划期间曾经先后行驶在川陕、川康等山区和甘青、青藏高原上，翻过了无数的崇山峻岭和戈壁雪山。从1953年4月到1957年12月底，共安全行驶了一百二十五万二千零八十二公里，并且节约了汽油一万二千零五十二公斤。
