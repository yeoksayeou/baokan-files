Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 10th: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, at its enlarged meeting which opened today, passed a statement calling on all Vietnamese people in the North and South to strengthen unity and actively support the letter from Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to Ngo Dinh Diem.

The statement said that the proposals made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the South Vietnamese authorities for mutual disarmament and trade exchange are practical and feasible ways to achieve Vietnamese reunification. The statement pointed out that this peaceful proposal is beneficial to both the South and the North. The statement condemned the United States for interfering in South Vietnam in military, political, and economic aspects, which has led to the failure to unify Vietnam through consultation, the failure to restore normal relations between the North and the South, and the threat to Vietnam's independence and peace in Asia and the world. The statement emphasized the need to stop US interference in South Vietnam.

The enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front is scheduled to last for two weeks. The meeting will study the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Declaration issued in Moscow last year, discuss the current revolutionary situation in Vietnam, summarize the activities of the Fatherland Front in 1957, and formulate plans for 1958.
