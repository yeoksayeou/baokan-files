Xinhua News Agency dispatch, March 12th: The "Double-Anti Movement" has fully blossomed in the universities and colleges of the capital. The vanguard of the movement is fiercely attacking conservatism and digging deep into the ideological roots.

The Double-Anti Movement in the universities and colleges of the capital began on March 1st, and by the 9th, it had fully unfolded in thirty-three schools. By the 11th, over two million big-character posters had been put up. Peking University, Renmin University, Beijing Normal University, and other schools showed even more vigorous momentum. Overnight, all the classroom buildings, dining halls, and auditoriums became big-character poster buildings and halls, decorated in red and green. In the movement, all staff, from the president to the cooks and janitors, used their hands and brains to compare the exposure of problems and the sharing of thoughts. Even the professors kicked away the stumbling block of "a gentleman does not lead the world" and launched into competition. After holding a mobilization meeting, the professors at Peking University posted an average of seven big-character posters each in three hours.

Leading cadres in each school have set themselves on fire with big-character posters. Faculty and staff are embracing the spirit of being kind to others when criticizing them and rejoicing in self-criticism when criticized by others. The big-character posters contain criticisms, self-criticisms, denunciations, and suggestions.

The big-character posters, while affirming achievements, exposed the incalculable waste caused by cultivating talent that does not meet the needs of the state. The Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration and Peking University both raised the issue of "rejects." The so-called rejects refer to students who have not met the prescribed training goals after entering school. In the Department of Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology at the Institute of Geological Exploration, 154 students enrolled in 1953, but only 116 graduated in 1957. The attrition rate reached 25%. Among these "rejects," fifteen were rightists and twelve were violators of school discipline. The "rejection rate" in the Physics, Chinese, and Western Language Departments of Peking University in 1957 also reached over 30%. Some agricultural students at Agricultural University who are about to graduate still can't distinguish between rice and barnyard grass. Students studying farming don't know how to plow, and students studying entomology can't recognize corn borers in the cornfields. At Beijing Medical College, some soon-to-graduate students don't know how to apply plaster bandages and don't know what blowfly pupae are. Graduates who are assigned to work in rural areas and factories don't know how to treat diseases without the equipment of a large city hospital. Students at the Beijing Art Normal College can't sing Chinese folk songs. Recently, when they went to the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site to participate in voluntary labor, people asked them to sing a song. They chose "People All Over the World, One Heart," but after singing two lines, they didn't know the rest. These students are very worried about what they can do for the motherland and the people after graduation. Therefore, they are particularly active, enthusiastic, and courageous in the rectification movement.

Everyone also exposed a particularly noteworthy problem: many students from worker and peasant backgrounds drop out of school halfway through. Of the eleven worker-peasant students in the third year of the Physics Department at Peking University, only four are left. Why? It's not that these students don't work hard, but that teachers discriminate against them, dislike their poor foundations, and don't strengthen their guidance. At the Institute of Geological Exploration, a female textile worker who scored 90 points in every subject at a worker-peasant rapid training school was forced to leave the Institute of Geological Exploration after being absent for three weeks due to giving birth, because no teacher was willing to help her catch up.

The big-character posters exposed all kinds of waste of human and material resources, especially the extravagance in establishing laboratories and purchasing books and instruments, the lack of care for national money, and the pursuit of large-scale and new equipment, which was common in almost every school. Waste of human resources was also very common. Among the more than 200 full and associate professors at Peking University, one-fifth had not taught any courses in recent years, and 66% had only three hours of teaching workload per week. In one department with 81 teachers, each teacher taught an average of only 27 hours of class per year over the past five years. If calculated at eight hours per day, fourteen teachers were actually doing the work of one teacher. Most of the full and associate professors at Beijing Normal University, Agricultural University, and other schools also taught only three hours of class per week.

How did these problems arise? What is the ideological root cause? The cutting edge of the movement in each school is focusing on these issues and vigorously pursuing them.

### 最大的浪费——培养的人材不是又红又专  首都高等学校人人猛攻浪费保守  烧别人与人为善，烧自己闻过则喜

    最大的浪费——
    培养的人材不是又红又专
    首都高等学校人人猛攻浪费保守
    烧别人与人为善，烧自己闻过则喜
    本报特约新华社12日讯  “双反运动”在首都各高等学校已经全面开花。运动前锋正猛攻保守，痛挖思想根源。
    首都各高等学校的双反运动从3月1日开始，9日就在三十三个学校全面展开。到11日止，已贴出大字报二百多万张。北京大学、人民大学、北京师范大学等校气势更加磅礴，一夜之间，所有的教室楼、饭厅、礼堂都成了铺红挂绿的大字报楼，大字报厅。在运动中各校上自院长下至炊事员、勤杂工，人人动手，人人动脑，比揭发问题，比交心。就连教授们也踢开了“君子不为天下先”的绊脚石而展开了竞赛。北京大学的教授们在开完动员会后的三小时，平均每人就贴出了七张大字报。
    各校领导干部在大字报上纷纷引火烧身。教职员工都本着烧别人与人为善，烧自己闻过则喜的精神，在大字报上有批评也有自我批评，有揭发也有建议。
    大字报在肯定成绩的基础上揭发了所培养的人材不合国家要求而造成的无法计算的浪费。北京地质勘探学院、北京大学都提出了“废品”问题。所谓废品是指学生入学后没有达到规定的培养目标而言的。地质学院水文地质及工程地质系，1953年入学的学生一百五十四人，到1957年毕业时只有一百一十六人。耗损率达25％，这些“废品”中十五人是右派，十二人是违反学校纪律的分子。北京大学物理系、中文系、西语系1957年的“废品率”也达30％以上。农业大学农学系有些快毕业的学生还分不清稻子和稗子，学耕作的学生不会犁地，学昆虫的学生，跑到玉米地里认不出螟虫来。北京医学院，有些快要毕业的学生不会扎石膏绷带，碰到了苍蝇蛹不知为何物。分配到农村和厂矿去工作的毕业生，没有大城市医院的设备条件就不会治病。北京艺术师范学院的学生不会唱中国民歌，最近到十三陵水库工地去参加义务劳动，人们请他们唱一个歌，他们自己选了“全世界人民心一条”，唱了两句就不知道下文了。这些学生们都十分担心毕业后为祖国和人民能干些什么。因此，他们整风中特别积极、热情和勇敢。
    大家还揭发了一个特别值得注意的问题，就是工农成分的学生中途停学的多。北大物理系三年级十一个工农学生现在只剩下四个了。为什么？不在于这些学生不努力，而是教师歧视他们，嫌他们基础差，不加强指导。在地质勘探学院一个在工农速成中学门门课考九十分的纺织女工，进地质学院后不到一年，因生孩子耽误了三个星期，没有一个教师愿帮她补课，最后她只好离开了地质学院。
    大字报揭发了人力物力上的种种浪费，特别是建立实验室、购买图书仪器上的阔气，不爱惜国家钱财求大求新的情况，几乎校校皆有。人力上的浪费情况也很普遍，北京大学二百多个正副教授中，几年来有五分之一的人没开课，66％的人一星期只有三小时的教学工作量。有一个系里八十一个教师，五年来平均每人每年只教二十七小时课。如果按照每天八小时计算，实际上十四个教师在做一个教师的工作。北京师范大学、农业大学等校的正副教授多数每周也只上三小时课。
    以上这些问题是怎样产生的？思想根源是什么？各校运动的锋芒正围绕着这些问题猛攻直追。
