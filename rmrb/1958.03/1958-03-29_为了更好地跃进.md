　　For a Better Great Leap Forward

　　While many places are proposing not to waste a single inch of arable land, Shanxi Province has decided to implement a "basic farmland" system in sparsely populated mountainous areas, with plans to gradually return over 23 million mu of land to other uses. These two approaches may seem somewhat uncoordinated at first glance; in fact, they share the same goal through different paths – the Great Leap Forward and increased production.

　　According to the plan of Shanxi Province, after the implementation of the "basic farmland" system in those areas, it can not only increase the unit area yield and total output of grain (taking the county as a unit), but also plant pasture on the returned land to develop animal husbandry; more importantly, it can provide the people in those areas with the conditions to implement intensive cultivation. Therefore, we say that this approach in Shanxi Province is a revolutionary measure; retreating is for advancing, and planting less is for harvesting more.

　　China has a vast territory, and the natural conditions vary greatly from place to place. To make good use of natural conditions to serve mankind, it is necessary to have a good understanding of these special conditions. Therefore, all localities must handle agricultural production issues in accordance with local conditions and the timing.

    为了更好地跃进
    当许多地方都提出不荒废一分耕地的时候，山西省却决定在地广人稀的山区实行“基本农田”制度，有计划地、分期分批地退耕二千三百多万亩土地。这两种做法，乍看起来好像有些不大协调；其实，它们是异途同归，都是为了一个目的——跃进、增产。
    根据山西省的计划，在那些地区实行“基本农田”制以后，不仅可以提高粮食单位面积产量和总产量（以县为单位），还可以在退耕地上种植牧草，发展牧畜业；更重要的，可以使那些地区的人民有了实行精耕细作的条件。因此，我们说山西省的这个做法，是一种革命性的措施，退是为了进，少种是为了多收。
    我国幅员广大，各地自然条件相差很多，要很好地利用自然条件为人类服务，就要很好地认识这些特殊条件。因此，各地必须因地因时制宜地来处理农业生产问题。
