　　Loading and Unloading Efficiency Surpasses London
　　The level of ship loading and unloading time (loading and unloading efficiency) at Dalian Port has now exceeded that of London Port in the United Kingdom. London Port is the largest port in the UK, and its loading and unloading efficiency is the highest in the UK. However, its hourly loading and unloading volume per ship hatch (time level) is far surpassed by Dalian Port. For example, the loading and unloading efficiency of cement in London Port is 30,480 kg to 33,828.8 kg per hour, while in Dalian Port it is 40,000 kg. The loading and unloading efficiency of other commodities also exceeds that of London.
　　Due to the low loading and unloading efficiency of London Port, their ships inevitably stay in port for a long time, and the ship utilization rate is very low. For example, a ship with a net tonnage of 1,794 tons needs to stay in port for six days to unload 4,677 tons of ore in London Port, while in Dalian Port, it only takes 1.24 days.

    装卸效率压倒伦敦
    大连港船舶装卸航时量水平（装卸效率），现在已经超过英国伦敦港的水平。伦敦港是英国第一个大港口，它的装卸效率在英国最高。但是它的船舶舱口每小时装卸量（航时量水平），却被大连港远远地超过了。如水泥的装卸效率，伦敦港每小时为三万零四百八十公斤到三万三千八百二十点八公斤，大连港为四万公斤。其它商品的装卸效率也超过伦敦。
    由于伦敦港装卸效率低，他们的船舶在港停泊时间必然长，船舶运用率很低。例如一艘一千七百九十四净吨的船在伦敦港卸四千六百七十七吨矿砂，需要在港停泊六天，而在大连港，只需一点二四天。
