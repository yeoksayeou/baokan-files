    Ding Guoxian Brings Bangzi Opera to Shishan
    Jijia Gou is the most remote rocky mountain area in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province. The mountains are high and the valleys are deep, and transportation is very inconvenient. The farmers here have very little cultural entertainment. On February 26th, this place suddenly became lively. It turned out that the famous Shanxi Bangzi Opera actress Ding Guoxian and the Shanxi Jin Opera Troupe, which she led, had come to this mountain valley. They performed for three consecutive days, which really delighted the farmers in this area. Old man Ji Wangwu, who is seventy-four years old, smiled and said with tears in his eyes: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, could I have ever seen Ding Guoxian's opera at my doorstep in my lifetime!"
    The actors of the Jin Opera Troupe were moved by the warm hospitality of the masses. Whenever they had time, they helped the villagers carry water and sweep the courtyard. During the morning break each day, they joined the commune members in field labor.

    丁果仙送梆子到石山
    冀家沟是山西省太原市郊区最偏僻的一个石山区，山高沟深，交通很不方便。这里的农民谈不上有多少文化娱乐。2月26日，这个地方忽然热闹起来了，原来著名的山西梆子演员丁果仙和她领队的山西省晋剧一团来到这个山沟沟了。他们一连演出了三天，真把这一带的农民乐坏了。七十四岁的冀望武老汉笑眯眯地含着泪说：“要不是共产党毛主席的领导，我这一辈子还能在家门口看上丁果仙的戏呀！”
    晋剧一团的演员被群众热烈的招待所感动，一有空就帮着老乡们担水扫院，每天上午的休息时，同社员一道参加田间劳动。
