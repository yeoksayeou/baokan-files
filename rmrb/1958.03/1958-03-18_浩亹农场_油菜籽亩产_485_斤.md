    Hao亹 Farm
    Rapeseed Yield of 485 Jin Per Mu
    In 1957, the Qinghai Hao亹 Farm planted 19,170 mu of spring rapeseed, with an average yield of 139 jin of rapeseed per mu, of which 2,000 mu achieved a high yield of 485 jin.
    This farm is located on the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains, 3,000 meters above sea level, with a relatively cold climate and no absolute frost-free period. The main reasons for their bumper harvest were timely sowing to avoid frost damage, increased application of smoked fertilizer to raise ground temperature, and promotion of early maturity of rapeseed. In addition, artificial pollination and topping were used to ensure full pollination, prevent excessive growth, and produce plump seeds.

    浩亹农场
    油菜籽亩产485斤
    青海浩亹农场1957年种春油菜一万九千一百七十亩，平均亩产菜籽一百三十九斤，其中有二千亩获得四百八十五斤的高额产量。
    这个农场位于祁连山南麓，拔海三千公尺，气候较冷，无绝对无霜期。他们获得丰收的主要原因是适时播种，避免霜冻，并增施熏肥，提高地温，促使油菜早熟。此外，还采用了人工辅助授粉和打顶心的办法，使菜籽受粉全、不徒长、结实饱满。
