    Reading "Rare Yuan and Ming Dynasty Zaju Plays"
    Qu Liuyi
    In the 1930s, a major event occurred in the history of Chinese drama: the discovery of the Yuan and Ming dynasty zaju plays collected by Mr. Yeeso. Excluding those that duplicated other versions, this batch of zaju plays included 138 titles that had never been seen before. This not only dramatically increased the number of zaju plays and enriched Yuan and Ming dynasty zaju literature but also provided valuable materials for researchers of zaju plays and their developmental history. Now, this batch of zaju plays has been compiled and printed as "Rare Yuan and Ming Dynasty Zaju Plays" (hereinafter referred to as "Rare Plays"), published by China Drama Publishing House.
    In "Rare Plays," in addition to zaju plays written by famous playwrights such as Guan Hanqing and Wang Shifu, there are also 107 anonymous plays, accounting for three-quarters of the entire collection. This is a unique characteristic of "Rare Plays" that is not found in other collections or printed editions. These unnamed plays are mostly handwritten copies that have never been printed; some were written by actors, and some were popular versions of the teaching guilds after being processed by actors. In terms of content, they are colloquial, simple, and moving; in terms of form, they have more dialogue, fluent conversations, more filler words, and smooth singing. From them, we can also get a glimpse of the true face of the complete versions that were popular in theaters three hundred years ago.
    Another characteristic of "Rare Plays" is that it contains the most plays depicting heroic figures. It enthusiastically sings the praises of famous historical heroes such as Yue Yi, Zhang Liang, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Qin Qiong, and Yue Fei. Most of them are written by anonymous authors. Among them, plays about the Three Kingdoms period are the most numerous, with seventeen; while there are five plays about the Water Margin. The stories in these plays differ significantly from the romances and storytelling versions. Guan Yu's "Single-Handedly Slaying Four Bandits," "Angrily Executing Guan Ping," Zhang Fei's "Apricot Grove Village," "Three Exits from Xiaopei," and Liu Bei's "Yellow Crane Tower" are all different from "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Tales of the Three Kingdoms." Lu Zhishen's "Yellow Flower Valley" and Li Kui's "Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation" are also completely different from "Water Margin."
    Generally speaking, plays with the same story produced after excellent romance novels are often greatly influenced by the romance novels. "The Three Kingdoms Standing Tall" in relation to "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The Righteous Knight Record," "The Precious Sword Record" in relation to "Water Margin," and "Heavenly Gate Formation," "Executing a Son at the Military Gate" in relation to "Generals of the Yang Family," are all examples of this relationship. However, there are also cases where the opposite is true. The aforementioned plays such as "Single-Handedly Slaying Four Bandits" may have been produced before the romance novels, influencing the romance novels. Therefore, exploring the origins and evolution of these related opera plays will help to understand and study how the corresponding romance novels draw materials from folk art and the complex process of typifying when creating characters and structuring stories.
    Many of the plays in "Rare Plays" not only have a role of carrying forward the past and opening up the future for romances and storytelling but also for various genres of drama in all eras. The so-called "carrying forward the past" means that they evolved from Song and Jin dynasty zaju plays or early Southern dramas; the so-called "opening up the future" means that they became the materials and embryos for later generations of various genres, such as chuanqi, Kunqu opera, Peking opera, and local opera plays. This is the role of "Rare Plays" in the history of opera play evolution. For example, many of the plays excavated by local operas in recent years have been influenced by "Rare Plays" or have evolved and been transplanted from the latter. Han Opera's "Qiao Mansion Seeks Advice" in relation to the first act of "Single Blade Meeting"; Henan Opera's "Han Xin Appointed General" in relation to "Secretly Crossing Chen Cang," "Zhong Wuyan" in relation to "Wisdom and Courage Pacify Qi"; Hunan Opera's "Thinking of the Secular World," Han Opera's "Double Descent from the Mountain" in relation to "Monk and Nun Commit a Crime Together"; Sichuan Opera's "Fish Basket Record," Hunan Opera's "Chasing the Fish" in relation to "Goddess of Mercy's Fish Basket Record"; Hebei Bangzi Opera's "North-South Combination," Shangdang Bangzi Opera's "Longevity Palace," "Heaven and Earth Belt" in relation to "Opening an Imperial Edict to Save Loyalty," and so on, all have a visible or invisible blood relationship. Therefore, "Rare Plays" can not only be used for academic research but can also be adapted and transplanted to become living property, active on the stage of socialist society, enriching the performance of our opera plays.

    阅读“孤本元明杂剧”
    曲六乙
    二十世纪三十年代，中国戏剧史上发生了一件大事：发现了也是园所藏元明杂剧。这批杂剧除却同其他本子重复的外，计有往昔不曾见到的剧目共一百三十八种。这不但使杂剧剧目骤增，丰富了元明杂剧文献，也为研究杂剧和杂剧发展史的人提供了可贵的资料。现在这批杂剧已经汇印成“孤本元明杂剧”（以下简称“孤本”），由中国戏剧出版社出版了。
    “孤本”中除有名家关汉卿、王实甫等所著的杂剧外，还辑有无名氏剧本一百零七种，占全集四分之三。这是其他藏本、印本所没有而“孤本”独具的特点。这些阙名的剧本，大都是未曾印刻过的手钞本；或为伶人所撰，或为伶人加工后的教坊流行本。它们在内容上俚俗质朴，生动感人；在形式上，宾白多，对话流畅，衬字多，歌唱流利。而从中我们也可以窥见三百年前流行于歌场上完本的真面貌。
    “孤本”的另一特点是，描写英雄人物的剧目最多。对于历史上的著名英雄如乐毅、张良、关羽、张飞、秦琼、岳飞等，都作了热情的歌颂和赞美。它们大多出于无名氏手笔。其中三国戏最多，有十七种；水浒戏则有五种。这些剧本故事，有不少与演义和评话相异。关羽的“单刀劈四寇”、“怒斩关平”，张飞的“杏林庄”、“三出小沛”，刘备的“黄鹤楼”，都不同于“三国志演义”和“三国志评话”。鲁智深的“黄花峪”，李逵的“九宫八卦阵”，也完全不同于“水浒”。
    一般来说，产生于优秀的演义小说之后的同一故事的剧本，往往受到演义的极大影响。“鼎峙春秋”之于“三国志演义”，“义侠记”、“宝剑记”之于“水浒”，“天门阵”、“辕门斩子”之于“杨家将演义”，都是这种关系。然而也有相反情况，前述“单刀劈四寇”等剧目，可能产生于演义小说之前，给演义小说以影响。因此，探讨这些有关的戏曲剧目的产生和衍变，将会有助于理解和研究相应的演义小说，如何从民间文艺中吸取素材，以及创造人物和结构故事时的典型化的复杂过程。
    “孤本”的许多剧目，不仅对于演义、评话，就是对于各时代的剧种，也具有承前启后、继往开来的作用。所谓“承前”，是指它们从宋金杂剧或早期南戏衍变而来；所谓“启后”，是指它们成为后代各剧种，如传奇、昆曲、京戏以及地方戏剧目的素材和胚胎。这就是“孤本”在戏曲剧目演变史中的作用。譬如近年来地方戏曲所发掘出的剧目中，就有不少是受到“孤本”的影响，或者是后者衍变和移植过来的。汉剧“乔府求计”之于“单刀会”第一折；豫剧“韩信拜帅”之于“暗渡陈仓”，“钟无艳”之于“智勇定齐”；湘剧“思凡”、汉剧“双下山”之于“僧尼共犯”；川剧“鱼篮记”、湘剧“追鱼”之于“观音菩萨鱼篮记”；河北梆子“南北合”、上党梆子“万寿宫”、“乾坤带”之于“开诏救忠”等等，都有着或显或隐的血缘关系。因此“孤本”不仅可供学者研究，也可以经过改编移植，成为活的财产，活跃在社会主义社会的舞台上，丰富我们戏曲剧目的演出。
