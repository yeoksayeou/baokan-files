Inside the Cultural Sphere

    Work Leap Forward, Thought Leap Forward
    At the symposium held by the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China from March 3rd to 5th, more than one hundred literary, musical, artistic, and theatrical workers enthusiastically put forward leap forward plans to create 10,000 pieces of various literary and artistic works this year. Writers put forward the resounding slogan of "One thousand works, guaranteed quality." Literary and art workers also put forward a thought leap forward plan. Literary critic and head of the Chinese Department of Nankai University, Li Helin, is striving to become a red and expert member of the working class intelligentsia within three years.
  
  Let Every Farmer See a Movie
    In accordance with the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the two hundred and twenty-nine rural film projection teams in Anhui Province have proposed that each projection team screen four hundred films this year, of which no less than 90% should be in rural areas. Assuming one thousand viewers per screening, the audience will reach ninety million, so that every farmer can see movies three to four times this year.
    
    People-Run Middle Schools, Study and Farm
    Seventy-eight people-run middle schools that combine study and production have emerged in the vast mountainous areas of Guizhou Province.
    Most of these middle schools were established successively in the autumn of last year. They did not use a penny of state funds. The funding is mainly maintained by the tuition fees paid by students. When there are shortages, some are raised by the community, and some are subsidized by local agricultural cooperatives from their public accumulation funds. The school buildings use local ancestral halls and other public houses, and the tables and benches are either borrowed or provided by the students themselves. Some of these schools study for half a day and work for half a day, while others work during the day and study at night, which is very popular among the masses.
    
    Peking Opera Also Has "The White Haired Girl"
    The China Peking Opera Theater in Beijing is adapting the script of "The White Haired Girl" and preparing to start rehearsals soon, striving to stage it in mid-April. This is the first bold attempt made by the China Peking Opera Theater in the reform of Peking Opera art, in accordance with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward.
    The roles for the Peking Opera "The White Haired Girl" have been determined: Du Jinfang will play Xi'er, Li Shaochun will play Yang Bailao, and Yuan Shihai will play Huang Shiren. The script adapters are Ma Shaobo and Fan Junhong, and the directors are A Jia and Zheng Yiqiu.

    文化圈内
    作品跃进　思想跃进
    在中共天津市委宣传部3日到5日召开的座谈会上，一百多个文学、音乐、美术、戏剧工作者热情地提出了跃进计划，今年要创作各种文艺作品一万件。作家们提出了“作品一千篇，保证质量”的响亮口号。文艺工作者还提出了思想跃进规划。文艺批评家、南开大学中文系主任李何林争取三年内成为又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
  让每个农民都看到电影
    根据农业生产大跃进的新形势，安徽省二百二十九个农村电影放映队提出每个放映队今年要放映四百场，其中农村场数不得少于90％。如以每场一千人计算，观众将达九千万人次，这样，每一个农民今年可以看到三次到四次电影。
    民办中学　边读边耕
    贵州省广大山区中已出现边读书边生产的民办中学七十八所。
    这些中学绝大部分是去年秋天先后创办起来的，它们没有用国家一文钱，经费主要由学生缴纳的学费来维持，不足时有的由社会集资，有的由当地农业社拿出一部分公积金来补助。校舍都是利用当地的祠堂等公共房屋，桌子、板凳也是借用或学生自备。这些学校有的是半天读书半天劳动，有的是白天劳动夜间读书，很受群众的欢迎。
    京剧也有“白毛女”
    北京中国京剧院正在改编“白毛女”剧本，准备在最近开始排练，争取在4月中上演。这是中国京剧院根据大跃进精神，在京剧艺术改革上所作的第一次大胆尝试。
    京剧“白毛女”的角色已经确定：杜近芳饰演喜儿，李少春饰演杨白劳，袁世海饰演黄世仁。剧本改编者是马少波、范钧宏，导演是阿甲、郑亦秋。
