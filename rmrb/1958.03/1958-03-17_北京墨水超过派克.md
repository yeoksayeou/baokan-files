    Beijing Ink Surpasses Parker
    The Beijing Ink Factory, a locally state-owned enterprise, has recently successfully trial-produced a high-grade blue-black ink. Test results prove that it has surpassed or reached the level of American "Parker" ink in various performance aspects.
    The color of this ink is brighter than Parker's, it writes more smoothly, and the writing does not fade after being immersed in water for twenty-four hours, and it remains a bright blue hue. When this ink is filled into a "51" type gold nib pen, it will not clog the pen even if writing is stopped for more than one hour. (Yan Shi)

    北京墨水超过派克
    地方国营北京市墨水厂最近试制成功一种高级蓝黑墨水。化验结果证明，在各种性能上已经分别超过或赶上美国“派克”墨水。
    这种墨水的颜色比派克鲜艳，书写比派克流利，字迹干后浸入水里二十四小时不褪色，而且仍是鲜蓝色头。这种墨水灌入51型金笔，在书写途中停笔一小时以上再写，仍不塞笔。　（严实）
