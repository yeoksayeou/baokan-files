Since the rectification movement, the Railway Ministry's Engineering Bureau has seen many big-character posters criticizing the bureau chief's leadership style, the most prominent being criticisms of the bureau chief's poor attitude towards lower-level staff. This is a noteworthy and fairly common problem.

In our society, leaders and the led are both revolutionary workers, both ordinary laborers, and in this respect, there is no difference between them. Their relationship is that of equal comrades, one ordinary laborer to another. Of course, leaders and the led have different positions, but this is only a necessary division of labor in revolutionary work. This division of labor creates a superior-subordinate relationship between them. This superior-subordinate relationship does not contradict their equal comradeship. Because our superior-subordinate relationship is fundamentally different from the superior-subordinate relationship in the old society, there is no unequal relationship of high and low, noble and mean between our superiors and subordinates. Unfortunately, the unequal relationships between superiors and subordinates left over from the old society still exist to varying degrees in some units. In this rectification movement to overthrow bureaucratic airs, a major cleanup is underway to eliminate these remaining unequal phenomena.

The big-character posters of the Railway Ministry's Engineering Bureau staff criticized the bureau chief for having a relatively rigid attitude, not patiently listening to the opinions of lower-level cadres, and having little contact with lower-level cadres. Critics hoped that the bureau chief would be more friendly to subordinates and often visit various sections to talk to everyone. The big-character posters also criticized the bureau chief for often expressing his own opinions before hearing the full report, and critics asked the bureau chief to "calmly listen to the opinions and speeches of the reporter more and express his own opinions later." People may say that these are not big deals. However, we want to ask: What is it that destroys the equal comrade-like relationship that should exist between our superiors and subordinates? Isn't it precisely this hateful bureaucratic air? Can it be said that this is a trivial matter not worth paying attention to?

A leader is originally also an ordinary laborer. However, because he holds a leadership position, this identity of the leader often overshadows his identity as an ordinary laborer, making him appear special among the masses. Comrades who hold leadership positions may wish to consider, when you are in contact with lower-level cadres, do you pay attention to not letting your identity as a leader overshadow your identity as an ordinary laborer? Are you consciously aware that your relationship with him is completely equal?

The situation in the Engineering Bureau is not very isolated. Some leaders who are divorced from the masses have cold faces in front of their subordinates, rarely showing a smile; they rarely meet with their subordinates except for meetings and task assignments; they are very distant from each other, and no one knows each other very well, and no one can grasp what the other is thinking. What makes subordinates particularly dissatisfied is that they do not patiently listen to the opinions of lower-level cadres: if the speech is a bit long-winded, they become impatient and even stop others from speaking; if the opinions of subordinates are inconsistent with those of the leaders, they will immediately be rejected, and may even be criticized as a result. This situation is a constraint on the enthusiasm and creativity of lower-level cadres. As a result, some people dare not speak their minds freely in front of their superiors, and even "leave half of what they want to say at the tip of their tongue." Leaders also become deaf and blind as a result, and are prone to subjective and one-sided errors. This phenomenon is not in line with the nature of the socialist ownership of production relations, and it is an obstacle to the development of our various undertakings. In the rectification movement, this phenomenon cannot but be severely criticized by the masses. Especially after the new situation of a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the various undertakings that come with it has emerged, this phenomenon is even more intolerable to the people.

Since the rectification movement, especially after the upsurge against waste and conservatism, much of the bureaucratic air has been eliminated. Many comrades who have been tainted with bureaucratic air are working hard to sweep away the dust from themselves. The bureau chief of the Railway Ministry's Engineering Bureau who was criticized has now made significant improvements. His attitude towards his subordinates is not so rigid, he has begun to patiently listen to the opinions of his comrades, and he also tries to find more opportunities to contact his comrades. However, generally speaking, this improvement is still not very solid, and some have improved better, some have improved worse, and some leading comrades, although they are also striving to improve, still lack a deep understanding of the reasons for this situation. Therefore, it is still very necessary to draw lessons from the struggle to eliminate bureaucratic air.

Among our leading comrades, there are very few who are tainted with the Kuomintang style and consciously put on airs of officials to suppress people with their power. Most leaders who are divorced from the masses have bureaucratic air, but they do not intentionally put on airs of officials. Even, when their subordinates have not criticized their bureaucratic air, they have not thought that they have so much bureaucratic air at all. So, where does this bureaucratic air come from?

Some leaders, although they do not think that they are more special or noble than their lower-level cadres, always think that they are more clever and correct than their lower-level cadres. If this were not the case, why would they not be interested in the opinions of their lower-level cadres, and even be unwilling to patiently listen to their reports? If this were not the case, why would they dislike hearing different opinions so much? It cannot be denied that the level of leading cadres is higher than that of lower-level cadres. However, this alone is far from enough to do a good job in leadership. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of our Party, played a great helmsman role in our revolutionary cause and enjoyed high prestige among the whole Party and the people of the whole country is not only because he is good at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, but also because he firmly trusts the strength and wisdom of the masses, advocates the mass line in the work of the Party, and adheres to the Party's democratic principles and the principle of collective leadership." It can be seen that whether or not a leader firmly trusts the strength and wisdom of the masses is one of the main signs of whether a leader is mature. Those leaders who think that they are always more clever than others precisely neglect this point, deviate from the Party's mass line, and fall into the quagmire of subjective arbitrariness.

Different opinions, resolved through debate, are the best way to lead. A mature leader is never afraid of having different opinions when discussing issues, but is afraid of not establishing an opposing side and allowing the contradictions of things to be hidden. Concealing contradictions and being afraid of debate are the subjective and dogmatic leaders who do not understand dialectics. Correct things are never afraid of fighting against incorrect things. Through struggle, correct things can become more substantial and complete. Moreover, the opinions of leaders are not always correct, and especially will not always be very comprehensive and complete. If you do not listen to different opinions, you run the risk of making mistakes.

Some leaders like to use the simple method of issuing orders and instructions to treat their subordinates. Even when they seek opinions, they often just ask a simple question, making it inconvenient for people to talk more. Orders and instructions are indispensable. However, in general, that should be the collective decision of the organization. When a leader talks to lower-level cadres about work, he should try to avoid the tone of instructions and orders, otherwise, the other party will feel that you are the superior and he is the subordinate, and the conversation will easily be constrained. It is best to exchange ideas frankly and without restraint like comrades of the same level, you tell him your views, he tells you his opinions, supplementing each other and arguing with each other, so that everyone's views gradually approach. In this way, lower-level cadres will feel that this is a comrade-like discussion of issues, and will not feel that there is any inequality or boundary between the two sides. However, why are some leaders only accustomed to discussing issues so freely among cadres of the same level, but not accustomed to discussing them with lower-level cadres? This is a question worth pondering.

It should also be said that the attitude towards subordinates is rude and even loses temper. Some comrades disagree with saying that this is bureaucratic air, that this is treating lower-level cadres with an unequal attitude. They always say that it is because of a bad temper. This statement is difficult to justify. How many comrades who are accustomed to losing their temper with their subordinates also treat their superiors with the same rude attitude? I'm afraid not many. In fact, whether consciously or unconsciously, these comrades always think that I am your superior, you are led by me, and it does not matter if I lose my temper with you. Can this be said to be an equal attitude? Superiors should have strict requirements for their subordinates and should promptly criticize their shortcomings and mistakes. However, this is different from losing one's temper. Serious criticism can make people clear-headed and improve their understanding; losing one's temper can only make people feel embarrassed and unequal.

Increasing contact between superiors and subordinates is very helpful in increasing understanding and eliminating estrangement. Certain special circumstances of leadership work make it impossible for contact between superiors and subordinates to be exactly the same as that between cadres of the same level. Lower-level cadres should be considerate of this and should not demand that everyone be absolutely the same; however, leaders must never think that they can be special because of this. It is up to people to make things happen. As long as you truly feel that it is necessary, you can think of many ways. Since the rectification movement, the situation in this regard has greatly improved. For example, leading cadres participate in physical labor, work with everyone to eliminate the four pests and clean up, and write big-character posters with everyone during the great blooming and contending..., some comrades have made great determination in this regard. The leading cadres of Ping'an Mine of Fuxin Coal Mine have recently moved to live in workers' dormitories, which is a good way to be promoted. There are many ways to increase contact and enhance the friendly relationship between superiors and subordinates. The key is that leading cadres should truly appear as ordinary laborers when they are with everyone, and discuss issues with everyone frankly. Only in this way will lower-level cadres hand over their hearts to you and treat you as a close, respected and trusted friend, and be willing to pour out to you what they are unwilling to say in front of others. Otherwise, all good methods will degenerate into formalism, and even frequent contact will be in name only.

### 以普通劳动者的姿态出现

    以普通劳动者的姿态出现
    铁道部工务局自整风运动以来，曾经出现许多批评局长领导作风的大字报，其中最突出的是批评局长对待下级工作人员的态度不好。这是值得注意的相当普遍的问题。
    在我们的社会里，领导者和被领导者同是革命工作人员，同是普通的劳动者，在这一点上大家没有任何不同。他们的关系也就是这一个普通劳动者和那一个普通劳动者之间的平等的同志关系。当然，领导者和被领导者职位不同，但是，这只是革命工作中必要的分工。这种分工使他们之间有着上下级的关系。这种上下级关系和他们的平等的同志关系并不矛盾。因为，我们的上下级关系和旧社会的上下级关系根本不同，在我们的上下级之间没有任何尊卑贵贱的不平等关系。可惜，旧社会遗留下来的上下级之间的不平等关系，在某些单位仍然程度不同地存在着。在这次打倒官气的整风运动中，对这种残留下来的不平等现象，正在进行着一次大扫除。
    铁道部工务局工作人员的大字报中批评局长态度比较生硬，不耐心听取下级干部意见，和下级干部接触较少。批评者希望局长对下级态度要和气些，还要常到各科走走，找大家谈谈。大字报还批评局长听汇报常常不听完就发表自己的意见，批评者要求局长“冷静地多听汇报人的意见和发言，晚点发表自己的意见。”人们也许会说，这些都不是什么大事。可是，我们要问：破坏我们上下级之间应有的平等的同志式关系的是什么东西呢？难道不正是这种讨厌的官气吗？能说这是不值得注意的小事吗？
    领导者，本来也是一个普通的劳动者。可是，因为他担任着领导职务，这种领导者的身份就常常掩盖了他普通劳动者的身份，使他们在群众中显得特殊起来。担任领导工作的同志不妨考虑一下，当你和下级干部接触的时候，是不是注意到不要使自己领导者的身份掩盖了普通劳动者的身份？是不是有意识地感到你和他的关系是完全平等的？
    像工务局这样的情况，并不是很个别的。某些脱离群众的领导者，在下级面前面孔冷冷的，难见一丝笑容；除了开会、布置任务，很少和下级见面；彼此之间很疏远，谁也不大了解谁，谁也摸不着谁的心。特别使下级不满意的是他们不耐心听取下级干部的意见：话说得噜囌一点了，就不耐烦，甚至制止别人发言；下级的意见和领导者不一致，立即就会被顶回去，甚至还会因此受到批评。这种情况，对下级干部的积极性和创造性是一种束缚。有些人因此在上级面前不敢畅所欲言，甚至“话到口边留半句”。领导者也因此变得耳目蔽塞，容易发生主观片面性的错误。这种现象同我们社会主义所有制的生产关系的性质是不相符合的，它是我们的各项事业发展的障碍。在整风运动中，这种现象不能不受到群众的严厉批评。特别是当工农业生产以及随之而来的各种事业全面大跃进的新形势出现以后，这种现象就更为人们所不能容忍。
    整风运动以来，特别是反浪费反保守的高潮出现以后，官气已被打掉不少。许多沾染上官气的同志正在努力从自己身上扫除灰尘。铁道部工务局那位受到批评的局长现在已经有了显著的改进，对下级的态度不那么生硬了，开始耐心地听取同志们的意见了，同时也尽可能多找机会和同志们接触。可是，就一般情况看，这种改进毕竟还是不很巩固的，而且，有的改得好些，有的改得差些，有些领导同志虽然也在力求改进，对于造成这种情况的原因却还缺少深刻的认识。因此，从扫除官气的斗争中吸取经验教训，仍然是十分必要的。
    在我们的领导同志中，沾染了国民党作风，有意识地摆官架子以势压人的，当然极少。多数脱离群众的领导者虽有官气，可并不是有意要摆官架子，甚至，在下级没有对他们的官气提出批评的时候，他们根本没有想到自己有那么大的官气。那么，这种官气究竟从何而来呢？
    有些领导者虽然并不觉得自己比下级干部特殊或者尊贵，可是总以为自己比下级高明、正确。如果不是这样，为什么对于下级的意见那么不感兴趣，甚至连下级汇报情况都不愿耐心听完？如果不是这样，为什么那么不喜欢听不同的意见？不能否认，领导干部的水平要比下级干部高。可是，仅仅凭这一点，远不能做好领导工作。刘少奇同志在党的第八次代表大会的报告中说：“我们党的领袖毛泽东同志所以在我们的革命事业中起了伟大的舵手作用，所以在全党和全国人民中享有崇高的威信，不但是因为他善于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，而且是因为他坚决地信任群众的力量和智慧，倡导党的工作中的群众路线，坚持党的民主原则和集体领导原则。”可见，是不是坚决地信任群众的力量和智慧，正是一个领导者是否成熟的主要标志之一。那些自以为总比别人高明的领导者恰恰忽略了这一点，脱离了党的群众路线，陷于主观武断的泥坑中去了。
    不同的意见，经过争辩求得解决，是最好的领导方法。一个成熟的领导者，决不害怕讨论问题时有不同意见，害怕的是树立不起对立面，让事物的矛盾被隐蔽起来。掩盖矛盾，害怕争论的是不懂辩证法的主观主义的领导者。正确的东西决不害怕同不正确的东西进行斗争，经过斗争，正确的才能变得更充实更完整。而且，领导者的意见也并不永远都是正确的，尤其不会都是十分全面十分完整的。不听不同的意见，就有犯错误的危险。
    有些领导者喜欢用下命令和发指示这种简便的办法去对待下级，就是征求意见，也常常只是简单的问一声，使人不便多谈。命令和指示是少不了的。但是，一般说，那应该是组织的集体的决定。领导者个人和下级干部谈工作，应该尽量避免指示和命令的口气，否则，对方就会感到你是上级他是下级，谈话就容易受到束缚。最好是像同级的同志在一起一样，毫无拘束地推心置腹地交流思想，你把你的看法告诉他，他把他的意见告诉你，互相补充、互相辩驳，使大家的看法渐渐接近。这样，下级干部就会感到这是同志间的研究问题，就不会觉得双方之间有什么不平等和界限。可是，为什么有些领导者只习惯于在同级干部中这样自由地商讨问题，而不习惯同下级干部一起商讨呢？这是值得深思的问题。
    还应该说一说对下级的态度粗暴以至随便发脾气的问题。说这是官气，这是用不平等的态度对待下级干部，有些同志是不同意的，他们总说是因为脾气不好。这说法是很难站得住的。习惯对下级发脾气的同志，有多少也用同样粗暴的态度对待他的上级呢？恐怕不多吧。实际上不管自觉不自觉，这些同志总是以为我是你的上级，你是被我领导的，我对你发发脾气没有什么关系。这能够说是平等的态度吗？上级对下级应该有严格的要求，应该及时地批评他们的缺点和错误。但是，这和发脾气是两回事。严肃的批评可以使人头脑清醒提高认识；发脾气却只能使人感到难堪和不平等。
    增加上下级之间的接触，对于增加了解消除隔阂很有好处。领导工作的某些特殊情况，使上下级之间的接触不可能和同级干部之间完全一样。下级干部应该体谅到这一点，不要要求大家绝对一样；领导者却决不要因此就觉得自己可以特殊。事在人为，只要真正感到有必要，就可以想出很多办法。整风运动以来，这方面的情况就有了很大的改进。比如，领导干部参加体力劳动，和大家一起除四害大扫除，在大鸣大放中和大家一块写大字报……，有些同志在这方面已经下了很大的决心，阜新煤矿平安矿的领导干部，最近都搬到工人宿舍去住，就是很值得提倡的好办法。增加接触、增进上下级之间友谊关系的办法很多，关键还在于领导干部和大家在一起的时候真正是以普通劳动者的身份出现，是和大家推心置腹地商量问题。只有这样，下级干部才会把心交给你，把你当成亲密而又值得尊敬和信任的朋友，在别人面前不愿讲的话却愿意向你倾吐。否则，一切好办法都会流于形式主义，即使经常接触也是貌合神离。
