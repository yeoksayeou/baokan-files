My Suggestions

	Manage Surplus Furniture
	One million three hundred thousand cadres nationwide have been sent down to the countryside and grassroots units. After the cadres were sent down, much equipment, furniture, office supplies, and other items became idle. In many offices and dormitories, corridors, courtyards, and warehouses are filled with desks and chairs. It is suggested that the relevant departments quickly manage it and allocate it for unified use.

	Prepare Well for Going Down
	In order to save national expenditures, hire fewer workers, and prepare for labor training for the future going down, we have implemented a voluntary water-carrying system in our organization. Whenever there is free time after work, comrades rush to carry water.
	At present, due to the needs of work, it is impossible for every cadre to go down at the same time. I believe that cadres who remain in the organization or school should engage in appropriate and regular voluntary labor, which is also a very good form of training. It can not only save the country money and create wealth, but also train oneself and lay a good foundation for future going down, which is truly a win-win situation.

	Study Materials Should Be Purchased by Oneself
	There is still a large sum of study funds in the organization, specifically for cadres' political study to buy books. Now that school students pay their own expenses, can't the cadres of the organization afford to buy their own study materials? Political study is for transforming and improving one's own thinking. The state provides a certain amount of work time as political study time, which can already be said to be extremely caring. Therefore, I believe that our cadres should spend their own money to buy all the documents used for study, so that the state can use this study fee for the most needed production and construction!

    我的建议
    把多余的家具管起来
    全国已有一百三十万干部下放到农村和基层单位。干部下放后，许多器材、家具、办公用品等物都闲置下来。许多机关、宿舍里的走廊里、院子里、仓库里到处堆放着桌椅板凳。建议各主管部门赶快把它管理起来，统一调配使用。

    为下放作好准备
    为了节约国家开支，少请工人，并为将来下放作好劳动锻炼的准备，在我们机关里实行了义务挑水制。每当工余之暇，同志们都争先恐后地去挑水。
    目前，由于工作的需要，不可能每个干部都同时下放，我认为留在机关或学校里的干部，进行适当的和经常性的义务劳动，这也是一种很好的锻炼。不仅能为国家节省资金，创造财富，而且还能锻炼自己，为以后的下放打好基础，作好准备，这真是两全其美。

    学习文件应该自购
    机关内还有很大一笔学习费，专门为干部的政治学习买书用的。现在学校学生尚且自费，难道机关干部自己买不起学习文件吗？政治学习是为的改造和提高自己的思想，国家给予一定的工作时间作为政治学习时间，已经可以说是极大的关怀。因此我认为我们机关干部应该自己花钱买一切学习用的文件，让国家把这一笔学习费用到最需要的生产建设上去吧！
