Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 18th: The symposium on people-run agricultural middle schools convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee began in Nanjing on the 17th. In addition to exchanging experiences, this symposium will study some new issues in agricultural middle schools and initially formulate plans to promote the great development of people-run agricultural middle schools and a great leap forward in education. More than 100 people attended the symposium. Lu Dingyi, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Propaganda Department, and Liu Shi, Vice Minister of Education, attended the symposium. Responsible persons from relevant agencies in Beijing, Shanghai, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces and cities were also invited to participate.

At the symposium on the 17th, everyone talked about the great significance of developing people-run agricultural middle schools. In the great leap forward in agricultural production, the vast number of farmers in the province urgently demanded to improve their culture and popularize agricultural scientific knowledge. People-run agricultural middle schools were born under this situation. Now, some people-run agricultural middle schools have already started classes, some are preparing to start, and many places are actively preparing.

Shuai Xihong, Secretary of the Shuanglou Township Party Committee in Hai'an County, introduced at the meeting the process of starting an agricultural middle school from scratch in four days. The school was prepared from the 4th and opened on the 8th. More than 85% of the more than two hundred senior primary school graduates in the township signed up. Senior primary school graduates from this township who were studying outside and graduates from neighboring townships also signed up. Each student is guaranteed to study 150 days a year, and attendance should not be less than one-half of normal labor force, and good students should reach two-thirds. One student gets up in the morning to work as a teacher in a people's school, studies at the agricultural middle school in the morning, works in the afternoon, and records work points as an accountant in the production team in the evening. He proposed that learning, literacy, production, and work should not be neglected, and he should strive to earn 1,000 work points in a year. Teachers and students of this school plant experimental fields together, practicing teaching while studying, and working while studying. The school currently has three classes. At the beginning of the school year, the public only spent a few cents on chalk. The rest was self-funded and self-managed by the masses, without spending a penny of state money. After the school started, some young farmers listened in the classroom and all developed a love for this school.

Zhang Ao, Minister of Culture and Education of the Hanjiang County Party Committee, said: After the establishment of the two agricultural middle schools in Shiqiao Township, the masses reflected that there were eight major benefits: First, the masses ran the schools themselves, saving state expenditure; second, it was conducive to the development of local production; third, senior primary school graduates could continue their studies; fourth, rural youths could settle down to rural production; fifth, part-time farming and part-time study allowed people with economic difficulties to attend school; sixth, teaching linked to practice could train cadres for agricultural cooperatives; seventh, when students learn political current events, they can be propagandists in the countryside; and eighth, they strengthened rural literacy efforts. The establishment of the two agricultural middle schools in this township has been consistently implemented the mass line from beginning to end. The school system, curriculum, and funding were all jointly studied and resolved by the Party Committee, the School Committee, the agricultural cooperatives, and student parents. After three years of study, students' Chinese and mathematics are basically equivalent to the level of ordinary junior high school graduates, their political level reaches the level of ordinary propagandists, and they master the necessary production knowledge. After the school enrollment list is released, students who are not admitted are allowed to attend classes in the school, and those with good grades can be transferred to formal students later.

Huangfu Yin, a "New Farmer" from the Five-Star Cooperative in Yugou Township, Huaiyin County, talked about the Five-Star Agricultural Middle School established with the assistance of cadres sent to lower levels. Since the school opened more than two months ago, the labor production of the cadres sent to lower levels has not only not been delayed, but also strengthened their ties with the masses. They teach and learn at the same time, learn production from students and farmer students in the fields, and listen to students' opinions and visit student parents in teaching at any time, hold student seminars, collect feedback, and improve teaching. Because they adopted the policy of mass self-management, part-time farming and part-time study, running schools diligently and thriftily, and serving production, they have been widely welcomed by local youths, student parents, and cadres.

The meeting will continue to discuss the experience of running agricultural middle schools in these areas.

    交流经验　制订规划
    促进民办农业中学大发展
    江苏省委召开座谈会
    新华社南京18日电　中共江苏省委召开的民办农业中学座谈会，17日在南京开始举行。这次座谈会除交流经验外，将研究农业中学中一些新的问题，初步制订规划，以促进民办农业中学的大发展和教育事业的大跃进。参加座谈会的共一百多人。中共中央政治局候补委员、宣传部长陆定一，教育部副部长柳湜都出席了座谈会。北京、上海、福建、江西、山东、浙江、安徽等省、市的有关机关的负责人也应邀参加。
    在17日的座谈会上，大家都谈到了发展民办农业中学的重大意义。在农业生产大跃进中，全省广大农民迫切要求提高文化、普及农业科学知识，民办农业中学就是在这种形势下诞生的。现在，一些民办农业中学有的已经上课，有的正在开学，有很多地方都在积极筹办。
    海安县双楼乡党委书记帅锡宏，在会上介绍了这个乡白手起家、四天办起一所农业中学的经过。学校从4日筹备，8日开学。全乡二百多高小毕业生，报名的达85％，本乡在外面补习的高小毕业生、邻乡毕业生也有来报名的。每个学生保证每年学习一百五十天，出勤不少于正常劳动力的二分之一，好的要达到三分之二。有一个学生，早晨起来当民校教师，上午到农业中学学习，下午劳动，晚上在生产队记工分当会计。他提出学习、扫盲、生产、工作四不误，一年要争取做一千个工分。这个学校教师和学生一齐种试验田，实行边教边读，半耕半读。学校现有三个班，开学时公家只花了几角钱买粉笔，其余都是群众自筹自办，没有花国家一个钱。学校开学上课后，有些青年农民到课堂旁听，都对这所学校发生了热爱。
    邗江县委文教部长张翺说：施桥乡的两所农业中学创办起来后，群众反映有八大好处：一是群众自办，节约了国家的开支；二是对发展当地生产有利；三是高小毕业生可以继续升学；四是使农村青年可以安心农村生产；五是半耕半读，经济困难的人也可上学；六是教学联系实际可以为农业社培养干部；七是学生们学政治时事，可在农村当宣传员；八是加强了农村扫盲力量。这个乡的两所农业中学的创办，自始至终贯彻了群众路线，学制、课程、经费等都由党委会、校委会、农业社和学生家长等有关方面共同研究解决。学生通过三年学习，语文、数学基本上相当于一般初中毕业生水平，在政治上达到一般宣传员的水平，并掌握必要的生产知识。学校招生发榜后，准许未被录取的学生到校随班旁听，以后成绩好的可以转为正式学生。
    淮阴县渔沟乡五星社“新农民”皇甫垠谈到了下放干部协助当地创办的五星农业中学。学校开办两个多月以来，下放干部的劳动生产不但没有耽误，并且加强了同群众的联系。他们边教边学，在田里向学生和农民学生产，教学中也随时听取学生意见，访问学生家长，开学生座谈会，收集反映，改进教学。由于他们采取了群众自办、半耕半读、勤俭办校和为生产服务的方针，受到了当地青年、学生家长、干部的普遍欢迎。
    会议将继续就这些地区办农业中学的经验进行讨论。
