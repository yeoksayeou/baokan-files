Title: The Nation Accumulates Over 140 Billion Dan of Fertilizer; Average Fertilizer Accumulation Exceeds 8,000 Jin Per Mu; Don't Count by Cartloads, Don't Count by Piles, Fertilizer is Measured in Inches; Red Soil Slopes and Yellow Soil Slopes All Transformed into Black Soil Slopes

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: This year, the national average accumulation of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land has reached 8,500 jin, providing a reliable guarantee for realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production.

Since last winter, the fertilizer accumulation campaign, launched simultaneously with water conservancy construction in rural areas across the country, has been vigorous and large-scale. Farmers in various regions have sought out more than 100 kinds of fertilizer sources from all directions—rural areas, cities, mountains, underground, rivers, lakes, and seas—and have created many fertilizer production methods. Their enthusiasm has grown, so fertilizer accumulation plans in various places have been repeatedly exceeded. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture up to March 18, the nation's rural areas have accumulated 140.3 billion dan of fertilizer. Averaged per mu of cultivated land, this represents an increase of 4.5 times compared to the total fertilizer application in 1952, an increase of 2.4 times compared to the total fertilizer application in 1956, and also a significant increase compared to last year. In Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hunan provinces, where the fertilizer accumulation campaign has progressed more rapidly, the current average accumulation of natural fertilizer per mu of cultivated land has exceeded 20,000 jin. Hubei, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces and autonomous regions have all reached 10,000 jin. In Andong and Xinbin counties, Liaoning Province, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of cultivated land can no longer be calculated by cartloads or piles. Many cultivated lands are covered with a two- or three-inch-thick layer of manure, turning them black, hence the emergence of this new folk song: "Don't count by cartloads, don't count by piles, fertilizer is measured in inches; red soil slopes and yellow soil slopes all transformed into black soil slopes."

The quality of fertilizer accumulation in various regions has also improved. This is the result of the significant development of pig production in rural areas and the widespread promotion of "every person has a toilet, every pig has a pen." According to key inspection materials in Hubei Province, it is estimated that high-quality fertilizer accounts for about 60%, average-quality fertilizer accounts for about 30%, and relatively poor-quality fertilizer accounts for only about 10% of the accumulated fertilizer. In Shandong Province, pen manure accounts for 40% of the accumulated fertilizer. In Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, pen manure, stable manure, and other fertilizers account for 75% of the accumulated fertilizer. In Zhuanglang and Gangu counties, Gansu Province, medium and high-quality fertilizers account for more than 80%, basically eliminating the phenomenon of "moving yellow soil" and neglecting quality in fertilizer accumulation.

In order to ensure that large quantities of manure are delivered to the fields, many regions have mobilized farmers to accumulate and transport fertilizer simultaneously, and to top-dress winter crops. They have also created many kinds of fertilizer accumulation and transportation tools, so the time for delivering manure is generally earlier than in previous years, and the delivery is also faster. In Heilongjiang Province, fertilizer transportation work started two months earlier than in the past, and 75% of the manure has already been delivered to the fields. Gansu Province has basically completed the delivery. Hebei Province has delivered more than half. In many counties in Hubei Province, mechanization has been achieved, greatly improving the efficiency of fertilizer transportation.

However, according to inspections, the progress of the fertilizer accumulation and delivery work is uneven. Some counties and some townships and communes have accumulated less and delivered slower; some townships and communes only focus on increasing the quantity of fertilizer accumulation in a concentrated manner and neglect the quality; and some townships and communes have falsely reported fertilizer accumulation achievements. These problems have already attracted the attention of local leading organs and are being addressed. Currently, various regions are leading agricultural cooperatives to rationally arrange labor and farm work, promote improved tools, and vigorously transport manure, striving to deliver all the manure to the fields in a timely manner before spring plowing.

### 全国积肥一千四百多亿担  平均每亩积肥八千多斤  车不论　堆不论　施肥论几寸  红土坡黄土坡一律变黑坡

    全国积肥一千四百多亿担
    平均每亩积肥八千多斤
    车不论　堆不论　施肥论几寸
    红土坡黄土坡一律变黑坡
    新华社22日讯　今年全国平均每亩耕地已经积有肥料八千五百斤，为实现农业生产大跃进提供了可靠保证。
    从去年冬季开始，在全国农村中和兴修水利同时展开的积肥运动，来势很猛，规模很大。各地农民从农村、城市、山上、地下、江、河、湖、海等四面八方找寻出一百多种肥源，创造了许多造肥方法，干劲越来越高，因此各地积肥计划一再被突破。据农业部到3月18日止的统计，全国农村已经积肥一千四百零三亿担，按每亩耕地平均，比1952年全年施肥量增加四点五倍，比1956年全年施肥量增加二点四倍，比去年也增加了很多。积肥运动进展较快的江苏、安徽、湖南三省，目前平均每亩耕地已积有自然肥料两万多斤。湖北、四川、江西、广东、广西等五个省和自治区都达到了万斤。辽宁省安东、新宾等县每亩耕地施的肥料已经无法按车按堆计算，许多耕地被两三寸厚的粪肥盖得乌黑一片，因此出现了这样的新歌谣：“车不论，堆不论，施肥论几寸；红土坡，黄土坡，一律变黑坡。”
    各地的积肥质量也有提高。这是农村生猪生产有了很大发展和广泛倡行“人有厕所猪有圈”的结果。湖北省据重点检查的材料估算，积的肥料中质量高的占60％左右，质量一般的占30％左右，质量较差的只占10％左右。山东省积的肥料中，圈肥占40％；河北省沧县专区积的肥料中，圈肥、厩肥等占75％。甘肃省庄浪、甘谷等县上中等肥料占80％以上，基本上消灭了积肥中“黄土搬家”不注意质量的现象。
    为了保证把大量的粪肥送到地里，很多地区发动农民边积、边送和给越冬作物追肥，并且创造了很多种积肥运肥工具，因此送粪时间普遍比往年提早，送的也快。黑龙江省运送肥料的工作比以往提早了两个月，目前75％的粪肥已经送到地里。甘肃省已经基本送完。河北省送出了一半以上。湖北省很多县实现了车子化，运送肥料的效率大大提高。
    但是据检查，积肥运动和送肥工作的进展是不平衡的。有的县和有些乡、社积的少，送的也慢；有些乡、社只顾突击积肥数量，忽视了质量；还有的乡、社有假报积肥成绩的现象。这些问题，已经引起各地领导机关注意，正在加以解决。目前各地都在领导农业社合理安排劳力和农活，推广改良工具，大力运送粪肥，力争在春耕前适时地把粪肥全部送到地里。
