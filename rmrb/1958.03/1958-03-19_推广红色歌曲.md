Promoting red songs in the midst of criticizing yellow songs is a matter of great positive significance.

The Liaoning People's Publishing House has done a very good job in this regard. They have published nearly twenty kinds of small song sheets, each with a circulation of 100,000 to 200,000 copies, and they are still in short supply and are welcomed by the broad masses.

These small song sheets are printed on beautiful card stock and folded in half to be only as big as a regular small notebook, making them very convenient to use. It has a beautiful color cover, and inside are two or three songs loved by the masses. The selection of songs is very broad, including not only excellent original songs reflecting socialist construction, but also some folk songs, ancient tunes, and selections from operas and traditional operas. You can choose your favorite songs here for just a few cents. These small song sheets are truly a light cavalry team for promoting red songs and resisting yellow songs.

After rectification and anti-rightist struggles, the music scene has seen many new developments this year. I believe the publication of these small song sheets is one of these new developments. Although this is not a great invention, it embodies the revolutionary spirit of some comrades who dare to break with convention and promote work. In the past, we had some song collections and journals. Composers wrote them, and editors edited them, and that was considered completing the task. As for what role these works actually played in the lives of the masses and which works the masses liked the most, it often did not attract everyone's attention. Sometimes, readers had to run all over the bookstores to find one or two songs, or if they found them, they had to buy a whole book. Now, there have been great improvements in these areas, which shows that everyone has a better understanding of the policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Of course, these small song sheets can be improved even further. For example, consider how to reflect current political life and make them more militant; whether the price can be further reduced (the current price is four cents per copy), or consider publishing an economical version suitable for rural areas; in addition, some of the covers are designed dimly, and some have unclear meanings, which seem to be further improved.

There are many ways to promote red songs. I hope that all localities can give play to creativity and create more new forms. (Attached picture)

    推广红色歌曲
    孙丙
    在批判黄色歌曲声中，怎样来更好地推广红色歌曲，是很有积极意义的事。
    辽宁人民出版社在这方面做了很好的工作。他们出版的小歌片已近二十种，每种都发行了十万到二十多万份，而且还供不应求，受到广大群众的欢迎。
    这种小歌片，用精美的卡片纸印刷，对折起来只有普通小笔记本一样大，用起来非常方便。它有一个漂亮的彩色封面，里面便是两三首群众所喜爱的歌曲。歌曲的选材很广，除了创作的反映社会主义建设生活的优秀歌曲以外，还包括一些民歌、古曲、歌剧和戏曲的选曲等。你只要花上几分钱，就可以在这里选到你最爱好的歌曲。这种小歌片，真是一支推广红色歌曲、抵制黄色歌曲的轻骑队。
    经过整风和反右，今年音乐界出现很多新气象，我以为这种小歌片的出版也是这种新气象之一。这虽然不是什么伟大的发明，但却体现了一些同志们勇于打破常规、促进工作的革命精神。我们过去有一些歌集和期刊，作曲家写出来了，编辑编出来了，就算完成任务；至于这些作品在群众生活中究竟起了什么作用和群众最喜欢哪些作品，常常引不起大家的重视。甚至有时有的读者为了一两首歌跑遍书店也找不到，或者找到了不得不买一整本。现在这些方面的工作都有了很大的改进，这说明了大家对为工农兵服务的方针有了更进一步的领会。
    自然，这小歌片还可改进得更完美些。比如，考虑如何反映当前的政治生活，使它更有战斗性；定价是否可再降低一些（现定价每份四分），或考虑出一种适于农村的经济版；此外，有些封面设计得暗晦了些，也有的寓意不明，似乎也可作进一步的改善。
    推广红色歌曲，办法是很多的。盼望各地方能够发挥创造性，创造出更多的新形式。（附图片）
