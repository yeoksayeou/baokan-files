    The Pioneer Cooperative's Great Debate Refutes the "Difficulty Theory": Skillful Arrangements Turn Labor Shortage into Surplus
    (Our dispatch) Reporter Zhan Chao reports: After a mass-based great airing of views, great blooming, and great debate, the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative in Qinxian County, Shanxi Province, proposed eleven effective measures to solve the labor shortage encountered during the great leap forward in production.
    The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative is a small cooperative in Dongzhuang, Cicun Township, Qinxian County. The cooperative has 72 households, with only 115 full and semi-able-bodied men and women. In reality, only more than 40 men and women are regularly engaged in field work, and they cultivate an average of 25 mu of land each. Due to the labor shortage, more than 100 mu of land were not sown in time last year, more than 1,000 dan of fertilizer were not delivered to the fields after the spring sowing, 30 mu of soybean fields were not weeded at all, and the autumn crops were only hoed an average of two times. This affected the harvest.
    When the great leap forward in production was proposed, with the goal of producing an average of 400 jin of grain per mu this year, the cooperative members were excited, but also worried, saying: "Who wouldn't want to produce more grain? But gathering and applying more fertilizer requires manpower! Digging wells and opening canals for irrigation requires manpower! Intensive cultivation requires manpower! In short, what to do about the labor shortage?" Indeed, according to the cooperative's plan for developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production this year, a total of 29,800 workdays were needed. If each male laborer averages 300 workdays and each female laborer averages 100 workdays, the cooperative can only achieve 23,300 workdays, 6,500 workdays short of what is needed.
    Faced with this difficulty, the Pioneer Cooperative's Party branch and management committee had considered abandoning 140 mu of cultivated land and lowering the targets for this year's afforestation and soil conservation plans. Later, after instructions from the county committee, the Party branch and management committee reopened the discussion, initially overcoming the conservative thinking of cadres and Party members, relying on experienced farmers, and mobilizing the masses to conduct a wide-ranging debate among the cooperative members. As a result, they found eleven simple and effective methods to tap into labor potential amounting to 13,245 workdays. This not only solved the original labor shortage but also created a surplus of more than 6,700 workdays, providing a reliable guarantee for this year's great leap forward in production. The cooperative members reflected, saying: "The debate refutes the difficulty theory; it is people who can save labor. As long as everyone works together, there's no need to worry about achieving 400 jin."
    The eleven methods the Pioneer Cooperative used to solve the labor shortage are:
    1. Dig caves on the spot, so cattle and sheep do not enter the village. The cooperative has 21 head of cattle and 420 sheep. In the past, the cattle and sheep returned to the village to enter their pens for the winter every year, which resulted in a lot of wasted labor transporting soil from outside the village to line the pens in winter, and then transporting manure from the village to the fields in the spring. After on-site surveys, the cooperative can dig 28 soil caves under the 14 high cliffs in places such as Gaonao Ao, to pen livestock and accumulate fertilizer, solving the problem of fertilizing 380 mu of remote land, saving a total of 2,580 human and animal workdays.
    2. Threshing grounds nearby, and composting on the spot. The masses of the whole cooperative are preparing to switch to burning coal this year, and compost the stalks of more than 500 mu of jade maize, sorghum, etc. on the spot by digging pits. At the same time, they will take measures such as cutting artemisia by the weir to compost on the spot, cutting firewood on the mountain to smoke fertilizer at the foot of the mountain, and opening three remote threshing grounds to thresh nearby, which can save a total of 700 workdays.
    3. Add and transform tools to improve labor efficiency. The cooperative is implementing the "Four Great Transformations": First, changing from using ox carts to haul coal to using rubber-tired carts; second, changing from human carrying to animal carrying; third, changing from small flat carts to push and pull instead of manual carrying; and fourth, changing from soil plows to new-style farm tools such as mountain plows. These four items can save a total of 2,600 workdays per year.
    4. Every household prepares a food bucket, delivering both breakfast and lunch, overcoming the phenomenon of late arrivals, early departures, and loafing. From the busy farming season in February to the end of the late-stage field processing in July, 1,760 more workdays can be added in six months, increasing the general attendance rate by 20%.
    5. Moving households up the mountain, planting nearby on remote land. Tanshan Gully has more than 50 mu of good land, and even from the nearest Dongzhuang, it is still eight li round trip to plant it. Three households of cooperative member Li Ailiu moved there to live, turning remote land into nearby land, saving 650 workdays per year.
    6. Digging dry wells at the edge of the village saves labor from carrying water. Guangdongzhuang and Hejian villages alone can save 1,200 water-carrying workdays per year for 44 households.
    7. Give play to the role of women and tap their potential. The cooperative has 56 full and semi-able-bodied women, who worked a total of 2,464 workdays last year, an average of only 44 workdays per person. A very important reason for this is the burden of household chores. To solve this problem, the cooperative has set up sewing groups and teams have organized childcare groups, and grinding discs have been installed in cave dwellings, freeing up a total of 1,575 workdays for women to put into production.
    8. Carry a load of manure to the fields in spring and winter, and bring back crops when returning home in autumn and summer. To gradually cultivate such a habit in the whole cooperative, a total of 1,300 workdays can be saved per year.
    9. Improve the individual responsibility system for land to prevent land collapse. Last year, the three-guarantee responsibility system of guaranteeing seedling emergence, guaranteeing no bird or pest damage, and guaranteeing flood and erosion prevention was implemented with good results. Only eleven small pieces of land were eroded by two major rainstorms. This year, we will continue to implement it, saving several hundred workdays of land repair throughout the year.
    10. Use natural terrain - sliding manure down from high cliffs, saving 460 workdays per year.
    11. Cadres go down to the fields and leave the office. This year, the seven cadres of the cooperative management committee are required to work an average of 240 workdays per year, an increase of 420 compared to last year.
    Due to the adoption of the above measures, the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative has already saved 5,300 workdays. The whole cooperative is now actively carrying out the spring plowing movement.

    先锋社一场大辩论驳倒“困难论”
    巧安排，劳力不足变有余
    本报讯　记者展潮报道：山西省沁县先锋农业社经过群众性大鸣、大放、大辩论后，提出十一项有效的措施，解决了生产大跃进中劳力缺乏的困难。
    先锋农业生产合作社，是沁县次村乡东庄的一个小社。全社七十二户，只有男女全劳力和半劳力一百一十五人，实际能常年参加田间劳动的男女劳力只有四十多人，他们每人平均耕地二十五亩。由于劳力缺乏，去年就有一百多亩地没有适时下种，有一千多担肥料春种结束后还没有送到地，有三十亩豆田根本没有锄过，大秋作物锄耧平均只有两遍，这样便影响了收成。
    当提出生产大跃进，今年每亩平均产粮四百斤以后，社员群众心里虽也感到兴奋，但是却发愁地说：“多打粮食谁还不愿意？就是多集肥施肥要人！掘井开渠灌溉要人！精耕细作也要人！一句话，劳力缺怎么办？”的确，根据农业社今年发展农、林、牧和副业规划计算下来，他们总共需要二万九千八百个工。如果按每个男劳力平均做三百个工、女劳力做一百个工计算，全社一年也只能有二万三千三百个工，比需要少六千五百个工。
    面临着这个困难，先锋社党支部和管理委员会曾经有过打算：荒废一百四十亩耕地，降低今年绿化和水土保持计划指标。后来，经过县委会的指示，党支部和管理委员会重新展开讨论，初步克服了干部、党员中的保守思想，依靠老农、发动群众，在社员中广泛展开大辩论，结果找到了十一项简易而有效的办法，发掘劳动潜力一万三千二百四十五个，不仅解决了原先劳力欠缺的困难，而且还长余了六千七百多个工，使今年的生产大跃进有了可靠的保证。社员们反映说：“辩论驳倒困难论，事在人为能省工，只要大家一股劲，不愁实现四百斤。”
    先锋社解决劳力缺乏的十一项办法是：
    一、就地打窑洞，牛羊不进村。这个社共有耕牛二十一头、羊四百二十只。过去每年牛羊都回村入圈过冬，造成冬季从村外拉土垫圈、春季又从村里拉粪上地，往返浪费了不少劳力。经过实地勘察，全社可在高垴凹等十四处高崖下打土窑二十八孔，圈畜积肥，解决三百八十亩远地施肥问题，共可节省人、畜工二千五百八十个。
    二、就近打场，就地沤肥。全社群众准备今年改烧煤，把五百多亩玉茭、高粱等秸秆就地打坑沤肥，同时采取堰边割蒿就地沤肥、山上割柴山下熏肥，以及开辟三个远地碾场就近打场等办法，共可节省劳力七百个。
    三、增添和改造工具，提高劳动效率。全社实行“四大变”：一变牛车拉煤为胶轮车拉煤；二变人担为牲口驮；三变小平车推拉代替人力担挑；四变土犁为山地犁等新式农具。这四项全年共可节省二千六百个工。
    四、家家备饭桶，早、午两送饭，克服迟到早退窝工现象，从2月农忙到7月结束田间后期加工，六个月里可增多一千七百六十个工，比一般出勤率提高20％。
    五、迁户上山，远地近种。檀山沟有五十多亩好地，从最近的东庄去种往返也得八里路，社员李爱留三户人家搬到那里去住，变远地为近，每年可节省劳力六百五十个。
    六、村边打旱井，省下担水工。光东庄、合尖两村四十四户每年即可节省担水工一千二百个。
    七、发挥妇女作用，挖掘妇女潜力。这个社妇女全半劳力五十六个，去年共做二千四百六十四个劳动日，每人平均只做四十四个劳动日，其中很重要的原因是家事拖累。为了解决这个问题，今年社设缝衣小组，队队组织托儿组，碾盘安到窑房里，这样使妇女共腾出一千五百七十五个劳动日，投入生产。
    八、春冬上地捎担粪，秋夏回家捎庄稼。要在全社逐渐养成这样的习惯，一年共可节余一千三百个工。
    九、健全个人责任地，防止土地塌毁。去年实行了一保全苗出土、二保无鸟雀虫害、三保防洪冲地的三保责任地制度后，效果很好，两次大暴雨只冲刷土地十一小块。今年仍坚持实行，全年可节省修整土地工几百个。
    十、利用天然地形——高崖往下溜粪，每年可节省工四百六十个。
    十一、干部下田间，走出办公室。今年要求社管理委员会七个干部每人每年平均做二百四十个劳动日，比去年可增加四百二十个。
    由于采取了上述措施，先锋农业生产合作社已经节余出五千三百个工。全社现在正积极开展备耕运动。
