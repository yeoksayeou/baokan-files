Sugarcane By-products are a Treasure
By our reporter Zhao Ying

Sugarcane by-products are a resource with significant economic value.

Fully utilizing sugarcane bagasse to extract fiber will help solve the clothing problem for the people of the whole country. Tests have proven that each ton of bagasse can extract 100 to 150 kilograms of fiber, and the bagasse produced from each mu of sugarcane field can produce 77 to 115 kilograms of fiber, which is about four to six times more than the fiber that can be made from each mu of cotton. In 1957, Guangdong Province planted 1.76 million mu of sugarcane, yielding 1.35 million tons of bagasse, which can be used to manufacture 135,000 to 200,000 tons of fiber. According to engineers from the Guangdong Sugarcane Sugar Industry Research Institute, the method and equipment for extracting fiber from sugarcane bagasse are not special, and the Andong Artificial Fiber Factory can manufacture them.

Manufacturing paper is another important use of sugarcane bagasse. In addition to manufacturing general packaging paper and newsprint, it can also make high-grade paper, such as woodfree printing paper, typing paper, and tracing paper. The trial production of using bagasse to make wall panels and sound insulation paper has also been successful. Using bagasse to make paper can save wood, and the cost is lower than using wood to make paper. According to Soviet experts' experiments, raw materials for making nylon can also be extracted from bagasse, and the extraction does not affect the use of bagasse for papermaking. Among sugarcane by-products, the only one that has been utilized in the past is waste molasses. It is mainly used to manufacture alcohol, and secondly to make soy sauce and cane syrup. At present, the state-owned Shunde, Shitou, and Jieyang sugar factories have attached alcohol workshops, which produce about 3,000 tons of alcohol annually from waste molasses. The Guangdong Sugarcane Sugar Industry Research Institute is also studying the extraction of industrial raw material aconitic acid from waste molasses.

Sugarcane filter mud, which has always been regarded as waste or used as fertilizer, can be used to extract valuable high-melting-point sugarcane wax after testing. High-melting-point sugarcane wax is a raw material for manufacturing records, insulators, and mimeograph paper. Every 100 jin of sugarcane can produce 1.5 to 2.5 jin of dry filter mud. The imported sugarcane wax now costs more than 24,000 yuan per ton, but if it is extracted by ourselves, the price will be much lower.

    甘蔗副产品是个“宝”
    本报记者　赵颖
    甘蔗的副产品是一种有很大经济价值的资源。
    充分利用蔗渣提炼纤维，将有助于解决全国人民的穿衣问题。试验证明：每一吨蔗渣可以提炼一百到一百五十公斤纤维，每亩蔗田所出的蔗渣可以制造七十七到一百一十五公斤纤维，比每亩棉花能制成的纤维约多四倍到六倍。1957年广东省种植一百七十六万亩甘蔗，可得蔗渣一百三十五万吨计算，可以利用来制造纤维十三万五千吨到二十万吨。据广东甘蔗糖业科学研究所的工程师介绍，用甘蔗渣提炼纤维的方法和设备并不特殊，安东人造纤维厂就可以制造。
    制造纸张是甘蔗渣的另一个重要用途。除了可以制造一般的包装纸和白报纸以外，还可以制高级纸张，如道林纸、打字纸、描画纸等；用蔗渣制壁板和隔音纸，也已试制成功。用蔗渣造纸，可以节约木材，而且成本比木材造纸低。据苏联专家的试验，蔗渣中还可以提取制尼龙用的原料，提炼后并不影响蔗渣造纸。在甘蔗副产品中，过去曾经利用过的只有废糖蜜。它主要用来制造酒精，其次可以制酱油和酒糖。目前国营顺德、市头和揭阳糖厂附设有酒精车间，每年用废糖蜜制酒精三千吨左右。广东甘蔗糖业科学研究所还在研究从废糖蜜中提取工业原料乌头酸。
    一向被看成废物或作肥料用的甘蔗滤泥，经过试验，可以提取出名贵的高熔点蔗腊。高熔点蔗腊是制造唱片、绝缘体和打字腊纸的原料。每一百斤甘蔗能出干滤泥一斤半到二斤半。现在进口的蔗腊，每吨需人民币二万四千多元，如自行提取，价钱要低得多。
