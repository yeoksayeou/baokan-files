    Megaphone
    At the International Conference on the Law of the Sea in Geneva, representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia proposed that "all countries should be prohibited from conducting nuclear weapons tests on the high seas." Everyone knows that this proposal was aimed at the United States' illegal act of conducting nuclear tests on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
    Although the U.S. representative at the conference had repeatedly declared that the U.S. nuclear tests on the high seas were in accordance with international law, the U.S. representative did not dare to openly propose a counter-proposal to the above-mentioned proposal of the Soviet Union and other countries. However, the Portuguese delegation suddenly emerged halfway, advocating that countries should have "the freedom to conduct research, experiments, and exploration" on the high seas. It goes without saying for whom the Portuguese delegation was requesting this freedom.
    At a time when the world is condemning the illegal acts of the United States, the Portuguese delegation's actions clearly expose that it is nothing more than a megaphone for the United States.

    传声筒
    在日内瓦举行的国际海洋法会议上，苏、波、捷和南斯拉夫的代表建议，主张“各国一律不得在公海进行核武器试验”。谁都知道，这项建议是针对着美国将要在太平洋的恩纳威托克岛上进行核试验的非法行为的。
    虽然，美国代表在这个会议上曾经多次宣布美国在公海上进行核试验是符合国际法的，美国的代表还没有敢公然对苏联等国的上述建议提出反建议。然而，葡萄牙的代表团却从半路里杀出，主张规定各国在公海上有“进行研究、实验和探测的自由”。葡萄牙的代表团在为谁要求这种自由，是不言而喻的。
    在天下都在斥责美国的非法行为的时候，葡萄牙代表团的这种做法，清楚地暴露了它不过是美国的一个传声筒而已。
