Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 4th - A busy spring plowing scene has emerged in the Huaibei Plain of Anhui. More than two million mu of the eight million mu of spring land have already been plowed. Ox carts transporting manure to the fields come and go without end. Farmers in the eight counties of the Bengbu Special District have already delivered over one hundred million dan of fertilizer to the land.

This year, spring plowing and production in Huaibei started more than half a month earlier than in previous years, and a new element has been added - changing to rice cultivation. On the boundless plain, earthen enclosures have been built, and within the enclosures, fields crisscross, with ditches like nets. Farmers have already built more than three million mu of paddy field ridges and prepared more than two hundred thousand mu of seedling beds. More than two million mu of early rice will be sown this spring. For the first time, the phenomenon of hardened fields overwintering has been eliminated on the plain, and spring plowing achieves deep plowing and fine harrowing.

    淮北平原新春新景
    送粪车辆往来不绝
    春地普遍深耕细耙
    新华社合肥4日电　安徽淮北平原出现了一片繁忙的春耕景象。八百多万亩春地已经耕过了两百万亩。送粪下地的牛车在田间往返不绝。蚌埠专区八个县农民已经把上亿担的肥料送到了地里。
    今年淮北春耕生产比往年提早了半个多月，同时增添了一项新内容——改种水稻。在一望无际的平原上，一个个土圩圈起来了，圩内阡陌纵横，沟渠如网。农民们已打好田埂三百多万亩，整好秧田二十多万亩。今春就要播种二百多万亩早稻。平原上第一次消灭了板田过冬现象，春耕做到耕深耙细。
