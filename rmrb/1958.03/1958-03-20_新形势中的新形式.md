Title: New Forms in the New Situation

In Shanghai, the situation presses people, and so do the forms.

One example is the "General" style of big-character posters.  Naming names, specific problems, straightforward criticism, pasted directly to the criticized person's office. Right in front of their desk, visible at a glance, shocking, not allowing you to ignore it; not allowing you to not correct your mistakes. If the problem isn't solved, the error not corrected, it's feared you can't peacefully work at your desk. However, what I saw were mostly workers facing these big-character posters with beaming faces. Facing criticism without anger, I think at least the problem is being solved.

Whether there are such big-character posters in the dormitories, I haven't seen, but if someone makes excuses not to come to the office, hiding in the dormitory for peace and quiet, the big-character posters will probably fly there too. Since they can enter the office, why can't they enter the dormitory?

Another example is the "General" meeting. It is said that a leading comrade in one department repeatedly promised comrades within the department to spend one to two days a week going deep into the grassroots, but ultimately couldn't leave the office. This time, she again proposed a guarantee at the rectification meeting: to spend one-third to one-half of her time each week going deep into the grassroots. The comrades in the department said to her, "We don't need your self-criticism and guarantees, but we want to see your actual actions." They wanted her to answer this question: When exactly can you go down? This put her in a "checkmate" position, and she had to agree: go down after the meeting. After the meeting, she arranged her work and took cadres to the grassroots.

Some say that this "General" style of big-character posters and General meetings is a bit of a Shanghai style. I don't think this is important. What is important is that it is a sharp weapon for sweeping away bureaucratism, stagnation, arrogance, and spoiled habits. It is also being wielded by people full of revolutionary spirit, in the midst of a fervent revolutionary tide, for revolutionary purposes. And they are all to the point and immediately effective. I ask, what kind of evil spirit can stand its ground before this form? If this is truly the Shanghai style, I think this is the revolutionary wind in the Shanghai style, and it is worth spreading widely.

"General" style big-character posters and General meetings are both good forms. This form naturally arises from the surging situation, but it in turn will promote this situation; it naturally also requires people's spirit of seeking truth from facts and their attitude of being kind to others, but in fact, it is not forcing people, but all harmful evil spirits. It is forcing people to advance, not forcing people to retreat. Those beaming workers are living proof.

    新形势中的新形式
    戴学文
    在上海，形势逼人，形式也逼人。
    例子之一是“将军”式的大字报。提名叫姓，具体的问题，直截了当的批评，一直贴到被批评者的办公室去。就在案头前，抬头可见，触目惊心，不容你置而不答；不容你有过不改。问题没解决，错误不改正，怕是难于安心伏案工作的。然而我看到的，却多是面对着这样的大字报而满面春风的工作者。面对批评而无愠色，我想至少问题是正在解决着的。
    宿舍里是否也有这样的大字报，我没有看到，但如果有人托辞不来办公室，藏在宿舍里躲清静，大字报想也会飞到那里去的。它既然进得了办公室，为什么又进不得宿舍呢？
    例子之二是“将军”会。据说有一个部门的领导同志，曾屡次向部内同志保证每周抽出一天到两天深入基层，却又终于离不开办公室。她这次又在整风会议上又提出保证：每周以三分之一到二分之一的时间深入基层。部内的同志对她说：“我们不需要你的检讨和保证，而是要看到你的实际行动”。他们要她回答这个问题：究竟什么时候能下去？这就将了她的“军”，她只好答应：开完会就下去。开完会，她把工作安排了一下，就带了干部下基层去了。
    有人说，这种“将军”式的大字报和将军会，未免有点海派作风。我看这并不重要，重要的是，它是荡除官气、暮气、骄气和娇气的锐利武器，它又是在热烈的革命潮流之中，为充满革命精神的人们所掌握，为着革命的目的而使用的。而且都是一针见血，立见功效。试问什么样的邪气能在这形式前站得住脚。倘这真的就是海派作风的话，我以为这是海派中的革命之风，是值得广为传播的。
    “将军”式的大字报和将军会都是好形式。这形式自然是由万马奔腾的形势中产生的，然而，它反过来又会推进这形势；它自然也需要人们的实事求是的精神和与人为善的态度，然而它其实逼的不是人，而是一切有害的邪气。它逼人前进，而不是逼人后退。那些满面春风的工作者就是活的证据。
