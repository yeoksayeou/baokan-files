Xinhua News Agency, London, March 10th: British Labour MP Harold Wilson, who recently visited the Soviet Union, China, and the United States, pointed out that the Soviet Union and China have posed serious economic challenges to Britain.

In a speech Wilson delivered at a rally in Plymouth last night, he said that in the Soviet Union, there is no production stagnation or economic decline, and huge development plans are underway, disregarding the eyes of advertisers. He said that while Britain's education scale is shrinking day by day, only able to cope with some of the most basic scientific research, the Soviet Union is training more and more scientists and technicians.

Wilson said that China intends to further implement their huge, mass-based industrial development plans in the next fifteen years. He said that if we simply see China as a competitor, then this situation can be considered a danger to British export industries; but if we look at China from the perspective of having 600 million customers, then this situation will be a potentially unlimited market for Britain.

Wilson pointed out that Britain has become "a satellite state" of American policy. He said that the Conservative government has excessively tied itself to the American economic chariot. He fears that the US economic recession will have a serious impact on Britain.

    英工党议员威尔逊说
    英国已沦为美国卫星国
    担心美国经济衰退会祸延英国
    新华社伦敦10日电　刚刚访问了苏联、中国和美国的英国工党议员哈罗德·威尔逊指出：苏联和中国向英国提出了严重的经济挑战。
    威尔逊昨天晚上在普利茅斯集会上发表的演说里说，在苏联，没有生产停滞和经济下降，可以不顾及广告商的眼色的巨大发展计划正在进行着。他说，当英国的教育规模正在日益缩小，只能应付一些最基本的科学研究的时候，苏联正在训练出越来越多的科学家和技术人员。
    威尔逊说，中国打算在今后十五年内，进一步执行他们巨大的、群众性的工业发展计划。他说，如果我们单纯地把中国看成是一个竞争对手，那么，这种情况可以认为是英国出口工业的危险；但是如果我们从一个拥有六亿顾客的角度来看中国，那么这种情况对于英国将是一个潜在的无限制的市场。
    威尔逊指出，英国已经变成美国政策的“一个卫星国”。他说，保守党政府过份地把自己束缚在美国的经济车厢上。他担心美国经济衰退会给英国带来严重影响。
