Who Takes the Lead in the Great Leap Forward
Yilong County Women Propose a Competition Initiative to Rural Women Nationwide

(Reported by this newspaper) At the Yilong County Women's Model Congress, held in the hometown of Vice Chairman Zhu De in Sichuan, the 305 model attendees and all female cadres, representing the 200,000 women of the county, proposed a friendly competition initiative to rural women nationwide, focusing on labor production and thriftiness in managing households.

They proposed: (1) Around the "March 8th" International Women's Day, actively participate in labor within their capabilities during the enthusiastic drive to transform mountains and accumulate fertilizer. Women's fertilizer accumulation should reach 60% of the total. (2) Actively participate in agricultural production, ensuring that 95% of the female labor force goes to work. Strong laborers without household burdens should earn 1,800 to 2,000 work points annually, while general laborers should earn more than 1,000 work points. (3) Develop sideline production, aiming for each household to raise five pigs in 1958. (4) Manage households thriftily, with each household saving two liang of grain per day, cherishing every grain of rice, every inch of cloth, every fen of money, and every piece of firewood, achieving surplus grain in over 80% of households and savings in over 60% of households.
