Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th – Soviet scientists have achieved initial success in manufacturing a "mechanical hand" controlled by human thought. According to an article recently published in "Soviet Russia," the wrist of the Soviet-made "mechanical hand" will bend when a person thinks of bending their wrist in their mind, driven by the "bioelectricity" from the person's body.

It is known that the Soviet Union has long used a "mechanical hand" in atomic energy research. This is because some operating rooms in atomic energy research institutes are filled with a large amount of radiation, making it impossible for people to operate inside. Instead, they must use a "mechanical hand" to operate. The "mechanical hand" is installed in the operating room and connected to a machine in the next room. The operator puts their hands into the machine in the next room and observes the situation in the operating room through thick, special glass windows. At this time, whatever movements the operator makes with their hands, the "mechanical hand" in the next room will also make the same movements. For example, if the operator makes the movements of taking a container and pouring liquid into the machine in their own room, the "mechanical hand" in the operating room will accurately repeat this action and pour the liquid from one container to another in the operating room according to the operator's intention.

Now, Soviet scientists want to manufacture another more ingenious "mechanical hand": to make this "mechanical hand" perform a certain action, the operator does not even need to move their hands, but only needs to think about it in their mind. The "Soviet Russia" article reported the initial achievements of Soviet scientists in this area.

The article pointed out that scientists have discovered that all living organisms have electrical phenomena, i.e., so-called bioelectricity. When nerves and muscles are active, bioelectric currents are generated. According to measurements, this current reaches tens to hundreds of microvolts. Long-term experiments and observations have shown that muscles produce bioelectricity even before they contract, and the strength of the current is proportional to the force the muscle is about to exert. This is the basis for creating a bioelectric "mechanical hand."

When introducing the use of bioelectric currents to control machines, the article said that electrodes (a type of metal sheet with wires) are installed on the muscles of the arm, and the wires are connected to electronic instruments. The electronic instruments are connected to the device that drives the "mechanical hand" through a current amplification device. As soon as a person thinks of bending their wrist, the electronic instrument will indicate an increase in the bioelectric current in the muscles that are about to perform this action. Therefore, before the person's wrist bends, the signal from the person's brain to the hand is "detected" by the instrument. This muscle bioelectric current, amplified hundreds of thousands of times, is transmitted to the execution machine, the so-called driving device, which can make the "mechanical hand" perform corresponding actions.

The article concludes by saying that in the future, there may be submersible machines with this kind of "mechanical hand." After putting this machine to the bottom of the water, the person sitting in front of the underwater television screen installed in the cabin can make the machine do whatever action they think of underwater.

### 按人思维动作　辅助研究工作  苏联“机械手”制造成功

    按人思维动作　辅助研究工作
    苏联“机械手”制造成功
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联科学家在制造由人的思想来操纵的“机械手”方面已经取得初步成就。苏联制成的“机械手”的手腕在人脑中刚想弯曲手腕的时候，就会由人身上的“生物电”带动而弯曲起来，这是“苏维埃俄罗斯报”最近发表的一篇文章说的。
    大家知道，苏联在原子能研究工作中早已使用了一种“机械手”来工作。因为原子能研究所中有某些操作房间充满了大量射线，人无法在里面操作，必须利用“机械手”来操作。“机械手”装在操作房间内，同隔壁房间的一个机械连在一起。操作者在隔壁房间里把双手伸入机械，隔着厚厚的特种玻璃窗观察操作房间中的情况。这时只要操作者双手作什么动作，隔壁的“机械手”也会作什么动作。例如操作者只要把伸入机械内的双手在自己的房间里作出拿器皿和倒液体的动作，操作房间中的“机械手”就会准确地重复这一动作，而按照操作者的意思把操作房间中的某一器皿的液体倒入另一器皿。
    现在苏联科学家还要制造另一种更巧妙的“机械手”：要使这种“机械手”做某种动作，操作者连手都无需动，只要脑中想一想就行了。“苏维埃俄罗斯报”的这篇文章报道了苏联科学家在这方面取得的初步成就。
    文章指出，科学家们发现，在一切活机体的身上都有电现象，即有所谓生物电。当神经和肌肉紧张活动时，就会产生生物电流，这种电流据测量达到百万之几十和几百伏特。长期的试验和观察表明，肌肉甚至在它收缩以前就会产生生物电，电流的强弱与肌肉要发出的力量成正比。这就是创造生物电动“机械手”的基础。
    文章在介绍用生物电流操纵机器的情况时说，在手臂的肌肉上安上一些电极（一种带导线的金属片），把导线连在电子仪器上。电子仪器经过电流加强装置同带动“机械手”的装置连在一起。只要人一想弯曲手腕，电子仪器就会表明要进行这种动作的肌肉中生物电流的增加。因此，在人的手腕弯曲之前，从人的大脑向手发出的信号就被仪器“觉察”到了。这种肌肉生物电流在加强数十万倍后传给执行机械，即所谓带动装置，就可以使“机械手”做出相应的动作。
    文章最后说，今后也许会出现带有这种“机械手”的潜水机械。在把这种机械放到水底去以后，坐在安装在船舱里的水底电视机萤光屏前的人，只要想做什么动作，这个机械人就会在水下做什么动作。
