    Lime Shouldn't Be Sprinkled in Manure Pits
    Some newspapers and periodicals, when introducing the achievements of the patriotic health campaign in Xiaoying Lane, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, mentioned that there were no maggots in the manure pits because quicklime was sprinkled in them. There is something worth discussing about this. I believe that although using quicklime sprinkled in the manure pit is a good way to prevent the occurrence of maggots, it is also unreasonable and unscientific. Because quicklime, when it comes into contact with human manure and urine, easily causes the loss of nitrogen in the manure and urine, and nitrogen is one of the main nutrients needed by crops. At present, all localities are carrying out agricultural production increase campaigns, striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production. One of the key to achieving this goal is to apply a large amount of fertilizer, mainly farm manure such as human manure and urine compost. In order to avoid the loss of fertilizer in human manure and urine, I hope that agricultural science and health departments will come up with other methods of killing maggots.

    粪缸里不能撒石灰
    一些报刊上在介绍浙江杭州市小营巷爱国卫生运动成绩的时候，曾提到：粪缸中所以无蛆是因为撒上了生石灰。关于这一点有值得商讨的地方。我认为，为了防止蛆的发生，用生石灰撒在粪缸内虽是一个好办法，但也有不合理，不科学的地方。因为生石灰与人粪尿接触，很容易把粪尿中的氮损失掉，而氮则是农作物所需要的主要养分之一。目前各地正在开展农业增产运动，争取农业生产大丰收，要达到这个目的，其关键之一就要施用大量肥料，其中主要是农家肥料，如人粪尿堆肥等。为了免于人粪尿中的肥分受到损失，我希望农业科学和卫生部门给提出一些别的灭蛆办法。
