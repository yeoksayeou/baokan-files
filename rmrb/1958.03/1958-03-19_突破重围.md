Song of the Great Leap Forward

    Breaking Through the Encirclement
    Wan Guoru, worker at Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory
    Hua Wenzhong, the Party Branch Secretary of the dyeing workshop, was the last to leave the courtyard after the meeting. The sky was full of stars, and it was almost midnight.
    His mood was complicated.
    This was the fourth mobilization meeting like today's. More than six thousand big-character posters had been produced, covering the walls and the courtyard. But what had been solved? ...
    Today, someone openly criticized at the meeting: "Still mobilizing? Aren't there enough opinions raised by everyone? Mobilizing without solving problems, how can we eliminate waste?"
    This was a pointed criticism. The slow progress in solving problems formed a sharp contrast with the surging enthusiasm of the masses. Although he and the workshop director, Lao Cao, had made every effort—battling day and night to review the opinions, assigning specific people to solve the problems—the number of big-character posters grew by more than ten times each day. They were only able to parry, not to counterattack.
    Although it was late spring, the night was still cold. He walked along, deep in thought, opening his coat to let the cool breeze blow into his chest. At this moment, he heard two people talking behind the sheet covered with big-character posters.
    "How many big-character posters have you written in total?"
    "Forty. How about you?"
    "Not many, fifty. But, another mobilization today. How many do you want to write tomorrow?"
    "Not a single one! What's the use of writing if they don't solve the problems?"
    He stopped immediately upon hearing this.
    "We can't say that," the other continued, "It's not right to rely solely on the leaders to solve problems. Look, the branch secretary and the director's eyes are bloodshot. It's best if everyone raises problems and solves them together. Leaders don't have a thousand hands!"
    "Solve them ourselves?"
    "That's right. Look at this big-character poster, it's about our group's business, steam leaking from the pipe, causing waste. If we follow the rules, the director will approve it, hand it over to the maintenance team, and the maintenance team will assign the work. The date will be far off! If we do it ourselves, we can solve it by tightening the pipe for half an hour tomorrow morning! Do you have ink in your pen? Write it down, let our group solve it ourselves tomorrow. ..."
    His heart jumped. Something he had been pondering day and night was suddenly found at this accidental moment. Like finding a treasure, he trembled with excitement and strode towards the director's office.
    Director Lao Cao was buried in a pile of big-character posters, struggling to break through. The two piles of big-character posters on the desk were like two small mountains. He had stayed up for two nights, his eyes bloodshot, and his back seemed somewhat hunched. It was as if every big-character poster that was not solved in time put a thousand pounds of pressure on him.
    Now, he was hesitating about an opinion raised by a packaging worker: "The packaging ropes have never had a room to store them. They are always placed randomly in the yard. In summer, they are exposed to wind and rain. All year round, whoever needs them takes them, causing a lot of waste. I request to build a small house."
    Building a house was a construction project, requiring drawing, earthwork, and a lot of money. But if they didn't build it, the ropes were indeed being wasted a lot.
    What to do? Just then, Branch Secretary Hua Wenzhong rushed in like a gust of wind. After Lao Cao heard what the branch secretary had just overheard and the solution he had thought of on the way, he immediately jumped up: "Ah, we keep shouting that we must rely on the masses to solve problems, but where have we relied on them? Now, the masses are bringing solutions to our door, and we are still in the dark!" He said loudly, and began to pound on the door of the "Rectification" team.
    Zhang Quan and Wang Zimao, who were responsible for sorting the big-character posters and keeping copies, were also trapped in the encirclement of the big-character posters. Just now, they had just complained, wanting to "bombard" the branch secretary and the director because the problems were being solved too slowly. They counted the number of big-character posters every day, and the number always increased, with the number of solved problems accounting for less than 1% of the total. It was really embarrassing when workers asked.
    The director stepped into the room and said to Zhang Quan excitedly, "Now the enthusiasm of the masses can't be contained. They are all scrambling to solve problems. This time, we must keep up and combine the 'rectification' methods with the enthusiasm of the masses."
    After speaking, he began to list the contents of the big-character posters on a table, leaving a blank space below for those who voluntarily wanted to solve the problems to sign their names, and another column for the date of resolution. They separately extracted the opinions from the big-character posters onto many large tables, and while working, they posted them on the walls of the office. When they extracted 555 opinions, they filled the director's office, and it was also dawn. Finally, they wrote fourteen large characters: "Everyone works together to improve quickly, unite and strive for a great leap forward," and posted them above the table. They also gave this room a name called the "Key Room."
    They had just left the room when it was immediately crowded with workers from the night shift who had just gotten off work. Because they got the news first, Zhang Quan was originally a worker on this shift, temporarily drawn out to help with the rectification. After the branch secretary and the director discussed mobilizing everyone to "grab" keys tomorrow, he quietly told his shift in advance. Everyone had been holding back their energy with nowhere to use it, so when they heard about this, they could hardly wait to get off work. They didn't even change their clothes before running over.
    Inside the room, people were squeezed into a pot of porridge, noisy and clamoring, grabbing and snatching, everyone wanting to get ahead and grab more keys. Master Liu from the dyeing group, the tallest and strongest, squeezed to the front in a few shakes and grabbed fifteen waste problems in no time, writing his name below all of them; the date was: to be solved on the night shift tonight. Those who were short and weak complained, unable to squeeze forward, just getting angry and shouting outside.
    Wang Zimao was originally a worker on the middle shift. When he saw that everyone in the room "grabbing" keys was from the night shift, his eyes turned red immediately. He ran to the middle shift dormitory in three steps and two steps to call people. When people heard that all the keys in the workshop had been taken by the night shift, they crawled out of bed and ran to the factory. But it was already too late. As soon as they entered the factory gate, they saw the night shift workers, one by one, walking out energetically as if they had won a victory. Seeing them from afar, they shouted: "Go back to your quilts, you are like women sending off the dead, always behind! Our shift has contracted all 555 keys!" Sure enough, when they ran to the "Key Room," every problem had people's names and the time to solve the problem signed all over the place.
    Everyone blamed Wang Zimao for sending the message late. But they immediately discovered another problem: the night shift had written the date of resolution as tomorrow for many of them. "If we solve them today, then these keys will be 'grabbed' by us!" Someone reminded them, and everyone was overjoyed. They pulled out their pens and signed below the night shift's signatures.
    Old Master Liu Bingchang from the dyeing group only "grabbed" one key, steam leaking from the tank valve. Originally, someone from the night shift had already grabbed this key, and he shortened the time to solve it by eight hours, but he was still not at ease, fearing that someone else would grab it. So, he thought of solving it now. But he didn't expect that the people on duty were not just sleeping. When the news of "grabbing" keys in the morning of the night shift was broadcast on the loudspeaker, the early shift felt that things were not good, because they were producing on duty and couldn't leave the machines to "grab" keys. By the time they got off work, they wouldn't "grab" anything. Hey, their idea was even more powerful, simply starting to work in advance, regardless of who grabbed it! Anyway, whoever does it first counts. In this way, they repaired all the leaky pipes and dripping water gates during their shift.
    When Old Master Liu Bingchang found the leaking steam valve, Hao Yong, who was on duty, had already repaired it. He stared when he saw it and said to Hao Yong, "I 'grabbed' this key, who told you to take care of it?"
    Hao Yong said, "Stopping the leak one minute earlier reduces waste by one minute. What, do you have any objections? If you have any objections, 'bombard' me!" Two sentences pushed him back.
    However, there were also people who didn't "grab" a key. Packaging worker Lu Litong and management worker Lao Shen didn't "grab" one, but they gathered more than a dozen people who hadn't "grabbed" a key, whispered for a while, and ran to the backyard of the factory, not knowing what they were going to do.
    Director Lao Cao didn't go to sleep until dawn. When he woke up, it was already after 2 p.m. He didn't announce the problem of building a house for storing hemp ropes, because it would cost a lot of money and require approval from higher authorities. He decided to handle this problem himself. When he came to the factory, he first went to the backyard to see if he could find a suitable place to build the house, so that he could write a report to the higher authorities. But in the corner of the wall, a small house had appeared at some point. It was nailed together with old wooden boards, covered with a piece of fire-resistant felt, a small wooden house less than one person tall, and an old door was installed. Someone wrote a couplet on the door with chalk: "Heroes bravely grab keys, race against time to solve problems." He opened it and saw several bundles of hemp ropes neatly placed inside. Then, he suddenly understood that this small house was the house he was worried about, but now the workers had built it using waste materials.
    He stood in front of this small house for a long time, a fire burning in his heart. He ran to the "Key Room" and when he saw that all the keys had dense names and times signed below, he felt that the enormous power of the masses had freed him from the layers of encirclement. Finally, he copied down the couplet "Heroes bravely grab keys, race against time to solve problems," because the "Key Room" should have such a couplet.
            (4:00 AM, March 15th)

    突破重围
    天津织染厂工人　万国儒
    染色车间党支部书记化文仲，从会场上最后一个走出院来，满天星斗，这已是快交半夜的时分了。
    他心情很杂乱。
    像今天这样的动员会，算这次整开四次了。光大字报就干出六千多张，满墙满院，哪都贴的严严实实。可是解决的呢？……
    今天在会上有人公开提出指责：还动员呢，大伙提出的意见还少吗？光动员，不解决，这能反掉浪费吗？
    这是一个一针见血的批评。解
  决问题迟缓，和群众勃起的干劲形
  成了一个鲜明的对比。虽然，他和车间主任老曹，做了百分之百的努力：突围，连天连夜的批意见，指派专人解决问题，可是大字报每天比解决的多十几倍，真是，只有招架之功，没有还手之力了。
    虽然是交春的天气了，但夜间还是冷的，他愁思着，走着，把怀敞开，让嗖嗖的小凉风，使劲往怀里吹拂。这时，他听到在贴满大字报的席片后面，有两个人在说话。
    “你一共写几张大字报啦？”
    “四十张。你呢？”
    “不多，五十张。可是，今个又动员啦，明天你想写多少呀？”
    “一张也不写！写了不解决，管个屁用。”
    他一听连忙停了下来。
    “不能这么说，”另一个继续着，“光靠领导解决问题不行，你看，支书和主任的两眼都熬红了。最好是大伙提问题大伙解决，光靠领导，领导也没长出千只手呀！”
    “自己解决？”
    “对呀，你看这张大字报，就是咱们小组的事，管子跑汽，浪费。这要是按规矩走，主任批完了，交给保全组，保全组再分分工，日子就远去啦！要咱们自己干呢，明天早上个半钟头的，把管子拧把拧把就解决啦！怎么，你的钢笔有水吗？写上吧，明天由咱们组自己解决。……”
    他的心猛然一动，一个昼夜焦思的东西，在这偶然的一瞬间找到了。就像拾到宝贝一样，混身激动的发抖，迈开大步，就朝主任办公室跑去。
    主任老曹，这时正埋在大字报堆里，苦战突围。在桌子上堆的两堆大字报，赛似两座小山，他熬了两个通宵了，两眼通红通红的，背，似乎也有些驼了，好像，每一张没及时解决的大字报，都给他以千斤的压力。
    现在，他正对一个意见犯犹疑，这是一个打包工人提出的意见：向来，打包绳子没个屋子存放，都是乱放在院里，夏天，风吹雨淋，一年四季谁用谁拿，浪费很大。要求盖间小房子。
    盖房子，这是基建的事，绘图，兴土木，要花很多的钱。不盖吧，的的确确，这绳子糟蹋的很多。
    怎么办？就这时候，支书化文仲像阵风似的闯了进来。老曹听完支书方才听到的事情，和他在飞跑的路上，想出的解决问题的方法，顿时一跃而起：“哎呀，我们整天喊，要依靠群众解决问题，可我们依靠到哪去了。现在，大伙都把办法送上门来了，我们还蒙在鼓里呢！”他大声的说着，便咚咚的擂起“整改”小组的门来。
    负责整理大字报留底的张全和王子茂，同样也陷入大字报的包围中。方才他俩刚发过一顿牢骚，要给支书和主任“鸣”一张，因为解决问题太慢了，他俩每天统计大字报数，总是有增无减，解决数占不了总数1％，工人一问，真难为情。
    主任跨进门来，兴高彩烈地对张全说：“现在群众的干劲都憋不住了，都在抢着解决问题，咱们这回一定要跟上去，把‘整改’方法和群众热情结合起来。”
    说罢就动手把大字报的内容摘要列在表上，下面留一个空白的地方，让自动愿意解决问题的人签名，还有一格是解决的日期。他们分头把大字报的意见摘录在许多大表格上，一边干一边往办公室的墙上贴，摘到五百五十五条意见，便把主任办公室贴满了，天也亮了，最后又写了十四个大字：“人人动手改的快，齐心努力大跃进”，贴在表的上面。又给这个屋子起了一个名字叫：“关键室”。
    他们刚刚离开这个房子，马上便被刚下班的夜班工人挤满了。因为他们得到的消息最早，张全原是这一班的工人，临时抽出来帮助整改的。当支书和主任商量好明天发动大伙“抢”关键之后，他就悄悄的提先告诉本班了。大伙本来早就憋足劲没处使呢，一听这个事，好容易熬到下班，连衣服也没换，就跑来了。
    屋里，人挤成一锅粥，嘈嘈嚷嚷，抢抢夺夺，谁都想抢到前边，多抢几个关键。染色组柳师傅，长
  的个子最高，力气也最大，一挤两晃就抢到最前边来，没一会的工夫，在十五个浪费问题的下面，全
  写上自己的名字；日期是：今天上夜班就解决。个矮，力气小的人叫苦了，挤不上前钻不进去，光气的在外边闹唤。
    王子茂原是中班的工人，当他一看，一屋“抢”关键的人全是夜班的，登时就红眼了，三步两步就跑到中班宿舍喊人去了。人们一听全车间的关键，都叫夜班抢去了，从被窝爬出来，就往厂子跑。但是，已经晚了，一进厂门口，正看夜班的人，一个一个，精神抖擞像打了胜仗似的往外走。见他们，远远就喊：“快回去钻被窝吧，你们是娘们送殡，走在后头啦，五百五十五个关键，我们这班包干了！”果然，当他们跑到“关键室”，每一个问题下面，都横七竖八的签上了人名字和解决问题的时间。
    大伙就埋怨王子茂送信送晚了。可是他们马上又发现一个问题，夜班的人把很多解决的日期全是写的明天的。“如果我们今天就解决，这关键就算我们‘抢’的！”不知谁提了一个醒，大伙一听可乐坏了，抽出笔来，就在夜班签名的下面签开了。
    染色组的刘炳昌老师傅，只“抢”到一个关键，是槽子汽门跑汽。本来这个关键，人家夜班已经有人抢了，他比人家又缩短了八个小时解决，可他还不放心，恐怕别人又给抢去。于是，他想着现在就解决。可是，他没想到人家在班的人也没睡大觉。当早晨夜班一开始“抢”关键的消息，在大喇叭里一广播，早班一听，觉得事情不妙，因为在班生产，不能离开机器“抢”关键去，等到下班，那什么也不会“抢”到的。嘿，他们想的这个办法更厉害，干脆提先下手干吧，管他谁抢去了呢？反正谁干在头，就算谁的。这样，他们在班上，就把漏汽的管子，滴水的水门全修好了。
    当刘炳昌老师傅，找到那个跑汽的汽门，人家在班的郝永早修好了。他一看瞪眼了，对郝永说：“这个关键我‘抢’了，谁让你管？”
    郝永说：“提先一分钟堵好，就少浪费一分钟的汽，怎么，你有意见呀？有意见‘鸣’去吧！”两句话，把他顶回来了。
    不过，也有没有“抢”到关键的人，打包工人陆立桐和管理工老沈就没“抢”到，可他俩集合了十几个没“抢”到关键的人，嘀咕了一阵子就跑到厂子后院不知干什么去了。
    主任老曹天亮后才去睡觉，等他一觉醒来，已经下午二点多了。他并没把盖盛麻绳子的房子问题公布出来，因为这要花很多钱，还要上级批准。他决定把这个问题留给自己办。来到厂里他先到后院转转，想找个盖房合适地点，好向上级写个报告。可是在墙角上，不知什么时候多出了一间小房子。这是用旧木板钉起来的，房顶蒙一块火?皮不到一人高的小木屋，还安了一个旧门，门口有人用粉笔写了一副对联：英雄奋勇抢关键，解决问题争时间。他拉开一看，里面整整齐齐放着几捆麻绳。于是，他顿然明白了，这个小屋正是他发愁的那间房子，然而，现在工人们利用废料，搭起来了。
    他在这个小屋门前站了很久，心里有一团火在燃烧着，连忙跑到“关键室”去，当他看到所有的关键下面都签上密密麻麻的人名和时间，他感觉到，现在群众巨大的力量，把他从层层的重围里解脱出来了。最后，他把那副“英雄奋勇抢关键，解决问题争时间”的对联抄了起来，因为“关键室”才应当有这么一副对联。
            （3月15日深夜四时）
