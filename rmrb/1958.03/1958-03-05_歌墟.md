    Song Fair [Note]
    Poem by Ji Ying
    Painting by Xia Tongguang
    In the past, we only sang of love, though love also struggled to resolve suffering; but even then, the song fair was often dispersed, and this cup of bitter wine was never fully drunk! Today's song fair is a sea of people, the mountains and fields are also singing in joy; combining love and labor together, we live in an ocean of happiness. White clouds linger on the peaks, listening intently to our singing. White clouds! Please fly to Beijing, and tell Chairman Mao the heart of the Zhuang people.
  [Note] Song Fair is a traditional festival of the Zhuang people. Every spring, men and women gather to sing and choose partners. (Attached picture)

    歌墟〔注〕
    纪英诗
    夏同光画过去我们只歌唱爱情，虽然爱情也难解苦难；但就这样歌墟也常被赶散，这杯苦酒也总未饮完！今天的歌墟人海人山，山谷和原野也在欢唱；把爱情和劳动结合一起，我们生活在幸福的海洋。白云停在峰巅，谛听我们歌唱。白云啊！请你飞到北京，把僮族的心意对毛主席讲。
  〔注〕歌墟是僮族的传统节日，每年春季，男女相聚唱歌，互相选择对象。（附图片）
