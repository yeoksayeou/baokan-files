    Thousands Compose, Tens of Thousands Sing, Farmers Perform and Enjoy Themselves
    Mass Cultural Activities in Mojiang Surge Like Spring Tide
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Yunnan Daily, in the great leap forward in production, mass amateur cultural activities in Mojiang County among workers, peasants, and soldiers are surging like a spring tide, showing a blossoming scene. The vast majority of townships in the county have established propaganda teams. The masses have created thousands of short plays, small operas, Lusheng tunes, Sanxian tunes, comic dialogues, etc. reflecting real life and struggles, becoming a powerful ideological weapon to promote the central tasks.
    The county's mass amateur cultural activities are being carried out under the slogans of "closely integrating with the production movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation" and "farmers write for farmers, farmers perform for farmers, farmers sing for farmers." The biggest feature of these cultural activities is: taking real people and events in the movement as the subject matter, the performance venue is the water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation site, and the actors and audiences are often witnesses or participants in the event. Many programs are even based on events that happened on the same day and are brought to the stage that night. Sometimes the actors and the audience sing and dance together, full of energy and high spirits, with soaring morale.
    If local ethnic forms and languages that are popular with the local people can be used in the performance, the audience's enthusiasm will be even higher, and they will repeatedly ask for encores. The audience often automatically requests "two more programs" during the performance. They perform their favorite ethnic cultural programs on the spot, and everyone enjoys themselves together.
    Many scripts, comic dialogues, and Lusheng tunes created by the masses, such as "Li Jiufa and Yin Baojia," "The Secretary of the Party Branch's Mother," "Looking Up and Seeing Chairman Mao," "Going to the Idle Market," and "The Lazy Man Returns Home," have now spread throughout remote villages and settlements. Li Dama, who is praised in the literary works for desperately accumulating fertilizer, has become a figure that the older generation wholeheartedly yearns for. Yang Xiuying, the women's director who is praised for doing everything possible to mobilize the masses to participate in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, is even more praised by the younger generation of women. As for the figures who insist on developing capitalism, who are criticized and satirized in the creations, they have long become living examples that people despise and take as a warning.
    This vigorous mass cultural activity has powerfully promoted great production. Many villages accumulate fertilizer day and night, becoming "cities that never sleep." The county accumulates an average of 200 million catties of fertilizer per day, and one day's achievement exceeds ten days in the past. The water conservancy construction site is even more a scene of intense and enthusiastic battle.
    The reason why Mojiang's worker, peasant, and soldier mass amateur cultural activities can develop so rapidly is that the Mojiang County Party Committee is good at discovering the creativity of the masses and foreseeing that after the great leap forward in production, there will be a blossoming scene in cultural life. Therefore, they gave timely support and leadership. Mojiang County is a multi-ethnic area with extremely rich ethnic folk culture. With the great leap forward in production, the cultural life requirements of the people of all ethnic groups are even more urgent. At the same time, they strongly demand to reflect their current struggles in cultural life and to praise the heroic figures in the struggles. Some comrades once underestimated this new situation. They were still satisfied with simply sending film projection teams and troupes to perform in the countryside on tour, and most of the programs performed were "The Blind Man Watching Lanterns" and "Three Variations of the Plum Blossom," etc., which were not closely integrated with the current struggle. The Mojiang County Party Committee promptly corrected this practice, put forward the instruction of "closely integrating with the current struggle" and carrying out mass cultural activities of "farmers write for farmers, farmers perform for farmers, farmers sing for farmers," and led the cultural activities to a healthy and prosperous road. The main responsible comrades of the county party committee and the district party committees personally led the formation of propaganda teams in various places, and even participated in scriptwriting and directing activities, making the cultural life of the county's farmers unprecedentedly active and powerfully promoting great production. Mojiang County's water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation work have all moved to the forefront of the entire special district.

    千人编万人唱农民自演自乐
    墨江群众文艺活动如春潮汹涌
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：在生产大跃进中，墨江县工农兵群众业余文艺活动势如春潮汹涌，出现了百花怒放的局面。全县绝大部分乡都成立了宣传队。群众创作了上千个反映现实生活和斗争的活报剧、小演唱、芦笙调、三弦调、相声等等，成为推动中心工作的有力的思想武器。
    这个县的群众业余文艺活动是在“紧密结合水利、积肥为中心的生产运动”和“农写农，农演农，农唱农”的口号下开展起来的。这些文艺活动的最大特点是：以运动中的真人真事为题材，演出场所就是水利建设和积肥工地，演员和观众往往就是这一事件的目击者或参与者，有许多节目更是当天发生的事，当晚就搬上舞台。有时演员同观众一起载歌载舞，精神焕发，群情高涨。
    在演出中如能运用当地人所喜闻乐见的民族形式、民族语言，观众情绪更是无比高涨，一再要求加演加唱。观众往往在演出时自动要求“出两个节目”，他们当场演出自己最喜爱的民族文艺节目，大家共同娱乐。
    群众创作的许多剧本、相声、芦笙调，比如“李九发和尹保甲”、“支部书记的母亲”、“抬头望见毛主席”、“赶闲街”、“懒汉回家”等等，目前已传遍穷乡僻壤，各村各寨。文艺作品中所歌颂的拼命积肥的李大妈，已成为老一代人衷心向往的人物；所歌颂的千方百计发动群众参加水利建设和积肥运动的妇女主任杨秀英，更为青年一代妇女所赞不绝口。至于创作中所批评讽刺的坚持发展资本主义的人物，则早已成为人们唾弃并以之为戒的活生生的典型了。
    这种蓬勃的群众文艺活动，有力地推动了大生产。许多乡村日夜积肥，成了“不夜之城”。全县平均每天积肥二亿斤，一天的成绩超过往日十天；在水利建设工地上更是一片紧张、热烈的战斗气象。
    墨江的工农兵群众业余文艺活动能够如此一日千里地蓬勃开展，是在于中共墨江县委善于发现群众的创造，预见到生产大跃进以后，在文艺生活上将会出现一个百花怒放的局面，因而及时给予了支持和领导。墨江县是多民族地区，民族民间文艺极为丰富。随着生产大跃进，各族群众文化生活的要求更加迫切，同时，极其强烈地要求在文化生活中反映他们当前的斗争，歌颂斗争中的英雄人物。有一部分同志曾经对这一新的情况估计不足，他们仍然满足于单纯派出电影队、剧团下乡巡回演出，而所演出的节目又多半是“瞎子观灯”、“梅花三弄”等与现实斗争结合得并不紧密的节目。中共墨江县委及时纠正了这种作法，提出“紧密结合现实斗争”，开展“农写农，农演农，农唱农”的群众性文艺活动的指示，把文艺活动引到了健康、繁荣的道路。县委和各区委的主要负责同志并亲自领导各地组成宣传队，甚至参加编剧、导演活动，使全县农民的文艺生活空前活跃起来，有力地推动了大生产，墨江县的水利建设和积肥工作都走到了全专区的前列。
