Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Special Dispatch: Liaoning Province has decided to achieve the agricultural development program (revised draft) grain production targets within this year. The province's total grain output plan for this year is required to increase from the originally planned eight million tons to ten million tons, striving to reach thirteen million tons. The guaranteed figure of ten million tons represents an increase of 31.5% over the bumper harvest of 1956. Among the province's fifty counties and cities, thirty-nine plan to reach and exceed the target of 500 jin per mu of land south of the Yellow River this year; ten counties and cities are to reach the target of 400 jin per mu. This revision of the planned targets was made at the Liaoning Provincial Rural Work Conference held from March 2nd to 7th.

	On the first day of the conference, Du Zheheng, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Governor of the province, in his report "Hard Struggle for Three Years to Change the Face of the Province," representing the Provincial Party Committee, proposed the requirement to exceed the grain production targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in three years. Subsequently, the prefectural and county party secretaries participating in the meeting, with the spirit of "daring to make soaring attempts" (Lenin's words), launched a heated activity of comparing drive, comparing plans, comparing measures, comparing leadership, and fiercely attacking right-leaning conservative thinking, both inside and outside the meeting. Through such mutual comparison and mutual promotion, counties universally revised their plans so that the backward caught up with the advanced, and the advanced became even more advanced. These new indicators also provided a basis for revising the province's planned targets. On the last day of the conference, Du Zheheng, in his concluding speech, affirmed the achievements of the conference in opposing right-leaning conservatism and promoting production leaps forward again, and on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, announced that the original plan to achieve the agricultural program's grain production targets in three years would be revised to achieve them within one year. The main measures to ensure the realization of the program targets this year are: (1) Vigorously build farmland water conservancy projects, expand paddy fields by 4.5 million mu, and expand irrigated land by 15 million mu; at the same time, focus on flood storage and utilization to vigorously eliminate waterlogging disasters, ensuring that the province's 10.08 million mu of low-lying land is not affected by disasters in the event of a single rainfall of 150 mm; mountainous areas should vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work; this can increase grain production by at least 1.45 million tons; (2) Vigorously tap manure sources and promote various rapid manure-making methods, achieve "full manuring" of all cultivated land this year, and increase fertilizer application area by 18 million mu; the average fertilizer application per mu of cultivated land in the province will increase by more than 1,000 jin, which can increase grain production by 780,000 tons; (3) Expand the area of high-yield crops, increase corn planting by 9 million mu, and increase potato planting by 3 million mu, which can increase grain production by 800,000 tons; (4) Expand the area of multiple cropping and intercropping by 3 million mu, which can increase grain production by 300,000 tons; (5) Reclaim 1.35 million mu of wasteland, which can increase grain production by 150,000 tons.

    辽宁人民的冲天尝试
    全省粮食产量今年达到纲要指标
    本报特约新华社沈阳讯  辽宁省决定在今年之内实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）产粮指标。要求今年全省粮食总产量计划由原订八百万吨提高到一千万吨，争取达到一千三百万吨。保证完成的一千万吨数字，比大丰收的1956年增产31.5％。全省五十个县、市中，有三十九个县、市计划今年达到和超过黄河以南亩产五百斤的指标；有十个县、市要达到亩产四百斤的指标。这一规划指标的修订，是在3月2日到7日举行的辽宁省农村工作会议上做出的。
    会议第一天，中共辽宁省委书记、省长杜者蘅在“苦战三年，改变全省面貌”的报告中，代表省委曾提出三年超额实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的产粮指标的要求。随后，参加会议的地委、县委书记便以“敢于作冲天尝试”（列宁语）的精神，在会内会外展开了热烈地比干劲、比规划、比措施、比领导、猛攻右倾保守思想的活动。经过这样互相比较和互相促进，各县普遍修订规划使落后的赶上了先进，先进的更先进。这些新的指标，也给修订全省的规划指标提供了依据。大会最后一天，杜者蘅在总结发言中肯定了会议反对右倾保守、促进生产跃进再跃进的成就，并代表省委宣布把原订三年实现农业纲要产粮指标的规划，修订为一年内实现。保证今年实现纲要指标的主要措施是：（一）大修农田水利工程，扩大水稻田四百五十万亩，扩大水浇地一千五百万亩；同时以蓄洪用水为主大力消灭内涝灾害，保证在一次降雨量一百五十公厘的情况下，全省一千零八十万亩涝洼地不受灾；山区要大力开展水土保持工作；至少可增产一百四十五万吨粮；（二）大力挖掘粪源，推广各种快速造粪法，今年实现全部耕地“满粪化”，增加施肥面积一千八百万亩；全省耕地平均每亩施肥量增加一千斤以上，共可增产七十八万吨粮；（三）扩大高产作物面积，增种玉米九百万亩，增种薯类三百万亩，可增产八十万吨粮；（四）扩大复种套种面积三百万亩，可增产三十万吨粮；（五）复耕撩荒地一百三十五万亩，可增产十五万吨粮。
