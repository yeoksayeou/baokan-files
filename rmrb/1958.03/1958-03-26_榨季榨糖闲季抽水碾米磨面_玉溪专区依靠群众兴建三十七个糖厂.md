This newspaper reports: According to the Yunnan Daily, Yuxi Prefecture, relying on the masses and self-reliance, has newly built thirty-seven small-scale mechanized sugar factories with a daily crushing capacity of 20 tons in Yuanjiang, Xinping, and other five counties, solving the sugarcane processing problem for the entire prefecture, accumulating funds for the state, and training technical cadres.

Last year, Yuxi Prefecture planted more than 43,000 mu of sugarcane, producing more than 35 million jin annually. The existing indigenous sugar pressing methods could no longer meet the needs of sugar production. Building larger sugar factories posed problems with funding, equipment, and technical expertise that could not be resolved immediately. Therefore, it was decided to build small-scale mechanized sugar factories. Employees of the Yuxi Farm Implement Factory were responsible for designing and manufacturing the small-scale sugar cane crushers with a daily crushing capacity of 20 tons. These machines are lightweight and flexible, easily transportable by a horse-drawn carriage, and the operating technology is relatively simple. The sugar extraction rate is above 10%, about 2% higher than indigenous pressing methods, and the quality of the sugar is also better. Each of these small-scale mechanized sugar factories, calculated on the basis of 120 days per year, can process 2,400 tons of sugarcane, equivalent to the output of more than 600 mu of land, increasing efficiency by more than five times compared to indigenous pressing methods, greatly saving rural labor. The greatest advantage of this type of small-scale mechanized sugar factory is its ability to adapt to inconvenient transportation conditions, enabling sugar factories to be widely distributed in rural areas and integrated with production areas.

These thirty-seven small-scale mechanized sugar factories were jointly built by Yuxi Prefecture and agricultural cooperatives. The bank loaned 150,000 yuan to the Yuxi Farm Implement Factory to manufacture machinery. The construction of factory buildings was supported by a small amount of state investment, with agricultural cooperatives providing labor. The buildings were simple, ensuring safety and protection from wind and rain. As a result, the infrastructure construction and installation took only about two months.

Some sugar factories in Yuxi Prefecture have adopted diversified operations, using the power equipment of the sugar factories for water pumping, rice milling, flour grinding, and sawing wood, greatly increasing the utilization rate of the equipment, and ensuring the year-round production of employees. In addition to five fixed employees, each small-scale mechanized sugar factory draws surplus labor from agricultural cooperatives as temporary workers during the pressing season, with some adopting the form of processing for the agricultural cooperatives. This not only eliminates the need for sugar factories to fix too much labor but also increases the non-agricultural income of agricultural cooperatives.

    榨季榨糖闲季抽水碾米磨面
    玉溪专区依靠群众兴建三十七个糖厂
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：玉溪专区依靠群众，自力更生，在元江、新平等五县新建了日榨二十吨的小型机榨糖厂三十七个，解决了全区的甘蔗加工问题，并为国家积累了资金，培养了技术干部。
    玉溪专区去年种植了甘蔗四万三千多亩，年产三千五百多万斤。原有土榨已不能满足榨糖需要，要建设较大的糖厂，资金、设备和技术力量等问题一时又无法解决。于是决定新建小型机榨糖厂。玉溪农具厂职工负责设计制造日榨二十吨的小型榨糖机。这种机器轻巧灵便，一部马车就可运走，操作技术也比较简单，出糖率在10％以上，比土榨提高2％左右，糖的质量也比较好。这种小型机榨糖厂每个厂每年以一百二十天计算，可处理甘蔗二千四百吨，约合六百多亩田的产量，比土榨效率提高五倍以上，大大节约了农村劳动力。这种小型机榨糖厂最大的优点是能够适应交通不便的状况，使榨糖厂广布于农村，与产地结合起来。
    这三十七个小型机榨糖厂是玉溪专区与农业社联合建设的，由银行贷款十五万元给玉溪农具厂造机器，厂房修建由国家出少量投资，农业社出劳动力，盖的都是简易厂房，只要能保证安全、能避风雨就行。结果基建和安装只花了两个月左右时间。
    玉溪专区有些糖厂采取了多种经营的办法，利用糖厂的动力设备搞抽水、碾米、磨面和锯木加工等，使设备利用率大大提高，职工全年的生产也得到了安排。每个小型机榨糖厂除只固定五个职工外，榨季由农业社抽调副业劳动力到糖厂做临时工，有的采取给农业社加工的形式。这样既可免除糖厂固定过多的劳动力，又可增加农业社的副业收入。
