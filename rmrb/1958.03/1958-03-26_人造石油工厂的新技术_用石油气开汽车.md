New Technology in Synthetic Petroleum Plants
Using Liquefied Petroleum Gas to Power Cars

    This newspaper reports: Employees of Liaoning Petroleum Factory No. 6 have successfully used newly manufactured liquefied petroleum gas to power cars.

    This factory produces a large amount of gas during the production of synthetic petroleum. In the past, these gases were discharged into the air through large pipelines, resulting in sheer waste. The annual loss amounted to 5 to 6 million yuan in value. During this anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the factory, based on Soviet suggestions and employee opinions, listed this issue as one of the ten major topics for rectification work and concentrated manpower to research and resolve it.

    Engineering and technical personnel and workers recovered these gases, used air compressors to increase the gas density, and cooled them. They then became a liquid – known as liquefied petroleum gas. The quality of this liquid is even better than that of good domestic gasoline. Its fuel consumption is lower than that of gasoline, and its cost is about half that of gasoline. Another advantage is that it has less of a diluting effect on motor oil (the essential lubricating oil in cars). Motor oil needs to be added only after an average of 24,000 kilometers of driving. Thus, it causes less wear on the cylinders of car engines and can extend the engine's service life.

    To use this liquefied petroleum gas, only a steel cylinder (for pressure resistance) and a pressure reducer (to prevent the liquefied petroleum gas from evaporating) need to be added to a regular car.

### 人造石油工厂的新技术  用石油气开汽车

    人造石油工厂的新技术
    用石油气开汽车
    本报讯　辽宁石油六厂职工用新近制造的液化石油气开汽车成功。
    这个工厂在生产人造石油过程中，产生大量气体。过去这些气体都是由大管道排散在空间，白白浪费掉。每年这项损失价值达五、六百万元。在这次反浪费反保守运动中，工厂根据苏联建议和职工意见，将这一问题列为整改工作的十大课题之一，集中人力加以研究解决。
    工程技术人员和工人们把这些气体回收，用空气压缩机加大气体密度并加以冷却后，它们便成为液体——被称为液化石油气。这种液体比国内好汽油的质量还好，耗油量比汽油省，成本也低一半左右；另一优点是它对机油（汽车上必需的润滑油）的冲淡作用小，平均行驶两万四千公里后始需添一次机油，因而对汽车发动机的汽缸磨损较小，可延长发动机使用寿命。
    采用这种液化石油气，在一般汽车上只需附加一个钢瓶（起耐压作用）和一个减压器（防止液化石油气挥发）就可以了。
