Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The Second Platoon, Second Company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and its platoon leader Guo Yunfeng, who advocated saving 78% of cleaning cloth, were recently awarded by the unit's leading organs. Guo Yunfeng was promoted from deputy squad leader (lower-ranking sergeant) to full squad leader (middle-ranking sergeant); the Second Platoon was collectively awarded a Second Class Merit, and received the "Thrift Vanguard" flag. After their proposal was promoted throughout the army, it can save a large amount of cotton cloth for the country every year.

Guo Yunfeng wove cloth for three years before joining the army. After he was transferred to the Second Platoon as platoon leader in March 1957, he and the soldiers worked together to study ways to save cleaning cloth, using new cloth where new cloth was needed, and old cloth where old cloth was needed. They also washed and stored the used cloth after each cleaning so that it could be reused next time. During the "Double-Anti" movement, he and all the soldiers, after repeated experiments, and with the help of people sent by the unit's leading organs to summarize experience, proposed to reduce the current supply standard of cleaning cloth by at least 78%. This proposal was valued by Chief of the General Political Department General Tan Zheng and other responsible comrades, and is being promoted in the artillery units of the entire army.

    节约擦炮布百分之七十八
    解放军“节约尖兵”受奖
    新华社27日讯　倡议节约擦炮布78％的中国人民解放军某高射炮部队二连二班和班长郭云凤，最近受到了部队领导机关的奖励：郭云凤由副班级下士晋为正班级中士；二班集体立二等功，并荣获“节约尖兵”奖旗一面。他们的倡议在全军推广以后，每年可以为国家节约大量棉布。
    郭云凤在入伍前织过三年布。他从1957年3月调到二班任班长后，就和战士们共同研究节约擦炮布的办法，该用新布的地方用新布，该用旧布的地方用旧布，而且每次把擦过炮的旧布洗好保管起来，以便下次再用。在双反运动中，他和全班战士经过反复试验，并由部队领导机关派人帮助总结经验，提出了擦炮布至少降低现行供给标准78％的倡议。这一倡议受到总政治部主任谭政大将等负责同志的重视，正在全军炮兵部队中推广。
