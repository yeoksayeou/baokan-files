Across the River, Two Different Moods
Jin Zhongnan, Advanced Producer of the Beijing Train Section, Beijing Outstanding Youth Worker

These days, from Pyongyang to Andong, everywhere our train passes—the Sino-Korean through train—is a scene of celebration. But the faces of the people at both ends of the Yalu River Bridge, which connects the two countries, reveal different expressions: reluctance on that side, and eager anticipation on this side. What Korean would willingly part with the most beloved people? What Chinese would not want to see their most outstanding sons and daughters sooner?

When the train speeds across Korean territory, we can see the Korean people and the volunteers everywhere in the fields; they are building and working, rebuilding homes for the Korean people at the speed of the train.

In Korea, we personally saw how Korean old women treated the volunteers with the care and affection of a son; we also saw the volunteers holding children who had lost their parents, raising them as if they were their own.

Think about it, how could the Korean people not be attached to these most beloved people?

Think about it, how could the Chinese people not miss these most beloved people?

These days, our hearts are filled with the complex feelings of the people of both countries. As soon as the train enters Korean territory, I think that the most beloved people should stay in Korea for a few more days; as soon as the train enters the motherland's territory, I look forward to the most beloved people returning sooner.

However, one feeling never changes: the heroic deeds of the volunteers have always inspired us to move forward. Currently, the train section has proposed a challenge to all train sections across the country, guaranteeing to improve work quality, eliminate errors, and warmly serve passengers. We must exert the greatest enthusiasm and creativity, and continuously improve the quality of our work to welcome our most beloved people.

    一江之隔　两样心情
    北京列车段先进生产者　北京市青年优秀工作者  金重男
    这几天，从平壤到安东，在我们的列车——中朝联运列车经过的地方，到处是一片节日的景象。但连接两国的鸭绿江大桥两端的人们的脸上却流露着不同的神情：那边是依依不舍，这边是望眼欲穿。朝鲜人民那个愿意和最可爱的人分离？中国人民那个不想快点看到自己最优秀的儿女？
    当列车在朝鲜国土上奔驰的时候，我们可以看到田野里遍地是朝鲜人民和志愿军；在建设着，劳动着，他们以火车奔驰的速度，在为朝鲜人民重建家园。
    在朝鲜，我们亲眼看到朝鲜老大娘们对待志愿军像儿子一样关怀和亲切；我们也看到志愿军抱着失去父母的孩子，像对待自己的子女一样抚养他们。
    想想吧，朝鲜人民怎么不依恋这些最可爱的人呢？
    想想吧，中国人民怎么不想念这些最可爱的人呢？
    这几天，在我们的胸怀里就交织着两国人民的复杂的心情。列车一进入朝鲜国境，我就想最可爱的人应该在朝鲜多留几天；列车一进入祖国国境，我就盼望着最可爱的人早点回来。
    但是，有一种心情是始终不会变的：志愿军的英勇事迹，一直在鼓舞着我们前进。目前列车段提出向全国各个列车段挑战，保证提高工作质量，消灭差错，热心为旅客服务。我们要发挥最大的积极性和创造精神，不断提高工作质量，来欢迎我们最可爱的人。
