What Kind of "News," What Kind of "New Path"?
    Li Xifan

    I.
    Perhaps it seems a bit outdated to bring up again this anti-Party special feature "Internal News of This Newspaper" (note), which is widely recognized as such, after the anti-Rightist struggle and after thoroughly exposing the Rightist face of Liu Binyan, this "special feature expert." However, after reading the "Re-Criticism" special issue of "Wenyi Bao" ("Literary Gazette"), I deeply feel that an anti-Party element dared to be so arrogant, and his anti-Party works could receive applause from some people, which is by no means an isolated phenomenon. It must be closely related to the ideological trends of the times. The joint anti-Party activities of the counter-revolutionary Wang Shiwei and the anti-Party element Ding Ling, etc., were like this, and Liu Binyan is no exception.
    If Liu Binyan's first special feature "On the Bridge Construction Site" did not express his anti-Party sentiments very clearly, then "Internal News of This Newspaper" clearly reveals strong anti-Party sentiments and should be seen through at a glance. However, this kind of special feature, represented by it, which supposedly exposes the "dark side of life," formed a fashionable literary style for a period of time. "Renmin Wenxue" ("People's Literature"), a large-scale publication publishing literary works, was its active promoter under the direction of Qin Zhaoyang, and then it spread across the country, causing many people to imitate it. Some writers even believed that Liu Binyan's special features were the "highest achievement" at the time. When this trend became somewhat established, theoretical offensives also appeared publicly under the guise of academic discussions. He Zhi's (i.e., Qin Zhaoyang) "Realism—A Broad Path" and Zhou Bo's "Realism and Its Development in the Socialist Era" were the theoretical founders of this trend. Can all of this be said to be accidental?
    Like Wang Shiwei and Ding Ling, the anti-Party elements and revisionists who stirred up this adverse current are good at seizing opportunities. From April-May to August-September 1956, this adverse current emerged and became active, following the revisionist ideological trend in the international communist movement. These revisionists in Chinese literary thought borrowed the slogans of so-called "interfering in life" and "writing truthfully" to negate and revise the principles of socialist realism. Their first sample was "Internal News of This Newspaper." Qin Zhaoyang, the initiator of this trend, who also played an "organizational" role in this movement, commented: "...This 'Internal News' at least opened up a new path for our creation, and began to make writers pay attention to and describe the depths of people's souls in our surrounding life, and not just pay attention to workers and peasants. Moreover, this is not ordinary attention and description, but 'excavation.' That is to say, you are opening up a new path of your own realism, and at the same time setting an example for others. What a significant meaning this has!" It can be seen how important they regarded this work! Therefore, as we are conducting debates with revisionists today, it cannot be said to be outdated to settle this old score with "Internal News of This Newspaper."
    What is the main content of this work? It develops its story through the struggle between Huang Jiaying and Chen Lidong. The content of this struggle is concentrated in two different approaches to running the newspaper. In Liu Binyan's writing, "New Light Daily" is controlled by Chen Lidong, the conservative editor-in-chief. He only executes the instructions of the provincial party committee and does not dare to truthfully reflect the lives and opinions of the masses. Huang Jiaying's approach to running the newspaper is completely the opposite. She advocates that the newspaper should "interfere in life," break away from the leadership of the Party, put the Party in opposition to the masses, and exaggerate the shortcomings in the socialist cause, turning the Party's newspaper into a bourgeois tool for inciting the masses to oppose the Party. In fact, judging from Liu Binyan's anti-Party news viewpoints revealed in the anti-Rightist struggle, Huang Jiaying is merely a mouthpiece for the Rightists in the news media.
    Although the plot takes place in the editorial department of a newspaper, the foundation of the plot extends to a wide range of social life. The Party's propaganda and education weapon—the newspaper—is the most sensitive sense organ of social life. It raises new problems in life every day, reflects newly occurring events and the demands and opinions of the masses, and publicizes the Party's various guidelines and policies to the masses. Therefore, taking "the newspaper" as the background inevitably involves our broad social life. In fact, the reason why Liu Binyan chose this background is precisely to facilitate the use of the so-called "interfering in life" weapon to distort and slander our Party and the entire social life.
    The Party organizations, both high and low, that appear in this special feature, from the provincial Party committee to the Party committee of the Jiawang Mine and the Party branch of "New Light Daily," are either bureaucratic and conservative groups detached from the masses, or are manipulated by "misguided" individuals. The "culprit" is the provincial Party committee. The provincial Party committee in Liu Binyan's writing is filled with mediocre conservatives and bureaucrats who do not understand the actual situation and pressing problems in the lives of the masses. They only know how to issue calls and instructions for "vigorously developing," "resolutely implementing," and "actively responding," restricting the work of "New Light Daily" everywhere, not daring to boldly use cadres, and not daring to launch criticism and self-criticism of the province's work in the newspaper. In order to vilify this provincial Party committee, Liu Binyan does not hesitate to use some completely unconvincing and arbitrarily exaggerated examples to ridicule the leaders of these provincial Party committees. The provincial Party committee member, provincial industrial minister, and director of the industrial department, because the industrial group of "New Light Daily" became a propaganda section of the industrial department, bragging about the achievements of the province's industry all day long, often praised the newspaper to Chen Lidong and praised Zhang Ye, the head of the industrial group. When the newspaper published a reader's letter criticizing the local state-owned factory for producing thermos bottles that were not warm enough, the minister "flew into a rage" at the provincial Party committee meeting. Even the provincial Party secretary chimed in and said, "The newspaper should first affirm the achievements." What kind of "provincial Party committee" is this? Is it not clear enough?
    The Party committee of the Jiawang Mine is even more bureaucratic. They are indifferent to the suffering of the workers and have not been able to solve the problem of too many mass meetings for a long time, so they are exploited by the anti-Party element Huang Jiaying, who leads the workers to make a big democratic strike. The cause of this incident, in Liu Binyan's writing, is that there were too many meetings, and workers could only "sleep for four hours" for several years.
    The phenomenon of too many meetings does exist. The thing of only sleeping four hours a day may have happened for a short time. However, Liu Binyan's description is clearly malicious exaggeration. Miners can only sleep for four hours every day and continue for several years, and they can "live forever." Is this reasonable? Similar malicious exaggerations are found everywhere in "Internal News of This Newspaper." For example, a Party municipal committee made a decision to eliminate all sparrows in the city within seven days, etc., which are all completely lacking in authenticity, but Liu Binyan uses them to attack the Party's work.
    The Party branch of "New Light Daily" is even worse. In fact, it is not a Party organization, but only a tool for enhancing and guaranteeing personal prestige that has been manipulated by Chen Lidong for a long time. The two deputy editors-in-chief had to automatically request to transfer their jobs simply because they had criticized Chen Lidong at the branch meeting or did not get along with him. Moreover, it seems that people's Party membership issues must also be decided by Chen Lidong's approval. As for the other members of this branch, except for Cao Mengfei and Li Heqing, the two sympathizers of Huang Jiaying, who are positive figures affirmed by the author, most of them are moldy and smelly dregs of the times.
    We are not saying that there will be no mistakes in certain departments of the Party, or even in the work of the provincial Party committee. Nor are we saying that there will be no conservatives or bureaucrats among the leaders of certain departments in our Party. Even less are we saying that if there are such people and things, writers are not allowed to describe them. On the contrary, we urgently need very sharp critical works to conduct enthusiastic and active criticism of the shortcomings and errors of revolutionary work, and of bureaucrats and conservatives. We believe that such works are very helpful in promoting the progress and development of revolutionary work, and helping revolutionary cadres to get rid of officialdom, overcome shortcomings, and correct mistakes. The masses welcome writers' critical literary creations. No one in the world understands the meaning of criticism better than the Communist Party. The question is not whether we can describe the shortcomings in our work and life, but from what standpoint and for what purpose we describe them. Obviously, Liu Binyan's creation is deliberately distorting and vilifying the work of our Party, Party life, and the image of Party members. In Liu Binyan's mind, the entire Communist Party is the world of Chen Lidong, Ma Wenyuan, and Zhang Ye. In his words: "Above is a group of conservative forces—the 'privileged class' of senior cadres, in the middle is a group of 'local emperors' who outwardly obey but inwardly oppose—the leading cadres of the provincial and municipal levels are in control, and below is a group of ignorant 'idiots.'" "Some people are stupid, old-fashioned, ignorant, and hinder the progress of life! Some people's political enthusiasm has declined, they are tired and sluggish, and do nothing or are greedy for pleasure! Others are selfish, cowardly, dare not speak, are afraid of losing their official hats, and dare not uphold the interests of the Party!" Wearing such poisonous tinted glasses to look at our lives, how can he hope to find anything positive and real?

    II.
    Now let us study the images of Chen Lidong and Ma Wenyuan, the main characters in "Internal News of This Newspaper." Liu Binyan uses his dark thoughts to shape artistic images, to vilify the Party, vilify the Party's leaders, and instill his anti-Party thoughts into readers.
    "Ma Wenyuan is the son of a small clerk. All the property he inherited from his father is an intellectual's bookish integrity," but the first change in this upright person after joining the Party is that his spirit becomes "tired." Liberation has made his enthusiasm decline. In the work assigned to him by the Party, he "chose the simplest way of working: passing on instructions from above and reporting below, turning the minister's instructions into his own instructions, and turning the reports of the staff into his own reports." And "in the sharp, complex, and ever-changing struggle," what he gained was "the most general and abstract things. He has mastered some concepts and formulas that he calls 'laws,' summarizing any complex phenomenon into them, or applying them to any event, thinking that he can deal with them easily." In order to strengthen the explanation of Ma Wenyuan's process of spiritual decline, Liu Binyan does not hesitate to use the most abstract words and mock a Communist Party member's position and principles of understanding problems with hostility, saying that "the colorful events in life are just illustrations of the life rules that Ma Wenyuan thinks he has already understood, and people's joys, anger, sorrow, and happiness cannot be separated from the three laws of 'class stand,' 'outlook on life,' and 'work style.'"
    In this way, Ma Wenyuan's revolutionary will and spirit were exhausted by four years of work in the Party committee organs. He "lost interest in the broader field of life" and shrunk into the shell of philistinism.
    However, Ma Wenyuan doesn't hope to cheer himself up? Is he satisfied with "his old ways!" When he "stepped into the gate of the newspaper from the Party committee organs," Ma Wenyuan also dreamed of changing himself in the new environment. However, this dream was shattered. In order to give his editor-in-chief office director a warning, Chen Lidong, who was swift and resolute, "made people suspect not their own shortcomings, but the size of the value of their own existence," dictated the content of three editorials to Ma Wenyuan, "but none of the three editorials were published," and he was publicly criticized at the meeting. "From then on, Ma Wenyuan became more silent." He obeyed Chen Lidong's will in everything and "learned to think according to the thoughts of editor-in-chief Chen Lidong." "The days of calm and tranquility began again. There was no argument, no quarrel, and no major event for Ma Wenyuan to decide." Ma Wenyuan's hope for the rebirth of his revolutionary spirit was destroyed. Only under the "new situation" where "Huang Jiaying's voice kept ringing in front of Ma Wenyuan" did Ma Wenyuan be forced to embark on a new period of contradiction. So, he wavered between Chen Lidong and Huang Jiaying, and gradually understood the new "truth of life" that "how happy it is for a person to have his own opinions," stood with Huang Jiaying and "thought independently," transitioned from a Communist Party member to the other shore of individualism, and joined Huang Jiaying's party. Only then did Ma Wenyuan find the true destination of "rebirth."
    The description of Ma Wenyuan is indeed very "vivid." However, as long as people think deeply about it, they cannot help but be angered by the insidious intentions of the author hidden in these descriptions. The image of Ma Wenyuan, Ma Wenyuan's life path, only tells people such a "truth": A person joins the Communist Party, not to find a true and lofty ideal, a firm path in life, and contribute his life and strength to the people, the country, and mankind, but to have his will and spirit constantly destroyed, until he completely loses his vitality and becomes a soft worm. This is the life path that the Party arranges for a Party member!
    In Liu Binyan's writing, Ma Wenyuan's life path is like this, but isn't Chen Lidong, who destroyed his life confidence, also a person who has gone through the same experience! The so-called "Chen Lidong's badness" lies in his dictatorial conservatism. However, doesn't this editor-in-chief have his own thoughts and his own will! It's just that in his twenty years of Party membership, his own thoughts and will have been destroyed in the revolutionary process earlier than Ma Wenyuan. His actions to destroy Ma Wenyuan's life confidence are nothing more than a reprint of "a daughter-in-law who has been a daughter-in-law for many years becomes a mother-in-law."
    After a conversation between Huang Jiaying and Chen Lidong, the dictatorial and arbitrary Chen Lidong also had a painful inner monologue!
    Is it the heavy contempt cast in Huang Jiaying's eyes? Or is it the self-confidence that Chen Lidong rarely hears in her voice that made Chen Lidong feel uneasy for a long time. His self-esteem struggled, struggled, and almost led his consciousness to this thought:
    "Twenty years ago, I was no worse than you!"
    This thought startled him, and he immediately remembered that when he was twenty-five years old, he often argued with people. When he was thirty-two years old, he still retained some independent views. When he became more mature and sophisticated, he became more unwilling to express and often gave up his own views. At the age of forty-two, he became a completely different person.
    "But," his thoughts continued, "as long as the provincial Party committee agrees, I can run this newspaper so that everyone loves to read it and everyone praises it! As long as the provincial Party committee agrees..."
    It would be ridiculous to think that this inner monologue's psychological description is expressing that the physiological increase in age has "rusted" Chen Lidong's "soul." In Liu Binyan's writing, the reason why Chen Lidong became today's Chen Lidong is not his responsibility. It is the "revolutionary crucible" that led him to such a life path. Similarly, the reason why the newspaper is not run well is not Chen Lidong's conservative dictatorship, but above Chen Lidong, there is the "local emperor" provincial Party committee that Liu Binyan hates even more, which is more conservative and dictatorial.
    For intellectuals, our Party is indeed a great revolutionary crucible, but it is not to melt away their revolutionary enthusiasm, nor to melt away the individual talents and independent opinions under the brilliance of collectivism. On the contrary, it is to raise this enthusiasm, talent, and independent opinions to the highest level of communists so that they can play a greater role in the communist cause. This is the path that many revolutionary intellectuals and even many outstanding leaders in the Party have taken together. Of course, the Party's crucible does indeed have to melt away some things on intellectuals, that is, the bourgeois things formed by their origins and upbringing—individualism and anarchism. A conscious communist fighter regards throwing away these burdens as the glory of becoming a revolutionary. Only Liu Binyan and Huang Jiaying regard the revolutionary crucible as a "terrible fire pit."
    The Communist Party is a "materialist" and never avoids facts. Among some of our Party members, and even among the leaders of certain departments, there are phenomena of arbitrariness and dictatorialism, and there are also people whose revolutionary spirit has declined. The Party is constantly carrying out struggles of criticism, education, and transformation against these people. The rectification movements carried out by the Party many times are the most powerful explanation. Therefore, the Party will also warmly welcome artists to paint portraits for them, so as to educate the broad cadres and people. However, these have nothing to do with Liu Binyan. What the Rightist Liu Binyan deeply hates is not bureaucracy or conservatism, nor is it spiritual decline or enthusiasm decline, but the Party. What he cares about is not how these comrades who have made mistakes can correct their mistakes and shortcomings. What he is most enthusiastic about is exaggerating these mistakes and shortcomings and saying that they are incurable bad people, the inevitable products of the social system. Through the image of Ma Wenyuan and Chen Lidong—whether it is spiritual decline or dictatorial conservatism—what Liu Binyan wants to tell people is that the root of all these evils lies not in the individual's life path or individual qualities, but in the inevitable tragedy of the Party guiding them onto the revolutionary path, and the spiritual tragedy caused by the "iron hoop" of Party life on Party members. In short, in Liu Binyan's writing, the Party is the destroyer of human nature, the source of dictatorial conservatism, and the Party has become a dictatorial and repressive conservative group that is not guiding people forward, but hindering the progress of life. The banner of communism is no longer in the hands of the Party. This is the "artistic agitation" that Qin Zhaoyang praised in Liu Binyan, and the true content of the "soul" "excavation" that Liu Binyan carried out through the artistic images of Ma Wenyuan and Chen Lidong.
    Since the Communist Party cannot hold up the banner of communism, then, in Liu Binyan's view, who is the holder of the banner of communism? That is the anti-Party figures like Huang Jiaying.
    Huang Jiaying is the new force and hero in Liu Binyan's writing. She is indeed dressed in a charming appearance. She is not only eye-catching with her rich and colorful demeanor, but also intoxicates many young people with her active, enthusiastic, and "contemptuous of everything that constantly demands innovation" behavior. She also guides people like Ma Wenyuan out of the "mud pit" of spiritual decline and onto the "right" path in life.
    However, what kind of charming content does this heroine Huang Jiaying's character in Liu Binyan's writing have?
    Huang Jiaying, 25, is just a reporter with three years of interviewing history. She dares to despise everything. In her interviewing process, she puts the Party's guidelines and policies aside. She has her own "independent thinking" on any issue. Her interviews are not for reporting objectively on events that have happened, but only to "arrange facts and organize materials to most powerfully explain her own thoughts." The life she sees in her interviewing process is only darkness and shortcomings. She is dissatisfied with Chen Lidong's leadership, and is actually dissatisfied with the provincial Party committee's leadership. She wants to break away from the provincial Party committee's propaganda intentions at all times and do her own thing. She is especially against reporting on the achievements in our work. She even incites and participates in workers' strikes at the Jiawang Mine, making a big democratic protest against the Party. In short, she is in opposition to the Party in all her work. Look at her attitude of despising everything: "...Whenever she thinks of Chen Lidong, and thinks of her bowing her head and admitting her guilt in front of Chen Lidong, a smile appears on the corner of her mouth. It's the smile of a person when he despises a threat: 'Speak my opinions, my views.'" In her mind, there is no Party or leadership. She is expanding herself in all aspects. However, Liu Binyan describes this "hero" whose whole body is permeated with anti-Party sentiments as a youth league member who actively asks to join the Party. Why is this? This is the key to all of Liu Binyan's thoughts in writing this work. The Rightist Liu Binyan regards himself as a "reformer." He once attempted to turn the "Youth League into a second Party" and use this second Party to transform our Party. The image of Huang Jiaying is precisely the embodiment of this reactionary thought. In Huang Jiaying, Liu Binyan places his own "ideals." "Internal News of This Newspaper" ends with a bright tail that Liu Binyan hopes for. In the struggle between Huang Jiaying and Chen Lidong, Huang Jiaying is the victor. This is prominently expressed at the branch meeting discussing Huang Jiaying's admission to the Party. Only a few individuals publicly oppose Huang Jiaying's admission to the Party, and they are isolated. Those who agree with her admission to the Party occupy the majority. Among the people who agree, there are not only Cao Mengfei, Li Heqing, Zhang Ye, and Ma Wenyuan, but also Chen Lidong. This is a picture hinting that the Party is "surrendering" to Huang Jiaying. This victorious ending clearly embodies Liu Binyan's arrogant dream—to transform our Party with Huang Jiaying's thoughts and Huang Jiaying's line.
    However, no matter how Liu Binyan embellishes and beautifies his "hero," Huang Jiaying's series of anti-Party actions have nothing in common with communists, but are extremely arrogant individualists. The independent thinking and rebellious character of Huang Jiaying that Liu Binyan beautifies are based on despising everything, being self-centered, betraying the Party, and betraying socialism as her center of activities. The Party that Huang Jiaying wants is an individualist Party, an anarchist Party. If the Chinese revolution were led by Huang Jiaying's Party, it could only lead to the destruction of socialism and the restoration of capitalism. Huang Jiaying's "Party" once tested its strength during the period of great contending and blooming, wearing the cloak of a reformer. But unfortunately, it did not achieve the "victory" that Liu Binyan hoped for. In the face of highly conscious people, they only played an ugly drama of "mayflies shaking a big tree." However, it is not useless for Liu Binyan to leave readers with such a "vivid artistic image." Poisonous weeds can become fertilizer. The vivid sequel of Huang Jiaying and others in real life can "indeed educate the people to understand how our enemies work. Those whose noses are blocked can open up, and young or old people who are innocent and know nothing about the world can quickly learn a lot about the world." ("Editor's Note" of "Wenyi Bao" ("Literary Gazette"), Issue 2, 1958)

    III.
    The "new path of realism" of Liu Binyan that Qin Zhaoyang praised is very clear here. The essential content—to "excavate" from the "soul"—is nothing more than to vilify the Party and beautify individualism from the depths of people's souls, so as to achieve their common goal of inciting anti-Party activities. The content of this "new path of realism" is nothing more than a vivid footnote to the "interfering in life" and "writing truthfully" that Qin Zhaoyang has repeatedly elaborated in his articles such as "Talking about the Authenticity of Special Features" and "Realism—A Broad Path." In "Internal News of This Newspaper," there is indeed no trace of Qin Zhaoyang's so-called "one-sided praise of the bright side" of socialism, and it is a mess without any light at all. Liu Binyan also "does not look at life with a secular eye, but with a deep eye." The characters he describes also have "unique and even extremely special destinies." However, facts prove that this is not a "new path of realism," but a reactionary path that is anti-realism. It is sinking into the mud pit of so-called "interfering in life," "writing truthfully," and exposing the dark side, vilifying our Party and our social life with a subjective spirit permeated with hostility to socialism without any authenticity. However, it is not just "criticism" and "exposure." It is also praising, and praising with all its strength. However, what it praises is only Huang Jiaying's anti-Party activities. This is the sample of "Realism—A Broad Path." The position hidden behind "interfering in life" and "writing truthfully" is exposed here. However, using this sample as the soul's banner, during the period when Qin Zhaoyang was the editor-in-chief of "Renmin Wenxue" ("People's Literature"), how much hard work was put in to build this "new path of realism" or "Realism—A Broad Path!" "The Person Climbing the Flagpole," "The Fall of Ma Duan," "The Besieged Farm Chairman," "Re-election," and a series of short essays and miscellaneous articles were all the weapons equipped to build this "new path." Therefore, in the adverse current of this trend of thought, not only are the anti-Party and anti-socialist positions of these authors exposed, but also the hypocritical face of the "theoretician" Qin Zhaoyang is torn apart. What was originally covered up under the cloak of doubting the imprecise definition of socialist realism is just to open up such a "new path of realism" for Liu Binyan and others. As long as we examine them together, we will not find it difficult to discover what kind of flesh-and-blood relationship exists between this revisionist adverse current in literary thought and the Rightist cold current during the period of great contending and blooming!

    Note: Published in the June and October 1956 issues of "Renmin Wenxue" ("People's Literature"), and later combined with his "On the Bridge Construction Site," published by the Workers' Publishing House, titled "Internal News."

    什么样的“消息”，什么样的“新路”？
    李希凡
    一
    在反右派斗争以后，在彻底揭露了刘宾雁这个“特写专家”的右派嘴脸以后，重新提起这篇公认的反党特写“本报内部消息”来（注），或许有些过时了。但是，当我看过了“文艺报”的“再批判”特辑，深深地感到，一个反党分子所以敢于这样嚣张，他的反党作品所以能够受到某些人的喝采，这决不是一个孤立的现象，它必然和时代思想潮流有密切的关联。反革命分子王实味和反党分子丁玲等的联合反党是如此，刘宾雁也并不例外。
    如果说刘宾雁的第一篇特写“在桥梁工地上”的反党情绪表现得还不很明显，那么，“本报内部消息”是显然流露着浓厚的反党情绪的，应该可以一眼看穿的了。可是，以它为代表的这种所谓揭露“生活阴暗面”的特写，在一个时期里却形成了一种时髦的文体。发表文学创作的大型刊物“人民文学”在秦兆阳的主持下曾经是它的积极的提倡者，然后是流毒全国，引起了不少人的模仿。甚至有的作家认为刘宾雁的特写，是目前“最高的东西”。而当这种倾向略具规模以后，理论上的攻势，也就披着学术讨论的外衣公开出现了。何直（即秦兆阳）的“现实主义——广阔的道路”，周勃的“现实主义及其在社会主义时代的发展”，就是这种倾向的理论上的奠基人。这一切难道能说是偶然的吗？
    和王实味、丁玲等一样，掀起这股逆流的反党分子和修正主义者们，是善于利用时机的。从1956年4、5月到8、9月，这股逆流从冒头到活跃，是追随着国际共产主义运动中的修正主义思潮出现的。中国的这些文学思想上的修正主义者，借用所谓“干预生活”、“写真实”的口号，来否定并修正社会主义现实主义原则。他们的第一篇样品就是“本报内部消息”。它们的首倡者，也是在这个运动里起了“组织”作用的秦兆阳这样评价道：“……这篇‘内部消息’，至少是给我们的创作开始打开了一条新路，开始使作家们去注意，去描写我们周围生活中人们的灵魂深处，而不仅去注意那些工人农民。而且这不是普通的注意和描写，而是‘挖掘’。这就是说，你在开辟一条自己的现实主义的新路，同时也在给别人作出榜样来。这有何等重大的意义呀！”可见他们把这篇作品看得多么重！因此，在我们和修正主义者进行辩论的今天，就“本报内部消息”来清算一下这笔旧账，也就不能说是过时了。
  什么是这篇作品的主要内容呢？它是通过黄佳英和陈立栋的斗争来发展它的故事的。这个斗争的内容集中地表现在两条不同的办报路线上。在刘宾雁的笔下，“新光日报”是把持在总编辑保守主义者陈立栋的手里。他只是执行省委指示，不敢真实地反映群众的生活、群众的意见。而黄佳英的办报路线却完全相反，她主张报纸要“干预生活”，要脱离党的领导，把党和群众对立起来，主张要夸大社会主义事业中的缺点，使党的报纸变成煽动群众反党的资产阶级的工具。实际上从反右派斗争中揭露出来的刘宾雁的反党的新闻观点来看，黄佳英不过是新闻界的右派的传声筒。
    故事情节虽然是发生在一个报纸的编辑部里，而情节的基础却伸展到广泛的社会生活领域里。党的宣传教育武器——报纸，这是社会生活最敏锐的感官，它每天提出生活中的新问题，反映生活中新发生的事件和群众的要求和意见，并向群众宣传党的各项方针和政策。因此，以“报纸”为背景，就不能不涉及到我们广阔的社会生活，实际上刘宾雁所以选择这个背景，也正是为了便于使用所谓“干预生活”的武器，来歪曲和诽谤我们的党和整个社会生活。
    在这特写里出现的上上下下的党组织，从党的省委，到贾王矿的党委会，“新光日报”的党支部，不是脱离群众的官僚保守集团，就是操纵在个人手里的“迷失方向”的人。“罪魁祸首”是省委。刘宾雁笔下的这个省委充塞着庸庸碌碌的保守主义者，官僚主义者，他们不了解群众生活中的实际情况和迫切问题，只知道发布“大力开展”、“坚决贯彻”、“积极响应”的号召和指示，处处限制“新光日报”的工作，不敢大胆放手地使用干部，也不敢在报纸上展开对于本省工作的批评和自我批评。为了丑化这个省委，刘宾雁不惜用一些完全不能令人信服的任意夸张的事例，来嘲笑这些省委的领导人。省委委员、省委工业部长兼工业厅长，因为“新光日报”的工业组变成了工业厅的一个宣传科，整天吹嘘本省工业的成就，就经常向陈立栋夸几句报纸，称赞几句工业组长张野，而当报纸发表了一篇读者来信批评地方国营工厂生产的暖水瓶不够保暖，这位部长就在省委会议上“大发雷霆”了。连省委书记也跟着帮腔说：“报纸应该首先肯定成就”。这是一个什么样的“省委”，难道还不够清楚吗？
    贾王矿的党委会更是官僚主义到了极点。他们对于工人的疾苦漠不关心，长期不能解决群众会议多的问题，以致被反党分子黄佳英所利用，领导工人闹了罢会的大民主。这次事件的起因在刘宾雁的笔下，是由于开会多，有好几年工人只能“睡四个钟头觉”造成的。
    会议多的现象确实是有。一天只能睡四个小时的事情，在短的时间里，也可能有过。但是，刘宾雁的这种描写，却显然是恶意的夸张。矿工每天都只能睡四小时，一直继续了好几年，居然能够“长生不死”，难道这是合乎情理的吗？类似这样恶意夸张的描写，在“本报内部消息”里，俯拾皆是。例如什么一个党市委作出七天之内消灭全市麻雀的决定等等，都是一种完全缺乏真实性的事例，刘宾雁却以此来攻击党的工作。
    “新光日报”的党支部就更糟糕了。实际上已经不是一个党组织而只是长期操纵在陈立栋手里的一个增强和保证个人威信的工具。两个副总编辑只是因为在支部大会上批评过陈立栋，或者是和他合不来，就不得不自动要求调工作。而且似乎人们的入党问题，也要决定于陈立栋的点头与否。至于这个支部的其他党员，除去曹梦飞、李鹤青这两个黄佳英的同情者，是作者所肯定的正面人物以外，大多数都是发霉发臭的时代渣滓。
    我们并不是说党的某些部门，甚至像省委的工作，不会有错误。也不是说，我们党内的某些部门的领导人，不会有保守主义者，官僚主义者。更不是说，有了这种人和事，不允许作家去描写。相反的，我们迫切需要非常尖锐的批评性的作品，对于革命工作的缺点和错误，对于官僚主义者，保守主义者，进行热情的积极的批评，我们相信这样的作品，十分有益于推动革命工作的进步和发展，帮助革命干部打掉官气，克服缺点，纠正错误。群众是欢迎作家的批评性的文艺创作的。世界上再没有谁比共产党更懂得批评的意义了。问题不在于能不能描写我们工作和生活中的缺点，而在于从什么样的立场上和为了什么目的来描写。很显然，刘宾雁的创作是蓄意歪曲和丑化我们党的工作、党内生活、党员形象。在刘宾雁的心目里，整个共产党都是陈立栋、马文元、张野们的天下。用他的话说：“上面是一批保守力量——高级干部的‘特权阶级’，中间是一批阳奉阴违的‘土皇帝’——省市一级党的领导干部在把持，而下面是一群懵然无知的‘笨蛋’。”“一些人愚蠢，守旧，不学无术，阻碍生活前进！一些人政治热情衰退，疲疲塌塌，无所用心或贪图享乐！另一些人自私、懦弱，不敢说话，怕丢乌纱帽，不敢坚持党的利益！”戴着这样阴毒的有色眼镜来看待我们的生活，能希望他找到什么积极的东西和真实的画面呢？
    二
    现在让我们研究一下“本报内部消息”的主要人物陈立栋、马文元的形象。刘宾雁是用他的阴暗的思想来塑造艺术形象，来丑化党，丑化党的领导者，向读者灌输他的反党思想的。
    “马文元是一个小职员的儿子。他从父亲那里继承下来的全部财产，就是一个知识分子书生气的正直”，但是，这个正直的人参加党以后的第一个变化，就是精神“疲塌”。解放使他的热情衰退了。在党交给他的工作里，他“选择了最简单的一种工作方法：承上启下，把部长的指示变成自己的指示，又把科员的报告变成自己的报告”。而“在尖锐复杂、变幻多端的斗争里”，他所得到的，又“是最一般、最抽象的东西。他已经掌握了他自己称之为‘规律’的一些概念和公式，把任何复杂的现象归纳到这里面，或者把它们套在任何事件上，自以为都能应付自如。”为了加强说明马文元这种精神衰退的过程，刘宾雁不惜用最抽象的词句，充满敌意地嘲弄一个共产党员认识问题的立场和原则，说什么“生活里五光十色的事件，不过是马文元自以为早已洞悉的生活规律的插图，人们的喜怒哀乐都离不开‘阶级立场’，‘人生观’与‘思想作风’这三条法则。”
    就这样，马文元的革命意志和精神，被四年的党委机关工作消磨净尽了。他“对更广阔的生活领域失去了兴趣”，萎缩在市侩主义的躯壳里。
    然而，马文元何尝不希望自己振奋起来，何尝满意“自己那老一套呀！”当他从“党委机关跨进了报社的大门”，马文元也曾梦想过在新环境里改变一下自己。可是，这个梦想又被粉碎了。雷厉风行的陈立栋，为了给他的总编室主任一个下马威，他“促使人怀疑的不是自己的缺点，而是自己这个人本身存在的价值的大小”，口授了马文元三篇社论的内容，“但是三篇社论都没有见报”，而且在会上进行了公开的批评。“从此马文元变得更沉默了。”他一切服从了陈立栋的意志，“学会了按总编辑陈立栋的思想来思考”。“又开始了风平浪静的日子。没有什么争论，没有什么吵闹，没有什么大事要马文元决定。”马文元的革命精神再生的希望被摧毁了。只有当“黄佳英的声音一路不断地响在马文元的前面”的“新形势”下，才迫使马文元走上了新的矛盾时期。于是，他徘徊在陈立栋和黄佳英之间，逐渐懂得了“一个人有自己的意见，是多么快乐的事”的新的“生活真理”，和黄佳英们站在一起“独立思考”，从一个共产党员过渡到个人主义的彼岸，参加了黄佳英的党，马文元这才找到了真正“再生”的归宿。
    对马文元的描写，确实很“生动”。然而，人们只要深思一下，就不由得被隐蔽在这些描写里的作者的阴险意图激怒起来。马文元的形象，马文元的生活道路，只是告诉人们一个这样的“真理”：一个人参加了共产党，不是找到了真正的崇高的理想，坚定的人生道路，为人民为国家为人类贡献自己的生命和力量，而是意志和精神的不断被摧毁，一直到使他完全失去了生气，变成了软体的蠕虫，这就是党给一个党员安排的生活道路！
    在刘宾雁的笔下，马文元的生活道路是如此，而摧毁他生活信心的陈立栋又何尝不是一个过来人啊！所谓“陈立栋的坏”，固然在于他的专横保守，可是，这位总编辑又何尝没有自己的思想，自己的意志啊！只是二十年的党龄，他自己的思想和意志，在革命过程中已经先马文元而被摧毁了。他摧毁马文元生活信心的行动，不过是“多年的媳妇熬成婆”的再版而已。
    在黄佳英和陈立栋的一次谈话以后，独断专横的陈立栋也有过多么痛苦的内心独白呀！
    不知是黄佳英眼睛里投过来的那股重重的轻蔑呢？还是声音里陈立栋不常听到的那股自信劲儿，叫陈立栋不自在老半天。他的自尊感挣扎着，挣扎着，几乎把他的意识引到这个念头上来：
    “二十年前，我也不比你差！”
      这念头使他吃了一惊，紧跟着就想起，二十五岁时，他时常与
  人争论，三十二岁时，他还保留着一些独立的观点，等他更加成熟、老练，他就更加不轻易表示和时常放弃自己的看法了。四十二岁， 他成了完全另一个人。
      “可是”，他的思路继续下去，“只要省委答应，我能把这张报纸办得人人爱看，个个夸赞！只要省委答应……”
    如果以为这段内心独白的心理描写，是在表现生理上的年龄的增长，“锈损了”陈立栋的“灵魂”，那自然是可笑的。在刘宾雁的笔下，陈立栋之所以变成今天的陈立栋，责任并不在他，是“革命熔炉”使他走上了这样的生活道路。同样的，报纸之所以办不好，责任也不在陈立栋的保守专横，而是在陈立栋之上，有刘宾雁所痛恨的更加保守、专横的“土皇帝”省委在。
    对于知识分子来说，我们的党确实是一个革命大熔炉，但并不是要熔掉他们的革命积极性，也不是要熔掉在集体主义光辉照耀下的个人的才能和独立的见解，相反的，是要把这种积极性、才能和独立的见解提高到共产主义者的最高水平上来，使他们在共产主义事业中发挥更大的作用，这是许多革命知识分子甚至党内不少杰出领袖共同走过的路道。当然，党的熔炉也确实要熔掉知识分子身上的一些东西，那就是由他们的出身教养所形成的资产阶级的东西——个人主义思想，无政府主义思想。一个自觉的共产主义战士，把扔掉这些包袱，看成是成为一个革命者的光荣，只有刘宾雁和黄佳英们，才把革命熔炉看成“可怕的火坑”。
    共产党是“唯物主义者”，决不回避事实，在我们一些党员中间，甚至某些部门的领导干部工作中间，是有专横武断的现象，也有革命精神衰退的人物，对于这些人，党无时无刻不在进行批评、教育、改造的斗争，党屡次进行的整风运动，就是最有力的说明。因此，党也会热烈欢迎艺术家给他们画像，借以教育广大的干部和人民。但是，这些都和刘宾雁没有什么相干。右派分子刘宾雁深恶痛绝的，并不是什么官僚主义，保守主义，也不是什么精神衰退、热情衰退，而是党。他所关心的并不是这些犯错误的同志怎样改正他们的错误和缺点，他最热心的是把这种错误和缺点加以夸大宣传，说他们是不可救药的坏人，是社会制度的必然产物。刘宾雁通过马文元、陈立栋的形象——无论是精神衰退也好，专横保守也好，所要告诉人们的，这一切罪恶的根源，并不在于个人的生活道路，个人的品质，而在于党引导他们走上革命道路的必然悲剧，党的生活的“铁箍”，在党员身上所造成的精神悲剧。总之，在刘宾雁的笔下，党是人性的摧残者，专横保守主义的策源地，党已经成了一个专横压制的保守集团，不是在引导人们前进，而是在阻碍生活前进。共产主义的旗帜已经不掌握在党的手里了。这就是秦兆阳所称赏的刘宾雁的“艺术激动”，刘宾雁通过马文元、陈立栋的艺术形象所进行的“灵魂”“挖掘”的真实内容。
    共产党既然撑持不了共产主义的旗帜，那么，在刘宾雁看来，谁是共产主义旗帜的撑持者呢？那就是黄佳英之流的反党人物。
    黄佳英、刘宾雁笔下的新生力量和英雄。确实被装扮着一幅迷人的外表，她不仅以丰美多姿而惹人注目，而且以她的积极、热情，“傲视一切不断要求革新”的行为，迷醉过不少青年，还引导了像马文元这样的人跳出精神衰退的“泥坑”，走上了“正当”的人生道路。
    然而，刘宾雁笔下的这个女英雄黄佳英的性格，究竟有着一种什么样的迷人内容呢？
    二十五岁的黄佳英，不过是一个刚有三年采访历史的记者。她却敢于傲视一切。在她的采访过程里，把党的方针和政策置之度外，在任何问题上，她都有着自己的“独立思考”，她的采访，不是为了报道客观现实发生的事件，而只是为了“安排事实，组织材料，来最有力量地说明自己的思想。”她在她的采访过程中所看到的生活，只是黑暗和缺点。她不满意陈立栋的领导，实际上是不满意省委的领导，时时刻刻想脱离省委的宣传意图，单搞一套，而特别反对报道我们工作中的成绩，甚至在贾王矿煽动和参加工人罢会，闹大民主来反对党。总之，她在一切工作中都和党闹对立。看看她这种傲视一切的态度：“……一想起陈立栋，想起她会在陈立栋面前低头认罪，她的嘴角上就现出一丝笑来，一个人在蔑视什么威胁时才这样笑的：“‘说我的意见，我的看法’”。在她的心目中，那里有什么党和领导，她在一切方面都在扩张着自己。可是，刘宾雁却把这个全身心渗透着反党气味的“英雄”，描写成一个积极要求入党的青年团员，这又是为什么呢？这就是刘宾雁写这篇作品的全部思想关键。右派分子刘宾雁是以“革新者”自居的。他曾企图把“青年团变成第二党”，用这第二党来改造我们的党，黄佳英的形象，就正是这种反动思想的化身。在黄佳英身上，刘宾雁寄托着他自己的“理想”，“本报内部消息”是带着刘宾雁所希望的光明尾巴结束的。在黄佳英和陈立栋的斗争中，黄佳英是胜利者。这突出地表现在讨论黄佳英入党问题的支部会上，在这里公开反对黄佳英入党的只是个别人，而且是孤立的，同意她入党的人却占据大多数。在赞成的人们里，不仅有曹梦飞、李鹤青、张野、马文元，而且有陈立栋，这是一幅暗示党向黄佳英“投降”的图画。这胜利的结局，分明体现着刘宾雁的狂妄的梦想——用黄佳英的思想，黄佳英的路线来改造我们的党。
    然而，不管刘宾雁怎样粉饰和美化他的“英雄”，黄佳英的一系列反党行动，都和共产主义者毫无相似之处，而是一个极端狂妄的个人主义者。刘宾雁所美化的黄佳英的独立思考和叛逆性格，是以傲视一切，唯我独尊，背叛党，背叛社会主义为她的活动中心。黄佳英所要的党，是个人主义的党，无政府主义的党。如果中国革命由黄佳英的党来领导，那只能导致社会主义的毁灭，资本主义的复辟。黄佳英的“党”，曾经在大鸣大放期间，披着革新者的外衣，试验过一次力量。但很可惜，并没有取得刘宾雁所希望的“胜利”，他们在高度觉悟的人民面前，只扮演一次“蜉蝣撼大树”的丑剧。不过，刘宾雁能够给读者留下了一个这样“生动的艺术形象”，也不为无益。毒草变肥料，黄佳英们在现实生活里的生动的续篇，也“确能教育人民懂得我们的敌人是如何工作的。鼻子塞了的开通起来，天真烂缦，世事不知的青年人或老年人迅速知道了许多世事。”（文艺报1958年第二期“编者按语”）
    三
    秦兆阳所称赏的刘宾雁的“现实主义的新路”，在这里，是十分清楚了。其本质的内容——从“灵魂”上去“挖掘”，不过是从人们的灵魂深处去丑化党，美化个人主义，以达到他们共同煽动反党的目的。这个“现实主义新路”的内容，不过是秦兆阳在他的“从特写的真实性谈起”、“现实主义——广阔的道路”等文章中所一再阐述的“干预生活”“写真实”的活的注脚。在“本报内部消息”里，确实是没有秦兆阳所谓的对于社会主义“片面歌颂光明”的痕迹，而且是一点光明也没有的一团糟；刘宾雁也确实“不是以世俗的眼光，而是以深沉的眼光去看待生活”，他所描写的人物，也确实是有“独特的，甚至是极为特殊的命运”，但是，事实证明，这并不是什么“现实主义的新路”，而是反现实主义的反动的歧路。它沉落在所谓“干预生活”、“写真实”和揭露黑暗面的泥坑里，以渗透着仇视社会主义的主观精神，毫无真实性地丑化了我们的党，我们的社会生活，然而，它何尝只是“批评”和“暴露”，它也在歌颂，而且是尽全力地在歌颂，不过，它所歌颂的，仅仅是黄佳英的反党而已。这就是“现实主义——广阔的道路”的样品。隐蔽在“干预生活”“写真实”背后的立场究竟是什么，在这里是暴露无遗了。可是，以这篇样品作为灵魂的旗帜，在秦兆阳主编人民文学的一段期间，为了修建这条“现实主义的新路”或者是“现实主义——广阔的道路”，曾经付出了多少艰辛的劳动啊！“爬在旗杆上的人”、“马端的堕落”、“被围困的农庄主席”、“改选”，以及一系列的短论、杂文，就都是为了修建这条“新路”而配备起来的武装。因此，在这股思潮的逆流里，不仅暴露了这些作者的反党反社会主义的立场，也撕破了“理论家”秦兆阳的虚伪的嘴脸，原来掩盖在怀疑社会主义现实主义定义不确切外衣下面的，只是为刘宾雁们开拓这样一条“现实主义的新路”。只要把它们联系在一起进行考查，我们就不难发现，文学思想上的这股修正主义逆流和大鸣大放期间的右派寒流，是有着一种怎样的血肉相联的关系啊！
