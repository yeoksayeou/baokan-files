Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 16th: According to TASS, Paris, March 15th, the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement regarding the March 13th demonstration against parliament by fascists and police. The statement calls on all left-wing forces and democratic forces to unite and act in concert to retaliate against saboteurs. The statement also demands the resignation of Minister of the Interior, Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury, the purification of the army and police, and the dissolution of all fascist groups and organizations.

The statement said that the actions of destructive forces in France have caused deep unease and great anger among all republicans and anti-fascists. The Political Bureau believes that this demonstration is closely related to the government's infringement on freedom of the press, the anti-democratic revision of the constitution, and the activities aimed at establishing a dictatorship in France. The statement said: The most urgent matter at present is for all left-wing forces and democratic forces to take joint action to defend the republican order and the rule of law, so that France can have a stable and strong government that can protect state organs and pursue a policy of peace and social progress.

The Political Bureau requests all Communist Party members to contact various left-wing parties, trade unions, and other groups locally to take joint action to defend the republic.

The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Maurice Thorez, has written to many parties, suggesting a grand mass rally in Paris to protest against fascism.

The Permanent Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor has also issued a letter to all trade union federations, all trade union workers, and all working people under the General Confederation of Labor, calling on them to organize and unite to fight back against fascists and defend freedom and the republic.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 15th: On the afternoon of March 13th, thousands of Parisian police held a demonstration in front of the Palais Bourbon for more than two hours. These police initially chanted slogans demanding higher wages. But soon, the demonstration became noisy and turned into a purely fascist demonstration. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "We want Dides to be in power!" and "Eliminate the Jews!" They also insulted members of the National Assembly.

This fascist behavior immediately aroused strong reactions in the public meeting of the National Assembly. Left-wing members immediately demanded that Minister of the Interior Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury come to the stage to explain. Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury explained that this was an unacceptable demonstration. The government will follow the wishes of the parliament and discuss this incident immediately after investigation.

Just as left-wing members unanimously expressed indignation, the chairman of the meeting allowed right-wing member Dides to speak. As a result, the meeting became extremely noisy. This was essentially a provocative act. Communist members shouted: "No, he is not allowed to speak, he is one of the organizers of this disruption!" Communist members, Socialist members, and Radical Socialist members then shouted: "Fascism is not allowed to run rampant!"

Under pressure from left-wing members, Prime Minister Félix Gaillard said when leaving the Palais Bourbon that the government would make several decisions on this issue and would deliver a speech to parliament.

    法共号召民主力量团结一致
    反击法西斯分子  捍卫自由
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社巴黎15日讯：法国共产党政治局就3月13日法西斯分子和警察举行反对议会的示威一事发表声明，号召所有左翼力量和民主势力团结起来一致行动，对破坏分子进行还击。声明还要求内政部长布歇—莫努里辞职，纯洁军队和警察，并解散一切法西斯性质的团体和组织。
    声明说，法国破坏势力的行动已经引起了一切共和国人士和反法西斯人士的深刻不安和巨大愤怒。政治局认为，这一次示威游行，同政府侵犯出版自由、对宪法进行反民主的修改、以及要在法国搞独裁统治的活动有着密切联系。声明说：当前最迫切的事情是一切左翼力量和民主势力采取共同行动来保卫共和国秩序和法制，使法国能有一个稳定有力的政府，这个政府要能够保护国家机关，并奉行和平与社会进步的政策。
    政治局要求全体共产党员在地方上同各左翼政党、工会及其他团体取得联系，以采取共同行动，保卫共和国。
    法国共产党中央委员会总书记多列士已经写信给许多党派，建议在巴黎举行抗议法西斯主义的盛大群众集会。
    法国总工会常设委员会也发表了告总工会所属一切工会联合会、一切工会工作者和全体劳动人民书，号召他们组织起来一致反击法西斯分子，捍卫自由和共和国。
    新华社巴黎15日电　3月13日下午，数千名巴黎警察在波旁宫门前举行了两个多小时的示威。这些警察最初高呼要求提高工资的口号。但是不久，示威队伍中间就喧闹起来，转成了纯粹法西斯性质的示威。示威者高呼“要迪德当政！”“消灭犹太人！”等口号，此外还对国民议会的议员们加以辱骂。
    这种法西斯行为立刻在国民议会公开会议上引起了强烈的反应。左翼议员立刻要求内政部长布歇—莫努里上台解释。布歇—莫努里解释说：这是一种不能容许的示威行动。政府将遵从议会的意愿，在经过调查后立刻讨论这个事件。
    正当左派议员一致表示愤慨的时候，会议主席却让右派议员迪德发言。于是，会场上喧闹到了极点。这实质上是挑衅的行为。共产党议员们叫道：“不，不许他发言，他是这次捣乱行动的组织者之一！”共产党议员、社会党议员和激进社会党议员随即高呼：“不许法西斯主义猖獗！”
    在左翼议员们的压力下，总理盖伊阿在离开波旁宫时说：政府将就这个问题作出若干决定，并且将对议会发表演说。
