    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 6th. From April 1st this year, Czechoslovakia will begin implementing new organizational and management measures in the national industrial and construction sectors. According to the resolution passed by the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's February Plenary Session, after reorganizing the management of industry and construction, Czechoslovakia will establish 344 production economic units, which will include both united enterprises and associated organizations, all directly managed by the ministries. Of the newly established economic units, there will be 276 united enterprises and 68 associated organizations. United enterprises are production economic enterprises in a certain production sector or a certain production part of that sector, formed by the merger of existing enterprises. The core of such a united enterprise is a factory with a large production scale and concentrated production. This factory's production should ensure the development of advanced technology on a unified planning basis for all factories cooperating with it. Associated organizations are only formed in cases where certain production sectors are extremely dispersed, primarily in the food and construction industries.
    This reorganization of the management form of industry and construction is carried out in accordance with Lenin's principle of democratic centralism.
    After the implementation of the new measures, government ministries will only formulate long-term plans, formulate five-year plans and annual plans, formulate indicators and quotas for united enterprises, and guide the technical development work of certain departments. According to the Party's instructions, it is also necessary to formulate proposals on further expanding the powers of districts, cities, and local national committees to adapt to the implementation of the new management system.
    Široký pointed out at the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Plenary Session that the reorganization of the management form of industry and construction, the implementation of the new planning system, and other new economic measures are all proposed based on the level of social development in Czechoslovakia. In the future, all these measures can only be realized under the condition of continuously enhancing the leading role of the Communist Party.

    执行捷共中央的决议
    捷四月一日开始改组工业管理
    将建立三百四十四个生产经济单位
    据新华社布拉格电　从今年4月1日起，捷克斯洛伐克将开始在全国工业和建筑业中实行新的组织和管理措施。根据捷共中央二月全会所通过的决议，在对工业和建筑业的管理进行改组以后，捷克斯洛伐克将建立三百四十四个生产经济单位，它们将包括联合企业和联营机构两种组织形式，而且都由部直接管理。新建立的经济单位中，将有二百七十六个联合企业和六十八个联营机构。联合企业是一定的生产部门或这一部门的某一生产部分的生产经济企业，它们由现有的企业合并而成。这种联合企业的核心是生产规模大而且生产集中的工厂，这个工厂的生产要能保证与其合作的所有工厂在统一的计划的基础上发展先进技术。联营机构只在一定的生产部门极其分散的情况下组成，而且首先是在食品工业和建筑工业部门成立。
    这次对工业和建筑业管理形式的改组是根据列宁的民主集中制原则进行的。
    在实行新的措施以后，政府各部将来只是拟定远景计划，制定五年计划和年度计划，拟定联合企业的指标和定额，和指导一定部门的技术发展工作。按照党的指示，还必须就进一步扩大区、城市和地方民族委员会的权限问题拟出建议，以便适应新管理制度的实行。
    西罗基曾经在捷共中央全会上指出，改组工业和建筑业的管理形式，实行新的计划工作制度和其他新经济措施，这些都是根据捷克斯洛伐克的社会发展水平提出来的。今后，所有这些措施只有在不断提高共产党的领导作用的情况下才能实现。
