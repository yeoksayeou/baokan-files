An Inspiring Story from the Rectification Campaign

The "Mute" Speaks

During this upsurge of airing views, a humorous story spread from the First Workshop of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory: "A fake mute has truly opened his mouth!"

This is the story of worker Liu Yanqing.

In the early days after liberation, Liu Yanqing was unemployed at home, longing for a job day and night. He often went to the "blind fortune teller" to have his fortune told and ask when he would get a job. Once, the blind man told him that he would have a job before the winter solstice. Sure enough, on November 7th of that year, he received an employment notice from the Municipal Labor Bureau. He was so happy that he didn't even eat before going to consult the "blind fortune teller": "What should I pay attention to after starting work?" The blind man told him: "You are an honest person, it is best to speak less after entering the factory." From then on, he regarded this sentence as his motto. From the time he entered the factory until this year's Spring Festival, he rarely attended meetings and never inquired about anything in the factory. This anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign of airing views was in full swing in the factory. At first, he remained silent, but under the vigorous revolutionary spirit of all the factory workers and the enlightenment of the leaders, he began to realize that it was unreasonable for him to listen to the blind man all the time. In the past, sometimes he wanted to speak up about something in production, but the words would shrink back when they reached his lips. What great pain this was! Sometimes the design department drew the wrong drawings, wasting the state's property in vain, but he didn't speak up; the oil leak on his lathe was reported to the repairman dozens of times, but they still didn't come for two or three months, affecting product quality. When he crawled under the lathe, the oil would drip all over him. He thought: even if it leaked two ounces a day, wouldn't that be terrible in a month? In this way, he began to awaken. The light of the Party's education of workers over the years also blossomed in him. He said: "I have simply become a slave to the blind man's words, what kind of member of the working class am I!" So, like a volcanic eruption, he wrote more than sixty big-character posters in one night, putting forward many new and past opinions: he became the one who wrote the most big-character posters in the workshop.

### “哑巴”说话了

    “哑巴”说话了
    在这次鸣放高潮中，上海机床厂第一车间传出了一件趣闻：“假哑巴，真开口了！”
    这是工人刘燕青的故事。
    解放初期，刘燕青失业在家，日盼夜想有个工作做，经常到“瞎子先生”那里去算命问何时有工作。有一次，瞎子告诉他不过冬至就有工作。果然，这一年的11月7日，他接到了市劳动局的就业通知。他高兴得连饭都不吃就去请教这位“瞎子先生”：“参加工作以后要注意些什么？”瞎子就对他说：“你是一个老实人，进厂后少说话为妙。”从此，他就把这句话奉为箴言，自进厂一直到今年春节为止，很少开会，从不过问厂里的一切事情。这次反浪费反保守的大鸣大放在厂里搞得热火朝天，起初他仍是默默无声，可是在全厂职工旺盛的革命干劲和领导的启发之下，开始意识到自己一直在听瞎子的话实在没有道理。过去有的时候为了生产上的一件事情想讲话，可是话到嘴边又缩了回去，这是多么大的痛苦！有时设计科画错了图样，白白浪费了国家的财产，而自己却不开口；自己车床上的漏油问题，请了修理工几十次，两三个月仍是不来修理，影响产品质量，当自己爬到车床下面去时，车油还滴得满身是油。他想：就算它一天漏了二两吧，一个月可不得了。就这样，他开始觉醒过来了。几年来党对工人教育的光芒，也在他的身上开花了。他说：“我简直变成瞎子一句话的奴隶了，还算什么工人阶级里的一分子！”于是，就像火山爆发一样，一个晚上他连写了六十多张大字报，把许许多多新的和过去的意见，都提了出来：他成了车间里写大字报最多的一个。
