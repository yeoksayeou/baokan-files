Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The 1958 Plant (Mine) Director Conference of the Building Materials Industry concluded on the 11th. Based on the spirit of opposing waste, opposing conservatism, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, this conference evaluated the production and capital construction targets for 1958. As a result, the cement production target was raised from the original 7.2 million tons to 8.18 million tons, an increase of 13.6% from the original target and an increase of more than 1.3 million tons compared to 1957. The glass target was raised from the original 45.2 million square meters to 50.6 million square meters, an increase of 11.9% from the original target. The targets for building ceramics, asbestos cement products, and other products have also been greatly increased.

The Plant (Mine) Director Conference discussed the issue of producing new products and adopting new technologies during the Second Five-Year Plan period and decided to produce new products such as fiberglass, glass cloth, glass wool, glass tubes, fiberglass reinforced plastic, high-pressure asbestos cement pipes, and asbestos cement insulation boards during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The national daily-use light industry will develop at an average annual growth rate of 30% during the Second Five-Year Plan period. This task was determined by the Ministry of Light Industry at the National Conference of Provincial and Municipal Industrial Bureau Directors held from the 6th to the 12th of this month. In order to complete this task, the conference demanded that the output value of light industry this year increase by 44.3% compared to last year.

The conference, based on the different conditions of various industries, put forward future development directions and formulated production targets for various products. The output of machine-made paper, glassware, thermos bottles, leather, rubber shoes, bicycles, sewing machines, calculators, and other products will more than double by 1962 compared to 1957, with bicycles exceeding two and a half times; the output of ceramic products, enamel basins, mugs, fountain pens, and other products will also increase. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, high-end products such as watches and cameras will also be produced in batches.

    高速度前进
    水泥玻璃比原指标提高10％以上
    轻工业产值将比去年增长44.3％
    据新华社13日讯　建筑材料工业1958年厂（矿）长会议11日结束。这次会议根据反浪费、反保守、比先进、赶先进的精神，对1958年生产、基本建设指标进行了评比。结果，水泥生产指标由原七百二十万吨提高到八百一十八万吨，比原指标增长13.6％，比1957年增加一百三十多万吨；玻璃由原指标四千五百二十万平方公尺提高到五千零六十万平方公尺，比原指标增长11.9％。建筑瓷器、石棉水泥制品等产品的指标都有很大的增加。
    厂（矿）长会议对第二个五年计划期间，生产新产品和采用新技术的问题进行了讨论，决定在第二个五年计划期间，生产玻璃丝、玻璃布、玻璃棉、玻璃管、玻璃钢、高压石棉水泥管、石棉水泥绝缘板等新产品。
    据新华社1 3日讯　全国日用轻工业在第二个五年计划期间将以平均每年增长30％的速度向前发展。这个任务是轻工业部在本月6日到12日召开的全国各省、市工业厅局长会议确定的。为了完成这一任务，会议要求今年轻工业产值要比去年增长44.3％。
    这次会议根据各行业的不同条件，分别提出了今后的发展方向，并且制订出各种产品的生产指标。机制纸、玻璃器皿、热水瓶、皮革、胶鞋、自行车、缝纫机、计算机等产品，到1962年，产量都将比1957年超过一倍以上，其中自行车将超过二倍半；陶瓷制品、搪瓷面盆、口杯、自来水笔等产品的产量也将有所增长。在第二个五年计划期间，还将成批生产手表、照像机等高级产品。
