Jubilant News from the Dabie Mountains

Jubilant news comes from the Dabie Mountains: Yuexi has completed the afforestation of the entire county five years ahead of schedule. The Anhui Daily published this news on the front page on February 28th. The news said that the people of the county, with revolutionary vigor, successfully completed the task in forty-five days before the Spring Festival. 1.25 million mu of suitable barren hills have been completely afforested, making it the first afforested county in the province.

One Commune Operates Seven Factories

From 1956 to January of this year, the Xiatun Commune in Xingyi County, Guizhou Province, has established seven factories. The Guizhou Daily published this news on the front page on February 23rd. These factories provide great support for agricultural production. For example, the iron factory established last year produced 16,400 pieces of farm tools of various sizes throughout the year, of which more than 9,000 pieces were directly produced for the commune itself; the lime factory produced 1.5 million jin of lime, all of which was used for fertilization and soil improvement within the commune; the rice mill supplied a total of 160,000 jin of fine bran for the cooperative's pig raising throughout the year. These three items alone saved the cooperative more than 16,000 yuan in production investment.

Setting up Small Processing Plants in Mountainous Areas

The Sichuan Daily published this news on February 24th: Commercial departments in Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, are setting up small processing plants and workshops in mountainous areas, using local materials and processing them locally, which has yielded good results. For example, a newly built pork processing plant saved transportation costs in just thirteen days, which is equivalent to the entire equipment investment.

Newly Discovered Coalfields

The Guangxi Daily published an encouraging piece of good news on February 25th. A geological exploration team discovered five new coalfields of varying sizes in Binyang, Shanglin, and Xincheng counties, Guangxi. The large coalfield near Baixu in Shanglin alone has recoverable coal reserves of over 100 million tons.

The Determination of Nanjing Scientists

Scientists from various units in the Nanjing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences warmly responded to the proposal of seventeen scientists in Shanghai. The Xinhua Daily reported this on the 1st and published their letter of determination. In addition to fully agreeing with the five goals proposed by the Shanghai scientists in their letter of determination, they also put forward three specific requirements: emphasizing physical labor, closely integrating research work with the reality of socialist construction, and cultivating young cadres who are both red and expert. The Xinhua Daily published a short commentary, hoping that their bold action would trigger a "chain reaction" among all scientists and other senior intellectuals in Jiangsu Province.

Fifteen Thousand "Dengjiabaos"

Water and soil conservation work in Gansu Province is advancing rapidly. The Gansu Daily reported on February 28th: More than 2,500 "Dengjiabaos" have already emerged in Gansu, and according to statistics reported by various regions, they plan to create another 15,047 "Dengjiabaos" this year. These advanced areas require that the vast majority achieve centralized governance, comprehensive governance, complete engineering measures, and basically control soil erosion. In Dengjiabao, Wushan County, water and soil erosion has been controlled in an area of four square kilometers, resulting in the "four rare" phenomena of "rice fields moved to the mountains, terraced fields connected, ducks swimming in dams, and bumper harvests on mountain land," thus becoming a banner for the development of mountainous areas in Gansu.

Promote This Contact System

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to promote the experience of Northwest Agricultural College and Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative and other production units in establishing a contact system. This decision was published in the Shaanxi Daily on March 1st. The decision pointed out that this approach provides a concrete form for combining teaching, research, and production, and for combining intellectuals with workers and peasants. Institutions of higher and secondary agricultural education and agricultural experiment and research institutions can all follow the example of Northwest Agricultural College and establish regular contact with nearby agricultural cooperatives. Schools of other majors can also establish contact systems with nearby relevant production units and business units in conjunction with their own majors.

    在各地报纸上
    大别山麓的捷报
    大别山麓传来捷报，岳西提前五年完成全县绿化。安徽日报2月28日头条发表了这条消息。消息说全县人民以革命干劲，在春节前四十五天时间胜利完成任务。一百二十五万亩宜林荒山，已全部绿化，成为全省第一个绿化县。
  一个社办七个厂
    贵州省兴义县下午屯社从1956年到今年1月份，先后建立了七个工厂。2月23日的贵州日报一版头条刊登了这条新闻。这些工厂给农业生产以很大支援，如去年办的铁工厂全年生产了一万六千四百件大小农具，其中直接为本社生产的就有九千多件；石灰厂生产了一百五十万斤石灰，全部用到社内施肥和土壤改良上；打米厂全年供应合作社养猪的细糠共十六万斤。仅这三项就为合作社节约了一万六千余元的生产投资。到山区办小型加工厂
    四川日报2月24日刊登了这样一条新闻，四川奉节县商业部门深入山区办小型加工厂和作坊，就地取材，就地加工，已收到很好的效果。像新建的一个猪肉加工厂，仅十三天所节约的运费，就等于全部设备投资。
    新发现的煤田
    2月25日的广西日报上刊登了一条振奋人心的好消息。某地质勘探队在广西宾阳、上林、忻城等县新发现了大、小五处煤田。仅上林白墟附近的一处大煤田，可采的煤有一亿吨以上。
  南京科学家的决心
    中国科学院南京区各单位的科学工作者，热烈响应上海十七位科学家的倡议。1日的新华日报作了报道，并发表了他们的决心书。他们在决心书中除完全同意上海科学家提出的五项目标外，还提出了重视劳动锻炼、使研究工作密切结合社会主义建设的实际、培养又红又专的青年干部等三项具体要求。新华日报发表了短评，希望他们这种豪迈的行动，能在江苏省所有科学工作者和其他高级知识分子中引起“链锁反应”。一万五千个“邓家堡”
    甘肃省水土保持工作正向前跃进。2月28日甘肃日报报道：甘肃已经出现了二千五百多个“邓家堡”，据各地自报统计，准备今年再出现一万五千零四十七个“邓家堡”。这些先进地区，要求绝大部分达到集中治理、综合治理，完成工程措施，基本上控制水土流失。武山县邓家堡由于在四个平方公里的面积上控制住水土流失，出现了“稻田搬上山，梯田连成片，鸭子坝中游，山地大丰收”的“四大稀罕”景象，从而成为甘肃开发山区的一面旗帜。
  推广这种联系制度
    中共陕西省委决定推广西北农学院和烽火农业社等生产单位建立联系制度的经验。这个决定刊载在3月1日的陕西日报上。决定中指出这种作法，为教学、研究与生产结合、知识分子与工农结合的方向，提供了具体的形式。高等、中等农业学校、农业试验研究机关，均可仿效西北农学院的作法，同邻近农业社建立经常的联系。其它专业的学校也可结合自己的专业，同邻近有关的生产单位、业务单位建立联系制度。
