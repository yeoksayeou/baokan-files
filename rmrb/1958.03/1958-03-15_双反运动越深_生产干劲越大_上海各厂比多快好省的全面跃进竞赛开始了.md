    The deeper the double-anti movement goes, the greater the production enthusiasm
    A comprehensive leap forward competition of more, faster, better and more economical has begun in Shanghai factories
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 14th. The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Shanghai factories has developed to a new stage, and a comprehensive leap forward competition of comparing advanced, comparing more, faster, better and more economical has begun.
    The great rectification and great reforms have inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the city's workers. In the past three days, several of the largest electromechanical factories have launched a battle to compete for the advanced. The Shanghai Turbine Factory took the lead in making a three-level jump in this year's planned targets: the annual commodity output value jumped from the original 37 million yuan to 53 million yuan, and the new product design increased by eight times compared with last year. The Shanghai Motor Factory, which is adjacent to it, closely followed on the 11th and proposed: the total output value target jumped from the original 68% increase over last year to 110%, and the number of new product trial production projects jumped from 42 to 58. The leap forward of the two factories has promoted the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which has always been at the forefront of the movement. At noon on the 12th, the factory's workers held a rally to make an oath, and proposed new targets with a greater leap forward than the turbine factory and the motor factory: this year's machine tool output will increase by 150% compared with last year, the new product design will increase by 1150% compared with last year, and the new product trial production will exceed the total of the past eight years. The machine tool factory ran to the front again.
    Yangshupu Power Plant, one of the largest thermal power plants in the Far East, took the advanced parts of the targets of domestic power plants as its competition objects. They proposed that this year's coal consumption should be lower than that of Fushun and Fuxin power plants, and the cost per kilowatt-hour should be lower than that of Shanghai Zhabei Power Plant. On the 11th, Zhabei Power Plant proposed new targets to compete with them. That evening, the workers of Yangshupu Plant held an emergency meeting to discuss various measures and methods to further reduce costs and strive for new victories.
    More than 50 cotton textile factories, which proposed to compete with Qingdao in terms of cotton yarn quality this year, have started more intense work. In the past few days, the engineering and technical personnel and cadres of many factories have been working day and night in the workshops with the workers to carry out various experiments to improve quality. Now, 31 factories in the city have produced high-quality yarn. On the 12th, on the key experimental machine at the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory, the production of high-quality yarn reached more than 60%. The slogan of this factory is: work hard for 20 days and strive to make the high-quality yarn in the factory's medium-count yarn reach 60%.
    The competition for being advanced is also being fiercely carried out in many small and medium-sized factories located in the alleys. The meeting place of Xin'an Motor Factory has become an arena. One night, lathe worker Wu Yinyuan was the first to take the stage to set up a challenge, proposing to compress the work hour quota by 30% and challenge all the workers in the factory. Then, 42 workers rushed to the stage to challenge, and proposed guarantees to compress more work hour quotas.

### 双反运动越深　生产干劲越大  上海各厂比多快好省的全面跃进竞赛开始了

    双反运动越深　生产干劲越大
    上海各厂比多快好省的全面跃进竞赛开始了
    新华社上海14日电　上海工厂反浪费反保守运动已发展到新阶段，一个比先进、比多快好省的全面大跃进的竞赛开始了。
    大整大改鼓起了全市职工的革命干劲。三天来，几家最大的机电工厂已经展开了比先进的争夺战。上海汽轮机厂首先把今年的计划指标来个三级跳：全年的商品产值由原来的三千七百万元直跳到五千三百万元，新产品设计比去年增加八倍。毗邻相接的上海电机厂，11日紧跟着提出：总产值指标从原来的比去年增长68％跃进到110％，新产品的试制项目由四十二种跃进到五十八种。两个厂的跃进，促进了一向在运动中走在前列的上海机床厂。12日中午，这个厂职工举行誓师大会，提出了跃进的幅度比汽轮机厂和电机厂还要大的新指标：今年机床产量比去年增长一倍半，新产品设计比去年增加十一倍半，新产品试制超过过去八年的总和。机床厂又跑到了前面。
    远东最大火力发电厂之一的杨树浦发电厂，把国内各发电厂指标中的先进部分，作为自己的竞赛对象。他们提出今年煤耗要低于抚顺、阜新发电厂，每度电的成本要低于上海闸北发电厂。11日，闸北发电厂提出了新的指标来和他们竞赛。当天晚上，杨树浦厂的职工又召开紧急会议，讨论各种进一步降低成本的措施和办法，争取获得新的胜利。
    提出今年要在棉纱质量方面和青岛比高低的五十多个棉纺织厂，开始了更紧张的工作。许多厂的工程技术人员和干部，这几天都夜以继日地在车间里和工人一起进行各种改善质量的试验，现在全市已有三十一个厂出现了优级纱。12日，在国棉一厂的重点试验机台上，生产出的优级纱达到60％以上。这个厂的口号是：苦战二十天，争取全厂中支纱中的优级纱达到60％。
    比先进的竞赛也在许多设在弄堂里的中小型工厂中激烈展开。新安电机厂的会场变成了擂台。一个夜晚，车工吴荫源第一个上台摆擂，提出压缩工时定额30 ％，向全厂职工挑战。接着，有四十二个工人争先恐后上台打擂，提出了压缩更多工时定额的保证。
