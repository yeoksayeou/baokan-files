See, Listen, Play

What activities do you all engage in on Sundays? Perhaps you are busy in the workshop or office with unfinished work; perhaps you participated in voluntary labor, greening, eliminating the "Four Pests," or sanitation activities; perhaps you are taking care of housework at home, having a heart-to-heart talk with your family, or going to the movies, watching a play, or strolling in the park... If you live in Beijing and still have some time today and don't know how to spend it, would you like to participate in the following activities? Coming out of your home to see, listen, and play will relieve you of a week's fatigue and increase your knowledge.

See the Vigor of Factory and Mine Workers

The "Beijing Municipal Factory, Mine, and Construction Enterprise Propaganda Work Leap Forward Exhibition" is being held at the Beijing Workers' Cultural Palace.

Art Exhibitions Everywhere

At Daoningzhai in Beihai Park, you will be able to see an exhibition of oil painting studies by the painter Chang Shuhong since 1928, each with its own unique style. At Qingxiaolou in Beihai Park, Yiledian in the Summer Palace, the Shuaifuyuan Art Exhibition Hall, the Nanyuan Cultural Center, and the Dongsi Cultural Center, you can also see the "Great Leap Forward Cartoon Exhibition" with the same content.
