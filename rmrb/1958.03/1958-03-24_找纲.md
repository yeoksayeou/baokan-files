    Finding the Key Link
    Yi Qin
    In the upsurge of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, the big-character posters in central state organs are plastered as if a "vast ocean." Faced with this "vast ocean," many leading cadres are both happy and worried. Happy because so many big-character posters can expose problems in all aspects, which makes it possible to improve the work; worried about how to account for each and every one of the thousands upon thousands of big-character posters. The leading cadres of the First Ministry of Machine Building once worried about this so much that they could not sleep well, and later, they thought of the problem of finding the "key link" from this "vast ocean."
    Finding the "key link" from this "vast ocean" is very necessary. Because solving the problems revealed by hundreds of thousands or millions of big-character posters one by one as in the past is not a matter of days, but of months, or even years. Therefore, we can only first find the key problems and solve them. The key problem is the "key link," and when the "key link" is lifted, the "meshes" will open, and many problems will be solved accordingly.
    Finding the "key link" from the "vast ocean" is not an easy task. However, as long as we believe in the masses and rely on the masses, we can turn difficulties into ease. The big-character posters are written by the masses themselves. What do the big-character posters advocate? What do they oppose? No one knows better than themselves, so as long as we mobilize the masses, the key link can be found. In this regard, the experience of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Chemical Industry is good. The First Ministry of Machine Building adopted two specific methods: One method is that the leaders often watch the big-character posters and have a "bottom line" in their minds about the main problems of their units. However, this "bottom line" is only the "embryo" of the "key link." Is it really the "key link"? It is necessary to take it to the masses for discussion, and then the leaders concentrate the opinions of the masses to determine a more perfect "key link." Another method is: the masses themselves summarize, classify, queue up, and pick out the best of the big-character posters they posted, and then the leaders "pick out the best" of the problems "picked out by the masses" once again, and combine the intentions of the leaders to find the "key link" recognized by the masses and the leaders. Although the specific methods are different, they are all working methods of the mass line that come from the masses and go to the masses. After they adopted such working methods, they quickly found seven "key links" from more than 900,000 big-character posters, such as "long-term plans," "capital construction," "annual plans," "technical work," "achieving both red and expert," "reforming rules and regulations," and "improving working methods." The enthusiasm of the masses quickly shifted from the climax of exposing problems to the climax of special debates.
    The methods of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Chemical Industry are worthy of reference by all units.

    找纲
    宜勤
    在反浪费、反保守高潮中，中央国家机关里的大字报张贴得好像一片“汪洋大海”。在这“汪洋大海”面前，许多领导干部一则以喜，一则以愁。喜的是这么多的大字报，可以把各方面的问题都揭露出来，这就有了改进工作的可能；愁的是成千累万的大字报，如何才能做到一一都有交代。第一机械工业部的领导干部就曾为这愁得连觉都睡不好，后来，才想到从这“汪洋大海”中找“纲”的问题。
    从这“汪洋大海”中找出“纲”来，是非常必要的。因为把成十万上百万的大字报所揭露出来的问题像过去那样一个一个地解决，这不是几天，而是几个月，甚至是几年才能做得到的事情。因此，只能先找出关键性的问题加以解决。关键性问题就是纲，“纲”举“目”张，许多问题就会随之而解决。
    从“汪洋大海”里去找“纲”，是一件不很容易的事情。但是，只要相信群众、依靠群众，就可以化难为易。大字报是群众自己写的，大字报里提倡什么？反对什么？最清楚的莫过于他们自己了，所以只要发动群众，纲就可以找出来。在这方面，第一机械工业部和化学工业部经验是好的。第一机械工业部采取两种具体办法，一种办法是领导上经常观看大字报，对本单位的主要问题，心中有“底”，但是，这个“底”，只是“纲”的“胚胎”，究竟是不是“纲”？还要拿到群众中去讨论，然后，领导上再集中群众意见，确定比较完美的“纲”。另一种办法是：由群众自己将自己张贴的大字报归纳、分类、排队、拔尖，然后，领导上将群众“拔尖”出来的问题再来一次“拔尖”，并结合领导意图找出群众和领导所公认的“纲”。具体做法虽然不同，但是都是从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线的工作方法。他们采取这样的工作方法以后，很快地就从九十多万张大字报中，找到了“长远计划”、“基本建设”、“年度计划”、“技术工作”、“实现又红又专”、“改革规章制度”、“改进工作方法”等七条“纲”。群众热情很快便从揭发问题的高潮转向专题辩论的高潮。
    第一机械工业部和化学工业部的方法，是值得各单位参考的。
