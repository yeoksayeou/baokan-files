Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th—Premier Kim Il-sung and leaders of the Korean Workers' Party, the Supreme People's Assembly, and the Cabinet held a grand farewell meeting this afternoon at the headquarters of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea, warmly bidding farewell to the first group of officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army returning to their country.

More than 500 people, including Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, commander of the first group of withdrawing Volunteer Army troops, and representatives of officers and soldiers from various units, attended the farewell meeting.

Qiao Xiaoguang, China's ambassador to Korea, as well as General Yang Yong, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Wang Ping, political commissar, and Lieutenant General Liang Biye, deputy political commissar, also attended the meeting.

The farewell meeting began with the solemn national anthems of Korea and China. Premier Kim Il-sung delivered a cordial farewell speech to the officers and soldiers of the first group of withdrawing Volunteer Army troops. He first, in the name of all the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Republic's government, thanked the Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops for their contributions to the Korean people's struggle for freedom and independence and the maintenance of peace in the Far East. He said, "You have completed your noble mission and are about to return to your homeland with love, respect, and honor. When we bid farewell to you, the hearts of our people are filled with reluctance."

Premier Kim Il-sung said, "The People's Republic of China has consistently made sincere efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and maintain lasting peace in the Far East. Your departure from Korea is another manifestation of these efforts and an important measure to further promote the peaceful reunification of Korea."

Premier Kim Il-sung said, "The occupation of South Korea by the US imperialists is a heinous enemy obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea and undermining peace in the East; it is the root cause of all the suffering and misfortune of the Korean people. The entire Korean people resolutely demand that the US invading troops withdraw from Korea. Without the US imperialists getting out of Korea, the peaceful reunification of Korea cannot be realized, nor can lasting peace in the Far East be expected. The US imperialists cannot justify their acts of aggression with any excuse."

Premier Kim Il-sung concluded by saying, "The friendly and cooperative relationship between the Korean and Chinese people has a long history. In the struggle against US imperialist aggression, the unity of our two peoples has been unprecedentedly strengthened. The Korean people will strive to further strengthen friendship and solidarity with the fraternal Chinese people in the future, and will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people in the struggle to safeguard peace and socialism."

After Premier Kim Il-sung's speech, a flag and medal presentation ceremony was held. Premier Kim Il-sung, on behalf of the Korean Workers' Party, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and the Cabinet, and General Kim Kwang-hyup, on behalf of the Korean People's Army, presented a huge banner to the first group of withdrawing Chinese People's Volunteers. Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, commander of the first group of withdrawing Chinese People's Volunteers, accepted the banner on behalf of all officers and soldiers. Then, Premier Kim Il-sung personally pinned the Fatherland Liberation War Commemorative Medal and the Korean-Chinese Friendship Commemorative Medal on Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun. At this moment, thunderous applause and cheers resounded from the stage and below.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, commander of the first group of withdrawing Volunteer Army troops, delivered a speech of thanks at the meeting. On behalf of all officers and soldiers, he expressed heartfelt thanks and high respect to the Korean Party and state leaders headed by Premier Kim Il-sung. He said that for seven years, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean people, whether in the cruel war period or in the tense days of post-war reconstruction, have always cherished us like their own children and cared for us like their own younger brothers. They have given us enormous support and valuable encouragement in terms of manpower, material resources, and spirit, which we will never forget. The revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the Korean people will always be a model for us to learn from. We will not only bring the deep friendship of the Korean people back to our homeland, but also bring back the fine style and all the advanced experiences of the Korean people, so that they can blossom and bear fruit among the Chinese people, and make the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people last forever.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun said that in order to promote the easing of tensions in the Far East and to promote the peace and reunification of Korea, we are responding to the statements of the Korean and Chinese governments and executing the orders of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and we are about to leave Korea and return to our homeland. However, in the future, we will be as concerned about our common cause as we were in Korea. The Chinese and Korean people not only have a common desire for peace, but also share common interests. If the US imperialists dare to undermine the dignity of the Armistice Agreement and launch another war, they will surely suffer even more serious defeats.

The farewell meeting ended with the solemn national anthems of the two countries.

After the meeting, accompanying Korean art troupes performed.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th—Premier Kim Il-sung and leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government arrived this afternoon at the headquarters of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea to bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army who are about to withdraw from Korea.

    金日成首相送别志愿军
    新华社平壤11日电　金日成首相和朝鲜劳动党、最高人民会议和内阁领导人，今天下午在志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队领导机关驻地举行盛大的欢送大会，热烈欢送首批离朝返国的志愿军官兵。
    志愿军首批撤出部队首长张天云中将和各部队官兵代表等五百多人，参加了欢送大会。
    我国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将、副政治委员梁必业中将也参加了大会。
    欢送大会在庄严的朝中两国国歌声中开始。金日成首相对志愿军首批撤出部队官兵作了亲切的送别讲话。他首先以全体朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的名义，感谢中国人民志愿军部队在朝鲜人民争取自由独立和维护远东和平的斗争中所作的贡献。他说，你们已经完成了自己崇高的任务，就要带着友爱、尊敬和荣誉回祖国了。当欢送你们的时候，我国人民的心情是依依不舍的。
    金日成首相说，中华人民共和国始终一贯地为和平解决朝鲜问题和维护远东的持久和平尽了诚挚的努力，你们离开朝鲜是这种努力的又一次表现，也是更加促进和平统一朝鲜的重要措施。
    金日成首相说，美帝国主义对南朝鲜的侵占是阻挠朝鲜的和平统一、破坏东方和平的万恶敌人；是朝鲜人民一切痛苦和不幸的根源。全朝鲜人民坚决要求美国侵略军队撤出朝鲜。美帝国主义不滚出朝鲜去，就不能实现朝鲜的和平统一，也不能期望远东的持久和平。美帝国主义是用任何借口都不能为他们的侵略行动作辩护的。
    金日成首相最后说，朝中两国人民的友好合作关系有着悠久的历史。在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，我们两国人民的团结得到了空前的加强。朝鲜人民今后将努力进一步加强同兄弟般的中国人民的友谊团结，并且在维护和平和社会主义的斗争中，永远和中国人民并肩前进。
    金日成首相讲话后，举行了授旗授纪念章的仪式。金日成首相代表朝鲜劳动党、最高人民会议常任委员会和内阁，金光侠大将代表朝鲜人民军，分别授予中国人民志愿军首批撤出部队巨幅锦旗。中国人民志愿军首批撤出部队首长张天云中将代表全体官兵受旗。接着，金日成首相又亲自为张天云中将佩上祖国解放战争纪念章和朝中友好纪念章。这时，台上台下响起了经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。
    志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队首长张天云中将在会上致答谢词。他代表全体官兵向前来欢送的以金日成首相为首的朝鲜党和国家领导人表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。他说，七年来，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，无论在残酷的战争时期或是紧张的战后恢复建设的日子里，总是像爱护自己的儿女一样的爱护我们，像关怀自己的子弟一样的关怀我们。在人力物力和精神上都给了我们巨大的支援与可贵的鼓舞，我们永远忘记不了。朝鲜人民的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神，永远是我们学习的榜样。我们不仅要把朝鲜人民的深厚友谊带回祖国，还将把朝鲜人民的优良作风和一切先进经验带回去，让它在中国人民中开花结果，使中朝两国人民的友谊万古长青。
    张天云中将说，为了促使远东紧张局势的缓和，为了促进朝鲜的和平与统一，我们响应朝中两国政府的声明和执行中国人民志愿军总部的命令，就要离开朝鲜返回祖国。但是，今后我们还会像在朝鲜时一样关心我们的共同事业。中朝两国人民不仅有着共同的和平愿望，而且有着休戚与共的利益。如果美帝国主义敢于破坏停战协定的尊严，再次发动战争，它必定会遭到更加严重的失败。
    欢送大会在庄严的两国国歌声中结束。
    会后，随行的朝鲜艺术团体进行了演出。
