    Lower-level cadres participating in agricultural production in the countryside should not simply work according to the orders of the team leader, but also study agricultural production techniques. This point is now generally understood by lower-level cadres. However, how exactly to study agricultural technology is not clear to everyone. Comrades from the Xuchang Special District in Henan Province, who were sent to Houhe Township, Changge County, for labor training, have found a relatively good method. In their recently formulated study plan, the following provisions are made for studying agricultural technology: each lower-level cadre should find one or two experienced farmers as teachers, using the method of "guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning," to ensure that they learn to do general farm work within half a year; each person should select a crop as the object of their in-depth study, planning to reach a technical level higher than that of local farmers within one year, so as to guide local agricultural production.
    This regulation is very good, as it stipulates the method of learning by taking farmers as teachers, clarifies the purpose of studying agricultural production, and also expresses their determination and ambition to learn. It is indeed worthy of learning by other comrades who have not yet found a way to study agricultural technology.

    大家都立这个志
    下放干部到农村参加农业生产，不仅是简单地根据队长的命令劳动，而且要钻研农业生产技术。这一点，现在一般下放干部都已明白。但是，农业技术究竟应该怎样钻法，却并不是每一个人都很清楚。河南许昌专区机关下放到长葛县后河乡劳动锻炼的同志，已经找到了比较好的办法。他们在最近制定的学习计划中，对钻研农业技术这一项，规定了：每个下放干部要找一个或两个有经验的农民为老师，用包教保学的办法，保证在半年内学会做一般的农活；每人要选一项农作物作为自己深入钻研的对象，计划在一年之内达到高于当地农民的技术水平，以便指导当地的农业生产。
    这个规定很好，既规定了找农民为师的钻研办法，又明确了钻研农业生产的目的，还表示了他们学习的决心和志气。实在值得其他对钻研农业技术尚未摸到门径的同志学习。
