    Determination, Face, and Other Things
    Wei Yiqing, Deputy Director of the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    I would like to frankly talk about some of my experiences in the ideological remolding of intellectuals at the Institute of Geophysics in the past two months.

    After the anti-Rightist struggle, everyone in our institute has greatly improved ideologically, especially the intellectuals. Many people say: Society has changed, and my thinking cannot keep up. The problem is that the change in ownership did not greatly shock the intellectuals. However, in the intellectuals, the bourgeois individualistic concept of private ownership of knowledge and a series of contradictions arising therefrom, which are incompatible with the new society, have not been thoroughly clarified and resolved. Therefore, they urgently demand transformation. The nationwide Great Leap Forward has further encouraged the enthusiasm of intellectuals for remolding. This is very valuable. However, my personal experience in the past two months is: having a strong desire for transformation is indeed valuable; if the determination is not great enough, the result will be contrary to expectations. Some of our comrades can write tens of thousands of words and talk glibly on paper. They can also spout Marxism-Leninism and talk empty theories. However, when it comes to personal shortcomings and mistakes, they cannot bear to look at it (big-character posters) and cannot listen to it. Maintaining personal dignity has become an obstacle on people's path forward. Therefore, whether or not there is a determination to eliminate personal ideological obstacles and whether or not one dares to "引火烧身" (ignite the fire on oneself) is a specific test of the combination of theory and practice for intellectuals. Is it better for the "fire" to burn bigger or smaller? Is it better to ignite the fire oneself or wait to be "整" (rectified)? Is one careful to look for problems, or does one close one's eyes and walk away with a wave of the sleeve? Does one listen patiently, or does one get angry and flare up? These all reflect the size of one's personal determination to remold. From the experience of our institute, the bigger the "fire," the better, and it is better to ignite the fire oneself. As masters of socialism, no one is reluctant to burn away the bourgeois ideology and backward and conservative ideas that hinder the development of the cause, and no one says it should not be done. It should be admitted that most comrades with errors and shortcomings do not originally want to cause losses to the country's cause, nor do they deliberately influence the younger generation with old ideas. However, in fact, personal old ideas have indeed caused losses to the country's cause. Faced with such a practical problem, we should of course treat ideological remolding with a serious attitude.

    "Face and airs are deadly things. In the old society, many people seemed unable to live without them, but today they are preventing people from facing themselves, so that people are suspended in mid-air, not touching the ground." This is the golden rule of a veteran in our institute. Indeed, although everyone admits that criticism and self-criticism are good methods of remolding, when it comes to oneself, it is difficult to put down face and airs. Comrades with great determination boldly tear off their face and dismantle their airs, and in return, they gain a new type of face and the unlimited respect of young people. However, some comrades put on a veil of shame and act like a bound-foot girl, twisting and turning, taking two steps forward and one step back. Some hover around the face pass, feeling uneasy and unable to move forward. Some comrades who help are straightforward and direct. Some skim the surface, leaving half their words unsaid. In short, tearing off face and dismantling airs is by no means easy. It is a tortuous and complex process, and it is also a process of raising awareness. Our experience is that the more thoroughly the airs are dismantled, the more thoroughly the shortcomings are dug out; and the more thoroughly the shortcomings are dug out, the faster the awareness is raised. Only when both the helped and the helpers have this common understanding can they achieve the goal of thorough remolding. It is impossible to imagine that a person who clings to personal authority and airs can give his heart to the Party organization; nor can one believe that superficial help is true comradeship.

    Often, when the problem goes to a certain depth, people develop a compromise mentality. That is, the helped person is not strict with himself, he thinks: "It's better to change it secretly, why do I have to go all the way?" The helper thinks: "It's okay to raise the problem, there's no need to make a pledge of allegiance under the city walls!" The problem is this: waiting is very appropriate, but if one imagines that "raising the issue" can "secretly change it," then it will be difficult. Of course, changing what is put into action takes a certain amount of time, but intentionally retaining a third of it makes it difficult to guarantee that the shortcomings and mistakes will not take root and sprout again, and it is difficult to say that this is a determined transformation.

    Overestimating oneself and underestimating others, being "objective" to others and subjective to oneself, is a common problem among our comrades. This may be related to the life experiences of these comrades. Especially with regard to the guiding ideology of the business, they are very confident and very subjective. One often hears the saying: "I dare not boast politically, but I am okay in business!" The business guiding ideology of many comrades is good, but it cannot be denied that the business ideas and methods of many comrades are outdated. These comrades stick to conventions and cannot adapt to the requirements of the new situation. A large part of the work losses caused by this type of thinking belong to the category of understanding. Since it is a matter of understanding, there is naturally a process of understanding. According to the experience of our institute, helpers cannot regard those who cannot think through for a while as stubbornly resisting and refusing to remold. The helped should not seal themselves off with backwardness and insist on their own opinions. The attitude of helpers can only be sincere and patient persuasion, and cannot be replaced by other means; the helped can only present facts and debate, and cannot take it all on themselves. In this way, the movement will deepen and awareness will increase.

    The ideological remolding of intellectuals is not entirely a personal matter. It is related to the development of the country's cause. Without an ideological leap, there can be no leap in work. Implementing the determination to transform into action, although it is inevitable to have temporary unhappiness, once one recognizes oneself, one will feel refreshed and extremely happy. Our scientists are promoting the leap forward of geophysical science with such a mood and a heroic pace!

    决心、面子和其他
    中国科学院地球物理研究所副所长　卫一清
    我想坦率地讲讲地球物理研究所近两月来知识分子思想改造中的点滴体会。
    经过反右派斗争，我所每个人在思想上都有很大提高，知识分子感受尤深。许多人都说：社会变了，自己思想跟不上。问题在于所有制改变了，对知识分子的震动并不太大。但是在知识分子身上，由于资产阶级个人主义的知识私有观念以及由此而产生的一系列不适应新社会的矛盾，没有得到彻底澄清和解决，因此他们迫切地要求改造。全国万马奔腾的大跃进，更鼓舞了知识分子改造的热情。这是非常可贵的。但两月来的个人体会是：有强烈的改造愿望，固已可贵；如果决心不大，结果会事与愿违。我们有一些同志可以提笔万言，纸上谈兵，也能满口马列主义，空谈道理；可是一触及个人缺点、错误，他们就看不下去（大字报），听不进去。维护个人尊严成了人们前进路上的障碍。因此有无决心排除个人思想障碍，敢不敢引火烧身，是知识分子理论结合实际的具体考验。“火”烧大点好，还是小点好？自己引火，还是等着挨“整”？细心看、找问题，还是闭目而过，拂袖而去？耐心听，还是发脾气冒火？这都反映着个人改造决心的大小。从我所经验看，“火”越大越好，自己引火更好。作为社会主义的主人，烧掉阻碍事业发展的资产阶级思想、落后保守思想，没有人舍不得，也没人说不应该。应该承认，多数有错误、缺点的同志，本心不愿使国家事业遭受损失，也不是故意以旧思想影响青年一代。但是事实上，个人旧思想确已使国家事业受到损失。面对这样一个实际问题，当然更应该以严肃态度对待思想改造。
    “面子、架子，是害死人的东西。在旧社会不少人离了它似乎活不下去，可是今天它障碍着人们正视自己，以致使人悬在半空，脚不着地。”这是我所一位过来人亲身感受的金玉之言。的确，尽管大家都承认批评、自我批评是改造的好方法，但轮到自己头上，面子、架子就难放下。决心大的同志，自己大胆地撕面子、拆架子，而换来的是新式面子和青年的无限的尊敬。但有的同志却面蒙羞纱扮成小脚姑娘，扭扭妮妮，进两步退一步。也有的在面子关前，晃来晃去，局促不前。帮助的同志，有的开门见山，单刀直入。有的蜻蜓点水，话留半句。总之，撕面子，拆架子，绝不是轻而易举的，要经历一个曲折复杂的过程，它也是提高觉悟的过程。我们的体会，架子拆得越彻底，挖掘缺点越彻底；缺点挖得越彻底，提高觉悟也越快。无论被帮助者或帮助人的人，都具有这种共同认识基础，才能达到彻底改造的目的。不能设想死抱住个人权威架子不放的人，能够把心交给党组织；也不能相信蜻蜓点水式的帮助是同志式的真正帮助。
    往往发生这样的情况：当问题深入到一定程度时，人们出现一种妥协心理，即被帮助者对自己要求不严，他想：“偷偷的改算了，何必赶净杀绝。”帮助者则想：“提出问题也可以了，不必立订城下之盟吧！”问题是这样：等一等很应该，但如设想“提到为止”就能“偷偷改掉”，那就困难了。见诸行动的改当然需要一段时间，但是有意保留三分，很难保证缺点、错误不再生根发芽，也难说这是决心改造。
    估己偏高，估人偏低，对人“客观”，对己主观，这是我所一般同志的通病。这可能和这些同志的生活经历有关。特别对有关业务的指导思想，自信很高，主观很强。常听到有这样一种说法：“政治上不敢吹，业务上还可以吧！”不少同志业务指导思想是好的，但不能否认有不少同志业务思想方法是落伍了，这些同志墨守成规，不能适应新形势的要求。由这类思想而造成了工作上的损失，有很大部分属于认识范畴。既属认识问题，自然有个认识过程。根据我所经验，帮助人的，不能因一时想不通，就看作是负隅顽抗，拒绝改造。被帮助者更不应该以落后自封，坚持己见。帮助人的态度，只能是诚恳、耐心说服，不能代之其他；被帮助的人也只能是摆事实、辩论，而不能一揽子包下来。这样，运动深入了，觉悟也就提高了。
    知识分子的思想改造，并不全是个人问题，它关系着国家事业的发展。没有思想的跃进，不可能有工作的跃进。把改造的决心贯彻于行动，虽不免有一时的不快，但一经认识自己，则心情爽朗，愉快万分。我所科学家就正以这样的心情，举起豪迈的步伐推动地球物理科学事业的跃进！
