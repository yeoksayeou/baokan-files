Editorial Notes:

    Science Goes to the Countryside
    In order to cooperate with the great leap forward in agricultural production, the scientific workers of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, on the basis of ideological leaps forward, have adopted an important measure: transferring two-thirds of their personnel to form work teams to go up the mountains and down to the countryside, combine with production practices, and carry out agricultural scientific research. This is the necessary path for scientific workers to become both red and expert.
    The many high-yield experiences created by the broad masses of farmers in agricultural production practice have already enriched the content of agricultural science. The formation of agricultural science work teams indicates that those many high-yield experiences will soon be specifically researched and summarized by agricultural science workers, becoming valuable wealth for agricultural science. At the same time, after agricultural science workers delve into production practice, they will inevitably obtain a large amount of first-hand information as the basis for new scientific research projects. This will not only effectively overcome the serious shortcomings of agricultural scientists being divorced from reality, but will also promote mutual cooperation among agricultural science workers and encourage more comprehensive research. The combination of the knowledge of scientific workers and the wisdom of the broad masses of farmers will allow China's agricultural science to bloom beautiful flowers and bear rich fruits.

    科学下乡
    为了配合农业生产大跃进，中国农业科学院的科学工作者们在思想跃进的基础上，采取了一个重要措施，抽调三分之二的人力组成工作队上山下乡，结合生产实践，开展农业科学研究工作。这是科学工作者走向红与专的必经途径。
    广大农民在农业生产实践中创造的许多丰产经验，已经丰富了农业科学的内容。农业科学工作队的组成表明，那许多丰产经验即将具体地通过农业科学工作者们的研究和总结，成为农业科学的宝贵财富。同时，农业科学工作者们深入生产实践以后，必将取得大量的第一手资料，作为新的科学研究课题的基础。这不仅能有效地克服农业科学者脱离实际的严重缺点，而且将促进农业科学工作者之间的互相协作，多进行综合性的研究。科学工作者的知识同广大农民群众的智慧相结合，将使我国农业科学开出美丽的花朵，结出丰硕的果实。
