    Quickly Green the Cities
    Our newspaper commentator

    Since the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao issued the call to green the entire country in twelve years, many cities have begun to pay attention to universal tree planting and launching mass tree planting campaigns. They are working hard to develop nurseries, plant more trees, expand green spaces, and open protective forest belts between new industrial areas and residential areas. Luoyang has planted 3.23 million trees in the past three years, and Beijing planted 1.27 million trees in 1957 alone. Anshan also planted 1.43 million trees in 1956.

    However, some cities have not paid enough attention to the work of universal greening. Many places that need greening have not been greened, especially new cities and new residential areas have fewer trees and are filled with dust. There are still conservative views on the principles and practices of urban greening. For a long time, many comrades engaged in gardening work have limited the scope of urban greening to building parks, planting roadside trees, and opening street gardens, while not paying enough attention to the overall greening of the entire city and universal tree planting. They have not made full use of the city's scattered land and everything that can be planted such as neighborhood courtyards. In terms of working methods, they are also constrained, and the main force of greening construction is limited to the employees of the gardening department. Even if a mass tree planting campaign is launched, only some organized masses such as government agencies, schools, and troops participate, and it has not yet achieved the goal of all city residents participating and every household planting trees. Therefore, the gardening department has put in a lot of effort, but the effectiveness of universal urban greening is not great.

    This conservative thinking directly leads to waste. Because the focus of urban greening is on building parks, a lot of money is needed to build pavilions, terraces, and plant exotic flowers and rare herbs. Some cities even demolish houses to open up parks and street gardens. These all violate the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results and building the country diligently and thriftily.

    In order to carry out urban greening construction more, faster, better, and more economically, we must resolutely oppose conservative views and waste. In the case of limited state investment, the focus of urban greening is not to build large parks first, but to develop nurseries and plant trees universally. This costs less money, but the results are great. In the future, when the city is universally greened and the state's funds are relatively abundant, the construction of parks can be gradually considered.

    The tree planting season is coming. We must launch a broad mass tree planting campaign, set off a high tide of urban greening, and usher in a great leap forward in urban greening. Everyone should participate and every household should plant trees. Strive to green all cities and towns across the country in a short period of time, so that cities will show a clean, hygienic, fresh, and lively new atmosphere. The National Urban Greening Conference convened by the Ministry of Urban Construction has not only proposed the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, universally planting trees, and comprehensively greening cities, but also specifically proposed the policy of combining greening with production, and advocating planting trees with economic value. To implement this policy, it is necessary to assign responsibility by area, section, and household, check, evaluate, and ensure planting, maintenance, and survival, break all outdated rules and regulations, liberate the conservative thinking of urban greening, mobilize the people of the whole city to green all places that can be greened, plant whatever can be planted, and plant grass if trees cannot be planted.

    Now Shanghai has taken a step forward in urban greening work. They have proposed a grand plan to plant six million trees this year, and the masses have voluntarily claimed 14 million trees. The high enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai citizens has greatly encouraged other cities across the country. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the broad masses, the task of universal urban greening will definitely be achieved quickly.

    把城市赶快绿化起来
    本报评论员
    党中央和毛主席提出十二年绿化全国的号召以后，许多城市开始注意普遍植树和发动群众性的植树运动。他们努力发展苗圃，添种树木，扩大绿地，开辟新工业区和住它区之间的防护林带。洛阳市在近三年里种了三百二十三万棵树，北京市1957年就种一百二十七万棵。鞍山在1956年也种植了一百四十三万棵。
    但是，有些城市对于普遍绿化这件工作还没有足够的注意。很多需要绿化的地方没有绿化，尤其是新建城市和新建住宅区树木更少，尘土飞扬。在城市绿化的方针和作法上，还存在着保守观点。许多从事园林工作的同志长期以来把城市绿化工作的范围局限于修公园、种行道树和开辟街心绿地上，而对于整个城市的全面绿化，普遍植树重视不够，没有充分利用城市的零星土地和街坊院落等一切可以种植的地方。在工作方法上，也束手束脚，绿化建设的主要力量只限于园林部门的职工，即或发动了群众性的植树运动，也只是机关、学校、部队等一些有组织的群众参加，还没有做到全市居民人人动手，家家植树。因此，园林部门费力不小，城市普遍绿化的成效却不大。
    这种保守思想直接产生了浪费。因为把城市绿化的重点放在修建公园上，就要用很多的钱来修筑亭台楼阁，栽种奇花异草。有的城市甚至为了开辟公园和街心绿地，不惜拆除房屋。这些都是同多快好省、勤俭建国的方针相违背的。
    为了多快好省地进行城市绿化建设，必须坚决反对保守观点和浪费现象。在国家投资不多的情况下，城市绿化的重点不是先修大公园，而是先发展苗圃，普遍植树。这样做，花钱少，收效却大。将来，到城市普遍绿化了，国家的资金也比较宽裕了，那时候再逐步考虑公园的建设。
    植树的季节就要到来了。我们要开展一个广泛的群众性的植树运动，掀起城市绿化的高潮，来一个城市绿化的大跃进，人人动手，家家种树。争取在短期间内把全国所有城镇都绿化起来，使城市出现一派清洁、卫生、新鲜、活泼的新气象。这次城市建设部所召开的全国城市绿化会议，除提出了在城市中放手发动群众，普遍植树，全面绿化的方针外，还特别提出了绿化要和生产相结合的方针，提倡多种有经济价值的林木。实行这个方针，必须分片、分段、分户包干，检查评比保种、保养、保活，打破一切清规戒律，解放城市绿化的保守思想，发动全市人民把一切能够绿化的地方全部绿化起来，能种什么就种什么，不能种树也可种草。
    现在上海在城市绿化工作方面，已经走前了一步，他们提出了今年植树六百万棵的宏伟计划，群众自认了一千四百万棵。上海市民们这种高涨的热情和革命干劲，大大地鼓舞了全国其他城市。我们相信，在党的领导和广大群众的努力下，城市普遍绿化的任务一定能够迅速实现。
