　　(Our dispatch from Jishan, 6th) A new type of socialist rural health and hygiene network has been established in Jishan County, Shanxi Province. This mass-based healthcare network is closely integrated with production, actively serving production and vigorously promoting the development of production.
    The rural health and hygiene network of Jishan County has been gradually established along with the development of agricultural production cooperation. Currently, every township in the county has established health stations jointly by agricultural cooperatives. Each health station has a responsible doctor, an epidemic prevention worker and a maternal and child health worker. Their task is to take responsibility for specific areas, be responsible for all medical, epidemic prevention and maternal and child health work in the township, and train health workers and midwives. Below the health stations in each township, there are health clinics set up on a village or cooperative basis. Each health clinic has three to five health workers. Above the joint health stations in the townships, there are comprehensive regional hospitals based in central market towns. Above the regional hospitals are county hospitals, county epidemic prevention stations and maternal and child health stations.
    The Jishan County health and hygiene network system has a total of one hundred and thirty-four qualified Chinese and Western medicine doctors above the intermediate level, and ninety-six medical workers who can perform ordinary diagnoses and prescriptions. On average, there is one doctor for less than seven hundred people in the county and one hospital bed for every thousand people. The county has a total of four hundred and seventy trained health workers and eight hundred and eighty-three new-method midwives. In this way, Jishan County has basically achieved the goal of having health organizations in every township, responsible doctors in every cooperative, and health workers and midwives in every team, forming a rural health and hygiene network that is adapted to production.
    Since the establishment of the rural health and hygiene network in Jishan County, health and hygiene work has had significant effects:
    1. It has overcome the past phenomenon of no one being responsible for health work. At the same time, it has overcome the capitalist thinking of emphasizing treatment over prevention and relying on patients for a living among medical and healthcare personnel, established a service concept with prevention as the main focus, and launched health campaigns, greatly changing the health outlook of the county. By the end of 1957, there were more than one hundred model health villages in the county. Common infectious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, smallpox, relapsing fever, and malaria have been eradicated throughout the county. By the end of February this year, all two hundred and twenty-nine natural villages in the county had achieved "Five Nos" (no sparrows, no rats, no lice, no fleas, no bedbugs), and were publicly commended by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee.
    2. Serving production and promoting production. The grassroots health organizations generally adopted the method of making rounds in the fields during busy farming seasons and visiting villages for medical treatment during slack seasons, as well as providing convenient services to the masses through sign-up disease reporting and door-to-door visits according to the signs. Some health stations even put forward the slogan "Rather have the doctor run ten li than have the cooperative member delay for half a day," so that the sick masses can save labor, save money, have simple convenience and not delay production. At the same time, the health stations have assigned specific areas to train housewives and keepers, done a good job in family diet and hygiene, ensured the prosperity of both people and livestock, and ensured punctual attendance.
    3. Through grassroots health organizations, regular publicity and education on health science knowledge is carried out to farmers, and grassroots health workers are trained. In the past year, a total of four hundred and seventy health workers, eight hundred and eighty-three midwives, one thousand two hundred and sixty-nine nursery workers, nine thousand three hundred and seventy-seven housewives, and nine hundred and forty-six keepers of agricultural cooperatives have been trained. These personnel have become active propagandists and organizers in health work, promoting the development of health work throughout the county. (Attached picture)

    卫生保健网遍布稷山县
    乡乡有保健组织、社社有医生、队队有保健员
　　本报稷山6日电　一个新型的社会主义性质的农村卫生保健网，已经在山西省稷山县建立起来了。这个群众性的保健网，紧密地和生产相结合，积极地为生产服务，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    稷山县农村卫生保健网，是随着农业生产合作化的发展而逐步建立起来的。现在，全县每个乡都由农业社联合建立了保健站。每个保健站有责任医生、防疫员和妇幼保健员等。他们的任务是分片包干，负责全乡一切医疗、防疫和妇幼保健工作，并培训保健员和接生员。各乡在保健站之下，还以村或社为单位设有保健室。每个保健室有三至五个保健员。在乡的联合保健站以上，以中心集镇为单位，设有综合性的地区医院。地区医院以上是县立医院、县防疫站和妇幼保健站等。
    稷山县卫生保健网系统中，共有经过检定合格的中级以上的中西医生一百三十四名和可以进行普通诊断和处方的医务工作者有九十六名。全县平均不到七百人就有一名医生，平均一千人有一张病床。全县共有经过培训的保健员四百七十名，新法接生员八百八十三名。在保健员中，有四百人还可以进行简单的针灸。这样，稷山县就基本上作到了乡乡有保健组织，社社有责任医生，队队有保健员、接生员，形成了一个与生产相适应的农村卫生保健网。
    稷山县在农村卫生保健网建立以来，卫生保健工作已经有了显著的效果：
    一、克服了过去卫生工作无人负责现象，同时在医务保健人员中克服了过去重医疗、轻预防，依靠病人为生的资本主义思想，树立了以预防为主的服务观点，开展了卫生运动，使全县卫生面貌大大改观。1957年底全县已有一百多个卫生模范村。全县普遍流行的伤寒、霍乱、天花、回归热、疟疾等传染病已经消灭。到今年2月底，全县二百二十九个自然村全部实现了“五无”（无雀、无鼠、无虱、无蚤、无臭虫），受到了中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会的公开表扬。
    二、服务生产、推动了生产。各基层保健组织一般地都采取了农忙时田间巡回，农闲时巡村医疗和挂签报病、按签上门便利群众的办法。有的保健站还提出了“宁让医生跑十里，不让社员误半天”的口号，使患病群众省工、省钱、简单方便、不误生产。同时，各保健站都分片包干训练了家庭主妇和饲养员，作好了家庭饮食卫生，保证了人畜两旺，按时出勤。
    三、通过基层保健组织，经常向农民进行卫生科学知识的宣传教育，培养了基层卫生工作人员，一年来，共培训了农业社保健员四百七十名，接生员八百八十三名，保育员一千二百六十九名，家庭主妇九千三百七十七人，饲养员九百四十六人，这些人员，成为卫生工作上的积极宣传者和组织者，推动了全县卫生工作的开展。（附图片）
