    It Should Be Compared This Way
    The 10,000 demobilized soldiers in Shanghai held a conference and decided to launch a revolutionary competition of comparing honors in construction. This meeting was well held, and this method of comparison was well proposed.
    There are two ways to compare honors: one is to compare the past and, more importantly, the present; the other is to only compare the past and not the present. The former should be greatly promoted, while the latter is of no value.
    Many demobilized soldiers have made great contributions to the motherland in the past, which is certainly glorious and worthy of the people's respect. However, the people respect their past achievements and expect them to make contributions now. Many demobilized soldiers have lived up to this expectation. Cui Juemin is one of them. In the past, he was a brave tank driver; now, he is a skilled planer operator. He truly deserves to be a hero on the battlefield and a model in production. He was respected in the past, and he is even more respected now.
    Glorious in the past, glorious now, and forever glorious in the future; maintaining glory, carrying forward glory, and creating greater glory. This is the people's expectation of all demobilized soldiers.

    应该这样比
    上海市一万名复员军人召开大会，决定在建设中来一次比荣誉的革命竞赛。这个会开得好，这种比法提得好。
    比荣誉有两种比法，一种是既比过去，更比现在，一种是只比过去，不比现在。前者应该大比特比，后者毫不足取。
    许多复员军人，过去为祖国立下了汗马功劳，这当然光荣，值得人民尊敬。但是人民尊敬他们过去创造的功劳，更期望他们现在能有所贡献。很多复员军人没有辜负这种期望。崔觉民就是其中的一个。比过去，他是英勇的坦克手，比现在，他是熟练的刨床工。真正当得起是战场上的英雄，生产中的模范。过去他受人尊敬，现在更受人尊敬。
    过去光荣，现在光荣，将来永远光荣；保持光荣，发扬光荣，创造更大光荣。这就是人民对所有复员军人的期望。
