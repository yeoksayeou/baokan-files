Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: The Representative Conference of Advanced Illiteracy Elimination Units from Eighteen Provinces and Cities was held in Beijing from February 27th to March 6th.

    The eighty-five representatives from the sixty-seven basically illiteracy-free units attending the meeting proposed an initiative to the whole country to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Vice Premier of the State Council and Chairman of the National Illiteracy Elimination Association Chen Yi attended the meeting and gave important instructions. He first pointed out that, judging from the typical experience of the sixty-seven advanced illiteracy elimination units participating in the meeting, illiteracy in China can be completely eliminated within five to seven years. He called for a cultural "atomic explosion." He said that our industrial and agricultural construction is developing very rapidly, and the work of eliminating illiteracy, culture, and science cannot lag behind. As industry advances, agriculture advances, and illiteracy elimination must also advance, to achieve simultaneous progress, only in this way can we meet the needs of the great leap forward situation in all aspects of the country. He believes that those who are pessimistic about illiteracy elimination work can no longer stand their ground, and optimists are very popular. He hopes that the representatives attending the meeting will support the plan to eliminate illiteracy throughout the country in five to seven years. He also said that Ning'an County in Heilongjiang Province can complete the task of eliminating illiteracy within two years, why can't other counties and districts do it? He hopes that all counties and districts will answer this question. The experience of Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, is that production and illiteracy elimination do not interfere with each other, and as long as appropriate arrangements are made, the two can promote each other. This experience is worth introducing to the whole country. Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out: Illiteracy elimination work is to "open the eyes" of 600 million people. To build a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, the first step is to be literate, and illiteracy elimination is to first solve the problem of literacy. From eliminating the blindness of literacy, eliminating the blindness of culture, to eliminating the blindness of science. In this way, China can change its poor and backward appearance. This is a long-term and arduous struggle. He asked every young illiteracy elimination worker to prepare to fight for this work for fifteen, twenty, thirty years, or even a lifetime. He called on illiteracy elimination workers to use their brains, overcome various obstacles, and carry out illiteracy elimination work with the fighting spirit of the past People's Liberation War.

    Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education and Vice Chairman of the National Illiteracy Elimination Association, hoped in his speech entitled "Actively Eliminate Illiteracy and March Towards a Great Cultural Advance" that everyone would be a promoter in illiteracy elimination work so that a nationwide literacy movement could be launched. He hopes that the country will basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people during the Second Five-Year Plan; basically eliminate illiteracy among workers and cadres within two or three years; and basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged farmers and urban residents within five years (those with difficult conditions can consider eliminating it within six, seven, or eight years).

    Xiang Nan, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Shen Zijiu, member of the Presidium of the National Women's Federation, and Li Xiaobai, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, respectively requested in their speeches that illiteracy elimination work should implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and that young people, women, and workers should eliminate illiteracy with vigorous and energetic efforts.

    This meeting was jointly convened by five units: the Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the National Women's Federation, and the National Illiteracy Elimination Association.

    陈毅副总理号召来一个文化上的“原子爆炸”
    扫识字盲文化盲科学盲
    据新华社6日讯　十八省市扫盲先进单位代表会2月27日到3月6日在北京举行。
    到会的六十七个基本上扫除青壮年文盲单位的八十五个代表向全国提出，在第二个五年计划期间内基本上扫除青壮年文盲的倡议。
    国务院副总理、全国扫除文盲协会会长陈毅到会作了重要指示。他首先指出，从这次参加会议的六十七个扫盲先进单位的典型经验来看，中国的文盲是完全可以在五年至七年之内扫除掉的。他要求来一个文化上的“原子爆炸”。他说，我们的工农业建设发展得很快，扫盲、文化、科学等方面的工作不能扯后腿。工业前进了，农业前进了，扫盲也要前进，来一个齐头并进，只有这样才能符合全国各方面的大跃进的形势。他认为，对扫盲工作抱悲观者已经站不住脚了，乐观论者很吃香。他希望参加会议的代表起来支持在五年至七年内扫除全国文盲的规划。他又说，黑龙江宁安县，能够在两年之内完成扫盲任务，为什么其他县区不能做到呢？他希望所有的县区回答这个问题。黑龙江宁安县的经验是生产、扫盲两不误，只要经过适当安排就可以做到两者互相推动，这一经验值得向全国介绍。陈毅副总理指出：扫盲工作是使六万万人民“睁开眼睛”的工作。我们要建设一个有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，一开步走，就要识字，扫盲就是要首先解决识字的问题。从扫识字的盲，扫文化的盲，到扫科学的盲。这样，中国才能改变又穷又白的面貌。这是个长期的、艰巨的斗争。他要求每个青年扫盲工作者准备为这个工作奋斗十五年、二十年、三十年，甚至是一辈子。他号召扫盲工作者开动脑筋，克服各种障碍，以过去进行人民解放战争的战斗精神来开展扫盲工作。
    教育部副部长、全国扫除文盲协会副会长董纯才在以“积极扫除文盲，向文化大进军”为题的发言中希望大家在扫盲工作上做促进派，使全民性的识字运动能够开展起来。他希望全国在第二个五年计划内基本上扫除青壮年文盲；在两三年内基本上扫除职工和干部中的文盲；五年内基本上扫除农民和市民中的青壮年文盲（条件困难的可考虑在六七年或八年内扫除）。
    共青团中央书记处书记项南，全国妇联主席团委员沈兹九，全国总工会宣传部副部长李肖白，分别在讲话中要求扫盲工作贯彻“多、快、好、省”的方针，青年、妇女和职工要以生龙活虎、朝气蓬勃的干劲扫掉文盲。
    这次会议是教育部、共青团中央、全国总工会、全国妇联和全国扫除文盲协会五单位联合召开的。
