    Chongqing Higher Education Institutions Take a Further Step in the "Double-Anti" Campaign
    Spearhead Directed at the Biggest Waste in Teaching

    (Report from this newspaper) According to the Chongqing Daily, in order to further promote the "Double-Anti" movement in higher education institutions, the Chongqing Municipal Committee convened a field meeting at Chongqing University on the 19th, attended by responsible party cadres from nine universities and two scientific research institutes in the city. Attendees visited the anti-waste and anti-conservatism exhibition held at Chongqing University. The exhibition used physical objects, charts, models, cartoons, etc., to expose the accumulated waste caused by "five airs" and bourgeois teaching viewpoints at the university. The meeting also focused on introducing the leap forward plans formulated by some units of the university after criticizing waste and conservatism.

    Ren Baige, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in higher education institutions has been launched vigorously and has begun to show a new atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward. However, the current movement has two "insufficiencies": one is not deep enough, and the other is not thorough enough in rectification. He instructed everyone not to be satisfied with exposing material waste and conservatism, but to go a step further and oppose waste and conservatism in teaching. In schools, the biggest waste is cultivating talents who do not meet the standards, who are not both red and expert. Examining from this point, we can find problems in teaching principles, methods, and leadership, and the leap forward should also be from this aspect.

    重庆高等学校双反跨进一步
    矛头指向教学中的最大浪费
    本报讯　据重庆日报消息：为进一步推动高等学校的双反运动，重庆市委于19日召集全市九个高等学校和两个科学研究所的党员负责干部在重庆大学举行现场会议。到会人员参观了重庆大学举办的反浪费、反保守展览会。展览会用实物、图表、模型、漫画等揭露了这个学校由于“五气”和资产阶级教学观点所造成的积压浪费。会上也重点介绍了这个学校有些单位在批判了浪费、保守以后所制订的跃进规划。
    市委书记任白戈在会上作了讲话。他说，高等学校的反浪费、反保守运动是轰轰烈烈地开展起来了，并且开始出现了大跃进的新气象，但是目前的运动存在两个“不够”，一个是深入不够，一个是整改不够。他指示大家不要满足于揭露物质方面的浪费、保守，还要深入一步，反对教学当中的浪费、保守。在学校里，最大的浪费就是培养出的人材不合标准，不是又红又专。从这一点来检查，就可以找出教学方针、方法以及领导上的问题，跃进也应该是从这方面来跃进。
