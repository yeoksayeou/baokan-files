    South Korean Rural Famine Is Severe
    Number of Starving People Far Exceeds Three Million
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th - According to the Korean Central News Agency, as spring approaches, severe famine is rapidly developing again in rural South Korea. According to the Lee Seung-man group's own estimates, by the end of February, the number of starving people in South Korea had increased to more than three million. However, South Korean newspapers pointed out that, based only on reports from some local agencies of the Lee Seung-man group, the number of food-deprived farming households in South Korea at the end of January "far exceeded this estimate."
    According to the "Dong-A Ilbo," as of January 20, 67% of farming households in Jeongeup County, North Jeolla Province, had run out of food. The disaster situation in Naejang-myeon is particularly serious, "More than 80% of the 1,000 farming households have been without food for a long time, and many women have died from edema."

    南朝鲜农村饥荒严重
    饥民远超过三百万人
    据新华社平壤16日电　据朝鲜中央社报道，随着春季的来临，严重的饥荒现象又在南朝鲜农村迅速发展起来。据李承晚集团自己的估计，到2月底为止，南朝鲜的饥民已经增加到三百万人以上。但是，南朝鲜报纸指出，仅据李承晚集团的一些地方机构的报告，1月底南朝鲜的断粮农户的数字就“远远超过这个估计数字”。
    据“东洋日报”说，到1月20日为止，全罗北道井邑郡的农户有67％已经断粮。内藏面的灾情特别严重，“在一千家农户中有80％以上已经长期没有食物，许多妇女因为患水肿病死掉。”
