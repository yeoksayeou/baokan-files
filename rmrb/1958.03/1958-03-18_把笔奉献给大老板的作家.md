    Writers Who Dedicate Their Pens to Big Bosses

    In recent years, the American bourgeois "upper class" has made considerable efforts to dilute, smear, and counteract the faithfully drawn, hypocritical, vulgar, and profit-driven ugly image of American "industrial politicians" by modern American realist writers such as Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis. The American capitalist-sponsored magazine "Fortune" once called on "writers" to vigorously create novels with big businesses and big managers as their subjects. Under these circumstances, from 1952 to 1957, some disgusting philistine literary works praising capitalists and beautifying the bourgeoisie appeared on the American literary scene. Under the vigorous promotion and recommendation of the "critics" raised by the capitalists, these works not only had a certain sales volume, but some were also made into movies.

    "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"

    The first "writer" to respond to the call of "Fortune" magazine was Cameron Hawley. He successively published "Executive Suite" and "Cash McCall," two works flattering monopoly capitalists. In the novel "Executive Suite," the capitalist described by Hawley speaks with a voice like this:

    "His voice was no longer harsh, but it did not lose that exciting tone. This voice represents power and authority, honesty and unwavering strength, and also represents fearless fantasy..."

    However, no matter how beautifully Hawley dresses up the capitalist, and no matter how sweetly he describes his voice, he cannot help but reveal the ugly essence of the capitalist. For example, in the novel "Executive Suite," a financier talking to the general manager suddenly discovers that the general manager has died, so he picks up the phone and calls his stockbroker, instructing the stockbroker to immediately short-sell the company's stock ahead of time, so as to avoid losses due to the news of the general manager's death and the drop in stock prices.

    "The Everlasting Fire"

    Philistine literary works with deputy general managers as the subject include "The Everlasting Fire" written by Howard Swiggett, published in 1957. In this book, Swiggett vividly described his "vision." Swiggett praises the rotten, man-exploiting-man capitalist society as a society with "unlimited prospects." He saw: "Those who have already been born as human beings but are unwilling to be grocers for the rest of their lives, regardless of the hustle and bustle of the business world, pursue wisdom and beauty with unyielding determination... and build big companies. What a hot struggle, what a brilliant reward!"

    "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"

    "The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit" is a novel by Sloan Wilson. The first half of this novel exposes some of the infighting in American big businesses. The second half is devoted to the depiction of a radio company manager, praising him as a "genius in the business world," and using the manager's conversation with employees to reveal the thoughts hidden in the depths of the souls of monopoly capitalists:

    "Someone should do the work of big business! The world is built by people like me! You should put your body and soul into it, you half-hearted people are our burden."

    Philistine literary works that have a certain market in the United States are an inevitable product of the decline and demise of the capitalist world. Philistine literary "writers" who share the leftovers of monopoly capitalists will be submerged by the torrent of the times along with their masters. (Lè Shān)

### 把笔奉献给大老板的作家

    把笔奉献给大老板的作家
    最近几年以来，美国资产阶级“上流人士”作过不少的努力，企图冲淡、涂抹和抵销美国近代现实主义作家德莱塞、辛克莱·路易士等人笔下忠实地勾画的、美国“工业政治家”伪善、鄙俗、唯利是图的丑恶形象。美国资本家御用杂志“幸福”曾经出面号召“作家”大力创作以大企业、大经理为题材的小说。在这种情况下，从1952年到1957年，美国文坛上出现了一些令人作呕的、歌颂资本家、美化资产阶级的市侩文学作品。这些作品在资本家所豢养的“批评家”大力的吹捧与推荐下，不但拥有一定的销路，有的还摄成了电影。
    “总经理的房间”
    响应“幸福”杂志号召最早的“作家”是喀美隆·霍莱。他先后发表了“总经理的房间”与“凯西·麦克柯尔”两部向垄断资本家献媚的作品。在“总经理的房间”这部小说里，霍莱所描绘的资本家说话的声音是这样的：
    “他的声音不再刺耳了，但是丝毫没有失去那种令人兴奋的音色。这声音表示着力量与权威、诚实与坚强不移，也表示着勇敢无惧的幻想……”
    不过，无论霍莱把资本家打扮得多么漂亮，把他的声音形容得多么甜蜜，他还是不免情不自禁地暴露出资本家丑恶的本质。例如，在“总经理的房间”这部小说里，与总经理谈着话的金融家，突然发现总经理断了气，他就抓起电话与他的股票掮客通话，吩咐股票掮客立刻把这个公司的股票抢先卖空，免得因总经理去世的消息传出、股票跌落蒙受损失。
    “经久不熄的火焰”
    以副总经理为题材的市侩文学作品，有1957年出版的霍华德·施威格特所作“经久不熄的火焰”。在这本书里，施威格特淋漓尽致地描写了他的“远象”。施威格特把腐烂的、人剥削人的资本主义社会歌颂为一个具有“无限前途”的社会。他看见：“那些既已投胎为人而又不甘心一辈子作杂货商的人们，不顾商场的喧闹，怀着百折不回的决心，追寻智慧与美……建造起大的公司。这是多么火热的斗争，多么辉煌的奖赏！”
    “穿灰色法兰绒衣服的人”
    “穿灰色法兰绒衣服的人”是施罗安·威尔逊的小说。这部小说的前半部暴露了美国大企业中勾心斗角的一些情况。后半部致力于对一个无线电公司经理的描绘，把他歌颂为“商业界的天才”，并假借这个经理与职员的谈话，道出了隐藏在垄断资本家灵魂深处的思想：
    “应该有人来作大企业的工作！世界是由像我这样的人建造出来的！应该把身体与灵魂都投进去，你们这些不全心全意的人真是我们的累赘。”
    在美国拥有一定市场的市侩文学作品，是资本主义世界没落、消亡过程中必然的产物。分享垄断资本家残羹的市侩文学“作家”，将随着他们的主人被时代的巨浪所淹没。　（乐山）
