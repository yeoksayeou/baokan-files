    "Dai" Cotton

    "Dai" Cotton is a high-quality cotton variety currently being widely promoted in our country. Its characteristics are: high ginning outturn (34% - 41%), long fiber (lint length about 30 mm), early maturity, and strong resistance to adverse conditions. The unit yield of "Dai" Cotton is generally also higher than other cotton varieties. Because it produces more lint and has good cotton quality, planting it is also more profitable.
