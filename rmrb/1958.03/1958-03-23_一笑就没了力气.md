Why?

    A Laugh Leaves You Weak
    When a person exerts strength, all the muscles in the body work tensely. Especially the abdominal muscles, which contract tensely at this time, making the belly concave. Also, the diaphragm contracts at this time, shrinking the chest cavity, closing the vocal cords tightly, and pausing breathing. In this way, the strength is greater. But when a person laughs, they must exhale, and the vocal cords must open, which makes it impossible to hold the breath, so the person has no strength. Moreover, when you laugh, the muscles of the abdominal cavity and the diaphragm are all active, which makes you feel even weaker. (Fu)

专栏：为什么？

    一笑就没了力气
    人要使出力气来的时候，全身的肌肉都会紧张的工作起来。特别是腹部的肌肉，这时候就紧张的收缩，使肚子往里凹。还有横膈膜，这时候也收缩，使胸腔缩小、喉间声带紧闭、呼吸暂停。这样，力气就大了。但人在笑的时候必需出气，声带必需张开，这就不可能屏住气，所以人就没力气了。而且一笑起来，腹腔的肌肉和横膈膜就全活动了，因而更显得软弱无力。　（富）
