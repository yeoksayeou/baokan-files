If someone still does not understand that resolutely and thoroughly opposing conservatism is the central link to fundamentally eliminating waste, a sharp weapon for breaking down all backward phenomena, and a powerful driving force for rapidly raising one's work to an advanced level, then please read the news about the Great Leap Forward from the Shanghai Railway Bureau, Jinzhou Railway Bureau, and Beijing Railway Bureau. This can enlighten their minds and lead them into an infinitely broad realm.

Under the active leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shanghai Railway Administration has launched a large-scale anti-conservatism campaign since January. All 18,000 employees have been thrown into battle, posting 100,000 big-character posters on the 25th alone. Things that were thought would take weeks or months to complete were done in days. Things that were considered absolutely impossible are now possible and have been realized. The movement changes daily, the struggle is in full swing, and the leadership is catching up, constantly breaking down conservative ideas and constantly leaping forward. The various major indicators originally set by the Bureau have suddenly changed. The travel time of passenger trains from Shanghai to Nanjing, the fastest speed, has been shortened from five hours and two minutes to three hours and fifty-nine minutes (the plan three days ago was four hours and twenty-three minutes). Starting on March 3rd, the daily mileage of locomotives increased from 412 kilometers to 480 kilometers, and the traction weight of each locomotive increased from 1,700 tons to 2,200 tons. The Shanghai Railway Bureau saved a total of 30 large freight locomotives, including 6 shunting locomotives, so that each locomotive averaged one million ton-kilometers per day. Due to the leap in speed and traction weight indicators, it is equivalent to tapping 30% of the transportation potential. That is to say, if the state increases transportation tasks, the Shanghai Railway Bureau can undertake them without increasing equipment. The examples of the Jinzhou Railway Administration and the Beijing Railway Administration also prove how great the potential for a leap forward is. As long as we boost our energy and oppose conservatism, we can do many more things.

The examples of the Shanghai, Jinzhou, and Beijing Railway Bureaus powerfully illustrate that conservative thinking and various old rules severely hinder the development of productive forces. The slogan of one million ton-kilometers per day on average for each locomotive was once considered to be achieved in five years, but now it has been completed in two months. This certainly shows how great people's creativity is under the socialist system, but it also shows how conservative the original ideas were. The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that people easily discover the harm of general extravagance and waste, but it is not easy to discover the harm of conservatism. If it were not for this anti-conservatism struggle, wouldn't the massive transportation potential of the Shanghai, Jinzhou, and Beijing Railway Bureaus still be wasted? General extravagance and waste is a damage to the socialist cause and must be opposed. Hidden conservative thinking does greater damage to the socialist cause and should be opposed even more.

Now the facts have fully demonstrated that, under the fierce fire of the mass struggle, after the leadership has truly established a resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of anti-conservatism, it can break through all backward and conservative old rules in a very short time, greatly improve productivity, and create new advanced indicators and records. And often after repeated trials, production indicators and savings indicators can reach a truly advanced level. The passenger express train from Shanghai to Nanjing was first shortened from five hours and two minutes to four hours and twenty-three minutes, which was already a stunning record, but it was not the limit. Didn't the test run on the 26th of this month reach three hours and fifty-three minutes? The first increase in production and savings by the Shanghai Railway Bureau was 22 million yuan, and didn't it leap to 40 million yuan on the 25th of this month? The "Hundred People's Initiative" of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau was once advanced, but hasn't it been overtaken by new indicators? All "good enough" ideas have been shattered by the facts. The potential that people's creativity can tap is endless, whether you believe it or not, this is an iron truth.

The examples of the Shanghai, Jinzhou, and Beijing Railway Bureaus also prove that boldly breaking through old rules and the strict requirements of technical science are not contradictory. The leaps in various indicators of the Shanghai, Jinzhou, and Beijing Railway Bureaus are all built on a scientific basis after careful calculation and experimentation. This shows that the backwardness of past indicators was not limited by technical requirements, but by the conservative thinking in people's minds. The era of always following in the footsteps of others in technology should end. We must treat technical work creatively. This should be the direction of effort for all engineering and technical personnel in socialist construction.

The Shanghai Railway Administration, the Jinzhou Railway Administration, and the Beijing Railway Administration have set us a model of resolute and thorough anti-conservatism. It not only exposed conservatism, but also overcame conservatism with practical actions. What these units can do, other industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises should also be able to do. If all railway bureaus across the country can tap potential like the Shanghai and other railway bureaus, then the national railway will be able to save hundreds of millions of yuan in investment for the country, greatly increase railway transportation capacity, and make railway work leap forward greatly.

We congratulate the Shanghai and Jinzhou Railway Administrations for their great victory in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism struggle following the initiative of the Beijing Railway Administration. We expect all industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises to resolutely and thoroughly oppose conservatism, catch up with the advanced, and accelerate the train of socialist construction that is accelerating in our country, making it accelerate and speed even faster!

### 反保守、大跃进的榜样

    反保守、大跃进的榜样
    如果有人至今还不了解坚决地彻底地反掉保守，是从根本上反掉浪费的中心环节，是破除一切落后现象的锐利武器，是把自己的工作迅速提高到先进水平的强大动力，那末，请读一读上海铁路局、锦州铁路局和北京铁路局的大跃进的消息，就可以使自己思路顿开，踏入一个无限宽阔的境界。
    上海铁路管理局在中共上海市委的积极领导下，从一月份以来，掀起了一场大规模的反保守的斗争，一万八千员工全部投入战斗，在二十五日这一天就贴出了十万张大字报。过去认为需要几个星期、几个月才能办好的事，在几天中就办好了。过去认为绝不可能办好的事，现在成为可能而且实现了。运动一日一变，斗争如火如荼，领导急起直追，不断地打破保守思想，不断地跃进。路局原来规定的各项主要指标突然改变了。上海到南京旅客列车的行车时间，最快速度从五小时零二分缩短到三小时五十九分
  （三天前计划是四小时二十三分）。三月三日开始，机车日行公里从四百一十二公里提高到四百八十公里，每台机车的牵引重量从一千七百吨提高到二千二百吨。上海铁路局所辖线路共节省大型货运机车三十台，内有调车机车六台，从而每台机车每天平均达到百万吨公里。由于速度和牵引重量指标飞跃的结果，等于挖掘出30％的运输潜力，也就是说如果国家再增加运输任务，上海铁路局不需要增加设备就可以担负起来。锦州铁路管理局和北京铁路管理局的例子也证明了跃进的潜力是多么大，只要鼓起了干劲、反掉了保守，我们就可以多做许多事情。
    上海、锦州和北京铁路局的事例有力地说明了：保守思想以及各种陈规，十分严重地障碍着生产力的发展。每台机车每天平均达到百万吨公里，这个口号曾经被认为要在五年内才能实现，可是现在却在两个月内就完成了。这固然说明了社会主义制度下人的创造力是多么巨大，然而也说明了原来的想法是多么保守。问题的严重性还在于人们容易发觉一般铺张浪费的危害，而不大容易发觉保守的危害。如果不经过这次反保守的斗争，上海、锦州和北京铁路局的大量运输潜力，不仍然是白白浪费了吗？一般的铺张浪费是对社会主义事业的损害，必须反掉。隐藏着的保守思想对社会主义事业有更大的损害，更加应当反掉。
    现在事实已经充分地说明了，在群众斗争的烈火下，在领导上真正树立了坚决、彻底的反保守的革命精神以后，可以在很短时间内，冲破一切落后的保守的陈规，大大地提高生产力，创造出新的先进的指标和纪录。而且往往要经过一再反复，生产指标和节约指标才能达到真正的先进水平。上海到南京的旅客特快车，第一次从五小时零二分缩短到四小时二十三分，已经是创造了惊人的纪录，然而并非极限，本月26日试车不是已经达到三小时五十三分了吗？上海铁路局第一次增产节约是二千二百万元，本月25日不就跃进到四千万元了吗？锦州铁路局的“百人倡议”曾经是先进的，现在不是又被新的指标赶过去了吗？一切“差不多”的思想都遭到了事实的粉碎。人们的创造力所能挖出的潜在力是无穷无尽的，不管你相信也罢不相信也罢，这是一条铁的真理。
    上海、锦州和北京铁路局的事例还证明了：大胆地冲破陈规和技术科学的严格要求并无矛盾。上海、锦州和北京铁路局各项指标的飞跃，都是建筑在经过仔细计算和试验的科学基础之上的。由此可见过去指标的落后并不是受了技术要求的限制，而是受了人们脑子中保守思想的限制。在技术上永远踏着别人的脚印走路的时代应当结束了，必须创造性地来对待技术工作，这应当是一切工程技术人员在社会主义建设中的努力方向。
    上海铁路管理局、锦州铁路管理局和北京铁路管理局给我们作了坚决、彻底反保守的榜样，它不仅揭发了保守，而且用实际行动克服了保守。这些单位能做到的，其他工矿交通企业也应当做到。如果全国各个铁路局都能像上海等铁路局这样挖掘潜力，那末全国铁路就将能够为国家节约数亿元投资，将可大大增加铁路运输能力，使铁路工作大大向前跃进。
    我们祝贺上海和锦州铁路管理局继北京铁路管理局的倡议之后，在反浪费反保守斗争中取得的巨大胜利，我们期望一切工矿交通企业部门，都能坚决、彻底地反掉保守，赶上先进，使我国加速前进着的社会主义建设的列车，再加速，再飞驰！
