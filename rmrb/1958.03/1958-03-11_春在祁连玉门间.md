    Spring Exists Between the Qilian and Yumen Mountains

  I hadn't returned to the Yumen Oil Mine for three years, and it has undergone tremendous changes. The oil derricks in the mountains and fields are as dense as forests, and the train reaches the gate of the mining area. Walking along Shuangma Road, I arrived at Bagua Fang. Every poplar tree has grown taller, and rows of old houses have new additions. Going to Donggang at night, the lights are even more brilliant. Sleepless people in front of thousands of windows, and ten thousand lights shine on the derricks. Leaving the checkpoint, a new atmosphere emerges. Outside the new urban area is the railway station, and the petroleum city extends to the Gobi Desert. Arriving at Ya'er Gorge, derricks cover the mountains. The sound of drilling machines shakes the mountains and fields, and everyone is busy with the Great Leap Forward. Entering the Petroleum Gully, wind and snow block the road. Oil workers wearing lead helmets calmly guard the oil wells. Passing Baiyang River, joyous songs resound. Another new oil field has been found, and the scent of petroleum permeates under the poplar trees. I hadn't returned to the mine for three years, and returning feels like coming home. Everyone at home says that the climate in the mine is getting warmer every year, and the sandstorms are not as severe as they were a few years ago. Returning to the mine is like returning home, and my hometown has changed a lot. Everyone asks me when we meet: What has changed the fastest? It's not that the climate is getting warmer every year, it's not the great development of the urban area; it's the soaring enthusiasm, and everyone has spring in their hearts. The development of oil extraction and refining is expanding greatly, and derricks fill the Qilian Mountains. Discovering a new oil field every year, spring will forever reside in Yumen Pass.
  One Day at Tieshan during the Spring Festival I climbed the Qilian Mountains, with mountains connected to mountains reaching the sky. Argali and Tibetan Gazelle led the way, into the Jingtieshan (Mirror Iron Mountain). White clouds float on Jingtieshan, looking up at the top of the mountain into the clouds. Every piece of stone is mirror iron, who can calculate how much there is! Climbing Tieshan and looking at the mountains, the silver light is dazzling. Without waiting for the exploration team to introduce, everyone argues that it is Tieshan. “Jingtieshan is the eldest brother, and we are the younger brothers and sisters. And there are many brothers and sisters. If you ask where we live, it is not far away, in the depths of the Qilian Mountains." "Living in the Qilian Mountains, we feel lonely and isolated. We wanted to meet people, and waited for tens of millions of years." "Thank you to the kind-hearted herdsmen, who led the geological exploration team here. Although young, they are knowledgeable. As soon as we met, we became good friends." "Not afraid of wind and snow, not afraid of danger, exploring up and down the mountains. We just love these people, and we happily donate our hearts." "When you go back, please tell them, hurry up and develop us. Looking at Anshan, Baotou and Daye, we have been impatient for a long time." "Although we have slept for tens of millions of years, we can't wait another day. As long as you move us out early, we guarantee that in fifteen years we can leave Britain far behind!" Walking back down Tieshan, I felt hot in my heart and my steps were particularly far. Visiting Tieshan for one day, I feel that spring is everywhere.

    春在祁连玉门间
    李季
  玉门春三年没回矿，油矿大变样。山野井架密如林，火车通到矿区大门上。沿着双马路，走到八卦房。棵棵杨树都长大，排排旧房添新房。黑夜上东岗，灯火更辉煌。千扇窗前不眠人，万盏照在井架上。出了检查站，一片新气象。新市区外火车站，石油城伸展到戈壁上。来到鸭儿峡，井架遍山岗。钻机响声震山野，人人都为跃进忙。进了石油沟，风雪把路挡。头戴铅盔的采油工，安详地守在油井旁。路过白杨河，狂欢歌声响。又找到一个新油田，白杨树下石油香。三年没回矿，回矿如回家。家里人都说矿上气候年年暖，风沙也没有前几年那样大。回矿如回家，家乡变化多。人人见面都问我：变得最快的是什么？不是气候年年暖，不是市区大发展；飞跃前进干劲足，人人心里是春天。采油炼油大发展，井架摆满祁连山。一年找一个新油田，春天永驻玉门关。
  铁山方一日春节翻登祁连山，山山相连顶着天。黄羊青羊来带路，走进镜铁山里边。镜铁山上白云飘，仰望山顶入云霄。块块石头是镜铁，谁能算出有多少！爬上铁山望群山，银光闪闪难睁眼。不等探勘队员作介绍，个个争说是铁山。“镜铁山是大哥我们是弟弟，还有成群的兄弟和姊妹。要问住处也不远，就在祁连深山里，“住在祁连山里边，又嫌寂寞又孤单。心想和人见见面，等了几千万万年。“感谢牧民心肠好，引来了地质探勘队。人虽年轻知识广，一见面我们就成了好知己。“不怕风雪不怕险，山上山下来钻探。我们就爱的这号人，一高兴把心都捐献。“回去时请你捎个话，赶快把我们来开发。瞧着鞍山、白云鄂博和大冶，心里早就急得没办法。“虽然睡了千万年，再等一天也不耐烦。只要早早把我们调出去，十五年保证能把英国甩在老后边！”下了铁山往回走，心里发热脚步迈得特别远。访问铁山方一日，总觉处处是春天。
