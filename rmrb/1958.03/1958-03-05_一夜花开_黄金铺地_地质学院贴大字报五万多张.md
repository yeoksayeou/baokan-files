    Overnight Blossoming, Ground Covered in Gold
    Geology Institute Posts Over 50,000 Big-Character Posters
    (Reported by this newspaper) A mass upsurge of rectification against waste and conservatism has swept through the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration. From the night of the 2nd to the evening of the 4th, the entire institute has posted over 50,000 big-character posters.
    Starting from the long road leading to the school gate, all the way to the school's office buildings, laboratory buildings, classroom buildings, dormitories, and even the awning and walls in front of the dining hall, are completely covered with big-character posters. The entire campus is truly overnight blossoming, with the ground covered in gold. The sharp points of these big-character posters touch on many issues, such as comprehensively implementing "Three Diligences," improving teaching quality, and lifestyle.
    On the 4th, in just one day, Beijing Institute of Technology's faculty, students, and staff posted over 26,400 big-character posters, fiercely attacking waste and fiercely criticizing conservatism. Big-character posters covered the entire campus, from the walls to the ground. In the high tide of the double-anti movement, this institute also successfully trial-produced resorcinol chemical and three-wire dynamic strain gauge, two new products.

    一夜花开　黄金铺地
    地质学院贴大字报五万多张
    本报讯　一个群众性的反浪费、反保守的整风新高潮席卷了北京地质勘探学院。从2日夜开始到4日晚为止，全院已贴出大字报五万多张。
    从走进学校大门的一条长长的马路的地面上起始，直到学校的办公楼、实验楼、教室楼、宿舍，以及大饭厅前的席篷、墙壁上统统贴满了大字报。整个校园真是一夜花开，黄金铺地。这些大字报的锋芒触及到全面贯彻“三勤”、提高教学质量以及生活作风等许多方面的问题。
    北京工业学院4日一日间，全院师生员工就贴出了两万六千四百多张大字报，火烧浪费、猛攻保守。满校园从墙上到地上到处是一片大字报。在双反运动的高潮中，这个学院还试制成功间苯三酚化学药品和三线动力应变仪两种新产品。
