　　Pumping Water and Generating Electricity, Killing Two Birds with One Stone
　　Liaoning Promotes Automatic Water Turbine Pumps
　　(Our Newspaper News) Liu Wenyun, of the Democratic Second Cooperative of Weizi峪 Township, Xinbin County, Liaoning Province, has created an automatic water turbine pump that can both pump water uphill to irrigate fields and use the water to generate electricity.
　　This automatic water turbine pump was successfully developed by Liu Wenyun in the spring of 1956. It utilizes the force of water flowing from top to bottom to impact the buckets, driving two gears to pump water up to high slopes through a pump barrel. In 1956, the Democratic Second Cooperative used this pump to draw water uphill and irrigate 11 mu of paddy fields, resulting in a bumper harvest. Last year, despite encountering a severe drought of seventy days, the 17 mu of paddy fields irrigated by the automatic water turbine pump still yielded more than 500 jin of rice per mu. This year, the area of mountain paddy fields irrigated using this pump will be more than doubled compared to last year, and they are also preparing to use it to install a generator for electricity generation.
　　According to the assessment of technicians from the Liaoning Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau in mid-March, the capacity of this water turbine pump is equivalent to more than two horsepower. The maximum head (i.e., the height the water is lifted) can reach 1 zhang and 5 chi, and the water output per hour is approximately 21.5 tons. Wherever there is a small river or canal with a drop of more than 3 chi and a consistent flow rate, this automatic pumping equipment can be installed to irrigate land higher than the river water level; if power generation equipment is installed, it can generate electricity.
　　This automatic water turbine pump is also relatively simple to manufacture and has a low cost. The water turbine can be made from ordinary miscellaneous wood; its water absorption equipment can also adopt a wooden waterwheel-type water lifting device based on the principle of utilizing local materials. The Democratic Second Cooperative's water turbine pump only cost 120 yuan to buy a belt, and the rest was made using old waterwheels and old materials.
　　After being summarized and introduced by the Xinbin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently, this pump quickly attracted attention from all sides, and 270 units have currently been promoted throughout the county. The Liaoning Provincial Water Conservancy Department has decided to organize visits from all over the province in late March to vigorously promote it.

### 抽水发电一举两得  辽宁推广自动水轮抽水机

    抽水发电一举两得
    辽宁推广自动水轮抽水机
      本报讯　辽宁省新宾县苇子峪乡民主二社刘文云创造一种自动水轮抽水机，既能抽水上山灌田，又可车水发电。
    这种自动水轮抽水机，是刘文云在1956年春天研究成功的。它是利用水流从上而下冲击水斗的力量，带动两个齿轮通过抽水筒把水抽到高坡上去。1956年民主二社用这种抽水机，引水上山灌溉了十一亩水田，获得了大丰收；去年虽然遇到了七十天大旱，用自动水轮抽水机灌溉的十七亩水田，每亩仍然产水稻五百多斤。今年利用这种抽水机灌溉的山地水田面积将比去年增加一倍以上，并且准备利用它安装发电机发电。
    根据3月中旬辽宁省水利局技术人员的鉴定，这种水轮抽水机的能力相当于两个马力还多，最大扬程（即把水上提的高度）可达到一丈五尺高，每小时出水量大约为二十一吨半。凡是有三尺以上落差，经常保持一定流量的小河或渠道，都可以装置这种自动抽水设备，灌溉高于河流水位的土地；如果安装上发电设备，便可以发电。
    这种自动水轮抽水机，制造也比较简单，成本低廉。水轮机，用一般杂木即可制造；其吸水设备，也可根据就地取材的原则，采用木制水车式提水装置。民主二社的水轮抽水机，只花一百二十元买皮带，其余全是利用旧水车和旧材料制成的。
    这种抽水机最近经过中共新宾县委总结介绍后，很快受到各方面的注意，全县目前已推广二百七十台。辽宁省水利部门已决定在3月下旬组织全省各地参观，大力推广。
