Xinhua News Agency, March 25th. While averaging a 25% reduction in expenses and a 22% reduction in manpower, striving to increase the number of readers by more than 15.1 million compared to the original target for this year, and increasing book circulation by more than 37.28 million volumes compared to the original plan for this year—this is the Great Leap Forward plan for library work for this year formulated by representatives from 28 libraries in 19 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Beijing and Shanghai, at the National Library Work Conference.

    The representatives of the libraries of these provinces, cities, and autonomous regions passed a proposal, hoping that library workers across the country would sweep away the “five airs,” implement the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, and diligent management, and strive to achieve "serving the masses, facilitating experts, providing guidance at all levels, being both red and expert." They proposed “ten comparisons” to ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan: “compare book circulation, compare service attitude, compare book promotion, compare procurement and cataloging, compare clearing backlog, compare professional guidance, compare interlibrary cooperation, compare business innovation, compare diligence and thrift in running libraries, and compare being both red and expert,” and use this to launch a socialist competition with colleagues across the country.

    The library representatives from various regions attending the meeting also established their own unit's Great Leap Forward plans. The Beijing Library decided to extend its opening hours to 13 and a half hours a day starting in late March. The Shanghai Municipal Library and other six public libraries in Shanghai proposed to achieve year-round opening and daily service, increasing the number of readers by four to eight times compared to last year; and to cooperate with relevant departments to establish a book circulation network in urban and suburban areas. Some libraries have developed plans to facilitate experts and deliver books to their doors; some decided to establish off-site borrowing relationships with scientific workers; and some decided to launch a correspondence book lending service for individual readers, allowing readers to "sit at home and have books delivered to them."

    Libraries in various regions have decided to clear accumulated books this year. Ten libraries in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, and other places have also decided to allocate 2.03 million copies of surplus books to support grassroots and remote areas. According to calculations, these books can be used to establish twenty county libraries.

    Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Culture, spoke at the beginning of the meeting. He analyzed the achievements and shortcomings in library work, hoping that libraries in various regions would strive for a complete victory in the "double anti" movement, sweeping away the bad styles of the past of being divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, sticking to conventions, and being extravagant and wasteful, resolutely implementing diligence and thrift in running libraries, opening up libraries, and bringing about a Great Leap Forward in the library cause, making libraries more socialist.

    Xia Yan, Deputy Minister of Culture, pointed out in his concluding report that the two tasks of libraries serving the masses and serving scientific research are unified and neither should be neglected. Library work must be improved on the basis of popularization. Opening up libraries is not just a technical issue, but a directional one. He also said that with the arrival of a high tide of the broad masses and cadres learning culture and technology, more and higher demands will inevitably be placed on library work. Libraries at all levels should closely integrate with political tasks, combine with reality, and carry out work in a planned manner.

    The meeting was held in Beijing from the 21st to the 25th.

    图书馆为群众和科学研究服务
    全国图书馆工作会议通过大跃进倡议
    新华社25日讯　在平均节约经费25％、减少人力22％的情况下，争取读者数比今年原定指标增加一千五百一十多万人次，使图书流通量比今年原定计划增加三千七百二十八万多册次，这是北京、上海等十九个省、市、自治区的二十八个图书馆的代表在全国图书馆工作会议上制定的今年图书馆工作跃进规划。
    这些省、市、自治区图书馆的代表通过了一项倡议书，希望全国图书馆工作者扫尽五气，贯彻多、快、好、省和勤俭办馆的方针，努力作到“服务大众，便利专家，层层辅导，又红又专”。他们提出“比图书流通、比服务态度、比图书宣传、比采购编目、比清理积存、比业务辅导、比馆际协作、比业务革新、比勤俭办馆、比又红又专”这“十比”来保证实现跃进规划，并以此向全国的同行们展开社会主义竞赛。
    出席会议的各地图书馆代表还订出了本单位的跃进规划。北京图书馆决定从3月下旬起将开馆时间延长到每天开放十三小时半。上海市图书馆等上海六个公共图书馆提出要做到全年开放、日日服务，使读者人次比去年增加四倍到八倍；并且配合有关部门在市区和郊区建立图书流通网。有些图书馆制定了便利专家以及送书上门的规划；有的决定同科学工作者建立馆外借阅关系；有的决定开展个人读者的通信借书业务，让读者“人在家中坐，书到手中来”。
    各地图书馆都决定在今年内清理积存图书。北京、上海、南京、重庆等地十个图书馆并且决定调拨出多余的复本书两百零三万册，支援基层和边远地区。据计算，用这些图书可以建立县图书馆二十个。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在会议开始时讲了话。他分析了图书馆工作中的成绩和缺点，希望各地图书馆争取“双反”运动的全胜，要一扫过去脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际、墨守成规、铺张浪费的坏作风，坚决实行勤俭办馆、开门办馆，使图书馆事业来一个大跃进，把图书馆办得更加社会主义化。
    文化部副部长夏衍在作总结报告时指出，图书馆为群众服务和为科学研究服务这两个任务是统一的，不可偏废，图书馆工作必须在普及的基础上提高。开门办馆不只是一个技术性问题，而是方向性的问题。他还说，随着广大群众和干部学习文化和技术的高潮的到来，必将对图书馆工作提出更多更高的要求。各图书馆要紧紧地结合政治任务，结合实际，有计划地进行工作。
    这次会议是从21日到25日在北京举行的。
