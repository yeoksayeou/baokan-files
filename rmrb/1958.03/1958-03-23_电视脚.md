    "Television Leg"
    Due to excessive indulgence in television and a lack of adequate exercise, many Canadian children have contracted "television leg." "Television leg" refers to a lack of agility in the lower limbs and clumsy movements.
    According to a survey conducted on 300 children aged six to twelve in the suburbs of Toronto, more than half had underdeveloped lower limbs. 55% of the children failed the most basic tests, and 85% failed the higher-standard tests. Less than half had completely flawless posture.

    “电视脚”
    由于过度沉溺于电视，缺乏适当的运动，不少的加拿大儿童染上了“电视脚”的病症。所谓“电视脚”就是指下肢不灵敏，行动笨拙。
    根据在多伦多近郊对三百名六岁至十二岁的儿童所进行的一项调查，下肢发育不健全的占半数以上。55％的儿童通不过最起码的测验，85％的儿童通不过较高标准的测验。身体姿势完全没有缺点的连一半也不到。
