    In Newspapers Across the Country

    Not Necessarily All Waste
    The "Reader's Letters" column of the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily) on the 20th published a letter titled "Not Necessarily All Waste." This letter reflected a noteworthy situation: some units have regarded some essential things as waste and rejected them. For example, some factories have greatly reduced fire-fighting equipment and dismissed full-time fire protection cadres. The reader believes that the loopholes that cause fires in these units have not been completely plugged, and excessively weakening fire protection forces is very dangerous; if a fire occurs, it will cause even greater waste. The newspaper's editor pointed out in "Casual Notes on Letters" that it is unavoidable that some things that should not have been rejected have been rejected during rectification due to lack of experience or leadership opinions. Compared with the huge achievements of rectification, this is ultimately an individual matter. However, things depend on human effort, and some shortcomings can be avoided.

    Comparing Safe Production
    "When production is tense, accidents will increase." There used to be such a view. The experience of some factories under the Shanghai Municipal Wool and Linen Company has proven that this statement is untenable. The Jiefang Ribao (Liberation Daily) reported on the 20th that nine of the 22 factories under the Wool and Linen Company achieved zero accidents in January this year, and the number of factories with zero accidents increased to 18 in February. Recently, the Wool and Linen Company and the Municipal Textile Workers' Union jointly organized a leap forward conference on safe production. Representatives of units such as the Yuhua Woolen Mill introduced their experiences in reducing and eliminating accidents, and heated challenges and responses were launched between the factories. The factories also put forward a joint initiative to carry out a socialist competition for safe production with fraternal factories in the cotton spinning, printing and dyeing, weaving, silk, and underwear industries in the city. The Jiefang Ribao published a short commentary supporting their initiative.

    New Developments in Experimental Fields
    The experimental fields in Hong'an County, which everyone cares about, have now had new developments. The Hubei Ribao (Hubei Daily) reported on the 20th: On the basis of the original "Five Competencies" (competent in plowing, harrowing, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, selecting seeds, mixing seeds, applying fertilizer, mastering the production season, competent in transplanting seedlings, and weeding), the county has also proposed "Five Personnel" (agricultural water conservancy technicians, livestock epidemic prevention personnel, fruit tree grafting personnel, propagandists, and accountants) and "Five Abilities" (ability to produce, work, write articles, summarize experiences, and create). It also registered the experimental fields cultivated by rural cadres throughout the county, and prepared to make uniform cards to record technical operations, growth processes, etc., in order to facilitate inspection and summarization.

    "Boats" and "Bridges"
    Jiangxi Province is doing everything possible to raise funds for local industries. They believe that this is the problem of "boats" and "bridges" that urgently needs to be solved for local industries. The Jiangxi Ribao published an editorial on this issue on the 19th and organized a special column report. These reports show through many facts that relying on the masses and self-reliance is the broad road to solving the funding problems of local industries. At the industrial and transportation conference held by the Shangrao Prefectural Committee, Boyang County decided on the spot to invest 1.52 million yuan to run industries. Yugan County's Unity Agricultural Cooperative has taken out more than 42,000 yuan in public accumulation funds to develop industry. Rao埠 Agricultural Cooperative in Boyang County does not want a penny from the state and plans to run 17 small-scale industries this year.

    Grasping the Key Points in the General Inspection
    The editorial of the Hubei Ribao on the 19th discussed a vivid example that emerged during this general inspection. In Shenji District of Jingmen County, during this inspection, it was discovered that the district party committee's key cooperative, which was originally considered advanced, was inferior in everything; while the Xinhu Cooperative, which was originally considered backward for a long time, was good in everything. After the truth about good and bad was revealed, it aroused a fierce debate. The local party committee seized the opportunity to promptly propose to carry out the "Double Anti" and "Eight Comparisons" movement, and in just three and a half days, it set off a high tide of rectification throughout the district, effectively carrying out major rectification and major changes, and greatly promoted the current spring plowing production.

专栏：在各地报纸上

    在各地报纸上
    不一定都是浪费
    20日新闻日报读者来信栏中发表了一封题为“不一定都是浪费”的来信。这封来信反映了一个值得注意的情况：有些单位把一些必需的东西，也当作浪费反掉了。例如某些工厂大大削减消防设备，撤销消防专职干部。读者认为，目前这些单位引起火灾的漏洞并未完全堵塞，过分削弱消防力量是很危险的，万一发生火灾就会造成更大的浪费。报纸的编者在“看信杂谈”中指出，整改中由于没有经验或者领导上没有主张，把一些不应该反掉的东西反掉了，也属难免，这比起整改的巨大成绩来究竟是个别的。但是事在人为，有些缺点是可以想法避免的。
    比安全生产
    “生产一紧张，事故就要增加。”过去有这么一种论调。上海市毛麻公司所属的一些厂的经验，证明了这种说法是站不住脚的。20日解放日报报道，今年1月毛麻公司所属二十二个厂中有九个厂做到了无事故，2月份无事故的厂增加到十八个。最近毛麻公司和市纺织工会共同组织了一次安全生产跃进大会，会上裕华毛纺厂等单位的代表介绍了减少和消灭事故的经验，各厂之间并展开了热烈的挑应战。各厂还提出了联合倡议书，要和本市棉纺、印染、织布、丝绸、内衣等行业的兄弟厂开展安全生产的社会主义竞赛。解放日报发表短评，支持了他们的倡议。
    试验田的新发展
    人人关心的红安县的试验田，目前又有了新的发展。20日湖北日报报道：这个县在原来提出的“五会”（会犁田、会耙、会防治病虫害，会选种、拌种、施肥，掌握生产季节，会栽秧、薅草）的基础上，又提出了“五员”（农业水利技术员、牲畜防疫员、果木嫁接员、宣传员、会计员）和“五能”（能生产、工作、写文章、总结经验、创造）。并对全县农村干部种的试验田进行了登记，准备统一做卡片，记录技术操作、生长过程等，以便于检查和总结。
    “船”和“桥”
    江西省正在千方百计地筹集地方工业的资金。他们认为：这是当前地方工业急需解决的“船”和“桥”的问题。19日江西日报就这个问题发表社论，并组织了专栏报道。这些报道通过许多事实表明：依靠群众、自力更生，是解决地方工业资金的康庄大道。上饶地委召开的工业交通会议上，波阳县当场就决定以一百五十二万元兴办工业。余干县团结农业社为发展工业，已拿出四万二千余元公积金。波阳县饶埠农业社不要国家一分钱，今年准备兴办十七项小型工业。
    大检查中抓住了纲
    19日湖北日报的社论中，论述了这次大检查中出现的一个生动事例。荆门县的沈集区，在这次检查中，发现原来被认为先进的区委重点社，样样都差；原来被认为长期落后的新湖社却样样都好。好坏真相大白后惹起了一场激烈的辩论。当地党委乘热打铁，及时提出开展“双反”和“八比”运动，只三天半的时间就掀起了全区的整风高潮，有效地进行了大整大改，大大促进了当前的春耕生产。
