Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 26th: Shanghai's industrial sector is currently experiencing a "blooming" situation in the trial production of new products, with each one being faster and better than the last. The quality of many new products has already caught up with that of capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan.

The competition to reach the world's most advanced level is being fiercely waged in the printing industry these days. The finer the screen ruling on the offset plate, the clearer the printed picture. The renowned West German "Egen" factory had a screen ruling density of up to 300 lines (90,000 dots per square inch). In the past, China generally only had 100 to 200 lines. On March 18th and 19th, the Sanyi Printing Factory and the Xin Xin Printing Factory simultaneously printed the first batch of exquisite pictures with 300-line offset plates, catching up with the West German Egen factory. Immediately afterwards, the Shanghai Tobacco Industry Printing Factory reached a higher level of 350 lines on the 24th, and the Shanghai No. 1 Printing Factory produced a set of offset plates with a density of 400 lines on the morning of the 25th.

The Shanghai Bicycle Factory, aiming to catch up with the British "Raleigh" brand bicycle, trial-produced its first high-grade bicycle on the 24th. After test rides, it proved that this bicycle has caught up with "Raleigh" in many aspects such as flexibility and speed. It concentrates the advantages of Chinese and foreign bicycles.

In addition, several newly trial-produced daily necessities have also caught up with capitalist countries in terms of quality. The two types of "No. 101" drawing pencils produced by the China Pencil Factory No. 1 have caught up with the American "Venus" pencils. The "August 1st" high-grade gold pen successfully trial-produced by the Guan Le Ming Gold Pen Factory has surpassed the quality of the Japanese "Pilot" gold pen. The "Fan Brand" high-grade laundry soap made by the Wuzhou Soap Factory has caught up with the quality of the British "Sunlight" soap.

    上海新产品百花齐放
    据新华社上海26日电　上海工业部门在试制新产品方面目前出现了一个比一个快、一个比一个好的“百花齐放”局面；很多新产品的质量已经赶上了英国、美国、日本等资本主义国家。
    争夺世界最先进水平的竞赛，这几天在印刷工业中进行得十分激烈。在胶版上做出的网线越细密，印出的画片就越清晰。素享盛名的西德爱根厂的网线密度，曾高达三百线（每平方时有九万个点子），我国过去一般只有一百到二百线。3月18日、19日两天，三一印刷厂和新新印刷厂同时用三百线的胶版印出了第一批精美的画片，赶上了西德爱根厂。紧接着，上海烟草工业印刷厂在24日达到三百五十线的更高水平，上海市印刷一厂在25日上午，制出一套密度达到四百线的胶版。
    以英国“兰苓”牌自行车作为追赶对象的上海自行车厂，在24日试制出第一辆高级自行车。经过试车证明，这辆车子在灵活性、车速等许多方面，都赶上了“兰苓”的水平。它集中了我国和各国自行车的优点。
    此外，还有多种新近试制成功的日用品，也在质量上赶上了资本主义国家。中国铅笔一厂出产的两种“一○一号”绘图铅笔，已赶上美国“维纳斯”铅笔。关勒铭金笔厂试制成功的“八一号”高级金笔，质量已胜过日本的“派洛脱”金笔。五洲皂厂制成的“扇牌”高级洗衣皂，质量已赶上英国的“日光”皂。
