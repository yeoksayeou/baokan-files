Introducing Some Knowledge About Fertilizers
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Associate Researcher Chen Shangjin

Editor's Note: Spring production has begun. To help the cadres sent to the countryside grasp some basic agricultural science knowledge so that they can better delve into agricultural technology, we have specially invited several scientific research workers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences to write some articles. These articles will be published successively in this column.

Increasing fertilizer is an important measure to increase the yield per unit area of crops. Now I will introduce some basic knowledge about fertilizers.

As the saying goes, "Farming without fertilizer is like aimless muddling." Why does manure have such a big effect? Because it contains various fertilizer components needed for plant growth. Simply put, general crops contain more than a dozen elements such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and iron. Some elements can be obtained from the air and water, and some need to be absorbed from the soil. If the soil's supply capacity is insufficient, artificial supplementation is needed.

Take wheat as an example. If each mu yields 100 jin of wheat, it will absorb 3 jin of nitrogen, 1.5 jin of phosphate, and 2.5 jin of potassium oxide from the soil. If the yield of wheat per mu is increased from 100 jin to 500 jin, it will absorb about five times more from the soil. However, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil is relatively small and cannot fully meet the needs of crops. Therefore, it is necessary to apply fertilizer to meet the requirements of the crops. Manure contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and it also contains a large amount of organic matter, which can improve soil properties and cultivate soil fertility. For example, pig manure contains 0.5%-0.8% nitrogen, 0.3%-0.5% phosphate, 0.2%-0.5% potassium oxide, and 20%-40% organic matter. Other livestock manure, human manure and urine, compost, green manure, etc., also contain various nutrients and are good fertilizers.

Now let's talk about the fertility of pigpen manure. In 1956, such an experiment was conducted in the Dazhongsi Agricultural Cooperative in Beijing. Each mu was applied with 4,000 jin of pigpen manure, and the corn yield that year was 362 jin. Without pigpen manure, the yield per mu was 228 jin, an increase of 134 jin. In 1957, another 94 jin of corn was harvested, a total increase of 228 jin in two years. Pigpen manure is not only very effective for corn, but also has good fertility when applied to wheat, cotton, millet, rice and other crops. Therefore, we should raise more pigs to accumulate manure.

In addition to pig manure, the manure of livestock such as cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and donkeys is also a major source of fertilizer, which should be properly managed and applied.

There are more than 500 million people in rural China, and human manure and urine are a huge source of fertilizer. An agricultural cooperative with 1,000 households, calculated on the average of 3,000 adults, can accumulate about 180 jin of manure and 1,000 jin of urine per person per year, producing more than 500,000 jin of manure and more than 3 million jin of urine per year. In total, each person excretes 1.8 jin of nitrogen, 1.4 jin of phosphate, and 0.7 jin of potassium oxide from manure each year; 5 jin of nitrogen, 1 jin of phosphate, and 1.5 jin of potassium oxide are excreted from urine. From the above figures, the fertilizer components excreted from urine far exceed the fertilizer components in manure. This is very important, please pay attention to it. Human manure and urine are good quick-acting fertilizers, and they take effect quickly when used in the fields. Their properties are similar to those of applying soybean cake or ammonium sulfate chemical fertilizers. The human manure and urine of such an agricultural cooperative throughout the year, if fully utilized, its fertility is equivalent to about 280,000 jin of soybean cake or 100,000 jin of ammonium sulfate chemical fertilizer, which cannot be ignored. To make full use of human manure and urine, in some areas, it is necessary to first improve toilets so that human manure and urine can be preserved, especially the preservation of urine. Toilets should be managed by special personnel, and manure tanks and pits should be covered to prevent fertility from running away and to prevent flies from breeding. Urine jars, pools, and buckets should also be managed by someone, and they should be collected regularly and transported to the fields for application.

Because urine is a quick-acting fertilizer, it can be used as top dressing. Applying 1,000 to 1,500 jin of human urine per mu can increase corn yield by more than 100 jin, which has great economic benefits. The application of urine should be uniform, and the amount should not be excessive. Except for severely saline-alkali land, it can be applied to general land, grains, cotton, and general vegetables, and the yield increase effect is very significant.

Now let's talk about composting green grass and green manure. As the saying goes, "Anything green is fertilizer." Green grass, like crops, also contains various fertilizer components.

China has the earliest experience in applying green manure. Now in the rice areas of Central China, South China, and Southwest China, there is a common habit of planting winter green manure such as milk vetch and purple cloud, which can obtain 2,000 to 4,000 jin of green manure per mu. Plowing it into the ground can greatly increase the yield of the next season of rice. In North China and Northwest China, there are also methods of intercropping sweet clover and other green manures. Alfalfa and purple locust can also be planted in open spaces for green manure or composting materials, and can also be used as feed.

Finally, please note, comrades, that China has a very large area, and the climate, soil, and crop types are different, so the methods of developing fertilizer sources and applying fertilizers are also very different. We should find ways according to the different conditions of each place and adapt to local conditions, and should not mechanically apply the experiences of other places.

    介绍一些关于肥料的知识
    中国农业科学院副研究员  陈尚谨
    编者按　春季生产开始了。为了帮助下放同志掌握一些农业科学常识，以便他们更好的钻研农业技术，我们特别约请了中国农业科学院的几位科学研究工作者，写了几篇文章。这些文章，将在这一栏内陆续发表。
    增加肥料是提高农作物单位面积产量的重要措施。现在我向大家介绍一些肥料方面的基本知识。
    俗语说的好：“种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混”。为什么粪有这么大作用呢？因为它里面含有植物生长所需要的各种肥料成分。简单的说，一般庄稼里含有碳、氧、氢、氮、磷、钾、钙、镁、硫、铁等十几种元素。有的元素可以从空气和水里面得到，有的需要从土壤里吸收。若是土壤供给能力不足，就需要人工来补充。
    拿小麦来说，如果每亩收获麦子一百斤，就要从土壤里面吸收氮素三斤、磷酸一斤半、氧化钾二斤半。若将每亩小麦产量从一百斤提高到五百斤，就要从土壤里面多吸收大约五倍的数量。但是，土壤里面氮、磷、钾三种元素的含量较少，不能充分满足农作物的需要。因此，就要施用肥料来满足庄稼的要求。粪里面氮、磷、钾那些养分都有了，此外，它还含有大量有机物质，能改良土壤性质，培养地力，像猪粪里面含有氮0.5％—0.8％，磷酸0.3％—0.5％，氧化钾0.2％—0.5％，有机物20％—40％。其他牲口粪、人粪尿、堆肥、绿肥等等，里面也含有各种养分，都是很好的肥料。
    现在谈一下猪圈粪的肥力问题，1956年曾在北京大钟寺农业社举行过这样的试验，每亩施用圈粪四千斤，当年玉米产量是三百六十二斤，不施用圈粪的，每亩产量是二百二十八斤，增加一百三十四斤。到1957年又增收玉米九十四斤，两年合计共增收玉米二百二十八斤。猪圈粪不仅对玉米效果很好，施用在小麦、棉花、谷子、水稻和其他庄稼上，肥力也是很好的。因此，应该多养猪积肥。
    除去猪粪以外，牛、羊、马、骡、驴等牲口粪，也是很大一项肥料来源，要加以妥善管理和施用。
    我国农村约有五亿多人口，人粪尿是一项很大的肥源。一个有一千户人家的农业社，平均按三千成年人计算，大约每人每年可攒粪一百八十斤、尿一千斤，一年约可产出大粪五十多万斤，尿三百多万斤。总计每人每年由粪中排出氮素一点八斤、磷酸一点四斤、氧化钾零点七斤；由尿中排出氮素五斤、磷酸一斤、氧化钾一点五斤。从以上数字来看，由尿中排出的肥料成分，远远超过粪中的肥分。这点很重要，请大家重视。人粪、人尿都是好的速效肥料，用到地里，见效很快。它们的性质和施用豆饼或硫酸铵化学肥料差不多。这样的一个农业社全年的人粪尿，若能充分利用，它的肥力就约相当于二十八万斤豆饼或十万斤硫酸铵化学肥料，不可忽视。要想充分利用人粪尿，在某些地区，先要改良厕所，使人粪、人尿都能保存起来，特别要注意尿的保存。厕所要有专人负责管理，粪缸、粪坑，要加盖盖好，不让肥力跑走，不让苍蝇繁殖。尿罐、尿池、尿桶也要有人负责，经常把它集中起来，运到田里施用。
    因为尿是速效肥料，可以用作追肥。每亩施用人尿一千到一千五百斤，可以增收玉米一百多斤，经济收益很大。施尿要均匀，用量不可过多，除了重盐碱的土地外，对一般土地，粮、棉和一般蔬菜，都可以施用，增产效果很大。
    现在再谈一谈青草沤粪和绿肥的问题。俗话说“见青就是粪”。青草和庄稼一样，里面也含有各种肥料成分。
    我国施用绿肥的经验最早。现在华中、华南、西南等水稻区普遍有种苕子、紫云英等冬季绿肥的习惯，每亩可以获得绿肥二千到四千斤，翻压到地里，对下季水稻的产量，就可以大大的提高。在华北、西北地区也有套种草木樨等绿肥的办法，在空地上还可以种上苜蓿、紫穗槐，用作绿肥或沤粪材料，还可以用作饲料。
    最后请各位同志们注意，我国面积很大，气候、土壤、作物种类不同，开辟肥源和施用肥料的方法，也就有很大不同。应该按各地不同的条件，因地制宜的想办法，不可机械搬用别处的经验。
