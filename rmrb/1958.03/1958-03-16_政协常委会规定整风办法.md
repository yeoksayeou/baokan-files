Xinhua News Agency, March 15th—The Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) recently passed the "Regulations of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Rectification Methods" at a meeting.

This regulation points out that the CPPCC organizations should actively carry out rectification. Through study and extensive debates, on the one hand, they should draw a clear line between themselves and the bourgeois rightists, break with the capitalist stance, and establish a socialist stance; on the other hand, they should overcome shortcomings in their work and improve the work of the CPPCC.

The regulations put forward the following rectification methods for the CPPCC National Committee: 1. After the anti-rightist struggle of the democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and other people's organizations has come to an end and turned to rectification, the National Committee should, in light of the fundamental and common issues related to politics, economy, culture, education, ethnicity, and CPPCC work in the debates of all parties, organize large-scale debates in a planned manner. 2. The scope of participation should be based on the principle of voluntarism, and widely absorb CPPCC members in Beijing, members of various working groups, members of study forums, central committee members of various democratic parties, non-party democratic persons, and relevant staff members of the CPPCC organs. 3. The documents to be studied should focus on Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Movement," and should also refer to other relevant important documents and newspaper editorials. 4. The method of carrying out rectification should be to adopt the methods of extensive airing of views, full expression of ideas, great debates, big-character posters, and symposiums, promote socialist democracy, distinguish between major rights and wrongs, and launch criticism and self-criticism. 5. The National Committee's rectification should widely solicit opinions from relevant people, absorb opinions on CPPCC work from the great debates, seriously deal with them, and improve the work of the CPPCC in the spirit of "rectifying while correcting."
