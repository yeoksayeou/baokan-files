    The Sichuan Province Cangxi County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Work Station recently experimented with injecting egg protein into pig thyroids. Results showed that the average daily weight gain of the pigs was about 1.5 jin (approximately 0.75 kg), and the fattening time was halved compared to ordinary pigs, thereby saving a significant amount of feed. This method is not suitable for piglets that have not yet developed their full body size.

    蛋白注射猪甲状腺
    四川省苍溪县畜牧兽医工作站最近试验用鸡蛋蛋白注射猪甲状腺，结果使毛猪平均每天长肉一斤半左右，育肥时间比一般毛猪缩短一半，从而节省大量饲料。这种方法不适用于尚未长成体形的小猪。
