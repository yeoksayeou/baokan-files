    Reported by Jilin Daily: The Shizuizi Copper Mine's concentrator plant increased its copper recovery rate to 97% in January and February, setting a national record. On this basis, the workers vigorously pursued further improvements, putting forward the slogan: "Work hard for a month to surpass the United States" (the US copper recovery rate is 98%). As a result, after only nine days, on the 10th and 11th of this month, they successively created recovery rates of 98.02% and 98.17%, reaching the world's advanced level.
    The Shizuizi Copper Mine's concentrator plant had a copper recovery rate of 96.16% in 1957. It is not easy for this old mine with half a century of history to increase from 96.16% to 98%. After January this year, the workers closely grasped the key to improving the recovery rate. Every 1% increase in the recovery rate will increase the country's copper production by several thousand jin per month. If the recovery rate is increased to 98%, it will create wealth worth 260,000 yuan for the country throughout the year.

    创全国纪录　登世界高峰
    石咀子铜矿采收率超过98％
    本报讯　据吉林日报报道：石咀子铜矿选矿厂1、2月份将铜采收率提高到97％，创造了全国最高纪录。在这一基础上，职工又奋起猛追，提出：“苦战一个月，赶过美国”（美国铜采收率为98％）的口号。结果只过了九天，于本月10、11两日连续创造采收率98.02％和98.17％的纪录，达到了世界的先进水平。
    石咀子铜矿选矿厂1957年铜采收率为96.16％，由96.16％提高到98％，对于这个具有半个世纪历史的老矿山是很不容易的。今年1月份以后，职工们就紧紧地抓住了提高采收率这个关键。采收率每提高1％，一个月就将给国家增产几千斤铜。如果采收率提高到98％，全年就将为国家创造价值26万元的财富。
