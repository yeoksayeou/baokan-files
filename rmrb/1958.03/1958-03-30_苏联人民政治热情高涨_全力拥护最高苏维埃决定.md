    The following is dispatched from Moscow on the 29th of this month: The people of the Soviet Union are paying very excited attention to the progress of the first session of the Fifth Supreme Soviet. The decision passed by the conference to appoint Comrade Khrushchev as Chairman of the Council of Ministers and entrust him with presenting the list of the government, as well as the report made by Comrade Khrushchev, are being hotly discussed in the vast rural areas and urban industrial enterprises. The Soviet people are unanimously determined to support the decisions of the Supreme Soviet with practical actions.

    Many workers at the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow gathered during their lunch break to discuss the matter. Senior technician Badayev said, "The Supreme Soviet's appointment of Khrushchev as Chairman of the Council of Ministers is a completely correct decision that we fully support. We Soviet people all know that Khrushchev is an outstanding state activist who is loyal to the cause of the Party and loyal to the consolidation of our national endeavors. We respect him and love him." Dupini, a well-known advanced producer at the "Red Viborg District Resident" factory in Leningrad, said, "We warmly congratulate Khrushchev on his appointment as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. We will fully support him. We are completely confident that, under the leadership of the Party, and during his term of office, greater achievements will be created in international affairs and domestic construction."

    At the same time, one hundred and five economic zones are using overfulfilling the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule as a gift to the Supreme Soviet meeting. Economic zones such as Kiev and Khabarovsk completed their production plans approximately one week ahead of schedule. The Stavropol oil workers overfulfilled the production competition tasks they proposed on the first day of the conference. On this day, they completed the first quarter's production tasks ahead of schedule, producing thousands of tons of extra oil for the country. The Altai Territory agricultural machinery manufacturing plant overfulfilled the production of agricultural machinery worth millions of rubles in advance, supporting the rising needs of rural production. Employees of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant and the Saratov Metallurgical Plant have also been swept up in the production competition craze.
