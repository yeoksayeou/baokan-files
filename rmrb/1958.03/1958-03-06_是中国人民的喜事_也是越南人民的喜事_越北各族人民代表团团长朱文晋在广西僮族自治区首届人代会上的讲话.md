Comrade Deputy Prime Minister, esteemed delegates:

The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a glorious and historically significant day for the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, and a happy event for the Chinese people; at the same time, we also regard it as a happy event for our Vietnamese people.

Our delegation of people from all ethnic groups of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam feels very honored to participate in this conference. On behalf of the 870,000 people of the thirteen ethnic groups in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region, we extend warm congratulations to the conference and to all the delegates, and through you, to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the people of all ethnic groups of the great People's Republic of China.

The people of Vietnam and China have had close relations in history, economy, culture, and other aspects for a long time, especially the people of all ethnic groups in Viet Bac and Guangxi. People have many things in common in terms of geography, economy, language, and customs. In the border areas, they often interact like brothers. The revolutionary movement in Vietnam is closely related to the revolutionary movement in China. We have a common enemy—imperialism and feudalism—and the people of our two countries are following the path of Marxism-Leninism. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have won the victory of the revolution and are carrying out socialist construction; under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people have successfully carried out the August Revolution of 1945, won victory in the struggle against foreign aggression, and are today intensifying the consolidation of the completely liberated North, making the North gradually transition to a socialist society, and laying a solid foundation for the struggle for national reunification.

In the process of national liberation struggle, the Vietnamese people have continuously received the warm support of the fraternal Chinese people. Today, in the cause of peaceful construction, we have further received the generous and selfless assistance of the Chinese people. The people of Viet Bac will never forget the full support of the people of Guangxi to us in the difficult years of resisting the aggressors and in the current cause of peaceful construction.

The Guangxi Nationalities Delegation left a deep impression on us when they went to participate in our Viet Bac Autonomous Region founding conference in August 1956. Our coming to participate in the founding conference of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a good opportunity to further strengthen our unity. We have been warmly welcomed and treated like brothers everywhere we go. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to all comrades and friends. We know that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have overfulfilled the first five-year plan and are entering the second five-year plan with full confidence. The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction. For more than a year, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have been actively carrying out the preparatory work for the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In this exciting atmosphere, industrial and agricultural production has been vigorously promoted, national culture has been developed, and the people's living standards have been improved. We warmly congratulate the great victory of the fraternal Chinese people and the achievements made by the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi in the socialist construction competition. The outstanding ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China have united the great Chinese people of all ethnic groups, enabling the revolution to succeed and the cause of socialist construction to achieve brilliant achievements. Today, the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a further indication of the new great victory in implementing the ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China, the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao. It will further develop and strengthen the relationship of unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups, further give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of the autonomous region, and strive to achieve greater progress in politics, economy, and culture, and vigorously promote the continuous development of socialist construction. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the construction cause of the Autonomous Region in the future will surely provide us with valuable experience in carrying out socialist construction in minority areas.

Since the restoration of peace in our country three years, under the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, we have put all our efforts into overcoming all kinds of difficulties, successfully realized the national plan, restored the economy, and initially developed our culture, and have begun to implement a three-year construction plan this year, the purpose of which is to consolidate the North and gradually transition to a socialist society. Our Viet Bac people established the Autonomous Region in August 1956. For more than a year, we have achieved preliminary results: we have further strengthened ethnic unity, promoted agricultural and handicraft production, developed universal education and literacy education, and developed health services, thus improving people's lives to a certain extent. The people of all ethnic groups in Viet Bac are more jubilant and firmly support the ethnic policies of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, and will work harder to build our Autonomous Region, making it more prosperous day by day, and making positive contributions to consolidating our North and gradually transitioning to a socialist society, so as to lay a solid foundation for the struggle for national reunification.

Respected Comrade Deputy Prime Minister, esteemed delegates, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have the virtue of hard work and the tradition of heroic revolutionary struggle; Guangxi has vast land, rich resources, and the enthusiastic support of the great People's Republic of China, with more than 600 million people of all ethnic groups, coupled with the rich experience of fraternal ethnic autonomous regions, therefore the construction of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will surely achieve great achievements, and rapidly make the material and cultural life of all ethnic groups better day by day. The great People's Republic of China is a strong guarantee for consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The people of all ethnic groups in China are making brilliant contributions to building their glorious socialist motherland. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will surely enable the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi to make greater contributions.

I wish all the delegates good health, and the conference a complete success!
I wish the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region unity, and build the Autonomous Region to become more prosperous day by day!
Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in Vietnam and China!
Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao!

    是中国人民的喜事  也是越南人民的喜事
    越北各族人民代表团团长朱文晋在广西僮族自治区首届人代会上的讲话亲爱的副总理同志：各位代表：
    广西僮族自治区的成立是自治区各族人民光荣的有历史意义的日子，是中国人民的喜事；同时我们也把它当作我们越南人民的喜事。
    我们越南民主共和国越北民族自治区人民代表团能参加这次大会，感到非常荣幸。我们谨代表越北自治区十三个民族的八十七万人民，向大会、各位代表致以热烈的祝贺，并通过各位代表向广西僮族自治区和伟大的中华人民共和国各族人民致以最亲切的祝贺。
    越中两国人民之间，很久以来就在历史、经济、文化等各方面有着密切的关系，特别是越北各族人民和广西各族人民之间，这种关系更加密切。彼此的人们在地理、经济、语言、风俗习惯等方面，有着许多共同之处，在边境地区，他们之间像兄弟般的经常来往。越南的革命运动与中国的革命运动，有着密切的关系，我们有共同的敌人——帝国主义和封建主义，我们两国人民都遵循着马克思列宁主义的道路前进。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下已经获得了革命的胜利，并且正在进行社会主义建设；越南人民在越南劳动党的领导下，已胜利地进行了1945年八月革命，在抵抗外国侵略的斗争中获得了胜利，今天正在加紧巩固完全解放了的北方，使北方逐步地过渡到社会主义社会，为争取祖国统一的斗争奠定牢固的基础。
    在民族解放斗争过程中，越南人民不断地得到兄弟般的中国人民的热情支持，今天在和平建设事业中，我们更进一步得到中国人民慷慨无私的援助。我们越北人民永远不能忘记在反抗侵略者的艰苦斗争年代里，并且在目前的和平建设事业中，广西人民对我们的全力支持。
    广西民族代表团于1956年8月前往参加我们越北自治区成立大会，给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们这次来参加广西僮族自治区的成立大会，是进一步加强我们之间的团结的良好机会。我们到处受到热情的欢迎，和像兄弟样的接待，我们谨向各位同志、各位朋友致以衷心的感谢。我们知道，中国人民在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛主席的领导下，已经超额完成了第一个五年计划，并且满怀信心地进入了第二个五年计划。广西各族人民在社会主义建设事业中，获得了辉煌的成就。一年多以来，广西各族人民在积极地进行广西僮族自治区成立的筹备工作。在这一兴奋的气氛中，有力地推动了工农业生产，发展了民族文化，提高了人民的生活水平。我们热烈地祝贺兄弟般的中国人民的伟大胜利，祝贺广西各族人民在社会主义建设事业中展开竞赛所获得的成就。中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府的卓越的民族政策，已经团结了伟大的中国各族人民，使得革命成功和社会主义建设事业获得辉煌成就。今天广西僮族自治区的成立，是进一步标志着贯彻中国共产党、中华人民共和国和毛主席的民族政策的新的伟大胜利，它将进一步发展和加强各民族之间团结互助的关系，并进一步发挥自治区人民的积极性、创造性，争取在政治、经济、文化等方面获得更大的进步，有力地促进社会主义建设事业不断的向前发展。广西僮族自治区的成立，以及今后自治区的建设事业，一定将给我们提供有关在少数民族地区进行社会主义建设的宝贵经验。
    我国人民自和平恢复三年以来，在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的正确领导下，拿出了全部的力量克服了种种的困难，胜利地实现了国家的计划，恢复了经济，和初步发展了我们的文化，并且从今年起开始执行三年建设计划，目的在于巩固北方、逐步地过渡到社会主义社会。我们越北人民在1956年8月成立自治区，一年多以来，已经获得了初步的成绩：进一步加强了民族的团结，推动了农业和手工业的生产，发展了普及教育和平民教育，发展了卫生事业，因而在一定程度上改善了人民的生活。越北各族人民更加欢欣鼓舞，坚决地拥护越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的民族政策，并且将更加努力地来建设我们的自治区，使得它更日益繁荣起来，为巩固我们的北方、使北方逐步地过渡到社会主义社会作出积极的贡献，以便为争取祖国统一的斗争奠定牢固的基础。
  敬爱的副总理同志，各位代表，广西各族人民有着辛勤劳动的美德，有着英勇的革命斗争的传统；广西有广阔的土地，丰富的资源，又有伟大的中华人民共和国六亿多的各族人民的热情支持，加上兄弟民族自治区的丰富经验，因此广西僮族自治区的建设必将获得巨大的成就，迅速地使得各族人民的物质及文化生活日益美好。伟大的中华人民共和国是巩固亚洲和世界和平的有力保证，中国各族人民正在为建设自己光荣的社会主义祖国作出辉煌的贡献，广西僮族自治区的成立，必将使广西各族人民作出更大的贡献。
    祝各位代表身体健康，祝大会圆满成功！
    祝广西僮族自治区各族人民团结，把自治区建设得日益繁荣！越中各族人民大团结万岁！光荣的中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
