    Democratic Party Professors Open Their Hearts
    Recently, in order to promote the self-ideological remolding of teachers, Peking University's various democratic parties convened a mobilization meeting for their members. Many teachers who are members of democratic parties stepped forward to "ignite themselves," expressing their determination to remold themselves and open their hearts to the Party and the people. Such promotional meetings are very beneficial for accelerating the current self-ideological remolding movement among teachers.
    Most members of democratic parties are bourgeois intellectuals. Although they played a progressive role in the past democratic revolutionary movement, and have made progress in the various political movements over the past eight years, many still harbor extremely serious bourgeois individualistic ideas. Such ideas are incompatible with today's socialist society. The foundation has changed, and the superstructure must also change. Everything is in motion and progressing. People's thoughts must also be in motion and progressing. Democratic parties should advance along with the advance of socialism.
    Currently, bourgeois individualistic thinking is already hindering the great leap forward in universities and colleges. Professors of democratic parties should rise up, strive for the top, and become advanced individuals in the ideological remolding movement.
    The ideological remolding of bourgeois intellectuals is an arduous process. It is not enough to merely have the desire for remolding. If one does not resolve ideological concerns, "ignite oneself," and resolutely throw oneself into the movement to temper oneself thoroughly, it will not work.
    Peking University's approach is very good. Teachers should quickly break down their concerns, "ignite themselves," and expose their shortcomings and mistakes in their work and thoughts. In this movement, whoever walks ahead will be able to achieve a more profound transformation, thereby reaching a state of ease and vitality.

    民主党派教授们交心
    最近，北京大学各民主党派为了促进教师们的自我思想改造，召开了各民主党派成员的誓师大会。许多民主党派成员的教师起来引火烧身，表达自我改造和向党、向人民交心的决心。这种促进的大会对加速当前教师们的自我改造运动是有很大好处的。
    民主党派成员中间大多数人是资产阶级知识分子，在过去的民主革命运动中，虽然起过进步作用，八年来，在历次政治运动中，也有了进步，但是许多人资产阶级个人主义思想还极严重。这种思想对今天的社会主义社会来说是不相容的。基础变了，上层建筑也必须变。任何事物都是运动着的，都是前进着的。人的思想，也必须是运动着，前进着的。民主党派应当随着社会主义的前进而前进。
    目前，资产阶级个人主义思想已经是高等学校大跃进的阻碍，民主党派的教授们，应当起来，力争上游，成为思想改造运动中的先进者。
    资产阶级知识分子的思想改造是一个艰巨的过程，光有改造的要求，如果不解决思想上的许多顾虑，引火烧身，决心投入运动中把自己千锤百炼的锻炼一下，是不行的。
    北京大学民主党派的作法很好。教师们应当迅速打破顾虑，引火烧身，揭露自己在工作和思想上的缺点和错误。在这个运动中，谁走在越前面，谁就越能够得到比较深刻的改造，从而达到心情舒畅，生动活泼的境地。
