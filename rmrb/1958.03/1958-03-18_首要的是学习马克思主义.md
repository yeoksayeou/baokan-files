Title: The Most Important Thing is to Study Marxism

The big-character posters at Peking University these past few days raise many questions about where the Philosophy Department is headed. This question is well raised. To achieve a great leap forward, this question must first be resolved. Over the past few years, our Philosophy Department has done some work; however, due to the large amount of bourgeois ideology existing within us and the unclear direction of running the department, our work has not been done enough, nor well enough. For example, our Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section has carried out scientific research work relatively well, but since 1952, it has only written eighty-eight papers, averaging less than 10,000 words per person per year. The lecture notes on the history of philosophy are still stuck in the "labeling" stage. The Western Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section focuses on translating materials. Materials are necessary, but without prefaces and annotations, they become raw materials without viewpoints. The Logic Teaching and Research Section is not interested in formal logic and avoids the study of dialectical logic. The Psychology Teaching and Research Section is still pursuing American standards for certain settings. Whether to take the capitalist road or the socialist road is not yet clear in everyone's mind.

The situation of "valuing the past and belittling the present" is also very serious. For example, the Teaching and Research Section of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism cannot offer courses in historical materialism, let alone specialized courses. In addition, some people are unwilling to study Marxism and want to use the old ways to cope. Therefore, the primary issue is to have the desire to study Marxism and transform ideology, to launch criticism and self-criticism, and to abandon bourgeois ideas about running schools. Without breaking through this point, a great leap forward is impossible.

I haven't given much thought to how the entire philosophical community can achieve a great leap forward. There are many things to be done in the philosophical community. For example, systematically translating world-renowned philosophical works is an important task. We must not only tap potential but also systematically train qualified translation cadres. As natural sciences and technological sciences take a great leap forward, philosophy and social sciences should take an even greater leap forward. The past situation has been very unsatisfactory. The twenty key projects in philosophy and social sciences for this year, drafted by the Science Planning Commission, are all necessary and achievable. The problem lies in having concrete organizational measures to guarantee them. Comrade Chen Boda's proposition of "valuing the present and belittling the past, learning while doing" should be the fundamental direction and fundamental method for our philosophy and social science workers to make a great leap forward.

    首要的是学习马克思主义
    郑昕
    这几天北京大学贴的大字报很多，许多同学提出了哲学系走向何处去的问题。这个问题提得很好。要跃进首先得解决这个问题。过去几年，我们哲学系做了一些工作；但是由于我们的资产阶级思想大量存在和办系的方向不明确，我们的工作做得不够多，不够好。例如，我们中国哲学史教研室是科学研究工作开展得比较好的，但是从1952年以来只写了八十八篇论文，平均每人每年还不到一万字。哲学史的讲稿，也还停留在“贴标签”阶段。西方哲学史教研室重点工作是翻译资料。资料是必要的，但是没有译序和注释，这就成了没有观点的素材。逻辑教研室对形式逻辑不感兴趣，又避开辩证逻辑的研究。心理学教研室对某些设置还在追求美国标准。是走资本主义的道路，还是走社会主义的道路，还不是每个人心中都明确的。
    “厚古薄今”的情况，也非常严重。例如辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义教研室便开不出历史唯物主义的课程，更不用说专门化课程了。此外，有些人还不愿意学习马克思主义，想用旧的一套来应付。所以，首要的问题是要有学习马克思主义和改造思想的愿望，展开批评和自我批评，抛弃资产阶级办学思想。不突破这一点，跃进是不可能的。
    整个哲学界如何跃进，我还没有很好考虑。哲学界要做的事非常之多，例如，有计划地翻译世界哲学名著，就是一项重要的工作。我们不但要挖掘潜力，同时还要有计划地培养合乎规格的翻译干部。自然科学和技术科学大跃进，哲学社会科学更应该大跃进。过去的情况很不能令人满意。这次科学规划委员会所拟订的哲学社会科学本年度二十个重点项目，都是必需实现和可能实现的。问题在于要有具体组织措施来保证。陈伯达同志所提的“厚今薄古、边干边学”，应该是我们哲学社会科学工作者跃进的根本方向和根本方法。
