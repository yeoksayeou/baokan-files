The Realistic Significance of Makarenko's Educational Thought
Director of Education History Teaching and Research Group, Northwest Normal University, Chen Zhendong

Today marks the 70th anniversary of the birth of the outstanding Soviet educator Anton Makarenko. As we emphasize political and ideological education, advocate diligence and thrift in running schools, promote labor education, and overcome conservative thinking today, commemorating Makarenko is of even greater significance.

Anton Semyonovich Makarenko was born on March 13, 1888 (March 1st according to the old Russian calendar) in the railway factory town of Belopolye, Kharkov Province, to a painter's family. He began his teaching career at the age of seventeen. In 1914, Makarenko, with rich teaching experience, was admitted to the Poltava Teachers' College and, after graduating in 1917, was appointed principal of a higher elementary school. From this time on, Makarenko devoted himself to seeking new educational methods and new paths in pedagogy. In the autumn of 1920, Makarenko was commissioned by the Poltava Provincial People's Committee of Education to open a juvenile offender education center. At that time, not only were material conditions very poor, but the students sent there refused any discipline and education, and opposed any participation in labor. However, Makarenko, with an indomitable and persevering spirit, implemented ideological education, and worked with respect for the students' attitudes, finally enabling the students to accept his guidance. In just over three years, the education center became a model educational institution. From the end of 1927 to 1935, Makarenko presided over another commune, the Dzerzhinsky Commune, established for homeless children. Here, he further implemented an educational system that combined teaching with productive labor. Under his organization, the students relied on their own labor, through a half-work, half-study format, to create enormous wealth for the country, while also achieving complete self-sufficiency for the commune, enabling a collective of six hundred people to live a prosperous and happy life, and to study with peace of mind, all without requiring a penny of state subsidy. He established industrial enterprises for the commune that manufactured electric drills and cameras with complete sets of complex modern technology equipment. He transformed batches of unfortunate children into socialist new people with secondary school culture, skilled production techniques, and high communist moral qualities. In sixteen years, Makarenko, with innovative educational methods and principles, transformed three thousand homeless children, making them capable and virtuous active laborers in various positions in the Soviet state. Among them, many were admitted to universities and research institutes, becoming Soviet generals, engineers, doctors, scientists, teachers, journalists, etc.

In his later years, Makarenko devoted himself to literary activities, making artistic descriptions and theoretical summaries of his rich educational experience. On February 1, 1939, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor by the Soviet government. Unfortunately, two months later, this outstanding educator died of a heart attack.

Makarenko's educational legacy is extremely rich. Here, we will only introduce aspects related to ideological education, diligence and thrift in running schools, and labor education.

The juvenile offender education center that Makarenko was commissioned to open in September 1920 had only forty hectares of land unsuitable for cultivation, five dilapidated houses, one hundred and fifty poods of rye flour, and limited funding. The students sent to him were a group of idle, robbery-prone, and thieving juvenile delinquents. But Makarenko did not bow down to difficulties and, after great efforts, established preliminary discipline. On this basis, Makarenko organized them to engage in various forms of labor. By 1925, they had harvested enough grain and vegetables from the fields, and could provide themselves with enough milk and meat, and the students were living comfortably and well-fed. Not far from this juvenile offender education center was the Kuryazh Education Center, where more than four hundred children were hopelessly corrupted. By 1926, it was impossible to continue running it, so the People's Committee of Education transferred it to Makarenko's management. In May of that year, Makarenko led one hundred and twenty students from the Gorky Education Center, leaving behind the comfortable and beautiful campus they had built with their own hands, and moved into the dirty and dilapidated Kuryazh Education Center. Makarenko reorganized the old and new students, worked together, and rebuilt the new Gorky Education Center from scratch. A year later, the education center's production was able to supply the needs of four hundred and fifty people, the students also received the compulsory education they deserved, and the face of the Kuryazh Education Center was completely new. They not only ate well and dressed well, but also made the school economically sufficient, purchased books for the library, and also bought musical instruments, movie projectors, etc.

The history of the Dzerzhinsky Commune also fully demonstrates Makarenko's outstanding talent in running schools diligently and thriftily. From the day it was established, this commune did not receive a penny of funding from the state. In the early stages, they lived a very hard life. In order to maintain the children's lives, Makarenko established a woodworking factory, organized students to participate in labor, and accepted a large number of orders from outside. In the second year, the factory's surplus increased month by month, and the commune's finances were not only balanced, but also had savings. In 1931, Makarenko used the accumulated funds to build a metal manufacturing factory with modern technical equipment, which could produce very complex machines that were previously entirely imported. The famous Soviet ФД brand electric drills and ф3Д brand cassette cameras were produced in this factory. The workers who manufactured these precision products that required a high degree of accuracy were Makarenko's students—young men in their teens who had once fallen into vagrancy and juvenile delinquency.

One of the most important principles upon which Makarenko's brilliant educational achievements relied was education through labor. He pointed out: "In educational work, labor should be one of the most important fundamental factors." He also said: "Correct and rational Soviet education, if it is not labor education, is completely unimaginable." At the same time, Makarenko also opposed the "one-sided enthusiasm for manual labor" that neglected the organization of education. He believed that "labor" does not naturally bring about "education." Makarenko said: "Under no circumstances will labor have educational benefits if it is not accompanied by parallel education, by parallel political and social education, and will become a useless process." Based on this view, Makarenko, whenever giving students a labor task, considered how to enable them to receive rich education through the labor process. He believed that if children were entrusted with doing something that only required them to expend muscular strength, the educational significance of this labor was very limited. Children should be allowed the right to choose their own way of completing labor tasks, which is of great benefit in cultivating children's conscious, active, and independent engagement in work. At the same time, he also advocated cultivating children's concern for the collective, cultivating a sense of responsibility and planning initiative, and cultivating excellent moral qualities. Makarenko proved in practice that productive labor does not hinder learning. The members of the Dzerzhinsky Commune all worked four hours a day, and spent the rest of their time studying at a ten-year secondary school. The students he educated understood production, understood production organization, and also understood the production process, and also achieved excellent academic results.

Makarenko's educational practice and educational theory achieved such remarkable results because they were inseparable from his innovative and courageous spirit. He bravely broke through the outdated views left in those pedagogies, and resolutely and creatively provided many new methods and various new forms of educational organization. His creative labor made a significant contribution to the development of Soviet pedagogy. Today, under the correct leadership of the Party, we are reforming the direction of education. In this regard, Makarenko's educational practice and educational theory will give us novel and profound enlightenment. Makarenko's rich educational legacy, like a bright light, illuminates our advancing educational path. We should strive to learn from Makarenko, and we should be, like Makarenko, innovators in education.

    马卡连柯教育思想的现实意义
    西北师范学院教育史教研组主任　陈震东
    今天是卓越的苏联教育家马卡连柯七十周年诞辰纪念日。正当我们强调政治思想教育、提倡勤俭办校、劳动教育，克服保守思想的今天，来纪念马卡连柯是有加倍意义的。
    安东·谢苗诺维奇·马卡连柯1888年3月13日（旧俄历3月1日）生于哈尔科夫省别洛波里城铁路工厂的一个油漆工人的家里，从十七岁起，他就开始了教师生活。1914年富有教学经验的马卡连柯又考入了波尔塔夫师范专科学校，1917年毕业后，被任命为高等小学校长。从这时起，马卡连柯即专心致志寻求新的教育方法和新的教育学的道路。1920年秋，马卡连柯受波尔塔夫省教育人民委员会之命，开办一所童犯教养院。当时不仅物质条件很差，送去的学童拒绝任何纪律和教育，并反对参加任何劳动。可是马卡连柯以不屈不挠、坚忍不拔的精神，贯彻了思想教育，尊重学童们的态度从事工作，终于使学童们接受自己的教导。仅三年多的时间，教养院竟成为一所模范的教育机关。1927年末到1935年，马卡连柯主持另外一所为流浪儿童而设的捷尔任斯基公社。在这里他更进一步实现了教学与生产劳动相结合的教育体系。在他的组织之下，学童们靠自己的劳动，通过半工半读的形式，一面为国家创造了巨大的财富，一面做到了公社全部自给自足，使六百人的集体过着富裕幸福的生活，并能安心学习，同时，不需要国家分文的补助。他为公社建立了制造电钻和照像机有全套复杂现代技术设备的工业企业，他把一批一批不幸儿童，教育成为具有中学文化、具有熟练的生产技术、具有高度的共产主义道德品质的社会主义新人。在十六年间，马卡连柯以崭新的教育方法和原则，改造了三千流浪儿童，使他们成为苏维埃国家各种岗位上德才兼备的积极劳动者。其中还有不少人考进了大学和研究院，成为苏维埃将军、工程师、医生、科学家、教师、记者等。
    在晚年，马卡连柯致力于文学活动，把自己的丰富教育经验，作了艺术的描述和理论的总结。1939年2月1日他荣获苏联政府劳动红旗勋章。可惜，在两个月以后，这位卓越的教育家因心脏病逝世。
    马卡连柯的教育遗产是极丰富的。在这里我们仅就有关思想教育、勤俭办学、劳动教育等方面介绍一下。
    1920年9月马卡连柯被委任开办的童犯教养院，当时的物质条件，只有一块四十公顷不适宜耕种的土地，五所破烂不堪的房子，一百五十普特黑麦粉和一笔有限的经费。给他送去的学童是一批游手好闲、惯于抢劫偷盗的犯罪青少年。可是马卡连柯并没有在困难面前低头，经过了很大的努力，才建立了初步的纪律。在这样基础上，马卡连柯组织他们进行各种劳动。到1925年，他们从田地里已收获到足够的粮食和蔬菜，能供给自己足够的牛奶和肉类，学童们过着安适而温饱的生活。距离这个童犯教养院不远的地方，有一所库里亚日教养院，里面四百多个孩子都腐化得无可救药。到1926年实在无法办下去了，于是教育人民委员会把它移交给马卡连柯管理。这一年的5月，马卡连柯带领着一百二十个高尔基教养院的学童，离开了用自己双手建设起来舒适而优美的校园，迁入了肮脏残缺的库里亚日教养院。马卡连柯把新旧学童们重新组织起来，共同进行劳动，从头建设起新的高尔基教养院。一年之后，教养院的生产已经能供给四百五十人的需要，学童们也受到了应受的义务教育，库里亚日教养院的面貌已完全一新了。他们不仅吃得好、穿得好，而且使学校经济充足，为图书馆购置了书籍，还购了乐器、电影机等。
    捷尔任斯基公社的历史也充分说明马卡连柯勤俭办学的卓越才能。这个公社从成立之日起，没有向国家领过一文钱的经费。初期，过着非常艰苦的生活。为了维持孩子们的生活，马卡连柯建立一所木工厂，组织学童们参加劳动，并接受外面大量的订货。第二年，工厂的盈余逐月增加，公社的经费不但能收支平衡，而且有了积蓄。1931年，马卡连柯用积蓄下来的经费建立了一所有现代技术设备的金属制造业工厂，可以生产以前完全是进口货的很复杂的机器。苏联有名ФД牌电钻和ф3Д牌等卡式照像机就是在这个工厂里生产出来的。制造这些需要有高度准确性的精密产品的工人，就是马卡连柯的学童——曾经一度堕落为流浪者和童犯的十来岁小伙子。
    马卡连柯的辉煌教育成绩所依靠的最重要原则之一，是在劳动中教育。他指出：“在教育工作上，劳动应当是最重要的根本因素之一。”他又说：“正确合理的苏维埃教育，如果不是劳动的教育，那完全是不可想像的”。同时，马卡连柯也反对忽视教育的组织而”片面地热衷于亲手劳动的偏向。他认为“劳动”并不自然而然地带来“教育”的结果。马卡连柯说：“在任何情况下，劳动如果没有与其并行的教育、没有与其并行的政治的和社会的教育就不会有教育的好处，会成为不起作用的一种过程”。基于这种观点，马卡连柯每逢给学童们一件劳动任务时，都考虑到如何使他们通过劳动过程受到丰富的教育。他认为如果委托儿童们做一件事，只要求他们消耗肌肉上的力量，这种劳动教育意义是很有限的。对于完成劳动任务的方式，应当允许有自己选择的权利，这对培养儿童自觉地、积极地和独立地从事工作有很大的益处。同时，他还主张培养儿童关心集体，培养责任感和计划性主动性，培养优良的道德品质。马卡连柯在实践中证明了，生产劳动并不妨碍学习。捷尔任斯基公社的社员们，一律每天工作四小时，其余的时间到十年制中学去学习。他教育出来的学生，懂得生产、懂得生产组织，也懂得生产过程，而且学习成绩优良。
    马卡连柯在教育实践中和在教育理论上，所以有如此卓越的成绩，是和他的革新与勇敢精神分不开的。他勇敢地突破了那些教育学中留下的陈腐观点，坚决创造性地提供了许多新的方法和各种新的教育组织形式。他这一创造性的劳动，对苏维埃教育学的发展有了重大的贡献。今天在党的正确领导之下，我们正在革新教育方向。在这方面，马卡连柯的教育实践和教育理论会给我们新颖而深刻的启示。马卡连柯丰富的教育遗产，像一座明灯照耀着我们前进的教育道路。我们应当努力向马卡连柯学习，我们应当和马卡连柯一样，做一个教育事业的革新者。
