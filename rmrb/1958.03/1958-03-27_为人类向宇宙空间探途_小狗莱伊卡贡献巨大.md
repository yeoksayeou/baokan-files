Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th: According to the information obtained, Laika, the first animal to fly into outer space with the Soviet Union's second artificial earth satellite, not only satisfactorily survived the difficult period from the satellite's launch to entering orbit, but also adapted well to the various conditions during the satellite's orbital flight.

This was stated by Academician Topchiev, Academic Secretary-General of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, at the annual meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences that opened on the 25th.

In his summary report on the work of the Academy of Sciences in 1957, Topchiev spoke about the significance of the Soviet Union's use of animals for space flight experiments, saying: This is a unique and very successful experiment in the world.

Topchiev said that preliminary results of observations of Laika proved that, from a biological point of view, the effect of acceleration on the animal during the most difficult stage of the satellite's launch and entry into orbit was extended along the chest towards the back. The flight of the Soviet Union's second satellite involved acceleration, and this acceleration value exceeded the acceleration of gravity several times. It has now been determined that in addition to the effect of acceleration, the vibration of the rocket engine when it is started and the noise it emits at certain times also have an impact on the animal.

It can be seen from the translated coded data that, immediately after the satellite was launched, the dog's heart contraction rate immediately increased by about two times compared to normal. Later, as the effect of acceleration continued and increased, the dog's heart rate gradually decreased.

Based on the analysis of the electrocardiogram, we did not find any signs of illness in the dog. In addition, we also recorded a typical condition of accelerated heartbeat in the dog (i.e., sinus tachycardia).

Due to the effect of acceleration, the dog's sensation of sudden weight gain became greater and greater, and its breathing became shorter and more frequent. At high altitude, Laika's breathing rate exceeded two to three times its original rate. Topchiev said that when the satellite was orbiting, the dog was in a state of weightlessness in terms of dynamics. Its breathing and heart rate gradually decreased, slowly approaching the original rates, and although the dog was in a very unusual state of weightlessness, its activity functions remained normal.

The experiment with Laika showed that the unique factor of weightlessness itself did not cause significant and lasting changes in the dog's physiological functions, and its blood circulation and respiratory function values were normal during weightlessness.

    为人类向宇宙空间探途
    小狗莱伊卡贡献巨大
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：根据获得的资料证明，随着苏联第二个人造地球卫星飞上宇宙空间的第一个动物——小狗莱伊卡不仅令人满意地度过了从卫星发射到进入轨道的困难时期，而且很好地适应了卫星沿轨道飞行时的各种条件。
    这是苏联科学院主席团学术秘书长托普切夫院士在25日开幕的苏联科学院年会上所说的。
    托普切夫在他这份科学院1957年工作总结报告中谈到苏联利用动物作宇宙飞行试验的意义时说：这是世界上独一无二而又很成功的一次试验。
    托普切夫说，对莱伊卡观察的初步结果证明，从生物学观点看来，在卫星开始发射到它进入轨道这个最困难的阶段中，加速度对动物的影响是沿着胸部向背部扩展的。苏联第二个卫星的飞行是加速度的，这个加速度的数值超过重力加速度好几倍。现在已经确定，除了加速度的影响外，火箭发动机开动时的振动和它在某些时候发出的噪音对动物也有影响。
    从译出的密码资料看出，卫星刚发射时，小狗的心脏收缩次数立刻比平时约增加了两倍。后来，随着加速度作用的继续和不断增大，小狗的心脏跳动次数就逐渐减少。
    根据对心动电流图的分析，我们没有发现小狗有任何疾病征兆。此外，我们还记录了小狗心跳加速的典型状况（即窦性心动过速）。
    由于加速度的影响，小狗对体重突增的感受越来越大，它的呼吸越来越短促和频繁。在高空，莱伊卡的呼吸次数超过了原来的两倍到三倍。托普切夫说，当卫星沿轨道运行时，小狗就处于动力学上所说的失重状态。它的呼吸和心跳次数逐渐减少，慢慢接近原来的次数，虽然小狗处于失重的非常状况下，它的活动机能仍然是正常的。
    用莱伊卡进行的试验表明，失重这一独特因素本身并没有引起小狗生理机能上重大而持久的变化，在失重期间，它的血液循环和呼吸机能数值都是正常的。
