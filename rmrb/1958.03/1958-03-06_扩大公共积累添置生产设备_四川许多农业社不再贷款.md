Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Special Dispatch: Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province have adjusted the relationship between accumulation and consumption through rectification, and have generally expanded public accumulation. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, the public accumulation retained by general agricultural cooperatives has increased from the originally planned 3% of total income to more than 5%. In Neijiang, Nanchong, and other regions, the public accumulation retained by agricultural cooperatives has reached 40% of the increased production last year. The public accumulation retained by agricultural cooperatives in the Suining region is more than the total of the previous two years.

After the increase in public accumulation in various agricultural cooperatives, the capacity for expanded reproduction has been significantly enhanced. This year, about one-third of the agricultural cooperatives in the province will not need to borrow from the state during the spring plowing period, and can solve the problem of production funds themselves. Many agricultural cooperatives have undertaken more basic construction and purchased more means of production than in any previous year. Tools such as water pumps and generators, which general agricultural cooperatives could not afford in the past, are now being purchased in large quantities by agricultural cooperatives. Some agricultural cooperatives in Renshou County raised 100,000 yuan in cash at one time and sent it to the county, requesting help to build sixteen hydroelectric power stations and fourteen hydraulic power stations. Collective sideline occupations in various agricultural cooperatives have also developed vigorously. Recently, everyone has been busy rushing to build pigsties, cattle pens, and feed processing plants, presenting a scene of vigorous development everywhere.

    扩大公共积累添置生产设备
    四川许多农业社不再贷款
    本报特约新华社成都讯　四川省各地农业社通过整改调节了积累和消费的关系，普遍扩大了公共积累。据有关部门初步统计，一般农业社公共积累的提留都由原计划占总收入3％左右，提高到5％以上。内江、南充等专区农业社提留的公共积累已达到去年增产部分40％，遂宁专区各农业社提留的公共积累比以往两年提留的总和还多。
    各农业社公共积累增加后，扩大再生产的能力显著增强。全省今年约有三分之一左右的农业社在春耕期间不向国家贷款，即可解决生产资金问题。许多农业社兴修的基本建设和购置的生产资料，比过去任何一年都多。往年一般农业社无力购置的抽水机、发电机等工具，现在已开始被农业社大量买去。仁寿县一些农业社一次集资十万元现金送到县上，要求帮助他们建立十六个水电站和十四个水力站。各地农业社的集体副业也蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来，最近大家都在忙着赶修猪圈、牛圈以及饲料加工场等，到处呈现着一片旺盛景象。
