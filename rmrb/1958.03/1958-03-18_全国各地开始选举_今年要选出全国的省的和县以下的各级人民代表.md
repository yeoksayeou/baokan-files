Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Elections are underway across the country this year.

This year, the terms of the First National People's Congress, the Provincial People's Congresses, and the Second County-Level People's Congresses will expire. Representatives to the Second National People's Congress, the Provincial People's Congresses, and the Third County-Level People's Congresses will be elected. Currently, provinces and cities such as Hebei, Jiangxi, Wuhan, and Shenyang, which started earlier, have fully launched grassroots election work, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has completed its elections.

This year's elections are being conducted on the basis of the significant victories achieved in the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, and the enthusiasm of the voters is high. In some electoral districts, 100% of the voters participated in activities such as discussing candidates and voting. In many townships in Hebei and Shanxi, a "compare thoughts, compare style, compare work" evaluation campaign was also launched when discussing candidates. Because the voters conscientiously selected candidates in the posture of masters of the country, the elected people's representatives are all advanced figures from all strata. Among the people's representatives elected in Yaxi Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants accounted for 72%. According to statistics from eight townships in Henan Province, poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 73% of the total number of people's representatives elected, implementing the rural class line with poor and lower-middle peasants as the dominant force.

In many areas, the spirit of rectification has been earnestly implemented during the elections, and the masses have been mobilized to speak out freely, inspect the work of the government, and criticize some shortcomings of cadres and people's representatives. Voters in Jiangbian Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, put forward a total of 1,300 comments during the election, of which 300 concerned the work of the government and the style of cadres and people's representatives. According to statistics from ten townships in Henan Province, voters expressed more than 31,000 opinions during the elections, involving every township and commune cadre and reaching every corner. Many areas have promptly corrected what could be corrected based on the opinions raised by the masses during the elections.

    全国各地开始选举
    今年要选出全国的省的和县以下的各级人民代表
    据新华社16日讯　全国各地已经开始进行今年的选举工作。
    在今年内，第一届全国人民代表大会、省人民代表大会和第二届县以下各级人民代表大会的任期都将届满，要选出第二届全国人民代表大会代表、省人民代表大会代表和第三届县以下各级人民代表大会代表。目前，进行得较早的河北、江西、武汉、沈阳等省市已经全面展开了基层选举工作，广西僮族自治区已经完成了选举。
    今年的选举是在整风和反右派斗争取得重大胜利的基础上进行的，选民的热情很高。有些选区的选民百分之百地参加了讨论代表候选人和投票等活动。河北、山西两地的许多乡在讨论代表候选人时，还展开了“比思想、比作风、比工作”的评比运动。由于选民们以国家主人翁的姿态认真挑选代表候选人，使选出的人民代表都是各阶层的先进人物。广东省新会县崖西乡选出的人民代表中，工人、贫农和下中农占72％。据河南省八个乡的统计，选出的人民代表中贫农和下中农占人民代表总数的73％，贯彻了以贫农和下中农占优势的农村阶级路线。
    许多地区在选举中，都认真地贯彻了整风精神，发动群众大鸣大放，检查了政府的工作，批评了干部和人民代表的一些缺点。福建省闽侯县江边乡选民在选举中共提出一千三百条意见，其中属于政府工作和干部、人民代表作风问题的有三百条。据河南省十个乡的统计，选民们在选举中鸣放出的意见有三万一千多条，涉及到每个乡社干部，烧到了各个角落。许多地区对群众在选举中提出的意见，能改的都及时改了。
