Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in his congratulatory speech: The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a great victory for the Communist Party's and Chairman Mao's nationalities policy, and people of all nationalities in our country are delighted and encouraged by this. Wang Feng said that after the implementation of regional autonomy, the unity between the Zhuang people and all nationalities within the autonomous region is an important issue. It is hoped that Zhuang cadres and people will take the initiative to unite the people of all fraternal nationalities, earnestly respect the equal rights of other minority nationalities and the Han people, learn from the advanced experiences of the Han people and other nationalities in the spirit of mutual learning, and earnestly help other minority nationalities within the autonomous region who implement regional autonomy to realize their autonomous rights, and guarantee the realization of equal rights in all aspects for minority nationalities living in mixed and scattered communities. Han cadres and people should earnestly respect the autonomous rights of the Zhuang people and other minority nationalities, and regard helping the development of minority nationalities as their glorious historical task, and work diligently with the Zhuang people and other nationalities to struggle for the socialist cause of the autonomous region.

Xie Fumin (Zhuang), Deputy Director of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, said after congratulating the formal establishment of the autonomous region: At present, a socialist education movement to rectify work style and oppose nationalism is being carried out in depth in various places. We hope that people of all nationalities will actively participate in this battle to expose the hideous faces of right-wing elements and local nationalists to the people of the whole country. Through this movement, we will greatly improve the socialist consciousness of the people of all nationalities, distinguish between the capitalist road and the socialist road, clarify the boundary between bourgeois nationalism and socialism, consolidate the great unity of the people of all nationalities in our motherland, and resolutely follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

Wang Zaitian (Mongolian), the representative of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said in his congratulatory message that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region further demonstrates the brilliance of the Party's nationalities policy; at the same time, it is also a powerful response to national separatists with extremely obvious facts.

Sima Yi Yasinuofu (Uyghur), the representative of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, reported in detail the achievements made in various aspects since the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in his congratulatory message. He said that facts have proved that the policy of national regional autonomy is fully in line with the current and long-term common interests of the people of all nationalities in our country.

Liu Xia·Shideng Tabah (Tibetan), the representative of Tibet, said in his congratulatory message that the Tibetan people are working hard to strive for the early establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Therefore, we feel particularly cordial and important to participate in the establishment conference of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It makes us further realize that under the specific conditions of our country, only by implementing national regional autonomy within the unified family of the motherland, and uniting and helping each other with all fraternal nationalities, and taking the socialist road, can the people of all nationalities in our country get rid of poverty and backwardness and seek common prosperity and development. We must actively strengthen the close unity with all fraternal nationalities of the motherland, be vigilant against the attempts of imperialism to provoke, sabotage, and divide the unity of all nationalities in our country, oppose local nationalism and separatist tendencies, and strive to consolidate the unity of the motherland and build the great socialist motherland of the people of all our fraternal nationalities.
