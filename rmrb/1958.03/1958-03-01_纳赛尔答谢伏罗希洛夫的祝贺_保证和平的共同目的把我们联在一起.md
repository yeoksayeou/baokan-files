Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th - TASS reported: Nasser replied to Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, thanking him for his congratulations on the establishment of the United Arab Republic and Nasser's election as president.

The telegram stated: "I am sincerely pleased that I and my colleagues in the two parts of the Republic have been able to realize the generations-long hope of the Arabs for unification and liberation from the control of imperialist forces. The imperialists have tried their best to undermine the foundations of their revival and progress, create disputes among them, and arouse their mutual hatred in order to divide their unity. We pray to Allah to bless us in our cooperation and in activities aimed at improving our social, economic and cultural levels."

Nasser wrote: "I am very happy to take this opportunity to express to you the best feelings of the people of the United Republic towards the people of the Soviet Union, with whom we are linked by cultural and economic ties and the common goal of guaranteeing world peace."

    保证和平的共同目的把我们联在一起
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：纳赛尔复电苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫，答谢他对阿拉伯联合共和国成立和纳赛尔当选总统的祝贺。
    电文说：“我衷心高兴的是，我和共和国两部分的同事们能够实现阿拉伯人联合和摆脱帝国主义势力控制的世世代代的希望。帝国主义者曾经竭力破坏他们复兴和进步的基础，在他们中间制造纠纷，激起他们的相互仇恨，以便分裂他们的统一。我们祈求真主能在合作事业和旨在提高我们社会、经济和文化水平的活动中保佑我们”。
    纳赛尔写道：“我非常高兴借此机会向您表示联合共和国人民对苏联人民所怀有的最美好的情感，我们同苏联人民是由文化和经济的纽带和保证全世界和平的共同目的联结在一起的”。
