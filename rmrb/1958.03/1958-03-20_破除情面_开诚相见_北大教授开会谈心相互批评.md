    Breaking Through Sentimentality, Speaking Openly and Honestly:
    Peking University Professors Hold Heart-to-Heart Talks and Criticize Each Other
    (Our dispatch) The "Double-Anti" movement at Peking University is not only sweeping away waste, conservatism, and the "five airs" in the school but also eliminating "politeness" and "amiability" among professors.
    In the past, criticism and self-criticism were rarely carried out among Peking University professors. This time, the school affairs committee fired the first shot when discussing the launch of the "Double-Anti" movement. At the meeting, Professor Xie Yibing of the Physics Department raised sharp criticisms to some professors in the Chinese and other departments. Some professors criticized President Ma Yinchu's Great Peking University-ism. Ma Yinchu and Yang Huisheng, director of the Chinese Department, made self-criticisms at the meeting.
    Luo Lie, the vice-chairman of the Chinese Department, stayed up all night and wrote twelve big-character posters. Vice President Zhou Peiyuan posted a big-character poster to Professor Fu Ying of the Chemistry Department, asking Fu Ying to examine the bourgeois ideology in a certain article he had published in the *Chemical Bulletin* in the past. Professor Tang Youqi of the Chemistry Department expressed the hope in his big-character poster, "Talking to Old Fu About Our Thoughts," that "Old Fu should also make a determination to make a great leap forward in ideological remolding and be determined to be a completely red and expert, unswerving patriot, and good professor." After reading this big-character poster, Professor Fu Ying wrote "I very much agree!" on it. This is the determination of the professors.
    Professor Feng Youlan of the Philosophy Department posted a big-character poster "Challenging Director Zheng Xin." He hoped that Mr. Zheng would take the lead in eliminating the "dual-track system" (referring to the parallel existence of materialism and idealism) in the department. He expressed that he would first eliminate the "dual-track system" himself and compete with Mr. Zheng. Professor Zheng Xin then posted "Responding to Mr. Feng Youlan's Proposal," stating that he "is willing to burn his own bourgeois ideology in this great revolutionary movement through practice." Professor Xing Qiyi of the Chemistry Department wrote a big-character poster "To Mr. Zhang Pang," mentioning that although they were in the same teaching and research office, they each set up their own stalls in teaching and scientific research, competing with each other, creating a very bad atmosphere. After raising several suggestions to Mr. Zhang in the big-character poster, it said: We all agree that we must be open and honest, cooperate carefully from now on, and resolutely defeat the phenomenon of setting up stalls. The big-character poster "How Textbooks Are Compiled," written by Associate Professor Ji Zhenhuai and others from the Chinese Department, criticized Mr. You Guoen, Wang Li, Wang Yao, Lin Geng, Zhou Zumo, and other teachers for "entrusting this important task to assistants and not writing themselves" when compiling the textbooks commissioned by the Ministry of Higher Education.
    Professor Ji Xianlin of the Department of Eastern Languages wrote in a big-character poster "To Mr. Jin Kemu": "I hope you will stand up, face reality, seize the opportunity, muster your energy, dig into the roots of your own thoughts, dig out those unhealthy things, and transform yourself into a red and expert, energetic, and healthy education and scientific research worker, and serve the people for another thirty years!" Professor Yang Yezhi of the Department of Western Languages posted a big-character poster criticizing Tian Dewang, the director of the German Language Teaching and Research Office, saying that he had turned a blind eye to the work of the Teaching and Research Office and had not taken responsibility.
    Many professors set fire to themselves and criticized their own shortcomings in big-character posters. Professor Lin Changshan of the Biology Department posted a big-character poster examining his own ideas of fame and gain and expressed his intention to thoroughly expose and criticize them. Professor Zhou Yiliang of the History Department criticized his own "valuing the past over the present" ideology in a big-character poster. Professor Gong Xiangrui of the Law Department also posted a big-character poster examining and criticizing his old legal views.
    Professors in many departments also held "heart-to-heart talks" and "confession meetings." Many problems that had not been discussed in the past were brought up, and many prejudices were eliminated. Some professors from the Chinese Department had a heart-to-heart talk at Professor Wei Jiangong's home. Everyone felt that the Chinese Language Teaching and Research Office was just an empty shell and not a real collective. Whether in teaching or scientific research, everyone did their own thing. In the past, everyone was superficially amicable, but in reality, they had opinions of each other but dared not raise them. Professor Zhou Zumo believed that Professor Wei Jiangong had too much temper, and Mr. Wei felt that Mr. Zhou was too polite. Although the two were teacher-student relationship, they did not express their opinions in person. At the heart-to-heart meeting, Mr. Wei said to Mr. Zhou emotionally: "Your politeness makes me stay away from you. It should be said that I am also sorry for you. I fueled others' dissatisfaction with you." Mr. Zhou also expressed that he would improve the relationship in the future.
    Now, there are more and more big-character posters and "confession meetings," and a new, lively spirit is impacting the professors of Peking University.

### 破除情面　开诚相见  北大教授开会谈心相互批评

    破除情面　开诚相见
    北大教授开会谈心相互批评
    本报讯　北京大学的“双反”运动不但在扫除学校中的浪费、保守和“五气”，也在清除教授中的“客气”和“和气”。
    北大教授之间过去很少开展批评与自我批评，这次校务委员会讨论学校开展“双反”运动时开了第一炮。会上物理系谢义炳教授向中文等系的一些教授提出了尖锐的批评；一些教授对马寅初校长的大北大主义提出了批评。马寅初和中文系主任杨晦在会上作了自我批评。
    中文系副主任罗列副教授一夜未睡，写了十二张大字报。副校长周培源给化学系傅鹰教授贴了大字报，要求傅鹰教授检查过去在化学通报上发表的某一篇文章中的资产阶级思想。化学系唐有祺教授在“与傅老谈谈我们的思想”这张大字报中的希望“傅老也下个决心，在思想改造中来个大跃进，立志做又红又专不折不扣的爱国者、好教授。”傅鹰教授看了这张大字报在上面写了“我很赞成！”四个字。这是教授的决心。
    哲学系冯友兰教授贴出“向郑昕主任挑战”的大字报，他希望郑先生在消灭系里的“双轨制”（指唯物、唯心并行）时，首先带头。他表示自己首先要消灭“双轨制”，和郑先生比一比。郑昕教授接着贴出“响应冯友兰先生的倡议”，表示“愿意通过实践在这次伟大的革命运动中烧掉自己的资产阶级思想”。化学系邢其毅教授写了“致张滂先生”的大字报，提到他们虽在同一教研室，可是在教学和科学研究上，各摆各人的摊子，彼此竞争，造成很不良的风气。大字报在向张先生提了几点意见之后说：我们都同意一定要开诚布公，从此精心合作，坚决地要打垮各摆摊子的现象。中文系季镇淮副教授等人写的“教科书是怎样编写的”大字报，批评了游国恩、王力、王瑶、林庚、周祖谟等先生在编写高教部委托的教科书时，“将这个重要任务交给助手完成，自己不动手写”。
    东语系季羡林教授在“致金克木先生”的大字报中写道：“希望你挺身而出，正视现实，抓紧时机，鼓起干劲，挖一下自己思想的根，把那些不健康的东西挖掉，把自己改变成一个又红又专、朝气蓬勃、身体健康的教育和科学研究工作者，再为人民服务三十年！”西语系杨业治教授贴大字报批评德语教研室主任田德望，说他对教研室工作置身度外，没有负起责任。
    许多教授都引火烧身，在大字报上批判自己的缺点。生物系林昌善教授贴大字报检查了自己的名利思想并表示要彻底揭露和批判。历史系周一良教授在大字报中批判了自己“厚古薄今”的思想。法律系龚祥瑞教授也贴大字报检查批判自己的旧法观点。
    不少系的教授还开了“谈心会”，“交心会”。很多过去没有谈出来的问题谈出来了，很多成见消除了。中文系的部分教授在魏建功教授家里谈心，大家觉得汉语教研室只是一个空架子，不是真正的集体。无论教学或科学研究，都自搞一套。过去大家表面上一团和气，实际上互有意见而不敢提。周祖谟教授认为魏建功教授火气太大，魏先生又觉得周先生太客气，两人虽然是师生关系，并不当面提意见。在交心会上魏先生激动地对周先生说：“你的客气使我远离你，应该说，我也对不起你，我助长了别人对你的不满。”周先生也表示今后要把关系搞好。
    现在批评与自我批评的大字报和“交心会”愈来愈多，一种新的生动的朝气冲击着北大的教授们。
