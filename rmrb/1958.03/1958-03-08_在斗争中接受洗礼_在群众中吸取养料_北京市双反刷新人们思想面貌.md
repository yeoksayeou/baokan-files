Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th - Beijing's nationwide anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign is now developing vigorously and profoundly.

In recent days, workers and staff in factories and shops, cadres in government offices, teachers and students in schools, medical circles, various democratic parties, industrial and commercial circles, and residents of neighborhoods in the city have successively plunged into this unprecedented democratic upsurge. Big-character posters are plastered all over the walls in every unit, creating a dazzling array. From March 3rd to 7th, the number of big-character posters put up by the broad masses of workers and staff in forty state-owned factories and mines was more than double the total number of big-character posters since the rectification campaign.

The movement has brought about tremendous changes in the entire social atmosphere, people's relationships, and their mental outlook. Those who used to compare themselves in terms of lifestyle and enjoyment, and who were passive, conservative, and complacent, have all awakened in the heat of the struggle. They are examining their own thinking and are eager to learn from and catch up with the advanced. Many leading cadres have swept away their past bureaucratic airs and lethargy. They have left their desks, stepped out of their offices, and gone to the masses' struggle to be tempered and absorb "nourishment" to guide the struggle. Leading cadres of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have gone deep among the workers, using heart-to-heart talks, "exchanging hearts," examining their own shortcomings, and soliciting workers' opinions. In the intellectual circles, there has also emerged a gratifying phenomenon of breaking down formalities, rejoicing at being corrected, and daring to launch criticism and self-criticism. Every designer in the Beijing Design Institute has posted big-character posters, examining their bourgeois design ideas and launching mutual criticism. The eight chief engineers of the institute have also conducted self-examinations, criticizing their design ideas in the past, which were aimed at establishing "personal monuments" and unilaterally emphasizing the grandeur and beauty of buildings. The political and ideological leap of the broad masses of workers is particularly significant. They not only boldly criticize waste and conservative phenomena and ideas, but also bravely examine and correct their own mistakes. Some of the workers who were relatively backward in the past have also undergone transformation. Through the discussion of "For Whom Do We Labor," the workers of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, who used to make trouble over wages, quotas, and bonuses, now actively request to increase quotas and give up bonuses. They used to compete to do easy and well-paid jobs, but now they scramble for the most tiring and arduous tasks. They used to compare themselves in terms of rank, treatment, and enjoyment, but now they compare themselves in terms of efficiency, quality, economy, drive, and ideological progress. This vigorous and forward-looking touching scene is emerging everywhere in all aspects of the city.

At present, the entire movement is developing unevenly. Units that had not launched anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaigns in the past are now starting to move, one after another, showing a strong momentum of catching up from behind. The masses in most units have been widely mobilized and are now developing in depth, encircling and suppressing conservative ideas, the "three major-isms," and the bureaucratic air, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and delicacy. In some advanced units, the masses are deeply discussing the major and key problems existing in their units. Some units are mobilizing the masses to carry out comprehensive rectification and transformation.

### 在斗争中接受洗礼  在群众中吸取养料  北京市双反刷新人们思想面貌

    在斗争中接受洗礼
    在群众中吸取养料
    北京市双反刷新人们思想面貌
    本报特约新华社7日讯　北京市全民性的反浪费反保守运动，现在正气势磅礴地向深透发展。
    连日来，全市工厂、商店职工、机关干部、学校师生、医务界、各民主党派、工商业界以及街道居民，先后投入这一前所未有的民主高潮。各个单位大字报铺墙盖地，到处琳琅满目。本月3日到7日，四十个国营厂矿企业的广大职工贴出的大字报，比整风以来大字报的总数还多一倍以上。
    运动使整个的社会风气、人们的相互关系和思想面貌发生了极大的变化。过去那些比生活、比享受，消极、保守、自满的人，在火热的斗争中都猛醒过来，纷纷检查自己的思想，急起学先进、赶先进。很多领导干部一扫过去的官风、暮气，离开写字台，跑出办公室，到群众斗争中去接受洗礼，吸取“养料”，指导斗争。国营北京第一棉纺织厂的领导干部深入到工人中去，用谈心的方式，“以心换心”，检讨自己的缺点，征求工人意见。在知识分子中间也出现了破除情面、闻过则喜和勇于展开批评与自我批评的可喜现象。北京市设计院每一个设计人员都贴了大字报，检查自己的资产阶级设计思想，开展相互批评。这个院的八个总工程师也都作了自我检查，批判了各自在以往设计中为树立“个人纪念碑”，片面地强调建筑物伟大、漂亮的设计思想。广大职工群众政治思想上的跃进特别显著，他们不仅大胆地批评浪费、保守的现象和思想，同时也勇敢地检查和改正自己的错误，有些过去比较落后的工人也都有了转变。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂职工们通过“为谁劳动”的讨论，以前闹工资、闹定额、闹奖金的，现在主动地请求提高定额，放弃奖金；从前争着干费劲小、拿钱多的活，现在是抢着要最累、最苦的任务；从前是比级别、比待遇、比享受，现在是比效率、比质量、比节约、比干劲、比思想进步。这种蓬蓬勃勃一往直前的感人情景，在全市各个方面到处在涌现着。
    当前整个运动在不平衡的发展着。过去没有发动反浪费、反保守运动的单位，一个接着一个的动起来了，大有后来居上之势。大部分单位群众已普遍发动起来，正进一步深入发展，围歼保守思想，三大主义和官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气。一些先进单位，群众正深入讨论本单位存在的重大关键性问题；有的单位，正发动群众全力大整大改。
