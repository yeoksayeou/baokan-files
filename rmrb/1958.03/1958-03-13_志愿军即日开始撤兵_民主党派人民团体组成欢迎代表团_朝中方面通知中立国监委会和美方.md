Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th: Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Announces Troop Withdrawal

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army will completely withdraw from Korea in three batches before the end of December 1958. The first batch of six divisions will begin withdrawing from Korea on March 15, 1958, and will be completed before April 30.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Leading figures from China's democratic parties and people's organizations held a joint meeting in Beijing tonight, deciding to organize a Chinese People's Delegation to Welcome the Returning Volunteer Army, and to go to Andong to welcome the returning Volunteer Army troops.

The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

Chairman Guo Moruo first explained the enormous contribution of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country. He said that the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country was a great movement combining patriotism and internationalism. After the Volunteer Army arrived in Korea, they fought alongside the Korean People's Army and quickly drove the invading troops headed by U.S. imperialism back south of the 38th parallel. They not only defended the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also defended our country's security; they not only won a great victory militarily, but also won a great victory morally. This is a great contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

Chairman Guo Moruo said that the Volunteer Army will soon return home, and the people of the whole country sincerely love the Volunteer Army. In order to welcome the Volunteer Army's return, he suggested at the meeting to organize a "Chinese People's Delegation to Welcome the Returning Volunteer Army," and introduced the candidates for the delegation after preliminary consultations.

After listening to Chairman Guo Moruo's explanation, the meeting unanimously decided to organize the Chinese People's Delegation to Welcome the Returning Volunteer Army and approved the list of delegation members. The delegation will soon leave Beijing for Andong.
