    Suspended Bow Pump
    This was created by Zhang Junling and Wen Yisheng, farmers from Xixin Village, Jiaohe County, Hebei Province. It costs only eight yuan to make, and can be operated by a semi-able-bodied person, and can irrigate more than two mu of land a day.
    The structure consists of three bamboo poles bundled into a triangular frame, with a large bamboo bow tied to it, and a cross hanging from the bowstring. The operator sits on a stool, holding the crossbar of the cross, and uses the elasticity of the bow to press up and down, without much effort, and water will gush out from the wooden pipe in the well.

    悬弓式抽水器
    这是河北交河县西辛店乡农民张俊岭、温宜生创造的，造价只花八元，整半劳力都可使用，一天能浇二亩多地。
    结构是在三根竹竿捆成的三角架上，绑上一张竹板大弓，弓弦上吊着十字架。操作的人坐在板凳上，握着十字架横梁，借着弓的弹力一按一起，不用费多大劲，水就从井内木管中涌出来。（附图片）
