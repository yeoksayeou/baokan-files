Contributing Ideas and Efforts to Greatly Improve Tools
Yin Shubai

    (1) At a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" in Paoma Township, Dangyang County, Hubei Province, everyone discussed reforming water conservancy tools and eliminating the method of carrying with shoulders.
    (2) Under the call of "Everyone contributing ideas, everyone taking action," the masses launched a three-contribution movement of contributing ideas, materials, and labor.
    (3) The sound of hammering could be heard everywhere in the village; it was truly "every home is a factory, everyone is a carpenter." In two or three days, the entire township was "vehicle-ized."
    (4) The Dangyang County Party Committee organized cadres from all townships in the county to visit Paoma Township, held on-site meetings, and in five days, the entire county was "vehicle-ized."
    (5) New developments have been made in the work of reforming tools, and various new tools such as boom derricks for transporting earth have emerged.
    (6) The tool reform movement has expanded from reforming water conservancy tools to reforming tools for transportation, production, and other aspects.
    (7) The masses said, "Improving tools is like a key; it opens the lock of the contradiction between production tasks and labor shortages."

    献计献力大改工具
    殷舒白　作
      （1）在湖北省当阳县跑马乡的一个“诸葛亮会议”上，大家讨论了改革水利工具、消灭肩膀挑的办法。
      （2）在“人人献计，个个动手的号召下，群众掀起了献计、献料、献力的三献运动。
      （3）村子里到处听到敲敲打打的声音，真是“家家是工厂、人人是木匠”。两、三天全乡就“车子化”了。
      （4）当阳县委组织了全县各乡干部去跑马乡参观，召开现场会议，五天的工夫，全县“车子化”了。
      （5）改革工具工作又有新发展，出现了吊杆运土等各种多样的新工具。
      （6）工具改革运动从改革水利工具扩大到改革运输、生产等方面的工具。
      （7）群众说：“改良”工具好比是一把钥匙，它打开了生产任务和劳力不足的矛盾这把锁”。
