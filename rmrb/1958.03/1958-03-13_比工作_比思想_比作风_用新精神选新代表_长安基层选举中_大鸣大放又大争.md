Comparing Work, Comparing Thought, Comparing Style
    Selecting New Representatives with a New Spirit
    Mass Expression and Debate in Chang'an's Grassroots Elections
    (From Our Newsdesk) According to news from the *Shaanxi Daily*: Chang'an County, currently engaged in election work, has implemented the spirit of the Rectification Campaign in the elections. It has freely mobilized the masses, encouraged mass expression and debate, resulting in an unprecedented surge in the people's political enthusiasm. Statistics show that the proportion of voters participating in the elections in each township exceeds 95%, which is higher than in 1956 (in 1956, each township was around 94%, with a county average of 94.1%). In many electoral districts, participation reached 100%. For example, in Dongzhao Township, eight of the twenty-nine electoral districts had 100% voter participation.
    The county's election work is currently in its third stage. People's representatives from each township have been elected and are preparing to convene the first session of the Third People's Congress. In the first and second stages of the election activities, all localities, in the spirit of the Rectification Campaign, allowed the masses to fully deliberate and debate on important tasks in the election process, especially the nomination of representative candidates. This raised the political consciousness of the masses, strengthened their sense of ownership, and the elected representatives were well-received by the masses. When Liejia Village Cooperative began deliberating on candidates, most people nominated Cooperative Director Zhang Wenhuan. However, a few people objected, saying that Zhang had sold all the cooperative's surplus grain when selling surplus grain last year, without leaving any "private reserves" for the cooperative, and was "butting outwards like a cow." After debate, everyone agreed that Cooperative Director Zhang Wenhuan had done the right thing and unanimously nominated him as a candidate. When the Unity Fourth Cooperative of Dongzhao Yu Township was deliberating on candidates, the masses initially proposed eight people. Everyone said: "We should elect whoever is most resolute in following the socialist road." To determine their resoluteness, we should first look at their attitude towards the grain issue during last year's summer harvest and whether they have right-leaning conservative thinking in leading production. Therefore, they held eight large and small meetings in a row, meticulously comparing thoughts, comparing work, and comparing styles, and rigorously selecting. The original representative, Han Deli, had falsely registered his three-year-old child as four years old last summer when distributing grain, receiving more grain from the state. Therefore, everyone criticized him for having selfish thoughts and did not elect him. Instead, they selected Han Wanqi as a candidate, who had actively responded to the Party's various calls in water conservancy, sanitation, fertilizer accumulation, grain, and other work, and persuaded cooperative members to complete state tasks.

    比工作　比思想　比作风
    用新精神选新代表
    长安基层选举中　大鸣大放又大争
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：正在进行选举工作的长安县，在选举中贯彻了整风精神，放手发动群众，大鸣大放大争，因而群众政治热情空前高涨。据统计，各乡选民参加选举的比例均在95％以上，较1956年为高（1956年各乡都是94％左右，全县平均为94.1％），不少选区达到百分之百，如东兆乡的二十九个选区中，有八个选区的选民百分之百的参加了选举。
    该县的选举工作目前已进入了第三阶段，各乡的人民代表已经选出，正在准备召开第三届人民代表大会第一次会议。在第一、二阶段的选举活动中，各地都本着整风的精神，对选举过程中的一些重要工作，特别是代表候选人的提名问题，放手让群众进行了充分的酝酿和大争大辩，提高了群众的政治觉悟，增强了主人翁感，选出的代表群众也都满意。猎家村社开始酝酿候选人时，多数人提出了社主任张文焕，但有个别人反对，说张在去年卖余粮时把社里的余粮全卖完了，没给社里留“私包”，是“牛牴角向外顶”。经过辩论后，大家认为社主任张文焕作的对，一致提他为候选人。东兆余乡团结四社酝酿候选人时，开始群众提出了八个人，大家都说：谁走社会主义的道路最坚决就选谁。坚决不坚决，先看他在去年夏收时闹粮问题上的态度怎样；在领导生产上有无右倾保守思想。于是一连开了八次大小会议，细致地比思想、比工作、比作风，严格地进行挑选。原代表韩德利，去年夏季分粮时，曾给自己的三岁小孩多登记了一岁，多领了国家的粮食。因此，大家批评他有自私思想，没有选他，而挑选了在水利、卫生、积肥、粮食等工作中，积极响应党的各项号召，并说服社员完成国家任务的韩万琪为候选人。
