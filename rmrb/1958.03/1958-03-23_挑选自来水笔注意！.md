    Points to Note When Selecting Fountain Pens!
    Whether a fountain pen is easy to use hinges on the quality of the nib. And the main indicator of a good nib lies in whether the iridium tip (that white dot on the tip of the nib) is round, smooth, and whether the writing produces even, fine, and free-flowing lines. Therefore, when you buy a fountain pen, you should first observe whether the two sides of the iridium tip are equal in size. If the difference is significant due to a skewed seam, then during use, the smaller half will easily bend or even break because it bears a different amount of force.
    The best way to check the roundness of the iridium tip is to hold the pen upside down and look down from the top of the nib. This way, it becomes clear whether the iridium tip is round, deformed, delicate, or rough. An iridium tip that is too wide or too flat will produce thick lines and easily tear the paper. Iridium tips with pinholes or sharp edges are even worse and should be avoided at all costs. In addition, when test writing, you shouldn't just write your name or the date. You should write several elongated "one" characters and draw several "1"s, and even write a series of Arabic "8"s. The advantage of this is that the contact area of the nib with the paper is wider, allowing you to check whether each side of the iridium tip is smooth. It also shows whether the ink flow is even, fine, and free-flowing, unlike writing ordinary characters where the ink flow is often limited to the front of the iridium tip. As for the pen barrel, as long as the style is aesthetically pleasing and the workmanship is refined, it is sufficient.

    挑选自来水笔注意！
    一支自来水笔用起来是否得心应手，关键在于笔尖的好坏。而笔尖好坏的主要标志，在于铱头（笔尖头上那颗白的东西）是否圆满、光滑和书写起来笔道是否均匀、细畅。因此，当你买自来水笔的时候，首先应该观察铱头两边是否大小相等。如果因为缝道歪斜致使相差很多，那末，使用起来由于承担的力量不同，小的一半便容易弯曲以致折断。
    检查铱头圆正的最好办法，是将笔倒竖起来，从笔尖的顶头往下看。这样，铱头是圆满还是畸扁？是细致还是粗糙？便可一目了然。过宽过扁的铱头，书写起来笔道既粗又易拉纸；有砂眼和带棱角的铱头为害更大，千万不能要它。此外，在试写的时候，也不能光写自己的姓名或年月日之类，应该多写几个拉长的“一”字和画几个“1”，更要连着写一些阿拉伯“8”字。这样的好处是笔尖的着纸面广了，可检查出铱头的每一面是否光滑，还能看出下水是否均匀、细畅、不像写普通字那样往往局限在铱头的正面了。至于笔杆，只要式样美观和加工细致就可以了。
