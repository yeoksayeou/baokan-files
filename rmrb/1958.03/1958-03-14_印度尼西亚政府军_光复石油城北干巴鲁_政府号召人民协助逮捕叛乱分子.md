Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th - Radio Republic of Indonesia broadcast tonight that government forces recaptured the important oil industrial city of Pekanbaru in Central Sumatra today.

The broadcast said that government airborne troops and infantry regiments recaptured Pekanbaru's airport at 7:00 a.m. today, and then, under the cover of the air force, recaptured the urban area of Pekanbaru at about 1:00 p.m.

Meanwhile, according to Antara News Agency from the newly recovered Bengkalis, the Hossein rebel group's troops in Bengkalis had no fighting spirit. The report said that government forces forced 150 soldiers and police on Bengkalis Island to surrender without firing a shot. When government forces arrived in Bengkalis, Sungai Pakning, and Selat Panjang, local people, officials, soldiers, and police immediately expressed their loyalty to the central government. Thousands of people held rallies in Bengkalis and Selat Panjang to warmly welcome the government forces. Government leaders and members of local councils in both places signed a statement expressing their loyalty to the central government.

The Indonesian Government Information Department broadcast a statement on the radio on the evening of the 11th, calling on the people across the country to assist the government in arresting the rebels of the Hossein group. The Information Department's broadcast statement pointed out that the purpose of the government forces' landing was to arrest Sjafruddin and other rebels and end their treasonous acts.

The broadcast statement pointed out that the rebels plundered the people's property and smuggled it abroad. The statement continued, saying that although Hossein, Simbolon, and other rebels had sent their families to Singapore and were preparing to flee there themselves, they did not allow the people to avoid military targets and go to safe places for refuge. The Information Department especially called on the people of West Sumatra Province to provide more assistance to the government forces, arrest the ringleaders of the rebel group, and prevent them from escaping abroad.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th - Iskandar, a spokesman for the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, told the press on the 12th that his party adheres to the statement it issued a few days ago and will not take a step back, that is, to continue to advocate taking resolute measures to deal with the so-called "revolutionary" government in Central Sumatra.

The spokesman said that any delay may give foreign countries an opportunity to strengthen their assistance to the rebels.

    广播声明指出，叛乱分子掠夺了人民的财产，并且把它们偷运到国外去。声明接着说，虽然侯赛尼、西姆波朗和其他叛乱分子已经把家属送到新加坡，他们自己也准备逃到那里去，但是他们不许人民躲开军事目标到安全地点去避难。情报部特别号召西苏门答腊省人民更多地协助政府军队，逮捕叛乱集团的首恶分子，使他们不可能逃到国外去。
