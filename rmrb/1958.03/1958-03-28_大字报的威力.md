Currently, in central state organs, many striking slogans have appeared, such as: "Many big-character posters in this unit, no smoking." Taking a closer look, there are indeed many big-character posters. From this floor to that floor, the walls on both sides, windows, stairs, and even offices are covered with big-character posters. Several ropes are also strung up in the corridors, with strings of big-character posters connected end to end, resembling the scene of butterflies vying for beauty at Butterfly Spring at the foot of Cang Mountain in Yunnan.

The surge of big-character posters is like a torrential downpour, exposing waste, conservatism, and unhealthy tendencies from all corners under the sunlight.

The upsurge of writing big-character posters is truly like a magnificent torrent, its momentum like a torrential downpour, exposing waste and conservatism in construction, and some unhealthy tendencies among state cadres, nakedly from all corners under the sunlight. This is a great democratic movement that drives the cause of socialist construction and people's thinking forward, and further forward!

Big-character posters are like a thermometer for the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. The more big-character posters a department has, the deeper and more thorough the movement is carried out there. Thousands upon thousands of big-character poster flowers have yielded thousands upon thousands of fruitful results. As soon as big-character posters appeared, democratic life in the organs became exceptionally active, work improved, and people's mental outlook changed greatly. Many problems that could not be solved for a long time were quickly resolved with a barrage of big-character posters. Not long ago, Yang Jingqiu and five others from the Finance Department of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power jointly wrote a big-character poster and sent it to the Industrial Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance, suggesting that self-operated construction units in water and electricity implement a profit-sharing system for enterprises. The director of the Industrial Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance, when contacting the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power for work, expressed his acceptance of the opinions of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and prepared to resolve this issue quickly. However, this suggestion, made by the same people, had been proposed many times in the past, and the Industrial Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance had not considered it for several months. The China National Import and Export Corporation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade imports a large number of lubricating oils from abroad every year, which were previously packaged in heavy iron drums, resulting in significant waste. Someone suggested using light iron drums for oil packaging a long time ago, but the company's leadership had not paid attention to this suggestion. This time, people posted big-character posters and severely criticized the leadership. The company's leadership seriously considered the opinions of the masses and decided to adopt the method of using light iron drums for oil packaging. According to calculations, this year alone, changing to light iron drums for oil imported from one country can save the country 490,000 rubles in foreign exchange. The Fifth Office of the State Council prepared to convene a national working conference and rented a large number of rooms at the Beijing Hotel for the attendees. Someone calculated that if they switched to mid-range hotels, they could save the country 7,000 yuan. So, they made a suggestion to the leadership. However, the leaders believed that the participants were relatively high-ranking cadres, and according to national regulations, it was permissible to stay at the Beijing Hotel, so they were not prepared to change. When oral suggestions were ineffective, the masses wrote a big-character poster and posted it on the director's office door, with the title written in large characters: "Urgent, Urgent, Urgent." The urgent big-character poster finally prompted the leaders to immediately make a decision: to switch to mid-range hotels.

These are three ordinary examples, and such examples are readily available in central state organs. It shows that this new democratic method of big-character posters has tremendous power. It can arouse the power of public opinion, it puts the problem in front of the masses, where everyone can see and point fingers, which is conducive to helping leaders and the masses better integrate.

People describe the power of big-character posters this way: "At first, it only burned coats and hats, then it burned the skin, and now it has burned into the heart, but the more it burns, the more comfortable it feels."

In central state organs, thousands upon thousands of big-character posters burn leaders and ordinary staff members, and even experts, scholars, and engineering technicians who have never paid much attention to politics are undergoing the baptism of big-character posters. People describe the flames of this great revolution this way: "At first, it only burned coats and hats, then it burned the skin, and now it has burned into the heart. But the more it burns, the more comfortable it feels." Why is that? Let's look at the story of Wu Shize, a second-level engineer. This engineer, who had been to the United States, had always regarded himself as an outsider in past movements. Relying on his limited technical knowledge as capital, he was arrogant, conceited, looked down on others, and sought status and fame. The more he thought he was remarkable, the more he looked down on the masses. As a result, he became increasingly detached from the masses, and his relationship with the masses deteriorated day by day, and he gradually became alienated from the Party and the leadership. In those years, whoever offered him suggestions would be immediately countered by him.

After the "Double Anti" movement began, people posted more than a hundred big-character posters about this engineer, offering nearly a hundred suggestions, criticizing him for not giving his heart to the 600 million people. At first, he couldn't understand, and spent all day revolving around the personal gains and losses of "self-esteem." He gave "explanations" to people, attributing everything to "objective reasons," without self-criticism. However, the more he "explained," the more opinions people had. At this time, he secretly asked himself: "Are the comrades' opinions correct? Most of them are facts." "Are they attacking me personally? No. Ah! They are helping me, hoping I will correct myself." In this way, his thinking gradually became enlightened. So, he wrote more than 170 big-character posters in a row, expressing welcome and acceptance of the comrades' opinions, and made many self-exposures, and also offered many opinions to others. He wrote in the big-character poster: "I am a person with relatively serious individualism. In the eight years since liberation, I have done things and looked at problems from the perspective of individualism, without a class stand or mass viewpoint, so I have made numerous mistakes and achieved nothing." "From now on, I must invigorate myself, love my work, and try every means to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, go deep into the grassroots to inspect work, and participate in it. I can no longer stand outside and just make sarcastic remarks. I am determined to make a great leap forward together with the masses." After that, the comrades' attitude towards him changed, and he suddenly felt that the distance between him and the masses and the Party had shortened.

When the reporter visited Wu Shize, he said: "In the past eight years, there have been some criticisms, but only this time am I sincerely convinced. After criticism and self-criticism, I feel quite happy. Of course, reforming my thinking is a long-term process, especially for someone like me."

Another incident occurred in the Second Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building. Zhang Gengmin, a technician at the institute, wrote a big-character poster criticizing engineer Li Guangye, titled "Gray Engineer." This big-character poster listed many things, criticizing Li Guangye for having serious individualism. The big-character poster ended with the following lines of poetry: "Actively strive for your wife, gloomy and individualistic. Emphasize expertise but neglect politics, if you continue like this, your future is over. Hope Mr. Li will be less impatient, lower your head and ask yourself. From now on, thoroughly correct your past mistakes, and dedicate your body and mind to the motherland."

The big-character poster was posted in the office. After seeing it, Li Guangye flew into a rage, insisting that it was "slander against state cadres," declaring that he "would appeal," and even trying to tear down the big-character poster. At this time, all the engineers and technicians in the office stood up to oppose him, stopping his unreasonable behavior.

In fact, Engineer Li Guangye's rude rejection of mass criticism was not accidental. His reputation in the institute had long been poor. Once, when he went to the clinic to take his temperature, he broke a thermometer. According to the rules, he should have compensated for it, but he didn't. His ingenious argument was: at the time, "my throat was itchy, and a sudden cough rose up, which I couldn't suppress... my nerves tensed, and my teeth clamped together and broke it." This was a loss caused by "an uncontrollable and irresistible pathological reason" for which he had "no responsibility to compensate." At that time, someone wrote a big-character poster criticizing Li Guangye, hoping that he would not do things that were inconsistent with his status.

When everyone was applying to go down to participate in labor training, Li Guangye posted a big-character poster titled "My Difficulties." He said something like, "I have just begun to obtain a fortunate environment, and I do not want there to be changes at present." He also said ridiculously that when his child grows up a bit and can take care of himself, he will be younger than he is now, more cheerful than the young comrades, and willing to go to any position.

Li Guangye's various ideological expressions made it impossible for the engineers and technicians to remain silent. They wrote many more big-character posters, calling for "Save Li Guangye!" and urging Li Guangye to "add fuel" to transform himself. One big-character poster issued a warning: "Engineer Li, your individualism is too serious, and you have fallen far behind the times. If you don't thoroughly examine and correct yourself this time, it will only pull you down from the advancing ranks."

The alarm bell of the big-character poster finally woke up Li Guangye. He expressed his acceptance of the comrades' criticisms, and also wrote dozens of big-character posters exposing waste and "five airs."

Big-character posters were born in storms and grew up in storms, and showed their power even more in the Double-Anti movement. Now people are not afraid of big-character posters, but love big-character posters.

However, people did not realize the role of big-character posters from the beginning. Big-character posters were born in storms and grew up in storms. After the rectification campaign began, bourgeois rightists once used big-character posters to launch a rampant attack on the Party and socialism. Later, the people used big-character posters to completely defeat the rightists. Later, the people used big-character posters to set off a high tide of great airing of views and great rectification and transformation, and its role was further demonstrated. In the current Double-Anti movement, big-character posters have shown their power like never before. This process is also a process of people's understanding of the role of big-character posters improving. Now people are not afraid of big-character posters, but love big-character posters. In a research institute with a concentration of senior engineering and technical personnel, the reporter visited Shen Jinyin, a 68-year-old engineer. Originally, he thought: What's so good about big-character posters? How much use can those few big characters be? In this wave of big-character posters, his views changed, and he couldn't help but praise: "Good, big-character posters! Waste should be burned away completely, and bad thoughts and bad work styles should be burned away completely!" So, he went from not wanting to read big-character posters to actively writing big-character posters. Here, senior engineering and technical personnel also unfolded mutual criticism and exposure among their peers for the first time ever. In this way, they truly saw each other for the first time, opinions were eliminated, and they cooperated even better in their work. Many of them used to open their mouths and say "you" this and "you" that, always standing outside the collective. But now, what is often heard is the word "we," such as "our Party," "our socialist cause," "working for ourselves," and so on. This is precisely the manifestation of profound changes in their thoughts and feelings.

Let us sing the praises of our active socialist democratic life! Let us sing the praises of our big-character posters, long live big-character posters!

    大字报的威力
    新华社记者　于民生
    目前在中央国家机关里，出现了许多这样醒目的标语：本机关大字报很多，严禁烟火。走近一看，大字报真的多。从这层楼到那层楼，两边的墙壁上，门窗上，楼梯上，以至办公室里，到处都贴满了大字报。走廊里还拉了几条绳子，那上面一串串大字报首尾相衔，大有云南苍山脚下“蝴蝶泉”群蝶争艳的情景。
    大字报来势如疾风骤雨，把浪费保守、歪风邪气从各个角落赤裸裸地揭露在太阳光下。
    写大字报的热潮真像是波澜壮阔的激流，它的来势如疾风骤雨，把建设中的浪费和保守、把国家干部中的一些歪风邪气，从各个角落赤裸裸地暴露在太阳光下。这是一个伟大的民主运动，它带动着社会主义建设事业，带动着人们的思想向前，再向前！
    大字报犹如反浪费反保守运动的温度表，那个部门的大字报多，那里的运动总是搞得深，搞得透些。千千万万张大字报之花，结出了千千万万颗丰硕的果实。大字报一问世，机关里的民主生活就异常活跃，工作就有起色，人们的精神面貌就大改观。许多长期不能解决的问题，大字报一轰，很快就得到了解决。不久前，水利电力部财务司杨镜秋等六人联名写了一张大字报送给财政部工业财务司，建议水电自营建设单位实行企业利润分成制度。财政部工业财务司司长在到水利电力部联系工作时，表示接受水利电力部的意见，准备很快解决这个问题。然而就是这个建议，同样是这些人，过去曾多次提过建议，事经几月，财政部工业财务司一直没有予以考虑。对外贸易部中国进出口公司，每年要从国外进口大批滑润油，过去都是用重型铁桶装，浪费很大。很早以前就有人建议用轻型铁桶装油，但是公司的领导上一直没有重视这个意见。这次，人们贴出大字报严厉地进行了批评，公司领导上认真地考虑了群众的意见，决定采用轻型铁桶装油的办法。据计算，今年仅从一个国家进口的油料，改用轻型铁桶装以后，就可以为国家节省四十九万卢布的外汇。国务院第五办公室准备召开一个全国性的工作会议，在北京饭店租了大批房间给出席会议的人住。有人计算了一下，如果改住中级旅馆，可以为国家节省七千元。于是便向领导上提出建议。但是领导人认为参加会议的都是比较高级的干部，按照国家的规章制度，住北京饭店是可以的，所以不准备变更。口头建议不见效，群众就写了一张大字报贴到主任办公室的门口，大字报的标题用大字连写三个“火急”。火急的大字报终于督促领导人马上下了决心：决定改住中级旅馆。
    这是三个普通的例子，这样的例子在中央国家机关里俯拾皆是。它说明了，大字报这种新的民主方式，有着巨大的威力，它能够激起舆论的力量，它把问题摆在群众的面前，众目所视，群手所指，这就有利于帮助领导和群众更好地结合起来。
    人们这样形容大字报的威力：“开始只烧到大衣、帽子，进一步烧到皮肤，现在已烧到心里了，但是越烧越感到心里痛快。”
    在中央国家机关里，千千万万张大字报烧到领导干部，也烧到一般工作人员，就连那些一向不大关心政治的专家、学者和工程技术人员，也在经受着大字报的洗礼。人们是这样形容这个大革命烈火的：“开始只烧到大衣、帽子，进一步烧到皮肤，现在已烧到心里了。但是越烧越感到心里痛快。”这是为什么呢？请看一位二级工程师吴世泽的事情吧。这个曾去过美国的工程师，在过去的历次运动中，都以局外人自居。凭着仅有的一点技术知识作资本，他骄傲自大，目空一切，瞧不起人，要地位争名誉。他越觉得自己了不起，就越瞧不起群众。于是他一天一天地脱离群众，同群众的关系一天一天地恶化起来，对党、对领导也慢慢疏远起来。那些年里，谁给他提意见，他就当场给予还击。
    “双反”运动开始以后，人们给这位工程师贴了一百多张大字报，提了近百条意见，批评他没有把心交给六亿人民。起初他想不通，整天在“自尊心”的个人得失圈子里打转。他向人们作“解释”，把一切都推之于“客观原因”，没有自我批评。可是，越“解释”人们的意见越多。这时，他暗地问自己：“同志们提的意见对不对呢？大部分都是事实。”“他们是对我进行人身攻击吗？不是的。啊！他们是在帮助我，希望我改正。”这样，他的思想逐渐开朗了。于是，他连续写了一百七十多张大字报，表示欢迎和接受同志们的意见，并作了许多自我揭发，对别人也提了不少意见。他在大字报上写道：“我是一个个人主义比较严重的人，解放八年来，我做事情，看问题，都是从个人主义出发，没有阶级立场，没有群众观点，所以错误百出，一事无成。”“从今以后，我必须振作精神，热爱我的工作，应当想尽办法去完成上级交下的任务，深入下层检查工作，并参加进去，不能再站在外面，只讲风凉话。决心和群众一起来一个大跃进。”就在这以后，同志们对他的态度改变了，他突然觉得他同群众、同党的距离缩短了。
    当记者访问吴世泽的时候，他说：“过去八年来，也曾有过一些批评，只有这一次才心悦诚服。经过批评和自我批评以后，我感到相当愉快。当然改造思想是长期的，特别是像我这样的人。”
    另一件事情发生在第一机械工业部第二设计院。这个院的技术员张耿民写了一张大字报批评工程师李光邺，题目叫“灰色工程师”。这张大字报列举了许多事情，批评李光邺有严重的个人主义。大字报最后写了这样几句诗：为老婆积极奋斗，暮气重个人主义。轻政治只专不红，再如此前途完蛋。望李公少安勿躁，低下头扪心自问。从此后痛改前非，为祖国贡献身心。
    大字报就贴在办公室里。李光邺看到以后，暴跳如雷，硬说这是“对国家干部的诬蔑”，声言他“要申诉”，并且想把大字报撕掉。这时，全办公室的工程师和技术员都起来反对他，阻止他这种无理的行为。
    其实，李光邺工程师这样粗鲁地拒绝群众批评，不是偶然的，他在这个院的名气早就不大好了。有一次他到医务所看病量体温，把一支体温表打碎了，按照制度他应该赔偿，可是他不，其妙论是：当时“喉头发痒，气促起来一声闷咳，禁也禁不住，……神经一紧张，牙齿一合就砸破了”，这是“属于不可控制与抗拒的一种病态原因”造成的损失，“没有责任赔偿”。在那时有人就写大字报批评过李光邺，希望他不要作出与自己的身份不相称的事情来。
    在大家都申请下放参加劳动锻炼的时候，李光邺却贴出了一张题为“我的困难”的大字报。说什么“刚刚开始获得了一个幸运的环境，我不希望目前有变动”。他还令人可笑地说，等孩子长大一些能照顾自己的时候，我将比现在还年青，比青年同志们更愉快，随便到什么岗位上去我都乐意。
    李光邺的这种种思想表现，使工程师和技术员们怎么也不能沉默。他们又写了许多大字报，呼吁“救救李光邺！”要李光邺“加一把油”改造自己。有一张大字报发出警告：“李工程师，你的个人主义太严重了，你已经远远地落在时代的后面。如果这一次再不好好彻底检查改正，这只会把你从前进的队伍里拉下来的。”
    大字报的警钟终于敲醒了李光邺。他表示接受同志们的批评，并且还写了几十张大字报揭发浪费和“五气”。
    大字报是在暴风雨里诞生，又在暴风雨里成长起来的，在双反运动中更显示了它的威力。现在人们不是害怕大字报，而是热爱大字报了。
    然而，大字报的作用，并不是人们一开始就认识到了的。大字报是在暴风雨里诞生，又在暴风雨里成长起来的。整风开始后，资产阶级右派曾经利用大字报向党和社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻，后来，人民群众利用大字报彻底打垮了右派。再后来，人民群众又利用大字报掀起了大鸣大放和大整大改的高潮，它的作用进一步显示出来。在目前的双反运动中，大字报空前地显示了它的威力。这个过程，也是人们对大字报的作用认识提高的过程。现在人们不是害怕大字报，而是热爱大字报。在一个高级工程技术人员集中的研究所里，记者曾访问了一位六十八岁的老工程师沈觐寅。本来他想：大字报有什么好看？那么几个大字能顶啥用？在这次大字报的浪潮里，他的看法改变了，禁不住赞美起来：“好啊，大字报，应该把浪费统统烧掉，把坏思想坏作风统统烧掉！”于是，他由不想看大字报而积极写大字报了。在这里的高级工程技术人员也都破天荒第一次在自己的同行中展开了互相批评和揭发。这样，他们第一次真心相见了，意见消除了，工作上合作得也更好了。他们当中的许多人，过去张口就是你们长你们短的，自己总是站在集体之外。然而现在，经常听到的却是“我们”两个字，例如“我们的党”，“我们的社会主义事业”，“为我们自己工作”等等。这正是他们思想感情上发生深刻变化的表现。
    让我们歌颂我们活跃的社会主义民主生活！让我们歌颂我们的大字报，大字报万岁！
