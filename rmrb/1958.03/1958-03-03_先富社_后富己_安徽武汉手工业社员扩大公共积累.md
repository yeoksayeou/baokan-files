    Get Rich the Cooperative Way First, Then Get Rich Yourself
    Anhui and Wuhan Handicraft Cooperative Members Expand Public Accumulation
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei - Following the initiative of the Wuhu First Sewing Cooperative in Anhui Province, many handicraft cooperatives (groups) have decided not to distribute, or to distribute only a small portion of, the labor dividends from the 1957 (lunar year) year-end surplus distribution, in order to expand the public accumulation of the cooperatives and support the great leap forward in handicraft production. Currently, 138 handicraft cooperatives (groups) in the cities of Wuhu, Bengbu, Hefei, and Anqing, and handicraft cooperatives (groups) in 11 counties including Zongyang and Taihu in the Anqing Special Zone, have decided not to distribute dividends. According to statistics from 112 handicraft cooperatives (groups) in Wuhu and Hefei, the non-distribution of dividends by members can expand public accumulation by 375,000 yuan.
    This newspaper reports: After the rectification movement, members of the Wuhan Dongfanghong Cotton Weaving Production Cooperative further established the idea of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and loving the cooperative as their own home. They unanimously requested that labor dividends no longer be distributed, starting from 1957. Recently, the cooperative's board of directors, based on the decision of the members' congress, has transferred all of the 12,000 yuan in labor dividends from 1957 to the public accumulation fund.
    Since the establishment of the Dongfanghong Cotton Weaving Cooperative three years ago, the income of the members has increased by more than 60% compared to before joining the cooperative. Recently, the members of this cooperative learned about the fact that the Xiangfan Cotton Weaving Factory set up a nursery for three jiao, and were deeply moved. Many people have expressed their desire to learn from the spirit of advanced factories in running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The 11 members of the youth group in the weaving workshop were the first to propose that labor dividends should not be distributed starting from 1957. More than 180 dazibao (big-character posters) were put up in various workshops within three days, responding to this proposal.
    After the 1957 dividend was transferred to the public accumulation fund, there is now more strength to develop production. Originally, in order to bring the quality of towels up to the level of advanced regions such as Shanghai, the cooperative bought a calendering machine, but could not put it into production because they did not have the money to buy a boiler. Now, they have decided to take out a portion of the public accumulation fund to purchase a boiler, which can be installed in the first half of the year.
    The members have also invested their surplus money into production. Currently, the members have invested more than 1,000 yuan.

    先富社　后富己
    安徽武汉手工业社员扩大公共积累
    据新华社合肥讯　安徽省许多手工业合作社（组），在芜湖市第一缝纫社的倡议之下，决定不分或者少分1957年（旧历年）年终盈余分配中的劳动分红，以扩大合作社的公共积累，支持手工业生产大跃进。现在已有芜湖、蚌埠、合肥、安庆四市的一百三十八个手工业社（组）和安庆专区的枞阳、太湖等十一个县的手工业社（组），决定不分红。据芜湖、合肥两市的一百一十二个手工业社（组）统计，社员不分红可以扩大公共积累三十七万五千元。
    本报讯　武汉市东方红棉织生产合作社的社员经过整风运动，进一步树立了勤俭办社和爱社如家的思想，一致要求从1957年度起不再进行劳动分红。最近，社理事会已经根据社员大会的决定，把1957年度劳动分红金一万二千元全部转为公积金。
    东方红棉织社成立三年以来，社员的收入比入社以前增加了60％以上。最近，这个社的社员了解到襄樊棉织厂用三角钱办起托儿所的事实，深受感动。很多人都表示要学习先进工厂勤俭办企业的精神。织造车间青年组十一个人首先提出了从1957年起不要劳动分红的倡议。各车间三天内就贴出一百八十多张大字报，纷纷响应这个倡议。
    1957年度的分红金转入公共积累以后，发展生产更有力量了。这个社原来为了使毛巾质量赶上上海等先进地区的水平，买了一部烫平机，但是因为没有钱买锅炉，不能投入生产。现在，他们已经决定拿出一部分公积金购买锅炉，上半年就可以安装起来。
    社员们还纷纷把自己多余的钱投入生产。现在社员们已经投资一千多元。
