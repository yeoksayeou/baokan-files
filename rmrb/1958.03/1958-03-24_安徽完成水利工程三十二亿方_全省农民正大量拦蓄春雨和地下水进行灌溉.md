Anhui Completes 3.2 Billion Cubic Meters of Water Conservancy Projects; Farmers Throughout the Province are Actively Storing Spring Rain and Groundwater for Irrigation

(Our Hefei Dispatch) Anhui Province has achieved tremendous success in water conservancy construction this past winter and spring. According to statistics from the province's water conservancy department on the 18th, farmers across the province have completed over 3.2 billion cubic meters of earthwork. Of the province's more than 90 million mu of cultivated land, the irrigation area in 1957 was more than 34 million mu. The more than 2.4 million projects completed this past winter and spring will expand the irrigated area by more than 11 million mu, improve the irrigated area by more than 14 million mu, eliminate waterlogging on more than 15 million mu, and provide soil and water conservation for 2,100 square kilometers. Through the water conservancy projects undertaken this past winter and spring, many areas will be able to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters. For example, ten counties, including Feidong, Chao, Wuhu, Xuancheng, Dangtu, Langxi, Fanchang, Nanling, Hanshan, and Lujiang, will be able to eliminate drought and flood disasters this year. In addition, 310 townships and more than 3,400 cooperatives can also basically eliminate ordinary water and drought disasters this year. Farmers throughout the province are continuing to complete unfinished projects, striving to maximize benefits.

Furthermore, the farmers of Anhui Province are making full use of the completed water conservancy projects to store water on a large scale, serving the great leap forward in agriculture this year. Farmers in the Huainan and Jiangnan areas of Anhui are actively storing spring rain to irrigate farmland. During the heavy rains on the 15th and 16th, the Anqing area organized 530,000 people to engage in water storage and conservation work. More than 80,000 ponds and dams in the entire area have been filled with water, and more than 90,000 ponds and dams are half-full. The stored water can meet the needs of the entire area for soaking rice seedlings. Of the 320,000 water conservancy projects in the Wuhu area, more than 310,000 have stored water, including 140,000 ponds and dams that are full. The amount of water stored in Shucheng County, Lu'an area, can solve the problem of transplanting water for 400,000 mu of rice fields, accounting for 60% of the county. The Huaibei area, which has less rainfall, is also making full use of the groundwater stored in the completed projects for spring irrigation. The entire Huaibei area has irrigated 3.6 million mu of wheat.

    安徽完成水利工程三十二亿方
    全省农民正大量拦蓄春雨和地下水进行灌溉
    本报合肥讯　安徽省去冬今春兴修水利获得巨大成绩。据该省水利部门18日的统计，全省农民已做三十二亿多土方。全省九千多万亩耕地，1957年灌溉面积三千四百多万亩，而去冬今春已完工的二百四十多万处工程，便可扩大灌溉面积一千一百多万亩，改善灌溉面积一千四百多万亩，除涝面积一千五百多万亩，水土保持二千一百多平方公里。通过去冬今春的兴修水利工程，有很多地区将可基本消灭旱涝灾害。如肥东、巢县、芜湖、宣城、当涂、郎溪、繁昌、南陵、含山、庐江等十县今年就可消灭旱涝灾害。另有三百一十个乡和三千四百多个社，在今年也可基本消灭普通水旱灾害。全省农民正在继续完成未完工程，争取尽量扩大效益。
    又讯　安徽省农民正利用已完工的水利工程大量蓄水，为今年农业大跃进服务。在安徽境内淮南和江南地区的农民在积极拦蓄春雨，灌溉农田。安庆专区在15、16两日大雨期间组织了五十三万人投入到蓄水保水工作。全专区已蓄满水的塘坝有八万多处，蓄了半塘坝水的有九万多处，已蓄的水量可以满足全专区泡秧田用水。芜湖专区三十二万处水利工程有三十一万多处已蓄水，其中蓄满水的塘坝就有十四万处。六安专区舒城县已蓄的水量可以解决全县60％的稻田四十万亩插秧用水。降雨量较少的淮北地区，也在充分利用已完工程所蓄的地下水进行春灌，全淮北已浇灌小麦三百六十万亩。
