    Small Spring Harvest
    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 13th dispatch) Yunnan's Chengjiang County has a comprehensive bumper harvest of over 100,000 mu of small spring crops. It is estimated that over 70,000 mu of broad beans will increase production by 100% compared to last year, and wheat, peas, and rapeseed will also achieve bumper harvests. For example, the 2,500+ mu of broad beans in the Old and New Township Agricultural Cooperative have stalks that are taller than a person, with some bean pods reaching over 150 beans each. This cooperative preliminarily estimates a yield of 800 jin per mu, with high-yield fields yielding over 1,000 jin.
    This past winter and spring, Chengjiang County's labor force was very strained. Only about 20% of women and semi-able-bodied laborers were engaged in small spring processing and field management. Many women carried their children to the fields. Before the Spring Festival, after several days of frost, all townships and cooperatives ignited the steam furnaces for applying topdressing fertilizer. Some even used grass covers and smoke to protect the various small spring crops from frost damage, creating a smoky atmosphere everywhere. In addition, last year, over 95% of the county's broad beans were harvested with sickles instead of being pulled by hand, which protected the root nodule bacteria, also a reason for the increased broad bean production.

    Cultivating Large Areas of High-Yield Cotton Fields
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Anhui Province plans to organize 1.1 million mu of large-area high-yield cotton fields, with a yield of over 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu in northern Anhui, and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in the Yangtze River cotton region. Anqing Prefecture plans to strive to become a prefecture with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year.

    Another dispatch: Six counties in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will aim to achieve a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. After three revisions of its plan, the Urumqi Prefecture has proposed striving to become a prefecture with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year.

    小春丰收
    本报昆明13日电：云南澄江县十多万亩小春作物全面丰收，预计七万多亩蚕豆将比去年增产一倍，小麦、豌豆和油菜子也将获得丰收。像旧城乡农业社的二千五百多亩蚕豆，棵秆长到一人多高，有的豆粒达到一百五十多粒，这个社初步估产每亩为八百斤，丰产田将收到千斤以上。
    去冬今春，澄江劳动力十分紧张，只有20％左右的妇女和半劳动力从事小春加工和田间管理，很多妇女背着孩子下地。春节前，下了几天霜，各乡、各社把施追肥的蒸气炉统统燃起，有的还用草盖和烟熏，到处烟雾缭绕，使各种小春作物免受霜灾。加以去年全县有95％以上的蚕豆用镰割不用手拔，保护了根瘤菌，也是蚕豆增产的一个原因。
    培植大面积丰产棉田
    本报讯  安徽省规划组织大面积丰产棉田一百一十万亩，淮北亩产皮棉五十斤以上，沿江棉区亩产皮棉一百斤。安庆专区计划在今年争取实现为亩产百斤皮棉专区。
    又讯  新疆维吾尔自治区有六个县要在今年达到亩产百斤皮棉县。乌鲁木齐专区经过三次修订计划，提出了在今年争取实现亩产百斤皮棉专区。
