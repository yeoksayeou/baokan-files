　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram: Sichuan Province recently held a provincial irrigation management conference, deciding to widely promote advanced irrigation technology throughout the province this year, striving to conserve water and increase the irrigated area by more than 8.9 million mu with existing water conservancy facilities. This year, paddy fields with water conservancy facilities throughout the province will implement rational shallow irrigation, and 80% of paddy fields will implement the new paddy soaking method.

　　Representatives from various regions attending the meeting believed that since last winter and this spring, Sichuan Province has increased paddy fields and irrigated land by more than 16 million mu due to the construction of water conservancy projects. This situation requires that irrigation management work must catch up quickly. The representatives believed that in the past few years, Sichuan Province has made great achievements in strengthening canal management and summarizing advanced irrigation technologies. However, the promotion of advanced technologies is not yet widespread. For example, the new paddy soaking method has been promoted nationwide, but in Sichuan Province, in 1957, the promotion area only accounted for 10% of the total paddy fields (with water conservancy facilities). Coupled with poor technical guidance and research and experimental work remaining on small plots of land, water waste is prevalent in many areas. The meeting conducted serious discussions on issues such as maximizing project benefits, strengthening irrigation management in hilly pond reservoir areas, and improving institutions, facilities, and developing sideline occupations. It was believed that efforts in these areas are needed to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production.

　　Changsha Telegram from our newspaper: Hunan Province plans to universally improve the drought resistance capacity of farmland by five to ten days on the basis of strengthening irrigation management.

　　To date, the province has completed 1,151,553 newly built and repaired projects, which can increase the irrigated area by 2.51 million mu and improve the irrigated area by 16 million mu. Currently, 70% of the projects have stored water, initially playing a role in spring irrigation.

　　Some areas still lack sufficient understanding of the importance of project management. Some cadres and the masses believe that so many water conservancy projects have been built this year, so there is no need to be afraid of drought anymore, thus there is a varying degree of emphasis on repair over management. According to inspections, about 30% of the projects have not promptly stored and conserved water. Some reservoirs have not opened canals after completion, and some projects have not even built spillways. The reservoir water is stored to the full capacity and cannot be sent out. There is still a danger of breaching during mountain floods.

　　Based on the above situation, the water conservancy department of Hunan Province believes that the main task of water conservancy work at present is to conduct a serious inspection and comparison of various projects and strengthen the management of the projects. In order to enable each project to play the greatest role in this year's agricultural production increase, Hunan is launching a "canal repair, leakage plugging, water storage and water conservation" shock month, comprehensively conducting inspection and comparison work. Recently, Hunan Province also held an irrigation management work conference, deciding to improve the drought resistance capacity of farmland by five to ten days throughout the province through irrigation management, ensuring that this year's grain production increase targets can be achieved in the event of a drought like last year.

### 改进灌溉技术　提高抗旱能力  四川决定推广合理浅灌，实行新法泡田  湖南批判重修轻管思想，加强管理工作

    改进灌溉技术　提高抗旱能力
    四川决定推广合理浅灌，实行新法泡田
    湖南批判重修轻管思想，加强管理工作
    据新华社成都电　四川省最近举行全省灌溉管理会议，决定今年在全省广泛推广先进灌溉技术，力求节约用水，使现有水利设施增加灌溉面积八百九十多万亩。今年全省有水利设备的水田都将实行合理浅灌，80％的稻田将实行新法泡田。
    出席会议的各地代表认为：去冬今春以来，四川省由于兴修水利增加了一千六百多万亩水田和水浇地，这种形势要求灌溉管理工作必须迅速赶上。代表们认为，在过去几年中，四川省在加强堰渠管理、总结先进的灌溉技术方面，取得很大成绩，但是先进技术的推广还不普遍。例如新法泡田，已经在全国范围内推广，而四川省1957年推广面积还只占水田（有水利设施的）总数的10％。加上技术指导差，研究试验工作停留在小块土地上，浪费水的情况就在不少地区普遍存在。会议对于发挥工程效益，加强丘陵池塘水库地区灌溉管理，以及健全机构、改善设施、发展副业等问题都做了认真的讨论，认为要从这些方面努力，才能适应农业生产大跃进的形势。
    本报长沙专电　湖南省计划在加强灌溉管理基础上，将全省农田普遍提高抗旱能力五至十天。
    到目前止，全省已完成新建和整修工程达一百一十五万一千五百五十三处，可增加灌溉面积二百五十一万亩，改善灌溉面积一千六百万亩。目前70％的工程已蓄上了水，在春灌中初步发挥了作用。
    有些地区对工程管理的重要性还认识不足，部分干部和群众认为今年修了这么多水利工程，再不怕天旱了，因而存在着不同程度的重修轻管思想。据检查目前还有30％左右的工程没有及时抓紧蓄水保水，有些水库完工后渠道没有开好甚至有的工程还未修溢洪道，库水蓄得满满的送不出去，山洪暴发时还有冲决危险。
    根据以上情况，湖南省水利部门认为：当前水利工作的主要任务，是要对各项工程认真进行一次检查评比，加强工程的管理工作。为了使每个工程在今年农业增产中发挥最大的作用，湖南各地开展一个“修渠整漏蓄水保水”的突击月，全面进行检查评比工作。最近湖南省又召开了灌溉管理工作会议，决定通过灌溉管理，使全省农田提高抗旱能力五至十天，在去年那样旱灾的情况下，保证今年的粮食增产指标能够实现。　　（罗厚仁）
