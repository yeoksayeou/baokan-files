Whether the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is carried out thoroughly is the key to a good Great Leap Forward. Many medical units have already launched the "double anti" movement. However, there are still quite a few hospital leaders who do not have a sufficient understanding of this issue. They have not paid enough attention to carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. Therefore, the masses have not been well mobilized. In some hospitals, there are not many big-character posters exposing waste and conservatism and the "five airs," and there is no vigorous airing of views, but rather a small airing of views. Some hospitals have not even started airing views since the Central Government issued instructions on further developing the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, but have focused their attention on setting targets for the Great Leap Forward, relaxing the "double anti" movement.

Ideological leap forward is the foundation of work leap forward. Without fiercely attacking waste and conservatism, sweeping away the "five airs," and solving the ideological problems of medical personnel, it is impossible to achieve a leap forward.

In terms of health work, it must be said that there are still many problems. The state requires that the people's health cause be run in a faster, better, and more economical way, but many hospitals have not proceeded from the current economic situation of the country, nor from the needs of the 600 million people. The construction cost of hospitals and the standards for equipment are set too high. The rules and regulations of hospitals are generally formulated more from the convenience of medical personnel, so that many patients cannot enter the hospital because of excessive hospital fees. Patients have to queue up to register, see a doctor, and buy medicine, which also causes many difficulties for the masses. In terms of medical quality, because some senior medical personnel overemphasize their own research work, it affects the training of young medical workers, so the improvement of medical ability is also not fast. The existence of these problems is mainly because medical workers are not "red" and expert enough. If the problem is not solved ideologically first, the work of the hospital cannot achieve a great leap forward.

In the past few years, medical workers have received some training and made some progress in various political movements across the country, but they have not yet undergone a relatively deep ideological transformation movement. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to firmly grasp the "double anti" movement, calculate economic and ideological accounts, and further improve the socialist consciousness of medical workers. Only by taking the "double anti" lesson well can we tap potential and truly achieve a great leap forward.

    一定要上这一课
    江浩
    反浪费反保守运动开展得深透与否，是跃进得好不好的关键。许多医疗单位双反运动已经开展。但是，也还有不少医院的领导同志，对这个问题却认识得很不够。他们对于开展反浪费反保守运动尚未充分重视。因此，群众也还没有很好的发动起来。在有些医院里，揭发浪费保守现象和“五气”的大字报还不很多，还没有大鸣大放，而是小鸣小放。甚至有的医院，自中央发布关于进一步开展反浪费反保守运动的指示以来，还没有开始鸣放，只是把注意力集中到搞跃进的指标上去，放松了双反运动。
    思想跃进是工作跃进的基础。不经过猛攻浪费保守，横扫“五气”，解决医务人员的思想问题，要想跃进是跃不起来的。
    在卫生工作方面，应当说，问题还不少。国家要求多快好省地办好人民卫生事业，而有许多医院却没有从国家当前的经济状况出发，没有从六亿人民的需要出发，医院的建筑造价、仪器设备标准都订得过高，医院的规章制度，一般是多从医务人员的便利方面出发来制定的，以致很多病人因为医院收费过多不能进医院的大门；病人挂号、看病和买药都要排队，也给群众造成了很多困难。在医疗质量方面，由于有些高级医务人员过分强调自己的研究工作，影响对青年医务工作者的培养，因此医疗能力提高也不快。这些问题的存在，主要是由于医务工作者还没有红透专深。如果不是首先从思想上解决问题，医院的工作是不可能大跃进的。
    几年来，医务工作者在全国各种政治运动中，受到了一些锻炼，也有一些进步，但是却还没有进行过比较深刻的思想改造运动。因之，目前必须抓紧双反运动，算经济账、思想账，进一步提高医务工作者的社会主义觉悟。只有上好双反这一课，才能把潜力挖掘出来，真正来个大跃进。
