    When I was young, I went to Yunnan and Burma to wander. This was naturally due to the pressure of life, but on the other hand, it was also influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement. I always wanted to get rid of the shackles of feudal society and fly in the sky like a bird. Because of the wandering life and the desire for freedom, once I read Gorky's early short stories, it was like a sweet rain on extremely dry land, and I felt indescribable joy in my heart. I would find and read all of Gorky's works that had been translated into Chinese, and I would read them more than once, always reading them. I would even find and read the works of others that Gorky liked to read. For example, in his "My Literary Education," he said that he greedily read Flaubert's novel "A Simple Heart" to the point where he was "completely absorbed in this novel, and simply became deaf and blind." I once carefully studied this work. I feel that I once became a fervent admirer and follower of Gorky. In 1955, when I returned from Czechoslovakia, I passed through Moscow, and in 1957, I visited the Soviet Union. Both times, I went to the museum affiliated with the Gorky Institute of World Literature to pay homage to his relics, because I had an uncontrollable feeling of admiration.

    Today, on the occasion of the ninetieth anniversary of Gorky's birth, what we hoped for and dreamed of in our youth is being realized one by one in our country, or will be realized soon. The times are very different, but Gorky's works still move my heart and play a huge role in our era. He is the founder of socialist realism, and his literary theories in this regard, as well as works such as "Mother," have always shone brightly, illuminating our way forward. I always feel that Gorky is standing by our side, never leaving us.

    In "Three Sisters," Chekhov, through the mouth of Irina, said: "We don't know how to work, so we are not happy... Those who gave birth to us despise labor." This expresses the true feelings of bitterness of people in the old society, and also illustrates the truth that life should have physical labor. However, in "My Universities," Gorky positively supplemented this truth. He described the joy of dockworkers when they worked, and he also said that he himself "was very willing to work like this for the rest of his life, half crazy, half demented, happily." Because he himself went to the ship to carry bags of rice, running back and forth, he was able to taste the joy of labor. I read this passage praising labor a long time ago, and many years have passed, but it still remains warmly in my heart. Today, in our socialist society, laborers have been transformed from their previous enslaved status to become the masters of the country, and labor is even more sacred. Our literary workers must sing its praises well, which is a very important task. When this task comes to my pen, I can't help but think of Gorky, of his poems praising labor in "My Universities." And I feel even more deeply that to write articles as passionate as his, I must participate in the physical labor of the working people like him.

    Gorky, forever with us, and forever walking ahead of us. (Attached image)

    高尔基永远在我们的前头
    艾芜
    我年青的时候，曾到云南缅甸那些地方去流浪过，这自然由于生活所逼，但另一方面，也因受了五四新文化运动的影响，总想脱去封建社会的束缚，要像鸟儿一样到天空里去飞翔。由于有了流浪的生活，又有渴望自由的心情，一旦读到高尔基的初期的短篇小说，真如干燥极了的土地上一下逢着甘雨，心里有着说不出的喜悦。凡是翻成中文的高尔基作品，都找来读，而且不止读一次，总是常常拿来读。甚至高尔基喜欢读的别人的作品我也要找来读。比如他在“我的文学修养”一文中说到他贪读法国佛罗贝尔的小说“单纯的心”以至“完全被这篇小说吸引住了，简直变成了聋子，变成了瞎子了。”我就曾经把这篇作品仔细研究过。我觉得我自己曾经成了高尔基热烈爱好者和追随者。1955年我从捷克斯洛伐克回来，路过莫斯科，1957年访问苏联，两次都去高尔基世界文学研究所附属的博物馆，瞻仰他的遗物，就是由于有着不能自已的仰慕心情。
    今天适值高尔基诞生九十年的时候，我们年青时候所希望的，所理想的，都在我们的国家里一一实现，或者将要很快地实现。时代是大不相同了，但高尔基的作品，仍然激动我的心，在我们这个时代里，还是起着极大的作用。他是社会主义现实主义的奠基人，关于这方面的文艺理论，以及“母亲”那类的作品，一直光芒四射地照着我们前进。我总觉得高尔基常常站在我们的身边，并没有离开我们。
    契呵夫在“三姊妹”里面，借衣丽娜的嘴说：“我们不知道劳动，因此就不快乐，……生我们的那些人就轻视劳动”。这是道出了旧社会里面人们苦闷的真实心情，也说明了人生应有体力劳动的真理。高尔基却在“我的大学”里面，正面补充了这个真理，他描写出码头工人劳动时候的欢乐，他还说他自己“心里很愿意一辈子就这样半疯半癫，痛痛快快地劳动下去。”因为他自己也到船上去搬米袋，来回地跑，所以能尝劳动的快乐。他这一段歌颂劳动的文章，很早读过，许多年过去了，还很灼热地留在我的心里。今天在我们社会主义社会里，劳动者已从先前的奴役地位，转为国家的主人了，劳动更是神圣的事情，我们文学工作者，更要好好地歌诵它，这是非常重大的任务。这个任务一来在我们笔下的时候，我就情不自禁地想起了高尔基，想起了他在“我的大学”里面歌诵劳动的诗篇。而且更深切地感到要写出他那样热情的文章，也得像他一样参加在劳动人民的体力劳动中去。
    高尔基呵，永远和我们同在，也永远走在我们的前头。（附图片）
