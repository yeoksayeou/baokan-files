Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 7th. Under the pressure of a powerful wave of protests in France and around the world, the French government has been forced at the last minute to reverse its decision to execute Djamila Bouhired, a young Algerian patriotic woman, on the 7th. According to French judicial authorities on the 6th, an agency dealing with commutation issues has accepted Bouhired's case and will review it in the near future.

Bouhired's fate is currently receiving widespread concern from people in France and internationally.

Paris newspapers today reported on the telegram sent by Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, to French President Coty to save Bouhired's life.

It is reported that the Lebanese Prime Minister summoned the French Ambassador to Beirut, asking him to convey to the French government the Lebanese government's desire to pardon Bouhired. This morning, thousands of people held demonstrations in the streets of Beirut to save Bouhired.

In France, the French Women's Union sent a telegram to Coty today, stating that on the eve of celebrating "March 8" International Women's Day, France would be spurned by the world if the death penalty were carried out on the Algerian patriotic young woman Bouhired.

The National Executive Bureau of the French Young Women's Union specially dispatched a delegation to the French Presidential Palace on March 6 to petition for the salvation of Bouhired.

Student and youth organizations, trade unions in various industries, and workers and staff in many enterprises and institutions have all demanded the cancellation of the death sentence against Djamila Bouhired.

At the University of Paris, Communist Party members among the students collected more than 500 signatures on a petition against the execution of Bouhired. The National Standing Committee of the French Communist Student Union called on all members to submit petitions and send delegations to save Bouhired.

Djamila Bouhired's lawyer, Vergès, wrote a letter to the leaders of the International Committee of the Red Cross, saying that the sentence against Djamila Bouhired has aroused great indignation among the broadest social circles in France and other countries.

The Paris newspaper "Libération" today once again appealed: Bouhired must be saved! The newspaper wrote: Bouhired, if you go to the guillotine, France will be infamous!

    世界舆论喝住法国的屠刀
    法国政府被迫停止处死布伊海德
    新华社巴黎7日电　在法国国内和世界公众强大的抗议浪潮的压力下，法国政府已经在最后一刻被迫改变了它原定7日处死阿尔及利亚爱国女青年加米拉·布伊海德的决定。据法国司法当局6日宣布，一个处理减刑问题的机构已经受理布伊海德的案件。它将在最近期内对案件进行审查。
    布伊海德的命运目前正受到法国以及国际上广泛社会人士的关怀。
    巴黎各报今天报道了苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫为拯救布伊海德的生命而打给法国总统戈蒂的电报。
    据报道，黎巴嫩总理召见了法国驻贝鲁特大使，要求他向法国政府转达黎巴嫩政府的愿望，希望赦免布伊海德。今天上午，数千人在贝鲁特大街上为拯救布伊海德举行了示威游行。
    在法国，法兰西妇女联盟今天致电戈蒂说，在庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的前夕，如果对阿尔及利亚爱国女青年布伊海德执行死刑，法国将为世人所唾弃。
    法国女青年联盟全国执行局为拯救布伊海德，在3月6日特别派遣了代表团到法国总统府请愿。
    法国的学生和青年组织、各行业的工会以及许多企业和机关的工人和职员都要求取消对加米拉·布伊海德的死刑判决。
    在巴黎大学，学生中的共产党员征集了五百多人在反对处决布伊海德的呼吁书上签名。法兰西共产主义学生联盟全国常务委员会号召全体盟员提出请愿书和派遣代表团，以拯救布伊海德。
    加米拉·布伊海德的辩护人维尔歇斯写信给红十字国际委员会领导人，信中说，对加米拉·布伊海德的判决引起了法国和其他各国最广泛社会人士的极大愤慨。
    巴黎“解放报”今天再次呼吁：一定要拯救布伊海德。这家报纸写道：布伊海德，如果你上了断头台，法国将声名狼籍！
