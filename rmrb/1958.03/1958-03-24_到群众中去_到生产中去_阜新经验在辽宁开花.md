Going to the Masses, Going to Production
Fuxin Experience Blossoms in Liaoning

(Our Dispatch) "Liaoning Daily" reports: The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions on the 17th, calling on all industrial enterprises in the province to promote the three experiences of Fuxin in changing the style of leadership of enterprises. At the telephone conference on the 18th, the Provincial Committee once again required leading cadres to rectify their work style and learn and promote the Fuxin experience. Now, all industrial enterprises in the province are enthusiastically responding to the Provincial Committee's call, and many leading cadres have moved into workers' residential areas to settle down and start "experimental plots."

After the Yingkou Municipal Committee held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 18th, the district committees, party committees, general branches, and branches convened meetings late into the night to study and discuss action measures, and immediately took action. On the afternoon of the 19th, Comrade Feng Hui, director of the Yingkou Paper Mill, went to the No. 1 machine section of the pulping workshop and cleaned up the messy pulp boards with the workers. They were all very enthusiastic. Liu Mingyu, a feeding worker, happily said, "Today, our section has a new big apprentice, and he's working really hard!" Six leading cadres from the Yingkou Textile Factory had already moved to the workers' residential area on the morning of the 19th. In the afternoon, these six leading cadres went to the workshop to learn from master workers. Leading cadres from local state-owned Fuyuan Machinery Factory, Machinery Repair Factory, Ball Bearing Factory, Knitting Factory No. 1, Glass Products Factory, and Dalong Cotton Weaving Factory started working night shifts on the evening of the 19th. Comrade Niu Boqun, director of the Grain Bureau, moved his luggage to the West Market Grain Station on the 19th to cultivate an "experimental plot"; two managers of the meat wholesale store also went to the pig-raising group of the slaughterhouse to feed pigs.

After discussion, leading cadres of the eighteen engineering companies and affiliated units of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company system immediately shouted the slogan "Learn from Fuxin, Catch up with Shenyang, Completely Change the Style of Leadership," and jointly put forward a guarantee, resolutely move to the workers' residential area within a week, formulate a plan for cultivating "experimental plots" within three days, and challenge Anshan Iron and Steel and other brother factories and mines in the city with this. Leading cadres of Anshan Iron and Steel's factories and mines are even more motivated. They discussed the instructions of the Provincial Committee and the challenge letter from the eighteen units of the Anshan Construction System, and unanimously passed a resolution "We must also revolutionize our leadership style and leadership methods," deciding to move to the workers' residential area within five days, draw up a plan for leading cadres to cultivate "experimental plots" within 24 hours, and implement it immediately. After holding meetings, units such as the Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, Transportation Department, Anshan Electric Power Bureau, Cement Plant, and Farm Tool Factory all held meetings overnight to discuss and formulate plans for leading cadres to cultivate "experimental plots." Party secretaries and factory directors of units such as the Anshan Garment Factory and Railway Equipment Factory moved into the workers' residential area to settle down that night or the next morning.

    本报讯　辽宁日报消息：中共辽宁省委17日发出指示，号召全省各工业企业推广阜新转变企业领导作风的三项经验。18日的电话会议上，省委再一次要求领导干部进行作风的整改，学习、推广阜新经验。现在，全省各工业企业热烈响应省委这一号召，许多领导干部纷纷迁入职工住宅区安家落户，着手搞“试验田”。
    营口市委18日晚召开紧急会议后，各区委、党委、总支、支部连晚召集会议研究讨论，提出行动措施，并立即行动起来。19日下午，营口造纸厂厂长冯辉同志到抄浆车间抄浆一号机工段以后，和工人们一块收拾乱浆板，他们都干的挺起劲。放料工人刘明玉高兴地说：“今天咱们工段新来了一个大徒弟，干的真欢！”营口纺织厂六名领导干部，19日上午已经搬到工人住宅区去了。下午，这六名领导干部就到车间拜师学徒。地方国营富源机械厂、机械修配厂、滚珠轴承厂、针织一厂、玻璃制品厂、大隆棉织厂等工厂的领导干部19日晚上就开始值夜班了。粮食局长牛博群同志19日把行李搬到西市场粮站去搞“试验田”；肉食批发商店两名经理也到屠宰厂饲养组去喂猪。
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司系统的十八个工程公司和附属单位的领导干部一经讨论，立即喊出“学阜新，赶沈阳，彻底转变领导作风”的口号，共同提出一项保证书，坚决在一周内全部搬到职工住宅区，在三天内制订出搞“试验田”规划，并以这个向鞍钢和市内各兄弟厂矿挑战。鞍钢各厂矿领导干部干劲更足，他们讨论了省委的指示和鞍山建筑系统十八个单位的挑战书，一致通过“我们也要在领导作风和领导方法上来个革命”的决议，决定在五天内全部搬到职工住宅区，一昼夜订好搞“试验田”的规划，并立即执行。鞍钢第一炼钢厂，运输部、鞍山电业局，水泥厂、农具厂等单位开过会后，都连夜开会讨论制订领导干部搞“试验田”的规划。鞍山被服厂、铁路器材厂等单位党委书记和厂长，在当天夜里或第二天一早就搬到职工住宅区安家落户。（附图片）
