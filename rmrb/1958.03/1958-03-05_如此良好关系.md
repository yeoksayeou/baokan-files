Notes

    Such a Good Relationship
    According to news from the Paris "International Forum" weekly, West German Economics Minister Erhard recently suggested at a secret meeting of the Bonn government that the Saar should be integrated into West Germany economically in advance. Because, this is of great benefit to West Germany's economy.
    Erhard also knew that if his suggestion were realized, France would suffer a great loss. However, he said with confidence: Don't be afraid that France won't agree.
    Why? There are two reasons: First, France is currently in financial difficulty and needs West German economic "aid"; second, France is particularly "cherishing" its "good relationship" with West Germany because it is worried about the United States and Britain taking "unexpected measures" in North Africa, and therefore would not dare to refuse West Germany's demands.
    To extort others by taking advantage of their difficulties, this relationship is "good" in an extraordinary way. Faced with Erhard's suggestion, the French government, which is obsessed with West German "friendship," should wake up.

    如此良好关系
    据巴黎“国际论坛”周刊的消息，西德经济部长艾哈德不久前在波恩政府的一次秘密会议上建议要把萨尔在经济上提前并入西德。因为，这对西德的经济是大有好处的。
    艾哈德也知道，如果他的建议实现了，法国就会大吃其亏。但是，他却有恃无恐地说：不要害怕法国不答应。
    为什么呢？理由有二：一是法国目前财政困难，需要西德的经济“援助”；一是法国由于担心美英两国在北非做出“出乎意外的措施”，特别“珍视”同西德之间的“良好关系”，因而就不敢拒绝西德的要求。
    乘人之危来进行勒索，这种关系“良好”得实在出奇。面对着艾哈德的建议，醉心于西德“友谊”的法国政府该清醒一下了。
