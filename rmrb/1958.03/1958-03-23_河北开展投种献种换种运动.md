Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 22nd: Hebei Province is mobilizing its members to launch a seed donation and exchange campaign between villages and communes. Currently, approximately 200 million jin of spring wheat, corn, and rice seeds have been collected. Combined with the allocation and supply from the national seed departments, the difficulties Hebei Province faced due to increased planting areas—specifically, the shortage of early-season seeds, improved cotton seeds, and high-yield crop seeds—have been largely resolved. Currently, efforts are being intensified across the province to address the shortage of sweet potato seeds.

In the initial stages of addressing the seed shortage, some cadres and masses in Hebei Province held the idea of solely relying on national allocation. Later, the Party and government leadership departments in these areas criticized this thinking and adopted the method of mobilizing the masses. This not only solved the seed shortage but also enabled some areas to offer surplus seeds to support other regions.

According to preliminary statistics from planting plans across Hebei Province, the province's planting area for sweet potatoes, rice, corn, sorghum, cotton, and spring wheat will increase by more than 50 million mu compared to last year. The total amount of various seeds needed to expand the planting area is estimated to reach approximately 1 billion jin.

### 河北开展投种献种换种运动

    河北开展投种献种换种运动
    新华社保定22日电　河北省各地发动社员开展投种献种和乡社互换种籽运动。目前已经收集春麦、玉米和水稻种籽两亿斤左右，再加上国家种籽部门调拨供应，河北省由于播种面积增加产生的早播种籽、优良棉种和高产作物种籽不足的困难，已经大部解决。目前，各地正在大力解决甘薯种籽不足的困难。
    在解决种籽不足困难的初期，河北省有些地区的干部和群众曾存有单纯依赖着国家调拨的思想。后来这些地区的党政领导部门批判了这种思想，采取了发动群众的办法，不仅解决了种籽不足的困难，有的地区还能拿出多余的种籽支援外地。
    根据河北省各地种植计划的初步统计，全省的甘薯、水稻、玉米、高粱、棉花和春麦等播种面积，较去年增加五千多万亩。扩大种植面积所需要的各种籽种，总计约达十亿斤。
