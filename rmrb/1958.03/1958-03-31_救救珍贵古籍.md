    Save Precious Ancient Books
    Recently, from wastepaper transported from the Chun'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang to a paper mill in She County, Anhui, ancient book dealers picked out a Yuan Dynasty edition of Yan You's "Shao Family Genealogy," a Ming Dynasty Wanli edition of "The West Chamber Fixed Edition," and many other Ming Dynasty edition ancient books. Now, these precious and rare ancient books have been recovered by the state's ancient book acquisition department at a great cost from the ancient book dealers.
    "Shao Family Genealogy" is the work of Shao Guizi, a Jinshi of the Song Xianchun period from Chun'an. This book mainly narrates historical facts of the Southern Song Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty Wanli edition of "The West Chamber Fixed Edition," revised and supplemented by Pan Maishuo, consists of thirty acts and sixteen illustrations, is a unique edition.
    In 1957, from the wastepaper transported from the Chun'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative to a paper mill in She County, a Ming Dynasty Wanli edition of "Chun'an County Chronicle" and various Ming Dynasty edition illustrated opera lyrics were selected. These books also flowed from the paper pulp into the hands of ancient book dealers and were then recovered by the state at a certain cost.
    There are many precious ancient books scattered among the people in our country, but a small number of people still do not know how to protect them, treating these precious ancient books as wastepaper. This is so heartbreaking! The cultural departments of Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, ignore the central government's policies and laws on the protection of cultural relics and ancient books, fail to publicize them to the masses, and fail to promptly inspect the waste products collected from the masses, allowing them to be destroyed. This cannot be tolerated.

    救救珍贵古籍
    最近，从浙江淳安县供销社废品收购站运到安徽歙县一个造纸厂的废书纸中，被古书商贩拣出了元刊本延佑“邵氏世谱”一册，明万历刊本“西厢定本”一册，还有许多种明代版本古书。现在，这些珍贵稀少的古籍已经由国家古籍收购部门花了很大的代价从古书商贩手中收回。
    “邵氏世谱”是宋咸淳进士淳安邵桂子的著作，这本书经过北京图书馆鉴定为元代刊本。这本书所叙述的大都是南宋时代的史实。明万历刊本“西厢定本”，由槃迈硕人增改，三十折，附图十六幅，是一本别开生面的本子。
    1957年从淳安供销社运到歙县一个造纸厂的废书纸中，拣出了明万历刊“淳安县志”和明刊本带图的曲词多种。这些书也是由纸槽流入古书商贩手中，再由国家花一定的代价收回。
    我国散在民间的珍贵古籍是很多的，而少数群众还不知道保护，把这些珍贵古籍当作废纸，这是多么痛心的事！浙江淳安县文化部门忽视中央有关文物古籍保护的政策法令，不向群众宣传，不及时检查从群众中收集来的废品，听其毁损，是不能容忍的。
