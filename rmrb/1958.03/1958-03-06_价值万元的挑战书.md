A Challenge Worth Ten Thousand Yuan

    Railway workers Zhang Qiliang, Yu Yongchang, Wang Tingyi, and twelve other comrades from Andong, Qiqihar, Liuzhou and other places have written to criticize the Zhuzhou Railway Vehicle Depot for sending a challenge letter, over one thousand three hundred words long, via telegram to train repair teams and other relevant units of railway bureaus across the country. According to incomplete statistics from readers, the telegram was sent to more than 300 units. Based on railway telegram charging methods, the Zhuzhou Railway Vehicle Depot would have to pay over 10,000 yuan in telegram fees. This long telegram also affected the normal operations of railway telegraph offices in various locations. The Qiqihar Railway Telegraph Office, in order to receive this telegram, caused several other urgent telegrams to exceed their time limit.
