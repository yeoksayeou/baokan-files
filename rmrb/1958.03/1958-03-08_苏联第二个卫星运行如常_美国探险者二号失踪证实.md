    Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: TASS reports: As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on March 7th, the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite has orbited the Earth 1,780 times.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: Washington dispatch: After more than a day of fruitless searches and verifications, the US Army and Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced with frustration late on the 6th that the US attempt to launch an artificial satellite on the 5th had failed.

    The statement said: "After a comprehensive preliminary review of all available materials related to the launch, and eliminating all other possibilities, it is now certain that the satellite was not sent into orbit because the final stage of the rocket did not ignite."

    The statement pointed out that a four-stage rocket was used this time. The automatic ignition device on the rocket did not ignite the final stage of the rocket, so it did not reach the required acceleration. After flying for a while, the rocket turned its head and plunged towards the ground. Moreover, because it did not have a heat-resistant protection device for re-entry into the atmosphere, it probably burned up upon re-entering the atmosphere about 1,900 miles away. The reason for the failure to ignite the final stage is unknown and will probably be difficult to determine.

    苏联第二个卫星运行如常
    美国探险者二号失踪证实
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社讯：截至7日莫斯科时间六点正为止，苏联第二个人造卫星已经绕地球转了一千七百八十圈。
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：经过了一昼夜以上枉然的多方搜索和核证以后，美国陆军和喷气推进实验所6日很晚的时候懊丧地宣布，美国在5日发射人造卫星的尝试已经失败。
    声明说：“对于发射的一切可能得到的材料都已经进行了全面的初步审查，一切其他可能性都已勾消，现在可以肯定，由于火箭最后一级没有燃烧，卫星没有送上轨道。”
    声明指出，这次用的是四级火箭，火箭上的自动燃点装置没有点燃火箭最后一级，因此没有达到应有的加速度，火箭飞一段后转头向地上栽，而且由于它没有重新进入大气层时抗高温的保护装置，大概在一千九百英里远的地方重新进入大气层时烧毁了。至于没有点燃最后一级的原因则不知道，而且大概将很难查明了。
