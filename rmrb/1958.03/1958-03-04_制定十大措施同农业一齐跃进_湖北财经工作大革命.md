Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd -- The Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting on financial and economic work in Macheng County from February 23rd to 28th. The meeting promoted the experience of Macheng County's financial and trade departments in promoting a great leap forward in agricultural production, formulated ten measures for the province's commercial work to strengthen service to agricultural production, and decided to vigorously reduce commercial and financial institutions in the spirit of opposing conservatism and waste. Supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives will be widely established in agricultural cooperatives.

The main content of these ten measures is as follows: 1. Ensure the supply needs of industrial and agricultural production development in urban and rural areas throughout the province; 2. Implement deep purchasing and long-distance sales, open up commodity sales channels, and find sources of goods for those in need; 3. Establish small processing factories in rural areas, and achieve a processing factory in every township within three to five years; 4. Each agricultural cooperative accepts the entrusted agency purchase and sales business of the state to facilitate members' buying and selling; 5. Actively supply agricultural cooperatives with various means of production, and vigorously improve and promote new agricultural tools and transportation tools; 6. Strive to basically eliminate the use of grain for brewing and making sugar within one to two years; 7. Establish non-staple food supply bases near large and medium-sized cities within three years; 8. Seriously achieve a level of patience that can withstand a hundred selections and a hundred questions, and promptly supply various inexpensive and high-quality commodities; 9. Support the development of the economy in mountainous areas so that they gradually catch up with the plains areas; 10. Comprehensively arrange the promotion of domestic and foreign commodities and try to meet the country's needs for export commodity sources.

The meeting introduced the experience of Macheng County's financial and trade work in leaping forward together with agricultural production. The main experiences of Macheng County's financial and trade work are: The county party committee strengthens the unified leadership of the county's financial and trade departments, cadres vigorously change their work style, and participate in production; they go deep into agricultural cooperatives and the masses to understand the needs of members in production and life, and help solve them in a timely manner. At the same time, the rectification of cadre work style is closely combined with the improvement of the department's business work. In the past year, almost everyone in the county's financial and trade departments has used their spare time to participate in production and go deep into the masses, and many have also planted experimental fields. In production, they have gradually explored ways to better serve agricultural production and improved their business level. After participating in production, the production materials salesmen of the supply and marketing cooperatives are able to explain, use, and repair new agricultural tools and pesticides. When they learned in production that topdressing was needed during the cotton flowering season, they promptly went to other places to organize sources of goods and supplied more than 2 million catties of seabird fertilizer and granular fertilizer, which made the cotton grow strong. Whenever the cadres of the People's Bank discovered that members of a production team were not working, they would take the initiative to visit their homes to find out what happened and help them solve their difficulties, so as not to delay production. While expanding their business, various departments have also worked hard to improve business management, greatly reduce the level of expenses, and increase a lot of profits. According to statistics, last year the county's grain department saved 330,000 yuan in expenses, and the profits turned over to the state by state-owned commercial departments were more than double that of the previous year.

    制定十大措施同农业一齐跃进
    湖北财经工作大革命
    据新华社武汉2日电　中共湖北省委于2月23日到28日在麻城县召开了湖北省财经工作现场会议，推广麻城县财贸部门促进农业生产大跃进的经验，制订了全省商业工作加强为农业生产服务的十大措施，并决定以反保守、反浪费的精神，大力紧缩商业和财政机构，在农业社广泛设立供销部和信用部。
    这十大措施的主要内容是：一，保证供应全省城乡工农业生产发展的需要；二，实行深购远销，打开商品销路，为需要寻找货源；三，农村建立小型加工厂，在三、五年内做到乡乡有加工厂；四，每个农业社接受国家所委托的代购代销业务，便利社员买卖；五，积极供应农业社各种生产资料，大力改良和推广新式农具、运输工具；六，争取在一、二年内基本上不用粮食酿酒、熬糖；七，大中城市附近在三年内建立副食品供应基地；八，认真做到百选不厌、百问不烦，及时供应各项价廉物美的商品；九，扶助山区发展经济，使之逐步赶上平原地区；十，统筹安排国内外商品推销，尽量满足国家对出口商品货源的需要。
    会上介绍了麻城县财贸工作同农业生产一起跃进的经验。麻城县财贸工作的主要经验是：中共县委会加强对全县财贸部门的统一领导，干部大力转变工作作风，参加生产；深入农业社和广大群众中去，了解社员生产和生活上的需要，及时帮助解决。同时把整顿干部作风和改进本部门业务工作紧密地结合起来。近一年来，全县财贸部门几乎人人利用业余时间参加生产、深入群众，很多人还种了试验田，在生产中逐步摸索更好地为农业生产服务的门径，提高了业务水平。供销社生产资料推销员参加生产后，对新式农具、农药械做到了会讲解、会使用、会修理。当他们在生产中了解到棉花盛开季节需要上追肥时，及时到外地去组织货源，供应了二百多万斤海鸟肥和颗粒肥料，使棉花生长茁壮。人民银行干部每发现生产队里有社员没出工，就主动找上门去探清究竟，帮助他们解决困难，以免耽误生产。各部门在扩大业务的同时，还努力改善经营管理，大大降低费用水平，增加了很多利润。据统计，去年全县粮食部门节约费用三十三万元，国营商业部门上缴给国家的利润比前一年多一倍以上。
