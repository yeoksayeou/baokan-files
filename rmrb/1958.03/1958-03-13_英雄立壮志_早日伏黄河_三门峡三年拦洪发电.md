Heroes Aspire to Subdue the Yellow River Early
Sanmenxia to Block Floods and Generate Electricity in Three Years

(Our dispatch) The first session of the First Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party's Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau of the Yellow River recently decided to mobilize the masses to work hard for three years, striving to have the Sanmenxia Water Control Project block floods one year ahead of schedule, generate electricity half a year ahead of schedule, and be completed one year ahead of schedule. Their goals are: to block floods one year ahead of schedule, on July 1, 1960; to generate electricity half a year ahead of schedule, on April 1, 1961; and to be completed one year ahead of schedule, by the end of 1961.

Wang Yingxian, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Second Sub-bureau of Dam Construction and a delegate to the congress, first proposed the initiative to strive for the early flood control and power generation of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project. This initiative received enthusiastic support from the delegates. Everyone cited many examples to prove that it is entirely possible to block floods one year ahead of schedule, generate electricity half a year ahead of schedule, and complete the project one year ahead of schedule. Shi Chuan, a representative of the First Sub-bureau of Dam Construction, said that last year, the quota for each shift of pneumatic drillers was 26 meters, but now the actual production efficiency has reached a maximum of 138 meters. He represented the First Sub-bureau of Dam Construction and stated that on the basis of excavating 330,000 cubic meters of stone last year, this year they will excavate 660,000 cubic meters of stone, doubling last year's leap forward and exceeding this year's task by 160,000 cubic meters. Zhao Wenhua, a representative of the Third Sub-bureau of Dam Construction, said that last December and this January, the average attendance rate of the gravel plant and mixing plant reached 98%, and the attendance rate of the gravel mining team, etc., was as high as 100%. The daily sand mining quota for Liu Zhangyuan's team was 306 cubic meters, and on January 7, they mined 900 cubic meters, exceeding the quota by nearly three times, and later they improved even more. Lu Boxiang's team also surpassed them. Zhao Wenhua stated on behalf of the team: In order to complete the construction task ahead of schedule, there will be as much concrete and gravel as needed.

After the broad masses of workers learned that the conference was discussing early flood control and power generation, their enthusiasm was very high. The conference received more than 80 letters of guarantee and determination from various units. Some units even sent representatives, drumming and gonging, carrying letters of determination and guarantee to complete the task ahead of schedule to the venue to express their determination.

The early flood control and power generation of this magnificent water control project will enable the vast areas threatened by floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River to reduce and avoid flood disasters one year in advance. It will enable the Sanmenxia power system to supply abundant and cheap electricity ahead of schedule, strengthen my country's power industry, and promote the rapid development of industry and agriculture in nearby areas.

    英雄立壮志  早日伏黄河
    三门峡三年拦洪发电
    本报讯　最近举行的中共黄河三门峡工程局首届第一次代表大会决定发动群众，苦战三年，争取黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程提前一年拦洪，提前半年发电，提前一年竣工。他们的奋斗目标是：提前一年，在1960年7月1日拦洪；提前半年，在1961年4月1日发电；提前一年，在1961年年底竣工。
    大会代表、筑坝二分局党委书记王英先首先提出了争取三门峡水利枢纽工程提前拦洪、发电的倡议。这一倡议受到大会代表的热烈拥护。大家举出许多事例证明提前一年拦洪、提前半年发电、提前一年竣工完全可能。筑坝一分局代表石川说，去年风钻工每班台钻进定额是二十六公尺，现在实际生产效率已经最高达到一百三十八公尺。他代表筑坝一分局表示要在去年开挖石方三十三万公方的基础上，今年开挖石方六十六万公方，比去年跃进一倍，超过今年任务十六万公方。筑坝三分局代表赵文华说，去年12月和今年1月份砂石厂、拌和厂的出勤率平均达到98％，砂石厂采砂队等的出勤率还高达100％。刘章元小组每天采砂定额是三百零六方，1月7日他们采砂九百方，超过定额将近三倍，后来又有提高。陆伯祥小组还超过了他们。赵文华代表表示：为了提前完成建设任务，混凝土、砂石要多少有多少。
    广大职工知道大会讨论提前拦洪、发电的消息以后，情绪十分高涨。大会收到各单位职工的保证书、决心书等八十多件；有些单位的职工还派出代表，敲锣打鼓，拿着争取提前完成任务的决心书和保证书到会场表示决心。
    这座宏伟的水利枢纽工程提前拦洪、发电，将使黄河下游受洪水威胁的庞大地区提前一年减免洪水灾害；使三门峡电力系统提前供应充裕的廉价电力，壮大我国电力工业的力量，促进附近地区工农业的迅速发展。　（刘景山）
