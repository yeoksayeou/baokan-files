    My Suggestion:
    City Posters Should Also Be Elegant
    The cleanliness and beauty of a city are certainly closely related to eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and greening efforts. However, whether the posters are elegant also somewhat affects the appearance of the city. At present, in some cities, the posting of notices is extremely poor. Everywhere you can find various announcements, slogans, advertisements, etc., stuck everywhere, making the walls and pillars dirty and unsightly.
    Therefore, I suggest that the municipal construction department, in coordination with relevant units, according to the actual needs of the city, delineate some blank walls in densely populated places, traffic arteries, and eye-catching places (but it is not advisable to select new buildings and buildings with artistic value), and after a little modification, use them exclusively for posting. Doing so will not only facilitate viewing by pedestrians, but also avoid affecting the cleanliness of the city.

    No More Food Allowances Should Be Issued for Staying in Districts and Townships
    As far as I know, some comrades who travel from large cities such as Shanghai and Beijing to counties, districts, and townships to stay on duty receive an 80-cent food allowance every day. I think this system is very unreasonable. Generally speaking, prices in big cities are higher than in districts and townships. Taking the food allowance from the original area for use when on duty is already more than enough, and the state should not give any more subsidies at all.
    For example, those who take overnight trains and do not buy sleeper berths are given a snack allowance of 1.20 yuan. In fact, not sleeping for one night is much more comfortable than rural cadres working continuously day and night to build water conservancy projects, and it should not be subsidized either. I suggest that the state formulate a unified standard for business trip expenses, remove the unreasonable parts of the current regulations, and save every bit of waste for national construction.

    Using Ropes and Tacks to Hang Big-Character Posters Saves in Four Ways
    At present, all agencies have posted a lot of big-character posters, and there are many ways to post them. I think it is worth introducing a method of hanging using ropes and tacks, which is: stringing many ropes in a room and using tacks to pin the big-character posters on the ropes. This saves in four ways: first, it saves flour, saving grain; second, a room can be strung with many ropes, and both sides of the ropes can be used for hanging, saving space; third, ropes and tacks can be reused, saving materials; fourth, posting and replacing are simple, avoiding the trouble of cleaning, saving manpower. This practice should be promoted.

    Absence Should Result in Salary Deduction
    Our agency has posted a lot of big-character posters, and one of the more concentrated opinions is that staff members being late, absent, or taking personal leave are not having their salaries deducted. It is hoped that agencies and organizations should strictly implement the regulations on salary deductions for absenteeism.

专栏：我的建议

    我的建议
    城市的招贴也得讲究
    一座城市的整洁美观固然与除四害、讲卫生和绿化有密切关系；但招贴是否讲究，也多少影响到城市的容貌。目前，在一些城市中，告示的招贴极不讲究。到处都可以发现东一张西一张各色各样的布告、标语、广告等等把墙上柱子上都弄得又脏又难看。
    为此，我建议市政建设部门协同有关单位，按照城市的实际需要，在人烟稠密的场所、交通要口及引人注目的地方，划出一些空白壁（但不宜选定新建筑物和有艺术价值的建筑），稍加修饰后，专供招贴之用。这样做之后，既便于行人的观看，又不致影响市容的整洁。

    区乡住勤不应再发伙食津贴
    据我了解，一些同志从上海、北京等大城市出差到县、区、乡住勤，每天都要领八角钱伙食补贴。我认为，这种制度很不合理。一般说来，大城市的物价都较区、乡为高，把原地区的伙食费拿来出勤时用，已有多余，国家根本不应再给补贴。
    再如，通宵乘车不买卧铺者，发给点心津贴一元二角。其实，一宵不睡比起农村干部兴修水利连干几昼夜要舒服多了，也不应补贴。我建议由国家制定统一的出差费开支标准，去掉现行规定中的不合理部分，把一点一滴的浪费，都节省下来用在国家建设上。

    利用绳子和大头针  张挂大字报有四省
    目前，各个机关都张贴了很多大字报，张贴的办法也很多。我认为，这里值得介绍一下的是一种利用绳子和大头针的张挂办法。就是：在室内绷上许多绳，把大字报用大头针别在绳子上。这样做有四省：一、不用面粉，节省粮食；二、一个房间可绷许多绳子，绳子两面都可以张挂，节省场地；三、绳子、大头针可以继续使用，节省物资；四、张贴、收换简便，避免打扫的麻烦，节省人力。应该推广这种做法。

    缺勤应该扣薪
    我们机关里贴了很多大字报，其中一个比较集中的意见，是机关工作人员迟到、旷职、请事假没有扣薪金，希望机关团体也应该严格执行缺勤扣薪的规定。
