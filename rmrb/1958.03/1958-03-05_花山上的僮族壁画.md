Zhuang Ethnic Group Murals on Flower Mountain
    Yang Ji

    On the Flower Mountain range along the eastern bank of the Ming River, where the Zhuang ethnic group resides, there are ancient Zhuang ethnic group murals. On the precipitous cliffs, stretching over a hundred li, are distributed large murals depicting figures, intermittently. The silver-gray rocks set off the ochre-colored figures, making them appear especially simple and bold.

    These murals, because they are painted in places difficult for people to climb, have been preserved for a long time. To this day, one can still see the actions and objects of the figures in the paintings: riding horses, dancing, boxing, drilling, riding carts, and shooting arrows… as well as bronze gongs, bronze drums, short knives, and swords. On the seven cliffs of Flower Mountain, there are about 30,000 of these human figures, each figure about half a person to a person tall, generally painted on a cliff 290 meters long and 44 meters high, one zhang to several zhang above the surface of the Ming River.

    When and by whom were these paintings made? There are several legends:

    Legend has it that after Huang Chao's uprising failed, his soldiers fled to Guangxi and hid in the caves of these mountains. Later, they were discovered, and the masses borrowed clothing and utensils from them whenever there were weddings or funerals. Initially, they generously lent them out, even giving money and rice to the poor. However, some people only borrowed and never returned, and the utensils in their caves became less and less. Finally, they had to close the cave doors and no longer interact with people. The people, ashamed and angry, reported them to the government soldiers, and Huang Chao and his men were killed in the cave, and the blood that flowed out stained these images.

    Another legend is that a woman once picked up a bamboo tube while gathering firewood near Flower Mountain. Inside the tube was a child. The woman raised the child to adulthood. After the child grew up, he was brave and strong, and very heroic in hunting and fighting, making great contributions to his people. Everyone supported him as king, calling him Bamboo King. Bamboo King went to the Flower Mountain cave to make weapons with bamboo tubes. He was killed by the enemy when only half of the weapons were made. The paintings left on the cliffs now are the other half of the weapons that were not made.

    In the Pearl Mountain cave in the Flower Mountain range, there are also wall poems left behind when Huang Chao fled in defeat. Therefore, it is also possible that these murals were painted by Huang Chao's routed troops. As for these murals, there are records that can be found in the "Ningming Prefecture Chronicle" printed in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The chronicle records: "Flower Mountain is fifty li from the city. There are naturally formed red human figures on the cliffs, all naked, some large, some small, some holding spears, some riding horses. Before the unrest (referring to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising), the colors were bright; after the unrest, the colors were dim." From this record, these murals were very likely painted during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period. However, some people believe that these paintings were made in the Tang Dynasty. From the first year of Emperor Suzong of Tang (756 AD) to the sixth year of Emperor Xianzong (817 AD), Huang Qianyao, the Zhuang ethnic group leader in the Ming River area, once led the Zhuang ethnic group people to resist the ruling class at that time. These murals may also be related to the uprising he led.

    Although the age of the murals is difficult to determine at present, they reflect the life and culture of the Zhuang ethnic group people, are closely related to the history of the Zhuang ethnic group people's national struggle, and are the great artistic creation of the Zhuang ethnic group people.

### 花山上的僮族壁画

    花山上的僮族壁画
    杨集
    在僮族聚居的明江东岸一带的花山山岭上，有着古老的僮族人民的壁画。在那长约一百多里的悬岩绝壁上，断断续续地分布着描绘人物的大幅壁画。银灰色的岩石，衬托着赭色的人物形象，显得格外朴实而粗犷。
    这些壁画，因为画在人们难于攀援到的地方，所以保存较久，至今还能看见那画中人物的动作和器物：骑马的、跳舞的、打拳的、操演的、坐车和射箭的……以及铜锣、铜鼓、短刀和剑等。在花山的七个岩壁上，这种人像，共约三万多个，每一个人像约有半个人到一个人高，一般都是画在长二百九十公尺、高四十四公尺的岩壁上，离明江水面有一丈到数丈高。
    什么时候、什么人在这里画下这些画的呢？传说有几种：
    相传黄巢起义失败后，他的兵逃到广西，躲在这些山上的岩洞里。后来被人发觉，群众凡遇红白喜事都去向他们借用衣物器具。最初他们也都慷慨借出，甚至还以钱米赈济穷人。可是有些人只借不还，他们洞里的什物器具愈来愈少，最后只好把洞门关上，不再同人们往来。人们恼羞成怒，便去报告了官兵，黄巢一干人被杀在洞里，流出来的血就染成了这些画像。
    另一个传说是从前有个女子在花山附近采樵的时候拾到一个竹筒，筒内有个小孩。那女子便将这个小孩抚养成人。孩子长成后，英武有力，行猎打仗都很英勇，为本族人立了很大的功勋，大家拥戴他为王，称为竹王。竹王到花山山洞里用竹筒做兵。兵只做了一半，他就被敌人杀害了。现在留存在岩壁上的画，是那没有做成的另一半兵。
    在花山群岩中的珠山山洞里，还遗留下黄巢败走时的题壁诗，因此说这些壁画是黄巢的溃部所绘也有可能。关于这些壁画，在书中有记载可查的，是清光绪时印行的“宁明州志”。志中记载：“花山距城五十里，峭壁中有生成赤色人形，皆裸体，或大或小，或执干戈，或骑马。未乱（指太平天国起义）之先色明亮，乱过之后色暗淡。”从这个记载来看，这些壁画很可能是在太平天国时绘制的。但也有的人认为这些画是唐朝时代制作的。唐肃宗元年（公元756年）至宪宗六年（公元817年），明江这一带的僮族领袖黄乾耀，曾经领导僮族人民反抗当时的统治阶级，这些壁画也可能和他领导的起义有关。
    壁画制作的年代，目前虽然难于确定，但是毕竟它们反映了僮族人民的生活和文化，同僮族人民民族斗争的历史密切相关，更是僮族人民的伟大艺术创作。
