Why

    The lamp wick is too high, and black smoke appears
    When cooking on a kerosene stove, if you accidentally twist the wick too high, black smoke will emerge from the flame, and a layer of black soot will immediately form on the bottom of the pot. This is because kerosene is a compound of carbon and hydrogen. During combustion, it combines with a sufficient amount of oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide gas and water vapor, releasing heat. When the wick is twisted too high, a large amount of kerosene evaporates from the wick, and there is not enough air entering. Some unburned solid carbon particles escape with the carbon dioxide and water vapor, causing black smoke to come out of the flame. (Ji)

专栏：为什么

    灯芯高了冒黑烟
    在煤油炉上煮东西的时候偶然不小心把灯芯捻得太高了，火焰上就会冒出一缕缕浓黑的烟，锅底上也立刻结成一层乌黑的锅煤。因为煤油是碳和氢的化合物，燃烧时它与足够量的空气中的氧气相化合产生二氧化碳气和水蒸汽，并且放出热。当灯芯捻得太高时，煤油便大量地从灯芯上挥发出来，进入的空气就不够，有些没有点燃的碳的固体微粒便随着二氧化碳和水蒸汽跑出，火焰上就冒出黑烟。　（吉）
