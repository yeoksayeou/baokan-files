    A Young Wife's Mood

    British newspapers have reported that British Defence Minister Sandys is to visit Moscow, and speculated that Sandys' trip is to discuss "the basis for Anglo-Russian talks."

    However, this has reportedly created an "awkward situation" for the British government; a British government spokesman even had to rush to declare: "This visit will be of a courtesy nature and not for any negotiations."

    It would normally be a good thing for a responsible official of the British government to be invited to visit the Soviet Union, but why did the British government try so hard to cover it up after the news came out? Western news agencies say this was to correct the impression the first news created in Washington.

    The British government's display of a young wife's mood is a bit too ridiculous; before the mother-in-law in Washington has even put on her stern face, the young wife on Downing Street has already been frightened into submission.

    小媳妇心情
    英国报纸传出英国国防大臣桑迪斯将要访问莫斯科的消息，并且揣测说桑迪斯之行是讨论“英俄会谈的基础”。
    但是，这样一来，据说却为英国政府造成了“尴尬的局面”；英国政府的发言人甚至不得不赶忙声明：“这次访问将是一种礼节性的，并不是为了进行任何谈判”。
    英国政府的负责官员应邀到苏联去进行访问，这本来是一件正常的好事，可是，为什么英国政府在消息传出去之后要竭力加以掩盖呢？西方通讯社说，这是为了纠正第一个消息在华盛顿所造成的印象。
    英国政府的这种小媳妇心情表现得未免过分令人可笑了；华盛顿的婆婆面孔还没有摆出来，唐宁街的小媳妇就已经给吓软了。
