A Good Tool for Drought-Resistant Sowing: The Water Seeder

    In some areas of Tongwei County, Gansu Province, the soil moisture is very low, making sowing difficult. In order to effectively solve this problem, local leaders have mobilized the masses to study several drought-resistant sowing methods, among which the "water seeder" is better.

    According to test results, using the "water seeder" for sowing only requires 2,000 to 3,000 jin of water per mu to basically achieve the humidity required for seed germination. If the water supply is sufficient, one person and one animal can sow about four mu per day.

    The water seeder is simple to make. It is made by adding a water tank (see Figure 1) and a sprinkler (see Figure 2) to the original wooden seeder. The water tank is for storing water and is made of iron sheet or wood. It stores about 30 jin of water, enough to travel a distance of 900 chi. A switch is installed under the water tank to control the water flow. The sprinkler is also divided into two parts. One is a main water pipe, made of iron sheet (the same below), with a diameter of 1.2 inches and a length determined according to the proportion of the seeder horn. It mainly guides water to the branch pipes to achieve uniform consistency. A funnel is added above the main pipe to draw water into the main pipe. The other is two water branch pipes with a diameter of 0.5 inches. Fix one end of the branch pipe below the main pipe and guide the water to the sprinkler box through the branch pipe (see Figure 1). At the lower end of the sprinkler box, weld a sprinkler iron sheet with small holes, welding it at an angle so that the water is slightly directed backwards, and at the lower rear of the sprinkler box, weld a water-blocking tongue (1 inch long) to prevent water from spilling on the seed hole and blocking the seed hole, affecting sowing. After adding water, open the switch when the livestock moves. If you stop midway, first turn off the water and lift the seeder by hand to avoid soil blocking the seed hole.

    抗旱播种的好工具——水耧
    甘肃通渭县有部分地区，地墒很薄，下种困难。为了有效地解决这一问题，当地领导曾发动群众研究了好几种抗旱播种方法，其中以“水耧”较好。
    根据试验结果，用“水耧”播种，每亩地只需水二、三千斤，就可基本达到种子发芽所需的湿度；如果水能供上，一人一畜每天即能播种四亩左右。
    水耧制作简便。在原来木耧的基础上，再加水箱（见图一）和洒水器（见图二）即成。水箱是供蓄水用的，用铁皮或木板制作，蓄水约三十斤左右，能走九百尺长的一段路程。在水箱下面安一开关，可控制蓄水流量。洒水器也分两部分，一是导水主管一个，用铁皮做成（下同），直径一点二寸，长短要按耧角比例确定，主要是通过主管把水导向支管，以达均匀一致；并在主管上面加一个漏斗，引水流入主管。二是导水支管两个，直径零点五寸，将支管的一端固定在主管的下方，通过支管把水导向洒水盒（见图一）。在洒水盒的下端要各焊一块带有小孔的洒水铁片，焊时成倾斜状，使水稍微射向后方，并在洒水盒的下后方，焊一挡水舌（一寸长），以防水洒在子眼口上，堵塞子眼，影响播种。加水后，等牲畜走动时再开放，如中途停顿，应先把水关住，随手将耧提起，可避免泥土堵塞子眼。
