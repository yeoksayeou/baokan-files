Who Runs the School? For Whom is the School Run?
People's University Party Committee Examines Teaching Ideology

    This newspaper dispatch The People’s University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an expanded Party committee meeting yesterday to begin a self-transformation movement among the school's core Party leaders.
    "Who runs the school and for whom is the school run?" was the central issue of ideological debate at today's meeting. In the spirit of "resolutely clearing away all obstacles to advancing towards being both red and expert," sharp criticism and self-criticism were launched. During their speeches, attendees believed that People's University had achieved great success in cultivating new types of working-class intellectuals, especially young teachers and veteran cadres. Many facts proved that revolutionary work cadres, industrial workers, and children of workers and peasants could both learn well and work well. However, in the past year or two, a tendency to look down on students from worker-peasant and revolutionary cadre backgrounds had grown among some teachers. This was closely related to the school and department leaders emphasizing regularization in the past two years without resolutely implementing the policy of cultivating worker-peasant cadres. Everyone believed that implementing the class line, relying on both red and expert revolutionaries to run the school, and cultivating both red and expert revolutionary cadres should be the school's unwavering guiding principle.
    Speakers at yesterday's meeting pointed out that the major issues that the school must currently solve also include: the implementation of the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical in teaching; the policy of cultivating worker-peasant cadres; political and ideological education work; the principle of combining theory with practice; and improving leadership style. Speakers raised many sharp criticisms and specific suggestions to the school leaders on these issues.
    Due to the core Party leaders taking the lead in self-transformation, the double-anti movement throughout the school has once again been pushed to a new high tide. Many units held heart-to-heart meetings overnight last night.
    Since mid-month, all teachers at People's University have vigorously launched a "conscious, voluntary, and active" self-transformation movement under slogans such as "destroy the old and establish the new in a big way," "destroy while building," and "ignite the fire on oneself consciously; be brave enough to enter the furnace to become steel." This movement is directly aimed at teaching ideology and teaching content, and this self-transformation movement is continuing to develop in depth.

### 由谁办学　为谁办学  人民大学党委检查教学思想

    由谁办学　为谁办学
    人民大学党委检查教学思想
    本报讯  中共中国人民大学委员会昨天举行党委扩大会议，开始在全校党的领导骨干中进行自我改造运动。
    “由谁办学和为谁办学”是今天会议思想交锋的中心。到会者本着“坚决扫清向红透专深迈进的一切障碍物”的精神，展开了尖锐的批评和自我批评。在发言时，大家认为人民大学在培养新型的工人阶级的知识分子，特别是青年教师和老干部方面获得了很大成绩，许多事实证明革命工作干部、产业工人和工农子弟既可以学得好，也可以工作得好。但是在近一二年来却在一部分教师中滋长了轻视工农和革命干部出身的学生的倾向，这和学校以及各系领导人在近两年来强调正规化而不能坚决执行培养工农干部的方针有密切关系。大家认为，贯彻阶级路线依靠又红又专的革命者来办学和培养又红又专的革命干部，应是学校坚定不移的办学方针。
    昨天的会议上发言者指出学校当前必须解决的重大问题还有：关于贯彻教学中的多、快、好、省方针，关于培养工农干部的方针，关于政治思想教育工作，关于理论和实际相结合的方针，关于改善领导作风等。发言者就这些问题向学校领导人提出了很多尖锐的批评和具体建议。
    由于党的领导骨干带头自我改造，已使全校的双反运动再次推向新的高潮。昨晚就有许多单位连夜举行交心会议。
    自本月中旬以来，人民大学全体教师就在“大破大立”“边破边立”，“引火烧身凭自觉，勇于入炉方成钢”等口号下，蓬勃展开了“自觉自愿自动”的自我改造运动。这个矛头直接指向教学思想和教学内容，目前这一自我改造运动正在继续深入开展。
