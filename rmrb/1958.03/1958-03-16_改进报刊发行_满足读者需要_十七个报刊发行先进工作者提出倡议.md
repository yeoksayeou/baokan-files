Xinhua News Agency, March 15th – Seventeen advanced workers in newspaper distribution, at the newspaper distribution work forum convened by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications from March 12th to 14th, proposed a "Six Comparisons" initiative to improve newspaper distribution work.

The main contents of the "Six Comparisons" are: First, compare service attitude. They should be patient, amiable, thoughtful, and not afraid of trouble in answering questions raised by the masses, so that the masses come happily and leave satisfied; break the routine of business hours and implement one shift to the end, etc. Second, compare the number of issues distributed. Take the initiative to contact old subscribers, actively develop new subscribers, and continuously increase the number of newspapers and periodicals. Actively expand retail sales and reduce the rate of storage loss. Retail newspapers and periodicals in urban and rural traffic arteries, scenic spots, and areas where the masses gather and where there are large transient populations; when encountering major festivals, meetings, holidays, and when newspapers and periodicals have important reports, expand retail sales, strengthen mobile services, and do a good job in reserved retail sales. Establish newspaper distribution stations (personnel) in counties, towns, and units with large numbers of people and areas where cadres are sent to lower levels. Third, compare speed of collection, processing, and distribution. Extend the time for collecting newspaper subscriptions as much as possible to better facilitate the masses' subscription to newspapers and periodicals. The time limit for filling out and processing newspaper and periodical orders is shortened from four days and two days to two days and one day respectively; magazines are accepted in batches according to the publication date and the requirements of different publishing houses. It is also possible to subscribe and terminate at any time, without being restricted by the subscription period. Local daily newspapers subscribed to during business hours on the same day will be reported the next day; foreign daily newspapers subscribed to during business hours on the same day will be sent out the next day or on the nearest scheduled shift. After the newspapers arrive at the bureau, they will be delivered to the city center within two hours; magazines arriving in the morning will be delivered at the latest in the afternoon, and those arriving in the afternoon will be delivered at the latest the next morning. In terms of rural mail, the departure time should be connected with the time when newspapers and periodicals enter the bureau. Newspapers and periodicals arriving at the bureau and offices around 6 pm should be delivered to subscribers in this city and town. Fourth, compare quality. Eliminate errors in the number of issues and delivery. Implement door-to-door charging; accept telephone subscriptions. Deliver newspapers and periodicals on time, regardless of wind or rain; on rural mail routes that should be delivered directly to the household, never forward them. In addition, the initiative also proposed comparing saving manpower and material resources, and comparing political conditions.

This initiative was delivered to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on the afternoon of March 13th amidst the sound of gongs and drums. That evening, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications convened a telephone conference attended by leaders and distribution staff from provincial and municipal bureaus across the country. The initiative was read out at the meeting. People from all over the country who participated in the meeting expressed their determination to respond to the initiative.

Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the industry and agriculture are now in a hot and thriving Great Leap Forward, and the broad masses of people need newspapers and periodicals. Our distribution work must catch up and meet the needs of the masses. He encouraged everyone to strive for a greater leap forward under the leadership of the Party, so that the distribution work will show a new look.
