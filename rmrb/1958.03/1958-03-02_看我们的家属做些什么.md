    Look at what our family members are doing
    Qi Shu Yan Railway Factory Union
    Editor's Note: In discussing "Should we retire home to engage in housework?", we also received letters from some readers: They asked: After retiring home, what else can we do besides housework? How can they contribute their strength to the upsurge of socialist construction? Please take a look at the activities of the family members of the Qishuyan Railway workers.
    Worker’s family members are also an important social force in building socialist cause. Under the leadership and assistance of the factory Party committee and the district people's committee, we have mobilized more than 12,000 worker’s family members in our factory and, like all the workers in the factory, invested them in the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production.
    　Supporting Agriculture
    Our factory is in the countryside, so the family members of the workers first formulated a plan to support agriculture: First, accumulate fertilizer; second, provide labor during the busy farming season; and third, mobilize the family members of the workers who have homes in the countryside to return to participate in agricultural labor. Where does the fertilizer come from? Accumulate chimney ash, dig up river mud and gutter sludge, and collect manure; these are all sources. They calculated in detail: If each household cleans the chimney twice a year, 2,800 catties of ash can be accumulated throughout the year; if each household accumulates manure, 13,100 dan can be collected throughout the year. In addition, there would be even more manure from raising 100 pigs. In addition, this year we plan to allocate 1,100 workdays to provide free support to the countryside during the busy farming season. On February 2nd, many family members and workers went to dig 5,000 dan of river mud.
    　　Running Sideline Occupations Well
    Organizing worker’s family members to engage in sideline production can not only increase social wealth and family income, but also change the old habit of family members sitting and waiting for their relatives to bring back wages to support themselves. In 1958, in addition to continuing to engage in sideline occupations such as washing and sewing, the family members will also raise pigs. Where does the feed come from? Collect the discarded vegetable peels, vegetable roots, and rice washing water from daily life, and harvest the weeds inside and outside the factory and in the workshop area in spring and summer, and this is the feed. About one or two thousand dan of weeds can be cut. Vegetable peels and vegetable roots, calculated at four ounces per household per day, can collect 25,769 catties throughout the year; rice washing water can accumulate 251,850 catties throughout the year. This alone is enough for 100 pigs to eat. How to collect rice washing water? We have distributed 69 rice washing vats in the family residential area, and everyone comes to these rice washing vats to wash rice, and the rice washing water is stored.
    　　Improving Worker Attendance Rate
    If the attendance rate of all workers in our factory increases by only 1%, it will increase 14,265 workdays a year, which can create 427,950 yuan of wealth for the country. Therefore, all family members and workers jointly proposed to ensure that the attendance rate of all workers in the factory reaches 98% in 1958 (the average attendance rate of the factory in 1957 was over 96%). The task of the family members is to take good care of the workers' diet, clothing, and ensure that the workers have sufficient sleep and rest, so that they can go to production with full energy. They have established a light inspection system, and at 9:00 p.m., they take turns to check and supervise each household to turn off the lights and go to sleep. In order to prevent endless cultural and entertainment activities at night, anyone who plays mahjong or poker must register in advance, and must stop when it is time to rest. Family members also put small green flags in front of the doors of night shift workers, which is a symbol prohibiting noise.
    Eliminating the Four Pests, Emphasizing Hygiene
    Family members guarantee to eliminate mosquitoes and flies in the workshop area this year, and catch 1,400 rats and 1,400 sparrows; in 1959, the four pests will be completely eliminated. At the same time, they also carry out cleaning and hygiene campaigns in the family and factory areas, and strive to achieve three cleans (clean streets, clean alleys, clean houses), four no’s (no spitting, no pouring water, no littering, no defecating or urinating anywhere) and five withouts (no mosquitoes, no flies, no rats, no sparrows, no cockroaches); and ensure that 99% of households are clean and hygienic households.
    　　"Five Savings and One Deposit"
    "Live a good life, have a good home, and be energetic when working." Experience over the past few years has proven that families who are thrifty and hardworking are "well-fed, well-clothed, and have savings," and will have "harmony in the family, harmony among people, and harmony in everything." This year our specific action slogan is "Five Savings and One Deposit." "Five Savings" means saving food, cloth, water, electricity, and coal, and "One Deposit" means saving money. Since the launch of the "Five Savings and One Deposit" campaign last October, in just over three months, we have saved 20,525 city feet of cotton cloth (because more than 5,600 pieces of old clothes have been turned into new clothes, and large clothes have been changed into small clothes); saved 1,487 catties of rice (because the rice output rate has been increased); saved more than 2,700 tons of tap water; and increased savings by 1,657 yuan. Now 94% of the factories are thrifty and hardworking households, and this year we will further strive to ensure that more than 98% are thrifty and hardworking households.

    看我们的家属做些什么
    戚墅堰铁路工厂工会
    编者按　在讨论“该不该退职回家从事家务劳动？”的时候，我们也收到了一些读者的来信：她们问：退职回家以后，除了家务劳动以外，还能做些什么呢？她们怎样为社会主义建设的高潮献出自己的力量呢？请看看戚墅堰铁路职工家属的活动吧。
    职工家属也是建设社会主义事业中一支重要的社会力量。我们在厂党委和区人委的领导与帮助下，把我厂一万二千多个职工家属发动了起来，和全厂职工一样投入了工农业生产高潮中去。
      支　援　农　业
    我们工厂在农村，所以职工家属们首先订出了支援农业的规划：一是积肥，二是在农忙季节出劳动力，三是动员在农村有家的职工家属回去参加农业劳动。肥料那里来呢？积累烟囱灰，挖掘河泥和阴沟的污泥，积集大小便，这些都是。她们算了一下细账：如果每户每年通两次烟囱，全年就可以积累2800斤灰；如果每户都把大小便积累起来，全年可收集13100担。再加上养一百头猪的粪肥，那就更多了。此外，今年准备抽出1100个劳动日，在农忙季节无偿的支援农村。2月2日那天，已有很多家属和职工一起去挖了河泥5000担。
          搞　好　副　业
    组织职工家属搞副业生产，不仅可以增加社会财富和家庭收入，而且可以改变家属坐等亲人拿工资回来养活自己的老习惯。1958年，家属们除了继续从事洗衣、缝纫等副业外，还要养猪。那里来饲料呢？把日常生活中扔掉的菜皮、菜根和淘米水收集起来，把春夏两季厂里厂外和工房区域内的杂草收割下来，这就是饲料。杂草约可割一、二千担。菜皮菜根，以每户每天收拾四两计算，全年就可收拾25769斤；淘米水，全年可积累251850斤。就这些，就够一百头猪吃的了。淘米水怎样积集呢？我们在家属住宅区里分布设立69个淘米缸，大家都到这些淘米缸来淘米，就把淘米水贮存起来了。
            提高职工出勤率
    我们全厂职工的出勤率，只要提高1％，一年就增加14265个劳动日，可给国家创造427950元的财富。因此，全体家属和职工共同提出在1958年内保证全厂职工出勤率达到98％（1957年全厂平均出勤率为96％以上）。家属们的任务，是照顾好职工的饮食、穿衣、保证职工有足够的睡眠和休息，使他们精力充沛的去生产。她们建立了查灯制度，到晚上九点钟，轮流检查和督促各家熄灯睡觉。为了防止晚上文化娱乐活动的无休无止，凡是玩麻将、扑克的都要事先登记，到了休息时间就要停止。家属们还在夜班工人门前插小绿旗，这是禁止喧哗的标帜。
      除四害、讲卫生
    家属们保证在今年消灭工房区的蚊子和苍蝇，并且捉老鼠1400只，打麻雀1400只；1959年做到彻底消灭四害。她们同时还开展家庭和工厂区域的清洁卫生运动，要做到三清（马路清、弄堂清、屋里清），四不（不随地吐痰，不随地泼水，不随地倒垃圾，不随地大小便）和五无（无蚊子、无苍蝇、无老鼠、无麻雀、无蟑螂）；做到99％的家庭都是清洁卫生户。
              “五节一储”
    “过好日子，安好家，干起活来劲头大。”几年来经验证明，凡是勤俭持家的家庭，就“有吃、有穿、有存款”，并且会“家和，人和，事事和”。今年我们的具体行动口号是“五节一储”。“五节”就是节约粮食、布、水、电、煤，一储就是储蓄。去年10月开展“五节一储”运动以来，仅仅三个多月时间就节约棉布20，525市尺（是因为把5600多件旧衣翻成了新衣、大衣改成了小衣）；节约了1487斤大米（是因为提高了出饭率）节约自来水2700多吨；储蓄金额增加1657元。现在厂里已有94％是勤俭持家户，今年进一步争取达到98％以上是勤俭持家户。
