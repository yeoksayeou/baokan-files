Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 15th: The first peace train carrying the first batch of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea departed from a railway station in Korea this morning, heading for the Yalu River, the border between China and North Korea, full of victory, honor, and friendship.

Before dawn, the station was immersed in a festive atmosphere with the sound of gongs and drums. The Korean people who came to bid farewell were all dressed in festive costumes, singing and dancing from more than ten miles away to the station. Many Korean women even stayed up all night in the rest tents near the station, boiling water for the PVA officers and soldiers boarding the train. When the advance troops of the returning PVA troops gathered at the station, the platform immediately erupted with cheers and loud applause.

The local Korean government and people also held a grand farewell rally for the returning PVA officers and soldiers in the square next to the station.

After the farewell rally, the PVA officers and soldiers danced the Yangge dance and friendship dance with the farewell crowd to the sound of music.

As the train slowly left the station, the Korean people who flocked to both sides of the carriage to see them off waved flower branches, handkerchiefs, hats, and scarves, reluctant to part. Some climbed halfway up the mountainside and rooftops, watching the train move forward.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 15th: The first train carrying the first batch of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea passed through Pyongyang this afternoon on its way home. It was warmly welcomed at Pyongyang Station by Korean party and government leaders, including Korean Vice Premier Kim Il, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jung-ae, and over 60,000 people from Pyongyang.

At 3 p.m., the first train carrying the first batch of PVA troops withdrawing from Korea, led by a locomotive decorated with the national flags of North Korea and China, flowers, and peace doves, entered Pyongyang Station. At this moment, cheers like spring thunder rose from the crowd waiting on the station platform. PVA officers and soldiers stepped off the train amid the welcoming hands of countless enthusiastic people. Korean children and women pinned a large red flower on the chest of each of them. Then, the PVA officers and soldiers were surrounded by soldiers of the People's Army and led to the square in front of the station.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, Major General Xie Fulin, and Major General Wang Mingkun, the leaders of the first batch of PVA troops withdrawing from Korea, walked onto the rostrum of the farewell rally accompanied by party and government leaders such as Kim Il and Park Jung-ae after getting off the train. At this moment, warm applause and cheers resounded throughout the square. Also on the rostrum were: Korean Vice Premiers Nam Il and Lee Joo-yeon, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Kim-cheol, Chairman of the Pyongyang People's Committee Kim Yong-jin, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party Lee Song-un, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang, and others. Korean cabinet ministers, ministers of the central departments of the Workers' Party, heads of democratic parties and social organizations, prominent figures from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys to North Korea also attended the farewell rally.

The rally began with the band playing the national anthems of North Korea and China. Korean Vice Premier Kim Il delivered a farewell speech. On behalf of the people of Pyongyang and the entire Korean people, he conveyed his reluctant feelings to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and, on behalf of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, expressed his heartfelt thanks and greatest respect to the PVA.

Kim Il said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army disregarded difficulties and hardships and displayed the spirit of revolutionary heroism during the war, establishing brilliant feats. They defended every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea with their blood. Their immortal feats will shine as brightly as our country's beautiful rivers and mountains forever.

Kim Il said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army actively assisted Korea's reconstruction after the armistice, undertaking many construction projects, and also helping Korean farmers with farming, rice planting, and harvesting. The internationalist spirit and noble moral qualities shown by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have deeply moved the Korean people and become our example. He said that the warm friendship of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army left in the hearts of the Korean people will permeate our lives and be passed on to future generations.

Kim Il emphasized that as long as the United States forcibly occupies South Korea, the Korean people cannot escape the tragic fate of national division, and the suffering of the South Korean people cannot be eliminated. Therefore, all Korean people unanimously and resolutely demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea. He said that the Korean people will resolutely defend the socialist achievements achieved in the northern part of the Republic and resolutely stand on the eastern frontier, defending peace and socialism. All Korean people will overcome all difficulties and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

After Kim Il's speech, Lee Song-un, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, presented flags and gifts to the PVA on behalf of the working people of Pyongyang. Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun received the flags and gifts. Han Sang-doo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, and Park Yong-guk, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, presented flags to the PVA on behalf of Korean workers and youth, respectively. Kim Kyung-hee, the daughter of Premier Kim Il-sung, presented a silver cup to the PVA generals.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun delivered a reply speech amid warm applause. He said that the Korean people's warm and grand farewell to us will always be remembered in our hearts. He said that we are about to part, and our hearts are filled with reluctance. But, please believe that our hearts will always be with you, and the friendship between our two countries forged with blood will last forever.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun said that we are not only returning home full of the profound friendship of the Korean people, but also full of the valuable lessons of the Korean people. In our long-term common struggle, common labor, and common life, the heroic, hardworking, and persevering spirit of the Korean people will always be a brilliant example for us to learn from. We must bring the fine work style of the Korean people back to our motherland and let it blossom and bear fruit among the Chinese people.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun said that we believe that the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification of the motherland will surely be realized and cannot be stopped by any force.

After the farewell rally, Kim Il, Park Jung-ae, and other Korean party and government leaders held a grand farewell banquet in the newly built station building to entertain PVA generals, officers, and soldier representatives. In the station square, the Korean Central National Art Troupe and the Central Symphony Orchestra and others performed wonderful programs for the PVA officers and soldiers.

The time to leave was approaching. Korean party and government leaders and the farewell crowd reluctantly sent the PVA officers and soldiers into the station. On the station platform, the farewell crowd excitedly lifted the PVA soldiers up, and the female members of the PVA cultural troupe also lifted Vice Chairman Park Jung-ae up. Cheers and slogans shook the earth. Colored paper scraps fluttered. PVA soldiers and the farewell crowd gathered in clusters, embracing, shaking hands, and signing autographs as souvenirs. Many Korean women carefully embroidered sachets and personally tied them to the belts of the PVA soldiers, giving various gifts to the PVA. PVA officers and soldiers boarded the train, and countless colorful paper streamers connected from the hands of the soldiers on the train to the hands of the farewell crowd. At exactly 6 p.m., the train slowly moved forward to the music of "The East is Red." PVA officers and soldiers crowded at every window and door of the train, waving goodbye to the Korean party, government leaders, and the people of Pyongyang. The farewell crowd waved bouquets and flags to see off the PVA.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 15th: On the positions where the first batch of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops handed over defense to the Korean People's Army, the fighting friendship between Chinese and North Korean soldiers was everywhere. Before the PVA left the positions, they stood guard and were on duty side by side with the Korean People's Army, jointly performing various duties. Even before the People's Army takeover troops arrived, the PVA soldiers had already heated the kangs for their comrades and boiled hot water. As soon as the People's Army takeover troops arrived, they handed water to the People's Army comrades to wash their faces and feet. In the evening, they vacated the barracks for the People's Army to live in. However, the People's Army soldiers were very modest and insisted that the PVA soldiers sleep indoors, while they went to the positions to add to the fortifications. On many positions, because the Chinese and North Korean soldiers were competing to take on night duties, they closely performed guard duty and patrols together, guarding the defense, and reluctantly said goodbye the next morning.
