Who Produces the Cheapest Coal?

During the First Five-Year Plan, national state-owned coal mines overfulfilled their production cost plans every year, but there were serious imbalances among the units. From the actual cost figures of January-November 1957, the lowest cost was 7.1 yuan per ton of coal, while the highest, excluding new units such as Hebi and Rongchang, reached 21.222 yuan, a difference of more than two times.

From the perspective of the national coal mines, if the cost of each ton of coal could be reduced by 0.1 yuan or 1%, the nation could save more than 10 million yuan in production costs. The specific conditions of each unit are different, and the production costs will naturally vary somewhat. However, generally speaking, the difference should not be too large. We are now listing the actual costs of each mine from January to November 1957 below, hoping that each unit will analyze and compare them based on its specific circumstances, with the backward striving to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced striving to be even more advanced.

    谁生产的煤最便宜？
    在第一个五年计划期间，全国国营煤矿生产成本每年都超额完成计划，但是各单位存在着严重的不平衡现象。从1957年1—11月实际成本来看，最低的每吨煤七元一角，最高的除鹤壁、荣昌等新单位外，有的竟达二十一元二角二分，相差二倍以上。
    从全国煤矿来看，如果每吨煤的成本能降低一角钱或者降低1％，全国就可节约生产费用一千多万元。各单位的具体条件不同，生产成本的高低自然会有一些出入。但一般说来，相差不应过于悬殊。现在我们把1 957年1—11月各矿实际成本列在下面，希望各单位根据自己的具体情况分析比较，落后的争取赶上先进，先进的争取更先进。
