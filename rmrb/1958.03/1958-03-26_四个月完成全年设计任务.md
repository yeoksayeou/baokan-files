Deeply Enter the Site to Collect Data, Face Reality and Accelerate Design
Complete the Year's Design Tasks in Four Months
Tianjin Design Units Determined to Reverse the Situation Where Design Has Historically Lagged Behind Construction

(Our Newspaper Tianjin, March 25th Dispatch) In the double-anti movement, the designers of the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute and the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau eliminated the "five airs," actively went deep into the site to collect data, and accelerated design, determined to change the situation where design work has historically lagged behind the needs of construction. They guarantee that even with a 25% reduction in design personnel and a nearly 60% increase in this year's design tasks compared to last year, they will complete all of this year's design tasks by the end of April, and save the country approximately 20% in project costs from the design blueprint stage.

This year, the state's basic construction tasks were assigned earlier and are larger than in previous years. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, many construction units are demanding that design departments deliver blueprints in advance. Initially, many designers felt that the manpower was insufficient, the tasks were heavy, and the pressure was great. In the double-anti movement, the raging fire ignited by tens of thousands of big-character posters burned away the designers' past bureaucratic airs of waiting for design materials and only starting when everything was ready, as well as the style of "closing the door to build a car" and being self-righteous without combining with reality. After the designers' thinking was liberated, they recognized the direction of their efforts. As a result, a surge of going deep into the site, actively collecting design data, and accelerating the production of drawings quickly formed. Engineers who were unwilling to go to construction sites even when transported by car in the past are now vying to go to the site, actively seeking out owners, and doing everything possible to collect design data. Sun Yiwen, a designer from the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, took his slide rule and instruments to the Tianjin Boiler Factory after accepting the design task for the expansion of the factory building. He collected data on the one hand and did on-site design on the other. In this way, the 1,200-square-meter expansion task was drafted and finalized within one and a half days, and the project cost was reduced from the original 63,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan.

The designers' ideological style of going deep into the site and facing reality has brought great benefits to construction units. In the past, after construction units applied for design at the design institute, the design institute would routinely issue them an outline for collecting data. This outline was all-encompassing, including even projects such as the wind direction, hydrology, and climate of the construction site, which were not very relevant. However, many construction units did not understand this specialized knowledge, and the data they painstakingly collected was often not suitable for the needs of the designers. A small project often had to be delayed for several months due to waiting for design data. Now, these complicated procedures have been reduced, and the design can be finalized in advance. The design for the expansion of the 8,000-square-meter inpatient building of the Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical College was originally scheduled to be drafted and finalized by the end of June. In order to save time, designer Chen Shuqin designed three drafts and found the responsible persons of the Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau and the Affiliated Hospital overnight to study them together. As a result, the design was finalized within ten days and construction can begin in early April.

When designers go to the site, they also pay attention to studying how to save project costs as much as possible. The First and Second Fur Production Cooperatives were building factory buildings on a piece of land, but both cooperatives wanted to build their own shower stations. After designer Liu Runshen observed the site, he felt that this was too wasteful. He took the initiative to bring the heads of the two cooperatives together to negotiate, and finally decided to reduce one shower station, build 300 square meters less, and save more than 12,000 yuan.

The improvement in design efficiency is even more significant. In the first quarter of this year, the workload of each staff member in the Design Department of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau increased sevenfold compared to the same period last year, and the workload per person in the Tianjin Civil Architectural Design Institute increased 10.7 times compared to last year.

In order to make design work better serve production, the designers of these two design departments are preparing to do the following three things after completing the year's design tasks by the end of April: First, about half of the design staff will go to the construction site to eat, live, and work with the workers. On the one hand, they will participate in labor training, and on the other hand, they will further absorb the opinions of the construction units and construction departments, and modify the errors and unsuitable parts of the design on the spot. Second, for the basic construction tasks for next year that the state can issue in advance, they will complete the design within this year and strive to advance the design year in order to fundamentally reverse the situation where design work lags behind the needs of construction. Third, about 10% of the engineering and technical personnel will go deep into the people to investigate and study, summarize the excellent traditions of folk architecture in our country, as well as good experiences in saving raw materials and reducing project costs.

### 四个月完成全年设计任务

    深入现场搜集资料　面向实际加速设计
    四个月完成全年设计任务
    天津两设计单位决心扭转历年设计赶不上施工的局面
    本报天津25日电　天津民用建筑设计院和天津市建筑工程局的设计师们，在双反运动中打掉“五气”，纷纷深入现场搜集资料，加速设计，决心改变历年来设计工作落后于施工需要的局面。他们保证：在设计人员减少了25％，今年的设计任务又比去年增加近60％的情况下，4月底就完成今年的全部设计任务，并从设计蓝图的关口上为国家节省约20％的工程造价。
    今年国家下达的基本建设任务比往年早，也比往年大。许多施工单位在大跃进的形势下，都要求设计部门能提前交出图纸。开始时，许多设计师感到人力少、任务重，压力很大。在双反运动中，由上万张大字报点燃起来的烈火，烧掉了设计人员过去坐待设计资料、万事具备才动手的官气，以及不结合实际，“闭门造车”、自以为是的作风以后，设计师们的思想获得了解放，认清了努力方向。于是，一个深入现场，主动搜集设计资料，加快出图的热潮就迅速形成了。过去用汽车接送也不愿下工地的工程师，现在都争先下现场，主动找业主，千方百计地搜集设计资料。天津市建筑工程局的设计师孙亦文，在接受了天津锅炉厂扩建厂房的设计任务以后，就带着算尺、仪器到锅炉厂，一方面搜集资料，一方面作现场设计。这样，一千二百平方公尺的扩建任务，在一天半以内就出图定案，并且使工程造价由原来的六万三千元降低到三万元。
    设计师们深入现场、面向实际的思想作风，给建设单位带来了很大的好处。过去建设单位到设计院申请设计以后，设计院照例地发给他们一本搜集资料的提纲。这本提纲包罗万象，连建筑工地的风向、水文、气候等关系不大的项目也应有尽有。但是，很多建设单位不懂得这项专门知识，他们费了很大的劲搜集来的资料，常常不适合设计人员的需要。一项不大的工程因为等待设计资料，往往要拖延几个月之久。现在，这些繁杂的手续减免了，设计就能提前定案。天津医学院附属医院扩建八千平方公尺住院大楼的设计，本来要到6月底才出图定案。设计师陈淑琴为了争取时间，就设计出三种草图，连夜找到天津市公共卫生局和附属医院的负责人共同研究。结果在十天内设计就定案了，4月初就可以动工。
    设计师们到现场去，也注意研究尽量节约工程造价。第一、第二皮毛生产合作社在一块地上兴建厂房，但是两个社都要各建一套淋浴站。设计师刘润身到现场观察以后，认为这样太浪费。他主动地找来两个社的负责人在一起协商，最后确定削减一个淋浴站，少建三百平方公尺的面积，节省一万二千多元。
    设计效率的提高更加显著。天津市建筑工程局设计处今年第一季度每一个工作人员的工作量比去年同期增加了七倍，天津民用建筑设计院每人的工作量比去年增加了十点七倍。
    为了使设计工作更好地为生产服务，这两个设计部门的设计师们准备在4月底完成全年的设计任务以后，作好以下三件事：第一，二分之一左右的设计人员下工地，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动。一面参加劳动锻炼，一面进一步吸取建设单位和施工部门的意见，当场修改设计中的错误和不适用的部分。第二，国家能够提前下达的明年的基本建设任务，他们将在今年内完成设计，并争取设计年度提前，以便根本扭转设计工作落后于施工需要的局面。第三，10％左右的工程技术人员深入民间，调查研究，总结我国民间建筑的优良传统，以及节约原材料、降低工程造价的好经验。
