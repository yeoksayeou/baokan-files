    Simultaneous Development of Water and Land Transportation
    Great Development of Rural Postal and Telecommunications
    Wei Chunshu (Zhuang ethnic group), Director of the Guangxi Transportation Department
    Guangxi's transportation and postal and telecommunications industries were extremely backward before liberation, but have undergone fundamental changes since liberation. In terms of railways, the Laimu section railway, 420 kilometers long, and the Lizhan railway, 314 kilometers long, have been built. Judging from the speed of construction, we are four to five times faster than during the Kuomintang era. The restoration and new construction of the Qian-Gui Line—from Jinchengjiang to Guiyang—is currently underway.
    In terms of highway transportation, after eight years of arduous struggle, the original backward situation has also been greatly changed. In 1957, the province's highway mileage reached 8,800 kilometers, more than three times the highest mileage before liberation.
    In the past eight years, Guangxi's waterway transportation has also made rapid progress. In the short four years from 1954 to 1957 alone, a total of 3,591 kilometers of waterways were dredged. Now the province's navigable mileage has reached 7,794 kilometers. Among them, the mileage of steamship routes reached 2,475 kilometers, more than double the highest year during the Kuomintang rule.
    Guangxi's rural postal and telecommunications network has been established. At the end of 1957, the rural postal routes were more than 79,300 kilometers long, and the county-township telephone lines were more than 89,000 kilometers long, an increase of more than nine times compared with before liberation. Now, basically every district has a post office, and every township has postal service. About 90% of agricultural cooperatives have postal service. In addition, every district has a telephone exchange, and about 98% of townships have telephone service.
    In order to further develop production in minority areas, according to the preliminary plan of the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments: by 1962, the highway mileage should reach 12,000 kilometers. In terms of shipping, after dredging and rectification, by 1967 the province's river mileage for tugboats should increase to 3,000 kilometers. In terms of railways, in addition to carrying out huge technical transformation plans, it is also planned to build more than 500 kilometers of new lines. In terms of postal and telecommunications, complete telephone access in every township within this year. It is conceivable that Guangxi's transportation and postal and telecommunications industries will have a greater leap forward in another three or five years!

    水陆交通齐头进
    乡村邮电大发展
    广西交通厅厅长　韦纯束（僮族）
    广西交通邮电事业在解放前是极为落后的，解放后发生了根本的变化。铁路方面修建了来睦段铁路四百二十公里，黎湛铁路三百一十四公里，从修建的速度来看，我们要比国民党时期快四五倍以上。现在黔桂线——金城江至贵阳段的恢复和新建工程正在进行。
    公路运输方面，经过八年的艰苦奋斗，也大大改变了原来落后的面貌。1957年全省公路通车里程，已达八千八百公里，比解放前最高通车里程多两倍以上。
    八年来，广西水路运输也在突飞猛进。仅在1954年至1957年短短的四年时间里，共疏浚三千五百九十一公里长的河道，现在全省通航里程已达七千七百九十四公里。其中通轮航线达二千四百七十五公里，超过国民党统治时期最高年份的一倍以上。
    广西乡村邮电网建设起来了。1957年底，乡村邮路已有七万九千三百多公里，县乡电话线路长达八万九千多公里，比解放前增加了九倍以上。现在基本上区区有邮政所，乡乡通邮政了，通邮政的农业社已达到90％左右。另外，区区都设有电话总机，通话的乡也已达到98％左右。
    为了进一步发展少数民族地区的生产，据交通邮电部门初步规划：到1962年，公路通车里程要求达到一万二千公里，航运方面经过疏浚和整治，要求到1967年全省河道通轮驳船的里程增加到三千公里，铁路方面除进行巨大的技术改造计划，并计划修建五百多公里的新线。邮电方面在今年内完全达到乡乡通电话。可以想见，再过三年或五年后的广西交通邮电事业，将会有一个更大的跃进！
