    The Vietnamese Government's Peace Initiative
    From Indochina comes again the sound of a call for peace. On March 7th, Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, wrote to Ngo Dinh Diem, the head of the South Vietnamese authorities, expressing opposition to the interference of the American imperialists in South Vietnam, demanding the withdrawal of American military personnel from South Vietnam, the cessation of building new and expanding existing military bases, and preventing South Vietnam from being drawn into any military bloc in any form. At the same time, he proposed that the North and South parts of Vietnam should hold consultations to discuss disarmament and the restoration of North-South trade relations. This is a major effort by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to uphold the Geneva Accords, to strive for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and to strengthen peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people fully support this important proposal of the Vietnamese government.
    Since the signing of the Geneva Accords more than three years ago, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has conscientiously implemented the various provisions of the agreement and has repeatedly proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultations to discuss general elections, making many efforts to restore normal relations between the North and South and to unify the country. However, due to the obstruction of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group, these proposals have never been realized. The United States not only violated the Geneva Accords by placing South Vietnam under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Military Group, but also has been conspiring to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Aggression Bloc. At present, the U.S. military aid advisory group in South Vietnam has reached more than 1,000 people, and various military organizations of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, such as "inspection groups," "joint logistics offices," and "psychological warfare" departments, have been established in South Vietnam. U.S. military "advisors" control all powers of the South Vietnamese army from training to command. The United States is also actively supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem group in "conscription" and expanding its army, constantly importing arms into South Vietnam, and stepping up the construction of military bases. In the political field, U.S. "advisors" have also infiltrated all departments of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, actually controlling all administrative powers. In the economic field, South Vietnam has become a market for the United States to dump surplus goods. The United States is increasingly turning South Vietnam into its colony and military base. This approach by the United States not only completely violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords, constituting interference in Vietnam's internal affairs, but also poses a serious threat to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.
    The Geneva Accords stipulate that the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam should be respected, and that the Vietnamese people should enjoy the basic freedom to establish a democratic and unified state through general elections. In the past, the failure to achieve general elections in Vietnam and the failure to achieve peaceful reunification were mainly due to U.S. interference and obstruction. Now, in order to safeguard the independence, autonomy, and national dignity of the Vietnamese people, and to promote the cause of national reunification, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the United States stop its illegal interference in South Vietnam and withdraw its military personnel in South Vietnam, which is completely reasonable and justified. The United States is one of the countries involved in the Geneva Conference. If the United States still has a minimum sense of responsibility to abide by international morality, then it has no reason or basis to refuse this legitimate and reasonable demand.
    The issue of the peaceful reunification of Vietnam is one of the issues of greatest concern to peace-loving people in all countries of the world. Because if Vietnam achieves peaceful reunification, it will not only eliminate the pain of national division for the Vietnamese people, but also eliminate a source of war threat, contributing to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world. Not long ago, when President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam visited India and Myanmar, the joint statements issued with Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Myanmar Prime Minister U Nu expressed the desire to restore the unity of Vietnam through free general elections stipulated by the Geneva Accords.
    "Peaches and plums do not speak, yet a path is formed beneath them." Today, peace has become the universal demand of all mankind, and the forces of peace have certainly surpassed the forces of war. Especially recently, the Soviet government has put forward a series of peace initiatives, such as convening an East-West summit meeting, Poland has proposed that relevant countries begin to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has issued a statement on the peaceful reunification of Korea, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have announced that they will completely withdraw from Korea before the end of 1958, which has made it more possible for the West and the East to resolve major international issues through peaceful consultation. In this context, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has once again put forward positive proposals to the South Vietnamese authorities, hoping to jointly discuss ways to reduce troops and seek mutual trade through direct contact between the ruling authorities of both sides. This not only opens a path to strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, but also helps to create a peaceful atmosphere in Indochina and Asia. Will the South Vietnamese authorities follow the general trend of the world and the common aspirations of the Vietnamese people, accept the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and take a step forward for the peaceful reunification of their country and the maintenance of national sovereignty and dignity? Or will they be willing to be instigated by American colonialists, refuse to accept the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and continue to betray the people of their country and sell out national interests? Now is the time for them to consider and make a choice.
    Our Premier Zhou Enlai stated at the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress on February 10th: "As a participant in the Geneva Accords and a close neighbor of the Indochinese countries, China has always been concerned about the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the full implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Chinese government fully supports the unremitting efforts of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to promote the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and believes that the current situation in which the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam has been obstructed and undermined should not continue." We believe that with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, the struggle of the entire Vietnamese people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely overcome obstacles and achieve victory.

### 越南政府的和平倡议

    越南政府的和平倡议
    从印度支那，又传来了和平的号角声。越南民主共和国范文同总理在3月7日写信给南越当局负责人吴庭艳，表示反对美帝国主义者对南越的干涉，要求美国军事人员撤出南越，停止新建和扩建军事基地，并且不得以任何形式把南越拉入任何军事集团；同时提出建议，主张越南南北两部分进行协商，讨论裁军和恢复南北贸易关系问题。这是越南民主共和国为维护日内瓦协议、为争取越南的和平统一，为加强亚洲和世界的和平所作的一次重大努力，中国人民完全支持越南政府的这一重要建议。
    日内瓦协议签订后，三年多以来，越南民主共和国认真执行了协议的各项规定，而且一再向南越当局提出举行协商讨论普选的建议，为恢复南北之间的正常关系和国家的统一作了许多努力。但由于美国和吴庭艳集团的阻挠，这些建议始终未能实现。美国不仅破坏日内瓦协议，把南越置于东南亚军事集团的“保护”之下，而且一直阴谋把南越拉入东南亚侵略集团。目前美国在南越的军事援助顾问团已达一千多人，美国海陆空军的各种军事组织，如“视察团”、“联合后勤处”和“心理作战”部门等，都已在南越建立起来。美国军事“顾问”掌握了南越军队从训练到指挥的全部权限。美国还积极扶持吴庭艳集团“征兵”扩军，不断向南越输入军火，加紧修建军事基地。在政治方面，美国“顾问”也渗透到吴庭艳政权的一切部门，实际上掌握了一切行政权力。在经济方面，南越已经成为美国倾销剩余物资的市场。美国正在日益把南越变成它的殖民地和军事基地。美国的这种作法，不仅完全违反了日内瓦协议的规定，构成了干涉越南内政的事实，而且对于印度支那和东南亚地区的和平也造成了严重的威胁。
    日内瓦协议规定：应尊重越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整，应使越南人民享有通过普选建立一个民主的统一国家的基本自由。过去，越南普选的未能实现，和平统一的未能实现，主要是由于美国的干涉和阻挠。现在越南民主共和国为了维护越南人民的独立自主和民族尊严，为了促进祖国的统一事业，要求制止美国对于南越的非法干涉，撤出它在南越的军事人员，这是完全合理而且正当的。美国是参加日内瓦会议的有关国家之一，如果美国对于遵守国际道义还具有起码的责任感，那么它就没有任何理由和根据再来拒绝这种正当而合理的要求。
    越南的和平统一问题，是世界各国爱好和平人民所最关心的问题之一。因为，越南如果实现和平统一，不仅会使越南人民消除祖国分裂的痛苦，而且也会消除一个战争威胁的根源，有助于亚洲和世界和平的巩固。不久以前，越南民主共和国胡志明主席访问印度和缅甸的时候，同印度尼赫鲁总理、缅甸吴努总理发表的联合声明中，就都表示了通过日内瓦协议所规定的自由普选来恢复越南统一的愿望。
    “桃李无言，下自成蹊”，今天，和平已经成为全人类的普遍要求，和平力量已肯定地超过了战争力量。特别是最近以来，苏联政府提出了召开东西方最高会议等一系列和平倡议，波兰提出了有关国家着手建立中欧无原子区的建议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发表了关于和平统一朝鲜的声明，中国人民志愿军宣布1958年年底以前全部撤出朝鲜，这就使西方和东方通过和平协商解决国际间重大问题都有了更大的可能性。在这种情况下，越南民主共和国向南越当局再一次提出积极的建议，希望通过双方执政当局的直接接触，共同讨论裁减军队和寻求互通贸易的办法，这不仅为争取祖国的和平统一打开一条道路，而且会有助于缔造印度支那和亚洲的和平气氛。南越当局是顺应世界大势和越南人民的共同愿望，接受越南民主共和国的建议，为和平统一自己的国家、维护民族的主权和尊严而前进一步呢？还是甘愿受美国殖民者的教唆、拒绝接受越南民主共和国的建议、继续背叛祖国人民、出卖民族利益呢？现在是他们应该考虑和抉择的时候了。
    我国周恩来总理2月10日在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议上曾提出：“作为日内瓦协议的参加国和印度支那各国的近邻，中国一向关心印度支那和平的巩固和日内瓦协议的全面实施。中国政府全力支持越南民主共和国政府为促进越南的和平统一而作的不懈努力，并且认为目前日内瓦协议在越南的实施遭到阻挠和破坏的状况不应该再继续下去。”我们相信：在全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支援之下，越南全体人民争取祖国和平统一的斗争一定会突破障碍得到胜利。
