    "The Complete Works of Michurin" encompasses all of Michurin's writings throughout his life, comprising four volumes, and is a monumental work in the field of agricultural biological science. The first volume of the translated edition was published as early as October 1955, and the recently published volume is the second.
    The second volume focuses on the pomological descriptions of the varieties cultivated by Michurin, showcasing Michurin's creative, rich, and general biological theories on utilizing effective methods such as cross-pollination, pre-grafting vegetation, the mentor method, and the environmental influence method to create new varieties and control the development of plant organisms.
