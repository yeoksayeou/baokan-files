Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd – According to a Kyodo News report today, Liu Lianren, a wartime Chinese forced laborer recently discovered in Hokkaido by a Japanese person, issued a protest statement on February 26th.

The statement said: "I am not a soldier, but the Japanese army illegally captured me in violation of international law. I demand that the Japanese government compensate me for the material and mental losses I have suffered in the past fourteen years."

Liu Lianren was abducted from his hometown in Shandong by the Japanese invading army in 1944 and sent to work as a laborer in a mine in Hokkaido, Japan. Unable to bear the abuse, Liu Lianren escaped in June 1945 and wandered in the wilderness of Ishikari County for thirteen years. In view of the fact that Liu Lianren was a victim of the decision made by the Tojo Cabinet during the war to abduct Chinese laborers, the Japan Socialist Party decided to recently request that the current Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, who participated in the Tojo Cabinet meeting that made the above decision as a cabinet member, attend the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee to hold Kishi accountable for this matter.

Toshio Tanaka, a member of the Socialist Party’s House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke once said that he would "deeply reflect on the past war responsibilities." He said that the Liu Lianren incident is a good opportunity for Kishi Nobusuke to express his reflection through concrete actions. He said that he would raise this issue in the Diet and demand that the government be responsible for handling the Liu Lianren incident.

More than twenty days have passed since Liu Lianren was discovered, but the Hokkaido Prefectural Government, the Sapporo Municipal Government, and the local police authorities have still refused to provide Liu Lianren with assistance and protection. The Sapporo Immigration Bureau even issued an order on February 26th to summon Liu Lianren on the grounds that Liu Lianren was "suspected of illegally staying" in Japan.

The Overseas Chinese Association in Japan and the Committee for Comforting the Souls of Chinese Prisoner-of-War Martyrs sternly condemned the Japanese government's irresponsible attitude. They pointed out that Liu Lianren was illegally abducted based on the "Policy of Transporting Chinese Laborers into Japan" decided by the Tojo Cabinet at the cabinet meeting on November 27, 1942. This behavior violated international regulations. They believe that the Japanese government should bear full responsibility for the Liu Lianren incident; they demand that the Japanese government protect Liu Lianren, help him return to his country, and compensate him for his losses.

    刘连仁要日本政府赔偿损失
    日本政界和华侨总会表示支持
    新华社3日讯　据共同社今天报道，最近被一位日本人在北海道发现的战时中国被掳劳工刘连仁在2月26日发表了一篇抗议声明。
    声明说：“我不是士兵，但是日本军队违反国际法非法俘掳了我。我要求日本政府赔偿我在十四年间所受到的物质上和精神上的损失”。
    刘连仁在1944年被日本侵略军队从他的山东故乡掳走，被送往日本北海道矿山中作劳工。刘连仁不堪虐待，而在1945年6月逃亡，辗转流浪于无人的石狩郡原野达十三年。日本社会党鉴于刘连仁是战时东条内阁作出的关于掳走中国劳工决定的受害者，决定在最近要求当时以阁员身份参加作出上述决定的东条内阁会议的日本现任首相岸信介出席众议院外务委员会，向岸信介追究这件事情的责任。
    社会党众议院外务委员会委员田中稔男指出，岸信介曾经说过要“对过去的战争责任进行深刻的反省”。他说，刘连仁事件就是岸信介用具体行动来表示反省的好机会。他表示要在国会提出这个问题，要求政府负责处理刘连仁事件。
    刘连仁被发现已经有二十多天，但是北海道厅，札幌市政府和当地警察当局仍然拒绝给予刘连仁以救助和保护。日本入国管理局札幌事务所竟在2月26日以刘连仁有“非法逗留的嫌疑”为名，发出了传讯刘连仁的命令。
    在日本的华侨总会和中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会严厉谴责日本政府的不负责任的态度。它们指出，刘连仁是根据东条内阁在1942年11月27日内阁会议上决定的关于“把中国劳工运入日本内地的方针”而非法被掳的。这种行为违反了国际法规。它们认为，日本政府对刘连仁事件应负全部责任；它们要求日本政府保护刘连仁，帮助他回国，并且赔偿损失。
