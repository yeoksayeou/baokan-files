Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Commanders and leaders at all levels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are universally promoting the leadership method of "experimental companies." This has had a positive effect on promoting the great leap forward in all aspects of the troops' work, centered on training, and on improving leadership style.

The question of how to establish "experimental companies" in the troops and what methods to use has attracted widespread attention from Party committees and leading cadres at all levels. Many troop Party committees have also conducted special studies and made resolutions.

After the establishment of experimental companies in various units, the appearance of the companies has undergone great changes. Wang Hong, Deputy Commander of a certain anti-aircraft artillery division on the Fujian Front, led a working group to the Second Company to establish an experimental company. This has resulted in a double leap forward in the company's combat and training tasks. For two months, they lived in tents like the soldiers, ate in the open air, operated alongside them, and enjoyed entertainment together, which greatly encouraged the officers and soldiers of the company. In training, he used the method of grasping both ends and leading the middle, widely adopting methods such as observation, visits, discussions, and technical performances to promptly promote advanced experience. As a result, the command level and technical level of all officers and soldiers in the company were rapidly improved. In more than a month, from January 5th to February 15th, this company won four battles and shot down or damaged four invading Chiang Kai-shek military aircraft.

Senior Colonel Ma Lianhui, Commander of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, took a machine gun company as an experimental company. In late February, he took his luggage to the company to serve as the company commander. On the day he arrived at the company headquarters, he convened three meetings with officers, squad leaders, and soldiers respectively. After dinner, he went deep into the squads and talked with the soldiers. The next morning, as soon as the assembly horn sounded, he was already dressed neatly in the company commander's position, ready to command the entire company for drills. For a month, he has led the officers and soldiers of the entire company in training to gain first-hand experience in leading the combat training of the entire division. Once, when he was leading the officers and soldiers of the machine gun company to plant trees and afforest the camp, he discovered that digging pits for planting trees could be combined with the current training subject of "identification of earthwork tools" and "earthwork operations," so he immediately promoted it throughout the division.

Senior Colonel He Yunfeng, Political Commissar of a certain division of the Kunming Military Region, and Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Huamin, Deputy Commander, etc., took the Eighth Company of the Red Army Regiment of their subordinate troops as an experimental company. They changed into soldiers' uniforms and went to the Eighth Company to serve as soldiers. On the night of their arrival at the company, at a welcoming party held by all the officers and soldiers of the Eighth Company and representatives of officers and soldiers from various units, the political instructor officially announced the order, assigning Senior Colonel He Yunfeng to the first squad as a senior private and Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Huamin to the fourth squad as a senior private. From then on, they completely trained with the soldiers under the sun and in the dust, examining all aspects of work from the perspective of soldiers. In the evenings, after the soldiers rested, they would ask the squad leader for leave to study the problems they had discovered. Recently, Senior Colonel He Yunfeng and others wrote the first investigation report from the experimental company to the leading organs of the Kunming Military Region, putting forward many suggestions on the current training work of the troops, and making suggestions for improvement on some specific issues in the training work.

After the commanders of various units personally worked on experimental companies, they effectively promoted the work of the troops, further encouraged the enthusiasm and diligence of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, and played a role in changing customs and habits in the troops. At present, many commanders and机关 cadres have begun to work in the companies, and many battalion and company cadres have also gone deep into the companies and platoons to specifically guide and help the work of lower levels.

    首长下连队和士兵同吃同住同操作
    解放军普遍推广“试验连”
    据新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军各部队首长和各级领导机关普遍推广“试验连”的领导方法，对促进部队以训练为中心的各项工作大跃进和改进领导作风，都收到了良好的效果。
    如何在部队中搞“试验连”，用什么方法搞试验连，这个问题已经引起部队各级党委和各级领导干部的普遍重视。很多部队的党委还专门作了研究，作出了决议。
    各部队搞起试验连后，已使连队的面貌发生了很大的变化。福建前线某高射炮师副师长王宏带领一个工作组到二连搞试验连后，已使这个连队的作战、训练任务双双跃进。两个月来，他们同士兵一样地住帐篷，露天吃饭，同操作，同娱乐，给了连队官兵极大的鼓舞。在训练中，他运用抓两头、带中间的方法，广泛采取观摩、访问、座谈、技术表演等方式，及时推广先进经验。因而，迅速提高了全连官兵的指挥水平和技术水平。在1月5日到2月15日的一个多月中，这个连队四战四捷，击落击伤入侵的蒋军飞机四架。
    济南部队某部师长马连辉大校把一个机枪连作为试验连，2月下旬，他带着行李到这个连里当连长。他到达连部的当天，就召集军官、班长和战士，分别开了三个会。晚饭后，他又深入到各班和士兵谈心。第二天早晨，刚吹起集合号，他已经服装整齐地站在连长的位置上，准备指挥全连出操了。一个月以来，他通过亲自带领全连官兵进行训练，抓取第一手经验，来领导全师的战斗训练。有一次，他在领导机枪连官兵植树绿化营地时，发现植树刨坑可以和当前训练科目的“土工工具的识别”、“土工作业”相结合，就立即在全师中推广了。
    昆明部队某师政治委员何云峰大校、副师长张化民中校等把所属部队的红军团第八连作为试验连，他们换上士兵的服装，到八连里当兵。到达连队的当天晚上，在八连全体官兵和各单位的军官、士兵代表举行的欢迎晚会上，指导员正式宣布命令，把何云峰大校编入该连第一班任上等兵，张化民中校编入该连第四班任上等兵。从此，他们完全和战士一起，在太阳下、尘土里，滚爬操练，从兵的角度来考察各项工作。晚上，战士们休息了，他们便向班长请假去研究发现的问题。最近，何云峰大校等从试验连里给昆明部队领导机关写了第一分考察报告，对部队当前训练工作提出了许多建议，并针对训练工作中的一些具体问题提出了改进意见。
    各部队首长亲自搞试验连以后，有效地推动了部队的各项工作，更加鼓舞了广大官兵的干劲和钻劲，而且在部队里起了移风易俗的影响。目前，许多部队首长和机关干部已开始到连队办公，许多营、连干部也纷纷深入到连、排里具体指导和帮助下级工作。
