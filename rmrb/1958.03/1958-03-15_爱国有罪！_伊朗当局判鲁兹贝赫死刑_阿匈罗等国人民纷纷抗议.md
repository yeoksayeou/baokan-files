    Patriotism is a Crime!
    Iranian Authorities Sentence Rouzbeh to Death
    People in Albania, Hungary, Romania and Other Countries Protest
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Tehran News: The Iranian military court sentenced Khosrow Rouzbeh, a well-known Iranian patriot, to death on February 25.
    Rouzbeh was an outstanding fighter for national independence, democracy, and peace for the Iranian people. He was repeatedly persecuted by the Iranian authorities and imprisoned many times, but he remained steadfast and was loved by the Iranian people. He was most recently arrested last July, and was seriously injured at the time of his arrest. After a period of treatment in a prison hospital, he was handed over to a military court and recently sentenced to death on trumped-up charges.
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The people of Albania, Hungary, and Romania protested the Iranian government's death sentence against Iranian patriot and People's Party leader Khosrow Rouzbeh.
    The Albanian Islamic Association, in its protest telegram to Iranian Prime Minister Eghbal on the 11th, said that sentencing a patriot who seeks the happiness of the motherland and world peace to death is contrary to religious morality.
    The Albanian Islamic Association also sent telegrams to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, and Muslims in Iran, demanding that the Iranian government immediately release Rouzbeh.
    According to Budapest newspapers, workers in factories, production cooperatives, and organizations throughout Hungary, upon hearing the news of the death sentence against Iranian patriot Rouzbeh, protested one after another, believing that the Iranian government's action was a brutal deprivation of the people's freedom rights, and they demanded that the Iranian government release Rouzbeh and the patriots arrested with him.
    Romanian scientists, Professor Parhon, Academician of the Academy of Sciences, and Academician Zaharia Stancu, also sent telegrams to the Iranian government respectively, protesting the Iranian military court's death sentence against Rouzbeh.
