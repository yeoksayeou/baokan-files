Xinhua News Agency, March 7th – Cai Chang, Chairperson of the All-China Women's Federation, today issued a call at the capital's gathering of women from all circles commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day, urging women across the country to summon even greater revolutionary zeal and strive for the complete victory of the 1958 nationwide rectification movement and the realization of an all-round great leap forward in socialist construction.

In her speech, Cai Chang, reviewing the efforts and contributions made by women across the country last year, said that on the basis of carrying out the socialist education movement, Chinese women have actively implemented the resolution passed by the Third National Women's Congress on building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, and striving for socialist construction. They have further raised their awareness, strengthened their national and collective consciousness, and enhanced the integration of love for the country, the society, and the family. Consequently, the great unity of women of all nationalities and strata across the country has been further strengthened, and a mighty current of the great leap forward has been formed. Now, whether in industry or agriculture, whether in building the country or managing households, women have begun to plunge into the upsurge of finding the advanced, learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. The initiatives from women in all fields against waste and conservatism, and competing for more, faster, better, and more economical results, are blooming everywhere like spring flowers.

Cai Chang then put forward requirements on how to achieve this year's tasks. First, she hoped that women across the country would further raise their socialist consciousness, establish a socialist labor concept and collectivist thinking, and truly consciously labor for socialism, so as to better break down conservative ideas and promote a great leap forward in production. Second, she hoped that female workers, rural women, and women in all walks of life, in actively participating in the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the socialist emulation drive, must summon up their drive and learn technology in order to continuously increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, and reduce waste. They must be determined to study diligently and perseveringly, and overcome all difficulties. Third, she hoped that all women cadres would closely keep up with the development of the current situation, enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, go to the masses, go to practice, participate in the appraisal and competition of finding the advanced and catching up with the advanced, and learn the working methods of experimental fields. To this end, she called on women cadres to have the ambition, determination, and perseverance to eliminate bureaucracy, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness in their work and lives. Everyone should oppose waste and conservatism, compare political thought, and compare the study of professional skills and technology, summon up drive, strive for both red and expert, and be thoroughly red and deeply expert, and become true revolutionary promoters. All levels of women's federations must also, in this movement of an all-round great leap forward in socialist construction, under the leadership of the local party committees, resolutely change their conservative ideas and dragging work styles, carry out appraisals and competitions between women's federation organizations, and let women's work also have a great leap forward.

In her speech, Cai Chang also pointed out the international obligations of Chinese women. She asked women across the country to accelerate China's socialist construction, and use this practical action to enhance the friendship and unity between Chinese women and women of all countries, and strengthen the forces for defending world peace. At the same time, they should also care for and support all international measures that are conducive to promoting world peace.

At the end of her speech, Cai Chang expressed her gratitude and condolences to the female experts and experts' wives from the Soviet Union and other countries who came to help with China's construction, and expressed her gratitude to all women of all countries and the wives of ambassadors from all countries to China who sincerely care about China's socialist construction and give us friendship and support.

    蔡畅在讲话中回顾全国妇女在去年所作的努力和贡献时说，我国妇女在开展社会主义教育运动的基础上，积极贯彻执行了全国第三次妇女代表大会通过的勤俭建国、勤俭持家、为建设社会主义而奋斗的决议，进一步提高了觉悟，加强了国家观念和集体观念，增进了爱国、爱社、爱家相一致的思想。因而进一步加强了全国各民族、各阶层妇女的大团结，并且形成了一股大跃进的巨流。现在，不论是在工业或农业方面，不论是在建设国家或是持家方面，妇女已开始投入到找先进、学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮中。来自各个方面妇女们的反浪费反保守、比多快好省的倡议，也像春花一样到处开放。
    蔡畅接着就如何实现今年的任务提出了要求。她首先希望全国妇女要进一步提高社会主义觉悟，树立社会主义的劳动观念和集体主义思想，做到真正自觉地为社会主义而劳动，更好地打破保守思想，促进生产的大跃进。其次，她希望全国女职工、农村妇女以及各行各业妇女，在积极参加增产节约运动和社会主义竞赛中，为了不断地增加生产、提高质量、降低成本、减少浪费，必须鼓足干劲和学习技术，要决心勤钻苦学，坚持克服一切困难。第三，她希望全体妇女干部，要紧紧跟上目前形势的发展，要热烈响应党中央和毛主席的号召，到群众中去，到实际中去，参加找先进、赶先进的评比和竞赛，学会搞试验田的工作方法。为此，她号召妇女干部必须要有志气、有决心、有毅力地打掉工作上和生活上的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，大家都来反浪费、反保守、比政治思想、比钻研业务和技术，鼓足干劲，争取又红又专，红透专深，当真正的革命促进派。各级妇联组织也都要在这次社会主义建设全面大跃进的运动中，在各地党委的领导之下，坚决改变自己的保守思想和拖拉的作风，开展妇联组织之间的评比和竞赛，让妇女工作也来个大跃进。
    蔡畅在讲话中同时指出了我国妇女的国际义务。她要求全国妇女加速我国社会主义的建设，以此实际行动来增进我国妇女与各国妇女的友好和团结，增强保卫世界和平的力量；同时还要关心和支持国际上一切有利于促进世界和平的措施。
    蔡畅在讲话结束时，对前来帮助我国建设的苏联和其它各国的女专家和专家夫人表示感谢和慰问，并对一切真诚关怀我国社会主义建设事业、给予我们友谊和支持的各国妇女、各国驻中国使节的夫人们，表示感谢。
