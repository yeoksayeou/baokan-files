Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 14th: Workers at the Nanjing Railway Station of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have broken with years of convention and, starting from the 13th, are keeping ticket windows open all day long, allowing passengers to buy tickets whenever they arrive.

Previously, the Nanjing Railway Station's ticket windows would close during morning and evening shift changes and at lunchtime, resulting in over three hours of ticket sales being suspended. Furthermore, tickets were not sold from midnight to 5:00 AM. During these times, many passengers would often gather in front of the ticket windows. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, workers decided to adopt methods such as staggered shifts and designated-number handovers to ensure that the windows remain open twenty-four hours a day. The implementation of this method on March 13th has been very effective; the long snake lines have not reappeared, and passengers are very satisfied.

    全天都卖票  “长蛇”不见了
    据新华社南京14日电  上海铁路管理局南京车站职工打破多年常规，从13日起，售票窗口全日敞开，旅客可以随到随买。
    南京车站售票窗口原来每天在早、晚交接班和中午吃饭时都要关窗，为此要停售车票三个多小时；深夜零点到五点钟不售车票。在这些时间内，售票窗前往往要聚集很多旅客。职工在反浪费反保守运动中，决定采用交叉交接、对号交接等办法，做到二十四小时不关窗口。3月13日实行这种办法后，效果很好，一字长蛇阵再没出现过，旅客非常满意。
