    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 23rd: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front today issued a communique, describing the proceedings of the Seventh Enlarged Conference of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front and the significant achievements made.

    The main leaders of various parties and organizations participating in the Vietnam Fatherland Front, non-party figures, representatives of overseas Chinese, deputy ministers and ministers of various government departments, and members of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly participated in this conference, which was held from March 10th to 21st.

    The conference listened to reports on the domestic and international situation made by representatives of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government, and discussed the two declarations of the Moscow Conference, as well as the transition of North Vietnam to socialism and the struggle for the unification of Vietnam. The communique said that the conference engaged in enthusiastic discussions on these issues and finally reached a completely unified understanding.

    The communique said that the representatives of the various parties and organizations participating in the conference fully supported the position taken by the Vietnam people on international affairs as proposed by the Labor Party: resolutely stand on the side of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, continuously strengthen friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, and actively contribute to safeguarding peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    The conference unanimously held that the main content of the era is the transition from capitalism to socialism; the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system.

    On domestic issues, the parties and organizations unanimously agreed that after the restoration of peace, North Vietnam does not need to go through the stage of developing capitalism and can directly transition to socialism. Only by moving towards socialism can the North become strong and become a base for the struggle for a unified country.

    The conference unanimously held that opposing US interference in South Vietnam is the direct task of the people of the South and also the task of the people of the whole country.

    The conference affirmed the necessity of the working class and the Labor Party leading the Vietnamese revolution. The conference believes that in the current domestic and international situation, the role and tasks of the Vietnam Fatherland Front have become even more significant. Therefore, all members of the Fatherland Front must correctly apply the principles of criticism and self-criticism on the basis of unity, help each other, and make progress together.
