    The Shui ethnic group has a population of over 130,000, mainly distributed in Sandu, Libo, Dushan, Duyun, Danzhai, Rongjiang, and other counties in southeastern Guizhou Province. Some are scattered in the northwest of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Shui people refer to themselves as "Bu Shui," "Fen Shui," and "Ai Shui." They are mainly engaged in agricultural production and are skilled in planting rice, corn, cotton, and other crops. Before liberation, their farming techniques were backward, and there were many handicraftsmen. Almost every village had skilled iron, wood, stone, bamboo, and bricklaying artisans. The Shui ethnic group has its own language and writing system. The language belongs to the Dong-Tai language family, and the writing resembles hieroglyphs.
    The Gelao ethnic group (仡 is pronounced "Ge," 佬 is pronounced "Lao") has a population of over 20,000, mainly residing in Guanling, Langdai, Qianxi, Zhijin, and other counties in Guizhou Province. In September 1957, there were 307 people in Guangxi. The Gelao ethnic group is a nation that evolved from the ancient major ethnic group "Liao." The economy is mainly based on agricultural production. Some Gelao people are famous for their handicrafts. They have their own independent language, but no writing system.

    水家族、仡佬族
    水家族共有十三万多人，主要分布在贵州省东南部三都、荔波、独山、都匀、丹寨、榕江等县。部分散居于广西僮族自治区的西北部。水家族自称“布水”、“分水”、“爱水”。主要从事农业生产，擅长栽种稻谷、玉米、棉花等作物，解放前耕作技术落后，手工业者相当多，几乎每个村寨都有熟练的铁、木、石、竹、泥水工匠。水家族有自己语言和文字。语言属洞台语系，文字类似象形文字。
    仡佬族（仡音葛、佬音老）共有二万多人口，主要聚居在贵州省关岭、郎岱、黔西、织金等县。1957年9月间在广西的有三百零七人。仡佬族是从古代的大种族“僚”分化出来的民族。经济以农业生产为主。一部分仡佬人以从事手工业出名。有自己独立的语言，但没有文字。
