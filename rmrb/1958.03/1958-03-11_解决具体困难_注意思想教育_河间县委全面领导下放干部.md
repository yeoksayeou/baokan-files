Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Reporter Li Pu reports: The Hejian County Party Committee of Hebei Province has adopted various measures to strengthen its leadership over transferred cadres in all aspects.

    Solving Specific Difficulties
    Since the transfer of cadres from central government agencies to Hejian County at the end of last year, the Hejian County Party Committee has shown great concern for them, and has organized special personnel to visit and hold discussions with them many times. When problems are discovered, they are studied and resolved in a timely manner. For example, the County Party Committee discovered that the transferred cadres' food intake had greatly increased due to their engagement in physical labor, and that the original grain supply standard was no longer sufficient, which affected their relationship with their landlords. Therefore, it was decided to supply grain according to a standard based on the number of people; the original monthly food allowance of seven yuan was also appropriately increased. In order to allow the transferred cadres a certain amount of time to handle their own affairs, such as haircuts and laundry, the County Party Committee, referring to the situation of ordinary farmers, decided to give them two days of vacation per month.

    The Hejian County Party Committee also stipulated that model figures and model deeds who actively participate in labor training and have good relations with the masses should be summarized in a timely manner and commended through the "Hejian Peasant News," "Radio Station," or circulars. Conversely, criticisms should be made, and those who make mistakes should be appropriately dealt with.

    Doing Good Ideological Work
    In order to do a good job in leading and managing the transferred cadres, the County Party Committee decided that this issue should be studied at the monthly County Party Committee expanded meetings and the weekly County Party Committee Standing Committee meetings. The County Party Committee also designated a secretary and a minister to be responsible for overseeing this work; the Organization Department of the County Party Committee added a cadre to be responsible for monitoring the daily situation. All townships with transferred cadres also designated specific personnel for management. From the end of last year to the past one or two months, in addition to the County Party Committee members frequently contacting and interacting with the transferred cadres, and the township Party Committee secretaries and township heads helping to solve problems, soliciting opinions, and reporting to the county in a timely manner, on February 5th, the County Party Committee also held a symposium of main leaders of relevant townships and cooperatives to report on the management and education of transferred cadres, and criticized the tendency of some township and cooperative party organizations to be overly "polite" to new commune members. For example, some transferred cadres initially wavered in their thinking and lacked confidence in labor training, and some had tense relations with their landlords due to living problems, but the township and cooperative party organizations did not promptly criticize the transferred cadres.

    In order to facilitate the unified leadership of local party organizations over the transferred cadres, the County Party Committee unified the transferred Party and League members and the Party and League members of rural branches into groups to participate in Party and League life together, so that the transferred cadres could learn the good ideological qualities of diligence and frugality from the rural Party and League members. The rural Party and League members were asked to explain the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program and give Party lectures, etc., while also conducting criticism and self-criticism. After Wang Huijuan and Liu Jianying, transferred cadres from Donggao Village, criticized the Party member team leaders Wang Yuechi and Zhang Shuhua at the Party meeting for not being active in leading commune members in labor, they quickly made improvements.

    Supplying Cultural Nourishment
    In order to help transferred cadres regularly study and understand the Party's policies, in addition to subscribing to People's Daily, Hebei Daily, Cangzhou Daily, Hejian Peasant News, as well as Study Magazine, China Youth and other newspapers and magazines themselves, the County Party Committee also extracted 20 copies of internal Party publications and distributed them to Party group leaders. At the same time, all work plans, instructions, and circulars issued by the County Party Committee to the townships were given to each group leader to keep them informed of the County Party Committee's work focus in each period. As for theoretical and cultural studies, the County Party Committee Propaganda Department is also preparing to make unified arrangements, and the required documents will be assisted by the Propaganda Department or the Cultural Center. When the County Party Committee makes political reports to township-level full-time cadres, it also absorbs transferred cadres to participate.

    Helping to Learn Technology
    Learning agricultural technology is one of the primary problems encountered by transferred cadres in labor training. In order to solve this problem, the County Party Committee proposed that each agricultural cooperative should hold forums for old farmers according to different seasons, absorb transferred cadres to participate, exchange production experience, and help them sign contracts with experienced old farmers to guarantee teaching and learning. The party organizations of all cooperatives have made arrangements or plans in this regard according to the instructions of the County Party Committee. At present, the vast majority of the transferred cadres have learned seven or eight kinds of skills such as using shovels, carrying burdens, and spreading manure.

    Forming Transferred Cadres into Groups
    The method of the Hejian County Party Committee of forming the cadres transferred to one village or cooperative into a group and conducting political and ideological work through it is relatively good. The more than 170 cadres transferred to Hejian this time formed 20 groups. Each group established regular meeting, study, and summary systems to strengthen the ideological leadership of the transferred cadres. The Qiuzhuang group initially discovered that some comrades missed their families, were ideologically volatile, and lacked confidence in labor training. They conducted ideological self-examinations through studying the article "Several Understandings of the Transfer of Cadres" in "Study Magazine," and the problem was resolved. Because the Hejian County Party Committee paid attention to caring from all aspects, especially strengthening leadership politically, the thinking of these transferred cadres has begun to change, and their performance in labor is also very good. Forty-six people have been rated as models.

### 解决具体困难　注意思想教育  河间县委全面领导下放干部

    解决具体困难　注意思想教育
    河间县委全面领导下放干部
    本报特约新华社专稿　记者李朴报道：中共河北省河间县委采取各种措施，从各方面加强对下放干部的领导。
    解决具体困难
    去年年底中央国家机关下放干部到河间县以后，河间县委对他们非常关心，曾多次组织专人访问，和他们座谈。发现问题，及时研究解决。例如县委发现下放干部因为从事体力劳动饭量大为增加，按原来的粮食标准供应已不够吃，而且影响到他们和房东的关系后，就确定按以人定量的标准供应；对原来规定每月七元的伙食费，也适当予以提高。为了使下放干部能有一定的时间处理自己的事务，如理发、洗衣服等，县委参照一般农民的情况，研究确定每月给他们两天的假期。
    河间县委还规定要对积极劳动锻炼、和群众关系好的模范人物模范事迹，及时进行总结，通过“河间农民报”、“广播站”或通报等形式进行表扬。反之要提出批评，对犯错误的也要适当进行处理。
    作好思想工作
    为了作好对下放干部的领导和管理工作，县委确定在每月一次的县委扩大会和每周一次的县委常委会上，都要研究这一方面的问题。县委还确定一个书记和一个部长负责掌握这个工作；县委组织部增设一个干部，负责掌握日常情况，凡有下放干部的乡也都定了专人管理。从去年年底到今年的一两个月内，除了县委委员经常和下放干部进行联系、接触，各乡党委书记、乡长随时帮助解决问题，征求意见，及时向县汇报外，2月5日，县委还召开了有关乡、社主要干部的座谈会，汇报了对下放干部管理教育的情况，并批判了有些乡、社党组织对新社员过分“客气”的倾向。如有的下放干部开初思想动摇，对劳动锻炼信心不足，有的因为生活问题和房东关系曾一度紧张，而乡、社党组织却没有对下放干部及时提出批评。
    为了便于当地党组织对下放干部的统一领导，县委将下放的党、团员和农村支部的党、团员统一编组，一起过党、团生活，以便让下放干部学习农村党、团员勤俭朴素等好的思想品质，而农村党、团员就请他们讲解农业发展纲要四十条以及上党课等等，同时并进行批评和自我批评。东郜村下放干部王慧娟、刘建英在党的会议上向党员队长王月池、张树华提出领导社员劳动不积极的批评后，他们很快就有了改进。
    供给文化食粮
    为了帮助下放干部经常学习和了解党的政策，除他们自己订阅了人民日报、河北日报、沧州报、河间农民报以及学习杂志、中国青年等报刊外，县委还抽集党内刊物二十份分发给党员组长，同时凡县委发到乡的工作计划、指示、通报等均发各组长一份，让他们及时了解县委各段的工作中心。至于理论、文化学习，县委宣传部也准备作统一的安排，所需的文件由宣传部或文化馆协助解决。县委向乡级脱产干部作政治报告时，也吸收下放干部参加。
    帮助学习技术
    学会农业技术，是下放干部劳动锻炼中遇到的首要问题之一。为了解决这个问题，县委提出各农业社要根据不同季节召开老农座谈会，吸收下放干部参加，交流生产经验，并且帮助他们同有经验的老农订包教保学合同。各社党组织都根据县委指示在这方面作了安排或计划。现在，绝大部分下放干部都已学会了拿锨、担挑、撒粪等七八种技术了。
    把下放干部组成小组
    中共河间县委将下放到一个村、社的干部组成一个小组，通过它进行政治思想工作的方法是较好的。这次下放到河间的一百七十多名干部组成了二十个小组，各组建立了定期的会议、学习、总结等制度，加强了对下放干部的思想领导。丘庄小组开始发现有些同志想家，思想动荡，对劳动锻炼缺乏信心，就通过学习“学习杂志”上“对干部下放的几点认识”的文章，每人都进行了思想检查，问题获得解决。由于河间县委注意从各方面关心，特别是从政治上加强了领导，这批下放干部思想上已经开始发生了变化，在劳动中的表现也很好，已有四十六人被评为模范。
