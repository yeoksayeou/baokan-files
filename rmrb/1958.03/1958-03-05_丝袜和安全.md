Notes

	Stockings and Security
	In his "Mutual Security Program" message to Congress on February 19, Eisenhower emphasized that foreign aid appropriations were related to U.S. security and could not be cut.
	Ten days later, the House Foreign Affairs Committee revealed that the General Accounting Office of the Federal Government pointed out in a secret testimony meeting that U.S. military aid to Turkey included a large number of nylon stockings, musical instruments, swivel chairs, and cold drinks. General Twining, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who attended the meeting, admitted that all of this was true.
	It is indeed incredible that nylon stockings can protect U.S. security. However, when you get to the bottom of it, it's not surprising. What the Eisenhower administration is trying to maintain as the so-called "security" of the United States is actually nothing more than the profits of the big bosses.

    丝袜和安全
    艾森豪威尔在2月19日致国会的“共同安全计划”咨文中强调说援外拨款有关美国安全，是万万不能削减的。
    十天以后，美国众院外交委员会透露：据联邦政府总会计署在一次秘密作证会议上指出，在美国对土耳其提供的军事援助中有大量尼龙丝袜、乐器、转椅和冷饮品。出席会议的美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁承认，这一切全是事实。
    尼龙丝袜居然可以保护美国的安全，这真是不可思议的事。不过，说穿了也不奇怪。艾森豪威尔政府竭力想维护的所谓美国的“安全”，实际上不过是大老板们的利润而已。
