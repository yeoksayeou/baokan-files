    Small Sugar Mill in a Farm
    The small sugar mill in the Beijing State-run Southern Suburb Farm has officially started production.
    The Southern Suburb Farm planted over 1,400 mu of sugar beets as feed for dairy cows, with an annual yield of over 7 million jin of sugar beets, which were previously used directly as feed. In order to comprehensively utilize resources, the Southern Suburb Farm sent people to Wuwei, Gansu, to learn the indigenous method of sugar production from sugar beets. After returning, they built a 220-square-meter factory building in a simple manner, spending only 8,500 yuan in construction funds, including the sugar-making equipment. This factory can process five tons of sugar beets per day, producing 1,200 jin of brown and white sugar. Based on 180 days of production per year, it can produce 220,000 jin of brown and white sugar. The by-product molasses can be used to brew 20,000 jin of 65-proof white spirit, and the remaining beet pulp is still good feed. (Qun Li)

    农场里的小糖厂
    北京国营南郊农场的小糖厂，已经正式开工生产。
    南郊农场种了一千四百多亩给奶牛作饲料甜菜，年产甜菜达七百多万斤，过去都是直接用作饲料。为了综合利用资源，南郊农场派人到甘肃武威学习了甜菜土法制糖的方法，回来后就因陋就简地修建了二百二十平方公尺的厂房，连同制糖设备，一共只花八千五百元建设资金。这个厂每天可以处理甜菜五吨，制成红、白糖一千二百斤，按全年生产一百八十天计，可产红白糖二十二万斤，副产品糖蜜可酿六十五度白酒二万斤，剩下的糖丝，仍然是良好的饲料。（群力）
