    New Records Continue to Emerge in the Paper Industry
    Paper Bureau Requires Large Paper Mills
    To Focus on Increasing Output Per Hour (with Chart)
    Paper Industry Leap Forward Record Table (As of March 23, 1958)
    Note: The output in the table is the hourly output per unit volume (cubic meter).
    
    (Our report) Amidst the nationwide leap forward surge, the paper industry is constantly creating new records.
    The peak of record-breaking momentum in the entire industry originated from the Tianjin, Yingkou, and Jinzhou paper mills, all of which use reed pulp for papermaking. After the three factories launched a competition to see who was more advanced, leap forward records appeared one after another: the time for cooking a batch of reed pulp was continuously shortened from four to five hours in the fourth quarter of last year to two hours and fifty-one minutes, one hour and forty-seven minutes, and one hour and fourteen minutes. Before liberation, it took fourteen to twenty-four hours to cook a batch of reed pulp, and even in the early days after liberation, it took about twelve hours. If the equipment is balanced according to one hour and fourteen minutes, the pulp production will be greatly increased.
    The two paper mills manufacturing sulfite wood pulp—Shixian and Kaishantun—competed with each other and jointly achieved improvements by repeatedly setting new records for shortening cooking time in less than ten days. The cooking time for sulfite wood pulp was shortened from the original six to seven hours per batch to three hours and forty-eight minutes (Shixian) and three hours and forty minutes (Kaishantun) per batch.
    The cooking time for bleached rice straw pulp at the Tangshan State-owned Paper Mill set three new records in five days from March 6th to 10th, shortening from the original seven hours and fifteen minutes per batch of pulp to two hours and thirty minutes, two hours and sixteen minutes, and one hour and fifty-six minutes. On March 10th, four long-net paper machines at the Jilin Paper Mill increased their speed. On March 14th, eight round-net paper machines in Shanghai exceeded a speed of one hundred meters per minute; the city's paper production on March 14th increased by 10% compared to the 13th. The round-net paper machine at the Tianjin Paper Company's Renmin No. 1 Factory reached a record of one hundred and forty meters per minute. According to statistics from the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, as of March 23rd, there were more than eighty telegrams from paper mills all over the country reporting the creation of leap forward records.
    Recently, the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry made new plans for the movement to create leap forward records in the entire industry: requiring the several large wood pulp and reed pulp paper mills in Shixian, Kaishantun, Guangzhou, Jiamusi, Yingkou, Jinzhou, and Tianjin to quickly shift the focus of creating leap forward records from shortening cooking time to the indicator of increasing output per unit hour, so as to achieve the requirement of increased production on the basis of rapid cooking. Small cooking pots and various types of paper machines in various regions should still focus on shortening cooking time and increasing vehicle speed as the main directions for creating leap forward records.

    造纸业新纪录不断涌现
    造纸局要求大型纸厂
    今后着重提高单位小时产量（附图表）
    造纸工业跃进纪录台（截至1958年3月23日）
    注：表中产量为单位容积（立方公尺）小时产量。
    本报讯　在全国跃进浪潮中，造纸工业不断创造新纪录。
    全行业创造跃进纪录的洪峰，首先来自用芦苇制浆造纸的天津、营口、锦州三个同类纸厂。三个厂展开比先进的竞赛以后，跃进纪录接连出现：蒸煮一锅苇浆的时间，由去年第四季的四至五小时，连续缩短到二小时五十一分，一小时四十七分，一小时十四分。解放以前，煮一锅芦苇浆要用十四到二十四小时，解放初期也用十二小时左右。如果按一小时十四分平衡设备以后，纸浆产量将会大大增加。
    两个制造亚硫酸木浆的造纸厂——石岘和开山屯互相竞赛，在不到十天的时间内，连创几次缩短蒸煮时间的新纪录，两个厂共同获得了提高。亚硫酸木浆蒸煮时间，由原来六至七小时煮一锅，缩短到三小时四十八分（石岘）和三小时四十分（开山屯）煮一锅。
    地方国营唐山造纸厂的漂白稻草浆的蒸煮时间，在3月6日到10日五天当中三创新纪录，由原来的七小时十五分煮一球浆，缩短到二小时三十分、二小时十六分、一小时五十六分。3月10日这一天，吉林造纸厂有四台长网造纸机提高了车速。3月14日这一天，上海市有八台圆网造纸机的车速越过了每分钟一百公尺；这个市3月14日的纸张产量比13日提高10％。天津造纸公司人民一厂圆网纸机的车速达到每分钟一百四十公尺的纪录。据轻工业部造纸工业管理局统计，到3月23日止，来自祖国各地纸厂的创造跃进纪录的电报，共有八十多封。
    最近，轻工业部造纸局对全行业创造跃进纪录的运动做出了新的规划：要求石岘、开山屯、广州、佳木斯、营口、锦州、天津几个大型的木浆和苇浆纸厂，迅速把创造跃进纪录的重点，由缩短蒸煮时间立即转到提高单位小时产量这个指标上去，以便在快煮的基础上，实现多产的要求。各地小型蒸球和各种类型的造纸机，仍以缩短蒸煮时间和提高车速为创造跃进纪录的主要方向。　　　　　（张核）
