    Dulles Admits Defeat Behind the Scenes
    The United States Cannot Catch Up with the Soviet Union in Controlling Outer Space
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th — According to materials released by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on the evening of the 9th, Secretary of State Dulles admitted during a recent closed-door meeting of the committee that the United States cannot catch up with the Soviet Union in controlling outer space.
    Dulles said, "I don't know how much it will cost to go to the moon, or whether we can beat the Russians in the race." He said that the Soviet Union "had a better start than the United States in outer space exploration," and "although the United States is shortening this distance, I don't think it can be done immediately, and perhaps we cannot do it as quickly as they can. As for how much it will cost us to fight for second place, I don't know."

    杜勒斯在背地里认输
    美国对控制外层空间赶不上苏联
    据新华社10日讯　据美国众议院外交委员会9日晚上公布的材料，国务卿杜勒斯最近在委员会的一次秘密会议上作证时承认，美国在控制外层空间方面无法追上苏联。
    杜勒斯说：“我不知道到月亮去要花多少代价，或者我们是否可能在竞赛中胜过俄国人。”他说，苏联在“外层空间探索方面比美国开的头要好”，“虽然美国在缩短这个距离，但是我想不能马上就做到，并且也许我们不能像他们那样快地做到。至于我们要花多少代价来争取第二位，我就不知道了。”
