    (Reported by this newspaper) Polish industrial production plan for February this year has been overfulfilled. In some major industrial sectors, especially the coal mining industry, output has increased. Hard coal production in February reached 7.64 million tons, exceeding the same period last year by 100,000 tons; in terms of the average daily output per coal miner, it was 1,120 kilograms in February last year, while it was 1,165 kilograms in February this year, an increase of 45 kilograms in individual daily output. This shows that the labor productivity of the Polish coal mining industry has improved again. At the same time, labor organization in coal mines is being improved according to the assembly line work method, and it is estimated that production will continue to grow. In addition, brown coal production in February exceeded the plan by 8%, reaching 541,000 tons, an increase of 137,000 tons compared with the same period last year.

    The output value of factories and mines under the Ministry of Heavy Industry also increased by an average of 7% in February this year compared with February last year. Compared with January this year, the output value increased by 200 million zlotys. The metallurgy and machine manufacturing sectors increased by 6%, while electricity increased by 20%. The output of durable consumer goods such as radio equipment, motorcycles, sewing machines, electric refrigerators, bicycles, and furniture increased in February.

    The light industry sector also fully achieved the February production target. For example, in textile industrial enterprises, cotton spinning increased by 2%-6%. Wool textile enterprises in northern Poland not only completed the February task but also made up for the shortfall in January. At the same time, the output of the chemical industry increased by 17.2% compared with the same period last year, and nitrogen fertilizer, phosphate fertilizer, and rayon also overfulfilled the monthly plan.

    波兰工业顺利发展
    二月份的生产计划已经超额完成采煤、冶金和机器制造产量增加
    本报讯　波兰今年2月份的工业生产计划已经超额完成了。在一些主要的工业部门中，特别是采煤业，产量都有了增加。2月份硬煤产量达七百六十四万吨，超过去年同期十万吨；以每个采煤工人的平均日产量来看，去年2月份是一千一百二十公斤，而今年2月份是一千一百六十五公斤，个人日产量提高了四十五公斤。这说明波兰采煤工业的劳动生产率又有所提高。与此同时，煤矿中的劳动组织正在根据流水作业工作方法加以改进，估计生产仍要继续增长。另外。2月份褐煤产量超过计划的8％，达到五十四万一千吨，同去年同期比较，增加了十三万七千吨。
    重工业部所属各厂矿企业的产值，今年2月也比去年2月平均增加了7％。同今年1月相比，产值增加了两亿兹罗提。冶金和机器制造两个部门增加6％，而电力则增加20％。耐用消费品如无线电器材、摩托车、缝纫机、电气冰箱、自行车和家具等项的产量，在2月份都有所增加。
    轻工业部门也完全实现了2月份的生产任务，例如纺织工业企业，棉纺增产了2％—6％，波兰北部的毛纺企业不仅完成了2月份的任务，还补足了1月份的差额。同时，化学工业的产量比去年同期增加了17.2％，氮肥、磷肥和人造丝等也都超额完成了月计划。
