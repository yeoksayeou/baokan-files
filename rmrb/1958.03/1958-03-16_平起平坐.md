    Equal Footing
    Zhou Cheng
    As seen in the People's Daily on March 4th: Shanxi Province is vigorously promoting "turning potatoes from a supplementary food into a staple food," and "allowing potatoes to stand on equal footing with grain." I never thought they would have such a day of pride, which is truly inspiring! I want to loudly applaud this promotion in Shanxi Province, and I must also promote it more, eat it more, and if I am sent to the countryside, I may also plant more of it.
    Perhaps you think I am from Shanxi? No. Or that I particularly love eating potatoes or other tubers? Not necessarily. However, I do find them quite delicious, especially when the capable cook comrades turn them into various dishes; they can truly be called excellent in color, aroma, and taste. I also checked the "Food Composition Table" and found that they are rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and various nutrients that are extremely important to the human body, and the heat they produce is also very high, not inferior to most grains. I have also heard that they: 1. Have high yields. Potatoes in Shanxi usually yield 2,000 jin per mu, and up to 10,000 jin or more; sweet potatoes in Hunan yield 1,200 jin per mu, and up to 50,000 jin or more; ginger taro in Yunnan (also a type of tuber) yields 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, and up to 20,000 jin or more... I won't list them all, but in short, the yields are several times to dozens of times higher than many grains. 2. Are versatile. They can be eaten by people, pigs, and cattle, and can be used to make flour, sugar, wine...
    Their advantages are so numerous that I always feel sorry for them every time I eat them. Sometimes, when I hear someone scolding "potato," using it as a derogatory term to describe someone as unsophisticated and worthless, I feel even more injustice. I really don't understand why so many people have always looked down on these types of food.
    Some say it's "habit," and I think so too. But I say there are many bad elements in this habit, and it also carries some arrogance and delicacy. Because I later finally understood that our working people have always eaten all kinds of grains, "Rice, millet, millet, wheat, sorghum, beans, these six grains, are what people eat" (Three Character Classic), including the high-yield crop Job's tears (medicinal corn) that has been buried for thousands of years and is now being rediscovered. Until now, I have never seen working people, especially farmers, dislike this or that grain. For them, there is no distinction between coarse grains and staple grains; they eat whatever they have, all of which is the crystallization of labor, all of which is eaten with relish, and all are staple grains. Only those pampered emperors, officials, landlords, nobles, and later capitalists, young masters, fake foreign devils, and other figures disdain to eat these "lowly" foods. Firstly, they嫌them for being cheap and not as delicious as rice and white flour, and secondly, their intestines are too delicate, and they don't work and can't digest them. In the old days, most people followed the lead of the nobles, imitated each other, and gradually formed this trend, this habit.
    However, even now, some people stubbornly cling to the concept of "rice in the south and wheat in the north," emphasizing that they "are not used to eating" or "have a poor appetite," as if only rice and white flour are orthodox. They eat rice and white flour every day without any complaints, but if they are served a few meals of coarse grains or tubers, they will run out. Where to? Restaurants. Later, after being sent to the countryside, returning from labor, they smell the aroma of boiled sweet potatoes from afar and take a deep breath. When they get it in their hands, they eat it in big bites, praising it as delicious; while carefully examining it, they wonder if this sweet potato was planted by them. So, the more they eat, the more fragrant it becomes, and they are surprised at how delicate they were before. It can be seen that "not used to eating" and "poor appetite" are not immutable. Labor will make us understand everything!
    I don't think it will cause misunderstanding to say that advocating planting and eating more coarse grains is to belittle rice and wheat, or that we should not eat rice and wheat at all. No, the quality of rice and wheat still exceeds some grains in many aspects, and we should continue to increase the yield per unit area and make them one of our staple foods. But we must also expand the variety of staple foods and enrich the treasure house of grain. We will plant more of whatever crop has a high yield, great use, is nutritious, and tastes good. We don't want to maintain that old habit; we can get used to eating it, and our stomachs are very strong!

    平起平坐
    周成
    见3月4日人民日报刊载：山西省正在大力提倡“把薯类由副食品变为主粮”，“让山药蛋和粮食平起平坐”。想不到它们也有扬眉吐气的今日，这真令人振奋！我要给山西省的这个提倡大声喝采，还一定要多宣传，多吃，如果下放，还可能多种。
    也许以为我是山西人吧？不是。或者我特别爱吃山药蛋或其他薯类？也不见得。不过我确是发现它们还好吃，尤其当那能干的炊事员同志把它们做成各式饭食的时候，可真称得起色、香、味三者都佳。我又去查了下“食物成分表”，原来它们富有醣类、蛋白质以及对人体极为重要的各种营养料，产生的热量也很高，比起大部分的粮种来，都并不逊色。我还听说它们：一、产量高。山药蛋在山西平常亩产二千斤，高的在万斤以上；红薯在湖南亩产一千二百斤，高的亩产五万斤以上；云南的姜芋（也是薯类的一种）亩产四、五千斤，高的亩产两万斤以上；……不一一例举了，总之比许多粮种的产量都要高出几倍到几十倍。二、万能。可以人吃、猪吃、牛吃，可以造粉、造糖、造酒……。
    它们的优点如此众多，因此我每次吃到，总要替他们抱屈。有时候听到一声骂“山药蛋”，那是比喻这人土头土脑、价值不大的贬辞，就更觉不平了。真不理解，为什么许多人一向看不起这类食物？
    有人说这是“习惯”，我想也是。但我说这习惯里坏的成分多，还带着些儿骄气和娇气。因为我后来终于明白了我国劳动人民从来是各种粮食都吃的，“稻粱粟，麦黍稷，此六谷，人所食”（三字经），包括那埋没了千百年如今又重被发现的高产作物芣苡（药玉米）在内。直到现在，也没见劳动人民、特别是农民们，曾嫌弃过这种或那种粮食的。在他们，根本不分什么杂粮主粮，有啥吃啥，统统是劳动的结晶，统统吃得津津有味，都是主粮。只有那养尊处优的帝王官僚、地主贵族，以及后来的资本家、阔少小姐、假洋鬼子等等人物，才不屑去吃这类“低贱”食物。一则嫌它们价钱便宜，也没有大米白面可口，二则肠子绝细，又不劳动，消化不了。旧时代的人，大多唯贵人的马首是瞻，相效相传，渐渐地就形成了这种风气，这种习惯。
    然而现在，还有人牢牢咬住“南米北麦”的观念不放，强调“吃不惯”，或是“胃口不好”，总似乎只有大米白面才算正统。平时天天大米白面，没有意见，若是搭几顿杂粮、薯类食物，就要往外跑。上哪儿？馆子。后来一下放，劳动归去，老远闻到煮白薯香味，就先深呼吸一阵。拿到手里，一面大口吃着，好吃好吃，赞不绝口；一面仔细端详，这块白薯，怕还是我种的吧。于是越吃越香，诧异从前怎么那末娇气。可见，“吃不惯”、“胃口不好”，不是一成不变的。劳动会使我们懂得一切！
    我想不会引起误会，说提倡多种、多吃杂粮，就是贬低米、麦，或者都不要去吃米、麦了。不，米、麦的质量有很多方面还是超过某些粮种的，而且应该继续提高单位面积产量，仍然成为我们的主粮之一。但是我们还要扩大主粮的品种，丰富粮食的宝库。哪种作物产量高、用处大、有营养、又好吃，我们就多种它。我们不想保持那陈旧的习气，我们吃得惯，我们的肠胃强健得很！
