Newspapers Must Leap Forward
Shanxi Daily Issues a Challenge

	The "News Front" (March issue) published on the 20th carries the challenge letter issued by Shanxi Daily to provincial newspapers across the country. The challenge letter puts forward ten leap forward goals as conditions to launch a socialist grand competition with provincial newspapers across the country. The "News Front" editor's note believes that this is a very meaningful initiative for journalists in the Great Leap Forward and hopes that provincial newspapers across the country will respond to the challenge.

    报纸要跃进
    山西日报提出挑战书
    20日出版的“新闻战线”（3月号）刊载了山西日报向全国省报发出的挑战书。挑战书提出了十项跃进目标作为条件，同全国省报开展社会主义大竞赛。“新闻战线”的编者按语认为这是新闻工作者在大跃进中一项极有意义的倡议，希望全国省报群起应战。
