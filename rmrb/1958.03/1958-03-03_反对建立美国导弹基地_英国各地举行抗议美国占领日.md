Xinhua News Agency, London, March 1st. Today is "National Anti-American Occupation Day." The British people held grand demonstrations across the country to oppose the establishment of American missile bases in Britain.

	On this day, tens of thousands of people, organized by the Communist Party of Great Britain, marched towards American air force bases across the country, demanding: "No American rockets allowed here, planes carrying hydrogen bombs must stop patrolling, American bases must be dismantled immediately." The largest demonstration was held in Ruislip, near London, the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Air Command in Britain.

	As some American cars carrying some Americans drove by, the demonstrators shouted in unison, "Go home, Yankees!"

	The British authorities dispatched a large number of police cars and police officers to the areas where demonstrators were concentrated, including police vans coming and going.

	The most impressive scene was in front of the heavily guarded gate of the U.S. military headquarters. The demonstrators shouted slogans and sang: "Send the Yankee bombs home, we want peace!" "No rocket bases here, we want peace!"

	About six thousand people demonstrated in front of the headquarters, at least half of whom were women and elderly people with children, including disabled people in wheelchairs. Leaders of the Communist Party of Great Britain participated in the long demonstration.

	Not a single American soldier in uniform could be seen in front of the headquarters. Representatives sent by the marchers to meet with American officers were rejected by the headquarters. The demonstrators held a mass meeting in the courtyard of a school opposite the headquarters. John Gollan, General Secretary of the Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He announced that similar demonstrations were also being held simultaneously in Lancashire, Yorkshire, East Anglia, Gloucestershire, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Rhondda in South Wales.

	Gollan said that today's demonstration was not only against the policies of Dulles and Eisenhower, but also against the Conservative government's policy of selling Britain out to the United States. He said that while the Conservative government verbally said it wanted to hold a summit meeting, on the other hand, it was increasing its hydrogen bomb reserves and openly declaring that they intended to use hydrogen bombs against the Soviet Union in the event of war.

	Gollan called on British Communists and Labour Party members to unite all forces to fight against war, and to use the following program as the basis for joint action: no missile bases allowed in Britain; break with the Conservative Party's nuclear war policy; immediately ban further nuclear weapons tests; immediately hold summit talks to destroy all nuclear weapons; support the establishment of a "nuclear-free" zone in Europe and conclude a pan-European security treaty. Gollan called on the participants to advance the movement to achieve this program to a new stage, and to send as many resolutions and telegrams as possible to every member of Parliament. Gollan's speech was warmly applauded and cheered by the audience.

	John Mahon, Secretary of the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Chairman of the meeting, congratulated the success of the demonstration. He pointed out that this demonstration was only the beginning of the British people's large-scale movement against American occupation, and that this movement would continue until the American troops withdrew.

    反对建立美国导弹基地
    英国各地举行抗议美国占领日
    据新华社伦敦1日电　今天是“全国抗议美国占领日”。英国人民在全国各地举行了盛大的示威游行，反对美国在英国建立导弹基地。
    在这一天，由英国共产党组织起来的成千上万群众向全国各地的美国空军基地挺进，他们要求：“这里不准美国设置火箭，载有氢弹的飞机停止巡逻，立即撤销美国基地”。最盛大的游行示威是在美国驻英国战略空军司令部所在地、伦敦附近的鲁斯里普举行的。
    一些美国汽车载着一些美国人驶过时，示威群众不约而同地喊道：“回去吧，美国佬！”
    英国当局派了大量的警车和警察到示威群众集中的地方，其中还有来来往往的警察局的囚车。
    给人印象最深的场面是在警备森严的美军司令部的大门前。游行群众在那里高呼口号并且歌唱：“把美国佬的炸弹打发回家吧，我们要和平！”“不准在这里建立火箭基地，我们要和平！”
    在司令部门前示威的人约有六千人，至少有一半是带着孩子的妇女和老人，包括坐在车椅上的残废者。英国共产党的领袖们参加了长长的示威行列。
    在司令部门口，一个穿军服的美国军人也看不到。游行队伍派去见美国军官的代表们遭到司令部的拒绝。示威者在司令部对面的一个学校的院子里举行了群众大会。共产党总书记约翰·高兰在会上讲了话。他宣布，在兰开夏、约克郡、英吉利东部、格罗斯特郡、格拉斯哥、亚伯丁和南威尔士的隆达也在同时举行同样的示威。
    高兰说，这一天的示威不仅反对杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的政策，而且也反对保守党政府把英国出卖给美国的政策。他说，保守党政府一方面口头上说要举行最高级会议，但是另一方面却在增加氢弹储备并且公开宣布他们打算在战争时对苏联使用氢弹。
    高兰号召英国共产党员和工党党员团结一切力量为反对战争而斗争，并且以下列纲领作为共同行动的基础：不许在英国设立任何导弹基地；同保守党的核战争政策断绝关系；立即禁止今后再试验核武器；马上举行最高级会谈以销毁一切核武器；支持在欧洲建立“无原子”区，缔结全欧安全条约。高兰号召大会参加者把争取实现这个纲领的运动推进到新阶段，尽可能地把大量决议和电报寄给每一个议员。高兰的讲话受到了听众的热烈欢呼和鼓掌欢迎。
    大会主席、英国共产党伦敦区党委书记约翰·马洪在会上祝贺示威的成功。他指出，这次示威只是英国人民声势浩大的反对美国占领的运动的开始，这个运动将继续到美国军队撤走为止。
