Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th -- East China's coal mines exceeded the national plan by more than 51,000 tons of coal in February.

In the past, output would always decline during February, which includes the Spring Festival, but this year the miners broke this routine with revolutionary zeal. Immediately after the Spring Festival, the daily output of the entire region continued to rise. On the first day after the Spring Festival, the workers of Jiawang Coal Mine created a new record of 8,560 tons of daily output, completing 130% of the daily production plan.

    华东二月超产五万多吨煤
    据新华社济南4日电　华东各煤矿在2月份比国家计划超产煤炭五万一千多吨。
    以往每逢包括春节的2月份，产量总会下降，但是今年矿工们以革命干劲打破了这条常规。春节刚过，全区日产量即不断上升。贾汪煤矿的工人在春节后第一天就创造日产八千五百六十吨的新纪录，完成日产计划130％。
