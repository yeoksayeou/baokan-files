Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: The workers of the Qimen Rice Mill in Anhui Province are bringing machines to the countryside to mill rice for the farmers on the spot. Qimen County is a mountainous area. This factory divided its twenty workers into three production teams, one team stayed in the city for fixed processing, and two teams went to the countryside to move around. Eighty rural processing points were set up throughout the county, forming a "grain processing network."

There are many benefits to implementing this method. According to statistics from only five processing points, last year they processed 1.48 million jin of rice, saving farmers more than 30,000 workdays and more than 30,000 yuan in transportation costs. It also produced 68,000 jin more rice than processing with traditional mortars. In addition, 300,600 jin of feed bran were processed for farmers. The problem of insufficient processing tasks in the rice mill has also been solved.

    带机器下乡
    新华社合肥电　安徽省祁门碾米厂职工，带机器下乡为农民就地碾米。祁门县是山区。这个厂把二十个工人分成三个生产小组，一组留在城里固定加工，两组下乡流动。在全县设立了八十个农村加工点，形成一个“粮食加工网”。
    实行这一办法后好处很多。仅据五个加工点的统计，去年加工稻谷一百四十八万斤，就为农民节省三万多个劳动日，节省运费三万多元。又比土碓加工稻谷多出米六·八万斤。另外，为农民加工饲料糠三十万零六千斤。这个碾米厂原来加工任务不足的问题也得到解决。
