The main contents of this plan are: from now until June 1959, to ensure that 100% of university students in Beijing adhere to extracurricular physical exercise three to five times a week, each exercise lasting at least 45 minutes; 85% to 65% of students in each school will pass the first-level standard of the "Labor and Defense System," with 45% to 20% passing the second-level standard within the first level; to cultivate ranked athletes accounting for 20% of the total number of university students in Beijing; to ensure that 100% of university students in Beijing regularly participate in morning exercises or between-class exercises.
    This plan inspired more than 6,000 activists present at the meeting. An extremely warm atmosphere appeared at the meeting. Various schools challenged and accepted challenges from each other. This conference will greatly promote the leap forward in sports activities in Beijing.

    体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠、北京市体委主任张青季、共青团北京市委书记王照华都在会上讲了话，他们勉励首都各高等学校学生，要鼓起干劲，做一个体育跃进中的促进派。
