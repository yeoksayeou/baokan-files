Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, March 2nd: Romania and Hungary issued a joint statement, which was released by the Romanian and Hungarian government and party delegations regarding the results of their recent talks in Romania. The joint statement points out that, during the talks, the Romanian and Hungarian government and party delegations had unanimous views on all the issues they discussed.

On international issues, both sides firmly support the proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic regarding the unification of Germany. Both peoples urgently demand that German militarism no longer endanger the security of the European people and world peace.

In the joint statement, the Hungarian government expressed its agreement with the proposals put forward in the Romanian government's letter to the governments of the Balkan countries in September of last year, regarding strengthening cooperation between the countries in the region. It believes that this proposal not only conforms to the interests of Eastern European countries, including Hungary, but also contributes to the cause of world peace.

Both governments fully agree with the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

The statement said that the Romanian and Hungarian governments welcome the initiative of the Chinese and North Korean governments to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, believing that this initiative is an important contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, easing international tensions, and consolidating world peace.

Both governments support the Soviet government's proposal to convene a high-level meeting. Both sides believe that this proposal is in the interests of the peace and security of all nations and can pave the way for resolving complex international issues.

The statement condemned the United States' policy of strength. Both sides emphasized that, according to the will of the Romanian and Hungarian peoples, the two governments firmly oppose the US government's attempt to use the political systems of some European socialist countries as international bargaining chips. Both sides believe that this behavior by the United States is an intolerable interference in the internal affairs of our sovereign states. Both sides declared that, as long as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive bloc exists, and as long as collective security has not been realized in Europe, the two countries will continue to strengthen the Warsaw Pact organization, which defends the security, independence, and peace of socialist countries and Europe, with all their strength.

The statement, in discussing the relations between Romania and Hungary, pointed out that the cooperation between the two countries in the economic, cultural, and other fields has greatly developed since liberation. Both sides decided to continue to vigorously develop this cooperation and expressed that they would resolutely strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union by various means.

The statement, in discussing the relations between the Romanian Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, believes that the effective cooperation between the two parties is a basic guarantee for strengthening and developing the friendship between the two countries.

Both parties emphasized that the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties held in Moscow during the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution has important historical significance. The statement said that the two parties should follow Marxist-Leninist theory in all their activities. They should learn from the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other fraternal parties, and creatively apply the universal principles of Marxism-Leninism in accordance with the historical characteristics of their own nations. The two parties expressed that they would resolutely fight against revisionism and dogmatism, against the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and for consolidating the party's leading role in political, economic, and cultural life.
