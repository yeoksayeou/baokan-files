Sparrow Catching Rhyme

When the sun comes out, the mountains are red,
Sparrows are hungry and must gather;
When the sun sets and the sky darkens,
Sparrows are sleepy and must return to their nests;
Where there are chickens, there are many sparrows,
When people come, they all hide in the trees;
Once you find their habits, it's easy to strike,
Gunning and nest-raiding can eliminate them completely.

This jingle was composed by Guo Yuelai from Tongjiagou, Heshenmiao Township, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province. Based on the habits of sparrows, he has already eliminated more than 20,000 sparrows. (Attached picture)

    捕雀歌诀
    太阳出来满山红，
    麻雀肚饥要集中；
    太阳落山天快黑，
    麻雀瞌睡要回窝；
    有鸡之处麻雀多，
    人来齐往树上躲；
    找到脾气容易打，
    枪打掏窝能除净。
    这首顺口溜是山西省屯留县河神庙乡同家沟的郭月来编的。他根据麻雀的这种习性，已经消灭了两万多支麻雀。（附图片）
