    The Child's Cry
    Wang Chong
    Parents are invariably upset by the wailing of their children. But how should adults treat children who cry a lot?
    In the first few months after a child is born, their wails are a means of expressing their desires and asking adults for help. This crying is not surprising. However, if a child grows older and still frequently uses tears to achieve certain demands, becoming willful and coercing their parents, it is a bad habit. This habit is often created by the parents themselves.
    When a child cries, parents feel distressed, saying, "Good child, don't cry, what if you get sick from crying? Mommy will buy you candy, take you to the park, buy..." They use every means to satisfy the child's every request, coaxing them endlessly with sweet words. This excessive indulgence and doting makes the child spoiled, and later the child learns to use crying to achieve their demands.
    Mom took Lingling shopping. Accidentally, Lingling fell and started crying. Mom pulled up the child's pants to take a look and saw that a little skin was scraped, but there was no bleeding. However, Mom hurriedly pulled the child into a nearby joint clinic and asked the doctor to apply some mercurochrome before feeling relieved. Lingling saw her mother's nervous and hurried expression, and was also frightened pale, crying even more incessantly.
    Little Liang's mother's attitude towards her child's crying was different. When Little Liang fell and cried, Mom immediately helped him up and said in a very firm tone, "It's okay, you fell yourself, it won't hurt." She immediately shifted the topic to something else. "Little Liang! Look, a flock of white pigeons flew across the sky the other day! How beautiful!" Little Liang looked up at the flock of pigeons flying in the sky. His "pain" flew away with the pigeons flapping their wings into the distance.
    When children encounter certain unexpected accidents and start crying, parents should remain calm and observe carefully. Being alarmed or making a mountain out of a molehill will make the child timid.
    When children fall, some parents pick up the child and immediately say, "This threshold made you fall, come, kick it three times!" Although this can divert the children's attention, this approach can easily create a narrow-minded sense of revenge in the children's minds. If this feeling is brought into the group, the following often happens: if another child accidentally bumps into them, they must hit them back to be satisfied. In this way, the atmosphere of collective unity and friendship is destroyed.
    Some parents, in order to stop their child from crying, use terrible words like ghosts and monsters to scare the child. "If you cry again, the big bad wolf will come"... These words may suddenly stop the child's crying, but what follows is a greater cry of fright. The result of doing so will also make the child timid.
    Crying is often a signal of internal or physical pain for children. Children will naturally cry when they fall; children will often cry when they are hungry; poor indoor air circulation often causes children to be upset; children will certainly cry when they are sick. In these situations, adults should deal with them patiently and find out the cause of the pain.
    In many cases, children's crying is not because of pain, but to move soft-hearted parents. This kind of crying is making a fuss over nothing, deliberately acting spoiled.
    Rongrong's grandmother is an experienced home educator. When she encounters her granddaughter being emotional, she often ignores her. If the child has already started crying, using tears to coerce adults, then let her cry for a while. After a while, the grandmother will go and care for her granddaughter, and just say a few words to calm the child's emotions. The key here is not to mention the crying just now and not to casually hurt the child's self-esteem.

    孩子的哭
    王重
    做父母的，没有听到孩子们的嚎哭而不心烦意乱的。但是，大人应该怎样对待爱哭的孩子呢？
    孩子刚生下来的头几个月，哇哇的哭声，是他们表达自己的愿望和要求大人帮助的一种手段。这哭，是不足为奇的。但是，如果孩子长大了，还经常用眼泪来达到某种要求，任性和要挟父母，就是一种不好的习性了。这种习性常常是由父母自己造成的。
    孩子一哭，大人就心痛起来了，“好孩子，别哭了，哭病了怎么办？妈妈给你买糖，带你去公园，买……”他们不择手段地满足孩子的一切要求，甜言蜜语地哄个不止。这种过分迁就和溺爱的做法，使孩子娇生惯养起来，以后孩子就学会了用哭来达到自己的要求。
    妈妈带着玲玲上街买东西。不小心，玲玲摔了一跤，哭起来了。妈妈把孩子的裤子拉开一看，碰伤了一点皮，并没有流血。但是，妈妈还是匆匆忙忙地把孩子拉进附近的联合诊所，请求医生擦了一点红药水才放心下来。玲玲看了妈妈紧张忙迫的神色，也吓得脸色发白，更哭个不休。
    小良的妈妈对待孩子哭的态度就不同了。小良跌倒了，哭起来，妈妈立刻扶起他来，用十分坚定的口气说：“不要紧，自己跌倒的，不会痛。”立刻就把话题转到别的地方去了。“小良！你看，那天上飞过一群白鸽子呢！多好看呀！”小良抬起头来看着天空中飞翔的一群白鸽子。“痛苦”也随着鸽子的振翼高飞而飞到天外去了。
    孩子们遇到某些意外的事故而哭泣起来，做父母的应该镇静，细心的观察。大惊小怪或者小题大做都会使孩子变得怯懦起来。
    孩子们跌倒的时候，也有的父母亲抱起孩子以后立刻对孩子说：“这门槛使你跌倒的，来，踢它三下！”这样做虽然能做到转移孩子们的注意力。然而，这种做法容易使孩子们的思想上产生狭隘的报复心理。这种感情带到集体中去，往往会发生这种事：别的孩子无意把自己碰倒了，也要打他一下才满足。这样，集体的团结友爱气氛就被破坏了。
    有些父母为了制止孩子的哭，用神鬼妖怪等可怕的话恐吓孩子。“再哭，大灰狼来了”……这些话，可能会使孩子忽然停止了哭声，但紧接着是受惊后更大的哭喊。这样做的结果也会使孩子变得怯懦。
    哭，往往是孩子们内心痛苦或肉体痛苦的一种信号。孩子们摔倒了自然会哭；孩子们饿了也往往会哭；室内空气不流通，也常常引起儿童心烦；孩子们有病了，当然会啼哭起来。这些情况，大人们都应当耐心处理。把引起痛苦的原因找出来。
    有许多场合，孩子们的哭并不是因为痛苦，而是为了打动软心的父母。这种哭是小题大做，故意撒娇。
    蓉蓉的祖母是位有经验的家庭教育家。她遇到孙女儿闹情绪时，往往不去理睬，孩子已经哭起来了，开始用眼泪来要挟大人，那就让他哭一阵子。过一会儿，祖母再去关照孙女儿，只要随便说几句话，就把孩子的情绪安定下来了。这里的关键便是不要再提起刚才啼哭的事。不要随便伤害孩子的自尊心。
