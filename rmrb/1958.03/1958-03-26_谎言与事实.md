    Lies and Facts

    In his speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 24th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles tried his best to beautify America's "foreign aid" policy. He described the purpose of "U.S. aid" as helping recipient countries "regain greater freedom and independence" and that it stemmed from "humanitarian considerations." It seemed that the United States had no selfish motives in implementing its "foreign aid" policy and was being extremely benevolent.

    However, at the same meeting, Dulles slapped himself in the face. Under questioning from senators, he was forced to admit that more than three-quarters of "U.S. aid" funds were spent in the United States, and the remaining less than one-quarter, although given to recipient countries, would quickly return to the United States to purchase American industrial and agricultural products. For the United States, "the effect is to combat economic recession." In the past, U.S. officials had admitted that "U.S. aid" was exporting crisis, but nothing was more blatant than Dulles' own admission. It turns out that Dulles' initial talk of "humanitarian considerations" and making recipient countries "free and independent" were nothing but lies; it was the big American capitalists who benefited from "U.S. aid."

    谎言与事实
    美国国务卿杜勒斯24日在参议院外交委员会发表的演说中，竭力为美国的“援外”政策涂脂抹粉。他把“美援”的目的，说成是帮助受援国“重新取得更大的自由和独立”，是从“人道的考虑”出发的。似乎美国实行“援外”政策没有一点私心，是最仁慈不过的了。
    可是，就在同一个会上，杜勒斯却自己打了自己的嘴巴。他在参议员们的质询下，不得不被迫承认，“美援”四分之三以上的款项是在美国花掉的，其余不足四分之一虽然交给受援国家，也很快就会回到美国去购买美国的工农产品，这对美国说来，“其效果是对付经济衰退”。过去美国官员虽然承认过“美援”就是输出危机，却再没有比杜勒斯亲口说的这样更露骨的了。原来，杜勒斯起先说的什么“人道的考虑”、使受援国家“自由和独立”等等，只不过是谎话；得到“美援”好处的，是美国的大资本家。
