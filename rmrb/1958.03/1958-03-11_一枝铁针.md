    A Knitting Needle
    Yin Jindi

    Since coming to the countryside, a knitting needle for making gloves has been added to my belongings. Recently, this knitting needle has been causing great changes in the hearts of the girls in the Longxi Cooperative Fourth Team of the Shanghai West Suburbs District.

    When I first arrived here, what caught my attention the most was this knitting needle. After field labor, I would always see the girls dealing with the knitting needle. No matter where they went, they always liked to hold this needle in their hands. One day, I had just returned home when Xiufang from next door came with a small basket. Then she took a small, delicate needle from the basket. The tip of the needle was shiny, about the length of a pen, and the needle shaft was covered with a bamboo sheath. She wrapped white thread around the needle hook, and her hand started to sway. Dida, dida... it made a sound like a clock. The shape of a glove also appeared in Xiufang's hand, with delicate and beautiful patterns carved on it.

    "Such beautiful gloves! Who are they for?" To be honest, I had never seen such beautiful gloves made of thread. Because I heard that Xiufang was getting married soon, I assumed she was making gloves for her wedding. Unexpectedly, Shiling, the little sister living in my house, burst out laughing, and then she also started knitting. Later, I learned that knitting gloves was a sideline production here, and all the girls here knew this craft. They could knit all kinds of patterns: osmanthus patterns, barley patterns, ear patterns... there were more than twenty kinds of patterns. These gloves are for export, specially for foreigners to wear at banquets and social gatherings. The girls knit these gloves as processing work. For a pair of gloves, they can get a processing fee of 50 cents, and the difficult patterns cost 66 cents per pair. It is said that those who knit quickly can complete one and a half pairs a day. However, in order to ensure agricultural production, the girls do this work in their spare time. Even so, each person can knit three pairs a week! There is also such a rule here: the money earned by the girls from knitting gloves is their own private property. They use this extra income to make clothes, buy woolen sweaters, knit beautiful woolen scarves… Xu Xiufang and Zhang Xiaomei, who are getting married during the Spring Festival, have been knitting particularly hard recently.

    Every day after work at 4:30 pm, it is the best time for the girls to knit gloves. Every day, I watch the girls knit, and I can't help but feel itchy: "Coming to the countryside, in addition to learning how to do farm work, it would also be very interesting to learn this craft!" I decided to go to the blacksmith shop to buy such a knitting needle and learn this glove-knitting craft from the sisters here.

    As soon as the knitting needle was bought, the situation changed. At 4:30, the whistle for the end of work echoed in the fields as usual. However, none of the girls in the fields wanted to go home to get the knitting needle. Instead, they carried hoes and ran to the farther riverbank and roadside. They were energetically weeding to fertilize the land in order to achieve the production targets for 1958! It turned out that the girls had all joined the youth fertilizer accumulation shock team.

    It was a cold night, and the Communist Youth League members of the Fourth Team gathered in the team's office, listening to the branch committee member conveying the spirit of the township's meeting of production activists: "The biggest difficulty now is the lack of fertilizer. Can our youth take the lead and organize a youth fertilizer accumulation shock team, taking out an hour after work to accumulate fertilizer voluntarily and contribute it to the cooperative, is that okay?"

    "This is a good idea, I'll sign up!" "I agree!" Several young men quickly signed up. However, the girls were silent, their faces flushed red. Should they participate or not? If they participate! They would knit fewer gloves, and knitting fewer gloves would mean reducing personal income. If they don't participate! Accumulating fertilizer is a good thing, and the Communist Youth League should take the lead in doing it. At this time, a young woman spoke up. She said that if the fertilizer is prepared adequately now, and a bumper harvest comes this year, isn't this knitting more gloves for the cooperative? Besides, taking out an hour after work won't reduce the number of gloves knitted by much, but if the fertilizer accumulated by adding up everyone's hour is added together, this power cannot be underestimated!

    After she said this, the girls' minds seemed to be enlightened. Seventeen League members and youths signed up at once, even Xiufang and Xiaomei, who were getting married during the Spring Festival, also participated. Since then, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday afternoon, after work, the youth fertilizer accumulation shock team members forgot their fatigue, forgot the knitting needles, and rushed to the fields. They continued until the sun set and twilight descended, and everyone happily put the hoed grass fertilizer into baskets and carried them home.

    Although I haven't yet learned how to knit gloves very well. However, every time I touch this knitting needle, I seem to feel it more intimate. In the past, I only knew that the girls loved the knitting needle, but now, I know even more that the girls love the cooperative even more, and they love socialism even more.

    一枝铁针
    殷金娣
    下乡以后，在我的家具里头，增加了一支织手套的铁针。最近，这支铁针在上海西郊区陇西社四队姑娘们的心里，起着很大的变化。
    在我刚到这里的时候，最引起我注意的就是这支铁针。每当田间劳动结束以后，总是看到姑娘们在和铁针打交道，她们不论到那儿，手里总喜欢拿着这支针。有一天，我刚回到家里，隔壁秀芳提了一只小篮子来了，接着她从篮子里取出一支小巧的针，针尖发亮，有笔杆这样长，针杆上套着竹套，她将白线绕在针钩上，手就摇摆起来了。的答、的答……发出像钟表一样的声音。秀芳的手里也出现了手套的形状，上面还刻着精细美丽的花纹。
    “这样好看的手套！给谁打的”。说真的，我从未看到过用线打的这样漂亮的手套。因为我听说秀芳不久就要出嫁了，满以为她一定是打结婚用的手套。没有想到，我住家的小妹妹世玲噗哧一声笑起来了，接着她也打起来了。以后我才了解，打手套是这里的副业生产，这里的姑娘们都会这种手艺。她们能打出各式各样的花样：什么桂花通、大麦通、耳朵通……等等花样，就有二十多种。这种手套是出口的，专供外国人出席宴会、联欢会用的。姑娘们打这种手套是加工的，一副手套，就可以拿五角钱加工费，难打的花式每副要六角六分钱。据说打得快的人一天就可以完成一副半。但是，姑娘们为了保证农业生产，把这个活儿都放在业余的时间来做。就是这样，每人一星期内可以打三副呢！这里还有这样一个规矩：姑娘们打手套挣来的钱，都是归自己私有的，她们将这种额外的收入用来做衣服、买毛线衣、打漂亮的毛线围巾……到春节就要结婚的许秀芳、张小妹等，最近打得特别勤快。
    每天下午四点半放工以后，是姑娘们打手套的最好的时光。每天，我都看着姑娘们打，不觉心痒起来：“到农村里来，除了学会干农活以外，还能够学会这种手艺倒也很有意思！”我决定到铁匠铺里去买这样的一支铁针，向这里的姊妹学习这种打手套的手艺。
    铁针刚买来，情况却起了变化。四点半到了，放工的哨子声照例地在田野里回响着。可是，在田里的姑娘没有一个想回家拿铁针，而是扛着锄头，奔向更远的小河边、小路旁。她们为着实现1958年的生产指标，在起劲地锄草肥呢！原来，姑娘们都参加了青年积肥突击队了。
    那是一个寒冷的夜晚，四队的共青团员们集合在队的办公室里，听着团分支委员在传达乡生产积极分子会议的精神：“现在最大的困难是缺乏肥料，我们青年能不能带个头，组织个青年积肥突击队，劳动完了，抽出一小时，义务搞积肥，贡献给社，好不好？”
    “这个办法好，我报名！”“我赞成！”几个男青年很快地就报了名。可是，姑娘们一声不响，脸孔涨得通红。参加呢还是不参加呢？参加吧！手套眼看就要少打了，少打手套，就是减少个人收入，不参加吧！积肥是件好事，共青团应该带头做。正在这个时候，有位女青年发言了，她说要是现在肥料准备得充足，今年来个大丰收，这不是为社多打了更多的手套吗？何况，放工以后抽一小时，手套也少打不了多少，但是如果把每个人的一小时加起来积肥，这份力量就不可小看啦！
    给她这样一说，姑娘们的心都好像开了窍似的，一下有十七个团员和青年报了名，连春节就要结婚的秀芳、小妹等也参加了。以后，每逢星期二、四、六下午，放工以后，青年积肥突击队员们就忘记疲劳、忘记了铁针、奔向田野。一直等到夕阳下山，暮色降临，大家才愉快地将锄的草肥装进篓内，扛着回家去了。
    我虽然还没有很好地学会打手套。可是，每当我摸到这支铁针的时候，我似乎觉得它更亲切了。我过去只知道姑娘们爱铁针，现在，我更知道姑娘们更爱合作社，更爱社会主义。
