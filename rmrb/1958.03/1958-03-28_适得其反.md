Notes

    Backfires
    At a press conference on March 26, U.S. President Eisenhower said that the United States would invite foreign observers, perhaps including Soviets, to observe the U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific this summer, and also hoped that the United Nations would appoint a "scientific committee" to investigate atomic radiation results as an observation group.
    This is a trick that Eisenhower played when the movement against the U.S. nuclear tests on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific Ocean was rising higher and higher among the people of the world. His intention is nothing more than to divert people's attention, ease the tide of protests from people of all countries against the U.S. nuclear tests on the high seas, and flaunt its "nuclear deterrent."
    However, Eisenhower's approach will not only deceive people, but will also backfire. The people of all countries will respond to Eisenhower's deception with even more resolute protests.

    适得其反
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在3月26日的记者招待会上说，美国将邀请外国观察员，也许包括苏联人在内，来参观美国今年夏天在太平洋进行的核试验，还希望联合国指派一个调查原子放射结果的“科学委员会”作为见证小组。
    这是艾森豪威尔在全世界人民反对美国在太平洋恩纳威托克岛进行核试验的运动越来越高涨的时候所耍的花招。他的用意无非是想借此转移人们的视线，缓和各国人民反对美国在公海上进行核试验的抗议怒潮，并炫耀其“核威慑力量”罢了。
    但是，艾森豪威尔的这种手法不但骗不了人，而且会适得其反，各国人民将会以更加坚决的抗议来回答艾森豪威尔的这种骗局。
