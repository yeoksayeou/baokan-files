In the Great Leap Forward, more labor models and advanced individuals have emerged, and advanced deeds and experiences continue to appear. New models surpass the old, and new targets break through the old, which is truly encouraging. However, some people feel differently. They feel it is a pity that the original models are surpassed by newcomers. In their view, since they are models, they should never be surpassed. The "banner" should of course always be at the forefront. Therefore, they are not enthusiastic about the emergence of new people. Instead, they sigh that the original models have been surpassed, saying that what was once a great sensation will soon become silent and invisible. Therefore, they lament: "The waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves, and new people in the world surpass the old!"

It is naturally not a mistake to want the models to always be at the forefront, but this view is not realistic and does not conform to the laws of life. Everyone is familiar with a few slogans: "The advanced lead the backward, the backward catch up with the advanced; help each other and improve together." Labor models are advanced figures among the people. They are respected by the people because they drive people forward with their advanced thinking and creativity. However, things do not stand still. In our socialist country, in this era of heroic figures, everyone is exerting revolutionary vigor, comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. As a result, the advanced will inevitably be caught up and surpassed.

Moreover, the model being surpassed by new figures is also a good thing for the model itself. First, these newcomers are able to surpass them because they are advancing on the conditions created by the models. The new indicators and new methods pioneered by the models are the foundation for the newcomers to surpass them. Therefore, the new achievements of the newcomers include the merits of the models. Second, the new achievements of the newcomers, in turn, create conditions for the models to surpass these newcomers again in the future. Since these newcomers can learn from their strengths, develop them, and create to surpass them, why can't the models learn from the strengths of these newcomers, develop them, and create to surpass these newcomers again? In our society, we learn from each other and progress together in this way. The so-called "mutual promotion" is the same principle. In this way, the waves follow the waves, each wave higher than the last, and our society will progress and our construction will advance by leaps and bounds. It is difficult to imagine that without the continuous emergence of new forces, relying only on the original few banners and figures, socialism can be built. "In Shu there are no great generals, Liao Hua acts as the vanguard" is ultimately not a good phenomenon. What we want is "brave generals like clouds, wise advisors like rain," one generation surpassing another, rather than maintaining the status quo!

I think that labor models will never be discouraged because they have been surpassed by others, otherwise they would not be worthy of being called models; they will rise up and strive to contribute more to socialism. They will be like Zhao Zilong, who galloped across Changban Slope in his youth, wielding his spear and fighting in the midst of a million soldiers as if in an uninhabited place, and who could still "forcefully cut down five generals" in his old age. In dealing with new forces, they can also be like Zhao Zilong's attitude towards Jiang Wei, praising "good spearmanship," rather than harboring jealousy.

"The spirit can be boosted but not deflated," and "new people in the world surpass the old" is a great thing, and there is no need to "lament" anything at all.

    新人胜旧人
    曾田家
    在全民大跃进中，劳动模范和先进人物更多地涌现了，先进事迹和先进经验不断出现，新的模范赶过了原来的模范，新的指标突破了旧的指标，真令人欢欣鼓舞。然而有些人的心情却与众不同，他们觉得原有的模范被新人超过非常可惜。在他们看来，既然是模范嘛，就应该永远不被人赶上才好，“旗帜”当然应该永远走在前头的。于是，便对新人的出现，鼓不起热情，反而对原有的模范被赶过颇多叹息，说什么原来轰轰烈烈，转眼就会无声无息。因此，他们叹息道：“长江后浪推前浪，世上新人胜旧人”！
    愿意模范永远走在前头，自然也不算是什么错误，然而这种看法却并不现实，也不合乎生活的规律。有几句口号大家都是听熟了的：“先进带动落后，落后赶上先进；互相帮助，共同提高”。劳动模范是人民中的先进人物，他们以自己的先进思想和创造带动人们前进，因此受到人们的尊敬。但是事物不是停止不前的，在我们社会主义国家里，在这英雄辈出的时代，大家都在发挥革命干劲，在比先进、学先进、赶先进，结果先进必然会被赶上，被超过。
    何况模范被新的人物赶过，对于模范本身也是一件好事，一则这些新人之所以能够赶过他们，首先就是因为这些新人是在他们所创造的条件上前进的，他们所首创的新指标新方法，便是新人赶过他们的基础，因此在新人的新成就里就包含有他们的功绩；二则新人的新成就，又反过来给他们以后再赶过这些新人创造了条件。既然这些新人能够学习他们长处加以发挥创造赶过他们，那末，他们为什么又不能去学习这些新人的长处，加以发挥创造再赶过这些新人呢？在我们这个社会里，我们正是这样彼此学习，彼此进步的，所说的“互相促进”也就是这道理。就这样后浪推前浪，一浪高一浪，我们的社会才会进步，我们的建设才会突飞猛进。很难设想，没有新生力量的不断出现，只依靠原有的几面旗帜，几个人物，就能把社会主义建成。“蜀中无大将，廖化作先锋”终归不是好现象。我们要求的应该是“猛将如云，谋臣如雨”，一代胜过一代，而不是维持现状！
    我想，劳动模范决不会因为被别人赶过了而灰心丧气，否则他们便也称不起是模范；他们会奋起直追，为社会主义更多地贡献力量。他们会像赵子龙一样，年轻时在长板坡跃马横枪在百万军中如入无人之境，在年老时也能“力斩五将”。在对待新生力量方面，也能像赵子龙之对待姜维，连声称赞“好枪法”，而决不是抱嫉妒的心情。
    “气可鼓而不可泄”，“世上新人胜旧人”，是一件大大的好事，根本用不着“感慨”什么的。
