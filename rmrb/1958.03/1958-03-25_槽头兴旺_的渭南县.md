    "Flourishing Troughs" in Weinan County
    By our reporters Wu Gang and Liu Bin
    "Flourishing troughs, peaceful livestock" is a couplet that Weinan farmers used to paste in their livestock pens. However, the beautiful wish of generations of individual farmers has only become a reality today, after collectivization.
    Since collectivization in Weinan County in 1955, the county leadership has seized on the new problems that have emerged in animal husbandry, vigorously mobilized the masses to adopt a series of effective measures, and the agricultural cooperatives' livestock have achieved bumper harvests for two consecutive years, realizing and exceeding the target set by the Ministry of Agriculture a year ahead of schedule, which required that each 100 breeding female animals should breed 35-40 live young animals this year. Now, the county has many breeding female animals, young animals, and strong animals, and few old and weak animals, fundamentally changing the face of the livestock population.
    Grasping the Problem and Finding Solutions
    In the early stage of agricultural collectivization, the contradiction between the expansion of production and the shortage of animal power was very obvious in Weinan. The newly established agricultural cooperatives experienced a temporary phenomenon of livestock becoming thin and weak, which made this contradiction even more prominent.
    What were the reasons for the livestock being thin and weak, and how to solve the difficulty of insufficient animal power? The leaders of Weinan County immediately went deep among the masses to investigate and research. The masses reflected: "The cattle are thin (public), the pigs are fat (private), the cattle are complaining, the horses are crying, the feeders are stealing feed, and the cooperative cadres are sleeping!" This truly revealed the reasons for the livestock being thin and weak. This was entirely a matter of ideology and work. The contradiction between the individual interests of the cooperative members and the collective interests was the basic reason for the livestock being thin and weak. The private ownership mentality of individual farmers who had just joined the cooperative was not compatible with the newly established collective ownership system.
    Since Weinan County found the reasons for the livestock being thin and weak, it also found the way to solve the problem. Therefore, they decided to strengthen leadership and resolutely rely on the masses to reverse the situation of livestock being thin and weak, and proposed striving to achieve self-raising, self-breeding, and self-use of livestock in agricultural cooperatives.
    Weinan County held a special discussion on livestock issues at the county's three-level cadre meeting. The discussion criticized the erroneous ideas that livestock had no future for development and waiting for tractors, etc. Then, a long-term plan for the comprehensive development of animal husbandry and an annual implementation plan were formulated, proposing the fighting goals of "cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses forming large herds, pigs and dairy goats filling the pens, and chickens, geese, and ducks forming flocks" and "the average area of arable land borne by each draft animal gradually reduced to 25 mu."
    Weinan County also adopted the method of assigning special personnel to be responsible and implementing it at all levels, with county cadres in charge of areas, township cadres in charge of cooperatives, cooperative cadres in charge of teams, and Party and Youth League members in charge of troughs. Necessary organizations were also established. From the county and township to the cooperative, one cadre was assigned to be in charge of animal husbandry work; agricultural cooperatives established animal husbandry shares. At the same time, a bottom-up reporting and research system was established. In addition, under the unified leadership of the Party, cooperation and collaboration among various relevant parties were strengthened.
    The leadership of Weinan County also implemented the working method of the mass line, and according to the principle of combining the individual and the general, dispatched resident cadres to four townships one after another, moving from point to area, obtaining experience, and then promoting it to various places. They organized comparisons, with agricultural cooperatives comparing livestock once a month, townships comparing them once a season, and the entire county comparing them once a year; they also held livestock competitions and commendation and award meetings. They focused on different key issues at different times, seizing crash breeding in April and May, seizing silage corn stalks in the autumn, and seizing livestock safety over the winter; grasping the contradiction between breeding and service when breeding livestock. These are all important keys to Weinan County's success in livestock breeding.

    Carrying out a Great Debate on the Ideology of Loving Livestock
    In the spring of 1956, Weinan County launched a mass ideological debate on loving livestock (who does the cooperative belong to, who do the cattle belong to, why are the livestock thin and weak, can the livestock be raised well?) and a major inspection (whether the cooperative cadres attach importance to livestock, whether the inspection is thorough, whether problems are discovered and resolved in a timely manner); at the same time, they also calculated three accounts (what is the most valuable thing in the cooperative, the account of increased production from protecting and breeding livestock, the account of losses from not raising livestock well); they also organized feeders to "appeal for grievances for dead cattle and complain for thin cattle."
    This is an economic account and also an account of political ideology. In this ideological struggle between the two roads, the socialist consciousness and collectivist thinking of the masses were enhanced, the activities of landlords and rich peasants and capitalist forces were attacked, and the selfish individualism was criticized. During the accounting by the members of the Baidang Cooperative, they found that the livestock that were thin and died in their cooperative was equivalent to a loss of 87 yuan per household in the entire cooperative; about 500 mu of land lost power, and all the members of the cooperative had to cultivate by manpower for a month and a half; 760 cartloads of manure were lost in a year, with an average loss of 140 jin of grain per household. After this calculation, the members understood; the members realized the importance of protecting and breeding livestock, and realized the relationship between individual interests and collective interests, saying, "Without small cattle, there would be no big cattle," "Where can we buy them if no one breeds livestock! Production is also unreliable." They also said, "Before joining the cooperative, the cattle were half of the family's property, and after joining the cooperative, the cattle are half of the cooperative's property."
    Establishing a New Team of Feeders
    This was a mass ideological debate and also an acute class struggle. The broad masses of cooperative members saw in the debate that wherever people loyal to socialism served as feeders, the livestock there were well fed; wherever livestock were not well fed, either landlords, rich peasants, and other hostile elements had infiltrated the feeding room, or lazy people and idlers had become feeders. On the basis of the improved consciousness of the cooperative members, the various agricultural cooperatives in Weinan County began to rectify the ranks of feeders. They conducted feeder evaluations, rewarded a group, replaced a group, punished a group, and trained a group. Since then, more than 1,500 active elements loyal to socialism have taken up the jobs of feeders.
    Weinan County used various methods to overcome the backward ideas of looking down on feeding and breeding work, and to improve the social and political status of feeders and breeders. Leading cadres of the county personally talked with feeders and breeders, invited outstanding feeders and breeders to participate in the county People's Congress, and put the selected model feeders and breeders on the honor roll, in the seat of honor, wearing red flowers. They also set various reward systems to give reasonable rewards to cooperative members who had achievements in breeding, breeding, and feeding; set up a vacation system for feeders and gave them necessary care in life. In addition, they also delegated some flexible control, adjustment and supervision of livestock service, rest and other powers to feeders to strengthen their sense of responsibility; held training classes for feeding and breeding, and held experience exchange meetings to improve the labor skills of feeders and breeders. In this way, a new team of feeders loyal to socialism and with labor skills was formed.
    Establishing a New Set of Systems
    After the above-mentioned great debate and a series of work, the social atmosphere changed. The feeding and breeding work of agricultural cooperatives has also become a glorious socialist labor. The new social ethos of "loving the cooperative as home and loving cattle as children" has been established. A woman and Communist Party member named Yuan Jinzhen, known as "Mother of Cattle," after accepting the task from the Party branch to feed a weaned calf well, tried to feed the calf with goat milk and batter, and finally raised the calf to be large and strong. Zhang Zhonghui, a feeder of the Nantun Cooperative in Guandao Township, dug wild vegetables for the cattle to eat, and fed a cow that had been examined by a veterinarian and deemed incurable into a top-notch healthy cow.
    When the enthusiasm of the masses was mobilized, many difficulties were solved. Weinan County summarized the experience of the masses in a timely manner, made it a system of animal husbandry in agricultural cooperatives, and then promoted it to the masses. Various agricultural cooperatives also absorbed the folk's inherent experience in livestock breeding and applied it to the new conditions of collectivization to overcome the contradiction between service and breeding. According to the proverb circulating among the people that "horses and donkeys mate from the Awakening of Insects to the White Dew, and cattle mate all year round," the agricultural cooperatives established a livestock breeding system; according to the agricultural season, breeding was carried out in April and May before the summer harvest began and in November after the autumn harvest ended and when the livestock were in heat. Weinan County extracted the law of seizing the season from the scattered experiences in various places, formulated a breeding reward system, a breeding animal traveling street breeding system, and mobilized the masses to crash breed different livestock in stages and batches.
    Weinan County also summarized and promoted the "five determinations and one guarantee" system (determining work, determining feed, determining grass, determining fertilizer, determining hybridization, and guaranteeing fatness) and the advanced feeding system of "three diligences, five knowledge, and six cleanness" (diligent feeding, diligent drinking, diligent rest, knowing cold, knowing heat, knowing hunger, knowing fullness, knowing strength size, trough clean, circle clean, grass clean, feed clean, water clean, livestock body clean) created by the agricultural cooperatives, the service system and the service handover system. Through these systems, cooperation between service and feeding personnel was strengthened, and the contradictions between collective interests and individual interests, long-term interests and current interests were properly resolved, and the livestock industry of agricultural cooperatives was put on the right track.

    “槽头兴旺”的渭南县
    本报记者　吴钢　刘斌
    “槽头兴旺，六畜平安”，这是过去渭南农民贴在畜圈里的对联。然而，世世代代个体农民的这个美好愿望，只有在合作化了的今天，才变成现实。
    渭南县从1955年合作化后，县的领导抓住了畜牧上出现的新问题，大力发动群众采取一系列有效措施，农业社的牲畜连续两年获得丰产，提前一年实现并超过农业部要求今年每百头有繁殖能力的母畜应繁殖成活幼畜三十五——四十头的指标。现在，全县母畜、幼畜、壮畜多，老弱牲畜少，基本上改变了畜群的面貌。
    抓住问题也找出了解决办法
    农业合作化初期，生产扩大和畜力不足之间的矛盾，在渭南表现得非常明显。初建的农业社，牲畜一度发生了暂时的瘦乏现象，使得这个矛盾更加突出。
    牲畜瘦乏的原因何在，怎样解决畜力不足的困难呢？渭南县领导上马上深入群众调查研究。群众的反映是：“牛瘦了（公有），猪肥了（私有），牛告哩，马叫哩，饲养员偷料哩，社干不管睡觉哩！”真是一语道破了牲畜瘦乏的原因。这完全是思想问题、工作问题。社员个人利益和集体利益的矛盾，是形成牲畜瘦乏的基本原因。个体农民初入社的私有观念和新建的集体所有制不相适应。
    渭南县既然找到了牲畜瘦乏的原因，也就找到了解决问题的途径。于是，他们决定加强领导，坚决依靠群众来扭转牲畜瘦乏的局面，提出争取作到农业社牲畜自养、自繁和自用。
    渭南县在县三级干部会上，对牲畜问题作了专题讨论。讨论中批判了认为牲畜没有发展前途、等待拖拉机等等错误思想。接着又制定了全面发展畜牧业的远景规划和年度实施方案，提出“牛、驴、骡、马成大群，生猪、奶羊喂满圈，鸡、鹅、鸭养成群”和“平均每头役畜负担耕地面积逐步减少到二十五亩”的奋斗目标。
    渭南县还采取专人负责，层层贯彻的办法，县干部包片，乡干部包社，社干部包队，党、团员包槽。还建立了必要的组织，从县、乡到社，负责干部都有一人分工专管畜牧工作；农业社建立了畜牧股，同时，建立了自下而上的汇报研究制度。此外，在党的统一领导下，加强了各有关方面的配合协作。
    渭南县领导上还贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，按照个别和一般相结合的原则，先后在四个乡派出长驻干部，由点到面，取得经验后，再向各地推广。他们组织评比，农业社一月评比一次牲畜，各乡一季评比一次，全县一年评比一次；他们还召开了赛畜会、庆功颁奖会。他们在不同时期抓不同的关键问题，4、5月抓突击配种，秋天抓青贮玉米秸，冬天抓牲畜安全过冬；繁殖牲畜时抓繁殖与役使的矛盾。这些，都是渭南县取得牲畜繁殖的重要关键。进行爱畜思想大辩论
    1956年春，渭南县展开群众性的爱畜思想大辩论（社是谁的，牛是谁的，牲畜为什么瘦乏，牲畜能不能喂好？）和大检查（社干对牲畜重视不重视，检查深入不深入，发现问题解决及时不及时）；同时还算了三笔账（社里什么最值钱，保护和繁殖牲畜的增产账，喂不好牲畜的损失账）；还组织饲养员“为死牛申冤，为瘦牛诉苦。”
    这是一笔经济账，也是一笔政治思想账。在这一场两条道路的思想斗争中，提高了群众的社会主义觉悟和集体主义思想，打击了地主、富农的活动和资本主义势力，批判了自私自利的个人主义思想。白党社社员算账中，发现他们社瘦乏死亡的牲畜，等于全社每户损失了八十七元；约五百亩地失去动力，全社社员要用人力耕作一个半月；一年损失了七百六十多车畜粪，平均每户损失一百四十斤粮食。一算之后，社员心里亮了；社员们认识到保畜和繁殖牲畜的重要性，认识到个人利益同集体利益的关系，说：“没有小牛就没有大牛”、“大家都不繁殖牲畜到那里去买！生产也靠不住”。还说：“入社前牛是家里的半个家当，入社后牛就是社里的半个家当”。
    建立新的饲养员队伍
    这是一场群众性的思想大论战，也是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。广大社员都在辩论中看出，凡是那里忠于社会主义的人担任饲养员，那里的牲口便喂的好；凡是牲畜喂不好的，不是地主、富农等敌对分子钻进饲养室，便是懒汉、二流子充当了饲养员。渭南县各个农业社在社员觉悟提高的基础上，开始整顿饲养员的队伍。他们进行了饲养员评比，奖励了一批，撤换了一批，处罚了一批，训练了一批。此后，一千五百多个忠于社会主义的积极分子走上了饲养员的工作岗位。
    渭南县用种种办法，克服那些看不起饲养、配种工作的落后思想，提高饲养员、配种员的社会政治地位。县上领导干部亲自和饲养员、配种员谈话，邀请优秀的饲养员、配种员参加县人民代表大会，给评选出的模范饲养员、配种员上光荣榜，坐光荣席，披红戴花。他们还定出各种奖励制度，给配种、繁殖、饲养有成绩的社员以合理奖励；定出饲养员的休假制度，在生活上给以必要的照顾。此外，他们还下放一些支配灵活、调剂和监督牲畜役使、休息等权力给饲养员，加强其责任心；举办饲养、配种的训练班，召开经验交流会，来提高饲养员、配种员的劳动技能。这样，一支新的忠于社会主义而又有劳动技能的饲养员队伍便形成了。
    建立一套新的制度
    经过上面一场大辩论和一系列的工作，社会风气为之一变。农业社的饲养、配种工作同样成为了光荣的社会主义劳动。“爱社如家、爱牛如子”的社会新风尚树立起来。被誉为“牛娃妈”的妇女、共产党员袁金针，在接受党支部给她喂好一头断奶小牛的任务后，设法用羊奶、面糊喂小牛，终于把小牛喂大，而且很健壮。官道乡南屯社饲养员张忠惠，给牛挖野菜吃，把一头经过兽医检查，认为医治无效的牛，喂成头号健牛。
    当群众的积极性发动起来之后，许多困难也都迎刃而解。渭南县及时总结了群众经验，使之成为一套农业社畜牧业的制度，再推广到群众中去。各个农业社还吸收了民间固有的牲畜繁殖经验，运用在合作化的新条件下，克服了役使和繁殖的矛盾。农业社根据民间流传的“马驴惊蛰至白露，常年四季都配牛”的谚语，建立了牲畜配种制度；又根据农活季节，在4、5月夏收未开始和11月秋收结束而又是牲畜发情的时候，分别进行配种。渭南县从各地零星经验中，摸出抓季节的规律，制定了繁殖奖励制度、种畜赶街巡回配种制度，发动群众对不同牲畜，分期分批突击配种。
    渭南县还总结推行了农业社创造的“五定一保”制（定工、定料、定草、定肥、定杂交、保膘）和“三勤、五知、六净”（勤喂、勤饮、勤休息，知冷、知热、知饥、知饱、知力气大小，槽净、圈净、草净、料净、水净、畜身净）的先进饲养制度，使役制度和使役交接制度。通过这些制度，加强了役使和饲养人员之间的协作，妥善解决了集体利益与个人利益、长远利益与当前利益的矛盾，使农业社的养畜业纳入正轨。
