Guizhou Daily reports: In the twenty-four days from February 8th to March 4th, peasants in Tongren County, Guizhou Province, manufactured 682 ox carts and horse carts using wood. After testing, the daily transport volume of each ox (horse) cart is approximately equal to the transport volume of twelve medium-strength laborers.

In early February, in order to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage, Tongren County planned to manufacture 6,000 ox (horse) carts this year to replace 60% of manual transport with animal power. The Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative calculated that replacing manual transport with animal power could increase the cooperative's income by 591.2 yuan per day. Therefore, the cooperative members enthusiastically went to work cutting wood to manufacture ox and horse carts. In the four days from March 1st to 4th alone, they worked overnight to produce 96 carts.

In the process of manufacturing ox and horse carts, the masses also came up with many ways to save money. For example, the axles used to be made of iron, which was both expensive and labor-intensive, taking three days and three nights to forge one axle, and costing 25 yuan just to buy the iron. After the masses found a way to replace the iron axles with hard Zelkova wood, they didn't have to spend a penny, just cut trees from the mountains and saw them into wooden axles. This Zelkova wood will not break even if it is used for one or two years, and the quality can be guaranteed. At the same time, they use wooden wheels instead of rubber wheels. The average cost of each wooden car is 70 yuan less than that of a car with iron axles and rubber wheels.

The masses were very happy to see the high transport efficiency of these ox and horse carts. Li Hulao, a 78-year-old farmer in Wawu Township, said, "My family hasn't seen these kinds of carts for generations. Now you are so lucky! This is all thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao."

While manufacturing ox and horse carts, the farmers also built 161 ox and horse cart roads, totaling 378 and a half li, overnight, in accordance with the county's spirit of "ox and horse carts going uphill and ox and horse vehicles reaching households." At present, farmers in Heping Township have built a road network throughout the township, not only connecting cooperatives and teams with ox and horse carts, but also having ox and horse cart roads from flatlands to hillsides.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 21st: In the Great Leap Forward in production, minority nationalities in Yunnan's border areas have boldly innovated technology and improved and created nearly a hundred new tools.

This year, more than two million minority people in the border areas plan to build water conservancy projects to irrigate 1.5 million mu of farmland and accumulate more than 15 billion jin of fertilizer. Such a large-scale production movement is unprecedented in the history of various minority nationalities. These nationalities have relatively backward production technology and simple tools, which cannot meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in production. For example, the Kawa, Jingpo, and Lisu ethnic groups have not used ironware for long, and livestock are generally slaughtered to "sacrifice to gods and ghosts," relying entirely on human labor for production. This situation has prompted people of all ethnic groups to carry out a revolution in production technology. In the large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, there was a lack of transportation tools, and some people wanted to utilize a large number of idle cattle and horses. Initially, when making ox carts, some Dai people did not believe that cattle would pull carts. Later, working cadres set up ox cart training grounds near the water conservancy construction site and personally taught the Dai people how to drive ox carts. Now, more than 1,000 ox carts have been manufactured throughout the prefecture to transport soil and fertilizer, increasing work efficiency nine times compared to the past when people carried it. Through continuous research and experimentation, the Dai people have also manufactured more than 900 convenient, labor-saving, and soil-filled wheelbarrows. The CPC Xishuangbanna Prefectural Committee vigorously promoted these tools, requiring each household to have a wheelbarrow and every five households to have an ox cart in the near future. In the production leap forward in Honghe County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, 27 types of tools have been improved for transportation, tamping, blasting, and surveying, and it is planned to eliminate the phenomenon of people carrying loads on their backs in one-third of the county. According to incomplete statistics, no less than a hundred kinds of tools have been created, improved, and newly used in various border areas, greatly improving the work efficiency of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. At present, more than 1 million mu of water conservancy irrigation has been completed, accounting for 70% of the plan, and nearly 7 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, accounting for 44% of the plan.

    贵州铜仁农民克服劳力不足的困难
    牛马车路上山　牛马车辆到户
    云南边疆少数民族大胆革新生产工具
    本报讯贵州日报消息：在2月8日至3月4日的二十四天中，贵州省铜仁县农民用木料制造了六百八十二部牛车和马车。经过试验，每部牛（马）车一天的运输量，约等于十二个中等劳动力的运输量。
    2月上旬，铜仁县为了克服劳力不足的困难，计划今年自制六千部牛（马）车，以畜力代替60％的人力运输。星光农业社算了一个细账，以畜力代替人力运输，一天就能为社里增加五百九十一元二角的收入。因此社员们都踊跃出工砍木料来制造牛马车。仅在3月1日至4日的四天中，便连夜赶造出九十六部。
    在制造牛马车的过程中，群众还想出了很多节约的办法。如以前的车轴用铁打，既花钱，又费工，打一根车轴需要三天三夜，光是买铁就要花二十五元。经过群众设法用硬青杠木代替铁轴后，一个钱都不花，只要从山上砍树子来锯成木轴就行了。这种青杠木用它一两年也不会坏，完全可以保证质量。同时，他们以木轮代替胶轮使用。平均每部木质车比铁轴、胶轮车的造价要少花七十元。
    群众看见这些牛马车的运输效率很高，都很高兴。瓦屋乡七十八岁的老农民李胡老说：“我家几辈人都没有看见过这种车子，现在你们可享福啦！这都是毛主席的英明领导。”
    在制造牛马车的同时，农民们还根据县里提出的“牛马车路上山，牛马车辆到户”的精神，连夜修建了一百六十一条牛马车路，长达三百七十八里半。目前，和平乡的农民已经在全乡建成了道路网，不仅社与社、队与队之间通牛马车，而且从平坝到山坡都有了牛马车路。
    新华社昆明21日电　云南边疆少数民族在生产大跃进中，大胆革新技术，改良和创造了近百种新工具。
    今年，边疆二百余万少数民族人民计划兴修水利灌溉一百五十万亩农田，积肥一百五十多亿斤。这样大规模的生产运动，是各少数民族历史上从来没有过的。这些民族生产技术比较落后，工具简陋，不能适应生产大跃进的要求。如佧佤、景颇、傈僳等民族使用铁器的时间还不长，牲畜普遍被杀来“献神祭鬼”，生产全靠人力。这种状况促使各族群众进行生产技术上的革命。西双版纳傣族自治州在大规模修水利和积肥中，缺乏运输工具，有人想把大量闲牛、闲马加以利用。最初制造牛车时，有些傣人不相信黄牛会拉车，后来工作干部在水利工地附近设立牛车训练场，亲自教傣人驾驶牛车。现在，全州已制造了一千多辆牛车运土送肥，工效比过去用人挑提高了九倍。傣人经过不断研究试验，并制造出九百多辆方便、省力、装土多的独轮手推车。中共西双版纳工委大力推广这些工具，要求在最近期间每户有一辆小推车，每五户一辆牛车。红河哈尼族彝族自治州的红河县，在生产跃进中改良了运输、夯压、爆破、测量等方面的工具二十七种，计划在全县三分之一地区消灭人挑人背的现象。据不完全统计，边疆各地创造、改良和新使用的工具不下百种，大大提高了兴修水利和积肥的工效，现在已完成兴修水利灌溉一百多万亩，占计划的70％，积肥料近七十亿斤，占计划44％。
