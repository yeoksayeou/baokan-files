An Unprecedented Happy Event in the History of Cantonese Opera

Recently, a joyous event, unprecedented in the history of Cantonese opera, has appeared on the Cantonese opera stage in Guangzhou. This is the Cantonese opera "Liu Hulan," performed by the Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Troupe, which reflects modern revolutionary heroes. Since its premiere during the Spring Festival, every performance has been sold out. The argument that Cantonese opera struggles to portray modern revolutionary themes, which was prevalent in the Cantonese opera world, has been proven false.

Chen Xiaochao, the actress who successfully plays Liu Hulan, felt that her emotions were originally fragile. In addition to reading many literary works depicting revolutionary heroes, she asked herself with every person and every thing she encountered: Is this how Liu Hulan would act? She took Liu Hulan as an example to demand of herself during the rectification and study sessions. She felt that she received a very profound education in the process of playing Liu Hulan.

    粤剧史上从未有过的喜事
    广州的粤剧舞台上最近出现了一件在粤剧史上从没有过的喜事。这就是广州粤剧团演出的反映现代革命英雄人物的粤剧“刘胡兰”。这个戏自春节演出以来，场场卖座。从来在粤剧界中认为粤剧很难表现现代革命题材的论调破产了。
    相当成功地扮演刘胡兰的演员陈小茶，感到自己原来感情比较脆弱，除了阅读许多描写革命英雄人物的文学作品以外，每对待一事一物都反问自己：刘胡兰是这样作的吗？她在参加整风学习中就以刘胡兰的榜样来要求自己。她觉得，在扮演刘胡兰的过程中自己受到很深刻的教育。
