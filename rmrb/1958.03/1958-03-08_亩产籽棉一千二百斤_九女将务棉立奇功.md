Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Guoning reports: In the cotton-producing area of ​​the 800-li Qin Chuan, the following story is spreading: Zhang Qiuxiang, deputy director of the Balidian Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, and the women's cotton farming team she leads, have cultivated high-yield cotton that has consistently produced around 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu for the past three years, becoming a red flag in agricultural production throughout the province.

The women's cotton farming team led by Zhang Qiuxiang began cultivating eight or nine mu of high-yield fields in 1955. In the first two years, the average yield was around 700 jin of seed cotton per mu, with about two mu of high-yield fields reaching over 1,100 jin to 1,200 jin of seed cotton per mu. Although the more than eight mu of high-yield fields planted last year suffered from natural disasters such as spring cold, summer floods, and autumn drought, they still achieved a high yield. In terms of lint cotton, it was 384% higher than the 70 jin per mu produced in the township, and more than four and a half times higher than the county's average yield of 60 jin per mu.

In 1955, the Balidian Agricultural Cooperative was established. It was a poor cooperative. Zhang Qiuxiang—a Communist Party member and deputy director of the agricultural cooperative—was constantly thinking: How to turn this poor cooperative into a rich cooperative, how to set an example of increased production, and how to convince everyone of the benefits of collectivization. She pondered day and night, and finally decided to organize a women's cotton farming team to set an example in increasing cotton production. So Zhang Qiuxiang spent a lot of effort to connect with Li Fengying, Gu Shufen, Li Lianying, Liu Qiufang, Zhu Shulan, Liu Huiqin, Ren Daojun, and Tian Fengqin, and formed a women's cotton farming team.

In the first year, they applied sufficient fertilizer to the cotton fields, selected good cotton seeds, and prepared the land very carefully. When the cotton seedlings emerged from the soil, it was also the wheat harvest season, and the workload gradually increased. They steamed steamed buns before dawn, spread out to thresh the wheat, and then rushed back to collect the wheat. While others rested in the shade of the trees after threshing, they took time to work on the cotton.

Their hard work was rewarded. In the first year, the high-yield cotton field of more than one mu harvested more than 1,200 jin of seed cotton per mu.

Now these nine female generals have become experts in cotton farming. On each of their cotton picking bags is printed the slogan "Socialist Construction Activists" in large red characters. This was awarded to them by the Weinan County People's Committee. The Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Committee are organizing agricultural cooperatives throughout the county to promote their cotton planting experience through visits, on-site meetings, and other forms.

The movement to learn from Zhang Qiuxiang and catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang has recently unfolded in Weinan County and across the 800-li Qin Chuan.

### 亩产籽棉一千二百斤  九女将务棉立奇功

    亩产籽棉一千二百斤
    九女将务棉立奇功
    本报特约新华社专稿　新华社记者张国宁报道：八百里秦川的产棉区，传播着下面的故事：陕西渭南县八里店农业社副主任张秋香和她领导的妇女务棉组务育的丰产棉花，过去三年连续亩产籽棉千斤上下，成为全省农业生产上的一杆红旗。
    张秋香领导的妇女务棉组从1955年开始务育八、九亩丰产田，头两年平均亩产籽棉七百斤上下，其中二亩左右的高额丰产田都达到亩产籽棉一千一百多斤到一千二百多斤。去年种植的八亩六分多丰产田虽遭春寒、夏涝、秋旱等自然灾害，仍然获得丰产。按皮棉计，高出本乡亩产七十斤的384％，高出全县平均亩产六十斤的四倍半以上。
    1955年八里店建立了农业社。这是一个穷社。张秋香——共产党员，农业社的副主任，时时刻刻想：怎样把这个穷社变成富社，怎样作出个样子增产，叫人人信服合作化的好处。她日夜思谋，最后决定组织一个妇女务棉组，在提高棉花产量上做出榜样来。于是张秋香花了很大功夫，才串连了李凤英、谷淑芬、李莲英、刘秋芳、朱淑兰、刘慧琴、任道君和田凤琴等八人，成立了一个妇女务棉组。
    头一年，她们给棉地上饱肥料，选好棉籽，地也整得很仔细。棉苗出土，又逢收麦时节，活路逐渐紧张。她们天不明蒸好馒头，摊了场，就上地打?；以后又急忙回来收场。别人摊场后就在树下歇荫凉，她们却抽空去务弄棉花。
    她们的辛勤劳动得到了应有的报酬。头一年一亩多高额丰产棉花每亩就收获一千二百多斤籽花。
    现在这九员女将都成务棉能手。她们每人的拾棉袋上，印着“社会主义建设积极分子”几个大红字。这是渭南县人民委员会奖给她们的。中共渭南县委和县人委正组织全县农业社通过参观、开现场会等形式，推广她们的植棉经验。
    学习张秋香、赶上张秋香的运动，最近正在渭南全县，在八百里秦川展开。
