Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Beijing, March 5th: The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in six higher education institutions in the capital has reached a climax, with simultaneous reports of exposing waste, criticizing conservatism, and promoting work-study programs pouring in.

    The six schools are the Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade, Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Agricultural University, and the Central Institute for Nationalities. Teachers and students in these schools are all competing to show their drive, their advancement, and their commitment to more, faster, better, and more economical results in this movement. Every school's mobilization meeting has become a rally for challenges and responses. Second-year students in the Foreign Trade Department of the Institute of Foreign Trade proposed to compare "Four Thoughts, Four Investigations, and Four Actions." The "Four Thoughts" are to think about contradictions (find problems), think about work, think about life, and think about education; the "Four Investigations" are to investigate public property, investigate systems, investigate work styles, and investigate ideology; the "Four Actions" are to mobilize the Party and Youth League, have cadres lead the way, have everyone take initiative, and take rapid action. Students in the First Department of the Institute of Aeronautics want to compete with all students in the school in production, learning, and political progress. Their slogan is: Empty-handed, starting from scratch, heroes act immediately. Ying Lian'geng, director of the Agricultural Economics Department, and Shen Jun, director of the Horticulture Department of the Agricultural University, respectively represented their departments in challenging other departments: Starting this year, the entire department's teaching and scientific research expenses will be fully self-sufficient. Xiao Ying, Party Secretary and Vice President of the Institute of Geological Exploration, also posted a big-character poster challenging all teachers and cadres to "fight hard for five years, be both Red and expert."

    After the mobilization meeting, big-character posters filled the walls of each school that evening, and the Institute of Geological Exploration even covered both sides of the sidewalk. While posting big-character posters, each school also held exhibitions against waste and conservatism.

    Students at the Institute of Geological Exploration decorated two people with collected wasted clothing and wrote a poem on them: "Do not move your limbs, cannot distinguish the five grains, open your mouth to eat, stretch out your hand for clothing. Extremely pampered, waste experts, the people will not allow it."

    Big-character posters also exposed the phenomenon of teaching being divorced from production and divorced from reality. Some big-character posters at the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Institute of Geological Exploration criticized some teachers for not paying attention to production, refusing to accept problems that industrial departments urgently need to solve for research, and unilaterally pursuing theory, resulting in a waste of time and energy without achieving anything.

    While exposing waste, teachers and students in various schools also put forward many suggestions for work-study programs and running schools diligently and thriftily. Some schools took action immediately after the suggestions were made. On March 3rd, the Beijing Institute of Technology held a school-wide mobilization meeting, and on the spot, comrades from the Organic Chemistry Teaching and Research Group of the Chemistry Department went on stage to announce the success of their trial production of "间苯三酚 (间苯三酚)," Phloroglucinol. Phloroglucinol is a type of chemical used to develop blueprints, currently, there is no factory producing this product in China. The next day, teachers from the First Mechanical Engineering Department also announced the good news of the successful trial production of a three-coordinate dynamic instrument. (Attached picture)

    首都六个高等院校师生个个当先
    院院双反　校校三比
    本报特约新华社专稿　北京5日讯：首都已有六个高等学校的反浪费反保守运动进入了高潮，现在是揭发浪费批判保守和勤工俭学的喜报同时涌来。
    这六个学校是北京对外贸易学院、北京地质勘探学院、北京工业学院、北京航空学院、北京农业大学和中央民族学院。这些学校的师生们都在这个运动中比干劲比先进比多、快、好、省。每个学校的动员会都成了挑战应战的誓师大会。对外贸易学院外贸系二年级学生提出比“四想、四查、四动”。四想即想矛盾（找问题）、想工作、想生活、想教育；四查即查公共财产、查制度、查作风、查思想；四动即党团发动、干部带动、人人主动、迅速行动。航空学院第一系的学生要和全校同学们比生产、比学习、比政治进步，他们的口号是：赤手空拳、平地起家、英雄好汉、说干就干。农业大学农业经济系主任应廉耕、园艺系主任沈隽分别代表两个系向各系挑战：从今年起全系教学和科学研究所用的经费，做到全部自给。地质勘探学院党委书记兼副院长萧英也贴出大字报和全校教师、干部比“苦战五年，又红又专”。
    动员会后，各校当晚大字报就贴满了墙，地质勘探学院还布满了人行道的两边空地。在张贴大字报的同时，各校也举办了反浪费反保守的展览会。
    地质勘探学院的学生们用搜集起来的浪费的衣物装饰了两个人，在上面写了一首诗：“四肢不勤，五谷不分，饭来张口，衣来伸手。娇气十足，浪费专家，人民不许。”
    大字报里也揭发了教学脱离生产脱离实际的现象。北京工业学院、地质勘探学院有些大字报批评了一些教师不重视生产，工业部门急于要解决的问题不肯接受下来研究，而片面地追求理论，结果浪费了时间和精力而一事无成。
    各校师生们在揭发浪费的同时，也提出许许多多勤工俭学、勤俭办学的建议。有些学校随建议随行动起来。3日北京工业学院举行全院动员大会，当场化学系有机化学教研组的同志就上台宣布了他们试制“间苯三酚”成功的消息。间苯三酚是晒图的一种药水，目前国内还没有工厂生产。第二天第一机械系的教师又传出了试制三线动力仪成功的喜讯。（附图片）
