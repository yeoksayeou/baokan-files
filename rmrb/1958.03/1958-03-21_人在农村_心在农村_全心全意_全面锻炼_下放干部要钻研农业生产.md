People in the Countryside, Hearts in the Countryside, Wholeheartedly, Comprehensive Training
Cadres Sent to Lower Levels Should Study Agricultural Production
The Shanghai Lower-Level Cadre Representative Conference Put Forward This Resounding Call

This newspaper Shanghai, March 18th dispatch: Today, Shanghai's cadres sent to lower levels held a representative conference in the spring of the Great Leap Forward. The representatives of 37,000 cadres sent to lower levels in the city firmly stated that they will not only be determined to train and transform themselves in the countryside, but also determined to study agricultural production, devote themselves wholeheartedly to the Great Leap Forward in the countryside, and truly train themselves into communist fighters who are both red and expert.

At the meeting, more than 900 representatives unanimously passed a resolution calling for an upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced among the cadres sent to lower levels in the city, and to launch a revolutionary competition with the cadres sent to lower levels in Beijing. The resolution guarantees: In terms of ideological transformation, we will ensure that people are in the countryside, hearts are in the countryside, wholeheartedly, and comprehensively trained, truly handing our hearts over to the farmers, and further establishing a clear class stand, a conscious attitude towards labor, and a firm mass viewpoint. In terms of labor production, we must study diligently and practice hard, and study technology. Ensure that we work 280 to 300 days a year, and ensure that within a year, in addition to mastering general production techniques, we must master a complete set of skills for one crop or animal husbandry. The resolution also guarantees to play an active role in rural literacy, eliminating the four pests, and greening, and sets out various guarantee indicators.

Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke to the cadres sent to lower levels at the meeting today, congratulating the cadres sent to lower levels in Shanghai for the achievements they have made after only three months of intense labor and life. These cadres sent to lower levels have already fallen in love with the countryside and have been able to adapt to rural life and heavy labor. The vast majority of the cadres sent to lower levels are full of energy, able to endure hardship and stand hard work, share weal and woe with the farmers, put down the airs of intellectuals, humbly learn from the farmers, and quickly master production techniques such as picking mud, weeding, irrigating, and plowing. Therefore, they have all won the trust and welcome of the vast number of farmers and established good relations with the farmers. Most of the cadres sent to lower levels also actively participated in various social and cultural work such as literacy and eliminating the seven pests. This kind of life has begun to change the thinking of the cadres sent to lower levels, and they have a deeper understanding of "every grain of rice and every bowl of porridge does not come easily."

Cao Diqiu especially pointed out that the cadres sent to lower levels should not be satisfied with the existing achievements, but should continue to move forward and achieve "both red and expert." He said: The saying that cadres sent to lower levels "can only be red but not expert" and "it is easy to be red but difficult to be expert" actually reflects that the cadres sent to lower levels are physically in the countryside, but their hearts are still in the city. He said: For the cadres sent to lower levels, being red means comprehensive training, and being expert means studying agricultural production and comprehensively supporting rural construction. If you do not wholeheartedly study agricultural production and rural work, and always think about coming back to engage in other work, comprehensive training will not be possible, and the issue of being red will also fail. To solve the problem of being both red and expert for the cadres sent to lower levels, we must first solve the problem of determination: whether it is wholeheartedly, or half-heartedly, or undecided.

More than 30 representatives signed up to speak at the meeting. In addition to introducing their ideological gains and various experiences, they unanimously agreed with Comrade Cao Diqiu's report, believing that it is necessary to be both red and expert in the countryside. They all expressed their intention to wholeheartedly engage in comprehensive training and wholeheartedly study agricultural production and rural work, and truly be good cadres who are both red and expert.

### 人在农村　心在农村　全心全意　全面锻炼  下放干部要钻研农业生产

    人在农村　心在农村　全心全意　全面锻炼
    下放干部要钻研农业生产
  上海下放干部代表会提出这一响亮号召
    本报上海18日电　今天，上海市下放干部在大跃进的春天里举行代表会议。全市三万七千名下放干部的代表坚决表示，不仅要下决心在农村中锻炼改造自己，也要下决心钻研农业生产，全心全意为农村大跃进献身，真正把自己锻炼成为又红又专的共产主义战士。
    会上，九百多名代表一致通过决心书，号召在全市下放干部中掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进的高潮，并以此同北京市下放干部展开革命竞赛。决心书中保证：在思想改造方面做到人在农村，心在农村，全心全意，全面锻炼，真正把心交给农民，进一步树立鲜明的阶级立场、自觉的劳动态度、坚强的群众观点。在劳动生产方面，要勤学苦练，钻研技术。保证一年出勤二百八十天到三百天，保证一年内除掌握一般生产技术外，要掌握一种农作物或畜牧的全套本领。决心书还保证在农村扫盲、除四害、绿化等方面起积极作用，并订出各种保证指标。
    中共上海市委员会书记处书记曹荻秋，今天到会向下放干部讲话，他祝贺上海市下放干部，经过短短三个月紧张的劳动生活所取得的成绩。这些下放干部已经爱上了农村，已经能够适应农村生活和繁重的劳动。绝大多数下放干部都是干劲十足，能吃苦耐劳，与农民同甘共苦，放下知识分子的架子，虚心向农民学习，并且很快地掌握了挑泥、锄草、车水、翻土等生产技术。因此，他们都得到了广大农民的信任和欢迎，同农民建立了良好的关系。大部分下放干部还积极地参加了扫盲、除七害等各项社会文化工作。这种生活使下放干部的思想开始发生了变化，他们对“一粥一饭来处不易”有了较深刻的体会。
    曹荻秋特别指出，下放干部不要满足现有的成绩，要继续前进，做到“又红又专”。他说：下放干部“只能红不能专”、“红容易专困难”的说法，实际上反映了下放干部身子虽在农村，心还在城市。他说：对下放干部来说，红就是全面锻炼，专就是钻研农业生产，全面支援农村建设。你们如果不全心全意钻研农业生产和农村工作，念念不忘回来搞其他工作，全面锻炼就不可能做到，红的问题也就要落空。解决下放干部的红与专问题，首先要解决决心问题：究竟是全心全意，还是半心半意，三心二意。
    会上有三十多个代表报名发言，他们除了介绍自己思想上的收获和各种经验外，一致同意曹荻秋同志的报告，认为在农村中做到又红又专，是必需的，他们都表示要一心一意全面锻炼，全心全意钻研农业生产和农村工作，真正做个又红又专的好干部。
