Random Notes on "Tianqiao"
		Dong Shanyuan

February 9th, the Tianqiao Department Store issued a revolutionary initiative to improve commercial work, sounding the bugle of revolution on the commercial front. In the past month, this department store has leaped forward again.

		Warehouse

More than six hundred people sat on sleepers or railroad ties, quietly listening to the narrator introduce the situation of the Great Leap Forward, listening so attentively. This is a simple warehouse, 258 square meters in area, without heating or sun lamps. However, it receives a constant stream of visitors every day. There are salespeople and managers from local and brother companies, workers from factories, cadres from institutions, postal and telecommunications personnel, medical personnel, university professors, and even Young Pioneers... Our country is such a warm collective, and anyone who makes a little achievement will receive the care and encouragement of the broad masses.

In fact, this warehouse itself is the most vivid explanation. Half a year ago, it was fully loaded with more than 200,000 yuan worth of goods, and some commodities had been backlogged for several years. Now, the funds occupied by the entire department store have been reduced from 320,000 yuan to less than 180,000 yuan, and this warehouse has had to "change careers." When the listeners hear about the touching deeds of the Tianqiao Department Store employees who have tried every means to save funds, dispose of stagnant goods, and implement sales-oriented procurement and quick sales, they will naturally look around this warehouse and think of the significance of a single unit being able to save 140,000 yuan of funds to support national construction.

		Blackboard Newspaper

The trade union propaganda committee member knows his readers very well, and the blackboard newspaper articles are getting shorter and shorter. Salespeople only need to walk past it, and a heart-stirring sentence or a moving number will inspire them.

"Six hundred and eighty-five pieces," this is the number of written commendations from customers in February, which is an honorary award for more than forty salespeople. Every salesperson will remember these numbers: 315 pieces in January of this year, 168 pieces in December of last year, and 67 pieces in November. No one mentions the number of pieces before the implementation of the service pledge in late October last year; that number is embarrassing. Now, more than forty people, 685 pieces, it is easy to calculate how many pieces per person on average. "My commendations have not reached the average number of pieces," and "I am far behind the comrade who received the most commendations," this thought will motivate the salespeople to create new achievements.

		After-Work Meeting

"Learn from Tianqiao, catch up with Tianqiao" has become the action slogan of commercial workers across the country. How do the employees of the Tianqiao Department Store think about this sentence?

Liang Cai, half a year ago, was still a salesperson who was generally recognized as having a poor service attitude, but now he is one of the excellent workers who are focused on by customers and visitors.

Today, it was originally Liang Cai's day off, but he still rushed to participate in the after-work meeting. It turned out that he did not rest, but went to visit brother branch stores. He couldn't wait to say something to everyone.

He visited the children's shoe section of the Xidan Department Store. As soon as he approached the counter, the salesperson took the initiative to take out shoes to introduce to him. He had to explain that he was here to visit. Wherever he went, he was greeted with the same initiative, so he couldn't be a quiet bystander. He visited the Baitasi branch of the department store. The enthusiasm of the salespeople deeply moved him, so he went to the trouble of buying a box of cold cream there. …

The comrades in the cosmetics group had not yet had time to speak, and Li Zhenan from the food group began to introduce his feelings about visiting the No. 1 Non-staple Food Store in the Qianmen district. Finally, he said, "I saw many advantages of others, and we must work hard to learn and continue to move forward!"

Yes, this is what everyone is thinking. Brother units who come to Tianqiao to visit may not have noticed that they are also the objects of visits by Tianqiao employees!

		Family Forum

With nearly half of the staff reduced, and one person doing the work of two people, will the family members worry that their loved ones are too tired? With one shift to the end, and not going home during the day, will the family members be dissatisfied?

As soon as the chairman of the trade union said, "Thank you to all family members for your support for our Great Leap Forward," the family members looked at each other, smiled, and showed a sense of pride: "The whole city is learning from you, and we are also honored!"

One family member said, "I was afraid that he would be tired, so I coaxed the child to make him sleep well. He said: What is this considered tired? It used to be that one person's work was done by two people, but now we are just getting started!" Another family member said: "I am not worried that he is tired, but I am afraid that he will not eat well, so I give him all the white flour at home to eat!"

### “天桥”散记

    “天桥”散记
    董善元
    2月9日，天桥百货商场发出了改进商业工作的革命倡议，在商业战线上吹响了革命的号角。一个月来，这个商场又向前跃进了。
    库房
    六百多人坐在马闸或枕木上，静静地听着讲解员介绍大跃进的情况，听得那样聚精会神。这是一幢简陋的库房，二百五十八公尺面积，没有暖气，也没有太阳灯。但是，它每天接待着川流不息的前来参观访问的人们。有本地和各地兄弟公司的营业员和管理人员、有工厂的工人、机关干部、邮电人员、医务人员，有大学教授，也有红领巾少年……。我们的国家就是这样一个温暖的集体，谁要是做出一点成绩，就会得到广大群众的关怀和鼓舞。
    其实，这座库房本身就是最生动的说明。半年以前，这里满满当当装着二十多万元的货物，有的商品已经积压几年了。现在呢，全商场占用的资金由三十二万元降低到十八万元以下，这座库房只好“转业”了。听讲的人们听到天桥商场的职工们千方百计节省资金、处理滞背商品和实行以销定进、勤进快销的动人事迹的时候，就会自然地环顾一下这座库房，联想到仅仅是一个单位就可以节省出十四万元资金支援国家建设的意义。
    黑板报
    工会宣传委员很了解他的读者，黑板报稿子越来越简短了。营业员们只要从它前面走过，一句激动人心的话或者一个动人的数字，就会受到鼓舞。
    “六百八十五件”，这是2月份顾客提出书面表扬意见的件数，这是对四十多个营业员的荣誉奖。每个营业员都会记得这些数字：今年1月份三百一十五件，去年12月份一百六十八件，11月份六十七件。去年10月下旬实行服务公约以前的件数就谁也不提了，那个数字是令人羞涩的。现在四十多人，六百八十五件，一人平均多少件是容易计算的。“我受的表扬还达不到平均件数”、“我比受表扬最多的同志还差得很远”，这个念头就会推动营业员们去创造新的成绩。
    班后会
    “学天桥、赶天桥”，已经是全国商业职工的行动口号，这句话在天桥商场职工们是怎样想的呢？
    梁材，半年前还是一个大家公认的服务态度不好的售货员，现在已经是顾客和参观者集中注意的优良工作者之一。
    今天，本来是梁材轮休的日子，他却仍然赶来参加班后会了。原来，他并没有休息，而是去参观了兄弟门市部。他迫不及待地有些话想和大家说。
    他参观了西单商场的童鞋组，刚走近柜台，售货员就主动拿出鞋来向他介绍，他只好说明自己是来参观的；他走到哪里，哪里都同样主动地向他打招呼，结果他竟不能安然地作个旁观者。他参观了百货公司白塔寺门市部，售货员的热情使他深受感动，他也就舍近求远在那里买了一盒香脂。……
    化妆组的同志们还没有来得及发言，食品组的李振安又介绍开了他参观前门区副食一店的感想。最后他说“我看到了人家的许多优点，咱们得努力学习继续前进啊！”
    是的，这是大家的心里话。到天桥来参观的兄弟单位也许还没有注意到他们同样是天桥职工们的参观对象呢！
    家属座谈
    人员减少了近一半，一个人要做原来两个人的工作，家属们会不会耽心自己的爱人过于劳累呢？实行了一班顶到底，白天不回家，家属会不会不满意呢？
    工会主席刚说“感谢各位家属对我们大跃进的支持”，家属们就互相看看、笑逐颜开，露出了自豪感：“全市都在向你们学习，我们也是光荣的！”
    有个家属说“我怕他累，就把孩子哄好，让他睡好觉，他说：这算什么累？早先是一个人的活两人干，现在刚刚使上劲！”另一个家属说：“我倒不耽心他累，就是怕他吃不好，我把家里的白面都尽着给他吃哩！”
