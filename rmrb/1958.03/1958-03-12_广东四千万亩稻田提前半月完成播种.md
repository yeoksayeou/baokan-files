Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 11th. Just three days after "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects), Guangdong Province has basically completed the sowing of nearly 40 million mu of rice fields, a full season earlier than in previous years. The famous high-yield grain area of ​​Chaoshan is already a busy scene of spring plowing. In order to accelerate the progress of spring plowing, some areas have also proposed using the revolutionary spirit of hard work and night battles to add night shifts and improve tools. Xinhui County in the Pearl River Delta is organizing "Three On the Fields" shock brigades, striving to live in the fields, eat in the fields, and work in the fields.

In previous years, sowing during "Yushui" (Rain Water) was considered very early. This year, farmers in various places have broken this convention. In the sandy fields of the Pearl River Delta, which have always been late in sowing and late in harvesting, many farmers sowed spring crops as early as mid-winter this year. Now, most of the early-sown seedlings are growing strong, some already three or four inches above the field surface. In the colder mountainous areas of northern Guangdong, sowing also began after "Yushui." The method of "raising seedlings during frost" has been widely promoted in many agricultural cooperatives, and the farmers of Lianshan County, who created this method, have already begun transplanting seedlings.

    广东四千万亩稻田提前半月完成播种
    新华社广州11日电　“惊蛰”后不过三天，广东省近四千万亩稻田的播种已经基本完成，较往年提早了一个节令。著名的粮食高产区潮汕地区，已是一片繁忙的春耕景象。为了加速春耕进度，有些地区还提出用苦战、夜战的革命干劲，加开夜工，改进工具。珠江三角洲的新会县，正在组织“三在田”的突击队，努力做到住在田间、食在田间、工作在田间。
    往年“雨水”播种已算很早。今年，各地农民都打破了这个常规。历来晚播迟收的珠江三角洲沙田区，今年许多农民早在隆冬就播下春种。现在早播秧苗多数长得健旺，有的已高出田面三、四寸。气候较冷的粤北山区，“雨水”一过也纷纷播种，“霜期育秧”的办法已在许多农业社普遍推行，而创造这个方法的连山县农民已开始插秧了。
