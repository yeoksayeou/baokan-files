    Catching Up From Behind
    — A Record of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory Improving Product Quality
    By Our Correspondent Wu Gang
    Xunzi said: "Indigo blue is extracted from the indigo plant, yet it is bluer than the plant itself; ice is made from water, yet it is colder than water." This is truly a profound saying. The product quality of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory was originally inferior to that of Shanghai, but they sincerely took Shanghai counterparts as their teachers, willingly acting as elementary school students, and learning with humility. Later, the student actually surpassed the teacher, rising to first place in the country.
    The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory was newly built in 1952. At that time, the nation's production of enamelware was far from meeting the needs of the military and the people. The Northwest region, which had no enamel industry, had to transport enamelware from Shanghai and other places thousands of miles away, incurring high transportation costs. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the area decided to use the grain obtained by soldiers from land reclamation and production, sell it for money, and invest in the establishment of an enamel factory, planting the seeds of the enamel industry in the Northwest region. More than 200,000 yuan and a few Party cadres transferred from the People's Liberation Army were all they had at the time.
          
    If You Don't Understand, Study Hard
    "Every industry is like a mountain," how could there not be difficulties for those who wielded guns to suddenly start running a factory? Yes, there were many difficulties; the most difficult was not understanding. They didn't understand production, didn't understand management, and couldn't even name the machines and raw materials. It was precisely because they didn't understand that they had suffered so much!
    If you don't understand, learn. The difficulty was that they couldn't even find the door to learning. To learn the formula for enamel powder, the factory's leading cadres went to Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai's enamel industry was still private. They consulted the capitalists, who replied: "The formula cannot be given, but you can buy the enamel powder. We will mix it and send it to you in Xi'an." They wanted to take a look at the mixing method, but they couldn't even enter the door of the powder mixing room. At that time, a man named Shen Jinhe ran to the hotel to find them, claiming that he had worked in an enamel factory in the past and was an engineer who understood the formula. He asked to go to Xi'an to work, with the conditions: he would be responsible for mixing the enamel powder, the formula would not be made public, and his monthly salary would be twenty bags of flour. In order to start production as soon as possible, the factory's cadres accepted these conditions. In January 1952, the factory finally officially started production.
    The problem arose. Production was proceeding very poorly. The engineer always locked himself in the room to mix the enamel powder, and the enamel powder he mixed was always unusable. When the leading cadres went to Shanghai to study again, people said: "Alas! He's a 'running errands' type, how can he do this?"
    Watching the state's property suffer huge losses, and being unable to complete the tasks assigned by the Party because they didn't understand the technology, how could this be allowed? The Party committee held a meeting to discuss and decided that leading cadres should personally get involved and study the technology. Factory director and Party secretary Di Linjie learned to mix powder, vice factory director Ma Ruying learned coating and firing, and vice factory director Sun Yaozeng learned blank making. They searched for and read materials such as the Industrial Encyclopedia; went to Shanghai to study again; and collected various formulas that others didn't use to study. Finally, they gradually grasped some of the key points. "Enamel is mainly manual operation, how can a socialist enterprise not let workers know the formula? If you don't make it public, I will make it public!" They organized, printed, and distributed the materials they had researched and learned to every worker, and then studied them together with the workers. The workers' morale was very high. At that time, they also received samples and formulas from a state-owned enamel factory in East China. After the cadres and workers studied them, they decided to experiment. However, when Factory Director Di asked the engineer to experiment, he refused. Moreover, when the cadres and workers wanted to experiment themselves, he even stopped the furnace. The cadres and workers went to a nearby glass factory to try firing. As a result, contrary to the engineer's claim, the samples produced were very good. After using this formula, the factory's products opened up a market for themselves in the Northwest region for the first time.
    Since then, new technical forces in the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory have gradually grown. Following the state's transfer of technician Zhang Shida, the Shanghai Enamel Factory after the public-private partnership also sent an old worker and Communist Party member, Wang Yuecheng, to support them. The workers' technical level has also greatly improved.
        
    Unease and Shame
    Life is always spent in sharp struggle. One problem is solved, and a new problem immediately appears. Just like their past combat life, as soon as one battle ended, a new battle task was waiting for them.
    In the spring of 1956, the factory faced serious difficulties. Products could not be sold; enamelware was piled up like mountains in the yard. Because funds could not be circulated, there was no money to buy raw materials, and even the workers' wages could not be paid. Leading cadres were restless, workers' morale was very low; all the staff and workers of the factory were anxious and uneasy, truly sitting on pins and needles.
    It turned out that things were like this. It is said that the quality of the factory's products had greatly improved compared to 1952, but compared to the quality of Shanghai's products and the ever-increasing demands of the masses, it was far behind. The masses wrote letters criticizing them, all saying that they welcomed Shanghai goods and did not want Xi'an goods.
    One day, Comrade Zhang Desheng went to the factory. He looked at every process, listened to the factory director's report, and talked to many workers. Finally, he put forward the following opinions to the cadres: "The quality of products has improved compared to 1952; but we should look forward, the people's needs have also improved; compared with the people's needs and compared with Shanghai, it is still far behind. The current central problem is to improve quality, increase variety, and reduce costs. If we can do this, the people will welcome it, and production can be increased; otherwise, we cannot meet the needs of the people, and the existence of the factory will become a problem."
    Words are the key to happiness. This speech pointed out the direction of the battle for all the staff and workers of the factory. They immediately took action. In order to solicit opinions from the masses, the factory held an exhibition, and the workers also went to the countryside and factories separately. They also compared, analyzed, and tested Shanghai products with their own factory's products. After a comparison, all the staff and workers clearly saw: Shanghai goods have a beautiful appearance, good gloss, neat shapes, bright colors, many varieties, and low prices; and what about the factory's products? Not clean, inconsistent sizes, uneven edges, uneven enamel powder, and there are powder lumps and pitting. When the staff and workers learned of the masses' criticisms and saw the comparison with Shanghai goods, they felt very ashamed; even when they went to department stores or markets to see Shanghai and their own factory's products and solicit opinions, they had to hide the factory emblem. However, this sense of shame motivated every staff and worker. A labor emulation campaign to improve quality and increase variety was launched vigorously.
  
    Hard Work for a Year, Surpassing Shanghai
    Leading cadres took workers to Shanghai in batches to study, and then quickly applied what they learned to improve their own production. They received enthusiastic help from the staff and workers of the Shanghai Enamel Factory after the public-private partnership. They adopted Shanghai's crimping machine to replace their past manual crimping operation, which was both standardized and efficient. They also increased dozens of products based on the opinions of the masses and using Shanghai samples as a reference: there were ladles, pot lids, lampshades, kettles; as well as medical utensils and various containers. As a result, their products changed from being unsalable to being popular, and the situation was completely reversed.
    Humility makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind. With the products selling well, pride was growing among the staff and workers. They thought that their factory was the first in the Northwest, the only one, and there was no need to worry about sales. "When radishes are pulled quickly, the mud is not washed off," people paid attention to increasing output, and no due attention was paid to quality. In order to overcome the staff and workers' thinking of valuing quantity over quality, the leadership calculated a bill with the workers: if the quality is improved by 10%, it is equivalent to increasing income by 10%; if we continue to fall behind, there is still a danger that the products will not be sold. When the workers realized that improving quality was the greatest saving, they put forward the battle task of "Surpassing Shanghai in 1957 and removing the label of backwardness." The entire factory's staff and workers fought hard for a whole year to complete this task. From the beginning of the year, they progressed step by step, until the end of the year, the first-class quality rate of the main products reached more than 80%, exceeding Shanghai.
    In late February last year, cadres from the Silicate Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, along with Shanghai technicians and veteran workers, came to this factory. They, together with local industrial leading cadres and the factory's cadres, formed a pilot work group, went deep into the workshops, produced with the workers, and shared weal and woe. They focused on the advanced tenth group in the middle section of the three sections of enamel production—the coating and firing section—and discovered a series of quality problems in each section. Then, they worked with technicians and workers to jointly study and experiment, and persevered until the problem was solved. In the past, the workshop was dusty and there were many garbage spots on the products. The cadres carried out a thorough cleaning with the workers and technicians. There were shortcomings in the enamel powder formula, and the cadres and workers and technicians jointly researched, selected, and formulated the best twenty-five types from dozens of domestic and foreign formula materials for use. The rolling mill in blank making was uneven and had wrinkles. The cadres went to Tianjin with the workers to learn the wrinkle-free blank pressing method, and then promoted it throughout the factory...
    After a year of hard work, the product quality of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory finally exceeded that of Shanghai. According to the national indicator requirements, the internal adhesion of enamel is 8,000 to 10,000 grams. That is to say, using an iron ball weighing 8,000 to 10,000 grams, impact the enamel product from a height of one meter, requiring that the inner layer of porcelain does not fall off. However, the factory's products have reached 12,000 grams; not only does the inner black porcelain not move, but even the outer layer of porcelain remains intact. The highest of some products in Shanghai only reaches about 10,000 grams. The gloss of the factory's products also exceeds Shanghai products, reaching more than 90 degrees. The appearance is also more beautiful than Shanghai's, and the enamel is uniform and delicate. Acid resistance and heat resistance both exceed Shanghai products. In the past, Xi'an sales departments bought products from Shanghai as samples for acceptance of local products; now, on the contrary, Shanghai sales departments want to buy Xi'an products as samples for acceptance of local products. The price of the factory's products is also 13% lower than Shanghai and the national average.
    At the Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou, the factory's products won high praise at home and abroad. Since then, their 280,000 pieces of products have entered the international market for the first time. Since then, enamel factories across the country have continued to send people to the factory to study, or request to send workers to introduce the experience of improving quality.
  
    Surpassing International Advanced Levels in Three Years
    The best way to prevent pride is to propose new and more arduous combat tasks after winning a victory. Just as pride was growing among the staff and workers of the factory, the Party Central Committee put forward the battle call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years. The factory's leading cadres, who were relatively clear-headed, knew that the quality indicators of some of their products last year were not good enough; they had not mastered the technology of industrial enamel needed for the country's construction; they only knew general enamel knowledge, and were far from the red and expert requirements of the Party; but most importantly, as Vice Factory Director Ma Ruying said: "Good heavens! Everyone is leaping forward, do you know what good tricks others have come up with? The needs of the people and construction have increased, and if you don't move forward, you will fall behind. Being proud for a moment is terrible!" We must move forward to a higher level. Now, the factory's staff and workers have put forward a new battle slogan: "Surpass the international level in daily-use enamel within three years; reach the international advanced standard in industrial enamel within eight years!"
    At present, the battle for the factory to reach the peak of international enamel production has begun. They are starting to collect materials and samples from various countries, and are also sending people to various parts of the country to learn various new experiences. Staff and workers who will go to various industrial construction units, ethnic minority areas, and rural areas to understand the people's needs for enamelware will set off soon.

    后来居上
    ——记西安人民搪瓷厂提高产品质量的经过
    本报记者  吴钢
    荀子说：“青，取之于蓝而青于蓝；冰，水为之而寒于冰。”这真是一句至理名言。西安人民搪瓷厂的产品质量，本来不如上海，可是他们诚恳地拜上海同业为师，甘当小学生，虚心的学习，以后学生竟然赶过老师，跃居全国第一。
    西安人民搪瓷厂是1952年新建的。那时，全国搪瓷品的生产远满足不了军民的需要。没有搪瓷工业的西北地区，要从千里之外的上海等地运来搪瓷品，运费很大。驻在当地的人民解放军某部，决定用战士们开荒生产得到的粮食，卖成钱，投资兴办搪瓷厂，给西北地区播下搪瓷工业的种子。二十多万元和从解放军抽调的几个党员干部，就是当时所有的一切。
          不懂就钻
    “隔行如隔山”，拿枪杆的一下办起工厂来，岂能没有困难吗？是的，困难很多；其中最困难的就是不懂。他们不懂生产，不懂管理，甚至连机器、原材料的名字都叫不上来。也就是因为不懂，他们曾经吃过多么大的苦头呵！
    不懂就学，困难的是他们连学习也不得其门而入。为了学习琅粉的配方，这个厂的领导干部到上海去。那时，上海的搪瓷业还是私营。他们请教资本家，回答是：“配方不能给，要用琅粉可以买，我们配下给你们寄到西安去。”他们想看一下配制方法，但是，连配粉室的门都不能进去。那时候，有个叫沈金鹤的，跑到旅馆找他们，自称过去他干过搪瓷厂，是懂得配方的工程师。他要求到西安去工作，条件是：配琅粉由他负责，配方不公开，每月报酬是二十袋面粉。为了尽快开工生产，这个厂的干部便接受了这些条件。1952年元月工厂总算正式开工生产了。
    问题出来了。生产进行得非常糟。工程师总是关住门子配琅粉，配的琅粉总是不能用。领导干部再到上海去学习时，人们说：“唉！他是个‘跑合’的，怎么能干这个呢？”
    眼看着国家财产遭受巨大的损失，因为不懂技术，不能完成党交给的任务，这怎样能行呢？党委会开会研究，决定领导干部亲自去干，钻研技术。厂长兼党委书记邸林杰学配粉，副厂长马儒英学涂烧，副厂长孙耀增学制坯。他们搜罗了工业大全等资料来阅读；到上海再去学习；搜集别人不用的各种配方来研究，终于渐渐地摸着点门道了。“搪瓷主要是手工业操作，社会主义的企业怎么能不让工人知道配方呢？你不公开我公开！”他们便把自己研究和学习所得到的材料整理、打印出来，发给每个工人，再共同和工人研究。工人情绪非常高。就在那时，他们也接到华东一家公营搪瓷厂的样品和配方，干部和工人研究之后，决定试验。但是，当邸厂长请工程师试验时，却遭到拒绝。而且当干部同工人要自己试验时，他竟然把炉子停烧了。干部同工人就到附近玻璃厂去试烧，结果，和工程师的说法相反，打出的样板非常好，使用这个配方之后，这个厂的产品第一次在西北地区为自己打开了出路。
    此后，西安人民搪瓷厂新的技术力量渐渐成长起来。随着国家调来技术员张士达之后，公私合营后的上海搪瓷厂也派一个老工人、共产党员王月成，来支援他们。工人的技术水平也有很大提高。
        不安和羞愧
    生活总是在尖锐的斗争中度过的。一个问题解决了，新的问题又立刻出现。正像他们过去的战斗生活一样，一个战斗刚结束，新的战斗任务又在等待着他们。
    1956年春，这个厂面临着严重的困难。产品无法销售；搪瓷品在院子里堆积如山。因为资金无法周转，没有钱买原料，甚至连工人的工资也没法开支。领导干部坐卧不宁，工人情绪非常低落；全厂职工焦急、不安，真是如坐针毡。
    原来事情是这样的。论说这个厂的产品质量，比起1952年来，已经有很大的提高，但是，要和上海的产品质量相比，和日益增长着的群众要求相比，那就差得远了。群众纷纷来信批评他们，都说欢迎上海货，不愿意要西安货。
  　有一天，张德生同志到工厂去。他看了每一道工序，听了厂长的汇报，和许多工人谈过话。最后，他向干部提出下列意见：“产品质量比1952年提高了；但应当向前看，人民的需要也提高了；和人民需要以及和上海相比，还差的很远。目前的中心问题是提高质量，增加花色品种，降低成本。如果作到这点，人民会欢迎，生产就能增加；否则，不能满足人民需要，工厂的存在都要发生问题。”
    话是开心的钥匙。这一席话给全厂职工指明了战斗方向。他们立刻行动起来了。为了征求群众意见，这个厂举办了展览会，工人还分头到农村和工厂去。他们还把上海的产品拿来和本厂的比较、分析、化验。一比之下，全体职工都清楚的看到：上海货外观漂亮，光泽好，造形整齐，花色鲜艳，品种多，价格低；而本厂的产品呢？不干净，大小不一，边子薄厚不均，搪粉不匀，又是粉疙瘩，又是麻点。当职工知道群众的批评和看了和上海货的对比之后，感觉到十分羞愧；甚至到百货公司或市场上，去看上海和本厂的产品、征求意见时，都要藏起厂徽。然而，这种羞愧的心理，激励着每一个职工。为提高质量、增加花色品种的劳动竞赛运动，轰轰烈烈的展开了。
  苦干一年，赶过上海
    领导干部带着工人分批到上海去学习，而后又把学习到的迅速运用，来改进自己的生产。他们得到公私合营后的上海搪瓷厂职工们的热心帮助。他们采用了上海卷边机，代替自己过去的手工卷边操作，既规格，效率又高。他们还根据群众的意见和以上海样品为借鉴，增加了几十种产品：有马勺、锅盖、灯罩、水壶；也有医药用具和各种容器。这一来，他们的产品由滞销而变为畅销，形势完全扭转了。
    虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。在产品畅销的情况下，骄傲思想在职工中滋长着。他们以为本厂是西北首创，独此一家，不愁销售。“萝卜快了不洗泥”，人们注意的是产量提高，至于质量呢，都没有给以应有的注意。为了克服职工重量轻质的思想，领导上和工人算了一笔账：如果质量提高10％，就等于增加10％的收入；如果再落后下去，仍然会发生产品销售不了的危险。当工人认识到提高质量便是最大的节约时，他们便提出“1957年赶过上海，摘掉落后帽子”的战斗任务。而在完成这个任务中，全厂职工整整苦战了一年。从年初开始，他们就一步步前进，直到年底，主要产品的一级品就达到80％以上，超过了上海。
    去年2月下旬，中央轻工业部硅酸盐工业管理局的干部，带着上海的技术人员和老工人，来到了这个厂。他们和当地工业领导干部以及本厂干部，共同组成试点工作组，深入到车间去，和工人一道生产，同甘苦。他们以搪瓷生产三个工段里的中间工段——涂烧工段先进的第十小组为重点，发现了各个工段中一系列质量上的问题。然后，再和技术人员、工人共同研究、试验，坚持不懈地干下去，直到问题解决为止。过去车间尘土飞扬，产品上垃圾点很多，干部就和工人、技术人员一道进行彻底的扫除。琅粉配方上有缺点，干部和工人、技术人员共同从几十种国内外配方资料中，综合研究、选择和配制出最好的二十五种来使用。制坯中轧车压光不平，有绉纹，干部就同工人到天津去学习无绉纹压坯法，然后在全厂推广……。
    经过一年的苦干，西安人民搪瓷厂的产品质量，终于超过了上海的产品。按照国家的指标要求，搪瓷的内在密着力是八千到一万克厘。就是说用重达八千到一万克厘的铁球，从一公尺的高处向搪瓷产品冲击下去，要求它的里层瓷不掉。但是，这个厂的产品已经达到一万二千克厘；不只里层黑瓷不动，就是连外层的瓷也安然不掉。上海有的产品最高才达到一万克厘左右。这个厂产品的光度也超过上海产品，达到九十度以上。外观也较上海的美观，搪瓷均匀而细致。耐酸、耐热都超过上海产品。过去西安销售部门都是从上海买来产品，做为验收当地产品的样品；现在正相反，上海销售部门却要买西安的产品，做为验收当地产品的样品。这个厂的产品价格也比上海和全国都低13％。
    在广州举行的出口商品展览会上，这个厂的产品在国内外获得了很高的声誉。从那时起，他们的二十八万件产品第一次走入国际市场。从那时起，全国各地搪瓷厂不断派人来这个厂学习，或者要求派工人去介绍提高质量的经验。
  三年超过国际先进水平
    要防止骄傲思想，最好的办法是在打完胜仗之后，提出新的更艰巨的战斗任务。正当这个厂职工中滋长着骄傲思想的时候，党中央提出了十五年赶上英国的战斗号召。头脑比较清醒的厂的领导干部，深知他们去年有的产品质量指标还完成的不够好；他们还没有掌握生产祖国建设日益需要的工业搪瓷的技术；他们还只知道一般搪瓷知识，和党所要求的又红又专相差甚远；然而最重要的，正像这个厂马儒英副厂长说的：“老天爷！大家都在跃进，你知道人家又想出什么好招来呢？人民和建设的需要提高了，你不前进就要落在后面。骄傲一下可了不得呀！”要向更高的水平前进。现在，这个厂的职工提出了一个新的战斗口号：“三年以内在日用搪瓷上超过国际水平；八年以内在工业搪瓷上达到国际先进标准！”
    目前，这个厂为达到国际搪瓷生产顶峰的战斗已经开始了。他们正着手搜集各国的资料和样品，还派人到全国各地去学习各种新的经验。到各工业建设单位、少数民族区域和农村了解人们对搪瓷品需要的职工，不久就要出发了。
