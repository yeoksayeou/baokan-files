Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 11th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio told reporters today that if the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization discusses Indonesian issues within their own "security scope," that is nothing "special," but if they discuss Indonesian internal affairs, "that is unacceptable to us."

Subandrio said that the Indonesian government has done its best through diplomatic channels to let foreign countries know that foreign interference in Indonesia's internal affairs will only be harmful to themselves.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, March 11th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic issued a statement today, accusing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is holding a meeting in Manila, of attempting to turn the territories of some Asian countries into bridgeheads for atomic war at the request of U.S. imperialism, and pointed out that the member states of this organization will be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. The statement said that the Asian people resolutely do not allow nuclear war to occur and will fight for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia.

The statement also condemned the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 11th: "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today saying that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's board meeting currently being held in Manila is a serious threat to peace in Asia and an act of provocation by the imperialists against the Asian people.

The newspaper said that the Korean people warmly support the TASS statement on the 8th, which pointed out a clear path to lasting peace in Asia, and resolutely condemn the Manila conference's conspiratorial activities to intensify atomic war preparations in Asia. The newspaper emphasized that a nuclear-weapon-free zone must be established in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: TASS, Tokyo, March 10th: Commenting on the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's council meeting that opened in Manila, "Akahata" said that the meeting attempts to link the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization, making the international situation more tense. In other words, the purpose of the meeting is to hinder the Asian people's efforts to achieve peaceful coexistence, incite the "Cold War," and restore colonial rule.

"Akahata" emphasized that the schemers of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are aiding the Indonesian rebels, thereby interfering in the internal affairs of the country. The commentary also mentioned the United States' attempt to drag Japan into the scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: TASS, Tokyo, March 11th: Commenting on the opening of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Manila council meeting, the "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the characteristic of this meeting is that it is being held against the background of the Soviet Union raising major international issues such as convening a summit meeting, establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and concluding an Asian collective peace treaty.

The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposals for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and concluding a collective peace treaty in Asia are of direct concern to Asian countries and peoples.

Commenting on the TASS statement on the Manila meeting, the "Mainichi Shimbun" said that there is no doubt that the Soviet proposal will receive a positive response in some countries because, in the minds of many people in Asian countries, a collective security system is more attractive than a system of two opposing hostile groups.

Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: Bangkok News: Four members of parliament from the Thai Socialist United Front handed an emergency appeal to Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom on the 6th, requesting him to order the Thai representatives attending the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization council meeting not to participate in discussions on issues related to Indonesian internal affairs, nor to express any opinions on this issue. The four members of parliament who signed the appeal were: Nai Krairiksh, Nai Sawang, Nai Thawilseat, and Nai Charoen. The appeal stated that Indonesia is an independent country, a member of the United Nations, and has a long-standing friendly relationship with Thailand. Discussing any of the country's internal affairs means interfering in the country's internal affairs. This not only violates the principles of the United Nations but also affects the relationship between Thailand and Indonesia.

    不准在亚洲准备原子战争
    不准干涉印度尼西亚内政
    印度尼西亚外长警告
    不得讨论印度尼西亚内政问题
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天对新闻记者说，如果东南亚条约组织在他们自己的“安全范围以内”讨论印度尼西亚问题，那是没有甚么“特别的”，但是，要是他们讨论印度尼西亚内政问题，“那是我们所不能接受的”。
    苏班德里约说，印度尼西亚政府已经尽力通过外交途径使外国知道，外国干涉印度尼西亚内部事务只会对它本身有害。
    蒙古外交部声明
    亚洲人民不允许核战争发生
    新华社乌兰巴托11日电　蒙古人民共和国外交部今天发表声明，指责正在马尼拉举行会议的东南亚条约组织企图按照美帝国主义的要求，把亚洲某些国家的领土变为原子战争的桥头堡，并且指出，这个组织的成员国要对由此引起的一切后果负责。声明说，亚洲人民坚决不允许核战争发生，并且将为在亚洲建立无核武器地区斗争。
    声明还谴责东南亚条约组织干涉印度尼西亚的内政。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”谴责说
    会议是对亚洲人民的挑衅
    据新华社平壤11日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表评论说，东南亚条约组织正在马尼拉举行的理事会会议是对亚洲和平的严重威胁，是帝国主义者对亚洲人民的挑衅行动。
    报纸说，朝鲜人民热烈支持为亚洲的持久和平指出明确道路的塔斯社8日的声明，并且坚决斥责马尼拉会议在亚洲加紧进行原子战争准备的阴谋活动。报纸强调指出，必须建立亚洲无核武器区。
    日本报纸评论说
    会议企图阻挠亚洲人民的和平努力
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社东京10日讯：“赤旗报”在评论在马尼拉开幕的东南亚条约组织理事会会议时说，这次会议企图把东南亚条约组织同北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织联结起来，使国际局势更加紧张。换句话说，会议的目的在于阻碍亚洲人民致力于和平共处的努力，煽动“冷战”和恢复殖民主义统治。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，东南亚条约组织的策谋者援助印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，从而干涉了这个国家的内政。评论还提到美国极力想把日本拖进东南亚条约组织范围的阴谋。
    新华社11日讯　塔斯社东京11日讯：“读卖新闻”在评论东南亚条约组织理事会马尼拉会议开幕时说，这次会议的特点是：它是在苏联提出了像召开高级会议、建立无原子武器地区和缔结亚洲集体和平公约这些重大国际问题的背景下举行的。
    报纸指出，苏联关于在亚洲建立无原子武器地区和在亚洲缔结集体和平公约的建议对亚洲国家和人民有直接的利害关系。
    “每日新闻”在评论塔斯社关于马尼拉会议的声明时说，毫无疑问，苏联这个建议会在一些国家中得到积极的反应，因为在亚洲许多国家人民的心目中，集体安全体系比两个针锋相对的敌对集团体系更有吸引力。
    泰国四议员呼吁
    泰国代表不要参与干涉印度尼西亚内政
    据新华社11日讯　曼谷消息：泰国社会主义联合阵线的四位议员在6日把一份紧急呼吁书交给泰国总理乃他侬，要求他命令出席马尼拉条约组织理事会会议的泰国代表不要参与讨论有关印度尼西亚内政的问题，也不要对这个问题表示任何意见。在呼吁书上署名的四位议员是：乃克莱、乃沙旺、乃他威塞和乃乍能。呼吁书说，印度尼西亚是一个独立的国家，是联合国的会员国，同泰国有着悠久的友好关系，讨论这个国家的任何内政问题都意味着干涉这个国家的内政。这不仅违背联合国的原则，而且会影响泰国同印度尼西亚的关系。
