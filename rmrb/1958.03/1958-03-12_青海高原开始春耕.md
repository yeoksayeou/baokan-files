    Qinghai Plateau Begins Spring Ploughing
    (Special dispatch to this newspaper from Xining) Spring has arrived on the Qinghai Plateau, and 1.4 million farmers of all ethnic groups are competing and supporting each other as they begin spring ploughing and sowing.
    The climate is warmer in the river valleys along the southern bank of the Yellow River's upper reaches, and the Salar and Tibetan farmers living there were the first to sound the bugle call for spring ploughing. Following them, Han and Tu farmers along the Huangshui River also began sowing spring wheat and highland barley in the irrigated land. In the mountainous areas north of the Huangshui River, the ground is still frozen one or two feet deep, and farmers of all ethnic groups are still working hard in the freezing cold to repair canals, deliver fertilizer, and level fields, intensifying their preparations for spring ploughing.
    Due to the complex terrain and climate, spring ploughing and sowing on the Qinghai Plateau progresses from southeast to northwest, from irrigated land to dry mountain land, spanning two to three months; the sowing period for each agricultural cooperative also varies for shaded slopes, sunny slopes, river lands, and mountain lands. Therefore, many neighboring townships and cooperatives have established mutual support agreements, conducting friendly competitions on the one hand, and using manpower, livestock, and new agricultural tools to support each other according to need on the other hand.

    青海高原开始春耕
    本报特约新华社西宁电　春到青海高原，一百四十万各族农民互相竞赛，互相支援，开始春耕播种。
    黄河上游南岸的河谷地带气候较暖，居住在那里的撒拉族和藏族农民首先吹响了春耕的号角。接着，湟水沿岸的汉族和土族农民也开始在川水地播种春小麦和青稞。湟水北岸山区仍然地冻一两尺，各族农民还在严寒中修渠、送肥和平整田地，加紧做各种春耕准备工作。
    由于地形和气候复杂，青海高原的春耕播种由东南向西北、由川水地向山旱地发展，要绵延两三个月；每个农业社的阴坡、阳坡、川地、山地的播种期也迟早不一。因而许多邻近的乡和社都互相挂钩，一面进行友谊竞赛，一面根据需要用人力、畜力和新式农具互相支援。
