Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Military Attaché of the German Democratic Republic to China, Lieutenant Colonel Weinhold, and his wife, held a reception in Beijing this evening to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic.

Among those invited to the reception were: Vice Premier of the State Council, Marshal He Long; Vice Ministers of National Defense, General Li Da, General Zhang Zongxun, General Xiao Hua, General Hong Xuezhi, General Yang Chengwu, General Peng Shaohui, General Lai Chuanzhu, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as officers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Beijing.

Also invited to the reception was Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan.

Diplomatic envoys and military attachés of various countries to China were also invited to the reception.

Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, Mr. Pirbach, also attended the reception.

Lieutenant Colonel Weinhold said in his speech at the reception that the establishment of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic in 1956 was a necessary measure to defend the achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic in socialist construction, after the Federal Republic of Germany joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and, supported by the American aggressive bloc, established an aggressive army. He said that the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic has no aggressive intentions. Standing on the western front of the powerful socialist camp, it defends the peaceful labor of the German Democratic Republic shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet army, and is vigilant against the development of West German militarism. As an equal participant in the Warsaw Treaty, it resolutely fulfills all the obligations of the Warsaw Treaty.

Lieutenant Colonel Weinhold said that the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic celebrates its founding anniversary in the spirit of the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of Germany and China, and in the close fighting friendship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which guards peace on the eastern frontier. He wished all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army new and greater achievements in political education and military training.

Marshal He Long spoke at the reception. He extended warm congratulations to the fraternal National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic on behalf of all members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said that the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is the first workers' and peasants' army of the German people. In the past two years, under the correct leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and with the support of the German people, the National People's Army has made tremendous achievements in military construction and combat training. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is greatly encouraged by these great achievements of the fraternal National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic.

Marshal He Long said that the people and armies of China and Germany have always had a profound friendship. We believe that the friendship between the people and armies of China and Germany will continue to be consolidated and developed in the future.
