Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 15th: The Hua Damen Agricultural Cooperative in Bazhen Township, Chao County, Anhui Province, has set a new national record for unit yield of fish raised in rice paddies. Last year, the cooperative raised carp in 31.8 mu of rice paddies, with an average yield of over 173 jin per mu. Among them, 1.4 mu of rice paddies harvested a total of 664.5 jin of fish before the Spring Festival, yielding 482 jin per mu. This record greatly exceeds the previous record of 70 jin per mu for fish raised in rice paddies, set by Hunan Province.

The Hua Damen Agricultural Cooperative is located on the north bank of Baihu Lake, and the farmers have traditionally raised fish in rice paddies. After raising fish in the rice paddies, the fish can eat rice borers and weeds, which can promote increased rice production. Last year, the rice paddies where fish were raised throughout the cooperative had an average yield of 450 jin of rice per mu, 52 jin more than the yield of ordinary rice paddies. The fish can also feed on mosquito larvae in the fields, which is of great benefit to the rural "Four Pests" elimination campaign.

    稻田养鱼产量最高纪录
    新华社合肥15日电　安徽巢县坝镇乡花大门农业社创造稻田养鱼单位产量的全国最高纪录。这个社去年养了三十一点八亩稻田的鲤鱼，平均每亩产鱼一百七十三斤多。其中有一点四亩稻田在春节前共捕捞了六百六十四点五斤鱼，亩产四百八十二斤。这个纪录大大超过了湖南省创造的稻田养鱼亩产七十斤的纪录。
    花大门农业社在白湖北岸，农民向来有稻田养鱼的习惯。稻田养鱼以后，鱼能吃二化螟和杂草，可以促使水稻增产。去年，全社养鱼的稻田，平均亩产稻谷四百五十斤，比一般稻田亩产量多五十二斤。鱼儿还可以追食田里的孑孓，对农村除四害工作也有很大好处。
