Notes

    Power is in the Hands of the Japanese People
    At a time when the broad masses of the Japanese people are strongly demanding the elimination of the threat of atomic war and the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Asia, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi openly stated in the Diet on the 28th that, according to the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty," the United States "has the right" to transport nuclear weapons into Japan. In this way, Nobusuke Kishi's betrayal of the people's will and the selling out of national interests has been completely exposed. In the past, Nobusuke Kishi had always pretended that he had no intention of allowing the United States to transport nuclear weapons into Japan.
    People must ask: If Japan were still an independent country, how could the United States have the "power" and "right" to turn Japan into a nuclear base? Although the likes of Nobusuke Kishi are bent on selling this kind of "power" and "right" that concerns the survival of the nation at a cheap price, the ninety million Japanese people have the right to stop his traitorous act!

    权在日本人民手中
    在日本广大人民强烈要求消除原子战争威胁，要求建立亚洲无原子武器区的时候，日本首相岸信介28日公然在众议院中说什么根据“日美安全条约”美国“有权”把核武器运进日本。这样，岸信介违反人民意志、出卖民族利益的面目就暴露无遗了。岸信介过去一直还假装他无意允许美国把核武器运入日本的。
    人们要问：如果日本还是个独立的国家，美国怎会有把日本变成核基地的“权力”和“权利”呢？尽管岸信介之流一心想把关系国家存亡的这种“权力”和“权利”贱价出卖，九千万日本人民却有权制止他的这种卖国勾当！
