	Positive and Negative
	Liu Zhongping

	The U.S. intelligence agency's survey report on the situation in Japan included two entries in its August issue last year: one was "the rampant Sun Tribe and its moral impact," and the other was "the two atomic bomb memorial days and their impact." It evaluated these two events based on whether they were beneficial to the activities of the U.S. intelligence agency: the former scored eight points, while the latter scored negative eight points. One positive and one negative, forming a stark contrast. This is a true revelation from the likes of Allen Dulles.

	"Sun Tribe" is a new term that became popular in Japan after the war. At first glance, it may give people a bright and pleasant association, but in fact, it refers to characters in the gutter. The term comes from a novel "Season of the Sun" written the year before last by a young author, Shintaro Ishihara. This novel depicts a group of college students whose lives are characterized by debauchery, heavy drinking, and brawling, and whose spiritual outlook is shameless and ruthless. In short, they are nothing more than hoodlums and spoiled brats. Although some people believe that the complexity of the language and the vulgarity of the descriptions in this work are "pre-literary," the book was able to create a sensation and make the term "Sun Tribe" popular for a time, reflecting a distorted social state in post-war Japan. Of course, this cannot but cause concern for some thoughtful people. Many Japanese mothers have worried about how to protect their children from the influence of the "Sun Tribe"; many educators and professors have also seriously explored the social causes of the "Sun Tribe." There may be many reasons, but there is one that they all agree on: that is the influence spread by American pornographic and morally corrupting novels, movies, and television films.

	The "Sun Tribe" is an ulcer in Japanese society. And this ulcer is growing in the middle of the youth class, which has the danger of rotting from the roots. The U.S. intelligence agency, like a fly seeing blood, grinned and gave it a positive eight points. The intention behind this is self-evident.

	The "two atomic bomb memorial days" need no further explanation. The two disasters in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not only indelible wounds in the hearts of the Japanese people but also dark memories that all kind people around the world cannot forget. Many people have already seen that the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki when Japan had already sought peace were not to end the war but to start a new Cold War. This Cold War has continued to this day. Although the U.S. atomic monopoly has long been lost and the "policy of strength" has long gone bankrupt, the U.S. warmongers are still desperately clinging to atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, like a person hanging from a noose. And they also want to stuff the necks of their partners into the noose, including Japan, of course. However, the Japanese people's anti-atomic bomb and anti-hydrogen bomb movement is like a raging tide, growing unabated. The U.S. wants to openly transport nuclear weapons into Japan, but it cannot but be cautious. Some ruling Japanese samurai, wanting to accept U.S. nuclear weapons, cannot but hesitate. The U.S. intelligence agency feels like it has thorns in its back about this movement and wants to get rid of it quickly, so giving it a negative eight points is not surprising.

	However, this one positive and one negative reveal the U.S.'s true intentions towards Japan. Although Allen Dulles is engaged in dirty tricks, he is, after all, more frank than his older brother, Foster Dulles, who serves as Secretary of State. What tune does that Secretary of State Dulles sing? It's the tune of "common cooperation" and opposition to "communist threats." He sings it not only to Japan but also to other U.S. "partners," singing it endlessly. In fact, this is the same tune as the old lady singing to scare children, "The wolf is coming, the tiger is coming," the purpose is to make the other party obedient. His younger brother, Allen Dulles, does not beat around the bush but says directly, I like the "Sun Tribe," I hate the "anti-hydrogen bomb," of course, the purpose is also the same: to make the other party obedient. Because the rampage of the "Sun Tribe," no matter how harmful it is to Japanese society or how much impact it has on the future of the Japanese nation, it is certain that those "heroes" who have been influenced by American leg culture and Western movies will only worship the U.S. and will not rebel. As for the "anti-hydrogen bomb," that is obviously not a manifestation of "being obedient," so it must be opposed and destroyed, which goes without saying.

	According to recent reports, juvenile delinquency in Japan has increased significantly in recent years. The number of criminal offenders aged fourteen to under twenty reached 115,000 in 1957, nearly two and a half times that of 1941. Of course, the U.S. intelligence agency has a share of the "credit" in this. However, it is not so easy to let a nation rot from the roots. There are "Sun Tribes" among Japanese youth, but there are also "Olive Tree Clubs," and associated with the latter are thousands upon thousands of kind and peace-loving people. The Japanese people will know how to deal with the positive and negative points given to them by the U.S. intelligence agency. Although some people have done what the U.S. hoped, I am referring not only to the "Sun Tribe" but also to those militarist remnants who, under the pretext of opposing the "Sun Tribe," want to drag Japan back to the old path, and those politicians who verbally oppose the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan but actually assist the U.S. in establishing an atomic strategic system in Japan, the answer from more Japanese people is different. That is to have another "go the other way," turning the U.S.'s so-called negative points into positive points for the Japanese people, increasing it, and increasing it again. That proof is the currently developing, even more massive, movement against the U.S. testing of hydrogen bombs on Eniwetok Island and the struggle to make Japan a nuclear-weapon-free zone.

    正和负
    刘仲平
    美国情报局出版的日本情况调查报告，在去年八月号上有这样两项记载：一项是“太阳族的横行及其道德影响”，一项是“两个原子弹纪念日及其影响”。它以对于美国情报局的活动是否有利为标准，对这两件事情作了一个评价：前者打了八分，后者则打了负八分。一正一负，恰成对照。这倒是艾伦·杜勒斯之流的真情的吐露。
    “太阳族”是战后流行于日本的一个新词。乍听起来，也许会给人一种明朗、愉快的联想，其实它所指的却是阴沟里的角色。这个词来源于一个年轻作者石原慎太郎前年所写的一本小说“太阳的季节”。这部小说描写了一群大学生，他们的生活特点是放荡酗酒，吵架斗殴，他们的精神面貌是厚颜无耻而又冷酷无情。总之，这无非是一批阿飞式的流氓，洋场上的恶少而已。虽然有人认为这部作品文字的芜杂、描写的猥鄙，都是“文学以前”的，但此书一出，竟能造成某种轰动，使“太阳族”一词流行一时，却也反映了日本战后的一种畸形的社会状态。当然，这也不能不引起某些有心人的忧虑。日本不少母亲们就曾忧心忡忡地谈论过怎样保护孩子不受“太阳族”的影响；不少教育家、教授们也曾认真探讨过产生“太阳族”的社会原因。原因也许多种多样吧，但是有一条是他们公认的：那就是美国的诲淫诲盗的小说、电影以及电视影片等等所散布的影响。
    “太阳族”是日本社会的一个溃疮。而这个溃疮是长在青年阶层中间的，这就有从根烂起的危险。美国情报局对于这个溃疮，好像苍蝇见血一样，喜笑颜开，给它打了个正八分，用心何在，也就不言而喻了。
    “两个原子弹纪念日”，是用不着多说什么的。广岛和长崎的两次灾难，不仅是日本人民心灵上永世不能磨灭的创伤，也是全世界善良人们不能忘却的阴暗记忆。在日本已经求和的时候，扔在广岛和长崎的两颗原子弹，许多人已经看到，即不是为了结束战争，而是为了开始一次新的冷战。这次冷战一直继续到现在。虽然美国的原子垄断地位早就丧失了，“实力政策”早已破产了，可是美国的好战之徒还拚命抓住原子弹氢弹不放，就像上吊的人抓住绳套一样。而且他们还想把他们的伙伴的脖子也一道塞进绳套里去，其中当然也包括日本。然而日本人民反对原子弹氢弹的运动，却好似怒涛狂潮，有增无已，美国想把核武器公然运进日本，既不能不有所顾忌，某些当政的日本武士，想接受美国核武器，也不能不有所踌躇。美国情报局对于这个运动，感到有如芒刺在背，不除不快，给它打了个负八分，也是没有什么奇怪的。
    然而这一正一负，却把美国对待日本的真情实意全都抖露出来了。艾伦·杜勒斯干的虽然是肮脏勾当，但比起他的当国务卿的令兄福斯特·杜勒斯来，毕竟坦率一些。那位当国务卿的杜勒斯唱的是什么调子呢？是“共同合作”、反对“共产主义威胁”之类。不仅对日本唱，而且也对美国的其他“伙伴”唱，唱个没完。其实这和老太太吓唬小孩子时所唱的“狼来啦，虎来啦”的调调是一样的，目的是要对方乖乖地听话。他的老弟艾伦·杜勒斯就不绕这些弯子，而是直截了当地说，我喜欢“太阳族”，我讨厌“反氢弹”，当然目的也是一个：要对方乖乖地听话。因为“太阳族”的横行，不管对于日本社会有多大危害，对于日本民族前途有多大影响，但那些从美国大腿文化和西部影片中熏陶出来的“英雄”，对于美国只有崇拜，而不会反叛，却是可以肯定的。至于“反氢弹”，那显然不是“乖乖听话”的表现，所以必须加以反对和破坏，也就不在话下了。
    最近报载：日本青少年犯罪案件近年来大为增加，十四岁以上不到二十周岁的刑事犯1957年已达到十一万五千人，将近1941年的两倍半。这里面当然会有美国情报局的一份“功绩”。不过，想让一个民族从根烂起也不是那么容易的。日本青年中有“太阳族”，但是也有“橄榄树俱乐部”，而同后者相联系的还有千千万万善良的爱好和平的人们。对于美国情报局为他们打的正分和负分，日本人民是会知道怎样对待的。虽然有一部分人照着美国所希望的作了，我指的不仅仅是“太阳族”，而且也包括那些借口反对“太阳族”而想把日本拉回老路的军国主义余孽，和那些口头上反对把核武器运进日本、实际上却协助美国在日本建立原子战略体制的政客，但是更多的日本人的回答却是另一样的。那就是再来一个“反其道而行之”，把美国的所谓负分，变成日本人民的正分，加大它，再加大它。那证明就是现在正在开展的、规模更加浩大的、反对美国在恩纳威托克岛试验氢弹的运动和争取使日本成为无核武器区的斗争。（附图片）
