    Mountain Village Transformed into Water Town
    Xu Qinwen

    I remember when I went to Chengnan District, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province in 1951 to participate in land reform, I met a vice chairman of the farmers' association. It was very cold at the time, and he was only wearing a thin, tattered cotton jacket, constantly shivering. During several conversations, he repeatedly told me: "The land has been distributed, but we still don't have enough to eat. After the land reform is completed, I will have to go to Xiaoshan again to dig for tobacco, and have someone else cultivate the land for me."

    In 1953, I went to Zhuji again and participated in democratic reform in Yaojiang District. A female cadre, after being elected deputy township head, jumped up and down and said, "Now we have enough rice to eat, I don't need to go to Shanghai to work as a nanny anymore, and my husband doesn't need to go out to burn camphor anymore. I am determined to farm well from now on, transplant rice seedlings, harvest rice, and I will definitely do what men can do!"

    This time, I went to Anhua, Tongshan, and other places in Zhuji to see the high tide of production. The cadres I met were generally wearing cotton-padded coats, and I never saw the sallow faces of the farmer association deputy director again. This is the change in the lives of farmers: from poverty to wealth, from being cold and hungry to being well-fed and warmly clothed. In the past seven or eight years, the countryside has indeed undergone great changes.

    The Pujiang River in Zhuji County has always been known as the "Little Yellow River" because the riverbed is higher than the surrounding land, making it prone to flooding. When floods suddenly rush in, they can sweep away the stage, actors, and even the audience. The main purpose of building the Anhua Reservoir is to prevent floods. The project, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, must be completed by the end of April to ensure the bumper harvest of 650,000 mu of farmland and the safety of railway transportation, houses, and lives. Twenty-six kilowatt searchlights were erected, and a three-shift system was implemented, with work continuing non-stop for twenty-four hours. Two thousand migrant workers were carrying and carting, two six-ton cranes were ramming, and the concrete mixing machines were constantly rumbling, the rhythm and intensity of the work were like in a "workshop," transforming the fields in the mountains into factories. Blasting mountain rocks to build the dam, to make the river water winding around Fengjiang Lane flow directly into the culvert of Bishui Ridge, blocking the original river course, truly making high mountains bow their heads and forcing the river to give way.

    In the past, farmers "were born here and grew old here." After the Anhua Reservoir is built, more than 4,000 households will have to move and relocate to other villages and towns to live in order to store water. This is of course because the government has made proper arrangements, building new homes for them and allowing them to participate in local cooperatives; but the main reason is that the nature of the farmers has changed: since the transformation from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, canceling "land shares," and paying members according to their labor, farmers have become collective farmers with a high degree of socialist consciousness. Changing a cooperative is like a worker transferring from one factory to another, so naturally there will be no difficulties.

    Tongshan Township is a mountainous and semi-mountainous area, with many terraced fields. In the past, terraced fields were afraid of drought. People who planted terraced fields depended on the weather, and after years of drought, they had to wander elsewhere to beg for food. The people of Tongshan Township listened to Chairman Mao's words and knew that "water conservancy is the lifeblood of agriculture." Their slogans are: "Transform dry land into paddy fields, one year is equal to three years." "Building reservoirs is like building granaries, storing water is like storing grain." "One year of hard work, ten thousand generations of happiness." They worked day and night: "The moon as a lantern. Two nights equal one day's work," "Stop neither for light snow nor light rain, charge forward in heavy snow and heavy rain." In this township alone, there are eighteen reservoirs that can irrigate from two hundred mu to one thousand mu of land. They also dug more than five hundred mountain manure pits, and many ponds. Some reservoirs guarantee that it doesn't matter if it doesn't rain for sixty days, some guarantee seventy days, and some already guarantee that they are not afraid of more than ninety days of no rain from transplanting to rice ripening. Therefore, the production targets can be set even higher: 1,250 jin, 1,460 jin; Tangren Cooperative has set it at 1,518 jin.

    As we walked in Tongshan Township, we often saw clear green pond water; the trees on the ridges were reflected in the water, the wind blew and the trees moved, and the shadows swayed, as if we were in a water town. But irrigation is even more convenient than in a water town, because in a water village, you still have to draw water in times of drought, but Tongshan Township doesn't even need to spend the effort to draw water anymore, just open the sluice gate, and the rice can get water.

    山乡变水乡
    许钦文
    记得1951年我到浙江诸暨县城南区去参加土地改革时，曾经碰到一位农会副主任。当时很冷，他只穿得一件薄薄的破棉袄，老是索索地发抖。几次谈话，他反复地对我说：“田地分进了，吃的还没有；土地改好以后，我只好再到萧山去刨烟，田托别人代种。”
    1953年我又到诸暨去，在姚江区参加民主改革，一位女干部，当选副乡长以后跳跃着说，“现在吃的米已经有了，我不用再到上海去做娘姨，我的丈夫也不用再出门去烧樟脑。我以后决意好好地种田，插秧，割稻，男人做得到的事情，我一定也做到！”
    这次，我又到诸暨的安华、同山等处去看生产的高潮，碰见的干部大概穿着棉大衣，再也见不到像那位农会副主任菜色的脸孔。这是农民生活的变化；由穷困变为富有，由挨冻挨饿变为饱食暖衣，七、八年来，农村实在已经起了很大的变化。
    诸暨县的浦阳江一向有“小黄河”的名称，因为河床高于平地，容易泛滥；洪水突然冲到，会把戏台、演员连带观众一起卷去。建筑安华水库，主要就是为着防洪的。原定年底完成的工程，为着保障六十五万亩田的丰收和铁路运输、房屋、人命的安全，要提前到4月底完成水坝。架起二十六盏千瓦的探照灯，实行三班制，二十四小时全不停工。两千位民工挑的挑，车的车，两架六吨的起重机在打夯，拌水泥的机轮不绝隆隆地转动，工作的规律和紧张的情况宛如在“车间”，已变山间的田野为工场。轰下山石来作坝，要使绕着枫江弄的江水直接流入避水岭的涵洞，堵塞原有的河道，真是使高山低头，要河水让路的。
    以前农民“生于斯，老于斯。”安华水库筑成以后，为着蓄水，有四千多户要搬家，迁移到别村别乡去住。这固然因为政府安排得法，给他们另筑住所，让他们参加当地的合作社；但主要却是农民的性质已经起了变化的缘故：自从初级社转成高级社，取消“土地股”，社员以劳动得工分；农民都已经成为有高度社会主义觉悟的集体农民。换个合作社，犹如工人从这个工厂转到那个工厂，自然不会为难了。
    同山乡是山区和半山区，许多都是梯田。以前梯田怕旱灾，种梯田的人靠天吃饭，连年旱灾以后只好流浪到别处去讨饭。同山乡人听毛主席的话，知道“水利是农业的命脉。”他们的口号是：“旱田变水田，一年抵三年。”“修库如修仓，积水如积粮。”“一年辛苦，万代幸福。”他们连夜工作：“月亮当灯笼。两夜抵一工，”“小雪小雨不停工，大雪大雨向前冲。”只是这个乡里，可以灌溉两百亩到一千亩田的水库就有十八个。他们还挖了五百多个山茅坑，还有许多个塘。有些水库保证六十天不下雨无妨，有些保证七十天，有的已经保证从插秧到稻熟不怕九十多天无雨了。因此产量的指标可以订得更高：一千二百五十斤，一千四百六十斤；唐仁社一直订到一千五百十八斤。
    我们行在同山乡，时常见到碧油油的塘水；岭上的树木倒影在水中，风吹树动，影子也摇摆，宛然如在水乡。可是灌溉，是比水乡更加便当了，因为水村，旱时还得车水，同山乡已连车水的力气也不用再花，只要放开闸门，就可以使得禾稻得水了。
