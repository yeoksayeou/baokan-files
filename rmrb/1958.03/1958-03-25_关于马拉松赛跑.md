    About the Marathon Race
    隋集
    The Origin of the Marathon Race
    In 490 BC, Persia sent troops to invade Greece, attempting to occupy Athens. Near Athens, in a place called Marathon, the Greek army encountered the Persian army and completely annihilated it, preserving Athens. In order to urgently report the news of the victory over Persia to the residents of Athens, to prevent them from being worried, a warrior who was once a champion of the Olympic Games in ancient Greece, carrying the news of victory, ran from the battlefield of Marathon to the central square of Athens in one breath, shouting: "Rejoice, everyone, we have won!" and announced the victory over Persia to the people of Athens.
    In 1894, when a meeting was held in Paris, France, to discuss the restoration of the Olympic Games, the Greek representative proposed adding the Marathon Championship to the modern Olympic Games to commemorate the warrior who ran from Marathon to Athens and to promote the Olympic spirit. Thus, the marathon race became an event in the competition.
    How Long is the Marathon Race?
    At the end of the nineteenth century, people measured the distance from Marathon to Athens, which was 40 kilometers and 200 meters. In 1896, at the first Olympic Games, a competition was held over this distance, and the winner completed the distance in two hours, fifty-five minutes, and twenty seconds. In 1920, a precise measurement of the distance from Marathon to Athens was carried out again, and it was finally determined to be 42 kilometers and 195 meters. Now all countries hold marathon races at this distance of 42 kilometers and 195 meters.
    Some Rules of the Marathon Race
    Marathon races can be held on roads or roads similar to highways, but the start and finish points must be set on the athletic field's running track. Mileage markers are set up every kilometer along the race route to let athletes know the distance. Athletes participating in the competition can drink beverages during the race. The first drink station is set up 15 kilometers from the starting point, and then every five kilometers thereafter.
    China's First Marathon Race Record
    Before liberation, marathon races were never held in our country. After liberation, this event was not held in any of the national track and field games. Last December, in the marathon test race held by the Anhui Provincial Sports Commission, Zhang Liangyou, a worker from the Xie Er Mine in the Huainan Mining Area, completed the entire course in two hours, fifty-two minutes, thirty-four and six-tenths seconds, setting China's first national record for the marathon race.

    关于马拉松赛跑
    隋集
    马拉松赛跑的起源
    在公元前四九○年的时候，波斯派兵入侵希腊，企图占领雅典。在雅典附近一个叫做马拉松的地方，希腊军队同波斯军队遭遇，结果把波斯军队全部消灭，保全了雅典。为了要把战胜波斯的消息急于报告给雅典居民，以免他们耽惊受怕，一个曾是古希腊时代的奥林匹克运动会冠军的战士，带着胜利的消息，从战地马拉松一口气跑到雅典中央广场，高呼：“大家欢乐吧，我们胜利了！”向雅典人民宣告对波斯的胜利。
    1894年，在法国巴黎召开会议商量恢复奥林匹克运动会的时候，希腊代表提出，在近代奥林匹克运动会中加上马拉松锦标赛的项目，以纪念那位从马拉松跑到雅典的战士，并以发扬奥林匹克的精神。于是马拉松赛跑成了竞赛中的一个项目。
    马拉松赛跑的距离有多长
    在十九世纪末叶，人们对从马拉松到雅典的路程进行了测量，长度为四十公里二百公尺。1896年在第一次奥林匹克运动会上，举行了这一距离的竞赛，优胜者以二时五十五分二十秒跑完了这段距离。1920年，对马拉松到雅典这段距离又进行了精确的测量，最后确定为四十二公里一百九十五公尺。现在各国举行马拉松跑都是四十二公里一百九十五公尺这个距离。
    马拉松赛跑的一些规则
    马拉松赛跑可以在公路上或近似公路的道路上举行，不过它的起点和终点一定要设在田径运动场的竞赛跑道上。赛跑的沿途每公里都设有里程碑，好让运动员知道距离的远近。参加比赛的运动员可以在赛跑中途喝饮料。第一个饮料站设在距起点十五公里处，以后每五公里设置一处。
    我国第一个马拉松赛跑纪录
    解放前，在我国根本没有举行过马拉松赛跑。解放后，历次全国性田径运动会中，也没有举行过这个项目。去年12月，在安徽省体委举行的马拉松测验赛中，淮南矿区谢二矿的工人张亮友，以二时五十二分三十四秒六的时间，跑完了全程，创下了我国马拉松赛跑的第一个全国最高纪录。
