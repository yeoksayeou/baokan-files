    Challenging Qingdao Municipality to a Friendship Competition
    Lüda Aims to Become a City of "Six No's and Six Cleans" This Year

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang, 28th) The beautiful city of Lüda will become a clean and civilized city free of the Four Pests this year. Currently, the people of the entire city have basically eliminated mosquitoes and flies. Thirty-eight streets, nine townships, and forty-two units have cleared away three or four of the pests. Based on the directives from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council regarding the elimination of the Four Pests and emphasizing hygiene, the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully estimated the growing enthusiasm of the broad masses of the city for eliminating the Four Pests. At a recent expanded meeting of the Municipal Committee, it was decided to revise the original plan of eliminating the Four Pests within three years, proposing to turn the entire city into a city of "Six No's and Six Cleans" within this year. Furthermore, a challenge was issued to Qingdao Municipality, a national sanitation model city in 1952, for a friendship competition. The Lüda Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has sent a visiting group to Qingdao Municipality to learn from their experience in eliminating the Four Pests and emphasizing hygiene. In recent days, the atmosphere of fighting the Four Pests and clearing garbage has been extremely intense throughout the city. Every household and every street corner is discussing methods for catching rats and sparrows. Some residents who had only managed to catch one rat with great difficulty over several days said happily, "Little rat! See where you can run now, I'll catch you anyway!" City Party, government, and military leaders are constantly concerned about the achievements of the sanitation campaign, personally inspecting and summarizing the experiences of the sanitation campaign. All units within the city, districts between districts, and streets between streets are engaging in mutual competitions, vying for advancement. Some conduct evaluations once a week, others every ten days or a month. Many factory workers, after getting off work, also engage in sanitation at home, catching rats, saying, "Our worker families must take the lead and must not lag behind the residents." The number of people in the city involved in the Four Pests elimination and hygiene campaign regularly remains above 820,000. Many districts and streets are preparing to achieve "Six No's and Six Cleans" within six or seven months. Some residential areas aim to eliminate the Four Pests within one month.

    向青岛市提出友谊竞赛挑战
    旅大今年要变成六无六净城市
    本报沈阳28日电　美丽的旅大市今年将要变成一座没有四害的清洁的文明城市。现在全市人民已经基本上消灭了蚊蝇，三十八条街、九个乡镇和四十二个单位都清除了三害或四害。中共旅大市委根据中共中央和国务院关于除四害讲卫生的指示，充分估计了全市广大群众除四害的日益增长的干劲，在最近的一次市委扩大会议上决定修改原订三年内消灭四害的计划，提出在今年内把全市变成六无六净的城市，并且还向1952年全国卫生模范城市——青岛市提出友谊竞赛的挑战。旅大市爱国卫生运动委员会已派出参观团，到青岛市学习除四害讲卫生的经验。这几天来，全市除四害清垃圾的战斗气氛万分浓厚。家家户户、街头巷尾都在谈论着捉老鼠打麻雀的方法。有些居民几天之内才好容易捉到一只老鼠，却高兴地说道：“鼠崽子！看你往那跑，我也要抓着你。”全市党政军负责人时刻都在关心卫生运动的战果，亲自检查和总结卫生运动的经验。全市各单位之间、区与区之间、街道与街道之间，都互相展开竞赛，比先进，有的一星期评比一次，有的十天或一个月评比一次。许多工厂职工下班以后，回家也要搞卫生，捉老鼠，他们说：“咱们工人家庭要带头，决不能落在居民之后。”全市投入除四害讲卫生运动的人数，经常保持在八十二万以上。许多区和街道准备在六、七个月内做到六无六净。有些居民区要在一个月内除尽四害。
