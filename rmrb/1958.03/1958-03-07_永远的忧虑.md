　　Eternal Worry
　　Recently, Washington diplomatic authorities again "expressed deep concern" about Indonesia's decision last winter to announce its territorial sea limits. It is said that if this decision can be realized, it would be tantamount to setting up a three-thousand-mile "barrier" across the South Pacific between Australia and New Zealand and other countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
　　According to this American logic, it seems that Indonesia has only two options: one is to abandon its independent sovereignty and willingly act as a "thoroughfare" from Australia and New Zealand to other Manila Treaty countries; the other is to move! If it is unwilling to take either of these paths, then it is sincerely "hindering" the United States, causing the United States to "worry."
　　But the United States is thinking too naively. Indonesia is a sovereign country, and the Indonesian government certainly has the right to take any decision to safeguard its sovereignty. Whether the United States is happy or not, Indonesia's territory will forever "span three thousand miles across the South Pacific." If the United States feels "deeply concerned" about this, then it will just have to worry about it forever.

### 永远的忧虑

    永远的忧虑
    最近，华盛顿外交当局又对印度尼西亚在去冬宣布的领海范围决定“感到深切的忧虑”。据说，这个决定如果能够实现，就不啻在澳大利亚和新西兰同东南亚条约组织其他国家之间；设下一道横跨南太平洋的三千英里的“壁垒”。
    按照美国的这种逻辑，似乎印度尼西亚只有两条出路：一条就是放弃自己的独立主权，甘愿充当从澳大利亚、新西兰到其他马尼拉条约国家的“甬路”；另一条就是搬家！如果这两条路都不愿意走，那就是诚心“妨碍”美国，以致引起美国的“忧虑”。
    但是美国未免想得太天真了。印度尼西亚是个主权国家，印度尼西亚政府当然有权采取维护自己主权的任何决定。不管美国高兴不高兴，印度尼西亚的国土毕竟永远要“横跨南太平洋的三千英里”。如果美国对此感到“深切的忧虑”，那么就只好请它永远地忧虑下去吧。
