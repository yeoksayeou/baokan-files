    Great Social Changes, People's Hearts Soar Upward
    Lagging Workers at Changxindian Railway Vehicle Repair Factory Transform into Advanced Workers

    (Our report) After the Changxindian Railway Vehicle Repair Factory organized its employees to discuss "For Whom Do We Labor?", many lagging workers transformed, and some have already become advanced workers.

    Recently, the Beijing Municipal Trade Union investigated the transformation of eight lagging workers into advanced workers. These eight workers are: Fu Zhenbo from the boiler workshop, Zhang Zhensheng and Han Zheng from the locomotive workshop, Liu Shiwen and Li Ben from the passenger car workshop, Liu Zhenhai and Wei Yintang from the forging workshop, and Li Yinhe from the wheel workshop. This investigative material analyzes why some workers lagged behind and how they transformed.

    These eight individuals were originally well-known "problem cases" in their workshops or the entire factory. In labor, they "dragged their feet on time-based work and rushed during piecework." For example, when making container wooden boards, ordinary workers would make at least twelve or thirteen pieces a day, but Liu Shiwen only made five or six pieces and then wandered around. Li Yinhe, in order to earn more piecework wages, desperately sped up the lathe, disregarding product quality and lathe lifespan, and was given two major demerits for damaging the lathe and causing defective products. When Fu Zhenbo made coal-water car water tanks, 90% of the disassembled old materials could be used, but in order to speed up, he used all new materials. Liu Shiwen was antagonistic towards the foreman and team leader, refused to obey assignments, and frequently cursed in the streets. They did not participate in political activities or meetings because "meetings don't pay," and "attending or not attending meetings, you get the same wages." Sometimes, the trade union group leader would pull them to listen to reports, but they would slip away halfway through.

    Five of these eight individuals are veteran workers who suffered cruel exploitation and oppression from Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang before liberation. Among the remaining three new workers, one is a worker by birth, and two also came from working people's families. After liberation, the social status of the working class improved, and their lives also greatly improved. They basically supported the Communist Party and the new society. However, why were they so backward for so long?

    The most fundamental reason is low political consciousness. They universally believed that "working is just for earning money." Once, during a discussion on reducing work-hour quotas, Zhang Zhensheng said: "All I know is to get more money. No one is happy to get two yuan less. I crawl under the car to work, covered in oil. What for? Isn't it just to get two more yuan!" Fu Zhenbo also said: "I came to the factory as a worker in the past just for money. I don't understand anything about being the master or the leading class. If you give me money, I'll work for you." Because they divorced themselves from politics and were unwilling to approach Party members, League members, and progressive workers, they became increasingly backward. It is particularly noteworthy that some of these lagging workers did not start out backward but later became backward elements. This is related to the simple work methods, rigid style, and even incorrect attitudes of some cadres towards the workers. For example, Li Yinhe was very active in his work in the early days after liberation and was rated as a Beijing model worker in 1954. Later, the leadership found that he only cared about earning excess wages on piecework and that the product quality was poor, but they did not educate or help him. In April 1955, the Ministry of Railways held a national labor model conference in this factory. Li Yinhe was one of the representatives, but in the end, he was not allowed to participate, and no reason was given to him. After the meeting, a labor model from the Harbin Railway Vehicle Repair Factory gave an operating demonstration on his lathe. The leadership asked him to watch the lathe and hand over tools. He angrily left the lathe at that time. From then on, his emotions plummeted, his work became sluggish, and he frequently clashed with the leadership. Another example is Liu Shiwen. When he first came to the factory in 1955, he was active in his work and had a good relationship with the veteran workers. Once, the team leader assigned tasks unreasonably, and he raised his opinion. The team leader not only did not accept it but also criticized him. Later, the work area leadership considered him a "backward element" and transferred his work like a football, transferring him thirteen times in two years and two months. When transferring his work, they did not solicit his opinion and sometimes did not even notify him, so he could not find a place to collect his wages. He believed that this was the leadership's "retaliation" against him and felt that "his life was over." Therefore, he would loaf around at work whenever possible and deliberately make things difficult for the leadership.

    During the rectification movement, especially after the discussion of "For Whom Do We Labor?", the thinking of lagging workers underwent profound changes. During the period of great airing of views and debates, they had great concerns and did not believe that the rectification movement could solve problems. They had many opinions about the leadership, but they dared not raise them, fearing that the leadership would give them trouble. They saw that many big-character posters criticized the workers' erroneous thinking. Although they began to realize their mistakes and shortcomings, they lacked the courage and determination to correct them. The leadership promptly handled more than 25,000 opinions raised by the employees in the airing of views and debates, and five inspections were carried out to assess the effect of the rectification. This made a deep impression on the lagging workers. Li Yinhe said after the great rectification and transformation: "The leading cadres are so boldly admitting their mistakes and correcting their shortcomings. This is the first time I have seen this in several societies!"

    The Party Central Committee put forward the call to catch up with Britain in about fifteen years in terms of the output of steel and other important industrial products, as well as the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, which moved their hearts. Seeing the farmers' revolutionary spirit was so full, they said: "Workers are the elder brothers and must not let the farmers leave us behind!" Liu Zhenhai used to get entangled in personal life issues and was listless in his work. After hearing the report on catching up with Britain in fifteen years, he said: "If everyone is like me, how can we catch up?" A high tide of comparing progress and comparing vigor swept the factory, and the slogan "Everyone strives to be advanced" resounded throughout the factory. They began to ask themselves: "Others can be advanced, why can't I be advanced?"

    After listening to the mobilization report on the discussion of "For Whom Do We Labor?", they were very excited and checked themselves one after another. Fu Zhenbo revealed all his behaviors of cheating in piecework wages. Zhang Zhensheng confessed: "Everyone is for socialism, am I for myself—just dealing with money?" Through this discussion, they realized that labor is for socialism, socialism is the greatest interest of the working class, and the idea of only caring about earning more money is wrong. They also examined the mistakes of not participating in political activities in the past, and the conclusion was: If you do not participate in political study, you will fall behind.

    After these workers' thinking changed, their production immediately changed, and everyone set competition conditions. Liu Shiwen proposed to catch up with Wang Chunming, an advanced producer in the entire factory. Now he is full of energy, and the number of container boards he repairs has increased from 30 to 70 per day, and the quality is also very good. Li Yinhe wanted to compete with Zhang Jinming, a Beijing model worker in the factory, and created a workload of 19 hours and 30 minutes in 12 hours, surpassing Zhang Jinming again. Li Ben, a third-grade worker, competed with Liu Deyuan, a fifth-grade worker. When doing scribing work, he was more than twice as fast as Liu Deyuan's highest record of scribing eight axle boxes in one day.

    The transformation of the lagging workers promoted the middle, and stimulated the advanced. For example, after the news that Li Yinhe had surpassed Zhang Jinming spread, it caused a sensation throughout the factory, and Zhang Jinming set new and higher conditions to challenge Li Yinhe. The work area where Zhang Jinming is located is an advanced unit. Seeing that Li Yinhe had surpassed Zhang Jinming, they immediately sounded the battle drum, guaranteeing to exceed the quota by 30%. Li Yinhe accepted the challenge again. Under the leadership of Li Yinhe, his work area was mobilized.

    社会大变动　人心向上
    长辛店机车车辆修理厂落后工人变先进
    本报讯　长辛店机车车辆修理工厂组织职工讨论“为谁劳动”后，许多落后工人纷纷转变，其中有一部分已经成为先进工人。
    最近，北京市工会调查了八个落后工人转变为先进工人的情况。这八个工人是：锅炉车间的傅振波，机车车间的张振声、韩正，客车车间的刘士文、李本，锻工车间的刘振海、魏印堂，车轮车间的李印和。这个调查材料分析了有些工人为什么落后以及怎样转变的。
    这八个人原来都是车间或全厂有名的“落后疙瘩”。在劳动上“计时磨洋工，计件打冲锋”。例如作集装箱木板，一般工人起码每天作十二、三块，刘士文只作五、六块，作完了就到处蹓躂。李印和为了多得计件工资，拚命加快车速，不顾产品质量和车床寿命，曾因损坏车床和废品事故，被记大过两次。傅振波为了多得计件工资，作煤水车水箱时，拆下来的旧料有90％可以用，可是他为了赶速度，全部用新料。刘士文和工长、领工员闹对立，不服从分配，经常骂大街。他们不参加政治活动，不参加会议，因为“开会不给钱”，“开会不开会一样拿工资”。有时工会小组长拉他们去听报告，听到半截就蹓了。
    这八个人中有五个是老工人，他们在解放前受过日本帝国主义和国民党残酷的剥削和压迫。其余三个新工人中，有一个是血统工人，两个也出身于劳动人民家庭。解放后，工人阶级的社会地位提高了，生活也有很大的改善，他们对共产党和新社会基本上是拥护的。但是，为什么他们长期这样落后呢？
    最根本的原因是政治觉悟低。他们普遍认为“干活就是为了挣钱。”有一次讨论压缩工时定额，张振声说：“我就知道多拿点钱，少给两块钱谁也不乐意，我爬在车底下干活，满身是油，为了什么？还不是为了多拿两块钱！”傅振波也说：“我过去来厂当工人就是为了钱，什么主人翁、领导阶级，我全不懂，你给我钱我就给你干。”由于他们脱离政治，不愿接近党团员和进步工人，就变得越来越落后。特别值得注意的是，在这些落后工人中，有些人开始并不落后，后来成了落后分子。这与某些干部的工作方法简单、作风生硬，甚至用错误的态度对待工人有关。例如李印和，解放初期工作很积极，1954年曾被评为北京市劳动模范。后来领导上发现他作计件活时只顾超额多得工资，产品质量不好，但是，没有对他进行教育和帮助。1955年4月，铁道部在这个厂召开全国劳动模范大会，李印和是代表之一，但最后没有让他参加，也没有跟他说明原因。会后，哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂的劳动模范在他的车床上作操作表演，领导上让他给看床子，拿工具，他当时就气愤地离开了车床。从那时起，他的情绪一落千丈，工作疲沓，经常和领导闹对立。又如刘士文，1955年刚来厂的时候，工作积极，跟老师傅关系也很好。有一次领工员分配任务不合理，他提出意见，领工员不但不接受，还把他批评了一顿。以后，工区领导上便认为他是“落后分子”，踢皮球式地调动他的工作，在两年零两个月中，调动了十三次工作。在调动工作的时候，不征求他的意见，有时甚至不通知他，弄得他找不到领工资的地方。他认为这是领导上对他“打击报复”，感到“这辈子完啦”。因此，在工作上能泡的就泡，故意和领导为难。
    整风运动中，特别是经过“为谁劳动”的讨论，落后工人的思想发生了深刻的变化。在大鸣大放时期，他们的顾虑很大，不相信整风运动能解决问题。他们对领导上有不少意见，但是不敢提，怕领导上给穿小鞋。他们看见不少大字报是批评工人的错误思想的，虽然开始觉察自己的错误和缺点，但缺乏改正错误的勇气和决心。职工在鸣放中提出的二万五千多条意见，领导上都及时处理了，并对整改效果进行了五次检查。这给落后工人的印象极深。李印和在大整大改以后说：“领导干部这样大胆承认错误，改正缺点，我经过几个社会，这是头一回！”
    党中央提出在钢铁和其它重要工业产品产量方面，十五年左右赶上英国的号召，以及工农业生产大跃进的新形势，打动了他们的心。看到农民的革命干劲那么足，他们说：“工人是老大哥，不能让农民把我们甩在后面！”刘振海过去老纠缠个人生活问题，工作无精打采，听了十五年赶上英国的报告后说：“要是大家都像我，怎么赶得上呀？”全厂掀起比先进、比干劲的高潮，“人人争取作先进”的口号响彻全厂，他们开始反问自己：“人家能先进，难道我就不能先进？” 
    听了讨论“为谁劳动”的动员报告后，他们非常激动，纷纷检查自己。傅振波把他在计件工资中捣鬼的行为全都揭发出来了。张振声检讨说：“人人都为社会主义，难道我为自己——就和钱干上了？”通过这次讨论，使他们认识到劳动是为了社会主义，社会主义是工人阶级的最大利益，只顾自己多挣钱的思想是错误的。他们还检查了过去不参加政治活动的错误，得出的结论是：不参加政治学习就要落后。
    这些工人思想转变了以后，生产上马上变了样，个个订出了竞赛条件。刘士文提出要赶过全厂先进生产者王春明。现在他的干劲十足，修制集装箱板由每天三十扇提高到七十扇，质量也很好。李印和要同本厂的北京市劳动模范张金铭比干劲，创造了十二小时完成十九小时三十分的工作量，又超过了张金铭。三级工李本和五级工刘德远比，作划线活时，比刘德远一天最高纪录划八个轴箱还快一倍多。
    落后工人的转变，推动了中间，又刺激了先进。如李印和赶过张金铭的消息传出后，轰动了全厂，张金铭又订出新的更高的条件向李印和应战。张金铭所在的工区是个先进单位，看到李印和赶过了张金铭，立即敲起战鼓，保证超过定额30％。李印和又应了战。在李印和的带动下，他所在的工区都发动起来了。
