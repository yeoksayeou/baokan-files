Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 11th: The National Publishing Work Great Leap Forward Conference began in Shanghai on the 10th.

Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, said at the meeting: This conference is an "on-site meeting." Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai publishing industry has created many successful experiences in carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign in the publishing industry and has achieved great results. Now, the leaders of the Ministry of Culture and the publishing industry from all over the country have come to Shanghai to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and compare with the advanced. This is of great significance to promoting the Great Leap Forward in the national publishing work. Qian Junrui pointed out that publishing work must cooperate with the spirit of the all-round Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the country and also have a Great Leap Forward. To realize the Great Leap Forward in the publishing industry, the first thing to do is to push the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement that has already been launched to a complete victory.

Luo Zhufeng, the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Publishing Bureau, introduced the situation of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign in the Shanghai publishing industry at the meeting. He said: More than 600,000 big-character posters published by the Shanghai publishing industry are like a raging fire, burning away many old rules and regulations in publishing work. The number of new book varieties published by Shanghai publishing houses this year has leapt from the original 2,791 to 4,006, and the number of books published this year has increased from more than 270 million to 349 million. He said that at present, Shanghai publishing houses are carrying out major rectification and major reforms, focusing on studying and solving how to publish more books, publish good books, run publishing houses openly, run publishing houses diligently and thriftily, and strengthen publishing planning. At the same time, they are making personal "both red and expert" plans.

On the morning of the 10th, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, Chen Kehan, and the heads of publishing houses from the central government and various provinces and cities who participated in the meeting visited the big-character posters in various publishing houses in Shanghai.

    反掉清规戒律　出版更多好书
    出版界在上海开现场会议
    新华社上海11日电　全国出版工作跃进会议10日起在上海举行。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在会上说：这次会议是一个“现场会议”。上海出版界在中共上海市委的领导下，创造了出版事业开展反浪费反保守运动的许多成功经验，取得很大成绩。现在文化部和全国各地出版界的领导人都到上海来学先进、赶先进、比先进，这对推动全国出版工作的大跃进有很大意义。钱俊瑞指出：出版工作必须配合全国各个方面全面大跃进的精神，也来个大跃进。要实现出版事业的大跃进，首先必须把已经开展了的反浪费反保守运动推向彻底的胜利。
    上海市出版局负责人罗竹风在会上介绍了上海出版界开展反浪费反保守运动的情况。他说：上海出版界出的六十多万张大字报，如一团烈火，烧掉了许多出版工作中的清规戒律。上海各个出版社今年的新书品种，已由原来的二千七百九十一种跃进到四千零六种，今年出书册数由二亿七千多万册增加到三亿四千九百万册。他说，目前上海各出版社正在大整大改，着重研究解决如何多出书、出好书、开门办社、勤俭办社和加强出版计划性等问题，同时订出个人的“又红又专”规划。
    10日上午，文化部副部长钱俊瑞、陈克寒和参加会议的中央及各省市出版社的负责人等，到上海各个出版社参观了大字报。
    新华书店第四次分店经理会议10日也在上海召开，参加会议的人员当天下午都出席了全国出版工作跃进会议的第一次会议。
