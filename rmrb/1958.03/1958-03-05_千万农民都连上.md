    Tens of Millions of Peasants are United
      (Zhuang Folk Song)
  Tens of millions of peasants are united
  Clear streams surround the village,
  Winding paths connect the whole township,
  There is only one road to cooperation,
  Tens of millions of peasants are united.First be a Good Commune Member
  Peanuts grow in the garden,
  The girl stands before thousands,
  To pick flowers, first enter the garden,
  To woo the girl, first be a good commune member.Golden Flowers Roll Down
  The mountain gushes mountain torrents,
  Like a white jade belt,
  Wandering and flowing year after year,
  No one stopped it for a thousand years.After the advanced cooperative was established, a dam was built to stop the water,the mountain torrents were stopped, and the poor mountain became a rich mountain.The mountain gushes mountain torrents,flowing out gold and silver,golden flowers roll down,silver flowers roll down.

    千万农民都连上
      （僮族山歌）千万农民都连上
  清清溪水绕村庄，
  曲曲弯弯连全乡，
  合作大道只一条，
  千万农民都连上。先当好社员
  桂花生在园里边，
  妹妹站在万人前，
  摘花先要把园进，
  恋妹先当好社员。金花滚下来
  山出山冲水，
  像条白玉带，
  年年流浪走，千年无人拦。转了高级社，修堤把水拦，拦了山冲水，穷山变富山。山出山冲水，流出金银来，金花滚下来，银花滚下来。
