    China Successfully Cultivates First Batch of Artificially Bred Sea Cucumbers

    Walking along the Beidaihe coast, people can see the first batch of artificially cultivated *Apostichopus japonicus* (刺参) seedlings growing. This work was carried out by the Hebei Provincial Marine Fisheries Experimental Farm in cooperation with the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of echinoderm zoologist Zhang Fengying.

    China discovered that sea cucumbers were a delicious food hundreds of years ago. It contains a large amount of protein, which is analyzed to reach 76.5%. It can not only be eaten, but also used in medicine to treat women's diseases, ulcers, and rashes in children. However, the annual output of sea cucumbers in China is very small, which cannot meet the needs of all aspects. For decades, a large number of sea cucumbers have been imported from foreign countries every year.

    *Apostichopus japonicus* is the best quality of the more than 20 kinds of edible sea cucumbers found along the coast of China. In order to meet the needs, the Hebei Provincial Marine Fisheries Experimental Farm began artificial cultivation of *Apostichopus japonicus* in 1954. In 1957, in order to cultivate a large number of small *Apostichopus japonicus* as seedlings to be released into the sea for breeding, they built a breeding pond between the high and low tide lines in Taiping Bay on the coast of Beidaihe. They first raised the larvae of *Apostichopus japonicus*, which were cultivated by artificial fertilization and artificial constant-temperature induced ovulation fertilization methods, indoors for a period of time, and then put them into the pond for rearing after they developed into large auricularia larvae.

    Now you can see a lot of small *Apostichopus japonicus* growing in the pond. The large ones are four or five centimeters long, the general ones are two or three centimeters, and the small ones are one centimeter. This batch of small *Apostichopus japonicus* will soon be released as the first batch of seedlings in China to the Beidaihe coastal breeding area or transported to other breeding areas for breeding.

### 我国第一批用人工培殖海参成功

    我国第一批用人工培殖海参成功
    走到北戴河海滨，人们可以看到我国第一批用人工方法培殖成功的刺参幼苗正在成长。这项工作是河北省海洋水产试验场同中国科学院海洋生物研究所合作，在棘皮动物学家张凤瀛指导下进行的。
    我国在几百年以前已经发现海参是一种美味的食品。它含有大量的蛋白质，据分析达到76.5％。它不但可以吃，同时它在医药方面可以治妇女病、溃疡、小孩生疹子等。但是我国每年出产的海参很少，不能满足各方面的需要，几十年来每年都从国外进口大量的海参。
    刺参是我国沿海所发现的二十多种能供食用的海参中品质最好的一种。为了适应需要，河北省海洋水产试验场从1954年开始进行刺参的人工培殖工作。1957年为了培养大量的小刺参作为参苗投放到海内进行养殖，他们在北戴河海滨太平湾内就高低潮线间修建了一个饲养池。他们把用人工受精方法和人工定温诱导排卵受精方法培养出来的刺参幼体先在室内饲养一个阶段，待发育成大形的耳状幼体再放进池内养育。
    现在可以看到池内长出很多小刺参，大的体长达到四、五厘米，一般的二、三厘米，小的也有一厘米。这批小刺参即将作为我国第一批参苗投放到北戴河海滨养殖区或者运往其他的养殖区养殖。
