　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th - The meeting to criticize Chen Yi, the former Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department and a rightist element within the Party, convened by the Party Committee of the General Political Department, began on November 13, 1957, and concluded on February 12th of this year after 25 sessions. The large number of facts revealed at the conference proved that Chen Yi was a rightist element within the Party who committed serious crimes against the Party and socialism, an extremely despicable bourgeois individualist careerist, and a thorough double-dealer and opportunist. Thoroughly exposing the true face of Chen Yi, this fake leftist and real rightist, is a major victory on the anti-rightist struggle front of the General Political Department.

　　In May 1957, just as the bourgeois rightists were taking advantage of our Party's rectification campaign to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, Chen Yi seized the opportunity to shed his "leftist" disguise. In Tianjin, Jinzhou, and other places, he continuously made anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, openly standing on the same front as the bourgeois rightists to launch an attack on the Party, becoming a powerful internal accomplice of the bourgeois rightists within our Party.

　　He denied class struggle, advocated the abolition of dictatorship, and believed that many aspects of the socialist system were worth studying. He proposed that we should learn from bourgeois democracy.

　　Chen Yi did his utmost to promote the theory of the dying out of class struggle and opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said, "There are only one in ten thousand counter-revolutionaries left," and even among them, there were landlords and bad elements under control. He said: "Today, family background is no longer a problem, because they have all been reformed." He believed that no one wanted to oppose the Communist Party anymore. Therefore, he believed that since class contradictions no longer existed, class struggle could be abolished, and there was no need for dictatorship.

　　He openly attacked our country's socialist system. He said that there were still many aspects of our social system that were worth studying, and he also said that socialism might also change dynasties like feudal dynasties. He slandered the new countryside after agricultural cooperativization, believing that, due to agricultural cooperativization, soldiers had fallen into the tragic situation of "having no hometown to return to when they retire, and having no land to return to when they disarm." He also tried his best to praise bourgeois democracy, proposing to learn from bourgeois democracy.

　　He believed that there was a wall between the Party and the people, and incited people to use a "storm" to knock down this wall. He took advantage of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend to attack the Party. He attributed all contradictions to the contradictions between the Party and the people, and believed that the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," and correctly handling contradictions among the people, was proposed under duress. He said: "The contradictions among the people are the contradictions between the Party and the people," "There is now a wall between our Party and the people," therefore, he incited people to rise up and use a "storm" to knock down this wall.

　　He slandered the army as being completely divorced from the masses of the people, and he falsely claimed that dogmatism dominated everything in the army.

　　In addition to continuously making the above-mentioned anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary remarks, Chen Yi also used despicable means of distorting, fabricating, exaggerating, and exaggerating to slander and attack the Chinese People's Liberation Army and its leading organs. He slandered the army for not daring to implement the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," and correctly handling contradictions among the people. He slandered the army as being completely divorced from the masses of the people. He slandered the army as having no democratic atmosphere. He slandered the army as being full of dogmatism everywhere, and that dogmatism had dominated everything. In Chen Yi's view, the army was pitch black and full of contradictions; the bureaucracy of the army's leading organs had reached an intolerable level.

　　During the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, Chen Yi gave encouragement and support to those who attacked the Party and army leaders in many ways, and exonerated them. He supported and praised the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Diary of a Madman" written by a rightist element at Tianjin Normal College; he supported the "Fellowship Paper" that some rightist elements at the college were preparing to found, and wanted the college to provide money to support it.

　　Chen Yi's criminal activities against the Party and socialism were by no means accidental. This was the inevitable result of the malignant development of his bourgeois individualism, and it was also a continuation of his long-term anti-Party and anti-leadership activities.

　　He regarded the Cultural Department he led as an independent kingdom, only allowing him to ask the Party and superiors for people and money, and not allowing the Party and superiors to supervise and inspect his work.

　　During his tenure as Director of the General Political Department's Cultural Department, his extremely bad bourgeois individualist ideology and work style were quite prominent, and he was constantly severely criticized by the leadership of the General Political Department. He had no regard for organization, no regard for leadership, and was self-centered. He regarded the Cultural Department he led as an independent kingdom, as a tool for him to compete for fame and gain, only allowing him to ask the Party and superiors for support, people, and money, and not allowing the Party and superiors to supervise and criticize his work. He attributed all the achievements made by the army's cultural work over a long period of time under the leadership of the Party and the joint efforts of all the army's cultural cadres to himself, and this became the capital for him to flaunt himself and fight against the Party. He privately appointed more than a dozen school-level officers without organizational approval. He adopted an extremely bad attitude of resistance to the General Political Department's several inspections of the Cultural Department's work. His theory was: "Only by 'resisting' and 'opposing' can problems be solved." In the spring of 1957, the Military Commission decided to merge the General Political Department's Cultural Department with the Propaganda Department. He believed that this had eliminated the independent kingdom he used to develop his personal power and fame, and he was greatly dissatisfied. First, he opposed it, then he undermined it, and carried out a series of anti-Party and divisive activities. He tried every means to spread the mood of breaking up everywhere, encouraging cultural work cadres to leave the army, attempting to dismantle the army's literary and artistic work, in order to prove that the army could not do anything in literary and artistic work without him, this "literary and artistic leader."

　　Inside the army, he used "literary and artistic characteristics" to confront the leadership, and outside the army, he regarded himself as a "force to be reckoned with" with "army characteristics," attempting to compete with the Party's entire literary and artistic work.

　　In terms of literary and artistic work, although he verbally supported the Party's literary and artistic line, in his actual work, he tried his best to break away from the Party's leadership and from the reality of the army, and resisted the Party's literary and artistic line. He strongly emphasized the particularity of literature and art, demanding that all work "should be to ensure the success of artistic work." He one-sidedly emphasized professional improvement, and instilled the idea of personal fame and success in a large number of literary and artistic cadres. He did not understand academic issues, but he insisted on pretending to be an expert, making a show of himself, and talking nonsense. Inside the army, he used "literary and artistic characteristics" to confront the leadership; while outside the army, he regarded himself as a "force to be reckoned with" with "army characteristics," attempting to compete with the Party's entire literary and artistic work.

　　He was hypocritical, treacherous, and played tricks and double-dealing tactics against the Party and his comrades, and his moral character was shockingly degenerate.

　　The degeneration of Chen Yi's moral character had reached an unbelievable level. He was hypocritical, treacherous, and played tricks and double-dealing tactics against the Party and his comrades. He was accustomed to pulling and tugging, flattering and patting. Whoever obeyed him, he regarded as his confidant, and promised him official positions; whoever offended a little of his personal interests and dignity, he hated him to the bone, and tried every means to attack and retaliate, even to the point of political persecution. He did not hesitate to sow discord among cadres and create contradictions, so that he could gain favor and trust from them. In order to win over cadres and buy people's hearts, he portrayed himself as the leader who cared most about cadres. He made promises to cadres' requests, regardless of whether they were reasonable or not. When the leadership reviewed and did not approve, he pushed the responsibility onto the leadership, on the one hand, maliciously instigating the cadres; on the other hand, he pretended to be the representative of public opinion and confronted the leadership. In order to elevate himself and attack the leadership and other comrades, he wrote articles under a pseudonym, speaking from a third-person perspective. In order to avoid others recognizing his handwriting, he even asked his young daughter to copy the manuscript for him. He shielded counter-revolutionaries and privately placed many relatives with unclear political backgrounds in the army and state organs; during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he continuously published articles, saying that "it is not okay to sleep with tigers," and "calling on" everyone to treat their counter-revolutionary relatives with the spirit of sacrificing personal interests for the sake of the country, in order to cover up his own actions. During the rectification campaign, he incited trouble everywhere, colluding with bourgeois rightist elements from the inside and outside, and frantically opposing the Party and socialism, but he also continuously published anti-rightist articles in newspapers and periodicals, portraying himself as a leftist, in order to confuse the public and deceive the masses.

　　During the meeting, he quibbled, denied, and continued to use his double-dealing tactics, and his attitude was very bad. But in the face of ironclad evidence, he finally had to admit that he was a rightist element within the Party who had committed serious crimes against the Party and socialism. (Attached picture)

### 总政治部把陈沂放在照妖镜下  假左派真右派真假大白  他采取了“攻其一点尽量夸大不及其余”的手法诬蔑新社会

　　总政治部把陈沂放在照妖镜下
　　假左派真右派真假大白
　　他采取了“攻其一点尽量夸大不及其余”的手法诬蔑新社会
    新华社28日讯　由中国人民解放军总政治部机关党委召集的批判原总政治部文化部部长、党内右派分子陈沂的会议，从1957年11月13日开始，先后经过二十五次会议，已于今年2月12日结束。大会所揭露出来的大量事实，证明陈沂是一个犯有反党反社会主义严重罪行的党内右派分子，是一个极端卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义野心家，是一个彻头彻尾的两面派和投机分子。彻底揭露陈沂这个假左派真右派的真面目，是总政治部机关反右派斗争战线上所获得的一个重大胜利。
    1957年5月，正当资产阶级右派利用我党整风的机会猖狂向党发起进攻的时候，陈沂抓紧时机脱去他的“左”派伪装，在天津、锦州等处连续发表反党反社会主义的言论，公开与资产阶级右派站在一条战线上向党发起进攻，成为资产阶级右派在我们党内有力的内应。
    否认阶级斗争，主张取消专政，他认为社会主义制度许多地方值得研究，他提出应当学习资产阶级民主。
    陈沂竭力宣传阶级斗争熄灭论，反对无产阶级专政。他说“反革命只有十万分之一了”，而且其中还有地主坏分子受管制的。他说：“今天什么家庭出身都不成问题，因为他们都改造了。”他认为现在已没有人要反对共产党了。因此，他就认为：既然阶级矛盾没有了，阶级斗争就可以取消了，也再用不着专政了。
    他公然攻击我国的社会主义制度。他说我国社会制度还有许多地方值得研究，他还说社会主义也可能像封建王朝那样改朝换代。他诬蔑农业合作化后的新农村，认为由于农业合作化，军人已陷于“告老还乡无乡可还，解甲归田无田可归”的悲惨境地。他还竭力赞扬资产阶级民主，提出要向资产阶级民主学习。
    他认为党和人民隔了一道墙，煽动人们用“暴风雨”的方式推倒这道墙。他借着党的鸣放方针大肆对党攻击。他把一切矛盾都归结成党和人民的矛盾，并认为党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针是被迫提出来的。他说：“人民内部矛盾就是党和人民之间的矛盾”，“我们党和人民现在隔了一道墙”，因此，他就煽动人们起来以“暴风雨”方式推倒这道墙。
    他诬蔑军队完全脱离了人民群众，他胡说教条主义统治了军队中的一切。
    陈沂除连续发表上述反党反社会主义的反动言论外，他还以歪曲、捏造、渲染、夸大的卑劣手段诬蔑和攻击中国人民解放军及其领导机关。他诬蔑军队不敢贯彻党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针。他诬蔑军队已完全脱离了人民群众。他诬蔑军队毫无民主气息。他诬蔑军队中到处是教条主义，教条主义已统治了一切。在陈沂看来，军队是漆黑一团矛盾重重；军队领导机关的官僚主义也已经达到令人不能容忍的地步。
    在整风反右派斗争中，陈沂对攻击党和军队领导的人多方给以鼓励、支持，并为之开脱。他支持与赞扬天津师范学院一个右派分子所写的反党反社会主义的“狂人日记”；他支持该学院一些右派分子准备创办的“同人报”，并要学院拿钱给以支持。
    陈沂这种反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，绝不是偶然发生的，这是他资产阶级个人主义恶性发展的必然结果，也是长时期以来反党反领导活动的继续。
    他把自己领导的文化部当成独立王国，只准他向党向上级要人、要钱，不准党和上级对他的工作进行监督和检查。
    在他任总政文化部长期间，他的极端恶劣的资产阶级个人主义思想作风就表现得相当突出，并不断受到总政领导上的严厉批判。他目无组织、目无领导、唯我独尊。他把他所领导的文化部当成一个独立王国，当做他争名夺利的工具，只准他向党向上级要支持、要人要钱，不准党和上级对他的工作进行监督和批评。他把长时期以来军队文化工作在党的领导和全军文化干部共同努力下所取得的成绩，全部算在自己的账上，并成为炫耀自己和向党斗争的资本。他不经组织批准竟私自委任十多名校级军官。他对总政几次检查文化部的工作，都采取了极为恶劣的抗拒态度。他的理论是：“对上只有‘抗’、‘顶’才能解决问题。”1957年春季，军委决定总政文化部与宣传部合并，他认为这是取消了他借以发展个人权势和名利的独立王国，大为不满。他先是反对，后是拆台，进行了一系列的反党的分裂活动。他用尽方法，到处散布散伙情绪，鼓励文化工作干部离开部队，企图将军队的文艺工作拆垮，以证明军队没有他这个“文艺领导”，在文艺工作上就什么也不行了。
    在军队内部他以“文艺特点”同领导上对抗，在军队外部又以“军队特点”以“实力派”自居，企图与党的整个文艺工作分庭抗礼。
    在文艺工作方面，尽管他在口头上也拥护党的文艺路线，但在实际工作中他却极力脱离党的领导、脱离部队实际，和党的文艺路线相对抗。他十分强调文艺的特殊性，要求一切工作“都应是为了保证艺术工作上的成功”。他片面地强调专业提高，在文艺干部中大量地灌输个人成名成家的思想。他对学术性问题不懂，偏又要充内行，哗众取宠，信口开河。在军队内部他以“文艺特点”同领导上对抗；而在军队外部则又以“军队特点”以“实力派”自居，企图与党的整个文艺工作分庭抗礼。
    他伪善，奸诈，对党对同志都玩弄机巧权术和两面手法，道德品质惊人的堕落。
    陈沂道德品质的堕落，已达到令人不能相信的地步。他伪善、奸诈，对党对同志都玩弄机巧权术，使用两面手法。他惯于拉拉扯扯，吹吹拍拍。谁顺从他，他就视为知己，封官许愿；谁要触犯他的一点个人利益和尊严，他就恨之入骨，想尽办法打击报复，直至政治上的陷害。他不惜在干部中挑拨离间制造矛盾，自己从中讨得好感和信任。他为笼络干部、收买人心，把自己扮成是最关心干部的领导者。他对干部的要求，不论合理与否随便许愿，当领导上审查不批准时，他就把责任推到领导身上，一面在干部中进行恶意的煽动；一面他则装成群众舆论的代表和领导对抗。为抬高自己、打击领导和其他同志，他就用化名写文章，以第三者的口吻来说话，为避免别人识破他的笔迹，竟叫自己的小女孩为他抄稿。他包庇反革命，私自安置了不少政治上不清楚的亲属在部队和国家机关工作；在肃反时他却连续发表文章，说什么“同老虎在一起睡觉是不行的”，并“号召”大家以大义灭亲的精神对待自己反革命的亲属，借以掩饰自己。在整风中他到处煽风点火，与资产阶级右派分子里应外合，疯狂地反党反社会主义，但又连续地在报刊上发表反右派文章，把自己打扮成为一个左派，来混淆视听蒙蔽群众。
    在会议进行过程中，他狡辩、抵赖，还继续使用他的两面派手法，态度是十分恶劣的。但在铁证如山的事实面前，最后他不能不承认他是一个犯了严重反党反社会主义罪行的党内右派分子。（附图片）
