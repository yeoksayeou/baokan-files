Comrades:

Please allow me, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to extend, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, to you and, through you, to the glorious Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the fraternal Mongolian people, our lofty respect and heartfelt congratulations, and wish your Party's 13th National Congress complete and brilliant success.

The Mongolian people are a diligent, brave, and freedom-loving nation. As early as the 1920s, 25 years before the great victory of the Chinese revolution, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, achieved the victory of national liberation and embarked on the broad path of peaceful labor opened up by the October Socialist Revolution. Subsequently, with the sincere and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, overcame the backwardness of feudalism and many other difficulties, and carried out socialist reforms and socialist construction, which transformed the social face of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Mongolian people also made glorious contributions in the struggle against our common enemy – Japanese imperialism.

The Chinese people are very pleased to see that the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic has been successfully completed. Now, Mongolia has increasingly developed modern industry and modern transportation. Mongolia's own working class and ranks of laboring intellectuals are expanding day by day. The socialist transformation of individual herders and small commodity economy has also made great progress in recent years. On the basis of the increasingly rising national economy, the material and cultural life of the Mongolian people has been further improved. Mongolia's national education, healthcare, and cultural and scientific undertakings are also constantly flourishing. There are no illiterates among the adult population of Mongolia. Literature and art with national characteristics are also developing day by day. As you know, as fraternal parties and peoples, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people have always closely cared about everything of your party and your people, and regard your achievements as our own.

Undoubtedly, all these achievements of the Mongolian people have been achieved under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, is one of the vanguard forces of the working class with a fighting tradition in our international communist family. The convening of the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party comes at a time when the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Party, are united, full of confidence, and striving to realize the Three-Year Plan. We are confident that this Congress will bring new inspiration and a surge of creative labor in building socialism to the Mongolian people, and will generate a new great leap forward in the development of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, and will thereby make new contributions to enhancing the strength of the socialist camp and striving for the cause of Far East and world peace.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have also made a series of significant achievements in their great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past eight years. We basically completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in 1956, and then achieved victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in 1957. At the same time, we have successfully completed the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Now, a high tide of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is sweeping across China. The basic task of our people is to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology within fifteen years. In order to achieve this basic task, our people have put forward a slogan, which is to catch up with and surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years. At the same time, our common and sincere friend – the great Soviet people – will catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country – the United States – in industrial production. By that time, we will leave the imperialist world far behind in the peaceful competition.

We Chinese people, like the Mongolian people, firmly stand on the side of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The people of our two countries know from their own experience that the friendship, cooperation, and close unity between us and the people of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are one of the basic guarantees for the independence and prosperity of our countries and the happiness and prosperity of our people. This also explains why we should cherish the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as we cherish our own eyes. Now, the East Wind has clearly prevailed over the West Wind internationally. Due to the great achievements of the Moscow Conference of Communist Parties last year and the great success of the Soviet Union in launching artificial satellites, the superiority of socialism over imperialism, which already existed, has undergone a new change, thereby enabling the development of the international situation to reach a new turning point that is more favorable to our socialist camp, more favorable to the socialist construction of our countries, and more favorable to the cause of world people's struggle for peace and human progress. The light of peace and socialism is now shining all over the world with overwhelming dominance.

The friendship and unity between the people of our two countries, China and Mongolia, are an integral part of the friendship and unity between the people of all countries in our entire socialist camp. The people of our two countries, China and Mongolia, are fraternal nations and have been close neighbors since ancient times. Now, the friendship between the people of our two countries has developed and consolidated further on the basis of socialism with the revolutionary changes in the history of our two peoples, and has become eternal, inseparable, and unbreakable. In addition, a part of the Mongolian people also live in China, living and fighting together with the Han people, and have established their own autonomous regions, becoming equal members of the united and loving family of all nationalities in our country. Politics, economy, and culture are constantly developing, and life is constantly improving. This fact also adds glory to the great friendship between the people of our two countries, making the people of our two countries feel closer and more intimate with each other. We firmly believe that with the increasing prosperity and flourishing of the socialist cause of our two countries, the fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation in political, economic, cultural, and other fields between the people of our two countries will be further expanded and consolidated.

Dear comrades, the 13th National Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party marks a new starting point for your party and your people in striving for new victories in the struggle to build socialism. Let me once again express my heartfelt congratulations to your party and your people.

Now, please allow me to read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the 13th National Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.

    乌兰夫在蒙古人民革命党代表大会上说
    大会标志着蒙古人民争取新胜利的起点
    中蒙友谊在社会主义的基础上更加发展和巩固亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我执行中国共产党中央委员会的委托，代表中国共产党和中国人民，向你们并通过你们向光荣的蒙古人民革命党和兄弟的蒙古人民，致以崇高的敬意和衷心的祝贺，祝你们党的第十三次全国代表大会获得圆满的光辉的成就。
    蒙古人民是勤劳、勇敢和热爱自由的民族。早在二十年代，在中国革命取得伟大胜利的二十五年以前，蒙古人民就在蒙古人民革命党的领导之下，取得了民族解放的胜利，走上了十月社会主义革命所开辟的和平劳动的康庄大道。随后，在伟大的苏联的真诚无私的援助下，蒙古人民又在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，克服了封建主义的落后性和其他很多困难，进行了社会主义改革和社会主义建设，使蒙古人民共和国的社会面貌为之焕然一新。蒙古人民还在反对我们的共同的敌人——日本帝国主义的斗争中，作出了光荣的贡献。
    中国人民非常高兴地看到，蒙古人民共和国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划已经胜利地完成。现在，蒙古已经拥有日益发展的现代化工业和现代化交通运输业。蒙古自己的工人阶级和劳动知识分子的队伍正在日益扩大。对个体牧民和小商品经济的社会主义改造也在最近几年获得了巨大的进展。在国民经济日益高涨的基础上，蒙古人民的物质和文化生活已经有了进一步的改善。蒙古的国民教育、保健事业和文化科学事业也在不断地繁荣滋长。在蒙古的全国成年人口中已经没有文盲。具有民族特点的文学艺术也在日益发展。正如你们所知道的，作为兄弟的党和人民，中国共产党和中国人民一向密切地关怀着你们的党和你们的人民的一切，把你们的成就看成是我们自己的成就一样。
    无疑地，蒙古人民的这一切成就都是在蒙古人民革命党的领导之下取得的。用马克思列宁主义武装起来的蒙古人民革命党是我们国际共产主义大家庭中具有战斗传统的工人阶级先锋队之一。蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会的召开，正当蒙古人民在党的领导下团结一致、满怀信心、努力为实现三年计划而奋斗的时候。我们确信，这次大会必将给蒙古人民带来新的鼓舞力量，带来建设社会主义的创造性劳动的热潮，而使蒙古人民共和国的国民经济的发展产生一个新的巨大的跃进，并从而对增强社会主义阵营的力量、争取远东和世界和平的事业作出新的贡献。
    我们中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，八年来也在自己的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业上取得了一系列重大的成就。我们在1956年基本上实现了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造，接着在1957年又取得了政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利。与此同时，我们又顺利地完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。现在，在全中国到处都掀起了又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义的高潮。我国人民的基本任务，是要在十五年内把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学技术的社会主义强国。为了实现这个基本任务，我国人民提出了一个口号，这就是要在十五年后在钢铁和其他主要工业产品方面赶上和超过英国。在这同时，我们共同的真挚的朋友——伟大的苏联人民将在工业生产上赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家——美国。到那个时候，我们就要在和平竞赛中把帝国主义世界远远地抛在我们的后面了。
    我们中国人民，同蒙古人民一样，坚决地站在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营一边。我们两国人民都从自己的亲身体验中知道，我们同苏联和其他社会主义各国人民之间的友谊合作和亲密团结是我们国家的独立强盛和人民生活的幸福繁荣的基本保证之一。这也就说明，我们为什么要像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。现在，在国际上东风已经明显地压倒西风了。由于去年各国共产党莫斯科会议的伟大成就和苏联在发射人造卫星上的伟大成功，原来就存在着的社会主义对于帝国主义的优势就发生了一个新的变化，从而使国际形势的发展达到了更有利于我们社会主义阵营、更有利于我们各国的社会主义建设、更有利于世界人民争取和平和人类进步事业的一个新的转折点。和平和社会主义事业的光芒现在正以压倒的优势在照耀着全世界。
    我们中蒙两国人民之间的友谊和团结，是我们整个社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友谊和团结的不可分割的组成部分。我们中蒙两国人民是兄弟民族，从古以来就是亲邻。现在我们两国人民的友谊随着我们两国人民历史上的革命变化在社会主义的基础上更加发展和巩固起来，已经成为永恒的、不可分离的、牢不可破的了。除此以外，在中国境内还居住着一部分蒙古族人民，他们同汉族人民生活和斗争在一起，并且已经建立了自己的自治区，成为我国各民族团结友爱大家庭中平等的一员。政治、经济、文化在不断的发展，生活也在不断的改善着。这个事实也在我们两国人民的伟大友谊中增添了光辉，使我们两国人民彼此之间感到更加亲近和亲密。我们坚决相信，随着我们两国社会主义事业的日益兴旺和繁荣，我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊以及政治、经济、文化各方面的互助合作必将更加扩大和巩固。
    亲爱的同志们，蒙古人民革命党第十三次全国代表大会标志着你们的党和你们的人民在建设社会主义的斗争中争取新的胜利的一个新的起点，让我再一次向你们的党和你们的人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    现在，请允许我宣读中国共产党中央委员会给蒙古人民革命党第十三次全国代表大会的贺电。
