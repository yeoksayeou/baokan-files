Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 10th: Soviet scientists at the Chemical Technology Laboratory and the New Fiber Textile Laboratory of the Central Cotton Textile Industry Scientific Research Institute have invented a new technology for manufacturing "textiles" for various purposes with beautiful appearances without weaving. The manufacturing process of this "textile" is similar to papermaking, the price is cheap, and the production time is 90% shorter than using ordinary weaving methods. This was stated by Soviet female scientist Smirnyagina in a recent article in "Youth Technology" magazine.

In her article entitled "Non-Woven Textiles," the author introduced this new method, saying: We know that cotton bolls have short fibers resembling fluff that are only five to seven millimeters long. These short fibers are usually not suitable for spinning into cotton yarn, but Soviet chemists have successfully used bonding methods to turn these waste scraps from the textile process into "textiles." The method is as follows: Put the short cotton fibers discarded from the carding machine into a glue pool, and after one or two minutes, take out the cotton fibers soaked in glue and rinse them with salt water. Within a few minutes, they will bond into a strong "textile." This "textile" can be washed, ironed, will not crack, and will not lose its firmness.

They can use various glues and mixed fibers to make various different "textiles." Some are as soft and fluffy as flannel; some are as dense as paper; some look like sanitary cotton wool but are warmer than woolen fabrics.

    织布如造纸　价廉生产易
    苏联发明不用纺织的纺织品
    据新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联中央棉织品工业科学研究所的化学工艺实验室和新纤维纺织实验室的科学工作者，发明了一种不用纺织便能制造各种用途不同、外表美观的“纺织品”的新技术。这种“纺织品”的制造过程和造纸相似，价格便宜，生产时间比用普通的织造方法要短90％。这是苏联女科学家斯米尔尼亚金娜最近在“青年技术”杂志上的一篇文章中所说的。
    作者在这篇题为“不用纺织的纺织品”的文章中介绍这种新方法时说：我们知道，棉铃中有一种长仅五至七毫米的绒毛似的短纤维。这种短纤维通常是不能用来纺成棉纱的，但苏联化学家却成功地用粘结方法把这些纺织过程中的废屑制成“纺织物”。方法是这样：把梳毛机上淘汰下来的短棉纤维放进胶水池中，一、二分钟后，将浸透了胶水的棉纤维取出用盐水冲洗，几分钟之内便胶结成一种牢固的“纺织物”了。这种“纺织物”可以洗，可以熨，不会裂开，也不会失掉它的牢固性。
    他们运用各种胶水和各种混合纤维能制成各种不同的“纺织品”。有的像法兰绒一样柔软多绒；有的像纸一样密实，有的看上去像卫生绒，但是比毛织物还暖和。
