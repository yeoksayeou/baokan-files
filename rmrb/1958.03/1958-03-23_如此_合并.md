    Notes

    Such a "Merger"
    According to a report by the Associated Press, former British Prime Minister Churchill recently completed a new book entitled "The Great Democracies." In this book, Churchill calls for English-speaking nations to establish an increasingly close alliance, and to "finally implement a merger."
    What kind of "merger" Churchill is asking for is not explained in the book. However, considering that the most powerful of the English-speaking nations in the world today is not Britain, but the United States, this "merger" would certainly only involve other English-speaking nations, including Britain, being "merged" into the United States.
    So, why would Churchill resort to such a poor strategy? This can be explained by the current British Conservative government's policy of trying to rely on the United States to maintain Britain's crumbling colonial rule. In other words, in order to maintain British colonial interests, the likes of Churchill do not hesitate to have Britain "merge" into the United States.
    However, it can also be asserted that the result of this "merger" will not only fail to maintain British colonial interests, but will instead turn Britain into a colony of the United States. Churchill's wishful thinking for British colonial interests can only be in vain.

### 如此“合并”

    如此“合并”
    据合众社报道，英国前首相丘吉尔最近完成了一部题为“伟大的民主国家”的新书。在这部书里，丘吉尔要求英语民族建立一个愈来愈紧密的联盟，并且要“最后实行合并”。
    丘吉尔要求的究竟是怎样的一种“合并”，这在书中没有加以说明。但是，在当今世界上的英语民族的国家中，最强大的不是英国，而是美国这个事实看来，这种“合并”肯定的只会是包括英国在内的其他英语民族国家“合并”于美国。
    那么，丘吉尔为什么要出此下策呢？这可以从目前英国保守党政府所执行的力图依靠美国来维持英国摇摇欲坠的殖民统治的政策中找到解释。换句话说，为了保持英国的殖民利益，丘吉尔之流是不惜使英国“合并”于美国的。
    但是，也可以肯定的是：这种“合并”的结果，不但不能保持英国的殖民利益，相反的还会使英国成为美国的殖民地。丘吉尔为英国的殖民利益所作的如意打算，只能是枉费心机。
