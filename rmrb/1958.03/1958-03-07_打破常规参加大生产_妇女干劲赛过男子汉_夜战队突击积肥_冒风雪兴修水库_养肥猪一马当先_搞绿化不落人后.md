Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: During the nationwide rectification movement, the mental outlook of rural women across the country has undergone tremendous changes.

During the production upsurge from last winter to this spring, rural women in various regions have changed their old habits of "not going to the fields in winter, staying home to sew clothes." According to statistics from eleven provinces and cities, including Hubei, Hunan, Shanxi, and Hebei, the number of women participating in production from last winter to this spring accounted for about 90% of the total female labor force, with some cooperatives reaching 100%. Women in the mountainous areas of Fujian have historically not had the habit of labor. Since December of last year, according to statistics from twenty-one counties including Nanping, Jianyang, Jiangle, and Guangze, the attendance rate of women participating in production has increased from 40% in the past to 60% to 80%.

The heroic spirit of many rural women in the Great Leap Forward in production is no less than that of male commune members. When the Xiejin Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, was building water conservancy projects, many male commune members initially felt that the target of six cubic meters of earthwork per person per day proposed by the cooperative was too high. However, the women in the cooperative organized a shock team, averaging seven cubic meters of earthwork per person, with the highest averaging ten cubic meters per person per day. They dispelled the concerns of the male commune members and promoted the cooperative's water conservancy construction. In the production activities from last winter to this spring, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives' fertilizer accumulation tasks were completed by women. In Dali County, Shaanxi Province, 80% of the winter fertilizer accumulation tasks were undertaken by women. Women in Lijiang Township, Xingan County, Jiangxi Province, organized fourteen night teams to rush to accumulate fertilizer every night. They have now accumulated more than 2.4 million dan of fertilizer, exceeding four times the total amount of fertilizer accumulated by the entire township in the same period last year. Many young and strong women also worked with male commune members to successfully complete tasks such as digging wells, repairing canals, excavating waterlogged ponds, building reservoirs, and building terraces. Thirty-three women from the Youai Cooperative in Nancheng County, Jiangxi Province, braved wind and snow to open mountains and chisel rocks, building a "Women's Reservoir" in just over a month. Women have made even greater contributions to afforestation, field management, eliminating the four pests, and raising pigs. Of the 8.46 million pigs raised in Shandong Province, more than 80% are mainly raised by women. More than 1,500 women in the four districts of Dingbian County, Shaanxi Province, afforested more than 2,000 mu.

    养肥猪一马当先  搞绿化不落人后
    据新华社5日讯　全国农村妇女在全民整风运动中，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    在去冬今春的生产高潮中，各地农村妇女改变了过去“冬季不上地，在家把衣缝”的旧习惯。据湖北、湖南、山西、河北等十一个省市统计，去冬今春妇女参加生产的人数占妇女劳动力总数的90％左右，有的社达到百分之百。福建山区妇女历来没有劳动习惯，从去年12月份以来，据南平、建阳、将乐和光泽等二十一个县的统计，妇女参加生产的出勤率由过去的40％提高到60％到80％。
    许多农村妇女在生产大跃进中的豪迈气概不下男社员。江苏省江都县协进农业社在兴修水利时，许多男社员最初认为社里提出的每人一天打六方土的指标太高，但社里的妇女组织了突击组，每人平均打七方土，最高的每人一天平均打十方土。她们打破了男社员的顾虑，推动了全社的水利建设。在去冬今春的生产活动中，绝大多数农业社的积肥任务是由妇女完成的。陕西省大荔县80％的冬季积肥任务是由妇女担任的。江西省新干县溧江乡妇女组织了十四个积肥夜战队，每天晚上突击积肥，现在她们已经积肥二百四十多万担，超过去年同期全乡积肥量的四倍。许多年青力壮的妇女还和男社员一起出色地完成打井、修渠、挖涝池、修水池和修梯田等任务。江西省南城县友爱社三十三名妇女冒着风雪开山凿石，在一个多月时间内建成了一座“妇女水库”。在植树造林、田间管理、除四害、养猪等活动中，妇女的贡献更大。山东全省所养的八百四十六万头猪有80％以上是以妇女为主饲养的。陕西省定边县四个区的一千五百多名妇女就造林两千多亩。
