Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 22nd: According to the Korean Central News Agency, at today's meeting of the secretaries-general of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side protested to the U.S. side about the continued violation of the armistice agreement by U.S. military aircraft invading the airspace over the Korean-Chinese side, and demanded that the U.S. side thoroughly investigate these incidents, provide a comprehensive explanation, and severely punish those involved.

At the meeting, the U.S. secretary-general accepted the written materials submitted by the Korean-Chinese side regarding the violation of the armistice agreement by U.S. military aircraft invading the airspace over the Korean-Chinese region, and stated that an explanation would be provided after a "thorough investigation."

The secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that from February 4th to March 19th, there were a total of twenty-two such violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side, with a total of forty-two sorties of U.S. military aircraft intruding into the airspace over the Korean-Chinese side. This means that during this period, U.S. military aircraft invaded the airspace over the Korean-Chinese region an average of once every two days and an average of one aircraft per day. On February 20th alone, U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over many regions of the Korean-Chinese side in nine consecutive incidents, totaling twenty-four sorties.

The secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side emphasized that at the Military Armistice Commission meeting held on March 10th, the Korean-Chinese side lodged a strong protest to the U.S. side against the serious violation of the armistice agreement by U.S. military aircraft conducting hostile activities by invading the airspace over the Korean-Chinese region three times in a row on March 6th. It also demanded that the U.S. side guarantee that such incidents would not occur again, and the U.S. chief commissioner also admitted the aforementioned violations of the armistice agreement at the meeting. However, in the ten days from that meeting until March 19th, there were six more such violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side.

    美军用机侵犯朝中地区上空
    朝中方面提出严重抗议
    新华社平壤22日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在今天举行的朝鲜军事停战委员会秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长就美方军用飞机继续违反停战协定侵犯朝中方面地区上空的事件向美方提出抗议，并且要求美方对这些事件进行彻查，作出全面交代和严惩有关人员。
    美方秘书长在会议上接受了朝中方面提出的有关美方军用飞机违反停战协定侵犯朝中地区上空的书面资料，并且表示将在“彻底调查”以后作出交代。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，从2月4日到3月19日，美方这种违反停战协定的事件共发生了二十二起，侵入朝中方面地区上空的美军飞机共四十二架次。这就是说，在这段期间内，美军飞机平均每两天一次和平均每天一架侵入朝中地区上空。仅在2月20日一天，美方军用飞机连续九起、共二十四架次侵入朝中方面的许多地区上空。
    朝中方面秘书长着重指出，在3月10日举行的军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面对美方军用飞机在3月6日连续三次侵犯朝中地区上空进行敌对活动的严重违反停战协定的行为，向美方提出了强硬抗议，并且要求美方保证不再发生这类事件，美方首席委员也在会议上承认了上述违反停战协定的事实。但是，就在那一次会议以后到3月19日为止的十天内，美方这种违反停战协定的事件就又发生了六起。
