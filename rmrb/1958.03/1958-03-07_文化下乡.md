Brotherly Countries' Cultural Life

    Culture Goes to the Countryside
    In the era of the people's government, socialist culture in Bulgaria's countryside is splendid and fruitful. Today, there is no village without cultural institutions; among the working farmers, there are no more illiterates under the age of fifty; the number of agricultural laborers receiving secondary education is increasing day by day. People are living an increasingly prosperous and cultured life. Schools, cultural clubs, radio networks, health facilities, running water, etc., have now entered the lives of Bulgarian farmers.
    By the end of last year, there were 3,359 electrified villages, and the number of radio loudspeakers reached more than 200,000 in 1956, although there were only more than 1,400 electrified villages at that time. Movies have long become the most common form of entertainment for farmers.
    In addition, cultural clubs are important and historically long-standing institutions in the Bulgarian countryside. They serve as cultural centers. Before liberation, they educated farmers to oppose reactionary dark forces, but true prosperity came in the era of the people's government. Now every cultural club has a library, and books have become close friends of every household. (Attached pictures)

    文化下乡
    在人民政权年代里，保加利亚农村的社会主义文化，花色灿烂果实丰硕。如今，没有一个农村没有文化机构；在劳动农民中间，已找不到五十岁以下的文盲了；受到中等教育的农业劳动者一天天增多起来。人们过着日益富裕的有文化的生活。学校、文化俱乐部、广播网、保健机构、自来水等等，现在都已进入了保加利亚农民的生活之中。
    到去年年底，电气化的村庄已有三千三百五十九个，广播收听喇叭在1956年就已达到了二十多万个，虽然那时电气化的村庄才有一千四百多个。电影也早已成为农民最普遍的娱乐了。
    此外，文化俱乐部是在保加利亚农村中重要而且具有悠久历史的机构，它们起着文化中心的作用，解放前，曾教育农民反对反动的黑暗势力，但是真正的繁荣还是在人民政权年代，现在每一个文化俱乐部都附设有图书馆，书籍已是家家户户的密友了。（附图片）
