    A New Type of Cement
    The Cement Industry Research Institute of the former Ministry of Building Materials Industry has successfully developed a new type of cement—red mud sulfate cement. It is made of 45%-50% red mud (waste product of the aluminum industry), 30%-35% blast furnace slag, 14%-16% gypsum, and 2%-3% lime.
    The manufacturing process of this cement is relatively simple and does not require the sintering of clinker in a rotary kiln. The manufacturing cost is also low; its technical and economic indicators are much lower than those of ordinary Portland cement. The coal consumption per ton of cement can be reduced by 87.3% calculated using standard coal, the electricity consumption can be reduced by 82.5%, and the basic construction investment can be reduced by 46%.
    This cement has special properties such as water resistance, impermeability, and corrosion resistance, making it very suitable for use in hydraulic concrete and large-volume concrete.

    一种新水泥
    前建筑材料工业部水泥工业研究院试验成功一种新的水泥——赤泥硫酸盐水泥。它是由45％—50％赤泥（制铝工业的废品），30％—35％高炉矿渣，14％—16％石膏和2％—3％的石灰制成。
    这种水泥的制造过程较简单，不需经过回转窑烧制熟料程序。制造成本也低，它的技术经济指标比普通矽酸盐水泥要低得多，每吨水泥的耗煤量按标准煤计算可以节省87.3％，耗电量可以节省82.5％，基本建设投资可以节省46％。
    这种水泥具有抗水、抗渗、抗蚀等特殊性能，很适用于水工混凝土和大体积混凝土使用。
