    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 24th: Over six hundred and forty representatives from three different factions of Japanese farmers' groups held a conference in Tokyo today, establishing a unified organization of farmers' groups – the All-Japan Farmers' Association Federation, thereby ending the state of division that has plagued the Japanese farmers' movement for the eleven years since the war.

    Previously, the main Japanese farmers' organizations were divided into the National Federation of Japanese Farmers' Associations, the National Farmers' Association, and the New Rural Construction faction of the National Farmers' Association. Today, they all participated in the newly established federation.

    The newly established All-Japan Farmers' Association Federation will have 250,000 farmer members.

    After the conference approved the federation's action plan for this year, it then adopted the conference declaration.

    The conference declaration called on the farmers participating in the federation and all other farmers across the country to join hands and move forward in order to eliminate the exploitation of farmers by monopoly capital, safeguard the interests of farmers, make the All-Japan Farmers' Association Federation a powerful organization with the participation of over six million farm households nationwide, and realize the great cause of liberating farmers at an early date.

    据新华社24日讯　东京消息：三个不同派系的日本农民团体的六百四十多名代表，今天在东京举行大会，成立了农民团体的统一组织——全日本农民协会联合会，从此结束了日本农民运动战后十一年来处于分裂的状态。
