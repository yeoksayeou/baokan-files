    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Damascus "Today" newspaper reported that an American plane carrying a large quantity of handcuffs arrived in the Jordanian capital Amman on the 3rd. These handcuffs are intended to be used against Jordanian patriots who were arrested for participating in anti-government demonstrations not long ago. Several heavy trucks transported the handcuffs from the airport to the Amman police station.
    According to a report from the Beirut "Al-Sharq" newspaper, the Jordanian authorities dispatched Bedouin troops to suppress the people's movement against joining the Baghdad Pact and forming a federation with Iraq.
    The Bedouins surrounded the cities of Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Hebron, Ramallah, and the Arab part of Jerusalem. Hundreds of people have been arrested in western Jordan alone. All large and medium-sized schools in the country have been closed, many students have been arrested, and 370 students have been expelled from school. The newspaper wrote that the Jordanian authorities had issued an order that anyone who expresses welcome to the United Arab Republic or President Nasser should be detained.

    美国供给约旦大批手铐
    约旦大肆迫害爱国者
    据新华社讯　大马士革“今天报”报道，一架美国飞机载着大批手铐在3日飞抵约旦首都安曼，这批手铐是用来对付不久前参加反政府示威游行而遭到逮捕的约旦爱国者的。有数辆载重汽车把这批手铐从机场运到安曼警察局。
    据贝鲁特“东方报”报道，约旦当局派遣了贝都印人部队，去镇压反对参加巴格达条约以及同伊拉克结成联邦的人民运动。
    贝都印人包围了纳布鲁斯、图尔卡姆、卡尔基利、哈利尔、拉马拉等城市以及耶路撒冷的阿拉伯部分。仅在约旦西部被逮捕的人就达到数百人。国内的大、中学校都被封闭，很多学生被捕，有三百七十名学生被学校开除。报纸写道，约旦当局曾经下令，凡是表示欢迎阿拉伯联合共和国或者纳赛尔总统的人都要加以拘禁。
