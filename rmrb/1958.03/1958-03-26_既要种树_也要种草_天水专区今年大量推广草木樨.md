　　Both Planting Trees and Growing Grass
　　Tianshui Prefecture Vigorously Promotes Sweet Clover This Year
　　(Our Newspaper) News: This year, Tianshui Prefecture, Gansu Province, will promote sweet clover on more than 1.1 million mu. According to the relevant responsible comrades of Tianshui Prefecture, this is a major measure for Tianshui Prefecture to change its arid appearance and promote agricultural science and technology. Through this measure, some barren hills in Tianshui Prefecture will be covered more quickly, many arid and barren lands will double their grain production, and many mountainous areas lacking fuel, fodder, and fertilizer will become abundant in firewood, forage, and fertilizer. In addition, through this measure, it can also open up avenues for sideline production in mountainous areas and accelerate the change of the impoverished face of mountainous areas. Last year, Tianshui Prefecture had imparted sweet clover planting technology to more than 30,000 people, which laid the foundation for large-scale sweet clover planting this year.
　　From 1943, when Yang Shirong, a farmer in Tianshui County, tried planting sweet clover, to the end of 1957, the entire prefecture had systematically promoted sweet clover on 770,000 mu. From 1953 to 1955, the entire prefecture also supplied about 1.52 million jin of sweet clover seeds to provinces and other areas.
　　The experience of the masses in Tianshui area in planting shows that the root nodule bacteria and the annual fallen leaves can provide the soil with great fertilizer efficiency. Using it in rotation with other crops can increase production by 70% to more than three times in the first year. Many areas have promoted sweet clover, and quickly solved the long-standing difficulties of the masses lacking fuel, fodder, and fertilizer, and have played a significant role in improving soil and conserving water and soil. Recently, it has been discovered that sweet clover seeds can be used for winemaking, vinegar making, and flour making; sweet clover flowers are a good source of honey; and sweet clover stalks can be peeled to extract fiber for making ropes. According to experiments in other areas, it can also fix sand and prevent wind, and can also prevent waterlogging in southern China. Sweet clover seeds can also be pressed for oil. This proves that planting sweet clover can not only increase agricultural production, but also is an important industrial raw material.

### 既要种树　也要种草  天水专区今年大量推广草木樨

    既要种树　也要种草
    天水专区今年大量推广草木樨
    本报讯　甘肃省天水专区今年将推广草木樨一百一十多万亩。据天水专区有关负责同志谈，这是天水专区改变干旱面貌、推广农业科学技术中的一项重大措施。通过这项措施天水专区的一些荒山会更快的覆盖起来，不少干旱贫瘠的土地会加倍地增产粮食，不少三料俱缺的山区会变得柴草、饲料、肥料丰盛。此外通过这项措施，还能为山区开辟副业生产门路，加速改变山区贫困面貌。去年，天水专区已给三万多人传授了种植草木樨技术，这给今年大规模的种植草木樨打下了基础。
    从1943年天水县农民杨世荣试种草木樨起，到1957年止，全专区已有计划的推广了草木樨七十七万亩。从1953年开始到1955年，全专区还给省内外供应了约一百五十二万多斤草木樨种籽。
    天水地区群众种植的经验证明，它的根部的根瘤菌和每年的落叶，可给土壤以很大的肥效，用它与其它作物轮种，第一年可增产70％到三倍多。许多地区推广了草木樨，很快的把历来群众缺乏燃料、饲料、肥料的困难从根本上解决了，而且对改良土壤、保持水土起了重大作用。最近发现，草木樨种籽可用来酿酒、制醋、制粉；草木樨的花是很好的蜜源；草木樨秆可剥出纤维打绳。据其他地区的试验，还能固沙防风，在我国南方还能防涝。草木樨籽还可榨油。由此证明，种植草木樨不但可使农业增产，而且是重要的工业原料。
