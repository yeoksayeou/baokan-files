    Starting from "Sleepless Nights"
    Jing Yu
    In a certain factory, a worker, in order to rush through an urgent task, worked through the night for two consecutive days. On the morning of the third day, he was listless and drowsy, and some people blamed him for not looking like he was working hard.
    This matter sparked discussion among the surrounding people. Some people thought that "sleepless nights" leading to "drowsiness" was understandable and should not be criticized. Some people thought that since we are in the Great Leap Forward, we should maintain a straight upward trajectory and work hard to the end; others thought that there was an irreconcilable contradiction between hard work and rest, that hard work requires sacrificing sleep, and sleep would affect hard work. Opinions varied and no one could agree.
    Some people say that diligence can make one forget food, and excitement can make one forget worries. Can't concentration make one forget sleep? Indeed, when we are enthusiastic and absorbed in something, we can forget about sleep for a short period of time, or a few minutes of sleep can be enough to restore energy. However, if we are constantly in a state of emergency and frequently adopt a "broken" sleep pattern, then the body will not get rest and health will be affected.
    The consumption of a person's energy in a day has a limit. Some people can stay awake for days and nights, but after a few days and nights, the need for sleep will become stronger every hour. Lenin said that those who do not know how to rest also do not know how to work. Therefore, rest and sleep are not the goal; the purpose of rest and sleep is to work better.
    Work and sleep, hard work and rest are a unity of opposites. To work hard, one must be full of energy, vigorous, and full of drive. To achieve this, one must have adequate rest. Rest is not the goal; the purpose of rest is to work harder. In war, experienced commanders always know how to use the gaps between battles and campaigns to rest and reorganize, in order to re-enter another battle or another campaign and achieve greater victories. War and rest seem contradictory, but in essence, they are contradictory and unified; it is a unity of opposites. If we only see one aspect of the contradiction in isolation and cannot see the unity of the contradiction dialectically and comprehensively, or if we emphasize war and ignore rest, then we will violate the laws of development of things and make mistakes of one kind or another.
    Therefore, I fully agree with the first opinion. In order to achieve the Great Leap Forward in production, it is absolutely necessary to stand in front of the masses and lead them to work hard and make breakthroughs, taking advantage of the high enthusiasm of the masses. Otherwise, one cannot act as a promoter. However, a real leap forward cannot rely solely on the enthusiasm and breakthroughs of the masses. It also needs to seek ways to leap forward from improving technology and methods. At the same time, we must cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, prevent excessive fatigue, and provide necessary rest or reorganization, so that everyone can run faster and fly further.

    从“彻夜不眠”说起
    静宇
    有个工厂，一个工人为了突击一项紧急任务，接连两天挑灯夜战，彻夜不眠。第三天早晨，精神萎靡、昏昏欲睡，有人就责怪他不像个苦干的样子。
    这件事，引起了周围人们的议论。有人认为“彻夜不眠”，以致“昏昏欲睡”，是可以谅解的，而不应当受到批评。有人认为既然跃进，就应该保持直线上升，苦干到底；也有人认为苦干和休息之间有着不可调和的矛盾，要苦干就得牺牲睡眠，要睡眠就得影响苦干，议论纷纷，莫衷一是。
    有人说，发愤可以忘食，兴奋可以忘忧。难道专心致志就不可以忘掉睡眠吗？的确，当我们热情洋溢、沉迷于什么东西的时候，在短暂的时间里，可以把睡眠忘掉，或者用几分钟的睡眠就足够使人恢复精神。但是，如果经常处于突击状态，经常采用“折断式”的睡眠方式，那末，身体就得不到休息，健康就会受到影响。
    一天当中，人的精力的消耗总是有个限度的。有些人可以几天几夜不睡，可是，几昼夜过去以后，睡眠的需要就会一个钟头比一个钟头强烈。列宁说过，不会休息也就不会工作。所以，休息和睡眠不是目的，休息和睡眠的目的是为了更好的工作。
    工作和睡眠，苦干和休息都是矛盾的统一，要苦干，就得精神饱满，精力充沛，干劲十足，要做到这一点，就得有适当的休息，休息不是目的，休息的目的是为了更好地苦干。战争中，凡是有经验的统帅，总是善于利用战斗的和战役的空隙，进行休整，以便重新投入另一个战斗和另一个战役，取得更大的胜利。战争和休整好像是矛盾的，从实质上看，它是矛盾的，又是统一的，它是对立的统一。如果我们孤立地只看到矛盾的一方面，不能辩证地全面地看到矛盾的统一，或者一味强调战争，忽视休整，那就违犯事物的发展规律，就要犯这样那样的错误。
    因此，我十分同意第一种意见。为了生产大跃进，乘着群众热情高涨的形势，站在群众的前面带领群众进行苦干和突击，是完全必要的，否则，就不能充当促进派。但是，真正的跃进，却不能仅仅依靠群众的热情和突击，还需要从改进技术改进方法方面寻求跃进的道路。同时，要爱护群众的热情，防止过分的疲劳，给予必要的休息或休整，让大家跑得更快，飞得更远。
