Xinhua News Agency, March 7th, Tokyo Dispatch: According to TASS, Nozaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said on the 5th that the Japanese Communist Party is preparing to submit a resolution to the current session of the Japanese Parliament together with the Socialist Party on declaring Japan a nuclear-free zone.

    Speaking at a mass rally of workers in Nagano City, Nozaka Sanzo criticized the plans of the United States and the Japanese government to store atomic weapons on Japanese territory. He said that the Japanese Communist Party has obtained the support of the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Japanese trade unions, and various democratic organizations, and is prepared to submit the above-mentioned resolution to the parliament together with the Socialist Party. Nozaka Sanzo said that if the Liberal Democratic Party government opposes this resolution, it will be condemned by the people.

    Nozaka Sanzo emphasized that this resolution is of extremely great significance, and passing it will prevent the United States from transporting nuclear weapons to Japan.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 6th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Tokyo Metropolitan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs decided at a recent meeting of representatives to launch a signature campaign from March 15th to 25th, demanding that the United States immediately stop its plan to test hydrogen bombs on Eniwetok Atoll.

    The council also demanded an immediate halt to turning Okinawa and Niijima into atomic and missile bases, and demanded the convening of a summit conference between East and West, and the immediate and unconditional conclusion of an agreement banning nuclear weapons testing.
