    College Students Make Friends with Farmers
    Chang Li
    In the beautiful campus of Peking University, it is common to see students from the Department of Philosophy walking and talking with members of the Lianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, as close as brothers.
    As early as three years ago, the students of the Department of Philosophy organized literacy teams to help the cooperative with literacy and reading newspapers, while also participating in some physical labor. For more than three years, the students, regardless of the cold, wind, and rain, have insisted on going to the cooperative to teach farmers to read and learn culture. Many cooperative members said with emotion: "These college students are not afraid of the cold and come from afar to teach us. How can we not study hard?" Now, some cooperative members who couldn't even read the newspaper in the past can write for the Hai Dian District small newspaper.
    Last year, the teachers and students of the Department of Philosophy organized thirteen voluntary labor teams and established direct contact with the thirteen groups of the agricultural cooperative, regularly participating in their labor. During the winter vacation this year, another group of students went to the agricultural cooperative to eat, live, and work with the members for a week. Liu Shiquan, Du Zhenyuan and other students, when talking about their gains after participating in the labor, said: Besides learning the qualities of diligence, simplicity, and thrift from the farmers, we also learned some common sense of production technology and increased our practical knowledge. The cooperative members also excitedly said: The teachers and students of the Department of Philosophy of Peking University helped us turn more than 30 mu of wasteland and more than 60 mu of dry land into paddy fields; they also taught us to learn culture, sing, and put on plays; they also gave us a double-wheeled double-shared plow and a 7.5 horsepower electric motor... Some old cooperative members also said with emotion: In the past, the students of Yenching University covered their noses when they saw us, thinking we smelled bad. Today, Peking University students come to turn manure and dig mud with us. The college students taught by Chairman Mao are good!
    The work-study program has been launched, and the school has decided to establish a fixed relationship between the Department of Philosophy and the Lianfeng Agricultural Cooperative. (Attached picture)

    大学生和农民做朋友
    常立
    在北京大学优美的校园里，经常可以看到哲学系的一些学生和京郊联丰农业社的社员挽着手在散步、谈笑，他们亲热得像亲兄弟一样。
    早在三年以前，哲学系的学生就组织了扫盲队去联丰农业社帮助社里扫盲、读报，同时参加一些体力劳动。三年多来，同学们不管天寒地冻、刮风下雨，坚持到社里教农民识字学文化，不少社员感动地说：“人家大学生不怕冷不怕冻，老远跑来教咱们，咱们不好好学还行？”现在，有的过去连报纸都不能看的社员，已能给海甸区小报写稿了。
    去年，哲学系的师生组织了十三个义务劳动小队，分别与农业社十三个小组建立了直接联系挂上了钩，经常定期参加他们的劳动。今年寒假，又有一批同学去农业社和社员同吃、同住、同劳动一个星期。刘世铨和杜镇远等同学在谈他们参加劳动后的收获时说：我们除了向农民学习勤劳、朴实、节俭的品质外，还学到了一些生产技术常识，增加了自己的实际知识。社员们也兴奋地说：北大哲学系师生来帮我们把三十多亩荒地和六十多亩旱地变成了水田；还教我们学文化、唱歌、排戏；还送给我们一部双轮双铧犁和一台七匹半马力的电动机，……有的老社员也感动地说：过去燕京大学的学生看到我们都掩着鼻子，嫌我们臭，今天北大学生却来和我们一起翻大粪、挖泥，毛主席教导的大学生就是好！
    勤工俭学活动展开了，学校决定哲学系和联丰农业社建立固定的联系。（附图片）
