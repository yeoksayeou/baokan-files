Who Says There Are No Phoenixes in the World?
——A Review of the Film "Song of the Phoenix"
Ma Shaobo

"Song of the Phoenix" is a film rich in life content. Its first shot is full of legendary charm: a deep mountain waterfall, towering misty trees, an old shepherd sitting on an ancient pine tree on the mountain, singing a mountain song loudly. Then, at the foot of this mountain, a story of a child bride turning over appears. Through this story, it reflects the new face of the Chinese countryside and praises the correctness and greatness of the Party.

From the very beginning, the film's creators placed this girl, named Jinfeng, in intense struggles for tempering, and portrayed her in significant conflicting plots. Although the writing progresses from light to strong, from shallow to deep; it always places the heroine at the focal point of every contradiction and struggle, making the character's image vivid and touching, generating a moving power. A girl, who left her parents at a young age to become a child bride, suffered a lot; her parents-in-law, with strong feudal ideas, did not treat her as a human being; her fiancé also "abandoned" her. What was her future? Where was her destination? She almost faced the same tragic fate as Liu Lanzhi in "Peacock Flies Southeast"; but the times had changed, the Communist Party had come, the Party rescued her from the sea of suffering, helped her study, supported her struggle, and made her stand up and embark on the road to freedom and happiness. Moreover, it wasn't just Jinfeng who was like this, all kind farmers were changing and advancing; all evil forces and traditional old ideas were on the verge of destruction!

The film's depiction of life is rich and vivid. Under the leadership of the Party, the peasants of Lizhuang and Wuzhuang finally resolved the feuds planted for generations by vying for water, and jointly embarked on the road of collectivization. The author not only reflects the sharp struggle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside through such important clues. At the same time, he also pays considerable attention to the necessary detailed descriptions and the use of language, carefully portraying the characters. For example, the dialogue between female cadre Wang Qi and Jinfeng when they first met, with a few light strokes, expresses the inferiority complex and timid, apprehensive state of life of a child bride. Furthermore, in the scene where Jinfeng washes clothes by the river and Wang Qi also goes to help her wash, the dialogue is as poetic, concise, implicit, expressive, and infectious as possible; coupled with the excellent performances of comrades Zhang Ruifang, Li Ming, Kang Tai, etc., the artistic charm is even enhanced. In particular, Zhang Ruifang, it can be seen that she has shaped the simple, gentle, yet strong and brave image of Jinfeng through painstaking efforts.

The film also has some obvious weaknesses:

First, in reflecting political struggles, it reveals a right-leaning mood that makes people feel suppressed and unhappy. For example, Li Yuanmin, Li Xiaomao, and other bad elements and saboteurs, run rampant in the countryside and have reached the point of being lawless. Why not suppress them earlier? Jinfeng has already become the production team leader, why is she repeatedly subjected to violent insults by bad elements, and can still swallow her anger and allow them to run amok? This not only damages Jinfeng's image; but also weakens the Party's leadership role and the strength of the masses.

Second, it is not clear what Jinfeng's in-law's family background is. The film states that it is a family of workers and farmers, but the thoughts and behaviors of her parents-in-law are very much like bankrupt landlords. Of course, some traditional old ideas of some peasants can be criticized, but the effect seems to be excessive. This is almost a common problem in some works, in order to set off the protagonist's "hard struggle," some objective difficulties are inappropriately exaggerated in the presentation.

Third, it seems unnecessary to arrange Jinfeng's fiancé to be of worker origin. Although child brides come from "parents' orders," separation or reunion cannot be understood abstractly. From the film's perspective, Jinfeng still loves her husband quite sincerely; on the other hand, if she is truly such a beautiful woman as Jinfeng, her husband would also like her, then why is it that although the two have a living basis for combination, they must separate? In the film, this worker who has never appeared is really a bit wronged. I think, if her fiancé was treated as the son of a landlord or rich peasant, or even simply treated as dead, it would not affect the development of the plot, but would be more reasonable and profound.

These weaknesses do have an impact on the ideological and artistic quality of the work, but they do not obscure its brilliance. Because, it always sends out an eloquent voice to people: "Who says there are no phoenixes in the world!" The phoenix has finally flown out, and this power that encourages people to move upwards should be fully estimated.

### 谁说人间无凤凰？——评影片“凤凰之歌”

    谁说人间无凤凰？
    ——评影片“凤凰之歌”
    马少波
    “凤凰之歌”是一部富有生活内容的影片。它的第一个镜头，就很有传奇性的魅力：深山飞瀑，参差烟树，一个牧羊的老人坐在山上一棵古松下面，高声唱着山歌。接着，就在这座山下，出现了一个童养媳翻身的故事。通过这个故事，反映了中国农村的新面貌，歌颂了党的正确和伟大。
    影片创作者从一开始就把这个叫作金凤的姑娘，放在紧张的斗争中去磨炼，放在重大冲突的情节中去表现。虽然着笔是由淡而浓，由浅而深；但总是把这个女主人公放在每个矛盾斗争的焦点，使人物的形象鲜明生动，发生感动人的力量。一个女孩子，从小就离开了自己的父母，给人家当童养媳，受苦；带有浓厚封建思想的公婆，不把她当人看待；未婚的丈夫又把她“遗弃”了，她的前途是什么？她的归宿又在那里呢？她几乎面临着像“孔雀东南飞”中的刘兰芝一样悲惨的命运；但是时代变了，共产党来了，党从苦海里拯救了她，帮助她学习，扶持她斗争，使她挺身站起来走上自由幸福的道路。而且不只金凤一个人是这样，一切善良的农民都在变化着，前进着；一切恶势力、传统的旧意识都在趋于破灭！
    影片的生活色彩是丰富的，鲜明的。李庄和吴庄的农民在党的领导下，终于消解了世世辈辈为争水种下的仇隙，共同走上合作化的道路。作者既通过这样重要的线索，反映了农村社会主义和资本主义的尖锐斗争。同时，也相当注重于必要的细节描写和语言的运用，细致地刻画了人物。例如女干部王琦和金凤最初见面时的对话，淡淡几笔，就把一个童养媳的自卑心理和畏缩惶惑的生活状态表现了出来。再如：金凤在河边洗衣服，王琦也去帮她洗这一场戏，对话也像诗一样的精萃、含蓄、传神、有感染力量；加以演员张瑞芳、李明、康泰等同志优秀的表演，就更增强了艺术的魅力。特别是张瑞芳，看得出来她是以刻苦的努力塑造了金凤这个朴实温良而又坚强勇敢的妇女形象的。
    影片也有一些明显的弱点：
    一、在反映政治斗争中，表现出一种使人压抑不快的右倾情绪。例如李远民、李小毛这些坏分子、破坏分子，在农村中横行霸道，已经到了无法无天的地步，为什么不早一些进行镇压？金凤已经成为生产队长了，为甚么三番两次地遭到坏分子的暴力侮辱，居然可以忍气吞声，任其胡作非为？这一点不但对金凤这一形象有所损伤；而且也削弱了党的领导作用和群众的力量。
    二、金凤的婆家是什么成份看不清楚。影片说明是工人和农民的家庭，可是她的公婆的思想行为，却很像破落地主。对于有的农民某些传统的旧意识，当然是可以加以针砭的，但从效果看起来，未免过分了。这在某些作品中几乎是一种通病，为了衬托主人公的“艰苦奋斗”，而把某些客观困难在表现上作了不恰当的夸张。
    三、把金凤的未婚夫安排成工人成份，似乎是不必要的。童养媳，虽是出于“父母之命”，但是或离或合，不能作抽象的理解。从影片看，金凤还是相当真挚地爱她的丈夫的；另方面，假如真是像金凤这样美好的女性，她的丈夫也会喜欢她，那末为什么两者有可以结合的生活基础，却非离开不可呢？在影片里这位没有出过场的工人，实在有点冤枉。我想，假如把她的未婚夫处理成地主或是富农的儿子，甚至索性处理成死了，并不影响剧情的发展，反而更合理，更深刻些。
    这些弱点，对作品的思想性、艺术性是有影响的，却没有掩盖了它的光彩。因为，它总是向人们发出了雄辩的声音：“谁说人间无凤凰”！凤凰终于飞出来了，这种鼓舞人们向上的力量，是应该充分估计的。
