Xinhua News Agency, March 14th, Moscow (TASS dispatch, March 13th): The Soviet government issued a statement fully supporting the new initiative proposed by Pham Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in his letter to the South Vietnamese authorities on March 7th of this year, regarding the resolution of the current situation in Vietnam.

The statement said that the Soviet government firmly advocates the thorough and resolute implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam. Its starting point is that the unification of Vietnam according to the principles of the Final Declaration of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina is a major condition for lasting peace in Indochina and will also help consolidate peace in Southeast Asia.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam already expressed its willingness in June 1955 to hold consultative conferences between plenipotentiary representatives of the two parts of Vietnam's government in order to prepare for general elections to unify the country. The Soviet government and the British government, representing the two co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, jointly expressed their support for conducting the aforementioned consultations. However, until today, the above-mentioned consultations have not been held, and the general elections have not taken place. Vietnam remains in a state of division.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet government agrees with the view of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government that the main reason for this abnormal situation is foreign interference in the affairs of South Vietnam, with foreign attempts to turn South Vietnam into a military springboard primarily against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. The well-known activities carried out by the United States in the militarization of South Vietnam, the continuous supply of arms and ammunition by the United States to this part of Vietnam, and the attempt to pull it into the so-called "activity area" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are all dangerous steps not only for the Vietnamese people but also for maintaining peace in the Southeast Asian region.

In contrast, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has reduced its armed forces by 80,000, cut military spending, and is constantly seeking ways to normalize relations between the two parts of Vietnam. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is now proposing to the South Vietnamese authorities that meetings between plenipotentiary representatives of both sides be arranged in the near future to jointly discuss the issue of reducing their armed forces and to study ways to establish trade between the North and South, so that this approach can help bring the two parts closer together and create conditions for consultations in order to hold elections so that Vietnam can be unified on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

The statement said: The Soviet government fully supports this new initiative of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and believes that it is an important step towards building the necessary trust between the North and South of Vietnam, thereby peacefully unifying Vietnam. The declaration by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of its willingness to take the above-mentioned measures is undoubtedly a contribution to the efforts of the peoples of all countries to end the "Cold War," ease international tensions, and ensure peaceful coexistence and international cooperation.

The Soviet government believes that the proposals of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as stated in Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's letter of March 7, are fully in line with the national interests of the entire Vietnamese people. Adopting this proposal will guarantee the resolution of economic issues of concern to both parts of Vietnam and improve the living standards of the Vietnamese people.

The Soviet government hopes that this proposal will receive a positive response from the South Vietnamese authorities and the governments of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, including the United States, as well as the governments of all relevant countries. The vital interests of the Vietnamese people and the cause of peace in Indochina demand that foreign interference in the affairs of South Vietnam be stopped, and that friendly cooperation between the two parts of Vietnam be fully promoted, so that Vietnam can be unified into a nationally independent country in accordance with the Geneva Accords.

    越南应按日内瓦协议实现统一
    苏联政府声明支持范文同建议
    斥责美国供给南越当局军火破坏亚洲和平
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日电：苏联政府发表声明，完全支持越南民主共和国总理范文同在今年3月7日写给南越当局一封信里提出的解决当前越南局势的新倡议。
    声明说，苏联政府坚决主张彻底坚决地实现关于越南的日内瓦协议。它的出发点是，按照1954年关于印度支那的日内瓦会议最后宣言的原则统一越南，是印度支那持久和平的主要条件，并且也将有助于巩固东南亚的和平。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府已经在1955年6月表示愿意举行越南两部分政权全权代表的协商会议，以便准备普选来统一国家。苏联政府和英国政府曾经代表关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席共同表示赞同进行上述协商。但是直到今天上述协商一直没有举行，普选也没有举行。越南现在仍旧处于分裂状态。
    声明指出，苏联政府同意越南民主共和国政府的这种看法：这种不正常状态的主要原因是外国对南越事务的干涉，外国企图把南越变成首先反对越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国的军事跳板。美国在南越军国主义化方面所进行的众所周知的活动，美国不断给越南这一部分提供军火和弹药，企图把它拉进所谓东南亚条约组织的“活动地区”，这一切不仅对越南人民、而且对维护东南亚地区的和平事业都是危险的步骤。
    与此相反，越南民主共和国政府裁减了武装部队八万人，削减了军事开支，并且在经常寻求使越南两部分关系正常化的办法。越南民主共和国政府现在向南越当局提出建议：在最近期间安排双方当局全权代表的会晤，以便共同讨论裁减它们武装部队的问题和研究建立南北两部分互通贸易的办法，使得这种作法有助于南北两部分的接近，创造条件促成协商，以便举行选举，使越南在日内瓦协议的基础上统一起来。
    声明说：苏联政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府的这项新倡议，并且认为它是建立越南南北两部分之间的必要信任从而和平统一越南的重要步骤。越南民主共和国政府宣布愿意采取上述措施，无疑地是对各国人民终止“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势以及保证和平共处和国际合作的努力的一个贡献。
    苏联政府认为，范文同总理3月7日的信中所陈述的越南民主共和国政府的建议完全符合全越南人民的民族利益。采纳这项建议就能保证解决越南两部分所关心的经济问题和提高越南居民的生活水平。
    苏联政府希望，这项建议将能得到南越当局和包括美国在内的关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加国政府以及各有关国家政府的积极响应。越南人民的切身利益和印度支那的和平事业要求：停止外国对南越事务的干涉，全力促进越南两部分的友好合作，从而使越南能按照日内瓦协议统一成一个民族独立的国家。
