    Vietnam - Algeria: People Heart to Heart
    By Our Correspondent Chen Jiabao
    The mother of the famous Vietnamese heroine, Ms. Mo Thi Dieu, who was killed by French colonialists, recently wrote a letter to Djamila Bouhired, a patriotic Algerian young woman, praising her for being as坚贞不屈[steadfast and unyielding] in front of the French colonialists today as Ms. Mo Thi Dieu was in her day. The old lady said in her letter that Ms. Mo Thi Dieu was twenty-three years old when she died heroically, the same age as Djamila this year. She deeply felt how similar the suffering of the Algerian people today is to that of the Vietnamese people in the past. She said, "I deeply understand the pain you and the Algerian people are suffering," "I firmly demand the restoration of your freedom!" She also expressed her determination to actively participate in the struggle to support Algeria. The words of the heroine's mother are the heartfelt voice of millions of Vietnamese people.
    For a century, the French colonialists' cruel exploitation of Algeria and Vietnam has created a deep feeling of sympathy and support between these two nations, thousands of miles apart, in the common cause of opposing aggressors. During the days of the resistance war, when the French colonial army, equipped with American weapons, massacred the Vietnamese people, workers in the distant Algerian capital preferred to go hungry rather than carry weapons for the French army to kill their own “brothers,” and many Algerian youths refused to serve as soldiers for France. Today, the people of North Vietnam, who have won victory, have great respect for the Algerian independence struggle and give it enthusiastic support. Last April, in just seven days, the activities of "Vietnam People's Support Algeria Struggle Week" were like a touching poem. Within seven days, the people of Hanoi and other parts of the North actively participated in the movement to support the Algerian people. People organized more than 300 report meetings to publicize the just struggle of Algeria. Young people and workers, led by the heads of the Youth League, went to the streets to sell newspapers, and women sold flowers to donate to Algeria. Painters painted more than 2,000 propaganda paintings within a few days. People from all directions sent thousands of gifts and tens of thousands of letters to Hanoi to be transferred to the Algerian people. The authors of these letters included elders over half a century old and Young Pioneers who had just put on their red scarves. Some young people bit their fingers to write letters to the Algerian people to express their determination to support them, and some girls specially embroidered silk scarves for Algerian women to express sisterly feelings.
    Nearly a year later—today, March 30—the Vietnamese capital and other places are once again swept into the boiling activities of "Support Algeria Day." Red and yellow banners can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys of Hanoi today. This morning, 40,000 people gathered in the rain in the Grand Theatre and Square to pay tribute to their "brothers" in the distance. People shouted enthusiastically, "Algeria must be independent!" "Vietnam must be unified!" Today, at the Haiphong port wharf, a group of stevedores are donating their overtime income. A worker representative said at the Hanoi mass meeting: "The pain of the Algerian people is our pain, and the victory of the Algerian people is our victory." This fully reflects the deep feelings of the Vietnamese people towards Algeria.

    越南——阿尔及利亚人民心连心
    本报记者　陈家保
    被法国殖民者杀害的越南著名女英雄莫氏柚的母亲莫氏亲最近写信给阿尔及利亚爱国女青年加米拉·布依海德，赞扬她今天在法国殖民者面前也像莫氏柚当年一样的坚贞不屈。老大娘在信中说，莫氏柚慷慨就义的那一年正是二十三岁，同加米拉今年一样大。她老人家深深感到今天的阿尔及利亚人民同当年的越南人民的苦难是多么相似。她说：“我深深体会你和阿尔及利亚人民所忍受的痛苦”，“我坚决要求恢复你的自由！”她还表示一定积极参加支援阿尔及利亚的斗争。女英雄的母亲的话正是千千万万越南人民的心声。
    一个世纪以来，法国殖民者对阿尔及利亚和越南的残酷压榨，使这两个遥隔万里的民族在反对侵略者的共同事业中互相同情和支持，从而建立了深厚的感情。在抗战的日子里，当以美国武器装备的法国殖民军队屠杀越南人民的时候，在遥远的阿尔及利亚首都的工人宁愿挨饿也不肯替法军搬运武器来杀害自己的
  “兄弟”，许多阿尔及利亚青年拒绝为法国当兵。今天，胜利了的越南北方人民对阿尔及利亚的独立斗争怀着很大的敬意，并给予热情的支援。去年4月，在短短的七天中，“越南人民支持阿尔及利亚斗争周”的活动有如一首扣人心弦的诗篇。七天内，河内和北方各地人民都纷纷参加了支援阿尔及利亚人民的运动，人们为宣传阿尔及利亚的正义斗争而组织了三百多个报告会。青年和工人们在青年团负责人的带领下到大街上卖报，妇女们卖花，为阿尔及利亚捐献。画家们几天之内画出了二千多幅宣传画。人们从四面八方寄到河内成千件转赠阿尔及利亚人民的礼物和成万封信。这些信件的作者有年过半百的长者，也有刚带上红领巾的少先队员。有些青年咬破指头写信向阿尔及利亚人民表示对他们支持的决心，也有些少女特地为阿尔及利亚妇女亲手刺绣纱绢表示姊妹般的情谊。
    将近一年后的今天——3月30日，越南首都和各地又一次卷入到“声援阿尔及利亚日”的沸腾活动里。河内大街小巷今天随处可以见到红底黄字的标语，四万人今晨冒雨汇集在大戏院、广场，向远方的“兄弟”遥致敬意，人们激昂高呼“阿尔及利亚一定要独立！”“越南一定要统一！”今天在海防港码头上，有一批搬运工人正在捐献他们的加班收入。一位工人代表在河内群众大会上说：“阿尔及利亚人民的痛苦就是我们的痛苦，阿尔及利亚人民的胜利就是我们的胜利。”这充分反映了越南人民对阿尔及利亚的深厚感情。
