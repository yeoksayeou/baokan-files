Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, Washington Dispatch: According to American newspaper reports, sharp divisions have emerged within the American ruling class regarding the economic recession.

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" published a commentary on the 24th by columnist Drew Pearson titled "Recession Splits Cabinet," stating that the Eisenhower cabinet has been divided into two groups on how to deal with the recession. Most cabinet members advocate a "go slow" approach, opposing hasty measures before mid-May. These individuals prefer to "gamble" on the American economy "recovering" on its own from the recession. They fear that taking tax cuts now will cause a chain reaction, unbalancing the budget and leading to rising prices and more severe inflation. The architect of this "wait-and-see" policy is White House economic advisor Hauge, who is supported by Adams, the President's Special Assistant, the most powerful figure in the White House on domestic issues. In addition, Treasury Secretary Anderson, Federal Reserve Chairman Martin, Commerce Secretary Weeks, and Agriculture Secretary Benson also belong to this group.

The other faction advocates immediate action. This group includes Labor Secretary Mitchell and Interior Secretary Seaton. While cautious, the President's chief economic advisor, Saulnier, also advocates taking some anti-recession measures. This "immediate action" group is concerned that the current recession already shows signs of being "much more serious" than the recessions of 1948-49 and 1953-54.

Pearson also pointed out that as the economic recession develops, the mutual attacks between the two parties are becoming increasingly fierce. For example, the Republican government and the Democrats once agreed to a "truce" on the issue of tax cuts, agreeing that neither side would mention tax cuts, but this "truce" soon broke down.

The "New York Times" also published an article by Krock on the 23rd, saying, "On the recession front, the truce between the two parties has ended. The Democrats have launched a fierce attack on the Republican government's handling of economic problems." Krock said that Democratic Senate Leader Johnson is currently directly criticizing Eisenhower, and House Speaker Rayburn is also using some harsh words to comment on the President's activities. Krock pointed out that it has now entered a "fierce stage of partisan struggle for votes and positions."

Xinhua News Agency, March 28th, New York Dispatch: The "New York Times" published an article on the 23rd stating: "Private capitalist economies must have business recessions. In the past hundred years, the United States has experienced about twenty-four times. The cyclical nature of business booms and busts seems to have become a largely unavoidable reality of life."

This article, which acknowledges that economic crisis is a chronic disease of the capitalist system, expresses great concern about the current US economic recession. It believes that whether the government can take measures to overcome the current severe recession is a current "extremely severe test." The article lists the following statistics to compare the situation in the first seven months of the recent US economic recessions and economic crises:

                                  Index of Industrial Production　Decline in Non-Agricultural Employment
                                   Degree of Decline　　　　　Degree of Reduction
    July 1957 - February 1958　           9.7%　　　　　　　3.1%
    First 7 months of 1953-1954 recession　8%-9%　　　　　　2.3%
    First 7 months of 1948-1949 recession　8%-9%　　　　　　3.3%
    First 7 months of 1929 crisis　            13.1%　　　　　　5.4%

    美经济衰退中矛盾百出
    内阁发生分歧  两党争吵激烈
    美报承认经济衰退是资本主义的痼疾
    据新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国报刊报道，美国统治集团内部在经济衰退问题上发生尖锐的分歧。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”24日以“衰退使内阁陷于分裂”为题刊载专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊的一篇评论说，艾森豪威尔内阁对于如何应付衰退已经分裂为两个集团。大多数阁员主张“慢慢来”，他们反对在5月中旬以前急忙采取措施。这些人宁愿进行这样的“赌博”：让美国经济自行从衰退中“恢复过来”。他们担心现在就采取减税措施将会引起连锁反应，使得预算不能平衡，并且导致物价上升和更加严重的通货膨胀。这种“等着瞧”的政策的拟订人是白宫经济顾问豪吉，他得到了白宫在内政问题上最强有力的人物、总统特别助理亚当斯的支持。此外，财政部长安德逊、联邦储备局局长马丁、商业部长威克斯和农业部长本逊等人也属于这个集团。
    另一派人却主张立即行动。这批人包括劳工部长密契尔、内政部长西顿。总统的首席经济顾问骚尼尔虽然态度谨慎，但也主张采取一些反衰退措施。这个“立即行动”集团所担忧的是：目前的衰退已经有迹象说明比1948—49年和1953—54年的衰退要“严重得多”。
    皮尔逊还指出，随着经济衰退的发展，两党之间的互相攻讦也越来越激烈。例如共和党政府和民主党人曾经一度协议就减税问题实行“休战”，同意大家都不提减税问题，但是这个“休战”不久就宣告破裂。
    “纽约时报”23日也刊载克罗克一篇文章说，“在衰退问题的战线上，两党的休战已经结束。民主党对共和党政府对经济问题的处理展开了剧烈的攻击”。克罗克说，民主党参议院领袖约翰逊目前正在对艾森豪威尔进行直接的批评，众议院议长雷朋也正在用一些刻薄的字眼来评论总统的活动。克罗克就此指出，现在已经进入了两个“党派之间争夺选票和职位的激战阶段”。
    新华社28日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”23日发表一篇文章说：“私人资本主义经济要有企业衰退。在过去一百年里，美国就发生过大约二十四次。企业盛衰的周期性看来已经成为一个大概无法逃避的生活现实”。
    这篇承认经济危机是资本主义制度的痼疾的文章对目前的美国经济衰退表示很大的忧虑。它认为政府能否采取措施来克服目前的严重衰退，这是当前的一个“极其严酷的考验”。这篇文章列举了下列统计数字，来对比美国最近几次经济衰退和经济危机在开头七个月的情况：
                                  工业生产指数　非农业就业人数
                                   下降程度　减少程度
    1957年7月——1958年2月　           9.7％　3.1％
    1953年——1954年衰退的头七个月　8％—9％　2.3％
    1948年——1949年衰退的头七个月　8％—9％　3.3％
    1929年危机的头七个月　            13.1％　5.4％
