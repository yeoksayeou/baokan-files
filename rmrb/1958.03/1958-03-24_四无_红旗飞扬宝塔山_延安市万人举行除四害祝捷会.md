    "Four-Without" Red Flag Flies Over Pagoda Hill
    Yan'an City Holds Victory Meeting for Eliminating the Four Pests
    (Our newspaper Yan'an dispatch, March 22nd) After six days and six nights of fierce attack and search, the victory flag of "Four-Without" is already flying throughout Yan'an City. The people of Yan'an used the same spirit they had eleven years ago when fighting Hu Zongnan to carry out this battle. In March 1947, Hu's bandits invaded Yan'an, followed by the heroic People's Army launching a series of famous and victorious battles near Yan'an. This March, in Yan'an, the heroic people launched another annihilation battle against the four pests. On the evening of the 14th, the Yan'an Four Pests Elimination Headquarters issued a seven-day, seven-night combat order to more than 20,000 people in the city via the broadcasting station to eliminate the four pests. On the 15th, hundreds of shock brigades were formed throughout the city and投入战斗. On the night of the 18th, the leading organs held an emergency meeting and decided to mobilize all the people to complete the combat mission in three days and three nights. On the morning of the 19th, various units held mobilization rallies, and then the annihilation battle fully blossomed. The sound of gunfire to kill sparrows was heard everywhere on the riverside and in the mountains; groups of people digging up fly pupae were everywhere near toilets and manure piles; weeds and sewage pits near cave dwellings and houses were all cleared and leveled; and manure and garbage were all cleared away. Many people scouted during the day and made surprise attacks at night, catching sparrows and blocking rat holes. On the night of the 19th, the mountains were still full of lights and shouts. In just one day, the four pests in the city were basically eliminated. On the 20th, a major inspection was carried out while mopping up the remaining enemies. On the morning of the 21st, the battlefield continued to be cleaned. In the afternoon,锣鼓喧天 everywhere, and flags and reports of victory flowed from all directions towards the People's Stadium at the foot of Pagoda Hill with the crowd. More than 10,000 people cheered and danced, holding a victory meeting for eliminating the four pests. Countless strings of rat and sparrow corpses hung in the venue, and people held up statistical charts of the battle results. At 5:35, the conference solemnly announced that the revolutionary sacred land of Yan'an has become a "Four-Without" city from now on. The sound of gongs and drums rang out throughout the venue. The conference announced the results of the battle and also declared that the patriotic health campaign must be regularized in the future. Yan'an County will achieve "Four-Without" before the end of April to offer a gift to the May Day celebration. (Yan Ling)
