Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 29th: The No. 1 blast furnace at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created a new record on the 28th by producing one ton of pig iron per 0.577 cubic meters of effective volume. This achievement surpassed the national record of 0.583 utilization coefficient set by Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 4 blast furnace on the 24th, increasing pig iron production by 4% with all products meeting quality standards.

The No. 1 blast furnace at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has old equipment and low iron content ore. However, the employees of this blast furnace proposed to not focus on the equipment's advantages and disadvantages, and to catch up with Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of production indicators. Recently, they learned Anshan Iron and Steel's methods of reducing humidity and increasing the temperature of dry air, which increased the coke blast load in the furnace and significantly reduced the utilization coefficient. In the past, the sintered ore contained high iron oxide, consuming too much heat in the blast furnace. The party secretary of the workshop and other leaders carried out "experimental plots" in the sintering section, helping workers improve operating methods from batching and material leakage to heating, significantly improving the quality of the sintered ore and ensuring smooth blast furnace production.

    太原钢铁厂一号高炉
    利用系数超过鞍钢
    据新华社太原29日电　太原钢铁厂一号高炉，在28日创造了零点五七七立方公尺的有效容积出一吨生铁的新纪录。这一成就赶过了鞍钢四号高炉在24日创造的利用系数零点五八三的全国新纪录，使生铁产量比过去增加了4％，质量全部合格。
    太原钢铁厂一号高炉设备古老，矿石含铁量低。但是，这座高炉的职工提出不讲设备优劣，要在生产指标上赶上鞍钢。最近，他们学习了鞍钢减少湿度、提高干风温度的办法，使炉内焦爆负荷提高，利用系数显著降低。过去烧结矿所含氧化铁高，消耗高炉热量过多。车间的党委书记和其他领导干部在烧结工段搞“试验田”，帮助工人从配料、漏料到加热都改进了操作方法，烧结矿的质量有了显著提高，使高炉生产顺利。
