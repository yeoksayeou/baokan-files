    Old Matters to be Handled in a New Way

    Here's a very interesting story for you. In Baizhuang Agricultural Cooperative, Chengguan Township, Ningjin County, Hebei Province, there was an old cooperative member named Liu Ruiqing, who unfortunately passed away recently due to old age and declining health.

    Before his death, the old man called his children to his bedside and asked, "After I die, how do you plan to bury me?" His daughter-in-law said, "Dad, don't worry! Now that life is better, you have worked hard all your life, we must not mistreat you. We must get you a cypress coffin and buy you first-class burial clothes..." The old man shook his head. His granddaughter-in-law said, "Grandpa has always liked listening to singing, we should hire several good wind instrument players!" The old man still shook his head, then asked his son, "Xudong, what do you plan to do?" The son thought for a moment and said with difficulty, "How about setting up a shed for a grand funeral!" The old man scolded as soon as he heard this, "Are you still a cadre!" At this point, the family was at a loss and had to ask, "Dad, what do you think is best?" The old man had people help him up, and said breathlessly, "After I die, ‘old matters must be handled in a new way’. Don't buy burial clothes, don't buy paper, don't buy incense, don't buy cloth, don't hire coffin carriers, don't hire wind instrument players. Don't burn incense or paper. Just change me into a clean set of casual clothes. Put the money saved into the cooperative to increase production a little bit!" He was afraid people wouldn't remember, so he had his son write down his words and read them back to him. After listening, he added, "Don't send a letter to Huasheng (his grandson, who works in a factory in Beijing)." When asked what he meant, he said, "The factory is having a red flag competition, telling him would affect production!" After the old man finished speaking, he closed his eyes with a smile.

    After the old man died, Liu Xudong took his father's will to discuss it with the branch. The branch unanimously praised the old man's spirit of diligence, thrift, and love for the cooperative, and supported Xudong in handling the funeral according to his father's will. As a result, it only took a morning and a few yuan to complete the funeral.

    临终赠良言
    老事要新办
    这里告诉你一件很有意思的事情。河北省宁津县城关乡白庄农业社里，有个七十三岁的老社员，名叫刘瑞清。在前些天，不幸因年老体衰病故了。
    这位老人在临死之前，把他的孩子们叫到床前，问道：“我死后，你们打算怎么埋我？”儿媳说：“爹，您放心吧！现在日子好了，您老人家辛苦了一辈子，绝不能亏了您，一定要给您办一个柏木棺材，买身头等寿衣……。”老头听了摇摇头。孙媳说：“爷爷向来好听唱的，要多雇几个好吹手！”老头仍是摇头，接着问儿子：“旭东，你打算怎么办？”儿子想了一下，为难地说：“要不，搭棚出大殡！”老头一听骂道：“亏你还是个干部！”这一来，一家人都不摸门了，只好问道：“爹，您看怎么办好？”老头让人们扶起他来，气吁吁地说：“我死后，要‘老事新办’。不买寿衣，不买纸，不买香，不买布，不雇杠，不雇吹手。不许烧香烧纸。给我换上一身干净便衣就行。把省下的钱，投到社里，给生产增加一分力量！”他还怕人们记不住，又叫儿子把他的话写下来念给他听，听完又补充说：“不要给华胜（他的孙子，在北京工厂做工）去信。”别人问他什么意思，他说：“工厂里正闹红旗竞赛，告诉他会影响生产！”这位老人把话说完，才微笑着合上眼睛。
    老人死后，刘旭东拿着父亲的遗嘱去找支部商量。支部一致称赞这位老人勤俭、爱社的精神，并支持旭东按照父亲的遗嘱办理。结果只用了一早上的时间，花了几元钱就把这件丧事办完了。
