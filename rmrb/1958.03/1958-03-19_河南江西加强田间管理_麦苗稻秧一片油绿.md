    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th: In Henan Province, more than 80 million mu of wheat fields are already a patch of green. On the 16th, the province experienced another widespread welcome rain of 20 to 30 millimeters, and the drought-stricken wheat fields have been moistened, which will promote wheat growth. After this welcome rain, Party and government leaders at all levels in Henan immediately mobilized millions of people to carry out soil moisture conservation work in wheat fields, including hoeing, harrowing, and rolling the wheat, striving for a bumper wheat harvest.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 18th: After overcoming two cold wave attacks, the more than 50,000 mu of early rice seedling fields in Jiangxi Province that were sown in advance are now a patch of tender green, with robust seedling growth, some seedlings reaching two or three inches in height.
    This year, Jiangxi Province plans to promote double-cropping rice and replace late-maturing mid-season rice with early rice on more than 37 million mu, an increase of more than 12 million mu compared to last year. In order to ensure early maturity and high yields of two rice crops and to solve the problem of labor shortage during the summer harvest and planting, spring sowing was brought forward by one to two solar terms compared to previous years. However, at the end of February and the beginning of March, the seedling fields sown before "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects) and "Chunfen" (Vernal Equinox) encountered two cold wave attacks. Various agricultural cooperatives immediately mobilized to prevent the cold. After overcoming the first natural disaster in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production, the farmers were even more encouraged and invigorated. According to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, it is expected that the province will complete the early rice sowing task on time a few days after "Chunfen." Now, agricultural cooperatives are strengthening the water storage management of water conservancy projects, preparing for spring irrigation and transplanting.

    河南江西加强田间管理
    麦苗稻秧一片油绿
    据新华社郑州18日电　河南省有八千多万亩麦田已经一片油绿。16日，全省又普降了二、三十公厘喜雨，干旱的麦地已经接墒，这对促进小麦生长将起到良好作用。在这次喜雨之后，河南各级党政领导立即发动千百万群众展开了以锄麦、耙麦、碾麦为内容的麦田保墒工作，争取小麦丰收。
    据新华社南昌18日电　在战胜两次寒潮袭击以后，江西省提前春播的五万多亩早稻秧田现在已是一片嫩绿，秧苗生长茁壮，部分秧苗有两三寸高了。
    今年江西省计划推广双季稻和晚中稻改早稻三千七百多万亩，比去年扩大一千二百多万亩。为了保证水稻两季早熟丰收，解决夏收夏种中劳动力不足的问题，春播比往年提早了一个到两个节气。但是，2月底和3月上旬，“惊蛰”和“春分”前播种的秧田遇到两次寒潮的袭击。各农业社立即紧急动员起来防寒。在战胜了今年农业生产大跃进中的第一次自然灾害以后，农民们更加鼓舞了信心和干劲。据江西省农业部门预计，“春分”后几天全省即可按时完成早稻播种任务。现在，农业社正在加强水利工程的蓄水管理，准备春灌插秧。
