    Advocate Mobile Factories
    Mobile factories have simple equipment, require little investment, are mobile and flexible, and have low costs. In the north, they can be pulled by vehicles, and in the south, they can be transported by boats. But such factories are a great boon to the broad masses of farmers. A large amount of labor and time can be saved, and many problems in production and life can be solved in a timely manner.
    At present, in terms of irrigation, cultivation, agricultural tool repair, grain processing...and so on, many farmers are hoping that such mobile factories will support them.
    Anything that is beneficial to agriculture and convenient for farmers should be actively done if it can be done. Establishing more mobile factories in a way that suits local conditions and the times is worthy of promotion everywhere.

    提倡流动工厂
    流动工厂，设备简单，投资很少，流动灵活，成本低廉。北方可以用车拉，南方可以用船运。但是这样的工厂，对于广大农民却是一大喜事。大量劳力和时间可以节省下来，生产和生活中的很多问题可以及时解决。
    现在，不论在灌溉方面，在耕作方面，在农具修理方面，在粮食加工方面……等等，很多农民都盼望着有这样的流动工厂去支援他们。
    凡是有利农业、便利农民的事，能办的都应该积极去办。因地制宜因时制宜地多办些流动工厂，值得在各地提倡。
