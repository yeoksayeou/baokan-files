Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, March 17th: The 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party opened in Ulaanbaatar this morning. After a brief opening speech, Damba, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered a work report of the Central Committee to the Congress.

In his opening speech, Damba, on behalf of the congress, paid tribute to the delegations of the thirteen fraternal parties, including the Soviet Union and China, who were invited to attend the congress.

Damba's work report of the Central Committee first discussed the international situation and Mongolia's foreign policy. He said that since the 12th Congress of the Party in 1954, great changes have taken place in the international situation. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has achieved historic and great victories and has become a reliable pillar of the world's forces for peace, democracy, and socialism, inspiring the fighting will of all progressive forces. He then spoke about the contributions of China and other socialist countries to the cause of peace and socialism.

Damba said that socialist countries are constantly strengthening their unity and friendly cooperation based on Marxist-Leninist doctrines and the principles of internationalism. The declaration issued by the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries has become a fighting program for the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism. The Peace Declaration has won the support of the people of the world.

Damba said that the Mongolian People's Republic adheres to a foreign policy of defending peace, strengthening friendship among countries, and striving for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence among countries with different social systems. It has now established diplomatic relations with countries representing more than half of the world's population and is willing to establish friendly relations with other countries at any time based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect.

He said that the Mongolian people fully sympathize with the just struggle of the oppressed people against imperialism for national liberation. The government of the Mongolian People's Republic supports the immediate holding of a summit conference of Eastern and Western countries and will make every effort to oppose the testing and use of atomic weapons to ease international tensions. Mongolia's peaceful foreign policy fully conforms to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and should become a member state of the United Nations.

In the second part of his report, Damba talked about the domestic situation in Mongolia, saying that the important achievement of Mongolia's construction during this period was the rapid development of socialist components in urban and rural areas, and Mongolia has changed from a purely pastoral country to an industrial, agricultural, and pastoral country.

He focused on reporting on agricultural and pastoral production and agricultural and pastoral cooperation. He said that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the number of livestock in Mongolia increased by 2.4%, and several thousand herdsmen households increased their livestock every year. The task of increasing the number of pastoral cooperatives ninefold has been overfulfilled. In 1952, only 5% of the total number of herding households in the country and 500,000 head of livestock participated in cooperatives. By 1957, the number of herding households joining the cooperatives had increased to 35%, and the number of livestock had reached 5.2 million. Together with the 540,000 head of livestock on state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms, the socialist economic component accounted for 25% of all livestock. Agricultural and pastoral cooperation is the only correct path for Mongolian herdsmen to enter a socialist and prosperous life. The herdsmen have embarked on this path with full confidence. He pointed out that at present, the tendency for cooperative members to keep too much private livestock should be corrected, and the cooperatives should be required to increase livestock and fully demonstrate the superiority of being organized.

He said that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the country's cultivated area expanded by 50%. In the future, yields should be further increased to complete the task of supplying most of the flour needed by the people of the country. He called on leading cadres to go deep into reality, master economic knowledge, and further lead agricultural and pastoral production well.

Damba said that the proportion of Mongolia's industrial production now accounts for 41% of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the total industrial output increased by 69%. In 1957, the average per capita output was 461 kilograms of coal, 80 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 6 kilograms of butter. During this period, a number of factories were expanded and newly built. State basic construction investment reached more than 590 million tugriks. Now the Mongolian working class accounts for 27% of the country's population. Railway and automobile transportation have increased 2.3 times in the past five years.

Damba said that there are now more than 100,000 students in Mongolian schools at all levels, and the plan for all school-age children to enroll has been completed. At the same time, more than 6,000 high- and middle-level cadres have been trained. In the future, graduates should be assigned to industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production for labor training in a planned manner.

Damba said that Mongolia's domestic sales of goods in 1957 increased by 95% compared with 1952, and foreign trade has also expanded. The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has taken many important measures to improve the people's material and cultural living standards. Over the past five years, the wages of employees have increased by 75%, and the actual income of herdsmen has increased by 60%. Housing and other welfare facilities have been built in cities and villages. The Mongolian government attaches importance to maternal and child health care, and the population growth rate has reached about 2% in five years.

In the last part of his report, Damba talked about the development of the Party. He said that the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has now become a genuine Marxist party that leads and organizes all aspects of Mongolian life. Party organizations and all party members unanimously support the two declarations of the Moscow Conference and are determined to realize the ideas of the declarations. In the cause of building socialism, the unity of the Mongolian Party is more consolidated than ever. He said that the Party now has 36,333 formal members and 6,563 probationary members. Workers account for 19.4% of party members, herdsmen account for 29%, and intellectuals account for 51.6%. 16.8% of party members are women. The number of worker party members has increased by 4.5% compared with the 12th Congress, indicating that more outstanding workers have joined the Party ranks.

Damba said that the scientific socialist ideology is increasingly attracting hundreds of millions of people around the world, but imperialist aggressors are attempting to use various opportunisms in the international workers' movement to carry out despicable activities. The most dangerous thing in the current international communist movement is revisionism. Defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and further consolidating the unity of the Party is an important task for the Communist and Workers' Parties. He criticized the revisionist tendencies and narrow nationalist ideas that had once appeared among some Mongolian intellectuals, as well as the dogmatic methods that were prevalent in Mongolian work.

Damba said that our Party has led the Mongolian people with Marxist-Leninist doctrines and has achieved considerable achievements. We should consolidate the achievements we have made, and we must give play to the enthusiasm of the working people to complete the tasks of the next three-year plan, further consolidate the socialist cause, and make contributions to defending world peace.

Damba's report lasted six hours.

    达姆巴在致开幕词时代表大会向应邀参加大会的苏联、中国等十三个兄弟党的代表团致敬。
    达姆巴所作的中央委员会的工作报告首先谈到国际形势和蒙古的对外政策。他说，自从1954年党的第十二次大会召开以来，国际形势发生了巨大变化，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营取得了历史性的巨大胜利，已经成为世界和平、民主和社会主义力量的可靠支柱，并且鼓舞着全体进步力量的斗争意志。接着他谈到中国和其他社会主义国家对和平和社会主义事业的贡献。
    达姆巴说，社会主义各国根据马克思、列宁主义学说和国际主义原则不断地加强团结和友好合作。社会主义各国共产党和工人党莫斯科代表会议发出的宣言已经成为为和平、民主、社会主义而斗争的战斗纲领。和平宣言得到了全世界人民的支持。
    达姆巴说，蒙古人民共和国遵循保卫和平、加强各国友好的外交政策和争取不同社会制度国家和平共处的五项原则，现在已经同全人类人口一半以上的国家建立了外交关系，并且愿意同其他国家在平等、互利、互相尊重的基础上随时建立友好关系。
    他说，蒙古人民完全同情被压迫人民为民族解放反对帝国主义而进行的正义斗争。蒙古人民共和国政府支持立即举行东西方国家首脑会议，并且将尽一切努力反对试验和使用原子武器以缓和国际紧张局势。蒙古的和平外交政策完全符合联合国的宗旨和原则，应该成为联合国的会员国。
    达姆巴在报告的第二部分谈到蒙古的国内情况时说，在这段时期里，蒙古建设事业的重要成就是城乡的社会主义成分有了迅速发展，蒙古已经从纯牧业国变成工业、农牧业国。
    他着重报告了农牧业生产和农牧业合作化的情况。他说，在第二个五年计划期间，蒙古的牲畜头数增加2.4％，有几千户牧民每年都增加了牲畜。把牧业合作社增加到九倍的任务，已经超额完成。1952年只有占全国总牧户5％的牧户和五十万头牲畜参加合作社，到1957年入社牧户已经增加到35％，牲畜达到五百二十万头，加上国营农牧场的五十四万头牲畜，社会主义经济成份的牲畜占全部牲畜的25％。农牧业合作化是蒙古牧民进入社会主义过富裕美好生活的唯一正确的道路。牧民已经满怀信心地走上了这条道路。他指出，目前应该纠正合作社社员自留牲畜过多的倾向，并且要求合作社增加牲畜，全面地显出组织起来的优越性。
    他说，第二个五年计划期间全国耕地面积扩大了50％，今后要进一步提高产量，完成供应全国人民大部分面粉需要的任务。他要求领导干部深入实际，掌握经济知识，进一步领导好农牧业生产。
    达姆巴说，蒙古的工业生产比重现在占工、农、牧业生产的41％，第二个五年计划期间工业总产量增加了69％，1957年按人口平均每人可得煤四百六十一公斤，电力八十瓩时，奶油六公斤。在此期间，扩建和新建了一批工厂。国家基本建设投资达五亿九千多万图格里克。现在蒙古的工人阶级已占全国人口的27％。五年来铁路、汽车运输增加到二·三倍。
    达姆巴说，蒙古各级学校现有十万多人，已经完成全部学龄儿童入学的计划。同时，培养了六千多名高、中级干部，今后要有计划地把毕业生分配到工、农、牧业生产中去进行劳动锻炼。
    达姆巴说，蒙古1957年国内货物销售额比1952年增加95％，对外贸易也有所扩大。蒙古人民革命党在提高人民物质文化生活水平方面采取了许多重要措施。五年来职工的工资增加了75％，牧民的实际收入增加了60％，在城市、乡村建设了住宅和其他福利设施。蒙古政府重视妇幼保健工作，五年内人口增殖率达到2％左右。
    达姆巴在报告的最后一部分谈到了党的发展情况。他说，蒙古人民革命党现在成为领导和组织蒙古一切生活的真正的马克思主义政党。党组织和全体党员一致拥护莫斯科会议的两个宣言，并且决心实现宣言的思想。在建设社会主义的事业中，蒙古党的团结一致比任何时候都巩固了。他说，党现有三万六千三百三十三名正式党员和六千五百六十三名预备党员。工人党员占19.4％，牧民党员占29％，知识分子占51.6％。党员中有16.8％是女党员。工人党员比十二次代表大会增加了4.5％，表明更多的优秀工人参加了党的队伍。
    达姆巴说，科学的社会主义思想越来越吸引着世界亿万人民，但是帝国主义侵略者企图利用国际工人运动中的各种机会主义进行卑鄙活动。目前国际共产主义运动中最危险的东西就是修正主义。保卫马克思—列宁主义的纯洁性、进一步巩固党的团结是共产党、工人党的重要任务。他批判了在蒙古部分知识分子中曾经出现过的修正主义倾向和狭隘民族主义思想以及在蒙古工作中普遍存在的教条主义方法。
    达姆巴说，我们党以马克思—列宁主义学说来领导蒙古人民，已经取得了不小的成就。我们应该巩固所得的成就，并且要为完成今后三年计划的任务发挥劳动人民的积极性，进一步巩固社会主义事业，并且为保卫世界和平作出贡献。
    达姆巴的报告历时六小时。
