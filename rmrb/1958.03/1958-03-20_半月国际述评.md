Bi-Weekly International Review
(March 4th to 18th)

In the past half-month, changes in the international situation have focused on three main aspects: First, on the issue of convening a summit meeting, the Soviet Union has taken successive steps to promote its early convocation; the United States' excuses for obstructing the meeting have been dismantled one after another, so it is trying to use a "golden cicada sheds its shell" trick, abandoning the summit meeting and using the issue of disarmament as a pretext to drag out the United Nations Disarmament Committee and the Security Council to divert the attention of people all over the world. Second, the economic recession in the United States is unstoppable, and the earlier claims by the US government that things would improve in March have been shattered. The US government is in a flurry, the people are alarmed, and this is affecting the entire capitalist world. Third, the Indonesian people are waging a resolute struggle against foreign interference, to defend the independence they have achieved, and to safeguard national sovereignty and integrity, against the rebellious groups that are acting as accomplices of the tiger. All righteous people around the world condemn the despicable conspiracy of imperialism and sympathize with and support the arduous struggle of the Indonesian people.

The Struggle Between Two Lines on the Summit Meeting Issue

From the important international documents published in March, people can see: the Soviet Foreign Minister's reply to French Foreign Minister Pineau on March 1st, the Soviet Union's memorandum to the US government on convening a summit meeting, Bulganin's letter to Eisenhower on March 3rd, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on March 14th condemning Western countries for obstructing the summit meeting, and the Soviet Foreign Ministry's suggestions on March 15th regarding prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes, removing foreign military bases on the territories of various countries, and conducting international cooperation in the study of outer space. These suggestions can be summarized into the following points:

First, regarding the preparation for the summit meeting, the Soviet Union believes that the agenda, date, location, and participating countries of the summit meeting can be studied through diplomatic channels or by convening a foreign ministers' meeting. This eliminates the excuse used by Western countries to obstruct the meeting by insisting on holding a foreign ministers' meeting to prepare for the summit meeting. The Soviet Union also specifically proposed holding a foreign ministers' meeting in April and a summit meeting in June.

Second, regarding the agenda of the meeting, the Soviet Union reiterated the issues that urgently need to be resolved to ease international tensions and for which the time is ripe, such as the prohibition of the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the adoption of mutually agreed measures by various countries to prevent sudden attacks, the signing of a non-aggression treaty between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization, the commencement of reductions in foreign troops stationed in Germany by both sides based on mutual agreement, the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, the cessation of war propaganda, ways to ease tensions in the Middle East, and the free development of international trade on the basis of mutual benefit. The Soviet Union also stated that as long as everyone agrees, the Soviet Union is willing to discuss any other suggestions made by countries participating in the meeting that are conducive to ending the Cold War (such as a peace treaty with Germany, peaceful use of outer space). At the same time, the Soviet Union solemnly rejected including the issues that the United States uses to interfere in the internal affairs of Eastern European socialist countries and Germany on the agenda.

Third, the Soviet Union considered Eisenhower's suggestion to discuss stopping the use of outer space for testing military rockets and stopping the production of weapons that use interplanetary space. In order to greatly reduce the danger of the outbreak of nuclear weapons war and seek the security of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries, it was suggested that the use of outer space for military purposes should be prohibited, while foreign military bases on the territories of various countries should be removed, and international cooperation should be conducted in the study of outer space.

In this way, the Soviet Union has eliminated all the excuses used by the United States to delay the meeting and opened the channels for convening a foreign ministers' meeting and a summit meeting. The Soviet Union's suggestions have been welcomed by world public opinion. However, the United States has come up with new tricks, attempting to fundamentally cancel the summit meeting. After the Soviet Union put forward new suggestions, Dulles commented that "he does not see any reason... why a summit meeting must be held," and he believes that "traditional diplomatic methods are a more reliable procedure than conducting business through meetings of heads of government." Echoing this, Western countries, regardless of the consultations being held on convening a summit meeting, used Western newspapers to promote the convening of the United Nations Disarmament Committee and to transfer the disarmament issue to the Security Council. What does this mean?

Everyone knows that the United Nations Disarmament Committee and Subcommittee have been working for many years. The members of these two committees are mostly participating countries of the Western military bloc, and they have long become organizations that use the guise of disarmament to cover up the arms race of Western countries. Therefore, after Western countries refused to expand the organization of the Disarmament Committee, the Soviet Union had already declared at the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly that it would no longer participate in the work of this committee. Western countries know that convening this committee is useless for disarmament, so why insist on convening such a meeting when actively preparing to hold a summit meeting? It is nothing more than to undermine the convening of a summit meeting. Therefore, after the Soviet Foreign Ministry exposed this conspiracy of Western countries, the US State Department issued a statement on the 15th, falsely accusing the Soviet Union of not being sincere in seeking to ease tensions. However, the people of the world will no longer be easily deceived by the empty talk of peace from Western countries.

On the issue of convening a summit meeting, the United States has the most stubborn attitude. Whenever the Soviet Union considers and accepts the suggestions put forward by the West, reducing differences, the United States creates new obstacles and takes a step backward. This approach of the United States has not only been met with increasingly strong condemnation from world public opinion, but it has also failed to achieve complete agreement with Britain and France. For example, on the issue of convening a foreign ministers' meeting, France agreed that the foreign ministers' meeting should only discuss procedural issues, not substantive issues. Of course, the United States will continue to resist the reasonable suggestions of the Soviet Union, continue to exert pressure on Britain and France, and create as many obstacles as possible to the convening of a summit meeting. However, its position is clearly becoming more and more difficult.

The Truth About US "Prosperity" Exposed, Economic Storm Spreads Across the Country

Why is the United States stubbornly undermining the summit meeting and afraid of the easing of the international situation? When the storm of economic recession has swept the country, at the special convention of the AFL-CIO on March 12th, AFL-CIO Vice President Reuther said: "More and more union members are studying this question: why can the United States only have economic prosperity and full employment during wartime?" This question from the vast number of union members reveals the truth about American prosperity. Making a fortune from war and engaging in an arms race are precisely the only ways for American monopoly capitalists to seize the highest profits. However, the United States is now reaping the consequences of its own actions.

The economic recession in the United States is becoming more and more serious.

The industrial production index, according to the Federal Reserve Board's announcement on March 17th, has fallen from 133 points in January to 130 points in February, reaching the lowest point in more than three years. "Economic activity continued to decline in February. Industrial production, employment, income, and retail sales declined again. Unemployment rose to a new post-war peak, and construction activity decreased slightly."

According to "Newsweek" materials, fixed capital investment, which is considered the "most important source of new jobs" in the United States, industrial spending on new factories and equipment is declining sharply, possibly falling to an average of about $30 billion per year by the end of the year, while the investment rate in the summer of last year was nearly $37.05 billion per year on average.

Orders have fallen 14% since August 1956, reaching the lowest level since November 1955.

Currently, more than 25% of the production capacity in US industry is not being used. In some sectors, such as the metallurgical sector, only 50% of the production capacity is being used.

The number of unemployed has reached 5.25 million, an increase of 750,000 in one month from mid-January to mid-February. In March, when the number of unemployed usually decreases, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits surged by another 440,000 in the first week.

Industrial and commercial inventories were still worth $89.3 billion at the end of January this year.

Personal income in February, calculated at an annual rate, fell by $1.8 billion compared to January of this year, and by $5.7 billion compared to the peak in August of last year.

As the economy declines, trade volume also declines. Retail sales in February decreased by 3% compared to January of this year. This is the first time this has happened in this economic recession.

All the optimistic estimates of the US official, saying that things will improve in March, have completely failed. The severe economic recession has forced Eisenhower to successively study ways to deal with the economic recession with congressional Republican leaders, the Secretary of the Treasury, major economic advisors, cabinet members, and governors of various states from March 11th to 17th. However, of all the methods, the most important one at present is still to rely on increasing military orders. According to Defense Secretary McElroy on March 13th, preparations are being made to deal with the economic recession by increasing military orders. In the first half of the year, the Department of Defense will order more than $10 billion in medium-range missiles, aircraft, and other military equipment, while in the second half of 1957, the value of such orders was only $6 billion. With spending increasing and income decreasing, US Budget Director Brundage has resigned because he was unable to balance the budget.

The US economic recession has affected most capitalist countries in the world. Latin American countries have already experienced economic difficulties. According to the Vienna correspondent of the "New York Post," the US economic recession has made Western Europe "smell the signals of a storm." The number of unemployed in various countries has increased, reaching 425,000 in Britain, 1.325 million in West Germany, and 1.86 million in Italy. Japan, India, and Ceylon in the East have also been affected to varying degrees. Many countries are rushing to find a way out. Commonwealth countries are studying ways to deal with the economic recession, and British business people have launched a movement to break the "embargo," demanding the development of trade with socialist countries.

The Indonesian People Hold High the Banner of Anti-Colonialist Struggle

The Indonesian government and people have launched a major struggle against foreign interference and against the rebel groups.

Since the Hussein rebel group established a rebel government in Padang, the United States, through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, has openly encouraged the rebel groups and activities to overthrow the Indonesian government, becoming increasingly rampant. These acts of interference, based in Singapore, involve the dropping and smuggling of weapons. The US Seventh Fleet is conducting exercises near Indonesia, and three warships have been sent to Singapore to threaten Indonesia. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting in Manila from March 11th to 13th and the US-hosted meeting of Asian envoys in Taiwan both planned open or secret interference in Indonesia.

The Indonesian government has taken resolute measures to suppress the rebellion. Since the government troops landed in Central Sumatra on March 10th, with the assistance of the local people, they have made great progress. By March 14th, they had recovered cities and towns such as Wangajili, Shi Daobanzhang, Pekanbaru, and Shuoding-Sri-Indrapura. The entire oil field area in central Central Sumatra has been completely recovered. The government troops also took swift action to defeat the rioting rebels in Medan. This rebellion was organized by Naienggolan, the deputy chief of staff of the First Military Region, who had just returned from training in the United States. The victory of the government troops has boosted the fighting will of the people across the country and has further shaken the internal cohesion of the rebel groups. On March 16th, hundreds of thousands of people in Jakarta and Bandung held rallies and demonstrations, demonstrating the determination of the Indonesian people to oppose imperialism and suppress the rebellion. The conference unanimously demanded that the government implement general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, resolutely repel foreign interference, and expressed support for the Juanda government. President Sukarno delivered a speech to the masses, praising the patriotic actions of the people, exposing the conspiracy of foreign interferers, and calling on all the people and political parties to unite, support the government's struggle, overcome difficulties, defeat the rebellion, and liberate West Irian.

The imperialist conspiracy to subvert the Indonesian government from within has been planned for a long time. Imperialism vainly attempts to restore colonialism in such an important region of Southeast Asia and suppress the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, in order to continue to maintain its collapsing colonial system. Therefore, the struggle of the Indonesian people is not only to defend their hard-won independence and freedom, but also has a significant impact on the anti-colonial struggle in the entire Southeast Asian region. The Chinese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people around the world stand on the side of the Indonesian government and people. The Soviet government and our government have both condemned the criminal acts of the United States and the Southeast Asia aggression bloc in interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Indonesian government and people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and oppose foreign interference and subversion conspiracies. We firmly believe that the Indonesian people will, under the leadership of President Sukarno, overcome difficulties and smash the imperialist conspiracy of interference.

    半月国际述评
    （3月4日到18日）
    近半个月里，国际形势的变化，集中在三个主要方面：第一是在召开最高级会议的问题上，苏联采取了接二连三的步骤，来促其早日召开；美国阻挠会议的借口，已经一个接一个被解除了，于是，就想来一个金蝉脱壳计，甩开高级会议，用裁军问题作由头，拉出联合国裁军委员会和安全理事会，来转移全世界人民的注意。其次，是美国经济衰退，势不可遏，早先美国政府吹嘘的3月份可以好转的说法，已经破灭。美国政府手忙脚乱，人民惊惶不安，并且影响到整个资本主义世界。第三，印度尼西亚人民为反对外国干涉，捍卫已经取得的独立，维护国家的主权和完整，同为虎作伥的叛乱集团展开了坚决的斗争。全世界一切正义的人民，谴责帝国主义卑鄙的阴谋，同情和支持印度尼西亚人民的艰巨斗争。
    在最高级会议问题上两条路线的斗争
    从3月份里发表的重要国际文献里，人们可以看到的有：苏联外交部长在3月1日答复法国外长比诺的信，苏联给美国政府关于召开最高级会议的备忘录，3月3日布尔加宁写给艾森豪威尔的信，3月14日苏联外交部谴责西方国家阻挠最高级会议的声明，3月15日苏联外交部关于禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的、关于撤除各国领土上的外国军事基地和关于研究宇宙空间方面进行国际合作的建议。这些建议归纳起来，有下面几点：
    一、关于最高级会议的准备问题，苏联认为可以通过外交途径，也可以召开外长会议来研究最高级会议的议程、日期、地点和参加国等问题。这样就解除了西方国家坚持召开外长会议为最高级会议作准备进行阻挠的借口。苏联并且具体提出4月召开外长会议，6月召开最高级会议。
    二、关于会议议程问题，苏联重申了为缓和国际紧张局势所迫切需要解决，并且时机已经成熟的问题，如关于禁止使用原子弹和氢弹问题，停止核武器试验问题，各国为了防止突然袭击而采取一些大家同意的措施，在北大西洋公约组织参加国和华沙条约缔约国之间签订互不侵犯协定，双方并根据相互的协议着手裁减外国在德国的驻军，在中欧建立无原子武器地区、停止战争宣传、缓和中近东地区紧张局势的途径，在互利基础上自由发展国际贸易等问题。苏联并且表示了只要大家同意，苏联愿意讨论任何其他参加会议的国家提出的有利于结束冷战的建议（比如对德和约、和平利用宇宙空间）。同时，苏联严正地拒绝了把美国用来干涉东欧社会主义国家内政和德国的问题列入议程。
    三、苏联考虑了艾森豪威尔关于讨论停止利用宇宙空间试验军用火箭、停止生产利用星际空间的武器的建议，为了大大缩小爆发核武器战争的危险，寻求美国、苏联和其他国家的安全，建议应该禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的，同时撤除各国领土上的外国军事基地，并在研究宇宙空间方面进行国际合作。
    这样，苏联就解除了美国拖延会议的一切借口，打开了召开外长会议和最高级会议的通道。苏联的建议，受到全世界舆论的欢迎。可是，美国又出了新花招，企图从根本上来取消最高级会议。杜勒斯在苏联提出新建议之后，就议论说：“看不出任何理由……非举行最高级会议不可”，他认为，“传统的外交办法是一种比较通过政府首脑会议办事要来得更可靠的程序。”与此相呼应，西方国家不顾有关方面正在就召开最高级会议进行磋商，就通过西方报纸，鼓吹召开联合国裁军委员会，并把裁军问题转交安全理事会。这是什么意思呢？
    谁都知道，联合国裁军委员会和小组委员会已经工作了好多年了。这两个委员会的成员，大多数都是西方国家军事集团的参加国，早已成为打着裁军幌子、掩护西方国家进行军备竞赛的组织。因之，在西方国家拒绝扩大裁军委员会的组织之后，苏联在联合国大会第十二届会议上已经声明，不再参加这个委员会的工作。西方国家明知召开这个委员会对于裁军是毫无用处的，为什么硬要在积极准备举行最高级会议的时候，来召开这样的会议呢？无非是为了破坏召开最高级会议而已。因此，当苏联外交部揭穿了西方国家的这个阴谋之后，美国国务院在15日就发表声明，诬蔑苏联没有诚意谋求缓和紧张局势。但是，全世界人民已经不会轻易被西方国家空谈和平所欺骗了。
    在召开高级会议问题上，美国的态度是最顽固的，每当苏联考虑和接受了西方提出的建议，缩小了分歧的时候，美国就又横生枝节，后退一步。美国这种做法不仅遭到全世界舆论日益强烈的谴责，甚至也不能同英法取得完全一致。比如在召开外长会议问题上，法国就同意外长会议只讨论程序问题，而不讨论实质问题。当然，美国仍将继续抵制苏联的合理建议，继续对英法施加压力，尽可能地制造召开最高级会议的障碍。但是，它的地位显然是越来越困难了。
    美国“繁荣”真相戳穿经济风暴波及全国
    美国为什么顽固地破坏最高级会议，害怕国际局势的缓和呢？当经济衰退的风暴已经席卷全国的时候，在3月12日美国劳联—产联的特别大会上，劳联—产联的副主席路德说：“越来越多的工会会员在研究这样一个问题：为什么只有在战争时期美国才能有经济繁荣和全面就业？”广大工会会员的这一个问题，一语道破了美国繁荣的真相。发战争财，军备竞赛，正是美国垄断资本家攫取最高利润的不二法门。可是，美国正在自食其果了。
    美国的经济衰退，越来越严重了。
    工业生产指标，据联邦储备委员会3月17日宣布，2月份已从1月份的一三三点降到一三○点，达到三年多以来的最低点。“2月份经济活动继续衰退。工业生产、就业人数、收入和零售再次下降。失业人数上升到战后的新高峰，建设活动稍有减少。”
    据“新闻周刊”的材料，被认为是美国“新职业的最重要泉源”——固定资本的投资，工业用于新工厂和设备方面的开支，正在剧烈地下降，可能在年底的时候降到平均每年三百亿美元左右，而在去年夏天的投资率将近每年平均三百七十亿零五千万美元。
    定货额从1956年8月以来，下降了14％，达到1955年11月以来的最低水平。
    目前美国工业中有25％以上的生产能力没有利用，在某些部门，比如冶金部门，只利用了50％的生产能力。
    失业人数，已达五百二十五万，在从1月中旬到2月中旬的一个月内增加了七十五万人。在通常情况下，失业人数总是下降的3月份，第一个星期中，申请失业救济的人数又激增四十四万之多。
    工业和商业存货到今年1月底仍然值八百九十三亿美元。
    2月份的个人收入，依年率计算，比今年1月份下降了十八亿美元，而比去年8月份的高峰下降了五十七亿美元。
    随着经济衰退，贸易量也下降了。2月份的零售额比今年1月减少了3％。这是这次经济衰退中第一次出现的现象。
    美国官方一切的乐观估计，说什么3月份将会好转的话，完全落空了。严重的经济衰退，迫使艾森豪威尔在3月11日到17日期间，连续同国会共和党领袖、财政部长、主要经济顾问、内阁成员、各州州长先后研究了对付经济衰退的办法。但是，在所有办法中，目前最主要的还是依靠增加军备订货。据国防部长麦克艾罗伊3月13日表示，准备用增加军备订货办法来对付经济衰退，上半年国防部将在中程导弹、飞机和其他军备费用方面，订货一百亿美元以上，而在1957年下半年这类订货价值只有六十亿美元。在开支增加、收入减少的情况下，美国的预算局长布伦戴奇已经由于无法平衡预算辞职了。
    美国的经济衰退，已经波及世界上大多数资本主义国家。拉丁美洲各国已经发生了经济困难。据“纽约邮报”的维也纳通讯报道，美国的经济衰退已经使西欧“嗅到了暴风雨的信号”。各国失业人数增加，英国已达四十二万五千人，西德一百三十二万五千人，意大利一百八十六万人。东方的日本、印度和锡兰，也都受到了不同程度的影响。许多国家都在急忙寻找出路。英联邦国家正在研究应付经济衰退的办法，英国企业界人士发起打破“禁运”运动，要求发展同社会主义国家的贸易。
    印度尼西亚人民高举反殖民主义斗争的旗帜
    印度尼西亚政府和人民已经展开了反对外国干涉、反对叛乱集团的重大斗争。
    自从侯赛尼叛乱集团在巴东成立叛乱政府以来，美国通过东南亚集团公开助长叛乱集团、推翻印度尼西亚政府的活动，越来越猖狂了。这些干涉活动，以新加坡为基地，空投和偷运武器。美第七舰队在印度尼西亚附近演习，派了三艘军舰到新加坡，进行威胁。3月11日到13日东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议和美国在台湾举行的亚洲各国使节会议，都策划了对印度尼西亚公开的或秘密的干涉。
    印度尼西亚政府，已经采取了坚决的措施，镇压叛乱。从3月10日，政府军队在中苏门答腊登陆以来，在当地人民的协助下，取得了很大的进展。到3月14日，已经光复了望加丽、石叨班让、北干巴鲁、硕顶—斯里—英德拉普拉等城镇，中苏门答腊中部的整个油田区已全部收复。政府军队也以迅速的行动，击溃了在棉兰骚乱的叛乱分子。而这一叛乱活动，是由刚从美国受训回来的第一军区副参谋长奈恩戈兰所组织的。政府军队的胜利，鼓舞了全国人民的斗争意志，也更加动摇了叛乱集团的内部。3月16日，雅加达和万隆几十万群众，举行了大会和示威游行，表现了印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义，镇压叛乱的决心。大会一致要求政府实行总动员来镇压叛乱，全力击退外来干涉，表示支持朱安达政府。苏加诺总统向群众发表了演说，赞扬了人民的爱国行动，揭露了外国干涉者的阴谋，号召全体人民和政党团结一致，支持政府进行斗争，克服困难，击溃叛乱，解放西伊里安。
    帝国主义从内部颠复印度尼西亚政府的阴谋，是策划已久了的。帝国主义妄想在东南亚这样一个重要地区复辟殖民主义，镇压东南亚的民族解放运动，借以继续维护它行将全部瓦解的殖民体系。因之，印度尼西亚人民的斗争，不仅是为的保卫他们已经取得的独立和自由，并且对于东南亚整个地区反殖民主义斗争有重大的影响。中国人民，亚洲人民以及全世界一切爱好和平和自由的人民，都是站在印度尼西亚政府和人民一边。苏联政府和我国政府都先后谴责了美国和东南亚侵略集团干涉印度尼西亚内政的罪恶行为，并且坚决支持印度尼西亚政府和人民为维护国家独立和主权、反对外来干涉和颠复阴谋的正义斗争。我们深信，印度尼西亚人民，必将在苏加诺总统领导下，战胜困难，粉碎帝国主义的干涉阴谋。
