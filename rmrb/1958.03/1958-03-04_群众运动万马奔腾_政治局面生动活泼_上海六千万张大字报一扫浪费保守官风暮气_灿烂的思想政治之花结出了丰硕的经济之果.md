Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd: Shanghai's anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement has entered its peak in the few short days after the Spring Festival. Over 60 million big-character posters have been put up in factories, government offices, shops, and schools throughout the city. Various units have also held thousands of exhibitions comparing advanced practices and opposing waste. This surging revolutionary tide, for the sake of socialism and for more, faster, better, and more economical results, is sweeping away ideological, political, and economic conservatism, backwardness, and waste with unstoppable force, wiping out all bureaucratism, stagnation, and unhealthy tendencies. In this movement, many outdated regulations that hindered the enthusiasm of the masses have been broken through, some major problems that had not been resolved for a long time have been solved smoothly, some things that were previously considered impossible are now being done quickly, and people's production, work, study, and life are showing a vigorous and vibrant scene everywhere.

During the Spring Festival, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all Communist Party members and cadres at all levels to quickly improve their leadership style and working methods, stand at the forefront of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, and promote the development of the movement. Encouraged by the new situation of "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind" and "catching up with Britain in fifteen years," after ten months of the Rectification Movement, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was truly "an arrow on the string, ready to be released." Factories first launched a high tide of extensive airing of views and debates, launching a fierce attack on waste and conservatism, and government offices, schools, and shops immediately followed suit. Leaders at all levels used methods such as grasping both ends to compare advanced practices, mobilizing mutual visits, convening on-site meetings, and taking the lead in posting big-character posters to accelerate the development of the movement. The momentum of the movement, the speed of progress, and the depth and breadth of its scope are unprecedented in previous movements.

Among the tens of millions of big-character posters, the spearhead is first directed at all waste phenomena that violate the principles of building the country with diligence and thrift and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results, forming a nationwide production and work general inspection. Among the 130,000 big-character posters in the No. 1 State Cotton Factory, nearly 80% are criticisms of waste and backward phenomena in production. From the spoilage and backlog of batches of materials to the waste of a needle and a thread, an inch of yarn, or a degree of electricity, everything has been searched out one by one. The big-character posters also exposed various intangible wastes: the factory's production potential has not been fully utilized, the teaching quality in schools is not high, the individualism and conservatism in scientific research work, the backlog of funds in commercial departments, the inefficiency in government office work, and other backward phenomena such as following the old ways, stagnation, and lack of drive have all been criticized and condemned by the masses. The 400,000 big-character posters of teachers and students of Jiaotong University focused their firepower on attacking the arrogance and complacency in the school leadership and teaching work. The big-character posters said: "Jiaoda" is also known as "Jiao Da" (meaning "Arrogant University"). For many years, the teachers and students of Jiaotong University have always regarded themselves as "the best in the South." This arrogant and complacent thinking has not only caused backwardness in teaching and scientific research work, resulting in huge economic losses, but more seriously, has had a very bad influence on the students' thinking, making them both "arrogant" and "spoiled." Now, all the teachers and students of the school are working hard to overcome arrogance and change backwardness.

This unprecedented revolutionary struggle is an extremely profound self-education movement for the masses. While criticizing the unhealthy tendencies and conservatism and backwardness of the leadership, the masses more consciously and universally carried out criticism and self-criticism, creating an unprecedented democratic movement in the city. The chief process engineer of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory used to find problems in a design by a design engineer that would cause waste, but was reluctant to bring it up for the sake of face. This time, the chief process engineer criticized the design engineer and also examined himself. The technical personnel of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory took the initiative to go to the workshop to solicit opinions from the workers. The trend of criticism and self-criticism has also blown into many "century-old shops." Many old shop assistants who had never criticized others face-to-face also picked up their pens and wrote out various opinions that had been accumulated for a long time.

In the context of an unprecedentedly active democratic atmosphere, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is developing more and more in depth. When a department exposes waste, it often involves the upper and lower levels, so they send big-character posters to each other, expose each other, guarantee each other, and compete with each other. The relationship between people has also undergone profound changes, and a new atmosphere of mutual criticism, mutual encouragement, unity and friendship has emerged: the relationship between leaders and those led is closer; the engineering and technical personnel and workers in the factory are closer; the researchers of scientific research institutions and the professors of universities have changed their previous situation of non-cooperation or little cooperation, and have successively formulated methods to strengthen cooperation; literary and art workers have also begun to make friends with workers and farmers. Now, a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and with individual ease of mind and liveliness, has begun to emerge in various departments in Shanghai.

Brilliant flowers of ideology and politics will inevitably bear abundant economic fruit. On Shanghai's production front, good news is constantly being reported. After breaking through conservative thinking, the potential of industrial production has been greatly released. Originally, the planned total industrial output value for 1958 was to increase by 14% compared to the actual completion last year, but now it has been raised to 35%. After breaking through the rules, the employees of the Shanghai Railway Administration shortened the travel time of the direct passenger train from Shanghai to Nanjing from the original five hours and two minutes to three hours, fifty-two and a half minutes. These heroic deeds are constantly emerging. Cultural and educational workers, sports workers, and the business community are also making great leaps forward. At present, the city's pilot units have begun to rely on the masses for major rectification and major reforms. The slogan put forward by the masses is: Ten thousand opinions, deal with them in batches, everyone starts, reform thoroughly. A city-wide up-and-down major rectification and reform climax that is both good and thorough is about to arrive. (Attached pictures)

    群众运动万马奔腾
    政治局面生动活泼
    上海六千万张大字报一扫浪费保守官风暮气
    灿烂的思想政治之花结出了丰硕的经济之果
    据新华社上海3日电　上海的反浪费反保守运动在春节后短短几天内进入了高峰。全市工厂、机关、商店、学校贴出的大字报已超过六千万张，各单位还举行了数以千计的比先进反浪费展览会。这一气势澎湃的一切为了社会主义、一切为了多、快、好、省的革命巨浪，正以锐不可当的气势冲刷着思想上、政治上、经济上的保守、落后和浪费现象，横扫着一切官气、暮气和邪气。在这个运动中，许多束缚群众积极性的陈旧规章纷纷被突破，一些长期得不到解决的重大问题顺利地得到了解决，一些过去认为办不到的事情现在很快办到了，人们的生产、工作、学习和生活，处处呈现着朝气蓬勃的景象。
    春节期间，中共上海市委员会号召全市共产党员和各级干部迅速改进领导作风和工作方法，站到反浪费反保守运动的前面去，促进运动的发展。在“东风压倒西风”、“十五年赶上英国”的新形势鼓舞下，经过十个月的整风运动，群众的革命激情到此真是“箭在弦上，一触即发”。各工厂首先掀起了大鸣大放的高潮，向浪费保守现象展开猛烈围攻，机关、学校和商店立即跟上。各级领导运用抓两头比先进、发动相互参观、召开现场会议和带头贴大字报等方法，加速了运动的发展。运动来势之猛，进展之速，涉及范围的深和广，都为历次运动所未有。
    在数以千万计的大字报中，锋芒首先指向一切违反勤俭建国和多快好省方针的浪费现象，形成了一个全民性的生产和工作大检查。国棉一厂十三万多张大字报中，近80％是对生产上浪费和落后现象的批评。从成批物资的霉烂和积压到一针一线、一寸纱一度电的浪费，都一一被搜索出来。大字报还揭发出各种无形的浪费：工厂的生产潜力没有得到发挥、学校里教学质量不高、科学研究工作中的单干和保守现象、商业部门的积压资金、机关工作中的效率不高，以及其他各种因循守旧、暮气沉沉、干劲不足等落后现象，都受到了广大群众的批评与指责。交通大学师生的四十万张大字报，集中火力猛攻学校领导和教学工作中的骄傲自大思想，大字报说：“交大”又名“骄大”，多少年来，交大师生一直以“南方第一”自居，这种骄傲自大的思想不仅造成教学和科学研究工作中的落后状态，造成了经济上的巨大损失，更严重的是对学生的思想产生了极坏的影响，使他们又“骄”又“娇”。现在全校师生正鼓足干劲，为克服骄气、改变落后而斗争。
    这个规模空前的革命斗争，对广大群众是一个无比深刻的自我教育运动。群众在批评领导上的歪风邪气和保守落后的同时，更自觉地普遍开展了批评与自我批评，造成了全市空前规模的民主运动。上海机床厂的总工艺师过去发现设计工程师在某项设计中有毛病，会造成浪费，但限于情面，不愿意提出来。这次总工艺师批评了设计工程师，同时也检查了自己。上海电机厂的技术人员，主动下车间向工人征求意见。批评与自我批评之风还吹进了不少“百年老店”，好些从来不曾当面批评过别的老店员，这次也拿起笔杆，写出积蓄已久的种种意见。
    在民主空气空前活跃的情况下，反浪费反保守运动越来越向纵深发展，一个部门揭发了浪费，常常会牵连到上下左右，于是互相送大字报，互相揭发，互相保证，互相竞赛。人与人的关系也发生了深刻的变化，出现了相互批评、相互鼓励、团结友爱的新气象：领导与被领导的关系更为密切了；工厂中的工程技术人员与工人更加接近了；科学研究机构的研究人员和高等学校的教授，改变了以往互不合作或很少合作的情况，纷纷订立加强协作的办法；文艺工作者也开始与工人农民交上朋友。现在，一个既有集中又有民主，既有纪律又有自由，既有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面，已在上海各个部门开始出现。
    灿烂的思想政治之花，必然结出丰硕的经济之果。上海的生产战线上，不断传出捷报。工业生产在突破了保守思想以后潜力大大发挥。本来，1958年的工业生产总值计划比去年实际完成数增加14％，现在提高到35％。上海铁路管理局职工冲破常规以后，使上海到南京直达客车的行车时间，从原来的五小时零二分缩短到三小时五十二分半。这些英雄豪迈的事迹正在不断涌现。文化教育工作者、体育工作者、工商界也都在大跃进中。目前，全市先行单位已经开始依靠群众大整大改。广大群众提出的口号是：成万意见，成批处理，大家动手，改得彻底。一个全市规模的上下动手改得又好又透的大整大改的高潮即将到来。（附图片）
