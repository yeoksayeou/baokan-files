Comrades and Representatives,

　　The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, after more than a year of preparation, consultation, and planning, has now been established. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, I extend my warm congratulations to all the representatives, the Zhuang people, and the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi.

　　The Zhuang ethnic group has a long history, culture, and a glorious revolutionary tradition, making significant contributions to the revolution of the motherland. They have resided in Guangxi for a long time; therefore, it is entirely necessary to establish an autonomous region at the provincial level for the Zhuang people.

　　The Zhuang people are one of the more populous, politically, economically, and culturally developed ethnic minorities in our country. They have a long history, culture, and a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Zhuang people have lived in Guangxi since ancient times and are scattered in other areas of Lingnan. In the process of developing this rich and beautiful land of Lingnan, the Zhuang people have made indelible historical contributions. In the common revolutionary cause of all ethnic groups in the motherland, the Zhuang people have made important contributions. However, in the past, the reactionary ruling class never recognized the Zhuang people as a distinct ethnic group and adopted policies of discrimination and oppression against them. In order to resist the class and ethnic oppression imposed on them, the Zhuang people enthusiastically participated in and supported the various revolutionary movements in China. As everyone knows, the famous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution in Chinese history originated in Guangxi; among the prominent leaders who led this revolutionary movement were Zhuang people. In the past three decades, the heroic deeds of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi in the revolutionary movement under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the struggle against the feudal warlords and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, are also well known. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, a vigorous peasant movement emerged in the Youjiang area of Guangxi; among the leading comrades of this movement was Comrade Wei Baqun, a loyal son of the Zhuang people and an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, revolutionary Soviet regimes were established in the Zuojiang and Youjiang areas of Guangxi, and the Red Seventh and Red Eighth Armies were also established. These armies later became part of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, fighting across the country and making brilliant contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. Some of the cadres who participated in local work continued to persist in underground struggles and guerrilla warfare for a long time under the leadership of the Party, powerfully coordinating with the liberation of the whole country and Guangxi. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups abolished the system of ethnic oppression, realized ethnic equality, and after achieving victory in the land reform, basically realized the socialist revolution. Socialist construction has developed, and people's lives have improved. All of this shows that the ethnic relations and the face of all ethnic groups have undergone fundamental changes in the few years since liberation. It should be particularly pointed out that through long-term revolutionary struggles, the Party has cultivated a group of long-tested communist cadres among the Zhuang people. It is very clear that, in accordance with the Party and the state's policy of ethnic equality and regional ethnic autonomy, it is entirely necessary to establish an autonomous region at the provincial level for the Zhuang people.

　　Adopting a method of cooperation between the Zhuang, Han, and other ethnic groups to transform Guangxi Province into the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is in line with the interests of all ethnic groups in Guangxi and with the Party and the state's ethnic policies.

　　Guangxi is a place where the Zhuang people live in concentrated communities, and it is also a multi-ethnic region. The fraternal ethnic groups living in Guangxi also include the Yao, Miao, Dong, Hui, Mulao, Maonan, and Lolo ethnic groups, who have a long history and have formed an inseparable relationship with the Zhuang people. The Han people in Guangxi are also a more populous ethnic group with significant political influence. This is an important characteristic of Guangxi, and this characteristic must be constantly noted when dealing with ethnic issues in Guangxi. Because the people of the Zhuang, Han, and other ethnic groups in Guangxi have lived together for a long time, jointly developed the land of Guangxi, and jointly carried out revolutionary struggles, they have formed close economic and cultural ties and a brotherly friendship. Therefore, adopting a method of cooperation between the Zhuang, Han, and other ethnic groups instead of separating them to transform the original Guangxi Province into the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is entirely appropriate. This is in line with the historical development trend of Guangxi, in line with the actual situation of ethnic relations, and in line with the long-term interests and requirements of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, and therefore also in line with the principles of the Party and the state's policy of regional ethnic autonomy.

　　The establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region will fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the Zhuang people to build socialism and strengthen the unity of the motherland and ethnic solidarity.

　　In recent years, the Party and the state have established more than eighty autonomous regions for more than thirty ethnic groups, and more than 90% of the ethnic minority population living in concentrated communities has implemented regional autonomy.

　　In the past, the Zhuang people in Guangxi also established autonomous prefectures in some areas and achieved great success, accumulating valuable experience for the establishment of the autonomous region and cultivating a large number of Zhuang cadres. Experience in various places has proven that the policy of regional ethnic autonomy is indeed the basic policy for solving ethnic problems in our country. It can guarantee that the ethnic groups implementing regional autonomy realize the right to manage their own internal affairs, thereby fully mobilizing their enthusiasm and initiative to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, which is conducive to strengthening the unity of the motherland and ethnic solidarity. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is another major achievement of the Party and the state in promoting the policy of regional ethnic autonomy, a great happy event in the history of the Zhuang people, and also a common happy event for all ethnic groups in the country.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have been carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction at a rapid pace since they realized the revolutionary tasks of overthrowing imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism. After basically achieving victory in socialist ownership in 1956, we launched a nationwide rectification movement and a struggle against bourgeois rightists in 1957, and we also achieved basic victories on the political and ideological fronts. In this year, we overfulfilled the first five-year plan for socialist construction in our country. Due to the great victory of the socialist revolution and construction, the smooth progress of the rectification movement, and even more so because the Party Central Committee proposed to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, revised and promulgated the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, and once again emphasized adhering to the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This has greatly inspired the revolutionary zeal of the people across the country. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in our country are in an unprecedentedly favorable situation for a comprehensive great leap forward in the national economy, and a new upsurge in production has emerged. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at this time is of even greater significance. We can foresee that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in such a favorable situation will, through its own efforts, achieve great development and a great leap forward in socialist economic and cultural construction in a short period of time.

　　The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi should share the same boat through storms and waves, strive to change the face of the autonomous region in the shortest possible time, and further improve the lives of the people of all ethnic groups.

　　What are the tasks of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi after the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region? Our task is to further consolidate and strengthen the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, and on the basis of continuing to complete the rectification movement and opposing bourgeois rightists, mobilize the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi with unparalleled enthusiasm to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Everyone should "stir up their energy and strive for the top," and comrades, units, the autonomous region, and neighboring provinces should all "compete with the advanced and learn from the advanced"; resolutely implement the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; under the slogan of "hard work for three years," strive to complete the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program in the autonomous region ahead of schedule, and strive to enable the output value of local industry in the autonomous region to catch up with the output value of agriculture in a short period of time, and strive to change the face of the autonomous region in the shortest possible time, and further improve the material and cultural life of the people.

　　The work of the original Guangxi Province has been very successful, creating good conditions for the construction of the autonomous region. We should make full use of the various favorable conditions in Guangxi, give full play to the revolutionary tradition of long-term unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in Guangxi in the difficult revolutionary process, and continue to cultivate a large number of cadres of all ethnic groups who are both red and expert, to jointly build the autonomous region. Chairman Mao once instructed us that "the unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause." After the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, only if the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Zhuang and Han people, unite more closely, "share the same boat through storms and waves," can the industry, agriculture, and other economic and cultural undertakings of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region achieve a comprehensive leap forward. It should be seen that with the continuous development of socialist economy and culture, the cooperative and mutually beneficial relations between all ethnic groups will achieve a high degree of development.

　　In order to ensure that the great leap forward in production can be realized, there must be a great leap forward in thinking. This requires earnestly grasping the rectification movement, overcoming all shortcomings and errors in our work, opposing waste, opposing conservatism, eliminating bureaucratic and lethargic attitudes, earnestly improving work methods, advocating the spirit of hard work, and implementing the Party's mass line.

　　Resolutely opposing bourgeois nationalism, focusing on opposing local nationalism in ethnic minority areas, is an important task at present.

　　In the rectification movement, we must also resolutely oppose bourgeois nationalism, which is an important task for the revolutionary cadres, Communist Party members, and people of all ethnic groups in our country. Han chauvinism and local nationalism are both reflections of bourgeois ideology on ethnic issues, and both must be opposed. According to the national situation, we should focus on opposing local nationalism in ethnic minority areas at present. Because local nationalism has become a dangerous tendency worthy of serious attention in many ethnic minorities, if it is not opposed, it will undermine the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups, and it will hinder the development of the socialist cause.

　　Comrades and Representatives, I firmly believe that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will certainly play a great inspirational role for the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. The Zhuang people and the Han and other ethnic groups in Guangxi will certainly recognize their responsibilities, will certainly further unite, and will contribute their greatest strength to the construction of the autonomous region and to the common socialist construction cause of the people of all ethnic groups in the great motherland.

### 各族人民要风雨同舟乘风破浪  争取最短期间改变自治区面貌  贺龙副总理在广西僮族自治区第一届人代会第一次会议上的讲话

    各族人民要风雨同舟乘风破浪
    争取最短期间改变自治区面貌
    贺龙副总理在广西僮族自治区第一届人代会第一次会议上的讲话各位代表、各位同志：
      广西僮族自治区经过一年多的酝酿、协商和筹备，现在已经宣告成立了。我谨代表中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席向各位代表、僮族人民和广西各族人民致热烈的祝贺。
    僮族有悠久的历史文化和光荣的革命传统，在祖国革命中又有重要贡献，并且很早就在广西聚居，因此，为僮族建立一个省一级的自治地方完全必要
    僮族，是我国少数民族中人口比较多，政治、经济、文化也比较发展的一个民族。它有着悠久的历史文化和光荣的革命传统。僮族人民很早以来就聚居在广西，并且散居在岭南其他地区。在开发岭南这块富饶优美的国土过程中，有僮族人民不可磨灭的历史功绩；在祖国各族人民共同的革命事业中，有僮族人民的重要贡献。但是，过去反动统治阶级一直不承认僮族是一个民族，并且对僮族采取歧视和压迫的政策。僮族人民为了反抗加在他们身上的阶级压迫和民族压迫，踊跃地参加和支持了中国历次的革命运动。大家知道，我国历史上有名的太平天国革命运动，它的策源地就在广西；在领导这个革命运动的著名领袖中就有僮族。近三十多年来，广西各族人民在中国共产党领导下的革命运动中，在反对封建军阀、蒋介石反动集团的斗争中所作出的英雄事迹，也是尽人皆知的。当第一次国内革命战争时期，广西右江一带就出现过轰轰烈烈的农民运动；这个运动的领导同志中就有僮族人民的忠诚子弟、中国共产党的优秀党员韦拔群同志。在第二次国内革命战争时期，广西的左、右江一带，曾经建立过革命的苏维埃政权，同时还建立了红七军和红八军。这些军队，后来成为中国人民解放军的一部分，转战祖国各地，为中国人民解放事业立下了光辉的功勋；当时参加地方工作的一部分干部，继续在党的领导下长期坚持了地下斗争和游击战争，有力地配合了全国和广西的解放。解放后，各族人民又废除了民族压迫制度，实现了民族平等，各民族人民在取得了土地改革的胜利以后又基本上实现了社会主义革命，社会主义建设有了发展，人民生活有了改善。所有这些都说明解放几年来民族关系和各民族的面貌已经发生了根本性的变化。应该特别指出的是，经过长期的革命斗争，党在僮族中培养了一批久经锻炼的共产主义干部。十分明显，依照党和国家的民族平等政策和民族区域自治政策，为僮族建立一个省一级的自治地方是完全必要的。
      采用僮汉和其他民族合作的办法，把广西省改建为广西僮族自治区是既符合广西各族人民的利益，又符合党和国家的民族政策的
    广西是僮族聚居的地方，同时又是一个多民族的地方。聚居在广西的兄弟民族，还有瑶、苗、侗、回、仫佬、毛难、倮倮等民族，他们都有悠久的历史，同僮族人民一道，互相结成了血肉不可分离的关系。汉族在广西，更是一个人口较多、政治影响较大的民族。这是广西的一个重要特点，对待广西的民族问题，必须经常注意到这个特点。由于广西的僮族、汉族和其他民族的人民，长期生活在一起，共同开发了广西的土地，共同进行革命斗争，已经结成了亲密的经济和文化联系，和亲如兄弟的友爱关系，所以采用僮汉和其他民族合作的办法而不采用分开的办法，把原来的广西省改建为广西僮族自治区，是完全适当的。这样做，既符合广西的历史发展趋向、符合民族关系的实际情况，又符合广西各族人民的长远的利益和要求，因而也符合党和国家的民族区域自治政策的原则。
      僮族自治区的成立将充分发挥僮族人民的建设社会主义的积极性，加强祖国的统一和民族的团结
    几年来，党和国家已经为三十多个民族分别建立了八十多个自治地方，有90％以上聚居的少数民族人口实行了区域自治。
    广西的僮族过去也曾经在一部分地区建立了自治州，获得了很大的成就，为建立自治区积累了宝贵的经验，培养了大量的僮族干部。各地的经验都证明：民族的区域自治政策，确实是解决我国民族问题的基本政策。它能够保障实行区域自治的民族，在管理本民族内部事务上实现当家作主的权利，从而能够充分发挥他们参加祖国社会主义建设的积极性和主动精神，有利于加强祖国的统一和民族团结。毫无疑问，广西僮族自治区的成立，是党和国家推行民族区域自治政策的又一重大成就，是僮族人民历史上一件大喜事，同时也是全国各族人民共同的大喜事。
    我国各族人民在中国共产党的领导下，自从实现了打倒帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义的革命任务以来，以便很快的速度进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设。在1956年基本上取得了社会主义所有制方面的胜利之后，接着在1957年发动了全民性的整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，又在政治战线和思想战线方面取得了基本的胜利。就在这一年超额地完成了我国社会主义建设的第一个五年计划。由于社会主义革命和建设事业的伟大胜利，由于整风运动的顺利进展，更由于党中央提出了在十五年或者更多一点的时间内在钢铁及其他主要工业生产品方面赶上或者超过英国，修正公布了农业发展纲要草案，以及又一次强调坚持又多又快又好又省的勤俭建国方针。这样，就大大鼓起了全国人民的革命干劲。现在，我国各族人民正处在国民经济全面大跃进的空前有利形势下，一个新的生产高潮已经出现，在这个时期成立广西僮族自治区更有重大的意义。我们可以预料广西僮族自治区在这样的有利形势下成立，必将经过自己的努力，在短期内获得社会主义经济、文化建设的大发展和大跃进。
    广西各族人民应该风雨同舟，乘风破浪，争取在最短期间改变自治区的面貌，更加改善各族人民的生活
    广西僮族自治区在成立以后，广西各族人民的任务是什么呢？我们的任务就是更进一步巩固和加强各民族的团结合作，在继续完成整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的基础上，动员广西各族人民以无比的热情，积极地参加祖国的社会主义建设。人人都应该“鼓起干劲，力争上游”，同志之间、单位之间、自治区和邻省之间，都应该“比先进、学先进”；坚决实现多、快、好、省的勤俭建国方针；在“苦干三年”的口号下，为在自治区提前完成农业发展纲要草案、为自治区的地方工业产值能够在不长的时间内赶上农业的产值而努力奋斗，争取在最短期间改变自治区的面貌，并且更加改善人民的物质文化生活。
    原来广西省的工作是有很大成绩的，它为自治区的建设创造了良好的条件。应当充分利用广西各种有利条件，发挥广西各族人民在艰难的革命过程中长期团结合作的革命传统，并且继续培养大量又红又专的各民族的干部，共同来建设自治区。毛主席曾经指示我们说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证”。在广西僮族自治区成立以后，只有各族人民特别是僮族和汉族人民更紧密地团结起来，“风雨同舟，乘风破浪”，才能使广西僮族自治区的工业、农业和其他经济文化事业得到全面的跃进。应该看到：随着社会主义经济文化的不断发展，各民族间的合作互助关系将获得高度的发展。
    为了保证生产上的大跃进能够实现，就必须有一个思想上的大跃进。这就要认真地抓紧整风运动，克服我们工作中一切缺点和错误，反对浪费、反对保守，打掉官气暮气，切实改进工作方法，提倡苦干精神，贯彻党的群众路线。
      坚决反对资产阶级民族主义，在少数民族地区着重反对地方民族主义，是当前的一项重要任务
    在整风运动中，还必须坚决地反对资产阶级民族主义，这是我国各民族的革命干部、共产党员和人民的一项重要任务。大汉族主义和地方民族主义都是资产阶级思想在民族问题上的反映，都必须加以反对。根据全国的情况，在少数民族地区当前应当着重地反对地方民族主义。因为地方民族主义已经在许多少数民族中成了一种值得严重注意的危险倾向，如果不加反对，就会破坏祖国统一和各民族间的团结，就会妨碍社会主义事业的发展。
    各位代表、各位同志，我坚决的相信，广西僮族自治区的成立，对广西各族人民一定会发挥伟大的鼓舞作用。僮族人民和广西的汉族以及其他民族人民一定会认清自己的责任，一定会更进一步团结起来，对自治区的建设、对伟大祖国各民族人民共同的社会主义建设事业，贡献出最大的力量。
