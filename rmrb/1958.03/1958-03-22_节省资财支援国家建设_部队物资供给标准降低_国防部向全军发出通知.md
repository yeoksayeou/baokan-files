Xinhua News Agency, March 21st – The Ministry of National Defense recently issued a notice to the entire army, lowering and revising the material supply standards for troops. The implementation of the new standards can save a large amount of resources to support national construction. Lowering just a few major supply standards alone can save more than 30 million yuan annually.

According to the new standards, the daily grain consumption quota for personnel on the supply system in the People's Liberation Army will be reduced by one tael per person, and the coal consumption for cooking will be reduced by 6.5 liang. The original regulation stipulated that officers at all levels would receive two sets of single-layer uniforms per year, but now it has been changed to one set. The scope of distribution for work clothes in the troops will also be appropriately reduced, changing from individual distribution to communal use, and some old items will be distributed. The towels issued to soldiers will be changed from the original standard of three per person per year to two. The subsidy shoes for construction troops personnel will be changed from an average of three to four pairs per person per year to two pairs, and it is stipulated that each construction troop shall manage them uniformly and distribute them at its discretion. The new standards stipulate the cancellation of the half-catty supplementary feed for mules and horses in the troops, the cancellation of the meal expenses for the opening and graduation ceremonies of military academies, and the appropriate reduction of the living standards of students in military nursing schools. In addition, the new standards also stipulate the charging methods for out-patient and in-patient medical treatment in the army for non-established employees, family members, and nannies, as well as the charging methods for troops personnel using public vehicles for private matters.

These new supply standards will be implemented from April 1, 1958.

Prior to this, the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, based on the reasonable opinions put forward by the majority of officers and soldiers during the rectification movement, and with the approval of the Ministry of National Defense and the State Council, revised some military supply standards. For example, the multi-child subsidy for officers was cancelled, and the summer uniforms for general, colonel, and lieutenant-level officers, which were originally made of wool serge, tussah silk, and twill fabric respectively, were all changed to plain cloth.

    节省资财支援国家建设
    部队物资供给标准降低
    国防部向全军发出通知
    新华社21日讯　国防部最近向全军发出通知，降低和改订部队各项物资供给标准。新标准的实施，可以节省大批资财支援国家建设，其中仅几项主要供给标准的降低，每年就可以节约三千万元以上。
    按照新标准，解放军部队中的供给制人员，每人每天的粮食消费定量比原标准减少一两，炊事用煤减少六两五钱。各级军官的单军服原规定年发两套，现改发一套。部队中工作服的发放范围也适当缩小，由发给个人改为公用，并且改发一部分旧品。发给士兵的毛巾，由原标准每人每年三条改为两条。施工部队人员的补助鞋，由原来平均每人每年三到四双改为两双，并规定由各施工部队统一掌管，酌情发放。新标准规定取消部队骡马的每日半斤补助料，取消军事院校开学、毕业时的会餐费，适当降低军队护士学校学员的生活待遇。此外，新标准还规定了编制以外的职工、家属、保姆在军队中门诊住院医疗收费办法，部队人员因私事使用公用汽车的收费办法等。
    这些新的供给标准，将从1958年4月1日起开始实行。
    在这以前，解放军总后勤部根据部队广大官兵在整风运动中提出的合理意见，报经国防部和国务院批准，修订了一些军需供给标准。如取消军官多子女补助费，将原来分别用毛哔叽、柞蚕丝和斜纹布制作的将、校、尉级军官的夏常服一律改用平布等。
