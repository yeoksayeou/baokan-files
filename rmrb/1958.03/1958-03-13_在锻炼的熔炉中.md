    In the Furnace of Training
    Editor's Note: The cadres from the Ministry of Public Security who were sent to the rural areas of Hebei for labor training wrote many letters to their colleagues in their original work units shortly after being sent down, reporting their initial experiences and gains in labor training. Here, we publish excerpts from four of them.
    Initial Passage Through the "Three Barriers" Comrade ××:
    I've been here for five days already. Although the time has been short, everything I've encountered has been a test and training for me.
    First, let's talk about eating. As soon as we arrived, the landlord warmly welcomed us with corn cakes. When I chewed on the corn cake, it made a rustling sound, and it was really hard to swallow. When I was about to spit it out, I thought: Whether I can eat with the peasants depends on today. This is a test, and a member of the Communist Youth League should be able to withstand it. Suddenly, I felt a surge of strength and swallowed it in one gulp. At that time, my landlord said, "Old Qian can eat it!" For the past four or five days, we've been mainly eating corn cakes, cornbread, and sorghum, vegetable, and sweet potato porridge made from coarse grains and bran. I admit that there were many difficulties in eating with the peasants, and there were many ideological struggles, but now I can confidently tell you: I can persevere!
    The second problem I encountered was sleeping. My landlord and I, a total of five people, all sleep on one kang (heated brick bed). The kang is small and crowded, and the old folks don't have good hygiene habits, so the smell is also very unpleasant. I couldn't sleep well the first night, but by the second day, because I had worked all day, I fell asleep as soon as I lay down, and didn't care about the crowding or the smell. I've been sleeping pretty well these past few days, and I think once I get used to it, it won't be a problem.
    The third problem is labor. The second day we arrived here, we went to the fields with the old folks to work. The first day was pulling the roller, and at first it felt easy, but after a day, I had two big blisters on my hands, and my back ached and my legs hurt so much that I could hardly get out of bed. Through these few days of labor, I have deeply realized that labor is indeed a great and arduous thing. Only by honestly learning and diligently working hard can we obtain fruitful results from labor.
    Comrades, although we have initially passed the "three barriers," there are still many difficulties waiting for us. We have the confidence to meet all difficulties, overcome all difficulties, and never let our comrades down!

    To Train Earnestly Comrade ××:
    I joined the labor force the second day I arrived here. Currently, the main tasks are chopping grass and accumulating manure, and occasionally doing some housework.
    In the past ten days, I haven't learned many skills, but I've made a lot of jokes. The first afternoon, I was shoveling soil to pad the pigsty. I didn't do much work, but I got three big blisters on my hands. This news quickly spread throughout the village. Once, I used a large broom to sweep up weeds to accumulate manure. No matter how I held the broom, it didn't look right, and it wasn't effective to hold it with both hands. The old folks laughed when they saw it, and I later learned how to correct it. I have learned to carry water. Here, water is drawn from a well, using a shoulder pole to hook the buckets and lower them into the well. I dropped the buckets into the well several times, and I was very anxious and didn't know what to do. It was only with the help of the old folks that I slowly learned. I chopped grass for a day, but I didn't learn it well. When using the chaff cutter, I only used the strength of my arms, and didn't know how to use the pressure of bending over, so I was tired and didn't chop the grass well.
    Not only am I completely ignorant of production, but I also don't recognize the names of many grains and farm tools. For example, millet, buckwheat, black beans, and turnips, I had never seen before. I couldn't even name the halter, wooden collar, and other things used for livestock. The day I chopped grass, the mouth of the chaff cutter was blocked by broken grass. The old folks asked me to go to the yard to get a sesame stalk to clear the mouth of the chaff cutter. I searched in the yard for a long time, but couldn't find a sesame stalk. I had no choice but to take a small wooden stick back. The old folks laughed when they saw it. Later, I learned that there were piles of sesame stalks in the yard!
    Because I know nothing about rural things and have not undergone basic labor production training, only knowing how to eat, wear, and use, but not understanding how these things come about, once I am put into production, I will inevitably be like a "blockhead," knowing nothing. I didn't let this affect my mood, but it gave me an extra boost of strength, prompting me to train and learn earnestly.

    Ignorance Leads to Jokes Comrade ××:
    After going to the countryside, we plunged into intense production labor. Currently, I have already taken two major lessons: pushing waterwheels to irrigate wheat and accumulating manure. After these days of labor, I first felt that farm work is indeed not as simple as imagined. For example, the ox cart, it looks like nothing, but if you ask carefully, there are quite a few tricks to it. What? Autumn rope, what is a waist strap, a carriage? I really can't remember it all at once. Hitching an ox cart is a skill, where to put those parts, if you put them in the wrong place, the cart won't move. Talking about driving an ox cart is even more difficult. There are slogans for making the ox turn corners, and if the slogan is not right, the ox will not move. I have driven the ox cart with the whip holder (the old farmer who drives the cart) a few times. Once, he asked me to try it. I should have shouted "yo" to turn outward, but I remembered it wrong and shouted "yo li," and as a result, the ox turned inward, making me at a loss, and the old farmer who was holding the whip corrected it.
    Comrades Gao Zhengde and Liu Yuhe also made jokes. Once, the two of them were assigned to watch the ox pulling the waterwheel, and they wanted the ox to stop, but they didn't know how to shout, so they shouted loudly, "Stand! Stand!" How could the ox understand! It kept walking. They had no choice but to turn around with the ox. One day, we all got together and talked about it. When we talked about this, Comrade Xiao Feng joked with Gao and Liu, saying, "Why don't you shout: Ox, pause." Then someone else joked, "You can make a basketball court pause gesture," which caused a burst of laughter.
    That's about driving the cart. Talking about unloading the cart, there were also many jokes. I heard that a comrade from the Ministry of Public Security even unloaded the ox nose ring when unloading the cart once, which almost caused trouble. This was a huge joke to the old folks, so this joke spread from their village to our village, and everyone who heard it laughed.
    There are more jokes, I remember the most prominent ones are these two things that happened to the ox. These jokes are not surprising to us, because we have never done it and know nothing about it. But on the other hand, it also shows that farm work is indeed not simple, and our knowledge of production is simply a blank sheet of paper. I deeply feel that only by humbly and diligently learning from the old folks can we gain something.

    Vivid Class Education Comrade ××:
    On the 6th, our village held a conference to struggle against the illegal landlords, which was a profound and vivid class education. This struggle meeting tells us that the landlord class and counter-revolutionaries are "die-hards."
    That day, many old folks exposed the counterattacks of illegal landlords. Among them, the biggest landlord, Liu Shengguan, was the most rampant. This guy often asked the farmers who had been allocated his houses and land to return the houses and land, and asked the village party secretary for grain. He also wrote a letter to his son in Beijing, asking him to sue the highest people's court, saying that he was being oppressed by cadres and the masses in the village. After his son received the letter, he asked him to write down the names of who was oppressing him and who led the meeting to struggle against him in detail and send it to him. Look at how rampant they are! There are also many other reactionary landlords and rich peasants who assassinated family members, stirred up relations between cadres and the masses, sabotaged cooperatives, sabotaged grain policies, sold grain at high prices, and shouted for lack of grain in the commune… In short, they do not give up their reactionary class stand.
    At this struggle meeting, not only did many party and league members speak, but many people also voluntarily came to the stage to expose them. Their emotions of excitement and indignation are indescribable. Usually, people here are not very willing to attend meetings, and many people are late. However, on this day, everyone didn't even bother to eat, and they weren't afraid that their children would be cold, and they all attended the meeting. The struggle meeting lasted from ten in the morning until two in the afternoon.
    For us, this is a vivid and concrete class education, which is much more effective than reading a few books. How absurd and naive it is to think that the landlord class and reactionaries are all honest and dare not carry out reactionary activities again!

### 在锻炼的熔炉中

专栏：

    在锻炼的熔炉中
    编者按：公安部下放到河北农村劳动锻炼的干部，在下放以后不久，就给他们原工作单位的同志写了很多信，报告他们在劳动锻炼中的初步体会和收获。这里，我们摘要发表四封。
    初过“三关”××同志：
    到这里已经五天了。虽然时间很短，但是所接触的每件事，都是对我的考验和锻炼。
    首先说吃饭吧。我们一到这里，房东就热情地招待我们吃贴饼。把贴饼放到嘴里一嚼，就沙沙地发响，到了喉咙，真不容易往下咽。当我要往外吐时，心想：能不能和农民同吃就看今天了，这是一个考验，共青团员应该经得起考验，突然身上就增加了一股力量，一口就把它咽下去了。当时，我的房东就说：“老钱还能吃！”四、五天来，我们吃的主要是杂粮加糠做成的贴饼、窝头和糠、菜、白薯粥。我承认，在和农民同吃这一关上，是有许多困难的，思想上也经过许多次的斗争，但现在，我可以有把握地告诉你们：我能够坚持下去！
    第二个遇到的问题，是睡觉。我和房东共五口人，都睡在一个炕上。炕又小又挤，再加上老乡们没有卫生习惯，味道也很难闻。第一天晚上怎么也睡不好，可是到第二天，由于干了一天活，晚上一躺下就睡着了，什么挤、臭也全都顾不得了。这几天来我还睡得不错，我看以后习惯了，也就没有问题了。
    第三个问题，是劳动。我们到这里的第二天，就跟老乡下地干活了。头一天是拉地，开始干的时候感到还轻松，可是一天以后，手上就磨了两个大水泡，腰酸腿痛，简直上不了炕。经过这几天的劳动，使我深刻的体会到：劳动的确是一件既伟大又艰苦的事，对待劳动只有老老实实的学习，勤勤恳恳的苦干，才能从劳动中得到美满的果实。
    同志们，虽说我们现在已初步通过了“三关”，但是面前还有许多困难等待着我们。我们有信心去迎接一切困难，战胜一切困难，决不给同志们丢脸！

    要认真地锻炼××同志：
    到这里的第二天，就参加了劳动。目前，主要是铡草和积肥，间或也做些家务劳动。
    十几天中，我学会的活不多，但已闹了不少笑话。第一个下午是铲土，垫圈，活做的不多，手上就磨起了三个大水泡。这个消息，很快就在全村传开了。一次用大扫帚打扫杂草积肥，扫帚怎么拿，都不像个把式，用两手抱着施展不灵。老乡见了就发笑，后来才学着改正过来。挑水已学会。这里是从井里打水，用扁担钩住水桶往井里去打水。我曾几次将水桶掉在井里，心里干着急没有办法。还是靠老乡帮忙，才慢慢地学会了。我铡过一天草，但没有学好。操铡刀时，光是两条胳膊使力，不知道用弯腰俯身的压力，所以又累又铡不好草。
    不仅在生产上一窍不通，就是许多粮食和农具的名称，也认不清。如糜子、荞麦、黑豆、蔓菁等，过去都未见过，牲口用的笼头、木套等，连名字也叫不出来。铡草那天，铡刀口被碎草堵塞住了，老乡要我上院里拿根芝麻秆通一下铡刀口。我在院里找了半天，也找不到芝麻秆。没办法，就拿了一根小木棍回去了。老乡们看到后，都笑了起来。后来才知道，院里堆着大堆芝麻秆呢！
    由于我对农村的东西一无所知，又未经过起码的劳动生产锻炼，光知道吃、穿、用，却不了解这些东西是如何来的，一旦将我放到生产中去，就必然会像“呆瓜”一样，啥也不懂。我没有因此影响情绪，倒是给我增加了一股力量，促使自己认真地锻炼学习。

    无知出笑话××同志：
    下乡后，我们就投入紧张的生产劳动中。目前，我已经上了两堂大课：推水车浇麦子和积肥。经过这些天劳动，首先感到庄稼活确实不是想像的那么简单。比如牛车，看起来没什么，要是仔细一问，名堂可不少啦。什么?秋绳呀，什么搭腰呀，了辕呀……，一下子还真记不住。套牛车是套技术，那些零件往那放，放不对，车就赶不走。谈到赶牛车那更不简单，让牛拐弯抹角，都有口号，口号喊不对，牛就不动弹。我随着掌鞭的（赶大车的老乡）赶过几次牛车。有一次，他让我试验一下，本来向外转应喊“哟”，我记错了，喊成“哟里”，结果牛向里转，弄得我手足失措，还是掌鞭的老乡给纠正过来。
    高正德、刘玉和同志也出了笑话。有一次，他们俩分工看牛拉水车，想让牛停下，可是不知道怎么喊，就大声喊“站着！站着！”牛怎么能听懂呢！还是走。没办法，他们就随着牛转圈。一天，我们大家凑在一块谈起来，说到这件事，萧枫同志和高、刘开玩笑说：“你怎么不喊：牛，暂停。”又不知谁开玩笑说：“你打一个篮球场上的暂停手式就行了”，弄得哄堂大笑。
    这是说赶车。谈起卸车，笑话也不少。听说公安部来的一位同志，在一次卸车时，竟连牛鼻拘也卸下来了，差点闹出乱子。这对老乡来说，是个奇大的笑话，于是这个笑话从他们所在的村，传至我们这村，谁听见谁笑。
    笑话还有，我记得突出的就是在牛身上发生的这两件事。这些笑话，对我们这些人来说并不奇怪，因为没干过，毫无所知。但另一方面也说明，庄稼活儿确实不简单，生产知识对于我们简直是一张白纸。我深深感到：只有虚心地、刻苦地向老乡学习，才能有所获。

    生动的阶级教育××同志：
    6日，我们村开大会斗争不法地主，这是个深刻的生动的阶级教育。这个斗争会告诉我们：地主阶级、反革命分子是“人不死，心不灭”的。
    那天，不少老乡都揭发了不法地主的反扑活动。其中一个最大的地主刘升官，最为猖狂。这个家伙经常向分到他房子、地的农民要房要地，向村支部书记要粮食。他还写信给他在北京的儿子，要他向最高人民法院起诉，说他在村子里受干部和群众的欺压。他的儿子接到信后，就要他把谁欺压他、谁领导开会斗争他的名单，详细写下来给他寄去。看，他们猖狂到什么程度！还有其他不少反动地主富农，暗杀家庭成员，挑拨干部群众关系，破坏合作社，破坏粮食政策，把粮食用高价出卖，又到社里喊缺粮……。总之，是不放弃他们的反动阶级立场。
    在这个斗争会上，不仅党团员发言很多，群众自动上台揭发的也很多。他们那种激动和愤慨的情绪，是无法形容的。平常，这里开会，有的人不怎么愿意参加，不少人还迟到。可是，这一天，大家连饭也顾不得吃，也不怕孩子冷了，都参加了会。斗争会从上午十时，一直开到下午二时。
    对我们来说，这是一课既生动又具体的阶级教育，比读几本书，收效大的多。那种认为地主阶级、反动派全都老实了，不敢再进行反动活动的想法，是多么荒谬，多么天真！
