Assistant Minister Luo's Evil Aura

Recently, a debate arose at a meeting of the Textile Industry Ministry's Rectification Leadership Group regarding the integration of rectification and professional work. At the meeting, Assistant Minister Luo Riyun repeatedly emphasized that his work was "particularly busy" and that "if you want to focus on work, you have no way to focus on rectification," so he "consciously relaxed the rectification movement."

Everyone criticized him for this view, saying it was wrong and should be corrected. Unexpectedly, this touched Assistant Minister Luo Riyun's temper. When a vice minister criticized him, he demanded that the vice minister "experience" his work. When the Party Group Secretary criticized him, he said he had no solution and asked the Party Group Secretary to come up with a solution for him. Comrade Liu Yanbo, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, suggested that he reconsider so that the movement could develop more deeply. Assistant Minister Luo Riyun became even more furious and said: "I, an assistant minister, don't have the high level of you, Liu Yanbo. Why don't you educate me! Should I kowtow to you?"

If Comrade Luo Riyun truly had difficulties balancing work and rectification, he could have calmly raised them for everyone to discuss and resolve. If it was an error in Comrade Luo Riyun's own understanding, he should have carefully considered the opinions of his comrades and tried to correct it. However, Comrade Luo Riyun did not do this, but instead either flew into a rage or used sarcasm towards comrades who offered him opinions. Here, there is both bureaucracy and arrogance, as well as pretentiousness—in short, an evil aura. This evil aura is not what we need, and we must use revolutionary righteousness to eliminate it.

    罗部长助理的邪气
    最近，纺织工业部整风领导小组的会议上，曾为整风和业务工作的结合问题发生了一场争论。在会上，部长助理罗日运同志一再强调他的工作“特别忙”，“要抓工作就没有办法抓整风”，所以他“有意识地将整风运动放松”了。
    大家批评他这种看法不对，应当注意改正，不料，这一下触动了罗日运同志的脾气。一位副部长批评他，他就提出要这位副部长去“体验体验”他的工作，党组书记批评他，他就说他没有办法，请党组书记给他想办法。党委副书记刘延博同志提出请他再行考虑，使运动更深入地发展下去。罗日运同志更是火气冲天地说：“我部长助理没有你刘延博水平高，你教育教育我吧！我向你磕头好不好？”
    如果罗日运同志在工作和整风之间确实存在着困难，尽可平心静气地提出，大家商量解决。如果是罗日运同志自己认识上的错误，就应仔细考虑同志们的意见，设法改正。可是，罗日运同志没有这样做，却对向他提意见的同志不是大发雷霆，就是冷嘲热讽。这里既有官气、又有骄气，还有娇气，总之是一股子邪气。这种邪气不是我们所需要的，我们必须用革命的正气去消灭它。
