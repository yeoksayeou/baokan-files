    Greening
    Zang Kejia
    The green ocean climbs the White Pagoda
    Looking at Beijing, ah, Beijing
    A patch of green velvet, ah,
    How lovely the green velvet Beijing is,
    But the blank spaces still need to be covered, ah.
    The Qingming Festival is a good time, ah,
    Every household is busy planting trees, ah,
    A green umbrella spreads at every door, ah,
    Small mouths of green leaves exhale fragrance, ah.
    The tree saplings are still small, ah,
    Ten years will bring tall trees standing against the wind and smoke, ah,
    The wings of sand and dust can no longer fly, ah,
    Beijing has become a green ocean, ah.
    Barren hills wear green hats, ah,
    A new green streak has been added to the moat, ah,
    Climbing the White Pagoda to look at Beijing again, ah,
    The green velvet Beijing is so lovable, ah.
    A dialogue between a Young Pioneer and a sapling:
    "I'm planting you in this pit,
    Your body only reaches my shoulders,
    But when this time comes next year,
    You will grow taller than me.
    Now you are bare,
    Then you will add a green new outfit,
    When I pass by you again,
    You will clap your green little palms at me."
    "Thank you for cultivating me,
    Thank you for the dirt bed you laid for me,
    My brothers and I grow shoulder to shoulder,
    One person is too lonely,
    One tree cannot make a forest.
    I am willing to compete with you,
    To see who grows stronger,
    We grow in the same climate,
    And bask in the same warm sunlight."

    绿化篇
    臧克家
    绿色的海洋登上白塔望北京呀，北京一片绿茸茸呵，绿茸茸的北京多可爱呀，一条条空白还需要掩盖呵。清明佳节好时光呵，家家户户植树忙呀，每个门口张绿伞呵，绿叶的小口吐芬芳呀。一年的树苗小秧秧呀，十年大树风烟长呵，沙尘的翅膀飞不起了呀，北京成了个绿的海洋呵。荒山秃岭带上绿帽呵，护城河新添了绿的一道呀，登上白塔再望北京呵，绿茸茸的北京爱煞人呀。红领巾和树苗的对话“我把你栽到这个土坑里，你的身子才达到我的肩膀，等到来年这时节，你要长得比我更长。现在你是光秃着身子，那时候你添一身绿的新装，当我再走过你的身旁，你会向我拍起绿色的小巴掌。”“感谢你对我的栽培，感谢你给我铺的土床，我和弟兄肩并肩生长，一个人太孤单，一棵树成不了行。我愿意和你比赛，看看谁长得更扎壮，我们生长在同样的气候里，同样的沐浴着温暖的阳光。”
