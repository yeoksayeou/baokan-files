Protecting Spring Crops from the Cold
Zhejiang Farmers Work Through the Night on Frost Prevention

(Our dispatch) Zhejiang Province farmers are actively preventing cold and frost damage, and strengthening field management of spring crops.

Currently, more than 13 million mu of barley, wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed in Zhejiang Province are generally growing better than last year. The number of times of cultivation and topdressing is generally one or two more than in the same period last year.

Recently, the weather in Zhejiang has changed dramatically, with frequent cold spells, overcast and rainy weather, and strong winds. More than 5 million members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province are working day and night on cold and frost prevention. Many cadres are staying up all night, working alongside the masses in the spring crop fields covering the plants with straw and ash, reducing the harm caused by the cold wave. Farmers in various places are making a concentrated effort to clear ditches for drainage, weed, apply topdressing, and pay special attention to cultivating the few spring crops that have been damaged by frost and the "backward seedlings."

    不让春花受冻
    浙江农民连夜作防寒工作
    本报讯　浙江省农民积极防寒防冻，加强春花作物的田间管理。
    目前浙江省一千三百多万亩大麦、小麦、蚕豆、油菜普遍长得比去年好。中耕追肥一般比去年同期多一两遍。
    近来浙江天气变化很大，寒冻、阴雨、大风不断发生。全省有五百多万农业社社员日夜在作防寒防冻工作，许多干部通夜不眠，和群众一道在春花田里盖草盖灰，减轻了寒潮侵袭的危害。各地农民正在突击清沟排水，除草、追肥，并特别注意培育少数受到冻伤的春花作物和“落后苗”。
