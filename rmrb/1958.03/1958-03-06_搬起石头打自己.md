    Lifting a Rock Only to Drop It on One's Own Feet
    As the Big Power Summit Conference is dawning, the "New York Times" is again spreading various slanders of "beware of Soviet conspiracies." In an article on Soviet foreign policy in the paper on February 23, a curious explanation was given for the Soviet Union's serious attitude towards disarmament: the Soviet Union is particularly active in disarmament because it is a "killing two birds with one stone" trick; on the one hand, it alleviates its own excessive military burden, and on the other hand, it wants to plunge the United States into a serious economic crisis by reducing military spending.
    Saying that the Soviet Union is disarming due to economic difficulties has long been a mantra of Washington politicians, and the "New York Times" is just picking up the leftovers of Dulles and his ilk. This can be seen as how虚妄 (vacuous, absurd) it is simply from the fact that the Soviet Union's economic growth rate reached 10% last year. In fact, it is not the Soviet Union that is overwhelmed by the military burden, but precisely the United States. This can be seen not only from the fact that the US government's military spending accounts for 64% of the budget, but also from the fact that a quarter of its industry relies on the Department of Defense's military orders to maintain itself. And it is precisely because of the latter point that the "New York Times" concludes that "the Soviet Union wants to plunge the United States into a serious economic crisis by reducing military spending."
    The "New York Times" originally wanted to slander the Soviet Union, but unexpectedly exposed the truth that the United States does not dare to take disarmament seriously. This is truly what the saying goes, lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet.

    搬起石头打自己
    在大国政府首脑会议已经曙光在望的时候，“纽约时报”又在散播各种“谨防苏联阴谋”的各种谰调。2月23日在该报一篇谈苏联外交政策的文章中就苏联对裁军问题的认真态度作了一个奇妙的解释：苏联对裁军特别积极是因为这是它的一个“一石双鸟”的诡计；一方面减轻自己的过重的军费负担，另方面想使美国因削减军费而陷入一场严重的经济危机中。
    说苏联是迫于经济困难而裁军，这早已是华盛顿政客们的口头禅，“纽约时报”不过是在拾杜勒斯之流的唾余而已。这点只要从苏联去年经济的增长速度达10％就可以看出是如何的虚妄。其实，被军事负担压得喘不过气来的不是苏联而恰好是美国。这不仅从美国政府的军费占64％的预算中看出来，而且从它的四分之一的工业是依赖国防部的军事订货来维持一点也可以看出来。而且正是由于后一点，才使“纽约时报”得出结论，“苏联想使美国因削减军费而陷入一场严重危机中”。
    本来是想污蔑苏联的“纽约时报”，不料却暴露了美国不敢认真裁军的真情。这真是俗话所说的搬起石头打了自己。
