Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The People's Heroes Monument, standing tall in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, is undergoing its final phase of construction – landscaping – and is expected to be fully completed before May Day. Currently, horticultural workers are continuously transplanting over 390 tall and verdant Chinese pines on both sides of the newly paved stone road leading from the Monument to the Gate of China. These pines symbolize the everlasting achievements of the people's heroes. All areas in the square suitable for greenery will be successively covered with grass. Large flower beds will also be arranged at the four corners of the Monument.

More than fifty outstanding stonemasons from all over the country are meticulously carving the eight large bas-reliefs depicting nearly a century of glorious historical events, as well as two decorative reliefs. The white marble balustrades and upper and lower platforms, which have been installed for over a year, will also be cleaned and refreshed, making the 37.94-meter-high monument even more majestic.

    人民英雄纪念碑五一节前全部竣工
    新华社15日讯　矗立在首都天安门广场的人民英雄纪念碑，正在进行最后一项工程——绿化工程，预计在“五一”节前可全部竣工。现在，园林工人们正在把三百九十多棵高大苍翠的油松，接连移植在纪念碑通到中华门的新铺石板道的两侧。这些油松象征着人民英雄的功绩万古长青。广场里可以绿化的地面，都将陆续铺上草地。纪念碑的四角，还要布置大型花坛。
    来自全国各地的五十多个优秀石工，这几天正在细心地精刻八块记载近百年光荣史迹的大浮雕和两块装饰性浮雕。已经安装了一年多的汉白玉栏杆、上下月台等，也将洗刷一新，使高达三十七点九四公尺的纪念碑，显得更加雄伟。
