    Let the Masses Find Solutions
    The peasants of Huaibei used iron nodules instead of cement, which not only solved the problem of cement shortage but also accelerated the progress of water conservancy projects, and saved a lot of money. This is a good method and should be promoted.
    However, the more significant meaning of this matter lies in its suggestion of a method for solving problems—let the masses find solutions. In socialist construction, we often encounter many problems and difficulties. As soon as one problem is solved, another new problem arises. How to solve these problems? We should go to the masses and let the masses find solutions. The masses are most familiar with production and life, and the masses understand the characteristics of every plant and tree in the local area. As long as the leading cadres are good at relying on the masses, they will come up with good and economical methods in light of local conditions.

    让群众想办法
    淮北农民利用砂礓代替水泥，既解决了水泥不足的困难，又加速了水利工程的进度，并且节省了大量资金。这是一个好办法，应该推广。
    但是，这件事情的更重大的意义，还在于它提示了我们解决问题的方法——让群众想办法。在社会主义建设中，我们经常遇到许多问题和困难，这个问题刚刚解决，另一个新问题又产生了。怎样解决这些问题呢？应该到群众中去，让群众想办法。群众最熟悉生产和生活，群众对当地的一草一木的特性都有了解，只要领导干部善于依靠群众，他们就会因地制宜地想出又好又省的办法。
