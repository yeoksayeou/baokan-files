Xinhua News Agency, 28th - Vice Premier Chen Yi made a report this morning on the self-remolding of members of the democratic parties at a rectification report meeting held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The report meeting was presided over by Li Jishen and Shen Junru, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC.

In his report, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that in the self-remolding process, members of the democratic parties must first, study Marxism-Leninism diligently and conscientiously. Second, social practice is the criterion for testing truth, that is to say, learning must be linked to reality, otherwise it will become empty talk. Now the social practice of the great construction scale of the new China has refuted all the slanders of the rightists. Third, one can deeply understand the correctness of Marxism-Leninism through personal experience. Therefore, we should not only pay attention to the overall social practice, but also pay attention to individual concrete practice. Fourth, political study and ideological remolding should emphasize the principle of voluntariness, take into account the conditions of the elderly and infirm, study in a step-by-step manner, adopt a gentle and gradual approach, gradually accumulate, and create qualitative changes from quantitative accumulation.

    报告会由政协全国委员会副主席李济深和沈钧儒主持。
    陈毅副总理在报告中指出，民主党派人士在自我改造中，第一，要艰苦和认真地学习马列主义。第二，社会实践是检验真理的标准，就是说学习必须联系实际，否则流为空谈。现在新中国伟大的建设规模的社会实践驳翻了右派的一切谰言。第三，通过切身体验才能深切地懂得马列主义的正确性。所以不仅要注重全体的社会实践，还要注重个人的具体实践。第四，政治学习与思想改造要强调自愿原则，要照顾年老体弱等条件，要有步骤地学习，采取和风细雨的方式，逐步地积累，从数量上的积累造成质量的变化。
