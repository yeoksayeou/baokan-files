Leap Forward "One-Top-Ten" Water Wheel

Created by Ma Heshun of the Wanzhong Yixin (United Hearts) Cooperative in Liu Ge Township, Qingfeng County, Henan. Each unit costs about 15 yuan to make. It is very labor-saving and can be used by women with half labor-power. It can irrigate 15 mu of land per day. It has now been promoted throughout the township. (Attached picture)
