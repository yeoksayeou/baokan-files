The Basic Economic Task of the Soviet People

The Proposal of the Soviet Union's Basic Economic Task

In order to improve their living standards and strengthen the powerful material and technical base for building a communist society, the Soviet people have put forward the task of catching up with the most developed capitalist countries economically. This means catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest possible historical period. This is also the basic economic task that the Soviet people have frequently mentioned recently.

After the victory of the October Revolution, the Soviet people inherited an extremely backward economic legacy from Tsarist Russia. In order to change this economic backwardness, Lenin proposed in 1917 that it was necessary to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the economic field. During the first few Five-Year Plans, the Soviet people rapidly transformed an economically backward country into a developed socialist country with both industry and agriculture. Therefore, at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1939, the basic economic task of the Soviet Union was specifically put forward: to catch up with the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest possible historical period. However, the Second World War interrupted the Soviet Union's economic development plan. After the war, the Soviet people continued to advance rapidly by leaps and bounds. Thus, at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956, the issue of resolving the basic economic task in the shortest possible historical period was raised again.

Last year, the Soviet people summarized the brilliant achievements of forty years of construction. The Soviet Union's industrial output has increased 32 times compared with 1913, and it has leaped to second place in the world. At the same time, its proportion in world industrial production has increased from more than 2% in 1913 to about 20%. Now, the United States' industrial products are only 1.6 times higher than the Soviet Union's on a per capita basis, no longer 20.4 times higher as in 1913. In recent years, Soviet agriculture has also achieved unprecedented development. The Soviet Union has also proposed to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita production of milk, meat, and fats in the next few years, and it may catch up with the United States in milk production this year.

While celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, put forward a more specific new task based on the Soviet Union's basic economic task: to catch up with and surpass the current United States in the output of the most important products within fifteen years. This is a decisive step in completing the Soviet Union's basic economic task.

The Soviet Union has a larger population than the United States. If the Soviet Union wants to surpass the United States in terms of per capita output, it needs to produce 20% more products than the United States in total. The United States is the most developed country in capitalist production. Its industrial production accounts for about half of the industrial production of the entire capitalist world. It has undergone two centuries of construction and has never suffered from war damage. It is obviously a very arduous task for the Soviet Union to catch up with the United States in just fifteen years. Only a socialist country that can make production advance by leaps and bounds can put forward such a major task.

Comparison of Current Production Levels between the Soviet Union and the United States

Although the Soviet Union has put forward the task of catching up with the United States, this does not mean that the Soviet Union currently produces less than the United States in all products. At present, the Soviet Union already has many products, such as peat, nickel, chromium, manganese, combine harvesters, sugar, wheat, oats, barley, flax, and sugar beets, that have surpassed the United States even on a per capita basis. Others, such as coal, iron ore, woolen fabrics, and cement, may catch up with the United States in the next few years. If we only consider the per capita output of agricultural products, the Soviet Union may catch up with the United States in about six or seven years.

However, it is not so easy for the Soviet Union to catch up with the United States in the production of several of the most important products. For example, as can be seen from Figure (1), the Soviet Union still has a considerable distance to go compared with the United States in terms of the output of steel, oil, and electricity.

Therefore, if the Soviet Union wants to catch up with the United States in fifteen years, it needs to increase its output to the level shown in Figure (2). This means that the output of these important industrial products in the Soviet Union must increase by at least about one time in fifteen years, and some products, such as natural gas, even need to increase by more than ten times. This is obviously an extremely huge task. However, for the Soviet people who are working selflessly under the leadership of the Communist Party, as Comrade Khrushchev said in his report, the time limit for achieving these targets may be shortened.

The Soviet Union Will Definitely Be Able to Catch Up With the United States

The Soviet Union's decision to surpass the United States in these important products is by no means a figment of the imagination. It has reliable guarantees to complete these tasks. First of all, the superiority of the socialist system can ensure the rapid development of the Soviet Union's economy. The fact that the average annual increase in Soviet industrial production is 16.2%, while the United States is only 2.8%, is enough to prove that the Soviet economic system is far superior to the capitalist economic system. This is the fundamental condition for guaranteeing the inevitable victory of socialism in peaceful competition with capitalism.

The Soviet Union not only has a fast rate of production development, but also has a vast territory and abundant resources. Many of the Soviet Union's mineral deposits not only rank first in the world, but also account for a large proportion of the world's total reserves. The Soviet Union's iron ore reserves account for 41% of the world's reserves, manganese ore accounts for 88%, and coal accounts for 57%. Oil reserves are also among the world's leaders. Other mineral reserves such as copper, lead, zinc, bauxite, and mercury all rank first in the world. The Soviet Union has extremely rich water resources. The vast land also provides unlimited potential for the development of agriculture. These endless natural resources can infinitely develop the economy. This is also an important condition for guaranteeing that the Soviet people can complete their basic economic tasks.

At the same time, the Soviet Union has more skilled technical personnel than any other country in the world. Over the past forty years, the Soviet Union has trained 3.8 million specialists, including about one million engineers. In this regard, the United States has lagged far behind the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union trained 80,000 engineers, which is more than three times the number of engineers trained by the United States in the same year.

The outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union's scientific and technological development also play a significant role in promoting the completion of the basic economic tasks, and have already forced the United States to put forward the slogan of "catching up with the Soviet Union" for the first time.

In addition, the existence of the socialist camp and the mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries are conducive to the rapid development of the Soviet economy.

Of course, the production of the United States will also develop in the future. However, the fundamental maladies produced by the capitalist system in the United States itself doom it to defeat in peaceful competition. Everyone knows that the U.S. economy is constantly experiencing crises, and the economic situation is unstable. Since last year, the U.S. economy has experienced a serious recession. Therefore, it is obvious that the steadily advancing Soviet socialist economy will inevitably defeat the unstable American capitalist economy in peaceful economic competition.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are striving to complete their basic economic tasks, first and foremost to catch up with and surpass the current output of the United States within fifteen years. We can imagine that fifteen years later, the Soviet Union, which leads the socialist countries, will rank first in the world in the output of various important products; our country will also catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products; coupled with the rapid development of production in other socialist countries, the face of the world will be greatly changed. At that time, the socialist camp will also leave the imperialist camp far behind in the economic field.

    苏联人民的基本经济任务
    君强
    苏联基本经济任务的提出
    苏联人民为了提高生活水平，为了加强建设共产主义社会的强大物质技术基础，提出了要在经济上赶过最发达的资本主义国家的任务。这就是要在最短的历史时期内，在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。这也就是近来苏联人民时常提到的基本经济任务。
    十月革命胜利后，苏联人民继承了帝俄的一份极其落后的经济遗产。为了改变这种经济落后的现象，列宁在1917年就提出，要在经济方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。在头几个五年计划期间，苏联人民迅速地把一个经济落后的国家建成了一个工农业发达的社会主义国家。因此，在1939年苏联共产党第十八次代表大会上，就具体地提出了苏联的基本经济任务——在最短的历史时期内，在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶过最发达的资本主义国家。但是第二次世界大战使苏联的经济发展计划中断了。战后，苏联人民继续迅速地大踏步前进。这样，在1956年2月苏联共产党第二十次代表大会上，又提出了在最短的历史时期内解决基本经济任务的问题。
    去年，苏联人民总结了四十年来建设的辉煌成果。苏联工业产量比1913年增加了三十二倍，已跃为世界第二位，同时在世界工业生产中所占的比重，已由1913年的2％多增加到20％左右。现在按人口平均计算，美国工业产品只比苏联高一点六倍，再也不是1913年高二十点四倍了。这几年，苏联农业也获得了空前的发展。苏联并且提出要在最近几年内，在按人口计算的牛奶、肉类和油脂的产量方面赶上美国，而且在牛奶产量方面今年就可以赶上美国了。
    在庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫根据苏联基本经济任务，提出了更具体的新任务——在最重要的产品产量方面，十五年内要赶上并超过目前的美国。这是完成苏联基本经济任务的决定性的一步。
    苏联的人口比美国的人口多，苏联要在按人口平均计算的产量上赶过美国，就要生产总量比美国多20％的产品。美国是资本主义国家中生产最发达的国家，它的工业生产约占整个资本主义世界工业生产的一半，它经过两个世纪的建设，并且从来没有遭受过战争的破坏。苏联要在短短的十五年里赶过美国，显然是一项非常艰巨的任务。只有能使生产一日千里向前发展的社会主义国家，才能提出这样重大的任务。
    苏联和美国目前生产水平的比较
    苏联虽然提出了要赶过美国的任务，但这并不是说，目前苏联在各种产品的生产量上都少于美国。目前苏联已有许多种产品，如泥炭、镍、铬、锰、联合机、食糖、小麦、燕麦、大麦、亚麻、甜菜等，即使按人口平均计算，都已经超过了美国。其他如煤、铁矿砂、毛织品、水泥等，最近几年就可以赶上美国。如果单就农产品按人口平均计算的产量来说，苏联大约六、七年内就可以赶过美国。
    但是，在几种最重要的产品的生产上，苏联要赶过美国还不是那么容易的。例如，从图（一）中可以看到，苏联在钢铁、石油和电力等产量方面，同美国还有相当的距离。
    因此，苏联要在十五年内赶过美国，就需要把产量提高到如图（二）所示的水平。这就是说，苏联这几种重要的工业品产量在十五年内，至少要增加一倍左右，有的产品，像天然气甚至要增加十倍以上。这显然是一个异常巨大的任务。但是，对于在共产党领导下忘我劳动的苏联人民说来，正如赫鲁晓夫同志报告中所说的，实现这些指标的期限还可能缩短。
    苏联一定能够赶过美国
    苏联规定要在这些重要产品方面赶过美国，绝不是凭空设想的。它有着完成这些任务的可靠保证。首先是社会主义制度的优越性，能够保证苏联的经济一往直前地飞速发展。苏联工业生产平均每年增加16.2％，而美国只有2.8％，就足以证明苏联经济制度比资本主义经济制度远为优越。这是保证社会主义在同资本主义和平竞赛中必然获胜的根本条件。
    苏联不仅生产发展速度快，而且地大物博，有取之不尽用之不竭的资源。苏联的许多矿藏不仅占世界第一位，而且在世界总蕴藏量中占的比重也很大。苏联的铁矿蕴藏量占全世界蕴藏量的41％，锰矿占88％，煤占57％。石油的储量也位于世界前列。其他如铜、铅、锌、铝土、汞等矿产的储藏量，都占世界第一位。苏联拥有的水力资源是极丰富的。辽阔的土地也为发展农业提供了无限潜力。这些无穷无尽的天然资源，能够无限地发展经济。这也是保证苏联人民能够完成基本经济任务的重要条件。
    同时，苏联拥有的熟练的技术干部，比世界上任何一个国家都多。四十年来，苏联培养出的专门人材有三百八十万人，其中约有一百万工程师。在这方面，美国已大大落后于苏联了。在1957年，苏联培养出来的工程师有八万人，等于美国这一年培养的工程师的三倍多。
    苏联科学技术发展的卓越成就，对促进基本经济任务的完成，也起着很大的作用，而且已使得美国不得不第一次提出“赶上苏联”的口号。
    此外，社会主义阵营的存在，社会主义各国之间的互助合作，都有利于苏联经济以最快的速度向前发展。
    当然，今后美国的生产也会有所发展。但是，美国本身的资本主义制度产生的根本性痼疾，使它注定要在和平竞赛中败北。谁都知道，美国经济不断发生危机，经济情况是不稳定的。从去年起，美国经济又发生了严重的衰退现象。因此，稳步前进的苏联社会主义经济，必然在和平经济竞赛中战胜不稳定的美国资本主义经济，这是十分明显的。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，正在为完成基本经济任务而奋斗，首先是为完成在十五年内赶上并超过美国的目前产量而奋斗。我们可以想像到，十五年后，在社会主义国家中为首的苏联，将在各种重要的产品产量方面跃居世界首位；我国也将要在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国；再加上其他社会主义国家生产的迅速发展，世界面貌必将大大改观。那时候，社会主义阵营在经济方面也会把帝国主义阵营远远地抛到后边。
