Xinhua News Agency, March 26th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS on the 26th: The famous American economist, Perlo, published an article in "Soviet Russia," stating that the United States is currently in the abyss of a recession in business activity, which may become the beginning of a large-scale economic crisis in the world capitalist system. The author writes that no one doubts that the stage of overproduction crisis has already visited the United States.

The author compared the current economic situation in the United States with the economic recession periods of 1949 and 1954. The author continued to say that the current situation is more acute than in the past. The previous two recessions in business activity did not affect all industrial sectors, because new industrial development areas had renewed and expanded production in the United States. The current economic recession is much deeper and broader, and there is no new area that can free the United States from its current situation. The signs of the 1954 economic crisis were limited to the United States alone, but now the entire capitalist world is rolling towards a crisis.

The author continued to write that the actual situation shows that, in order to avoid the crisis, monopoly capital is taking the path of the arms race and military conflicts. Therefore, the most reactionary major enterprise groups are doing everything possible to sharpen the international situation, obstruct disarmament, and intensify the arms race and war preparations. The author said that many economists and capitalists, especially those who are not related to the arms race and war preparations, doubt whether the militarization of the economy can bring economic stability to the country. They believe that there can be a more favorable prospect under peaceful conditions.

    美国著名经济学家佩洛指出
    生产过剩危机已光临美国
    整个资本主义世界都在滚向危机
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科26日讯：美国著名经济学家佩洛在“苏维埃俄罗斯报”上发表文章说，美国现在正处在企业活动衰退的深渊中，这种企业活动的衰落可能成为世界资本主义大规模经济危机的开端。作者写道，现在已经没有人怀疑，生产过剩的危机的阶段已经光临美国了。
    作者把美国当前的经济状况同1949年和1954年经济衰退时期作了一番比较。作者接着说，现在的情况比过去的情况更加尖锐，前两次企业活动的衰退并没有波及所有的工业部门，因为新的工业发展地区曾经使美国的企业活动更新和扩大生产。现在的经济衰退却更加深广得多，没有任何一个新的地区可以使美国摆脱它当前的处境。1954年经济危机的征象只限于美国一国，而现在整个资本主义世界都正在滚向危机。
    作者继续写道，实际情况表明，垄断资本为了避免危机，正在走军备竞赛和军事冲突的道路。因此现在最反动的大企业集团正千方百计地力图使国际局势尖锐化，阻挠裁军，并加紧扩军备战。作者说，许多经济学家和资本家、首先是那些和扩军备战没有关系的人们表示怀疑，通过经济的军事化是否能使国家获得经济上的稳定。他们认为，在和平的条件下才能有比较有利的前景。
