    According to "Soviet Russia," Soviet oceanographers, while investigating the Kermadec Trench north of New Zealand, took a photograph of the Pacific seabed at a depth of 9,960 meters, setting a deep-sea photography record.

    This rare deep-sea photograph was taken by the research vessel "Vityaz" using a camera designed by Zengkevich, a young engineer at the Institute of Oceanography of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. At such depths, the pressure on each square centimeter of the camera's surface is as high as one ton.

    During its long voyage from Vladivostok to the New Zealand archipelago, the "Vityaz" took a total of 220 hard-won photographs that revealed the secrets of the seabed. For example, a photograph taken at a depth of 3,000 meters particularly surprised the geologists and biologists on board the "Vityaz." This photograph clearly showed a huge marine animal that scientists are still unaware of. These photographs are considered an important contribution to ocean research.

    苏联科学技术消息
    据“苏维埃俄罗斯报”报道，苏联海洋学家在考察新西兰以北的刻马得克凹地时，摄成了一张九千九百六十公尺深处的太平洋海底照片，创造了深水摄影的纪录。
    这一稀有的深水照片是科学考察船“勇士号”利用苏联科学院海洋学研究所青年工程师曾凯维奇设计的一种照相机摄得的。在这样深的地方，照相机表面每一平方厘米受到的压力高达一吨左右。
    “勇士号”在从海参崴到新西兰群岛的漫长途程中，一共摄取了二百二十张很难获得的、揭露海底秘密的照片。例如，有一张在三千公尺深处拍得的照片，就特别使“勇士号”上的地质学家和生物学家感到惊奇。这张照片上可以清楚看到科学家至今还不知道的一个巨大海洋动物。这些照片被认为是对海洋研究的一项重要贡献。
