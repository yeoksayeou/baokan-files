    Jinsha County Holds New and Old Ploughing Competition
    New Agricultural Tools Defeat Old Ploughs
    Recently, Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, held a new and old ploughing competition at the Dashui Farm. More than 900 farmers of various ethnic groups who were gathered in the county to learn the use of new agricultural tools, visited the competition.
    The participants in the competition included tractors, double-wheel double-share ploughs, mountain ploughs, seven-inch walking ploughs, and wooden ploughs. When the command to start the competition was issued, the tractor took the lead, running fast and ploughing deeply and evenly. Huang Yuqing, the operator of the double-wheel double-share plough, was not to be outdone. He waved a bamboo stick and urged the two oxen forward, and large pieces of soil were turned over like tofu from the ploughshare. This scene worried Xu Jixiang, a skilled ploughman using an old plough. He tried hard to drive a large water buffalo, stumbling and staggering along, not only ploughing slowly and shallowly, but also exhausting both the man and the ox with sweat. Two hours passed. The announced results of the competition were: the tractor ploughed 13.4 mu of land, 9 inches deep; the double-share plough ploughed 2.97 mu, 7.2 inches deep; the mountain plough ploughed 1.41 mu, 6.5 inches deep; and the wooden plough ploughed only 0.93 mu, with a depth of only 5 inches. At this time, the audience discussed in small groups. They ranked these agricultural tools: the tools pulled by the tractor are the eldest brother, the double-wheel double-share plough is the second brother, the mountain plough is the third brother, and the wooden plough is the old laggard.
    On the same day, people returned from the farm to the city and immediately bought and pre-ordered 406 double-wheel double-share ploughs and 686 mountain ploughs from the county supply and marketing cooperative, as well as 341 single-share ploughs without wheels. Together with the new agricultural tools originally owned by the 911 agricultural cooperatives in the county, 80% of the county's land can be cultivated with new ploughs this year.

    金沙县举行新旧犁耕地比赛
    新式农具打败了旧犁
    贵州金沙县最近在大水农场举行了一次新旧犁耕地比赛。正在县里集中学习新式农具使用技术的九百多名各族农民，参观了这次比赛。
    参加比赛的有拖拉机、双轮双铧犁、山地犁、七寸步犁和木犁。当比赛开始的口令发出以后，拖拉机就一马当先，跑得快，又犁得深匀。双轮双铧犁的操作手黄玉清也不甘落后，他挥动竹枝，?喝着两头黄牛前进，大片泥土就像豆腐一样随铧口翻了过来。这情景可把使用旧犁的耕作能手徐继祥急坏了，他使劲地赶着一头大水牛一歪一倒地走着，不但犁得又慢又浅，人和牛都累得汗水直流。两小时过去了。宣布的比赛结果是：拖拉机耕十三点四亩地，深九寸；双铧犁耕二点九七亩，深七点二寸；山地犁耕一点四一亩，深六点五寸；木犁耕零点九三亩，深度只五寸。这时，观众们三五成群地议论开了。他们给这几种农具排了队：拖拉机牵引的工具是老大哥，双轮双铧犁是二哥，山地犁是三哥，木犁是老落后。
    当天，人们从农场回到城里，就向县供销社现买和预订了双轮双铧犁四百零六部，山地犁六百八十六部，无轮一铧犁三百四十一部，加上全县九百一十一个农业社原有的新式农具，今年全县有80％田的土可以使用新式犁来耕作了。
