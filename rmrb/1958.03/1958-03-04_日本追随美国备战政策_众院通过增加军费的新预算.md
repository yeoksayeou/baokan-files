    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd: The Japanese House of Representatives passed the 1958 national budget at a plenary session held this afternoon. Of the 410 members who participated in the vote, 143 voted against the budget, which has been submitted to the House of Councillors for discussion.
    The budget draft, totaling 1,312.1 billion yen in both revenue and expenditure, passed by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet on January 19, was opposed by members of the Japan Socialist Party in parliamentary sessions and criticized by public opinion.
    Before the House of Representatives passed the budget, Japan Socialist Party member Airo Kitayama spoke, accusing the budget of being one that showed the Japanese government's subordination to the United States and its intention to rearm. In his speech, Kitayama also expressed opposition to the Japanese government's plans to expand the "Self-Defense Forces" and equip the Japanese military with U.S.-made "Sidewinder" missiles.
    According to the budget draft proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, Japan's military expenditure for 1958 totals 146.165 billion yen, an increase of 5.065 billion yen compared to 1957. With the increase in military spending, the Japanese "Defense Agency" has formulated plans to further expand Japan's naval, land, and air forces.
    In his speech, Kitayama Airo pointed out that the budget draft proposed by the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is also a budget that favors big capitalists at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises, workers, and farmers. The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's provision in the budget draft to increase pensions for former soldiers is an attempt to win votes for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in the general election.
    When discussing the Japanese government's economic policy, Kitayama Airo advocated that Japan expand trade with the Soviet Union and China.

    日本追随美国备战政策
    众院通过增加军费的新预算
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本国会众议院在今天下午举行的全体会议上，通过了1958年度的国家预算。在参加投票的四百一十名议员中，有一百四十三名议员投票反对这项预算。这项预算已经提交参议院讨论。
    岸信介内阁在1月19日通过的岁出和岁入总额都是一万三千一百二十一亿日元的预算草案，曾经在国会会议上遭到日本社会党议员的反对，并且遭到社会舆论的抨击。
    日本社会党议员北山爱郎在众议院通过这项预算以前发言，指责这项预算是表明日本政府从属于美国和进行重新武装的预算。北山爱郎在发言中，还表示反对日本政府关于扩充“自卫队”和用美国“响尾蛇式”导弹装备日本军队的计划。
    根据岸信介内阁提出的预算草案，日本在1958年度的军事开支共为一千四百六十一亿六千五百万日元，比1957年度增加了五十亿六千五百万日元。在军费增加的情况下，日本“防卫厅”拟订了进一步扩充日本海、陆、空军的计划。
    北山爱郎在发言中指出，岸信介内阁提出的预算草案还是一项有利于大资本家而不利于中小企业、工人和农民的预算。岸信介内阁在预算草案中规定增加旧军人的年金，是企图为执政党自由民主党在大选中争取选票的措施。
    北山爱郎在谈到日本政府的经济政策时，主张日本扩大同苏联和中国的贸易。
