Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 17th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" reported today that the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 15th, calling on the people of Japan to launch a movement to demand the publication of a declaration declaring Japan a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The statement also called on the people of Asian countries to join hands with the Japanese people to strive to make Asia a nuclear-weapon-free zone and to strive for lasting peace in Asia. The statement accused the US ruling class of refusing to abandon its "position of strength" and is expanding its armaments, and is attempting to drag many countries in Western Europe, the Middle East, and Asia into its own atomic strategic system, forcing them to set up US nuclear weapons and missile bases in their own countries.

The statement pointed out that Japan and Okinawa under US occupation have rapidly become US nuclear weapons and missile bases, and US aircraft carrying atomic bombs are constantly circling over Japan.

The statement then accused Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi of verbally opposing the US moving nuclear weapons into Japan. However, in reality, he is pursuing the US's "position of strength" policy and assisting the US in establishing an atomic strategic system in Japan.

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party believes that it is now necessary to tell the Japanese people that Japan's situation is very dangerous. The statement said that when nuclear weapons can hit any place on earth in an instant, peaceful coexistence is the only means for people all over the world to strive for happiness. But the United States, under the pretext of "for the security of Japan," attempts to arm Japan with nuclear weapons. The statement pointed out that this method will absolutely not protect the safety of the Japanese people and the country, but on the contrary, it will bring incalculable damage to the Japanese people and the country.

The statement said that the Japanese people, who suffered the tragedies of atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb explosions in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini Atoll, have launched large-scale movements in the past to oppose nuclear weapons, oppose war, and strive for peace. At present, under the new situation, the Japanese people's movement for peace should develop further.

The statement called on all Japanese people to launch a movement to demand that the Japanese government and the Diet make Japan a nuclear-weapon-free zone in order to get rid of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, for the safety of Japan, and to defend peace in Asia and the world.

    日共号召全国人民展开运动
    争取使日本成为无核武器区
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党中央委员会15日发表了一项声明，号召日本全国人民展开运动，要求发表一项宣言，宣布日本为无核武器区。声明同时呼吁亚洲各国人民同日本人民携起手来，努力使亚洲成为无核武器区，争取亚洲的持久和平。声明指责美国统治阶级拒不放弃“实力地位”的立场，正在扩张军备，并且企图把西欧、中东和亚洲的许多国家拖进自己的原子战略体制里面，强迫它们在自己国家境内设置美国的核武器和导弹基地。
    声明指出，日本和在美国占领下的冲绳已经迅速地变成为美国的核武器和导弹基地，而携带原子弹的美国飞机不断地在日本上空盘旋。
    声明接着指责日本首相岸信介在口头上说反对美国把核武器运进日本境内。但是，实际上却又追随美国的“实力地位”政策，协助美国在日本建立原子战略体制。
    日共中央认为，现在必须告诉日本人民，日本的处境已经非常危险。声明说，当核武器在转瞬之间就能打到地球上任何地方的时候，和平相处已经是全世界人民争取幸福的唯一手段。但是美国竟借口“为了日本的安全”，企图用核武器武装日本。声明指出，这种办法绝对保护不了日本人民和国家的安全，相反地，一定会给日本人民和国家带来不可估量的损害。
    声明说，遭受了广岛、长崎和比基尼岛原子弹和氢弹爆炸的惨祸的日本人民过去为了反对核武器、反对战争和争取和平，展开了规模巨大的运动。目前，在新形势下，日本人民争取和平的运动应该更加向前发展。
    声明号召全体日本人民为了摆脱大规模毁灭性武器的威胁，为了日本的安全以及保卫亚洲和世界的和平，必须展开运动要求日本政府和国会使日本成为无核武器区。
