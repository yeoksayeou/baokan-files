	Ahead of the Season!
	Early Rice Sowing in Counties Along the Yangtze River in Sichuan
	(Our Dispatch) Farmers in most counties along the Yangtze River in Sichuan have started sowing early rice successively. Last year, sowing early rice around "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects) was considered the earliest, but in this leaping forward spring, people have moved it up by more than ten days. They want to firmly grasp the first key to increasing production of double-cropping rice: early sowing! Getting ahead of the season! The Neijiang Special District has sown about 40% of its early rice; the sugarcane planting in the Tuo River basin has also completed 30%.
	In counties such as Qianwei, Jiang'an, Naxi, Jiangjin, Hejiang, and Tongliang, the early rice sowing this year is not only earlier but also of better quality. Most places have chosen fertile fields facing the sun, sheltered from the wind, with shallow mud, and guaranteed water sources as seedbeds, and leveled them two or three times. Generally, early-maturing and high-yielding good varieties are selected.

    抢在季节前面！
    四川境内长江沿岸各县早稻下种
    本报讯　四川长江沿岸大部分县的农民已陆续播种早稻。去年，“惊蛰”播早稻就算是最早的了，可是，在这跃进的春天，人们又提前了十多天。他们要紧紧抓住双季稻增产的第一个关键：早播！抢在季节的前面！内江专区的早稻已播下40％左右；沱江流域的甘蔗播种亦已完成30％。
    犍为、江安、纳溪、江津、合江、铜梁等县今年播种早稻，不但时间提早，而且质量好。各地大都选择了向阳、背风、泥脚浅、有水源保证的肥田做秧母田，平整过两三道。一般都选用成熟期早，产量高的良种。
