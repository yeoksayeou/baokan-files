Leading Cadres Laboring Alongside the Masses
Enterprises Swept Clean of Evil Tendencies

    In the current "Double Anti" campaign in Guangzhou, leading cadres at all levels have been resolutely setting themselves on fire, rectifying while rectifying with vigor and speed, leading to revolutionary improvements in leadership style and working methods.

    Currently, many enterprise cadres are practicing "Three Togethernesses": eating together, living together, and laboring together; and "Three Guarantees": guaranteeing the completion of plans, guaranteeing the mobilization of backward masses, and guaranteeing the implementation of central tasks. Among the responsible cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League in 186 factories in the Central District, over 500 are implementing "Three Guarantees" and "Three Togethernesses." They are determined to eliminate the "Five Auras" and labor alongside the workers, sharing their lives. The Party branch secretary and most of the cadres of the Qishengtang Pharmaceutical Factory have moved back to the factory to live, with the branch secretary and factory director taking the lead in cleaning toilets and going deep into the workshops. The workers, seeing the leaders change as they said they would, immediately putting words into action, were greatly encouraged. They said: "If the leaders are determined to change, not just expressing their attitude on big-character posters, but immediately doing it, we must engage in thorough airing of views and blooming of ideas to guarantee a great leap forward in production."

    Under the influence of an unprecedentedly active democratic life, the relationship between leading cadres and the masses has become closer. Pang Weisheng, the Party branch secretary of the Bada Factory, sincerely accepted criticism from workers at a discussion meeting, dug out the roots of his thinking, and proposed improvement measures, moving workers like Li Yongsheng and Deng Qiong to tears. Worker Hu Wenbin said: "Listening to the leaders' self-criticism, I recalled the pain of workers being beaten, scolded, and oppressed by capitalists in the old society; today we are liberated, and if the leaders have shortcomings, they self-criticize to us, and if we workers have shortcomings, we must resolutely change them." The evil tendencies of some workers in the past, such as making trouble over wages and welfare, picking and choosing easy work, quarreling with each other, and violating labor discipline, have been swept away; a new atmosphere of comparing enthusiasm, comparing hardship, and comparing advancement has been formed.

    The Communist Youth League County Committee Moving to the Countryside is Yielding Great Results

    The leading cadres of the Provincial and County Committees of the Communist Youth League in Jilin Province are determined to eliminate bureaucratic and lifeless tendencies and resolutely improve their work style. Twenty-two Communist Youth League County Committees, including those of Qian'an, Nong'an, Dongfeng, and Kaitong, have moved their offices to the countryside.

    The move of the Communist Youth League County Committees to the countryside has greatly encouraged the youth. They discover problems and solve them promptly, and lead the youth of the entire county to launch a vigorous campaign of digging wells and accumulating fertilizer. After the Communist Youth League Qian'an County Committee moved its office to Xitai Township, its work has yielded great results. Based on the action slogan proposed by the Communist Party Qian'an County Committee, "Determined to leap forward, fight hard for three years, dig wells everywhere, and farm even without rain," they mobilized the youth and masses of the entire township to work day and night on water conservancy and fertilizer delivery.

    Along with the move of the Communist Youth League County Committee offices to the countryside, county Communist Youth League committees have universally established experimental fields, and they have already begun spring plowing preparations in the experimental fields.

    Shenyang's "Double Anti" Sharp Focus Turns to Fiercely Attacking Conservatism

    The sharp focus of the "Double Anti" campaign in Shenyang City has shifted from mainly exposing waste to fiercely attacking conservatism, excavating "Three Isms" and "Five Auras," and all backward phenomena that are detrimental to the socialist cause. Units such as the Third Design Bureau, the Fourth Municipal Company, and the Electrical Machinery Design Institute have all launched a second high tide of airing views and blooming ideas to oppose conservatism, sweep away "Five Auras," and settle accounts of political thought. The staff and workers of the Fourth Municipal Company nominated names and wrote 800 big-character posters for the leaders, personally delivering them to the offices of the Party Committee Secretary and the Manager. Among the more than 100 big-character posters in the Huanggu District People's Court, more than 60% were exposing and criticizing "Five Auras."

    领导干部同群众并肩劳动
    企业中的邪气一扫而尽
    广州市在这次双反运动中，各级领导干部都能够坚决引火烧身，雷厉风行地边整边改，使领导作风和工作方法有了革命性的改进。
    目前，许多企业干部实行了三同：同吃、同住、同劳动，三包：包完成计划、包发动落后群众、包贯彻中心任务。在中区一百八十六个工厂的党政工团负责干部中，实行“三包”“三同”的就有五百多人，他们决心打掉“五气”，和工人群众并肩劳动，一起生活。歧生堂药厂的党支部书记和大部分干部都搬回工厂住宿，支部书记、厂长带头清扫厕所和深入车间。职工们看到领导上说改就改，话到做到，受到极大鼓舞，他们说：领导有决心改，不只是大字报表示态度，而且马上做到，我们一定深入鸣放，保证生产大跃进。
    在民主生活空前活跃的影响下，领导干部和群众的关系更加密切了。八达厂党支部书记庞维善在座谈会上诚恳接受工人批评，并挖出思想根源，提出改进办法，使职工李永生、邓琼等感动得流泪。工人胡文斌说：我听了领导上的检讨，使我回忆起在旧社会时，工人受尽资本家打骂压迫的痛苦；今天解放了，领导上有缺点向我们检讨，我们工人有缺点也要坚决地改。过去有些职工闹工资福利、工作挑肥拣瘦、互相吵吵闹闹、违反劳动纪律的邪气已一扫而光；形成了比干劲、比艰苦、比先进的新风气。
    团县委搬到农村工作有很大起色
    吉林省共青团省县领导干部，决心扫除官风暮气，狠狠改进作风。瞻榆、农安、东丰、开通等二十二个团县委已把办公室搬到乡下。
    团县委搬到乡下以后，对青年们鼓舞很大。他们发现问题及时解决，并带动全县青年展开了轰轰烈烈的打井、积肥运动。共青团瞻榆县委把办公室搬到西太乡之后，工作有很大起色，他们根据中共瞻榆县委提出的“决心跃进，苦战三年，遍地打井，不下雨也种田”的行动口号，动员全乡青少年和群众昼夜不停地兴修水利和送粪。
    随着团县委办公室的下乡，各县团委普遍建立了试验田，目前他们已在试验田里开始了春耕准备工作。
    沈阳双反锋芒  转向猛攻保守
    沈阳市“双反”运动的锋芒，已由偏重揭发浪费转入猛攻保守、挖掘“三个主义”和“五气”以及一切不利于社会主义事业的落后现象。设计三分局、市四公司、电机设计院等单位，都掀起了第二次反对保守、横扫“五气”，算政治思想账的鸣放高潮。市四公司的职工提名指姓地给领导人写了八百张大字报，亲自送到党委书记、经理的办公室。皇姑区人民法院的一百多张大字报中，就有60％以上是揭发和批判“五气”的。
