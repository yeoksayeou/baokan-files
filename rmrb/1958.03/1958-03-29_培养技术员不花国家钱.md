    Training Technicians Without Spending State Money
    The Shanghai Machine Manufacturing School and the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Manufacturing School are implementing a half-work, half-study teaching system. This year, they will train qualified technicians for the state without spending a single yuan of state money. These two schools have already begun organizing students to participate in labor for about one-third of their study time, using the schools' practice factories to accept orders from industrial departments.

    培养技术员不花国家钱
    上海机器制造学校和上海电机制造学校实行半工半读的教学制度，今年做到为国家培养合乎规格的技术员而不花国家一元钱。这两所学校已开始组织学生以三分之一左右的学习时间参加劳动，利用学校的实习工厂接受工业部门的订货。　（余辉音）
