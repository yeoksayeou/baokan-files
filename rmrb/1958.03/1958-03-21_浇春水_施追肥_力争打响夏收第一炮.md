Pour Spring Water, Apply Topdressing Fertilizer
Strive to Win the First Battle of the Summer Harvest
    (Our report) Across the country, winter wheat producing areas are carrying out spring irrigation, fertilization and other work on summer crops. According to statistics up to early March, the nine provinces of Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, and Hunan have applied topdressing fertilizer to over 360 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the summer crop area in these nine provinces. The six provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu have irrigated over 55 million mu of wheat fields, accounting for 26% of the wheat field area in these six provinces.
    The wheat-producing areas of the northern provinces have fully utilized the results of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns from last winter and this spring, promoted the experience of "five irrigations and three fertilizations," and vigorously carried out irrigation and topdressing. In Shandong Province, over 43 million mu out of a total of 59 million mu of wheat have been topdressed and irrigated. In Henan Province, over 74 million mu of wheat fields have been topdressed, accounting for 87.3% of the 85 million mu total. Shaanxi Province is currently vigorously carrying out a spring irrigation campaign. In Hanzhong City, 90% of the summer-harvested fields were irrigated once within three days.
    Most areas in the southern provinces have changed the previous habit of emphasizing spring planting over minor spring planting and have strengthened field management of crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and green manure. Jiangsu Province launched a "Three Wheat Cultivation Assault Week" in mid-March to comprehensively strengthen the cultivation of the three wheats, aiming to eliminate second- and third-class wheat seedlings before the "Vernal Equinox." Hubei launched a province-wide campaign of topdressing, weeding, and pest control to eliminate third-class seedlings. Farmers in Hunan are seizing the opportunity of warming weather to process and cultivate crops such as wheat and rapeseed. By mid-March in Anhui Province, all 58 million mu of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops across the province had been topdressed once, with over 50% having been topdressed two to three times. In the Huainan and Yangtze River areas, wheat and rapeseed have also been weeded one to three times.
    Recently, most areas of the country have experienced widespread rainfall. Some areas in Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces are seizing this favorable condition to launch a concentrated topdressing or weeding campaign on wheat fields while the soil is still moist. After this rainfall, farmers in Henan Province carried out soil moisture conservation activities such as weeding, harrowing, and rolling on over 80 million mu of wheat fields. Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, seized the opportunity after the rain to launch a night-time assault on weeding to conserve soil moisture.

    浇春水　施追肥
    力争打响夏收第一炮
    本报讯　全国各冬小麦产区正在对夏熟作物进行春浇、施肥等工作。截至3月上旬的统计，山东、河北、河南、陕西、江苏、安徽、浙江、湖北、湖南九个省已施追肥三亿六千多万亩，占这九省夏熟作物面积的80％以上，河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃六个省已浇麦田五千五百多万亩，占这六省麦田面积的26％。
    北方各省麦产区，充分利用了去冬今春兴修水利和积肥运动的成果，推广“五水三肥”的经验，大力进行了浇水、追肥。山东全省五千九百多万亩小麦已有四千三百多万亩追过肥和浇过水。河南省八千五百万亩麦田已追肥七千四百多万亩，占87.3％。陕西省目前正大力开展春灌运动。汉中市三天内就将90％的夏熟田浇了一次。
    南方各省多数地区都改变了以往重大春轻小春的习惯，加强了对大、小麦、油菜、绿肥等作物的田间管理。江苏省在3月中旬开展一个三麦培植突击周，全面加强三麦的培植，在“春分”以前消灭二、三类麦。湖北开展了全省规模的追肥、除草、防虫，消灭三类苗的运动。湖南各地农民正在抓紧气候转暖时机，加工培育小麦、油菜等作物。安徽省到3月中旬，全省五千八百多万亩小麦、油菜等作物普遍追肥一次，有50％以上追肥二到三次；淮南和沿江地区的小麦、油菜，还全部锄草一到三次。
    最近，全国大部地区普遍降雨。河南、河北、山西、陕西等省的一些地区都在抓住这一有利条件，趁墒向麦田突击追肥或锄地保墒。河南省农民在这次雨后，对八千多万亩麦田分别进行了锄麦、耙麦、辗麦等保墒活动。陕西蒲城县抓紧雨后时机，连夜突击锄麦保墒。
