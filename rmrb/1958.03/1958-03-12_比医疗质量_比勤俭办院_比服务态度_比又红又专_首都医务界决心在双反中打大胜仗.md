Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: At the Beijing Municipal Medical Community's Anti-Waste, Anti-Conservatism, Comparing-Advanced, Comparing-More-Faster-Better-Cheaper rally held today, more than three thousand medical workers expressed their determination to make a great leap forward in medical work. The meeting also proposed an initiative for Beijing hospitals to launch a friendly competition with hospitals in Shanghai and Tianjin. The competition conditions mainly focus on comparing the quality of medical treatment and prevention: shortening the length of hospital stays, increasing the cure rate, and improving the accuracy of diagnoses. Each hospital should undertake the health and epidemic prevention work of at least one area; comparing thrift in running hospitals: saving 17% of administrative expenses, reducing fees by 35%, tapping the potential of existing equipment, and adding a total of 1,500 beds, including regular and simple beds, without state investment. All hospitals and clinics in the city should universally implement 24-hour outpatient services and remain open as usual on Sundays; comparing service attitude: achieving "four goods and four cares" for patients: good treatment, good attitude, good publicity and explanation, good care, and caring about the patient's sleep, diet, emotions, and changes in their condition; comparing being both Red and expert.

Xu Yunbei, Vice Minister of Health, spoke at the meeting. Wang Dingkun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, emphasized in her speech at the meeting that striving for a great leap forward in medical work must be realized on the basis of deeply carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign to eliminate bureaucracy, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness. She hoped that everyone would win a great victory in the "Double-Anti" campaign, so that the medical community can achieve a great leap forward in ideology, medical science and technology, and hospital management systems, and that hospital work can establish a new ethos of mutual cooperation and putting patients first in everything.

    比医疗质量　比勤俭办院
    比服务态度　比又红又专
    首都医务界决心在双反中打大胜仗
    新华社10日讯　在今天举行的北京市医务界反浪费反保守比先进比多快好省大会上，三千多医务工作者表示了要使医务工作大跃进的决心。会上并提出了北京市医院向上海、天津医院展开友谊竞赛的倡议。竞赛条件主要是比医疗预防质量：缩短住院日，提高治愈率，提高诊断准确率。每一医院至少作一个地段的卫生防疫工作；比勤俭办医院：节约行政经费17％，降低收费35％，发挥现有设备的潜在力，不用国家投资增设病床、简易病床共一千五百张。全市医院、门诊部普遍实行二十四小时门诊，星期日照常门诊；比服务态度：对病人作到四好四关心：治疗好、态度好、宣传解释好、照顾好，关心病人的睡眠、饮食、情绪、病情变化；比又红又专。
    卫生部副部长徐运北在会上讲了话。中共北京市委宣传部副部长王定坤在会上讲话时强调指出争取医务工作大跃进，必须在深入开展反浪费反保守打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气的基础上才能实现。她希望大家在“双反”运动中打一个大胜仗，使医务界能在思想上在医疗科学技术上，在医院的管理制度上，都有一个大跃进，使医院工作能树立互相协作处处为病人的新风尚。
