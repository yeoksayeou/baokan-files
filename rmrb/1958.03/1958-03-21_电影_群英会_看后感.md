    Impressions of the Movie "The Gathering of Heroes"
    Zhang Zhen

    "The Gathering of Heroes" is one of the most exciting stories in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and a masterpiece of Chinese military-themed literature. The movie "The Gathering of Heroes" brings together some famous Peking Opera actors to film this well-known traditional Peking Opera repertoire, which is of great significance. In particular, the complete recording of Mr. Xiao Changhua, who is eighty years old, playing Jiang Gan's body movements, will enable many younger generations to observe and learn. In this play, Jiang Gan has a very rich inner performance as soon as he appears on stage. He comes to Zhou Yu with ulterior motives. Unexpectedly, Zhou Yu sees through his intentions as soon as they meet. He panics and wants to slip away, but Zhou Yu stops him to drink. He twirls his small beard, uneasy and doubtful. When Zhou Yu unsheathes his sword and hands it to Taishi Ci: "Anyone who mentions the military affairs of Sun and Cao will be beheaded on the spot!" Jiang Gan is even more stunned. Here, the film first shoots Taishi Ci smiling coldly while holding the sword, then shoots Jiang Gan supporting the table in a daze, and then shoots Zhou Yu smiling secretly and calling Jiang Gan. Jiang Gan doesn't hear him until Huang Gai nudges him, and then he wakes up. This small plot is a brilliant part of the original play's direction, and it is further emphasized in the movie. Also, when Jiang Gan steals the book, after he gets the book, he suddenly leans to the side and squats beside the table, and then slowly peeks out from the table leg to see Zhou Yu's movements, which is clearer than on the stage. Xiao Changhua's Jiang Gan does not have superfluous or trivial movements; his movements are refined and accurate. What is most impressive is that he uses several different gaits, vividly setting off Jiang Gan's character, his timid mood, and his triumphant mood. An old actor once told me: the most difficult thing about characterization is the footwork. Being able to use the footwork to portray a person's character and psychology means that the acting is top-notch. Xiao Changhua's Jiang Gan reminded me of these words.
    This film very faithfully fulfills the responsibility of a documentary. The so-called faithful is not to shoot the stage directly with the camera, but to focus on shooting the focal point of the audience's attention in each unit. When watching a play, the audience does not look at the entire stage with their eyes; sometimes they look at this person, sometimes they look at that person, sometimes they look at the eyes, sometimes they look at the gestures. The film's directors need to use the camera to follow their eyes and shoot these parts, so that the audience will have the same impression as watching a stage play. This film does a good job of this. For example, when Zhou Yu asks Kong Ming to make 100,000 wolf-fang arrows in three days, Lu Su is afraid that Kong Ming will make a military order, and wants to stop him several times. Zhou Yu hits him with his sleeve and gives him a look, and the film uses close-ups to shoot them, magnifying the movements. This is exactly what the audience pays attention to when watching a play.
    The sound of this film is very good. The gongs and drums are not noisy, and the scene and singing are moderately loud and pleasant to the ear. Zhou Yu's Xipi yuanban, Lu Su and Kong Ming's Yaoban while drinking in the boat, and Cao Cao and Huang Gai's arias, although some of the singing is not much, but sung by these famous actors, the audience feels very "satisfied".
    The film uses simple sets: monochrome "antiques," wide screens, carpets without patterns...etc., to highlight the colorful and beautiful costumes of the opera, which seems to be even better than on the stage. Opera concentrates all beauty on the actors, and simple sets are enough to bring the actors to the forefront of the audience's eyes.
    This film faithfully records the acting skills of several famous actors, and has reached a high level in documentaries. However, if a shot or two can be added in some places without damaging the original performance principle, in order to adapt to the characteristics of the film, it will be even better (there are already some, such as close-up shots of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun's letter skin, I think there can be more). For example, when Jiang Gan is reading the letter, if you shoot the letter paper: "Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, surrendered generals of Jingxiang, pay respects to the Governor...", and then shoot Jiang Gan flashing behind the table, it will make the audience immediately understand why he is afraid of Zhou Yu seeing it, which is clearer than just hearing him say a sentence. When borrowing arrows, you can also shoot a few close-ups of the arrows hitting the scarecrows, and then switch to Cao Cao shouting to shoot arrows, which is more ironic.
    In addition, if the lyrics can be printed on the screen, the audience who are not familiar with Peking Opera can hear them clearly. I think this can be tried in future documentaries, like printing out the words of the theme song in the movie, I don't think it will damage the picture much.

### 电影“群英会”看后感

    电影“群英会”看后感
    张真
    “群英会”这一段故事，是三国演义中最热闹的一段，是我国军事题材文学的杰作。电影“群英会”，集中了京剧一些著名演员，把这一个有名的京剧传统剧目拍摄下来，是很有意义的。特别是将年已八十岁的萧长华先生扮演的蒋干的身段动作全纪录下来了，更可以使许多后辈观摩学习。这个戏蒋干一上场就有很丰富的内心表演，他是怀着鬼胎来周瑜这里的。不料一见面心事就被周瑜说破。他慌急想溜，又被周瑜拦住吃酒。他捻着小胡，惊疑不定。当周瑜解下佩剑交给太史慈：“有人提起孙曹军旅之事者，即席斩之！”蒋干更吓得发呆。这里电影先拍太史慈持剑冷笑，然后拍蒋干扶桌发楞，再拍周瑜暗笑，唤蒋干，蒋干没听见，直到黄盖把他一碰，这才醒悟过来。这一个小情节，是原戏导演上精彩的地方，在电影里更强调了。还有蒋干盗书时，偷书到手后猛然一歪身蹲在桌侧，然后慢慢从桌腿处探头看周瑜的动静，都比舞台显得更清楚。萧长华的蒋干，没有多余的、琐碎的动作，他的动作洗炼而准确。给人印象最深刻的是他用了几种不同的步法，活活地把蒋干的性格，他胆怯时的心情和得意时的心情都烘托出来了。有个老演员曾对我讲：性格化最难的是脚步，能够用脚步把人的性格、心理刻划出来，演技才算到家。萧长华的蒋干，使我想起了这几句话。
    这部片子很忠实地尽了纪录片的责任。所谓忠实，并不是把镜头直对了舞台来拍，而是在每一单元中，着重地拍摄了观众注意的焦点。观众看戏，并不是把眼睛看着全台的，他们有时看这个人，有时看那个人，有时看眼神，有时看手势，电影的编导需要用镜头追随他们的眼光把这些部分拍下来，才会使观众有着与看舞台剧一致的印象。这部片子这一点作的就不坏。像周瑜叫孔明三天造十万支狼牙箭，鲁肃怕孔明立军令状，几次要拦，周瑜用袖子一打，一递眼神，影片都用近景拍下来，使动作放大了。这正是观众看戏所注意的地方。
    这部片子声音很好，锣鼓不觉吵的慌，场面和歌声都音量适中而悦耳，周瑜的西皮原板，鲁肃、孔明在舟中饮酒的摇板，和曹操、黄盖的唱词，有的唱虽不多，但经这些著名演员唱来，使观众感到很“过瘾”。
    影片用简单的布景：单色的“守旧”，宽大的屏风，没有花纹的毯子……等，衬托出了戏曲服装的色彩华美，比舞台似乎更好看一些。戏曲是把一切美全集中在演员身上的，简单的布景正足以把演员突出到观众的眼睛前面来。
    这部片子忠实地纪录了几位名演员的演技，在纪录片中达到了较高的水平。但有些地方在不损伤原来演法的原则下，如能适应电影特点，稍加一两个镜头，当会更好（现在已有一些，像蔡瑁、张允的信皮就有特写镜头，我想还可以有一些）。像在蒋干念信时如拍摄信纸：“荆襄降将蔡瑁张允拜上都督……”，然后再拍蒋干闪在桌后，就会使观众立刻了解他为什么怕周瑜看见，比光听他念一句给人印象清楚。借箭时也可以拍几个箭射中草人的特写，再转到曹操大叫放箭的镜头，就更有讽刺意味了。
    此外，唱词如果能够印在画面上，不熟悉京剧的观众就可以听清了。我想这在以后的纪录片上可以试一试，像电影里的主题歌那样印出字来，我看也不大损害画面的。
