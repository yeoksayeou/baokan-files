    Cave Pig Farming
    Recently, many agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province have been using caves for pig farming, saving on investment in basic pigsty construction.

    Cave pig farming was created by farmers in Xinhui County and Zhongshan County and has the advantages of raising more pigs at a lower cost. Each cave can house a sow and a litter of piglets, or five fattening pigs. Pigs are much more comfortable living in caves than in ordinary pigsties. When the weather is hot, they rest in the cave during the day and come out to cool off near the cave entrance in the evening. When there is a chill late at night, they return to the cave to sleep. Piglets can also jump around on the vast mountain slopes, so their growth rate is very high. At the same time, because piglets often gnaw on the red soil in the cave, increasing their mineral intake, they rarely suffer from diarrhea and other diseases. The survival rate generally reaches 95%, which is more than 7% higher than that of pigs raised in pigsties. Usually, each sow (including nursing piglets) requires seven square meters of pigsty space, and at the lowest construction cost, it costs 42 yuan in basic construction fees to raise one sow. Using caves for breeding does not cost money, only three working days. (With picture) (Li Shaoqiu, Liang Desheng)

    山洞养猪
    最近广东省有许多农业社用山洞养猪，节约猪舍基本建设的投资。
    山洞养猪是新会县和中山县农民创造的，具有养猪多、成本低的优点。每一个山洞可以养上一只母猪和一窝小猪，或是饲养五只肉猪，猪住在洞里比住在一般猪舍里舒适得多。天气炎热的时候，它白天就在洞里休息，傍晚出洞口纳凉，深夜有寒意时又回到洞里睡觉；小猪还可以在广阔的山地上蹦蹦跳跳，所以长肉率很高。同时由于小猪常常啃吃洞里的红土，增加了矿物质，所以很少发生下痢和其他疾病，成活率普遍达到95％，比在猪舍养的提高7％以上。通常每个母猪（连哺乳的仔猪）要占七平方公尺的猪舍，以最低造价计算，每养一头母猪要四十二元的基建费。用山洞饲养，不必花钱，只花三个劳动日就行了。          （李少球、梁德胜）（附图片）
