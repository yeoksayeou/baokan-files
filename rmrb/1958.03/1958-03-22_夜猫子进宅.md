A Party branch secretary at a construction site, after seeing a big-character poster criticizing him for not going deep into the workers' living quarters, went to the workers' quarters that very day. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered, a worker said to him, "Night owl enters the house, only comes when there's trouble."

These nine words of welcome gave the branch secretary a jolt.

It seemed that this worker's demand was somewhat harsh. To go from never entering the workers' quarters to stepping inside was already a great improvement in work style, wasn't it already a big step forward? However, this branch secretary still thought carefully about it and felt that the criticism was correct, so he immediately moved his bedding into the workers' quarters. From then on, he had more time to chat with the workers. They chatted while eating, they chatted while lying in bed, and they chatted while playing chess when there was nothing to do, bringing out many production and ideological problems. These were all situations that could not have been understood by only listening to reports in the past.

From this, it seems that the criticism of "night owl enters the house" is still worth thinking about.

Indeed, some of our cadres' contact with the masses is of the "night owl enters the house" type, the characteristics of which can be summarized in three sentences: "Doesn't come unless there's something to do, comes only when there's something to do, leaves as soon as the matter is finished." Compared with those who keep their hands in their pockets and reject the masses from a distance, it is naturally much better. However, it is indeed very insufficient. Interactions with the masses are limited to when there is something to do, and as soon as the matter is finished, they turn around and leave, as if the "doing business" is too strong, and also too rushed. This "business" flavor, this hurried look, is obviously not conducive to making friends and talking about inner thoughts.

There are also those who defend the "night owl enters the house" style of contacting the masses: "If there is something to do, you can discuss it with the workers. What's the point of being with the workers all the time when there's nothing to do?" This seems to make some sense. Doing things should have a clear purpose, what's the point of being with the workers all the time when there's nothing to do? However, upon careful consideration, there are also many problems here. What is considered something to do, and what is considered nothing to do? The so-called "thing" is a contradiction! Where there is contradiction, there is something to do, and contradiction is absolute, existing at any time and any place. Where would there be a time when there is nothing to do? Saying there is nothing to do is an excuse for bureaucrats, or the contradiction has not yet developed to the point of being superficial, and you have not yet discovered it, so it is just an illusion.

The relationship between cadres and the masses is like the relationship between fish and water. Fish live in the water, not just looking for water to drink when they are thirsty. Cadres should live among the masses, not just look for the masses when there is something to do, and leave the masses aside when there is "nothing to do." Those who use the "night owl enters the house" method of contacting the masses are only those who have half the mass viewpoint. They contact the masses when they are at work, and only contact their wives, children, and parents after work; they contact the masses when there is something to do, and do not contact the masses when there is nothing to do. As a result, of course, they cannot truly become one with the masses, and therefore often delay things. It is reasonable that the masses are not satisfied with these cadres.

The Party teaches us: No matter how "high" one's "official" position is, one must appear in the middle of the people in the posture of an ordinary worker, making people feel that you have given your heart to them. To achieve this, we must abandon the "night owl enters the house" method of contacting the masses, wholeheartedly live among the masses, and truly become one with the masses. Now, some have moved to live in the workers' quarters, and some are following shifts to work. As for those who really cannot move to live in the workers' quarters and cannot follow shifts to work, they should also seriously solve the problem of the mass viewpoint ideologically.

    夜猫子进宅
    吴滤
    一个工地的党支部书记，看到工人贴大字报批评他不深入工棚，当天就到工棚里去了。不料刚进门，就有个工人冲着他说：“夜猫子进宅，无事不来。”
    这九个字的欢迎词，使支部书记心头一震。
    看来，这位工人的要求像是苛刻了些。从不入工棚，到跨进工棚，已经是工作作风上一个很大的改进了，不已经是很大的进步了吗？然而，这位支部书记还是细想了一下，觉得批评得对，当即又把铺盖搬到工棚里去。从此，同工人聊天的时间就多了。吃饭也聊，躺在床上也聊，没有事的时候下下棋也聊，聊出许多生产上和思想上的问题来。这些，都是过去光听汇报不可能了解到的情况。
    这样看来，“夜猫子进宅”的批评，也还是值得想一想的。
    确实，我们有些干部联系群众，就是“夜猫子进宅”式的，其特点可以概括为三句话：“无事不来，来必有事，事完即走”。这同两手插在裤袋里，拒群众于千里之外的人比起来，自然强多了。然而，也确实很不足。同群众来往只限于有事情的时候，事情办完，转身就走了，似乎“办事”的味道太浓，而且也过于匆忙了。这种“办事”的味道、匆忙的神色，显然是不利于交朋友、谈心思的。
    也有为“夜猫子进宅”式的联系群众的方法辩护的：“有事就找工人商量，没有事老同工人泡在一起有什么意思呢？”这话似乎也有些道理。做事要有明确的目的，没有事老同工人“泡”有什么必要呢？然而，细细推敲，这里也有很多问题。什么叫有事，什么叫没有事？所谓“事”者，矛盾也！有矛盾就有事，而矛盾是绝对的、任何时候任何地方都存在，那里会有没有事的时候呢？说没有事，那是官僚主义者的借口，或者是矛盾还没有发展到表面化的程度，你还没有发现，因而只是一种假象。
    干部同群众的关系，好比鱼儿同水的关系。鱼儿生活在水里，并不是渴了才找水喝。干部应该生活在群众中间，不能只是有事才去找群众，“没有事”就把群众丢在一旁。大凡用“夜猫子进宅”的方法联系群众的，都是只有一半群众观点的人。他们上班时联系群众，下班后只联系自己的妻儿父母；有事时联系群众，没有事时不联系群众。结果，当然不能真正同群众打成一片，因而常常耽误事情。群众对这些干部不满意，是有道理的。
    党教导我们：任何人不论“官”有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现，使人感到你的心是交给他的。要做到这一点，必须放弃“夜猫子进宅”式的联系群众的方法，全心全意地生活到群众中去，真正同群众打成一片。现在，有搬到工棚去住的，有跟班劳动的，至于那些确实不能搬到工棚去住，又不能跟班劳动的，也应该从思想上认真解决群众观点的问题。
