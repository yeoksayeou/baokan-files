    Xinhua News Agency, March 20th. In the great leap forward in agricultural production, a mass movement to reform tools, the sprout of an agricultural technological revolution, is flourishing in the vast rural areas of the country. Many counties, townships, and agricultural cooperatives in the South, North, Northeast, and border regions are widely mobilizing farmers to improve old-fashioned farm tools, water lifting tools, and transportation tools, and to create and promote new-style farm tools, new-style water lifting tools, and new-style transportation tools. The goal is to reduce the burden of labor, improve labor efficiency, promote spring plowing, ensure a bumper harvest this year, and lay the foundation for the modernization of agriculture.

    Cangxian Prefecture in Hebei, Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei, Huanjiang County in Guangxi, Huangyan County in Zhejiang, Jinnan Prefecture and Qin County in Shanxi, Huaibei area in Anhui, Fangcheng and Changge in Henan, Xiangtan Prefecture in Hunan, Nanchong Prefecture in Sichuan, Shaoguan Prefecture in Guangdong, and Xinbin County in Liaoning are in the forefront of tool reform. Following the principles of using local materials and self-financing, self-manufacturing, self-use, and self-management, they have successively improved and created a large number of advanced tools, setting an example. These regions have created hundreds of tools, including wooden water pumps, wooden pipe waterwheels, fast waterwheels, ox-drawn soil crushers, wooden light railways, cableway transportation lines, automatic revolving mud tipping machines, elevating iron cable soil slides, and rice planting markers, as well as improved farm tools. The common characteristics of these tools are simple structure, easy to use, low cost, and high efficiency, and therefore are generally welcomed by the masses. For example, the wooden pipe waterwheel created in Cangxian Prefecture, which does not use any steel, has a water output of 30 tons per hour, twice that of a five-wheel waterwheel, but costs only 30 yuan per unit, half the price of a five-wheel waterwheel. The "homemade water pump" manufactured in Xinbin County is now widely used on reservoir construction sites because of its high pumping capacity and speed. The fast waterwheel created in Changge County lifts water several times faster than the old-fashioned waterwheel. In order to change from human carrying to cart pushing, Xiangyang Prefecture achieved "cartization" in just over a month. The wooden light railway created in this prefecture requires only one or two people to push things weighing a thousand pounds on this "railway," with labor efficiency generally seven to ten times higher than human, animal, or cart labor. In order to change from human carrying to cart pushing, Xizhanggeng in Jieyu County, Shanxi, converted 2,837 small carts in three days, with a conversion cost of only a few yuan per cart. In addition, a variety of new-style tools have been created for fertilizer accumulation, field management, and agricultural and sideline product processing.

    In order to adapt to the new situation of tool reform in rural areas, Party committees at all levels have established organizations such as "Tool Reform Committees" or "Tool Reform Groups" to lead and mobilize farmers to criticize the idea of "simply waiting for the state to supply machinery" and "asking the state for money, materials, and machinery." They have also specifically solved the "three shortages" of carpenters, tools, and materials, promoting the development of the tool reform movement. In many areas of Hebei, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces, the "three shortages" are mainly solved by relying on the masses and utilizing their wisdom. For example, many agricultural cooperatives in Xiangyang and Gucheng counties in Hubei Province have overcome the shortage of carpenters by having carpenters do fine work and cooperative members do rough work, dividing the work and cooperating, or by teaching each other and taking apprentices. When there are no tools, members use machetes and sickles instead. Old wood and planks are used as materials. In mountainous areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces, farmers use bamboo ropes instead of iron wires to make cableway transportation lines where there is no bamboo, and rattan ropes are used instead of bamboo ropes where there is no bamboo.

    In order to support agriculture, local industry and handicrafts in various places have vigorously carried out the manufacture and improvement of agricultural machinery. After two months of effort, local industries, joint state-private iron factories, and handicraft cooperatives in Jinnan Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have manufactured 72 kinds of agricultural machinery and agricultural tools, including hand-held tractors, pot camel power machines, high-pressure water pumps, power stone mills, automatic air-inflating sprayers, horse-drawn cotton stalk pullers, power wheat reapers, and fertilizer applicators. Members of handicraft cooperatives in Xinhui, Panyu, Chao'an, Boluo, and other counties in Guangdong Province have made extensive use of waste materials and old furniture to manufacture more than a dozen kinds of tools such as ox-drawn carts, ox-drawn mud-dumping carts, handcarts, and two-wheeled carts, generally costing only a few yuan per unit. For example, 20 members of the Zhongcun Township Woodware Cooperative in Panyu County helped the nearby Hanxi Agricultural Cooperative make 146 handcarts in three days and nights. Each cart can carry 200 to 700 pounds, increasing efficiency eight times compared to human carrying. Now this cooperative has abandoned carrying poles and switched to using carts. In addition, many local industrial departments organize leading cadres and technicians to go deep into rural areas to participate in labor, and through labor practice, they recognize the importance of helping farmers reform tools, understand tool conditions and natural conditions, and thus absorb the wisdom and experience of farmers to create, improve, and imitate agricultural tools according to local conditions. These tools are very popular among farmers.

    In addition to reforming tools, some areas in Hubei, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang are also developing animal power, utilizing hydropower, wind power, and bioenergy (biogas) generation as power for various tools. Many agricultural cooperatives in Yichang, Xiangyang, and Enshi in Hubei, and Guanzhong Plain and Gaoling along the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi, use hydropower to husk cotton, grind flour, and mill rice, saving a lot of labor and solving the problem of labor shortage.

    Last winter and this spring, a large-scale agricultural production and construction movement centered on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation was launched in the vast rural areas of the country. In this movement, the broad masses gave full play to their selfless labor enthusiasm and creative spirit, worked hard, and created and improved thousands of advanced tools, improving work efficiency and greatly accelerating the progress of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. As of now, the country has increased its irrigated area by more than 200 million mu and accumulated more than 140 billion dan of fertilizer. Since the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture, the tasks of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation have increased several times to more than ten times compared with previous years. At the same time, there are also a large number of tasks such as greening, land reclamation, dry land conversion to paddy fields, single-cropping rice conversion to double-cropping rice, and strengthening farmland management. Many places feel a shortage of labor, especially during the spring plowing season, the problem of labor shortage is more obvious. Universal tool reform can greatly improve labor efficiency, thus alleviating this contradiction to a considerable extent, which will play a significant role in this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

    亿万农民在工具改革中充分发挥聪敏才智和革命精神
    农业技术革命的新芽遍地生长
    新华社20日讯　在农业生产大跃进中，农业技术革命的萌芽——群众性的改革工具运动，正在全国广大农村中蓬勃开展起来。南方、北方、关外省份和边疆地区的许多县、乡和农业社，正在广泛地发动农民改良旧式农具、提水工具、交通运输工具，并创造和推广新式农具、新式提水工具、新式交通运输工具，来减轻劳力负担，提高劳动效率，推动春耕生产，为保证今年农业大丰收以及使农业过渡到现代化打下基础。
    走在改革工具前列的河北沧县专区，湖北襄阳专区，广西环江县，浙江黄岩县，山西晋南专区和沁县，安徽淮北地区，河南方城、长葛，湖南湘潭专区，四川南充专区，广东韶关专区，辽宁新宾县等，在就地取材和自筹、自造、自用、自管的原则下，已先后改良和创造了大量的先进工具，作出了榜样。这些地区创造的木制抽水机、木管水车、快速水车、牛拉碎土机、木制轻便铁路、滑索运输线、巡回自动倒泥机、升降式铁索溜土器、插秧划行器，以及改良农具等几百种工具。这些工具的共同特点是：构造简单，使用方便，成本低贱，效率很高，因而普遍受到群众欢迎。例如沧县专区创造的完全不用钢材的木制木管水车，每小时出水量为三十吨，比五轮水车多两倍，但每部只需三十元，比五轮水车贱一半。新宾县制造的“土制抽水机”由于抽水又多又快，已经普遍在水库工地上使用。长葛县创造的快速水车比旧式水车提水快几倍。襄阳专区为了改人担肩挑为车推，在一个多月内就实现了“车子化”。这个专区创造的木制轻便铁路，在这种“铁路”上推千把斤重的东西只需一两个人，劳动效率一般比人力、畜力、车拉高七倍到十倍。山西解虞县西张耿为了改变人担为车推，三天内就改制了二千八百三十七辆小车，每辆改装费只需几元。除此之外，在积肥、田间管理、农副业加工等方面，也创造了多种多样的新式工具。
    为了适应农村改革工具新情况，各级党委成立了“工具改革委员会”或者“工具改革组”等组织，领导和发动农民批判了“单纯等待国家供应机械”“伸手向国家要钱、要材料、要机械”的思想，并具体地解决了缺木匠、缺工具、缺材料的“三缺”问题，推进了改革工具运动的发展。河北、湖北、浙江、广东、山西、陕西、甘肃等省许多地区，解决“三缺”问题，主要是依靠群众，发挥群众智慧。例如湖北襄阳、谷城等县许多农业社，采取木匠做细活社员做粗活，分工合作，或者采取你教我、我教你以及带徒弟的办法，克服了木匠不足的困难。没有工具，社员们就用砍刀、镰刀代替。陈旧木料、铺板都被当作了材料。山西、陕西、湖南、江西等省的山区做滑索运输线没有铁丝，农民就用竹子编成竹绳代替铁丝，没有竹子的地方就用青藤编成藤绳子代替。
    各地的地方工业和手工业为了支援农业，大力进行了农业机械的制造和改良。山西晋南专区的地方工业、公私合营铁工厂和手工业社，经过两个月的努力，制造了手扶拖拉机、锅驼动力机、高压水泵、动力石磨、自动打气喷雾器、马拉拔棉秆机、动力割麦机、施肥器等农业机械和农业工具七十二种。广东新会、番禺、潮安、博罗等县手工业社社员，大量利用废料、旧家具等制造牛拉车、牛拉倒泥车、手推车和双轮车等十几种工具，一般只要几块钱一部。例如番禺县钟村乡木器合作社二十名社员用三个昼夜帮助附近的汉溪农业社制成了一百四十六部手推车，每部车可载重二百到七百斤，比人挑提高效率八倍，现在这个社已经丢掉扁担改用车子了。还有许多地方工业部门组织领导干部和技术人员深入农村亲自参加劳动，通过劳动实践认识帮助农民改革工具的重要性，了解工具情况和自然条件，从而吸取农民的智慧和经验，因地制宜地创造、改良和仿制农业工具，这些工具很受农民欢迎。
    除了改革工具外，湖北、陕西、浙江一些地区还大量地发展畜力、利用水力、风力以及生物能（沼气）发电，作为各种工具的动力。湖北的宜昌、襄阳、恩施和陕西的关中平川、沿泾惠渠的高陵等地，许多农业社利用水力轧花磨面、碾米，节省了大量的劳动力，解决了劳力不足的问题。
    去冬今春，全国广大农村开展了规模壮阔、声势浩大的以修水利和积肥为中心的农业生产建设运动。在这一运动中，广大群众发挥了忘我的劳动热情和创造精神，刻苦钻研，创造与改进了千百种先进工具，提高了工效，大大地加速了兴修水利和积肥的进度。截止目前，全国已增加了二亿多万亩灌溉面积，积攒肥料一千四百多亿担。由于农业大跃进以来，水利、积肥任务比往年增加几倍到十几倍，同时绿化、开荒、旱地改水田、单季稻改双季稻以及农田管理加强等大量任务，不少地方感到劳动力不足，特别是春耕期间，劳力不足的问题更加明显，而普遍改革工具就能大大提高劳动效率，从而在相当程度上缓和这一矛盾，这将对今年农业生产大跃进起着重大作用。（附图片）
