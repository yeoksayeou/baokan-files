How to Organize Basic Construction Teams in Mountainous Areas
Zhang Yanjie

Shizhangzi District, Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, is a mountainous area. The entire district's nine townships and forty-seven agricultural cooperatives have only 4,447 hectares of cultivated land, and most of it is terraced and sloped fields. To strengthen construction in the mountainous areas, most agricultural cooperatives established basic construction teams in the spring of 1957. There were thirty-two teams with eight hundred and twenty-two people in the entire district. These teams played a significant role in the construction of the mountainous areas.

In May 1957, the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Qiuzigou Township took the lead in establishing a basic construction team specializing in afforestation, forestry, and soil and water conservation. This cooperative used Lao Fen Mountain (an area of approximately one hundred hectares) as a pilot project for soil and water conservation. This mountain had 4,500 apple trees, planted in 1956, but due to lack of management after planting, they were growing poorly, with thin branches and yellow leaves, and some were on the verge of dying. After the basic construction team weeded, pruned, and fertilized, they quickly transformed from thin branches and yellow leaves to strong branches and lush leaves. The contour pits and trenches dug by the construction team in the mountainous area withstood the test of heavy rain that year, preventing rainwater from flowing down the mountain. This fact greatly educated the masses. The newly planted seedlings nurtured by the basic construction team also grew more than twice as much as those not nurtured. In August, the district party committee organized representatives from various cooperatives to visit the construction team's project, summarizing experiences from various aspects, and studying the mountain area construction plan. Since then, the larger agricultural cooperatives in the district have successively established basic construction teams.

How to Divide Labor

After the construction teams were established, the first problem encountered was the division of labor with general production teams in basic construction. Which construction tasks are the responsibility of the construction team? Which construction tasks are the responsibility of the production team? After research by various cooperatives, it has now been determined that afforestation and forestry in large and remote mountains, soil and water conservation projects with strong technical requirements, and demonstration projects are the responsibility of the construction team, while general afforestation, nurturing, and basic farmland construction are the responsibility of the production team. As for large-scale afforestation, it is still carried out by all cooperative members. It has also been determined that the organization of the construction team is long-term, and under normal circumstances, it will carry out basic construction year-round. During the busy farming season, it can support other production teams, but the organization cannot be dismantled. Therefore, the members participating in the construction team have long-term plans and are enthusiastic about learning technology and doing a good job in mountain area construction.

How to Remunerate

How to solve the issue of labor compensation for soil and water conservation work? The members of Heping Cooperative's construction team raised this question after working for three days. Participating in the construction team involves heavy work, tool wear, shoe wear, and more food consumption. Everyone disagreed with recording work points and receiving compensation in the same way as general production teams. After repeated discussions, a solution was found: Equal labor participating in the construction team should be recorded two work points more per day than participating in general production teams. The Hongda Agricultural Cooperative's construction team only records one more work point per day. Regarding the issue of tool damage, it is stipulated that the cooperative will appropriately subsidize the additional damage beyond that of general production teams. The labor work points of the construction team will participate in the year's income distribution. After this solution, everyone was very satisfied.

Three Organizational Forms

There are three organizational forms of construction teams: One is represented by the Heping Agricultural Cooperative. This cooperative is a joint cooperative composed of eleven independent accounting branches. The construction team is formed by drawing people from each branch, directly led by the larger cooperative, and specializes in basic construction outside the management scope of each branch. This is beneficial for completing major construction projects in a planned manner, but there are also some contradictions. For example, some branches are unwilling to send people to participate in the larger cooperative's construction team in order to carry out basic construction in their own areas. The construction team has no income of its own (because these are all long-term construction projects), and the labor compensation of the team members must be paid by each branch. Because some branches have more income and some branches have less income, the value of labor work points is different, and it is difficult to unify the amount of money contributed by each branch. To solve this problem, the Heping Cooperative adopted the method of having the construction team members participate in the income distribution of their own branch. Although this is better, there are still opinions between the members of each branch and the members of the construction team. The second is represented by the Mingshui Township Agricultural Cooperative, which is a joint cooperative with independent accounting for each branch. Each branch establishes a basic construction team. The construction teams are uniformly led by the larger cooperative in terms of construction plans and construction technology. Except for important construction tasks, when the construction team is temporarily concentrated and used by the larger cooperative, they generally carry out basic construction within their respective branches, and the recording of work points and compensation are the responsibility of each branch. The third is represented by the Wangjiadian Agricultural Cooperative, with the construction team established at the cooperative level. The construction team and other production teams are fraternal relations, uniformly led by the cooperative, and tasks, recording of work points, and compensation are all uniformly arranged by the cooperative. Compared with these three forms, the second and third forms are better, and the problems of tasks, recording of work points, and compensation for the construction team are easier to solve.

Three Major Benefits

The experience of this district proves that establishing basic construction teams at the cooperative level has three major benefits:

First, the construction team can play a backbone role, a shock force role, and a demonstration role in the basic construction work of mountainous areas. To transform mountainous areas and build mountainous areas, it is not only necessary to have grand plans, but also to have a strong force. The establishment of a year-round basic construction team can form a strong mountain area construction team, greatly promoting the development of mountain area construction.

Second, because the basic construction team is a professional production team, it can promote members to work hard to learn technology and delve into technology. Therefore, they are much faster than ordinary cooperative members in accepting basic construction technology. In this way, not only will the quality of basic construction be greatly improved, but also the technical guidance department will have a reliable basis for imparting technology to the masses. Through the construction team, the technology for carrying out basic construction can be quickly passed on to the masses and take root in the masses. This will play a great role in comprehensively improving the quality of basic construction.

Third, with a professional construction team, agricultural cooperatives can combine current production with long-term construction when planning production, and carry out basic construction in a planned and regular manner. Every time the agricultural cooperative discusses the tasks of the entire cooperative, it lists basic construction as one item. Sometimes, if it is neglected, the construction team will raise opinions, just as many cadres and the masses say: "Someone is speaking for the mountains."

    怎样组织山区基本建设队
    张延杰
    辽宁省绥中县时杖子区是山区，全区九个乡四十七个农业社只有耕地四千四百四十七公顷，而且绝大部分是梯田和坡田。为了加强山区的建设，1957年春季多数农业社都成立了基本建设队。全区有三十二个队、八百二十二人。这些队对山区建设起了很大的作用。
    1957年5月，秋子沟乡和平农业社首先成立了一个基本建设队，专门进行造林、育林和水土保持工作。这个社把老坟山（面积约一百公顷），作为水土保持的试点。这个山原有四千五百棵苹果树，是1956年栽的，由于栽后无人管理，发育很坏，枝瘦叶黄，有的即将枯死。经过基本建设队锄草，整枝，追肥，很快由枝瘦叶黄变成了枝壮叶茂。建设队在山区挖的卧牛坑和撩壕，都经住了当年大雨的考验，使雨水没有下山。这个事实大大教育了群众。经过基本建设队扶育的新林幼苗，也比不扶育的多长一倍多。8月区委组织各社的代表参观了这个建设队的工程，总结了各方面的经验，研究了山区建设规划。从此全区较大的农业社都先后成立了基本建设队。
    如何分工
    建设队成立后，遇到的头一个问题，就是和一般生产队在基本建设上的分工问题。哪些建设任务由建设队负责？哪些建设任务由生产队负责？经过各个社的研究，现已确定：大山、远山的造林、育林和技术性较强的水土保持工程以及试范工程由建设队负责，一般的造林、扶育和农田的基本建设由生产队负责。至于大面积的造林，仍由全体社员去作。并确定：建设队的组织是长期的，在一般情况下，它要常年进行基本建设。农忙时可支援其他生产队，但不能拆散组织。因此，参加建设队的社员都有了长期打算，都有了学习技术、搞好山区建设的热情。
    如何计酬
    水土保持工作的劳动报酬如何解决？和平社的建设队干了三天，社员就提出了这个问题。参加建设队活重，费工具，费鞋，吃饭多。大家都不同意和一般生产队一样记工，一样取报酬。经过反复讨论，找出了一个办法：同等劳动力参加建设队的要比参加一般生产队的每天多记二分工。红大农业社的建设队每天只多记一分。关于工具损坏问题，规定：超出一般生产队额外的损坏部分由社适当补贴。建设队的劳动工分参加当年的收益分配。这样解决后，大家都很满意。
    三种组织形式
    建设队的组织形式有三种：一种是以和平农业社为代表，这个社是由十一个自负盈亏的分社组成的联合社。建设队由各分社抽人组成，由大社直接领导，专门进行各分社管理范围以外的基本建设。这对有计划地完成大项建设有好处，但是也有些矛盾。例如有的分社为了进行自己地区的基本建设，不愿派人参加大社的建设队。建设队没有自己的收入（因为都是长年建设工程），队员的劳动报酬必须由各分社付出；由于有的分社收入多，有的分社收入少，劳动工分价值不同，各社交出的钱数也很难一致。和平社为了解决这个问题，采取了建设队的队员到自己的分社参加收益分配。这样作虽然好些，但各分社社员和建设队队员之间仍有意见。第二种以明水乡农业社为代表，这是一个由各分社自负盈亏的联合社。由各分社成立基本建设队。建设队在建设计划和建设技术方面由大社统一领导，除了有重要建设任务，建设队由大社临时集中使用外，一般的都在各分社内进行基本建设，记工和报酬都由各分社负责解决。第三种是以王家店农业社为代表，以社为单位成立的建设队。建设队和其他生产队是兄弟关系，由社统一领导，任务、记工和报酬等都由本社统一安排。这三种形式比较起来，第二种和第三种较好，建设队的任务、记工和报酬问题都容易解决。
    三大好处
    这个区的经验证明：以社为单位成立基本建设队，有三大好处：
    第一、建设队在山区的基本建设工作中，可以起骨干作用、突击作用和示范作用。要改造山区，建设山区，不仅要有宏大的计划，而且必须有一支强大的力量。建立常年基本建设队，就可以形成一支强大的山区建设队伍，大大促进山区建设的开展。
    第二、由于基本建设队是一个专业性生产队，可以推动队员努力学习技术，钻研技术。因此他们在接受基本建设的技术上比一般社员快的多。这样，不仅会大大提高基本建设的质量，而且也使技术指导部门在向群众传授技术的工作上有了依靠。经过建设队可以把进行基本建设的技术很快传给群众，在群众中扎根。这对全面提高基本建设的质量将起很大作用。
    第三、有了专业的建设队，农业社在规划生产时，就可以把当前生产和长远建设结合起来，有计划地、经常地进行基本建设。农业合作社每次讨论全社的任务时，都把基本建设列为一项，有时候疏忽了，建设队就提出意见，正如很多干部和群众所说的：“有人替山说话了”。
