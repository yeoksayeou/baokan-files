    **Pit Planting of Sweet Potatoes**

    The Xingguang Cooperative in Shehong County, Sichuan Province, has three main experiences in planting sweet potatoes in pits: First, deep plowing and deep digging, and early planting. The sweet potato land is first deeply plowed with a set plow, then finely tilled and leveled, and pits are dug for planting. The planting season is the "Spring Equinox," with 200 jin of seeds planted per mu. When planting, the sweet potato blocks are first allowed to sprout shallowly. They can emerge from the soil in about ten days, and the seedlings grow quickly. Second, apply more base fertilizer and separate fertilizer from the seeds. After the land is prepared, open sweet potato beds that are 2.8 feet square and 6-7 inches high. Dig narrow and deep ditches around the sweet potato beds, with a flat bottom inside. Dig a pit one foot in diameter and 1.2 feet deep on the bottom. Apply about 50 jin of fertilizer in the pit, including one ladle of human and animal manure, one jin of phosphate rock powder, and some green manure. After the moisture dries, fill the pit with soil, then dig a shallow pit in the middle of the pit, and plant a sweet potato seed. The sweet potato seed should be inserted upright in the pit, with the sprouts facing upwards, and care should be taken to prevent the sweet potato seed from contacting the fertilizer, to prevent the fertilizer in the pit from becoming too hot after fermentation, which will affect the growth of the sweet potato sprouts. After planting, cover the sweet potato seeds with fine mud to prevent water from accumulating in the pit. Third, densely plant at a high density and press the vines in time. About 765 pits are dug per mu for pit sweet potatoes. When the sweet potato vines grow to 1.1-1.2 feet, start pressing the vines. When pressing the vines, dig small ditches 2-3 inches deep at the four corners around the sweet potato pit, and press one vine in each ditch. The method of pressing the vines is to tightly press 3-6 nodes with fine mud three inches away from the root of the vine, without breaking the vine. The sweet potato leaves should be exposed outside the soil. Each pit can press 8-10 vines, so each mu is actually equivalent to planting 6,000 to 7,000 pits. In the autumn, each pit will bear sweet potatoes, and some pits can produce more than 30 jin.
    Planting sweet potatoes in pits requires a large amount of seeds.

    **Sugarcane**

    Sugarcane is the main raw material for sugar production. In the process of sugarcane processing, it can also produce molasses equivalent to 3% of the stem weight. Molasses is the raw material for the alcohol industry, and can also be made into yeast tablets and organic acids such as caramel, acetic acid, butyric acid, and succinic acid, and alcohols and ketones such as butanol and acetone. The bagasse left over from sugar production can be made into bagasse board, which is a good building material. Bagasse can also be made into pulp and used as raw materials for rayon, furfural, bakelite, and electrical materials. At the same time, bagasse can be made into compost, used as fuel, and can be ground and stored to feed pigs.

    窝子苕
    四川射洪县星光社，栽窝子苕的主要经验有三条：第一，深耕深挖，提早下种。红苕地先用套犁深耕，然后整细耙平，开窝下种。下种的时令是“春分”，每亩下种两百斤。播种时，先使苕块发出浅芽，放种后十多天就可出土，苗子生长很快。第二，多施底肥，粪、种隔离。地整好后，开二尺八寸见方和高六、七寸的红苕厢。苕厢四周开又窄又深的沟，厢内是平底，底上挖直径一尺，深一尺二寸的窝，窝内施肥五十斤左右，包括一瓜瓢人畜粪、一斤磷矿粉及若干绿肥，待水分干后，用土把窝填平，再在窝中间挖一浅窝，下苕种一根。苕种要直立插在窝中，芽子向上，并注意不使苕种和肥料接触，以防窝内肥料腐熟后发热过高，影响苕芽生长。下种以后，在红苕种上盖细泥巴，以防窝内积水。第三，高度密植，及时压藤。窝子苕每亩地大约挖七百六十五窝，等苕藤长至一尺一二寸以后开始压藤，压藤时在苕窝周围四角，各挖二、三寸深的小沟，每沟压一根藤。压藤的方法是，在离藤根三寸远的地方，用细泥紧压三至六个节巴，不能压破藤麻。红苕叶子要露在土外，每窝可压藤八到十根，这样每亩实际上等于种了六千到七千多窝，秋后每窝都结红苕，有的一窝可产三十多斤。
    栽窝子苕用种量较大。
    甘蔗
    甘蔗是制糖的主要原料。在甘蔗加工的过程中，还能生产相当于茎重3％的糖蜜。糖蜜是酒精工业的原料，还可制成酵母片和焦糖、醋酸、酪酸、琥珀酸等有机酸和丁醇、丙酮等醇酮类。制糖剩下的蔗渣，可以制成蔗板，是良好的建筑材料。蔗渣还可制成纸浆，和作为人造丝、糖醛、电木和电料等的原料。同时，蔗渣可以制堆肥、作燃料，磨细储存起来可以喂猪。
