    The State-owned Harbin Boiler Factory recently successfully trial-produced a multi-layer high-pressure vessel test cylinder. This marks that the factory has mastered the manufacturing technology of important chemical equipment - high-pressure vessels.
    High-pressure vessels are key equipment for manufacturing synthetic chemical plants such as nitrogen fertilizer and nylon. It needs to be wrapped and welded into a thick cylinder with more than twenty layers of thin steel plates. The technical requirements are very high, and the anti-explosion pressure must reach 320 kilograms per square centimeter. This year, the factory will manufacture seven items totaling twenty-four high-pressure vessels for chemical fertilizer plants in Jilin, Dalian, Nanjing and other locations.

    重要的化工设备
    国营哈尔滨锅炉厂最近试制成功多层高压容器试验筒。这标志着这个工厂已经掌握了重要化工设备——高压容器的制造技术。
    高压容器是制造氮肥、尼龙等合成化学工厂的关键设备。它要用二十多层薄钢板包扎焊成厚筒。技术要求很高，抗爆压力每平方公分要达到三百二十公斤。这个工厂今年要为吉林、大连、南京等化学肥料厂制造七项二十四台高压容器。
