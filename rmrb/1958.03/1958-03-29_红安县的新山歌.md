Song of Progress

    Editor's Note: In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in the rural areas across the country, countless new folk songs have emerged. They sing of the earth-shaking revolutionary vigor of socialist peasants and the rising tide of new heroic figures, demonstrating the magnificent spirit of the Chinese people in building socialism. Many of them are good poems that combine realism and romanticism. Today, we are publishing these new folk songs from Hong'an County and other recently published new folk songs with the aim of recommending them to readers. The new folk songs of Hong'an County are selected from "Poems in the Leap Forward" compiled and printed by the Propaganda Department of the Hong'an County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. This kind of collection and compilation work is very meaningful. We hope that the propaganda departments and poetry workers in various regions will pay attention to this vast new "national style" and do more "folk song collecting" work.
    Folk Song Medley [Chorus]
    The earth returns to spring with beautiful scenery,
    Men and women, old and young, are busy with production,
    Singing folk songs to promote the Great Leap Forward,
    Everyone joins in with the tune.
    [Kaihuang Township commune members sing]
    Revolutionary cradle, Kaihuang Township,
    Heroic people with high morale.
    Past struggles are for today,
    Today we should preserve the glory even more,
    Everyone is strong in production.
    [Yangshan Township commune members sing]
    The Agricultural Program is a guiding light,
    Guiding us in production,
    Diversified operations with great development,
    Yielding a thousand catties of grain and oil per mu,
    The mountainous area is renewed every day.
    [Dai Zengjun, Lu Yanqing sing]
    A new atmosphere in the countryside,
    Field ridges and land edges are clean and bright;
    The wheat seedlings in the fields are green and tender;
    The "six haves" construction is all over the villages,
    Production songs are sung everywhere.
    [Liu Xiansheng sings]
    Entering the countryside, a great change!
    Houses are whitewashed uniformly;
    Environmental sanitation is done well;
    Eliminate the four pests together,
    Everyone is healthy and production is strong.
    [Ruan Chengdong sings]
    Thousands of years of mountain water flow downwards,
    Never turning back until it reaches the bottom,
    Mountain floods burst and field banks collapse,
    A piece of good land turns into a sandbar,
    All kinds of crops are lost.
    The Party leads in repairing water conservancy,
    Mountain floods no longer flow randomly from now on,
    Drought and flood disasters are no longer a worry,
    The sandbar is still turned into good land,
    Turning things around for a permanent harvest.
    [Taohua Township commune members sing]
    Everyone praises the production plan:
    Green trees provide shade, magpies chirp;
    A thousand catties of grain are produced in the fields;
    White cotton flowers bloom in the fields;
    The faces of "Taohua" people resemble peach blossoms.
    [Jiansu Cooperative members sing]
    Good news is reported after the autumn harvest,
    Rice in the fields resembles gold;
    Peanuts in the fields are all increased in production;
    Pigs in the pens are so lovable;
    Happy life is rising up.
    [Agricultural Cooperative accountant sings]
    Opening the old accounts and looking at the new accounts,
    This year's income has changed greatly,
    Financial work must be done well,
    Daily and monthly settlements must not be forgotten,
    Diligence and thrift in running the cooperative must be kept in mind.
    [Rural cadres sing]
    Study diligently and practice hard with determination,
    Innovate and experiment to produce,
    Overall leadership for the Great Leap Forward,
    Achieve double thousand catties of grain and oil,
    Strive to build a new countryside.
    [Financial and economic cadres sing]
    Not afraid of the summer heat and scorching days,
    Not afraid of the wind, snow, and bone-chilling cold,
    Not afraid of the high mountains and distant roads,
    Delivering goods to the four townships,
    Supporting the Great Leap Forward without fear of difficulties.
    [Chorus]
    The whole county mobilizes,
    Striving to build a new Hong'an,
    Hard work for three years to several years,
    The face of Hong'an has greatly changed:
    Everywhere there are rice and grain fields,
    Distant and nearby mountains are fruit and flower mountains;
    Silkworms spin silk and bees make honey,
    Trees bear oil and pigs fill the pens,
    Cattle and sheep graze in flocks on the mountains,
    Chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits are everywhere,
    Roadsides and houses are greened,
    Fish swim happily in the ponds and dikes,
    Every family has ample food and clothing,
    Everyone is literate and happy,
    The four pests are completely eliminated,
    People's faces are as fresh as peach blossoms,
    The Communist Party's good leadership,
    Socialism for ten thousand years.
    See Who is the Hero (Gaofeng Township)
    Conquering nature in the Great Leap Forward,
    Technical innovation as vanguards,
    The action of water dripping through stone,
    The determination of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains,
    Flying a thousand miles a day, not stopping for half a moment,
    Working hard through ice and snow, not fearing wind and rain,
    Moving forward together, see who is the model.
    Gongqing Reservoir (Xinghua Township)
    Gongqing Reservoir is built by youth,
    Young people show their skills on the construction site,
    Mountain gorge water gate engineering is great,
    Storing water to irrigate the fields and hills.
    Working hard with the stars and moon,
    Daring to change nature first,
    Determined to eliminate drought,
    To turn high mountains into fertile fields.
    From now on, no longer afraid of drought,
    Guaranteeing a good harvest is not difficult;
    Golden rice paddies shimmer in the fields,
    Crop harvests are colorful,
    Peach blossoms and green willows reflect on the water,
    Camellia fragrance fills the mountains,
    Silver fish are raised in the reservoir,
    Pairs of mandarin ducks play on the water.
    Township-wide Motorization (Dianming Township)
    For the double thousand catties, a great tool innovation,
    Everyone comes up with ideas, everyone contributes,
    One idea saves a hundred strengths.
    Every family is a factory, everyone is a technician,
    Tools are improved, labor efficiency is high,
    A good harvest is more reliable.
    Teams repair roads, mountain depressions are also accessible to vehicles,
    Township-wide motorization, eliminating shoulder carrying,
    Everyone is happy.
    Breaking Through the Thousand Catty Barrier (Yuanhe Township)
    Cadres and the masses have strong bones, determined to engage in the Great Leap Forward,
    The weather is cold but people are not cold, freezing feet but not freezing hearts,
    Charging forward like a horse, achieving double thousand catties.
    Once at Xinjian, seedlings are in the fields,
    Rape plants are large, wheat looks really good,
    Really like the Leap Forward, a good harvest is in sight.
    Old Revolutionary (Yangshan Township)
    Old revolutionary, heroic man,
    In the past, killing enemies charged to the front.
    Leading the Great Leap Forward in production,
    Better than youth and adults,
    Plowing paddy fields without fear of wind and cold,
    Taking off shoes and socks and going into the fields first.
    Everywhere like an old predecessor,
    Truly worthy of being a heroic man.

    红安县的新山歌
    编者按：在全国农村的大跃进高潮中，出现了无数的新山歌。它们歌唱了社会主义农民的移山倒海的革命干劲和风起云涌的新英雄人物，显示了中国人民建设社会主义的磅礴气概。其中有不少是现实主义和浪漫主义相结合的好诗。今天我们在这里发表的红安县的新山歌和最近发表了其他新山歌，目的就是向读者作推荐。红安县新山歌，选自中共红安县委宣传部编印的“跃进中的诗歌”。这种搜集、编印工作是很有意义的。我们希望各地宣传工作部门和诗歌工作者们对这浩如烟海的新“国风”加以重视，多多去做“采风”工作。
