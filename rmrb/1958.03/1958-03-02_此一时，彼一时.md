    Different Times, Different Circumstances
    What is the situation of France in the Algerian War?
    Guy Mollet, on January 22, patted his chest in the National Assembly and said that the military problem there was "virtually solved" and that the remaining "riots" would soon "subside."
    The Army Committee of the French National Assembly, in a recent report, said that the problem there was serious and that military strength needed to be increased. Long-term efforts are required.
    Why did the French government give contradictory answers to the same question? Is it because there is a difference of opinion between Guy Mollet and the Army Committee, or because the situation in Algeria has fundamentally changed in the past month?
    The reason is not these, but "different times, different circumstances." Guy Mollet spoke about this issue when French colonial policy was being strongly condemned, so he closed his eyes and talked nonsense, exaggerating the "achievements of the pacification campaign" as a defense. The Army Committee spoke about this issue when the French National Assembly was about to discuss the 1958 military budget, and it was necessary to explain why the cost of the war in Algeria was increasing; it was clearly impossible not to admit the truth.

    此一时，彼一时
    法国在阿尔及利亚战争中的处境如何呢？
    盖伊阿1月22日在国民议会里拍着胸脯说：那里的军事问题“实际上已经解决了”，剩下的一些“暴乱”也将很快“消沉下去”。
    法国国民议会的陆军委员会在最近提出的一个报告里却说：那里的问题严重，还需要增强军事力量。作出长期努力才行。
    为什么对于同一个问题，法国的官方作出了相反的答复呢？是因为在盖伊阿和陆军委员会之间有着分歧的意见，还是因为一个月来阿尔及利亚的战局有了根本的变化？
    原因不是这些，而是“此一时，彼一时也”。盖伊阿谈起这个问题是在法国殖民政策受到强烈谴责的时候，因此他就闭起眼睛说瞎话，把“绥靖行动的成就”胡吹一通来作为辩解。而陆军委员会谈起这个问题是在法国国民议会正要讨论1958年度军事预算的时候，要说明为什么在阿尔及利亚的战争费用越来越大，再不承认事实的真相显然是不行了。
