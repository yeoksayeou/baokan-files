Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 29th: Medan Radio broadcast on the evening of the 28th that Lieutenant Maha, press officer of the Indonesian First Military District, announced that Indonesian government forces had basically driven the Nainggolan rebels out of eastern North Sumatra. He added that the remnants of the Nainggolan rebels now number less than three hundred, and their morale is very low. They are encountering many difficulties and are continuing to flee.

Part of the Nainggolan rebels, who attempted to occupy Medan unsuccessfully, fled southwest to Bulahaba on the shores of Lake Toba, and government forces are pursuing them. Government forces recently also recovered Samosir Island on Lake Toba.

According to Antara News Agency, another part of Nainggolan's rebels has fled to the Tapanoeli area on the west coast. When asked by reporters whether these rebels would be pursued all the way to the border of the Tapanoeli area, First Military District Commander Gingtings said that he had received orders from the Army Chief of Staff to continue to eliminate rebels throughout the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 29th: According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff Subiyakto said on the 28th that the Indonesian Navy's blockade of the rebel areas had been successful. He said that no ships leaving ports controlled by the rebels were able to evade interception by naval vessels.

In response to questions, Subiyakto also said that the Navy had almost completely stopped illegal smuggling activities, especially the smuggling activities of the Central Sumatra rebel group. (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚政府军乘胜追击
    北苏门答腊叛军无处立脚东逃西窜
    新华社雅加达29日电　据棉兰电台在28日晚间广播：印度尼西亚第一军区新闻发布官马哈中尉宣布，印度尼西亚政府军队已经基本上把奈恩戈兰叛军赶出北苏门答腊东部。他还说，奈恩戈兰叛军残部现在已经不到三百人，而且士气非常低落。他们遭遇到很多困难，并且正在继续逃窜。
    企图占领棉兰未遂的奈恩戈兰叛军中的一部分向棉兰西南多巴湖畔的不拉八逃窜，政府军正在跟踪追击。政府军在不久以前还收复了多巴湖上的散摩西尔岛。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，奈恩戈兰的另一部分叛军已经逃往西海岸的打板奴里地区。第一军区司令京廷斯在回答记者提出的关于这股叛军是否将一直被追击到打板奴里地区边境的问题时说，他已经接到陆军参谋长的命令，要继续肃清全国各地的叛军。
    新华社雅加达29日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚海军参谋长苏比雅克托在28日说，印度尼西亚海军对叛乱地区进行的封锁获得了成功。他说，从叛军控制下的港口驶出的船只，没有一艘能够躲过海军舰船的拦截。
    苏比雅克托在回答问题时还说，海军已经差不多完全制止了非法走私活动，特别是中苏门答腊叛乱集团的走私活动。（附图片）
