    Notes

    Confessing Without Being Forced
    Iran uncovered a conspiracy, aided by a foreign country, to overthrow the government. The Iranian government did not specify the name of this foreign country in its official announcement, but a U.S. State Department spokesperson rushed to declare that it knew nothing about the conspiracy. The U.S. State Department's ugly behavior is truly, as the saying goes, "A guilty conscience needs no accuser."
    After the State Department spokesperson made the above statement, diplomatic figures in Washington immediately chimed in, saying that in that region of the world, it is common practice to blame unnamed foreign governments for alleged conspiracies. This diplomatic figure in Washington is indeed adept at handling such matters, even counter-attacking as if the Iranian government had wrongly accused the United States, this foreign government. However, this only further exposed the thieving face of the United States. Because if it really had nothing to do with it, why would even non-official diplomatic figures in Washington be so anxious to defend the United States?

    不打自招
    伊朗破获了一件在外国的帮助下企图推翻政府的阴谋案件。伊朗政府在公报中没有指明这个外国的名字，但是美国国务院的发言人却赶忙声明说，关于这个阴谋案件，它什么也不知道。美国国务院的这种丑态，真如俗话所说的是：“贼人心虚，不打自招”。
    在国务院发言人作了上述声明之后，华盛顿的外交界人士立刻帮腔说，在世界的那一地区，把传说中的阴谋归罪于没有指名的外国政府是司空见惯的事。华盛顿的这个外交界人士不愧是应付这类事情的能手，他竟然能够反咬一口，好像是伊朗政府冤枉了美国这个外国政府。可是，这一来却更暴露了美国贼人的嘴脸。因为如果真的事不关己，为什么连并非官方身份的华盛顿的外交界人士也这样性急地替美国辩解呢。
