Everyone Has Culture, Everywhere is the Sound of Reading
Introduction to the Experience of Dengfeng County, Henan Province in Eliminating Illiteracy

Dengfeng County is located at the foot of Mount Song. For generations, the people have lived a life of suffering due to “thick stone and thin soil, nine droughts in ten years” and “no three miles of flat land, not a penny for the people.” The working people of this county were all "illiterate" "staring blind," and were called "mountain hicks" and "blockheads" by the landlord class.

Under the situation of the nationwide socialist great leap forward, the anti-illiteracy campaign in Dengfeng County has also developed one upsurge after another. The great leap forward in anti-illiteracy work has greatly changed the spiritual outlook of the rural areas of this county. Now, out of the 84,325 illiterates in the county, 68,516 have passed the exam, accounting for 81.2%, successfully completing the historical task that has not been completed for thousands of years. There are also 15,809 illiterates who are working day and night to study intensively, and they are determined to eliminate all illiteracy by the end of March. Old lady Ding Xiuzhen said: "Chiang Kai-shek made good eyes turn blind, and Chairman Mao made blind people have good eyes. I am determined to send my children and daughter-in-law to school to learn culture." Wang Fen, a widow in Shilibu who takes care of her mother-in-law with three children, wrote on the door couplets: "Borrow the starlight to accumulate fertilizer and deliver manure, and take advantage of the moonlight to read and write", the horizontal inscription is "Vision is Higher." Lei Chunsheng of Jingwan Township wrote on the door couplets: "Only by listening to Chairman Mao's words can we embark on socialism," the horizontal inscription is "Don't be Illiterate." In Sanguanmiao Township, which originally had only 21 literate people, in addition to public primary schools, there are now 13 amateur higher primary school classes, 9 junior middle school classes, 2 senior middle school classes, and a cadre Red and Expert school run by the township and commune. All 416 agricultural cooperatives and 1,968 production teams in the county have established farmer amateur schools in every team and village, with 920 higher primary school classes, 99 junior middle school classes, 7 senior middle school classes, 12 Red and Expert schools, and 12 technical research groups. 45,000 people in the county have participated in amateur primary school classes, and 23,000 people have participated in technical classes. Fan Yukun, a graduate of Sanguanmiao Township's anti-illiteracy campaign, studied the junior high school plant course and used Michurin's theory to successfully experiment with vernalized wheat, eggplant grafted peppers, sweet potato warm soup seedling raising, and corn artificial pollination to increase yields. Fan Hailiang, a farmer writer in this township, can already write novels and poems. He wrote in a poem "Ode to Chairman Mao": "Chairman Mao's eyes are like two stars, and people living in the mountains have also seen your light"!

What are Dengfeng's experiences in eliminating illiteracy?

I. The Party Committee has strengthened its leadership over the anti-illiteracy work, clarifying that the anti-illiteracy work is a preparation and indispensable step for learning culture, studying science, and improving technology, and it serves socialist production and construction. When the anti-illiteracy work can be combined with production and serve production, the anti-illiteracy work will be welcomed and supported by the masses, and the movement can be carried out extensively, deeply, and rapidly. In the past, there was a period when some people mistakenly emphasized the anti-illiteracy work to an inappropriate position, demanding to squeeze time and compete for time with production, and excessively emphasizing formal classroom learning; when production work and the central work of a certain period were busy, the anti-illiteracy work was squeezed out. Dengfeng found a way to solve this contradiction in practice, stipulating the three-level leadership system of "township leadership, commune-run schools, and team guarantees" and the seven unified leadership methods (unified planning, unified deployment, unified organization, unified action, unified inspection, unified reporting, and unified summary and evaluation). Party members, League members, commune and team cadres, and cadres' families all took the lead in participating in the study, and the learning upsurge could be quickly set off. In order to better squeeze out study time and effectively promote the work, cultural learning was conducted first during meeting and assembly times, and then commune and team cadres and folk school teachers exchanged positions. The cadres sitting in the students' seats went to the podium to deploy production tasks, and the teachers sat in the students' seats to listen to reports and take notes; and political mobilization work was carried out during the production process. When allocating productive forces, unified planning was also made for folk school teachers according to changes in production tasks, so that learning would not be affected by changes in production organization. They also combined the characteristics of production and put forward slogans such as "hands do not leave books, books do not leave hands," "blackboards go to the fields, books go to the slopes," and "production takes the lead, learning strives for models." The educational work that production and learning must be closely combined has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, turning production rest time into reading and newspaper time. The masses in Kuzhuang Township said: "In the past, when production rested, young people would fight and make noise, but now they are reading and newspapers." Close combination of production and learning is the primary key to doing a good job in eliminating illiteracy.

The second is to constantly criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, do a good job in ideological mobilization, and boldly support advanced experiences. The right-leaning conservative ideas that generally exist in anti-illiteracy work are: not believing that anti-illiteracy work can make a leap forward, not believing in the leadership of the Party and the strength of the masses, not believing that anti-illiteracy work can promote production, and not believing that adults and women with many children and heavy housework can eliminate illiteracy. In order to break these ideological obstacles, the county party secretary personally presided over the summary of the advanced experiences of anti-illiteracy in "seven communes, six villages, and fourteen teams", and convened a folk school teacher oath meeting and a cadre symposium focusing on anti-illiteracy. When the Second District put forward the slogan of "a thousand people teach, ten thousand people learn", the county party committee promptly summarized and developed this slogan into the slogan of "ten thousand people teach, the whole people learn", which is a leadership method that adapts to the upsurge situation. During the cooperativeization upsurge, comparisons between the new and old societies were widely carried out among the masses, complaining about the suffering of not having culture. On the basis of this ideological mobilization, the "ten thousand people teach, the whole people learn" campaign was launched and combined with the study of the agricultural development program to carry out debates. Questions such as "Do we need culture to realize four, five, and eight ahead of schedule" and "How can anti-illiteracy work be combined with the center and serve production" were raised, and large-scale airing of views and debates were carried out to conduct more extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization. On the basis of unified ideological understanding, district, township, and commune party organizations convened mass oath meetings at each level, establishing confidence and determination to march towards culture. When a climax of learning by all the people has been formed, it is also stipulated that: celebrate a team, a commune, and a township when a team, a commune, and a township are completed; celebrate a district when a district is completed. Model Fan Yukun, Cheng Fengying, Cui Qiuying, etc., who studied hard and practiced hard, were organized to broadcast to the whole county, setting off a climax of hard study and practice and teaching, with "men catch up with Fan Yukun, women catch up with Cheng Fengying", "determined to fight hard for a month, eliminate illiteracy before the Spring Festival", and "for the sake of a cultural county, the Spring Festival will not stop the war". These two climaxes intertwined and formed a surging torrent, sweeping away all conservative ideas. Teachers in Kuzhuang Township only proposed to guarantee the graduation of 20 people before the Spring Festival at the oath meeting and were not confident enough. 259 people graduated before the Spring Festival. While announcing the "illiteracy-free county", the county party committee convened a cultural promotion meeting of district and township cadres and backbone folk school teachers. Through visiting the teaching of amateur primary schools and amateur middle schools in Jietou Township, Sanguanmiao Township introduced the experience of popularizing comprehensive amateur schools and cadre Red and Expert schools, as well as establishing technical research groups, criticized the complacent mood of "learning to the top", and put forward new tasks and new measures. A new upsurge of learning was launched throughout the county to march towards eliminating cultural illiteracy and scientific illiteracy.

The third is to rectify the anti-illiteracy association, grasp the leadership of teaching, and launch a teaching upsurge of "ten thousand people teach, the whole people learn". The deputy secretary of the branch and the deputy township head, deputy commune head, and deputy team leader of the township and commune must include running folk schools in their work schedule, be responsible for solving the work of teachers, classrooms, teaching materials, and mobilizing and organizing students, and must take the lead in participating in the corresponding classes according to their own cultural level. In order to extensively and deeply mobilize the enthusiasm of folk school teachers and young teachers who teach and guarantee teaching, the Fourth District put forward a vivid slogan "Industrialization relies on workers, agricultural increase relies on farmers, and cultural revolution is handed over to literate people". This slogan was quickly promoted throughout the county, and debates were launched on where the knowledge of literate people comes from, what responsibilities literate people should bear for building socialism, and whether literate people should shine brightly in the anti-illiteracy campaign, criticizing "rather manage thousands of troops than teach farmers", "seventy-two lines, not doing anti-illiteracy" and other wrong ideas and remarks. They mobilized literate people from all aspects to participate in the anti-illiteracy work, with more than 1,000 cadres sent to lower levels and demobilized soldiers, more than 10,000 middle and high school graduates engaged in agricultural production, more than 20,000 middle and high school students studying in schools, and more than 30,000 people who graduated from previous anti-illiteracy campaigns before the Spring Festival, as well as 4,000 folk school teachers and full-time anti-illiteracy cadres with teaching experience, and more than 10,000 social intellectuals. Through the general training of folk school teachers and young teachers, their political awareness and teaching methods were improved, and a teaching upsurge of "ten thousand people teach, the whole people learn" and teaching and guaranteeing learning, mutual teaching and mutual learning was launched, and teaching transmission stations and teaching research groups were established. , prepare lessons on time, observe each other, and other systems, which greatly improved the quality of teaching. In addition, middle schools, primary schools, and township and commune anti-illiteracy associations respectively established teaching teams, divided regions and objects, and determined task requirements, which played a great role in helping and promoting both teaching parties, creating a teaching upsurge of "brother teachers, sisters-in-law teachers, everyone is a student, everyone is a teacher". In terms of teaching methods, the effective methods of "one book per month" small unit teaching method, homophone teaching method, small blackboard teaching, and village literacy post were also promoted, and "three fixings and three guarantees" were put forward in the teaching requirements (fixed folk school teachers, guarantee not to pull indiscriminately; fixed daily learning time, guarantee not to occupy casually; fixed teaching tasks, guarantee to reach quality). In terms of teaching methods, "ten changes" were put forward (① change folk schools into venues, learning does not affect meetings; ② change rest into learning, production and learning are both active; ③ learn what you do, learning content is everywhere; ④ students are propagandists, implement policies ahead of others; ⑤ learning follows production, production and learning are not lost; ⑥ production and learning are grasped together, organization and leadership are not separated; ⑦ anti-illiteracy associations play a role, there are young teachers everywhere; ⑧ create a good literacy environment; ⑨ construction sites become classrooms, learning culture keeps up; ⑩ serving the center combines production, all work takes precedence).

    河南登封县扫盲工作经验介绍
    登封县在嵩山脚下，人民世世代代过着“石厚土薄、十年九旱”，“地无三里平、人无一文铜”的痛苦生活，这个县的劳动人民都是“目不识丁”的“瞪眼瞎”，被地主阶级说成是“山憨子”，是“楞头青”。
    在全国社会主义大跃进的形势下，登封县的扫盲运动也一个高潮接着一个高潮地发展起来。扫盲工作大跃进使这个县农村的精神面貌大大改观。现在，全县八万四千三百二十五个扫盲对象中，有六万八千五百一十六人考试及格，占81.2％，胜利完成了数千年来未能完成的历史任务。还有一万五千八百零九个文盲正夜以继日地进行突击学习，他们决心要在三月底全部扫完。丁秀珍老大娘说：“蒋介石叫好眼变瞎子，毛主席叫瞎子变好眼，我决心送孩子媳妇上学，学文化”。十里铺带着三个孩子奉养着婆母的寡妇王芬在门联上写道：“借星光积肥送粪，趁月亮读书写字”，横额是“眼光高了”。井湾乡雷春生在门联上写着：“只有听毛主席话，才能走社会主义”，横额是“不当文盲”。原来只有二十一个识字人的三官庙乡，现在除设有公立完小外，新出现了乡、社办的业余高小十三班，初中九班，高中二班，干部红专学校一所。全县四百一十六个农业社，一千九百六十八个生产队，队队村村都办了农民业余学校，有高小九百二十班，初中九十九班，高中七班，红专学校十二所，还有十二个技术研究组。全县已有四万五千人参加了业余小学班学习，二万三千人参加了技术班学习。三官庙乡扫盲毕业的范玉坤学习了初中植物课程就运用米丘林学说，实验成功了春化小麦，天天茄嫁接辣椒，红芋温汤育苗，玉米人工授粉等作物，提高了产量。这个乡的农民作家范海亮已经会写小说和诗。他在“歌颂毛主席”的诗上这样写道：“毛主席的眼睛像两颗明星，住在山沟里的人们也看见了你的光明”！
    登封在扫盲工作上有哪些经验呢？
    一、党委加强了对扫盲工作的领导，明确了扫盲工作是学习文化、研究科学、提高技术的准备工作和不可缺少的步骤，是为社会主义的生产建设服务的。当扫盲工作能够结合生产、服务生产时，扫盲工作就能受到群众的欢迎，得到群众的支持，运动才能广泛深入和迅速的开展起来。过去有一个时期曾有人错误地把扫盲工作强调到不适当的地位，要和生产挤时间，争时间，过分强调正规的课堂学习；在生产工作和一定时期的中心工作繁忙时，扫盲工作就被挤掉了。登封在实践工作中找到了解决这个矛盾的方法，规定了“乡领导、社办学、队保证”的三级领导制度和七统一的领导方法（统一计划、统一布置、统一组织、统一行动、统一检查、统一汇报、统一总结评比），党团员社、队干部和干部家属都带头参加学习，学习高潮就能很快地掀起来。为了更好地挤出学习时间，并有效地推动工作，在开会集合时间先进行文化学习，接着社队干部和民校教师换位置，坐在学员座位上的干部到讲台上布置生产任务，教师就坐在学员座位上听报告、作记录；并在生产过程中进行政治鼓动工作。在调配生产力时，还根据生产任务变化，对民校教师也作统一规划，不使学习因生产组织变化而受到影响。他们还结合生产特点提出“手不离书、书不离手”，“黑板下地，书本上坡”，“生产打先锋，学习争模范”等口号，生产和学习必须密切结合的教育工作已经深入人心，把生产休息时间都变成了读书看报时间。库庄乡群众说：“过去生产休息时青年们打打闹闹，现在休息时都是读书看报”。生产和学习密切结合是搞好扫盲工作的首要关键。
    其次是不断地批判右倾保守思想，作好思想发动工作，大胆支持先进经验。扫盲工作中普遍存在着的右倾保守思想是：不相信扫盲工作能够跃进，不相信党的领导和群众的力量，不相信扫盲工作能够促进生产，不相信成年人和孩子多、家务重的妇女能够扫除文盲。为了打破这些思想障碍，县委书记曾亲自主持总结了“七社六村十四队”的扫盲先进经验，召开了民校教师誓师大会和扫盲重点的干部座谈会。当二区提出“千人教，万人学”的口号时，县委又及时总结，把这一口号发展成为“万人教，全民学”的口号，这是适应高潮形势的领导方法。合作化高潮时，在群众中普遍开展了新旧社会对比、诉没有文化的苦。在这个思想发动的基础上，又发动“万人教，全民学”和结合对农业发展纲要的学习，开展了辩论。提出：“提前实现四、五、八要不要文化”，“扫盲工作如何结合中心，服务生产”等问题，开展了大鸣大放、大辩论，更广泛深入地进行了思想发动。区、乡、社党组织又在思想认识统一基础上，逐级召开了群众性的誓师大会，树立了向文化大进军的信心和决心。在全民学习已经形成高潮时，又规定：完成一队、一社、一乡，就庆祝一队、一社、一乡；完成一区庆祝一区。组织苦学苦练模范范玉坤、程凤英、崔秋英等对全县广播，掀起了“男的赶上范玉坤、女的赶上程凤英”，“决心苦战一个月，扫除文盲过春节”，“为了文化县，春节不停战”的苦学苦练高潮和教学高潮。这两个高潮相互交织，形成了汹涌澎湃的巨流，扫除了一切保守思想。库庄乡教师在誓师大会上仅提出保证春节前毕业二十人还信心不足，春节前即毕业了二百五十九人。县委在宣布“无盲县”的同时，召开了区、乡干部和骨干民校教师的文化促进会议，通过参观介头乡的业余小学和业余中学的教学、三官庙乡介绍普及综合业余学校和干部红专学校，以及建立技术研究组的经验，批判了“学习到顶”的自满情绪，提出了新的任务和新的措施。又在全县范围内掀起了向扫文化盲、扫科学盲的大进军的学习热潮。
    其三是整顿扫盲协会，抓紧教学领导，发动“万人教，全民学”的教学高潮。支部的副支书和乡、社的副乡长、副社长、副队长必须把办好民校列为自己的工作日程，负责解决教师、教室、教具和学员动员组织工作，并要根据自己的文化水平，带头参加相应的班级学习。四区为了广泛深入发动民校教和包教的小先生的积极性，提出“工业化靠工人，农业增产靠农民，文化革命交给识字人”的生动口号，这一口号很快在全县范围内推广了起来，并开展了识字人的知识是从哪里来的，有文化的人对建设社会主义应该担负什么责任，有文化的人是否应该在扫盲运动中大放光芒的辩论，批判了“宁管千军，不教农民”，“七十二行，不干扫盲”等错误思想言论。他们调动各方面的识字人参加扫盲工作，有一千多下放干部和转业军人，一万多个从事农业生产的中、小学毕业生，二万多在学校学习的中、小学学生和在春节前历次扫盲毕业的三万多人，以及有教学经验的四千名民校教师、扫盲专职干部，还有社会知识分子一万多人。通过对民校教师和小先生的普训，提高了他们的政治觉悟和教学方法，开展了“万人教，全民学”和包教保学、互教互学的教学高潮，并建立了教学传授站，教学研究组，按时备课，互相观摩等制度，大大地提高了教学质量。此外，还由中、小学和乡、社扫盲协会分别建立了包教队伍，划分地区、对象，确定任务要求，对教学两方都起了很大的帮助和推动作用，造成了“兄弟教师，妯娌先生，人人是学生，人人是先生”的教学热潮。在教学方法上，还推广了“一月一本书”的小单元教法，同音字教学法，小黑板教学，村头识字岗等有效办法，以及在教学要求上提出“三固定三保证”（固定民校教师，保证不乱拉；固定每天学习时间，保证不随便侵占；固定教学任务，保证达到质量）。在教学办法上提出了“十变”（①变民校为会场，开会学习不影响；②变休息为学习，生产学习两积极；③作什么学什么，到处有学习内容；④学员就是宣传员，贯彻政策跑在前；⑤学习跟着生产走，生产学习两不丢；⑥生产学习一齐抓，组织领导不分家；⑦扫盲协会起作用，到处都是小先生；⑧造好良好的识字环境；⑨工地变课堂，学习文化紧跟上；⑩服务中心结合生产，样样工作都占先）。
