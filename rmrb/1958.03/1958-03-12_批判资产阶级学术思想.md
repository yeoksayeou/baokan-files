Criticizing Bourgeois Academic Thought
Lin Yushi

The struggle between bourgeois academic thought and proletarian academic thought is a class struggle in the ideological sphere. Bourgeois academic thought can only serve the capitalist social foundation and cannot serve the socialist social foundation. This contradiction is most prominent in the socialist revolution on the ideological front. However, when its nature is an academic ideological issue, belonging to the scope of academic issues within the people's internal contradictions, the method of handling this contradiction is different from handling the antagonistic contradictions of the two-road struggle in politics.

In politics, we advocate that the people of the whole country should be united, not divided, because abiding by the Constitution, loving the motherland, supporting the leadership of the Communist Party, and supporting socialism are the obligations of the people of the whole country.

However, disagreement in thought is unavoidable. This is not only because the coexistence of new and old superstructures and different ideological systems during the transition period shows disagreement, but even after the establishment of a socialist society, and even in a communist society, there will inevitably be differences between advanced and backward, materialism and idealism. Attempting to force consistency through simple administrative orders for such disagreements will not be effective. Therefore, we advocate that on ideological issues, everyone has the freedom to express their opinions and the freedom to criticize and counter-criticize. Using the method of free debate to eliminate bourgeois academic thought, overcome all erroneous ideas, develop the truth, and promote academic prosperity is our policy. We call this policy "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom."

The people of the whole country welcome "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" because it brings an unprecedentedly active atmosphere to our academic circles and encourages people's freedom of independent thinking. The bourgeois rightists also welcome "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," thinking that under the cover of this policy, they can have the freedom to traffic their anti-Party and anti-socialist private goods. Thus, they began by pretending to talk about the weather, expressing concerns, and probing; then they openly interpreted academic and cultural policies as political slogans, gathering crowds and clamoring loudly. In an instant, a clear sky for thousands of miles was filled with smog; the academic garden also became a political battlefield. But even during these days, the Party still adhered to the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" in academics and strictly distinguished between politics and academics. However, facts have shown that in the face of the rightists' frenzied attacks, it is impossible to smoothly implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy without first concentrating all efforts to smash their attacks politically. Therefore, at that time, we consciously put aside the issue of bourgeois academic thought. Even the academic thoughts of the rightists were not further criticized. Now that the struggle against the rightist offensive has achieved a great victory, the road for "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" has been cleared, and the task of criticizing bourgeois academic thought should be put on the agenda of the academic community.

Why do we emphasize the need to criticize bourgeois academic thought?

First, because it is an important link in completing the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The anti-rightist struggle is an extremely sharp struggle between us and the rightists for the middle-of-the-roaders. In the struggle, due to the exposure of the rightists' political ambitions and criminal activities, and due to the criticism and education of the workers, peasants, and left-wing intellectuals, those who were temporarily lost in the middle of the road have awakened, and have successively drawn a clear line with the rightists politically, and have returned to the side of the proletariat and the working people. Can we say that this shows that the middle-of-the-roaders are no longer half-hearted but wholeheartedly taking the socialist road? We cannot say that yet. In order to make the middle-of-the-roaders wholeheartedly follow the leftists, and to make some of them become leftists, it is not only necessary for them to draw a clear line with the rightists politically, but also to carry out self-reform ideologically, gradually abandoning the bourgeois world outlook and establishing the proletarian, communist world outlook. However, this cannot be resolved in one movement. That is to say, it will take a considerable amount of time to completely reform the wavering nature of the middle-of-the-roaders. Because the middle-of-the-roaders are not only influenced by the rightists politically, but also have many things in common with the rightists in academic thought, which is prominently manifested in the fact that some people still have deep feelings for bourgeois academics and find it difficult to "give up their love"; they often despise Marxism and are unwilling to bow their heads. Some even attempt to revise the fundamental principles of Marxism, or try their best to fight for raising the evaluation of idealism. This shows that a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology on the ideological front is inevitable. If we do not open fire on bourgeois academic thought and capture this fortress, we cannot consolidate the Marxist ideological position, nor can we promote the ideological transformation of the middle-of-the-roaders, so that they abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian world outlook. Of course, ideological transformation mainly relies on a person's self-consciousness, so we must patiently help people with bourgeois academic thought to master the weapon of self-criticism, and welcome them to conduct self-criticism of their erroneous academic thought. At the same time, in criticism, we must adhere to the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," allowing the criticized to have the freedom of counter-criticism, as well as the freedom to insist on their own opinions and reserve their own opinions.

However, it must be pointed out that the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is based on socialism. Adhering to the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" is to better help people overcome bourgeois ideas, not to encourage people to adhere to reactionary ideas. We believe that there is a distinction between political issues and ideological issues, and therefore we must treat them differently; but the two are not mutually exclusive. A person's actions are always inseparable from the guidance of their world outlook. Therefore, non-antagonistic ideological issues may, under certain conditions, be transformed into antagonistic political issues. Those who adhere to bourgeois ideas, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his rectification report, their conflict with the proletariat is inevitable. The only way out for bourgeois intellectuals is to transform themselves and serve the socialist foundation. People with bourgeois academic thought must seriously and conscientiously treat this issue.

Secondly, criticizing bourgeois academic thought is also an effective method of conducting socialist ideological education for the masses. After the socialist transformation of the three major sectors, the capitalist economic foundation has been basically eliminated, but we cannot therefore think that capitalist ideas no longer exist. This is not only because people's thinking always lags behind reality, but also because there is now a serious class struggle between the socialist world and the imperialist world; on the other hand, within our country, classes have not yet been completely eliminated, and class struggle still exists. Therefore, reactionary bourgeois ideas still have a broad market and widespread influence among the broad masses of working people, among intellectuals, in the field of academic culture, and even among some Party members and cadres. Bourgeois social science is precisely the theoretical, systematic, and centralized expression of all kinds of bourgeois ideas in social life. To establish the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism, we must break down the ideological fortress of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, while systematically and deeply criticizing bourgeois social science, we also conduct systematic and in-depth propaganda of Marxism-Leninism. This will enable Party cadres and intellectuals across the country (through them, the broad masses of the people) to receive more systematic socialist ideological education. This education will not only enable the people of the whole country to improve their sense of smell and learn to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds in actual life, and learn to fight against all kinds of reactionary ideas of bourgeois individualism, egalitarianism, anarchism, nationalism, etc.; but also enable the broad masses to despise bourgeois ideas and more consciously accept socialist ideas and support the socialist cause.

Third, criticizing bourgeois academic thought is also an effective method of training the working class's theoretical ranks and developing and enriching Marxism. Chairman Mao taught us that things cultivated in greenhouses will not have vitality. The anti-rightist struggle revealed that in some academic units, due to the weak political atmosphere at ordinary times, Marxism and bourgeois thought coexisted peacefully, so that a tendency to worship bourgeois academics and despise Marxism grew in many young theoretical cadres. When the bourgeois rightists stirred up trouble, many people lost their political direction, and some even degenerated into rightists. This fact just proves that Marxism and bourgeois academic thought are incompatible. It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. Therefore, to train theoretical cadres, we must pay attention to letting them learn how to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous flowers in the struggle against poisonous weeds; and learn how to weed out poisonous weeds.

Bourgeois social science is not only unscientific but also anti-scientific. Bourgeois scholars often list superficial phenomena and arbitrarily draw the conclusions they want to obtain from them; however, we cannot therefore think that it is enough to simply scold it down with a single sentence; and that it is not worthwhile to analyze and criticize this absurd theory. We cannot adopt such a simplistic attitude towards it, because:

First, the bourgeoisie is the last exploiting class in human society, and it still rules over more than half of the world's population; in our country, it has not yet been completely eliminated. The ideological system of this class, its anti-scientific theories, still have a market among the people of our country, especially among the broad masses of intellectuals, and still have the role of deceiving and confusing people.

Second, to refute some seemingly right but actually wrong absurd arguments, we need convincing scientific arguments. Some are not even problems of theoretical argumentation. Diderot said when criticizing Berkeley: "Those philosophers who only recognize their own existence and the existence of the sensations that alternate within our bodies, and do not recognize anything else, are called idealists. This bizarre system, in my opinion, can only be created by the blind! Although this system is extremely absurd, it is the most difficult to refute..." Lenin pointed out that Diderot was very close to the modern materialist view (thinking that arguments and syllogisms alone are not enough to refute idealism, and that the problem is not about theoretical arguments). (See Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 14, page 24) The problem here lies in practice. Practice is the most reliable standard for testing truth. By refuting these "bizarre systems" theoretically and practically, our theoretical level can be further improved, and the theory of Marxism can be further developed.

Third, the conclusions of bourgeois social science are reactionary and wrong, but there are also some knowledge materials in them that we can use. The rightists once slandered us for not valuing cultural heritage. If the so-called cultural heritage refers to these reactionary theories, then at most it can only be said that our criticism of them is not "valued" enough. As for the cultural heritage (including bourgeois social science), if there are really some things that are useful to us, we have never despised them. We have always advocated that they should be mobilized to serve the building of socialism. Only when using these knowledge materials, we must first criticize its reactionary conclusions. In short, when dealing with bourgeois academics, strategically we must despise it, because it is an anti-scientific thing; but tactically we must seriously analyze and criticize it in order to thoroughly refute it. At the same time, in this process of criticism, we can turn poisonous weeds into fertilizer, train our ranks, and develop and enrich Marxism.

Currently, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind internationally, and the people of the whole country are making a great leap forward domestically. The objective situation is extremely favorable for the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology on the ideological front. At the same time, due to the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, many senior intellectuals have begun to realize the harm of bourgeois academic thought and are eager to clarify the major issues of right and wrong in academic matters. Grasping the opportunity, implementing the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," and criticizing bourgeois academic thought is of great significance to the great leap forward in our academic circles.

    批判资产阶级学术思想
    林聿时
    资产阶级学术思想和无产阶级学术思想的斗争，是意识形态上的阶级斗争。资产阶级学术思想只能为资本主义社会基础服务，不能为社会主义社会基础服务，这种矛盾，在思想战线上的社会主义革命过程中表现得最为突出。但是，当它的性质是学术思想问题，属于人民内部矛盾的学术问题范围时，处理这一矛盾的方法，也就与处理政治上两条道路斗争的对抗性矛盾有所不同。
    在政治上我们主张全国人民应该一致，不应该不一致，因为遵守宪法，爱祖国，拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义，这是全国人民的义务。
    但是，在思想上不一致是不可避免的。这不仅仅在过渡时期由于新旧上层建筑并存，不同思想体系并存，才显出不一致，就是在社会主义社会建成以后，甚至在共产主义社会里，人与人之间也不可能没有先进与落后之分，唯物与唯心之别。像这样的不一致，企图通过行政命令的简单化办法强求一致，是不会有效的。因此，我们主张，在思想问题上，人人都有发表意见的自由，都有批评和反批评的自由。用自由争辩的方法，肃清资产阶级学术思想、克服一切错误思想、发展真理、繁荣学术，这是我们的政策。我们把这政策，叫做“百家争鸣”。
    全国人民欢迎“百家争鸣”，因为它给我国学术界带来空前活跃的空气，它鼓励了人们独立思考的自由。资产阶级右派也欢迎“百家争鸣”，以为在这一政策的掩盖下，可以有贩运其反党反社会主义私货的自由。于是，始则装模作样，谈天气，说顾虑，进行试探；继则明目张胆地把学术文化政策解释作政治口号，呼群聚类，大放大鸣。霎时间，千里晴空，弥漫乌烟瘴气；学术园地，也成政治战场。但就在这些日子里，党在学术上，仍然坚持“百家争鸣”的方针，严格区分政治和学术的界限。可是，事实表明，在右派分子疯狂进攻的情况下，如果不先在政治上集中全力粉碎他们的的进攻，要顺利贯彻百家争鸣政策，是不可能的。因此，当时我们有意识地把资产阶级学术思想问题搁在一边。即使是右派分子的学术思想，也没有进一步地进行批判。现在，反对右派进攻的斗争已经取得伟大胜利，百家争鸣的道路扫清了，批判资产阶级学术思想的任务应该提到学术界的议事日程上来了。
    为什么我们要强调提出批判资产阶级学术思想呢？
    首先，因为它是完成政治战线上和思想战线上社会主义革命的一个重要环节。反右派斗争是我们和右派争夺中间派的一场极为尖锐的斗争。在斗争中，由于右派分子政治野心和罪恶活动的被揭露，由于工农群众和知识分子左派的批评和教育，中间派中一时迷失了方向的人们都惊醒过来了，纷纷在政治上和右派划清了界限，重新站到无产阶级和劳动人民方面来。能不能说，这就是表明中间派不再是三心二意而是一心一意走社会主义道路了呢？还不能这样说。为使中间派一心一意地跟着左派走，并且使其中的一部分进而成为左派，就不仅要使他们在政治上同右派划清界限，而且要使他们在思想上进行自我改造，逐步抛弃资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级、共产主义世界观。但是，这不是一次运动能够得到解决的。就是说，要彻底革掉中间派的动摇性还需要一个相当长的时间。因为中间派不但在政治上受到右派的影响，而且在学术思想上和右派有许多相通的地方，突出表现在有些人对资产阶级学术还有深厚的感情，难于“割爱”；对马克思主义往往鄙视，不甘心低头。甚而有人企图修正马克思主义根本原理，或者千方百计地要为提高唯心主义评价而斗争。这说明在思想战线上兴无灭资的一场斗争是不可避免的。不对资产阶级学术思想开火，攻下这座堡垒，就不能够巩固马克思主义思想阵地，就不能够促进中间派思想改造，使他们放弃资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。当然，思想改造主要是依靠一个人的自觉，因此，必须耐心帮助有资产阶级学术思想的人们掌握自我批评的武器，欢迎他们对自己错误的学术思想进行自我批评。同时，在批评中我们必须坚持百家争鸣的方针，允许被批评者有反批评的自由，也有坚持自己意见和保留自己意见的自由。
    但是，必须指出：百家争鸣的政策是以社会主义为前提的。坚持百家争鸣政策是为了更好地帮助人们克服资产阶级思想，不是鼓励人们坚持反动思想。我们认为政治问题和思想问题是有区别的，因此必须加以区别对待；但是两者不是互不关连的，人的行动总是脱离不了世界观的指导，因此非对抗性的思想问题在一定条件下，就有可能转化为对抗性的政治问题。坚持资产阶级思想的人，正如邓小平同志在整风报告中所指出的，他们同无产阶级的冲突是不可避免的。资产阶级知识分子唯一的出路就是改造自己，为社会主义基础服务。有着资产阶级学术思想的人们必须严肃认真地对待这一问题。
    其次，批判资产阶级学术思想也是对群众进行社会主义思想教育的有效方法。经过社会主义三大改造，资本主义的经济基础已经基本消灭了，但却不能因此就认为资本主义的思想也不存在了。这不仅因为人的思想总是落后于实际，而且因为现在一方面有社会主义世界同帝国主义世界的严重的阶级斗争；另一方面，就我国内部来说，阶级还没有最后消灭，阶级斗争还是存在的。因此，反动的资产阶级思想在广大劳动人民中间，在知识分子中间，在学术文化领域中间，以至在党内一部分党员和干部中间，都还有广大的市场和广泛的影响。资产阶级社会科学恰好是社会生活中形形色色资产阶级思想的理论化、系统化、集中化的表现。要立马克思列宁主义的思想阵地，就不能不破资产阶级的思想堡垒。因此，在系统、深入地批判资产阶级社会科学的同时，也就对马克思列宁主义进行了系统和深入的宣传。这就会使得党的干部和全国知识分子（通过他们使广大人民群众）得到更为系统的社会主义思想教育。这种教育，不但会使全国人民提高嗅觉、学会在实际生活中识别香花和毒草，学会同形形色色资产阶级的个人主义、平均主义、无政府主义、民族主义等反动思想作斗争；而且会使广大群众更加鄙视资产阶级思想，更加自觉接受社会主义思想，拥护社会主义事业。
    第三，批判资产阶级学术思想也是一种锻炼工人阶级理论队伍，发展和丰富马克思主义的有效方法。毛主席教导我们说，在温室里培养出来的东西是不会有生命力的。反右派斗争中曾经揭露出：某些学术单位，由于平时政治空气淡薄，马克思主义和资产阶级思想和平共居，以致在许多青年理论干部中滋长着一种崇拜资产阶级学术，藐视马克思主义的倾向。当资产阶级右派兴风作浪的时候，不少人就迷失了政治方向，一部分人竟堕落为右派。这一事实恰好证明马克思主义和资产阶级学术思想是势不两立的，不是东风压倒西风，便是西风压倒东风。因此，培养理论干部，必须注意到让他们在同毒草斗争中学会识别香花和毒花的本领；学会锄掉毒草的本领。
    资产阶级社会科学不仅是不科学的而且是反科学的，资产阶级学者常常罗列表面现象，从中任意引出他们所要得到的结论来；但是，却不能因此便认为只要简单地用一句话骂倒它就可以了；认为对这种荒谬理论进行分析、批判是值不得、花不来的事情。我们不能采取这样简单化的态度对待它，因为：
    第一，资产阶级是人类社会中最后的一个剥削阶级，它在世界范围内还统治着一半以上的人口；在我国，也还没有最后消灭。这个阶级的思想体系，它的反科学理论，在我国人民中，特别在广大知识分子中还有市场，还有欺骗和迷惑的作用。
    第二，有些似是而非的荒谬论断，要驳倒它，需要有说服力的科学的论证。有的甚至不是理论上论证的问题。狄德罗在批评贝克莱的时候说：“那些只承认自己的存在和我们体内彼此更替着的感觉的存在，而不承认其他任何东西的哲学家，叫作唯心主义者，这种怪诞的体系，在我看来，只有瞎子才会创造出来！这种体系虽然荒谬之至，可是最难驳倒……”列宁指出，狄德罗非常接近现代唯物主义的看法（认为单靠论据和三段论法不足以驳倒唯心主义的，这里的问题还不在于理论上的论证）。（见列宁全集第十四卷第二十四页）这里的问题在于实践，实践是检验真理的最可靠的标准。从理论上和实践上驳倒这些“怪诞的体系”，我们的理论水平可以进一步提高，马克思主义的理论可以进一步发展。
    第三，资产阶级社会科学的结论是反动的，错误的，但其中也有些知识材料，是我们可以利用的。右派曾经诬蔑我们不重视文化遗产。如果所谓文化遗产指的是这些反动理论，那么至多只能说，我们对它们的批判还“重视”得不够。至于文化遗产（包括资产阶级社会科学）中如果真正有些对我们有用的东西，我们从来没有轻视过，我们向来都是主张应该把它调动起来为建设社会主义服务。只是利用这些知识材料时，首先必须批判其反动结论。总之，对待资产阶级学术，在战略上我们必须鄙视它，蔑视它，因为它是反科学的东西；但在战术上我们必须认真地予以分析、批判，以便彻底驳倒它，同时在这一批判过程中，把毒草变为肥料，锻炼我们的队伍，发展和丰富马克思主义。
    目前，国际上东风压倒西风，国内全国人民都在大跃进。客观的形势对于思想战线上兴无灭资的斗争极为有利。同时，由于反右派斗争的胜利，许多高级知识分子已开始认识到资产阶级学术思想的有害，迫切要求在学术问题上弄清大是大非。抓紧时机，贯彻百家争鸣方针，批判资产阶级学术思想，对于我国学术界的大跃进是有重大意义的。
