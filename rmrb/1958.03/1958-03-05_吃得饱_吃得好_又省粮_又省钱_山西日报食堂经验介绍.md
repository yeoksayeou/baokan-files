    Eating Well, Eating Enough, Saving Grain, and Saving Money
    ——Introducing the Experience of the Shanxi Daily Cafeteria
    Yuan Bin, Deputy Chief of the Administrative Welfare Section of Shanxi Daily
    Since the Shanxi Daily's staff cafeteria launched a grain-saving campaign in September of last year, it has greatly improved management and created ten varieties of dishes that use non-staple foods to replace staple foods. By December, it had saved more than 6,177 jin (over 3,000 kg) of grain for the country (an average of more than 4 jin per person), truly ensuring that all employees ate well and were full. As a result, it won the honorary title of Model Cafeteria of Taiyuan City.
    How did we manage to ensure that everyone ate well and was full while also completing the savings task?
    Initially, the government proposed a target of saving 4 to 8 jin of grain per person per month, and we began to develop a plan according to this target. However, many comrades expressed doubts and lacked confidence. Some said, "To eat well and be full, each person can only save one jin; saving more will not guarantee that we can eat well and be full." Some said, "Being responsible to the country means not being responsible to the masses, and being responsible to the masses means not being responsible to the country." Some even bluntly said, "Just wait and starve; saving four to eight jin is just going to lead to drinking thin porridge! Anyway, this is to make the cadres suffer a little more and get some exercise." After discussion, we criticized this thinking, adhered to the principle of being responsible to both the country and the masses, and drew up a savings plan. Although the thinking was clear, due to lack of practical experience, we slipped into simply starting from a savings perspective, drinking hezi fan (vegetable porridge) for breakfast and dinner, which was very tense. I individually solicited the opinions of the comrades, and the answer I got was: "Buddy, this won't work; no matter how full we are from drinking this, we're hungry again in a little while." Our cafeteria staff was very panicked when they heard this. We immediately realized that we cannot simply cut back in order to save, but must find ways to ensure that the comrades eat well and are full in order to ensure their good health and good work.
    What method can we use to ensure that everyone eats well and is full? We mobilized all the cafeteria staff to use their brains to find solutions. At first, we proposed a method of making stuffed foods such as pies and shaomai, and immediately tried it out. The effect was good; it was not only delicious, but also saved grain. Compared to eating hezi fan, eating shaomai, pies, and other stuffed foods only required 45 jin of grain, compared to 55 jin for hezi fan. This gave us a great inspiration, and we put forward a slogan of eating less or no porridge, and eating as many stuffed foods as possible. The comrades were very satisfied, and our confidence also increased.
    Next, we came up with a series of methods to replace staple foods with non-staple foods, and elevated the status of non-staple foods to that of staple foods, treating non-staple foods as staple foods. We added a large amount of potatoes, sweet potatoes, vegetables, etc., to various meals. For example, on average, we added 30% to 70% potatoes or 30% to 50% vegetables to the staple foods to replace grain.
    How can we make everyone feel that such a large amount of potatoes and vegetables is delicious and filling? Here, our cooks demonstrated a high degree of creativity, creating a variety of dishes. We made full use of steaming, boiling, frying, grilling, and other techniques, and made the food delicious and beautiful through various processing methods. For example, steamed dishes include dumplings, buns, shaomai, and vegetable cakes; fried dishes include buns, pies, vegetable hezi, and pot stickers; boiled dishes include dumplings; grilled dishes include pies; and fried dishes include mahua and fried rice cakes. These foods are relatively palatable, and everyone feels that the dumplings, shaomai, pies, and crisp cakes (referring to the dough) made with 30% to 70% potatoes are delicious. In particular, the bread made with 75% potatoes and 25% white flour is even more delicious. Wotou, vegetable cakes, steamed bread, and vegetable rolls with vegetables are also very popular. At the same time, we often pay attention to adjusting and changing things in management. For example, if we eat radish pastries in the morning today, we will change them to cabbage pastries tomorrow morning. Sometimes we have steamed buns, rice, or millet rice for lunch and dinner, and sometimes we have dumplings, pies, etc. Therefore, everyone does not get tired of eating. Here, there are no restrictions. Whoever wants to eat something can buy it, and can buy as much as they want, so they can eat well and be full.
    We also increased the amount of meat, oil, sugar, fruit, dairy products, and alcohol to enrich everyone's nutrition. In addition to buying meat and oil according to the supply quota, we bought a lot of donkey meat, donkey oil, and other mixed oils, as well as rabbit meat, chicken, duck, fish, and other foods in the market. Thus, on the daily menu, there are not only meat dishes for eight cents and stir-fried sauerkraut for three cents, but also braised fish and stewed chicken for 25 cents, as well as various shredded meat and vegetable soups. In the specially established snack department, there are cooked meat, alcohol, and fruit. We use mixed oils to cook dishes, and save sesame oil to fry potato and sweet potato fried cakes and mahua and make fried foods. People's consumption of fried or pan-fried foods has decreased, while also saving grain.
    People may ask: must the cost of your cafeteria be very high, or have everyone's food expenses increased? Also, where do you get so many non-staple foods from?
    This is indeed a problem. We pay close attention to cost accounting and must never increase everyone's living expenses too much due to saving grain. Our costs have not increased. Eating more meat and oil means eating less staple food, which also saves money. For example, most people eat seven steamed dumplings, which cost 21 cents, but six fried dumplings are enough, which also cost 21 cents. Because some foods are very cheap, such as a potato and white flour crisp cake weighing 2.7 taels, each costs 3.3 cents, while each made with pure white flour costs 3.7 cents. This way, people will not spend more. Of course, it is an exception for individual comrades to eat well and increase their expenses. According to average figures, we calculated that the average food cost per person in the second cafeteria in September of last year was 12.42 yuan, which was 0.33 yuan lower than in August of the same year.
    Our purchasing agent, Comrade Zhou Minghui, made a great contribution to increasing the supply of non-staple foods. In order to ensure that everyone eats well, he worked tirelessly all day long, running all over the large and small food markets in Taiyuan City and most of the suburban agricultural cooperatives in Hedong and Hexi, establishing contacts with them, ensuring supply, and ensuring low prices, no backlog, and no waste.
    The reason why we have achieved some success in running the cafeteria is also due to strengthening the political and ideological work of the cooks. After the anti-Rightist struggle, their ideological awareness has been greatly improved. On this basis, we launched a six-competition campaign among the cafeteria staff (namely: compare savings, variety, quality, cost, hygiene, and attitude). In the competition, they boldly innovated, exchanged technologies, learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, and gave full play to their technical expertise and work enthusiasm. For example, cook Hu Binglan came up with the idea of ​​making vegetable pastries with both fermented and unfermented dough, and adding salt, soda, spices, etc. to them, while paying attention to the heat, so that they are delicious without strange tastes, comfortable and easy to digest, and delicious and attractive. We pay more attention to caring for the cooks in all aspects. For example, we help them treat diseases in a timely manner, issue various hygiene products, organize them to dine together and watch movies during festivals, shorten their working hours, implement shift breaks, and allow each person to rest once a week, so that they can always maintain full work enthusiasm. Therefore, they all actively and proactively think of ways to run the cafeteria well.

    吃得饱  吃得好  又省粮  又省钱
    ——山西日报食堂经验介绍
    山西日报行政福利科副科长　原斌
    山西日报机关食堂从去年9月开展节约粮食运动以来，大大改善了管理，创造了十种以副食品代替主食品的花样，到12月为止，为国家节省了六千一百七十七斤多（每人平均四斤多）粮食，真正做到保证所有职工吃得好吃得饱。因而获得了太原市模范食堂的光荣称号。
    我们怎样做到既保证大家吃好吃饱，又完成节约任务呢？
    开始，政府提出每人每月节约粮食四至八斤的指标，我们按照这个指标着手制定方案。但是有不少同志表示怀疑，信心不足。有的说：“要吃饱吃好，每人只能节约一斤；节约多了就不能保证吃饱吃好。”有的说：“对国家负责就不能对群众负责，对群众负责就不能对国家负责”。有的甚至干脆说：“等着饿肚子吧，节约四至八斤还不是去让喝稀饭！反正这是让干部多吃点苦，锻炼锻炼。”我们经过讨论，批判了这种思想，坚持了对国家负责，也对群众负责的节约方针，订出了一个节约方案。虽然思想明确，但由于没有实践经验，又蹓到单纯从节约观点出发了，早晚喝和子饭（菜稀饭），弄得很紧张。我个别征求了一下同志们的意见，得到的回答是：伙计，这样下去不行哪，喝上多饱，一会儿就又饿了。我们食堂工作人员听到这话就非常发慌。我们立即认识到，不能单纯为了节约而去死卡，必须想办法保证同志们吃饱吃好，才能保证他们身体好，工作好。
    用什么办法能保证大家吃饱吃好呢？我们便发动全体食堂工作人员都来开动脑筋想办法。开始提出了一个作馅饼、稍梅等吃带馅食品的办法，马上试行，效果良好，不但好吃，且能省粮。跟吃和子饭比较了一下：原来吃和子饭用粮五十五斤，改为吃稍梅、馅饼等带馅的只用四十五斤粮就够了。这给我们以很大启示，我们提出了一条少吃或不吃稀饭，尽量多吃带馅食品的口号。同志们很满意，我们的信心也高了。
    接着，我们又想出了一系列以副食品代替主食品的办法，并且把副食品提高到主食地位，把副食当主食吃。山药蛋、红薯、蔬菜等，大量掺在各种饭里来吃。比如在主食里平均加30％到70％的薯类，或30％—50％的蔬菜代替粮食。
    掺这样多的薯类、蔬菜又怎么使大家感到好吃而吃的饱呢？这里，我们的炊事人员发挥了高度的创造性，创造了多种花色品种。我们充分发挥了蒸、煮、煎、烤、炸等技术作用，经过各种加工，使食品好吃而又美观了。如蒸的有饺子、饱子、稍梅、菜饼等；煎的有饱子、馅饼、菜合子、锅贴；煮的有水饺等；烤的有馅饼等；炸的麻叶、油糕、麻花等。这些食品都比较可口，掺有30％至70％薯类作成的饺子、稍梅、馅饼、擦酥饼（指包皮），大家都觉得味美好吃。尤其是以75％山药蛋和25％白面合做成的面包，更好吃。掺有蔬菜的窝窝头、菜糕、闷饼、菜卷等品种也深受大家欢迎。同时我们在管理上经常注意调剂、调换，比如今天早晨吃萝卜糕点，明天早晨就改成白菜糕点，中、下午饭有时候是蒸馍，大米或二米，有时候是饺子、馅饼等。所以大家食而不厌。在我们这里，没有限制，谁想吃啥就买啥，想吃多少买多少，因而就吃饱吃好了。
    我们还增加大量的肉类、油类、糖、水果、奶品、酒等食品，丰富了大家的营养。我们除了按供应数量买到肉和油以外，在市场上大量地买到了驴肉、驴油等杂油和兔肉、鸡、鸭、鱼等食品。于是在每日的菜单上，既有八分钱的肉烩菜，三分钱的炒酸菜，又有两角五分钱的红烧鱼和燉鸡肉，还有各种肉丝杂菜汤。在专门设立的小食部里有熟肉、酒和水果。我们拿杂油来作菜，省下麻油来炸山药、红薯油糕、麻叶，做油煎食品。经过油炸或煎过的食品，人们的用量减少了，同时又节约了粮食。
    人们也许要问：你们食堂的成本一定很高，或者使大家的伙食费开支增加了吧？同时你们那么多的副食品从何而来呢？
    这的确是个问题。我们十分注意成本核算，绝不能因为节约粮食过多地提高大家的生活开支。我们的成本没有提高。吃肉和油多了就少吃主食，也就少花了钱。比如一般人吃蒸饺子要吃七个，计二角一分，经过油煎有六个即够，也是两角一。因为有的食品很便宜，如二两七重的山药蛋白面擦酥饼，每个价三分三厘多，而纯白面做成的每个就有三分七厘多。这样人们就不会开支多了。当然个别同志吃得好，增加开支那是例外。按照平均数字，我们统计了一下，第二食堂在去年9月份每人平均伙食费十二元四角二，比同年8月份降低三角三分。
    在增加副食品上，我们的采购员周铭讳同志贡献很大。他为了保证大家吃好饭，不辞辛苦终日忙碌，跑遍了太原市的所有大、小食品市场和河东、河西大部分郊区农业合作社，和他们建立了联系，保证了供应，并且作到价格低，不积压和不浪费。
    我们所以把食堂办得有点成绩也还是由于加强了对炊事人员的政治思想工作。他们经过反右派斗争，思想觉悟有了很大提高，在这个基础上，我们发动食堂工作人员开展了六比竞赛（即：比节约、花样、质量、成本、卫生、态度），在竞赛中大胆革新，技术交流，互相取长补短，充分发挥了他们的技术专长和工作积极性。如炊事员胡秉兰，想出了用发酵和不发酵两种面作菜糕点，并且在里边加盐、苏打、香料等，同时注意火色，达到了好吃没怪味，舒服好消化，美味吸引人。我们更注意从各方面关怀炊事人员。如及时帮助他们治疗疾病，发给各种卫生用品，在节日里组织他们会餐、看电影，缩短他们的工作时间，实行轮班休息，每人每周可休息一次，使他们经常保持饱满的工作热情。因而他们都主动地积极地想办法，把食堂办好。
