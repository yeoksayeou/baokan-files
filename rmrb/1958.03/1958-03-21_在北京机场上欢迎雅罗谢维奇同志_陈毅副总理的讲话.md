    Speech by Vice Premier Chen Yi
    Dear Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, dear comrades of the Polish government delegation, comrades, friends:
    Today, we are very happy to be able to welcome the Polish government delegation headed by Comrade Jaroszewicz, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Poland, in Beijing. Please allow me, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to express our heartfelt and warm welcome to our distinguished guests who have come from afar.
    The Chinese people have a deep friendship with the fraternal Polish people. Although our two countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the common goals of our struggle closely link the people of our two countries together. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been continuously consolidated and developed. We are pleased to see that the Polish people are working hard to further increase production. The common high tide of the national economies of our two countries will undoubtedly provide more possibilities for economic cooperation between our two countries. I am convinced that your friendly visit will further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Poland, thereby promoting the socialist construction of our two countries. Please allow me to once again express my welcome to you and wish your visit a complete success.
    Long live the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Polish people!
    Long live the unity and cooperation among the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live world peace!
