Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China

The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council will hold a meeting in Manila starting March 11th. Western colonial countries, led by the United States, are attempting to further interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries through this meeting, accelerate arms expansion and war preparations, establish US nuclear weapons and rocket bases on the territory of Asian member countries of this group, expand the scope of this aggressive bloc, and intensify tensions in the Asian and Pacific regions. These aggressive conspiracies by the United States run completely counter to the strong desire of peace-loving countries and people around the world, especially peace-loving countries and people in Asia, to end the Cold War and strive for further relaxation of international tensions.

The United States has been using the Manila aggressive bloc to interfere in the internal affairs of many Southeast Asian countries under the pretext of opposing so-called communist subversion activities, and recently it has directed its spearhead at Indonesia. Not long ago, US Secretary of State Dulles made remarks opposing the Indonesian President and government, rudely interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign country. At the same time, everyone knows that Manila and Singapore have become the main bases for Indonesian rebels to obtain supplies and conduct liaison. The US Seventh Fleet has even sailed to the vicinity of Indonesian territorial waters under the guise of holding exercises to conduct demonstrations and intimidation. At this Manila meeting, the United States is attempting to win over more countries to further interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. This cannot but arouse serious attention from all peace-loving countries and people who cherish their sovereignty. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Indonesian government and people to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and oppose foreign interference and subversion conspiracies, and firmly believe that this struggle will achieve final victory. The Chinese government believes that the Asian member countries of the Manila Group should abide by the obligations they assumed at the Bandung Asian-African Conference, refuse to follow the United States in interfering in the internal affairs of another Asian country; they should see that pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States will not bring them any benefits. The Chinese government considers it necessary to point out that the United States' interference in Indonesia has aroused increasingly widespread condemnation and opposition from the Indonesian people and the Asian people, and any further action will cause serious consequences. The United States must immediately stop interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, otherwise it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

As in the previously held Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact, this time at the Manila meeting, the United States is also attempting to expand its network of nuclear weapons and rocket bases in the Asian and Pacific regions. The United States has set up bases for launching nuclear warhead rockets in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, which are Chinese territories occupied by the United States, aggravating the tense situation in the Far East and already arousing strong opposition from the Chinese people and the peoples of Asian countries. Now attempting to establish these bases in more countries will not only strengthen the United States' control over these countries, increase the danger of war, but also, once the United States provokes a war, will first bring incalculable disasters to these countries. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the United States setting up nuclear weapons and rocket weapons in any region of Asia, and actively advocate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free peace zone in Asia and the conclusion of a collective peace treaty. We believe that this is entirely in the vital interests of the people of Asian countries. However, among the Asian member countries participating in the Manila Group, some leaders openly welcomed the United States to establish nuclear weapons and rocket bases on their territory, regardless of their own national interests and the opposition of the people of the world. China is an Asian country, and China shares with these countries the obligation to abide by the resolution of the Bandung Asian-African Conference on the Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. As a neighbor of these countries, the Chinese government cannot but express serious concern about the establishment of US nuclear weapons and rocket bases on the territory of these countries.

The people of the world yearn for peace and fervently demand that Eastern and Western countries conduct consultations, prohibit atomic weapons and nuclear weapons, and achieve peaceful coexistence among the people of all countries. In order to realize these wishes and demands, the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries have proposed and adopted a series of peaceful initiatives and proactive measures, which have been universally welcomed and supported by the people of all countries. However, the US ruling clique is trying to obstruct the development of this mainstream in the international situation, insisting on arms expansion and war preparations, and maintaining the increasingly shaky aggressive bloc. This Manila meeting is precisely a manifestation of this struggle by the United States. This perverse practice of the United States can only place it in a more isolated position, and can never stop the powerful peaceful trend in the world today. As long as the people of Asian countries strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and persist in struggle, all the conspiracies carried out by the United States and Western colonial countries through the Manila Group are doomed to failure.

### 我政府发表声明谴责马尼拉会议阴谋活动  主张在亚洲建立无核武器地区  反对美国干涉东南亚国家内政　支持印度尼西亚正义斗争

    我政府发表声明谴责马尼拉会议阴谋活动
    主张在亚洲建立无核武器地区
    反对美国干涉东南亚国家内政　支持印度尼西亚正义斗争
    新华社10日讯　中华人民共和国政府声明
    东南亚条约组织理事会从3月11日起在马尼拉举行会议。以美国为首的西方殖民主义国家企图通过这次会议进一步干涉东南亚国家的内政，加紧扩军备战，在这个集团的亚洲成员国家领土上建立美国的核武器和火箭基地，扩大这个侵略集团的活动范围，加剧亚洲和太平洋地区的紧张局势。美国的这些侵略阴谋，同目前全世界爱好和平的国家和人民、首先是亚洲爱好和平的国家和人民要求结束冷战、争取进一步和缓国际紧张局势的强烈愿望是完全背道而驰的。
    美国一直利用马尼拉侵略集团在反对所谓共产主义颠覆活动的借口下，干涉许多东南亚国家的内政，最近以来更把它的矛头指向了印度尼西亚。不久以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经发表反对印度尼西亚总统和政府的谈话，粗暴地干预一个主权国家的内部事务。同时，谁都知道，马尼拉和新加坡已经成为印度尼西亚叛乱分子得到供应和进行联络的主要基地。美国第七舰队更以举行演习为名，开到印度尼西亚的领海附近进行示威和恐吓。在这次马尼拉会议上，美国企图拉拢更多的国家对印度尼西亚的内政进行进一步干涉。这就不能不引起一切爱好和平和珍视自己主权的国家和人民的严重注意。中国政府和中国人民完全支持印度尼西亚政府和人民为维护国家的独立和主权、反对外来的干涉和颠覆阴谋所进行的正义斗争，并且深信这一斗争一定会取得最后胜利。中国政府认为，马尼拉集团的亚洲成员国家应该遵守它们在万隆亚非会议上所承担的义务，拒绝追随美国干涉另一个亚洲国家的内政；它们应该看到，替美国火中取栗是不会对它们带来任何好处的。中国政府认为有必要指出：美国对印度尼西亚的干涉，已经引起印度尼西亚人民和亚洲人民日益广泛的谴责和反对，任何进一步的行动必将引起严重后果。美国必须立即停止对印度尼西亚内政的干涉，否则它必须对于由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任。
    同在前不久举行的北大西洋公约的巴黎会议和巴格达条约的安卡拉会议上一样，这一次，在马尼拉会议上美国还企图扩大它在亚洲和太平洋地区的核武器和火箭的基地网。美国在被它侵占的中国领土台湾、南朝鲜和日本设置发射核弹头的火箭的基地，加剧了远东的紧张局势，并且已经引起了中国人民和亚洲各国人民的强烈反对。现在企图在更多的国家里建立这些基地，不仅将加强美国对这些国家的控制，增加了战争的危险，而且一旦美国挑起战争，还将首先对这些国家带来难以估量的灾难。中国政府和中国人民坚决反对美国在亚洲任何地区设置核武器和火箭武器，积极主张在亚洲建立无原子武器的和平地区和缔结集体和平公约。我们认为，这是完全符合亚洲各国人民的切身利益的。但是，在参加马尼拉集团的亚洲成员国家中，竟然有些领导人不顾本国利益和全世界人民的反对，公然表示欢迎美国在本国领土上设立核武器和火箭的基地。中国是一个亚洲国家，中国同这些国家共同负有遵守万隆亚非会议关于和平共处十项原则的决议的义务。作为这些国家的邻国，中国政府不能不对在这些国家的领土上建立美国的核武器和火箭的基地表示严重的关切。
    全世界人民都渴望和平，热烈要求东西方国家进行协商、禁止原子武器和核武器，实现各国人民之间的和平共处。为了实现这些愿望和要求，苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家提出和采取了一系列的和平倡议和主动措施，得到了全世界各国人民的普遍的欢迎和支持。但是，美国统治集团力图阻挠国际形势中这一主流的发展，坚持扩军备战，维系日益动摇的侵略集团。这次马尼拉会议正是美国这种挣扎的一个表现。美国这种倒行逆施的做法，只能使它处于更加孤立的地位，而绝不能阻挡当前世界上强大的和平潮流。只要亚洲各国人民加强团结，提高警惕，坚持斗争，美国和西方殖民国家通过马尼拉集团所进行的一切阴谋活动都是注定要失败的。一九五八年三月十日
