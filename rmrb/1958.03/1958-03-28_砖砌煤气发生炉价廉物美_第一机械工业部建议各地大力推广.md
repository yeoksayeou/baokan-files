Xinhua News Agency, March 26th - The First Ministry of Machine Building requests all regions to vigorously promote the brick-built or jar-made gas generators jointly created by workers and farmers in the Tianjin Special District.

Gas engines are one of the power machines supplied to agriculture for drainage and irrigation this year in our country, and the production quantity is very large. The First Ministry of Machine Building believes that vigorously promoting brick-built or jar-made gas generators has three major benefits: First, it can save a large amount of steel. According to preliminary calculations, if most of the gas engines produced in 1958 use brick-built or jar-made furnaces, it can save approximately nearly 10,000 tons of steel. Second, this type of furnace can use local materials, is easy to manufacture, and because it reduces the burden on factories to produce large quantities of gas generators, the supply of gas engines can be faster. Third, the manufacturing cost is low. A brick-built or jar-made furnace costs about 30 yuan, while a steel gas generator of the same capacity costs about 200 yuan. At the same time, since the gas engine is not shipped with the gas generator, some transportation costs can also be reduced.

This type of gas generator created by workers and farmers in the Tianjin Special District was tested and identified by the Tractor Research Institute designated by the First Ministry of Machine Building, and some improvements were made to reduce the coal consumption per horsepower-hour from 2 kilograms to 0.75 kilograms. Now the Tractor Research Institute has made a standard design, ready for promotion and use in various regions. (Attached picture)

    砖砌煤气发生炉价廉物美
    第一机械工业部建议各地大力推广
    据新华社26日讯　第一机械工业部要求各地大力推广天津专区工人和农民共同创造的用砖砌或缸制的煤气发生炉。
    煤气机是我国今年供应农业排水灌溉用的动力机械之一，生产数量很大。第一机械工业部认为，大力推广砖砌或缸制的煤气发生炉有三大好处：首先，可以节约大量钢材。据初步计算，1958年生产的煤气机如大部采用砖砌或缸制的炉子，就能节约钢材约近一万吨。其次，这种炉子可以就地取材，制造方便，并且由于减少了工厂生产大量煤气发生炉的负担，就可以使煤气机的供应更为迅速。第三，制造成本低，一个砖砌或缸制的炉子约需成本三十元左右，而一个同等能力的钢材发生炉价值却达二百元左右，同时由于煤气机出厂时不带发生炉，还可减少部分运输费用。
    天津专区工人和农民创造的这种煤气发生炉，是由第一机械工业部指定拖拉机研究所试验鉴定的，并且作了部分改进，使每马力小时的耗煤量从二公斤降低到零点七五公斤。现在拖拉机研究所已作出标准设计，准备供各地区推广使用。（附图片）
