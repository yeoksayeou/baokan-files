Xinhua News Agency, Andong, March 16th: This afternoon, the Chinese people held a grand rally in Andong to welcome the Chinese People's Delegation Welcoming the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country.

Among those attending the rally were Chen Shutong, head of the delegation; deputy heads Wang Weizhou, Shao Lizi, Gao Chongmin, and Li Zhuchen; all members of the delegation; responsible persons from the Liaoning Province, Andong City Party, government, and military; and over ten thousand people from all walks of life in Andong City.

On the rostrum hung giant portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Kim Il-sung, along with the national flags of China and North Korea.

At 1:00 PM, as the returning heroes entered the venue, the entire audience erupted in firecrackers, gongs, drums, and cheers. Countless colorful balloons were released into the venue, and large balloons with slogans such as "Welcome the Glorious Return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" were raised.

When all members of the delegation accompanied the leaders of the first group of returning Volunteer Army troops, including Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, Major General Wang Mingkun, Major General Xie Fulin, and representatives of officers and soldiers, onto the rostrum, the entire audience once again burst into thunderous applause.

The rally began with the national anthems of China and North Korea. Chen Shutong, head of the delegation and vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, delivered a welcoming speech. On behalf of the Communist Party of China, all people's organizations, all democratic parties, and the people of the entire nation, he extended a warm welcome to the heroic Volunteer Army soldiers who had made great contributions and offered his sincere regards. (See page 2 for details.)

Moon Jae-soo, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the North Korean Embassy in China, also spoke at the rally. On behalf of the embassy, he conveyed the deep gratitude of the Korean people to the returning Volunteer Army troops who had made great contributions in the struggle to defend the freedom and independence of the Korean people and peace in the Far East, as well as to the people of Andong City and all the Chinese people who actively supported the Korean front. Moon Jae-soo said that the root cause of the division of Korea lies in the presence of the U.S. aggressor troops in South Korea and the U.S. policy of aggression. Therefore, all the Korean people strongly demand that the U.S. military and all other foreign troops withdraw from South Korea completely.

Zhang Xuexuan, a member of the delegation and Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, first introduced the achievements of the people of Liaoning Province in over-fulfilling the First Five-Year Plan in his speech. He then said: The broad masses of the people in Liaoning Province are eagerly awaiting your arrival with incomparable enthusiasm to hear about the heroic deeds of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea struggle, so as to learn from your spirit of hard work and further stir up the revolutionary drive for the great leap forward in socialist construction.

Yin Yongjie, Mayor of Andong City, said in his speech that the people of Andong City had been threatened by the flames of aggression of U.S. imperialism, and therefore better understood the great significance of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend their country. Therefore, the people of the entire city not only actively supported the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but also achieved brilliant achievements in socialist construction after the victory of the Korean War.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, head of the first group of returning Volunteer Army troops, said in his reply that when our train crossed the Yalu River Bridge and stepped onto the land that nurtured and raised us, our hearts were filled with boundless excitement. He said that from the very first day the Volunteer Army entered North Korea to participate in the war, it had been working hard to achieve a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. After the Korean armistice, the Volunteer Army had voluntarily withdrawn nineteen divisions from North Korea in three separate occasions. This time, after the joint statement issued by the governments of China and North Korea, the Volunteer Army began to withdraw its troops from North Korea, which once again proves to the world that the Volunteer Army's resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea was a completely just action. He also expressed on behalf of all officers and soldiers: Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go; whatever the motherland needs us to do, we will do. We will maintain the glorious title of "the most beloved people" given to us by the people of the motherland. (See page 2 for details.)

Before the end of the rally, representatives of the Volunteer Army presented gifts to the Chinese People's Delegation Welcoming the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country. Four soldier representatives presented rhododendron flowers, stones, black soil, and fragments of bombs used by the U.S. aggressor troops to bomb Korean peaceful villages, collected from the heroic battlefields of Maliang Mountain, Dingzi Mountain, and Laotou Mountain, to the delegation. Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun also placed an ancient Korean sword on the body of delegation leader Chen Shutong. This ancient sword was a family heirloom of an elderly Korean man in Pyongyang, who gave it to Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun when the Volunteer Army was leaving North Korea.

The rally ended with the magnificent Volunteer Army battle song. After the rally, the people of Andong City held a warm celebration with the returning heroes in the square.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, March 16th: The vanguard of the first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops arrived today in Andong, the heroic city on the border of the motherland.

The returning heroes were warmly welcomed at the station by the Chinese People's Delegation Welcoming the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country, headed by Chen Shutong, as well as responsible persons from the Liaoning Province, Andong City Party, government, and military, and over two thousand people from all walks of life in Andong City.

Moon Jae-soo, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the North Korean Embassy in China, also came to the station to welcome them.

Today, Andong City was decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and national flags were flying high. From the Yalu River to Andong Station, welcome slogans were everywhere. On the wall of a tall building facing the Yalu River, two large characters, "Welcome," were written, visible from several miles away.

At 11:40 AM, the train carrying the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers crossed the Yalu River Bridge and passed through the triumphal arch erected by the motherland for the heroes. The train cars were inscribed with: "The Sons and Daughters of the Motherland Have Returned." As the cheers of the Korean people on the south bank of the river faded, the sound of gongs, drums, and cheers rose again on the north bank.

Portraits of Chairman Mao and Premier Kim Il-sung hung in front of the locomotive. As the train, adorned with fresh flowers, slowly entered the station, a burst of cheers, slogans, firecrackers, and gongs and drums erupted. As soon as the train came to a stop, a group of children, holding flowers, ran into the train cars, shouting, "Hello, Volunteer Army Uncles!"

Huang Zhifu, a Volunteer Army soldier known as "Living Luo Shengjiao" by the Korean people, and others, asked Xu Guangping, a member of the Chinese People's Delegation Welcoming the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country, to sign an autograph. Xu Guangping embraced Huang Zhifu and tied a red scarf given to her by a returning soldier around Huang Zhifu's neck.

At 12:45 PM, after the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers on the second train arrived in Andong, the heroes who arrived one after another entered the welcome rally venue in the station square amidst cheers.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, March 16th: The Chinese People's Delegation Welcoming the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country held a grand banquet in Andong tonight to welcome representatives of the vanguard of the first group of returning Volunteer Army troops.

Those attending the banquet included: all members of the delegation welcoming the Volunteer Army's return to the country, responsible persons from the Liaoning Province, Andong City Party, government, and military, representatives from all walks of life in Andong City, and representatives of the vanguard of the first group of returning Volunteer Army troops, totaling more than 300 people.

Moon Jae-soo, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the North Korean Embassy in China, was also invited to attend the banquet.

Wang Weizhou, deputy head of the delegation and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the banquet. He congratulated the Volunteer Army for gloriously completing the sacred mission entrusted to them by the people of the motherland to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend their country, and welcomed the Volunteer Army heroes to rejoin the socialist peaceful construction of the motherland.

Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun, head of the first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops, raised his glass at the banquet to toast the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and to the good health of all members of the Chinese People's Delegation Welcoming the Volunteer Army's Return to the Country.

    车辚辚　马萧萧　凯歌贯云霄
    最可爱的人回来了
    安东举行盛大欢迎大会和欢迎宴会
    据新华社安东16日电　今天下午，中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团在安东举行盛大的中国人民欢迎志愿军归国大会。
    参加大会的有，代表团团长陈叔通，副团长王维舟、邵力子、高崇民、李烛尘和全体代表团团员，辽宁省、安东市党政军负责人和安东市各界人民一万多人。
    主席台上悬挂着毛泽东主席、金日成首相的巨幅画像和中朝两国国旗。
    下午一时，当凯旋归来的英雄们进入会场时，全场响起鞭炮声、锣鼓声和欢呼声。会场上放出了无数的各色小气球，升起了挂有“欢迎中国人民志愿军光荣归国”等大字标语的大气球。
    当代表团全体人员陪同首批归国志愿军部队首长张天云中将、王明昆少将、谢福林少将和官兵代表走上主席台时，全场再一次响起雷鸣般的掌声。
    大会在中朝两国国歌声中开始。代表团团长、中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席陈叔通致欢迎词。他代表中国共产党、各人民团体、各民主党派和全国人民向劳苦功高的志愿军英雄们表示热烈的欢迎，并致亲切的慰问。（详见第二版）
    朝鲜驻我国大使馆临时代办文在洙也在会上讲了话。他代表大使馆向在保卫朝鲜人民的自由独立和远东和平的斗争中而建立了伟大功勋的志愿军归国部队和积极支援朝鲜前线的安东市人民以及全中国人民转达朝鲜人民的深切的谢意。文在洙说，朝鲜的分裂局面的根源，就在于美国侵略军驻在南朝鲜美国的侵略政策。所以，全体朝鲜人民强硬地要求美国军队和其他一切外国军队全部从南朝鲜撤出去。
    代表团团员、辽宁省副省长张雪轩，在讲话中首先介绍了辽宁省人民超额完成了第一个五年计划的成就。然后他说：辽宁省广大人民群众正以无比的热烈心情，殷切地盼望着你们来给他们讲述抗美援朝斗争的英勇事迹，以便学习你们艰苦奋斗的精神，更鼓起社会主义建设大跃进的革命干劲。
    安东市市长殷永杰在讲话中说，安东市人民曾经受到美帝国主义侵略战火的威胁，因而更加认识到抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大意义。所以，全市人民不但积极支援了抗美援朝的斗争；而且在朝鲜战争胜利后，又在社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。
    中国人民志愿军首批归国部队首长张天云中将在致答词中说，当我们的火车驰过鸭绿江桥、踏上抚育和生长我们的国土时，我们的心情是无限的兴奋。他说，志愿军从入朝参战的头一天起，就一直努力争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，在朝鲜停战后，志愿军已经先后三次主动地从朝鲜撤回了十九个师。这次，在中朝两国政府发表了联合声明后，志愿军又从朝鲜开始撤出自己的部队，这就再一次向全世界证明了志愿军抗美援朝完全是正义的行动。他还代表全体官兵表示：祖国需要我们到哪里，我们就到哪里；祖国需要我们去做什么，就去做什么。保持祖国人民所给予我们的“最可爱的人”的光荣称号。（详见第二版）
    大会结束前，志愿军的代表，向中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团献礼。四名官兵代表把采自英雄阵地马良山、丁字山、老秃山上的金达莱花、石头、黑土和美国侵略军轰炸朝鲜和平村庄的炸弹皮，送给了代表团。张天云中将还把一柄朝鲜古剑，佩戴在陈叔通团长的身上。这柄古剑是平壤一位朝鲜老人的传家之宝，在这次志愿军离别朝鲜的时候，这位朝鲜老人送给了张天云中将。
    大会在雄壮的志愿军战歌声中结束。会后，安东市的人们，在广场上同凯旋归来的英雄们进行热烈的联欢。

    今天，安东全市悬灯结彩，高挂国旗。从鸭绿江到安东车站，到处都是欢迎标语。在一座面对鸭绿江的高大建筑物的墙上，写着远离数里都能看得见的两个大字——“欢迎”。
    上午十一点四十分，志愿军官兵们乘坐的火车驶过鸭绿江桥，穿过祖国为英雄们搭起的凯旋门。在火车的车厢上写着：“祖国的儿女回来了”。这时，江南岸朝鲜人民的欢送声未落，江北岸上的锣鼓声、欢呼声又起。
    机车前悬挂毛主席、金日成画像。扎满鲜花的列车徐徐驶进车站时，爆发出一片欢呼声、口号声、鞭炮声和锣鼓声。车刚停稳，一群孩子举着鲜花，跑进车厢，高喊：“志愿军叔叔好！”
    被朝鲜人民称呼为“活罗盛教”的黄治富等志愿军战士请中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团团员许广平签字，许广平把黄治富拥抱起来，又把一个归国战士送给她的红领巾，系在黄治富的脖子上。
