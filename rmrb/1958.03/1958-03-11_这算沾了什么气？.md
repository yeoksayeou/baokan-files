A responsible comrade from the Aviation Survey Office of the Ministry of Railways once said this: "We must have what others have; we must also have what others don't have." At first glance, this sounds like a bold statement. Readers will surely assume that they are encouraging themselves: to be more energetic than others, to have a stronger will to overcome difficulties by paving roads through mountains and building bridges across rivers, and to implement the policy of building the country with greater, faster, better and more economical results more resolutely than others... But none of this is the case. What they want to have more than others is various equipment in their work and even in their lives, and everything must be good. The reason is: they are new, modern units that we have never had before. This is a new logic: engaging in modern work requires higher and more modern living than others. With the rapid advancement of our construction undertakings, we will have more and more new, modern units that we have never had before. Should comrades engaged in these jobs have such privileges in life and work? Is demanding such privileges a bit extravagant and spoiled? It is hoped that the Aviation Survey Office will hold a big debate in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign to find an answer.

    这算沾了什么气？
    铁道部航空勘测事务处的一位负责同志曾经说过这么一句话：别人有的，我们要有；别人没有的，我们也要有。乍听来，这像是一句豪语。读者们也一定会以为这是他们在勉励自己：要比别人干劲大些，逢山开路遇水搭桥的克服困难的毅力要比别人强些，执行多快好省勤俭建国方针比别人更坚决些……。其实都不是，他们要比别人多的是工作上以致生活上的各种设备，而且样样都要好的。原因是：他们是我们过去所没有过的新的现代化的事业单位。这是一个新逻辑：从事现代化的工作就得有比别人更高的更现代化的生活。随着我们建设事业的突飞猛进，我们过去所没有过的新的现代化的事业单位将要越来越多。从事这些工作的同志在生活上工作上究竟应不应该有这样的特权，要求这种特权的是不是沾了点阔气和娇气，希望航空勘测事务处在反浪费反保守运动中来一个大辩论，找出一个答案。
