Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 22nd: Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, stated at a mass rally in Suhl on the 21st, welcoming the Hungarian Party and Government delegation: The Adenauer government's decision to arm the West German army with atomic weapons is an attempt to present the upcoming summit with a fait accompli, thereby obstructing and sabotaging the meeting. He believes that countries threatened by West German militarism will quickly take countermeasures.

Grotewohl reiterated that the government of the German Democratic Republic has always believed that contentious issues can only be resolved through negotiations. Therefore, it fully supports the Soviet proposal to convene a summit, fully agrees with the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and supports the Soviet proposal to include the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, with the participation of both Germanies, on the agenda of international negotiations. At the same time, he stated that the people of the German Democratic Republic "have sufficient determination and powerful strength to defeat the aggressors. The entire socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, stands on our side."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 22nd: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Dvořák emphasized on the 21st that the Soviet government's proposals regarding prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes and abolishing foreign military bases on the territories of other countries are of great significance.

Dvořák made these remarks at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly. He said that Czechoslovakia supports the idea of convening a high-level meeting. It will make every effort to ensure the success of the foreign ministers' meeting and the high-level meeting, and if it is invited, it is prepared to participate in these meetings. Dvořák pointed out that Czechoslovakia fully agrees with the Soviet position and rejects the provocative demand of the United States to include the so-called issue of Eastern European countries on the agenda.

Dvořák pointed out that it is necessary to take a constructive attitude towards the issue of German reunification. He said that the Adenauer government's unreasonable insistence on discussing internal German issues at the summit is simply intended to complicate the convening of this meeting, while refusing the only possible solution to the German problem.

    格罗提渥重申支持苏联和平倡议
    指责西德决定装备原子武器破坏谈判
    戴维表示捷准备参加外长和高级会议
    据新华社柏林22日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥21日在苏尔举行的欢迎匈牙利党和政府代表团的群众集会上说：阿登纳政府决定用原子武器武装西德军队，这是打算使将要举行的最高级会议面对既成事实，从而阻挠和破坏这次会议。他相信受到西德军国主义威胁的各国会迅速采取反措施。
    格罗提渥重申，德意志民主共和国政府一向认为，只能通过谈判的途径来解决有争执的问题。因此，它完全支持苏联关于召开最高级会议的建议，完全赞成建立中欧无原子武器区的计划和苏联提出的在两个德国的参加下把缔结对德和约问题列入国际谈判议程的建议。同时，他表示，德意志民主共和国人民“有足够的决心和强大的力量来击败侵略者。以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营是站在我们一边的”。
    据新华社布拉格22日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维21日强调指出，苏联政府关于禁止把宇宙空间用于军事目的和取消在其他国家领土上的外国军事基地的建议具有重大意义。
    戴维是在国民议会外交委员会会议上讲这番话的。他说，捷克斯洛伐克支持召开高级会议的主张。它将尽一切努力使外长会议和高级会议成功，并且如果它被邀请，它准备参加这些会议。戴维指出，捷克斯洛伐克完全同意苏联的立场，拒绝美国主张把所谓东欧国家问题列入议程的挑衅性要求。
    戴维指出必须对统一德国问题持建设性的态度。他说，阿登纳政府无理坚持在高级会议上讨论德国内部问题，无非是有意使这个会议的召开复杂化，同时拒绝对德国问题唯一可能的解决办法。
