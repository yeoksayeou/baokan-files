On the Cotton Production Front

    Hubei Demands Doubling Production
    (Our dispatch) Hubei Province demands that the area of cotton fields with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, the number of townships with 100 jin of ginned cotton, and the number of co-ops with 100 jin of ginned cotton all be more than doubled compared to last year. However, judging from the progress of cotton-producing counties, they have exceeded the province's requirements. Macheng County guarantees that the average per-mu yield of ginned cotton for the entire county's cotton fields in 1958 will be 130 jin, striving for 150 jin, and will cultivate 10,000 mu of high-yield fields with a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton, and has challenged all brother counties in the province. More than forty counties in the province have successively proposed striving to become counties with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton in 1958, and the Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou regions are striving to become regions with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton.

    Zhejiang to Become a "Hundred Jin" Province This Year
    (Our dispatch) Zhejiang Province has put forward the slogan of achieving a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton province nine years ahead of schedule. In 1958, it plans to plant 1.14 million mu of cotton, with a total cotton output of 1.14 million dan, an average per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of 28.2% compared to last year. Cixi County's target for 1958 is: 480,000 mu of cotton fields, guaranteeing a per-mu yield of 150 jin of ginned cotton. The Cixi County four-level cadre conference resolved to respond to the challenge from Macheng, Hubei, and put forward friendly competitions to Shijiazhuang City in Hebei Province, Dunhuang in Gansu Province, Xinzhou in Hubei Province, and Xiaoshan, Yuyao, and Shangyu in Zhejiang Province.

    Hebei Striving for Eight Million Dan
    (Our dispatch) In order to organize a leap forward in grain and cotton production, Hebei Province has raised the unit area yield of cotton from the original 45 jin to 50 jin, striving for 60 jin, with a total output of 8 million dan of ginned cotton, an increase of 27.5% compared to last year.

    Henan Establishes "Guaranteed Production Zone"
    (Our dispatch) Henan Province has established a 4.5 million mu cotton guaranteed production zone, requiring the unit area yield of the guaranteed production zone to increase from 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu to 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, guaranteeing a total harvest of 2.92 million dan of ginned cotton. On one-third of the province's cotton fields, it is necessary to guarantee the production of three-quarters of the total output of ginned cotton, and at the same time, it is also required to drive the increase in production of all cotton fields by more than 20%.

    Shandong Guarantees Output of 4.8 Million Dan of Cotton
    (Our dispatch) Shandong Province's cotton production plan for 1958 guarantees a total output of 4.8 million dan, striving to reach 5.35 million dan, an increase of 29.7% compared to last year. In order to realize a great leap forward in grain and cotton production, the province has expanded its irrigated area by 14.5 million mu. The province has organized 2.86 million mu of cotton fields with a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton, and six counties and cities plan to become counties with 100 jin of ginned cotton. Gaotang County, with 500,140 mu of cotton, plans to leap forward from last year's per-mu yield of 52 jin of ginned cotton to more than 100 jin of ginned cotton.
