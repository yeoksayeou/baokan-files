Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Chinese Writers Association held a Great Leap Forward symposium on literary criticism work on the 10th, and had a heated discussion on the "Thirty-Two Articles on the Great Leap Forward in Literary Work" (draft) proposed by the Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association and how to develop literary criticism work.

Those attending the meeting included Lin Mohan, Zhang Guangnian, Mao Xing, Li Jianwu, Bian Zhilin, Sun Dingguo, Chen Xiaoyu, Yuan Shuipai, and dozens of others. The meeting was presided over by Shao Quanlin, who gave a brief explanation of the status and tasks of literary criticism. He said: In the past few years, literary criticism has made significant achievements in developing Marxist literary theory and criticizing bourgeois literary thought. In particular, the great victories achieved since last year in the struggle against right-wing elements in literary and art circles and the criticism of revisionist ideas have fully prepared the conditions for the current Great Leap Forward in literature. The main tasks of current literary criticism are: first, to strengthen the work of reviewing works in order to encourage and assist creation; second, to continue to criticize revisionist ideas, while overcoming dogmatism, and further improve Marxist literary theory. The overall goal is to prosper creation. In simple terms, it is to water flowers on one hand and weed on the other. In order to develop criticism work, it is necessary to establish and expand the ranks of critics, and lead the way in mobilizing all critical forces. Critics and writers should help each other, and writers should also write criticism, so that the forces will be greater. In terms of the methods of criticism, we should strive for innovation, break with conventions, dare to raise new questions, and dare to express original ideas. We must grasp both ends and drive the middle. There should be more comprehensive and profound critical articles, and even more short, concise, and diverse critical articles. The scope of criticism should be broad, but it should focus on reviewing current works. The writing style of criticism should advocate accuracy, clarity, and vividness, and oppose pretentiousness and emptiness. The Writers Association should also help critics go to life frequently, provide critics with necessary materials, and organize discussion meetings and report meetings for them.

During the discussion, everyone unanimously expressed their support for the thirty-two draft articles proposed by the Writers Association, and many people put forward their own plans on the spot. Zhang Geng said that the drama criticism aspect plans to establish thirty criticism groups to ensure that every play is reviewed. Criticism work should be linked to reality and the masses, and should not be "snow in the spring sun," or "highbrow and few in number." Writing should be short and easy to understand. In addition to completing the writing of the history of drama, he personally will write ten reviews and conduct a special study. Mao Xing said that the Institute of Literature plans to establish a contemporary literature research group to systematically conduct reviews and research on contemporary works. Li Jianwu, Bian Zhilin, Wang Shuming, Zhang Bilai, and others all said that in addition to doing a good job in translation and research, they will definitely strive to write more reviews. Li Xifan expressed his willingness to respond to Yao Wenyuan's challenge and write twenty reviews a year. Chen Yading said that the military is also preparing to establish a criticism team of twenty or thirty people, and he personally will write more than ten reviews. Jia Ji said that the film industry should also establish criticism groups and cooperate with newspapers and periodicals to vigorously develop film criticism. Shao Quanlin, Zhang Guangnian, Lin Mohan, and Zhang Bilai also put forward their own plans to achieve the goals called for by the Writers Association. Zhang Guangnian said that the two guidelines of the Wenyi Bao (Literature and Art News) are: to carry out a great debate on literary and artistic thought and to strengthen the review of new works. Lin Mohan pointed out that literary and artistic thought must be both "broken" and "established." We must promote the development of socialist literature and clarify the ideological confusion caused by revisionists in the past through reviews of works. Sun Dingguo, deputy director of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Office of the Advanced Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, proposed that to develop criticism work, it is first necessary to clarify the development of Marxist theory and implement the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature. Critics must have a broad mind and a correct worldview, which is a fundamental issue.

    发动一切文学评论力量
    浇花锄草　繁荣创作
    新华社12日讯　中国作家协会于10日举行了文学评论工作大跃进座谈会，就中国作家协会书记处提出的“文学工作大跃进三十二条”（草案）及如何发展文学评论工作问题展开了热烈讨论。
    出席会议的有林默涵、张光年、毛星、李健吾、卞之琳、孙定国、陈笑雨、袁水拍等数十人。会议由邵荃麟主持，他对文学评论工作的状况和任务作了简要说明。他说：过去几年来，文学评论工作在发展马克思主义文艺理论，批判资产阶级文艺思想的斗争中取得了重大成绩。特别是去年以来，对文艺界右派分子的斗争和对修正主义思想批判所取得的巨大胜利，为目前文学大跃进准备了充分的条件。当前文学评论的主要任务，一是加强作品评论工作，以鼓励和帮助创作；一是继续对修正主义思想进行批判，同时克服教条主义，进一步提高马克思主义的文艺理论，总的目的是为了繁荣创作。用简单的两句话说，就是一面浇花，一面除草。为了发展评论工作，需要建立和扩大评论队伍，有领导地放手发动一切评论力量。要求评论家和作家互助合作，作家也来写评论，这样力量就大了。在评论工作的方法上，努力革新，打破常规，敢于提出新的问题，敢于发表创见，要抓住两头，带动中间。要有比较全面深刻的评论文章，更要有大量的短小精悍、形式多样的评论文章。评论的范围应该广阔，但要以评论当前的作品为主。评论的文风应当提倡准确性、鲜明性、生动性，反对装腔作势、言之无物。作家协会还应该帮助评论家经常到生活中去，供给评论家以必要的资料和为他们组织讨论会、报告会。
    在讨论中，大家一致表示赞同作协提出的三十二条草案，许多人当场提出自己的规划。张庚说，戏剧评论方面准备成立三十个评论组，做到每戏必评。评论工作应该联系实际，联系群众，不要阳春白雪、曲高和寡。要写得短，写得通俗，他个人除完成话剧史的写作外，还要写十篇评论，和进行一项专题研究。毛星说，文学研究所准备成立一个当代文学研究组，有计划地进行对当代作品的评论与研究。李健吾、卞之琳、王淑明、张毕来等都表示在做好翻译和研究工作外，一定争取时间多写评论。李希凡表示愿意响应姚文元的挑战，一年写出评论二十篇。陈亚丁说，部队方面也准备成立一个二、三十人的评论队伍，他个人要写出十多篇评论。贾霁说，电影界也要建立评论小组和报刊合作，大力发展影评工作。邵荃麟、张光年、林默涵、张毕来也都提出自己的规划，要达到作协号召的目标。张光年说，文艺报的两条方针，就是：开展文艺思想大辩论和加强评论新作品。林默涵指出文艺思想上要“破”，也要“立”，要通过作品评论，促进社会主义文学的发展，澄清修正主义者过去所造成的思想混乱。中共中央高级党校哲学教研室副主任孙定国提出，发展评论工作首先要明确发展马克思主义理论，贯彻文学为工农兵服务方向。评论家要有宽阔的胸襟，要有正确的世界观，这是根本性的问题。
