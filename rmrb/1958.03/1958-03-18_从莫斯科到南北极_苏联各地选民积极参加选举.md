From Moscow to the North and South Poles
Voters Across the Soviet Union Actively Participate in Elections

Xinhua News Agency, 17th. TASS reports that on the 16th, voters across the Soviet Union participated in the election of the Supreme Soviet with a high degree of political enthusiasm. According to materials received by the Central Election Commission, from the start of voting at six in the morning until six in the afternoon, almost all voters across the country had cast their ballots.

The election was conducted separately in 1,364 electoral districts. Due to time differences, dawn in the Far East regions of the Soviet Union comes earlier than in the western regions. When it was still deep night in Moscow, voters on the Chukchi Peninsula, the easternmost part of the Soviet Union, had already begun voting. Sakhalin Island, Magadan, Yakutia, and other regions in the Far East also started voting very early.

The villages of Mirny, Novy, and Schastlivy in Yakutia held elections for the highest state authority for the first time, because these villages had not yet been established when the fourth election was held four years ago. Many voters searching for diamonds in Yakutia set off early on the 16th to participate in the election in the Novy constituency. The staff of state-owned farms established in the eastern reclamation areas in recent years also enthusiastically cast their ballots.

Moscow voters actively fulfilled their civic responsibilities. By six o'clock in the afternoon, 99.57% of all voters had participated in the voting. Voting in Dubna, a scientific town near Moscow, was basically completed by two o'clock in the afternoon. Staff from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research participated in the election here.

Preliminary results from Leningrad and the capitals of the Soviet republics show that voting was also conducted in an orderly manner, with high political enthusiasm among the working people. By six o'clock in the afternoon, 99.7% of voters in Leningrad had voted, and 99.9% of voters in Kiev had voted.

Soviet ships sailing in oceans around the world also reported the enthusiastic progress of the elections via radio. The captain of the "Dmitry Pozharsky" reported from Mumbai, India, that all crew members on the ship had cast their ballots by 6:30 in the morning.

Soviet scientists engaged in scientific expeditions in the Antarctic and Arctic regions also successfully conducted elections.

    从莫斯科到南北极
    苏联各地选民积极参加选举
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联各地的选民在16日以高度的政治积极性参加了苏联最高苏维埃的选举。根据中央选举委员会得到的材料，从上午六时开始投票以后，到下午六时，几乎全国所有的选民都投了票。
    这次选举是在一千三百六十四个选区分别进行的。由于时差的关系，苏联远东地区的黎明比西部地区来得早。当莫斯科还是夜深的时候，苏联最东部的楚克奇半岛的选民已经开始投票了。库页岛、马加丹、雅库特和远东其他地区也很早就开始投票。
    雅库特的和平村、新村和快乐村等村庄都是第一次举行国家最高权力机关的选举，因为在四年以前举行第四届选举的时候，这些村庄还没有建立起来。在雅库特探寻金刚石的许多选民16日一清早就动身到新村选区参加选举。最近几年在东部开垦地区建立起来的国营农场的工作人员也热情地投了票。
    莫斯科的选民积极地履行了他们的公民职责。下午六时，参加投票的选民就已占全部选民的99.57％。莫斯科近郊的科学城镇杜布纳的投票在下午二时就基本上结束了。联合原子核研究所的工作人员在这里参加了选举。
    列宁格勒和苏联各加盟共和国首都的选举初步结果表明，投票也是在秩序良好的、劳动人民高涨的政治热情中进行的。到下午六时，列宁格勒已经有99.7％的选民投了票，基辅有99.9％的选民投了票。
    在世界各个海洋上航行的苏联船只也通过无线电报告热烈进行选举的情况。“德米特里·波日阿尔斯基号”轮船船长从印度孟买报告说，这个轮船上所有的船员在上午六点三十分就全部投了票。
    在南极和北极地区进行科学考察工作的苏联科学家们也胜利地进行了选举。
