    "Dangerous Times"
    An American plane crashed and dropped an atomic bomb on its own territory. Fortunately, it didn't explode. However, US Secretary of Defense McElroy said: "In these dangerous times, we have no intention of stopping training flights with planes carrying atomic bombs."
    What is meant by "dangerous times"? Allowing planes carrying atomic bombs to fly day and night over one's own territory and the territory of others, placing a destructive catastrophe at the mercy of a pilot's momentary lapse, isn't this the greatest danger? Creating danger themselves, and then using "dangerous times" as an excuse not to eliminate this danger, this is precisely why war-mongers are war-mongers.

    “危险的时代”
    美国飞机失事，把一枚原子弹扔到自己的国土上了，没有爆炸，总算万幸。然而美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊却说：“在这种危险的时代，决不打算停止载有原子弹的飞机的训练飞行”。
    什么叫作“危险的时代”？让带着原子弹的飞机昼夜飞行在自己的国土上和别人的国土上，让一场毁灭性的灾难，系于飞行员的一念之差，这难道不是最大的危险？自己制造了危险，而又借口“危险的时代”，不想取消这种危险，此战争贩子之所以为战争贩子也。
