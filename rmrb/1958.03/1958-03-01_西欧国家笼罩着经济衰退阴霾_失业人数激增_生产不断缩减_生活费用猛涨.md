Xinhua News Agency dispatch from London: The shadow of economic recession and unemployment is threatening Britain and many countries in Western Europe.

According to statistics, the number of registered unemployed in Britain has risen monthly from 266,000 at the end of August last year to 423,000 in mid-February this year. The number of registered partially unemployed has risen from 59,000 at the end of November last year to 80,000 in mid-January this year. The "Financial Times" pointed out that the "tendency for the number of unemployed to continue to increase is becoming increasingly strong."

According to reports, unemployment in Britain is increasing not only in sectors that are heavily affected by seasonal factors (such as the construction industry), but also in some major economic sectors such as coal mining, steel, transportation, fishing, and shipping. Unemployment is most severe in the construction industry and tinplate manufacturing (with 50,000 unemployed construction workers). There have also been layoffs in shipbuilding, ship repair, and machine tool manufacturing.

The increase in unemployment is related to the continuous reduction in production. The "Financial Times" wrote, "Many industrial sectors in Britain have felt increasing difficulty in sales in recent weeks… the overall picture suggests a gradual economic decline."

Unemployment is also increasing in some other Western European countries.

Although France maintains a large colonial army in Algeria, the number of registered unemployed in early February still increased by 15% compared to January, reaching 100,148.

In Belgium, the number of registered unemployed in January this year was 114,993, an increase of 30% compared to January last year.

In the Netherlands, the number of registered unemployed in early February was 129,966, more than double the number a year ago.

In West Germany, the number of registered unemployed in early January was 1,432,067, accounting for 7.4% of the employed population in West Germany.

In Austria, the number of registered unemployed at the end of January was 200,9,233, accounting for nearly 10% of the employed population, an increase of nearly 30% compared to a year ago.

In Italy, there is still an army of 2 million unemployed.

In Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, the number of registered unemployed has also increased compared to a year ago.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Bonn: Many industrial sectors in West Germany continued to stagnate in the first two months of this year. Some industries have already shown signs of recession.

According to newspaper reports, a decrease in export orders is a direct cause of this trend in the West German economy. According to the official report of the West German Ministry of Economic Affairs, the export orders received by West German factories in January this year were 7% less than in January last year.

Steel factories and mines in the West German Ruhr area have already scaled down production. Many factories are only able to allow workers to work 32 hours a week due to insufficient orders. The number of workers with "insufficient working hours" has increased from 30,000 in December last year to 45,000.

In the port of Hamburg, as many as 75 merchant ships (totaling 250,000 tons) were idled on the 26th alone due to the shipping industry's slump.

The stock prices of important West German factories have also fallen one after another under the threat of economic recession. Stocks in the steel and coal mining industries fell in price by 2% to 6% in one week in late February.

Combined report from this newspaper. Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The cost of living in major capitalist countries is constantly rising. The U.S. government announced on the 25th that the official cost-of-living index rose to a new high in January this year. This is the fifteenth price increase in the past seventeen months. If the average price of 1947-49 is 100, the "consumer price index" for January this year is 122.5, up 3.3% from a year ago. The price of various meats rose by 4% in January, and food (retail price) rose by 1.8%.

According to the British "Financial Times": In the past twelve months, prices in Britain have increased by 4.5%, Belgium by 3%, Denmark by 5.5%, and the Netherlands by 13%.

According to materials from Western economic departments, the cost-of-living index in West Germany in January this year was 4.2% higher than in the same period last year, with clothing and food prices rising the fastest, up 5.5% and 5% respectively.

According to the French "L'Humanité": The cost of living in France has risen by more than 15% in the past year. Among them, food prices rose by 15%, beverages by 27%, rent by 15%, transportation by 10%, and entertainment by 20%. "L'Humanité" said that the French government's measure to devalue the franc by 20% in August last year will also cause new price increases.

    西欧国家笼罩着经济衰退阴霾
    失业人数激增　生产不断缩减　生活费用猛涨
    据新华社讯　伦敦消息：经济衰退和失业的阴影正在威胁着英国和西欧许多国家。
    据统计，英国登记的失业人数从去年8月底的二十六万六千人逐月上升到今年2月中的四十二万三千人。登记的半失业者的数目从去年11月底的五万九千人上升到今年1月中的八万人。“金融时报”指出，失业人数“继续增长的倾向日益加强”。
    据报道，目前英国不仅在一些受季节影响大的部门（如建筑业）中失业人数增长，而且在采煤、钢铁、交通运输、渔业和航运业等一些主要经济部门中，失业也在增长。在建筑业和马口铁制造业中，失业现象最为严重（建筑工人失业者达五万人）。造船、船只修理和工作母机制造业等部门也有工人被解雇。
    失业的增长同生产的不断缩减有关。“金融时报”写道，“英国许多工业部门近几个星期来都感到销售困难日益增加……总的景象说明经济逐渐衰落。”
    在其他一些西欧国家中，失业也在增长。
    法国虽然在阿尔及利亚维持着一支庞大的殖民军，2月初登记的失业人数还是比1月份增加了15％，达到十万零一百四十八人。
    在比利时，今年1月份登记的失业人数是十一万四千九百九十三人，比去年1月份增加了30％。
    在荷兰，2月初登记的失业人数是十二万九千九百六十六人，比一年前增加了一倍多。
    在西德，1月初登记的失业人数是一百四十三万二千零六十七人，占西德就业人数的7.4％。
    在奥地利，1月底登记的失业人数是二十万零九千二百三十三人，占就业人数的将近10％，比一年前增加了将近30％。
    在意大利，目前仍然保持着一支二百万人的失业大军。
    在丹麦、挪威、瑞典和芬兰，登记的失业人数也都比一年前有增加。
    据新华社讯　波恩消息：西德许多工业部门今年头两个月继续处在停滞状态。某些行业已经显出衰退的征象。
    据报纸报道，出口定货减少是促成西德经济这种趋势的直接原因。根据西德经济部的官方报告，今年1月西德各工厂所得到的出口货定货，比去年1月少7％。
    西德鲁尔区的钢铁工厂和矿井已经在缩小生产规模。不少工厂由于开工不足，每星期只能让工人做工三十二小时。“工时不足”的工人的数目已经从去年12月的三万人增加到四万五千人。
    汉堡港内仅在26日就有七十五艘商船（共二十五万吨）由于航运业萧条而闲置起来。
    西德重要工厂的股票价格也在经济衰退的威胁下接连下跌。钢铁业和采煤业的股票在2月下旬的一个星期里跌价2％到6％。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：资本主义世界主要国家的生活费用正在不断上涨。美国政府25日宣布，官方的生活费用指数在今年1月又上涨到新的高峰。这是过去十七个月来的第十五次涨价。如以1947—49年的平均价格为一百，今年一月的“消费者物价指数”则为一百二十二点五。比一年前上涨3.3％。各种肉类价格在1月份上涨了4％，食品（零售价格）上涨了1.8％。
    据英国“金融时报”报道：在最近十二个月来，英国物价提高4.5％，比利时3％，丹麦5.5％，荷兰13％。
    据西方经济部材料，今年1月西德生活指数比去年同期高4.2％，其中衣着和食品价格上涨最快，分别上涨了5.5％和5％。
    另据法国“人道报”报道：法国在过去一年中生活费用上涨15％以上。其中食品价格上涨15％，饮料27％，房租15％，交通10％，娱乐20％。“人道报”说，法国政府去年8月采取的法郎贬值20％的措施还会引起新的物价上涨。
