Eastern Scales and Western Claws

    Using Tree Bark to Make Cotton
    Recently, workers at the Fuzhou Textile Factory successfully produced artificial cotton using paper mulberry bark. Every hundred catties of paper mulberry bark can produce sixty to seventy catties of artificial cotton. The fiber length and tensile strength are similar to natural cotton, and the cost is cheaper than the market price of cotton. Currently, they have produced more than 300 catties and spun it into yarn.
    Northern Fujian Province is rich in paper mulberry trees, and 150,000 dan of bark can be harvested each year. If all of it is used to make artificial cotton, it can produce about 100,000 dan per year.

    400,000 Catties of Kangning Milk Powder
    The "Kangning Milk Powder" produced by the Xining Kangersu Dairy Factory will increase by more than double this year compared to last year.
    Last year, this factory actually produced more than 90,000 kilograms of milk powder, and this year's original plan was to produce 150,000 kilograms. After discussion by the workers, everyone believed that the factory's machinery and equipment had great production potential and good technical conditions. In the past, the inability to increase production more was mainly due to the dispersed milk sources, inconvenient transportation, and insufficient milk supply. Now the number of milk collection stations and points has increased from more than a dozen in the past to twenty-five, and it is fully capable of producing 200,000 kilograms of milk powder.

    Previously Imported, Now Exported
    The magnesium chloride produced by the local state-owned Wenzhou Chemical Factory has improved in quality to 96% magnesium content. Recently, the China National Import and Export Corporation ordered 100 tons from this factory to be shipped abroad. In the past, China's construction industry needed to import magnesium chloride from the United Kingdom, but now it has begun to be sold abroad. (Wang Shaochu)
    "Kongming Lantern"
    The Yuan Dynasty White Pagoda (commonly known as the Kongming Lantern), which was dismantled during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, has now been restored by the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau. The new White Pagoda is built on the top of Snake Hill, a little past the Wuchang bridgehead, and its grandeur is the same as before the relocation.
    Soon, after the pagoda body is decorated, railings are added around the pagoda, and the surrounding slopes are filled, it will be open for tourists to visit.

    用树皮制棉花
    福州纺织厂职工最近用构树皮制造人造棉成功。每百斤构树皮能制出六十斤到七十斤人造棉，纤维长度和拉力都和天然棉花差不多，成本比棉花市价便宜。现在，他们已经制出三百多斤，并纺成了纱。
    福建省北部山区盛产构树，每年可以采割十五万担树皮；如果都用来制造人造棉，每年可以制出十万担左右。

    四十万斤康宁奶粉
    西宁康尔素乳品厂的“康宁奶粉”，今年将比去年增加一倍以上。
    这个厂去年实际生产奶粉九万多公斤，今年原计划生产十五万公斤。经过职工讨论后，大家认为厂里机器设备的生产潜力很大，技术条件也好，过去不能多增产，主要是奶源分散，交通不便，牛奶供应不上。现在收奶站、点已由过去的十几处增加到二十五处，完全有条件生产二十万公斤奶粉。

    过去进口现在出口
    地方国营温州化工厂生产的氯化镁，质量提高到含镁96％。最近中国进出口公司向这个厂订购一百吨运往国外。过去我国建筑工业需用氯化镁要由英国进口，现在开始外销了。　（王少初）
    “孔明灯”
    修建武汉长江大桥时拆下的元代白塔（俗名孔明灯），现在已由武汉大桥工程局修复。新白塔建在武昌桥头过去一点的蛇山顶上，其壮观和拆迁前一样。
    不久，等塔身粉饰完毕，塔的周围加上栏杆，四周的地坡一填平，就可供游人观赏了。
