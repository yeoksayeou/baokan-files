Why?

    "Spring Sleep Brings Unawareness of Dawn"
    There is a famous line in Tang poetry, "Spring sleep brings unawareness of dawn." From a scientific point of view, this line is also quite accurate. The reasons are: First, spring nights are shorter than winter nights, so waking up from the same sleep, it is still dark in winter, but it is already bright in spring. Second, with the warmth of spring and blooming flowers, everyone is willing to go outdoors for activities. This will promote blood circulation, which will also bring a slight pressure to the brain. This pressure is an inhibitory stimulus, that is to say, the activity of the cerebral cortex gradually tends to an inhibited state, thus there is a feeling of "sleepiness." When this inhibitory state spreads to all parts of the cortex, people also have feelings such as eye astringency, weak limbs, heavy head, and all-over laziness. However, when the brain gradually gets used to this change, the feeling of sleepiness will gradually disappear. Therefore, the feeling of sleepiness is more obvious only when the weather suddenly warms up in spring. (Feng)

专栏：为什么？

    “春眠不觉晓”
    唐诗里有“春眠不觉晓”的名句。从科学的角度看，这句诗说得也很中肯。原因：一、春夜短于冬夜，因此同样一觉睡醒，在冬日，天还没亮，在春日，却已大亮了。二、春暖花开，谁都愿意到户外去活动活动。这就会促进血液循环，也就会带给大脑一种轻微的压力。这压力是一种抑制性的刺激，也就是说大脑皮层的活动慢慢地趋于抑制状态，于是便有了“困”的感觉。当这种抑制状态扩散到皮层的各个部分时，人还有眼睛发涩，四肢乏力，头重，混身发懒等感觉。但是，当大脑又逐渐习惯于这种改变以后，困的感觉也会渐渐消失。所以困的感觉只在春天天气骤然暖和的时候比较明显。　（风）
