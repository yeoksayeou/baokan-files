Stage and Screen

    Tianqiao Small Theater Musicians Take the Stage
    The soloists and instrumentalists of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra have recently made great strides. In addition to performing a series of shows in suburban factories, socializing and making friends with workers, and singing new works by workers, soloists Liu Shufang, violinist Situ Huacheng, and others held concerts at the Tianqiao Small Theater (Xiaotaoyuan) on the evenings of March 7th and 8th, introducing popular and easy-to-understand new songs, light music, and lyric pieces to the general public. This approach is highly commendable because, through performances in these small theaters, not only can the general public have the opportunity to appreciate new musical forms and enrich their cultural lives, but also enable our musicians to better serve the working masses.

    Thousands of Troops and Horses Engage in Water Conservancy
    The news documentary "The Great Leap Forward in the Countryside," Part 1, reflects the extraordinary winter that China's countryside is experiencing: people are striving for farmland water conservancy with an overwhelming momentum. The wisdom of the masses is endless, and new tools, new instruments, and new working methods are constantly being created. From the film, we see that farmers in the Taihang Mountains of Linxian County, Henan Province, formed their own surveying team, using wood chips, wooden sticks, and plates to create simple and practical levels to measure a canal route of more than 30 li, crossing eight high mountains. We also see how the people of Pingyuan County, Guangdong Province, opened up continuous cliffs of more than ten li to build canals; how they used wooden frames several feet high to support aqueducts, crossing forty-eight deep ravines, forcing the river water to obey the will of the people and irrigate 15,000 mu of fertile land. After watching this documentary, people will be more convinced that humans can overcome nature.
    Parts 2 and 3 of the film are being filmed and will focus on reporting on the breaking of conventions during the Spring Festival, the technical revolution, and the cultural revolution in rural areas.

      "Mother and Daughter Teachers"
    The Changchun Film Studio’s feature film "Mother and Daughter Teachers" portrays the conflict between two generations of mothers and daughters. However, the two generations of mothers and daughters are closely linked by the same ideal – the dedication to the people’s education.
    The film focuses on the relationship between the mother, Principal Shen, and her daughter, Lin Yueying. They are mother and daughter; moreover, Principal Shen is a lonely, elderly woman, and Lin Yueying is her only daughter, so the emotion between them is so unusual! However, Principal Shen has stopped moving forward in the face of life, and her self-confidence and pride make her treat students very roughly. It is at this critical moment that her daughter Yueying, who loves and respects her the most, comes forward to help her mother. Life educates and promotes Principal Shen.
    "Mother and Daughter Teachers" is simple and healthy, which are its strengths. However, the film focuses on writing about the teaching attitudes of two generations of mothers and daughters towards a child named Xiao Mao, the scope of life it touches is too narrow, and the characters' spiritual world is not rich or profound, which is a shortcoming.

    舞台与银幕
    天桥小剧场音乐家登台
    中央乐团的独唱家、独奏家，最近有很大的跃进，他们除到近郊工厂进行一系列的演出，和工人联欢、交朋友、演唱工人的新作品外，独唱家刘淑芳、小提琴家司徒华城等人，三月七、八两晚又到天桥小剧场（小桃园）举行音乐会，向一般群众介绍一些通俗易懂的新歌，轻音乐及抒情曲。这种做法值得大大的提倡，因为，通过在这些小剧场的演出，不但能使一般群众有机会欣赏新的音乐形式，丰富他们的文化生活；同时，也使我们的音乐家能够更好地为劳动群众服务。

    千军万马搞水利
    新闻纪录片“农村大跃进”第一辑反映了我国农村正在经历着的一个不平凡的冬天的情景：人们正以排山倒海的气魄为农田水利化而奋斗。群众的智慧无穷无尽，新工具、新仪器、新的工作方法正在不断地创造出来。从影片中，我们看到了河南林县太行山区的农民自己组成了测量队，他们用木片、木棍和盘子制成了简单适用的水平仪，靠它测定了一条三十多里长、越过八座高山的水渠线路。也看到了广东平远县的人民，如何凿开了连绵十余里的悬崖峭壁修渠道；如何用几丈高的木架支起水槽，跨过了四十八条深沟，使河水不得不服从人们的意志，灌溉了一万五千亩良田。看了这纪录片，人们将会更加相信：人一定能够战胜自然。
    影片第二辑、第三辑正拍摄中，将集中报道农村中打破常规过春节、技术革命、文化革命等情形。

      “母女教师”
    长影艺术片“母女教师”，写的是母女两代间的冲突。但母女两代是被同一个理想紧密联系着的——这就是对人民教育工作的献身热情。
    影片着重描写了母亲沈校长和女儿林月英的关系。她们是母女俩；而且，沈校长是个孤身的、上了年纪的妇女，林月英又是她唯一的女儿，这中间的感情是多么不平常啊！可是，沈校长在生活面前停步不前了，自信、骄傲，使她很粗暴地对待学生。正是在这个关键时刻，最爱她、最尊敬她的女儿月英，挺身出来帮助自己的母亲。生活教育和推动了沈校长。
    “母女教师”朴素、健康，是它的长处。但是，影片集中在写母女两代对待一个孩子小毛的教学态度上，接触的生活面过于窄小，人物的精神世界也不丰富、深刻，是一个缺点。　（文）
