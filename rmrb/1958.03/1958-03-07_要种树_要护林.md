    Plant Trees, Protect Forests
    Since Chairman Mao issued the call to green the motherland, various agencies, schools, and agricultural production cooperatives in Fengxian County, Jiangsu, have planted many trees. However, some units lack a sufficient understanding of the significance of greening the motherland, holding a purely task-oriented view, and after planting the saplings, they consider it "all done" and no longer pay attention to them. Some newly planted saplings have their heads broken off by mischievous children, some have their trunks broken by passing vehicles, some have their roots bitten off by pigs and sheep, and some have even disappeared without a trace, leaving only small pits behind. This not only wastes manpower and financial resources but also seriously affects the time for greening the motherland. Therefore, I suggest:
    (1) All agencies, schools, and agricultural cooperatives should strengthen the care of saplings to ensure that every tree planted lives, every patch planted thrives, and every area planted is protected.
    (2) Conduct extensive forestry protection education for the masses to make everyone consciously cherish trees.
    (3) In all afforestation areas, the masses can establish forestry protection organizations based on the amount of afforestation and democratically formulate forestry protection covenants.

### 要种树　要护林

    要种树　要护林
    自从毛主席提出绿化祖国的号召后，我们江苏丰县的各机关、学校和农业生产合作社都栽了很多树。但有的单位对绿化祖国的意义认识不足，抱着单纯的任务观点，把树苗栽上后就“万事大吉”不再过问了，一些刚刚栽上的树苗，有的就被顽皮的孩子折去了头，有的被来往的车辆碰断了腰，有的被猪羊咬断了根，甚至有的连树苗的影子也不见啦，只剩下一个个小坑在那里。这样不但人力和财力浪费了，并且严重地影响了绿化祖国的时间。因此，我建议：
    （1）各机关、学校和各农业社要加强对树苗的爱护，保证栽一棵、活一棵，活一片，保一片。
    （2）要广泛地向群众进行护林教育，让大家自觉地爱护树木。
    （3）各造林地区群众，可根据造林的多少，成立护林组织，并民主制订护林公约。
