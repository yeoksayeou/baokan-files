Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: By the 17th, 34 counties and cities nationwide had basically achieved the "Four-No's." These advanced "Four-No's" counties and cities belong to the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Shandong, Henan, Guizhou, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and others. Among them, Hebei Province has the best results, with 14 "Four-No's" counties and cities such as Lixian and Gaoyi, accounting for 8.6% of the province's 164 counties and cities. Second is Henan Province, with five "Four-No's" counties and cities such as Dengfeng and Shangqiu, accounting for 4% of the province's 124 counties and cities. At the Dengfeng Conference convened by the Henan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, which concluded on March 7, representatives from all special districts, counties, and cities in the province unanimously proposed the leap-forward goal of "Fighting hard for fifty days to strive to become the first 'Four-No's' province in the country and report the good news to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on May 1st."
The standards for each county and city to assess the "Four-No's" are not completely the same, but are roughly the same. The standards for general areas are roughly as follows:
	I. No Rats: No rat holes, rat tracks, or rat droppings; no rat sounds can be heard; bait or rat traps placed on roads frequently used by rats show no signs of rats eating or being caught after a certain period; all rats in rat holes in rural cultivated areas are eliminated; no new rat holes are discovered.
	II. No Sparrows: No sparrow nests, sparrow tracks, sparrow droppings, sparrow sounds, or stealing of food in any buildings in residential areas.
	III. No Flies: No adult flies indoors or outdoors; no maggots in fly breeding sites such as toilets, garbage heaps and garbage cans, manure pits and manure vats; all fly breeding sites have been treated to kill flies and no maggots or pupae are found.
	IV. No Mosquitoes: No adult mosquitoes indoors or outdoors; mosquito control has been carried out in overwintering mosquito habitats such as ditches; no weeds in sewage ponds, ponds, etc.; no mosquito larvae in mosquito breeding sites such as sewers, open drains, Taiping water pools, buckets, ponds, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhangzhou, March 18th: Zhangzhou City has basically eliminated six pests: rats, sparrows, flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, and fleas, becoming the first "Six-No's" health city in Fujian Province. This was announced by Wei Jinshui, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Fujian Provincial On-site Meeting for the Patriotic Health Campaign to Eliminate the Four Pests, which closed on the 16th.
According to inspections and evaluations, rat-infested households account for only 1.6% of the city, mosquitoes, flies, and sparrows are almost extinct, and fleas and bedbugs have been completely eliminated.
Zhangzhou City is located in the subtropics with abundant rainfall, and in the past, the six pests reproduced particularly quickly. In the movement to eliminate the six pests and promote hygiene, in addition to going deep into the grassroots to mobilize the masses and lead them to participate in the movement, the city's party and government leading organs also trained more than 3,200 grassroots health cadres and activists in eliminating the six pests, and organized more than 300 practicing doctors in the city to provide technical guidance on eliminating the six pests to citizens, thus enabling the movement to be carried out continuously and deeply. In the movement, the leadership also gradually turned the elimination of the six pests and the promotion of hygiene into a lifestyle habit for all people by organizing on-site observation and evaluation, and by exchanging experiences.

    全国34个县市基本实现“四无”
    漳州市成为“六无”卫生市
    据新华社18日讯　到17日为止，全国已有三十四个县市基本实现“四无”。这些先进的四无县市分别属于河北、山西、辽宁、吉林、山东、河南、贵州、安徽、浙江、福建、江西、四川等省。其中成绩最好的是河北省，已有蠡县、高邑等十四个“四无”县市，占全省一百六十四个县市的8.6％。其次是河南省，已有登封、商丘等五个县市实现“四无”，占全省一百二十四个县市的4％。在3月7日结束的中共河南省委召开的登封会议上，全省各专区、县、市代表一致提出“苦战五十天，争取全国第一个四无省，五一节向党中央、毛主席报喜”的跃进目标。
    各县市鉴定“四无”的标准不完全一样，但大致相同。一般地区的标准大概是这样：
    一、无鼠：没有鼠洞、鼠迹和它的粪便；听不见老鼠发出的声音；在老鼠常走的道路上放上食饵或鼠夹，经过一定时间没有发现有老鼠偷吃或上钩；农村耕作地区的鼠洞内老鼠全部消灭；不再发现新鼠洞。
    二、无雀：居民点一切建筑物内无雀窝、雀迹、雀粪、雀声和偷食食物现象。
    三、无蝇：室内外无成蝇，厕所、垃圾堆和垃圾箱、粪池和粪缸等处苍蝇繁育场所无蛆；所有苍蝇孳生场所全部经过灭蝇处理并且没有发现蛆和蛹。
    四、无蚊：室内外无成蚊；阳沟等越冬蚊栖息场所进行了灭蚊处理；污水塘、水塘等处无杂草；阴沟、阳沟、太平水池、水桶、池塘等蚊虫繁育场所无孑孓。
    据新华社漳州18日电　漳州市已基本消灭了老鼠、麻雀、苍蝇、蚊子、臭虫和跳蚤等六害，成为福建省第一个基本上达到“六无”的卫生市。这是中共福建省委书记魏金水在16日闭幕的福建省除四害爱国卫生运动观摩会上宣布的。
    据检查鉴定，全市有鼠户只占1.6％，蚊、蝇和麻雀几乎绝迹，跳蚤和臭虫已全部消灭。
    漳州市地处亚热带，雨水多，过去六害繁殖特别快。在除六害、讲卫生运动中，全市党政领导机关除了深入基层发动群众、带动群众投入运动外，还训练了三千二百多名卫生基层干部和除六害积极分子，组织了全市三百多个开业医生，对市民进行除六害的技术指导，因而使运动能持续不断地深入开展。在运动中，领导上又通过组织观摩评比交流经验等方法，把除六害、讲卫生逐步变成全民一种生活习惯。
