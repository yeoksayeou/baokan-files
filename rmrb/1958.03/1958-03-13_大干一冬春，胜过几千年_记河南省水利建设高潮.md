A Winter-Spring of Hard Work Surpasses Thousands of Years
--Record of the High Tide of Water Conservancy Construction in Henan Province
Wei Weiliang Yao Liwen

The growth of anything involves gradual changes and dramatic transformations, progressing from gradual development to a leap forward. This holds true for social revolution, as well as economic construction. The magnificent water conservancy construction movement that began last winter in Henan Province powerfully demonstrates this point.

Found the Correct Path to Water Management

Henan Province, located in the Central Plains, is home to five major mountain ranges, including Taihang, Funiu, Tongbai, Dabie, and Songshan, and four major rivers, including the Yellow River, Huai River, Wei River, and Tangbai River. The terrain is high in the northwest, flat in the central region, and low-lying in the southeast. Due to the complex topography and the fact that most of the annual rainfall is concentrated in July, August, and September, often in the form of torrential downpours, the province experiences drought in the winter and spring and flooding in the summer and autumn. According to more than two thousand years of historical records, Henan has suffered more than nine hundred water and drought disasters, severely impacting the development of agricultural and sideline production. People lived in great poverty. Suffering people often described their disastrous lives as "thin porridge in the morning, watery soup at noon, and thin gruel at night under the moonlight" or "famine after one season of poor harvest, and wandering after two seasons." According to relevant records, during the eight years of Kuomintang rule from 1937 to 1945, an average of about 800,000 farmers in the province died annually from water and drought disasters, freezing, and starvation, and nearly one million households were constantly on the brink of famine, displacement, and homelessness. Therefore, eradicating water and drought disasters, changing the face of nature, and developing agricultural production have become the aspirations of the people of Henan for thousands of years.

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the people of Henan in carrying out the work of harnessing the Yellow River and the Huai River, building five large reservoirs and seven large-scale projects for storing floodwater in low-lying areas, completing the reinforcement of the Yellow River dikes, and regulating more than a hundred river channels, preventing the Yellow River from breaching its banks for nine years and the Huai River from overflowing for eight years, greatly reducing the harm caused by floods. However, this has not fundamentally changed the face of nature. Every year, 30 million mu of crops in the province still suffer from floods, and an even larger area of crops is often affected by drought. Water and drought disasters continue to threaten the development of agricultural production. This is because in the early years after liberation, the Party and the government were leading the people in fully recovering from the wounds of war and carrying out social reforms. Water management and changing the face of nature were not yet on the agenda of the entire Party and all the people. It was also because water conservancy construction at that time only focused on a few large-scale projects undertaken by the state, relying on certain flood control and drainage projects at "points" and "lines" in various rivers, or simply relying on widening river channels and reinforcing dikes to resist floods. Although the annual flood disasters were reduced, the disasters of waterlogging and drought remained unresolved. At that time, the water management ideology of many responsible personnel in charge of water conservancy work was to focus on large-scale projects, state-run projects, drainage, and point-line management. They did not recognize the laws of "water" and lacked a comprehensive and profound understanding of the relationship between water and the production and lives of farmers. They had not yet seen the power of the masses and did not believe in the role of the masses in building small-scale projects. They even stipulated certain restrictive rules, restricting the water management activities of the broad masses, worrying that the masses would "mess things up."

However, the facts were deeply educational for people. For example, the Baisha Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Ying River was well built. From August 3rd to 4th, 1956, the Ying River basin received 250 millimeters of rainfall, and the Baisha Reservoir intercepted and stored more than 63 million cubic meters of floodwater, less than one-fourth of the reservoir's capacity, but the five counties of Yuxian, Xuchang, Changge, and Yanling downstream of the Baisha Reservoir were flooded with more than 2.2 million mu of land. Another example is the Hong River, a tributary of the Huai River. In recent years, the state invested 30 million yuan to dredge the river channel and reinforce the dikes. In August 1956, the entire basin received 200 to 250 millimeters of rainfall. Although the Shimantan Reservoir and Laowangpo intercepted more than 100 million cubic meters of floodwater, and the Hong River did not breach its banks, the internal waterlogging and rolling slope water in Xiping, Shangcai, Runan, Pingyu, and other counties flooded 7.79 million mu of land. The masses said: Only focus on guarding the dikes in front to prevent external floods, but the internal stagnant water flooded the rear.

Various facts show that only paying attention to large-scale projects while ignoring small-scale projects, only paying attention to drainage while ignoring water storage, only paying attention to relying on the state while ignoring relying on the masses, and only paying attention to point-line management while ignoring area management cannot eliminate water and drought disasters in the vast plains.

The situation in the mountainous areas is similar. Simply planting trees in isolation without comprehensive soil and water conservation work cannot control soil erosion. Soil erosion seriously affects the development of agriculture and forestry production in mountainous areas. Mountain farmers say: "The mountain is like a monk's head, the clear water flow stops, hoping for next year this year, and there will be no good harvest every year." The farmers of Jiuma Mountain in Yuxian County concluded that planting trees alone on barren mountains without soil and water conservation work leads to "green for one year, yellow for two years, and meeting the King of Hell in three years." They only saw trees planted every year, but no forests formed. Or they repaired terraced fields and built bank gullies year after year, only to have them collapse and be washed away year after year.

People urgently need to find the correct path for water and mountain management.

In the winter of 1955, driven by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the province launched its first mass water conservancy construction campaign. In six months, more than one million wells were dug, and the irrigated area was expanded by 24 million mu. This campaign initially demonstrated the great power of collective farmers, and the achievements were enormous. However, in this water management campaign, various regions did not pay enough attention to adapting to local conditions, and they had not yet fully grasped the laws of water management or found a comprehensive method for water management.

Two types of people adopted two different attitudes toward this mass water conservancy construction campaign. One type affirmed the achievements, summarized the experiences, learned the lessons, and went to the masses to actively find the correct path and method for solving comprehensive water management. The other type seized on certain shortcomings in the mass water management efforts, exaggerating them one-sidedly, or even completely negating mass water management. They said that "water conservancy construction has advanced too fast," that "water conservancy projects are technical work, and the masses cannot master them, so there should be no mass movements," that "small-scale projects built by the masses do not play a significant role," and so on.

Facts gave a resounding answer to the right-leaning conservatives who believed in large-scale projects, looked down on small-scale projects, only focused on flood control with large reservoirs, and looked down on water storage with mass small-scale projects.

The Party committee and government of Jiyuan County, located in the Mang River basin, led the masses, starting in 1954, using 2.5 million workdays over two winters and two springs, in the spirit of comprehensive management and comprehensive utilization, to complete 84 small reservoirs, build 80,000 mu of terraced fields, dig 6,565 water cellars, and afforest 22 mu, controlling soil erosion in an area of 870 square kilometers in the upper reaches of the Mang River. Under the condition that the rainfall in 1953 and 1956 was basically the same, the flood flow of the Mang River was reduced from 500 cubic meters per second to 70 cubic meters. The flooded area decreased from 110,000 mu to 30,000 mu, while the irrigated area increased by 200,000 mu, basically eliminating ordinary water and drought disasters in the Mang River basin. As a result, the total grain output of Jiyuan County increased from 98.18 million jin in 1953 to 197.82 million jin in 1956, more than doubling. Yuxian County at the foot of Song Mountain set an example for mountain management. Yuxian County learned from the experience of Daquanshan Mountain in Shanxi Province, and adopted measures suitable to local conditions, such as digging fish-scale pits, intercepting water ditches, contour lines, contour planting, and supplementing them with digging ponds and building small reservoirs, completely curing Jiuma Mountain and Caiping Mountain. In 1957, under the condition of a rainstorm of 122 millimeters of rainfall in seven hours, both mountains achieved no soil erosion and no water flowing down the mountain. After the flood season in 1957, the Xuchang Prefectural Water Conservancy Bureau sent an investigation team to Yuxian, Jiaxian, Lushan, and Baofeng counties to investigate. The result of the investigation was that the small-scale projects built by the masses were of good quality. Less than 1% of the small-scale projects in the four counties were damaged during the flood season, and the vast majority of the small-scale projects were intact and played their due role. A rainstorm with 200 millimeters of rainfall was controlled, and no runoff occurred. Why were the small-scale projects built so well? This is because the masses took great care of these projects. When the flood season came, they went up the mountains to prevent floods, guarding the projects day and night, repairing and reinforcing the projects at any time. Therefore, the farmers of Yuxian County themselves explained this practice as "protecting water and soil as protecting life, and managing mountains and rivers as managing the home." These living facts deeply educated those who believed in large-scale projects, looked down on small-scale projects, and looked down on the masses' water management.

In late October of last year, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, under the guidance of responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee, convened the famous "Mang River Conference," followed by a symposium on the treatment of the Shaying River. It timely summarized the creations of the masses. It clearly put forward the "three main" principles for comprehensive water management and eradicating water and drought disasters: under the principle of comprehensive planning and comprehensive management, the principles of focusing on water storage, focusing on small-scale projects, and focusing on community-run projects. This fundamentally changed the old period of focusing on "point" and "line" management of various rivers, and began a new stage of water conservancy construction.

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee submitted the "three main" principles to the people of the province for discussion. After a month of nationwide debate, when the people of the province accepted and mastered the "three main" principles, when people found the correct way to comprehensively manage water and eradicate water and drought disasters, a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement developed unprecedentedly rapidly.

Ignite the Flames of Marching Towards Nature

With the development of the water conservancy movement, the far-reaching significance of the "three main" principles became more and more obvious. It guided people from passively preventing floods and resisting droughts to the path of comprehensively managing water and eradicating water and drought disasters, and fundamentally changing the face of nature. It ignited the flames of the people marching towards nature. This raging fire of transforming nature quickly spread to every corner of the province's countryside. It brought hesitant people into this ranks of transforming nature, it broke through all conventions. The Spring Festival is China's ancient traditional festival. According to the old habits of farmers, production does not start until after the fifth day of the Lunar New Year. This year, people broke the old rules. Farmers themselves described this year's Spring Festival as: "People and horses move on the first day, production starts before dawn. Visiting relatives in the fields, everyone smiles." Whether on the mountains or by the rivers; in the plains or on the sandy ridges, there are laboring crowds everywhere, songs everywhere, and bold words of people conquering nature spreading everywhere. The farmers of Yuxian County sang: "Valiant and high-spirited, going up the mountain is like crossing the Yalu River, the iron shovel is our knife, the hoe is our gun, floods are like American devils, resolutely eliminate them on the mountain." The farmers of Yuanyang County, which has suffered from disasters for years, are poor but have high aspirations. They proposed: "Work hard this winter, work hard this spring, turn waterlogged land into rice fields, turn three reds (red sorghum, red carrots, and red peppers) into three whites (white rice, white flour, and white cotton), and turn the north bank of the Yellow River into a small Jiangnan, and forever remove the 'disaster area' label." They want to develop 450,000 mu of rice in one year (last year there were only 10 mu of experimental rice fields), which will turn the county, which has historically been short of grain, into a surplus grain county.

People launched a "fierce attack" on nature, and the natural landscape of the province is rapidly changing. Mountains quickly put on new clothes like fish scales, hills built grape-like reservoir groups and gully dike groups, plains quickly appeared with a dense network of wells, ponds, ditches, and canals, and depressions are being transformed into paddy fields with clear ridges...

The upsurge of water conservancy construction and the upsurge of transforming nature are coming one after another, and the planned targets are being broken through again and again.

People look back on those days at the beginning of the movement with infinite surprise. In September of last year, it was planned to develop 7 million mu of irrigated area within one year, and some people were still worried that the task would not be assigned. The fact is that, in a drought-resistant wheat planting campaign, 6.1 million mu of irrigated land was developed in more than a month, almost completing the annual target. Soon after, the provincial water conservancy conference proposed a plan to develop 20 million mu of irrigated land, which was indeed a great leap forward plan at that time. However, it was broken through by the actions of the masses within two months.

Collective farmers who have gotten rid of the small-scale peasant economy are running rapidly along the socialist road. Whether they can keep up, whether they dare to win, and whether they will lead the masses from victory to greater victory is a serious test for the leaders of the movement. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China fully estimated the new situation of the rural great leap forward centered on water conservancy construction, fully estimated the infinite power of the collective farmers, and boldly proposed to complete the target of 20 million mu, and then do another 20 million mu. Later, with the development of the movement, it proposed to make persistent efforts, work hard this spring, and expand the "battle results" to 50 million mu.

As of the Spring Festival, the province's farmers have fought a hundred-day battle, expanding the irrigated area by 32 million mu. Now the movement is developing rapidly at a rate of nearly 500,000 mu per day. From now on, there are still three months to work hard. People who are familiar with the situation of the movement believe that the target of 50 million mu will also be greatly broken through by the heroic farmers of Henan.

What kind of leap forward is this? Five thousand mu of irrigated area developed in a winter and spring. This is an unusual number. It is more than seven times the area of ​​irrigated land developed in Henan Province in the thousands of years before liberation. It is more than the total historical achievement of 43 million mu before last winter, including eleven years after liberation, including the first high tide of water conservancy construction. We can also make such a comparison: before cooperativization, a total of 7.5 million mu of irrigated land was developed in the seven years after liberation, and about one million mu of irrigated land was developed each year. In this high tide of water conservancy construction, the daily increase is as high as 300,000 mu to 500,000 mu. That is to say, what was done in a year in the era of the small-scale peasant economy can now be done in two or three days.

"Henan Province will achieve water conservancy in 1959." Many people accepted this plan with both excitement and some suspicion. But this plan will be realized ahead of schedule. The province originally had 43 million mu of irrigated land, and another 50 million mu were developed last winter and this spring. That is to say, before the summer harvest this year, the province will have more than 93 million mu of irrigated land, and 70% of the province's cultivated land will become irrigated land. In a large province with more than 130 million mu of land, 48 million people, and frequent water and drought disasters, water conservancy will be basically realized and ordinary water and drought disasters will be basically eliminated. And all this was completed in a short period of two and a half years (large-scale water management in the province started in the winter of 1955 after the high tide of cooperativization). Unless it is the collective farmers under the leadership of the Communist Party, who can do so many things in such a short period of time? "No need to ask God for a hundred days, there will be surplus grain in drought and flood"

This water conservancy construction movement is not only large in scale and fast in speed, but also high in quality. Various regions, adapt to local conditions, and there are many different types of water conservancy projects, which are rich and colorful.

In mountainous and hilly areas, implement comprehensive mountain management, combine gully and slope management, and combine agriculture, forestry, and water. Make barren mountains and barren slopes green, gullies and platforms, slopes terraced, and terraced fields water conservancy. Dig fish-scale pits, intercept water ditches, desilting ponds on mountain slopes, build protection at the heads of gullies, and build water ponds under the gullies. And build gully dike groups and small reservoir groups according to local conditions. From top to bottom, intercept floods in sections, store water in layers, and form a water storage and soil conservation system in which various mountain management projects are organically connected, so that water does not flow down the mountain and soil does not leave the gully. Not only that, but many places also split mountains and open ridges, build bridges across gullies, and divert river water to high mountains, making high mountain terraced fields water conservancy.

In the plains, implement section-by-section interception, section-by-section control, and section-by-section water use. A new picture of crisscrossing ditches and canals and a network of wells and ponds has appeared. The level ditch (or intercepting ditch) is a water conservancy transportation canal, and grape-like or beaded pit-pond groups are scattered along both sides of the canal, forming a water storage and irrigation network in which canals and ponds are connected, ponds and ponds are connected, wells and ponds are connected, springs are underground in the ponds, and surface water and groundwater are connected. In the event of flooding, it can intercept and discharge excess floodwater (inject into large reservoirs according to plan). In the event of drought, it can also divert water for irrigation.

In depressions and sandy slope areas, methods of water management that eradicate water and drought disasters have also been created. Depressions are ditches, trenches, spring ponds, building crop reservoirs, changing to rice cultivation, and changing to flood-resistant crops. Sandy slopes are to turn the slopes into slate-style terraced fields to prevent soil erosion, build ditches to store water, divert water to the slopes, or dig wells for irrigation.

Various regions have various water management methods, but they also have common characteristics: that is, comprehensive planning and comprehensive management. It is not just digging wells for drought resistance, nor is it just digging ditches for flood drainage; but combining flood control and drought resistance and irrigation, combining benefits and eliminating disadvantages, and combining section-by-section interception and section-by-section water use. All water conservancy engineering measures revolve around one goal: to store the rainwater that falls from the sky, gather the water in the rivers, and extract the groundwater, so that the three waters serve the people, turn harmful water into beneficial water, and thus eliminate water and drought disasters. A rainstorm of 200 millimeters, which is equivalent to a rainstorm that occurs once every ten years, does not cause flood runoff and does not suffer from flooding; if there is a rainstorm of more than 200 millimeters, it will be distributed and handled according to plan. Even if it does not rain for a hundred days, it can be irrigated to protect seedlings and not suffer from drought. Farmers proudly call this: "No need to ask God for a hundred days, there will be surplus grain in drought and flood."

This is Also a Political Movement

This high tide of water conservancy construction is not only an economic construction movement, but also a socialist movement with rich political content. It makes people concretely see the superiority of socialism. Currently, there are two widespread sayings in the rural areas of Henan: "What I couldn't even dream of in the past, the cooperative has done it!" "If cooperativization is not implemented, how can we manage water like this? Now that so many ditches and ponds have been dug, who would let you dig a shovel of soil in their field before cooperativization without breaking their head!"

It is worth mentioning the trends of the well-to-do middle peasants in this high tide. Zheng Hai, an old middle peasant in Malan Township, Yanling County, had serious capitalist thoughts. In the socialist education movement, the members of the community had three debates with him, and he was not convinced. He often said strange things. Water conservancy construction has attracted him to the socialist side. He saw the brilliant prospects of socialism from the comprehensive water management in his township, and became an active member of water conservancy construction. He went around calling people to work before dawn every day, and the members of the community praised him: "Zheng Hai used to have a lot of strange things to say, but now he has become a 'crowing rooster'." Some well-to-do middle peasants automatically took out silver coins that had been stored for 30 years to support water conservancy construction. The well-to-do farmers of Changnao She in Linxian County now say: "Even if you beat me a hundred times, I won't leave the She!"

The water management movement of thousands of troops and horses, and the rapid change in the natural landscape, made the farmers see their own strength, greatly impacted the farmers' generations of ideas of relying on the sky for food and their conservative mentality, and further inspired their determination and enthusiasm to conquer nature. A folk song from Nanzhao farmers vividly reflects this change. The lyrics are:

The Communist Party is like parents.
Repairing water conservancy, blessings are boundless.
Eating no longer depends on God,
Farmers want to be old dragon kings.

The rapid development of water conservancy construction and the rapid change of the natural landscape have opened up the minds of many people, made many people more trusting of agricultural societies and socialism, and closely linked their fate with agricultural societies. Shang Dongtai, a farmer in Caizhai Township, Changge County, is one of them. Fifteen years ago, Shang Dongtai was captured by the Japanese and puppet troops to Xuchang to work as a coolie. While demolishing a building, he picked up a gold brick weighing 248 taels. He regarded it as a treasure for getting rich and kept it secretly for 15 years. In this high tide of water conservancy construction, he automatically took it out to invest in water conservancy. Someone asked him why he was willing to take out the gold brick. He asked the person back: "The whole county and the whole society realize water conservancy, so we are not afraid of drought, not afraid of flooding, production is improved, and life is getting better and better. The society is prosperous, haven't I enjoyed my blessings yet? What am I keeping the gold brick for?!"

What this farmer handed over was not an ordinary gold brick. It symbolized that the farmer had handed his heart over to the community and to socialism. This is a great victory for socialist thought in the countryside. This reflects the changes in the political and ideological aspects of the countryside that are inevitably caused by the high tide of socialist production centered on water conservancy construction.

    大干一冬春，胜过几千年
    ——记河南省水利建设高潮
    魏维良　姚力文
    任何事物的成长，都有渐变有激变，由渐进到跃进。社会革命如此，经济建设也是如此。从去年冬季开始的规模壮阔的河南省水利建设运动，生动有力地证明了这一点。
    找到了治水的正确道路
    河南省地处中原，有太行、伏牛、桐柏、大别、嵩山等五座大山和黄河、淮河、卫河、唐白河等四条大河。地势是西北高，中部平坦，东南低洼。由于地形复杂和每年降雨量多数集中在七八九三个月，而且又往往是暴雨倾注，所以形成冬春干旱，夏秋雨涝。据两千多年的历史记载，河南发生九百多次水旱灾害，严重地影响农副业生产的发展。人民生活十分困苦。受苦的人们常以“清早糠，晌午汤，晚上稀饭照月亮”“一季不收饥荒，二季不收流亡”来形容他们所遭遇的灾难生活。据有关资料的记载，在国民党统治时期，从1937到1945年的八年间，全省农民因水旱灾害，冻饿而死的每年平均约八十万人，有近百万户农民经常处于逃荒要饭，流离失所的境地。因此，根除水旱灾害，改变自然面貌，发展农业生产，就成为河南人民千百年来的愿望。
    解放后，党和人民政府领导河南人民开展了治黄（河）治淮（河）的工作，兴修了五座大型水库和七处洼地蓄洪的大型工程，完成了黄河大堤的培修，整治了河道百多条，使黄河九年未决口，淮河八年未泛滥，大大减轻了洪水为害。可是，这还未能从根本上改变自然面貌。全省每年仍然有三千万亩农作物遭受水灾，有更大面积的农作物常受旱灾。水旱灾害仍然威胁着农业生产的发展。这是因为解放后的最初几年，党和政府正领导人民全力恢复战争创伤，进行社会改革。治水，改变自然面貌的工作，还没有摆在全党和全体人民的议事日程上，这还因为当时的水利建设，只是注意由国家兴办几个大型工程，依靠在各河道的“点”上和“线”上作某些拦洪和排洪工程，或单纯依靠宽河固堤来抗御洪水。虽然每年的洪水灾害少了，可是内涝和干旱的灾害仍未解决。这时，主持水利工作的不少负责工作人员的治水思想，是以大型为主，国家兴办为主，以排水为主，以点线治理为主。他们没有认清“水”的规律，对于水和农民生产、生活的关系，还缺乏全面深刻的理解；他们还没有看见群众的力量，不相信群众兴修小型工程的作用。甚至还规定了某些清规戒律，限制广大群众的治水活动，耽心群众“搞乱”了。
    但是，事实对人们的教育是深刻的。比如颍河上游的白沙水库修好了。1956年8月3日到4日颍河流域降雨二百五十公厘，白沙水库拦蓄洪水六千三百余万公方，尚不及库容的四分之一，可是在白沙水库下游的禹县、许昌、长葛、鄢陵等五个县却淹地二百二十余万亩。再如淮河支流洪河，几年来国家投资三千万元，疏浚河道，加固堤防，1956年8月间全流域一次降雨二百公厘到二百五十公厘。虽然石漫滩水库和老王坡拦洪一亿多公方，洪河未决口，但是西平、上蔡、汝南、平舆等县的内涝滚坡水，竟淹地七百七十九万亩，群众说：只顾在前守堤，防外来洪水，却叫内地沥水抄了后路。
    种种事实向人们表明：只注意大型工程，忽视小型工程；只注意排水，忽视蓄水；只注意依靠国家，忽视依靠群众；只注意点线治理，忽视面的治理的作法，不能消除广大平原地区的水旱灾害。
    山区的情况也是如此。只孤立地植树造林而不作全面的水土保持工作，不能控制水土流失。水土流失严重影响着山区农、林业生产的发展。山区农民说：“山上和尚头，清水断了流，今年盼明年，年年无好收”。禹县鸠山的农民对在荒山上不作水土保持工作，只单一地造林的结论是：“一年青、二年黄、三年见阎王”，只见每年植树，不见成林。或者是年年修梯田垒岸壑，年复一年地冲壑倒岸。
    人们迫切地要求找到治水、治山的正确道路。
    1955年冬季，在农业合作化高潮的推动下，全省掀起第一次群众性兴办水利高潮。六个月时间内，打井一百多万眼，发展水地二千四百万亩。这次高潮初次显示了集体农民的伟大力量，成绩是巨大的。但这次治水高潮中，各地区因地制宜还注意得不够，还没能够完全摸清治水的规律，找到全面治水的方法。
    对这次群众性的水利建设高潮，两种人采取了两种不同的态度。一种是肯定成绩，总结经验，吸取教训；面向群众，到群众中去积极寻找解决全面治水的正确道路和方法。一种是抓住群众兴办水利中的某些缺点，片面夸大，甚至根本否定群众性治水。说什么“水利建设冒进了”，说什么“水利工程是技术工作，群众掌握不了，不应该搞什么群众运动”，“群众办的小型工程起不了多大作用”等等。
    事实给迷信大型工程、看不起小型工程，只注意大水库防洪，看不起群众性小型工程蓄水的右倾保守主义者以响亮的回答。
    位于漭河流域的济源县的党委和政府，他们领导群众从1954年开始，以两冬两春的时间，本着全面治理、综合利用的精神，用二百五十万个劳动日，完成小水库八十四个，修梯田八万亩，打水窖六千五百六十五个，造林二十二亩，控制了漭河上游八百七十平方公里水土流失面积，在1953与1956年雨量基本相同的情况下，漭河的洪水流量由五百个秒公方减为七十个。淹地由十一万亩减少为三万亩，同时发展了水浇地二十万亩，基本上消灭了漭河流域的普通水旱灾害。从而济源县的粮食总产量由1953年的九千八百一十八万斤，提高为1956年的一亿九千七百八十二万斤，增加一倍还多。嵩山脚下的禹县树立了治山的榜样。禹县学习了山西省大泉山的经验，因地制宜地采取了挖鱼鳞坑、截水沟、水平线、等高种植、并配之以挖塘、修小水库等办法，完全治好了鸠山和菜坪山。1957年，在七小时降雨一百二十二公厘的暴雨情况下，两座山都做到了土不流失，水不下山。1957年汛期后，许昌专署水利局曾派调查组赴禹县、郏县、鲁山、宝丰四个县考察。考察的结果是：群众所做小型工程质量良好。四个县的小型工程在汛期破损的不及1％，绝大部分小型工程完整无损，起到应有的作用。一次降雨二百公厘的暴雨，得到控制，不发生迳流。为什么小型工程办得这样好呢？这是因为群众对这些工程十分爱护，汛期一来，他们就上山防汛，日夜防守在工程旁，随时修复与加固工程。所以禹县农民自己解释这种作法，是“保水保土如保命，治山治河如治家”。这些活生生的事实，十分深刻地教育了那些迷信大型，看不起小型工程，看不起群众治水的人们。
    去年十月下旬，中共河南省委在党中央负责同志指导下召开了著名的“漭河会议”，接着又召开了沙颍河治理工作座谈会。及时地总结了群众的创造。明确提出了全面治水，根除水旱灾害的“三主”方针：在全面规划，综合治理的原则下，以蓄水为主，以小型为主，以社办为主的方针。这就从根本上改变了传统的以各河流“点”“线”治理为主的旧时期，开始了水利建设的新阶段。
    中共河南省委和省人民委员会将“三主”方针提交全省人民讨论。经过一个月的全民大辩论，当全省人民接受了并掌握了“三主”方针的时候，当人们找到全面治水，根除水旱灾害的正确途径的时候，一个规模壮阔的群众性水利建设运动，空前迅速地发展起来了。
    燃起向自然进军的烈火
    随着水利运动的开展，“三主”方针的深远意义愈加显著了。它把人们从被动地防洪水，抗旱灾，诱导到全面治水，根除水旱灾害，从根本上改变自然面貌的道路上来。它点燃起人民向自然进军的烈火。这股改造自然的熊熊烈火迅速烧遍全省农村每个角落。它使犹疑不定的人们卷进这个改造大自然的行列，它冲破了一切常规。春节是我国古老的传统节日，按照农民旧习惯，不过初五不生产。今年，人们把老规矩打破了。农民自己形容今年春节是：“初一人马动，五更搞生产。田间去拜年，人人笑连天。”不论是在山岭，还是在河沟旁；在川地，还是在沙岗上，到处是劳动的人群，到处是歌声，到处流传着人们征服大自然的豪语。禹县农民歌唱着：雄赳赳，气昂昂，上山如过鸭绿江，铁锨就是我们的刀，镢头就是我们的枪，洪水好比美国鬼、坚决把它消灭在山上”。连年遭灾的原阳县农民，人穷志气高。他们提出：“苦战一冬，大干一春，变涝地为稻田，变三红（红高粱、红萝卜和红辣椒）为三白（白米、白面、白棉花），变黄河北岸为小江南，永远摘掉灾区“帽子”。他们要在一年内发展水稻四十五万亩（去年只有试验稻田十亩），将使历年缺粮县一跃而为余粮县。
    人们向大自然展开了“猛攻”，全省的自然面貌迅速地变化着。一座座山头很快披上鱼鳞似的新装，一个个丘陵修起了葡萄串式的水库群和谷坊群，一片片平原迅速出现井塘密布，沟渠纵横的水利网，一块块凹地在改变为田埂醒目的稻田……
    修建水利的热潮，改造自然的热潮，一浪赶过一浪，计划指标一次又一次被突破。
    人们怀着无限惊喜的心情，回顾运动初期的那些日子。去年9月份曾计划一年内发展灌溉面积七百万亩，有些人还曾耽心任务分配不下去，事实是，一个抗旱种麦运动，一个多月的时间就发展了水地六百一十万亩，几乎完成了全年指标。随后不久，全省水利会议提出发展两千万亩水地的计划，这在当时确是一个大跃进计划。两个月内却又被群众的行动突破。
    摆脱了小农经济的集体农民，沿着社会主义大道迅速奔跑。能不能跟上去，敢不敢胜利，会不会领导群众从胜利走向更大的胜利，这是对运动领导者的严重考验。中共河南省委充分估计了以建设水利为中心的农村大跃进的新形势，充分估计了集体农民的无限力量，大胆地提出完成两千万亩，再干两千万亩的指标。之后，又随着运动的发展，提出再接再厉，大干一春，把“战果”扩大到五千万亩的号召。
    截至春节为止，全省农民大战百天，已扩大水地面积三千二百万亩。现在运动正以日增近五十万亩的速度迅速发展着。从现在起，还可大干三个月，熟悉运动情况的人们认为，五千万亩这个指标，也将被英雄的河南农民大大突破。
    这是怎样的一种跃进呢？一个冬春，发展灌溉面积五千万亩。这是一个不寻常的数字，它比解放前几千年来河南全省发展水地面积的七倍还多，它比去冬以前，包括解放后十一年，包括第一次水利建设高潮在内的有史以来的总成绩四千三百万亩还多一些。我们还可以作这样一个比较，合作化以前，解放后的七年共发展水地七百五十万亩，每年发展水地约百万亩，而在这次水利建设高潮中，每日可增加三十万亩到五十万亩之多。这就是说，小农经济时代一年间做的事，现在两三天工夫就做出来了。
    “河南省1959年实现水利化”，曾经有不少人是怀着既兴奋，又有些怀疑的心情来接受这个计划的。可是这个计划又将被提前实现了。全省原有水浇地四千三百万亩，去冬今春又发展五千万亩，这就是说，今年夏收以前，全省将拥有九千三百多万亩水地，全省70％的耕地变成水地了。在一个拥有一亿三千多万亩土地，四千八百万人口，常遭水旱灾害侵袭的，地广人多的大省里，基本实现水利化，基本消除普通水旱灾害。而这一切又是在短短两年半（全省较大规模的治水是从1955年冬季合作化高潮后开始的）的时间里完成的。除非是共产党领导下的集体农民，谁又能在这么短时间内，做出这么多事情呢？“百日不求天，旱涝有余粮”
    这次水利建设运动不仅是规模大、速度快，而且质量高。各种不同地区，因地制宜，水利工程多种多样，丰富多彩。
    在山区和丘陵区，实行全面治山，沟坡兼治，农林水相结合。使荒山荒坡绿化、沟壑川台化，坡地梯田化、梯田水利化。在山坡上挖鱼鳞坑、截水沟，澄沙池，沟头修防护，沟下修水塘。并因地制宜修建谷坊群和小水库群。从上到下，分节拦洪，层层蓄水，形成种种治山工程有机相联的蓄水保土系统，做到水不下山，土不出沟。不仅如此，许多地方还劈山开岭，遇沟架桥，引河水上高山，使高山梯田水利化。
    在平原，就实行节节拦蓄，节节控制，节节用水。出现了沟渠纵横，井塘罗布的新图景。水平沟（或叫截水沟）是水利交通渠，沿渠的两侧散布着葡萄式的或串珠式的坑塘群，形成渠塘相通，塘塘相通，井塘相连，塘中下泉，地上水与地下水相通的蓄水灌溉网。涝时，可拦蓄和排泄过量洪水（有计划注入大水库），旱时，又可引水灌溉。
    在凹地和沙岗坡地，也都创造了根除水旱灾害的治水办法。凹地是挖沟洫、泉塘，修作物水库，改种水稻，改种耐涝作物。沙岗坡地是把岗坡地变成砚台式梯田，防止水土流失，扎沟蓄水，引水上岗或打井灌溉。
    各种不同地区有着多种多样的治水方法，但也有共同的特点：这就是全面规划，综合治理。不是单一地打井抗旱，也不是单一地挖沟排洪；而是治涝防洪与抗旱灌溉相结合，兴利与除弊相结合，节节拦蓄与节节用水相结合。一切水利工程措施又都是围绕着一个目的：把天降雨水蓄起来，河里的水聚起来，地下水提出来，让三水为人民服务，变害水为利水，从而消除水旱灾害。一次降雨二百公厘相当于十年一遇的暴雨，不发生洪水迳流，不遭淹；一次降雨二百公厘以上，有计划分配处理。百日不落雨，也能灌溉保苗，不受旱。农民们自豪地把这叫做：“百日不求天，旱涝有余粮”。
    这也是一次政治运动
    这次水利建设高潮，不仅是一次经济建设运动，同时也是一次有丰富政治内容的社会主义运动。它使人们具体地看到社会主义的优越性。当前河南农村普遍流传着这样两种说法：“过去做梦也想不到的，合作社说办就办到了！”“不实行合作化，那能这样治水。现在挖这么多沟塘，在合作化以前，你到谁地里挖一锨土，还要打破头哩！”
    值得提出的是富裕中农在这次高潮中的动向。鄢陵县马拦乡的老中农郑海，资本主义思想严重，在社会主
  义教育运动中，社员们曾和他进行过三次辩论，他都没服气，常说个怪话。水利建设把他吸引到社会主义方面来了。他从本乡的全面治水，看到社会主义的灿烂前景，成为兴修水利的积极分子，每天天不明就四处叫人上工，社员们夸奖他：“郑海原是怪话多，现在变成‘打鸣的鸡’了。”还有的富裕中农把存放三十年的银洋自动拿出来，来支援水利建设。临颍县常闹出社的富裕农户，现在表示：“打我一百棍，也不出社了！”
    千军万马的治水运动，自然面貌的迅速改变，使农民们看到了自身的力量，大大冲击了农民们世代相传的靠天吃饭的观念，和守旧的心理状态，进一步鼓舞了他们征服自然的决心和热情。南召农民的一首歌谣，十分生动地反映出这一变化。歌词是：
    共产党，像爹娘。
    修水利，福无疆。
    吃饭再不靠天给，
    农民要当老龙王。
    水利建设的神速发展，自然面貌的迅速改观，使许多人开了脑筋，使许多人更加信赖农业社，信赖社会主
  义，把自己的命运和农业社紧紧地联系在一起。长葛县蔡寨乡农民尚东太就是其中的一个。十五年前，尚东太被日伪军抓到许昌当苦工，在拆除建筑物时，曾拾得一块重二百四十八两的金砖，他把它当作发家致富的至宝，一直秘密保存了十五年，在这次水利建设高潮中，他自动拿出投资搞水利。有人问他为啥舍得把金砖拿出来，他反过来问那人说：“全县全社实现水利化，一不怕旱，二不怕淹，生产提高，日子越过越好，社里兴腾了，还没我的福享。我还留着金砖干啥？！”
    这个农民交出的不是一块普通的金砖，它象征着农民把自己的心交给社里，交给社会主义了。这是社会主义思想在农村的巨大胜利。这反映了以水利建设为中心的社会主义生产高潮所必然引起的农村政治思想方面的变化。
