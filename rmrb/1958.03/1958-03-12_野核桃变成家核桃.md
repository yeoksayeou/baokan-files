Things from All Over

    Our Newspaper News: In the mountains near the Comprehensive Farm in Zhuxi County, Hubei Province, wild walnut trees grow everywhere. In the winter of 1955, when Yan Huaizhi, the first secretary of the Zhuxi County Party Committee, came to the farm, he said to the farm director Hou Tingren, "Old Hou, can we plant some walnuts?" Hou Tingren said, "There are no seeds." Secretary Yan said, "If we transplant them, can we turn wild walnuts into domestic walnuts?" The two of them took two hoes and went to the hillside, transplanting two wild walnut trees. In 1957, these two trees bore two domestic walnuts with thin shells and plump kernels. In 1956 and 1957, through transplanting, this farm has transformed 1,500 wild walnut trees into domestic walnut trees. It is estimated that this year they will be able to harvest more than 100 yuan worth of walnuts, and the income will increase more and more in the coming years. They plan to transform another 5,000 wild walnut trees into domestic walnut trees this year, and have also cultivated more than 10,000 walnut seedlings, preparing for future transplanting.
    Wild walnuts have thick shells and small kernels, and cannot be eaten or used for oil. As long as the wild walnut trees are transplanted locally, changing their location, they can be transformed into domestic walnuts. After three consecutive years of transplanting, they can be turned into very good paper-shell walnuts.

    野核桃变成家核桃
    本报讯　湖北省竹溪县综合农场附近的高山上到处长的是野核桃树。1955年冬天竹溪县委第一书记阎怀智来到农场的时候，曾向场长侯廷仁说：“老侯，能不能种些核桃？”侯廷仁说：“没有种子。”阎书记说：“移栽一下，能不能将野核桃变成家核桃？”他们两人就拿两把锄头到山坡上，移栽了两棵野核桃树。1957年这两棵树结了两个壳薄仁厚的家核桃。1956年和1957年两年来这个农场经过移栽已将一千五百棵野核桃树变成家核桃树。预计今年就能收一百多元的核桃，明后年收入会越来越大。他们准备今年再将五千棵野核桃树变成家核桃树，还育了一万多棵核桃树秧，准备今后移栽。
    野核桃壳厚仁少，不能食用和打油。只要将野核桃树就地移栽，转个窝就能变成家核桃。连移栽三年，就能变成很好的纸壳核桃。
