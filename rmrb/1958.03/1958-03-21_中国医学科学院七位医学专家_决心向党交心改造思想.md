Seven Medical Experts from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
Resolve to Open Their Hearts to the Party and Remold Their Thinking

(Our Dispatch) Seven medical experts from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, at a general meeting of all staff members on the 19th, set themselves on fire, opened their hearts to the Party, and resolved to carry out self-revolution and transform themselves into intellectuals of the working class.

Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lin Qiaozhi, spoke at the meeting about writing a big-character poster of self-criticism after ideological struggle. In her big-character poster, she revealed her ten fears: "Fear of the new, fear of change, fear of movement, fear of imbalance, fear of criticism, fear of offending people, fear that others won't believe, fear of failure, fear of difficulties, fear of being looked down upon." And she wrote: "All these various fears, in the final analysis, are personal plans, are bourgeois ideology." She talked about how she had been in low spirits and ideologically "butting heads" when she saw big-character posters criticizing her, and had engaged in fierce ideological struggle. However, with the help of the Party, she finally moved forward through struggle. She concluded the meeting with confidence, saying that to take the socialist road, one must dig at the roots, but this is not easy, and requires arduous struggle to revolutionize oneself. She said that she is now in a very happy mood and is wholeheartedly devoted to the Party, determined to thoroughly transform herself with the help of the Party and the masses.

Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, Huang Wan, cited facts at the meeting to illustrate his years of fame and fortune seeking and individualism, as well as the losses and impacts on scientific research work. He said that due to individualistic thinking, he had "set an example" among the doctors he led in advocating emphasizing professional work and neglecting politics, guiding some doctors onto the road of being professionally competent but not ideologically sound. He also talked about how in "handling interpersonal relationships, everything was based on personal interests." He "enthusiastically helped" those who were "helpful to him" and "coldly avoided" those who were "unprofitable to him." He said that all of this was completely contrary to the policies of coordination and cooperation, building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and training cadres who are both ideologically sound and professionally competent, and what he had gained was political decadence and a pessimistic outlook on life. He said that the Double-Anti movement awakened him like spring thunder, and the Party pointed out the bright road for him - the socialist road. He expressed his determination to abandon the "old self" and establish a "new self," to continue digging into his own thoughts, to resolutely take the socialist road, and to contribute all his strength. Professor of Physiology, Zhang Xijun, posted more than two hundred big-character posters in the "Double-Anti" movement. In the big-character posters, he examined his conservative thinking: sticking to old sayings in academics, not daring to innovate, not learning "new technologies," and tolerating wrong words and deeds without principle in life, with an attitude of seeking peace at all costs. He talked at the meeting about his preliminary feelings in this conscious ideological revolution in the past few days. He said: "As long as you completely put down the airs of an old expert and eliminate ideological concerns, you will burn yourself and others without reservation. This time I uncovered my lid and also burned many old friends and young friends." Researcher of Biochemistry, Li Shie, Associate Researcher of Medicinal Plants, Fu Fengyong, Associate Researcher of Pharmacology, Song Zhenyu, and Associate Researcher of Medicinal Chemistry, Liang Xiaotian, also talked about their ideological struggles and criticized their bourgeois ideology at the meeting.

Zhang Zhiqiang, the Party Secretary of the Academy, called on all staff members at the meeting to "speak frankly, exchange ideas, uncover the lid, and rummage through boxes and cabinets" to thoroughly expose problems in scientific research, talent cultivation, medical work, and thrift in running science, and to achieve a double leap in ideology and work.

    中国医学科学院七位医学专家
    决心向党交心改造思想
    本报讯　中国医学科学院的七位医学专家在19日举行的全院工作人员大会上引火烧身，向党交心，决心实行自我革命，把自己改造成为工人阶级知识分子。
    妇产科教授林巧稚在会上谈到经过思想斗争写出了自我检讨的大字报。她在大字报上揭露了自己的十怕：“怕新、怕改、怕动、怕不平衡状态、怕批评、怕得罪人、怕对方不相信、怕失败、怕困难、怕人家看不起”。并写着：“这各种各样的怕，归根到底，就是个人打算，就是资产阶级思想”。她谈到自己见大字报批评自己时，也曾经情绪低落，思想上“顶牛”，展开了激烈的思想斗争。可是在党的帮助下，终于经过斗争而前进了。她在会上最后满怀信心地说，要走社会主义的道路，就要挖挖根，但这不是容易的事情，要经过艰苦的斗争，革自己的命。她说，现在她心情很愉快，对党是一心一意，决心在党和群众的帮助下彻底改造自己。
    内科副教授黄宛在会上列举事实说明自己多年来的名利思想和个人英雄主义，以及给科学研究工作带来的损失和影响。他说，由于个人主义思想，他曾“以身作则”在所领导的大夫中提倡重业务、轻政治，引导部分大夫走上了只专不红的道路。他还谈到在“处理人与人之间的关系时，也都以个人利益为基础”。凡是对他“有帮助的，便热情相助”，对他“无利的，就冷淡躲避”。他说，这一切是处处与协调合作、多快好省地为社会主义建设、培养又红又专的干部政策相反的，而自己所得到的是政治上的颓废和人生观的消极。他说，双反运动像春雷一样震醒了我，党给我指出了光明大道--走社会主义道路。他表示决心抛弃“旧我”树立“新我”，继续挖掘自己的思想，坚决走社会主义道路，贡献自己的全部力量。生理系教授张锡钧在“双反”运动中贴了二百多张大字报，在大字报上他检查了自己的保守思想：在学术上墨守成言，不敢革新，不学“新技术”，在生活上无原则地迁就错误言行，抱着息事宁人的态度。他在会上谈到这几天在这场自觉的思想革命中的初步感受。他说：“只要彻底放下老专家的架子，思想顾虑打消了，就会毫无保留地烧自己，也烧别人。这次我揭了自己的盖子也烧了很多老朋友和青年朋友。”生化系研究员李士谔、药用植物系副研究员傅丰永、药理系副研究员宋振玉、药物化学系副研究员梁晓天也都在会上谈了自己的思想斗争情况，批判自己的资产阶级思想。
    这个院的党委书记张之强在大会上号召全院工作人员“开诚相见，思想交锋、揭开盖子、翻箱倒柜”，彻底揭发科学研究、培养人才、医疗工作、勤俭办科学等方面的问题，实现思想、工作双跃进。
