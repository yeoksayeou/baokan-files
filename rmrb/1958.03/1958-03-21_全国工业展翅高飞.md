National Industry Soars

The leap forward plans proposed by the worker masses will increase this year's industrial output value by one-third compared to last year, exceeding the state plan's growth figure by more than double.

Xinhua News Agency reporter Tian Lin commented on the current new situation on the industrial front: Just as the vast army on the agricultural front is galloping forward, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front are also breaking conventions, overcoming difficulties, and climbing the highest peak of industrial development speed in our country since entering the construction period, in a vigorous movement against waste and conservatism, comparing advanced experiences and competing in enthusiasm. This year's production upsurge is more intense, covers a wider range, is deeper, and has greater effects than any previous production movement.

After bottom-up discussions among the broad masses of workers, this year, the output of steel, iron, coal, and nitrogen fertilizer may all increase significantly, and machinery is even more prominent, potentially reaching over 82%. This year, the enthusiasm of local industries is even greater than that of the central government. The leap forward targets proposed by provinces such as Shandong, Guizhou, Gansu, Henan, Hunan, and Yunnan are all more than 50% higher than last year.

Judging from the leap forward targets that the national worker masses are striving to achieve, this year's total industrial output value is very likely to increase by more than 33% compared to last year. This figure is more than double the national plan's growth figure passed by the National People's Congress a month ago.

With the preliminary foundation of industrialization laid by the First Five-Year Plan, coupled with the improvement of central and local relations that expanded local authority, and the increase in public accumulation funds of agricultural cooperatives, our country can further implement the policy of "600 million people running industry," use the mass line method to run industry, and take the road of combining large, medium, and small enterprises to run industry. One of the characteristics of the current new situation on our country's industrial front is the great development of local industries, the establishment of small and medium-sized factories at the county level, achieving "stars all over the sky" and "blooming everywhere." This is entirely in line with the characteristics of our country with its large population, vast land, and abundant resources. This truly achieves "more, faster, better, and more economical results." For example, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is designing a chemical fertilizer plant for county industries that produces 8,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate (with the same fertilizer effect as ammonium sulfate) per year, requiring an investment of only 3.5 million yuan and a construction time of only five to six months. If each county builds one, it can produce 16 million tons of chemical fertilizer a year, while the United States only produced slightly more than 20 million tons of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers in 1955-1956, calculated based on the nitrogen and phosphorus content of our country's nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers! The State Economic Commission has already suggested that the central industrial ministries create a set of standard designs for small factories for county industries. This set of standard designs includes small coal kilns, small chemical fertilizer plants, small hydropower stations, small mechanical joint processing plants, and small cement plants. If each of the more than 2,000 counties across the country builds a set, wouldn't that be an industrial "grape cluster" and "stars all over the sky"!

Due to the industrial leap forward, this year's national fiscal revenue may increase by several billion yuan, and therefore the scale of capital construction will also expand accordingly. The industrial leap forward will also enable agriculture to leap forward faster because it will receive more support. In short, due to the industrial leap forward, not only has the economic situation initially predicted at the beginning of this year been completely changed; but also the prospects for the Second Five-Year Plan will be even more magnificent and splendid; and the time to catch up with Britain may not even take fifteen years.

When people talk about the great leap forward in industrial production and construction, they naturally think of the issue of raw materials. Especially since raw materials were once quite tight last spring. Regarding this issue, relevant people's view is six characters: "There are difficulties, but they can be solved." After a year of production development, the situation of raw material shortage has long been eased. Currently, steel inventory is more than enough to meet daily needs, and timber and cement, due to increased production, are generally sufficient. Only the variety of metal materials still has some problems, but even without the great leap forward, the problem of metal material varieties would still exist. This problem can be solved through increased production and savings, finding substitutes, and mutual adjustment and use. The real problem lies in doing a good job in mutual coordination and cooperation and mutual support.

    全国工业展翅高飞
    工人群众提出的跃进计划，将使今年工业产值比
    去年增长三分之一，超过国家计划增长数字一倍多
    据新华社20日讯　新华社记者田林评述当前工业战线上的新形势说：正当农业战线上千军万马奔驶前进的时候，工业战线上的广大工人群众也在气势磅礴的反浪费、反保守、比先进、比干劲的运动中，打破常规，克服困难，攀登我国自进入建设时期以来，工业发展速度的最高峰。今年生产高潮来势之猛，涉及范围之广和深，效果之大，都超过了往年任何一次的生产运动。
    经过广大工人群众自下而上的讨论，今年，钢、铁、煤、氮肥的产量都可能增长很多，机械更突出，可能达到82％以上。今年地方工业的劲头比中央的还大还足。山东、贵州、甘肃、河南、湖南、云南等省所提出的跃进指标都比去年高50％以上。
    从全国工人群众争取实现的跃进指标来看，今年工业总产值很有可能比去年增长33％以上。这个数字比一个月前全国人民代表大会通过的国家计划增长数字高一倍还多。
    有了第一个五年计划所奠定的工业化初步基础，加上中央和地方关系改进使地方权限扩大，以及农业合作社公积金的增加，今后我国就可以进一步地贯彻六亿人民办工业的方针，用群众路线的方法来办工业，走大中小型结合的道路来办工业。当前，我国工业战线上新形势的特点之一，就是地方工业的大发展，就是以县为单位办中小型工厂，作到“满天星”和“遍地开花”。这样作，完全适合我国人多、地大、物博的特点。这样作，真正能够作到“多快好省”。例如，化学工业部正在为县工业设计的年产八千吨碳酸氢铵
  （肥效和硫铵相同）化肥厂，投资只要三百五十万元，建设时间只要五六个月。如果每县建一个，一年就能生产化肥一千六百万吨，而美国在1955—1956年度生产的氮肥和磷肥，按我国氮肥和磷肥的含氮、含磷量计算，也才不过二千万吨多一点呢！国家经济委员会已经建议中央各工业部为县工业作出一套小工厂的标准设计。这套标准设计包括小煤窑、小化肥厂、小水电站、小机械联合加工厂、小水泥厂等。如果全国二千多个县，一县建设一套，这岂不是工业上的“葡萄串”“满天星”吗！
    由于工业跃进，今年国家财政收入可能增加几十亿元，因而基本建设的规模也将随之更加扩大。工业跃进，农业也会因得到更多的支援而跃进得更快。总之，由于工业跃进，不仅今年年初预计的经济形势已经完全改观；而且第二个五年计划的前景，也将更加雄伟，更加壮丽；赶上英国的时间，也很可能用不着十五年。
    人们一谈到工业生产和建设的大跃进，很自然就会联想到原材料的问题。特别是因为去年春天原材料曾经一度相当紧张。对于这个问题，有关方面人士的看法是六个字：有困难，能解决。经过一年来生产的发展，原材料紧张的局面早已缓和下来。目前钢材库存应付日常需要已经有余，木材、水泥等由于增产，大体上也可以够用。只是金属材料的品种方面还有一些问题，但是，即使不搞大跃进，金属材料的品种问题还是存在的。这个问题可以用增产节约、找代用品和互相调剂使用等办法来求得解决。真正的问题还在于搞好互相间的配合协作和互相支援。
