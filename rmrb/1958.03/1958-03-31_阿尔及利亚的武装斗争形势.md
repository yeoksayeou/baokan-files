The Algerian people have achieved great victories in more than three years of anti-colonialist struggle. In March and April 1957, the National Liberation Army was already active throughout the region north of the Sahara Desert, and the battlefields in eastern, northern, and western Algeria were basically connected. In the year that followed, the war situation developed further.

The Failure of the French Army's "Focus Sweep"

In the early stages of the Algerian War, the French colonial army believed that the National Liberation Army was nothing more than a "disorganized rabble" that was vulnerable to attack. Therefore, it adopted a policy of all-out offensive, conducting "encirclement and suppression" everywhere. As a result, because the National Liberation Army adopted a proactive approach and received the support of the broad masses of residents, the French colonial army's "general suppression" was crushed, and the guerrilla areas expanded day by day.

In order to avoid dispersing its forces too much, the French colonial army had to turn to a new policy of "focus sweep," attempting to concentrate larger forces to attack some of the National Liberation Army's strongholds and annihilate some of the National Liberation Army's main force. This became more apparent after March and April 1957.

What were the results of the French colonial army's "focus sweep"? Let's take a look at the battle situation in the Collo Mountains. The Collo Mountains are located in the North Constantine War Zone and are one of the strongholds of the Algerian National Liberation Army. The French colonial army launched an offensive in mid-June 1957. They designated an area of approximately four thousand square kilometers between the city of Collo on the Mediterranean coast (northwest of Philippeville), the town of Taher southeast of Jijel, and the town of El Milia to the south as a "restricted zone," forcibly relocating 300,000 peaceful residents in this area. At the same time, they dispatched more than 100 bombers to drop thousands of bombs, attempting to wipe out all the local liberation army. However, with the help of residents and familiar with the local terrain, the liberation army fighters successfully avoided the enemy's fierce bombing and, after the bombing, used methods such as ambushes, attacks, explosions, and flanking maneuvers to crush the invasion of the colonial army's ground forces. The French colonial army's "sweep" lasted for several months, with no results, and the guerrillas remained active in the area.

The French colonial army's "sweeps" in the Greater Kabylie Mountains, the Aurès Mountains, the Nemencha Mountains, the Algiers War Zone, and the Oran War Zone yielded the same results. This is because: the French colonial army burned, killed, looted, and plundered the Algerian residents during the war, arousing widespread resistance among the residents, resulting in more people joining the ranks of the liberation army. The National Liberation Army received close cooperation from the residents, and the French colonial army's blockade in terms of food, medicine, and intelligence was ineffective.

The Emergence of a Stalemate in the War

The emergence of a stalemate in the war is an important feature of the development of the military situation over the past year. This situation was gradually formed through sweeps and counter-sweeps, encirclements and counter-encirclements, and multiple battles.

In March and April 1957, many fierce battles took place in the North Constantine, Aurès-Nemencha in eastern Algeria, Greater Kabylie and Algiers in the north, and Oran and other war zones in the west. Some of these battles were initiated by the National Liberation Army. In the months that followed, despite the French launching a frantic "sweep," the National Liberation Army's proactive attacks were further strengthened.

In August, in order to reverse the situation, the French army launched a "major offensive," not only using all the latest weapons of the army, but also dispatching a large number of air force and paratroopers, and also using naval vessels to blockade the Mediterranean coast and bombard coastal areas. However, this "major offensive" ended with heavy casualties for the French army. In the fourteen days from August 11 to 25 alone, the French army suffered more than 3,400 casualties.

At the end of October 1957, in order to commemorate the third anniversary of the Algerian people's uprising, the National Liberation Army launched a nationwide military offensive that stretched from the coastline in the north to the Sahara in the south, and from the borders of Tunisia and Morocco in the east and west. This was launched shortly after the end of the colonial army's "major offensive" and became an important sign of the emergence of a stalemate in the war. The National Liberation Army's offensive severely hit the French colonial army on all battlefields, including the Sahara region. In the one month from November 26 to December 26 alone, the French army suffered approximately 6,600 casualties.

In January and February of this year, fierce battles took place in all war zones again. According to a report in the French newspaper "L'Humanité" on March 1, there were more than 500 military operations of considerable scale in Algeria in February, with a total of 858 battalions and 425,000 troops of the French army concentrated in northern Algeria for combat.

The above simple situation shows that the war situation since November 1957 has been more tense than in the past. The National Liberation Army's initiative has also increased more than before, while the French colonial army is increasingly falling into a passive and beaten position.

Battles in the Sahara Region

Another major feature of the development of the Algerian people's armed struggle in recent times is the opening of the Sahara War Zone. This is the Algerian people's struggle to defend national resources—oil.

In early November last year, the National Liberation Army attacked the French army protecting the exploration team of the French "Algerian Oil Company" in the Timimoun region of the Sahara, and multiple fierce battles took place 65 kilometers north of Timimoun. In mid- and late November, the battles in the Timimoun region continued, and the "Algerian Oil Company" was forced to suspend its exploration work.

In mid-November 1957, the French colonial authorities declared the three regions of Timimoun, Biskra-Touggourt, and Hassi Messaoud in the Sahara as "restricted zones." Hassi Messaoud is located southeast of Ouargla, and the oil wells there began producing oil at the end of 1957. The "French Petroleum Company" operated by French colonialists transported the oil from Hassi Messaoud to Touggourt via pipelines, then from Touggourt to Philippeville by railway, and then to France. The purpose of French imperialists exploiting oil in Algeria at this time was, on the one hand, to eagerly seek high profits, and on the other hand, to attempt to attract various domestic bourgeois groups to further support the Algerian War and agree to pay the increasing military expenses for this war. Not only that, but France also attempted to exchange part of its oil interests for the support of other Western countries. American imperialism coveted Algeria's rich resources and one of the purposes of giving France a large amount of military and financial "aid" was to "sit down and divide the spoils" of the Sahara's oil.

However, the Algerian people oppose both the continued rule and exploitation of the Algerian people by French imperialism and the intrusion of American imperialism and other imperialisms. The Algerian National Liberation Front has stated that the Sahara can only be developed with the consent and participation of the Algerian people. Not long ago, the Algerian Communist Party also issued a statement opposing the imperialist plan of "Sahara Economic Consortium" to develop the Sahara. The Algerian people use military action to demonstrate their determination to defend national oil resources. Although the French colonial authorities have filled the railway line transporting oil with outposts, they cannot prevent the liberation army's attacks. In January and February of this year, the Touggourt-Philippeville oil transport line was constantly attacked and exploded by the Algerian armed forces, and oil trains were damaged several times.

The development of the Algerian war situation shows that the combat strength of the Algerian people under the leadership of the Algerian National Liberation Front is becoming stronger and stronger. If France stubbornly refuses to recognize the Algerian people's right to independence, it will suffer a more severe defeat than in Indochina. (Attached Pictures)

    阿尔及利亚的武装斗争形势
    言金
    阿尔及利亚人民在三年多的反殖民主义斗争中已经取得了巨大的胜利。在1957年三、四月间，民族解放军已经在撒哈拉沙漠以北的整片地区内到处活跃了，阿尔及利亚东部、北部和西部的各个战场已经基本上连成一片。在这以后的一年中，战争形势又有了进一步的发展。
    法军“重点扫荡”的失败
    在阿尔及利亚战争的初期，法国殖民军以为民族解放军不过是“乌合之众”，不堪一击，因此采取了全面进攻的方针，到处进行“围剿”。结果，由于民族解放军采取积极主动的方针，同时得到了广大居民的支持，因此法国殖民军的“全面进剿”被粉碎了，游击地区一天天扩大。
    为了避免把兵力过于分散，法国殖民军不得不转而采取“重点扫荡”的新方针，企图集中较大的兵力来进攻民族解放军的一些坚强的据点，歼灭民族解放军的一部分主力。这在1957年三、四月后表现得更为明显。
    法国殖民军的“重点扫荡”取得了什么结果呢？让我们看一下科洛山区的战斗情况吧。科洛山区位于北君士坦丁战区，是阿尔及利亚民族解放军的坚强据点之一。法国殖民军于1957年6月中开始发动进攻。他们把地中海沿岸的科洛市（在斐利浦城的西北）、吉哲里市东南的塔歇尔镇和偏南的厄尔米利亚镇之间面积约四千平方公里的地区划成“禁区”，把这个地区内三十万和平居民强迫迁徙，同时出动一百多架轰炸机投下了数千枚炸弹，想把当地的解放军全部消灭。但是获得居民协助和熟悉当地地形的解放军战士顺利地避过了敌人的猛烈轰炸，在轰炸后运用埋伏、袭击、爆炸、迂回作战等方法粉碎了殖民军地面部队的进犯。法国殖民军的“扫荡”延续了好几个月，结果毫无所得，游击队在该地区内照旧活跃。
    法国殖民军在大卡比利山区、奥雷斯山区、内门查山区、阿尔及尔战区和阿兰战区进行的“扫荡”，结果也都一样。这是因为：法国殖民军在作战时对阿尔及利亚的居民进行烧、杀、掳掠，引起居民的普遍反抗，因而有更多的人参加了解放军的队伍。民族解放军得到了居民的密切合作，法国殖民军在粮食、医药、情报等方面的封锁都没有收效。
    战争相持局面的出现
    战争相持局面的出现，是一年来军事形势发展上的一个重要特点，这个局面是通过扫荡与反扫荡、包围与反包围、以及多次战斗而逐渐形成的。
    1957年3、4月间，在阿尔及利亚东部的北君士坦丁、奥雷斯—内门查，北部的大卡比利、阿尔及尔，西部的阿兰等战区内都发生过多次激烈的战斗，其中一部分战斗，是民族解放军的主动出击。在这以后的几个月中，尽管法国发动了疯狂的“扫荡”，民族解放军的主动出击更加加强了。
    8月间，法军为了扭转局势，曾发动一次“大攻势”，不但使用了陆军方面的一切新式武器，而且出动了大量空军和伞兵，还用海军舰艇封锁地中海海岸和炮击沿海地区。但这个“大攻势”结果以法军伤亡惨重而结束。仅从8月11日到25日这十四天内，法军就伤亡了三千四百多人。
    1957年10月底，民族解放军为了纪念阿尔及利亚人民起义三周年，发动了北起海岸线、南至撒哈拉、东西到突尼斯和摩洛哥边境的全国性军事出击。这是在殖民军的“大攻势”结束不久后发动的，就成为战争相持局面出现的一个重要的标志。民族解放军的这次攻势，在包括撒哈拉地区在内的各个战场上，严重地打击了法国殖民军队。仅从11月26日到12月26日这一个月中，法军伤亡人数共达六千六百人左右。
    在今年1、2月间，各个战区又都发生了激烈的战斗。据3月1日法国“人道报”报道，2月间在阿尔及利亚共发生了五百多次相当规模的军事行动，法军共有八百五十八个营总共四十二万五千人的军队集中在阿尔及利亚北部从事战斗。
    以上的简单情况说明，1957年11月以后的战争局势比过去是更加紧张了。民族解放军掌握的主动权也比前增大，而法国殖民军队则日益陷于被动挨打的地位。
    撒哈拉地区的战斗
    最近期间阿尔及利亚人民武装斗争发展中的又一个重大特点，是撒哈拉战区的开辟。这是阿尔及利亚人民保卫国家资源——石油——的斗争。
    去年11月上旬，民族解放军在撒哈拉的迪米蒙地区向保护法国“阿尔及利亚石油公司”勘探队的法国军队进攻，在迪米蒙以北六十五公里的地方发生多次激烈战斗。11月中旬和下旬，迪米蒙地区的战斗还继续进行，“阿尔及利亚石油公司”被迫停止了它的勘探工作。
    1957年11月中，法国殖民当局在撒哈拉方面宣布迪米蒙、比斯卡拉—杜古特、哈西—迈萨乌德三个地区为“禁区”。哈西—迈萨乌德处在乌阿格拉市的东南，该处油井就在1957年底开始产油，法国殖民主义者经营的“法国石油公司”把石油通过输油管从哈西—迈萨乌德运往杜古特，再由杜古特经铁路运往斐利浦城，再输往法国。法国帝国主义者这个时候在阿尔及利亚开采石油的目的，一方面固然是急于谋取高额利润，另一方面也是企图以此来吸引国内资产阶级各个集团进一步支持阿尔及利亚战争，并且同意为这种战争支出日益增加的军事费用。不但如此，法国还企图用出让一部分石油利益的办法来换取其它西方国家对它的支持。美国帝国主义对阿尔及利亚的丰富资源是垂涎的，它给法国大量军事和财政“援助”的目的之一就在于要对撒哈拉的石油“坐地分赃”。
    但是阿尔及利亚人民既反对法国帝国主义对阿尔及利亚人民继续统治和剥削，也反对美国帝国主义及其他帝国主义的侵入。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线曾经声明，必须在阿尔及利亚人民同意与参加之下才能开发撒哈拉。不久以前，阿尔及利亚共产党也发表声明，反对“撒哈拉经济联营”开发撒哈拉的帝国主义计划。阿尔及利亚人民用军事行动来表现他们保卫国家石油资源的决心。尽管法国殖民当局沿着运输石油的铁路线满布岗哨，但也无法阻止解放军的袭击。今年1、2月内，杜古特—斐利浦城的石油运输线不断遭到阿尔及利亚武装部队的袭击和爆炸，石油列车几次遭到破坏。
    阿尔及利亚战局的发展表明，在阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领导下，阿尔及利亚人民的战斗力量是越来越强大了。如果法国还是顽固地拒绝承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，它将遭到比在印度支那更为严重的失败。（附图片）
