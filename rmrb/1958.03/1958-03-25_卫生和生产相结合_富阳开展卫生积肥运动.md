Combining Sanitation and Production
Fuyang Launches a Sanitation and Manure Collection Campaign

(This newspaper reports) The Changkou District of Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, has mobilized every household and individual to launch a large-scale sanitation and manure collection campaign. From March 2nd to 9th, an average of over 22,000 people participated in this movement daily. They cleaned over 14,000 places, including cesspools, livestock pens, and garbage dumps, collected over 2.9 million dan of manure, and dug out over 4,000 jin of fly pupae. The amount of fertilizer collected exceeded 45% of the total amount of native fertilizer collected in the past five months, strongly supporting production and further changing the sanitary conditions in rural areas.

The manure collection campaign in Changkou District was launched under the personal leadership of Wang Shunquan, the Secretary of the Fuyang County Party Committee. County Party Secretary Wang Shunquan discovered that the shortage of fertilizer was widespread in Changkou District in the previous period. Although many cadres were anxious about this, they believed that the sources of fertilizer had been almost exhausted and were afraid of difficulties. In order to solve the fertilizer problem, the County Party Secretary pointed out that cadres must further change their work style and consult with production teams more often to find sources of fertilizer. He also proposed methods such as digging up cesspool mud and collecting more native fertilizer. He also selected two cesspools in the district committee office for experimentation, and it only took him more than half a day to dig out 100 dan of fertilizer. Based on this instruction, the district committee immediately organized more than 30 township and commune cadres and old farmers from Changkou Township to visit and observe. The visitors were very excited when they saw this example. That night, Changkou Commune held separate meetings for commune members, mobilizing everyone to offer ideas and find sources of fertilizer. In one night, they found eight sources of fertilizer, including digging up mud from the bottom of cattle and pig pens, garbage dumps, sewage pits, broken house foundations, broken wall corners, drainage ditches, cesspools, and kiln ash. After the meeting, more than 200 people in the commune dug up cesspool mud and garbage dump mud overnight.

Now, this movement combining sanitation and production has been widely launched in various parts of Fuyang County.

    卫生和生产相结合
    富阳开展卫生积肥运动
    本报讯　浙江省富阳县场口区户户动员，人人动手，展开了一个大规模的卫生、积肥运动。自3月2日至9日止的八天中，平均每天投入这个运动的有二万二千多人，共清理了粪坑、畜栏、垃圾堆等一万四千多处，积肥二百九十多万担，挖出蝇蛹四千多斤。所积肥料超过过去五个月所积土肥总数的45％，有力地支援了生产，并且进一步改变了农村的卫生面貌。
    场口区的积肥运动是在中共富阳县县委书记亲自领导下开展起来的。县委书记王顺泉发现场口区前一时期缺肥现象很普遍，不少干部虽然为此焦急，但认为肥源已找得差不多了，存在畏难情绪。为了解决肥源问题，县委书记指出干部须进一步转变作风，多与生产队商量，找寻肥源。他并提出了挖粪坑泥、多积土肥的办法。他还选择了区委机关的两个粪坑进行试验，只花了半天多时间，就挖出肥料一百担。区委根据这一指示，当天就组织场口乡的乡、社干部和老农三十多人前来参观。参观者看到了这一实例，都很兴奋。场口社当晚就分别召开社员会议，动员大家出主意，找肥源，一个晚上就找出了挖牛猪栏底泥、垃圾堆泥、污水坑泥、破屋基泥、破墙脚泥、阴沟泥、粪坑泥、窑沙灰等八种肥源。会后，全社二百多人连夜挖粪坑泥和垃圾堆泥。
    现在，这一卫生和生产相结合的运动，已在富阳县各地普遍开展。
