Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 2nd: According to the "Akahata" newspaper, the Japanese Communist Party held its 20th expanded Central Committee Plenary Session in Tokyo. The plenary session heard the report of Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, which was later submitted to the Party's National Activists Representative Conference. After the close of the Party's National Activists Representative Conference, the plenary session summarized the discussions held at the representative conference and unanimously adopted a resolution on the Party's tasks.

The resolution analyzed the international and domestic situations, put forward tasks for the entire party in the struggle for peace and for improving the living conditions of the working people, and explained the purpose and tasks of the democratic government. The document stated that establishing a democratic government is the party's central political task. The resolution also touched on the Japanese Communist Party's preparations for convening the Seventh Party Congress.

In the first part of the resolution – "International Situation" – it stated that the balance of international forces is now in favor of the socialist camp, and the international situation is developing in the direction of peaceful coexistence. The resolution pointed out that this confirms the correctness of the analysis of the international situation made by the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties.

The resolution went on to point out that the Moscow Conference showed the strengthening of the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the strengthening of the unity of the international communist movement, which has achieved a series of historic victories. The plenary session pointed out that the leading role in international affairs has almost completely shifted to the socialist countries.

In the "Domestic Situation" section of the resolution, the plenary session pointed out that Japan's economic recession has intensified, which has had a detrimental impact on the lives of the working people.

The resolution stated that the characteristic of the current situation in Japan is that the broad masses of working people are increasingly distrustful and dissatisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke government, and they demand that new policies be pursued and a new government be established.

The resolution emphasized the importance of the unity of the working class, strengthening the working class's organizations, raising class consciousness, and spreading Marxism-Leninism among the working masses. The resolution stated that in order to change Japan's political direction, it is necessary to expand the influence of the Japanese Communist Party and consolidate the party ranks. The plenary session pointed out that there is every reason to establish a united front between the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

The plenary session called on Communist Party members to fight for peace, demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons, oppose the entry of nuclear weapons into Japan, strive for the convening of a summit conference of great powers, and improve the people's livelihood.

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party decided to combine the preparations for holding Diet elections and participating in the election campaign, the movement for peace, with the preparations for convening the Party's Seventh Congress.

    日共中央全会提出党的中心任务
    争取和平和建立民主政府
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社东京1日讯：日本“赤旗报”消息，日本共产党在东京举行了第二十次中央委员会扩大全会。全会听取了日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三的报告，这个报告后来提交给党的全国积极分子代表会议。在党的全国积极分子代表会议闭幕以后，全会总结了代表会议上展开的讨论，并且一致通过了关于党的任务的决议。
    决议分析了国际形势和国内形势，向全党提出了在争取和平、争取改善劳动人民生活条件的斗争中的任务，说明了民主政府的宗旨和任务。这个文件说，建立民主政府是党的中心政治任务。决议还谈到日本共产党筹备召开第七次党代表大会的问题。
    决议在它的第一部分——“国际形势”部分中说，现在，国际间的力量对比有利于社会主义阵营，国际局势正向着和平共处的方向发展。决议指出，这证实了各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议对国际局势所做的分析的正确性。
    决议接着指出，莫斯科会议显示了以苏联为首的社会主义国家团结的加强，显示了已经取得一系列历史性胜利的国际共产主义运动团结的加强。全会指出，国际事务中的领导作用几乎完全转入社会主义国家手中。
    全会在决议的“国内状况”部分中指出，日本的经济衰退加剧了，它对劳动人民的生活产生了有害的影响。
    决议说，日本目前局势的特点是，广大劳动群众越来越不信任和不满岸信介政府，他们要求奉行新的政策和建立新政府。
    决议强调指出工人阶级团结、加强工人阶级的组织、提高阶级觉悟、在劳动群众中间传播马克思列宁主义思想的重要性。决议说，为了改变日本的政治方针，必须扩大日本共产党的影响，巩固党的队伍。全会指出，有一切根据来建立日本共产党和社会党之间的统一战线。
    全会号召共产党员为争取和平、要求禁止核武器、反对把核武器运进日本、争取召开大国首脑会议和改善人民生活而斗争。
    日本共产党中央委员会决定，把争取举行国会选举、参加竞选的准备工作、争取和平的运动同召开党的第七次代表大会的准备工作结合起来进行。
