Listening to Old Women Singing
        Shi Xiaowen

Speaking of International Women's Day, that evening, the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast a wonderful music program, performed by the Shenyang Old Women's Choir. The Old Women's Choir mainly consists of military families and employee families. The oldest member is sixty-four years old, and the youngest is over forty. Since the establishment of the choir in 1952, they have often performed in factories, villages, troops, and schools. Sometimes, in the cold weather, they travel in the dark, taking large carts to sing dozens of miles away. Over the past five years, they have performed more than four hundred times. In the Shenyang area, when people mention the Old Women's Choir, everyone praises them and says they are good. This time they sang six songs on the radio, singing about cooperation, singing about learning culture, singing about "Grain is our golden treasure"; they also sang two songs during the anti-Rightist period: "Who Dares to Release Poison" and "Struggle Against Rightist Elements," and finally sang "Embroidering a Happy Life." The songs have a folk song style and a flavor of the Northeast. What is especially touching is the old women's revolutionary enthusiasm. Just imagine, they have no worries about life, they have food and clothing, and they perform everywhere, regardless of the hard work. What is it for? Isn't it because they love the new society, love the Communist Party, and want to express their infinite joy in a loud song? It can both express feelings and inspire the masses. How can this kind of socialist vigor not make the younger generations admire and be inspired? Nowadays, new things are surging like tides, and all kinds of flowers are blooming, I'm afraid the old women will not be able to finish singing even when they are old. It is precisely:

        Old trees meet spring and sprout again,
        Singing time in workshops and fields;
        How much is known about good times and beautiful scenery?
        It is not surprising to sing until a hundred years old.

    听老大娘唱歌
    史晓汶
    话说三八节那天晚上，中央人民广播电台播了一段精彩的音乐节目，演唱的乃是沈阳市老大娘歌唱团。这老大娘歌唱团大都是军属和职工家属，论年纪最大的已有六十四岁，最小也在四十开外。从1952年成立歌唱团，常时到工厂、农村、部队和学校演出，有时寒天摸黑，还坐着大车赶到几十里去演唱。五年多来，已经演唱了四百多场。在沈阳地区，提起老大娘歌唱团，真是个个称赞，人人道好。这一回她们在电台唱了六支歌曲，歌唱合作化，歌唱学文化，歌唱“粮食是咱们的金疙瘩”；还唱了反右派期间的两支歌：“谁敢放毒”和“向右派分子斗争”，最后唱了“把幸福的日子绣下来”。歌有民谣风，味是关外味。尤其令人感动的，是老大娘的一片革命热情。试想她们生活无愁，衣食有着，不辞辛苦地到处演出，为的何来？还不是因为热爱新社会，热爱共产党，要把无限欢欣，尽付放声一唱。既可抒述情怀，又能鼓舞群众。这种社会主义干劲，怎不叫青年后辈又敬佩，又振奋？如今新事如潮，万花似锦，只怕老大娘们唱到老还唱不完哩。正是：
    老树逢春又发枝，
    车间陌上放歌时；
    良辰美景知多少？
    唱到期颐不足奇。
