Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 19th: Although there are still more than half a year before the winter sowing of wheat, the preparatory work for striving for another leap forward in wheat production next year has already begun in the Party and government leading departments of Xiangyang Special District, a major wheat-producing area in Hubei Province.

This year, the wheat in Xiangyang Special District is growing very well. If there are no unexpected disasters, there is a high hope that the output will double compared to last year. Can we continue to have a great leap forward next year? How to achieve a great leap forward? In order to answer this question, the leaders of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County Committees of the Communist Party of China in the seven major wheat-producing counties in the district recently held mobile front-line meetings in the major wheat-producing counties to conduct on-the-spot investigations and research. The conclusion they reached from field observation and research is: it is entirely possible to have another leap forward next year; the basic method to achieve another leap forward is to increase land utilization, that is, to implement wide-row drilling or cross-row drilling to increase the number of plants planted per unit area.

According to the situation in Xiangyang Special District, in the past, wheat was generally sown by broadcasting, with only 70,000 to 80,000 plants per mu, and the yield per mu was only a few dozen to a hundred catties; after the implementation of general drilling, there were generally more than 100,000 plants per mu, and the yield per mu reached about 200 catties; all those with a yield of more than 500 catties or even 1,000 catties per mu were either wide-row drilled or cross-row drilled, with more than 400,000 plants per mu. Now, many experimental fields with more than 700,000 plants per mu have good wheat growth. This year, the average wheat per mu in the entire district is more than 200,000 plants, and it is estimated that the yield per mu may reach 300 catties. If the number of plants per mu can be increased to 400,000 to 700,000 next year, the yield per mu is expected to increase to 400 to 500 catties.

The leading cadres of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, through repeated investigations, believe that while increasing the number of plants per unit area, it is also necessary to apply fertilizer reasonably and implement deep plowing. They believe that the current situation of the wheat varieties being too singular should be changed, and some wheat varieties with strong fertilizer resistance should be selected.

In order to implement the spirit of early preparation to the broad masses, each county, according to the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, is preparing to organize village branch secretaries, cooperative directors, and production team leaders to visit and study in Gucheng County, where the wheat is growing very well, and immediately begin to deliberate among the masses, so as to fully prepare for the great leap forward next year.

### 明年小麦生产能不能再跃进？  襄阳专区领导干部深入田间找到了答案

    明年小麦生产能不能再跃进？
    襄阳专区领导干部深入田间找到了答案
    新华社武汉19日电　现在离小麦冬播的时间还有大半年，但是争取明年小麦生产再跃进的准备工作，已在湖北省主要产麦区——襄阳专区的党、政领导部门中开始进行。
    今年襄阳专区的小麦长得很好，如果不遇意外灾害，产量比去年增产一倍的希望很大。明年能否继续大跃进？如何大跃进？为了回答这个问题，中共襄阳地委和专区内七个主要产麦县中共县委的领导人，最近在各主要产麦县开了流动战地会，作了实地调查研究。他们从实地观察研究中得出的结论是：明年再来一个跃进是完全可能的；实现再跃进的基本办法是提高土地利用率，即实行宽幅条播或交叉条播，增加单位面积的种植株数。
    根据襄阳专区的情况，过去种小麦一般都是撒播，每亩只植七万到八万株，亩产量只几十斤到百把斤；实现一般条播后，一般每亩十多万株，亩产量达到二百斤左右；凡是亩产量达到五百斤以上甚至一千斤的，不是宽幅条播就是交叉条播，每亩都在四十万株以上。现在许多每亩达到七十万株以上的试验田，小麦生长情况都很好。今年，全专区的小麦平均每亩在二十万株以上，估计亩产量可能达到三百斤。如果明年能使每亩增加到四十万到七十万株，亩产量可望提高到四百到五百斤。
    中共襄阳地委的领导干部通过反复调查，认为在增加单位面积种植株数的同时，还要合理施肥和实行深耕。他们认为应改变小麦品种单一化的现状，选用些耐肥性较强的麦种。
    为了把早作准备的精神贯彻到广大群众中去，各县根据地委的指示，正准备组织乡支部书记、合作社主任和生产队长等，到小麦生长情况很好的谷城县去参观、学习，并且立即开始在群众中酝酿，以便充分地把各项准备工作做好，为明年大跃进创造条件。
