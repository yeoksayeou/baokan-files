    Industry Goes to the Mountains
    By Our Correspondents Guo Fenxiang and Sun Jing
    We made an unusual visit to a remote small county named Huichuan in the mountainous area of Gansu Province. Over the past week, from what we have seen, heard, and come into contact with, we have keenly felt that with the upsurge of water conservancy construction and manure accumulation in rural areas, a new wave of factories going to the mountains and the countryside is rapidly forming like a sudden storm.

    The Wishes of the Peasants
    Huichuan County covers an area of 2,000 square kilometers with a population of only 100,000. It is sparsely populated but rich in resources. Here, rainfall is abundant, eight rivers run through the entire area, and the mountains are covered with fertile black calcium soil, producing grains, oil crops, and fiber crops. Due to the shortage of labor, in the past, sugar beets were planted by broadcasting without fertilization, watering, or weeding, and the yield per mu still reached as high as 2,000 jin. The southern high mountains and ridges are lush with economic forests and timber forests, where rare birds and animals such as deer and musk deer roam everywhere. The Tao River and Manba River are rich in placer gold.

    In the past, without local industry, many valuable resources could not be utilized. Huichuan County has tens of thousands of mu of flax. The seeds are used for oil extraction, and the remaining flax stalks can be peeled to produce flax fiber, which is a good textile raw material. Because there was no flax processing factory in the past, peasants peeled flax by hand, which could only produce one jin per day, making it not worth the effort. They had to burn the flax stalks as firewood, which was equivalent to losing millions of feet of linen cloth every year. In 1947, the peasants here began to grow sugar beets, preparing to make sugar. Because there was no sugar factory, the peasants boiled the harvested sugar beets in small pots. Due to the lack of necessary production equipment and experience, several trials failed. This kind of sugar beet with a very high sugar content had to be eaten as vegetables, while the sugar they ate had to be bought from other places. At that time, as long as a few sugar beet farmers got together, they could hear a common sigh: When will we have a sugar factory in our mountains!

    After liberation, agriculture in Huichuan County developed rapidly, and the enthusiasm of the peasants became greater and greater. In order to basically realize water conservancy throughout the county this year, they are opening mountains and digging ridges, diverting water to the mountains, and transforming hundreds of thousands of mu of dry land into irrigated land. However, the large amount of explosives needed for opening mountains and blasting rocks had to be transported from other places, and work was often stopped due to untimely supply. Some mountains have already built irrigated land, and the peasants eagerly hope to build power plants as soon as possible so that they can use electric irrigation and drainage machinery to water the land. After the peasants adopted new-style agricultural implements in large quantities, because there was no agricultural implement repair factory locally, often because of the damage of individual parts or even the lack of one or two screws, many double-wheeled double-blade plows and mountain plows became "hanging plows." In the rural socialist ideological education and great debate carried out not long ago, the peasants reflected one after another: The high tide of agricultural production requires industry to go to the countryside and the mountains, to establish small factories in the countryside, and to supply us with more and more timely means of production and means of livelihood.

    Factories Begin to Go to the Mountains
    What is now presented to us is a thriving scene. Almost every township is preparing to build factories, and simple farmhouses are hung with signs such as "×× Factory" and "×× Factory Preparatory Office". The sound of mountain-opening cannons rumbles from time to time, and heroic peasants are blasting stubborn rocks to divert water to the mountains. On the side of the mountain, another group of peasants are smearing mud and plastering ash, transforming ordinary farmhouses into factory buildings. When peasants coming from the east and going to the west meet, they can often hear such dialogues: "When will your township's gold panning factory start?" "Soon, how many factories are you going to build this year?" In Chengguan Township, hundreds of cadres and masses are building a hydropower station through voluntary labor to solve the power problems for the small flour mill and agricultural implement repair factory. The Industry and Transportation Department of the CPC County Committee, which had been abolished the year before last because there was not much work to do, has recently established an "Industry Office".

    This county is developing local industry in accordance with the principles of "making do with whatever is available" and "production first, construction later," using civilian houses to be converted into factory buildings; eating and living are contracted to agricultural cooperatives to solve, without first setting up living welfare facilities; starting with simple machinery or manual production first, and then purchasing machines later. Therefore, the investment is small, and it can be put into production quickly. In the past month or so, eight factories, including a gunpowder factory, a brick and tile lime factory, and a flax processing factory, have been partially put into production. The flax processing factory can now process about 3,000 jin of flax stalks every day. Soon, more than ten machines can be put into full production. At that time, millions of jin of flax stalks in the county, which were originally to be burned as firewood, can all be used as textile raw materials. The cured meat canning factory, the cured meat part of which has been put into production, is produced manually, with simple equipment and low cost. It is estimated that the profits within a few months will be enough to buy a complete set of equipment for making canned food. After the canned food part is put into production this summer, various kinds of game canned food such as wild boar, deer, and pheasant can be transported and sold to various places.

    Promoters of New Things
    In December last year, after criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee, the CPC Huichuan County decided to break with convention, give full play to the potential of the mountainous area, vigorously develop local industry, so that agriculture and industry can both make great leaps forward, and completely change the face of the mountainous area in a few years. On the one hand, they sent people to investigate the resources of economic crops, forests, minerals, etc. in various parts of the county, and solicited the opinions of peasants on running local industries; on the other hand, they learned about the number of people with craftsmanship and their technical level from handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. Based on the resource situation, the enthusiasm of the masses, and the level that can be reached through efforts in technology as prerequisites, the county party committee held four meetings, and after repeated deliberation, decided to build 75 small factories such as sugar factories, vermicelli factories, paper mills, gold panning factories, and flax processing factories this year, so that every township in the county would have factories, and put forward the policy of from small to large, from manual production to mechanization, and production first, construction later. The construction of these factories only requires 780,000 yuan, and the working capital for production is 800,000 yuan. They can all be built and put into production this year. The total output value of local industry this year is 8.29 million yuan, which is 55% of the planned output value of agriculture and sideline industries in the county this year. The profit of these 75 factories this year is estimated to be about 3.7 million yuan. The initial investment in the construction of the factories can be fully recovered this year, and funds can be accumulated for future expansion and the implementation of factory production mechanization.

    All factories use local raw materials, and most of the products are also sold locally. Another part of the products, such as gold and flax, are important materials purchased by the state. The CPC County Committee considered that sugar is a best-selling product, the state needs it, and the local climate and geography are completely suitable for the sugar industry, so it decided to build 20 indigenous sugar factories this year. The cured meat canning factory also decided to set up a factory based on the letters from food departments in Tianjin and other places requesting goods, confirming that there were no difficulties in sales.

    Then, the CPC County Committee and the County People's Committee decided to transfer more than 40 capable cadres, including members of the County Committee, section chiefs, bureau chiefs, and district committee secretaries, to engage in industry. Zhang Kexun, secretary of the County Committee, personally served as the director of the Industry Office, taking charge of the overall situation. The vast number of cadres also responded to the call of the Party Committee, and while requesting to go to the mountains and the countryside to participate in agricultural labor, they posted big-character posters applying to go to the factories as workers. At present, a new atmosphere of studying industrial knowledge has emerged among these rural cadres. The county is going to build two honey factories this year. When Xinhua Bookstore transported a batch of books on beekeeping, they were immediately snapped up by everyone. Wu Qingshan, a member of the County Committee, is over sixty years old, and he also actively requested to transfer to engage in industry. The County Committee has approved him to be the director of the newly established honey factory. He knew that a beekeeping expert was passing through here, so he quickly went to visit and ask for advice.

    The Power of the Masses is an Exhaustible Source
    To turn the beautiful plan of developing local industry into reality, another extremely important issue is funding. The CPC Huichuan County Committee pointed out when analyzing the root causes of right-leaning conservative thinking: in the past, we only relied on state investment, and did not see the huge potential of the masses, so we could not develop local industry in the past. Now we must rely on the power of the masses to raise funds to universally run factories. This slogan, like a spring breeze blowing across the wilderness, quickly ignited a high tide of mass fundraising in the county. Puli Township, with only 407 households, raised 39,000 yuan in just over a month, with an average of nearly 100 yuan per household. He Ruiying, a woman from Xigou Township, had four silver dollars that she had wrapped in several layers of cloth and hidden when she got married ten years ago, which she had never used. This time, she also automatically took them out to raise funds for the development of industry. Many people also vacated empty houses as factory buildings. Zhongzhaiji Township needs dozens of iron pots to build a sugar factory this year. After the peasants learned about it, they took out their surplus iron pots one after another. Mass fundraising was universally launched in the county in January this year. In more than a month, in addition to raising the funds needed for water conservancy construction, the peasants in the county also overfulfilled the 700,000 yuan needed for the development of industry. At the oath-taking conference attended by tens of thousands of peasants on February 11, representatives of peasants from various townships also proposed to invest by townships and cooperatives to build dozens more small factories this year, to ensure that the output value of local industry in the county will exceed the output value of agriculture next year.

    工业上山
    本报记者　郭汾祥　孙晶
    我们到甘肃省山区一个名叫会川的荒僻小县进行了一次不寻常的访问。一个多星期来，我们从看到的、听到的和接触到的，敏锐地感觉到：随着农村中兴修水利和积肥的生产高潮的出现，一个工厂上山、下乡的新浪潮，正在急云骤雨般地迅速形成中。
    农民的愿望
    会川县面积二千平方公里，人口只有十万，地广人稀，物产却很丰富。这里雨量充沛，八条河流横贯全境，山地上复盖着肥沃的黑钙土，出产粮食、油料作物和纤维作物。在劳动力不足的情况下，过去种甜菜采取不施肥、不浇水、不除草的撒播耕作方法，每亩产量还有高达二千斤的。南部高山大岭是一片苍郁的经济林和材料林，鹿、麝等珍禽异兽到处奔跑。洮河和漫巴河盛产砂金。
    过去在没有地方工业的情况下，许多宝贵的资源没法利用。会川县共种有数万亩亚麻，籽用来榨油，剩下的亚麻秆可以剥制麻纤维，是很好的纺织原料。因为过去没有亚麻加工厂，农民用手工剥麻，一天只能剥一斤，得不偿失，只好把亚麻秆当柴火烧掉，每年等于损失几百万尺亚麻布。1947年，这里的农民开始种植甜菜，准备制糖。因为没有糖厂，农民把收获的甜菜用小锅熬制。因为缺少必要的生产设备，又没有经验，几次试制，都失败了。这种含糖率很高的甜菜只得当蔬菜吃掉，自己吃的糖却要到外地去买。那时只要几个种甜菜的农民碰在一起，就可以听到共同的叹息声：什么时候我们山里能有一座制糖厂！
    解放以后，会川县的农业得到了迅速的发展，农民的干劲愈来愈大。他们为了在今年内基本实现全县水利化，正在开山凿岭，引水上山，把数十万亩旱地改建成水地。但是开山炸石所需要的大量炸药却要从外地运来，时常因为供应不及时而停工待料。有些山上已经修起水地，农民迫切期望早日建设发电厂，以便用电动排灌机械来浇地。农民们大量采用新式农具以后，因为本地没有农具修配厂，往往因为损坏个别零件甚至缺少一、二个螺丝，不少双轮双铧犁和山地步犁竟变成“挂犁”。在不久前开展的农村社会主义思想教育和大辩论中，农民们纷纷反映道：农业生产的高潮要求工业下乡、上山，在农村建立小工厂，更多更及时地供给我们生产资料和生活资料。
    工厂开始上山
    现在呈现在我们眼前的是一幅欣欣向荣的景象。几乎每个乡里都在筹建工厂，朴素的农舍上挂起了“××工厂”、“××厂筹建处”的牌子。山顶上开山炮不时轰鸣，英雄的农民在炸开顽石，引水上山。山边上，另一部分农民却在涂泥抹灰，把普通的农房改建成厂房。东来西往的农民相遇时，时常可以听到这样的对话：“你们乡上的淘金厂什么时候开工？”“快了，你们那里今年办几个厂子？”在城关乡，数百个干部和群众在用义务劳动修建水电站，为小型面粉厂、农具修配厂争先解决动力问题。中共县委的工业交通部过去因为没有多少工作可办，已在前年撤销，最近又成立起“工业办公室”来。
    这个县按照“因陋就简”和“先生产、后建设”的方针发展地方工业，利用民房改建成厂房；吃、住方面包给农业社解决，不先办生活福利设施；开始先用简单机械或手工生产，以后再添购机器。因此投资少，并能很快投入生产。一个多月来，已经有火药厂、砖瓦石灰厂、亚麻加工厂等八座工厂部分投入生产。亚麻加工厂现在每天可以加工三千斤左右的亚麻秆，不久，十多台机器就可以全部投入生产，那时候，全县原来要当柴烧的数百万斤亚麻秆，就可全部用来作纺织原料。腌腊罐头厂，已投入生产的腌腊部分，是用手工生产的，设备简单，成本很低，预计几个月内的赢利就足够买做罐头用的全套设备。今年夏季罐头部分投入生产以后，就可以把野猪、鹿、野鸡等各种野味罐头运销各地。
    新事物的促进派
    去年12月，中共会川县根据中共八届三中全会精神，批判了右倾保守思想之后，决定打破常规，充分发挥山区潜力，大力发展地方工业，使农业和工业都能大跃进，几年内彻底改变山区的面貌。他们一方面派人在县内各地调查经济作物、森林、矿产等资源情况，征求农民对举办地方工业的意见；另一方面从手工业社、农业社中了解有手艺的人数以及技术水平等情况。根据资源情况、群众积极性和技术上经过努力可能达到的水平为先决条件，县委召开了四次会议，经过反复酝酿，决定今年建设糖厂、粉条厂、造纸厂、淘金厂、亚麻加工厂等七十五个小型工厂，做到全县乡乡有工厂，并提出了由小到大、从手工生产到机械化和先生产后建设的方针。建设这些工厂只需七十八万元，生产流动资金为八十万元，今年内可以全部建成投入生产。本年度的地方工业总产值为八百二十九万元，为今年全县农业和农副业计划产值的55％。这七十五个厂子今年的赢利预计约为三百七十万元，初期建厂投资今年内就可全部收回来，还可以为今后扩建和实行工厂生产机械化积累资金。
    所有的工厂就地取用原料，绝大部分产品也是就地销售。另外一部分产品如金、亚麻等都是国家收购的重要物资。中共县委考虑到食糖是畅销货，国家需要而本地的天时、地利又完全适合制糖业，所以决定今年建设二十个土糖厂，腌腊罐头厂也是根据天津等地食品部门来信需货，证实销路没有困难才决定设厂的。
    接着，中共县委和县人民委员会决定抽调包括县委委员、科长、局长、区委书记等得力干部四十多人转业搞工业。县委书记张克熏亲自担任工业办公室主任职务，掌握全面。广大干部也响应党委的号召，在要求上山、下乡参加农业劳动的同时，贴出大字报申请到工厂里去当工人。目前，在这些农村干部中已经出现了钻研工业知识的新风气。县上今年要建设两个蜂蜜厂，当新华书店运到一批养蜂的书籍时，立刻被大家争购一空。县委委员吴青山已经六十多岁，还积极要求转业搞工业。县委已批准他去当新办的蜂蜜厂厂长。他知道有关新法炼蜜能手经过这里，就赶紧登门去请教。
    群众力量是不尽的泉源
    要把发展地方工业的美好计划变为现实，另一个极重要的问题就是资金。中共会川县委在分析右倾保守思想的根源时指出：过去只单纯依赖国家投资，看不到群众的巨大潜力，因此过去无法发展地方工业。现在就是要依靠群众力量，集资普遍兴办工厂。这个口号像春风吹野火，迅速在全县燃起一个群众集资高潮。只有四百零七户的铺里乡，一个多月就集三万九千元，平均每户集资几近一百元。西沟乡的妇女何瑞英，十年前出嫁时用好几层布包好藏着的四块银洋，从未动用，这次也自动拿出来集资兴办工业。不少人家还腾出空屋当厂房。中寨集乡今年建设糖厂需要数十个铁锅，农民们知道后，就纷纷把多余的铁锅拿出来。群众集资是今年元月份普遍在全县展开的，一个多月来，全县农民在筹齐兴修水利所需的资金外，又超额完成了发展工业所需的七十万元资金。在2月11日数万农民参加的誓师大会上，各乡农民代表又提出了今年由乡、社投资再增建几十个小工厂，保证明年全县地方工业产值超过农业产值。
