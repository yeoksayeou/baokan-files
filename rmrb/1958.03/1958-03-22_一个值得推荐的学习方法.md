    A Recommended Learning Method
    Yi Huai
    Cadres in Pingli County, Shaanxi Province, have proposed a learning competition initiative to cadres throughout the province. This is a very good initiative. It is good because with a leap forward in cadre learning, there is a guarantee of a great leap forward in production and work. The benefit of this initiative is not just this; it also points out a good method for on-the-job cadre learning, which is: learning for application, combining learning with application.
    The ten articles in their initiative not only stipulate that cadres should learn theory, professional skills, technology, and culture, but also assign a use to each type of learning. For example, cultivating experimental plots provides a practical opportunity to learn technology; coming up with good ideas, summarizing experiences, and writing articles for newspapers and periodicals require not only analyzing and researching the actual situation, but also using the theoretical, professional, and cultural knowledge that has already been learned. Combining learning and application can not only promote work, but also promote learning. Having learned technology, the experimental plots can be cultivated better; having cultivated experimental plots, done typical investigations, and summarized experiences, one can learn more practical knowledge and enrich the knowledge learned from books. Or, when encountering problems in practice, everyone goes to study the knowledge in books. In this way, everyone becomes more and more interested in learning, and more and more energetic, and learning becomes an indispensable part of life, just like eating.
    This method of combining learning and work is not only suitable for comrades with low theoretical and cultural levels, but also for comrades with high theoretical and cultural levels; it is not only suitable for comrades doing local work, but also for comrades doing other work. Having learned technology, it should be used as a tool to cultivate experimental plots well and lead production well; having learned dialectics, it should also be used as a weapon to analyze things and improve leadership methods. Otherwise, even if one reads a lot of books, one can only memorize some articles and sentences, and one will still lack sharp weapons to solve practical problems. This kind of dogmatic learning can only cultivate bookworms, and it is difficult to cultivate promoters in the Great Leap Forward.

    一个值得推荐的学习方法
    易槐
    陕西省平利县干部向全省干部提出了学习竞赛倡议。这是一个很好的倡议。说它好，是因为有了干部学习上的跃进，生产和工作的大跃进就有了保证。这个倡议的好处还不只是这一点，它还给在职干部的学习，指出了一个好办法，就是：学以致用，学用结合。
    他们倡议中的十条既规定了干部要学理论、学业务、学技术、学文化，而且还给每一种学习都派了用场。比如，种试验田，这就给学技术找到了实践的机会；出好主意、总结经验、给报刊写稿子，这就不但要分析研究实际情况，还得用一用已经学得的理论、业务、文化知识。学和用结合起来了，不但可以促进工作，而且可以促进学习。学了技术，试验田可以种得更好；种了试验田，做了典型调查，总结了经验，又可以学得更多实际的知识，丰富了从书本上学到的知识。或者是在实践中碰到了问题，大家又去钻研书本上的知识。这样，大家越学越有兴趣，越学越有劲，学习也就像吃饭一样成为生活中一件不可缺少的事情。
    这种学习和工作结合的方法，不但适用于理论、文化水平不太高的同志，也适用于理论文化水平较高的同志；不但适用于做地方工作的同志，也适用于做其他工作的同志，学了技术，就要把它用做种好试验田领导好生产的工具；学了辩证法，也要把它用做分析事物改进领导方法的武器。不然，即使书读得再多，那也只能记诵些条文辞句，手里仍然会缺乏解决实际问题的锐利武器。这种教条主义式的学习，只能培养出书呆子，而很难培养出大跃进中的促进派。
