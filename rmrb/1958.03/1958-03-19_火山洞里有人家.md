    People Live in Volcanic Caves
    In the Gurimei Valley and neighboring areas in the Anatolian Plateau of central Turkey, there is a large area of extinct volcanoes. Due to weathering and rain erosion, over the years, these volcanoes have turned into conical hills. There are few trees here and timber is scarce. Local residents adapt to local conditions. They cut open the volcanic rock of the hills and build houses to live in. The photo shows a three-story residence.

    火山洞里有人家
    在土耳其的安那托利亚高原中部的古里密山谷和邻近地区，是一大片熄灭了的火山群。由于风化和雨水侵蚀冲刷，年深月久，这些火山变成了一个个的圆锥形小丘。这里树木很少，木材奇缺，当地居民因地制宜，他们凿开小丘的火山岩，修成楼房居住。照片上的是一座三层的住宅。
