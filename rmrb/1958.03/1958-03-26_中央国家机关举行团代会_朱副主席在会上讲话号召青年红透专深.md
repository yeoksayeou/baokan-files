Xinhua News Agency, March 25th. The Third Congress of the Communist Youth League of Central State Organs, focusing on discussions about how the League members and youth of the central state organs can be good promoters of the revolution and how the work of the League in the organs can achieve a great leap forward, was held in Beijing from the 19th to the 24th.

Vice-Chairman Zhu De spoke at the meeting. He encouraged the League members and youth of the organs to unite more closely around the Party amidst the overwhelming socialist construction upsurge of the people nationwide. They should combine politics with technology, zeal with perseverance, be energetic, and work hard, playing a leading and promoting role in various construction tasks.

Vice-Chairman Zhu said that the youth of the organs must first establish a proletarian ideology, firmly stand on the working-class position, eliminate bourgeois ideology, and abandon the bourgeois position. In this struggle, they must rely on the leadership of the Party, the League, and the administration, as well as the help of comrades. Equally important is to rely on their own conscious and automatic efforts. The best way to strengthen political and ideological work and to strengthen political and ideological training is to guide young people to participate in the actual struggles of socialist revolution and socialist construction, participate in various political movements, and participate in labor training. Only in various actual struggles and production labor, and in combination with the broad masses, especially the worker and peasant masses, can they jump out of the small circle of individualism and enter the great world of communism, and only then can they advance victoriously on the road of socialism and communism.

Vice-Chairman Zhu hoped that the youth of the organs would not become empty political theorists who are only red but not expert, or pragmatists who are only expert but lose their direction, but should strive to be both red and expert, and even more red and more expert, to achieve a thorough understanding of both redness and expertise, and regard the combination of redness and expertise as a lifelong and glorious task of self-transformation.

Bao Yishan, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Central State Organs, pointed out in his report that in order for League members and youth in the organs to be good promoters of the revolution, they must make a great leap forward in thought, work, and study, and become "both red and expert" insiders or experts in their respective fields. The League organizations must implement the ideological work line of "promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie," continue to earnestly mobilize young people to participate in the rectification movement, and at the same time educate League members and youth to consciously participate in labor training to further improve their socialist consciousness. The League organizations must also rectify the League ranks, improve their work style and methods, so that the work of the League in the organs can also achieve a great leap forward.

The 770 delegates present discussed and unanimously adopted the "Forty Articles of the Outline for the Great Leap Forward of the Work of the Communist Youth League in the Central State Organs." This outline requires the League organizations of the organs to guide young people to work hard for three years to become working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, and even more red and more expert.

During the meeting, Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, Gong Zirong, First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Central State Organs, and Wang Wei, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, all attended and spoke.

    中央国家机关举行团代会
    朱副主席在会上讲话号召青年红透专深
    新华社25日讯　以讨论中央国家机关共青团员和青年如何当好革命促进派、机关团的工作如何大跃进等问题为中心议题的共青团中央国家机关第三次代表大会，19日到24日在北京举行。
    朱德副主席在会上讲了话。朱副主席勉励机关共青团员和青年，在当前全国人民排山倒海般的社会主义建设高潮中，更紧密地团结在党的周围，政治加技术，干劲加钻劲，生气勃勃，艰苦顽强，在各项建设工作中，起带头和促进作用。
    朱副主席说，机关青年首先要树立无产阶级思想，站稳工人阶级立场，消灭资产阶级思想，抛弃资产阶级立场。在这场斗争中，一方面要依靠党、团、行政的领导和同志们的帮助，但同样重要的是要依靠自己自觉自动的努力。加强政治思想工作和加强政治思想锻炼的最好方法，是引导青年参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实际斗争，参加各种政治运动和参加劳动锻炼。只有在各种实际斗争、生产劳动中，和广大群众特别是和工农群众相结合，才能使自己跳出个人主义的小圈子，走到共产主义的大天地中来，才能在社会主义和共产主义的道路上胜利前进。
    朱副主席希望机关青年不要做只红不专的空头政治家，或只专不红的迷失方向的实际家，而要做到又红又专、更红更专，做到红透专深，把红与专作为终身奋斗的自我改造的光荣任务。
    中央国家机关团委书记鲍奕珊在会上所作的报告中指出，机关中的团员和青年要当好革命促进派，就必须在思想、工作、学习上来个大跃进，成为本行本业“又红又专”的内行或专家。团组织要贯彻“兴无灭资”的思想工作路线，继续认真发动青年参加整风运动，同时要教育团员和青年自觉地参加劳动锻炼，进一步提高社会主义觉悟；团组织还要整顿团的队伍、改进工作作风和方法，使机关团的工作也来一个大跃进。
    到会的七百七十名代表讨论并一致通过了“中央国家机关共青团的工作大跃进纲要四十条”。这个纲要要求机关团组织引导青年苦战三年，成为又红又专、更红更专的工人阶级知识分子。
    会议期间，国务院秘书长习仲勋、中央国家机关党委第一书记龚子荣、共青团中央书记处书记王伟都到会讲话。
