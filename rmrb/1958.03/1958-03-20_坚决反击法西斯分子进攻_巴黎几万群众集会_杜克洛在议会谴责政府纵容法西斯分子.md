Xinhua News Agency, March 19th dispatch: According to TASS, Paris, March 18th: Tens of thousands of working people in Paris held a massive anti-fascist rally at the Winter Velodrome on the evening of the 18th. The rally was jointly initiated by the French Communist Party, the General Confederation of Labor, the Progressive Republican Union, the Left-Wing Socialist Union, and the National Association of Former French Resistance Fighters. When the leaders of these progressive parties and people's organizations entered the venue, the audience applauded warmly and shouted: "Down with fascism!"

The meeting was presided over by Moulec. Pierre Cot represented the Progressive Republican Union, Duclos represented the Communist Party, Markin represented the Left-Wing Socialist Union, Nuvou represented the National Association of Former French Resistance Fighters, and Flachon represented the General Confederation of Labor, all delivering speeches at the meeting. They all called for strengthening the forces of republican democracy and resolutely counterattacking the fascist attacks on democratic freedoms.

All streets leading to the velodrome were filled with police and gendarmes. It is said that this was to "prevent possible unruly actions."

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th dispatch: According to TASS, Paris: The French National Assembly barely passed a "vote of confidence" requested by the government on the issue of amending the constitution by 282 votes to 196. The government requested this vote of confidence in order to force the National Assembly to overturn its amendment to the government bill regarding procedural matters. After the vote of confidence is passed, the government's bill on amending the constitution will be re-examined by the parliamentary committees and then submitted to the National Assembly for discussion.

Before the vote, representatives of various parties spoke to explain their party's attitude. Representatives of the parties participating in the government hinted that although they disagreed on many aspects of the above bill, they would vote for confidence to avoid a government crisis.

The spokesperson of the far-right party tried his best to defend the fascist demonstration held by the police in front of the National Assembly on March 13, while the representatives of the left-wing parties strongly criticized this action.

Communist Party member Duclos made a clear-cut speech. He emphasized the anti-democratic nature of the constitutional amendment bill, saying that this bill only benefits the enemies of the Republic. When talking about the police's anti-parliamentary demonstration, Duclos demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Bouchier-Mounoury and demanded that those who secretly or openly instigate sabotage activities be punished.

Duclos said that due to the authorities' tolerance, fascists are constantly intensifying their activities. The activities of various fascist groups and military organizations are becoming increasingly rampant. All of this creates conditions for political adventures. Duclos declared that the Communist Party would vote against the government.

    坚决反击法西斯分子进攻
    巴黎几万群众集会
    杜克洛在议会谴责政府纵容法西斯分子
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎18日讯：巴黎劳动人民数万人18日晚间在冬季赛车场举行了声势浩大的反法西斯大会。这个大会是由法国共产党、总工会、进步共和联盟、左翼社会主义联盟和前法国抵抗运动战士全国协会共同发起的。当这些进步政党和人民团体的领导人步入会场时，全场热烈鼓掌，高呼：“打倒法西斯！”
    大会由穆莱克主持。皮埃尔·戈特代表进步共和联盟、杜克洛代表共产党、马尔金代表左翼社会主义联盟、努伏代表前法国抵抗运动战士全国协会、弗拉商代表总工会，先后在会上发表了演说。他们都号召加强共和民主的力量，坚决反击法西斯分子对民主自由的进攻。
    通向赛车场的各条街道都布满了警察和宪兵。据说，这为了所谓“防止可能发生的不轨行动”。
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会以二百八十二票对一百九十六票勉强通过了政府在修改宪法的问题上所要求的一次“信任”票。政府要求举行这次信任投票，是因为要迫使国民议会推翻它对政府法案中有关程序问题的规定所作的修正。信任票通过后，政府关于修改宪法的法案将交议会各委员会重新审查，然后再提交国民议会讨论。
    在表决之前，各党派的代表都发言说明本党的态度。参加政府各政党的代表暗示，虽然他们在许多方面不同意上述法案，但是他们将投信任票，以避免政府危机爆发。
    极右翼党派的发言人竭力替3月13日警察在国民议会前面举行的法西斯示威行动进行辩解，而左翼党派的代表则猛烈抨击这种行动。
    共产党议员杜克洛作了态度鲜明的发言。他着重指出了修改宪法法案的反民主性质，他说，这个法案只对共和国的敌人有利。杜克洛在谈到警察的反议会示威行动时要求内政部长布歇—莫努里辞职，并且要求惩办那些暗地里或者公开地鼓动破坏活动的人。
    杜克洛说，由于当局的纵容，法西斯分子正在不断加紧活动。各种法西斯团体和军事组织的活动日益猖狂。这一切都为政治冒险创造了条件。杜克洛声明，共产党将投票反对政府。
