Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 13th. Tibetan and Han cadres working arduously in the Ali region of western Tibet are actively implementing the spirit of "building the country through diligence and thrift" during the rectification movement. They have put forward many proposals to save funds for the state in various ways.

The Ali Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party originally planned to build several thousand square meters of new houses this year. After studying during the rectification movement, the cadres unanimously proposed to stop construction. They decided to repair the existing old earthen houses with their own hands and live in them for a few more years, saving 590,000 yuan in housing construction costs for the construction most needed by the motherland. Cadres from various agencies in Ali have also recently drawn up plans to grow vegetables on a large scale, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables throughout the year.

    藏汉干部倡议节约
    本报特约新华社拉萨13日电  西藏西部阿里地区艰苦工作的藏、汉族干部，在整风运动中积极贯彻“勤俭建国”的精神，提出许多倡议，从各方面为国家节省资金。
    中共阿里分工委原先计划今年要修建数千平方公尺的新房屋，干部们经过整风学习以后一致提出停止修建。他们决定用自己的双手，把现有的旧土房修补好，再住几年，节省下五十九万元的房屋修建费，用到祖国最需要的建设中去。阿里各机关的干部最近还订出计划，决心大量种菜，争取今年内做到全年蔬菜自给。
