Starting from "Tension"
Yi Qin

Now, the situation of the Great Leap Forward is pressing, and work tasks are especially heavy. The work of many cadres and employees in government offices and enterprises is very tense. Some people ask: Is this kind of tension good? We say: Good! We are doing revolution! Work should be more tense. If it isn't tense, it is not called revolution, but a decline in revolutionary will.

However, we cannot simply applaud this tense situation; we must also make some specific investigations and analyses: Is it tension within normal working hours? Or is it tension that requires working overtime? Because those who are engaged in tense labor are people, and long-term overtime work will damage people's health, which is not allowed in our society today. What should we do? There are solutions. Let's analyze the reasons for the tension! In addition to the fact that the political, ideological, and professional levels of cadres and employees cannot keep up with the needs of the tasks at once, another very important reason is that our tasks have become heavier and larger, while labor organization and working methods remain the same. Labor organization and working methods are originally certain specific measures taken to complete tasks. Therefore, they must be adapted to the tasks in order to complete the tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. If the tasks are advanced, but the methods of completing the tasks are backward, and relying on backward working methods to complete advanced tasks, it will inevitably form sharp contradictions. The situation in many of our government offices and enterprises is precisely like this. There are only two ways to resolve this contradiction. Some government offices and enterprises simply want cadres and employees to increase labor intensity and work overtime. This is not a good approach, but a stupid one, and we do not advocate this approach. Because it is neither sustainable nor advisable. However, some government offices and enterprises do not simply use tense labor to overcome this contradiction, but try to improve labor organization and improve working methods so that they are adapted to the new tasks. The Finance and Accounting Department of the Hardware Import Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is doing just this. During the Great Leap Forward, they rationally adjusted manpower and improved working methods. As a result, the excessively tense situation of working overtime has changed, and the work tasks have been completed equally well.

However, it must be said that, like the laws of development of all things, the situation in which working methods, labor organization, and work tasks are adapted to each other is not permanent. Taking the Finance and Accounting Department of the Hardware Company as an example, after a period of time, when their tasks become heavier and larger, the working methods and labor organization that have been changed today will no longer be adapted, and new contradictions will arise again, and there will be tension again. The solution is still to continuously improve working methods and continuously improve labor organization. In this way, constantly generating contradictions and constantly resolving contradictions, our work can continue to leap forward.

    从“紧张”谈起
    宜勤
    现在，大跃进的形势逼人，工作任务格外加重，许多机关、企业干部和职工的工作都很紧张。有人问：这样紧张好不好？我们说：好！干革命么！工作应该紧张些，不紧张，就不叫革命，那叫革命意志衰退。
    但是，我们也不能单纯对这种紧张情况叫好，还得作一些具体的考察和分析：是正常的工作时间之内的紧张？还是需要加班加点的紧张？因为紧张劳动的是人，长期地加班加点下去，就会损害人的健康，这在我们今天的社会里是不容许的。怎么办呢？有办法。分析一下造成紧张状况的原因吧！除了干部和职工的政治、思想、业务水平一下子赶不上任务的需要以外，还有一个很重要的原因是：我们的任务变重了，变大了，而劳动组织、工作方法却依然如故。劳动组织和工作方法本来是为了完成任务而采取的某种具体措施，因此，它一定要和任务相适应，才能更多、更快、更好、更省地完成任务。如果任务是先进的，完成任务的方法却是落后的，要依靠落后的工作方法完成先进的任务，必然会形成尖锐的矛盾，目前我们不少机关和企业的情况正是这样。解决这个矛盾，不外两种办法，有的机关和企业单纯要干部和职工加强劳动强度，加班加点。这不是好的作法，而是笨的作法，我们不提倡这种作法。因为这样既不能持久，也不宜持久。而有的机关和企业就不是单纯用紧张的劳动去克服这个矛盾，而是设法改善劳动组织和改进工作方法，使它和新的任务相适应。对外贸易部五金进口公司财会处正是这样作的，他们在大跃进中，合理地调整了人力，改进了工作方法，结果加班加点过分紧张的状况改变了，工作任务同样完成得很好。
    话还得说回来，和一切事物发展的规律一样，工作方法、劳动组织和工作任务相适应的情况也不是永久不变的，就以五金公司财会处为例，过一个时期，当他们的任务更加加重、更加加大的时候，今天已经改变过来的工作方法和劳动组织又会不相适应了，又会出现新的矛盾了，又会要紧张了。解决的办法仍然是不断改进工作方法，不断改善劳动组织，这样，不断产生矛盾，不断解决矛盾，我们的工作就可以不断跃进。
