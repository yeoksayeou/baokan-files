    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: Jiangsu Province is actively building twenty medium and small-sized iron smelting blast furnaces. The volume of these blast furnaces ranges from a minimum of fifteen cubic meters to a maximum of two hundred and fifty cubic meters. They will be put into production in the coming year and the year after, with an annual pig iron production of over 420,000 tons. Among them, Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant has the largest scale, with an annual production of 270,000 tons of pig iron, 100,000 tons of steel, and 80,000 tons of steel products.
    Jiangsu Province has a wide distribution of iron ore resources, large reserves, and a large proportion of rich ore, which is suitable for the development of medium and small-sized iron and steel smelting industries. According to exploration, there are more than a dozen iron ore deposits around Nanjing. These medium and small-sized iron smelting furnaces will be built near the iron ore mines, which can fully utilize these scattered iron ore resources and meet the needs of Jiangsu's industrial and agricultural production leap forward for pig iron.
    The small iron smelting furnace to be built has simple equipment, and Jiangsu Province can basically manufacture it. The construction time is short, fifteen to twenty-eight cubic meter blast furnaces generally only take about three months, and eighty-three cubic meter blast furnaces only take nine months. Small blast furnaces also require less investment, with an average of about 10,000 yuan per cubic meter of equipment.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th: In mid-March, relevant departments in Henan Province held a provincial iron smelting industry conference at the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory in Jiangsu Province. Eighty-eight relevant personnel attending the meeting visited and studied the experience of the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory in preparing and producing an eight-cubic-meter blast furnace, greatly enhancing their confidence in rapidly developing the iron and steel industry in Henan Province, and immediately revised the original plan. They decided to build a large number of blast furnaces and small earthen iron smelting furnaces in forty-nine counties in six special zones, including Xinyang, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Nanyang, Xuchang, and Luoyang, and in the three cities of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jiaozuo this year, striving to smelt 500,000 tons of pig iron this year.
    Henan Province is rich in iron ore resources. According to preliminary investigations, there are iron ore, dolomite, and coking coal raw materials in forty-nine counties throughout the province.

    江苏河南大建炼铁炉
    新华社南京28日电　江苏省正在积极兴办二十座中小型炼铁高炉。这些高炉的容积最小的是十五立方公尺，最大的是二百五十立方公尺。它们将分别在今明两年投入生产，生铁年产量可达四十二万多吨。其中南京钢铁厂规模最大，年产生铁二十七万吨，钢十万吨，钢材八万吨。
    江苏省铁矿资源分布面很广，储量较多，富矿比重较大，适宜于发展中小型钢铁冶炼工业。根据勘探，在南京的周围共有十多处铁矿。这些中小型炼铁炉都将兴建在铁矿附近，可以充分利用这部分分散的铁矿资源，满足省内工农业生产大跃进对于生铁的需要。
    准备兴建的小型炼铁炉设备简单，江苏省基本上都可以制造。建设时间短，十五到二十八立方公尺高炉，一般只要三个月左右，八十三立方公尺的高炉也只需九个月。小型高炉投资也较少，每一立方公尺设备平均只需一万元左右。
    据新华社郑州28日电3月中旬，河南省有关部门在江苏省苏州市农业机械厂召开了全省炼铁工业会议。出席会议的八十八名有关人员，参观学习了苏州农业机械厂八立方公尺高炉的筹建和生产的经验，对于迅速发展河南省钢铁工业的信心大大增强，立即修订了原来的计划。他们决定今年在信阳、开封、新乡、南阳、许昌、洛阳等六个专区四十九个县和郑州、开封、焦作三市大量建设高炉和小型土炼铁炉，争取今年炼出生铁五十万吨。
    河南省的铁矿资源很丰富，据初步调查，全省有四十九个县有铁矿石、白云石、焦煤等原料。
