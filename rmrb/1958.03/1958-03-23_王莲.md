    Victoria Water Lily

    Among the lotus flowers we commonly see are the lotus (Hehua) and the water lily (also called Shui Fu Lian or Zi Wu Lian). Besides these, there is an even larger and more beautiful lotus flower—the Victoria water lily.

    The Victoria water lily is a perennial herbaceous aquatic plant, and its leaves and flowers are much larger than the two types of lotus flowers we usually see. Its leaves float on the water's surface, and before they unfurl, they are rolled into a long, spherical shape, covered with many thorns, resembling a hedgehog. Once unfolded, the round leaf has a diameter of six feet, and the edge of the leaf curls upwards, about two or three inches high, resembling a large, flat sieve floating on the water's surface. The back of the leaf is purple-red and thorny, with a thick petiole in the middle connecting to the root. The surface of the leaf is bright green and, like lotus leaves, has a waxy layer, making it very smooth. Whenever water droplets fall on the leaf surface, they always form small beads that roll around on the leaf surface as the wind blows. Such a large leaf floating on the water surface has a great buoyancy, like a small boat, and even if a six- or seven-year-old child sits on it, it will not sink. The flowers of the Victoria water lily are especially large, with a diameter of one foot to one foot two or three inches. They usually open around 4 p.m., initially white, gradually turning peach-red, then dark red the next morning, closing around 9 a.m., opening again around 4 p.m., and finally withering away the third morning. When the flowers bloom, they emit a very strong fragrance, making them particularly appealing. The seeds are similar in shape and size to peas, with a black outer skin. It can be propagated by root division or sowing.

    The Victoria water lily originates from the tropical Amazon River basin in South America and is most afraid of cold weather. To cultivate it in our country, we must build a very spacious and warm indoor pool, and the indoor temperature must be maintained between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius in winter. The Beijing Botanical Garden is currently preparing to cultivate it.

    The Victoria water lily is a very rare and interesting ornamental plant. Planting it in a large greenhouse in a park, with its fragrant and pleasant flowers blooming in the early mornings and evenings of summer, is most captivating. If we let several five- or six-year-old children sit on several leaves respectively, drifting around, it would bring even greater interest to the visitors. How happy the children playing in this beautiful environment would be! (Image attached)

    莲花，我们常见的有荷花和睡莲（也叫水浮莲或子午莲）两种，此外，还有一种更大更美丽的莲花——王莲。
    王莲是一种多年生草本的水生植物，它的叶子和花，都比我们常看到的那两种莲花要大得多。它的叶子浮在水面上，在还没有展开的时候，卷成一个长形的球状，上面长着很多刺，好像一只刺猬；展开后，圆圆的一片叶子直径有六尺大，叶子的边缘向上卷起，高约二、三寸，很像一只平底的大筛子浮在水面上。叶子的背面紫红色，有刺，正中间有一根很粗的叶柄通向根部。叶子的表面鲜绿，也像荷叶一样生有一层蜡质，非常光滑。每当水点落在叶面上，总是结成一个个的小水珠，随着风的吹动在叶面上滚来滚去。这么大的一片叶子浮在水面上，像一只小船似的有很大的负重力，如果一个六、七岁的小孩坐在它上面，也不会沉下去。王莲的花开得特别大，一朵花的直径有一尺到一尺二、三寸长。一般在午后四时前后开放，初开为白色，渐渐变成桃红色，第二天早上变成深红色，到九时前后合闭，下午四时前后又开放，第三天早上才谢掉。当花开的时候，散出非常浓烈的香气，特别引人喜爱。种子的形状和大小，很像豌豆，外皮黑色。用分根或播种的方法繁殖都可以。
    王莲的故乡是南美洲热带的亚马孙河流域，它最害怕寒冷。在我们国家栽培，就必须给它修建一座非常宽阔温暖的室内水池，冬天室内温度也要保持在摄氏二十五度到三十度之间。现在北京植物园正准备培植。
    王莲是一种非常珍奇而又有趣味的观赏植物，把它种在公园的大型温室里，每当夏天的清早和傍晚，开出芳香宜人的花朵来，最能引人入胜。如果再让几个五、六岁的小孩，分别坐在几片叶子上，游游荡荡，那更会给游人们带来更大的兴趣。在这种美好的环境中嬉戏的小孩子，又该是多么幸福啊！（附图片）
