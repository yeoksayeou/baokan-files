    Great Labor Revolution: Eliminate Shoulder Carrying
    Improvement of Transportation Tool Movement Fully Unfolded in Hubei Province
    Many Agricultural Cooperatives Achieve "Cart-ization," Greatly Improving Labor Efficiency

    (Our report) Under the resounding slogan of "Great Labor Revolution, Eliminate Shoulder Carrying," Hubei Province is carrying out a magnificent tool improvement movement. By early February, one-third of the agricultural cooperatives in the Yichang, Jingzhou, and Xiangyang special districts, as well as Guanghua, Zaoyang, Macheng, and other counties, had achieved "cart-ization."

    The tool improvement movement began in Paoma Township, Dangyang County. During the winter water conservancy construction last year, Paoma Township launched a mass-based tool reform movement. The entire township achieved "cart-ization" in two or three days, eliminating the phenomenon of people carrying soil, and work efficiency generally increased by three to four times or more, fundamentally solving the problem of labor shortages.

    After discovering this new initiative of tool reform in Paoma Township, the Dangyang County Party Committee immediately organized cadres from various townships in the county to visit, summarized the experience of Paoma Township at on-site meetings, and promoted it throughout the county. In less than four or five days, the county basically achieved "cart-ization." In this tool reform movement, 13,195 people in the county contributed 13,817 suggestions; 8,058 people contributed 15,192 pieces of materials; and 25,742 people participated in the manufacture of tools. The movement saw new developments at any time, creating many new and better tools. The Dangyang County Party Committee also promptly mobilized farm tool factories and handicrafts industries, organized them to actively help farmers technically improve their existing tools, and directed the tool reform movement from water conservancy projects to transportation, production, and other aspects. Now, there are eleven types of improved tools in the county, with even more variations in each type. It is truly a riot of color, with a hundred flowers blooming.

    The Hubei Provincial Party Committee attached great importance to this experience in Dangyang County. Comrade Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, visited on December 23 last year and organized neighboring counties to visit and learn. Afterwards, the Provincial Party Committee summarized this experience and decided to promote it throughout the province.

    劳动大革命　消灭肩膀挑
    改良运输工具运动在湖北省全面展开
    很多农业社实现“车子化”，劳动效率大大提高
    本报讯　湖北省在“劳动大革命，消灭肩膀挑”的响亮的口号下，正在开展一个波澜壮阔的改良工具运动。到2月初，宜昌、荆州、襄阳三个专区三分之一的农业社和光化、枣阳、麻城等县，已经实现了“车子化”。
    改良工具的运动，是从当阳县跑马乡开始的。跑马乡在去年冬天兴修水利中，开展了一个群众性的工具改革运动。全乡在两、三天之间就实现了“车子化”，消灭了人挑土的现象，工效普遍提高了三、四倍以上。从根本上解决了劳动力不足问题。
    当阳县委发现了跑马乡改革工具的这一个新的创举之后，立即组织全县各个乡的干部去参观，在现场会议上总结了跑马乡的经验，并在全县推广。不到四、五天，全县就基本上实现“车子化”了。在这次改革工具运动中，全县有一万三千一百九十五人献计一万三千八百一十七条；有八千零五十八人献料一万五千一百九十二件；有二万五千七百四十二人参加制造工具。运动随时都有新发展，创造了不少的新的更好的工具。当阳县委还适时地把农具厂、手工业发动起来，组织他们主动地从技术上去帮助农民把现有的工具加以改进和提高，并把工具改革运动从水利工程方面引向了运输、生产等方面。现在，全县的改良工具已有十一种，每一种类的样子就更多。真是万紫千红，百花齐放。
    湖北省委十分重视当阳县这个经验。省委书记张平化同志曾在去年12月23日前往参观，并组织邻近各县前往参观学习，以后，省委又总结了这一经验，决定在全省范围内推广。
