(Reported from Lanzhou) The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the new situation in the province's water conservancy construction, recently used a bold revolutionary spirit to increase the originally planned expansion of irrigated area from 2.93 million mu to 10 million mu. This figure exceeds the area of water-irrigated land built in the thousands of years before liberation by nearly one time, and is more than 4.4 million mu more than the total amount of newly built water-irrigated land after liberation before 1957.

The high tide of water conservancy construction in Gansu Province arrived last winter. The number of laborers mobilized throughout the province reached 3.4 million, accounting for 64% of the province's total. Two hundred million workdays have been used. The masses plan to raise 110 million yuan, which, based on the province's 12 million population, averages nine yuan per person. The amount of funds raised is equal to five and a half times the state's planned investment in water conservancy for the province this year. The speed of water conservancy construction is progressing rapidly. According to plans reported from various regions, 12.57 million mu of water-irrigated land can be built this year. Recent statistics show that more than 5 million mu have been completed, taking less than four months. This achievement far exceeds the total amount of newly built water conservancy achievements during the water conservancy great leap forward in 1956.

The magnificent water conservancy movement has broken through and swept away all outdated conventions and right-leaning conservative ideas. In the past, it was said that water was difficult to get up the mountain. Now, water is going up the mountain! In the Tianshui Special District alone, there are 38 canals that bring water up the mountain and irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. There are more than 50 in the Pingliang Special District, and more than 10 each in the Dingxi and Linxia Special Districts. There are more than 8,300 canals under construction in the province, many of which bring water up the mountains; many canals are on mountains more than 2,000 meters above sea level. In the past, many people believed that Gansu had many mountains, drought, little water, sparse population, and heavy tasks, and that water conservancy could not develop too quickly. Now, all special districts have greatly accelerated the pace of water conservancy construction. In the past, large-scale projects were handled by the state, and small and medium-sized projects were handled by the masses. People did not believe that the masses could handle large-scale projects. Now, the facts prove that the masses can also handle large-scale projects. For example, the Beiliang Canal built by Gangu and Wushan counties can irrigate more than 300,000 mu of land, and the Donggan Canal built by Yongdeng County irrigates 300,000 mu of land after completion. As for canals that can irrigate more than 100,000 mu of land, each special district has them. When the masses build these canals, they not only do not need money from the state, but they do not even need strong technical support. The main technical force guiding water conservancy is the tens of thousands of peasant water conservancy technicians who have been trained in the province in recent years. In the past, when various conditions for water conservancy construction were not fully available, people were often afraid of rash advances, lacked revolutionary drive, and neglected subjective initiative. Now, they dare to imagine boldly, and they dare to take action to create conditions to turn imagination into reality, and fully develop subjective initiative. Recently, the Taohe Grand Canal project, which the Dingxi Special District is preparing to start construction in July with the assistance of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau to survey, is a typical example. This canal line will start from Liuerlin in Huichuan County, run on mountains 2,000 meters above sea level, be 1,000 kilometers long, and irrigate 5 million to 7 million mu of land in 21 counties and cities. The realization of this plan can fundamentally change the drought situation in the central region. This canal will also be completed by relying on the strength of the masses, which was unimaginable in the past.

Now, Gansu Province has put forward a plan to achieve water conservancy in three years of hard work. Gansu currently has 59 million mu of cultivated land. By 1959, water-irrigated land will reach 37.23 million mu, accounting for more than 60% of the total cultivated area. Each agricultural population will have an average of more than 3.3 mu of water-irrigated land, and will eliminate the threat of drought.

### 甘肃省扫荡陈规陋习和右倾思想  向大自然夺取粮食  以气吞山河的英雄气概创造了兴修水利的奇迹

    甘肃省扫荡陈规陋习和右倾思想
    向大自然夺取粮食
    以气吞山河的英雄气概创造了兴修水利的奇迹
    本报兰州讯　中共甘肃省委最近根据全省水利建设的新形势，用大胆的革命精神，把原订扩大灌溉面积二百九十三万亩的水利建设计划提高到一千万亩。这个数字，超过解放前数千年所修水地近一倍，比解放以后1957年以前新修水地的总数多四百余万亩。
    甘肃省的水利建设高潮，是去年冬天到来的。全省出动的劳动力达三百四十万个，占全省的64％。已用工作日两亿个。群众计划集资一亿一千万元，按照全省一千二百万人口计算，平均每人九元。集资的数字，等于今年国家计划全省水利投资的五倍半。水利建设的速度一日千里。根据各地报上来的计划，今年可修水地一千二百五十七万亩，最近统计已完成五百多万亩，所用去的时间不到四个月。这个成绩远远超过1956年水利大跃进时新修水利成绩的总和。
    波澜壮阔的水利运动，突破和扫荡了一切陈规陋习、右倾保守思想。过去说水难以上山，现在，水上山了！仅是天水专区引水上山、浇灌一万亩土地以上的渠道就有三十八条，平凉专区有五十多条，定西和临夏专区各有十多条。全省正动工修建的渠道计八千三百多条，其中有许多是引水上山的；有不少渠道在拔海二千多公尺的山上。过去，不少人认为甘肃山多、天旱、水源少、人口稀、任务重，以为水利事业不可能发展的太快。现在，各专区都大大加快了水利建设的脚步。过去，一向是大型工程由国家办，中小型工程由群众办，不相信群众可以举办大型工程。现在事实证明群众也可以办大型工程。如甘谷、武山两县修的北梁渠，可浇灌土地三十多万亩，永登县修好东干渠后，灌溉土地三十万亩。至于能浇地十余万亩的渠道，各专区都有。群众在修这些渠道的时候，不但不要国家出钱，甚至不需要技术上的大力支援。指导修水利的主要技术力量，是全省几年来培养出的十几万名农民水利技术员。过去，当兴修水利的各种条件不完全具备时，人们常常是怕冒进，缺乏革命的干劲，忽视主观的能动性。现在，敢于大胆想像了，也敢于动手创造条件把想像变成现实，充分发挥主观能动性了。最近，由省水利局派人协助定西专区踏勘准备争取于7月份动工的洮河大渠工程，就是一个典型。这条渠线将从会川县柳儿林起，走行在拔海二千公尺的山上，全长一千公里，浇灌二十一县市的五百至七百万亩土地。实现这个计划，便可以从根本上改变中部地区的干旱面貌。这条渠，也将依靠群众力量完成，这是过去不敢想像的事。
    现在，甘肃省已提出了苦战三年实现水利化的计划。甘肃现有耕地五千九百万亩，至1959年水地将达三千七百二十三万亩，占总耕地面积60％以上，每一农业人口平均有水地三亩三分多，并将消灭旱灾的威胁。
