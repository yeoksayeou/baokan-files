Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 10th - Liu Jianxun, First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a speech on March 8th at the First Session of the First People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, entitled "Strengthen the Close Unity of All Ethnic Groups in Guangxi and Strive to Accelerate Socialist Construction."

Liu Jianxun first extended congratulations on behalf of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Then, after recalling the glorious revolutionary traditions of the various ethnic groups in Guangxi and the victories achieved in socialist revolution and socialist construction since liberation, he said: The various ethnic groups in Guangxi have clearly realized through their personal experience in long-term revolutionary struggles that all these victories have been achieved primarily because of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Precisely because of this, people regard supporting or opposing the leadership of the Party as the dividing line between revolutionaries and reactionaries in all matters, and resolutely struggle against those who oppose the leadership of the Party without any leniency. Now, we are engaged in socialist construction, which is a great undertaking unprecedented in history. Only by further strengthening the leadership of the Party can we guarantee the victory of this great undertaking.

Liu Jianxun said: The various ethnic groups in Guangxi also clearly realize that all these victories have been achieved as a result of the close unity and joint efforts of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, we resolutely oppose national oppression and discrimination, implement a policy of national equality, and make every effort to safeguard and develop the great unity of all ethnic groups. National unity versus national division is a major issue of right and wrong. On this issue, right-wing elements once spread a lot of poison and carried out a lot of destructive activities. Their purpose was to break through a gap on the national issue in order to realize their ambition of restoring capitalism. The various reactionary remarks and actions of the right-wing elements must be and have been severely criticized and attacked. At the same time, the ideology of Han chauvinism and local nationalism must also be thoroughly criticized. In the past, we focused on criticizing Han chauvinism, which was correct, and we should continue to criticize it in the future; however, in the recent period, local nationalist ideas have grown, so in the current rectification movement, we should focus on criticizing local nationalist ideas. He said: The unification of our motherland's big family is realized on the basis of national equality, and national regional autonomy is implemented within the motherland's big family. Only by continuously consolidating the unity and unification of the motherland's big family can we guarantee that the partial interests and current interests of all ethnic groups are combined with the common interests and long-term interests among all ethnic groups; at the same time, only by respecting and guaranteeing the autonomous rights of ethnic autonomous regions and taking care of the special interests and needs of all ethnic groups can we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in building socialism.

    广西省委书记刘建勋在自治区人代会上
    号召各族人民加强团结
    据新华社南宁10日电  中共广西省委第一书记刘建勋，8日在广西僮族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上作了题为“加强广西各族人民的亲密团结，为加速社会主义建设而奋斗”的发言。
    刘建勋首先代表中共广西省委对广西僮族自治区的成立表示祝贺。接着，他在追述广西各族人民光荣的革命传统，和解放后在社会主义革命及社会主义建设中所获得的胜利之后说：广西各族人民在长期革命斗争的切身经验中，清楚地认识到这一切胜利的取得，首先是由于有了中国共产党的领导。正是因为这样，人们把拥护还是反对党的领导，作为在一切问题上划分革命派和反动派的界线，毫不留情地去和那些反对党的领导的人进行坚决的斗争。现在，我们正在从事着社会主义建设，这是史无前例的伟大事业，只有进一步加强党的领导，才能保证这一伟大事业的胜利。
    刘建勋说：广西各族人民也清楚地认识到，这一切胜利的取得，是在党的领导下各族人民亲密团结、共同努力的结果。因此，我们坚决反对民族压迫和歧视，实行民族平等的政策，尽一切努力来维护和发展各族人民的大团结。民族团结还是民族分裂，这是一个大是大非的问题。在这个问题上，右派分子就曾经散布了许多毒素，进行了许多破坏活动。他们的目的是要在民族问题上突破一个缺口，以实现其复辟资本主义的野心。对右派分子的各种反动言行，必须并且已经给予严厉的批判和打击。与此同时，对大汉族主义和地方民族主义思想，也必须加以彻底的批判。过去，我们曾经着重批判了大汉族主义思想，这是对的，今后还应该继续加以批判；但是，在最近一个时期，地方民族主义思想有所滋长，因此在当前的整风运动中，应该着重批判地方民族主义思想。他说：我们祖国大家庭的统一是在民族平等的基础上实现的，而民族区域自治又是在祖国大家庭内实行的。只有不断地巩固祖国大家庭的团结和统一，才能保证各民族的局部利益、当前利益同各民族之间的共同利益、长远利益结合起来；同时，也只有尊重和保障各民族自治地方的自治权利，照顾了各民族的特殊利益和要求，才能充分发挥各民族人民建设社会主义的积极性。
