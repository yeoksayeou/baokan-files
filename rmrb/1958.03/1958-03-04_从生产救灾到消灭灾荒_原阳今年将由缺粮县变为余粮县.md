Special Dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The 300,000+ people of Yuanyang County, Henan Province, have launched a major campaign against saline-alkali wasteland. After more than two months of effort, 57.3% of the earthwork plan has been completed. This year, the county plans to cultivate 300,000 mu of paddy fields and 150,000 mu of dry rice fields on 650,000 mu of saline-alkali and low-lying, flood-prone land, transforming the historically grain-deficient county into a grain-surplus county.

Yuanyang County is located in the old course of the Yellow River and suffers from disasters every year. Disaster relief is the central task of the area every year. After liberation, the government provided a total of more than 16 million yuan in assistance to the local people through various means. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state supplied more than 63 million jin of grain to the county, after offsetting all purchases and sales. Last year, the disaster was more severe, with an average yield of only 126 jin per mu. Some cadres working here felt that disaster relief was endless, difficulties were heavy, and they lacked confidence in achieving the per-mu yield required by the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. However, the ten-mu experimental paddy field cultivated in Huangzhuang Village, known for its severely saline-alkali soil, achieved an average yield of 450 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 904 jin. This fact greatly encouraged local cadres and farmers. Later, the county party secretary led a group of cadres to the Tianjin Special Zone in Hebei to visit and learn from their experience in transforming low-lying and alkaline land, and all the cadres raised their heads in the face of difficulties.

At mobilization meetings of more than 100,000 people held in various areas of the county, the county party committee put forward the battle cry: "Grit your teeth, fight hard for three years, boost your energy, and turn saline-alkali wasteland into a little Jiangnan." The people of the county enthusiastically responded to this call.

Yuanyang County has also implemented the policy of relying on the masses to run water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily. The county's water conservancy construction plan for this year requires more than 3.7 million yuan. In addition to the state's investment of 920,000 yuan in large-scale projects, the rest must be solved by the county itself. According to statistics from mid-January, the people of the county invested a total of more than 890,000 yuan (including materials converted into cash), accounting for more than 31% of the investment. The construction of more than 1,000 large and small water conservancy buildings requires a large number of stones, lime, bricks, and gravel. However, there are no mountains within a hundred li of Yuanyang County. Just the required stones alone would require each of the county's 484 agricultural cooperatives to send a truck, which would take 40 days. To solve this problem, the cadres in Dongzhuang Agricultural Cooperative conducted a survey of waste materials. Nearly 200 households in this cooperative had more than ten kinds of broken stone mills, broken stone rollers, broken mortars, and broken stone tablets, totaling 19 cubic meters, as well as 66 trucks of broken bricks and tiles. If all the waste materials in the county are collected, it is estimated that at least 3,000 cubic meters of stones and more than 1,000 cubic meters of broken bricks and tiles can be collected. Bluestone can be used to burn lime, which can solve the material difficulties and save money. Therefore, the government used the state's investment of 920,000 yuan in water conservancy projects to pre-order materials from disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives, solving the contradiction between water conservancy investment and disaster relief funds.

According to statistics from mid-January, in addition to completing more than half of this year's water conservancy project earthwork, which can irrigate 280,000 mu, Yuanyang County has accumulated more than 1.6 million carts of fertilizer, top-dressed 260,000 mu of wheat, completed 70% of the winter plowing plan, overfulfilled the winter tree planting plan, the county's sideline production has generated 810,000 yuan in income, and the rectification campaign has also achieved good results.

    从生产救灾到消灭灾荒
    原阳今年将由缺粮县变为余粮县
    本报特约新华社郑州专讯  河南原阳县的三十多万人民向盐碱洼地展开了大进军。经过两个多月的努力，已经完成土方计划57.3％。这个县今年计划将在全县六十五万亩盐碱地和低洼易涝地中，开出三十万亩水稻田和十五万亩旱稻田，从而使历史上的缺粮县一跃成为余粮县。
    原阳县地处黄河故道，年年受灾。救灾是当地每年的中心工作。解放后，政府通过各种方式给当地人民的帮助共达一千六百多万元。在第一个五年计划期间，国家在这个县征购和销售粮食全部相抵外，多供应了六千三百多万斤粮食。去年灾情较重，全县平均每亩产量只有一百二十六斤。在这里工作的一部分干部，觉得救灾无头，困难重重，对达到农业发展纲要修正草案要求的亩产量，信心不足。但是盐碱奇重的荒庄村培植的十亩水稻试验田，平均亩产四百五十斤，最高的达到九百零四斤。这一事实给当地干部和农民鼓舞极大。后来，县委书记又带领一批干部到河北天津专区参观学习改造低洼地和碱地的经验，全体干部在困难面前抬起了头。
    县委在全县分片召开的十多万人动员大会上，提出了“咬紧牙关，苦战三年，鼓起干劲，把盐碱洼地变成小江南”的战斗口号。全县人民热烈响应了这一号召。
    原阳县还执行了依靠群众勤俭办水利的方针。全县今年水利建设计划需要用费三百七十万多元，除国家对大型工程投资九十二万元外，其余都要自行解决。到元月中旬的统计，全县人民共投资（包括物料折款）八十九万多元，占投资的31％多。在兴修一千多座大小水利建筑物中，需要大批的石头、石灰、砖头和碎石。但是原阳县百里之内没有山，仅所需要的石头，全县四百八十四个农业社各出一辆车拉，为期也要四十天。为解决这个问题，县里干部在董庄农业社作了废物废料调查，这个社近二百户人家中，有破石磨、破石碾、破对臼和破石碑等十多种，共有十九立方，还有破砖和碎瓦片六十六车。如果把全县的这些废物全部收集起来，估计最少可搜集石头三千多立方，碎砖瓦片一千多立方。青石用来烧石灰，可解决物料困难，又省了钱。于是，政府把国家兴办水利工程的九十二万元投资，用于向受灾农业社预订物料，解决了水利投资和救灾用钱的矛盾。
    截至元月中旬的统计，原阳县除今年的水利工程土方已作了一半多，可浇地二十八万亩外，全县积肥一百六十多万车，小麦追肥二十六万亩，冬耕计划完成了70％，冬季植树计划超额完成，全县的副业生产已收入八十一万元，整社运动也取得了良好的效果。
