    We Need Lamp Shades
    Since last autumn, several counties in the Dali Special District of Yunnan have been unable to buy kerosene lamp glass shades. The farmers have had to spend more money on candles or lamps without shades. We conducted several experiments and found that a kerosene lamp with a shade, used for about three hours every night, consumes an average of two and a half jin of kerosene per month. With kerosene priced at 7 jiao and 2 fen per jin, the monthly cost for lamp oil is only 1.80 yuan. Using candles, an average of 22 small candles are used each month, costing 1 jiao and 2 fen each, resulting in a monthly cost of 2.64 yuan. Using a kerosene lamp without a shade consumes about half a jin more kerosene per month than a lamp with a shade, and the light is dimmer. The kerosene fumes are irritating, affecting people's health.
    The farmers here urgently request that the departments producing and distributing kerosene lamp glass shades quickly supply them with lamp shades.

    我们需要灯罩
    从去年秋天以来，我们云南大理专区好几个县都买不到煤油灯玻璃罩。农民们只好多花钱点蜡烛或无罩灯。我们试验了几次，每天晚上点三个钟头左右的有罩煤油灯，平均每月用二斤半煤油，每斤油价是七角二分，每月灯油费仅需一元八角。点蜡烛平均每月用小蜡烛二十二支，每支一角二分，每月得二元六角四分。点无罩煤油灯比有罩灯每月多耗费煤油半斤左右，而且灯光不亮，煤油气熏人，影响人们的身体健康。
    这里的农民迫切要求生产和经营煤油灯玻璃罩的部门赶快给他们供应煤油灯罩。
