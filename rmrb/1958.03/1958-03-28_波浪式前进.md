Wavelike Advance
Wu Lü

Someone tried to "predict the fate" of the Great Leap Forward, concluding that its "fate" was very bitter: "Doubts exist whether the Great Leap Forward on various fronts is just a passing fad that will soon vanish" (see reader Lin Bo's letter in "China Youth" No. 5). How was this "self-denying fate" of "soon vanishing" calculated? It is said to be based on the "law" that "some of our work progresses like twisting the Yangko dance, one moment opposing conservatism and the next opposing rash advance."

I don't want to talk too much about these things. Many people have already discussed that the Great Leap Forward is not a rash advance and will not oppose rash advance in the future. However, Lin Bo's "fate prediction" for the Great Leap Forward has aroused my interest, and I would also like to look forward to the prospects of the Great Leap Forward. In my opinion, the prospect of the Great Leap Forward is a wavelike advance.

Is this "fate" of wavelike advance good or bad? It is very good, it can be said to be a "top-notch lottery." If you ask how this "fate" was calculated? The reasoning is also very simple. Everything develops in contradiction. Where there is a spear, there is a shield; where there is life, there is death; where there is war, there is peace; where there is a meeting, there is a dismissal; where there is "forward march," there is "halt." The Great Leap Forward is no exception. What is the Great Leap Forward? To use a perhaps not very appropriate analogy, ten steps, walking up one step at a time, is ordinary progress; taking two steps at a time, from one to three, to five, to seven, this is the Great Leap Forward. But even though it is a Great Leap Forward, what is it called when you step on the third level and are about to step towards the fifth level but haven't yet? Undoubtedly, it is called a stop; even if it is only for a split second, it is called a stop. Leap followed by stop, and then leap again, this is wavelike advance, which is the unity of opposites.

Please see, isn't the Great Leap Forward in life like this? The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's successful experiment with double-tap hole steelmaking is a leap in the steel industry, but when the experiment is successful, it is both the moment of leaping up and the moment of stopping. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's successful experiment with triple-tap hole steelmaking is another leap in the steel industry, but when the experiment is successful, it is also the moment of leaping up and the moment of stopping. Will there be more leaps in the future? Yes, for example, using converter steelmaking instead of open-hearth steelmaking, isn't this a wavelike advance?

Perhaps, to some people, the five words "wavelike advance" do not sound as pleasing as "straight advance" or "linear ascent." However, "fate is sealed," whether you like it or not, it must be a wavelike advance, so what can you do? Moreover, all "straight advance" and "linear ascent" things in the world are actually all wavelike advances and spiral ascents from a dialectical point of view.

Comrades with this kind of worry are probably also well-intentioned. They are afraid that the words wavelike advance will easily make people think of ups and downs, "up" is the Great Leap Forward, then "down" becomes a retreat? In fact, this is also not understanding dialectics. Up and down are precisely the two opposite components that make up a wave. With up and down, there are waves. Who has ever seen a wave that only goes up or only goes down? I guarantee that no one has ever seen it. But even though waves have ups and downs, they are always rolling forward, never staying in the same place, let alone retreating. The Great Leap Forward on various fronts is also like this. Double-tap hole steelmaking is a wave, triple-tap hole steelmaking is another wave, and future converter steelmaking will also be a wave. This wave rises and falls, but this fall is not that fall, each time it falls at a higher level, and the steel industry thus gallops and leaps forward.

"Fate prediction" and so on are just jokes. But grasping the law of motion and development to guide the advance of motion is an important leadership method. Since the Great Leap Forward is a wavelike advance, then we should tighten up when we should tighten up, and loosen up when we should loosen up; we should hurry up with urgent matters, and we can also slow down with things that can be delayed; when we need to organize a million-strong army to go into battle overnight, we should advance with a wave, and when we need to rest, we should also move the troops back to the barracks and sit down. It is not feasible to only tighten up and not loosen up, only hurry up and not slow down, only fight and not rest. People who have fought know that even the strongest steel army, fighting every day, may not win every battle beautifully, but a rest will definitely win a beautiful battle.

    波浪式前进
    吴滤
    有人给跃进“算命”，结论是“命”苦得很：“怀疑各个战线上搞跃进是否又是一阵子风，不久之后就会烟消云散”（见“中国青年”第五期读者林波的来信）。这“不久之后就会烟消云散”的“克己命”是怎样算出来的呢？据说是根据“我们有些工作就像扭秧歌似的前进，一阵子反保守，又一阵子反冒进”的“规律”算出来的。
    关于这些，我不想多谈。跃进不是冒进，将来也不会反冒进，这些已有许多人谈过了。倒是林波给跃进“算命”的事，引起我的一点兴趣，也想来展望一下跃进的前景。依我看来，跃进的前景是波浪式前进。
    波浪式前进，这“命”好不好呢？好得很，可说是“上上签”。若问这“命”是怎样算出来的？道理也很简单。一切事物都是在矛盾中发展的。有矛必有盾，有生必有死，有战争必有和平，有开会必有散会，有“开步走”必有“立停”。跃进也不例外。什么叫跃进？打个也许是不十分恰当的比方，十步台阶，一步一步走上去，这是普通的前进；两步并着一步走，由一而三、而五、而七，这就是跃进。但跃进尽管跃进，当跨到第三级正举步向第五级迈去而还没有迈的时候，这算什么呢？毫无疑问，这叫做停；那怕只一刹那的功夫，也叫做停。跃后必停，停后再跃，这就是波浪式前进，也就是对立面的统一。
    请看，生活里的跃进不正是这样的吗？重庆钢铁公司试验双槽出钢成功，这是钢铁工业的一跃，但试验成功的时候，是跃上来的时候也是停下来的时候。太原钢铁厂试验三槽出钢成功，这又是钢铁工业的一跃，但试验成功的时候，同样也是跃上来的时候又是停下来的时候。将来还跃不跃呢？还跃，例如用转炉炼钢代替平炉炼钢等，这不是波浪式前进吗？
    也许，在有些人听来，这“波浪式前进”五个字，总不似“笔直前进”、“直线上升”等等来得入耳。然而，“命中注定”，不管你愿意不愿意，它一定是波浪式前进的，又有什么办法呢？而且，世上一切“笔直前进”、“直线上升”的事情，用辩证法看来，实际上也无一不是波浪式前进、螺旋式上升的。
    有这种忧虑的同志，大概也是好心。他们唯恐波浪式前进的字眼容易使人想到一起一伏，“起”是跃进，那“伏”不成了后退吗？其实，这也是不懂得辩证法。起和伏正是组成波浪的两个对立成份。有起有伏，才有波浪。谁曾见过只起不伏或只伏不起的波浪？担保谁也没有见过。但波浪尽管有起有伏，总是滚滚向前的，它从不停留在原来的地方，更不后退。各个战线上的跃进也是这样。双槽出钢是一个波浪，三槽出钢又是一个波浪，将来转炉炼钢也是一个波浪。这波浪一起一伏，但此伏非彼伏，一回总比一回伏在更高的水平上，钢铁工业就这样奔腾跃进了。
    “算命”云云，不过是笑谈。但掌握运动的发展规律来指导运动前进，却是一个重要的领导方法。跃进既然是波浪式前进，那么，该紧的时候就要紧一紧，该松的时候也要松一松；该急的事情应该快一点，可缓的事情也可以慢一慢；需要组织百万大军连夜上阵的时候，应该挥戈前进，需要休整的时候，也应该把队伍开到营房里坐下来。只紧不松，只急不缓，只打仗不休整，是行不通的。打过仗的人都知道，再强的钢铁劲旅，天天打仗，未必仗仗都漂亮，休整一次却一定打一个漂亮仗。
