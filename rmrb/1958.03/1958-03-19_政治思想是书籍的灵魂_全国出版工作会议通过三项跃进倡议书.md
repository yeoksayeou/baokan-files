Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 15th. The National Publishing Work Leap Forward Conference concluded in Shanghai today.

More than 150 representatives from various regions, after six days of extensive airing of views, debates, and discussions, clarified the goals, principles, and tasks of the great leap forward in publishing work, exchanged advanced experiences, and adopted three leap forward initiatives.

The three initiatives unanimously proposed that, in coordination with the great leap forward in all fields, the quantity of books should be appropriately increased, and the quality of books should be greatly improved. Publishing houses focusing on politics, culture and education, and finance and economics guarantee that more than half of the new book titles will have reprinting value; science and technology publishing houses proposed to be oriented towards production, grasp key points, and continuously reflect new achievements in scientific research and spread new technological achievements; local publishing houses requested that popular readings account for more than 70% of the total number of publications. The initiatives also put forward specific requirements and measures for opening up publishing houses, strengthening the publishing workforce to be both red and expert, a great leap forward in thinking, running publishing houses diligently and thriftily, and strengthening book reviews.

Vice Minister of Culture Chen Kehan made a concluding speech today. He said: The purpose and guiding principle of the great leap forward in publishing work is to strengthen socialist and patriotic education, promote and develop science and culture, serve the opposition to domestic and foreign enemies, "eliminate capitalism and promote socialism," build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and promote the development of social productive forces. Our publishing work is part of the superstructure, and it must serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve socialism, serve the country's economic construction and cultural and educational construction, and directly and indirectly play an active role in the development of productive forces. Therefore, we must connect with the masses and connect with reality. We must never publish for the sake of publishing, or leap forward for the sake of leaping forward. Our work should focus on the word "service." If we serve well, we will achieve great results and play a promoting role. Different types of publishing houses should formulate their own work guidelines based on the above general purpose and guiding principles, combined with specific circumstances. Generally, local publishing houses in provinces should focus on factories, especially on rural areas, and take the publication and supply of popular readings for the reading of workers, peasants, and soldiers and grassroots cadres in the province as their main task. They should also organize the writing forces in the province to appropriately publish some intermediate and advanced academic works, but the proportion should not be too large.

Chen Kehan pointed out that the great leap forward in publishing work must implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and, according to the characteristics of publishing work, combine the four elements of more, faster, better, and more economical well. He said: The soul of books is political and ideological content, and the role of books depends on the quality of their content. This is what makes them different from general industrial and agricultural products. Therefore, we must appropriately increase the quantity and greatly improve the quality, and truly publish some good books. Publishing and distribution work must greatly strengthen planning, and according to the content quality of the books, their relationship to the interests of the country and the people, and the urgency of their need, stipulate appropriate publishing and distribution methods and quantities, instead of making a great leap forward in quantity regardless of whether they are good or bad. For the works of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, we should make reasonable arrangements, and we must not emphasize the past over the present, or emphasize foreign countries over China.

Chen Kehan also emphasized: In the great leap forward in publishing work, we should further correctly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Academic works of various schools and literary and artistic works of various styles, as long as they have certain academic value and artistic value, should be given the opportunity to be published. However, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, strictly implement the principle of publishing books in a planned and proportionate manner, and ensure that Marxist-Leninist works, correct scientific and technological works, and socialist realistic literary and artistic works reflecting the lives and struggles of modern workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy a major position. Educational and policy-oriented books should be distinguished from academic books, and we should strive for correctness. We are not allowed to distort and use the slogan of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" to instill bourgeois reactionary ideas and hinder the correct realization of policies.

In addition to elaborating on issues such as running publishing undertakings diligently and thriftily, improving the system, unifying arrangements, and closely coordinating the relationship between publishing, printing, and distribution, Chen Kehan also proposed to greatly strengthen the publishing workforce, eliminate capitalism and promote socialism, be both red and expert, and make a great leap forward in thinking in order to adapt to the needs of continuous revolution.

Finally, he emphasized: We must resolutely obey and rely on the leadership of the Party, place publishing work conscientiously and unreservedly under the supervision and guidance of the Party, and fully follow the mass line in our work. At present, we must learn from Shanghai's experience and vigorously launch the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

The Fourth Branch Store Managers Conference of Xinhua Bookstore also closed today. The conference adopted a leap forward initiative to all staff members of Xinhua Bookstore across the country. Their slogan is: "Distribute more good books, circulate books faster, achieve good quality and results, and save on expenses." They require that the number of books issued this year reach 2 billion copies, an increase of 60% over last year, of which the number of rural issues and the number of science and technology books issued increased by 100% and 80% over last year.

    政治思想是书籍的灵魂
    全国出版工作会议通过三项跃进倡议书
    新华社上海15日电　全国出版工作跃进会议今天在上海闭幕。
    来自各地的一百五十多位代表，经过六天的大鸣大放、大争大辩，明确了出版工作大跃进的目的、方针和任务，交流了先进经验，通过了三项大跃进倡议书。
    三项倡议书一致提出，要配合各方面的大跃进，适当增加书籍数量，大力提高书籍质量。政治、文教、财政经济方面的出版社保证新书品种中一半以上有重版价值；科学技术出版社提出要面向生产、抓住重点、不断反映科学研究的新成果和传播技术上的新成就；地方出版社要求通俗读物占出版总数70％以上。倡议书中还提出了开门办社；加强出版工作队伍，又红又专，思想大跃进；勤俭办社；加强书评等方面的具体要求和措施。
    文化部副部长陈克寒今天作了总结发言。他说：出版工作大跃进的目的和方针，就是要加强社会主义和爱国主义教育，繁荣和发展科学文化，为反对国内外敌人，“灭资兴无”，多快好省地建设社会主义，为促进社会生产力的发展服务。我们的出版工作是上层建筑的一部分，它必须为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务，为国家的经济建设和文教建设服务，直接地间接地对生产力的发展起到积极作用。因此，必须联系群众，联系实际。决不能为出版而出版，为跃进而跃进。我们的工作应着眼于“服务”两个字，服务得好，成绩就大，就起促进作用。各种不同类型的出版社，应当根据上述总的目的和方针，结合具体情况，制定自己的工作方针。一般省的地方出版社应该面向工厂，特别是面向农村，以出版供应本省的工农群众和基层干部阅读的通俗读物为主要任务。也应该组织本省范围的著作力量，适当地出版一些中级和高级的学术著作，但比重不宜太大。
    陈克寒指出出版工作的大跃进，必须贯彻执行多快好省的方针，并且根据出版工作的特点，把多快好省四者很好地结合起来。他说：书籍的灵魂是政治思想内容，书籍的作用取决于它的内容质量，这是它跟一般工农业产品不同的地方。因此，要适当增加数量，大力提高质量，真正出版一些好书。出版发行工作要大大加强计划性，根据书籍的内容质量，对国家和人民的利害关系，需要的迫切程度，分别规定恰当的出版发行办法和数量，而不是不分好坏一律在数量上大跃进。对于中外古今的著作，应该合理安排，不能重古轻今，重外轻中。
    陈克寒还着重指出：出版工作在大跃进中，应该进一步正确地执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策。各种学派的学术著作和各种风格的文艺作品，只要有一定的学术价值和艺术价值，都应该得到出版的机会。但是必须加强党的领导和马列主义思想的指导，严格地执行有计划按比例出版书籍的原则，保证马列主义著作，正确的科学技术著作，反映现代工农兵生活和斗争的社会主义现实主义的文艺作品，占有主要地位。教育性政策性的书籍应该同学术性书籍有所区别，应该力求正确，不允许歪曲和利用“百家争鸣”的口号，灌输资产阶级反动思想，妨碍政策的正确实现。
    陈克寒除了对勤俭办出版事业，改进体制，统一安排，密切出版印刷发行的协作关系等问题作了阐述以外，还提出要大大地加强出版工作队伍，灭资兴无，又红又专，思想上大跃进，以便适应不断革命的要求。
    最后他强调指出：必须坚决服从和依靠党的领导，把出版工作认真地毫无保留地放在党的监督指导之下，并且在工作中充分走群众路线，目前必须学习上海的经验，大张旗鼓开展反浪费、反保守运动。
    新华书店第四次分店经理会议也在今天闭幕。会议通过了向全国新华书店工作人员的大跃进倡议书。他们的口号是：“好书发行多，书籍流通快，质量效果好，费用开支省。”他们要求今年书籍发行数量达到二十亿册，比去年增加60％，其中农村发行量和科学技术书籍发行量比去年增加100％和80％。
