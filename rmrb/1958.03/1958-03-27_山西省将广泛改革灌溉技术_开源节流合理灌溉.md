　　Taiyuan, March 26th. This newspaper reports: Shanxi Province recently held an on-site conference on irrigation management work in Jiexiu County, Jinzhong, to study specific measures to implement the tapping of water conservancy potential and the saving of irrigation water. The conference decided to launch an irrigation technology reform movement to open new sources and reduce expenditure, realizing a great leap forward in irrigation work.
　　The conference organized attendees to visit the Hongshan Irrigation Area in Jiexiu County on-site. This historically old small irrigation area could only irrigate more than 20,000 mu of land in the past. In recent years, due to the expansion of water springs, the volume of water increased, the channels were transformed, the ridges were reduced in size, and rational irrigation was implemented, expanding the irrigated area threefold. The cultivated land in the irrigated area had a significantly higher yield than the cultivated land irrigated by flooding in the past and nearby. The conference also exchanged experiences from the Yudao River Irrigation Area in Fenyang County, which allocates water throughout the four seasons, rotates irrigation day and night, and irrigates 100,000 mu of cultivated land throughout the year with a flow rate of one cubic meter per second. The experiences of many regions prove that strengthening irrigation management, improving irrigation technology, expanding the irrigated area by one to three times, and repairing farmland engineering greatly improves water utilization. Through on-site visits and experience sharing, the attendees clearly recognized the principle of emphasizing both development and management, and specifically recognized that fully leveraging the role of existing engineering equipment is a way to expand the irrigated area quickly, well, and economically.
　　Judging from the materials reflected by the attendees, Shanxi Province has abundant water resources, but the past development and utilization were very limited. Much of the water utilized was lost through seepage in channels and fields. The utilization rate of water wells and mechanical irrigation equipment was very low. Farmers in many regions follow irrational irrigation traditions, especially in the Fen River Irrigation Area in Jinzhong, where farmland engineering is lacking, and large-area flooding irrigation is adopted. Due to excessive irrigation, it is not only uneconomical in terms of water usage and harmful to crop growth, but also raises the groundwater level, destroys the soil structure, and leads to soil salinization. After clarifying the current situation of irrigation management work in various parts of the province, the attendees decided to work hard for several months on the basis of existing irrigation equipment to expand the area of clear water irrigation by 10 million mu.
　　After the attendees identified problems and came up with solutions, they decided to take six major measures to fundamentally change the face of irrigation management work in Shanxi Province.
　　First, vigorously repair and reinforce channels. In addition to requiring new channels to be built according to standards, old channels should be universally repaired. From cadres to the masses, correct the ideas and practices of "wanting water, hoping for water, but not cherishing water" and "valuing labor but not valuing water," remove obstacles in channels, straighten and flatten them, so that channels speed up the flow, do not accumulate silt, and reduce seepage.
　　Second, thoroughly change the backward practice of flooding irrigation. Farmland engineering is required to be level and the ridges to be small. Generally, in clear water irrigation areas, ridges should be reduced to less than one mu. Wide-row crops such as cotton and corn should be ditch irrigated. Implement a system of timed, fixed water volume, and fixed area usage, with each mu using no more than 40 cubic meters of water each time.
　　Third, strengthen and improve irrigation management and mechanical operation technology, and cultivate agricultural cooperative technicians in a planned way to help them learn how to measure flow rate, level ground, calculate the effective utilization rate of channels, calculate irrigation quotas, and master water distribution methods.
　　Fourth, tap groundwater and conserve surface water. Increase water volume and manage it well at the same time, so that there is development when there is a source, and there is conservation when there is flow.
　　Fifth, unify the planning of water usage, adopt cooperative methods to resolve the contradictions between upstream and downstream water usage, and change the past phenomena of having water but no land or having land but no water.
　　Sixth, strengthen the leadership of irrigation work, and improve and establish grassroots management organizations. Each county, township, and agricultural cooperative should establish specialized management organizations. (Attached pictures)

    山西省将广泛改革灌溉技术
    开源节流合理灌溉
    本报太原26日电　山西省最近在晋中介休县召开灌溉管理工作的现场会议，研究具体贯彻挖掘水利潜力、节约灌溉用水的措施。会议决定要掀起一个开源节流的灌溉技术改革运动，实现灌溉工作大跃进。
    会议组织到会人员到介休县洪山灌区进行了现场参观。这个历史悠久的小灌区过去长期只能浇两万多亩地，近几年来由于挖大水泉增加了水量，改造了渠道，划小了畦埝，实行合理灌溉后，使灌溉面积扩大了三倍，灌区耕地比过去和附近大水漫灌的耕地都获得显著增产。会上并交流了汾阳县峪道河灌区一年四季调配用水，日夜轮浇，流量一秒公方的水全年浇到十万亩耕地等经验。许多地区的经验证明，加强灌溉管理工作，改进灌溉技术，使灌溉面积扩大了一倍至三倍，整修田面工程，大大提高了水的利用率。通过实际参观和介绍经验，到会人员明确认识了发展与管理并重的方针，具体认识到充分发挥现有工程设备的作用，是扩大灌溉面积又多又快又好又省的作法。
    从到会人员反映的材料看，山西省各地水利资源很充沛，但过去开发利用的很有限，利用起来的水，在渠道、田间渗漏浪费很多。水井和机械灌溉设备利用率很低。不少地区农民沿袭着不合理的浇地传统，特别是晋中汾河灌区缺乏田面工程，采取大面积大水漫灌的作法，由于浇水过量，不仅用水上不经济，对作物生长有害，同时提高了地下水位，破坏了土壤结构，还形成耕地盐碱化。到会人员澄清全省各地灌溉管理工作现状之后，决定在现有灌溉设备的基础上，苦干几个月，扩大清水灌溉面积一千万亩。
    经过到会人员找问题想办法，决定采取六大措施，从根本上改变山西省灌溉管理工作上的面貌。
    首先是大力整修、加固渠道，除要求新建渠道按标准建设外，对旧渠道要普遍检修。从干部到群众，纠正“想水、盼水、不爱水”和“惜工不惜水”的思想、作法，扫除渠道障碍物、取直垫平，使渠道加快流速，不淤泥、少渗水。
    其次要彻底改变大水漫灌的落后作法，要求田面工程作到地平、畦小，一般清水灌区畦块要划小到一亩以下。棉花、玉米等宽行作物实行沟浇。推行定时、定水、定面积用水制度，每亩每次用水不超过四十公方。
    第三、加强和提高灌溉管理和操作机械技术，有计划地培养农业社技术员，帮助他们学会测流量、测地平；算渠道有效利用率、算灌水定额；掌握配水方法等。
    第四、挖掘地下水、保蓄地面水。增加水量与管好用好双管齐下，作到有源就开，有流就节。
    第五、统一规划用水，采取协作的办法解决上下游用水的矛盾，改变过去有水无地或有地无水的现象。
    第六、加强灌溉工作的领导，健全和建立基层管理组织。各县、乡和农业社都要成立专管组织。（附图片）
