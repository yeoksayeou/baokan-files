    Ovetchkin's Letter
    The Wenhui Daily published a letter from Soviet writer Ovetchkin on its third page on the 19th, titled "Greetings to Chinese Writers Going to the Countryside for Training." Ovetchkin said, "Among all the recent events in Chinese literary circles, the most pleasing to me is the large number of writers going to the countryside to work." Ovetchkin believes this will bring many benefits to Chinese literature. He said that among the Soviet writers he knows, those who have achieved the greatest success in writing are those who have had more practical training. Ovetchkin extends warm respect to all Chinese writers working in the countryside. He quoted a proverb to encourage Chinese writers to go deep among the masses, which is: "To understand a person, you must eat a pood of salt with him."

    奥维奇金的来信
    19日文汇报三版登出了苏联作家奥维奇金的一封信，题目是“向下乡锻炼的中国作家致意”。奥维奇金说：“在最近中国文学界发生的一切事件中，最使我高兴的是：大批作家下乡劳动。”奥维奇金认为这将给中国文学带来许多好处。他说，在他所认识的苏联作家当中，写作上获得最大成就的是那些实际锻炼较多的人。奥维奇金向所有下乡劳动的中国作家致热烈的敬意。他引用一句俗语勉励中国作家深入群众，这句俗语是：“要了解一个人，必须和他一起吃下一普特盐。”
