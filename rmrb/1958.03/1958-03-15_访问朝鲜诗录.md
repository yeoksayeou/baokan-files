    Visiting Korean Poems
    Chen Yi
  Salute to the heroic Korean
    People
  Four thousand years of glorious history.
  Three thousand miles of magnificent rivers and mountains.
  Songak and Kumgang, infinitely wonderful.
  The East and West Seas bear on their shoulders.
  The Taedong River converges at Moranbong.
  Eulmil Pavilion holds traces of immortals.
  Sixty-three years of star shift.
  Heroic people have established great achievements.
  Destruction and division are bound to fail.
  The people's unification is bound to succeed.
  A strong Korea is a testament today.
  The East Wind prevails over the West Wind. (Note) On the east coast of Korea is Mount Kumgang, and near the west coast is Mount Songak, both known far and wide for their outstanding scenery. The Taedong River, Moranbong, and Eulmil Pavilion are all famous historical sites within Pyongyang, with the rivers and mountains reflecting each other, creating magnificent scenery.

  Welcoming Party at Hamhung Station
  The Hamhung station saw ten thousand people lined up,
    Waiting for honored guests to return from their tour.
    Everywhere, cheers for Kim Il-sung,
    Voices of thanks for Zhou Enlai.
    The chemical industry base is newly restored,
    The hatred of aggression is forever remembered.
    The fighting friendship is as deep as the sea,
  With snow-covered mountains.

  Visiting the Hwanghae Iron Works
    Enemy planes bombed eighty times,
  Reconstruction has been ongoing for two years.
    Looking closely at the thoroughness of the bombing,
    One understands the fearlessness in the face of difficulties in the restoration.
    Destruction only leaves evidence of guilt,
  The scale of reconstruction is even greater than before.
  Use this to tell the aggressors,
  You have been defeated again, what do you say!

  Visiting the Korean People's Army Positions
            (I)
  Digging into the mountain to create defensive positions,
    Capable of defending against nuclear fission.
  I have learned from this experience many times, humbly seeking advice to find the key.
        (II)
  Heroic positions stretching across the sea and mountains, using inferior weapons to defeat the enemy.
  There are rules in world warfare, the hearts of the people determine victory or defeat.
        (III)
  The hearts of the people determine victory or defeat, the Korean War is known worldwide.
  This contest is no small matter; peace sweeps away the clouds of war.

  Salute to Those Filling the Craters
  What did I see along the way? I replied that everywhere was filling craters.
  The aggressors dropped thousand-pound bombs, one crater requires 30,000 catties of earth to fill.
  The bombs are big and the craters are deep.
  Not afraid of ground cracks and landslides, diligently restoring the entire territory.
  Three years of bitter fighting like ancient times, one people's total liberation.
  Korea is iron-willed.

    访问朝鲜诗录
    陈毅
  向英雄的朝鲜
    人民致敬
  四千年光荣历史。
  三千里壮丽河山。
  松岳金刚妙无边。
  东海西海肩上担。
  大同江汇牡丹峰。
  乙密台上有仙踪。
  六十三年星斗换。
  英雄人民立伟功。
  破坏分裂必失败。
  人民统一定成功。
  强盛朝鲜今作证。
  东风势大胜西风。（注）朝鲜东海岸有金刚山，西海岸附近有松岳山，均风景绝胜，远近驰名。大同江、牡丹峰、乙密台，均平壤市内之名胜古迹，江山辉映，极为壮丽。咸兴车站欢迎会
  上所见咸兴车站万人排，
    等候佳宾游览回。
    处处欢呼金日成，
    声声致谢周恩来。
    化工基地新修复，
    侵略仇恨永记怀。
    战斗友谊深似海，
  皑皑白雪压山崖。
  参观黄海制铁所
    敌机轰炸八十次，
  重新修建已两年。
    细看轰炸真彻底，
    方知修复不畏难。
    破坏徒自留罪证，
  再建规模大胜前。
  借此寄语侵略者，
  汝又战败，汝何言！参观朝鲜人民军阵地
            （一）
  剖腹开山阵地陈，
    能防裂变原子能。
  我于此道三折肱，虚心求教找窍门。
        （二）英雄阵地海山横，拙劣武器胜敌人。世界兵争有规律，人心向背定输赢。
        （三）人心向背定输赢，朝鲜战争举世闻。此番较量非小可，和平横空扫战云。向填坑者致敬问我沿途所见？答曰到处填坑。侵略者扔千磅弹，一坑土填三万斤。弹大坑又深。不怕地裂土崩，全境恢复认真。三年恶战古前古，一次人民总翻身。朝鲜铁铮铮。
