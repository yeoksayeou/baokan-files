    Strive for a New Balance
    Da Ke

    The basic completion of the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production has unprecedentedly stimulated the socialist construction enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. In particular, the victorious progress of the rectification campaign has further promoted the great liberation of people's minds and the great liberation of productive forces. At present, a great leap forward torrent is sweeping the country with overwhelming force. On the production front, everyone is showing their skills and striving to be the first. Some are like dragons entering the sea, others are like tigers descending from the mountains. It's truly like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique abilities. In order to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, everyone is giving full play to their initiative and creativity, working together and striving for merits.

    Under this great leap forward situation, many regions and departments have boldly broken through the old planned targets and put forward new planned targets. As a result, some people can't help but express concern, fearing that this will disrupt the balance and lead to bad consequences.

    Yes, in the great leap forward by the whole people, there will always be situations of advancement and backwardness. Some departments and regions take the lead, while other departments and regions will temporarily lag behind. This will inevitably disrupt the balance, which will inevitably bring some unavoidable difficulties. For example, the leap forward in steel production will inevitably cause the tension in the supply of pig iron and coking coal, and the leap forward in agricultural production will inevitably cause the tension in the supply of agricultural equipment and chemical fertilizers. However, this is not a bad thing, but a good thing—a great good thing. Because Marxism-Leninism believes that the unity (balance) of opposites is relative, while the struggle of opposites is absolute. Moreover, the development process is the process of the death of old things and the emergence of new things, and this process itself is realized as the struggle of opposites. Therefore, only by breaking the balance can the old things die and new things be produced, so that things can be developed.

    Then, does this mean that we can be content with the state of imbalance? Of course not. It would be terrible if we were content with the state of imbalance. Marxism-Leninism believes that the struggle of opposites is absolute, but this struggle always ends with the victory of new things and the transformation to a new and higher qualitative state. For example, in political life, the proletariat carries out revolution, and the result is not the disintegration of society, but the further development of society. The situation is the same in economic life. Any society requires a certain proportion (balance) to be maintained between the various sectors and elements of production. However, under the capitalist system, the maintenance of this proportion is accidental, and the economy develops cyclically through periodic economic crises. One of the superiorities of socialism lies in the planned (proportional) development of the national economy, and the essence of planning lies in constantly and continuously maintaining proportional relationships. Imbalance means that advanced things break through the old balance and reach a new balance through adjustment. Only by breaking the old balance and establishing a new balance can things have a new development. The development of things is from balance through imbalance to a new balance, and then from a new balance through imbalance to a newer balance. This cycle continues endlessly, to infinity. Here, establishing a new balance is important. If we are in a state of imbalance for a long time, it will not only fail to develop things but also destroy them. Taking the production of industry and agriculture in our country as an example, in the past, industrial production has developed rapidly, while agricultural production has been relatively backward. This is an imbalance. If we do not take timely measures, it will cause the decoupling of industrial and agricultural production, and even damage the entire national economy. However, we have carried out the agricultural cooperativization movement, which has greatly improved the level of agricultural production, thereby enabling the entire national economy to achieve unprecedented development.

    It can be seen that the vulgar "balance" theory is wrong, and the view that regards imbalance as a pursuit goal is also wrong. We must both break the old balance and establish a new balance. The great leap forward will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of great imbalance. In order to promote the further development of productive forces, we must quickly take measures to strive for a new balance. The balance we strive for is definitely not the kind of balance that pulls the advanced towards the backward. We must take measures to learn from the advanced, and achieve a new balance at the level of the advanced through comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. The organization of socialist large-scale collaboration in Taiyuan and Shanghai is a good way to strive for balance. We should strive for a new balance, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can become more advanced. We want to make socialist construction in the great leap forward wave, one upsurge after another, one flood peak surpassing the other.

    力争新的平衡
    大可
    生产资料所有制方面社会主义革命的基本完成，空前地激发了广大人民的社会主义建设热忱。特别是整风运动的胜利进行，更促使了人民思想的大解放，生产力的大解放。目前，一股大跃进的洪流正以排山倒海之势泛滥全国。在生产战线上，人人大显身手，奋勇争先。这个如蛟龙入海，那个如猛虎下山。真是八仙过海，各显神通。为了多快好省地建设社会主义，大家无不发挥其积极性和创造性，同心协力，齐争功勋。
    在这种大跃进的形势下，许多地区和部门都大胆突破旧的计划指标，提出新的计划指标。于是，有的人就不禁发出忧虑，唯恐这会破坏平衡，招致恶果。
    是的，在全民大跃进中，总会出现先进和落后的情况。有些部门和地区一马当先，另外有些部门和地区就会暂时落在后面。这就必然会使平衡遭到破坏，从而必会带来某些不可避免的困难。例如，钢铁生产的跃进必会引起生铁和焦煤等供应的紧张，农业生产的跃进必会引起农业设备和化学肥料等供应的紧张。但是，这不是一件坏事，而正是一件好事，——一件天大的好事。因为马克思列宁主义认为，对立面的统一（平衡）是相对的，而对立面的斗争却是绝对的。并且，发展过程就是旧东西死亡和新东西产生的过程，而这个过程本身就是作为对立面的斗争而实现的。因此，只有打破平衡，才能使旧东西死亡，新东西产生，从而才能使事物得到发展。
    那末，这是不是说，我们可以安于不平衡的状态呢？当然不能这样。如果我们对于不平衡的状态安之若素，那就糟了。马克思列宁主义认为，对立面的斗争是绝对的，但是，这种斗争总是以新事物的胜利和向新的更高的质态的转化而告一阶段。例如，在政治生活中，无产阶级进行革命，其结果不是社会的瓦解，而是社会的进一步发展。在经济生活中，情形也是这样。任何社会都要求生产的各部门和各要素之间保持一定的比例（平衡）。不过，在资本主义制度下，这种比例的保持是偶然性的，经济是通过周期性的经济危机而循环地发展的。社会主义的优越性之一，就在于国民经济有计划（按比例）的发展，而计划化的实质就在于经常地不断地保持比例关系。不平衡就是先进的事物突破旧的平衡，通过调节达到新的平衡。只有打破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡，才能使事物有一个新的发展。事物的发展就是从平衡通过不平衡到达新的平衡，再从新的平衡通过不平衡到达更新的平衡。如此循环不已，以至无穷。这里，建立新的平衡是重要的。如果我们长期处于不平衡的状态，那就不仅不会使事物获得发展，而且会使事物遭到毁灭。就以我国工农业的生产来说，过去，工业生产有了迅速发展，而农业生产却是比较落后的。这就是一个不平衡。如果我们不及时采取措施，那就会使工农业生产发生脱节，甚至会使整个国民经济遭到破坏。但是，我们开展了农业合作化运动，大大地提高了农业生产水平，从而就使整个国民经济获得了空前的发展。
    由此可见，那种庸俗的“平衡”论是错误的，那种把不平衡作为追求目标的观点也是错误的。我们既要打破旧的平衡，又要建立新的平衡。大跃进必会出现大不平衡的现象。为了推动生产力的进一步发展，我们就要迅速采取措施，力争新的平衡。我们所要力争的平衡，决不是那种把先进拉向落后的平衡，我们必须采取措施向先进看齐，通过比先进、学先进、赶先进，在先进的水平上达到新的平衡。太原和上海等地组织社会主义大协作，这就是争取平衡的一个好办法。我们应该力争新的平衡，使落后赶上先进，使先进更加先进。我们要使社会主义建设在大跃进的波涛中，一个高潮接着一个高潮，一个洪峰赛过一个洪峰。
