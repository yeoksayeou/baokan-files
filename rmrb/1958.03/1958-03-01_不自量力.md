    Overestimating One's Capabilities
    The British Defense Minister Sandys once again clamored on the 26th: In a future war that may occur, even if the Soviet Union only uses conventional forces, the West must use strategic nuclear weapons. He also hypocritically added: "No matter how much we may dislike this, the fact is that this is the case."
    Sandys' tone is as if Britain is the monopolist of nuclear weapons in the world today. However, Sandys may have forgotten due to his swollen head that Britain is neither a monopolist of nuclear weapons today, nor a strong nuclear power, and is, on the contrary, the most vulnerable country to devastating strikes in a nuclear war that may occur in the future.
    Does Sandys really think that Britain can hold its head high just because it has become a missile base for the United States?

    不自量力
    英国国防大臣桑迪斯26日再一次叫嚣：在未来可能发生的战争中，那怕苏联只用常规部队，西方也必须用战略核武器。他还假惺惺地补充道：“不论我们可能多么不喜欢这一点，事实上情况就是这样”。
    桑迪斯的口气，活像英国是今天世界上核武器的垄断者。但是，桑迪斯可能因脑袋发胀而忘记了：英国今天既不是核武器的垄断者，也远非核武器的强国，而且在未来一旦发生的核战争中，倒是最易遭受毁灭性打击的国家。
    难道桑迪斯难道认为，英国成了美国的导弹基地，就能把尾巴翘起来了吗？
