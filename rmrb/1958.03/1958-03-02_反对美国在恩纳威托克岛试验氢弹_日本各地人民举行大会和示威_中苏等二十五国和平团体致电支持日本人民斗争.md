Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch, Tokyo: The Japan National Conference for Joint Asian-African Action to Stop Hydrogen Bomb Tests on Eniwetok Atoll was held in Tokyo on the 1st. The conference issued a declaration opposing hydrogen bomb tests on Eniwetok Atoll, expressing the hope that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union would sign an agreement to immediately and unconditionally ban nuclear weapon tests, and also requesting the Japanese government to cooperate with Asian and African countries to call for a high-level East-West meeting to stop the nuclear arms race.

The declaration pointed out that the hydrogen bomb test on Eniwetok Atoll is a dangerous attempt leading to atomic war, which will intensify the race of nuclear weapons and arms expansion, threatening the safety of people of all countries in the world. The declaration said that this US test plan has aroused the indignation of the Japanese people and the people of the world. The declaration stated that all participants in the conference will do their best to eliminate war and realize a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia and Africa. The declaration also called on all Japanese people and people all over the world to unite and strive for the success of the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

The resolution passed by the conference demanded that the US government immediately stop hydrogen bomb tests on Eniwetok Atoll, support the American people's protest ship to Eniwetok Atoll, and oppose turning Okinawa into an atomic and hydrogen bomb base, and oppose turning Niijima into a missile base.

The resolution requested the Japanese government to conclude an agreement with the US government not to bring nuclear weapons into Japan (including Okinawa). The resolution also requested the Japanese government to immediately stop arming the Self-Defense Forces with nuclear weapons.

March 1st was the fourth anniversary of the harm suffered by the hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll by the United States. At the end of last December, the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference suggested taking joint action on this day to demand a halt to the production and testing of nuclear weapons. Under the auspices of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, rallies and demonstrations were held simultaneously in more than twenty prefectures, roads, prefectures, and counties across Japan on this day to participate in the Asian-African Joint Action Day.

That afternoon, the national conference was held at the Kyoritsu Auditorium in Kanda, Tokyo. The venue was hung with moving slogans such as "Don't forget Bikini, stop the hydrogen bomb tests on Eniwetok Atoll!" and "Cooperate with the independence movements of Asian and African nations to eliminate war, atomic bombs, and hydrogen bombs!" More than 3,000 people attended the conference, including the famous physicist Dr. Hideki Yukawa, the chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, the Indian ambassador to Japan, Jeha, the Egyptian chargé d'affaires in Japan, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, Abderrahmane Kiouane (transliteration), as well as trade union members, women, and students.

Mr. Hisashi Fukada, a fifty-five-year-old atomic bomb victim from Isahaya City, Nagasaki Prefecture, disregarded his doctor's advice and, with the support of his sixteen-year-old daughter, traveled a long way to Tokyo to participate in the conference while seriously ill. Masahiko Onuma, the representative of Niijima, who is fighting against the construction of a missile test site, also rushed to Tokyo to participate in the conference.

Mr. Ikuo Yasui, the director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, made a report at the meeting, proposing the suggestion of "taking joint action with the people of Asian and African countries to stop the hydrogen bomb test on Eniwetok Atoll." In his speech, Hideki Yukawa emphasized the harm of atomic and hydrogen bombs to mankind and demanded an immediate halt to nuclear weapon tests. He said that this is the only way to truly guarantee world peace and make science serve mankind.

The conference received sixty-three congratulatory telegrams and letters from twenty-five countries, including the China Asian Solidarity Committee and the Soviet Peace Council.

The Algerian representative emphasized at the meeting that the people of Algeria and Japan should unite more closely in the future and carry out joint struggles for peace and independence.

Representatives from the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party of Japan all spoke at the meeting. The speeches by Mrs. Aikichi Kuboyama, a victim of Bikini Atoll, and Hisashi Fukada, a victim in Nagasaki, moved all those present.

On the same morning, more than 150 students from the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations held a demonstration in front of the US Embassy, insisting that the US government cancel nuclear weapon tests on Eniwetok Atoll.

    宣言指出，恩纳威托克岛的氢弹试验是通往原子战争的危险尝试，将会使核武器和扩充军备的竞赛更加激烈起来，威胁世界各国人民的安全。宣言说，美国这个试验计划引起了日本人民和全世界人民的愤慨。宣言表示，大会全体参加者将竭尽全力为消灭战争、实现亚非无核子武器地区而努力。宣言还号召全日本人民和全世界人民团结起来努力争取第四届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的成功。
    大会通过的决议要求美国政府立即停止在恩纳威托克岛的氢弹试验，支持美国人民前往恩纳威托克岛的抗议船，并且反对把冲绳岛变为原子弹和氢弹基地，反对把新岛变为导弹基地。
    决议要求日本政府同美国政府缔结不把核武器运进日本（包括冲绳）境内的协定。决议还要求日本政府立即停止以核武器武装自卫队。
    3月1日是美国在比基尼岛的氢弹试验受害四周年的日子。去年12月底亚非人民团结大会曾经建议在这一天采取共同行动要求停止生产和试验核武器。在日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的主持下，这一天在日本全国二十多个都、道、府、县同时举行了大会和示威游行，参加亚非共同行动日。
    当天下午，全国大会在东京神田的共立讲堂举行。会场上挂着“不要忘记比基尼，制止恩纳威托克岛的氢弹试验！”“同亚非各民族的独立运动配合起来，消除战争、原子弹和氢弹！”等动人的标语，参加大会的有著名物理学家汤川秀树博士、日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎、印度驻日本大使杰哈、埃及驻日本代办、阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表阿布德隆·基旺（译音），以及工会会员、妇女和学生等三千余人。
    日本长崎县谏早市的原子弹受害者，五十五岁的老人深田久市，不听医生的劝阻，拖着重病的身体，由他十六岁的女儿搀扶，远道来到东京参加大会。正在为反对建设导弹试射场而进行斗争的新岛代表大沼正彦也赶到东京参加了大会。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在会上作了报告，提出了“同亚非各国人民采取共同行动来制止恩纳威托克岛的氢弹试验”的建议。汤川秀树在讲话中强调了原子弹和氢弹对人类的祸害，并且要求立即停止核武器试验。他说，这样才能使世界和平真正得到保证，并且使科学为人类服务。
    大会接到了中国亚洲团结委员会、苏联和平理事会等二十五个国家的六十三封贺电和贺信。
    阿尔及利亚代表在会上强调说，阿、日两国人民今后要更加团结起来，为和平与独立共同展开斗争。
    日本自由民主党、社会党和共产党代表都在会上讲了话。比基尼岛受害者久保山爱吉夫人和在长崎受害的深田久市的讲话使全体到会者受到了感动。
    同一天上午，日本全国学生自治会总联合会的学生一百五十多人，在美国大使馆门前举行了示威游行，坚持要求美国政府取消在恩纳威托克岛举行的核武器试验。
