Excerpts from Western Newspapers

    Words from the Heart
    We know that the government of South Korea is very unstable, and Syngman Rhee is not a good ruler. His government does not have the support of the masses.
    If the United Nations troops are withdrawn, the South Korean government will soon be overthrown…
    Because we are forced to keep foreign troops in Korea, our situation is also very difficult. Some of the countries that sent troops to the United Nations may oppose our actions and withdraw their own troops.
    — U.S. Atlanta "Constitution"

    "Taking Precautions"
    A U.S. government directive on "Actions After a Nuclear Weapons Attack" has caused Washington civil servants to burst out laughing.
    The document instructs officials that after an atomic war occurs, a form must be filled out and sent from the underground post office to the General Office of the U.S. Civil Service Commission. It will notify the State Department to decide when and where you should report.
    The instructions also include notes: Fill out the form as quickly as possible after the enemy launches an attack, but when filling out the form, you must determine how many days you will be staying in the area. If the address changes, a new form should be filled out and sent.
        — British "Daily Mail"

    由衷之言
    我们知道南朝鲜的政府很不稳定，李承晚并不是一个很好的统治者，他的政府得不到群众的支持。
    如果撤退联合国的军队，南朝鲜政府很快就会被推翻……
    由于我们被迫在朝鲜保留外国军队，我们的处境也就很困难，联合国某些出兵的国家可能反对我们的做法，并把他们自己的军队撤走。
    ——美国阿特兰大“宪法报”
    “未雨绸缪”
    美国政府发出的一份关于“受到核武器攻击后的行动”的指示，使得华盛顿的文职官员大笑不已。
    这份文件指示官员们说：在原子战争发生后，必须填好一份表格从地下邮局寄交美国文官委员会总办公室，它将通知国务院决定你应在何时向何处报到。
    指示还附有注意事项：敌人发动攻击后，尽可能迅速填表，但填表时，必须确定在该地居留几天，住址如有更动，应另填新表寄上。
        ——英国“每日邮报”
