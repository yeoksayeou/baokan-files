    Western Press Clippings
    Fantasies of Warmongers
    American Air Force leaders are considering manufacturing a new type of non-lethal weapon. These new weapons include: itch-inducing powder, laughter-inducing gas, and machines that emit loud noises.

    Thirty-eight-year-old Peter Schenck is in charge of this plan. He is the chairman of the Air Force Association (an organization of retired and active duty Air Force officers) and also a director of General Electric.

    Soldiers attacked by laughing gas would be unable to resist stubbornly. If Russian or Chinese soldiers had itch-inducing powder seeped into their uniforms, they would be of little use on rocket launching platforms.

    Dangerous Scrap Iron
    A British Labour Party member of Parliament said that the American "Thor" missiles deployed at British launch sites are "a pile of scrap iron."

    John Rankin said he knew that "this weapon has been tested ten times, failed to explode five times, and never hit its intended target even once. The US Army refused to accept this weapon, and there is no guarantee that it will fly in the aimed direction when launched."

    On the 11th, an American plane carrying nuclear weapons dropped an atomic bomb over Florence due to equipment failure. Although it did not explode, the booster on the bomb exploded, collapsing and damaging nearby houses (lower left corner of the picture). The upper right corner of the picture shows the crater.

    好战者的狂想
    美国的空军首脑们已考虑制造一批新式的非致命性的武器。这种新式武器有：使人身上发痒的粉末，令人大笑的毒气和能够发出吵闹声音的机器。
    三十八岁的彼得·史清克是这项计划的负责人。他是空军协会（一个退役和现役的空军军官的组织）的主席，同时也是通用电气公司的董事。
    受到发笑毒气袭击的士兵，就无力顽强反抗。俄国兵或中国兵的军服里渗进了能使身上发痒的粉末，他在火箭发射台上就作用不大。

    危险的废铁
    有一位英国工党议员说，将配置在英国发射基地上的美国“雷神”式导弹是“一大堆废铁”。
    约翰兰金说，他知道“这种武器已经试验过十回，有五回没有爆炸，并且连一次也没有击中瞄准了的目标。美国陆军曾经拒绝接受这种武器，在发射这种武器时，一点也不能保证它会朝瞄准好的方向飞出去。”

    美国一架载有核武器的飞机11日在弗洛仑斯上空，由于装置失灵扔下了一枚原子核炸弹。虽然没有爆炸，但是弹上的助发器爆炸了，把附近的房屋震坍震坏（图左下角）。图的右上角是弹坑。　（新华社稿）
