Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, March 17th: Two major "leaps forward" have appeared on the construction site of Baotou Iron and Steel Company. Not only are leading cadres participating in physical labor, but functional personnel are also shedding the bureaucratic airs of sitting in the office and are going to the construction site to work. Workers wrote big-character posters praising their approach as a "revolutionary action."

In the dozens of engineering teams of each engineering company, the attendance clerks, quota clerks, material clerks, and payroll clerks mostly stayed in their offices in the past. This forced team leaders to spend half their time running errands and queuing in front of the desks of functional personnel, hindering the progress and quality of the team's projects. Workers were very dissatisfied with this phenomenon, satirizing the functional personnel as the "Five Great Staff" or "Six Great Staff."

During this Two-Anti movement, workers used thousands of big-character posters to attack this bureaucracy. In addition, with leading cadres at all levels going to the site to work, the functional personnel could no longer sit still in their offices. During rectification, they went to the site one after another. Quota clerks and attendance clerks went to the site for attendance and quota issuance; material clerks did not use temporary workers, but pushed small carts to deliver materials and tools to the teams themselves; cost accountants and others also took their ledgers to the site to work. Some spent half a day on business and half a day on labor. This facilitated the work of team leaders and workers and improved the work.

Because the functional personnel truly faced the site and served the project and the workers, the workers felt particularly satisfied and their enthusiasm was even greater. The relationship between employees has also become closer. Wu Fenglin, the payroll clerk who used to be listed as one of the several major staff, delivered wages to each worker this month. Scaffold worker Liu Dianbi was working at high altitude and jokingly teased him, "If you have the ability, send it up!" Wu Fenglin immediately climbed up the pole. Liu Dianbi took the salary and smiled kindly: "Lao Wu, you are really leaping forward!"

This newspaper reports: Some departments of the state-owned Nanjing Chenguang Machine Factory actively solicited opinions from workshops during the Two-Anti movement and solved problems on the spot, greatly promoting the leap forward in production and were welcomed by the masses.

The Supply and Marketing Section put forward the slogan of supplying whatever the workshop needs and visited several key workshops separately. The Eleventh Workshop urgently needed a type of steel pipe, but the Supply and Marketing Section did not have the ready-made specifications. Comrade Hao Guitang, who was in charge of the pipe drawing machine, lit the stove overnight and insisted on working for more than ten hours to draw the steel pipe and send it to the workshop. Once, the workshop reported that the task of the 1325 machine tool could not be completed, mainly due to insufficient materials. After hearing this, the comrades of the Supply and Marketing Section mobilized all the comrades in the section to send materials to the workshop that night. Everyone worked from 10:30 in the evening until 2:00 in the morning, carrying and lifting, transporting fifty-four tons of parts to the workshop in one go, meeting the needs of the workshop.

On-site rectification helped the section staff overcome conservative ideas. When the leaders of the Supply and Marketing Section initially proposed to try their best to meet the planning requirements of the workshop, many comrades opposed it, believing that the supply and marketing department could not do a good job. After on-site visits and on-site rectification, everyone changed their views. Now they have taken the leap forward plan one step further.

In the units where on-site rectification was better, the reform of the production management system was further promoted. The Mechanical Power Section is an auxiliary workshop. When a new product was trial-produced last year, because the procedure was too complicated and the system was too cumbersome, a small faucet, with only six parts, took more than two months to trial-produce. This time, they broke the routine. The section chief, process engineer, and material clerk all went deep into the site, handed the preliminary design drawings of the new product to the masses for discussion, and organized special personnel to be responsible. The workers trial-produced while the process engineer modified the drawings, completing the process equipment during the trial production. The workers were also in high spirits, working hard overnight, studying and cooperating with each other. As a result, this three-ton hoist with forty-four parts and one hundred and twenty-five processes was successfully trial-produced in only forty-eight hours (originally planned to take a month), and the quality fully met the requirements.

### 材料送上门　工资送到手  包钢和晨光机器厂的职能人员改变旧作风

    材料送上门　工资送到手
    包钢和晨光机器厂的职能人员改变旧作风
    据新华社包头17日电　包头钢铁公司建筑工地出现了“两大跃进”，不但领导干部参加体力劳动，而且职能人员也打掉稳坐办公室的官气，纷纷到施工现场办公。工人写大字报称赞他们的做法是“革命行动”。
    各工程公司的几十个工程队里的考勤员、定额员、材料员、工资员等职能人员，过去大部分不出办公室。害得小组长们常常用半天时间跑腿和在职能人员的办公桌前排队，妨害了小组的工程进展和质量。工人对这种现象很不满意，讽刺职能人员是“五大员”、“六大员”。
    这次双反运动中，工人们用成千上万张大字报向这种官气开了火。加上各级领导干部都到现场劳动，职能人员在办公室也坐不稳了。他们在整改中纷纷下现场。定额员和考勤员到现场考勤、签发定额；材料员不用临时工，自己推小车向小组送材料和工具；成本核算员等也挟着账本子到现场办公了。有的半天搞业务，半天劳动。这样就便利了小组长和工人，改进了工作。
    由于职能人员真正作到面向现场，为工程和工人服务，工人们感到特别满意，干劲更大了。职工间的关系也更为亲密了。过去被列为几大员之一的工资员武凤林，这个月把工资送到了每个工人手里。架子工刘殿弼正在高空干活，故意向他打趣说：“有本事的送上来！”武凤林马上攀着杆子爬了上去。刘殿弼接过工资，亲切地笑着说：“老武，你们真是跃进了！”
    本报讯　国营南京晨光机器厂有些科室在双反运动中，主动到车间征求意见，就地解决问题，大大推动了生产的跃进，受到了群众的欢迎。
    供销科提出了车间需要什么就供应什么的口号，分别到几个关键车间去访问。十一车间急需的一种钢管，供销科没有现成规格的，负责拉管机的郝贵堂同志便连夜生起炉子，坚持干了十多小时，把钢管拉好送到车间去。有一次车间反映1325机床的任务完不成，主要原因是材料不足。供销科的同志听了，当晚动员全科的同志给车间送材料，大家从晚上十点半钟一直干到后半夜两点钟，扛的扛，抬的抬，一口气把五十四吨零件运到车间里，满足了车间的需要。
    现场整改帮助了科室人员克服保守思想。供销科领导方面开始提出要尽量满足车间要求的规划时，许多同志都反对，认为供销部门根本不能搞好工作。经过现场访问，现场整改后，大家都改变了看法。现在他们又把跃进规划提高了一步。
    在现场整改改得较好的单位，还进一步促进了生产管理制度的改革。机械动力科是一个辅助车间，去年试制新产品的时候，因程序太复杂，制度太繁琐，一个小小的自来水龙头，仅仅六个零件，竟搞了两个多月才试成。这次他们打破常规，科长、工艺员、材料员都深入现场，把新产品的初步设计图纸交给群众讨论，组织专人负责，工人一边试制，工艺员一边修改图纸，在试制过程中完成工艺装置。工人情绪也很高，连夜突击，互相研究，互相协作，结果这一个有四十四个零件，一百二十五道工序的三吨葫芦，只花了四十八小时就试制成功（原计划需要一个月），质量也完全合乎要求。　（张竟）
