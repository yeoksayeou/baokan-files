Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd: Soviet Ambassador to France Vinogradov visited French Foreign Minister Pineau on March 1st and handed him Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's reply letter.

The following is the full text of the letter.

“Dear Minister,

I have carefully studied your letter of February 13 regarding the preparation of the summit meeting. In this reply, I would like to discuss some of my views.

You agree that a summit meeting must be convened, and you rightly point out that there are different views on how to ensure the rapid and effective preparation of the meeting. At the same time, you referred to the French government's position as outlined in Mr. Gaillard's letter of January 14, stating that it is necessary to arrange a meeting of foreign ministers to prepare the agenda for the summit meeting and to resolve the issue of participating members. You said that the preliminary diplomatic contacts on the issue of meeting preparation, in your view, are 'fundamentally insufficient to inspire any hope,' attempting to justify the French government's position.

In view of your views, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the sole desire of the Soviet government in suggesting holding a summit meeting directly without a prior meeting of foreign ministers is to facilitate the most rapid convening of the summit. We believe that in the current international situation, such a meeting is most likely to lay the foundation for easing tensions between countries, especially between Eastern and Western countries, which is what the people of all countries yearn for. Our concerns about the procedure you proposed of first convening a foreign ministers' meeting to prepare for the summit meeting are well known, and these concerns cannot be completely eliminated due to the reasons the Soviet government has repeatedly drawn attention to.

After exchanging views with our ambassadors to Western countries, we have come to the conclusion that major powers, including France, are concerned about holding a summit meeting. At the same time, it can be determined that Western countries currently do not insist on a prior meeting of foreign ministers as an indispensable condition for holding a summit meeting and believe that the necessary preparations for the summit meeting can also be carried out through ordinary diplomatic channels.

Under these circumstances, in order to reach an agreement on convening a meeting with the participation of heads of government as soon as possible, and taking into account that Western governments, including the French government, are still more willing to convene a foreign ministers' meeting first, the Soviet government believes it can agree to: continue negotiations through diplomatic channels while convening a foreign ministers' meeting in the near future to resolve the following limited tasks: prepare the agenda for the summit meeting and determine the members of the meeting. At the same time, we believe that a reliable agreement on the date of the summit meeting should be reached before the foreign ministers' meeting is convened.

The Soviet government proposes that the meeting of foreign ministers be held in Geneva in April this year, and the meeting of heads of government be held in June this year.

We learned from your conversation with the Soviet Ambassador to Paris that the French government does not object to our proposal: the members of both the foreign ministers' meeting and the summit meeting should be determined on an equal basis. For example, if the West is represented by France, the United States, Britain, and Italy, then the East should be represented by the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. What remains to be agreed upon is the issue of allowing certain countries that have not joined existing military-political blocs to participate in the meeting, as proposed in our suggestion of January 8.

Therefore, it is appropriate to finalize the members, date, and location of the preparatory meeting attended by foreign ministers, as well as the date of the summit meeting, through diplomatic negotiations in the near future.

Regarding the agenda for the summit meeting that you raised in your letter, I would like to inform you that we believe that the issues included in the agenda should be those that all participants of the meeting are willing to discuss. In other words, issues should only be included in the agenda after both parties have reached an agreement. We also believe that there is no reason to include in the meeting agenda issues that, due to their complexity or lack of consensus, are unlikely to be satisfactorily resolved. Therefore, we suggest that only those issues that are reasonably certain to reach an agreement should be discussed at the meeting.

We believe that including issues in the agenda for which a mutually agreeable solution cannot be expected at present will only complicate the process of the summit meeting. The examples you cited in your letter precisely prove this point. You suggested discussing the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and the issue of German reunification at the same time. However, it is clear that these are two unrelated issues.

The issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is an international issue that can be discussed and resolved at the summit meeting based on the current situation in Central Europe. It is no accident that people of various political views in European countries (including France) advocate a satisfactory solution to this issue. It is also very important that the necessary prerequisites for solving this problem already exist. As everyone knows, three of the four countries directly related to the establishment of such a zone—Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic—have already declared their agreement to join the aforementioned zone. Now it is up to the Federal Republic of Germany, which has not yet agreed to join this zone. The major powers that station troops and possess nuclear weapons on German territory must also express their views on the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Therefore, it can be considered that the time is ripe for discussing this issue at the summit meeting.

The issue of restoring German unification is mainly a matter for the Germans themselves, and this issue is unrelated to the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This is a matter of relations between the two existing German states, and this issue can and should be resolved within the scope of their relations by reaching appropriate agreements between them.

Therefore, intertwining the above two issues, even if it does not directly hinder reaching an agreement on such an important international issue as the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, will greatly complicate the issue.

Minister, you also suggested linking the issue of stopping nuclear weapon tests with the issue of producing fissionable materials. However, everyone knows that the issue of stopping atomic weapon tests is independent, while the issue of stopping the production of fissionable materials is part of the overall issue of stopping the production and banning the use of atomic weapons and destroying all nuclear weapon stockpiles. Due to the position of Western countries, it is difficult to imagine that the summit meeting can pass any resolutions on the latter issue, but the summit meeting can immediately pass positive resolutions on the issue of stopping atomic weapon tests.

One cannot disagree with the view that political conditions plus psychological conditions are of great significance to the success of the meeting. In our opinion, these conditions are currently in place. The following fact primarily illustrates this point: we all agree that a summit meeting must be held, and broad sections of people in all countries warmly support the convening of such a meeting. At the same time, I must point out that your accusations against the statements made by Soviet social figures and government officials on the international stage and domestically regarding the colonialist policies of certain countries are unfounded. Soviet public opinion cannot but feel concerned about the events currently taking place in Algeria. The flames of war have been burning there non-stop for three years. Out of sympathy for the Algerian national liberation movement, Soviet public representatives at the Cairo Conference advocated supporting the demands of the Algerian people. We believe that this is of no loss to the interests of France, because these remarks are only directed at the outdated colonialist policies opposed by many prominent figures in France itself. We still advocate resolving the Algerian issue within the scope of French-Algerian relations, and we believe that the French government's continued attempt to resolve this pressing issue by force will make it increasingly less hopeful of finding a solution within the scope of French-Algerian relations.

The recent bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef by the French Air Force, in our view, has made a peaceful resolution of this important issue even more distant.

Is the use of force against a sovereign state simply because it is relatively weak the method that member states of the United Nations should adopt when disputes arise? Do you, Minister, feel that this method directly violates the United Nations Charter and does nothing to help resolve disputes?

We agree with your view that improving Franco-Soviet relations would greatly promote the easing of international tensions. You rightly pointed out that in recent years, we have made significant progress in cultural and economic ties between the Soviet Union and France. I think you will not deny that the Soviet Union has made a great contribution to this cause.

The Soviet Union has always advocated expanding trade and other forms of economic cooperation with all countries, including France. However, the economic ties between the Soviet Union and France have not reached the level they should be, and the fault does not lie with us. Trade is a two-way street. We hope to develop trade on the basis of mutual benefit and the firm principle of taking into account the interests of both parties, so that both countries benefit. Everyone knows that French business people also advocate developing ties with the Soviet Union on the above basis. But in reality, there are serious obstacles in this regard. Discrimination and various embargo policies certainly hinder the development of trade and economic relations.

It must be frankly pointed out that if the issue of Franco-Soviet economic relations cannot be resolved in the capitals of the two countries, then it is difficult to expect any fundamental improvement in this issue.

Therefore, I think it is appropriate to remind you that as early as May 17, 1957, the Soviet government put forward a series of suggestions that would help consolidate and expand Soviet-French relations. For example, we have proposed such suggestions: establishing broader and more stable ties between our two countries, opening trade representative offices in Moscow and Paris to study the possibility of expanding Franco-Soviet trade more deeply and systematically, the Soviet Union and France holding industrial and agricultural exhibitions in each other's countries, implementing cooperation in the development of fuel and power bases, and providing each other with economic and financial assistance. I think the practical significance of these suggestions has not disappeared now. In its reply note issued on June 7, 1957, the French government acknowledged that there were still untapped possibilities in Franco-Soviet relations, but it did not substantively respond to the aforementioned suggestions. I believe that continuing to exchange views on these issues and other issues that the French government may raise will help improve relations between our two countries, thereby strengthening trust and helping to ease tensions. Minister, please accept my highest regards to you."

    葛罗米柯复信比诺提出新建议
    四月开外长会议六月开首脑会议
    尽速通过外交谈判确定预备会议的成员等问题
    新华社4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联驻法国大使维诺格拉多夫3月1日拜访了法国外交部长比诺，把苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的回信转交给他。
    下面是这封信的全文。
    “尊敬的部长先生：
    我仔细地研究了您2月13日发出的关于准备最高级会议问题的信件。在这封回信中，我想谈谈下面一些看法。
    您同意必须召开高级会议，并且公正地指出，对于用什么办法才能保证会议准备工作迅速而有成效地进行，存在着不同的看法。同时，您谈到盖伊阿先生在1月14日信中所阐述的法国政府的立场，谈到必须安排外长会见来准备政府首脑会议议程和解决参加会议的成员问题。您说，就会议准备问题进行的初步的外交接触，据您看来，‘根本不足以令人抱有任何希望’，企图以此来证明法国政府的主张。
    鉴于您提出了这种看法，我愿意提请您注意，苏联政府之所以建议不预先召开外长会议而直接召开政府首脑会议，唯一的愿望就是促使高级会议最迅速地召开。我们认为，在当前的国际局势下，这种会议最有可能为各国人民所热望的缓和各国之间的紧张局势、特别是缓和东西方国家之间的紧张局势奠定开端。我们对你们提出的先召开外长会议来准备政府首脑会议的程序的担心是大家都知道的，这种担心由于苏联政府已经不止一次地提醒注意的那些理由，仍然不可能完全消除。
    经过我国驻西方国家大使同这些国家交换意见以后，我们得出了这样一种看法，即各大国，其中也包括法国，都对举行最高级会议表示关心。同时可以断定，目前西方国家没有提出把预先召开外长会议作为召开高级会议的一个不可缺少的条件，并且认为，高级会议的必要的准备工作也可以通过普通外交途径来进行。
    在这种条件下，为了能就尽快地召开有政府首脑参加的会议达成协议，并且考虑到包括法国政府在内的西方国家政府仍然比较愿意先召开外长会议，苏联政府认为可以同意：一面继续通过外交途径进行谈判，一面在最近召开外长会议，来解决以下有限的任务：准备政府首脑会议的议程和确定会议的成员。同时，我们认为，在召开外长会议之前，要就召开政府首脑会议的日期达成可靠的协议。
    苏联政府建议外交部长会议在今年4月在日内瓦召开，政府首脑会议在今年6月召开。
    我们从您同苏联驻巴黎大使的谈话中得知，法国政府不反对我们的建议：无论是外交部长会议或者是政府首脑会议的成员都要在对等的基础上确定。例如，西方有法国、美国、英国和意大利出席，而东方参加会议的就要有苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚。还有待协议的就是让某些没有加入现有军事政治集团的国家参加会议的问题，这些国家在我们1月8日的建议中已经提出。
    因此，在最近时期经过外交谈判来最后确定由外交部长参加的预备会议的成员、日期和地点以及召开政府首脑会议的日期，是适宜的。
    至于您在信中提出的政府首脑会议的议程问题，我愿意告诉您，我们认为，列入议程中的问题应该是会议的所有参加者都愿意讨论的问题，换句话说，各项问题应经过双方取得协议后，才列入议程。我们还认为，没有理由把这样一些问题列入会议议程，这些问题由于它们的复杂性或者由于缺乏相同的观点，因而没有可能求得圆满的解决。因此，我们建议，在会议上只讨论那些在某种程度上有把握能够达成协议的问题。
    我们认为，把那些在目前还无法指望求得双方同意的解决办法的问题列入议程，只会使政府首脑会议的进程复杂化。您的来信中援引的那些例子正好可以证明这一点。您建议同时讨论在中欧建立无原子武器地区的计划和德国统一的问题。然而，很明显，这是两个互不相干的问题。
    关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的问题是一个国际问题，可以在高级会议上根据中欧的现状加以讨论和解决。欧洲各国（其中包括法国）的各种不同政治见解的人士都主张圆满解决这个问题，这并不是偶然的。现在已经有了解决这个问题的必要的先决条件，这点也是非常重要的。大家知道，同建立这种地区直接有关的四个国家中有三个国家——波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国已经声明同意加入上述地区。现在就要看德意志联邦共和国了，它还没有同意加入这个地区。在德国领土上驻扎军队并且拥有核武器的各大国也必须就关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的问题发表自己的意见。因此，可以认为，在政府首脑会议上讨论这个问题的时机已经成熟了。
    恢复德国统一的问题主要是德国人自己的事，这个问题同建立无原子武器地区问题无关。这是现存的两个德国之间的关系问题，这个问题能够而且应该在这两国的关系范围内，通过在它们之间达成适当的协议的方式来加以解决。
    因此，把上述两个问题纠缠在一起，即使不是直接阻碍在像建立欧洲无原子武器地区这样重要的国际问题上达成协议，也会使问题大大复杂化。
    部长先生，您还建议把停止试验核武器问题同生产裂变物质问题联系起来。但是，谁都知道，停止试验原子武器问题具有独立的性质，而停止生产裂变物质问题却是停止生产和禁止使用原子武器以及销毁一切核武器储备这个总问题中的一部分。由于西方国家的立场，要使政府首脑会议能就后一个问题通过什么决议，是很难设想的，但是对于停止试验原子武器问题，最高级会议可以立即通过积极的决议。
    不能不同意这样一种看法：政治条件加上心理条件对于会议的成功具有很大的意义。根据我们的意见，目前这些条件是具备了。下面这一事实首先说明了这一点：我们大家都同意必须举行最高级会议，各国广大阶层人民热烈支持召开这种会议。同时，我要指出，您对于苏联社会人士和政府人士在国际舞台上以及在国内对某些国家的殖民主义政策发表的言论的指责是没有根据的。苏联舆论对目前在阿尔及利亚发生的事件自然不能不感到忧虑。在那里战火已经不停息地燃烧了三年。由于对阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的同情，苏联公众代表在开罗会议上主张支持阿尔及利亚人民的要求。我们认为，这对法国的利益没有任何损失，因为这些言论只是针对为法国本国很多著名人士所反对的、过时的殖民主义政策的。我们仍然主张在法国—阿尔及利亚关系范围内解决阿尔及利亚问题，我们认为，法国政府继续企图用武力解决这个迫切的问题，就会使它越来越很少有希望在法国和阿尔及利亚的关系范围内求得解决。
    最近法国空军对突尼斯村庄萨基埃特—西迪—优素福的轰炸，在我们看来，使得这一重要问题的和平解决越来越远了。
    难道仅仅因为某个主权国家比较弱就对它动用武力，这是联合国会员国发生争端时所应该采用的方法吗？您，部长先生，是否觉得，这种方法直接违反联合国宪章，而且丝毫无助于争端的解决呢？
    我们同意您的这种看法：改善法苏关系会在很大的程度上促进国际紧张局势的缓和。您正确地指出，最近几年以来，我们在苏法两国文化和经济联系方面取得了显著的进展。我想您不会否认苏联对这一事业作出了很大贡献。
    苏联过去和现在始终主张同一切国家，包括同法国扩大贸易和其他形式的经济合作。但是苏法两国之间的经济联系没有达到应有的水平，其过错不在我们身上。贸易是双方的事情。我们希望在互利的基础上、根据考虑到双方利益的坚定原则来发展贸易，使两国都有利。大家知道，法国商界人士也主张在上述的基础上同苏联发展联系。但实际上，在这个问题方面却存在着严重的障碍。歧视和种种禁运货单政策当然阻碍着贸易和经济关系的发展。
    必须坦率地指出，如果法苏两国的经济关系问题在两国首都解决不了，那就很难指望在这个问题上有根本改善。
    因此，我认为向您提醒一下这一点是合宜的：早在1957年5月17日，苏联政府就提出了一系列有助于巩固和扩大苏法关系的建议。例如，我们提出过这样一些建议：我们两国之间建立更广泛的稳定联系，在莫斯科和巴黎开设贸易代理处来更深入和有系统地研究扩大法苏贸易的可能性，苏联和法国分别在对方举办工农业展览会，在发展燃料动力基地方面实行合作，互相给予经济和财政援助等。我看这些建议的现实意义现在也并未消失。法国政府在1957年6月7日发出的复照中承认法苏关系中还有未加利用的可能性，然而它并没有对上述建议的实质作出答复。我认为，继续就这些问题以及法国政府可能提出的其他问题交换意见会有助于改进我们两国之间的关系，从而加强信任和有助于缓和紧张局势。部长先生，谨请您接受我对您的崇高敬意。”
