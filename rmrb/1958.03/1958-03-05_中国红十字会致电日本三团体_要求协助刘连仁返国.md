Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Chinese Red Cross sent a telegram on the 3rd to the Liaison Office of the three Japanese groups, requesting that the three Japanese groups investigate the detailed experiences of Liu Lianren, a Chinese citizen who was abducted from Shandong Province to Japan by the Japanese army in 1944 to perform forced labor and who lived in a cave in the wilderness of Hokkaido for thirteen years to escape persecution by the Japanese army, as well as Liu Lianren's health condition. They also hoped that the three groups would assist Liu Lianren in returning safely to China as soon as possible.

The Chinese Red Cross expressed deep concern for Liu Lianren's experiences in the telegram, and remitted 500 yuan in RMB, asking the three groups to forward it to Liu Lianren, and also asked the three groups to convey their condolences to Liu Lianren.
