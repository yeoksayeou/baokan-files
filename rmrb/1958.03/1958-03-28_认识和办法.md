　　Understanding and Methods

　　When we undertake a task, if we don't have a correct understanding of the issue in our minds, which is what people often call "not having thought it through," then it's safe to say that we won't find effective methods to complete the task in our work, and naturally, we won't be able to complete the task well. Conversely, if we have thought it through, does that necessarily mean we can complete the task well? Not necessarily. We also need effective measures and methods to complete the task. The experience of Daxing Cooperative in breeding livestock tells us that while it is very important to clarify thinking and correct understanding, if the cooperative members only understand the importance of the self-breeding and self-raising policy but do not solve the contradiction between breeding livestock and current agricultural production, Daxing Cooperative could not have transformed from a donkey village into a cooperative with herds of mules and horses. From this, it can be seen that correct understanding is only the prerequisite for realizing the policy, and effective measures are the necessary means for realizing the policy. Therefore, when the masses have leap-forward thinking and have formulated leap-forward goals, the leader's responsibility lies in mobilizing the masses to find measures to achieve the leap-forward goals.

    认识和办法
    当我们执行某项任务的时候，如果思想上对这个问题没有正确的认识，也就是人们常说的“思想没搞通”，那么可以断定，在工作中就一定不会找到完成任务的有效办法，自然也就不能很好地完成任务。反过来说，若是思想搞通了，是不是就一定能够很好地完成任务呢？不一定，还需要有完成任务的有效措施和办法。大兴社繁殖牲畜的经验告诉我们：打通思想、端正认识固然十分重要，但是，如果社员们只是懂得了自繁自养方针的重要性，而没有解决繁殖牲畜与当前农业生产的矛盾的办法，大兴社也不可能由驴子村变成骡马成群社的。由此可见，认识正确只是实现方针的前提，有效措施是实现方针的必要手段。因此，当群众有了跃进思想，制定了跃进目标之后，领导者的责任就在于发动群众，寻找实现跃进目标的措施。
