    How Much Influence?
    Macmillan said in London on the 14th: His influence on American foreign policy is greater than it appears; the reason people underestimate him is that he "didn't publish every telegram and every conversation."
    On the same day, his Minister of Supply, Aubrey Jones, also gave a speech in Birmingham. This minister complained that the United States "clung tightly" to certain military technology secrets, and even indignantly said: "I think an alliance controlled by a major partner who is unwilling to disclose important modern military knowledge is probably no longer a sound alliance."
    It is remembered that one of the requests Macmillan made to Eisenhower during his visit to Washington last October was for the United States to open its "scientific iron curtain" in military technology. As a result, the United States seemed to accept Macmillan's influence and wrote this into the communiqué of that meeting. However, five months have passed, and the United States' promise has turned out to be a blank check.
    Therefore, Aubrey Jones's speech was actually a slap in the face to his Prime Minister. The few documents that have already been published are enough to prove how pitiful Macmillan's influence on American foreign policy is. If "every telegram and every conversation" were really published, then the British Prime Minister would obviously be even more exposed and humiliated.
    Outdated Dream
    According to the "Washington Post," some French generals suggested launching a full-scale blitzkrieg against Tunisia. They even made guarantees: They would definitely be able to occupy the entire country of Tunisia within three days.
    It seems that these arrogant generals are so deeply infatuated with the long-outdated "gunboat diplomacy" that they have completely forgotten what era they are living in. They once launched a "blitzkrieg" against Egypt with their British partners, resulting in a shameful defeat. They also boasted that they would quell the "rebellion" in Algeria in three months or even less, but the war has lasted for more than three years, and their own situation is becoming more and more unfavorable. However, the lessons of these facts have not made them any wiser.
    I advise these French generals to wake up! Indulging in the old dreams of the colonial era, thinking that waving a saber can solve all problems, will inevitably lead to a bloody nose in real life.

    札记
    影响多大？
    麦克米伦14日在伦敦说：他对美国外交政策的影响比表面上看来要多些；人们所以会对他估计过低，原因是他“没有把每一份电报和每一次交谈情况都发表出来”。
    就在同一天，他的军需供应大臣奥布里·琼斯在伯明翰也发表一次谈话。这位大臣埋怨美国把某些军事技术秘密“紧紧抱住不放”，甚至愤愤不平地说：“我认为，由一个不愿把重要的现代军事知识公开出来的大伙伴所控制的联盟，大概不再是一个健全的联盟。”
    人们记得，要美国在军事技术方面打开“科学铁幕”，这是去年10月麦克米伦到华盛顿去和艾森豪威尔举行会谈时所提出的要求之一。结果，美国似乎接受了麦克米伦的影响，把这一点写在那次会谈公报上了。可是，时间过了五个月，美国的允诺原来是一张空头支票。
    因此，奥布里·琼斯的谈话，实际上是在他的首相大人脸上打了一巴掌。已经发表的一部分文件，就足以证明麦克米伦对美国外交政策的影响是多么可怜。如果真把“每一份电报和每一次交谈情况都发表出来”，那末英国首相显然更要丑相毕露了。
    过时的梦
    据“华盛顿邮报”透露，法国的一些将军建议对突尼斯发动全面的闪电战。他们甚至提出了保证：在三天内一定能够占领突尼斯全国。
    看来，这些狂妄的将军们由于对早已过时的“炮舰外交”迷恋过深，以致于完全忘记了自己是生活在什么时代了。他们曾经和英国的伙伴一起对埃及发动过一场“闪电战”，结果遭到了可耻的失败。他们还曾经夸口要在三个月甚至更短的时间内肃清阿尔及利亚的“叛乱”，结果这场战争延续了三年多，而他们自己的处境越来越不利。可是，这些事实的教训，并没有使得他们变得更聪明一些。
    奉劝这些法国将军，还是清醒一些吧！沉溺在殖民时代的旧梦中，认为挥舞军刀就可以解决一切问题，这在现实生活中是必然会碰得头破血流的。
