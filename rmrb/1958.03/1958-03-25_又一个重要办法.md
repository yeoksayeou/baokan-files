    Another Important Method

    The new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture has created a new contradiction: large production tasks and insufficient labor. This contradiction has become prominently apparent during the spring plowing. Many places are mobilizing the masses to create and improve tools, which is an important method to resolve this contradiction. Today, this newspaper publishes a news item introducing the experience of some agricultural cooperatives in Hanshou and Liuyang counties, Hunan Province, in improving labor organization and strengthening labor management, which has doubled work efficiency. This is another important method to resolve the contradiction.

    People are the most active and revolutionary factor in the productive forces. In order to promote the development of productive forces, we must not only improve production tools but also improve labor organization and fully utilize people's subjective initiative. The practices of Hanshou and Liuyang are worth learning from in all regions. If all regions pay attention to solving the difficulty of insufficient labor from these two aspects, it will inevitably greatly promote the high tide of spring plowing and even the situation of the Great Leap Forward throughout the year.

    又一个重要办法
    农业大跃进的新形势产生了一个新矛盾：生产任务大，劳动力不足。这个矛盾在春耕中已突出地显示出来了。许多地方正在发动群众创造和改进工具，这是解决矛盾的一个重要办法。今天本报登载的一条新闻，介绍了湖南汉寿、浏阳两县有些农业社改善劳动组织，加强劳动管理，工效提高一倍的经验，是解决矛盾的又一个重要办法。
    人是生产力中最活跃最革命的要素。为了促进生产力的发展，必须既要改进生产工具，又要改进劳动组织，充分发挥人的主观能动性。汉寿、浏阳的做法，值得各地学习。如果各地都注意从这两方面来解决劳动力不足的困难，就必然会大大促进春耕高潮以至全年大跃进的形势。
