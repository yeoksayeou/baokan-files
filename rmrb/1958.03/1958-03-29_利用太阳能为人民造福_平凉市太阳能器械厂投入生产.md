    Using Solar Energy to Benefit the People
    Pingliang City Solar Energy Equipment Factory Goes into Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 28th: A solar energy equipment factory in Pingliang City, Gansu Province, went into production on the 26th, and has already manufactured its first batch of solar cookers and solar water boilers. On that day, nearly a thousand visitors drank boiling water heated by solar energy.
    This factory was jointly established by the Pingliang City Carpentry and Sheet Metal Handicraft Cooperative through fundraising. Its main products are solar cookers, solar water heaters, and solar water boilers. These devices are easy to operate and understand with a simple explanation, and can be used by placing them in the sunlight and facing the sun. The solar cooker can hold seven jin of water, and at the current temperature, the water can be boiled in twenty-five minutes, and it can also be used to cook rice. The solar water heater can hold forty-two jin of water and heats up in three and a half hours. The solar water boiler holds thirty-two jin of water and boils in three hours. With such equipment, an ordinary family can use it to boil water or cook rice. Currently, the Pingliang Special District has formulated a plan to promote it widely.
    This factory emerged in the context of the current large-scale development of local industry in Gansu Province. Yesterday, the "Gansu Daily" published this news on the front page with a headline and also published an editorial entitled "Using Solar Energy to Benefit the People." The editorial stated that rural areas in Gansu Province lack fuel, and cooking and boiling water mostly use straw, weeds, and animal dung as fuel. Straw is good fodder, animal dung is good fertilizer, and weeds can be used to feed livestock and also to make green manure. It is a pity to burn them as firewood. In the future, with the improvement of rural hygiene, everyone will drink boiled water, and farmers will also need to bathe frequently, and the fuel problem will become even more prominent. Using solar cookers, solar bathhouses and other equipment can save a lot of fuel and relatively increase fodder and fertilizer.

### 利用太阳能为人民造福  平凉市太阳能器械厂投入生产

    利用太阳能为人民造福
    平凉市太阳能器械厂投入生产
    新华社兰州28日电　甘肃省平凉市一个太阳能器械厂26日投入生产，并且已制造出第一批太阳能灶和太阳能沸水器等器械。这一天，有近千个参观者喝到了利用太阳能烧的开水。
    这个厂是平凉市木器和黑白铁手工业社筹资合办的。它的主要产品有太阳能灶、太阳能热水器、太阳能沸水器三种。这些器械操作方便，一说就懂，放在阳光下对住太阳即可使用。太阳能灶可容水七市斤，按当前的气温，过二十五分钟水就可以煮沸，并且可以用来煮饭。太阳能热水器可容水四十二市斤，三小时半就热。太阳能沸水器容水三十二市斤，三小时便开。有了这样的器械，一个普通家庭就可以利用它烧水或煮饭。目前平凉专区已订出规划，决定普遍推广。
    这个厂是在目前甘肃省地方工业大发展的情况下出现的。昨天“甘肃日报”以头版头条刊登了这条新闻，并且发表了“利用太阳能为人民造福”的社论。社论说，甘肃省农村燃料较缺乏，做饭、烧水多用秸秆、野草和畜粪等作燃料；秸秆是良好的饲料，畜粪是良好肥料，野草既可饲牲畜，又可沤绿肥，当柴烧了，岂不可惜？今后农村卫生水平提高，人人喝开水，农民们也要经常洗澡，燃料问题还会更加突出。应用太阳能灶、太阳能浴室等设备，就可以节约大量的燃料，相对地增加了饲料、肥料。
