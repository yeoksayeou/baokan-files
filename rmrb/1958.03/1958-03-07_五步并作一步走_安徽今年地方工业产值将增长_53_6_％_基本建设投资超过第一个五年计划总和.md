    Hefei, March 6th (by our newspaper) - Anhui Province recently formulated an accelerated plan for local industry this year, aiming to "take five steps as one." According to this plan, the total output value of Anhui's local industries will increase from the original 1.24 billion yuan to 1.92 billion yuan this year, an increase of 53.6% over the original output value. This increase is equivalent to 92% of the five-year growth during the First Five-Year Plan period. This year's investment in basic construction for local industries will exceed the total investment of the previous five years by more than 44%. This year, 1,363 industrial projects will commence construction throughout the province. After the implementation of this plan, the output value of Anhui's local industries will increase from the original 25% of the total industrial and agricultural output value to 31%.

    The development plan for Anhui's local industries this year differs from the past: in the past, plans were formulated based on average quotas; this time, advanced quotas are used as the standard, requiring those lagging behind to catch up with the advanced through effort. This is a plan that encourages people to make a great leap forward. This year's basic construction plan has changed the past situation of simply limiting the development of rural small-scale industries for the sake of the development of light industry in large cities. Factories are being built in raw material production areas and product sales areas, so that industry can better serve agriculture.

    The broad masses of workers and staff in Anhui Province are working hard to realize this great leap forward plan and change the backward state of Anhui's industry. Workers and staff in thirty-eight factories in Hefei City are determined to increase industrial output value by more than 66% this year compared to last year. According to the original quotas, it would be necessary to increase personnel to complete such a plan. However, the workers and staff of these factories decided to break with convention, adopt advanced quotas, and reduce effective working hours to complete the plan. Workers and staff at the Mining Machinery Factory reduced effective working hours by 240,000, accounting for 21% of the factory's total effective working hours for the year, equivalent to adding 100 workers. The workers and staff of the First Textile Factory have universally launched a competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced. Spinner Zang Yongzhen and Han Cuiying have each been watching 1,200 and 1,400 spindles respectively, and are striving towards 1,600 spindles.

    五步并作一步走
    安徽今年地方工业产值将增长53.6％
    基本建设投资超过第一个五年计划总和
    本报合肥6日电　安徽省最近制定了今年地方工业“五步并作一步走”的跃进计划。按照这一计划，安徽地方工业的总产值，今年将由原来的十二亿四千多万元增长到十九亿二千万元，比原有产值增长53.6％。这一增长额等于第一个五年计划期间五年增长额的92％。今年地方工业的基本建设投资额，比前五年投资的总和还超过44％以上。今年，全省将有一千三百六十三个工业项目动工建设。这一计划实现以后，将使安徽地方工业的产值，由原来占工农业总产值25％提高到占31％。
    今年安徽地方工业的发展计划，和过去不同的是：过去是以平均定额制定计划，这次是以先进定额为标准，要求落后赶先进，经过努力才可以完成。这是鼓舞人们大跃进的计划。今年的基本建设计划中，改变了过去单纯为了大城市轻工业的发展而限制农村小工业发展的情况，把工厂建设在原料产地和产品销地，这样就使工业能够更好地为农业服务。
    安徽省广大职工，正为实现这一大跃进计划，改变安徽工业落后的状况而努力。合肥市有三十八个工厂的职工，今年决心要把工业产值比去年提高66％以上。按照原有定额，必须增加人员才能完成这样的计划，这些厂的职工却决定打破常规，采用先进定额，压缩有效工时，这样来完成计划。矿山机器厂职工压缩有效工时二十四万个，占全年全厂有效工时的21％，相当于增加一百个工人。第一纺织厂的职工普遍开展了学先进、赶先进的竞赛，挡车工臧永珍、韩翠英分别看到一千二百和一千四百个纱锭，正向着一千六百个纱锭奋斗。
