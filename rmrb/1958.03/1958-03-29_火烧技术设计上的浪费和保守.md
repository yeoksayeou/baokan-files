“Designing a line can cost thousands of gold pieces.” This saying reflects the significant influence that design personnel have in our national construction endeavors. Once the state's investment and production plans are determined, whether a factory is built, civil construction is undertaken, or a new product is trialed and an old product improved, the primary determining factor for whether it is wasteful or economical, advanced or conservative, lies in the design personnel's designs. Advanced design thinking will accelerate the progress of construction, while backward design thinking will cause serious waste. Therefore, opposing waste and conservatism in design and improving the quality and level of design is a crucial issue that all design departments must resolve during the rectification campaign. Without resolving this issue, the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" cannot be fully implemented.

Now, the flames of anti-waste and anti-conservatism are burning towards the technical design departments. Wherever there has been extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and major debates, a new atmosphere of great leaps forward has begun to emerge. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the Ministry of Chemical Industry re-examined and revised the design of factory buildings. According to the original design, a contact sulfuric acid plant with an annual output of 80,000 tons required an investment of 8.2 million yuan, but now it only needs 5 million yuan. This design modification means that the investment originally planned for building thirty plants can now be used to build fifty plants, and the sulfuric acid output will increase from the original 2.4 million tons to 4 million tons. This is one example of a great leap forward in factory design. The Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau Design Institute, since opposing design waste and conservatism, has inspected one hundred and thirty design projects, modified five hundred and fifty drawings, and saved the state more than 9 million yuan. This is one example of a great leap forward in civil construction design. The boiler-locomotive produced by the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory weighs 90 kilograms per horsepower, which is 70 kilograms heavier than the most advanced gas engine. After research by the design personnel, they are preparing to reduce it to 23 kilograms. This is one example of a great leap forward in the design of mechanical products. These facts reflect that waste in design is the biggest waste, and savings in design are also the biggest savings. If the waste hidden in design work is not eliminated, even if the construction and production departments exert their best efforts, it will be difficult to compensate for the losses caused by design. The saying "a miss is as good as a mile" is the best warning for design personnel.

In order to implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and to eliminate various wasteful phenomena in design, we must resolutely struggle against various backward ideas. For a long time, the emphasis on safety factors and adherence to convention in design work has been very serious. In order to be safe everywhere, they adopt various methods to increase the safety factor, setting up defenses at all levels and deploying them in depth. Anything that can be either large or small is always better to be a little larger; anything that may or may not be needed is always better to have than not to have; anything that can be either thick or thin is always better to be a little thicker. They only see that having a safety factor guarantees their work, but they do not understand that an excessively large safety factor is actually a reflection of waste and conservatism.

Of course, viewed in isolation from the safety factor and the guarantee conditions, as a technical designer, they have a conscience. However, their conscience is a "technical conscience," a conscience that is responsible for their personal technical reputation, not a conscience that is responsible for the state's assets. Because of this, they consider their personal technical responsibilities more when doing technical design, while considering the state's economic capabilities and level very little. The things they design are mostly real-life surveys and adherence to convention, and few are bold creations and bold innovations. They are afraid of future accidents and accountability, preferring to increase the safety factor rather than reduce it; some even include situations hundreds of years later in the insurance project. This wastes the state's assets and hinders the development of the profession.

Another backward idea in design work is the idea of a personal "masterpiece." This idea is most prominent in architectural design departments. Some architectural designers, in order to pursue personal masterpieces and erect personal monuments, put their personal desires above everything else and put the state's construction policy behind them. Our country's principles for architecture are: suitability, economy, and attention to aesthetics where possible. The so-called suitability means that it must be suitable for the needs of production and work; the so-called economy means that it must be adapted to the current national manpower, financial resources, and the level of people's lives; the so-called aesthetics means that it should meet the requirements of aesthetics as much as possible under the principle of following suitability and economy (except for certain special buildings that need to meet artistic requirements, of course). Being aesthetically pleasing but not suitable or economical means sacrificing the main interests for the sake of secondary interests. However, some design personnel still have great ideological resistance to the country's architectural principles. They believe that construction must be aesthetically pleasing, and that aesthetics require spending money. They believe that good buildings have only two standards: one is a high standard, and the other is a large area. They cover up all the wasteful phenomena in design with "method issues" and "style issues." However, in essence, these are just excuses for bourgeois individualism to waste state assets. We cannot tolerate such heartless and sinful acts of wasting the people's blood and sweat. In capitalist society, what the bourgeoisie appreciates is competing in luxury, extravagance, style, and personal technical conscience, reputation, and status. In socialist society, there is another standard, which is to compete in achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and in economic suitability. Therefore, the struggle against waste and conservatism in the design department cannot but be a sharp struggle between proletarian design thinking and bourgeois design thinking. Avoiding this ideological struggle will not solve the problem fundamentally.

In recent years, especially after the emphasis on opposing waste in construction in 1953, the struggle between the two ideologies among design personnel has been ongoing. However, the phenomenon of avoiding ideological struggle still exists. They believe that technical issues are scientific issues and have their own particularities, which cannot be solved by the general mass line. Therefore, they doubt whether democracy is needed on technical issues. In this rectification campaign, the broad masses have exposed a large number of unreasonable phenomena and broken through the defense line of technical mystery. Experience has proven that whether or not the mass line can be followed in technical design is the key to the advance or retreat of technical design thinking. The era of unique and exclusive technical design has passed. The present era is the era in which the people demand to build socialism in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. In order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, it is necessary to combine technical advancement with economic rationality. This is not simpler but more complex and arduous for design work. This requires using collective strength and collective wisdom, conscientiously summarizing past work experience, being good at examining and studying the technical and economic policies of capital construction based on China's specific conditions, as well as various standards, norms, and quotas, and implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in building the country, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in various engineering designs. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, many design departments have been able to achieve economic and political harvests because they have let go and promoted democracy and implemented the mass line. Without the mass line, it is unimaginable to have such a great leap forward in thought and work.

This year, people from all fronts across the country are advancing with the force of a thunderbolt, and the requirements for design work from all aspects are very high. Therefore, the task of design work is particularly heavy. Existing design drawings need to be re-modified and drawn, and new design tasks also need to be accelerated to completion. Under these circumstances, in order to make design work keep up with the situation of the Great Leap Forward, it is necessary to organically link anti-waste and anti-conservatism with ideological transformation and technical improvement, to carefully calculate accounts economically and oppose conservatism technically, in order to achieve the goal of improving quality and improving work.

Calculating accounts economically is not a trivial matter, but a major event related to policy and ideology. Because to calculate economic accounts, we must calculate the accounts of diligence and thrift in building the country, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, which are the accounts of policies and guidelines, and the accounts of politics and ideology. Calculating ideological accounts without actual economic issues is bound to be empty and superficial, without any basis. Calculating economic accounts without policy guidelines and political ideology, it will be difficult to calculate this account clearly and well. In order to calculate this account well, you may wish to convene people from various aspects to participate in the discussion, so as to fully expose contradictions from various angles and aspects, and boldly affirm advanced things and reject backward things. In this way, the problems originally raised from the economic field will be further deepened into the political and technical fields, and will be improved politically and technically.

Carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in technical design departments is a profound revolution in the technical thinking of technical personnel. We hope that all design personnel who are willing to progress will bravely devote themselves to the fiery revolutionary struggle, exercise themselves, improve themselves, and make due efforts for the great leap forward in production and the great leap forward in culture.

### 火烧技术设计上的浪费和保守

    火烧技术设计上的浪费和保守
    “设计一条线，落笔千万金”。这句话反映设计人员在我们国家建设事业中有着重要的影响。当国家投资计划和生产计划确定以后，不论工厂建设、民用建筑或者新产品试制和老产品改进，究竟是浪费还是节约，是先进还是保守，首要一关就决定于设计人员的设计了。先进的设计思想会加速建设事业的前进，而落后的设计思想就会造成严重的浪费。所以，反对设计中的浪费和保守，提高设计的质量和水平，是所有设计部门在整风中必须解决的一个关键问题，不解决这个问题，多、快、好、省的建设方针，就得不到全面的贯彻。
    现在，反浪费、反保守的火焰正烧向技术设计部门，凡是经过大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的地方，已经开始出现大跃进的新气象。化工部在反浪费、反保守运动中，重新审查和修改了厂房设计，一个年产八万吨接触法硫酸厂，根据原来的设计，需要投资八百二十万元，现在只需五百万元就够了。这一设计的修改，原来准备兴建三十个厂的投资，现在可以兴建五十个厂，硫酸产量由原来的二百四十万吨增加到四百万吨，这是工厂设计大跃进的事例之一。北京市规划局设计院，从反对设计浪费和保守以来，检查了一百三十项设计工项，修改了五百五十张图纸，为国家节省资金九百多万元，这是民用建筑设计大跃进的事例之一。石家庄动力机械厂生产的锅驼机，每马力九十公斤，跟最先进的煤气机比起来重量要大七十公斤，经过设计人员的研究，准备降到二十三公斤，这是机械产品设计中大跃进的事例之一。这些事实，反映设计中的浪费是最大的浪费，设计中的节约也就是最大的节约。如果设计工作中隐藏着浪费不扫除，即便施工部门、生产部门尽了最大的力量，也难弥补设计上所造成的损失。所谓“差之毫厘、失之千里”，对设计人员来说，是最好不过的警语。
    为了贯彻多快好省的方针，扫除设计中的各种浪费现象，必须坚决地同各种落后思想作斗争。长期以来，设计工作中强调保险系数和墨守陈规的思想是十分严重的。他们为了处处保险，就采用各种办法加大保险系数，层层设防，纵深配备。凡是可大可小的东西，总是大一点好；可有可无的东西，总是有比没有好；可厚可薄的东西，总是厚一点好。他们只看到，有了保险系数在工作上才有保证，而没有了解过大的保险系数，实际上就是浪费和保守的反映。
    当然，孤立地从保险系数和保证条件来看，作为一个技术设计人员，他们是有良心的，不过，他们的良心是“技术良心”，是对个人技术名誉负责的良心，不是对国家资财负责的良心。正因为这样，他们在技术设计的时候，考虑个人技术责任多，而考虑国家经济能力和水平却很少。他们设计出来的东西，属于实样测绘、墨守陈规的多，属于大胆创造、大胆革新的少。他们唯恐将来发生什么事故，追查责任，宁愿加大保险系数，不愿减少保险系数；有的人甚至连几百年以后的情况也列入保险项目。这就浪费了国家资财，妨碍了专业的发展。
    设计工作中另一种落后思想是个人“杰作”思想。这种思想在建筑设计部门最为突出，有些建筑设计人员为了追求个人杰作，树立个人纪念碑，个人欲望压倒一切，把国家建设方针置诸脑后。我们国家对建筑的原则是：适用、经济，并在可能条件下注意美观。所谓适用，就是要适合于生产和工作的需要；所谓经济，就是要适应当前国家人力财力和人民生活的水平；所谓美观，是要在服从适用、经济的原则下尽可能达到美观的要求（至于某些需要满足艺术要求的特殊建筑当然例外）。美观而不适用又不经济，就是为了次要的利益而牺牲了主要的利益。可是，有些设计人员到现在为止，对于国家的建筑原则，在思想上还有很大的抵触。他们认为要建筑就得要美观，要美观就得要花钱。他们认为好的建筑只有两个标准：一个是标准高，一个是面积大。他们把设计中的浪费现象统统用“手法问题”、“风格问题”掩盖起来。然而就其实质来说，这些正是资产阶级个人主义浪费国家资财的借口。我们不能容许这样无心肝地浪费人民血汗的罪恶行为。在资本主义社会里，资产阶级所欣赏的就是比豪华、比阔气、比风格、比个人技术良心、名誉地位。在社会主义社会里则是另一个标准，这就是要比多快好省，比经济适用。因此，反浪费、反保守的斗争，在设计部门中，不能不是一场无产阶级设计思想和资产阶级设计思想的尖锐斗争。回避这种思想斗争，就不能从根本上解决问题。
    这些年来，特别是1953年着重反对建筑中的浪费以后，设计人员中的两种思想斗争一直在进行着。然而，回避思想斗争的现象却仍然存在。他们认为技术问题是科学问题，有它的特殊性，不是一般的群众路线所解决得了的。因此，他们对于在技术问题上要不要民主表示怀疑。在这次整风中，广大群众揭发大批不合理的现象，突破了技术神秘的防线。经验证明：技术设计上能否走群众路线，是技术设计思想前进或倒退的关键。技术设计上独树一帜、唯我独尊的时代已经过去了。现在的时代是人民群众要求多快好省地建设社会主义的时代。为了做到又多又快又好又省，必须把技术上的先进性同经济上的合理性结合起来。这一点，对设计工作来说，不是更简单，而是更复杂、更艰巨了。这就需要运用集体力量和集体智慧，认真地总结过去的工作经验，善于从我国具体情况出发，检查和研究基本建设的技术经济政策，以及各种标准规范和定额，从各种工程设计中贯彻执行勤俭建国、多快好省的方针。在反浪费、反保守运动中，许多设计部门所以能够取得经济上和政治上的丰收，就是放手发扬民主、贯彻群众路线的结果。离开了群众路线，要想在思想上、工作上有这样大的跃进，是不可想像的。
    今年，全国各个战线上的人们正在以雷霆万钧之势奔腾前进，各方面对设计工作的要求很高，因而设计工作任务也显得特别繁重。原有的设计图纸，需要重新修改和绘制，新的设计任务也需要加紧完成。在这种情况下，要使设计工作赶上大跃进的形势，必须把反浪费、反保守和改造思想、改进技术有机地衔接起来，从经济上算细账、从技术上反保守，达到提高质量、改进工作的目的。
    从经济上算账，并不是一件小事，而是关系到政策思想的大事。因为要算经济账，势必要算到勤俭建国、多快好省的账，也就是政策方针的账，是政治的账和思想的账。离开实际经济问题来算思想账，必然空虚浮浅，无所依据。离开了政策方针和政治思想来算经济账，这笔账也难算清算好。为了算好这笔账，不妨召集多方面的人参加讨论，以便从各个角度、各个方面充分揭露矛盾，大胆肯定先进的东西、排斥落后的东西。这样，原来从经济领域里提出来的问题，就会进一步深入到政治领域和技术领域去，就会在政治上、技术上有所提高。
    在技术设计部门开展反浪费、反保守运动，是技术人员在技术思想上一次深刻的革命。我们希望一切愿意进步的设计人员勇敢地投入到火热的革命斗争中去，锻炼自己、提高自己，为生产大跃进、文化大跃进作出应有的努力。
