Comrade Xu Lao Discusses Part-Work and Study
By our reporter Bai Sheng

Part-work and study is an excellent revolutionary tradition of Chinese youth. Forty years ago, about a thousand young Chinese went to France for part-work and study, working in French factories while pursuing their education. Comrade Xu Terli was one of those students who went to France for part-work and study. Later, this group of young students produced many outstanding leaders of the Party and the country, such as Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, and Li Fuchun.

In a simple and bright courtyard in Beijing, I recently had the opportunity to visit the veteran revolutionary Comrade Xu Terli. Comrade Xu is already eighty-one years old this year, with completely white hair, but he still diligently works and studies every day. He walks as vigorously as ever, is full of energy, and is very talkative. His life is so frugal; in the difficult years of the revolution, his clothes, shoes, and socks were all sewn and mended by himself. He still maintains this style of hard work and frugality today. He was wearing an old cotton uniform, covered with a faded and re-dyed blue cloth coat, and warmly received the reporter in his small living room.

In 1919, when Comrade Xu first went to France for part-work and study, he was already forty-two years old. At that time, he had been a teacher and principal in primary and secondary schools and higher normal schools in Hunan for twenty years, and had also served as the deputy speaker of the Hunan Provincial Assembly, enjoying a high reputation and status in the educational circles of Hunan. At that time, he was the oldest of the students studying in France. His spirit of seeking knowledge was widely admired in educational circles and among overseas students.

After arriving in France, Comrade Xu entered the Moulins Provincial Public School in France with the young students to learn French and live the collective life of ordinary students. He also audited mathematics at the University of Paris, cooked for the students studying in France for part-work and study, and worked as a fitter in a French factory. Comrade Li Zhuoran wrote these two lines in a poem congratulating Comrade Xu on his seventieth birthday:

　　"At forty-five or six, learning the fitter's bench,
　　Competing with peers in pottery, steel, chisels, and iron."

Comrade Li Zhuoran said in the annotation to this poem: In 1922, I met Comrade Xu at the Saint-Chamond Steel Plant in southern France, where he competed with us young fellows in learning to be a fitter, and was often unwilling to admit defeat. From this, we can see the situation of Comrade Xu's part-work and study in France at that time.

With a feeling of admiration, I listened to Comrade Xu's memories of his life in France for part-work and study. Comrade Xu believes that the greatest gain from that period of life was the understanding of capitalist society, which increased his perceptual knowledge of capitalist society and saw through the "peep show" of capitalist society. Comrade Xu said, "At that time, we worked in factories and had many personal experiences. We gained a lot of social knowledge, and I understood what the capitalist exploitation system was all about. Capitalists do not relax the time workers spend working in factories, not for a minute or a second, they try every means to exploit workers. At that time, in some large factories in France, workers were not only exploited by the big capitalists when they worked, but also had to buy daily necessities from them and be exploited by them. The lives of all laborers in the factory were completely controlled by the capitalists. If you go on strike, they will find ways to make your life immediately problematic."

Speaking of this, Comrade Xu recalled with infinite emotion: "The conditions in which we worked in the factory at that time were of course very bad, and cannot be compared with the factories in our country now. At that time, workers had no political status at all, and workers' lives were not guaranteed. And it was in such an environment that students who went to France for part-work and study had to work hard to study on their own after finishing their work during the day!"

Comrade Xu became very angry when he talked about the relationship between people in capitalist society. He said that in his few years in France, he not only understood the exploitative relations of capitalist society, but also understood what the so-called freedom and the relationship between people in France were. He said: "The so-called freedom in capitalist society is very cruel and inhumane, and in fact it is the most unfree. Everything is based on money. Male-female relationships, family relationships, everything is controlled by money and property. For example, some people's own mothers work as nannies for others, but their own children have to hire nannies. This phenomenon is very common. A person without money is equivalent to having no personality."

Comrade Xu then talked about many extremely profound opinions on the part-work and study that we are advocating today. He first talked about this issue from the perspective of historical development. He said: "As long as mankind exists, diligence and thrift will exist; at present, in socialist society, we must be diligent and thrifty. We cannot only consume, we must always leave a part for expanded reproduction. The more we leave, the faster the society develops. Accumulation is for future development."

Comrade Xu said, "Part-work and study is needed in any era. Solely using the mind will lead to idealism. Combining mental and physical labor is materialism. Today, mental and physical labor must not be separated. To have a high degree of wisdom and improve work efficiency, we must constantly use our hands. Physical labor is the foundation, the source of wisdom. People get wisdom from labor, and then use their brains to command their hands, so labor will be better. It is not good for people not to use their hands, they must develop both hands and brains at the same time; it is also not good for people not to use their brains, there is absolutely no blind and unplanned activity. Without physical labor, mental labor has no foundation; without mental labor, physical labor cannot advance."

In the past, the exploiting class, in order to maintain its ability to exploit and oppress the people forever and hinder the development of society, advocated that those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their hands are governed by others, so that mental and physical labor were separated. Today is the era of the people. We want to build, transform society, transform nature, conquer space and the ocean, and develop forever and continuously. We must advocate the combination of mental and physical labor, which is why we are advocating part-work and study today.

Comrade Xu became more and more excited as he spoke. He said that there is an old saying in China, "Study enough for three excesses." That is to say, the evening is the excess time of the day, the rain and snow are the excess time of sunny days, and winter is the excess time of the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn. People usually work on weekdays, and only read books when they have extra time; in ancient times, people did not only study without working for a year, a day, or a season. They worked during the day and read at night, worked on sunny days and read on rainy days, worked in the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn, and read in winter.

Comrade Xu said that our understanding of the significance of part-work and study now must not only stay at the significance of the era of part-work and study in France. The significance of part-work and study now has become much deeper and broader than it was at that time. At the same time, our implementation of part-work and study now should not only be regarded as during the student era, but a person's life should be a process of part-work and study. A person should be cultivated to be able to use their brain and hands from childhood. Speaking of this, Comrade Xu seemed very excited. He said: "Today we are in the era of the socialist Great Leap Forward, all our work is leaping forward, and our practical knowledge and book knowledge have not kept up with the needs of our work. How can this be allowed? Today, not only young people must engage in part-work and study, but we all must engage in part-work and study."

Comrade Xu emphasized that today we are advocating part-work and study, which is precisely the issue of reforming education, and it is combined with diligence and frugality in running schools. School leaders, teachers, and students must be diligent and frugal in running schools and engage in part-work and study. In the past, Comrade Xu himself started schools by mobilizing teachers and students to run schools in a revolutionary way. He founded several schools in Changsha, Hunan, from scratch. When the Changsha Women's Normal School was founded, the school buildings were borrowed, the school equipment was borrowed, and the start-up funds were borrowed. Comrade Xu used the spirit of diligence and frugality in running schools, himself serving as principal, teacher, and worker. In addition to teaching classes every day, he had to personally ring the bell and sweep the floor. Comrade Xu also ran schools in the Jiangxi Soviet Area in this way, personally ringing the bell, sweeping the floor, growing vegetables, and cooking food, living the same hard life as the students. Comrade Xu said that today's leaders must be models, and what they want young people to do, leaders must first do themselves. He also talked about another important significance of part-work and study in reforming education, which is to change the teaching method of theory being divorced from practice. Book knowledge must be learned, but the knowledge in practice is much richer than the knowledge in books. Teaching must be combined with practice, combined with production and struggle, otherwise it will become dogmatism.

Comrade Xu also repeatedly pointed out profoundly that today our society is constantly progressing, and human knowledge is also constantly increasing. A person's knowledge is given to you by society, given to you by predecessors. If intellectuals want to move forward, they must give more knowledge to the next generation, and should not get more and give less. One generation should contribute more than the previous generation. Our knowledge is for the collective, not for the individual. We are socialist, and we cannot only take care of the individual, so that society can continue to move forward.

The visit was coming to an end, and Comrade Xu said kindly, "Young people see such a great society and such a bright future today, won't they strive to move forward happily! Young people must create, must be revolutionary, and must live vigorously. Don't sigh when you fail. We have a saying in Hunan, 'Don't look back at the broken urn.' This sentence means don't be negative when you fail, but learn from the failure and strive for victory in the future."

When I came out of Comrade Xu's house, it was already dark. Facing the light cool evening breeze of early spring, I silently walked out of the alley, while recalling Comrade Xu's enthusiastic and profound conversation just now. Isn't the life of Comrade Xu, who is eighty-one years old, the best example of part-work and study? What could be more sufficient to explain the great political significance of part-work and study for educated youth? I feel very happy. This visit, I myself first had a profound and vivid political lesson on part-work and study.

    徐老谈勤工俭学
    本报记者　柏生
    勤工俭学是我国青年学生的优良的革命传统。四十年前我国约有一千多个青年留法勤工俭学，他们一方面在法国工厂里做工，一方面求学。徐特立同志就是那时到法国做勤工俭学学生的。在这批青年学生里后来还产生了像周恩来、邓小平、陈毅、聂荣臻、李富春等党的和国家的许多优秀的领导同志。
    在北京一个普通的明静的院里，记者最近有机会访问了这位革命老前辈徐特立同志。徐老今年已经八十一岁了，须发全白，但他每日仍孜孜不倦地勤于工作，勤于学习，他走起路来还是那么健壮，精神矍铄，也非常健谈。他的生活是那样俭朴，在革命的艰苦年代里，他的衣服、鞋袜都是自己缝补。他的这种艰苦俭朴的作风，今天一直还是保持着的。他穿着一身旧棉制服，外面罩着已经褪了色又重新染过的蓝布罩衣，在他的小小的客厅里热情地接待了记者。
    1919年徐老初到法国勤工俭学的那一年他已经四十二岁了。那时他在湖南已经当了二十年的中小学、高等师范的教员和校长，还曾经担任过湖南省议会的副议长，在湖南的教育界里有很高的声誉和地位。当时他是留法学生中年纪最大的一个。他的这种求学精神，在教育界和留学生中间，传为美谈。
    徐老到法国以后，和青年学生一块进了法国木兰省立公学学法文，过一般学生的集体生活。他还在巴黎大学旁听过数学，给留法勤工俭学学生烧过饭，进法国工厂做过钳工。李卓然同志在祝徐老七十大寿的诗里有这样两句话：
    “四十五六学钳床，
      陶钢凿铁赛同行。”
    李卓然同志在这首诗的附注里说：1922年遇徐老于法国南部圣侠门钢铁厂，他与我辈青年小伙子赛学钳工，常不服输。从这里我们可以看到徐老当时在法国勤工俭学的情况。
    怀着敬仰的心情，我倾听着徐老对留法勤工俭学那段生活的回忆。徐老认为那段生活给他收获最大的是对资本主义社会的认识，增加了对资本主义社会的感性知识，也看穿了资本主义社会的西洋镜。徐老说，我们那时在工厂里做工，有了许多亲身的体验，得到了许多社会知识，我懂得了资本主义的剥削制度是怎么一回事。资本家不放松工人在工厂里做工的时间，一分一秒钟，他们都千方百计地想办法剥削工人。当时在法国的一些大工厂里，工人不但在做工的时候受着大资本家的剥削，在日用消费品方面，也要向他们购买，受他们剥削。所有工厂中的劳动者的生活，完全是由资本家在支配。你罢工，他们就设法使你生活马上成问题。
    谈到这里，徐老无限感慨地回忆说：那时我们在工厂里作工的条件当然很不好，根本不能和现在我们国家的工厂相比。那时工人根本没有政治地位，工人生活没有保障。而就是在那样的环境下，留法勤工俭学学生白天做完工，晚上还要抓紧刻苦自学呢！
    徐老对资本主义社会人与人的关系，一谈起来就非常气愤。他说，他在法国几年，不仅了解了资本主义社会的剥削关系，也了解了法国所谓的自由，和人与人的关系是什么东西。他说：资本主义社会所谓自由是非常残酷无人道的，其实也是最不自由的。一切都是建立在金钱上。男女关系，家庭关系，一切都被金钱财产所掌握，例如有的人自己的母亲去给别人做保姆，可是自己家里的儿女还要雇请保姆。这种现象很多，一个人没有钱，就等于没有人格。
    徐老进而对我们今天所提倡的勤工俭学，谈了许多极其深刻的意见。他首先从历史的发展上谈起这个问题，他说：人类存在，勤俭就存在；目前，在社会主义社会，我们必须勤俭，不能只消费，总要留一部分扩大再生产，越留得多，社会发展得越快，积累是为了将来的发展。
    徐老说，勤工俭学是任何时代都需要的。单只劳心，就会变为唯心主义，劳心和劳力结合起来就是唯物主义了。今天劳心劳力绝不能分开，要有高度的智慧，要提高工作效能，就要不断动手。劳力是基础，是智慧的来源，人从劳动中得到了智慧，再用脑指挥手，劳动就更好。人不动手是不行的，一定要一面动手，一面动脑，手脑并行发展；人不动脑也不行，绝没有盲目的无计划的活动。不劳力，劳心就没有基础；不劳心，劳力就不能前进。
    过去剥削阶级为了保持它能够永远剥削压迫人民，阻碍社会的发展，就提倡劳心者治人，劳力者治于人，使劳心和劳力脱节。今天是人民的时代，我们要建设，要改造社会，改造大自然，征服空间和海洋，要永远不断地向前发展，我们就要提倡劳心劳力结合，这也就是我们今天为什么要提倡勤工俭学的道理。
    徐老越谈越兴奋，他说，中国古来就有“学足三余”这样一句话。那就是说，晚上是一日中多余的时候，落雨落雪是天晴多余的时候，冬季是春夏秋三季多余的时候，平日都要做工，只有得闲多余的时候才读书；古时候人没有一年一日一季专读书不作工的，日中作工，晚上读书，天晴作工，落雨读书，春夏秋三季作工，冬季读书。
    徐老说，现在我们理解勤工俭学的意义就绝不能只停留在留法勤工俭学时代的意义上了，现在勤工俭学的意义已经比那时变化得深广多了。同时，现在我们实行勤工俭学，也不应仅认为是在做学生的时代，人的一生都应该是勤工俭学的过程。一个人从小孩子开始，就应该培养他会动脑动手。谈到这里，徐老显得十分激动，他说：今天我们处在社会主义大跃进的时代，我们的一切工作都在跃进，我们的实际知识和书本知识都已经赶不上工作的需要了，这如何得了。今天不光是青年人要勤工俭学，我们大家都要勤工俭学。
    徐老着重谈到，今天我们提倡勤工俭学，正是革新教育的问题，它和勤俭办学是结合起来的。学校的领导人、教师、学生都要做到勤俭办学、勤工俭学。徐老过去自己办学时就是发动教师、学生一起革命办学。他在湖南长沙，白手起家地创办了好几所学校，像长沙女子师范学校创办时，校舍是借来的，校具也是借来的，开办费也是借来的。徐老就是这样用勤俭办学的精神，自己一身兼任校长、教员和工人，他每天忙于教课以外，还要亲自摇铃、扫地。徐老后来在江西苏区办学也是这样的，亲自摇铃、扫地、种菜、弄饭吃，和学生过同样的艰苦生活。徐老说，今天的领导者要做模范，要青年做什么，领导者首先要自己去做。他还谈到，勤工俭学在革新教育方面的另一重大意义，就是改变理论脱离实际的教学方法。书本知识要学，但实际中的知识比书本的知识要丰富得多，教学一定要和实际结合起来，要和生产和斗争结合起来，不然就成为教条主义的了。
    徐老还一再深刻的指出，今天我们的社会在不断地进步，人类的知识也不断地在增加，一个人的知识是社会给你的，是前人给你的，知识分子要前进，就要付给下一代更多的知识，不应该自己得的多付出的少。应该一代贡献超过一代。我们的知识是为集体的，不是为个人的，我们是社会主义，不能只顾个人，这样社会才能不断前进。
    访问就要结束了，徐老亲切地说，青年人看到今天这样伟大的社会，这样美好的前途，还不愉快地努力前进吗！青年人要去创造，要有革命性，生活得要有朝气，蓬蓬勃勃，失败了不要唉声叹气，我们湖南有句话说：“堕甑不顾”，这句话的意思就是说失败了不要消极，要从失败中取得教训，争取今后的胜利。
    从徐老家里走出来时，天已经黑了。迎着初春的轻凉的晚风，我一面默默地走出了胡同，一面回想着徐老刚才的一番热情深刻的谈话。年高八十一龄的徐老的一生，不就是勤工俭学的最好的榜样吗？还有什么更足以说明勤工俭学的做法对知识青年的重大政治意义呢？我觉得我很幸福，这次访问，我自己首先上了一堂深刻而生动的勤工俭学的政治课。（附图片）
