    Why is Wilcox "Irrelevant"?

    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Wilcox has once again uttered some profound nonsense: "The fact that the Soviets are linking some completely irrelevant conditions to their proposals regarding outer space... is disappointing," and so on.

    The "completely irrelevant conditions" he is referring to are clearly the Soviet proposals regarding outer space, which were accompanied by proposals for the removal of foreign military bases from the territories of all countries. Prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes is for the sake of peace; demanding the removal of foreign military bases is also for the sake of peace. How can it be said that these two are "completely irrelevant"? It is true that the United States has also put forward proposals for an agreement on the use of outer space. That is because it sees that the Soviet Union has taken the lead in controlling outer space. This is why the United States is only interested in matters above, while strenuously avoiding issues on the ground.

    If they don't give up this wishful thinking, then if the likes of Wilcox are "disappointed" or "desperate," they can just go ahead and feel that way.

### 何云“无干”？

    何云“无干”？
    美国又一位助理国务卿威尔科克斯发表高论了：“苏联人把一些毫不相干的条件与他们关于外层空间的建议联系在一起，这一事实……是令人失望的”云。
    他所指的“毫不相干的条件”，显然是说苏联在提出关于宇宙空间的建议的同时，还提出了撤除各国领土上的外国军事基地的建议。禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的，是为了和平；要求撤销外国军事基地，也是为了和平。怎么能说这两者“毫不相干”？不错，美国也提出过关于订立使用宇宙空间的协议的建议。那是因为它看到在控制宇宙空间方面，苏联走到前面去了。这就是为什么美国只对天上感兴趣，而对地上的问题极力回避的原因。
    倘不放弃这种一厢情愿的想法，威尔科克斯之流，要“失望”或者“绝望”，那只好悉听尊便吧。
