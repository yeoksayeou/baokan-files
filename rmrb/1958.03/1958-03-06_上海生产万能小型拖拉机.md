Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 4th: More than ten medium and small factories in Shanghai are adopting a collaborative approach this year, preparing to produce six to eight hundred small universal tractors. The first tractor was assembled on March 1st at the collaboration center - Hongji Iron Factory.

This small four-horsepower tractor has a wide range of uses. When various agricultural machines or tools are attached to it, it can be used for rice transplanting, plowing, harvesting, threshing, and rice milling. When connected to a water pump, it can be used for watering; when connected to a trailer, it can be used as a means of transportation, carrying 500 kilograms of rice products each time. The tractor's speed is between 2.5 and 11 kilometers per hour, and it is easy to operate and adjust, making it easy for farmers to learn. This tractor currently uses gasoline, but with slight modifications, it can be converted to use fuels such as firewood or biogas. Due to its low horsepower, it consumes less fuel and is very economical.

    上海生产万能小型拖拉机
    据新华社上海4日电　上海十多个中、小型工厂今年采取协作的方法，准备生产六百到八百台小型万能拖拉机。第一台拖拉机，在3月1日已经在协作的中心——宏记铁工厂装配完毕。
    这台有四匹马力的小型拖拉机，用途很广。在它后面挂上各种不同的农业机器或农具，就能用来插秧、翻土、收割、脱谷、碾米，接上水泵就能用来打水，接上拖车，就可以作为运输工具，每次可载运五百公斤稻物。拖拉机的时速是二公里半到十一公里，操纵和调整都很方便，农民很容易学会。这台拖拉机现在用的是汽油，稍加改装，就可以改用木柴或沼气等燃料，由于马力不大，消耗燃料少，费用很省。
