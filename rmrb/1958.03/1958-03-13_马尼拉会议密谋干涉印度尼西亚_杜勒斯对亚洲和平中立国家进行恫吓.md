Xinhua News Agency Report: According to reports from various news agencies: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council meeting continued its closed-door session on the morning of the 12th. Western news agencies, quoting sources within the meeting, reported that the main agenda items for today's secret meeting were the issues of intensifying war planning in the Southeast Asian region, pushed by the United States, and further interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

	During the morning's secret meeting, a classified report on Far East "security" issues was discussed. Attendees said the report touched upon the situation in Indonesia. The foreign ministers unreasonably rejected the Indonesian government's decision on territorial waters, made to safeguard its sovereignty and security. It was reported that representatives from New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines acknowledged in their speeches that the current situation in Indonesia was an internal affair. However, Philippine representative Sumulong specifically spread lies about "communist subversion" in Indonesia, in line with the American plot for further intervention.

	The morning meeting also agreed "in principle" to the American proposal to jointly establish a military academy in Manila with the Philippines.

	It was reported that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles spoke again in the morning, demanding that member states of this military bloc "make greater efforts" to serve the American plans for expanding military preparations and interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. Dulles reiterated that this military bloc places South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos under its "protection," which violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

	According to Western news agencies quoting sources attending the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting, Dulles, in a threatening tone at the secret meeting held in the afternoon, attacked the peaceful and neutral stance taken by Asian countries pursuing independent foreign policies as "the greatest direct threat facing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization region."

	In his keynote speech, Dulles further exposed the American conspiracy to broadly interfere in the internal affairs of countries in the region through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and to create tension in the region.

	Dulles reiterated that the United States would not change its attitude of persisting in hostility towards the Chinese people and obstructing China from restoring its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

	Dulles then stated that the United States could not increase its economic "aid" to the Asian member states of this military bloc.

	Dulles also poured cold water on the world's and the Asian people's desire for peace, and tried to belittle the significance of summit conferences. He announced that the United States would continue to maintain its so-called atomic "deterrent force."

	British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in his speech at the afternoon meeting, spoke about the issue of a summit conference between East and West. He emphasized the need for "thorough preparation first." However, his so-called "preparation" would involve substantive issues on the agenda of the summit conference.

	Australian Foreign Minister Casey attacked the People's Republic of China in his speech and demanded that this military bloc strengthen its anti-communist propaganda. At the same time, Casey expressed concern about the "economic recession" in the Southeast Asian region that is controlled or influenced by colonial countries.

	It was reported that Dulles, Lloyd, and French Foreign Minister Pineau held talks on issues such as a summit conference between East and West after the end of the secret meeting this afternoon.

    马尼拉会议密谋干涉印度尼西亚
    杜勒斯对亚洲和平中立国家进行恫吓
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：东南亚条约组织理事会会议12日上午继续举行秘密会议。据西方通讯社引会议人士透露的消息报道，美国推动的在东南亚地区加紧战争策划的问题，和进一步干涉印度尼西亚内政的问题，是今天的秘密会议的主要议程。
    在上午的秘密会议上，讨论了一项关于远东“安全”问题的秘密报告，参加会议的人士说，这项报告谈到了印度尼西亚的局势问题。外交部长无理地拒绝了印度尼西亚政府为维护主权和安全而作出的关于领海问题的决定。据报道，新西兰、巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾的代表在发言中承认，印度尼西亚目前的局势是内政问题；但是，菲律宾代表苏木朗又特别散布了符合美国进一步干涉印度尼西亚的图谋的所谓在印度尼西亚存在“共产党颠复活动”的谎言。
    今天上午的会议还在“原则上”同意了美国同菲律宾在马尼拉联合开办一个军事学院的建议。
    据报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯在上午再次发言，要求这个军事集团的成员国“进行更大的努力”，为美国扩军备战和干涉东南亚国家内政的计划服务。杜勒斯重申这个军事集团把南越、柬埔寨和老挝置于它的“保护之下”。而这是违反日内瓦协议规定的。
    据西方通讯社引参加东南亚条约组织理事会会议人士透露的消息报道，杜勒斯在下午继续举行的秘密会议上，以恫吓的口吻攻击执行独立外交政策的亚洲国家所采取的和平中立立场是“东南亚条约组织地区所面临的最大的直接的威胁”。
    杜勒斯在他的这篇主要发言中进一步暴露了美国企图通过东南亚条约组织广泛干涉这个地区的国家的内政和在这个地区中制造紧张气氛的阴谋。
    杜勒斯重申，美国将不会改变它坚持与中国人民为敌的态度和阻挠中国恢复它在联合国中合法席位的立场。
    杜勒斯接着表示美国不能增加它对这个军事集团的亚洲成员国的经济“援助”。
    杜勒斯还向世界和亚洲人民的和平愿望泼冷水，竭力贬低最高级会议的意义。他宣布美国将继续保持所谓原子“威慑力量”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在今天下午会议上所作的发言中谈到关于东西方最高级会议的问题。他强调要“首先进行充分的准备工作”。但是，他所谓的“准备工作”是要涉及到最高级会议一些议程的实质问题。
    澳大利亚外交部长凯西在发言中对中华人民共和国进行攻击，并且要求这个军事集团加强它的反共宣传。凯西同时对受殖民国家控制或影响的东南亚地区的“经济衰退”现象表示忧虑。
    据报道，杜勒斯、劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺今天下午在秘密会议结束以后，就东西方举行最高级会议等问题进行了会谈。
