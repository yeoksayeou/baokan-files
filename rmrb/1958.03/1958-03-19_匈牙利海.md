    Hungary, located in the heart of continental Europe, is surrounded by land and cut off from the sea. But for a foreign guest who visits Hungary for the first time, the enthusiastic host will always let him visit Hungary's "sea," which is Lake Balaton, southwest of Budapest.
    Lake Balaton is long and narrow from east to west, covering an area of about 600 square kilometers. It is the largest lake in Central Europe, and the Hungarians proudly call it the "Hungarian Sea."
    The mountains and valleys surrounding the lake give Lake Balaton a beautiful and moving scenery. The Tihany Peninsula on the north shore stretches deep into the center of the lake, almost dividing the lake into two halves. The south shore of the lake has a wide sandy beach. On the lake, the sun shines for 2,000 to 2,200 hours a year, and the climate is mild and pleasant. The lake water contains a large amount of mineral salts (about 500 mg per liter), which has good medicinal value. The shore of the lake is full of modern hotels, sanatoriums and villas, serving tourists.
    Siófok is the largest resort center in Lake Balaton. In the past, it was a place for the wealthy to relax and spend their summers, but now it is a workers' recreation area. There are sports fields and open-air theaters here. At the same time, it is also a central station for sightseeing boats and a paradise for fishing enthusiasts.
    The most famous place on the north shore of Lake Balaton is Balatonfüred, which is the oldest spa in the lake area. In the centuries-old garden, there are towering ancient trees everywhere, and you can also find the trees planted by the great Indian poet Tagore to commemorate his treatment of heart disease here.
    The Tihany Peninsula is also the most beautiful area of Lake Balaton. There are ancient forests and bunkers, as well as historical sites from the Stone Age and Bronze Age.
    Lake Balaton not only attracts countless tourists with its famous historical sites and resorts, but it is also a famous producer of wine and fish. The delicious salmon in the lake has long been well-known, and the "Budapesti" wine brewed with lake water is famous far and wide. The famous wines produced near Lake Balaton are an important export product of Hungary.
    The Lake Balaton area is also of great significance in industry. There are porcelain factories, shipyards and mining industries here, producing manganese, soft coal and iron bauxite. The large-scale Inota Power Plant is not far from it.

    匈牙利海
    位于欧洲大陆腹地的匈牙利，四周同大海隔绝。但是对于一个初到匈牙利的外国客人，殷勤的主人总要让他去观光一下匈牙利的“海”，这就是布达佩斯西南面的巴拉顿湖。
    巴拉顿湖东西狭长，面积约六百平方公里，是中欧最大的湖泊，匈牙利人自豪地把它叫做“匈牙利海”。
    环绕湖滨的群山和峡谷，赋予巴拉顿湖以美丽动人的景色。北岸的蒂哈尼半岛深深地伸入湖心，几乎把湖面分割为两半。湖的南岸有着广阔的沙滩。在湖上，太阳一年照耀两千到两千二百小时，气候温和宜人。湖水含有大量的矿盐（每公升约五百毫克），有很好的医疗价值。湖岸上满布现代化的旅馆、休养所和别墅，为游人服务。
    萧佛克是巴拉顿湖最大的休养中心。从前，它是阔人们消闲避暑的地方，现在是工人休养区。这里建有运动场和露天剧场。同时，它也是游览船的一个中心站和钓鱼爱好者的胜地。
    巴拉顿湖北岸最有名的地方是巴拉顿费尔德，它是湖区最古老的疗养地。在有上百年历史的花园里，到处是参天古树，还可以找到印度伟大诗人泰戈尔为纪念他在这里医治心脏病而亲手栽种的树木。
    蒂哈尼半岛也是巴拉顿湖景色最优美的地区。这里有古老的森林和碉堡，还有石器和铜器时代的历史遗迹。
    巴拉顿湖不仅以它的名胜古迹和疗养胜地吸引着无数游人，它还是酒和鱼的著名产地。湖中肉味鲜美的萨门鱼久已脍炙人口，用湖水酿制的“布达琼尼”葡萄酒更是远近驰名。巴拉顿湖附近出产的名酒，是匈牙利的一项重要的出口物产。
    巴拉顿湖地区在工业上也有着重要的意义。这里有瓷器厂、造船厂和采矿业，出产锰、烟煤和铁矾土等。规模宏大的伊诺达发电厂就在离它不远的地方。
