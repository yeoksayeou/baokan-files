Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 3rd: Over the past eight years, Guangxi's cultural undertakings have seen a leap-forward development.

The folk arts of the various ethnic groups in Guangxi are extremely rich and colorful. The Zhuang people's "Song Fair," the Miao people's "Grand Lusheng Dance," the Yao people's "Bronze Drum Dance," and the Dong people's long narrative poems each have their own unique characteristics. There are also nineteen forms of local drama, such as Gui Opera, Zhuang Opera, Dong Opera, Miao Opera, and Mountain Song Opera, as well as folk art forms such as Yu Gu, Wen Chang, Pipa, and Flower Lantern small ensemble performances. According to preliminary statistics from the 1957 arts census, there are a total of 166 art forms in Guangxi. Last year, the Zhuang people's own Zhuang Opera Troupe was established, and support was given to the new Miao Opera and Dong Opera, which developed from folk songs, so that people of all ethnic groups can have dramas performed in their own languages.

Before liberation, Guangxi had only twelve cinemas and two projection teams, showing mostly poisonous and lewd films. There were no cinemas or projection teams in minority areas. Now Guangxi has twenty-six cinemas, twenty-eight film clubs, and two hundred and three film projection teams. 58% of the film projection teams are distributed in various minority areas. In the past, the entire region had only two public libraries. Now there are seven or eight cultural centers, more than seven thousand two hundred rural clubs, and more than two thousand six hundred rural libraries. The collections of the two provincial libraries and eight county and city libraries have reached more than 840,000 volumes.

A huge school network is taking shape throughout Guangxi. Now every township has elementary schools and every county has middle schools. Last year, the number of elementary schools in minority areas had grown to 15,250, accounting for more than 69% of the total number of elementary schools in Guangxi. In some counties and cities, the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached 90%. There are 386 middle schools and normal schools in the region, 206 of which are located in minority areas. The number of college students from various ethnic minorities in Guangxi is increasing. Last year, minority students accounted for 30% of the new students admitted to Guangxi's Teachers College, Agricultural College, and Medical College. In addition, the Guangxi Institute for Nationalities has trained more than 3,000 ethnic cadres in the past five years.

The Party and the government have helped the Zhuang people create and promote their own Zhuang script, and last year they also established a Zhuang-language newspaper. By the end of last year, more than 300,000 Zhuang people had participated in Zhuang language learning, and more than 100,000 people had learned the Zhuang language.

    广西文化事业大放光采
    歌舞戏剧电影大大发展　乡乡有小学县县有中学
    据新华社南宁3日电　八年来，广西文化事业有了飞跃发展。
    广西各族人民的民间文艺十分丰富多彩。僮族的“歌墟”，苗族的“大芦笙舞”，瑶族的“铜鼓舞”，侗族的故事长诗，都各具特色。还有桂剧、僮戏、侗戏、苗戏、山歌剧等十九种形式的地方戏剧和渔鼓、文场、琵琶、花灯等形式的曲艺小演唱。根据1957年进行文艺普查的初步统计，广西共有一百六十六种艺术形式。去年成立了僮族人民自己的僮剧团，并扶持了从民歌发展起来的新的苗剧和侗剧，使各族人民有了用本民族语言表演的戏剧。
    解放前的广西，总共只有十二家电影院和两个放映队，放映的大都是充满毒素的黄色影片，少数民族地区没有一个影院和放映队。现在广西共有二十六个影院、二十八个电影俱乐部和二百零三个电影放映队。有58％的电影放映队分布在各少数民族地区。过去，全区仅有两个公共图书馆，现在已有七八个文化馆，七千二百多个农村俱乐部，二千六百多个农村图书室。两个省图书馆和八个县、市图书馆的藏书，已达八十四万多册。
    一个巨大的学校网正在广西全区形成，现在已经是乡乡有小学，县县有中学。去年少数民族地区的小学已发展到一万五千二百五十所，占广西小学总数的69％以上。有些县、市适龄儿童入学的已达到90％。全区中学、师范有三百八十六所，其中有二百零六所设在少数民族地区。广西各少数民族的大学生是越来越多了，去年广西的师范学院、农学院和医学院在录取的新生中，少数民族学生即占30％。此外，广西民族学院在近五年内，训练了三千多个民族干部。
    党和政府帮助僮族人民创制和推广了本民族的僮文，去年还创办了僮文报。到去年底，有三十多万僮族群众参加僮文的学习，十万多人已学会了僮文。
