Reported by this newspaper: On February 28th, the Beijing Chinese Painting Academy and the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association, in response to the initiative proposed by seventeen scientists in Shanghai, jointly held a meeting to discuss and adopt the "Initiative of Capital's Traditional Chinese Painters to Strive for Self-Transformation." More than forty traditional Chinese painters attended the meeting, including Yu Feian, Chen Banding, Pu Xuezhai, Ye Qianyu, Hui Xiaotong, Qin Zhongwen, Li Keran, Jiang Zhaohe, Wu Jingting, Ma Jin, Huang Jun, Hu Jieqing, and Jiang Yan.

The discussions at the meeting were extremely enthusiastic, and four directions and goals for self-transformation were proposed, expressing the determination to strive for more than 60% leftists within five years. Everyone is willing to join hands with traditional Chinese painters across the country to unite and challenge in the great leap forward of socialist science and culture, and strive to be both red and expert. In addition, a grand debate on creative leap forward will also be launched in early March, and preparations will be made to go to the Ming Tombs Reservoir to sketch, actively promoting creative prosperity.
