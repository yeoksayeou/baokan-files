    At the Anti-Waste Exhibition of the Coal Science Research Institute
    Surgical rubber gloves are also "urgently needed" by researchers.
    This isn't treating desktops and books as patients, but rather fear of dirtying their noble hands.
    Scientific researchers are truly racking their brains, using grinding machines to polish coal samples.
    Coal crystallization, you are truly thrice fortunate, easily and happily changing your appearance.
    These many imported wooden boxes are filled with instruments for studying wind speed and meteorology.
    What a pity,
    It seems there is a lack of due connection between the coal seam and the sky.
    As the name suggests, a movie camera should be an item for film studios.
    The Coal Science Research Institute specially allocated huge sums to buy one,
    Just to show off a little extravagance.

    在煤炭科学研究院反浪费展览会上
    外科医生的胶皮手套研究人员同样“迫切需要”。
    这不是把桌面和书籍当成病人，而是怕弄脏了高贵的手心。
    科学研究人员真会开动脑筋，使用磨牙机器打磨煤炭标本。
    煤炭的结晶，你真是三生有幸，轻松愉快地就改变了你的尊容。
    这许多个进口的木箱，里面装满了研究风速和气象的仪器。
    可惜呀可惜，
    煤层和天空之间似乎还缺乏应有的联系。
    顾名思义，电影摄影机应是电影制片厂的用具。
    煤炭科学研究院专拨巨款买来，
    只是为了小小的显示一下阔气。本报记者　高粮摄
