    Shanghai Assists Six Provinces in Developing Industry
    Mutual Support, Joint Leap Forward
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 11th dispatch, reporter Zhang Pei): Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, accounting for one-fifth of the country's total industrial output value, will not only supply large quantities of agricultural machinery, metal cutting machine tools, and fertilizer equipment to all parts of the country this year, but also undertake the collaborative task of supporting the development of local industries in the six provinces of East China.
    According to the reporter's understanding from relevant departments in Shanghai, the projects for support and collaboration have been largely determined, and some of them have already been underway, such as the steel plants in Hushu Pass, Jiangsu, and Shaoxing, Zhejiang.
    In 1958, Shanghai will allocate a large sum of funds to support the six provinces of East China. Most of these funds will be used to develop local industrial and mining enterprises, and a small portion will be used to develop non-staple food production. The industrial and mining projects for collaborative construction are tentatively determined as follows: lead-zinc mines, iron smelting plants, cement plants, and coal mines in Jiangsu; steel plants, pulp mills, kraft paper mills, calcium carbide plants, and cement plants in Zhejiang; coal mines, iron smelting plants, and copper mines in Anhui; chemical wood pulp mills and sugar refineries in Fujian; coal mines, ramie fiber plants, and sanitary ceramics factories in Shandong; and coal mines and copper mines in Jiangxi. In terms of non-staple food production, the scope of collaboration is even broader, ranging from ham and cured meat to vegetables, fruits, and even shiitake mushrooms, wood ear fungus, and walnuts. This collaboration will not only promote the development of local industries in various provinces but also contribute to the development of Shanghai's industry. For example, one of the contradictions that has emerged in Shanghai after the Great Leap Forward in industry is the shortage of certain raw materials, especially non-ferrous metals such as copper. Collaborating with Anhui and Jiangxi to build copper mines is one of the ways to solve this contradiction. After the development of the coal industry in East China, it can supply more coal needed by Shanghai's coking and chemical enterprises. Due to the establishment of this cooperative relationship, Shanghai can obtain more timber and bamboo from Jiangxi and Fujian, which are extremely needed raw materials for Shanghai. Helping provinces develop non-staple food production can not only promote the leap forward in agriculture in various provinces but also increase the supply of non-staple food for Shanghai's seven million residents.
    In addition to financial cooperation in construction, the exchange of materials between Shanghai and various provinces is becoming increasingly frequent. This year, Shanghai will directly supply several equipment to various provinces outside the central allocation (such as motors, transformers, machine tools, boilers, blowers, water pumps, etc.). Raw materials and local specialties from various provinces will also be continuously transported to Shanghai. Shanghai will also help provinces train technical personnel and organize technical personnel to conduct guidance in various places. In addition, Shanghai is also preparing to organize a group of laborers to develop the mountainous areas of southern Anhui and Fujian. This will not only strengthen the construction force in the mountainous areas of these two provinces but also establish raw material bases for Shanghai's light industry.
    The economic cooperation between Shanghai and the six provinces of East China is still in its initial stage, but it is already showing a good beginning. It can be affirmed that economic cooperation between regions under the socialist system is one of the good forms to solve the contradictions of unbalanced economic development and different needs in various regions of our country, and it is an effective method to support each other, make a joint leap forward, and promote socialist construction.

### 上海协助六省办工业  互相支援　共同跃进

    上海协助六省办工业
    互相支援　共同跃进
    本报上海11日电　记者张沛报道：上海这个占全国工业生产总额五分之一的我国最大的工业中心，今年除了要供给全国各地大量农业机械、金属切削机床、化肥设备等产品外，还担负着支援华东六省发展地方工业的协作任务。
    据记者从上海有关部门了解，支援和协作的项目已经大体确定，其中有的项目早已进行，如江苏浒墅关、浙江绍兴的钢铁厂等。
    1958年，上海要拿出一大笔资金支援华东六省。其中大部分发展地方工矿企业，小部分发展副食品生产。协作建设的工矿项目初步确定是：江苏的铅锌矿、炼铁厂、水泥厂、煤矿；浙江的钢铁厂、纸浆厂、黄板纸厂、电石厂、水泥厂；安徽的煤矿、炼铁厂、铜矿；福建的化学木浆厂、制糖厂；山东的煤矿、罗布麻纤维厂、卫生陶瓷厂；江西的煤矿、铜矿。在副食品生产方面，协作的范围更加广泛，从火腿、咸肉、蔬菜、水果直至香菇、木耳、核桃。这种协作不仅能促进各省地方工业的发展，而且有助于上海工业的发展。例如，上海在工业大跃进以后，出现的矛盾之一是某些原料不足，其中特别感到缺乏的是有色金属，如铜。和安徽、江西协作建设铜矿，就是解决这个矛盾的办法之一。华东各省煤炭工业发展以后，可以更多地供应上海炼焦化工企业所需要的煤炭。由于这种协作关系的建立，上海可以得到江西、福建更多的木材和竹子，这是上海极端需要的原材料。帮助各省发展副食品生产，既可以促进各省农业的跃进，同时可以增加对上海七百万市民的副食品供应。
    除了建设资金方面的协作以外，上海和各省的物资交流日益频繁。今年上海将在中央分配以外直接供应各省若干设备（如电动机、变压器、机床、锅炉、鼓风机、水泵等）。各省的原料和土特产也将源源运沪。上海还将帮助各省培训技术力量和组织技术人员到各地进行指导。另外，上海还准备组织一批劳动力去开发皖南和福建的山区。这样既能加强这两省的山区建设力量，又能为上海的轻工业建立原料基地。
    上海和华东六省的经济协作，还处在一个开始阶段，然而已经看得出这是一个良好的端倪。可以肯定：社会主义制度下各地区的经济协作，是解决我国各地区经济发展不平衡、需求不同的矛盾的良好形式之一，是互相支援、共同跃进、推进社会主义建设的有效方法。
