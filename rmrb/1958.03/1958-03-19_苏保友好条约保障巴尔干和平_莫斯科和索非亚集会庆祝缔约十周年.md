Xinhua News Agency, March 18th News from TASS, Moscow: On March 17th, Moscow held an evening gathering to solemnly celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. This treaty was signed in Moscow on March 18th, 1948.
    Moskatov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty was aimed at German militarism and possible aggression by other countries. The treaty we signed with Bulgaria has become a powerful factor in safeguarding peace and security in the Balkans. Now that the American ruling clique is pursuing a policy of reviving German militarism and threatening peace and security in Europe and the world, this treaty is of particular importance.
    Bulgarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Gerasimov said at the celebration meeting that the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty reflects the will and desire of the people of the two countries, which is to fight for the cause of peace, against imperialist policies, and to strengthen and develop friendly relations and fraternal cooperation among all peace-loving countries. The Bulgarian people are firmly advancing along the road of building socialism. The Bulgarian people will work together with the Soviet Union and socialist countries to fight for peace and against enemies who undermine peaceful labor and destroy the freedom and independence of all peoples.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 17th: The National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, the National Committee of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association, the Bulgarian Committee for Foreign Friendship and Cultural Relations, and the Sofia City Committee of the Fatherland Front held a grand rally in Sofia on March 17th to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Bulgarian-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, Raiko Damyanov, Chervenkov, Mikhailov, and other diplomatic envoys from some countries to Bulgaria attended the meeting.
    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet-Bulgarian Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance created the most fundamental preconditions for the rapid development of Bulgaria's socialist economy. Thanks to the constant assistance of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria's national economy has continued to flourish. Like other similar treaties signed with socialist countries, the Soviet-Bulgarian treaty is a new type of treaty, which has nothing in common with the military or other treaties signed between imperialist powers and small countries.
    Lukanov then said that the Bulgarian people are loyal to the principles of the socialist camp and its combat unity and fraternal mutual assistance. He pointed out that members of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the entire people resolutely oppose all forms of revisionism. For the Bulgarian people, the principle of proletarian internationalism, friendship with the Soviet Union, and the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism are inseparable from the interests of the Bulgarian people. Next, Soviet Ambassador to Bulgaria Prikhodov spoke. He warmly congratulated the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Bulgarian people forged with blood. He read out the congratulatory messages from Voroshilov, Khrushchev, and Bulganin to Georgi Damyanov, Zhivkov, and Yugov.
    The meeting finally adopted congratulatory messages to Voroshilov, Khrushchev, and Bulganin.

    苏保友好条约保障巴尔干和平
    莫斯科和索非亚集会庆祝缔约十周年
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：3月17日，莫斯科举行了晚会，隆重庆祝苏联和保加利亚友好合作互助条约签订十周年。这个条约是1948年3月18日在莫斯科签订的。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表莫斯卡托夫在会上作了报告。他指出，苏保条约的锋芒针对着德国军国主义和其他国家的可能的侵略。我们同保加利亚签订的条约成为保障巴尔干和平和安全的有力因素。现在美国统治集团执行着复活德国军国主义和威胁欧洲及世界和平与安全的政策，因此这个条约就有着特别重要的意义。
    保加利亚驻苏联大使格拉西莫夫在庆祝大会上讲话说，保苏条约反映了两国人民的意志和愿望，这就是为和平事业、为反对帝国主义政策而斗争，为加强和发展一切爱好和平国家的友好关系和兄弟合作而斗争。保加利亚人民坚定不移地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。保加利亚人民将同苏联和社会主义国家一道，共同为争取和平和反对破坏和平劳动、破坏各国人民自由和独立的敌人而斗争。
    新华社索非亚17日电　保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会、保苏友好协会全国委员会、保加利亚对外友好和文化联络委员会和祖国阵线索非亚市委员会，3月17日在索非亚市举行盛大集会，庆祝保苏友好合作互助条约签订十周年。保加利亚共产党和政府领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫、拉·达米扬诺夫、契尔文科夫、米哈伊洛夫等以及一些国家驻保加利亚的外交使节出席了会议。
    保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫在会上作了报告。他指出，保苏友好合作互助条约为保加利亚社会主义经济的迅速发展创造了最基本的先决条件。由于苏联的不断援助，保加利亚国民经济得到了不断的高涨。同社会主义各国签订的其他类似的条约一样，保苏条约是新型的条约，它和帝国主义大国同小国间签订的军事或其他条约是毫无共同之处的。
    卢卡诺夫接着说，保加利亚人民忠实于社会主义阵营及其战斗团结和兄弟互助的原则。他指出，保共党员和全体人民坚决反对各种形式的修正主义。对保加利亚人民来说，无产阶级国际主义原则、同苏联的友谊和马克思列宁主义学说，是同保加利亚人民的利益密不可分的。接着，苏联驻保加利亚大使普里霍多夫讲了话。他热烈祝贺保苏两国人民间用鲜血结成的兄弟友谊不断巩固和加强。他宣读了伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁致格·达米扬诺夫、日夫科夫和于哥夫的贺电。
    会议最后通过了致伏罗希洛夫、赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁的贺电。
