Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Philosophical workers in the capital emphasized that in the most active period of people's thoughts, philosophy, as the embodiment of the spirit of the times, should also make a great leap forward.

Philosophical workers in the capital proposed to promote the great leap forward in Chinese philosophical research by clarifying the direction of philosophical research, transforming the ideology of philosophical workers, and improving the style of research work. This was their common opinion expressed yesterday at the philosophy symposium held by the State Council's Science Planning Commission. The symposium discussed the great leap forward in philosophical research under the chairmanship of Pan Zinian, head of the philosophy professional group of the Science Planning Commission.

Ai Siqi said at the meeting that in order to make philosophical research work leap forward, it is necessary not only to have drive, but also to have a clear direction of research – that is, to apply dialectical materialism in practical work as pointed out in the Moscow Declaration; after China's completion of the three major transformations, there have been many new developments in theory, which are worthy of our careful study. When he talked about "stressing the present and belittling the past," he said that when we study the history of philosophy, we should also pay attention to the problem of applying dialectical materialism in practical work, so that we can have a correct view of the struggle between materialism and idealism, and many problems in the history of philosophy will be easily solved; the purpose of studying the history of philosophy is to understand the historical struggle between materialism and idealism and draw lessons from it. Ai Siqi attached great importance to popularizing philosophy while improving it. He quoted Marx as saying that philosophy must be popularized in order to be thorough.

Hu Sheng believes that now should be a period of great development and improvement of Chinese philosophy. He said that philosophy is the embodiment of the spirit of the times, and now is the most active period of Chinese people's thinking: various contradictions, especially contradictions among the people, have been manifested; the activity of practical life means that new things appear every day. This is the period for "producing philosophy." The problem is what the philosophical workers should do. Hu Sheng said that philosophical workers often feel that there are not many topics, but in fact there are many topics now, such as many ideological struggles with principled issues left over from the anti-Rightist struggle that have not been well discussed; the criticism of bourgeois ideology should also be linked to the issues that the broad masses of people are concerned about and debated. In short, we must study contradictions among the people, which is the general topic and a new issue with much to be done. Hu Sheng emphasized that philosophical workers should study practical work, for example, they can help a good agricultural cooperative summarize leadership experience, or they can help a bad agricultural cooperative summarize lessons learned. Feng Ding also pointed out that there are many philosophical materials in practical life, which are readily available. For example, issues such as balance and imbalance, redness and expertise, experimental fields, and grasping the advanced and backward to drive the middle are all good topics.

Speakers at the meeting unanimously proposed that philosophical workers should carefully study, research, and interpret Chairman Mao's works. They believe that Chairman Mao's works are a model of applying dialectical materialism in revolutionary practice in China in recent decades. The Department of Philosophy of Renmin University of China has organized a Research Association of Mao Zedong's Philosophical Works, first formulating a batch of special topics, and then gradually carrying out systematic research.

Some people talked about changing research style and ideological criticism. He Zhiping hoped that philosophers would jump out of their studies and go to factories and rural areas to experience life. He said that studies are mainly filled with ancient people, and one cannot smell the atmosphere of the times. Sun Dingguo also said that philosophical workers should put down their airs and take root among the people and in life, so that they can have the power of a great leap forward. When he talked about the importance of criticizing bourgeois philosophy, he pointed out that those with bourgeois philosophical ideas should first bravely expose their own problems, conduct self-struggle, and then strive for the help of the masses. Ren Hua advocated organizing report meetings and symposiums to criticize bourgeois ideology, so that everyone can inspire each other and exchange information. Wu Jiang emphasized the issue of collaboration in philosophical research. He suggested establishing a Philosophical Society in Beijing; regular philosophical symposiums can be organized, with contradictions among the people as the center of discussion.

Physicist Zhu Hongyuan made a request to the philosophical community at the meeting, asking them to help solve some philosophical problems in natural science. He said that natural scientists can provide philosophers with natural science materials for research. Pan Zinian then said, can natural scientists and philosophers form an alliance?

Philosophical workers from news and publishing organizations put forward many hopes to the philosophical community. Sha Ying, deputy director of the Culture and Education Department of the People's Daily, hoped that while writing large works, philosophical workers should also pay attention to by-products – short and popular philosophical articles, which can be published in newspapers and periodicals. Lin Yushi, editor of "Philosophical Research," hoped that the philosophical community would write more philosophical book reviews, which are expected by both authors and readers. Chen Maoyi, editor of "Study" magazine, reflected the requirements of the broad masses of readers for the philosophical community: write more philosophical articles on the following three aspects: helping cadres and intellectuals understand the party's various policies; issues of work methods and thinking methods; and explaining Chairman Mao's works.

More than 80 philosophical workers from universities, scientific research institutions, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, and the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China participated in the meeting.

### 哲学研究工作的方向： 在实际工作中运用辩证唯物主义

    哲学研究工作的方向：
    在实际工作中运用辩证唯物主义
    首都哲学工作者强调指出：在人民思想最活跃的时期，时代精神的表现——哲学也要大跃进。
    新华社29日讯　首都哲学工作者提出要以明确哲学研究方向、改造哲学工作者的思想和改进研究工作作风来促进中国哲学研究工作大跃进。这是昨日他们在国务院科学规划委员会召开的哲学座谈会上表示的共同意见。座谈会在科学规划委员会哲学专业组组长潘梓年主持下讨论了哲学研究工作大跃进问题。
    艾思奇在会上说，要使哲学研究工作跃进，不但要有干劲，而且要有明确的研究方向——就是莫斯科宣言中指出的在实际工作中运用辩证唯物主义；我国进行三大改造以后，理论上有许多新的发展，这是值得我们很好地研究的。他谈到“厚今薄古”时说，我们研究哲学史，也要注意在实际工作中运用辩证唯物主义问题，这样对唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争就会有正确的看法，哲学史中的许多问题就容易解决；研究哲学史的目的，就是为了了解历史上唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争，从中吸取经验教训。艾思奇很重视哲学在提高的同时进行普及工作，他引用马克思的话说，哲学要大众化才能彻底。
    胡绳认为现在应该是中国哲学大发展和提高的时期，他说，哲学是时代精神的表现，现在是中国人民思想最活跃的时期：各种矛盾尤其是人民内部矛盾都表现出来了；实际生活的活跃，每天都有新鲜事物出现。这就是“出哲学”的时期。问题在于哲学工作者怎么做。胡绳说，哲学工作者常常感到题目不多，其实现在题目就很多，例如反右派斗争时留下来的许多带原则性的思想斗争问题，还没有很好地讨论；批判资产阶级思想也要同当前广大人民关心和争论的问题联系起来，总之，要研究人民内部矛盾，这就是总的题目，这是个新问题，大有文章可做。胡绳强调哲学工作者要研究实际工作，例如可以帮助一个好的农业社总结领导经验，也可以帮助一个坏的农业社总结教训。冯定也指出实际生活中的哲学材料很多，俯拾即是。例如平衡与不平衡、红与专、试验田、抓先进落后两头带动中间等等问题都是很好的课题。
    会上发言者一致提出哲学工作者应该好好地学习、研究和解释毛主席的著作，他们认为毛主席的著作就是中国近几十年来在革命实践中应用辩证唯物主义的典范。中国人民大学哲学系已经组织了毛泽东哲学著作研究会，先订出了一批专题，然后逐步开展系统研究。
    有些人谈到了改变研究作风和思想批判问题。贺致平希望哲学家从书斋里跳出来，跳到工厂农村中去体验生活。他说，书斋里主要是古人，闻不到时代的气息。孙定国也说，哲学工作者要放下架子，到人民中、生活中去扎根，这样才能有大跃进的力量。他在谈到批判资产阶级哲学的重要性时指出，有资产阶级哲学思想的人首先要自己勇于揭盖子，来个自我斗争，然后争取群众的帮助。任华主张组织批判资产阶级思想的报告会和座谈会，以便大家互相启发，交流情况。吴江强调哲学研究工作的协作问题。他建议在北京成立哲学会；可以组织定期的哲学座谈会，把人民内部矛盾定为讨论中心。
    物理学家朱洪元在会上向哲学界提出一个要求，要求他们帮助解决自然科学中的一些哲学问题。他说，自然科学家可以为哲学家提供可资研究的自然科学材料。潘梓年接着说，自然科学家和哲学家可否来一个联盟？
    新闻出版机关的哲学工作者向哲学界提出了许多希望。人民日报文教部副主任沙英希望哲学工作者在写大著作的同时，也要注意副产品——短小通俗的哲学文章，可在报刊上发表。“哲学研究”编辑部林聿时希望哲学界多写哲学书评，这是作者和读者双方所盼望的。“学习”杂志编辑陈茂仪反映了广大读者对哲学界的要求：多写有关下列三方面内容的哲学文章：帮助干部和知识分子领会党的各项政策；工作方法和思想方法问题；解释毛主席的著作。
    参加这次会议的有高等学校、科学研究机构、报刊杂志和出版社以及中共中央宣传部等部门的哲学工作者八十多人。
