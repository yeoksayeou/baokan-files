Red Water River, Rolling Red Waves (Selected Zhuang Folk Songs)

　　White bandits in the deep mountains
　　Bright crescent moon hangs in the sky
　　White bandits in the deep mountains
　　The moon is accompanied by stars
　　Brother carries sister's heart with him
　　Out of the prison gate hand in hand
　　Nine hundred and ninety iron chains
　　Chain brother's neck, lock sister's hand
　　The official yamen is frightening
　　Out of the prison gate hand in hand

　　Red Water River, Rolling Red Waves
　　Red waves roll in the Red Water River
　　The Red Army arrives beside the Red River
　　Standing on the high mountain, a shout
　　Flames of revenge spread throughout the village

　　Looking for Brother Baqun
　　Want to cross the river to the other side to build a bridge
　　To make revolution, looking for Brother Baqun
　　The officials fear Brother Baqun
　　Tigers and wolves abound in the Nanshan gully
　　A gunshot, and they’re in their lair
　　The official troops are thousands upon thousands
　　Every one of them afraid of Brother Baqun

　　Rely on the Seventh Red Army
　　Catching fish, not afraid of deep water
　　Fighting tigers requires entering the mountains and forests
　　Turning the world upside down relies on the Seventh Red Army

　　Flesh and blood cannot be separated
　　Big trees don't leave their roots
　　Flesh and blood cannot be separated
　　Brother's life and death are linked to the Seventh Red Army

　　Mountain songs in the production team
　　The road is straight and flat, no need to bend
　　Good horses are fat, no need for saddles
　　Brother and sister save the matchmaker’s fees
　　Mountain songs in the production team
