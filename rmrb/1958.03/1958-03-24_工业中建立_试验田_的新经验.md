The experience of cultivating experimental fields has solved the leadership problems in agricultural production and has also opened up a path for cadres to become "both red and expert." Now, all walks of life are learning from this experience and applying it to their own work. How to cultivate experimental fields in industry? Some are organizing "one-stop" systems (Wuhan), and some are implementing "follow-the-shift labor" (Tianjin). On March 20th, this newspaper introduced several experiences of the Fuxin Central Machine Repair Factory and the Ping'an Coal Mine going among the masses to lead them and leading production in the production process. These are all good attempts to apply the leadership method of experimental fields to industry, eliminate bureaucracy in industrial enterprises, and reform the leadership style of industrial enterprises. We hope that the leading cadres of all industrial and mining enterprises will learn from the experiences of Fuxin, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places, and widely apply the leadership method of cultivating experimental fields to industry, so as to bring about a major transformation in the leadership style of industrial and mining enterprises. This is of great significance for organizing a great leap forward in industrial production.

In our society, the leading cadres of enterprises and the masses of workers are completely equal, which everyone realizes. In most places, the work style of the majority of enterprise leading cadres is good. However, can it be said that the leadership style of industrial and mining enterprises is perfect? Obviously, it is still far from perfect, and the phenomenon of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality is still quite common.

May we ask, what is the reality of industrial and mining enterprises? The biggest reality of industrial and mining enterprises is production. If the leading cadres of enterprises are divorced from reality, they are also divorced from production. It seems that this is an unimaginable thing. How can leading production be divorced from production? How can production be led if it is divorced from production? However, there are indeed such things, leading production while being divorced from production. The Ping'an Mine No. 3 Pit in Fuxin had an important discovery in this transformation of leadership style. It turned out that the most fundamental shortcoming in leading production in the past was "underground production, above-ground command." Coal mines are known as mobile underground factories, and the geological conditions are constantly changing. Effective measures must be taken in a timely manner in response to these constantly changing natural conditions in order to extract coal. This requires the leading cadres to have the most rapid and thorough understanding of the underground situation. However, the leading cadres stayed above ground, sitting in the office. They did not accurately understand the actual situation of production, relying on meetings, listening to reports; those who "went deeper" relied on occasionally going down the mine for a cursory look, and then issuing orders. Just imagine, how can production be led well in this way? How can bureaucracy, subjectivism, and formalism be overcome? In fact, this phenomenon of "leadership divorced from production" is not just a "special product" of the Ping'an Mine No. 3 Pit in the past. Aren't many of our factory directors, mine managers, and company managers sitting in the office, relying on meetings, telephones, and bulletin boards to "lead" production?

What is the most important thing in the lives of the masses? The answer is: production. Being divorced from production, the greatest reality, is also being divorced from the masses. If the leaders do not know the joys and sorrows of the masses in production, how can the two sides have more common ground? If the leading cadres always sit in office buildings and meeting rooms when they go to work, and live in "cadre dormitories" when they get off work, and it is difficult to meet the workers a few times a month, and they only meet at large meetings, how can they connect with the masses, how can they truly make friends with the workers and make the workers willing to pour out their hearts? Being divorced from the masses means being divorced from the most active factor in production—people, which inevitably leads to an inability to accurately grasp the production situation and lead production.

Being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality is bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is a manifestation of production relations restricting the development of productive forces. Is this saying too much? Not at all. The relationship between enterprise leaders and the masses of workers is precisely a part of production relations. In class society, this relationship is based on private ownership of the means of production and is a relationship between different classes, and therefore antagonistic. In socialist society, the history of private ownership of the means of production has ended, and this production relationship is a relationship within the people, and is non-antagonistic. However, in socialist society, if the relationship between enterprise leaders and the masses of workers is not handled well, for example, if the bureaucracy of enterprise leaders restricts the production enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers, it will also hinder the development of productive forces. This requires using the method of rectification to change the uncoordinated phenomena in certain links of production relations. Why burn away bureaucracy? Why is so much emphasis placed on transforming leadership style? The significance lies here.

It should be admitted that in the past few years, especially after the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party put forward the call to share weal and woe with the masses, industrial and mining enterprises in various places have made many attempts to find out how to closely connect with the masses and how to improve leadership methods, and have achieved certain results. But now it seems that some of the methods implemented at that time were not thorough. For example, the establishment of employee reception rooms and reception days, although it also solved some problems for the masses, still carried a "yamen" air of waiting for workers to come to the door. Another example is visiting employee dormitories once a month or once a week. This way of visiting door-to-door is a step forward compared to sitting and waiting for visitors, but in the workers' families, leading cadres are still rare guests and cannot become true confidants. Later, these practices gradually slackened. Why? It seems that there is only one main reason: at that time, no rectification was carried out, so bureaucracy was not swept away, and the thinking of the leading cadres had not changed. Now, some industrial and mining enterprises in Fuxin and other places have fiercely burned away bureaucracy in the rectification and reform, and the thinking of the leading cadres has changed, so they have set an example in applying the experience of experimental fields.

At present, the "double anti" movement is sweeping the country with irresistible momentum, and we hope that all industrial and mining enterprises in the country will use raging fire to burn away bureaucracy in this movement.

Every industrial leader must deeply understand that production is a complex and constantly developing thing, and it is by no means possible to understand it clearly by sitting in the office. Even if every leader's office is equipped with a television set, it can only see the superficial phenomena of production, but cannot see the key to production, and still cannot correctly lead production. Only when leading cadres personally participate in production can they understand production, and then they can talk about leading production. The masses are the masters of production, and not understanding the masses is equivalent to not understanding production. And only by living among the masses, making friends with the workers like an ordinary worker, can we truly understand the masses. Cultivating industrial experimental fields requires leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises to select a certain method to directly participate in production labor according to the production characteristics of their enterprises, gain experience, and truly live among the workers to lead the workers and lead production.

The policy of relying on the working class to run the enterprise well is one that we have long established. We have explored many experiences in recent years on how to make this policy concrete, such as establishing a workers' representative assembly system, organizing labor competitions, etc. However, it still feels inadequate. Whenever this issue is discussed, many leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises are somewhat distressed. It is not that there are many abstract principles and few concrete methods; it is that although there are some concrete methods, there is little systematic experience. The cultivation of experimental fields in agriculture has pointed out a path for us. Some industrial and mining enterprises in Fuxin and other places have already explored some experience on this road, although it may not be very complete, but as long as all industrial and mining enterprises learn from it, and constantly enrich it and develop it, it can be believed that the leadership level of my country's industry will also be rapidly improved.

### 工业中建立“试验田”的新经验

    工业中建立“试验田”的新经验
    种试验田，解决了农业生产的领导问题，也开辟了一条使干部“又红又专”的道路。现在，各行各业都在学习这个经验，把它运用到自己的工作中去。工业方面怎样种试验田呢？有组织“一条龙”的（武汉），有实行“跟班劳动”的（天津）。3月20日，本报又介绍了阜新中央机修厂和平安煤矿到群众中间去领导群众、在生产过程中领导生产的几项经验。这些，都是把试验田的领导方法运用到工业中去，打掉工业企业中的官气，革新工业企业领导作风的良好的尝试。我们希望各个工矿企业的领导干部都来学习阜新、天津、武汉等地的经验，把种试验田的领导方法广泛地运用到工业上去，使工矿企业的领导作风来一个大转变。这对于组织工业生产大跃进有十分重大的意义。
    在我们这个社会里，企业的领导干部和职工群众完全处于平等的地位，这是大家都体会到的。不论在什么地方，多数企业领导干部的作风也是好的。然而，能不能说工矿企业的领导作风就十分完美了呢？显然，还差得很远，脱离群众、脱离实际的现象还相当普遍。
    试问，什么是工矿企业的实际呢？工矿企业最大的实际就是生产。企业的领导干部脱离实际，也就是脱离生产。看来，这似乎是不可想像的事情。领导生产怎么会脱离生产呢？脱离生产又怎么能领导生产呢？然而，确实有这样的事情，脱离了生产还在领导着生产。阜新平安矿三坑在这次转变领导作风中有一个重要的发现。原来过去领导生产最根本的缺点在于“井下生产，井上指挥”。煤矿，被称为地下作业的流动工厂，岩层情况千变万化，必须针对这种不断变化的自然情况，适时地采取有效措施，才能把煤炭开采出来。这就要求领导干部最迅速地对井下情况做到了如指掌。然而，领导干部却是呆在井上，坐在办公室里的。他们并不确切地了解生产的实际情况，靠着开会、听汇报；“深入”一点的，靠着偶尔下一次矿井走马看花，就指手划脚地发号施令了。试想，这怎么能把生产领导得好呢？官僚主义、主观主义、文牍主义等等，又怎么能克服呢？其实，这种“脱离生产的领导”现象，岂只是过去平安矿三坑的“特产”，我们有许多厂长、矿长、公司经理不都是坐在办公室里，靠开会、靠电话、靠布告牌“领导”生产的吗？
    什么是群众生活中最主要的事情？答曰：生产。脱离了生产这个最大的实际，也就脱离了群众。群众在生产中的甘苦，领导不知道，双方怎能有更多的共同语言呢？如果领导干部上班总是坐在办公楼和会议室里，下班是住在“干部宿舍”里，一个月也难同工人见几回面，见面也只在大会上，这怎么能够联系群众，怎么能真正同工人交上朋友、使工人愿意把心里话掏出来讲呢？脱离群众就是脱离生产中最积极的因素——人，这就一定不能准确地掌握生产情况和领导生产了。
    脱离群众，脱离实际，这就是官气。官气就是生产关系束缚生产力的一种表现。这话是不是说重了呢？并不。企业领导者和职工群众的关系，正是生产关系的一部分。在阶级社会里，这种关系建立在生产资料私有制的基础上，是不同阶级之间的关系，因而是对抗性的。在社会主义社会里，结束了生产资料私有制的历史，这种生产关系是人民内部的关系，是非对抗性的。但是，在社会主义社会里，企业领导者和职工群众的关系处理得不好，例如企业领导者的官气束缚了职工群众的生产积极性和创造性，同样会障碍生产力的发展。这就需要用整风的方法来改变生产关系某些环节上的不协调现象。为什么要烧掉官气？为什么十分强调转变领导作风？其意义就在这里。
    应该承认，过去几年来，特别是党的八届二中全会提出同群众共甘苦的号召以后，各地工矿企业对于怎样密切同群众的联系、怎样改进领导方法，都作过许多尝试，并且取得了一定成绩。但是现在看来，当时实行的某些办法，还是不彻底的。例如建立职工接待室和接待日，虽然也给群众解决了一些问题，但还带有等工人上门的“衙门气”。又例如每月或每周到职工宿舍访问一次，这种登门拜访的方式比坐待来访是进了一步，但在工人家庭里，领导干部毕竟还是稀客，不能成为真正的知心朋友。后来这些做法也都逐渐松懈了。为什么呢？看来，主要原因只有一条：当时还没有进行整风，因而官气未扫，领导干部的思想还没有变过来。现在阜新等地的一些工矿企业在整改中狠狠地烧了烧官气，领导干部的思想变过来了，因此他们在运用试验田的经验上做出榜样来了。
    目前，“双反”运动正以锐不可当的声势席卷全国，我们希望全国各个工矿企业都在这个运动中用烈火烧掉官气。
    必须让每一个工业领导人员深刻地懂得：生产是一件复杂的、不断发展的事情，决不是坐在办公室里能够了解清楚的。即便每个领导干部的办公室里都安一架电视机，也只能看到生产的表面现象，而不能洞察生产的关键何在，还是不能正确地领导生产。只有领导干部亲自参加生产，才能了解生产，从而谈得到领导生产。群众则是生产的主人，不了解群众，等于不了解生产。而只有生活在群众中间，像一个普通劳动者一样地同工人交朋友，才能真正地了解群众。种工业试验田，就是要求工矿企业的领导干部根据本企业的生产特点，选择一定的方式直接参加生产劳动，取得经验，并且真正生活在工人中间来领导工人，领导生产。
    依靠工人群众办好企业的方针是我们早就确立了的。怎样使这个方针具体化，几年来也摸索出许多经验，如建立职工代表大会制度，组织劳动竞赛等等。然而，总还感到不足。每逢谈到这个问题，许多工矿企业的领导干部都有些苦恼。不是说抽象的原则多，具体的办法少；就是说具体的办法虽有一些，但系统的经验少。农业方面种试验田给我们指了一条路。阜新等地的一些工矿企业已经在这条路上摸出一些经验，虽然也不一定十分完整，但只要各个工矿企业都学起来，并且不断地充实它，发展它，可以相信我国工业的领导水平也必将有迅速的提高。
