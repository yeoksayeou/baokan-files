A scholar who stays home finds it hard to know the world's affairs!
Che Jianzhi

There's a saying that "a scholar, without stepping outside his gate, knows all the world's affairs." This is a compliment to intellectuals. Now, it seems this saying is inaccurate. I think it would be more fitting to change it to "a scholar who stays home finds it hard to know the world's affairs."

Recently, the news about the great leap forward and the comparing and catching up with the advanced has been filling the newspapers, which is very exciting. However, some "scholars" who stay at home feel confused or don't have a deep understanding of this. After reading the newspapers, they can be said to "know" these "world affairs" in terms of the words, but they don't have concrete feelings. Some people feel that their thinking is lagging behind the situation, which causes them distress. Some people naively ask, "Is this rapid acceleration a bit rash?" For these "scholars," it's best to "go out" and take a look, whether it's a quick glance or a detailed examination, or participating in labor, all of which will be beneficial.

Although I wouldn't consider myself a "scholar," I am one of those who have been sitting in the office for a long time and feel that my thinking is lagging behind the situation. This time, participating in the labor at the Ming Tombs Reservoir allowed me to see concretely what the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is all about.

On the first night of labor, a comrade from the Changping District Committee introduced us to the situation at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, mentioning the enthusiasm of the migrant workers. When the district committee had just decided to build this reservoir, the next morning, thousands of migrant workers came to the construction site with their own tools and food. At that time, eating and living were very difficult, the cooking stoves hadn't been prepared in time, and the sleeping places had no straw mats on the ground, but everyone had no complaints about this. On the contrary, they demonstrated full revolutionary enthusiasm in their labor. At that time, there were no roads on the mountain, and the weather was particularly cold. Many migrant workers carried double baskets of soil, finding their own way to pass, they were not walking but running, their slogan was: We must build the Ming Tombs Reservoir well!

Hearing these things was already touching enough, but seeing is believing. The lively and dynamic scene on the construction site is far beyond what my clumsy pen can describe. Look, the labor army of the troops is opening up the mountain here, and the migrant workers' brigade is transporting soil with dump trucks on the narrow-gauge railway there. The crowds of people coming and going to transport soil to the dam are continuous. A level six gale is blowing in the sky, making it difficult to stand still; dust and sand are flying, blinding people's eyes, but people have not been frightened by the strong wind. "We must build the Ming Tombs Reservoir before the mountain flood comes!" This is everyone's common voice.

The labor army of the organs also withstood this test. Many comrades were white-faced scholars who had never carried or handled heavy objects before. After a few days of training, they were able to carry dozens or even hundreds of pounds of sand and gravel for hundreds of meters. However, compared to the troops and migrant workers, they were still far behind. One comrade joked, "Our enthusiasm can only be called 'enthusiasm,' the enthusiasm of the troops and migrant worker comrades can be called 'real revolutionary enthusiasm.'" Let's not delve into whether "enthusiasm" and "revolutionary enthusiasm" are two different things in terms of words, but from this, we can see how great the enthusiasm of the masses is.

The Ming Tombs Reservoir is only a small unit in the national construction, but "from the small to understand the big," one can imagine how people are leaping forward in factories, rural areas, and various construction units across the country. People are power, and when the power of the people is brought into play, they can move mountains and overturn seas, and be invincible. But this is difficult for "scholars" who have been sitting in their studies for a long time and not going out to understand. The Party Central Committee has instructed that leading cadres should take time each year to go down to "take a quick look" and "take a detailed look," and that cadres should be sent to the grassroots for labor and training. This is really calling on us "scholars" who have not gone out to go out and take a look, to train in actual struggle. This will broaden our horizons, let us know the great events of the world, recognize the power of the masses, and help eliminate bureaucracy and conservative thinking, and overthrow officialdom and official airs. Facts have proven that it is definitely not possible for a scholar to stay at home.

    秀才不出门，难知天下事！
    车鉴之
    俗话说：“秀才不出门，能知天下事”，这是给读书人捧场的话。现在看来，这句话很不确切，我认为把它改为“秀才不出门，难知天下事”倒更恰当些。
    近来报纸上关于全民大跃进、比先进、赶先进的消息真是连篇累牍，令人兴奋不已。可是有些不出门的“秀才”，对此却感到迷惑不解，或者是体会不深。他们读了报，对这些“天下事”，在字面上也可说是“知”了，但是却无具体感受。有的人感到自己思想落后于形势，因而产生苦闷；有的人却天真地问道：“这样的快马加鞭，是不是冒进了？”对于这样的“秀才”，最好是“出门” 去看看，走马看花也好，下马看花也好，参加劳动也好，都是会有好处的。
    我虽然算不上是个“秀才”，但也是久坐机关不出门，感到思想落后于形势的人中的一个，这次参加十三陵水库劳动，才具体看到群众的革命干劲是怎么一回事。
    在劳动的第一天晚上，昌平区委一个同志向我们介绍了十三陵水库工地的情况，其中谈到民工的干劲；当区委头天刚决定兴修这个水库，第二天一清早就有几千民工自带工具和粮食来到工地。当时吃、住都很困难，作饭的锅灶没来得及准备好，住的地方地下没有稻草铺，但大家对此毫无怨言，相反的，在劳动中发挥了十足的革命干劲。那时山上没有路，天气也特别冷，很多民工都挑着双筐土找路而过，他们不是在走而是在跑，他们的口号是：一定要把十三陵水库修好！
    听了这些已经够使人感动了，但是百闻还不如一见，工地上那种活跃、生动的景象远非我这枝拙笔所能形容的。看吧，这里是部队的劳动大军在开山，那里是民工大队在轻便铁道上用斗车运土，工地上来来往往向水坝上运土的人群连绵不断。天上六级大风在刮着，吹得人站不住；尘沙飞扬着，迷得人睁不开眼睛，但是人们并没有被大风所吓倒，“一定要在山洪到来前修好十三陵水库”，这是大家共同的声音。
    机关的劳动大军也经受起了这次考验，许多同志是白面书生，从未肩挑手拿过，经过几天的锻炼以后，居然也能挑几十斤甚至上百斤的砂石走几百公尺的距离。然而，比起部队和民工来，还是相差很远。有个同志开玩笑说：“我们的劲头只能叫干劲，部队和民工同志那种劲头才能叫真正的革命干劲”。姑且不从字眼上去研究“干劲”和“革命干劲”是否是两个东西，但从这里可以看出群众的劲头是多么大。
    十三陵水库在全国建设中只是一个小的单位，但是“因小以明大”可以想见各地工厂、农村，各个建设单位，人们如何在跃进着。人，就是力量，把人的力量发挥起来，就能移山倒海，无坚不摧。而这却是久坐书斋不出门的“秀才”所难理解的。党中央指示，领导干部每年要抽出一定时间下去“走马看花”和“下马看花”，要干部下放劳动锻炼，实是叫我们这些未出过门的“秀才”出门去看看，到实际斗争中去锻炼，这会使我们眼界开阔，知道天下大事，认识群众的力量，有助于消除官僚主义和保守思想，打倒官气和官风。事实证明，秀才不出门无论如何是不行的了。
