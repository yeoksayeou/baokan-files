    I came to Dongchuan, a place of steep mountains, from a big city.
    The day before yesterday was market day. After half an hour of effort, I finally climbed the several hundred meters to Tangdan Street. In front of the street was a square of about two hundred square meters, where farmers and vendors selling all kinds of local products, firewood, and vegetables had arranged their stalls and baskets crisscrossing the ground. Miners and peasant women from the mountains in front and behind bustled around, selecting what they needed. The market day in this mountain village was full of peace, joy, and friendly, mutually beneficial transactions.
    At the end of the market, there was a basket of small, shiny, brown fruits with round, convex patterns. I thought, "These must be fresh wild fruits!" I hurried forward and rashly took one of the fruits from the basket and put it in my mouth for a bite...
    "Comrade, these are soapberries! Not for eating." A soft female voice filled my ears.
    My curiosity cooled, and shame made my heart beat rapidly. My ears and face also flushed slightly.
    The desire for knowledge finally gave me courage. When I looked up at the fruit seller, I saw a middle-aged peasant woman in patched blue clothes standing before me. She showed no hint of contempt towards me, and her eyes looked at me kindly. Her round, rosy face appeared exceptionally simple and honest; a peaceful smile expressed boundless sincerity.
    "Comrade, these are not for eating. They are for washing clothes," she told me with a smile.
    "Oh! They are called soapberries? Where do they come from?" I asked inquisitively.
    "They are also called 'bitter lotus seeds' or 'bitter lotus beads,' and they grow in our mountainous area," she told me peacefully and sincerely.
    I took out a dime and gave it to her, saying, "Please sell me some!" I then selected ten large bitter lotus seeds... When I turned around and hadn't gone far, she kept calling out, "Comrade, if you just want a few to play with, just take them! Don't need your money. These fruits are very cheap, only five cents for a big bowl..." I was too embarrassed to take back the dime and walked away with my head down.
    Lately, this little incident has constantly appeared before my eyes, making me feel ashamed, as if a force is pushing me. It is calling on me to learn from the masses more humbly.

    “苦莲子”
    吴浩培
    从大城市下放到祟山峻岭的东川来了。
    前天是集会。经过半小时的努力终于攀登上了几百公尺高的汤丹街。街的前面是一个方圆约二百平方的场子，卖各式各样土产、木柴、菜蔬的农民和小贩将摊摊、筐筐纵横地摆布在这块地面上。来至山前山后的矿工、农妇熙熙攘攘地选择着他（她）们需要的东西。这个山村的集会充满着和平、欢悦的气氛，也充满着友爱的互助性的交易。
    在场的尽头有一筐棕黄得放光而又有着圆圆凸纹的小果子；我想：“这也许是山野鲜果吧！”急忙赶上前去冒失地从筐子里拿出一颗果子放进口里咬一口……。
    “同志：这是皮皂子！不是吃的。”一个轻微的女人声音充进我的耳内。
    我好奇的心情冷却了，羞愧引起心不住突突地跳动。随着耳根和脸也微微发烧了。
    求知的欲望终于鼓起我的勇气来。当仰视卖果人的时候，在我面前站着的是一个穿蓝破衣的中年农妇，她对我确没有一点轻视的表示，两眼和善地望着我，她那圆圆而又红润的面孔显得异常朴厚；安详的笑容表现得无限的诚挚。
    “同志：这不是吃的。这是洗衣用的。”她微笑着告诉我。
    “哦！它叫皮皂子吗？是什么地方出产的？”我探询地问着。
    “它又叫‘苦莲子’或‘苦莲珠’，是长在咱们山区里的。”她安详而诚挚地告诉我。
    我拿出一角钱来交给她，说，“请你卖给我一点吧！”我随着选了十个大的苦莲子……。当我返身还未走远的时候，她不住地叫着：“同志：你如果只要几个就拿去玩算了吧！不要你的钱，这个果子很贱的，五分钱一大碗呢……”我不好意思去拿回那一角钱，垂头走开了。
    这些时，这件小事却不断地浮现在我眼前，教我惭愧，好像有股力量推动着我。叫我要更虚心地去向群众学习。
