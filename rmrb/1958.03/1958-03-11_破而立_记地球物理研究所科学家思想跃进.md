	Breaking and Establishing
	-- A Record of Ideological Leaps Forward by Scientists at the Institute of Geophysics
		By Our Reporter Cai Jianyuan

	The socialist cause is leaping forward. Scientists at the Institute of Geophysics have devoted their efforts to this great cause, and they feel gratified. However, when they recall their past work, they also feel deeply regretful about many things.

	Unpleasant Memories
	Construction is underway everywhere in the country, and scientists are needed to provide seismic intensity information. This glorious task belongs to the scientists at the Institute of Geophysics. However, some scientists took an unserious attitude toward this matter. From 1950 to 1953, they provided seismic intensity estimates for the Taiyuan area eight or nine times, with the intensity varying from VII to above X. A difference of one degree would greatly increase the state's investment. Moreover, such large variations caused serious work stoppage losses for the state at the time.

	On the surging road of the socialist cause, people in various positions are formulating long-term plans. Science has also formulated a twelve-year plan, and everyone is leaping forward. Here, some scientists, due to their conservative and backward thinking, limit themselves to working within the scope of what they knew many years ago in a discipline for which they are responsible, without considering development and improvement. Furthermore, in order to conceal their own limited level of expertise, they do not support young people in learning new skills and technologies. For example, electronics had already been applied to seismic instruments, which is a new direction. However, young scientific workers could only work "underground" because they did not receive the support of the scientists leading them.

	Some scientists regard the scientific undertaking they are engaged in as their own exclusive domain. For example, some people regard the climate research in China as their personal business. They do not adopt a cooperative attitude towards climate research conducted by others or other units. Advanced scientific countries have long applied physics to climate research, but because their strengths do not lie in this area, they oppose it. Some scientists have not conducted research or mentored students for several years, bearing an arrogant attitude of "looking around the world and thinking that I am the only one capable," unwilling to do small projects that combine with production, hoping to become famous overnight, but ultimately achieving nothing.

	Individualism Must Be Criticized
	These unpleasant memories have shaken the older scientists at the Institute of Geophysics, and the young scientific workers are even more concerned. The big-character posters put up after the rectification campaign began at the Institute of Geophysics targeted these issues, marking the beginning of a struggle between two lines of thought. Young scientific workers and some scientists requested the Party to resolve these issues. They proposed, "We hope the Party will both unify and fight." They said, "If this continues, it will harm both the scientists and the cause of geophysics." The overall situation in the institute is that, after the education of the anti-Rightist struggle, most people have clearly understood that they must take the socialist road, must pass the socialist test well, and must thoroughly criticize bourgeois individualism in order to clear the way for the leap forward in geophysics.

	But there are difficulties. Some scientists care about face, some are "not used to it," some are afraid of increasing prejudices and even maintaining superficial feelings, some consider that not exposing others' flaws can get them to not expose their own, and some are afraid of being retaliated against because they had a teacher-student relationship with the people being criticized. Many people do not understand how much harm the political and ideological errors of people can cause to the cause and to future generations.

	The Party Organization First Expresses Determination
	While setting itself on fire, the Party organization in the institute fully understood these problems and continuously conducted ideological work. Then, at a general meeting of the entire institute, the person in charge of the Party organization first made a self-criticism, expressing opinions on the scientists' issues in an extremely sincere attitude, calling on everyone to subordinate everything to the cause of socialist science. There was criticism in the self-criticism, and self-criticism in the criticism, clarifying right and wrong and distinguishing the responsibilities for the problems. This greatly encouraged the scientists to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Many people gained confidence and dispelled their concerns.

	On this basis, all senior researchers at the Institute of Geophysics began another extraordinary spring from January 11th, using gentle and subtle criticism and self-criticism to carry out the struggle between two lines of thought, the struggle between advancement and conservatism in work methods. They are demonstrating an ideological leap forward.

	Demanding Transformation
	In the conference room on the fourth floor of the Institute of Geophysics, Mr. Fu Chengyi opened his notebook and asked to be the first to conduct a self-examination. Mr. Fu Chengyi is a scientist who has made achievements in the study of seismic waves, a member of the Academic Division of Geosciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a rare senior figure in the field of geophysics. Today, he said, "After the anti-Rightist campaign, many things have come to light as my perspective has changed. Now I feel an urgent need to transform myself into a red intellectual." He believes that his consistent neglect of politics in the past is a serious problem. He also criticized his work attitude, admitting that he has serious views on fame and fortune and does not properly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective. His self-examination was considered by his comrades to be sincere and showed a determination to transform himself.

	Director Zhao Jiuzhang is Mr. Fu's old friend of thirty years. He said with emotion, "This is the first time in thirty years that Mr. Fu has so sincerely criticized himself." Mr. Li Shanbang said, "Mr. Fu's ability to conduct such a self-examination makes me feel the greatness of the Party." When scientists give Mr. Fu opinions, Mr. Fu always listens carefully, takes notes, and expresses his determination to show his commitment to change with actions. Everyone who accepts criticism has the same attitude.

	For Curing Illnesses, For Leaps Forward
	Those who criticize have the intention of curing illnesses and saving people, with the intention of making a leap forward in the cause of socialist science. When giving opinions to Mr. Li Shanbang, his assistant of more than ten years, Mr. Xie Yushou, experienced a fierce ideological struggle. Half a month ago, Mr. Xie gave Mr. Li an opinion to oppose waste, which caused unpleasantness. Now, driven by a sense of responsibility, Mr. Xie felt that he should give Mr. Li many more opinions, but he could not make up his mind. Facing Mr. Li's sincere welcoming attitude and the encouragement of his comrades, he finally put forward systematic and sharp opinions, providing many bases for everyone to give Mr. Li further opinions.

	Mr. Ye Duzheng and Mr. Zhu Gangkun originally had some "unity issues." When giving opinions to Mr. Zhu, Mr. Ye also bravely abandoned his personal grievances and, starting from caring for Mr. Zhu and the cause of geophysics, collected materials from various sources and carefully analyzed them based on Mr. Zhu's performance in his work since liberation, giving Mr. Zhu systematic and pertinent opinions. As a result, they did not "stop talking" to each other but eliminated their past prejudices.

	In these days, it can be clearly seen that the common desire of the scientists who criticize and accept criticism is: to give their hearts to the Party.

	Unveiling the Mask
	In the process of carrying out criticism, the scientists deeply felt that bourgeois intellectuals firmly wear a mask on their heads, and although the form of the mask is different, the purpose is to give people a sense of beauty. They said that in fact, the mask cannot hide the true face. To transform oneself, one must be determined to unveil the mask. Unveiling the mask went through a difficult process.

	People waited with the greatest patience. They moved all kinds of relevant materials, documents, books, journals, charts, archives...; those who expressed their opinions included Party comrades, administrative leaders, veteran scientists, people in the same profession, people outside the profession, assistants, apprentices, and so on. Using methods of answering questions, debating, calculating on the blackboard, drawing pictures, repeatedly talking about facts, reasoning, from the abstract to the concrete, from the phenomenon to the essence, from reason to emotion... In particular, through the multi-faceted performance of the person being criticized in his work, the ideological consciousness was thoroughly cleaned up. Achieve complete accuracy and perfect reasoning. Finally, the person accepting the opinion said: "Yes, I have no more opinions, I completely surrender." Relying solely on self-criticism cannot achieve this step, which fully demonstrates the greatness of the strength of the masses.

	The Views Are Consistent, and I Am Convinced in My Heart
	Mr. Zhu Gangkun once recalled: "At first, I did not accept the criticism at all and immediately rejected it. Later, I selectively accepted the opinions, listening to those that I liked, and still not being humble in considering those that I didn't like, often emphasizing my own correctness and the incorrectness of the person giving the opinion." This time, Mr. Zhu took a step forward, sincerely, deeply, and understood the opinions put forward to him by his comrades.

	Mr. Li Shanbang mentioned that some of the problems that everyone said he could not think of. He thought and thought, everyone said that, "What is going on?" He said he "got sweaty, but still did not figure it out, and felt very heavy." Some problems he thought everyone's analysis was correct on the first day, but he disagreed the next day. He said that after face-to-face debate, his views were consistent with everyone's, and he was convinced in his heart.

	Awake from the Dream, Hurry Up and Leap Forward!
	After unveiling the mask, the scientists truly saw themselves and broke into a cold sweat. Mr. Fu Chengyi described himself, saying that from his graduation from university to the present twenty-five years, "it is really a twenty-five-year dream!" He expressed the common feelings of many scientists.

	Awakening from the dream, happiness arrived. Mr. Fu Chengyi said, "My feelings with the Party are getting closer." Mr. Li Shanbang said, "I will definitely do my best and die only after I have exhausted my efforts."

	After the ideological leap forward, the scientists immediately put their thoughts into action. Mr. Fu Chengyi's specialty in the study of seismic waves has been put aside for eight or nine years, and he decided to continue his research. He expressed that he is willing to do any work that the country needs, regardless of status, and guarantees to cooperate well with others. He has not taken good care of students for many years, and now he decided to take at least four. The five-member leading group of the earthquake group could not function in the past, but now they are closely united, with division of labor and responsibility. Mr. Fu Chengyi accepted everyone's opinions and is responsible for leading the seismic record analysis group. These days he is busy meeting with young people and listening to their reports. The young people said, "This has never happened before." At the meeting of the physical climate group, Mr. Zhu Gangkun agreed that climate research should be conducted through physics. He said that he also has to start learning from scratch. In the past, they did not do a good job of collaborating with units outside the institute, and now they want to take the initiative to find relevant units outside the institute to discuss cooperation issues. The electronic seismograph developed by the young people in the seismograph group no longer needs to work "underground." In 1958, the electronic seismograph originally planned to complete only one project by the end of the year, but now it has added four more projects. Young scientific workers from various groups have reported their leap forward achievements to the rectification office one after another, expressing their confidence in even greater leaps forward. Within two days, they put forward twenty-five leap forward plans.

	The scientists at the Institute of Geophysics are using their red and expert determination as the driving force for the rapid, good, economical, and efficient development of the cause of geophysics; under their leadership, the young geophysical scientific workers are courageously boarding the train of the socialist scientific cause and galloping forward.

	Our young geophysical scientific cause, may you be blessed! Leap forward smoothly!

    破而立
    ——记地球物理研究所科学家思想跃进
    本报记者　蔡鉴远
    社会主义事业在跃进。地球物理研究所的科学家们为这伟大的事业付出过心血，他们感到欣慰；但是当他们回忆过去的工作时，对许多事情却也深感痛惜。
    不愉快的回忆
    全国到处都在进行建设，需要科学家提供地震烈度。这项光荣的任务就是属于地球物理研究所的科学家们的。但是有的科学家却对这事采取了不严肃的态度，从1950到1953年间，他们对太原地区提供过八、九次地震烈度，度数从七度变到十度以上。一度之差，国家的投资将会增加很大。而且这样多变，当时即给国家造成了严重的窝工损失。
    在社会主义事业奔腾的大道上，各种岗位上的人都在订长期规划，科学也已经订定了十二年规划，都在大步跃进。这里，有的科学家由于有保守落后思想，对自己负领导责任的一项学科工作，只限于在他多年以前知道的范围内作工作，不考虑发展和提高。又为了掩饰自己的水平不高，他不支持青年们对新的业务、新的技术的学习和建议，如电子学早已经应用于地震仪器，这是一个新方向。可是青年科学工作者们由于得不到领导他们的科学家的支持，只能在“地下”干。
    有的科学家把自己所从事的一项科学事业看作是自己独占的工作范围。譬如有人把中国气候事业看成他个人的事业。对别人或别的单位搞气候研究工作，他不采取合作态度。科学先进国家早已把物理学应用到气候研究工作中去了，由于他的长处不在这方面，他就反对。有的科学家，几年来未作研究，也未带学生，背着“环顾天下，舍我其谁”的骄气，不愿做结合生产的小题目，想一举成名，结果却没有什么成就。
    个人主义必须批判
    这些不愉快的回忆，地球物理研究所的年老科学家们受着震动，年青的科学工作者们更是耿耿于怀。地球物理研究所整改开始以后的大字报针对这些问题点起火来，显示着思想上的两条道路斗争的开始。青年科学工作者们和一些科学家都要求党解决这些问题。他们提出：“希望党既要统又要战。”他们说：“这样下去，既害了科学家，也害了地球物理科学事业。”所里总的形势是：经过了反右派斗争的教育，大多数人都已经明确了必须走社会主义的道路，必须过好社会主义关，必须彻底地批判资产阶级个人主义思想，为地球物理科学事业的跃进扫清道路。
    但是有困难。科学家们有的爱面子，有的“不习惯”；有的怕增大成见，连表面感情也维持不了；有的考虑，不扯别人的面子，可以换取别人不扯自己的面子；有的因为同被批评人有过师生关系，怕给小鞋穿。不少人不理解，人们政治上和业务思想上的错误对事业、对后代究竟有多大危害性。
    党组织先表示决心
    所里党组织在引火烧身的同时，充分地对这些问题进行了解，并且不断地进行思想工作。然后在全所的大会上，党组织负责人首先作自我检查，对科学家们的一些问题也以极诚恳的态度表示了意见，号召大家一切服从社会主义科学事业。检查中有批评，批评中有检查，明辨是非，分清了问题的责任。这对科学家们的开展批评和自我批评起了很大鼓舞作用。许多人增强了信心，消除了顾虑。
    在这个基础上，地球物理研究所全体高级研究人员从1月11日起开始了又一次不平凡的春天，用和风细雨的批评和自我批评开展思想上的两条道路的斗争，工作方法上的前进同保守的斗争。他们显示着思想的跃进。
    要求改造
    在地球物理研究所四楼会议室里，傅承义先生翻开笔记本，要求第一个自我检查。傅承义先生是一位研究地震波有成就的科学家，科学院地学部委员，是地球物理学界难得的一位前辈。今天他说，“反右派以后，许多事由于眼光变了，问题也就发现了。现在感到自己急需改造成为红色的知识分子。”他认为自己过去一贯忽视政治是个严重的问题。他在工作态度方面也作了批判，他承认自己有严重的名利观点，对个人与集体的关系摆得不正确。他的检查，同志们认为态度真诚，有着改造的决心。
    赵九章所长是傅先生三十年的老朋友，他感慨地说：“傅先生这样诚恳的批评自己，三十年来还是第一次。”李善邦先生说：“傅先生能这样检查，使我感到党的伟大。”科学家们给傅先生提意见，傅先生总仔细地听、记，并表示要用事实来表示改的决心。每一个接受批评的人都有同样的态度。
    为治病，为跃进
    批评的人们带着治病救人的心情，带着为社会主义科学事业跃进的心情。给李善邦先生提意见时，他的十多年的助手谢毓寿先生经历了剧烈的思想斗争。半月前，谢先生为反对浪费给李先生提意见，曾经引起了不愉快。现在谢先生由于责任感的冲击，觉得有许多意见还应该给李先生提出，但是他还下不了决心。面对李先生诚恳欢迎的态度和同志们的鼓励，他终于提出了系统的、尖锐的意见，使大家给李先生进一步提意见增加了许多依据。
    叶笃正先生同朱岗昆先生之间，本来有点“团结问题”。给朱先生提意见时，叶先生也勇敢地抛开个人恩怨之患，从爱护朱先生、爱护地球物理科学事业出发，针对朱先生解放以来工作上的表现，多方汇集材料，悉心分析，给朱先生提出了系统而中肯的意见。结果，他们二位不是因而“不说话”，而是消除了过去的成见。
    在这些日子里可以看得很清楚，批评和接受批评的科学家们的共同愿望是：把心交给党。
    揭面纱
    在开展批评的过程中，科学家们深刻地感受到：资产阶级知识分子的头上都牢固地佩戴着一具面纱，尽管面纱的形式不同，目的都是为了使人们有美的感觉。他们说，其实面纱是掩盖不了真面目的。要改造，就要下定决心揭面纱。揭面纱经历了艰苦的过程。
    人们以最大的耐心等待着。他们搬来了各种各样有关的材料、文献、书刊、图表、档案…；发表意见的人，有党的同志，行政领导，老科学家，本专业的、专业外的，助手、徒弟等等。用答问、辩论、在黑板上演算、画图，反反复复讲事实、摆道理的办法，从抽象到具体，从现象到本质，从理智到情感……。特别是透过被批评人业务上的多方面的表现，使思想意识得到了彻底的清理。做到千真万确、头头是理。最后，接受意见的人说：“对，我再没有什么意见，完全投降。”仅仅依靠自我批评无法做到这一步，这充分显示了群众力量的伟大。
    看法一致了，心里很服贴
    朱岗昆先生曾经回忆说：“起初，对批评根本不接受，一下就给打回去。后来，选择性地接受意见，合意的就听，不合意的仍然不虚心考虑，往往强调自己正确的一面和提意见的人不正确的一面。”这一次，朱先生跃进了一步，诚恳地、深刻地接受和理解了同志们对他提出的意见。
    李善邦先生提起，大家说的一些问题，他是想不到的。他想啊想啊，大家都那样说，“倒底是怎么回事？”他说他“弄得汗流夹背，还是没有搞清楚，心里很沉重。”有的问题头一天认为大家分析得对，第二天又不以为然了。他说，经过面对面的答辩，我和大家的看法一致了，心里很服贴。
    春梦醒来，赶快跃进！
    揭下面纱，科学家们真切地看到了自己，出了一身冷汗。傅承义先生描述自己，他说他大学毕业到现在二十五年，“真是二十五年一场春梦！”他道出许多科学家的共同心情。
    从春梦中醒来，愉快到来了。傅承义先生说：“我和党的感情接近了。”李善邦先生说：“我一定做到鞠躬尽粹，死而后已。”
    科学家们在思想跃进以后，立即就把思想付之行动。傅承义先生专长的地震波的研究已经放置了八、九年，他决定继续研究。他表示，他愿意做国家需要的任何工作，不计较地位，保证同别人合作好。他已经多年没有好好带学生，现在他决定至少带四个。地震组的五人领导小组过去无法起作用，现在他们亲密地团结在一起，分工负责。傅承义先生接受大家意见，
  负责地震纪录分析小组的领导。这几天他正忙于同青年们开会，听取青年们的汇报。青年们说，“这是从来没有过的事。”在物理气候组的会议上，朱岗昆先生同意，要通过物理学来进行气候研究工作。他表示自己也要从头学起。过去他们没有搞好同所外的协作，现在他们要主动去找所外的有关单位来商讨协作问题了。地震仪小组的青年们搞的电子地震仪，也不用再在“地下”工作了。1958年电子地震仪原只计划年底完成一项课题，现在却增加了四项课题。各组的青年科学工作者们纷纷到整风办公室汇报他们的跃进事迹，表述他们更大的跃进的信心。两天内，他们就提出了二十五项跃进计划。
    地球物理研究所的科学家们，正以红透专深的决心作为地球物理科学事业多快好省的动力；在他们的带领下，年青的地球物理科学工作者们奋勇地跨上了社会主义科学事业跃进的列车奔驰向前。
    我国年轻的地球物理科学事业，祝福你！顺利地跃进吧！
