    Anshan Iron and Steel Youth Solidarity Furnace Creates Astonishing Record in Hearth Utilization Coefficient
    Leaping into the World's Advanced Open-Hearth Furnace Ranks
    If all Anshan Iron and Steel Open-Hearth Furnaces Catch Up, Over a Million Tons of Steel Can Be Added This Year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th – The Youth Solidarity Furnace of the Second Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel created a national record in February with a hearth utilization coefficient (i.e., the tons of steel produced per square meter of hearth area per day and night) reaching 10.64, entering the ranks of the world's advanced open-hearth furnaces.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has written a letter to all the workers of this furnace, congratulating them on their achievements.
    The new record created by the workers of the Youth Solidarity Furnace of the Second Steel Plant is 3.03 higher than the average hearth utilization coefficient of other open-hearth furnaces in the plant; it exceeds the record of 10.22 created last year by the famous Youth Friendship Furnace of the First Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel; it approaches the record of 10.77 created last year by the most advanced open-hearth furnace in the Soviet Union – No. 17 open-hearth furnace of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine. If all the open-hearth furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel can achieve such results, an additional 1.2 million tons of steel can be produced on top of completing this year's production increase plan.
    Inspired by the great call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little more, workers of the Second Steel Plant put forward the slogan "Cross the Yellow River, cross the Yangtze River, surpass the First Steel Plant in everything" at the beginning of this year, setting off a wave of comparing targets and learning from the advanced. The workers of the Youth Solidarity Furnace, who increased steel production by more than 12,000 tons last year, first selected the Youth Friendship Furnace, which was ahead of all the open-hearth furnaces in Anshan Iron and Steel, as the object of their study and competition, proposing to "build a good bridge and row a good scull, determined to catch up with the Friendship Furnace." On the one hand, they repeatedly revised their production increase and savings plan, and on the other hand, they formulated a comprehensive learning plan, frequently visiting the Friendship Furnace for practice and observation, learning from the Friendship Furnace in terms of ideology, technology and systems. Thus, by the end of January, they had surpassed the Youth Friendship Furnace in terms of smelting time, utilization coefficient, and hourly output.
    In the past two months, the workers of the Youth Solidarity Furnace have increased steel production by more than 5,300 tons. (Attached picture)

The hearth utilization coefficient of this furnace reached 10.64 in February, setting a national record. If the experience of this open-hearth furnace is promoted in all open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, it will be able to increase steel production by millions of tons.

    鞍钢青年团结炉创造炉底利用系数惊人纪录
    一跃进入世界先进平炉行列
    鞍钢平炉如果都赶上，今年便可增产百多万吨钢
    新华社鞍山7日电　鞍钢第二炼钢厂青年团结炉在2月份创造了大型平炉炉底利用系数（即每一昼夜一平方公尺炉底面积的出钢吨数）达到一○·六四的全国最高纪录，走进了世界先进平炉的行列。
    共青团中央已给这个炉的全体职工写信，祝贺他们的成就。
    第二炼钢厂青年团结炉职工创造的新纪录，比目前本厂其他平炉的炉底利用系数平均高出三·○三；超过了著名的鞍钢第一炼钢厂青年友谊炉去年创造的一○·二二的纪录；接近了苏联最先进的平炉——马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合企业十七号平炉去年创造的一○·七七的纪录。如果鞍钢所有平炉都能达到这样的成绩，就可以在完成今年增产计划的基础上再增产一百二十万吨钢。
    在党中央提出的十五年或更多一点时间内在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上或超过英国的伟大号召鼓舞下，今年年初第二炼钢厂工人就提出了“跨黄河，过长江，样样赶过一炼钢”的口号，掀起了比指标、学先进的热潮。去年增产了一万二千多吨钢的青年团结炉工人，首先选择了跑在鞍钢各平炉前面的青年友谊炉，作为他们学习和竞赛的对象，提出要“搭好桥、摇好橹，决心赶上友谊炉”。他们一面一次再次地修改增产节约计划，一面制订全面学习规划，经常到友谊炉去实习参观，从思想上技术上制度上多方面向友谊炉学习。这样到1月底，他们就在熔炼时间、利用系数、小时产量等项指标方面超过了青年友谊炉。
    两个月来，青年团结炉的职工已经增产了五千三百多吨钢。（附图片）
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂青年团结炉的工人正在作快速炼钢操作。这个炉2月份炉底利用系数达十点六四，创全国最高纪录。如果鞍钢平炉都推广这个平炉的经验，将能增产上百万吨钢。
