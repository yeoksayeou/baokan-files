	Notes
	Facts are Facts
	Not long ago, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union invited representatives of the U.S. Congress to visit the Soviet Union's Supreme Soviet elections. At the time, a congressman came out and said that the United States could not accept the Soviet invitation, otherwise, it would be tantamount to acknowledging that the Supreme Soviet truly represented the will of the Soviet people.
	However, the American representatives later did go to the Soviet Union and observed the elections. Afterward, they could not help but admit that the impression they gained of the Soviet elections was good.
	It seems that these representatives gained a lot of knowledge from their trip to the Soviet Union. As for their expressing that they still "believe in the election system practiced in the United States," people have no intention of forcing them to change their minds. However, just as it is a well-known fact that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest expression of the will of the Soviet people, it is also undeniable that the U.S. Congress does not represent American public opinion at all.
	Unable to Parry
	The Soviet Union's recent proposal to prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes and to withdraw foreign military bases from the territories of various countries has been widely welcomed by public opinion in various countries. However, this has greatly annoyed some figures in Washington.
	Thus, U.S. Senator Mansfield insisted that the Soviet proposal was a "theft" of the American proposition, so that the United States was in a hesitant position.
	According to this senator, it seems that the reason why the United States is unlucky is only because its peace proposal was "stolen" by others. If this is really the case, then why doesn't the United States also "steal" the Soviet proposal to make the Soviet Union unlucky? However, the United States has never dared to do so, because doing so would not only not make the Soviet Union unlucky, but would instead make the Soviet Union very happy!
	Therefore, the nonsense of the likes of Mansfield can never conceal the real reason for Washington's distress, which is: they are struggling to parry the Soviet Union's peace initiative.
	Pitiful Legacy
	Speaking of the Nazi German concentration camps, every upright French person still harbors resentment. But today, French colonialists have inherited Hitler's legacy, establishing equally cruel concentration camps in Algeria to devastate Algerian patriotic fighters.
	But the French colonialists don't seem to have thought that since Hitler was unable to rely on his inhumane concentration camps to destroy the fighting spirit of French and other national patriots and save his own collapsing fate, how much use can some "living hells" in Algeria be to them?

    札记
    事实就是事实
    不久以前苏联最高苏维埃邀请美国议会派代表去参观苏联的最高苏维埃选举。当时有位议员出来说，美国不能接受苏联的邀请，否则，就等于承认最高苏维埃是真正代表苏联民意的云云。
    不过，美国的代表后来还是到了苏联，参观了选举。事后，他们也不能不承认他们对苏联选举所获得的印象是好的。
    看来，这些代表到了苏联一趟，增了不少见识。至于他们表示还是“信仰美国实行的选举制度”，人们倒无意相强。不过正如苏联最高苏维埃是苏联人民意志的最高表现乃人所共知的事实一样，美国议会根本不代表美国民意，也是无可否认的。
    无法招架
    苏联最近提出的关于禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的和撤销各国领土上的外国军事基地的建议，受到各国舆论的广泛欢迎。但是，这却使得华盛顿的一些人物大为烦恼。
    于是，美国参议员曼斯菲尔德硬说，苏联的建议是“窃取”了美国的主张，以致使得美国处于踌躇不前的地位。
    照这位参议员的说法，似乎美国之所以倒霉只是由于它的和平主张被别人“窃取”了。如果事实真是这样的话，那么，美国为什么不也“窃取”一下苏联的主张来使苏联倒霉呢？但是，美国却从来不敢这样做，因为那样不但不会使苏联倒霉，反而会使苏联大为高兴呢！
    所以，曼斯菲尔德之流的胡说绝不能掩饰华盛顿的苦恼的真实原因，这就是：他们对于苏联的和平倡议已是苦于无法招架了。
    可怜的衣钵
    提起纳粹德国的集中营，每一个正直的法国人民莫不犹有余恨。但是法国殖民者今天却继承了希特勒的衣钵，在阿尔及利亚建立起一些同样残酷的集中营来摧残阿尔及利亚的爱国志士。
    但是法国殖民者却好像没有想到，既然希特勒并没有能依赖他的灭绝人性的集中营摧毁法国和其他国家爱国者的斗志，挽救他自己崩溃的命运，那么在阿尔及利亚的一些“活地狱”对于他们又能有多大用处呢？
