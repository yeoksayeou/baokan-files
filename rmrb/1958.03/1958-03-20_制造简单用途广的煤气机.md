    Manufacturing Simple and Widely Used Gas Generators
    Ni Muh Han
    The ten-horsepower single-cylinder gas generator produced by Yangliuqing Machinery Factory is a kind of power machinery for rural drainage and irrigation and other comprehensive utilization, which is simple to produce, strong and durable, low in cost, and easy to use.
    The cylinder, piston, and idler wheel of this single-cylinder gas generator are all cast iron. Only the crankshaft, hook arm, and small parts use forged steel and small steel materials. The gas generator and gas storage tank are made of adobe. Each machine uses about one ton of metal, of which cast iron accounts for three-quarters, and the cost is less than 1,000 yuan.
    The gas generator is about three feet high and is built with adobe. The furnace wall is one adobe wide, the lower part of the furnace body is one and a half feet in diameter, and the top is one foot. The inner chamber is slightly curved. The inner chamber wall is smoothed with clay mixed with five or six catties of salt, and the outer furnace wall is smoothed with clay and straw. Then install the grate and furnace cover (made of iron) and it can be used. Using this furnace, it consumes an average of about twelve catties of coal per hour for twelve hours a day.
    The ten-horsepower single-cylinder gas generator can not only drive water pumps to draw water, but also drive three wooden water dragons and waterwheels with blades one foot and two inches wide. In the future, it can also be used as power for threshing and milling.

    制造简单用途广的煤气机
    倪慕韩
    杨柳青机械厂生产的十马力单缸煤气机，是一种生产简单、坚固耐用、成本低廉、便于使用的一种农村排灌及其他综合利用的动力机械。
    这种单缸煤气机的缸体、活塞、惰轮都是铸造生铁的，只曲轴、勾臂和小零件使用锻钢和小型钢材，煤气发生炉和澐气罐都是用土坯做的。每台机器使用金属一吨左右，其中生铁占四分之三，成本不到一千元。
    煤气发生炉子高三尺左右，用土坯砌成。炉壁有一土坯宽，炉身下部直径一尺半，顶部一尺，膛内稍呈弯曲形。内膛壁以粘土加上五、六斤食盐和成抹光，外炉壁以粘土和稻草抹光。然后装上炉篦子和炉盖子（铁做的）就可以使用。使用这种炉子，每天用十二小时，每小时平均耗煤十二斤左右。
    十马力单缸煤气机，不仅可以带动水泵汲水，还可用来带动三部斗叶宽一尺二寸的木制水龙水车，将来还可以用作脱粒、磨粉的动力。
