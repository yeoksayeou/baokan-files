Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, March 3rd (Reporter Liu Guiliang) reports: "The serious struggle of the Chinese working class to master the most modern technology will certainly enable China to catch up with Britain in fifteen years." This was the comment made by German Democratic Republic First Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht after visiting the Chinese Pavilion at the 1958 Leipzig Spring International Fair.

Since its official opening on the afternoon of March 2nd, the Chinese Pavilion has been one of the most popular exhibition halls here. Visitors have been streaming in from morning till night. Although the exhibition area of the Chinese Pavilion this year is slightly smaller, it is richer and more colorful in terms of variety and quality. Among the more than 3,600 exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion, most are new products from the past year, and almost all are available for export. The close combination of exhibition and export trade is the primary feature of this exhibition.

Democratic Germany's Deputy Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade, Willi Huettenrauch, said that since 1951, the eight exhibitions of the Chinese Pavilion have reflected the rapid development of China's socialist construction like a mirror. From this year's exhibition, one can clearly see the new features of China's economic structure due to the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and its increasing foreign trade capacity.

Among all the exhibits, the more than 1,000 heavy industrial products, whose quality and precision have been significantly improved compared with last year, have attracted special attention from experts, especially the 22 precision machine tools set up in the center of the pavilion—all of which are new products from China in 1957. After seeing these machines, many German experts and engineers said that the quality and precision of these machines show how fast China's industrialization is progressing.

When the reporter met Arthur Lewis, a British Labour Party member who visited China three years ago, at the Chinese Pavilion and asked him how he evaluated the Chinese exhibits, he said: "Needless to say, your traditional export goods are of great appeal to all Western European manufacturers. But what particularly surprised me was your leap in machine manufacturing." He pointed to the precision machine tools and said, "They are all first-class."

New products in telecommunications equipment have also attracted the attention of guests from various countries.

This year, the exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion are arranged in an exceptionally compact manner, focusing on the significant expansion and improvement in the variety, design, and quality of China's light industry, food industry, and handicrafts over the past year. Many visitors exclaimed "Ah! This is truly a unique Chinese style" as soon as they entered the gate. What first catches the eye of the guests are the dazzling silk, brocade, woolen fabrics, carpets, knitted goods, which are loved by European women, and the native products with a long-standing reputation in the international market, such as cigarettes, wine, tea, grain, fruits, canned goods, oils, leather, bristles, and casings. These traditional Chinese export goods have been widely praised by guests from various countries. The new products carefully crafted by Chinese handicraft artisans have also aroused great interest among a large number of visitors.

Guests from various countries carefully visited China's various gold pens with international standards with great attention. An African guest immediately inquired whether they were for sale after seeing these gold pens. When an American reporter heard that the Chinese pen-making workers were determined to make the Hero brand gold pens catch up with the American Parker 51 model in two or three years, he said he thought "this is entirely possible."

    反映出我国社会主义建设的飞快步伐
    来比锡博览会中国馆博得好评
    乌布利希副总理说：中国十五年内定能赶上英国
    据新华社来比锡3日电　本社记者刘桂梁报道：“中国工人阶级为掌握最现代化的技术而进行的严肃斗争，一定能使中国在十五年内赶上英国。”这是德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希在参观了1958年来比锡春季国际博览会中的中国馆以后所作的评语。
    中国馆从2日下午正式开放以来一直是这里吸引观众最多的展览馆之一。从早到晚参观者络绎不绝。今年的中国馆尽管展出面积略有缩小，但是在品种和质量上更加丰富多彩了。中国馆的三千六百多种展品中，不但大部分是最近一年内的新产品，而且几乎全部是可以出口的。展览同出口贸易密切结合，这正是中国馆这次展出的首要特点。
    民主德国对外与国内贸易部副部长维利·许滕劳赫说，从1951年以来中国馆的八次展出历次都像一面镜子似地反映出中国社会主义建设的飞快发展。从今年的展出中可以鲜明地看出中国由于胜利地完成了第一个五年计划而在经济结构上呈现的崭新面貌和它的日益增长的对外贸易能力。
    在全部展品中特别受到专家注意的，是质量和精密程度都比去年有显著提高的一千多种重工业产品，尤其是设置在全馆中央的二十二台精密工作母机——它们全都是我国1957年的新产品。好多位德国专家和工程师看了这些机器后都说，一看这些机器的质量和精密程度，就可以知道中国工业化的进度是多么快。
    当记者在中国馆遇到三年前访问过我国的英国工党议员阿瑟·刘易斯问他如何评价中国的展品时，他说：“不消说，你们的那些传统出口物资对所有的西欧厂商有着巨大的吸引力。但是使我感到特别惊讶的，是你们在机器制造业方面的飞跃进步。”他指着那些精密工作母机说“它们都是第一流的”。
    电讯器材方面的新产品也同样受到了各国客人们的注意。
    今年中国馆的展品布置得格外紧凑，集中地显示了我国轻工业、食品工业和手工艺品一年来品种花样和质量方面的显著扩大和提高。许多参观者一走进大门就喊出“啊！这真是中国特有的风格。”首先映入客人们眼帘的是光彩夺目、备受欧洲妇女喜爱的丝绸、锦缎、呢绒、地毯、针织品和在国际市场上素负声誉的烟、酒、茶、粮、水果、罐头、油脂、皮革、猪鬃、肠衣等土特产品。这些中国传统的出口物资受到了各国客人们的普遍赞扬。中国手工艺工匠们精心制作的新产品，也引起大批观众的浓厚兴趣。
    各国的客人们都以很大的注意仔细地参观了具有国际水平的中国各种金笔。一位来自非洲的客人看了这种金笔后立刻探询它们是否出卖。当一个美国记者听说中国的制笔工人决心要在两三年内使英雄牌金笔赶上美国派克五一型金笔的时候，他说他认为“这是完全可能的”。
