Counties Exchange Experiences, Communes Visit Advanced Models
Henan Launches Crash Program to Build Water Lifting Tools

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou) Recently, the Henan Province Water Conservancy Advanced Tool Exchange Conference held in Zhengzhou City found a way to solve the shortage of water lifting tools and the lack of labor in continuing to complete water conservancy construction tasks.

Since last winter, Henan's water conservancy construction has completed 3.6 billion cubic meters of earthwork. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, and to achieve basic water conservancy before the wheat harvest, the province plans to continue completing 3.8 billion cubic meters of earthwork. Including large-scale capital construction projects, a total of 1.5 billion labor days are needed to achieve this. However, so far, due to the lack of water lifting tools, about 50 million mu of land cannot be irrigated in time. How should these problems be solved? If we rely solely on national supply, we would need 1.25 million Liberation-style waterwheels or 1 million horsepower of water pumps, which are currently impossible to obtain. Henan Province recently held a water conservancy advanced tool exchange conference, exhibiting more than 300 models and real objects of water lifting tools, earth transportation tools, rolling tools, indigenous surveying instruments, and various cement substitutes. The efficiency of various advanced tools is generally several or dozens of times higher than that of the original old-fashioned tools. The three-sided open earth transport vehicle running on wooden rails created by Suiping County increased work efficiency by 35 times. An engineering project that used to require 50,000 laborers for 75 days was completed by only 20,000 people in 50 days. According to calculations, if work efficiency increases by 30%, the province can save 450 million labor days to be used for agricultural production.

More than eighty kinds of water lifting tools were exhibited at the conference, which were diverse and colorful. These water lifting tools fully utilized all usable power sources such as water power, wind power, manpower, fire power, and animal power; some even created many lightweight and labor-saving water lifting tools based on the physical strength of women and children.

In order to rapidly promote various advanced tools, the conference decided that before March 25, advanced tool exchange conferences would be held by county, mobilizing townships and communes to conduct visits. The conference called on the people of the province to offer suggestions and find solutions, and to promote all kinds of advanced tools to various places by early April. The conference also requested commercial departments to promptly supply the raw materials for manufacturing tools in various places, and to ensure that one million new-style water lifting tools and other advanced tools are promoted throughout the province before the wheat harvest, so that the approximately 50 million mu of land lacking water lifting tools can be quickly and timely irrigated. The conference lasted ten days and ended on the 20th.

### 县县交流经验　社社参观先进  河南突击造提水工具

    县县交流经验　社社参观先进
    河南突击造提水工具
    本报郑州讯　最近在郑州市召开的河南省水利先进工具交流会，找到了解决缺少提水工具和继续完成水利建设任务中劳力不足的办法。
    从去年冬季以来，河南兴修水利已经完成了三十六亿土方。为了保证农业大丰收，麦前实现基本水利化，全省计划继续完成三十八亿土方，加上大型基本建设工程，共需要十五亿个劳动日才能实现。但到目前为止，因为提水工具缺乏，还有约五千万亩地不能及时灌溉。这些问题应该怎样解决呢？如果单纯依靠国家供应，就需要一百二十五万部解放式水车，或者一百万匹马力的抽水机，这都是目前不能解决的事。河南省最近召开了水利先进工具交流会，展览了三百多件提水工具、运土工具、碾压工具、土制测量仪器和各种水泥代用品的模型和实物。各种先进工具的效率比原来老式的工具一般都提高了几倍或几十倍。遂平县创造的在木轨上行驶三面开口的运土车，工效提高了三十五倍，过去要五万民工，七十五天才能完工的工程，结果只两万人做了五十天就完成了。根据计算，如果按提高工效30％计算，全省可节约出四亿五千万个劳动日用到农业生产上去。
    会上展出八十多种提水工具，更是形形色色丰富多采。这些提水工具充分利用了水力、风力、人力、火力、畜力等一切能够利用的动力；有的还根据妇女和儿童的体力情况，创制了许多轻便、省力的提水工具。
    为了使各种先进的工具迅速推广，会议决定在3月25日以前，以县为单位召开先进工具交流大会，发动乡乡、社社进行参观。动员全省人民献计找窍门，并在4月初把各种先进工具全部推广到各地。会议并要求商业部门及时供应各地制造工具的原料，保证在麦收前全省推广一百万件新式的提水工具和其他先进工具，使缺少提水工具的约五千万亩土地都能迅速及时的浇上水。会议历时十天，已经在20日结束。
