After Being Sent Down
By our reporter Gu Weijin

    Ding Daobing, the deputy secretary of the Qijiawan District Committee of the Huangpi County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province, has been in Qizhan Township for several days. This is his hometown. Six or seven years ago, he was the chairman of the farmers' association here. Now the higher authorities have sent him back to serve as the secretary of the Party's General Branch. He is young, enthusiastic, and capable.

    Not long after arriving here, he heard the masses talking about him like this:

    "He's different from before! He's always surrounded by cadres."

    "Of course! Now he's the deputy secretary of the district committee. He can't be with us as often as he used to be when he was the chairman of the farmers' association."

    "This time he's been sent down, it might not be for real work, maybe just setting an example, putting on a show."

    Ding Daobing was shocked. When he lay in bed that night, he first thought about his own working methods: Since returning to his hometown, he has still maintained the "principle leadership" style of being the deputy secretary of the district committee—more transmission and deployment, less actual work, and the people he contacted did not go beyond the circle of cadres... How could this not arouse suspicion among the masses? The moon slowly declined in the west, but he still couldn't sleep. His thoughts gradually turned to this: Now, the first thing to do is to start with himself—a Party general branch secretary, every move is watched by Party members and the masses, his work style must be specific and in-depth, and he must set an example everywhere! ...

    Setting an Example, Bearing Hardships First

    The spring plowing preparations have already been deployed, but Ding Daobing and the cadres are not very clear on how things are progressing below. Ding Daobing went to the Fourth Team of the Qunli Cooperative (key cooperative) to understand the situation.

    The Fourth Team was holding a meeting to discuss the annual production plan. Not many people spoke, and the meeting place was quiet. Ding Daobing looked around at the people, most of whom looked listless. He quietly asked the women's team leader, Li Jinrong, "Why, is everyone not full?" Li Jinrong said, "Last year was a bumper harvest, there's enough to eat, there's no problem with life." Ding Daobing said, "Why is everyone so unmotivated?" Li Jinrong said, "Everyone is asking for 1,000 catties per mu of rice in the production plan, but after calculating the fertilizer account, there's a big gap, and everyone has lost confidence in increasing production."

    After the meeting, Ding Daobing suggested that the team leader and others convene a forum with experienced farmers to study the issue of accumulating fertilizer. At the meeting, everyone used their brains and found some sources of fertilizer, but they still couldn't completely solve the fertilizer shortage problem. Everyone anxiously looked at Ding Daobing. Ding Daobing thought for a while and said, "When I was in Qijiawan (where the district-level organs are located), I saw a lot of mud in the street gutters. Cleaning it up could solve a big problem." Everyone didn't say anything. Ding Daobing was surprised. After a while, Li Jinrong said, "This is a good source of fertilizer, but the mud in the gutters is too smelly, and there are many people on the street. I'm afraid no one would be embarrassed to dig it up; it's hard to mobilize people." Ding Daobing said, "When accumulating fertilizer, what's there to be afraid of being ugly! You tell everyone that I will dig with everyone tomorrow." At the moment, everyone was half-believing and half-doubting; thinking that although he was born as a peasant, he has worked in the district for many years, and his life is not very different from that of the peasants. Now he wants to accumulate fertilizer with the peasants—digging stinky mud on the streets of Qijiawan in full view of everyone, it may not be possible, right?

    But early the next morning, Ding Daobing put on straw shoes, rolled up his trouser legs, carried a newly bought manure basket, and held a newly bought iron shovel, and led the members to Qijiawan to dig mud. When the members saw him like this, they were very happy, and fifty or sixty people set off with him.

    When they arrived on the streets of Qijiawan, people surrounded them to watch the fun. Xiao Liu, a worker traveling with Ding Daobing, was a little embarrassed. He said softly to Ding Daobing, "I'm afraid this is not the way to do it." Ding Daobing said, "Why?" Xiao Liu said, "Wouldn't doing this dirty work lose prestige among the masses?" Ding Daobing smiled and said, "Not necessarily! Failing to lead the masses to increase production is the real loss of prestige!" After speaking, he was the first to jump into the gutter, move the stones away, and shovel the black, oily, stinky mud upwards shovel by shovel. When everyone saw the secretary taking the lead, they all actively started working.

    The next day, Ding Daobing found that more and more people were participating in fertilizer accumulation, not only all the cadres and general members of the team, but also some women who never participated in labor, including two old ladies in their sixties or seventies. In about two or three days, the Fourth Team accumulated fertilizer for seventy-one mu of land in Qijiawan. The team's fertilizer shortage problem was solved.

    Next, Ding Daobing went to each team to understand the spring plowing preparation situation. Like the Fourth Team, each team was still short of fertilizer in this work. Ding Daobing and the cooperative cadres studied and decided to launch a concentrated week-long campaign to carry pond mud throughout the cooperative.

    When the campaign began, the weather was gloomy, with a small north wind blowing, and cold rain and hail falling in bursts. People were so cold that they were unwilling to go out. Branch Secretary Lao Wu frowned and said:

    "Oh no! The campaign can't be carried out, what should we do?" Ding Daobing said, "The seedlings will be transplanted soon. If we don't carry the pond mud to the fields for fermentation first, it won't work. We must carry out the campaign." "But the weather is beyond our control." "Don't worry, let's think of a way." "What way?" "Cadres take the lead in carrying pond mud!" "In this weather, take the lead?..." "Yes, the more it's windy and rainy, the more cadres must take the lead!" Early the next morning, Ding Daobing, wearing a straw hat and carrying a manure basket, walked towards the pond. Lao Wu and the branch committee members followed; they cranked the waterwheel and carried pond mud, working very vigorously. When the members knew about this, they talked about it:

    "We are made of flesh just like they are, if they are not afraid of the cold, why should we be afraid of the cold?"

    "Let's do it! Light rain is like a cloudy day, and a cloudy day is like a sunny day."

    The members all went out to carry pond mud; the quiet fields instantly became lively. Every day, two or three ten thousand loads of pond mud were sent to the fields. By the end of the concentrated campaign week, the amount of pond mud carried by the entire cooperative increased from the original plan of 110,000 loads to 160,000 loads.

    Ding Daobing's leadership in mobilizing the masses to accumulate fertilizer in the Qunli Cooperative quickly spread throughout the township. At that time, the biggest problem in the township's spring plowing preparations was also the lack of fertilizer. The cadres all learned from Ding Daobing and went deep into the cooperatives and teams to lead the masses to accumulate fertilizer. A vigorous fertilizer accumulation competition campaign was launched throughout the township.

    Humbly Learning Technology

    Not long after the fertilizer accumulation competition campaign ended, the early rice planting season arrived. The weather was still very cold, and it was also raining continuously. The planted young seedlings could not withstand this natural disaster and generally appeared yellowish, or as the masses put it, they became backward seedlings. The growing period of early rice is very short, and it must be saved quickly so as not to miss the season; the way to save it is to apply topdressing—the fastest fertilizer is chemical fertilizer (i.e., ammonium sulfate).

    For the sake of applying chemical fertilizer, Ding Daobing was very distressed. He completely believed that using chemical fertilizer was very effective in saving seedlings; however, after the masses used chemical fertilizer last year, they thought it was useless. Now when they mention chemical fertilizer, the masses are not interested, and even some cadres feel the same way. Ding Daobing had explained the pros and cons to everyone more than once: There are more than 1,000 mu of backward early rice seedlings in the township. If we don't find a way to save them, we will harvest hundreds of thousands of catties of grain less in the future. But the masses are still unwilling to use chemical fertilizer. Some cadres forced the masses to use it, but it caused great resentment among the masses. Ding Daobing pondered in his heart: Are the masses so unwilling to use chemical fertilizer because it is really useless? No! The government will never promote useless fertilizer to the masses. The problem lies in the fact that he lacks a way to convince the masses! He remembered that he asked when mobilizing the masses to use chemical fertilizer several times: You said chemical fertilizer is good, what's good about it? Have you used it? Is it really useful? ... These words left him speechless. He thought over and over again: Is he really so ignorant about production? No! Although he has been separated from production for six or seven years, he still has a set of production knowledge. Didn't he lead the fertilizer accumulation campaign a few days ago? Recently, during the seedling planting period, he also helped some cooperatives to reasonably arrange labor. Some cooperatives' seedling planting did not meet the quality standards, and he also set an example for everyone to see... But now the members have raised many questions about chemical fertilizer. Why can't he answer them? Alas! His production knowledge is still lacking, especially for new technologies such as the use of chemical fertilizer, he is almost completely ignorant... Thinking about it, he felt that he could not be satisfied with past production knowledge. He must learn new production knowledge in order to lead the work!

    In order to achieve this goal, and also to save the seedlings, Ding Daobing was determined to find out the effectiveness and usage methods of chemical fertilizer.

    Ding Daobing visited the people who had used chemical fertilizer last year and asked them for their opinions one by one. At first, people still said that chemical fertilizer had no effect. However, when he visited Ding Daocai, he said with a smile, "If you say chemical fertilizer is not effective, give it to me to use." This is an old farmer in his fifties with rich production knowledge. His words cheered Ding Daobing up, and he quickly said, "Is it really effective?" "Of course! But it needs to be used properly." Ding Daocai still said with a smile, "At first, I used this fertilizer on four mu of land, and it didn't work—the yellowish seedlings never turned green. I studied the reason and found that the water in the paddy fields was too deep. The chemical fertilizer was sprinkled down and did not fall into the soil. It dissolved halfway, and the roots of the seedlings could not absorb the fertilizer well, so of course they would not turn green. Later, I made the water in the paddy fields shallower before sprinkling the chemical fertilizer. As a result, the seedlings turned green in three to five days. At harvest time, the yield per mu (about twelve mu) was also increased by 110 catties compared to ordinary fields." At that time, Ding Daobing was very happy, and immediately found two mu of paddy fields, and under the guidance of Ding Daocai, applied the chemical fertilizer he had bought himself. After four or five days, the seedlings all turned green.

    Now Ding Daobing feels that he has the right to speak about the use of chemical fertilizer! He organized all the cadres, old farmers, technicians, and activists in the township to visit his two mu of seedlings, and Ding Daocai explained the effectiveness and usage methods of chemical fertilizer. These vivid facts changed the masses' views on chemical fertilizer. More than 1,000 mu of backward early rice seedlings in the township were all applied with chemical fertilizer, and the seedlings quickly turned from yellow to green. Soon, they also caught up with the growth of first-class seedlings.

    Ding Daobing called the success of this trial use of chemical fertilizer the first lesson in learning new technology. Next, he began the second lesson: combining with technicians, old farmers, etc. to cultivate experimental fields for various crops. His new technical knowledge gradually became richer.

    Under his influence, the cadres of the entire township cultivated more than 500 mu of experimental fields. (Attached image)

    下放以后
    本报记者　古维进
    中共湖北省黄陂县祁家壪区委副书记丁道炳来到祁站乡有几天了。这是他的家乡，六、七年前，他在这里当过农会主席，现在上级派他回来担任党总支书记。他年青、热情、能干。
    来这里不久，他就听到群众这样谈论他：
    “他呀，和过去不一样了！来来往往的尽是一些干部。”
    “当然囉！现在是区委副书记嘛，还能像从前当农会主席那样，经常和咱们在一起。”
    “他这回下派，不一定是实干的，可能是带个头，做做样子的。”
    丁道炳吃了一惊。晚上躺在床上的时候，首先想了想自己的工作方法：回乡以来，自己还是带着当区委副书记的“原则领导”作风——传达布置的多，实际干工作的少，接触的人也没有跳出干部的圈子……这样，怎么不引起群众怀疑呢？月亮慢慢西斜了，他还是睡不着。他的思想渐渐转到这个上头：现在，一切的问题，首先要从自己做起——一个党总支书记，一举一动，党员和群众都在眼睁睁地望着他，他的工作作风必须具体、深入，处处以身作则呵！……
    以身作则　吃苦在前
    春耕准备工作已经布置下去了，下面进行得怎样，丁道炳和干部们都不大清楚。丁道炳到群力社（重点社）第四队了解情况。
    第四队正在开会讨论全年生产计划，发言的人不多，会场静悄悄。丁道炳环顾周围的人，多半是没精打采的样子。他悄悄地问妇女队长李金容：“怎么，大家肚子没吃饱吗？”李金容说：“去年丰收，饭是有得吃了，生活没得问题。”丁道炳说：“为什么大家那样没劲头呢？”李金容说：“大家在生产计划上要求水稻亩产千斤，可是，把肥料账算了一下，差得很多，大家都失去增产的信心。”
    散会以后，丁道炳建议队长等召集老农座谈会研究积肥的问题。会上，大家开动脑筋，倒也找到一些肥源，可是，还不能完全解决缺肥的问题。大家焦急地瞅着丁道炳，丁道炳想了一想，说：“我在祁家壪（区级机关所在地）的时候，看见街上的阴沟有许多泥巴，把它清理一下，可以解决不小的问题。”大家没有作声。丁道炳心中诧异。半晌，李金容说：“这倒是一个好肥源，就是阴沟的泥巴太臭了，街上又有许多人，恐怕谁都不好意思去挖；难得把人动员起来。”丁道炳说：“积肥么，还怕丑！你告诉大家，明天我和大家一起去挖。”当下大家半信半疑；想到他虽然是农民出身，但在区里干了多年工作，生活和农民不大一样了，现在要和农民一块积肥——到众目睽睽的祁家壪街上挖臭泥巴，未必能办到吧？
    但是第二天一早，丁道炳穿上草鞋，卷起裤脚，挑着新买的粪箕，拿着新买的铁锹，带着社员到祁家壪挖泥巴了。社员看见他这样子，非常高兴，有五、六十人跟他一块出发了。
    到了祁家壪街上，人们都围着他们看热闹。和丁道炳同行的工作员小刘有点不好意思。他低低地和丁道炳说：“这样搞，恐怕不是办法。”丁道炳说：“为什么？”小刘说：“干这肮脏活儿，不在群众中丧失威信？”丁道炳笑笑说：“不见得！不能领导群众增产，才是真正丧失威信呢！”说罢，第一个跳下阴沟，搬开石头，把黑油油的臭泥巴，一锹一锹地往上掀。大家看见书记先动手，都积极干起来了。
    第二天，丁道炳发现参加积肥的人越来越多，不仅有队里的全体干部和一般社员，还有从来不参加劳动的一些妇女，其中有两个是六、七十岁的老太婆。大概是两三天的功夫，第四队在祁家壪积了七十一亩田的肥。全队的缺肥问题解决了。
    接着，丁道炳就到各队了解春耕准备工作的情况。各队在这一工作中和第四队一样，还是缺乏肥料。丁道炳和社干部研究，决定在全社开展挑塘泥突击周运动。
    运动一开始，天气阴沉沉，刮着小北风，冷雨和冰雹一阵一阵地落着。人们冻得不愿出门。分支书记老吴皱眉说：
  “糟糕！运动搞不起来了，怎么办？”丁道炳说：“快下秧了，不先把塘泥挑到田里发酵，是不成的，一定要把运动搞起来。”“可是，天气不由人呀。”“莫急，咱们来想办法。”“有什么办法？”“干部带头挑塘泥！”“这样的天气，带头？……”“是的，越是刮风、下雨，干部越要带头干呵！”第二天一早，丁道炳戴着斗笠，挑着粪箕，往塘里走去。老吴和支部委员都跟着走；他们一边车水，一边挑塘泥，干得挺起劲。社员知道这件事情，七嘴八舌地谈起来了：
    “人家是肉，我们也是肉，人家不怕冻，我们还怕冻？”
    “干吧！小雨当阴天，阴天当天晴。”
    社员都出去挑塘泥了；静静的田野里，霎时间热闹起来。每天有两三万担塘泥送到田里。到突击运动周结束，全社挑塘泥由原计划十一万担增加到十六万担。
    丁道炳在群力社领导群众积肥的事情，很快传遍全乡。当时乡里的春耕准备工作最大的问题，也是缺乏肥料。干部都学习丁道炳深入社、队里领导群众积肥。全乡开展了轰轰烈烈的积肥竞赛运动。
    虚心学习技术
    积肥竞赛运动结束不久，到了栽早稻季节。天气还是很冷，而且阴雨绵绵。栽下的幼小的秧苗受不住这个自然灾害，普遍呈现枯黄之色，照群众的话说来，就是成了落后苗了。早稻的生长期很短，必须赶快挽救，才不致错过季节；挽救的办法是上追肥——上肥效最快的是化肥（即硫酸铵）。
    为了上化肥，丁道炳苦恼透了。在他，完全相信使用化肥对挽救秧苗是有很大的效力的；可是，去年群众使用化肥后，认为不顶事，现在提起化肥，群众都不感兴趣，甚至有些干部也有同感。丁道炳曾不止一次给大家说明利害：全乡的早稻落后苗有一千多亩，如果不设法挽救，将来要少收几十万斤粮食。但是群众还是不愿意使用化肥。有的干部强迫群众使用，却引起群众很大的反感。丁道炳心中琢磨起来了：群众这样不愿意使用化肥，是不是化肥真是不顶事？不！政府决不会把不顶事的肥料向群众推广的，问题在于自己缺乏说服群众的办法呵！他记得有好几次动员群众使用化肥时，群众这样问他：你说化肥好，好在哪里？你用过吗？真是顶事吗？……这些话，问得他哑口无言。他左思右想：自己对于生产真是这样外行吗？不！自己虽然脱离生产六七年，对于生产知识还是有一套的。前些日子，不是把积肥运动领导起来吗？最近栽秧期间，也帮助一些社合理安排劳力，有的社栽秧，杪田不合质量标准，自己也做出样子给大家看……可是，现在社员对化肥提出许多问题，自己为什么不能答复呢？唉！还是自己的生产知识缺乏，特别是对于使用化肥等新的技术，几乎是完全外行……想来想去，他觉得：不能满足过去的生产知识了，必须学习新的生产知识，才能把工作领导起来呵！
    为了实现这个目的，也为了挽救秧苗，丁道炳下决心把化肥的效力和使用方法等搞清楚。
    丁道炳访问了去年使用过化肥的人，一个个地向他们征求意见。开始，人们还是说化肥没有什么效力。可是，访问到丁道才时，他笑嘻嘻地说：“要说化肥没有效力，给我用吧。”这是一个五十多岁的有丰富生产知识的老农。他的话使丁道炳的情绪振作起来，连忙说：“真是有效力吗？”“当然有！不过需要使用得当。”丁道才还是笑嘻嘻地说：“开始，我有四亩田使用这种肥料，没有见效——枯黄的秧苗一直不转青。我研究原因，是秧田的水太深，化肥撒下去，没有落到土中，就在半途溶化，秧苗的根不能很好吸收肥料，当然不会转青。后来，我把秧田的水放浅一些，才撒上化肥，结果秧苗三五天就转青了。收割的时候，每亩田（大概有十二亩）还比一般的田提高产量一百一十斤。”当下丁道炳十分高兴，随即找了二亩秧田，在丁道才的指导下，施上亲自买来的化肥。过了四五天，秧苗都转青了。
    现在丁道炳觉得对于使用化肥有发言权了！他组织全乡的干部、老农、技术员、积极分子等来参观他的二亩秧苗，由丁道才讲解化肥的效力和使用方法。这些活生生的事实，转变了群众对化肥的看法。全乡一千多亩早稻落后苗都施上化肥了，秧苗很快由黄转青，不久，还赶上一类苗的生长。
    丁道炳把这次试验使用化肥的成功，叫做学习新技术的第一课。接着，他又开始了第二课：结合技术员、老农等培育各种作物的试验田。他的新技术知识逐渐丰富了。
    全乡的干部在他的影响下，培育了五百多亩试验田。（附图片）
