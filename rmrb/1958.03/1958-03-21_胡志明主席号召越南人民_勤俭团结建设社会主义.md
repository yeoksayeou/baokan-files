Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 20th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delivered a speech at an enlarged meeting of the Vietnam Fatherland Front National Committee on the 19th, calling on the people of the whole country to build socialism through diligence, thrift, and unity.

    Ho Chi Minh said that to carry out economic construction, one must be diligent and thrifty. If every individual, every family, every enterprise, every village, every group, and the people of the whole country can be diligent and thrifty, they will surely be able to consolidate North Vietnam and make great strides forward in the cause of building socialism.

    Ho Chi Minh said that the people of the whole country must struggle against U.S. imperialism and struggle for the reunification of the motherland, while striving to complete the task of gradually moving towards socialism. Completing the task of building socialism will provide a powerful force to fight for the reunification of the motherland.

    He said that to embark on socialism, everyone must truly unite, help each other, and make progress together. He said that true unity is both unity and struggle, learning from each other's strengths, criticizing each other's mistakes, and conducting criticism from a position of mutual care for the country and the people.

    In his speech, Chairman Ho Chi Minh also introduced to the meeting the good news that the democratic parties and non-party democrats of China recently held a congress and a grand parade, expressing their determination to sincerely follow the Chinese Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road. He asked the members of the various democratic parties of Vietnam to work hard to transform themselves and contribute their talents and knowledge to serve the people and the motherland wholeheartedly.

    Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, on behalf of all the delegates attending the meeting, assured Chairman Ho Chi Minh that the Fatherland Front would strive to complete the tasks set forth by Chairman Ho to the meeting.

    新华社河内20日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明19日在越南祖国战线全国委员会扩大会议上发表讲话，号召全国人民勤俭团结，建设社会主义。
    胡志明说，要进行经济建设，就必须勤俭。每一个人、每一个家庭、每一个企业、每一个村庄、每一个团体和全国人民，如果都能够做到勤俭，就一定能够巩固越南北方和在建设社会主义的事业中大大地向前迈进。
    胡志明说，全国人民必须为反对美帝国主义而斗争，为统一祖国而斗争，同时努力完成逐步走向社会主义的任务。完成建设社会主义的任务，就有强大的力量来为祖国的统一而斗争。
    他说，要走上社会主义，每一个人都必须真正地团结起来，互相帮助，共同进步。他说，真正的团结是既团结又斗争，互相学习彼此的长处，互相批评对彼此的错误，在互相爱护的为国、为民的立场上进行批评。
    胡志明主席在讲话中还向会议介绍了中国各民主党派和无党派民主人士最近举行大会和大游行、表示决心真诚地跟中国共产党走、坚决走社会主义道路的喜讯。他要求越南各民主党派的成员要努力改造自己和拿出自己的才能和知识，全心全意为人民和祖国服务。
