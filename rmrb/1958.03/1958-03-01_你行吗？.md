    Are You Up to It?
    A Cadre from a Beijing Institution, Hé Mù
    When Chairman Mao was at the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Research Institute, he asked the director, Comrade Lou Yuguang: "Are you up to it?" (See the People's Daily, January 27th). After reading this, my spirits were greatly lifted.
    For an agricultural research institute director not to know how to use a two-wheeled double-shared plow might not seem like a big deal to most people. However, when Chairman Mao himself uses it to plow the land and then asks the person in charge of the relevant business this question, the profundity of the question immediately becomes so clear and easy to understand. Can personnel engaged in a certain business do a good job if they lack practical knowledge of that business?
    I feel that "Are you up to it?" is a question that Chairman Mao is asking all of us cadres on behalf of the people. How should we answer it? Thinking about it, we can't help but blush.
    However, Chairman Mao's actions have also given us great inspiration. Chairman Mao, burdened with heavy work, can learn to plow the land. None of us have any reason not to learn our own business. Combining theory with practice and thoroughly understanding our own business is the most powerful answer to "Are you up to it?"

    你行吗？
    北京市一机关干部　禾木
    毛主席在浙江省农业研究所，问所长楼宇光同志：“你行吗？”（见1月27日人民日报）读后使我的精神一振。
    作为一个农业研究所所长，不会使用双轮双铧犁，在一般人看来，往往觉得不算一件什么大事；但是，当毛主席亲自使用它耕地时，再向领导有关业务的人员提出这个问题，问题的深刻性，一下就变得这样清楚和浅近易懂了。难道，从事某种业务的人员，缺乏对于这种业务的实践知识，能够作好这项工作吗？
    我觉得，“你行吗？”是毛主席代表人民向我们所有的干部提出来的问题，我们应该怎样回答呢？想一想，我们就会脸红的。
    然而，毛主席的行动，也给了我们极大的启发，担负着繁重的工作的毛主席可以学会犁地，我们任何人都没有理由不学会自己的业务。理论与实践结合，钻透自己的业务，就是对“你行吗”的最有力的回答。
