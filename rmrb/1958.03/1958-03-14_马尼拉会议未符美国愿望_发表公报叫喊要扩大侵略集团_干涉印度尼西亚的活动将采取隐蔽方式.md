Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, Manila dispatch: The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Council concluded its three-day meeting in Manila today. Information from various sources indicates that the United States, through this meeting, urged this increasingly faltering military bloc to continue advancing on the path of arms expansion, war preparation, and interference in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. However, the United States did not achieve all of the war plans it had premeditated to realize as it wished.

The communiqué issued after the meeting announced that the conference, based on the U.S. plan to strengthen the three aggressive blocs, authorized SEATO Secretary-General Sarasin to contact the Secretaries-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Baghdad Pact Organization. At the same time, the conference decided to "continue and expand SEATO's contact with non-member states" in order to gradually expand the scope of activities of this military bloc.

After announcing the continued development of military forces and the holding of provocative military exercises, the communiqué emphasized the importance of so-called "counter-subversion activities" aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries. In this regard, the communiqué echoed Dulles' remarks, openly expressing dissatisfaction with countries in the Southeast Asian region that pursue a policy of peace and neutrality.

To cope with the Asian member states' demands for economic "aid," the United States and Australia announced in the communiqué that they would provide these countries with $2 million and 1 million Australian pounds in aid, respectively.

The foreign ministers did not mention another major topic of the conference—the situation in Indonesia—in the communiqué. According to Western news agencies, citing sources participating in the meeting, the closed-door meeting held this morning once again discussed the issue of further interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. Due to the opposition of some countries, the foreign ministers decided at the last minute to delete the section on the situation in Indonesia from the communiqué, in order to avoid creating the impression of interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs in "formal occasions." However, according to Western news agencies, "senior figures" participating in the meeting admitted that the cause of the Indonesian "rebels is of course secretly supported by most countries here." These people also openly expressed the hope that the "rebels can support themselves with considerable strength for a considerable period of time" in order to manipulate political conspiracies unfavorable to the Indonesian government. The news also revealed that the meeting participants explored various possible ways to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs, including "proposals made behind closed doors" to provide the Indonesian rebels with "armed guarantees" and to smuggle supplies to them.

    马尼拉会议未符美国愿望
    发表公报叫喊要扩大侵略集团
    干涉印度尼西亚的活动将采取隐蔽方式
    据新华社13日讯  马尼拉消息：东南亚条约组织理事会今天结束了在马尼拉举行的为时三天的会议。来自各方面的消息表明，美国通过这次会议，鞭策这个日益动摇的军事集团在扩军备战和干涉东南亚国家内政的道路上继续前进；但是，美国并没有如愿地实现它预谋实现的全部战争策划。
    会后发表的公报宣布，会议根据美国加强三个侵略集团的计划授权东南亚条约组织的秘书长沙拉信同北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织的秘书长进行接触；同时，会议决定“继续并且扩大东南亚条约组织同非成员国之间的接触”，以逐步扩大这个军事集团的活动范围。
    公报在宣布要继续发展军事力量和举行挑衅性的军事演习之后，强调目的在于干涉东南亚国家内政的所谓“反颠复活动”的重要性。在这方面，公报重复杜勒斯的发言，对东南亚地区奉行和平中立政策的国家公然表示不满。
    为了应付这个集团的亚洲成员国对经济“援助”的要求，美国和澳大利亚在公报中宣布将分别向这些国家提供二百万美元和一百万澳镑的援助。
    外长们在公报中没有提到这次会议的另一主要议题——关于印度尼西亚局势的问题。据西方通讯社引参加会议人士透露的消息报道，今天上午举行的秘密会议，再次讨论了进一步干涉印度尼西亚内政的问题。由于一些国家的反对，外长们在最后一刻决定从公报中删去关于印度尼西亚局势这一部分，以便在“正式场合”避免造成干涉印度尼西亚内政的印象。但是，据西方通讯社报道，参加这次会议的“高级人士”承认，印度尼西亚“叛乱分子的事业当然受到这里大多数国家的暗中支持”。这些人士还公然表示希望“叛乱分子能够以相当大的力量支持相当长的时间”，以便玩弄不利于印度尼西亚政府的政治阴谋。消息还透露，会议参加者们探讨了干涉印度尼西亚内政的种种可能方式，包括“在密室里提出的”关于给予印度尼西亚叛乱分子以“武装保证”和向他们偷运供应品等。
