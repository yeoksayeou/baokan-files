Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 7th: Thirteen state-owned theaters, troupes, and orchestras in Shanghai proposed a friendly competition to fraternal units across the country on the 6th.

The proposal states that all those capable of writing should immerse themselves in life, everyone should start writing, and this year they should create, adapt, and organize 924 plays, 1,653 songs, 241 dances, dance dramas, and operas, 388 various musical pieces, and 53 acrobatic programs, among which 40 plays should reach a relatively mature level in terms of ideology and artistry.

The thirteen units will perform a total of 12,356 shows this year. The Peking Opera Theater, Yue Opera Theater, People's Art Theater, and Pingtan Troupe will each perform more than 1,000 shows. All units this year should spend more than one-third of their time (or shows) going to factories, the countryside, and the military to deliver good shows and good actors to the door for workers, peasants, and soldiers; and they should also work, assist, and create while performing, and everyone should make friends with workers and peasants.

The proposal also states that all units should earnestly implement the spirit of running undertakings diligently and thriftily. The Peking Opera Theater, Yue Opera Theater, Shanghai Opera Troupe, Huai Opera Troupe, People's Art Theater, Acrobatic Troupe, and Pingtan Troupe should achieve self-sufficiency this year, with most units having a surplus.

All units will also strive to have more than 80% of their personnel become leftists and middle-leftists within three years. Everyone should formulate a personal plan to be "both red and expert."

    新华社上海7日电　上海十三个国营剧院、剧团和乐团6日向全国兄弟单位倡议开展友谊竞赛。
    倡议中提出凡是能写作的，要人人深入生活，人人动笔写作，今年要创作、改编、整理剧本九百二十四个，歌曲一千六百五十三首，舞蹈和舞剧、歌剧二百四十一个，各种乐曲三百八十八个，杂技节目五十三个，其中剧本要有四十个达到思想上、艺术上比较成熟的水平。
    十三个单位年内共要演出一万二千三百五十六场，京剧院、越剧院、人民艺术剧院、评弹团等演出场次都在一千场以上。各单位今年都要有三分之一以上的时间（或场次）下厂下乡下部队，把好戏好演员送上门为工农兵演出；并做到边演出，边劳动，边辅导，边创作，每人都要交工农朋友。
    倡议中还提出，各单位，都要认真贯彻勤俭办事业的精神，京剧院、越剧院、沪剧团、淮剧团、人民艺术剧院、杂技团和评弹团今年就做到自给自足，其中大多数单位要有盈余。
