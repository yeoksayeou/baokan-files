According to the Yunnan Daily: More than 1,300 people from cultural and artistic circles in Yunnan Province held a swearing-in rally on the 18th for the socialist Great Leap Forward.

Workers in literature, drama, music, fine arts, dance, film, bookstores, publishing, and mass amateur cultural activities from the province, cities, and various special districts and counties (cities) expressed their determination to make a Great Leap Forward.

Representatives of literary workers who had been sent to work in the Lesser Liangshan Mountains and other places proposed "Pick up the hoe when working, and pick up the pen when resting," guaranteeing to produce poetry, novels, scripts, and lyrics, becoming a "one-stop shop for worker-peasant literature." Music workers proposed creating 382 songs within the year. Representatives of fine arts workers announced a plan for fine arts workers to create 500 works within the year, adopting a door-to-door approach, holding touring exhibitions in agricultural cooperatives, factories, and construction sites. Representatives of song and dance troupes across the province assured the conference that they would resolutely implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, going up the mountains and down to the countryside, going down to factories and mines, and performing in depth in the army and border areas, bringing art to the doorsteps of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Representatives of various units put forward resounding slogans at the conference, such as "Go to factories and the countryside, immerse ourselves in the workers and peasants; adopt realistic themes extensively; be self-sufficient and frugal; be full of energy, both red and expert!"
