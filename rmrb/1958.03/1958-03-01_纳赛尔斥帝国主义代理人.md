Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 27th - President Nasser of the United Arab Republic delivered another speech on the evening of the 27th, denouncing imperialism and its agents. He said: The United Arab Republic is the end of imperialism and its agents in the Arab countries, and this is the first nail in their coffin.

President Nasser's speech was addressed to a large crowd gathered in front of the guesthouse where he was staying. The speech fiercely condemned the rulers of Jordan and Iraq and refuted the recent talks about the United Arab Republic by Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rifai, Iraqi Foreign Minister Bashayan, and former Iraqi Prime Minister Jamali.

Nasser accused these people of slandering the United Arab Republic in order to "please their imperialist masters" in order to obtain dollars. He repeatedly emphasized the danger of these agents. He said that these agents were trying every means to impose the will of the imperialists on their countries. Without relying on its agents, imperialism cannot control any country.

Nasser said, "In any case, we are determined to fight these agents, no matter where they are," and they will soon be judged and punished by their own people.

    纳赛尔斥帝国主义代理人
    据新华社大马士革27日电  阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔27日晚上再次发表演说，抨击帝国主义和帝国主义的代理人。他说：阿拉伯联合共和国是帝国主义及其在阿拉伯各国的代理人的末日，这是他们棺材上的第一颗钉子。
    纳赛尔总统的这篇演说是他向聚集在他所下榻的迎宾宫面前的大批群众发表的。这篇演说激烈地谴责了约旦和伊拉克的统治者，并且驳斥了约旦副首相兼外交大臣里法伊、伊拉克外交大臣巴沙扬和伊拉克前首相贾马利等三人最近对阿拉伯联合共和国发表的谈话。
    纳赛尔指责这些人污蔑阿拉伯联合共和国是为了“取悦于他们的帝国主义主子们”，以便获得美元。他再三地强调了这些代理人的危险性。他说，这些代理人千方百计地设法把帝国主义者的意志强加于他们的国家。要不是依靠它的代理人，帝国主义就无法控制任何国家。
    纳赛尔说，“不管怎样，我们决心同这些代理人进行斗争，不管他们在什么地方”，他们不久就会受到他们本国人民的审判和惩罚。
