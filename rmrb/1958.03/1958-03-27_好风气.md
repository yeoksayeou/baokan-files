    Good Atmosphere
    In our country, various administrative departments each have independent functions, but together they form a whole, and everyone is working to complete a common general task. However, in the past, some departments, when dealing with other departments, often considered themselves more and thought less of others. For some specific business issues, they would engage in prolonged disputes. Matters that could have been resolved through mutual consultation had to be decided by higher authorities. This complicated simple problems and delayed issues that needed to be resolved quickly, affecting everyone's common general task. The reason for the existence of this departmentalism is a lack of politics.
    The Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Railways have mutually proposed guarantee conditions, thinking very carefully for others and strictly demanding of themselves, handling business issues with the demeanor of statesmen, and implementing the spirit of "politics takes command" in dealing with inter-departmental relations. This is a good atmosphere that deserves promotion.

    好风气
    在我们国家里，各个行政部门之间，既各有独立的业务，又共同组成为一个整体，大家都是为了完成一个总的任务。但是，过去有些部门在跟别的部门打交道的时候，却往往考虑自己多，替别人设想少，为了一些具体业务问题，长期扯皮，本来可以互相协商解决的事，也要上级拍板。这就把简单的问题复杂化了，把需要很快解决的问题拖延下去了，使大家共同的总任务受到了影响。这种本位主义所以存在，就是因为缺少一点政治。
    煤炭工业部和铁道部互相提出保证条件，为别人设想得很周到，要求自己严格，用政治家的风度来处理业务问题，在对待部门之间的关系上，贯彻了政治作统帅的精神。这是值得提倡的好风气。
