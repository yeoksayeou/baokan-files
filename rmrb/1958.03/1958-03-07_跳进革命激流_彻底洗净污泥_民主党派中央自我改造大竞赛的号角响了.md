Xinhua News Agency, 6th: A mass movement centered on a grand competition of fundamental self-remolding has unfolded enthusiastically in the central committees of various democratic parties. This is a new aspect emerging in the current surging national revolutionary Great Leap Forward, and it is a Great Leap Forward in the self-remolding of bourgeois industrialists and businesspeople, and bourgeois intellectuals.

Planning, Submitting Battle Orders, Expressing Determination
New Scene Appears Within Democratic Parties
In recent days, a new scene has appeared within the various democratic parties. Every day there are large meetings, small meetings, and individual heart-to-heart talks. People are busy writing letters of determination, drafting plans, and challenging and competing with each other. The letters of determination from Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Cheng Qian, and 31 others from the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) propose: loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, give our hearts to the Party, and resolutely take the socialist road. Strive to have leftists and middle-leftists account for 80% of RCCK members within three years, and basically transform the RCCK organization into a socialist party. The letter of determination submitted by Shen Junru, Gao Chongmin, and over a hundred others from the China Democratic League (CDL) similarly lists following the Communist Party wholeheartedly as the first point. They also propose striving to be both red and expert, even redder and more expert, handing over knowledge to the people without reservation, serving socialism, not caring about personal reputation or status, and subordinating all work to organizational assignments. The Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) called on organizations in various regions to lead members in launching a grand self-remolding competition, joining the ranks of the Great Leap Forward in production and construction, and striving to be transformed into laborers who are worthy of the name and self-reliant within three years. The letter of determination from Ma Xulun, Wang Shao'ao, Xu Guangping, and 32 others from the China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) states that they will always follow the Communist Party, do everything for socialism, and strive to have leftists and middle-leftists account for 80% of members within three years. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (CPWDP) wrote a letter of determination to the Central Committee of the CCP and Chairman Mao: to stand at the forefront of the movement, lead and motivate the CPWDP organization and members to accelerate self-remolding, leap from the bourgeoisie's two-sidedness to the proletariat's one-sidedness, from half-heartedness towards the Communist Party and the socialist cause to wholeheartedness, from the bourgeois standpoint to the proletarian standpoint, and strive to have leftists and middle-leftists account for over 70% of members within five years. The China Zhi Gong Party also issued instructions to local organizations, deciding to launch a grand self-remolding competition. The September 3rd Society's socialist competition letter of determination proposes wholeheartedly accepting the Party's leadership, giving our hearts to the Party, resolutely taking the socialist road, striving to contribute talents to serve socialism, and actively promoting technological innovation. Strive to have leftists and middle-leftists account for 80% of members within five years.

Live, Learn, and Work Until Old Age
Determined to be "Red Elders"
Not only are there collective goals for each party, but also specific plans for each individual. They expressed that they must plunge into this great revolutionary torrent and thoroughly wash away the mud on their bodies. Zhu Yunshan, Chen Shaoxian, Chen Qiyuan, Shao Lizi, Tang Shengzhi, Zhang Lianfen, Weng Wenhao, Zaitao, Xiong Kewu, Jiang Guangnai and other ten people from the RCCK, who are all over 70 years old, expressed their determination to be "red elders." Their letter of determination is: 1. We must be vigorous in our old age, get rid of sluggishness and officialdom. 2. We are determined to give our twilight years to the Party and socialism. 3. Live, learn, and work until old age, be a primary school student, learn from workers and farmers, transform old ideas, break the capitalist standpoint, and establish the socialist standpoint. 4. Support the policies and decrees of the Party and the state, and actively implement policies and decrees. 5. Seriously participate in the rectification movement, be promoters, and never fall behind. Zhang Zhizhong said that he is 69 years old, and he also wants to follow suit, and hopes that all the RCCK elders over 70 years old will rise up to challenge these ten elders, and strive to be redder than them. Deng Chumin of the CDL said that in the Great Leap Forward in both political and production, where the vast number of intellectuals are building up revolutionary vigor and striving to be both red and expert, even redder and more expert, he will definitely follow closely, step by step, with his old life, participate in this revolutionary battle, and is determined to fight hard. He said that although he is already 70 years old, he still wants to strive to live another 30 years and fight hard for 30 years. Mathematician Hua Luogeng said that one of the most indispensable and important links in the self-remolding of intellectuals is that everyone gives their heart to the Party, gives everything to the Party, agrees with the Party, loves what the Party loves, hates what the Party hates, and takes accepting the Party's leadership as the only guideline for all thoughts and actions.

    跳进革命激流　彻底洗净污泥
    民主党派中央自我改造大竞赛的号角响了
    据新华社6日讯　一个以自我进行根本改造大竞赛为内容的群众性运动，已经在各民主党派中央热火朝天地展开了。这是目前万马奔腾的全民革命大跃进中出现的一个新的方面，是资产阶级工商业者和资产阶级知识分子自我改造的大跃进。
    订规划　下战书　表决心
    民主党派内部出现新景象
    这些天来，在各民主党派内部出现了新景象。每天都有大会、小会和个别谈心会，人们忙着写决心书，订规划，相互挑战、竞赛。民革李济深、何香凝、程潜等三十四人的决心书上提出：忠诚接受中国共产党的领导，把心交给党，坚决走社会主义道路。争取在三年内使民革成员中的左派和中左分子达到80％，使民革组织基本上转变为社会主义性质的政党。民盟的沈钧儒、高崇民等一百多人提出的决心书，同样把全心全意跟着共产党走列为第一条。他们还提出要争取又红又专，更红更专，把知识无保留地交给人民，为社会主义服务，不计较个人名誉地位，一切工作服从组织分配。民建中央号召各地组织领导会员掀起一个自我改造大竞赛，投入生产建设大跃进的行列，力争在三年内改造成为名实相符、自食其力的劳动者。民进马叙伦，王绍鏊、许广平等三十五人的决心书说，要永远跟着共产党走，一切为社会主义，争取在三年内使会员中的左派和中左分子达到80％。农工党向中共中央和毛主席写的决心书是：要站在运动的前面，领导和带动农工组织和成员加速自我改造，从资产阶级的两面性跃进到无产阶级的一面性，从对共产党和社会主义事业的三心二意跃进到全心全意，从资产阶级立场跃进到无产阶级立场，争取在五年内使成员中的左派和中左分子超过70％。致公党也向地方组织发出指示，决定开展一个自我改造的大竞赛。九三的社会主义竞赛决心书提出，全心全意接受党的领导，把心交给党，坚决走社会主义道路，努力贡献才能为社会主义服务，并积极促进技术革新。争取五年内社员中的左派和中左分子达到80％。
    活到老学到老干到老
    决心作“红色老人”
    不仅有各个党派集体的奋斗目标，而且有各个人的具体规划，他们表示，一定要跳进这大革命的激流里把自己身上的污泥彻底洗涤净尽。民革的朱蕴山、陈劭先、陈其瑗、邵力子、唐生智、张联棻、翁文灏、载涛、熊克武、蒋光鼐等十人，都是七十岁以上的老人，表示决心要作一个“红色老人”。他们的决心书是：一、必须老当益壮，打掉暮气、打掉官气。二、决心把晚年生命交给党和社会主义。三、活到老、学到老、干到老，当个小学生，向工人、农民学习，改造旧思想，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场。四、拥护党和国家的政策、法令，积极贯彻执行政策、法令。五、严肃认真参加整风运动，要做促进派，决不落后。张治中说，他六十九岁了，他也要附骥尾，并且希望民革所有七十岁以上的老人起来向这十位老人应战，争取比他们更红。民盟的邓初民说，在广大知识分子鼓足革命干劲，争取做一个又红又专、更红更专的政治生产两大跃进中，他一定拼着老命，一个脚印一个脚印紧跟上去，参加这革命的战斗，决心苦战。他说，他虽然已经七十岁了，也还要争取再活三十年，奋战三十年。数学家华罗庚说，知识分子在自我改造中最不可缺少的一个重要环节，就是大家把心交给党，把一切交给党，和党同心同意，爱党之所爱，恶党之所恶，一切思想行动都以接受党的领导作为唯一的指针。
