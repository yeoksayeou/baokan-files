    Driving Cars with West Lake Mud
    Workers at the Hangzhou City Transportation Company have successfully used West Lake mud as a substitute for charcoal fuel. On March 2nd, they put one jin of charcoal into a modified wood-burning stove in a car to start the fire. They then added dried West Lake mud. After the charcoal was lit, the West Lake mud also began to burn. Twenty-two people were on board the car, which traveled 33 kilometers, burning more than 100 jin of West Lake mud.
    The reason West Lake mud can replace charcoal as fuel is that it contains combustible plant material. As long as the West Lake mud is dried, it can burn.

    用西湖泥开汽车
    杭州市运输公司职工用西湖泥代替木炭作燃料成功。3月2日他们在经过改装的汽车木炭炉内放了一斤木炭作引火，再加上烘干的西湖泥，点燃木炭后，西湖泥也跟着燃烧了。车上坐上了二十二个人，行驶了三十三公里，烧去西湖泥一百多斤。
    西湖泥所以能代替木炭作燃料，是因为它含有植物料可燃成份，只要把西湖泥烘干，就能燃烧。
