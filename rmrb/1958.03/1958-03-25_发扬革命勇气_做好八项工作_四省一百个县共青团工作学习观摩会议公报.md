Promoting Revolutionary Courage, Doing a Good Job in Eight Areas
Communiqué of the Observation and Study Conference on Communist Youth League Work in One Hundred Counties of Four Provinces

(I)
We, the Communist Youth League cadres from one hundred counties in Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, under the joint auspices of the provincial Communist Youth League committees of the four provinces and under the guidance of Comrade Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, held an observation and study conference in Ruijin, the red capital, from March 15 to 23, 1958. At this conference, we discussed the current situation of socialist construction in our country, studied the Party's policy of further accelerating socialist construction, and exchanged our work experiences since the Great Leap Forward.

In the past few months, our country has launched a magnificent upsurge of socialist construction. All aspects of work have developed by leaps and bounds, and some works have exceeded the achievements of previous years. Things that some people thought were impossible to do in the past have been successfully realized because the Chinese people have mustered unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm. The facts of the Great Leap Forward tell us that with the leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, and the Chinese people who have mastered their own destiny, we are fully confident of rapidly changing our country's backwardness in economy and culture. Our country is full of hope.

The facts of the Great Leap Forward have also profoundly educated us that Chairman Mao's consistent policy of overall planning, boldly mobilizing the masses, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way can generate tremendous material strength once it is grasped by the people. If our understanding of this policy was somewhat vague a few months ago, it is now relatively clear. This is the biggest gain in our thinking since the Great Leap Forward.

Now, the people of the whole country are advancing under the slogan of "Fighting Hard for Three Years to Change the Face" riding the wind and waves. We all deeply realize that we must constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and strive to overcome conservative ideas. Only in this way can we stand at the forefront of the movement, further organize the enthusiasm and creativity of young people, and better contribute to the great cause of socialism in this great time.

(II)
We unanimously believe that since the Great Leap Forward, our work has become more active and our achievements are remarkable. In this regard, we must never diminish our own prestige, but must increase our ambition.

While fully affirming the achievements, we also ask ourselves: are there still some things that could have been done but were not done? Are there still some things that could have been done faster but were not done faster? Are there still some things that could have been done better but were not done better? Are there still some things that could have been done more thoroughly but were not done more thoroughly? Our answer to these questions is affirmative.

Our work is still not good enough. As Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out in his speech, it is because we still have some unnecessary concerns to varying degrees. These concerns often put us in a contradiction of wanting to do something but not daring to do it. Therefore, eliminating these unhealthy worries is the core issue in doing a good job in the future.

One of our past unhealthy worries was that when we wanted to do something, we were always worried that the masses would not be mobilized. When the masses resolutely stood up and took action, we were sometimes shaken by some backward opinions and did not dare to move forward resolutely. For this reason, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that the contradiction between the advanced and the backward is eternal. At any time, we must represent advanced thinking. At any time, we must carefully distinguish between advanced thinking and backward opinions among the masses. At any time, we must firmly believe in the majority of the masses. At any time, we must resolutely rely on the advanced elements among the masses to lead the masses to move forward continuously.

The second of our past unhealthy worries was that when we wanted to do something, we were sometimes worried that there were no instructions from higher authorities and lacked a basis. For this reason, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that all work must proceed from reality. Any policy instruction is a synthesis and refinement of the experience of the masses. It is wrong not to work according to instructions. However, real life is vivid, complex, and ever-changing. This requires us to be good at creatively carrying out our work according to the instructions of higher authorities and constantly enrich the instructions of higher authorities with new experience. Having both discipline and creativity is precisely the true revolutionary spirit that the Party requires of us.

The third of our past unhealthy worries was that when we wanted to do something, we were sometimes worried that we had no experience and would not be able to do it well. For this reason, we must strive to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that only by doing can we increase our talents. Since experience is the practical way to do things well, if you do things successfully, you will have successful experience. If you do things wrong, you will also gain the experience of doing things again. Doing something once gives you one experience. Doing something many times gives you many experiences. Constantly doing things will constantly gain experience. If you don't do it, you won't have experience. Experience does not fall from the sky. Especially for our younger cadres, only active and courageous practice can quickly increase our talents, learn vivid Marxism, and gradually become good cadres of the Party.

The fourth of our past unhealthy worries was that we were worried that doing too much Communist Youth League work would hinder the central work of the Party. Therefore, we often simply waited for the unified deployment of the Party committee instead of taking the initiative to lead the broad masses of young people to carry out more activities. For this reason, we must deeply understand Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction on more, faster, better, and more economical. In the period of the all-round Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the Party committee's perennial central work is not one, but many. The Communist Youth League not only should, but is also fully possible to take the initiative to select some things from the Party's unified plan that young people can particularly contribute to, concentrate their efforts, and do these things well in a planned, measured, appealing, and inspected manner. This is in line with the needs of the Party's overall work and also enriches the activities of the Communist Youth League.

We have examined our shortcomings in this way, our spirits have been further liberated, and our revolutionary courage is greater. We believe that we will be able to do our work better in the future.

(III)
Based on the above spirit, after discussion, we selected the following eight tasks with universality and mass character, and are determined to "concentrate our main efforts" to do them well in the next few years.

1.  After basically completing rural water conservancy construction, leveling land and transforming low-yield fields in plain areas, and building hydropower stations and constructing roads in mountainous areas are new topics in agricultural capital construction and important conditions for further promoting rural economic and cultural development. We are determined to lead young people to be good promoters and mobilize young people to actively promote and participate in this work.

2.  Carrying out technical reform experiments centered on high-yield and abundant production is the best way to improve the technical capabilities of young people and encourage them to march towards technology, and it is also an important means to promote the technological Great Leap Forward. We must take the Communist Youth League branch as the core, unite young people, and universally establish experimental sites and experimental organizations, and carry out various experiments in cultivating grain, fruit trees, cash crops, raising livestock and poultry, and improving farm tools and farming methods.

3.  Afforestation and developing mountainous areas have a great effect on changing the natural appearance of the motherland and increasing the income of farmers. Young people can show their talents in this regard. We must further mobilize and organize the broad masses of young people to accelerate the greening movement, requiring afforestation four times a year, each time for a few days, mainly planting fruit trees, economic forests, and timber forests, and we must all become greening counties within three years. To this end, each Communist Youth League branch must establish its own nursery. We must also actively organize young mountain farming teams to vigorously develop the mountain economy.

4.  The situation of the Great Leap Forward in production requires us to speed up the pace of literacy. We must immediately revise the literacy plan, put forward a resounding slogan, and organize a literacy army mainly composed of educated youth in the countryside, so as to form a massive literacy movement and basically achieve youth literacy-free counties within three years. We must also strive to promote the popularization of primary school education and mobilize the masses to run primary and secondary schools on their own, so as to avoid the phenomenon of eradicating illiteracy on the one hand and producing new illiterates on the other, and to enable national education to achieve rapid development.

5.  Part-work and part-study is an important way for students to achieve both red and expert, it is the core issue of improving teaching quality, and it is a revolutionary measure to realize China's socialist education policy. We must do this work well and actively help all middle schools establish places for labor production in accordance with local conditions and school conditions within this semester, so that young students can gradually establish their love for labor and love for working people while studying and working, and obtain solid scientific knowledge and production technology, and strengthen their physical fitness. It is required to change all scholarships into self-study funds within two years, and then gradually achieve half or full self-sufficiency of school funds. Primary schools should also appropriately carry out part-work and part-study activities.

6.  The patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests is a major event in changing customs and transforming the country, and it can also cultivate young people's confidence and perseverance in transforming nature. We must resolutely and further mobilize young people to work hard and do it to the end, and basically achieve four-pest-free counties within three years. In order to completely eradicate the four pests, in addition to continuing to mobilize young people to carry out large-scale captures and cleanups, in cities and towns, we must also actively repair roads, dredge ditches, and transform farmers' markets; in rural areas, we must also actively build toilets, build cattle pens and pigsties, and improve environmental sanitation. We must also advocate paying attention to personal hygiene among young people.

7.  Promoting Putonghua (Mandarin) is of great significance for further developing China's politics, economy, and culture, and it is of particular importance in our four provinces. The full-time cadres of the Communist Youth League in our one hundred counties are determined to first learn to speak Putonghua within two years; it is required that students and Young Pioneers in our counties, and more than 50% of the Communist Youth League members in each county of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, and more than 30% of the Communist Youth League members in each county of Guangdong, basically learn to speak Putonghua within three years.

8.  We must vigorously improve the work of the Young Pioneers, and actively mobilize and organize the Young Pioneers to carry out planting, eliminating the four pests, talking about hygiene, speaking Putonghua, and other social welfare activities. Through these activities, we will cultivate their thinking of serving the people and their public morality, and cultivate their ability to live independently. We must also appropriately increase the Young Pioneers' gymnastics, singing, dancing, games, and other collective activities to cultivate them with good organization and discipline, as well as lively and cheerful personalities.

(IV)
We concluded this meeting with satisfaction. In order to continue to learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and make our work more, faster, better, and more thoroughly, the meeting decided to launch a socialist friendship competition among our one hundred counties with the above-mentioned eight tasks as the content, and hold an observation and study and comparison meeting once a year to conduct comparisons. Next year, our observation and study and comparison meeting will be held in Haifeng County, Guangdong. The year after that, it is planned to be held in Shanghang County, Fujian. The third year will be a general comparison, which is planned to be held in Chairman Mao's hometown—Xiangtan County, Hunan. Each meeting will be jointly hosted by the Communist Youth League provincial committees of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League will be invited to attend and guide.

All the comrades attending the meeting wholeheartedly thanked the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee, the CPC Gannan District Committee, and the CPC Ruijin County Committee for their kind help and hospitality. We also wholeheartedly thank the people and youth of Ruijin for their warm welcome and congratulations on the meeting.

Now, we bid farewell to Ruijin with reverence. The revolutionary spirit of the red capital will always inspire us to forge ahead.

    发扬革命勇气　做好八项工作
    四省一百个县共青团工作学习观摩会议公报
    （一）
    我们江西、湖南、福建、广东一百个县的团的干部，在四省团省委的联合主持下，在团中央第一书记胡耀邦同志的指导下，于1958年3月15日到23日，在红色故都——瑞金，举行了观摩学习会议。在这次会议上，我们讨论了我国当前社会主义建设的形势，学习了党的进一步加速社会主义建设的方针政策，交流了大跃进以来我们相互之间的工作经验。
    这几个月来，我们的国家，掀起了一个波澜壮阔的社会主义建设高潮。各方面的工作都有了突飞猛进的发展，有些工作超过了以往几年的成就；过去有人认为办不到的事情，由于我国人民鼓起了空前的革命干劲，也胜利地实现了。大跃进的事实告诉我们，有了伟大的党和毛主席的领导，掌握了自己命运的我国人民，完全有把握把我国在经济上和文化上的落后面貌迅速地改变过来。我们的国家是大有希望的。
    大跃进的事实又深刻地教育了我们，毛主席历年来一再提出的全面规划，放手发动群众，多快好省地建设社会主义的方针，一旦被人们所掌握，就能够产生巨大的物质力量。如果说，几个月以前，我们对这个方针的认识还有些模糊的话，那末，现在是比较明确了。这是大跃进以来我们思想上的最大收获。
    现在，全国人民正在“苦战三年、改变面貌”的口号下，乘风破浪地前进，我们大家深深地意识到必须不断地以毛主席的思想武装自己，努力克服保守思想。只有这样，我们才能站在运动的前面，把青年的积极性和创造性进一步组织起来，在这个大好时光里，为伟大的社会主义事业更好地贡献力量。
    （二）
    我们一致认为，大跃进以来，我们的工作做得更活跃了，成绩是显著的。在这方面决不可灭自己的威风，而必须长自己的志气。
    在充分地肯定成绩的同时，我们又反问自己：是不是还有一些事情可以做而没有做？是不是还有一些事情可以做得更快一些而没有做得更快？是不是还有一些事情可以做得更好一些而没有做得更好？是不是还有一些事情可以做得更彻底一些而没有做得更彻底？对于这些问题，我们的回答是肯定的。
    我们的工作还做得不够，正如胡耀邦同志在讲话中所指出的，乃是我们在不同程度上还存在着一些不必要的顾虑，这些顾虑常常使我们处在想干又不敢干的矛盾之中。因而破除这些不健康的忧虑，是做好今后工作的核心问题。
    我们过去不健康的忧虑之一，就是当我们想干一件事情的时候，有时候总耽心群众发动不起来；在群众坚决起来行动的时候，有时候又为某些落后的意见所动摇，而不敢坚决前进。为此，我们必须努力学习毛主席关于先进和落后的矛盾是永远存在的这个光辉的指示。任何时候都要代表先进思想。任何时候都要仔细区别群众中的先进思想和落后意见。任何时候都要坚信群众的大多数。任何时候都要坚决依靠群众中的先进部分，去带领群众不断前进。
    我们过去不健康的忧虑之二，就是当我们想干一件事情的时候，有时候又耽心上级没有指示，缺乏根据。为此，我们必须努力学习毛主席关于一切工作都必须从实际出发的这个光辉的指示。任何政策性的指示，都是群众经验的综合和提炼。不根据指示去进行工作是错误的。但是，实际生活是生动的、复杂的、千变万化的。这就要求我们善于根据上级的指示创造性地去进行工作，不断地用新的经验去丰富上级的指示。既有纪律性，又有创造性，这正是党所要求我们的真正的革命干劲。
    我们过去不健康的忧虑之三，就是当我们想干一件事情的时候，有时候还耽心没有经验，做不好。为此，我们必须努力学习毛主席关于只有干才能增长才能的这个光辉的指示。经验既然是把事情办好的实际办法，把事情办成功了，就会有成功的经验。把事情办错了，也会取得把事情重新办好的经验。办一次事情，就有一次经验。办多次事情，就有多次经验。不断地干，就会不断地取得经验。不干，就不会有经验。经验不是从天上掉下来的。特别是对我们比较年轻的干部来说，只有积极勇敢的实践，才能较快地增长自己的才能，才能学到生动的马克思主义，才能逐渐成为党的好干部。
    我们过去不健康的忧虑之四，就是耽心团的工作做多了会不会妨碍党的中心工作。因而往往单纯等待党委的统一部署，而不主动地带领广大青年开展更多的活动。为此，我们必须深刻地领会毛主席关于多、快、好、省的这一英明的指示。在社会主义建设全面大跃进的时期，党委常年的中心工作不是一个，而是很多。共青团不仅应当而且完全可能主动地从党的统一规划中，选择一些青年人特别能够出力使劲的事情，集中力量，有计划、有措施、有号召、有检查地把这些事情干好。这既符合党的整个工作的需要，也丰富了团的活动。
    我们是这样地检查了自己的缺点，我们的精神得到了进一步的解放，我们的革命勇气更足了。我们相信，今后一定能够把工作做得更好一些。
    （三）
    根据上面的精神，经过讨论，我们选定了下列八项带有普遍性和群众性的工作，决心在最近几年内”集中主要力量把它做好。
    一、在基本上完成农村水利建设后，平原地区平整土地、改造低产田，山区兴建水力站、水电站和修筑道路，是农业基本建设中的新课题，也是进一步促进农村经济和文化发展的重要条件。我们决心带领青年当好促进派，发动青年积极推动和积极参加这个工作。
    二、开展以高额丰产为中心的技术改革试验活动，是提高青年技术能力和鼓舞青年向技术进军的最好办法，也是促进技术大跃进的一个重要手段。我们要以团支部为核心，团结青年，普遍建立试验场所和试验组织，在培种粮食，果木，经济作物，饲养家畜家禽，改进农具和耕作方法等方面，进行多种多样的试验。
    三、植树造林，开发山区，对于改变祖国的自然面貌，增加农民的收入，有着极大的作用。青年在这方面可以大显身手。我们要进一步发动和组织广大青少年加速绿化运动，要求每年造林四次，每次几天，以种植果木林，经济林和用材林为主，一定要在三年内都成为绿化县。为此，每个团支部都要建立自己的苗圃。我们还要积极组织青年耕山队，大力开发山区经济。
    四、生产大跃进的形势，要求我们必须加快扫盲的速度。我们要立即修订扫盲规划，提出响亮的口号，组织在乡知识青年为主的扫盲大军，以形成一个声势浩大的扫盲运动，在三年内基本上实现青年无盲县。我们还要努力促进普及小学教育，发动群众自办中小学，这样，才能避免一面扫盲，一面产生新文盲的现象，使国民教育获得迅速的发展。
    五、勤工俭学是使学生达到又红又专的一个重要途径，是提高教学质量的核心问题，是实现我国社会主义教育方针的一个革命措施。我们一定要做好这件工作，积极帮助各个中学在这学期内因地因校制宜地建立起劳动生产的场所，使青年学生在一边读书、一边劳动中，逐步树立起热爱劳动和热爱劳动人民的感情，获得牢固的科学知识和生产技术，增强体质。要求在两年内变全部助学金为自学金，然后再逐步地做到学校经费的半自给或全自给。完全小学也要适当地开展勤工俭学的活动。
    六、以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，是移风易俗、改造国家的大事，又可以培养青少年改造大自然的信心和毅力。我们要坚决地进一步发动青年，一鼓作气地干下去，干到底，三年内基本上实现四无县。为了彻底根除四害，除了继续发动青年进行大捕捉大扫除外，在城镇，还要积极地整修道路、疏通沟渠和改造菜市场；在农村还要积极地修建厕所、打造牛栏猪圈和改善环境卫生。我们还要在青年中提倡讲究个人卫生。
    七、推广普通话对于进一步发展我国的政治、经济和文化具有重大的意义，在我们四省更有特殊的重要性。我们一百个县的共青团专职干部决心在两年内首先学会讲普通话；要求我们各县的在校学生和少先队员，要求赣、湘、闽各县50％以上和广东各县30％以上的共青团员，在三年内基本上学会讲普通话。
    八、我们要大力改进少先队的工作，积极发动和组织少先队开展种植、除四害讲卫生、讲普通话和其他的社会公益活动。通过这些活动，培养他们的为人民服务的思想和公德心，培养他们的独立生活的能力。我们还要适当地加多少先队的体操、歌舞、游戏等集体活动，培养他们既有良好的组织性和纪律性，又有活泼、开朗的性格。
                （四）
    我们以满意的心情结束了这次会议。为了继续互相学习，取长补短，把我们的工作做得更多、更快、更好、更彻底，会议决定在我们一百个县之间展开以上面所说的八项工作为内容的社会主义友谊竞赛，每年举行观摩学习评比会议一次，进行评比。明年我们的观摩学习评比会议准备在广东海丰县举行。后年准备在福建上杭县去举行。第三年进行总评比，准备在毛主席的故乡——湖南湘潭县举行。每次会议由赣、湘、闽、粤团省委联合主持，并请团中央出席指导。
    出席会议的全体同志衷心地感谢中共江西省委、江西省人民委员会、中共赣南区委、中共瑞金县委对我们的亲切帮助和招待。我们还衷心地感谢瑞金人民和青年对我们的热情欢迎和对会议的祝贺。
    现在，我们怀着崇敬的心情向瑞金告别。红色故都的革命精神，将永远地激励着我们奋发前进。
