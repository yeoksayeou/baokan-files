In the Great Leap Forward, it is very necessary for the leadership to promptly put forward new directions for effort in order to guide the movement forward.

Now the enthusiasm of the masses to emulate and catch up with the advanced is very high. Sometimes, an industry can produce several new records in one day. However, the main direction of the competition is not immutable. Some indicators are limited by other factors, and excessive or rapid advancement can affect quality and safety. Some industries, due to changes in circumstances, have new weaknesses or new important tasks. At this time, the leadership needs to promptly put forward new requirements to the masses and point out new directions for effort. The Paper Industry Administration Bureau did a good job in this regard. After their enterprises made significant achievements in shortening the cooking time, they promptly demanded that the focus of creating leap forward records be shifted to increasing output per unit hour. In this way, the movement will advance more comprehensively in accordance with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, keeping the enthusiasm of the masses full and preventing complacency from arising. In this way, the mass movement on the production and construction front will never lose its direction and will develop healthily forward.

    及时提出新要求
    在大跃进中，领导上及时提出新的努力方向，对引导运动前进很有必要。
    现在群众比先进赶先进的劲头非常高，有时候一个行业一天就出现几个新纪录。但是，竞赛的主要方向不是一成不变的。有的指标受其他因素的限制，过多和过快了就会影响质量、影响安全。有的行业则因情况的变化，出现了新的薄弱环节或者新的重要任务。这时候领导上就需要及时向群众提出新的要求，指出新的努力方向。造纸工业管理局就做得好。他们当企业在缩短蒸煮时间上做出了显著成绩以后，就及时提出要求：把创造跃进纪录的重点转到提高单位小时产量上去。这样，运动就将更全面地按照多快好省的方针前进，使群众情绪始终饱满，自满情绪来不及产生。这样，生产建设战线上的群众运动就将永远不迷失方向，健康地向前发展。
