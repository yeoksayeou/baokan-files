The grasp of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement as a guiding principle can unify rectification and production. It can eliminate bureaucracy, apathy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness. It can achieve results that are several times, or even many times, greater than the original plan with the same number of people and the same financial and material resources.

(News from this newspaper) The CCP Central Committee's instructions on launching the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. The full text is as follows:

The mass movement against waste and conservatism has now been launched in departments such as industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, culture, education, health, political science and law, state organs, party and mass organizations, and the military. This is a socialist great leap forward in production and culture, and it is a decisive movement in the national rectification movement to improve the work of the entire country and promote national enthusiasm. In the movement, a nationwide debate on the policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has unfolded, proving that the Party Central Committee's policy is completely correct.

The development of this movement is uneven. In many places and units, a large-scale high tide of mass movement has already formed, but many other units have not yet begun to mobilize or have not fully mobilized the masses. Many units have also failed to effectively combine the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement with the systematic rectification of ideological style. Some comrades even feel that the two urgent tasks of production and rectification are contradictory and difficult to carry out simultaneously. This idea is inappropriate. A large number of facts prove that as long as we grasp the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement as a guiding principle, lead well, arrange well, and mobilize the masses well, we can completely unify the current stage of the rectification movement with production and other work. Moreover, as long as we launch a mass anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, we can powerfully expose the harm of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism in the ideological style of some cadres, quickly eliminate bureaucracy, apathy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, further strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses, improve the awareness and enthusiasm of the masses, truly integrate cadres and the masses, and achieve results that are several times, or even many times, greater than the original plan with the same number of people and the same financial and material resources.

Therefore, the Central Committee has decided to spend two to three months to further and universally launch a movement to oppose waste and conservatism, compare with the advanced, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results throughout the country. Party committees at all levels and all Party organizations in all departments and units must grasp the leadership of this movement and pay attention to the following points:

First, the leadership must have a clear understanding. On the one hand, it must boldly mobilize the masses and adopt forms such as mass airing of views, big-character posters, great debates, on-site meetings, and exhibitions to expose and criticize waste and conservative phenomena and their harms. On the other hand, it must also pay attention to the fact that no matter how serious the waste and conservative phenomena were in the past, the achievements are still the main aspect, and shortcomings and errors are only one finger out of ten. Therefore, cadres and the masses should be guided to focus their greatest attention and energy on actively improving work and developing production, and practically eliminate waste and conservative phenomena and ideas with concrete measures to compare with the advanced and build with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Second, in the movement, we must prevent the tendency of "seeing things but not people," that is, only seeing the existing material conditions and not seeing the great subjective initiative and creativity of the masses. We must prevent only paying one-sided attention to business and neglecting ideological and political work. At the same time, we must also prevent abstract and empty talk about rectification that is divorced from the practice of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

Third, in places where the masses have not aired their views and cadres have not undergone rectification, an appropriate time should be chosen in this movement to make up for the missed lessons, that is, first let the masses criticize the shortcomings of cadres and work, and resolutely correct them to eliminate the estrangement between the masses and cadres and dispel the concerns of the masses.

Fourth, in the process of the movement, amazing miracles will continue to appear, various advanced speeds and indicators that are difficult to achieve on weekdays will appear, and various advanced models and banners will be established. The balance that was originally conceived and arranged will also be constantly broken through by the surging mass movement. We should welcome and praise the leaps forward of the masses on all fronts, promote the lagging parts to catch up, strive to achieve a new balance of movement on the basis of advancement, and review the original plans.

Fifth, some rules and regulations that were originally unfavorable to the development of productive forces will be continuously broken by the creations of the masses in the movement. We must humbly study the creations of the masses and re-examine the original rules and regulations in accordance with the needs of development and the test of the masses in practice. Anything that truly hinders the development of productive forces and can be quickly modified should be modified immediately.

Sixth, some masses have now voluntarily demanded the cancellation or change of those unreasonable wage and welfare systems. We should welcome and cherish this socialist selfless expression and enthusiasm of the masses. However, we must take a cautious attitude when actually dealing with wage and welfare issues. For those wage and welfare systems that truly hinder the unity of workers and peasants, harm the internal unity of employees, and are otherwise unfavorable to the socialist cause, we should make appropriate adjustments after careful study and approval by the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees (national ones should be approved by the Central Committee). Other than that, do not reduce the actual wages of workers.

The specific deployment and work steps of the movement shall be arranged by the party committees at all levels in various localities. The experience of the movement should be summarized and exchanged in a timely manner.

### 中共中央决定在全国进一步展开反浪费反保守运动  改进整个国家工作促进全民大干劲

    中共中央决定在全国进一步展开反浪费反保守运动
    改进整个国家工作促进全民大干劲
    抓紧反浪费反保守运动这条纲，可以把整风和生产统一抓起来，可以打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，可以用同样的人数和同样的财力、物力，办出比原定计划多百分之几十以至数以倍计的事业
    本报讯　中共中央关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示。全文如下：
    现在反浪费、反保守的群众运动，已经在工业、农业、交通运输、商业、文教卫生、政法等部门、国家机关、党群机关和军队等方面开展起来。这是一个社会主义的生产大跃进和文化大跃进的运动，是在全民整风运动中改进整个国家工作和促进全民大干劲的一个带有决定性的运动。在运动中展开了关于多快好省地建设社会主义方针的全民大辩论，并且证明党中央的这个方针是完全正确的。
    这个运动的发展是不平衡的，在很多地方、很多单位已经形成了很大规模的群众运动高潮，但是另有很多单位还没有开始发动或者还没有充分把群众发动起来。也有不少单位还没有把反浪费、反保守运动同思想作风上的系统整改很好地结合起来。有些同志甚至觉得生产和整风这两项紧迫任务，是互相矛盾、很难同时并举的。这种想法是不妥当的。大量的事实证明，只要我们抓紧反浪费、反保守运动这条纲，领导得好，安排得好，群众发动得好，完全可以把现阶段的整风运动和生产等工作统一地抓起来，而且，只要发动起群众性的反浪费、反保守运动，就可以有力地揭露出一些干部思想作风上的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的危害性，就可以迅速地打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，就可以进一步密切干部和群众的关系，提高群众的觉悟和积极性，使干部和群众真正打成一片，就可以用同样的人数和同样的财力、物力，办出比原定计划多百分之几十以至数以倍计的事业。
    因此，中央决定以两个月到三个月的时间，在全国进一步普遍地开展反浪费、反保守、比先进、比多快好省地建设社会主义的运动。各级党委，各部门和各单位的一切党的组织，必须抓紧对这一运动的领导，并且注意下列各点：
    一、领导上要心中有数，一方面，必须放手发动群众，采用群众大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论、开现场会议和展览会等等形式，揭露和批判浪费、保守的现象和它们的危害性；另一方面，还必须注意，不管过去的浪费和保守现象如何严重，成绩总还是主要的，缺点和错误只不过是十个指头中的一个指头。因此，应该适时地引导干部和群众把最大的注意力和干劲，放在积极地改进工作、发展生产方面，用比先进、比多快好省的具体措施，在实际上清除浪费、保守的现象和思想。
    二、在运动中，要防止“见物不见人”的偏向，即只看到现有的物质条件，看不到伟大的群众主观能动性和创造性。要防止只片面地注意业务，而忽视思想政治工作。同时，也要防止离开反浪费、反保守运动的实践，抽象地空谈整改。
    三、凡是没有经过群众鸣放、干部整改过程的地方，在这个运动中间，应该选择适当的时机，认真补课，即首先让群众批评干部和工作中的缺点，并且雷厉风行地加以改正，以消除群众和干部间的隔阂，解除群众的顾虑。
    四、在运动过程中，会不断出现惊人的奇迹，出现各种平日难以达到的先进的速度和先进的指标，树立起各种先进的典型和旗帜。原来设想和安排好的平衡，也会不断地被万马奔腾的群众运动所突破。我们应该欢迎和赞扬群众在各个战线上的跃进，促进落后的部分赶上去，力求在先进的基础上达到新的运动的平衡，并且审订原来的规划。
    五、原来一些不利于生产力发展的规章制度，会在运动中不断地为群众的创举所打破。我们必须对于群众的创造，虚心地加以研究，按照发展的需要和群众在实践中的考验，重新审订原来的规章制度。凡是真正束缚生产力发展而又可以迅速修改的，应该立即修改。
    六、现在已经有些群众自动要求取消或者改变那些不合理的工资福利制度。我们对于群众这种社会主义的大公无私的表现和热情，应该欢迎和爱护。但是在实际处理工资福利问题的时候，必须采取谨慎的态度。对于那些真正妨碍工农团结、妨害职工内部团结和其他不利于社会主义事业的工资福利制度，应该经过细心地研究，经过省、市、自治区党委批准（全国性的要经过中央批准），作恰当的调整，除此以外，不要降低工人的实际工资。
    关于运动的具体部署和工作步骤，由各地各级党委自行安排。关于运动的经验应该及时地加以总结和交流。
