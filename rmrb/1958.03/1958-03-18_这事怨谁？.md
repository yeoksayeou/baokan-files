A Letter to the Editor:

    The following letter is published for reference.

    After my article "This is Drive" was published in the "Everyone's Talk" column of the February 27th supplement, I received criticism from comrades. One comrade questioned me:

    "Why did you say each train pulls 3,000 tons when it actually pulls over 4,000 tons? Isn't that casually dismissing everyone's achievements?"

    I said it wasn't my fault, but everyone said, "You wrote the article, who else's fault would it be?"

    I said, "Don't be anxious, we should clarify the situation before criticizing people." One comrade hurriedly said, "I think you should clarify the situation before writing articles for the newspaper!" I said, "Pulling 4,000 tons is a current thing, a few days ago we could only pull 3,000 tons! The article was written at that time! Whose fault is that?" Then everyone said again:

    "The newspaper is too backward!"

    I said: "We can't blame the newspaper either. Think about it, today's event, after it's written, handed over to the post office, then forwarded to the newspaper, and the editors have to find it among the hundreds or thousands of letters they receive every day, then sort it out, publish it, and then wait for the newspaper to arrive here. Isn't that ten days or half a month? In this time, the scene might have changed drastically. Aren't we increasing by 1,000 tons?"

    "The whole country is engaged in the Great Leap Forward, and newspapers should leap forward even more. You can write a letter to urge them on." ......

    Editor, I have forwarded the masses' opinions to you verbatim, please use them as reference.

        Sincerely,
    Respectfully,
    Wang Fan

Editor's Note

    After reading Comrade Wang Fan's letter, we are both excited and ashamed. Comrade Wang Fan's friends are right: "Newspapers should leap forward even more!" We are now also implementing a new Great Leap Forward plan, striving to make the newspaper more satisfactory to readers. We also hope that readers will continue to support us.

    However, the Great Leap Forward in life must be ahead of the newspaper, especially the supplement. The supplement should reflect all aspects of the national Great Leap Forward with all its strength, but no matter how fast it catches up, readers will always feel it is a step behind. To not be slow, or not too slow, we can only rely on everyone to write down the ever-changing new face in a timely and rapid manner, and send it to us as soon as possible.

    In our opinion, no one should blame anyone for this, because it is a good thing, it proves that the situation is leaping too fast. Let us move forward together!

### 这事怨谁？

专栏：

    这事怨谁？
    来函照登编辑同志：
    我写的“这就是干劲”在2月27日副刊“大家谈”一栏发表后，我受到了同志们的批评。一位同志质问我：
    “为什么把每列车拉四千多吨说成拉三千吨呢？这不是随便抹煞大家的成绩吗？
    我说这并不怪我，可是大家说：“稿子是你写的，不怨你怨谁？”
    我说：“你们别急，应该弄清楚情况再批评人”。一个同志却急着说：“我看倒是你应该弄清楚情况后再给报社写稿子！”我说，“拉四千吨是现在的事呀，前几天还不是只能拉三千多吨吗？稿子是在那时写的呀！这能怨谁呢？”于是大家又说：
    “报纸太落后啦”！
    我说：“也不能怨报社，你想想，今天发生的事，等写好，交给邮局，再转到报社，编辑同志又从每天收到的几百、几千封的来信中把它找出来，等整理，发表，再等报纸来到咱们这里，可不就是十天半月的时间就过去了。在这时间里，现场说不定起多么大的变化哩。咱们这不是一增就是一千吨吗？”
    “全国都在搞跃进，报纸更应该跃进跃进啦，你可以写信促一促他们呀。”…………
    编辑同志，我把群众的意见，原封转给你们啦，请你们作参考。
        此致
    敬礼　王凡
    编者的话
    读了王凡同志的来信，我们又兴奋又惭愧。王凡同志的朋友们说得对：“报纸更应该跃进跃进啦！”我们现在也正在执行一个新的大跃进的规划，力求把报纸办得更使读者满意。也希望读者们不断支持我们。
    但是，生活的大跃进毕竟要走在报纸前面，特别是副刊。副刊要以全力来反映全民大跃进的各个侧面，可是，任凭它怎么赶，也总会被读者觉得慢了一步的。要得不慢，或不太慢，只有依靠大家，及时地、迅速地把日新月异的新面貌写下来，尽快地寄给我们。
    依我们看，这事谁也别怨谁，因为这是一件好事，它证明：形势飞跃得太快了。让我们一起往前赶吧！
