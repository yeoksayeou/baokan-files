    Miracles and Confidence

    In an ordinary county, every township has a health center, every commune has a doctor, and every team has a health worker and midwife; there is one doctor for every less than seven hundred people on average, and one hospital bed for every thousand people; the formerly prevalent infectious diseases have been completely eliminated, and rats, sparrows, lice, fleas, and bedbugs have also been completely eradicated. This is truly a groundbreaking miracle.

    Our people have created rich experiences in the long struggle against disease, but the rural health and healthcare cause in our country has never seen a flourishing scene like that in Jishan County. This organized struggle to eliminate disease is only possible after the victory of the socialist revolution. The achievements of Jishan County will undoubtedly greatly increase the confidence and courage of the broad masses in controlling the natural environment and eliminating diseases. What Jishan County can do, other parts of the country can also do. Looking at the whole country from Jishan, there is every reason to believe that everywhere will certainly be able to transform weakness into strength, and backwardness into civilization in the near future.

    The health and healthcare network of Jishan County is the direction for rural health and healthcare work in the future. This experience is worth vigorously promoting.

### 奇迹和信心

    奇迹和信心
    在一个普普通通的县份里，乡乡有保健站，社社有医生，队队有保健员和接生员；平均不到七百人有一个医生，每一千人有一张病床；过去流行的传染病已经完全消灭，鼠、雀、虱、蚤、臭虫也全部扫清。这真是破天荒的奇迹。
    我国人民在反对疾病的长期斗争中创造了丰富的经验，但是我国农村卫生保健事业从来没有出现过像稷山县那样的繁荣景象。这种为消灭疾病而进行的有组织的斗争，只有在社会主义革命胜利后才有可能。稷山县的成就，无疑将大大增加广大群众对于控制自然环境、消灭疾病的信心和勇气。稷山县能作到的事，全国其它各地也能作到。从稷山看全国，完全有理由深信：无论什么地方，一定能够在不久的将来转病弱为健强，转落后为文明。
    稷山县的卫生保健网，是今后农村卫生保健工作的方向。这个经验值得大力推广。
