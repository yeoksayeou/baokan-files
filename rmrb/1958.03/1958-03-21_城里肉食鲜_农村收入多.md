Taiyuan Food Company Entrusts Agricultural Cooperatives to Raise Cattle and Sheep

(Reported by this newspaper) The Taiyuan City Food Company has created a good method of urban-rural integration - entrusting livestock to agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs for raising. Since September of last year, the company has signed mutual support contracts with seventy-six agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Taiyuan, Yuci, Qingxu, and Yangqu counties. By the Spring Festival, these agricultural cooperatives were raising an average of 3,500 to 4,000 sheep and 2,000 to 3,000 cattle for the food company every day. This not only ensured a regular supply of fresh meat to the city but also reduced the company's large expenses for purchasing fodder, building feeding facilities, and hiring workers. At the same time, due to the agricultural cooperatives' ample feeding experience, the sheep gained more than 45,000 jin of meat within two months. More than 620 lambs were added, and the cattle also gained weight and calved in the autumn. Diseases and deaths were reduced compared to when the company raised them centrally. The agricultural cooperatives responsible for feeding the cattle and sheep, in addition to receiving more than 50,000 yuan in wages and inexpensive young livestock, also accumulated good fertilizer that could be applied to more than 16,000 mu of land.

The Taiyuan Food Company also plans to select more than 270 good working cattle to support the agricultural cooperatives in spring plowing.

    城里肉食鲜　农村收入多
    太原食品公司委托农业社代饲牛羊
    本报讯　太原市食品公司创造了一个城乡结合的好办法——把牲畜交给郊区农业社畜养。这个公司自去年9月以来，先后和市郊榆次、清徐、阳曲等县七十六个农业社签订了互相支援合同。到春节为止，这些农业社平均每天为食品公司畜养三千五百到四千只羊，两千到三千多头牛。这样，不但保证了经常供应城市新鲜肉食，还减少了公司为购买饲草、修建喂养设备和雇用工人等大量开支。同时，由于农业社饲养经验足，两个月内羊长了四万五千多斤肉。添了六百二十多只小羊羔，牛在秋季也增膘生犊，疾病和死亡都比过去由公司集中喂养减少。负责喂养牛羊的农业社，除了收入五万多元工资和廉价的幼畜以外，还积攒了可上一万六千多亩地的好肥料。
    太原食品公司最近还打算把能干活的好牛挑选二百七十多头，支援农业社春耕。
