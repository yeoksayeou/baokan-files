Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: TASS, Tokyo, March 8th: Professor Yotaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japanese Peace Committee, told TASS reporters that the Japanese people firmly oppose any intention to make Japan join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or any such aggressive group.
    He said that the Japanese people clearly recognize that Japan's accession to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or other aggressive groups would mean the deployment of American nuclear weapons and missiles on Japanese territory, which would pose a direct threat to Japan's security. The peace-loving and progressive forces in Japan are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and are always ready to defend the interests of the motherland.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Bangkok News: Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom stated to the press at a reception held at the Cambodian Embassy in Thailand on March 6th that he opposed the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    Nai Thanom said that Thailand opposes Taiwan's accession to the organization because Taiwan is not within the Southeast Asian region, and Thailand is unwilling to get involved in wars caused by the Taiwan issue. Thailand does not agree with South Vietnam joining the organization because South Vietnam is still bound by the Geneva Accords.
    Thai Acting Foreign Minister Nai Wisut also told the press on the same day that Thailand not only does not support South Vietnam's accession to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but also opposes the participation of Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, etc., because they are not located in the Southeast Asian region.

    反对日本参加马尼拉集团
    泰总理反对扩大东南亚侵略组织
    据新华社9日讯　塔斯社东京8日讯：日本和平委员会主席平野义太郎教授向塔斯社记者发表谈话说，日本人民坚决反对想使日本加入东南亚条约组织或任何这类侵略集团的意图。
    他说，日本人民清楚地认识到，日本加入东南亚条约组织或其他侵略性集团就会意味着在日本领土上配置美国核武器和导弹，也就意味着对日本安全造成直接威胁。日本爱好和平的进步力量警惕地注视着和平的敌人的阴谋，并且时刻准备着保卫祖国的利益。
    据新华社9日讯　曼谷消息：泰国总理乃他侬3月6日在柬埔寨驻泰国大使馆举行的一个酒会上向报界发表谈话，表示反对台湾蒋介石集团和南越吴庭艳集团加入东南亚条约组织。
    乃他侬说，泰国反对台湾加入这个组织的原因是：台湾并不在东南亚区域内，泰国不愿意介入由台湾问题引起的战争。泰国不赞同南越加入这个组织，是因为南越目前仍须受日内瓦协议的约束。
    泰国代外交部长乃威戍同一天也向报界发表谈话说，泰国不但不支持南越加入东南亚条约组织，而且反对台湾、日本、南朝鲜等参加，因为它们并非处在东南亚区域内。
