    The Characteristics and Practice of Taijiquan
    Gu Liuxin
    Taijiquan, which has been popular in China for nearly fifty years, is a martial arts sport with a long history and rich national style. It has gradually transformed from a boxing routine that focused on combativeness when it was created three hundred years ago to a boxing routine with the basic functions of treating diseases, maintaining health, preventing premature aging, and prolonging life, in accordance with the different needs of the times.
    Taijiquan has considerable value in medical treatment. The exercise method of Taijiquan is holistic and unified internally and externally. It has a good influence on the central nervous system of practitioners, strengthens the function of the respiratory, digestive, and excretory organs, enhances blood circulation and cardiac contraction function, promotes metabolism, and activates various joints and muscle groups. Therefore, Taijiquan can play a certain therapeutic role in various chronic diseases such as neurasthenia, neuralgia, heart disease, gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, rheumatism, and cold leg arthritis. Now, the medical community has generally recognized that Taijiquan is a necessary medical sports exercise in functional therapy.
    From an artistic point of view, Taijiquan is a beautiful dance art. The movements of Taijiquan are gentle, complete, continuous, and rounded, so the image is beautiful, combining strength and softness, and full of rhythm. After practicing proficiently, it is lively and light, soft but firm, like a willow in the wind, making people feel relaxed and happy like flowing clouds and flowing water.
    In terms of fighting methods, Taijiquan conforms to the principles of mechanics. The double push-hands created by Taijiquan practitioners use the methods of sticking, connecting, adhering, and following, and not losing or resisting, to understand the direction, size, and speed of the opponent's force, thereby diverting the opponent's strength, shaking the opponent's center of gravity, and then finding the right point of force to counterattack, achieving the purpose of overcoming the strong with the weak, controlling the back with the compliant, and avoiding the solid and attacking the empty. The movements and methods of Taijiquan are completely in line with the principles of mechanics. When it develops to the stage of live-step push-hands and free sparring, the body feels sensitive, the movements are closely linked, and it can play an active competitive role. Therefore, Taijiquan is an advanced boxing technique full of fighting spirit, flexible and mobile, and combining strength and softness.
    The main principle of practicing Taijiquan is to always use consciousness to guide the movements. During practice, the whole body should be relaxed and soft, and gradually coordinate breathing with the movements. The movements should rotate in a circular shape, with the limbs moving with the rotation of the waist. The movements should be uniform and continuous. The torso should be upright and not tilted. The top of the head and the tailbone should be kept in a straight line, avoiding chest puffing, belly protrusion, bending over, and exposing the buttocks. The eyes should follow the movement of the hands and look forward, with the shoulders drooping and elbows sinking, so that the body is stable below and flexible above. One move should follow another, becoming more and more relaxed and slower as you practice, so that breathing gradually becomes deep and long, and physical strength gradually increases. First seek expansion, then compactness; first seek softness, then firmness, to achieve a combination of strength and softness. When practicing, the height of the posture, whether high, medium, or low, should be determined according to the practitioner's physical strength and level of proficiency. No matter what posture, it should always be kept at one level, and should not be suddenly high or low.
    The amount of exercise in practicing Taijiquan should be adjusted according to the physical conditions of the learner. The teacher should teach according to the student's aptitude and set the pace. The learner should do what they can and proceed gradually. As a medical and health exercise, practicing Taijiquan should be based on the principles of being relaxed, comfortable, and natural, and it is enough to practice until you sweat slightly.
    Beginners in Taijiquan should pay attention to correct exercise methods, and the posture must be correct. It is best to have a teacher demonstrate and guide, so that the results will be faster.
    Taijiquan is a very good sports program for health care and disease treatment, and it should be promoted, especially among mental workers and the elderly and infirm.

    太极拳的特点和练法
    顾留馨
    近五十年来在国内流行的太极拳是一项历史悠久、富于民族风格的武术体育运动，它已从三百年前创造时偏重于技击性的拳套，随着时代的需要不同，逐渐转化为以疗病、保健、防止早衰和延年益寿为基本功能的拳套。
    太极拳在医疗上有不小的价值。太极拳的锻炼方法是整体的、内外统一的，它对练习者的中枢神经系统有良好影响，能加强呼吸、消化和排泄器官的作用，增强血液循环和心脏收缩机能，促进新陈代谢作用，活动各个关节和肌肉群。因此太极拳对各种慢性病如：神经衰弱、神经痛、心脏病、胃肠炎、肺痨、风湿、寒腿关节炎等，都能起一定的医疗作用。现在，医药界已公认在机能治疗中，太极拳是一项必要的医疗体育运动。
    从艺术形象来看，太极拳是一种优美的舞蹈艺术。太极拳的动作柔和、完整、连贯、圆活，因此形象优美、刚柔相济、富有韵律性。练熟了以后，活泼轻灵，柔中有刚，好像风中杨柳，行云流水般地使人感到轻松愉快。
    在技击方法上，太极拳合乎力学上的原理。太极拳家创造的双人推手，运用沾、连、粘、随和不丢、不顶的方法，来了解对方用力的方向、大小、快慢等等，从而把对方的力量引开，摇动对方的重心，然后找准力点，进行反击，达到以小力胜大力，以顺制背，避实击虚的目的。太极拳的动作和方法完全合乎力学原理。当发展到活步推手和散手的阶段时，肌体感觉灵敏，动作丝丝入扣，可以发挥积极的竞技作用。因此太极拳是充满着斗争精神的、机动灵活的、刚柔互用的高级拳术。
    练太极拳的主要原则是：始终用意识指导动作。练时要混身松柔，并逐渐作到呼吸同动作配合起来。动作旋转作环形，四肢随腰转动，动作要均匀、连贯。躯干要正直不偏。头顶同尾闾保持一条直线，避免挺胸、突肚、弯腰、露臀。要目光随手转动而前视，垂肩沉肘，使身体下稳重，上灵活。一个招势要接着一个招势，愈练愈松，愈慢，使呼吸逐渐深长，体力逐渐增强。先求开展，后求紧凑；先求松柔，后求坚刚，达到刚柔相济。练时，架子的高、中、低，要根据练的人的体力和熟练程度来决定，无论什么架子，都要始终保持一个水平，不要忽高忽低。
    练太极拳的运动量的大小，应根据学的人的体力条件作调整，教的人应该因材施教，规定进度；学的人应该量力而行，循序渐进。作为医疗保健的体育运动，练太极拳应该以轻松、舒服、自然为原则，练到稍为出汗就够了。
    初学太极拳的人要注意正确的锻炼方法，姿势一定要求正确。最好能有教师示范指导，那样收效比较快。
    太极拳是一项很好的保健疗病的体育项目，应该推广，特别是在脑力劳动者和年老、体弱人中间。
