Eight Big-Character Poster Poems
    Xing Ye

    Workers are Lightning
	Even if the advanced flies up the mountain,
	Even if it goes to heaven!
	If you say catch up, we'll catch up,
	Workers are lightning!

    Good Big Fire
	Against waste, good big fire!
	Burning until we're dripping with sweat,
	Burning until the rivers and lakes boil,
	Let's see who sneaks and hides!
	Good big fire, good big fire!
	We want to collect piles of gold and silver,
	We want to refine away official airs,
	Refine them into truly revolutionary people!

    Party Committee Secretary
	--Notes on the workers' discussions
	"Our Secretary is surnamed Hou,
	The old master is also surnamed Hou.
	We often see the master looking for the secretary,
	And also see the secretary looking for the old man.
	The old man looks a lot like the secretary,
	The secretary looks even more like the old man."

    "Don't Ask"
	There's a Master Wang,
	Also named "Don't Ask".
	Don't ask what?
	"Ten years without absence."
	If someone insists on asking,
	He'll retort sharply:
	"Don't ask me,
	Ask your own heart!"

    To Our Farmer Brothers
	You bear the full sky of stars,
	We put on the red of the sun,
	Then we can travel a thousand *li* a day,
	And eight hundred *li* at night without stopping!

    I am a Certificate
	Bad thoughts don't speak,
	Good "waste materials" speak up:
	"Who wants to play dumb,
	I am a certificate!"

    Reply to the Downward Transferred Comrades
	Downward transfer, downward transfer,
	Sweat is downward transferred!
	You put it in the fields and mud,
	I put it in the sound of machines.
	Upward transfer, upward transfer,
	Ambition is upward transferred!
	You put it in the clouds in the sky,
	I put it on the tip of the water tower.

    Hold On
	"Socialist
	Checkpoint here!"
	People who constantly make revolution,
	People who bravely innovate,
	People who leap forward,
	Please enter!
	People who are satisfied with the status quo,
	People who stubbornly stick to the rules,
	People who oppose "rash advance,"
	Hold on!

  (1958, 2, Shijiazhuang)

    大字报诗八首
    邢野
    工人是闪电哪怕先进飞上山，哪怕它又上了天！说赶就赶上，工人是闪电！
    好大火反浪费，好大火！烧得混身冒汗，烧得江河开锅，看谁闪闪躲躲！好大火，好大火！要收金银成垛，要把官气炼没，炼成真心革命者！
    党委书记
    ——记工人们的议论
  “咱们书记姓侯，老师父也姓侯。常见师父找书记，也见书记找老头。老头很像书记，书记更像老头。”
  “快别问”有个王师父，又名“快别问”。别问什么事？“十年不缺勤。”有人偏要问，他就刺答人：“你们别问我，问问自己的心！”
    给农民兄弟你们顶着满天星，我们披上太阳红，就能日行千里路，夜走八百也不停！
    我是证件坏思想不说话，好“废料”发了言：“谁要装傻，我是证件！”
    答下放同志下放，下放，汗水下放！你放进田野泥土，我放进机器声响。上放，上放，志气上放！你放在天空云朵，我放在水塔尖上。
    且慢“社会主义
  关口在此！”不断革命的人，勇敢革新的人，飞跃前进的人，请进！满足现状的人，死守常规的人，反对“冒进”的人，且慢！
  （1958、2、石家庄）
