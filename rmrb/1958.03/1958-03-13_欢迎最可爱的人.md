    Welcome the Most Beloved People

    The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers issued a communique on March 12, announcing the specific steps for the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. According to this plan, the Chinese People's Volunteers will be completely withdrawn from Korea in three batches before the end of this year. The first batch of six divisions will begin to withdraw to the motherland on March 15 and will be completed before April 30. The Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw from Korea is to seek to break the deadlock currently created by the United States in Korea, promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and strive to further ease tensions in the Far East. This is a glorious peace action.

    The news of the Chinese People's Volunteers' decision to proactively withdraw from Korea has already caused a sensation around the world. All peace-loving countries and people believe that the Chinese People's Volunteers' complete withdrawal from Korea is an important contribution to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the easing of international tensions, and also poses a serious test to the United States and other countries with troops stationed in South Korea. However, since the governments of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union successively issued statements on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the United States, in order to conceal its current predicament on the Korean issue, has been spreading blatant lies to the world, accusing the Korean and Chinese sides of lacking sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, attempting to diminish the significance of the various proposals put forward by the Korean, Chinese, and Soviet governments regarding the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and stubbornly claiming that the peaceful measures of the Chinese People's Volunteers to proactively withdraw from Korea are merely for "propaganda." Now, these absurd arguments of the United States have not only been shattered by the actual actions of the Chinese People's Volunteers beginning to withdraw from Korea, but will only put the United States in a more embarrassing position on the Korean issue.

    At a time when the Chinese People's Volunteers, based on the suggestions of the Chinese and Korean governments, have decided to proactively withdraw completely from Korea and have already begun to take practical actions, the United States is facing an increasingly unavoidable obligation on the Korean issue. This is: the United States and other countries with troops in South Korea should take similar measures and withdraw all their troops from South Korea without delay. Because only when all foreign troops are withdrawn from Korea can the Korean people conduct free elections according to their own will without foreign interference and realize the reunification of their long-desired motherland. If the United States continues to refuse to withdraw its invading troops, it will never be able to get rid of the serious responsibility for dividing Korea and will face increasingly strong opposition from the Korean people and increasingly severe condemnation from world public opinion. According to Western news agency reports, the recent meeting in Washington where the United States brought together sixteen countries participating in the Korean War shows that some countries with troops in South Korea have recognized this unfavorable situation for them and therefore do not fully agree with the rigid attitude currently adopted by the United States on the Korean issue. This further illustrates that the U.S. ruling clique should now be making a wise choice.

    The glorious Chinese People's Volunteers have been fighting alongside the Korean people and the Korean People's Army since October 25, 1950, when they entered Korea to resist the aggression of American imperialism, and it has now been seven years and four months. During these seven years, they have victoriously completed the glorious and sacred mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and defending their homes and their country, and have made immortal contributions to the peace cause of the Chinese and Korean people and the world. The Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, under extremely difficult conditions, confronted a brutal enemy rarely seen in history. After three years of heroic and extraordinary struggle, they finally drove the sixteen-nation invading army headed by U.S. imperialism back to the place where they originally launched the war—the 38th parallel, and forced them to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. After the ceasefire, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, vigilantly defended the ceasefire and peace in Korea, and waged a resolute struggle against the U.S. conspiracies and actions to undermine the armistice agreement. This righteous action and selfless fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in safeguarding peace have been unanimously praised and admired by peace-loving people all over the world. This is a great honor for the Chinese People's Volunteers and a great honor for all the Chinese people!

    During the seven years that the Chinese People's Volunteers have been in Korea, they have forged a brotherly friendship with the heroic Korean people. This is a friendship forged with the blood of our two peoples. It is eternal and unbreakable. Now, as the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to leave Korea, the Korean people are holding grand rallies all over the country to bid farewell to the Chinese People's Volunteers, and both sides are showing feelings of reluctance to part, which is quite natural. However, although the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to leave Korea, the hearts of the two peoples will always be linked together. The Chinese people will continue to care about the common cause of the two peoples in resisting aggression and defending peace. If the US government and its followers lose their minds and regard the peaceful action of the Chinese People's Volunteers' proactive withdrawal from Korea as a sign of weakness, and dare to undermine the dignity of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and once again provoke a war of aggression in Korea, then what awaits them will be a double blow and a more shameful defeat. At that time, the Chinese people, who have always been faithful to their internationalist obligations, will, as in the past, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people to fight for the common interests of the two peoples, as long as the Korean people deem it necessary.

    In two more days—March 15—the first batch of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea will begin to return to their beloved motherland. They will see that the face of today's motherland has changed greatly compared to more than seven years ago. The people of the whole country are working selflessly with vigor and revolutionary drive to build socialism. The motherland's economic and cultural construction has developed rapidly. The achievements of the motherland's construction are inseparable from the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front. It is precisely because of the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, who shed blood and sacrificed themselves, that the peace and security of the motherland have been defended, enabling the smooth progress of the motherland's economic and cultural construction. Now that the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to withdraw completely from Korea and return to the motherland, they will also devote themselves to the motherland's peaceful construction. All comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers have been tested in war and tempered in a difficult life. They are heroes in the war against aggression, and they will certainly be able to become models on the production and construction front of the motherland. They are a newly added powerful force in the motherland's production and construction, which will surely help accelerate the development of the motherland's socialist construction.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people and the most beloved people of the Chinese people. Their contribution to defending the peace and tranquility of the motherland will always be appreciated and respected by the people of the whole country. Now, along the roads through which the Chinese People's Volunteers will pass on their return to the country, people everywhere are preparing grand welcomes to celebrate their glorious return, to express the motherland's people's care and love for them. All personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers should cherish this love of the people of the motherland, guard against arrogance and complacency, humbly learn from the people, and actively devote themselves to the high tide of the motherland's production and construction, and work together with the people of the whole country to accelerate the development of the motherland's socialist production and construction.

    欢迎最可爱的人
    中国人民志愿军总部于3月12日发表公报，宣布了中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的具体步骤。按照这个计划，中国人民志愿军将在今年年底以前分三批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批六个师将于3月15日开始撤返祖国，而于4月30日以前撤完。中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，是为了谋求打开美国目前在朝鲜所造成的僵持局面，推动朝鲜问题的和平解决，并争取进一步缓和远东地区的紧张局势。这是一个光荣的和平行动。
    中国人民志愿军决定主动撤出朝鲜的消息，早已轰动全世界。一切爱好和平的国家和人民都认为，中国人民志愿军从朝鲜全部撤出的和平行动，是对和平统一朝鲜和缓和国际局势所作的重要贡献，也是对美国和在南朝鲜驻扎军队的其他国家提出了严重的考验。可是，自从朝鲜、中国和苏联三国政府先后发表关于和平解决朝鲜问题的声明以来，美国为了掩饰它目前在朝鲜问题上所处的困窘地位，一直在向世界散布漫天大谎，诬蔑朝中方面对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，力图贬低朝、中、苏三国政府分别提出的有关和平解决朝鲜问题各项建议的重大意义，并且硬说中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的和平措施只是为了“宣传”。现在，美国的这些荒谬的论调，在中国人民志愿军开始撤出朝鲜的实际行动面前，不仅已不攻自破，而且只有使美国在朝鲜问题上处于更加狼狈的地位。
    在中国人民志愿军根据中朝两国政府的建议，决定主动地全部撤出朝鲜，而且已经开始采取实际行动的时候，美国在朝鲜问题上正面临着一个越来越无法逃避的义务。这就是：美国和有军队在南朝鲜的其他国家，应同样采取措施，毫不拖延地把它们自己的军队全部撤出南朝鲜。因为，只有一切外国军队都从朝鲜撤出，朝鲜人民才有可能在不受外力干涉的情况下，根据他们自己的意志进行自由选举，实现他们长期渴望的祖国的统一。美国如果继续拒绝撤退它的侵略军，那它就会永远不能摆脱分裂朝鲜的严重责任，并且会遭到朝鲜人民越来越强烈的反对和世界公正舆论日益严厉的谴责。据西方通讯社消息，最近，美国在华盛顿纠集参加侵朝战争的十六个国家会议表明，某些有军队在南朝鲜的国家已经认识到这种对它们不利的形势，因而并不完全同意美国目前在朝鲜问题上所采取的僵硬态度。这就更加说明美国统治集团现在应该是作出明智抉择的时候了。
    光荣的中国人民志愿军自从1950年10月25日进入朝鲜，同朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，抵抗美帝国主义的侵略以来，到现在已经有七年又四个月了。在这七年多的时间里，他们胜利地完成了抗美援朝、保家卫国的光荣的神圣使命，为中朝两国人民和世界的和平事业立下了不朽的功勋。中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一道，在极端艰难困苦的条件下迎击了历史上少有的残暴的敌人，经过三年的英勇卓绝的斗争，终于把以美帝国主义为首的十六国侵略军打退到他们原来发动战争的地方——三八线，并迫使他们不得不在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。停战以后，中国人民志愿军又同朝鲜人民军一起，警惕地捍卫着朝鲜的停战和朝鲜的和平；对美国破坏停战协定的阴谋和行动，进行了坚决的斗争。中国人民志愿军这种维护和平的正义行动和忘我的斗争精神，受到了全世界和平人类的同声赞扬和钦佩。这是中国人民志愿军的莫大光荣，也是全中国人民的莫大光荣！
    中国人民志愿军在进入朝鲜的七年多时间里，同英勇的朝鲜人民结成了亲如手足的兄弟友谊。这是我们两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊。它是永恒的和牢不可破的。现在，当中国人民志愿军就要开始离开朝鲜的时候，朝鲜人民正在全国各地举行盛大集会向中国人民志愿军送别，双方流露出依依不舍的心情，这是十分自然的。但是，中国人民志愿军虽然就要离开朝鲜了，两国人民的心却始终是会联结在一起的。中国人民将继续关怀两国人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的共同事业。如果美国政府和它的追随者丧失理智，竟然把中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的和平行动看作是软弱的表现，胆敢破坏朝鲜停战协定的尊严，在朝鲜再一次挑起侵略战争，那末，等待着它们的将会是双倍的打击和更加可耻的失败。在那个时候，始终忠实于自己的国际主义义务的中国人民，只要朝鲜人民认为有必要，就会同过去一样奋不顾身地同朝鲜人民在一起，为保卫两国人民的共同利益而战斗。
    再过两天——3月15日，第一批撤出朝鲜的中国人民志愿军部队就要开始回到自己亲爱的祖国来了。他们将会看到，今天的祖国的面貌比起七年多以前来，已经大大地改观了。全国人民正以朝气蓬勃的精神，发挥革命干劲，为建设社会主义进行着忘我的劳动。祖国的经济和文化建设事业，已经有了一日千里的发展。祖国建设事业的成就，是同中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线的英勇斗争分不开的。正是由于中国人民志愿军在朝鲜前线流血牺牲的英勇斗争，捍卫了祖国的和平和安全，使祖国的经济和文化建设事业得以顺利地进行。现在，中国人民志愿军就要全部撤出朝鲜回到祖国来了，他们也将投身到祖国的和平建设事业中来。中国人民志愿军全体同志久经战争考验和艰苦生活的锻炼，他们在反侵略战争中是英雄，在祖国的生产建设的战线上也一定能够成为模范。他们是祖国生产建设事业中新增加的一支强大力量，必将有助于加速祖国社会主义建设事业的发展。
    中国人民志愿军是中国人民最优秀的儿女，是中国人民最可爱的人。他们保卫祖国和平和安宁的功劳，会永远受到全国人民的感激和尊敬。现在，中国人民志愿军回国将要经过的道路上，各地人民正在准备盛大欢迎，庆祝他们的光荣归来，以表示祖国人民对他们的关怀和热爱。中国人民志愿军的所有人员，都应该珍视祖国人民的这种爱戴，力戒骄傲自满，虚心向人民学习，并积极地投身到祖国生产建设的高潮中来，同全国人民一道，为加速祖国的社会主义生产建设事业的发展而努力。
