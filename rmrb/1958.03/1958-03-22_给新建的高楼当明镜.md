    (I) The Artificial Lake Outside Jianguomen
    I am an old resident here, familiar with the old scenery of this area. A pond to the south, a pond to the north, with the asphalt road acting as a bridge in between. In summer, it emanated foul odors, in winter, garbage reigned supreme, a gust of wind would bring a rain of dust, dead cats and rotten dogs sprawled across it. This stinking reed pond will be transformed into a clear, rippling lake, serving as a mirror for the newly built high-rises, letting its shimmering blue light reflect off the glass windows of cars. In June, no longer will mosquito control teams be seen carrying bamboo poles approaching its side, instead, you will see girls holding small stools, going to the trees by the lake to enjoy the cool of the evening.

    (II) Busily Digging the Lake with Warm Affection
    Red flags flutter here and there, songs resonate on this side and that, hoes are raised and fall again, the people digging the lake are busier than bees. Double shoulder carries, single shoulder carries, the east wind blows, sweat flows, paths are trod out on the muddy ground, you come, I go on the road. You don't recognize me, I don't recognize you, yet we seem like old acquaintances, working together shoulder to shoulder, busily digging the lake with warm affection.

    (III) Look at You, This Little Girl
    Look at you, this little girl, with your aggrieved little appearance, pigtails like a peddler's rattle drum, bouncing and skipping, wanting to leave the village, eyes filled with tears, a small lamb tethered to the corner of her mouth, aggrieved little appearance, look at you, this little girl.
    Is it because you didn't get the candy you wanted? Did you take a fancy to some fancy clothes? Did you fall out with a close classmate? Please tell me, this little girl.
    It's not for this, and it's not for that, the urgency is only for one thing: she wants to go to the artificial lake to dig soil, but her mother says "the handle of the hoe is longer than you are!"

    给新建的高楼当明镜
    臧克家
    （一）建国门外人工湖我是这里的老住户，清楚这一带的旧风光。南边一个塘，北边一个塘，柏油路夹在当中当桥梁。夏天，这里蒸发臭气，冬天，垃圾在这里为王，一阵风吹过，尘雨纷纷，死猫烂狗在上面纵卧横躺。就是这个臭苇塘，要它变成清水汪汪，让它给新建的高楼当明镜，让它给汽车的玻璃窗闪耀青光。六月天，不再看见捕蚊队手持竹竿走向它身旁，看见的是姑娘们拿着小板凳，走到湖边树下去乘晚凉。
    （二）亲亲热热为挖湖忙红旗这儿那儿飘，歌声这边那边响，镢头举起又落下，挖湖的人们比蜜蜂忙。双人担，单人挑，东风吹，汗水淌，烂泥巴上踏出路，路上你来我又往。你不认得我来，我不认得你，你我却好似老相识，一道儿工作擦着肩膀，亲亲热热为挖湖忙。
    （三）你看你这个小姑娘你看你这个小姑娘，委委屈屈小模样，小辫像摇货郎鼓，蹦着跳着要出庄，眼皮包着两汪泪，嘴角拴住个小绵羊，委委屈屈小模样，你看你这个小姑娘。是要买糖果没随心愿？是看中了什么花衣裳？是和要好的同学闹翻了脸？请问你这个小姑娘。不是为了这，也不是为了那，发急只为了事儿一椿：她要到人工湖上去挖土，妈妈说“镢头的杆儿比你长”
