    Smash the Manila Conference's Provocation of Peace
    Just as the people of Asian countries are actively striving to ease international tensions, and just as the peace initiatives and peace actions of the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Vietnam are having a widespread impact in Asia, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, manipulated by the United States, has decided to hold a council meeting in Manila starting on March 11. This meeting is a continuation of the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Organization. The imperialist bloc is attempting to use this meeting to create tension in Asia, resist the trend of peace, and intensify the implementation of its arms expansion and war preparations and colonial aggression plans. Therefore, the convening of the Manila Conference is a serious threat to peace in Asia and a provocation by the imperialist bloc against the peace-loving people of Asia.
    Judging from the information revealed recently, the imperialist bloc, headed by the United States, will instigate a series of anti-peace conspiracies at the Manila Conference.
    First, the United States wants to expand its network of military strategic bases, drag the three Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan) into its nuclear arms race plan, and try to establish rocket bases within these countries. Philippine President Garcia recently revealed in his remarks that the Philippines will take the lead in supporting the United States in realizing this plan. The United States is also putting pressure on the governments of these countries.
    At the same time, the United States will repeat at the Manila Conference a "suggestion" that was raised at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Ankara meeting of the Baghdad Pact Organization: to link its three military treaty groups in Europe and Asia. The United States intends to use this method to make the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization an appendage of its main aggressive group—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, thereby attempting to make the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization also bear the military obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The purpose of the United States in doing this is to turn the entire Eastern Hemisphere into a battlefield for atomic war.
    Another conspiracy of the Manila Conference is to attempt to rudely interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. Since its establishment, countless facts have proven that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool for the United States to promote its colonial expansion plan in Southeast Asia. It has never let go of any opportunity that can be used to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries under the guise of so-called "anti-subversion" and to obstruct their struggles for national liberation. For several years, Indonesia's separatist activities have been supported by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Manila and Singapore have become two strongholds for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and Indonesian rebels to engage in "political smuggling." The main activity of the Anglo-American Joint Committee of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, located in Singapore, is to subvert Indonesia. Since February 1957, the institutions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have continuously dispatched "commanders" to help Hussein train rebels; in recent months, a large number of arms have been supplied to the rebel areas. On the eve of this Manila Conference, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conducted a large-scale exercise on the sea very close to Indonesia, attempting to intimidate the Indonesian government and people, thereby supporting the rebels. There are reports that the conference will discuss the situation in Indonesia, and some have even clamored to "invite" the rebels to attend the conference as "observers." This shows how intolerably the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's interference in Indonesia has become.
    It is not difficult for anyone to see that if the conspiracies planned by the United States at the Manila Conference are allowed to succeed, the entire Asian situation will become more tense, the danger of atomic war in Asia will greatly increase, and the people of Asia will not but worry about the fate of peace.
    The conspiracies planned by the Manila Conference are especially dangerous for the Asian member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The reason why the United States wants to establish rocket bases in these countries is nothing more than to use dollars and military technology as a means to exchange for the territory and cannon fodder of these countries, and to move the atomic war to places far away from the United States, so that other countries become the targets of nuclear retaliation from the anti-aggression side. Thailand's "Daily Mail" is right: accepting American rocket weapons in Thailand is tantamount to "inviting a wolf into the house," creating tension with foreign countries, abandoning one's neighbors, and "harming others without benefiting oneself."
    Now the facts are even clearer that it is all harm and no benefit for the three Asian countries to participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. When they joined this aggressive organization, they had imagined that they could use "U.S. aid" to develop their economies and solve some economic difficulties. But now, even this idea cannot but be shattered. Facts have proved that the result of accepting "U.S. aid" is only being dragged onto the path of arms expansion and war preparations planned by the United States.
    The anti-peace activities carried out by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States in the Southeast Asian region cannot but arouse serious attention and strong condemnation from all peace-loving countries and people. The Soviet TASS issued a statement on March 8, powerfully exposing the conspiracies of the Manila Conference and making a solemn warning to the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Group that are following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war. The TASS statement also pointed out: "To make a major improvement in the international situation and establish the necessary trust between countries, it is necessary to establish a European and Asian collective security system to replace the existing military blocs, and it is necessary to consolidate and expand the Asian peace zone. The conclusion of an Asian collective peace treaty will be an important step in this regard." These suggestions of the Soviet Union are completely in line with the common aspirations of the people of Asian countries, and this is also the consistent proposition of many peace-loving countries in Asia. Therefore, it will undoubtedly receive great attention and support from the people of Asian countries.
    From the day the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was established, the Chinese government and people have resolutely opposed this military alliance of colonial countries, because this military alliance is bound to bring serious threats to the independence and peace of Asian countries. The Chinese Premier and the Prime Ministers of India and Burma jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and advocated applying these principles to general international relations. The Chinese government has also always supported Prime Minister Nehru's proposition on expanding the peace zone, and has consistently advocated replacing military blocs with collective peace. As early as September 1954, when the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had just been established, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out: "What Asian countries need is peace and cooperation, not war and hostility. Asian countries should conduct consultations and take various effective measures to promote collective cooperation and jointly safeguard the collective peace and security of Asia." On July 30, 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress: "The Chinese people hope that the countries in Asia and the Pacific region, including the United States, will sign a collective peace treaty to replace the antagonistic military blocs currently existing in this region." Obviously, if these propositions can be realized, they will be of great significance for consolidating peace in Asia and the world and for easing international tensions.
    Today, in Asia, as in other parts of the world, the tide of peace is unstoppable. The people of Asia demand peaceful coexistence, oppose the arms race; demand respect for national independence and sovereignty, oppose interference in internal affairs; demand that Asia be transformed into a nuclear-weapon-free zone, oppose the United States establishing rocket bases in Asia; demand the promotion of international cooperation between countries, oppose imperialism creating antagonism in Asia. The imperialist bloc headed by the United States is attempting to use the Manila Conference to create a counter-current of anti-peace in Asia, which will only arouse more resolute resistance from the people of Asian countries. The people of Asian countries will unite to smash the Manila Conference's provocation of peace and raise the banner of peace even higher and advance victoriously!

### 粉碎马尼拉会议对和平的挑衅

    粉碎马尼拉会议对和平的挑衅
    正当亚洲各国人民为缓和国际紧张局势而积极努力的时候，正当苏联、中国、朝鲜和越南的和平倡议与和平行动在亚洲发生广泛影响的时候，由美国所操纵的东南亚条约组织决定于3月11日起在马尼拉举行理事会会议。这次会议是北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议和巴格达条约组织安卡拉会议的继续。帝国主义集团企图利用这次会议在亚洲制造紧张局势，抵挡和平趋势，以便加紧推行扩军备战和殖民侵略计划。因此，马尼拉会议的召开，是对亚洲和平的严重威胁，是帝国主义集团对亚洲爱好和平人民的挑衅。
    从最近各方面所透露的消息来看，以美国为首的帝国主义集团将在马尼拉会议上策动一系列的反和平阴谋。
    首先，美国想扩大它的军事战略基地网，把东南亚条约组织的三个亚洲成员国（菲律宾、泰国、巴基斯坦）拖进它的核备战计划中，设法在这些国家境内建立火箭基地。菲律宾总统加西亚在最近的言论中就曾透露，菲律宾将要带头支持美国实现这个计划。美国也正对这些国家的政府施加压力。
    同时，美国在马尼拉会议上还将重复在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议和巴格达条约组织安卡拉会议上提出过的一项“建议”：把它在欧亚两洲的三个军事条约集团联结起来。美国打算用这种手段使东南亚条约组织成为它的主要侵略集团——北大西洋公约集团的附属物，从而企图使东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员国也要承担北大西洋公约组织的军事义务。美国这样做的目的是想要把整个东半球变为原子战争的战场。
    马尼拉会议的另一个阴谋，就是企图粗暴地干涉印度尼西亚的内政。东南亚条约组织自从成立以来，无数事实证明，它是美国在东南亚推行殖民扩张计划的工具。它一直不放松任何可以利用的机会，在所谓“反颠覆”的幌子下，干涉东南亚国家的内政，阻挡它们争取民族解放的斗争。几年以来，印度尼西亚的分裂活动就一直得到东南亚条约组织的支持。马尼拉和新加坡已经成为东南亚条约组织和印度尼西亚叛乱分子从事“政治走私”的两个据点。设在新加坡的东南亚条约组织英美联合委员会的主要活动就是要颠覆印度尼西亚。从1957年2月以来，东南亚条约组织的机构就不断地派遣“指挥员”帮助侯赛尼训练叛军；最近几个月来，又以大批军火接济叛乱地区。在这次马尼拉会议前夕，东南亚条约组织更在离印度尼西亚很近的海面上举行大规模的演习，企图恫吓印度尼西亚政府和人民，从而给叛乱分子撑腰。有消息说，这次会议将讨论印度尼西亚的局势问题，甚至有人扬言要“邀请”叛乱分子作为“观察员”列席会议。这说明东南亚条约组织对印度尼西亚的干涉已经到了多么不能令人容忍的地步。
    任何人都不难看到，如果让美国在马尼拉会议上所策划的这些阴谋得逞，那末整个亚洲局势就会更加紧张，亚洲的原子战争危险就会大大增加，亚洲人民将不能不对和平的命运担忧。
    马尼拉会议所策划的阴谋，对于东南亚条约组织的亚洲成员国说来，尤其是危险的。美国所以想在这些国家的领土上建立火箭基地，无非是想以美元和军事技术为手段换取这些国家的领土和炮灰，把原子战争移到远离美国本土的地方去进行，从而使别的国家成为来自反侵略方面的核武器报复打击的目标。泰国的“每日邮报”说得对：泰国如接受美国火箭武器无异是“引狼入室”，同外国一起制造紧张局势，而背弃自己的邻国，“既损人又不利己”。
    现在的事实更加清楚了，亚洲三个国家参加东南亚条约组织，是有百害而无一利的。它们在参加这个侵略组织的时候，曾经幻想借助于“美援”来发展自己的经济，解决一些经济困难。但如今，就连这种想法也不能不破灭了。事实证明，接受“美援”的结果，只是被拖上了美国所策划的扩军备战的道路。　
    以美国为首的帝国主义集团在东南亚地区所进行的反和平的活动，不能不引起一切爱好和平国家和人民的严重注意和强烈的谴责。苏联塔斯社已于3月8日受权发表声明，有力地揭露了马尼拉会议的阴谋，并对追随美国扩军备战的东南亚条约集团的成员国提出了严正的警告。塔斯社的声明还指出：“要使国际局势有重大的好转和建立国与国之间必要的信任，就必须建立欧洲和亚洲集体安全体系来代替现有的军事集团，就必须巩固和扩大亚洲和平地区。缔结亚洲集体和平公约将是这方面的重要步骤。”苏联的这些建议完全符合亚洲各国人民的共同愿望，同时这也是亚洲许多爱好和平国家的一贯主张。因此，它无疑地会受到亚洲各国人民的极大重视和支持。
    从东南亚条约组织成立的一天起，我国政府和人民就坚决反对这个殖民国家的军事同盟，因为这种军事同盟必然要给亚洲国家的独立和和平带来严重的威胁。我国总理同印度、缅甸总理共同倡议了和平共处五项原则，而且主张把这些原则应用到一般的国际关系中。我国政府也始终支持尼赫鲁总理关于扩大和平地区的主张，并一贯主张用集体和平代替军事集团。早在1954年9月，在东南亚条约组织刚刚成立的时候，周恩来总理就曾指出：“亚洲国家需要的是和平和合作，而不是战争和敌视。亚洲各国应该进行协商，采取各种有效措施，促进集体合作，共同努力维护亚洲的集体和平和安全。”1955年7月30日，周恩来总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上又指出：“中国人民希望亚洲和太平洋地区的国家，包括美国在内，签订一个集体和平公约，以代替目前存在于这个地区的对立性的军事集团。”很明显，这些主张如果能够实现，对于巩固亚洲及世界和平，对于缓和国际紧张局势，将有极大的意义。
    今天，在亚洲，同在世界其他地方一样，和平的潮流已经势不可挡。亚洲人民要求和平共处，反对军备竞赛；要求尊重民族独立和主权，反对干涉内政；要求把亚洲变为无原子武器区，反对美国在亚洲建立火箭基地；要求促进各国之间的国际合作，反对帝国主义在亚洲制造对立。以美国为首的帝国主义集团企图利用马尼拉会议在亚洲制造一股反和平的逆流，这只会激起亚洲各国人民的更坚决的反抗。亚洲各国人民将会团结起来粉碎马尼拉会议对和平的挑衅，并且更高地举起和平的旗帜胜利前进！
