    Utilizing Hydropower and Biogas Generation
    Anhui Plans to Achieve Electrification in Five Years
    Fuyang, March 14th (From Our Newspaper) — Anhui Province has planned to achieve electrification throughout the province within five years.
    The requirements for electrification throughout the province are to utilize large hydropower and thermal power plants for electricity transmission, and to establish small power plants, so that each county town can have an average of 6,000 kilowatts of electricity for lighting, and for factories producing 10,000 tons of fertilizer per year, as well as other industrial uses. In rural areas, this will be achieved in three steps. The first step is to achieve electricity for lighting, processing, and partial water pumping. The second step is to achieve electricity for all irrigation water pumping. The third step is to achieve electricity for cultivation and other uses.
    Anhui Province's power construction will mainly rely on hydropower and biogas generation. There are already dozens of large and medium-sized hydropower stations under construction or planned, including Meishan, Foziling, Xianghongdian, Mozitan, and Maojianshan. These hydropower stations will generate 300,000 kilowatts within five years. In rural areas, a large number of small hydropower stations and biogas power stations will be built. Small hydropower stations will mainly be built in the hilly areas of northern and southern Anhui (rural small hydropower stations under construction this year will reach 10,000 kilowatts). Biogas power stations will mainly be built in northern Anhui. According to calculations, the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County, with more than 800 households, only needs 32 kilowatts of electricity to reach the first step requirement, 45 kilowatts to reach the second step requirement, and 90 kilowatts to reach the third step requirement. This cooperative only needs each household to raise an average of five pigs, three sheep, one head of cattle or horse, plus some garbage and weeds, etc., to basically meet the manure needed for 45 kilowatts of power generation. The investment required for construction is only 108 yuan per household. (Yu Ming)

    利用水力及沼气发电
    安徽计划五年实现电气化
    本报阜阳14日电　安徽省又计划五年内实现全省电气化。
    全省电气化的要求是，利用水力、火力大发电站输电和建立小型电厂，使全省每个县城平均能有六千瓩的电供应照明，供应年产一万吨化肥的工厂及其他工业用电。在农村则分三步走，第一步达到照明、加工、部分抽水用电；第二步达到抽水灌溉全部用电；第三步达到耕地及其他用电。
    安徽省的电力建设将主要依靠水力及沼气发电。现在已在建设和规划中要建设的大中型水电站，有梅山、佛子岭、响洪甸、磨子潭和毛尖山等数十个。这些水电站五年内将发电三十万瓩。在农村将大量兴建小型水电站和沼气发电站。小型水电站主要在淮南、皖南的丘陵山区建设（今年建设的农村小型水电站即达一万瓩）。淮北主要建设沼气发电站。根据计算，阜阳县新华农业社八百多户，只要发电三十二瓩便可达到第一步要求，四十五瓩就可达到第二步要求，九十瓩就可达到第三步要求。这个社只需每户平均养猪五头，羊三头，牛马等大牲畜一头，加上部分垃圾、杂草等，基本上可满足四十五瓩发电用的粪便。建设所需投资每户只需一百零八元。（于明）
