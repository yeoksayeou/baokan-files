Editor's Note:

    A stagnant "old man's attitude" exists on the propaganda front, and it should be swept away immediately!

    Those who promote others should also promote themselves. If you are propagandizing and encouraging others to leap forward, how can you not leap forward yourself?

    The propaganda workers of Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory and four other factories took the lead in breaking through the stagnation and raising the banner for a great leap forward in propaganda work. This great leap forward in propaganda work has already played a role in fueling the great leap forward in production.

    Many propaganda workers believe that ideological and political work is different from production work and cannot be used in competitions. The Tianjin experience has also broken this convention. Now, these five factories have issued a challenge, declaring to "make propaganda work always walk in the forefront of the movement, serving as the vanguard of the movement." This fighting initiative has already received strong support from the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee. Propaganda workers across the country should also rise up to answer the challenge!

    A prominent symptom of the bourgeois ideological illness contracted by intellectuals is inconsistency between words and deeds. For propaganda workers to immediately embrace this era of great leaps forward and also have a great leap forward in propaganda work is precisely an effective remedy for this old problem.

### 促进别人也要促进自己

    促进别人也要促进自己
    宣传工作战线上有一股暮气沉沉的“老头子气”，应该立即把它一扫而光！
    促进别人的人也要促进自己。宣传鼓动人家跃进，自己怎能不跃进呢？
    天津纺织机械厂等五个工厂的宣传工作人员一马当先，冲破了暮气，为宣传工作的大跃进打起了大旗。这种宣传工作的大跃进已经为生产大跃进起了加油送炭的作用。
    有不少宣传工作者认为，思想政治工作和生产工作不同，不能开展竞赛。天津的经验也打破了这个陈规。现在，这五个厂又发出了挑战书，要“使宣传工作永远走在运动的前面，作运动的开路先锋。”这个战斗的倡议，已经得到天津市委的大力支持。全国的宣传工作人员也应当起来应战！
    知识分子染下的资产阶级思想病，一个突出的病征就是言行不一致。宣传工作人员立即迎上这个跃进的时代，在宣传工作上也来一个大跃进，也正是医治这个老毛病的特效药。
