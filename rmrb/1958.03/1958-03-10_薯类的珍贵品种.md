    Precious Varieties of Root Crops

    "51-93" sweet potato is a new and excellent variety of sweet potato. The yield of this variety is higher than that of "Victory No. 100," the nutrients are richer than "Victory No. 100," and the taste is sweeter than "Victory No. 100." It also has other advantages such as "strong adaptability, stable yield, and early maturity."
      The "51-93" sweet potato was bred by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute using sexual hybridization methods. The female parent of the hybrid is "Victory No. 100" and the male parent is "Nanrui Sweet Potato".※
    Zhashui County in Shaanxi Province has a "winter-over potato" (potato) that is sown in October of the previous year and harvested in April of the following year. The "winter-over potato" yields more than 1,000 jin per mu in some agricultural cooperatives, which is equivalent to planting three mu of other miscellaneous grains. An even greater advantage of planting "winter-over potatoes" is that early corn, beans, etc. can be intercropped in the potato fields, increasing the harvest per unit area. The Yingfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yaowang Township of this county planted 35 mu of "winter-over potatoes" last winter, and harvested 892 jin of potatoes and more than 100 jin of corn and beans per mu. ※
    Late blight is a serious disease of potatoes. The "Wuxia potato" in Wushan County, Sichuan Province, is a good variety with the ability to resist late blight. The "Wuxia potato" planted in Yangliu Township, Wushan County, has been harvested every year due to its disease resistance, with an average yield of more than 3,000 jin per mu, which is twice as high as local varieties.

    薯类的珍贵品种
    “51—93”甘薯，是一个新的甘薯优良品种。这个品种的产量比“胜利百号”高，养分比“胜利百号”丰富，味道也比“胜利百号”甘美。它还有别的优点像“适应性强，产量稳定和早熟”等。
      “51—93”甘薯是华东农业科学研究所用有性杂交的方法选育的。杂交的母本是“胜利百号”，父本是“南瑞苕”。※
    陕西柞水县有一种前一年十月播种，第二年四月收获的“隔冬洋芋”（马铃薯）。“隔冬洋芋”在一些农业社亩产一千多斤，比种别的杂粮一亩顶三亩。种“隔冬洋芋”更大的好处是可以在洋芋田里套种早玉米、豆子等，增加单位面积的收获量。这个县药王乡营丰农业社去年冬种的三十五亩“隔冬洋芋”，每亩就收了八百九十二斤洋芋和一百多斤玉米、豆子。※
    晚疫病是马铃薯的一种严重病害。四川巫山县的“巫峡马铃薯”是具有抵抗晚疫病能力的良种。在巫山县杨柳乡种植的“巫峡马铃薯”，由于它抗病而年年丰收，平均亩产三千斤以上，高出当地品种一倍。
