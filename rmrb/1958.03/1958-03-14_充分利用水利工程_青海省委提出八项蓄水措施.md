Fully Utilize Water Conservancy Projects
Qinghai Provincial Party Committee Proposes Eight Water Storage Measures

(This dispatch from our newspaper, Xining, March 13th) The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has proposed eight measures to fully utilize existing water conservancy projects to overcome drought and strive for a bumper harvest. These eight measures are: 1. Strengthen water storage projects; 2. Dredge springs and divert water, prevent seepage and increase water volume; 3. Maintain canals well, eliminate water leakage; 4. Widely and rapidly carry out a simple land leveling movement, change the wasteful phenomenon of large-scale flooding irrigation, implement small-plot irrigation methods, save water, and advocate using one point of water as two points; 5. Irrigate day and night, and eliminate empty flow; 6. Strengthen canal management, with close cooperation between upstream and downstream, and between neighbors; 7. Drought-stricken areas should carry out urgently needed water and soil conservation projects, prepare to intercept and divert mountain water in a timely manner, and fully utilize rainwater in the fields; 8. Strengthen leadership and comprehensive planning.

In order to implement these measures, the Provincial Party Committee decided that two-thirds of the personnel from provincial-level units should go to the countryside and mountains before March 15th, with one unit responsible for one county, or small units combining to be responsible for one county. A group of cadres will also be transferred to lead the construction projects of five large canals: the Huangbei Main Canal, the Datong River Main Canal, the Datong River East Canal, the Huangnan First Canal, and the Huangnan Second Canal.

The annual rainfall in the agricultural area of Qinghai Province is about 400 mm, mostly concentrated in August and September; in addition, there has been very little snowfall this winter and spring. Therefore, fully utilizing existing water conservancy projects is of decisive significance for ensuring a bumper grain harvest this year.

    充分利用水利工程
    青海省委提出八项蓄水措施
    本报西宁13日电  中共青海省委提出八个充分发挥现有水利工程作用的措施，以战胜干旱，争取丰收。这八个措施是：一、加强蓄水工程；二、掏泉引水，防治渗漏，加大水量；三、做好渠道养护，杜绝跑水现象；四、广泛迅速地开展简易平整土地运动，改变大片漫灌的浪费现象，实行小畦灌溉的方法，节约用水，提倡一点水当二点水用；五、日夜灌溉，禁绝空流；六、加强水渠管理，上下游、左邻右舍亲密协作，互相照顾；七、受旱地区进行急需的水土保持工程，准备及时截引山水，把雨水全部利用到田里去；八、加强领导，全面规划。
    为了实现这些措施，省委决定由省级各单位抽调三分之二的人员在3月15日前下乡上山，一个单位包一个县，单位小的联合起来包一个县。还要抽调一批干部去领导湟北干渠、大通河总干渠、大通河东干渠、湟南第一干渠、湟南第二干渠等五个大型渠道的修建工程。
    青海省农业区年降雨量四百公厘左右，多集中在8、9月间；加之，去冬今春降雪量很少，因此，充分利用现有水利工程，对于保证今年的粮食大丰收有着决定性的意义。
