    "Song of Youth"
    "Song of Youth" (published by Writers Publishing House) is set against the historical backdrop of the period from the "September 18th Incident" to the "December 9th Movement," reflecting many aspects of the student movement in Beiping under the leadership of the Party at that time.
    The novel unfolds along the life path of the protagonist, Lin Daojing. Lin Daojing is a young, enthusiastic, and troubled girl. She gets to know the underground Party member Lu Jiachuan and other patriotic youths. The radiance emanating from these characters opens the windows of her heart, leading her to join the revolutionary collective, accept various severe tests, and ultimately become an excellent revolutionary fighter.
    In addition to Lin Daojing, the novel also features many other vivid and moving characters: Lu Jiachuan, who perseveres in struggle even after being subjected to severe torture in prison; Jiang Hua, Zheng Jin, and Lin Hong, who repeatedly escape death; Wang Xiaoyan, who nearly goes astray; and the traitor Dai Yu, who betrays the revolution and his comrades, ultimately being sentenced to death by the revolution.
    Despite some roughness in its artistic structure, it clearly conveys the pulse of the era and shows the path taken by Chinese revolutionary intellectuals in the 1940s. (Mei)
    Mi Gu's Cartoon Collection
    "In an Era of Earth-Shaking Changes" is a collection of cartoons by the cartoonist Mi Gu, including eighty-four political satire cartoons created by the author between 1946 and 1956. These works were mostly published in Hong Kong and domestic newspapers and periodicals in a timely manner, in coordination with the development of the current situation. With his sharp pen, the author powerfully exposed and attacked enemies at home and abroad, giving full play to the fighting role of cartoons.
    Cartoons are a popular form of art that should reach the broad masses. However, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House's publication of this cartoon collection, due to its one-sided pursuit of beautiful forms, has resulted in a high price of four yuan and ten cents per copy. With such a high price, the print run will naturally be reduced, with only seven hundred and fifty copies printed in the first edition. How can this be popularized? (Ji)
    "History of Film Art"
    This is a systematic account of the evolution of world film art. The author, Georges Sadoul, is a famous French progressive film historian. In this book, he provides a comprehensive overview and introduction to the birth of film, the development of film art, the rise of national film schools in various countries, and the major works of world cinema over the past sixty years.
    The main feature of this book is that it narrates the evolution of film art in conjunction with the political and economic background of various countries, technological inventions, the development of the film industry, and the relationship between film and literature and other arts. The author provides a detailed account of the rise, artistic achievements, and influence of Soviet cinema, as well as a brilliant introduction and analysis of the formation of Italian Neo-Realism and the rise of national cinemas in South America, Asia, and Africa after World War II.

    “青春之歌”
    “青春之歌”（作家出版社出版）以“九一八”迄“一二九”那个历史时代为背景，反映了当时在党领导下的北平学生运动的许多侧面。
    小说沿着主人公林道静的生活道路展开。林道静是个年轻、热情的、饱经忧患的姑娘。她结识了地下党员卢嘉川和其他的一些爱国青年。从这些人物身上散射出来的光辉打开了她心灵的窗子，使她投向了革命集体，接受了各种各样的严峻的考验，终至使自己成为一个优秀的革命战士。
    除了林道静以外，小说里还出现了许多性格鲜明的动人的形象：经过严刑拷打，但还在狱中坚持斗争的卢嘉川，不止一次地出死入生的江华、郑瑾和林红，险入歧途的王晓燕以及出卖革命、出卖同志终至被革命宣判死刑的叛徒戴愉等等。
    尽管它的艺术结构还有些粗糙，但令人分明地感到了时代脉搏的跃动，看到四十年代中国革命知识分子所经历的道路。　（楳）
    米谷的漫画集
    “在天翻地复的时代里”是漫画家米谷的漫画选集，内容包括作者从1946到1956十年间，所创作的八十四幅政治讽刺画。这些作品大都是配合着当时的形势发展，及时地发表在香港和国内各报纸和周刊上的。作者以锐利的笔锋，有力地揭露和打击了国内外的敌人，发挥了漫画的战斗作用。
    漫画是一种普及的美术作品，应该深入到广大的群众中去，可是人民美术出版社出版这本漫画，由于片面地追求漂亮的形式，结果使书价高达四元一角之多。订价高了印数自然就要减少，第一次只印了七百五十本。试问这样如何能够普及呢？　（纪）
    “电影艺术史”
    这是一本系统地叙述世界电影艺术演进的著作。作者乔治·萨杜尔是法国著名的进步电影史家。在本书中，他对电影的诞生、电影艺术的发展，各国民族电影学派的兴起及六十年来世界电影的主要作品，作了一个全面的概述与介绍。
    本书的主要特点是结合各国的政治经济背景、技术的发明、电影企业的发展及电影与文学和别的艺术的关系来叙述电影艺术的演变。作者对苏联电影的兴起、艺术上的成就与影响有详细的叙述，对意大利新现实主义的形成及第二次世界大战后南美洲、亚洲、非洲各国民族电影的崛兴，也作了精辟的介绍与分析。　（昭）
