Question from Readers

    Can We Go to the Border Areas to Reclaim Wasteland?
    To the Editors:
    We are a group of young workers and demobilized soldiers. We want to settle in Xinjiang, engage in agricultural production, and dedicate our youth to the construction of the motherland's border areas. We believe that mobilizing some people from cities and densely populated areas to sparsely populated areas for production and work would also benefit the country. But we don't know if our request can be met. If we can go, what procedures should we go through?
          Sun Jiaqi, Commercial Bureau of Ying Shan County
      Yin Qihui, Zhang Minghua, Haikang, Guangdong
Sun Jiaqi, Yin Qihui, Zhang Minghua and other comrades:
    Recently, we have received letters from some readers with similar requests to yours. Some want to go to the Great Northern Wilderness, some want to go to Hainan Island, and some propose to move their entire families to reclaim wasteland. This kind of enthusiasm to support socialist construction is very good. We are now telling you the results of our research with the relevant departments.
    In the past few years, the competent departments have already carried out immigration and organized a group of young people to go to remote areas for reclamation in some regions. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of immigrants to reclaim wasteland and help them build homes and businesses, the government has provided some assistance in terms of financial and material resources, which has played a certain role in supporting socialist construction. However, since most of the wasteland is distributed in border areas, and problems such as water conservancy and transportation cannot be completely solved for the time being, it is difficult to carry out large-scale immigration and reclamation. Therefore, when the government arranges the current immigration and reclamation plan, it must not only consider the needs, but also whether the objective conditions are possible. For the time being, it can only be carried out in a planned and focused manner. It is not necessary to universally organize young people to go to the border areas for reclamation in various places. Immigration for the purpose of adjusting population density is not an urgent task. The issue of urban population immigration and reclamation, because most of the urban population does not have the habit and skills of participating in agricultural labor, according to the experience of the past few years, it is not suitable for participating in long-distance immigration and reclamation, but should be gradually transferred to the countryside nearby, depending on the individual, to engage in labor production.
    Therefore, we hope that you will use your enthusiasm for immigration and reclamation in your current work or production posts and strive for the great leap forward in socialist construction.

### 可否到边疆去开荒？

    可否到边疆去开荒？
    编辑同志：
    我们是一群青年职工和复员军人。我们想到新疆去安家落户，参加农业生产，把自己的青春献给祖国边疆的建设事业。我们认为在城市和人口稠密地区动员一些人到人口稀少地区去生产和工作，这样对国家也有好处。但不知可以满足我们的要求否？如果可以前去，应该办那些手续？
          应山县商业局　孙家琪
      广东海康　尹启辉　张明华孙家琪、尹启辉、张明华等同志：
    近来我们陆续接到一些读者来信，提出和你们相同的要求。只是有的想去北大荒，有的想去海南岛，有的提出要全家移民垦荒。这种积极要求支援社会主义建设的精神，是很好的。现在把我们和有关部门研究的结果告诉你们。
    过去几年里，主管部门已经在部分地区进行了移民和组织一批青年到边远地区去开垦的工作。为鼓励移民垦荒的积极性，帮助移民建家立业，政府在财力物力上给了一些帮助，对支援社会主义建设起了一定的作用。但是，由于荒地多数分布在边疆地区，水利、交通等问题暂时还不能全部解决，要进行大规模的移民垦荒是有困难的。因此，政府在安排当前移民垦荒计划时，不仅要看需要，而且还要看客观条件是否可能。暂时只能是有计划、有重点地进行。还不需要在各地普遍组织青年到边疆去垦荒。为调整人口密度而移民不是当务之急。城市人口移民垦荒问题，因为城市人口多数没有参加农业劳动的习惯和技术，根据几年来的经验，不宜参加远距离的移民垦荒，只能分别对象，逐步的就近转入农村，从事劳动生产。
    因此，希望你们把要求移民垦荒的热情，用在正在从事的工作或生产岗位上，为社会主义建设大跃进而努力。
