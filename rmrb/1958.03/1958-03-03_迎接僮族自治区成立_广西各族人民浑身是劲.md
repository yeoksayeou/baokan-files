Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 1st: After the joyous news of the formal establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on March 5th spread, people of all nationalities in Guangxi, including Zhuang, Han, and others, were overjoyed and even more motivated in their revolutionary work.

The recent session of the People's Congress of Baise County has passed a resolution to boost revolutionary vigor, improve water conservancy, accumulate fertilizer, plant trees, and prepare for plowing to welcome the establishment of the autonomous region. Since the meeting, all work in the county has been developing rapidly. The workers of all nationalities at the Baiguang and other eleven medium-sized reservoirs continue to work actively on water conservancy projects during the Spring Festival. Their slogan is: "Build reservoirs well to welcome the birth of the autonomous region."

The workers of all nationalities in the 601 construction area of the Tianyang Sugar Factory under construction said that they were full of energy after hearing about the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Workers in the boiler room of this construction area successfully used a planer to shave unqualified refractory bricks, increasing work efficiency tenfold and changing the situation of insufficient supply of refractory bricks, which accelerated the construction progress.

After the good news of the establishment of the autonomous region spread, people of all nationalities became more united and helped each other, working together to develop production. More than 75,000 farmers of all nationalities from seven counties, including Tianyang, Tiandong, and Debao, enthusiastically went to support the Baidong River Reservoir project, the largest in the Baise area. They plan to complete the task of irrigating 115,000 mu of cultivated land by the time the autonomous region is established. (Attached picture)

    迎接僮族自治区成立
    广西各族人民浑身是劲
    据新华社南宁1日电　3月5日正式成立广西僮族自治区的喜讯传开后，广西僮族、汉族及其他各族人民欢欣鼓舞，更提高了革命干劲。
    最近召开的百色县人民代表大会会议，已作出决议，要鼓足革命干劲，搞好水利、积肥、造林和备耕工作，迎接自治区的成立。会后全县的各项工作都在迅速发展。百光等十一个中型水库的各族民工，春节照常出工积极修水利，他们的口号是：“修好水库，迎接自治区的诞生”。
    正在兴建的田阳糖厂六零一工区的各族工人说，听到要成立广西僮族自治区，浑身是劲。这个工区锅炉间的工人试用刨床刨制不合规格的耐火砖成功，工作效率较前提高十倍，改变了耐火砖供应不上的情况，加快了施工进度。
    成立自治区的喜讯传开后，各族人民更加团结互助，共同为发展生产而努力。田阳、田东、德保等七个县的七万五千多名各族农民，踊跃地前去支援百色专区最大的百东河水库工程，他们要在自治区成立时，完成灌溉十一万五千亩耕地的计划。（附图片）
