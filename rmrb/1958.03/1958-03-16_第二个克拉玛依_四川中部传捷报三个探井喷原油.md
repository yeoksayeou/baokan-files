    Second Karamay
    Good News from Central Sichuan – Three Exploratory Wells Gush Oil

    (Our report) Following the discovery of the Karamay oil region, a new oil region has recently been discovered in central Sichuan. According to the situation in the last three days, the scale of oil production from the exploratory wells in this oil region is unprecedented in our country's history.

    A person in charge of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry said that good news has been coming from central Sichuan for the past few days. On March 12, Well No. 2 of the Longnusi structure, spanning the two counties of Wusheng and Yuechi in Sichuan Province, gushed more than 40 tons of crude oil in 40 minutes. The scope of this structure is more than 1,000 square kilometers, and more than 500 square kilometers have been measured in detail. On March 13, Well No. 3 of the Nanchong structure, not far northeast of the Longnusi structure, gushed 40 tons of crude oil in less than an hour; on the 14th, it gushed 189 tons of crude oil in two hours and eighteen minutes. The area of this structure is more than 800 square kilometers, and more than 300 square kilometers have been measured in detail. On March 13, the Penglaizhen structure, west of the Longnusi structure, gushed a large amount of natural gas and also brought out a small amount of crude oil. The scope of this structure is more than 400 square kilometers, and more than 200 square kilometers have been measured in detail.

    The person in charge of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry said that the amount of oil gushing from these three structures in central Sichuan in such a short period of time is unprecedented in the history of petroleum exploration in our country. According to geological analysis, the central Sichuan region is a new oil region in addition to the already proven Karamay oil region in our country. (Attached picture)

    第二个克拉玛依
    四川中部传捷报三个探井喷原油
    本报讯　我国继发现克拉玛依油区以后，最近在四川中部又发现了一个新油区。根据最近三天的情况，这个油区探井喷油量的规模在我国历史上是空前的。
    石油工业部负责人说，这几天来，四川中部地区接连传来捷报。3月12日，横跨四川省武胜、岳池两个县的龙女寺构造的女二井，在四十分钟里喷出四十多吨原油。这个构造的范围有一千多平方公里，已经细测了五百多平方公里。3月13日，离龙女寺构造东北不远的南充构造的充三井，不到一小时喷出了四十吨原油；14日又在两小时零十八分钟里喷出一百八十九吨原油。这个构造的面积有八百多平方公里，已经细测了三百多平方公里。3月13日，在龙女寺构造以西的蓬莱镇构造，喷出大量的天然气，还带出了少量的原油。这个构造的范围有四百多平方公里，已经细测了两百平方公里。
    石油工业部负责人说，川中地区这三个构造在这么短的时间里喷出这么多的油量，在我国石油勘探历史上是空前的。根据地质情况分析，川中地区是我国已经证实的克拉玛依油区之外的一个新油区。（附图片）
