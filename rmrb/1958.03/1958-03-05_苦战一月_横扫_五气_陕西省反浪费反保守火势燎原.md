This newspaper, Xi'an, 4th dispatch: In the Shaanxi area, all government offices, organizations, and schools have universally ignited the fire of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, deciding to fight bitterly for a month, sweep away bureaucratism, listlessness, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, and thoroughly change the face of the institutions.

Since the unfolding of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Shaanxi Province, they have fully utilized the form of big-character posters to expose wasteful phenomena, and many units have also held anti-waste exhibitions and organized movements to clear out warehouses. However, the movement has not been carried out deeply or thoroughly, and a climax has not yet been formed. In order to push this movement to a climax, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee Rectification Leadership Group held a meeting on March 1st, issuing a call to the entire province to fight bitterly for a month, eliminate waste, defeat conservatism, sweep away the "five airs," and thoroughly change the face of institutions, demanding that each unit fully value this crucial battle of anti-waste and anti-conservatism, and that the main responsible persons grasp it firmly as the guiding principle for driving all work.

On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Sixth Party Congress of Shaanxi Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs held its second emergency meeting. Li Jinglun, the Party Committee Secretary of the Health Department, presented a guarantee and a letter of proposal to the congress, stating that each Party member should produce more than ten big-character posters, and Party member section and division chiefs should produce more than fifteen big-character posters, while also guaranteeing the quality. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, individuals versus individuals, sections versus sections, and units versus units should conduct "seven comparisons," namely, comparing enthusiasm, comparing the quantity and quality of big-character posters, comparing the depth of exposure of problems, comparing the speed and quality of rectification, comparing whether the system is convenient for the masses, comparing the exploitation of potential, and comparing leadership methods. Representatives of the Service Hall Party organization proposed at the meeting to "fight at night for a week, attack for ten days," and challenged the Foreign Trade Bureau, the Finance Department, and the Provincial People's Bank General Branch of the CCP. Many government offices worked through the night, with the masses showing high morale and writing big-character posters overnight. The Provincial Health Department posted nearly three thousand big-character posters in one night. By the afternoon of the 3rd, the new big-character posters appearing in the provincial-level government offices alone had reached more than 50,000.

    苦战一月　横扫“五气”
    陕西省反浪费反保守火势燎原
    本报西安4日电　陕西地区各机关、团体、学校，普遍燃起了反浪费反保守之火，决定苦战一月，横扫官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，彻底改变机关面貌。
    陕西省各单位开展反浪费反保守运动以来，充分利用大字报的形式揭露浪费现象，并且有很多单位举办了反浪费展览会和组织了清查仓库的运动。但是，运动进行得不深不透，没有形成高潮。为了把这一运动推向高潮，中共陕西省委整风领导小组3月1日举行会议，向全省提出苦战一月，反掉浪费，打倒保守，横扫“五气”，彻底改变机关面貌的号召，要求各单位充分重视反浪费反保守这一关键性的一战，主要负责人要把它抓起来，作为带动一切工作的纲。
    2日下午，陕西省直属机关第六届党代表大会举行了第二次紧急会议。卫生厅党委会书记李经伦向大会提出保证和倡议书，每个党员要出十张以上的大字报，党员科、处长要出十五张以上大字报，并且要保证质量。在反浪费反保守运动中，个人与个人、科室与科室、单位与单位要进行“七比”，即比干劲，比大字报的数量质量，比揭发问题的深透程度，比整改的快好，比制度是否便利群众，比挖掘潜力，比领导方法。服务厅党组织的代表在会上提出要“夜战一周，突击十天”，并向中共外贸局、财政厅、省人民银行总支挑战。许多机关当夜通宵工作，群众意志昂扬，连夜赶写大字报。省卫生厅一夜就张贴了近三千张大字报。到3日下午，仅省级机关新出现的大字报已达五万多张。
