The Struggle for the Sahara by Monopoly Capital
A. Bobrovsky (Soviet Union)

    The Riches of the Sahara

    In the early 1950s, arduous geological exploration work began in the Sahara. Having been driven out of Syria, Lebanon, and Indochina by French monopoly capital, and facing competition from Americans in Morocco and Tunisia, it eagerly sought new sources of raw materials in the desert. In the past three or four years, coalfields such as Kochiksu, Sfeiya, and Maichalifu, south of Koren Pisar, natural gas fields in Jebbel Berg and Hassi R'Mel, iron ore deposits in northwestern Sahara, and copper, lead, manganese, and other mineral deposits have been discovered here. Uranium, tungsten, and tin have been found in the Hoggar Mountains.

    Finally, in 1956, large deposits of "black gold" – oil – were discovered. The two promising oilfields currently known are Hassi Messaoud in northern Sahara and near Edjeleh bordering Libya.

    Estimates of the reserves in these two oilfields vary, ranging from 300 million tons to 2 to 3 billion tons. However, even the smallest figures are very tempting for French monopoly capital, as the oil production of France and its colonies is negligible: only 1.7 million tons in 1957. In 1958, France will have to import 20 million tons of coal and 24 million tons of oil from abroad, mainly purchased with US dollars. However, the dollar deficit is stifling the vitality of French finance and economy.

    It is estimated that in two years, the Sahara will be able to produce 5 million tons of iron ore, 70,000 tons of selected copper ore, 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas, and, most importantly, approximately 10 million tons of oil. All drilling and exploration work is being accelerated. A pipeline has already been laid from Hassi Messaoud to the Mediterranean Sea.

    Not long ago, French newspapers reported new discoveries in the central Sahara. For example, rich deposits of platinum, diamonds, nickel, and other minerals were found in the Hoggar Mountains, and six geological teams are conducting prospecting.

    Dividing the Great Desert

    French Sahara (approximately 4.3 million square kilometers) lies within the French colonies of Algeria, West Africa, and Equatorial Africa. Recently, the French National Assembly passed a bill establishing the "Sahara Region Joint Organization." This organization is responsible for overseeing the development of the Sahara's resources. The newly established organization also possesses police, military, and administrative bodies.

    The French government includes all non-productive expenses for the development of the Sahara in the national budget. In 1958, the allocation for exploration and exploitation of Sahara oil is 87 billion francs, exceeding more than half of the relevant allocations in the budget.

    Approximately forty French companies are searching for oil in the Sahara. Several of France's largest banks (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, Banque de l'Indochine, Banque Rothschild, Banque Worms, and Lazard Frères) are also participating in the "development" of the Sahara.

    Not only French monopoly capital is intruding into the Sahara. The British oil giant "Royal Dutch Shell" holds 35% of the capital in "Société Pétrolière de Kleps." The same concern also holds 65% of the capital in "Société Pétrolière d'Algérie." "Société Pétrolière d'Algérie" has obtained leases for large tracts of land in the Sahara. Another British oil company, "British Petroleum," holds 65% of the capital in "Société Franco-Britannique des Pétroles."

    West German monopoly capital is also very interested in the Sahara Desert. The agreement on the "Common Market" has opened up the practical possibility for it to participate in the colonial enslavement of North Africa.

    By mid-1957, the division of the Sahara was basically completed: French and British monopoly capital had divided the resources of this desert. However, they are encountering a predatory competitor.

    The Intrusion of US Monopoly Capital

    The United States has long sought to infiltrate the Sahara. Five years ago, when French and British companies obtained the first large tracts of land in the desert to explore for oil, the American "Texaco" was also eager to get involved in Sahara oil. Under pressure from European monopoly capital, France refused to grant Americans leases in the Sahara.

    This was a fatal blow to the American oil tycoons. In the United States, people understand that if Sahara oil is controlled by France and Britain, it will be a terrible competitor to Middle Eastern oil. Americans earn huge profits from selling Middle Eastern oil in Western European countries. Therefore, it directly harms the power and income of the Rockefeller oil empire. On the other hand, as the French weekly "Carrefour" pointed out, the Americans are vying for the Sahara in order to have a "guarantee" in case they lose the Middle Eastern oilfields. In dealing with the Arabs, "the failure of the State Department's unwise policies has undermined" the security of the Middle Eastern oilfields.

    US monopoly capital began to prepare for a decisive battle.

    Negotiations held by French officials in Washington showed that the US State Department actively supports the interests of American oil monopoly organizations in Africa.

    At the same time, the Rockefeller Group's "Mobil Oil" tried every means to create tension on the borders of the Sahara in order to hinder the work of French oil companies. The United States used bribery of border tribal leaders to incite several major armed conflicts. The recent US supply of weapons to Tunisia is a new means of putting pressure on France.

    Pressure from US monopoly capital forced the French government to surrender. American oil giants have gained the right to participate in the exploitation of Sahara resources on favorable terms. The first batch of "independent" American oil companies participating in the development of the Sahara are: "Gulf Oil," "Phillips Petroleum," "Delhi Canadian Petroleum," "Franco American Petroleum," "Cities Service Oil," and "Global Oil." They have signed agreements with a full ten French oil companies to jointly explore and exploit Sahara oil.

    By the beginning of 1958, the United States had a firm foothold in the Sahara. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine said meaningfully that billions of barrels of oil were only the "minimum" that could be extracted from the discovered oilfields. The magazine's reporter reported from Hassi Messaoud: "The Americans have begun to flock."

    The negotiations held in Paris on February 1, 1958, between "Compagnie Française des Pétroles" and the Rockefeller's major oil monopoly "Standard Oil of New Jersey," came to an end. The issue was to establish a huge Franco-American joint venture to exploit oil in the eastern Sahara bordering Tunisia. All that remained was to wait for the French government's approval.

    The French government's reason for allowing British and American monopoly capital to enter the Sahara is the hope that this kind of "cooperation" will form a chain of guarantees between the United States, Britain, and France, so that the Algerian War can be successfully ended. But, will this wish come true? The British magazine "The Economist" emphasized in a long article on Sahara oil that British and American oil companies are not interested in protecting French sovereignty in the desert.

    At the beginning of 1958, the struggle to re-divide the Sahara entered a decisive stage: the five-year licenses for many promising oil leases belonging to French companies expired in January. US and British monopoly capital began a brutal struggle to obtain these leases. At the end of February, the head of the French government had already handed over the first five of these leases to American and British companies.

    "France Observateur" weekly wrote that not long ago, people still thought that Sahara oil could be kept in French hands. However, now people are facing the fact that American companies intend to gain a dominant position and want to "get rid of" any official control from the French side.

    垄断资本在撒哈拉的争夺战
    苏联　阿·鲍布罗夫斯基
    撒哈拉的富源
    五十年代初期，在撒哈拉开始了艰巨的地质勘查工作。法国垄断资本从叙利亚、黎巴嫩和印度支那被赶了出来，又在摩洛哥和突尼斯遭到美国人的排挤，于是便如饥似渴地在沙漠中寻找原料的新的来源。三、四年来在这里已经发现了位于科伦皮萨尔南部的科希克苏、司费雅和麦查里甫等煤田，杰别尔贝尔格和哈西鲁迈尔的天然煤气的产地，撒哈拉西北部的铁矿苗，以及铜、铅、锰等矿床。在霍嘎尔山中发现了铀、钨和锡。
    最后，在1956年发现了“黑金”——石油——的大矿床。目前驰名的两个大有前途的油田，一个在撒哈拉北部的哈西迈萨乌德，一个在同利比亚交界的艾杰勒附近。
    这两处油田的储藏量的估计数字其说不一，少者三亿吨，多者二、三十亿吨。但是，即使是最小限度的数字，对于法国垄断资本说来也是很有诱惑力的，因为法国本土及其殖民地的石油产量是微不足道的：1957年只有一百七十万吨。1958年法国将不得不从国外进口二千万吨煤和二千四百万吨石油，而且主要是用美元采购。然而，美元赤字正在绞杀法国财政和经济的生机。
    据估算，两年以后在撒哈拉能够开采出五百万吨铁矿石，七万吨精选的铜矿石，十五亿立方公尺的天然煤气，以及主要的一项产品石油约一千万吨。所有的钻探和勘查工作都在加速地进行中。已经敷设了一条从哈西迈萨乌德到地中海的输油管。
    不久以前，法国报纸对于在中央撒哈拉的新发现有所报道。比如，在霍嘎尔山脉发现了丰富的白金、钻石、镍等矿藏，有六个地质工作队在进行普查。
    瓜分大沙漠
    法属撒哈拉（约四百三十万平方公里），在法国的殖民地——阿尔及利亚、西非和赤道非洲——境内。不久以前，法国国民议会通过了建立“撒哈拉地区联合组织”的法案。这个组织负责主持开发撒哈拉沙漠富源的事宜。这个新成立的组织还拥有警察、军队和行政机构。
    法国政府把开发撒哈拉的一切非生产性开支列入国家预算之内。1958年用于勘探和开采撒哈拉石油方面的拨款，是八百七十亿法郎，超过预算中有关拨款的半数以上。
    大约有四十个法国公司在撒哈拉寻找石油。法国几家最大的银行（巴黎银行、印度支那银行、洛希尔银行、沃姆萨银行和拉萨尔兄弟银行）也参加了撒哈拉的“开发”工作。
    闯进撒哈拉的不仅有法国的垄断资本。英国的大石油康采恩“英荷壳牌石油公司”在“克莱普斯石油公司”中握有35％的资本。同一个康采恩还握有“阿尔及利亚石油公司”的65％的资本。“阿尔及利亚石油公司”在撒哈拉取得大片土地的租借权。另一个英国石油公司“不列颠石油公司”，握有“英法石油公司”的65％的资本。
    西德的垄断资本也对撒哈拉大沙漠十分感兴趣。有关“共同市场”的协定，为它开辟了参与对北非实行殖民奴役的实际可能性。
    到1957年年中，撒哈拉的瓜分基本上已告一段落：法国和英国的垄断资本瓜分了这块沙漠的富源。但是，它们正遇到一个劫掠成性的竞争对手。
    美国垄断资本的侵入
    美国很久以来一直企图渗入撒哈拉。五年前，当法国和英国的公司取得了在沙漠中勘探石油的最初的大片土地时，美国“德士古石油公司”，也急于要染指撒哈拉的石油。在欧洲垄断资本的压力下，法国拒绝在撒哈拉给美国人租借权。
    这对于美国的石油大王们是一个致命的打击。在美国，人们懂得撒哈拉石油一旦掌握在法国和英国的手里，将是中东石油的可怕的竞争者。美国人因在西欧各国销售中东石油而赚取大量的利润。由此，那就直接地损害了洛克菲勒石油帝国的权力和收入。另一方面，正如法国“十字路口”周刊所指出的，美国人争夺撒哈拉，是为了在一旦失掉中东油田的时候有个“保障”。在对待阿拉伯人的关系中，“国务院的不明智的政策的失败，破坏了”中东油田的安全。
    美国垄断资本开始准备决定性的一战。
    法国官方人士在华盛顿举行的谈判表明，美国国务院积极支持美国石油垄断组织在非洲的利益。
    同时，洛克菲勒集团的“美孚油公司”千方百计地在撒哈拉的边界上制造紧张局势，以便阻止法国石油公司的工作。美国使用贿赂边境部落领袖的手段，挑起数起大的武装冲突。不久以前美国向突尼斯供应武器，是对法国施加压力的新手段。
    美国垄断资本的压力迫使法国政府投降了。美国石油巨头获得了在有利的条件下参加开采撒哈拉富源的权利。第一批参加开发撒哈拉的“独立的”美国大石油公司有：“海湾石油公司”、“菲力浦石油公司”、“加拿大德里石油公司”、“法美石油公司”、“城市服务石油公司”、“环球石油公司”。它们同整整十个法国石油公司签订了共同勘探和开采撒哈拉石油的协定。
    到1958年初，美国在撒哈拉已经有了牢固的阵地。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志意味深长地说，上十亿大桶的石油，不过是从已发现的油田中所能唧取的石油的“最低限额”而已。这家杂志的记者从哈西迈萨乌德报道说：“美国人已经开始云集。”
    1958年2月1日在巴黎举行的“法国石油公司”和洛克菲勒的大石油垄断组织“新泽西美孚油公司”的谈判，宣告结束。问题是要在开采同突尼斯交界的东撒哈拉石油方面建立一个巨大的法美联营组织。剩下只是等法国政府的批准了。
    法国政府之所以允许英美垄断资本进入撒哈拉，是指望这类的“合作”会在美、英、法之间结成连环保，从而可以顺利地结束阿尔及利亚战争。但是，能否如愿以偿呢？英国“经济学人”杂志在一篇关于撒哈拉石油的长文章中着重指出，英美石油公司对于保护法国在沙漠的主权不感兴趣。
    1958年初，重新分割撒哈拉的斗争进入了决定性的阶段：属于法国公司的许多大有前途的石油租借权的为期五年的许可证已于1月份届满。美英垄断资本为取得这种租借权而开始了残酷的斗争。2月末，法国政府的首脑已经把其中首批的五处租借权交给了美国和英国的公司。
    “法兰西观察家”周刊写道，在不久以前，人们还认为撒哈拉的石油可以保持在法国的手里。但是，现在人们正视这样一个事实，即美国公司打算取得统治地位，并且想“摆脱”来自法国方面的任何的官方控制。
