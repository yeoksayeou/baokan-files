    The Downward Transfer of Cadres in Czechoslovakia
    By Our Correspondent Yang Yi
    While improving the management, planning, and financial work of the national economy, Czechoslovakia is currently beginning a large-scale adjustment of state organs at all levels, streamlining and transferring personnel from government agencies. The great significance of this action is not merely limited to tightening staffing and saving expenses, but more importantly, it constitutes a crucial link in improving the effectiveness of the entire national economy.
    The streamlining of state organs in Czechoslovakia is generally carried out by dividing the various agencies into three types.
    The first to be streamlined are the central departments managing production, including the central ministries of industry, transportation, and construction, their subordinate general administrations, and the corresponding bureaus of the Slovak Administrative Council. These departments will reduce their staff by 54%, totaling approximately 7,500 people. The Ministry of Food Industry and Agricultural Products Procurement plans to reduce its staff by 78%, which, together with its subordinate administrative and production units, will reduce more than 8,000 people. The Ministry of Heavy Machinery Industry can reduce its staff by 59%. The Ministry of Chemical Industry will reduce half of its staff, and the Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry will reduce its staff by 58%. The Ministry of Construction Industry will reduce 54%. The streamlining of these departments is expected to be completed by the end of June.
    The second type of department to be streamlined includes the ministries of agriculture, health, local economy, and education and culture, whose powers will be partially transferred to people's committees at all levels. At the same time, as the work and authority of the county and township people's committees will be greatly increased, the institutions of the state people's committees will also be correspondingly tightened.
    The third type to be streamlined includes other central economic and administrative departments, such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of State Supervision, the State Planning Commission, and the State Construction Commission.
    The streamlining of the second and third types of institutions will be completed within this year.
    This institutional streamlining is being carried out under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. All central agencies have established specialized committees jointly composed of party, administrative, and trade union representatives, responsible for the streamlining and downward transfer of cadres in their respective agencies according to the established staffing levels. Some of the streamlined cadres will be introduced to other departments, and some will be transferred to strengthen the leadership of enterprises, but the majority will go to work in areas severely lacking labor. Due to the strong vitality of the socialist system and the constantly rising demands of the national economy, in today's Czechoslovakia, full employment is not only no longer a problem, but there is also a shortage of labor, especially in coal mining, transportation, construction, and agriculture, which urgently need to be supplemented. Some remote provinces, such as Karlovy Vary and Ústí nad Labem, also need a large amount of labor.
    The Czechoslovak Communist Party and government attach great importance to this institutional streamlining, and have conducted thorough investigations and research, as well as made proper arrangements and accommodations. The leaders of each unit are responsible for conducting individual talks with all staff members who are about to leave their posts and arranging their future work.
    The party organizations and trade unions will fully realize their supervisory and guaranteeing role in this movement. The party and trade unions will supervise the administrative leaders to correctly and promptly implement the Central Committee's instructions on streamlining institutions, ensuring that the work is carried out fairly and reasonably, and preventing any acts of favoritism or illegality. At the same time, the party and trade unions must explain the significance and necessity of streamlining and reorganization to those who have just arrived at their new positions, give them comrade-like care, so that they can quickly settle down and become outstanding members of the new collective.
    The new measures of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government to reorganize the economy, as well as the work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward, are undoubtedly major actions that meet practical needs and promote production development, and therefore have aroused a very enthusiastic response among the broad masses of working people. In the nationwide discussion, the working masses expressed their full support for these measures, and put forward hundreds of thousands of suggestions and criticisms, greatly enriching and perfecting the principles and steps put forward by the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party last October.

    捷克斯洛伐克的干部下放
    本报记者　杨翊
    在改善国民经济管理、计划和财务工作的同时，捷克斯洛伐克目前正开始大规模调整各级国家机构，精简和下放机关工作人员。这一行动的巨大意义决不仅仅限于紧缩编制和节约开支，更主要的是它构成了提高整个国民经济效果的一个重要环节。
    捷克斯洛伐克的国家机构精简工作，大体上把各机关分成三种类型进行。
    首先精简的是中央管理生产的部门，包括工业、交通、建筑系统的中央各部和它们所辖的总管理局以及斯洛伐克行政委员会的各相应局。这些部门将精简工作人员的54％，总数约七千五百人。食品工业和农产品采购部计划减少该部工作人员的78％，加上该部所辖行政和生产单位，共可精简八千多人。重型机械工业部工作人员可精简59％。化学工业部将精简一半工作人员，消费品工业部将精简工作人员的58％。建筑工业部54％。这些部门的精简工作预期在6月底以前完成。
    第二类要精简的部门包括农业、卫生、地方经济和教育文化等部，它们的职权一部分将转交给各级人民委员会。同时由于县和乡人民委员会的工作和权限都将较前增加许多，州人民委员会的机构也将相应紧缩。
    第三类待精简的是其他中央经济和行政部门，如财政部、国家监察部、国家计划委员会、国家建设委员会等。
    第二类和第三类机构的精简工作将在今年内完成。
    这次机构精简工作是在捷共中央直接领导下进行的，所有中央机关都成立了由党、行政、工会等联合组成的专门委员会，根据已经确定的编制，负责本机关的精简和干部下放工作。精简下来的干部，一部分将介绍给其他部门，一部分将下放以加强企业的领导，但大多数人员将要到严重缺少劳动力的地区去工作。由于社会主义制度的强大生命力，由于国民经济不断高涨的要求，在今天的捷克斯洛伐克，全民就业不仅已完全不成问题，而且还感到劳动力的不足，特别是采煤、运输、建筑和农业方面，亟需补充；一些边远省份，如卡罗维发利、乌斯提等州，也需要大量劳动力。
    捷共和政府对于这次机构精简工作十分重视，作了充分的调查研究工作和妥善的照顾、安置。每个单位的领导人有责任同所有将要离职的工作人员进行个别谈话，安排他们未来的工作。
    党组织和工会在这一运动中将充分实现监督和保证的作用。党和工会将监督行政领导正确和迅速贯彻党中央关于精简机构的指示，保证工作进行得公平合理，制止任何徇私违法的行为。同时党和工会要向那些刚刚来到新岗位的工作人员解释精简整编的意义和必要，给予他们同志式的关怀，使他们很快安定下来，成为新的集体的优秀一员。
    捷克斯洛伐克党和政府改组经济的新措施以及精简机构和下放干部的工作，无疑是切合实际需要和促进生产发展的重大行动，因此在广大劳动人民中激起了十分热烈的反应。在全民讨论中，劳动群众表示完全拥护这些措施，并提出了几十万条建议和批评，大大丰富和完善了捷共中央去年10月提出的原则和步骤。
