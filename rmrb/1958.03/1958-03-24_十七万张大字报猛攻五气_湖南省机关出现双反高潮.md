In the "Double-Anti" movement, the vast majority of responsible persons in Hunan Province's provincial organs personally took command and went deep to mobilize the masses. Middle-level backbone cadres were also able to lead by example and take the lead in speaking out freely. For example, Li Tiefeng, Director of the Broadcasting Station, wrote seven big-character posters before mobilizing the masses, expressing his determination to vehemently attack the "five qi," resolutely drawing fire upon himself, and proposed the slogans of "three diligences" (diligent in inspection, diligent in research, diligent in solving) and "three sames" (same in speaking out freely, same in debate, same in improvement). Leading cadres of the Provincial Department of Culture specifically set up "drawing fire upon oneself furnaces" in order to encourage the masses to boldly speak out. Leading cadres of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau decided to spend two afternoons each week gathering cadres at the section chief level and above to focus on studying the movement's situation, study relevant documents, and go deep into the departments and groups to specifically grasp and guide the movement.

Under the impetus of leading cadres taking the initiative to draw fire upon themselves, the "Double-Anti" movement in Hunan Province's provincial organs has formed a wave of free speech. In just a few days, more than 170,000 big-character posters were posted, exposing waste, conservatism, and the "five qi" from all aspects. For the problems exposed, many units have implemented rectification while correcting, and made emergency rescues for some major wastes. For example, the Design Company of the Provincial Urban Construction Bureau immediately organized forces to modify the designs of nine projects that had not yet been constructed or were under construction, based on the masses' exposure, which can save the state more than 160,000 yuan. This approach has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the masses to continue to speak out freely. At present, all units are about to usher in a new upsurge of systematic rectification with debate as the main focus.

    十七万张大字报猛攻五气
    湖南省机关出现双反高潮
    在“双反”运动中，湖南省绝大多数省级机关的负责人，都做到了亲自挂帅出马，深入发动群众。中层骨干干部，也都能以身作则，带头鸣放。如广播电台台长李铁峰在向群众动员之前，就写了七张大字报，表示决心痛击“五气”，坚决引火烧身，并提出“三勤”（勤检查、勤研究、勤解决）和“三同”（同鸣放、同辩论、同改进）的口号。省文化局的领导干部，为了鼓励群众大胆鸣放，专门设立“引火烧身炉”。有色局的领导干部决定每周抽出两个下午召集处长以上干部集中研究运动情况，学习有关文件，并深入科室小组，具体掌握，指导运动。
    在领导干部主动引火烧身的推动之下，湖南省省级机关的“双反”运动已形成鸣放热潮，在短短的几天中就贴出了十七万张以上的大字报，从各方面揭发了浪费、保守和“五气”。对于揭发出来的问题，许多单位都实行边整边改，对一些重大的浪费还作了紧急抢救。如省城市建设局设计公司，根据群众的揭发，立即组织力量对未施工或正施工的九个工程设计进行了修改，可以节约国家资金十六万多元。这种作法对鼓舞群众继续鸣放的热情起了很大作用。目前各单位即将掀起一个以辩论为主的系统整改的新高潮。
