    The Beautiful Pieniny Valley

    Nestled amidst the precipitous cliffs of the Pieniny Mountains lies a valley carved out by the Dunajec River, considered by many to be the most magnificent and picturesque natural wonder on the European continent.

    Limestone ridges, like a silvery ribbon, stretch along the northwest of the towering Carpathian Mountains, bordering Poland and Czechoslovakia. The Dunajec River originates from the majestic peaks of the Tatra Mountains. As the river carves its way northward through the Pieniny Mountains, it creates an exceptionally beautiful and rare natural scene. This winding river, snaking through the mountains, forms a long and deep canyon, meandering like a chain or a semi-circular arch, the gurgling sound of the Dunajec River echoing between the cliffs. The river's course is so tortuous that while a crow could fly the distance from the canyon's entrance to its exit in a mere three kilometers, the water must travel nine kilometers.

    The structure of the Pieniny Mountains themselves is quite unique and interesting. It is as if they are a miniature version of grand mountain ranges, as even the most rugged peaks do not exceed one thousand meters above sea level. However, the captivating beauty of the soaring cliffs, the extraordinary scenery, or the unforgettable impression left in your mind as you raft through the rapids of the gorge on wooden rafts specially crafted by the mountain people for travelers, will surely remain with you.

    At the foot of the Pieniny Mountains, scattered like brocade, are charming villages, scenic spas, and the remains of intriguing medieval structures. Near the small town of Czorsztyn, at the first bend of the Dunajec River, one can see the ruins of a castle built by King Casimir the Great in the 14th century. Looking further afield, on a steep hill near Krościenko, the walls of another medieval castle stand tall. Built in the early 14th century, it was later renovated, and after the First World War, the castle was rebuilt again and converted into the headquarters of the Art History Society.

    At the exit of the Dunajec River valley, along the cool and tranquil streams, villas are scattered like stars. This is Szczawnica - one of the oldest mineral spring resorts in Poland. A little further down, by the river, lies the small town and spa of Krościenko, which boasts an ancient church built in the 15th century, featuring fragments of frescoes and a stone baptismal font.

    Under the protection of Polish government laws, the natural beauty of the Pieniny Valley is well-maintained, making it a paradise for the working people to visit and relax.
                                                                                                    (Li)

### 秀丽的巴宁山谷

    秀丽的巴宁山谷
    在悬崖陡壁的巴宁山间，有一个被杜纳依茨河水冲刷着的山谷，人们认为它是欧洲大陆上最宏伟、最秀丽的天然奇迹。
    石灰石的山岭像一根银白色的丝带，绵延在高大的喀尔巴阡山的西北，紧靠着波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的边境。杜纳依茨河就发源于高耸的塔特尔高峰。河水穿过巴宁山向北奔流，形成一幅稀有的奇丽的天然图景。这条弯曲的河川穿过丛山峻岭，构成了一条悠长而深遂的峡谷，迂回曲折，有的地方宛如链索，有的则如半边圆拱，在断崖峭壁间响彻杜纳依茨河潺潺的流水声。河道曲折多弯，以致从峡谷的进口到出口的这段路程，乌鸦飞行不过三公里，而河水却奔流了九公里之多。
    巴宁山本身的结构是十分奇特有趣的。它仿佛是高山峻岭的缩影，因为其中最险峻的山峰也还没有高过拔海一千公尺。但是高耸的峭壁的迷人的美景，出奇的风光，或则当你驾着山地居民为旅行者专门设制的木筏，漂过这儿峡谷里的激流的时候，你在脑海中将会留下难忘的印象。
    在巴宁山脚下，散布着疏疏落落如锦似画的村落和水碧山青的疗养地以及有趣的中世纪建筑物的遗迹。在杜纳依茨河第一个转弯处，乔尔斯顿小镇的附近，人们可以看到由卡基米札大帝在十四世纪时建筑的城堡的废墟。再往远方了望，可以看到在?特齐茨附近一座陡立的岗峦上，另一个中世纪城堡的围墙巍然高耸，它是在十四世纪初期建立的，后来曾经一度改建，第一次世界大战以后，这个城堡又一次得到了重建，并且把它辟为艺术历史学会的会址。
    在杜纳依茨河河谷的出口处，沿着清凉幽静的溪涧，幢幢别墅，星罗棋布。这里是萨夫尼查——波兰最古老的矿泉疗养地之一。稍稍往下一些，靠河有一个小镇和疗养地克洛斯琴科，这里有在十五世纪时建筑的古老的教堂，里面有壁画残片和石砌的洗礼盘。
    在波兰政府法律的保护下，巴宁山谷的天然美景得到了良好的维护，成了劳动人民游览和休息的乐园。　　　　　　　　　　（黎）
