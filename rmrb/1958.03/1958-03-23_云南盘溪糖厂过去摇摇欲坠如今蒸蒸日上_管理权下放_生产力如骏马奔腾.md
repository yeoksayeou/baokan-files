Yunnan Panxi Sugar Factory, Once Teetering on the Brink, Now Thriving
Decentralization of Management Powers Unleashes Productive Forces Like Galloping Horses
Shifting from Provincial to County Management Fully Mobilizes Local Enthusiasm for Industrial Operations

(This article is a translation of news from the People's Daily on March 23, 1958)

Our Newspaper Reports: The Yunnan Provincial State-Owned Panxi Sugar Factory, after being placed under the management of Huaning County, has fully utilized local enthusiasm for industrial operations and favorable conditions, established close cooperation with agricultural cooperatives, implemented the policy of serving agricultural production, transformed from a "single-product factory" into a "multi-purpose factory," and undergone a complete transformation, with production thriving. This factory, which previously incurred losses year after year, is now generating substantial profits.

The Panxi Sugar Factory is a mechanized sugar factory newly built in 1955, originally under the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry. Due to the "long arm of the law not reaching," the Provincial Department of Industry lacked specific guidance and assistance for this factory. The factory's leaders, self-identifying as being under provincial leadership, neither listened to the opinions of the local Party committee nor cooperated with agricultural cooperatives, and were detached from the factory's workers. Therefore, the factory's production was backward, incurring losses year after year, teetering on the brink of collapse.

Since its establishment, this factory had encountered two problems: insufficient raw material supply and uneven production workload, but they had never been properly resolved. The factory had a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 150 tons, and with a production season of four months per year, it could crush 18,000 tons of sugarcane. However, there was simply not that much sugarcane locally, so it had to be transported from distant areas. This required eight trucks dedicated to transportation every day, or more than fifty carts if using horse-drawn carriages, which affected production costs. Sugar factory production is seasonal; after the crushing season, all 260-plus employees, except for a few who repaired the machinery, had nothing to do. In 1956 alone, "shutdown maintenance costs" amounted to over 97,000 yuan.

The factory's original leaders sat in the office issuing orders by telephone, visiting the workshop only a few times during the entire crushing season. They neither understood production within the factory nor investigated raw material production. When formulating production plans, they completely ignored the local sugarcane yield and maturity period. In January and February, when sugarcane had not yet matured in large quantities, the factory often suspended operations waiting for materials; in March and April, when large quantities of sugarcane were transported in, it could not be crushed in time. In 1956, more than 2,000 tons of sugarcane were stacked for too long, resulting in reduced sugar content, with a loss of over 100,000 yuan from this item alone.

To fully mobilize the county's enthusiasm and favorable conditions for operating local industries, in May 1957, the Panxi Sugar Factory was placed under the management of Huaning County. The Huaning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party appointed Wang Hongqing, a member of the county committee, and Chen Chunfu, the secretary of the district committee, as the factory director and branch secretary, respectively, and put the issue of changing the factory's backward situation on the work agenda. Any problems were immediately studied and resolved. For example, when sugarcane supply was insufficient in January and February this year, the county committee held a meeting to discuss and instructed the district committees and township branches to strengthen education on the worker-peasant alliance in agricultural cooperatives. As a result, the agricultural cooperatives quickly delivered sugarcane to the factory. With raw materials secured, the factory overfulfilled the state plan by 27.7% in January and February.

From the first day of their arrival, the new factory director and Party branch secretary went deep into the workshops to understand the problems and solve them. For example, regarding the sugarcane supply problem, they convened a symposium with township branch secretaries and agricultural cooperative directors to jointly devise solutions. The agricultural cooperatives decided to supply first-year sugarcane in January and February, and second-year sugarcane in March and April. Many agricultural cooperatives also guaranteed to cut and deliver sugarcane immediately, without stacking it. This solved the factory's problem of uneven production workload during the sugarcane crushing season. The factory also consulted with agricultural cooperatives on employing temporary workers. During the factory's busy crushing season, agricultural cooperatives supported the factory with eighty members as temporary workers to reduce the factory's long-term labor costs.

To increase the income of agricultural cooperatives, and also to avoid transporting sugarcane from distant areas, the factory opened sugarcane experimental fields, planting more than ten high-yield varieties. On the one hand, they invited representatives from agricultural cooperatives to visit the high-yield sugarcane fields; on the other hand, they sent technicians to the sugarcane production areas to guide farmers in planting. After seven townships planted high-yield sugarcane, the yield increased from the original 700-800 jin per mu to over 18,000 jin per mu. Due to the promotion and increased yield of high-yield sugarcane varieties, many agricultural cooperatives also voluntarily expressed their willingness to lower the sugarcane price.

During the agricultural production upsurge, the Panxi Sugar Factory conscientiously implemented the policy of facing the countryside and serving agricultural production. They dismantled nine telephone sets and took out unused rails, mine cars, and chutes from the factory to support water conservancy projects. When the factory's carts were idle, they also helped agricultural cooperatives transport goods. The employees also used their spare time to help farmers build water conservancy projects, dig ponds, accumulate fertilizer, and repair farm tools in nearby agricultural cooperatives. They also jointly established an iron factory with the local iron farm tool cooperative to help agricultural cooperatives repair farm tools.

To fully tap its potential, the factory also used sugarcane residue as raw material to build a distillery and a paper mill with a semi-annual production of 600 tons of paper, using the idle time after the crushing season for production. In addition, they organized surplus labor to mine gypsum, phosphate fertilizer, and other minerals in the mountains.

After the Panxi Sugar Factory was placed under the management of Huaning County, in addition to remitting 160,000 yuan of profit to the state last year, it also earned more than 200,000 yuan. This year, the total output value will also increase from 1,957,000 yuan last year to 4,198,000 yuan.

This practice of the Panxi Sugar Factory is widely welcomed by the local agricultural cooperatives. The farmers believe that "this is a real factory that serves agricultural cooperatives."

    云南盘溪糖厂过去摇摇欲坠如今蒸蒸日上
    管理权下放　生产力如骏马奔腾
    由省管变县管充分发挥了当地经营工业的积极性
    本报讯　云南省地方国营盘溪糖厂，下放归华宁县管理后，充分发挥了当地经营工业的积极性和便利条件，建立了同农业社的密切协作，贯彻执行了为农业生产服务的方针，变“单一生产工厂”为
  “万能工厂”，面貌焕然一新，生产蒸蒸日上。这个厂过去年年亏本，现在大大赢余。
    盘溪糖厂是1955年新建的一座机榨糖厂，原来归云南省工业厅领导。由于“鞭长莫及”，省工业厅对这个工厂缺少具体的指导和帮助。这个工厂的领导人自以为是归省领导的，既不听当地党委的意见，也不同农业社协作，又脱离本厂工人群众。因此，工厂生产落后，年年亏本，摇摇欲坠。
    这个工厂建立以来就遇到原料供应不足和生产忙闲不均两个问题，但是始终没有得到妥善的解决。全厂日榨甘蔗一百五十吨，一年的生产季节以四个月计算，可榨甘蔗一万八千吨；可是当地根本没有这么多的甘蔗，就不得不到较远的地方去运。每天需要八辆汽车专运，如用马车就要五十多部，这就影响了生产成本。糖厂的生产是有季节性的，榨季过后，全厂二百六十多名职工，除少数人员检修机器外，就只能闲着。1956年仅“停工维持费”就支出了九万七千多元。
    工厂原来的领导人，光坐在办公室里用电话发号施令，一个榨季之中只有几次去车间，既不了解厂内生产，也不调查原料生产情况。他们在编制生产计划时，根本不顾当地甘蔗的产量和成熟期。1、2月份甘蔗没有大量成熟时，厂里往往停工待料；到3、4月份大量甘蔗运来后，又榨不完。1956年就曾有二千多吨甘蔗因堆存过久而降低了糖分，仅此一项就损失了十万多元。
    为了充分发挥县经营地方工业的积极性和便利条件，1957年5月盘溪糖厂下放归华宁县管理。中共华宁县委会派了县委委员王鸿庆和区委书记陈春福分别担任厂长和支部书记，还把改变这个厂的落后面貌的问题提上了工作日程，有什么问题，立即研究解决。例如今年1、2月份甘蔗供应不上，县委就开会讨论，责成各区委和各乡支部对各农业社加强工农联盟的教育。结果，各农业社很快的就把甘蔗送到工厂来了。原料有了着落，这个厂在1、2月份就超额27.7％完成了国家计划。
    新厂长和党支部书记到厂的第一天起就深入车间，了解问题，解决问题。例如对甘蔗的供应问题，他们召开了乡支书和农业社长座谈会，共同想出了解决的办法。各农业社决定1、2月间砍头年甘蔗来供应，3、4月间砍二年甘蔗来供应。很多农业社还保证随砍随送，不堆存甘蔗。这样就使工厂解决了在榨糖季节生产忙闲不均的问题。这个厂还同农业社商定了雇用临时工的办法。在工厂榨季生产忙的时候，各农业社支援八十个社员来厂作临时工，以减少工厂长年工的开支。
    为了增加农业社收入，同时为了不再从远处运输甘蔗，这个工厂开辟了甘蔗试验田，种植了十多种高产品种，一方面邀请农业社代表参观高产甘蔗，另方面还派出技术人员到各甘蔗产区指导农民种植。有七个乡种植高产甘蔗后，都由原来的亩产七、八百斤增至一万八千多斤。由于甘蔗高产品种的推广和产量的增加，很多农业社还自动表示愿意降低甘蔗售价。
    在农业生产高潮中，盘溪糖厂认真地贯彻了面向农村，为农业生产服务的方针。他们拆下了九部电话机，并把厂里用不着的铁轨、地车、飞兜等都拿出来，支援水利工程。厂里的马车在闲着的时候，还帮农业社拉东西。职工们也利用空闲时间到附近农业社帮农民修水利，挖塘，积肥，修理农具。他们并同当地铁农具社联合成立了一个铁工厂，帮助农业社修补农具。
    为了充分发挥潜力，这个工厂还利用甘蔗渣子作原料，建立了一座酿酒厂和一座半年产纸六百吨的造纸厂，利用榨季后的空闲时间进行生产。此外还组织了多余的劳动力到山上挖石膏、磷肥和采矿。
    盘溪糖厂归华宁县管理后，去年除向国家上缴了十六万元的利润外，还赚了二十多万元。今年总产值还将由去年的一百九十五万七千元增至四百一十九万八千元。
    盘溪糖厂这种作法，受到当地农业社的普遍欢迎。农民们认为“这才是真正的为农业社服务的工厂。”（附图片）
