Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 15th: Khrushchev, candidate for the Soviet Supreme Soviet and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, met with over 10,000 voters from the Kalinin constituency in Moscow at the Lenin Stadium in Luzhniki on the afternoon of the 14th and delivered a speech.

After the voters' meeting began, many voter representatives spoke, expressing their pride in the construction achievements of the Soviet state in all aspects. They fully demonstrated the unanimous support of their candidate and the political and moral unity of all voters. Voter representatives expressed their intention to vote for their beloved candidate, Comrade Khrushchev, on the 16th.

The meeting lasted more than three hours. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union also attended the meeting.

TASS, Moscow, March 15th: Khrushchev, candidate for the Soviet Supreme Soviet and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, addressed issues related to the achievements of Soviet national economic construction, Soviet foreign policy, and the international situation in his speech at the voters' meeting in the Kalinin constituency of Moscow on the 14th.

The Soviet Union now possesses all the conditions to successfully carry out communist construction

In his speech, Khrushchev reviewed the achievements of Soviet national economic construction over the past four years. He pointed out that the Soviet Union is now able to produce more industrial products in one year than it could produce in fifteen to twenty years after the establishment of the Soviet regime. Khrushchev said that this is a qualitative leap, which convincingly demonstrates how our country has changed. Now we have the ability to complete any huge and complex task. All the Soviet republics have become advanced, industrially developed socialist republics. Any republic can compete with many capitalist countries in terms of economic development. Khrushchev pointed out that the scale of Soviet capital construction is also expanding year by year. Currently, no country in the world can compare with the Soviet Union in terms of the scale of capital construction. Soviet agriculture is also developing at a rapid pace and will catch up with the United States in terms of per capita production of meat, fats, and dairy products in the coming years.

With the development of the economy, the material well-being of the Soviet people is also constantly improving. National income increases year by year. The terrible disaster of unemployment for workers has become a thing of the past in the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that the past four years have marked new brilliant achievements in Soviet science and technology and a further upsurge in culture. Not long ago, some pretentious figures in the Western world insisted that the Soviet Union was lagging behind the United States in science and technology. Now the whole world recognizes the great achievements of the Soviet Union. But we must not be complacent with what we have already achieved, but must work harder and more stubbornly to solve the main economic tasks facing us, so that our country can be ahead of mankind in all areas of life.

Khrushchev then pointed out that the Soviet Union now possesses all the conditions to successfully solve the task of building communism. Relying on existing achievements and utilizing the superiority of the socialist economic system, the Soviet Union will further rapidly increase the production of metals, coal, electricity, machinery manufacturing, the chemical industry, and other sectors, so as to not only catch up with but also surpass those largest capitalist countries in the production of important products per capita in the next fifteen years. The production of important industrial sectors will roughly expand two to three times in the next fifteen years, and agriculture will also make further great leaps forward, which will greatly improve the well-being of the Soviet people and more fully meet their material and cultural needs.

Khrushchev said that the Party and the government have formulated a grand plan for the development of housing construction to eliminate the housing shortage in the country in the next ten to twelve years, and this plan is being implemented. The number of houses built in 1957 alone was more than that built during the entire Second Five-Year Plan period. If the houses built nationwide in 1954 could provide an average of seven units per thousand residents, then in 1957, an average of 10.2 new houses could be provided per thousand residents. This greatly exceeds the amount of construction in capitalist countries. According to official data, in 1957, the United States built 6.7 new houses per thousand people, Britain built 5.9, and France built 6.2. Khrushchev spoke about the task of accelerating the speed of housing construction and ensuring the quality of construction, and the shortcomings in housing allocation must be overcome. At the same time, the continued growth of the population in large cities due to the influx of population from other regions of the country must be prevented. He also criticized the mistake of some architects who emphasized building high-rise buildings. He said that in urban construction, the important thing is not the height of the buildings, but the ability to rationally design cities, correctly build blocks, and make good use of local topography and scenery. All of these affect the cost of construction. These conditions must be taken into account to determine how many floors of housing are economically viable.

Khrushchev said that in recent years, the production of consumer goods in the Soviet Union has greatly increased, and people are eating and dressing better. However, there are still some difficulties that must be overcome in this regard. Our task is to increase the production of shoes, textiles, clothing, and other daily necessities, so as to ensure the demand of the Soviet people for these items in the next five to seven years, and at the same time, to improve their quality.

The Soviet people actively participate in political, economic, and cultural aspects of life, whereas the situation is different in capitalist countries.

Khrushchev then said that the Soviet Union has been able to achieve all these achievements because we live under a socialist system, where the people have become the full masters of their own country and participate most actively in political, economic, and cultural aspects of life.

The Soviet working people are very concerned about electing the best sons and daughters of the people as representatives. Therefore, our people regard the Supreme Soviet elections as their own business. Almost all voters go to the polls.

Khrushchev pointed out that the situation is completely different in capitalist countries. For example, in the most recent election of the U.S. Congress, only 57.3% of people of voting age voted, and in the 1954 congressional election, only 42.5% of people voted. In the most recent election of the British House of Commons, only 26,760,000 people voted out of 34,852,000 voters. These figures show that the voters in these countries have seen through the fact that no matter which representative of the ruling class is elected to Congress or Parliament, these representatives will protect the interests of the ruling class such as capitalists, bankers, landlords, and big businessmen. For example, more than half of the current 531 members of the U.S. Congress are lawyers, and a quarter are business owners and bankers. There are no real representatives of workers and farmers in the U.S. Congress. Among the 10.4% of the U.S. population who are Black, only three are members of Congress. Only seventeen women were elected to the U.S. Congress.

However, in the Soviet Union, among the 1,378 candidates for the Soviet Supreme Soviet election registered this time, 614 are workers and collective farm members who directly participate in production; in terms of social status, more than 60% are workers and peasants, and the rest are representatives of the working intellectuals. Among the candidates, 26.4% are women. These materials reflect true Soviet democracy.

Khrushchev pointed out that the defenders of capitalism like to portray the United States as a prosperous country, a model of bourgeois freedom and bourgeois democracy. However, in the United States, a small group of millionaires and billionaires reap huge profits from the suffering of the people, while millions of working people have to waste their energy year after year looking for work to support their children and elderly parents. At the same time, the U.S. government spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build military bases, while remaining indifferent to the suffering of the people. This is the true face of capitalist prosperity! This is so-called capitalist freedom!

The socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong. The Soviet Union defends peace with practical actions and has made many new friends in recent years.

Khrushchev then talked about some issues concerning the international situation. He said that we can be satisfied with the Soviet Union's international environment. In the past four years, we have not only not lost a friend abroad, but have further strengthened our friendship with them, and have made many new friends. The Soviet Union's international prestige has grown immeasurably. Its ties with many countries in the world have expanded and strengthened.

Due to the brilliant victories achieved by the Soviet people and the people of all socialist countries, and due to the cooperation and mutual assistance of these countries, the socialist camp has been unprecedentedly strengthened, the world socialist system has been consolidated, and it has become a powerful force.

The imperialists have tried more than once to undermine the solidarity of the socialist camp, and they have tried at any cost to alienate socialist countries and instigate them to quarrel with each other. However, the people of the socialist countries are fighting back and will continue to fight back against all reactionary forces. The working people of these countries are well aware that only the unity of all socialist countries can guarantee the social fruits and national independence of the working people.

Khrushchev said that the big family of socialist countries is not exclusive. In the past four years, the Soviet Union has strengthened friendly ties with India, Indonesia, Burma, the United Arab Republic, and other countries in Asia and Africa. The Soviet Union, together with other peace-loving countries, has made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, stop the arms race, and prevent new wars.

Khrushchev then said that for all mankind, the most urgent issue now is the issue of war and peace. Peace, and the prevention of the heavy disasters that new wars may bring, is the decisive condition for mankind to move forward along the road of progress today.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have been making various efforts to prevent new wars and promote the development of international relations along the path of maintaining lasting peace. Everything they do is to strive for peace in action rather than in words, and to strive for equal relations and friendship between the peoples of all countries.

Khrushchev reviewed some of the most important diplomatic measures taken by the Soviet Union in the past four years to ease international tensions. He said that all honest people can see that only countries that want peace and not war, that do not want to intensify international tensions but want to normalize international tensions, can take these measures.

The Soviet Union's good-neighborly policy has achieved great results. The Soviet Union is paying close attention to the imperialists' conspiracy in Indonesia.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union insists on establishing good-neighborly relations with all countries without exception, and we are ready to establish such relations with all countries that have this desire on an equal footing.

We treat Turkey with good intentions, but unfortunately, we have not yet received its necessary understanding. However, despite some unfriendly anti-Soviet remarks made by certain political figures in Turkey, our relations with Turkey are no longer what they were four years ago, and there is a tendency towards improvement in our mutual relations. We will spare no effort to continue to implement a policy of peace, and hope that the Turkish people and the Turkish government can understand our good and sincere intentions.

The border dispute between the Soviet Union and Iran, which had been protracted for hundreds of years, has now been resolved to mutual satisfaction. We are now negotiating with Iran on certain economic issues. The satisfactory resolution of these issues will be beneficial to the development of good-neighborly relations between our two countries. We have declared to the Iranian government that the Soviet Union has not had and does not have any unfriendly intentions towards Iran. We believe that the Iranian government will be convinced of this.

The Soviet Union's relations with Afghanistan have been better and more consolidated in recent years than before.

In recent years, our country has established friendly relations with the Republic of Indonesia. The Soviet people cannot but pay attention to the imperialists' conspiracy in Indonesia. Why are they trying to interfere in the internal affairs of this country and create conspiracies there? This cannot be allowed. The Indonesian people want to build their own lives according to their own wishes, and no one has the right to force the Indonesian people to accept their own will and a system that does not suit them.

For reasons beyond the Soviet Union's control, relations between the Soviet Union and Pakistan and some other countries in Asia have not improved, because these countries have been dragged into the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization by the imperialists, and it is impossible not to express regret about this.

The Soviet Union's good and neighborly relations with Finland and other Scandinavian countries are developing. We value the neutrality of Sweden, which hopes not to participate in military blocs. The Soviet Union respects the diplomatic policy steps taken by the Norwegian government headed by Gerhardsen and the Danish government headed by Hansen, which oppose the establishment of devices for launching atomic and rocket weapons on their own territories.

Our country's relations with neutral Austria have been normalized after the conclusion of the State Treaty and are developing in a spirit of good neighborliness.

We have great possibilities for improving relations with Italy and Greece. Of course, we cannot but take into account that influential people in these two countries are not listening more to the voices of their own people, but are more echoing the arguments of the NATO generals, and at the same time, according to newspaper reports, they have begun to prepare to establish American rocket bases in their own countries. However, we believe in the reason of the Italian and Greek people.

In terms of the Soviet Union's relations with Latin American countries, there are some significant signs of improvement. We are not responsible for the fact that the Soviet Union has not yet established broad and mutually beneficial relations with these countries. It is the imperialist groups that regard Latin America as their hereditary territory that are trying to prevent this from happening, preventing these countries from industrializing and keeping them in a state of raw material supply bases.

The conscience of mankind cannot tolerate the situation in Algeria. Bloody battles are taking place there, and Arab people are being massacred. Although the United Nations is discussing the Algerian issue, the Algerian people's accusations are not being heard. The governments of the imperialist countries are ignoring the terrible tragedy suffered by millions of Algerians. It is time to stop this bloodshed and try to reach an agreement on the Algerian issue based on the interests of the Algerian residents, while also taking into account the interests of France.

Khrushchev then talked about the Soviet Union's relations with Western countries such as France, Britain, and the United States. He said that the Soviet Union has done everything in its power in the past, and will do everything in its power in the future, to seek mutual understanding and establish friendly relations with the people and governments of these countries.

The Soviet Union believes that the main task of the summit conference is to lay a good foundation for easing international tensions, and the time is ripe for preparing and convening a ministerial meeting and a summit conference.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government believe that, under the current conditions, as long as the governments of various countries correctly understand the responsibilities they bear for their own and peace's destiny, they should not be entangled in ideological differences. In handling international affairs and resolving existing disputes, they should start from those factors that do not divide the current world, but from those factors that can bring countries closer together so as to work together to maintain peace.

The only realistic basis for international relations that can be relied upon are the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The principle of peaceful coexistence, which was recently adopted by the United Nations, should truly become the basis for mutual relations between all countries. Unfortunately, countries such as the United States, Britain, and France have not yet expressed their willingness to follow these principles in their relations with other countries. This situation is hindering the easing of tensions and the establishment of trust.

Khrushchev said that the people of all countries are tired of the "Cold War." At the same time, in the current tense and suspicious situation, something could easily happen: a foreign plane "accidentally" appears, "accidentally" dropping a bomb, thereby causing a military conflict that could develop into a full-scale war. And how surprising it is that in the United States and Britain, some officials have repeatedly justified the need for bombers carrying hydrogen bombs to fly in the sky.

Khrushchev said that it now seems to have reached a period where it is difficult to think of a weapon more powerful than hydrogen weapons. Now, millions upon millions of ordinary people around the world have realized the terrible consequences of nuclear weapons for all mankind. They are increasingly resolutely demanding that the governments of all countries, especially the governments of countries that possess nuclear weapons, end the testing of these weapons. Reason suggests to people the only way out of the disarmament stalemate, which is to completely ban nuclear weapons.

Obviously, we will reach a time when, if the government of a country still wants to maintain contact with the people, it cannot turn a deaf ear to this universal demand of the current era; then, even if they cannot reach an agreement with each other, they will have to unilaterally stop the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union is making every effort to eliminate the current international tensions. However, the situation is complicated because the other side is unwilling to see this situation and is trying to preserve and expand its military blocs.

We Communists are realistic politicians. We say that peace must not only be maintained, but also can be maintained. If the people of all countries are deeply aware of how terrible the danger of a new world war is and how great the disaster it will bring to mankind, then they will surely strengthen their struggle for peace and crush the conspiracies of warmongers. We firmly advocate eliminating the "Cold War," we advocate striving to develop trade relations and cultural ties with all countries, and advocate easing international tensions. Simply put, we advocate peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries. It is precisely for these purposes that the Soviet government has suggested to the governments of major countries and the governments of most countries in the world to hold a meeting of the highest-level figures of various countries. Of course, not all issues can be resolved immediately at the summit conference. Its main task is to lay a good foundation for easing international tensions.

Khrushchev said that everyone knows that we also agreed to convene a meeting of foreign ministers and suggested that it be held in April. We believe that the time is ripe to specifically discuss the issues of preparing and convening ministerial meetings and summit conferences.

The main issue now is to ensure European security. If Europe is no longer a military arena and the troops of all countries return to their homes, the threat of war will be eliminated.

Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. State Department's memorandum to the Soviet Union and the U.S. President's reply made no mention of the substance of the Soviet Union's proposals, but raised the issue of Germany and the situation in Eastern European countries. Khrushchev said that we cannot hide our disappointment with the position taken by the U.S. government. The fact that the U.S. President included the so-called situation in Eastern European countries in his letter is already something unheard of in international relations.

It has been repeatedly said in the past that the issue of the socialist system has even been "discussed" with force long ago. After the October Revolution, the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union had "negotiations" on this issue with the interventionists, including the United States. This dispute was resolved at that time with the victory of socialism. Why raise these issues again? We oppose raising such issues, not only oppose, but also declare that once someone wants to change the system of socialist countries from the outside through violence again, we will not stand idly by and will not ignore the suffering of our friends. We are loyal to our obligations and our internationalist responsibilities. We do not want anyone to test our patience again.

When talking about the German issue, Khrushchev said that if one truly wants to do something in this regard from a desire to benefit things, then one should discuss the issue of signing a peace treaty with Germany. If Western countries oppose doing so, we will not insist on including this issue on the agenda. But we do not agree with the practice of some people, like the U.S. State Department's memorandum, of entangling the issue of European security with the German issue.

The main issue now is to ensure European security. Therefore, let us first solve the issues related to the whole of Europe and the world, which will also help solve the German issue. If Europe is no longer a military arena for two blocs and foreign troops return to their homes, then the threat of war can be eliminated, that is to say, European security will be guaranteed, and international tensions will be eased, which will only benefit the people of Europe and countries outside of Europe. Other roads cannot solve the German issue, but will only increase tensions and even lead to war.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries are committed to easing international tensions, strengthening trust between countries, stopping the arms race, banning nuclear weapons, and fundamentally resolving the entire disarmament issue. But Western countries, especially the United States, although they also say in words that they are committed to peace, are actually obstructing the elimination of international tensions and obstructing the establishment of trust between countries. The current situation is that the people of all countries will no longer be deceived by the empty talk of peace by some Western government leaders that cannot be put into concrete action.

The Soviet Union has advocated and now advocates peaceful coexistence, not because it is weak and afraid of threats. The Soviet people hope to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries in the world.

Khrushchev said that on the eve of the Supreme Soviet elections, we, the Communist Party and Soviet state workers who have been placed in the leadership positions of the country by the people, solemnly declare that we will spare no effort to continue to unswervingly work to realize the lofty task of consolidating peace and preventing new wars.

Khrushchev finally said that this election is being held in a situation of surging patriotic enthusiasm and further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. He said that there is no doubt that all voters will unanimously vote for the candidates jointly proposed by the Communist Party and non-Party members, thereby once again demonstrating their unbreakable unity and demonstrating that they are closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

    赫鲁晓夫对选民谈国内建设和国际局势
    苏联要在生活各个领域走在人类的前面
    表示苏联愿同各国和平共处　指责美国阻挠缓和国际局势
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，14日下午在列宁运动场卢日尼基体育宫会见了莫斯科市加里宁选区的选民一万多人，并且发表了演说。
    选民大会开始后，许多选民代表讲了话。他们为苏维埃国家各方面的建设成就感到自豪。他们充分表现了对自己的候选人的一致拥护和全体选民在政治上、道德上的团结一致。选民代表们纷纷表示要在16日投票选举自己爱戴的候选人赫鲁晓夫同志。
    大会进行了三个多小时。各国驻苏联外交使节也出席了大会。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，14日在莫斯科市加里宁选区选民大会上发表演说时谈到了苏联国民经济建设成就、苏联的外交政策和国际局势方面的问题。
    苏联现在已经具备一切条件来胜利地进行共产主义建设
    赫鲁晓夫在演说中回顾了最近四年来苏联国民经济建设的成就。他指出，现在苏联一年内就能够生产出在苏维埃政权开始建立后需要十五年到二十年才能生产出来的工业品。赫鲁晓夫说，这是质的飞跃，它令人信服地说明了我们的国家发生了怎样的变化。现在我们有能力完成任何巨大和复杂的任务。苏联的所有加盟共和国都已经成为先进的、工业发达的社会主义共和国了。任何一个加盟共和国在经济发展程度方面都能够同许多资本主义国家较量。赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联基本建设的规模也在年年扩大。现在，世界上没有任何一个国家的基本建设规模能够同苏联相比。苏联的农业也以飞快的速度发展着，而且将在最近几年内，按人口平均计算，在肉类、油脂和奶类产量方面赶上美国。
    随着经济的发展，苏联人民的物质福利也在不断提高。国民收入年年都有增加。像失业这种对劳动者的可怕灾难在苏联已经一去不返了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，过去的四年标志着苏维埃科学技术的新的辉煌成就和文化的进一步高涨。不久以前，西方世界的某些自命不凡的人物硬说苏联在科学技术方面落后于美国。现在全世界都承认苏联的伟大成就了。但是我们不能由于已有的成就而自满起来，而必须更多地、更顽强地劳动，来解决我们面临的主要的经济任务，使我国在生活的各个领域都走在人类的前面。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，苏联现在已经具备了一切条件来胜利地解决建设共产主义的任务。依靠现有的成就和利用社会主义经济制度的优越性，苏联将进一步迅速增加金属、煤、电力、机器制造业、化学工业和其他部门的生产，以便在今后十五年内在按人口计算的重要产品的生产方面不仅赶上而且超过那些最大的资本主义国家。重要工业部门的生产在今后十五年内大约将扩大为两三倍，农业也将进一步大跃进，这将会大大提高苏联人民的福利，更充分地满足他们的物质和文化需求。
    赫鲁晓夫说，党和政府制定了发展住宅建设的宏伟计划，以便在今后十年到十二年中消灭国内的房荒，这个计划正在实现。单在1957年一年内所建筑的住宅，就比整个第二个五年计划期间所建筑的还多的多。如果1954年全国建造的住宅可以使每一千个居民平均分到七套，那么1957年每一千个居民就可以平均分到十点二套新住宅。这大大超过了资本主义国家的建筑量。据官方材料，按每一千人平均计算，1957年美国建筑了六点七套新住宅，英国建筑了五点九套，法国建筑了六点二套。赫鲁晓夫谈到，任务是要加快住宅建筑速度和保证建筑质量，住宅分配上的缺点必须予以克服，同时必须防止大城市人口由于国内其他地区人口的流入而继续增长。他还批评了有些建筑师强调建筑高楼大厦的错误。他说，在城市建设中，重要的不是房屋的高度，而是要善于合理地设计城市，正确地建设街区，善于利用当地的地势和风景。所有这些都影响到建筑物的造价。必须考虑到这种种条件，确定多少层的住房才在经济上合算。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在最近几年中，苏联的消费品生产大大增加了，人们吃的穿的更好了。但是，在这方面还有一些必须克服的困难。我们的任务就是增加鞋子、纺织品、服装和其他日用品的产量，以便在最近五年到七年内保证苏联人民对这些物品的需求，同时要提高它们的质量。
    苏联人民积极参加政治、经济和文化各方面的生活，而在资本主义国家却是另一种情况。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联所以能够取得所有这些成就，是因为我们生活在社会主义制度下，这里的人民已经成了自己国家的全权主人，并且最积极地参加政治、经济和文化各方面的生活。
    苏联劳动人民非常关心把人民的最优秀的儿女选做代表。因此，我国人民把最高苏维埃选举看做是自己的切身事业。几乎全体选民都去投票。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在资本主义国家里完全是另外一种情况。例如，美国国会最近一次选举只有57.3％达到选举年龄的人投了票，而在1954年那次国会选举中投票的人只有42.5％。在英国下院最近一次选举中，三千四百八十五万二千名选民里只有二千六百七十六万人投了票。这些数字说明，这些国家的选民已经看穿，不管把统治阶级的哪个代表选进国会或议会，这些代表反正都是保护资本家、银行家、大地主和大商人等统治阶级的利益的。例如，在美国现在的五百三十一名国会议员当中有半数以上是律师，四分之一是企业主和银行家。在美国国会里是没有真正的工人和农民的代表的。在占美国人口总数10.4％的黑人当中，只有三个人是国会议员。在美国国会中只选了十七名妇女。
    然而，在苏联，这次苏联最高苏维埃选举中登记的一千三百七十八名联盟院和民族院代表候选人中，有六百一十四人是直接参加生产的工人和集体农庄庄员；就社会地位来讲，有60％以上是工人和农民，其余的是劳动知识分子代表。在代表候选人当中，有26.4％是妇女。这些材料反映了真正的苏维埃民主。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，资本主义的辩护者喜欢把美国描写成一个企业繁荣的国家，描写成资产阶级自由、资产阶级民主的典范。然而，在美国，一小撮百万富翁和亿万富翁从人民的苦难中攫取暴利，千千万万的劳动群众则不得不为了养活自己的儿女和年老的父母而成年累月白费气力地寻找工作。就在这同时，美国政府却支出数以亿计的巨款去建筑军事基地，而对人民的疾苦无动于衷。这就是资本主义繁荣的真面目！这就是所谓资本主义自由！
    社会主义阵营空前强大。苏联用实际行动保卫和平，近年来又交了许多新朋友。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了国际局势方面的一些问题。他说，对苏联的国际环境，我们可以感到满意。在过去四年期间，我们不仅在国外没有失去一个朋友，相反是进一步加强了同他们的友谊，并且又交了许多新朋友。苏联的国际威信不可估量地增长了。它同世界上许多国家的联系扩大和加强了。
    由于苏联人民、一切社会主义国家人民所取得的辉煌胜利，由于这些国家的合作互助，社会主义阵营空前地加强了，世界社会主义体系巩固了并且变成了一支强大的力量。
    帝国主义者不止一次地企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结一致，他们不惜任何代价力图离间社会主义国家，唆使这些国家互相争吵。但是，社会主义国家的各国人民正在回击，今后仍将回击一切反动势力。这些国家的劳动人民很清楚地意识到，只有社会主义各国团结一致，才能保证劳动人民的社会果实和民族独立。
    赫鲁晓夫说，社会主义国家的大家庭并不是排他性的。在过去四年中，苏联加强了同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿拉伯联合共和国以及亚非其他国家的友好联系。苏联和其他爱好和平的国家一道为缓和国际紧张局势、停止军备竞赛和防止新战争而进行了坚持不懈的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，对全人类来讲，现在最迫切的问题是战争与和平的问题。和平、防止新战争可能带来的沉重灾难，是现今人类沿着进步道路前进的决定性条件。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府一直在作种种努力来防止新战争并促进国际关系沿着维护持久和平的道路发展。它们的所做所为都是为了在行动上而不是在口头上争取和平，争取各国人民间的平等关系和友谊。
    赫鲁晓夫回顾了四年来苏联为缓和国际局势所采取的一些最重要的外交措施。他说，所有正直的人们都看到，只有不要战争而要和平、不希望加紧国际局势而希望国际局势正常化的国家，才能采取这些措施。
      苏联的善邻政策已经收到很大效果。苏联密切注意帝国主义在印度尼西亚的阴谋。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联坚持主张毫无例外地同一切国家建立良好的善邻关系，我们准备同有这种愿望的一切国家在对等基础上建立这种关系。
  我们好心好意地对待土耳其，但遗憾的是，目前我们还没有得到它的必要的谅解。可是，尽管土耳其某些政界人士发表了一些不友好的反苏言论，我们同土耳其的关系已经不再是四年以前那样了，我们两国的相互关系中显露出了改善的趋向。我们将不惜一切力量继续执行和平政策，希望土耳其人民和土耳其政府能了解我们善良真诚的意愿。
    苏联同伊朗拖延了数百年的有关边境的争端，现在在相互满意的情况下解决了。现在我们正同伊朗就某些经济问题进行谈判。这些问题的满意解决对发展我们两国的善邻关系将是有益的。我们向伊朗政府声明，苏联过去和现在对伊朗都没有任何不友好的意图。我们认为，伊朗政府会确信这一点的。
    苏联同阿富汗的关系最近几年来比以前更好和更巩固了。
    近年来，我国同印度尼西亚共和国建立了友好关系。苏联人民不能不注意帝国主义者在印度尼西亚的阴谋。为什么他们企图干涉这个国家的内政和在那里制造阴谋呢？不能允许这样做。印度尼西亚人民要根据自己的意愿建立自己的生活，任何人也无权强制印度尼西亚人民接受自己的意旨和不称他们心意的制度。
    由于不是苏联所能为力的原因，苏联同巴基斯坦和亚洲其他某些国家的关系没有得到改善，因为这些国家被帝国主义者拉进了巴格达条约和东南亚条约组织，对这一点，不能不表示遗憾。
    苏联同芬兰和其他斯堪的纳维亚国家的良好善邻关系正在发展。我们重视希望不参加军事集团的瑞典的中立。苏联尊重以基哈德森为首的挪威政府和以汉森为首的丹麦政府所采取的外交政策步骤，它们反对在本国领土上设置发射原子武器和火箭武器的装置。
    我国同中立的奥地利的关系在缔结国家条约后正常化了，并正在本着善邻精神发展。
    我们有着改善同意大利和希腊关系的巨大可能性。当然，我们不能不考虑到，这两个国家的有影响的人士不是更多地听取本国人民的呼声，而是更多地附和北大西洋公约组织将军们的论调，同时，根据报纸的消息，他们已经在本国着手准备建立美国火箭基地了。但是，我们相信意大利人和希腊人的理智。
    在苏联同拉丁美洲国家的关系方面，出现了某些已经好转的显著标志。苏联同这些国家到现在为止还没有建立广泛和互利的关系，对于这一点我们是没有责任的。是那些把拉丁美洲当作自己的世袭领地的帝国主义集团在竭力阻碍这样做，在阻碍这些国家的工业化，使它们保持着原料供应地的状态。
    人类的良心不能容忍阿尔及利亚的局势。那里正在进行着血腥的战斗，阿拉伯人民遭到屠杀。虽然联合国在讨论阿尔及利亚问题，但是，阿尔及利亚人民的控诉没有受到理睬。帝国主义国家政府无视几百万阿尔及利亚人所经受的可怕的悲剧。是停止这场流血和设法在根据阿尔及利亚居民的利益、同时也考虑到法国利益的情况下就阿尔及利亚问题达成协议的时候了。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到苏联同法国、英国、美国这样一些西方国家的关系。他说，苏联过去已经尽了一切力量、而且将来也将尽一切力量来谋求同这些国家的人民和政府互相了解并建立友好关系。
    苏联认为，高级会议主要任务是给缓和国际紧张局势打下良好基础，筹备和召开部长级会议和高级会议时机已经成熟。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府认为，在目前的条件下，各国政府只要正确地领会到自己和和平的命运所负的责任，都应该不纠缠在意识形态的分歧中。在处理国际事务方面、在解决现存的争端时，他们应该从那些不是使现今世界分裂的因素出发，而是从那些能使各国互相接近以便为维护和平而共同努力的因素出发。
    可以作为国际关系的唯一现实基础的是著名的五项原则。不久前联合国所通过的和平共处原则应该真正成为一切国家相互关系的基础。遗憾的是，像美、英、法这样一些国家，目前还没有表示愿意在对其他国家的关系上遵循这些原则。而这种情况正在妨碍缓和局势和建立信任。
    赫鲁晓夫说，各国人民对于“冷战”已经感到厌倦。同时，在目前局势紧张、疑虑重重的情况下，随便就可能发生这样的事情：外国飞机“偶然”出现，“偶然”扔下一颗炸弹，从而引起军事冲突并可能发展成为全面战争。而在美国和英国，有些官方人士竟一再证明有必要让载着氢弹的轰炸机在上空飞行，这使人多么惊奇。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在看来已经到了这样一个时期：很难再想出比氢武器更厉害的武器了。现在全世界千千万万普通人都已经认识到核武器对全人类的可怕后果。他们越来越坚决地要求各国政府、首先是拥有核武器的国家的政府结束这种武器的试验。理智为人们提示出摆脱裁军僵局的唯一出路，这就是完全禁止核武器。
    显然，我们将到达这样一个时期，那时，一个国家的政府如果还愿意同人民保持联系，它就不能对现时代这种普遍要求置若罔闻；那时，即使彼此间不能达成协议，它们也不得不单方面地停止生产原子武器和氢武器。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联在尽一切努力消除目前国际紧张局势。但是，由于另一方不愿意看到这种局面而力图保存和扩大自己的军事集团，情况复杂起来了。
    我们共产党人是现实的政治家。我们说，和平不仅必须加以维护，而且也是有可能维护住的。如果各国人民深深地意识到，新的世界大战是多么可怕的危险，它将给人类带来多大的灾难，那么他们就一定会加强自己争取和平的斗争和粉碎战争挑拨者的阴谋。我们坚决主张消除“冷战”，我们主张竭力发展同所有国家的贸易关系和文化联系，主张缓和国际紧张局势。简单地说，我们主张和平共处，主张各国之间和平竞赛。正是为了这些目的，苏联政府才向各大国政府以及世界大多数国家的政府建议举行各国最高级人士的会晤。当然，不是所有的问题在高级会议上都可以立刻解决。它的主要任务是给缓和国际紧张局势打下良好的基础。
    赫鲁晓夫说，大家知道，我们也同意召开外交部长会议，并且建议在4月份举行。我们认为，具体地讨论关于筹备和召开部长级会议和高级会议的问题，时机已经成熟。
    现在主要问题是保障欧洲安全。如果欧洲不再成为军事竞技场，各国军队各回老家，战争威胁就会消除。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国国务院给苏联的备忘录以及美国总统的复信都对苏联建议的实质只字不提，但是却提出了德国问题和关于东欧国家的局势问题。赫鲁晓夫说，我们无法掩饰我们对美国政府所采取的立场的失望。美国总统把所谓东欧国家局势问题列入信中这一事实本身，就已经是国际关系中前所未闻的事情。
    过去已经一再讲过，社会主义制度问题甚至早已遭到过武力的“讨论”了。苏联各族人民在十月革命后曾经在这个问题上同包括美国在内的干涉者进行过“谈判”。这个争论当时就以社会主义的胜利而告解决了。为什么还要再次提出这些问题呢？我们反对提出这类问题，不仅仅反对，并且宣布，一旦有人重新想从外面通过暴力来改变社会主义国家的制度，我们将不会袖手旁观，不会置我们朋友的苦难于不顾。我们矢忠于自己的义务和自己的国际主义职责。我们不希望有什么人再来考验我们的耐性。
    在谈到德国问题时，赫鲁晓夫说，如果真正从对事情有利的愿望出发而想在这方面做一点什么的话，那就应该讨论签订对德和约的问题。如果西方国家反对这样做，我们也不坚持把这个问题列入议程。但是我们不同意有些人、像美国国务院的备忘录那样，把欧洲安全问题同德国问题纠缠在一起的做法。
    现在主要的问题是保障欧洲安全。因此，让我们还是先来解决关系到全欧和全世界的问题，这样也就有助于解决德国问题。如果欧洲不再成为两个集团的军事竞技场，外国军队各回老家，那末战争威胁就能消除，也就是说，欧洲安全将能够有所保障，国际局势就会缓和下来，这对欧洲以及欧洲以外的各国人民只会有好处。别的道路不能解决德国问题，反而只会使局势紧张起来，甚至导向战争。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联、中华人民共和国和一切社会主义国家都致力于缓和国际紧张局势、加强各国间的信任、停止军备竞赛、禁止核武器和根本解决整个裁军问题。但是西方国家，首先是美国，虽然它们口头上也说致力于和平，而实际上却阻挠消除国际紧张局势，阻挠建立各国间的信任。现在的情况是，各国人民已经不会被西方某些政府领导人的那种不能付诸具体行动的和平空谈所欺骗了。
    苏联过去主张过、而现在也主张和平共处，这并不是因为它软弱和害怕威胁。苏联人民希望同世界各国人民和平友好相处。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在最高苏维埃选举的前夕，我们这些被人民安置在国家领导岗位上的共产党和苏维埃国家的工作人员郑重表示，我们要不吝惜自己的力量，继续坚持不渝地为实现巩固和平和防止新战争的崇高任务而努力。
    赫鲁晓夫最后谈到，这次选举是在爱国热情蓬勃高涨和工农联盟进一步巩固的情况下举行的。他说，毫无疑问，全体选民将一致投票选举共产党和非党人士联合提出的候选人，从而再一次表明他们牢不可破的团结，表明他们紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围。
