The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's directive on launching the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement is a great bugle call for a nationwide mass mobilization. It will mobilize the people of the whole country to further develop revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity on all fronts, eliminate backward phenomena, get rid of bureaucracy, inertia, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, and push the socialist construction upsurge that has already emerged across the country—comparing progress, comparing quantity, speed, quality, and economy—to a new level.

The struggle against waste and conservatism is the logical continuation of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle since May of last year. Hundreds of millions of people have not only broken through the capitalist net in terms of ownership but have also undergone thorough revolutionary liberation in ideology and politics, in the depths of their souls, creating a new and lively political situation. Thus, they cannot but demand to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and they cannot but demand to accelerate the transformation of our country's face. The broad masses of awakened people cannot tolerate the obstacles of bureaucracy, inertia, extravagance, arrogance, squeamishness, etc., that hinder their advance towards a new life in the future, cannot tolerate wasteful and conservative phenomena, and cannot but launch a sharp struggle against these things. This mass movement, as stated in the "Directive of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Launching the Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism Movement," has become a "socialist great leap forward in production and a cultural great leap forward," and a "decisive movement in the nationwide rectification movement to improve the work of the entire country and promote the great drive of the whole people."

Since liberation, many new staff members have brought the bad habits of the old society into the revolutionary ranks; and some old staff members have also developed a rather strong sense of bureaucracy and inertia. For a time, the bad habit of vying for rank, vying for treatment, comparing enjoyment, not leaving the office, not going down to the grassroots, and not approaching the masses had developed to some extent. Now, the raging fire of the mass movement has quickly burned away this evil trend. What has replaced it is that many staff members are carrying forward the revolutionary spirit, going deep into the working masses, developing the working method of "cultivating experimental plots," diligently studying their professions and technology, and taking the lead in doing the most arduous, difficult, and complicated work. Large numbers of staff members and intellectuals are leaving the cities, going to the countryside and mountains, to participate in physical labor to build a socialist countryside together with the peasants. In the education, science, and art circles, many people have put forward personal plans and collective plans, demanding to become working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert as soon as possible. The democratic parties and the industrial and commercial circles are also working hard to accelerate their socialist transformation. All kinds of work are advancing by leaps and bounds, and there are new victories every day. The backward are striving to catch up with and surpass the advanced, and the advanced are striving to become even more advanced. This has formed a truly revolutionary upsurge situation of unity of purpose and carrying out socialist competition.

A large number of facts prove that building socialism on our poor and blank land, turning our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced and strong country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and catching up with the most developed capitalist countries in a relatively short historical period, is not only not hopeless as the Rightists say, but is very promising, and we are confident that it can be achieved much earlier. All pessimists and doubters who cannot see the great power of the liberated people can take a rest.

In order to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and in order to enable the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement to achieve the greatest results, all leading cadres must throw themselves into the practical struggle of the broad masses, go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, advance together with the masses, and concentrate the revolutionary drive and creative wisdom of the masses. Only in this way can they avoid falling behind the masses, thoroughly correct the tendency of "seeing things but not people" that exists among many people, and play an active role in promoting and guiding the mass movement like thousands of horses galloping.

The directive of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party tells us: As long as we grasp the key point of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, lead it well, arrange it well, and mobilize the masses well, we can completely grasp the rectification movement and production work at the current stage in a unified way. This is an important leadership method. Rectification is to eliminate bureaucracy, inertia, extravagance, arrogance, squeamishness, and all other bad styles of work that are divorced from reality and the masses, so that cadres and the masses can truly become one and strive for great improvements in production and the work of the entire country, and strive to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. To achieve this goal, we must mobilize the broad masses to criticize and expose all the above-mentioned bad ideological styles of work. The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement consciously guides and concentrates the masses' opinions on the work style of cadres to the criticism of the two bad tendencies of conservatism and waste that directly violate the "greater, faster, better, and more economical" policy. On the one hand, it can most effectively implement the "greater, faster, better, and more economical" policy, and on the other hand, it can solve many problems by focusing on the exposure and criticism in this regard. We cannot restrict the scope of mass exposure and criticism, but we cannot fail to organize and lead the exposure and criticism and let it run its own course. That way, we will do everything, but we will not be able to penetrate anything, and in the end, we will not be able to solve the main problems.

The directive of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party tells us: In the course of the movement, various advanced speeds and advanced indicators that are difficult to achieve on weekdays will continue to emerge, constantly breaking through the original balance, and breaking certain old rules and regulations that are not conducive to the development of productive forces. At this time, the responsibility of the leadership is, on the one hand, to promote the backward parts to catch up, and on the other hand, to consider reviewing and revising the original plans and old rules and regulations. This situation has already appeared in large numbers and will continue to appear in large numbers in the future.

The broad masses of workers and staff demand to revise or abolish certain unreasonable rules and regulations. This is the result of the further development of our country's liberated social productive forces in the nationwide rectification movement. In the past few years, the rules and regulations formulated by various departments of the government, various localities, and various enterprises have played a promoting role in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Now, many rules and regulations are still applicable. However, due to the continuous development of productive forces and the changes in objective conditions, some rules and regulations are no longer applicable. They have become obstacles to further improving the enthusiasm of the masses and developing production. Now, it is legitimate for the masses of workers and staff to demand to revise or abolish them.

Rules and regulations are part of the superstructure. The superstructure must serve the economic base and must adapt to the needs of the development of productive forces. Generally speaking, our socialist superstructure is adapted to the economic base and meets the needs of the development of productive forces. However, due to the continuous development of productive forces, individual links of the socialist superstructure and the economic base will inevitably have this or that contradiction. We must pay close attention to adjusting these contradictions in a timely manner. The "Directive of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on Launching the Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism Movement" pointed out: "Some original rules and regulations that are not conducive to the development of productive forces will continue to be broken by the creations of the masses in the movement. We must humbly study the creations of the masses, and re-examine the original rules and regulations in accordance with the needs of development and the tests of the masses in practice. Anything that truly binds the development of productive forces and can be quickly revised should be revised immediately." This is fully in line with the principled provisions of materialist dialectics.

However, to revise or abolish certain unreasonable rules and regulations, it must be carried out on the basis of the masses' consciousness and willingness. Comrade Mao Zedong had already warned us in his article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership": "Wherever there are masses, there are roughly three parts of people: the more active, the intermediate, and the more backward." For all questions, these three parts of people will have different views and will hold different attitudes. A few advanced elements have actively risen up and demanded to replace the old rules and regulations with new ones. A few backward people do not yet have this awareness, are unwilling to implement reforms, and even cling to the old rules and regulations. The vast majority of the rest are often between these two types of people. This or that difference of opinion among the masses is a matter of ideological issues within the people. For such problems, democratic methods must be used to solve them, that is, the method of discussion, the method of criticism, and the method of persuasion and education. If we leave the arduous and meticulous mass ideological and political work and attempt to use simple administrative orders to "help seedlings grow by pulling them up," forcing them to keep up with the advanced elements regardless of the masses' awareness conditions, there is a danger of being divorced from the masses and turning good things into bad things.

Similarly, the formulation and revision of old production quotas and other various indicators must be carried out after in-depth discussions and agreement by the masses before they can be implemented. Many people are reluctant to abandon the old production quotas. In the final analysis, there are only two reasons: one is that some people have not realized how much loss the old quotas have caused to the country and enterprises, and they still lack a global perspective; the other is that some people are afraid of affecting their personal income, which is the result of individualism at work. Therefore, the leaders of each unit must conduct in-depth political and ideological work, conduct communist ideological education for the masses, and criticize departmentalism and individualism. In carrying out these tasks, the method is still to rely on the advanced masses, carry out great democracy, and conduct great debates. Through presenting facts, reasoning, and conducting criticism and self-criticism, we can raise awareness and make people convinced. We must not only improve the ideological awareness of the intermediate masses but also improve the awareness of the backward masses. When the awareness of the intermediate masses and the backward masses is improved and they are mobilized, it means that the Party's ideological and political work has been done well, and things will be easier to handle.

Now the bugle call for a nationwide mass mobilization has sounded. Let us, as a whole country, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, promote the anti-waste, anti-conservatism, comparing progress, comparing greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the upsurge of socialist construction, and strive to build socialism in our country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

### 全民大动员的号角响了

    全民大动员的号角响了
    中共中央关于开展反浪费、反保守运动的指示，是全民大动员的伟大号角。它将动员全国人民在各个战线上进一步发挥革命的积极性和创造性，扫除落后现象，打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，把现在已经在全国出现的比先进、比多快好省的社会主义建设的高潮推上一个新的水平。
    反浪费反保守的斗争是去年5月以来的整风运动和反右派斗争的逻辑的继续。几亿人民不但在所有制方面冲决了资本主义的罗网，而且在思想政治方面，在灵魂的深处同样得到了彻底的革命性的解放，出现了新的生动活泼的政治局面，这样，他们不能不要求多快好省地建设社会主义，不能不要求加速改变我们国家的面貌。广大的觉悟了的群众，不能容忍妨碍他们向未来的新生活猛进的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气等等障碍物，不能容忍浪费现象和保守现象，不能不向这些东西展开尖锐的斗争。这一群众性的运动，正如“中共中央关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示”中所说的，已经成为“社会主义的生产大跃进和文化大跃进的运动”，成为“在全民整风运动中改进整个国家工作和促进全民大干劲的一个带有决定性的运动”。
    解放以来，新的工作人员中有不少人把旧社会的不良作风带进了革命阵营；而一些老的工作人员也滋长了相当浓重的官气和暮气。有一个时期，争等级、争待遇、比享受、不出办公室、不下基层、不接近群众的恶劣风气曾经有所发展。现在，群众运动的烈火迅速地烧掉了这股歪风。代之而起的，是许多工作人员发扬革命精神，深入劳动群众，发展“种试验田”的工作方法，刻苦钻研业务和技术，而且带头去干最辛苦、最困难、最繁杂的工作。大批的工作人员和知识分子离开城市，下乡上山，去同农民一起参加建设社会主义农村的体力劳动。在教育界、科学界、文艺界，很多人提出了个人规划和集体规划，要求尽快地成为工人阶级的又红又专的知识分子。民主党派和工商界也同样在努力加速自己的社会主义改造。种种工作都在突飞猛进，每天都有新的胜利。落后的努力要赶上和赶过先进的，先进的努力争取更加先进。这就形成了万众一心、开展社会主义竞赛的真正革命高潮形势。
    大量的事实证明，在我们这块既穷且白的国土上建成社会主义，把我国由落后的农业国变为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的先进的强国，在比较短的历史时期内赶上最发展的资本主义国家，不但不像右派先生们所说的那样没有希望，而且是大有希望，而且有把握可以大大提前实现。一切看不见解放了的人民的伟大力量的悲观论者，怀疑论者，可以休矣。
    为了多快好省地建设社会主义，为了使反浪费反保守的运动能够取得最大的成果，一切领导干部必须投身到广大群众的实践斗争中去，深入实际，深入群众，与群众一齐前进，集中群众的革命干劲和创造智慧。只有这样，他们才能够不至于落在群众的后面，并且彻底纠正在许多人中间存在的“见物不见人”的偏向，才能够在万马奔腾般的群众运动中起促进和指导的积极作用。
    中共中央的指示告诉我们：只要抓紧反浪费反保守运动这个纲，领导得好，安排得好，群众发动得好，就完全可以把现阶段的整风运动和生产等工作统一地抓起来。这是一个重要的领导方法。整风是要扫除官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气和其他一切脱离实际、脱离群众的不良作风，使干部和群众真正打成一片，争取生产和整个国家工作的大改进，争取更加多快好省地建设社会主义。要达到这一目的，就必须发动广大群众起来批评和揭发上述一切不良的思想作风。反浪费反保守的运动，把群众对于干部作风的意见，有意识地引导和集中到批判保守和浪费这两个直接违反“多快好省”方针的不良倾向上来，一方面可以最有效地贯彻“多快好省”的方针，一方面也可以围绕这方面的揭发批判解决多方面的问题。我们不能限制群众揭发批判的范围，但也不能对揭发批判不加组织领导，任其自流。那样就会什么也搞，什么也搞不透，到头还是解决不了主要问题。
    中共中央的指示告诉我们：在运动过程中会不断出现各种平日难以达到的先进速度和先进指标，不断地突破原有的平衡，并且打破某些不利于生产力发展的旧的规章制度。这时候，领导的责任一方面是促进落后的部分赶上去，一方面就要考虑审改原来的规划和旧的规章制度。这种情形现在已经大量出现了，将来还要继续大量出现。
    广大的职工群众要求修改或者废除某些不合理的规章制度。这是我国已经解放了的社会生产力在全民性的整风运动中得到了进一步发展的结果。过去几年来，政府各部门、各地方、各企业制定的规章制度，绝大部分对于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业都起了促进的作用。现在，很多规章制度还是适用的。但是，由于生产力的不断发展，由于客观条件的变化，有一部分规章制度就显得不适用了。它们成了进一步提高群众积极性和发展生产的障碍。现在职工群众要求加以修改或废除，这是正当的。
    规章制度是上层建筑的一部分。上层建筑一定要为经济基础服务，一定要适应生产力发展的需要。我们社会主义的上层建筑，从总的方面来说，是同经济基础相适应的，是合乎生产力发展的需要的。但是，由于生产力的不断发展，社会主义的上层建筑的个别环节和经济基础之间仍然不可避免地会发生这样或那样的矛盾。我们必须十分注意及时地调整这些矛盾。“中共中央关于开展反浪费、反保守运动的指示”中指出：“原来一些不利于生产力发展的规章制度，会在运动中不断地为群众的创举所打破。我们必须对于群众的创造，虚心地加以研究，按照发展的需要和群众在实践中的考验，重新审订原来的规章制度。凡是真正束缚生产力发展而又可以迅速修改的，应该立即修改。”这完全符合于唯物辩证法的原则性的规定。
    但是，要修改或废除某些不合理的规章制度，必须在群众自觉自愿的基础上进行。毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”一文中早已告诫我们：“任何有群众的地方，大致都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人。”对于一切问题，这三部分人都会有不同的看法，都会抱着不同的态度。少数先进分子已经积极地起来，要求用新的规章制度来代替旧的规章制度。少数落后的人却还没有这种觉悟，还不愿意实行改革，甚至还抓住旧的规章制度不放。其余大多数人往往处于这两种人之间。群众中的这种或那种意见的不同，是人民内部的思想问题。对于这种问题，必须用民主的方法解决，就是说，用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决。如果离开艰苦的细致的群众思想政治工作，而企图用简单的行政命令方法“揠苗助长”，不顾群众的觉悟条件而强迫他们向先进分子看齐，这就有脱离群众、把好事办成坏事的危险。
    同样，对于旧的生产定额和其他各种指标的制订和修改，也必须经过群众深入的讨论和同意，然后才能实行。许多人舍不得抛掉旧的生产定额，归根到底，不外两种原因，一种是有些人没有认识到旧定额对国家、对企业造成多大损失，他们还缺乏全局的观点；另一种是有些人怕影响个人的收入，这是个人主义思想在作怪。因此，各单位的领导人员要深入进行政治思想工作，向群众进行共产主义思想教育，批判本位主义和个人主义思想。在进行这些工作的时候，方法仍然是要依靠先进群众，开展大鸣大放和大争大辩，通过摆事实，讲道理，进行批评和自我批评，从而提高觉悟，使人心悦诚服。我们不仅要提高中间状态的群众的思想觉悟，还要提高落后群众的觉悟。中间群众和落后群众的觉悟提高了，发动起来了，这就表示党的思想政治工作做好了，事情也就好办了。
    现在全民大动员的号角响了，让我们举国一致地在各级党组织的领导下，推进反浪费、反保守、比先进、比多快好省的社会主义建设高潮，争取更多更快更好更省地在我国建成社会主义。
