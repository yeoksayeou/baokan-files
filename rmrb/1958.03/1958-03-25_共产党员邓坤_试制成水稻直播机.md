Xinhua News Agency News: Deng Kun, a member of the Communist Party of China Longyan County Committee in Fujian Province, and the Party Secretary of Jianxiao Township, recently successfully trial-manufactured a rice direct seeding machine. This direct seeding machine has a wooden wheel at each end, and an octagonal seeding box made of sheet metal in the middle. The bottom of the box has forty holes. During direct seeding, as long as the wooden wheels are pushed forward in the field, the seeds are evenly sown into the field from the holes. Each rotation of the wooden wheels can directly sow five rows, with eight plants per row, and a plant and row spacing of seven inches, increasing efficiency tenfold compared to manual direct seeding.

Deng Kun was originally a carpenter and has been a Party member for twenty-two years. After being sent to his hometown of Jianxiao Township last year to serve as the Party Secretary, he actively worked with local farmers to research and trial-manufacture new agricultural tools.

    试制成水稻直播机
    新华社讯　中共福建省龙岩县委会委员、柬萧乡党委书记邓坤，最近试制水稻直播机成功。这部直播机两端各装一个木轮、中间是铁皮制成的八角形播种箱、箱底有四十个孔门。直播时，只要在田里推动木轮前进，种子便从孔门中均匀地播到田里。木轮每转动一圈，能直播五行，每行八株，株行距七寸，比用人工直播效率提高十倍。
    邓坤是木匠出身，入党已有二十二年。他在去年下放到家乡——柬萧乡担任党委书记后，就积极同当地农民一起研究试制新农具。
