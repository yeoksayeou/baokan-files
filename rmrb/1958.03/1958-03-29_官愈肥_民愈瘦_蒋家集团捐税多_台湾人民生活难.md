Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 28th dispatch: It is reported that currently, for every 100 yuan of income earned by Taiwanese residents, 53 yuan are plundered by the Chiang Kai-shek clique through more than one hundred kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies.

Chen Hanping, the Finance Director of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Taiwan Provincial Government, revealed in a recent conversation with Taiwanese newspaper reporters that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's tax revenue for 1958 is estimated to be 7.3 billion Taiwan dollars (40 Taiwan dollars are worth one US dollar). Based on Taiwan's population of 9.4 million, the average tax burden per person per year is 780 Taiwan dollars. This amount accounts for 53% of the average income of Taiwanese residents.

According to statistics released by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the average income per person in Taiwan last year was 1,465 Taiwan dollars. After deducting the 780 Taiwan dollars in taxes, the actual income is only 685 Taiwan dollars, equivalent to 17 US dollars. This amount cannot maintain a person's minimum standard of living for a year in Taiwan, where prices are high.

The Chiang Kai-shek clique places the vast majority of the tax burden on the working people and small and medium-sized merchants of Taiwan. To date, there are already more than one million cases of residents in Taiwan who are in arrears with taxes and resisting taxes due to the unbearable burden of exorbitant levies. Tragedies of shops being sealed and auctioned due to tax arrears and farmers having people seized and houses sealed due to tax arrears occur daily throughout Taiwan. (Attached picture)

    蒋家集团捐税多　台湾人民生活难
    新华社28日讯　台北消息：目前台湾居民每收入一百元，其中有五十三元被蒋介石集团用一百多种名目的苛捐重税搜刮了去。
    蒋介石集团台湾省财政厅长陈汉平最近对台湾报纸记者发表谈话透露，1958年度蒋介石集团的捐税收入约为七十三亿元台币（四十元台币值一美元）。以台湾九百四十万人口计算，平均每人每年负担七百八十元台币的捐税。这数目占台湾居民平均收入的53％。
    据蒋介石集团发表的统计，台湾居民去年平均每人收入一千四百六十五元台币。扣去七百八十元的捐税，实际收入只有六百八十五元台币，相当于十七美元。这数目在物价昂贵的台湾，不能维持一个人一年的最低生活水平。
    蒋介石集团把捐税负担绝大部分压在台湾劳动人民和中小商人的身上。到目前为止，台湾已经有一百多万件居民因不堪苛重负担而欠税和抗税的新旧案件。商店因欠税被查封拍卖和农民因欠税被拉人封屋的惨剧，在台湾各地每天都有发生。（附图片）
