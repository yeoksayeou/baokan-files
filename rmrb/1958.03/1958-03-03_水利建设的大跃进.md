    The Great Leap Forward in Water Conservancy Construction

    In the two years since cooperativization, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Gansu Province, with a heroic spirit that moves mountains and rivers, have overcome countless hardships and created astonishing miracles in water conservancy construction. Now, the proportion of irrigated land in the province to the total cultivated land has increased from less than 10% at the time of liberation to 30%. The province has changed from a grain-deficient province to a grain-surplus province since 1956. In 1952, the province's grain output averaged 507 jin per capita (urban and rural), and in 1957 it had increased to 735 jin. Since last winter, Gansu Province's water conservancy construction has seen its second peak since 1956. Recently, according to the new situation of rapid development in water conservancy construction, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has increased the 1958 plan to expand the irrigated area by 2.93 million mu to 10 million mu. From October last year to February 20 this year, in five months, the province has expanded the irrigated area by more than 5.3 million mu, more than double the area expanded in 1956, and more than five times the area expanded in 1957. As long as this leap-forward speed is maintained, and with three or four more years of hard work, this province, which used to be the most severely drought-stricken, may completely overcome drought.

    The leaping development of water conservancy construction in Gansu Province is worthy of celebration by the people of the whole country. Gansu is located on the Northwest Plateau, where there are barren mountains and ridges everywhere, and soil erosion is very serious. 80% of the province's cultivated land is on mountains and hills, with very little rainfall and a lack of water sources. "Nine out of ten years are drought years," and the population is very sparse. Seeing the natural conditions and the facts of the leap forward in Gansu Province, people cannot help but think: If this province with very poor conditions can do it, why can't provinces and regions with better conditions do it even faster?

    The water conservancy construction in Gansu Province is an arduous struggle between man and nature. Faced with a harsh and disaster-ridden nature, they did not complain, blame others, or be pessimistic and disappointed, but mobilized the masses to seize water and grain from nature. In this regard, Gansu Province has a valuable experience, that is: "To revolutionize nature, we must first carry out a revolution in people's thinking." Should we bow our heads and submit to nature, or should we actively forge ahead? Should we strive to be the masters of nature, or should we willingly be slaves of nature? -- This is a sharp ideological struggle. If we do not first use revolutionary thought to defeat right-leaning conservative thought, it will be impossible to conquer nature. Therefore, the Party's leading organs in Gansu Province actively led and carried out this ideological struggle, thoroughly criticizing the "Gansu is backward" theory, as well as right-leaning conservative ideas such as "water conservancy has reached its peak" and "small-scale water conservancy cannot solve major problems." This enabled the vast number of cadres and masses to establish the idea that "man will conquer nature" and encouraged the revolutionary courage to fight against nature, resulting in a great victory in this struggle.

    The struggle to transform nature, like class struggle, cannot be won without the active participation of the broadest masses of the people. Once the masses are truly mobilized, they will create one miracle after another. Because there are many mountains in Gansu Province, the masses can divert water to high mountains 2,000 meters above sea level; because water sources are insufficient, the masses can build long canals hundreds or even thousands of kilometers long across mountains and valleys; because there is a lack of funds and materials, the masses invest themselves and find their own building materials; because there is a shortage of water lifting tools, the masses create all kinds of waterwheels... The more difficulties there are, the more ways the masses think of to overcome them. This experience once again vividly proves a truth: To be a promoter of the revolution, we must believe in the wisdom and strength of the broad masses, do everything possible to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, conscientiously summarize and promote the advanced experience of the masses, and lead the masses to advance bravely.

    Conservatives treat the masses in a different way. They always like to imagine what limits there are to the path of the masses' progress, thinking that the masses can never cross them. The masses have only just expanded the irrigated area by several million mu, and they will shout: "Water conservancy has reached its peak!" When they hear that a few people among the masses have conservative and backward ideas, they think they have found a "reason" for "everything must be done slowly." Seeing a little failure and error in the movement, they will pour cold water on the masses and deny the great achievements established by the vast number of people through hard work. The experience of Gansu and other regions tells us: Only by infinitely believing in the masses, rather than "believing" in the masses to a limited extent, can there be a true mass line, can we lead the masses to continuously advance, and not be abandoned by the masses.

    Natural conditions are very complex, and the rainfall, water sources, terrain, etc. in each region are different, so there are also different requirements for water conservancy work. The leading organs at all levels in Gansu Province have been able to gradually grasp the characteristics and changing laws of local natural conditions through investigation and research and summarizing the experiences of the masses, and on this basis, they have determined a variety of practices suitable for different regions. In this regard, there are many specific experiences that are also worth learning from in various places.

    Water conservancy construction in Gansu Province is advancing victoriously like in many other provinces. We look forward to new victories in Gansu Province.

### 水利建设的大跃进

    水利建设的大跃进
    在合作化后两年多的时间里，甘肃省人民在共产党的领导下，以气吞山河的英雄气概，冲破无数艰难困苦，在水利建设事业上创造了惊人的奇迹。现在这个省的灌溉面积占总耕地面积的比例，已由解放时的不足10％提高到30％。全省从1956年起就已由缺粮省变为余粮省，1952年全省粮食产量按城乡人口平均每人有五百零七斤，1957年已增加到七百三十五斤。去冬以来，甘肃省的水利建设又出现了1956年以来的第二次高峰。最近，中共甘肃省委根据水利建设突飞猛进的新形势，已将1958年度扩大灌溉面积二百九十三万亩的计划增加到一千万亩。从去年10月到今年2月20日，五个月中全省已扩大灌溉面积五百三十多万亩，等于1956年度扩大灌溉面积的一倍多，相当于1957年度扩大灌溉面积的五倍多。只要坚持这样的跃进速度，再苦战三、四年，这个过去旱灾最严重的省份，就可能完全战胜干旱。
    甘肃省水利建设的飞跃发展，值得全国人民为之欢欣鼓舞。甘肃地处西北高原，到处是童山秃岭，水土流失十分严重，全省80％的耕地都在山上和丘陵上，降雨量极少，水源缺乏，“十年九旱”，人口很稀。看到了甘肃省的自然条件和跃进的事实，人们不能不想到：这个条件非常坏的省份能够做到的事，比它条件更好的省、区为什么不可以更快地做到呢？
    甘肃省的水利建设，是人同自然的一场艰苦卓绝的斗争。面对着险恶多灾的大自然，他们没有怨天尤人，悲观失望，而是发动群众向大自然夺取水，夺取粮食。在这方面，甘肃省有一条宝贵的经验，就是：“欲革大自然的命，首先要在人们思想上进行一次革命”。在大自然面前是低头屈服呢，还是积极进取呢？是力争做自然界的主人呢，还是甘做自然界的奴隶？——这是一场尖锐的思想斗争。如果不首先用革命思想战胜右倾保守思想，要战胜自然是不可能的。因此，甘肃省党的领导机关就积极领导开展这种思想斗争，彻底地批判了“甘肃落后论”以及“水利发展到顶了”、“小型水利解决不了大问题”等等右倾保守思想，这样，就使广大干部和群众树立起“人定胜天”的思想，鼓起了向自然做斗争的革命勇气，结果就在这场斗争中赢得了巨大的胜利。
    改造自然的斗争同阶级斗争一样，没有最广大的人民群众积极参加，是不可能取胜的。而一当广大群众真正动起来，就会创造一个接着一个的奇迹。甘肃省山多，群众就能把水引上拔海两千公尺的高山；水源不足，群众就能跨山越沟修成几百公里以至一千公里的长渠；资金和材料缺乏，群众就自己投资，自己找建筑材料；提水工具不足，群众就自己创造各式各样的水车……。困难多，群众想出的克服困难的办法更多。这个经验，再一次生动地证明了一条真理：要做革命的促进派，就必须相信广大群众的智慧和力量，尽一切努力去发挥群众的积极性和创造性，认真总结和推广群众中的先进经验，领导群众奋勇前进。
    保守主义者对待群众却是另一种态度。他们总是好为群众前进的道路设想出什么极限，以为群众永远不可能逾越它。群众还只是刚刚扩大了几百万亩灌溉面积，他们就会喊：“水利发展到顶了！”听到群众中少数人有保守落后思想，他们就以为这下子可找到了“一切要慢慢来”的“理由”。看到运动中发生一点小小的失败和错误，他们就会给群众泼冷水，否定广大群众经过辛勤劳动而建立的伟大功绩。甘肃的经验和其他地区的经验告诉我们：领导者只有无限地相信群众，而不是有限度地“相信”群众，才会有真正的群众路线，才能领导群众不断地前进，而不被群众所抛弃。
    自然条件十分复杂，各个地区的雨量、水源、地形等等都各不相同，因此在水利工作上也有不同的要求。甘肃省各级领导机关能够通过调查研究、总结群众经验，逐步掌握当地自然条件的特点和变化规律，在这个基础上确定了适于不同地区的多种多样的做法。在这方面有许多具体经验也值得各地借鉴。
    甘肃省的水利建设正在同其他许多省份一样胜利前进，我们期待着甘肃省的新的胜利。
