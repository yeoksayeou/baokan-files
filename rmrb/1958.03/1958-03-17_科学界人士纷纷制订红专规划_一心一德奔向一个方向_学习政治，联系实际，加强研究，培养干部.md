    Scientific Community Actively Formulating "Red and Expert" Plans
    Uniting in Purpose Towards a Single Direction
    Studying Politics, Connecting with Reality, Strengthening Research, Cultivating Cadres
    (Our dispatch) People in the scientific and technological fields are actively formulating plans, striving to be both "Red and Expert" and achieve a double leap forward. "Giving our hearts to the Party and always following the Party!" "Studying politics and not being a pragmatist who loses direction!" - This has become the common language of many scientists. Many people have put forward plans to strengthen scientific research and cultivate young scientific workers in their plans.

    Lin Qiaozhi, Director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, expressed her determination to be a left-wing intellectual and to move towards the standards of a Communist Party member. She plans to organize obstetricians and gynecologists to systematically summarize the clinical data accumulated over the past ten years of collective labor to enrich the motherland's obstetrics and gynecology, to complete eleven special studies in stages within five years, and to train twelve people with the level of assistant researchers or above, and thirty resident physicians. Zhang Xiaoqian, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine, proposed to give his heart and organization to the Party, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, and read newspapers every day. He plans to directly participate in the research on peptic ulcers, including the research on traditional Chinese medicine therapies; together with relevant medical science workers across the country, he will basically complete the investigation of the incidence of ulcer disease nationwide within three years, summarize the clinical characteristics of the disease in my country, and formulate prevention and treatment plans. He also plans to train ten to twelve internists with the level of attending physicians or above within five years, and to receive some graduate students and advanced students.

    Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University and physicist, proposed in his plan: to read six classic works in detail within five years, including the History of the Chinese Revolution and Dialectics of Nature, Materialism and Empirio-criticism. Teachers of the History Department of Nankai University proposed to systematically criticize bourgeois ideology within two years, focusing on criticizing Lei Haizong's reactionary historical views. They put forward the slogan "Destroy the White, Establish the Red," "Two years of criticism, two years of training, five years of becoming completely Red." Yang Shixian, President of Nankai University and chemist, proposed in his plan to step up pesticide research and cultivate a research base in the Chemistry Department of Nanda. Yang Xuehan, a professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tianjin University, representing the Tianjin Science Popularization Association, stated: During the second five-year plan period, in coordination with relevant industrial departments, professional and technical training courses will be held to raise 500 technicians to the level of engineers and train 20% of workers above the sixth grade to the level of technicians, and also train more than 10,000 various agricultural technicians and skilled workers for rural areas.

    Si Xingjian, Ma Rongzhi, Zhang Yuzhe, and other thirty-seven senior researchers from the Nanjing District of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, proposed to respond to the proposal of the seventeen scientists in Shanghai by strengthening labor training, integrating with workers and peasants, actively supporting industrial and agricultural production, and vigorously cultivating young scientific cadres.

    Twenty scientific workers in Zhejiang Province, including Ding Zhenlin, formulated the "Red and Expert Planning Covenant." The covenant stated that it is necessary to correctly handle the contradictions between individual interests and collective interests and national interests, put national interests and collective interests above individual interests, resolutely overcome all forms of bourgeois individualism, and consciously obey organizational arrangements.

    After holding the third plenary meeting of its academic committee, the Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Lushun-Dalian City put forward a proposal to petroleum science and technology workers across the country and the scientific and technological circles of Lushun-Dalian City to strive to become working-class intellectuals who are both Red and Expert, and even more Red and Expert as soon as possible. Their specific measures are first: to actively participate in the rectification movement, earnestly study documents, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to bring about a major revolution in stance, viewpoint, and method.

    科学界人士纷纷制订红专规划
    一心一德奔向一个方向
    学习政治，联系实际，加强研究，培养干部
    本报讯　科学技术界人士正在纷纷制订规划，争取又红又专，双双跃进。“把心交给党，永远跟着党走！”“学习政治，不做迷失方向的实际家！”——这已成为许多科学家的共同语言。许多人在规划中，都提出了加强科学研究和培养青年科学工作者的计划。
    中国医学科学院妇产科主任林巧稚提出决心做左派知识分子，并向共产党员的标准迈进。她准备组织妇产科医师有计划地总结十年来集体劳动所积累的临床资料，以充实祖国妇产科学，在五年内分期完成十一个专题研究，并培养出助理研究员水平以上的人员十二人，住院医师三十人。内科系主任张孝骞提出要把心交给党和组织，认真学习马列主义，每日阅读报纸。他准备直接参加消化性溃疡的研究工作，包括中医疗法的研究；与全国有关医学科学工作者一起，在三年内基本完成全国溃疡病发病率的调查，总结出该病在我国的临床特点，从而制订出防治方案。他还计划在五年内培养出具有主治医师以上水平的内科医师十到十二人，并接收一些研究生和进修生。
    天津大学校长、物理学家张国藩的规划中提出：五年内要精读中国革命史和自然辩证法、唯物论和经验批判论等六部经典著作。南开大学历史系教师们提出两年要以批判雷海宗反动的历史观点为重点，系统批判资产阶级思想。他们提出“破白立红”“两年批判、两年锻炼、五年红透”的口号。南开大学校长、化学家杨石先在规划中提出要加紧进行农药研究工作，在南大化学系培养一个研究基地。天津大学机械系教授杨学涵代表天津市科学普及协会表示：在第二个五年计划期间，与有关工业部门配合，举办专业技术学习班，把五百名技术人员提高到工程师的水平，把20％的六级以上的工人培养成技术员的水平，还为农村培养一万多名各种农业技术人员和技术工人。
    中国科学院南京区高级研究人员斯行健、马溶之、张钰哲等三十七人，提出要用加强劳动锻炼、和工农打成一片，积极支援工农业生产，以及大力培养青年科学干部等行动来响应上海十七位科学家的倡议。
    浙江省的科学工作者丁振麟等二十人制定了“红专规划公约”。公约说，要正确地处理个人利益与集体利益、国家利益的矛盾，把国家利益和集体利益放在个人利益之上，坚决克服形形色色的资产阶级个人主义，自觉地服从组织分配。
    在旅大市的中国科学院石油研究所在召开了该所学术委员会第三次全体会议以后，向全国石油科学技术工作者和旅大市科学技术界提出一项争取尽快成为又红又专更红更专的工人阶级知识分子的建议。他们的具体措施首先是：积极投入整风运动、认真学习文件，开展批评和自我批评，来一个立场、观点、方法上的大革命。
