Ten Thousand Horses Galloping

By our correspondents Ji Yin, Xi Ping

To describe the current anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement in Shanghai with the idiom "ten thousand horses galloping" is most appropriate. Now, the great airing of views and debates against waste and conservatism in Shanghai has reached its climax. Sixty million big-character posters and thousands of various exhibitions have formed a powerful and invincible torrent, impacting all economically, operationally, and ideologically conservative and backward phenomena. This anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement has become the most profound and widespread great revolutionary movement in Shanghai since liberation. People are using various lively working methods, boldly creating and continuing to create endless amazing miracles...

The Spring of "Jiangnan"

In Shanghai's "Double Anti" movement, factories and enterprises have always been the vanguard. Thousands of factories, from small factories with only a few people to large factories with tens of thousands of people, from advanced factories to old factories, have all been swept into this revolutionary torrent, launching a competition to "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced." Among these activities, the recent example of Jiangnan Shipyard humbling itself to learn from small factories is one of the most interesting events.

Jiangnan Shipyard, with its thousands of workers and modern equipment, from February 11th to 15th, sent a total of one hundred and thirty-two people, including Party secretaries, factory directors, workshop directors, section chiefs, team leaders, production workers, material clerks, warehouse managers, etc., to visit five small factories, including the Far East Boiler Factory and Yongda Iron Foundry. During the visits, the spirit of hard work, simple construction, careful calculation, and love for the factory as home demonstrated by the workers of the small factories deeply moved everyone. Seeing how the small factory workers cherished tools and raw materials, they were reminded of the extravagant and careless, always seeking the best and newest, "young master" style in their own factory. Many employees conveyed their impressions at group or team airing of views meetings on the evening of their return to the factory, and also used big-character posters and radio stations to express their feelings. Many veteran workers said that they had been in the big factory for too long and had forgotten the past situation. Now, in comparison, everything was shocking.

After the visit, the employees of Jiangnan Shipyard compared the various indicators of their factory with those of other shipyards, drew them into charts, and held an exhibition. For example, if Jiangnan Factory could reach the 93.11% annual time utilization rate of the China Shipyard, it could save 1.1 million yuan per year. In terms of forging quota hours, it took Jiangnan Factory 506 hours to make a six-hour rudder post, while Shanghai Shipyard only needed 184 hours. The profit rate created by each thousand yuan of capital per year was 186 yuan for Shanghai Shipyard, but only 72 yuan for Jiangnan Factory, even less than the annual interest on bank deposits. ... These vivid facts were shocking and thought-provoking. After seeing the exhibition, an old worker shook his head and said, "Why are we like this?" Some also said, "This comparison clears my head; before, we closed the door and thought we were number one in everything."

It was not easy for the leaders and the masses of workers at Jiangnan Factory to humble themselves and learn from other factories. In their self-criticism to the workers' representative assembly, the factory leaders said: For many years, we have always considered ourselves the "big brother," only seeing others asking for our help, and disdaining to ask for help from others. We often overestimated the good conditions of others and emphasized our special circumstances when they had good experiences and achievements. We closed ourselves off and were ignorant. Some veteran workers in the factory also refused to go out to study because those in other factories were their apprentices. However, the vigorous anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement finally broke through their doors and brought a vibrant spring to Jiangnan Factory.

From 24 to 39

In these days of ten thousand horses galloping, not only are more than ten thousand factories in Shanghai so busy and tense, but the same tension and excitement prevails in photography studios and creative studios. The "Double Anti" movement is the guiding principle for driving all work. Following the Shanghai factory workers, Shanghai's cultural and artistic circles have also caught up recently. The drama circles, film circles, ballad singing circles, publishing circles, music circles... all have sent out a wave of great leaps forward. The script shortage, which was once considered difficult to overcome in the short term, is no longer heard. Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, Shanghai People's Art Theatre, Shanghai Film Company... have all proposed a large number of creative plans.

It is worth mentioning the Shanghai film industry. Right-wing elements once struck an anti-Party "film gong" here, stirring up an anti-Party black wind, but they quickly failed. And now, the real great march film gong has sounded, its sound is so loud, so exciting. It is said that the Shanghai Film Company originally only planned to shoot a dozen feature films this year, later revised to twenty, and then increased to twenty-four. By March 3rd, they had surged to thirty-nine, and challenged fraternal units across the country. In recent days, the production staff has been working day and night. Some are shooting on location in rural areas, and some are shooting interiors in the factory. The preparatory work for the wide-screen film "The New Biography of an Old Soldier" produced by Haiyan Film Studio is also ready. Director Shen Fu went to the Great Northern Wilderness of Northeast China a few days ago to scout locations and shoot snow scenes. The crew of a new film "The Cuckoo Cries Again" produced by Tianma Film Studio is shooting on location in Suzhou. The factory is shooting a children's story film "Lanlan and Dongdong." The work of directors and screenwriters is also particularly intense. The directors are writing scene scripts for the films that are about to be shot. Cinematographers, stage artists, and lighting workers are also racking their brains, preparing to contribute their wisdom and experience to improve production quality and reduce costs. The cost of each film produced by Tianma Film Studio last year was about 220,000 yuan. This year, the company leaders have set the cost at more than 190,000 yuan. Now, the employees have proposed that the average should only be more than 120,000 yuan.

Another "Seven Nos"

In the city-wide "Double Anti" upsurge, Shanghai has recently put forward a new "Seven Nos." This is not the "Seven Nos" of eliminating seven kinds of pests in the patriotic health campaign, but the "Seven Nos" of eliminating seven kinds of bad social phenomena: "No theft, no gambling, no fire, no unreported or uncancelled household registrations, no major counter-revolutionary sabotage accidents, no hooligan activities, no fatal traffic accidents." On March 3rd, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau held a general meeting of all cadres and police officers, and everyone enthusiastically proposed to strive to achieve "Seven Nos" in 70% of the areas in Shanghai within the year.

To achieve "Seven Nos" in Shanghai, a city with a population of more than seven million and such complex conditions, within a year was simply unimaginable in the past. However, in the current revolutionary torrent that is sweeping away all conservatism and backwardness, since other miracles can occur, why can't this miracle be achieved? Also on March 3rd, a resident in the jurisdiction of the Zhongzhou Road Police Station in Shanghai confessed his theft and handed over more than fifty kilograms of copper wire he had stolen. The police station has decided not to punish him. In the jurisdiction of the Tiantong'an Road Police Station, a person who had repeatedly committed theft posted five big-character posters in a row, expressing his determination not to repeat the offense. Two hooligans from the Second Residents Committee of Xibaoxing Road also posted big-character posters, expressing that they would no longer be hooligans and advising other hooligans to mend their ways.

The great "Double Anti" movement is not only bringing hundreds of millions of material wealth to Shanghai, but also profoundly transforming the spiritual outlook of society. This is why a city like Shanghai can put forward such a shocking slogan as "Seven Nos."

Solidarity Promotion Association

The Marine Fisheries Department of Shanghai Fisheries College recently held a "Solidarity Promotion Association." The director of the department's teaching and research office and veteran teachers attended. Originally, there was a long-term lack of unity among Professor Wang Yiguan and Associate Professors Gao Hongzhang and Wang Yousheng in the Marine Fisheries Department, which affected the work. Professor Wang Yiguan advocated the use of "surrounding nets" in fishing grounds, while Associate Professor Wang Yousheng advocated the use of "trawling." The two had different views and did not convince each other, and even did not greet each other when they met. Many big-character posters in the department criticized them. At this "Solidarity Promotion Association," the three made self-criticisms, shook hands tightly, and resolved to promote unity and jointly leap forward in the current socialist great leap forward.

Many big-character posters in the college mentioned the problem of disunity and lack of cooperation among veteran professors. This was a common problem in the school, which affected the exertion of the potential of veteran professors and had not been resolved for a long time. But this time the situation has changed. The president and veteran professor and director of the aquaculture department, Chen Ziying, saw the big-character posters criticizing the disunity between them. They wrote a big-character poster together in Professor Chen Ziying's home that night, jointly signed it, and expressed that they would further unite and cooperate, support each other, and make every effort to carry out scientific research and work together to make China's fisheries science catch up with the international advanced level as soon as possible. The two professors, who had studied at the same university, now shook hands again and said that in today's Great Leap Forward, we are determined to eliminate all past misunderstandings and prejudices and dedicate all our strength to the great cause of socialism.

Burning in All Directions

In the big-character poster clusters of many units in Shanghai, many new big-character posters have appeared in recent days. These big-character posters are not written by the staff of the unit, but are sent from outside.

In the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Building, many big-character posters sent from various bureaus and district-level organs are posted. The big-character posters criticized some meetings of the Municipal People's Committee for their poor quality, too rigid working methods, bureaucracy, and the officialdom and lethargy of some cadres in a sincere and sharp manner. At the same time, they also put forward many work suggestions. This kind of big-character poster criticizing the superiors by the subordinates also appeared in the buildings of various professional bureaus. As of March 3rd, the East China Textile Administration Bureau had received 475 big-character posters from various units. Mutual criticism and mutual assistance between commercial and industrial departments are even more widespread. A commodity inspection section of the China Department Store Purchasing Station sent more than 1,000 big-character posters to relevant professional companies and factories, sharply criticizing the shortcomings in commodity quality and putting forward many rationalization proposals. A big-character poster sent to the Enamel Industry Company said: "Currently, batches of Shanghai enamel products are sent to the China Department Store warehouse to sleep. What is the reason? You probably also know that the colors and patterns of enamel products have lagged behind those of other places. The Northeast region has long been ahead of Shanghai. ..." This kind of mutually critical big-character poster is also appearing in other departments and factories. It shows that Shanghai's "Double Anti" movement is deepening and widening.

In order to burn down conservative and backward phenomena, in order to make Shanghai's face new, the fire of Shanghai's "Double Anti" is still burning fiercely. ...

    万马奔腾
    本报记者　季音　习平
    用万马奔腾这个形容词，来描述目前上海的反浪费反保守运动，是再恰当没有了。现在上海的反浪费、反保守的大鸣大放已经达到最高潮，六千万张大字报，形形色色数以千计的展览会，组成了一股强大无敌的巨流，冲激着一切经济上工作上和思想上的保守落后现象。这次反浪费、反保守运动，已成了解放以来上海一次最深刻、最广泛的伟大革命运动。人们运用着各种生动活泼的工作方法，大胆地创造了并且正在继续创造着无穷无尽的惊人奇迹……
      “江南”的春天
    在上海的这次“双反”运动中，工厂企业一直是运动的急先锋。成千上万的工厂，从仅有几个人的小厂，到上万人的大厂；从先进的厂，到老大厂，没有一个不被卷进了这革命的激流，展开了“学先进、赶先进”的竞赛。在这些活动中，最近江南造船厂放下架子学习小厂是最有趣的事件之一。
    拥有上万工人和近代设备的江南造船厂，自2月11日至15日，全厂共有一百三十二人，包括党委书记、厂长、车间主任、科长、工段长、生产工人、材料员、仓库管理员等，先后参观了远东锅炉厂、永大铸铁厂等五个小厂。在参观中，小厂职工艰苦奋斗、因陋就简地进行建设，精打细算、爱厂如家的精神，都使大家很激动。看到小厂工人爱护工具、爱护原材料的情况，就联想到自己厂里大手大脚、求好求新，什么都不在乎的大少爷作风。许多职工回厂当天晚上就在小组或工段的鸣放会上进行了传达，又利用大字报、广播台说出自己的感想。许多老工人说，自己在大厂呆久了，过去的情况淡忘了，现在对比之下，处处触目惊心。
    江南造船厂职工在参观以后，把自己厂里的各项指标与别的船厂对比，画成图表，开了一个展览会。比如，年时间使用率，如果江南厂能够达到中华厂的93.11％，全年就可节约一百一十万元。锻工定额工时，江南厂做一只六时舵杆要五百零六小时，上海船厂只要一百八十四小时。每千元资金每年创造利润率，上海船厂是一百八十六元，江南厂只有七十二元，比银行存款一年利息还少。……这些生动事实振动人心，发人深省。有个老工人看了这个展览会后，摇摇头说：“什么道理我们会这样呢？”也有人说：“这样一对比，头脑就清醒了；以前是关起门来以为什么都是我们第一。”
    江南厂领导人与职工群众能够放下架子虚心向别厂学习，并不是容易的事。这个厂的领导人在向职工代表大会的检查中说：多少年来，我们总以“老大”自居，只看到人家有求于我们，我们不屑去求助于人家，人家有好的经验、成绩，我们也往往过高估计人家好的条件，强调情况特殊。闭关自守，坐井观天。这个厂的有些老工人也因为在别厂的都是自己的师弟、徒弟，不肯出外学习。可是轰轰烈烈的反浪费反保守运动终于冲开了他们的大门，给江南厂带来了生气勃勃的春天。
        从24到39
    在这个万马奔腾的日子里，不但上海一万多个工厂都是那么忙碌和紧张，在摄影场里，创作室里，也同样的紧张和兴奋。“双反”运动是带动一切工作的纲。随着上海工厂职工之后，上海文化艺术界最近也赶了上来，戏剧界，电影界，曲艺界，出版界，音乐界……都传来了一片跃进之声。曾经被认为在短期内很难克服的剧本荒，现在再也听不到了。上海越剧院，上海人民艺术剧院，上海电影公司……都提出了大量的创作计划。
    值得提一提的是上海电影界。右派分子曾经在这里敲过一阵反党的“电影锣鼓”，煽起过一股反党的黑风，但是他们很快就失败了。而现在，真正的大进军的电影锣鼓响起来了，它的声音是那么嘹亮，那么激动人心。据说，上海电影公司今年故事片生产计划原来只打算拍十几部，后来修改为二十部，又增加到二十四部，到3月3日，他们已激增为三十九部，并且向全国兄弟单位提出了挑战。这些天来，摄制人员正在夜以继日地忙碌着，有的在外地农村拍外景，有的在厂里拍内景。海燕厂拍摄的宽银幕电影“老兵新传”的准备工作也已就绪，导演沈浮于前几天已到东北北大荒看外景，同时抢拍雪景。天马厂一部新片“布谷鸟又叫了”，摄制人员正在苏州拍摄外景。厂里正在拍摄一部儿童故事片“兰兰与冬冬”。导演编剧们的工作也显得特别紧张，即将开拍的影片，导演们都已纷纷在写分镜头剧本了。摄影师、舞台美工以及照明工人们也纷纷动脑筋，准备为提高摄制质量、减低成本贡献出自己的智慧和经验。天马厂去年每部影片的成本是二十二万元左右，今年公司领导上定下的成本是十九万多元，现在，职工们提出，平均只要十二万多元。
      又一个“七无”
    在激荡全市的双反高潮中，上海最近又提出了一个新的“七无”，这不是爱国卫生运动中消灭七种害虫的“七无”，而是消除七种社会不良现象的七无：“无盗窃，无赌博，无火灾，无不报不销的户口，无反革命重大破坏事故，无流氓阿飞活动，无死亡交通事故”。3月3日，上海公安局开了个全体干部民警大会，大家干劲百倍地提出要争取在年内，在上海70％的地区实现“七无”。
    拥有七百多万人口，情况那么复杂的上海要在年内实现“七无”，这在过去是简直不可想像的。但是，在当前冲刷着一切保守落后的革命激流中，既然能够出现其它的种种奇迹，为什么不能实现这个奇迹呢？也就是3月3日，上海中州路派出所辖区的一个居民，向派出所坦白了自己的偷窃行为，并交出他所偷窃的铜丝五十多斤。派出所已决定对他不予以处分。天通庵路派出所辖区也有一个屡犯偷窃行为的人，一连贴了五张大字报，表示决心不再重犯。西宝兴路第二居民委员会有两个流氓阿飞，也贴了大字报，表示不再做流氓，并劝告其他阿飞也要改邪归正。
    伟大的“双反”运动，不但正在为上海带来亿万物质财富，而且也在深刻地改造着社会的精神面貌。这也就是为什么像上海这样的城市，竟然能提出“七无”这种惊人口号的理由。
        团结促进会
    上海水产学院海洋渔业系里最近开了个“团结促进会”，系里的教研室主任和老教师都参加了。原来，海洋渔业系教授王贻观和副教授高鸿章、王友声三人之间，过去长期闹不团结，影响工作。王贻观教授主张渔场采取“围网”，而王友声副教授主张“拖网”，两人主张不同，互不服气，甚至见面也不打招呼。系里的许多大字报，批评了他们。这次“团结促进会”上，三人相互检讨，紧紧握手，决心在当前社会主义大跃进中，搞好团结，共同跃进。
    这个学院的许多大字报都提到了老教授之间不团结、不合作的问题。这是这个学校带有普遍性的问题，影响了老教授潜力的发挥，长期未曾解决。但这次情况变化了，院长和老教授兼养殖系主任陈子英，看到大字报上批评他们之间不团结，晚上就在陈子英教授家里，二人合写一张大字报，共同签了名，表示今后要进一步地团结和协作，互相支援，全力进行科学研究，为我国水产科学早日赶上国际先进水平而共同努力。这两位曾经在一个大学里读过书的教授，现在重新握手言欢说，在大跃进的今天，我们坚决要消除过去一切误会与成见，把自己的一切力量献给社会主义伟大事业。
        烧向四面八方
    上海许多单位的大字报丛里，这几天出现了许多新的大字报。这些大字报不是出自本单位工作人员的手笔，而是外面送去的。
    在上海市人民委员会大楼，张贴着许多从各局和区级机关送来的大字报。大字报中肯而又尖锐地批评了市人委某些会议质量不高、工作方法太死、文牍主义等缺点和部分干部的官气和暮气。同时也提出许多工作上的建议。这种下级对上级进行批评的大字报，也出现在各个专业局的大楼里。华东纺织管理局到3月3日为止，已经收到各单位的大字报四百七十五张。商业部门和工业部门之间，相互批评、相互帮助更为广泛。中国百货公司采购站一个商品检验科向各有关专业公司和工厂送出了一千多张大字报，既尖锐地批评了商品质量上的缺点，也提出了许多合理化建议。有一张送给搪瓷工业公司的大字报说：“目前，上海搪瓷产品一批批送进中百公司仓库睡觉，什么原因，大概你们也知道，搪瓷品的色彩、花样已经落后于外地，东北地区早就跑在上海前面了。……”这种相互批评的大字报，也正在其他部门和工厂里出现着。它表明上海的“双反”运动已经日益深入和广泛。
    为了烧毁保守落后现象，为了使上海的面貌一新，上海的“双反”之火还在熊熊燃烧着……。
