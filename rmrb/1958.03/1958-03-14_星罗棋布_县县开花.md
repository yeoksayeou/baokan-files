	Scattered Like Stars, Blooming in Every County
	Jing Yu

	To have small-scale fertilizer plants scattered like stars and blooming in every county – this is a large-scale plan for developing the chemical industry recently proposed by the Ministry of Chemical Industry. According to this plan, they are rushing to create a standardized design for small-scale fertilizer plants for use by counties across the country. This is encouraging news.

	The foundation of China's fertilizer industry is very weak. In 1952, the national output of chemical fertilizers was only 194,000 tons. Last year, it increased to more than 700,000 tons. Although production has developed rapidly, calculated according to China's cultivated area, the average yield is still less than one jin per mu. In order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, fertilizer production must also have a leap forward. To develop fertilizer production, on the one hand, we must rely on the state to build large factories, and on the other hand, we must build more small factories as soon as possible. According to the standardized design of small-scale fertilizer plants by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, a liquid fertilizer plant with an annual output of 8,000 tons can be built in just five or six months. The investment is much less than that of large factories. Such factories can be established in general county towns and small towns.

	Vigorously developing small and medium-sized factories is the concrete implementation of the principle of combining large, medium, and small [enterprises] and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in China's industrial construction. If a country wants to industrialize, it must have large-scale industries, which are the backbone of industrialization. Without a backbone, it cannot stand tall. However, if we only rely on large-scale industries and look down on small-scale industries, it is also impossible to accelerate the speed of China's industrialization. In the past, some people always felt that large was better than small. Now, it seems that we should have a sufficient estimate of the small. Although small cannot completely replace large, large cannot completely undertake the tasks undertaken by small.

	Small means "many." Because the characteristics of small are: little investment, small footprint, simple equipment, and convenient operation. A county with a population of 200,000 can build a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 8,000 tons for 17.5 yuan per person. Every county has the strength to run such a plant. If each of the more than 2,000 counties in the country establishes one, wouldn't that be more than 2,000? Isn't more than 2,000 a lot?

	Small means "fast." Because it is small, the construction time is very short. A fertilizer plant with an annual output of 8,000 tons can be built in just five or six months. Isn't this faster than building a large factory in four years?

	Small means "economical." The "economical" mentioned here not only means less investment and faster construction, but also because it uses local materials and sells locally, saving the busy transportation and transshipment, and its production cost is also likely to be relatively low.

	Things that are more, faster, and more economical should also meet the "good" standard.

	In farmland water conservancy, many places have a layout like grape bunches and stars in the sky. Now, farmland water conservancy can no longer claim to be the only beautiful one. Small-scale industries scattered like stars and blooming everywhere will compete with grape bunches for beauty. Small-scale fertilizer plants will bloom the first flower in the county, and then small-scale agricultural machinery plants, small-scale iron smelting plants, small-scale… will soon follow suit. At that time, the name "grape bunch" will not be a special term for water conservancy, but a term shared with local industry.

    星罗棋布  县县开花
    静宇
    让小型化肥厂星罗棋布、县县开花，这是化学工业部最近提出来的一个大规模发展化学工业的方案。根据这个方案，他们正在赶制小型化肥厂的定型设计，供全国各县采用。这是一件振奋人心的消息。
    我国化肥工业的基础很差。1952年，全国化学肥料的产量不过十九万四千吨，去年提高到七十多万吨，虽然生产发展很快，可是按照我国耕种面积来计算，平均每亩仍得不到一斤。为了适应农业大跃进的需要，化肥产量也必需有一个跃进。发展化肥生产，一方面要依靠国家建设大厂，另一方面也要尽快地多建小厂。根据化工部小型化肥厂的定型设计，一个年产八千吨的液体化肥厂，只要五六个月的时间就建成了，投资比大厂也要省得多，这种厂一般县城和小市镇都有条件举办。
    大力发展中小型工厂，是我国工业建设中大中小结合与多、快、好、省方针的具体实施。一个国家要工业化，就必须要有大型工业，它是工业化的骨干，没有骨干就不能顶天立地。但是，如果仅仅依靠大工业，瞧不起小工业，也不可能加快我国工业化的速度。过去，有些人总觉得大比小好，现在看来，对小的应该有个足够的估计。小的虽然不能完全代替大的，大的也确实不能完全承担小的所承担的任务。
    小就是“多”。因为小的特点是：投资很少，占地不大，设备简易，操作方便，一个二十万人口的县，每人花十七元五角，就可办个年产八千吨的化肥厂。这种厂，那个县都有力量举办。全国两千多个县，如果每县办一个，不就是两千多个吗？两千多个不是很多吗？
    小就是“快”。因为小，建设时间很短，一个年产八千吨的化肥厂，只要五六个月就可建成，这比起四年建成一个大厂来不是很快吗？
    小就是“省”。这里所说的“省”，不仅是说投资少，建厂快，而且还由于它就地取材，就地销售，省得交通转运的繁忙，其生产成本也很可能是比较低的。
    又多、又快、又省的事情，也应该合乎“好”的标准了。
    在农田水利上，许多地方有葡萄串、满天星的布局。现在，农田水利已经不能专美于前了。星罗棋布，处处开花的小型工业将与葡萄串争相比美。小型化肥厂在县里开放第一枝花，接着，小型农械厂、小型炼铁厂、小型……很快跟着开花了，那时候，“葡萄串”的名字，不是水利的专有名词，而是同地方工业一起共有的名词了。
