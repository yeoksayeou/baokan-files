Chengdu dispatch from our newspaper, reporter Ji Xichen: As the spring plowing arrives, in order to enable basic construction such as water conservancy to be carried out year-round, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to organize a basic construction team of 500,000 people within agricultural cooperatives throughout the province to specifically undertake technical construction work. After the winter, through the hard work of 20 million people, by the end of February, Sichuan Province had completed the task of expanding the irrigated area by more than 15.5 million mu, and water and soil conservation and soil improvement by more than 19.5 million mu. At present, all localities are continuing their efforts to expand the results. In order to timely resolve the contradiction between water conservancy construction and spring plowing production competing for labor, to uniformly arrange labor, to ensure that many unfinished projects are completed, and to ensure the quality of various projects, the Provincial Party Committee has decided that all townships with a large number of basic construction tasks should draw a certain amount of labor from each cooperative, draw a certain amount of funds from public accumulation, and add special tools (more from large townships and less from small townships) to organize a basic construction team of about 100 people. On the premise of not hindering spring plowing, the basic construction team will carry out water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and water and soil conservation work for a long time. The approach is to work hard during the slack season and work less during the busy season.

In Xiangbi Township, Yibin County, the 120-person basic construction team organized by 29 agricultural cooperatives has generally improved work efficiency by one or two times due to the fixed personnel, neat attendance, and skilled technology. During labor, the basic construction team continuously cultivates and trains technical personnel. More than 20 people in the team have learned how to use leveling instruments, design repairs, drill blasting holes, and carpentry skills, so that water conservancy technology has taken root in the agricultural cooperative. When carrying out water conservancy construction and water conservancy maintenance work in the entire township, they sign a contract with each agricultural cooperative through the township people's committee according to the size and difficulty of the project, so as to achieve "fixed time and quality." Within the team, work is calculated by the cubic meter, and scores are based on labor. Work points are settled once a month. The work points of the basic construction team members are transferred to the agricultural cooperative where they are located and participate in the annual distribution as agricultural work points.

    四川组织五十万人的基本建设队
    农业生产和建设两不误
    本报成都电  记者纪希晨报道：当春耕到来的时候，为了使水利等基本建设能够常年进行，中共四川省委决定在全省农业社内组织五十万人的基本建设队伍，专门担负技术性建设工作。入冬以后，经过两千万人的苦干，至2月底，四川省已经完成扩大灌溉面积一千五百多万亩，水土保持、改良土壤一千九百多万亩的任务。目前各地正再接再厉，扩大战果。为及时解决兴修水利和春耕生产互争劳动力的矛盾，统一安排劳动力，使许多未完工程坚持到底，并确保各项工程质量，省委决定凡是基本建设任务较多的各乡，都从各社中抽出一定人力，从公共积累中抽出一定资金，添置专用工具（大乡多抽，小乡少抽），组织成百人左右的基本建设队伍，在不妨碍春耕前提下，通过基建队把兴修水利、改良土壤、水土保持等工作长期坚持下来，做法是农闲大干，农忙小干。
    在宜宾县象鼻乡，由二十九个农业社组织的一百二十人的基建队，由于人员固定，出工整齐，技术熟练，因而工效普遍提高一两倍。劳动中，基建队不断培养训练技术人材，全队已有二十余人学会看水平仪、设计修理、打炮眼和土木工手艺，使水利技术在农业社生了根。他们在进行全乡兴修水利和水利养护工作时，按工程大小、难易，通过乡人民委员会与各农业社订立承包合同，做到“定时、定质”。队内则按方计工，按劳评分，工分一月结算一次。基本建设队员的工分转入各人所在农业社，作为农业工分参加当年分配。
