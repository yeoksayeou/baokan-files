Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 7th. A large-scale new petroleum city is under construction in Maoming County, Guangdong Province. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in 1962. Now, a nine-story-high petroleum refining furnace has been erected on the construction site, and oil refining can begin in early March. After the entire petroleum city is completed, it will use oil shale to refine large quantities of ordinary gasoline and high-grade fuel oil. In addition, a large amount of by-product ammonium sulfate (nitrogen fertilizer) can be produced annually.
  The Maoming shale oil mine has very rich reserves, a high oil content, and a simple deposit structure, with excellent conditions for open-pit mining.

    茂名兴建石油城
    新华社广州7日电　一座规模巨大的新石油城正在广东省茂名县兴建。第一期工程预计在1962年完成。现在，九层楼高的石油试炼炉已矗立在工地上，3月初便可开始炼油。这座石油城全部建成后，将要利用油母页岩大量炼制普通汽油和高级燃料油。此外，每年还可以生产大量副产品——硫酸铵（氮肥）。
  茂名页岩油矿的储藏量非常丰富，含油率很高，矿床的构造简单，具有优越的露天开采条件。
