Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 9th - Leading departments of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee are moving out of the provincial committee's office buildings in batches to work in rural and industrial areas. Nine hundred and sixty-seven cadres (including forty-six at the department and bureau level) drawn from provincial-level leadership organs will go down to the grassroots starting from the 10th to engage in "experimental fields." County and district committees are also taking action, universally promoting "experimental fields." Gansu Province is carrying out a major revolution in leadership style with swift and decisive momentum.

In these few short days, the Provincial Committee's Finance and Trade Department, Political and Legal Department, and Industrial and Transportation Department have already moved to grassroots factories and agricultural areas to work. The cadres of these departments have begun to eat, live, and labor alongside the masses. The new office of the Industrial and Transportation Department was moved to an old warehouse of an iron factory. The morning after moving, they convened a meeting of the party secretaries of directly subordinate factories and mining enterprises to deploy new work.

In its resolution on realizing a revolution in leadership style, the Provincial Committee selected five counties and cities—Wuwei, Huixian, Yuzhong, Gaolan, and Lanzhou—as the focal points for the Provincial Committee to establish "experimental fields." Some of these places are drought-stricken areas with extremely harsh conditions, some are resource-rich mountainous areas, and some are emerging industrial zones, each with different characteristics. The more than nine hundred and sixty cadres who have been transferred will establish "experimental fields" in these locations based on their different areas of expertise, in order to diligently study for two years, explore experience in running local industries and complete sets of capital construction in industry, and explore experience in conquering drought and building water conservancy projects in agriculture.

The Provincial Committee's leadership core and its affiliated departments and commissions have also decided to rely on the "experimental fields" in these five key counties and cities to implement cross-flow office work. When problems are discovered or advanced experience is explored there, on-site meetings will be held and visits will be organized there to promote overall progress through key points. In addition to participating in local "experimental fields," responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee will also take turns to inspect work in various parts of the province. It is estimated that two-thirds of the cadres specifically drawn by the Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Committee to engage in "experimental fields" and to conduct roving inspections will be involved.

While vigorously promoting "experimental fields," the Provincial Committee has also stipulated a set of comparison methods for comparing drive, comparing experience, and comparing quality, requiring comparisons to be made between individuals and individuals, units and units, systems and systems, wherever conditions are equal and comparable. Evaluations will be conducted twice a year, with a final general comparison at the end of the year. The Provincial Committee also emphasized the need to properly arrange time, ensuring that rectification, experimentation, work, and study are not neglected.

    在工业和农业中摸索一套经验
    甘肃大规模搞“试验田”
    新华社兰州9日电　中共甘肃省委的各领导部门正在分批离开省委的办公大楼，搬到农村和工业地区去办公。从省级领导机关中抽调的九百六十七个干部（其中有厅、部长级干部四十六人），将从10日起，陆续下到基层搞“试验田”。各县委、地委也行动起来，普遍推行“试验田”。甘肃省正以雷厉风行之势，进行领导作风的大革命。
    在这短短几天中，已经搬到基层工厂和农业地区办公的有省委财贸部、政法部和工业交通部，这些部的干部已开始和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。工业交通部的新办公室搬在一家铁工厂的旧仓库里，他们在搬家后的次晨，就召开直属厂矿企业党委书记会议，布置了新工作。
    省委在关于实现领导作风革命的决议中，选定武威、徽县、榆中、皋兰、兰州五个县市为省委搞“试验田”的重点，这些地方，有的是条件非常恶劣的干旱地区，有的是资源丰富的高山区，有的是新兴工业区，各有不同的特点。所抽调的九百六十多个干部，就是在这些点上根据不同的业务建立“试验田”，以便苦钻二年，在工业中摸索出办地方工业和全套基本建设等的经验，在农业中摸出战胜干旱、兴修水利的经验。
    省委领导核心和所属部、委，也决定依托这五个重点县市的“试验田”，实行交叉流动办公。那里发现问题或摸索到先进经验，就在那里召开现场会议和组织参观，以重点来推动全面。省委负责同志除参加当地“试验田”外，还要轮流到省内各地巡回检查工作。预计省委和省人民委员会专门抽调搞“试验田”的和到基层进行巡回检查工作干部，将达全部人员的三分之二。
    在大力推行“试验田”的同时，省委还规定了一套比干劲、比经验、比质量的评比办法，要求个人与个人、单位与单位、系统与系统间，凡条件同等可比者都要比。一年评比两次，年终总比一次。省委还强调要妥善安排时间，必需做到整风、试验、工作、学习四不误。
