Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 7th: Weiyuan County, Sichuan Province, has created a "fire-heated seedbed rapid sweet potato seedling method," which enables sweet potato planting to be moved forward by three solar terms (one and a half months) compared to previous years, increasing unit area yield by approximately 90%.

Sweet potato is a major grain crop planted in Weiyuan County. Last year, the average yield per mu was less than two thousand jin. This year, the county plans to leap forward to an average yield of three thousand five hundred jin per mu. The Weiyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly studied the situation and concluded that the most reliable guarantee for achieving this leap forward plan is to advance the sweet potato planting season. According to agricultural research and summaries, under suitable soil and fertilizer conditions, advancing sweet potato planting by one solar term can increase production by 20% to 40%. However, sweet potatoes are limited by climatic conditions. If seedlings are cultivated using the old methods of previous years, the seedlings will grow very slowly in low temperatures, making it impossible to cultivate good seedlings more than a month earlier.

The County Committee learned that Miao Guoqian, a member of the Fenglong Agricultural Cooperative's Seventh Cooperative and a junior high school student, had researched the "fire-heated bed method of cultivating sweet potato seedlings" and had achieved some results, but had not succeeded. The County Committee immediately invited him to work with agricultural technicians, the County Committee work team, and cooperative cadres to conduct joint research. After several experiments, they finally successfully tested the "fire-heated seedbed rapid sweet potato seedling method" in early February this year.

The "fire-heated bed" method is very simple and low in cost. The temperature inside the bed can be maintained between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. Under any cold climate, it can ensure that the planted sweet potato pieces germinate and grow seedlings quickly. According to research by agricultural experts and the experience of experienced farmers, the appropriate temperature for sweet potato growth and development is above 20 degrees Celsius and below 28 degrees Celsius. If the sweet potato vines can be planted one and a half months earlier, around the Grain Rain solar term, the sweet potato vines will generally grow tuberous roots half a month later. During the two months after the Grain Rain, the temperature in the Weiyuan area generally remains between 21 and 28 degrees Celsius, which is most suitable for sweet potato growth and development. At the same time, using the fire-heated seedbed seedling method, the germination rate of sweet potato seeds is very high (more than twice that of ordinary seedling methods), and the amount of seeds used per mu of sweet potatoes will also be reduced from the general requirement of 200 jin to 50 jin.

Currently, more than 2,200 fire-heated seedbeds have been built throughout the county to cultivate sweet potato seedlings, ensuring that more than 40% of the county's sweet potatoes are planted around the Grain Rain solar term. (Attached picture)

### 威远农民创造火温床快速育秧法  提早甘薯插秧　增产粮食近倍

    威远农民创造火温床快速育秧法
    提早甘薯插秧　增产粮食近倍
    据新华社成都7日电　四川省威远县创造了一种“火温床快速培育苕秧法”，能使红苕（甘薯）栽插时间比往年提早三个节气（一个半月），单位面积产量提高90％左右。
    红苕是威远县栽植的粮食主要作物，去年平均亩产不到两千斤，今年全县计划平均亩产跃进到三千五百斤。中共威远县委一再研究，认为实现这个跃进计划的最可靠保证是提早红苕的栽插季节。据农业部门的研究和总结，在土壤、肥料适当的情况下，红苕提早一个节气栽插，就能增产20％—40％。但红苕受到气候条件的限制，如果按往年的老办法育苗，在气温较低的情况下，苕苗生长很慢，不能提早一个多月育好苗。
    县委了解到奉龙农业社七社社员、初中生缪国谦曾经研究过“火炕温床培育苕秧法”，已有一定成效，但未成功。县委立即请他来同农业技术员、县委工作组和社的干部共同研究。经过几次试验，他们终于在今年2月初试验成功了“火温床快速培育苕秧法”。
    “火炕温床”的作法很简便，成本很低。床内温度能保持在摄氏二十四度到二十八度之间，在任何寒冷的气候下，都能保证种下的红苕块迅速发芽长苗。据农业专家研究和老农的经验证明，红苕生长发育的适当温度是摄氏二十度以上二十八度以下，如果能提早一个半月在谷雨前后将苕藤栽插下去，苕藤下土一般在半个月以后就长块根。谷雨后两个月中，威远一带气温一般保持在摄氏二十一度到二十八度之间最宜于红苕的生长发育。同时，采用火炕温床育苗法，红苕种的发芽率很高（比一般育苗多二倍以上），每栽一亩红苕的用种量也将由一般需要量的二百斤减少到五十斤。
    现在，全县已做了二千二百多个火温床培育红苕秧苗，保证全县40％以上的红苕在谷雨前后栽插下去。（附图片）
