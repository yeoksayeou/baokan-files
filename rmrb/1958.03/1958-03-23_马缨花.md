Silktree

“On the Pantuo River is my home, if you have time, come for tea,
Yellow earth walls, thatched roof, a silktree in front of the door.”

This poem was found in a small note in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," and I paid special attention to the words "silktree." The silktree has many names, including *hehun*, *yehe*, *qingshang*, *mengge*, and *hehuanshu* in the Compendium of Materia Medica. It is a deciduous tree that grows in the mountains and fields. This tree is at least ten feet tall and can be found in Jiangsu, Hubei, Fujian, Hebei, and other places. There are also many in Beijing. In the summer, when you walk near Qianmen Station, Wupailou, and the north gate of the Dongsi People's Market, you will be attracted by rows of pink, small, feather-fan-like flowers swaying in the wind. Those are silktrees. Because its flowers look like silk threads or velvet threads, Beijingers also call it the "velvet flower tree."

This tree is not only beautiful but also beneficial to people's health. "Nourishing Life" has the sentence "Silktree dispels anger, daylily forgets worries." *Hehuan* is the silktree. The bark of the silktree is also a very economical folk medicine called "silktree bark." It can be taken internally or used externally. Traditional Chinese medicine often prescribes silktree bark for patients with long-term depression or nervousness. It is suitable. In cases of falls, injuries, and sprains, it is also effective to apply a mixture of silktree bark powder and yellow wine externally. (Qu Zuyi)

    马缨花
    “盘沱江上是侬家，郎若闲时来吃茶，
    黄土筑墙茅盖屋，门前一树马缨花。”
    这诗是在“聊斋”的一段小注里发现的，我特别注意马缨花三个字。马缨花的名字很多，本草纲目里就有合昏、夜合、青裳、萌葛和合欢树。这是生在山野的落叶乔木。这种树，少说也有丈来高，江苏、湖北、福建、河北等地都有。北京市内也不少，当夏天你走到前门车站、五牌楼和东四人民市场北门附近，你会被一棵棵迎风摇摆着的像小羽毛扇子似的一片粉红色的小花吸引住，那就是马缨花。因为它的花，一丝丝又好像绒花线，所以北京人又管它叫“绒花树”。
    这种树不仅好看而且对人养生有益。养生论有“合欢蠲忿，萱草忘忧”的句子。合欢就是马缨花。马缨花的树皮还是很经济的一味民间药，叫“合欢皮”。它既可内服，也能外用。中医对长期忧郁不舒的老病号，或是神经质的人常在处方里来点合欢皮，是相宜的。遇到跌伤、摔伤、挫伤等，用合欢皮的粉和黄酒合起来外敷，也有效。　（曲祖贻）
