Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 16th: The Vietnam News Agency reported that the Director of the Department of Western Europe and the Americas of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam summoned the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the French General Delegation to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the afternoon of the 15th to protest the speech made by French Foreign Minister Pinau at the Manila meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. At that meeting, Pinau fabricated claims that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was expanding its army.

In a statement handed to the French Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, the Vietnamese side pointed out that Pinau's statement distorted the facts and was an unfriendly act towards the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement recalled the fact that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had reduced its army, cut defense expenditures, and repeatedly proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultations in accordance with the Geneva Accords in order to peacefully reunify Vietnam after the restoration of peace, and emphasized that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and strictly abided by the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The statement said that, on the contrary, American imperialism has transported large amounts of military personnel and materials into South Vietnam and established new armed forces there. They have turned South Vietnam into a base for military aggression, undermining the Geneva Accords and obstructing the reunification of Vietnam.

The statement accused the French government, as a signatory to the Geneva Accords, of aiding and abetting the United States' destructive activities in South Vietnam. It said that the French government participated in the military alliance of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and agreed to include South Vietnam in the "protected area" of this aggressive bloc. In addition, the French government also supported South Vietnam's accession to the United Nations. These actions clearly demonstrate that the French government has not only failed to fulfill its obligations under the Geneva Accords, but has also cooperated with the American imperialist conspiracy to permanently divide Vietnam and exacerbate tensions in Southeast Asia.

    越南外交部斥比诺造谣
    指责法美狼狈为奸破坏越南统一
    新华社河内16日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南民主共和国外交部西欧和美洲司司长在15日下午召见了法国驻越南民主共和国总代表团的临时代办，就法国外长比诺在东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议的讲话提出抗议。比诺在那次会议上曾经捏造说越南民主共和国扩充军队。
    越方在交给法国临时代办的声明中指出，比诺的声明是歪曲事实，是对越南民主共和国的不友好的举动。
    声明回述了越南民主共和国政府在和平恢复后裁减军队、削减国防费用和多次向南越当局提出按照日内瓦协议双方举行协商以和平统一越南的建议的事实，并强调，越南民主共和国政府是一贯严格履行日内瓦协议规定的。声明说，相反地，美帝国主义把大量的军事人员和军事物资运入南越，并在那里建立新的武装部队。他们已把南越变成一个军事侵略基地，破坏日内瓦协议和阻挠越南的统一。
    声明指责法国政府做为签订日内瓦协议的一方，却资助美国在南越的破坏活动，他说，法国政府参加了东南亚条约组织的军事联盟，并同意把南越划入这个侵略集团的“保护区”。另外，法国政府还支持南越加入联合国。这些行为明显地证明法国政府不仅没有履行它对日内瓦协议的义务，还同美帝国主义的阴谋活动配合，企图永远分裂越南和加剧东南亚的紧张局势。
