Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd:
The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power requires all regions across the country to immediately strengthen irrigation management and water storage, water conservation, and spring irrigation work.

On the 2nd, at a telephone conference held by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the provinces of Shaanxi, Hunan, Gansu, Guangdong, Shandong, and Hebei reported that they are taking a series of measures to strengthen this work. Hunan and Guangdong have begun storing water in newly built projects, and Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces have universally started spring irrigation for projects that can be irrigated. Farmers in northern Shaanxi and Bashang in Hebei Province have also launched a surge of carrying ice back to the fields. All provinces are training technical cadres for irrigation management and irrigation management personnel for agricultural cooperatives, establishing or consolidating irrigation management organizations at all levels, requiring all cadres leading water conservancy to have their own experimental fields to be both "red" and "expert," eliminating the phenomenon of not understanding irrigation technology, and requiring all water conservancy projects, large and small, to have management organizations or dedicated personnel for management. All provinces are launching campaigns for rational water use and against water waste. Shaanxi Province requires state-owned irrigation districts to irrigate 1,000 to 1,300 mu of land per cubic meter of water per day and night, and agricultural cooperative projects 900 to 1,500 mu.

At the meeting, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power required all regions to launch a great leap forward in irrigation management on the basis of the great leap forward in water conservancy construction, manage and use the existing 700 million mu of irrigation facilities well, and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture. Vice Minister He Jifeng said: Water conservancy work must implement the principle of attaching equal importance to construction and management, and use projects as they are built.

As some areas still do not pay enough attention to irrigation management, irrigation technology is backward, and there is water wastage, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power put forward six suggestions for strengthening this work: 1. Build one place well, manage one place well, and use one place well. All irrigation projects, large and small, must be managed. 2. Innovate irrigation technology and conserve water; comprehensively arrange irrigation water use, boldly break through old irrigation quotas, and improve water utilization; combine canals, weirs, ponds, and reservoirs for unified regulation and use; advocate rational water use and establish experimental field comparison demonstrations; oppose wasteful phenomena such as flooding and dyke breaches. 3. Projects must be built to the end, ensuring that reservoirs are completed, canals are open, and wells are level with the ground; each project must have a canal system, land must be leveled, and field ditches and furrows must be opened well; new projects must be inspected and accepted. 4. Immediately do a good job in water storage and water conservation, storing water as projects are built, which is particularly important in the south. 5. Irrigation must be combined with agricultural measures to maximize the role of water and fertilizer in increasing production. 6. Use methods such as inviting masters to mentor apprentices, organizing visits, and training to widely teach farmers techniques such as land preparation, furrowing, and irrigation.

The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power also required all regions to put in the same effort as they do in water conservancy construction to do this work well, especially the current spring irrigation; carry out competitions and comparisons between irrigation districts and between cooperatives, comparing innovation in irrigation technology, water conservation, and increased production, and strive for excellence.

Special dispatch from Taiyuan by Xinhua News Agency: After investigation and calculation, the water conservancy department of Shanxi Province has determined that as long as water is used rationally, conserved, and existing water sources are fully utilized, the province's clear water irrigation area can be expanded by more than onefold, increasing the irrigated area by 8 million to 10 million mu on the basis of existing irrigation equipment. Farmers in areas with better water conservancy conditions in Shanxi Province have always been accustomed to irrigating and watering deeply, believing that "eating two steamed buns is always better than eating one," with an irrigation volume of up to 80 to 100 cubic meters per mu, exceeding the actual water demand of crops by more than onefold. According to agricultural experts, excessive watering is not only not beneficial to crops, but also raises the groundwater level after excess water permeates into groundwater, destroys the soil structure, and causes soil salinization. At the same time, the phenomenon of water runoff and leakage is also very serious in these areas during irrigation. For example, the Sanggan River irrigation canal draws clear water from the canal head with a flow rate of 7 cubic meters per second, but after a 100-li-long canal, only 3.5 cubic meters per second of water is left. According to the inspection materials of many canals, the effective utilization coefficient of canal systems in various places is only 40%, that is, only 40% of 100 cubic meters of water is used for crops, and 60% is lost due to seepage and leakage in large and small canals and dispersion during irrigation. Well water irrigation areas also cannot fully utilize water volume due to a lack of water lifting tools and poor land leveling work. In addition, many water resources have not been utilized in various places.

After studying the above situation, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Department decided to launch a water-saving irrigation campaign in the whole province that goes hand in hand with tapping new water sources, changing the old unreasonable water rules, strengthening irrigation management, implementing planned water use, expanding the irrigated area, and ensuring spring irrigation for drought prevention and immediate benefits. In terms of irrigation technology, the plan is to change from flood irrigation to furrow irrigation, and from large furrow irrigation to small furrow irrigation. In order to implement planned water use, each irrigation district must improve its organization and implement quantitative water supply. Repair and improve canal system projects to control seepage and loss. Solve the problem of water lifting tools in well water irrigation areas.

    合理用水　多灌农田
    水利电力部召开电话会议号召加强灌溉管理
    山西开展节约用水运动，扩大灌溉面积一倍
    据新华社3日讯　水利电力部要求全国各地立即加强灌溉管理和蓄水、保水、春灌等工作。
    2日，在水利电力部举行的电话会议上，陕西、湖南、甘肃、广东、山东、河北等省报告说，各省都正在采取一系列的措施加强这个工作。湖南、广东新修工程已开始蓄水，陕西、甘肃等省能浇灌的工程已普遍开始春灌。陕北和河北省坝上的农民还展开了抬冰归田的热潮。各省都在训练灌溉管理的技术干部和农业社的灌溉管理人员，建立或整顿各级灌溉管理组织，要求一切领导水利的干部有自己的试验田，作到又红又专，消灭不懂灌溉技术的现象，要求一切大小水利工程都有管理机构或专人管理。各省都在开展合理用水和反对浪费水的运动。陕西省要求国营灌区每方水每昼夜浇地一千—一千三百亩，农业社的工程九百—一千五百亩。
    会上，水利电力部要求各地在兴修水利大跃进的基础上来一个灌溉管理大跃进，管好用好已有的七亿多亩灌溉设施，保证农业大丰收。副部长何基沣说：水利工作要贯彻修管并重的方针，随修随用。
    由于还有些地区对灌溉管理不够注意，灌溉技术落后并有浪费水的现象，水利电力部对加强这个工作提了六点意见。1、修好一处，管好一处，用好一处，所有大小灌溉工程都要管起来。2、革新灌溉技术，节约用水；全面做好灌溉用水安排，大胆突破旧有的灌溉定额，提高水的利用率；渠堰塘库联合起来统一调剂使用；提倡合理用水，建立试验田对比示范；反对大水漫灌和决口跑水等浪费水的现象。3、工程要修到底，做到库成渠通、井成地平；每一工程要有渠道系统，要平整土地和开好田间的沟畦；对新修的工程要注意检查和验收。4、立即做好蓄水保水工作，随修随蓄，特别是南方更重要。5、灌溉必须和农业措施结合，发挥水肥增产的最大作用。6、用请师傅带徒弟、组织参观、训练等办法，广泛向农民传授整地打畦灌溉等技术。
    水利电力部还要求各地拿出兴修水利的劲头来搞好这一工作，特别是当前的春灌；开展灌区与灌区、社与社之间的竞赛评比，比灌溉技术的革新，比省水和增产，力争上游。
    本报特约新华社太原专电　山西省水利部门根据调查计算，在现有灌溉设备的基础上，只要合理用水，节约用水，充分利用现有水源，就能使全省的清水灌溉面积扩大一倍以上，增加八百万亩到一千万亩灌溉面积。山西省水利条件较好地区的农民，历来就习惯多灌深浇，认为“吃一个馒头总不如吃两个好”，一亩地浇水量多至八十到一百公方，超过了农作物实际需水量一倍以上。据农业专家谈，过多地浇水不仅对农作物没有好处，把多余的水渗透成地下水以后，会提高地下水位，破坏土壤结构，造成土地盐碱化。同时，这些地区在浇地时跑水、漏水的现象也很严重。例如桑干河灌渠，从渠首引清水，流量是七秒公方，经过一百里长的渠道，只留下三点五秒公方的水量。据不少渠道的检查材料表明，各地渠系有效利用系数只达40％，就是说一百公方水，只有四成用于农作物，六成经过大小渠道时渗漏掉和灌溉时流散掉。井水灌区由于缺乏提水工具和平整土地工作较差，也不能充分利用水量。另外，各地有许多水还没有得到利用。
    山西省水利部门研究了上述情况后，决定在全省范围内开展一个与开源并进的节约灌溉用水运动，改变旧的不合理的水规、加强灌溉管理，实行计划用水，扩大浇地面积，保证春浇防旱、当年得利。在灌溉技术上要变大水漫灌为畦浇，变大畦浇为小畦浇。为了贯彻计划用水的作法，各灌区要健全组织，实行定量供水。整修和健全渠系工程，节制渗漏损耗。在井水灌区解决提水工具问题。
