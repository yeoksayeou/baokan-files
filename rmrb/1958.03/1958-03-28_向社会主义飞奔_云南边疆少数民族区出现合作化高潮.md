Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Dispatch—In the minority areas of Yunnan's border regions, where land reform was completed through peaceful consultation, a high tide of cooperativization has emerged in some areas after more than two years of mutual aid and cooperation. It is expected that cooperativization can be realized after another two years of great leap forward.

The border region of Yunnan, with a population of 1.5 million, had entered feudal society at the time of liberation. After these areas successively completed land reform through peaceful consultation between 1955 and 1956, the Party immediately led the people of all ethnic groups to advance towards socialism through the road of cooperativization. However, the level of production and socio-economic conditions in the border areas differ greatly from those in the inland areas, and the living customs, religious culture, etc. of each ethnic group are also different. Therefore, when formulating the speed, scale, form, and working methods of cooperativization in the border areas, the Party also fully considered the characteristics of each ethnic group. Generally, it follows the development law of "from small to large, from less to more, from low-level to high-level" and adopts more prudent but active steps than the cooperativization in the inland areas. In the process of cooperativization, the Party also promptly corrected the "left" and right-leaning deviations of some cadres who were eager for quick results or shrinking back, as well as the practice of separating the development of production and cooperativization, thus leading the cooperativization onto a healthy development path. By the end of last year, 2,077 elementary agricultural cooperatives had been established, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 21.9% of the total households in these areas. Due to the differences in the work foundation and the timing of completing land reform, the speed of cooperativization varies from place to place. It can be roughly divided into three types: Hekou, Zhenkang, Daxueshan and other counties (districts) that completed land reform earlier and have a larger Han population have basically realized elementary cooperativization; some counties in the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Jiangcheng Hani-Yi Autonomous County and Shuangjiang County, where land reform was completed slightly later and the work foundation is better, have cooperatives in every township or village, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 30% to 50% or more of the total peasant households; Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the four border counties of Honghe Hani-Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region, Gengma Dai-Kawa Autonomous County, and Menglian Dai-Lahu-Kawa Autonomous Region, where land reform was completed the latest, only carry out pilot cooperatives in some districts and townships.

Regardless of the type of cooperative, they have all shown unparalleled superiority in their own ethnic groups. Last year, more than 90% of these 2,000+ cooperatives increased production, generally by 20% to 30%, and at most by 100%, and 90% of the cooperative members increased their income. Due to the great production potential in the border areas, many cooperatives have surpassed the production and living standards of local well-to-do middle peasants within two years of their establishment, and most cooperatives are striving to catch up with or exceed the level of well-to-do middle peasants in about three years. Now, establishing cooperatives has become an urgent demand of the broad masses. Some poor and lower-middle peasants have repeatedly asked cadres and leaders to establish cooperatives for their whole families, and some areas produce during the day and establish cooperatives at night. In Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Jiangcheng Hani-Yi Autonomous County, Shuangjiang County, and other places, the trend is rising, responding to every call, and the high tide of cooperativization has become a natural result. In Shuangjiang County, within twenty days after February 10th, 231 cooperatives were established, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the county has jumped from 31.5% at the end of last year to 70%, basically realizing elementary cooperativization.

### 向社会主义飞奔  云南边疆少数民族区出现合作化高潮

    向社会主义飞奔
    云南边疆少数民族区出现合作化高潮
    本报特约新华社昆明电  云南边疆采用和平协商方式完成土地改革的少数民族地区，经过两年多互助合作的发展，目前已在部分地区出现合作化高潮。预计再经两年的跃进，即可实现合作化。
    云南边境拥有一百五十万人的地区在解放时已进入封建社会。这些地区在1955年到1956年间先后完成和平协商土地改革以后，党立即领导各族人民通过合作化的道路，向社会主义前进。但是，边疆地区的生产水平和社会经济条件都与内地差别很大，各民族的生活习俗，宗教文化等也各不相同。因此，党在制订边疆地区合作化的速度、规模、形式和工作方法时，也充分考虑到各民族的特点。一般都遵循“从小到大、从少到多、从低级到高级”的发展规律，采取了比内地合作化更为稳健、但是积极的步骤。在合作化过程中，党并及时纠正了部分干部中急于求成和畏缩不前的“左”右摇摆偏向，以及把发展生产和合作化分开孤立进行的作法，从而把合作化引上健康的发展道路。到去年底，已经建立了二千零七十七个初级农业社，入社农户占这些地区总户数的21.9％。由于工作基础和完成土地改革先后之不同，各地合作化的速度也有差异。大致可分为三种类型：结束土地改革较早、汉族居民较多的河口、镇康、大雪山等县（区），已基本实现了初级合作化；土地改革完成稍迟、工作基础较好的德宏傣族景颇族自治州的一部分县，江城哈尼族彝族自治县和双江县已经乡乡有社或村村有社，入社农户分别占总农户的30％至50％以上；土地改革结束最迟的西双版纳傣族自治州、红河哈尼族彝族自治州边疆四县、澜沧拉祜族自治区、耿马傣族佧佤族自治县以及孟连具傣族拉祜族佧佤族自治区，只在部分的区乡试点办社。
    不管哪一种类型地区的合作社，都在自己民族中显示出了无比的优越性。去年，这两千多个合作社有90％以上增了产，一般增产两成到三成，最多增产一倍，社员中有90％增加了收入。由于边疆生产潜力很大，有不少合作社成立两年就超过了当地富裕中农的生产生活水平，大多数社都争取在三年左右赶上或超过富裕中农水平。现在办社已成为广大群众的迫切要求，有的贫农和下中农全家几次要求干部领导办社，有的地区白天生产，晚上办社。德宏傣族景颇族自治州，江城哈尼族彝族自治县和双江县等地，更是风起云涌，一呼百应，合作化高潮已成为水到渠成之势。双江县从2月10日以后的二十天内，办起了二百三十一个社，全县入社农户已由去年年底的31.5％跃进为70％，基本实现了初级合作化。
