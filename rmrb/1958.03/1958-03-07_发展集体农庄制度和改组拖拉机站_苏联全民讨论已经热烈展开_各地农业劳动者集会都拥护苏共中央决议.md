    Developing the Collective Farm System and Reorganizing Tractor Stations
    National Discussion in the Soviet Union is in Full Swing
    Agricultural Laborers in Various Regions Hold Rallies to Support the Resolution of the CPSU Central Committee
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The national discussion regarding the further development of the collective farm system and the reorganization of machine tractor stations has already begun in the Soviet Union.
    The resolution of the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) regarding this issue spread rapidly throughout the Soviet Union. Especially in rural areas, the news flew to every household as if it had wings. Agricultural laborers greeted this decision of the CPSU Central Committee with joy and enthusiasm, considering it timely and wise. Workers in industrial enterprises across the country also held rallies to support this decision. Many factories have decided to provide regular and obligatory technical assistance to fixed collective farms. For example, the Kiev Locomotive Repair Factory decided to help several nearby collective farms repair their machines. The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) also passed a resolution calling on Komsomol members and youth across the country to actively participate in this major discussion.
    Many collective farms have already decided during the discussion to prepare to purchase tractors. For example, 178 collective farms in the Stavropol Krai have made decisions to purchase machines. Some collective farms have even discussed how many machines to buy and how much money they will need.
    Many collective farms have used their own experience and precise calculations in the discussions to illustrate the benefits of concentrating land and machinery in the hands of one owner. The chairman of the "Eastern Light" collective farm in Almaty Oblast, Kazakhstan, said that if the collective farm controls the machines itself, it will use them more fully and better. For example, their farm's work was originally cultivated by tractor stations using 35 tractors; if the farm uses its own machines, only 28 would be enough. Some collective farms in the Latvian Republic have also used their actual experience in the trial implementation to prove the correctness of the CPSU Central Committee's resolution. For example, the "Vanguard" collective farm has a team of tractors under its own command and use. For more than a year, this team of tractors has been directly led by the farm's work team leader, which has reduced one tractor team leader and one work recorder, saving 40,000 rubles in wages alone. The tractor's work plan has also been overfulfilled. Now the collective farm has decided to immediately buy this team of tractors first.

    发展集体农庄制度和改组拖拉机站
    苏联全民讨论已经热烈展开
    各地农业劳动者集会都拥护苏共中央决议
    本报讯　关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的问题，苏联全民讨论已经开始了。
    苏联共产党中央委员会二月全会关于这一问题的决议，迅速地传遍苏联全国各地。特别是在农村中，这个消息简直像长了翅膀一样飞到了家家户户。农业劳动者怀着喜悦的心情热烈欢迎苏共中央的这一决定，认为它是及时而英明的。全国各地工业企业的工人们也纷纷举行集会，拥护这一决定。许多工厂并决定对固定的农庄进行经常的义务技术援助。例如，基辅机车修配厂就决定帮助附近几个农庄修理机器。苏联共青团中央委员会也通过决定，号召全国共青团员和青年积极参加这一重大的讨论。
    许多农庄已经在讨论时决定准备购买拖拉机。例如，斯塔甫罗波里边疆区已有一百七十八个集体农庄作出了购买机器的决定。有的农庄甚至把买多少架机器，需要多少钱等问题都讨论过了。
    许多农庄在讨论中都用自己的经验，用精确的计算数字，说明土地和机器集中在一个主人手中的好处。哈萨克共和国阿拉木图州“东方之光”农庄主席说，农庄自己掌握了机器，会把机器利用得更充分，更好。例如他们农庄的活儿，原来拖拉机站用三十五部拖拉机耕作，如果农庄用自己的机器，只需二十八部就够了。拉脱维亚共和国的一些农庄也以自己在试行中的实际经验证明了苏共中央决议的正确。例如，“先锋”集体农庄有一队归自己指挥和使用的拖拉机，一年多来，这队拖拉机由农庄的工作队长直接领导，这样就减少了一个拖拉机队队长和一个计工员。只工资一项就节约了四万卢布。拖拉机的工作计划也超额完成了。现在农庄已决定立即先把这一队拖拉机买下来。
