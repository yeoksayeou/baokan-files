Red Flowers Bloom in Every Household

    These days, in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities, the rectification movement among street residents is reaching a climax. This is truly gratifying. What's gratifying is that the socialist democratic movement is truly penetrating everywhere. The situation of the great leap forward in the revolution is appearing in every corner. Factories, rural areas, government offices, organizations... are all competing to be advanced, catch up with speed, and leap forward a thousand miles a day. Now, street residents and housewives are catching up too.
    Look at the streets and alleys, the walls of the lanes, overnight, big-character posters are dazzling to the eye. In addition to big-character posters, there are group meetings, courtyard meetings, bedside meetings, suggestion boxes, suggestion books, reception stations, and mobile stations. The content is even richer and more vivid, involving all aspects of daily life, with people and events, specific and sharp, and most of it is sincere and touching. Sitting in on a street residents' airing-of-views meeting is like a family sitting down for a heart-to-heart talk. From national affairs to firewood, rice, oil, and salt, from the work style of cadres to the service attitude of retail stores, nothing is left unsaid. People meeting each other in the front street and back yard, left and right neighbors, no longer say "Today's weather, ha ha ha," no longer ask: "Have you eaten?" but rather: "How many big-character posters have you written?" "What opinions have you raised?" Wherever you go, you can feel people's patriotic, Party-loving, cadre-protecting enthusiasm and the glorious sense of responsibility of being masters of their own affairs.
    However, in the airing-of-views meetings, there are also a few residents who sit aside, silent, or hold back half of what they want to say, not speaking freely, with a very detached attitude. When asked why, they say: "We housewives have shallow vision, what do we know about national affairs?" "Asking us to make suggestions is nothing more than trivial matters of firewood, rice, oil, and salt, what's the use of making them?" "If suggestions are made but can't be changed, wouldn't it be a waste of time!"
    Speaking of these things, I often think of the "Do not discuss state affairs" signs posted in teahouses and restaurants in the old society. It was like a seal, sealing people's mouths, forcing them to keep their anger bottled up inside. The reactionary rulers practiced the philosophy of "The people can be made to follow a path, but cannot be made to understand it," they "preventing the people's mouths is more important than preventing rivers," how could they let the common people talk about their feelings freely? Now, things have turned around, the Party and the government are doing everything possible to teach the people to talk about state affairs, which is why they launched the nationwide rectification movement. Because it is the people who are in charge. Since they are the masters, how can they not care about the affairs of the country! Many important policies of the Party and the government must be implemented among street residents, and street residents have the most specific understanding and the deepest feelings about the various shortcomings in work and the work style of cadres. Therefore, making suggestions on work and making suggestions on cadres is both a responsibility and a right. Since we are all one family, why not say what's in our hearts frankly? Yes, firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea, water, electricity, as well as the stiff service attitude of stores, the unsanitary vegetables in the vegetable stalls, etc., may seem like small things, but they are of great importance to the daily lives of the people. It is precisely from these subtle things that we can best see the relationship between cadres and the masses, and best test whether our work is done well or badly.
    Some people doubt, can all the many opinions raised by residents be changed? This concern is unnecessary. Let me give a few examples: According to incomplete statistics from six districts in Beijing, by March 12, more than 106,000 of the more than 320,000 opinions raised by residents had been rectified; a large number of cadres from district-level organs in Shanghai went out of their offices and went deep into the lanes to implement on-the-spot rectification, and many grain stores delivered rice to people's homes, eliminating the queuing phenomenon; residents in Tianjin submitted 170,000 opinions to the street offices and public security police stations, and more than 80% of them have been resolved. The heads and cadres of many units publicly examined their shortcomings and errors to the residents, formulated improvement plans, and strived for mass supervision. Everywhere is changing for the better from morning to evening, and what is said is done. In many places, a new style of harmony in every family, happiness for everyone, and close unity between residents and cadres has begun to appear. What else can skeptics say!
    The surging tide of socialist democracy has already surged to the doorsteps of every household. Responsibility and rights have been delivered to your doorsteps at the same time. Let every resident take on the responsibility of managing national affairs and exercise the right to criticism and self-criticism!

    家家户户红花开

    这几天，在北京、上海和其他一些城市里，街道居民的整风运动正在形成高潮。这真叫人高兴。高兴的是，社会主义的民主运动，真的是无孔不入了。革命大跃进的形势，出现在每个角落里。工厂、农村、机关、团体……都在比先进、赶速度、一日千里地跃进。如今，街道居民、家庭主妇们也赶上来了。
    且看大街小巷、里弄墙头，一夜之间大字报琳琅满目。除了大字报，还有片会、院会、炕头会、意见箱、意见簿、接待站、流动站。内容更是丰富生动，涉及日常生活的各个方面，有人有事、具体尖锐，大部分诚恳感人。坐在街道居民的鸣放会上，就像是一家人坐着谈心。从国家大事到柴米油盐，从干部作风到零售店的服务态度，无话不谈。前街后院、左邻右舍，人们见面不再是“今天天气哈哈哈”，不再问：“你吃饭了吗？”而是：“你写了多少大字报？”“你提了些什么意见？”到哪里，你都能感觉到人们的一片爱国、爱党、爱护干部的热心和主人翁的光荣感和责任感。
    但是，在鸣放会上，也有少数居民坐在一旁，沉默不语，或者话到嘴边留半句，不是畅所欲言，很有一番事不关己的味道。问起为什么？她们就说：“我们家庭妇女眼光浅，知道什么国家大事？”“叫俺提意见，无非是些柴米油盐的琐事，提了有啥用。”“提了不能改，还不是白提！”
    说起这些，我常常想到在旧社会茶馆、饭铺里张贴着“莫谈国事”的纸条。它像封条一样，封住了人们的嘴，有气只能闷在心里。反动统治者奉行“民可使由之，不可使知之”的哲学，他们“防民之口，甚于防川”，哪里能让老百姓畅谈心事？如今，事情倒转过来，党和政府想尽一切办法教人民谈国事，因此才开展全民整风运动。因为当家作主的是人民。既然是主人，哪能不管国家的事！党和政府的很多重要政策，都要贯彻到街道居民中去，街道居民对工作和干部作风上的各种毛病，了解得最具体，感受得也最深刻，因此，对工作提意见，对干部提意见，这是责任，也是权利。既是一家人，心里有什么话，为什么不说个痛快呢？是的，柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶、水、电，以及商店的服务态度生硬、菜摊的菜不卫生等等，看来都是小事，但是它们却和人民群众的日常生活有着重大关系。也正是从这些细微的事情上，最能看出干部和人民群众的关系，最能测验出我们的工作做得是好是坏。
    有人怀疑，居民提了那么多意见，都能改掉吗？这顾虑是不必要的。且举几个例子：北京市据六个区的不完全统计，到3月12日，对居民提出的三十二万多条意见，已经整改了十万六千多条；上海市区级机关，大批干部走出办公室、深入里弄，实行现场整改，许多粮店送米上门，消除排队现象；天津居民给街办事处和公安派出所提出十七万条意见，80％以上已经解决，许多单位的负责人和干部向居民公开检查自己的缺点和错误，订出改进方案，争取群众监督。处处都是朝闻夕改，说到做到。在许多地方，已经开始出现了家家和睦、人人舒畅、居民和干部亲密团结的新风尚，怀疑论者还有什么可说！
    汹涌澎湃的社会主义民主浪潮，已经涌到家家户户的大门口来了。责任和权利，同时送到了门前，每个居民都担起管理国家大事的责任，使用起批评和自我批评的权利吧！
