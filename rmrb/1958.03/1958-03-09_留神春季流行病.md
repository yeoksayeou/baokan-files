    Beware of Spring Epidemics

    There are infectious diseases in all seasons, but especially in spring. The reasons, I think, are firstly because spring is the season of growth for all things, and germs and viruses inevitably take the opportunity to multiply rapidly; and secondly, because the weather in spring is erratic, and people's resistance is reduced.

    The infectious diseases prevalent in spring include influenza, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, epidemic parotitis, lobar pneumonia, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, smallpox, measles, etc. Some of these may have started to spread in the previous winter, but they often peak in spring. Most of the patients are children, because children have weak resistance, but adults are often not spared. Some diseases, such as lobar pneumonia, mainly target young adults.

    These infectious diseases are mostly extremely vicious, and each has had rampant years of slaughtering humans in history. For example, influenza has had several large-scale global epidemics. Just take the major epidemic of 1918, which originated in France, invaded Britain westward, affected the Americas, and extended eastward through Germany, Italy, and other countries to Asia and Australia. For a time, almost half of the world's population was infected, and about 15 million people died. Another example is epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, although the scale of the epidemic is not large, it is frequent and widespread in various countries: it was prevalent in France from 1837 to 1850, and in Britain from 1854 to 1903. Since 1900, it has also been prevalent in many parts of China, but now it is much less common. Smallpox, for example, also originated in foreign countries, but it has been particularly harmful to the Chinese people. As early as 300 years BC, there were records of this disease in China. After the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, almost everyone could not avoid this disease. By 1938, the epidemic was most severe in the Shanghai area, with at least one in every hundred people contracting the disease. However, after the People's Government vigorously promoted vaccination, many areas across the country have not seen a single case of smallpox to this day.

    Judging from the fact that smallpox is about to disappear in China, as long as the principle and practice of "prevention first" are implemented, these infectious diseases can be prevented. In fact, we should actively prevent any disease, even those that we are fully confident of curing after they occur. Because once the disease occurs, people's health and work will be affected first. Ancient Chinese physicians have long drawn rich experience from the long-term struggle against diseases, and the earliest Chinese medical book "Huangdi Neijing" made a very appropriate analogy, saying that treating diseases with medicine after they occur is like digging a well when you are thirsty or manufacturing weapons after you have started fighting with the enemy, it is too late (general idea)! However, the full attention and establishment of preventive medicine was only possible in socialist society. After liberation, China, like the Soviet Union, vigorously promoted "prevention first," and diseases have been greatly reduced. Many infectious diseases are close to being eliminated or are being eliminated. However, in Britain, where the cowpox vaccination was first invented, and France, which produced the famous modern immunology master, there are still sequelae of smallpox. This is not difficult to understand. Hospitals and doctors in capitalist countries, which are mainly focused on making money, are afraid that people will not get sick, so how can they ask people to prevent it in advance?

    To prevent the spread of these infectious diseases, taking some preventive medicines and getting some vaccinations are certainly a solution. However, there are still no specific medicines for the treatment of some diseases, let alone taking them for prevention; although there are preventive medicines for some diseases, most of them are not very effective or do not last long. Therefore, we cannot completely rely on drugs. In the long run, in addition to daily physical exercise and paying attention to environmental and personal hygiene, we must also actively block the spread of these diseases (mainly respiratory and contact transmission). Therefore, we must do the following:
  (1) Wear masks in crowded places. A qualified (six layers of gauze, disinfected) and standardly worn mask can block more than 95% of germs. People with respiratory discomfort (such as coughing) should consciously wear masks to avoid harming themselves and others.
  (2) Do not spit or blow your nose anywhere.
  (3) Regularly ventilate the room.
  (4) If an infectious disease patient is found, they should be isolated immediately. The place where the patient stayed should be disinfected in a timely and strict manner. People who have been in contact with the patient should immediately go to the doctor for examination.

### 留神春季流行病

    留神春季流行病
    一年四季都有传染病，春天尤其多。这原因，我想一是由于春天是万物生长的季节，病菌、病毒也不免乘机迅速繁殖起来；二是春天忽冷忽热，人们抵抗力降低了的缘故。
    春天流行的传染病，有流行性感冒、流行性脑脊髓膜炎、流行性腮腺炎、大叶性肺炎、猩红热、白喉、百日咳、天花、麻疹等等。其中有些也许在上年冬天就开始流行了，但往往到春天最盛。患病的人，孩子占多数，因为孩子抵抗力弱，但大人也常常不能幸免。有些病如大叶性肺炎，矛头主要指向青壮年。
    这些传染病大都穷凶极恶，在历史上各自有过屠杀人类的猖獗年代。例如流行性感冒，有过多次大规模的世界性流行。单说1918年那次大流行，从法国发生，西侵英国，波及美洲，东经德、意诸国，扩展到亚、澳两洲。一时，世界人口几乎半数受到感染，死亡了大约一千五百万人。又如流行性脑脊髓膜炎，流行规模虽不算大，却频繁而遍及世界各国：1837到1850年在法国流行，1854到1903年在英国流行。1900年以来，我国不少地方也曾流行，现在才少多了。再如天花，也发源于外国，但对我国人民的危害特别深。早在公元三百年前，我国就有了这病的记载。元明以后，几乎人人都难免这病。到1938年，上海一带流行得最厉害，平均一百人中至少有一人得这病。但在解放后，经过人民政府大力推广接种牛痘，全国很多地区至今不曾出现过一个天花病人。
    由天花即将在我国绝迹的事实看，只要贯彻“预防为主”的方针和作法，这些传染病都是可以预防的。其实对任何疾病都应积极预防，即使是发生后完全有把握医好的疾病，也应该这样。因为病一发生，人的健康和工作先就受到了损失。我国古代医学家从长期同疾病斗争中早就得出了“防患于未然”的丰富经验，我国最早的医书“黄帝内经”里作了很恰切的比喻，说病了才去用药治，就好像口渴了才去掘井或是已同敌人开了仗才去制造武器一样，来不及了（大意）！然而，预防医学的被充分重视和建立起来，是一直到也只有到社会主义社会才可能。我国在解放后就同苏联一样，大力提倡“预防为主”，疾病大大减少，许多传染病都已接近消灭或正在设法消灭中。而在首先发明牛痘的英国和出过著名的近代免疫学大师的法国，却至今还有天花遗留症。这是不难理解的，以赚钱为主的资本主义国家的医院和医生，唯恐人不病，怎肯叫人民事先预防呢？
    要预防这些传染病的流行，吃一些预防药、打一些预防针，固然是一个办法。但是，有些病在治疗上至今还没有特效药，更无从服用以预防；有些病虽然有预防药，却大都药效不大或维持时间不长。所以，不能完全指望药物。长久之计，除了日常坚持锻炼身体，以及注重环境卫生和个人卫生外，还要积极堵塞这些病的传播途径（主要是呼吸道传染和接触传染），因此要做到以下几点：
  （一）人多的地方要戴口罩。一个合格（六层纱布，消毒）和戴得标准的口罩，可以挡住95％以上的病菌。呼吸道不舒服的人（如咳嗽），更要自觉戴口罩，以免自误误人。
  （二）不能随地吐痰和擤鼻涕。
  （三）居室要经常开窗通风。（四）发现传染病人，应立即隔离。病人停留过的地方，要及时严密消毒。接触过病人的人，要立时去医生处检查。
