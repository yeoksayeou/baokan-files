    Twenty Years Beside the Steel Furnace
    Li Zhongjun, a labor model and Communist Party member from Anshan City, is now forty-eight years old. He came to Anshan at the age of twenty-four and has lived beside the steel furnace for a full twenty years.

    Li Zhongjun is the leader of the furnace front work group at No. 8 Steel Furnace. Their group overfulfilled the first Five-Year Plan and has now set guarantee conditions for completing the second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, determined to ensure that our country's steel production catches up with Britain's as soon as possible.
