Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 26th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, at a meeting late on March 25th, passed a statement regarding the holding of a Disarmament and International Cooperation Conference, inviting representatives from all who seek to establish world peace to participate in the conference. The conference is scheduled to be held in Stockholm from July 16th to 22nd. The full text of the statement is as follows:

In a world composed of countries with different social and political systems, the people of all countries must find paths to harmony, as well as methods for peaceful coexistence and cooperation.

A short time ago, thousands of scientists in many countries issued a solemn warning to the world, explaining the destructive effects of nuclear explosion tests and the terrible consequences of nuclear war. This warning of theirs proves that the fears and protests of the people of all countries are justified, and the reason why the people of all countries feel fear and raise protests is because the stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen bombs is increasing daily, the stockpiles are becoming larger and larger, the number of countries storing them is also increasing, and aircraft carrying these terrible weapons are now constantly flying over many regions of the world.

World public opinion must promote the reaching of an agreement to eliminate this danger.

The pressure of the people of all countries is gradually causing relations between countries based on independence, self-determination, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, and equal rights for all, to replace relations based on force, colonial oppression, the exploitation of the natural wealth of weak countries by strong countries, and the racial discrimination produced by the spirit of domination. World public opinion can help accelerate this process.

The situation of division into military blocs, which deepens suspicion and hostility and increases the danger of war, is being opposed by the growing number of people in all countries. Suggestions regarding the signing of mutual non-aggression treaties between countries in opposing blocs, and regarding the participation of neutral countries in summit conferences, suggestions regarding the establishment of nuclear-free zones in Europe and Asia, the fact that the governments of certain countries refuse to participate in any blocs, the fact that the governments of other countries refuse to make their territories available for the further development of nuclear weapons – these examples, taken from extremely different regions of the world, clearly show that there is hope for pursuing different policies.

World public opinion can encourage the governments of all countries to abandon bloc politics together, and replace them with a unified security system.

The inflation of military budgets, the imposition of political restrictions on freedom of trade, and the improper use of science and labor to benefit the arms industry – all of these hinder the improvement of living standards and deepen poverty.

World public opinion can help the governments of all countries to seek ways of economic cooperation for the benefit of all their people.

The forces of peace are constantly growing in number and strength everywhere. People all over the world are adopting an attitude of opposition to new dangers. Not only is the number of people actively participating in peace activities increasing, but they are also prepared to work together to make their activities more effective.

The Stockholm Conference can eliminate many misunderstandings, because it will enable people of good faith from all countries to conduct frank discussions. Everyone is welcome to participate in the conference, and participation in the conference does not necessarily entail any obligations. There will be no restrictions on those attending the conference.

The people of all countries are eager for the holding of a summit conference to open the door to improving international relations and reaching international agreements. Therefore, they should make their own "summit conference" on disarmament and international cooperation a success.

The happiness of everyone, the fruits of peaceful labor, and the great ideological works that enrich and connect human civilization can only develop in an environment of freedom and peace.

    世界和平理事会常委会发表声明
    裁军和国际合作大会敞开大门
    邀请一切想要建立世界和平的人派代表参加
    新华社新德里26日电　世界和平理事会常务委员会会议在3月25日深夜通过了关于举行裁军和国际合作大会的声明，邀请一切想要建立世界和平的人派遣代表参加大会。大会定于7月16日到22日在斯德哥尔摩举行。声明的全文如下：
    在一个由具有不同社会和政治制度的国家组成的世界上，各国人民必须寻找通向和睦的道路，以及和平共处和合作的方法。
    许多国家的成千的科学家不久以前向全世界提出了庄严的警告，说明了核爆炸试验的破坏影响和核战争的可怕后果。他们这种警告证明了各国人民的恐惧和抗议是正当的，而各国人民所以感到恐惧和提出抗议，是由于原子弹和氢弹的储存日益增加，储存量越来越大，储存的国家也越来越多，而且载着这种可怕武器的飞机现在不停地在世界许多地区上空飞行。
    世界舆论必须促成为消除这种危险达成协议。
    各国人民的压力正在逐渐地使建立在独立、自决、互不干涉内政和大家权利平等的基础上的国与国的关系，来代替建立在武力、殖民压迫、强国压榨弱国的天然财富和统治精神产生的种族歧视的基础上的关系。世界舆论可以帮助加速这个过程。
    划分为军事集团的局面，加深了猜忌和敌意，增加了战争危险，这种局面正在遭到各国人民日益增长的反对。关于敌对集团国家签订互不侵犯条约和关于中立国家参加最高级会议的建议，关于在欧洲和亚洲建立无原子区的建议，某些国家的政府拒绝参加任何集团的事实，另外一些国家的政府拒绝把它们的领土拿来供进一步发展核武器之用的事实——这些从世界极不相同的地区取来的例子，清楚地说明是有希望奉行不同政策的。
    世界舆论可以鼓励各国政府一道放弃集团政策，而代之以统一的安全体系。
    使军事预算膨胀，对贸易自由施加政治限制、不正当地把科学和劳动利用来为军火工业谋利——这一切都妨碍了生活水平的提高，并且使贫困现象加深。
    世界舆论能够帮助各国政府为大家寻求经济合作的途径，来为它们的全体人民谋利。
    各地的和平力量在数量上和实力上正在不断增长。世界各地人民都在采取反对新的危险的态度。不仅积极参加和平活动的人数在增加，同时他们还准备共同努力，使他们的活动更加有效。
    斯德哥尔摩大会能够消除许多误会，因为它将使各国有诚意的人们能够坦率地进行讨论。欢迎大家参加会议，参加会议并不一定要承担义务。参加大会的人将不会受到任何限制。
    各国人民渴望召开最高级会议，为改善国际关系和达成国际协议打开大门。因此他们应该使他们自己的讨论裁军和国际合作的“最高级会议”取得成功。
    每个人的幸福、和平劳动的果实以及丰富和联系人类文明的伟大思想著作，只有在自由与和平的环境中才能发展。
