Shanghai to Build Integrated Iron and Steel Enterprise

(Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai’s first integrated iron and steel industrial enterprise will begin construction next month. This integrated enterprise, covering nearly a thousand mu and boasting more than a dozen huge workshops, is an expansion based on the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1. Upon completion, it will produce 600,000 tons of steel annually, equivalent to the current total steel production of Shanghai; an increase of 55% over the city's current steel output.

This integrated enterprise will construct a blast furnace with an annual output of 500,000 tons of pig iron, steelmaking converter workshops and open-hearth furnace workshops, continuous casting equipment to reduce costs, a blooming mill with an annual output of 400,000 tons, a seamless steel pipe workshop equivalent to one-third of the output of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant, a strip steel workshop, and a welded steel pipe workshop with an annual output of 20,000 tons. Among them, the 20,000 tons of seamless steel pipes produced annually can meet the current needs of industries such as Shanghai's shipyards, chemical plants, nitrogen fertilizer plants, boiler factories, and refrigeration plants. After the completion of this integrated enterprise, a portion of the pig iron needed by Shanghai's steelmaking industry will no longer need to be transported from places like Anshan and Ma'anshan; moreover, because the steel ingots from the steelmaking furnace are directly processed into billets within the factory, transportation costs can be greatly reduced, and the cost per ton of steel can be reduced by about one-fifth.

    上海兴建钢铁联合企业
    本报讯　上海市第一个钢铁工业联合企业，下月动工兴建。这个占地近千亩、拥有十多个巨大车间的联合企业，是在上海钢铁一厂的基础上扩建的。建成后，年产六十万吨钢，等于目前上海炼钢工业的总产量；比目前全市炼钢量增加55％。
    这个联合企业将建造起年产五十万吨生铁料的高炉，炼钢的转炉车间和平炉车间，降低成本的连续铸锭设备，年产四十万吨的开坯车间，相当于鞍山无缝钢管厂三分之一产量的无缝钢管车间，带钢车间以及年产二万吨的有缝钢管车间等。其中，年产二万吨的无缝钢管，可以满足当前上海的造船厂、化工厂、氮肥厂、锅炉厂和冷藏厂等行业的需要。这个联合企业建成后，上海炼钢工业所需要的一部分生铁料，可以不再从鞍山和马鞍山等地运来；而且由于炼钢炉里下来的钢锭直接在厂内开坯加工，可以大大减少运输费用，每吨钢的成本能降低五分之一左右。
