Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: According to a TASS report on March 6th:  Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, stated in a reply letter to Mrs. Joseph, Secretary of the Committee for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Twickenham (in Middlesex County), England, that the leaders of various countries could reach an agreement on banning nuclear weapon tests without any difficulty.

Khrushchev's reply letter was published in the March issue of the "International Life" magazine published in Moscow.

Khrushchev wrote that the Soviet government proposed studying the issue of banning nuclear weapon tests at a meeting of leaders of various countries with the participation of heads of government. The Soviet Union has already agreed to stop testing immediately. Now it is time for the British and American governments to express their attitudes.

Khrushchev said that we believe that reaching an agreement on the issue of supervision would not be very difficult either, because from the perspective of modern science, such supervision is entirely feasible and can guarantee the implementation of the agreement to stop testing.

Khrushchev emphasized that stopping nuclear weapon tests could become an important link in a series of measures; implementing these measures would lead to stopping the arms race, establishing necessary trust between countries, and eliminating the danger of a new war. A high-level meeting should play a good role in this regard.

In his reply letter, Khrushchev wrote that the Soviet people understand the anxiety of the British people about the manufacture of new types of nuclear weapons. He pointed out that this anxiety is further deepened by the fact that bombers carrying atomic bombs are circling over Britain day and night, and by the preparation to set up rocket launch sites with thermonuclear warheads on the British Isles.

Khrushchev pointed out that if the British government turns its territory into a rocket weapons base pointed at the Soviet Union, at the peaceful residents of the Soviet Union, then what is before us is not a plan for an ordinary war.  Speaking to this point, Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union must take preventive measures when necessary to prevent the threat of destruction to peaceful Soviet cities, which is: "We will also have to install rockets with atomic and hydrogen warheads to avoid being caught off guard."  Khrushchev wrote that if the Soviet Union suffers huge losses due to an attack, then a devastating counterattack will bring even more serious consequences to the British Isles.

He pointed out that if the people of all countries demand that their governments resolve ripe international issues through peaceful means, end the "Cold War," and develop cultural, trade, and other ties between people of all countries, then the danger of war can be prevented, and trust between people of all countries will be strengthened. Khrushchev reiterated that a high-level meeting would be an important step in reaching this point.

    赫鲁晓夫谈停止核试验
    条件成熟  就看美英
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社6日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在给英国特威肯南市（在半德尔塞克斯郡）禁止核武器委员会秘书约瑟夫夫人的复信中说：各国领导人可以毫无困难地达成停止核武器试验的协议。
    赫鲁晓夫的复信发表在莫斯科出版的“国际生活”杂志3月号上。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，苏联政府建议在有政府首脑参加的各国领导人会议上研究禁止试验核武器的问题。苏联已经同意立即停止试验。现在该是英国和美国政府表示态度的时候了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，在监督的问题上达成协议也不会有很大困难，因为从现代科学水平看来，这种监督是完全可以实现的事情，它可以保证停止试验协议的执行。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，停止核武器试验可能成为这样一连串措施的重要环节；实现这些措施将会导致停止军备竞赛、建立各国之间必要的信任和消除新战争危险。而举行高级会议应该在这方面起良好的作用。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中写道，苏联人理解英国人对制造新式核武器感到不安的心情。他指出，由于载着原子弹的轰炸机昼夜不停地在英国上空盘旋，以及准备在不列颠群岛上设置带有热核弹头的火箭发射场，这种不安更加加深了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，假如英国政府把本国的领土变为矛头指向苏联、指向苏联和平居民的火箭武器基地，那么摆在我们面前的就不是普通战争的计划。说到这里，赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联在必要的时候要采取预防措施来防止苏联和平城市遭到毁灭的威胁，那就是：“我们也将不得不装设带原子弹头和氢弹头的火箭，以免措手不及”。赫鲁晓夫写道，如果苏联由于遭到进攻而蒙受巨大的损失，那么，毁灭性的回击将给不列颠群岛带来更严重的后果。
    他指出，如果各国人民都要求本国政府通过和平途径来解决时机成熟了的国际问题，结束“冷战”，发展各国人民之间的文化、贸易和其他方面的联系，那么战争的危险就能防止，各国人民之间的信任将得到加强。赫鲁晓夫再次强调指出，高级会议将是达到这种地步的重要步骤。
