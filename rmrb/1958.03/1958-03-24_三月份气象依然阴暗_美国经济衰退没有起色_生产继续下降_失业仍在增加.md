Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 23rd: Despite the various measures taken by the U.S. government to prevent the economic recession from worsening, the impact of the economic recession in the United States continues to grow.

According to an Associated Press report on the 22nd, contrary to the U.S. government's expectations, the number of unemployed in major U.S. labor markets continued to increase in March. The American news agency, based on on-site surveys of the nation's ten largest employment areas, said that from mid-February to mid-March, the number of unemployed in major U.S. employment areas increased by about 150,000. The report said that usually from February to April, the number of unemployed decreases, but this change did not occur in March this year.

In another message, the Associated Press said that production in many important industrial sectors in the United States is also continuing to decline. In the week ending March 14, the operating rate of the steel industry remained at a low level of just over 50%; oil production was about 20% lower than in the same period a year ago, and large construction contracts fell by 25%. As for the automobile industry, which largely determines the level of business activity, the situation is also extremely bad. News reports say that the current production volume of cars and trucks in the United States has decreased by 31% compared to last year.

Harvard University economist Slichter estimates that, with the sharp decline in industrial production, the current U.S. gross national product is $3.6 billion lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, and about $11 billion lower than in the third quarter of last year.

Other reflections of the continued decline in business activity include: freight volume recently decreased by 21.4% compared to a year ago; manufacturing orders decreased by $1 billion in January; and unfilled orders were $15 billion lower at the beginning of February than a year ago, etc. (Attached picture)

    三月份气象依然阴暗
    美国经济衰退没有起色
    生产继续下降　失业仍在增加
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：尽管美国政府采取种种措施来阻止经济衰退继续恶化，但是经济衰退的冲击在美国仍然是有增无已。
    据美联社22日报道，和美国政府的预期相反，美国主要劳工市场的失业人数在3月份继续增加。这家美国通讯社根据对全国十个最大的就业地区进行的现场调查说，从2月中旬到3月中旬，美国各大就业地区的失业人数增加了约十五万人。消息说，往常在2月份到4月份，失业人数都是减少的，但是今年3月份却没有发生这样的变化。
    美联社在另一条消息中说，美国许多重要工业部门的生产也在继续下降。在到3月14日为止的一周中，钢铁工业的开工率仍然是维持在50％多一点的低水平上；石油生产比一年前同期下降了约20％，大型建筑合同下降了25％。至于在很大程度上决定着企业活计水平的汽车工业，情况也极为不好。有消息说，目前美国汽车和卡车的生产量比去年减少了31％。
    哈佛大学经济学家斯利彻特尔估计，在工业生产急剧下降的情况下，目前美国的国民生产总值比去年第四季减少了三十六亿美元，比去年第三季减少了约一百一十亿美元。
    反映企业活动衰退继续发展的还有：货运量最近比一年前减少了21.4％；制造业的订货单在1月份减少了十亿美元；未完成的订货单在2月初比一年前减少了一百五十亿美元等等。（附图片）
