    The Ministry of Forestry recently rewarded several counties with remarkable achievements in afforestation and greening work, and Wang Zhiying, a forestry labor model who initiated the construction of "ten-thousand-mu forests."
    The rewarded counties are: Xingtai County and Pinggu County in Hebei Province, Xia County in Shanxi Province, Wushan County, Minqin County, and Qin'an County in Gansu Province, Jianghua Yao Autonomous County and Changning County in Hunan Province, Guangning County in Guangdong Province, Chifeng County and Dengkou County in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Da Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County in Guangxi Province.
    Forestry labor model Wang Zhiying is the secretary of the Communist Youth League General Branch of the Dengta United Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei Province. In 1956, under Wang Zhiying's initiative, the Dengta United Cooperative built the first "ten-thousand-mu forest" on Lingxiao Mountain. Subsequently, a vigorous campaign to create "ten-thousand-mu forests" was launched throughout the county and the province. Recently, Wang Zhiying organized a youth afforestation team to go to Lingxiao Mountain to carry out long-term forest cultivation and protection work. The banner on Lingxiao Mountain has become a model for young people across the country to learn from.

    林业部最近又奖励了在造林绿化工作方面成绩显著的一些县和倡议营造“万亩林”的林业劳动模范王志英。
    得到奖励的县份是：河北省邢台县、平谷县，山西省夏县，甘肃省武山县、民勤县、秦安县，湖南省江华瑶族自治县、常宁县，广东省广宁县，内蒙古自治区赤峰县、磴口县，广西省大苗山苗族自治县。
    林业劳动模范王志英是河北省邢台县灯塔联合社共青团总支书记。1956年，在王志英的倡议下，灯塔联合社在灵霄山上营造了第一个“万亩林”。接着，全县、全省掀起了轰轰烈烈的造“万亩林”运动。最近，王志英又组织了一个青年造林专业队走上灵霄山，进行长期育林和护林工作。灵霄山上的这面旗帜，已成为全国青年学习的榜样。
