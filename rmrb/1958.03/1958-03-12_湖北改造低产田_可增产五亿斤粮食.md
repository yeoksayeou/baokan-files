Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Telegram: Hubei Province, while vigorously developing water conservancy, has used various methods to transform more than 3.2 million mu of backward fields with low yields and poor soil quality. Based on an increase of 150 jin of grain per mu, this item alone could increase the province's grain production by approximately 500 million jin.

According to the experience of various localities, mobilizing the masses to improve the soil on a large scale also requires careful accounting and organization of on-site visits. Taoyuan Fan in Macheng County has more than 300 mu of barren sandbars, which in the past only yielded 40 to 50 jin per mu of wheat and ginned cotton. After soil improvement was carried out in this area in the winter of 1956, the per-mu yield of wheat in 1957 reached 240 jin; the per-mu yield of ginned cotton reached 152 jin. After the Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a site meeting on soil improvement in Taoyuan Fan in December of last year with representatives from more than 70 agricultural cooperatives, soil improvement work was launched throughout the county. By the end of January, soil improvement had been completed on more than 77,000 mu of backward fields.

    湖北改造低产田
    可增产五亿斤粮食
    本报特约新华社武汉电　湖北省在大兴水利同时，用各种办法改造了产量低、土质差的落后田地三百二十多万亩。每亩以增产粮食一百五十斤计，仅这一项，全省便可增产粮食五亿斤左右。
    根据各地经验，发动群众大规模改良土壤，也要算细账，组织现场参观。麻城县桃园畈有三百多亩荒沙洲，过去亩产小麦、籽棉都只不过四、五十斤。1956年冬对这块地方进行土壤改良后，1957年小麦达到亩产二百四十斤；籽棉亩产一百五十二斤。中共麻城县委去年12月召集七十多个农业社的代表在桃园畈举行改良土壤现场会以后，改良土壤工作即在全县开展起来。到1月底，已有七万七千多亩落后田地完成了土壤改良。
