Mountainous Area Power Stations Dot the Landscape
Fujian's Yongchun Transforms its Appearance

    (Our report) Yongchun County, a mountainous area in Fujian, now has one-third of its townships using electricity to develop production and for lighting, and more than half of its villages using machinery to process agricultural and sideline products.

    Since 1956, the county has proposed the principle of "people-run, government-assisted," relying on agricultural cooperatives to raise funds and build small hydropower stations diligently and thriftily, and vigorously constructing hydropower and water-powered stations. Currently, the county has a total of forty-seven hydro and water-powered stations. Since the large-scale construction of hydropower and water-powered stations, more than thirty kinds of agricultural and sideline product processing, such as rice milling, flour milling, sweet potato grinding, and feed processing, have been mechanized, saving a large amount of labor and solving the contradiction between developing production and labor shortages. This has greatly promoted the development of agriculture, sideline industries, and forestry production. Many agricultural cooperatives have begun to use electricity for farmland irrigation and field operations. For example, the Taoyuan Cooperative uses electric lights at night to work overtime to repair reservoirs and rush-plant wheat. In the past, the Shuguang Cooperative had difficulty transporting large quantities of timber due to inconvenient mountain transportation. Now, with electric sawmills, large quantities of timber are sawn into planks and transported out, greatly increasing the income of cooperative members and encouraging their enthusiasm for afforestation.

    The Yongchun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has now formulated a plan to build sixty new hydropower stations by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, with a power generation capacity of 2,000 kilowatts. It also requires the mechanization of all agricultural and sideline product processing within one year, three hydropower stations in every township and a water-powered station in every cooperative within two years. This year, agricultural production will increase by 83.1% compared to 1957, and the average income per cooperative member will increase by 80% compared to 1957. Within three years, the value of local industrial output will be increased to exceed the value of agricultural output by 25%.

### 山区电站星罗棋布  福建永春面貌改观

    山区电站星罗棋布
    福建永春面貌改观
    本报讯　福建山区永春县，已经有三分之一的乡开始用电力发展生产和照明，并有半数以上的乡村用机械加工农业和副业产品。
    自1956年以来，这个县就提出民办公助，依靠农业社自筹资金、勤俭建立小型水电站的原则，大力建设水电站和水力站。现在全县共有水电、水力站四十七个。自从大批建立水电站、水力站之后，碾米、磨粉、磨薯和饲料等三十多种农业和副业产品的加工都用机械，节省了大量劳动力，解决了发展生产和劳动力不足的矛盾。这大大地促进了农业、副业和林业生产的发展。许多农业社开始利用电力进行农田灌溉和田间操作。如桃园社晚上利用电灯照明加班修水库和抢种小麦。曙光社过去由于山区交通不便，大量木材不能运出，现在有了电动锯木，把大量木材锯成木板运出，大大增加了社员收入，鼓舞了社员造林积极性。
    现在中共永春县委已经制订出规划，到第二个五年计划末期，要新建六十个水电站，发电能力达到二千瓩，并要求一年实现农副产品加工全部机械化，二年内乡乡有三个水电站，社社有水力站。今年农业生产将比1957年增产83.1％，社员每人平均收入将比1957年增加80％，并在三年内把地方工业产值提高到超过农业产值25％。
