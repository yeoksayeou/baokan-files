Stockings and Handcuffs
	Chi Bei'ou Poem, Hua Junwu Illustration
How thoughtful is America’s foreign “aid”, providing both nylon stockings and steel handcuffs. The stockings are for their puppet rulers to adorn their wives' legs, while the handcuffs are used to lock up the millions of rebellious fists. The American masters aren’t particularly concerned about the attire of Turkish women, it's just that warehouses in New York are overflowing with surplus stockings. "Foreign aid" ensures the "safety" of their wallets and can also alleviate the pressing economic difficulties. Although America doesn't have enough handcuffs for its own use, it must first supply its servants. Because if the servants' regime cannot be maintained, America's plan to dominate the world will fail. "American aid" is indeed like a sturdy pair of handcuffs; whoever reaches out for it will lose their freedom. "American aid" is also like thin nylon stockings; anyone who isn't blind can see through what's behind it.

News report: The United States' "aid" to Turkey includes nylon stockings. The United States is transporting a large number of handcuffs to Jordan by plane. (Picture attached)

    丝袜和手铐
    池北偶诗　华君武图美国对外“援助”想得多么周到，有尼龙丝袜也有钢铁手铐。丝袜给他们豢养的统治者打扮夫人的大腿，手铐用来把那千万双反抗的拳头锁牢。美国老爷并非特别关怀土耳其妇女的装扮，只因纽约货仓里过剩的丝袜堆积如山。“对外援助”保障了他们荷包的“安全”也可以缓和一下咄咄逼人的经济困难。美国制造的手铐虽然自己还不够用，但是不能不首先供应他们的仆从。因为如果仆从的江山保不住，美国称霸世界的计划就要落空。“美援”倒真像是一副结实的手铐，谁向它伸出手来谁就会失去自由；“美援”也像薄如蝉翼的尼龙丝袜，只要不是瞎子都能把它背后的东西看透。
