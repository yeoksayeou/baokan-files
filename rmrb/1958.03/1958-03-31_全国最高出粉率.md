    National Highest Flour Extraction Rate
    (Our report) In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the Xining Flour Mill boldly set advanced targets. It adopted technical measures such as preventing loss, lengthening the flour path, adjusting the sieve silk, and increasing the middle-route bran brushing, creating the nation's highest record for wheat flour extraction rate: 92.5 jin of flour per 100 jin of wheat, with the quality fully meeting standards. All the factory workers have guaranteed that they will consolidate the flour extraction rate above 92% in the future. In this way, the same amount of wheat can produce 10% more flour than before, and this year will produce four million jin more flour than last year.

    全国最高出粉率
    本报讯　西宁面粉厂在反浪费反保守运动中，大胆地订出先进指标，采用了防止损耗、加长粉路、调整筛绢、增加中路刷麸等技术措施，创造了小麦出粉率的全国最高纪录，每百斤小麦出粉九十二斤半，质量完全合乎标准。全厂职工提出保证，今后要把出粉率巩固在92％以上。这样，同等数量的小麦可比以前多出面粉10％，今年将比去年多出面粉四百万斤。
