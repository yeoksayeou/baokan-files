    "Lost and Found"
    On a vacant lot in the southwest corner outside Guang'anmen in Beijing, there are three piles of steel materials of different specifications. I counted them: there are more than 300 small steel ingots, more than 300 large square steels, and more than 40 flat steels. According to the dimensions marked on the steel, it is estimated to be more than 1,100 tons, worth about 550,000 yuan.
    There are no factories, no government offices, and no construction sites nearby. Which unit do these three piles of steel belong to? According to nearby residents, no one has touched them for more than a year. However, steel materials do not fall from the sky; they must have an owner. During the Great Leap Forward, it is a waste to leave thousands of tons of steel exposed to the wind and rain. I suggest that the Beijing municipal authorities in charge of material distribution call up these three piles of steel.

    “失物”招领
    北京广安门外西南角的一块空地上，有三堆不同规格的钢材。我数了一下：有小型钢锭三百多块，大型方钢三百多块，扁钢四十多根。根据钢材上所标的尺寸计算，大约有一千一百吨以上，价值达五十五万元左右。
    这里附近没有工厂，没有机关，也没有工地。这三堆钢材是哪个单位的呢？据附近居民说，已经一年多没有人动过了。但是，钢材不会从天上掉下来，它一定有主。在大跃进中，让成千吨钢材在那里任风吹雨淋，是浪费。我建议北京市主管物资分配的机关把这三堆钢材调用。
