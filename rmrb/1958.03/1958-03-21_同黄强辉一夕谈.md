    A Night Talk with Huang Qianghui
    Shi Zhong
    Since winning the international individual weightlifting championship in the lightweight division earlier this month in Moscow, Huang Qianghui has become a figure attracting attention from sports enthusiasts both at home and abroad. Shortly after his return to China, I visited this weightlifter who had triumphed in Moscow.
    “It’s a pity,” Huang Qianghui said to me as soon as he saw me.
    “Why? You've already won the championship, what's there to regret!”
    He replied with a smile: "Because my desire to break the world record wasn't realized. That day, in the clean and jerk, I successfully lifted 145 kg on the first attempt and 150 kg on the second, so I asked for 155 kg on the last attempt, which is one kilogram more than the world record held by the Soviet athlete Saksonov. At the time, I had already pulled the 155 kg barbell up, but my waist bent too severely, resulting in failure. If my waist movement had been normal at the time, my wish to break the world record might have been realized."
    "Your total score of 382.5 kg to win the championship is already good enough. Based on what you just said, I believe the world record for the lightweight clean and jerk will be broken by you sooner or later."
    "Yes! I have confidence, but I hope this wish can be realized soon."
    "What is your evaluation of your competitor, the world champion from the Soviet Union, Bushuyev?"
    "Bushuyev has considerable strength. This time, his total score was the same as mine, but he lost to me in body weight, and his snatch performance this time didn't reach his usual level. Therefore, Bushuyev will still be a strong opponent for me in the future. I should also learn from him well."
    Huang Qianghui then introduced the situations of Chen Jingkai and Zhao Qingkui to me. He said: "Although Chen Jingkai also won the championship this time, his total score was not as good as it was at the Moscow International Youth Friendship Games last year, mainly because his physical condition wasn't very good this time. For the first clean and jerk attempt at 135 kg, he initially felt relaxed and had energy to spare, but then his leg suddenly cramped, and he only managed to lift it on the second attempt. If his physical condition had been better, his score might have been even better."
    "This time, among the three of us, the most attention was paid to Zhao Qingkui, especially his final request to clean and jerk 177 kg. Because the current world record for this event is held by an American athlete, Zhao Qingkui's bold attempt caused a sensation in the audience. However, Zhao Qingkui's international competition experience is not yet rich enough, and he was quite nervous on the spot, resulting in failure. Nevertheless, some people on the spot gave him a very high evaluation."
    Talking about friendly interactions with athletes from various countries, our topic turned to the only American athlete who came to Moscow to participate in the competition, Conno (champion of the 16th Olympic Games, 1957 world champion).
    "This time we also saw the American weightlifter Conno in Moscow. He came to us three times, asking us how we train, asking if Chen Jingkai could really do deep knee squats (deep knee squats are a method for weightlifters to practice leg strength. It involves putting the barbell on the back of the shoulders and bending and straightening the legs.) with 200 kg, etc. Each time we gave him satisfactory answers. In the end, he even took a picture of Chen Jingkai's two thighs with a camera. He said that he would introduce the training situation of Chinese weightlifters in American magazines."
    A few days ago, I saw Huang Qianghui again in the weightlifting room of the Beijing Gymnasium, and he had already begun his intense training. He is confidently advancing towards the world record. (Attached picture)
    When Huang Qianghui clean and jerked 155 kg in the international individual weightlifting competition this time (the world record is 154 kg), he had already pulled the barbell up, but because of poor waist movement, he did not succeed. This is a picture of him clean and jerking 155 kg.

### 同黄强辉一夕谈

    同黄强辉一夕谈
    师仲
    黄强辉，自从月初在莫斯科获得国际个人举重赛轻量级冠军之后，已经是国内外体育爱好者注意的人物了，在他回国后不久，我就去访问了这位自莫斯科凯旋而归的举重家。
      “很遗憾。”一见到我，黄强辉就说了这句语。
    “为什么？你已经获得了冠军，还有什么可遗憾的！”
    他笑着回答我说：“因为我的打破世界纪录愿望没有实现。那天挺举，第一次一百四十五公斤、第二次一百五十公斤都挺得很顺利，因此我就最后要了一百五十五公斤，这比苏联运动员萨克松诺夫保持的世界最高纪录还多一公斤。当时一百五十五公斤的杠铃，已经被我拉了起来，可是腰部弯得太厉害，结果失败了。如果当时我腰部动作正常的话，打破世界纪录的愿望可能实现。”
    “你这次能达到三百八十二点五公斤的总成绩，而获得冠军已经是不坏的了。根据你刚才这样说法，相信轻量级挺举世界纪录迟早会被你打破的。”
    “是啊！我有信心，但是我希望这个愿望能早日实现。”
    “你对你的竞争者世界冠军苏联的布舒耶夫的评价如何？”
    “布舒耶夫是有相当实力的，这次他的总成绩与我相同，只是在体重上输了给我，而且这次他的抓举成绩没有达到应有水平。因此，布舒耶夫今后还是我的强有力的对手。我还应该很好地向他学习。”
    黄强辉接着就给我介绍陈镜开和赵庆奎的情况。他说：“陈镜开这次虽然也获得了冠军，但是总成绩不如去年莫斯科国际青年友谊运动会那次好，主要是他这次的身体状况不太好。第一次挺举一百三十五公斤，开始他自己觉得还很轻松、有余力，后来腿突然抽筋了，直到第二次举才挺了起来。要是身体状况好些的话，他的成绩可能更好些。”
    “这次，在我们三人中间，人们最注意的还是赵庆奎，尤其是对他最后要求挺举一百七十七公斤这一点上。因为目前保持这项世界纪录的是美国选手，所以当时赵庆奎的大胆尝试轰动了全场。不过，赵庆奎的国际比赛经验还不够丰富，临场比较紧张，结果没成功。尽管如此当场有人对他的评价还是很高的。”
    谈到与各国运动员友谊接触时，我们的话题转到了这次去莫斯科参加比赛的唯一美国选手康诺（十六届奥运会冠军、1957年世界冠军）的身上。
    “这次我们在莫斯科还见到了美国举重家康诺。他来找了我们三次，问我们是如何进行锻炼的、问陈镜开是否真的能深膝蹲（深膝蹲是举重运动员练习腿力的方法。就是把杠铃放在后肩上，腿部一屈一伸。）二百公斤，等等，每次我们都使他得到满意的解答。最后他还把陈镜开的两条大腿用相机照了下来。他说，他要在美国杂志上介绍中国举重运动员的锻炼情况。”
    日前，在北京体育馆举重室又见到了黄强辉，他已经开始了紧张的锻炼。他满怀信心地向着世界纪录挺进。（附图片）
    黄强辉这次在国际个人举重赛中，挺举155公斤时（世界纪录是154公斤）已把杠铃拉了起来，因为腰部动作不好，没有成功。这是他在挺举155公斤时的情形。
