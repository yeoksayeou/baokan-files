This newspaper specially provided by Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th - The 37 factories in Chengdu have reformed unreasonable wages and benefits after a great debate.

The 37 state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Chengdu, based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the opinions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee and Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on improving unreasonable wages and benefits, have successively launched a major debate on the issue of improving wages and benefits among workers since late December of last year. The content of the debate included the Labor Insurance Regulations promulgated by the State Council, wage and benefit provisions, and special welfare provisions of some factories. After a month of great debate, the factories not only broke down old bad habits and outdated rules and regulations, saving the state a large amount of unreasonable expenditure, but also gave all workers a vivid and specific socialist education.

Before the debate, there were many unreasonable phenomena in the wage and welfare issues of each factory. For example, in addition to free medical treatment, haircuts, and bathing at the Chengdu Plywood Factory, the rent was very low, the wages of the cooks were paid by the public, as well as safety bonuses, team leader allowances, night shift food allowances, and employees didn't pay for burning waste wood in the factory. In addition to free medical treatment, low rent, and ten other benefits at the Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory, employees were also given free train tickets. Workers at the Yuhua Textile Factory were even provided with toilet paper by the public. The workers had become accustomed to these unreasonable phenomena. Therefore, at the beginning of the debate, some workers resisted the practice of improving unreasonable wages and benefits, and some cadres were hesitant, fearing that workers would have ideological problems and be difficult to lead.

After studying these situations, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party Committees of each factory believed that this debate was not only an ideological struggle, but also a struggle to change customs and habits. If the concept of starting from the 600 million people is not clearly established among the workers, and the relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the state is not correctly resolved ideologically, and the relationship between improving living standards and developing production is not correctly resolved, it will be impossible to debate the issues in depth and thoroughly. In order to organize this debate well, the Party committees of each factory generally adopted methods such as extensive airing of views, great contention, big-character posters, and discussion meetings to improve the socialist consciousness of workers by presenting facts and reasoning. When adopting these methods, they relied on the recollections and comparisons of veteran workers, speaking from their own experiences, to persuade and educate workers. When debating the issue of wages and benefits at the Chengdu Locomotive Repair Factory, many veteran workers spoke at the meeting about the present and compared it with the past, explaining the happiness of the new society and the necessity of abolishing unreasonable wages and benefits. The narratives of the veteran workers not only moved the young workers, but also educated the veteran workers. Lu Liquan, an old worker who originally had opinions on canceling free train tickets, also said: "I suffered so much in the old society, and now I have forgotten it all. After listening to their recollections and comparisons, I feel that I should not demand too much in life now, and everything should start from the 600 million people." Qinggong Li Mingquan also made a self-criticism. He said: "I don't know anything about the suffering of the old workers in the past. I wanted to make trouble for some welfare, mainly for personal enjoyment. It's really not right."

Various factories also organized visits. Young workers from the state-owned Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory visited the local state-owned Hongqi Iron Factory and saw that some of the machines in the factory were still from the Qing Dynasty, and the workers did not have enough beds to sleep on, so some slept on the floor, and the canteen was small, so they ate under the eaves. However, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was very high. The entire factory overfulfilled the first five-year plan 200 days ahead of schedule. These facts were very educational for the workers of the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory. Many people said with emotion: Compared with the Hongqi Iron Factory, we are like in heaven, what else are we dissatisfied with? So the workers asked to cancel the ten unreasonable demands put forward in the airing of views, such as free bathing, drinking tea, haircuts, medical treatment, watching movies, taking buses to and from work, and night shift meals. Some small factories also went to the countryside to visit, and after seeing the lives of the peasants, they felt that they should not demand too much in terms of living welfare at present, and should think more about the 600 million people.

In the debate, each factory adopted the method of calculating big accounts and detailed accounts. The Chengdu Yuhua Textile Factory, in response to the fact that some workers disagreed with canceling night shift allowances and were dissatisfied with the nursery fees, calculated three accounts for the workers. The first account calculated the ratio of accumulation and consumption in the factory, and consumption exceeded accumulation. The second account calculated that if the state spent three yuan less per month on each worker for unreasonable wages and benefits, the country's 24 million workers would spend 864 million yuan less per year. Investing this money in national economic construction could build twelve Yangtze River Bridges. The third account calculated the night shift allowance. Night shift allowances are inherently unreasonable. Working at night and resting during the day, everyone has to take turns, so there is no need to add allowances. Moreover, each person works an average of six night shifts per month, earning an allowance of 1.2 yuan, which can only buy three Sichuan opera tickets, but the state has to spend 8,000 yuan each year, enough to pay the wages of more than 160 workers for a month. After calculating these three accounts, the workers' understanding improved, and the workers proposed "We want the Yangtze River Bridge, not unreasonable wages and benefits." Workers with lower incomes also said: As long as we plan our living expenses and manage our families diligently and thriftily, we can live. Investing the saved money in construction can catch up with England as soon as possible. The Locomotive Repair Factory used the method of calculating detailed accounts to illustrate the huge waste caused to the state by the railway free ticket system. According to calculations for only three quarters from 1956 to 1957, the factory spent more than 1,100 free tickets, and the state received more than 150,000 yuan less in income. Not only was the national economy damaged, but it also increased railway congestion. After these charts were published in the form of big-character posters, many workers became clear-headed. More than 95% of the workers in the factory agreed to abolish the unreasonable free ticket system, which had been a long-standing bad habit.

After this debate, the workers correctly resolved the relationship between national interests and individual interests, production and life, and workers and peasants in their thinking, and understood the truth of starting from the 600 million people. The vast majority of workers actively supported the abolition of unreasonable living welfare. Thirty-one factories have implemented the regulations formulated by the Sichuan Provincial Committee and Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in March, including raising the standard of rent for workers' dormitories, implementing a small amount of self-payment for public medical care, changing the wages of cooks to be borne by the people who eat together, the fees for nurseries and kindergartens to be borne by the parents, and canceling night shift food allowances, foreman allowances, and clothing allowances. Some factories have also decided to abolish some special unreasonable treatments. For example, the Qianjin Iron Factory abolished the master allowance, the Wood Processing Factory and the Plywood Factory abolished the preferential treatment for workers buying waste materials without paying or paying less, the Yuhua Textile Factory abolished the regulation that toilet paper was supplied by the public, and the Locomotive Factory abolished the free train ride system. After the Hongqi Iron Factory implemented rent charges in single dormitories, 50% of the workers automatically went to the accounting department to pay within three days. Some workers in the Locomotive Factory were originally unwilling to work night shifts and often asked for leave on the grounds of illness. After this debate, the workers were willing to work night shifts.

This debate has brought about significant changes in the workers' thinking and lifestyle. Thrift and simplicity have become the prevailing atmosphere. In the past, some young workers would go to the streets and watch movies after work. Now there are fewer people going to the streets and watching movies, and more people studying politics and technology after work.

### 工人阶级做表率　事事不忘六亿人  成都三十七个工厂职工自觉改革不合理的工资福利

    工人阶级做表率　事事不忘六亿人
    成都三十七个工厂职工自觉改革不合理的工资福利
    本报特约新华社成都18日电　成都三十七个工厂经过大辩论改革了不合理的工资福利。
    成都三十七个国营和地方国营工厂，根据中共三中全会的精神和中共四川省委、成都市委改进不合理工资福利的意见，从去年12月下旬起，陆续在职工中展开了一场改进工资福利问题的大辩论。辩论的内容包括国务院颁布的劳动保险条例、工资福利规定和一些工厂的特殊福利规定。经过一个月的大辩论，各厂不仅打破了旧有的陋规恶习和过时的规章，为国家节约了一大笔不合理的开支，并且使所有职工受到一次生动具体的社会主义教育。
    辩论之前，各厂在工资福利问题上都存在许多不合理的现象。例如成都胶合板厂除了看病、理发、洗澡不出钱，房租很低，炊事人员工资由公家负担以及安全奖、工段长津贴、夜班伙食津贴外，职工烧厂内的废木材也不付钱。成都机车修理厂除了看病不出钱、房租很低等十项福利外，职工乘火车还要发免费票。裕华纺织厂职工甚至连大小便也要公家发草纸。对这些不合理的现象，职工们已经习以为常。所以，在开始辩论的时候，有一部分职工对改进不合理工资福利的作法有抵触情绪，有的干部怕工人闹思想问题不好领导，表现犹豫。
    中共成都市委和各厂党委研究了这些情况后认为，这场辩论不仅是一场思想上的斗争，也是一场移风易俗的斗争。如果不在职工中明确树立从六亿人口出发的观念，从思想上正确解决个人和集体、个人和国家的关系；生活改善和发展生产的关系，就不可能把问题辩深辩透。为了组织好这场辩论，各厂党委普遍采用了大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报、座谈会等方法，通过摆事实、讲道理来提高职工社会主义觉悟。在采用这些方法的时候，都依靠老工人的回忆对比，现身说法，说服和教育职工。成都机车修理厂在辩论工资福利问题的时候，许多老工人纷纷在会上讲现在，比过去，说明新社会的幸福和取消不合理工资福利的必要。老工人的叙述，不仅感动了青年工人，同时也教育了老工人。原来对取消免票乘车有意见的老工人陆李权也说：“我在旧社会受了那么多罪，现在竟都忘了，听了他们的回忆对比后，才觉得现在不应该在生活上要求过高，一切要从六亿人口出发才对。”青工李明权也作了自我检讨。他说：“我对过去老工人们受的苦一点不知道，想闹点福利，主要是为了个人享受，实在不应该。”
    各个工厂还组织参观访问。国营成都量具刃具厂的青工参观了地方国营红旗铁工厂，看到这个工厂有些机器还是清朝的，职工睡觉的床铺不够，有的就睡地板，食堂小了就在屋檐下吃饭。但是，工人们的劳动热情很高。全厂提前两百天超额完成了第一个五年计划。这些事实对量具刃具厂职工教育很大。许多人感动地说：和红旗铁工厂比，我们犹如在天堂，还有什么不满意呢？于是职工都纷纷要求取消在鸣放中提出的洗澡、喝茶、理发、看病、看电影、上下班坐汽车、夜班伙食等十项不要钱的不合理要求。有些小厂还到农村去访问，看了农民的生活后，都觉得目前对生活福利不应该要求过高，要多从六亿人口想问题。
    在辩论中，各个工厂都采取算大账、算细账的办法。成都裕华纺织厂针对部分职工不同意取消夜班津贴和不满意托儿所收费的情况，向职工算了三笔账。第一笔算该厂积累和消费的比例，消费超过了积累。第二笔算国家若在每个职工身上每月少开支三元不合理的工资福利费，全国二千四百万职工一年即可少支出八亿六千四百万元。用这笔钱投入国家经济建设，可以修建十二座长江大桥。第三笔算夜班津贴账。夜班津贴本来就不合理，晚上工作，白天休息，人人都要轮上，用不着另加津贴。而且每个人每月平均作六天夜班，收入津贴一元二角，只能买三张川剧票，但国家每年却要支出八千元，够一百六十多个职工发一个月的工资。算了这三笔账后，职工的认识提高了，工人提出了“我们要长江大桥，不要不合理的工资福利”。收入较少的职工也说：只要我们计划一下生活开支，勤俭持家，是可以过生活的。把节约的钱投入建设，可以早日赶上英国。机车修理厂用算细账的办法说明铁路免票制度给国家造成的巨大浪费。仅该厂从1956年到1957年三个季度计算，共开支一千一百多张免票，国家少收入十五万多元。不但国家经济受到损失，还增加了铁路的拥挤现象。将这些图表用大字报形式公布后，许多职工头脑清醒了。全厂95％以上的职工都同意取消多年来陈规恶习的不合理免票制度。
    经过这一场辩论以后，职工们在思想上正确解决了国家利益和个人利益、生产和生活、工人和农民的关系，懂得了从六亿人口出发的道理。绝大部分职工都积极拥护取消不合理的生活福利。有三十一个厂，已在3月份实行了中共四川省委、成都市委制订的提高职工宿舍房租标准、公费医疗实行少量自费办法，炊事员工资改由搭伙人员负担，托儿所、幼儿园费用由家长负担，取消夜班伙食津贴及工长津贴、服装津贴等项规定。有的厂还决定取消一些特殊的不合理待遇。如前进铁工厂取消师傅津贴，制材厂、胶合板厂取消职工买废材不出钱或少出钱的优待，裕华纺织厂取消解便纸由公家供给的规定，机车厂取消免费乘车制度。红旗铁工厂在单身宿舍实行房租收费后，三天内就有50％的职工自动到会计科缴费。机车厂部分职工原来不愿意上夜班，常常借故请假。在这次辩论以后，职工们都愿意作夜班了。
    这次辩论使职工的思想和生活作风有了显著的转变。勤俭朴素已经形成风气。过去有的青工下班就逛马路、看电影。现在逛马路、看电影的人少了，下班后学政治、学技术的人多了。
