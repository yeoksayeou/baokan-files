After Watching the New Film "Riding the Wind and Waves"
    Qiu Yang

    Recently, everyone has been in a state of extreme excitement. Many things that seemed extraordinarily distant yesterday suddenly stand before us like myths. This is an even more extraordinary spring. Hundreds of millions of people are elated, stepping into a new historical era! The film "Riding the Wind and Waves" is being shown in such a season, and it should be said that it has a certain significance, because the theme of the story coincides with the rhythm of the times.

    The story depicts how China's first batch of female sailors grew up rapidly. Through this story, it demonstrates the heroic spirit and hard-working spirit of the youth who grew up in our era, and it is even more far-reaching because it depicts three young women. The heroine, Liang Ying, is called "Locomotive" because she tends to rush around recklessly. This nickname does not only describe a girl who loves to jump and make noise; it actually explains the common character of the younger generation in our era full of miracles. "Being able to rush and being good at breaking through" is based on courage and confidence, which are precisely the valuable qualities especially needed in the current Great Leap Forward. As the leading aspect of the film, this should be affirmed.

    It can be perceived that the writers and directors have the desire to treat the film as a bright comedy. From the point of view of the film's theme of active and upward significance, it was originally possible to express it in a comedy style, but the liveliness of the style depends on the clarity of thought, rather than being determined by certain details that may be able to elicit a laugh. A lively comedy style is a means, not an end. If one is too enthusiastic about such detailed depictions, using them as the basis for constructing a comedy style, it is very easy to damage the perfect communication of the theme. This film has such shortcomings. For example: Liang Ying trips up the physical education director several times; she runs to the department store and crawls all over the floor in the crowd because she knocked things down; ...etc. These little gags, which either simply explain the character's personality or are detached from the development of the plot, if勉强are勉强explained as a regulation of lively plots, then, immediately after the scene of Liang Ying studying hard, there is a description of her propping up her head with a stack of books and falling asleep, which makes it unclear whether the writers and directors are praising, pitying, or mocking this behavior. The scene where Liang Ying falls ill due to forgetting to eat and sleep, and still念念不忘念念不忘driving during her high fever, thus感动感动Captain Zhao, was originally more touching, but because of the comedy treatment of Liang Ying holding the chief engineer's head to "drive" and Captain Zhao hiding in a blanket and being embarrassed by a kitten, it mixed mud and pearls together, which also weakened its touching power. Although some of these treatments aroused laughter from the audience, when weighing the pros and cons, one cannot help but regret that the loss outweighs the gain.

    Finally, I would like to talk about the story itself. There have been many works depicting intellectuals entering life recently, but the transition from school to life is not simply a matter of applying what one has learned or striving to master practical skills; it includes the process of going to the working masses, which is essentially a process of changing class standpoints and class feelings. Even for a "rushing" general like Liang Ying, the issue of "red" and "expert" still exists. However, like "Nurse's Diary," this film also neglects the depiction of this process; otherwise, the artistic effect that the film can exert would be better.

    新片“乘风破浪”观后
    丘扬
    最近以来，大家都处在极度的兴奋之中。许多昨天看来还是异常遥远的事物，突然神话般地矗立在眼前。这是一个更加不平常的春天。亿万人心花怒放，跨进了新的历史时代！影片“乘风破浪”在这样的季节里映出，应该说是有一定意义的，因为故事的主题正和时代的节奏相契合。
    故事描写的是我国第一批女海员如何飞速地成长了起来。通过这个故事，表现了生长于我们这个时代的青年的豪迈气概和艰苦顽强的学习精神，特别因为描写的是三位女青年，其意义就更为深远。女主角梁璎由于会乱冲乱闯被唤做“火车头”，这个称呼，并不只是形容一个爱跳爱闹的女孩性格而已，实则是说明了在我们这个充满奇迹的时代里，青年一代的共同性格。“能冲善闯”基础于勇敢和信心，这也正是在目前大跃进中特别需要的可贵品质。做为影片的主导方面来论述，这是应当肯定的。
    可以觉察得出，编导有把影片处理成为带有明快的喜剧风格的愿望。就影片主题积极向上的意义看来，表现为喜剧样式原是可以的，但，样式的活泼取决于思想的明朗，而不是决定于某些也许可发一噱的细节刻划。活泼的喜剧样式是手段而不是目的。如果过多地热衷于这样的细节刻划，以之做为构成喜剧风格的基础，却极易损害主题的完美传达。这部片子中就存在着这样的缺点。比如：梁璎几次撞体育主任跟头；跑到百货公司中因为挤掉了东西跪在人丛中满地乱爬；……等等这样一些或是简单地解释了人物性格，或脱离了情节发展的小噱头，如果勉强当做活泼情节的调剂来解释，那么，紧接着梁璎刻苦学习的场面之后，又出现了她垫起一叠书擎着头睡起觉来的描绘，就使人弄不清楚编导对这行为是赞美、怜惜、还是嘲讽了。梁璎因废寝忘食地学习病倒了，高烧中犹自念念不忘驾驶，因而感动了赵船长的场面，原是比较感人的，但是因为有了梁璎抱起轮机长的脑袋“驾驶”起来，以及赵船长躲进毛毡后被小猫搞的狼狈万分的喜剧处理，使泥沙与珠玉杂陈，便也减弱了它的感人力量。这样的一些处理，虽则也引起观众的笑声了，然而权衡轻重，却不能不惋惜得不偿失。
    最后，想谈一下故事本身。描写知识分子进入生活的作品最近不少，但是，从学校到生活之间，并不简单地只是一个学以致用或是努力掌握实用技术的问题，其中包括到劳动群众中去的过程，实质上也就是阶级立场阶级感情的变化过程，即使像梁璎这样的“闯”将吧，红、专的问题也还是存在着的。但是，和“护士日记”一样，这部片子也同样地忽略了这个过程的描写，否则影片所能发挥的艺术效果，会好一些。
