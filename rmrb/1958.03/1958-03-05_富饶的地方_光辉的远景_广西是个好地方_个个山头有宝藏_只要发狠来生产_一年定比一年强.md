Rich Land, Bright Prospects
Guangxi is a good place, every mountain has treasures
As long as we produce with determination, each year will definitely be stronger than the last

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is the third national autonomous region at the provincial level in our country. The Zhuang people living here number seven million and three thousand. It has the largest population of any minority nationality in the country. The autonomous region is also inhabited by Han, Yao, Miao, Dong, Mulam, Maonan, Gelao, Hui, Shui, and Lolo peoples. The total population of the region is over nineteen million.

The autonomous region has a land area of ​​more than 215,000 square kilometers, most of which is in the subtropical zone. The central and southern parts are covered with flourishing flowers and trees all year round, with green branches and leaves. Bunches of bananas hanging down and sugar cane forests are visible everywhere. The region currently has more than 37 million mu of cultivated land, with two to three harvests per year. Rare subtropical special economic crops in China—coffee, rubber, sea island cotton, lemongrass, and sisal hemp—have been extensively propagated in the autonomous region. Famous Shatien pomelos, longans, pineapples, lemons, oranges, and tangerines are sold throughout the country.

Underground resources are also extremely abundant. Manganese ore reserves account for a large proportion of the country's total, and tin ore reserves rank second in the country. Gold is one of the country's key producing areas. Coal, iron, lead, zinc, tungsten, petroleum, crystal and other minerals are also very rich. In the vast mountains and hills, there are more than 500 kinds of large and small local specialties and more than 1,000 kinds of medicinal materials, which earn a large amount of foreign exchange for the country every year.

"Guangxi is a good place, every mountain has treasures. As long as we produce with determination, each year will definitely be stronger than the last." Many folk songs reflect the determination and confidence of the people of all ethnic groups to build a prosperous and happy new Guangxi.

After more than eight years of tremendous efforts, the face of Guangxi has undergone fundamental changes. Grain and other agricultural products have increased year after year, and the living standards of people of all ethnic groups have improved significantly. Before liberation, Guangxi had almost no modern industry. Now there are 107 modern factories and mines (including 21 major reconstruction units) for non-ferrous metals, manganese ore, tin ore, electric power, machine manufacturing, automobile repair, and sugar refining. The total industrial output value (including handicrafts) accounts for 32.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the region. Railways, highways, culture and education have also greatly developed.

Since last winter, a high tide of water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and elimination of "four pests" campaigns has been launched throughout the region. More than 120,000 large and small water conservancy projects have been started, with an irrigation area of ​​more than 12 million mu, exceeding the total irrigation area built over the past thousands of years. This year, drought disasters can be basically eliminated in the paddy fields of 50 counties.

The situation of the Great Leap Forward has drawn a beautiful prospect for the autonomous region. The ten-year target of 800 jin of grain per mu will be completed six years ahead of schedule. The entire region will be basically greened in five years, and it will become a land of abundant oil tea, tung oil and fruits. Industry is catching up rapidly, and the total output value will catch up with or exceed the total agricultural output value within six years. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    富饶的地方　光辉的远景
    广西是个好地方　个个山头有宝藏
    只要发狠来生产　一年定比一年强
    广西僮族自治区是我国第三个相当于省一级的民族自治地方。居住在这里的僮族，有七百万零三千人。它在全国少数民族中，是人口最多的一个。自治区内还居住着汉、瑶、苗、侗、仫佬、毛难、仡佬、回、水家、倮倮等民族。全区共有一千九百多万人。
    自治区方圆有二十一万五千多平方公里，大部地区处于亚热带，中部、南部常年花木繁盛，枝叶青翠。到处可见香蕉串串下垂，甘蔗比比成林，全区现有耕地三千七百多万亩，每年收获两熟到三熟，国内稀有的亚热带特种经济作物——咖啡、橡胶、海岛棉、香茅草和剑麻，在自治区内已大量繁殖；著名的沙田柚、龙眼、波萝、柠檬、桔子和香橙等都运销全国。
    地下蕴藏也极为丰富。锰矿储藏量占全国很大比重，锡矿的储藏量为全国第二位，黄金是全国重点产区之一。煤、铁、铅、锌、钨、石油、水晶等矿藏也很丰富。在辽阔的山林里和丘陵地带，出产五百多种大小土特产品和一千多种药材，每年为国家换回大批外汇。
      “广西是个好地方，个个山头有宝藏。只要发狠来生产，一年定比一年强”。很多山歌里都反映出了各族人民建设繁荣幸福新广西的毅力和信心。
    经过八年多来的巨大努力，广西的面貌已经发生根本变化。粮食和其他农产品年年增产，各族人民的生活都有了显著改善。解放前夕的广西几乎没有现代化工业，如今出现了有色金属、锰矿、锡矿、电力、机器制造、汽车修配、制糖等现代化厂矿一百零七个（包括二十一个重大改建单位），工业总产值（包括手工业）已占全区工农业总产值的32.5％。铁路、公路、文教事业都有很大发展。
    自去冬开始，全区掀起了水利、积肥、造林、除“四害”运动的高潮。动工修建大小水利工程十二万多处，灌溉面积达一千二百多万亩，超过了几千年来兴修水利灌溉面积的总和。有五十个县的水田，今年就可以基本消灭旱灾。
    大跃进的形势已给自治区画出了一幅美好的前景。每亩产粮八百斤的十年指标，将提前于六年完成。五年内全区基本绿化，那时将变成盛产油茶、桐油和水果之乡。工业急起直追，六年内总产值要赶上或超过农业总产值。（据新华社讯）
