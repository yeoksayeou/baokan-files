    Railway Track-Laying Team (and another poem)
    Ding Li
    You arrived overnight,
    Laying and riveting!
    You have to build dozens of small railways
    Within three days.
    The task is so urgent,
    But you are full of confidence!
    Working more than ten hours a day,
    You don't know what it means to be tired.
    The eastern earthen hill had its top removed,
    The western stones piled up high.
    Hurry up and lay the small tracks,
    So that the dump trucks can show their might early...

      Blasting
    With a blast,
    More than half of the hilltop was blown away!
    Stones fly all over the place,
    Thick smoke rises to the sky.
    East entrance,
    West entrance,
    Piles of stones are all driven away.
    Today, peel off the skin of the mountain!
    Tomorrow, dissect the belly of the mountain!

    铁道铺轨队（外一首）
    丁力你们连夜赶到，铺的铺，铆的铆！要在三天以内，修好几十条小铁道。任务是这样紧迫，你们却信心百倍！每天要干十几个钟头，不知道什么叫累。东边的土山揭了顶，西边的石头一堆堆。赶紧铺好小铁轨，好让斗车早施威……
      爆　破一声爆破响，山头炸去了大半边！石块飞满地，浓烟冲上天。东山口，西山口，一堆堆石头全赶走。今天剥掉山的皮！明天要剖山的肚！
