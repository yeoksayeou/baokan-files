　　Demand True Redness

    The anti-Rightist movement has already pointed out to intellectuals that to become a working-class intellectual, they must strive for both redness and expertise. Now that the movement is deepening, Communist Party members should first examine themselves.

    Communist Party members are the vanguard of the working class. Many Communist Party members also hold leadership positions in their work. Only by bravely inviting the fire to burn oneself, listening to the opinions of the masses, and earnestly examining oneself can one first refine oneself to become redder, and thus more effectively lead the movement forward. Some Party organizations and members in institutions of higher learning, scientific research institutions, and cultural and health units have already done so.

    However, not every Party member has sufficient understanding of the significance of inviting the fire to burn oneself first. Some Communist Party members believe that "redness" is not the main issue for Communist Party members. The reason is: Communist Party members are inherently red. Facts have proven that joining the Party does not guarantee genuine redness or complete redness. Some are faded, some are pink, and some are red on the outside but white on the inside, and so on. Some Communist Party members exposed during the movement exhibit bureaucratic airs, complacency, arrogance, extravagance, delicacy, and even other unhealthy tendencies. Aren't these Communist Party members faded or pink? To achieve true redness or complete redness, one must first invite the fire to burn oneself, burning oneself red through and through.

    What is true redness? It is not the false redness of joining the Party organizationally but not ideologically, but rather the requirement to meet or conform to the standards of a Party member, being red inside and out. In this regard, non-Party intellectuals are the same. It is not just that joining the Party counts as red; even if one has not joined the Party, as long as one strives to measure oneself by the standards of a Party member and reach the standards of a Party member, one is also red. Such redness is true redness.

    要真红
    双反运动已经向知识分子指出，要成为工人阶级知识分子，必须力争红透专深。现在运动正走向深入，共产党员应当首先检查自己。
    共产党员是工人阶级的先锋队。许多共产党员，在工作中又是担任领导工作的。只有勇敢地引火烧身，听取群众的意见，认真检查自己，才能首先把自己炼得更红，从而更有力地领导运动前进。有些高等院校、科学研究机关和文化、卫生单位的党组织和党员已经这样做了。
    然而，还不是每个党员对于首先引火烧身的意义都有足够的认识。有的共产党员认为，“红”不是共产党员的主要问题。原因是：共产党员就是红。事实证明，入了党并非全是真红或者红透。有的褪色，有的粉红，有的还是外红里白，等等。运动中揭发出来的某些共产党员有官气、暮气、骄气，也有阔气、娇气，甚至还有其它的歪风邪气；这些共产党员不正是褪了色的或者粉红色的吗？要想真红或者红透，就要首先引火烧身，烧红烧透。
    什么是真红呢？就是不是组织上入党、思想上并未入党的假红，而是要求达到或者符合于党员标准，里里外外都是红色。在这一点上说，非党知识分子也是一样。不仅仅是入了党才算红，就是没有入党，只要是努力用党员标准来衡量自己和使自己达到党员标准也是红。这样的红，才是真正的红。
