Scientists, medical and health personnel, engineering technicians, and university professors, more than thirty in total, from the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, yesterday afternoon passed a resolution on socialist competition, initiating a grand socialist competition among all members of the Jiusan Society, members of other democratic parties, and people in the fields of science, culture, education, medicine, health, and engineering technology nationwide, to accelerate self-remolding and strive to be both Red and expert, and even Redder and more expert. Those who signed the resolution included Xu Deheng, Liang Xi, Pan Shu, Tu Changwang, Yan Jici, Huang Jiqing, Yin Zanshun, Mao Yisheng, Zhou Peiyuan, Yang Zhongjian, Pei Wenzhong, Li Jinxi, Huang Ziqing, You Guoen, Wei Jiangong, and others.

This socialist competition resolution was determined after full deliberation and multiple serious discussions. Before yesterday, on the afternoon of February 25th, the Central Committee members of the Jiusan Society in Beijing held a forum, first responding to the initiative of seventeen scientists in Shanghai to strive for expertise and redness within five years, issuing a response letter signed by Xu Deheng, Liang Xi, and nineteen others. Subsequently, on the evenings of the 26th and 27th, they held group discussions to deliberate on launching a socialist competition among the national science, culture, education, medicine, health, and engineering technology circles. Small groups often continued to meet and discuss specific competition conditions until midnight, with extremely enthusiastic spirits. After four days of full deliberation and repeated discussions, combined with the characteristics of the Jiusan Society's organization and members, they proposed five goals to strive for as competition conditions, and made a final discussion on them yesterday.

Yesterday afternoon, when discussing the draft resolution, people spoke very actively and enthusiastically, fully demonstrating the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and revolutionary drive.

Xu Deheng spoke first. He said, is the goal of "striving for 70% of the members to be leftists and middle-leftists within five years" in the goals of striving too conservative? He believes that the situation of the country and society is full of spring, and in the continuous Great Leap Forward, our self-remolding can and may be accelerated. He asked everyone to fully discuss this indicator based on the situation. Initially, everyone thought that reaching 70% was not low, but after in-depth analysis of the subjective and objective conditions for accelerating self-remolding, they unanimously agreed that it could be raised to 80%.

When discussing the second draft goal, everyone felt that it was not enough to simply mention "ensuring the completion of the national scientific and cultural undertakings plan." As a scientific and cultural worker, at the very least, this should be achieved. Now, we should adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward and add the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. We should also formulate goals and undertake the glorious task of actively promoting technological innovation according to the characteristics of the Jiusan Society's organization and members.

Regarding "learning from the advanced Soviet science and technology," Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University and a member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, said during the discussion: In the past, some people lacked confidence in learning Soviet science and technology or were perfunctory. Now, if we want to accelerate socialist construction and make a Great Leap Forward, we must sincerely, not half-heartedly, learn from the advanced Soviet science and technology. Only in this way can we learn advanced science and technology, which will help the development of science and technology in our country. After discussion, "sincerely" was added before the fourth goal, "learning from the advanced Soviet science and technology."

After the resolution was passed, many people believed that although a resolution was made, there should be organizational guarantees for implementing the five goals. After full discussion, it was decided to appoint Tu Changwang, Yan Jici, Mao Yisheng, Zhang Xiti, Jin Kemu, Sun Chengpei, Li Yi and other seven people to form a five-year work planning group for the Jiusan Society, responsible for formulating a five-year work plan for the Jiusan Society. At the same time, people who signed the resolution are required to formulate personal plans in the near future, combined with each person's specific situation, and earnestly implement them. The Central Committee and organizations at all levels of the Jiusan Society should be responsible for periodic inspections and evaluations.

### 九三学社中委中的科学家发起社会主义竞赛  加速自我改造　争取又红又专

    九三学社中委中的科学家发起社会主义竞赛
    加速自我改造　争取又红又专
    本报讯　昨天下午，九三学社中央委员中的科学家、医药卫生、工程技术界人士和大学教授三十多人，通过了一个社会主义竞赛决心书，向九三学社全体社员、各民主党派成员、全国科学、文教、医药卫生、工程技术界人士发起加速自我改造、争取又红又专、更红更专的社会主义大竞赛。在决心书上签名的，有许德珩、梁希、潘菽、涂长望、严济慈、黄汲清、尹赞勋、茅以升、周培源、杨锺健、裴文中、黎锦熙、黄子卿、游国恩、魏建功等。
    这份社会主义竞赛决心书，是他们经过充分酝酿和多次认真讨论才确定的。在昨天以前，2月25日下午，九三学社在京中央委员举行了座谈会，首先响应了上海十七位科学家争取五年内专深红透的倡议，发出了许德珩、梁希等十九人的响应书。随后，在26日和27日晚，又分组进行讨论、酝酿向全国科学、文教、医药卫生、工程技术界发起社会主义竞赛。小组开会讨论具体竞赛条件时，常常到午夜尚不休会，情绪至为热烈。经过四天来的充分酝酿和反复讨论，结合九三学社的特点提出了五项奋斗目标，作为竞赛条件，在昨天再作最后一次讨论。
    昨天下午，讨论决心书草案时，发言的人非常踊跃、热烈，充分显示出大跃进和革命干劲的精神。
    许德珩首先发言。他说，奋斗目标中“争取五年内社员中的左派和中左分子达到70％”是否保守了？他认为国家和社会的形势是满园春色，并在不断大跃进中，我们的自我改造是可以而且可能加速的。要求大家根据形势充分讨论这个指标。起初，大家认为要达到70％也不算低，但经过深入分析加速自我改造的主观、客观条件以后，一致认为可以提高到80％。
    讨论第二条奋斗目标草案时，大家认为单单提“保证完成国家科学文教事业计划”是不够的，作为一个科学文教工作者，起码应当做到这一点。现在，应当适应大跃进的形势，加上多、快、好、省的方针。还应根据九三学社组织和成员的特点，制订目标，担负起积极促进技术革新的光辉任务。
    关于“学习苏联先进科学技术”，九三中央委员、北京大学副校长周培源在讨论时说：过去，有的人对于学习苏联的科学技术是没有信心或者是敷敷衍衍的。现在，我们要加速社会主义建设，要大跃进，就必须要诚心诚意而不是三心二意的学习苏联的先进科学技术。只有这样，才能够学到先进的科学技术，才能够有助于我国科学技术的发展。经过讨论，在奋斗目标第四条“学习苏联先进科学技术”之前，加上“诚心诚意”。
    决心书通过以后，许多人认为，虽然下了决心，还应该有贯彻实行五项奋斗目标的组织保证。又经过充分讨论，决定推定涂长望、严济慈、茅以升、张席禔、金克木、孙承佩、李毅等七人，组成九三学社五年工作规划小组，负责制定九三学社五年工作规划。同时要求在决心书上签名的人，在最近期内，结合每个人的具体情况，分别制订个人规划，认真执行。九三学社中央、各级组织应负责定期检查、评比。
