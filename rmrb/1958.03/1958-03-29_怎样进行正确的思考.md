    How to Think Correctly
    Jiang Tianji

    The process of people's thinking is the process of reflecting the objective world. Whether people's thoughts, opinions, plans, and methods are correct depends on whether people correctly reflect the objective world. Subjectivists are bound to run into walls everywhere because their reflection of the objective world is wrong. Therefore, if we want to make fewer or no mistakes in our work, we must have a correct understanding of the human thought process.

    Cognition is the reflection of the objective world in the human mind. People not only have sensations, but also the ability to think. Sensory knowledge is a direct and image-like reflection of objective things, while thinking is an indirect and generalized reflection of objective things. The formation of thought is based on the direct experience people gain in the process of social practice; thinking can understand both things that can be felt and things that cannot be directly felt. Therefore, thinking reflects things indirectly. The role of thinking is not to reflect the individual properties or appearance of things, but to reflect the general properties and internal connections of things. Therefore, thinking reflects things in a generalized way. In the process of thinking, we use concepts to make judgments about the object of knowledge and reason based on the judgments that have been formed. The thinking process is the process of forming concepts, making judgments, and reasoning.

    What is a concept? A concept is a thought that considers a specific object, but it does not make judgments about these objects. Concepts are formed in the process of social practice. In social production, people compare many individual objects with each other and discover that there are certain common properties among them. Thus, people simplify this set of defined properties to form a universal concept. For example, iron, copper, and tin are objects suitable for certain uses in production, and they have some common properties: hardness, opacity, solubility, and luster. Therefore, people distinguish this set of defined properties as attributes of the concept of "metal" and form the universal concept of "metal." However, as people's understanding of these objects deepens, they may notice that certain other properties are more essential and truly decisive, so the attributes contained in this concept will gradually change. We have different concepts at different stages of cognitive development.

    Concepts can be correct or incorrect. If a concept's set of attributes is a reflection of the essential aspects of the object, and therefore applies to all individual objects of the same kind, and can distinguish them from all other objects, then the concept is correct. Conversely, the concept is incorrect, such as "state," "society," and "class" in bourgeois social science. In addition, concepts such as "god," "soul," and "unicorn" are also incorrect because the objects referred to by these concepts do not actually exist. Correct concepts are the basis for us to correctly understand objective objects (judgments) and construct scientific theories (reasoning).

    With a universal concept, we can apply this concept to understand individual objects, that is, to understand them through the concept. This forms some judgments. For example, "this piece of iron is metal," "this tree is a pine tree," "someone is a rightist," etc., these are all basic judgments in the cognitive process. Here, the object of judgment indicated by the subject is individual, and the knowledge about the object indicated by the predicate is general. These judgments all assert that some general property exists in a single object. If the object of judgment actually has the properties considered by the predicate, then the judgment is a true judgment. Conversely, it is a false judgment. A false judgment is either that the object of judgment does not have the properties considered by the predicate, or that the object of judgment that is supposed to actually exist does not exist. An example of the former: "There is freedom of the press in the United States"; an example of the latter: "God is omniscient and omnipotent."

    From this, it can be seen that to understand an object is to make a judgment about it using concepts. The truth or falsity of a judgment depends on whether people's understanding (judgment) conforms to the actual situation of the object of judgment. It is not easy to have a correct understanding of objective things and to be able to make true judgments about them. This requires two conditions: First, the concepts we use should be correct and clear. For example, "There is freedom of the press in the United States," "Britain practices socialism when the Labour Party is in power," if people have correct concepts about "freedom of the press" and "countries that practice socialism," they will not make such judgments. Secondly, it is difficult for people to make appropriate judgments when they do not have clear concepts. For example, when dealing with rightists, we must be able to appropriately make judgments such as "someone's circumstances are serious," "someone's circumstances are relatively minor," "someone's attitude is bad," "someone is willing to repent," etc. We must have a clear understanding of the concepts we use. Second, we must conduct investigations, research, observations, and experiments on the object of judgment to clarify the actual situation of the object before we can make true and appropriate judgments about it. For example, when judging "someone is a rightist," we must have a clear understanding of the concept of "rightist" and also grasp the person's situation. This is very clear. Only when both conditions are met can we make true and appropriate judgments about individual objects. As far as basic judgments are concerned, having correct and clear concepts (which are ultimately formed on the basis of investigation, research, or observation and experimentation), and investigation and research on the object of judgment, can form true judgments that reflect objective reality. However, in order to confirm the truth of this judgment, it is often necessary to conduct a review, and our judgment must be repeatedly tested in practice.

    The deepening and development of understanding, and repeated recognition of individual objects, enable people to make more complex judgments, judgments about an entire class of objects. For example, "iron is metal," "all whales are mammals," "bourgeois rightists are counter-revolutionaries," etc., are all such judgments. These judgments are different from basic judgments in that their subjects and predicates are universal concepts. These judgments express scientific laws and are formed on the basis of judgments about individual objects.

    As mentioned above, people use concepts to make judgments about individual objects, and the truth or falsity of these basic judgments can often be directly tested without inference. However, the confirmation or refutation of general laws must go through a process of reasoning in order to derive judgments about individual things, and then resort to practical testing.

    The reasoning process is the process of obtaining new knowledge based on existing knowledge. People use already formed judgments to reason and can draw new judgments. The former is called the premise of reasoning, and the latter is called the conclusion of reasoning. For example, from the two premises "copper is metal" and "all metals are conductors," the conclusion "copper is a conductor" is logically derived. This is reasoning. In this reasoning, if it is admitted that both premises are true, it must be admitted that the conclusion is also true. When people apply already formed general laws or scientific hypotheses to special occasions, they are reasoning. The example we cited above is such a reasoning. This form of reasoning is very basic and very important. The important task of this reasoning in the cognitive process is not to draw new and completely reliable conclusions from absolutely correct truths. Its most important role is to test the truth or falsity of the judgments that serve as premises. It is in such occasions: at least the truth of one premise is still uncertain, this premise is usually called a hypothesis, and the conclusion drawn from the premise is a judgment that can be directly tested by practice. If the conclusion is indeed consistent with the actual situation, it can be regarded as a confirmation of the hypothesis.

    Above, we have briefly explained these links: how people form concepts in the process of cognition, use concepts to make judgments about individual things, form general laws on the basis of these basic judgments, and apply general laws to specific occasions, that is, to reason. The sum of these links is the thinking process, which is the process by which people acquire knowledge and form science. It is also the process of "from the masses, to the masses."

    Practice is the basis of cognition. Any knowledge or science comes from the practice of the people, from the struggle for production and the class struggle, or from the observations and experiments of scientific workers. Because all concepts and scientific laws are based on the raw materials (sensory knowledge) and semi-finished products (such as judgments about individual things) obtained in the process of social practice and processed in the human mind. Cognition is "a series of abstract processes, that is, the process of constructing and forming concepts, laws, etc." (Lenin). These concepts, laws, etc. are reflections of the universal laws of the objective world. Without the struggle of the people to transform the objective world, that is, the struggle for production (including scientific experiments) and the class struggle, it would be impossible to expose the laws of objective things and processes; without absorbing and generalizing the experience of the people's struggle, it would be impossible to form concepts and laws.

    Practice is also the criterion for testing the truth of cognition. Whether it is a basic judgment about a specific situation, a scientific hypothesis, or a general law, it must be tested and even repeatedly tested in practice to confirm its truth. Cognition formed on the basis of social practice and tested in social practice can correctly reflect the world that exists outside the human brain. However, it is very difficult to avoid mistakes or make fewer mistakes in the cognitive process, and to reflect it more correctly. This is because, as far as the objective world is concerned, specific things are constantly changing and developing. Every thing has an infinite number of aspects and has various relationships with other things. Not only that, but these relationships between things are also general and universal, and each thing is connected to every other thing. Therefore, the recognition of a thing is an infinite process of revealing new aspects, relationships, and so on. Moreover, as far as thinking is concerned, to understand specific things, we must use concepts. However, concepts have limitations and the possibility of deviating from reality. The reflection of things in thought is not a simple, direct, and complete reflection; cognition is not an activity that is completed once. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct repeated investigations in practice to form relatively correct concepts and judgments; it is also necessary to conduct repeated tests in practice to confirm the correctness of these ideas. Correct thought is the thought that conditionally and approximately reflects the specific situation of objective things or the laws of the objective world.

    With correct thought, that is, correct concepts, true judgments, and scientific theories, it is also necessary to have correct methods of expression to convey these ideas to others so that others can understand and accept them, so that ideas can be turned into practical actions. This is the process of "going to the masses." In this process, it is necessary to use the laws of formal logic.

    Thought and language are inseparable. Correct concepts must be expressed with appropriate words, true judgments must be expressed with appropriate sentences, and scientific theories require even more correctness in the way they are expressed. The unity of concept and word is logically called a noun (or term), the unity of judgment and sentence is called a proposition, and the combination of propositions is called an argument. Logic has the following basic requirements for nouns, propositions, and arguments.

    First, the nouns and propositions used in the same argument should be definite. That is to say, the same word should express the same definite concept when it appears repeatedly in the argument, and the meaning of the words used should not be intentionally or unintentionally changed. Every sentence in an argument should express a definite judgment, and there should be no sentences that are ambiguous or equivocal (using puns).

    Second, our argument should not be self-contradictory. That is to say, two mutually contradictory propositions should not appear in the argument, one of which negates what the other affirms. It should not affirm what the object is, and then explicitly or implicitly negate the original judgment. Violating this requirement commits the fallacy of self-contradiction.

    Finally, not only should the nouns and propositions that appear in the argument be definite, and the various propositions should not be mutually contradictory, but also there should be a correct or necessary connection between the various propositions, and the argument should be logical. That is to say, the point of view to be defended in the argument should be a conclusion derived from true premises according to logical laws. Such an argument has logical rigor (accuracy).

    The above points are the basic requirements for methods of expression. Only when these requirements are met can people obtain more correct methods of expression, can people's arguments be clear, non-contradictory, orderly, and argumentative, and can people's arguments be relatively accurate or rigorous in logic. Such an argument has irresistible persuasiveness, is easy for others to understand and accept, and is easy to have an impact on the masses. Conversely, if these requirements are violated, our argument will be chaotic, unclear, self-contradictory, and lacking in reasons. In this way, it is difficult to achieve the desired effect in the communication process, and it is difficult to be convincing. From this, it can be seen that it is not enough to just have correct ideas, it is also necessary to have a more correct method of expression, and to be able to convey these ideas to others with a more accurate argument. The process of forming ideas and the process of communicating ideas, the process of "from the masses, to the masses," are all very important, and correct methods of cognition and correct methods of expression are not to be ignored.

    怎样进行正确的思考
    江天骥
    人们进行思考的过程，就是对于客观世界的反映过程。人们的思想、意见、计划和办法是否正确，就是决定于人们是否正确地反映客观世界。主观主义者必然要到处碰壁，就是因为他们对于客观世界的反映是错误的。因此，如要在工作中少犯或者不犯错误，那就必须对于人的思惟过程有一个正确的认识。
    认识是人对客观世界的反映。人不仅有感觉，也能够思考。感性认识是客观事物的直接的形象的反映，思维则是客观事物的间接的概括的反映。思想的形成以人在社会实践过程中所获得的直接经验为基础；思维既能够理解那些可以感觉到的东西，也能够理解那些不能直接感觉到的东西。所以思维对事物的反映是间接的。思维的作用不在于反映事物的个别性质，事物的外貌，而在于反映事物的一般性质，事物的内在联系。所以思维对事物的反映是概括的。在思维过程中我们使用概念对于认识对象下判断，并且根据已经形成的判断进行推理。思维过程就是形成概念、判断和进行推理的过程。
    甚么是概念呢？概念是一个思想，它所思考的是确定的对象，但是它没有对这些对象下判断。概念是在社会实践的过程中形成的。在社会生产中，人们把许多个别对象互相比较，发现它们当中存在着某些共同的性质。于是人们把这一组确定的性质简括起来，形成了一个普遍概念。例如铁、铜、锡，这些对象适合于生产上的某种用途，它们具有一些共同的性质：刚硬，不透明，可溶解，有光泽。于是，人们就把这一组确定的性质区分出来，作为“金属”概念的属性，形成了“金属”这个普遍概念。但是对于这些对象的认识愈益深刻了，人们也许会注意到某些别的性质是更本质的，真正具有决定性的，于是这个概念所含有的属性就会逐渐发生变化。在不同的认识发展阶段，我们有了不同的概念。
    概念有正确的同不正确的之分。如果概念的一组属性是对象的本质方面的反映，因而适用于同类的一切个别对象，能够把它们同一切其余的对象区别开来，这个概念就是正确的。反之，这个概念就是不正确的，例如资产阶级社会科学中的“国家”、“社会”、“阶级”等。此外，例如“神”、“灵魂”、“独角兽”等，也是不正确的概念，因为这些概念所指的对象并不是实际存在的。正确的概念是我们正确地认识客观对象（判断）和构成科学理论（推理）的基础。
    有了普遍概念，我们就可以应用这个概念去认识个别对象，就是说，通过概念去理解它。这样就形成一些判断。例如，“这块铁是金属”，“这树是松树”，“某人是右派分子”，等等，这些都是认识过程中的基本判断。在这里，用主词来指示的判断对象是个别的，用谓词来指示的关于对象的知识是一般的。这些判断都断定某种一般的性质存在于单个对象之中。如果判断对象实际上具有谓词所思考的性质，那末这个判断便是真判断。反之，它便是假判断。一个假判断或者是判断对象并不具有谓词所思考的性质，或者是被设想为实际存在着的判断对象并不存在。前者的例：“美国有新闻自由”；后者的例：“神是全知全能的”。
    由此看来，认识一个对象就是运用概念对它下判断。判断的真假决定于人们的认识（判断）同判断对象的实际情况是否符合。要对于客观事物有正确的认识，要能够对于它作出真的判断，不是容易的。这首先要具备两方面的条件：第一，我们所运用的概念应该是正确的和明确的。例如，“美国有新闻自由”，“英国在工党执政时是实行社会主义的”，如果人们有了关于“新闻自由”、“实行社会主义的国家”的正确概念，他们就不会作出这样的判断了。其次，人们在没有明确的概念时也难于作出恰当的判断。例如在处理右派分子时，我们要能够恰当地作出“某人情节严重”、“某人情节较轻”、“某人态度恶劣”、“某人愿意悔改”等等判断，我们就必须对自己所使用的概念有明确的认识。第二，我们对于判断对象还要进行调查研究、观察实验，弄清楚对象的实际情况，才能够对它作出真的恰当的判断。例如在判断“某人是右派分子”时，我们既要对“右派”的概念有明确的认识，又要掌握某人的情况，这是很明白的。必须这两个条件都具备了，我们才能够给个别对象作出真的恰当的判断。就基本的判断来说，有了正确的明确的概念（这个概念归根结底又是在调查研究或观察实验的基础上形成的），以及对于判断对象的调查研究，就能够形成反映客观实际的真判断了。但是，为了确证这个判断的真理性，往往还要进行复查，我们的判断还要在实践中受到反复检验。
    认识的深化和发展，对个别对象的认识经过多次的反复，使人们能够作出更复杂的判断，关于整整一类对象的判断。例如，“铁是金属”，“所有的鲸都是哺乳动物”，“资产阶级右派是反革命派”等等，便都是这样的判断。这些判断同基本判断有别，它们的主词和谓词都是普遍概念。这些判断表述了科学的规律，是在关于个别对象的判断的基础上形成的。
    上面已经谈过，人们运用概念来对个别对象下判断，这些基本判断的真假，往往可以不必通过推理便直接被检验了。但是，一般规律的证实或否证，就必定要通过一个推理的过程，以便推出关于个别事物的判断，然后诉诸实践的检验。
    推理过程是根据已有的知识得出新的知识的过程。人们运用已经形成的判断来进行推理，可以得出新的判断。前者叫做推理的前提，后者叫做推理的结论。例如从“铜是金属”和“所有的金属都是导电体”这两个前提，便逻辑地得出“铜是导电体”的结论。这就是推理。在这个推理中，如果承认两个前提都是真的，就必定要承认结论也是真的。当人们把已经形成的一般规律或科学假说应用于特殊场合，他们就是在进行推理。我们上面所举的例子，就是这样的推理。这种推理形式是很基本的，很重要的。这种推理在认识过程中的重要任务，并不是要从绝对正确的真理中得出新的完全可靠的结论。它的最重要的作用，倒在于检验作为前提的判断的真假。就是在这样的场合：至少有一个前提的真理性是还未确定的，这个前提通常叫做假说，而从前提得出来的结论则是可以由实践来直接检验的判断。如果结论确是和实际情况相符合，就可以看做是假说的证实。
    上面我们已经简单地阐明了这些环节：人们在认识过程中怎样形成概念，运用概念对个别事物下判断，在这些基本判断的基础上形成一般规律，以及运用一般规律于具体场合、即进行推理。这些环节的总和就是思维过程，就是人们获得知识和形成科学的过程。也就是“从群众中来”的过程。
    实践是认识的基础，任何知识或科学都是来自人民群众的实践中、来自生产斗争和阶级斗争中、或者来自科学工作者的观察实验中。因为一切概念和科学规律，都是以社会实践过程中所获得的原料（感性认识）和半成品（例如关于个别事物的判断）为基础而在人的头脑中加工制成的。认识就是“一系列的抽象过程，即概念、规律等等的构成、形成过程”（列宁）。这些概念、规律等等是客观世界的普遍规律性的反映。如果没有人民群众改造客观世界的斗争，即生产斗争（包括科学实验）和阶级斗争，就不可能暴露客观事物、过程的规律性；如果不吸取、概括人民群众的斗争经验，就不可能形成概念和规律。
    实践也是检验认识的真理性的标准，无论是关于具体情况的基本判断，还是科学假说和一般规律，都要通过实践的检验乃至反复检验，才能证实它们的真理性。在社会实践的基础上形成的、并且在社会实践中受到检验的认识，是能够正确地反映存在于人脑之外的世界的。但是，要在认识过程中不犯错误或少犯错误，要反映得比较正确，是很不容易的。这是因为就客观世界方面说，具体事物是在不断地变化着和发展着的。每个事物都具有无限多的方面，并且同其他事物有多种多样的关系。不仅如此，事物间的这些关系还是一般的，普遍的，每个事物是同其他的每个事物联系着的。因此，对一个事物的认识，就是揭露新的方面、关系等等的无限过程。并且，就思维方面说，要理解具体事物，必须运用概念。但是，概念是有局限性的，而且有脱离实际的可能。事物在思想中的反映，并不是简单的、直接的、完全的反映；认识并不是一次就完成的活动。因此，必须在实践中经过反复的考察，才能形成比较正确的概念、判断；也必须在实践中经过反复的检验，才能证实这些思想的正确性。正确的思想就是有条件地近似地反映着客观事物的具体情况或客观世界的规律性的思想。
    有了正确的思想，即正确的概念，真的判断和科学的理论，还必须有正确的表达方法，把这些思想传达给别人，以便别人了解和接受，以便把思想变成实践的行动，这就是“到群众中去”的过程。在这个过程中，需要运用形式逻辑的规律。
    思想和语言是不可分的，正确的概念要用恰当的语词来表达，真的判断要用合适的句子来表达，科学的理论更要求表达方式的正确性。概念和语词的统一体在逻辑上叫做名词（或词项），判断和句子的统一体叫做命题，命题的组合叫做议论。对于名词、命题和议论，逻辑上有以下一些基本的要求。
    首先，在同一议论过程中所使用的名词和命题应当是确定的。就是说，同一语词在议论中反复出现时应当表达同一确定的概念，不得有意地或无意地变换所用语词的涵义。在议论中每一个句子都应当表达一个确定的判断，不得有意义不明确的或模棱两可的（使用双关语的）句子。
    其次，我们的议论不应当是前后矛盾的。这就是说，在议论中不应当出现两个互相矛盾的命题，其中一个否定了另一个所肯定的东西。不应当既肯定对象是什么，接着又明显地或隐含地否定了原来的判断。违反这个要求，就犯了自相矛盾的错误。
    最后，不仅在议论中出现的名词和命题应当是确定的，各个命题不应当是彼此矛盾的，而且各个命题之间要有正确的或必然的联系，议论应当具有逻辑性。这就是说，在议论中所要辩护的论点应当是由真的前提按照逻辑规律得出来的结论。这样的议论就是具有逻辑的严格性（准确性）的。
    以上这几点是表达方法上的基本要求。只有满足了这些要求，人们才得到比较正确的表达方法，人们的议论才是明确的、无矛盾的、有条理的和有论证的，人们的议论才是在逻辑上比较准确的或严格的。这样的议论才具有不可抗拒的说服力，容易为别人所理解和接受，容易在群众中发生影响。反之，如果违反了这些要求，我们的议论就是混乱的，不明确的，自相矛盾的，缺乏理由的。这样，在传达过程中就很难收到预期的效果，就难以令人信服。由此看来，仅仅有了正确的思想，这还不够，还必须有比较正确的表达方法，能够用比较准确的议论把这些思想传达给别人。思想的形成过程和思想的传达过程，“从群众中来”的过程和“到群众中去”的过程，都是很重要的，正确的认识方法和正确的表达方法都是不容忽视的。
