    Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute of the Ministry of Coal Industry
    Sparks Anti-Waste Fire Through On-Site Inspection Points

    (Our newspaper's reporter Mu Yang reports) On-site inspections can both expose wasteful acts and unearth the roots of waste. This is the conclusion reached by the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute of the Ministry of Coal Industry from its practice.

    In the initial stage of the anti-waste campaign, many technicians at the Coal Mine Design Institute lacked confidence, and the leadership was also uncertain, unsure of where to start. After research by the institute's administrative leaders and rectification leadership, it was decided to go to the production and construction sites to discover problems. In January, they organized 28 technicians, including the president and deputy chief engineer, to visit the Dattai vertical shaft in western Beijing, which was under construction. At that time, these people still did not think there would be much waste to oppose, so some brought many design codes and foreign design materials, preparing to argue; others focused solely on the negative aspects, preparing to unilaterally reduce project investment.

    The on-site inspection yielded a completely opposite answer. The tunnel connecting the workers' bathroom to the Dattai mine shaft only needed to be built as a well-insulated above-ground corridor based on Beijing's climate conditions. However, the person in charge of the design copied foreign design standards and used an underground tunnel. The coal conveyor belt corridor designed by the construction section had brick walls and a reinforced concrete structure for the corridor roof. On-site inspection proved that changing to a lightweight structure would not affect production safety. In addition, many other wasteful phenomena were exposed.

    According to preliminary statistics, the waste reached more than 13.1% of the original total investment. This figure surprised many people and they began to admit that there was a lot of waste to oppose, and actively explored the ideological roots of the waste. Engineer Zhu Chuanhua, who was in charge of designing mine air doors and belt conveyors, did not understand the actual needs of the site in his design, and often started from personal gain, fearing that he would be held responsible for accidents. He intentionally designed according to higher safety factors. After going to the site this time and seeing the waste he had caused with his own eyes, he examined his erroneous thinking. After returning to the office, he immediately posted a big-character poster, asking everyone to help him examine himself. More people felt that this on-site inspection was the best "object lesson" for them. After the on-site inspection, Engineer Zhu Chuanhua proposed a new plan for building belt conveyors in the future. The new plan changed the walls to railings and the roof to asbestos tiles. This would save 25% to 50% of the investment compared to the original heavy structure. For all projects where waste could be recovered, the leadership also immediately took emergency remedial measures. In this way, a total of 1.15 million yuan of waste could be recovered from the Dattai shaft.

    The results of the on-site inspection at Dattai Shaft were like a spark, quickly igniting the flames of the anti-waste campaign throughout the design building. The entire institute organized 25 rescue teams, and hundreds of people worked day and night, without resting on Sundays. According to statistics, after the anti-waste campaign began, nearly 30 million yuan of existing waste and more than 50 million yuan of recoverable waste were uncovered by this institute, most of which were uncovered after this.

### 煤炭工业部北京煤矿设计院  通过现场检查点起反浪费之火

    煤炭工业部北京煤矿设计院
    通过现场检查点起反浪费之火
    本报讯　记者穆扬报道：现场检查，既可以揭露浪费事实，又可以挖掘造成浪费的根源。这是煤炭工业部北京煤矿设计院从实践中得出的结论。
    在反浪费运动的最初阶段，煤矿设计院的许多技术人员，信心不足，领导上也心中无数，不知究竟应该从何着手。经过院的行政领导和整风领导机构的研究，决定到生产和施工现场去发现问题。1月间，他们就组织了包括院长和副总工程师在内的二十八名技术人员，来到了正在施工的京西大台竖井。当时，这些人仍然不认为会有多少浪费可反，因而有人带来了许多设计规程和国外的设计资料，准备与人争辩；还有人单从消极的方面着眼，准备片面地削减工程的投资。
    经过现场检查，得出了完全相反的答案。大台矿井连接工人浴室的通道，本来根据北京的气候情况，只需要修成保温条件较好的地面走廊就行了，但是主管设计人员却生搬国外设计标准，采用了地下隧道。建筑科设计的运煤皮带的走廊，两壁是砖，廊顶是钢筋混凝土结构。现场检查的结果证明，改用轻型结构并不会影响生产安全。此外，还揭发了许多其他浪费现象。
    据初步检查统计，浪费达原投资总数的13.1％以上。这个数字使很多人大吃一惊，开始承认大有浪费可反。并积极挖掘浪费的思想根源。主管设计矿井风门和皮带走廊的朱传华工程师，因为在设计中不了解现场的实际需要，主观上又常从个人得失出发，怕出了事故担不起责任，便有意地按照更高的安全系数去设计。这次到现场去亲眼看到自己所造成的浪费以后，检查了自己的错误思想，回到机关后，马上贴了大字报，要大家帮助他进行检查。更多的人都认为这次现场检查，是给他们上的一堂最好的“实物教学”课。朱传华工程师在现场检查后就提出了今后建筑皮带走廊的新方案。新的方案，把两壁改为栏杆，棚顶改为石棉瓦。这比原来的重型结构要节省投资25％到50％。凡是能够挽回浪费的工程，领导上也都立即采取了紧急挽救措施。这样大台井总共可挽回浪费一百一十五万元。
    大台井现场检查的结果，就像一颗火种，使反浪费的烈火迅速烧遍整个设计大楼。全院先后组织了二十五个抢救队，数百人夜以继日地工作，星期日也不休息。据统计，这个院从反浪费运动开始后揭发出来的近三千万元的既成浪费事实，五千多万元可抢救的浪费现象，绝大部分是在这以后揭发出来的。
