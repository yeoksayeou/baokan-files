    Seven Days and Nights in Shanzhai
    Liao Xiying

    In the spring of 1931, more than 20,000 White bandit troops launched a frantic "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Youjiang Revolutionary Base Area in Guangxi. Our Red Seventh Army's Twenty-first Division adopted the strategy of "breaking up the whole into parts" to carry out guerrilla warfare. At that time, the main force of our battalion had already moved to Donglan, leaving only twelve of us in the Baile area of Fengshan County to persist in the struggle.

    On the evening of the second day after the Zhuang people's "Black Paper Festival" in the third month of the lunar calendar, I led this small unit to transfer to Xuehuo Shanzhai. This village was located on top of a high, narrow, and long stone mountain. The east, south, and north sides were all cliffs more than ten zhang high, with the Baile River surrounding the base of the cliffs. Only in front of the southwest-facing gate of the village was there a mountain ridge as wide as the back of an ox, connecting it to the outside small hillside like a rope. To get to the mountain village, one had to pass through two outer gates first, and then climb a bamboo ladder more than two people tall to reach the mountainside.

    The neighboring Zhuang people had all moved to this village. As soon as we arrived, they welcomed us as if we were their own relatives.

    The next day, more than a thousand White bandit troops heavily surrounded the mountain village. With the help of the Zhuang villagers, we intensified our efforts to build fortifications.

    On the third night, because the first gate was too threatened by the enemy, we were forced to retreat to the top of the cliff, where we held on to the dangerous terrain between the cracks in the rocks. When transferring positions, Deputy Company Commander Liao Yuanqiu was at the rear. Just as he was about to pull up the bamboo ladder to climb up, the enemy set it on fire below. The raging fire illuminated the mountain village, and the gate was burned open. Several enemies carried a bamboo ladder and pounced towards the cliff under the village. Liao Yuanqiu and his comrades fired fiercely, knocking them down. Immediately afterwards, another group of bandits rushed over, using the smoke from the explosion and intense firepower as cover to erect the bamboo ladder to climb up the village. Two enemies were shot down after climbing only one meter. Seeing that the third one was about to climb up, Liao Yuanqiu rushed forward, raised his rifle butt, and knocked the guy down. Just as Liao Yuanqiu was about to pull up the bamboo ladder, a burst of intense gunfire rang out from the opposite side. A bullet hit him directly in the chest. This nineteen-year-old young Red Army commander closed his eyes before he could even say a word.

    Unable to attack the mountain village, the enemy viciously resorted to a long-term siege, intending to starve us to death. The water in the village was gone. There was no spring water on top of the stone mountain, and the small path to the river for water was tightly blocked by the enemy. People chewed on the dry rations, gazing at the clear blue sky, but there wasn't a single cloud in the sky. Water! Water! My heart felt as if it was being burned by a raging fire.

    Food Commissioner Luo Wenbiao brought food again. It was still fried rice and preserved pork fat. Everyone was extremely hungry, but they couldn't swallow it when they put it in their mouths.

    Suddenly, a white-haired Zhuang old woman staggered along the trench. She leaned on a crutch with her right hand and carried a bamboo tube in her left. She walked up to me and put the bamboo tube in my arms, saying, "This is the river water I hid a few days ago. My grandchildren were crying from thirst, but I couldn't bear to part with it... Fighting is important. You share it and moisten your throats."

    "This won't do. We are young and strong and can endure it. We must take care of the elderly and children first." I insisted that she take it back.

    "What are you talking about? It doesn't matter if we, who are fine, are a little thirsty. If you don't have water to drink, you can't fight. Leave it to me!"

    There was no way, so I accepted the water. But no one drank a drop of it. The tube of water remained untouched. After Luo Wenbiao helped the old woman back, I ordered a soldier to return it.

    Late at night, I went to check the village everywhere. Walking to the thatched shed in the village, I saw Liao Xunxian, Ban Rimei, and militiamen Liao You and young woman Long Erimei, busily rummaging through a pile of homespun cloth. I fiddled with it and saw that more than a hundred pieces of homespun cloth were connected together, with a stone tied to one end. Liao You said to me, "This is what the Land Commissioner came up with. This method is sure to work!" A moment later, I followed them to the cliff on the northeast side of the village. When we reached the edge of the cliff, everyone quietly placed the end of the homespun cloth with the stone tied to it into the river. After the cloth was completely submerged, we pulled it up and squeezed the water absorbed by the cloth into a bucket. We put it down, pulled it up, and repeated this several times, finally squeezing out a bucket of water.

    Unexpectedly, the enemy quickly discovered this method. One time, as everyone was pulling up the cloth, they suddenly felt that the weight of the cloth was different from before. When they pulled it up, they saw that a section of the cloth had been cut off by the enemy with a knife. Liao You stomped his feet in anger: "What's the use of these few drops of water? If this continues, everyone will die of thirst!" Then he picked up the remaining homespun cloth and said: "Okay, I'll die alone!" He jumped into a crevice in the rock wall more than ten zhang high. This crevice was closer to the river surface, and the enemy couldn't climb over to this side to destroy it, but there was no place to hide. The enemy constantly searched this side with flashlights from the opposite bank. After a while, the light shone on Liao You and stopped, and bullets flew towards Liao You with a "whoosh—whoosh—whoosh" sound. We immediately aimed our rifles at the enemies on the opposite bank to provide cover for Liao You. This young man Liao You was truly brave and alert. In no time, he came up with a bundle of wet cloth.

    We persisted for two more days. An even more serious problem arose: bullets were running out, and even the stones were almost used up. It was impossible to hold on like this, so we thought of breaking through. As soon as the word was spoken, the mountain village was in turmoil. Some Zhuang villagers said, "If you want to leave, you can't leave us behind!" Others said, "Comrades, don't worry about us, break through quickly!" Listening to these words, my heart felt like it was being cut with a knife. I quickly said, "Comrades, villagers, we live together and die together! If we are to break through, we must do it together. Everyone calm down and think of a solution."

    Breaking through was certain. But how to break through, and from where? Just as everyone was racking their brains, a young man suddenly said, "If a cloth rope can draw up water, can't it lower people?" "That's right! That's right!" Someone immediately echoed. The young man then explained his idea: "The river water on the southwest side is shallower, and the cliff is easier to descend. There is a small hillside on the opposite side. As long as we get to the opposite bank, there is hope."

    Everything was ready. After it was completely dark, we began to move, with the Red Army soldiers in front, the masses in the middle, and the militiamen in the rear. People grabbed the large cloth rope and began to slide down...

    The sound of the "whooshing" waterfall masked our movements. The soldiers all came down safely. I immediately ordered a few people to act as vanguards, first crossing the river to occupy the small hillside on the opposite side. The soldiers waded across the river, while the enemy was still asleep! I breathed a sigh of relief, and it felt like a stone had been lifted from my heart.

    The people behind continued to slide down. Suddenly, a sharp voice pierced the silent night: "Who's there?"

    The enemy discovered us. They fired two shots in succession. This frightened the little children, who began to cry "wah-wah". In an instant, the crowd also became chaotic. I immediately ordered the soldiers: "Quickly break through the fire net and seize the small hillside!" At the same time, I hurriedly shouted, "Villagers, run to the right!..." In the dim starlight, all I could see was people crowding and bumping into each other in the Baile River, scrambling to cross the river.

    At first, the enemy thought we were attacking them. The enemies in the fields and behind the earth mounds were all in chaos, firing aimlessly. Soon, the enemy discovered that we were breaking through and quickly tightened the encirclement. In this way, our breakthrough team was cut off. Apart from us and forty or so villagers, the rest could not get down. We covered the villagers as we fought and ran. We ran for a long time before we got rid of the enemy.

    Later, I learned that there were still more than sixty Zhuang villagers and four militiamen left on the mountain village at that time. Militia squad leader Liao Xihe commanded the militiamen and the masses, fighting to the death with the enemy. By dawn, two militiamen had been sacrificed. When the rest saw the enemy charging up, they bravely jumped off the cliff...

    We finally broke through the enemy's encirclement and walked along the Baile River, which was stained red with the blood of the martyrs, to engage in new struggles.

    山寨七昼夜
    廖熙英
    1931年春天，白匪军两万多人向广西右江革命根据地进行疯狂的“围剿”。我们红七军二十一师采取了“化整为零”的方针，开展游击战。那时我们营的主力已经开到东兰去了，凤山县的百乐地区只留下我们十二个人坚持斗争。
    旧历三月初五，正是僮族人民过罢“黑纸节”的第二天晚上，我率领着这支小部队转移到穴火寨。这寨子设在一垛高大狭长的石山顶上，东、南、北三面都是十多丈高的悬崖，崖下面环绕着百乐河；只西南方的寨门前，有条牛背那么宽的山脊，像一条绳子似地连结着外面的小山坡。要上山寨，首先必须通过外围的两道闸门，到了山腰，还得爬上一架两人多高的竹梯。
    邻近的僮族人民，都搬到这个寨上来了。我们一到这里，他们就像迎接亲人一样的接待了我们。
    第二天，一千多白匪军就把山寨重重包围起来了。我们在僮族乡亲们的协助下，加紧修筑工事。
    第三天晚上，因头一道寨门受敌人威胁太大，我们被迫退到崖壁上头去，在石缝中间据险死守。在转移阵地时，副连长廖源秋走在最后边，他刚想抽起竹梯往上爬，敌人就在下面纵起火来，熊熊的大火，把山寨照得通明，闸门被烧开了。几个敌人扛着一条竹梯，向寨头崖壁下扑来。廖源秋他们一阵猛烈射击，把他们打了下去，紧跟着又有一批匪徒猛扑过来，借着爆炸后的烟雾和猛烈的火力掩护，架起了竹梯准备爬上寨来。有两个敌人爬到一米就被打了下去，眼看着第三个快爬上来了，廖源秋一个箭步赶上去，举起枪托把那家伙捅了下去。当廖源秋正要抽起竹梯时，对面响起一阵剧烈的枪声。子弹正中他的胸部，这位十九岁的青年红军指挥员还来不及说一句话就闭上了眼睛。
    敌人攻不上山寨，就恶毒地改用长期围困的办法，想活活地困死我们。寨上的水完了。石山顶上没有泉水，通河边取水的小路，又被敌人严密地封锁着。人们咬嚼着焦干的干粮，望着那晌晴的蓝天，但天上偏偏没有一点云彩。水！水！我的心像被烈火烧着似地难受。
    粮食委员罗文彪又送饭来了，还是炒米和腊猪油。大家饿极了，可是，放到嘴里又咽不下。
    忽然，有一位白发苍苍的僮族老太太愰愰荡荡地沿着交通壕走来。她右手拄着拐杖，左手提着一只竹筒，走近我的跟前，就把竹筒塞到我的怀里，说：“这是我前几天藏下来的河水。孙子们渴的直哭，我也舍不得……打仗要紧哪，你们分着润润喉咙吧。”
    “这不成啊，我们年轻力壮的，还可以忍得住，先照顾老人和小孩要紧。”我一定要她拿回去。
    “这是什么话？我们没事的人，渴点不要紧，你们没有水喝就打不得仗，快给我留下！”
    没有办法，我把水收下了。可是谁都没有去喝这点水。这筒水原封不动地留下来，等罗文彪扶着老太太回去以后，我又命令一个战士把它送回去了。
    深夜，我到寨里各处去看看。走到寨内茅棚，只见廖训贤、班日妹和赤卫队员廖友、青年妇女龙二妹几人，正忙着翻弄一堆土布。我拨弄了一下，看到一百多块土布都连接起来了，一端还结着一块石头。廖友对我说：“这是土地委员想出来的，这办法准能行！”不一会我随他们来到寨东北的悬崖边。到了崖边，大家将土布上结有石头的一端悄悄地放到河里去。等布放完了，又把它拉上来，然后把布上吸的水往桶里挤。这样放呀，拉呀，好几趟终于挤得一桶水。
    不料这办法很快就被敌人发觉了。有一次，大家正往上拉着布，突然觉得布的重量和先前的不一样，拉起来一看，原来布被敌人用刀割断了一节。廖友气得直跺脚：“这几滴水顶什么用啊，再这样下去，大家就要渴死了！”接着他抱起剩下的土布说：“好，要死就死我一个人！”便纵身跳下丈多高的一个石壁的缝隙去。这个缝隙离河面近些，敌人又没法爬到这边来破坏，就是没有地方可隐蔽。敌人在对岸不时用电筒向这边搜索。一会儿，灯光照在廖友的身上停住了，子弹“嗖——嗖——嗖”地向廖友飞来。我们立刻也用步枪瞄准对岸的敌人射击，掩护廖友。廖友这小伙子真是勇敢又机警，不一会就抱着一捆湿淋淋的布上来了。
    我们又坚持了两天。更严重的问题又来了：子弹越来越少，连石头也快打光了。这样孤守下去是不行的，我们就想办法突围。话一说开，山寨动荡起来了。僮族乡亲们有的说：“你们要走，可不能把我们丢下啊！”有的却说：“同志们，你们不要管我们，赶快突围吧！”我听着这些话，心如刀割，忙说：“同志们，乡亲们，我们活活在一起，死死在一堆！要突围也一起突，大家安静下来，想想办法。”
    突围是肯定的了。但如何突，从哪里突？大家正在动脑筋，忽然有个小伙子说：“依我说布绳能拉上水，难道不能吊下人吗？”“对！对！”立刻有人附和着。小伙子接着说出了他的办法：“西南方的河水较浅，悬崖也好下。对面有个小山坡，只要到对岸就有希望。”
    一切都准备好了。天大黑以后，我们就行动起来，红军战士在前，群众在中，赤卫队员在后，人们抓住大布绳开始往下滑……
      “哗哗”的瀑布声掩护着我们的行动。战士们都平安地下来了。我随即命令几个人作为尖兵，先渡河去占领对面的小山坡。战士们涉水到对岸去了，而敌人还睡在梦里呢！我轻轻地吁了一口气，心上好像卸下了一块石头。
    后面的人在继续往下滑。突然，一个尖厉的声音划破了静寂的夜空：“哪个？”
    敌人发觉了。接连开了两枪。这一来吓得小娃子“哇哇”地哭起来。刹时，群众的队伍也乱了。我立刻命令战士们：“快冲出火网，抢占小山坡！”一面又急忙招呼：“乡亲们，快向右边跑！……”在蒙蒙胧胧的星光下，只看到百乐河中人挤人、人碰人的抢着渡过河去。
    开始，敌人还以为是我们进攻他们呢，田野里、土坎后的敌人都乱了，没有目标地一个劲乱打。不久，敌人就发现我们是在突围了，就迅速收缩包围圈。这样，我们突围的队伍就被切断了，除了我们和四十多个乡亲外，其余的人就下不来了。我们掩护着乡亲们边打边跑。跑了很远才摆脱了敌人。
    后来，我才知道，当时在山寨上还剩有六十多个僮族乡亲和四个赤卫队员没有下来。赤卫队班长廖熙合指挥着赤卫队员和群众，同敌人拼死战。到天亮时，有两个赤卫队员牺牲了，其余的在敌人冲上来时，英勇地纵身跳下了悬崖。……
    我们终于冲出了敌人的包围圈，沿着烈士们鲜血染红了的百乐河走去，投入了新的斗争。
