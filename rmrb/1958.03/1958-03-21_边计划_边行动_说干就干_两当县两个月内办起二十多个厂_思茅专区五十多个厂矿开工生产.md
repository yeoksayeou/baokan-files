    This newspaper reports: Within a time frame of less than two months, Liangdang County, Gansu Province, has already established twenty-three small factories. These include factories for papermaking, gold panning, pottery, and brick and tile production. As a result, the total industrial output value of Liangdang County has increased sevenfold compared to 1957, exceeding the first quarter plan for 1958 by 48%. In addition, thirty-nine factories, including iron smelting and silk production, are being actively prepared and will soon be put into production. It is estimated that a total of sixty-two factories will be built by the end of the year. At that time, there will be an average of four factories per township, which will realize the provincial party committee's requirement that local industry catch up with or exceed the total agricultural output value ahead of schedule.
    The reason why they are building factories so quickly is mainly because: (1) They have implemented the policies of "small-scale as the mainstay, decentralized construction, relying on the masses, and running factories diligently and thriftily" and "from small to large, making use of what is available, serving the countryside, and serving the development of the agricultural economy." Among the twenty-three factories and mines that have already been built, only four factories and mines invested more than 300 yuan. The other nineteen factories were invested in and built by agricultural production cooperatives (the smallest only used twelve yuan). The largest number of workers is fifteen, the smallest is three, and in general, only five or six people can start production. Under the current situation of insufficient manpower and material resources, they advocate learning technology themselves if they don't have it, drawing workers from the cooperative, being workers during slack farming seasons, and farmers during busy farming seasons. (2) They have adopted methods of mutual teaching and learning, learning and applying simultaneously, visiting and learning, and using the old to bring along the new to spread technology. Therefore, once the factory is built, it can be put into production immediately. After Yuchi Township built a lime factory first, it set an example for the whole township to build factories through visits, exchanges of experience. (3) The secretary takes the lead and the whole party mobilizes. A secretary of the county party committee is assigned to be in charge of industrial production, and the secretaries of the township party branches also attach great importance to running industry. After visiting an old farmer, Shi Wenxiao, the secretary of the Xinghua Township branch, discovered a gold mine with a good reserve.
    In the process of building factories, this county has implemented the spirit of starting from the urgent needs of the masses and serving the central work of the current countryside. Once the factories are built, they generally play a role in promoting the great leap forward in production, and are therefore warmly welcomed by the broad masses. For example, the Tie Muyie Agricultural Implement Repair and Assembly Plant in Chengguan Town has repaired more than 30 pieces of agricultural implements and promoted 9 new agricultural implements in less than half a month after its completion. The Mazhahe Explosives Factory in Zuojia Township produced more than 600 kilograms of explosives in just one week after its completion, and the cost was low and the quality was good, which solved the current difficulty of insufficient supply of explosives for water conservancy projects. After the lime factory in Yuchi Township was built, it produced more than 80,000 kilograms of lime in about ten days. The masses compiled a ditty saying: "If the drill bit is broken, there is a blacksmith, if the canal leaks, there is lime, if the tool is broken, there is an agricultural implement factory, so why worry about not having the strength to produce!"

    This newspaper reports: After formulating a five-year plan to catch up with the total agricultural output value in the development of local industry and the specific plan for this year, Simao Prefecture, Yunnan Province, is vigorously building factories at a high speed. As of March 5, fifty-five newly built and expanded factories and mines have started production. Another forty-nine are under active preparation.
    Simao Prefecture plans to build two hundred and sixty-six factories and mines this year and expand twenty-seven factories and mines. Among them, except for a very small part invested by the state, most of them are funded by the local government. The total industrial output value will increase from more than 10 million yuan last year (accounting for about 8.37% of the total industrial and agricultural output value) to 91.32 million yuan, reaching 28.82% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.
    In the process of developing local industry, Simao Prefecture has implemented the policy of serving agricultural production. After the forty-seven fertilizer factories newly built and expanded this year are put into production, they can supply agriculture with 72,840 tons of chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, and granular fertilizers every year; after the thirteen agricultural implement factories are put into production, they will supply agriculture with more than 100,000 agricultural implements this year, and trial-produce sugar presses, peanut shellers, rice milling machines, and other 25 kinds of agricultural machinery. In order to make full use of Simao's rich resources, it is also planned to mine gold, silver, copper, lead, coal, iron, and asbestos. This year, the country will produce thousands of taels of gold and dozens of tons of silver.
    In order to solve the difficulties such as insufficient labor force and technical strength, they have adopted measures such as using local experts, local tools, local masters, and local methods. At the same time, they have also sent people to the interior to study, or old factories have transferred workers to train apprentices while producing. They have also adopted methods such as signing contracts with agricultural cooperatives, drawing people from agricultural cooperatives, or organizing demobilized soldiers to participate in industrial production to solve the problem of lack of labor.

### 边计划　边行动　说干就干  两当县两个月内办起二十多个厂  思茅专区五十多个厂矿开工生产

    边计划　边行动　说干就干
    两当县两个月内办起二十多个厂
    思茅专区五十多个厂矿开工生产
    本报讯　甘肃省两当县在不到两个月的时间内，已经办起二十三个小型工厂。其中有造纸、淘金、陶器、砖灰等工厂。至此，两当县的工业总产值已比1957年增长七倍，超过1958年第一季度计划48％。另外还有炼铁、蚕丝等三十九个工厂正在积极筹建，不久即可投入生产。预计到年底，共可兴建六十二个工厂。那时，平均一个乡有四座工厂，将提前实现省委提出的地方工业赶上或超过农业总产值的要求。
    他们建厂所以这样迅速，主要是因为：（一）贯彻执行了“小型为主，分散建设，依靠群众，勤俭办厂”和“由小到大，因陋就简，面向农村，为农业经济发展服务”的方针。在已经建成的二十三个厂矿中，仅有四个厂矿投资三百多元。其他十九个工厂，都是农业生产合作社投资兴建的（最少的只用了十二元）。工人最多的十五人，最少的三人，一般的仅五、六人就可开工生产。在当前人力、物力不足的情况下，他们提倡没有技术自己学，没有工人社内抽，农闲是工人，农忙是农民。（二）采取了互教互学，边学边用，参观访问和以老带新的办法来传播技术。因此，工厂一经建成，即可投入生产。鱼池乡先建成石灰厂以后，通过参观访问，经验交流，给全乡办工厂树立了榜样。（三）书记亲自动手，全党动员。县委一个书记分工专管工业生产，各乡支部书记也很重视办工业。兴化乡支部书记史文孝在访问老农以后，就发现了一个储量较好的金矿。
    这个县在办厂过程中，由于贯彻了从群众迫切需要出发，为当前农村中心工作服务的精神，工厂一经建成，普遍起到促进生产跃进的作用，因而受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。如城关镇铁木业农具修配厂，建成不到半个月已修补各种农具三十多件，推广新式农具九件。左家乡蚂蚱河炸药厂建成仅一周，就制成了六百多斤炸药，而且成本低，质量好，解决了当前水利工程炸药供应不足的困难。鱼池乡石灰厂建成后，十天左右就生产八万多斤石灰。群众编的顺口溜说：“钎子坏了有铁匠，渠道漏水有石灰，工具坏了有农具厂，还愁啥生产没力量！”
    本报讯　云南省思茅专区在制订出五年赶上农业总产值的发展地方工业规划和今年的具体计划以后，正以高速度大力建厂。到3月5日止，已有五十五个新建、扩建厂矿开工生产。另有四十九个正在积极筹建中。
    思茅专区计划今年新建二百六十六个厂矿，扩建二十七个厂矿。其中除极少的一部分由国家投资外，绝大部分是地方自己筹资兴办。工业总产值将由去年的一千多万元（约占工农业总产值的8.37％）增至九千一百三十二万元，达到占工农业总产值的28.82％。
    思茅专区在发展地方工业的过程中，贯彻了为农业生产服务的方针。全区今年新建、扩建的四十七个肥料厂投入生产后，每年能供给农业七万二千八百四十吨化学肥料、细菌肥料和颗粒肥料；十三个农具厂投入生产后，今年将供给农业十多万件农具，并试制出榨糖机、花生脱壳机、碾米机等二十五种农业机械。为了充分利用思茅的丰富资源，还计划开采金、银、铜、铅、煤、铁和石棉等矿藏。今年内将为国家生产出数千两黄金和数十吨白银。
    为了解决劳动力和技术力量不足等困难，他们采取了用土专家、土工具、土师傅、土办法等措施，同时也派人到内地学习，或由老厂抽调工人以师傅带徒弟的方式边生产边培养。他们还采取同农业社订合同、由农业社抽人或组织复员军人参加工业生产等办法，解决了缺乏劳动力的问题。
