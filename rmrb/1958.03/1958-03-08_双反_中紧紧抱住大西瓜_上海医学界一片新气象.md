Firmly Embracing the Big Watermelon During the "Double-Anti" Campaign: A New Atmosphere in Shanghai's Medical Community

    (Reported by this newspaper) The great "Double-Anti" movement has brought a new and unprecedented atmosphere to Shanghai's medical community.

    In the rectification of the "Double-Anti" campaign, Shanghai's medical community has firmly embraced the "big watermelon" of "running health undertakings with diligence and thrift, facilitating patients' access to medical treatment, reducing state financial subsidies, improving medical quality, and improving service attitude," resolutely reforming and seriously reforming. Many hospitals have initially made achievements in this area. At the Shanghai Medical Workers' Great Rectification, Great Reform, and Great Leap Forward Conference held on the 5th, seventy-seven hospitals put forward many methods and plans to benefit patients and carry out friendly competition.

    Tongji Hospital is preparing to further implement running the hospital with diligence and thrift, reduce costs, and reduce the average cost for hospitalized and outpatient patients by 10%. The six hospitals affiliated with Shanghai First Medical College will reduce the average cost for patients by 15%. Nurses at Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital have begun to implement a system of escorting patients upon discharge. Zhongshan Hospital and others have proposed four "lights" (closing doors lightly, speaking lightly, acting lightly, and walking lightly) and four "hots" (hot dishes, hot soup, hot rice, and enthusiasm) and other measures to care for patients.

    Many senior medical personnel have personally participated in outpatient clinics. Professor Cui Zhiyi, president of the famous Zhongshan Hospital and a surgical expert, Professor Lin Zhaoshu, an internal medicine digestive disease expert, Professor Tao Shouqi, a cardiology expert, and Professor Huang Jiasi, a thoracic surgery expert, have all participated in general outpatient work. Mr. Yan Fuqing, the seventy-year-old vice president of Shanghai First Medical College, also enthusiastically stated that while doing a good job as vice president, he would participate in seeing patients in the outpatient department.

    Recently, the atmosphere of cooperation and mutual assistance between medical colleges and between medical colleges and scientific institutions has also been unprecedentedly enhanced. The Tumor Hospital affiliated with Shanghai First Medical College, the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Biology Department of Fudan University are preparing to form a tumor research team, each contributing their strengths to conquer the tumor fortress. This kind of breaking down of boundaries is a rare phenomenon in Shanghai's medical community in the past.

    “双反”中紧紧抱住大西瓜
    上海医学界一片新气象
    本报讯　伟大的“双反”运动已经给上海医学界带来了一片前所未有的新气象。
    上海医学界在这次“双反”的整改中，紧紧抱住了“勤俭办卫生事业，便利病人就医，减少国家经费补贴，提高医疗质量，改善服务态度”这个大西瓜，狠狠地改，认真地改，不少医院在这方面已经初步作出了成绩。在5日举行的上海市医学家大整大改大跃进大会上，七十七所医院又提出了许多造福病人的办法和计划，进行友谊竞赛。
    同济医院准备进一步贯彻勤俭办医院，降低成本，减低住院和门诊病人的平均费用10％。上海第一医学院附属六个医院将减低病人平均费用15％。上海第六人民医院的护士已开始实行护送病人出院的制度。中山医院等提出了四轻（关门轻、说话轻、动作轻、走路轻）和四热（热菜、热汤、热饭、热情）等关心病人的措施。
    许多高级医务人员已亲自参加了门诊，上海著名的中山医院院长、外科专家崔之义教授，内科消化病专家林兆书教授，心脏病专家陶寿琪教授，胸外科专家黄家驷教授等都参加了普通门诊工作。七十多岁的上海第一医学院副院长颜福庆老先生也热情地表示：在做好副院长工作的同时，参加门诊部看病。
    近来，医学院之间、医学院和科学机关之间合作互助的空气也空前增强了。上海第一医学院附属肿瘤医院和中国科学院实验生物研究所，以及复旦大学生物系等单位正在着手筹备组成肿瘤研究小组，各献所长，攻下肿瘤堡垒，这种打破界线是过去上海医学界中少有的现象。
