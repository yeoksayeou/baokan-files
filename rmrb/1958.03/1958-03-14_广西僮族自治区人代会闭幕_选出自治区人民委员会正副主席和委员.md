The meeting elected the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and members of the Autonomous Region People's Committee. Wei Guoqing, Chairman of the Autonomous Region, delivered the closing speech on behalf of the Presidium of the Congress. He called on people of all ethnic groups and cadres at all levels in the region to further strengthen unity, especially the unity between the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups, and to strive together to accelerate the socialist construction of the autonomous region.
