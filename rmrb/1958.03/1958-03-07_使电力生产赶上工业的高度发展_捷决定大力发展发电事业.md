Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 6th. Czechoslovakia is working hard to overcome the phenomenon of electricity production lagging behind the development of other sectors of the national economy.

The Czechoslovak Ministry of Power Industry is preparing to put 400,000 kilowatts of new power generation equipment into production this year, and plans to put 400,000 kilowatts and 500,000 kilowatts of new power generation equipment into production in 1959 and 1960 respectively. During the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), power generation equipment with a generating capacity equivalent to two large power plants will be put into production each year.

From 1948 to 1955, Czechoslovakia's industrial production increased by 225%, but electricity production only increased by 194%. Moreover, the increase in electricity production was mainly achieved by increasing the utilization rate of existing power generation equipment, with little increase in new power generation equipment. This situation has already attracted the attention of the Czechoslovak government.

Minister of Power Industry Pospíšil emphasized the importance of accelerating the development of electricity at a national conference of machine manufacturing and other enterprises related to the construction of new power plants. He pointed out that the technological development of electrification, mechanization, and automation in industry, agriculture, and transportation requires the growth rate of electricity production to exceed the growth rate of total industrial production. The increase in labor productivity, which is of decisive significance for the realization of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia, is directly determined by the increase in electricity production.

Recently, workers in Czechoslovak construction and installation enterprises have successively put forward guarantees to better and faster complete the task of building new power plants.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 6th. Czechoslovakia plans to utilize 80% of the country's hydropower resources by 1975. By 1975, the power generation of the country's hydropower stations will reach more than 8 billion kilowatt-hours.

Currently, a series of hydropower stations are being planned and started on the Danube, Váh, and Vltava rivers, which are the richest in water resources. According to the plan, 27% of the water resources will be utilized by 1960.

Czechoslovakia's hydropower resources can generate 10 to 12 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. However, in 1937 before liberation, only 3% of the hydropower resources were utilized. After liberation, with the construction of more than 20 hydropower stations, the hydropower generation in 1957 had increased to 2 billion kilowatt-hours, accounting for 20% of the actual available hydropower resources and 11.3% of the country's total power generation.

    使电力生产赶上工业的高度发展
    捷决定大力发展发电事业
    新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克正在努力克服电力生产同国民经济其它部门的发展脱节的现象。
    捷克斯洛伐克动力工业部准备在今年使四十万瓩的新的发电设备投入生产，并且计划在1959年和1960年分别使四十万瓩和五十万瓩的新的发电设备投入生产。在第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）内，每年将有相当于两座大型电力厂的发电能力的发电设备投入生产。
    从1948年到1955年，捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产增加了225％，但是电力生产只增加了194％。而且电力生产的增加主要是通过提高现有的发电设备利用率来实现的，新的发电设备增加得不多。这种情况已经引起捷克斯洛伐克政府的注意。
    动力工业部部长波斯皮希尔在一次与建设新电厂有关的机器制造等企业全国代表会议上曾经着重谈到了加速发展电力的重要。他指出，工业、农业和运输业等的电气化、机械化和自动化的技术发展，要求电力生产的增长速度必须超过工业总生产的增长速度。对实现捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设有决定意义的劳动生产率的提高，直接决定于电力生产的增加。
    最近，捷克斯洛伐克建筑和安装等企业的工人纷纷提出保证，要更好和更快地完成建设新电厂的任务。
    据新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克计划在1975年以前使全国水力资源的80％得到利用。到1975年全国水电站的发电量将达到八十亿度以上。
    目前，在水力最丰富的多瑙河、发格河和弗尔塔瓦河上正计划和开始兴建一系列的水电站。按照计划，到1960年将有27％的水力资源得到利用。
    捷克斯洛伐克的水力资源每年可以发出一百到一百二十亿度的电力。但是在解放前的1937年，被利用的水力资源只有3％。解放后，随着二十多个水电站的修建，1957年的水力发电量已经增加到二十亿度，为实际可利用的水力资源的20％，占全国总发电量的11.3％。
