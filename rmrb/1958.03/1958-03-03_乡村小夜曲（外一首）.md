    Country Serenade (and one other poem)
    Guan Hua
    The moon unfolds wings of white transparency,
    Crossing the eastern mountain peak,
    Roaming in the blue firmament.
    The black woods cast long, branched shadows on the ground,
    The distant village falls into the mist.
    Lights everywhere in the open country,
    Which are lamplight? Which are starlight?
    Which is the human world? The heavens?
    The shouts of labor come from the sky,
    Looking up at the derrick, people are treading the giant wheel,
    Like a group of gods descended from heaven.
    Turning my head sharply, the mighty motorcade is like a flood,
    Horseshoes beat on the frozen road,
    The land trembles under the roaring wheels;
    For this year's great harvest,
    Transporting mud and collecting fertilizer, never resting all night.
    Ah, a chorus of clanging iron rings,
    A chorus of voices,
    Startling the wild hare by the roadside,
    Darting out of the ditch.
    Awakening the flocks of birds in the trees,
    Flying away from the branches.
    The wild hare darts here and there with nowhere to hide,
    The flocks of birds fly here and there with nowhere to land,
    The open country is everywhere full of carts, horses, people, lights...

     Treasure-Taking
    We tread the giant wheels in the high and vast blue sky,
    As if about to spread our wings and soar towards the boundless sky…
    The wheels send the thousand-pound steel drill bit
    Into the bosom of the earth,
    Like the magic key in a fairy tale
    Opening the gate that locks away treasures;
    Let the sweet spring water gush forth,
    Flowing towards the boundless fields.
    Thus, the green waves surge,
    Wheat flowers are its spray,
    Larks are its seagulls.
    The giant wheels turn under our feet,
    The cold wind howls in our ears,
    Sweat soaks our cotton-padded coats.
    Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho,
    We sing the earth’s paean,
    Intoxicating the earth with song,
    Generously presenting its inexhaustible wealth.
  February 1958, in Fengrun County, Hebei Province

    乡村小夜曲（外一首）
    管桦月亮展开白得透明的羽翼，横过东边的山头，在蓝色的苍穹里漫游。黑色的树林在地上投下长枝的疏影，远远的村庄坠入雾中。旷野里处处灯火，哪是灯光？哪是星光？哪是人间？天上？劳动的呼喊来自空中，仰望井架，人在踩动巨轮，像似下界的一群天神。猛回头，浩荡的车队像洪流，马蹄敲着冰冻的道路，土地在轰响的车轮下颤抖；为了今年的大丰收，运泥集肥彻夜不休。啊，一片铁环的叮噹声，一片人声，惊起路边的野兔，窜出土沟。惊醒树上的鸟群，飞离枝头。野兔窜来窜去无处躲，鸟群飞来飞去无处落，旷野里处处是车马、人群、灯火……
     取　宝我们在高阔的蓝空中踩动巨大的车轮，像要展翅飞腾向着万里长空……车轮把千斤的钢钻头送入大地的胸怀，像童话中的神钥匙把关闭财宝的大门打开；让甘甜的泉水涌上来，流向无边无际的田野。于是，碧浪涛涛，麦花是它的浪花，云雀是它的鸥鸟。巨轮在脚下转动，冷风在耳边呼啸，汗水浸透棉袄。嗨哟，嗨哟，嗨哟，我们唱着大地的颂歌，使大地为歌颂所醉，豪爽地呈现出它无尽的财富。
  1958年2月于河北省丰润县
