Important Experiences from the Rectification Campaign in Central State Organs
Xi Zhongxun Delivers Report at CPPCC National Committee Rectification Meeting

Four Major Gains of the Rectification Movement: 1. Learned and Mastered New Forms of Socialist Democracy; 2. Understood the Significance of Politics as the Commander; 3. Learned the Method of the Mass Line; 4. Brought About a Great Leap Forward in National Work.

The CPPCC National Committee held a rectification report meeting on the 25th, inviting Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, to deliver a report on the rectification movement. Xi Zhongxun spoke about the basic situation of the rectification movement in the central state organs and introduced some important experiences.

The report meeting was presided over by Li Jishen, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC. More than 1,000 people attended the report meeting, including members of the CPPCC National Committee and members of various democratic parties.

Xi Zhongxun said at the meeting that the rectification movement has been going on for more than ten months. This movement is actually a revolution, a great socialist revolution in politics and ideology. Over the past ten months, the central state organs have gone through the stages of great airing of views, the struggle against the Rightists, and the rectification and improvement phase. The rectification and improvement phase has been the longest, lasting for more than five months, and is divided into two steps. The first step was general rectification and improvement, that is, clearing up all "sesame seed" problems. At that time, it was combined with the handling of Rightists, sending cadres to lower levels for labor training, criticizing typical ideas, and dealing with bad elements. The second step is the current in-depth rectification movement against waste and conservatism.

Xi Zhongxun said that in the in-depth debates and rectifications, all organs have focused on two main issues, namely, the transformation and improvement of leadership thinking and leadership style; and making all cadres understand the meaning of being "red" and "expert". Xi Zhongxun emphasized that "red" and "expert" is a fundamental issue. In the past, the biggest shortcoming in some central state organs was the lack of politics. Some organs were neither red nor white, and only emphasized work and not people. This is one of the important lessons learned in the rectification movement. Facts have proved that all cadres, including Communist Party members, need to be "red," and need to be constantly "red," and constantly carry out ideological transformation. Anyone who stops transforming will immediately be in danger of fading.

Xi Zhongxun mentioned that after more than ten months of rectification and the struggle against the Rightists, a new situation has emerged in all organs. That is, the relationship between leaders and the led in the organs has become closer, unity has been strengthened from top to bottom; the thinking of the masses has become more active, everyone is in a happy mood and full of energy; the organs have been mobilized from top to bottom, working hard and delving deeply, and a situation of a great leap forward in socialist construction has emerged. Xi Zhongxun said that this is the new situation of the socialist revolution brought about by the rectification movement. The face of all kinds of work has changed. This movement will certainly have unexpected and far-reaching effects in the future, and a greater leap forward in socialist construction will emerge. Some people do not see the benefits of rectification, are afraid of rectification, and have ideological concerns, which are all wrong.

When Xi Zhongxun recalled the development of the rectification movement in the central state organs over the past ten months, he focused on the issue of handling Rightists. He said that the Rightists in the central state organs have now been dealt with. Among these Rightists, there are non-Party members and Communist Party members. The Rightists within the Communist Party have all been expelled from the Party. This incident illustrates an important lesson: the glorious title of "Communist Party member" is by no means a guarantee. If one is not politically vigilant and does not continue to transform one's thinking, even those who have been Party members for one or two decades will still degenerate into Rightists.

He said that in the process of handling Rightists, all organs conducted full debates on issues such as whether the contradiction between the Rightists and us is an enemy-people contradiction and what principles should be followed in handling them. The work of handling Rightists is not a simple follow-up task, but a task of how to be responsible for educating and transforming the Rightists and how to turn negative factors into positive factors. Now it seems that after a combination of strictness and leniency, the vast majority of Rightists can be transformed; of course, the most important thing still depends on the efforts of the Rightists themselves. Many Rightists who are exposed within the Party, as long as they can sincerely repent and resolve to reform, will still have the opportunity to return to the Party in the future. Xi Zhongxun emphasized that the relationship between the Rightists and us is an enemy-people contradiction, but after struggle and handling, this contradiction can be transformed under certain conditions. Unless a few Rightists continue to adhere to their reactionary stance, stubbornly resist to the end, or even commit acts of violence, they are still an enemy-people contradiction with us.

Xi Zhongxun said that the rectification movement in the central state organs is still going on in depth, and some important gains and experiences have been obtained. He said that through the rectification movement, people have learned and mastered new forms of socialist democracy, which is the first important gain. Great airing of views, great debates, and writing big-character posters are new developments in the form of socialist democracy, and are good ways to solve contradictions among the people using the method of the mass line. In particular, through writing big-character posters to air views and expose shortcomings, and put forward suggestions, the masses can fully exert their political enthusiasm and initiative, and enhance their sense of responsibility as masters. The movement of writing big-character posters is also a movement to promote telling the truth, that is, to encourage people to speak their minds without any worries, saying whatever they have to say; everyone who writes a big-character poster not only says whatever they have to say, but also uses their brains to think about ways to solve the problem. In this way, as long as everything becomes the action of the masses, things will be easy to handle.

Xi Zhongxun said that we are not writing big-character posters for the sake of writing big-character posters, not airing views for the sake of airing views, not debating for the sake of debating. Our purpose is to improve work, resolve contradictions, and promote the progress of our cause. Big-character posters have great power. They use gentle and soft methods to expose shortcomings and contradictions in front of the masses, arouse the power of public opinion, and urge the correction of shortcomings and the resolution of contradictions. We must protect and promote this new form of democracy, and make it a regular form under the socialist democratic system. Now, some units in the central state organs are trying to establish big-character poster societies. A division or a section can establish a big-character poster society, so that the democratic form of big-character posters can be fixed organizationally. In the future, when there are problems, big-character posters can be written, and this form can be used to correctly resolve contradictions among the people.

Second, through this rectification, people have understood the significance of politics as the commander. Xi Zhongxun said that technology must be combined with politics. All business and technology divorced from politics have no soul. Through this rectification, many people have understood this truth. Now everyone in all walks of life, including leading cadres, general cadres, engineers, and scientists, are talking about politics. Even childcare workers, cooks, and drivers are talking about politics. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. We must oppose empty politicians, and especially oppose pragmatists who have lost their way. This is to be both "red" and "expert," and even more "red" and "expert."

Xi Zhongxun said that in 1956, we carried out the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production, and changed the relations of production; the current rectification is to further adapt the superstructure and ideology to the development of production and the situation of the great leap forward in production. Therefore, this rectification movement is another great socialist revolution. In the central state organs, this rectification has mainly solved and will solve the following major problems: First, the revolution in ideology and work style, requiring a resolute rejection of the "three winds" and "five airs," so that all cadres understand the issue of being "red" and "expert"; Second, the revolution in leadership methods and work methods, so that all cadres consciously learn new work methods, that is, the work method of the mass line; Third, the reform of organizational systems and rules and regulations, that is, to reform all organizational systems and rules and regulations that are not suitable for the development of production according to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, so that socialist construction can develop more smoothly.

Third, learning the method of the mass line is one of the important gains of the rectification movement. Xi Zhongxun said that rectification is a revolution, and the method is to adopt a mass self-ideological transformation movement. In the rectification movement, many people have learned the work method of the mass line. They believe in the majority of the masses, rely on the majority of the masses, the wisdom of the masses has enriched the leadership's thinking, and the leadership is combined with the masses. Problems that used to be piles of problems are now quickly solved, and things that were impossible to do in the past can now be done.

In the past, some leading cadres did not believe in the masses, and some central departments did not believe in the local governments. Now, the concept of relying on the masses and relying on the local governments has begun to be established. Work in all walks of life is being carried out from top to bottom and blooming everywhere. Every province, every prefecture, and every county are going all out to run industry, transportation, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings. The central departments vigorously support the local governments, which has enabled the rapid development of all undertakings of the country. Real life has proved that without relying on the masses, without relying on the local governments, and only relying on the leadership, only relying on the central government, nothing can be done well.

Fourth, the rectification movement has brought about a great leap forward in national work, which is a direct result of the rectification movement. Xi Zhongxun said that now all organs are making a great leap forward. Anyone who wants to crawl will not be able to survive. He listed the ambitious leap forward plans proposed by many central departments after airing views and debates. He said that the leap forward plans of the departments are very encouraging. With the situation of a great leap forward, the "three winds" and "five airs" have been further swept away. Now, those who want to continue to live in a dying mood have to cheer up under the impact of the situation. The rectification of all departments must be combined with the great leap forward. Only in this way can the rectification movement produce huge material power. In the process of debating the great leap forward, all organs must not only put forward the leap forward targets, but also focus on putting forward and discussing reliable measures to achieve the leap forward targets; it is wrong for some organs to only shout empty leap forward targets. It must be understood that all leap forward plans must be based on what can be achieved.

Finally, Xi Zhongxun talked about how to end the rectification. He said that after the in-depth rectification is over, a series of ideological construction work must be done. We must check and compare, and those who have half-cooked rice must make up the lessons; we must summarize the vivid experiences of the rectification movement, and formulate plans to improve and strengthen the work of the Party and League in the organs; we must mobilize cadres to study some documents, improve their thinking, and formulate personal leap forward plans. In short, the movement must achieve complete victory, and must be carried out to the end in one go. We must resolutely oppose ending the movement hastily and prevent failure at the last moment.

    中央国家机关整风的重要经验
    习仲勋在政协全国委员会整风报告会上作报告
    整风运动的四大收获：一、学会和掌握社会主义民主的新形式；二、懂得了政治是统帅的意义；三、学会群众路线的方法；四、带来了国家工作大跃进的形势
    新华社26日讯　政协全国委员会25日举行整风报告会，邀请国务院秘书长习仲勋作整风运动的报告，习仲勋在会上谈到了中央国家机关整风运动的基本情况，介绍了一些重要的经验。
    报告会由政协副主席李济深主持。出席报告会的是政协全国委员会委员、各民主党派成员，共有一千多人。
    习仲勋在会上说，整风运动已经进行了十个多月，这个运动实际上就是一次革命，是一次伟大的政治上思想上的社会主义革命。十个多月来，中央国家机关经过大鸣大放阶段、反右派斗争阶段、整改阶段。整改阶段时间最长，已经进行了五个多月，分为两个步骤，开始是一般整改，即扫清一切“芝麻”问题，当时结合进行了处理右派、下放干部劳动锻炼、典型思想批判和处理坏分子等工作；第二个步骤就是现在所进行的反浪费反保守的深入整改运动。
    习仲勋说，在深入辩论和整改中，各机关都着重抓住两个主要问题，这就是改造和提高领导思想及领导作风问题；使所有干部都懂得红与专的意义。习仲勋强调说，红与专是一个根本性的问题，过去在一些中央国家机关内最大的缺点就是缺乏政治，有些机关不红不白，只重事不重人，这是整风运动中所发掘出的重要教训之一。事实证明，所有干部包括共产党员在内，都需要红，而且要不断的红，不断地进行思想改造，任何人一停止了改造，立即就会有褪色的危险。
    习仲勋谈到，经过十个多月的整风和反右派斗争，各机关已经出现了一个新的局面，这就是机关里领导和被领导的关系密切了，上下一致，团结加强；群众的思想活跃了，大家的心情舒畅，精神振奋；机关里已经上下动员起来，干劲加钻劲，社会主义建设大跃进的形势出现了。习仲勋说，这是整风运动所带来的社会主义革命的新形势，现在各种工作的面貌都有了改变，这个运动在将来肯定地还会发生意料不到的更深远的影响，出现更大的社会主义建设的跃进。有些人看不到整风的好处，害怕整风，思想上有顾虑，这都是不对的。
    习仲勋在回溯中央国家机关十个月来整风运动发展的情况时，曾着重谈到对右派分子的处理问题。他说，中央国家机关的右派分子，现在已经处理完毕。在这些右派分子中，有非党人员，也有共产党员，共产党内的右派分子都已经全部开除出党。这件事情说明了一个重要教训：“共产党员”这个光荣的称号绝不是一张保票，如果政治上不加警惕，思想上不继续进行改造，即便有一、二十年党龄的人也还会堕落成为右派。
    他说，在处理右派的过程中，各机关对于右派是否是敌我矛盾、应按照什么原则进行处理等问题，都进行了充分的辩论。处理右派的工作不是一个简单的善后工作，而是如何对右派分子负责进行教育改造、如何把消极因素变为积极因素的工作。现在看来，经过严肃和宽大相结合的处理以后，绝大多数右派分子是可以改造过来的；当然，最主要的还决定于右派分子本人的努力。许多党内揭发出来的右派分子，只要他们能够真心悔过，决心改造，将来还是有机会回到党内来的。习仲勋强调说，右派和我们的关系是敌我矛盾，但是经过斗争和处理以后，这种矛盾是可以在一定条件下转化的。除非少数右派分子继续坚持反动立场、顽抗到底甚至行凶作恶，当然同我们仍然是敌我矛盾。
    习仲勋说，中央国家机关的整风运动现在还正在深入进行，目前已经取得了一些重要的收获和体会，他说，通过整风运动，使人们学会和掌握社会主义民主的新形式，这是第一个重要的收获。大鸣大放、大争大辩、出大字报，这是社会主义民主形式的新发展，是用群众路线的方法来解决人民内部矛盾的好方式。特别是通过大字报来大鸣大放，揭露缺点，提出建议，这就使群众充分地发挥了他们的政治积极性和主动性，提高了他们主人翁的责任感。出大字报的运动，也就是提倡说老实话的运动，就是鼓励人们毫无顾虑地说心里话，有啥说啥；每一个出大字报的人，不仅有啥说啥，还会动动脑筋，想想办法，这样，一切事情只要变成群众的行动，事情就好办了。
    习仲勋说，我们不是为出大字报而出大字报，不是为鸣放而鸣放，不是为辩论而辩论，我们的目的是为了改进工作，解决矛盾，推动我们的事业前进。大字报有巨大的威力，它用和风细雨的方法，把缺点和矛盾暴露在群众面前，唤起舆论的力量，督促改正缺点，解决矛盾。对这种新的民主形式，我们要保护它，发扬它，使它成为社会主义民主制度下一种经常的形式。现在，中央国家机关有些单位正在试办大字报社，一个司、一个处都可以成立大字报社，这样就可以使大字报这种民主形式从组织上把它固定下来，以后有了问题就出大字报，通过这种形式来正确地解决人民内部的矛盾。
    第二，通过这次整风，使人们懂得了政治是统帅的意义。习仲勋说，技术必须和政治相结合，一切业务和技术脱离了政治，就没有灵魂，通过这次整风，很多人都懂得了这个道理。现在各行各业所有的人包括领导干部、一般干部、工程师、科学家，大家都在谈政治，甚至保育员、炊事员、司机都在谈政治，这是非常可喜的现象。我们要反对空头的政治家，当前尤其要反对迷失方向的实际家，这就是要又红又专，更红更专。
    习仲勋说，我们在1956年进行了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，改变了生产关系；现在的整风，就是要进一步使上层建筑、意识形态更加适应生产的发展，适应生产大跃进的形势。所以说，这次整风运动是又一个伟大的社会主义革命。在中央国家机关里，通过这次整风主要解决了和即将解决这样一些重大的问题：第一、思想作风的革命，要求坚决反掉“三风”和“五气”，使所有干部都懂得红与专的问题；第二、领导方法的革命，工作方法的革命，使所有干部都自觉地学会新的工作方法，也就是群众路线的工作方法；第三、机构体制和规章制度的改革，这就是要使所有不适宜于生产发展的机构体制和规章制度，按照多快好省的方针来一个改革，使社会主义建设更顺利地向前发展。
    第三，学会群众路线的方法，是整风运动的重要收获之一。习仲勋说，整风是一个革命，方法又是采取群众性的自我思想改造运动。在整风运动中，许多人学会了群众路线的工作方法，他们相信了群众的多数，依靠群众的多数，群众的智慧丰富了领导思想，领导与群众相结合，过去成堆的问题，现在很快地解决了，过去办不到的事情，现在也能办到了。
    过去有些领导干部不相信群众，有些中央部门不相信地方，现在依靠群众、依靠地方的观念开始树立了，各行各业的工作都在上下一齐动手，遍地开花，每个省、每个专区、每个县都在鼓足干劲办工业、办交通事业、办商业、办文化教育事业，中央各部门大力扶助地方，这就使国家的一切事业得到了飞跃的发展。现实生活已经证明，不依靠群众，不依靠地方，仅仅由领导来办，仅仅由中央来办，什么事也是办不好的。
    第四，整风运动带来了国家工作大跃进的形势，这是整风运动的直接结果。习仲勋说，现在各机关都在大跃进，谁想爬行，他的日子就过不下去。他列举了中央许多部门经过鸣放和辩论而提出的豪迈的跃进规划。他说，各部门的跃进规划是十分鼓舞人心的，有了大跃进的形势，也就进一步扫荡了“三风”和“五气”，现在，那些想暮气沉沉继续过下去的人，在形势的冲击下不得不振作起来了。所有部门的整风，必须和大跃进结合起来，只有这样，才能使整风运动产生巨大的物质力量。在辩论大跃进的过程中，各机关不仅要提出跃进的指标，还要着重提出和讨论实现跃进指标的可靠措施；有些机关光空喊跃进指标是不对的。要懂得，一切跃进计划都必须放在可能实现的基础上。
    最后，习仲勋谈到怎样结束整风的问题，他说，深入整改结束以后，还必须作一系列的思想建设工作，要检查评比，有夹生饭的要补课；要总结整风运动生动的经验，订出改进和加强机关党、团工作的规划；要发动干部学习一些文件，提高思想，订出个人跃进的规划。总之，运动必须获得全胜，要一鼓作气进行到底，坚决反对草率收兵，防止功亏一篑。
