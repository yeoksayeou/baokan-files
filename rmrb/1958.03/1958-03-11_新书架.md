　　"Translation" Commemorates Gorky

　　This year, March 28th marks the 90th anniversary of Gorky's birth. The March issue of "Translation" features a special commemorative section. The three articles compiled and translated by Ge Baoquan, "Gorky's Letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen," "Gorky on the Path of China's Revolutionary Development," and "Gorky Responds to Soong Ching Ling's Appeal," allow readers to further understand that Gorky had been concerned with the Chinese people's liberation struggle from as early as the Boxer Rebellion against imperialism. In 1900, Gorky even wrote several letters full of passion, inviting Chekhov to come to China with him. The Soviet writer Byalikov's short essay, "The Great Lesson," briefly describes how Gorky constantly obtained the Party's leadership and support from Lenin, thereby gaining new life and fruitful results in his creation. This is an issue of particular practical significance to us today. "On Literature and Other Things" and "Paul Verlaine and the Decadents" are two of Gorky's famous essays. The former mentions that literature should actively delve into contemporary life and the attitude of critics towards literary criticism; the latter thoroughly criticizes the poisonous elements of the decadent literary trend.

　　"Sprouts" Criticizes the Fame and Gain Mentality of Amateur Young Writers

　　The fourth issue of "Sprouts," published on February 16th, reported on the degeneration of two amateur writers, the young sailor Jiang Faquan and the middle school student Yu Bingheng, and published a commentary entitled "Alarm Bell for Amateur Writers." How amateur writers should correctly treat literary creation is a noteworthy issue. Authors cannot take the bourgeois individualistic literary path, but only the working-class collectivist literary path. Amateur writers must first be diligent and responsible laborers, builders full of socialist revolutionary enthusiasm, and only then should they engage in literary creation seriously and diligently.

　　"New Port" Promotes Mini-Novels

　　The February-March issue of "New Port" is a combined special issue of novels. Lao She wrote an article "Write More Mini-Novels," hoping that everyone would write more short stories of no more than two thousand words each, and even gave this type of novel a name called "mini-novel."

　　This issue published more than ten novels, including Luo Binji's "Returning Home at Night," Wang Xiyan's "Brother Went to the Countryside," Xu Chi's novella "A Bridge Spans North and South," excerpts from Wang Lin's novel "Miner's Son," and "Old Craftsman" written by Tianjin worker-writer A Feng. Interestingly, it published a novel "Li Shaokui" by Ai Wu, a steelmaking worker, followed by Fang Ji's cordial and touching essay "A Page of Notes," in which he wrote in the subtitle: "I copied this page of notes to publish it because I saw his name again in Comrade Ai Wu's novel…".

    “译文”纪念高尔基
    今年3月28日是高尔基的诞生九十周年纪念日。三月号“译文”为此专辟了一个纪念特辑。戈宝权辑译的“高尔基给孙中山先生的信”、“高尔基论中国革命发展的道路”、“高尔基响应宋庆龄的呼吁”三篇文章使读者进一步了解高尔基远自义和团反帝运动的时候起，就时时刻刻关怀着中国人民的解放斗争。1900年时高尔基还曾以充满了激情的字句几次写信约契诃夫一起到中国来。苏联作家比亚里夫的短论“伟大的教训”，简叙了高尔基不断从列宁那里取得了党的领导和支持，从而在创作上获得新的生命和丰硕的果实。这是在今天对我们具有特别现实意义的问题。“论文学及其他”和“保尔·魏尔伦和颓废派”是高尔基的两篇著名论文。前者提到了文学应该积极地深入当代生活和批评家对待文学批评的态度问题；后者则彻底批判了颓废派这种文艺思潮的毒素。

    “萌芽”批判业余青年作者的名利思想
    2月16日出版的第四期“萌芽”上，报道了青年水手姜法泉和中学生虞炳恒两个业余写作者堕落的经过，并发表以“业余写作者的警钟”为题的评论。业余写作者应该如何正确地对待文学创作，是一个值得注意的问题。作者不能走资产阶级个人主义的文学道路，只能走工人阶级集体主义的文学道路。业余写作者首先必须是个勤恳负责的劳动者，充满社会主义革命干劲的建设者，行有余力，才严肃、刻苦地从事文学创作。　（秀）
    “新港”提倡小小说
    二、三月号的“新港”是个小说专号的合刊。老舍写了篇“多写小小说”，他希望大家多写每篇至多不超过两千字的短篇小说，还给这种小说起了个名儿叫“小小说”。
    这一期发表了骆宾基的“夜归”，王西彦的“哥哥下乡去了”，徐迟的中篇“一桥飞架南北”，王林长篇小说里的几段“矿工的儿子”和天津工人作家阿凤写的“老手艺人”等十余篇小说。有趣的是发表了一篇艾芜写的小说炼钢工人“李绍奎”，紧接着是方纪写的亲切动人的散文“一页笔记”，他在副题上写道：“我抄出这一页笔记拿来发表，是因从艾芜同志的小说里又看到了他的名子……”。　（德）
