Editorial Note:

    Welcome "Another Message to Young Readers"

    Comrade Bing Xin's essay correspondence "Another Message to Young Readers" will begin serial publication on the supplement today on an irregular basis.

    The reason for using "Another Message" is that it comes from the book "Message to Young Readers" more than thirty years ago. In 1923, "Message to Young Readers" began serial publication in the "Morning Post" supplement and was published in 1926. The author used essays full of poetic imagery to depict natural scenery, travel experiences, recollections of childhood joy and maternal love, and express her own aspirations to young readers. "Message to Young Readers" became one of the favorite reading materials for children and teenagers at that time.

    More than thirty years have passed. In these thirty years, both the young readers and the author have experienced indescribable dramatic changes. Now, just as the motherland is entering a new historical period, Comrade Bing Xin has once again picked up her pen to tell new stories of the new era to new young readers. Comrade Bing Xin is about to travel to Western Europe, and we wish her good health on her journey and that she will continue to send back more correspondence for the young readers.

    Advocating essays has been one of the goals of the supplement since its inception. Now is an era of great leaps forward, a time of ten thousand horses galloping, and some say: this is an era of poetry. We also believe that such an earth-shattering and inspiring era will surely produce more substantial and beautiful essays!

### 欢迎“再寄小读者”

    欢迎“再寄小读者”
    冰心同志的散文通讯“再寄小读者”今天起在副刊上不定期地连载。
    所以用“再寄”，是从三十多年前的那本“寄小读者”而来。1923年，“寄小读者”在“晨报”副刊开始连载，1926年出版。作者以充满诗情画意的散文，向小读者们描绘自然景物、旅行见闻，回忆童年的欢乐和母亲的挚爱，抒写自己的胸怀。“寄小读者”成为当时少年儿童喜爱的读物之一。
    三十多年过去了。这三十多年中，小读者和作者都经历了难以描述的剧变。如今，正当祖国跨进一个新的历史时期的时候，冰心同志又拿起笔来，向新的小读者叙述新时代的故事了。冰心同志即将远行访问西欧，我们祝她旅途健康，并且不断地为小读者多寄回一些通讯。
    提倡散文，是副刊创刊以来的志愿之一。现在，正是一个万马奔腾的大跃进的年代，有人说：这是诗的年代。我们也相信：这样移山倒海激动人心的年代，一定也会产生更多充实的、优美的散文来！
