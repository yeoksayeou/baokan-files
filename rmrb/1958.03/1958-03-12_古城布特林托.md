    The Ancient City of Butrint
    We visited Butrint, an ancient city in Albania with a three-thousand-year history, with great curiosity.
    A motorboat carried us on the calm lake surface. This is part of the Ionian Sea, and the seawater extends into the land, which people call Lake Butrint. On the opposite side of the lake is a mountain peak, and in the sunlight, two deep black marks can be clearly seen on the mountainside.
    According to legend, two evil dragons once dwelled on that mountain peak in ancient times, often causing fires, and the farmers at the foot of the mountain could not live in peace, so they sought help from the sea god. The sea god extinguished the fire with seawater and killed the evil dragons. The two black marks on the mountainside are the embodiment of the evil dragons.
    The small boat turned a corner, and from a distance, Butrint looked like a lush green umbrella floating on the water, and the castle on the small hill was also faintly visible. This scenery is like looking at Longevity Hill from Kunming Lake in Beijing, which is very beautiful and moving.
    Once ashore, ancient trees towered into the sky, and the sound of birds was noisy. It is surrounded by water on all sides, facing the Greek island of Corfu across the sea. In the sixth century BC, the Greeks came to Corfu and Butrint. In the third century AD, the Romans came, and later it was occupied by the Byzantines. Traces of these histories can still be found today.
    The ground here has been excavated and cleaned everywhere. The guide led us to the ruins of a large theater. The theater is oval in shape and entirely built of huge stones, with twenty layers of steps. It was built during the Greek invasion and later renovated by the Romans. Faint murals can be seen on the walls, as well as legal clauses carved in ancient Greek.
    Passing the theater, we saw the ruins of several stone houses with small round holes in the broken walls. It is said that this was originally the residence of nobles in Roman times, and the round holes on the walls served as both windows and for spying on the enemy. We also went to the ruins of a "Baptism Hall." The original building has long collapsed, and only bird and animal patterns and cross patterns pieced together with gravel can still be seen on the ground. According to archaeologists, these belong to the sixth-century Byzantine culture.
    After turning and twisting, we finally entered the castle on the small hill. There is a small museum here. Strangely, there are many exquisitely carved but headless stone statues in the museum. Judging from these incomplete stone statues, the patterns of the costumes are very delicate, and the postures are different. Where have their heads gone?
    It turns out that the heads of these statues began to be stolen from 1928. At that time, Sogu, with the support of Mussolini, became the King of Albania. In order to show his respect to his master, Sogu gave the head of the best queen statue among the stone statues to the Roman authorities. From then on, the Italian fascist bandits took a fancy to the cultural relics of Butrint and cut off the heads of the statues one by one and transported them to the other side of the Ionian Sea.
    Butrint, which was once a political center and cultural cradle on the Balkan Peninsula many centuries ago, is now a ruin surrounded by lakes and covered with greenery. The glory left by ancient culture still attracts tourists from Albania and abroad. (Fan Chengzhuo)

### 古城布特林托

    古城布特林托
    我们怀着极大的好奇心去参观阿尔巴尼亚的一座古城，具有三千年历史的布特林托。
    汽艇载着我们在平静的湖面行驶。这里是爱奥尼亚海的一部分，海水伸入陆地，人们称它为布特林托湖。湖对面一座山峰，在阳光下可以清楚地看见山腰拖着两条深黑色的痕迹。
    据传说，那座山峰在远古时代曾有两条妖龙盘踞着，常制造火灾，山下农民不能安居，遂求救于海神。海神用海水扑灭了火灾，战死了妖龙，山腰里那两条黑色痕迹就是妖龙的化身。
    小艇转了一个弯，远远地看到布特林托像个翠绿的伞盖浮在水面上，小岗上的城堡也隐约可见。这景色就像在北京昆明湖上看万寿山，十分美丽动人。
    上了岸，古木参天，鸟语声喧。这里四面环水，与希腊的科孚岛隔海相望。公元前六世纪，希腊人到了科孚岛和布特林托，公元三世纪时又来了罗马人，之后又被拜占庭占领。现在还能找到这些历史的遗迹。
    这里的地面都经过发掘，到处收拾得干干净净。解说员把我们领到一个大剧场的遗址。剧场呈椭圆形，全部用巨石砌成，梯级有二十层。它建于希腊入侵时期，后来罗马人又予修缮。墙上的壁画隐约可见，还有用古希腊文雕刻的法律条文。
    过了剧场，看到几幢石砌房屋的遗址，残垣断壁上有圆形小洞。据说这里原是罗马时代贵族的住家，墙上的圆洞既作为窗户，也是用来窥察敌人的。我们又到了一座“洗礼厅”的遗址，原建筑早已倒塌，仅在地面上还可以看到用碎石拼成的鸟兽图案和十字花纹。据考古学家研究，这些属于六世纪的拜占庭文化。
    转弯抹角，终于走进了小岗上的城堡。这里设有一个小小的博物馆。奇怪的是，博物馆里有许多雕刻精美但没有头部的石雕人像。从这些残缺不全的石像看，服饰花纹非常精致，姿态不一。它们的头部哪里去了呢？
    原来，从1928年开始，这些雕像的头部就开始被盗窃。当时索古在墨索里尼的扶植下，做了阿尔巴尼亚的国王，索古为了孝敬他的主子，就把石像中一个最好的王后雕像的头送给了罗马当局。从此以后，意大利法西斯强盗就看中了布特林托的文物，把雕像的头一个个砍下来，运到了爱奥尼亚海的彼岸。
    在很多世纪以前曾经是巴尔干半岛上一个政治中心和文化摇篮的布特林托，现在已经是一座湖水环抱、绿荫复盖的废墟了。古代文化留给它的光辉，还吸引着阿尔巴尼亚国内外的游客。　（范承祚）
