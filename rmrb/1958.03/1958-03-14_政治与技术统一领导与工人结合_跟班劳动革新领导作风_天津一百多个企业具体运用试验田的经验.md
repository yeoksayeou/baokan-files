    Unified Political and Technical Leadership Combined with Workers
    On-the-Job Labor to Innovate Leadership Style
    Over 100 Enterprises in Tianjin Specifically Apply the Experience of Experimental Plots
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 13th dispatch) Leading cadres from 151 large, medium, and small factories in Tianjin have universally implemented the on-the-job labor system. They have walked out of their offices and gone deep into workshops and work sections to participate in labor, concretely leading production and promoting current central tasks. At the same time, they have also stepped out of their "small families" and entered the "big family," eating, living, and laboring alongside workers.
    Among these factories are cotton textile factories, wire factories, and paper mills with relatively simple production processes and single products, as well as machine manufacturing factories with more complex production processes and products. Some large and medium-sized factories have a large number of leading cadres, so they concurrently serve as workshop administrative or Party cadres, while taking turns working alongside workers. After leading cadres go deep into the workshops, they have more timely access to information, fewer meetings, and streamlined reports. They also drive office cadres to face the workshops and better serve production. Therefore, on-the-job labor by leading cadres not only does not hinder the leadership of the factory's daily work, but, on the contrary, makes it easier to improve and promote daily work. Some small factories have fewer leading cadres, so they go deep into the groups to participate in production according to the requirements of the central tasks and help solve critical problems.
    Leading cadres in different situations have different requirements for going to the workshops. Those with technical skills go to familiar production posts to work as workers and help workers solve major production problems. Those who are not familiar with technology mostly go deep into a workshop or work section to participate in labor, establish a master-apprentice relationship with workers, learn production technology, and at the same time help the workshop do political and ideological work. Lu Zhixin, the director of the joint state-private GuangKai Paper Mill, was originally a pulping worker. After working in the No. 1 workshop, he and the workers studied the use of Northeast wood pulp instead of Guangzhou wood pulp to reduce costs. After many experiments, it has now been officially put into production, saving more than 70,000 yuan a year. Yu Wenzhong, the deputy director of the local state-owned Forging Machine Tool Factory who is not familiar with technology, went to the newly built foundry and assembly workshop to participate in labor. After he found that the "shims" were not installed on the large vehicle track, causing work stoppages, he studied solutions with the old workers.
    After the "on-the-job labor system" was established for 418 leading cadres in 151 factories throughout the city, the relationship between leaders and workers underwent profound changes. New atmospheres of leaders caring for workers and workers loving leaders appeared everywhere. Leaders and workers, and workers and workers, criticized and encouraged each other. The tremendous changes in the leadership style have inspired the workers' production enthusiasm, and good news has been continuously reported on the production front. Li Jialan, the secretary of the Party branch of the joint state-private Zhenhua Wire Factory, was originally a worker in this factory. After being detached from production, he rarely went deep into the workshop, and the workers had many opinions. This time, he went to the wrapping group to participate in labor. When he heard that the old worker Kang Jian had gotten a stomach ache on the night shift, he immediately went everywhere to find medicine, which greatly moved the workers. The workers took the initiative to report production problems to him and specifically taught him new operating methods. After the main leaders of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League of the Third Construction Site of the Third Construction Engineering Company moved their luggage into the work shed to live with the workers, many workers who used to ride their bicycles home after work rushed to move their luggage back to the construction site. The phenomenon of workers being late or leaving early due to going home was eliminated, and all attended each group meeting and airing opinions meeting. Inspired by the actual actions of the leaders going deep into the construction site, a competition was launched between the groups. Within one week of the start of construction, each group had revised the Great Leap Forward plan four times, ensuring that it would reach more than 140% of the administrative quota. At present, eight groups have exceeded this Great Leap Forward plan, and the carpentry group of Guo Yulin has reached 175% of the administrative quota.

    政治与技术统一领导与工人结合
    跟班劳动革新领导作风
    天津一百多个企业具体运用试验田的经验
    本报天津13日电  天津市一百五十一个大、中、小型工厂的领导干部，已经普遍实行跟班劳动制。他们纷纷走出办公室，深入车间、工段跟班劳动，具体领导生产和推动当前的中心工作。同时，他们也走出了“小家庭”，进入“大家庭”和工人同吃、同住、同劳动。
    在这些工厂中，有生产过程较简单、产品单一的棉织工厂、电线工厂和造纸工厂，也有生产过程和产品都较复杂的机器制造工厂。一些大、中型工厂领导干部较多，他们就一面兼任车间行政或党的职务，一面轮流跟班和工人一起劳动。领导干部深入车间以后，了解情况及时了，会议减少了，表报也精简了，并且带动科室干部面向车间，更好地为生产服务。因此，领导干部跟班劳动，不仅不会妨碍工厂日常工作的领导，而且相反，更便于改进和推动日常工作。一些小型工厂领导干部较少，他们就根据中心工作的要求，深入小组参加生产，并帮助解决关键性的问题。
    不同情况的领导干部，下车间也有不同的要求。有技术的到熟悉的生产岗位上去当工人，并帮助工人解决生产上的重大问题。不熟悉技术的人，大都深入一个车间或工段参加劳动，同工人建立师徒关系，学习生产技术，同时帮助车间作政治思想工作。公私合营广开造纸厂厂长卢志新原是打浆工人，到一车间跟班劳动后，和工人们一起研究用东北木浆代替广州木浆，降低成本。经过多次试验，现在已正式投入生产，一年可节约七万多元。不熟悉技术的地方国营锻压机床厂副厂长余文中，到新建的铸工和装配车间跟班劳动后，发现了大车轧道没有安装“垫铁”，造成窝工，就和老工人一起研究解决办法。
    全市一百五十一个工厂中的四百十八名领导干部，建立“跟班劳动制”后，领导和工人的关系发生了深刻的变化，到处出现领导关心工人，工人热爱领导的新气象。领导与工人、工人与工人互相批评、互相鼓励。领导作风的巨大变化，鼓舞了工人的生产热情，生产战线上不断传出捷报。公私合营振华电线厂支部书记李嘉兰原是这个厂的工人，脱产以后，很少深入车间，工人意见很多。这次，他到包胶组跟班劳动，听说老工人康健上夜班得了胃病，立即到各处找药，工人们很受感动。工人们主动向他反映生产上的问题，还具体地教他新的操作方法。第三建筑工程公司第三建筑工地党政工团的主要负责人，把行李搬进工棚与工人在一起住宿以后，很多下了班就骑车回家的工人争先把行李搬回工地，工人因回家造成的迟到早退的现象消灭了，每次小组会和鸣放会也都全体出席了。在领导人员深入工地的实际行动鼓舞下，各小组间展开了竞赛。在开工的一周之内，各个小组已经四次修订跃进计划，保证达到行政定额的140％以上。目前已有八个小组超过了这个跃进计划，木工郭玉林小组已达到了行政定额的175％。
