Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 24th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio revealed on the 23rd that the Indonesian government had conducted a series of discussions with officials from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia regarding the evacuation of U.S. nationals. As a result of the discussions, everyone agreed to entrust the fate and safety of the employees of the Texaco Oil Company in Central Sumatra to the Indonesian government.

Subandrio also revealed that it was also decided that U.S. ships prepared in Singapore would only be allowed to enter Indonesian territory with the permission of the Indonesian government.

Subandrio said, "Only with the deepest understanding from the U.S. government can we assume the responsibility of ensuring the safety of U.S. citizens in Central Sumatra."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 24th: Indonesia's "Merdeka" (Independence) newspaper said in an editorial today that the United States should clearly understand that the current situation in Indonesia is not simple; for the benefit of both the United States and Indonesia, the United States should immediately withdraw the U.S. warships stationed in Singapore and the U.S. Seventh Fleet conducting exercises near Indonesian territorial waters.

"Merdeka" said that if the United States does not do so, it can be considered that the activities of the U.S. Seventh Fleet are preparing for intervention, or at the very least, it can be considered a provocative action.

    印度尼西亚维护国家主权
    不准美国船只擅自入境
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约23日透露，印度尼西亚政府已经就美国侨民的撤退问题同美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的官员们进行了一系列的商谈。商谈结果，大家同意把中苏门答腊德士古石油公司的雇员的命运和安全托付给印度尼西亚政府。
    苏班德里约还透露，同时还决定，在新加坡作好准备的美国船只只有在得到印度尼西亚政府许可的情况下，才可以开进印度尼西亚领土。
    苏班德里约说：“只有在取得美国政府最深切的谅解的基础上，我们才能担负起保障中苏门答腊美侨的安全的责任。”
    据新华社雅加达24日电印度尼西亚“独立报”在今天的社论中说，美国应该认识清楚，印度尼西亚目前的局势并不是简单的；为了美国和印度尼西亚两国之间的利益，美国应该立即撤走停泊在新加坡的美国军舰和在印度尼西亚领水附近进行演习的美国第七舰队。
    “独立报”说，如果美国不这样做，就可以认为美国第七舰队的活动是在作干涉的准备，最低限度也可以认为这是挑衅性的行动。
