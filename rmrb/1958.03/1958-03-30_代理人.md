    Agent
    
    French Foreign Minister Pineau said on March 27 that the French government would make a decision on the issue of establishing rocket bases in France without parliamentary debate: if the parliament disagrees, it can overthrow the government.
    
    Pineau's words are actually equivalent to announcing that the Gaillard government is determined to live or die with the American rocket base. The Gaillard government's firm defense of the United States' right to set up rocket bases in France makes people feel that it is not the French government, but rather an agent of the US Department of Defense in France.
    
    But what exactly is the reason that makes the Gaillard government have to do this? People know that not long ago, the Gaillard government borrowed several hundred million US dollars in "emergency loans" from the United States in order to save its financial crisis. As the saying goes, "Money makes the devil turn the millstone." The underlying reason for the Gaillard government's role as an agent of the US Department of Defense is, to put it bluntly, nothing more than this.

    代理人
    法国外交部长比诺3月27日说，法国政府将不经过议会辩论就对有关在法国建立火箭基地问题作出决定：如果议会不同意，它可以推翻政府。
    比诺的这番话实际上等于是宣告，盖伊阿政府已决心与美国的火箭基地共存亡。盖伊阿政府这样坚决地维护美国在法国设置火箭基地的权利，使人觉得它好像不是法国的政府，而是美国国防部在法国的代理人似的。
    但是，究竟是什么原因使得盖伊阿政府非这样做不可呢？人们知道，不久前盖伊阿政府为了挽救它的财政危机，曾向美国借了几亿美元的“紧急贷款”。俗话说得好：“有钱能使鬼推磨”，盖伊阿政府成为美国国防部代理人角色的底蕴，说穿了，不过如此。
