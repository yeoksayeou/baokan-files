The Beijing Children's Hospital, which previously only offered four hours of regular outpatient service per day, is now open for consultations 24 hours a day, with patients seen as soon as they arrive. The wards have also broken with convention, with parents now able to call at any time to inquire about their sick children's conditions. Previously, only breastfeeding mothers were allowed to accompany their sick children, and they were required to leave the ward immediately after feeding. Now, parents of children under three years old are allowed to stay with them, and the cost of accommodation has been reduced from 45 cents to 20 cents, which parents are very satisfied with.

    小病人的福音
    北京市儿童医院过去每天只看四小时的普通门诊，现在已改为二十四小时应诊，病人随到随看。病房也打破了常规，家长可以随时打电话询问病儿的情况。过去只许哺乳母亲陪伴病儿，而且规定喂完奶立刻离开病房。现在改为三周岁以下病儿的家长都可以陪住，并且将陪住费由四角五分，降为二角，家长都很满意。
