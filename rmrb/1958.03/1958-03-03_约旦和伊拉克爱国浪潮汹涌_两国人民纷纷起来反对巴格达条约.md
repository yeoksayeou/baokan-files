Reports compiled by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency reports, people in Jordan and Iraq are launching a wave of opposition against the ruling class's policies that violate national interests.

　　Throughout Jordan, leaflets from the Jordanian "National Front" are being distributed, calling on residents to begin a general strike and oppose the Jordan-Iraq Federation, and the Baghdad Military Pact.

　　Residents and students in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, recently held large-scale demonstrations in front of the British and American embassies. Demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Down with the Baghdad Pact!" "Down with the imperialist Eisenhower Doctrine!" "Long live Arab unity!" "Long live the United Arab Republic!" The police used weapons and tear gas to deal with the demonstrators. Clashes occurred between the police and demonstrators. About one hundred demonstrators were arrested.

　　Many cities and villages in Iraq also held large-scale popular demonstrations. Demonstrators demanded the cancellation of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation, which serves imperialism, and demanded that Iraq join the United Arab Republic.

　　Under the tide of patriotic people's anger, the Jordanian authorities hurriedly armed the Bedouin nomadic tribes loyal to the royal family and dispatched them to be stationed in large settlements to suppress patriots. Bedouin punitive expeditions inflicted cruel repression on peaceful residents. King Hussein of Jordan has requested assistance from Iraq.

　　The Iraqi authorities, intimidated by the powerful people's movement, are intensifying the persecution of patriots. Hundreds of Iraqis have been arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps.

　　According to the Cairo Arab United Republic Radio (formerly Cairo Radio), Baghdad now looks like a large barracks. Iraqi authorities have concentrated armed forces in all major squares and intersections throughout Baghdad to prevent demonstrations from happening.

    约旦和伊拉克爱国浪潮汹涌
    两国人民纷纷起来反对巴格达条约
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：约旦和伊拉克各地人民正在掀起反对统治阶级执行违反民族利益的政策的浪潮。
    约旦全国到处都在散发约旦“民族阵线”的传单，号召居民开始总罢工和反对约旦—伊拉克联邦，反对巴格达军事条约。
    伊拉克首都巴格达的居民和学生最近在英国和美国大使馆前面举行了声势浩大的示威。示威的人高呼“打倒巴格达条约！”“打倒帝国主义的艾森豪威尔主义！”“阿拉伯团结万岁！”“阿拉伯联合共和国万岁！”等口号。警察使用武器和催泪弹对付示威者。警察同示威者发生了冲突。约有一百名示威者被捕。
    伊拉克的许多城市和乡村也举行了声势浩大的人民示威游行。示威者要求取消为帝国主义服务的伊拉克—约旦联邦，要求伊拉克参加阿拉伯联合共和国。
    在爱国人民的怒潮下，约旦当局急忙把忠于王室的贝都印游牧部落武装起来，并且调遣他们驻扎在大的居民点里，以镇压爱国者。贝都印人讨伐队对和平居民施以残酷镇压。约旦国王侯赛因已经向伊拉克求援。
    伊拉克当局慑于强大的人民运动，正在对爱国者加紧迫害。已有几百名伊拉克人被逮捕入狱和关进集中营。
    据开罗阿拉伯联合共和国电台（原开罗电台）说，巴格达现在看起来像一个大兵营。伊拉克当局已经把武装部队集中在巴格达全城所有主要的广场和十字路口来防止发生示威。
