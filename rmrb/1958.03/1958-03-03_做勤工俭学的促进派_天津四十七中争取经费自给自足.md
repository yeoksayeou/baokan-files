    Be Promoters of Diligence and Thrift in Work-Study Programs
    Tianjin No. 47 Middle School Strives for Financial Self-Sufficiency
    (Our Dispatch) The faculty and staff of Tianjin No. 47 Middle School, filled with revolutionary zeal, are implementing the policy of combining education with production. They have decided to vigorously carry out work-study programs, striving to achieve full self-sufficiency in public miscellaneous expenses starting from April this year. Reductions have also been made in other expenses, such as teaching experiment and internship fees, sports equipment purchase fees, and coal for the canteen. In this way, the school can save the state 15,000 yuan annually, accounting for 11.5% of the school's total expenses.
    No. 47 Middle School, located in the northern suburbs, originally had more than five mu of vacant land. Last year, the vegetables grown were sold to the school's canteen, generating considerable income. This year, the school plans to expand the planting area and mobilize students to participate in production labor in conjunction with the basic agricultural knowledge course. In terms of pig farming, the school plans to increase the number of pigs from ten last year to thirty, expanding income. In addition, the school's manure can be sold to agricultural cooperatives as fertilizer, generating more than 1,000 yuan annually. At the same time, the school will educate students to conserve water and electricity, striving to save and reduce expenses. The school will also reduce teaching experiment and internship expenses by 60.6% through methods such as making its own teaching aids. The school's sports equipment purchase fees will be completely cut this year, saving 1,400 yuan according to the original plan. Regarding saving coal in the canteen, relevant personnel have also devised many methods, which can save 48 to 63 tons of coal per year.
    In the process of discussing and formulating the Great Leap Forward plan, the enthusiasm of the faculty and staff was very high. Everyone expressed that they must be a promoter and never be a drag. Many teachers proposed that, in order to strive for full financial self-sufficiency as soon as possible, they must adhere to and do a good job in work-study programs.

    做勤工俭学的促进派
    天津四十七中争取经费自给自足
    本报讯　天津市第四十七中学的教职员工鼓足革命干劲，贯彻执行教育与生产相结合的方针，决定大力开展勤工俭学的活动，争取从今年四月份起，公杂费做到全部自给自足，其他教学实验实习费、体育购置费、伙食用煤等费用也都做了削减。这样，全年可为国家节约一万五千元，占该校全部经费之11.5％。
    位于北郊的四十七中，原有五亩多空地，去年种的蔬菜卖给学校伙食团，收入不少，今年准备扩大种植面积，结合农业基础知识课程，发动学生参加生产劳动。在养猪方面，准备将去年养的十头猪增加到三十头，扩大收入。此外，学校的粪便可做为农肥卖给农业社，每年也可收入一千多元。同时还将对学生进行节约水电的教育，力求节约，减少开支。该校还要通过自制教具等办法来减少教学实验实习经费60.6％；该校的体育用品购置费今年将全部削减，按原计划节约一千四百元。在节约食堂用煤方面，有关人员也想了很多办法，一年可以节煤四十八到六十三吨。
    在讨论制订跃进规划的过程中，教职员工们的热情非常高涨，大家纷纷表示：要做一个促进派，决不做促退派。很多教师提出，为了争取早日做到全部经费自给自足，一定要坚持搞好勤工俭学。
