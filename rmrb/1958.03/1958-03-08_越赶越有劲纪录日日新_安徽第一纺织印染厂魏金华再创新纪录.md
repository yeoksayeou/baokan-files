Wei Jinhua of Anhui No. 1 Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory Sets New Record Again
(Our newspaper's dispatch) On February 15th, another encouraging news came from the preparation workshop of Anhui No. 1 Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory: Wei Jinhua, a winder in the cone winding section, exceeded the output of female worker Wu Shuying with a daily production of 128 kilograms of cotton yarn, setting a new national record again.

    越赶越有劲纪录日日新
    安徽第一纺织印染厂魏金华再创新纪录
    本报讯　2月15日从安徽第一纺织印染厂的准备车间里又传出了一个振奋人心的消息：筒子工段档车工魏金华，以日产一百二十八公斤棉纱超过了本厂女工吴淑英，再创全国新纪录。
    这次新纪录是在筒子工段开展劳动竞赛的热潮中涌现出来的。当乙班的魏金华以日产一百二十一点五公斤跑在前面的时候，丙班的吴淑英立即追到日产一百二十一点七五公斤。这时魏金华检查了自己的工作方法，向吴淑英挑战，并以日产一百二十四公斤的成绩再度领先。吴淑英一面应战，一面和另外七位档车工在一起开会交流了经验。散会后，她们立即跑进车间参观学习了魏金华的工作方法，提出三个星期赶上魏金华的保证。经过三天的努力，吴淑英就以日产一百二十六点三七五公斤的出色成绩，又赶过了魏金华，打破了全国一百二十五公斤的纪录。这时甲班的邵幼妹也从日产一百一十九公斤，提高到一百二十六点二五公斤，紧紧跟随着吴淑英。魏金华再度总结了自己的工作方法，吸取了别人的经验，提早一个钟头做好准备工作，到15日六时下班，再度以日产一百二十八公斤的成绩突破了吴淑英创造的全国新纪录。
