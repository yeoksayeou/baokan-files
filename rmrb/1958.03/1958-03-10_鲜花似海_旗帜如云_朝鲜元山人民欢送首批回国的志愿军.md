Xinhua News Agency, Wonsan, 9th – Over 60,000 people in Wonsan City held a grand send-off rally today to bid farewell to the first group of Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) withdrawing from Korea.

This morning, the square in front of Wonsan City Station, where the send-off rally was held, was a sea of flowers and a cloud of banners. The masses, dressed in festive attire, held high portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong. They also held huge banners with slogans that read: "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Korean and Chinese People Forged in Blood!" and "We Will Never Forget the Meritorious Deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers!" When the head of the delegation of the first group of CPV withdrawing from Korea, Major General Wang Mingkun, and 93 other representatives, accompanied by Wen Tae-he and Kim Jong-heng, Chairman of the Kangwon Province Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, ascended the rostrum, the masses in the square erupted in thunderous cheers. Over a hundred white-haired elderly men and women rushed onto the rostrum together to present flowers to the CPV representatives.

After the rally officially began, Wen Tae-he delivered a farewell speech, saying that the Chinese People's Volunteers came to defend the peace of Korea and to assist the Korean people's just war of national liberation, and are now withdrawing to their motherland to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The CPV's initiative to withdraw from Korea is a major step in promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea. Now, it is a matter of the US invading forces withdrawing from South Korea.

Wen Tae-he said that in the battle to defeat the US invaders, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, displaying unparalleled bravery and collective heroism. In particular, the feats established by heroes like Huang Jiguang of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Battle of Shangganling and the Battle of Kumsong, which left the deepest impression on the people of Kangwon Province, will never be forgotten by our future generations. He also spoke about the CPV's assistance to the Korean people in post-war reconstruction. Wen Tae-he said that the Korean people respect and love the CPV like their own brothers. Park Jae-geun, a farmer in Kangwon Province, sacrificed his life to protect wounded CPV soldiers during an enemy air raid. He said that the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people is priceless. The Korean people will always advance together with the Chinese people.

Next, Major General Wang Mingkun, head of the CPV delegation, delivered a reply. He first expressed gratitude on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the first group of withdrawing CPV to the people of Kangwon Province, who had given the CPV meticulous care and treated them like family over the past seven years. He said that whether in wartime or post-war, the Korean people have done their best to support us, and we will never forget the deeds of martyr Park Jae-geun. The high internationalist spirit of the people of Kangwon Province has not only given us tremendous perseverance but will also always be a model for us to learn from. Wang Mingkun said that we will always cherish the extraordinary friendship between the people of China and Korea as we cherish the apple of our eye. If the United States and its followers dare to launch another war of aggression, as long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their own sons and daughters across the Yalu River again to inflict a more devastating blow to the invaders together with the Korean People's Army. He concluded by saying that we firmly believe that the peaceful reunification of Korea will surely be realized.

Also present today to bid farewell to the CPV were Grandma Ham Jae-bok, who was called "CPV Mother" by the CPV soldiers, Lee Ok-seon, the wife of martyr Park Jae-geun, and their eight-year-old daughter Park Bok-soon, the famous model of support for the front, Gu Fuli, and the sixteen-year-old Korean child Lee Cheong-hwan, who was rescued from an ice cave by CPV soldier Huang Zhifu, among others. They reluctantly bid farewell to the departing CPV representatives. Grandma Ham Jae-bok gave her family heirloom silver ring to the CPV representative.

At the end of the rally, there was a warm scene of farewell between the CPV and the Korean people in the square. The CPV representatives were surrounded by students from Wonsan City, and they signed autographs for each other as keepsakes. The CPV representatives and the people of Wonsan City joined hands to dance the Korean collective dance - the "Um Hey Ya" dance. Art groups from the Kangwon Province National Art Theater and factories, schools, and other units also performed wonderful programs for the CPV representatives.

The Kangwon Province Farewell Committee held a farewell banquet for the CPV representatives tonight.

    鲜花似海　旗帜如云
    朝鲜元山人民欢送首批回国的志愿军
    据新华社元山9日电　元山市六万多群众今天举行盛大的欢送大会，欢送中国人民志愿军第一批撤出朝鲜的部队。
    今天上午，在举行欢送大会的元山市车站前的广场上，鲜花似海，旗帜如云。穿着节日服装的群众，高举着金日成首相和毛泽东主席的画像，他们还举着巨大的横幅标语，上面写着：“以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！”“我们不忘记中国人民志愿军的功迹”。当中国人民志愿军第一批撤出朝鲜的部队代表团团长王明坤少将等九十三名代表在文泰和和朝鲜劳动党江原道委员会委员长金宗恒等陪同下登上主席台时，广场上的群众发出了春雷般的欢呼。一百多名白发苍苍的老大爷和老大娘一起拥上主席台，把鲜花献给了志愿军代表。
    大会正式开始后，文泰和致欢送词说，中国人民志愿军是为保卫朝鲜的和平、援助朝鲜人民正义的祖国解放战争而来的，现在又为和平解决朝鲜问题而撤回祖国。中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜；是促进朝鲜和平统一的重大措施。现在就是美国侵略军从南朝鲜撤出的问题了。
    文泰和说，在击败美国侵略者的战斗中，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，发挥了无比的勇敢精神和集体英雄主义。尤其是在江原道人民心目中印象最深的上甘岭战斗和金城反击战中，黄继光英雄等中国人民志愿军所建立的功勋，是我们子孙万代所永远不能忘记的。他还谈到战后时期志愿军帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设的情形。文泰和说，朝鲜人民像对亲兄弟一样地尊敬和热爱志愿军。江原道内的农民朴在根在敌机轰炸时为保卫志愿军伤员而牺牲了自己的生命。他说，朝中两国人民的友谊是无价之宝。朝鲜人民永远同中国人民一起前进。
    接着，志愿军代表团团长王明坤少将致答词。他首先代表第一批撤出的志愿军全体官兵向七年来给予志愿军无微不至的关怀、同志愿军亲如骨肉的江原道人民表示感谢。他说，无论在战时或战后，朝鲜人民都尽全力支援我们，朴在根烈士的事迹我们永远不会忘记。江原道人民这种高度的国际主义精神不仅给予我们巨大的毅力，而且永远是我们学习的榜样。王明坤说，我们将永远像爱护眼珠一样来爱护朝中两国人民之间的不平常的友谊。如果美国和它的追随者胆敢再一次发动侵略战争，只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将会毫不迟疑地派出自己的子弟兵，再一次跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民军一起给侵略者以更惨重的打击。他最后说，我们深信朝鲜的和平统一是一定能够实现的。
    今天来欢送志愿军的还有被志愿军称为“志愿军妈妈”的咸在福老大娘、朴在根烈士的妻子李玉善和八岁的女儿朴福顺，著名的支前模范具富力，被志愿军战士黄治富从冰窟中救出的十六岁的朝鲜儿童李清焕等。他们同即将分别的志愿军代表们留恋地话别。咸在福老妈妈把她的家传的银戒子送给了志愿军代表。
    大会结束时广场上出现了志愿军和朝鲜人民告别的热烈场面。志愿军代表们为元山市的学生层层包围，他们互相签名留念。志愿军代表们同元山市人民一同手拉手跳着朝鲜集体舞蹈——“嗡嘿呀”舞。江原道道立艺术剧场和工厂、学校等单位的艺术小组还为志愿军代表们演出了精彩的节目。
    江原道欢送委员会今天晚上为志愿军代表举行欢送宴会。
