A new way for Shanghai literary and art circles to go deep into life and among the masses: Literary and art workers and workers and peasants become "relatives."

In the comprehensive implementation of the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, Shanghai literary and art circles have created a good way to go deep into life and among the masses: literary and art troupes become "relatives" with grassroots units such as factories and agricultural cooperatives. When a literary and art troupe becomes "relatives" with a factory or agricultural cooperative, it maintains regular contact with that unit, frequently performing at that unit or sending people to reside in those units for creation, guiding the amateur literary and art activities of those units, working with workers and peasants, and making close friends among workers and peasants. With such "relatives," each troupe establishes a firm foundation in industrial and agricultural units and among workers and peasants, establishing an inseparable relationship like water and milk.

The "becoming relatives" between literary and art troupes and industrial and agricultural units was proposed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture after summarizing the experiences of the Shanghai People's Huaiju Opera Troupe and other units in going deep into life and among the masses. In the past few years, the Huaiju Opera Troupe has established "friend" relationships with 80 factories in Shanghai and many agricultural cooperatives in northern Jiangsu, with more than half of its performances each year taking place in factories and rural areas, while also providing guidance to amateur Huaiju Opera troupes in industry and agriculture. Now, when the Huaiju Opera Troupe performs in factories, many workers say, "Our friends have come," and some even hang large red banners: "Welcome our friends – the Shanghai People's Huaiju Opera Troupe." The year before last, when the Huaiju Opera Troupe performed at the Xuri Agricultural Cooperative in Yancheng County, northern Jiangsu, the area happened to be hit by a disaster. The troupe used its rest time to give free performances and bought water buffaloes and wooden boats to give to the Xuri Cooperative. Since then, the troupe and the Xuri Cooperative have established a close relationship and communicate frequently. Last year, when the Huaiju Opera Troupe went to northern Jiangsu to perform again, farmers from the Xuri Cooperative traveled a long way to find them, insisting on inviting the actors to visit the cooperative to see the harvest scene. Now, everyone in the troupe has worker and peasant friends. The famous Huaiju Opera actress Xiao Wenyan alone has more than a dozen good friends, and often receives letters from them. When the troupe performs a new play, they also invite worker and peasant audiences to hold discussion meetings, soliciting opinions before making revisions. "Harvesting Wheat" is a traditional Huaiju Opera repertoire. The Huaiju Opera Troupe had revised it themselves, and everyone thought it was very good, but after watching the performance of a peasant amateur troupe, they discovered that the peasants had many advantages in singing and plot, mainly that they could better reflect the lives of the working people. The Huaiju Opera Troupe then seriously learned from the peasants and improved the quality of "Harvesting Wheat." Because of the close relationship established with workers and peasants, the Huaiju Opera Troupe has maintained the simple ideological feelings and style of the working people over the years, and has also made significant improvements in art. In order to promote these excellent traditions and further comprehensively implement the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Huaiju Opera Troupe has now become "relatives" with these units, turning into a close and seamless connection between units, combining performance, labor, guidance, and making friends. They plan to make fourteen "relatives" in five years, and five this year. Each staff member has made a plan to make worker and peasant friends. In the past two months, many other drama, ballad, and music troupes in Shanghai have held large-scale巡回performances in factories, rural areas, and troops, and have begun to get closer to workers, peasants, and soldiers. Especially during the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, many literary and art troupes went deep into factories, creating, performing, and tutoring on the spot, and established feelings with many workers. This initial connection will now be used in the form of "relatives" to fix the relationship between units, develop and improve it. The Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe went to the No. 17 State Cotton Factory not long ago to perform, and was not only warmly welcomed by the workers, but labor model Huang Baomei also sang "Pan Fu" on stage with the famous actress Xu Yulan. Now that the Yue Opera Troupe and the No. 17 State Cotton Factory have become "relatives," when the Yue Opera Troupe held a leap forward oath-taking meeting, Huang Baomei and more than a dozen employees of the amateur Yue Opera group came to pay their respects, hoping to visit each other often, and welcome the Yue Opera Troupe to go to the factory to participate in labor training. The Shanghai People's Art Theater is also preparing to make several "relatives."

"Becoming relatives" is a creation because it consciously concentrates, fixes, and makes more frequent many of the works and ideas that were previously carried out in a scattered way, and some were in the embryonic stage, such as performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers, labor training, tutoring, and making worker and peasant friends. It will undoubtedly play a huge role in promoting the great leap forward of literary and art work. It enables literary and art workers to find a way to participate in labor training that is suitable for their own characteristics. After the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the Shanghai literary and art circles are very eager to transform themselves and have applied to be sent down to labor for training. However, there are practical difficulties. For example, if a pianist participates in physical labor for a long time, away from artistic practice, his fingers will not be as sensitive as before. The troupe was originally a complete combination of male, female, clown, and painted face. If a few main actors are sent down, the entire troupe may not be able to perform. Now, in addition to those who are suitable for long-term decentralization being decentralized in batches, generally, they can participate in labor training in the "relatives'" home, while performing and tutoring, combining labor and artistic practice. It also emphasizes making close friends, learning from friends, asking for advice, and combining physical labor with the transformation of thoughts and feelings. The quality and effect of巡回performances for workers, peasants, and soldiers will definitely be improved compared to the present, because there are "points" in the "surface," and there are close friends. Art will also become more and more vital under the nurturing of workers and peasants. Especially for the development of mass amateur literary and art activities, after all literary and art troupes in Shanghai have generally made "relatives," and literary and art workers have generally made worker and peasant friends, and then brought a circle around, the tutoring work of amateur literary and art activities in all factories, schools, shops, agricultural cooperatives, and even neighborhood residents in the city can basically be fully driven. As a result of the promotion of "becoming relatives" in the city, the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers will inevitably be further comprehensively implemented, and the literary and art cause will be greatly prospered. Not only will the existing literary and art workers reach the requirements of being "both red and expert" with the help of "relatives," but also a large number of new literary and art fighters of the working class will be cultivated in "relatives."

### 上海文艺界深入生活深入群众的新方式  文艺工作者和工人农民攀“亲家”

    上海文艺界深入生活深入群众的新方式
    文艺工作者和工人农民攀“亲家”
    本报特约新华社专稿　上海文艺界在全面贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方针中，创造了一种深入生活、深入群众的好方式：文艺团体和工厂、农业社等基层单位攀“亲家”。文艺团体和工厂、农业社攀上了“亲家”，就经常地和这个单位联系，经常到这个单位去演出或者派人驻在这些单位进行创作，辅导这些单位的业余文艺活动，和工人农民一起劳动，在工人农民中结交知心朋友。每个团体有了这样的“亲家”，就在工农业单位中、工农群众中扎下牢固的根子，和工人农民建立起水乳交融般不可分离的关系。
    文艺团体和工农业单位攀“亲家”，是上海市文化局总结了上海市人民淮剧团以及其他单位深入生活、深入群众的经验以后提出的。淮剧团在过去几年中，跟上海的八十个工厂和苏北的许多农业社建立了“朋友”关系，每年都有一半以上场次在工厂、农村中演出，同时对工农业余淮剧团体作辅导。现在淮剧团下厂演出时，许多工人说：“我们的朋友来了”，有的还挂起大红的标语：“欢迎我们的朋友——上海市人民淮剧团”。前年淮剧团到苏北盐城县旭日农业社演出，正巧当地遇到灾荒，剧团就利用休息时间作义务演出，买了水牛、木船送给旭日社。从此剧团和旭日社建立了亲密的关系，经常通信。去年淮剧团又去苏北演出，旭日社的农民老远跑去找他们，一定要请演员们到社里去看看丰收景象。现在团里每个人都有工农朋友，著名淮剧演员筱文艳一人就有十多个好朋友，经常收到他们的来信。剧团演了新戏，也请工农观众来开座谈会，征求意见后再修改。“割大麦”是淮剧的传统剧目，淮剧团自己曾经加以整理，大家都认为很好，但是看了农民业余剧团的演出，发现农民在唱腔和情节上有许多优点，主要是更能体现劳动人民的生活，淮剧团就认真地向农民学习，提高了“割大麦”的质量。由于和工农建立了亲密的关系，淮剧团几年来一直保持着劳动人民纯朴的思想感情和作风，艺术上也有显著提高，为了发扬这些优良的传统，进一步全面贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方针，淮剧团现在已经和这些单位成为“亲家”，变成了单位与单位之间的亲密无间的联系，作到演出、劳动、辅导、交朋友四者相结合。他们计划在五年内攀十四个“亲家”，今年先攀五个。每个工作人员都订出交工农朋友的计划。上海其他的许多戏剧、曲艺、音乐团体，近两个月来在工厂、农村、部队中举行了大规模的巡回演出，开始和工农兵接近起来。特别是反浪费反保守运动中，许多文艺团体深入工厂，现场创作，现场演出，现场辅导，和许多工人建立了感情。这种初步建立的联系，现在也将用“亲家”的形式把单位与单位之间的关系固定下来，使其发展和提高。上海越剧院不久前到国棉十七厂去演出，不但受到工人热烈的欢迎，劳动模范黄宝妹还和著名演员徐玉兰一起登台合唱“盘夫”。现在越剧院和国棉十七厂攀了“亲家”，越剧院开跃进誓师大会时，黄宝妹等十多位业余越剧组的职工前来登门道贺，希望彼此常来常往，欢迎越剧院人员到厂里去参加劳动锻炼。上海人民艺术剧院也准备攀好几个“亲家”。
    攀“亲家”是一个创造，因为它把过去是分散进行的、有的是处在萌芽状态的许多工作和思想，如为工农兵演出、劳动锻炼、辅导、交工农朋友等等有意识地更集中更固定，更经常地来进行。它对文艺工作的大跃进，无疑会起巨大的促进作用。它使文艺工作者找到了适合本身特点的参加劳动锻炼的方式。上海文艺界经过反右派斗争和整风运动，要求改造的心情十分迫切，纷纷申请下放到劳动中去锻炼。但是存在着实际困难。如弹钢琴的长期参加体力劳动，脱离艺术实践，手指就会没有原来那么灵敏，剧团内原来是生、旦、丑、净搭配整齐，如果下放了几个主要演员，有可能使全团无法演出。现在除了适合长期下放的人分批长期下放以外，一般都可以在“亲家”家中参加劳动锻炼，同时进行演出和辅导，使劳动和艺术实践结合起来。而且强调了交知心朋友，向朋友学习、请教，体力劳动和思想感情的改造也结合起来。为工农兵巡回演出的质量和效果，由于“面”中有“点”，有知心朋友，一定会比现在提高，艺术也会在工农的哺育之下，越来越富有生命力。特别是对群众业余文艺活动的开展，在上海各个文艺团体普遍攀了“亲家”、文艺工作者普遍交了工农朋友后，四周再带一圈，全市所有工厂、学校、商店、农业社以至里弄居民的业余文艺活动的辅导工作，基本上可以全部带动起来。攀“亲家”在全市推广的结果，文艺为工农兵服务的方针势必将进一步全面贯彻，文艺事业将大大繁荣，不但现有的文艺工作者在“亲家”的帮助下达到“又红又专”的要求，还将在“亲家”中培养出大批工人阶级的新的文艺战士。
