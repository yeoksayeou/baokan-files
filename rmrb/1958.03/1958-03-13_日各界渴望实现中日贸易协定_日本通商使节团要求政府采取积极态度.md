Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th: After returning from China following the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the Japanese trade mission reported to representatives of various circles in Japan on March 12th regarding the circumstances of the signing of the trade agreement.

	Kiyoshi Katsumada, a member of the trade mission, requested at the report meeting that the Japanese side make efforts to implement the trade agreement.

	Another member of the mission, Gengziro Ueki of the Liberal Democratic Party, said in his report that he hoped the Liberal Democratic Party would reach a consensus on the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement as soon as possible, so that the agreement could be implemented smoothly as soon as possible.

	Representatives from Japanese industrial, trade, labor union, press, and mass organizations attended the report meeting. In their speeches, they all expressed their willingness to work hard for the complete realization of the new Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

	Today, the "Tokyo Shimbun" published an article by Kiyoshi Katsumada in a prominent position on the front page. Katsumada pointed out in the article that the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement marked a new stage in the development of Sino-Japanese trade. He said that although the trade agreement negotiations encountered many difficulties, the agreement was finally signed because the Chinese side always maintained a friendly attitude towards Japan.

	Katsumada believes that the most important issue at present is to strive for the Japanese government's recognition of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and to realize the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices as soon as possible.

	According to today's "Akahata" report, Mission member Kanichi Kawakami told its reporters at Haneda Airport that he hoped the Japanese people would redouble their efforts to promote the full implementation of the trade agreement and the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices.

	According to today's newspapers, the head of the Japanese trade mission, Masanosuke Ikeda, and Kiyoshi Katsumada held a symposium with representatives of the Japanese trade community. At the symposium, Yu Shimura, Deputy General Manager of the famous trading company Toyo Cotton Company, said that he felt as if "a long-awaited sun rose from the East" after the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.
