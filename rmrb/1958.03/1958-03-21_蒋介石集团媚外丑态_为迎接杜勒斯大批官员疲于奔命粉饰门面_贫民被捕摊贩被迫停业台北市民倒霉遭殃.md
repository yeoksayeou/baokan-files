Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th. Taiwan newspapers recently reported the ugly, oppressive, and pro-foreign behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek clique when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles visited Taiwan. The news said that before Dulles arrived in Taiwan on the 14th, Chiang Kai-shek clique officials had been scrambling for days to "welcome Secretary Dulles" and rush to do various cosmetic jobs. The wives and concubines of officials preparing to "receive foreign guests" also hurriedly put on heavy makeup. However, many Taipei citizens suffered because of Dulles's arrival.

The news said that Taipei police officers were ordered to "work day and night" before Dulles's arrival, hoping to temporarily improve the security of this city, which has many robberies, thefts, and traffic accidents every day. The Kuomintang authorities also ordered the mass arrest of beggars and ragged people in order to show Dulles that "Taiwan under U.S. aid has no beggars or poor people." Hundreds of newspaper, cigarette, and other stall owners on four busy roads in Taipei were also forced to stop business the day before Dulles arrived. A Taipei newspaper published an editorial entitled "Welcoming Foreign Guests and Banning Stall Owners," saying that the stall owners rely on small businesses and maintain their poor lives with meager profits, but when Dulles comes, they suffer even more, stopping work and going hungry. The newspaper worried that the Taiwanese people would therefore increase their anti-American sentiment. (Attached picture)

    蒋介石集团媚外丑态
    为迎接杜勒斯大批官员疲于奔命粉饰门面
    贫民被捕摊贩被迫停业台北市民倒霉遭殃
    新华社广州20日电　台湾报纸最近报道了美国国务卿杜勒斯到台湾时，蒋介石集团一副残民媚外的丑态。消息说，在杜勒斯14日到台湾以前，蒋介石集团的官员们好几天为了“迎接杜卿”而疲于奔命，赶着做各种粉饰门面的工作。准备“接待外宾”的官太太和姨太太们也赶紧浓妆艳抹。而许多台北市民却因杜勒斯的到来倒霉遭殃。
    消息说，台北市的警察人员在杜勒斯抵达前奉命“日以继夜工作”，想使这个每天都发生许多抢劫、偷盗、车祸等案件的城市的治安暂时好一点。国民党当局还命令大举逮捕乞丐和衣衫破烂的人，以便向杜勒斯表示“美援下的台湾没有乞丐和贫民”。在台北市四条热闹马路上的数百户书报、香烟等摊贩，也在杜勒斯到来的前一天被迫停止营业。一家台北报纸发表了“欢迎外宾与取缔摊贩”的社论说，摊贩们都靠小本营生，借蝇头微利维持每天可怜的苦日子，可是杜勒斯一来，他们更遭殃倒霉，停业挨饿。这家报纸担心台湾人民将因此更增加了反美情绪。（附图片）
