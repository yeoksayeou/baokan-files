Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, London Dispatch: London newspapers reported today that the British government's test launch of a large military rocket failed on March 6th.

According to reports, the rocket, forty feet long, was launched from the Aberporth region in South Wales—the British rocket research center. After the launch, it was discovered that the rocket did not fly in the intended direction: instead of flying towards the ocean, it flew inland. Therefore, it had to be destroyed by radio control. It was revealed that this rocket was the largest military rocket ever launched by the Aberporth test center.

British official spokesmen have confirmed the news of the failed test rocket.

    英国试验军用火箭失败
    新华社18日讯　伦敦消息：据伦敦报纸今天报道，英国政府在3月6日试验发射一枚大型军用火箭失败。
    据报道，这支火箭长四十英尺，是从威尔士南部的阿伯波斯地区——英国火箭研究中心——发射出去的。在发射以后发现这支火箭没有按照预定的方向飞行：它不是飞向海洋而是向着内陆飞行，因此，不得不通过无线电操纵炸毁这支火箭。据透露，这支火箭是阿伯波斯试验中心迄今所发射过的最大的一支军用火箭。
    英国官方发言人已经证实这一试验火箭失败的消息。
