Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 6th: Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Inajiro Asanuma, Diet Policy Committee Chairman Mitsu Kono, International Bureau Director Soji Okada, and others submitted recommendations to the government on the newly signed Sino-Japanese trade agreement on the afternoon of the 6th, requesting the government to "quickly approve this agreement and make every effort to implement it." The Liberal Democratic Party also submitted written recommendations to the government on the Sino-Japanese trade agreement on the same day. The recommendations stated: "Promoting Sino-Japanese trade is the demand of the people, and we also hope to expand Sino-Japanese trade."

Hakamada Satomi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on the 6th, pointing out the importance of establishing permanent private business representative offices in each other's capitals, and believes that this is a new achievement of the increasingly high tide of the movement for peace and friendship between the people of China and Japan.

In his statement, Hakamada strongly condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. After learning that the Sino-Japanese trade agreement had been signed, Kishida Nobusuke even said at the Senate Budget Committee on the 5th: "Since there is a clause in the memorandum about hanging the national flag, it is difficult for the government to recognize the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement." He believes that Kishida Nobusuke's remarks not only hinder the smooth implementation of the agreement but also greatly hinder the promotion of friendly relations between China and Japan and the restoration of diplomatic relations.

The Japanese business and industrial circles, especially the steel industry, warmly welcomed the signing of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Kurata Chinue, chairman of Hitachi, said, "This is exactly the time for the industrial world to face China." He said that the industrial world is organizing a committee to study the issue of expanding trade with China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 6th: Major Japanese newspapers published editorials, commentaries, and articles on the 6th, welcoming the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The "Asahi Shimbun" editorial emphasized that the signing of the trade agreement, especially the realization of the mutual establishment of private business representative offices, has significant meaning and role in the concrete implementation of trade business.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" editorial pointed out that the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement "marks a new starting point for Sino-Japanese trade."

The "Mainichi Shimbun" editorial pointed out that the signing of the trade agreement will help the further development of trade between China and Japan on a smooth basis.

Leaders of Japanese groups also unanimously welcomed the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. They unanimously believe that in the future, the power of the people must be united to urge the Japanese government to guarantee the full realization of the trade agreement.

Akira Kazami, chairman of the Japan National Conference for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, believes that the signing of the agreement has taken a step forward in promoting the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Yoshikyuki Kitagawa, International Director of "Sohyo," pointed out that demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations is an important slogan of "Sohyo" in launching the spring struggle. Therefore, "Sohyo" will combine the demand for the full realization of the trade agreement and the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations in the future and strive to realize it.

    日本各界欢迎中日贸易新协定
    社会党要求政府迅速批准并贯彻执行
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、国会对策委员会委员长河野密、国际局局长冈田宗司等在6日下午就新签订的日中贸易协定向政府提出建议，要求政府“迅速批准这个协定，并且竭尽全力加以贯彻执行”。自由民主党也在同一天就日中贸易协定向政府提出了书面建议。建议说：“增进日中贸易是国民的要求，我们也希望扩大日中贸易。”
    日本共产党中央常任干部会委员袴田里见6日发表谈话，指出在两国首都互相设置常驻的民间商务代表机构的重要意义，并且认为这是日中两国人民日益高涨的争取和平与友好运动所获得的新成就。
    袴田在谈话中强烈指责岸信介政府对日中贸易协定所采取的态度。岸信介在得悉日中贸易协定已经签订的消息后，竟然在五日参议院预算委员会上说：“既然在备忘录中有悬挂国旗这一条，政府是很难承认第四次日中贸易协定”。他认为岸信介说的这番话不但对顺利执行协定有妨害，而且对于促进日中两国的友好关系与恢复邦交也有很大妨碍。
    日本贸易界和工业界，特别是钢铁工业界，都对日中贸易协定的签订表示热烈欢迎。日立制作所董事长仓田主税说，“这正是工业界面向中国的时候”。他说，工业界正要组织一个委员会来研究扩展同中国的贸易的问题。
    据新华社6日讯　东京消息日本各大报6日都发表社论、评论和文章，欢迎第四次日中贸易协定的签订。
    “朝日新闻”的社论强调指出，贸易协定的签订，尤其是互设民间商务代表机构的实现、在具体执行贸易业务上具有重大的意义和作用。
    “读卖新闻”的社论指出第四次日中贸易协定的签订“标志着日中贸易的新的起点”。
    “每日新闻”社论指出，贸易协定的签订将有助于日中两国的贸易在顺利的基础上进一步发展。
    日本各团体领导人也一致欢迎第四次日中贸易协定的签订，他们一致认为今后要团结人民的力量，促使日本政府保证全面实现贸易协定。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章认为，协定的签订把恢复日中邦交向前推进了一步。
    “总评”国际部长北川义行指出，要求恢复邦交是“总评”在展开春季斗争中的一项重要口号，因此，“总评”今后将把完全实现贸易协定和恢复日中邦交的要求并在一起，努力促其实现。
