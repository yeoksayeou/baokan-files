"Young Master"

    In the anti-waste campaign, the former Ministry of Higher Education revealed that a segment of university graduates harbored bourgeois enjoyment thinking in the national university graduate assignment process, spending money lavishly and arbitrarily, causing serious waste. Wang Tieshi and twelve other graduates from Dalian Normal Junior College were assigned to work in Xi'an. Their train tickets should have been purchased as through tickets from Dalian to Xi'an, but in order to travel in Shenyang and Beijing, they split the journey into three segments, resulting in a waste of 260 yuan in travel expenses. Zhang Shanglun, a graduate of Nanjing Forestry College, was supposed to report to the Hebei Provincial Personnel Bureau in Baoding City, and should have taken a train from Nanjing to Dezhou, Shandong, to transfer to Baoding. However, Zhang Shanglun arbitrarily changed his route midway for sightseeing. (Yang Chunmao)

    “大少爷”
    原高等教育部在反浪费中，揭发出在全国高等学校毕业生派遣工作中，一部分大学毕业生滋长着一种资产阶级享受思想，大手大脚随意花钱，造成严重的浪费。大连师范专科学校毕业生王铁石等十三人分配去西安工作，他们的火车票应由大连买通票到西安，但他们为了在沈阳、北京游玩，分了三段办理，结果浪费旅费二百六十元。南京林学院毕业生张尚伦报到地点是保定市河北省人事局，应从南京乘火车至山东德州转车保定。但张尚伦随便中途改道游玩。（杨春茂）
