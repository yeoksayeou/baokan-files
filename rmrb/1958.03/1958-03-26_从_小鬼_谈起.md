    Starting with "Little Devils"
    Wen Yi
    In our revolutionary ranks, the term "little devil" used to be very popular, embodying the close relationship between cadres and service personnel. However, in recent years, this term has gradually faded away. Fewer and fewer cadres call younger service personnel "little devils," and many service personnel are also unwilling to be called "little devils." The problem is not so much whether we can hear this term, but that the relationship between service personnel and cadres is not as close as before. It is especially noteworthy that many service personnel have low political awareness and lack enthusiasm for work. Although most service personnel are working actively and making certain contributions to socialist construction, the problems are still quite serious, judging from the bad elements with poor character who have been uncovered in various organs during this rectification movement. Some of them sow discord or steal public and private property within the organs; others do not abide by the rules of public life, and even harass and insult women. Their behavior disrupts the order of the organs' work and tarnishes the honor of the staff of state organs. Such bad elements are certainly only a minority among the service personnel, but this small number of black sheep has already caused serious losses to state organs, which cannot but attract everyone's attention.
    Why do these phenomena occur among service personnel? This requires an analysis of the situation of service personnel. In the past, the service personnel who were called "little devils," although young and with a low level of education, generally had relatively high political awareness. They regarded service work as part of the entire revolutionary work, understanding that doing this part of the work well would add a strength to the revolution. Therefore, they generally loved their work and were proud to be "little Eighth Route Armymen" and "little red devils." The situation of the service personnel newly recruited after liberation is not entirely the same. Many of them joined the work with various different motives. Some simply wanted to "earn a salary," some wanted to become cadres, and some wanted to come to the city to live a "good life." Many people regard service work as "inferior" work, "serving people." They are now doing this kind of work out of necessity, and as long as there is an opportunity, they ask to be transferred to other jobs. In the life of the organs, the situation is also different from the past. For example, the work is tense, the residences are scattered, and there is a lack of opportunities for common activities, which is one aspect. However, more importantly, in some cadres, there is indeed a part of people who look down on the work of service personnel. These cadres act as if they are officials, not treating service personnel with an equal attitude. This also aroused the resentment of service personnel and fostered their incorrect thinking and sense of inferiority. In this way, the relationship between cadres and service personnel will certainly not be very close, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of service personnel will also be affected to a certain extent.
    More importantly, many organs have relaxed or even abandoned the management and education of service personnel. They do not pay attention to examining political quality when recruiting service personnel, and they have relaxed the political and ideological education of service personnel on weekdays. Many service personnel have been working for several years, but their ideological awareness has not only not improved, but also, under the influence of bourgeois ideology, bad ideas and bad habits have developed. Furthermore, a small number of people with bad ideological qualities have also taken the opportunity to infiltrate the ranks of the organs' service personnel, and have done many bad things in the organs and in society over the years. In the future, all organs must conduct strict reviews when recruiting service personnel, selecting the children of workers and peasants who are of good character, healthy, and have a certain level of culture. They should never unilaterally emphasize solving the employment problem of the urban population, and recruit people with bad backgrounds and qualities into the organs. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of service personnel, so that every service personnel understands the basic principles of the revolution and establishes the viewpoint of wholeheartedly serving the people. For some people who complain about wages and benefits, are not at ease with their work, and do not abide by labor discipline, their individualism and other bad ideas and habits should be criticized through typical examples. For the few people who persist in their mistakes and refuse to correct them, necessary disciplinary actions should be given. On the cadre side, it is necessary to resolutely get rid of official airs, treat service personnel with an equal attitude, respect their labor, care about their work, study, and life, and help them solve the difficulties and problems that can be solved. Only in this way can we further strengthen the relationship between cadres and service personnel, promote the enthusiasm and initiative of service personnel, and create a good condition for the great leap forward in the work of the organs.

    从“小鬼”谈起
    文宜
    在我们的革命队伍里，“小鬼”这个称呼曾经流行很久，它体现着干部和勤务人员之间的亲密的关系。但是近几年来，这个称呼渐渐听不到了，把年纪小的勤务人员叫做“小鬼”的干部愈来愈少，而许多勤务人员也不愿意被人叫做“小鬼”。问题倒不在于能不能听到这个称呼，而在于勤务人员和干部之间关系不像从前那样亲密了，尤其值得注意的是许多勤务人员的政治觉悟低，工作热情不高。虽然大部分勤务人员工作是积极的，对社会主义建设有一定贡献，但从这次整风运动中各机关清查出的一些品质恶劣的坏分子来看，问题还是相当严重的。他们有的在机关内部播弄是非或盗窃公私财物；有的不遵守公共生活的规则，甚至调戏和侮辱妇女。他们的行为破坏了机关工作的秩序，沾污了国家机关工作人员的荣誉。这样的坏分子在勤务人员中固然只是少数，但是仅仅这少数害群之马，已经给国家机关造成了严重的损失，因此不能不引起大家注意。
    为什么在勤务人员中会出现这些现象呢？这需要对勤务人员的情况加以分析。过去被叫做
  “小鬼”的勤务人员，虽然年纪小，文化程度低，但是政治觉悟都是比较高的。他们把勤务工作看作整个革命工作的一部分，懂得作好了这一部分工作，就为革命增加了一份力量。因此，他们一般都很热爱自己的工作，并且都以能作“小八路”“小红鬼”而自豪。解放以后新吸收的勤务人员的情况就不完全是这样了。他们中间的许多人，是抱着各种不同的动机来参加工作的。有些人是单纯地为了“挣工资”，有些人是为了当干部；有些人为了进城来过“好生活”的。不少人把勤务工作看作是“下等”工作、“侍候人”的工作。他们现在所以作这种工作是迫不得已，只要有机会，就要求调换工作。而在机关生活中，同过去的情况也有所不同，例如工作紧张，居住分散，缺少共同活动的机会，这是一个方面，可是更主要的，是在一些干部中，也确实有一部分人轻视勤务人员的工作。这些干部以官老爷自居，不是用平等的态度对待勤务人员。这也引起了勤务人员的反感，助长了他们的不正确思想和自卑感。这样一来，干部和勤务人员的关系当然不会很密切，勤务人员的革命热情也就受到了一定影响。
    更重要的，许多机关放松甚至放弃了对勤务人员的管理和教育工作，吸收勤务人员时不注意审查政治质量，平日又放松了对勤务人员的政治思想教育工作。许多勤务人员参加工作已经几年，可是思想觉悟不但没有提高，而且在资产阶级思想影响之下，坏思想坏作风还有了发展。更有少数思想品质恶劣的分子，也乘机混进了机关勤务人员的队伍，几年来在机关和社会上作了许多坏事，今后各机关吸收勤务人员，要进行严格的审查，选择品质优良、体格健壮而又有一定文化的工农子弟，决不应该片面强调解决城市人口就业问题，把出身和品质都不好的人也吸收到机关中来。同时要加强对勤务人员的政治思想教育，使每个勤务人员都懂得革命的基本道理，树立起全心全意为人民服务的观点。对于某些闹工资待遇、不安心工作和不遵守劳动纪律的人，要通过典型事例，对他们的个人主义等等坏思想坏作风进行批判。对于少数坚持错误不肯改正的人，要给予必要的纪律处分。在干部方面，则要坚决打掉官气，以平等的态度对待勤务人员，尊重他们的劳动，关心他们的工作、学习和生活，帮助他们解决能够解决的困难和问题。只有这样，才能进一步密切干部和勤务人员的关系，发扬勤务人员的积极性和主动性，为机关工作的大跃进创造一个良好的条件。
