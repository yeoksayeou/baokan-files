Completing Ten Years' Task in One Year
Jiang Ke, Second Secretary of the Feidong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Feidong County is located in the Huainan area of ​​Anhui Province. The county's water conservancy construction work last winter and this spring has been a great leap forward. The county originally planned to complete 12 million cubic meters of earthwork, but now it has exceeded 100 million cubic meters and is about to complete 150 million cubic meters. This is more than ten times the original plan and twice the total of water conservancy projects built in the eight years since liberation. The National Agricultural Development Program stipulates the elimination of waterlogging and drought disasters within ten years. We have basically achieved this in just over four months. Last winter and this spring, the county built and renovated more than 36,000 ponds and dams, increasing the original water storage capacity, so that more than 80% of the county's 2.05 million mu of fields can be guaranteed a harvest even if it does not rain for sixty consecutive days. The vast number of cadres and the masses are excitedly saying, "This year is truly a turnaround for ponds and dams, uprooting the root cause of drought for nine years out of ten," "We have completed ten years of work in one year; we would never have dreamed of this without cooperativization."

In water conservancy construction, the Feidong County Party Committee, in addition to repeatedly checking and criticizing the conservative ideas existing among cadres and the masses through rectification and consolidation of communes, has also carried out conscientious and specific leadership work from beginning to end, implementing the central and provincial party committees' guidelines on water conservancy construction. An important method for us to implement this policy is to summarize and promote the experience of eight townships in the county in eliminating ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters during water conservancy construction.

In the hilly areas of Feidong County, the masses of the Wulong Cooperative in Wulong Township created a method of blocking gullies and building dams. They built dams where water sources converge between two high ridges, thereby intercepting surface runoff and forming a large-area water storage area. This kind of project is simple and easy to implement. In the winter of 1956, the Wulong Cooperative used 600 workdays to excavate more than 1,000 cubic meters of earth and built three gully-blocking dams, storing 1.5 to 1.7 square kilometers of floodwater, with a storage capacity of up to 340,000 cubic meters. This water storage method does not occupy cultivated land. The fields used for water storage are left idle in winter and spring and can be used for transplanting seedlings in summer. Because its water level is high, it can supply water to both higher and lower fields and ponds through ditches. The Wulong Cooperative uses ditches to enable 75% of the cooperative's fields and ponds to draw on floodwater, turning stagnant ponds into flowing ponds, water-wheeling fields into water-releasing fields, and dry land into rice paddies. The masses of the Feiguang Cooperative in Shanwang Township created a method of merging ponds, gradually merging forty-eight adjacent small ponds into one large pond. This is also an effective water management method. After merging ponds, this cooperative removed more than 30 pond embankments, increasing the water storage area from more than 120 mu to more than 140 mu, increasing the water storage capacity by more than double, and increasing the irrigation area by two times compared to the original, enabling rice yields to increase from an average single-crop yield of 150 jin to 460 jin. Because the water storage capacity increased, many fields were transformed from fields irrigated by waterwheels to fields irrigated by water release. The method of merging ponds saves labor during repairs and is also more convenient to manage because the pond embankments are greatly reduced. The masses also created a method of raising the embankments of flood-prone fields. They take advantage of the annual habit of repairing flood-prone field embankments in the spring to raise them and store more spring water, so that flood-prone fields do not need pond water for transplanting seedlings. This is a method that saves labor and can store water over a large area.

The masses in Daxing and Changle Townships in the polder area built embankments to connect adjacent polder dikes, thus connecting many small polders into large polders. This method has many benefits. After Daxing and Changle Townships connected small polders into large polders, the polder embankments were reduced, shortening the flood control line by more than 10,000 meters, saving a lot of labor and materials for flood control during the flood season, and also facilitating the raising and thickening of the polder embankments to make them more solid during normal times.

The four townships in the mountainous area, including Fuxing and Shanwang, used methods such as planting more trees, raising grass to protect slopes, building valley check dams, small reservoirs, building dams with random rocks in mountain gullies to block water, and diverting floodwater to irrigate ponds to basically eliminate floods, soil erosion, and drought disasters. The masses happily said, "The power of cooperativization is great, digging ditches to divert floodwater fills the ponds, and in the past, sweet potatoes were planted in the fields, but now rice seedlings can be planted."

The masses in eight townships in Feidong, including Hubin, Fuxing, Changle, Daxing, Shanwang, Wulong, Gaoliang, and Xiejie, used the above-mentioned water management methods to basically eliminate ordinary drought and flood disasters in 1957. After studying and summarizing their experiences, the county party committee believed that these methods all conformed to the water management policy of focusing on small-scale projects and relying on the masses. They achieved the goals of both drought and flood prevention, both water storage and flood discharge, and they were cost-effective, easy to implement, and quick to achieve results. Therefore, from the beginning of water conservancy construction last winter, the experiences of these eight townships were promoted in accordance with the principles of "comprehensive development, comprehensive management," "engineering security," and "lasting benefits." At present, 328 gully-blocking dams have been built throughout the county. This one item alone can store more than 1.4 million cubic meters of water, ensuring that more than 200,000 mu of fields do not need pond water for transplanting seedlings. This year, Shuangdun Township built the Caitang gully-blocking dam, storing 7 million cubic meters of water, benefiting 50,000 mu, with only 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork. On average, each cubic meter of earthwork stores 28 cubic meters of water, which is more than ten times higher than the effect of storing two cubic meters of water for every cubic meter of earthwork carried in a normal pond. The linking of ponds and merging of polders have also achieved results throughout the county. Various places have adapted to local conditions to remove embankments and deepen more than 4,400 small ponds, merging them into more than 1,900 large ponds. More than 1,300 ponds are connected by excavated ditches. Through this method, more than 30 million cubic meters of water storage has been added to the original water storage base, improving and expanding the irrigation area of ​​210,000 mu. After 76 small polders in the county were merged into 25 large polders, more than 10,000 mu of polder fields were added, and the flood control line was reduced by 150 li. These small earthwork projects are all managed by the masses themselves, and according to inspections, the quality is mostly very good.

Because the county has basically eliminated water and drought disasters, it has further encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. The masses said, "Yugong removing mountains has existed since ancient times, and Yu the Great's water control has left a good name," but after this year's water conservancy construction, "from now on, we will not worry about drought or flood, and future generations will celebrate a bumper harvest." The vast number of cadres and masses are carrying out more in-depth and meticulous water conservancy projects.

    十年任务一年完成
    中共肥东县委第二书记　姜克
    肥东县在安徽省淮南地区，全县去冬今春兴修水利的工作是一个大跃进。县里原订计划要作一千二百多万方土的工程，现在却已突破一亿方土，要完成一亿五千万方土了。这就等于原计划的十倍多，等于解放八年来兴修水利工程总和的二倍。全国农业发展纲要规定，在十年内消灭水旱灾害，我们在四个多月的时间内就基本实现了。去冬今春全县新建和整修了三万六千多处塘坝工程，增加和原有的蓄水量，使全县二百零五万亩田中的80％以上在连续六十天不雨的情下，可以达到保收。广大干部和群众都兴奋地说：“今年真是塘翻身，坝翻身，拔掉了十年九旱的根”，“我们一年干完了十年的事，要不是合作化，做梦也想不到。”
    肥东县委在兴修水利中，除通过整风整社，一再检查批判干部和群众中存在的保守思想外，还自始至终进行了认真具体的领导工作，贯彻了中央和省委关于兴修水利的方针。我们贯彻这一方针的一个重要办法，便是在兴修水利中总结推广本县八个乡消灭普通水旱灾害的经验。
    肥东县丘陵地区，乌龙乡乌龙社的群众创造了拦冲打坝的办法。他们利用两个高岗之间水源汇集的地方筑坝，便拦蓄了地面径流，构成大面积蓄水区。这种工程简便易行，乌龙社1956年冬用了六百个劳动日，挖土一千多公方，便打了三道拦冲坝，蓄起了一点五到一点七平方公里的花水，蓄水量可达三十四万公方。这种蓄水办法并不占用耕地面积，蓄水的田里冬春蓄闲水，夏天就可用来栽秧。因为它的水位高，通过沟渠对较高和较低的田、塘都可供水，乌龙社利用沟渠使全社75％的田和塘都能引用冲水，把死水塘变成活水塘，车水田变成放水田，旱地变成水稻田。山王乡肥光社群众创造的并塘办法，把四十八个互相毗邻的小塘逐步并成了一口大塘。这也是一个有效的治水办法。这个社并塘后，挖去了三十多条塘埂，蓄水面积由原来的一百二十多亩增加到一百四十多亩，蓄水量提高一倍多，比原来灌溉面积增加了二倍，使水稻产量由平均单产一百五十斤提高到四百六十斤。因为蓄水量增加，许多田由车水灌田变成了放水灌田。并塘的办法在培修时节省劳力，在管理上也比较方便，因为塘埂大大减少。群众还创造了加高冲田埂的办法。他们利用每年春上补修冲田埂的习惯进行加高，多蓄春水，使冲田栽秧不用塘水，这是一个既省工又可大面积蓄水的办法。
    圩区的大兴、长乐等乡的群众，把一个个邻近的圩堤，筑埂连起来，便把许多小圩联成了大圩。这种办法的好处是很多的。大兴、长乐两乡把小圩联成大圩后，圩埂减少了，缩短了一万多公尺的防洪线，在汛期节省了很多防汛的劳力、物力，在平时也便于对圩埂加高培厚，作到巩固。
    山区的复兴、山王等四乡利用多植树木、养草护坡、修建谷坊、小型水库、在山沟节节用乱石打坝拦水和引洪灌塘等办法，基本上消灭了洪灾、水土流失和旱灾。群众高兴的说：“合作化力量大，开沟引洪灌满塘，过去田里栽山芋，现在能够栽稻秧。”
    肥东湖滨、复兴、长乐、大兴、山王、乌龙、高亮、解集等八个乡的群众，利用上述的治水方法，在1957年就达到基本上消灭了普通旱、涝灾害。县委研究总结他们的经验后，认为这些办法都符合以小型为主，依靠群众的治水方针，它既做到了防旱与防涝并重、蓄水与排洪并重，又达到了花钱少，受益大，易办到，收效快的要求。所以从去年冬一开始修水利，就根据“全面发展、综合治理”“工程安家、效益有着”的原则，因地制宜地推广了这八个乡的经验。目前全县已拦冲打坝三百二十八处，单这一项就可多蓄一千四百多公方的水，保证二十多万亩田栽秧不用塘水。双墩乡今年修建蔡塘拦冲坝，拦蓄七百万方水，受益五万亩，只做了二十五万方土，平均每方土蓄水二十八方，比一般塘挑一方土蓄二方水的效益高了十多倍。联塘、并圩也在全县取得成绩，各地因地制宜地将四千四百多处小塘去埂挖深，合并为一千九百多个大塘，挖沟相连的塘有一千三百多个，通过这一办法，在原蓄水基础上就增加了三千多万方蓄水，改善和扩大二十一万亩的灌溉面积；全县有七十六个小圩并成二十五个大圩后，增加圩田一万多亩，缩小防洪线一百五十华里。这些小型土方工程都由群众自办，根据检查，质量绝大部分都是很好的。
    全县因为作到了基本消灭水、旱灾害，更加鼓舞了干部和群众的干劲。群众说：“愚公移山自古有，禹王治水美名留”，但经过今年兴修水利，“从今后，旱涝两不愁，子孙万代庆丰收。”广大干部和群众正在进行更深入细致的水利工程。
