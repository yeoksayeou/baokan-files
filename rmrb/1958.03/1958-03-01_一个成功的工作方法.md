In the movement against waste and conservatism, an imbalance has also emerged: some units are doing very well, some are doing not so well, and some are doing very poorly. This phenomenon is not surprising; the question is how leaders can enable advanced units to help backward units catch up with or surpass advanced units, so that the movement can continuously advance.

There are many ways to solve this problem, and holding "on-site meetings" is a successful method.

Currently, some people still do not fully recognize the significance of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement as the guiding principle for all work. When they encounter specific tasks, they cannot understand it, saying things like: "We are busy with our work and don't have time to fight waste!" "Fighting waste will delay our work"; or they say that their departments are "clean slate" and there is nothing to fight against. Holding "on-site meetings" can use a series of the most vivid and concrete facts to make these people realize why fighting waste and conservatism is the guiding principle for all work, and realize that there *are* things to fight against in their departments, and that conservative thinking is at play. Isn't that so? After the Party Committee of Central Government Organs held an "on-site meeting" at the Livestock Products Company for more than ten units in the financial, trade, and political-legal systems, many people who originally did not clearly understand the significance of anti-waste and anti-conservatism realized that their units did not lack waste to fight, but rather conservative ideas were the problem.

The reason why the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement progresses slowly in some units is mainly not a problem of ideology, but a problem of method. Although the leading cadres of these units understand the ideas and also understand that the waste and conservative phenomena in their units are very serious, they lack methods or the methods are not correct. Therefore, the enthusiasm for anti-waste and anti-conservatism is always not great, unlike other agencies that are in full swing. Through "on-site meetings," these units can learn good working methods from advanced units.

"On-site meetings" are also comparison meetings. Many units, even those that have not done well in fighting waste, still think they are doing okay when they are behind closed doors. But when they go out and compare themselves with others, they will realize that they are not doing well and should catch up quickly. The fact that a few backward units of state organs have jumped to become advanced units after the Party Committee held "on-site meetings" is the best proof.

    一个成功的工作方法
    宜勤
  在反浪费、反保守运动中，同样出现了不平衡的状态：一些单位搞得很好，一些单位搞得不大好，一些单位搞得很不好。这种现象并不奇怪，问题是在于领导上如何使先进单位帮助落后单位赶上先进单位或超过先进单位，使运动不断地前进。
    解决这个问题的方法很多，召开“现场会议”是一个成功的方法。
    现在，还有一些人对于反浪费、反保守是带动一切工作的纲的意义认识不足，一接触到具体工作，就想不通了，说什么：“我们业务忙，没有时间反浪费！”“反浪费会耽误工作”；或者说他们的机关是“清水衙门”，根本没有东西可反。召开“现场会议”，就可以通过一系列最生动、具体的事实，使这些人认识到为什么反浪费、反保守是带动一切工作的纲，认识到他们机关不是没有东西可反，而是大有可反。不是吗？中央国家机关党委在畜产公司召开了财贸、政法系统十多个单位的“现场会议”以后，许多原来对反浪费、反保守意义认识不清的人，都认识到自己单位并不是没有浪费可反，而是保守思想在作怪。
    也有些单位的反浪费、反保守运动所以进展不快，主要不是思想问题，而是方法问题，这些单位的领导干部虽然思想通了，也了解本单位的浪费和保守现象很严重，但是，缺少办法，或者办法不对头。因此，反浪费、反保守的劲头总是不大，不像其他机关那样轰轰烈烈。通过“现场会议”，这些单位就可以向先进单位学到好的工作方法。
    “现场会议”又是个评比会议。许多单位，即使反浪费搞得很不好的单位，当他关着门的时候，还觉得自己搞得差不多，可是当他走出大门，同人家比一比以后，就会发觉自己搞得不好，应当急起直追。国家机关的少数落后单位在党委召开“现场会议”以后，就一跃而成为先进单位，就是一个最好的证明。
