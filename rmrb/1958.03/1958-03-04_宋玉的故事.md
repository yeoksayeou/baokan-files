    The Story of Song Yu
    Fu Da

    In the old society, there was a popular saying that called "licentious" people "Deng Tuzi," the implication of which was as bad as "hooligan." Deng Tuzi was originally a minister with the rank of Daifu in the State of Chu during the Warring States period. "Deng Tu" was his surname, and "Zi" was the same as in Confucius (Kongzi) and Mencius (Mengzi). Just how bad was Daifu Deng Tuzi? It was too long ago, more than two thousand years, and there are very few historical materials about him, so it's not clear. Only a rhapsody, supposedly written by Song Yu, mentioned him, and it was because of this article that this Daifu Deng was notorious for two thousand years.

    However, based solely on this piece of writing – "Rhapsody on Deng Tuzi's Lustfulness" – one cannot see how bad this person was. Song Yu, who commented on him, mentioned almost nothing about Deng Tuzi's politics, knowledge, or moral character. He only criticized him based on a whimsical incident. In order to defend himself, Song Yu did not hesitate to smear the other person's name, associating Deng Tuzi with "lustfulness."

    "Rhapsody on Lustfulness" is written as follows (translated in essence):

    Daifu Deng Tuzi criticized Song Yu in front of the King of Chu, saying, "Song Yu is handsome, eloquent, and fond of women. I hope Your Majesty will not let him enter and exit the harem." After hearing Deng Tuzi's words, the King of Chu asked Song Yu about it. Song Yu said, "Being handsome is innate; being eloquent is taught by a teacher; as for being fond of women, I absolutely am not." The King of Chu said, "If you say you are not lustful, what evidence do you have? If you have evidence, it counts; if not, please go home." Song Yu replied, "The beauties of the world are no match for those of Chu; the beauties of Chu are no match for those of my hometown; the beauties of my hometown are no match for the girl next door to my house in the east. That girl is too tall if you add even a fraction, and too short if you subtract even a fraction; she is too white if she puts on powder, and too red if she applies rouge; her eyebrows are like kingfisher feathers, and her skin is like white snow; her smile can fascinate all the men in Yangcheng and Xi Cai. But this girl has been peeking at me over the wall for three years, and I have not paid her any attention. But what about Daifu Deng Tuzi? His wife has disheveled hair, a cleft lip, a hunched back, is covered in scabies, and suffers from hemorrhoids. Yet Deng Tuzi has had five children with her. From this, Your Majesty can judge who is lustful."

    The article goes on to say that the King of Chu believed these words, and Song Yu's position was stabilized. Deng Tuzi was the one who was wronged, and his name became synonymous with hooliganism. Of course, Deng Tuzi himself was not good either, as he was the one who first spoke ill of Song Yu in front of the King of Chu.

    What is strange is that readers throughout history have believed Song Yu's evaluation of his opponent and have never doubted the one-sided method he adopted. According to Song Yu's view, if a person has a shortcoming, even if it is minor (and even whether it is a real shortcoming is worth considering), then any of their advantages can be ignored, and they can be judged as a bad egg.

    This is an extremely unfair, erroneous, and dangerous way of thinking—a one-sided way of thinking. But this method of viewing people and things, and of commenting on people and things, has its universality. Don't the bourgeois rightists have this common characteristic? They cannot see the big and main achievements, only the partial, temporary, and minor shortcomings, and they exaggerate the latter as much as possible, so that they portray socialist society as a total darkness. Of course, for them, in addition to the issue of methodology, there are also fundamental issues of position and world view. They are hostile to the new society, and their class instincts make them hate all the policies and measures of the Party and the government, so it is impossible for them to look at problems objectively and comprehensively. They can't wait for the new society to collapse, so how can they be in the mood to pay attention to the fact that it is fundamentally healthy and has unlimited development prospects? But besides the rightists, there are also quite a few people who have the problem of one-sided thinking. Chairman Mao summarized the characteristics of this method as: attacking one point, exaggerating it as much as possible, and ignoring the rest. Using this method to conduct criticism will never achieve good results, it will only produce side effects and damage the people's cause. Chairman Mao cited the story of Song Yu as an example to teach us to gradually learn to look at problems with dialectics, to understand the principle of one finger among ten fingers, to analyze things, to make a comprehensive assessment, and to recognize the essence and the mainstream of things, which is of great educational significance.

    宋玉的故事
    傅达
    旧社会里流行一个说法，把“好色”的人叫做“登徒子”，含意之坏，和“流氓”差不多。登徒子原是战国时代楚国一个官阶为大夫的臣子。“登徒”是姓，“子”就是孔子、孟子的“子”。大夫登徒子究竟坏得怎样呢？年代太久远了，二千多年以前，关于他的史料又很少，所以搞不清楚，只有据说是宋玉写的一篇赋里提到他，而且也就因为这篇文章使这位登徒大夫遗臭二千年。
    但是，光凭这篇东西——“登徒子好色赋”，却看不出这人怎么坏。评论他的宋玉，对登徒子的政治、学问、道德品行各个方面，几乎什么也没有提，只是异想天开地举了一件事批评他。宋玉为了辩护自己，不惜把人家的鼻子抹白，把登徒子和“好色”联系在一起。
    “好色赋”里这样写道（译其大意）：
    大夫登徒子在楚王面前批评宋玉说：“宋玉这人模样儿长得漂亮，能说会道，又喜爱女色，愿我王不要和他一起出入后宫。”楚王听了登徒子这番话就去问宋玉。宋玉道：“模样儿长得漂亮，是天生的；能说会道，是老师教的；至于喜爱女色，我绝对没有这回事。”楚王道：“你自己说不好色，可有什么证据呢？有证据就算，没有的话，请你回家。”宋玉答道：“天下的美人儿，再也比不上楚国的；楚国的美人儿，再也比不上我家乡的；我家乡的美人儿，再也比不上我家东邻的姑娘。那位姑娘再加一分就嫌高，减一分就嫌短，扑了粉就太白，搽了胭脂就太红，眉毛像翠羽，皮肤像白雪，她的微笑能使整个阳城和下蔡的男人都着迷。但是这位姑娘攀墙偷看我三年之久，我至今没有理她。可是登徒大夫又是怎样呢？他老婆蓬头乱发，豁嘴露齿，弯腰曲背，满身疥疮，又害痔病。登徒子却同她生了五个孩子。从这里我王可以判明到底谁好色了。”
    文章接着写到，楚王相信了这些话，宋玉的地位得到了稳定，受冤屈的是登徒子，从此他的姓名变成了流氓的代名词。当然，登徒子自己也不好，是他先在楚王面前说宋玉的坏话。
    奇怪的是历来的读者竟然相信宋玉对于他对手的评价，也从不怀疑他所采用的这种片面的方法。按照宋玉的看法，一个人有了一个缺点，即使是次要的（甚至是不是真的缺点也还值得考虑），那就可以对他的任何优点一律不问不闻，而把他判为一个坏蛋。
    这是一种极其不公平的错误的危险的思想方法——就是片面性的思想方法。但是这种看人看事、论人论事的方法却有它的普遍性。资产阶级右派分子不就有这个共同的特点吗？他们看不见大的、主要的成绩，只看见局部的、暂时的、次要的缺点，并且把后者尽量加以夸大，结果就把社会主义社会说成黑漆一团。当然，对他们说来，除了思想方法问题外，还有立场、世界观的根本问题。他们对新社会是敌视的，他们的阶级本能使他们仇恨党和政府的一切政策措施，因此决不可能客观地全面地看问题。他们恨不得新社会垮台，哪有心情去理会它基本上是健康的，有无限发展前途呢？但是除了右派以外，具有思想片面性的毛病的人也不在少数。毛主席概括这种方法的特点是：攻其一点，尽量夸大，不及其余。用这种方法来进行批评，决不能得到好效果，只会产生副作用，损害人民的事业。毛主席举宋玉的故事为例，教导我们要逐渐学会用辩证法看问题，要懂得十个指头当中一个指头的道理，要对事物作分析，要作全面的估量，要认识事物的本质和主流，是有很大的教育意义的。
