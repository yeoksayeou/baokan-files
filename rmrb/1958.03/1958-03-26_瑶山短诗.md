    Yao Mountain Short Poems
    Han Xiao
    A crescent moon at dawn, scattered cold stars, the night sky is black velvet. On the blue stone road, footsteps thud, Yao compatriots go to the fields early. The rooster hasn't opened its eyes, yet it hurriedly sings "The East is Red."
    Terraces are like pieces of jade paving the blue sky, Yao compatriots walk back and forth on them, it is impossible to distinguish between heaven and earth.
    Night dance, golden red fire, light cyan smoke, the sound of gongs and drums excites the mountains, people are dancing, trees are dancing, the wind is dancing, and the Greater Yao Mountains are also stretching their muscles and bones.
    A midwife carrying a small leather bag climbs the mountain. What is it for, so excited, so hurried? Because she welcomes new life, her hair is white, but her face is full of radiance.

    瑶山短诗
    韩笑
    黎明一弯冷月，点点寒星，夜空是黑色的天鹅绒。青石路上，脚步咚咚，瑶胞早起到田中。雄鸡没睁开眼睛，就慌忙唱起东方红。
    梯田像一块块碧玉铺上青天，瑶胞踏着它来去，分不清天堂和人间。
    夜舞金红的火，淡青的烟，声声锣鼓激动了峰峦，人在舞，树在舞，风在舞，大瑶山也在把筋骨舒展。
    接生员提一个小皮箱，爬上了山岗。为的什么事呀，那么兴奋，那么匆忙？因为她迎接新的生命，头发白了，却满面红光。
