Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: Artists and scientific research workers in drama, music, fine arts, dance, folk art, and other fields from various regions held a meeting in Beijing from the 15th to the 19th to discuss the great leap forward in artistic and scientific research. They proposed to artistic and scientific research workers across the country: Pay attention to summarizing the experiences of artistic practice and further exert the guiding role of theory in artistic practice.

In their proposal, they put forward ten goals to strive for: Guarantee that research work is closely linked to artistic practice, and according to actual needs, research and solve the problems occurring in current artistic practice; at the same time, summarize historical experience and study the laws of development of Chinese art. It is necessary to carry out both systematic and fundamental research, and also pay attention to the popularization of artistic theory. Give full play to the work potential of veteran experts, and also encourage young researchers to learn while doing, and expand the ranks of theoretical workers. Achieve goals in every field, plans for everyone, "let a hundred flowers bloom," and cooperate with each other; conscientiously study and master Marxism-Leninism, wage a resolute struggle against revisionism and various bourgeois ideologies, and oppose dogmatism. Under the leadership of the Party, art science workers should actively participate in political movements, strive to delve into their professional work, and be both red and expert, red to the core and deeply specialized.

More than 350 representatives from art science research institutions and art colleges from various regions participated in the meeting, and 37 people spoke at the meeting. Ouyang Yuqian, deputy leader of the Cultural Ministry's Art Science Research Leading Group and president of the Central Academy of Drama, criticized the current erroneous tendencies in art science research work that emphasize personal interests, detachment from reality, detachment from politics, and improvement behind closed doors in his speech.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, made a concluding speech at the meeting on the 19th. He pointed out that with the great leap forward in ideology, a leap forward in artistic quality and technology is required, so artistic and scientific research work must keep up closely. Not only art science research departments, but all art performance groups should conduct art research work regularly in the future. Liu Zhiming said that the fundamental purpose of art science research work is to study how to establish a socialist national new art and how this new art can serve socialist construction, so it is necessary to strengthen its realism, combat effectiveness, and creativity.

    加强现实性战斗性创造性
    艺术科学工作者提出十条努力目标
    据新华社20日讯　各地戏剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈、曲艺等方面的艺术科学研究工作者15日到19日在北京开会讨论了艺术科学研究工作大跃进的问题。他们向全国艺术科学研究工作者倡议：注意总结艺术实践的经验，进一步发挥理论在艺术实践中的指导作用。
    他们在倡议书中提出了十条努力目标：保证使研究工作同艺术实践密切联系，根据实际需要，研究、解决当前艺术实践中发生的问题；同时要总结历史经验，研究中国艺术的发展规律。既要进行系统的根本性的研究，也要注意艺术理论普及工作。要充分发挥老专家的工作潜力，也要鼓励青年研究人员边做边学，扩大理论工作者队伍。要做到门门有目标，人人有规划，百家争鸣，互相协作；认真学习和掌握马克思列宁主义，同修正主义以及各种资产阶级思想作坚决斗争，并反对教条主义。艺术科学工作者应在党的领导下，积极参加政治运动，努力钻研业务，做到又红又专，红透专深。
    参加这次会议的有各地艺术科学研究机构、艺术院校的代表等共三百五十多人，有三十七人在会上发了言。文化部艺术科学研究领导小组副组长、中央戏剧学院院长欧阳予倩在发言中批判了当前艺术科学研究工作中强调个人兴趣、脱离实际、脱离政治、关门提高等错误倾向。
    文化部副部长刘芝明19日在会上作了总结发言。他指出，随着思想上的大跃进，接着就要求艺术质量上、技术上的跃进，因此艺术科学研究工作就必须紧紧跟上。不仅艺术科学研究部门，今后在所有的艺术表演团体中都要经常进行艺术研究工作。刘芝明说，艺术科学研究工作的根本目的是研究怎样建立起社会主义的民族的新文艺和这种新文艺如何为社会主义建设服务，因此就必须加强它的现实性、战斗性和创造性。
