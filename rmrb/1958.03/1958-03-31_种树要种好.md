    Planting Trees Must Be Done Well

    The afforestation and greening work in Yuxian County, Henan, is always started with great fanfare but ends without results; this has been the case for years. For example, when the Yu-Xu Highway was newly built in 1956, various saplings were planted, but they were green when planted and turned dry after only a few days. Some only had half a tree trunk left, and some even lost their roots. In 1957, various saplings were planted again on the riverbanks, city walls, and roads, but because no one took care of them after planting, more died than lived. This year, even more trees have been planted than in previous years. Rows of various saplings have been planted in all the streets of the city, on the city walls, on the riverbanks, along both sides of the roads, and on the edges of the fields of various agricultural cooperatives, which is truly delightful. But what is the lifespan of these saplings? Judging from the current situation, the saplings on the Yu-Xu Highway have already begun to wither. If they are not rescued in time, the saplings are in danger of dying completely. For the sake of long-term interests and to prevent further loss of people's property, I suggest that the relevant departments quickly inspect all the saplings. Those that have withered should be replanted in time, those that have not died should be watered regularly, and education on protecting saplings should be strengthened among the masses so that the saplings can grow up quickly.

    种树要种好
    河南禹县的植树绿化工作总是虎头蛇尾，栽上就不管了，而且连年如此。如1956年禹许公路新修通时就栽上了各种树苗，可是栽时是绿的，停不几天就变成干的了。有的光剩半截树身子，有的连树根也不见了。1957年，河岸上、城墙上、公路上，照样又栽上了各种树苗，由于栽上没人管，活的没有死的多。今年栽的比往年还要多，城关各街、城墙上、河岸上、公路两旁、各农业社的地头都栽上了一排排的各种树苗，真是令人喜爱。但是这些树苗的寿命如何呢？根据目前情况看，禹许公路上的树苗已经开始枯干了，如不及时抢救，树苗有全部死去的危险。为了长远利益，为了人民财产不再受损失，我建议有关部门迅速把所有树苗检查一次，已经枯死的要及时补种起来，未死的要经常进行浇灌，并对群众加强保护树苗的教育，让树苗很快的成长起来吧。
