    Antaeus: A famous hero in ancient Greek mythology. Legend says his father was the god of the sea, and his mother was the goddess of the earth. Whenever he encountered difficulties in battles with enemies, he would gain a new surge of strength simply by leaning on the ground. His enemy, Hercules, discovered his weakness and devised a way to lift him into the air, preventing him from touching the ground again. As a result, he was strangled to death in the air. Stalin cited this story in his article "On the shortcomings of Party work and measures to eliminate the Trotskyist double-dealers and other double-dealers" when discussing the necessity for the Party to maintain close ties with the masses.

    安泰　古代希腊神话中的著名英雄。传说他的父亲是海神，母亲是地神。他在与敌人决斗遇到困难时，只要往地上一靠，就取得一股新的力量。他的敌人盖尔枯里斯，发现了他的弱点，就设法把他举到空中，使他无法再同地面接触，结果，便在空中把他扼死。斯大林在“论党的工作的缺点和消灭托洛斯基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”一文中谈到党必须同群众保持密切联系的时候曾经引用了这个故事。
