The All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction Calls on Members to Engage in Self-Remolding Competition
Striving to Become Laborers in Three Years

(Our Newspaper News) The Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction held its 40th Standing Committee (Enlarged) Meeting on the afternoon of February 28th. The meeting called on organizations at all levels to lead members in launching a great competition for self-remolding, throwing themselves into the great leap forward in production and construction, and striving to be transformed into self-reliant laborers in name and in fact within three years. The meeting unanimously resolved to issue a circular. The circular stated: The Standing Committee held a meeting on February 28th, inviting Central Committee members in Beijing to participate. The meeting discussed the new situations emerging among our members and industrialists and businessmen, as well as the proposals of members in Shanghai. It was unanimously agreed that all members should be called upon to take action and strive for advancement in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. To this end, the Standing Committee requires all members to actively respond to the proposals of the Shanghai members, formulate remolding plans based on specific circumstances, and take practical actions to compete with the Shanghai members. They should strive to ensure that, in 1958, the political stance of the majority of people is fundamentally shifted from the side of the bourgeoisie to the side of the working class, and that within three years, through personal efforts, organizational assistance, and mass supervision, the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie is transformed into the one-sidedness of the proletariat. The half-hearted attitude towards the leadership of the Party and the socialist road should be transformed into wholeheartedness, becoming laborers who are worthy of the name and self-reliant.
    
The circular concluded by saying that we also require organizations in various regions to learn from the leadership methods of organizations in Shanghai and other places, recognize the characteristics of the current situation's development, vigorously overcome conservative thinking, and use every means to encourage members' awareness and enthusiasm for self-remolding. They should transform remolding forms such as formulating individual remolding plans and evaluation competitions into mass actions, and transform these mass actions into objective situations that promote self-remolding.

    民建中央号召会员自我改造竞赛
    力争三年成为劳动者
    本报讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会2月28日下午举行第四十次常委（扩大）会议，号召各地组织领导会员掀起一个自我改造大竞赛，投入生产建设大跃进，力争三年内改造成为名实相符自食其力的劳动者。会议一致决议发出通函。通函中说：中央常务委员会于2月28日举行会议，约请在京中央委员参加，就当前我会会员和工商业者中所出现的新情况和上海会员的倡议进行了讨论，一致认为应当号召全体会员行动起来，在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命中力争上游。为此，中央常务委员会要求全体会员积极的响应上海市会员的倡议，根据具体情况，制定改造规划，以实际的行动，同上海会员展开竞赛，力争在1958年内，使多数人的政治立场基本上从资产阶级的一方转到工人阶级的一方来，在三年内通过个人努力、组织帮助、群众监督，把资产阶级的两面性改造为无产阶级的一面性。把对党的领导和走社会主义道路的三心两意改造为全心全意，成为名实相符、自食其力的劳动者。
    通函最后说，我们也要求各地组织学习上海等地组织的领导方法，认清当前形势发展的特点，大力克服保守思想，用尽一切办法来鼓励会员自我改造的自觉性和积极性，把制定个人改造规划、评比竞赛等改造形式变为群众性行动，并把这种群众性的行动，变成为促进自我改造的客观形势。
