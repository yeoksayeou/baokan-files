The Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee thoroughly exposed the anti-Party clique of Li Shinong (Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, Deputy Governor), Yang Xiaochun (Member of the Provincial Party Committee, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Chief Procurator of the Province), Li Rui (Member of the Provincial Party Committee, Deputy Chief Procurator of the Province), Chen Rengang (former Party Secretary and Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Justice, already expelled from the Party and removed from his position), and others, and shattered their criminal anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. This is a major victory for our Party. It is of extremely great significance for purifying the Party organization, consolidating the Party's unity, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and promoting the development of the socialist cause.

The crimes of this anti-Party clique are extremely serious. For a long time, they have been plotting to undermine the people's democratic dictatorship, endanger the Party's organization, and oppose the Party's guidelines and policies. When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party last May, their anti-Party activities reached their peak.

According to the revelations at the meeting: Li Shinong was the head of this anti-Party clique. He colluded with his cronies and used his power to condone a large number of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. In order to carry out his crime of condoning counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, he tampered with the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He changed the policy of combining suppression with leniency to one of only leniency, not suppression; he changed the principle of "suppressing those who are counter-revolutionary, correcting all mistakes" to "not suppressing those who are counter-revolutionary, correcting even when there is no mistake." He also frequently spread the fallacy of abolishing the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and exonerating counter-revolutionaries, saying such things as "not even one remnant counter-revolutionary can be found for sure," "the determination of counter-revolutionaries is getting weaker and weaker," "counter-revolutionaries have two sides," and "counter-revolutionaries working in my organization for one more year is equal to atoning for one more year of their crimes." He even personally formulated cases of not sentencing when they should be sentenced and giving light sentences for serious crimes, ordering various localities to imitate them. According to preliminary statistics, as a result of Li Shinong's sinful guidance, more than 2,000 counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements were released throughout the province. As a result of Li Shinong's consistent criminal activities, many cadres were poisoned, and a widespread and serious right-leaning tendency arose in the political and legal departments.

In early 1957, the Provincial Party Committee, in view of the serious right-leaning tendencies in the political and legal departments, decided to launch a criticism campaign. At that time, Li Shinong adopted a double-dealing approach. He did not express his opinion at the Provincial Party Committee meeting, but behind the scenes, he directed his cronies Chen Rengang, Yang Xiaochun, Li Rui, and others to go to various places to "investigate mistakes and oppose the 'Left'," collect anti-Party materials, and, through the procuratorial system, universally register so-called wrongly decided cases that the Party Committee had suggested be dealt with, looking for faults, inciting political and legal cadres to oppose the Provincial Party Committee's decision to combat Right-leaning tendencies, and launching a frenzied attack on the Party. They blatantly slandered that after the Provincial Party Committee put forward the opposition to Right-leaning tendencies, things were "going badly" below, and they did not allow the political and legal departments to transmit the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on opposing Right-leaning tendencies, calling on political and legal cadres to "adhere to principles and not be afraid of losing their official hats." During the period of great blooming and contending last year, their anti-Party arrogance became even more rampant. At the provincial political and legal conference, Li Shinong openly attacked the Provincial Party Committee's policy of opposing Right-leaning tendencies, negating the achievements in opposing Right-leaning tendencies. He clamored: "Deviations have occurred in opposing Right-leaning tendencies, and the Provincial Party Committee should bear the main responsibility." He said that talking about the achievements in opposing Right-leaning tendencies being the main aspect was an "old formula." He openly provoked the relationship between political and legal cadres and the Party Committee, inciting political and legal cadres to confront the Party Committee. He described the correct criticism of the right-leaning ideas of some political and legal cadres by the Party Committees at all levels as "the Party Committee excessively blaming political and legal cadres." He falsely accused the Party Committee of handling cases wrongly and demanded that the Party Committee "admit its mistakes" to the political and legal cadres. In order to carry out his anti-Party activities, he also spread reactionary fallacies such as "after cooperativization, there is no longer a struggle between two roads," the economic foundation has now changed, and the future struggle is only a "struggle between old and new ideas," and the bourgeoisie taking the socialist road is a "voluntary choice of their own class," attempting to abolish class struggle and the proletarian dictatorship.

Not only that, but Li Shinong has also consistently disobeyed the Central Committee's guidelines and policies and undermined the Party's unified leadership on many major issues. During the land reform, he sheltered the interests of the landlord class; during the cooperativization period, he insisted on the capitalist road; in terms of production and disaster relief, he opposed the correct measures of production reform and self-reliance through production; in terms of Party building and cadre work, he distorted the principles of Party building, undermined the Party's purity, and opened the door wide for counter-revolutionaries and bad elements; he tampered with the Party's cadre review principles, condoned traitors and those who surrendered, deleted serious political circumstances from the review conclusions of these people, and even changed "disloyal to the Party" to "loyal to the Party"; he consistently shielded bad people and bad deeds, and did everything possible to cover up and take care of some serious lawbreakers and discipline violators. He deliberately undermined the Party's unity, slandered the leading comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, incited cadres to oppose the Provincial Party Committee, and conspired to usurp the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee; he cultivated personal influence, implemented a factional cadre policy, and attracted backward elements. He sympathized with and supported anyone who was dissatisfied with the Party.

In order to carry out his anti-Party conspiracy, Li Shinong also used the tricks of the exploiting classes, consistently adopting a double-dealing approach, saying one thing to people's faces and another behind their backs, attacking others, elevating himself, and even proclaiming himself a "model Party member." He concealed the Party's punishment of him for a long time, boasting that he had "more virtue than talent." Moreover, he pretended to be simple and honest, posing as a thoroughly self-denying and public-spirited gentleman. This is how he deceived the organization and the trust of the masses.

Yang Xiaochun and Li Rui were two main generals of Li Shinong's anti-Party clique. They colluded with each other, shielded each other, and praised each other for a long time. In addition to the facts already mentioned above, the meeting also revealed many crimes of Yang Xiaochun and Li Rui.

Yang Xiaochun personally condoned more than 100 counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements, wrongly released a large number of people who had been sent to labor re-education, and falsely accused the 1955 campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries of "committing the mistake of expansion." He shielded rightists and even openly promoted rightists who had already been exposed, expanding their anti-Party forces.

Li Rui concealed his landlord family background for a long time. After liberation, he tried his best to shield several bully brothers who owed blood debts and arranged jobs for them. He also introduced many counter-revolutionaries and bad elements into state organs and even promoted obvious rightists. He often refused to approve arrests and prosecutions on the grounds of "internal contradictions among the people," "attempted crimes," and "not serious consequences," exonerating a large number of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, and personally condoning more than 30 criminals. He consistently resisted the decisions of the Provincial Party Committee, turning the Provincial Procuratorate into an independent kingdom, and did his best to incite procuratorial cadres to oppose the Party's leadership and supervision. He conspired to change the nature of the national procuratorial organs and even openly declared that the procuratorial organs were protecting criminals.

The meeting unanimously pointed out that the conspiratorial activities of the anti-Party clique headed by Li Shinong were not accidental, but had deep historical and social roots. Li Shinong and Li Rui both came from landlord families. Although the Party had educated them for a long time, they had always refused to transform themselves, and their exploiting class essence had not changed at all. Li Shinong said during the land reform that his thinking was shaken when his family was classified as a rich peasant (actually a landlord) and his land was confiscated. Li Rui cried bitterly in the anti-bandit and anti-hegemony campaign because his bully family was liquidated. This is the natural expression of their exploiting class thoughts and feelings. During the democratic revolution, although Li Shinong and Li Rui disguised themselves in every possible way and got through, their reactionary essence was also manifested at that time. Li Shinong gave the armed forces organized by the Party to feudal forces in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the Liberation War, when he was working in Huainan, he retreated and fled. Li Rui, like Li Shinong, committed the mistake of flightism. He abandoned his responsible work area at a critical juncture of the war. Yang Xiaochun came from a rich peasant family. After joining the Party, due to not being thoroughly transformed, he had bourgeois extreme individualism. When his personal desires were not satisfied, he became dissatisfied with the Party, hated the Party, opposed the Party, and finally degenerated and took the anti-Party road. It was precisely because some of them adhered to reactionary positions and some degenerated that they naturally colluded and formed an anti-Party clique. When the socialist revolution deepened and the class struggle intensified, their anti-Party activities became more blatant and arrogant, and their reactionary faces were nakedly exposed. During the great blooming and contending last spring, the bourgeois rightists were unwilling to accept the death of the exploitation system and launched a frenzied attack on the Party. Counter-revolutionaries and reactionary elements among landlords and rich peasants also took the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. At the same time, internationally, due to the fact that imperialism used the Hungarian incident to set off an anti-communist climax, and revisionist ideas were rampant for a time, they tried their best to attack the proletarian dictatorship, attack the Party's leadership, and slander Marxism-Leninism. Under such international and domestic circumstances, the Li Shinong anti-Party clique, proceeding from their exploiting class standpoint, took advantage of the momentum of the attacks by rightists outside the Party and, with the help of the revisionist fallacies, launched a more vicious and organized attack on the Party. Therefore, it is not surprising that the formation of this anti-Party clique and their anti-Party activities reached a peak last May. This is the inevitable result of their adherence to the exploiting class position, and it is a reflection of the sharp class struggle at home and abroad within the Party. Their anti-Party activities are an integral part of the bourgeois rightists' attack on the Party. History has ruthlessly proved that they are completely a group of sinister class alien elements and degenerated elements who have been hidden in the Party for a long time.

Before the anti-Party conspiracy of Li Shinong, Yang Xiaochun, and Li Rui was exposed, the Party had repeatedly educated them about their mistakes, especially the mistakes of Li Shinong and Yang Xiaochun. The Party had criticized and punished Li Shinong for the mistake of expanding the suppression of counter-revolutionaries during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the mistake of flightism during the Liberation War. After liberation, he was repeatedly criticized for his ambiguous attitude on major issues, shielding bad people, being pretentious, and proclaiming himself a "model." Especially after it was discovered last autumn that he was shielding the rightist Chen Rengang and some abnormal phenomena, the Party sharply criticized him many times. After Yang Xiaochun's mistakes were exposed at the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee tried to save him. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee personally talked to him twice, asking him to cherish his history, draw a clear line with Li Shinong, and return to the Party's position. Despite this, they had always maintained a resistant attitude and showed no repentance, which shows that they were determined to stand against the Party and the people to the end.

The meeting unanimously held that Li Shinong, Li Rui, and Yang Xiaochun are class alien elements who have mixed into the Party and cannot be transformed, and incurable degenerated elements, and are rightists within the Party. The meeting unanimously resolved to expel Li Shinong, Yang Xiaochun, and Li Rui from the Party, remove them from all positions within the Party, and recommended that relevant departments remove them from all positions outside the Party.

The meeting unanimously pointed out that thoroughly smashing the anti-Party clique headed by Li Shinong is a major victory in the struggle between two roads within the Anhui Party organization. In order to consolidate the unity of the Party organization throughout the province under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, purify the Party organization, and enhance the Party's combat effectiveness, Party organizations at all levels and all Party members should make earnest efforts in the following aspects:

First, revolutionary vigilance and alertness must be enhanced. Every Party member must firmly stand on the proletarian position, strengthen political responsibility, raise revolutionary vigilance, and wholeheartedly defend our Party and the people's democratic dictatorship to ensure the victory of the socialist cause. All behaviors that endanger the Party, split the Party, and undermine the Party, and all criminal activities that undermine the people's democratic dictatorship must be exposed in a timely manner, and a firm and irreconcilable struggle must be waged against them, opposing the attitudes of sentimentalism, liberalism, and indifference.

Second, the principle of democratic centralism must be strictly observed. Every Party member must correctly exercise democratic rights under centralized guidance, fully develop initiative and creativity, and be brave in criticizing and expressing opinions, daring to argue and adhere to the truth in the Party's political life. At the same time, it is necessary to implement a high degree of centralization on the basis of democracy, abide by the principle of unified leadership of the Party, maintain the Party's unity, and consolidate the Party's discipline. Once the Party organization has made a resolution on any issue, it must be implemented unconditionally, and no one is allowed to disobey it overtly and comply with it covertly, or set up their own system behind their backs. A resolute struggle must be waged against such unorganized and undisciplined behaviors that undermine the principle of democratic centralism. Every Party member must be subjected to the Party's strict supervision from top to bottom and from bottom to top.

Third, a communist worldview must be established. Every Party member must strive to strengthen Party spirit training, constantly improve communist consciousness, and cultivate the noble qualities of selflessness, diligence, and wholehearted service to the people. It is necessary to strengthen criticism and self-criticism, strengthen ideological transformation, resolutely overcome the despicable bourgeois individualism, and oppose competing for fame, position, and treatment, and being overly concerned with personal gains and losses; especially those Party members who come from exploiting class families must strengthen their own transformation to make themselves worthy of the name of Communist Party members.

Fourth, the Central Committee's guidelines and policies must be resolutely implemented. Every Party member must earnestly study the Central Committee's guidelines and policies, and strive to learn them deeply, thoroughly, and completely, constantly improving their policy level to ensure that all of the Party's work is done well. At any time, the Central Committee's guidelines and policies must be faithfully implemented, and no one is allowed to take them out of context or arbitrarily modify them. A resolute struggle must be waged in a timely manner against those behaviors that distort, tamper with, and deviate from the Central Committee's guidelines and policies.

Fifth, the level of Marxism-Leninism must be improved. Every Party member must invigorate their spirit, work hard to study, study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, study dialectical materialism, learn to understand the laws of the development of things, and constantly improve their political and theoretical level and improve their ability to recognize things. Only by correctly mastering the proletarian ideological weapon can we avoid the shortcomings of subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality in our work, and can we forcefully refute revisionist fallacies and all kinds of anti-Marxist-Leninist fallacies, and staunchly defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

We believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on the basis of the victory of this meeting, Party members throughout the province will surely learn a profound lesson from this incident, unite more closely, carry forward revolutionary vigor, unite the broad masses of the people, and strive to promote and complete the great socialist cause.

    中共安徽省委扩大的第六次全体会议
    关于开除右派分子李世农、杨效椿、李锐党籍的决议
    （一九五八年一月二十七日通过）
    中共安徽省委扩大的第六次全体会议，彻底揭露了李世农（省委书记处书记、副省长）、杨效椿（省委委员、省委组织部副部长、省检察长）、李锐（省委委员、省副检察长）、陈仁刚（原省司法厅党组书记、副厅长，已开除党籍，撤销职务）等人的反党集团，粉碎了他们的反党反社会主义的罪恶活动，这是我们党的一个重大胜利。这对于纯洁党的组织，巩固党的团结和统一，巩固人民民主专政，促进社会主义事业的发展，有极为重大的意义。
    这个反党集团的罪行是极为严重的。长期以来，他们阴谋破坏人民民主专政，危害党的组织，反对党的方针、政策。当去年五月资产阶级右派分子向党疯狂进攻的时候，他们的反党活动达到了最高峰。
    根据会议揭发：李世农是这个反党集团的首脑，他伙同他的爪牙，利用职权，宽纵了大批反革命分子、坏分子。为了遂行其宽纵反、坏分子的罪行，他篡改了党的肃反方针和政策，把镇压与宽大相结合的政策，改变成为只要宽大，不要镇压；把有反必肃、有错必纠的方针，改变成为有反不肃、无错也纠。他还经常散布取消肃反斗争、为反革命开脱罪责的谬论，说什么“残余反革命保险一个也找不到”、“反革命分子的坚决性愈来愈弱了”、“反革命分子有两面性”、“反革命分子在我机关多做一年工作，等于多赎一年罪”。他甚至亲手制定一些该判不判、重罪轻判的案例，令各地仿行。据初步统计，经过李世农罪恶指导，全省放掉的反革命分子和其他坏分子达二千余名之多。由于李世农一贯罪恶活动的结果，使不少干部受到了毒害，使政法部门产生了普遍而又严重的右倾倾向。
    1957年初，省委鉴于政法部门右倾思想严重，决定展开批判。当时李世农采取两面手法，在省委会议上不表示意见，背后却指挥他的爪牙陈仁刚、杨效椿、李锐等有计划地到各地“查错反左”，搜集反党材料，并通过检察系统在全省普遍登记党委建议处理的所谓错案，寻找岔子，煽动政法干部反对省委的反右倾决定，向党发动猖狂进攻。他们明目张胆地诬蔑省委提出反右倾之后，下面“搞得很糟”，不许政法部门将省委反右倾指示下达，号召政法干部要“坚持原则，不要怕摘掉乌纱帽”。去年大放大鸣期间，他们的反党气焰更为嚣张。李世农在全省政法会议上，公然攻击省委的反右倾方针，否定反右成绩，他叫嚣：“反右发生了偏差，省委要负主要责任”，讲反右成绩是主要的，这是个“老公式”。公开挑拨政法干部与党委的关系，煽动政法干部与党委对抗，他把各级党委对某些政法干部右倾思想的正确批评，说成是“党委过分责备政法干部”，他诬蔑党委搞错了案件，并要党委向政法干部“承认错误”。他为了遂行其反党活动，还散播了
  “合作化后，已经没有两条道路斗争”，现在经济基础已经改变，今后斗争只是“新旧思想的斗争”，资产阶级走社会主义的道路是“自己阶级的志愿”等等反动谬论，企图以此取消阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政。
    不仅如此，李世农还在许多重大问题上，一贯违抗中央的方针政策，破坏党的统一领导。在土地改革时期，他庇护地主阶级利益；在合作化时期，他坚持资本主义道路；在生产和救灾方面，他反对生产改革和生产自救的正确措施；在建党工作和干部工作方面，他歪曲建党原则，破坏党的纯洁，为反、坏分子大开方便之门；他篡改党的审干原则，宽纵叛徒和自首分子，把这些人的审查结论中的严重政治情节删去，甚至将“对党不忠实”改为“对党忠实”；他一贯包庇坏人坏事，对一些严重违法乱纪分子，百般掩盖，多方照顾。他蓄意破坏党的统一，诽谤省委领导同志，煽动干部反对省委，阴谋篡夺省委领导；他培植个人势力，实行派别性的干部政策，拉拢落后分子，凡对党不满的人，他都同情和支持。
    李世农为着施展他的反党阴谋，还运用了剥削阶级的那套权术，一贯采取两面手法，当面一套，背后一套，打击别人，抬高自己，甚至以“模范党员”自封。他长期隐瞒党对他的处分，吹嘘自己“德有余而才不足”。而且伪装朴素，假冒忠厚，把自己打扮成为一个十足的克己奉公的正人君子。他就是这样来骗取组织、骗取群众信任的。
    杨效椿、李锐是李世农反党集团的两员主将。他们长期相互勾结，相互包庇，相互捧场。除上面已说到的那些事实之外，会议还揭发了杨效椿、李锐的许多罪行。
    杨效椿亲手宽纵了反革命分子和其他坏分子一百余名，错误地释放了大批被劳动教养的人，并且诬蔑1955年的肃反运动是“犯了扩大化的错误”。他包庇右派分子，甚至公然提拔已经暴露的右派分子，扩充其反党势力。
    李锐长期隐瞒恶霸地主的家庭情况，解放后，又极力包庇负有血债的几个恶霸哥哥，并给他们安插工作，他还将不少反、坏分子引进国家机关，甚至对明显的右派分子加以提拔。他常常借口“人民内部问题”、“犯罪未遂”、“后果不严重”等等，拒绝批准逮捕和起诉，为大批反革命分子、坏分子开脱罪责，并亲手宽纵了三十余名罪犯。他一贯抗拒省委决定，把省检察院变成独立王国，并竭力煽动检察干部反对党的领导和监督。他阴谋改变国家检察机关的性质，甚至公然宣称检察机关是保护犯人的。
    会议一致指出：以李世农为首的反党集团的阴谋活动，并不是偶然的，而是有着深刻的历史的社会的根源。李世农、李锐都出身于地主家庭，虽然党对他们进行了长期教育，但他们一直拒绝改造，他们的剥削阶级本质，毫无改变。李世农在土改时曾说：家庭被划为富农
  （实际是地主），土地没收，思想为之一动，李锐在反匪反霸中，曾为恶霸家庭受到清算而痛哭流涕。这就是他们那种剥削阶级思想感情的自然流露。在民主革命时期，李世农、李锐虽然百般伪装，混过了关，但就在那个时候，他们的反动本质，亦有所表现。李世农在抗日战争初期，把党所组织的武装送给了封建势力。在解放战争中，他在淮南工作时，又退却逃跑。李锐也和李世农一样，犯过逃跑主义的错误，他曾在战争紧急关头，放弃自己负责的工作地区。杨效椿系富农家庭出身，入党后，由于没有得到彻底改造，存在着资产阶级的极端个人主义，当个人欲望没有得到满足时，就由对党不满，仇恨党，与党对立，终于蜕化变质，走上反党道路。正是由于他们有的坚持反动立场，有的蜕化变质，所以他们就很自然地勾结起来，组成反党集团。当着社会主义革命深入发展、阶级斗争激化的紧要关头，他们的反党活动就更加露骨，更加嚣张，他们的反动面目也就赤裸裸地暴露出来了。去年春天大鸣大放期间，资产阶级右派不甘心于剥削制度的死亡，向党发动疯狂进攻，反革命分子和地主、富农中的反动分子也乘机进行破坏活动。同时在国际上，由于帝国主义利用匈牙利事件掀起了反共高潮，修正主义思潮一度猖獗，他们竭力攻击无产阶级专政、攻击党的领导、诽谤马列主义。在这样的国际国内情况下，李世农反党集团从他们的剥削阶级立场出发，利用党外右派分子进攻的声势，借助于修正主义的谰言，就向党进行了有组织有计划的更为恶毒的进攻。所以，这一反党集团的形成，以及他们的反党活动在去年五月达到了高峰，是不足为奇的。这是他们坚持剥削阶级立场的必然结果，这是国际国内尖锐的阶级斗争在党内的反映。他们的反党活动是资产阶级右派对党进攻的一个组成部分。历史无情地证明了：他们完全是一伙长期隐藏在党内的阴险的阶级异己分子和蜕化变质分子。
    当李世农、杨效椿、李锐的反党阴谋尚未暴露之前，党曾对他们的错误，特别是对李世农、杨效椿的错误进行过多次教育的。对李世农在抗日战争时期所犯的肃反扩大化的错误和在解放战争中所犯的逃跑主义的错误，党就给予过批评和处分。在解放以后，对他在重大问题上态度暧昧，包庇坏人，矫揉造作，自封“模范”等错误，又一再进行了批评。特别当去年秋季发现他包庇右派分子陈仁刚和一些不正常现象以后，党又多次对他进行过尖锐的批判。对杨效椿的错误，在大会揭露以后，省委还力图挽救他，省委负责同志曾亲自和他两次谈话，要他爱惜自己的历史，和李世农划清界线，回到党的立场上来。尽管如此，但是他们一直抱着抗拒态度，毫无悔改之意，这就说明他们决心和党和人民对立到底。
    会议一致认为：李世农、李锐和杨效椿是混入党内不堪改造的阶级异己分子和不可救药的蜕化变质分子，是党内的右派。大会一致决议：开除李世农、杨效椿、李锐的党籍，撤销他们党内的一切职务，并建议有关方面撤销他们党外的一切职务。
    会议一致指出：彻底粉碎以李世农为首的反党集团，是安徽党组织内两条道路斗争的重大胜利。为了巩固全省党组织在党中央领导下的团结和统一，纯洁党的组织，增强党的战斗力，各级党组织和全体党员应当从下列几个方面切实努力：
    第一、革命嗅觉和警惕性必须提高。每个党员一定要坚决站稳无产阶级立场，加强政治责任心，提高革命警惕性，全心全力保卫我们的党，全心全力保卫人民民主专政，以保障社会主义事业的胜利。对于一切危害党、分裂党、破坏党的行为，对于一切破坏人民民主专政的罪恶活动，必须及时揭露，坚决进行不调和的斗争，反对温情主义、自由主义和麻木不仁的态度。
    第二、民主集中制的原则必须严格遵守。每个党员一定要在集中指导下正确运用民主权利，充分发扬积极性、创造性，在党的政治生活中勇于批评和发表意见，敢于争辩和坚持真理。同时必须在民主基础上实行高度集中，遵守党的统一领导原则、维护党的团结，巩固党的纪律。任何问题，一经党的组织作出决议，必须无条件执行，决不允许阳奉阴违，背后自搞一套。对于那种破坏民主集中制原则的无组织无纪律行为，必须进行坚决斗争。任何党员，都必须受到党的由上而下和由下而上的严格监督。
    第三、共产主义人生观必须确立。每个党员一定要努力加强党性锻炼，不断提高共产主义觉悟，培养大公无私，勤勤恳恳，全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质。必须加强批评和自我批评，加强思想改造，坚决克服卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义，反对争名誉、争地位、争待遇、斤斤计较个人得失；特别是那些出身于剥削阶级家庭的党员，更必须加强对自己的改造，使自己成为一个名副其实的共产党员。
    第四、中央的方针政策必须坚决执行。每个党员一定要认真研究中央的方针政策，做到学深、学透、学全，不断提高自己的政策水平，保证做好党的一切工作。任何时候，对于中央的方针政策，必须忠实执行，决不容许断章取义，决不容许擅自修改。对于那些歪曲、篡改和背离中央方针政策的行为，必须及时进行坚决的斗争。
    第五、马列主义水平必须提高。每个党员一定要振作精神，下苦功学习，学习马列主义，学习毛主席著作，学习唯物辩证法，学会认识事物发展的规律，不断提高政治理论水平，提高识别能力。只有正确地掌握无产阶级的思想武器，才能在工作中避免主观性、片面性和表面性的毛病，才能有力驳斥修正主义谰调和各式各样反马列主义的谬论，坚强地保卫马列主义原则。
    我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在这次会议胜利的基础上，全省党员一定能够接受这一事件的深刻教训，更紧密地团结起来，发扬革命朝气，团结广大人民，为促进和完成伟大的社会主义事业而努力奋斗。
