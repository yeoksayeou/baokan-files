Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st: An official Indonesian Army press release today stated that a remnant of rebel forces, numbering 300, fleeing from Medan to Balige in southern North Sumatra, has been surrounded on the shores of Lake Toba in North Sumatra.

The press release stated that the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the government forces had recovered Seribudolok on the northeast corner of Lake Toba. Vessels traveling from Tigaras, where the rebel faction is besieged, to Samosir Island in the center of Lake Toba have been sunk, leaving the rebel faction with no means of escape.

The press release also stated that government forces are pursuing another rebel faction that fled north from Medan towards Aceh, and recovered an area near Besitang, northwest of Medan, on the morning of the 20th. Government forces are pursuing and eliminating the rebels towards Besitang. The press release pointed out that, so far, 300 rebel soldiers, including artillery and infantry, in this area have surrendered to the government forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 21st: Jakarta newspapers today revealed numerous facts concerning the active assistance that the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are providing to Indonesian rebel groups through the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

"Dongxing Bao" reported that, according to official sources in Medan, weapons seized by Indonesian government forces from rebels in Pekanbaru were U.S.-made weapons smuggled from Taipei to the area. The newspaper stated that the rebel Panto Woo had requested assistance from Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei, and the former commander of the Indonesian Seventh Military Region, Sumual, also discussed the issue of assisting the rebels with Dulles in Taipei.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" stated that documents found by government troops and police in Pekanbaru and other areas prove that members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Indonesia have become an important "bridge" between the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Hussein rebel group. Most of the weapons supplied by the United States to the Hussein rebel group were smuggled to the rebels through Taiwan.

The newspaper revealed that recently many Kuomintang generals from Chiang Kai-shek's forces have secretly entered Indonesia as "teachers." The Indonesian government has taken measures to deal with them, but they are intensifying their covert activities. In addition, members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are also engaged in rice speculation to disrupt the Indonesian economy. "People's Daily" believes that the Indonesian government should take more resolute measures to deal with these members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚政府军追歼残敌
    叛军一股被围困在多巴湖畔
    美国利用蒋帮援助叛乱集团
    据新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处今天发表公报说，从棉兰向北苏门答腊南部打板奴里逃窜的一股叛军残余部队共三百人已经被围困在北苏门答腊的多巴湖畔。
    公报说，政府军第二步兵团已经收复了多巴湖东北角上的瑟里布多洛，从这股叛军被围地点提加腊斯通往多巴湖中心的散摩西尔岛的船只也已经被凿沉，因此这股叛军已经陷入无路可逃的境地。
    公报还说，同时，政府军正在追击从棉兰往北逃往亚齐的另一股叛军，并且在20日早上收复了棉兰西北的美施登附近的一个地方。政府军正在向美施登追歼叛军。公报指出，到现在为止，在这个地区已经有三百名包括炮兵和步兵的叛军士兵向政府军投降。
    新华社雅加达21日电　雅加达报纸今天揭露了有关美国和东南亚条约组织正在通过蒋介石集团去积极帮助印度尼西亚叛乱集团的大量事实。
    “东星报”说，据棉兰官方消息，印度尼西亚政府军队在北干巴鲁从叛军手中缴获的武器是从台北偷运到这个地区的美国制造的武器。这家报纸说，叛乱分子潘托伍在台北曾经要求蒋介石给予援助，而叛变的前印度尼西亚第七军区司令苏穆阿尔在台北也同杜勒斯讨论了关于援助叛乱分子的问题。
    雅加达“人民日报”说，政府军队和警察在北干巴鲁和其他地区搜出来的文件证明，在印度尼西亚的蒋介石集团分子已经成为东南亚条约组织和侯赛尼叛乱集团之间的一座重要的“桥梁”。美国供给侯赛尼叛乱集团的大部分武器是通过台湾偷运给叛乱分子的。
    这家报纸揭露，最近有许多蒋介石国民党的将领们以“教师”身份偷偷地进入印度尼西亚。印度尼西亚政府已经采取了对付他们的措施，但是他们日益变本加厉地暗中进行活动。此外，蒋介石集团分子还从事大米投机买卖以扰乱印度尼西亚的经济。“人民日报”认为印度尼西亚政府应该采取更坚决的措施来对付这些蒋介石集团分子。（附图片）
