    No Persecution of Rouzbeh!
    By a commentator of this newspaper
    According to Western news agencies, Iranian patriot Khosrow Rouzbeh has recently been sentenced to death by an Iranian military court. All honest people are shocked by this news, and they cannot help but express deep concern for Rouzbeh's suffering.
    Rouzbeh is an outstanding son of the Iranian people. For many years, he has consistently fought for Iran's national independence, peace, and democracy. His entire life has been dedicated to the Iranian people, and he has made many contributions. However, the Iranian authorities have repeatedly persecuted Rouzbeh, arresting him and imprisoning him several times. Now, the Iranian authorities are using a military court to sentence Rouzbeh to death on trumped-up charges.
    In recent years, due to imperialist oppression and aggression, Iran's independent sovereignty has been severely damaged, Iran's resources have been plundered on a large scale, Iran's national crisis has deepened, and the vast number of people are in dire straits. This situation is, of course, intolerable to every patriotic Iranian. In order to get rid of imperialist enslavement, to enable their motherland to embark on a path that conforms to national interests, and to fight for the rights of the vast number of people, they have been waging a heroic struggle. Rouzbeh is one of these countless patriots who care about the fate of their country, and he is an outstanding fighter among them, deeply loved by the Iranian people. However, under the instigation and support of imperialism, Iran's patriotic and democratic forces have been brutally persecuted, countless patriots have lost their lives, and more people are living a life of darkness in prison. Now, the dark forces in Iran have reached out to Rouzbeh. This perverse act will obviously only benefit the colonial aggression policy of imperialism, will only make Iran's national disaster even deeper, and cannot but be met with greater resistance from the Iranian people.
    The Iranian authorities' persecution of Rouzbeh has aroused strong condemnation from public opinion in various countries. The Iranian people are also working to save Rouzbeh's life. We, the Chinese people, morally sympathize with and support this effort by the Iranian people. We sincerely hope that this effort will be successful and achieve the goal of restoring the freedom of Rouzbeh and other victimized patriotic people.

    不许迫害鲁兹贝赫！
    本报评论员
    据西方通讯社报道，伊朗爱国者霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫，最近已被伊朗军事法庭判处死刑。一切正直的人们都被这个消息所震动，他们不能不对鲁兹贝赫的受难表示深切关怀。
    鲁兹贝赫是伊朗人民的优秀儿子。多年以来，他始终不懈地为伊朗的民族独立、和平与民主而奋斗。他的全部生活都是忠于伊朗人民的，并且做了许多贡献。但是，伊朗当局竟一再地对鲁兹贝赫进行迫害，几次逮捕他入狱。现在，伊朗当局竟利用军事法庭，以莫须有的罪名，判处鲁兹贝赫死刑。
    几年以来，由于帝国主义的压迫和侵略，伊朗的独立主权受到了严重损害，伊朗的资源遭到大规模掠夺，伊朗的民族危机日益深重，广大人民处于水深火热中。这种处境当然是每一个爱国的伊朗人所不能忍受的。他们为了摆脱帝国主义的奴役，为了使自己的祖国能够走上符合民族利益的道路，为了争取广大人民的生活权利，一直在进行着英勇的斗争。鲁兹贝赫就是这些关怀祖国命运的无数爱国者当中的一个，而且是他们当中的卓越战士，深受伊朗人民热爱。然而，在帝国主义的指使和支持下，伊朗的爱国民主力量一直受到残酷的迫害，无数的爱国者丧失了生命，更多的人则在牢狱中过着暗无天日的生活。现在，伊朗黑暗势力又向鲁兹贝赫伸出了黑手。这种倒行逆施显然只会对帝国主义的殖民侵略政策有利，只会使伊朗的民族灾难更加深重，而不能不遭到伊朗人民的更大反抗。
    伊朗当局迫害鲁兹贝赫的行为，已经激起各国舆论的强烈谴责。伊朗人民也正在为着营救鲁兹贝赫的生命而进行努力。我们中国人民在道义上完全同情和支持伊朗人民的这种努力。我们深愿这种努力获得成功，达到恢复鲁兹贝赫和其他受害的爱国人民的自由的目的。
