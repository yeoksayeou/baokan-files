    Written in the Songs of Triumph
    Wei Wei
    The Volunteer Army has returned. Let us wash away the battle dust for you, comrades. From the autumn of 1950 when the flames of war were urgent, it has been seven years now. In these seven years, you have been missing your motherland day and night; even in the trenches, when charging into battle against the enemy, just mentioning her name filled you with the strength to fight fearlessly. Comrades, take a good look at the long-missed motherland, today you have returned to her side.
    You have returned. You went away bravely amidst the raging fire of the Korean battlefield, and today the clouds have cleared, and you return home in songs of triumph. Comrades, you are draped in the dust of travel, but also in immortal glory. It is you who used your heroic arms to repel the enemy, allowing our young motherland to withstand a severe test; it is you who allowed the homeless Korean elderly and orphans to once again live peaceful lives. Comrades, countless new factories and countless mirror-like reservoirs in our country all have your contribution; in Korea, the crops and flowers that have grown anew on the filled-in bomb craters are all filled with gratitude towards you.
    You have returned. You have walked such arduous journeys! The people of the motherland will never forget the days you mixed fried noodles with snow water, the days you wrestled with the enemy with stones, the days when, amidst the whistling of tons of bombs, you shouted slogans and beat the enemy until they were bloody and battered. Comrades! All of this will be recorded in history and will forever inspire our descendants. The spirit of you will surge in the veins of our nation for generations to come!
    You have returned. Let us forever remember the comrades who sleep there. Without their generous dedication, there would be none of this today. They can no longer return to their hometowns, but their spirit has built a towering monument of internationalism. This tower shines brightly, illuminating the path of the great unity of the people of the world, this tower is enough to make the Chinese people proudly stand in the world, stand in the East!
    You have returned. Let us also forever remember the Korean people who fought alongside us. In the seven years you were away from your motherland, I know that you were always thinking of everything in the motherland, but when you had to leave the people there, you were so reluctant. Before leaving, you collected a handful of Korean soil and sowed seeds of Masson's pine all over the mountains. What deep affection you have for the Korean elders who loved and supported you! Comrades! Seriously learn the good qualities of the Korean people, and forever cherish the friendship between our two peoples, only the friendship of the people is our most reliable Great Wall!
    You have returned. Comrades! You are not tired soldiers arriving at a campsite, you are energetic warriors moving from one battlefield to another. The battlefield of creating a new life, the battlefield of great production and construction. Before you, you will soon see the moving scenes of this great battlefield, this scene will soon awaken your desire to create new honors. Comrades, throw yourselves into this new battlefield, with your heroic spirit, you will surely be able to overcome new difficulties and create new merits!
    Comrades! You have returned. Our motherland's excellent sons and daughters, the most beloved people of the whole nation; you have returned. The whole nation welcomes you, your old and new comrades also welcome you. What people use to welcome you is not only flowers and cheers, but also thousands of new factories, new buildings, new streets, new districts, as well as the prosperous collective farms that are like stars dotted across the motherland and their crisscrossing canals. This is the triumphal arch that the people of the motherland have woven for you with their own hands!

    写在凯歌声里
    魏巍
    志愿军回来了。让我们来给你洗一洗战尘吧，同志们。从1950年烽烟告急的秋季，到现在已经七年了。在这七年里，你们朝朝夕夕都在怀念着自己的祖国；就是在战壕里，在向敌人冲锋陷阵的时候，只要提起她的名字，你们就涌起了奋不顾身的力量。同志们，好好看看久违的祖国吧，今天，你们已经回到了她的身边。
    你们回来了。你们是迎着朝鲜战场上的漫天大火，慷慨而去，今天是云散烟消，凯歌还乡。同志们，你们披着风尘，也披着不朽的光荣。是你们，用英雄的臂膀击退了敌人，使我们年轻的祖国，经受了严酷的考验；是你们，使无家可归的朝鲜老人和孤儿，又重度和平的生活。同志们，我们国家里无数新起的工厂，无数明镜般的水库，都有你们的功劳一份；在朝鲜，在填平的弹坑上，新长起的庄稼和花草，都充满对你们的感激。
    你们回来了。你们走过了多末艰苦的路程！祖国人民将永远不会忘记，你们用雪水拌炒面的日子，用石头跟敌人厮拼的日子，在成吨的炸弹嘶啸中，你们高喊着口号，把敌人打得头破血流的日子。同志们！这一切都将载入史册，永远激励我们的后代。我们民族的血管里，将百代不衰地奔腾着你们的精神！
    你们回来了。让我们永远记住长眠在那里的战友吧。没有他们的慷慨献身，就不会有今天的一切。他们已经不能再回到自己的故乡了，但他们的精神，却筑成了一座国际主义的高塔。这座高塔光芒四射地照亮了世界人民大团结的道路，这座高塔足使中国人民自豪地矗立在世界，矗立在东方！
    你们回来了。让我们也永远记住并肩作战的朝鲜人民吧。在你们离开祖国的七年中，我知道你们时时都在系念着祖国的一切，可是当你们要离开那里的人民，你们又是那末依恋。临走你们又收起了一把朝鲜的土，又撒种上满山的马尾松。你们对爱护你们，支援你们的朝鲜父老是怀着何等的深情呵！同志们！认真学习朝鲜人民的好品质，也永远珍视我们两国人民的友谊吧，只有人民的友谊，才是我们最可靠的长城！
    你们回来了。同志们！你们不是疲劳的兵士走到了宿营地，你们是精力充沛的战士，从一个战场开到了另一个战场。创造新生活的战场，生产大建设的战场。在你们的面前，你们马上可以看到这个大战场动人的场景，这种场景，很快就会唤起你们创立新荣誉的渴望。同志们，投到这个新的战场上来吧，凭你们的英雄气概，你们一定可以克服新的困难，创立新的功勋！
    同志们！你们回来了。我们祖国优秀的儿女，全国人民最可爱的人；你们回来了。全国人民都在欢迎你，你的新老战友也在欢迎你。人们用来欢迎你的，不止是鲜花与欢呼，还有千百座新的工厂，新的楼房，新的街道，新的市区，以及繁星一样布满祖国的兴旺的集体农庄和他们纵横交织的水渠。这就是祖国人民用双手给你们编织起来的凯旋门！
      一九五八年三月十六日
