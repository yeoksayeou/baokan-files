Don't Be a Slave to Rules and Regulations
应麟

Recently, in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign in central government agencies, many unreasonable rules and regulations have been exposed. These rules and regulations, to varying degrees, affect the development of productive forces and should be reformed. According to the exposures made by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign alone, this ministry needs to revise or abolish more than 200 rules and regulations. Other units probably have no fewer. Among these rules and regulations that need to be revised or abolished, many were reasonable at the time and played a role in promoting production and work, but after the situation changed, they became unreasonable or not very reasonable. There are also some rules and regulations that were originally products of subjectivism and bureaucracy. They were not formulated based on actual needs, but were conceived by a few people, or based on some one-sided situations. Therefore, such rules and regulations are not only unsuitable for current needs, but were also unreasonable at the time, and even pointless.

Since the unreasonableness of many rules and regulations is so obvious, why not revise or abolish them in a timely manner? In the final analysis, it is because many leaders lack the spirit of innovation and have right-leaning conservative ideas. Specifically, there are two different situations: one is being content with the status quo and not seeking to improve. Although they clearly know that some rules and regulations are unreasonable or not very reasonable, and the opinions of the masses have been piled up in front of them, they believe that their work has been done very well, or that although the work is not very good, it is still passable. Therefore, they are unwilling to revise, let alone bravely abandon the old and create a new one. When objective circumstances force them to change, they only treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, unwilling to solve the problem from the root. Another situation is that some people regard rules and regulations as "laws" that cannot be modified under any circumstances. To modify or abolish them is to "break the law." In Shanghai, a bricklayer suggested that the quota for the amount of bricks used per cubic meter of brick wall was too high and could be reduced from 775 bricks to 745 bricks. This suggestion could have been considered (later tests proved that this had no impact on the quality of the project), but the production technology team at the construction site used the shields of "national quota, no right to modify" and "arbitrary modification is a violation of the law." Yes, rules and regulations are a kind of "law," which cannot be arbitrarily modified or not implemented, otherwise it will create a state of anarchy in production and work. But why can't we think about it when implementing rules and regulations, and see whether this or that rule and regulation is beneficial or harmful to production and work? If some rules and regulations have been proven to be not only unhelpful but also harmful to production and work, why can't they be modified or re-formulated based on the actual situation and the opinions of the masses? It seems that many people have not yet solved the question of whether rules and regulations serve production and work, or whether production and work serve rules and regulations.

    不作规章制度的奴隶
    应麟
    最近，中央国家机关在反浪费反保守运动中，揭发了很多不合理的规章制度，这些规章制度程度不等地影响着生产力的发展，应该进行改革。仅据冶金工业部在反浪费反保守运动中的揭发，这个部需要修改或废除的规章制度就有二百多种，其他单位可能也不少于此数。在这些需要修改或废除的规章制度中，有许多在当时还是合理的，对生产和工作起过促进作用，在情况发生变化以后，就成为不合理或不甚合理的了。还有一些规章制度，原本就是主观主义和官僚主义的产物，不是根据实际的需要拟订的，而是少数人想出来的，或者根据一些片面的情况订出来的。因此，这样的规章制度，不仅不适合现时的需要，而且就在当时也是不合理的，甚至是毫无意义的画蛇添足。
    许多规章制度的不合理既然很明显，为什么不及时地加以修改或废除呢？归根到底，还是由于许多领导人缺乏革新精神，存在着右倾保守思想，具体分析起来，有这样两种不同的情况：一种是安于现状，不求上进。虽然明明知道一些规章制度不合理或不甚合理，群众的意见已经成堆成堆地送到他们的面前，而他们认为自己的工作已经做得很好，或者工作虽然不很好，但也还过得去，因此，他们就不愿意修改，更不愿意勇敢地抛弃旧的，再订一个新的。在客观情况逼得非改不可的时候，他们也只是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，不愿从根本上来解决问题。另一种情况是，有些人把规章制度看作是绝对不能修改的“法规”。如要修改或废除，就是“犯法”。上海市有个泥工，提出每立方公尺砖墙的用砖量的定额太高，可以由七百七十五块减到七百四十五块。这个意见本来是可以考虑的（以后试验证明，这样作对工程质量并无影响），但是工地的生产技术组，却搬出了“国家定额，无权修改”和“随便修改，就是犯法”的挡箭牌。是的，规章制度是一种“法规”，是不能随便修改，也不能随便不执行的，否则就会造成生产和工作上的无政府状态，但是为什么在执行规章制度的时候，不可以想一想，不可以看一看这个或那个规章制度是对生产和工作有利还是无利呢？如果有些规章制度，确已证明对生产和工作不仅无利而且有害，为什么不可以根据实际情况和群众的意见加以修改或重订呢？看来，是规章制度为生产和工作服务，还是生产和工作为规章制度服务，这个问题许多人还没有很好地解决。
