    Ode to Macheng
    Hong Yang
    Macheng is a great poet, wielding a mighty pen, filling the fields and villages with magnificent verses. "Thousands upon thousands, double it again, [Note 1] complete the ten-year plan in one year!" These breathtaking words hang on the long ridges of the fields. The round piles of accumulated fertilizer also contain winding lines of poetry: "Repair the reservoirs like storing grain, [Note 2] accumulate fertilizer like storing food!" Macheng is a great poet, writing poetry on the earth, depicting the wheat seedlings as fat and strong, outlining the paddy fields, pond after pond. The verses roll in the soil, urging the crops to grow quickly! The verses seethe in people's hearts, calling for leap after leap forward!
    [Note 1] Thousands upon thousands – meaning an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu for cotton and wheat, and 1,000 jin per mu for rice. 10,000 pigs raised per township. 10,000 jin of grain income per household.
    [Note 2] "Reservoirs" refers to water reservoirs.

    麻城颂
    洪洋麻城是个大诗人，正挥动千钧大笔，阡陌间，村舍里，落满了洋洋的诗句。“千千万万，翻一番，〔注一〕十年规划一年完！”惊心动魄的豪语，挂在长长的田埂上。滚圆的积肥堆里，也有宛曲的诗行：“修库如修仓，〔注二〕积肥如积粮！”麻城是个大诗人，诗笔挥在大地上；写出了麦苗肥又壮，勾出了水田一汪汪。诗句在泥土里滚动，催促着庄稼快生长！诗句在人心上沸扬，呼唤着跃进再跃进！
    〔注一〕千千万万——即平均亩产棉麦千斤、稻谷千斤。每乡养猪万头。每户收入粮食万斤。
    〔注二〕“库”指水库。
