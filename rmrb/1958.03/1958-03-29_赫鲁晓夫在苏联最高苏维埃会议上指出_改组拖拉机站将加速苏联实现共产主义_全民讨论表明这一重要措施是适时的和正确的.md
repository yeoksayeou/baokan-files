Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th (TASS): At the joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the evening of March 27th, Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, pointed out in his report that the very significant issue of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations has been discussed by the people nationwide and has aroused their enthusiastic response.

Khrushchev pointed out that in the first twenty-five days of March, a total of 576,879 meetings were held nationwide, with 49.9 million people participating, and more than 3 million people put forward opinions and suggestions at the meetings. During this period, Soviet newspapers and radio stations received a total of about 126,000 articles and letters proposing suggestions for reorganizing machine tractor stations, of which about 100,300 were published.

Khrushchev then said that the nationwide discussion shows that the measures formulated by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU for further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations are timely, fully mature, and correct. Everyone has put forward many extremely valuable opinions, criticized the serious shortcomings in the practice of providing technical services to collective farm production and the work of agricultural organs, and put forward specific suggestions and supplements. Khrushchev pointed out that the speeches of millions of Soviet people are permeated with concern for the further strengthening and prosperity of the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev emphasized that the nationwide discussion shows that the measures formulated by the CPSU for further developing the collective farm system, like the recently implemented reform of industrial management, have not only great practical economic significance for the victorious solution of the task of the Soviet Union's gradual transition from socialism to communism, but also great theoretical and truly programmatic significance.

Khrushchev said that participants in the nationwide discussion rightly believe that the measures for further developing the collective farm system are an integral part of the great communist construction plan.

Khrushchev pointed out that at the current stage of Soviet development, in terms of economic construction, following the reform of industrial management, the extremely important and urgent national economic task of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations has been given top priority. The practice of collective farm construction and the need to open up broader prospects for the development of agricultural productive forces and to provide the Soviet Union with abundant agricultural products urgently raised this task. The reform of industrial management deserves to be called an important revolutionary measure, and the reorganization of machine tractor stations is equally a revolutionary measure in agriculture.

When talking about the summary of Soviet agricultural development, Khrushchev pointed out that fundamental changes have taken place in the technical equipment of Soviet agriculture. In the past four years, the state's investment in agriculture has been 10 billion rubles more than the total agricultural investment in the second, third, fourth, and three years of the fifth five-year plans (calculated at comparable prices).

Khrushchev cited figures to illustrate the great leap forward in Soviet agriculture.

In his report, Khrushchev pointed out the significant role of machine tractor stations in establishing and consolidating the collective farm system. He then pointed out that now it is possible for the state and collective farms to no longer need the intermediate link of machine tractor stations, which means that we are now at a new stage in the development of the collective farm system.

Now that collective farms have been able to invest heavily in production, purchase complex technical equipment, and ensure the correct use of this equipment, the question of fundamentally changing the form of technical services for collective farm production has matured. Khrushchev said that machine tractor stations have completed their historical mission and need to be fundamentally reorganized.

Khrushchev said that the Party believes that one of the primary tasks at present is how to ensure that the production of agricultural products can be greatly increased with the least amount of labor. The struggle to increase labor productivity is a fundamental issue in domestic policy. The current situation of machine tractor stations providing technical services to collective farms is lagging behind the above requirements. At the same time, the situation of having two masters on one piece of land prevents technical equipment and land from being well utilized. Khrushchev pointed out that the nationwide discussion clearly shows that at present, there are hundreds of thousands of farms that are capable of purchasing the necessary technical equipment with cash and using them more effectively.

The reporter said that the transition from machine tractor stations providing technical services to collective farms to freely selling tractors and other machines to collective farms is to raise the leadership of agriculture to a higher level. With the reorganization of machine tractor stations, the economic ties between collective farms and socialist industry will continue to expand, and the city's help to the countryside in production will increase day by day, and the methods will become more and more numerous. Collective farms have the opportunity to order more perfect new technical equipment that is suitable for the special economic needs of various regions of the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev emphatically pointed out that since the victory of Lenin's collectivization policy, this reorganization of machine tractor stations is the most significant and meaningful event in the construction of socialist agriculture. Now, under the conditions that socialist production relations occupy a dominant position and the working class headed by the Communist Party plays a leading role, the land and machines belonging to the state but permanently assigned to the collective farms are concentrated in the hands of one master.

In his report, Khrushchev talked about some theoretical issues related to the task of reorganizing machine tractor stations.

He pointed out that some people believe that selling tractors and other agricultural machinery to collective farms seems to strengthen collective farm ownership and weaken state ownership, the highest form of ownership, which is essentially incorrect. He then said that there are certain differences between collective farm cooperative ownership and ownership by the whole people, but these are only different forms of development of the same socialist mode of production. Khrushchev emphasized that the measures currently formulated to further develop the collective farm system and reorganize machine tractor stations can ensure the expansion of collective farm ownership and bring it closer to ownership by the whole people.

Khrushchev said that the development process of the collective farm economy is such that the public accumulation funds are constantly growing, and their essence has also changed, and its structure and social nature are increasingly close to the national production fund.

He then said that every collective farmer now understands that the more public accumulation funds, the more machines the collective farm can purchase, the more the level of production mechanization will be improved, the nature of the labor of collective farmers will be close to that of workers, and more products can be produced, and the income of collective farms and members will continue to increase.

Khrushchev pointed out that it is necessary to revise the previously formulated regulations on the distribution of income and the proportion of public accumulation funds in collective farms according to workdays. He said that it seems that the proportion of public accumulation funds should be increased at present. Khrushchev also pointed out that the increase in the proportion of public accumulation funds cannot be achieved by reducing the total amount of income distributed according to workdays. He explained that the source of the increase in the proportion of public accumulation funds should be the increase in total income and the increase in income per hectare of land and various products.

When talking about adjusting the issue of requisition and purchase prices, Khrushchev pointed out that these prices should be adjusted now to stimulate the development of production, ensure legitimate income, and at the same time enable all collective farms to allocate the necessary amount of funds to purchase highly productive technical equipment. Khrushchev said that in determining the prices of agricultural products, we should proceed from the interests of correctly developing industry and agriculture in proportion and ensure the leading role of heavy industry.

Khrushchev pointed out that after the technical equipment is transferred from the machine tractor stations to the collective farms, the machines can be used more rationally and labor productivity can be improved.

Khrushchev pointed out that some people believe that the reorganization of machine tractor stations will weaken the state's leadership over collective farms, which is completely unfounded. The state still holds all the economic levers for managing the economy.

When talking about the method of selling technical equipment to collective farms, Khrushchev pointed out that preliminary calculations show that most collective farms can immediately purchase the technical equipment of machine tractor stations. Some areas can temporarily retain some machine tractor stations to perform their current functions. However, even in places where machine tractor stations are retained, individual collective farms can also purchase technical equipment. In areas where collective farms are economically weak, the reorganization of machine tractor stations may take two or three years, and in some places even longer. The payment period for technical equipment should probably vary according to the economic conditions of each collective farm and region. Collective farms with highly developed public economy and high cash income will pay the price of the machines to the state within one or two years, medium-sized collective farms within two or three years, and economically backward collective farms can be given a five-year period. New tractors and agricultural machinery sold to collective farms should generally be paid in cash, or loaned to them depending on the economic conditions of the collective farms.

Khrushchev pointed out that collective farms are now able to pay off the cost of purchasing technical equipment within the prescribed period. In 1956, the funds allocated by collective farms for public accumulation funds were 16.7 billion rubles, while the value of the technical equipment that collective farms will purchase from machine tractor stations is about 20 billion rubles. It can be seen that the funds allocated for public accumulation funds in one year can almost offset the value of the technical equipment. According to calculations by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, in 1958, the proportion of public accumulation funds will be approximately equal to 25 billion rubles, and will continue to grow year by year in the future.

Khrushchev said that state-owned enterprises with completely new functions are planned to be established to replace the current machine tractor stations, and these enterprises will be called technical repair stations. Khrushchev said that technical repair stations are not in a position to lead collective farms. They will become economically accounting enterprises and will do their utmost to help collective farms make good use of and manage tractors and perform the functions of national technical supervision.

In view of the increase in the collective farms' own working capital, Khrushchev suggested expanding bank credit for production needed by the collective farms.

Khrushchev pointed out in his report that technical equipment and other commodities needed by collective farms can only be sold on a voluntary basis. He said that it seems that the method of free sale of machines should also be extended to state farms.

After the reorganization of machine tractor stations, under the new system, technical equipment will be used more rationally, labor productivity will be improved, and the production of products will be increased. This will lead to lower costs for agricultural products. As a result, the state has a realistic possibility of lowering the purchase prices of agricultural products, which will make it possible to lower the retail prices of food and industrial products, thereby ensuring the further improvement of the people's material welfare.

Khrushchev pointed out that the time is not far away when we will have a considerable abundance of agricultural products. At that time, the conditions for purchasing products will change. The state will be able to purchase grain, meat, and other products in areas where they are cheaper. Khrushchev said that it should not be thought that all of this is a matter of the distant future. The issues discussed here have practical significance at present.

Khrushchev finally said that the Central Committee of the Party believes that the implementation of the proposed measures to further develop the collective farm system and reorganize machine tractor stations will help to successfully implement the historic resolution of the 20th National Congress of the Party and promote our country's movement towards communism.

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上指出
    改组拖拉机站将加速苏联实现共产主义
    全民讨论表明这一重要措施是适时的和正确的
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫27日晚间在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上作报告时指出，关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站这个具有非常重大意义的问题，已经由全国人民进行了讨论，并且引起了他们的热烈反应。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在3月份的头二十五天中，全国一共举行了五十七万六千八百七十九次会议，参加会议的有四千九百九十万人，有三百多万人在会上提出了意见和建议。在这段时间里，苏联报刊和电台一共收到了约十二万六千件文章和信件，提出关于改组机器拖拉机站的建议，其中发表的约有十万零三千件。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，全民讨论表明，苏共中央全会所拟定的进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施是适时的、完全成熟的和正确的。大家提出了很多极宝贵的意见，批评了对集体农庄的生产技术服务实践和农业机关工作中的严重缺点，提出了具体的建议和补充。赫鲁晓夫指出，千百万苏联人的发言都渗透着对苏联进一步壮大和繁荣的关心。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，全民讨论表明，苏共所拟定的进一步发展集体农庄制度的措施同不久前实现的工业管理改组一样，对于胜利地解决苏联从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的任务不仅具有重大的、实际的经济意义，而且具有巨大的理论意义和真正纲领性的意义。
    赫鲁晓夫说，全民讨论的参加者正确地认为进一步发展集体农庄制度的措施是伟大的共产主义建设计划的不可分割的组成部分。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在苏联发展的现阶段，在经济建设方面，紧接着工业管理改组之后，进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站这个极其重大和刻不容缓的国民经济任务就被提到了首要地位。集体农庄建设的实践以及要给农业生产力的发展开辟更加广阔的天地、给苏联生产丰足的农产品的必要性，迫切地提出了这个任务。工业管理的改组不愧为一个重要的革命措施，而机器拖拉机站的改组在农业方面也同样是一个革命措施。
    在谈到苏联农业发展的总结时，赫鲁晓夫指出，在苏联农业的技术装备上发生了根本的变化。最近四年中，国家在农业方面的投资比第二个、第三个、第四个五年计划和第五个五年计划中的三年的农业投资总和（按比较价格计算）还多一百亿卢布。
    赫鲁晓夫援引数字说明苏联农业有了很大的跃进。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出了机器拖拉机站在建立和巩固集体农庄制度方面的重大作用。他接着指出，现在，国家和集体农庄之间已经有可能不需要机器拖拉机站这个中间环节了，这意味着我们现在处在集体农庄制度发展的新阶段。
    现在，既然集体农庄已经能够对生产进行大量投资，购置复杂的技术设备，保证正确地使用这些设备，那未根本改变对集体农庄的生产技术服务形式的问题也就成熟了。赫鲁晓夫说，机器拖拉机站已经完成了它们的历史使命，需要进行根本改组。
    赫鲁晓夫说，党认为，目前的首要任务之一是如何保证花费最少的劳动而又能大大增加农产品的生产。提高劳动生产率的斗争是国内政策中的根本问题。机器拖拉机站对集体农庄进行技术服务的情况现在落后于上述要求。同时，一块土地上有两个主人这种情况使技术设备和土地得不到很好的利用。赫鲁晓夫指出，全民讨论明显地表明，目前有成千上万的农庄有能力用现款购买必要的技术设备和更有效地利用它们。
    报告人说，从机器拖拉机站对集体农庄进行生产技术服务过渡到向集体农庄自由出卖拖拉机和其他机器，这就是把对农业的领导提到更高的水平。随着机器拖拉机站的改组，集体农庄同社会主义工业的经济联系将不断扩大，城市在生产上给农村的帮助将日益增长，方式也会越来越多。集体农庄有可能定购适合苏联各地区经济特殊需要的更完善的新技术设备。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出，自从列宁的合作化政策胜利之后，这次机器拖拉机站改组是社会主义农业建设方面最重大和最有意义的事件。现在，在社会主义生产关系占统治地位、以共产党为首的工人阶级起领导作用的条件下，属于国家的、但永远交给集体农庄使用的土地和机器都集中到一个主人的手里。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中谈到同改组机器拖拉机站的任务有关的一些理论问题。
    他指出，有人认为把拖拉机和其他农业机器卖给集体农庄仿佛会加强集体农庄所有制和削弱国家所有制这个所有制的最高形式，这种说法就其实质来说是不正确的。他接着说，集体农庄——合作社所有制和全民所有制之间是有一定的差别的，但这只是同一种社会主义生产方式的不同发展形式而已。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，现在拟定的进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施可以保证集体农庄所有制的扩大并使它接近全民所有制。
    赫鲁晓夫说，集体农庄经济的发展过程是这样的：公积金不断增长，其本质也起了变化，它的结构和社会性质已日益接近于全民的生产基金了。
    他接着说，每一个集体农民现在都懂得，公积金越多，集体农庄能够购买的机器就越多，生产的机械化水平就将更加提高，集体农民的劳动性质将接近于工人的劳动，并且能生产出更多的产品，集体农庄和庄员的收入都将继续增长。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，必须修改从前制订的集体农庄按劳动日分配收入和公积金提成的章程。他说，看来目前公积金的比重要增加。赫鲁晓夫同时指出，不能靠减少按劳动日分配的金额总数来增加公积金的提成。他解释说，公积金提成增加的来源应该是收入总额的增加以及每公顷土地的收入和各种产品收入的增加。
    在谈到调整征购和收购价格的问题时赫鲁晓夫指出，现在这些价格应当予以调整，以刺激生产的发展，保证正当的收入，同时使所有集体农庄都有可能拨出必要数量的资金来购买生产率很高的技术设备。赫鲁晓夫说，在确定农产品价格时，我们应当从正确地按比例发展工农业的利益出发，保证重工业的领导作用。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，技术设备从机器拖拉机站转到集体农庄后就可以更合理地运用机器，提高劳动生产率。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，有人认为机器拖拉机站改组以后会削弱国家对集体农庄的领导作用，这种耽心是毫无根据的。国家仍然掌握着管理经济的一切经济杠杆。
    在谈到把技术设备卖给集体农庄的办法这一问题时，赫鲁晓夫指出，初步计算表明，大多数集体农庄能够马上就购买机器拖拉机站的技术设备。个别地区还可以暂时保存一部分机器拖拉机站来执行它们目前的职能。但是就在这些保留机器拖拉机站的地方，个别集体农庄也可以购买技术设备。在那些经济上薄弱的集体农庄的地区，改组机器拖拉机站可能需要两三年，有的地方还要更长。技术设备的付款期限大概要根据各集体农庄和各地区的经济状况而各有不同。公有经济十分发达和现金收入很高的集体农庄将在一两年内把机器的价款付给国家，中等的集体农庄在两三年内，经济上落后的集体农庄可以规定五年的期限。新的拖拉机和农业机器售给集体农庄一般应当用现款支付，或者根据集体农庄的经济状况贷给它们。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，集体农庄现在有可能在规定的期限内付清购买技术设备的费用。1956年集体农庄提作公积金的款项是一百六十七亿卢布，而集体农庄将从机器拖拉机站购买的技术设备的价值约为二百亿卢布。可见，一年中提作公积金的款项就几乎可以抵偿技术设备的价值。据苏联农业部的计算，在1958年，公积金的提成约将等于二百五十亿卢布，今后并将逐年增长。
    赫鲁晓夫说，预定要建立具有全新职能的国营企业来代替目前的机器拖拉机站，这种企业将称为技术修理站。赫鲁晓夫说，技术修理站不是处在领导集体农庄的地位。它们将成为经济核算企业，全力帮助集体农庄很好地利用和管理拖拉机，执行国家技术监督的职能。
    鉴于集体农庄本身流动资金的增加，赫鲁晓夫建议扩大为集体农庄生产所需要的银行信贷。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出，技术设备和集体农庄所需要的其他商品只能在自愿的基础上出售。他说，看来自由出售机器的方法也应该推广到国营农场。
    机器拖拉机站改组以后，在新的制度下，技术设备将使用得更合理，劳动生产率将提高，产品的生产将增加。这将导致农产品降低成本。结果，国家就有现实可能降低农产品的收购价格，这将使得有可能降低粮食和工业品的零售价格，从而保证人民物质福利的进一步提高。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我们拥有相当丰裕的农产品的时候已经为期不远了。那时收购产品的条件将改变。国家将有可能在那些粮食、肉类和其他产品较便宜的地区购买它们。赫鲁晓夫说，不应当认为，所有这一切都是遥远将来的事情。这里所谈到的问题在目前就具有现实意义。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，党中央委员会认为，实现所拟定的进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施将有助于胜利地实现党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议和促进我国向共产主义前进的运动。（附图片）
