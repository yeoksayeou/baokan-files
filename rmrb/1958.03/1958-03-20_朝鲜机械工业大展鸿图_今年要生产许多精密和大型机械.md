Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 19th: North Korea's newly emerging mechanical industry sector will produce many highly precise and large machines this year to support various production and construction departments.

This year, the planned output value of North Korea's mechanical industry is to increase by 23.5% compared to last year. After discussing this plan at the beginning of the year, the workers decided to set an additional production increase target equal to 7.6% of this year's planned output value. With the development of production in this sector, workers will produce a large number of mining machines for the mining sector this year, such as rock drills, ball mills, ore transporters, and drilling machines; manufacture excavators, giant 42-inch diameter water pumps, and large motors for irrigation projects under construction; and produce a large number of tower cranes for the construction sector. In addition, this year will see the mass production of the SU50 universal lathe, which was successfully trial-produced last year, and also manufacture rolling mills and many machine parts for the recovering steel plants, hydroelectric power stations, and textile factories.

North Korea has attached great importance to the development of the mechanical industry since the war; in the process of implementing the Three-Year Plan from 1954 to 1956, North Korea's investment in the mechanical industry sector accounted for about one-quarter of the total investment in the entire industrial sector. Last year, the Heechon Machine Tool Factory produced a large number of new-style machine tools, the Gihyang Machinery Factory produced more than 7,000 various agricultural machines, and the Guseong Mining Machinery Factory produced complete sets of mining machinery. These are all things that North Korea was unable to produce in the past. Many factories that used to rely on imported machinery for production now use machines made in North Korea themselves for production.

    朝鲜机械工业大展鸿图
    今年要生产许多精密和大型机械
    据新华社平壤19日电  朝鲜战后新兴的机械工业部门今年要生产许多精密度很高的和大型的机械，支援各生产建设部门。
    今年朝鲜机械工业的产值计划比去年增加23.5％。工人们在今年年初讨论了这个计划以后，决定再订出一项追加等于今年计划产值7.6％的增产计划。随着这个部门的生产的发展，工人们今年要为矿山部门生产大量的凿岩机、球磨机、矿石运输机、钻探机等矿山机械，为兴建中的灌溉工程制造掘土机、四十二英寸口径的巨型抽水机和大型电动机，为建设部门生产大批塔式起重机。此外，今年要大量生产去年新试制成功的SU50型的万能旋床，还要为恢复中的钢铁厂、水电站、纺织厂制造轧钢机和许多机器配件。
    朝鲜在战后十分重视发展机械工业；在1954年到1956年执行三年计划的过程中，朝鲜对机械工业部门的投资约占对整个工业部门投资总额的四分之一。去年，熙川机床厂生产了大量的新式机床，岐阳机械工厂生产了七千多台各种农业机器，龟城矿山机械厂生产了成套的矿山机械。这些都是朝鲜过去所不能生产的。许多在过去依靠进口机械进行生产的工厂，现在都用朝鲜自己制造的机械来生产了。
