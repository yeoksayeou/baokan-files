Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 23rd: Antara News Agency reports that Indonesian government troops have recaptured Mamuju City in Sulawesi from armed rebels calling themselves the "Islamic Army." Mamuju is a west coast city north of Makassar, the capital of Sulawesi province, and was seized by the "Islamic Army" more than two months ago.

Government troops, with a force of four companies, attacked the city from both land and sea, completely annihilating the local "Islamic Army" and seizing a batch of gold and important documents.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: Washington News: A U.S. Navy spokesman said on the 22nd that one U.S. cruiser and two destroyers, currently docked in Singapore, are ready to rush to the areas occupied by Indonesian rebels to "evacuate American nationals." He also said that the State Department has not yet requested the Navy to "assist in the evacuation."

The spokesman also said that if necessary, the U.S. Seventh Fleet's aircraft carriers and other ships in the Western Pacific region will also participate in the above-mentioned operations.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: London News: The widely circulated British Sunday newspaper "The People" today expressed concern about the consequences of the United States actively supporting Indonesian rebel groups.

The newspaper said that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had indicated that he would consider recognizing the rebels as belligerents. "Outside the United States, no one says Dulles is doing well. Britain has asked for caution." The newspaper fears that Britain will be dragged down as a result, saying that because the United States is "playing this trick so badly," the result is that "we and the Commonwealth are likely to suffer the greatest losses."

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: TASS, The Hague, March 22nd: The Dutch newspaper "Truth" published a statement by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party regarding the Indonesian events. The statement condemned the right-wing Dutch newspapers "De Telegraaf" and "Het Volk" for calling on the West to transform its secret aid to the Indonesian rebels into open armed intervention in Indonesia. The statement also emphasized the need to convene a top-level meeting between East and West to discuss disarmament and easing international tensions. (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚政府军讨伐“伊斯兰教军”
    收复苏拉威西的马穆祖城
    美舰借口“撤侨”准备开往叛乱地区
    新华社雅加达23日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚政府军队已经从自称为“伊斯兰教军”的武装叛乱分子手里收复了苏拉威西的马穆祖城。马穆祖是苏拉威西省首府望加锡北面的一个西海岸城市，在两个多月前被“伊斯兰教军”窃据。
    政府军队以四个连的兵力从海陆两方面夹攻这个城市，把当地的“伊斯兰教军”全部歼灭，并缴获了一批黄金和重要文件。
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国海军发言人22日说，停泊在新加坡港内的美国巡洋舰一艘，驱逐舰两艘随时准备驰往印度尼西亚叛军盘据地区“撤退美国侨民”。他又说，国务院还没有请求海军“协助撤侨”。
    这位发言人还说，假如必要的话，西太平洋区美国第七舰队的航空母舰和其他舰只也将参与上述行动。
    新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：销路很广的英国星期日报纸“人民报”今天对美国积极支持印度尼西亚叛乱集团的后果表示担心。
    报纸说，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经表示要考虑承认叛乱分子为交战的一方。“在美国以外的地方，没有一个人说杜勒斯搞得很好。英国已经要求谨慎从事。”报纸担心英国将因此受到拖累，它说，由于美国这种把戏“耍得很不好”，结果“受到最大损失的很可能是我们和英联邦”。
    新华社23日讯　塔斯社海牙22日讯：荷兰“真理报”刊载了荷兰共产党中央委员会政治局关于印度尼西亚事件的声明。这个声明谴责右翼荷兰报纸“口号报”和“人民报”呼吁西方把对印度尼西亚叛乱者的秘密援助变成对印度尼西亚的公开武装干涉。声明还着重指出，有必要召开东西方最高级会议来讨论裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的问题。（附图片）
