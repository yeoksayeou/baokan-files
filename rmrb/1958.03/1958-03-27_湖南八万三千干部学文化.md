	Hunan's 83,000 Cadres Study Culture
	(By Our Correspondent) A total of 83,000 cadres in Hunan Province are participating in cultural studies, accounting for 57% of the total number of office cadres in the province who should be studying culture, an increase of 130 times compared to 1950. Before 1952, the classes offered by various cadres' cultural schools (classes) were mainly literacy classes and higher primary classes; now, students studying in junior high school classes account for 61% of all students, and some provinces, special districts, some cities, and individual counties have also opened senior high school classes.

	After cultural studies, the cultural level of the cadres has greatly improved. According to statistics from the first half of last year: through cultural studies, more than 22,900 people have shaken off illiteracy, more than 17,000 people have reached the level of higher primary school graduation, more than 4,000 people have reached the level of junior high school graduation, and some cadres have improved to the level of senior high school students.

	The improvement of cadres' cultural level has created conditions for them to study political theory and delve into their professional work, and has played a positive role in their work. For example, the section chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Changde Municipal People's Committee was originally illiterate. After several years of cultural studies, he can now write simple work summaries, understand documents, and approve internal documents. A cadre in Yongshun Post and Telecommunications Bureau was originally illiterate and unable to carry out his work effectively. Through cultural studies, his work efficiency has doubled.

    湖南八万三千干部学文化
    本报讯　湖南省全省共有八万三千多名干部参加文化学习，占全省应学文化的机关干部总人数的57％，比1950年增加了一百三十倍。1952年以前，各干部文化学校（班）开设的班级主要是扫盲班和高小班；现在在初中班学习的学员已占全部学员的61％，省、专区、部分市及个别县还开办了高中班。
    干部经过文化学习后，文化水平有了很大的提高。据去年上期统计：通过文化学习，已有二万二千九百多人摆脱文盲状态，有一万七千多人达到高小毕业程度，有四千多人达到初中毕业程度，并有一部分干部提高到高中肄业水平。
    干部的文化水平提高了，就为学习政治理论和钻研业务创造了条件，并在工作中起到了积极的作用。如常德市人民委员会民政科科长，原先是个文盲，经过几年的文化学习，现在已能写简单的工作总结，能够看懂文件和审批科内公文了。永顺邮电局一个干部，原来一字不识，工作搞不开，通过文化学习，工作效率提高了一倍。
