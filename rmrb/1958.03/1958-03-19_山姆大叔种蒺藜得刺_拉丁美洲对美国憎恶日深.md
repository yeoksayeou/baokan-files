Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 17th: According to TASS, the dissatisfaction of Latin American countries with the policies of the American ruling group has greatly deepened recently.

    “The Washington Post and Times Herald,” in explaining the relationship between Latin American countries and the United States, wrote that a "unpleasant" situation has emerged in the recent elections in Argentina and Guatemala: "The most pro-American candidates have not succeeded, while the supporters of those who criticize the United States have greatly increased." A "Christian Science Monitor" reporter reported from Mexico that "hatred of the United States" is "one of the most significant trends in political life" in Latin American countries.

    The trade discrimination policy implemented by the American ruling group against Latin American countries has particularly aroused dissatisfaction among Latin American public opinion. The prices of non-ferrous metals exported by many Latin American countries to the United States have recently fallen sharply, which has caused serious damage to the economies of these countries. Some Latin American newspapers have also condemned the so-called "economic assistance" of the United States. Rojas, the editor of Guatemala's "Times," called this assistance "a means of supporting American investors." He wrote, "No one cares about this gift. This gift is only a means of ensuring that we remain vassals of the American empire."

    The people of Latin American countries oppose American interference in the internal affairs of some Latin American countries, which is particularly manifested in the American ruling group's support for dictatorial regimes in some countries.

    Some newspapers pointed out that Latin American countries are now showing increasing interest in establishing trade and other relations with socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union. The Spanish-language magazine "Vision" published in New York recently wrote that this interest is largely due to the scientific and technological achievements of the socialist camp. The newspaper pointed out that many Latin American countries purchase industrial products from socialist countries on more favorable terms than they do from the United States and other capitalist countries.

    山姆大叔种蒺藜得刺
    拉丁美洲对美国憎恶日深
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约17日讯：拉丁美洲各国对美国统治集团的政策的不满近来大大加深了。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”在说明拉丁美洲国家同美国的关系时写道，在不久前举行的阿根廷和危地马拉的选举中出现了一种“令人不愉快”的情况：“最亲近美国的候选人没有成功，而那些抨击美国的候选人的支持者却大大增加。”“基督教科学箴言报”记者自墨西哥报道说，“憎恶美国”是拉丁美洲国家“政治生活中最显著的潮流之一”。
    美国统治集团对拉丁美洲国家所实行的贸易歧视政策特别引起拉丁美洲国家舆论的不满。拉丁美洲许多国家向美国输出的有色金属的价格不久前急剧下降，这给这些国家的经济带来严重损害。一些拉丁美洲国家的报纸还谴责美国的所谓“经济援助”。危地马拉“时报”的编辑罗哈斯把这种援助叫做“支持美国投资商的手段。”他写道，“谁都不稀罕这种礼物。这种礼物只是保证使我们作为美帝国的附庸的一种手段。”
    拉丁美洲各国人民反对美国干涉一些拉丁美洲国家的内政，这种干涉特别表现在美国统治集团支持一些国家的独裁制度上。
    一些报纸指出，拉丁美洲国家现在对同社会主义国家，首先是同苏联建立贸易以及其他关系的兴趣越来越浓厚。在纽约用西班牙文出版的“视界”杂志不久前写道，这种兴趣在很大程度上是由于社会主义阵营各国科学和技术成就引起的。报纸指出，许多拉丁美洲国家在社会主义国家购买工业品，其条件比在美国和其他资本主义国家购买来得优惠。
