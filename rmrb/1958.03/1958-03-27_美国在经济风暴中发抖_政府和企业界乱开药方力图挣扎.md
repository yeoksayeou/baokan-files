Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th - News: The American government and business community are frantically taking measures in an attempt to withstand the increasingly severe economic recession.

After a long period of deliberation, U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a special message to Congress on the 25th, requesting congressional authorization for the government to use 500 to 600 million dollars of government funds to extend the time limit for unemployed workers to receive relief by one-half. According to the laws of various U.S. states, the time limit for unemployed workers in each state to receive unemployment relief varies from six weeks to thirty weeks. Because this time limit is very short, according to official reports, 290,000 unemployed workers had already exhausted their unemployment relief in January and February. It is estimated that a total of two million unemployed workers will exhaust their unemployment relief and receive no income in the year up to the end of March next year.

Eisenhower also said that he would soon ask Congress to authorize the government to accelerate a commodity procurement plan worth 600 million dollars, which would be used in the next fifteen months.

Eisenhower's special message was put forward when the Democratic Party was using the development of the economic recession to fiercely criticize the Republican government. Two days earlier, Democratic Senator Douglas had pointed out that the United States was currently in "a serious recession, trembling on the edge of a depression." Democratic National Committee Chairman Butler also said on the 24th that the United States was experiencing a "full-scale recession," and he accused the government of being responsible for this recession which had "lost control."

In both houses of Congress, members of both parties are putting forward so-called "anti-recession" plans. The Senate has already begun discussing the so-called "Second Anti-Recession Bill" on the 25th: appropriating 5.5 billion dollars this year to build roads. Prior to this, Congress passed the "First Anti-Recession Bill": allocating 1.85 billion dollars to build houses in order to save the rapidly declining housing construction industry. At the same time, there is also much discussion in Congress on the issue of using tax cuts to stimulate economic activity.

At the same time, the American business community is extremely worried about the deepening recession. According to reports, managers from General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Corporation, American Motors Corporation, and Studebaker-Packard Corporation held a meeting on the 24th to plan a "sales campaign" in twenty-three cities in an attempt to reverse the poor car sales situation. It is said that General Motors will launch a "Buy Now" campaign in New York and Brooklyn on April 19. Other major companies have also selected some cities as "promotion" focus points. In addition, many companies in other industries in the United States are also coming up with various tricks to attract customers. For example, in Paterson, New Jersey, a city of 150,000 people that has been severely hit by the recession, a "Believe in America" week was recently launched (note: this slogan is an attempt to restore people's confidence in the future of the American economy). The entire city is covered in slogans, flags and mottos all centered on this theme, and stores will hold special auctions to attract people to buy.

### 美国在经济风暴中发抖  政府和企业界乱开药方力图挣扎

    美国在经济风暴中发抖
    政府和企业界乱开药方力图挣扎
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府和企业界人士正在手忙脚乱地采取措施，企图抵挡日益严重的经济衰退的风暴。
    在经过长时间的斟酌后，美国总统艾森豪威尔25日向国会提出了一个特别咨文，要求国会授权政府动用五亿到六亿美元的政府基金，以便把失业工人领取救济金的时限延长二分之一。根据美国各州的法律规定，各个州失业工人领取失业救济金的时限是六个星期到三十个星期不等。由于这个时限很短，据官方报告，1月份和2月份已经有二十九万失业工人领完了他们的失业救济金。估计在到明年3月底为止的一年中总共将有两百万失业工人陆续领光他们的失业救济金而得不到任何收入。
    艾森豪威尔同时还说，他不久将要求国会授权政府加速总值六亿美元的商品采购计划，这笔钱将在今后十五个月内使用。
    艾森豪威尔的特别咨文是在民主党利用经济衰退的发展猛烈抨击共和党政府的时候提出的。在前两天，民主党参议员道格拉斯曾经指出，美国目前正处在“一次严重的衰退中，它正在萧条的边缘上颤抖着”。民主党全国委员会主席巴特勒24日也说，美国正经历着“全面的衰退”，他指责政府应该对这个“失去了控制”的衰退负责。
    在国会两院里，两党议员正在纷纷提出一些所谓“反衰退”的计划。参议院已经在25日开始讨论所谓“第二号反衰退法案”：在今年拨款五十五亿美元来修筑公路。在这以前，国会通过了“第一号反衰退法案”：拨出十八亿五千万美元来兴建房屋，以挽救住房建筑急剧下降的颓势。同时，在利用减税来刺激经济活动的问题上国会里也正在议论纷纷。
    同时，美国企业界对于衰退日益深重感到极端忧虑。据报道，通用汽车公司、福特汽车公司、克莱斯勒汽车公司、美国汽车公司和史蒂倍克—派克公司的经理们24日举行了一次会议，会上计划在二十三个城市中发动“推销运动”企图挽救汽车销售不佳的状况。据说，通用汽车公司将在4月19日在纽约和布鲁克林发动“现在就买”运动。其他几家大公司也各自挑选一些城市来作为“推销”重点。此外，美国其他行业的许多公司也正在想出种种花样来招徕顾客。例如在新泽西州受到衰退严重打击的十五万人口的城市巴特逊，最近发起了一个“相信美国（按：这个口号是企图挽回人们对美国经济前途的信心）”周。整个城市里的标语、旗帜和口号都是这么一个主题，而商店将进行特价拍卖吸引人们来购买。
