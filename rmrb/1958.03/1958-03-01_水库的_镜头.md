    The film "Moving Mountains and Seas for the Spring Festival," which reflects the theme of celebrating the holiday and continuing construction at the Ming Tombs Reservoir site, has begun filming. The staff accepting the task also broke the usual time frame for producing similar films, aiming to have the inspiring holiday scenes on the construction site meet the audience on the screen within five to seven days.
    The first scene to be filmed was the award ceremony on the construction site on New Year's Eve. With so many advanced individuals to be awarded, they carefully selected the "Seven Sisters," who are renowned throughout the construction site, to be on camera. Doing the same earth-carrying work, with the same number of people, the young men's highest record was thirty-six cubic meters, while these seven farm girls from Shahe Township reached thirty-three cubic meters! Skilled at carrying earth, they were also at ease in front of the camera, each smiling so heartily and purely!
    On New Year's Eve, the construction site was illuminated by thousands of lights, filled with endless laughter. The grand and enthusiastic gala began, with dense layers of reservoir builders sitting around on the beach. The photographers, holding their beloved machines, struggled to squeeze out of this performance area and into that performance area. Wherever the dazzling light of the giant carbon arc lamps shone, it became the focus of people's attention, and the wonderful programs and the lively, smiling faces were captured by the camera. After filming the party, some people followed the generator truck along the dry riverbed into a rugged path, heading to a village. They were preparing to film the villagers' holiday celebrations there.
    The hosts were at the construction site, and the old lady received us. From the kind old village chief, we learned that this place was being relocated to make way for fish to live there. No wonder the roads were uneven and the "village appearance" was so unkempt.
    The rumbling of the generator and the strong lighting dispersed the midnight silence. The villagers and the filmmakers spent a unique New Year's Eve in the future reservoir bottom together. Staying up all night, pasting festive paper cuttings, setting off firecrackers, and other activities were successfully filmed with enthusiastic help, followed by filming dumpling making.
    The work ended at cockcrow, and the deafening sound of cannons came from afar. A large explosion was carried out on the construction site, and the builders' holiday battle began.
    By the third day of the new year, all filming work was completed; thanks to the efforts of the post-production staff, the film was finally completed within the deadline.

    水库的“镜头”
    易卜
    以反映十三陵水库工地过节、施工两不误为主题的影片“移山造海过春节”开始拍摄了。接受任务的工作人员也打破了平时拍同类影片出片时间的常规，要在五天到七天之内，让工地上激动人心的节日景象在银幕上和观众见面。
    首先要拍的是除夕下午工地上的发奖大会。受奖的先进人物那么多，精筛细选，誉满工地的“七姊妹”上了镜头。一样的挑土工作、一样的人数，年轻小伙子们的最高纪录是三十六方，而这七个来自沙河乡的农家姑娘，却达到了三十三方！挑土是能手，拍电影也不含糊，镜头面前，一个个笑得那么爽朗、纯真！
    除夕，工地上明灯万盏，升腾着无尽的欢笑。盛大热烈的晚会开始了，沙滩上围坐着密密层层的水库建设者。摄影师们怀抱着心爱的机器，艰难地挤出这一表演区又挤进那一表演区。耀眼的巨型炭精灯的光芒射向哪里，哪里便形成吸引人们注意力的地方，精采的节目和一张张生气勃勃、笑容满脸的面孔，都被摄入了镜头。拍完联欢晚会，一部分人又随着发电车沿干涸的河床折入崎岖小道，驶进一座村庄。准备在这里拍摄老乡们过节的情景。
    主人在工地上，老大娘接待了我们。从慈祥的老村长口里，才知道这里要让鱼儿来住家，正在拆迁。这就难怪道路坑洼不平，“村容”也那么不整了。
    隆隆的发电机声和强烈的照明灯光驱散了午夜的沉寂。老乡们和电影工作者一起在未来的水底度过一个别有风味的除夕。守岁、贴喜花、放爆竹等在热情的帮助下顺利拍完，接着又拍包饺子。
    鸡鸣时分结束了工作，远处传来震耳的炮声，工地上进行了大爆破，建设者们节日的战斗开始了。
    到初三为止，完成了全部拍摄工作；经过后期制作人员的努力，影片终于在限期内完成了。
