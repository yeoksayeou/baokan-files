Using Artificial Snow Melting on the Frozen Land
Heilongjiang Farmers Actively Prepare for Spring Planting

(Our dispatch) Heilongjiang farmers are actively engaged in artificial snow melting activities in order to sow seeds in a timely manner. Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of our country, experienced the heaviest snowfall last winter in thirty-six years, and the land is still covered in snow. If it is left to melt naturally, it will affect this spring's planting. The farmers in various places have once again demonstrated their determination to conquer nature and have widely carried out artificial snow melting activities. In the vast silver fields, men and women are driving sledges pulled by cattle and horses, large tree branches, disc harrows, and scoops, breaking through the one- or two-foot-deep snow, and drawing black stripes, exposing the original face of the fertile soil. According to the statistics of Suihua Prefecture alone, more than 50,000 people have carried out snow melting work on more than 600,000 mu of cultivated land. Hailun County mobilized thousands of people and horses, fighting day and night. Their slogan is: Eliminate the snow as soon as possible and plant in a timely manner. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have also created many novel and effective snow melting methods. Dengyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Huachuan County uses the method of sprinkling small ash on the fields to make the snow melt earlier. Agricultural cooperatives in Wuchang County moved the snow from the low-lying areas with more snow to the high-lying areas, so that the low-lying areas were spared from spring flooding, and the high-lying areas were spared from spring drought. Shangzhi, Boli, and other counties have carried out winter rice field plowing in conjunction with artificial snow melting.

    在千里冰原上用人工化雪
    黑龙江农民积极准备春播工作
    本报讯　黑龙江农民正在积极进行人工化雪活动，以便适时下种。我国最北方的黑龙江省去冬降了三十六年来没有过的大雪，至今大地上还是一片积雪。如果听其自然融化，势将影响今春播种。各地农民又拿出了征服大自然的决心，广泛地进行了人工化雪活动。在辽阔的银色田野上，男男女女赶着牛马拖带的雪撬、大树枝、圆盘耙、捞子等，冲破一、两尺深的积雪，划出一道道黑色带子，使沃土露出原来的面貌。仅据绥化专区的统计，就有五万多人在六十多万亩耕地上进行了化雪工作。海伦县出动了千人万马，日夜连战。他们的口号是：早日消灭积雪，适时播种。各地农业社还创造了许多新奇有效的化雪方法。桦川县灯原农业社用向田里撒小灰的方法使雪早化。五常县农业社把积雪较多的低洼地里的雪，搬到高岗地里，让低洼地免除春涝，高岗地免除春旱。尚志、勃利等县结合人工化雪，进行了稻田冬翻活动。
