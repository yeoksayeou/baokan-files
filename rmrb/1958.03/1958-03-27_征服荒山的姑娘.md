A story is circulating in Henan about a young girl, Guo Xian, who led the masses to conquer Mount Jiu. Not long ago, Guo Xian was awarded the title of "Outstanding Communist Youth League Member." People say she is a girl with ambition.

Traveling seventy *li* northwest from Yuxian County in Henan, one can see from afar a large mountain rising 590 meters above sea level. That is Mount Jiu. It is a famous barren mountain. Every time there is a heavy rain, mountain torrents surge and streams rush through the valleys. The farmers here have a true depiction from their many years of practical life: "It's hard to farm on poor mountains and bad waters, fearing both floods and droughts. We work hard every year without rest, and nine out of ten years are lean!"

Before liberation, this kind of impoverished life left an unforgettable mark on Guo Xian's mind, even though she was less than ten years old at the time.

In the snowy winter of 1956, Wang Youliang, the deputy head of Xuegou Township, returned from Daquanshan in Shanxi after studying methods of managing mountains. Farmers then began discussing mountain management. At this time, Lü Shuzhen, a female agricultural technician from Daquanshan in Shanxi, became Guo Xian's best friend. She told Guo Xian about Daquanshan's past desolation and present beauty, greatly arousing Guo Xian's interest in mountain management. Guo Xian thought, how wonderful it would be if Mount Jiu could be managed like Daquanshan in Shanxi! At that time, Mount Jiu would not be a poor mountain, but a land of rice and grain.

When the Youth League Secretary Su Debo conveyed the township's requirements for mountain management at the Youth League branch meeting – "Only allow green trees to cover the sky on the mountain, and never allow floods to overflow again" – and announced the establishment of a youth construction team in Xuegou Township, Guo Xian was the first to sign up to participate in mountain management.

Guo Xian's dream finally came true. The Party branch approved her application to be a construction team member according to her wishes, and everyone elected her as the deputy captain of the construction team. They encountered difficulties in finding housing on Mount Jiu from the very beginning. In the desolate wilderness, where would they find ready-made houses to live in? So they lived in dilapidated cave dwellings.

The comrades of the construction team began to fight against the barren mountain that had been neglected for thousands of years. At that time, the earth was frozen as hard as stone, and the hoe bounced back as if it had hit a ball. But Guo Xian still used the hoe to dig the barren mountain, digging hard even when she couldn't. Like the other team members, Guo Xian's hands were swollen from the hoe. Waking up at night, Guo Xian thought about a series of questions: Mount Jiu has more than 1,500 mu of land. How long will it take to dig up such a large barren mountain? How much sweat and blood will it take? But then she remembered the distant past: how many houses were destroyed by mountain floods, how many people suffered from hunger and starvation, and had no homes to return to... Now, the Party is leading the farmers on the road to liberation. As soon as she thought of the Party and the future happiness, the courage to overcome difficulties came up. So she mustered her energy again.

The next day, the youth construction team continued to advance towards the barren mountain, but the number of female team members decreased from eight to only Guo Xian. Several male team members also bid farewell to this barren mountain. This was indeed a critical moment to test everyone. At this time, Guo Xian, who had just turned seventeen, did not put down her tools and run home. She and the captain Su Debo said to the remaining team members, we must persevere to the end until the barren mountain is managed well. Today's hardship is for future happiness.

At first, the fish-scale pits dug by Guo Xian were not up to standard. Later, she often asked Lü Shuzhen for advice and quickly learned many skills of mountain management, such as digging contour lines, dams, and dry canals. Every day when going up the mountain, Guo Xian was always ahead of others. She created the highest record of digging fifteen fish-scale pits a day in the youth construction team.

Summer projects are most easily washed away by floods. Guo Xian often ran to the mountains in heavy rain to check the completed projects. Once, she and a male team member were observing the rainfall on the hillside. Fearing that others would get wet and catch a cold, she took off her raincoat and gave it to others. She squatted in the rain for more than four hours, her whole body soaked. Guo Xian used her exemplary actions to encourage the team members to fight against difficulties!

Last February, they built five neat new cave dwellings on the hillside of this mountain, with the slogan "Protect water and soil as if protecting life, manage mountains and ditches as if managing the home" written horizontally above the cave entrances. Guo Xian truly regarded mountain management as managing the home. This feeling can be seen from her handling of marriage issues. Guo Xian was already engaged to Zhao Yongxing, a young commune member from Zhao Gou, and the two had always been very close. Zhao Yongxing's father, Zhao Tongji, had long planned to hold a wedding for his son. Guo Xian was not indifferent to her marriage, but she thought that she still had the glorious task of "mountain management" in front of her. How could she let herself leave this mountain and go to her husband's house after getting married? It would not be too late to get married after the mountain was managed well. Otherwise, it would be okay to get married first, but with one condition, that is, Zhao Yongxing would come to the mountain to "manage the mountain" together. The story of Guo Xian's temporary postponement of marriage became a popular topic for a while. Guo Xian and all the members of the construction team paved the way for the management of Mount Jiu. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the farmers of Yuxian County, with unparalleled heroism, have conquered Mount Jiu. In the past, fetching water required carrying it back from several *li* away, and in some places, digging more than several *zhang* deep still could not produce water. Now, thanks to the construction of water and soil conservation projects, the groundwater level in the mountainous area has risen. From then on, farmers no longer worry about water. The plains are no longer flooded. Mount Jiu has finally been conquered by the local working people. Now, it has been achieved that "water does not go down the mountain, and soil does not leave the river valley." People have realized the determination to "change the mountain's appearance and ask for grain from the water." In this less than one year, more than 23,000 fish-scale pits have been built on Mount Jiu. In addition, there are 27 kinds of projects such as contour lines, dry canals, dams, and quick-forming terraces. Last year's flood season played a huge role in storing water and conserving soil. According to last year's incomplete statistics, grain production has increased by more than 14,000 *jin*. Soil erosion has been controlled in an area of more than 1,500 *mu*.

Now the appearance of Mount Jiu has been completely renewed. 130,000 various fruit trees have been planted on the mountain. In a few years, Mount Jiu will become a mountain of fruits and flowers according to the wishes of the people.

### 征服荒山的姑娘

    征服荒山的姑娘
    河南流传着年轻的姑娘——郭仙带动群众征服鸠山的故事。不久前，郭仙荣获“优秀共青团员”称号。人们都说她是一位有志气的姑娘。
    沿着河南禹县县城往西北行走七十华里，从远处就可以发现一个拔海五百九十公尺高的大山。那就是鸠山。它是有名的荒山，每遇暴雨，山洪滚滚，万谷争流。这里的农民从多年来的实际生活中有这样一段千真万确的描绘：“穷山恶水种地难，又怕涝来又怕旱，年年劳苦不得闲，十年还有九年歉！”
    解放前这种穷苦的生活，那怕当时郭仙还是不满十岁的孩子，心灵上也留下了难忘的迹象。
    1956年大雪纷飞的寒冬，薛沟乡副乡长王友良同志从山西大泉山学习治山办法归来，于是，农民纷纷议论治山。这个时候，由山西大泉山来的女农民技术员吕淑贞，她成了郭仙最好的朋友，她把大泉山的过去的荒凉和现在的美好逐一讲给郭仙听，大大激起了郭仙治山的兴趣。郭仙想，假若能把鸠山治理得像山西大泉山一样，该多美呀！到那时候，鸠山就不是穷山，而是米粮川了。
    当团支书苏德波在团支部大会上传达了乡的治山要求“只准山上绿树遮满天，不准洪水再泛滥”，并要在薛沟乡成立青年基建队的时候，郭仙第一个报名参加治山。
    郭仙的理想终于如愿以偿，党支部按照她的志愿批准为基建队员，大家选她为基建队副队长。他（她）们在鸠山上，一开始就遇到了住房子的困难。荒山野坡里，那里会有现成的房子给他（她）们住，于是就住在破旧的窑洞里。
    基建队的同志们，开始向几千年来无人过问的荒山搏斗了。当时大地冻结如石，镢头下去像皮球掉在地上一样顶了回来。但郭仙还是照样用镢头刨着荒山，刨不动也要硬刨。同其他队员一样，镢头把郭仙的手震肿了。夜里醒来，郭仙想着一连串的问题：鸠山土地一千五百余亩，这样大的荒山，要刨到几时才完？要流多少汗、多少血？但她又想起遥远的过去：多少房屋被山洪冲毁，多少人挨饥受饿，无家可归……如今，党领导农民走翻身路。她一想到党，想到未来的幸福，克服困难的勇气就上来了。于是她又鼓足了干劲。
    第二天，青年基建队继续向荒山进军，妇女队员却从八人减到只剩下郭仙一人了，有几个男队员也向这座荒山告别了。这确是考验每个人的紧要关头。刚满十七岁的郭仙，在这个时候里，不是放下工具跑回家，她和队长苏德波却向留下的队员们说，我们要坚持到底，直到把荒山治好为止。今天的艰苦就是为了今后的幸福。
    起初，郭仙挖的鱼鳞坑很不合规格，后来，她经常向吕淑贞求教，很快就学会了治山的许多本事，如挖水平线、谷坊、旱渠等。每天上山，郭仙总是走在别人前面，她在青年基建队里创造了一天挖十五个鱼鳞坑的最高纪录。
    夏季工程最容易被洪水冲垮。郭仙常在大雨天中跑到山上去检查已经修建起来的工程。有一次，她和男队员在山腰上观察雨量，她怕别人淋湿冻病，把自己的雨衣脱给别人穿，她在雨地里一直蹲了四个多钟头，身上全被淋透。郭仙就是这样用自己的模范行动去带动队员们向困难做斗争！
    去年2月，他（她）们在这座山的山腰修建了五个整整齐齐的新窑洞，洞口上面横写着：“保水保土如保命，治山治沟如治家”的标语。郭仙真正是把治山看成了治家，这种感情从她处理结婚问题可以看出来。郭仙早和赵沟青年社员赵永行订了婚，两人一直很要好。赵永行的父亲赵同吉，早就打算给儿子办喜事了。郭仙对自己的婚事也并不是无动于衷，但她想，在她面前还有一个“治山”的光荣任务，结了婚，让人离开这座山去婆家，这怎能行，等把山治好了结婚不迟。要不然，先结婚也可以，但有一个条件，那就是要赵永行一道进山来“治山”。郭仙暂时不结婚的佳话，一时传为美谈。郭仙和基建队全体队员为治理鸠山开辟了道路。现在，禹县农民在党的领导下，以无比的英雄气概，已经征服了鸠山。过去，吃水要到好几里以外往回担，有些地方挖几丈多深还挖不出水来。现在，由于兴修了水土保持工程，山区地下水位提高了，从此农民再也不愁水吃了。平原地再也没有受淹现象了。鸠山终于被当地劳动人民征服了。如今，做到了“水不下山，土不出川”。人们实现了“叫山变样，向水要粮”的决信。在这还不满一年的时间里，鸠山修建了二万三千多个鱼鳞坑，此外，还有水平线、旱渠、谷坊、速成梯田等二十七种工程。去年汛期发挥了蓄水保土的巨大作用。据去年的不完全统计，已增产粮食一万四千多斤。控制了水土流失土地面积一千五百多亩。
    现在鸠山的面貌已焕然一新，山上已种植了各种水果树十三万株。几年后，鸠山将根据人民的愿望变成一座花果山。
