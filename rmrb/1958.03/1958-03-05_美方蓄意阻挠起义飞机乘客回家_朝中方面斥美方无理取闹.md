Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th: The Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong reports: At the suggestion of the US side, a meeting of the secretaries-general of the Military Armistice Commission was held on the 3rd. The secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side sternly refuted the unreasonable demand made by the US side at the meeting to repatriate those among the people who arrived in northern Korea on the uprising South Korean civil aviation plane who wished to return home through the secretaries-general meeting, and repeatedly emphasized that the issue of extraditing the above-mentioned people had nothing to do with the secretaries-general meeting. This issue can only be resolved through negotiations between the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the South Korean authorities and other relevant governments.

The secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side reminded the US side of the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic on March 1 regarding the extradition of two American and two West German citizens, and pointed out that the US side raised the issue, which has nothing to do with the Military Armistice Commission, at the secretaries-general meeting in order to obstruct the realization of the wishes of those who came on the uprising plane and want to return home.

The secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side also stated that if the US side brought a plan from the South Korean authorities and other relevant governments regarding the extradition of the above-mentioned personnel, the Korean-Chinese side could forward it upwards. If the US side notifies the Korean-Chinese side of the names of the people requesting extradition and the time and place of extradition, the Korean-Chinese side can also report it upwards. The secretary-general of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that if this is done, the wishes of those who want to return home can be quickly realized.

The US side repeatedly reiterated the demands and arguments that had already been refuted by the Korean-Chinese side at the meeting, prolonging the meeting to more than five hours, and clamored to refuse to prepare a "political meeting," which in fact was refusing to accept the legitimate plan of the Korean-Chinese side.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 4th: According to a dispatch from the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong, a portion of the Koreans, Germans, and Americans among those who arrived in northern Korea on the South Korean civil aviation plane on February 16, who wish to return to their hometowns, will be handed over to the relevant parties in Panmunjom on the 6th.

The Korean-Chinese side today suggested to the US side that a meeting of the secretaries-general of the Military Armistice Commission be held in Panmunjom at 12:00 on the 6th. At the same time, for the return of the above-mentioned people, it has been suggested that representatives of the South Korean Red Cross, representatives of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, and representatives of the US government participate in the meeting.

    美方蓄意阻挠起义飞机乘客回家
    朝中方面斥美方无理取闹
    新华社平壤4日电　朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在美方建议下，3日举行了军事停战委员会秘书长会议。朝中方面秘书长严正驳斥了美方在会上提出的经过秘书长会议遣返乘起义的南朝鲜民航机到达朝鲜北部的人们中希望回家的人的无理要求，并且再三强调，关于引渡上述人们的问题同秘书长会议毫无关系，这个问题只能由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府同南朝鲜当局和其他有关政府进行谈判才能解决。
    朝中方面秘书长提醒美方注意共和国外务省3月1日发表的关于引渡美国和西德公民各两名的声明，并且指出，美方把同军事停战委员会没有任何关系的问题提到秘书长会议上来，是为了阻挠那些乘坐起义飞机来的想回家的人们的愿望的实现。
    朝中方面秘书长还表明，如果美方带来了南朝鲜当局和其他有关政府关于引渡上述人员的方案，朝中方面可以向上转达。如果美方把要求引渡的人的姓名和引渡的时间和地点通知朝中方面，朝中方面也可以向上报告。朝中方面秘书长指出，如果这样做，希望回家的人们的愿望就可以迅速得到实现。
    美方在会上一再重复早已被朝中方面驳斥了的要求和主张，把会议拖长到五个小时以上，并且叫嚣拒绝准备“政治性会议”，事实上就是拒绝接受朝中方面的正当方案。
    新华社平壤4日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社在开城获悉的消息，6日将在板门店把在2月16日乘坐起义的南朝鲜民航飞机到达朝鲜北部的人们中希望回到自己家乡的一部分朝鲜人、德国人和美国人交给有关方面。
    朝中方面今天向美方建议在6日12时在板门店召开军事停战委员会秘书长会议。同时，为了上述人们的归还，已经建议让南朝鲜红十字会的代表、德意志联邦共和国政府的代表和美国政府的代表参加会议。
