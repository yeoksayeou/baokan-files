Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The wreckage of a U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek RB-57 jet reconnaissance plane, shot down by the Naval Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army during the Spring Festival, has recently been salvaged from the sea. The wreckage of this U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek plane, including the wings and fuselage, is approximately 19 meters long and weighs about 20 tons.

This U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek plane was shot down by the Naval Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on February 18th this year at 11:35 a.m. while it intruded into the airspace over Zhucheng, Jiaoxian, Jimo, and other areas of the Shandong Peninsula for reconnaissance activities.

After this U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek plane was shot down by our army, the U.S. Department of Defense Air Force spokesman hurriedly denied it on the same day, saying, "No such twin-engine jet light bomber has been delivered to the Chinese Kuomintang Air Force." (Attached picture)

    我击落的美造蒋机残骸捞出
    看美国怎能否认
    新华社29日讯　中国人民解放军海军航空兵在春节期间击落的一架美造蒋机RB—57型喷气侦察机的残骸，最近已从海里被打捞出来。这架美造蒋机的残骸机翼、机身各长约十九公尺，重约二十吨。
    这架美造蒋机是今年2月18日十一时三十五分，在窜入山东半岛诸城、胶县、即墨等地上空进行骚扰侦察活动时，被中国人民解放军海军航空兵击落的。
    这架美造蒋机被我军击落后，美国国防部空军发言人曾在当天连忙否认说：“没有一架这种双引擎的喷气式轻轰炸机交给中国国民党空军。”（附图片）
