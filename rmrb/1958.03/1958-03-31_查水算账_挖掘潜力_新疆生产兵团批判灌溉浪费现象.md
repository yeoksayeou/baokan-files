Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 30th. The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps recently held a water conservancy work conference, using the method of investigating water accounts to tap the huge potential of water. This will not only fully meet the irrigation needs of nearly four million mu of cultivated land and the water needed for alkali washing of wasteland this year, but also save enough water to irrigate more than one million mu of land.

The conference pointed out that in the past, the production and construction corps' reclamation areas had a bias towards emphasizing engineering while neglecting management. The utilization rate of water conservancy engineering equipment was only half, causing some farmland to be threatened by drought.

In order to adapt to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in 1958, the conference also proposed to make full use of floods and strengthen drainage projects in low-lying areas to expand the irrigated area. In terms of irrigation management, vigorously promote planned water use, so as to "one basin of water for one jin of grain, every drop returns to the field." In terms of engineering construction, oppose the practice of "seeking perfection and grandeur" and pursuing "modernization standards."

    查水算账　挖掘潜力
    新疆生产兵团批判灌溉浪费现象
    新华社乌鲁木齐30日电新疆军区生产建设兵团最近召开的水利工作会议，用查水算账的方法，挖掘出巨大的水的潜力，不仅充分满足了今年近四百万亩耕地灌溉和荒地洗碱用水，还可节余出灌溉一百多万亩土地的水量。
    会议指出，生产兵团各垦区过去由于存在着重工程轻管理的偏向，水利工程设备的利用率只有一半，致使一些农田还受到旱灾的威胁。
    为了适应1958年在天山南北大规模开垦荒地，会议还提出了要尽量利用洪水和加强洼地排水工程，以扩大灌溉面积。在灌溉管理方面，大力推行计划用水，作到“一盆水一斤粮，点滴归田”。在工程建设方面，反对“求全求大”追求“现代化标准”的作法。
