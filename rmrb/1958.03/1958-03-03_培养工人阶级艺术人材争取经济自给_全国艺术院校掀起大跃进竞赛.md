Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd. Leaders of national higher art institutions and some secondary art schools adopted a Great Leap Forward competition proposal for art education at a conference of art school presidents convened by the Ministry of Culture on the 1st.

The competition proposal pointed out that, in order to achieve a Great Leap Forward in art education, it is first necessary to more resolutely implement the class line and cultivate intellectuals from the working class who are both red and expert. In the next five years, the proportion of worker and peasant students in art institutions nationwide should reach 60% to 70%. Strive to have leftists account for 70% of the faculty and staff in each school in the next five years. Strive to achieve partial, substantial, or complete savings of state funding in the next two to three years.

The meeting promoted a Great Leap Forward in thought and action among the leaders of the various art institutions. They launched challenges to each other at the meeting on how to do a good job of "three diligences" and "three releases." The person in charge of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts decided to further reform the teaching system and methods, organize students to engage in labor production in conjunction with their majors, and guarantee complete economic self-sufficiency within one year. Leaders of other art institutions of drama, film, music, opera, dance, etc. also expressed their willingness to accept the challenge and put forward their own plans.

Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, made a concluding speech at the meeting on March 1st. Liu Zhiming said that this meeting was a Great Leap Forward in thought and action, and the beginning of a second, more profound and extensive ideological and political revolution in the field of art education since the anti-Rightist struggle last year, which will have a decisive impact on the future of China's art education.

Liu Zhiming pointed out that the main obstacle currently affecting the Great Leap Forward in art institutions is right-leaning conservative thinking. He hoped that the leaders of various art institutions would recognize the reality and possibility of the Great Leap Forward and become firm revolutionaries. He called on everyone to boldly and freely mobilize all faculty, staff, and students to conduct a great airing of views, a great rectification, and a great transformation on the reform of teaching, to struggle against bourgeois ideology manifested in art education work, and to thoroughly solve the "detachment from the masses, detachment from reality, and detachment from national traditions" problems that have long not been resolved in art institutions. Liu Zhiming said that after the comprehensive and in-depth development of teaching reform, attention should also be paid to preventing possible tendencies to only emphasize production labor and neglect teaching.

Liu Zhiming pointed out that the principle of combining teaching with labor production is also unified with improving teaching quality, and not contradictory. The main purpose of the Great Leap Forward is to improve teaching quality. In the future, we should pay attention to realizing the correct combination of teaching and labor production. It is wrong to only want teaching and not production, and it is also wrong to only want production and not teaching. Of course, erroneous practices that may occur in teaching work, such as failing to pay attention to basic training and neglecting to improve theoretical and technical knowledge, must be opposed.

Liu Zhiming said that art institutions must not only strive to complete the economic task of achieving self-sufficiency, but more importantly, they must also complete the political task of cultivating working-class artistic talents who are both red and expert. Neither can be neglected.

### 培养工人阶级艺术人材争取经济自给  全国艺术院校掀起大跃进竞赛

    培养工人阶级艺术人材争取经济自给
    全国艺术院校掀起大跃进竞赛
    据新华社2日讯　全国高等艺术院校和部分中等艺术学校的负责人1日在文化部召开的艺术院校长会议上，通过了艺术教育大跃进的竞赛书。
    竞赛书指出，为了使艺术教育大跃进，首先必须更坚决地贯彻阶级路线，培养又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。今后五年内全国各艺术院校中工农学生的比例要达到60％到70％。争取今后五年内各校教职员中的左派达到70％。争取在今后两三年内做到节约国家经费的一部、大部或全部。
    会议促进了各艺术院校负责人从思想到行动来一个大跃进。他们在会上就如何作好“三勤”、“三放”，相互展开挑战。中央工艺美术学院的负责人决定进一步改革教学制度和方法，组织学生结合所学专业进行劳动生产，在一年内保证经济上达到完全自给。其他戏剧、电影、音乐、戏曲、舞蹈等艺术院校的负责人也都表示应战，并提出了自己的规划。
    文化部副部长刘芝明3月1日在会议上作了总结发言。刘芝明说，这次会议是个思想上行动上的大跃进，是继去年反右派斗争以后，艺术教育界的第二场思想上政治上更为深刻和广泛的大革命的开端，它将对中国的艺术教育事业的前途产生决定性的影响。
    刘芝明指出，当前影响艺术院校大跃进的主要障碍是右倾保守思想，他希望各艺术院校负责人认识到大跃进的现实性和可能性，都做坚定的革命派。他号召大家，大胆地放手发动全体教职员工和学生就改革教学进行大鸣大放，大整大改，同表现在艺术教育工作中的资产阶级思想进行斗争，彻底解决艺术院校中长期没有得到解决的“脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离民族传统”的问题。刘芝明说，在教学改革全面和深入展开以后，也要注意防止可能产生的只强调生产劳动，忽视教学等偏向。
    刘芝明指出，实行教学同劳动生产相结合的方针同提高教学质量也是统一的而不是矛盾的，大跃进的主要目的是要提高教学质量。今后应当注意实现教学与劳动生产的正确结合，只要教学不要生产是错误的，只要生产不要教学也是错误的。对教学工作中不注意基本训练、忽视提高理论和技术知识水平等可能发生的错误作法，当然要加以反对。
    刘芝明说，艺术院校既要努力完成争取自给的经济任务，更重要的还必须完成政治任务，培养出又红又专的工人阶级的艺术人才。二者不可偏废。
