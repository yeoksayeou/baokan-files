    Welcoming the Volunteers, Two Poems
    Wu Yinyi
    I participated in the Chinese People's Representative Delegation, accompanying elders Chen Shutong, Wang Weizhou, and Shao Lizi, from Beijing to Andong, to welcome the victorious return of the Volunteers, and composed these poems.
    Banners fluttering, drums resounding thunderously,
    Eighty thousand vanguards triumphantly return.
    The elders, many over seventy years old,
    Traveled a long road of nearly three thousand;
    Soft breezes on the Yalu welcome spring swallows,
    Hot blood, scarlet red, offer azaleas.
   [Note] The most beloved people are intimately consoled,
    Songs and heroic spirit resonate through the mountains and rivers.
   [Note] Andong has many azaleas; among the flowers offered to the Volunteers, red azaleas were the most numerous.
    The whole city, old and young, welcomes them,
    Embracing and singing with boundless affection.
    Ten thousand generations of history will praise their achievements,
    The will of the people of the five continents belongs to peace.
    How can we only expect peaceful sleep in the East?
    We fear not the Western barbarians' failure to withdraw their troops!
    Should the stubborn enemy dare to cross the ceasefire line,
    The three armies will advance, and I will follow.
                   March 16th, Andong.

    迎志愿军二首
    吴研因
    参加中国人民代表团，随陈叔通、王维舟、邵力子诸老，自京至安东，欢迎志愿军胜利归国，即赋。旌旗招展鼓喧阗，八万前锋奏凯旋。诸老年多逾七十，漫长路欲及三千；软风鸭绿迎春燕，热血猩红献杜鹃。
   〔注〕最可爱人亲慰问，歌声壮气荡山川。
   〔注〕安东多杜鹃，向志愿军所献花，以红杜鹃为最多。倾城老幼尽相迎，拥抱讴歌无限情。万世史书褒战绩，五洲民意属和平。岂徒东国期安枕？那怕西戎不撤兵！顽敌敢逾停战线，三军进击我随行。
                   三月十六日，安东。
