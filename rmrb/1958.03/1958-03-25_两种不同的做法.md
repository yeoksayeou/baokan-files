Two Different Approaches
Yu Ruo

The combination of mass power and technical power is a fundamental experience in the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Campaign.

How to solve this problem? According to the current situation in various places, there are two different methods. One method is for leaders at all levels to lead scientific and technical personnel to go deep into the masses, summarize and promote the masses' experiences and methods for eliminating the four pests. For example, the Four Pests Elimination Experience Exchange Conference held in Sichuan Province summarized 153 methods; Jiangsu Province summarized more than 60 methods and also held training classes to pass on the methods of rat-catching expert Yang Zhaocai, sparrow-catching expert Zhu Qiaoguan, and Chen Falin to the masses; Xinhui County in Guangdong Province also established a technical guidance network to strengthen technical guidance. In places where the above measures have been taken, technical guidance has quickly caught up with the requirements of the campaign and has powerfully promoted the accelerated progress of the campaign. For example, when Chongqing besieged and suppressed rats, it annihilated 1.08 million rats in seven days and nights by adopting the three-pronged approach of poisonous bait, sulfur fumigation, and tool-based capture and beating.

The other approach is the opposite of the first. Some leaders in certain regions and units regard the technical guidance of the entire campaign as the responsibility of a few scientific and technical personnel, focusing their attention on asking higher authorities for personnel and methods, not delving into specific problems, and being satisfied with the methods already mastered by scientific and technical personnel, while neglecting to promote the increasing number of new methods created by the broad masses in the campaign.

It is clear that the former approach is correct and the latter approach is wrong. The fundamental point of divergence between them lies in the fact that the former method is that leaders and scientific and technical personnel believe in the creativity of the masses, go deep into the masses, and earnestly summarize and promote the experience of the masses; the latter method is that they do not believe in the creativity of the masses, only value the methods already in books, and do not value the new methods created by the masses in the current campaign. In short, the fundamental difference between them lies in whether they are combined with practice and the masses.

Facts have proven that the people of the whole country have created many miracles and a large amount of valuable experience on the Four Pests Elimination front. There are many effective methods that scientific and technical personnel cannot yet give scientific explanations for. It should be said that those who underestimate the creativity of the masses on the Four Pests Elimination front have hindered the development of the Four Pests Elimination.

In order to promote the in-depth development of the Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Campaign, leaders at all levels should value the wisdom of the masses, mobilize scientific and technical personnel to go deep into the field, work together with the masses in the campaign, and promptly summarize and promote the experience of the masses.

    两种不同的做法
    雨若
    群众力量和技术力量相结合，是除四害讲卫生运动的一条根本经验。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？根据目前各地的情况，有两种不同的办法。一种办法，是各级领导干部带动科学技术人员，深入群众，总结推广群众除四害的经验和办法。如四川省召开的除四害经验交流会，就总结出一百五十三种办法；江苏省总结了六十多种办法，还举办了训练班，把捕鼠能手杨兆才、捕雀能手朱巧官、陈发林的办法传授给群众；广东省新会县为了加强技术指导，还建立了技术指导网。凡是采取以上措施的地方，技术指导很快就赶上了运动的要求，并且有力地推动了运动的加速进展。如重庆市在围剿老鼠时，由于采用了毒饵诱杀、硫磺熏杀、工具捕打三管齐下的办法，七昼夜就歼灭了老鼠一百零八万只。
    另一种做法与前一种恰恰相反。有些地区和单位的领导上，把整个运动的技术指导，看做是少数科学技术人员的事，把注意力集中在向上级要人要办法上面，不深入研究具体问题，并且，满足于科学技术人员已经掌握的一些办法，忽视推广广大群众在运动中所创造的越来越多的新办法。
    由此可见，前面一种做法是正确的，后面一种做法是错误的。它们的根本分歧点，就在于前一种办法，是领导和科技人员相信群众的创造力，深入群众，认真地总结并推广群众的经验；后一种办法，则是不相信群众的创造力，只重视过去书本上已有的办法，不重视当前运动中群众所创造出来的新办法。简而言之，它们的根本区别就在于是否结合实际和结合群众。
    事实证明，全国人民在除四害战线上创造了许多奇迹，也创造了大量的宝贵经验。有好多行之有效的办法，科学技术人员还无法给以科学的解释。应该说，那些轻视群众在除四害战线上的创造性的人，阻碍了除四害的开展。
    为了促进除四害讲卫生运动的深入开展，各地各级领导，应该重视群众的智慧，发动科学技术人员深入现场，与群众在运动中打成一片，及时地总结并推广群众的经验。
