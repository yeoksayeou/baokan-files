Advocating a Study Style of Arduous Labor
Liu Danian

In the Great Leap Forward of philosophy and social sciences, I believe that we must first resolutely implement Comrade Chen Boda's proposal of "emphasizing the present, de-emphasizing the past, and learning while doing." This proposal points out where to leap from and where to leap to, and also points out what strength to rely on and how to leap. We should do more publicity to make it deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

To achieve "emphasizing the present, de-emphasizing the past, and learning while doing," there is a lot of specific work to be done, such as formulating plans, training cadres, and organizing forces. Here, I think there are two points that need to be emphasized. One point is that philosophy and social science workers should continue to carry out self-ideological transformation to achieve a great leap forward in thinking. In recent years, the political ideology of most social science workers has been continuously improved, but compared with the rapidly advancing national construction, some people's thinking is still far behind. The question of who scientific research should serve has not been seriously resolved in the minds of these people. They say they serve the people, but in action, they serve their own fame and fortune. When arranging work, people with professional knowledge emphasize the need to take care of personal interests, while young people first require that they be trained as some kind of expert. The needs of the country, the principle of combining personal expertise and personal interests with the needs of the country, are often overlooked. In them, the contradiction between the individual and the collective is great. In research work, many large-scale tasks must rely on collective strength to be completed. Therefore, the contradiction between individualism and the collective is a stumbling block to the leap forward. To achieve a great leap forward, we must oppose this corrupt idea of putting personal fame, fortune, and interests first, and strive to make our thinking keep up with the objective situation. Research work, like other work, has its own characteristics. The kind of one-sided emphasis on characteristics, sticking to conventions, and conservative ideas are also obstacles to the great leap forward. In terms of work methods, we must use a fresh, lively, and creative spirit to replace backward and conservative thinking.

Another point that needs to be emphasized is the issue of study style. "Emphasizing the present, de-emphasizing the past" is the direction of research, and also the style of study. In the past, it seemed that there was a trend that researchers themselves would always mention the Three Dynasties, and others would think that only those who could find a few uncommon materials from thread-bound books were knowledgeable and experts. The lack of vitality in the current philosophical and social science research is closely related to this trend. There is an old saying: knowing the past but not the present is called sinking. Many people have "sunk," so where does the vitality come from? As far as history is concerned, some historians today may not truly recognize the history of the last hundred years, especially the history since the May Fourth Movement, and the history of the People's Republic of China as objects of scientific research. According to their point of view, those who engage in modern and contemporary history are merely engaging in politics and cannot be said to be engaged in scientific research. In fact, there has never been a history that is unrelated to politics, and none of the historical works of the past and present do not reflect the political views of the time. History books are political textbooks. People who hold this view are superficially emphasizing science, but actually want to escape from the reality of politics, and are expressing their lack of ability to scientifically understand modern history. I work in the Third Research Department of the Institute of History. The division of labor in the Third Institute of History is to study modern and contemporary Chinese history. We welcome everyone to participate in research in this area and promote a great leap forward in the study of modern and contemporary history. There are many people in academia who work diligently, but there are also people who are not so energetic and are unwilling to study hard. Now, workers and peasants on all production fronts have put forward heroic slogans to work hard for several years to change the face of production. We need a study style of arduous labor, and we need the same revolutionary spirit as workers and peasants.

With the correct direction, improved ideological understanding, coupled with drive, we will surely jump high and leap far.

    提倡艰苦劳动的学风
    刘大年
    哲学社会科学大跃进，我以为首先要坚决贯彻陈伯达同志倡议的“厚今薄古、边干边学”。这个倡议指明了从什么地方跃起和跃向何处的问题，也指出了依靠什么力量和如何跃法的问题。应该多作些宣传，使之深入人心。
    要做到“厚今薄古、边干边学”，有很多具体工作要做，例如制订规划，培养干部，组织力量等等都是。这里我认为有两点需要强调一下。一点是哲学社会科学工作者应该继续进行自我思想改造，来个思想大跃进。近几年来，多数社会科学工作者的政治思想不断有所提高，但是同飞跃前进的国家建设事业相比，有些人的思想还是远远落后的。科学研究到底为谁服务的问题，在这些人思想上没有认真解决。口头上是为人民服务，行动上是为自己的名利服务。安排工作时，有专业知识的人强调要照顾个人兴趣，青年人则首先要求把自己培养成某种专家。国家的需要，个人专长、个人兴趣同国家需要相结合的原则，往往被忽视。在他们身上，个人同集体的矛盾很大。在研究工作中，许多规模较大的工作，必须依靠集体力量才能完成。所以，个人主义同集体的矛盾是跃进的绊脚石。要大跃进，就必须反掉这种把个人名利、兴趣摆在第一位的腐朽思想，努力使自己的思想赶上客观形势。研究工作同其他工作一样，各有特点。那种片面强调特点、墨守陈规、保守不前的想法，也是大跃进的障碍。在工作方法上，要用新鲜活泼的、创造的精神，来代替落后、保守的思想。
    再一点，需要强调一下学风问题。“厚今薄古”是研究方向，也是学风。过去好像有一种风气，在研究者本人是言必称三代，别人也以为只有那些能从线装书上找出几条不常见的材料的人，才是有学问，是专家。目前哲学社会科学研究中的生气不足，同这种风气是密切相关的。前人有句话：知古不知今，是谓陆沉。很多人都“陆沉”了，生气从何来呢？就历史这门科学说，今天有些历史学家未必真正承认近百年史，特别是五四运动以来的历史，中华人民共和国历史是科学研究的对象。照他们的观点看来，搞近代、现代史的人，不过是在搞政治，说不上是在研究科学。其实从来没有同政治无关的历史，古往今来的历史著作，没有一本是不反映当时的政治观点的。历史书本是政治教科书。持有这种观点的人，表面上是重视科学，实际上是想逃避现实政治，并且是表示他们缺少科学地理解现代历史的能力。我是在历史研究所第三所工作的。历史三所的分工是研究中国近代现代史。我们欢迎大家来参加这方面的研究工作，促成近代现代史研究的大跃进。学术界有许多人勤勤恳恳工作，但是也有人不那么振作，不肯刻苦钻研。现在，各个生产战线上的工人农民都提出了豪迈的口号，要苦战若干年，改变生产的面貌。我们需要有刻苦劳动的学风，需要有工人农民那样的革命干劲。
    有了正确方向，思想认识提高了，再加上干劲，我们就一定会跳得高，跃得远。
