The day Comrade Yanqiu entered Beijing Hospital, we had been closely monitoring his condition. The doctors said Comrade Yanqiu was suffering from myocardial infarction and acute pneumonia. The hospital was making great efforts to treat him, but his condition was serious.

On the afternoon of March 9th, Jiang Xinrong and I went to visit him. Comrade Yanqiu seemed to be in good spirits. Although he had been in bed for a few days, he was still as talkative and humorous as usual. As soon as we met, he said humorously:

"Outside, everyone is vigorously advancing, which is so interesting! Look at me, people are making great leaps forward, but I am making a great leap into bed!"

His words showed great anxiety. We advised him to rest peacefully and he would soon recover. He smiled and said:

"The hospital is taking excellent care of me, and the doctors are very responsible! But they always 'keep secret' about my condition, and the nurses don't tell me the temperature when they take it, just saying 'It's getting better, the fever is down.' In a few days, I will be able to leap forward with everyone; I have talked to the doctor, and if I can manage to be discharged from the hospital within half a month, it won't delay my mission abroad!"

We quickly changed the subject, advising him not to talk, just to listen to us. He smiled and said, "Okay, I'll listen." As he spoke, he shifted his pillow and half-closed his eyes.

We signaled to each other, and were about to get up to say goodbye, when he suddenly laughed heartily and said:

"You won't let me talk, but you don't talk either; look at the news in today's newspaper that the Beijing Opera House is going to perform 'The White-Haired Girl,' that's great! This kind of subject matter can be performed by Peking Opera, which not only allows for some artistic experimentation, but more importantly, Peking Opera should really sweep away its staleness and open up new horizons! Why can't Peking Opera both perform 'The Gathering of Heroes' and 'The White-Haired Girl'? It's great to enhance the expressive power of a genre like that! It's like a cadre who can fight, work, talk theory, write articles, and understand foreign languages, what's wrong with having a few more skills! I'm old, but if I were twenty years younger, I'd definitely play the White-Haired Girl!" This triggered another burst of laughter.

We stood up, and he kept saying, "Talk a little longer!"

"Have your rural performance teams returned! This trend of physical labor is excellent! In the old society, labor was looked down upon, but now everyone is scrambling to labor, it's really interesting! These days, the doctors and nurses in the hospital are also participating in voluntary labor—digging rivers, working with real gusto. Yesterday, a nurse who participated in labor accidentally had her hand injured by a reckless young man, but it doesn't matter, the nurse can apply medicine herself."

He then humorously instructed Jiang Xinrong:

"When you participate in labor, you have to be careful to stay away from reckless young men!"

The nurse came in to serve dinner, and we shook hands with him to say goodbye as usual, and asked him as usual if he wanted anything to eat. He said:

"The hospital is taking good care of me. Everyone is very busy, so don't come to see me too often. -- Please bring me some green olives next time."

"Okay, we'll bring them tomorrow!"

We left the hospital at 5:50 PM.

On the way home, we were filled with joy. Comrade Yanqiu was in such good spirits that he might be discharged from the hospital in half a month.

After dinner, around 8:10 PM, we suddenly received a call from the hospital: Comrade Yanqiu was critically ill and was being vigorously rescued!

Comrades Zhang Geng and I rushed to the hospital, and the doctor told us with deep sorrow: "Comrade Cheng Yanqiu suddenly fell ill at 8:00 PM, and after emergency treatment failed, his heart has now stopped beating!"

We were stunned as if struck by lightning. Comrade Yanqiu's heart had really stopped beating! Had he really passed away suddenly! I almost suspected it was a dream! His voice and smile from two hours earlier, so vivid in my mind, how could he be dead! But the disease took his life, this is an ironclad fact, he has indeed bid us farewell forever! At 5:50 PM, who would have thought that a goodbye would be a farewell forever!

Comrade Yanqiu, you have not bid farewell to us forever, we will always remember you. Your death is a great loss to the people's art cause. Your artistic achievements have left an immortal treasure in the motherland's art treasury. You will always live in the hearts of the people. In art, you have reached the peak of perfection through hard work, courageous research, and innovation; in politics, due to your humble origins and close ties with the working masses, you were upright, unyielding, and pursued the truth, finally embarking on the path of communism. Comrade Yanqiu, your life was a life of labor, a life of integrity, a life of purity, a life of an outstanding artist of the people, a life worthy of the Party's magnificent cause! Beloved Comrade Yanqiu, in haste, I don't have time to write in detail about your life and contributions. I can only record the moment of our last farewell with tears. May you rest in peace! We will certainly advance bravely and make greater leaps forward for the Party's art cause, to realize your unfinished aspirations!

    永别的时刻
    马少波
    从砚秋同志进北京医院那天起，我们一直在密切注意着他的病情。医生说砚秋同志患的是心肌栓塞症和急肺炎，医院正在以极大努力进行治疗，但是病情是严重的。
    3月9日的下午，我和江新蓉同去探病。砚秋同志的精神看来很好，虽然卧床几天了，仍是像平常一样的谈笑风生，一见面他就幽默的说道：
    “外面一股劲儿大跃进，多有意思！瞧我，人家大跃进，我倒大卧床了！”
    言下十分焦急，我们劝他安心静养，很快便可以恢复健康的。他微笑着说：
    “医院对我照顾的好极了，大夫非常负责！可是病情究竟怎样老向我‘保密’，护士试表也不告诉度数，只是说‘见好些，热退了’。过几天，我也能够和大家一同跃进就好了；我和大夫谈过，假如我能争取在半个月内出院，还误不了我的出国任务呢！”
    我们连忙把话岔开，劝他不要说话，只听我们说好了，他笑着说：“好，听话”。一面说，一面移了移枕头，微合着眼睛。
    我们相互示意一下，正要起身告辞，他忽然爽朗地笑起来，说道：
    “不让我说话，可你们也不说；看今天报纸的消息京剧院要演‘白毛女’，太好了！这种题材，京剧完全可以演，这样不但艺术上可以作些实验，更重要的是京剧真是应该扫扫暮气，开开新生面了！京剧为什么不可以使他又能演群英会，又能演白毛女呢？这样增强一个剧种的表现力，多好！好像一个干部，又能打仗，又能作工，又能讲理论，又能写文章，又懂外国文，多几样本事有什么不好呢！我是年纪大了，若是退回二十年，我准演白毛女！”又引起一阵笑声。
    我们站起身来，他一再说：“再少谈一会儿！”
    “你们的下乡演出队回来了么！现在劳动锻炼这个风气好极了！旧社会轻视劳动，现在大家都抢着劳动，真有意思！这几天医院里大夫护士们也有人去参加义务劳动——挖河，干的真带劲。昨天有一位护士参加劳动叫楞小伙子不小心把手碰伤了，不过，不要紧，护士自己会上药”。
    他接着幽默地叮咛江新蓉：
    “你参加劳动的时候，可得留神，要离楞小伙子远一些！”
    护士进来要开饭了，我们像平常一样地向他握手告辞，像平常一样地问他要不要什么吃的东西。他说：
    “医院照顾的很周到。大家很忙，不必常来看我。——再来请您带几个青果（橄榄）来吧。”
    “好，明天带来！”
    我们离开医院的时候，是五点五十分。
    回家的路上，满心欢喜，砚秋同志的兴致这样好，说不定半个月就可以出院了。
    晚饭后，约在八点十分钟，突然接到医院的电话通知：砚秋同志病危，正在大力急救！
    我和张庚同志等急忙赶到医院，医生沉痛地告诉我们：“程砚秋同志在下午八时突然病发，急救不治，现在心脏已经停止跳动了！”
    我们像受到迅雷一击，怔住了。砚秋同志真的心脏停止跳动了么！真的溘然长逝了么！我几乎怀疑是在梦中！两小时前的声音笑貌，栩栩在目，那里会是死了呢！但是病魔夺去了他的生命，这是铁一般的事实，他确确实实和我们永别了！五点五十分，谁料一别成永别！
    砚秋同志，你并没有和我们永别，我们将永远记忆着你。你的逝世，是人民艺术事业的重大损失，你的艺术成就，在祖国的艺术宝库中留下了不朽的财富，你将永远活在人们的心里。你在艺术上由于刻苦钻研、勇于创造革新，早已达到登峰造极的境界；在政治上由于贫寒出身、和劳苦群众有密切联系，刚直不屈，追求真理，终于走上了共产主义的道路。砚秋同志，你的一生，是劳动的一生、正直的一生、是光洁的一生，是人民的优秀的艺术家的一生，是无愧于党的壮丽事业的一生！敬爱的砚秋同志，仓卒间我来不及细写出你的生平和贡献，我只能洒泪记下和你最后一别的时刻，愿你安息！我们一定为了党的艺术事业，为实现你的未竟的志愿，奋勇跃进，再跃进！
