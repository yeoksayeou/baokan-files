    Resolving the Contradiction Between One Good and Two Not-So-Goods

    Currently, the income of many handicraft cooperative members is relatively high, not only higher than the income of local farmers, but also higher than the income of workers in local large factories of comparable size, appearing like a crane standing among chickens, very conspicuous. Is high income good or not? It's both good and not good. High income and a more prosperous life are good. However, if individual income is too high, the cooperative's accumulation will be correspondingly reduced, and production development will be correspondingly slower, which is not good in the long run. If the income of cooperative members is much higher than that of farmers and workers in large factories, it will be detrimental to the unity of the people, and from an overall perspective, this is also not good.

    How to resolve the contradiction between one "good" and two "not-so-goods"? The practices of some handicraft cooperative members in Wuhan and Anhui are worth promoting. After discussion, they no longer distribute profits based on labor and voluntarily invest their surplus money into the cooperative to expand the cooperative's reproduction.

    解决一好与两不好的矛盾
    现在，不少手工业合作社社员的收入都偏高，不仅高于当地农民的收入，而且高于当地规模相当的大工厂的工人收入，好像鹤立鸡群一般，很突出。收入过高好不好呢？又好又不好。收入高，生活富裕些，这是好。但是，个人收入太多了，合作社的积累就会相应地减少，生产发展就相应地慢，从长远来看，这就不好。社员收入比农民和大工厂的工人的收入高得太多，就不利于人民内部的团结，从全局来看，这也不好。
    怎样解决一个“好”和两个“不好”的矛盾呢？武汉和安徽的一些手工业社社员的做法值得提倡，他们经过讨论以后，不再劳动分红，并且自动把多余的钱投入合作社，用以扩大合作社的再生产。
