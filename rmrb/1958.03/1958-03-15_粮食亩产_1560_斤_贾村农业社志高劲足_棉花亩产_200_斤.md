Grain Yield of 1560 Jin Per Mu
    Jia Village Agricultural Cooperative Full of Aspiration
    Cotton Yield of 200 Jin Per Mu
    This newspaper reports that the broad masses of members of the Jia Village Agricultural Cooperative in Luancheng County, Hebei Province, which achieved a large increase in grain production while planting a large amount of cotton, are full of energy and are striving to achieve a yield of 1,560 jin of grain per mu and 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. Before the Spring Festival, the cooperative's manure had all been delivered to the fields, the winter wheat had been irrigated twice, and the farm implements had been repaired and equipped.
    This cooperative is located fifteen miles southwest of Shijiazhuang. Cotton fields account for 60% of the cultivated land area, and grain has always been insufficient for self-sufficiency. In 1955, the village was supplied with more than 90,000 jin of grain by the state. However, in the two years since the realization of cooperation, production has developed unprecedentedly. In 1956, although it suffered a once-in-a-century flood, the average yield per mu of 2,056 mu of grain crops in the village was 668 jin. Since then, the cooperative has leaped from a grain-deficient cooperative to a grain-surplus cooperative, and sold more than 62,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. In 1957, all crops achieved another bumper harvest, with an average grain yield of 818 jin per mu and a surplus of 600,000 jin; the cotton yield was 105 and a half jin of ginned cotton per mu, 78 jin higher than in 1956. The average net income per person in the cooperative reached 101 yuan.
    This year, the cooperative will adopt methods such as intercropping and interplanting, and increasing the planting of high-yield crops, so that the 2,330 mu of grain crops will produce 1,560 jin per mu, and 2,073 mu of cotton will be planted, producing 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    粮食亩产1560斤
    贾村农业社志高劲足
    棉花亩产200斤
    本报讯　河北栾城县以大量种植棉花同时获得粮食大增产的贾村农业社，广大社员干劲十足，正为今年争取亩产粮食一千五百六十斤，亩产皮棉二百斤而奋斗。早在春节以前，这个社的粪已全部送到地里，冬麦已灌水两次，农具已修配齐备。
    这个社在石家庄市西南十五里。棉田面积占耕地面积60％，一向粮食不能自给，1955年全村由国家供给粮食九万多斤。但是，实现了合作化的两年间，生产空前发展。1956年，虽然遭受了百年不遇的大水灾，但全村二千零五十六亩粮食作物，平均每亩产量六百六十八斤，这个社从此由缺粮社一跃而成为余粮社，并卖给国家六万二千多斤余粮。1957年各项作物又获得大丰收，粮食平均亩产达八百一十八斤，余粮六十万斤；棉花亩产皮棉一百零五斤半，比1956年高七十八斤。全社每人纯收入平均达一百零一元。
    今年，这个社将采取间作套种，增种高产作物等办法，使二千三百三十亩粮食作物亩产一千五百六十斤，棉花种植二千零七十三亩，亩产皮棉二百斤。
