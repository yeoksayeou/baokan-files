Thirty-Six Local Construction Enterprises Propose Launching a Competition to Transform the Face of Construction Enterprises Through a Year of Hard Work

    (Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Construction Engineering recently convened a production leap forward conference for local construction enterprises in Beijing. Representatives from thirty-six local construction enterprises, including the Shanghai First Construction Engineering Company, jointly proposed to construction enterprises nationwide: Launch a broad, deep, and sustained socialist revolution competition among enterprises.

    The proposal put forward common leap forward targets for these thirty-six enterprises: First, guarantee the completion of all construction engineering tasks assigned by the central and local governments, as well as those entrusted by the people. The labor productivity of civil engineering companies (excluding water, electricity, heating, and sanitation installation, but including processing plants) will increase by more than 45% compared to 1957. Moreover, strive to complete all projects ahead of schedule, ensuring the early realization of national investment benefits. Second, resolutely eliminate structural major engineering quality accidents, ensure that first-class products reach 95% or more, eliminate third-class products, and keep the rework rate below 0.01%. Third, based on the budget quotas and indirect cost charging standards issued by the state in 1957, reduce project costs by more than 20% (excluding the 2.5% statutory profit). Fourth, resolutely eliminate deaths and major industrial injuries, and vigorously reduce general minor injuries.

    The proposal concluded by saying that our slogan is: Work hard for a year, eliminate backward phenomena, fundamentally change the face of construction enterprises, and bravely advance to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland!

    三十六个地方建筑企业倡议开展竞赛
    苦干一年革新建筑企业的面貌
    本报讯　建筑工程部日前在北京召开了地方建筑企业生产跃进会议。出席会议的上海市第一建筑工程公司等三十六个地方建筑企业的代表，联名向全国建筑企业提出倡议：展开一个广泛、深入、持久的同企业之间的社会主义革命大竞赛。
    倡议书中提出了这三十六个企业共同的跃进指标。一、保证完成中央和地方下达的以及人民群众所委托的各项建筑工程任务。土建公司（不包括水电暖卫安装，包括加工厂）的劳动生产率比1957年提高45％以上。并且力争所有的工程提前交工，保证及早发挥国家投资效果。二、坚决消灭结构性的重大工程质量事故，保证一级品达到95％以上，消灭三级品，返工率不超过0.01％。三、在1957年国家颁发的预算定额及间接费取费标准的基础上，降低工程成本20％以上（不包括2.5％法定利润）。四、坚决消灭死亡和重大工伤事故，大力减少一般性的轻伤事故。
    倡议书最后说，我们的口号是：苦干一年，消除落后现象，根本改变建筑企业的面貌，为加速祖国的社会主义建设而奋勇前进！
