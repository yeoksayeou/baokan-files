Preventing Late Frost from Harming Wheat

Since the beginning of spring, wheat seedlings have been growing well in various regions. Currently, the most important aspect of wheat production is preventing damage from late frost, and urgently carrying out watering and topdressing to ensure a bumper wheat harvest.

According to the characteristics of China's climate, wheat-producing areas north of the Huai River and south of the Great Wall often experience late frosts from around "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day) to around April 25th each year. At this time, wheat is in the jointing and heading stage, and its resistance to cold decreases. When frost occurs, it often causes large-scale death of wheat seedlings. A major frost in 1953 damaged tens of millions of acres of wheat. The experience of wheat frost damage in Huaibei and North China in 1953 and 1954 tells us that the most fundamental way to prevent and reduce frost damage is to strengthen spring field management of wheat, make the seedlings grow strong, and enhance their ability to resist low temperatures.

Timely watering is an important measure to prevent frost damage. According to the experience of the masses, watering one or two days before a frost occurs has the effect of maintaining ground temperature, moderating local temperature changes, and reducing damage. Therefore, agricultural production leading departments and agricultural cooperatives must pay attention to climate changes at all times and organize the masses to water for frost prevention in a timely manner.

After a frost, if it is found that wheat seedlings have been damaged, rescue measures should be taken immediately, and they must not be cut or plowed away. Although the above-ground parts of wheat die after frost damage, the underground tillering nodes can still re-tiller, head, and bear grain. For frost-damaged wheat fields, watering and topdressing should be carried out in a timely manner. If there is a lack of water and fertilizer at this time, not only will the number of new tillers decrease, but they may even die midway. The rescue of frost-damaged wheat fields should be done as early as possible. According to a survey by the agricultural department of Qianxuecheng County, Shandong, the land where 12 catties of ammonium sulfate and 4 catties of bean cake were applied before the frost damage could increase production by 81.1% per mu; applying 2,000 catties of soil manure ten days after the frost damage increased production by 50%; and applying 700 catties of soil manure and 10 catties of bean cake twenty days after the frost damage increased production by 10.5%. This survey shows that watering and topdressing should be done as early as possible.

Strengthening wheat field management at the present time can not only prevent frost damage, but also increase the unit yield of wheat and strive for a greater bumper wheat harvest this year. It is hoped that every agricultural cooperative will seize the opportunity to carry out this win-win situation.

    防止晚霜为害小麦
    入春以来，各地麦苗生长良好。当前小麦生产上最重要的是防止晚霜为害，抓紧浇水，追肥，保证小麦丰收。
    根据我国气候特点，淮河以北和长城以南的麦产区，每年“清明”前后到4月25日左右，常有晚霜发生。这时小麦正处在拔节抽穗阶段，抗寒力减退，遇到霜冻，往往造成麦苗大批死亡。1953年一场大霜就冻坏了几千万亩小麦。1953、1954两年淮北和华北地区小麦霜害经验告诉我们，防止和减轻霜害的最根本办法就是加强小麦春季田间管理，使麦苗生长健壮，增强抵抗低温的能力。
    及时浇水是防止霜冻的一个重要措施。根据群众的经验，在霜冻发生前一、二天浇水，具有保持地温，缓和局部温度变化，减轻受害的作用。因此，农业生产领导部门和农业社都必须时刻注意气候的变化，及时组织群众浇水防冻。
    霜冻以后，若发现麦苗受害，应该立即进行抢救，千万不要割掉或犁掉。小麦受霜后地面部分虽然死亡，但地下的分蘖节仍然可以从新分蘖和抽穗结实。对受害的麦田，要适时地浇水、追肥。这时如果缺水少肥，不仅新生分蘖数目减少，甚至会中途死亡。对受冻麦田的抢救，越早越好。据山东前薛城县农业部门调查，霜害发生前施硫铵十二斤，豆饼四斤的地每亩可增产81.1％；受冻后十天施土粪二千斤的，增产50％；受冻后二十天施土粪七百斤，豆饼十斤的，增产10.5％。这个调查说明，无论浇水，追肥，都要争取早搞。
    在当前加强小麦田间管理不仅可以防止霜冻灾害，而且可以提高小麦单位产量，争取今年小麦更大的丰收。这种一举两得的事情，希望每个农业社都要抓紧进行。
