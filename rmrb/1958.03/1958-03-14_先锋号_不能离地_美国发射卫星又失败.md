    "Vanguard" Cannot Leave the Ground
    Another Satellite Launch Failure for the United States

    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Washington News: The United States suffered another failure in launching an artificial satellite on the 12th.

    The U.S. Department of Defense originally planned to launch an artificial satellite with a "Vanguard" rocket at the Cape Canaveral test site in Florida on the 12th. Due to technical failures, the launch was postponed for several hours and still could not be initiated. At the same time, the rocket's liquid oxygen fuel was about to explode due to rising temperature, and the authorities in charge had to announce the suspension of the test.

    “先锋号”不能离地
    美国发射卫星又失败
    据新华社13日讯  华盛顿消息：美国12日发射人造卫星又一次遭到失败。
    美国国防部原定12日在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角试验场用“先锋式”火箭发射一枚人造卫星。由于技术故障，推延了几个钟头还不能发出，同时，火箭的燃料液体氧因温度上升而行将爆炸，负责当局不得不宣布停止试验。
