　　Visiting Every Plot, Evaluating Every Plot
　　Jingjiang Inspection Team Becomes Production Promotion Team

　　(Our Report) The Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province, organized a spring production campaign inspection team of more than 900 people to conduct a comprehensive production inspection throughout the county, mainly focusing on wheat field management and preparations for spring plowing. The inspection team visited fields and threshing grounds, mobilizing every household and rapidly guiding the great production campaign towards a deeper, more detailed, and more solid direction. The masses call this inspection team a promotion team.

　　The four inspection subgroups of Jingjiang County were "commanded" by the county party secretary, with commune cadres and some experienced old farmers also participating in the inspection, visits, and comparisons on the spot. The slogan they put forward was: "Comprehensive inspection, visiting every plot, evaluating every plot." When the inspection team arrived at a commune, they divided into field groups and threshing ground groups. The field groups visited every field, checking the field management of the three wheat crops, looking at fertilization, weeding, irrigation, and greening. The threshing ground groups visited every household, looking at cattle sheds, pig pens, manure tanks, ponds, and the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests. They aimed to "examine every plot, scrutinize every place." Wherever the inspection team went, it ensured "four sides" and "four on-the-spots." The "four sides" were inspecting, evaluating, proposing measures, and taking action simultaneously; the "four on-the-spots" were discovering problems on the spot, discussing solutions with local cadres and masses on the spot, commending on the spot, and criticizing on the spot. They also used methods such as broadcasting, big-character posters, blackboards, and inserting signs to commend the advanced, criticize the backward, and exchange experiences.

　　Through this inspection, the county party committee gained a relatively clear understanding of the county's production, especially the management of the three wheat crops, and proposed positive measures. First-class wheat fields accounted for 50%, second-class wheat fields accounted for 40%, and third-class wheat fields accounted for 10%. The county party committee proposed "High-yield fields should strive for even higher yields, low-yield fields should catch up with high-yield fields, and third-class fields should be eliminated"; it demanded that concentrated efforts be made to apply all fertilizers to the fields before the vernal equinox. Corresponding measures were also proposed for preparations for spring plowing and other tasks. (Xinhua News Agency Special)

    块块跑到　块块鉴定
    靖江检查团成为生产促进团
    本报讯　江苏靖江县组织九百多人的春季生产运动检查团，在全县范围内，进行一次以麦田管理和备耕为主要内容的生产大检查。检查团跑遍田头、场头，带动家家户户，把大生产运动迅速地引向更深、更细、更扎实的方向发展。群众称这个检查团为促进团。
    靖江县的四个检查分团，由县委书记“挂帅”，社干部和一部分老农也就地参加检查、参观、评比。他们提出的口号是：“全面检查，块块跑到，块块鉴定”。检查团到了社里，又分成田头组和场头组。田头组跑遍了每一块田，查看三麦的田间管理，看施肥，看锄草，看水利，看绿化。场头组跑遍了每家每户，看牛房，看猪圈，看粪缸，看池塘，看以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。做到“块块过目，处处过目”。检查团到那里，那里就做到“四边”和“四就”。“四边”是边检查，边鉴定，边提措施，边行动；“四就”是就地发现问题，就地和当地干群商量解决，就地表扬，就地批评。并且还运用了广播、大字报、黑板报、插牌子等方式，表扬先进，批评落后，交流经验。
    通过这次检查，县委比较清楚地了解了全县生产特别是三麦田间管理情况，并且提出了积极的措施。全县一类麦田有50％，二类麦田有40％ ，三类麦田有10％。县委提出了“高产田争取更高产，低产田赶上高产田，消灭三类田”；要求集中力量把一切肥料在春分以前施到田里去。对于备耕等工作也提出了相应的措施。　（新华社专稿）
