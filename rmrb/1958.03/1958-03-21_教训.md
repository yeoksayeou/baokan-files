    The No. 2 blast furnace of the Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant in Zhejiang Province was forced to shut down on the twenty-second day after it was built and began producing iron because a large "tumor" grew inside the furnace. This news was announced by Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a provincial party committee meeting on January 27. Based on this accident, he repeatedly warned all the cadres present that when actively developing local industry, they should be extremely cautious and humble, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, use scientific methods to manage industry and study technology, and not be negligent in the slightest, let alone complacent, paralyzed, or careless. He also hoped to carefully summarize the experiences and lessons learned from this accident as a reference for future local industrial construction.
    The Shaoxing Iron and Steel Plant has a total of four small blast furnaces, which can produce 40,000 tons of pig iron per year. The No. 1 blast furnace was built and began producing iron in November last year. Thanks to the assistance of experts, technicians, and skilled workers sent from Shanghai, Ma'anshan, and other places, it has been operating normally since it was ignited.
    The No. 2 blast furnace was built and ignited on December 31 last year, and the first furnace of iron was produced on New Year's Day this year. The test results showed that the iron quality was rated as "Special Grade," which was a very gratifying and happy event.
    However, at this time, the leading cadres and workers of the factory became complacent and paralyzed, thinking that they already had the experience of normal production from the No. 1 blast furnace, and nothing would be a problem. As a result, they did not strictly abide by the operating procedures and did not strengthen scientific management, turning minor problems into major problems and major problems into incurable diseases.
    First of all, after the first batch of molten iron was produced on the morning of New Year's Day, iron should have been tapped every two hours to prevent the new furnace from being damaged due to excessive pressure. This was common knowledge to protect the safety and longevity of the furnace. However, the leaders and workers of this factory did not do so. In order to produce more molten iron, they treated it like a normal blast furnace and scheduled iron tapping every four hours on the afternoon of New Year's Day. As a result, an accident occurred at 4:00 p.m. that day, and the molten iron in the furnace overflowed, burning out a slag outlet on the east side. The furnace was shut down for forty minutes to replace a new slag outlet. Due to the long-term shutdown, the quality of this furnace of iron plummeted by four grades, becoming grade four iron. Since then, the quality of the iron from the No. 2 blast furnace has never recovered. It was either grade two or grade three, and more often grade four, or even worse. Another reason for the burning of the east slag outlet was that the water watcher did not follow the regulations to measure the temperature of the blast furnace cooling water on time; if it had been measured on time and problems had been discovered in time, the slag outlet would not have been burned.
    Secondly, according to the person in charge of the factory, the iron ore particles were too large and not suitable for small blast furnaces to smelt iron. In addition, the crushed pieces and fines were poured into the furnace during charging, which made the ventilation in the furnace poor and the smelting difficult. This was also a reason for the formation of "tumors."
    In this way, the No. 2 blast furnace barely maintained operation until January 20. Subsequently, it encountered an accident in which the wire rope of the hoist broke. During the repair of the wire rope, the temperature at the top of the furnace rose sharply, and everyone was worried that the top of the furnace and the large and small material bells might be burned out. Therefore, after the wire rope was repaired, the foreman and technicians decided to pour two large carts of water into the furnace. They believed that these two carts of water would not have any impact on the smelting in the furnace. Who knew that it would have been better not to pour it? As soon as it was poured, the furnace made a loud noise, and all the slag outlets and iron outlets were blown open, with molten iron and fierce fire flying everywhere.
    In the last few days, the workers of the hot blast furnace also did not operate according to the procedures. They burned the internal temperature of the hot blast furnace four or fifty degrees higher than the standard temperature, exceeding the heat resistance capacity of the hot blast furnace itself, and thus burned out the hot air pipe. Because a lot of hot air leaked from the pipe cracks, the hot air volume, hot air temperature, and hot air pressure in the blast furnace all dropped below the standard.
    These factors of poor operation combined to cause the formation of "tumors" in the furnace.
    Originally, the formation of "tumors" in blast furnaces is a common phenomenon. As long as it is discovered early and emergency measures are taken immediately, it can be completely eliminated. However, after the leaders and workers of this factory discovered the "tumor" in the No. 2 blast furnace, they panicked. Some people said to increase the air volume, and others said to add more cold water. As a result, the latter measure was adopted to cool down the furnace. This chaotic approach caused the "tumor" to grow larger and larger, until the upper part of the furnace was also filled with "tumors." The added coke was stuck at the top of the furnace and could not reach the hearth, and the molten iron in the lower part gradually solidified and could not flow out because it did not get heat. By January 22, the "tumor" had grown to occupy more than four-fifths of the entire furnace space, leaving only a narrow flue. The blast furnace had to be shut down.
    The losses caused by this accident were naturally great. But the experiences and lessons learned are also rich. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    浙江省绍兴钢铁厂的二号高炉在建成炼铁后的第二十二天，因为炉内长了很大的“瘤子”而被迫停炉。这个消息是中共浙江省委第一书记江华在1月27日的省委会议上宣布的。他根据这件事故，一再告诫所有到会的干部，在积极发展地方工业的时候，应该万分谨慎虚心，戒骄戒躁，要用科学的方法来管理工业和钻研技术，不能有丝毫的疏忽，更不能自满麻痹、粗枝大叶。他还希望好好总结产生这一事故的经验教训，作为今后地方工业建设的借鉴。
    绍兴钢铁厂共有四座小高炉，能年产四万吨生铁。第一号高炉在去年11月建成炼铁，因为得到上海、马鞍山等地派来专家、技师和熟练工人的帮助，点火以后一直都很正常。
    第二号高炉在去年12月31日建成点火，今年元旦炼出第一炉铁。经化验的结果，铁质列入“特号”等级，是一件十分令人喜悦的快事。
    但是就在这时，厂的领导干部和职工产生了自满麻痹思想，以为已经有一号高炉正常生产的经验，什么都不成问题了。于是便不严格遵守操作规程，不加强科学管理，使小毛病变成大毛病，大毛病变成不治之症。
    首先，当元旦上午出了第一炉铁水以后，照理应该每隔两小时就出铁一次，使新炉不致因受压过大而烧坏，这原是保护炉子安全和长寿的常识。但是这个厂的领导人员和职工却不这样做，他们为了多出铁水，在元旦下午就把它当作一般高炉一样定为四小时出铁一次，结果就在那天下午四点钟发生了事故，炉内铁水满溢，把东边的一个出渣口烧坏了。为了换装一个新的出渣口，休风四十分钟。正由于长时休风的影响，这一炉铁的质量暴降了四级，成为四号铁。自那以后，二号高炉的铁的质量一直没有恢复，不是二号，就是三号，更多的是四号，甚至还有更差一等的。东渣口烧坏的另外一个原因，是看水工没有执行按时测量高炉冷却水温度的规定；如果按时加以测量，及时发现问题，渣口就不会烧坏。
    其次，据这个厂的负责人说，铁矿石的颗粒过大，不适合小型高炉炼铁的标准，加上进料时把碎块和细末都倒进了炉内，使炉内通风不良、熔冶困难，这也是结“瘤”的一个原因。
    就这样，二号高炉勉强维持到了1月20日。随后，又碰到卷扬机钢索崩断事故。在修理钢索的过程中，炉顶的温度大大升高，大家都很担心炉顶和大、小料钟可能烧坏，因此在钢索修好以后，工长和技术员便决定倒两大车水到炉子里去。他们认为，这两车水对炉内的冶炼是不会有什么影响的。谁知不倒犹罢，一倒下去，炉子轰一声巨响，所有出渣口和出铁口都被冲开，铁水同猛火四处飞扬。
    在最后的那几天中，热风炉的工人也没有按规程操作。他们把热风炉的内温烧得比标准温度高了四、五十度，越出了热风炉本身的设计耐热能力，因而把热风管烧坏了。由于热风从管缝中走漏了不少，使高炉内的热风量、热风温和热风压都降低到标准以下。
    这些操作不良的因素凑合起来，便造成了炉内结“瘤”。
    本来，高炉结“瘤”是常有的现象，只要发现得早，马上采取紧急措施处理，是完全可以消除的。但是，这个厂的领导和职工在发现二号高炉结“瘤”以后，却慌了手脚，有人说要增加风量，又有人说要多放冷水，结果采用了后一措施让炉降温。这种混乱的作法使“瘤子”越结越大，到最后连炉内的上部也结“瘤”了。加进去的焦炭在炉顶就被卡住到不了炉缸，下部的铁水因为得不到热而逐渐凝结，流不出来。到了1月22日，“瘤子”长大到占有全炉空间的五分之四以上，只剩下了窄窄的一条烟道。高炉不得不停炉了。
    这次事故所造成的损失自然是很大的。但是得到的经验教训也是丰富的。（本报特约稿）
