How to Handle Tens of Thousands of Opinions?
    Everyone Takes Action, Thoroughly Correcting
    Shanghai Universities Create Various Methods

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai universities and the Shanghai branches of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, during the "Double-Anti" movement, put up three million big-character posters in just a few days, covering the inside and outside of all teaching, office, laboratory, and dormitory buildings. Facing this forest and ocean of big-character posters, how could they promptly understand the main problems and opinions of each individual, and quickly and effectively carry out major rectification and improvements? Each unit created many mass-line working methods. After the great blooming and contending began, various universities quickly organized big-character poster exhibitions by department, mobilizing teachers, students, and staff to select newly emerging, high-quality, representative big-character posters every day, and display them in a concentrated manner according to the issues, for everyone to visit. The big-character posters in the exhibitions all had eye-catching headlines, and some even had "editor's notes." Big-character posters exposing and satirizing the "six airs" were also accompanied by cartoons, and big-character posters exposing waste were exhibited together with the actual wasted items.

    Scientific research institutes with fewer people adopted the method of organizing the masses to evaluate the big-character posters themselves, adding a paper five-star red flag to high-quality big-character posters to attract the attention of all personnel in the institute.

    Criticism between individuals was handled by delivering the opinions directly to the person involved. Big-character posters criticizing someone were posted on the door of their office or dormitory. Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and other schools posted public opinion solicitation pockets for each teacher, so anyone with opinions about them could write a big-character poster and put it in their pocket. Shanghai University of Political Science and Law placed a notebook next to each teacher's "red and expert" plan big-character poster, so the masses could directly write their opinions about the person or their plan in this notebook.

    In past rectifications, Shanghai universities always had the rectification office copy and organize big-character posters, compile them into volumes, and propose rectification opinions to be sent to various departments for discussion and research. In this way, the rectification of several thousand opinions could take several months. In this "Double-Anti" movement, all schools abandoned this approach of having only a few people take action, and implemented the instruction of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Handle tens of thousands of opinions in batches, everyone takes action, and correct them thoroughly," mobilizing all teachers, students, and staff to rectify the situation themselves. Following the high tide of great blooming and contending, a high tide of major rectification and improvement emerged. All teachers and students were organized into teaching and research groups or classes, and they themselves sorted out, analyzed, and summarized the various problems raised in the big-character posters in their units. After discussion, they proposed rectification opinions and sent them to the relevant departments or individuals for reference; they also discussed and studied the criticisms, problems, and rectification suggestions proposed to them by other units.

    Many schools also established self-organized shock brigades to go deep into various departments and units within the school to check whether the rectification work was dragging on or was not thorough.

    怎样处理上万意见？
    人人动手　改得彻底
    上海高等学校创造多种办法
    本报讯　上海各高等学校和中国科学院上海地区各研究所，在双反运动中几天就贴出了三百万张大字报，把所有的教学、办公、实验、宿舍大楼里里外外都贴满了。面对着大字报的森林和海洋，怎样才能及时了解主要问题和对各人的意见，迅速有效地大整大改呢？各单位创造了许多群众路线的工作方法。大鸣大放开始后，各高等学校很快就以系为单位举办了大字报展览会，发动师生员工每天挑选新出现的质量高、有代表性的大字报，按问题集中陈列出来，供大家参观。展览会上的大字报都加上了引人注目的大标题，有的还有“编者按语”，揭发和讽刺“六气”的大字报还附上漫画，揭发浪费的大字报和浪费的实物一道展览。
    人数较少的各科学研究所，采取了组织群众自己评比大字报的办法，在质量高的大字报上加上一个纸制的五星红旗，以唤起全所人员的注意。
    个人之间的批评意见，采取了送上门的做法。提谁的意见，大字报就贴到他的办公室或宿舍门口。上海财经学院等学校每个教师都贴出了公开征求意见的大字报口袋，谁对他有意见，就可以写大字报，放在他的口袋里。上海政法学院每位教师的红专规划大字报旁边都放了一本簿子，群众对他本人或他的规划有意见，就直接写在这本簿子上。
    在过去的整改中，上海高等学校都是由整风办公室抄录和整理大字报，汇编成册，提出整改意见发到各部门讨论，研究解决的。这样，几千条意见的整改要用上几个月。在这次的双反运动中，各校都抛弃了这种少数人动手的做法，执行中共上海市委的“上万意见，成批处理，人人动手，改得彻底”的指示，发动全体师生员工自己动手整改。紧接着大鸣大放高潮，出现了大整大改的高潮。所有的教师和学生都以教研组或班级为单位组织起来，自己整理、分析、归纳自己单位大字报中提出的各种问题，经过讨论提出整改的意见，送交各个有关部门或个人作参考；同时也讨论研究别的单位向他们提出的批评、问题和整改的建议。
    许多学校还成立了群众自己组织的突击队，深入到校内各部门各单位检查整改工作是否有拖拉和不彻底现象。
