In coal mine construction, the issue of mine size is not only an economic issue but also a political one. Addressing this issue requires embodying the principles of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and "building the country through diligence and frugality," while also adapting to objective natural conditions. During the First Five-Year Plan, due to a lack of experience, we did not sufficiently emphasize the relationship between mine size and investment, and between mine size and construction speed. It was only after 1956, when coal supply began to tighten and coal mine construction investment was somewhat restricted, that this important issue began to attract attention from all relevant parties.

Based on several years of construction experience, building large mines and small mines each generally has its own advantages and disadvantages.

In terms of the initial investment required per ton of coal designed capacity, building large mines requires higher technical standards, larger engineering volume, and more complex construction techniques, resulting in higher investment and longer construction time compared to small mines. The time to start producing coal and the time to reach designed capacity are also slower.

According to actual statistics from fifty-four mines, the results are as follows:

The Advantages and Disadvantages of Large and Small Mines

In terms of production efficiency and cost, according to statistics from the Ministry of Coal on existing producing mines, the all-employee efficiency of each type of mine is: large mines average 0.9386 tons per person per eight hours; medium mines average 0.84092 tons, which is 89.6% of large mines; small mines average 0.5632 tons, which is 60% of large mines.

In terms of production cost, according to statistics from the Ministry of Coal, the average cost per ton of coal for various types of mines under central state-owned coal mines nationwide in 1957 was as follows: large mines were 9.75 yuan, medium mines were 11.17 yuan, and small mines were 11.7 yuan.

In terms of the service life of mines, according to statistics from the Ministry of Coal on newly built mines during the First Five-Year Plan, the average service life of mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons was 58 years; 600,000-ton mines were 42 years; 450,000-ton mines were 44 years; 300,000-ton mines were 33 years; and mines with less than 300,000 tons were 18 years.

In terms of equipment supply, all equipment needed for medium and small mines can be manufactured and supplied domestically, but some important equipment needed for large mines still needs to be imported from abroad.

In summary, under normal circumstances, the advantages of large mines are: concentrated production, generally higher labor productivity, lower costs, and longer service life; the disadvantages are: higher initial investment per ton of designed capacity, longer construction period, and slower time to reach designed capacity. The advantages of small mines are: short construction period, quick coal production, easy to reach designed capacity, a positive effect on easing the tight coal supply situation, less initial investment per ton of production capacity, easy to solve equipment supply, and easier management; the disadvantages are: generally lower labor productivity, higher costs, and shorter service life. In short, from a general technical and economic comparison, large mines are superior in terms of low cost, high efficiency, and long-term prospects. However, from the perspective of current interests, in order to save initial investment and actively solve the coal shortage situation, small mines are more advantageous.

        Several Main Factors Determining Mine Size

Geological resource conditions are extremely important for determining mine size. Without buried coal reserves, mines of any size cannot be built. Other conditions such as hydrogeology and topography also have a significant impact on mine construction.

The coal geological resources in various regions of China are not the same. The coalfield conditions in North China are relatively favorable, especially in the Datong, Yangquan, and Luan areas of Shanxi, where reserves are very abundant; however, the topography of the mining area is relatively complex, and it is generally suitable for building large mines. The general characteristics of the southern provinces are complex geological structures, small coalfields, and thin and few coal seams, making them suitable for building small mines. In addition, the mining situation over the years also has a certain impact on the mine size. For example, in North China, many old mining areas were discovered earlier, and the shallow outcrops of coalfields have mostly been mined out. It is unreasonable to insist on building more small mines. However, in newly discovered or undeveloped virgin coalfields with relatively small inclinations, it is generally possible to build more small mines first.

Generally speaking, coalfields with deep and multiple coal seams, abundant reserves, and complex terrain are suitable for building more large mines; coalfields with complex geological structures, shallow and thin coal seams, and small reserves should build more small mines. However, this does not mean that geological resource conditions are the only determining factor in determining mine size. In addition to geological resource conditions, specific technical and economic comparisons must be made during mine construction, and factors such as the urgency of national coal demand and regional balance must be considered before determining mine size.

Adopting the method of technical and economic comparison is one of the main bases for determining mine size. Currently, there are two different economic comparison methods for dealing with the issue of mine size. One is: starting from one department, overly considering whether long-term development is economically reasonable. The conclusion drawn from this is often that large mines are more economically reasonable than small mines. If many mines are considered in this way, the result of the comparison should be to build more large mines and fewer small mines. The other is: starting from the development of the national economy as a whole, conducting a comprehensive economic comparison, and then drawing a conclusion about whether the mine size should be large or small. The former view has its own reasons. However, considering that China is currently still an economically backward country with insufficient construction funds, it is inappropriate to build more large mines. The latter approach may seem unreasonable from a local perspective, but it is the most reasonable from the perspective of national economic development. According to preliminary estimates, if the investment per ton of coal for medium and small mines is 3 yuan less than that of large mines, then building more medium and small mines than large mines during the Second Five-Year Plan will save 100 million yuan. With this investment, a 60,000-ton annual output ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant can be built. Using this fertilizer for cotton planting can increase cotton production by 100 million tons per year, which can weave 3.6 million bolts of cloth. These few links can accumulate 60 million yuan for the country each year (profits and taxes).

In addition, in the case of insufficient coal supply and less construction investment, it is necessary to consider how to find ways to produce more coal and produce coal quickly (of course, this cannot be separated from good and economical). This is a relationship between current and long-term interests. There are also two different solutions to this problem. One is: focusing on solving current needs and taking care of future rationality; the other is to focus on obeying future rationality and taking care of current coal supply. We should focus on producing more coal, producing coal quickly, and solving current needs, while appropriately taking care of future rationality. Because the construction of medium and small mines has the characteristics of quick coal production and low investment, it is more realistic to build more medium and small mines.

Of course, it is also not good to build too many small mines. For example, if we build small mines with a capacity of 50 million tons and a life span of 15 years due to the current coal shortage, these small mines will be scrapped after 15 years. At that time, we will not only need to build more mines to make up for these scrapped mines, but also the production capacity of coal mines must increase proportionally due to the development of the national economy, which will bring certain difficulties to the coal mine construction work. However, on the other hand, if we consider that hundreds or thousands of factories are forced to stop production due to lack of coal due to insufficient coal supply; or rural and urban residents cannot keep warm in winter due to insufficient fuel; or the development of agricultural production is hindered due to affecting the storage of feed and fertilizer, then it is not a matter of calculating the difference in investment between large and small mines, but rather a matter of calculating the huge losses caused by the damage to national economic development. At that time, it will not only be an economic issue, but also a political issue. At the same time, China is a country with not very abundant timber resources, but more than 10 million cubic meters of timber are used as fuel every year, so we must consider replacing it with coal. Therefore, striving to produce more coal and produce coal quickly is completely necessary.

Execution of the Policy of Combining Large, Medium, and Small Mines

According to China's coal resource situation, domestic equipment manufacturing capacity, and design technical standards, the Ministry of Coal stipulates that mines with a designed annual production capacity of 900,000 tons and above are classified as large mines; mines with 450,000 to 600,000 tons are classified as medium mines; and mines with 300,000 tons and below are classified as small mines.

According to the above classification, according to statistics from the Ministry of Coal, in 1957, there were 161 original mines under central state-owned coal mines, with an average mine size of 413,000 tons. Large mines accounted for 41.6%, medium mines accounted for 31.8%, and small mines accounted for 26.6%. If calculated according to the total national output in 1957, the output of small mines accounted for 38.5%, while the output of small mines in local state-owned coal mines accounted for 70% of the output of local state-owned coal mines.

During the First Five-Year Plan, 124 new mines were started under central state-owned coal mines. Calculated according to designed capacity, large mines accounted for 37.8%; medium mines accounted for 29.9%; and small mines accounted for 32.3%, with an average mine size of 420,900 tons. After preliminary analysis, the determination of the mine size of new mines during the First Five-Year Plan was reasonable, except for a few mines with shortcomings or errors that caused waste. However, in recent years, due to the increasing proportion of large mines, the average mine size of newly started mines in each year has gradually increased. This means that due to our lack of construction experience, the initial investment in construction has increased, and the growth of coal production has slowed down.

During the First Five-Year Plan, local state-owned coal mines started construction on a total of 94 new mines (excluding small coal kilns), with a designed capacity of 8.74 million tons, of which medium mines accounted for 31.6% and small mines accounted for 68.4%, with an average mine size of 93,000 tons.

We believe that while vigorously building a certain number of highly mechanized coal mines, we must also give full play to the enthusiasm of local governments, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives to run some small coal kilns with manual mining. This can not only give play to our country's advantageous conditions of abundant manpower and abundant resources, and appropriately increase a part of civil fuel; but also will have a good impact on increasing farmers' income and enlivening the rural economy. We must have the viewpoint of relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses. It is impossible to complete the serious task of developing the coal industry by relying solely on the central industrial departments concerned.

Since the State Council promulgated the instructions on developing small coal kilns on April 12, 1957, many regions have restored and rebuilt many small coal kilns, and have achieved great results. For example, according to incomplete statistics from Hunan Province, the number of small kilns in the province has developed to 3,000. This has played a great role in solving the local civilian coal problem, and because the small kilns are mostly excavated at the coal seam outcrops, they have not only not damaged resources, but also provided a lot of favorable information for exploring the coal seam conditions. In 1956, the small coal kilns run by handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan only produced 148,000 tons of coal throughout the year. In 1957, the annual output increased to 532,000 tons, an increase of more than four and a half times. After these small kilns were opened, because of their small scale, fewer people were employed, and the coal price was cheap, they were sold within a radius of thirty to fifty miles, and it was still convenient to carry them by people and animals. As a result, cooperatives increased accumulation, rural fuel needs were met, and farmers were very welcome. In 1958, Sichuan Province planned to increase the output of small kiln coal to 950,000 tons. Together with the output of central state-owned and local state-owned coal mines, this could basically meet the province's need for coal. This is the result of specifically implementing the construction policy of combining large, medium, and small mines.

How to Make Specific Arrangements During the Second Five-Year Plan?

In the current situation of economic backwardness and insufficient coal supply in our country, correctly implementing the policy of combining large, medium, and small mines in coal mine construction is of great significance.

After preliminary understanding, if planned according to the above policy, it is possible and necessary for central state-owned coal mines to build small mines accounting for about one-third of the total designed capacity during the Second Five-Year Plan in addition to building a certain number of large mines. The specific requirements for these mines should be: the general mine size should be less than 300,000 tons; the time to put into production should generally be within twelve to twenty months; the service life of the mine should generally be more than twenty years, and the technical equipment of the underground and surface production systems should be simplified as much as possible; industrial and civil buildings should adopt lower standards according to local conditions. Therefore, the investment per ton of coal should be around 20 yuan.

Local provincial coal mines should generally build mines with an annual output of less than 210,000 tons, except for medium-sized mines that can be built in mining areas with certain conditions; special county coal mines should build more mines with an annual output of less than 50,000 tons. In this way, excluding small coal kilns, the average mine size of local state-owned coal mines should be less than 150,000 tons, because building this type of small mine can not only reflect the superiority of local coal mines, but also is easier to solve in terms of geological design and construction requirements.

In areas with inconvenient transportation but with coal resources, according to local needs, the enthusiasm of handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives should be brought into play to lead the establishment of some small coal kilns for self-production, self-use, and self-sales to solve the supply of civil fuel locally.

    在煤矿建设中要贯彻执行大中小型相结合的方针
    何白沙
    在煤矿矿井建设中，井型问题不仅是个经济问题，而且是个政治问题。处理这个问题时要体现多快好省、勤俭建国的方针，又要适应客观的自然条件。在第一个五年计划期间，我们由于缺乏经验，对井型与投资之间、井型与建设速度之间的关系，没有足够的重视。1956年以后，煤炭供应开始紧张，煤矿建设投资又受到一定的限制，这个重要问题才开始引起各有关方面的重视。
    根据几年来的建设经验，建设大型矿井和小型矿井，在一般情况下都各有其优缺点。
    以每吨煤设计能力所需要的初期投资来看，建设大型矿井，由于技术标准要求较高、工程量大、施工技术比较复杂，投资要比小型井高，建设时间要长一些，开始出煤的时间以及达到设计能力的时间都比较慢。
    根据五十四个矿井的实际统计，其结果如下：
    大型矿井和小型矿井的优缺点
    从生产效率和成本来看，据煤炭部对现有生产矿井的统计，各类井型的全员效率为：大型井平均每人每八小时生产零点九三八六吨，中型井平均零点八四零九二吨，为大型井的89.6％；小型井平均零点五六三二吨，为大型井的60％。
    在生产成本方面，据煤炭部统计，1957年全国中央国营煤矿各类矿井的平均每吨成本如下：大型井为九点七五元，中型井为十一点一七元，小型井为十一点七元。
    从矿井的服务年限来看，据煤炭部对第一个五年计划期间新建矿井的统计，年产九十万吨的矿井平均服务年限为五十八年；六十万吨矿井为四十二年；四十五万吨矿井为四十四年；三十万吨矿井为三十三年；三十万吨以下的矿井为十八年。
    从设备供应方面来看：中小型矿井所需要的设备全部可由国内制造供应，但大型矿井所需要的一部分重要设备，还需要国外进口。
    综合以上情况来看，在一般情况下大型矿井的优点是：生产集中，劳动生产率一般较高，成本较低，服务年限长；缺点是：每吨设计能力的初期投资较高，施工期限较长，达到设计能力时间慢。小型矿井的优点是：建设期限短，出煤快，容易达到设计能力，对缓和煤炭供应的紧张局面有积极作用，每吨生产能力初期投资少，设备供应易于解决，管理也比较容易；缺点是：劳动生产率一般较低，成本较高，服务年限短。总之，从一般技术经济比较来看，如从成本低效率高长远情况来看，大型井就比较优越；如从当前利益出发，为节约初期投资、积极解决煤炭不足情况着想，则小型井就比较优越。
        决定井型的几个主要因素
    地质资源条件对确定井型有极其重要的意义。如果没有地质埋藏煤量，任何大小矿井都不能建设。其他如水文地形等各种条件，对建井也有重大的影响。
    我国各地区的煤炭地质资源不尽相同。华北地区煤田条件比较优越，尤其是山西的大同阳泉潞安一带，储量非常丰富；但矿区地形比较复杂，一般宜于建设大型矿井。南方各省的一般特点是地质构造比较复杂，煤田小，煤层少而薄，适宜建小型矿井。另外，历年来开采情况对井型也有一定影响。如：华北一带由于许多老矿区煤田发见的较早，煤田露头浅部多被挖掘一空，硬要建设更多的小型矿井是不合理的。但是在新发现的或者尚未开发的一些倾斜不大的处女煤田，一般可以先多建设一些小型矿井。
    一般说来，在煤层深、煤层多，储量丰富，地形又复杂的煤田，适于多建大型矿井；在地质构造复杂，煤层浅而薄，储量又不多的煤田应该多建小型矿井。但这并不意味着地质资源条件是确定井型的唯一的决定因素。除了地质资源条件以外，建井时还必须进行具体的技术经济比较，考虑国家需煤的缓急，地区平衡情况等因素，然后才能确定井型。
    采取技术经济比较的方法是确定井型的主要依据之一。目前对待井型问题有两种不同的经济比较方法。一种是：从一个部门出发，过高的考虑长远发展是否经济合理的问题。这样得出的结论，往往是大井比小井更为经济合理。如果对很多矿井都这样考虑，那末比较的结果，就应当多建大型井，少建小型井。另外一种是：从全国国民经济的发展出发，进行全面的经济比较，然后得出井型应大或小的结论。前一种看法，有它一定的理由。但是，如果考虑到我国当前还是一个经济落后的国家，建设资金还不够充裕，多建大型井就不适当。后一种作法，从局部来看也许有些不合理，但是从国民经济发展情况来看，则是最大的合理。根据初步估算，如按中小型井每吨煤投资比大型井少三元计算，则第二个五年计划期间，多建中小型井比多建大型井要节省一亿元。用这些投资可以建设一个年产六万吨的硫铵化肥厂，将这些化肥用于植棉，就可以每年增产棉花一亿吨，可织布三百六十万匹，这几个环节每年就可以为国家积累资金（利润和税收）六千万元。
    另外，在煤炭供应不足、建设投资又少的情况下，就有必要考虑如何设法多出煤快出煤的问题（当然这和好省是不能分割开来的）。这是一个当前和长远利益的关系问题。对这个问题也有两种不同的解决方法。一种是：以解决目前需要为主，照顾将来的合理性；另一种是以服从将来的合理为主，照顾目前煤炭的供应。我们应当以多出煤、快出煤、解决目前需要为主，同时适当照顾到将来的合理性。因为建设中小型矿井具有出煤快投资少的特点，因此多建中小型井就更有现实意义。
    当然，过多的建设小型矿井也不好。譬如，目前由于煤炭不足，如果多建五千万吨能力十五年寿命的小型矿井，则十五年后这些小井就要报废，那时我们不仅需要多建矿井来弥补这些报废的矿井，而且由于国民经济的发展，煤矿的生产能力也必须按照一定的比例递增，这就会给煤矿建设工作带来一定的困难。但是另一方面，如果我们考虑到由于煤炭供应不足而迫使几百或几千个工厂因缺乏煤炭而停止生产；或者由于燃料不足，城乡居民冬季不能取暖；或由于影响到饲料和肥料的储存而妨碍农业生产的发展，那时候就不是计算大井小井投资相差多少的问题，而是要计算国民经济发展受到破坏所引起的巨大损失了。那时就不仅是个经济问题，而成为一个政治性的问题了。同时，我国是个木材资源不很充裕的国家，但是每年用作燃料的木材要一千万立方公尺以上，这就不能不考虑用煤代替。因此，争取多出煤、快出煤是完全有必要的。大、中、小型井相结合方针的执行情况
    根据我国煤炭资源情况，国内设备制造能力，以及设计技术标准，煤炭部规定：设计年生产能力九十和九十万吨以上的矿井属于大型井；四十五到六十万吨的矿井属于中型井；三十和三十万吨以下的矿井属于小型井。
    按照以上划分，据煤炭部统计，1957年中央国营煤矿原有矿井一百六十一处，平均井型为41.3吨，大型井占41.6％，中型井占31.8％，小型井占26.6％。如果按1957年全国总产量计算，小型矿井的产量占38.5％，而地方国营煤矿中的小井产量占地方国营煤矿产量的70％。
    第一个五年计划期间，中央国营煤矿新开工矿井一百二十四处，按设计能力计算，大型井占37.8％；中型井占29.9％；小型井占32.3％，平均井型为四十二点零九万吨。经初步分析，对第一个五年计划期间新井井型的确定除少数矿井有缺点或错误因而造成浪费以外，绝大部分井型是合理的。但是几年来由于大型井能力所占的比重逐年增高，致使各年度新开工矿井的平均井型也逐渐增大。这意味着，由于我们缺乏建设经验，使建设初期投资多了些，煤炭产量的增长也就慢了些。
    地方国营煤矿在第一个五年计划期间，新开工矿井共九十四处（不包括小煤窑在内），设计能力八百七十四万吨，其中中型井占31.6％，小型井占68.4％，平均井型为九点三万吨。
    我们认为，在大力建设一定数量的机械化程度较高的煤矿的同时，还必须充分发挥地方政府以及手工业合作社和农业合作社的积极性，开办一些手工开采的小煤窑。这样做不仅能够发挥我国人力充足资源丰富的有利条件，适当地增加一部分民用燃料；而且对增加农民收入，活跃农村经济，将会产生良好的影响。我们必须具有依靠群众，发动群众的观点，只靠中央有关工业部门，是无法完成发展煤炭工业这一严重任务的。
    自国务院于1957年4月12日公布了关于发展小煤窑的指示以来，许多地区都恢复和新建了许多小煤窑，收到了很大的效果。例如，据湖南省不完全统计，全省现有小窑已发展到三千个。这对解决当地民用煤起了很大作用，并且因为小窑多在煤层露头开掘，不但没有破坏资源，而且对探清煤层状况提供了许多有利资料。四川在1956年时，手工业合作社和农业合作社营的小煤窑全年只生产煤十四万八千吨，1957年年产量便增长到五十三万二千吨，增加了四倍半。这些小窑开办以后，因为规模小，用人少，煤价便宜，在三、五十里以内销售，人担牲口驮也还方便。结果是：合作社增加了积累，农村需要的燃料得到了解决，农民非常欢迎。1958年四川省计划使小窑煤增产到九十五万吨，这样连同中央国营和地方国营煤矿的产量，就可以基本上满足全省对煤炭的需要。这就是具体贯彻大、中、小相结合的建设方针的结果。
  第二个五年计划期间怎样具体安排？
    在我国目前经济落后，煤炭供应不足的情况下，在煤矿矿井建设中，正确贯彻大、中、小型相结合的方针具有重大的意义。
    经过初步了解，如果根据以上方针来进行规划，在第二个五年计划期间，中央国营煤矿除建设一定数量的大型井以外，建设约占全部设计能力大约占三分之一的小型矿井是有可能的，也是必要的。对这些矿井的具体要求应该是：一般井型应在三十万吨以下；投入生产时间一般应在十二至二十个月以内；矿井服务年限一般应在二十年以上，井下和地面生产系统的技术装备应尽可能地简化；工业与民用建筑应因地制宜采取较低的标准。因此，每吨煤投资应在二十元左右。
    地方省营煤矿，除在具有一定条件的矿区内可以建设中型矿井以外，一般应建设年产二十一万吨以下的矿井；专县营煤矿则应多建设五万吨以下的矿井。这样，除小煤窑以外，地方国营煤矿的平均井型应在十五万吨以下，因为建设这种小型矿井不仅能体现地方煤矿的优越性，而且在地质设计施工的要求上，都比较容易解决。
    交通不便而又有煤炭资源的地区，根据当地需要情况，应该发挥手工业合作社及农业合作社的积极性，有领导地开办一些自产自用自销的小煤窑，以就地解决民用燃料的供应问题。（附图表）
