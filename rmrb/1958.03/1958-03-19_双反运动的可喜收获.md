    The Gratifying Gains of the Double-Anti Movement

    Recently, the People's Daily broke with convention and improved its editorial work, giving the newspaper a completely new look, which greatly cheered the readers. This can be said to be the harbinger of a great leap forward in newspaper editorial work.

    The newspaper, adapting to the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, takes inspiring revolutionary spirit as its guiding ideology, and uses enthusiastic language to report more fully on important and fresh things in our national life. Recently, articles have become shorter, varieties have increased, and content has become richer. At the same time, the price has been greatly reduced, from two yuan and four jiao per month to two yuan, and the retail price has been reduced from one jiao to seven fen. These are also gratifying gains from opposing conservatism and waste.

    双反运动的可喜收获
    最近，人民日报打破常规，改进编辑工作，使报纸面目焕然一新，读者的心情也为之一振。这可以说是报刊编辑工作大跃进的先声。
    报纸适应社会主义建设大跃进的新形势，以鼓起革命干劲作为指导思想，并用热情洋溢的语言，比较充分地报道了我们国家生活中重要的新鲜的事情。近来文章短了，品种多了，内容更丰富了。同时还大大降低报价，每月由二元四角减为二元，零售由一角减为七分，这些也是反保守、反浪费的可喜收获。
