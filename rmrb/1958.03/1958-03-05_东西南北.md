　　"Three Treasures of the Northeast"
　　This year, the production of "Three Treasures of the Northeast" from Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province—ginseng, mink fur, and deer antlers—will undergo a leap in development. The province plans to expand the ginseng planting area to more than 4,730,000 square meters this year, an increase of 118% compared to last year. After six to eight years, the newly planted ginseng can be harvested. It is estimated that by 1965, the production of ginseng will reach 1,000,000 jin, seven times more than in 1957. (Excerpt from Xinhua News Agency report)

　　Xinjiang Seedless White Grapes
　　The main production area of the famous national Xinjiang seedless white grapes—Grape Valley Township in Turpan County, Xinjiang—strives to produce 400 jin of raisins per mu this year. The yield per unit area will increase by 16% compared to last year.

　　Last year, one-fifth of the vineyards in Grape Valley Township produced more than 400 jin per mu, and there was a small area with a record high yield of 1,206 jin per mu; however, 40% of the vineyards still produced less than 300 jin. This year, the township will boldly mobilize the masses and take a series of technical measures to enable low-yield vineyards to catch up with the advanced ones, and to make the advanced ones even more advanced.

　　Longan Honey
　　The agricultural departments of Guangdong Province have decided to actively develop beekeeping. It is required that by the end of the second Five-Year Plan, the number of bee colonies will increase from the current 70,000 to 300,000, with an annual increase rate of 30%-40%. The unit yield will increase from the current 5-10 jin of honey per bee colony to 50 jin, and the wax production will increase to 1 jin per bee colony. After completing the above requirements, 15,000,000 jin of honey and 300,000 jin of beeswax can be produced annually, which can further meet the needs of industry, people's lives, and exports.

　　Guangdong Province has lychees, longans, rapeseed, buckwheat, oil tea, sesame, melons, and other fruit trees, with a large honey source. The natural conditions are very suitable for beekeeping, and some areas have a long history of beekeeping. Guangdong's exported lychee honey and longan honey are very popular in the international market.

　　Freshwater Fish Farming
　　Jinan City suburbs in Shandong have a large water storage area, which is suitable for stocking freshwater fish fry. Jinan City has decided to vigorously develop freshwater fish farming.

　　In addition to the original 5,200 mu of water area in the suburbs of Jinan, 960 mu have recently been newly opened. These vast water storage areas have been fully utilized for fish farming.

　　More than 1.8 million freshwater fish fry of various types, such as silver carp, grass carp, and carp, have been stocked in siphon irrigation projects, Daming Lake, Meili Lake, and some small lakes and rivers. It is planned to stock another 600,000 fry this spring. These fish grow quickly, and 750,000 adult fish can be caught by the second half of this year. Calculating at 1.5 jin per fish, more than 1,000,000 jin of fish can be produced.

    “关东三宝”
    吉林省长白山的“关东三宝”——人参、貂皮、鹿茸角的生产，今年将有飞跃发展。全省计划今年把人参的种植面积扩大到四百七十三万多平方公尺，比去年增加118％。经过六年到八年，新植的人参就可以挖取，预计到1965年可产人参一百万斤，比1957年多七倍。　（摘自新华社消息）
    新疆无核白葡萄
    驰名全国的无核白葡萄主要产地——新疆吐鲁番县葡萄沟乡，今年力争亩产葡萄干四百斤。单位面积产量比去年提高16％。
    葡萄沟乡去年全乡有五分之一的葡萄园亩产四百斤以上，并且出现了亩产一千二百零六斤的小面积高额丰产纪录；但是还有40％的葡萄园，产量不到三百斤。这个乡今年将放手发动群众，采取一系列技术措施，使低产葡萄园赶上先进，并使先进的更加先进。（新华社）
    龙眼蜜
    广东省农业部门决定积极发展养蜂业，要求到第二个五年计划结束，蜂群由目前七万群发展至三十万群，每年以30％—40％的速度递增。单位产量由目前每群蜂产蜜五斤至十斤增加至五十斤，产蜡量要增加至每群蜂产蜡一斤。完成了上述要求，每年可生产蜜糖一千五百万斤，蜂蜡三十万斤，可进一步供应工业、人民生活和出口的需要。
    广东省有荔枝、龙眼、油菜、荞麦、油茶、芝麻、瓜类及其他果树，蜜源很大。自然条件很适宜于养蜂，而且有些地区已有悠久的养蜂历史。广东出口的荔枝蜜和龙眼蜜，在国际市场上很受欢迎。

    养淡水鱼
    山东济南市郊区蓄水面积广大，适宜放养淡水鱼苗，济南市决定大力发展淡水养鱼事业。
    济南郊区除了原有的五千二百亩水面外，最近又新开了九百六十亩，这些广大的蓄水面积已充分利用来养鱼。
    在虹吸管灌溉工程、大明湖、美里湖及一些小湖小河放养了一百八十多万尾白连鱼、草鱼、鲤鱼等各种淡水鱼苗。今春计划再放养六十万尾，这些鱼的成长期快，到今年下半年就能捕捞成鱼七十五万尾，以每尾一斤半计算，可产鱼一百多万斤。
