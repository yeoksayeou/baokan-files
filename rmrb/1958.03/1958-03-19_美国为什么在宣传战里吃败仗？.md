    Why is the United States Losing the Propaganda War?
    John Schneider
    (Originally published in the American weekly "The Nation" on March 1st)

    Someone said to me: "If you were in charge of directing America's propaganda work—"
    I interrupted him immediately, saying: "I don't have the stomach for that."
    What I was thinking was that if a person were responsible for propaganda work, he would have to send out a large number of boring "facts" to the world; he would have to describe the work and style of the die-hard Dulles in glowing terms; he would have to do things that he knew were impossible. May God have mercy on his tormented soul.
    The predicament we are in regarding propaganda work cannot be escaped unless: (a) there is a sudden, miraculous, and comprehensive improvement in our government, economy, education system, and cultural level, or (b) we—unimaginably—silence all the newspapers so that it is possible to use the so-called "Madison Avenue approach." (Editor's note: Madison Avenue is a street in New York where advertising agencies are concentrated, and the so-called Madison Avenue approach is the approach of advertisers.) From here, the situation is unpleasant, but we had better face it squarely. We cannot beat the Soviet Union in the propaganda war.
    If I were to run the propaganda—again, God forbid!—I would have to try to publicize the United States as a peaceful and mature national society. Well, peaceful and mature. Although this is a good and reliable tune, people have sadly noticed that this approach is impossible to succeed. Let's take a look. First, let's talk about peace:
    The Army, Navy, and Air Force should no longer desperately encourage their senior generals to attend any radio or television programs. But damn it, almost every program has hordes of senior generals. Every day, every hour, generals of the Army, Navy, and Air Force are bickering, bragging, issuing orders, and talking over and over again on the radio. The most sensational and irresponsible parts of their talks will inevitably enter the international communication lines. Is this the opinion of a peace-loving country? Hey! If someone ordered all those clumsy actors in military dramas to shut up, it would be a great day for American propaganda.
    Moreover, wouldn't it be great if Mr. Dulles were brave enough to get rid of the attitude rooted in his 1952 campaign political speeches? Since then, he has continued to send out this non-peaceful propaganda, such as "massive retaliation," "brink of war," "unleashing Chiang," and "liberation." Mr. Dulles alone has made it almost impossible for American propaganda to adopt a peaceful tone.
    But the military and the press are hysterically overemphasizing the development of weapons, which makes him fearless. To a foreign observer, it seems that the American sky must be black with missiles and rockets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, intermediate-range ballistic missiles, and probably tactical ballistic missiles and intermediate-range tactical missiles. They have issued dozens and hundreds of messages about launches, delayed launches, planned launches, and intended launches without restriction. Is it really headline news when this or that competing military service rather boastfully announces that it has successfully launched the first stage rocket of a three-stage missile for testing? It is not surprising if foreign observers conclude that these Americans are missile maniacs and rocket maniacs.
    So, let's consider what we would encounter when we want to publicize the United States as a mature, and therefore a stable, knowledgeable, and trustworthy leader of the free world?
    Alas, oh dear! How can others not see us as a naive, rich, uneducated, impatient, willful, quarrelsome, spoiled brat-like country?
    Is the ugly, discriminatory immigration policy pursued by the United States a policy of a fully developed civilized society? No.
    Is insisting that the old man Chiang Kai-shek, who lives in an isolated island, is the inevitable and only representative of the Chinese people a manifestation of wisdom and maturity? No.
    These things make a propagandist prefer to sell soap or do publicity for Broadway displays.
    Therefore, I told the person who wanted me to be in charge of propaganda that there was no solution to our propaganda problem. Any fool can tell him why we are losing the battle; no one, no one tells him how to win.

    美国为什么在宣传战里吃败仗？
    约翰·施奈德
    （原载3月1日美国“民族”周刊）
    有人对我说：“如果你负责指导美国的宣传工作——”
    我连忙打断他的话说：“我才没有那种胃口呢。”
    我想的是，一个人假如负责宣传工作，他就必须向世界各地发出大量枯燥的“事实”；他必须把老死硬派杜勒斯的工作和作风描写得天花乱坠；他必须做些明知做不到的事。但愿上帝怜悯他那备受折磨的灵魂。
    我们在宣传工作上进退维谷的境况是无法摆脱的，除非：（甲）在我们的政府、经济、教育制度和文化水平方面来一个突然的、奇迹式的、全面的改进，或者（乙）我们——不可想像地——叫所有的报纸都一言不发，以便有可能利用所谓“麦迪逊大街手法”。（编者注：麦迪逊大街是纽约广告商集中的一条街，所谓麦迪逊大街手法就是广告商的手法。）从这里看去，局面是令人不快的，但我们最好还是正视它。我们在宣传战争里打不过苏联。
    如果我来主持宣传——再说一次，上帝不容！——我就一定要设法把美国宣传成一个和平的成熟的民族社会。嗯，和平与成熟。这虽然是一个好的可靠的调子，但是人们已经伤心地注意到：这种做法是不可能成功的。让我们看看。首先，谈谈和平：
    陆军、海军和空军不应该再拚命鼓励他们的高级将领去出席任何无线电或电视节目。但是该死，几乎每一个节目里都有成群结队的高级将领。每天，每小时，陆、海、空的将军们都在广播里斗嘴、吹牛、发号施令、讲了一遍又一遍。他们谈话中最耸人听闻和不负责任的部分必然会进入国际通讯路线。这就是一个爱好和平国家的意见吗？嗨！如果有人吩咐所有那些军事戏剧的拙劣演员们住口，那将是美国宣传的大好日子。
    而且，如果杜勒斯先生竟然勇敢地摆脱那种根源于他1952年竞选的政治演说的态度，那不是太好了吗？他从那时以后，就不断地发出这种非和平的宣传，像“大规模报复”“战争边缘”“放蒋出笼”和“解放”。杜勒斯先生一人就几乎使得美国的宣传不可能采用一种和平的调子。
    但是军界和报界都歇斯底里地过份强调武器的发展，这就使他有恃无恐了。在一个外国的观察家看来，似乎美国的天空必然是黑压压地一片导弹与火箭，洲际弹道导弹、中程弹道导弹，大概还有战术弹道导弹和中程战术导弹。它们漫无限制地发出了几十条几百条关于发射、延期发射、打算发射、计划发射的消息。当这个或那个互相竞争的军种相当虚张声势地宣布它已经成功地发射了供试验的三级导弹的第一级火箭的时候，难道这真正是头版新闻吗？如果国外的观察家得出结论说，这些美国人是导弹狂和火箭狂，这并没有什么奇怪。
    那么，让我们考虑一下，在我们要把美国宣传成一个成熟的、因而是自由世界的一个情绪稳定、知识丰富并且可以被信赖的领导者时，我们会遇到什么情况呢？
    唉，哎呀！别人怎么会不把我们看作是一个幼稚的、有钱的、没有受过教育的、性急的、任性的、好争吵的、惯坏了的臭娃娃似的国家呢？
    难道美国所奉行的丑恶的、歧视的移民政策就是一个完全发达的文明社会的政策吗？不。
    难道坚持认为蛰居孤岛的老头蒋介石是中国人民的必然的和唯一的代表这种做法是智慧成熟的表现吗？不。
    这些事情使得一个宣传工作者宁愿去推销肥皂或者为百老汇的陈列品做宣传工作。
    因此，我告诉要我去负责宣传工作的这个人说，我们的宣传问题并没有任何解决办法。任何傻瓜都能够告诉他，为什么我们吃败仗；没有人，没有人告诉他如何取得胜利。
