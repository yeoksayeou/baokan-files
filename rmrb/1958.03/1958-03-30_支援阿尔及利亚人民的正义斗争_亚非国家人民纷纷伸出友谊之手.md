Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 29th: According to newspaper reports, donations are being collected everywhere in the United Arab Republic for the Algerian people. President Nasser donated one month's salary - 600 Egyptian pounds.

Fadel Galal, Chairman of the National Committee for the "Algeria Day" preparations in Egypt, said that the people of Asia and Africa understand that the struggle of the Algerian patriots is also their struggle for freedom, a struggle against imperialism which attempts to force them to accept military treaties and to enslave them. He said that the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine, as well as the so-called "Mediterranean Pact" that is being patched together, all serve these imperialist purposes.

Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, Youssef el-Sebai, said that on March 30, the people of all countries in Asia and Africa will show their complete solidarity with the Algerian people.

The Egyptian Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the Egyptian Trade Union Federation have both issued appeals, calling on all residents to join the people of Asian and African countries in supporting the Algerian people who are fighting for freedom and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: According to TASS, Tripoli, March 28th: To welcome "Algeria Day," a congress of representatives of all strata of residents was held in Tripoli, the capital of Libya. A special committee was established at the meeting to carry out "Algeria Day" activities and to raise funds to help the Algerian patriots.

Now, many banners and slogans can be seen on the streets of Tripoli, calling on residents to help the Algerian people who are fighting against the French colonialists. Libyan newspapers and radio stations have also launched extensive publicity campaigns to prepare for "Algeria Day."

"Tripoli News" wrote in an article entitled "Algeria Day is a Day for the Struggle for Freedom" that on this day, the people of all countries in Asia and Africa will extend a helping hand to the Algerian people who are struggling. Algeria Day - this is a sacred day of anti-imperialist struggle. It can be considered without shame as a day for the struggle for justice and against enslavement.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese People's Rally "In Support of Algeria Day" was held in Tokyo this afternoon. More than 400 Tokyo citizens, wearing badges presented by representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front who are visiting Japan, attended the meeting.

In the declaration it adopted, the conference stated that the Japanese people fully support the heroic struggle of the Algerian people for the independence of their motherland, and will support the Algerian people in every possible way.

The declaration expressed its firm belief that the unity and joint action of the people of Asian and African countries will certainly sweep away the colonialism that is lingering in the Asian and African regions in the near future, and will bring peace and prosperity to mankind.

The conference passed a resolution urging the Japanese government to request the French government, through the United Nations, to immediately start peaceful negotiations with the Algerian National Liberation Front and recognize Algeria's independence.

The conference also passed a resolution demanding that the French government immediately stop its brutal suppression of the Algerian people. The resolution also called on the United Nations to urge the French government to recognize Algeria's independence.

Kiwan, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front who is in Tokyo, spoke amid thunderous applause, expressing his heartfelt thanks to the Japanese people.

At today's conference, it was also decided to establish an organization to support the Algerian people.

In the past few days, people's organizations in major Japanese cities have held rallies and forums to support the Algerian people, and have donated funds to support the Algerian people.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 29th: The Indonesian Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee issued a statement today on the upcoming "Algeria Day," calling on people from all walks of life and people's organizations in Indonesia to support the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

In its statement, the committee called on the Indonesian people to hold various gatherings, issue statements and protests to express their support for the Algerian people's struggle, and demanded a halt to the Algerian war and peaceful consultations based on the recognition of the Algerian people's independence. The committee also called on the Indonesian people to donate medicines, clothing and cash to the Algerian people.

Taufik Maidani, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front who is visiting here, visited some ministers and political leaders on the 28th.
