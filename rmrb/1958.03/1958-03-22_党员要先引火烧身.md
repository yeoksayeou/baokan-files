Party members must first set fire to themselves
Li Zi

The current "Double-Anti" movement in many universities and colleges is developing vigorously. Problems have been revealed extensively, and some have become relatively deep. However, it must be said that there are still ideological obstacles both inside and outside the Party. Big-character posters have not been exposed thoroughly enough. How can the movement be further deepened? The masses are watching the Communist Party members.

The Peking University Party organization held a mobilization meeting for all party members on the 20th. Party leading comrades took the lead in "setting fire to themselves" at the meeting, reading out their own big-character posters. This is an important step in further developing the movement.

Communist Party members are not people without shortcomings. The ideological influences that many Communist Party members were exposed to in the old society have not yet been completely eliminated. Therefore, there are still many shortcomings and errors in their ideology, work style, and working methods. In the movement, Communist Party members should first stand up boldly to expose themselves, humbly listen to opinions; at the same time, they must also boldly expose others, patiently present the facts and thoroughly explain the reasons, and guide the masses to carry out extensive criticism and self-criticism face to face.

However, there are some Communist Party members who, due to their low level of awareness, have developed a tendency in recent years to pursue fame and fortune and disregard politics. They do not have a clear understanding of the significance of this great movement, nor do they have a clear understanding of the current problems in schools, especially the issue of "redness and expertise" in teaching ideology. Therefore, they are not enthusiastic or active in the movement, wavering and indecisive. Such party members have already fallen behind the advanced masses.

The "anti-un-red and un-expert" struggle in the "Double-Anti" movement in institutions of higher education is the decisive battle for the ideological remolding of intellectuals. The Party organization must do a good job of mobilization within the Party to strengthen the Party's fighting power. Every party member must set an example, "set fire to themselves," and carry out in-depth, meticulous, and arduous political and ideological work among the masses. Only in this way can the movement be pushed forward in depth and the ideological self-revolution be carried out thoroughly.

    党员要先引火烧身
    李梓
    目前许多高等学校双反运动都轰轰烈烈地开展起来了，问题揭得很广泛，有的也已经比较深入。但是，应当说，党内党外在思想上还有障碍。大字报揭露得还不很彻底。运动如何进一步深入呢？群众都在看着共产党员。
    北大党组织在20日召开全体党员动员大会，党员领导同志在会上首先引火烧身，宣读自己的大字报。这是运动进一步开展的重要一步。
    共产党员并不是没有缺点的人，许多共产党员在旧社会所沾染的思想影响，还并没有肃清，因而思想作风和工作方法还有许多缺点和错误。在运动中，共产党员应当首先站出来大胆地揭露自己，虚心地听取意见；同时也要大胆地揭露别人，耐心地摆事实并把道理讲透，引导群众面对面地开展广泛的批评和自我批评。
    但是，却有那么一些共产党员，由于他们的觉悟不高，近年来发展了追求名利，不问政治的倾向。对这一伟大运动的意义认识不清，对当前学校中的问题特别是教学思想中的红专等问题，还没有一个明确的认识。因此在运动中不热情，不积极，左右摇摆，进退不定。这样的党员，已经落在先进群众的后面。
    高等学校双反运动中的反不红不专是知识分子思想改造的决定性的一战。党组织必须在党内作好动员工作，以加强党的战斗力。每个党员都要以身作则，引火烧身，并在群众中进行深入、细致、艰苦的政治思想工作。这样，才有可能把运动推向深入，把思想上的自我革命作得彻底。
