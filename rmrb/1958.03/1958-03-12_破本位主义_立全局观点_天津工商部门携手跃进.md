Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 11th: The industrial and commercial departments of Tianjin have eliminated departmentalism during the rectification movement, leading to closer cooperation. Recently, they jointly formulated a Great Leap Forward plan.

In the past, the industrial and commercial departments of Tianjin were basically able to cooperate, but there were still some disputes and frequent mutual complaints. The industrial departments' opinions of the commercial departments mainly focused on the commercial departments' fluctuating purchase volumes of industrial products. When the market supply was tight, they would demand increased production from the industrial departments. When supply exceeded demand, they would demand production cuts, failing to guarantee the stable development of industrial production. The commercial departments, on the other hand, believed that the industrial departments only emphasized quantity and not quality; the variety, design, and specifications of products often did not meet their needs. Due to departmentalism on both sides, they often argued endlessly when connecting plans, signing contracts, and inspecting goods.

In order to promote close cooperation between industry and commerce, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a meeting of leaders from the industrial and commercial departments. At the meeting, the Municipal Committee pointed out that commerce must serve production (and also serve consumers), guarantee the purchase of industrial products, and do everything possible to organize sales. On the other hand, the Municipal Committee pointed out that the industrial departments must serve construction and serve consumers, and industrial production must do everything possible to meet the needs of the people. Both quantity and quality must take a Great Leap Forward. If industrial products are unsalable or of poor quality, it is the greatest waste. The leaders of the industrial and commercial departments conducted criticism and self-criticism at the meeting based on the instructions of the Municipal Committee, especially making a deep examination of departmentalism, so that the views of both industry and commerce were unified under the common principle of "developing production and ensuring the needs of the people", strengthening the socialist cooperation between industry and commerce.

In the process of implementing the resolutions of the meeting, both the industrial and commercial departments fully mobilized the masses, supported each other, and made demands on each other. Employees of commercial purchasing and supply stations went to factories to deliver guarantee letters, congratulating the Great Leap Forward in industrial production, guaranteeing active purchases to support production, and reflecting the opinions of consumers, requiring factories to produce products that meet market needs. Factories also sent representatives to the commercial departments to express their gratitude and guarantee that the variety, specifications, and designs of products would be produced according to market needs.

Due to the strengthening of political work and the full mobilization of the masses, the relationship between industry and commerce has improved greatly compared to the past. The industrial departments have formulated a Great Leap Forward production plan. The focus of the Great Leap Forward is on the means of production. The largest increases in quantity are in power irrigation and drainage machinery, various tools, lead wire, wire nails, window screens, handcarts and other farmland water conservancy materials. In terms of consumer goods, the focus of the Great Leap Forward is on large commodities, such as rubber shoes, paper, enamelware, aluminum products, and sewing machines. Many factories have formulated plans to improve product quality, and the quality indicators of many products are higher than those required by the commercial departments. In order to make the product variety, specifications, and designs meet market needs, the industrial departments have made many adjustments in production, overcome many difficulties, and added some equipment. Many things that were previously considered impossible have now been achieved after fully mobilizing the staff for discussion. For example, the varieties of plumbing equipment produced in Tianjin have long been incomplete, with a shortage of more than fifty varieties, which have now been filled. The output of No. 20 fine lead wire, which is most needed for farmland water conservancy construction, originally accounted for only 11% of all lead wire, but has now increased to 20%. Knitted goods could not be increased due to the limited amount of cotton yarn, but great adjustments have been made in the variety, almost all of which meet the needs. The industrial departments have also expanded the production of some products with small output value, time-consuming production, and low profits but are needed by the market. Among the enamel washbasins increased by the enamel factories this year, 200,000 are inexpensive "economic washbasins" suitable for rural needs. The output of aluminum sundries, which are time-consuming and have a small output value, has been increased by nearly three times compared to the original plan. For some products that are difficult to sell or whose raw material supply is limited, the industrial departments actively take a Great Leap Forward from the aspects of improving quality, saving raw materials, reducing costs, and changing product varieties and specifications.

In addition to helping factories solve the difficulties of raw materials and funds, the commercial departments also do everything possible to expand sales. In general, for products that do not present difficulties for preservation, the trade departments purchase as much as the industrial departments increase production. For some products that are not selling well in the market and commercial inventories are large, the commercial departments jointly study with the factories to change to the production of other commodities or trial-produce new varieties, so that production potential can be fully utilized.

### 破本位主义　立全局观点  天津工商部门携手跃进

    破本位主义　立全局观点
    天津工商部门携手跃进
    本报特约新华社天津11日电　天津市工业部门和商业部门，在整风运动中，打掉本位主义，协作关系更加密切。最近，他们共同制订了大跃进规划。
    天津市工业部门和商业部门过去基本上能互相协作，但是彼此之间仍有一些争执，经常互相埋怨。工业部门对商业部门的意见，主要是商业部门对工业产品的收购量时多时少，在市场供应紧张的时候，就要求工业部门增产，在供过于求的时候，就要求减产，不能保证工业生产稳定发展。商业部门则认为工业部门只重视数量，不重视质量；产品的品种、花色、规格经常不合需要。由于双方都有本位主义，过去在衔接计划、订立合同、验收商品的时候，经常争论不休。
    中共天津市委为了促进工商业之间密切协作，最近召集工业部门和商业部门的负责人举行了工商协作会议。会上，市委一方面指出商业必须为生产服务（同时也为消费者服务），保证收购工业产品，千方百计地组织推销；另一方面指出工业部门必须为建设服务，为消费者服务，工业生产必须千方百计地做到合乎人民需要，数量和质量一同跃进，工业产品不适销，质量不好，就是最大的浪费。工业、商业部门的负责人在会上根据市委的指示，展开了批评和自我批评，特别是对本位主义进行了深刻检查，使工商双方的观点在“发展生产，保证人民需要”的共同原则下统一起来，加强了工商业间的社会主义协作。
    在贯彻会议决议过程中，工业部门和商业部门都充分发动群众，互相支援，互相提要求。商业采购供应站的职工到工厂去送保证书，祝贺工业生产大跃进，保证积极收购，支援生产，同时反映消费者的意见，要求工厂生产符合市场需要的产品。工厂也纷纷派代表到商业部门表示感谢，并保证产品的品种、规格、花色一定按照市场的需要生产。
    由于政治工作加强，群众充分发动，工商双方的关系已较前有很大改进。工业部门订出了生产大跃进计划。跃进的重点放在生产资料方面，跃进数量最大的有动力排灌机械、各种工具、铅丝、洋钉、窗纱、手推车等农田水利器材；在生活资料方面，跃进的重点放在大商品方面，如胶鞋、纸张、搪瓷器皿、铝制品、缝纫机等。很多工厂制订了提高产品质量的规划，其中不少产品的质量指标比商业部门要求的还高。工业部门为了使产品品种、规格、花色符合市场需要，在生产上作了许多调整，克服了许多困难，增加了一些设备，许多过去认为办不到的事情，经过充分发动职工讨论，现在都办到了。例如天津生产的水暖器材长期是品种不全，共差五十多种品种，现在都已补齐了；农田水利建设最需要的二十号细铅丝的产量，本来只占全部铅丝的11％，现在已经增加到占20％；针织品因为棉纱数量有限，不能增产，但是在品种上也做了大调整，几乎全部做到合乎需要。一些产值小、费工时、利润低但为市场需要的产品，工业部门也都扩大产量。搪瓷工厂今年增产的面盆中，有二十万个是适合农村需要的廉价的“经济面盆”。费工时、产值小的铝制杂件的产量，比原计划提高近三倍。有一些产品销售有困难，或者原料供应受限制，工业部门就积极从提高质量、节约原材料、降低成本、改变品种规格等方面来跃进。
    商业部门除帮助工厂解决原料和资金的困难外，还千方百计地扩大推销。一般作到凡是保管上没有困难的产品，工业部门增产多少，贸易部门就收购多少。有些产品市场销售不畅，商业库存量大，商业部门就和工厂共同研究改产其他商品或试制新品种，使生产潜力充分发挥。
