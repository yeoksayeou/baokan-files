Xinhua News Agency, March 25th – In the double-anti movement, the central political and legal organs resolutely mobilized the masses, centrally exposed the "five airs," and criticized privilege ideology and conservative ideology, which profoundly educated all cadres.

According to statistics from the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Supervision, among the nearly 200,000 big-character posters put up, more than half exposed the "five airs" and other undesirable ideological styles. The leading cadres of the Ministry of Public Security resolutely invited criticism, with big-character posters criticizing all leading cadres from the minister down to the section chiefs. The double-anti movement of the Ministry of Supervision was conducted in conjunction with the Seventh National Supervision Work Conference. At the conference, people spoke out freely and thoroughly, and big-character posters were used to centrally criticize the erroneous thinking of some supervision cadres who, when going down to inspect work, did not obey the leadership and supervision of the local Party committees and the Party organizations of their units. Some even saw themselves as "supervisors," detached from the masses, and acted arrogantly. The big-character posters considered this a very harmful privilege ideology. The big-character posters of the masses in the Ministry of Public Security criticized some public security cadres for having very serious privilege ideology due to the convenience of their work. They emphasized the special nature of their tasks, were unwilling to approach the masses, and some even openly regarded themselves as special people, unwilling to accept the constraints of discipline. One bureau chief in this ministry took his wife to the viewing platform in front of Tiananmen Square to watch the fireworks on a National Day evening. When the staff asked to check the bureau chief's wife's viewing pass, the bureau chief said sternly, "Never mind her." The big-character poster criticized this incident, saying that holding a viewing pass to enter the platform was stipulated by the headquarters of the conference. The bureau chief was one of the persons in charge of the headquarters, so why did he know the regulation but not abide by it? The big-character poster demanded that the bureau chief examine his privilege ideology and pointed out that privilege ideology is a dangerous enemy of political and legal cadres and must be resolutely corrected.

Some cadres' bureaucratic airs and arrogance, stemming from their privilege ideology, were very strong. A section-chief-level cadre of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, when working in other places, called himself a section chief sent by the Central Committee. Before arriving at each place, he required the local authorities to send a car to pick him up and demanded that the responsible comrades of the local prefectural and county Party committees wait for him to hold a forum. When reporting work to the local Party committee, he insisted that the main负责人 of the Party committee listen to his report personally, otherwise he would not report. Once, when he was holding a forum in a county, he was very unhappy because the county Party secretary did not mention that he was a section chief when introducing him, believing that this introduction reduced the "effect" of his report.

During the airing of views, the masses also sharply criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of some units. The Party group of the Ministry of Justice of the CPC has held many meetings and seriously criticized the right-leaning thinking in the Party group's guidance work. This thinking is mainly manifested in neglecting the fundamental issue that the court is a tool of the dictatorship, and emphasizing that the court implements democracy for criminals. Cadres of the Ministry of Internal Affairs used "sitting in a bullock cart, catching an airplane" to describe the conservative thinking in the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. For example, in terms of disaster relief, cadres criticized the Ministry of Internal Affairs for consistently proposing passive slogans such as "no one should starve to death" and "no one should flee famine," which were too conservative compared to slogans such as "eliminate disasters" and "remove the hat of disaster area" put forward in some areas. In terms of urban relief, many provinces and cities can achieve self-sufficiency in 1958 through organizing production, but the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not study and promote these things. Some big-character posters criticized the Ministry of Internal Affairs for considering disaster relief more than disaster prevention, considering life more than the production of disaster victims, considering official management more than mass self-management, and so on, in disaster relief work.

In the airing of views in various political and legal organs, the concentrated exposure and criticism of shortcomings and errors in ideological style through mobilizing the masses truly achieved ideological exchanges between the upper and lower levels and between left and right, and criticisms not only did not hurt feelings but, on the contrary, made people feel more親切。 Many cadres said that this time they really tasted the flavor of rectification.

### 特权思想是干部的大敌  中央各政法机关坚决驱散“五气”

    特权思想是干部的大敌
    中央各政法机关坚决驱散“五气”
    新华社25日讯　中央各政法机关在双反运动中，坚决发动群众，集中地揭发了“五气”、批判了特权思想和保守思想，使全体干部受到了深刻的教育。
    据最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、内务部、公安部、司法部和监察部六个单位的统计，在贴出的近二十万张大字报中，揭发“五气”等不良思想作风的大字报占一半以上。公安部的领导干部坚决引火烧身，大字报批评到上自部长下至科长的所有领导干部。监察部的双反运动是结合第七次全国监察工作会议进行的，会上大鸣大放，通过大字报集中地批判了一些监察工作干部下去检查工作时，不服从当地党委和所在单位党组织的领导和监督的错误思想，个别的甚至以“监督者”自居，脱离群众，盛气凌人，大字报认为这是一种极为有害的特权思想。公安部群众的大字报批评有少数公安干部利用工作上的便利，特权思想非常严重。他们强调任务特殊，不愿接近群众，有的甚至公然把自己看成是特殊的人，不愿接受纪律的约束。这个部有一位局长在一个国庆节的晚上，带着爱人上天安门前观礼台上看放焰火。工作人员要求检查这位局长爱人的观礼证，这位局长声色俱厉地说：“不管他”。大字报就这件事批评说，持观礼证入台是大会指挥部规定的，局长是指挥部负责人之一，为什么知道这个规定而不遵守呢？大字报要求这位局长检查特权思想，并且指出，特权思想是政法干部危险的敌人，必须坚决纠正。
    有些干部由于有特权思想而表现出的官气和骄气是很浓的。人大常委会有一位处长级干部到外地工作时，自称为是中央派出来的处长，每到一地之前都要地方派车去接，并要当地中共地委、县委负责同志等待他去开座谈会。在向地方党委汇报工作时，一定要党委的主要负责人亲自听他的汇报，不然就不汇报。有一次，他在一个县里开座谈会，县委书记在介绍时没有说明他是处长，就很不高兴，认为这样的介绍减低了他作报告的“效果”。
    群众在鸣放中还尖锐地批评了有些单位的右倾保守思想。中共司法部党组已经开了多次会议，严肃地批判了党组指导工作上的右倾思想，这种思想主要表现在忽视法院是专政工具这一根本问题，强调法院对罪犯实行民主。内务部干部以“坐牛车、赶飞机”来形容内务部领导上的保守思想。如在救灾方面，干部们批评内务部对救灾工作提出的要求一直是“不饿死人”、“不逃荒”等消极的口号，这同有些地区提出的“消灭灾荒”、“摘掉灾区帽子”等口号比较一下是太保守了。在城市救济方面，很多省市通过组织生产的道路，在1958年就可以达到自给，内务部领导方面对这些事却不去研究推广。有的大字报批评内务部在救灾工作上考虑救灾多，考虑防灾少，考虑生活多，考虑灾民的生产少。在移民工作方面，考虑官办多，考虑群众自办少，等等。
    各个政法机关在鸣放中，由于发动群众集中地揭发和批判了思想作风上的缺点和错误，这就使上下左右之间真正做到了思想见面，相互交心，批评不仅没伤感情，相反更加感到亲切。许多干部都说，这次可真尝到了整风的味道。
