Professor Yang Huian – A Scientist Deeply Rooted Among Farmers

Putting aside airs, immersing himself among the masses and into practical work, closely integrating teaching, scientific research, and production, while continuously learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union – these are the keys to Professor Yang Huian's outstanding achievements in his work over the past few years.

The Huazhong Agricultural College once received a joint letter from members of the Hongqi Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Wuhan, which stated: "Mr. Yang is very concerned about the production of farmers and often comes to our cooperative to help solve some technical problems in production. When he doesn't have time, he writes to guide us. Over the years, our cooperative's production has greatly developed, which is greatly related to Mr. Yang's help." This Mr. Yang is Professor Yang Huian, the head of the Horticulture Department of Huazhong Agricultural College. Due to his close ties and deep feelings with the masses, many farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan affectionately call him: "Our Mr. Yang." Yang Huian himself often receives letters from farmers. During festivals, many cooperative members also come to Yang Huian's home to visit him. They regard Yang Huian as their good friend, and when any problems occur in production, they often consult with him and listen to his opinions.

Yang Huian has always regarded humbly learning from farmers and helping them solve production problems as the "most important" thing, and considers it his happiness and glory. Since 1951, he has begun to go deep into the rural areas of Wuhan's suburbs, establishing close ties with some vegetable production cooperatives and farmers, often going to the fields to study production issues with farmers and help them summarize production experiences. In Dong Mingwan's cooperative, he discovered that their planted potatoes and cabbages had high yields, so he often studied and learned with them, and as a result, summarized their experiences into the "Double-Ditch Close Planting Method for Potatoes" and the "Xiaoshu Seedling Cultivation Method for Cabbage." Many cooperatives adopted these experiences, and their yields greatly increased compared to the past. In 1955, the Hongqi Vegetable Cooperative adopted these methods, increasing the potato yield from 500 jin per mu to 3,200 jin, and the cabbage yield from 4,000 jin per mu to 7,200 jin. Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan originally did not have the habit of growing cauliflower. After Yang Huian went deep among the farmers, he discovered that a farmer in Heping Township grew cauliflower quite well. He repeatedly studied this farmer's planting method, summarized, improved, and promoted his experience, thereby breaking the past saying that cauliflower was not suitable for cultivation in the Yangtze River Basin.

Professor Yang Huian also enriched his scientific experiments in helping farmers solve production problems. Vegetable production yields in Wuhan have always been very low. To solve this problem, he personally conducted various experiments on the farm of the Agricultural College. As a result, he successfully researched the hotbed seedling cultivation of early-maturing tomatoes and other fruit and vegetable crops, as well as the method of cultivating strong cucumber seedlings, and the cultivation results were very good. Many cooperatives in the suburbs of Wuhan adopted his advanced technologies, which not only increased vegetable yields but also advanced the supply time. In the suburbs of Wuhan, the yield of tomatoes used to be only 4,000 to 5,000 jin per mu, but now it has increased to 10,000 to 15,000 jin. Generally, after adopting the hotbed seedling method for fruit and vegetable crops, they mature ten to fifteen days earlier. In April 1955, the cucumber seedlings planted by some cooperatives in the suburbs using the usual methods were mostly frozen to death due to the invasion of late frost, while the seedlings cultivated using Yang Huian's successfully tested method of strong cucumber seedlings were not affected at all, but instead reached a high yield of 9,000 jin per mu.

Professor Yang Huian's scientific practice and patient persuasion powerfully overcame the conservative thinking of some farmers and promoted the great leap in production. In 1954, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the slogan of "supplying the city with a variety of vegetables" to farmers in the suburbs. However, at that time, many farmers believed that the climate conditions in Wuhan were poor and not suitable for growing crops such as Chinese cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. Based on the characteristics of these vegetables, combined with the natural conditions such as climate, rainfall, and soil in Wuhan, he conducted analysis and research, and while carrying out experiments himself, he also went to the fields with farmers to study high-yield techniques when he obtained high yields. This eliminated the farmers' concerns, and the varieties of vegetables in Wuhan increased year by year. He also carried out many successful experiments in "summer vegetables planted in autumn" and "spring vegetables planted in autumn," ensuring that most vegetables could be produced all year round. He also took the time to teach science and technology to farmers in the suburbs. In order to improve the teaching effect, he compiled many easy-to-understand teaching materials, and also specially compiled some scientific and technological information into rhymes. He always answered all kinds of questions raised by farmers and tried his best to assist in solving them, which deeply moved the farmers.

Because of Professor Yang Huian's style of going deep among the masses and into practical work, his theoretical work and the actual situation were closely integrated, thus improving teaching standards. He asked of the vegetable cultivation teaching and research group he led to "go deep into the countryside and learn production experience from farmers," advocating the use of local examples familiar to the masses to explain scientific principles. Over the past few years, he has adhered to this approach, constantly paying attention to learning from farmers. He often used holidays to visit farmers with production experience, and sometimes even took his own articles and lecture notes to give lectures to farmers and solicit their opinions. In teaching, when some theoretical problems were not clear, he also went to the farmers to seek answers. In order to explain the problem of "intercropping and multiple cropping," he personally ran to Yangyuan, Yujiatou, and Jiefang Township, which were ten miles away from the Agricultural College, to study and search for specific and vivid examples with farmers, and then returned to the school to give lectures. Therefore, his classroom lectures were very specific and vivid and were very popular among students. With his help, all teachers in the teaching and research group also often went deep into practice and summarized the production experience of farmers to enrich the teaching content, changing the past problem of mechanically copying.

Yang Huian believes that participating in production on the ground is one of the best ways to improve teaching quality. Therefore, he often cautioned students to humbly and practically learn from farmers; and promptly criticized the tendency of those who were lofty and unrealistic. Under his education and influence, students also established connections with nearby farms and agricultural cooperatives, and many students also used Sundays to participate in labor in agricultural cooperatives. In this way, many students not only learned the theory but also learned cultivation techniques.

Putting aside airs, immersing himself among the masses and into practical work, closely integrating teaching, scientific research, and production, while continuously learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union – these are the keys to Professor Yang Huian's outstanding achievements in his work over the past few years. Just as Yang Huian himself said: "This is a path pointed out by the Party for intellectuals." It is not easy for Yang Huian to take this path. When he did this, he encountered a lot of opposition in public opinion. Some professors satirized him as "cultivating model workers," and that "agricultural colleges should cultivate scientists." They were keen on teaching and conducting scientific research behind closed doors, believing that this was cultivating an "academic atmosphere," and believed that Yang Huian's approach was "low-level," saying that his "academic level was low," and even calling him a "native professor." Professor Yang Huian also felt very embarrassed. However, the Party organizations of the college and department supported him, often telling him: This path is correct and should be followed. This gave him the courage to continue working. When the Party proposed the call to march towards science in 1956, some professors in the college again attacked Yang Huian, saying that his approach "would not work" and that he should return to the laboratory to conduct "profound" research. This also caused greater fluctuations in his emotions. However, the Party committee timely proposed that scientific research cannot be separated from agricultural production and supported him to continue moving forward.

Yang Huian often said to people: "Several years of practical life have educated me, and I have deeply realized that labor is the source of human wisdom. The masses have created very rich experience in labor; humbly learning from the masses and summarizing and promoting their experience is our responsibility. It is inconceivable that we, these agricultural science workers, can talk about agricultural science if we are separated from production practice!"

Years of practice have made him deeply feel the correctness and greatness of the Party's leadership. Precisely because of this, he always actively participates in various political activities and resolutely follows the Party. Last June, when a small handful of right-wing elements in the Agricultural College rampantly attacked the Party, proposing to "petition" to the Provincial Party Committee and demanding that a large number of Party Committee members "step down," he immediately felt that "the smell was wrong," so he stood up and fought against the right-wing elements, safeguarding the interests of the Party and the people. Together with some upright professors, he wrote the big-character poster "Starting from the Desire for Unity," insisting on accepting the leadership of the Party and helping the Party to rectify in a realistic manner. He also publicly refuted the speeches of the rightists on many occasions. His actions angered those right-wing elements, so they attacked Yang Huian everywhere and even threatened him. But he did not yield and remained calm and composed in the storm.

Yang Huian, an old professor who is already over fifty years old, is determined to take the path of a new type of intellectual under the leadership of the Party and strive to become a red expert. Over the past few years, he has been working diligently and has always maintained a hard-working and simple work style, paying attention to close integration with the masses. He was elected as a model worker in Wuhan City and was loved by the majority of teachers, students, and farmers. (Attached pictures)

Grandpa An (who is eighty years old this year), who is called a technical advisor by the members of the Hongqi Vegetable Cooperative in the suburbs of Wuhan, is also Professor Yang Huian's teacher. Since 1954, he has often gone to Grandpa An's home to ask Grandpa An for advice. This is Grandpa An talking to him about how to decide the amount of irrigation water in combination with the climate.

Professor Yang Huian often goes to the countryside to check the contradictory problems in his teaching and practice, so as to better integrate teaching, scientific research, and production. This is him talking to students about the management of hotbeds after snowfall in the Hongqi Vegetable Cooperative. Photo by Zhang Qijun (Xinhua News Agency)

    深入农民的科学家——杨惠安
    放下架子，深入群众，深入实际，把教学、科学研究和生产三者紧密结合起来，同时又不断地学习苏联的先进经验，这是杨惠安教授几年来在工作上取得卓越成绩的关键。
    新华社记者　殷　平
    华中农学院曾接到武汉市郊区红旗蔬菜生产合作社社员们这样一封联名信，信中说：“杨先生对农民生产很关心，经常到我们社里来帮助解决一些生产技术问题，没有时间就写信来指导。几年来我们社里的生产有很大发展，与杨先生的帮助关系很大。”这个杨先生就是华中农学院园艺系主任杨惠安教授，由于他和群众的密切联系和深厚的感情，武汉郊区许多农民亲切地称他：“我们的杨先生。”杨惠安自己也经常接到农民的来信。每逢节日，不少社员还到杨惠安家里去看他。他们把杨惠安看成自己的好朋友，生产上发生了什么问题时，常来和他商量，听取他的意见。
    杨惠安一直把虚心向农民学习并帮助农民解决生产问题作为“最重要”的事情，引以为自己的幸福和光荣。从1951年起，他就开始深入到武汉郊区农村，跟一部分蔬菜生产合作社和农民建立了密切的联系，经常到田间去和农民一起研究生产问题，帮助他们总结生产经验。他在董明万的合作社中，发现他们栽种的马铃薯和甘兰都有较高的产量，就经常和他们一起研究学习，结果把他们的经验总结成为“马铃薯双沟密植栽种法”和“甘兰小暑养苗法”。许多合作社采用这些经验后，产量较过去大大提高了。红旗蔬菜合作社在1955年采用这些方法，就使马铃薯从亩产五百斤提高到三千二百斤，甘兰也从亩产四千斤提高到七千二百斤。武汉郊区农民本来没有种植花椰菜的习惯，杨惠安深入到农民中后，发现和平乡有一个农民种的花椰菜长得不坏。他反复地研究了这个农民的栽种方法，把他的经验加以总结、提高和推广，从而打破了过去人们传说的长江流域不宜种花椰菜的说法。
    杨惠安教授在帮助农民解决生产问题中，也丰富了自己的科学试验。武汉地区蔬菜生产产量一向很低，为了解决这个问题，他亲手在农学院的农场里进行了多种试验。结果他研究成功了早熟蕃茄等果菜类的温床养苗和黄瓜壮苗的方法，栽培效果都很好。武汉郊区许多合作社采用他的这些先进技术后，既提高了蔬菜产量，又提早了供应时间。武汉郊区的蕃茄过去只亩产四、五千斤，现在已提高为一万斤到一万五千斤；一般果菜类蔬菜在采用温床育苗法后，提前了十天到十五天成熟。1955年4月，郊区一些合作社用通常的方法种植的黄瓜，因遭受晚霜的侵袭大部冻死，而用杨惠安试验成功的黄瓜壮苗法培育的秧苗却丝毫未受影响，相反达到每亩九千斤的高额产量。
    杨惠安教授的科学实践和耐心说服的态度，有力地克服了某些农民的保守思想，促进了生产大跃进。1954年，中共武汉市委向郊区农民提出了“以多种多样的蔬菜供应城市”的口号。但当时有许多农民认为武汉地区气候条件差，不适宜于栽种大白菜、花菜、檗兰等作物，他就根据这些蔬菜的特性，结合武汉地区的气候、雨量、土壤等自然条件进行了分析研究，自己一边动手进行试验，在获得高额产量时，又和农民一起到田间研究丰产技术，这样消除了农民的顾虑，使武汉地区的蔬菜品种逐年增加。他在
  “夏菜秋种”和“春菜秋种”等方面也进行了许多成功的试验，保证了大部分蔬菜能够长年生产。他还抽出时间为郊区农民讲授科学技术，为了提高讲授效果，他编了许多通俗易懂的讲稿，还特地把一些科学技术编成顺口溜。对农民提出的各种问题，他总是作到有问必答，尽力地协助解决，使农民深受感动。
    由于杨惠安教授深入群众、深入实际的作风，使他在教学工作中，理论和实际紧紧结合在一起，提高了教学水平。他对自己领导的蔬菜栽培教研组提出的要求是“深入农村，向农民学习生产经验”，主张用群众熟悉的本地事例来解释科学原理。几年来，他坚持了这种作法，随时注意向农民学习。他经常利用假日去访问有生产经验的农民，有时还拿着自己写的文章、讲稿，去讲给农民听，征求他们的意见。在教学中，有些理论问题讲不清时，他也到农民中去寻求解答。为了讲解“间作多次作”的问题，他亲自跑到离农学院十里路远的杨园、余家头和解放乡等地，跟农民一起研究、搜寻具体生动的实例，再回校进行讲课。因此，他的课堂讲授十分具体、生动，很受学生的欢迎。在他的帮助下，全教研组教师也经常深入实际，总结农民的生产经验来充实教学内容，改变了过去生搬硬套的毛病。
    杨惠安认为，实地参加生产是提高教学质量的最好办法之一。因此，他常告诫学生要虚心踏实地向农民学习；并且对那种好高鹜远、不联系实际的偏向，及时地进行批评。在他的教育和影响下，学生们与附近农场、农业社也建立了联系，不少学生还利用星期日到农业社参加劳动。这样，就使得许多学生不但学到了理论，同时也学到了栽培技术。
    放下架子，深入群众，深入实际，把教学、科学研究和生产这三者紧密结合起来，同时又不断地学习苏联的先进经验，这是杨惠安几年来在工作上取得卓越成绩的关键。正像杨惠安自己所说的：“这是党指给知识分子的一条道路”。杨惠安走这条道路是不容易的。当他这样作时，他曾遭到很多舆论的反对。有些教授讽刺他是在“培养劳动模范”，而“农学院应该培养科学家”。他们热衷于关起门来教书和进行科学研究工作，认为这是培养“学术风气”，认为杨惠安采取的方法是“低级”的，说他的“学术水平低”，甚至称他是“土教授”。杨惠安教授也感到很为难。但是，院、系党组织支持了他，经常告诉他：这条道路是正确的，应该遵循着它前进。这样，就使他产生了继续干下去的勇气。1956年党提出向科学进军的召号时，院内有些教授又大肆攻击杨惠安，说他的作法“不行了”，应该回到实验室里去进行“高深”的研究，这也使他的情绪有过较大的波动。但是，党委又及时提出科学研究不能离开农业生产，支持他继续前进。
    杨惠安常常对人说：“几年的实际生活教育了我，使我深深体会到劳动就是人类智慧的源泉。群众在劳动中创造了非常丰富的经验；虚心向群众学习，把他们的经验加以总结和推广，是我们的一种责任。不可设想，我们这些农业科学工作者，离开了生产实际，还能谈什么农业科学！”
    几年来的实践使他深深感到党的领导的正确和伟大。正因为如此，他总是积极参加各种政治活动，坚决跟着党走。去年6月间，当农学院有一小撮右派分子猖狂向党进攻，提出要到省委“请愿”，指名要大批党委委员“下台”的时候，他立即感到“气味不对头”，就站出来和右派分子斗争，维护党和人民的利益。他和一些正直的教授一起，写出了“从团结愿望出发”的大字报，坚持必须接受党的领导，实事求是地帮助党整风。他还多次地公开发言批驳右派言论。他这样作，激怒了那些右派分子，所以他们到处攻击杨惠安，甚至对他进行威胁。但他没有屈服，仍然沉着、镇定地在暴风雨中战斗着。
    已经是五十多岁的老教授杨惠安，决心在党的领导下走新型知识分子的道路，争取成为一个红色专家。几年来，他一直勤勤恳恳地工作，始终保持着艰苦朴素、注意和群众密切结合的工作作风。他曾被选为武汉市的劳动模范，受到了广大教师、学生和农民群众的爱戴。（附图片）
    被武汉市郊区红旗蔬菜合作社社员称为技术顾问的安大爹（今年已经八十岁了）也是杨惠安教授的老师。他从1954年开始就经常到安大爹家去向安大爹请教。这是安大爹向他谈如何结合气候决定灌水量多少的问题。
    杨惠安教授经常下乡检查自己在教学和实践中的矛盾问题，以便更好地把教学、科学研究和生产结合起来。这是他在红旗蔬菜社和实习的学生谈下雪后应该注意温床的管理。张其军摄（新华社稿）
