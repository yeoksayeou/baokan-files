Changes in the Wholesale Store
By our reporter Zhang Wei

After raising their consciousness during the rectification campaign, the employees of the Wuhan City Cultural Goods Company's Physical Education and Sports Instrument Wholesale Store universally demanded improvements in business management and requested a special discussion centered on anti-waste, titled "Improve Business Management, Enhance Service Quality."

During the discussion, they exposed many instances of waste, analyzed the causes, criticized bureaucratic leadership, and also engaged in criticism and self-criticism.

Originally, the wholesale store's purchasing work was managed by the business section, while sales were handled at the sales counters. The two sides were disconnected, and the business section often failed to organize the supply of goods according to customer needs. At the end of 1956, in order to expand the variety of goods, they blindly purchased seventeen "dragon balls" with red canvas surfaces, each one meter in diameter. No one in the entire wholesale department knew their purpose, and they remained untouched for more than a year. They also purchased 150 East German single-lens telescopes (some costing 135 yuan each), but everyone was unsure whether they were machine parts or independent commodities, and they all piled up as inventory. Blindly organizing the supply of goods caused alarming accumulation. Some commodities could last for 138 years, others for 70 years. The interest paid on the accumulated goods was more than the value of the goods themselves. The employees angrily said, "It would be better to give these commodities away than to keep them and pay so much interest!"

Blindly organizing the supply of goods was inseparable from the bureaucratic leadership. They were careless when reviewing purchase plans, signing and stamping without clearly seeing what the goods were. For example, the leaders only realized that they had approved the purchase of the "dragon balls" and "single-lens telescopes" after the masses exposed them and they were displayed in the accumulated goods exhibition.

In terms of procedures and systems, it took eleven steps and five days of turnover from the time goods were brought in from other places to the time they were sold. Customers had to go through three procedures and run to three different places to buy goods, which took at least 30 to 40 minutes. Sometimes the warehouse was out of stock, but the sales counters didn't know, and customers often ran around empty-handed with their pick-up slips. The business hours were the same as government offices, which was very inconvenient for customers.

The masses demanded that the purchasing work be handed over to the sales counters to integrate purchasing and sales; they also demanded that the warehouse and sales counters be combined to facilitate customers and allow sales staff to understand the inventory situation.

Initially, the leadership believed that these problems were difficult to solve, worrying that the sales counters would not be able to handle the purchasing work and would instead mess things up. They thought that combining the warehouse and sales counters was a good idea, but they didn't have the space. Therefore, they cautiously proposed a three-step rectification plan that would take several months to complete.

At this time, comrades who had visited Jun County, Macheng, Xiangfan, and other places returned to the store. With great excitement, they conveyed the vivid story of Li Dahui bravely overcoming difficulties to bring water up the mountain, and the spirit of the Macheng Songbu Department Store, where only five sales staff worked continuously for ten hours a day, while also cleaning the store and actively delivering goods. Immediately, a surge of "learning from the revolutionary spirit of the peasant brothers and boldly improving work" emerged. After listening to the report in the morning, the store leaders discussed in the afternoon how to overcome conservative ideas, boldly break with convention, and improve work, and decided to change the original three-step plan to a one-step plan. After group discussions the next morning, all the employees proposed:

"We can make the improvements without spending a single penny or wasting a single minute of business hours." That afternoon, all one hundred or so employees of the store, except for a few sales staff who stayed to serve customers, set to work together. Some dismantled shelves in the warehouse, others nailed new shelves in the sales counters, and others transported goods on tricycles. They vacated the original director's office, Party branch office, secretary section, and two single dormitories to serve as warehouses. They completed all of these complex moving, dismantling, and nailing tasks in just two and a half days.

Now, customers no longer need to run around to buy goods. Purchasing and sales are also linked. The business section has been reduced from sixteen people to two, who are only responsible for summarizing plans, uniformly contacting external parties, and assisting each sales counter in preparing plans. The purchasing procedures have been simplified from eleven steps to four, and the turnaround time has been shortened from five days to two days.

To facilitate customers, they have adopted a method of delivering goods door-to-door. As long as the customer makes a phone call, they will send someone to deliver the goods. They also actively go out to make contacts and understand the needs of the market. They have established service standards and strive to catch up with the advanced service level of the Beijing Tianqiao Department Store in the second quarter of this year.

    批发店的变化
    本报记者　张碨
    武汉市文化用品公司体文仪器批发商店的职工们在整风中提高了觉悟之后，普遍要求改善经营管理，要求开展一个以反浪费为中心的“改善经营管理，提高服务质量”的专题讨论。
    在讨论中，他们揭发了许多浪费现象，分析了原因，批评了领导上的官僚主义，也进行了批评和自我批评。
    原来，批发商店的进货工作由业务股掌握，而销货在营业柜。双方互相脱节，业务股常常不能根据顾客的需要组织货源。1956年底，他们为了扩大花色品种，盲目购进十七个直径一公尺的有着红帆布表皮的“龙球”，整个批发部没有一个人知道它的用途，一年多来无人问津。他们还购进了一百五十个东德的单门望远镜（其中有一种每个价值一百三十五元），大家不知道它是机器零件还是独立的商品，也全部积压起来。盲目组织货源造成了惊人的积压。有的商品可以卖一百三十八年，有的可以卖七十年，因积压而付的利息比商品价值还多。职工很气愤地说：“这些商品留着背这样多利息，还不如送人合算。”
    盲目组织货源，与领导上的官僚主义分不开。他们审查进货计划时马马虎虎，没有看清楚什么货就签名盖章。如“龙球”和“单门望远镜”，直到这次群众揭发出来，摆在积压商品展览会上以后，领导人员才知道是经过自己的批准购进的。
    手续制度方面，从外地进一次货到销售出去要经过十一道手续，周转五天。顾客来买货，要经过三道手续，跑三个地方，最快的需时三、四十分钟。有时仓库缺货，营业柜不知道，顾客经常拿着取货单空跑。营业时间跟机关一样，非常不便利顾客。
    群众要求将进货工作交给营业柜掌握，使进销合一；要求仓库和营业柜合一，既方便顾客，又便利营业员了解存货情况。
    开始的时候，领导上认为这些问题不好解决，耽心营业柜包不了进货工作，反而把业务搞乱了。他们觉得仓库和营业柜合一很好，但是没有房子。于是，他们谨谨慎慎地提出了一个分三步走的整改计划，要几个月才能办妥。
    这时，店里去均县、麻城、襄樊等地参观的同志回来了。他们以十分激动的心情传达了李大贵勇敢的克服困难引水上山的生动事迹，传达了麻城宋埠百货公司仅有五个营业员每天连续营业十来个小时，还打扫清洁上门下门的干劲。于是，一个“学习农民兄弟的革命干劲，大胆地改进工作”的热潮立刻出现。店内领导人上午听了传达，下午就讨论如何克服保守思想，大胆地打破陈规改进工作，并决定将原来的三步计划改为一步走。第二天上午全体职工分组讨论后提出：
  “不花一分钱，不浪费一分钟的营业时间”就能改好。当天下午，全店一百来个职工除留下几个营业员照应顾客外，一齐动手，有的在仓库拆货架，有的在营业柜钉新货架，有的踩三轮货车搬货。他们把原来的主任办公室、党支部办公室、秘书股和两个单人宿舍腾出来作仓库。这样复杂的搬搬、拆拆、钉钉的工作，他们只用两天半的时间便全部干完了。
    现在，顾客来买货用不着到处跑了。进货和销货也衔接起来了。业务股由原来的十六个人减少为两个人，只负责汇总计划统一对外联系，并协助各营业柜编制计划。进货手续从十一道简化为四道，周转时间从五天缩短到两天。
    为了便利顾客，他们采取了跑街义务送货的办法，对方只要打个电话来，他们就派人把货送去。他们还主动出去联系，了解市场的需要。他们订出了服务标准，争取在今年第二季度赶上北京天桥百货商场的先进服务水平。
