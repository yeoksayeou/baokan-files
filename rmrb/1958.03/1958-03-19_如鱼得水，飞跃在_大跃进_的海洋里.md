Like Fish in Water, Soaring in the Ocean of the "Great Leap Forward"
Cao Yu

Currently, the socialist Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the country is surging forward like a storm. Literature and art are suddenly presenting an unprecedentedly active phenomenon.

The labor of writers should be "more, faster, better, and more economical." This has become everyone's common demand. Writing more can stimulate a surge of vigorous effort in writing. In a great era, it is impossible to write things shrinking back and hesitatingly. We must broaden our horizons and learn to write everything that is new to us: "subjects" that we were not interested in before should now be of interest; "styles" that we never used before should also be grasped and used now. We may only specialize in one of the eighteen martial arts, but we should still be able to pick up each one, so as to give full play to the strength of a literary and art warrior in the tense moments of battle.

Writing more is naturally not about producing shoddy work.

Recently, national literary and artistic organizations, opera, drama, song and dance, and music groups have made great leaps forward in organizing creation work. They have proposed tens of thousands of creative figures, which were unimaginable in the past. Some people are worried about the quality of these works. In my opinion, don't think that way first.

Today, we must vigorously promote writers to write, and at the same time, we must discover and cultivate people who can write among the masses. Seriously speaking, the national creative potential has not yet been fully explored. For example, many people have now read Qu Bo's heroic and tiger-like novel "Tracks in the Snowy Forest". After listening to a friend's introduction, I read it for a day and a night, and I couldn't help but talk about it endlessly whenever I met someone. But this is the author's first work. Before that, he had not published any articles, and everyone did not know him. However, through the training of rich revolutionary life, he was already a mature writer.

Only by eliciting the great source of the people's creative power will the magnificent works come surging forth.

Naturally, if tens of thousands of the masses and amateur authors are mobilized to write, their works may not be mature enough, or even be failures. But when it is written, published, performed, and sung, it will fulfill the role of enthusiastically inspiring the masses at that time and place.

Every stream flows into the sea. One article has the power of one article. We need the large sculptures on the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square, and we also need to supply farmers with a large number of small character color paintings. The coming great literary and artistic harvest will converge from all sides. The creations from the masses and amateur authors will surely produce dazzling flowers.

Writers should write more, and don't worry about whether it is good or bad at first. Don't write slowly and less because of just hovering over the consideration of improving quality. Sometimes, because we overemphasize the quality of writing, we can't write anything. Maintaining and improving writing quality is a very important task, but it is not necessarily contradictory to writing more and writing faster. Thinking of the needs of today's era and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward of the people throughout the country, I can't help but be eager to try and work with a hundred times more energy. At present, what should be thought of first is the role that revolutionary literature and art should play.

Good long masterpieces are naturally needed, but short, concise, pungent, and powerful things are more liked by the masses today. Writing how many essays, short poems, short stories, one-act plays, drum books, lyrics, character sketches, etc., and doing literary and artistic advocacy work is also an accumulation of rich practice for describing the long masterpieces of today's great era. No great painter does not make thousands of sketches before composing a large-scale painting. Writing more, writing more in various styles, will sharpen our pens, hone our thoughts, and increase our writing enthusiasm.

The more the spirit is used, the more it has; the more articles are written, the more refined they become. Boldness grows out of skill. We must create various new paths for writing. The key is to practice more, write more, publish more, dare to praise, dare to satirize, and dare to welcome all the lovely things of the new era. In a word, it is to never cease to exert a high degree of political enthusiasm.

Regarding creation and going deep into life, for a period of time, some people (including myself) were very much like the kind of people who envied others swimming freely, but were afraid to jump into the water. Today, revolutionary enthusiasm has pushed us down, so we plunged into the water and swam. In fact, today's revolutionary enthusiasm has pushed us twice: the first time, it promoted long-term stays in the countryside and factories to participate in labor and grassroots work, and the second time, it was today's setting big plans, making big leaps forward, making promises to the masses, and realizing plans. These two "pushes" are extremely good, pushing us into the ocean of the "Great Leap Forward", allowing us to leap freely, with a long wind of ten thousand miles, making us unafraid of all difficulties and striving forward.

It is an excellent thing for writers to go down to participate in labor and be with the masses. We participated in a very short period of labor, in the severe winter, carrying manure, delivering fertilizer, reclaiming wasteland, digging ditches, and watering wheat with the peasants. Although it was extremely short, there was nothing that we could forget, nothing that we did not love. I found that I was so ignorant and ridiculous among them, but also so happy and proud. It seemed that there was something to miss and something to record every day. Naturally, this is an extremely superficial impression, and long-term rooting and practical transformation must be carried out in the future. However, we have already slightly experienced the feeling of being with the people. That is, like a fish in water, a creative person has truly found a home.

"Like a fish in water" is the feeling of soaring and happiness of all the Chinese people in today's ocean of the "Great Leap Forward", and it is also the feeling of national writers today who are working on two fronts, both laboring and writing, living passionately and freely.

We must respond to the resounding call of the Writers Association. Write more, write better, write faster, complete and over fulfill our writing plans!

    如鱼得水，飞跃在“大跃进”的海洋里
    曹禺
    现在，全国各方面的社会主义大跃进都风起云涌，奔腾而来。文学艺术顿时呈现从来未有的活跃现象。
    作家的劳动要“多、快、好、省”。这已成为大家的共同要求。多写，可以促起在写作上的一股猛冲猛干的劲儿。在一个伟大的时代里，缩手缩脚，迟迟疑疑地写东西，是不成的。我们必须放开眼界，学写一切对自己是新鲜的东西：从前没有兴趣的“题材”，现在就应有兴趣；从来不用的“体裁”，现在也该抓起来用。十八般武艺，尽管我们可能只有一样是专长的，但仍应件件拿得起来，以便于在战斗的紧张的时刻里，发挥一个文艺战士的充分力量。
    多写，自然不是粗制滥造。
    最近全国的文学艺术组织，戏曲、话剧、歌舞、音乐团体，在组织创作的工作上有极大的跃进，他们提出成千上万的创作数字，这些数字是往日不敢梦想的。有人就有些耽心这些作品的质量问题。我看，先不要这样想。
    今天我们要大力促进作家们写作，同时更要在群众中发掘、培养能写作的人。认真说，全国创作的潜力远未发掘充足。举个例说，现在很多人读过曲波同志的如龙似虎的长篇小说“林海雪原”了。我听了朋友的介绍，读了一天一夜，兴奋得逢人便忍不住谈个没完。但这是作者第一部作品，在此之前，他没有发表过文章，大家也不知道他。然而在丰富的革命生活的锻炼中，他早已是一个成熟的作家了。
    只有引出人民创作力量的巨大源泉，那波澜壮阔的作品便会汹涌而至的。
    自然，发动了多少万群众和业余作者来写作，他们的作品可能有不够成熟的，或甚至是失败的。但是写出来了，发表了，演出来，歌唱了，它便尽了当时当地热烈鼓舞群众的作用。
    江海不捐细流，有一篇文章，就有一篇文章的力量。我们要天安门前烈士纪念碑的大雕刻，也要供应农民大量小幅的人物彩画。今后即将到来的文艺大丰收，将由各方面汇涌而来，从群众和业余作者们来的创作，必然出现鲜丽夺目的花朵。
    作家更应该多写，先不要顾虑写得好坏。不要因为仅仅盘旋在提高质量的考虑上，便写得慢、写得少。我们有时因为过分的考虑到写作的质量，反而写不出东西来。保持并且提高写作质量是一件十分重要的工作，但这和多写、快写并不一定是矛盾。想到今天时代的需要，全国人民大跃进的精神，便不由得跃跃欲试，干劲百倍。当前，要起革命文艺应该起的作用，是首先该想到的。
    好的长篇巨作自然需要，但短小精悍、泼辣有力的东西就更为今天群众所喜欢。写出多少篇杂文、短诗、短篇小说、独幕剧、鼓书、歌词、人物特写等等，做了文艺上鼓动性的工作，同样也是为了描写今天伟大时代的长篇巨作，做了丰富的练习的积累。没有一个伟大的画家，在构画巨幅之前，不做成千上万的各种素描的。多写，用各种体裁多写，会尖锐了我们的笔，磨快了我们的思想，提高了我们的写作干劲。
    精神愈用愈有，文章愈写愈精。艺高人胆大，我们要创出各种各样新的道路来写作。关键还是在于多练、多写、多发表、勇于歌颂、勇于讽刺、勇于迎接新时代一切可爱的事物。一句话，就是永不息止地发挥高度的政治热情。
    对创作，对深入生活，有一个时期，有些人（我也在内），很像那种非常羡慕别人游泳的自在，而自己又怕跳进水里的人，今天，革命干劲把我们推下去，就一头扎进水里，也就游起来了。其实，今天的革命干劲已把我们推了两次：第一次，推动长期下乡下厂，参加劳动和基层工作，再一次，便是今天订大计划，做大跃进，向群众立下诺言，实现规划。这两“推”都推得好极了，把我们推进“大跃进”的海洋里，任我们飞跃自由，长风万里，使我们不惧一切艰难，奋力直前。
    作家们下去参加劳动，与群众在一起，是一件极好的事。我们参加过一段极短时期的劳动，在严寒的冬天，和农民一起挑粪，送肥，开荒，挖渠，浇小麦。虽然为时极短，却没有一样事情使我们能够忘记，使我们不爱。我发现我在他们当中是多么无知、可笑，却又多么愉快、自豪。似乎每天都有可想念的，可记载的。自然，这是极浮面的印象，今后必须长期扎根，切实进行改造才成。然而我们已经些微体会了和人民群众在一块的感觉。那就是，如鱼得水，一个搞创作的人才真找到了家。
    “如鱼得水”，是全中国人民在今天“大跃进”的海洋中的飞腾、快乐的感觉，也是全国作家今天双管齐下，又劳动，又写作，生活得热烈而自由的感觉。
    我们要响应作协响亮的号召。写得多，写得好，写得快，完成并且超额完成我们订的写作计划！
