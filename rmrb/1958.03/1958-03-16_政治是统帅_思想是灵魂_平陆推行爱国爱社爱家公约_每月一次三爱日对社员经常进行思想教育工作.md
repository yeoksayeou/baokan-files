Politics is the commander, and ideology is the soul.
Pinglu promotes patriotic, socialist, and family-loving covenant.
Monthly "Three Loves Day" is held for regular ideological education of members.
    (Our report) (Shanxi Daily news): In order to consolidate the achievements of the nationwide rectification movement, the Wuxing No. 6 Cooperative of Chengguan Township in Pinglu County regularly conducts political and ideological education work for the masses. At the end of the rectification, based on the opinions of the masses, it formulated the "Three Loves" covenant of loving the country, loving the collective, and loving the family, and the system of observing "Three Loves Day," which has initially achieved good results. The Pinglu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has widely promoted the cooperative's experience. At present, 108 of the 143 cooperatives in the first and second batches of rectification in the county have implemented the "Three Loves" covenant.
    During the nationwide rectification movement, members of the Wuxing No. 6 Cooperative put forward a total of 863 opinions, including 565 on the operation and management of the agricultural cooperative, 221 on the work style of cadres, and 77 on corruption, theft, and concealment of production. These opinions were resolved on the one hand through party and league rectification, and on the other hand, a "Three Loves" education was universally carried out among the masses during cooperative rectification. In the "Three Loves" education, some members took the initiative to review their ideological behavior of not paying attention to quality in work, engaging in speculation, and not obeying leadership; at the same time, they also exposed facts of corruption and concealment of production. Under these circumstances, 17 "Three Loves" models were selected from bottom to top. At the rectification summary education meeting, a commendation and punishment exhibition was held, listing the 13 individuals involved in serious corruption and theft and their stolen goods in one row, and the exemplary deeds and prizes of the 17 "Three Loves" models in another row, to conduct comparative education for the masses. At the commendation and punishment exhibition, 403 members unanimously expressed that they would learn from the "Three Loves" models and resolutely oppose capitalist ideas and behaviors. After the great rectification and "Three Loves" education, of the 863 opinions expressed by the masses, except for 14 that were being resolved, all others were accounted for and settled. The masses reflected: "If this continues, the agricultural cooperative will become more and more consolidated." Some also said, "It's best to have such a rectification movement every six months." Others said, "It's hot during rectification, but cold afterwards, and after a long time, it becomes the same old way." Therefore, the masses universally requested that the problems and opinions resolved in the cooperative rectification be collected and formulated into a covenant of loving the country, loving the collective, and loving the family.
    With the "Three Loves" covenant, members have a weapon to fight against erroneous ideas and behaviors. How to implement this covenant? After discussion among the members, it was decided to observe "Three Loves Day" once a month. By observing "Three Loves Day," the implementation of the "Three Loves" covenant is checked. One month after the cooperative rectification, on February 2nd, all members of the Wuxing No. 6 Cooperative observed the first "Three Loves Day." Generally, the production team is the unit, and one article is read and checked against one article. Small problems are passed after self-criticism; big problems are handled after mutual criticism and improved understanding. This "Three Loves Day" found 77 problems of various sizes, and 84 people conducted self-criticism and mutual criticism. Among them, 13 people who seriously violated the "Three Loves" covenant were given key criticism. For example, based on Article 7 of the covenant, the members of the third team criticized the behavior of members Liu Xiaozhao and Wang Xiaozhao for disobeying leadership, abandoning agricultural production, and engaging in speculative business in the Yicheng area. Through the "Three Loves Day," a great debate against Liu Xiaozhao's capitalist road was launched in the entire cooperative.
    Through this "Three Loves Day," the "Three Loves" covenant was enriched and revised. The members generally reflected: The "Three Loves" covenant is like a mirror. If you look at it once a month, there will be no dirt on your face.

    政治是统帅　思想是灵魂
    平陆推行爱国爱社爱家公约
    每月一次三爱日对社员经常进行思想教育工作
    本报讯　山西日报消息：平陆县城关乡五星六社为了巩固全民整风运动的成果，经常地对群众进行政治思想教育工作，在整风的末期，根据群众的意见，订立了爱国、爱社、爱家的“三爱”公约和过“三爱”日的制度，初步取得了很好的效果。中共平陆县委普遍推行了这个社的经验。目前，全县第一、二两批整风的一百四十三个社，已有一百零八个社实行了“三爱”公约。
    在全民整风运动中，五星六社社员共提出八百六十三条意见，其中属于农业社经营管理方面的五百六十五条，干部作风方面的二百二十一条，贪污、偷窃和隐瞒产量的七十七条。这些意见，一方面通过整党整团解决；另一方面整社时在群众中普遍进行了一次三爱教育。在三爱教育中，有些社员主动检讨了干活不讲质量，搞投机活动，不服从领导等思想行为；同时并检举揭发出贪污和隐瞒产量的事实。在这种情况下，又自下而上地选出三爱模范十七人。在整改总结教育时，召开了奖惩展览大会，将十三个贪污、偷盗严重的分子和赃物列为一行，将十七名三爱模范的模范事迹和奖品列为一行，对群众进行对比教育。在奖惩展览大会上，四百零三个社员一致表示要向三爱模范学习，坚决反对资本主义思想和行为。经过大整大改和三爱教育，群众鸣放的八百六十三条意见，除十四条正在解决外，其余都做到了事事有交代，件件有着落。群众反映：照这样，农业社就会越来越巩固。还有的说，像这样的整风运动，最好是半年来一次。也有的说，整时热，整过凉，时间长了成老样。因此，群众普遍要求把整社中解决的问题和意见收集起来，订立一个爱国、爱社、爱家公约。
    有了三爱公约，社员就有了向错误思想和行为进行斗争的武器。如何贯彻执行这个公约呢？经过社员讨论，决定一月过一次“三爱日”。通过过“三爱日”，检查三爱公约的执行情况。在整社后的一个月，即2月2日，五星六社的全体社员，过了第一次“三爱日”。一般以生产队为单位，读一条，对照检查一条。小问题自我检讨就过去了；大问题经过互相批评，提高认识进行处理。这次“三爱日”共检查出大小问题七十七个，自我检讨、互相批评的八十四人，其中对严重违犯三爱公约的十三人，进行了重点批评。如第三队社员根据公约的第七条，批判了社员刘小昭和王小昭不服从领导，放弃农业生产，到翼城一带做投机生意的行为。通过过“三爱日”，在全社开展了反刘小昭资本主义道路的大辩论。
    通过这次过“三爱日”又充实和修改了三爱公约。社员们普遍反映：三爱公约好比一面镜子，一月一照，脸上就不会有黑。
