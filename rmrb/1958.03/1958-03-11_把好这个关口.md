    Guard This Pass Well

    Is the design ideology advanced or conservative? This is a major issue affecting the speed of national construction. An advanced design ideology can accelerate the progress of construction, while a backward design ideology hides serious waste. Over the past few years, there have been continuous struggles in design work, but none as thorough as the current campaign against waste and conservatism. Since launching the anti-waste, anti-conservatism campaign, the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau Design Institute has reviewed more than 180 engineering designs, revised more than 500 drawings, and saved the state more than 9 million yuan in investment. The Ministry of Chemical Industry Design Institute revised the standard design plan for a sulfuric acid plant, reducing the cost from 8.2 million yuan to 5 million yuan. These huge figures are the fruitful results of the great leap forward in design ideology. Without the great leap forward in ideology, it would be unimaginable to achieve such an economic harvest.

    The economic achievements can always be calculated, but the gains in political ideology are inestimable. For example, the idea of personal "monuments" in architectural design has been around for several years. Although it has been opposed several times, this ugly ghost still haunts some people. This time, in the mass airing of views, big-character posters, and debates, the individualistic "monument" was severely hit, and the vast majority of designers have a clear concept of what is a true masterpiece. Also, the conservative thinking of following the old ways in factory design has been around for several years. There have been disputes in the past, but they have not been thoroughly investigated. This struggle also unearthed this lazy thinking. This fact shows that once democratic practices are promoted and the mass line is implemented in technical design work, it immediately presents a vigorous atmosphere. The past statement that "technology is special, and the mass line cannot solve technical problems" is completely unfounded. In essence, the differences in technical design are also the differences between bourgeois design ideology and proletarian design ideology. Only by seriously criticizing the decadent bourgeois individualistic design ideology and establishing a design ideology of serving socialism and serving the people can our design work advance by leaps and bounds. It is unacceptable to use technology and style as an excuse to cover up errors in political ideology.

    Design work is an important pass in our construction undertaking. "A miss is as good as a mile" is very accurate for design. May all designers guard this pass well, and when you make every stroke, always consider more, faster, better, and more economical.

    把好这个关口
    静宇
    设计思想是先进还是保守？这是一个关系国家建设速度的大问题。先进的设计思想可以加速建设事业的前进，落后的设计思想则隐藏着严重的浪费。几年来，在设计工作中曾经不断有过斗争，但没有像今天反浪费反保守那样彻底。北京市规划局设计院从开展反浪费、反保守运动以来，全体设计人员检查了一百八十多项工程设计，修改了五百多张图纸，为国家节省投资九百多万元。化工部设计院修改硫酸厂标准设计方案，从八百二十万元下降到五百万元。这些巨大的数字就是设计思想大跃进的丰硕成果。没有思想大跃进，要想在经济上取得这样的丰收是不可想像的。
    经济上的成效总可以计算，而政治思想上的收获则是无法估量的。例如：建筑设计上的个人“纪念碑”的思想已经闹了好几年，虽然经过几次反对，但这种丑恶的阴魂却依然缠绕着某些人。这次，在群众性的大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论中，个人主义的“纪念碑”受到了沉重的打击，广大设计人员对于什么是真正的杰作已有了清楚的概念。又如，工厂设计中因循守旧的保守思想也闹了好几年了，过去也有过争论，却没有寻根究底。这次斗争中，也把这种懒汉思想找出来了。这个事实表明了技术设计工作一旦发扬民主、贯彻群众路线，就立即呈现生气蓬勃的气概，过去所谓“技术特殊，群众路线不能解决技术问题”的说法，是完全没有根据的。就其实质来讲，技术设计上的分歧也是资产阶级设计思想和无产阶级设计思想的分歧，只有严肃地批判了腐朽的资产阶级个人主义的设计思想，确立为社会主义服务为人民服务的设计思想，我们的设计工作才能大踏步前进。那种借口技术、风格来掩盖政治思想的错误，是要不得的。
    设计工作是我们建设事业中的一个重要关口。“差之毫厘，谬以千里”，对设计来说是十分确切的。愿所有设计人员把好这个关口，当你一笔一划的时候，处处考虑到多快好省。
