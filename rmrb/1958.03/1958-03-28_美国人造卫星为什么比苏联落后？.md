    Why Are American Artificial Satellites Behind the Soviet Union?
    By Abel Ducrocq, Director of the French Center for Atomic and Electronic Studies
    (Originally published in the French weekly "L'Express")

    The United States has adopted a "huge plan for small satellites" because they are not yet able to launch a major object into orbit around the Earth. Why?

    Here, we come into contact with a weakness in American science and technology. American industry has made undeniably great achievements in many fields, but American industry is definitely lagging behind in rocket propulsion.

    Mass Ratio
    The Americans launch their artificial satellites eastward, only at a thirty-five degree angle to the equator, seemingly wanting to use the Earth's rotational speed to add to the rocket's speed, thus gaining an extra one thousand kilometers per hour. Furthermore, it is significant that the Americans used a four-stage rocket to launch the "Explorer" satellite into its orbit. The Russians' rockets only needed three stages, while the "Vanguard" rocket, which was supposed to carry the "American satellite," also had only three stages. But the "Vanguard" rocket (which Braun himself believes is superior to the "Jupiter-C" rocket) is still unsatisfactory, so the Americans used a four-stage rocket, which does not require extreme thrust.

    In fact, the mass ratio for launching the "Explorer" satellite is very high. The mass ratio is the ratio between the total weight of the launch rocket and the weight of the object it can launch into orbit around the Earth. The rocket that launched the "Explorer" artificial satellite weighed 30 tons, while the satellite itself weighed only 13.5 kilograms, so the mass ratio exceeds 2,200. However, it is estimated that even using ordinary fuel, this ratio can be reduced to 1,000, while the Russians are using super fuel to achieve even better results. The mass ratio of the first Soviet artificial satellite must have been below 500. Now, Soviet technicians seem to have reduced the mass ratio to around 100.

    The Problem of Metals
    The Americans do not use super fuels, not because they are unaware: in recent years, boron chemistry has made considerable progress in the United States, and the United States is very likely not behind the Russians in this regard. The real difficulty seems to be in metal smelting.

    Using super fuels can reach temperatures of around 3,000 degrees in the nozzle, which requires alloys that are particularly resistant and extremely difficult to produce and process. In this regard, the Russians seem to have mastered the most advanced technology, as demonstrated by the achievements of the Russians in manufacturing civil aircraft. If the jet engines of the Russian Tu-104 and Tu-114 aircraft have almost twice the horsepower of jet engines on Western aircraft, it is because Soviet engines can operate at astonishingly high temperatures and pressures.

    A Trivial Few Kilograms
    Currently, the Russians have announced that they will soon launch a third Soviet artificial satellite the size of a "Simca Vedette" car (a French-made sedan, with an empty weight of about one and a half tons – translator's note), while the Americans can only launch small artificial satellites the size of a stovepipe. As early as November 3, 1957, the launch of the second Soviet artificial satellite had already proved that the Russians could launch a half-ton atomic warhead to any corner of the Earth. The launch of "Explorer" on February 1, 1958, shows that in the same circumstances, the Americans can only launch a trivial object weighing a few kilograms.

### 美国人造卫星为什么比苏联落后？

    美国人造卫星为什么比苏联落后？
    法国原子与电子学研究中心主任　阿贝尔·杜科克
    （原载法国“快报”周刊）
    美国人采取了发射“小型卫星的巨大计划”，那是因为他们还不能把一个重大物体发射到环绕地球的轨道上去。为什么？
    这里，我们就接触到美国科学技术上的一个弱点。美国工业在许多领域里取得了不容争辩的巨大成就，但是，美国工业在火箭推动方面，是肯定落后了。
    质量比
    美国人把他们的人造卫星向东发射，只同赤道成三十五度角，似乎是想利用地球的自转速度，加上火箭的速度，这样就可以多得一千公里的时速。此外，有意义的是，美国人利用一个四级火箭把“探险者”号卫星发射到它的轨道上去。俄国人（的火箭）只需三级就够了，而应该运载“美国卫星”的“先锋号”火箭也只有三级。但是“先锋号”火箭（布劳恩本人认为它比“丘辟特C”式火箭优越）还不令人满意，因此美国人采用了一个四级火箭，这种火箭不需要极大的推力。
    事实上，发射“探险者”号卫星的质量比是很高的。质量比，就是发射火箭总重量和它可以发射到围绕地球轨道上去的物体的重量之间的比例。发射“探险者”号人造卫星的火箭重三十吨，而卫星本身重量只有十三公斤半，所以质量比超过二千二百。然而，人们估计，即使用普通燃料，这个比数可以降到一千，而俄国人是用超级燃料而得到更优异的成绩。苏联第一颗人造卫星的质量比一定已经低于五百。现在，苏联的技术人员看来已经把质量比降低到一百左右。
    金属的问题
    美国人不使用超级燃料，这并不是因为他们不知道：最近几年，硼素化学在美国有了可观的进展，美国在这一方面极可能并不比俄国人落后。真正的困难似乎在金属冶炼方面。
    使用超级燃料，在喷嘴里可以达到三千度左右的高温，这需要特别有抗力、极难生产、加工的合金。在这一方面，俄国人似乎掌握了最先进的技术，俄国人制造民用飞机的成就足以说明这一点。如果说俄国人的图—104和图—114飞机的喷气发动机的马力几乎两倍于西方飞机上的喷气发动机，这是因为苏联发动机可以在惊人的高温和压力下运转。
    微不足道的几公斤
    目前，俄国人已经宣布即将发射一颗有“快速舰”式汽车（法国制造的一种小轿车，空重一吨半左右——译注）那么大的第三颗苏联人造卫星，而美国人却只能发射像一节火炉烟筒那样大小的小型人造卫星。早在1957年11月3日，第二颗苏联人造卫星的发射，已经证明了俄国人可以向地球上任何一个角落发射半吨重的原子弹头。而1958年2月1日“探险者”号的发射则说明：在同样的情况下，美国人只能发射几公斤重的微不足道的物体。
