    Red and Expert General Inspection, Teaching Great Revolution
    Fudan University's "Double-Anti" Campaign Targets Fundamental Problems of the School
    Mass Movement Brightens Everyone's Eyes, Individual Planning Makes Everyone Feel Happy
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Xi Ping reports: From February 24th, the day Fudan University started school, following closely behind Shanghai's factories and enterprises, a vigorous "Double-Anti" movement unfolded. This movement started with great momentum. In the three days from February 24th to 26th, faculty, students, and staff posted 430,000 big-character posters, exceeding the records of previous rectification and blooming periods. Departments and faculties also organized eleven exhibitions against waste and conservatism, which were truly spectacular. During the most intense three days, the enthusiasm of the entire faculty, students, and staff was boiling. Lights were on everywhere at night, and everyone was writing and posting big-character posters all night long. This "Double-Anti" movement at Fudan University is a new development in a series of political and ideological struggles since the rectification movement, and it is the most extensive and profound revolutionary movement.
    Since the anti-Rightist struggle last year, Fudan University has been at the forefront of the struggle. It was once one of the important strongholds for Shanghai's Rightists to attack the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, progressive teachers and students throughout the school defeated the Rightists' attack in this struggle, united and educated the middle elements, and expanded the ranks of the Left, which significantly changed the school's political situation. The once-interrupted rectification movement continued to unfold. The Party gained more and more support from the masses, and the socialist enthusiasm and initiative of the masses were brought into play. It was also at this time that the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress put forward the inspiring call of "Riding the Wind and Waves, Building a New Socialist Shanghai." The revolutionary upsurge influenced the faculty, students, and staff of Fudan University, making them recognize the great future of the country and their own responsibilities, and their desire for transformation became even more urgent. Thus, they began to formulate personal progress plans that were both Red and expert, requiring inspection and resolution of the problems that existed in both Red and expert aspects, and marching towards a great leap forward in both Red and expert.
    In January of this year, after the Shanghai Meilin Factory ignited the fire against waste, Fudan University once launched an anti-waste movement, exposing a large amount of waste in instruments and capital construction. However, at that time, the target of anti-waste was only some tangible economic waste, and it had not yet touched on a fundamental issue of the school—the various conservative phenomena in the issue of being both Red and expert. Therefore, the depth of the movement was greatly limited. In this "Double-Anti" movement, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee instructed that the anti-waste and anti-conservatism in colleges and universities must be combined with the characteristics of colleges and universities. Thus, the school clearly put forward the slogan of "Anti-Waste, Anti-Conservatism, and Great Leap Forward towards being both Red and Expert," and directed the spearhead of the movement at the fundamental issue of the school, namely, conservatism and waste in the aspects of being both Red and expert. In this way, the movement immediately became vigorous, like a storm, and finally formed the most profound and extensive revolutionary movement at Fudan University since liberation.
    What is the biggest waste and conservatism in colleges and universities?
    Just take a look at the more than 400,000 big-character posters posted by faculty, students, and staff of Fudan University in three days, and you can discover the difference between this movement and previous movements. This ocean of big-character posters, its quantity is so amazing, but its center is unusually clear. The vast majority of big-character posters revolve around one issue, namely, the issue of intellectuals being both Red and expert. People wrote conspicuously on the big-character posters: If the teachers of colleges and universities and the students they cultivate cannot be both Red and expert, then that is the biggest waste and conservatism in colleges and universities!
    A large number of big-character posters discussed the issues of teachers in terms of being both Red and expert. People said that the ideological outlook of the faculty at Fudan University has undergone fundamental changes in recent years, and the progress in this regard should not be underestimated. However, on the other hand, they still have many serious weaknesses in their ideological style. Take the leftists among the teachers as an example. Although they have basically solved the issue of political stance, they still have many shortcomings in their ideological style, especially in the practice of teaching and scientific research. As for the large number of middle elements, although they have undergone a political exercise in the anti-Rightist struggle, the issue of stance has not been resolved, and the bourgeois ideology manifested in academics is even more. For example, one cartoon exposed a teacher who reads books behind closed doors for a long time, does not ask about politics, and even hangs a couplet written by himself at home: "Living in the bustling city alone, reading the remaining chapters with a red candle burning high." Big-character posters exposed that some professors in the biology department recommended Morgan's theory to students without criticism, and rudely belittled the role of Michurin's theory. Law students proposed that some teachers uncritically propagated old legal views, emphasized the so-called independence of the court and vertical leadership of the procuratorate, without emphasizing the leadership of the Party; emphasized humanism without emphasizing the dictatorship over the enemy. Big-character posters in the Department of Foreign Languages exposed that some professors promoted vulgar Western lifestyles in classroom teaching.
    Another problem in the teachers' being both Red and expert is that the teachers' potential in teaching and scientific research has not been brought into play. Big-character posters pointed out that out of the 752 teachers in Fudan University from 1957 to the first semester of 1958, 186 did not undertake teaching tasks. Big-character posters in the Department of Economics said: At present, if the teachers of the Department of Economics fully exert their potential, they can run another Department of Economics. There is a similar situation in scientific research work. At the anti-waste exhibition in the Department of Biology, a statistical table of scientific papers published by five major professors in the department was posted, indicating that the number of professors' scientific works has decreased. Professor Tan Jiazhen, the director of the department, has not written any in recent years since liberation. Big-character posters called on these comrades to muster the revolutionary spirit of socialism and strive for the upstream.
    The innovation of teaching and scientific research is another aspect of the discussion of Red and expert issues. The most exposed is the separation of theory from practice, which involves almost all departments. Students in the Department of Economics studied statistics for a year and a half, but have not seen a statistical report in an enterprise. Some students can't even understand the various indicators of my country's five-year plan. In literature courses, teachers only talk about abstract concepts without asking about literary ideas, do not study the Party's literary and artistic policies, and do not use Marxism-Leninism to analyze works, with the result that some students are captured by the decadent and nihilistic ideas in classical literature. Students in the Department of Economics summarized this teaching as "four more and four less" in big-character posters: "More clauses, less practice; more foreign, less Chinese; more history, less present; more abstract theory, less resolution of ideological problems." This tendency also exists in natural science courses. Numerous big-character posters in the Department of Mathematics proposed that, from the current state of national economic development, the Department of Mathematics of colleges and universities should begin to pay attention to cultivating proficient computing talents, but Fudan University has always ignored this point. Shanghai is a chemical industry base, which has developed rapidly in recent years, but the Department of Chemical Engineering believes that they are engaged in "pure science" and have never had contact with the chemical industry sector. While exposing shortcomings in this regard, big-character posters also put forward many positive suggestions: students in the Department of Economics proposed that students should combine work-study programs with production internships; students majoring in industrial economics proposed to run "experimental fields" and fix themselves to a factory to work and study. History students proposed that it is best to participate in the work of sorting out historical materials and excavating cultural relics during the internship period.
    "Why is the student attrition rate so high?" "How can we eliminate waste products and defective products among students?" This issue aroused heated discussions in big-character posters. Big-character posters in the Department of Chemistry exposed that the attrition rate of fourth-year students in the department reached 27%. Big-character posters in the Department of History said that a total of 27 students were eliminated from the second, third, and fourth grades of the department.
    In short, these more than 400,000 big-character posters are a general inspection of the issue of being both Red and expert by the faculty, students, and staff of Fudan University, and also a great leap forward in their thinking.
    Combining the "Double-Anti" campaign with the formulation of personal plans to be both Red and expert
    In recent years, most intellectuals in Fudan University have increasingly seen the great future of socialism and the path they should take. Therefore, they are eager to be both Red and expert, more Red and more expert. Before the "Double-Anti" movement, old teachers and young students formulated personal plans to be both Red and expert, which was a manifestation of this enthusiasm; however, at that time, without experiencing a mass movement such as the "Double-Anti" campaign, the problems were not fully exposed, and the direction of effort was still relatively vague. After more than 400,000 big-character posters were posted, everyone's eyes were brightened. At this time, the school timely launched a call to "compare plans, compare advanced, do a good job in planning, and catch up with the advanced," combining the "Double-Anti" campaign with the revision of personal plans. In this way, this activity quickly developed into a conscious self-ideological transformation movement with a happy mood. Teachers and teachers, students and students, and teachers and students happily unfolded criticism and "gave gifts" to each other. People everywhere talked about how to become an intellectual who is both Red and expert? How to hand over your heart to the Party and socialism? What should be discarded to move forward lightly. Each plan is actually an ideological summary of each person. The famous mathematician Su Buqing wrote in his plan: "After the education of the anti-Rightist struggle, I have determined to dedicate everything I have to the Party. I strive to join the Communist Party within two years in order to better overcome some shortcomings in my ideology." At the same time, he also proposed to make the research work of differential geometry at Fudan University catch up with the research level of Moscow University in seven to ten years. The first article of Tan Qixiang, director of the Department of History of Fudan University, is: completely change his position and strive to become Red in one or two years. He wrote: "In the past, I was a serious objectivist. It is okay to stay out of everything. Now I realize that anyone who is unwilling to participate in the ranks of socialist revolutionary struggle will inevitably be rejected outside the gate of socialism." He also said: "In the future, I am determined to take the words and deeds of the Communist Party as the criterion for my own words and deeds. If the Party's measures are inconsistent with my own understanding, I will ask the Party organization for help and must understand the ideology so as to achieve consistency between words and deeds. And strive to achieve this in one or two years." Recently, 35 professors and associate professors in the school formulated a collective plan to be both Red and expert, proposing "to be political revolutionaries, academic innovators, and promoters of teaching and scientific research." This slogan concentrates the common aspirations of progressive professors at Fudan University.
    Students also carried out this kind of happy and conscious mutual criticism and inspection. Some students who were relatively backward in the past now put their personal plans and other people's criticism records next to their beds and encourage themselves every day. Some people who originally had a gray outlook on life, were depressed or degenerate have also cheered up.
    A new situation of all-round great leap forward has begun to emerge.
    A leap forward in work must be premised on a leap forward in thinking. And the leap forward in work in turn promotes the leap forward in thinking. The "Double-Anti" movement in Fudan University is like this. Because everyone has truly reaped a bumper harvest in their thinking, the rectification work has truly become everyone's business. A new situation of great reform and great leap forward has begun to emerge in teaching and scientific research work. Everyone feels happy and full of energy. Many major problems that seemed unsolvable in the past have now been solved smoothly and quickly because the masses have improved their understanding and have been fully mobilized. Teachers in various departments of social sciences are examining and overcoming the dogmatism of past theories that were divorced from reality. The sections of political economics and socialist economics in the Department of Economics have decided to try the "blooming, debate, and summary" method for teaching this semester. The course of literary theory will focus on teaching the Party's literary and artistic policies, and invite people from the Writers Association to report on the actual problems in the literary and artistic circles and hold special lectures. Taking full responsibility for students and correcting the phenomenon of "managing teaching but not managing learning" has become a school-wide activity. As soon as class is over, you can see many class teachers going deep into the students' dormitories to discuss homework and chat about ideas with the students. The Department of Chemistry has also established a system in which teachers go deep into the students' dormitories. In scientific research work, the enthusiasm of each department is very high. In the collective plan of 35 professors and associate professors, it is proposed that in five to ten years, the scientific research work of 15 disciplines should become one of the domestic research centers, and 41 scientific works, 348 papers should be written, and 63 associate professors should be cultivated. In the past, many teachers did not have written teaching materials for their lectures, but now they have all made plans to write them out. Many departments have begun to break the situation of each doing their own scientific research work. The cooperation relationship between departments, between departments, between schools, between schools and scientific research institutions has been greatly strengthened. The Department of Biology has signed a cooperation contract with the Academy of Sciences. These are all new atmospheres that Fudan University has never had before.
    The "Double-Anti" movement at Fudan University not only promoted the great reform of teaching, but also promoted the work of other aspects of the school. The work-study activity has become very popular. The number of students participating in the Department of Physics this year will reach more than 70%, the number of working days will be no less than 15,000, and the production profit will reach 90,000 yuan. After the students' own discussion, the physical exercise work has determined that 80% to 90% of the students in the school will reach the first or second level standards of the labor and defense system and 25% will reach the level of graded athletes within one and a half years. Other activities such as eliminating the four pests, greening the campus, and recreational activities have all been put forward as part of the great leap forward. The "Double-Anti" movement has promoted the work in various aspects, and the work in various aspects has in turn enriched the "Double-Anti" movement.
    The "Double-Anti" movement at Fudan University is continuing to deepen. At present, their main work is still to carry out large-scale rectification and reform, repeatedly check, and strive to make the reform thorough. Recently, each department has held rectification and reform exhibitions to conduct mass-based re-examination of the rectification and reform work.

    红专总检查　教学大革新
    复旦大学双反矛头指向学校根本问题
    群众运动使得人人眼睛明亮，个人规划做到个个心情舒畅
    本报讯　记者习平报道：复旦大学从2月24日学校开学的这一天起，紧跟着上海工厂企业之后，展开了一个蓬蓬勃勃的“双反”运动。这个运动一开始，就来势猛烈，从2 月24
  日到26日的三天中，全校师生员工贴出了大字报达四十三万张，超过了整风以来历次鸣放的记录。各系师生还自动举办了十一个反浪费、反保守展览会，真是洋洋大观。在最紧张的三天里，全校师生热情沸腾，夜里处处灯火通明，人人都在通宵达旦地写、贴大字报。复旦大学这次的双反运动，是整风运动以来一系列政治思想斗争的一个新的发展，是一次最广泛、最深刻的革命运动。
    自去年反右派斗争以来，复旦大学就处在斗争的前线，这里曾是上海右派分子向党进攻的重要据点之一。全校进步师生在党的领导下，在这次斗争中打垮了右派的进攻，团结和教育了中间分子，扩大了左派队伍，使学校的政治情况发生了重大的变化。一度中断的整风运动继续展开了，党愈来愈得到群众的拥护，群众的社会主义热情和积极性发扬起来。也就在这时候，中共上海市党代大会提出了“乘风破浪，建设社会主义新上海”这个振奋人心的号召。革命高潮影响着复旦大学的师生员工，使他们认清了国家的伟大前途和自己的责任，要求改造的愿望更迫切了。于是，他们就开始普遍制订个人又红又专的进步规划，要求检查并解决自己在红专两方面所存在的问题，向又红又专大跃进。
    今年1月间，上海梅林厂烧起了反浪费之火后，复旦大学曾经展开过一次反浪费运动，揭发了大量在仪器方面、基本建设方面的浪费。但当时反浪费的对象还只是经济上的一些有形的浪费，还未接触到学校的一个根本问题——又红又专问题上的各种保守现象，因此运动的深度就受到了很大限制。这次双反运动中，上海市委指示高等学校的反浪费、反保守必须结合高等学校的特点，于是学校就明确地提出了“反浪费、反保守，向又红又专大跃进”的口号，把运动的矛头指向了学校的根本问题，即又红又专方面的保守和浪费。这样，运动就立即变得生气蓬勃，犹如疾风暴雨，终于形成了复旦大学解放以来一次最深刻、最广泛的革命运动。
    什么是高等学校里最大的浪费和保守？
    只要去看一下复旦大学师生员工在三天里贴出的四十多万张大字报，你就可以发现这次运动与过去历次运动的不同。这一片大字报的海洋，它的数量是如此惊人，但它的中心异常明确，绝大多数大字报都围绕着一个问题，即知识分子的又红又专问题。人们在大字报上醒目地写道：高等学校的教师和他们所培养出来的学生，如果不能又红又专，那就是高等学校里最大的浪费和保守！
    大量的大字报，讨论了教师在又红又专方面的问题。人们说，几年来复旦大学教师队伍的思想面貌已发生了根本变化，这方面的进步是不可小估的。但是另方面，他们在思想作风上仍然存在着许多严重的弱点。就拿教师中的左派来说，虽然他们已基本上解决了政治立场问题，但在思想作风方面，特别是表现在教学科学研究的实践上，还有不少缺点。至于人数众多的中间分子，他们在反右派斗争中虽然已经受到一次政治锻炼，但立场问题还未解决，在学术上表现出来的资产阶级思想就更多。如有一幅漫画揭发一位教师，长期闭门读书，不问政治，家里还悬挂着自己写的一付对联：“独著青衿居闹市，高烧红烛读残篇。”大字报上揭发生物系某些教授毫无批判地向学生推荐摩尔根学说，粗暴地贬低米丘林学说的作用。法律系学生提出有的教师无批判地宣扬旧法观点，强调所谓法院独立，检察院垂直领导，而不强调党的领导；强调人道主义而不强调对敌人的专政。外文系的大字报揭露了有的教授在课堂教学中宣传庸俗的西方生活方式。
    教师又红又专方面的另一问题，是教师在教学和科学研究上的潜力没有发挥，大字报指出：复旦大学1957年到1958年第一学期，全校教师七百五十二人，其中没有担任教学任务的就有一百八十六人。经济系的大字报上说：目前经济系的教师，如果把潜力充分发挥起来，可以多办一个经济系。在科学研究工作上也有类似的情况，生物系的反浪费展览会上，贴出了一张该系五位主要教授发表科学论文的统计表，说明教授们科学著作的数量减少了，系主任谈家桢教授，解放后几年来一篇也没有写过。大字报呼吁这些同志鼓起社会主义革命干劲，力争上游。
    教学和科学研究的革新，是红与专问题讨论的又一个方面。揭露得最多的是理论脱离实际，这个问题几乎牵涉到了所有的系科。经济系的学生学了一年半的统计学，却没有看见过一张企业中的统计报表。有的学生甚至看不懂我国五年计划的各项指标。在文学课程中，教师只谈抽象的概念而不问文艺思想，不学习党的文艺政策，不用马列主义分析作品，结果反而让一部分学生做了古典文学中颓废虚无思想的俘虏。经济系学生在大字报上把这种教学归纳为“四多四少”：“条条多，实际少；外国多，中国少；历史多，现在少；抽象理论多，思想问题解决少。”在自然科学课程中，同样存在这种倾向。数学系众多的大字报提出：从目前国家经济发展状况来看，高等学校数学系要开始注意培养精通的计算人材，但复旦大学一直忽视这一点。上海是一个化学工业的基地，近年来发展很快，但化工系却认为他们是搞“纯粹科学”的，和化工部门一直没有联系。在揭发这方面缺点的同时，大字报还提出许多积极建议：经济系的学生提出学生在生产实习的过程中要和勤工俭学结合起来；工业经济专业的同学提出了要办“试验田”，固定到一个工厂劳动、学习。历史系同学提出实习期间最好能参加整理史料、挖掘文物的工作。
    “为什么学生的淘汰率这么高？”“怎样才能消灭学生中的废品次货？”这个问题在大字报中引起了热烈的讨论。化学系大字报揭发该系四年级学生淘汰率达27％。历史系的大字报说，这个系二、三、四年级共淘汰了学生二十七人。
    总之，这四十多万张大字报，是复旦全校师生对又红又专问题的总检查，也是他们思想上的一次大跃进。
    把“双反”和制订个人又红又专规划结合起来
    复旦大学的大多数知识分子，近年来已日益看清了社会主义的伟大前途，和自己应走的道路，因而迫切地要求又红又专，更红更专。在双反运动以前，老教师和青年学生纷纷制订个人又红又专的进步规划，就是这种积极性的表现；但当时没有经历“双反”这样的群众运动，问题未充分暴露，努力方向还是比较模糊的。四十多万张大字报贴出之后，使得人人的眼睛为之一亮。这时候，学校里及时地掀起了一个“比规划，比先进，搞好规划，赶上先进”的号召，把双反与修订个人规划结合起来，这样，这个活动很快就发展成了一个自觉的心情舒畅的自我思想改造运动。教师与教师之间，同学与同学之间，以及师生之间，都愉快地展开批评，相互“送礼”。人们到处谈论着怎样才能成为一个又红又专的知识分子？怎样把自己的心交给党和社会主义？应该丢掉些什么才能使自己轻装前进。每一份规划实际上都是每一个人的一个思想总结，著名的数学家苏步青在他的规划上写道：“经过反右斗争的教育，我已决心把自己的一切献给党，我争取二年内加入共产党，以求更好克服自己思想意识某些缺点。”同时他还提出决定要在七年到十年时间内使复旦大学微分几何的研究工作赶上莫斯科大学的研究水平。复旦大学历史系主任谭其骧规划的第一条是：彻底改变立场，争取一两年红起来，他写道：“过去我是一个严重的客观主义者，凡事不妨置身事外，现在我体会到凡是不愿投身到社会主义革命斗争行列中去，必然会被摒于社会主义大门之外。”他还说：“今后我决心以共产党的言行为自己言行的准绳，假如党的措施和自己认识不一致时，请求党组织的帮助，务必搞通思想，做到表里一致，并且争取一两年内就达到这一地步。”最近，校内三十五个教授、副教授制定了一个又红又专的集体规划，提出“要做政治上的革命派、学术上的革新派，教学科学研究工作上的促进派。”这个口号集中了复旦大学要求进步的教授们的共同愿望。
    学生之间也开展了这种愉快而自觉的相互批评和检查。有些原来比较落后的学生，现在把个人规划和别人的批评记录，贴在床边上，每天勉励自己。有些原来人生观灰色、意志消沉或堕落的人，也振作了起来。
    开始出现了全面大跃进的新局面
    工作上的跃进必须以思想上的跃进作前提。而工作的跃进又反过来促进思想跃进。复旦大学的双反运动就是这样，由于大家真正在思想上丰收了，于是整改工作也就真正变成了大家的事。教学、科学研究工作开始出现了一个大革新、大跃进的新局面。人人觉得心情舒畅，干劲充沛。许多在过去看来无法解决的重大问题，这次在群众认识提高，充分发动起来的情况下，很快地就顺利解决了。社会科学各系教师检查并克服着过去理论脱离实际的教条主义。经济系政治经济学社会主义经济部分的部分章节，本学期已决定试用“鸣放、辩论、总结”的方式进行教学。文艺理论课程将着重讲授党的文艺政策，并邀请作家协会的人报告当前文艺界的实际问题，举办专题讲座。对学生全面负责，纠正“管教不管学”现象，已经成为全校性的活动，一到下课时间，就看到许多班级教师深入到学生宿舍中和同学们商谈着功课、漫谈着思想，化学系并把老师深入学生宿舍定成为制度。在科学研究工作上，各系的劲头都很大，在三十五个教授副教授的集体规划中提出在五年到十年内，有十五门学科的科学研究工作，要成为国内的研究中心之一，并且要写出四十一部科学著作，三百四十八篇论文，培养出副教授六十三人。过去许多老师讲课没有成文的讲义，现在都订出计划，要把它写出来。许多系开始打破科学研究工作各自为政的分割状况，系内部、系外部、学校之间、学校和科学研究机关之间，协作关系大大地加强了，生物系已经与科学院订立了协作合同。这都是复旦大学从未有过的新气象。
    复旦大学的双反运动不但推动了教学的大改革，同时也把学校其他各方面的工作带动了起来。勤工俭学活动已搞得很热火，物理系今年参加的学生将达到70％以上，工作日不少于一万五千个，生产利润达九万元。体育锻炼工作经过同学们自己的讨论，确定要在一年半时间内使全校学生有80％ 到90％达到劳卫制一级或二级标准，有25％达到等级运动员水平。其它如除四害，绿化校园，文娱活动等等，都作为大跃进中的一部分提了出来。双反运动推动了各方面的工作，各方面的工作反过来又丰富了双反运动。
    复旦大学的双反运动正在继续走向深入，目前他们主要工作仍然是大整大改，反复检查，务求改得彻底。各系最近都举办了整改展览会，对整改工作进行群众性的复查。
