Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26th: The Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting on the 22nd and 24th, attended by secretaries and propaganda ministers from prefectural, municipal, and county committees, as well as cadres from provincial-level propaganda departments, and put forward a plan for a Great Leap Forward in cadre learning. This plan calls on the entire party to mobilize, study diligently, and assiduously research, so as to achieve unity of learning and application, and be both red and expert, requiring all cadres to vigorously attack the four "barriers" of political theory, technical skills, culture, and writing.

The plan requires all cadres in the province to study politics, read newspapers and periodicals every day, and strive to learn the two courses of "Socialist Great Leap Forward" and "Socialist Education" this year. The various departments of the provincial and municipal committees and the county committees should establish editorial groups to be responsible for writing editorials for newspapers and periodicals, so as to strengthen the combination of theoretical study and practical work. It is advocated that whether in meetings, discussing work, writing articles, or making reports, there should be viewpoints and materials, theory and practice.

In terms of technical and business learning, the plan requires that within three years, each cadre should learn a skill, be proficient in their own industry's business, and everyone should participate in the experimental fields of their own industry; each person should put forward one rationalization proposal related to improving work each year; cadres above the county section level should summarize and promote an advanced experience and write a report or article.

In terms of cultural learning, the plan requires that illiteracy should be eliminated among full-time cadres above the township level this year, and reach the level of primary school graduation within three years; cadres with a cultural level below junior high school should improve to the level of junior high school graduation within one to three years; cadres with a certain cultural level should each select and read an excellent literary work (300 pages as the standard) each year, and it is advocated to learn a foreign language on a voluntary basis. The plan also puts forward specific requirements for all cadres to learn Mandarin, foreign cadres to learn the local dialect, and cadres of minority nationalities and Han cadres working in minority areas to learn Chinese and minority languages respectively.

The plan requires that each cadre not only be able to speak but also be able to write, combining studying documents, discussing issues, making reports, making summaries, and writing articles. Cadres participating in theoretical study should write a note or article after completing each course. In order to improve writing skills, each cadre should learn the two courses of Chinese grammar and logic well.

The meeting especially required all propaganda work cadres to take the lead in the charge in learning.

    新华社广州26日电　中共广东省委宣传部在22日和24日分别召开有地委、市委、县委的书记、宣传部长和省级宣传部门干部参加的会议，提出了一个干部学习大跃进的规划。这个规划号召全党动员，苦学苦钻，作到学用一致，又红又专，要求所有干部猛攻政治理论、技术业务、文化和写作等四个“关”。
    规划要求全省干部要人人学政治，天天读报刊，并争取在今年内学好“社会主义大跃进”和“社会主义教育”两门课。省委、市委各个部和县委要成立社论小组，负责替报刊写社论，以加强理论学习和实际工作的结合。提倡无论开会、谈工作、写文章、做报告，都要有观点也有材料、有理论也有实际。
    在技术业务学习方面，规划要求三年内每个干部都要学会一门技术，精通本行业务，人人参加本行业务的试验田；每人每年提出一条有关改进工作的合理化建议；县科级以上干部则要总结推广一项先进经验，并写成报告或文章。
    在文化学习方面，规划要求乡以上的脱产干部中今年内要消灭文盲，三年内达到小学毕业水平；文化程度在初中以下的干部，在一年到三年内，要提高到初中毕业程度；有一定文化程度的干部，每人每年选读一部优秀的文艺作品（三百页为准），并提倡在自愿原则下学一门外文。规划对一切干部都要学会普通话、外来干部学会本地话、少数民族干部和在少数民族地区工作的汉民族干部分别学会汉语和少数民族语言等，也提出了具体要求。
    规划要求每个干部不单能讲，也要能写，把学文件、谈问题、作报告、做总结和写文章结合起来。参加理论学习的干部，在学完每一门课程后，要写一篇笔记或文章。为了提高写作能力，每个干部要学好语文文法和逻辑两门课。
    会议特别要求所有宣传工作干部在学习上带头冲锋。
