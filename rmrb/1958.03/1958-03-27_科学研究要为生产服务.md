Scientific Research Must Serve Production
By People's Daily Commentator

    A comprehensive collaborative scientific and technological force in Shanghai was formed yesterday. This is a major achievement of Shanghai's scientific research institutions, universities, and business departments in their great leap forward to combat waste, combat conservatism, and be both expert and red. The benefits of comprehensive collaboration are, first, to complete national production tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way, and in turn, it provides rich content for teaching and scientific research, achieving the improvement of teaching and the promotion of the development of science. It can also cultivate scientific and technological talents who are both red and expert. This is a good method worthy of attention and promotion.

    During the Two-Anti movement, many vivid examples of comprehensive collaboration between scientists and production departments emerged across the country. These examples not only provided scientific and technological data for the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production but also laid a solid foundation for the technological revolution. This is a good start for scientists to go from the study to the field, connect with production practice, transform their thinking, develop the people's scientific cause, and overcome bourgeois ideology in scientific research work. In today's great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is even more necessary to require scientific and technological forces to keep up and cooperate closely.

    However, not everyone fully understands the important significance of comprehensive collaboration at present. Those who hold bourgeois ideas, conservative ideas, and departmentalism in scientific research work often believe that collaboration is too troublesome, uneconomical, and hinders scientific research, or that natural science research itself is connected with practice, and that scientific research is to solve long-term problems, and that solving today's problems is the business of the production department, and therefore do not approve of comprehensive collaboration.

      Is comprehensive collaboration troublesome, uneconomical, and hindering scientific research? The countless facts of collaboration in Shanghai have refuted this argument, fully demonstrating that comprehensive collaboration is an important link in promoting the development of science. If it is said to hinder scientific research, it only hinders the purpose of using scientific research to achieve personal fame and status. This hindrance is very good, and it is also a good way for scientists to carry out self-revolution. Natural science itself is connected with practice. However, if you engage in research behind closed doors without close contact with production practice, you will also be divorced from reality. The so-called scientific research is to solve long-term problems, and solving today's problems is the business of the production department, which is essentially still a thought divorced from reality. With this kind of thinking, it is impossible to achieve scientific research serving production and cooperating with production tasks. Because industrial and agricultural production is developing and changing rapidly, even if you succeed in your long-term research, it will be far behind the actual situation. Wouldn't this also lose the role and value of scientific research?

    Comrade Nie Rongzhen pointed out in his speech at the Fifth Meeting of the Science Planning Commission: "Science itself is not the goal. Science for the sake of science is an extremely wrong point of view. Science must serve production, and today it must serve the great leap forward in production. If this is not clear, China's scientific cause will lose its direction. If the scientific cause is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, it will lose its great driving force and become dim." Everyone engaged in scientific research should recognize these fundamental issues. We must catch up with the current development situation in all aspects of the country, abandon all kinds of bourgeois ideas in scientific research work, closely connect with reality and the masses, bravely join the ranks of comprehensive collaboration, and truly hand over our hearts to the Party and our knowledge to the people with practical actions, thoroughly transform our thinking, and stride forward on the road of being both red and expert.

    科学研究要为生产服务
    本报评论员
    上海市一支全面协作的科学技术大军，在昨天组成。这是上海各科学研究单位、高等学校和业务部门反浪费、反保守、又专又红大跃进的一项重大成就。全面协作的好处，首先是多快好省地完成国家生产任务，反过来又提供了教学、科学研究的丰富内容，达到改进教学、推动科学事业的发展。还能培养又红又专的科学技术人材。这是一个值得重视和推广的好办法。
    在双反运动中，全国各地出现了很多科学家和生产部门全面协作的生动事例，不仅为工农业生产大跃进提供了科学技术资料，也为技术革命打下了有力基础。这是科学家们由书房到现场，联系生产实际，改造思想，发展人民的科学事业，克服科学研究工作中资产阶级思想的良好开端。在工农业生产大跃进的今天，要多快好省地建设社会主义，更要求科学技术力量紧跟上来密切配合。
    但是，对于全面协作的重要意义，当前并不是所有的人都完全理解。那些在科学研究工作上抱有资产阶级思想。保守思想、本位主义的人，往往认为协作太麻烦、不合算、妨碍科学研究，或者认为自然科学研究本身就是联系实际的，科学研究是解决长远的问题，解决今天的问题是生产部门的事，因而不赞成全面协作。
      全面协作是不是麻烦、不合算、妨碍科学研究呢？上海进行协作的无数事实，已经驳倒这种论调，充分说明了全面协作是促进科学事业发展的重要一环。如果说对科学研究有妨碍，那只是妨碍了利用科学研究来达到个人名位的目的。这一点妨碍是好得很，也是科学家自我革命的好办法。自然科学本身是联系实际的。但是，如果关起门来从事研究，不和生产实践密切联系的话，同样会脱离实际的。所谓科学研究是解决长远的问题，解决今天的问题是生产部门的事，这实质上还是脱离实际的思想。有这种思想是不可能达到科学研究为生产服务、配合生产任务的。因为工农业生产是一日千里在发展变化，等到你长远题目研究成功了，也会远远落后于实际的。这不是同样会失去科学研究的作用和价值了吗？
    聂荣臻同志在科学规划委员会第五次会议上的讲话中指出：“科学本身不是目的，为科学而科学是一种极其错误的观点。科学是一定要为生产服务的，在今天就要为生产大跃进服务。如果不明确这一点，我国科学事业就会迷失方向。科学事业如果脱离实际、脱离群众，就会失去巨大的动力，就会暗淡无光”。每一个从事科学研究的人，都应该认清这些原则问题。我们必须赶上当前国家各方面的发展形势，抛弃科学研究工作中形形色色的资产阶级思想，密切地联系实际、联系群众，勇敢地投入到全面协作的行列中去，真正以实际行动，把心交给党，把知识交给人民，彻底改造思想，在红透专深的道路上迈步向前。
