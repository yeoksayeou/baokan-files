    Footprints on the Frosty Plank Bridge
    Cheng Zaozhi

    Our Ninth and Tenth Production Teams of the "Hongguang" Cooperative are tasked with dredging the middle section of the Lujia River. Currently, both teams are just over two hundred cubic meters of earthwork away from completion.

    In the evenings, we light our safety lamps and start night work after dinner. The old north wind, which had been blowing all day, gradually subsided. The river water, which had thawed during the day, began to freeze before dusk. The mud of the riverbed was already frozen solid. There was no need to lay "straw mats" on the rotten mud anymore; we could walk directly on it.

    "Can you cadres sent to the countryside handle it?"

    Around nine o'clock when work ended, Zhou Genhu, the captain of our Tenth Team, propped himself up with his shovel, walked to the safety lamp that had run out of kerosene, raised his frostbitten face, and asked everyone.

    "Just like the cooperative members, none of us have said we can't handle it!" said Comrade Ma Ruilong, one of us. His words represent the opinion of all of us cadres sent to the countryside.

    "That's right, we must strive to complete it early and let the red flag be planted at our construction site from beginning to end!"

    The dredging competition between our Tenth Team and the other teams began ten days ago. Ten days ago, the township assigned our cooperative (ten teams) a task of 18,000 cubic meters of earthwork. When the township party secretary announced this news, he pointed to a stack of red and black flags on the table and said: "Plant the red flag for early and over-completion, and the black flag for failure to complete!"

    There is a small bridge in the middle section of the Lujia River. Our Tenth Team and Ninth Team started a competition; the Tenth Team was east of the bridge, digging westward, and the Ninth Team's end point was also the bridge, digging eastward. The labor force of both teams was about the same. After ten days, our team is about to meet the Ninth Team.

    "How are you doing?"

    The one standing on the bank asking the question was Zhu Xingqing, the captain of the Ninth Team. His question carried a hint of challenge.

    After we packed up our tools and went ashore, our captain Zhou Genhu retorted:

    "How many cubic meters does the Ninth Team still have left?"

    "Two hundred and some! I'm just worried that it won't be finished tomorrow!" Zhu Xingqing said with concern: "It's too late to work at night, I estimate, getting up early, it's good to do thirty or twenty cubic meters!"

    "The Tenth Team plans to get up early tomorrow!" Zhou Genhu said.

    "Good, let's have another competition!"

    "Let's compete!" Zhou Genhu's voice sounded like a bet. "What time do you say?"

    "Seven o'clock?"

    Zhou Genhu laughed with coughs and wheezes: "We're not like you cadres who go to the office, it's already broad daylight at seven o'clock!"

    "Then six o'clock?!"

    "Five thirty!"

    The Ninth Team and we agreed to start work at five thirty tomorrow morning. "Combing your hair and eating a meal counts as a work shift," getting up early and working late means striving to complete the task earlier in terms of time.

    On the way home, Lao Zhou agreed with everyone: "We will get up at five o'clock tomorrow, we must run ahead of the Ninth Team!"

    In the middle of the night, I was awakened by the cold. My two arms, which had been slinging river mud for ten days, ached so badly that I couldn't find a comfortable position, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.

    I put on my cotton coat and went out to relieve myself, and saw a half-moon rising obliquely in the southeast sky. The courtyard was covered with a layer of white frost, and my feet creaked as I stepped on it.

    I went back to sleep. I used a flashlight to shine on my watch. I planned to wake Lao Zhou at five o'clock.

    However, before five o'clock, I heard Lao Zhou coughing in the courtyard. He patted the window lattice with his palm.

    "Get up quickly!"

    "It's only just struck four?!"

    "Fool, there are people like you, ... Look, how good the moonlight is, there are still a few hours until dawn, this is more excellent than working at night with the safety lamp on!"

    While dressing, I and Zhou Genhu went to wake up the cooperative members and cadres.

    Under the moonlight, the frozen land was covered with a layer of white, dense frost. Like heading to the front line, the eighteen of us walked across the plank bridge with heavy steps. As soon as we arrived at the construction site, we heard a burst of chattering. Zhou Genhu groaned:

    "Getting up early and still encountering people who worked overnight!"

    I saw, by the riverbank illuminated by the moon, the Ninth Team had already taken a step ahead of us, trying to do a "small half-shift" before breakfast.

    "Old Zhu, you're early!"

    "You can still catch up!" Zhu Xingqing paused slightly in his work, clearly understanding the meaning of this "early," and said with a smile.

    We are able to catch up. We propped up our shovels, and slippery troughs, and went down to the riverbed. Our hearts are fiery. Stepping on the frozen river mud covered with white frost, no one felt cold.

    The half-moon had only just reached the center of the sky.

    人迹板桥霜
    程造之
    我们“虹光”一社的第九，第十两个生产队，担任陆家河中段的挖泥任务。现在，两个队都还只差二百多土方没有完成了。
    晚上，我们点起保险灯，吃罢晚饭就开夜工。刮了一天的老北风，此时逐渐息了。在日中一度开冻的河水，黄昏不到就结起冰来。河床的泥土已经冻得铁硬。烂泥上再不需要摆“草垫”，脚就可以踏上去。
    “你们下放干部吃得消吗？”
    九点多钟收工的时候，我们的十队队长周根虎，撑着锹，走到用完了火油的保险灯旁边，抬起那张冻红了的脸，在问大家。
    “跟社员们一样，我们谁也没有说吃不消！”我们中间的马瑞龙同志说。他的话是可以代表我们全体下放干部的意见的。
    “不错，我们一定要争取提早完成，让红旗有始有终的插在我们工地上！”
    我们十队和其他队的挖河泥竞赛是十天前开始的。十天前，乡里布置给我们这个社（十个队）一万八千个土方的任务。乡支书宣布这个消息的时候，指着放在桌上的一叠红、黑旗说：“提早和超额完成的插红旗，完不成的插黑旗！”
    陆家河中段有一座小桥。我们十队和九队展开了竞赛；十队在桥的东边，往西挖去，九队的终点也是桥，往东挖。两个队的劳动力差不多。十天下来，我们队快要和九队会师了。
    “你们怎么样？”
    立在岸上问话的，是九队队长朱杏清。他这句话是带有挑战的意思在内。
    我们收拾好工具，上了岸，我们的队长周根虎反问了一句：
    “九队还有多少方？”
    “两百带零！我就是担心它明天完不成！”朱杏清忧愁地说：“开夜工也来不及，我估计，起得早些，也好干它个三二十方哩！”
    “十队打算明天起个早！”周根虎说。
    “好，我们再来比一个赛！”
    “比吧！”周根虎的声气叫人听着简直像打赌。“你说什么时候？”
    “七点钟？”
    周根虎连咳带呛笑了起来：“我们又不像他们干部上办公，七点钟天已大亮了呀！”
    “那么六点？！”
    “五点半！”
    九队和我们约定了，明天早晨五点半开工。“梳头吃饭当一工”，起早落夜多干一些，也就是在时间上争取早点完成任务哩。
    回家的路上，老周同大家约定：“明天五点起床，我们要跑在九队前头！”
    下半夜，我被冻醒了。我的已经甩了十天河泥的两条臂膀，酸痛到无处可放，翻来复去睡不着。
    我披着棉袄出去小解，看见半轮月亮斜升在东南方天上。场院里下了一层白霜，脚踏上去吱吱吱的。
    我睡下了。我用手电照着手表。准备到五点钟就去唤醒老周。
    但是，五点还不到，我听见老周在庭心里在咳嗽。他在窗格上用手掌拍了一下。
    “你快起来！”
    “四点才敲过?！”
    “傻瓜，有你这样的人，……你看，月亮多么好，到天明还有几个钟头，这比晚上点了保险灯来干还出色！”
    我一面穿衣，一面和周根虎分头去唤叫社员和干部们起来。
    月光下，冷冻了的土地上，盖了一层白茫茫的浓霜。我们十八个人像奔赴前线一样，登登登地走过了板桥。我们才走到工地，只听见那里传来一片唧唧喳喳的人声。周根虎呻吟起来：
    “起早还遇着隔夜人呀！”
    只见，被月亮照得通明的河床边，九队的人们已经先我们一步，在那里争取做吃早饭以前的“小半工”了。
    “老朱你们早！”
    “你还来得及追！”朱杏清略停了一下手内的生活，分明懂得这声“早”的意义，笑着说。
    我们是来得及追的。我们撑着锹，滑槽，都下到河床上去了。我们的心内是火热的。踏到盖着白霜的封冻的河泥上，谁也不觉得冷。
    半轮月亮才到天心。
