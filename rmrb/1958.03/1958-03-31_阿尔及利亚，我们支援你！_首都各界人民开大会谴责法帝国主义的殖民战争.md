    Algeria, we support you!
    People from all walks of life in the capital hold a meeting to condemn French imperialist colonial war
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, in response to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference for "Support Algeria Day," people from all walks of life in the capital held a rally tonight at the CPPCC Auditorium to support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence.
    The resolution passed at the meeting stated: "We condemn the French colonialists' recent increase in troops to prepare for a larger-scale suppression of the Algerian people, and their blatant creation of so-called 'no-man's land' on the Algerian-Tunisian border. We believe that the French colonialists' war of aggression in Algeria is not only aimed at permanently conquering and enslaving the Algerian people, but also constitutes a serious provocation and threat to the independence and freedom of the Asian-African peoples and to international peace and security. We demand that the French government unreservedly recognize the independence and national sovereignty of the Algerian people, and end the sinful war and colonial rule!"
    This meeting was initiated and convened by mass organizations such as the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the China Islamic Association, the Sino-Arab United Republic Friendship Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
    The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese Asian Solidarity Committee. In his opening remarks, he said: "In the name of the Chinese people, we once again declare here to the world: The Chinese people are willing to join the Asian-African peoples and the people of the world to resolutely support the Algerian people's just struggle against French colonialism and for national independence!" (The full text of the speech can be found on page four)
    Bao Erhan, Director of the China Islamic Association, then spoke. He narrated the glorious history of the Algerian people's struggle against the colonialists, and he believed that the Algerian people are invincible. The Algerian people will surely achieve national independence.
    Bao Erhan said: In the past one hundred years, Algeria has continuously waged arduous and heroic struggles against foreign invaders. Throughout the vast Algerian land, the flames of resistance against colonialism have been ignited everywhere. In the past three years, the Algerian people have heroically resisted the brutal French colonial army. They have grown in battle and become stronger and stronger. Now, the vast majority of young men and women and patriots have voluntarily joined the "National Liberation Army." The strength of the people has spread to all parts of the country, and they have established their own regime in the liberated areas.
    Bao Erhan emphasized that American and British imperialism has always supported France in carrying out colonial war in Algeria, especially American imperialism, which has consistently supplied French imperialism with a large amount of military supplies and loans to enslave and massacre the Algerian people. Recently, after France bombed the village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef, American imperialism, in the name of "mediation," further interfered in North Africa, attempting to invade Algeria, plunder the rich oil and other large amounts of natural resources in the Sahara Desert, and replace France's colonial position in North Africa. Any new conspiracy of American imperialism will only have a failed future.
    Bao Erhan said: We Chinese people have always loved peace, opposed war, and have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Algerian and African people for national independence. We regard their struggle as our own struggle and their victory as our own victory. We are extremely indignant at the French imperialists' bloody atrocities in massacring the Algerian people, and we express our strong protest. We demand that the French government immediately recognize the independence and national sovereignty of the Algerian people; we demand the immediate release of the five Algerian national leaders, and the immediate release of Jamila Bouhired and other Algerian patriots. We Chinese people also resolutely oppose the American imperialists' support for the French colonialists' massacre of the Algerian people and all conspiracies and crimes of aggression against Arab countries and Africa!
    Bao Erhan said: The current international situation has undergone a decisive change, the forces of peace have overwhelmed the forces of war, the socialist camp has become unprecedentedly strong, and the Asian and African people have become increasingly united. We firmly believe that with the support of the people of the world who love peace and freedom, the Algerian people's struggle for national independence will surely achieve complete victory, and an independent, free, and peaceful Africa will surely appear in the near future!
    When Brahim Ghafa, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, and Adef Daniel, the representative of the Arab People's Congress, were invited to speak at the meeting, sustained and enthusiastic applause rang out in the venue.
    In his speech, Brahim Ghafa, on behalf of the Algerian National Liberation Front, which leads the Algerian revolution, and on behalf of the Algerian people in struggle, paid tribute to the Algerian people's friends—the great Chinese people.
    He narrated the heroic deeds of the Algerian people in striving for independence and freedom. He said: At present, France has used 800,000 armed forces to fight against the free Algerian people. These French troops are mostly equipped with NATO weapons and American planes and fleets. The Algerian people are fighting alone against France and the Western imperialist group of countries. If the Algerian people were fighting against only one French imperialist country, the Algerian liberation war would have ended long ago.
    He said that 600,000 Algerians had been killed, 500,000 had fled to Tunisia and Morocco, and 1.5 million had been forced to flee to the mountains of Algeria, hiding in caves and valleys, eating grass roots and gnawing on bark, and dying of hunger and cold. The French aggressors cannot shirk responsibility for all of this. However, the Algerian people have not shown cowardice in the face of all this, and they are waging an arduous struggle at the cost of their lives. They are full of confidence that victory will eventually be theirs, and the moment of independence will undoubtedly come. Because the will of the people is invincible to any imperialist force in the world. The greater the sacrifice, the stronger the will of the Algerian people. The French aggressors will never overcome the will of the Algerian people. The allies of France cannot overcome the strong will of the Algerian people even if they send troops to Algeria! At this point, he shouted: The Algerian people must live on, and they will surely live on! The Algerian people want independence, and they will surely achieve independence!
    He said that today's Algerian National Liberation Army has 100,000 regular troops and 50,000 commandos, and they are supported by the entire Algerian people. He pointed out that the Algerian National Liberation Army, which grew from nothing, has now become a modern force equipped with new weapons, most of which were obtained from French soldiers in battle.
    Finally, he appealed to the people of the world: Save the people who are suffering catastrophe in Algeria! Let truth, justice, and freedom triumph in Algeria! Support the Algerian revolution with money, materials, propaganda, and diplomatic actions! Severely condemn France, condemn France's policy of exterminating the Algerian people and the Algerian expatriates living in France! Let the Asian and African people actively and effectively support the Algerian people! Let Algeria, standing at the forefront of the Asian and African people's struggle for freedom and independence, crush the aggression of French imperialism! Let the Asian and African people and the peace-loving people of the world condemn and protest against France's continued colonial war in Algeria! Protest against the creation of a new "uninhabited death zone" in the area bordering Tunisia and Algeria, which has 350,000 residents! Let the people of all countries launch a movement against French imperialism! The people of Africa and Asia have a responsibility for the free future of Algeria and for the independence of the Algerian people!
    Adef Daniel, in his speech, paid tribute to the Chinese people on behalf of the Arab People's Congress. He sternly condemned the American imperialists' policy of aggression throughout the world and condemned Israel for being an instrument of imperialist aggression. He said that the main factors threatening world peace are the colonial system and imperialist aggression. Therefore, the peace-loving people of the world must unite and fight together to completely eliminate the colonial system and completely crush imperialist aggression, so as to fundamentally safeguard world peace.
    He said that peace and freedom are inseparable. He called on the Chinese people, the Asian and African people, and the peace-loving people of the world to extend a hand of friendship and support the Algerian people's struggle against the French colonialists. He pointed out that supporting the just struggle of the Algerian people means helping to liberate an oppressed nation, liberating a free, democratic, and independent country that can resolutely defend world peace, consolidating peace in the Asian and African regions, implementing the spirit and resolutions of the Bandung Conference, and implementing the resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference.
    Finally, he quoted Chairman Mao Zedong's words—"The East wind prevails over the West wind"—to end his speech.
    Peng Xiaoyuan, a youth representative and student of Peking University, also spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the 120 million Chinese youth, he extended the most cordial greetings to the Algerian brothers and sisters who are fighting heroically for national independence.
    He said that we Chinese youth firmly believe that the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations cannot be stopped by any force, and the Algerian people will surely win the final victory in the struggle against the heinous colonialism. We Chinese youth are irreconcilable with colonialism. We want to unite with the Algerian people and youth, with the Arab and African people and youth, and with the just people and youth of the world, to fight to the end for the elimination of colonialism, for the complete crushing of the war conspiracy of the imperialist aggression group headed by the United States, and for lasting peace in the world.
    Throughout the meeting, sympathy for the oppressed nations and anger at the colonialists were intertwined. People constantly shouted in Chinese and Arabic: "Salute to the heroic Algerian people!" "Stop the colonial war and oppose imperialist aggression!"
    The meeting finally unanimously adopted a resolution to support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence.
    Tonight, Mao Dun, Zhu Xuefan, Li Dequan, Zhang Xiruo, Chu Tunan, Liao Chengzhi, Xu Guangping, and Hu Lansheng attended the meeting.
    A film was shown after the meeting. (Attached picture)

    阿尔及利亚，我们支援你！
    首都各界人民开大会谴责法帝国主义的殖民战争
    据新华社30日讯　首都各界人民响应亚非人民团结大会关于“声援阿尔及利亚日”的号召，今晚在政协礼堂举行支援阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争大会。
    大会通过的决议中说：“我们谴责法国殖民者最近增调军队准备更大规模地镇压阿尔及利亚人民，并且公然在阿尔及利亚和突尼斯边境制造所谓‘无人区’。我们认为，法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚进行的侵略战争，不仅要永远征服和奴役阿尔及利亚人民，而且也是对亚非各国人民的独立自由和对国际和平与安全的严重挑衅和威胁。我们要求法国政府毫不迟疑地承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和民族主权，结束罪恶的战争和殖民统治！”
    这次大会是由中国亚洲团结委员会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中华人民共和国—阿拉伯联合共和国友好协会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国人民对外文化协会等群众团体发起召集的。
    大会由中国亚洲团结委员会主席郭沫若主持。他在致开会词中说：“我们以中国人民的名义在这里向全世界再一次声明：中国人民愿与亚非各国人民一起，和全世界人民一起，坚决支援阿尔及利亚人民反抗法国殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争！”（讲话全文见第四版）
    中国伊斯兰教协会主任包尔汉接着讲话。他叙述了阿尔及利亚人民同殖民主义者进行斗争的光荣历史，他相信阿尔及利亚人民是不可战胜的。阿尔及利亚人民一定能够获得民族独立。
    包尔汉说：在过去一百多年当中，阿尔及利亚不断地同外国侵略者作艰苦的英勇斗争，在广大的阿尔及利亚土地上，到处燃起了反抗殖民主义的烽火。最近三年来，阿尔及利亚人民英勇抵抗强暴的法国殖民军。他们在战斗中成长，并且越战越强，现在，全国广大男女青年和爱国者都志愿地参加了“民族解放军”。人民的力量已伸展到全国各个地区，并且在已解放的地区建立了自己的政权。
    包尔汉强调地指出，美英帝国主义从来就支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，特别是美帝国主义一贯以大量军火和贷款供给法帝国主义奴役和屠杀阿尔及利亚人民。最近，在法国轰炸萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村庄后，美帝国主义又以“斡旋”为名，进一步干涉北非，企图侵入阿尔及利亚，掠夺撒哈拉沙漠丰富的石油和其他大量天然资源，并要取代法国在北非的殖民地位。美帝国主义任何新的阴谋都只有一个失败的前途。
    包尔汉说：我们中国人民一贯热爱和平、反对战争，一向同情和支持阿尔及利亚和非洲人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。我们把他们的斗争当作自己的斗争，把他们的胜利当作自己的胜利。我们对于法帝国主义屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的血腥暴行感到极大的愤慨，并且表示强烈的抗议。我们要求法国政府立即承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和民族主权；我们要求立即释放阿尔及利亚五位民族领袖、立即释放加米拉·布伊海德和其他阿尔及利亚爱国者。我们中国人民也坚决反对美帝国主义支持法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民和侵略阿拉伯国家和非洲的一切阴谋和罪行！
    包尔汉说：目前国际形势已经发生了决定性的变化，和平力量已压倒了战争势力，社会主义阵营已空前的强大，亚非人民已日益团结，我们坚决相信，在世界爱好和平与自由的人民的支援下，阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争必定会获得彻底胜利，一个独立、自由、和平的非洲，在不久的将来一定要出现！
    阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表卜拉欣·加法和阿拉伯人民大会代表阿德夫·达尼尔应邀在会上先后讲话的时候，会场上响起了持久不息的掌声。
    卜拉欣·加法在讲话中代表领导阿尔及利亚革命的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线、代表斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民向阿尔及利亚人民的朋友——伟大的中国人民致敬。
    他叙述了阿尔及利亚人民争取独立和自由的英雄业迹。他说：目前法国使用了八十万武装部队来同自由的阿尔及利亚人民作战。这些法国军队多半装备着北大西洋公约集团的武器和美国飞机、舰队。阿尔及利亚人民是单独地同时向法国、西方帝国主义国家集团进行斗争的。假如阿尔及利亚人民是同法帝国主义一个国家作战，那阿尔及利亚的解放战争早就结束了。
    他说，有六十万阿尔及利亚人被杀害，五十万人逃亡至突尼斯和摩洛哥，一百五十万人被迫逃到阿尔及利亚的山上，藏在山洞和山谷里，吃草根啃树皮，死于饥寒，这一切法国侵略者是无法脱卸责任的。但是，阿尔及利亚人民在这一切面前并未表示怯懦，他们是在拼着性命进行着艰苦的斗争。他们信心百倍，胜利终究是他们的，独立的时刻无疑地是将会到来的。因为人民的意志是世界上任何帝国主义力量都不能战胜的。牺牲愈大，阿尔及利亚人民的意志愈坚强。法国侵略者绝对不会战胜阿尔及利亚人民的意志。法国的同盟者都把军队开到阿尔及利亚也不会战胜阿尔及利亚人民的坚强意志！这时，他高呼：阿尔及利亚人民要活下去，他们一定会活下去！阿尔及利亚人民要独立，他们一定会获得独立！
    他说，今天的阿尔及利亚民族解放军拥有十万正规军，五万敢死队，他们受到了全体阿尔及利亚人民的支持。他指出，从无到有的阿尔及利亚民族解放军，今天已经成为一支装备着新式武器的现代化部队，他们的武器多半是在战役中从法国士兵手里得来的。
    他最后向全世界人民呼吁：拯救正在阿尔及利亚遭受浩劫的人民吧！让真理、正义和自由在阿尔及利亚取得胜利吧！用金钱、物资、宣传和外交行动来支持阿尔及利亚革命吧！严厉的谴责法国、谴责法国杀尽阿尔及利亚人民和住在法国的阿尔及利亚侨民的政策吧！让亚非人民都来积极有效地支持阿尔及利亚人民吧！让站在亚非人民斗争前线争取自由独立的阿尔及利亚粉碎法帝国主义的侵略！让亚非人民和世界上爱好和平的人民都来谴责、都来抗议法国在阿尔及利亚继续进行殖民战争！都来抗议在拥有三十五万居民的突尼斯和阿尔及利亚交界地区制造新的“无人的死亡地带”！让各国人民掀起反对法帝国主义的运动！非洲和亚洲的各国人民对阿尔及利亚的自由前途、对阿尔及利亚人民的独立负有责任！
    阿德夫·达尼尔在讲话时代表阿拉伯人民大会向中国人民致敬。他严厉谴责美帝国主义在全世界的侵略政策，谴责以色列作了帝国主义的侵略工具。他说，威胁世界和平的主要因素就是殖民主义制度和帝国主义侵略。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民必须团结起来共同奋斗，彻底消灭殖民主义制度，彻底粉碎帝国主义侵略，这样才能从根本上保卫世界和平。
    他说，和平与自由是不可分离的。他呼吁中国人民、亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的人民伸出友谊的手，支援阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民主义者的斗争。他指出，支援阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，就是帮助解放一个被压迫的民族、解放一个能够坚决保卫世界和平的自由、民主和独立的国家，就是巩固亚非地区的和平，就是贯彻万隆会议的精神和决议，就是贯彻亚非人民团结大会的决议。
    他最后引用毛泽东主席的话——“东风压倒西风”——结束了他的讲话。
    青年代表、北京大学学生彭孝渊也在会上讲了话，他以一亿二千万中国青年的名义向为民族独立而英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚兄弟姊妹们致以最亲切的敬礼。
    他说，我们中国青年坚决相信：被压迫民族的解放斗争是没有任何力量所能阻挡得了的，阿尔及利亚人民一定会在反抗万恶的殖民主义斗争中得到最后胜利。我们中国青年是与殖民主义势不两立的，我们要和阿尔及利亚人民和青年，和阿拉伯和非洲人民和青年团结一起，和全世界正义的人民和青年团结一起，为了消灭殖民主义，为了彻底粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团的战争阴谋，为了全世界的持久和平而奋斗到底。
    整个大会会场上，对被压迫民族的同情和对殖民主义者的愤怒交织在一起。人们不断地用中国话和阿拉伯话高呼：“向英勇的阿尔及利亚人民致敬！”“制止殖民主义战争，反对帝国主义侵略！”
    大会最后一致通过了决议，支援阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争。
    今晚，茅盾、朱学范、李德全、张奚若、楚图南、廖承志、许广平和胡兰生等都出席了大会。
    大会结束以后放映了电影。（附图片）
