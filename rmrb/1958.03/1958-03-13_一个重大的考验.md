    A Major Test
    Drought is beginning to appear in some areas. Party and government leading organs in Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and other provinces have already issued calls to launch a water storage and spring irrigation campaign to overcome the spring drought and ensure a bumper wheat harvest. This is an important battle to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year, and it is also a major test. The key to overcoming the spring drought lies in water. Shandong and other places have proposed to develop all underground water sources and block and store all surface water; the masses in various places have also demonstrated revolutionary vigor and wisdom, irrigating with ice, digging stone wells to obtain water, and doing everything possible to find water sources. As long as leading cadres firmly grasp this important measure for increasing production and closely integrate with the masses, it will be possible to quickly extinguish the spring drought!

    一个重大的考验
    部分地区开始出现旱象。山东、山西、陕西、河南等省的党政领导机关已经发出开展蓄水春浇运动，战胜春旱，保证小麦丰收的号召。这是争取今年农业生产大跃进的一个重要战斗，也是一个重大的考验。战胜春旱的关键在于水，山东等地提出了要开发一切地下水源，拦蓄一切地上水的办法；各地群众也发挥了革命干劲和智慧，积冰浇地，打石井取水，千方百计地挖掘水源。只要领导干部紧紧抓住这个增产的重要措施，并且同群众紧密地结合起来，就一定有可能迅速地把春旱扑灭！
