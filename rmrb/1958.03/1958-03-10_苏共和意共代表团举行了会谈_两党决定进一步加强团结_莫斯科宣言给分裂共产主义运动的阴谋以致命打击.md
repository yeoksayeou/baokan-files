Xinhua News Agency, March 9th, Moscow dispatch from TASS on March 9th: The delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, composed of comrades Pospelov and others, visited Italy from February 13th to March 4th this year at the invitation of the Italian Communist Party. The delegation issued a press communique today after returning home.

The communique stated that during its visit to Italy, the CPSU delegation held a series of meetings and talks with the Italian Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Togliatti. The meetings and talks between the Soviet and Italian comrades, conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity and mutual respect, once again confirmed the solid friendship uniting the two fraternal parties on the basis of proletarian internationalism.

The CPSU delegation had the opportunity to learn about the Italian Communist Party's enormous and fruitful organizational work in defending the vital interests and rights of the working people, striving for democratic freedoms, opposing the threat of a new war, striving for peace, and striving for friendship between the Italian people and the peoples of the Soviet Union and all countries of the world. The Italian Communist Party constantly pays attention to strengthening the united action of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance, and to establishing increasingly broad ties between the working class and the urban middle working strata. The Italian Communist Party has achieved good results and accumulated rich experience in completing these basic tasks of the modern workers' movement. The delegation learned about the experience of joint actions by Communist Party members and Socialist Party members in many provinces, which is of great significance in effectively defending the interests of the Italian working class and working people and defending the cause of peace.

The communique said that during the exchange of views between the CPSU delegation and the ICP delegation, it was confirmed that the results of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow in November 1957 and the resolutions adopted at the meeting were of great significance. These two resolutions were a huge ideological and political victory for the world communist and workers' movement, and they dealt a fatal blow to the attempts by reactionaries and opportunists of all stripes to split the communist movement, create chaos in its ranks, and weaken its ideological and political unity.

The communique pointed out that the principles of the main laws of the struggle for socialism in various countries as expounded in the Moscow Declaration on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles and the analysis of the collective experience of the revolutionary parties, and the principle that the national characteristics of each country must be considered when realizing these laws, provide a powerful weapon for the international workers' movement and all Communist Parties to organize the struggle for the democratic development and social progress of their people. The representatives of the two parties unanimously agreed that this principle in the declaration is of particular importance for the smooth work of the Communists, that is, it is necessary to resolutely struggle against revisionism, which is the main danger in the ranks of the international communist movement, as well as dogmatism and sectarianism, in conjunction with the specific conditions of each party. Launching a struggle against the open opportunistic trends and sectarianism in the workers' movement and the communist movement, launching a struggle to realize the party's correct political line, and educating party members in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism in the flames of struggle are the main conditions for ideologically and organizationally strengthening the Marxist-Leninist party.

The communique also said that the delegations of the two parties emphasized the great significance and reality of the Peace Manifesto adopted by the Communist and Workers' Parties of sixty-four countries. The two fraternal parties are doing everything in their power to mobilize the masses to unite around the Peace Manifesto, strive for friendship among the peoples of all countries, establish an effective and universal collective security system, and strive for peaceful coexistence.

The representatives of the two parties unanimously pointed out that there is a close fraternal relationship between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Italian Communist Party, and between them and other fraternal Communist Parties. This relationship is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, mutual respect and equality, which will promote the further unity of the international communist movement.

Both sides emphasized that for the sake of the interests of the international workers' movement and for the sake of peace and socialism, it is of great significance for representatives of Communist parties from various countries to hold frequent direct meetings in order to further strengthen their unity and comradely cooperation. The two parties reaffirmed their determination to continue to develop and strengthen the fraternal relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Italian Communist Party, and between them and all other Communist and Workers' Parties in the future. To this end, the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Italian Communist Party agreed to expand the mutual exchange of information and to regularly study the work experience of the parties through the mutual dispatch of delegations, the exchange of publications and other forms deemed appropriate.

    苏共和意共代表团举行了会谈
    两党决定进一步加强团结
    莫斯科宣言给分裂共产主义运动的阴谋以致命打击
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科9日讯：由波斯伯洛夫等同志组成的苏联共产党代表团，应意大利共产党的邀请，在今年2月13日到3月4日访问了意大利。代表团在回国后在今天发表了访问公报。
    公报说，苏共代表团在访问意大利期间，同以陶里亚蒂同志为首的意大利共产党代表团作了一系列的会见和会谈。苏联和意大利同志在真诚和互相尊重的气氛下进行的会见和会谈，再一次证实了两个兄弟党在无产阶级国际主义基础上团结在一起的巩固友谊。
    苏共代表团有机会了解了意大利共产党在保卫劳动人民切身利益和权利、争取民主自由、反对新战争的威胁、争取和平、争取意大利人民同苏联以及世界各国人民的友谊方面所作的巨大而富有成效的组织工作。意大利共产党经常注意加强工人阶级的统一行动和工农联盟，注意使工人阶级同城市中间劳动阶层建立日益广泛的联系。意大利共产党在完成现代工人运动这些基本任务方面，获得了良好的成绩并且积累了丰富的经验。代表团了解了许多省内共产党员和社会党员联合行动的经验，这种联合行动在有效地保卫意大利工人阶级和劳动人民的利益与保卫和平事业方面有着巨大意义。
    公报说，在苏共代表团和意共代表团交换意见过程中，确认了1957年11月在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议的结果和会议所通过的决议有重要意义，这两项决议是世界共产主义运动和工人运动思想上和政治上的巨大胜利，它们给反动派和形形色色的机会主义者想分裂共产主义运动、在它的队伍中引起混乱以及削弱它的思想上和政治上的团结的企图以致命的打击。
    公报指出，莫斯科宣言在根据马克思列宁主义原则和分析各革命政党集体经验的基础上所阐明的各国争取社会主义斗争的主要规律的原理，和在实现这些规律时必须考虑各国民族特点的原理，给国际工人运动和所有共产党以强有力的武器，来组织争取本国人民的民主发展和社会进步的斗争。两党代表一致认为，宣言中的这一原理对共产党人的顺利工作有特别重要意义，这就是必须结合各党的具体条件对国际共产主义运动队伍中的主要危险——修正主义，以及教条主义和宗派主义进行坚决的斗争。在工人运动和共产主义运动中展开反对公开的机会主义潮流和宗派主义的斗争，展开争取实现党的正确的政治路线的斗争以及在斗争的火焰中以马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义精神教育党员，是从思想上和组织上加强马克思列宁主义政党的主要条件。
    公报又说，两党代表团强调指出六十四国共产党和工人党所通过的和平宣言的重大意义和现实性。两个兄弟党正在尽自己的一切力量去动员群众团结在和平宣言的周围、争取各国人民友好，建立有效的和普遍的集体安全体系，争取和平共处。
    两党代表一致指出，苏联共产党和意大利共产党之间，以及他们同其他兄弟共产党之间存在着紧密的兄弟关系，这种关系建立在马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义、相互尊重和平等的原则的基础之上，这样就会促进国际共产主义运动队伍的进一步团结。
    双方强调指出，为了国际工人运动的利益，为了和平和社会主义的利益，各国共产党代表举行经常的直接会晤，以便进一步加强他们之间的团结和同志式的合作，是具有重大意义的。两党重申它们决心在今后继续发展和加强苏联共产党和意大利共产党之间、以及它们同所有其他共产党和工人党之间的兄弟关系。为此目的，苏联共产党和意大利共产党代表议定扩大相互交流情报和通过互派代表团、交换出版物和通过其他认为妥当的形式经常研究党的工作经验。
