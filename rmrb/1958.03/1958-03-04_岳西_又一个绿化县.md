Yuexi – Another Green County

(Report from Anhui Daily) The people of Yuexi County, Anhui Province, successfully completed the greening of the entire county in forty-five days before the Spring Festival. All 1.25 million mu of suitable barren hills have been planted with trees and afforested, making it another green county in the country.

Yuexi County originally planned to afforest 220,000 mu this year, reaching the targets set in the Agricultural Program within three years, and green the entire county. Since the comprehensive afforestation began in early January, under the leadership of the county party committee and party committees at all levels, through ideological debate and radio propaganda and education, the right-leaning conservative ideas such as "no need for afforestation because there are many trees in the mountains," "no need for seedling cultivation because seeds fly and form forests," and "difficult for trees to survive when planted in winter, and not suitable for afforestation in high mountains" were overcome. The county's afforestation plan was revised four times, increasing from 220,000 mu to 800,000 mu, striving for 1 million mu; the three-year plan to green Yuexi was changed to two years. After the afforestation plan quadrupled, the masses were even more motivated. By February 15th, all 1.25 million mu of suitable barren hills in the county had been planted with trees and afforested, reaching the greening requirements earlier than the revised plan.

During the greening campaign, 83% of the district and township cadres mobilized the masses while taking the lead in afforestation, using their practical actions to drive 54% of the county's population, more than 140,000 people, to participate in the afforestation campaign. Many agricultural cooperatives also specially organized afforestation shock teams, long-distance planting teams, and other afforestation organizations for shock afforestation. Agricultural cooperatives also reasonably resolved the issue of labor compensation for afforestation, stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation and greening, and combining shock afforestation with long-term forest protection management.

Yuexi County also faced difficulties in the greening campaign, such as a shortage of seedlings and seeds. The total number of tree species from the county's state-owned nurseries, mass seedling cultivation, and collected tree species was only enough to afforest more than 65,000 mu. However, Yuexi County relied on the masses, and also collected various tree seedlings for more than 390,000 mu, and more than 32,000 jin of tree seeds, successfully completing the county's greening task.

    岳西——又一个绿化县
    本报讯　安徽日报消息：安徽省岳西县人民用四十五天时间，在春节前夕胜利完成了全县绿化任务。一百二十五万亩宜林荒山，已全部栽树造林，成了全国又一个绿化县。
    岳西县原计划今年造林二十二万亩，在三年内达到农业纲要规定的指标，绿化全县。从1月初开始全面造林以来，在县委和各级党委领导下，通过思想辩论和广播宣传教育，克服了“山区树多不需造林”，“飞籽成林不需育苗”，“冬季栽树难活，大山高山不宜造林”等右倾保守思想以后，全县的造林计划经过四次修改，由二十二万亩增加到八十万亩，争取一百万亩；三年绿化岳西的计划变为二年绿化岳西。造林计划翻两番之后，群众干劲更高。到2月15日，全县一百二十五万亩宜林荒山，已全部栽树造林，又比修订后的计划提前达到绿化要求。
    在绿化运动中，全县83％的区、乡干部一面发动群众，一面带头造林，以自己的实际行动带动了全县54％的人口，十四万多人投入了造林绿化运动。很多农业社并专门组织了造林突击队、远栽队等造林组织，突击造林。农业社还合理地解决造林的劳动报酬问题，激发群众造林绿化积极性，并使突击造林和长远的护林管理结合起来。
    岳西县在造林绿化运动中，也存在着缺苗缺种的困难。全县国营苗圃和群众育苗以及采集的树种，总计仅够造林六万五千多亩。但是，岳西县依靠群众，又搜集了各种树苗三十九万多亩，树种三万二千多斤，顺利地完成全县绿化任务。
