Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: Japanese Peace Committee, National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, and the Executive Committee for Memorial Service for Chinese Prisoner of War Martyrs, held discussions in Tokyo on the 7th regarding the incident of Liu Lianren, a Chinese laborer who was abducted during the war and found by Japanese people after wandering in the wilds of Hokkaido for thirteen years. They jointly decided to launch a national movement within Japan to investigate the responsibility of the Japanese government for the Liu Lianren incident, and to demand that the government provide relief and send Liu Lianren back to China as soon as possible.

Tanaka Toshio, a Socialist Party member of the House of Representatives and permanent director of the Japan-China Friendship Association, will, based on the decision of the Socialist Party Central Executive Committee, question Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on the Liu Lianren incident at the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting of the House of Representatives next week.

Newspapers in Tokyo and Hokkaido have reported on Liu Lianren's long suffering due to the persecution of Japanese militarists. "Hokkaido Shimbun" and "Hokkai Times" also published articles expressing sympathy for Liu Lianren's plight. "Hokkaido Shimbun" pointed out that the order issued by the Japanese government's Immigration Bureau to summon Liu Lianren on suspicion of "illegal entry" is illegal. The newspaper said that it is the Japanese government that should be asking for forgiveness in the Liu Lianren incident.

    日本社团展开国民运动
    要求政府快送刘连仁回国
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本和平委员会、恢复日中邦交国民会议和中国人俘虏殉难者慰灵实行委员会，7日在东京就战时被掳的中国劳工刘连仁在流浪于北海道原野十三年后被日本人发现的事件进行了商谈，并且联合决定要在日本国内展开国民运动，追究日本政府对刘连仁事件应负的责任，并且要求政府尽快救济和送刘连仁回国。
    日本国会众议院的社会党议员、日中友好协会常任理事田中稔男根据社会党中央执行委员会作出的决定，将在下周内在众议院外务委员会会议上就刘连仁事件向日本首相岸信介提出质询。
    东京和北海道的报纸纷纷报道了刘连仁由于日本军国主义者的迫害而长期遭受苦难的事件。“北海道新闻”和“北海时报”并且发表文章，表示同情刘连仁的遭遇。“北海道新闻”指出，日本政府入国管理局以刘连仁“有非法入境嫌疑”而发出的传讯刘连仁的命令是非法的。这家报纸说，在刘连仁事件上应该请求谅解的倒是日本政府。
