    New Discovery
    ——Traditional Chinese Medicine Can Treat Influenza
    Yingshanhong

    In March and April of last year, influenza was widespread throughout the country. According to investigations and research, the possibility of a recurrence this spring still exists. Therefore, the Ministry of Health issued a circular on January 7, urging everyone to be vigilant and take precautions.

    Influenza is different from common colds. When a person's ability to regulate body temperature is not good, and their resistance is weak, a cold weather gives the bacteria that live on the body an opportunity to multiply. Then headaches, fever, cough with phlegm, stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing, and sometimes even a hoarse voice occur. We say this person has caught a cold, or simply caught a cold, or more formally, has the flu. As for influenza, it starts abruptly, with systemic toxic symptoms, headaches, general weakness, and chills. Mild cases pass in one or two days, while severe cases can lead to collapse, coma, and even rapid death. However, recovery is relatively quick, and immunity is developed, unlike common colds that often recur. But influenza is particularly contagious, often becoming an epidemic in a region, an entire country, or even the whole world. During the influenza pandemic of 1918 to 1920, almost half of the world's population was infected, and about fifteen million people died.

    Influenza, like smallpox, measles, chickenpox, and epidemic encephalitis, is caused by viruses. Bacteria are small enough, but viruses are even smaller, visible only under an electron microscope. There are many types of influenza viruses, so there are many types of influenza. After contracting influenza A, one develops resistance to influenza A for one or two years. However, one can still be infected with influenza B, influenza C, or other types. For example, the virus that caused the 1957 influenza pandemic was a new variant of influenza A, so the number of people affected was particularly large.

    Taking random medications is not helpful for influenza. Anti-inflammatory pills or penicillin can treat the pneumonia and meningitis that often accompany influenza, but they cannot treat influenza itself. To this day, there is still no specific drug for treating influenza.

    Recently, "Science Bulletin" published a series of research reports by medical scientist Wang Shanyuan on the prevention and treatment of influenza (note). Of particular interest is the work on treating influenza with traditional Chinese medicine.

    Initially, Professor Wang Shanyuan thought that since some traditional Chinese medicines can inhibit the growth of experimental tumors caused by viruses, they might also have some effect on influenza viruses. So he used mice for experiments, mixing influenza viruses with water extracts of Pulsatilla chinensis, or betel nut, or Dichroa febrifuga, and infecting the mice. As a result, these mice had much less lung damage and survived longer than those infected with influenza viruses but not given traditional Chinese medicine. Among the tested traditional Chinese medicines, betel nut, Dichroa febrifuga, Acorus gramineus, and Scutellaria baicalensis had the most significant effects.

    However, these drugs entered the body together with the influenza virus. If one is already infected with influenza, do these traditional Chinese medicines have any therapeutic effect?

    Professor Wang Shanyuan then conducted some experiments, first infecting mice with influenza, and then adding water extracts of these traditional Chinese medicines to the drinking water for the mice. The results of the experiments proved that betel nut, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Dichroa febrifuga can treat influenza in mice, with particularly evident effects in terms of reduced lung damage and longer survival time. However, the therapeutic effect is related to the concentration of the drug, and combining two drugs does not have a higher therapeutic effect than using one drug alone.

    These traditional Chinese medicines are commonly used and do not pose any danger. If the active substances are extracted, the therapeutic effect may be even higher.

    However, this is currently only at the stage of mouse experiments. It is hoped that hospitals will start clinical trials as soon as possible to benefit patients sooner.

    新的发现
    ——中药可治流行性感冒
    应山红
    去年3、4月间，流行性感冒在全国范围内广泛流行，根据调查研究，今春再度流行的可能性仍然存在。因此，卫生部在1月7日发出通报，要大家提高警惕，防范未然。
    流行性感冒和普通的伤风着凉不同。一个人调节体温的能力不够好，抵抗力差一些，天气一冷，原来在人身上住着的一些病菌趁势繁殖，于是头痛、发热、咳嗽多痰、鼻子不通气、流鼻涕、打喷嚏，有的时候索性连嗓子都哑了；我们就说这个人伤风了，着凉了，说得文一点，说感冒了。至于流行性感冒，起病急，全身有中毒现象、头痛、混身没劲，还发冷，轻的一二天就过去了，重的会虚脱、昏迷，甚至于很快地死亡，可是好得也比较快，而且还产生了免疫力，不像伤风那样常常连着再发。但是流行性感冒特别容易传染，常常成为一个地区、整个国家、甚至全世界的流行病。在1918到1920年的流行性感冒大流行中，全世界人口几乎半数受到感染，死了大约一千五百万人。
    流行性感冒也和天花、麻疹、水痘、流行性脑炎这些病一样，都是病毒引起的。细菌已经够小的了，病毒还要小，只有在电子显微镜下才看得见。流行性感冒病毒有好些种，因此流行性感冒也有好些种。害了一次甲型流行性感冒、一二年内对甲型流行性感冒就有了抵抗力，然而碰上乙型、丙型或是其他类型的流行性感冒，还是会感染的。例如，引起1957年流行性感冒大流行的病毒，是甲型的一种新的变种，所以发病的人特别多。
    害了流行性感冒，乱投药物是没有好处的。消炎片也好，青霉素也好，可以治疗那常常伴随着流行性感冒一起来的肺炎和脑膜炎，但却不能治疗流行性感冒本身。直到现在，还没有治疗流行性感冒的特效药。
    最近，“科学通报”上发表了医学家王善源关于预防和治疗流行性感冒的一系列研究报告（注）。其中特别引人注意的是中药治疗流行性感冒这项工作。
    起初，王善源教授觉得既然有些中药能够抑制那些病毒引起的实验肿瘤的生长，那么它们对于流行性感冒病毒也该有些影响。于是他用小白鼠做试验，把流行性感冒病毒和白头翁，或者槟榔，或者常山这一些中药的水浸出液混合在一起，叫小白鼠感染。结果，这些小白鼠比起那些感染了流行性感冒病毒但是却没有同时接受中药的小白鼠来，肺部损伤的程度要轻微得多，存活的日数也更长久。在试验过的中药当中，数槟榔、常山、九菖蒲、黄芩等的作用最显著。
    然而这些药物是和流行性感冒病毒一起进入身体的。要是已经感染了流行性感冒，这些中药有没有治疗效果呢？
    王善源教授接着又做了些试验，先使小白鼠感染流行性感冒，然后再把这些中药的水浸出液加在饮水里给小白鼠喝。试验结果证明了槟榔、黄芩、常山等能够治疗小白鼠的流行性感冒，效果特别表现在肺部损伤程度轻、存活日数久这些方面。但治疗效果与药物的浓度有关，而且两种药合并使用并不比一种药单独使用的疗效高。
    这些中药都是常用的，不会发生什么危险。如果把有效物质提出来，疗效可能更高一些。
    不过，现在还仅仅止于小白鼠的试验。希望各医院赶紧开始临床试验，早些造福病人。
