    "Selected Poems of Toma"
    Alexandru Toma is one of Romania's most famous poets. Throughout his life, he wrote many poems and also translated many works by world-renowned poets. His most powerful works are collected in the poetry collection "Flame on the Hilltop." These poems were written during the years of Fascism and the Anton Antonescu-Hitler terror (1940-1944). They shouted out the people's cry of resistance and humanity's new hope. After the liberation of Romania, Toma wrote many new works that inspired people to struggle for socialist construction and for peace.
    "Selected Poems of Toma" is the first Chinese translation of his works, including most of his excellent lyrical poems, which can represent the characteristics of his creation. (Xiang)

    “托马诗选”
    亚历山大·托马是罗马尼亚最著名的诗人之一。他一生写了许多诗歌，也翻译了世界著名诗人的许多作品。他的最有力的作品收在诗集“山头的火焰”中。这些诗作是在法西斯主义与安东尼斯古希特勒恐怖的年代（1940—1944）中写成的。其中喊出了人民反抗的呼声，也喊出了人类的新的希望。罗马尼亚解放以后，托马写出了许多新的作品，鼓舞了人们为社会主义建设和为和平而斗争。
    “托马诗选”是他的作品第一次的中译本，包括他的抒情诗中的大部分优秀作品，能够表现他的创作的特色。　（向）
