Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Since the launch of the "Build the Country with Diligence and Thrift, Run the Household with Diligence and Thrift" campaign, a new trend of "comparing diligence, not food and clothing; comparing thrift, not enjoyment" is gradually forming among workers' families across the country.

Many workers' families have proposed that diligence and thrift in managing the household should also learn from, compare with, and catch up with the advanced, and have proposed to carry out competitions. The families of workers at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant in Anhui Province proposed to launch a diligence and thrift household management competition with the families of workers in various units throughout the province, to ensure that 80% of the families of workers in the plant become diligent and thrifty households in 1958. The families of workers in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, proposed to the families of eleven cities in the province that they should strive to save one to one and a half jin of grain and eight to twelve jin of coal per household per month in 1958; to arrange life reasonably, actively develop sideline production, and have more than 80% of the families participate in savings; and to accumulate fertilizer from every household to support agricultural production. The workers and families of Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant jointly guaranteed that in 1958, the attendance rate of all workers in the plant would reach 98%, and the number of diligent and thrifty households would reach 98%. In addition to engaging in sideline occupations such as washing, sewing, raising pigs, and accumulating fertilizer, they would also allocate 1,100 workdays to support the countryside during busy farming seasons. On February 2, many family members and workers dug 5,000 loads of river mud for the farmers.

Participating in sideline production is an important part of workers' families' diligence and thrift in managing the household. According to statistics at the end of 1957, there were more than 250,000 workers' family members participating in sideline production nationwide. Kang Yuying, a family member of a worker at the Shuikoushan Second Factory in Hengyang, grows all the vegetables consumed by her family of five. Since 1955, she has saved 280 yuan on vegetable purchases alone. Zhou Jinxiang, a family member of a worker in Shangrao, Jiangxi Province, used to rely on government subsidies for her family's livelihood. Later, she participated in sideline production such as washing clothes and raising pigs. As a result, she not only overcame the difficulties in her life but also bought 504 yuan of public bonds from 1954 to 1957 and built a new tile-roofed house. Kailuan Tangshan Coal Mine organized workers' families with difficult living conditions to engage in sideline production, and the 44 households that had long relied on government subsidies no longer needed government subsidies.

Workers' families in various places pay attention to saving grain, cotton, coal, and other materials in their activities of diligence and thrift in managing the household. The 6,168 workers' families in six units, including Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, saved 12,860 jin of grain from September to October 1957. In the Kailuan mining area, workers' families put forward the slogan "Save a Thousand Tons of Coal" in 1957. Wang Shuqing, a family member of a worker at Tangjiazhuang Mine, created a "three-purpose stove" (which can cook, warm the kang, and heat water). After its promotion, from April to October 1957 alone, according to statistics from 9,290 households, 3,322 tons of coal were saved. Workers' families have even more varied experiences in saving cloth. The 1,463 workers' families in eight units, including Siliying and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Baoding City, remodeled more than 13,500 old clothes in the fourth quarter of 1957, which, based on an average of five chi of cloth per item, is equivalent to saving more than 67,000 chi of new cloth.

    不比吃穿比勤劳　不比享受比俭朴
    全国职工家属勤成风俭成习
    新华社6日讯　在展开“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”宣传以后，全国各地职工家属中“不比吃穿比勤劳，不比享受比俭朴”的新风气正在逐渐形成。
    许多职工家属提出勤俭持家也要学先进、比先进、赶先进，倡议开展竞赛。安徽省马鞍山铁厂职工的家属提出，要同全省各单位职工家属开展一个勤俭持家的竞赛，保证1958年内全厂职工家属中出现80％的勤俭户。江苏省无锡市的职工家属向全省十一个城市的家属提出倡议，要在1958年内争取做到每户每月节约粮食一斤到一斤半，节约煤八斤到十二斤；做到合理安排生活，积极开展副业生产，80％以上的家属参加储蓄；做到家家积肥，支援农业生产。戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂的职工和家属们一起，保证1958年全厂职工出勤率达到98％，勤俭持家户达到98％，除了从事洗衣、缝纫、养猪、积肥等副业外，还要抽出一千一百个劳动日在农忙时支援农村。2月2日就有很多家属和职工一起为农民挖了河泥五千担。
    参加副业生产，是职工家属勤俭持家的重要内容之一。据1957年底的统计，全国参加副业生产的职工家属已有二十五万多人。衡阳水口山二厂职工家属康玉英，一家五口吃的菜全是她自己种的。1955年以来，仅买菜的钱她就节省了二百八十元。江西省上饶职工家属周金香，原来家里生活经常要靠政府补助，后来她参加了洗衣、喂猪等副业生产，结果不仅克服了生活上的困难，1954年到1957年还买了五百零四元公债，并且新建瓦屋一座。开滦唐山煤矿组织生活困难的职工家属从事副业生产，过去长期依靠政府补助的四十四户都不用政府补助了。
    各地职工家属在勤俭持家活动中都注意节约粮、棉、煤等物资。北京国棉一厂等六个单位的六千一百六十八户职工家属，1957年9月到10月份节约了粮食一万二千八百六十斤。在开滦矿区，1957年职工家属提出了“节约千吨煤”的口号。唐家庄矿的职工家属王淑清创造出一种“三用炉子”（能煮饭、暖炕、温水），推广后，仅1957年4月到10月，据九千二百九十户统计，就节约煤三千三百二十二吨。职工家属们节约布的经验更是五花八门。保定市四里营、邮电局等八个单位的一千四百六十三户职工家属，1957年第四季度共拆改旧衣服一万三千五百多件，按平均每件五尺布计算，等于节约新布六万七千多尺。
