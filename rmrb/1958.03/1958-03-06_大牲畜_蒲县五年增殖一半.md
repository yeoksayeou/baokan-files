    Large Livestock
    Puxian County Increases by Half in Five Years
    During the first Five-Year Plan, large livestock in Puxian County, Shanxi, experienced a leap in development. By 1957, the county's various types of large livestock had grown to 15,279 heads, averaging one head of large livestock for every two farmers. This figure represents an increase of 111.3% compared to the early post-liberation period, a 10.8% increase compared to before collectivization (1955), and a 58.1% increase compared to the first year of the first Five-Year Plan (1952). The annual increase over the five years was 7%. Due to the development of large livestock, the cultivated land burdened by each draft animal was reduced from 34.8 mu to 27.7 mu. The increase in large livestock not only increased the power and fertilizer for agricultural production but also greatly increased the sideline income of the masses. In the past five years, the income from sales, slaughter, and hides alone amounted to 392,300 yuan. Based on the number of agricultural households in 1957, the average per household was 40.01 yuan.

    大牲畜
    蒲县五年增殖一半
    在第一个五年计划期间，山西蒲县的大牲畜获得飞跃发展。到1957年，全县各种大牲畜已发展到一万五千二百七十九头，平均每两个农民有一头大牲畜。这个数字比解放初期增长111.3％，比合作化前
  （1955年）增长10.8％，比第一个五年计划第一年（1952年）增长58.1％。五年中每年递增7％。由于大牲畜的发展，每头役畜负担的耕地由三十四亩八分减为二十七亩七分。大牲畜的增多，不仅给农业生产增加了动力和肥料，而且大大提高了群众副业收入。五年来仅出售、屠宰、皮毛三项收入就有三十九万二千三百多元，以1957年农业户数计算，每户平均四十元零一角。
