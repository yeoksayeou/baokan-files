Grasp Advanced Experiences to Create Typical Models, Grasp Backwardness to Break Through Weak Links
"Two Dragons" Drive the Entire Factory
The Method of Cultivating Experimental Plots Has a New Development in Harbin Vehicle Factory

(Reported by Heilongjiang Daily) The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, based on the characteristics of enterprise production, emulated the experience of cultivating experimental plots in rural areas and creatively implemented the leadership method of "two dragons."

The "two dragons" leadership method of this factory involves selecting a backward but crucial foundry workshop and an advanced freight car workshop from each independent production workshop in the factory. One or two leading cadres are assigned to each process in these two workshops to form "two dragons," participating in production and leading production. They break through production bottlenecks in the "backward dragon" and summarize work experience in the "advanced dragon" to drive the entire factory. This factory also calls the "two dragons" "grasping the two ends to drive the middle." They stipulated that Wednesday is a "no-meeting day." Starting from February 5th, every Wednesday, more than 20 leading cadres, including the factory director, Party secretary, and section chiefs, go to each process of these two workshops, participating in production in the morning and collectively helping the workshops solve production problems in the afternoon.

The "two dragons" leadership method has enabled the factory's leading cadres to shed their bureaucratic airs and change their work styles. Many production problems have been resolved in a timely manner. Factory Director Zhang Hongshu participated in labor production in the molding process of the foundry workshop and found that workers used great force to knock the models when removing the arch frame pillars, which increased the sand mold area. He asked the workers, and the workers replied, "This model is not standard; the top is smaller than the bottom. If we don't knock it hard, we can't remove the model. Suggestions are never resolved!" Factory Director Zhang personally carried the model to the workshop office and gathered the model workers, technicians, and workshop leaders to jointly study and solve the problem. Because the model was metal, it needed to be repaired by the machine shop. Factory Director Zhang called the director of the machine shop and set a deadline for the repair. The workers happily said, "This problem wouldn't have been solved so quickly if the factory director hadn't come!" The "two dragons" leadership method has also enabled leading cadres to strengthen their ties with the masses and specifically strengthen political and ideological work.

Through the "two dragons" leadership method, this factory has grasped the two experimental workshops, advanced and backward, and driven the great leap forward in production throughout the factory. In the past, the low output and poor quality of the foundry workshop often affected the production of other workshops. When formulating this year's production leap forward plan, each workshop was worried that the foundry workshop would not be able to supply parts. Now that the leaders have gone deep down, they have helped discover more than 30 problems and solved more than 20, greatly inspiring the masses. Many production bottlenecks have been broken through. In the past, the foundry workshop rarely completed its tasks on time, but in early February, it completed half a month's tasks, and the quality of cast steel also dropped from a scrap rate of 20% to 5%, and the number of rejects dropped from 26% to 10%, fundamentally reversing the situation where it accounted for four-fifths of the factory's scrap loss last year. This has greatly enhanced the confidence of other workshops in making great leaps forward. The freight car workshop used to be afraid that the foundry workshop's parts would not keep up, but now that they can keep up, they proposed to reduce the number of days for repairing cars in the factory from 15 days to 7.5 days. The machine shop used to be afraid that the foundry workshop's castings had large machining allowances, which affected cutting efficiency. Now that the machining allowances of the castings have been reduced, this workshop has also improved the cutting efficiency of casting machining. The factory's total output value plan will therefore be increased from 30 million yuan to 45 million yuan to 50 million yuan.

    抓先进创造典型经验　抓落后突破薄弱环节
    “两条龙”带动全厂
    种试验田的方法在哈尔滨车辆厂有了新发展
    本报讯　据黑龙江日报报道：哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂根据企业生产的特点，仿效农村种试验田的经验，创造性地实行了“两条龙”的领导方法。
    这个厂的“两条龙”的领导方法，是在全厂各个独立生产车间中，找出一个落后的但是全厂心脏的翻砂车间和一个先进的货车车间，在这两个车间的每个工序固定安插上一、二名领导干部，组成“两条龙”，参加生产领导生产。他们在“落后龙”中突破生产关键，在“先进龙”中总结工作经验，以推动全厂。这个厂把“两条龙”也叫作
  “抓住两头，带动中间”。他们规定星期三为“无会议日”。从2月5日开始，每到星期三，厂长、党委书记、科长等二十多名领导干部就分别下到这两个车间的每个工序，上午参加生产，下午集体帮助车间解决生产问题。
    “两条龙”的领导方法，使这个厂的领导干部打掉官气，改变了工作作风。许多生产中的问题得到及时解决。厂长张鸿树在翻砂车间造型工序参加劳动生产，发现工人在起拱架柱模型时，使挺大劲敲打模型，扩大了砂型面积。他问工人，工人回答：“这个模型不标准，上边比下边小，不使大劲敲打，起不出模型来。提意见也得不到解决！”张厂长就亲自把模型扛到车间办公室，把模型工人、技术员、车间领导干部找到一起共同研究解决。因为模型是金属的，还需要机械车间给修理，张厂长就打电话给机械车间主任，限期给修理出来。工人高兴地说：“这个问题不是厂长来，还不知得啥时候解决呢！”“两条龙”的领导方法，也使领导干部密切了同群众的联系，并且具体地加强了政治思想工作。
    这个厂通过“两条龙”的领导方法，抓住先进和落后两个试验车间，带动了全厂的生产大跃进。过去，由于翻砂车间产量低、质量差，常常影响其他车间的生产。在制订今年生产跃进规划时，各车间都担心翻砂车间供应不上配件。现在，领导深入下去以后，帮助发现了三十多个问题，解决了二十多个问题，群众大为振奋，不少生产关键已被突破。过去翻砂车间从来很少按时完成任务，而2月上旬却完成了半个月的任务，铸钢质量也由原来废品率20％降低到5％，次品由26％降低到10％，从根本上扭转了去年占全厂废品损失五分之四的局面。这样，便大大增强了其他车间大步跃进的信心。货车车间过去怕翻砂车间配件跟不上，现在能够跟上了，他们就提出要把修车在厂日数，由十五天缩到七天半；机械车间过去怕翻砂车间的铸件加工余量大，影响切削效率，现在铸件加工余量已经缩小，这个车间也提高了铸件加工的切削效率。全厂产值计划因此将由三千万元提高到四千五百万元至五千万元。
