Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 28th: The Hubei Province and Wuhan City literary and art circles' Great Leap Forward Conference on Creation, which lasted for three days, concluded today. After discussions and research by various professional groups, the conference finalized literary and artistic creation plans.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report at the conference on issues such as the leap forward in literary and artistic work, literary and artistic creation, literary and artistic teams, literary and artistic criticism, and the reform of literary education. Zeng Dun, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee, and Yu Heiding, Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education, also spoke at the meeting.

The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Writers Association plans that, within two years, works with workers and peasants as their subject matter and reflecting real life will account for 60% of the total number of works in various forms. According to the plan, eighty-seven professional theater troupes in Hubei Province and Wuhan City will go to the mountains, countryside, factories, and military units this year, as well as tour the cities, bringing performances to people's doorsteps, with the goal of ensuring that everyone in the province can see a play at least once this year. The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Musicians Association will devote great effort this year to carrying out mass singing activities, bringing music to the countryside, streets, parks, and tea houses, with cultural centers and stations taking responsibility for specific areas, so that every district in Wuhan has an amateur music school, every factory has a singing team, every street has a singing team, every neighborhood has singing, and new songs are taught every month. The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Artists Association will also cooperate with the provincial and municipal cultural departments to establish art groups in every factory and club in Wuhan this year, with galleries in every district, and hold more than seventy amateur art schools, training classes, and research studios to cultivate worker-peasant authors.

During the conference, many people formulated individual plans that were both red and expert. Wang Xiazhou, a gray-haired traditional Chinese painter, painted fifty paintings in the past two years. This year, while ensuring quality, he plans to paint two hundred, and achieve a depth of expertise while being thoroughly red within ten years. Writers, artists, and amateur literary and art workers who returned to the countryside to engage in labor training and creative activities expressed in their speeches that they would adhere to the principle of drawing materials locally, creating locally, and performing locally in their creative activities, and use the typical figures and deeds of workers and peasants to serve the leap forward in production.

    多写工农兵　多演工农兵
    湖北文艺界讨论文艺普及问题
    据新华社武汉28日电　湖北省、武汉市文学艺术界举行的为期三天的创作跃进大会，今天闭幕。会议经过各专业小组的讨论研究，分别定出文艺创作规划。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬，就文艺工作的跃进、文艺创作、文艺队伍、文艺批评和文学教学改革等问题，在会上作了报告。中共湖北省委宣传部长曾惇、武汉市委第一书记宋侃夫、文教部副部长于黑丁也到会讲了话。
    各协会在会上宣布的创作规划着重强调了文艺创作活动的普及工作，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方针，多写工农兵，多演工农兵，大力辅导和培养工农兵业余文艺创作者。中国作家协会武汉分会计划在两年内创作各种形式的作品总数中，以工农为题材反映现实生活的作品占60％。根据规划，湖北省、武汉市八十七个职业剧团，今年将上山下乡下厂下部队和到城市巡回演出，把戏送上门去，要求作到今年全省平均每人都能看到一次戏。中国音乐家协会武汉分会今年将花很大的力量开展群众性的歌咏活动，把音乐送到农村、街道、公园、茶馆里去，由各文化馆、站分片包干，使武汉区区有业余音乐学校，厂厂有歌咏队，街街有歌咏队，里弄有歌声，月月教新歌。中国美术家协会武汉分会也将配合省市文化部门，在今年内使武汉各工厂、各俱乐部有美术小组，每区都有画廊，并举办七十多个业余美术学校、训练班和研究室，培养工农作者。
    大会期间，不少人订出了又红又专的个人规划，须发斑白的国画家王霞宙过去两年画了五十张画，今年在保证质量的基础上画二百张，十年内达到红透专深。回农村进行劳动锻炼和创作活动的作家、艺术家和业余文艺工作者们在发言中，都表示在自己的创作活动中，坚持就地取材、就地创作和演出的方针，用工人、农民的典型人物和事迹，为生产跃进服务。
