    The saying goes, "It is rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times." It's even rarer and more remarkable for someone over ninety to be in good health, perform on stage, and even play new roles. The Soviet People's Artist Yablochkina is such an actress. This beloved and famous actress just celebrated her ninetieth birthday last year, but her creative enthusiasm has not diminished at all. She is now preparing to participate in the play adapted from the famous British writer Thackeray's novel "Vanity Fair," playing Miss Crawley in it.

    Yablochkina has played more than four hundred roles, creating characters from the works of many famous writers such as Shakespeare, Griboyedov, Gogol, and Ostrovsky. Among them, roles such as Karenina in Tolstoy's "The Living Corpse" and Varvara in Korneichuk's "Bogdan Khmelnitsky" have won high praise from Soviet audiences. Therefore, Yablochkina has not only won the Stalin Prize for Literature and Art but has also been awarded three Orders of Lenin.

    Yablochkina's many years of stage life have earned her countless rounds of applause from the audience. However, the first applause she won in her stage life was unusual. Why? It turned out that when she was six years old, she participated in a play for the first time, playing a boy. After saying a few lines, she forgot her lines. The prompter tried his best to remind her, but she loudly said, "Please don't shout, I know how to act myself!" The hall erupted in enthusiastic applause. This was the first applause she won from the audience. This applause encouraged her, and she quickly remembered her lines.

    In addition to working in the Maly Theatre, Yablochkina also undertakes a lot of social work. For example, for more than forty years, she has been leading the All-Russian Theatrical Society, making great contributions to theatrical work. (Jun)

    九十一岁的女演员
    俗语说得好：“人生七十古来稀”，至于九十多岁的人能够身体很健壮，登台演戏，而且还扮演新的角色，那更是凤毛麟角，极为难得的了。苏联人民演员雅布洛奇金娜就是这样一位演员。这位受到人民爱戴的著名演员，去年才庆过了九十大寿，但是她的创作热情却丝毫不曾减低，现在她正准备参加根据英国名作家萨克雷的名著“名利场”改编的话剧演出，扮演剧中的克劳莱小姐。
    雅布洛奇金娜已经扮演过四百多个角色。创造了莎士比亚、格里包耶道夫、果戈里、奥斯特洛夫斯基等许多著名作家的剧作中的角色。其中像托尔斯泰的“活尸”中的卡列宁娜、考?楚克的“波哥丹·赫美尼茨基”中的瓦尔瓦拉等，都博得了苏联观众的高度评价。因此，雅布洛奇金娜不仅曾获得过斯大林文艺奖金，而且还荣获过三枚列宁勋章。
    雅布洛奇金娜多年的舞台生活，已不知博得了观众多少赞美的掌声了。但是她的舞台生活第一次赢得的掌声，却是不寻常的。为什么呢？原来当她六岁时，第一次参加话剧演出，扮演一个男孩子。上场后说了几句话她就忘记了台词。提词的人尽力提醒她。但是她却大声说：“请不要大声地说了，我自己知道怎么演！”大厅中暴发了热烈的掌声。这是她第一次博得的观众的掌声。这次掌声鼓励了她，使她很快地想起了台词。
    雅布洛奇金娜除去在小剧院工作以外，还担任大量的社会工作。例如，四十多年来，她一直领导着全俄戏剧协会，为戏剧工作贡献了很大力量。　（君）
