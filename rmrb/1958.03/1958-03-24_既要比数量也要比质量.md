    Emphasizing Both Quantity and Quality
    Kong Rui
    In the rectification campaign, the big-character poster has developed into a very important form of promoting socialist democracy. Thanks to the full mobilization of the masses, the number of big-character posters in various cultural and educational departments has greatly increased recently. Some schools, after conducting mobilization, have produced tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of big-character posters in a single day, creating a favorable momentum for the "double-anti" movement.
    Some units, in order to promote the rapid development of the "double-anti" movement and quickly expose various problems, launched a surge of writing big-character posters in the early stages of the movement, which was originally a good thing. However, in some individual places, due to the lack of full mobilization of the masses and the failure to properly eliminate various ideological concerns, there has been a phenomenon of a large quantity of big-character posters but low quality. Some big-character posters do not address the "five airs" at all. This inevitably fails to achieve the goal of fiercely attacking conservatism and sweeping away the "five airs."
    At present, as the movement deepens, the requirements for big-character posters should also change with the situation, emphasizing both quantity and quality. Quantity and quality are related to each other. Without a certain quantity, it is impossible to create a vast momentum for the "double-anti" movement, expose all the dirt, and it is also impossible to improve quality on the basis of quantity. However, without a certain quality guarantee, it is impossible to deeply expose the essence of the problems, and quantity will become a mere formality. Here, the key issue lies in the leadership's determination for rectification and the extent of its mobilization of the masses. When a research unit was first mobilized, the youth shock brigade was required to guarantee writing ten big-character posters per person. Because the problems were not yet fully exposed at the time and the team members still had ideological concerns, writing ten big-character posters was difficult. After ideological obstacles were cleared, more and more big-character posters were written, and the problems were exposed more and more deeply. When everyone was required to guarantee completing forty big-character posters, they did not feel it was difficult. It can be seen that the quantity and quality of big-character posters are complementary. We must emphasize both quantity and quality. Paying attention only to quantity and not to quality is wrong. Conversely, paying attention only to quality and not to quantity will prevent the masses from knowing everything and saying everything, which is also wrong.

    既要比数量也要比质量
    孔瑞
    在整风运动中，大字报已发展成为发扬社会主义民主的一种很重要的形式。由于充分发动了群众，最近文教各部门的大字报数量大大增加。有些学校在进行动员以后，一日之间，大字报就有几万张、几十万张，为双反运动造成了有利的声势。
    有些单位为了推动双反运动的迅速开展，使各种问题迅速地揭发出来，在运动初期掀起了比写大字报的热潮，这本来是一件好事。但是，在个别地方，由于群众没有充分发动，各种思想顾虑还没有很好解除，也曾出现了大字报数量虽多质量不高的现象。有些大字报言不及“五气”。这样必然不能达到猛攻保守，横扫“五气”的目的。
    目前，运动正在深入，对于大字报的要求，也应随着形势的变化，既要比数量，也要比质量。数量和质量是有一定的联系的。没有一定的数量，就不能造成双反运动的浩大声势，把所有的污垢都揭露出来，也不可能在数量的基础上提高质量。但是，没有一定的质量保证，也不能深刻地揭露问题的本质，而使数量流于形式。在这里，关键问题还在于领导对整改的决心和对群众的发动的程度。有一个研究单位刚动员时，要求青年突击队每人要保证写十张大字报。由于当时问题没有摊开来，队员思想还有顾虑，写十张大字报是有困难的。在思想障碍扫除以后，大字报愈写愈多，问题愈揭愈深，每人要求保证完成四十张大字报时，大家并不感到困难。由此可见，大字报的数量和质量是相辅相成的，我们既要比数量也要比质量。只注意数量不注意质量是不对的。反之，只注意质量，不注意数量，群众就不能知无不言，言无不尽，那也是不对的。
