    Father-Daughter Bet
    Wu Jianwen

    On February 8th, the Party General Branch of Desheng Township, Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, called on Party members, League members, and activists building the reservoir to show revolutionary drive and make a pushcart each in one evening. Liu Qingrong, a sixteen-year-old Communist Youth League member, immediately consulted with her father after hearing this news. Her father, who also worked at the construction site, burst into laughter after hearing his daughter's words, saying, "Little girl, I'll bet you, if you can make a cart overnight, I'll buy you a pound of meat every day." Liu Qingrong said, "Okay, we'll see tomorrow!"

    She ran six or seven *li*, and it was already starry when she got home. She used a flashlight to cut down two small trees from the side of the vegetable garden, borrowed a bamboo knife and chisel from a neighbor, and invited Grandpa Wang Bingkun to help with the design. After a long time of designing, the two small trees could only be used for the handles, and there was no material for making the wheels. Later, she found a chopping board that had not been used for many years, sawed it into a circle, and made a hole in the middle to make a wheel. She worked diligently until the rooster crowed, and finally made a pushcart.

    Before dawn, she ran and pushed the empty cart to the construction site. Everyone applauded when they saw it, shouting, "Liu Qingrong, tell your father to buy you meat!" Her father took the cart and tried it, and said in surprise, "The youth educated by Chairman Mao are promising. I really didn't expect you to make a cart overnight."

    In this way, in less than four days, the baskets and carrying poles used for carrying soil on the construction site were all replaced by more than 1,470 new carts. (Attached picture)

    父女打赌
    吴建文
    2月8日，湖北省新洲县得胜乡党总支号召，要建设水库的党团员和积极分子拿出革命干劲，每人用一个晚上的时间做一辆推土车。十六岁的女共青团员刘青蓉听到这一消息后，连忙找她的父亲商量。她父亲也在工地作工，听完女儿的话后，就哈哈大笑起来，说：“小女伢，我同你打赌，你要是一夜能赶做一辆车子，我每天买一斤肉给你吃。”刘青蓉说：“好吧，明天再看！”
    她跑了六、七里路，赶到家时已是满天星斗了。她打着电筒，到菜园边砍回两棵小树，向邻居借来篾刀、凿子，就请来了王炳坤老大爷帮助设计。设计了很久，两棵小树只能做车把，做车轮的材料还没有着落。后来找来了一块多年未用的砧板，把它锯圆，中间打个眼，才做了个车轮。叮叮梆梆地一直做到鸡叫，终于把一辆推土车做成功了。
    天不见亮，她就飞跑着把空车推到工地。大家一看，都拍手欢呼：“刘青蓉，快叫你爸爸给你吃肉！”她父亲接过车子试了试，也惊喜地说：“毛主席教养的青年有作为，我真没料到一夜能做辆车子。”
    就这样，不到四天，工地上挑土用的畚箕、扁担，就全部由一千四百七十多辆新车子代替了。（附图片）
