According to a report in Shanghai's Liberation Daily, the seventeen natural scientists who advocated to the whole country to strive to become both red and expert, and even redder and more expert, are working hard to transform themselves and accelerate the realization of their "personal plans" with practical actions.

Biochemist Wang Yinglai spread out the thirty big-character posters that criticized him on the table, considered them carefully, wrote a rectification plan, and focused on examining his petty-bourgeois sentimentality. Now he is "not only in charge of professional work, but also must be in charge of ideology," and he has also put forward sharp criticisms to senior researchers face-to-face. The Nutritional Physiology Research Group led by plant physiologist Tang Yuwei had been consistently disunited in the past. This time, he was determined to change his "patriarchal" leadership style and take the mass line as the first step in realizing his red and expert plan, thus resolving the five-year-old knot within the group. The literature report meeting, which had been interrupted for more than a year due to disunity, will now continue, and Tang Yuwei has decided to be the first to give a report.

Luo Zongluo, director of the Institute of Plant Physiology, posted a big-character poster about the institute's five-year plan on the second day of the "double anti" movement. This old scientist, who is already in his sixties, has not been in the laboratory for a long time, but now he personally leads the rice work coordination group and has decided to work in the laboratory three days a week. Wang You, deputy director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry, is the deputy director of the Shanghai Antibiotic Regional Committee. During the double anti movement, he deeply felt that he had not paid enough attention to the extraction of new antibiotics in the past, and now he is determined to draw a group of people from the institute to engage in the chemical screening of new antibiotics. At the same time, he took the initiative to contact relevant departments to promote the establishment of the livestock antibiotic group. The Institute of Materia Medica, led by pharmacologists Zhao Chengzha and Gao Yisheng, also decided to strengthen the research on drugs for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis and other diseases, and strive to initially screen 500 to 1,000 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine within two or three years to find effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis and other diseases. In the past four years, only more than 100 kinds have been screened.

In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, researcher Shen Shanjiong and another senior researcher, Jiao Ruixin, discussed and cancelled the plan to establish a fermentation room, saving a large amount of funds for the country. Shen Shanjiong specially went to the Pharmaceutical Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry to negotiate and help them establish a laboratory as a base for further cooperative research on antibiotics.

### 向全国倡议的上海十七位科学家  努力实现个人规划

    向全国倡议的上海十七位科学家
    努力实现个人规划
    据上海解放日报报道　向全国提出争取成为又红又专、更红更专的倡议的十七位自然科学家，正在努力进行自我改造，用实际行动加速“个人规划”的实现。
    生物化学家王应睐把大家批评他的三十张大字报，一张张摊在桌上，仔细考虑后，写出整改方案，并着重检查了自己的小资产阶级的温情主义。现在他是“不仅管业务，也得管思想”，对高级研究人员也当面提出了尖锐的批评。植物生理学家汤玉玮领导的营养生理研究组，过去一直不团结，这次他下定决心改变“家长式”领导作风，走群众路线，作为自己实现红专规划的第一步，因而解开了组内五年来的疙瘩。由于不团结而中断了一年多的文献报告会，现在也要继续举行，汤玉玮并决定第一个做报告。
    植物生理研究所所长罗宗洛在“双反”运动开始的第二天就贴出了全所五年规划的大字报。这位年已花甲的老科学家，已经较长时期未进实验室，现在亲自领导水稻工作协调小组，并决定每周三天到实验室工作。有机化学研究所副所长汪猷是上海抗生素地区委员会的副主任委员。在双反运动中，他深感过去对提取新抗生素重视不够，现在决心在所内抽调一批力量从事新抗生素的化学筛选工作。同时，他主动与有关部门联系，推动畜用抗生素小组的成立。药物学家赵承嘏、高怡生领导的药物研究所，也决定加强防治血吸虫病等疾病药物的研究，并争取在两三年内初筛五百到一千种中药，来为防治血吸虫病等疾病寻找有效的药物。这种工作在过去四年中只筛了一百多种。
    在反浪费反保守运动中，研究员沈善炯和另一高级研究人员焦瑞身商议，取消了建立发酵室的计划，为国家节约一大笔资金。沈善炯曾特地到化工部医药工业研究所，商定帮助他们建立实验室，作为进一步合作研究抗生素的基地。
