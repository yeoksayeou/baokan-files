    Random Thoughts After Reading "Anecdotes of the Qing Court"
    Ke An
    Yu Rongling's "Anecdotes of the Qing Court" was serialized in the "New Observer" magazine and then published by Beijing Publishing House. The book includes many photos of Empress Dowager Cixi, Emperor Guangxu, and the author, and several illustrations of court life. The copyright page states that the first edition was printed in 72,000 copies!

    Yu Rongling, the author of "Anecdotes of the Qing Court," served as a lady-in-waiting before Empress Dowager Cixi. If the author's memories could truthfully depict the decadence, corruption, insidiousness, and tyranny of Cixi, the highest ruler of the late Qing Dynasty, it would be a beneficial undertaking, helping readers to understand the historical face of this period more specifically and intimately. However, after reading "Anecdotes of the Qing Court," we cannot help but feel disappointed. Not only does it fail to provide readers with anything beneficial, but it is also likely to cause ideological confusion for some.

    Anyone with a little common sense about modern Chinese history knows that the decade from 1895 to 1907 was one of the darkest periods in modern Chinese history. The imperialist powers invaded China one after another, stirring up a frenzy of land grabs. China was in a state of being slaughtered and divided. At the same time, imperialist aggression and the decay of feudal rule also stimulated the awakening of the Chinese nation. The broad masses of the people and people with lofty ideals rose up to resist aggression and defend the country, carrying out heroic struggles. At that time, the main culprit who dragged the Chinese people into the abyss of suffering and brought national humiliation to China was Cixi, who represented the decadent rule of the Qing Dynasty, betrayed the country to foreigners, deceived the people at home, and was tyrannical and brutal. Even now, when we review this period of history, we cannot help but hate Cixi and her gang of traitors.

    However, what did the author actually record in her more than 70,000-word memoir? It turns out to be a tedious description of eating, watching operas, celebrating festivals, offering birthday greetings, visiting gardens, holding banquets, painting portraits, the costumes of palace maids and eunuchs, the attire of Cixi and her ladies-in-waiting, the cumbersome etiquette of the court... and so on. It seems that China at that time was not in a precarious situation, but a picture of peace and prosperity; Cixi herself was not so decadent and muddled, but merely a leisurely and luxurious noblewoman; it seems that she was not a vicious and experienced leader of the feudal ruling class, but an honest person who could not be helped. The author uses superficial descriptions of palace life details to cover up the real political issues, and uses some colorful powder to blur the ugly face of this sinful abyss. For example, the anti-imperialist patriotic movement of the Yihetuan, which shocked the world (the author calls it the "Boxer Rebellion!"), is only mentioned in a few hundred words. The anti-imperialist struggle content of this movement is not mentioned at all, only the life of Cixi and a small group of people fleeing to Xi'an in a panic is written, and not a word is mentioned about their crimes of looting, accepting bribes, and extorting along the way. In short, readers cannot see the crimes of Cixi and her gang of acting perversely, flattering foreigners, and selling out the country from "Anecdotes of the Qing Court." It is not an exaggeration to say that "Anecdotes of the Qing Court" is a bad book.

    We have reason to ask "New Observer" magazine, why did you use so much space to serialize this "Anecdotes of the Qing Court"? Beijing Publishing House, why did you publish such a book in large quantities? Perhaps Beijing Publishing House also felt that there was a problem with publishing this book, so they attached an "afterword" to the book to make up for the shortcomings of the original book! But the effect is probably very small.

### “清宫琐记”读后杂谈

    “清宫琐记”读后杂谈
    柯庵
    裕容龄写的“清宫琐记”，在“新观察”杂志上连载之后，又由北京出版社出版了。书前附有慈禧、光绪以及作者等人的多幅照片，书内附有多幅宫庭生活的插图。版权页上印着初版印数是七万二千册！
    “清宫琐记”的作者裕容龄是担任过慈禧的御前女官的，如果通过作者的回忆，能够如实地写出清朝末日的最高统治者——慈禧的昏庸腐朽、阴险专横，这原是一件有益的工作，它可以帮助读者更具体地、更亲切地了解这一时期的历史面目。但是，当我们读了“清宫琐记”以后，却不能不感到失望。它不仅不能给予读者什么有益的东西，而且很可能给某些读者带来思想混乱。
    凡是对中国近代历史稍有常识的人，谁都知道，从1895年到1907年这十多年当中，是中国近代史上最黑暗的时期之一。帝国主义列强纷纷侵入中国，搅起了割地狂潮，当时的中国正处在被宰割、被瓜分的状态。同时帝国主义的侵略和封建统治的腐烂，也激发了中国民族的觉醒，广大人民和有志之士，奋发图强，起来反抗侵略，保种卫国。进行了英勇的斗争。在那个时候把中国人民拖入水深火热的境地，使中国丧权辱国的主要祸首，正是那个代表清代腐朽统治对外卖国，对内欺骗，专横残暴的慈禧。至今当我们再来温习这段历史的时候，还忍不住对慈禧及其党羽这一伙卖国贼切齿痛恨。
    然而作者在七万多字的回忆中究竟记述了些什么呢？原来是不厌其烦地写宫庭中的吃饭、看戏、过节、拜寿、游园、宴会、画像、宫女和太监的装束，慈禧和女官的打扮，宫庭中的繁琐礼节……等等。看来当时的中国好像不是处在岌岌可危之中，而是一片升平气象；慈禧本人也不是那么腐朽昏溃，而不过是悠哉游哉的豪华贵妇；好像她不是一个封建统治阶级的毒辣而老练的首领，而是一个无可奈何的老实人。作者就是用一些宫庭生活细节的表面记述，把真正的政治问题掩盖下去，用一些五颜六色的生活脂粉，把这个罪恶渊薮的丑恶面目涂得模糊不清了。比如对震动世界的义和团的反帝爱国运动（作者称之为“庚子之乱”！）只是寥寥数百字带过，对这次运动的反帝斗争内容根本没有涉及，只是写了慈禧等一小群狼狈逃窜西安的生活情景，而对其沿途搜刮、受贿、勒索的罪行也一字不提。总之，读者从“清宫琐记”中，看不到慈禧及其党羽倒行逆施，媚外卖国的罪行。说“清宫琐记”是一本坏书，是不算过分的。
    我们有理由问“新观察”杂志，究竟为什么要用那么多的篇幅来连载这个“清宫琐记”？北京出版社，究竟为什么要大量出版这样一本书？也许北京出版社在出书的时候，也感到出版此书不是没有问题，所以才在书后又附了一篇“赘言”来弥补一下原书的缺陷吧！但那效果，恐怕是很小的。
