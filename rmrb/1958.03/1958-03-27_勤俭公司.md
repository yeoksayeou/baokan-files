    "Diligent and Frugal Company"
    Fu Dong
    Do you want to interview our Nantong Construction Engineering Company? Our company's office is on the main street of Nantong City. The building isn't large, but it's kept clean. People might think we spent a lot of money to buy it! Few people know what a dilapidated state the building was in originally. It used to be two small hotels and two small cigarette shops. The houses were unbelievably broken down. The stairs were so broken that they were unsafe to walk on, and the walls were so black that they looked like they had been painted. When the company was first established, many people clamored to build houses and buy furniture. We calculated that building a building would cost at least ten thousand, how could we do that? But not having a place to work was also not an option. We rented the small building, and everyone repaired it themselves. After some effort, we actually renovated it into a new building. The company only spent nine hundred yuan.

    If you go to our manager's office, you're sure to find it empty. The room is empty all day, and the manager is out running around all the time. Looking at this office, you'll definitely be surprised: how can the room be so small, so small that you can barely turn around? And how come the desks, chairs, and benches are all old?

    You may not be able to find anyone in the Party committee office either. All eight of our Party committee members are at the construction site, with only one staff member at home minding the door.

    There are also few people in the various department offices. The department heads spend a third of the year down at the worksites.

    You can go to our warehouse to take a look. The warehouse isn't big, only about eight rooms in size, with a thatched roof and reed walls. There aren't many things inside, just some neatly arranged paint, small hardware, lead sheets, ironware... Many people who come to visit ask, "How many warehouses does the company have?" When they learn that there's only one warehouse in total, they ask in surprise: "The company has hundreds of construction sites, but the warehouse has so few things, doesn't that cause delays?" They don't know that our construction sites finish the job with all materials used up. The materials are calculated quite accurately, so there's no need to stop work waiting for materials. Everyone even thinks our warehouse has too many things!

    Walking around the construction site, you might see many people riding bicycles in a hurry, with a large pile of luggage tied behind the bikes. In the river beside the road, there are large bamboo rafts floating, piled high with bedding, tools... Someone is pulling them from the shore. These bamboo rafts are as large as two or three train cars, and the smaller ones are also as long as one train car. This is how we move.

    On the road, you might run into our section chief, Zhang Qiaoji. His nickname is Zhang Midnight. His construction site is a hundred li or so from the company. If the company needs him, he gets up and gets on his bike, no matter what time it is. After finishing his business at the company, he rides back, no matter if it's the middle of the night. Therefore, everyone gave him this nickname. If you ask him why he does this, he'll definitely say, "We're poor people, we've always been like this."

    On the road, you might also encounter a cripple hobbling along. He's the section chief of the 106th construction section. People tell him not to run, but he insists on running and never wants to take a car.

    Many people who go out of town are reluctant to spend money on hotels. At night, they stay in temples if they find a temple, and they crawl into cave dwellings if they find a cave dwelling. Some people who have stayed in such places don't even utter a word of complaint when they come back.

    There are very few work sheds on the construction site. A construction site generally only has one shed made of reeds. This shed is smaller than those in other places, and the walls aren't plastered with lime. Inside, there are only bunk beds. Some beds are made of wood, and some are made of bamboo. These bamboo beds are too hard, and many people can't sleep on them. Our section chief sleeps on the bamboo bed himself and lets the workers sleep on the wooden beds.

    When you get to the construction site, you'll definitely ask this question: why are there so many workers, but so few beds? If you look carefully, you'll find that some people stay in the homes of nearby villagers at night, and some people go to rest in the corridors of nearby schools.

    Walking around the construction site for half a day, it's hard to find a desk. You might see someone sitting on the ground writing, with a small cement bag (containing books) on their knees. They call this a mobile desk.

    The construction site is very tidy. Bricks, wood, and stones are all arranged in their respective places. There are few broken bricks or broken pieces of wood on the ground. If you go to a construction site that's almost finished, you'll see the section chief leading the workers, busy checking materials. They even count every brick used for the toilet and every brick used for the stove. What are they doing? Originally, our supply department never gives the construction site enough materials at the beginning of the project. Generally, they only give 70%. When the project is almost finished, they check the materials; after checking, they compare them with the original construction budget plan to see how much material has been saved; according to this ratio, they calculate how much material is needed to complete the remaining project. The materials delivered in this way are, of course, just enough. The construction site naturally finishes the job with all materials used up, without leaving a single piece of wood.

    The company has a total of one thousand five or six hundred workers, but no matter where you go, you won't find an idle person. The workers are busy all year round.

    When you interview the workers, you're sure to meet someone like this: his pockets are bulging, and he's pushing a bicycle as if he's just come from afar. People who don't know him might think he's a postman! Without an introduction, no one would think that he's the company's deputy manager and a member of the company's Party committee, Comrade Chen Bin. He's out running around all day long. Can you guess what he's doing outside? He's getting business for the company. Building houses is different in each season. Often, the first half of the year is slow, and the second half is busy. When there's no work, we can't just sit at home and eat the state's food, we have to go out and find a way to survive. Our deputy manager has many ideas! Every year at the beginning of the year, he goes to the various bureaus in the province to inquire, asking which units need to build houses. After he finds out, he asks some work area directors to investigate with the relevant departments and construction units in the counties and cities. In this way, by investigating from above and below, and contacting left and right, everyone goes to "pay a personal visit." Things are really not easy! When they get to the construction unit, they sometimes have to sit on the cold bench. When they meet, they often run into obstacles.

    Do you want to understand how Comrade Chen Bin gets business? Then you can interview some workers, they can talk about a lot of facts.

    Once, Comrade Chen Bin went to the Hai'an County People's Hospital. As soon as he entered, people said, "What are you here for? We won't be building houses for a while yet!" Comrade Chen Bin explained for a while, and the hospital people said, "Building houses is too early! We haven't even designed it yet." As soon as Comrade Chen Bin heard this, he hurriedly took out a drawing from his pocket and said, "We have a design drawing, please take a look and see if it's okay? If it's not okay, we'll draw another one right away." Later, the hospital people said that they planned to build it themselves. Chen Bin calculated the accounts with them. After calculating, it cost about the same to contract it to the company and find someone to build it themselves. But the hospital still thought it was expensive and asked to lower the price. Chen Bin thought for a while: "It's better to earn less than to have the workers idle." So he agreed. This left the hospital with no choice but to have them contract the project. After everything was settled, the hospital people said that the design drawing had to be approved by the special commissioner's office. Chen Bin revised the design drawing and accompanied them to the special commissioner's office. A five-yuan transaction was completed in this way. When Comrade Chen Bin talks to others about these things, he always says, "Our method of doing business is similar to that of private merchants. However, private merchants are for personal gain, while the company is for socialist construction."

    If you have time, you can also interview the construction units and listen to what they have to say. Some units want to renovate their houses, but they don't have anyone. They want to find a company, but they're afraid that the company will think the project is too small and they don't dare to look. When we find out, we go to the door ourselves. Really, what is not for socialist construction? We do everything, big, small, sweet, bitter. Take a look at this form from the company, it's very interesting. From the form, you can see that we have projects worth one million yuan, and we also have projects worth five hundred yuan. We even take on the job of repairing toilets.

    On the streets of Nantong, you might run into someone shouting on the street: "I'm a painter, who wants to paint furniture?" "I'm a bamboo worker, who wants to repair fences or bamboo utensils..." A large group of people surrounded them, scrambling to find them to do work. These are our company's workers. They can't stay idle for a day. If the company has no work, they go to the street to solicit work themselves.

    When you visit the construction site, you'll also discover a strange thing: how can our carpenters, besides their own profession, also build walls and paint? And how can the bricklayers also install doors and windows, cut glass, and work as painters? We're afraid of delays, so we open a training class every winter to learn skills. Many people now know several skills. If this job can't be done, they do that job.

    If you go to the construction site to talk to our cadres, they definitely won't have time. Look at how busy they are! There's only one cadre at a construction site. He's accounting, checking materials, and going to the kitchen to look at the meals. They are proficient in everything. They manage planning, finance, materials, labor wages, general affairs, and meals. Otherwise, why would people call them "omnipotent cadres"! Many work area directors are also familiar with everything, one person顶几个人。

    When you get to the company, be sure to talk to our deputy manager, Comrade Lu Xiugen. He is our Party committee member. He's always at the construction site. When you go, you might find him telling the workers the story of the 25,000-li Long March, telling how the soldiers ate belts and wild vegetables and insisted on marching to fight the enemy. Maybe you'll find him talking about fighting the Japanese devils during the Anti-Japanese War... He's doing political work for the workers! He doesn't talk much, but when the workers hear it, their energy rises. The workers said, "Manager Lu doesn't need to speak, his actions are an education to us." The workers will also tell you many stories about Manager Lu. For example, once, he and a large group of people returned from a business trip with a large pile of luggage. Someone was about to hire a car, but seeing him pick up the carrying pole and carry the luggage, everyone dismissed the idea of hiring a car and all walked back. When he goes to Shanghai on business, he never stays in a hotel. When he goes out, he always takes a fifth-class cabin on the ship.

    Our seven Party committee members and more than a dozen section chiefs are all from poor backgrounds, and they are all reluctant to spend a penny. When the leaders do this, the workers follow suit.

    Our company mainly uses the practical actions of the leadership to do political work.

    I've talked about it in a rambling way here. For details, go to the construction site and take a closer look! (Attached image)

    “勤俭公司”
    傅冬
    你们想去我们南通建筑工程公司采访吗？我们公司的办公室在南通市大街上，楼不大，收拾得还干净。人们会以为我们花了多少钱买的呢！很少有人知道那楼原来的破烂样子。那原是两个小旅馆和两个小纸烟店。房子破得不像话了，楼梯坏的不能走人，墙上黑的像涂了层漆。公司刚成立时，好些人嚷嚷着要盖房子，置家具。我们合计了一下，盖个楼起码要上万，那怎么行？可是没有地方办公也不行。我们把小楼租下来，大伙自己动手修，三弄两弄，居然修成一幢新的。公司才花了九百块钱。
    你们要是到我们经理办公室去，一定会扑个空。那房里成天没人，经理一天到晚在外面跑。看了这个办公室，你们一定会奇怪：房子怎么这么小，小得几乎不能转身？屋里的桌、椅、板凳怎么全是旧的？
    到党委办公室也不一定能找到人。我们的八位党委委员全在工地，只一个干事在家看门。
    各科办公室也没有几个人，科长们一年有三分之一的时间在下面。
    你们可以到我们的仓库去看一看。仓库不大，只八间房那么大小，草顶子，芦苇墙，里面东西不多，只整整齐齐摆着些油漆、小五金、铅皮、铁器……。好些人来参观都问：“公司有几个仓库？”当他们知道通共只有一个仓库的时候，都奇怪地问：公司有几百个工地，仓库东西这么少，那不是要窝工吗？他们那里知道，我们的工地是工完料尽，料算得相当准，根本不会停工待料。大伙还嫌我们的仓库东西多呢！
    你们走到工地上，可能会见好些人骑着自行车在匆匆忙忙赶路，车后面捆着一大堆行李。路旁的河里，漂着一个个大竹排，上面堆满了铺盖、工具……有人在岸上拖。这些竹排大的有两三节火车那么大，小的也有一节火车长。我们搬家都是这样搬的。
    路上，说不定会碰上我们的段长张乔记。他外号叫张半夜。他的工地离公司有百十里路。公司有事找他，他不管什么时辰，爬起来骑上车子就走。到公司办完了事，不管三更半夜，又骑车返回去。因此，大伙就送他这么个绰号。你们假如去问他为什么这样做？他一定说：“咱是穷人，咱本来就是这样子。”
    你们在路上可能还会碰见一个拐子，他穿着草鞋，一拐一拐地在赶路。他是一零六工段的段长。人家不叫他跑，他偏跑，从来不肯坐车子。
    好多人到外地去，舍不得花钱住旅馆。晚上，他们见庙住庙，见窑洞钻窑洞，有些人住了这种地方，回来连啃都不啃一声。
    工地上的工棚很少，一个工地一般都只有一个用芦苇搭的棚子。这工棚比别的地方的小，墙也没用石灰粉刷。屋里全是上下铺。有的铺是用木头作的，有的是用竹子搭的。这种竹床太硬，好多人睡不来。我们的段长自己睡在竹床上面，叫工人睡木床。
    到工地你们一定会提出这么一个疑问：为什么工人不少，床位却不多？假如你们看得仔细，你们就会发现，有些人晚上到不远的老百姓家里住，有的人跑到附近的学校走廊里去歇。
    你们在工地走半天，很难见到一张办公桌。你们也许会看见有人坐在地上写字，膝盖上放着个小水泥袋（里面放着书）。他们管这叫流动桌。
    工地上很清爽，砖头、木头、石子，理得各是各的地方。地上很少碎砖头，碎木头。要是到快完工的工地，你们会见段长带工人，忙着在查点材料。他们连厕所上的砖、砌灶的砖都一个个数到了。他们这是干什么？原来我们供应科给工地发料，开工的时候从来没有一下子给够过，一般只给70％。到工程搞得差不离，就查料；查完了，同原来的施工预算计划比一比，看省出多少材料；按这个比例，再计算计算没有完的工程还要补多少料。这样送来的料，当然不多不少，工地上自然工完料尽，一块木板也剩不下。
    公司一共有一千五、六百工人，可是不论走到哪儿，你们都找不到一个闲人。工人一年四季都在忙。
    到工人里访问，你们定会见着这样一个人：他口袋里塞得鼓鼓囊囊的，推着个自行车像刚从远地跑来。不知道的人还以为他是个邮递员呢！没人介绍，谁也想不到他是公司的副经理、公司的党委委员陈彬同志。他一天到晚在外面跑。你们猜他到外面去干啥？他是给公司拉生意。盖房子这事儿四季不一样，常常是上半年闲，下半年忙。没活儿的时候，不能干坐在家里吃国家的饭，得出去找活路。我们的这位副经理点子可多啦！每年一到年初，他就到省里各个局去打听，问问下面有那些单位要盖房子。弄清楚了，就叫一些工区主任到县里、市里的主管部门和建设单位去摸底。这样，上摸，下摸，左右联系好了，大伙就分头去亲自“登门拜访”。事情真不容易呀！到了建设单位，有时要坐冷板凳。见了面，又常碰钉子。
    你们想了解陈彬同志怎么拉买卖吗？那你们可以访问访问一些工人，他们能谈出一大堆事实来。
    有一次，陈彬同志去海安县人民医院。一进门，人家就说：“你来干什么？我们盖房还早哩！”陈彬同志解释了一番，医院的人说：“盖房早哩！我们还没设计。”陈彬同志一听，忙从口袋里掏出一张图说：“我们有一张设计图，请你看看行不行？要不行，我们马上另画。”后来，医院的人说打算自己盖。陈彬就同他们一起算账，算来算去，包给公司和自己找人盖花的钱差不多。但是医院还嫌贵，要求降低价钱。陈彬想了想：“少收入点，总比工人窝工好。”他就答应下来了。弄的医院没办法，只好叫他们承包了这项工程。一切谈妥了，医院的人说，设计图要专署批准。陈彬便改了改设计图，又陪他们到专署。一笔五万元的买卖就这样做成了。陈彬同志同别人谈起这些事来，总是这么说：“咱作买卖的法子，跟私商差不多。可是，私商为的是个人赚钱，公司却是为的社会主义建设。”
    你们有空，还可以访问访问建设单位，听听他们怎么说。有的单位想翻修翻修房子，没有人，想找公司，又怕公司嫌工程小，不敢找。我们知道了，就自己找上门去。真的，什么不是为社会主义建设？我们是大的、小的、甜的、苦的，都干。你们看看公司这张表，很有意思。从表上可以看出我们有一百万元的活，也有五百元的活，连修厕所的活我们都接。
    在南通的大街上，你们说不定会碰见有人在街上喊：“我是个油漆工，谁家油家具？”“我是竹工，谁家修篱笆、竹器……”一大群人围上来，抢着找他们去干活。这是我们公司的工人。他们一天也闲不住，公司没活干，就上大街自己去揽活。
    你们去工地参观，还会发现一件怪事：怎么我们的木工，除了本行，还会砌墙、粉刷，有的还会捣混凝土？瓦工怎么还会装修门窗、划玻璃、作油漆工？我们怕窝工，每年冬天开个训练班学手艺。好些人现在都会几样手艺，这个活没得做，就做那个活。
    到工地上找我们的干部谈话，他们一定没时间。你看他们那个忙劲！一个工地只一个干部，他一会儿记账，一会儿点材料，一会又去厨房看伙食。他们是十八般武艺样样行，计划、财务、材料、劳动工资、总务、伙食样样都管，不然人家怎么会喊他们是“万能干部”！好些工区主任也是什么都熟，一个人顶几个人。
    你们到了公司，一定去找我们的副经理陆修根同志谈谈。他是我们的党委委员。他老在工地。你们去了，可能碰见他正在给工人讲二万五千里长征的故事，讲战士们如何如何吃皮带，吃野菜，坚持行军打敌人。也许会碰见他正在谈抗战时期打鬼子的事儿……他那是在给工人作政治工作哩！他话不多，可是工人们听了，劲儿就上来了。工人们说：“陆经理用不着说话，他的行动，对我们就是一种教育。”工人还会告诉你们许多陆经理的事迹。比如说，有一次，他和一大群人出差回来，带着一大堆行李。有人正准备雇车，见他拿起扁担挑着行李走，大家也就打消了雇车的念头，统统走回来。他去上海办事，从不住旅馆。他出门坐轮船，总是坐五等舱。
    我们七位党委委员和十几个段长全是穷人出身，都是一个钱舍不得花。领导这样，工人也就跟着学。
    我们公司主要就是这样用领导人员的实际行动作政治工作的。
    我拉拉杂杂就谈到这里，详细情况，你们到工地仔细看吧！（附图片）
