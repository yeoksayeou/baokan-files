Gannan Holds Comprehensive Experimental Farm
Local leaders believe this method is conducive to long-term
experimentation, systematic summarization of experience, and familiarity with comprehensive production knowledge

    This newspaper reports that the Gannan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province is running a comprehensive experimental farm to cultivate cadres who are both red and expert.
    The experimental farm plans to engage in various productions such as agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. This year, it plans to plant rice, cotton, sugarcane, peanuts, sesame, sweet potatoes, and various vegetables; raise chickens, rabbits, and pigs; and cultivate timber forests, economic forests, and fruit forests. All production activities are prepared to use various improved varieties and adopt various advanced experiences for experiments, to research, compare, and summarize the most advanced experiences and the best varieties for promotion.
    To combine cadres with the masses, the farm has decided to contract a portion of the land to farmers and conduct experiments together with them. The projects operated by the experimental farm are determined based on the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production in the entire district. For example, the district plans to greatly develop sugarcane production, so the farm will try planting sugarcane, combining farm experiments with comprehensive production. According to the person in charge of the Gannan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: running collective, multi-production experimental farms can sustain experiments for a long time, making it easy to systematically summarize experience, become familiar with comprehensive production situations, and increase various production knowledge. They said: engaging in scattered, small-scale experimental plots often makes it impossible to balance experiments, work, and comprehensive guidance, often sacrificing one for the other, to the point where experiments cannot be sustained and experiences cannot be systematically summarized. However, running comprehensive experimental farms solves the contradiction between experimentation, work, and comprehensive guidance, allowing all three to be taken into account and advance together.

    赣南举办综合试验农场
    当地负责人认为这种办法便于长期坚持
    试验，系统总结经验，熟悉全面生产知识
    本报讯　中共江西省赣南区党委为培养又红又专的干部，举办综合试验农场。
    试验农场计划进行农、牧、林等多种生产。今年计划种水稻、棉花、甘蔗、花生、芝麻、蕃薯和各种蔬菜；养鸡、养兔、养猪；营造用材林、经济林、果林等。所有各项生产都准备用各种优良品种、采取各种先进经验作试验，以便研究、比较，总结出最先进的经验和最优良的品种，加以推广。
    为使干部和群众结合，农场确定包耕农民部分土地，和农民一道作试验。试验农场所经营的项目是从全区农业生产大跃进需要出发而确定的。如该区计划大量发展甘蔗生产，农场就试种甘蔗，使农场试验和全面生产结合起来。据中共赣南区党委负责人谈：办集体的、多种生产的试验农场，能够长期坚持试验，便于系统总结经验，熟悉全面生产情况，增加各种生产知识。他们说：搞分散的、小型的试验田，往往试验、业务和全面指导工作不能兼顾，往往顾此失彼，以至试验不能持久，不能系统地总结经验。而办综合试验农场，就解决了试验、业务和全面指导工作的矛盾，使三者兼顾，齐头并进。（李连斌）
