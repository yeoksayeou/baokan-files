Production of Several Major Woody Oil Materials

	Oil Tea: Before liberation, China had about 33.53 million mu of oil tea forests, with a maximum annual output of 150,000 tons. On the eve of liberation, about 22 million mu of oil tea forests across the country were barren or semi-barren, with an annual oil output of only 40,000 tons, averaging 2.3 jin per mu.
	After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, large-scale nurturing and reclamation work was carried out in various places. By 1956, more than 5 million mu had been reclaimed nationwide, and output also increased year by year. Last year's tea oil output was 80,000 tons, and it is expected to reach 90,000 tons this year, more than double that of the early post-liberation period. Based on the actual production area of 16 million mu, the average yield per mu is 11.09 jin.
	Walnut: According to incomplete statistics, the national annual output of walnuts before liberation was about 46,900 tons. There are currently about 20 million fruit-bearing walnut trees in the country, with a recent annual output of about 100,000 tons, averaging about 10 jin per tree.
	Tung Oil Tree: The country currently has about 8.7 million mu of mature forests, with a maximum annual oil output of 150,000 tons before the Anti-Japanese War. In the early post-liberation period (1949), it dropped to 96,000 tons. Thanks to the Party and government's active leadership and rewards for planting tung trees, tung oil production reached 159,500 tons by 1956, exceeding the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War.
	Chinese Tallow Tree: China currently has about 2.31 million mu of mature Chinese tallow forests, with an annual oil output of about 30,000 tons in the early post-liberation period. In the past few years, through nurturing and management, the output has increased to 45,000 tons.

    几种主要木本油料生产情况
    油茶：解放前我国油茶林约有三千三百五十三万亩，最高年产量十五万吨。解放前夕，全国大约有二千二百万亩油茶林处于荒芜或半荒芜状态，年产油量仅四万吨，每亩平均产油二点三斤。
    解放后，在党和政府的正确领导下，各地开展了大规模的扶育垦复工作。至1956年，全国已垦复五百余万亩，产量也在逐年提高。去年茶油产量为八万吨，预计今年可达九万吨，比解放初期提高一倍以上。按实际生产面积一千六百万亩计算，平均每亩产十一点零九斤。
    核桃：据不完全材料统计，解放前全国年产核桃约四万六千九百吨。全国现有结实的核桃约二千万株，近几年的产量约为十万吨，每株平均十斤左右。
    油桐：全国现有成林约八百七十多万亩，抗日战争前最高年产油量十五万吨。解放初期（1949年）下降到九万六千吨，由于党政积极领导，奖励植桐，桐油生产至1956年已达十五万九千五百吨，超过抗日战争前最高年产量。
    乌?：我国现有乌?成林约二百三十一万亩，解放初期年产油量约三万吨左右。几年来，经过扶育管理，产量增加到四万五千吨。
