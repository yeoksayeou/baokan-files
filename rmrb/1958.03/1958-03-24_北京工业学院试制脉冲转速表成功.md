    Beijing Institute of Technology Successfully Trials Pulse Tachometer
    The domestically-made pulse tachometer has been successfully trial-produced by teachers and technicians of the Third Mechanical Engineering Department of the Beijing Institute of Technology. Tests have proven that its quality has reached international standards.
    The pulse tachometer is an essential instrument for measuring the operating speed of machines in industrial production and mechanical equipment. In the past, China could not produce it and relied on imports, which could not meet the demand. The newly trial-produced pulse tachometer is half the price of Swiss-made ones, and its quality is even better. Swiss mechanical tachometers use mechanical principles, which are prone to wear, and the pointer is unstable and has a large error. The pulse tachometer uses electromagnetic principles, so the accuracy will not be affected by mechanical wear. It does not need to be held by hand during use and can be operated remotely. This instrument is also of great value in teaching and scientific research. (Attached picture)

    北京工业学院试制脉冲转速表成功
    我国自制的脉冲转速表，已经由北京工业学院第三机械系教师和技工试制成功。经测试证明，它的质量达到了国际水平。
    脉冲式转速表是工业生产和机械设备中必需用的一种测试机器运转速度的仪表。过去国内不能生产，依靠进口，供不应求。新试制成功的脉冲式转速表要比瑞士制造的便宜一半，质量还较优越。瑞士的机械转速表因采用机械原理，容易磨损，指针不稳定，误差较大。而脉冲式转速表采用了电磁原理，不会因机械磨损而影响准确度，使用时不必用手拿，可以远距离操纵。这种仪表在教学上和科学研究上也有很大价值。（附图片）
