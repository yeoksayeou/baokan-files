    The "Land of Fruits and Vegetables"
    More than 4,000 students at Southwest Normal College, in carrying out work-study programs, have recently used their spare time to plant more than 150 mu of vegetables. It is estimated that the annual harvest will be 1.5 million to 1.7 million jin, with each student being able to eat an average of one jin of vegetables grown by themselves every day. In addition, they have also used the vacant land along the roadside and at the corners of houses to plant a lot of pumpkins, striving to turn the school into a "land of fruits and vegetables" this summer.

    “瓜果之乡”
    西南师范学院四千多学生，在开展勤工俭学活动中，最近利用课余时间，种了一百五十多亩蔬菜，预计全年可收获一百五十万到一百七十万斤，平均每个学生每天能吃到自己种植的蔬菜一斤。此外，他们还利用路边屋角的空地种了不少南瓜，争取在今年夏天把学校变成一个“瓜果之乡”。
