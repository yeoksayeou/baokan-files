    Trial Extraction of Oil from Ya'erxia's Oil Deposits
    The Ya'erxia new oilfield in the Jiuquan Basin will undergo large-scale oil testing and trial extraction this year.
    Currently, workers from the Yumen Oil Mine Oilfield Construction Engineering Company are accelerating the installation of oil selection stations in this new oilfield in preparation for oil extraction. A testing and trial extraction work team has also entered the area to begin work. The earliest oil-producing well, Ya-1, has been found to have two oil-producing layers after testing. One oil layer in Ya-5, which began producing oil last year, has recently been transformed from intermittent self-flowing to continuous self-flowing by the oil testing workers through a series of technical measures, and the oil production is considerable. After the testing of this well is completed, it will be handed over to the trial extraction workers for oil extraction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    试采鸭儿峡的藏油
    酒泉盆地鸭儿峡新油藏，今年将大规模进行试油、试采工作。
    目前，玉门油矿油田建设工程公司的工人正在这个新油藏上加紧安装选油站，准备采油时应用。一支试油、试采工作队，也已进入这个地区开始工作。喷油最早的鸭一井，经过试油已有两个油层出油。去年开始喷油的鸭五井中的一个油层，最近经试油工人采取一系列技术措施后，已由过去的间歇自喷变为连续自喷，出油量相当可观。这口井试油结束以后，就将交给试采工人采油。　（据新华社讯）
