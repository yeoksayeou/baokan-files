    Sent-Down Cadres Should Bring Cultural Knowledge to the Peasants

    Our country's rural areas are currently experiencing a vigorous great leap forward in production. This is a result of the fundamental completion of the revolution of the system of ownership and the victory of the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, under the leadership of the Party, by the 500 million peasants, which has led to a great liberation of the rural productive forces. The great liberation of the rural productive forces also urgently demands a great liberation of culture. The millions of cadres who have already been sent down and are about to be sent down across the country are an important force in supporting the great liberation of rural culture.

    If the peasants do not achieve cultural liberation, it will be difficult to completely liberate the rural productive forces. Generally speaking, the complete liberation of rural productive forces must go through two fundamental reforms: social reform and technological reform. The basic realization of cooperativization in our country's rural areas marks the completion of the first fundamental reform. This reform has greatly liberated the rural productive forces, allowing the endless revolutionary determination and socialist enthusiasm of the 500 million peasants to develop unprecedentedly, forming the magnificent new agricultural production upsurge we see today. Now, in order to further promote the faster development of rural productive forces, and to combine the soaring courage of the broad masses of peasants in the great leap forward in production with culture and technology, and to rapidly change the face of the motherland's countryside, we must also carry out another fundamental reform, namely, the revolution in agricultural technology. Chairman Mao said in "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "Only when China has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in the social and economic system, and also in the technical aspect, in all departments and places where machines can be used, will machines be used, can the entire face of the social economy be changed." Chairman Mao's words point out to us that rural productive forces can only achieve complete development after undergoing social reform and technological reform. The Draft Revised Program for Agricultural Development proposed by the Party Central Committee is a fighting program for agricultural technological revolution and rural socialist construction. The movement to reform tools currently being carried out by hundreds of millions of peasants is the budding of the agricultural technological revolution. This is an inevitable trend for the continued development of agricultural production.

    However, an important prerequisite for implementing the agricultural technological revolution is to improve the culture of the peasants, because if the peasants lack culture, it will be difficult to quickly master various new technologies, which will cause many difficulties for the agricultural technological revolution. For example, in terms of basic agricultural construction, peasants feel difficulties in using levels, drilling machines, and various sluice gates; in terms of the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, they feel difficulties in formulating production plans, managing finances well, and implementing correct distribution; in terms of farmland cultivation, they feel difficulties in improving soil, combating pests and diseases, and using various new farm tools. Obviously, the fact that the majority of our country's peasants are illiterate is a major obstacle to implementing technological reform in rural areas and realizing the Draft Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have instructed us that eliminating the large number of illiterates left over from the old society is a task of strategic significance. Therefore, the agricultural technological revolution must be combined with the rural cultural revolution, and the peasants' learning of technology should be combined with improving culture.

    In order to promote the great leap forward in rural culture, sent-down cadres throughout the country, in addition to complying with the leadership of their units, abiding by rules and regulations, sharing weal and woe with the peasants, humbly learning from the peasants, and actively exercising and transforming themselves, should also actively participate in various political work and social activities in rural areas, teach their cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge to the peasants, and fully utilize their role in this regard.

    Can the sent-down comrades accomplish this task? The answer is yes. Because the vast majority of sent-down cadres are intellectuals. According to statistics from more than 2,000 cadres sent down from directly affiliated organizations in Henan Province, more than 70% of the cadres were students. Of the first batch of more than 4,000 cadres sent down from Shanghai, 82.3% had a junior high school education or above, and only 17.7% had a primary school education. Therefore, they are fully capable of undertaking the task of teaching cultural and scientific knowledge to the peasants. Judging from reports from various places, many sent-down comrades are doing just that. For example, of the 2,300 cadres sent down from Beijing to Fengtai District, more than 1,600 serve as literacy teachers for peasants. The more than 100 cadres sent down from the Second Ministry of Machine Building to Jiaohe County, Hebei, helped the peasants establish two spare-time middle schools, one spare-time accounting school, and eight spare-time primary schools. In addition, some also helped the peasants restore suspended private schools, helped the peasants read newspapers, explained current affairs policies to the peasants, introduced agricultural scientific knowledge, and engaged in patriotic health campaigns and cultural and recreational activities with the peasants. These comrades enthusiastically helped the peasants improve their culture, and the peasants praised them from the bottom of their hearts as "good cadres who are capable in both literary and military affairs." Some people have even been evaluated by the peasants as models. The spirit of these comrades is worth promoting, and their exemplary actions are worth learning from.

    The current problem is that the leadership of Party organizations in various places has not kept up in a timely manner. This is because they do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of sent-down cadres in promoting the great leap forward in rural culture. Therefore, they lack specific plans and measures on how to use this force, and they also lack summaries and promotion of the experience of helping peasants in cultural learning. As a result, this cultural army of sent-down cadres cannot better play their role in spreading culture when working with the peasants. On the side of the sent-down cadres, some comrades narrowly view the task of being sent down as simply engaging in pure labor training, because the leadership has not clearly explained the task, and they do not consider social work (including cultural and educational work) outside of labor as their due responsibility. There are also some comrades who feel very tired after working all day long due to the lack of unified arrangements for production labor and social activities, so they no longer actively engage in cultural and educational work for the peasants. These problems are the most important obstacles to the current cultural and educational work of sent-down cadres towards the peasants. If these problems are not resolved quickly, it will be impossible for sent-down cadres to quickly participate in rural cultural work.

    Therefore, when leading and promoting the great leap forward in rural culture, Party organizations in various places must fully value and use the force of sent-down cadres, and organize them as soon as possible into the entire plan to "eliminate illiteracy and develop rural cultural and educational undertakings." Places that currently lack such a plan should quickly formulate such a plan. The leadership of sent-down cadres who have already participated in rural cultural work should be strengthened; those who have not yet participated in this work should be quickly mobilized to participate. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this work, Party organizations in various places must strengthen political and ideological work in this regard, explain the tasks and the advantages and disadvantages of each other to the sent-down cadres and peasants, and encourage them to respect and learn from each other. Sent-down cadres should be helped to correctly understand the dual tasks of being sent down for training, that is, on the one hand, they must wholeheartedly learn from the peasants in labor production and transform themselves (this is the main aspect); on the other hand, they must wholeheartedly help the peasants learn culture. In fact, in the process of labor production, intellectuals with certain cultural and scientific knowledge and peasants with rich production knowledge and practical struggle knowledge will inevitably help each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and improve together. This point was most clearly stated by the peasants of Hejian County, Hebei Province, when welcoming the sent-down cadres. Their slogan is: "Welcome teachers, receive apprentices, and jointly build a new countryside." What a vivid and powerful slogan!

    Now, every sent-down cadre should realize that only by doing a good job as both a teacher and an apprentice in labor production can we truly integrate with the working peasants and become one with them; only then can the task of being sent down for training be completed in a more comprehensive manner. It is wrong to think that helping peasants with cultural learning is not one's due responsibility. Similarly, the reason for not actively trying to carry out cultural work because of labor fatigue is also insufficient. As for grassroots cadres and the broad masses of peasants, we must also educate them to actively help sent-down cadres learn agricultural production knowledge and practical struggle knowledge; at the same time, we must also make them recognize the strengths of sent-down cadres and encourage them to work hard to learn cultural and scientific knowledge from sent-down cadres. Sent-down cadres in various places should work with the peasants to promote revolutionary vigor, summarize the successful experiences in the current cultural and educational work in rural areas, study and create new working methods that are in line with the actual conditions of rural areas and welcomed by the masses, such as contracting teaching and learning, delivering literacy to the door, compiling literacy textbooks for peasants, creating production poems, and so on.

    We can fully expect that, thanks to the support of all parties in the country, and through the joint efforts of the broad masses of intellectuals in the countryside and sent-down cadres, rural cultural work will surely see a great leap forward under the leadership of the local Party committees, and the tasks of rural cultural construction stipulated in the Program for Agricultural Development will surely be completed ahead of schedule.

### 下放干部要把文化知识带给农民

    下放干部要把文化知识带给农民
    我国农村，目前已经掀起一个热火朝天的生产大跃进运动。这是五亿农民在党的领导下，基本上完成了所有制的革命和取得政治上思想上的社会主义革命胜利以后，出现的农村生产力的大解放。农村生产力的大解放，也迫切地要求文化大解放。全国已经下放和即将下放的数百万干部，就是支援农村文化大解放的一支重要力量。
    农民在文化上如果得不到解放，农村生产力就难于得到彻底的解放。一般说来，农村生产力的彻底解放，必须经过两个根本的改革。就是社会改革和技术改革。我国农村基本实现合作化，就是完成了第一个根本改革。这个改革已经大大地解放了农村的生产力，使五亿农民蕴藏着的无穷无尽的革命毅力和社会主义积极性空前地发展起来，形成了目前规模宏伟的新的农业生产高潮。现在，为了进一步促进农村生产力更快地向前发展，使广大农民在生产大跃进中的那种冲天勇气和文化技术结合起来，迅速改变祖国农村的面貌，我们还必须进行另一个根本改革，即农业技术的革命。毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”中说过：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面澈底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观”。毛主席的话，给我们指出，农村生产力只有在经过了社会改革和技术改革以后，才能获得彻底的发展。党中央提出的农业发展纲要修正草案，就是农业进行技术革命和农村社会主义建设的战斗纲领。目前亿万农民正在进行的改革工具的运动，是农业技术革命的萌芽。这是农业生产继续向前发展的必然趋势。
    但是，实行农业技术革命的一个重要前提条件，就是要提高农民的文化，因为农民缺少文化，就难于很快掌握各种新技术，就会使农业技术革命碰到许多困难。比如，在农业基本建设方面，农民们就感到使用水平仪、钻探机和各种水闸等等的困难；在农业社的经营管理方面，就感到制订生产计划、搞好财务管理和实行正确分配的困难；在农田耕作方面，就感到改良土壤，战胜病虫害和使用各种新农具等的困难。显然，我国农民大多数处于不识字的状态，是农村实行技术改革和提前实现农业发展纲要草案的一大障碍。党中央和毛主席曾经指示我们说：扫除旧社会遗留下来的大量文盲，是具有战略意义的任务。所以，农业的技术革命必须同农村的文化革命结合起来，农民的学习技术就应当同提高文化结合起来。
    为了促进农村文化的大跃进，全国各地的下放干部，在劳动生产中，除了必须服从所在单位的领导，遵守制度和纪律，同农民同甘共苦，虚心向农民学习，积极锻炼和改造自己以外，同时，还应该积极参加农村的各项政治工作和社会活动，把自己的文化、科学技术知识教给农民，充分发挥自己在这方面的作用。
    下放同志能不能实现这个任务呢？回答是肯定的。因为下放干部绝大多数是知识分子干部。根据河南省直属机关下放的两千多名干部的统计，学生出身的干部占70％以上。上海市第一批下放的四千多名干部，初中以上文化程度的占82.3％，小学程度的只占17.7％。因此他们是完全能够担负起把文化科学知识教给农民的任务的。从各地的报道来看，不少下放同志也正是这样做的。比如北京市下放到丰台区的两千三百名干部，就有一千六百多人担任了农民的扫盲教师。第二机械工业部下放到河北交河县的一百多名干部，他们帮助农民建立了两所业余中学，一所业余会计学校和八所业余小学。此外，有的还帮助农民把停办的民校恢复起来，帮助农民读报，向农民讲解时事政策，介绍农业科学知识，同农民一起搞爱国卫生运动和文化娱乐活动等等。这些同志都热情地帮助农民提高文化，农民也就从心底称赞他们是“能文能武的好干部”。有些人还被农民评比成为模范。这些同志的精神是值得发扬的，他们的模范行动是值得学习的。
    当前存在的问题是，各地党组织的领导还没有及时地跟上去。这是由于他们对下放干部在促进农村文化大跃进中的作用还认识不足。因此，对于如何使用这支力量，也就缺乏具体的规划和措施，对于已经帮助农民进行文化学习的经验，也缺少总结和推广。这样，就使下放干部这支文化大军，在同农民一起劳动的时候，还不能更好地发挥他们传播文化的作用。在下放干部方面，也由于领导上任务交代得不够清楚，他们当中就有一些同志，把下放的任务很狭隘地看成只是进行单纯的劳动锻炼，对劳动以外的社会工作（包括文化教育工作），就不认为是自己应尽的责任。也有一些同志，因为生产劳动和社会活动的时间缺乏统一安排，一天劳动到晚，感到很疲累，也就没有再积极地去向农民进行文化教育工作。这些问题就是当前下放干部向农民进行文化教育工作最主要的障碍。如果这些问题不很快解决，下放干部就不可能迅速地参加农村的文化工作。
    因此，各地党组织在领导和促进农村文化大跃进的时候，必须充分重视和使用下放干部这支力量，把他们尽快组织到实现“扫除文盲，发展农村文化教育事业”的整个规划中去。目前缺少这种规划的地方，应当赶快制定这种规划。已经参加农村文化工作的下放干部，应当加强对他们的领导；还没有参加这项工作的，应当很快动员他们参加。为了保证这项工作顺利地开展，各地党组织必须加强这方面的政治思想工作，向下放干部和农民讲清任务和彼此的优缺点，鼓励他们互相尊重和互相学习。对下放干部要着重帮助他们正确认识下放锻炼的双重任务，这就是，一方面要在劳动生产中全心全意地向农民学习，改造自己（这是主要的）；另一方面又必须全心全意地帮助农民学习文化。事实上，在劳动生产过程中，具有一定文化科学知识的知识分子，同具有丰富生产知识和实际斗争知识的农民，必然要互相帮助、互相学习、取长补短、共同提高。这一点，河北省河间县的农民在欢迎下放干部的时候提得最为明确。他们的口号是：“迎先生，接徒弟，共同建设新农村”。这是多么生动有力的口号啊！
    现在下放的干部，每个人都应该认识，只有在劳动生产中很好地做了先生又做了徒弟这两方面工作的时候，才能真正做到和劳动农民相结合，和他们打成一片；下放锻炼的任务也才有可能比较全面地完成。那种把帮助农民进行文化学习看成不是自己应尽责任的想法是不对的。同样，因为劳动疲累就不积极设法去进行文化工作的理由也是不充足的。至于对基层干部和广大农民，我们也要教育他们积极地帮助下放干部，学习农业生产知识和实际斗争知识；同时，也要使他们认识下放干部的长处，鼓励他们努力向下放干部学习文化科学知识。各地下放干部应当和农民一道，发扬革命干劲，总结农村现行文化教育工作中的成功经验，研究和创造切合农村实际情况的、为群众所欢迎的新的工作方法，比如，包教包学，送字上门，编写农民识字课本，创作生产诗歌，等等。
    我们完全可以预期，由于全国各方面的支援，经过广大在乡知识分子和下放干部的共同努力，农村文化工作在当地党委的领导下，一定可以出现一个大跃进，农业发展纲要所规定的农村文化建设的任务，一定可以提前完成。
