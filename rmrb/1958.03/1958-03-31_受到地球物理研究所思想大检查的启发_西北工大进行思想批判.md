    Inspired by the Ideological Examination of the Institute of Geophysics
    Northwestern Polytechnical University Conducts Ideological Criticism
    (This newspaper report) According to the Shaanxi Daily news: Teachers of the fourth department of Northwestern Polytechnical University recently examined their conservative thinking and the “five airs” in teaching.

    Before the examination, the teachers studied the People's Daily report on March 11 about the ideological leap forward of scientists at the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and their thinking was greatly inspired. They put forward the slogan "Break through conservatism, burn the five airs, and become thoroughly proficient and specialized!" Each teaching and research group held several meetings in succession, and old professors and young teachers held separate heart-to-heart talks. Subsequently, the entire department held a great ideological leap forward meeting. At these meetings, the teachers, on the one hand, examined themselves, and on the other hand, helped each other, deeply examining and criticizing conservative thinking and the five airs in teaching and scientific research. For example, some teachers examined that in the past, they held a middle-of-the-road attitude of neither being active nor falling behind in politics and work. Therefore, they lacked political enthusiasm and the initiative to carry out scientific research, and they didn't even revise a lecture manuscript for several years. Some examined themselves for working like practicing Tai Chi, pushing away whatever could be pushed away. In the examination and criticism, everyone was greatly shaken. Many teachers reflected: In the past, they always felt uncomfortable when they heard criticism, but this time, hearing criticism not only made them feel happy and comfortable but also increased their enthusiasm.

    受到地球物理研究所思想大检查的启发
    西北工大进行思想批判
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：西北工业大学四系的教师们，最近检查了教学上的保守思想和五气。
    检查以前，教师们学习了人民日报3月11日关于中国科学院地球物理研究所科学家们思想跃进的报道，思想上受到很大启发。他们提出了“攻破保守，火烧五气，红透专深”的口号。各教研组连续开了几次会，老教授和青年教师分别开了谈心会。接着，全系又开了思想大跃进会。在这些会上，教师们一面自己检查，一面互相帮助，深入检查批判了教学和科学研究上的保守思想和五气。如有的教师检查出以前自己在政治上和工作上，抱着不积极也不落后的中间态度，因此，缺乏政治热情和开展科学研究的积极性，一本讲稿用上几年也不修改。有的检查自己做工作像打太极拳，能推的就往外推。在检查批判中，使大家受到很大震动。许多教师反映：过去听到批评，总不舒服，这次听到批评，不但心情愉快舒畅，而且增加了干劲。
