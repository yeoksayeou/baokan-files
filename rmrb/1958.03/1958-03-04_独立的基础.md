    "The Foundation of Independence"
    Mollet once described atomic energy as the "foundation of independence" for France. Because France lacks domestic energy resources and has to import large quantities of coal and oil from abroad every year, the early utilization of atomic energy would undoubtedly be of great benefit to the economy.
    Unfortunately, according to a recent announcement by Francis Perrin, High Commissioner of the French Atomic Energy Commission, the start of France's five-year atomic energy development plan will be delayed by a full year. The reason is that the 1958 atomic energy budget has been cut by 4 billion francs; while the cost of two plutonium-producing reactor projects has increased by 4 billion francs due to delayed investment and rising prices.
    In total, the shortfall is only 8 billion francs, which is equivalent to only four days' worth of expenses for the Algerian war. The French government spends 700 billion francs a year on colonial wars without any reluctance, but for this mere 8 billion francs, it does not hesitate to delay the atomic energy development plan by a year. It turns out that the "foundation of independence" is so worthless in France.

### “独立的基础”

    “独立的基础”
    摩勒曾经把原子能说成是法国“独立的基础”。因为，法国国内缺乏动力资源，每年要从外国进口大量的煤和石油；如果能够把原子能及早利用起来，对经济无疑有很大好处。
    不幸的是，据法国原子能高级委员弗朗西·贝朗最近宣布，法国发展原子能五年计划的开始将要推迟整整一年。原因是：1958年的原子能预算被削减了四十亿法郎；而两个生产钚的反应堆工程，由于投资拖延、物价上涨，费用却增加了四十亿法郎。
    总起来说，所缺的款项不过是八十亿法郎，才等于阿尔及利亚战争四天的费用。法国政府在殖民战争中每年一掷七千亿法郎而毫无吝色，但是为了这区区八十亿法郎却不惜让原子能发展计划延迟一年。原来，“独立的基础”在法国是这样的不值钱。
