People's Daily Wuhan, March 6th. A nationwide campaign against waste and conservatism is vigorously unfolding in Wuhan. Over 1,000 units and 350,000 people throughout the city have joined this movement. Workers at Factory 201 proposed to carry out the movement "with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, the determination of Tang Sanzang in retrieving the scriptures, the courage of Wu Song in fighting the tiger, and the momentum of the Monkey King's havoc in the Heavenly Palace." Within three days, they put up more than 2,000 big-character posters, exposed more than 3,000 problems, and held 16 exhibitions. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's workers' representative meeting also put forward the action slogan "One Great Leap Forward, Full of Drive, Sparking from a Hundred Points (referring to one hundred division-level cadres), A Thousand Leading the Way (referring to one thousand section-level cadres), Universal Ventilation (referring to Party and League members), and All-Out Mobilization," calling on all workers to immediately rise up and launch a campaign against waste and conservatism. Representatives also exposed many problems of waste and conservatism on the spot. Various engineering companies also wrote more than 4,000 big-character posters and sent them to the meeting.

During this movement, many units in the city learned from the experience of Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 and implemented the "three togethers" with the masses. The four full-time cadres of the Hongxing Cloth Factory in the Qiaokou District are now fixed to machines, participating in labor every day, and studying problems with the masses. Originally, there was this argument in the Wuhan Yarn Factory: "Flying floss has no fiber and cannot be spun into thread," so a lot of flying floss was discarded. This time, they worked with the masses to find ways to spin the flying floss into thread, breaking conservative thinking and opening up a path for the city to utilize flying floss. The yarn quality of Zhenhuan Yarn Factory has always been poor; last October, no inspection reached the national standard rate. This year, they put forward the slogan "Fighting hard for a year to catch up with State-owned Cotton Mill" and adopted the method of "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals," organizing hundreds of cadres and workers to learn from the experience of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, and implemented a "one-stop" experimental field. As a result, the quality of 32-count yarn has improved by leaps and bounds, surpassing the advanced level of the city; the quality of cotton cloth is approaching the level of the most advanced Shanghai and Qingdao.

    武汉大反浪费保守
    一个跃进
    十足干劲
    百处点火
    全面发动
    本报武汉6日电　全民性的反浪费反保守运动在武汉猛烈展开。全市已有一千多单位，三十五万人卷入这个运动。二○一厂职工提出“以愚公移山的精神、唐僧取经的决心、武松打虎的勇敢、孙悟空大闹天宫的声势”来开展运动，三天之内就贴出二千多张大字报，揭出三千多个问题和办了十六个展览会。武汉钢铁公司职工代表会议还提出“一个跃进，十足干劲，百处点火（指一百名处级干部），千军带头（指一千名科级干部），万能通风（指党团员），全面发动”的行动口号，号召全体职工立即起来开展反浪费反保守运动。代表们还当场揭发出许多浪费保守问题。各工程公司也写了四千多张大字报送到会上。
    在这次运动中，全市许多单位都学习武汉国棉一厂的经验，实行与群众“三同”。礄口区的鸿兴布厂的四名脱产干部，现在都固定机台，每天参加劳动，与群众研究问题。原来武汉市纱厂里有这种论调：“飞花没纤维，不能纺线”，很多飞花都抛弃了。他们这次就与群众一起想办法用飞花纺成线，打破了保守思想，为全市利用飞花开辟了道路。震寰纱厂的纱支质量一直不好，去年10月份没有一次检验达到国家标准品率。他们今年提出“苦战一年，追上国棉”的口号，采取兵对兵、将对将的办法，组织了数百名干部和工人去国棉一厂学习经验，并实行“一条龙”的试验田。三十二支纱的质量因此突飞猛进，超过全市先进水平；棉布质量接近全国最先进的上海、青岛的水平。
