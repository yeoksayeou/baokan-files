    △ Shandong Province will gradually realize rice cultivation as water conservancy is progressively achieved. The Shandong Province Rice Production Work Conference, recently convened, proposed a development plan for this year, focusing on experimentation, comprehensive expansion next year, and achieving 20 million to 40 million mu of paddy fields by 1962. In 1957, the rice acreage in Shandong Province was less than 130,000 mu. Once this long-term plan is realized, the total output of rice and wheat alone in the province can reach over 30 billion jin, exceeding the current total output of all grain crops in the province.
    △ Jiangsu Province has recently been widely promoting the "poor" method of raising pigs with green and coarse fodder, which has greatly promoted the leap forward in pig production. Currently, the total number of pigs in the province has reached 12 million, and efforts are being made to reach 15 million in 1958 and 40 million in 1962. After this plan is realized, the application of stable manure per mu of cultivated land can reach more than 15 dan in 1958 and more than 40 dan in 1962. The income of agricultural cooperatives will also be greatly increased, with the output value of pigs leaving the sty in 1958 increasing from 360 million yuan in 1957 to over 700 million yuan, and reaching over 1.8 billion yuan in 1962. This will also greatly benefit the market meat supply and national exports, supporting socialist industrialization.

    △山东省将随着水利化逐步实现水稻化。最近召开的山东省水稻生产工作会议提出了今年重点试验，明年全面展开，1962年水稻田达到二千万亩到四千万亩的发展规划。1957年山东全省水稻面积不足十三万亩。这一远景规划实现后，全省仅稻、麦两项作物的产量即可达到三百亿斤以上，超过目前全省粮食作物的总产量。
    △江苏省最近普遍推广了用青粗饲料养猪的“穷”办法，促使养猪生产大大跃进。目前，全省生猪圈存量已经达到一千二百万头，1958年生猪争取达到一千五百万头，1962年争取达到四千万头。实现这个规划之后，1958年每亩耕地积施厩肥就可以达到十五担以上，1962年达到四十担以上。农业社的收入也将大大增加，1958年的猪子出圈产值将由1957年的三亿六千万元提高到七亿以上，1962年达到十八亿以上。这样也将大大有利于市场肉食供应和国家出口，支援社会主义工业化。
