Editor's Notes:

    The workers of the Hangzhou area of the Shanghai Railway Administration, in the movement against waste and against conservatism, launched a "Six Comparisons" competition: compare actions, compare energy, compare offensives; compare writing speed, compare writing quantity, compare writing scope. Many units have set plans to write thousands or tens of thousands of big-character posters. In a few days, big-character posters were dazzling everywhere.

    Big-character posters are the main weapon for the masses to oppose waste and attack conservatism. The more big-character posters the masses put up, the wider the contact surface and the deeper the problems exposed. In this sense, quantity is quality, and the number of big-character posters is a sign of how well the movement is being carried out.

    At present, the "double anti" movement in some enterprises has already begun, but big-character posters are sparse. This shows that these units have not fully mobilized the masses. It is hoped that the leaders of these units will make more efforts to effectively mobilize the masses to launch a high tide of posting big-character posters. In this way, the "double anti" movement will achieve a great victory.

### 量多质就好

    量多质就好
    上海铁路管理局杭州地区的职工，在反浪费反保守运动中展开了“六比”竞赛：比行动，比劲头，比攻势；比写快，比写多，比写广。许多单位都定出规划，要写几千张、几万张大字报。不几天，大字报便到处琳琅满目。
    大字报是群众反浪费、攻保守的主要武器。群众贴的大字报多，接触的面就广，揭发的问题就深。从这个意义上讲，数量就是质量，大字报多少就是运动开展得好坏的标志。
    目前，部分企业双反运动已经开始，大字报却冷冷落落。这就说明这些单位还没有把群众充分发动起来。希望这些单位的领导人员再加一把劲，切实发动群众掀起个贴大字报的高潮。这样，双反运动才会大获全胜。
