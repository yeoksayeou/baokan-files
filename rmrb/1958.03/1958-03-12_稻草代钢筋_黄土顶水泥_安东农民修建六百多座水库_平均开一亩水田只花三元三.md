Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang News: The experience of Andong County, Liaoning Province, proves that strong and durable reservoirs can be built without steel and cement.

Of the 840 reservoirs of varying sizes built in Andong County from the winter of 1955 to the beginning of March this year, the dam walls were all built with yellow earth instead of reinforced concrete. More than 200 of these reservoirs used only a small amount of cement and nails for spillways, sluice gates, and water inlets. The remaining 600-plus reservoirs, which irrigate between 100 and 1,000 mu of farmland, used absolutely no steel or cement. They put forward the slogan "Save where you can, don't compete with the industrial sector for materials," and creatively solved the problem of substitute materials by pooling the wisdom of the masses.

The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative of Heiyu Pao Township built a reservoir last year to irrigate 300 mu of paddy fields. The spillway was originally intended to be poured with cement, but some cooperative members suggested, "Cement is a urgently needed material for national industrial construction, and it's both expensive and difficult to buy. Can't we find a way to save it?" The cooperative director listened and gathered the more than 100 cooperative members participating in the construction to study the issue. Based on the principle that mountain grass and trees can provide waterproof protection for slopes, they devised a method of using yellow clay and straw to build the spillway (the straw is laid slightly inclined upwards in the direction of the flow, with the lower half rammed into the yellow clay), so that floodwaters overflow across the straw. In addition, they devised a method of using wooden pipes instead of cement pipes for water inlets, and using thick round logs to make sluice gates. After more than a year of testing, there have been no problems. For other reservoirs, some used thick wooden planks or stone slabs instead of steel plates for sluice gates, some used thick curtains woven from straw or corn stalks instead of the stone slope protection that was previously plastered with cement, and some used round logs with drilled holes instead of cement pipes, etc.

The Hongchang Agricultural Cooperative of Zhushan Township saved materials by simplifying engineering structures. On the dam walls of their reservoir, they used large recumbent stones to pad yellow clay and build a narrow and deep notch. They used grass bags filled with yellow earth to block the notch. During overflow and irrigation, they removed one or more layers of grass bags according to different needs and water levels, allowing this single notch to function as a spillway, sluice gate, and water inlet, which not only saved steel and cement, but also saved timber.

According to investigations, the cost of these 600-plus reservoirs that did not use steel or cement is very low, averaging only 3.3 yuan per mu of paddy field developed. This is more than half the cost of using steel and cement, and hundreds of reservoirs were even built without spending a penny.

### 稻草代钢筋　黄土顶水泥  安东农民修建六百多座水库　平均开一亩水田只花三元三

    稻草代钢筋　黄土顶水泥
    安东农民修建六百多座水库　平均开一亩水田只花三元三
    新华社沈阳讯　辽宁省安东县的经验证明：不用钢材和水泥也可以建成坚固耐用的水库。
    安东县从1955年冬到今年3月初修建的八百四十座大小水库，坝墙全部是以黄土代替钢筋混凝土筑成的。其中有两百多座水库，只在溢洪道、闸门、水口上使用了少量水泥和钉子；还有六百多座灌田百亩以上千亩以下的水库，根本没有用钢材和水泥。他们提出“能省就省，不跟工业部门争料”的口号，集中群众智慧，创造性地解决了代用材料的问题。
    黑鱼泡乡前进农业社去年修的一座灌溉稻田三百亩的水库，溢洪道本来要用水泥浇灌，但有的社员建议：“水泥是国家工业建设急需的物资，又贵又不好买，咱们想法省了不行？”社主任听了，就把参加施工的一百多名社员集中起来研究，根据山上草木能起防水护坡作用的道理，研究出用黄粘土和稻草修溢洪道（稻草上稍顺着流向朝上斜卧，下半截夯在黄粘土里），使洪水从稻草上溢过去。另外还研究出用木筒代替水泥管做水口，用粗圆木制成闸门。经过一年多的考验，没有出过任何毛病。其它的一些水库，有的用厚木板或石板代替钢板做闸门，有的用稻草或玉米秸编成厚帘子代替过去用水泥抹缝的护坡石，有的用圆木凿孔代替水泥管等。
    珠山乡红昌农业社用简化工程构造的办法节省用料。他们在水库坝墙上，用大卧牛石垫黄粘土砌成一个又狭又深的缺口，用草袋装黄土闸上，在溢水和灌水时，根据不同的需要和水位揭去一层或几层草袋，使这一个缺口发挥了溢洪道、闸门、水口的三种功能，不但没用钢材和水泥，连木料也省下了。
    根据调查，这六百多座不用钢材和水泥的水库，成本很低，平均每开一亩水田只花三元三角钱，比用钢材、水泥降低成本一半多，甚至有上百座水库没花分文就修成了。
