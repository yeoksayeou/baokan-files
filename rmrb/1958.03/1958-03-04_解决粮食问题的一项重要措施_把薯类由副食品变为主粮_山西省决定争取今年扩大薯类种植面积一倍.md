Editor's Note: Potato crops are very useful. They can be eaten by people, pigs, and cattle, and can be used to make flour, sugar, and alcohol. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee recently issued a joint instruction calling on all localities to expand the planting area of potato crops, and decided to formally include potato crops as one of the main varieties of grain subject to unified purchase. This measure is very important. We believe that all localities should also promote the planting of potato crops according to local conditions. For example, Hebei should mainly plant sweet potatoes, and Shanxi should mainly plant potatoes (山药蛋); in particular, we must break the idea of emphasizing grain and neglecting potatoes, and make potato crops one of the staple foods for urban and rural people. The national grain authorities should purchase potato crops and potato products as a staple food, and do a good job in processing and supplying them.

(Xinhua News Agency) According to the Shanxi Daily: The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee issued a joint instruction on February 28, requiring all localities in the province to expand the planting area of potato crops this year, to increase it by at least 70% compared to 1957, and strive to increase it to double.

The instruction pointed out: Potato crops (including potatoes and sweet potatoes) are suitable for planting in most areas of Shanxi, and are high-yield crops. In the Yanbei and Xin County areas, as well as the mountainous areas of other special districts, potato crops are one of the main foods in rural areas. Potato crops are not only high in yield and have great economic value, but also have a wide range of uses: they can be used as food, as vegetables, to feed pigs and cattle, to grind flour, to make powder, and to make wine and sugar. Actively expanding the planting area of potato crops and increasing the production of potato crops is one of the important ways to solve the food problem and meet the food needs of urban and rural people. Storing some dried potato slices and potato flour can also prevent possible disasters. Therefore, the instruction requires Party committees and people's governments at all levels throughout the province to earnestly mobilize the masses, conduct debates, formulate plans to expand the planting area of potato crops and increase the yield per unit area of potato crops, and take effective measures to ensure that the production of potato crops in the province will have a new leap forward in 1958.

In order to dispel the concerns of many agricultural producers' cooperatives' cadres and members that planting too many potato crops would mean that the state would not purchase them, leaving farmers with too many potatoes and unable to adjust their lives, the instruction announced: The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee has decided that from 1958, potato crops will be formally listed as one of the main varieties of grain for unified purchase. When agricultural cooperatives (including individual farmers) deliver grain under the unified purchase system, the proportion of potato crops can reach 30%-40% in concentrated production areas, and 10%-20% in general production areas. When delivering potato crops, dried potato slices, potato starch, or a portion of fresh potatoes can be delivered. If agricultural cooperatives still have a surplus of potato crops or potato products after completing the state's unified grain purchase task, the grain departments should guarantee purchase if they voluntarily sell them.

The instruction called for the widespread promotion of eating potato crops and potato products among the people in cities and towns throughout the province and the non-agricultural population receiving state grain rationing. The state supply of potato crops can generally reach 20%-30% of the quantitative supply standards for various types of people. Agricultural cooperatives lacking grain and needing state grain supply should also be supplied with a certain proportion of potato crops or potato products, depending on local conditions. In order to more effectively utilize and exploit the economic value of potato crops, the instruction requires local industrial departments (mainly county-run industries), grain departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives to actively build small-scale enterprises such as starch processing plants and potato alcohol manufacturing plants near potato production areas, and to actively promote potato processing by agricultural cooperatives, help them solve the equipment for potato processing, and impart the technology of potato processing, so that agricultural cooperatives throughout the province can carry out potato drying, flour production and other processing operations.

The instruction requires agricultural departments and grain departments throughout the province to actively promote advanced experience in storing potato crops and assist agricultural cooperatives in doing a good job in the storage of potato crops. The grain departments should also strive to do a good job in the transportation of potato crops and increase the necessary equipment for storing potato crops, ensuring timely transportation and proper storage.

The instruction pointed out: At present, in order to expand the planting area of potato crops, it is urgent to solve the seed problem. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance on planting potato crops and actively prevent and control potato late blight. (Attached picture)

### 解决粮食问题的一项重要措施  把薯类由副食品变为主粮  山西省决定争取今年扩大薯类种植面积一倍

    解决粮食问题的一项重要措施
    把薯类由副食品变为主粮
    山西省决定争取今年扩大薯类种植面积一倍
    编者按　薯类大有用处，可以人吃、猪吃、牛吃，可以造粉、造糖、造酒。中共山西省委、山西省人民委员会最近发出联合指示，号召各地扩大薯类种植面积，并且决定把薯类正式列为粮食统购的主要品种之一。这个措施十分重要。我们认为，各地也应因地制宜推广薯类种植，例如河北主要种红薯，山西主要种山药蛋；特别要打破重粮轻薯思想，使薯类由副食品变为城乡人民的主粮之一。国家粮食机关要把薯类和薯类制品作为一种主粮进行征购，做好加工和供应工作。
    本报讯　山西日报消息：中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会，2月28日发出联合指示，要求全省各地今年扩大薯类种植面积，至少要比1957年增加70％，努力争取增加到一倍。
    指示中指出：薯类（包括山药蛋、红薯）在山西大部地区都适宜种植，而且是高产作物。在雁北和忻县地区以及其它专区的山区，薯类又为农村主要食品之一。薯类不仅产量高、经济价值大，而且用途很广：可以作食粮，可以作蔬菜，可以喂猪、喂牛，可以磨面、制粉，可以造酒、造糖。积极地扩大薯类种植面积，增加薯类生产，这是解决粮食问题、满足城乡人民粮食需要的重要出路之一。储备一部分薯干和薯粉还可以防备可能发生的灾荒。因此，指示要求全省各级党委和人民政府认真发动群众，经过辩论，制定出扩大薯类种植面积和提高薯类单位面积产量的计划，并且采取有效措施，保证1958年全省薯类生产有一个新的大跃进。
    为了解除许多农业生产合作社的干部和社员耽心薯类种植多了，怕国家不统购，给农民留薯类过多，不能调剂生活的顾虑，指示中宣布：山西省人民委员会决定从1958年起，将薯类正式列为粮食统购的主要品种之一。各地农业社（包括个体农民）在交售统购粮食的时候，薯类所占的比例，在集中产区可以达到30％—40％，在一般产区可以达到10％—20％。在交售薯类的时候，可以交薯干，可以交薯制淀粉，也可以交一部分鲜薯。农业社在完成国家粮食统购任务之后，薯类或薯类制品仍有剩余，如果自愿出售时，粮食部门应保证收购。
    指示号召在全省市、镇人民和受国家粮食定量供应的非农业人口中，广泛提倡食用薯类和薯类制品。国家供应薯类的标准一般可以达到各类人口定量供应标准的20％—30％。需要国家供应粮食的缺粮农业社，也应根据各地情况，供应一定比例的薯类或薯类制品。为了更有效地利用和发挥薯类的经济价值，指示要求地方工业部门（主要是县营工业）、粮食部门和供销合作社，在接近薯类产地积极地兴建淀粉加工厂和薯类酒精制造厂等小型企业，并且要积极提倡农业社进行薯类加工，帮助他们解决薯类加工的设备，传授薯类加工的技术，使全省农业社都能进行薯类制干、制粉等加工业务。
    指示要求全省农业部门和粮食部门积极地推广保管薯类的先进经验，协助农业社做好薯类的保管工作。粮食部门还应努力做好薯类的运输工作，增加必要的保管薯类的设备。保证调运及时，保管得当。
    指示指出：目前，为了扩大薯类的种植面积，迫切地需要解决种籽问题。同时，需要加强种植薯类的技术指导，积极地防治薯类晚疫病。（附图片）
