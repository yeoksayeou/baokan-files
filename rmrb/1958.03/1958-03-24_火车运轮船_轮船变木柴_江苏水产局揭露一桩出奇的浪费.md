In the high tide of the "Double-Anti" movement in Jiangsu Province's provincial-level organs, the Provincial Agriculture Department's Aquatic Bureau displayed a big-character poster titled "Boats Traveling on Land, Trains Transporting Ships, Resulting in a Pile of Wood." This big-character poster revealed: At the end of 1956, the Central Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Bureau had a batch of tugboats and decided to allocate them to various provinces. The Provincial Aquatic Products Supply and Marketing Company immediately submitted an application and was approved to transfer a No. 24 tugboat to Jiangsu Province. When the company sent someone to Tianjin to pick up the boat, they thought that the tugboat was an inland river vessel and could not travel by sea. They also felt that the ship's engine was very good, but the hull's wooden planks were a bit old, so they only wanted the engine and not the hull. The Central Aquatic Products Department disagreed, so they disassembled the engine and the hull and decided to transport them back separately by train. However, when loading the train, they found that the hull was too long and too wide and did not meet the railway transportation safety requirements. They then adopted the method of "cutting the feet to fit the shoes," cutting off one and a half feet from each side of the ship and five feet from the stern. After arriving at the Xiaguan Railway Station in Nanjing, because there was no large crane to unload such a heavy ship, they simply dismantled the broken hull on the train and sold it as firewood for two or three cents a pound. The engine was handed over to the joint state-private Nanjing Shipyard to reassemble a new hull. According to statistics, in addition to destroying and losing the original hull worth tens of thousands of yuan, they also wasted more than 6,000 yuan in travel expenses and train freight. A new hull cost more than 52,000 yuan to build.

After this incident was exposed, the leaders of the Agriculture Department required each division and bureau to conduct discussions in conjunction with it, identify the key problems of their respective departments, and mobilize the masses to deeply dig out the backward roots in their thinking and politics. After this, many big-character posters in the Seed Division exposed problems in seed work. After discussion and research by the masses, it was believed that this was a key issue, and the root cause was traced through the prominent incident of "small-grained red turning into large-grained red." In 1956, personnel sent by the Provincial Agriculture Department to Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, to transfer early-maturing corn seeds of "small-grained red" found that there was no such variety in the area and transported back 900,000 jin of late-maturing corn seeds of "large-grained red." Due to different natural conditions such as soil, climate, and rainfall, in addition to stockpiling 700,000 jin, the planted 40,000 mu of cornfields only grew stalks but did not bear tassels, resulting in a loss of approximately 4 million jin of corn. Through analysis and criticism, everyone realized that this was a serious manifestation of irresponsible bureaucracy. The leaders of the Provincial Agriculture Department attached great importance to the masses' criticism of their ideological style, expressed their willingness to be responsible for the explanation, and would concentrate their efforts to seize the key problems of the entire department and lead the masses in carrying out major rectification and reforms.

    火车运轮船　轮船变木柴
    江苏水产局揭露一桩出奇的浪费
    江苏省省级机关“双反”运动鸣放高潮中，省农业厅水产局出现了一张以“陆地行舟，火车运轮船，结果变成一堆木材”为题的大字报。这张大字报揭发：1956年底，中央水产部供销局有一批拖轮，决定分配给各省，省水产供销公司立即提出申请，经同意调拨一只二十四号拖轮给江苏省。该公司派人前往天津起运时，认为该拖轮是内河轮船，不能走海路，又觉得轮船机器很好，而船壳木板有些旧，就想只要机器，不要船身。中央水产部不同意，他们就将机器和船身拆开，决定分别用火车装运回来。但在装车时发现船身过长、过宽，不符合铁路运输的安全要求，他们竟采取“削足适履”的办法，把船的两舷各砍去一尺五寸，又将船尾砍去五尺。运到南京下关车站后，因没有起卸这样笨重轮船的大吊车，就索性把这只破船船身在火车上拆散，以二、三分钱一斤的价格当木柴卖掉，而将机器交给公私合营南京修船厂重新装配了一个新船壳。据统计，除毁坏和损失了原来价值数万元的船身外，还浪费掉车旅费、火车运费六千多元，新造的一个船壳就花掉五万二千多元。
    这一事件揭发出来以后，农业厅领导上要求每个处、局结合进行讨论，找出本部门的关键性问题，发动群众深入挖思想、政治上的落后根源。这以后，种子处的很多大字报，揭发了种子工作中的问题，经过群众讨论研究，认为这是关键性的问题，便通过“小粒红变成大粒红”的突出事件，追查产生的根源。1956年省农业厅派去山东胶县调运“小粒红”早熟玉米种的人，见该地没有这个品种，就运回九十万斤“大粒红”迟熟玉米种。由于土壤、气候、雨水等自然条件不同，结果除积压了七十万斤外，种植的四万亩玉米田，只长秸不结稖头，约损失了四百万斤玉米的收成。通过分析批判，大家都认识到这是一种严重不负责任的官僚主义表现。省农业厅领导人很重视群众对自己思想作风的批评，表示要负责交代，并要集中全力抓住全厅关键性的问题，领导群众大整大改。（附图片）
