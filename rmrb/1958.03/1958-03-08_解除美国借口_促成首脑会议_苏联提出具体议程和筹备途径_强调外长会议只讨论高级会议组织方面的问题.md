Xinhua News Agency, March 7th, Moscow dispatch by TASS: On February 28th, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, and handed him a memorandum from the Soviet government regarding the convening of a summit meeting with the participation of heads of government to discuss a series of pressing international issues. The full text of the memorandum is published below:

            Memorandum

    The Soviet government believes that convening a summit meeting with the participation of heads of government in the near future to discuss a series of pressing international issues is of utmost importance.

    It can now be stated with certainty that the proposal to convene this meeting (which has been the subject of exchanges of views between the governments of many countries in recent months) has received the support and endorsement of the governments of many countries and the broadest sections of the public.

    The people of all countries demand that effective measures be taken to prevent the threat of a war using atomic and hydrogen weapons, that there be a shift towards improving the entire international situation, and that conditions be created for peaceful cooperation between all countries. The people of all countries expect the upcoming summit meeting to solve this historic task.

    Recent exchanges of letters between the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the President of the United States indicate that both governments are in favor of holding talks between the highest state leaders.

    However, there are still many issues in the preparation for the summit meeting that must be consulted on immediately in order to accelerate the convening of the meeting.

    The Soviet government believes that, in order to achieve such consultation, all methods and avenues that help to reach an agreement as quickly as possible should be utilized.

    Certain issues related to the preparation of the meeting can be studied and resolved immediately through diplomatic channels. On the other hand, the governments of many countries, including the United States, believe that the preparatory work should not be limited to diplomatic channels, and that it is also appropriate to convene a meeting of foreign ministers at a certain stage.

    Taking this desire into account, the Soviet government expresses its agreement to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in order to accelerate the preparation of the summit talks between heads of government. The Soviet government suggests that the meeting of foreign ministers be held in April 1958.

    Since the purpose of the meeting of foreign ministers is to shorten the preparation period for the summit talks between heads of government as much as possible, the Soviet government believes that the scope of issues to be discussed by the foreign ministers should be strictly limited, that is, only to discuss organizational aspects related to the preparation of the summit talks.

    The Soviet government believes that the foreign ministers should be charged with formulating the agenda of the summit meeting, determining the participants in the meeting, and determining the date and location of the meeting.

    Regarding the participants in the meeting of foreign ministers, the Soviet government believes that this meeting should generally be attended by representatives of those countries that will participate in the summit meeting. The Soviet government has already put forward its views on the issue of membership in this meeting. Representatives of member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and member states of the Warsaw Pact, as well as representatives of some countries that do not participate in military blocs, such as India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Austria, can participate in the meeting.

    If, for some reason, it is considered appropriate to hold a smaller meeting of foreign ministers, then the Soviet government believes that the following countries can participate in the meeting: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, India, Yugoslavia, and Sweden. In this regard, any restrictions on the composition of the participants in the meeting of foreign ministers should by no means be equated with predetermining the issue of membership in the upcoming summit meeting.

    The Soviet government agrees that the meeting of foreign ministers should be held in a location that is acceptable to other participants in this meeting.

    The Soviet government's views on the agenda of the summit meeting with the participation of heads of government are already known to the US government. The Soviet government suggests discussing the following pressing international issues at this meeting:

    Immediately stop testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons;

    The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom abandon the use of nuclear weapons;

    Establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe;

    The member states of the North Atlantic Alliance and the member states of the Warsaw Treaty conclude a non-aggression pact;

    Reduce the foreign troops stationed in Germany and other European countries;

    Formulate an agreement on preventing sudden attacks;

    Measures to expand international trade relations;

    Stop war propaganda;

    Ways to ease tensions in the Middle East.

    In addition, the Soviet government has pointed out more than once that, as long as everyone agrees, it is also willing to discuss other specific suggestions that other countries participating in the meeting may put forward, aimed at ending the "Cold War."

    After carefully studying the views in the letter from US President Eisenhower to Soviet Minister of the Council of Ministers Bulganin, the Soviet government also expresses its willingness to discuss the following issues at the summit meeting:

    Prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes and remove foreign military bases on the territories of other countries. Reaching an agreement on this major issue would greatly reduce the danger of a sudden outbreak of war and would be a major step forward in creating conditions for the people of all countries to live in peace and tranquility;

    Conclude a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet government suggests inviting the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the discussion of this issue. Of course, the issue of the unification of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany into one country should not be the subject of discussion at the upcoming summit meeting, because this issue is entirely within the purview of the two Germanys;

    The issue of developing contacts and exchanges between countries. The Soviet government has always unswervingly advocated the greatest possible development of such contacts. It agrees with President Eisenhower's views expressed in his letter of February 15 this year on the importance of such contacts. The Soviet government also believes that such an event is of great significance: that leaders of countries maintain regular direct contact and exchange views on pressing international issues in order to strengthen mutual trust and consolidate universal peace.

    At the same time, the Soviet government has pointed out more than once that it believes that it is completely impossible to discuss issues related to the internal affairs of this or that country at the summit meeting or at any international conference. And the issue of the situation in Eastern European countries raised by the US government falls into this category. Discussing such issues would mean intolerable interference in the internal affairs of sovereign countries, which the Soviet Union would never do under any circumstances. The Soviet government simply cannot understand why it would be proposed to discuss the internal affairs of third-party countries, which are sovereign countries, and both the Soviet government and the US government maintain normal diplomatic relations with these countries. The Soviet government believes that raising such issues means deliberately sharpening relations between countries and deliberately threatening the agreement on the urgent issues of eliminating the "Cold War" and easing international tensions.

    The Soviet government believes that, in order to ensure the success of the summit meeting, the attention of the participants must be focused on issues whose resolution will indeed help to ease international tensions, strengthen trust between countries, and consolidate peace.

    The Soviet government hopes that the US government will give good consideration to the above reasons.

    解除美国借口　促成首脑会议
    苏联提出具体议程和筹备途径
    强调外长会议只讨论高级会议组织方面的问题
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社莫斯科7日电：2月28日，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯接见了美国驻苏联大使汤普逊，并且交给他一份苏联政府关于召开有政府首脑参加的最高级会议以讨论一系列迫切的国际问题的备忘录。备忘录全文发表如下：
            备忘录
    苏联政府认为在最近期间召开有政府首脑参加的最高级会议来讨论一系列迫切的国际问题具有极重大的意义。
    现在已经可以肯定地说：关于召开这个会议（近几个月来它一直是许多国家的政府交换意见的对象）的建议受到许多国家的政府和最广泛阶层的公众的支持和拥护。
    各国人民要求采取有效措施以防止爆发使用原子武器和氢武器的战争的威胁，要求在使整个国际局势健康化方面有一个转变，要求创造使一切国家进行和平合作的条件。各国人民期望即将到来的高级会议能够解决这项历史任务。
    苏联部长会议主席和美国总统最近交换的信件表明，两国政府都主张举行最高级的国家领导人的会谈。
    但是，在准备高级会议方面还有许多问题必须立即磋商，以便加速会议的召开。
    苏联政府认为，为了实现这种磋商，应当利用一切有助于尽速达成协议的方法和途径。
    有关筹备会议的某些问题可以通过外交途径立即加以研究和解决。另一方面，包括美国在内的许多国家政府认为，筹备工作不应当只限于外交途径，在一定阶段上召开外长会议也是适宜的。
    考虑到这种愿望，苏联政府表示同意举行外长会议，以便加速政府首脑高级会谈的筹备工作。苏联政府建议1958年4月举行外长会议。
    既然外长会议的目的是尽一切可能缩短政府首脑会谈准备工作的期限，因此苏联政府认为，外长们所要讨论的问题的范围应有严格限制，即只讨论有关筹备高级会谈的组织方面的问题。
    苏联政府认为，应当责成外长们制定高级会议的议程，确定参加会议的成员、举行会议的日期和地点。
    至于参加外长会议的成员，苏联政府认为，这个会议应当大致有那些将要参加最高级会议的国家的代表参加。苏联政府已经对这个会议的成员问题提出了意见。参加会议的可以有北大西洋联盟成员国和华沙条约缔约国的代表以及一些不参加军事集团的国家如印度、阿富汗、埃及、南斯拉夫、瑞典和奥地利等国的代表。
    如果由于某种原因，认为举行范围较小的外长会议是适宜的，那么苏联政府认为，参加会议的可以有下列国家：美国、英国、法国、意大利、苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、印度、南斯拉夫和瑞典。在这方面，外长会议参加者组成上可能有的限制，决不等于预先决定即将举行的高级会议的成员问题。
    苏联政府同意外长会议在可以为这个会议其他参加国所接受的地点召开。
    苏联政府对于有政府首脑参加的最高级会议议程的看法已经为美国政府所知悉。苏联政府建议在这次会议上讨论下列迫切的国际问题：
    立刻停止试验原子武器和氢武器；
    苏联、美国、英国放弃使用核武器；
    在中欧建立无原子武器区；
    北大西洋联盟参加国和华沙条约参加国之间缔结互不侵犯协定；
    缩减驻扎在德国和欧洲其他国家境内的外国军队；
    就有关防止突然进攻的问题拟订协定；
    扩大国际贸易关系的措施；
    停止战争宣传；
    缓和中近东地区紧张局势的途径。
    此外，苏联政府不止一次地指出，只要大家同意，它也愿意在会上讨论其他参加会议的国家可能提出的、旨在结束“冷战”的其他具体建议。
    仔细研究了美国总统艾森豪威尔给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的信中的看法后，苏联政府还表示愿意在高级会议上讨论下列问题：
    禁止把宇宙空间用于军事用途和撤除外国在别国领土上的军事基地。就这个重大问题达成协议，就会大大缩小突然爆发战争的危险，并且将是在创造条件使各国人民过和平安宁生活方面迈进的一大步；
    缔结对德和约。苏联政府建议邀请德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府来参加讨论这个问题。当然，关于德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国统一成为一个国家的问题不应当成为即将举行的最高级会议讨论的对象，因为这个问题完全是两个德国职权范围内的事；
    关于发展各国之间的联系和接触的问题。苏联政府始终不渝地主张尽量发展这种接触。它同意艾森豪威尔总统今年2月15日信件中就这种接触的重要性所表示的意见。苏联政府也认为这样一件事具有重大的意义：各国领导人经常保持直接接触、就迫切的国际问题交换意见以利于加强相互信任和巩固普遍和平。
    同时，苏联政府曾不只一次地指出，它认为在高级会议以及任何国际会议上去讨论有关这个或那个国家的内政问题是完全不可能的。而美国政府所提出的关于东欧国家的局势问题正属于这一范畴。讨论这类问题就意味着不可容忍地干涉主权国家的内政，这种事情苏联是无论如何也不会做的。苏联政府根本不能理解为什么会向它提出讨论第三者国家内政的建议，这些国家是主权国家，而且苏联政府和美国政府都同这些国家保持着正常的外交关系。苏联政府认为，提出这种问题就意味着故意使各国间的关系尖锐化，故意使就消灭“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势的迫切问题达成协议一事受到威胁。
    苏联政府认为，为了保证最高级会议的成功，必须使与会者的注意力集中在这样一些问题上，即它们的解决确实会有助于缓和国际紧张局势、加强各国间的信任和巩固和平。
    苏联政府希望美国政府很好地考虑上述理由。
