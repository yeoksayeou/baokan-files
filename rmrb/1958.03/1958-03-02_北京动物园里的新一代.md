    The New Generation in the Beijing Zoo
    Jiang Shaozhong
    After the Spring Festival, although Beijing still has occasional winds, the weather is obviously getting warmer. The number of visitors to the zoo is increasing day by day. Those animals that were afraid of the cold and hid in the animal houses for the winter are gradually leaving their warm rooms and entering the animal paddocks.

    These wild animals, which have been confined indoors for a whole winter, appear particularly active in the sunshine. At this time, visitors can still see young animals that are following their mothers to nurse or are already able to live independently from their mothers in Tiger Mountain, Monkey Mountain, the small animal garden, the aviary, and the antelope house. When these small creatures appear in the paddocks for the first time, they timidly hide beside their mothers, but some quickly become familiar with the environment and frolic around their mothers. Especially the little monkeys in the monkey mountain, they are always so naughty that they want to leave their mothers and run around and snatch food, but their mothers seem to be afraid that they will be bullied and hold on to their tails tightly. These interesting actions often evoke laughter from the visitors. Some visitors also curiously ask: How are these small animals bred? And how do they live in the zoo?

    It turns out that they were all born in the Beijing Zoo in 1957. Last year, the zoo bred 300-plus animals of 37 precious species, including Siberian tigers, Père David's deer (milu or "four-unlikes"), zebras, wild cattle, African lions, monkeys, otters, peacocks, and long-tailed chickens.

    To enable animals to breed in the zoo, a lot of detailed work needs to be done in terms of feeding and management. In recent years, the keepers at the Beijing Zoo have indeed put in a lot of effort. First of all, they improved the animals' feed so that each different animal can get the nutrition it needs. For example, large felines such as lions and tigers are fed not only meat but also live rabbits and green fodder (wheat seedlings). Secondly, they also increased the size of their paddocks so that they can all get enough exercise; some animals that are afraid of the cold, afraid of the heat, and like to bathe are provided with pools, heatstroke prevention, or insulation equipment. The keepers carefully observe and record the health, activity, and feeding of various animals every day. Especially when approaching the breeding season, they observe even more carefully and purposefully, so as to ensure timely mating, calculate the pregnancy date, and do a good job of isolating the animals from the male beasts before delivery. Some felines need a relatively quiet environment during the birth period; if they are frightened, they may not nurse or may bite the cubs. Last year, the lions and tigers raised in the Tiger Mountain of the zoo did not breastfeed well after their first births, and their cubs had to be artificially fed by the keepers. At first, they needed to be fed a dozen times a day, and then the number of feedings was gradually reduced. In this way, thanks to the keepers' tireless work day and night, these cubs have grown very strong.

    Currently, the zoo is using a milk dog to feed two tiger cubs. These two lively and lovely young beasts play playfully around the milk dog all day long, as if they were living by their mother's side. Now they both weigh more than twenty pounds.

    The breeding of birds is the same. In advance, different forms of bird nests, such as wooden boxes and tree holes, are placed according to the habits of various birds, hung at different heights, and some fluff and soft grass are placed indoors so that they can choose nests, build nests, and breed themselves.

    It is worth mentioning the breeding of several Père David's deer (milu or "four-unlikes") returned from the UK in 1956. This animal was originally a unique product of China, but the wild ones have long been extinct. Currently, only the Beijing Zoo raises these animals in China. Since these precious animals returned to the motherland, not only have they grown stronger than before, but they also gave birth to Père David's deer cubs last year. The fact that this endangered animal can continue to breed in the Beijing Zoo is of great significance to our future research in animal science.

    This year, the staff of the Beijing Zoo are continuing their efforts to create more breeding conditions for the animals so that they can breed in large numbers. According to the existing conditions, it is expected that more precious animals will be born in the Beijing Zoo in 1958. (Attached pictures)

    北京动物园里的新一代
    蒋绍仲
    春节以后，北京虽然还不时刮风，但是天气显然暖和多了。逛动物园的游人正在一天天地增加。那些怕冷而躲在兽室里过冬的动物，也逐渐走出了他们的暖室而进入动物运动场。
    这些关在房子里整整过了一冬的野兽，初到阳光之下显得格外活跃。这时候游人们还可以在虎山、猴楼、小动物园、鸣禽室，以及羚羊馆等地看到一些正在跟随牝兽吃奶或已经能够离开牝兽单独生活的幼小动物。当这些小生命破天荒地第一次出现在运动场上的时候，它们胆小地躲在牝兽身旁，但是也有的很快地就熟悉了环境，在牝兽身旁蹦跳地玩耍。特别是猴楼里的小猴，它们总是那样淘气地想离开牝猴单独地乱跑和抢夺食物，但它们的妈妈似乎怕它受欺而死死抓住小猴的尾巴不放。它们这些有趣的动作，不时引起游人的笑声。有的游人还好奇地问：这些小动物是怎样繁殖来的？它们又怎样在动物园里生活呢？
    原来它们都是1957年在北京动物园里出生的。去年就繁殖了东北虎、麋鹿（四不像）、斑马、野牛、非洲狮、猴、水獭、孔雀、长尾鸡等珍贵动物三十七种共三百多只。
    要想让动物能在动物园里进行繁殖，需要在饲养管理方面做很多细致的工作。几年来，北京动物园里的饲养人员的确下过一番工夫。首先改进了动物的饲料，使各种不同的动物都能够得到它所需要的营养。例如对大型狮、虎等猫科动物除了喂肉外，还喂给活兔和青饲料（麦苗）。其次还加大它们的运动场，使它们都能得到足够的运动量；对一些怕冷、怕热和喜好水浴的动物，分别设置一些水池、防暑或保温设备。饲养人员每天都仔细地观察和记载各种动物的健康、活动和吃食等情况。特别是在接近繁殖季节，更是精心用意地进行观察，使之及时交配、计算怀孕日期和作好分娩前与雄兽隔离等工作。一些猫科动物在产期内需要有比较安静的环境，如受惊吓就很可能不喂奶或咬伤幼兽。去年动物园虎山里饲养的狮子和老虎，有的第一次生产以后就不好好地哺乳，它们生育的小狮和小虎，只好由饲养员进行人工饲养。起初它们每天需要吃十几次奶，然后逐渐减少吃奶次数。就这样在饲养员日夜的辛勤劳动下，这些幼兽已长得很肥壮了。
    目前动物园正用奶狗哺育着两只小虎。这两只活泼可爱的幼兽，整天顽皮地在奶狗身旁玩耍，好像是生活在自己妈妈的身旁一样，现在它们的体重都超过了二十斤。
    鸟类的繁殖也是一样。事先按照各种鸟类的习性放置木箱、树洞等不同形式的鸟巢，挂在高低不同的地方，还在室内放置一些茸毛、软草之类，使他们自己选巢、铺窝和繁殖。
    值得一提的是1956年从英国送还的几只麋鹿（四不像）的繁殖。这种动物本来是中国的唯一特产，但是野生的早已绝迹，目前在中国只有北京动物园饲养的这几只。这些珍贵的动物自从回到祖国以后，不但长得比以前肥壮，而且在去年还生了小麋鹿。这即将绝种的动物，能够在北京动物园里继续繁殖，对我们今后研究动物科学方面有很大的意义。
    今年北京动物园里的工作人员正在继续努力，要更多地给动物创造繁殖条件，使它们能够大量繁殖。按照现有条件，预计在1958年将会有更多的珍贵动物降生在北京动物园。（附图片）
