Xinhua News Agency, March 19th, TASS Moscow, March 18th: The Central Election Commission of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has registered the election of deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in all one thousand three hundred and seventy-eight constituencies. Seven hundred and thirty-eight deputies were elected to the Union Council, and six hundred and forty to the Council of Nationalities. These figures were announced in a statement issued by the Central Election Commission of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the 18th.

According to the final statistics, the total number of voters nationwide was 133,836,325. Voters who participated in the election accounted for 99.97% of the total number of voters.

133,214,652 people in the Union Council constituencies voted for candidates of the League of Communists and non-Party People, accounting for 99.57% of the total number of voters who participated in the voting in these constituencies.

133,431,524 people in the Council of Nationalities constituencies voted for candidates of the League of Communists and non-Party People, accounting for 99.73% of the total number of voters who participated in the voting in these constituencies.

Xinhua News Agency, March 19th, TASS Moscow: Mr. Donovan, an American representative who came to the Soviet Union to understand the Supreme Soviet elections, said at a press conference on the 18th: "One can argue for hours, days, and months on the topic of which system is better, but one thing is certain: the source of the Soviet Union's enormous strength is its strong, intelligent, and tenacious people."

Donovan is an editor of the American "Fortune" magazine. He traveled to the Soviet Union with Professor Skirmon and Professor Black to observe the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections.

Donovan said at this press conference: "We have spoken with hundreds of Soviet people, and what impressed me the most was the high level of talent and high intellectual level of the Soviet people, which shows the superiority of the Soviet education system." Donovan also said that the Soviet people are a great force worthy of praise.

Skirmon and Black both expressed their agreement with Donovan's words.

Skirmon said at the meeting that during the two weeks of their stay in the Soviet Union, the American representatives visited many cities, participated in a series of pre-election meetings, visited some enterprises, and met with many leaders and many Soviet people.

Skirmon said that on election day, the American representatives visited eight electoral districts in Moscow, and the impression they got was that the Moscow elections, and thus the national elections, were very well organized.

When answering questions raised by reporters, the American representatives emphasized that the Soviet election system could not be compared with the American election system because there were profound differences between them. They pointed out that they believed in the election system practiced in the United States. The purpose of their trip was not to reach a consensus with the Soviets on the question of which system is better, but to understand the purpose and methods of the Soviet election system, to understand the dynamics of Soviet society, and thereby promote mutual understanding between the American and Soviet peoples, which is a condition for ensuring peace.

    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到苏联了解最高苏维埃选举情况的美国代表杜诺万18日在记者招待会上说：“在哪一种制度好这个题目上可以争论几小时、几天和几个月，但有一点是肯定的，那就是：苏联的巨大的力量泉源是它的强有力的、聪明的和顽强的人民。”
    杜诺万是美国“幸福”杂志编辑，他同斯凯蒙教授和布莱克教授一起来苏联旅行，参观苏联最高苏维埃选举情况。
    杜诺万在这个记者招待会上说：“我们同成百的苏联人谈过话，使我印象最深的就是苏联人的高度才干和高度智力水平，这说明苏联教育制度的优越”。杜诺万还说，苏联人民是值得赞扬的伟大力量。
    斯凯蒙和布莱克都表示同意杜诺万的话。
    斯凯蒙在会上说，在苏联逗留的两周当中，美国代表曾经访问了许多城市，参加了一系列选举前的会议，访问了一些企业，同许多负责人、许多苏联人会了面。
    斯凯蒙说，在选举日那天，美国代表访问了莫斯科的八个选区，他们得到的印象是，莫斯科的选举，因而也可以看出全国的选举，是组织得很好的。
    美国代表在回答记者们提出的问题时着重表示，不能把苏联的选举制度同美国的选举制度相比较，因为它们之间存在着深刻的区别。他们指出，他们是信仰美国实行的选举制度的。他们的旅行的目的并不是要在哪种制度更好的问题上同苏联人取得一致的看法，而是要了解苏联选举制度的目的和方法，了解苏维埃社会的动力，从而促进美国人民和苏联人民之间的相互了解，这是保证和平的条件。
