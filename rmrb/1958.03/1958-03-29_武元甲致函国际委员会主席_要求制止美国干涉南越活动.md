Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 28th: Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote a letter to the Chairman of the International Commission, G. L. Rao, on March 24th, requesting the International Commission to take active measures to stop all acts of US interference in South Vietnam.

    Vo Nguyen Giap made the following requests in the letter: (1) Stop transporting new weapons, ammunition, and war materials into South Vietnam; (2) Withdraw all US military missions and military personnel from South Vietnam; (3) Stop expanding and establishing new military bases in South Vietnam; (4) Guarantee that South Vietnam does not participate in any military bloc in any form.

    Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized in the letter that the US authorities' interference in South Vietnam is constantly intensifying. He said that thousands of American soldiers, including two hundred and eighty senior officers, are stepping up their activities in South Vietnam. In reality, they have grasped all the power of the organization, training, equipping, and deployment of the South Vietnamese army, as well as the construction of military engineering.

    Vo Nguyen Giap said that it is particularly noteworthy that the United States is building military bases on a large scale in South Vietnam. They are newly building and expanding many airports for jet aircraft use; the equipment of all naval ports has been strengthened; in various places such as Ban Me Thuot, Saigon, Bien Hoa, and Vung Tau, large-scale military bases for the United States in the Southeast Asian region are being built. A strategic highway network is under construction, the purpose of which is to connect various military bases and connect various ports with the Central Highlands military base.

    Vo Nguyen Giap said in the letter that more and more weapons, ammunition, and modern war materials are being transported by the United States into South Vietnam.

    Vo Nguyen Giap listed various facts in the letter to prove that the United States is using various means to try to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized that these illegal actions by the United States violate its obligations as one of the participating countries in the Geneva Conference, and violate its solemn guarantees at the Geneva Conference. At the same time, the South Vietnamese authorities, by allowing South Vietnam to become a US military base, have seriously violated the various provisions of the Geneva Accords, threatened the consolidation of peace in Vietnam, hindered the realization of Vietnamese reunification, and infringed upon the independence and sovereignty of the Vietnamese people. Therefore, the South Vietnamese authorities must also be held responsible for all of this.

    武元甲致函国际委员会主席
    要求制止美国干涉南越活动
    据新华社河内28日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲在3月24日写信给国际委员会主席高尔，要求国际委员会采取积极措施，制止美国在南越的一切干涉行动。
    武元甲在信中提出了下列要求：（一）停止把新的武器、弹药和战争物资运进南越；（二）把美国的所有军事代表团和军事人员撤出南越；（三）停止在南越扩大和建立新的军事基地；（四）保证南越不在任何形式下参加任何军事集团。
    武元甲在信中强调指出，美国当局对南越的干涉正在不断加强。他说，成千的美国军人，包括二百八十名高级军官正在南越加紧活动，他们实际上已经掌握了南越军队的组织、训练、装备、调动工作和军事工程建设工作的一切权力。
    武元甲说，尤其值得注意的是，美国正在南越大规模地修建军事基地，他们正在新建和扩建许多飞机场，供喷气式飞机使用；所有军港的设备都加强了；在邦美蜀、西贡、边和、头顿等各个地方，正在为美国修建它在东南亚地区的大型军事基地。战略公路网正在修建，修建公路网的目的在于把各个军事基地联结起来，把各个港口同西原军事基地联在一起。
    武元甲在信中说，美国运进南越的武器、弹药和现代化战争物资愈来愈多。
    武元甲在信中列举各种事实，证明美国正在用各种手段企图把南越拉进东南亚条约组织。
    武元甲强调指出，美国的这些非法行动违背了它作为日内瓦会议参加国之一所应担负的义务，违背了它在日内瓦会议上的庄重保证。同时，南越当局让南越成为美国的军事基地，从而严重违反了日内瓦协议的各项条款，威胁了越南和平的巩固，阻挠越南统一的实现，侵犯了越南人民的独立和主权。因此，南越当局对这一切也要负责任。
