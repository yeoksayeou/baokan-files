Xinhua News Agency, March 5th. The State Council's Science Planning Commission held its fifth meeting today, presided over by Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Science Planning Commission. The task of the meeting is to listen to and discuss the summary report of the Chinese Science and Technology Delegation's visit to the Soviet Union and to arrange the 1958 scientific research plan.

At the beginning of the meeting, Secretary-General Fan Changjiang announced the State Council's decision to remove the positions of eight members who were rightists: Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, Qian Duansheng, Chen Da, Fei Xiaotong, Li Zong'en, Yuan Hanqing, and Zhou Huiming.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Deputy Director of the Science Planning Commission, delivered a summary report to the meeting this morning on the visit of the Science and Technology Delegation to the Soviet Union. He said: The protocol signed on January 18 this year between the Chinese and Soviet governments on jointly conducting and the Soviet Union helping China conduct major scientific and technological research is of great significance. It prepares important conditions for international cooperation for the great leap forward in scientific and technological research in our country during the second five-year plan. The main contents of the protocol are to conduct comprehensive cooperation with the Soviet Union in scientific research in a more planned and focused manner; to consolidate and develop direct contacts between the scientific institutions and scientific research institutions of the two countries; to agree that the exchanges between scientists of the two countries will mainly take the form of short-term academic official trips; to solve the problem of the supply of non-commercial scientific equipment, instruments, meters, samples, materials, reagents, and small amounts of miscellaneous equipment; and to determine the overall supervision and coordination mechanism for the implementation of the protocol by the two countries, with the Chinese side being the State Council's Science Planning Commission and the Soviet side being the State Scientific and Technological Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and clearly stipulating the tasks of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee in implementing this protocol.

Guo Moruo also talked about his understanding of learning from the basic experience of the Soviet Union in developing science. He pointed out that the most basic experience of Soviet science lies in giving play to the superiority of the socialist system, and in the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Specifically, it is reflected in the following points: 1. The combination of theory and practice; 2. Focusing on key development and comprehensive arrangements; 3. The planning and coordination of scientific research; 4. Vigorously solving the problem of scientific cadres; 5. Combining teaching and scientific research; 6. Protecting schools of thought and advocating free debate in academic circles; 7. Running science diligently and thriftily; 8. Attaching importance to scientific intelligence work.

He suggested widely and deeply publicizing and introducing the achievements and advanced experience of Soviet science and technology, as well as the main contents of the agreement between the Chinese and Soviet governments on jointly conducting and the Soviet Union helping China conduct major scientific and technological research. He requested that relevant departments on our side must be well prepared to earnestly implement the cooperation projects stipulated in the agreement between the two governments. In addition, during our country's second five-year plan period, in scientific and technological research, we should resolutely adopt the policy of focusing on mastering and combining with China's actual conditions and creatively applying advanced Soviet achievements, while also paying attention to promoting our country's scientific heritage and summarizing the mass experience in our industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, we must vigorously train scientific research cadres.

Jiang Juchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, made a report entitled "Strive for a Major Development in the Cause of Philosophical and Social Science Research." He said: In terms of the organizational work of philosophy and social sciences, since the establishment of the office of philosophy and social sciences by the Science Planning Commission in October last year, three main things have been done: the planning group for the collation and publication of Chinese ancient books and the seven professional groups of philosophy, economics, history, literature, law, and education have been established successively, and some of them have begun to work; the draft outline of the twelve-year plan for philosophy and social sciences has been revised; and the key projects of philosophy and social sciences controlled by the Science Planning Commission in 1958 have been drafted. Jiang Juchen then put forward some suggestions on the future work of the Science Planning Commission in the field of philosophy and social sciences. He finally said that promoting Marxism-Leninism and criticizing bourgeois ideology are of great significance for promoting the great leap forward in production. In this respect, the philosophical and social science circles shoulder a major task. Social science workers should continue to carry out ideological criticism and self-transformation in the current rectification movement, and arouse revolutionary vigor, so that the cause of philosophy and social sciences can take a great leap forward.

Wu Heng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Science Planning Commission, reported on the research work in 1957 and explained the research plan for 1958; Feng Zhongyun and Li Da made key speeches as members.

This meeting will last for five days. More than 170 people participated, including the directors, deputy directors, members of the Science Planning Commission, representatives of local governments, representatives of relevant organs and groups, and members and advisors of the Chinese Science and Technology Delegation to the Soviet Union.

    新华社5日讯　国务院科学规划委员会第五次会议今天在国务院副总理、科学规划委员会主任聂荣臻主持下开幕。会议的任务是听取和讨论中国访苏科学技术代表团的总结报告，并安排1958年度的科学研究计划。
    会议开始时，首先由秘书长范长江宣布了国务院关于撤销右派分子曾昭抡、钱伟长、钱端升、陈达、费孝通、李宗恩、袁翰青、周慧明八人的委员职务的决定。
    中国科学院院长、科学规划委员会副主任郭沫若今天上午向会议作了访苏科学技术代表团的总结报告。他说：今年1月18日签订的中苏两国政府关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的议定书，是具有重大的意义的。它为我国在第二个五年计划期间科学技术研究工作的大跃进，准备了重要的国际合作条件。议定书的主要内容是更有计划、有重点地和苏联进行科学研究的全面合作；巩固和发展两国科学机构和科学研究机构之间的直接联系；商定两国科学家的来往主要将采取以短期学术公差为主的方式；解决了关于非商品的科学设备、器械、仪器、样品、材料、试剂以及小量零星器材的供应问题；并决定了执行议定书的两国的总的监督和协调机构，中国方面为中国国务院科学规划委员会、苏联方面为苏联部长会议国家科学技术委员会，并明确规定了中苏科学技术合作委员会在执行本议定书中的任务。
    郭沫若还谈到了对学习苏联发展科学事业的基本经验的体会。他指出苏联科学最基本的经验，在于发挥了社会主义制度的优越性，在于党的领导和马克思列宁主义思想的指导。具体表现在以下几点：一、理论和实际的结合；二、重点发展、全面安排；三、科学研究的计划性和协调工作；四、大力解决科学干部问题；五、教学和科学研究相结合；六、保护学派、提倡学术界的自由争论；七、勤俭办科学；八、重视科学情报工作。
    他建议广泛深入地宣传和介绍苏联科学技术的成就和先进经验以及中苏两国政府关于共同进行和苏联帮助中国进行重大科学技术研究的主要内容。他要求我方有关部门必须作好准备，以认真执行两国政府议定书中规定的合作项目。此外，在我国第二个五年计划期内，在科学技术的研究上应该坚决采取以掌握和结合中国实际，创造性地运用苏联先进成就为主的方针，同时注意发扬我国的科学遗产，总结我国工农业生产中的群众经验。同时，还要大力培养科学研究干部。
    国务院科学规划委员会副秘书长姜君辰作了以“争取哲学社会科学研究事业的重大发展”的报告。他说：哲学社会科学组织工作方面，从去年10月科学规划委员会成立了哲学社会科学方面的办公机构以来，主要做了三件事情：先后成立了中国古籍整理、出版规划小组和哲学、经济、历史、文学、法学、教育等七个专业小组，其中一部分已开始工作；对十二年哲学社会科学规划纲要（草案）作了修改；草拟了1958年科学规划委员会掌握的哲学社会科学重点项目。姜君辰接着对科学规划委员会今后开展哲学社会科学方面的工作提出了一些意见。他最后说，发扬马克思列宁主义、批判资产阶级思想，对促进生产大跃进是有重大意义的，在这方面哲学社会科学界担负着重大任务，社会科学工作者要在当前整风运动当中，继续开展思想批判，进行自我改造，鼓起革命干劲，使哲学社会科学事业来一个大跃进。
    科学规划委员会副秘书长武衡报告了1957年的研究工作情况和1958年的研究计划说明；冯仲云委员和李达委员作了重点发言。
