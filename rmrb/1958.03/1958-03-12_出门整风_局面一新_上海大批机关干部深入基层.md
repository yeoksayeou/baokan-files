Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 10th: Recently, a large number of Shanghai cadres have frequently stepped out of their offices and gone to grassroots units to identify problems existing in their leadership work as materials for the rectification campaign in the organs. At the same time, they have been helping the grassroots with their rectification, with good results. People call this method of rectification "stepping out for rectification."

The propaganda cadres of the Yu-lin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai, originally sitting in their offices opposing waste and conservatism, couldn't see where their own unhealthy tendencies lay; faced with the enthusiastic mass movement, they felt "unable to get involved." Later, the theory instructors of the District Committee Propaganda Department went to the State-owned Cotton Factory No. 15 and heard cadres and workers criticizing them for their boring lectures that were not related to reality. Propaganda section cadres went to the bicycle factory and saw workers creating and performing skits and rhythmic verses against waste and conservatism, in lively forms, promoting the development of the movement. These situations at the grassroots level made these cadres see the subjectivism and serious detachment from the masses and from reality, the "official air," in their past propaganda work.

Another important aspect of cadres "stepping out for rectification" is asking grassroots units to send big-character posters criticizing the leading organs to the leading organs. In recent days, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various municipal and district organs have been receiving large numbers of big-character posters from lower-level units and other units every day. The East China Textile Administration Bureau received more than 2,800 in six days.

### 出门整风  局面一新  上海大批机关干部深入基层

    出门整风  局面一新
    上海大批机关干部深入基层
    据新华社上海10日电　上海大批机关干部，近来经常走出办公室，到基层单位去找出领导工作中存在的问题，作为机关整风的材料，同时帮助基层整风，收效很好。人们把这样的整风方法叫做“出门整风”。
    中共上海榆林区委的宣传部干部，原来坐在机关里反浪费反保守，看不到自己身上的歪风在哪里；面对着热火朝天的群众运动，却感到“插不上手”。后来，区委宣传部的理论教员来到国棉十五厂，听到厂里的干部和工人批评他们讲课内容枯燥，不联系实际；宣传科干部来到自行车厂，看到工人们自编、自演的反浪费反保守活报剧和快板，形式生动活泼，推动了运动发展。基层单位这些情况，使得这些干部看到了自己以往宣传工作中的主观主义和严重脱离群众、脱离实际的“官气”。
    机关干部“出门整风”，还有另一个重要的方面，就是请基层单位把批评领导机关的大字报送到领导机关来。这几天，中共上海市委和市、区的各个机关，每天都要收到大批下级单位和别的单位送来的大字报。华东纺织管理局六天来收到了二千八百多张。
