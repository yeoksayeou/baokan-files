Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th - According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: At the meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission held at Panmunjom on the 10th at the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese sides.

Major General Jiang Shanghao, the chief commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side, strongly protested to the US side at the meeting regarding the violation of the armistice agreement by two US military jet aircraft on March 6th, which illegally flew over the Military Demarcation Line, invaded the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side, and carried out provocative and hostile acts against the Korean and Chinese side.

Major General Jiang Shanghao pointed out the course of the incident at the meeting as follows:

At about 10:12 a.m. on March 6, two U.S. military jet aircraft appeared from the U.S. side area, violated the armistice agreement, and illegally flew over the Military Demarcation Line, invading the airspace above Chusili and Wufeng in the Korean and Chinese side area. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese side carried out warning shots to make them leave the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side. However, the U.S. military aircraft ignored this and gradually penetrated the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side at low altitude, and continued to conduct planned reconnaissance activities while circling. The Korean and Chinese side had no choice but to take necessary measures for self-defense against this obvious provocative and hostile act. As a result, one of the aforementioned U.S. military aircraft was shot down within the Korean and Chinese side area. The pilot of this aircraft fell using a parachute. The other aircraft flew over the Military Demarcation Line and fled back to the U.S. side area.

The U.S.'s deliberate provocative behavior was not limited to this: Approximately thirty minutes later, two more U.S. military jet aircraft flew over the Military Demarcation Line, invaded the airspace near the location where the aforementioned aircraft was shot down, circled, conducted threatening reconnaissance activities, and set fire within the Korean and Chinese side area before fleeing back to the south. This was clearly to eliminate the evidence of their provocative crimes. Then, at about 11:25 a.m., another U.S. military helicopter flew over the Military Demarcation Line, once again invaded the airspace near the aforementioned location, conducted reconnaissance activities, and then fled.

The U.S. has repeatedly sent its military aircraft deep into the Korean and Chinese side area to conduct planned hostile acts. This is a blatant violation of the armistice agreement and a serious provocative act against the Korean and Chinese side. Jiang Shanghao revealed the purpose of the U.S. in carrying out the aforementioned hostile acts, saying that the U.S. not only refuses to emulate the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea, but instead sends aircraft to carry out such hostile acts. This is part of the action of the U.S. aggressive clique preparing to provoke a war of aggression, and its purpose is to threaten the Korean armistice and exacerbate the tense situation in Korea.

Jiang Shanghao said that since the armistice, the Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly requested the U.S. to immediately stop its hostile acts regarding the incidents of U.S. military aircraft invading the Korean and Chinese side area to conduct hostile acts, and to take effective measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. However, the U.S. has once again carried out serious hostile acts against the Korean and Chinese side.

Jiang Shanghao lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side at the meeting regarding this matter, and demanded that the U.S. immediately stop its hostile acts, severely punish the personnel involved, and take responsible measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

At the meeting, the U.S. representative admitted that two U.S. "F-86" type jet military aircraft, "during normal ground cover training" on that day, violated the armistice agreement due to "errors" and invaded the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side area, and that subsequently, two more U.S. jet military aircraft and a helicopter illegally invaded the location where the aforementioned aircraft was shot down due to the same "error." However, the U.S. attempted to portray this serious planned provocative act that violated the armistice agreement as if it were "not a deliberate act of aggression," and reversed black and white, calling the Korean and Chinese side's legitimate defense measures "improper acts of attack," falsely accusing the Korean and Chinese side of attempting to deceive world public opinion. The U.S. also fabricated some baseless "incidents" in order to cover up its crimes, slandering the Korean and Chinese side.

Jiang Shanghao pointed out that the U.S. has continuously sent military aircraft to invade the Korean and Chinese side to conduct hostile acts since the armistice. The Korean and Chinese side has already brought up 588 incidents involving 1,231 sorties to the U.S. The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly warned the U.S. to immediately stop its hostile acts and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, but the U.S. continues this behavior. In particular, the hostile acts carried out by the U.S. military aircraft this time are deliberate provocative acts that have been planned and organized. This time, it not only invaded the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side area more than once, but also carried out provocative and hostile acts multiple times.

Jiang Shanghao pointed out that under these circumstances, it is completely justified for the Korean and Chinese side to take necessary self-defense measures.

At the meeting, the U.S. requested the repatriation of the aforementioned U.S. military aircraft pilot who landed in the Korean and Chinese side area. Major General Jiang Shanghao pointed out regarding this matter that the pilot is currently receiving humanitarian treatment from the Korean and Chinese side, and his health is very good. We will hand him over to the U.S. side when we are ready.

When the U.S. side was in a predicament under the resolute claims and legitimate accusations of the Korean and Chinese side, it attempted to evade the issues raised by the Korean and Chinese side and deceive public opinion, and once again raised the issue of the South Korean civilian airliner that defected to the north on February 16th. In addition, it also raised the so-called "prisoner of war issue." Major General Jiang Shanghao pointed out that these accusations by the U.S. are merely fabrications for its own despicable purposes. He reiterated that the issue of the defector aircraft has nothing to do with the Military Armistice Commission. He said that the U.S. is not qualified to talk about any issues related to prisoners of war at all until it has made a responsible account for the large number of detained Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

Finally, Major General Jiang Shanghao pointed out that any fabrications by the U.S. cannot cover up the U.S.'s crimes of seriously violating the armistice agreement, and the U.S. cannot shirk the responsibility it should bear.

Major General Jiang Shanghao warned the U.S. side that if the U.S. ignores the warnings of the Korean and Chinese side and dares to once again send aircraft to invade the airspace of the Korean and Chinese side to conduct provocative acts, the Korean and Chinese side will take resolute self-defense measures, and the U.S. side will bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom. Major General Jiang Shanghao said, I once again request that your side strictly abide by all the provisions of the armistice agreement, immediately stop provocative and hostile acts, severely punish the relevant U.S. personnel in accordance with the armistice agreement, and take responsible measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th - Just as the Chinese People's Volunteers are actively preparing to withdraw from Korea for the sake of peace, what are the U.S. and Rhee forces doing in South Korea? At 10:12 a.m. on March 6, two jet aircraft of the U.S. aggressor army illegally invaded the airspace above the position of a certain Guards Division of the Korean People's Army, and one of them was immediately shot down by our anti-aircraft fire, and the pilot who attempted to escape by parachute was captured alive.

On the evening of March 1, a special agent who had received special training from the U.S. intelligence agency was captured in front of the forward position of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He was personally assigned the task by the U.S. special agent battalion commander - to scout the deployment and important information of the Korean and Chinese troops. Military items such as telescopes, cameras, and compasses were found on this guy.

More noteworthy is that after the joint statement of the Korean and Chinese governments and the news of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea this year were announced, the Rhee Syngman army has been conducting large-scale "mobile exercises" on the southern edge of the Military Demarcation Line for days. The U.S. and Rhee forces are also setting fires to mountains and beating drums there, carrying out provocations and harassment against the Korean and Chinese troops.

    朝中方面在军事停战委员会会议上
    强硬抗议美机挑衅
    新华社平壤11日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会由朝中方面建议，10日在板门店举行了会议。
    朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将在会上就美方军用喷气式飞机两架在3月6日违反停战协定非法飞过军事分界线，侵入朝中方面地区上空，并且对朝中方面进行挑衅性的敌对行为，向美方提出了强硬抗议。
    姜尚昊少将在会上指出事件经过如下：
    3月6日上午十时十二分许，美方军用喷气式飞机两架从美方地区出现，违反停战协定，非法飞过军事分界线，侵入朝中方面地区初西里和鹫峰上空，因此，朝中方面进行警告性的射击，使它们离开朝中方面地区上空。但是美方军用飞机不但置之不理，反而以低空飞行逐渐深入朝中方面地区上空，并且盘旋着继续进行有计划的侦察活动。朝中方面对于这种明显的挑衅性的敌对行为，不得不采取必要的措施进行自卫。结果，上述的美方军用飞机中有一架被打落在朝中方面地区内。这架飞机的驾驶员利用降落伞落下。另一架飞机飞过军事分界线逃回美方地区。
    美方的蓄意挑衅行为还不限于此：大约经过三十分钟，又有美方军用喷气式飞机两架飞过军事分界线，侵入上述打落飞机的地点附近的上空盘旋，进行威胁性的侦察活动，并且在朝中方面地区内放火，然后逃回南方。这分明是为了消灭它们挑衅性的罪证。接着，在十一时二十五分许，又有美国军用直升飞机一架飞过军事分界线，再次侵入上述地点附近上空，进行侦察活动后逃走。
    美方这样屡次使它的军用飞机深深地侵入朝中方面地区，进行有计划的敌对行为，这是对停战协定的粗暴违反，对朝中方面的严重挑衅行为。姜尚昊揭露美方进行上述敌对行为的目的说，美方不但拒绝仿效中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退来促进朝鲜的和平统一，反而派飞机来进行这种敌对行为，这是美国侵略集团准备挑起侵略战争行动的一部分，其目的在于威胁朝鲜的停战，加剧朝鲜的紧张局势。
    姜尚昊说，朝中方面自从停战以来，屡次就美方军用飞机侵入朝中方面地区进行敌对行为的事件要求美方立即停止敌对行为，并且采取有效措施保证不再发生类似事件。但是美方这次却又一次对朝中方面进行了严重的敌对行为。
    姜尚昊在会上就此向美方提出强硬抗议，并且要求美方立即停止敌对行为，严惩有关人员，采取负责措施保证不再发生类似事件。
    在会上，美方代表承认：美方F—86”型喷气式军用飞机两架在当天“进行正常的对地面掩护训练时”，因“错误”而违反停战协定，侵犯了朝中方面地区上空，随后还有美方喷气式军用飞机两架和直升飞机因同样“错误”非法侵犯了上述飞机被击落地点。但是美方企图把这次严重违反停战协定的有计划的挑衅行为，说成好像“不是蓄意的侵犯行为”，并且颠倒黑白地把朝中方面正当的防卫措施说成是“不当的攻击行为”，反诬朝中方面企图欺骗世界舆论。美方还为了掩盖它的罪行，捏造一些毫无根据的“事件”，中伤朝中方面。
    姜尚昊指出：美方在停战后不断地使军用飞机侵犯朝中方面进行敌对行为。已经由朝中方面向美方提出过的就有五百八十八起，一千二百三十一架次。朝中方面每次都警告美方立即停止敌对行为，保证类似的事件不再发生，但美方仍然继续这种行为，特别是这一次美方军用飞机进行的敌对行为，是已经计划好和组织好的蓄意的挑衅行为，这次是不止一回地侵犯了朝中方面地区上空，而且多次地进行挑衅性敌对行为。
    姜尚昊指出：在这种情况下，朝中方面采取必要的自卫措施完全是正当的。
    在会议上，美方要求遣返上述降落在朝中方面地区内的美方军用飞机的驾驶员。姜尚昊少将就这件事指出，那个驾驶员目前受到朝中方面的人道主义的待遇，他的健康状况很好。等我们准备好，就把他交给美方。
    美方在朝中方面的坚决的主张和正当的指责下陷入窘境时，企图回避朝中方面提出的问题和欺骗社会舆论，又一次提出了2月16日起义飞抵北部的南朝鲜民航机的问题。另外它还提出了所谓“战俘问题”。姜尚昊少将指出：美方的这些指责不过是为自己的卑鄙目的而捏造出来的。他再次指出，起义飞机的问题是和军事停战委员会无关的。他说，美方在没有对大量扣留的朝中方面战俘作出负责交代以前，根本就没有资格谈任何有关战俘的问题。
    最后，姜尚昊少将指出，美方的任何虚构捏造都掩盖不了美方严重违反停战协定的罪行，美方也不能推卸它应负的责任。
    姜尚昊少将警告美方说，如果美方不顾朝中方面的警告，胆敢再一次派飞机侵犯朝中方面的领空，进行挑衅行为，朝中方面将采取坚决的自卫措施，而由此发生的一切后果应由美方负完全责任。姜尚昊少将说，我再次要求你方严格遵守停战协定的一切条款，立即停止挑衅性的敌对行为，根据停战协定严惩有关美方人员，采取负责的措施保证不再发生类似事件。
    新华社平壤11日电　正当中国人民志愿军为着和平而积极准备撤离朝鲜的时候，美李军在南朝鲜作些什么呢？3月6日上午十时十二分，美国侵略军的两架喷气式飞机，非法侵入朝鲜人民军某近卫师团的阵地上空，当即被我高射炮火击落其中的一架，并活捉企图乘降落伞逃生的飞机驾驶员。
    3月1日傍晚，在中国人民志愿军某阵地前沿，捉到一受过美国情报机关专门训练的特务，他是由美国特务大队长亲自面授任务——刺探朝中部队的部署和重要情况。在这个家伙身上搜出望远镜、照相机、指南针等军用物件。
    更值得注意的，在朝中政府联合声明和中国人民志愿军今年全部撤离朝鲜的消息公布后，李承晚军却在军事分界线南缘，连日进行着大规模的“机动演习”。美李军还在那里放火烧山和擂鼓，向朝中部队进行挑衅和骚扰。
