We Cannot Sit and Wait for Steel and Cement
    Tian Lianqian

    One of the practical difficulties encountered in current farmland water conservancy construction is the shortage of cement and steel. To overcome this difficulty, on the one hand, it is necessary to allocate the limited amount of cement and steel to the most essential water conservancy projects; on the other hand, it is necessary to rely on the farmers themselves to come up with more ideas and use all materials that can replace steel and cement to ensure the timely completion of the projects.

    Can farmers themselves come up with ways to use less or no steel and cement? Can the use of "local" materials that replace steel and cement ensure the quality of water conservancy projects? Regarding this question, the masses have given a positive answer with many successful creations. The creations of the farmers in Andong County, Liaoning Province, are very worthy of attention. The farmers in Andong County used yellow earth and rice straw instead of steel and cement to build the spillway of the reservoir. They also used wooden tubes instead of cement pipes and rough logs as sluice gates. The county used these cheap substitute materials to build more than 600 reservoirs, with a cost of only 3.3 yuan per mu of paddy field. After a year of testing, these projects did not have any problems.

    Similar creations have appeared in many other places. For example, in 1956, Nankang Township in Guangxi Province used burnt brick powder to replace cement to repair the inclined pipes and horizontal pipes of four water conservancy projects, and these projects withstood the test of floods. This township continued to use burnt bricks instead of cement to build water conservancy projects last winter and this spring. The sluice gates manufactured with sandy conglomerate by the Fugang Tenth Cooperative in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, are of good quality and were praised by Soviet experts who visited not long ago. In Neihuang County, Henan Province, reed mats are commonly used to replace palm fiber and hemp threads and willow branches are used to replace iron wire in well-digging, saving 40 jin of palm fiber and 24 jin of thick and thin iron wire for every ten zhang (approx. 33 meters) deep well, saving a total of 47 yuan. Hongchun Agricultural Cooperative in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, built water cellars on the hillside to store water, opening the cave doors to release water for irrigation, which not only does not require any materials, but also saves the most water. These are just examples, and the substitute materials and material-saving methods found by the masses are definitely not limited to these few.

    In some places, in the work of water conservancy construction, they always reach out to the state for steel and cement, thinking that without these things, the project would be completely impossible to build. Now they should draw useful lessons from these facts to build and strengthen their mass line ideology, and believe that as long as the enthusiasm of the masses is mobilized, all obstacles on the road forward can be overcome. Anything can be accomplished as long as the broad masses are determined to do it.

    Some "experts" may shake their heads and laugh at the idea of using yellow earth and rice straw to replace steel bars and cement, thinking that this is just propaganda. We also admit that yellow earth and rice straw cannot replace steel bars and cement in all construction projects. However, in certain specific projects, yellow earth and rice straw have indeed shouldered the heavy responsibility of steel bars and cement for a certain period of time, bringing water conservancy to farmland and increasing grain production for farmers and the country. Who can deny the facts? "Perhaps these projects will have problems in a very short time and need to be reinforced or partially rebuilt?" Very likely. However, our country has abundant labor force, why not give full play to our favorable conditions? Isn't this better than sitting and waiting for steel and cement and letting time pass in vain?

    不能坐等钢筋水泥
    田连阡
    目前农田水利建设上碰到的实际困难之一，是水泥和钢铁不足。要克服这个困难，一方面是要把数量有限的水泥和钢铁分配给最必需的水利工程；另方面是要靠农民自己多想办法，利用一切可以代替钢铁和水泥的材料，保证工程按时竣工。
    农民自己能够想出少用或不用钢铁和水泥的办法吗？使用代替钢铁和水泥的“土”材料能够保证水利工程的质量吗？关于这一问题，群众用许多成功的创造作了肯定的回答。辽宁省安东县农民的创造，就很值得重视。安东县农民不用钢筋和水泥，而用黄土和稻草来修筑水库的溢洪道。他们还用木筒代替水泥管，用粗圆木作闸门。全县就是利用这些廉价的代用材料，建成了六百多座水库，每亩水田的成本只要三元三角。经过一年的考验，这些工程并没有出问题。
    类似这样的创造，别的地方也出现了不少。比如广西省南康乡1956年用烧砖粉代替水泥修补了四处水利工程的斜管和卧管，这些工程都经受住了洪水的考验。去冬今春这个乡继续采用烧砖代替水泥来兴修水利工程。安徽省阜阳县阜光十社用砂礓制造的闸门，质量良好，不久以前曾经受到前往参观的苏联专家的称赞。河南省内黄县在打井下泉方面，普遍用苇篾代替棕，用麻经和柳条代替铁丝，每下十丈深的泉可节省棕四十斤，粗细铁丝二十四斤，共可节省四十七元。山西省永济县红春农业合作社在山坡上修水窑洞蓄水，打开洞门就放水浇地，不但不用任何材料，而且最能节省用水。这些只是例子，群众找到的代用材料和节省材料的办法决不止这几种。
    有些地方在兴修水利工作中，总是伸手向国家要钢材，要水泥，以为没有这些东西，工程就完全无法修建。现在他们应当从这些事实中吸取有益的教训，来建设和加强自己的群众路线思想，相信只要发动起群众的积极性，就能够克服前进道路上的一切障碍。任何事情只要广大群众决心去做，就没有做不成的。
    对于黄土和稻草代替钢筋和水泥，有一些“专门家”也许会摇头发笑，认为这只是宣传。我们也承认黄土和稻草不可能在一切工程建筑上都代替钢筋水泥。但是在某些具体工程上说，黄土和稻草却硬是已经在一定的期间内担负了钢筋水泥所担负的重任，给农田带来了水利，给农民和国家增产了粮食，谁能否认事实？“也许在很短的时间以后这些工程就会出毛病，需要加固或部分地重修吧？” 很可能。但是，我们国家有的是劳动力，为什么不充分发挥我们的这个有利条件呢？这难道不比坐等钢筋水泥、让时间白白流走好一点么？
