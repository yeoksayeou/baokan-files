Current Issues to Note in Agricultural Production
Rice Seedling Cultivation - A Crucial Link for Increasing Early Rice Yield

Around "Jingzhe" (Awakening of Insects), the southern provinces are in the tense phase of spring plowing, and early rice is about to be sown.

This year, the area of double-cropping rice has increased unprecedentedly, and the area of early rice is expected to be much larger than in previous years. In Sichuan, for example, the early rice planting area this year will increase by nearly two times compared to last year's eight million mu. Provinces such as Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan also have similar situations. Some areas that have not developed double-cropping rice due to temporary difficulties in water conservancy and fertilizer supply, or lack of labor, have also changed medium rice to early rice in order to produce more grain and expand multiple cropping, striving to plant another season of late autumn crops.

The main purpose of expanding early rice is to plant another season and produce more grain. Therefore, expanding the early rice area not only requires a good harvest of early rice but should also strive for early planting and early harvesting to leave sufficient time for the next season's crops to grow and develop, achieving a full year's harvest.

In the past, early rice sowing in the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin was around "Qingming" (Tomb Sweeping Day). In fact, in Jiujiang County of Jiangxi Province, and in some areas of Lishui, Yunhe, and Longquan counties of Zhejiang Province, there was experience in sowing half a month earlier, around "Chunfen" (Vernal Equinox). This experience proves that, under the existing conditions, it is entirely possible to appropriately advance the early rice sowing period. Of course, early sowing also has drawbacks. In the past, some areas experienced seedling rot due to early sowing.

The specific requirements for advancing the early rice sowing period are to sow early and prevent seedling rot. Is there a way to do this? Yes, various places have some methods. The "compromise seedling cultivation method" adopted by Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, and other provinces in the past two years is one of the better experiences. In 1957, Liaoning Province promoted the "compromise seedling cultivation method" on more than 280,000 mu in twenty-five key paddy field counties. The promotion results also proved that early sowing using this method increased production by 10%-20% compared to water-cultured seedlings, and it can avoid seedling rot and cotton rot disease. These situations indicate that both southern and northern regions can adopt the "compromise seedling cultivation method" to advance the sowing period, adapting to local conditions.

This year, many areas in the south have promoted a large amount of Japonica rice. Areas that introduce early Japonica rice should further grasp the characteristics that the northward movement of northern Japonica will lead to earlier maturity and that Japonica rice is more cold-resistant than Indica rice. Referring to the climatic conditions of the original planting areas, they should advance sowing in order to successfully achieve the purpose of introducing early Japonica.

    当前农业生产上应注意的问题
    早稻增产的重要环节——育秧
    “惊蛰”前后正是南方各省春耕紧张阶段，早稻就要播种了。
    今年双季稻的面积空前大增，早稻的面积预计要比往年多很多。以四川来说，今年早稻播种面积，就比去年的八百多万亩增加近两倍。湖北、安徽、浙江、江西、湖南等省也都有类似的情况。一些因为水利、肥料供应暂时还有困难，或者劳动力缺乏而没有发展双季稻的地区，为了多打粮食，扩大复种，也有不少把中稻改为早稻，争取多种一季晚秋。
    扩大早稻的目的，主要是为了多种一季，多打粮食。所以扩大早稻面积不仅要求早稻丰收，还应该争取早种早收，给下一季作物留下充分生长发育的时间，达到全年丰收。
    过去，长江流域各省早稻播种，都在“清明”前后，其实在江西省的九江县，浙江省的丽水、云和、龙泉等县部分地区，都有提前半个月在“春分”前后播种的经验。这个经验证明，在现有的条件下，适当地提早早稻播种期，是完全可能的。当然早播也有缺点，过去有些地区就发生过因为早播而烂秧的情况。
    既要早播，又要防止烂秧，是提早早稻播种期的具体要求。有没有办法这样作呢？有，各地都有一些办法。浙江、江苏、安徽、四川等省近两年来所采用的“折衷育苗法”，就是其中一个比较好的经验。1957年辽宁省在二十五个水田重点县，推广了“折衷育苗法”共计二十八万多亩，推广结果，同样证明用这种方法早播，比水育秧苗增产10％—20％，而且可以避免烂秧和绵腐病。这些情况说明：不论南方、北方，都可以因地制宜地采用“折衷育苗法”来提早播种期。
    南方不少地区，今年推广了大量粳稻，引种早粳稻的地区，更应掌握北粳南移将会提早成熟和粳稻比较籼稻耐寒的特点，参照原种植地区的气候条件，提早播种，以圆满达到引种早粳的目的。
