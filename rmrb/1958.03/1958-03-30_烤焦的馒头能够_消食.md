Why?

    Burnt Mantou Can "Aid Digestion"
    Why can burnt mantou, corn bread, and other foods "aid digestion"?
    When suffering from indigestion, it is often due to excessive acid secretion in the stomach. At this time, doctors often prescribe a type of tablet made from charcoal powder to patients. Because charcoal powder is loose, it has many pores. After the tablet disperses into charcoal powder in the stomach, it can appropriately absorb some of the gastric acid into its pores. In chemistry, this action is called "adsorption."
    After mantou, corn bread, and other foods are burnt, the burnt part turns into charcoal. According to the principle that charcoal can absorb stomach acid, its "digestion-aiding" effect is obvious. Of course, after flour-based foods are burnt, some of the nutrients will be damaged, but localized burning does not have a significant impact on it. (Fu)

    烤焦的馒头能够“消食”
    烤焦的馒头、窝头等食品能够“消食”，为什么呢？
    当消化不良时，往往由于胃里分泌的酸液过多。这时医生常会给患者服用一种用炭末压成的药片。因为炭末质松，其中有很多孔隙。药片在胃里分散成炭末之后，便能适当地将一部分胃酸吸在它的孔隙之中，在化学上把这种作用叫作“吸附”。
    馒头、窝头等食品烤焦后，其烤焦的部分就是变成了炭。根据上述炭能吸附胃酸的原理，其“消食”的作用便是明显的事了。当然面食经过烤焦，其中的营养成分也会遭到一些破坏，但是局部的烤焦对于它的影响不大。　（夫）
