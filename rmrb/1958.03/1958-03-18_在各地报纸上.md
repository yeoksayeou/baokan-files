    Hui County – A County Teeming with Pregnant Livestock
    Amidst the Great Leap Forward, Hui County, Henan Province, has reported the good news of teeming pregnant livestock. The county currently has over 9,000 pregnant female animals, accounting for over 86% of the total number of suitable female animals, basically achieving a county where "every female animal is pregnant." The Henan Daily on the 13th, on its third page, focused on reporting this major event. The newspaper published the Henan Provincial People's Committee's instructions on organizing a Great Leap Forward in livestock development, reported on Hui County's experience, and also published an editorial titled "Achieve 100 Days of Non-Empty Pregnancy for Female Animals," calling on various localities to learn from Hui County's experience as a pioneer in the Great Leap Forward in livestock and to launch a new high tide of breeding and developing livestock on a province-wide scale.

    Powerful Support
    The Dazhong Daily published an attractive piece of news on the 14th: Hebei, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces have sent over 1,000 farmer technicians and technical cadres to Shandong to impart rice planting techniques. They have already arrived one after another. Most of the farmer technicians are directors and production team leaders of local agricultural cooperatives. They will be stationed in key rice-growing cooperatives for a year, providing comprehensive technical guidance. Rice technical cadres from Jiangsu will assist the Shandong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences in establishing a rice department to conduct experimental research on rice production. The Dazhong Daily published an editorial expressing a warm welcome to these rice-growing experts who have come from afar to support Shandong in carrying out production reforms.

    A Significant Initiative
    On the 11th, the Zhejiang Daily reported on its front page that the Huangyan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently formulated the "Huangyan County 1958 Rice and Sweet Potato Technical Operating Procedures." These operating procedures were formulated based on the requirement of achieving the target of a thousand-jin county this year, summarizing the experience of thousand-jin cooperatives throughout the county, and after being appraised by experts. Now, the Huangyan County Committee is organizing the broad masses of cadres and cooperative members to earnestly study and discuss them. The County Committee also requires all districts, townships, and cooperatives to formulate their own 1958 rice and sweet potato technical operating procedures based on the specific conditions of their respective regions through discussions of the county's operating procedures. The Zhejiang Daily highly praised Huangyan County's approach. A newspaper commentator published an article, considering it a "significant initiative."

    Protecting Seedlings Like Nurturing Infants
    The weather is currently fluctuating between warm and cold, and the transplanted seedlings urgently need good protection. The New Hunan Daily introduced relevant experiences in a timely manner on the 15th. Members of the Dabai Agricultural Cooperative in Liuyang County put forward the slogans "Protecting Seedlings is Like Protecting Life" and "Protecting Seedlings is Like Nurturing Infants," and implemented a production responsibility system for cultivating strong seedlings. Some cooperatives also require seedling shelters on every plot and seedling protectors in every team.

    辉县——母畜满怀县
    在大跃进声中，河南辉县传来了母畜满怀的喜讯。这个县现有怀胎母畜九千多头，占适龄母畜总数86％以上，基本上实现了“母畜满怀”县。13日的河南日报三版集中报道了这件大事，报纸发表了省人民委员会关于组织牲畜发展大跃进的指示，报道了辉县的经验，还发表了“百日实现母畜不空怀”的社论，要求各地学习牲畜大跃进先行者辉县的经验，掀起一个全省规模的繁殖发展牲畜的新高潮。
    有力的支援
    大众日报14日刊出了一条吸引人的消息：河北、江苏、安徽三省派出一千多名农民技术员和技术干部，到山东传授种稻技术。他们已经先后到达。农民技术员中大部分是当地农业社的主任、生产队长，他们将以一年为期，固定在种植水稻的重点社，进行全面的技术指导。来自江苏的水稻技术干部，将帮助山东省农业科学研究所建立水稻系，进行水稻生产的试验研究工作。大众日报发表社论，对这些不远千里而来支援山东进行生产改革的种稻能手们，表示热烈的欢迎。
    重大的创举
    11日，浙江日报一版头条报道，中共黄岩县委最近订出了“黄岩县1958年水稻和甘薯技术操作规程”。这个操作规程是根据今年实现千斤县指标的要求，总结了全县千斤社的经验，并经过专家的鉴定后订出来的。现在黄岩县委正组织广大干部、社员认真学习讨论。县委并要求各区、乡、社通过讨论县的操作规程，根据本地区的具体情况，订出自己的1958年水稻、甘薯技术操作规程。浙江日报对黄岩县的做法评价很高，报纸评论员发表文章，认为这是一个“重大的创举”。
    护秧如育婴
    现在的天气忽暖忽冷，对于已插的秧苗，急需好好保护。15日的新湖南报适时地介绍了这方面的经验。浏阳县大白农业社的社员们提出了“保苗如保命”“护秧如育婴”的口号，并实行了培育壮秧的生产责任制。还有些合作社要求丘丘有护秧棚，队队有护秧员。
