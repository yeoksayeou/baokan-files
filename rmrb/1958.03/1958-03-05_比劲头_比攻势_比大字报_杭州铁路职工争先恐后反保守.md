Hangzhou, March 4th (reporter Tu Zhengfeng): More than ten thousand employees in the Hangzhou area of the Shanghai Railway Administration are competing with each other to fiercely attack waste and conservative phenomena.

Each section, station, team, and the Party committee organs are igniting and promoting each other, launching a "six competitions" race: "competing in action, competing in drive, competing in offensive," and "competing in writing more, competing in writing faster, competing in writing more widely." The workers of the locomotive section proposed to post 22,000 big-character posters and guarantee their quality. They used this target to challenge everyone. Nansingqiao Station responded the same day by writing more than 5,000 big-character posters. From February 27th to the morning of March 2nd, this station had already posted more than 153,000 big-character posters exposing, criticizing, suggesting, and guaranteeing. The workers of the First Work Zone of the Third Engineering Team proposed to increase production and save the country's wealth equivalent to 5,000 taels of gold in 1958. They also guaranteed to not take a single piece of wood, add a single person, and excavate the wood from the wooden bridge piers built twenty years ago to complete the engineering tasks.

Through extensive airing of views and free debate, many previously revised leap forward targets have been repeatedly broken. The workers proposed to achieve a daily production of one million ton-kilometers by this year's "May Day" Labor Day. Three train crew groups also responded to the challenge of the Mao Zedong locomotive group, striving to achieve a daily production of 1.8 million ton-kilometers this year. The recently drafted train schedule by the Railway Bureau stipulates that the travel time of ordinary express trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line will be shortened from the original four hours and four minutes to three hours and twenty-two minutes; special express trains will be reduced from the original three hours and twenty-two minutes to two hours and fifty-seven minutes. On the 1st, the 28th special express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai, driven by the Yang Deming crew, actually ran sixteen minutes ahead of the new target.

    比劲头　比攻势　比大字报
    杭州铁路职工争先恐后反保守
    本报杭州4日电　记者屠正峰报道：上海铁路管理局杭州地区的万余职工互相竞赛，向浪费和保守现象展开猛攻。
    各段、站、队和党委机关等互相点火，互相促进，掀起了“比行动、比劲头、比攻势”“比写多、比写快、比写广”的“六比”竞赛。机务段职工提出要张贴二万二千张大字报，并且要保证质量。他们用这个指标向大家挑战。南星桥站当天就写了五千多张大字报应战。从2月27日到3月2日上午，这个站已经贴出揭露、批判、建议和保证的大字报十五万三千多张。第三工程队第一工区职工提出1958年内要为国家增产节约价值五千两黄金的财富，并且保证在今年内不领一根木头，不增添一个人，挖出二十年前建筑的废木桥桥墩的木料，来完成工程任务。
    通过大鸣大放，许多原来已经修改过的跃进指标一再被突破。职工们提出：在今年“五一”劳动节实现日产百万吨公里。有三个包乘组还响应毛泽东号机车组的挑战，争取在今年内作到日产一百八十万吨公里。最近路局新拟的列车运行图，规定沪杭线上普通快车的行驶时间，由原来的四小时零四分缩短到三小时二十二分；特别快车由原来的三小时二十二分缩减到二小时又五十七分。1日，由杨德明机班驾驶的从杭州开往上海的二十八次特别快车，实际运行时间比新指标又提早了十六分钟。
