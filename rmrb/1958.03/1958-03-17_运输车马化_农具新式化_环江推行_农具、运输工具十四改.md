Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 15th: Huanjiang County, Guangxi, is launching a "Fourteen Transformations of Agricultural Tools and Transportation" campaign, requiring the realization of horse-powered transportation vehicles by the end of this month and the modernization of agricultural tools this year.

In the first five days of March, the county's one hundred and eight townships organized more than five hundred carpenters and blacksmiths to manufacture eighty-nine handcarts, eighty-three horse-drawn and ox-drawn carts, three soil pulverizers, and eighty-nine wheelbarrows. Three hundred horse carts and seventy-seven double-wheeled double-share plows, which had long been sleeping in warehouses, have been snapped up by agricultural cooperatives.

In order to achieve the increased production target of 800 jin of grain per mu this year, Huanjiang County plans to expand the replanting area by 103,000 mu, with an average application of 700 to 800 dan of fertilizer per mu. Therefore, the labor shortage is prominently felt. After calculation, the spring plowing and fertilizer transportation alone will be short 410,000 workdays.

At the beginning of March, the Huanjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a representative meeting of leading cadres of various townships and cooperatives, as well as carpenters and agricultural tool craftsmen. The meeting introduced the experience of Chuanshan District in reforming agricultural tools and transportation vehicles, and unified ideological understanding through on-site demonstrations and debates. The meeting decided to supplement and revise the "Ten Transformations" of Chuanshan District into "Fourteen Transformations." These "Fourteen Transformations" are: 1. Change human plowing to ox plowing (some mountainous areas still use human labor for plowing); 2. Change foot plows and soil plows to double-wheeled double-share plows, 53-step plows, and light plows; 3. Change human soil breaking and soil rake breaking to soil pulverizers and Yangtao rollers for soil breaking; 4. Change shoulder carrying and human back carrying to human pushcarts and ox- and horse-drawn carts (mountainous areas use horse transport); 5. Change manual sowing to sowing machine sowing; 6. Change small roads to vehicle roads; 7. Change small sickles to large sickles (for cutting grass); 8. Change small hoes to large hoes; 9. Change sickle harvesting of grains to saw-sickle harvesting of grains; 10. Change grain threshing barrels to stone roller threshing and threshing machine threshing; 11. Change manual inter-tillage to animal-powered inter-tillage implement inter-tillage; 12. Change manual corn kernel removal to corn threshing machine kernel removal; 13. Change human rice milling to water mill rice milling; 14. Change knife cutting of pig feed to vine cutting machine cutting of pig feed.

After the meeting, various townships quickly formulated specific plans and actively promoted the "Fourteen Transformations."

Now, the county has decided to manufacture 15,000 various wooden carts before the spring plowing, requiring an average of one wheelbarrow or two-wheeled cart for every two households by the end of March; before June this year, an average of one oxcart for every five head of cattle, one horse cart for every horse, and one soil pulverizing rake and one harrowing machine for every thirty mu of land.

### 运输车马化　农具新式化  环江推行“农具、运输工具十四改”

    运输车马化　农具新式化
    环江推行“农具、运输工具十四改”
    据新华社南宁15日电　广西环江县正开展“农具、运输工具十四改”运动，要求本月底实现运输车马化，今年实现农具新式化。
    在3月上旬的五天内，全县一百零八个乡组织了木匠、铁匠共五百多人，制造手推车八十九架，马拉、牛拉车八十三架，碎土机三架，独轮车八十九架。长期以来困睡在仓库里的三百架马车和七十七部双轮双铧犁已被农业社抢购一空。
    环江县为实现今年每亩产粮八百斤的增产计划，计划扩大复种面积十万三千亩，每亩平均施肥七、八百担，因此，突出的感到劳动力不够用。经过计算，仅春耕运肥一项就少四十一万个劳动日。
    3月初，中共环江县委召开了各乡社主要负责干部和木匠、农具手参加的改良农具、运输工具的代表会议，会上介绍了川山区改革农具、运输工具的经验，并通过现场表演和辩论，统一了思想认识。会议决定将川山区的“十改”补充修改为“十四改”。这“十四改”是：一、改人犁田为牛犁田（部分山区现在还是用人力犁田）；二、改脚犁、土犁为双轮双铧犁、五三步犁、轻便步犁；三、改人碎土、土耙碎土为碎土机、洋桃滚碎土；四、改肩挑、人背为人推车、牛马拉车（山区用马驮）；五、改人工播种为播种机播种；六、改小路为车路；七、改小镰刀为大镰刀（割草）；八、改小锄头为大锄头；九、改镰刀割谷为锯镰割谷；十、改打谷桶打谷为石滚滚谷、打谷机打谷；十一、改人工中耕为畜力拉中耕器中耕；十二、改人手脱玉米粒为玉米脱粒机脱粒；十三、改人舂米为水碾碾米；十四、改刀切猪菜为切蔓机切猪菜。
    会后，各乡迅速订出具体计划，积极推行“十四改”。
    现在，全县决定在春耕前制成各种木车一万五千架，要求3月底平均每两户有一辆独轮车或双轮车；今年6月以前，平均每五头耕牛有一辆牛车，每一匹马有一辆马车，每三十亩地有一架碎土耙、一架耙田机。
