    促进东西方贸易　加强相互了解
    来比锡国际博览会开幕
    本报综合报道　来比锡春季国际博览会，1日晚在来比锡开幕。在市中心和郊区，上百的大小展览馆已于2日晨向来自七十多个国家的五十万参观者开放了。参加这次博览会的有四十一个国家的九千多个展出单位。
    在今晚举行的博览会开幕典礼上，德意志民主共和国副总理兼对外和东西德贸易部部长海因里希·劳在开幕词中指出：这次博览会是历来规模最大和有着重大意义的一次，因为它是在世界两大阵营的力量对比发生了决定性变化和美国及其他西方国家开始出现经济危机和萧条迹象以后举行的。他说：扩大东西方贸易的时机已经完全成熟了。
    这次博览会展出总面积是二十八万七千平方公尺，比去年增加了一万二千平方公尺。德意志民主共和国展出面积为二十万平方公尺。
    苏联是两个德国以外最大的展出者，展出面积为一万二千平方公尺。中国馆今年的展出面积为四千平方公尺。
    来比锡春季国际博览会的中国馆2日上午迎接了民主德国的党和政府领导人乌布利希、劳·马特恩和艾伯特等以及各国政府代表团。中国政府代表团团长王国权和中国展览团团长文士桢陪同贵宾们参观了一小时之久。
    参观后，乌布利希等在留言簿上题了词。乌布利希写道：“这次展览表明了中国人民的伟大技术成就。我们期望中国工人阶级和中国人民在祖国的经济建设方面取得更进一步的成就。”（附图片）
