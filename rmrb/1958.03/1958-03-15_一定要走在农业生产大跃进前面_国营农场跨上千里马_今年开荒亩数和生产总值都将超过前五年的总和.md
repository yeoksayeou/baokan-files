Xinhua News Agency, March 14th - This year, the cultivated acreage and total production value of state-owned farms in the national agricultural reclamation system will exceed the total of the past five years.

From February 26th to March 8th, the Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation convened a ten-day, vigorous production leap forward meeting in Beijing for socialist activists from state-owned farms. Agricultural reclamation enterprises - state-owned agriculture equipped with modern technology - have mounted the swift horse and are poised for a rapid leap forward during the Second Five-Year Plan. A great leap is to be taken this year. According to the targets proposed by more than 400 representatives at the meeting: this year, the state-owned farms in the agricultural reclamation system are to cultivate 15 million mu of wasteland (the original plan was 7 million mu), produce 3 billion jin of grain, 1 million dan of cotton, 450 million jin of soybeans, sell 400,000 head of fattened pigs, and a large number of other agricultural and livestock products. The total production value is to reach more than 1 billion yuan. In the past five years, the total amount of wasteland reclaimed was only 13 million mu, and the total production value was only 1 billion yuan.

The Ministry of Agricultural Reclamation originally planned to increase the cultivated area from 40 million mu to 60 million mu during the Second Five-Year Plan without increasing state investment. At this meeting, the representatives proposed to strive to cultivate 82 million mu of wasteland with the original investment amount (equivalent to the total cultivated area of Japan), so that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the cultivated area of state-owned farms would reach 100 million mu or more.

At this meeting, many representatives put forward ambitious slogans, saying: State-owned agriculture must be at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Among the 710 farms and ranches across the country, 330 farms had representatives at the meeting, and 250 of them proposed to achieve grain yields of 450-500-800 jin per mu this year. Among them, 20 farms are to become "thousand-jin farms," and 36 farms are to cross the Yangtze River this year. Loss-making farms proposed to turn into profitable ones this year and provide accumulation for the country this year.

This meeting, in the form of small-scale forums and big-character posters, launched an anti-waste, anti-conservatism campaign, comparing energy, technology, and leap forward, and exchanged various experiences in running farms and production. At the meeting, farms in the suburbs of Tianjin and Beijing, farms in the South and farms in the North, Xinjiang Military Reclamation Farms and Heilongjiang Mishan area Railway Corps Farms, livestock farms in the Northwest and livestock farms in Inner Mongolia, etc., launched a leap forward competition in terms of land reclamation, increasing yields, diversified operations, reducing land reclamation investment, reducing production costs, providing more agricultural and livestock products to the country, and handing over more profits to the country. Many reclamation areas proposed to reduce the cost of land reclamation to 20 yuan per mu or even less, and many farms proposed that as long as the state invests in the funds for 20,000 mu in the first year, the farm itself can rely on production accumulation to complete construction within three or five years. Comparing leap forward in land reclamation, leap forward in production increase, and diligent and thrifty farm management became the three major centers of the meeting. Finally, the meeting decided to implement a red flag competition in national farms. Farms that reach grain yield targets of 400-500-800 jin and an average cotton yield of more than 100 jin per mu will get the red flag. Those who cross this target will get the outstanding red flag, those who double cross at once (such as farms in the 400-jin area reaching 800 jin) will get the leap forward red flag, and the farm with the highest yield among all farms will get the great leap forward red flag.

On March 8th, a "Great Leap Forward" red flag more than one zhang long was inserted on the rostrum. Under this banner that guides hundreds of thousands of workers in national state-owned farms and ranches to bravely move forward, all the representatives listened to Vice Chairman Zhu De's speech and the summary report of Wang Zhen, Minister of Agricultural Reclamation. Vice Chairman Zhu De called on everyone to be pioneers in building the rich and vast border areas of the motherland, demobilized officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to make contributions to reclamation, and create a new world. Wang Zhen pointed out in his summary report: Many leap forward targets put forward at this meeting are based on the targets that advanced producers have already achieved. Therefore, under the spirit of opposing conservative ideas and implementing more, faster, better, and more economical results, we will definitely be able to give full play to revolutionary energy and collective wisdom and strive to achieve the leap forward production targets. Wang Zhen called on national state-owned farms to conscientiously implement the policy of diligent and thrifty farm management and diversified operations, and to widely develop forestry, aquaculture, breeding production, especially the processing industry combined with the raw materials of the farm, on the basis of abundant agricultural and livestock production. He asked the farms to further mobilize the masses to oppose waste and conservatism, mobilize the masses to burn "five airs" to fully exert the potential for increasing production and revolutionary energy.

    一定要走在农业生产大跃进前面
    国营农场跨上千里马
    今年开荒亩数和生产总值都将超过前五年的总和
    新华社1 4日讯  全国农垦系统国营农牧场今年的开荒亩数和生产总值，都将超过过去五年的总和。
    2 月26日到3月8日，农垦部召集国营农牧场的社会主义积极分子在北京开了十天轰轰烈烈的生产跃进会议。农垦企业——用现代化技术装备的国营农业跨上了千里马，要在第二个五年计划期间飞速跃进。今年就要大跃一步。根据会上四百多代表提出的指标：今年农垦系统的国营农牧场要开荒一千五百万亩，（原计划是七百万亩）生产粮食三十亿斤、棉花一百万担、大豆四、五亿斤、出售肥猪四十万头以及大量的其他农、畜产品，生产总值要达到十亿元以上。而过去五年的开荒总数才一千三百万亩，生产总值才十亿元。
    农垦部原计划在第二个五年计划期间，在不增加国家投资的情况下，开荒由四千万亩增加到六千万亩。这次会上，代表们提出要用原投资数目争取开荒八千二百万亩（相当于日本全国的耕地面积），使第二个五年计划结束时，国营农牧场的耕地面积达到一亿亩或一亿亩以上。
    这次会上，不少代表提出豪迈的口号说：国营农业一定要走在农业生产大跃进的前面。全国七百一十处农牧场，有代表到会的三百三十个农场中，提出要在今年达到粮食亩产四百五十—五百—八百斤指标的就有二百五十处。其中有二十处要成为千斤场，有三十六处场要在今年跨过长江。赔本的农场提出一定要在今年转为有利，一定要在今年为国家提供积累。
    这次会议以小型座谈会和大鸣大放大字报的形式，展开了反浪费、反保守、比干劲、比技术、比跃进，并交流了办场和生产的各种经验。会上，天津市郊场和北京市郊场、南方的场和北方的场、新疆军垦农场和黑龙江密山地区铁道兵农场、西北的畜牧场和内蒙古的畜牧场等等，分别在开荒、提高产量、多种经营、降低开荒投资、降低生产成本、为国家多提供农畜产品、为国家多上缴利润等等方面，展开了跃进竞赛。不少垦区提出要把开荒成本降低到每亩二十元甚至二十元以下，不少农场提出开垦十万亩地只要国家在第一年投入两万亩的资金，农场本身就可依靠生产积累限期三年或五年建成。比开荒跃进、比增产跃进、比勤俭办场成了会上的三大中心。最后，会议决定全国农场实行红旗竞赛，凡达到粮食四百—五百—八百斤指标、棉花平均亩产达一百斤以上的场得红旗，跨过这个指标的得优胜红旗、一次双跨的（如四百斤地区的场达到了八百斤）得跃进红旗，全部农场中产量最高的得大跃进红旗。
    3月8日，一杆一丈多长的“大跃进”红旗插上了主席台。就在这杆引导全国国营农牧场数十万职工奋勇前进的大旗之下，全体代表听了朱德副主席的讲话和农垦部部长王震的总结报告。朱德副主席号召大家作建设祖国富饶的广大边区的先锋，解放军复员官兵开垦立功，创造新的世界。王震在总结报告中指出：这次会上提出的许多跃进指标都是有根据的，是先进生产者已经达到了的指标。因此，在反对保守思想贯彻多快好省的精神下，就一定能够发挥革命干劲和集体智慧，争取生产跃进指标的实现。王震号召全国国营农牧场认真贯彻勤俭办场和多种经营的方针，在以农牧为主的丰产基础上广泛发展林业、水产、饲养生产特别是与本场原料结合的加工业等等。他要求各场进一步发动群众反浪费和反保守，发动群众烧掉五气，来充分发挥增产潜力和革命干劲。
