Dengfeng County, Henan Province's Experience in Eliminating the Four Pests, transmitted by Xinhua News Agency.

Dengfeng County, nestled at the foot of Mount Song, has basically eliminated the four pests across its 1,200 square kilometers.

Currently, the intensive pest elimination and hygiene campaign has passed its peak in this county, and a system has been established in half of the areas. Most of the people understand general hygiene knowledge, and 100,000 people have developed the habit of brushing their teeth. 80% of the townships have bathhouses, and daily cleaning has become a habit for the masses. The toilets, kitchens, and wells in this county have all been improved, and strict cleaning and management systems have been established for garbage, sewage, and feces, fundamentally eliminating all conditions for breeding mosquitoes and flies. Now, every household has fly swatters, and every household has rat traps, rat poison, and mosquito repellent. A comprehensive network for eliminating the four pests has been formed here. Once the four pests appear, they can be immediately eliminated. Currently, the entire county is carrying out a "six checks and six comparisons" movement between townships, between communes, and between teams, namely: checking sanitation and comparing production; checking the results of pest elimination and comparing cleanliness; checking the seven improvements and comparing fertilizer accumulation; checking the prosperity of both people and livestock and comparing the reduction of diseases; checking hygiene propaganda and comparing adherence to the system; and checking the diligence and thrift in running hygiene undertakings and comparing the invention and creation of pest elimination tools. They have implemented various systems such as monthly evaluations between townships, bi-monthly evaluations between teams, and daily cleaning duties by each production team and urban residential area.

How does this county lead the county-wide pest elimination and hygiene campaign?

First, the combination of the pest elimination and hygiene campaign with production is the key to whether the movement can be carried out smoothly and sustained. After the draft of the National Agricultural Development Program was published in 1956, they proposed the slogan: "Starting from production, eliminate the four pests to reduce diseases; starting from fertilizer accumulation, change environmental sanitation to broaden fertilizer sources." In the leadership of the county party committee, they also adopted the "seven unified" leadership method that combined hygiene and production, namely: "unified planning, deployment, organization, action, inspection, reporting, and evaluation." All members of the county party committee grasp pest elimination work and inspect environmental sanitation when inspecting work below. Each commune and team includes sanitation work as an item when regularly evaluating production results, and cleanliness and hygiene are also important conditions when selecting production models. Because the leadership closely integrates pest elimination and sanitation work with production, this movement has become a broad, deeply rooted mass movement. When eliminating pests, the masses throughout the county universally proposed: "Good hygiene, strong body, sufficient fertilizer, more grain." They also created nine digging and eight padding (digging and padding millstones, toilets, walls, cattle, sheep pens, etc.), five sweeping and five cleaning (sweeping streets, courtyards, living rooms, walls, and dead corners of roof beams), seven improvements (improving toilets, kitchens, chicken coops, etc.), and four peeling and four replacing (peeling century-old walls, twenty-year-old old walls, three-year-old stoves, five-year-old earth beds) and other methods that combine hygiene and fertilizer accumulation. Last winter and this spring, the county's sanitary fertilizer accumulation reached more than 60 million dan, and various diseases have also decreased year by year. The people have strengthened their physical fitness, and the labor attendance rate has increased year by year. In the past three months, the labor attendance rate of various agricultural cooperatives in the county has reached 100%. The county's grain output has also increased year after year. In 1952, the county's yield per mu was 193 jin, while last year, despite suffering from a severe drought unseen in decades, the yield per mu was still 315 jin. Facts have proved that where sanitation work is done well, both people and livestock are prosperous, and production increases year after year. Jingdian Township, the first "four-without" township in the county, has jumped from a third-class township to a first-class township. The main reason is that the incidence of various diseases in this township has decreased by 98%. The labor attendance rate has remained at 97% in the past two years. 98% of the livestock regularly maintain first-class fatness. The grain produced by sanitary fertilizer accumulation in this township for four years is enough for the commune members of the entire township to eat for a year. Daye Town, known as "hygienic fertilizer accumulation increases production," has increased its fertilizer application due to the development of the sanitation movement. From a town that lacked 250,000 jin of grain in 1955, it jumped to a surplus grain town selling more than 500,000 jin of surplus grain in 1956. The masses reflected: "Production drives sanitation, and sanitation supports production."

Second, vigorously support the advanced, advocate where there is advanced experience, establish flags there, and universally use the mass methods of on-site visits, on-site evaluations, summarizing experiences, and comprehensively promoting them to catch up with and learn from the advanced. In the past year, the Dengfeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized more than 120 county-wide evaluations and visits, and countless others were organized by various districts and townships themselves. Through visits, the situation that had been stuck on several points for a long time was broken through. Chen Jinsheng from Beigou Township, a family of 32 people, was a famous "outhouse" in the township. After he visited Jingdian Township, he mobilized his entire family to clear 800 dan of decades-old garbage from his home day and night. The commune rated him with 1,000 points. He jumped to become a first-class sanitary model household in the township.

Third, rely on the masses and run sanitation undertakings diligently and thriftily. At the beginning of the movement, the masses said: Doing sanitation is a great thing, as long as it doesn't cost money. According to the requirements of the masses, they divided sanitation work into three categories: those that support production without spending money and are quick to profit, do first and do more; those that require spending some money, but the masses are currently facing economic difficulties, do less or postpone; those that cost a lot of money and are slow to profit, do not do or postpone. Public sanitation facilities are run by the commune, and household sanitation facilities are run by the members. The tens of thousands of improved toilets and newly built bathhouses in the county were all built using old bricks and broken tiles. 80% of the fly swatters in Jingdian Township, a model sanitation township, are made of rags or broken socks. Zhen Fuyou, a sanitation model, created 28 kinds of pest elimination tools, all of which were replaced by bricks, basins, cans, and wooden boxes, and none of them were purchased with money.

Fourth, fully carry out ideological mobilization, vigorously promote and mobilize, constantly overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, and always stand at the forefront of the movement. This county was known for its poverty, dirt, and diseases before liberation. 30% of the labor force was bedridden year-round, and the masses' feudal superstitious thinking was also very serious. Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, the masses were universally mobilized to complain about the suffering of diseases, the suffering of the four pests, calculate the losses caused by the four pests, and break the masses' superstitious thinking of seeking gods when sick. The deeds of advanced townships and communes where both people and livestock were prosperous were compiled into stories in a timely manner, and publicity was carried out throughout the county, launching voice and debate. Commendation meetings were also held in a timely manner to fully utilize newspapers, broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, folk schools, and all propaganda forces that could be utilized to launch a propaganda campaign for the great march towards the four pests.

When the county's pest elimination movement formed a climax, they revised the plan three times in a timely manner. Last November, the county party committee proposed to become a "four-without" county in 1958. In less than a month, sanitary fertilizer accumulation exceeded the county party committee's proposed annual target of 20 million dan. The county party committee immediately studied this leaping forward situation, criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, and proposed the goal of becoming a "four-without" county in June this year. It was soon broken through by the masses. The county committee then proposed to become a "four-without" county in February. In less than a week, the various indicators were broken through by the heroic actions of the masses. The process of the county party committee leading the movement to leap forward again and again is a process of constantly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking.

    “四无”县
    ——登封河南省登封县除四害经验介绍
    嵩山脚下的登封县，已经在全县一千二百多平方公里的面积上，基本消灭了四害。
    目前，这个县的除四害讲卫生突击时期已经过去，一半地区形成了制度化；大部分群众懂得一般卫生知识，有十万人养成了刷牙的习惯；80％的乡有了浴池，每天打扫已经成为群众的习惯。这个县的厕所、厨房、水井都经过了改良，垃圾、污水、粪便建立了严格的清除管理制度，孳生蚊蝇的一切条件已经基本消灭。现在家家有蝇拍，户户有老鼠夹、鼠药、蚊药，这里已经形成了一个除四害的天罗地网，四害一出现，就能立即消灭。现在，全县正在开展一个乡与乡，社与社，队与队的六查六比运动，即查卫生比生产；查除四害战果比清洁；查七改良比积肥；查人畜两旺比疾病减少；查卫生宣传比坚持制度；查勤俭办卫生事业比除四害工具的发明创造。他们已经实行乡与乡一月一评比，队与队半月一评比，各生产小组与城镇居民点每日清洁值日等各种制度。
    这个县是怎样领导全县除四害讲卫生运动的呢？
    第一，除四害讲卫生运动和生产相结合是运动能不能顺利开展和持续下来的关键。1956年农业发展纲要草案公布后，他们提出：从生产出发，消灭四害，以减少疾病；从积肥入手，改变环境卫生，以广辟肥源的口号。在县委领导上也采取了卫生和生产相结合的七统一的领导方法，即：“统一计划、布置、组织、行动、检查、汇报、评比”。所有县委委员在下边检查工作时都抓除四害工作，和检查环境卫生。各社队在定期评比生产成绩时，卫生工作列为一项，评选生产模范时，清洁卫生也是重要的条件之一。由于领导上在掌握除四害卫生工作上紧密结合着生产，因此就使得这一运动成为一个广阔的、深入人心的群众性运动。全县群众在除四害时普遍提出：讲卫生、身体强，肥料足、多打粮。并且还创造了九挖、八垫（挖垫磨道圈、厕所围墙、牛、羊圈等），五扫、五清（清扫街道、院落、住室、墙壁、屋梁死角），七改良（改良厕所、厨房、鸡窝等）和四扒四换（扒百年墙、二十年旧墙、三年锅台、五年土炕）等卫生和积肥相结合的办法。去冬今春，全县的卫生积肥就达到了六千多万担，各种疾病也逐年减少，人民增强了体质，劳动出勤率年年上升，在这三个多月来，全县各个农业社的劳动出勤率都达到了百分之百。全县的粮食产量也年复一年的提高，1952年全县亩产一百九十三斤，而在去年虽遭受了几十年未有的大旱灾，但亩产仍有三百一十五斤。事实证明，哪里卫生工作做得好，哪里就人畜两旺，年年增产，全县最早出现的四无乡景店乡从三类乡一跃成为一类乡，主要原因就是这个乡各种疾病的发病率减少了98％。劳动出勤率近两年都保持在97％。牲口98％经常保持一等膘。这个乡四年卫生积肥所增产的粮食够全乡社员吃一年。有“卫生积肥增产”之称的大冶镇，由于卫生运动的开展，施肥量增加，由1955年缺粮二十五万斤的镇，在1956年就一跃而为卖余粮五十余万斤的余粮镇。群众反映：“生产带动了卫生，卫生支持了生产”。
    第二，大力支持先进，提倡哪里有先进经验，就在哪里树立旗帜，并且还普遍运用了就地参观，就地评比，总结经验，全面推广的群众性的赶先进、学先进的方法。一年来，中共登封县委曾组织全县规模的评比、参观一百二十多次，各区乡自己组织的不计其数。通过参观，把长期胶着在若干点上的局面突开了。北沟乡有个陈金升，一家三十二口人，是乡里有名的“茅厕缸”，他到景店乡参观回来后，动员全家一昼夜清除家中几十年的垃圾八百担，社里给他评了一千分。一跃成为全乡一等卫生模范户。
    第三，依靠群众，勤俭办卫生事业。运动初期，群众说：搞卫生是件大好事，只要不花钱就行。根据群众的要求，他们把卫生工作分成三类：支援生产不花钱、获利快的，先办而且多办；需要花一部分钱，目前群众经济有困难，少办或缓办；花钱多获利慢，不办或暂时不办。公共性的卫生设置由社办，家庭卫生设置由社员办。全县改良的几万个厕所和新建的澡堂都是利用旧砖破瓦修建的。卫生模范乡景店乡80％的蝇拍是用破布或破袜制成的。卫生模范甄富有创造了二十八种除四害工具，都是用砖、盆、罐、木匣代替的，没有一种是花钱购置的。
    第四，充分的思想发动，大张旗鼓的宣传动员，不断克服右倾保守思想，始终站在运动前面。这个县解放前，以穷脏病多闻名，常年有30％的劳动力卧病不起，群众的封建迷信思想也很严重，因此在运动初期就普遍发动群众诉疾病苦，诉四害苦，算四害造成的损失账，和破除群众有病求神的迷信思想。及时把先进乡、社人畜两旺的事迹编成故事，在全县进行宣传，展开鸣放和辩论。并且及时召开庆功表模大会，充分利用报纸、广播、黑板报、民校和一切能够利用的宣传力量，展开向四害大进军的宣传声势。
    当全县除四害运动形成高潮时，他们及时修改了三次规划。去年11月县委提出1958年成为四无县，不到一个月，卫生积肥超过了县委提出的全年两千万担任务的要求。县委马上研究这种跃进的形势，批判了右倾保守思想，提出今年6月成为四无县的奋斗目标。不久即被群众突破。县委会又提出2月成为四无县，不到一个星期，各项指标又被群众的英雄行动突破了。县委领导运动跃进再跃进的过程就是不断克服右倾保守思想的过程。
