    Increase Production of Industrial Food, Guarantee Needs of All Parties
    Coal Production This Year Exceeds 160 Million Tons
    (Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Coal Industry recently formulated this year's increase production and economize plan, the whole year to increase production and economize 230 million yuan, producing coal 168 million tons, an increase of more than 17 million tons than the state stipulated plan, an increase of more than 38 million tons than the national actual output last year.
    The Ministry of Coal Industry's 1958 increase production and economize plan was formulated under the situation where the national coal mine workers' upsurge of anti-waste, anti-conservatism, comparing advanced, comparing enthusiasm is rising. At the beginning of this year, after the Ministry of Coal Industry's plan was issued, many mining bureaus used leaping plans to break through the Ministry's set targets, and in the process of compiling the plan, they broke through at each level and improved step by step. Jiaozuo Wangfeng Mine proposed that the efficiency of all employees (the average output of production personnel and non-production personnel per working day) is 1.8 tons, if all the country's coal mines follow their example, this year can increase production of 19.3 million tons of coal. Fuxin and Fushun competed with each other and repeatedly broke through the original targets set by the Ministry. The targets of Kailuan Coal Mine have also leapt forward again and again. The output of these three mines this year can exceed the originally planned production level for 1962. Zibo, Huainan, Hegang, Pingxiang, Jiawang and other mining bureaus can also reach the production level of the last year of the original second five-year plan this year. Workers of the Datong Mining Bureau also proposed to "catch up with Kailuan and chase Fushun," and strive to increase production by more than 40% compared with last year.
    This year's leap forward target for local coal mines is 43 million tons, an increase of 45% compared with last year. Guangdong has always been considered a coal-deficient province. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee made a comprehensive plan for the development of local coal mines, and this year's coal production can reach 1.68 million tons, an increase of 93% compared with last year. Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry also sent working groups to Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi and other provinces to understand the situation and assist in the development of the coal industry in various places. The Ministry is also preparing to convene a meeting of the directors of the industry departments of six provinces, including Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi, to jointly study and formulate long-term plans for the coal industry and accelerate construction issues.
    Geological, design, and construction departments have also proposed leap forward targets to ensure the rapid development of the coal industry.

### 增产工业食粮　保证各方需要  今年产煤一亿六千多万吨

    增产工业食粮　保证各方需要
    今年产煤一亿六千多万吨
    本报讯　煤炭工业部最近订出了今年的增产节约计划，全年要增产节约二亿三千万元，生产煤炭一亿六千八百多万吨，比国家规定的计划增加一千七百多万吨，比去年全国实际产量增加三千八百多万吨。
    煤炭工业部1958年的增产节约计划，是在全国煤矿职工反浪费、反保守、比先进、比干劲的热潮风起云涌的形势下制定的。今年年初，煤炭工业部的计划下达后，许多矿务局都用跃进的计划突破了部定的指标，在编制计划时，层层突破，步步提高。焦作王封矿提出全员效率（生产人员和非生产人员每一工作日的平均产量）是一点八吨，如果全国煤矿都向他们看齐，今年就可以增产一千九百三十万吨煤。阜新、抚顺互相竞赛，一再突破部里原定的指标，开滦煤矿的指标也一再跃进。这三个矿今年的产量就可以超过原定的1962年的生产水平。淄博、淮南、鹤岗、萍乡、贾汪等矿务局也可以在今年内达到原定的第二个五年计划最后一年的生产水平。大同矿务局职工也提出要“赶开滦，追抚顺”，争取比去年增产40％以上。
    今年地方煤矿的跃进指标是四千三百万吨，比去年增加45％。广东过去一向被认为是缺煤省份，最近广东省委对发展地方煤矿作了全面规划，今年煤炭产量就可达到一百六十八万吨，比去年增加93％。最近，煤炭工业部还派工作组到湖南、广西、江西等省了解情况，协助各地发展煤炭工业。这个部还准备召开湖北、河南、山东、四川、甘肃、陕西等六个省工业厅长会议，共同研究制定煤炭工业远景规划和加速建设的问题。
    地质、设计、施工部门也提出了保证煤炭工业迅速发展的跃进指标。
