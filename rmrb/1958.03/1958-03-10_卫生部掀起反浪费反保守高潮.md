    Ministry of Health Launches High Tide of Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Health has vigorously launched a movement against waste and conservatism. Under the slogan of comparing with the advanced, comparing with drive, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, all staff members have set off a high tide of airing views. From February 28th to March 8th, 4,086 people in the units directly under the ministry posted more than 166,000 big-character posters. Everyone's enthusiasm has been boosted. On the regular Sunday holiday on March 2nd, no one was willing to rest. Every day, they were busy writing big-character posters until after midnight.

    The problems exposed by the masses are very extensive, and the criticisms are also very sharp. They launched a siege against the serious bureaucratic airs, stagnant airs, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness existing in the leaders at all levels of the ministry, departments (bureaus), etc., and exposed the many serious waste phenomena and conservative ideas that are bound to standing still existing in the leaders at all levels, all of which are closely related to the "five airs."

    The reason why the Ministry of Health was able to launch a high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservative movement this time is inseparable from the determination of the leading comrades to set themselves on fire. In order to strive for a great leap forward in health work, the leading comrades of the ministry demanded that all staff members offer opinions to the leadership to achieve "three breaks" (break the official airs, break the personal feelings, break all kinds of signboards) "three wants" (want to humbly listen to everyone's criticisms, want to correct their shortcomings and mistakes with practical actions, want to be an ordinary state worker) "one give" (give out one's heart). At the same time, the leading comrades of the ministry, from Minister Li Dequan, the Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Ministry of Health and Deputy Minister Xu Yunbei to the heads of various departments and bureaus, also wrote more than 300 big-character posters, taking the lead with practical actions.

    卫生部掀起反浪费反保守高潮
    本报讯　卫生部反浪费、反保守运动猛烈展开。全体工作人员在比先进、比干劲、学先进、赶先进的口号下，掀起了鸣放高潮。从2月28日起至3月8日止，该部直属单位四千零八十六人，就贴出了十六万六千多张大字报。大家的干劲鼓起来了，3月2日的星期例假，没有一个人肯休息。每天直到夜半以后还忙着写大字报。
    群众所揭发出来的问题非常广泛，批评的也很尖锐，对部、司（局）等各级领导上所存在的严重的官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气进行围攻，揭发各级领导上所存在的许多严重浪费现象和裹足不前的保守思想，都是与“五气”密切相联的。
    卫生部这次所以能够掀起反浪费反保守运动的高潮，这与领导同志下了引火烧身的决心是分不开的。为了争取卫生工作的大跃进，部的领导同志要求全体工作人员对领导上提意见要做到“三破”（打破官架子，打破情面，打破各种招牌）“三要”（要虚心听取大家的批评，要用实际行动改正自己的缺点和错误，要做一个普通的国家工作人员）“一交”（把自己的心交出来）。同时，部的领导同志，从部长李德全，中共卫生部党组书记、副部长徐运北直到各司、局长还写了三百多张大字报，以实际行动带动大家。
