Pruning Must Be Done Properly

The trees in Laoshan (west of Babaoshan) in the western suburbs of Beijing will be affected in terms of health and timber yield due to improper pruning methods.

The overlapping branches of the Laoshan trees are sawn off with a saw. The friction between the saw and the tree generates heat and electricity, causing the bark and wood at the saw cut to lose vitality and rot. Moreover, the sawn surface is bumpy, easily retaining rainwater, sand, and pests. If, after sawing off the overlapping branches, the saw cut is immediately leveled and smoothed with an axe or knife, leaving no bumps or "X" marks, the new bark around the saw cut can grow and close within one or two years, leaving no trace. This will not only avoid the harm of insects and sand, strengthen the health and timber yield of the trees, but also be beautiful and neat, especially suitable for roadside and park forests. Now is the pruning season, so I would like to offer this suggestion for everyone's reference.

### 整枝要得法

    整枝要得法
    北京西郊老山（八宝山西首）的林木，由于剪枝方法不对，将影响到树木的健康和成材率。
    老山林木的骈枝，是用锯锯掉的。锯和树，由摩擦发热而生电，以致锯口部分的树皮树质，失去生活力而枯死腐朽。并且受锯的那一面，疙?疙瘩的，容易存留雨水、沙土和害虫。如果在锯掉骈枝后，随即将锯口用斧或刀砍平削光，不留一个疙瘩，不留一处“×”口，锯口周围的新皮，一二年内就可成长合口，不留痕迹，不仅可以避免虫、沙的危害，加强了树木的健康力和成材率；并且美观整齐，尤其适合于道路林、公园林的标准。现在正值整枝时期，特提出这个意见，供大家参考。
