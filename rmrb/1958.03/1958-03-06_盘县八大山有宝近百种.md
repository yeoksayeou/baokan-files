    Pan County's Badashan Mountains Have Nearly 100 Kinds of Treasures
    (By our newspaper) The Pan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Guizhou Province organized a survey of local and special products and discovered ninety-five kinds of local and special products in Badashan. Eighty percent of these products were previously undiscovered or underutilized, and are urgently needed industrial raw materials for the country. For example, there are more than 5,000 lacquer trees, of which 80% have not been tapped; bamboo fiber can produce more than one million catties annually, which is one of the main special products of Badashan, and can be used to make 330,000 reams of paper; mountain pepper, a high-grade aromatic oil material, has a yield of about 20,000 catties. In addition, forty kinds of medicinal materials that the commercial sector had not previously dealt with were also discovered.
    Badashan is located in the north of Pan County, about eighty li from the county seat. The mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and the wind is very strong, so few people go up there.

    盘县八大山有宝近百种
    本报讯　贵州盘县供销合作社组织土特产品普查，在八大山发现九十五种土特产品。这些产品，有80％是过去从未发现过或未充分利用，而又是当前国家很需要的工业原料。如生漆就有五千多株，其中有80％是应割而未割过的；竹麻每年可产一百多万斤，是八大山的主要特产之一，可造纸三十三万多刀；高级芳香油料山苍子，产量约二万多斤。此外，还发现了过去商业部门没有经营过的药材四十种。
    八大山位于盘县北面，离县城约八十华里，山高坡陡，风也很大，因此很少有人上去。
