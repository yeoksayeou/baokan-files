Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Representatives from film studios in Beijing, Shanghai, Changchun, Guangzhou, and Xi'an issued a call to action for increased production and thrift to film workers nationwide at the National Film Production Promotion Conference held on the 27th by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. The call stated that as the great leap forward is occurring everywhere on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, film workers should also exert their efforts, catch up quickly, and make the film industry leap forward accordingly, so as to coordinate with and support socialist construction and strive for the arrival of a cultural construction upsurge.

The call put forward that these film studio production workers must resolutely overcome bourgeois ideology and oppose extravagance and waste, implement the policy of running undertakings diligently and thriftily, and making film production serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; vigorously increase film production, and guarantee and improve film quality. The already formulated great leap forward plan for increased production and thrift shows that these film studios have decided, while vigorously streamlining institutions and personnel and sending cadres to lower levels, to fully exploit the potential of manpower and material resources, and increase this year's feature film production target from the original 52 to 75, an increase of 35 over last year. Complete 14 large-scale documentaries and large-scale science education films this year, an increase of 9 over last year; 78 short science education films, an increase of 46 over last year; the production targets for short documentaries, newsreels, and art films have also been greatly increased.

The call hopes that film workers will pay attention to saving film production costs, reduce film costs, and increase profits remitted to the state. These film studios have decided to reduce the cost of each black and white feature film from an average of 210,000 yuan to an average of less than 140,000 yuan this year, and other film types will generally be reduced by 20% to 30%. They also plan to save the state a total of 6.7 million yuan in production costs this year.

The call appeals to film workers to carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the Chinese progressive film industry of working hard and diligently, break with conventions, improve labor organization and management systems, and promote a continuous work system or two-shift or three-shift system according to production characteristics, in order to fully exploit the utilization rate of machinery, equipment, and sound stages, and shorten film production time. The call also hopes that film work leaders will go to factories and workshops to strengthen specific leadership and cultivate experimental plots to promote the great leap forward in the film industry.

The conference, which began on the 25th in Beijing, ended on the 27th. The film studio directors, creative personnel, and technicians from various places attending the conference launched a socialist competition to compare advanced experiences and work enthusiasm. Some screenwriters said they were prepared to write two scripts in one year, and some directors said they would shoot more than two feature films in one year. Each film studio has formulated great leap forward targets for increased production and thrift. Several film studios in Shanghai called the conference to say that these studios had decided to reduce the cost of feature films from the currently planned 145,000 yuan to 130,000 to 135,000 yuan. The conference also received many congratulatory letters and pledges from the workers of the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, the Beijing Film Studio, and the August First Film Studio, who expressed their determination to complete this year's great leap forward production tasks in a way that is plentiful, good, fast, and economical, and proposed to launch a friendly competition with brother factories.

Vice Minister of Culture Qian Junrui, Vice Minister Xia Yan, and Director of the Film Bureau Wang Lansi addressed the delegates during the conference. Qian Junrui encouraged film workers nationwide to promote the great leap forward in the film industry with practical actions, using the 36 characters of "Exert effort, strive for advancement, compare quantity and speed, compare quality and thrift, increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, be both red and expert, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Qian Junrui also hoped that film art workers would resolutely implement the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in their work, promote film creation, further improve the ideological and artistic quality of films, increase subjects reflecting socialist construction and the real life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and fight against all unhealthy and wrong tendencies.

    电影工作者响起了进军的号角
    让全国人民看到更多的好电影
    据新华社28日讯　北京、上海、长春、广州、西安等地电影制片厂的代表27日在文化部电影事业管理局召开的全国电影制片生产促进会议上，向全国电影工作者发出了增产节约的倡议书。倡议书写道，当工农业生产战线上到处出现大跃进的伟大时刻，电影工作者也应鼓足干劲，急起直追，使电影事业相应地跃进，以配合和支援社会主义建设，争取文化建设高潮的到来。
    倡议书提出，这些电影厂的制片工作者要坚决克服资产阶级思想和反对铺张浪费现象，贯彻勤俭办事业、使电影生产为工农兵服务的方针，大力增加影片生产，保证和提高影片质量。已经制定的增产节约大跃进规划表明，这些电影厂决定在大力紧缩机构和人员、下放干部的情况下，充分发挥人力物力的潜力，将今年艺术片的生产任务从原定的五十二部跃进到七十五部，比去年增加了三十五部。在今年中完成大型纪录片和大型科学教育片十四部，比去年增加九部；短科学教育片七十八部，比去年增加四十六部；短纪录片、新闻杂志片、美术片的生产指标也有很大提高。
    倡议书希望电影工作者注意节约制片生产费用，降低影片成本，增加上缴利润。这些电影制片厂已经决定在今年中将每部黑白艺术片的成本从平均二十一万元降到平均十四万元以下，其他片种普遍降低20％到30％。他们还计划在今年中总共为国家节省生产费六百七十万元。
    倡议书号召电影工作者发扬中国进步电影事业穷干、苦干的革命传统，打破常规，改进劳动组织和管理制度，按生产特点提倡摄制工作的连续工作制或二班、三班制，以充分发挥机器设备和摄影棚的利用率，缩短影片摄制时间。倡议书还希望电影工作的领导人下厂、下车间加强具体领导，搞试验田，以推动电影事业的大跃进。
    这次会议是从25日起在北京召开的，已经在27日结束。出席会议的各地电影制片厂厂长、创作人员、技术人员在会议期间展开了比先进、比干劲的社会主义竞赛。有的编剧人员表示准备在一年中写成两个剧本，有的导演表示要在一年内拍好两部以上的艺术片。各电影制片厂都制定了大跃进的增产节约指标。上海几个电影制片厂给会议打来电话说，这些厂决定把艺术片的成本从现在计划的十四万五千元再一次降低到十三万到十三万五千元。会议还收到了中央新闻纪录电影制片厂、北京电影制片厂、八一电影制片厂的职工们的许多贺信和决心书，这些电影厂的职工们表示有决心又多又好又快又省地完成今年大跃进的生产任务，并提出同兄弟厂展开友谊竞赛。
    文化部钱俊瑞副部长、夏衍副部长、电影事业管理局王阑西局长在会议期间向到会代表讲了话。钱俊瑞以“鼓足干劲，力争先进，比多比快，比好比省，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本，又红又专，为工农兵”这三十六个字勉励全国电影工作者以实际行动促进电影事业的大跃进。钱俊瑞还希望电影艺术工作人员在工作中坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，繁荣电影创作，进一步提高影片的思想性、艺术性，增加反映社会主义建设和工农兵现实生活的题材，同一切不健康的和错误的倾向作斗争。
