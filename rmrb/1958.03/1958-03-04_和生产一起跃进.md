    Leaping Forward Together with Production
    Jiang Dong
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site conference on financial and economic work in Macheng County to promote the experience of Macheng's great leap forward in financial and trade work, and boldly formulated ten measures for the province's great leap forward in financial and trade work. This meeting was well-held and timely.
    At present, both industrial and agricultural production across the country are experiencing a great leap forward, which requires cooperation and support from various aspects. Financial and economic departments are naturally no exception. To meet the requirements of all aspects, especially the great leap forward in agricultural production, financial and economic departments must break with convention and leap forward together with agricultural production. Otherwise, the increase in agricultural production may be damaged due to insufficient support.
    Can financial and economic work leap forward? The Tianqiao Department Store has already set an example; the fact that Macheng County's financial and trade work is leaping forward together with agricultural production once again provides a positive answer.
    What is the experience of the great leap forward in financial and trade work in Macheng County, and is it applicable to other regions? According to the summary of the Macheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, their main experience is that the county party committee has strengthened unified leadership over financial and economic work, strengthened political work, thereby enabling the vast number of financial and economic cadres to change their work style on the basis of improving their political awareness, delve into reality, connect with the masses, and establish a production viewpoint, so that the work has achieved great results. These experiences are applicable to all financial and economic departments.
    Now, the tide of the great leap forward in financial and economic work has already formed in Hubei Province. We believe that financial and economic departments across the country will carry forward the revolutionary spirit of working hard to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced, and in a short period of time, set off a climax of the leap forward in financial and economic work nationwide.

    和生产一起跃进
    江冬
    中共湖北省委在麻城县召开财经工作现场会议，推广麻城财贸工作大跃进的经验，并且大刀阔斧地制定了全省财贸工作大跃进的十大措施。这个会开得好、开得及时。
    目前全国工农业生产都在大跃进，这个跃进需要多方面的配合和支援。财经部门自然也不能例外。财经部门要满足各方面、特别是农业生产跃进的要求，就必须打破常规，和农业生产一起跃进。否则，农业增产就可能因支援不力而受到损害。
    财经工作能不能跃进？天桥百货商场已经作出榜样；麻城县财贸工作同农业生产一起跃进的事实又一次作了肯定的回答。
    麻城县财贸工作大跃进的经验是什么，它对其它地区是否适用？据中共麻城县委的总结，它们的主要经验是县委对财经工作加强了统一领导，加强了政治工作，从而能够使广大财经干部在提高政治觉悟的基础上改变作风，深入实际、联系群众，并且树立起生产观点，使工作取得了巨大的成绩。这些经验对于一切财经部门都是适用的。
    现在，财经工作大跃进的浪潮已经在湖北全省形成。我们相信全国各地财经部门一定会发扬比先进、学先进、赶先进的革命苦干精神，在短时期内，在全国范围掀起财经工作跃进的高潮。
