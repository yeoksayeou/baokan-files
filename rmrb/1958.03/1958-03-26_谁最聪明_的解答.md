    Answer to "Who is the Cleverest?"
    The colors of the stars on the three hats can only have the following distributions: 1. white-white-red; 2. white-red-red; 3. red-red-red.
    In the first case, the third child, knowing there are only two white stars, would immediately say that his hat has a red star without needing to think.
    In the second case, the second child (and the third child as well) would see that one sibling has a white star and another sibling has a red star, and should immediately say that his hat has a red star, because if he had a white star, the third sibling would immediately say that he has a red star.
    According to the fact that the children can only "answer after thinking for a while," the distribution of stars can only be the third type. In this case, each child needs to wait and see if others can say the color of their star. Therefore, all three children are wearing hats with red stars, and they have the same conditions when answering the question. Thus, the child who says he has a red star first is the cleverest.

    “谁最聪明”的解答
    三顶帽子上的星的颜色，只能有以下几种分配：1、白白红；2、白红红；3、红红红。
    如果是第一种情况，第三个孩子知道只有两颗白星，不需要考虑就会立刻说出他帽子上是红星。
    如果是第二种情况，第二个孩子（第三个也一样）看到一个兄弟是白星，而另一个兄弟是红星，就应当立刻说出他帽子上是红星，因为，如果他是白星，第三个兄弟立刻就会说出他自己是红星了。
    按照孩子们只有在“考虑了一会儿以后才能作出回答”，星的分配就只能是第三种。这样一来每个孩子都需要等待，看看旁人能否说出自己的星的颜色。可见三个孩子都戴了有红星的帽子，他们在解答问题时条件相同。因此首先说出他是红星的那个孩子，便是最聪明的。
