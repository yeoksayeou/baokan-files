Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 18th: The Soviet "Literary Gazette" recently published a dispatch exposing the extravagant dissipation of American capitalists and the extreme poverty of the working people.

The dispatch stated that in a corner of 18th Street and Park Street in New York, there is an unusual luxurious salon called "Dog Town." Wealthy people often talk about dogs here, bringing their dogs to have their teeth brushed, nails manicured, and fur groomed. The dog's mistress can buy anything for her four-legged darling here, from nylon pajamas worth twelve to thirty dollars to mink shawls costing as much as three hundred dollars. The bestsellers are rubber dinghies for dogs to ride in, raincoats, velvet Scottish bonnets, sportswear, nylon shirts, and fancy dress costumes.

Any style of furniture can also be bought in the dog salon. For example, the wife of an oil tycoon once bought a "Louis XV" style bed for her poodle. She thought that her dog should have a valuable bed to match the furniture in her private residence!

The dispatch continued: Just as the capitalists' favored dogs, wearing nylon clothes, are sleeping sweetly on mahogany beds, thousands upon thousands of unemployed people in American cities are standing in long queues outside the doors of charity providers, while others are lying on the floors of spit-stained inns.

The dispatch stated that the speed at which the number of unemployed Americans is growing can be illustrated by the following fact: In the week from February 9th to 16th this year alone, 425,300 people registered for relief. In front of a relief agency building in Chicago, there is often a long line waiting to receive bread. They stand in a line of four, enough to fill a whole street. According to the "Chicago Daily News," in this line, a 44-year-old unemployed mechanic from Pennsylvania told people that he had not eaten for twenty-eight hours. He had drifted to coffee shops to scrub floors, but even this meager job could not be sustained. He said, "I am a very good mechanic, but why have I fallen to this state?"

Not long ago, U.S. Vice President Nixon boasted that American society is full of "justice, moral laws, and the inviolability of human existence." The dispatch concluded by asking whether it is possible to derive his so-called "justice" and "moral laws" from this? (Attached picture)

### 人不如狗  四脚宠儿享福沙龙里  失业工人流落街头上

    人不如狗
    四脚宠儿享福沙龙里
    失业工人流落街头上
    新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联“文学报”最近刊登了一篇通讯，揭露美国资本家的奢侈无度和劳动人民极端贫困的生活实况。
    这篇通讯说，在纽约第十八号街和公园街的一个角落里，有一个名叫“狗镇”的不平常的豪华沙龙。富豪们常在这里大谈狗经，带着狗儿来这里刷牙、修指甲、修理毛发等。狗的女主人可在这里给她的四脚宠儿购买任何用品。从价值十二至三十美元的尼龙睡衣到贵达三百美元的水貉皮披肩，应有尽有。最畅销的是：供狗乘坐的橡皮小艇、雨衣、天鹅绒的苏格兰软帽、运动衣、尼龙衬衫和化装舞会的服装等。
    在狗沙龙里还可以买到任何式样的家具。例如，一个石油大王的妻子就曾在这里为她的鬈毛狗买了一张“卢多维克第十五”式卧床。她想，她的狗应该有一个名贵的卧床，才能和她私邸内的家具相称哩！
    这篇通讯继续写道：正当资本家所宠幸的，穿着尼龙衣的狗儿在红木卧床上甜蜜入睡的时候，在美国城市里却有成千上万的失业者排着长蛇似的行列站在施济者的门旁，有的则躺卧在渍满唾污的小客栈里的地板上。
    通讯说，美国失业人数增长的速度可从下列事实得到说明：今年2月9日至16日这一个星期内，登记要求救济者就达四十二万五千三百人。在芝加哥的一个救济机关的大楼前，常排着一个等候领取面包的长长的队伍。他们四人排成一列，也足足站满一条大街。据“芝加哥每日新闻”说，在这个行列中，一个从宾夕法尼亚来的失了业的四十四岁的机械师对人们说，他已经有二十八小时没有吃东西了，他曾流落到咖啡店干擦地板的活，然而连这个可怜的职业也保不住。他说：“我是一个很好的机械师，但为什么会沦落到这个地步？”
    不久以前，美国副总统尼克松还曾吹嘘美国社会充满着“正义、合乎道德的法律和人类生存的不可侵犯性”，通讯最后问道，从这里是否能得到他所说的所谓“正义”、“合乎道德的法律”的结论呢？（附图片）
