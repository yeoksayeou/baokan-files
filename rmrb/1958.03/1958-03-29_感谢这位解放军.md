    Thanks to This PLA Soldier
    On February 9th, all teachers and students of our Beijing Commercial Cadre School went to the Dashengzhuang Production Team in the Nanyuan District to participate in voluntary labor. The next day, at around 8:00 PM, one of the students suddenly fell ill. I accompanied him to the city to see a doctor. After walking more than eight li, we arrived at the bus station, only to find that the bus to Tongnan Xiaojie had already stopped running. Just as we were getting anxious, a car came from the south. I waved, and the car immediately stopped. The driver was a PLA soldier named Yuan Shifang. After hearing that we had a sick person who needed to go to the city for treatment, he let us get in. After the doctor's examination, the patient's condition turned out to be very serious. Fortunately, the treatment was timely, and his life was not in danger. I think that the PLA serves the people everywhere, and this small incident is proof of that.

    感谢这位解放军
    我们北京市商业干部学校全体师生，2月9日都到南苑区大生庄生产队参加义务劳动。第二天晚上八点多钟，有一个学员突然病倒。我陪送他进城看病。走了八里多路，到车站一看，通南小街的公共汽车没有了。正在着急的时候，正南来了一辆小汽车，我一招手，车马上停住。开汽车的是个解放军，名叫苑世方，听我说有病人要进城看病，就让我们上车。经过大夫检查，病人情况很是严重，幸好治疗及时，还没有生命危险。我想，解放军处处为人民，就是从这样一件小事也可以看出来。
