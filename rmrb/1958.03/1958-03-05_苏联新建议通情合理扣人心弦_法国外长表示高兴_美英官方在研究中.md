Xinhua News Agency Report: The Soviet Union's new proposal to convene a Foreign Ministers' conference to prepare for a summit meeting has caused strong repercussions in Western countries. French officials have expressed satisfaction with the Soviet government's agreement to hold a Foreign Ministers' conference to formulate the agenda and list of participants for the summit. Before leaving Paris for the Far East on the 1st, Foreign Minister Pineau said he was "very pleased" with the Soviet government's decision and expected the Foreign Ministers' conference to be held in May.

British Prime Minister Macmillan discussed the Soviet Union's new proposal for summit preparation with Foreign Secretary Lloyd on the 3rd. Lloyd also discussed the new Soviet proposal with NATO Secretary-General Spaak and the US Permanent Representative to NATO, Burgess.

A British Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain had "carefully studied" the Soviet proposal. However, he did not reveal Britain's attitude towards the proposal.

US President Eisenhower summoned Secretary of State Dulles on the 1st to discuss the Soviet proposal to hold a Foreign Ministers' conference to discuss the agenda and membership issues for a summit meeting. The State Department later issued a statement saying that the Soviet proposal was "being studied by the US government." However, under Eisenhower's instructions, the State Department has not yet commented on the Soviet proposal.

Meanwhile, according to US news agencies, US officials, who were "stunned" by the new Soviet proposal, are trying to downplay its significance and are preparing to put forward counter-proposals that would add obstacles and do not contribute to an early summit.

A West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Soviet proposal was "very interesting." However, officials have so far refused to formally state their position on the Soviet proposal.

Italian government officials welcomed the new Soviet proposal. According to Agence France-Presse, citing well-informed sources in Rome, Italy hopes to participate in any Foreign Ministers' conference held to arrange an East-West summit.

According to an announcement by NATO Headquarters in Paris on the evening of the 3rd, the NATO Council will hold a meeting on the 4th to discuss the new Soviet proposal. In addition, it is reported that the prospects for an East-West summit will also be a major topic on the agenda of the two-day meeting of the Western European Union's seven foreign ministers in Rome on the 5th.

According to some diplomatic sources in London, some people in the West are worried that the new Soviet proposal will become "enormous pressure," forcing the West to agree to hold a summit. They also revealed that these people intend to insist on linking the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe with the issue of German reunification, and linking the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing with broader disarmament issues, thereby hindering agreement on the summit agenda. There are reports that the United States is also attempting to minimize the scope of participation in the Foreign Ministers' conference and will also oppose the Soviet Union's proposal that the members of the East and West participating in the summit and Foreign Ministers' conference must be determined on an equal footing.

According to the British "Scotsman", Britain and the United States disagree on the date of holding a summit. Britain has the idea of holding a summit "between June and July," while the United States believes that even preparatory talks at the "ministerial or ambassadorial level" will be delayed until June or July, let alone a summit.

British, French, and West German newspapers have paid great attention to the new Soviet proposal, with many newspapers expressing welcome and believing that the West has no reason to reject it.

    苏联新建议通情合理扣人心弦
    法国外长表示高兴　美英官方在研究中
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联关于召开外长会议来准备政府首脑会议的新建议，在西方国家中引起强烈的震动。法国官方人士对于苏联政府同意举行外长会议来拟定最高级会议的议程和参加者的名单一事，表示满意。外交部长比诺1日在离开巴黎赴远东以前说，他对苏联政府的这个决定感到“非常高兴”，并且预料外长会议可能在5月举行。
    英国首相麦克米伦3日同外交大臣劳埃德讨论了苏联关于最高级会议准备工作的新建议。劳埃德还同北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克以及美国驻北大西洋集团的常任代表伯吉斯讨论了苏联的新建议。
    英国外交部发言人说，英国已经“仔细研究了”苏联的建议。但是他没有透露英国对这个建议采取什么态度。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔1日召见了国务卿杜勒斯，商讨苏联提出的关于举行外长会议来讨论最高级会议的议程和成员问题的建议。国务院后来发表声明说，苏联这个建议“正由美国政府研究中”。但是在艾森豪威尔的指示下，国务院至今一直没有对苏联的建议发表评论。
    同时，据美国通讯社透露，给苏联的新建议“吓呆了”的美国官方正在设法贬低苏联建议的意义，并且准备提出一些增加障碍和无助于早日召开最高级会议的反建议。
    西德外交部一位发言人表示，苏联这个建议“很有意思”。但是官方迄今为止拒绝对苏联的这个建议正式表明态度。
    意大利政府人士对苏联的新建议表示欢迎。据法新社引罗马消息灵通人士的话说，意大利希望能参加为安排东西方最高级会议而举行的任何外长会议。
    据北大西洋总部3日晚上在巴黎宣布，北大西洋集团理事会将在4日举行会议，讨论苏联的新建议。另外，有消息说，关于东西方最高级会议的前景问题也将是5日在罗马召开的西欧联盟七国外交部是会议两天会议上的主要议题。
    据在伦敦的一些外交界人士透露，西方某些人士担心苏联的新建议成为“巨大的压力”，迫使西方同意举行最高级会议。他们还透露，这些人打算坚持把在欧洲建立无原子武器区的问题同德国统一问题联系起来，并且把停止核武器试验的问题同更广泛的裁军问题联系起来，从而阻挠在最高级会议议程方面达成协议。有消息说，美国还企图尽量缩小外长会议参加国的范围，并且还将反对苏联提出的关于东西方参加最高级会议和外长会议的成员必须在对等的基础上确定这一个意见。
    另据英国“苏格兰人报”透露，英国和美国在举行最高级会议的日期问题上意见分歧。英国有在“六月或七月间”举行最高级会议的想法，而美国则认为即使是“部长会议或大使级”的准备性会谈也要拖到六、七月间才开始，更谈不上最高级会议了。
    英国、法国、西德报纸都很重视苏联新建议，许多报纸表示欢迎，认为西方再没有理由加以拒绝。
