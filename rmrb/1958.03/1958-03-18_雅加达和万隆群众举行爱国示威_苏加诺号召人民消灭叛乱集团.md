    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 16th - 500,000 people in Jakarta held a demonstration and march on the afternoon of the 16th, opposing the Hussein rebel group and condemning the interference of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other foreign countries.
    The people, in high spirits, first gathered at Banteng Square. Under the chairmanship of Lieutenant Colonel Dahyar, Jakarta Garrison Commander and Chairman of the Jakarta National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, a resolution was passed. The resolution accused the conspiracies of rebels such as Hussein and Sjafruddin of obstructing the people's struggle to liberate West Irian and of being supported by foreign countries. The resolution stated that the people of Jakarta "condemn the open or secret interference of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other foreign countries, and demand that the government implement general mobilization to suppress the rebellion and resolutely repel foreign interference." The resolution also expressed "support for the Juanda government, which is leading the Indonesian people in a national struggle to liberate West Irian, suppress the Hussein rebel group, and thoroughly liquidate foreign capital in Indonesia."
    After the meeting, people marched from Banteng Square. The marching masses shouted slogans and held up placards. When the marching procession passed the Presidential Palace, it was reviewed by President Sukarno. The marching crowds then gathered in front of the Presidential Palace, and Lieutenant Colonel Dahyar and Jakarta Mayor Sudiro, on behalf of the people, handed the resolution to President Sukarno.
    Sukarno delivered a speech to the crowd. He praised the patriotic actions of the people of Jakarta. Sukarno said that all forces should be mobilized to eliminate the rebel group. The government and the army have taken resolute measures. The President called on people to participate in the action.
    On the morning of the 16th, a mass rally was also held in Bandung. The scale of this rally was even larger than that in Jakarta. President Sukarno addressed the rally. He said that according to the information he obtained during his visit abroad, it proved that there were indeed foreign adventurers using Indonesian rebels, because these foreign adventurers did not like Indonesia maintaining its non-alignment and hoped that Indonesia would join a certain bloc. The President called on all Indonesian people and all political parties to unite, support the government, fight, overcome difficulties, defeat the rebel group, and liberate West Irian.

    雅加达和万隆群众举行爱国示威
    苏加诺号召人民消灭叛乱集团
    据新华社雅加达16日电　雅加达五十万人在16日下午举行示威游行，反对侯赛尼叛乱集团，并且谴责东南亚条约组织和其他外国的干涉。
    情绪激昂的人们首先在雄牛广场集会。在雅加达警备司令、雅加达争取解放西伊里安民族阵线主席达赫亚尔中校主持下，通过了一项决议。决议指责侯赛尼、沙弗鲁丁等叛乱分子的阴谋是阻挠人民解放西伊里安的斗争，并且是得到外国的支持的。决议说，雅加达人民“谴责东南亚条约组织和其他外国的公开或秘密的干涉，并且要求政府实行总动员来镇压叛乱，全力击退外国干涉”。决议还表示“支持朱安达政府，它正在领导印度尼西亚人民进行全民斗争、解放西伊里安、镇压侯赛尼反叛集团、彻底清算在印度尼西亚的外国资本。”
    会后，人们从雄牛广场出发，举行游行。游行群众喊着口号，高举着标语牌。游行行列经过总统府时受到了苏加诺总统的检阅。接着游行群众就聚集在总统府门前，由达赫亚尔中校和雅加达市长苏迪罗代表人民把决议交给苏加诺总统。
    苏加诺向人群发表演说。他赞扬雅加达人民的爱国行动。苏加诺说，应当动员一切力量来消灭叛乱集团。政府和军队已经采取了坚决的措施。总统号召人们参加行动。
    16日上午，在万隆也举行了群众大会。这个大会的规模甚至比雅加达的还大。苏加诺总统向大会发表演说。他说，根据他在外国访问时所获得的材料，证明的确有外国冒险家在利用印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，因为这些外国冒险家不喜欢印度尼西亚保持不参加任何集团，而希望印度尼西亚参加某一个集团。总统号召印度尼西亚全体人民和所有政党团结一致，支持政府，进行斗争，克服困难，击溃反叛集团，解放西伊里安。
