Baoding, This newspaper, March 30th. A mass agricultural implement revolution has universally blossomed in the rural areas of Hebei Province. From the very beginning, this revolution has demonstrated the tremendous power of promoting productivity.

According to incomplete statistics, along with the great leap in production, farmers in Hebei Province have reformed and created more than a hundred kinds of agricultural implements. Among them are four-legged seeders, water seeders, and rice seedling planters for sowing; rice borer removers for pest control; ball bearing pulleys and soil hoists for construction projects; bicycle waterwheels, hydraulic automatic waterwheels, and horse-drawn water pumps for irrigation; and automatic water mills for processing, and more than ten other types. Now, in counties and townships where the old agricultural implement reform movement is developing well, everyone is improving agricultural implements, and every commune has mechanical craftsmen. In three counties including Jiahe and Wuqiao, more than 1,200 agricultural cooperatives have established research and production organizations for agricultural implement improvement. In four counties, including Renqiu and Wuqiang, there are more than 7,000 local experts and craftsmen engaged in agricultural implement reform in agricultural cooperatives. A vast technical force has been formed.

The facts of agricultural implement reform prove that even a small reform can exert the power to promote production. According to the investigation, simply installing a set of ball bearings on the pulley can increase efficiency by one and a half times. Changing a two-legged seeder to a four-legged seeder can double labor efficiency. The Beigaoqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Xushui County used bicycle gears and chains to drive a five-wheeled waterwheel, which increased efficiency by two times and also saved animal power. Many improved agricultural implements with greater efficiency in Hebei Province are no less effective than power machinery. The bellows-type water pump and hydraulic automatic waterwheel created by the Doucun Township in Wuqiang County and the Langzhongzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County can irrigate 30 mu of farmland every day, and the irrigation efficiency is equivalent to that of a medium-sized portable boiler.

The mass agricultural implement revolution has helped many agricultural cooperatives overcome the contradictions between the current heavy production and construction tasks and the shortage of labor and animal power, and has to a certain extent made up for the shortage of agricultural machinery. The Guzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Shenze County could not buy power water-lifting machinery after drilling a well. The members used the principle of a horse-drawn cotton gin to make a water pump powered machine. Two livestock were used to drive the water pump, which was equivalent to the water output of a five-horsepower portable boiler, and the cost was low, thus solving the difficulty of insufficient power machinery. The mass agricultural implement revolution has also enlightened the masses' wisdom. After imitating and using three improved agricultural implements such as automatic booms, the Jianming Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County also researched and designed several improved agricultural implements such as climbing fences and automatic soil loosening harrows. Many members have learned to use ball bearings, levers, pulleys, wheel axles, winches, air pressure, and wind and water power in the improvement of agricultural implements, creating conditions for the large-scale use of agricultural machinery.

    河北农具改革技术队伍强大
    任丘武强四县就有行家七千多人
    本报保定30日讯　一个群众性的农具革命，已在河北省农村普遍开花。这个革命一开始，就显示了促进生产力的巨大力量。
    据不完全的统计，伴随着生产大跃进，河北省农民改革和创造的农具已有百余种。其中有播种用的四腿耧、水耧、水稻点种器；除虫用的稻苞除虫器；建筑工程用的滚珠滑车、土吊斗；灌溉用的自行车水车、水力自动水车和马拉水泵；加工用的自动水碾子等十多种类型。现在，旧农具改革运动开展较好的县、乡，已作到大家动手改良农具，社社都有机械匠。交河、吴桥等三县，已有一千二百多个农业社建立了农具改良的研究生产组织。任丘、武强等四县，农业社从事农具改革的土专家、工匠共达七千余人。已形成一支庞大的技术力量。
    农具改革事实证明，那怕是一点微小的改革，也能发挥促进生产的威力。据调查，滑车上只装一副滚珠轴承，便能提高效率一倍半。两腿耧改成四腿耧，劳动效率就能提高一倍。徐水县北高桥农业社用自行车的齿轮和练条带动五轮水车，效率提高了两倍，还节省了畜力。河北省许多效率较大的改良农具，功效还不亚于动力机器。武强县豆村乡与遵化县郎仲庄农业社创造的风箱式抽水机和水力自动水车，每天都能汲水灌溉农田三十亩，灌溉效能相当一台中型的锅驼机。
    群众性的农具革命，帮助许多农业社克服了当前生产建设任务繁重和劳畜力不足的矛盾，并在一定程度上弥补了农业机械的不足。深泽县孤庄农业社打了机井买不到动力提水机械，社员们以马拉弹花弓的原理，制成一部水泵马力机具，用两个牲口拉着带动水泵，相当一台五马力锅驼机的抽水量，而且造价便宜，动力机械不足的困难也解决了。群众性的农具革命还启发了群众的智慧。遵化县建明农业社仿制使用了自动吊杆等三种改良农具后，又研究设计了爬篱，自动松土耙等几种改良农具。许多社员在改良农具当中，已经学会运用滚珠、杠杆、滑轮、轮轴、绞车、空气压力和风水的动力，给农业机械的大量使用创造了条件。　　（张华）
