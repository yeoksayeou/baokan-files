    The Important Key to Running Enterprises Well
    Wen Ying
    Whether a factory enterprise is run well is closely related to the leadership style of the enterprise. The process of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory director and Party committee secretary changing the poor quality of the factory's products and successfully trial-producing a large number of new products, as published in this newspaper today, vividly and powerfully illustrates that the transformation of enterprise leaders' work style directly affects the transformation of the enterprise.
    The issue of leadership style is primarily the issue of the relationship between leading cadres and the masses. Under the socialist system, the class interests of leading cadres and workers are consistent, which is completely different from the labor-capital relationship under the capitalist system. Therefore, enterprise leading cadres must be good at uniting the workers and masses to improve production. If leading cadres see themselves as special, are bureaucratic, and domineering, causing workers to avoid them from afar, and if the relationship with the workers and masses is not good, not only will production not improve, but it will also suppress the enthusiasm of the masses and become an obstacle to the development of production. To solve the product quality problem, the leading cadres of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory initially adopted the method of supervising workers, dividing their forces to guard key points, being bureaucratic, and "rectifying" the workers every day, which made the workers dispirited and lose confidence. The number of substandard cloths produced increased daily, and the relationship between the leading cadres and the workers and masses became increasingly tense. When the higher authorities severely cracked down on this bureaucracy, and the leading personnel contaminated by bureaucracy thoroughly changed their work style, the relationship between cadres and the masses quickly changed, and the enterprise's production outlook took on a completely new look.
    Adhering to and implementing the mass line is the key to running all undertakings well. A leader who truly follows the mass line must not only have the desire to serve the people, closely connect with the masses, rely on the masses, and consult with the masses on everything, but also be good at concentrating the experiences of the masses, summarizing and improving them, and then implementing them among the masses, correctly adopting the method of "from the masses, to the masses." Only in this way can we concentrate the wisdom of the masses, solve the problems that arise in our work, and do our work well. Enterprise management personnel have the responsibility of management for the enterprise; however, in front of the workers and masses, they are just ordinary laborers. They should regard the difficulties encountered by the workers in production as their own difficulties, listen to the workers' opinions in a timely manner, explore the laws of production of the enterprise together with the workers, and discuss ways to improve production, thereby enhancing the enthusiasm and confidence of the workers and masses and improving the enterprise's production level.
    Our Party and government's work has always emphasized following the mass line. Today, in factories and enterprises, some leading personnel are adopting the leadership method of cultivating "experimental plots," studying technology together with the workers and masses, discovering advanced technologies and advanced experiences, and promoting them. This is a new and effective method. The scale of production in our country is developing day by day, and production technology also needs to be innovated step by step. The old set of management methods can no longer adapt to the development of the situation. We hope that the leading cadres of all enterprises will quickly take up this new weapon of cultivating "experimental plots," go deep into the masses, humbly learn production technology from them, and strive to transform from laymen to experts as soon as possible, and become cadres who are both red and expert as soon as possible.

### 办好企业的重要关键

    办好企业的重要关键
    文英
    工厂企业办得好不好，和企业的领导作风有着十分密切的关系。今天本报发表的云南漂染厂厂长和党委书记改变工厂产品质量的低劣状况，试制成功大批新产品的过程，生动有力地说明了企业领导干部作风的转变，直接影响到企业的转变。
    领导作风问题，主要是领导干部和群众的关系问题。在社会主义制度下，领导干部和工人的阶级利益是一致的，这和资本主义制度下的劳资关系是截然不同。因此，企业领导干部必须善于团结工人群众来搞好生产。如果领导干部自视特殊，官气十足，盛气凌人，叫工人见了就远远地躲开，和工人群众的关系搞不好，不仅不能搞好生产，反而会压制群众的积极性，成为发展生产的障碍。云南漂染厂的领导干部为了解决产品质量问题，起先采用监督工人的方法，分兵把口、官气十足，天天“整”工人，弄得工人垂头丧气，丧失信心，生产的次布逐日增多，而领导干部同工人群众之间的关系也就越来越紧张。当上级对于这种官气给予狠狠地打击，沾染官气的领导人员痛改作风以后，干部和群众的关系很快就有了改变，企业生产面貌就焕然一新。
    坚持执行群众路线，是办好一切事业的关键。真正走群众路线的领导者，不仅要有为人民服务的愿望，密切联系群众，依靠群众，遇事和群众商量，而且还要善于集中群众的经验，加以总结和提高，再贯彻到群众中去，正确地采取“从群众中来到群众中去”的方法。这样才能集中群众的智慧，解决工作中发生的问题，做好工作。企业管理人员对企业来说负有管理的责任，然而，他在工人群众面前，只是一个普通的劳动者，对工人们在生产中遇到的困难，应当看做自己的困难，及时地听取工人的意见，和工人一道摸索本企业生产的规律，商量改进生产的办法，从而提高工人群众的积极性和信心，使企业生产水平得以提高。
    我们的党和政府的一切工作，从来都是强调走群众路线的。今天，在工厂企业中，一些领导人员采用种试验田的领导方法，同工人群众一起研究技术，发现先进技术和先进经验，加以推广，这是一个新的行之有效方法。我们国家的生产规模一天天在发展，生产技术也需要一步步革新，旧的一套管理方法已经不能适应形势的发展了。我们希望一切企业的领导干部赶快把种“试验田”这个新的武器拿起来，深入到群众中去，虚心地向他们学习生产技术，争取尽快地从外行变成为内行，尽快地变为又红又专的干部。
