    What are they doing?
    The Shixian and Kaishantun paper mills, which are more than a hundred miles apart, often send people to each other to learn and exchange experiences. This photo shows that after the Shixian Paper Mill created a record of three hours and forty-eight minutes in unbleached wood pulp cooking time, the factory leaders proactively told the Kaishantun Paper Mill about the experience and the specific technical measures taken by telephone, and wished them to create a higher record.

    他们在做什么？
    相隔百余里的石岘和开山屯两个造纸厂经常派人到对方学习和交流经验。这是石岘造纸厂在本色木浆蒸煮时间上创造三小时四十八分的纪录后，工厂领导干部主动把经验和采取的具体技术措施用电话告诉开山屯造纸厂，并且预祝他们创造更高的纪录。
