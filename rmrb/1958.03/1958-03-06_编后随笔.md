    Editor's Notes
    Combining Top-Down and Bottom-Up

    Suzhou's practice of submitting its local industrial development plan to the entire population for discussion is commendable.

    A plan is a program of action for the masses. If the plan is too low, it cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses; if it is too high, it cannot be achieved, and it will also dampen the enthusiasm of the masses. To formulate an advanced and reliable leap forward plan, the best way is to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches.

    The masses are the most powerful promoters. Submitting the plan to the masses for discussion can make it more advanced and more practical. Anything, as long as the masses agree, no matter how great the difficulty, it can be accomplished.

    Early Action is Strength

    Uneven construction is a chronic headache for basic construction departments every year. It causes workers to be idle at times and rush to work at others; it causes management cadres to be busy and passive; and the result is waste for the country.

    This year, all fronts are making a comprehensive leap forward, and construction departments should also make a leap forward in terms of seasonal balance. The construction units in Tianjin have broken the convention that "construction cannot start until the ground thaws" and started work half a month early. It is hoped that other units will catch up quickly, and that design departments will step up their support. "The first year depends on the first season," early action is strength.

    编后随笔
    上下结合
    苏州市把发展地方工业的规划交给全民讨论，这种做法值得提倡。
    规划是群众的行动纲领。规划太低了，不能动员群众的积极性；太高了，实现不了，也会挫伤群众的积极性。而要制定一个既先进又可靠的跃进规划，最好的办法就是自上而下和自下而上相结合。
    群众是最有力的促进派。把规划交给群众讨论，就可以订得更先进，更切合实际。任何事情，只要群众点了头，任你有多大困难，也一定能办成。
    早下手为强
    施工不均衡，是基本建设部门年年头痛的老问题了。它害得工人时而窝工，时而赶工；害得管理干部忙乱被动；结局是给国家造成了浪费。
    今年各条战线全面跃进，施工部门在季节的均衡性方面也应当跃进。天津市的建筑单位打破了“地不开冻不能动工”的惯例，提前半月开了工。希望别的单位急起直追，希望设计部门加紧支援。“头年看头季”，还是早下手为强。
