Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, called on all national art colleges at the National Art College Principals' Conference on February 26 to resolutely implement the policy of combining teaching with labor production, and to save some or most of the expenses within two or three years. Schools with conditions should strive for self-sufficiency. Qian Junrui said that there is a great waste of financial and material resources in art schools, and the biggest waste is the waste of "people." Because the teaching content and methods are divorced from reality and the masses, the cadres trained cannot fully adapt to socialist construction and the needs of the people. Qian Junrui pointed out that the roots of conservative ideas and extravagance in art education are: bourgeois individual fame and profit thoughts; bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts—divorced from the masses, divorced from politics, and not serving workers, peasants, and soldiers; bureaucracy and metaphysical ideological methods—one-sidedness and fixation.

Qian Junrui said that resolutely implementing the policy of combining teaching with production will bring about a fundamental reform in China's art education, making our art education basically able to adapt to the needs of socialist construction and the people, and truly solve the so-called problem of "incompatible calibers" that has not been completely resolved for a long time; thereby combining politics and business, theory and practice, physical labor and mental labor, and intellectuals and workers and peasants; at the same time, the correct combination of popularization and improvement of art can be better resolved. The result of labor production combined with professional work in art schools is popularization work, and it is also popularization under the guidance of improvement, thus clarifying the direction of improvement. Implementing this policy can also better combine inheriting national traditions and learning from foreign experience in practice. After implementing work-study programs and part-work, part-study programs, it can also save a lot of funds for the country in order to develop production.

Regarding the measures to implement this policy, Qian Junrui proposed to implement "three diligences" and "three releases," that is, to run schools diligently and frugally, to produce diligently and frugally, and to implement work-study programs diligently; to go down to factories and rural areas for labor training, to open the school gates, and to cooperate with relevant parties to develop production; cadres should go down to the departments and classes of the school to participate in teaching and production.

    教学同劳动生产结合
    将使艺术教育根本改观
    据新华社2日讯　文化部副部长钱俊瑞2月26日在全国艺术院校长会议上，号召全国艺术院校坚决贯彻教学与劳动生产相结合的方针，在二三年内作到节省经费的一部分或者大部分，有条件的学校应当努力争取自给。钱俊瑞说，艺术学校中财力物力的浪费很大，而最大的浪费是“人”的浪费，由于教学内容和方法脱离实际、脱离群众，使培养出来的干部不能完全适应社会主义建设和人民群众的需要。钱俊瑞指出，形成艺术教育工作中的保守思想和铺张浪费的根源是：资产阶级个人名利思想；资产阶级的文艺思想——脱离群众、脱离政治，不为工农兵服务；官僚主义以及形而上学的思想方法——片面化、固定化。
    钱俊瑞说，坚决贯彻教学与生产相结合的方针，将会使我国艺术教育发生一个带根本性的改革，将使我们的艺术教育基本上能够适应社会主义建设和人民群众的需要，真正解决长期以来没有完全解决的所谓“口径不合”的问题；从而使政治与业务结合、理论与实际结合、体力劳动与脑力劳动结合、知识分子与工农结合；同时可以更好地解决艺术的普及和提高正确结合的问题。在艺术学校中实行与专业结合的劳动生产的成果就是普及工作，同时又是在提高指导下的普及，从而也就明确了提高的方向。贯彻这个方针也可以使继承民族传统与学习外国经验在实践中更好地结合起来。实行勤工俭学、半工半读后，还可以为国家节省大量资金，以便发展生产。
    关于贯彻这个方针的措施，钱俊瑞提出，要实行“三勤”、“三放”，就是说要勤俭办学、勤俭生产、勤工俭学；下放到工厂、农村进行劳动锻炼，开放学校大门，和有关方面协作发展生产；干部下放到学校的系、班去参加教学、生产。
