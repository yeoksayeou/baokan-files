    Every Township Has Innovation, Every Commune Has Reform:
    Dali County Farmers' Tool Reform Sweeps the Land

    (By our reporters Yi Xiao and Han Guoying) Farmers in Dali County, Shaanxi Province are independently improving old farm tools and creating new ones on a massive scale. Now, almost every township in the county has innovation, and every commune has reform, with new tools for every type of farm work. Thirteen of the county's seventeen townships have already made creative inventions. The types of farm tools created and improved by farmers are numerous, with five types of greater value for promotion being used in farmland water conservancy construction and land leveling; fourteen types for water lifting; eleven types for sowing; four types for cultivating and fertilizing; and six types for processing agricultural products. In addition, there are several types used for land preparation, seedling setting, applying pesticides, planting trees, and transportation.

    The promotion of new-style farm tools has given farmers great inspiration in improving their tools. As early as the autumn of 1956, the county distributed a twelve-row drill seeder to the Lichao Agricultural Cooperative. All fourteen production teams vied for it, so the Party branch proposed that the cooperative's carpentry team imitate it. After research, the carpentry team designed and successfully trial-produced a six-row drill seeder based on the principles of the twelve-row machine. The iron twelve-row drill seeder required two large animals and two people, and could sow sixty mu per day; while this wooden six-row drill seeder required only one animal and one person, and could sow thirty-five mu per day, with the same good sowing quality. Moreover, because it was made of wood, the cost was only one-twentieth of the iron one. They quickly produced thirteen more. Each team had one, and all wheat sowing was mechanized that year. The 5,500 mu of wheat fields were all sown in just three days, shortening the time by three days compared to the previous year.

    The characteristics of these farmer-made machines are that they use local materials, are simple to manufacture, convenient to use, and easy to promote. The vast majority of these dozens of farm tools are made of wood, with very low costs. The cost of a wooden cotton double-row drill seeder is less than one-third of that of an iron one, and manufacturing is also very easy. Usually, when a new tool appears in one commune, another commune sends people to see it, or asks for a blueprint, and then they can make it themselves.

    The Dali County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to farmers' automatic innovation of farm tools. They have now relatively widely promoted farm tools of general significance throughout the county, and have included the promotion of farmer-made farm tools as an important measure to solve the shortage of labor and animal power in this year's plan.

### 乡乡有创造　社社有改革  大荔县农民改革工具风起云涌

    乡乡有创造　社社有改革
    大荔县农民改革工具风起云涌
    本报讯记者伊晓、韩国英报道：陕西省大荔县农民自己动手大量地改良旧农具，创造新农具。现在，这个县几乎乡乡有创造、社社有改良，样样活路有新工具。全县十七个乡已经有创造发明的就有十三个乡。农民创造改良的农具种类繁多，推广价值较大的有用于农田水利建设和土地平整的五种；汲水的十四种；播种的十一种；中耕、施肥的四种；农产品加工的六种。此外，尚有用于整地、定苗、施农药、植树和运输的若干种。
    新式农具的推广给了农民在改良农具上以很大启发。还在1956年秋初，县上发了一架十二行条播机给荔潮农业社，十四个生产队都争着要，党支部就提议由社内木工组仿制。木工组研究后，依照十二行机的原理，自己设计并试制成功一架六行条播机。铁制十二行条播机用两头大牲口两个人，一天能播六十亩；而这种木制六行条播机只用一头牲口一个人，一天能播三十五亩，播种质量同样良好。而且因为是木料制成，成本只相当于铁制的二十分之一。他们很快又赶制出了十三部。一队一部，当年种麦就全部土机械化了。五千五百亩麦田只三天就全部种妥，比前一年缩短了三天时间。
    这些农民自制机具的特点是就地取材，制造简单，使用方便，便于推广。这几十种农具绝大部分都是木制的，成本很低。一架木制棉花双行条播机的造价还不到铁制的三分之一，制造也很容易，通常是这个社出现了一个新东西，那个社派人来看，或者要个图样，就可制造出来。
    中共大荔县委对于农民自动革新农具相当重视。他们现在已经较普遍的推广了在全县有普遍意义的农具，并且把推广农民自造的农具作为解决劳畜力不足的一项重要措施列入今年规划。
