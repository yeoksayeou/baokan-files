Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 12th: The Xining XinSheng First Brick and Tile Factory has successfully trial-produced two types of cement using simple methods. These two types of cement can be used in water conservancy construction and industrial construction.

Qinghai Province has abundant raw materials such as limestone, clay, gypsum, and iron ore. Based on this characteristic, the factory has actively carried out the trial production of No. 200-400 silicate cement this year. They mixed limestone, clay, iron ore and other raw materials in proportion, put them in a baking furnace for calcination, increased the temperature to between 1200 and 1300 degrees, and after about an hour, the mixture became a gray-green crystalline clinker. Then, gypsum was added, crushed, and sieved through a 160-mesh sieve to become cement. After chemical analysis, this cement meets the standards for silicate cement composition. The cost of this cement is only about 40 yuan per ton.

The factory is also using hydrated lime, gypsum, clay and other raw materials to trial-produce No. 250-1150 lime-sintered clay cement. The manufacturing method of this cement is even simpler, only requiring the mixing of several raw materials in proportion, waiting for a certain amount of time, pulverizing and sieving. The bottom ash of the lime kiln, and broken bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factory are all readily available clinker that does not require calcination. The cost of this cement is about 27 yuan per ton.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th: Not long ago, the Fengjie Sulfur Factory in Wanxian Special District, Sichuan Province, successfully trial-produced ammonium sulfate using sulfur residue. Relevant departments in Sichuan Province are promoting this experience of producing chemical fertilizers using indigenous methods throughout the province and beyond.

The ammonium sulfate produced by the Fengjie Sulfur Factory is of good quality, with a purity of 96.8% and a nitrogen content of about 20% (generally, commercial ammonium sulfate has a nitrogen content of 20.5%). The manufacturing cost is only three cents per pound. The method of producing fertilizer is very simple. First, immerse the sulfur residue in cold water, stir to clarify, filter, then seep the solution into a lead pot, heat and evaporate it into a paste, cool it, and then put it in a drying room to dry, and it becomes commercial ammonium sulfate. This "immersion-extraction and concentration method" is entirely manual. Only a few wooden barrels, a few lead pots, and some simple equipment are needed to extract 35 pounds of ammonium sulfate from 100 pounds of sulfur residue.

After the news of the successful production of ammonium sulfate by the Fengjie Sulfur Factory using indigenous methods spread, people came to the factory to learn almost every day, and many also wrote letters and telegrams requesting an introduction to their experience. As of the 3rd of this month, nearly a hundred people had been sent to learn from Henan, Hubei, Guizhou and other provinces and nine special districts in Sichuan Province alone.

The relevant leading departments in Sichuan Province attach great importance to spreading this experience. A working group composed of engineers, technicians and cadres from the County Industry Section dispatched by the Chemical Bureau of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry and the Wanxian Special District Industry Bureau has been stationed at the Sulfur Factory to receive people who come to study and help them learn the technology. In order to enable this experience to quickly blossom and bear fruit throughout the country, they organized visitors to adopt a flowing learning method, teaching one batch after another, enabling them to master the method before they leave; teaching one person at a time, enabling them to master the method before they leave. The County Industry Section also reprinted more complete technical information and distributed it to various places outside the province for reference.

    不依赖大城市　不等待建新厂
    土办法制水泥造化肥又快又省
    西宁、奉节因地制宜生产急需的物资
    本报特约新华社西宁12日电　西宁新生第一砖瓦厂用简易方法试制两种水泥，初步成功。这两种水泥在兴修水利、工业建设等方面都能使用。
    青海省有丰富的石灰石、粘土、石膏、铁矿石等原料。这个厂根据这一特点，今年积极进行了二○○号——四○○号矽酸盐水泥的试制工作。他们把石灰石、粘土、铁矿石等原料按比例配成后，放在烘炉上锻烧，温度加到一千二百度到一千三百度之间，经过一小时左右，这块混合物就成了灰绿色结晶状的熟料块。然后加上石膏，砸碎，用一六○号的筛子筛过就成了水泥。经过化验分析，这种水泥合乎矽酸盐水泥成分的标准。这种水泥的成本，每吨只四十元左右。
    这个厂还正在利用熟石灰、石膏、粘土等原料，试制二五一一五○号石灰烧结粘土水泥。这种水泥的制造方法更简单，只需要把几种原料按比例配合在一起，经过一定时间，粉碎后用筛子筛过即成。石灰窑的窑炉底灰、砖瓦厂的破砖、碎瓦都是不需要锻烧的现成熟料。这种水泥每吨成本约二十七元。
    本报特约新华社成都12日电　四川省万县专区奉节硫磺厂不久以前利用硫磺脚渣试制硫酸铵成功。四川有关部门正在向省内外推广这一用土法生产化学肥料的经验。
    奉节硫磺厂制成的硫酸铵质量良好，纯度达96.8％，含氮量为20％左右（一般商品硫酸铵含氮量为20.5％）。每斤制造成本只要三分钱。生产肥料的方法非常简便。先将硫磺脚渣浸入冷水里，搅拌澄清过滤以后，再将溶液渗入铅锅内，加热蒸发成糊状，冷却之后放进烘干房里烘干，便成商品硫酸铵。这种“浸取浓缩法”全由手工操作，只需要购置几个木桶，几口铅锅和一些简单的设备，就可以从一百斤硫磺脚渣中提取三十五斤硫酸铵。
    奉节硫磺厂用土法制造硫酸铵成功的消息传开以后，几乎每天都有人来厂学习，写信、打电报来要求介绍经验的也很多。截至本月3日，仅河南、湖北、贵州等省和四川省九个专区派来学习的就有近百人。
    四川省各有关领导部门十分重视传播这一经验。由四川省工业厅化工局、万县专区工业局派出的工程师、技术员和县工业科的干部组成的工作组，一直在硫磺厂负责接待前来学习的人，帮助他们学习技术。为了使这一经验迅速在全国各地开花结果，他们组织来参观的人采取流水学习的办法，来一批教一批，会一批走一批；来一个教一个，会一个走一个。县工业科还翻印了比较完整的技术资料，发给省外各地参考。
