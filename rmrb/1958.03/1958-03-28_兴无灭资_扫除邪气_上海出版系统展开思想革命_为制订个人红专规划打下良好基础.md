Promote Proletarian Ideology and Eliminate Bourgeois Ideology, Sweep Away Evil Influences
Shanghai Publishing System Launches Ideological Revolution, Laying a Good Foundation for Formulating Individual Red and Expert Plans

(Our Newspaper, Reporter Ji Yin) The twenty-plus units of the Shanghai publishing system recently launched an ideological exchange in the "Double-Anti" movement, a climax of sweeping away "six airs," making the "Double-Anti" movement a truly profound ideological revolution. Now, in these units, criticism and self-criticism big-character posters are numbering in the thousands, and all kinds of bourgeois erroneous thoughts and "six airs" have been exposed and criticized by the masses. People ask each other when they meet: "How many big-character posters have you received?" If the answer is only a dozen or so, the other party will say "Too few, too few." If the answer is "I have received one or two hundred," people congratulate each other "Harvest, harvest."

The reporter recently visited the Children's Publishing House, where the sweeping away of "six airs" movement is in full swing. The leading cadres of the society implemented the method of igniting fire on themselves, writing big-character posters to expose and criticize themselves, and also making suggestions to others. As a result, the masses put forward a large number of criticisms to the leading cadres. The four main responsible cadres received more than 1,100 big-character posters. In the high tide of ideological criticism, the enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedentedly high, and many people spoke their minds in big-character posters. One staff member named Zhao, who had always been indifferent to politics and taciturn, was called a "political mute" by the people. This time, he also wrote nearly 200 big-character posters, 57 of which were self-criticism. A couple also posted big-character posters to each other for criticism. In these criticisms, people exposed the naked "money worship" in the pursuit of manuscript fees. For example, four staff members of this society took a total of 2,303 days of "sick leave" in three years, created 42 children's works, received wages as usual, and earned more than 16,900 yuan in royalties. One staff member drew a cartoon criticizing himself as "lazy as a cat during the day, and ferocious as a tiger at night" (that is, lacking energy in work during the day and creating at home at night). A big-character poster criticized a leading cadre for treating work (reading manuscripts) as "full of individualistic vigor, lacking socialist vigor," and another leading cadre as "sluggish, arrogant, alcoholic, and very阔气(kuò qì - extravagant/ostentatious)." Ding Shen, the head of the art department, wrote more than 80 self-critical big-character posters, made a general review of his bourgeois thoughts, and expressed his determination to transform his thinking in a couplet: "Having allied for thirty years, I wish to break off relations with disasters and no blessings; but with one heart, eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote the proletariat, and there will be a new life." After this big-character poster was posted, someone immediately added a supplement saying: "We are not breaking off relations with bourgeois ideology, but eliminating it."

The situation in other units is equally enthusiastic. The Printing School posted 38,000 big-character posters, more than 50% of which were criticisms and self-criticisms. All kinds of bourgeois thoughts, erroneous remarks, and morally corrupt and degenerate behaviors were exposed without omission. The comrades of this school called it "the first ideological revolution climax in the history of the Printing School." In the Science and Technology Publishing House, ideological exchanges were also very enthusiastic. Some old intellectuals who held leading positions had never conducted self-criticism in the past. After the mass ideological exchange was launched, Mr. Gu Jizhi, director of the editorial department, spent an entire night writing a long big-character poster of more than 2,000 words, reviewing his eighteen shortcomings and expressing his determination to correct them.

The ideological exchange in the Shanghai publishing system's "Double-Anti" movement truly touched on a fundamental problem in the Shanghai publishing system—bourgeois ideology, thus creating conditions for fundamentally changing the backward state of the Shanghai publishing circles. In recent years, all kinds of bourgeois thoughts have been rampant in the Shanghai publishing departments. After the private publishing departments implemented the overall joint state-private ownership, a large number of private personnel also entered the publishing circles, and the personnel became more complex. In units such as the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the Cultural Publishing House, and the Children's Publishing House, the problems were relatively serious. For example, in order to obtain a large amount of manuscript fees, they did not hesitate to use the names of their wives and children to impersonate and receive royalties. The prevalence of this bourgeois ideology has caused many bad consequences such as the low quality of publications, the lack of ideological content, and serious waste. Although these problems have been constantly criticized in the past, the solutions have been very incomplete. After the start of this Double-Anti movement, the masses demanded to eliminate ideological obstacles and solve the problems thoroughly, but these units initially carried out rectification without conducting ideological exchanges, and the movement lacked vitality and could not go deep. Later, under the guidance of the municipal party committee and the active suggestions of the masses, it was decided to switch to ideological criticism, and the movement immediately became raging, finally forming a massive and profound ideological revolutionary movement.

Now, in these units, there has appeared an unprecedentedly vigorous scene, people are energetic and full of enthusiasm. The Children's Publishing House originally planned to publish 270 kinds of books this year, but it has now increased to 420 kinds, and the quality will also be greatly improved. The Science and Technology Publishing House has begun to change its past practice of being seriously divorced from reality. They guarantee that most of the publications this year will directly serve the current industrial and agricultural production. People's relationships have also changed greatly, becoming more intimate, united, and sincere. Ding Shen of the Children's Publishing House said in a big-character poster that after this ideological exchange, "I feel that our society has become more lovely, and the comrades have become more lovely." Zhao Lantian, an old painter in his sixties, wrote a couplet on his sickbed after participating in this ideological criticism: "Criticism makes me feel the warmth of human feelings, criticism makes me know the weakness of my physical strength." Many units have launched the work of formulating individual red and expert plans on the basis of this ideological criticism. Because everyone has made self-examination in this ideological criticism, the formulation of the plan has a good foundation. In this way, the "destruction" of bourgeois ideology has been achieved, and the "establishment" of proletarian ideology has begun, combining "destruction" and "establishment."

    兴无灭资　扫除邪气
    上海出版系统展开思想革命
    为制订个人红专规划打下良好基础
    本报讯　记者季音报道：上海出版系统的二十多个单位，最近在“双反”运动中掀起了一个思想交锋，横扫“六气”的高潮，使“双反”运动真正形成了一次深刻的思想革命。现在，在这些单位里，批评和自我批评的大字报成千累万，各种资产阶级错误思想和“六气”，都受到了群众的揭发和批判。人们见了面就问：“你收到了多少大字报”？如答复说只收到十几张，对方会说“太少了，太少了”。如果答复说“收到了一、二百张”，人们就互相祝贺“丰收，丰收”。
    记者日前参观了扫“六气”运动进行得最热烈的少年儿童出版社。社的领导干部实行了引火烧身的办法，一方面自己写大字报揭发、批判自己，同时也对别人提意见。这样，群众就对领导干部提出了大量的批评，四个主要负责干部共收到了大字报一千一百多张。在思想批判高潮中，群众的积极性空前高涨，很多人用大字报说出了肺腑之言。有一位姓赵的工作人员，过去一向不问政治，沉默寡言，人们叫他“政治哑巴”。这次他也写了近二百张大字报，其中有五十七张大字报是进行自我批评的。有一对夫妇，也相互贴大字报，进行批评。在这些批评中，人们揭露了在追求稿费方面赤裸裸的“拜金主义”，如这个社有四个工作人员，三年内共请“病假”二千三百零三天，创作了儿童作品四十二部，工资照拿，外收稿费一万六千九百多元。一位工作人员自己画了一张漫画批评自己是“白天懒如猫，夜晚凶如虎”（即白天工作没劲，晚上在家创作）。大字报批评一个领导干部对待工作（看稿）是“个人主义的干劲十足，社会主义的干劲缺乏”，另一个领导干部是“暮气沉沉，骄气逼人，酒气熏熏，阔气得很”。美术科科长丁深写了八十多张自我批判的大字报，对自己的资产阶级思想作了总检查，在一幅对联中，他表示自己的思想改造的决心说：“缔盟卅载，有祸无福愿绝交；但生一心，灭资兴无可新生。”这张大字报贴出后，边上立即有人补贴上一张说：“我们对资产阶级思想不是绝交，而是消灭它。”
    在其它单位里，情况同样很热烈，印刷学校贴出了三万八千张大字报，有50％以上都是批评和自我批评的内容，各种资产阶级思想、错误言论，以及道德败坏，腐化堕落等行为，都被揭露无遗。这个学校的同志把它说成是“这是印刷学校有史以来第一次思想革命的大高潮”。科学技术出版社里，思想交锋也很热烈，有些担任领导工作的旧知识分子，过去从未进行过自我批评，这次群众性的思想交锋展开后，编辑部主任顾济之老先生就花了一个晚上，写了一份长达二千多字的大字报，检讨了自己的十八条缺点，并表示决心改正。
    上海出版系统这次“双反”中的思想大交锋，真正接触到了上海出版系统中的一个根本问题——资产阶级思想，因而为根本改变上海出版界的落后状况创造了条件。这几年来，各种各样的资产阶级思想在上海出版部门大为泛滥。私营出版部门实行了全部公私合营后，大批私方人员也进入了出版界，人员更加庞杂。在上海人民美术出版社、文化出版社、少年儿童出版社等单位中，问题都比较严重，如为了获取大量稿费收入，不惜用妻子、儿女的名义冒名顶替，领取版税等等。这种资产阶级思想的泛滥，造成了出版物质量低劣，思想性贫乏，浪费严重等许多恶果。这些问题虽然在过去曾不断受到批判，但解决得很不彻底。这次双反运动开始后，群众即要求扫除思想障碍，彻底解决，但这些单位最初并未进行思想交锋，就进行了整改，运动就缺乏生气，深入不下去。后来经市委领导的指示和群众的积极建议，决定转入思想批判，运动就立即如火如荼，终于形成了一次声势浩大、内容深刻的思想革命运动。
    现在在这些单位里，已出现了一片前所未有的蓬勃景象，人们精神焕发，干劲百倍。少年儿童出版社原计划今年出书二百七十种，现已增加到四百二十种，质量也要大大提高。科学技术出版社已开始改变了过去严重脱离实际的作法。他们保证今年大部分出版物都要直接为当前工农业生产服务。人们的关系也大大改变了，变得更加亲密，团结，真诚。少年儿童出版社的丁深在大字报上说，经过这次思想交锋后，“我觉得我们的社更可爱起来了，同志们也更可爱起来了”。六十多岁的老画家赵蓝天在参加了这次思想批判后，在病床上写了幅对联说：“批评始觉人情厚，批评才知体力微。”许多单位在这次思想批判的基础上，展开了制订个人又红又专规划的工作。由于在这次思想批判中，每个人都作了自我检查，因此规划的制订也就有了良好的基础。这样就做到了“破”资产阶级思想，也开始“立”无产阶级思想，把“破”与“立”结合了起来。
