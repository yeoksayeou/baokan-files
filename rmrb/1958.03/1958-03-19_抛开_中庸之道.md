Abandoning the "Doctrine of the Mean"
Shi Yitao

Everyone is now in the Great Leap Forward, but some comrades stubbornly cling to their right-leaning conservative baggage and are unwilling to let go. The reason for this is that these comrades are to varying degrees, disciples of the "Doctrine of the Mean." Originally, the "Doctrine of the Mean" was a philosophy of personal conduct and worldly wisdom advocated in the feudal era. Unexpectedly, some revolutionary cadres in the socialist era have also become "moderate."

The Guizhou Provincial Party Committee's enlarged meeting criticized a type of person whose attitude towards work was: "Not seeking to be advanced, but seeking stability; not as good as the best, but better than most; wanting to advance, but afraid of rashness; wanting to launch movements, but afraid of movements; leading the masses, but not trusting the masses." This thinking is a typical representation of the "Doctrine of the Mean."

Often, some people have the idea of the "Doctrine of the Mean," but they don't feel there is anything wrong with it. In their view, although I am "not advanced enough," I pay attention to "stability"! Although I am "not as good as the best," I am "better than most"! And so on. Thus, in the Great Leap Forward, they are at ease implementing "slow progress." Some people even see other people's leaps forward as "rash advances," pointing fingers and making criticisms.

In fact, the Leap Forward and rash advances are two completely different things. To plan one's actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective reality, and to reluctantly do things that are truly impossible, is rash advancement. But through effort, to do things that can be done more, faster, better, and more economically, is not rash advancement. For example, the "simplified telegram" from Shanghai to London used to take more than thirty minutes, more than ten minutes longer than the same telegram from London to Shanghai; now, after various efforts, it takes an average of only three minutes and eighteen seconds, about five or six times faster than one from London. This fact fully demonstrates the spirit of the Leap Forward of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau staff. Such things should absolutely not be called "rash advances." There are countless similar facts of the Leap Forward. If everything were determined in advance to be "not as good as the best, but better than most," I am afraid that those amazing miracles would never be created.

Now, we propose to accelerate the speed of socialist construction and strive to catch up with Britain in about fifteen years. Under such circumstances, if some people continue to retain the idea of the "Doctrine of the Mean" in their minds, they will find themselves in a very embarrassing situation. Just imagine: on the one hand, a revolutionary cadre, and on the other hand, a cautious gentleman, participating in the vigorous socialist construction cause with such a dual identity, how can they meet the demands of the revolution? As the enlarged meeting of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee pointed out: such people will "become stumbling blocks in the advance and will eventually be swept away by the tide of the mass movement."

The "Doctrine of the Mean" is not the way of revolution. It is hoped that all comrades with this kind of thinking will be vigilant and resolutely abandon this kind of thinking!

### 抛开“中庸之道”

    抛开“中庸之道”
    石一迢
    现在大家都在大跃进，可是有些同志却死抱着右倾保守的包袱不愿丢手。所以如此，原因就在于这些同志程度不同地充当了“中庸之道”的“道徒”。本来，“中庸之道”是封建时代所提倡的一种立人处世的哲学，不料，一些处在社会主义时代的革命干部竟也“中庸”起来了。
    贵州省委扩大会议上批判了这样一种人，他们对工作的态度是：“不求先进，但求稳当；比上不足，比下有余；既要前进，又怕冒进；想搞运动，又怕运动；领导群众，不信群众。”这种思想，就是典型的“中庸之道”的代表。
    往往是这样，有些人有了“中庸之道”的思想，但他们自己并不觉得这有什么错误。在他们看来，我虽然“不够先进”，但我却注意“稳当”呀！我虽然“比上不足”，但我却“比下有余”呀！如此等等。于是，在大跃进中，他们心安理得地在那里实行“缓进”了。有的人甚至将别人的跃进看做是“冒进”，在那里指手划脚加以议论了。
    其实，跃进和冒进完全是两回事。超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情，这才是冒进。可是经过努力，把本来可以做到的事做得又多又快又好又省，这就不是冒进了。比如：由上海拍往伦敦的“简便公电”，过去需时三十分钟以上，比伦敦拍来上海的同样电报多十几分钟；现在，经过种种努力，平均只有三分十八秒，比伦敦拍来的约快五、六倍。这个事实充分表现了上海电报局工作人员的跃进精神。类似这样的事情绝对不能叫做“冒进”。像这样的跃进的事实，多到不可数计。如果事先都确定来个“比上不足，比下有余”的话，恐怕永远也不会创造出那些惊人的奇迹来。
    现在，我们提出要加速社会主义建设事业的速度，争取在十五年左右的时间内赶上英国。在这样的形势下，如果有些人继续的将“中庸之道”的思想保留在自己的脑海里，那将使自己处于一种很难堪的境地。试想一想：一方面是革命干部，一方面又是谨小慎微的君子，以这样的双重身分来参加轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设事业，怎么能够适应革命的要求呢？诚如贵州省委扩大会议指出：这样的人必将“成为前进中的绊脚石，终要被群众运动的浪潮冲垮”。
    “中庸之道”不是革命之道，希望一切具有这种思想的同志警惕起来，坚决地抛弃这种思想吧！
