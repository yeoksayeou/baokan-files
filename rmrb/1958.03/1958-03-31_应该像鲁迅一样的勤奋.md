    Should Be As Diligent As Lu Xun
    Beijing Postal Bureau Amateur School　Mi Shirong
    Amidst the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, writers have also successively formulated great leap forward creation plans. This makes me think of Mr. Lu Xun's life of work.
    Mr. Lu Xun was always working intensely throughout his life. This became even more pronounced in his later years. In the ten months before his death, he fought against illness while persisting in his work. During this period, the books he "published included 'Old Tales Retold,' 'Medicinal Plants,' 'Dead Souls,' Käthe Kollwitz's 'Selected Prints,' and 'Soviet Prints.' He edited and published 'Hai Shang Lin' Volumes I and II. He edited 'A Collection of Seven Soviet Writers' and collected two books of 'Essays from Qiejieting'." (Xu Guangping: About Lu Xun's Life)
    The scattered articles and other works that Mr. Lu Xun wrote during this period have not been calculated. Calculated in this way, on average, he wrote or edited a book every month. And during these ten months, Mr. Lu Xun spent as much as eight months in bed. Who would believe that a person could do so much work in such a short time? But the great revolutionary writer Mr. Lu Xun achieved such results, and this was obtained through diligence.
    In the era of the Great Leap Forward, writers must also "compete in enthusiasm and strive for the upper reaches," and be as diligent as Mr. Lu Xun, writing more works that reflect real life.

### 应该像鲁迅一样的勤奋

    应该像鲁迅一样的勤奋北京邮局业余学校　宓世荣
    在全国工农业生产大跃进的同时，作家们也纷纷订出大跃进的创作规划。我由此想到鲁迅先生的一生工作。
    鲁迅先生一生，始终都是在紧张的工作着的。到了晚年，就更为突出。在他逝世的前十个月，他一面和病魔搏斗，一面坚持工作。在这个时期里，他“出版的书有‘故事新编’、‘药用植物’、‘死魂灵百图’、珂勒惠支的‘版画选集’和
  ‘苏联版画集’。编校成书的有‘海上述林’上下卷。编好的有‘苏联作家七人集’，还有两本‘且介亭杂文’收集好了。”（许广平：关于鲁迅的生活）
    至于先生在这个时期里所写的零星文章和其它工作，还未计算在内。这样算起来，平均每月要写或编出一本书。而在这十个月当中，先生卧病床上的时间，就有八个月之多。谁会相信一个人能在这样短暂的时间内，做出这么多的工作
              呢？但伟大的革命文学家鲁迅先生，就有这样的成绩，而这是用勤奋得来的。
    在大跃进的时代里，作家们也要“比干劲、争上游”，要像鲁迅先生一样勤奋，多多写出反映现实生活的东西来。
