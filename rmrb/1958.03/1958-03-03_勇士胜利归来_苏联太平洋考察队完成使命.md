Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: According to TASS, the Soviet research vessel "Vityaz" has returned to Vladivostok on February 27th after conducting scientific explorations in the central Pacific Ocean. Sun Jiren, a scientific worker from the Institute of Oceanography and Marine Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, participated in the work of the expedition's fish team.

The "Vityaz" sailed more than 17,000 nautical miles in four months and achieved great results. The expedition investigated the geographical regions of the central Pacific, the circulation of water in the deep ocean, and studied the physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes in the ocean. Scientists also investigated the deep-sea trenches in the southern half of the ocean, determining the depths of the Tonga, Kermadec, and New Hebrides trenches, which had rarely been explored before. In the Tonga Trench area, eight types of deep-sea animals were obtained during underwater observations at a depth of 10,760 meters, some of which were unknown to the scientific community. The fish collection resulted in a complete set of specimens including over a thousand species of fish.

North of the New Hebrides Trench, geologists newly discovered a trench with a depth of more than 6,000 meters, and scientists suggested naming it the "Vityaz Trench." The expedition ship also passed through the Fiji Islands, New Zealand, and New Caledonia. In Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, the expedition members attended a scientific conference attended by scientists from Britain, New Zealand, and France. The Soviet expedition members delivered twelve reports at the conference.

    勇士胜利归来
    苏联太平洋考察队完成使命
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联“勇士号”考察船在太平洋中部进行科学考察后已于2月27日回到海参崴。中国科学院海洋生物研究所的科学工作者孙继仁参加了考察队鱼类小队的工作。
    “勇士号”在四个月中航行了一万七千多海里，取得了巨大成绩。考察队考察了太平洋中部的地理地区、大洋深处的水的循环，研究了大洋内的物理、化学、生物和地质作用。科学家们还考察了大洋南半部的深水凹地，他们确定了从来很少勘察过的东加群岛、刻马得克群岛和新赫布里底群岛凹地的深度。在东加群岛凹地地区，在一万零七百六十公尺的深处进行水底观测时，获取八类深水动物，其中有一些是科学界还不知道的。鱼类搜集的结果，制成了包括千余种鱼的成套标本。
    在新赫布里底群岛凹地以北，地质学家新发现一处深达六千公尺以上的凹地，科学家们建议把它叫做“勇士号凹地”。考察船还经过斐济群岛、新西兰和新喀里多尼亚。在新西兰的首都惠灵顿，考察队员们出席了有英国、新西兰和法国科学家参加的科学会议。苏联考察队员在会议上作了十二个报告。
