    Preventing Forest Fires
    Recently, some areas in Jiangxi Province have experienced continuous forest fires, causing undue damage to national forest resources. Huang Zhaosheng and three other members of the Makeng Agricultural Cooperative in Makeng Township, Yihuang County, went up the mountain to collect thatch chestnuts and, because the firewood was dense and the forest deep, set fire to the thatch, which burned for three full days and nights. In Le'an County, members of the Nanyuan Production Team of the Xianxia Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaochi Township burned field ridges, and the fire spread to Donghua Ridge, causing a forest fire that burned more than 40,000 cedar, tea, and pine trees.
    Currently, it is spring with dry and high winds, making forest fires most likely to occur. All localities must pay close attention.

    防止山火
    近来江西省有些地区，连续发生山火事故，国家森林资源遭到不应有的损失。宜黄县麻坑乡麻坑农业社社员黄招生等四人上山打茅栗，因柴密林深，放火烧茅草，整整烧了三日三晚；乐安县小池乡苋下农业社南元生产队社员烧田塍，火蔓延到东华岭引起山火，烧死杉、茶、松树四万多株。
    目前正是干燥风高的春天，山火最容易发生，各地必须引起高度注意。
