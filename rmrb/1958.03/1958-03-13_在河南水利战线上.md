On the Henan Water Conservancy Front

Old General Huang Zhong Group

At the foot of Longhua Mountain in Shanggou Township, Yu County, people are building the last of the stone dams in the gullies with chiseled stones. Old man Song Gou, sixty-two years old, hasn't been down the mountain for six full days and nights since he and his daughter-in-law Yuan Xiaoxian's "Liu Hulan" group proposed a competition a week ago, and named his group of six old men the "Old General Huang Zhong Group". The members of this group are all over sixty years old, and they say: "Old General Huang Zhong was eighty-two years old and could still ride a horse and shoot arrows. We are only in our sixties, and we must be old Huang Zhongs who control the mountains, overwhelming those new heroes!" No one in the group has ever been absent from work. Old man Zhou Tong, who used to be a stonemason, has a family of five. His two sons are members of the basic construction team for mountain management, and he is the feeder of the agricultural cooperative. I saw this old man on the mountain. He said to me: During mountain management, it's strange, old people seem to have become younger, and children seem to have become adults. His ten-year-old granddaughter can't lift a hoe, but every day, whether it's day or night, she rushes to the mountain. She carries stones on her back, quickly and in large quantities. The grandfather and granddaughter, one carrying and the other building, have built neat and strong valley dams, which have been praised many times. (Kan Feng)

Marriage Doesn't Delay Canal Digging

On the morning of November 25th last year, at the canal construction site west of the Huzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanyang County, Henan Province, teams of earth transporters were running back and forth in droves, and the heavy stone rollers hitting the embankments shook the ground loudly. Everything was no different from usual, but Hu Guangping, who was getting married today, was feeling so restless! She would dig for a while and then stop, quietly looking towards the road leading to Louzhuang. In another three or four hours, she would be married. The joy of the wedding chamber and the fulfillment of life all surged into her heart. But suddenly a loud noise interrupted her thoughts. In front of her, the sound of rollers hitting the ground and cheers accompanied by hurried footsteps on the construction site were like a battle. She was attracted by this fiery scene. She thought, to realize water conservancy and turn saline-alkali depressions into rice paddies, to transform grain-deficient counties into surplus grain counties, the cooperative members were forgetting their fatigue and working day and night. But she was here indulging in wild thoughts. Thinking of this, she dug even harder. Cooperative director Hu Wenbin repeatedly advised her: "Don't dig anymore, go home quickly, the car will be here soon." Hu Guangping said with a smile: "It won't delay anything, let me dig for a while longer." Someone joked: "If you don't dig anymore, you won't be able to dig when you become a new daughter-in-law in Louzhuang." Hu Guangping said: "Don't worry, when I get to Louzhuang, I will definitely not sit at home as a new daughter-in-law. I will dig wherever I go." She dug vigorously until after ten o'clock, and she only left the construction site when the car from Louzhuang was about to arrive.

Shock Brigade Members

At the foot of the Funiu Mountains, at the Xitumengkou Reservoir construction site in Masi Township, Dengfeng County, the water dam has now been built more than two zhang high; the fifty-meter-long culvert is about to be completed; the riverbed, which was originally a pile of rubble, now has a neat paved layer of one hundred and thirty-five meters long and thirty meters wide. The youth shock brigade members are rushing to build a small road for pushing soil as the top of the dam rises.

On a steep path, we can see Zhang Shitou, the creator of the new earth-digging record on this construction site. This young man, wearing only a single shirt and sweating profusely, is running and walking to deliver a full basket of soil to the dam foundation. He can push sixty to seventy baskets of soil a day, and can dig and push ten cubic meters of soil. We also saw Li Huaying, a young female hero on this construction site. She is only fourteen years old, but she has become famous on the construction site for pushing three or four hundred catties of soil in one cart. The small red flag on her earth-moving cart is particularly dazzling.

Schematic diagram of the water storage and irrigation network in Malan Township, Yanling County. This is also a microcosm of the water conservancy network in the eastern Henan plain. Arranged horizontally in the direction of backwater are horizontal contour ponds (or horizontal contour belts with small reservoirs); built in the direction of the flow are longitudinal bead-like ponds. Drainage ditches are built on both sides of the road to both drain floods and store water in sections. The horizontal contour trenches and longitudinal drainage ditches connect various water storage projects in series, forming a water storage and irrigation network with interconnected ditches and ponds. When there is a flood, water can be stored, and when there is a drought, water can be diverted for irrigation (97% of the dry land in the township has been turned into irrigated land). A single rainfall of 200 millimeters, a rainstorm that occurs once in ten years, can be intercepted and stored on the spot and controlled section by section, without causing flood runoff. When the rain is even heavier, the excess floodwater is allowed to flow through the horizontal contour trenches and into the drainage ditches in sequence, and discharged section by section into the flood storage area (i.e., large flood storage reservoirs). Water can be commanded to go where it is told to go, and stop where it is told to stop, and go wherever it is needed.

    在河南水利战线上
    老将黄忠组
    禹县尚沟乡龙化山脚下，人们正在用凿好的石头砌垒最后的几条毛沟里的谷坊。六十二岁的老汉宋狗自从一周前和他的儿媳妇袁孝仙领导的“刘胡兰”小组提出竞赛，并把自己领导的由六个老汉组成的小组命名为“老将黄忠组”以后，已经整整六天六夜没下山了。这个小组的组员们年龄都在六十岁以上，他们说：“老将黄忠八十二岁，还能骑马射箭，我们才六十多些，一定要作个治山的老黄忠，压倒那些新英雄！”全组从来没有一人缺过勤。过去曾经作过石匠的老汉周同，一家五口，他的两个儿子都是治山基本建设队的队员，他是农业社的饲养员。在山上我看到了这个老头，他对我说：在治山当中，说也奇怪，老年人好像变年青了，小孩们好像变成大人了。他的十来岁的小孙女，拿不动镢头，每天不论白天，晚上，都争抢着上山。她用脊梁背石头，背得又快，又多。祖孙二人，一个背，一个垒，砌成的谷坊，整齐坚固，受到了多次表扬。　（阚枫）
    结婚不误挖渠
    去年11月25日的早晨，在河南省原阳县胡庄农业社西面的渠道工地上，成群结队的运土队川流不息地奔跑着，沉重的石硪打在堤岸上把大地震得乱响。这一切和往日并没有什么不同，可是今天就要出嫁的胡广平，心里是多么不平静啊！她挖一会土就停下来，向着通往娄庄的大道上悄悄地探望着。再有三、四个钟头就要结婚了，洞房的欢乐，生活的美满，一齐拥上了她的心头。但突然一阵巨大的声响打断了她的沉思。在她前面，工地上打硪声、欢呼声伴随着急促的脚步声，真像打仗的一样。她被这火热的场面所吸引，她想，社员们要实现水利化，改盐碱洼地作稻田，把缺粮县变成余粮县，他们忘记了疲劳，不分昼夜地劳动着，咱却在这里胡思乱想。她想到这里，挖渠特别起劲。社长胡文斌三番二次地劝她说：“别挖啦，快回家吧，一会车子就来了。”胡广平笑着说：“耽误不了啥，让我再挖一会。”有人开玩笑说：“再不挖，到了娄庄当了新媳妇可就挖不成了。”胡广平说：“放心吧，到了娄庄坚决不坐在家里当新媳妇，我走到哪里就挖到哪里。”她一股劲挖到十点多钟，直到娄庄的车子快来了，她才离开了工地。

    突击队员
    伏牛山脚下，登封县马寺庄乡西土门口水库工地上，现在拦水坝已筑起二丈多高；长达五十公尺的涵管就要完工；原来是乱石成堆的河底，现在已出现了一块一百三十五公尺长，三十多公尺宽的整齐的平铺层。青年突击队员随着坝顶的提高，正在赶修推土用的小路。
    在一条峻峭的小路上，我们可以看到这个工地上挖土新纪录的创造者张石头。这个年青人身穿单汗衫，满头流着大汗，正连跑带走地把一满筐土送到坝基上。他一天能推六、七十筐土，可以连挖带推做到十个土方。我们也看到了这个工地上的少年女英雄李花英，她年仅十四岁，但是却以一车能推三、四百斤土在工地上出了名。她的推土车上的小红旗特别耀眼。

    鄢陵县马拦乡蓄水灌溉网示意图　这也是河南省豫东平原地区水利网的缩影。按着逆水方向，横着排列的是水平线坑塘（或叫水平线带小水库）；顺水方向修成的是纵行的串珠式坑塘，道路两侧修成既可排洪，又能节节蓄水的排洪渠。本乡流水方向是由西北向东南，按逆水方向，修水平沟（或叫截水沟），水平沟作为拦水道，通过水平沟引水入坑塘。横行的水平沟和纵行的排洪渠把各种蓄水工程连串起来，形成渠塘相通，塘塘相连的蓄水灌溉网。涝时可蓄水，天旱就引水灌溉（全乡97％的旱地变成水浇地）。一次降雨二百公厘，十年一遇的暴雨，可以就地拦蓄，节节控制，不发生洪水迳流。雨再大时，就让过量洪水通过水平沟，顺序流入排洪渠，逐节顺序下放，流入蓄洪区（即大型蓄洪水库）。可以让水听指挥，叫它走就走，叫它停就停，哪里用就让它哪里去。
