    Lhasa is Busy with Spring Plowing
    Several spring snows have fallen recently on the Lhasa plain, and spring plowing has begun. The agricultural loan work team of the Tibet Branch of the People's Bank of China has arrived in more than 30 zong (districts) and xiqia (estates) in the Lhasa area to deliver grain, barley, and wheat seeds to the vast number of farmers.
    Currently, the People's Bank has dispatched dozens of agricultural and pastoral interest-free loan work teams, bringing more than 2.6 million jin of loan grain and partial loans to rural areas and grasslands throughout Tibet. The loan grain has increased by 150,000 jin compared to last year.

    拉萨春耕忙
    拉萨平原上最近一连下了几场春雪，春耕已经开始。中国人民银行西藏分行的农贷工作组，这几天已陆续到达拉萨地区的三十多个宗、溪卡，给广大农户送去粮食，送去青稞、小麦的种籽。
    现在，人民银行已派出了几十个发放农牧业无息贷款的工作组，为西藏各地农村和草原带去二百六十多万斤贷粮和部分贷款，贷粮比去年增加十五万斤。（新华社）
