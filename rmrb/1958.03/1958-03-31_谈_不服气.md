    On "Not Being Convinced"
    Tian Lianqian
    During the rural rectification campaign, especially in the rectification of the "three types of townships and three types of cooperatives," some grassroots cadres were replaced, demoted, or failed to be re-elected due to serious capitalist tendencies, decline in revolutionary will, corruption, and so on. Since these cadres had committed serious mistakes and lost the trust of the masses, they should sincerely repent and do more good deeds. However, the attitude of some of them was the opposite: some unelected cadres not only did not do good deeds but also undermined the new cadres; some demoted cadres put aside their capable work and deliberately watched the new cadres make mistakes. This situation existed in the Tianjin Special Zone of Hebei Province.
    What is the reason? It is said to be "not being convinced." "Not being convinced" is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes it is even a sign of ambition. China is a large socialist country, but our heavy industry currently lags behind capitalist Britain. We are not convinced about this situation, so everyone is mobilized to strive to catch up with Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in about fifteen years. This kind of "not being convinced" is naturally good. In our daily work, for the sake of the interests of the people, we are unwilling to lag behind and actively strive for progress. If others do well and we don't, we actively find ways to catch up or surpass them. When others do work that we cannot do well, we also wholeheartedly help them. Isn't this the attitude of revolutionary heroism? There are many such examples in real life. However, if a person's "not being convinced" stems from personal reputation and status, and they are unwilling to let others do things they cannot do well, and they do not help others when they can, or even undermine others, this kind of individualistic approach must be corrected.
    Now, the people of the whole country are working day and night on socialist construction, with the aim of rapidly changing the poor and backward state of our country, which is of great importance to everyone and their descendants. In the countryside, after several months of socialist education, the political consciousness of the peasant masses has been raised to an unprecedented level, and socialist enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly high. The movement to strive for a great leap forward in agricultural production is in full swing; but some unelected and demoted cadres seem completely indifferent. The great rectification movement seems to have had no impact on their thinking. They completely retain the old ways of thinking from before the rectification.
    How to treat such people and such things is a question that should be given special attention by all localities after the rectification of the Party and the cooperatives. All localities should use a certain amount of effort to educate these people while organizing production, change their thinking and attitudes, organize them to actively participate in production and construction, and use their wisdom and strength for the socialist cause. They only have the responsibility to actively support and help the new cadres elected by the people, and they are never allowed to undermine them behind their backs. Those who engage in such behavior should be criticized. Those who still do not change after being criticized should be punished.

    谈“不服气”
    田连阡
    在农村整风整社、特别是整顿三类乡三类社的时候，有一部分基层干部由于资本主义倾向严重或者革命意志衰退、腐化堕落等原因，被撤换、降职或者落选了。这些干部既然犯了严重的错误，失去了群众的信任，他们就应该诚心诚意地痛改前非，多做好事。然而他们当中有些人的态度却相反：有些落选的干部不仅不办好事，还拆新干部的台；有些降职的干部则放下自己能干的工作不干，故意看新干部的笑话。河北天津专区就有这种情形。
    原因是什么呢？据说是“不服气”。“不服气”本来并不一定是坏事情，有时甚至还是有志气的表现。中国是个社会主义的大国，但是我们的重工业目前还赶不上资本主义的英国，我们对这个情况是不服气的，因此人人动员，一定要争取在十五年左右在钢铁及其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国，这种不服气自然是好的。在我们日常工作中，凡是为了人民群众的利益，不甘落后，积极进取，别人做好了我没做好，我就积极想办法赶上或者超过别人；自己做不好的工作别人来做时，也全心全意帮助别人，这正是革命英雄主义的态度么？这样的例子在现实生活中是很多的。但是，如果一个人的不服气是从个人名誉地位出发，自己做不好的事情又不愿让别人做，别人做时自己能帮忙的也不帮忙，甚至拆别人的台，这种个人主义的办法必须纠正。
    现在全国人民都在废寝忘食地进行社会主义建设，目的是迅速改变我国贫困和落后的面貌，这对每个人及其子孙后代都有很大的关系。在农村，经过几个月的社会主义教育，农民群众的政治觉悟空前提高，社会主义热情空前高涨，争取农业生产大跃进的运动搞得热火朝天；而有些落选和降职的干部却似乎完全无动于衷。伟大的整风运动，看来对他们的思想并没有发生影响。他们完全保留着整风以前的旧东西。
    怎样对待这样的人和这样的事，是各地在整风、整社以后应当特别注意的问题。各地在组织生产中应当同时用一定的力量对这些人进行教育，改变他们的思想和态度，组织他们积极参加生产和建设，把他们的智慧和力量用到社会主义事业上来。对于人民选出的新干部，他们只有积极支持和帮助的责任，决不容许背后拆台。有这种行为的，应当给以批评。批评了仍然不改的，应当给予处分。
