    Train Without Vendors
    On a passenger train departing from Beijing to Shanghai at 6:52 AM on March 3rd, there were no vendors. This is the first "passenger train without vendors" in the country, successfully trialed by the Shanghai Railway Bureau.
    On this train, dining car staff also handled tea stove boiling, the dining car director also managed financial work, and train attendants also did fetching water, delivering water, and rinsing teacups.
    According to preliminary statistics, implementing this method on major routes such as Shanghai-Beijing, Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Lanzhou, Shanghai-Nanning (Pingxiang), and Shanghai-Changzhou alone can save the state nearly 90,000 yuan annually.

    不设售货员的列车
    3月3日六时五十二分从北京开到上海的一列旅客列车上，没有一个售货员。这是上海铁路局试行成功的全国第一列“没有售货员的旅客列车”。
    在这列客车上，餐车人员兼司茶炉烧水，餐车主任兼管财务工作，列车员兼做挑水、送水及冲茶洗茶杯等工作。
    据初步统计，仅该局沪京、沪津、沪兰、沪南（平）、沪常等主要线路推行这个办法，每年就可为国家节省开支近九万元。
