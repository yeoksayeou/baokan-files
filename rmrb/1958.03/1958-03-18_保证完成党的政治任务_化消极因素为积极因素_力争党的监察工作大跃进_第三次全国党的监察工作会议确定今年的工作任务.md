The Third National Party Supervisory Work Conference Determines This Year's Work Tasks
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Supervisory Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Third National Party Supervisory Work Conference from March 1st to March 10th. Attending the meeting were 123 people, including the secretaries or deputy secretaries of the supervisory committees of 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, 28 provincial-level cities and prefectures, and 8 counties, as well as responsible cadres for supervisory work from central state organs and the People's Liberation Army. Comrade Liu Lantao delivered the opening address, and Comrade Wang Congwu gave a "Report on the Summary of Work in 1957 and the Work Tasks for 1958" on behalf of the Central Supervisory Committee. During the discussions at the meeting, the comrades who attended spoke enthusiastically, earnestly criticized right-leaning conservative thinking and various erroneous understandings in the Party's supervisory work, summarized work experiences, determined the work tasks for 1958, and proposed specific measures to strengthen political and ideological work, improve work methods, and improve work style. The meeting was filled with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and filled with a strong revolutionary will to muster revolutionary zeal, strive for progress, and do everything possible to achieve a leap forward in supervisory work. This was a conference to promote and leap forward in the Party's supervisory work.

    The rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle were a great review of the ideological and political thinking of Party members and a great inspection of the Party's organization and discipline.

    The meeting held that the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle were a great review of the ideological and political thinking of Party members and a great inspection of the Party's organization and discipline. The rectification and anti-Rightist struggle once again showed that our Party is glorious, great, and correct; the vast majority of Party members are loyal to the cause of the Party, have a firm stance, strictly abide by Party discipline, and can withstand the test of struggle. At the same time, the movement also exposed a group of Rightist elements hidden within the Party, various bad elements, serious violators of law and discipline, incorrigible corrupt and degenerate elements, and those with serious bourgeois individualism in thought and behavior who have repeatedly refused to change despite education; it also exposed some Party members with serious right-leaning thoughts, tendencies to take the capitalist road, localism, bourgeois nationalism, and other various erroneous thoughts and behaviors that violated Party discipline. These problems exposed within the Party, for our entire Party, are only a small finger or half a finger out of ten fingers. However, the harm it causes to the cause of the Party and the people cannot be ignored. If we do not expose and remove Rightist elements and various bad elements hidden within the Party; and if we do not thoroughly criticize or investigate and deal with various erroneous thoughts and behaviors that violate Party discipline, we cannot purify the Party ranks, consolidate Party unity, and the Party will not be able to successfully lead the people of the whole country to realize socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    In 1957, Party supervisory organizations at all levels, under the leadership of the central and local Party committees, closely focused on the rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the Party's various central tasks, carried out a resolute struggle against bad people and bad deeds within the Party, and correctly and promptly investigated and dealt with a large number of cases of Party members violating Party discipline, which played a positive role in purifying and consolidating the Party's organization, enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness, and ensuring the implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies; at the same time, the Party's supervisory work also achieved new development and accumulated some important experiences. The meeting held that the Party's supervisory work in 1957 achieved great results and made rapid progress. However, there were also some shortcomings and errors in the work, mainly that some Party supervisory organizations and cadres had right-leaning conservative ideas, were not vigorous in fighting against bad people and bad deeds and violations of law and discipline within the Party, and their work lagged behind the requirements of the situation; some supervisory cadres had serious bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjective work styles.

    The Main Experiences of the Party's Supervisory Work

    (1) Closely arrange one's own work around the Party's political tasks and central work; (2) Systematically criticize right-leaning conservative thinking and various erroneous understandings; (3) Strictly distinguish between the boundaries of enemy-us problems and intra-Party right-wrong problems and treat them separately; (4) Big contending, big blooming, and big-character posters are new forms of struggle against all violations of law and discipline and bad people and bad deeds; (5) Reviewing past cases must be based on the situation of class struggle and the Party's policies at that time and place, and past cases cannot be overturned based on what is suitable for today's situation and policies.

    The meeting summarized several main experiences of the Party's supervisory work in 1957.

  (1) Party supervisory organizations must, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, closely arrange their own work around the Party's political tasks and central work, so that departmental work serves the Party's political tasks and central work, and carry out Party supervisory work in the process of realizing the Party's political tasks. This is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in supervisory work. Only in this way can the role of Party discipline in guaranteeing the Party's line and political tasks be fully brought into play. Deviating from the Party's political tasks and handling cases in isolation will inevitably lead to losing one's way; leaving departmental business and focusing solely on central work will also weaken the Party's supervisory work and be detrimental to the realization of the Party's political tasks.

  (2) To smoothly carry out the Party's supervisory work, it is necessary to systematically criticize right-leaning conservative thinking and various erroneous understandings, strengthen political and ideological leadership, and run political and ideological work like a red thread through all specific tasks; one cannot deviate from politics and handle cases in isolation, nor can one leave business and engage in empty talk about politics. Right-leaning conservative thinking in the Party's supervisory work is a reflection of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thinking and is a manifestation of ideological lagging behind objective reality in the situation of revolutionary leap forward development. The existence of this kind of thinking without correction will inevitably lead to neglecting the struggle against erroneous tendencies within the Party, reducing or losing principle in the implementation of Party discipline, thereby making supervisory work deviate from political tasks and weakening the combat effectiveness of supervisory work. (3) The fundamental principle that Party supervisory organizations must observe and handle problems is to strictly distinguish between the boundaries of enemy-us problems and intra-Party right-wrong problems and treat them separately. Anti-revolutionary elements, Rightist elements, and other various bad elements who have infiltrated the Party are strongholds and agents established by class enemies within the Party. Once discovered, they must be resolutely dug out, and there must be no leniency or sentimentality. Although this enemy-us contradiction is small, it cannot be ignored at any time. On the other hand, it should be seen that the largest amount of intra-Party struggle is intra-Party right-wrong problems. When dealing with comrades who have made mistakes within the Party, we must help them correct their mistakes with full enthusiasm, benevolence, and utmost effort, and we cannot take simple organizational measures. Only in this way can we strike at the enemy, protect comrades, maintain Party unity, and consolidate and purify the Party organization. Confusing the boundaries between two different types of problems will inevitably lead to rightist or "leftist" errors. (4) Big contending, big blooming, big debate, big character posters are a new form of mobilizing Party members and the masses to conduct self-education and struggle against all violations of law and discipline and bad people and bad deeds. When examining and handling cases, Party supervisory organizations must, on the one hand, rely on Party grassroots organizations and the masses, and make full use of this form; on the other hand, they must conduct careful investigation and research, verify facts, and review materials, so that the work of examining and handling cases by supervisory organs is combined with the mass movement. (5) Reviewing appealed cases in past revolutionary movements must be based on the situation of class struggle and the Party's policies at that time and place to measure the punishment at that time, and past cases cannot be overturned based on policies suitable for today's situation; it is necessary to adhere to principles and correct mistakes under the condition of affirming the achievements of the revolutionary movement and protecting the activists of the revolutionary movement. The meeting held that, in order to improve the ideological and combat nature of the Party's supervisory work, it is necessary to continue to criticize right-leaning thoughts and other various erroneous understandings in the Party's supervisory work in the past period. For example, some people believe that "since the victory of the three major socialist transformations, the class struggle has ended, therefore, Party discipline is not important." Now they say, "After the rectification and anti-Rightist struggle is over, Party discipline is not important." The meeting criticized these ideas that attempted to abolish or weaken Party discipline. In the transition period, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, between the capitalist road and the socialist road, is not only long-term but also complex, and at the same time, this struggle will inevitably be reflected within the Party. We must never underestimate the inevitability and long-term nature of bourgeois ideological corrosion of the Party and enemy sabotage of the Party. All Party members must recognize the importance and necessity of strengthening Party discipline in the transition period. Lenin said, "Whoever slightly weakens the iron discipline within the proletarian party (especially during the period of the proletarian dictatorship) is actually helping the bourgeoisie to oppose the proletariat." This is something we can never forget.

    Party Discipline Cannot Be Weakened

    Ideological Education Must Be Insisted Upon

    The meeting criticized some people for mechanically opposing the implementation of Party discipline and ideological education. They distorted the Party's correct policy of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient" adopted towards comrades who made mistakes, and believed that "curing the sickness to save the patient means that we can only educate and cannot punish, and punishing cannot cure the sickness to save the patient." The meeting held that, in order to overcome Party members' erroneous thoughts and behaviors, the main and regular method is of course ideological education, but relying solely on education is not enough. Therefore, the Party Constitution stipulates that disciplinary action should be taken against those who violate Party discipline. Imposing disciplinary action on comrades who have made mistakes is also a kind of education, a kind of help, so as to prevent their small mistakes from becoming big mistakes, until they reach the point of being incorrigible.

    The meeting also criticized the erroneous saying that "implementing Party discipline hinders Party unity and creates negative factors." Our Party is the promoter of all advancing causes, but there are also some negative factors within the Party, which are the reflections of all non-proletarian thoughts, especially bourgeois thoughts, within the Party. Strengthening Party discipline, opposing various erroneous tendencies within the Party, and removing bad people are precisely to overcome the negative factors within the Party, give play to positive factors, and ensure Party unity.

    This meeting focused on criticizing right-leaning thoughts in the understanding of Party discipline, and at the same time, it also criticized "left" thoughts, for example, some people believe that "serious caution means severe punishment for Party members who make mistakes"; or believe that: "Rural Party members are backward, and even if they are not expelled, they must be placed on probation within the Party, and other punishments are ineffective," and so on.

    The Party's Supervisory Work Also Needs a Great Leap Forward

    Contact the Masses to Eliminate Bureaucratic Airs; Invigorate the Spirit to Sweep Away Lethargy

    Be Humble and Prudent to Overcome Arrogance; Be Resilient and Tenacious to Oppose Squeamishness

    Be Diligent and Frugal to Oppose Extravagance; Be Strict with Oneself to Eliminate Resentment

    According to the situation and tasks of the Party in 1958, the meeting determined the tasks of the Party's supervisory work in 1958: under the leadership of the central and local Party committees, closely focus on the rectification movement and the Party's central tasks such as vigorously developing the national economy, and correctly examine and handle various cases of violation of Party discipline. Resolutely and thoroughly remove Rightist elements, anti-revolutionary elements, various bad elements, serious violators of law and discipline, incorrigible corrupt and degenerate elements, and those with serious bourgeois individualism in thought and behavior who have repeatedly refused to change despite education from within the Party. Focus on grasping cases belonging to the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, grasping cases that undermine Party unity, and grasping cases that endanger the great leap forward of the national economy, oppose various violations of law and discipline within the Party, purify and consolidate the Party organization, strengthen the Party's organization and discipline, and guarantee the complete victory of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle and the comprehensive great leap forward of the national economy.

    The meeting conducted research and discussion on the policy and boundary issues for dealing with Party members' violations of Party discipline.

    The meeting held that, in order to make the Party's supervisory work adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in socialist revolution and socialist construction across the country and ensure the realization of the Party's political tasks and central tasks, the Party's supervisory work also needs a great leap forward. The comrades who attended the meeting all agreed that the Party's supervisory work should leap forward and can also leap forward. The meeting required all Party supervisory cadres to do everything possible to overcome all difficulties, muster their enthusiasm, study diligently, and strive for a comprehensive leap forward in supervisory work. It also pointed out that to strive for a great leap forward in supervisory work, the first thing is to strengthen political and ideological leadership, recognize the situation, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, break with convention, and first have a great leap forward in ideology. Second, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, closely focus on the Party's political tasks, clarify the goals of the struggle, and clarify the policy boundaries for handling cases of violation of Party discipline. Third, improve work methods and overcome empiricism. It requires supervisory committees at all levels to strictly abide by the principle of the Party's unified leadership, earnestly implement the system of combining collective leadership with individual division of labor and responsibility; do a good job in comprehensive planning, diligently conduct inspections; organize evaluations: compare leadership methods, compare political and ideological work, compare the quality and efficiency of handling cases, compare grassroots supervisory work, compare propaganda and education work; leading cadres should spend four months or more of the year going deep into the grassroots level, grasping typical examples, engaging in "experimental fields" in supervisory work, and summarizing the creations of the masses. Fourth, Party supervisory cadres should work hard and squeeze time to study Marxism-Leninism, study the Party's policies, study Chairman Mao's works, study dialectical materialism, closely connect with reality, improve their political and ideological level, and improve their ability to identify. When looking at problems, they must have a clear class viewpoint, start from an overall perspective, have a historical viewpoint, look at the essence of the problem, and avoid subjectivity, one-sidedness, and superficiality. Party supervisory cadres must strengthen Party spirit training, must contact the masses, eliminate bureaucratic airs; invigorate the spirit, muster their enthusiasm, and sweep away lethargy; be humble and prudent, overcome arrogance; be resilient and tenacious, not be afraid of difficulties, and oppose squeamishness; be diligent and frugal, oppose extravagance; and be strict with themselves to eliminate resentment. They must dare to struggle against unhealthy tendencies and evil practices, and in order to adhere to the truth, they must not be afraid of being "scolded" and struggle relentlessly against various violations of law and discipline, bad people and bad deeds within the Party. Party supervisory cadres must love their work, be loyal to their duties, and be good promoters; they must be absolutely loyal to the Party, be selfless and impartial, be models in abiding by Party discipline, adhere to the principle that supervisors must also be supervised, improve organization and discipline, humbly accept the supervision of Party organizations and the masses, earnestly listen to different opinions, and oppose privilege thinking.

    Finally, the meeting held that the tasks of Party supervisory organizations at all levels in 1958 are arduous and difficult, but also very glorious. As long as we are under the leadership of the central and local Party committees, rely on the masses, guard against arrogance and rashness, muster revolutionary zeal, and do everything possible to improve our work, we will surely victoriously complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    保证完成党的政治任务　化消极因素为积极因素
    力争党的监察工作大跃进
    第三次全国党的监察工作会议确定今年的工作任务
    本报讯　中共中央监察委员会在3月1日到3月10日召开了第三次全国党的监察工作会议。出席会议的有二十七个省、市、自治区、二十八个省属市、地、八个县监委的书记或副书记、中央国家机关、解放军的监察工作负责干部等一百二十三人。会议由刘澜涛同志致开幕词，王从吾同志代表中央监委作了“关于1957年工作总结和1958年工作任务的报告”。在会议讨论中，出席会议的同志热烈发言，认真地批判了党的监察工作中的右倾保守思想和各种错误认识，总结了工作经验，确定了1958年的工作任务，提出了加强政治思想工作，改进工作方法，改进作风的具体措施。会议充满了批评和自我批评的精神，充满了鼓起革命干劲，力争上游，千方百计争取监察工作跃进的旺盛革命意志。这是党的监察工作的一次促进大会和跃进大会。
    整风运动和反右派斗争，是一次对党员思想政治上的大检阅，对党的组织性和纪律性的大检查。
    会议认为，整风运动和反右派斗争，是一次对党员思想政治上的大检阅，是一次对党的组织性和纪律性的大检查。整风和反右派斗争又一次表明，我们党是光荣的、伟大的、正确的；绝大多数党员是忠于党的事业，立场坚定，严格遵守党的纪律，经得起斗争考验的。同时，在运动中也揭发出来了一批隐藏在党内的右派分子，各种坏分子，严重违法乱纪分子，不可救药的腐化堕落分子，有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想和行为屡教不改的分子；还揭发出一些党员有严重的右倾思想，走资本主义道路的倾向，地方主义，资产阶级民族主义和其他各种错误思想和违反党纪的行为。党内暴露出来的这些问题，对我们整个党来说，不过是十个指头中的一个小指头或者是半个指头。但是，它对党的事业和人民的事业的危害性，却是不容忽视的。如果我们不把隐藏在党内的右派分子和各种坏分子揭露出来，并清除出党；对各种错误思想和违反党纪的行为不加以彻底地批判或检查处理，就不能纯洁党的队伍，巩固党的团结和统一，党也就不能够胜利地领导全国人民实现社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    1957年党的各级监察组织，在中央和各级党委领导下，密切围绕整风、反右派斗争和党的各项中心工作，向党内的坏人坏事进行了坚决的斗争，正确及时地检查处理了大量的党员违反党的纪律的案件，对于纯洁和巩固党的组织，提高党的战斗力，保证党的方针、政策的贯彻执行起了积极的作用；同时，党的监察工作也获得了新的开展，积累了一些重要的经验。会议认为，1957年党的监察工作成绩很大，进步很快。但是，工作上也还有一些缺点和错误，主要的是有些党的监察组织和干部中存在着右倾保守思想，对党内的坏人坏事和违法乱纪现象斗争不力，工作落后于形势的要求；有些监察干部存在着严重的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义作风。
    党的监察工作的主要经验
    （1）密切围绕党的政治任务和中心工作来安排自己的工作；（2）系统地批判右倾保守思想和各种错误认识；（3）严格划清敌我问题和党内是非问题的界限，分别对待；（4）大鸣、大争、大字报，是向一切违法乱纪现象和坏人坏事作斗争的新形式；（5）复议过去的案件，必须根据当时当地阶级斗争的情况和党的政策，不能以适合今天的情况和政策翻过去的案。
    会议总结了1957年党的监察工作的几点主要经验。
  （一）党的监察组织必须在党委统一领导下，密切围绕党的政治任务和中心工作来安排自己的工作，使部门工作为党的政治任务和中心工作服务，并且在实现党的政治任务中，开展党的监察工作，这是做好监察工作的根本保证。也只有这样，才能充分发挥党的纪律保证党的路线和政治任务的作用。脱离党的政治任务，孤立办案，必然会迷失方向；离开部门的业务，专搞中心工作，也会削弱党的监察工作，而不利于党的政治任务的实现。
  （二）顺利地开展党的监察工作，必须系统地批判右倾保守思想和各种错误认识，加强政治思想领导，把政治思想工作像一条红线一样贯串到各项具体工作中去，既不能脱离政治，孤立办案；也不能离开业务，空谈政治。党的监察工作中的右倾保守思想，是资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想的反映，是在革命跃进发展的形势下，思想落后于客观实际的表现。存在这种思想而不加以纠正，必然忽视对党内错误倾向作斗争，在执行党纪中降低或丧失原则性，从而使监察工作脱离政治任务，削弱监察工作的战斗力。（三）党的监察组织观察和处理问题必须遵守的根本原则是，严格划清敌我问题和党内是非问题的界限，分别对待。混入党内的反革命分子、右派分子和其他各种坏分子，是阶级敌人在党内建立的据点和代理人，一经发现，必须坚决挖掉，不能有任何的姑息和温情。这种敌我矛盾虽然是小量的，但是在任何时候都不能忽视，另一方面，应该看到在党内斗争中最大量的是党内是非问题。对待党内犯错误的同志，必须满腔热忱、仁至义尽地帮助他们改正错误，不能采取简单的组织手段。只有这样，才能够打击敌人，保护同志，维护党的团结，巩固和纯洁党的组织。而混淆两类不同性质问题的界限，就必然犯右的或“左”的错误。（四）大鸣、大放、大争、大辩、大字报，是动员党员和群众进行自我教育，向一切违法乱纪现象和坏人坏事作斗争的一种新形式。党的监察组织在检查处理案件的时候，一方面要依靠党的基层组织，依靠群众，充分利用这一种形式；另一方面，要认真地进行调查研究，核对事实，审查材料，使监察机关的检查处理案件工作同群众运动结合起来。（五）复议过去历次革命运动中的申诉案件，必须根据当时当地阶级斗争的情况和党的政策，去衡量当时的处分，而不能以适合今天情况的政策，翻过去的案；必须在肯定革命运动成果，保护革命运动积极分子的条件下，坚持原则，纠正错误。会议认为，为了提高党的监察工作的思想性、战斗性，有必要继续批判过去一个时期内党的监察工作中的右倾思想和其他各种错误认识。例如，有人认为，“自社会主义三大改造取得胜利以后，阶级斗争结束了，因此，党的纪律不重要了”。现在又说，“整风反右派斗争结束以后，党的纪律不重要了。”会议批判了这些企图取消或削弱党的纪律的思想。在过渡时期，资产阶级同无产阶级、资本主义道路同社会主义道路的斗争，不仅是长期的，而且是复杂的，同时，这种斗争必然会反映到党内来。我们决不能低估资产阶级思想腐蚀党和敌人破坏党的必然性和长期性。全体党员必须认识在过渡时期加强党的纪律的重要性和必要性，列宁说，“谁只要稍微减弱无产阶级党内铁的纪律（特别是在无产阶级专政时期），那他在实际上就是帮助资产阶级来反对无产阶级”。这是我们任何时候都不能忘记的。
    党的纪律不能削弱
    思想教育必须坚持
    会议批评了有些人把执行党的纪律和思想教育机械地对立起来的观点。他们曲解党对犯错误同志所采取的“惩前毖后，治病救人”的正确方针，认为“治病救人就是只能教育不能处分，处分就不能治病救人。”会议认为，为了克服党员的错误思想和行为，主要的、经常的方法，当然是思想教育，但是，光靠教育是不行的，因此，党章规定，对违反党的纪律的人，应该给以纪律处分。对于犯错误的同志执行纪律处分，也是一种教育，是一种帮助，以免他们的小错变成大错，直到不可救药的地步。
    会议还批判了认为“执行党的纪律，有碍党的团结，是制造消极因素”的错误说法。我们党是一切前进事业的促进派，但是党内也存有一些消极因素，这就是一切非无产阶级思想，特别是资产阶级思想在党内的反映。加强党的纪律，反对党内各种错误倾向，清除坏人，正是为了克服党内的消极因素，发挥积极因素，保证党的团结和统一。
    这次会议着重批判了对党的纪律的认识上的右倾思想，同时，也批判了“左”的思想，例如，有人认为“严肃谨慎就是对犯错误的党员严厉处分”；或认为：“农村党员落后，要处分不开除也得留党察看，其他处分不顶事”等等错误认识。
    党的监察工作也需要来个大跃进
    联系群众打掉官气　振作精神扫除暮气
    谦虚谨慎克服骄气　坚韧顽强反对娇气
    勤劳节俭反对阔气　严以责己消除怨气
    根据1958年的形势和党的任务，会议确定了1958年党的监察工作的任务：在中央和各级党委领导下，紧密地围绕整风运动和全力发展国民经济等党的中心任务，正确地检查处理各种违反党纪的案件。坚决彻底清除党内的右派分子，反革命分子，各种坏分子，严重违法乱纪分子，不可救药的腐化堕落分子，有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想和行为、屡教不改的分子。着重抓属于资本主义和社会主义两条道路斗争的案件，抓破坏党的团结和统一的案件，抓危害国民经济大跃进的案件，反对党内各种违法乱纪现象，纯洁和巩固党的组织，加强党的组织性纪律性，保证整风、反右派斗争的彻底胜利和国民经济的全面大跃进。
    会议对处理党员违反党的纪律的政策界限问题，进行了研究和讨论。
    会议认为，为了使党的监察工作适应全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设大跃进的新形势，保证党的政治任务和中心任务的实现，党的监察工作也需要来一个大跃进。出席会议的同志都一致认为，党的监察工作应该跃进，也是能够跃进的。会议要求全体党的监察干部必须千方百计，克服万难，鼓起干劲，勤学苦钻，争取监察工作的全面跃进。并且指出，争取监察工作大跃进，首先是加强政治思想领导，认清形势，克服右倾保守思想，打破常规，在思想上先来个大跃进。其次，在党委统一领导下，密切围绕党的政治任务，明确斗争目标，明确处理违反党的纪律案件的政策界限。第三，改进工作方法，克服经验主义。要求各级监委严格遵守党的统一领导的原则，认真执行集体领导和个人分工负责相结合的制度；做好全面规划，勤加检查；组织评比：比领导方法，比政治思想工作，比办案的质量和效率，比基层监察工作，比宣传教育工作；领导干部一年要有四个月或者更多的时间深入下层，抓典型，搞监察工作上的“试验田”，总结群众的创造。第四，党的监察干部要下苦功、挤时间学习马列主义，学习党的政策，学习毛主席的著作，学习唯物辩证法，密切联系实际，提高政治思想水平，提高识别能力。看问题要具有明确的阶级观点，要从全面出发，要有历史观点，要看问题的本质，切忌主观性、片面性和表面性。党的监察干部必须加强党性锻炼，一定要联系群众，打掉官气；振作精神鼓起干劲，扫除暮气；要谦虚谨慎，克服骄气；要坚韧顽强不怕困难，反对娇气；要勤劳节俭，反对阔气；要严以责己，消除怨气。要敢于向歪风邪气做斗争，为了坚持真理，要不怕“挨骂”，百折不挠地向党内各种违法乱纪现象、坏人坏事作斗争。党的监察干部要热爱自己的工作，忠于职守，当好促进派；必须对党绝对忠诚，大公无私，模范地遵守党的纪律，坚持监察者同样要受监察的原则，提高组织性、纪律性，虚心接受党组织和群众的监督，认真听取不同意见，反对特权思想。
    最后，会议认为，1958年各级党的监察组织的任务是繁重的艰巨的，也是十分光荣的。只要我们在中央和各级党委领导下，依靠群众，戒骄戒躁，鼓起革命干劲，千方百计地改进工作，就一定会胜利地完成党交给我们的任务。
