Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th – In the blossoming city of Nanning, more than 40,000 people of all ethnic groups, dressed in festive attire, braved the drizzle today to line the streets and welcome Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, other central representatives, representatives of various ethnic groups, and specially invited representatives, who came to congratulate the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Some of the representatives had arrived in Nanning earlier.

The Nanning Railway Station was filled with a festive atmosphere. The platform and corridors were decorated with a long row of colorful potted flowers, and huge red welcome banners were hung everywhere, with colorful flags fluttering. When the special train entered the station shortly after 10 o'clock in the morning, music and cheers rang out.

Vice Premier He Long and the representatives received flowers from a group of young people of all ethnic groups at the station.

A welcoming rally was held on the station square. As Vice Premier He Long and the representatives entered the venue, lusheng music played loudly, gongs and drums resounded, and tens of thousands of bouquets of flowers danced.

Wei Guoqing delivered a welcome speech. On behalf of the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee and the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, he extended a cordial and warm welcome to Vice Premier He Long and all the guests, and expressed heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council for their deep concern for the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. He said that we firmly believe that after the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi will continue to work together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, to accelerate socialist construction.

Vice Premier He Long spoke at the welcoming rally. He said: On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and Chairman Mao, I am here to congratulate the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Vice Premier He Long said that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is the long-cherished wish of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. The realization of this wish is a great happy event for the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, and also a great happy event for the people of all ethnic groups in the country. This is another great victory for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's brilliant ethnic policy.

Vice Premier He Long said that the Zhuang people and all ethnic groups within Guangxi are all hardworking, brave, and revolutionary-traditional ethnic groups in our country, and have jointly created the history of Guangxi for a long time. In the past hundred years, especially in the past thirty years, the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have further formed an unbreakable brotherly friendship in the common revolutionary struggle. This long-term history of common labor and common revolution is a guarantee for the close unity and common development of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi; today, it has important significance and role for the socialist construction cause of the motherland.

Vice Premier He Long's speech repeatedly aroused thunderous applause and cheers.

After the welcoming rally, Vice Premier He Long entered the city in an open-top car. The welcoming masses who had been waiting on both sides of the street cheered and applauded Vice Premier He Long with the greatest enthusiasm, waving flowers and releasing balloons of various colors. The shouts of "Long live the Communist Party of China," "Long live Chairman Mao," and "Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country" resounded throughout Nanning City.

The car was filled with thrown flowers, and Vice Premier He Long constantly waved to the crowd. Sometimes, he would transfer the bouquets to the children held by their mothers in the welcoming ranks. When the car passed through the ranks of workers, the cheers became even louder. Workers in two workshops of the Guangxi Biological Pharmaceutical Factory completed more than two days' worth of work yesterday in order to welcome the representatives of the Central Government today. Students from the Guangxi Nationalities Institute, including more than ten ethnic components, walked more than twenty li this morning to rush to Nanning to participate in the welcome.

Yesterday, Vice Premier He Long and representatives from various ethnic groups and regions were warmly welcomed by the local people in Liuzhou.

    百花盛开南宁市各族人民喜洋洋
    迎接广西僮族自治区成立
    四万多人夹道欢迎贺龙副总理
    据新华社南宁4日电　在百花盛开的南宁市，四万多盛装的各族人民今天冒着细雨，夹道欢迎前来祝贺广西僮族自治区成立的国务院副总理贺龙、中央的其他代表，以及各个民族代表和特邀代表。其中部分代表是提前到达南宁的。
    南宁火车站上，一片节日的景象。月台、走廊摆着一长列的鲜艳盆花，悬着巨幅红色的欢迎标语，到处彩旗飘动。当专车在上午十点多钟进入车站的时候，乐声和欢呼声响成了一片。
    贺龙副总理和代表们在车站上，接受了一群各民族青年的献花。
    欢迎大会在车站广场上举行。当贺龙副总理和代表们进入会场时，芦笙高奏，锣鼓齐鸣，万束鲜花舞动。
    韦国清致欢迎词。他代表广西省人民委员会和广西各族人民向贺龙副总理和所有的来宾表示亲切的热烈的欢迎，并向殷切关怀广西各族人民的党中央、毛主席和国务院表示衷心感谢和崇高的敬意。他说，我们坚决相信，广西僮族自治区成立以后，广西各族人民将继续在党中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，和全国各民族人民一道，为加速社会主义建设而共同努力。
    贺龙副总理在欢迎会上讲了话。他说：我代表中国共产党中央、国务院和毛主席，到这里来向广西各族人民庆贺广西僮族自治区的成立。贺龙副总理说，广西僮族自治区的建立是广西各民族人民多年来的愿望。这个愿望的实现，是广西各民族人民的一件大喜事，也是全国各民族人民的一件大喜事。这是共产党、毛主席光辉的民族政策又一次巨大的胜利。
    贺龙副总理说，僮族和广西境内的各民族，都是我国勤劳、勇敢并且富有革命传统的民族，很久以来，就共同创造了广西的历史。近百年来，特别是近三十年来，广西各族人民在共同的革命斗争中，更进一步地结成了牢不可破的兄弟友谊。这种长期的共同劳动，共同革命的历史传统，是广西各民族人民亲密团结、共同发展的保证；在今天，对于祖国的社会主义建设事业，更有重要的意义和作用。
    贺龙副总理的讲话，一再引起雷动的掌声和欢呼。
    欢迎大会结束以后，贺龙副总理乘敞篷汽车进入市区。久候在街道两旁的欢迎群众，用最大热情向贺龙副总理欢呼鼓掌，挥舞着鲜花，放出各种颜色的汽球。“中国共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”、“全国各民族人民大团结万岁”的欢呼声，响彻了南宁市。
    汽车里盛满了抛来的鲜花，贺龙副总理不断向群众挥手致意。有时，他把花束转送给欢迎行列里被母亲抱着的孩子。当汽车经过工人队伍行列时，欢呼声更加响亮。广西生物制药厂有两个车间的工人，为了今天来欢迎中央的代表，昨天一天完成了两天多的工作量。包括十多个民族成分的广西民族学院的学生，今天清晨步行了二十多里，赶到南宁来参加欢迎。
    昨天，贺龙副总理和各民族、各地区的代表，曾经在柳州受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。
