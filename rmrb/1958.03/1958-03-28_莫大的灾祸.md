    Enormous Disaster

    After the West German parliament passed a resolution to arm the West German army with atomic weapons, American officials immediately said that this was of "paramount interest" to Germany.

    Since it is of "paramount interest" to Germany, then the West German people should certainly support it with both hands! But the fact is not so. According to public opinion polls, 86% of West Germans oppose atomic armament.

    In fact, the reason is very simple. Arming West German troops with atomic weapons is only of "paramount interest" to the American aggressor bloc. Because they can serve as the atomic cannon fodder for the United States, acting as the vanguard for the United States. For the West German people, as many West German political leaders and newspapers have said, it will only lead to the destruction of the German people. It can be seen that the "paramount interest" in the mouths of American officials is actually an enormous disaster for the West German people.

    莫大的灾祸
    西德议会通过以原子武器武装西德军队的决议之后，美国官员就马上说，这是对德国有莫大利益的。
    既然是对德国有“莫大利益”，那么，西德人民总该举双手拥护了吧！但是事实却不然。据民意测验，西德有86％的人反对原子武装。
    其实道理也很简单。用原子武器把西德的部队武装起来，只是对美国侵略集团有“莫大利益”。因为它可以充当美国的原子炮灰，为美国打头阵。对于西德人民，那正像许多西德政治领袖和报纸所说的，只会使德国人民灭亡。由此可见，美国官员口中的“莫大利益”实际上就是西德人民的莫大的灾祸。
