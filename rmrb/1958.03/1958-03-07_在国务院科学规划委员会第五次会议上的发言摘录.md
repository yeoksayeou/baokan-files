Excerpt of Speeches at the Fifth Meeting of the State Council Science Planning Commission

    Really Red, Red All the Way Through
    Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    To achieve a leap forward in scientific research, the key is to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and organize everyone's strength in one direction. Our veteran scientists, the leaders of the scientific team, have a significant responsibility to mobilize and rely on the masses. But to do this, they must not only be determined to be red, but also truly red, red all the way through. They must burn away all remnants of bourgeois ideology, all kinds of arrogance, and selfish thoughts. Of course, since this is described as burning, burning with the fire of mass criticism and self-criticism, it won't be pleasant, and maybe one won't be able to sleep for several days. But we can think about it: if a person doesn't burn, doesn't transform, then objective reality is advancing like flying, and they will be left far behind; by that time, the broad masses of people are vividly running forward, and they become the garbage of a vibrant era. Although alive, they are actually dead.
    So it's better to burn. Let us throw ourselves into the fire, so that we can gain new life. With a new life, we can align our steps, and that will truly unleash our potential, under the leadership of the Party, with the support of advanced Soviet science, like a fissioned heavy atomic nucleus emitting incomparably great power. What is there that cannot be done? Completing and overfulfilling the long-range science plan, achieving a great leap forward in science is definitely achievable.

    We Must Develop "Experimental Plots"
        Li Da, President of Wuhan University
    We must go deep into reality, go into the laboratories, and develop "experimental plots." For those engaged in scientific research and teaching, there is nothing more terrible than being detached from reality. The old roots of all dogmatism, individualism, and conservative thinking lie in being detached from reality and detached from production. In the past, most people who taught and did scientific research didn't go into the laboratories. How could they teach students well and solve practical problems! In the past, this was a common practice, a prevailing trend, and everyone didn't think there was anything wrong with it. In fact, this is not a proletarian attitude towards learning. Personally, it is a manifestation of being unwilling to lower one's airs and fearing hardship. This attitude is fundamentally opposed to the requirements of scientific research because the task of scientific research is to explore the unknown, which itself requires hardship. This approach, in terms of the relationship between science and practical life, is also putting the cart before the horse because science comes from practice and serves practice. Today, we are all awakened. Under the call of the Party, many people have gone to the countryside and factories, determined to train themselves through physical labor; many people have gone into the laboratories and developed their own "experimental plots." This is a revolutionary and unprecedented pioneering undertaking in the history of China's intellectual and scientific circles, a great leap forward action. This has profound historical significance for the self-transformation of China's intellectual and scientific circles, for the development of China's culture, science, and education, and for promoting the combination of mental and physical labor, the combination of intellectuals and workers and peasants, and the combination of theory and practice. This is the only way for the self-transformation of the intellectual and scientific circles and the only way to develop China's science and culture. I suggest that everyone in China's scientific circles do this and learn from, compare with, and catch up with the advanced in this regard to examine our revolutionary drive.

    Small Laboratories Must Be Combined with Large Laboratories
            Qian Xinzhong, Vice Minister of Health
    Scientific research work must follow the mass line. Shanghai only completed 30% of its plan for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis last year, mainly because the scientists involved were working alone and conservatively, only doing research behind closed doors, and were unwilling to follow the mass line.
    Scientific workers in Nanjing saw in the literature that the three-day treatment method could be used to treat schistosomiasis. They started experimenting and succeeded. But the veteran scientists didn't believe it. They only believed in the 21-day treatment method that had been used for a long time. Even after more than a thousand patients had successfully used the three-day treatment method, some still didn't believe it. After countless facts proved it, the veteran scientists abandoned the 21-day treatment method and adopted the advanced three-day treatment method, which made the treatment of schistosomiasis take a leap forward.
    The above-mentioned three-day treatment method and 21-day treatment method both require daily injections, which require medical personnel to perform and cannot be carried out on a large and universal scale. Medical workers in Zhejiang Province changed the injections to "oral antimony agents," and the experimental results were very good. But the scientists in Shanghai didn't believe it and still thought injections were better. A scientist who strongly opposed "oral antimony agents" went to Zhejiang Province to see it. When he saw that the effect was indeed good, he brought the "oral antimony agents" to Shanghai for experimentation, but the result was a failure. Only because he firmly thought that "oral antimony agents" would cause vomiting in the stomach and the intestinal absorption would not be balanced. He treated the patients with this thought, which increased the patients' mental burden. One patient vomited, and other patients followed suit. Recent experiments have proved that the intestinal absorption of "oral antimony agents" is balanced and the efficacy can be confirmed. Now, after the dosage form has been improved, it is being promoted and applied. It will enable the plan to cure one million schistosomiasis patients this year to be broken through, and even three million people can be cured.
    This shows that scientific work should not only be carried out in the small laboratories of scientists, but also be combined with the large laboratories among the masses.

### 在国务院科学规划委员会第五次会议上的发言摘录

    在国务院科学规划委员会第五次会议上的发言摘录
    真的红　红得透
    中国科学院力学研究所所长　钱学森
    要科学研究工作能够跃进，归根还是要能发动群众，依靠群众，把大家的力量发挥出来，组织到一个方向。我们的老科学家们，也就是科学队伍里带队的人，他们的责任就很重大，要他们能够发动群众，依靠群众。但是要能这样做，不只是他们要决心红，更必须真的红，红得透。必须烧掉一切资产阶级思想的残余，各式各样的自高自大、自私自利的想头。当然，既然说明这是火烧，是以群众批评和自我批评的火来烧，烧起来不会好受，也许会好几天睡不着觉。但是我们可以想一想：如果一个人不烧，不改造，那么客观现实在飞一样地前进，他就远远地落在后面；到那时候，广大的人民群众是活生生地往前面跑，而他呢，他就成为有生气的时代的垃圾。虽然活着，而其实已经死去。
    所以还是烧一烧好。让我们投身入火，从而能取得新的生命。有了新生，我们才能把我们的步调一致起来，那就会真正地发挥出我们的潜力，在党的领导下，在苏联先进科学的支援下，就像裂变了的重原子核一样发出无比伟大的力量，哪里还有什么做不了的事。完成和超额完成科学远景规划，取得科学大跃进是肯定能做到的。
    我们必须搞“试验田”
        武汉大学校长　李　达
    我们必须深入实际，下实验室，搞“试验田”。搞科学研究和教书的人，再没有比脱离实际更可怕的了。一切的教条主义、个人主义和守旧思想的老根子，都在于脱离实际、脱离生产。过去教书和做科学研究的人，多半不下实验室，这样怎能教好学生、解决实际问题！过去这样做已经相沿成习，蔚为风气了，大家都不觉得有什么不好。实际上这不是无产阶级的治学态度，从个人说是放不下架子，怕艰苦的表现。这种态度和科学研究的要求，根本上是对立的，因为科学研究的任务是要探索未知，它本身就要艰苦。这种做法，从科学与实际生活的关系来说，也是本末倒置的；因为科学是来自实践而又服务于实践的。今天我们大家醒悟了，在党的号召之下，许多人下乡下厂了，决心从体力劳动中来锻炼自己；许多人下了实验室，搞了自己的“试验田”。这是我国知识界、科学界几千年来史无前例的革命创举，是一种大跃进的行动。这对我国知识界、科学界的自我改造，对于发展我国的文化科学和教育事业，对于促进脑力劳动与体力劳动结合、知识分子与工农结合、理论与实际结合等各方面，都有着深刻的历史意义。这是知识界、科学界自我改造的必由之路，是发展我国科学文化的必由之路。我建议我国的科学界人人都这样做，并且在这方面学先进、比先进、赶先进，来检查我们的革命干劲。
      小实验室要同大实验室结合
            卫生部副部长　钱信忠
    科学研究工作必须走群众路线。上海市去年防治血吸虫病的计划只完成30％，主要原因就是有关的科学家们单干保守，只关起门做研究，不肯走群众路线。
    南京的科学工作者们从文献上看到，治疗血吸虫病可以采取三日疗法，他们就动手试验并获得成功。但是老科学家们不相信，他们只相信沿用的二十一日疗法。已经有一千多个病人采用三日疗法成功，有的还不相信。经过无数的事实证明，现在老科学家们放弃了二十一日疗法，采用先进的三日疗法，使血吸虫病的治疗跃进了一步。
    上述三日疗法和二十一日疗法，每天要打针，还需要医务人员来执行，显然不能大量普遍地进行治疗。浙江省医务工作者把针剂改成“口服锑剂”，试验结果很好。可是上海的科学家们不相信，仍然认为打针好。一位极力反对“口服锑剂”的科学家到浙江省去看，看到效果的确好，就把“口服锑剂”带到上海试验，结果却失败了。只因为他牢固地想着“口服锑剂”到胃里会引起呕吐，肠内吸收也不平衡，他带着这种想法去处理病人，加重病人的精神负担，一个病人呕吐，影响别的病人也跟着吐起来。最近实验证明“口服锑剂”肠内吸收平衡，疗效可以肯定，现在经过剂型的改良，正推广应用，它将使今年治愈血吸虫病患者一百万人的计划可以突破，甚至可以治愈三百万人。
    这说明，科学工作除了在科学家们的小实验室进行以外，还应该同群众中的大实验室结合起来。
      （编者注：这些是发言的片断摘录，题目是编者加的。）
