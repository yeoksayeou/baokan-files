Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a conference on cultural and educational work, focusing on the discussion of issues such as universal elementary education, literacy campaigns, work-study programs, and being both "red and expert."

The conference considered that making every effort to quickly realize universal elementary education and eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people is an extremely important task for the cultural and educational front in Gansu Province. The current situation has created favorable conditions for the early realization of universal elementary education and literacy. First, after cooperativization, due to the full exertion of the collective labor force, a large number of school-age children have the possibility of being drawn out to study. Second, with economic development, the people have the strength to run schools themselves; coupled with the increasing urgency of people's demand for culture, this makes it possible for us to rely on the masses to rapidly popularize elementary education and mobilize the vast illiterate population to enroll in school. Wushan County, in the wave of this year's Great Leap Forward in agriculture, relied on the masses to establish seventy-four elementary schools in six days, completely realizing universal elementary education, and also mobilized more than 90% of the illiterate young and middle-aged people to enroll in school; Lintao County originally planned to complete universal elementary education this year, but completed it in less than a month in March, and now more than 95% of school-age children have enrolled in school. These vivid examples show that as long as the masses are fully mobilized, the task of basically popularizing elementary education and eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people within three years, as proposed by the Provincial Party Congress, can be completed ahead of schedule.

The conference also exchanged various experiences and specific measures related to work-study programs. The comrades participating in the meeting unanimously believed that implementing this policy not only has economic significance, as it can increase production and save a large amount of wealth for the country, but more importantly, it has political significance. All levels and types of schools must, without exception, widely carry out work-study activities according to their specific circumstances, to truly enable students to: be good students who love labor in school, and be laborers with socialist consciousness and culture after leaving school.

    甘肃召开文教工作会议
    讨论普及小学教育等问题
    本报特约新华社专稿　中共甘肃省委最近召开的文教工作会议，着重讨论了普及小学教育、扫盲、勤工俭学和又红又专等问题。
    会议认为：想尽一切办法，尽快实现普及小学教育和扫除青壮年文盲，是当前甘肃省文教战线十分重要的工作。目前形势已为尽快实现普及小学教育和扫盲创造了有利的条件。首先，合作化后由于充分发挥了集体劳动力量，大量的学龄儿童就有可能抽出来去学习。其次，随着经济发展，人民有力量来自己办学；加上人们对文化要求的日益迫切，这就使我们有可能依靠群众迅速普及小学教育，并动员广大文盲入学。武山县在今年农业大跃进的浪潮中，依靠群众，在六天内办起七十四所小学，完全实现了普及小学教育，同时还动员90％以上的青壮年文盲入学；临洮县原计划今年完成普及小学教育，在3月份不到一月的时间内就完成了，现在95％以上的学龄儿童都已入学。这些生动事例说明了只要充分发动群众，省党代会提出的三年基本普及小学教育和扫除青壮年文盲的任务是可以提前完成的。
    会议还交流了有关勤工俭学的各种经验和具体措施。与会同志一致认为贯彻这一方针，不仅有经济意义，可以为国家增产节约大量财富，更重要是它的政治意义。各级各类学校都必须毫无例外地根据自己的具体情况，广泛开展勤工俭学活动，真正使学生作到：在学校是热爱劳动的好学生，出校后是有社会主义觉悟和有文化的劳动者。
