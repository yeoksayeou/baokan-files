Grain Abundant in Every Household, Clothes Brand New for Everyone
A Brief Overview of Sandu Shui Autonomous County

Sandu Shui Autonomous County in Guizhou Province was established on January 2, 1957. It is located in the upper reaches of the Dujiang River in the eastern part of Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. It borders Rongjiang and Congjiang counties of Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture to the east, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to the southeast, Libo County to the south, Dushan County to the west, Duyun County to the northwest, and Danzhai County of Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture to the north. It covers an area of over 2,000 square kilometers and has a population of 162,933, including 97,926 Shui people, 27,221 Miao people, 23,509 Buyi people, 204 Yao people, 28 Dong people, 5 Zhuang people, and 14,040 Han people. The minority population totals 148,893, accounting for over 91% of the total population, with the Shui people accounting for over 60%. The autonomous county has jurisdiction over six districts, forty townships, and two towns. The People's Committee is stationed in Sandu Town.

The autonomous county is characterized by continuous mountain ranges and crisscrossing streams, with both high mountains and plains, as well as hills and valleys. Due to varying terrain, the climate is also diverse. Most areas of the county are around 700 meters above sea level, so the summers are not hot and the winters are not cold, allowing for two harvests of crops a year.

The Shui people are mainly engaged in agriculture, with some engaged in handicrafts.

The autonomous county is rich in rice and corn, and also produces cotton and green ramie. The mountains are covered with pine and fir trees, and there are still many virgin forests in remote areas. Local products are also quite abundant. The autonomous county is a major tung oil production area in Guizhou Province. According to statistics from four districts in 1956, it produced 1.1 million catties of tung oil. The autonomous county also has abundant mineral resources. Currently, iron, mercury, coal, phosphorus, antimony, lead, and zinc have been discovered. The iron ore deposit is currently the largest mining area in Guizhou Province, and coal is found almost everywhere. Zhoushan District also produces cinnabar.

Agriculture has developed significantly in recent years. After the establishment of advanced agricultural cooperatives in 1956, iron farm tools and advanced farming methods have been widely used in the past "slash-and-burn" hillside fields. The average yield of rice per mu is 400 catties, with the highest reaching 1,000 catties. In 1956, the total grain output increased by 50% compared to 1950. Rapeseed and wheat, which were not grown in the past, are now commonly planted. Due to continuous increases in production, people's living standards have greatly improved. The miserable life of the Shui people in the past, characterized by "bran and wild vegetables for half a year" and "sweeping the floor when the wind blows, using the moon as a lamp," has been replaced by the scene of "grain abundant in every household and everyone wearing new clothes."

The development of cultural and educational undertakings is also quite rapid. The number of primary school students has increased more than sevenfold compared to before liberation, and night schools have been set up in every village. Sanitary conditions have also improved. Hospitals, epidemic prevention agencies, and mobile medical teams have been established in the autonomous county, and 80% of the agricultural cooperatives have health clinics.

The development of transportation is also very rapid. Intersecting highways have connected Sandu with Duyun, the seat of the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, and Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province. The highway from Sandu to Libo is under construction, and the highway from Sandu to Rongjiang has been re-surveyed. This provides favorable conditions for the further development and prosperity of the autonomous county.

    三都水族自治县简况
    贵州省三都水族自治县于1957年1月2日成立，位于黔南布依族苗族自治州东部都江上游，东临黔东南苗族侗族自治州的榕江、从江两县，东南与广西僮族自治区接壤，南邻荔波县，西邻独山县，西北邻都匀县，北邻黔东南苗族侗族自治州的丹寨县。面积二千多平方公里，人口十六万二千九百三十三人，其中水族九万七千九百二十六人，苗族二万七千二百二十一人，布依族二万三千五百零九人，瑶族二百零四人，侗族二十八人，僮族五人，汉族一万四千零四十人。少数民族人口共十四万八千八百九十三人，占总人口91％强，水族占总人口60％强。自治县辖六个区四十个乡二个镇。人民委员会驻三都镇。
    自治县内山脉连绵，溪流交错，既有高山和平坝，也有丘陵和河谷。由于地势不同，气候也多种多样，全县大部分地区海拔七百公尺左右，因而夏季不热，冬季不冷，农作物能两种两收。
    水族主要从事农业，部分人从事手工业。
    自治县盛产稻谷、玉米，也产棉花、青麻。群山丛中到处都是松、杉，偏僻地方还有不少原始森林。土产也相当丰富，自治县是贵州省桐油主要产区，据1956年四个区的统计，出产桐油一百一十万斤。自治县内还蕴藏着丰富的矿产，目前已发现的有铁、水银、煤、磷、锑、铅、锌等。铁矿是目前贵州省最大的矿区，煤炭几乎遍地都有。周覃区还出产朱砂。
    几年来农业有很大的发展，在1956年高级农业合作化后，过去“刀耕火种”的山坡地，已普遍使用铁质农具和先进耕作方法，水稻产量平均每亩四百斤，最高的达一千斤。1956年粮食总产量比1950年增产50％，历史上没有种过油菜、小麦的地方，现在已普遍种植。由于连年增产，人民的生活已有很大的改善，水族人民以前那种“糠菜半年粮”，“风来风扫地，月来月作灯”，的悲惨生活已为“户户有余粮，人人穿新衣”的景象所代替。
    文化教育事业的发展也相当快。小学生比解放前增加了七倍多，每个村寨设有夜校。卫生条件也有改善，自治县内已建立了医院、防疫机构、巡回医疗组，80％的农业社已设有卫生室。
    交通事业的发展也是很快的，纵横的公路线已把三都同黔南布依族苗族自治州人民委员会驻地都匀及贵州的省会贵阳连接起来，从三都到荔波的公路正在施工，三都到榕江的公路已经复查，这为自治县的进一步发展和繁荣提供了有利的条件。
