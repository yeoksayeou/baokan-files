    Accomplishing One Hundred Yuan's Worth of Work with Eighty Yuan
    (This newspaper's report) The Chengdu Thermal Power Plant recently proposed to accomplish one hundred yuan's worth of work with eighty yuan, saving 6.5 million to 7 million yuan in the second phase expansion project investment. The investment per kilowatt of equipment will only be 940 yuan, a 22% reduction compared to the national average investment for thermal power plants.
    During the rectification campaign, in accordance with the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, this plant worked with the construction units to carefully review the budget of each project and made appropriate modifications to the original design. For example, the original design had an elevator on each side of the boiler, but they eliminated one. The original design used asbestos for the insulation of the plant buildings, but they changed to foamed concrete and diatomaceous earth as insulation materials based on local conditions, saving one million yuan on this item alone. They also reduced some auxiliary production and non-productive engineering projects, such as eliminating repair sections in each workshop and concentrating repairs in the plant's machine repair workshop, and so on. In addition, they also cancelled some excessively high welfare facilities and reduced the dormitory construction plan.

    八十元办一百元的事
    本报讯　成都热电厂最近提出要用八十元办一百元的事情，在第二期扩建工程投资内节省六百五十万元到七百万元。每瓩设备的投资只要九百四十元，比全国热电厂平均投资降低22％。
    这个厂在整风运动中，根据勤俭建国的方针，同施工单位一起认真审查了每项工程概算，并对原有设计作了适当修改。例如，原设计中在锅炉两旁各有一座电梯，他们取消了一座；原设计中厂房保温部分都用石棉，他们根据当地情况改用泡沫混凝土和矽藻土作保温材料，仅这一项就节约一百万元。他们还削减了一些辅助生产和非生产性的工程项目。如取消各车间的修理工段，集中在全厂的机修车间修理，等等。另外，还取消了一些过高的福利设施，削减了宿舍修建计划。
