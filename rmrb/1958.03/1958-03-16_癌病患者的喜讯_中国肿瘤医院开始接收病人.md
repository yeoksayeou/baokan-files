    Good News for Cancer Patients
    Chinese Tumor Hospital Begins Accepting Patients
    Xinhua News Agency, March 15th. The newly built Tumor Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences began accepting patients today. The Tumor Hospital will use atomic energy to treat tumor patients.
    Tumors are divided into two types: benign and malignant. Malignant tumors are called cancer. This is a disease that is very harmful to people and cannot be completely resolved by current medicine.
    The Tumor Hospital is a hospital that uses drugs, surgery, and radiation for comprehensive treatment, with equal emphasis on treatment and research. It has a radioactive Cobalt-60 therapy machine donated by the Soviet Union to our country and some other necessary equipment. The hospital has one hundred and fifty beds, and the outpatient department can see two hundred patients every day. In addition to radioactive cobalt, radium is also used in treatment. The directors and professors of various departments of Peking Union Medical College Hospital will often go there to provide guidance.
    The person in charge of the Tumor Hospital said: The hospital is newly established, and for the time being, patients will be transferred from Peking Union Medical College Hospital. After some experience has been gained, it can directly accept outpatient and inpatient patients.

    癌病患者的喜讯
    中国肿瘤医院开始接收病人
    新华社15日讯　中国医学科学院新建成的肿瘤医院，今天开始接受病人，肿瘤医院将应用原子能治疗肿瘤病人。
    肿瘤分良性、恶性两种，恶性的叫癌。这是一种对人危害较大、而目前医学不能完全解决的疾病。
    肿瘤医院是一个采用药物、手术和放射线综合治疗的医院，治疗、研究并重。它拥有苏联赠送给我国的放射性钴—60治疗机和其他一些必要的设备。医院有一百五十张病床，门诊部每天能看二百个病人。在治疗上除放射性钴以外，还应用镭。北京协和医院各科的主任教授将经常到那里去指导。
    肿瘤医院负责人说：医院初创，目前暂时先由北京协和医院转送病人，在摸索出一些经验以后，就可直接接受门诊和住院病人。
