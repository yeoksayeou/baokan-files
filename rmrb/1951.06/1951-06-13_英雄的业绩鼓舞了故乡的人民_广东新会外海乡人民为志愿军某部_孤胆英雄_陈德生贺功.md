　　The Hero's Achievements Inspire the People of His Hometown
　　——People of Waihai Township, Xinhui, Guangdong Celebrate the Merits of Chen Desheng, "Lone Hero" of a Certain Unit of the Volunteer Army

    The good news that Chen Desheng, a soldier of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, was awarded the title of "Lone Hero" spread to the hero's hometown—Waihai Township, Xinhui, Guangdong, and the 30,000 people of the township were as excited as a pot of boiling water. To express their admiration for their good son, the people of the township, in the midst of their busy spring plowing and flood prevention work, sent a congratulatory delegation of more than 200 representatives, who walked two hours to Chen Binglin, the hero's uncle's house in Shangwanli, Baisha Township, Jiangmen City, to express their congratulations. That day, the neighbors held a congratulatory meeting at the elementary school. At the meeting, the congratulatory delegation presented the good news and eight silk banners representing the true feelings of the 30,000 people of the township. The large characters on the banners shone dazzlingly in the sun: "Glorious Family," "Honor Belongs to Chen Desheng."
    Yes, honor belongs to Chen Desheng. However, our hero is very modest. In his letter home, he wrote: "I have rendered meritorious service to the people. This is the glory of the Communist Party and also the glory of the people of the motherland." All the people of China are proud that our country has such a hero. The people of the hero's hometown feel even more glorious and proud. In the "May Day" anti-American and aid-Korea grand demonstration held by the people of Jiangmen City in the rain, the residents copied the good news from Korea into large-character posters, drew pictures of Chen Desheng's heroic deeds, and hung up the silk banners sent by the farmers, crowding around Binglin and his wife, who were wearing corsages, and walking at the front of the team. As the team passed, thunderous applause and cheers resounded among the thousands of people in the urban area of Jiangmen!
    In the ranks of the demonstration against imperialism, Chen Binglin, the hero's uncle, said loudly: "Desheng is a good boy. There are many Chen Deshengs in China. If the American devils dare to come again, they won't be able to leave even one!"
    Yes, "Desheng is a good boy." Twenty-six years ago, he was born into a poor family in Qinglan Village, Waihai Township. His father worked as a tea house worker in Jiangmen City, twenty miles away from home. Because the work was heavy and the salary was low, he was overworked, developed a tumor, and died without money for treatment; his mother remarried. The lonely three-year-old Chen Qiusheng (Chen Desheng's former name) was taken in by his uncle Binglin to live with him. Like all working people in old China, Qiusheng suffered exploitation and oppression from an early age. His uncle was a poor peasant who cultivated a few mu of land for the landlord and could not even afford porridge after paying the high rent. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese devils invaded Xinhui. Chen Qiusheng, who was working in the fields, was drafted by the Japanese devils to Guangxi. But he never yielded. He escaped from under the bayonets of the Japanese invaders. When he returned to his hometown, he saw that the house had been demolished, and the fields could no longer be cultivated. So, he and his uncle Binglin wandered to Jiangmen. His uncle worked as a clerk and a worker, and Desheng himself sold newspapers. Chen Desheng, who came into contact with some new things from the newspapers, began to pursue the light. In 1947, he went to Shanghai. After that, Uncle Binglin rarely received letters from his nephew. On June 3rd last year, Desheng sent a letter, very short, only saying that he was now serving the people and living very well. Judging from the handwriting, Uncle Binglin said, "Desheng has made much more progress than before he left home."
    On April 25th this year, the good news from the Korean front arrived in the hero's hometown. That is: Chen Desheng joined the first company of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, rendered meritorious service on the Korean front, and was awarded the title of "Lone Hero." The good news sent by a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army said: "Comrade Chen Desheng, a soldier of the first company of our regiment, in the victorious attack in Xixingli, although he was wounded five times and lost command, was able to resolutely and independently destroy three enemy tanks and kill or wound four enemy drivers. He has now been awarded the glorious title of "Lone Hero" by the higher authorities. When the news came, the whole regiment was overjoyed..." The regimental leaders also jointly wrote a letter to the Waihai Township People's Government of the Fourth District of Xinhui to report the good news. The letter explained in more detail: the victorious attack in Xixingli was the most intense battle in the Hamhung campaign, and the three tanks destroyed by Comrade Chen Desheng belonged to the U.S. imperialist "ace army," the First Marine Division; regarding Comrade Chen's heroic deeds, the regimental leaders praised in the letter of good news: "It played a great role in this battle and cooperated with the brotherly troops to successfully complete the task of annihilating the enemy." Xinhua News Agency also sent a telegram from the Korean front, reporting in detail the glorious deeds of "Lone Hero" Chen Desheng, "Anti-Tank Hero" Ye Yong'an, and "People's Hero" martyr Kong Qingsan.
    In order to defend world peace and the cause of the people of the motherland, our hero Chen Desheng not only bravely fought the enemy on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea, but also was very concerned about the production situation in his hometown. At the beginning of his letter home written on March 16th, he encouraged the people of his hometown to work hard in production. Then, he wrote with full confidence: "I believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our production will definitely be successful. I hope you will work harder and strive to build a new China!" The workers and peasant brothers in the hero's hometown have not disappointed the hero's expectations. They have written letters to Chen Desheng, expressing the determination of the people of their hometown to support the Volunteer Army. The entire delegation of the Workers' Representatives Conference of the Fourth District of Xinhui, held in late April, wrote in a letter: "Everyone is standing on the front line of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend their homes and country. The workers in our entire district have signed a patriotic production pact to be the backing of the Volunteer Army and of you." The peasants of Qinglan Village are also collectively signing letters to Chen Desheng. When the congratulatory delegation returned, the village held a villagers' meeting with gongs and drums, and everyone shouted: "Learn from Brother Desheng!" In order to make the young people better recognize their banner, the Farmers' Association specially enlarged Chen Desheng's old photos and hung them in the Farmers' Association.
    Chen Yuyuan, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, who is the same age as Chen Desheng, said excitedly: I want to write a letter to Desheng. I want to say in the letter: The production in our hometown is doing very well. We have reclaimed nearly twenty mu of wasteland, dredged the hidden ditches, and mobilized hundreds of people to go to neighboring villages to help build water conservancy projects; we have recovered the rent grain from the landlords; the heinous local tyrant Chen Deyu has been executed by the People's Government; the three fish ponds he occupied have been returned to the peasants. Now, we are carrying out land reform. We hope that our hero will kill more American bandits on the front line and strive for more meritorious service.

　　英雄的业绩鼓舞了故乡的人民        
    ——广东新会外海乡人民为志愿军某部“孤胆英雄”陈德生贺功
    丁明
    中国人民志愿军某部战士陈德生荣获“孤胆英雄”称号的喜讯一传到英雄的家乡——广东新会外海乡，全乡三万人民兴奋得象一锅开水似的。为了表示对自己好子弟的敬仰，全乡人民在百忙的春耕防汛工作中，派了由二百多位代表组成的贺功团，步行两个钟头到江门市白沙乡上湾里英雄的叔父陈炳林家中贺喜。那天，街坊们在小学校里开了个贺功大会。在会上，贺功团把捷报和代表全乡三万人民真情的八面锦旗献上。旗上的大字在太阳下闪着眩目的光辉：“光荣人家”，“荣誉属于陈德生”。
    是的，荣誉属于陈德生。不过，我们的英雄是十分虚心的，他在家信里写道：“我为人民立了功，这是共产党的光荣，也是祖国人民的光荣。”全中国人民都为我们祖国有了这样的英雄而感到骄傲。英雄家乡的人民更感到光荣和骄傲。江门市人民冒雨举行的“五一”节抗美援朝大示威的队伍里，居民们把来自朝鲜的捷报抄成大字报，把陈德生的英雄事迹画成画，把农民送来的锦旗挂起，簇拥着戴起光荣花的炳林夫妇，走在队伍前头。队伍过处，在江门市区万千人民群众中，响起春雷似的掌声与欢呼声！
    在向帝国主义示威的行列里，英雄的叔父陈炳林响亮地说：“德生是个好孩子。中国的陈德生多得很，美国鬼敢再来，它就一个都不能剩！”
    是的，“德生是个好孩子”。二十六年前，他生在外海乡清栏村一个贫苦的家庭里，父亲在离乡二十里的江门市作茶楼工人，因为工作重，薪金少，操劳过度，生了肿病，无钱医治而死；母亲改嫁了。孤零零的三岁的陈秋盛（陈德生以前的名字），便由叔父炳林接过来同住。像旧中国所有的劳动人民一样，秋盛自小便受尽了剥削与压迫。他叔父是个贫农，耕地主几亩田，缴了高额地租后连粥也喝不饱。抗日战争时期，日本鬼子侵入了新会。做田工的陈秋盛，被鬼子拉伕拉到广西。但他绝不屈服，他从日寇的刺刀下逃回来了。回到家乡一看：屋，被拆掉了；田，自然耕不成了。于是，他和叔父炳林流浪到江门。叔父做了店员、工人，德生自己卖报纸。从报纸上接触到一些新东西的陈德生，开始了对光明的追求。一九四七年，他去了上海。此后，炳林叔便很少收到侄儿的来信。去年六月三日，德生有过信来，很短，只说他现在为人民服务，生活得很好。照字迹看，炳林叔父说：“德生比离家前进步多了。”
    今年四月二十五日，朝鲜前线的好消息来到英雄的家乡了。那便是：陈德生参加了人民志愿军某团一连，在朝鲜前线立了功，荣获“孤胆英雄”称号。志愿军某团寄来的捷报说：“我团一连战士陈德生同志在西兴里胜利出击中，虽身负五伤，并在失掉指挥的情况下，能果敢而独立自主地击毁敌人坦克车三辆，毙伤敌驾驶员四名，现已获上级授予的“孤胆英雄”的光荣称号。消息传来，全团莫不欢欣鼓舞……”团首长并联名写信给新会四区外海乡人民政府报喜。信里更详细地说明：西兴里胜利出击是咸兴战役最激烈的一场战斗，陈德生同志击毁的三辆坦克便是属于美帝国主义“王牌军”陆战一师的；对于陈同志的英雄业绩，团首长在报喜信里赞扬说：“对这次战役起了很大作用，配合了兄弟部队顺利完成歼敌任务”。新华社也从朝鲜前线发出电讯，详细地报道了“孤胆英雄”陈德生、“反坦克英雄”业永安和“人民英雄”孔庆三烈士的光辉业绩。
    为了保卫世界和平与保卫祖国人民的事业，我们的英雄陈德生不独在抗美援朝的最前线英勇杀敌，而且非常关心家乡的生产情况。他在三月十六日写回来的家信，一开头便鼓励家乡人民努力生产。跟着，他满怀信心地写着：“我相信在毛主席、共产党领导下，我们的生产是一定有成就的，希望加倍努力，为建设新中国而奋斗！”英雄的家乡里的工人、农民兄弟，没有辜负英雄的期望，他们纷纷写信给陈德生，表示家乡人民支援志愿军的决心。四月下旬举行的新会四区工人代表会议的全体代表，在信里写道：“大家一样都站在抗美援朝保家卫国的战线上，我们全区工人已订好了爱国生产公约，来做志愿军、做你的后盾”。清栏村的农民，也正在集体签名写信给陈德生。当贺功团回来时，村里便敲锣敲鼓开了个村民大会，大家都喊：“向德生哥看齐！”农民协会为了使青年们更好地认得他们的旗帜，特别把陈德生的旧照片放大，挂在农会。
    和陈德生同年的农会会长陈宇源激动地说：我要写信给德生了。我要在信里说：家乡的生产搞得很好，开了近二十亩荒地，疏好了阴渠，还动员了几百人到邻村去帮助兴修水利；我们向地主退得了租谷；罪大恶极的恶霸陈德宇已被人民政府枪决了；被他霸占的三口鱼塘，已交还农民。现在，我们正在进行土地改革，希望我们的英雄在前线多杀美国强盗，争取功上加功。
