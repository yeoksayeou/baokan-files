To the esteemed editor:

The leading cadres of the Jinan Locomotive Depot of the Jinan Railway Bureau are using an extremely egregious method of corporal punishment to deal with employees who make mistakes, which has aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the workers. The Jinan Railway Administration was completely unaware of this; after receiving feedback from workers, it did not deal with it in a timely manner.

The Jinan Locomotive Depot placed a wooden box in the depot's transportation section and made workers who had made mistakes sit on the box. A sign was hung on the wall behind the box, stating the worker's mistake. Every time the crew members of the depot went on duty, the duty officer would ask them to look at the punished workers to show a warning. The leading cadres of the depot called this method "introspection." Workers undergoing "introspection" had to sit on the wooden box day and night (except for eating, defecating, and urinating—but even that was restricted in time), and they were not allowed to sleep. Because the depot ordered them that they should not sleep if they made mistakes.

From May 12th to May 30th, they used this method to punish four workers, including Wang Enji (driver), Mi Fuchen (assistant driver), Sun Honglin (driver), and Liu Shifang (apprentice), and there were three people "preparing for introspection" who were not punished.

These four people sat on this wooden box for a long time. Wang Enji sat continuously for four days and four nights; Mi Fuchen became ill after sitting continuously for four days and four nights. After a doctor's examination, he took two days of sick leave, and then sat continuously for another four days and four nights; Liu Shifang sat continuously for six days and six nights; Sun Honglin sat continuously for five days and five nights. They couldn't even doze off while sitting there. To illustrate the severity of the situation, here is an example: When Liu Shifang was undergoing "introspection," because he couldn't bear it, he asked the leaders to send him to the public security section for "introspection." Many workers shed tears for them.

The trade union should represent the interests of the workers, but the trade union of their depot acted as the tail of the administration. It turned a blind eye to this matter and even wrote a "guarantee letter" for Sun Honglin, "guaranteeing" that Sun Honglin would not make mistakes again, and "begging" the administration to "release" him. At the same time, the Party and Youth League organizations of the depot did not oppose this wrong practice and never reported the situation to higher levels.

Now the higher-level trade union has sent several cadres to investigate this matter, but the administrative side still does not pay attention to it.
                                       Reader Yimin (written by the masses)

Editor's Note: The incident of arbitrarily inflicting corporal punishment on workers that occurred in the Jinan Locomotive Depot of the Jinan Railway Bureau is an extremely egregious act of illegally infringing on human rights and seriously insulting the personality of workers. It is an act of feudal oppression against workers. Who proposed this corporal punishment method and who approved it? The Jinan Railway Bureau should thoroughly investigate and clarify this matter, give them punishment, and order them to publicly apologize to the workers and admit their mistakes. At the same time, it is worth noting that the leading cadres of the Jinan Railway Bureau were completely unaware of such a serious, long-term, public insult and illegal corporal punishment of workers. After learning about it, they did not deal with it in a timely and serious manner. The local Communist Party organization, the trade union, and the Youth League organization turned a blind eye to this matter, did not raise objections, and did not report it to higher authorities. This shows the extent to which they are divorced from the masses and ideologically muddled. We suggest that the leading cadres of the Jinan Railway Bureau learn from this incident, organize cadres to discuss it, and strengthen the idea of relying on the working class.

### 济南铁路局济南机务段  竟侵犯人权体罚工人  对有关人员应给以严格处理

　　济南铁路局济南机务段       
    竟侵犯人权体罚工人       
    对有关人员应给以严格处理编辑同志：
    济南铁路局济南机务段领导干部使用一种极恶劣的体罚办法对付犯错误的职工，这事引起工人群众的极度不满。济南铁路管理局对这件事竟毫无所知；事后得到工人反映，也没有及时处理。
    济南机务段在该段运转股放了一个木箱，叫犯错误的工人坐在箱子上。在箱子后面墙上挂一个牌子，上面写明工人所犯的错误。该段每一班乘务员出乘，值班主任都要他们看被处分的工人，以示警戒。段的领导干部称这种办法叫“反省”。“反省”的工人黑夜白天都得坐在木箱上（吃饭，大、小便除外——但也限制时间），不得睡觉。因为段上命令他们，犯了错误就不应当睡。
    他们用这种办法从五月十二日到五月三十日，共处罚了王恩吉（司机）、米福臣（副司机）、孙鸿林（司机）、刘世芳（学徒工）等四个工友，还有三个“预备反省”的人没有处罚。
    这四个人在这木箱上坐的时间都很长。王恩吉连续坐了四天四夜；米福臣连续坐了四天四夜之后病了，经医生证明，请假休息了两天，以后又连续坐了四天四夜；刘世芳连续坐了六天六夜；孙鸿林连续坐了五天五夜。坐在上边连“盹”也不能打。严格的情况，可以举一个例子：刘世芳“反省”时，因为受不了，要求领导把他送到公安段去“反省”。曾有很多工人为他们这样而掉泪。
    工会应该是代表工人利益的，但他们段的工会却做了行政方面的尾巴，对于这件事，熟视无睹，并且替孙鸿林打“保证书”，“保证”孙鸿林不再犯错误，“求”行政上“释放”。同时该段的党和青年团的组织对这种错误作法不加反对，也始终没有向上级反映过这情况。
    现在上级工会派了几个干部来调查这件事，行政方面还是不重视。
                                       读者一民口述（群代笔）
    编者按：在济南铁路局济南机务段所发生的这种随便体罚工人的事件，是一种极端恶劣的非法侵犯人权、严重污辱工人人格的行为，是对工人的封建压迫行为。这种体罚办法是那些人提出和那些人准许这样作的，济南铁路局应该彻查清楚，给以处分，并令其向工人公开道歉，承认错误。同时，值得注意的是，对这样严重的长期公开的侮辱和非法体罚工人的事件，济南铁路局领导干部竟然毫无所知，事后知道了，也不及时认真处理；该段中共党组织、工会和青年团的组织，对此事竟也熟视无睹，不提出反对，不报告上级。这说明他们脱离群众和思想上糊涂到什么程度。我们建议济南铁路局领导干部很好地接受此事的教训，组织干部进行讨论，加强依靠工人阶级的思想。
