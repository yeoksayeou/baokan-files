    Section Two From Word to Sentence
    What is a sentence?
    Most grammar books say, "A sentence is something that has both a subject and a predicate." (The meanings of subject and predicate will be discussed later.) This definition is useful, but unfortunately, it's not comprehensive. On the one hand, some sentences don't have both of these parts; on the other hand, having both of these parts doesn't necessarily make something a sentence. Therefore, many grammar scholars have tried to find a more comprehensive definition for a sentence, such as, "A sentence is a relatively complete and independent unit of language." "Complete" refers to the meaning, and "independent" refers to the ability to stand alone when used, without needing anything added. For example, "That is the People's Daily" has a complete meaning and can be said alone to satisfy the listener. However, this completeness and independence are "relative," because only when answering someone's question, "What newspaper is that?" can "That is the People's Daily" be fully satisfying. If you say "That is the People's Daily" out of the blue, people will expect you to say more, such as "Do you want to read it?" or "It costs six hundred yuan per copy." In this situation, "That is the People's Daily" is not absolutely complete and independent. This kind of definition is much more comprehensive, but it also lacks practical value.
    Although it's difficult to define a sentence, it's not difficult to recognize what a sentence is from concrete examples. For us Chinese people, this understanding is very necessary, because the concept of a sentence has always been very vague in our language, and we often make mistakes in this area when we write. The "sentence" we usually talk about has a very general meaning. We say, "Come here, I want to say a sentence to you," but this sentence might take five minutes to say. The "sentence" here is much larger than a sentence in grammar. But we also say, "To learn and constantly practice it, isn't that a pleasure?" is two sentences, "Before my bed, the moon is bright, I suspect it is frost on the ground" is two sentences of poetry. The "sentence" here is much shorter than a sentence in grammar. This is reflected in our writing, where some sentences have incomplete structures, but the author has already punctuated them; or, more commonly, a hundred or eighty characters are written in one breath, and it's clear that they could be divided into several sentences, but the author only uses commas (,) to separate them. Therefore, clarifying the nature of sentences is very necessary for us.
    Simple Sentences, Compound Sentences, and Clauses.
    Let's start with the definition at the beginning of the previous section: "A sentence is something that has both a subject and a predicate." For example, "We must overcome difficulties" is a sentence. "We" is the subject, and "must overcome difficulties" is the predicate. Similarly, "We must learn things we don't understand" is also a sentence. So, "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we don't understand" Is this one sentence or two sentences? This is one sentence. This is a "compound sentence," which is pieced together from two simple sentences. We call the original two sentences "simple sentences" in terms of their internal structure. When they are parts of a compound sentence, we call them "clauses."
    Can all simple sentences be freely combined into compound sentences? No. It depends on whether their meanings are closely related. For example, "I am reading the People's Daily" and "You are reading the Guangming Daily" can be combined into one sentence, but they can't be combined with "He doesn't read any newspapers." They can be combined, but you have to change them slightly, for example, "You read the Guangming Daily, I read the People's Daily, but he doesn't read any newspapers." Readers can pay attention to compound sentences when reading books and newspapers every day and see if the clauses within them are closely related. Some sentences are very loose and can be divided into two or even three sentences.
    Sentence Forms.
    In the example sentence in the previous section, there are the four characters "things we don't understand" which can also be divided into a subject (we) and a predicate (don't understand). Does this count as a sentence? This doesn't count as a sentence, because it is contained within a sentence as a component of that sentence. It is different from a clause. A clause is semi-independent, but this is completely dependent. We call it a "sentence form," meaning it only has the form of a sentence, not the function of a sentence. A sentence that contains one or more sentence forms is still a simple sentence, not a compound sentence.
    "Things we don't understand" is an attributive of "things". Sentence forms can also be used as other components, such as "The Chinese people's liberation is a major event in world history," where "the Chinese people's liberation" is a sentence form. "We oppose US imperialism arming Japan" where "US imperialism arming Japan" are sentence forms. The former is used as a subject, and the latter is used as an object (discussed in the fourth paragraph).
    Between Words and Sentences - Words and Phrases.
    Sentences are accumulated from words, whether written on paper or spoken, there is no need to elaborate on this. However, people who talk about grammar pay little attention to the "word" itself, and instead talk about "terms". What is a term? What is the difference between a term and a word? Roughly speaking, a word is a unit of form and sound, and a term is a unit of meaning. A word may also be a unit of meaning, and that word is also a term; however, many terms are composed of two words, and some terms are composed of three or four words. We call the former monosyllabic terms, and the latter polysyllabic terms. For example, "人 (person)", "手 (hand)", "吃 (eat)", "喝 (drink)", each word has meaning, so they are all terms. These are monosyllabic terms. "言 (speech)", "语 (language)", "民 (people)", "义 (justice)" these, when spoken, are not clear in meaning and are only words, not terms. Only "言语 (speech)", "语言 (language)", "文言 (classical Chinese)", "口语 (spoken language)", "人民 (people)", "农民 (farmer)", "民主 (democracy)", "主义 (doctrine)", "意义 (meaning)" have clear meanings and are terms. These are polysyllabic terms. Two monosyllabic terms can also be combined into a polysyllabic term, just like two simple sentences are combined into a compound sentence; for example, "火车 (train)", "报纸 (newspaper)", "解放 (liberation)", "斗争 (struggle)".
    Thus, from a grammatical point of view, what constitutes a sentence is a term, not a word. Terms and sentences are two important units in grammar. However, when several terms are connected together, it is not necessarily a sentence, for example, "克服困难 (overcome difficulties)" and "词和句子 (terms and sentences)" etc. We call things that are more than one term but do not form a sentence "phrases". This is just a term in grammar, don't misunderstand it, thinking that phrases must be short. In fact, sometimes they can be much longer than a short sentence.
    Phrases can be divided into several types according to their internal structure. (1) Coordinate phrases: Their parts are equally linked, such as "词和句子 (terms and sentences)" and "完整而独立 (complete and independent)". (2) Attributive phrases: There is a main part and an added part, such as "我们的祖国 (our motherland)", "主要形式 (main form)", and "老老实实地学习 (study honestly)". (3) Verb-object phrases: A verb plus its object, such as "克服困难 (overcome difficulties)" and "保卫和平 (defend peace)". (4) Subject-predicate phrases: A subject plus a predicate, connected by the word "的 (de)", such as "中国的解放 (China's liberation)" and "态度的坦白 (frankness of attitude)".
    Among these four types of phrases, although the first two are also common, we don't often need to mention their names. The latter two phrases are often mentioned. In particular, the subject-predicate phrase is an unfamiliar name, and it needs to be explained a few sentences. The subject-predicate phrase is very similar in form to the attributive phrase, such as "中国的解放 (China's liberation)" and "中国的历史 (China's history)"; but in essence, it is equivalent to a sentence form, only with an extra "的 (de)" in the middle, for example, "庆祝中国的解放 (celebrate China's liberation)" and "庆祝中国解放 (celebrate China's liberation)" have exactly the same meaning. In the past, people interpreted the predicate part in this format as an abstract noun, which is inappropriate. One of the characteristics of a noun is that it is not modified by an adverb. However, we can say "中国的终于解放 (China's finally liberated)", and we can say "态度的不坦白 (the attitude is not frank)", "终于 (finally)" and "不 (not)" are both adverbs.
    Just as a sentence can contain sentence forms, a phrase can also contain phrases. For example, "学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法 (learn this method of dealing with the counter-revolutionary class's rule)" is a verb-object phrase; "这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法 (this method of dealing with the counter-revolutionary class's rule)" is an attributive phrase, including three attributives "这一项 (this)", "对待反革命阶级 (dealing with the counter-revolutionary class)", and "统治 (rule)"; "对待反革命阶级 (dealing with the counter-revolutionary class)" is also a verb-object phrase, in which "反革命阶级 (counter-revolutionary class)" is an attributive phrase. Not only that, but phrases can also contain sentence forms, for example, "自己不懂的东西 (things that you don't understand)" is an attributive phrase, including the sentence form "自己不懂 (you don't understand)".

            Section Three Parts of Speech
    Distinguishing Parts of Speech
    Distinguishing parts of speech is for the convenience of talking about grammar. But there is a prerequisite question: can Chinese words be classified? Some people say that a word may be used as a noun, a verb, an adjective, or a conjunction, and it is impossible to classify them at all. This statement is a bit of an exaggeration. It is a minority that Chinese words can be used as two or three types of words, and other languages ​​have similar situations. We want to affirm that Chinese words can be classified.
    How should Chinese words be classified? What should be used as the standard for classification? We won't discuss it in detail. On the one hand, there is no conclusion among grammar scholars, and a discussion will never end. On the other hand, although the distinction of parts of speech is a very important issue in grammatical theory, it is not the most important part of grammar in practice, far less important than sentence structure. But no matter how they are classified, it is best to follow a principle: the basic meaning of a word does not change, and the category to which it belongs does not change; in this way, the distinction of parts of speech makes sense. If it is said that everything attached to a noun is an adjective (such as "木头房子 (wooden house)" of "木头 (wood)", "活动房子 (mobile house)" of "活动 (mobile)"), everything placed after the word "的 (de)" is a noun (such as "中国的解放 (China's liberation)" of "解放 (liberation)", "态度的坦白 (frankness of attitude)" of "坦白 (frankness)"), anything that can be added with the word "了 (le)" is a verb (such as "人老了 (people are old)" of "老 (old)") - if such a view is adopted, then not only is the distinction of parts of speech not very meaningful, but it will naturally lead to the conclusion that "words have no fixed category".
    Eight Categories of Speech
    Let us temporarily divide Chinese words into eight categories.
    1. Nouns. No need to give examples. A small category is divided from this:
    Sub-nouns 个 (ge), 只 (zhi), 件 (jian), 尺 (chi), 斤 (jin), etc. Represents the unit of person or behavior. General nouns cannot be directly connected to numerals, and a sub-noun must be added in the middle.
    2. Verbs. No need to give examples. A small category is divided from this:
    Sub-verbs. 把 (ba), 被 (bei), 从 (cong), 往 (wang), 向 (xiang), 给 (gei), 对于 (duiyu), 由于 (youyu), 关于 (guanyu), 除了 (chule), etc. The characteristic of sub-verbs is that they cannot be the main component of the predicate, such as "我把报纸 (I the newspaper)" cannot form a sentence. Most sub-verbs used to be called "prepositions". Why do we abolish the category name "preposition"? Because according to the previous statement, "他在家养病 (He is recuperating at home)" of "在 (at)" is a preposition, "他在家 (He is at home)" of "在 (at)" is a verb, which is not in line with the principle of distinguishing parts of speech. Therefore, we include prepositions in verbs, and only separate those that cannot be the main component of the predicate into a small category, and call it a sub-verb. "于 (yu)" and "以 (yi)" inherited from classical Chinese are also included.
    3. Adjectives. The scope is broader than adjectives in some grammar books, including so-called "state adverbs". For example, "慢车 (slow train)" of "慢 (slow)" and "慢走 (walk slowly)" of "慢 (slow)" are both adjectives, and "慢慢地走 (walk slowly)" of "慢慢 (slowly)" is also an adjective, only used to describe a verb. In this way, adjectives will not be adjectives for a while, and then become adverbs for a while. Attached to this category of adjectives are:
    Numerals. 一 (one), 二 (two), 三 (three), 十 (ten), 百 (hundred), 千 (thousand), 万 (ten thousand), 半 (half), 几 (a few), 些 (some), 点 (a little), etc.
    4. Pronouns. 我 (I), 你 (you), 他 (he), 谁 (who), 什么 (what), 怎么 (how), 这 (this), 那 (that), 哪 (which), etc.
    5. Adverbs. The scope is smaller than adverbs in some grammar books, including only 先 (first), 再 (again), 又 (again), 也 (also), 还 (still), 就 (then), 很 (very), 不 (not), 常常 (often), 偶然 (occasionally), etc. These adverbs cannot be used as adjectives.
    6. Conjunctions. 和 (and), 跟 (with), 但是 (but), 因为 (because), 要是 (if), 除非 (unless), etc.
    7. Modal particles. 吗 (ma), 呢 (ne), 吧 (ba), 啊 (a), 啦 (la), etc.
    8. Onomatopoeic words. Includes "interjections" such as 啊 (a), 哟 (yo), 唉 (ai), "question and answer words" such as 噢 (oh), 嗯 (en), 嗄 (ga)? and the narrow sense of "onomatopoeic words" such as 砰 (bang), 乓 (pong), 哗啦 (whala). The characteristic of this type of word is that the writing is not very fixed.
    Among these eight types of words, the meanings of nouns, verbs, and adjectives are relatively solid and can be called "content words"; the meanings of pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, and modal particles are relatively ethereal and can be called "function words", which is roughly the same as the scope of the previous so-called "empty words". Sub-nouns, sub-verbs, and some numerals can also be classified as function words. In the entire vocabulary, content words account for the absolute majority; but although the number of function words is small, they are much more important grammatically than content words.
    Suffixes. There are two types of characters that do not become words. One type is "言 (speech)", "语 (language)", "民 (people)", "义 (justice)" and these are the main components of content words. The other type, like "子 (zi)" (桌子 (table), 椅子 (chair)), "头 (tou)" (木头 (wood), 石头 (stone)), "们 (men)" (我们 (we), 孩子们 (children)), "么 (me)" (这么 (so), 那么 (then)), "着 (zhe)" (看着 (looking), 写着 (writing)), these are neither independent words, nor are they the main components of content words, but are only attached to the end of content words, like a tail, so we call them "suffixes". The function of suffixes is similar to that of function words, but because they are not independent, they cannot be classified as function words, but "empty words" can include them.
    "呢 (ne)", "吗 (ma)", "吧 (ba)", "啦 (la)" these characters cannot be independent either, but they are not attached to the end of words, but attached to the end of sentences (or parts of sentences), so we can only still count them as words. Suffixes were originally words, and now there are two words that are transforming, but not completely. One is "了 (le)", which was originally a modal particle (吃饭了 (have eaten)), and later differentiated into a verb suffix (吃了饭了 (have eaten)). But sometimes a word can be inserted between the verb and "了 (le)" (吃好了饭了 (have eaten well)), which shows that its suffix nature is not complete. The other is "的 (de)", which was originally a conjunction, but in "我的 (mine)", "红的 (red one)", "慢慢的 (slowly)" it can, and should, be counted as a suffix (especially when there are no other words after it, such as "这是我的 (this is mine)", "这是红的 (this is red)", "慢慢的! (slowly!)"). But in "我看的报 (the newspaper I read)", "的 (de)" is still a conjunction. Now it is very common to write "慢慢的 (slowly)" as "慢慢地 (slowly)", and it is also common to write "我的 (mine)" as "我底 (mine)", and there is no problem that "地 (de)" and "底 (di)" are suffixes. There is also the character "儿 (er)", which is even more special, it has no longer become an independent syllable and is often not written out. When written out, it is naturally also a suffix.

　　语法、修辞讲话
    吕叔湘　朱德熙
    第二段  从字到句
    句子是什么。
    一般语法书上说，“具备主语和谓语这两个部分的是句子。”（主语和谓语的意义底下再讲。）这个定义很有用，可惜不周密。一方面，有些句子并不具备这两个部分；另一方面，具备这两个部分的也不一定都是句子。因此，好些语法学者想法给句子找个周密的定义，比如说，“句子是相对地完整而独立的语言单位”。“完整”是指意思方面，“独立”是指运用的时候能单独站住，不必添什么。例如“那是人民日报，”意思完整了，也能单独说出去，使对方满足。可是这完整和独立是“相对地”，因为只有回答人家的问话“那是什么报？”的时候，“那是人民日报”才能叫人完全满足。要是你凭空来个“那是人民日报”，人家是估料你还有下文的，比如“你要看不要？”或是“六百元一份”之类。在这个情况之下，“那是人民日报”就不是绝对地完整而独立了。这种定义，周密是周密得多，可是又没有多大实用价值。
    句子的定义虽然很难下，句子是怎么个东西是不难从具体的例子认识的。对于我们中国人，这个认识是非常需要的，因为在我们的语言里，句子这个概念一向很模糊，我们写文章的时候也往往就在这个上面出毛病。我们平常说的“句”，意思很笼统。我们说，“你过来，我跟你说句话，”结果这句话可能说上五分钟，这里的“句”比语法里的句子大得多。可是我们又说“学而时习之，不亦悦乎？”是两句书，“床前明月光，疑是地上霜”是两句诗，这里的“句”又比语法里的句子短得多。表现在我们的文章上，好些句子的结构还不完全，可是作者已经圈断了；或是，更常见，一口气写下百儿八十个字，明明可以分成几个句子，可是作者一直都只用逗号（，）隔开。所以，把句子的性质弄清楚，对于我们是十分需要的。
    简单句、复合句、分句。
    让我们还从上一节头上的定义出发，“具备主语和谓语这两个部分的是句子。”例如“我们必须克服困难，”这是一个句子，“我们”是主语，“必须克服困难”是谓语。同样，“我们必须学会自己不懂的东西，”这也是一个句子。那么“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”这是一个句子还是两个句子呢？这是一个句子。这是一个“复合句”，是由两个简单的句子拚起来的。原先那两个句子，就它们的内部构造说，我们管它叫“简单句”；就它们作为复合句的部分说，我们管它叫“分句”。
    是不是所有的简单句都能随意拚凑成复合句呢？不成。要看它们的意思是不是密切关联。比如“我看的是人民日报”，跟“你看的是光明日报”可以合成一句，跟“他是不看报的”就怎么也合不到一块儿。要合也成，得稍微改动一下，比如说，“你看光明日报，我看人民日报，他却什么报也不看。”读者可以在每天看书看报的时候注意那些复合句，看它们里头的分句是不是密切关联。有些句子是很松散的，是可以分成两句甚至三句的。
    句子形式。
    在上一节的例句里有“自己不懂”四个字，也能分成主语（自己）和谓语（不懂）两部分，这算是句子不算呢？这不算是句子，因为它被包含在一个句子里头，作为那个句子的一个成分。它跟分句不同，分句是半独立的，它是完全不独立的。我们管它叫“句子形式”，意思是它只有句子的形式，没有句子的作用。一个句子里头包含一个或几个句子形式，还是一个简单句，不算复合句。
    “自己不懂”是“东西”的附加语。句子形式还能做别的成分，如“中国人民获得解放是世界历史上一件大事情”里的“中国人民获得解放”，“我们反对美帝武装日本”里的“美帝武装日本”都是句子形式，前者是做主语用的，后者是做宾语用的（第四段里讲）。
    字和句之间——词、短语。
    句子是字积累起来的，写在纸上是这样，说在嘴里也是这样，这都不用细说。可是讲语法的人不大理会“字”这个东西，要讲“词”。词是什么呢？跟字有什么分别呢？粗疏一点说，字是形体和声音的单位，词是意义的单位。一个字可能也是意义的单位，那个字就同时是一个词；但是许多词是两个字合成的，有些词是三个或四个字合成的。前者我们管它叫单音词，后者我们管它叫多音词。如“人”“手”“吃”“喝”，每个字都是有意义的，所以都是词。这是单音词。“言”“语”“民”“义”这些个，说在嘴里，听在耳朵里，意义都不明确，都只是字，不是词；只有“言语”“语言”“文言”“口语”“人民”“农民”“民主”“主义”“意义”这些才有明确的意义，才是词。这是多音词。两个单音词也能合成一个多音词，跟两个简单句合成一个复合句一样；例如“火车”“报纸”“解放”“斗争”。
    这样，从语法讲，构成句子的是词，不是字。词和句子是语法上的两个重要单位。可是好几个词连在一块的时候，不一定就是句子，例如“克服困难”“词和句子”等等。这些不止一个词可又不成为一个句子的东西，我们管它叫“短语”。这只是语法上的一个术语，千万别误会，以为短语一定都是短的，事实上有时候可以比一个短句子长得多。
    短语可以依照它内部结构分成好几个类型。（一）联合短语：它的部分是平等相联的，如“词和句子”“完整而独立”。（二）主从短语：里面有一个部分是主体，另一个部分是附加的，如“我们的祖国”“主要形式”“老老实实地学习”。（三）动宾短语：一个动词加上它的宾语，如“克服困难”“保卫和平”。（四）主谓短语：一个主语加上一个谓语，中间用“的”字连接，如“中国的解放”“态度的坦白”。
    这四种短语之中，前两种虽然也常见，我们没有常常说到它们的名字的需要。后两种短语是要常常提到的。尤其主谓短语是个生疏的名字，要说明几句。主谓短语在形式上跟主从短语很相像，如“中国的解放”和“中国的历史”；但是实质上等于一个句子形式，只是当中多了个“的”字，比如“庆祝中国的解放”，跟“庆祝中国解放”的意思是完全一样的。从前人把这种格式里的谓语部分解释为抽象名词，这是不妥当的。名词的特征之一就是不受副词的修饰。可是我们能说“中国的终于解放”，能说“态度的不坦白”，“终于”和“不”都是副词。
    正如句子里头可以包含句子形式，短语里头也可以包含短语。例如“学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法”，这是一个动宾短语；“这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法”是一个主从短语，里面包括“这一项”“对待反革命阶级”“统治”三个附加语；“对待反革命阶级”又是一个动宾短语，那里面的“反革命阶级”又是一个主从短语。不但这样，短语里面还可以包含句子形式，例如“自己不懂的东西”就是一个主从短语，里面包含“自己不懂”这个句子形式。
            第三段  词类
    区分词类。
    区分词类，是为的讲语法的方便。可是有一个先决问题：汉语的词能分类吗？有人说，一个词可能一会儿做名词用，一会儿做动词用，一会儿做形容词用，一会儿做连接词用，根本不能分类。这个话有点过甚其辞。汉语里的词能做两类或三类词用的究竟是少数，别种语言也有类似的情形。我们要肯定汉语的词能分类。
    汉语的词应该怎么分类呢？拿什么做分类的标准呢？我们不详细讨论。一则语法学者中间还没有定论，一讨论就会没结没完。二则词类区分虽然在语法理论上是很重要的问题，在实用上并不是语法的最重要的部分，远不及句子结构的重要。可是无论怎么分类，最好能服从一个原则：词的基本意义不变，所属的类也不变；这样，词类的分别才有意思。如果说，附加在名词上头的都是形容词（如“木头房子”的“木头”，“活动房子”的“活动”），放在“的”字后头的都是名词（如“中国的解放”的“解放”，“态度的坦白”的“坦白”），可以加“了”字的都是动词（如“人老了”的“老”）——如果采取这样的看法，那就不但词类的区分没有多大意思，而且自然而然会走向“词无定类”的结论。
    词分八类。
    我们暂且把汉语的词分成八类。
    一、名词。  不必举例。这里面又分出一小类：
    副名词  个、只、件、尺、斤，等等。表示人物或行为的单位。一般名词不能直接和数词相连，当中必须加个副名词。
    二、动词。  不必举例。这里面又分出一小类：
    副动词。  把、被、从、往、向、给、对于、由于、关于、除了，等等。副动词的特征是不能做谓语的主要成分，如“我把报纸”是不能成句子的。大多数副动词从前叫做“介词”。我们为什么取消“介词”这个类名呢？因为照从前的说法，“他在家养病”的“在”是介词，“他在家”的“在”是动词，这是不合于词类区分的原则的。所以我们把介词归并在动词里，只把其中不能做谓语的主要成分的分出来做一小类，叫它副动词，从文言里继承过来的“于”和“以”也包括在内。
    三、形容词。  范围比有些语法书里的形容词广些，包括所谓“状态副词”。例如“慢车”的“慢”和“慢走”的“慢”都是形容词，“慢慢地走”的“慢慢”也是形容词，只是用来形容动词罢了。这样，形容词就不会一会儿是形容词，一会儿又变成副词。附属在形容词这一类的是：
    数词。  一、二、三、十、百、千、万、半、几、些、点，等等。
    四、代词。  我、你、他、谁、什么、怎么、这、那、哪，等等。
    五、副词。  比有些语法书里的副词范围小，只包括先、再、又、也、还、就、很、不、常常、偶然，等等。这些副词是不能作形容词的。
    六、连接词。  和、跟、但是、因为、要是、除非，等等。
    七、语气词。  吗、呢、吧、啊、啦，等等。
    八、象声词。  包括“叹词”如啊、哟、唉，“问答词”如噢、嗯、嗄？和狭义的“象声词”如砰、乓、哗啦。这类词的特点是写法不很固定。
    这八类词里面，名词、动词、形容词的意义比较实在些，可以称为“实词”；代词、副词、连接词、语气词的意义比较空灵些，可以称为“虚词”，和从前所谓“虚字”的范围大致相同。副名词、副动词、一部分数词，也可以归在虚词里。在整个的词汇里，实词占绝对多数；但是虚词的数目虽然小，在语法上可比实词重要得多。
    词尾。  不成为词的字有两类。一类就是“言”“语”“民”“义”这些，是组成实词的主要成分。另外一类，像“子”（桌子、椅子），“头”（木头、石头），“们”（我们、孩子们），“么”（这么、那么），“着”（看着、写着）这些，既不是独立的词，又不是实词的主要成分，只是附著在实词后头，像个尾巴似的，我们就管它叫“词尾”。词尾的作用跟虚词差不多，不过因为它不独立，不能归在虚词里，可是“虚字”是可以把它们包括进去的。
    “呢”“吗”“吧”“啦”这些字也是不能独立的，可是它们不是附著在词的后头，而是附著在句子（或句子的部分）后头，因此我们只能还把它们算做词。词尾本来是词变成的，现在还有两个词正在转变之中，还没变完全。一个是“了”，原来是个语气词（吃饭了），后来又分化出一个动词词尾来（吃了饭了）但是动词和“了”之间有时候能插进一个词（吃好了饭了），可见它的词尾的性质还不完全。另一个是“的”，原来是个连接词，但是在“我的”“红的”“慢慢的”里头可以，也须应该，算词尾（尤其是在后面不跟别的词的时候，如“这是我的”“这是红的”“慢慢的！”）。但是在“我看的报”里面，“的”还是一个连接词。现在把“慢慢的”写成“慢慢地”已经很普通，把“我的”写做“我底”的也很多，这个“地”和“底”不成问题是词尾。还有一个“儿”字，又特别些，它已经不成为一个独立的音缀，常常不写出来。写出来的时候，自然也是个词尾。
                                   （本段完，全文未完）
