	Conscientiously Fulfill Patriotic Pledges
    Yantai Business Community Actively Pays Taxes
	Issues Three Basic Demands to Challenge Business Communities Across the Country

Editor:
	The Yantai City business community in Shandong Province is working hard to practice its five patriotic pledges and actively participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. They have shown significant progress and achievements in taxation. On March 23rd of this year, after all 65 industries in the city voluntarily paid all of their 1950 income taxes, they continued to pay the 1951 business tax. The business tax for April 1951 was originally scheduled for collective payment on May 5th. In order to complete the task one day ahead of schedule, all industries completed payment within six hours on May 4th. At 10:00 a.m. on May 5th, the city's business community held a collective tax payment parade, with more than 3,350 businesses participating. The tax-paying businesses were very excited during the parade, shouting slogans along the way such as "Paying taxes early is glorious!" and "Tax evasion and arrears are shameful!" Encouraged by this patriotic tax-paying enthusiasm, the city's business community decided to pay all income taxes due from January to March 1951 by May 7th; many industries guaranteed that all income taxes for the first half of 1951 would be paid by May 15th.

	The city's Federation of Industry and Commerce has issued a letter of challenge to Federations of Industry and Commerce across the country, putting forward three basic requirements related to taxation: 1. Guarantee that all business taxes for the previous month are paid into the treasury by the 4th of each month; 2. Demand that the reported amounts are accurate and the assessed amounts are correct; 3. Transform collective tax payment into a regular action.

　　切实履行爱国公约
    烟台工商界踊跃缴税
   提出三项基本要求向各地工商界挑战编辑同志：
    山东烟台市工商界努力实践自己的五项爱国公约，积极参加抗美援朝运动。他们在纳税方面表现了显著的进步和成绩。今年三月二十三日，全市六十五行业，自动把一九五○年全年的所得税税款全部入库后，即继续缴纳一九五一年应缴纳的营业税。一九五一年四月份的营业税，原订五月五日集体缴纳，各行业为了争取提前一日完成任务，结果在五月四日六个小时内便全部缴清。五月五日上午十时，全市工商界举行集体纳税的游行，参加游行者共有三千三百五十多户。各纳税厂商在游行当中都非常兴奋，沿途高呼：“提前缴税是光荣的！”“偷税拖欠是可耻的！”等口号。全市工商界在这样爱国纳税热情鼓舞之下，又决定要在五月七日将一九五一年一月到三月份应纳所得税税款全部缴齐；内中并有大部分行业保证将一九五一年上半年的所得税税款于五月十五日前全部入库。
    该市工商业联合会现已向各地工商业联合会发出挑战书，提出了三项有关纳税的基本要求，即：一、每月四日前保证将上月营业税款全数入库；二、要求做到报的实在评的正确；三、要将集体纳税变成经常性的行动。
