How Ninh Binh City Was Captured

Ninh Binh Province is located in the northern part of Vietnam, 70 kilometers south of Hanoi, on the right bank of the Red River Delta. The remaining veins of the Truong Son mountain range pass through here, extending to the coast with the rich plains containing cities such as An Mo, Minh Cam, Kim Son, and Phat Diem. Ninh Binh City is a transportation hub where the Hanoi-Saigon railway passes through, and the No. 1 highway from Lang Son to Thanh Hoa and the highway to Nam Dinh connect. The Day River and the Nhut River also converge here.

Near Ninh Binh City, three mountains, Dieu Mountain, Hac Tat Mountain, and Son Thuy Tu Mountain, overlook the confluence of the Day River and the Nhut River.

At the end of 1949, the French invading army occupied Ninh Binh City. At that time, they massacred residents in large numbers, raped women, and also violated religion, occupied churches and the Son Thuy Tu pagoda tower, and converted them into bunkers. These brutal acts of the French army aroused the hatred of all residents.

Since then, Ninh Binh City has become a ghost world, with some French bandits and a gang of Vietnamese traitors entrenched here, trying to dig in and hold on.

The French troops stationed in Ninh Binh City were approximately a company of French naval infantry. Their mission was to conduct reconnaissance patrols along the river and the coast, and to carry out lightning attacks on the liberated areas. Therefore, most of the officers and soldiers of the French garrison in Ninh Binh were French, and they were fully equipped with machine guns, automatic rifles, and carbines. The French commanders included Captain Labrousse and three other lieutenants, Gowerly, Bote, and G. Willy.

The French stronghold on Son Thuy Tu Mountain was very strong, surrounded by 80 mm thick walls and several rows of barbed wire. Guarding this stronghold was the 88th Company of the French Army.

At dawn on May 29th, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive against Ninh Binh City. At the very beginning of the battle, the artillery and mortars of the Vietnamese People's Army surprised the enemy. The sudden attack immediately caused chaos among the French soldiers, who failed to offer any resistance. Captain Labrousse fled after the first shell fired by the People's Army exploded. He abandoned many documents, including his diary, which talked about his visits to his superiors Tassigny (Commander-in-Chief of the French invading army in Vietnam) and Ortolli (Commander of the French Navy in Vietnam), and also revealed his growing dissatisfaction with his superiors.

The Vietnamese People's Army broke into the city seven minutes after the attack began. Lieutenant Gowerly was captured. Terrified French soldiers fled in all directions but were captured. The entire battle lasted 28 minutes.

According to Lieutenant Gowerly, who was captured the day after the battle: "The attack of the Vietnamese People's Army was irresistible. We were caught like rats in a cage."

At 9:00 a.m. on May 29th, French reinforcements of approximately one battalion arrived, including one infantry company and two armored companies, landing near Son Thuy Tu Mountain along the Day River on two naval vessels and several other boats to attack south, but they were immediately intercepted by the Vietnamese People's Army. At noon, after losing a platoon of troops, the enemy rushed to Dieu Mountain and was immediately surrounded. The battle lasted until 5:00 p.m., and the enemy lost another 40 men. They broke through the encirclement and retreated to Hac Tat Mountain and Son Thuy Tu. In this way, the defense forces in the two places were strengthened by about one to two companies respectively. Among the defenders of Son Thuy Tu was De La Tu, the only son of Tassigny. At dawn on May 30th, the Vietnamese People's Army artillery fired in support of the infantry's attack on the enemy's strongly fortified strongholds. Most of an enemy armored company was annihilated (including De La Tu), and those who were not killed surrendered to the People's Army. The second attack met with strong resistance from the enemy troops hiding in bunkers. But soon, the People's Army artillery leveled them. At 5:00 a.m., the Vietnamese People's Army completely controlled Ninh Binh City.

### 宁平城是怎样攻克的？

　　宁平城是怎样攻克的？
    宁平省在越南北部河内以南七十公里红河右岸的三角洲上，长山山脉的余脉从这里经过有着安模、敏堪、金山和发艳等城市的富庶的平原，一直延伸到海岸。宁平城是一个交通要道口，河内至西贡的铁路通过这里，谅山至清化的第一号公路和通向南定的公路在这里衔接，带河和鹬河也在这里合流。
    在宁平城附近，有鹞山、鹤膝山和山水寺山三座山俯瞰着带河鹬河的合流处。
    一九四九年底，法国侵略军占领了宁平城。当时他们大批屠杀居民，强奸妇女，而且还侵犯宗教，占领教堂和山水寺高塔，并将他们改建成碉堡。法军这些残暴行为激起了全体居民的憎恨。
    自此以后，宁平城就成为一个鬼蜮世界，一些法国匪徒和一帮越奸盘据在这里，妄图掘壕固守。
    在宁平城内驻守的法军是法国海军陆战队约一个连。法军任务为沿河及沿海侦察巡逻，向解放区进行闪击战。因此，宁平法国守军官兵大多为法国人，装备全是机关枪、自动步枪和卡宾枪。法军指挥官包括上尉拉布鲁斯及其他三个尉官高威里、鲍特和加·威里。
    法军在山水寺山的据点是很坚强的，它周围筑有八十公厘厚的围墙和几道铁丝网。守卫这个据点的是法国陆军第八十八连。
    五月二十九日黎明，越南人民军向宁平城发动了攻势。在战斗刚一开始时，越南人民军的大炮和臼炮就使敌人大吃一惊。突然开始的攻击立刻在法国士兵中引起混乱，他们未能从事任何抵抗。上尉拉布鲁斯在人民军射出的第一发炮弹爆炸后就逃走了，他遗弃了许多文件，其中有他的一本日记，谈到他晋谒他的上司塔西尼（法国侵越军总司令）和奥尔托里（法国侵越军海军司令）的经过，还透露他对他的上司们日益不满的情绪。
    越南人民军于攻击开始后七分钟突入城内。高威里中尉就擒。心惊胆战的法国士兵四散逃命，但均被俘获。解决战斗共用时间二十八分钟。
    据被俘的高威里中尉于战斗次日说：“越南人民军的攻击是难以抵抗的。我们像笼子里的老鼠一样被逮住了。”
    五月二十九日上午九时，法军增援部队约一个营来了，其中有一个步兵连，二个装甲连，分乘海军舰只二艘及其他船只数艘沿带河在山水寺山附近登陆向南进攻，但他们立即遭到了越南人民军的截击。正午，敌人于损失一个排的兵力后，冲至鹞山，又立即被包围。战斗至下午五时，敌人又损失四十名，他们突破包围又退至鹤膝山和山水寺。这样，上两处的防守兵力分别增强了约一个到两个连。山水寺守军里有塔西尼的独子德拉都。五月三十日黎明，越南人民军炮兵发炮支援步兵攻击敌人坚强设防的两个据点。敌人一个装甲连大部被歼灭（德拉部也在内），未被打死的向人民军投诚。第二次攻击遭到藏在碉堡中的敌军坚强的抵抗。但不久，人民军炮兵即将它们削平。晨五时，越南人民军完全控制了宁平城。
