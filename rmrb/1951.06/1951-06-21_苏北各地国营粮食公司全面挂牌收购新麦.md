State-owned grain companies in Northern Jiangsu are comprehensively posting prices in various locations to purchase new wheat

New wheat has generally entered the market in the Northern Jiangsu region. The Northern Jiangsu branch of the China Grain Company, following instructions from higher-level companies, and in accordance with the new wheat production and sales situation in various locations, formulated reasonable purchase prices and notified its branches in various locations to begin comprehensive purchases on June 9th.

The formulation of this new wheat purchase price, in addition to taking into account the interests of production, transportation, and sales, also particularly emphasized regional price differences in order to expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. For example, Yangzhou and Taizhou are both wheat production and sales areas, and the commercial circulation relationship between them is not very large, so the wheat prices in the two places are the same. Nantong is a sales area, so the wheat price is on average about 4% higher than Yangzhou and Taizhou. Yancheng and Huaiyin are production areas, so the wheat price is lower than in Yangzhou and Taizhou, guaranteeing reasonable profits for transporters.

In terms of the difference between new and old wheat prices and the rice-wheat price ratio, the phenomenon of unreasonably widening price differences in the past production season has also been reversed. In the past, the price difference between new and old wheat in the production season was generally that 100 jin of new wheat was worth 50 to 60 jin of old wheat. This year, due to the increase in the price of new wheat, the price ratio between new and old wheat has been greatly reduced. Taking Yangzhou as an example: one jin of new wheat is 850 yuan, and old wheat is 1,000 yuan, so the price ratio between new and old wheat has reached 8.5 to 10. In terms of the rice-wheat price ratio, taking Yangzhou as an example: last year, 100 jin of new wheat was only worth 51 jin of medium indica rice; according to this year's new wheat price, 100 jin of wheat is worth 79 jin of rice.

Farmers, seeing that the company's posted prices are reasonable, feel that their production interests are guaranteed.

### 苏北各地国营粮食公司全面挂牌收购新麦

　　苏北各地国营粮食公司全面挂牌收购新麦
    苏北地区新麦目前已普遍登场，中国粮食公司苏北分公司根据上级公司指示，按照各地新麦产销情况，制订了合理的收购价格，于六月九日通知各地分支机构展开全面收购。
    这次新麦收购价格的制订，除了照顾到产、运、销三方面利益外，并为扩大城乡物资交流，对地区差价尤其注重。如扬州、泰州两地皆是小麦产销地区，相互间的商业流转关系不太大，因此两地麦价相平；南通是销区，所以麦价平均约高于扬州、泰州百分之四；盐城、淮阴因是产区，所以麦价又较扬州、泰州两地为低，保证了贩运者有合理的利润。
    在新陈麦价与米麦价格的差比上，亦扭转了过去产季比价不合理扩大的现象。过去产季新陈麦价的比差，每百斤新小麦一般抵值陈小麦五十斤至六十斤，今年因新麦价格提高，新陈麦比价已较过去缩小了很多。以扬州为例：每斤新小麦是八百五十元，陈小麦是一千元，这样新陈麦比价已达八·五比一○。在米麦比价上，以扬州为例：去年一百斤新小麦只抵值中籼米五十一斤；照今年新小麦价格每百斤小麦已抵值七十九斤大米。
    农民看到公司的牌价合理，都感到自己的生产利益有了保障。
