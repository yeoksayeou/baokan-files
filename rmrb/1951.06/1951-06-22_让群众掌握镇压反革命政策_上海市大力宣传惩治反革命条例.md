　　Let the Masses Master the Policy of Suppressing Counter-Revolutionaries
    ——Shanghai Vigorously Promotes the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries
    Shanghai is vigorously promoting the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." The purpose is to enable the masses to correctly grasp the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, further expose counter-revolutionary elements, and establish security pacts. Publishing and printing organizations have recently printed a large number of relevant materials to publicize them to the masses. Before the end of May, the Liberation Daily had successively printed and distributed 168,500 copies of the "Illustrated Explanation of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries." Xinhua Bookstore sold more than 226,000 copies of the selected excerpts from the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries in a short period. The initial edition of 1.5 million copies of the "Popular Illustrated Edition of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China" published by the East China People's Publishing House has been sold out, and another 500,000 copies are now being reprinted. Wenhui Daily also published 30,000 copies of the "Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries" study manual. Factories, schools, government agencies, and organizations are organizing their personnel to study the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries; many neighborhoods are also using bulletin boards, big-character posters, broadcasts, and slides to publicize these regulations to the masses. The trade union of the French-owned Electric Power Company enlarged the "Illustrated Explanation of the Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" into a huge colored comic strip two zhang high and two zhang five chi wide, and posted it at the intersection. Street residents and passers-by all looked up and stopped to read it carefully. At present, relevant departments are continuing to promote relevant publicity materials and learning materials to the masses through various methods. For example, the Newspaper Industry Association and the Broadcasting Industry Association printed 630,000 copies of the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries" and distributed them to the masses. There are two ways to distribute them: one is through the Resist America, Aid Korea branches in various districts; the other is through radio broadcasts to introduce them and mobilize listeners to go to the radio station to pick them up. The latter is a relatively new and very effective method. Eighteen radio stations using this method issued 160,000 copies in twelve days. Those who went to the radio station to pick them up included representatives or individuals from factories, government agencies, schools, winter defense service teams, farmers' associations, literacy classes, welfare and relief organizations, Hui Muslim organizations, Buddhist organizations, and other units, as well as unemployed workers and neighborhood residents. People from neighboring counties, such as Suzhou, Jiading, and Nanhui, also wrote to the radio station to pick them up. All radio stations paid attention to taking care of unorganized masses during distribution; for units that picked up large quantities, they first estimated the number of people in the unit, and then issued them appropriately.

　　让群众掌握镇压反革命政策
    ——上海市大力宣传惩治反革命条例
    上海市正大力宣传“惩治反革命条例”。目的是使群众能正确掌握镇压反革命政策，进一步检举反革命分子，订立保安公约。出版印刷机关最近大量印制了有关材料，向群众进行宣传。解放日报社在五月底以前，已陆续印发了十六万八千五百份“惩治反革命条例图解”。新华书店在短期内售出了有关惩治反革命条例的活页文选二十二万六千多份。华东人民出版社出版的“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例图解通俗本”，初版一百五十万册已经销完，现正续印五十万册。文汇报也出版了“坚决镇压反革命”学习手册三万册。各工厂、学校、机关、团体正组织本单位人员学习惩治反革命条例；许多里弄也都利用公告板、大字报、广播、幻灯等，向群众宣传这一条例。法商电力公司工会，把“惩治反革命条例图解”放大成二丈高、二丈五尺宽的巨幅彩色连环图，张贴在马路口。街道居民和来往行人，都仰首驻足，细看细读。目前，有关部门正用各种方法继续将有关宣传品、学习材料向群众推广。如报业公会和广播业公会印制了六十三万份“惩治反革命条例”，向群众散发。散发的方法有二：一是通过各区的抗美援朝支会散发；一是通过广播电台广播介绍，动员听众前往电台索取。后者是一种较新的而且收效很大的方法。采用这种方法的十八个电台，在十二天中就发出了十六万份。前往电台索取的包括工厂、机关、学校、冬防服务队、农会、识字班、福利救济团体、回民团体、佛教团体等单位的代表或个人以及失业工人、里弄居民等。邻近各县，如苏州、嘉定、南汇等地人民，也都写信向电台索取。各电台在散发时都注意照顾无组织群众；对大量索取的各单位，先估计该单位的人数，然后适当发给。
