　　Hebei Province has achieved significant results in suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

　　Public security throughout the province has become more consolidated. According to the average statistics for February, March, and April in the province, incidents of sabotage of public security by secret agents and bandits decreased by about 70% compared to January. In Cangxian County, no major sabotage cases occurred from January to April. Many counter-revolutionaries have repented and registered with the government, handing over reactionary documents and firearms, requesting to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. According to statistics from the five special districts of Tianjin, Tangshan, Handan, Xingtai, and Tongxian, and the city of Qinhuangdao as of mid-May, counter-revolutionaries have handed over a total of 155 rifles, 3 machine guns, and 6,519 rounds of ammunition. Some landlords who had counter-attacked asked people to return land and items to the farmers, requesting lenient treatment. Some controlled elements who were not very honest in the past are now behaving honestly. Some said to the village cadres: "I will definitely engage in good production in the future." The local peasant masses believe: "The elements who did bad things in the past were crooked and dishonest, but now they look like normal people."

　　The people's political enthusiasm throughout the province has also greatly increased. Various places have universally exposed hidden counter-revolutionaries and actively assisted the government in capturing them. Tongxian County has received 964 accusatory letters since February. With the help of the masses, the public security organs of Funing County captured Zhao Ziheng and Yue Xinghua, the top counter-revolutionary ringleaders who had been investigated for a long time but had not been caught. Among village cadres and militiamen, there have been many exemplary cases. For example, when Liu Xuezhi, a counter-revolutionary element in Zhao Zizha Village, Huanghua County, fled on a bicycle at night, the village cadre chased him for more than 100 li that night and captured him and sent him to the county. When Hou Qin, the squad leader of Wentun Village, Xincheng County, was escorting the counter-revolutionary murderer Xie Qingyuan, the criminal knelt down and begged for mercy, saying: "If you save my life, I will give you 800 jin of oil, a rubber-tired cart, a mule, ten mu of good land, and also give you my 25-year-old daughter." Hou Qin immediately refused sternly.

　　After severely suppressing the counter-revolutionary elements who sabotaged production and construction throughout the province, the masses' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly increased, and they are working hard to improve production. After Tangshan executed Wu Lisheng, Ding Jiaxiang and other key counter-revolutionary elements who had been lurking in factories and mines for a long time to carry out sabotage, the production of Tangshan Steel Plant, Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Coal Mine, Qixin Porcelain Factory and other factories and mines has significantly improved. The liberated peasants are no longer afraid of landlords counter-attacking to seize land, and are actively launching a high-yield competition movement. Farmers in Louxi Village, Huanghua County, went out to buy manure and stepped up production. After Tongxian executed Liu Songting, the chairman of the Tongzhen Pseudo-Chamber of Commerce and counter-revolutionary element, who was extremely guilty and hated by everyone, the business community of Tongzhen celebrated one after another, and 612 industrial and commercial households quickly completed the tax task of 150,000 jin of rice.

　　All sectors of the people in the province are now establishing security organizations to assist the government in completely eliminating hidden counter-revolutionary elements. The industrial and commercial circles of Tongxian County have organized "joint defense teams," workers in various factories and mines in Tangshan have established a system of shift handover and entry and exit signature inspections, and the vast rural areas are also organizing "public security defense committees" in order to regularly conduct anti-spy and anti-agent struggles and consolidate the victorious results of this suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

　　After Suiyuan Province vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries, the emotions of the people of all nationalities and all walks of life rose, and the entire province presented a new atmosphere. After the people's governments at all levels legally executed a batch of counter-revolutionary elements who were extremely guilty, the people's emotions were extremely excited. The people of Jining City happily sang the ballad "Millennial grievances are avenged in one day, and a hundred years of suffering are eliminated in one day." Farmers in the suburbs of Guisui City held rallies to celebrate the victory in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. After the Tuoketuo County People's Government suppressed the local tyrant landlord Wang Zong, Wang Guibao, a farmer whose son was killed by Wang, hung up a portrait of Chairman Mao and bowed deeply in salute. The businessmen in various towns and cities talked about "no bandits robbing, and business will be better in the future." Lamas in Kundulun Temple and other places praised the People's Government for suppressing counter-revolutionaries and eliminating harm for the people, and prayed for Chairman Mao's longevity.

　　The suppression of counter-revolutionaries has removed obstacles for urban and rural trade and production and construction work. Since the Ulanqab League region eliminated the counter-revolutionary armed bandit Zheng Dianqing and others, the business trips have become convenient, and the material exchanges between the Mongolian grasslands and the inland cities have become increasingly prosperous. According to statistics from Guisui and Baotou in early April, more than 300 merchants have driven more than 2,000 camels loaded with brick tea, cloth, groceries and other goods to the grasslands to exchange for fur. Thirty merchants who recently returned to Guisui City alone exchanged for more than 10,000 various animal skins. Before Zheng and other bandits were eliminated, none of the fur merchants in Guisui and Baotou were willing to go to the grasslands to do business. After the secret agent Mu Shengxiu and others lurking in the Guisui Electric Flour Mill were executed, Yin Fenglin, a boiler worker in the factory, said: "In the past, the factory had boils on its spine, and there was no communication between the top and bottom; now that the boils have been removed, the top and bottom are working together!" The enthusiasm of the workers in the factory has been greatly increased, and they have challenged each other. The flour yield has increased from 62% to 68%, the power consumption per bag of flour has decreased from 3.1 to 2.6, and the cost of flour has decreased by more than 6%. All the workers in the factory have signed patriotic covenants, preparing to create higher production records.

　　The people's political enthusiasm throughout the province has also greatly increased, actively exposing and assisting the government in arresting counter-revolutionary elements. In March and April, one-fourth of the counter-revolutionary elements arrested throughout the province were exposed or assisted in capture by the people. Some long-unapprehended major counter-revolutionary criminals were also captured with the help of the people. For example, Zhang Tingzhi, the bandit leader and pseudo-"Ningxia Militia Commander" who had been engaged in counter-revolutionary activities for more than 20 years and had killed countless people in Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Suiyuan provinces, was hiding in Daqing Mountain and was discovered by the militiamen of the Fifth District of Wuchuan County. The militiamen immediately notified and assisted the county public security forces in capturing Zhang, treading on more than five inches of snow. Gao Laixiang, an old farmer in his sixties in Tuoketuo County, was severely beaten by the secret agent Guo Zhanhai before liberation. After the People's Government executed Guo, he was deeply moved and actively assisted the government in capturing counter-revolutionary elements. He once traveled to three counties, more than 40 villages, and more than 1,000 li in one month, assisting the government in investigating and capturing 28 counter-revolutionary elements.

　　The Hui people in the Guisui City Hui Autonomous Region exposed 38 counter-revolutionary elements. He Qinghai, a Christian in Baotou City, sent Wang Genxin, a secret agent who had killed 17 people and was hiding in the church, to the city's Public Security Bureau.

　　In the mass exposure movement, hidden counter-revolutionary elements felt they had no way out and surrendered themselves one after another. In April, 100 counter-revolutionary elements surrendered themselves in Baotou City, handing over 9 telephones, more than 20 guns, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, and reporting a lot of information about counter-revolutionary organizations. Now, residents of many cities and villages in the province have universally signed covenants to eliminate bandits and eliminate secret agents, and have established permanent organizations to prevent spies and secret agents.

　　在镇压反革命运动中人民政治热情大为提高        
    河北绥远普遍建立群众性的治安组织
    扫除了经济建设障碍，工农业生产和贸易呈现新气象
    河北省镇压反革命工作已有显著成效。
    全省治安已更趋巩固。据全省二、三、四三个月平均统计，特务、土匪破坏治安事件比一月份减少了百分之七十左右。沧县一月到四月，没有发生过重大破坏案件。不少反革命分子向政府悔过登记，交出反动证件和枪支等，要求立功赎罪。据天津、唐山、邯郸、邢台、通县五个专区和秦皇岛市截止五月中旬的统计，反革命分子已共交出长短枪一百五十五支、机枪三挺、子弹六千五百一十九发。有些反攻的地主托人向农民退地退东西，要求宽大处理。一些被管制的不大老实的分子，现在也表现老实了。有的对村干部说：“我今后一定好好生产。”当地的农民群众认为：“干过坏事的分子过去歪头歪脑不老实，现在像个样子了。”
    全省人民群众的政治积极性也大为提高。各地普遍检举隐藏的反革命分子，并积极协助政府捕捉反革命分子。通县从二月以来已收到控诉书九百六十四件。抚宁县公安机关在群众帮助下，捕获了侦察多时没有捉住的反革命首恶赵子恒、岳兴华。在村干部和民兵中，更出现了许多模范事例。如黄骅县赵子扎村反革命分子刘学治夜间骑自行车逃跑，村干部当夜追赶了一百多里路将刘匪捕获送县。新城县温屯村中队长侯勤押解反革命杀人犯谢庆元时，该犯跪地求饶说：“你要救我一命，给你八百斤油，一辆胶皮车，一个骡子，十亩好地，还把我二十五岁的闺女送给你。”侯勤当即严词拒绝。
    全省各地严厉镇压了破坏生产建设的反革命分子后，群众生产积极性空前提高，努力改进生产。唐山处决了长期潜伏在工厂和矿场中进行破坏的反革命首要分子吴立生、丁家骧等后，唐山钢厂、开滦唐家庄煤矿、启新瓷厂等厂矿的生产都有显著提高。翻身农民也再不怕地主反攻夺地，积极展开丰产竞赛运动。黄骅县楼西村农民四出买粪，加紧生产。通县处决了罪大恶极、人人痛恨的通镇伪商会会长、反革命分子刘松亭后，通镇工商界纷纷庆祝，六百一十二户工商户很快地完成了十五万斤米的税收任务。
    全省各界人民为协助政府彻底清除暗藏的反革命分子，现正分别建立保卫组织。通县工商界已组织了“联防小组”，唐山各厂矿工人已建立了交接班和出入厂签名检查等制度，广大农村也正在组织“治安保卫委员会”，以便经常进行防奸细防特务的斗争，巩固这次镇压反革命胜利的成果。    （新华社）
    绥远省大张旗鼓镇压反革命后，各民族各界人民情绪高涨，全省呈现一片新气象。各地人民政府依法将一批罪大恶极的反革命分子处决后，人民情绪极为振奋。集宁市人民愉快地唱出“千年冤仇一朝报，百年苦事一日消”的歌谣。归绥市郊农民纷纷举行大会，庆祝镇压反革命的胜利。托克托县人民政府镇压了恶霸地主王综后，被王匪杀害了儿子的农民王贵保，挂起毛主席的像深深鞠躬致敬。各城镇的商人们谈论着“没土匪抢劫，今后的生意好做了”。昆都仑召等地喇嘛赞扬人民政府镇压反革命为民除害，祝祷毛主席万寿无疆。
    镇压反革命为城乡贸易和生产建设工作扫除了障碍。乌兰察布盟地区自肃清了反革命武装股匪郑殿青等以后，商旅往来方便，蒙古草地与内地城市的物资交流日渐畅旺。据归绥、包头两市四月上旬的统计，已有三百多商人赶着两千多头骆驼，满载砖茶、布匹、杂货等物品去草地换取皮毛。仅归绥市最近回来的三十多商人，就换回各种兽皮一万多张。在郑匪等未被肃清前，归绥、包头两市的皮毛商没有一家愿去草地经营。潜伏归绥市电机磨面厂的特务分子穆生琇等被处决后，该厂锅炉工人尹凤林说：“过去厂内是脊梁长毒疮，上下不通气；现在挖了疮，上下一个劲了！”全厂工人生产热情高涨，相互提出挑战。现出粉率由百分之六十二提高到百分之六十八，每袋面耗电量由三点一降到二点六，面粉成本降低百分之六强。全厂工人都订立了爱国公约，准备创造更高的生产纪录。
    全省人民政治热情也大大提高，积极检举并协助政府逮捕反革命分子。在三、四两个月中，全省逮捕的反革命分子中由人民检举或协助捕获的达四分之一。有些久未捕获的反革命要犯也在人民群众的协助下一一就擒。如进行反革命活动二十多年、在陕西、宁夏、绥远三省杀人无数的匪首伪“宁夏民兵司令”张廷芝，藏在大青山上，被武川县第五区民兵发觉。民兵当即通知并协助县公安部队踏着五寸多深的大雪活捉了张匪。托克托县六十多岁的老农民高来祥，解放前曾遭特务郭占海毒打。人民政府处决郭匪后，他深受感动，积极协助政府捕捉反革命分子。他曾在一个月内奔走三个县，四十多个村庄，一千多里路，协助政府侦察并捕捉了二十八个反革命分子。
    归绥市回民自治区的回民曾检举出三十八个反革命分子。包头市基督教徒贺青海将隐藏在教内、杀害过十七个人的特务王根新送交市公安局。
    在群众性的检举运动中，隐藏的反革命分子感到走头无路，纷纷投案自首。包头市在四月份有一百个反革命分子投案，交出电话机九部、枪二十多支和子弹数千发，并报告了不少反革命组织的材料。现在该省许多城市和乡村的居民，已普遍订立剿灭土匪肃清特务的公约，建立起经常性的防奸细、防特务组织。
