    Mr. Xiao Zou's Article Attempts to Abolish Ideological Struggle
        (I) To the Editors:
    Mr. Xiao Zou believes that "'Wu Xun's Spirit' cannot be accepted by the broad masses today, and it is even more impossible to produce a mass movement," and that "Promoting Wu Xun's spirit is one thing, and whether the broad masses accept Wu Xun's spirit is another." Therefore, he believes that even if the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" has errors, it will not have much impact. I think this is a very wrong statement. This is an attempt to abolish the struggle on the ideological front. Of course, today the broad masses of people, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have greatly improved their political awareness. However, it cannot be denied that feudal reactionary ideas still exist in the minds of some people. We should actively promote Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to completely eradicate these reactionary ideas. If we do not actively carry out this ideological struggle, and allow those who promote reactionary ideas to spread widely and deceive the masses, it is equivalent to laying down our weapons on the ideological front and surrendering to reactionary ideas. Obviously, Mr. Xiao Zou's attempt to abolish ideological struggle is extremely wrong.          Beijing University, Liu Junjun
        (II) To the Editors:
    Mr. Xiao Zou said: "'Wu Xun's Spirit' could not have the slightest impact in the Mao Zedong era." This is a complete distortion of the facts. Before the People's Daily published the editorial "Pay Attention to the Discussion of the Movie 'The Life of Wu Xun'," even many Communist Party members praised "Wu Xun's Spirit." After the Department of Education of the Northeast People's Government pointed out the mistake of the Dalian Normal School in educating students with "Wu Xun's Spirit," they still refused to remove the portrait of Wu Xun they had hung up. And after the discussion of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" was launched, there were still many people who blindly praised Wu Xun. This fully shows that bourgeois reactionary ideas have not only invaded the revolutionary ideological field, but are also quite stubborn. Does Mr. Xiao Zou not know these facts? Can these erroneous thoughts and behaviors not be criticized and allowed to develop?
    This kind of statement defending the promotion of reactionary ideas is an intolerable mistake.

    萧奏先生写的文章企图取消思想斗争
        （一）编辑同志：
    萧奏先生认为“‘武训精神’不可能为今天的广大群众所接受，更不可能产生一种群众性的运动”，“宣扬武训精神是一回事，广大群众接不接受武训精神是另外一回事”，因此，他认为电影《武训传》即使有错误的话，也不会发生多大的影响。我认为这是非常错误的言论，这是一种企图取消思想战线上进行斗争的说法。固然，今天广大人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，政治觉悟已经大大提高了；但是，不能否认，封建反动思想，还在某些人的头脑中存在着。我们应该积极地宣扬马克思、列宁主义，毛泽东思想，不断地运用批评与自我批评的武器，彻底铲除这些反动思想。假如我们不积极地进行这种思想斗争，而让那些宣传反动思想的东西普遍流传，欺骗群众，就等于我们在思想战线上放下武器，对反动的思想投降了。非常明显，萧奏先生这种取消思想斗争的企图，是极端错误的。          北京大学  刘珺珺
        （二）编辑同志：
    萧奏先生说：“‘武训精神’在毛泽东时代就不可能发生丝毫影响。”这完全是抹杀事实的说法。在人民日报发表社论《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》前，甚至有不少共产党员都歌颂了“武训精神”。旅大师范学校在东北人民政府教育部指出他们以“武训精神”教育学生的错误后，还不肯撤除所挂的武训像。而电影《武训传》讨论展开后，还有不少人仍旧盲目地歌颂武训。这充分说明资产阶级反动思想，不但侵入了革命的思想领域，而且还相当顽固不化。萧奏先生对这些事实难道不知道吗？对这些错误的思想行为，能够不进行批判，而听任其发展吗？
    这种替宣传反动思想做辩护的言论，是使人不能容忍的错误。
