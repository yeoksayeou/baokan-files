　　All-India Peace Council
　　Calls on People to Stop the Korean War
    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 10th] The All-India Peace Council has called on all peace committees throughout India to commemorate "Korean Peace Day" on June 25th—the anniversary of the day the U.S. instigated the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to launch the Korean War.
    The All-India Peace Council has called for mass rallies to be held on the 25th, demanding a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and an investigation into MacArthur's crimes.
    The weekly *Crossroads* published the All-India Peace Council's appeal and commented, "Asia is filled with the danger of war today due to the slander of China as an 'aggressor' and the further announcement of an illegal embargo against China. Unless we resolutely struggle now to stop the Korean War, we are in danger of being drawn into a world war."

　　号召人民制止朝鲜战争
    【新华社新德里十日电】全印和平理事会号召印度各地所有的和平委员会在六月二十五日——美国指使李承晚匪帮发动朝鲜战争的周年日——纪念“朝鲜和平日”。
    全印和平理事会号召在二十五日举行群众大会，要求和平解决朝鲜问题，外国军队立即撤出朝鲜，并调查麦克阿瑟的罪行。
    《十字路》周报刊载了全印和平理事会的号召，并发表评论说：“由于诬蔑中国为‘侵略者’和进一步宣布对中国实行非法禁运，今天亚洲已充满战争危险。除非我们现在坚决奋斗制止朝鲜战争，我们就有被卷入世界大战的危险。”
