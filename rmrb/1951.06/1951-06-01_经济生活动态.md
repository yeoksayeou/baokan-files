    Establish Inspection System to Unify Product Specifications - Hangzhou Silk Quality Improves and Sales Gradually Expand
    The silk weaving industry in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, is gradually implementing an inspection and pricing system to standardize product specifications. Currently, there are over 1,200 silk weaving workshops of various sizes in Hangzhou. Generally, these workshops rely on silk merchants to handle sales. Very few silk merchants and trading firms purchase directly, while there are many weaving households seeking to sell, leading to unreasonable prices. To maintain profits, silk weaving households resort to cutting corners, resulting in a decline in product quality.
    This year, to improve the product quality of small weaving households, the Hangzhou City Industry and Commerce Bureau called for the establishment of unified specifications. On March 10th, the Industry and Commerce Bureau convened an expanded meeting with representatives from the China Silk Company, silk weaving and silk merchant guilds, and the Silk Market Management Committee. They decided to form a "Silk Market Inspection Committee" and a "Pricing Committee" composed of representatives from the above units.
    Later, silk weaving businesses, eager to sell off-spec inventory, were taken advantage of by a few silk merchants who seized the opportunity to drive down prices for bulk purchases, while refusing to buy qualified products. To support the standardization of specifications, the Industry and Commerce Bureau encouraged silk weaving businesses to educate silk merchants while contacting state-owned enterprises to purchase at reasonable prices. This greatly encouraged the confidence of the silk weaving industry in making improvements. Currently, the inventory of products woven without specifications has been mostly sold out, and the production of products woven according to specifications has increased relatively, and market transactions have also become normal. Due to the improvement in product quality, representatives from various regions who came to Hangzhou to visit the local product and specialty exhibition and exchange conference have placed orders with the conference business office and the joint sales office, or established transportation and sales relationships. The Hangzhou City Industry and Commerce Bureau is now guiding the silk weaving industry to continue formulating unified specifications for ninety types of Jiuxia satin products and to consolidate the existing specifications.

    Song Chengquan, a Farmer in Beizhai Village, Handan, Hebei Province, Responds to the Government's Call to Plant More Patriotic Cotton
    Song Chengquan, a farmer in Beizhai Village, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, responded to the People's Government's call to "plant more patriotic cotton" by planting cotton on twenty-eight mu of his thirty-seven mu of cultivated land; and selected ten mu of irrigated land among them as "high-yield cotton fields," planning to harvest 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu of "high-yield cotton field," and to challenge the labor models of the entire prefecture and the Handan Farm with this goal. The highest national cotton yield record is 745 jin per mu, created by Qu Yaoli, a Shanxi agricultural labor model. Handan Farm also set a record of 608 jin per mu last year. Song Chengquan's goal of harvesting 1,000 jin per mu was met with disbelief by many old farmers. Song Chengquan first used a new-style walking plow to till the land to a depth of one foot and two inches, then used two types of harrows, one with long teeth and one with short teeth, to harrow twice to make the soil flat, even, and fine. He used only S-2 cotton seeds; currently, he has successively applied 1,000 jin of soybean cake fertilizer and one and a half cartloads of coarse manure fertilizer per mu of land, and plans to apply topdressing fertilizer later. Many farmers, seeing his meticulous cultivation, are following his example.
            Government Assistance in Solving Difficulties with Draft Cattle and Seeds - Farmers of All Ethnic Groups in Songpan Have High Production Enthusiasm
    Farmers of all ethnic groups in Songpan, Sichuan Province, received assistance from the county People's Government in the form of seed distribution and the organization of mutual aid and labor exchange during the spring plowing season, resolving the two major difficulties of seed shortages and lack of draft cattle. The county's land is barren, and crops mainly consist of corn, potatoes, and highland barley. Farmers' income generally can only sustain them for four months. In addition, last year, the county's farmland generally suffered from disasters such as frost, snow, and hail, and the harvest was only half of the normal yield, resulting in many farmers lacking seeds during this year's spring plowing, and the lack of draft cattle was also significant, threatening to delay production. After discovering this problem, the county People's Government promptly distributed 60,000 jin of seeds and led them to organize themselves and establish mutual aid and labor exchange groups to alleviate the difficulty of insufficient animal power. Subsequently, the county's spring plowing and sowing movement also rapidly unfolded. Currently, the people of all ethnic groups have high production enthusiasm and are working hard to realize the slogan of "no one starves, no land is wasted," and some farmers are actively reclaiming land for production.

    建立检验制度统一产品规格  杭绸质量提高销路逐渐扩大
    浙江杭州市丝织业正逐步实行检验、议价制度，以统一产品规格。杭州市丝织业目前有大小厂坊一千二百多家，这些厂坊中，一般都依靠绸商解决推销问题。收购的绸商、行商单位极少，要出售的机户很多，因此价格很不合理。丝织业机户为了保持利润，便以偷工减料来对付。于是，产品质量越来越不好。
    今年，杭州市工商局为了改进小机户产品质量，号召建立统一规格。三月十日，工商局并邀集中国蚕丝公司，丝织、绸商两业公会，绸市场管理委员会等代表开扩大会议，决定由以上各单位代表组织“绸市场检验委员会”和“议价委员会”。
    后来，丝织业急于脱售不合规格的存货，少数绸商乘机压价大量收购，对检验合格的成品则不予收购。工商局为支持统一规格，一面鼓励丝织业教育绸商，一面联系国营企业以合理价格收购。这样，大大鼓舞了丝织业的改进信心。目前不照规格织造的存货已基本销完，按照规格织造的产品产量相对增加，市场交易也已趋正常。由于产品质量的提高，各地来杭州参观土产、特产展览交流大会的代表，纷纷向大会业务处和联合推销处订购，或建立运销关系。杭州市工商局现正指导丝织业继续制订九霞缎九十种产品的统一规格，并巩固现已制定的规格。

    河北邯郸北寨村农民宋成全响应政府号召多种爱国棉
    河北邯郸专区北寨村农民宋成全响应人民政府“多种爱国棉”的号召，在自己三十七亩耕地中植棉二十八亩；并在其中挑出十亩水浇地作为“丰产棉田”，打算在每亩“丰产棉田”上收籽棉一千斤，并以此向全专区的劳动模范及邯郸农场挑战。按全国最高产棉纪录是每亩七百四十五斤，是山西农业劳动模范曲耀离所创，邯郸农场去年也创出了每亩六百零八斤的纪录。宋成全这回要收一千斤，很多老农民都摇头不信。宋成全首先用新式步犁耕地，耕到一尺二寸深，再用长短齿二种耙耙二遍使土壤平整匀细；棉种全用斯字二比棉；现每亩地已经陆续上了豆饼一千斤，粗肥一车半，准备以后还要施追肥。许多农民看到他这样精耕细作，就都跟着他学。
            政府协助解决耕牛种籽困难  松潘各族农民生产情绪高涨
    川西松潘各族农民在春耕中得到县人民政府发放种籽和组织互助变工的帮助，解决了缺乏种籽和耕牛两大困难。该县土地瘠薄，农作物以玉茭、马铃薯、青稞为主，农民收入一般只能维持四个月生活，加以去年全县农田普遍受到霜雪、冰雹等灾害，收成只有常年产量的一半，以致今年春耕时很多农民缺乏种籽，耕牛也大大缺乏，眼看就要耽误生产。县人民政府发现这个问题后，即及时地发放了六万斤种籽，并领导他们组织起来，成立互助变工小组解除畜力不足的困难，接着全县春耕播种运动也就迅速展开了。现各族人民生产热情高涨，正在为“不饿死一人、不荒废寸土”口号的实现而努力，有的农民并积极开荒生产。
