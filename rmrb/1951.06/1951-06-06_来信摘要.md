　　Summary of Letters to the Editor
            Rural and Urban Product Exhibitions are Excellent Patriotic Education
    After seeing the rural and urban product exhibition in Changwei Special District, Shandong Province, I deeply felt the greatness of the working people and the loveliness of our motherland. At the exhibition, I saw new spinning machines, water pumps, chaff cutters, corn threshers, and corn more than a foot long, eggs weighing four or five ounces... These were unseen before liberation. They are the result of the hard work of workers and the active production of farmers under the leadership of the Communist Party after liberation.
    The products of Changwei area are only a small part of the products of the motherland, but there are so many and so good, let alone the entire People's Republic of China?! Especially seeing several special products famous throughout the country and even the world, I deeply felt the greatness of the motherland, which generated a strong sense of patriotism and strengthened my confidence in winning the war against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and building the motherland. Our motherland has so many superior conditions. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we are fully qualified and confident to defeat U.S. imperialism and any aggressors, and build our motherland into a beautiful and happy country.

    Suggest Publishing Learning Materials About Tibet to Help Everyone Understand the Situation of Brotherly Nationalities
    The peaceful liberation of Tibet has reached an agreement, and we are all very happy. We are eager to further understand Tibet and the situation of our brotherly nationalities. However, there are too few learning materials in this regard to meet our needs. Because the old materials were compiled by the Kuomintang reactionaries to deceive the people and provoke national feelings. Today, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, all nationalities in China are closely united! We should have a correct understanding of the past history of our brotherly nationalities, their anti-imperialist struggles, and their political, economic, and cultural conditions. Therefore, I suggest that the publishing organs introduce some good materials about Tibet in the near future to help us learn.

            Certain Areas Should Pay Attention to Newspaper Retailing
    I recently traveled from the southwest to the northeast of the motherland, and I couldn't buy newspapers to read in many places along the way. For example, in Quanxian County, Guilin Special District, Guangxi Province, I couldn't buy the Guibei Daily published in Guilin; in Andong City, Northeast China, I couldn't buy the Northeast Daily; and at Baoding Station, I couldn't buy the Hebei Daily published in Baoding City. Of course, it cannot be said that these newspapers are not retailed at all in these places; but I did spend a lot of effort in these places. In some cases, I ran all over the station and nearby streets, and in others, I ran all over a county town (such as Quanxian County, Guangxi), but I still couldn't buy them. Therefore, I suggest that the above-mentioned places improve newspaper retailing to facilitate the masses' reading of newspapers.

        Road-building Workers in Jianyang County, Southern Sichuan, Discover Ancient Tang Dynasty Buddhist Statues and Steles
    On May 7th, when the first brigade of the road-building workers' detachment in Jianyang County, southern Sichuan, was building the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, they unearthed ancient objects from the Feixianyan Temple of the Stone Buddha in the Baitaba work area, one kilometer outside the south gate of the city. The statues were exquisitely carved, and there were three ancient steles beside the side pillars of the stone temple, with the words "First Year of Tiaolu" inscribed on them. Professor Zhang Shengzang of the Southwest Ministry of Culture and Education's Relics Survey and Collection Group believes that these are ancient Buddhist statues and steles from the Tang Dynasty Gaozong period in 679 AD, which are of great research value. Now, the Jianyang road-building workers' detachment has handed over these ancient objects to the Cultural Center for proper preservation.

            Using and Promoting Domestic New Products to Promote the Development of New China's Industry
    The State Council of the Central People's Government made a resolution on "rewarding the creation of substitutes" in the "Decision on the Production and Construction of State-owned Industries in 1951" promulgated at the end of April. I think this is of positive significance for the development of our country's industry. In the newspapers, we have constantly seen that workers and staff in various places have overcome difficulties and exerted their high creative talents to manufacture new products that could not be manufactured in the past.
    The electrical industrial products such as yellow wax cloth, pipe benders, electricity meters, and steel wire flexible shafts seen at the National Electrical Industry Conference Exhibition not long ago are all of good quality. In the past, these things mostly relied on imports to solve, which shows that our industrial technology is rapidly improving. We should massively promote the use of domestically made new products. Only in the process of promoting the use, and constantly improving them, can we make our products more sophisticated.

       Administrative Bureaucracy in Hangu Tianjin Chemical Plant Accumulates More Than 100 Rationalization Proposals
    Since the Hangu Tianjin Chemical Plant launched the labor competition in October last year, the administrative leaders have accumulated more than 100 rationalization proposals from employees without processing them, causing considerable losses to production. The four suggestions put forward by the Liu Baozhong group of the substation are very important. For example, they suggested that the indoor temperature is too high, and workers often feel dizzy from the heat, so the administration should install ventilation equipment; the copper shaft of the No. 1 converter has been worn with grooves for many years; the switchboard of the No. 2 converter is too rusty, and the shaft tile is too loose, which needs to be repaired as soon as possible, otherwise it is easy to cause accidents to the shaft tile and the switchboard, affecting the operation. Employees have made more than 100 similar rationalization proposals, but the administrative leaders have been slow to deal with them. In order to implement these suggestions, trade union cadres have found various departments to study them several times, but they shirk their responsibilities to each other. The trade union cadres found the factory director five times in the past half month, but the problem was not solved. As a result, on May 6, the acute meter of the No. 2 converter burned out. Fortunately, the workers discovered it early, and no major accident was caused. I suggest that the leading cadres of our factory quickly change the shortcomings of ignoring the rationalization proposals of the workers.

            Wanping Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Transfer Station Should Not Steal or Leak Stamp Duty
    The Wanping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative's transfer station for mountain products, located in the 16th district of Beijing, does not pay attention to the state's tax policies and often issues shipping invoices and receipt of funds with missing stamp duty stamps. When the Wanping County Tax Bureau inspected the tax situation in March and April, it found 83 tax-evading documents from the freight station in the second, third, and fourth districts of the county alone, with a total of more than 720,000 yuan in missing stamp duty stamps. Although this matter has been dealt with by the 12th District Tax Bureau of Beijing (the money receipts have been subsidized with stamp duty stamps according to regulations; the tax-evading shipping invoices have been fined 2.85 million yuan), the cooperative's freight station should conduct a deep review of this serious violation of the government's tax policy. Cooperatives should be models of implementing national tax policies.

            A Sinister Conspiracy of a Landlord Bully in Yunnan

Editor:
    Fu Youde, a landlord bully in Shagou Village, Kunming County, Yunnan Province, served as a puppet township chief for more than 20 years, extorting labor and money, raping women, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. After liberation, the local area implemented rent reduction and deposit refunds. Fu Youde spread rumors and sabotage everywhere, and threatened the peasants, saying: "The Americans are helping Chiang Kai-shek to fight back, and you are still making trouble like this?" The peasants did not listen to him and exposed his rumors and sabotage, and resolutely demanded that he return the rent grain that should be returned. Fu Youde used various methods of threats and inducements to the peasants, but all failed, so he used the most vicious means to treat the peasants. He pretended to agree to return the rent and asked the village cadres to notify each household in the village to send one person to his house to settle the rent account. - On the day everyone went to settle the account, Fu Youde had charcoal burning in his house, and he himself sat by the fire smoking grass cigarettes. After everyone was sitting around the fire, Fu Youde stood up and suddenly threw a can of gunpowder into the fire. With a loud bang, the room was immediately filled with black smoke. At that time, six peasants were burned. Fu Youde immediately drank the opium wine he had prepared in advance, preparing to fight the peasants. Fortunately, everyone immediately put out the fire, and the firewood that Fu Youde had placed upstairs and downstairs in advance did not catch fire. The peasants immediately tied up Fu Youde and sent him to the government.
    After this incident, the cadres and peasants in Shagou Village were shocked. They said: "The landlord bully is so vicious!"

　　来信摘要
            城乡产品展览会是很好的爱国教育
    我看了山东省昌潍专区城乡产品展览会，使我深感到工农劳动人民的伟大和祖国的可爱。我在展览会上看到那些新的纺纱机、压水机、铡草机、玉米脱粒机，和一尺多长的玉米、四五两重的大鸡蛋……。这些在解放以前，是见不到的。这是解放后在共产党领导下工人同志的努力创造和农民们积极生产的结果。
    昌潍地区的物产不过是祖国物产的一小部分，但就有这么多，这么好，那何况整个的中华人民共和国呢？！尤其看到几种全国甚至全世界闻名的特产，使我深感到祖国的伟大，由此产生了一种浓厚的爱国心，加强了我对抗美援朝建设祖国的胜利信心。我们祖国有这么许多优越的条件，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，我们完全有条件有信心战胜美帝国主义和任何侵略者，把我们的祖国建设成一个美丽的幸福的国家。

    建议出版有关西藏的学习材料  帮助大家了解兄弟民族的情况
    西藏和平解放已经取得协议了，我们大家都非常高兴。我们迫切希望进一步了解西藏，了解我们兄弟民族的情况。但是，这方面的学习材料太少，不能满足我们的要求。因为旧的材料，都是国民党反动派所编，用以欺骗人民、挑拨民族感情的东西。今天，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，中国各民族紧紧地团结起来了！我们应当对兄弟民族的过去历史，兄弟民族的反帝斗争，及其政治、经济、文化情况有一个正确的了解。因此，我建议出版机关能在最近介绍一些有关西藏的好材料，来帮助我们学习。

            某些地区应注意报纸的零售工作
    我最近从祖国的西南到东北走了一趟，一路上在很多地方买不得报纸看。如在广西省桂林专区的全县就买不到桂林出版的桂北日报；在东北安东市买不到东北日报；在保定车站也买不到在保定市出版的河北日报。当然，在这些地方不能说完全没有这些报纸零售；但我在这些地方确实花了不少功夫，有的是跑遍了车站及附近的一些街道，有的则跑遍了一个县城（如在广西的全县），也都买不到。所以，我建议上述地方改进报纸的零售工作，以便利群众阅读报纸。

        川南简阳县筑路民工发现唐代佛像古碑
    川南简阳县民工筑路支队第一大队五月七日修筑成渝铁道时，在距城南门外一公里的白塔坝工区掘出石佛飞仙岩庙古物。佛像形态雕琢极精，石庙侧柱旁并有古碑三块，上刻“调露元年”字迹。西南文教部文物调查征集组张圣奘教授认为，这是公元六七九年唐高宗时佛像古碑，很有研究价值。现在简阳民工筑路支队已将这些古物移交文化馆妥为保存。

            使用和推广本国的新产品  推动新中国工业的发展
    中央人民政府政务院在四月底公布的“关于一九五一年国营工业生产建设的决定”中，曾作出了“奖励创造代用品”的决议，我认为这对发展本国工业是具有积极意义的。在报纸上我们曾不断看到各地职工克服困难，发挥高度创造才能制出过去无法制造的新产品。
    不久前在全国电业会议所举办的电业展览会上所看到的黄腊布、弯管机、电度表、钢丝软轴等电器工业用品，品质都很好。过去，这些东西多依靠进口来解决，这就说明我们的工业技术在迅速地提高。对本国自制的新产品，我们应该大量地推广使用。只有在推广使用的过程中，不断地加以改进，才能使我们的产品更加精良。

       汉沽天津化工厂行政官僚主义作风  积压合理化建议一百余件
    汉沽天津化工厂自去年十月份开展劳动竞赛到现在，行政领导干部积压了职工的一百余件合理化建议不处理，使生产受到不少损失。变电所刘宝忠小组提出的四件建议都很重要。如他们提出：室内温度太高，工人热得经常头昏，建议行政上搞通风设备；一号变流机铜轴年久磨出了沟；二号变流机配电盘生锈过多，轴瓦旷荡，这些都需要及早修理，否则容易使轴瓦和电盘出事故影响开车。类似这样的合理化建议，职工提有一百多条，行政领导干部迟迟不予处理。为了实现这些建议，工会干部曾几次找到各科研究，他们却互相推托责任。最近半个月工会干部找了厂长五次，也不解决问题，结果于五月六日二号变流机急性表烧坏，幸工人发觉较早，未造成重大事故。我建议我厂领导干部，迅速改变不理会工人合理化建议的缺点。

            宛平供销社转运栈不应偷漏印花税
    宛平县供销社设在北京市十六区的转运山货栈不重视国家税收政策，经常开出漏贴印花税票的发货票与款项收据。宛平县税务局在三、四月间检查税收情况时，仅在该县二、三、四区就查出了该货栈的漏税单据八十三件，共漏贴印花税票七十二万余元。此事虽已经北京市十二区税务局处理（银钱收据照章补贴印花税票；漏税的发货票已罚款二百八十五万余元。）但该合作社货栈对这种严重违反政府税收政策的行为，应作深刻检讨。合作社应该是执行国家税收政策的模范。

            云南一个恶霸地主的险恶阴谋编辑同志：
    云南省昆明县沙沟村恶霸地主傅有德，曾当过二十多年伪乡长，抓丁勒索，强奸妇女，无恶不作。解放以后，当地实行减租退押。傅有德到处造谣破坏，并威吓农民说：“美国人帮助蒋介石要打回来了，你们还这样胡闹？”农民们不听他这一套，揭露他的造谣破坏行为，并坚决要他退出应退的租谷。傅有德向农民使用了各种威胁利诱的办法都失败了，他就用最毒狠的手段来对待农民。他假装同意退租，让村干部通知全村每户去一个人到他家算租账。——大家去算账的那一天，傅有德家中烧着炭火，他自己坐在火边抽着草烟。等到大家都围着火坐好以后，傅有德站起来，突然把一罐火药投到火里，轰然一声，顿时满屋黑烟。当时就有六个农民被烧伤。傅有德这时立刻把预先准备好的鸦片烟酒喝了，准备和农民拚命。幸亏大家立即把火扑灭了，傅有德预先在楼上、楼下放置的引火柴，都没有燃着。农民们当即把傅有德捆绑起来，送到政府。
    这件事发生以后，沙沟村的干部和农民都大吃一惊，他们说：“恶霸地主竟是这样毒辣！”
