　　Communist Party Organizations Should Participate in the Discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun"!
　　The General Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture of the Communist Party of China Formulates a Plan for Discussing "The Life of Wu Xun"
　　The General Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture of the Communist Party of China, in order to implement the instruction of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to "launch a discussion on 'The Life of Wu Xun'", convened a meeting on May 26th, focusing on discussing the leadership of this work, and made specific plans, which were submitted to the Party Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and distributed to various branches, calling on all party members to seriously organize the discussion of this major issue, and requiring each branch to conscientiously take responsibility for leadership.
　　The study time is scheduled for three weeks, starting from May 28th and ending in mid-June. The specific progress is as follows: The first week (May 28th to June 2nd) is for reading and studying various relevant documents and materials, listening to enlightening reports from responsible comrades, connecting with one's own thoughts, and conducting serious, sincere, and honest self-examination, and then launching criticism and self-criticism in group meetings. The second week (June 4th to 9th) is for conducting a thorough self-examination of thoughts within the entire general branch, and launching a more systematic criticism of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun", and writing a written examination report. Comrades with lower cultural levels who cannot write should use the method of speaking at group meetings and recording the minutes. The third week (June 11th to 16th) is for each branch to be responsible for reviewing and studying the written examination reports and group records of the comrades, and publicizing the results at the branch general meeting, praising those who write profoundly and conscientiously, criticizing those who are perfunctory, and providing assistance to those who examine more superficially due to limitations in their level. Among them, works (written reports) that are correctly understood and deeply examined should be sent to the general branch for review, which will be responsible for research and evaluation, and submitted to the higher-level Party committee for approval before being introduced for publication in Party newspapers and Party journals. During this week, it is planned to convene a general meeting of all party members of the general branch, with the responsible comrade of the general branch giving a summary report to conclude this discussion.
　　According to this plan, the General Branch of the Bureau of Culture convened a meeting of party members on May 29th, and absorbed members of the Youth League branch committee and non-Party cadres who are more administratively responsible in various units. Comrade Yu Ling, deputy secretary of the general branch, reported at the meeting. After pointing out the significant political significance of launching a discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun," he, as a responsible comrade in cultural work and film work, made a serious self-criticism for failing to discover the errors of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun" in a timely manner. This set a vivid example for the comrades.
　　　　　The Wanbei District Party Committee Corrects the Wrong Attitude of Underestimating the Discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun"
　　After reviewing its erroneous attitude of turning a blind eye to the erroneous propaganda of "The Life of Wu Xun," the Wanbei District Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed the propaganda departments of the Party committees in cities that had screened "The Life of Wu Xun" to seriously organize party members who had watched "The Life of Wu Xun" in various institutions to participate in the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun." The purpose of the discussion is to enable party member cadres to better grasp the basic principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, eliminate the erroneous understanding of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun," establish correct standpoints and viewpoints, and improve the ideological level of party members.
　　During the discussion, one can study the People's Daily editorial "The Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun' Should Be Valued" and "Communists Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun'" and other relevant articles. When organizing discussions, the Party branches should absorb non-Party cadres who have watched "The Life of Wu Xun" to participate. And pay attention to reporting the results of the discussion to the newspapers.
　　　　　Party Member Cadres of Organs in Southern Anhui Criticize the Erroneous Understanding of Wu Xun
　　The Southern Anhui District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting on May 27th, gathering responsible cadres from the propaganda, cultural, and educational departments of various organs, the political department of the military region, various mass organizations, and committees directly under the District Party Committee, to arrange for the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." At the meeting, Ma Tianshui, secretary of the District Party Committee, pointed out the significance of discussing "The Life of Wu Xun." He said: At present, most of the cadres in the organs in Southern Anhui still have confused thoughts and erroneous understandings of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Therefore, it is necessary to launch a discussion on the film "The Life of Wu Xun" in order to clarify the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism through this discussion, and to clearly establish the idea of class struggle and eliminate the idea of reformism. After the meeting, the Propaganda Department of the Southern Anhui District Party Committee formulated a plan for discussing "The Life of Wu Xun"; and instructed the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee directly under the committee and the Propaganda Department of the Wuhu Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to lead and organize this discussion; in the discussion, it is necessary to mobilize everyone to connect with their own thoughts and criticize all the erroneous thoughts about the film "The Life of Wu Xun."

　　　　　Hebei Province Organizes Party Member Cadres to Participate in the Discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun"
　　Various cities and special districts in Hebei Province are organizing party member cadres to participate in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun." At the end of last month, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China notified the propaganda departments of various municipal committees and district committees, and the branches of various provincial-level organs, to organize relevant party member cadres to participate in the discussion of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun"; and required the propaganda departments of various municipal committees and district committees (especially in areas where the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has been screened and where Wu Xun has had a deeper impact and where Wu Xun was active), to cooperate with the cultural and educational departments to be responsible for organizing relevant party member cadres (mainly those in the cultural and educational circles) to conduct discussions during their spare time. In addition to Linqing Town, Linqing County, and Guantao County, which must conduct discussions, other counties and towns do not need to conduct special discussions, but should read relevant articles in the newspapers. The notice also pointed out: During the discussion in various places, several main issues should be raised for discussion based on the ideological situation exposed; during the discussion process, the propaganda department of the Party committee or a party member cadre with theoretical cultivation designated by the department should make certain reports on relevant issues. At the same time, it is necessary to organize articles of reflection, discussion, and criticism as much as possible, and submit them to the People's Daily, Hebei Daily, or the "Study" publication of Hebei Province.

　　共产党组织应参加关于《武训传》的讨论！
    中共上海市文化局总支订出讨论《武训传》的计划
    中共上海市文化局总支部，为了执行中共上海市委“开展对《武训传》的讨论”的指示，在五月二十六日召开了会议，着重讨论了对这一工作的领导，并作出了具体计划，呈报上海市人民政府党委会，并发给各个支部，号召全体党员同志要严肃认真组织这一重大问题的讨论，要求各个支部认真负责领导。
    学习时间预定三个星期，自五月二十八日开始，到六月中旬结束。具体进度为：第一周（五月二十八日到六月二日）阅读研究各个有关文件材料，听取负责同志的启发报告，联系自己思想，进行认真的、虚心的、老老实实的检查，然后在小组会上展开批评与自我批评。第二周（六月四日到九日）全总支范围进行一次深刻的自我思想检查，并对武训及《武训传》展开较有系统的批判，写成书面检查报告。文化水准较低，不能写作的同志，用小组会上发言，作记录的办法。第三周（六月十一日到十六日）各支部负责审阅研究同志们的书面检查报告与小组记录，并将结果在支部大会上公布，写得深刻的、认真的给以表扬，草率的给以批评，因水准限制检讨得较为肤浅的则给以帮助。其中认识正确、检查深刻的作品（书面报告）应送总支审阅，由总支负责研究评定，呈报上级党委批准后，介绍在党报、党刊上发表。在这一周内，准备召开一次全总支党员大会，由总支负责同志作总结报告，以结束这一讨论。
    根据这一计划，文化局总支于五月二十九日召开了党员大会，并吸收青年团支部委员和各单位行政上较为负责的非党干部参加。会上由总支副书记于伶同志报告。他在指出展开对《武训传》讨论的重大政治意义后，即以自己身为文化工作、电影工作的负责同志，对武训及电影《武训传》的错误未能及时发现，作了严肃的自我检讨。这给同志们做了一个生动的榜样。
            皖北区党委纠正了轻视《武训传》讨论的错误态度
    中共皖北区委员会，检讨了对《武训传》错误的宣传采取熟视无睹的错误态度后，即指示本区凡放映过《武训传》的城市的党委宣传部门，必须严肃地组织各机关看过《武训传》的党员，参加对《武训传》的批判。讨论的目的，要使党员干部更好地掌握辩证唯物论与历史唯物论的基本原则，肃清对武训及《武训传》电影的错误认识，树立正确的立场与观点，以提高党员的思想水平。
    讨论时可学习人民日报“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”的社论与“共产党员应当参加关于《武训传》的批判”及其他有关文章。党的各支部在组织讨论时，应吸收看过《武训传》的非党干部参加。并注意向报纸报道讨论的结果。
            皖南区机关党员干部批判对武训的错误认识
    中共皖南区党委员会，于五月二十七日召集皖南区各机关、军区政治部、各群众团体及直属党委会的宣传、文教部门负责干部开会，布置关于电影《武训传》问题的讨论。会上由区党委书记马天水指出讨论《武训传》的意义。他说：目前在皖南机关干部中，对《武训传》电影存在着混乱思想与错误认识的仍占多数。因此必须开展对电影《武训传》的讨论，以便通过这一讨论弄清马克思列宁主义的立场、观点与方法，明确树立阶级斗争的思想，肃清改良主义的思想。会后，皖南区党委宣传部拟订了讨论《武训传》的计划；并指示区党委直属党委会及中共芜湖市委宣传部领导与组织这一讨论；在讨论中要发动大家联系自己思想，批评对电影《武训传》的一切错误的思想。
                                                      （白丁）
            河北省组织党员干部参加《武训传》的讨论
    河北省各市、专区正组织党员干部参加《武训传》的讨论。上月底，中共河北省委通知各市委和地委的宣传部，及省级各机关支部，组织有关党员干部参加对武训与《武训传》的讨论；并要求各市委和地委的宣传部（特别是放映过《武训传》电影和受武训影响较深及武训活动过的地区），要结合文教部门，负责组织有关党员干部（应以文化教育界为主），利用业余时间进行讨论。除临清镇、临清县、馆陶县必须进行讨论外，其他县、镇不必专门进行，但要阅读报纸上的有关文章。通知中并指出：各地讨论时要就所暴露的思想情况提出几个主要问题讨论；在讨论过程中，由党委宣传部或指定有理论修养的党员干部，就有关问题作一定的报告。同时尽可能组织反省、讨论、批判的文章，向人民日报、河北日报或河北省的《学习》刊物投稿。
