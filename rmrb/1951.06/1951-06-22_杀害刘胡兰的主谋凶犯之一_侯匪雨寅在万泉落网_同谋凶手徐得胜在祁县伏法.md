One of the Masterminds Behind the Murder of Liu Hulan
	Hou Bandit Yuyin Arrested in Wanquan
	Accomplice Xu Desheng Executed in Qi County

	Hou Bandit Yuyin (mistakenly reported as Hou Bingyin in this newspaper's June 5th report), one of the masterminds behind the murder of Liu Hulan, has been arrested in Wanquan County, Shanxi Province. Hou Bandit Yuyin was the deputy battalion commander of the First Battalion, 215th Regiment, 72nd Division of Yan Xishan's bandit army. Before the murder of Liu Hulan and other comrades, he, together with Battalion Commander Feng Bandit Xiaoyi, jointly convened Company Commander Xu Bandit Desheng and Company Instructor Zhang Bandit Quanbao to discuss the execution plan. Hou is currently 42 years old and a native of Baoquanzhuang, Jishan County, Shanxi Province. In 1939, he joined Yan Xishan's special agent organization "Comrades Association" and the Kuomintang, successively serving as sergeant clerk, second lieutenant member, lieutenant member, major officer, and deputy battalion commander in Jiang's and Yan's bandit armies. In February 1947, Hou was captured by our army in Lishi County, Shanxi Province, changed his name to Hou Zhenzhou, and falsely reported himself as a bandit army platoon leader. He was released by us on March 16th of the same year. However, after returning home, Hou organized a so-called "Southern Shanxi Guerrilla Detachment" reactionary armed force, appointing himself as the captain, plotting to riot when the opportunity arose. However, Hou did not escape the people's grasp and was arrested by our Wanquan County Public Security Bureau on April 17th.

	Xu Bandit Desheng (original name Xu Fengying), one of the murderers of Liu Hulan, was executed in Qi County, Shanxi Province, on April 4th. Xu was a native of Wucun Village, Qi County, Shanxi Province, and came from a despotic landlord background. In 1937, he joined Yan Xishan's bandit army and later joined Yan's special agent organization "Comrades Association." In 1947, Xu served as a company commander in Yan's bandit army and, on January 12th of that year, commanded his troops to surround Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, and executed Liu Hulan and other comrades with a guillotine. Xu was therefore promoted to battalion commander by Yan. After our army liberated Wenshui County in February of the same year, Xu fled to his hometown of Wucun Village, Qi County, and continued to commit evil. In 1948, our army liberated Qi County, and the criminal fled to Jialing Town in the same county, hiding in the Wanhetang Pharmacy, attempting to await an opportunity to act. During this suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the people exposed this counter-revolutionary element, laden with five years of blood debts. The government accepted the people's demands and executed Xu by firing squad in Wucun Village, Qi County, on April 4th.

　　杀害刘胡兰的主谋凶犯之一
    侯匪雨寅在万泉落网
    同谋凶手徐得胜在祁县伏法
    杀害刘胡兰的主谋凶犯之一侯匪雨寅（本报六月五日报道中误为侯丙寅）已在山西省万泉县落网。侯匪雨寅为阎锡山匪军七十二师二一五团一营副营长，在杀害刘胡兰等同志之前，曾与该部营长冯匪效义共同召集连长徐匪得胜、连指导员张匪全宝谋商执行计划。侯犯现年四十二岁，为山西省稷山县宝泉庄人，一九三九年参加阎锡山特务组织“同志会”及国民党，历任蒋阎匪军的上士文书、少尉组员、中尉组员，少校处员及副营长等职。一九四七年二月，侯犯在山西省离石县为我军俘获，改名侯震宙，自报为匪军排长。同年三月十六日被我释放。但侯犯回家后竟组织所谓“汾南游击支队”反动武装，自任队长，图谋待机暴乱。但侯犯并未逃出人民手掌，于四月十七日被我万泉县公安机关逮捕归案。

    杀害刘胡兰的凶手之一徐匪得胜（原名许凤英），已于四月四日在山西省祁县伏法。徐犯是山西省祁县武乡村人，恶霸地主出身。一九三七年参加阎锡山匪军，后又参加阎匪特务组织“同志会”。一九四七年，徐犯任阎匪军连长，于当年一月十二日指挥他的部队包围文水县云周西村，将刘胡兰等同志用铡刀铡死。徐犯因此被阎匪提升为营长。同年二月我军解放文水县城后，徐犯逃至原籍祁县武乡村，继续作恶。一九四八年我军解放祁县，该犯又逃至本县贾令镇，潜伏在万和堂药房，企图待机活动。此次镇压反革命运动中，人民把这个隐藏了五年的血债累累的反革命分子检举出来。政府接受人民的要求，已于四月四日在祁县武乡村将徐犯枪决。
