　　Eradicating Erroneous Educational Thoughts Like Wu Xun's
    Li Yimang

    Whether we are discussing the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," the comic book of "The Life of Wu Xun," or Wu Xun himself, it seems we should address a fundamental issue, namely the issue of educational thought. Because the movie "The Life of Wu Xun," the comic book, and Wu Xun himself, raised and attempted to solve and promote this kind of educational thought: regardless of the social system, as long as people can read, all difficulties can be resolved. It was from this thought that Wu Xun adopted his set of methods.

    From Wu Xun onwards, to Liang Shuming's rural education, James Yen's mass education, and so on, all belong to this category of educational thought. It does not trigger the fundamental problems of the people's suffering at the time; it believes there is no need to trigger those fundamental problems. Only by thoroughly criticizing this thought can we thoroughly criticize the thoughts of the author of "The Life of Wu Xun" and Wu Xun.

    Some people believe that Wu Xun's educational thought is reformism, is the kind of thought of saving the country through education. This is also incorrect. It is not reformism but surrenderism, flatteryism; it is not saving the country through education, it only enables a very small number of people, the few people in front of them, to read. Similarly, to affirm rural education, mass education, and other kinds of education, is not reformism or saving the country through education. Reformism and the thought of saving the country through education go further than Wu Xun's educational thought.

    The situation in the late Qing Dynasty could not be solved not only by Wu Xun-style educational thought, but even by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao's reformist political reforms, and even less by Zhang Zhidong's "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application" theory of enriching the country and strengthening the military. Even the "Xinhai Revolution" of 1911, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty, did not solve China's fundamental problems at that time. Chairman Mao pointed this out in detail at the beginning of his "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Wu Xun attempted to solve a trivial problem at the time, the problem of whether the people could read, a problem of putting the cart before the horse.

    The formula of the revolutionary派 is: overthrow the feudal system and the rule of imperialism—land reform—economic construction—cultural construction (including running schools, literacy). The formula of people like Wu Xun is: literacy—consolidate the existing social system at the time.

    Even in today's great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, Chairman Mao still said: "Do everything possible to devote great efforts to the restoration and development of the people's economic undertakings, and at the same time restore and develop the people's cultural and educational undertakings." (Speech at the preparatory meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) He also said: "With the advent of the upsurge of economic construction, a upsurge of cultural construction will inevitably appear." (Opening speech of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference). He never said: "Do everything possible to devote great efforts to the restoration and development of the people's cultural and educational undertakings, and at the same time restore and develop the people's economic undertakings." or said: "With the advent of the upsurge of cultural construction, a upsurge of economic construction will inevitably appear." Then, in the time of the Qing Dynasty, in the time of the Northern Warlords, in the time of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, what practical significance did the literacy movement, rural education, mass education, and other education promoted by Wu Xun-style educational thought have for the working people at that time? Then what is our intention today in using movies and comic books and other texts to praise this educational thought?

    May I ask, at that time, even if a small part of Tangyi, Guantao, and Linqing, and even if this small part were poor farmers, became literate, what would be the result? Would they not be bullied by the landlords? Obviously, the working people at that time were not suffering from illiteracy, but from the rule of feudal exploitation. Literacy cannot eliminate the oppression of this rule. On the contrary, based on the textbooks at the time, the result of this kind of free school education would only be to increase a group of gatekeepers and helpers for the bureaucratic landlords out of thin air, and even turn around to oppress the people. This is self-evident. What good results did later mass education, rural education, and other education have during the reactionary Kuomintang period? It can be asserted that the results would not be very different from the free schools promoted by Wu Xun. Isn't the general cultural level of European and American capitalist countries relatively high? Aren't there many literate people? What are the living conditions and political conditions of those literate workers and farmers?

    Therefore, we must not only criticize Wu Xun's strange behavior, but also focus on criticizing Wu Xun's type of educational thought, and further oppose movies, comic books, and other texts that promote and advocate that type of educational thought through Wu Xun. It is absolutely necessary today to eliminate all educational thoughts of this kind since Wu Xun, to seriously criticize and liquidate them, and to truly establish a systematic new democratic educational thought. In this regard, educators in New China have done some work in the past two years, such as introducing Soviet educational theories and educational systems and criticizing Dewey, etc.; but obviously, we have not done enough in clearing away old educational thoughts. Otherwise, we would not have been paralyzed by movies like "The Life of Wu Xun."

    Of course, by saying this, we are not opposing the literacy movement, we are not opposing eliminating illiteracy, we are just saying that there is a distinction between fundamental problems and trivial problems, there is a distinction between primary and secondary, and order. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Coalition Government" that "eliminating illiteracy from 80 percent of the population is a necessary condition for building a new China." It can be seen that the Communists attach great importance to the popularization of people's culture. But only now, are there the prerequisite conditions for carrying out the literacy movement and eliminating illiteracy, and it is absolutely impossible to imagine carrying out the literacy movement with Wu Xun's impossible and absurd method. In fact, regardless of Wu Xun's educational thought, even in terms of Wu Xun's method, it is meaningless to promote or eulogize Wu Xun with movies and comic books today.

    According to the director's own account, the screenwriter and director of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" were influenced by Tao Xingzhi. It should be said that Sun Yu has gone much further and used deeper scheming in promoting Wu Xun than Tao Xingzhi, but in any case, Tao Xingzhi's educational thought is infected with Wu Xun's thought. It cannot be said that his promotion of Wu Xun's thought under the reactionary Kuomintang rule at that time had some kind of painstaking effort. He was a person who truly believed in Wu Xun's thought, and did not borrow Wu Xun for some kind of painstaking effort. At the same time, Tao Xingzhi's educational thought is one of several old educational thoughts that should be examined. His efforts in the anti-Kuomintang revolutionary struggle should not be taken into account and his educational thoughts should be tolerated or approved without principle. His efforts in the anti-Kuomintang struggle should be respected, but the errors in his educational thoughts must be criticized. Otherwise, we cannot establish a correct new democratic educational thought. The reason why some educators currently praise the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" and still rarely criticize or examine it, it cannot be said that they are not also influenced by Tao Xingzhi. Tao Xingzhi's educational thought still has a certain influence among our educators, because of Tao Xingzhi's promotion of Wu Xun's thought, some of our educators unthinkingly wrote things in favor of the movie "The Life of Wu Xun."

    Clearing away all the erroneous educational thoughts that still have influence is an important part of the basic content that the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun" should have.

### 清除武训一类的错误教育思想

　　清除武训一类的错误教育思想
    李一氓
    讨论《武训传》的电影也好，《武训传》的连环画也好，武训本人也好，我们似乎应该接触一个基本问题，即教育思想的问题。因为《武训传》的电影、连环画及武训本人是提出了并试图解决与推行这种教育思想的。这种教育思想是：不管社会制度怎样，只要人们认识了字，就可以解除一切困难。正是从这种思想出发，武训就采取了他的一套办法。
    从武训起，一直到梁漱溟的乡村教育，晏阳初的平民教育等等，都是属于这一类的教育思想的。它不去触发当时人民遭受苦难的基本问题，它认为无须去触发那些基本问题。只有彻底批判了这种思想，我们才能彻底批判《武训传》作者和武训的思想。
    有人认为武训的教育思想是改良主义，是教育救国的这一类思想，这同样是不对的，它不是改良主义而是投降主义，是捧场主义；它也不是教育救国，它仅是使极少数的人，眼面前的几个人认识字而已。同样的要肯定乡村教育，平民教育及别的什么教育，也不是什么改良主义与教育救国这一类思想，改良主义与教育救国这一类思想还要比武训这一类教育思想，走得更远一点。
    满清末代的那种情况，不仅武训式的教育思想不能解决它，就连康梁一派的改良主义的政治改革，等而下之如张之洞的《中学为体西学为用》的富国强兵论，也不能解决它。甚至后来的一九一一年推翻满清的“辛亥革命”，也没有把中国当时的基本问题解决了。这一点毛主席在他的《论人民民主专政》的开始就详细地指明了。武训试图解决的乃是当时一个枝节问题，人民识字不识字的问题，一个本末倒置的问题。
    革命派的公式是：推翻封建制度和帝国主义的统治——土地改革——经济建设——文化建设（包括办学校，识字）。而武训一类人的公式是：识字—巩固当时的现存社会制度。
    甚至在中国人民革命大胜利的今天，毛主席还说：“尽一切可能用极大力量从事人民经济事业的恢复和发展，同时恢复和发展人民的文化教育事业。”（在中国人民政治协商会议筹备会上讲话）又说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”（中国人民政治协商会议开幕词）。他就不曾说：“尽一切可能用极大力量从事人民文化教育事业的恢复和发展，同时恢复和发展人民的经济事业。”或说：“随着文化建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将出现一个经济建设的高潮。”那末，满清皇朝的当时，北洋军阀的当时，国民党反动统治的当时，武训式的教育思想所提倡的识字运动，乡村教育，平民教育及其他什么教育之类，对于当时的劳动人民有什么实际意义呢？那末我们今天用电影与连环画及其他的文字来表扬这种教育思想，又是什么居心呢？
    试问当时即令堂邑，馆陶，临清的一小部分人，而且即便这一小部分就是贫苦农民认识了字，结果又怎么样呢？是不是就不会受地主欺负了呢？显然当时的劳动人民不是吃亏在不识字，而是吃亏在受着封建剥削的统治。识了字并不能解除这种统治的压迫。相反地，以当时的教材而论，这种义学教育的结果，只会是凭空增加一批官僚地主的门客、帮手，更加反转来压迫人民，这是不言而喻的事情。后来的平民教育，乡村教育及其他什么教育在反动国民党时期有什么好结果呢？可以断言和武训所推行的义学的结果不会差得很远。欧美资本主义国家的一般文化水准不是比较高的吗？不是识字的很多吗？那些识了字的工人农民其生活情况和政治情况又怎样呢？
    因此我们不仅要批评武训的那种奇怪行为，而且要着重的批评武训那一类教育思想，进而反对借武训来宣传与提倡那一类教育思想的电影、连环画及其他文字。清除自武训以来所有的这一类教育思想，严肃地加以批评和清算，真正确立起新民主主义的有系统的教育思想，在今天是完全有必要的。在这方面两年来新中国的教育工作者是做了一些工作的，如介绍苏联的教育学说和教育制度及批评杜威等；但显然在清算旧的教育思想上，我们还特别做得不够。不然我们就不会被《武训传》这样的电影所麻痹了。
    当然，这样说，我们不是要反对识字运动，不是要反对扫除文盲，我们只是说这里有个基本问题和枝节问题的分别，这里有个主从的先后的分别。毛主席在《论联合政府》中就提出“从百分之八十的人口中扫除文盲，是建立新中国的必需条件。”可见，共产党人是极端重视普及人民文化的问题的。但只有现在，这才有了进行识字运动，扫除文盲的前提条件，而且也绝对不可以设想用武训式的那种不可能的荒谬办法来进行识字运动。事实上，不论武训的教育思想，即以武训的办法而论，今天以电影与连环画来宣传或歌颂武训也是没有意义的。
    《武训传》电影的编导与拍摄，据编导者的自述，是受了陶行知的影响。应当说，孙瑜在宣传武训的工作上是比陶行知走的远得多，心机用的深得多，但是不管怎么样，陶行知的教育思想是感染有武训思想的。不能因为在当时反动国民党统治下而说他的宣传武训思想是有某种苦心，他是真正信服武训思想的一人，并非由于什么苦心而来借用武训一下。同时，陶行知的教育思想是应该受到检查的若干种旧教育思想之一，不应该因为他本人尽力于反国民党的革命斗争而就迁就他的教育思想，无原则地加以原谅或赞成。他尽力于反国民党的斗争应该受到尊敬，但是他的教育思想中的错误就必须受到批判。不然我们就不能确立新民主主义的正确的教育思想。目前若干教育工作者对于《武训传》的电影之所以加以赞扬，并且至今也很少有所批判或检讨，也不能不说同样是受有陶行知的影响。陶行知的教育思想在我们教育工作者中是保有他一定的影响的，因为陶行知的宣扬武训思想，所以我们有些教育工作者不加思索地就写东西赞成《武训传》的电影了。
    清除现在尚有影响的一切错误的教育思想，是《武训传》讨论所应有的基本内容的重要部分。
