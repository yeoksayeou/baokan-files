    Tianjin Railway Bureau Holds Touring Public Security Exhibition
    Over 100,000 Visitors Received Education
To the Editor:
    The touring public security exhibition organized by the Public Security Department of the Tianjin Railway Bureau concluded at the end of May. Over the course of eighty-seven days, the exhibition was held successively at fifteen major stations including Tianjin, Beijing, Tangshan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, and Gui Sui. The total number of visitors from all walks of life was approximately 100,000, including over 24,000 railway employees.
    The public security exhibition enhanced the political consciousness of the masses and promoted the mass movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries.
    Among the employees, there were several erroneous ideas. Some felt, "So what if there are special agents? What's the big deal?" Others believed, "How could there be special agents within the railway?" Some held a purely production-oriented viewpoint, only knowing to immerse themselves in production, regarding the prevention of spies and special agents as the sole responsibility of the public security departments. However, the evidence of special agent crimes displayed in the exhibition provided a powerful critique of the above erroneous ideas. Facts speak louder than words. Look: The special agent Liu Xueshu damaged a direct current welding machine worth 60 million yuan (equivalent to thirteen years' income for a worker earning 165 points per month) with a handful of sand in Datong. Kuomintang agent Tian Feng damaged a locomotive with just a cold chisel, causing a loss equivalent to 250,000 catties of millet to the people's railway. The exhibition used numerous ironclad facts and bloody lessons to illustrate one point to the employee masses: "If we want to do a good job in production and build the people's railway, everyone must rise up and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!"
    In the past, some employees also believed that "Public security work is just standing guard and catching petty thieves, and it doesn't play any role in the railway production enterprise," as if "it doesn't matter whether it exists or not." But after seeing examples of sabotage by special agents displayed in the exhibition, they had a new understanding of public security work.
    Many comrades gasped when they saw the photos of special agent Fan Yuhe (executed) pulling the switch, causing three workers to fall from utility poles over ten meters high. They said, "If it weren't for the public security personnel catching special agents for us, not only would production not be guaranteed, but even our lives would be threatened by special agents!" They universally felt that the public security personnel had really done a lot for everyone. Therefore, they expressed that they would strengthen the unity between workers and public security personnel in the future. After consciously criticizing their past muddled viewpoints, many employees took practical action. For example, employees in Dezhou successively reported special agents; employees in Cangxian formulated safety guarantee conditions; workers at the Changxindian Locomotive Factory strengthened the work of the workers' patrol team and the "May 1st" security work; and comrades in the Gui Sui Second Package Crew are studying the signing of a liaison contract with the public security department. The vast number of employees within the Tianjin Railway Bureau have participated in the mass action to prevent spies and oppose special agents.
    In addition, the exhibition powerfully cooperated with the Yiguan Dao withdrawal registration work carried out on the Beijing-Baotou West Line in May. When exposing the deceptive tricks of Yiguan Dao such as "planchette writing," nine people immediately stood up on the spot to accuse Yiguan Dao of its crimes, turning the exhibition into an accusation meeting. Many employees and family members who had joined Yiguan Dao requested the public security organs to quickly process their registration for withdrawal after seeing the exhibition.
    At the same time, the public security exhibition also provided a great education to the public security personnel, making them realize that only by relying on the masses can the safety of the people's railway be ensured.

### 天津铁路管理局  举办巡回公安展览会  十万余观众受到教育

    天津铁路管理局  举办巡回公安展览会
    十万余观众受到教育编辑同志：
    天津铁路管理局公安处主办的巡回公安展览，已于五月底结束。八十七天来，先后在天津、北京、唐山、保定、张家口、归绥等十五个主要车站进行了展览。各界观众共约十万余人，内有铁路职工两万四千余人。
    公安展览会提高了群众的政治觉悟，推动了群众性的镇压反革命运动。
    职工中有这样几种错误思想：有的觉得：“有特务就有特务吧，有什么了不起？”有的认为：“在铁路内部那有特务？”有的是单纯的生产观点，只知道埋头生产，把防奸细防特务当成是公安部门单独的事。但是展览会所陈列的特务罪证，给予了上述错误思想一个有力的批评。事实胜过雄辩，看吧：特务刘学书在大同用一把沙子，就破坏了价值六千万元的直流电焊机（等于一个每月一百六十五分工资的工人十三年的收入），中统特务田丰，仅用一个扁铲破坏了一台机车，就给人民铁路造成二十五万斤小米的损失；……。展览会就这样以许许多多铁的事实，血的教训，向职工群众说明了一个问题：“我们要搞好生产，建设人民铁路，就必须要人人起来坚决镇压反革命！”
    过去也有职工认为“公安工作就是站大岗、抓小偷，对铁路生产事业没起什么作用，”仿佛“有没有都没关系”。但他们看到展览会所陈列的一些特务破坏的例证，对公安工作有了新的认识。
    许多同志看到特务范玉和（已处决）拉电闸，把三个工人从三丈多高的电杆上掉下来的照片，都倒抽了一口凉气。他们说：“要没有公安人员给咱抓特务，不但生产没有保障，连咱们的生命都受着特务威胁呀！”普遍感到公安人员真替大家办了不少事。因此，他们纷纷表示今后要加强工人和公安人员的团结。有不少职工自觉地批判了过去自己的糊涂观点后，实地行动起来。如：德县的职工，接二连三地检举了特务；沧县的职工，订了安全保证条件；长辛店机厂的工人，加强了工人纠察队工作和“五一”时保卫工作；归绥第二包乘组同志，正研究与公安部门签订联系合同。天津铁路管理局管内广大职工，已参加了防奸细反特务的群众性行动。
    另外，展览会特别有力地配合了京包西线于五月间开展的一贯道退道登记工作。在揭露一贯道“扶乩”等骗人把戏时，当场就有九个人站起来控诉一贯道的罪恶，使展览会变成了控诉会。许多人过一贯道的职工和家属看完展览，都要求公安机关赶快办理登记退道。
    同时公安展览会也给公安人员以很大教育，使他们了解到只有依靠群众，才能确保人民铁路的安全。
