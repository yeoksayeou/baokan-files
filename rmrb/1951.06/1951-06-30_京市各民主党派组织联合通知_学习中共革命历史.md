　　Joint Notice from Beijing's Democratic Parties Organizations
    Study the CCP's Revolutionary History
    [Our Newspaper] To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the organizations of democratic parties in Beijing have jointly issued a notice stipulating the study methods for members of parties, leagues, associations, and societies of democratic parties in Beijing for July. The original text of the notice is as follows:
    July 1st this year is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. In order to respond to the call of the central committees of the various parties to study the revolutionary history of the Communist Party of China, the democratic parties in Beijing have jointly decided on the method of studying relevant documents on the revolutionary history of the Communist Party of China. It is hoped that through this study, party members, league members, association members, and society members in Beijing can correctly recognize that only under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and within the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China, can the democratic parties follow the correct revolutionary line, unite and progress, and complete the revolutionary tasks of the new democracy. To this end, we jointly notify the party members, league members, association members, and society members of the democratic parties in Beijing to earnestly implement the following study methods in July:
    First, "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" written by Comrade Hu Qiaomu (separately printed by the People's Publishing House or in the People's Daily on June 22) and "The Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Democratic United Front" written by Minister Li Weihan (People's Daily, June 25) shall be the basic materials for the democratic parties to study; other commemorative essays published in the People's Daily shall be used as reference materials for study.
    Second, the comrades in charge of propaganda and education work of the democratic parties shall, in July, promote the study within the original study organizations of the democratic parties according to the jointly formulated study outline. In addition to jointly holding one introductory and one summary report meeting on the study of the history of the Communist Party of China, each democratic party shall hold at least two discussion meetings separately.
    Third, when members of the democratic parties study the above two documents, they should combine them with the current three major political movements and the three major appeals of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and write down their learning experiences based on their understanding, and publish them in their own publications or other publications.
    Fourth, members of democratic parties and the masses they are connected with should widely participate in various activities, such as report meetings, symposiums, and cultural activities, in order to further study the revolutionary and fighting spirit of the Communist Party of China.
    Fifth, in order to seize the time to concentrate on studying, the originally scheduled study plans of the democratic parties may be temporarily suspended. The study committees of the democratic parties shall hold report meetings every week to check the progress of the study, and jointly hold a study summary report at the end of July.
