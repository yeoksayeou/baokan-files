　　Automobile Company Shijiazhuang Transfer Station
　　Self-Criticism for Failing to Comply with Contractual Stipulations

Editor:
    Regarding the issue raised in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on June 8th, "Why Doesn't the Shijiazhuang Transfer Station of the Automobile Transportation Company Comply with the Coal Transportation Contract," we offer the following inspection and response:
    On April 25th, our station contracted to transport 130 tons of coal for the Lianghe Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingshan County. At that time, because we were unfamiliar with the road conditions in that area (from Pingshan City to Lianghe), we inquired of Comrade Gai from the cooperative, who said, "The road is easy to travel, there are no problems." We completely believed him and signed the contract, immediately organizing vehicles for transportation. On the first trip, a bridge on the Chuanfang River was nearly damaged. The road was indeed difficult. After that, we had to organize single-horse carriage transportation, and successively sent Comrade Lei Shuxiang from our station to inspect the road and planned to discuss solutions to this problem with the cooperative, but we did not see the person in charge of the cooperative on either occasion. Later, we tried to transport the coal by a detour, experiencing many difficulties along the way, for a total of more than ten trips. As of today, only about 1.5 tons remain, which will soon be completely transported.
    Based on the above process, the results of our inspection show that, fundamentally, our mass perspective was not strong, and we lacked sufficient responsibility for this transportation work. Therefore, we did not conduct a serious and responsible survey of the road, but blindly undertook the transportation, delaying the supply to the cooperative members. Although we thought of solutions and carried out work, due to the erroneous thinking of fearing financial losses and "it doesn't matter if it's delayed," we delayed the process. In addition to quickly transporting the remaining coal, we are determined to strengthen our work responsibility, thoroughly correct our bad thinking, and earnestly implement the contract. We also hope that all sectors will offer more suggestions to promote the improvement and development of the people's transportation cause.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　State-owned Automobile Transportation Company Shijiazhuang Transfer Station
　　Editor's Note: The Shijiazhuang Transfer Station of the State-owned Automobile Transportation Company has conducted some self-criticism regarding the issue of failing to comply with the coal transportation contract. In narrating the process of signing the contract, this self-criticism reveals that the other party concealed the true conditions of the transportation route. If this is indeed the case, then the other party is also at fault, and Comrade Gai from the Lianghe Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative should also examine his mistakes. However, the signing of a contract does not depend solely on the conditions put forward by one party, much less on the word of the other party. The Shijiazhuang Transfer Station of the State-owned Automobile Transportation Company was wrong not to conduct a serious investigation and study of the route before signing the contract; moreover, once the contract was signed, they should have overcome difficulties and earnestly implemented it. What is your view of signing the contract? Why not execute the contract because you were afraid of losing money? Why have the thought "it doesn't matter if it's delayed?" The Shijiazhuang Transfer Station does not mention this in its letter. It is hoped that they can conduct a deeper self-criticism and correct this erroneous thinking.

### 汽车公司石家庄转运栈  对不遵守合同规定的检讨

　　汽车公司石家庄转运栈
    对不遵守合同规定的检讨编辑同志：
    兹将六月八日人民日报《读者来信》栏内所刊载的《汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈为何不遵守运煤合同》的问题检查答复如下：
    我栈在四月二十五日承运了平山县两河村供销社煤一百三十吨，当时，因我们对该处（平山城至两河）路途情况生疏，即询该社盖同志，盖同志说：“路途好走，没有问题。”我们便完全相信地订立了合同，当即组织车辆进行运输。第一次运输即将川坊桥梁轧坏一根，路途实在难走。此后我们只好组织单套车运输，并先后派我栈雷书祥同志前往该村验路，并拟与该社研究解决这一问题，但两次都未见到该社负责人。后又设法绕路运输，中间经过很多困难，共运十余次；载至今日已剩三千余斤，即将运完。
    根据以上经过经检查的结果，基本上是我们的群众观念不强，对这一运输工作缺乏足够的责任心，因此没有认真地负责地对该路进行勘察了解，盲目地承揽运输，延误了对社员的供应。虽说我们想了办法，进行了工作，终因怕赔钱与“延期没啥”的错误思想，拖延了时日。我们除把所剩的煤迅速运完外，决加强工作责任心，彻底纠正不良思想，认真执行合同。并希各界多提意见，以促进人民运输事业的改进与发展。
          国营汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈启            
    编者按：国营汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈关于不遵守运煤合同的问题，已经进行了一些检讨。这个检讨中在叙述订立合同的经过时，透露出对方掩盖了运输道路的真实情况；假若真的是这样，当然对方也是不对的，两河村供销社的盖同志也应检讨他的错误。但是，双方订立合同，并不决定于一方面所提出的条件，更不决定于对方的一句话。国营汽车运输公司石家庄转运栈，在订立合同之前不认真地对路线进行调查、研究是不对的；而且，既订立合同之后，就应克服困难，认真执行。对订立合同这件事是什么看法？为什么怕赔钱就不执行合同呢？为什么会有“延期没啥”的思想呢？石家庄转运栈在这个信中没有提及。希望他们能更深入地检讨，纠正这种错误思想。
