    With the assistance of the broad masses of the people, the People's Government of Longchang County, Southern Sichuan, uncovered a bandit "Chinese Youth Party" organization that had been carrying out counter-revolutionary activities in the county for a long time. The principal culprits, Zhou Wentao, a bandit "Chinese Youth Party" alternate central committee member and executive member of the Sichuan Provincial Party Department, Zhu Airu, acting chairman of the Longchang County Party Department, Li Weixiu, member of the Longchang County Design Committee, and Zhang Gongcan, editor-in-chief of the bandit's newspaper "New China Daily," have been executed in Longchang County.
    Longchang County is the nest of the bandit "Chinese Youth Party" and the hometown of the party leader, Zeng Qi. On the eve of the liberation of Longchang in November 1949, bandit Zhou Wentao rushed back to Longchang from Chongqing, convened party members, and formulated the "Southern Sichuan Contingency Plan." They decided to adopt armed riots and covert activities as their working principles. On the one hand, they burned all files in preparation for long-term concealment; on the other hand, they organized the bandit "52nd Detachment of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Guerrilla," falsely claiming to be a "Communist Party underground armed force," and occupied the Yunding Mountains on the border of Longchang and Luxian counties. After the liberation of Longchang on December 5, 1949, bandit Li Weixiu also impersonated a Communist Party member, colluded with the local big tyrant Chen Nengfen (already executed), and organized the so-called "People's Committee." Under the name of "New Democratic Liberation Society," they absorbed backward elements and Kuomintang reactionary military officers, commanding and colluding with bandits to burn down the Longshui District Public Office, besiege Purun Township, harass Xiangshi Town, massacre the people, and sabotage the government's work in February of last year. On April 13th last year, bandit Zhang Gongcan contacted the backward elements among the former Kuomintang 72nd Army officers undergoing training in Longchang city and the bandit leader Zheng Yinwu (already executed), who was entrenched in Shengdeng Mountain, in an attempt to attack Longchang County from the inside and outside. However, due to the tight defense of the People's Liberation Army garrison, the bandits were suppressed before they could take action. After June of last year, under the encirclement and suppression of our bandit suppression troops, the bandits shifted from armed activities to covert activities, collecting intelligence on the one hand and supplying it to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang remnants in Taiwan via radio. On the other hand, they spread rumors in the areas where rent reduction and land reform were being carried out. After a long period of investigation, the Longchang County Public Security Bureau arrested the counter-revolutionary ringleaders Zhou Wentao, Li Weixiu, Zhu Airu, and Zhang Gongcan on March 27th of this year, and seized a radio transceiver and other telecommunications equipment, firearms, documents, and other items used to contact the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan. After the bandits were arrested, they were publicly tried by the People's Court, and with the approval of the higher-level government, they were sentenced to death. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　川南隆昌县人民政府        
    破获匪“青年党”组织
　　主犯周文涛等已执行枪决
    川南隆昌县人民政府在广大人民协助下，破获了长期潜伏该县进行反革命活动的匪“中国青年党”组织，主犯匪“中国青年党”候补中央委员兼四川省党部执行委员周文涛、隆昌县党部代理主席朱蔼如、隆昌县设计委员会委员李修为，及该匪机关报《新中国日报》总编辑张功灿等已在隆昌县伏法。
    隆昌县是匪“中国青年党”的巢穴，该党首领曾琦的家乡。一九四九年十一月隆昌解放前夕，周匪文涛即匆匆由重庆赶回隆昌，召集党徒，拟订“川南应变计划”，决定以武装暴乱和潜伏活动为其工作方针，一面烧毁全部档案，准备长期潜伏；一面又组织匪“川滇黔游击第五十二纵队”，伪称“共产党地下武装”，盘据于隆昌与泸县边境的云顶山脉。一九四九年十二月五日隆昌解放后，李匪修为又冒充共产党员，拉拢当地大恶霸陈能芬（已枪毙），组织所谓“人民委员会”，并以“新民主主义解放社”名义吸收落后分子及国民党反动军官等，指挥和勾结土匪，于去年二月先后烧毁我龙市区公所，围攻普润乡，骚扰响石镇，屠杀人民，破坏政府各项工作。去年四月十三日，张匪功灿曾联络在隆昌城内受训的原国民党七十二军起义军官中的落后分子及当时盘据在圣灯山的匪首郑银武（已枪毙）等，企图里应外合攻打隆昌县城，但因人民解放军驻军防备严密，该匪等未及行动，即被镇压下去。去年六月以后，在我剿匪部队围剿下，该匪等即由武装活动转入隐蔽活动，一面搜集情报，用电台供给台湾蒋匪帮残余；一面在减租、土地改革地区大肆造谣。隆昌县公安局经长期侦查后，于今年三月二十七日将周文涛、李修为、朱蔼如、张功灿等反革命首恶分子加以逮捕，并查获其与台湾蒋匪联络的收发报机一部及其他电讯器材、枪支、证件等多件。该匪等经逮捕后，经人民法庭公审，并经上级政府批准，判处死刑。（新华社）
