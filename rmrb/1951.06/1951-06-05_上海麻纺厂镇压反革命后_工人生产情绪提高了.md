　　After the Shanghai Linen Mill Suppressed Counter-Revolutionaries, Workers' Production Enthusiasm Increased
    To the Editor:
    Since our state-owned Shanghai Linen Mill purged the hidden special agents in the factory, even the traditionally backward coppersmith workshop has changed, and production has increased by ten percent.
    During the enemy and puppet rule, our factory was a factory entrenched with evil forces. After liberation, these bad elements were still oppressing the workers, so production just couldn't improve. Among this group of evil forces, some were the chairman and executive directors of the puppet trade union before liberation, and some were puppet welfare committee cadres who had received special agent training. After liberation, they still attracted and organized the "Thirty-Six Faction" in the factory to oppress the workers. These people were all thugs with blood on their hands, having participated in the Quangong Building massacre, beaten Jiaotong University students, suppressed the just struggles of workers in yarn mills such as Shenxin No. 9, Hongzhang, Yong'an, and Tongyi with guns, and monitored the actions of progressive workers. In the factory, they lent money at usurious rates, oppressed, and exploited workers. After liberation, not only did they not work properly, but they also incited discord, spread rumors, and made worker brothers disunited. Once, the packing machine in the sorting department broke down, and with the lead of activists, it was repaired in one day, but the villains attacked and satirized the activists. For example, when they saw that team leader Zheng Xuexi was active, they forced him to carry a three-hundred-pound top thimble, and wrote in white powder on the ground: "Zheng Xuexi, be careful to receive a gift." (meaning to beat him) They sabotaged production and lit oily waste under the car, attempting to burn down the factory.
    After these counter-revolutionary elements were arrested by the public security organs, the workers felt as if a big stone had been removed from their hearts. Everyone said: Now we can stand up, we can work boldly. For example, the working enthusiasm of the workers in the coppersmith workshop has been unprecedentedly improved. Although the manpower is less than before, the production has increased by ten percent. Everyone also put forward the slogan of "Not Being a Backward Workshop," further creating conditions for challenging the Ma Hengchang group.

### 上海麻纺厂镇压反革命后  工人生产情绪提高了

　　上海麻纺厂镇压反革命后
    工人生产情绪提高了编辑同志：
    我们国营上海麻纺厂自从肃清潜伏在厂里的特务后，一向生产落后的铜匠间也变了样，生产量提高了百分之十。
    我们厂在敌伪统治时期，是个恶势力盘踞的工厂。解放后这些坏分子还压在工人头上，因此，生产怎么也搞不好。这批恶势力中，有的在解放前是伪工会理事长及常务理事，有的是受过特务训练的伪福利委员会干部，解放以后，他们还在厂内拉拢组织“三十六股党”，压迫工人。这些人都是双手染满鲜血的暴徒，曾参加过劝工大楼大血案，打过交通大学学生，持枪镇压申新九厂、鸿章、永安、统益等纱厂工人的正义斗争，监视进步工人的行动。在厂里，他们放高利贷，欺压、剥削工人，解放后，他们不但不好好地干活，还挑拨离间，造谣生事，使工人弟兄不团结。有一次，整理部打包车坏了，在积极分子带头下，一天就修好了，坏蛋们就打击和讽刺积极分子。如他们看到领班郑学秀积极，就压迫他去扛三百磅重的顶针器，并用白粉在地下写着：“郑学秀，当心送礼给你。”（意思是打他）他们破坏生产，在车子底下，把油垃圾点着火，企图烧毁工厂。
    这些反革命分子被公安机关逮捕后，工友们心上好象除了一块大石头。大家说：这下子可以出头了，可以大胆工作了，如铜匠间工友工作情绪空前提高，虽然人手较前少，生产却增加了百分之十。大家并提出“不做落后车间”的口号，进一步创造了向马恒昌小组应战的条件。
