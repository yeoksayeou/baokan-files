　　重要更正
    昨日本报发表《中国共产党的三十年》一文，应作如下更正：
    （一）第六版第一栏倒数第十五第十六行“在红军胜利的影响下，一九三一年二月，进攻红军的国民党第二十六路军一万余人，在赵博生、董振堂等同志领导下，在江西宁都起义加入了红军。”这一句应在同栏倒数第九行“……也取得了许多重要的胜利。”之后，句中的“二月”应为“十二月”。
    （二）第六版第二栏倒数第十四行“一九三五年十一月，中央红军、陕北红军和由鄂豫皖、湘鄂边北上经过长征的红军紧接在会合以后，就共同地粉碎了国民党军对陕甘革命根据地的三次围攻”，应为“一九三五年十一月，中央红军、陕北红军和由鄂豫皖北上的红军紧接在会合以后，就共同地粉碎了国民党军对陕甘革命根据地的第三次围攻”。
    （三）第七版第二栏第五行“一九四一年七月”应为“一九四一年六月”。
    （四）第七版第二栏第三十二行至三十三行“但是……粉碎了这一次反共高潮。”一句，应为“但是在中国共产党的事前揭露、声讨和全国人民的反对之下，被迫停止。”
    （五）第七版第二栏第三十七行“灭亡的一年”应为“迫近灭亡的一年。”
    （六）第八版第一栏第十六行“湖南”之下，应加“、绥远”。
