　　Polish, Czech, and Romanian Newspapers Publish Commentaries
    Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Korean War of Liberation
    [Report from this newspaper] Polish, Czechoslovakian, and Romanian newspapers have published editorials or articles commemorating the first anniversary of the Korean People's War of Liberation.

    The Czechoslovakian newspaper *Rude Pravo*'s editorial pointed out: The strength of the Korean people lies in the fact that on their side is the decisive majority of humanity that hates war and loves peace.

    The Polish newspaper *Życie Warszawy*'s editorial said: The experiences of the Soviet people from 1917 to 1920 (referring to the period of the October Revolution, foreign armed intervention, and the civil war) and from 1941 to 1945 (referring to the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union), as well as the experiences of the Chinese people in recent years, fully prove that imperialist and fascist armies, if they dare to invade free nations that defend the fruits of their revolution, are bound to be defeated. Based on this reasoning, we believe that the Korean nation will certainly be able to victoriously repel American aggression.

    The Romanian Workers' Party's official newspaper, *Scînteia*, published a commentary saying: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Korean War, our people, based on Stalin's brilliant speech, express their firm belief that if the imperialists continue to reject the peaceful proposals put forward by the Chinese People's Government, then the Korean War can only end with the defeat of the interventionists. The just cause of the Korean people will surely be victorious.

    At rallies in factories and enterprises in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, and other cities, millions of working people unanimously expressed their deep indignation at the American aggressors' atrocities in Korea and expressed their firm belief that the Korean people will certainly defeat the American aggressors.

　　波、捷、罗各报发表评论
    纪念朝鲜解放战争一周年
    【本报讯】波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚等国报纸，纷纷发表社论或论文，纪念朝鲜人民解放战争一周年。
    捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》的社论指出：朝鲜人民的力量在于下述事实，即在他们一边，有着痛恨战争爱好和平的人类中的决定性多数。
    波兰《华沙生活》报的社论说：苏联人民在一九一七年到一九二○年期间（按指苏联十月革命以及外国武装干涉和国内战争时期）和一九四一年到一九四五年期间（按指苏联伟大卫国战争时期）所得到的经验以及中国人民最近数年来所得到的经验充分证明，帝国主义和法西斯的军队，如果敢于侵略那些保卫他们革命果实的自由民族，是一定要被打败的。基于这种道理，我们相信朝鲜民族是一定能够胜利地打退美国的侵略的。
    罗马尼亚工人党机关报《火花报》发表评论说：值此朝鲜战争周年纪念日之际，我国人民根据斯大林的英明的谈话，表示坚决相信如果帝国主义者继续拒绝中国人民政府所提出的和平建议，那末朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。朝鲜人民的正义事业必将获得胜利。
    在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特和其他城市的工厂、企业的集会上，千万劳动人民对美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行一致表示深切的愤慨，并表示坚信朝鲜人民一定能战胜美国侵略者。
