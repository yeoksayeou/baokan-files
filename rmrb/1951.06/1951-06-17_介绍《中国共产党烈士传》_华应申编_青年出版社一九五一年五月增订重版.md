Book Review

Introducing "Biography of Martyrs of the Communist Party of China"
	Hua Yingshen ed. China Youth Publishing House, Revised and Re-published May 1951
	Zhou Naiji
This year, July 1st, marks the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. The China Youth Publishing House has revised and re-published Comrade Hua Yingshen's "Biography of Martyrs of the Communist Party of China," and we would like to recommend this book to readers as one of the readings to commemorate this great festival.
In the thirty years of arduous struggle of the Communist Party of China, countless of the best soldiers of the Chinese nation have bravely sacrificed themselves for the lofty ideals of communism and for the happy future of the Chinese people. They concentratedly demonstrated the great revolutionary qualities and wisdom of the Chinese people, and also concentratedly demonstrated the arduous historical process of the Chinese revolution. Biographies of revolutionary martyrs are readings that we urgently need, but unfortunately there are too few such readings at present. Because this book is a selection of texts published piecemeal in newspapers and periodicals, it cannot be regarded as a complete biography, and of course it cannot include all the most memorable revolutionary martyrs. Moreover, the articles in this book were written in different periods, and some of the individual historical facts mentioned therein inevitably need to be corrected. The editor should at least add some necessary annotations. Nevertheless, at present, this book is still worth reading carefully.
The book contains materials about twenty-three martyrs. Among them, Comrades Li Dazhao, Ren Bishi, Cai Hesen, Yun Daiying, Qu Qiubai, Deng Zhongxia, Peng Pai, and Wang Ruofei were among the earliest communists in China. During the May Fourth Movement, due to witnessing the suffering of the Chinese people and the crisis of the country, and realizing the reasons for the failure of the old democratic revolution in China, they finally realized that the Chinese revolution must "take the path of the Russians," and realized that only the working class is the truly revolutionary leading class, and thus resolutely threw themselves into the flames of the working-class struggle. They played a pioneering role in the Chinese communist movement and left immortal achievements.
The struggle of the Communist Party of China began in conjunction with the Chinese workers' movement. Our Party cultivated numerous revolutionary leaders from the workers' class struggle. For example, Comrades Su Zhaozheng, Deng Zhongxia, and Deng Fa, who led the Chinese trade union movement and the international trade union movement, were all such typical figures.
The revolutionary war with peasants as the main participants was an important key to the victory of the Chinese revolution. Our Party paid attention to the peasant movement from the very beginning. The book records that Comrade Peng Pai had already launched the peasant movement in Guangdong as early as 1922.
The vast majority of our Party's outstanding leaders participated in and persisted in the arduous rural armed struggle for a long time, and trained themselves into brilliant military strategists. The arduousness of the environment of the Chinese revolutionary war was unprecedented in Chinese and foreign history. Only by bravely overcoming these unimaginable difficulties could there be today's victory in the people's revolutionary war. Comrade Ren Bishi was one of the main leaders of the Communist Party of China and one of the main leaders of the Chinese revolutionary war. The book also records materials about Comrades Liu Zhidan, Fang Zhimin, Zuo Quan, Guan Xiangying, Luo Binghui, Peng Xuefeng, Yang Jingyu, Ye Ting, and Li Zhaolin. They were all outstanding military strategists and brave and wise soldiers nurtured from the Chinese revolutionary war.
Like fraternal parties in other countries, the Communist Party of China has grown and strengthened in the struggle against various opportunisms within the Party. At the critical juncture of the revolution, the Party adhered to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's line, smashed the erroneous theories of all opportunists, capitulationists, and adventurists, and enabled the revolution to advance firmly in the correct direction. Comrades Ren Bishi and Qu Qiubai were fighters against Chen Duxiu's opportunism during the First Great Revolution. Their efforts reduced the losses of the failure of the Great Revolution and helped the Party's policy to turn around rapidly. Comrade Ren Bishi also waged a resolute struggle against dogmatists in the Xianggan Soviet Area, defending the Party and the Red Army in the Xianggan Soviet Area; during the 25,000-li Long March, he fought against the traitor Zhang Guotao, defending the Second and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army. Comrade Liu Zhidan persisted in the Shaanxi-Gansu revolutionary war and waged an irreconcilable struggle against "Left" and Right opportunists, creating the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, an advance base for resisting Japan. The achievements of these comrades are due to their correct study and understanding of Marxist-Leninist theory.
Chinese communists embody the greatest qualities of the revolutionary proletariat—the qualities of sacrificing themselves for the great ideals and for the fate of the people, and of calmly sacrificing themselves for justice. Our Party has produced countless martyrs who have dedicated themselves to the people and who have been brave and unyielding to the enemy. In the enemy's courts, prisons, and execution grounds, and under the enemy's barbaric and inhumane torture, they maintained the glorious title of Communist Party members. Comrades Li Dazhao, Yun Daiying, Cai Hesen, Wang Ruofei, Qu Qiubai, Xiang Jingyu, Fang Zhimin, Luo Dengxian, Deng Zhongxia, Peng Pai, Liu Hua, and Ye Ting are all such typical figures.
Hard work and tireless learning are also great qualities of communists. Under difficult conditions, not being afraid of trouble, not being afraid of setbacks, working and learning bit by bit with perseverance, this creative will is also worthy of our learning. Let us see from this book how Comrades Ren Bishi, Guan Xiangying, Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, and Zuo Quan studied and worked!
The blood of the martyrs was not shed in vain. Their lives contributed immortal feats to the revolution; their deaths inspired the revolutionary fighting spirit of the vast oppressed people. Today's victory of the Chinese revolution was cultivated by the sweat and blood of the martyrs. When we read this book, we should cherish the glory of the martyrs, remember the difficulty of the revolutionary victory, and strive with greater efforts to complete the unfulfilled wishes of the martyrs!

　　介绍《中国共产党烈士传》
    华应申编  青年出版社一九五一年五月增订重版
    周乃寂
    今年七月一日是中国共产党建党三十周年。青年出版社把华应申同志编的《中国共产党烈士传》增订重版，我们愿推荐这本书给读者，作为纪念这伟大节日的读物之一。
    在中国共产党艰苦奋斗的三十年中，曾有无数中华民族中的最好的战士，为共产主义的崇高理想和为中国人民的幸福前途而英勇牺牲。在他们身上，集中地表现了中国人民的伟大革命品质和智慧，也集中地表现了中国革命的艰辛的历史过程。革命烈士的传记是我们十分需要的读物，可惜这样的读物现在是太少了。本书因为是选录报刊上零碎发表的文字而成，所以还不能算是完整的传记，当然也不能包括所有的最值得纪念的革命先烈。而且本书中各篇文章写成于各个不同的时期，其中述及的个别史实也不免还有应加校正之处。编者至少应加上一些必要的注释才好。虽然如此，在目前，这本书还是值得细读的一本书。
    本书中包含关于二十三位先烈的材料。其中李大钊、任弼时、蔡和森、恽代英、瞿秋白、邓中夏、澎湃、王若飞等同志，都是中国最早的共产主义者。他们在五四运动的时候，由于目击到中国人民的苦难和国家的危殆，体会到中国旧民主主义的革命运动的失败的原因，终于认识到中国革命必须“走俄国人的路”，认识到只有工人阶级是真正革命的领导阶级，因而坚决地把自己投入工人阶级斗争的烈火中。他们在中国共产主义运动中起着先导的作用，留下了不朽的功绩。
    中国共产党的斗争，一开始就和中国工人运动结合在一起。我们党从工人阶级的斗争中培养了众多的革命领导者，例如领导中国职工运动和国际职工运动的苏兆征同志、邓中夏同志、邓发同志等，便都是这样的典型人物。
    以农民为主要参加者的革命战争，是中国革命胜利的重要关键。我们党一开始就注意到农民运动，本书中记述澎湃同志远在一九二二年已经在广东发动农民运动。
    我们党的绝大部分优秀的领导人都长期参加了和坚持了艰苦的农村武装斗争，并把自己锻炼成英明的军事家。中国革命战争的环境的艰苦，是中外历史上都没有的，只是英勇地克服了这些难以想像的困难，才能有今天人民革命战争的胜利。任弼时同志是中国共产党的主要领导者之一，也是中国革命战争的主要领导者之一。本书中还记述了关于刘志丹、方志敏、左权、关向应、罗炳辉、彭雪枫、杨靖宇、叶挺、李兆麟等同志的材料，他们都是从中国革命战争中养育出来的杰出的军事家和勇敢而英明的战士。
    中国共产党也和各国兄弟党一样，是在与党内各种机会主义的斗争中成长壮大起来的。党在革命的紧急关头，坚持着马克思列宁主义和毛泽东的路线，粉碎一切机会主义者，投降主义者、冒险主义者的错误的理论，使革命坚定地沿着正确的方向前进。任弼时、瞿秋白等同志，是第一次大革命时期反对陈独秀机会主义的战士，他们的努力减少了大革命失败的损失，有助于党的方针迅速扭转。任弼时同志又曾在湘赣苏区和党内教条主义者进行了坚决的斗争，保卫了湘赣苏区的党和红军；在二万五千里长征中，进行了反对叛徒张国焘的斗争，保卫了红二和红四方面军。刘志丹同志坚持陕甘革命战争，和“左”右机会主义者进行了不调和的斗争，开创了抗日前进根据地的陕甘宁边区。这些同志的功绩，就是由于他们正确地学习了、领会了马克思列宁主义理论的原故。
    中国共产党人体现着革命的无产阶级的最伟大的品质——为伟大的理想和为人民的命运而舍身犯难、从容就义的品质。我们党出现了无数对人民鞠躬尽瘁，对敌人英勇不屈的烈士，他们在敌人的法庭、监狱和刑场中，在敌人的野蛮的、惨无人道的酷刑下，保持了共产党员的光辉称号。李大钊、恽代英、蔡和森、王若飞、瞿秋白、向警予、方志敏、罗登贤、邓中夏、澎湃、刘华、叶挺等同志，便都是这样的典型人物。
    艰苦的工作和不倦的学习，也是共产党人的伟大品质。在艰难条件下，不怕麻烦、不怕挫折、一点一滴地锲而不舍地工作着和学习着，这种创造性的意志，也是值得我们学习的。让我们从本书中看看任弼时、关向应、王若飞、秦邦宪、左权等同志是怎样学习和工作的吧！
    烈士们的血不是白流的。他们的生，为革命贡献了不朽的劳绩；他们的死，振奋了广大被压迫人民的革命斗志。中国革命今天的胜利，是烈士们的汗和血培植出来的。我们读这本书时，应该缅怀先烈的光荣，记取革命胜利的不易，用更大的努力为完成烈士的遗志而奋斗！
