　　The Case of Comrade Wei Dongming Violating Railway Regulations

    The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has already handled it.
To the Editors:
    Regarding the matter of Wei Dongming, Secretary-General of Nanchang University, violating railway regulations, which was published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 9th, we have already investigated and dealt with it. Now we are sending you our decision on the punishment of Comrade Wei Dongming and Comrade Wei Dongming's written self-criticism for publication.
                                The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
            Decision on the Punishment of Comrade Wei Dongming for His Mistakes
    Comrade Wei Dongming is currently the Secretary-General of Nanchang University. On January 18th, he took a train to Wuhan on official business. After the train arrived at Pingxiang Station, Comrade Wei Dongming and Comrade Zhang, who was traveling with him, got off the train to walk around outside the station, and soon returned. After taking a dozen steps into the station, the ticket inspector Wang Jifa noticed them and asked them to stop to check their tickets. Comrade Zhang handed over his ticket for inspection, but Comrade Wei Dongming believed that Wang Jifa was "deliberately making things difficult," and refused to show his ticket, and said loudly, "We just came out of the station, didn't you see us?" Wang Jifa asked him to stop, but he ignored him, and instead told Wang Jifa to come on board to check his ticket. After boarding the train, Wang Jifa did not check Comrade Wei Dongming's ticket, nor did Comrade Wei Dongming take out his ticket for Wang Jifa to check, and both sides said the other's attitude was bad, which led to a dispute. Wei Dongming even asked for Wang Jifa's name, declaring that he would write a letter to Xu Xuehan, Director of the Shanghai Railway Administration. Later, the argument escalated, and Wei Dongming's guard and the railway police even drew their guns at each other. Although Comrade Wei Dongming stopped their actions, he continued to argue with Wang Jifa. Wang Jifa insisted that Wei Dongming get off the train, otherwise he would not start the train. Finally, Wei Dongming got off the train, but the train was already delayed by fifteen minutes. This incident caused dissatisfaction among all the passengers and had a very bad political impact.
    Comrade Wei Dongming is a responsible person in a higher education institution, and has received years of education from the Party and the people. However, he failed to set an example, abide by the rules and regulations of the People's Railway, and refused to obey the ticket inspector's check, which led to a dispute. Therefore, although Comrade Wei Dongming is not directly responsible for the train delay (because the right to start and stop the train rests with the station, and it is wrong for station staff to argue with passengers and refuse to start the train, causing a delay), the fact is that the train was not started due to the argument between the two parties; and Comrade Wei Dongming should bear the main responsibility for the cause of the argument. After the organization pointed out his mistakes, Comrade Wei Dongming admitted his mistakes and made a relatively profound self-criticism, which is good. In order to educate Comrade Wei Dongming and comrades with similar mistakes, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Provincial Party Committee has decided to give him a public warning. It is hoped that Comrade Wei Dongming will strive to correct his mistakes in thought and action in the future.

            Comrade Wei Dongming's Self-Criticism
    It was wrong of me not to abide by the railway regulations and to have a very bad attitude. In this public setting, I displayed self-righteousness and arrogance, which caused an unprincipled dispute. As a Party cadre, I should bear the main responsibility. This incident had a very bad impact on the masses, so I request the organization to give me the punishment I deserve.
    Neither the ticket inspector nor the entrance attendant asked for my ticket when I exited or entered the station. After I had gone quite a distance into the station, the ticket inspector asked for my ticket. Because I heard them talking among themselves, I guessed that they knew I had a ticket, so I did not walk back to the station entrance to present my ticket. This showed that I did not pay enough attention to station discipline. I was very impatient when I answered the ticket inspector, which caused Wang's dissatisfaction. He would not even look at Section Chief Zhang's ticket and chased after us onto the train. On the train, Wang questioned me about my attitude, and I failed to conduct self-criticism, but instead argued with him and asked for his name, which led to an escalation of the situation. If I had been humble and calm at the time, the dispute would have been quelled. It was not until the person in charge of the public security team came forward that I calmly explained what had happened and showed him my ticket. When Wang insisted that I get off the train, I got off the train immediately, which brought the dispute to an end; however, it had already delayed the departure time and created a bad impression among the masses.
    At the time, I thought that my bad attitude was a non-principled issue, but in reality, it has already caused serious consequences. This incident has given me a very profound lesson. In the future, I will make the greatest effort to overcome my shortcomings of arrogance, emotional impulsiveness, self-righteousness, and arrogance, and to be humble and cautious at all times and in all places.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　魏东明同志乘车违犯铁路规章案        
    中共江西省委纪律检查委员会已作处理编辑同志：
    二月九日人民日报《读者来信》栏所刊南昌大学秘书长魏东明违犯铁路规章的一事，我们已经调查处理。现把我们对魏东明同志的处分决定及魏东明同志的书面检讨寄上，请公布。
                                中共江西省委纪律检查委员会
            关于魏东明同志所犯错误的处分决定
    魏东明同志现任南昌大学秘书长。一月十八日，他因公乘火车赴武汉。火车到达萍乡站后，魏东明同志与同路的张同志下车出站散步，不久即返。进站十余步后，该站检票员王继发发觉，就叫他们停下，要检验他们的车票。张同志就将票交验；而魏东明同志认为王继发是“有意留难”，就不给验票，并高声说：“我们是刚才出站的，你不是看见的吗？”王继发要他站住，他不理，他要王继发上车验票。上车后，王继发既未检查魏东明同志的车票，魏东明同志亦未拿出车票给王继发检查，双方都说对方态度不好，引起争执。魏东明并问王继发姓名，声言要写信报告上海铁路管理局徐雪寒局长。后来，争吵更剧烈了，魏东明同志的警卫员和铁路警察竟出枪相持。魏东明同志虽制止了他们的行动，但仍继续和王继发争论。王继发坚持要魏东明下车，否则就不开车。最后，魏东明下了车，但是列车已误点十五分钟。这件事情，引起全车旅客不满，政治影响极坏。
    魏东明同志是高等学校的负责人员，受过党与人民多年的教育，而不能以身作则，遵守人民铁路的规章制度，不服从检票员的检查，以致引起纠纷。因此，虽然魏东明同志不负列车误点的直接责任（因为开车停车权在车站，车站人员与旅客争吵，就不开车，造成误点事故，这种做法是不对的），但由于双方争吵致使车站不开车则是事实；而争吵事件的起因应由魏东明同志负主要责任。魏东明同志经组织指出其错误后，已承认错误，并作了较深刻的检讨，这种精神是好的。为教育魏东明同志及有类似错误的同志，省委纪律检查委员会决定给予当众警告处分。希望魏东明同志今后在思想上和行动上努力改正自己的错误。
                      中国共产党江西省委员会纪律检查委员会
            魏东明同志的检讨
    我未遵守铁路规章，而且态度十分不好，这是错误的。在这种群众场合里，我表现自以为是、盛气凌人，因此惹起无原则纠纷，我身为党员干部，应负主要责任。这一事件在群众中影响很坏，因此我请求组织给我以应有的处分。
    我出站及入站时，检票员都没有要验票，等我进站很远，检票员向我要车票。我因听到他们中间谈论，猜想他们已知我有票，故未走回站口，缴验车票。这表现了我对车站纪律不够重视。我回答检票员的话时，表现了很不耐烦，因此引起王检票员的不满，连张科长的票也不肯看，追上车来。在车上王检票员质问我态度问题，我未能自我检讨，反而与他争论，并问他姓名，以致事态扩大。如果我当时态度谦虚冷静，是会使纠纷平息的。直到公安队负责人出面时，我才比较冷静地说明经过，并拿车票给他看。当王检票员坚持要我下车时我即行下车，才使纠纷告一段落；但已延迟行车时间，并在群众中造成不良影响。
    当时我以为我态度不好是一个非原则问题，但实际上这已引起严重后果。这一事件给了我很深刻的教训。我今后要用最大努力来克服傲慢自大、感情冲动、自以为是、盛气凌人的缺点，做到随时随地虚心谨慎。
                                                    魏东明
