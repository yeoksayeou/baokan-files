    Increase Production and Donate Rice to Buy Planes and Cannons to Support the Volunteer Army in Fiercely Fighting American Bandits
　　Anguo County Yang Basheng Mutual Aid Team
    Decides to Increase Production and Donate 5,000 Jin of Rice

    Editor:
    The Yang Basheng Mutual Aid Team in Shifo Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province, has decided to further increase production, practice strict economy, and donate 5,000 jin of millet to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After hearing the news that Wang Luohe, a labor model in the county, had donated 5,000 jin of millet to buy airplanes and cannons, the farmers of the Yang Basheng Mutual Aid Team immediately held a meeting of all team members to discuss how to respond to the donation of airplanes and cannons. Team member Zhao Xiaoluan said, "In the past, I was bullied by the Japanese devils, but today I live a peaceful life. To protect this peaceful life, we must first protect our country." Zhao Xiaoluan proposed hoeing and watering the cotton several more times, and applying 50 jin of bean cake fertilizer to each mu of cotton field, so that each mu of cotton field could yield dozens more jin of cotton. Since their entire team plants 105 mu of cotton, they can increase the production of seed cotton by more than 5,000 jin. In the sideline oil pressing production, in the past, three people could press 13 stacks of black bean cake per day; now they plan to press 18 stacks per day with three people. This way, they can produce 400 more jin of black bean cake and 35 jin of oil per day. Everyone feels that using this method of increasing production, increasing the income of 5,000 jin of rice is definitely not a problem.

    增加生产捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗
　　安国县杨八生互助组        
    决定增加生产捐米五千斤     编辑同志：
    河北省安国县石佛村杨八生互助组，决定更进一步增加生产，厉行节约，捐献小米五千斤，购买飞机大炮，支援中国人民志愿军。杨八生互助组的农民们听到本县劳动模范王洛合捐献五千斤小米购买飞机大炮的消息后，马上开全体组员会议，讨论响应捐献飞机大炮的办法。组员赵小乱说：“过去我受日本鬼子的欺压，今天过着安生日子。我们要保住这个安生日子，就得先把国家保好。”赵小乱提出，要把棉花多锄多浇几遍，一亩棉田上五十斤豆饼的追肥，使一亩棉田多收几十斤棉花。他们全组种了一百零五亩棉花，就可增产籽棉五千多斤。在副业打油生产上，过去三人每天打黑豆饼十三垛；现在准备每天三个人打十八垛。这样一天就可以多出四百斤黑豆饼，和三十五斤油。大家觉得用这种增加生产的办法，增加五千斤米的收入决不成问题。
