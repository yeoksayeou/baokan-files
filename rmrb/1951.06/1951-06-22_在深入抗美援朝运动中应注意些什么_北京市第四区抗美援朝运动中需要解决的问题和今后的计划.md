What to Pay Attention to in Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
--Problems to be Solved and Future Plans in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in the Fourth District of Beijing
Jin Jian, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Fourth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing

The Fourth District of Beijing has made preliminary achievements in popularizing the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement; on the basis of popularization, in accordance with the call of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea, a plan for deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement has been formulated.

Basically Achieved Popularization

From October of last year, when the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement began, until March of this year, the vast majority of street residents and scattered industry workers in the Fourth District, apart from government agencies, schools, and some factories, had not received Resist America, Aid Korea education. Starting in April of this year, the entire district launched a popularization campaign for the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. 12,568 workers throughout the district received one to ten rounds of propaganda, completely eliminating any blank spots among the working masses in various industries. Over four thousand industrial and commercial households and over five thousand vendors throughout the district also received one to five rounds of education. In total, including residents, the number of people in the district who received education was 173,573, accounting for 90 percent of the district's population.

After this popularized Resist America, Aid Korea education, the masses' political awareness has been raised a step further: they universally know why it is necessary to resist America and aid Korea, and the relationship between China and Korea is like that between lips and teeth, etc. From their personal experiences, they have realized the difference between their lives before and after liberation, which has further strengthened their love for Chairman Mao. They have theoretically recognized that American imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese people, and have initially established the idea of ​​hating American imperialism. They have strengthened their confidence in the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and know that American imperialism is a "paper tiger" and that the people, united, can defeat American imperialism.

The patriotic will and enthusiasm of the masses are also manifested in practical actions. People from all walks of life have signed patriotic pacts and donated money to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army (approximately 40 million yuan from mid-April to early June). Workers have improved output and quality in patriotic production competitions. Industrial and commercial households and residents collectively pay industrial and commercial taxes and real estate taxes. This movement has not only improved the political awareness of the masses, but also educated cadres and strengthened their mass perspective. For example, Comrade Xie Fang, the director of the 21st police station, said: "In future work, we must mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to do our work well."

Several Issues that Need to be Further Resolved

Although the masses' political awareness has been universally improved through this major movement, the following issues still need to be further strengthened or systematically educated: (1) They have a deep hatred for Japanese imperialism, but not a deep hatred for American imperialism. When the masses mention Japan, they all gnash their teeth and hate it; but when they mention the United States, although they all know that it is the enemy, they do not hate it as much as they hate Japan. (2) Although the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses has been stimulated and their political awareness has been improved, their understanding is mostly limited to perceptual understanding, starting from personal life. For example, their understanding of the motherland is mostly from aspects such as "life has improved after liberation, and we no longer eat mixed noodles" (of course, this is correct, but only seeing one point), and they cannot understand the motherland from the greatness of the motherland, the motherland's position in the world, and the motherland's beautiful and far-reaching future. (3) Failure to distinguish between the people of imperialist countries and imperialism; displaying narrow nationalist views. Some people think: "All foreigners are bad." (4) They do not understand the role and significance of concluding a five-power peace pact for imperialism and for their own people, they only know to sign for peace, and they only know that the people united can defeat imperialism. But they do not fully understand that the strength of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has surpassed the strength of the aggression camp headed by the United States.

Because the masses were not fully consulted and publicized when signing patriotic pacts, many masses do not understand their significance. For example, in Taiping Hutong, only seven of the 31 people who had signed patriotic pacts signed them after consultation and study, and the remaining 24 signed them under the circumstances of "the group leader mobilized and asked them to sign patriotic pacts." Among these 31 people, only two people (a teacher and a middle school student) understood the actual significance of signing a patriotic pact, only 12 people knew that they signed a patriotic pact in order to resist America and aid Korea, and the remaining 17 people did not know why. Only three people were concrete in content and could actually implement it; 18 people were abstract and vague, or mostly trivial matters of life, and not easy to implement. Ten people "signed a patriotic pact" but still did not know its content. This shows that there is still formalism in the implementation of patriotic pacts.

In the mass propaganda team, mass activists have too many concurrent positions and are overburdened. Some activists hold eight positions concurrently -- district representative, women's representative, health committee member, cultural and educational committee member, etc. It is common for them to hold four positions concurrently. However, they do not feel bitter about it, which shows that the masses have a high degree of awareness and enthusiasm. However, holding too many concurrent positions is bound to affect work.

Future Work Plan

On June 17, the Fourth District of Beijing held a temporary representative meeting of people from all walks of life to discuss and approve the work plan for promoting the three patriotic movements called for by the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea:

1.  Raise the political awareness of the masses a step further on the basis of their existing awareness. The main focus is to strengthen education on hating American imperialism and recognizing the bright future of the motherland, and to strengthen education on the inevitable victory of the world's peaceful forces and the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, in order to consolidate and improve the patriotic and internationalist thinking of the masses.

2. Conduct a universal education and inspection of the patriotic pacts to ensure that the signatories understand their significance. For those who have signed the pacts, revise them in response to the existing problems and shortcomings; for those who have not signed the pacts, give full play to democracy from the bottom up and universally sign them. The content of the pacts should be specific, combining both regular work and political tasks. In particular, donating weapons and treating the families of martyrs and soldiers well should be one of the important contents of the patriotic pacts. In order to conscientiously implement the patriotic pacts, each police station branch should establish a regular inspection system.

3. In order to promote the three major patriotic movements and regularize the propaganda work, it is decided: (1) To universally establish reading groups and podiums in factories, establish a current affairs quiz system, and strengthen leadership over propagandists and trade union propaganda teams. Vocational spare-time schools will regularize patriotic education. (2) Strengthen the leadership of the propaganda team, rectify the residents' propaganda team, adjust the concurrent positions of the propaganda team members, absorb new activists, expand the propaganda team, establish a system for imparting knowledge to propaganda team members, cultivate and improve the political awareness and working ability of the propaganda team members, and establish a working system for the propaganda team members, with division of labor and responsibility. Before the end of June, with the propaganda team members as the backbone, establish reading groups and broadcast listening groups with a focus. (3) Solve the problem of coordination between the propaganda team and various mass organizations. Resist America and Aid Korea propaganda will be uniformly led by the Resist America and Aid Korea branch, with various organizations responsible for their respective tasks and giving play to the role of various mass organizations. Strengthen the leadership of the industrial and commercial circles in learning.

4. In order to specifically promote the donation of weapons movement, it is decided: (1) In factories, according to the specific circumstances of each unit, the trade union will convene labor model, technology, and veteran meetings and trade union group meetings to carry out patriotic labor competitions, improve technology and quality, and use the bonus from exceeding production to donate weapons. In scattered industries, combine with the industry's business to improve management, save expenses and donate weapons. (2) In industry and commerce, call on industrial and commercial households to improve their operations and donate weapons. (3) Street residents will mainly donate weapons by participating in production and practicing economy.

5. In terms of treating the families of martyrs and soldiers well, it is decided: (1) First, mobilize government agencies, organizations, and schools to conduct a universal consolation visit to the families of martyrs and soldiers, and understand their living conditions and needs during the consolation visit. (2) Publicize the significance of treating the families of martyrs and soldiers well to the people of all walks of life in the district, and introduce the living conditions and needs of the families of martyrs and soldiers. (3) Call on people from all walks of life, and mobilize various mass organizations, to solve the difficulties of the families of martyrs and soldiers through various means -- such as helping with labor, preferential price reductions, introducing jobs, helping children enroll in school, etc. And mobilize the families of soldiers to write letters to the Volunteer Army, reporting on the treatment of the families of martyrs and soldiers in the rear, in order to encourage the fighting spirit of the People's Volunteer Army.

　　在深入抗美援朝运动中应注意些什么
    ——北京市第四区抗美援朝运动中需要解决的问题和今后的计划
   中共北京市第四区委员会宣传部长  金建
    北京市第四区普及抗美援朝运动已做出了初步成绩；在普及的基础上，根据抗美援朝总会的号召，订出了深入抗美援朝运动的计划。
  基本上做到了普及
    从去年十月抗美援朝运动展开后到今年三月，四区除机关、学校及部分工厂外，街道居民及各零散行业工人，绝大部分未受到抗美援朝教育。从今年四月份起，全区开展了一次普及抗美援朝运动，全区工人受到一次至十次宣传的有一万二千五百六十八人，完全消灭了各业工人群众中的空白点。全区四千余工商户，五千余摊贩，也都受到一次至五次的教育。总计连居民在内，全区受到教育的人数共有十七万三千五百七十三人，占全区人口的百分之九十。
    经过这次普及的抗美援朝教育，群众的政治认识已提高了一步：普遍地知道了为什么要抗美援朝，和中朝是唇齿相依的关系等。从切身生活的体验中觉察到解放前后生活的不同，也就更加增强了对毛主席的热爱。从道理上认识了美帝国主义是中国人民的敌人，初步地树立了仇恨美帝国主义的思想。加强了抗美援朝的胜利信心，知道了美帝国主义是“纸老虎”，人民团结起来就可以战胜美帝国主义。
    群众的爱国意志和热情，还表现在实际的行动中。各阶层人民纷纷订立爱国公约，捐款慰劳中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军（自四月中旬至六月初旬，约计四千万元）。工人在爱国主义生产竞赛中，已提高了产量、质量。工商户、居民则集体缴纳工商税及房地产税。这次运动不但提高了群众的政治认识，也教育了干部，加强了干部的群众观点。如二十一派出所所长谢昉同志表示：“在今后工作中要发动群众，依靠群众，把工作做好。”
  需要继续解决的几个问题
    群众的政治认识虽经过这次大运动已普遍地提高了，但在以下几个问题上，还需要继续加强或进行系统教育：（一）对日本帝国主义仇恨深，但对美帝国主义的仇恨不深。群众一提起日本，都咬牙切齿地痛恨；但提起美国，虽都知道是敌人，但总不像恨日本那样恨。（二）群众的爱国热情虽被激发，政治认识也提高了，但认识多限于感性的，从个人生活出发的。如对祖国的认识，则大半是从“解放后生活好了，不再吃混合面了”等方面出发（当然这是对的，但只看到一点），还不能从祖国的伟大，祖国在世界上的地位，祖国美好远大的前途等方面来认识祖国。（三）未能将帝国主义国家的人民，同帝国主义区别来看；表现了狭隘的民族主义的看法。有的认为：“凡是外国人都是坏的。”（四）不了解缔结五大国和平公约对帝国主义及对人民自己的作用和意义，只知道为了和平而签名，只知道人民团结起来，就可以战胜帝国主义。但不很了解以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量，已超过以美国为首的侵略阵营的力量。
    由于在订立爱国公约中，对群众没能进行充分的酝酿与宣传，不少群众还不了解其意义。如太平胡同，在已订爱国公约的三十一人中，经过酝酿学习后订立者仅有七人，其余二十四人都是在“组长动员，让订爱国公约”的情况下订立的。在这三十一人中，了解订立爱国公约实际意义的仅二人（一教员、一中学生），仅知道为了抗美援朝订立爱国公约者十二人，其余十七人则不知道为什么。在内容上具体而能切实执行者仅三人；订的抽象空洞，或多是生活琐事，不易执行者有十八人。“订了爱国公约”但还不知其内容者十人。这就说明，在推行爱国公约中还存在着形式主义的现象。
    在群众宣传队伍中，群众积极分子兼职过多，负担过重。有的积极分子，身兼八个职务——区代表、妇女代表、卫生委员、文教委员等，身兼四个职务者是普通的现象。但他（她）们并不嫌其苦，这就表现了群众已具有高度的觉悟和积极性。不过兼职过多也必然要影响工作。
  今后的工作计划
    六月十七日，北京市第四区举行了各界人民临时代表会议，讨论并通过推行抗美援朝总会号召的三项爱国运动的工作计划：
    一、把人民群众的政治认识从现有认识的基础上，提高一步。主要是加强仇视美帝国主义和认识祖国光明的前途的教育，加强世界和平力量必胜和中苏友谊合作的教育，以巩固和提高人民群众的爱国主义和国际主义思想。
    二、对爱国公约普遍进行一次教育和检查，务使订约者了解其意义。对已订约者要针对其存在的问题和缺点进行修订；对未订约者更要充分发扬民主，自下而上地普遍订立。公约内容要具体，既结合经常工作，又结合政治任务。特别是要将捐献武器和优待烈属、军属工作，作为爱国公约中重要内容之一。为了认真执行爱国公约，各派出所支会要建立定期的检查制度。
    三、为了推行三大爱国运动并将宣传工作经常化，决定：（一）在工厂普遍建立读报组，点将台，建立时事测验制度，加强对宣传员及工会宣传队的领导。职工业余学校将爱国主义教育经常化。（二）加强对宣传队的领导，整顿居民宣传队，调整宣传队员的兼职，吸收新的积极分子，扩大宣传队，建立对宣传队员的传授制度，培养与提高宣传队员的政治认识与工作能力，建立宣传队员的工作制度，分工包干。并于六月底以前，以宣传队员为骨干，有重点地建立读报组和广播收听组。（三）解决宣传队与各群众组织之间的配合问题。抗美援朝宣传由抗美援朝支会统一领导，各组织分工负责，发挥各群众组织的作用。对工商界学习的领导要加强。
    四、为了具体推动捐献武器运动，决定：（一）在工厂方面，根据各单位的具体情况，由工会召开劳动模范、技术、敬老等座谈会和工会小组会，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，改进技术、提高质量，用超额生产的奖金来捐献武器。在零散行业中，则结合本行业务，改进经营，节省开支捐献武器。（二）在工商业方面，号召工商户改善经营，捐献武器。（三）街道居民主要以参加生产、实行节约的方法捐献武器。
    五、在优待烈属、军属方面，决定：（一）首先发动机关、团体、学校对烈属军属进行一次普遍的慰问，在慰问中了解烈属军属的生活情况和需要。（二）向全区各阶层人民群众宣传优待烈属、军属的意义，介绍烈属、军属的生活状况和需要。（三）号召各阶层人民，并发动各种群众组织，通过各种方式——如帮助劳动、减价优待、介绍职业、帮助子弟入学等等，解决烈属军属的困难。并发动军属给志愿军写信，报告烈属军属在后方受优待的情形，以鼓舞人民志愿军的战斗情绪。
