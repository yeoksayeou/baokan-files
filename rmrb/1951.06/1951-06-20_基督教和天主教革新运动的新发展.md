New Developments in the Christian and Catholic Reform Movements
　　Lin Hong
    New developments have recently occurred in the reform movements of Christianity and Catholicism in China. Patriotic religious believers in many places have gathered to denounce the crimes of imperialists and their running dogs in using religion to invade our country, and have resolved to purge these scoundrels from the church and advance the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

    The "Conference on Handling Christian Organizations Accepting American Subsidies" convened by the Religious Affairs Department of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council in mid-April was of great significance to the development of the Christian and Catholic reform movements. The biggest gain of the conference was the demonstration, through concrete and vivid facts, that holding denunciation meetings for believers is an effective method for promoting the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Subsequently, the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of Chinese Christians Against American Aggression and Aiding Korea issued a notice on May 2, calling on Christian churches and organizations across the country to combine the communication of the spirit and resolutions of the "Conference on Handling Christian Organizations Accepting American Subsidies" with the widespread mobilization of believers to denounce imperialist elements in May. As of now, Christian believers in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Chongqing, Hefei, Chengdu, Kunming, Qiqihar, Luzhou and Zizhong in southern Sichuan, Guangyuan and Jiange in northern Sichuan, Runan and Shangqiu in Henan, Nanzhang in Hubei, Jianyang in Fujian, Ya'an in Xikang, and some ethnic minority areas have held denunciation meetings. Among them, the denunciation movement of Christians in Shanghai has developed relatively rapidly. After holding separate denunciation meetings, the various churches and organizations in the city jointly held a denunciation rally on the 10th of this month, attended by more than 10,000 staff, pastors, elders, and believers from various churches and organizations.

    At these denunciation meetings, many imperialist elements and their running dogs lurking within the church were exposed. Most of them had been lurking in China for a long time, colluding with Japanese invaders, sabotaging the War of Resistance Against Japan, or collecting intelligence for the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. After liberation, they continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, spread reactionary remarks, and sabotage the reform movement. Some of them even raped nurses, female workers, and female students. For example, the American imperialist element, Muder, single-handedly planned and formed the National Christian Council of China, using it to investigate China's political, economic, and social conditions. Every year, a large number of investigation and statistics materials from this organization were sent to Muder. The "Special Committee for Investigation and Occupation" under the association headed by American imperialist element, Shi Defu, was an institution specifically for stealing Chinese intelligence. From 1916, this "Special Committee for Investigation and Occupation" conducted investigations in nineteen provinces, mobilizing more than 5,000 foreign missionaries, with funding provided by the American capitalist, Rockefeller. The result of the investigation was the book "The Christian Occupation of China," completed in 1922. John Nance, an American pastor of the Jinan Christian Church, colluded with Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan and served as a liaison officer for the reactionary Kuomintang government in Chongqing and an advisor to bandit Wang Yaowu after the victory. During the Japanese bombing of Chongqing, another American pastor, Cory Kilvert, submitted maps to the Japanese military through the American Consulate, resulting in two arsenals being bombed dozens of times in succession. American pastors Pan Juemin and Wen Zhaomei in Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, consistently colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang to oppress the people. Wen Zhaomei raped his maid and three other Chinese women. Xu Chaozhen, the head of the reactionary Christian student association in Nanjing and a running dog of American imperialism, once prevented young students from joining military cadre schools, spreading the fallacy that Christians were "above politics" in order to sabotage the Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement.

    The ugly crimes of these imperialist elements and their running dogs were exposed at denunciation meetings in various places, and the patriotic believers present expressed their anger. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish them and expel them from China, and issued declarations expressing their support for the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, formulating patriotic covenants, and resolving to complete the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of Christianity through practical actions such as exposing and eliminating counter-revolutionary elements within the church and strengthening the study of current affairs and politics. At the denunciation meeting of more than 10,000 Christians in Shanghai, a resolution was passed on the spot, demanding that the People's Government punish the American imperialist elements Beffany, Moody, Zhuo Wei and their running dogs Chen Wenyuan and Gu Ren'en according to law. Jiang Changchuan, Bishop of the North China District of the Methodist Church in China, reviewed his mistake of performing baptism for Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit, and announced on the spot on behalf of the Methodist Church that Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit, and Song Meiling, the bandit, were expelled from the church. Many churches and organizations angrily removed the portraits of imperialist elements and their running dogs and hung the five-star red flag and Chairman Mao's portrait. The YMCA of Shanghai took down the portraits of the American imperialist element Muder and his running dog Liang Xiaochu. The Guangxuehui removed the photo of the American imperialist element Timothy Richard, the "founder" of the association. The Bible Society even notified the American imperialist element, Moody, that he was not allowed to enter the door of the Bible Society again. The Christian Publishing Association in Shanghai is actively assisting more than ten units, including Guangxuehui, which publishes religious books and periodicals, to examine all publications. They have decided that all books and periodicals that use religion to spread pro-American, fear-American, and friendly-American ideas, promote anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people ideas, and sabotage the Three-Self Patriotic Movement will be automatically discontinued. They have now discontinued the publication of more than one hundred reactionary books, including "New Commentary on Revelation" by the American imperialist element John Leighton Stuart.

    The Catholic reform movement in this period mainly involved protests by church organizations in various places against the crimes of Moroccan expatriate Li Peili residing in Nanjing in undermining the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, while Catholics in Tianjin denounced the Bishop of Tianjin Diocese, the imperialist element, Wen Guibin. These were two major events that shocked the Catholic community throughout the country. They enabled patriotic Catholics to further recognize the true face of imperialism and vigorously promoted the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. After the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church issued a patriotic declaration on March 31, the imperialist element Li Peili immediately wrote to the bishops of various districts, shamelessly slandering this as a "trick of the enemy," vainly attempting to sabotage the patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics. After this incident was revealed, it aroused the anger of Catholics and Christians in various places. Catholics in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Fuzhou, Jinan, GuiSui (Daxian, Guangyuan, and Suining in northern Sichuan), Ya'an in Xikang, and some areas in Northeast China gathered to protest Li Peili's shameless intimidation, unanimously demanding that the People's Government expel Li Peili, and telegrammed the Catholics in Nanjing to express their support for their just actions. More than 500 Catholics in Chongqing even held a protest demonstration for this. The Catholics of Aurora University in Shanghai established the "Committee to Protest Li Peili's Shameless Intimidation" and vowed to wage a resolute struggle against Li Peili. At the request of the broad masses of Catholics and people from all walks of life, the Shanghai Military Control Commission ordered the Catholic Church Affairs Promotion Committee, which was directly led and directed by Li Peili and used Catholicism for counter-revolutionary activities, to suspend all activities and await thorough investigation and handling.

    Catholics in Tianjin held a denunciation rally on May 16, denouncing the various crimes of the imperialist element Wen Guibin in opposing the Chinese people and undermining the patriotic reform movement of Chinese Catholics. This imperialist element, who was cloaked in religious garb, colluded with Japanese special agents during the War of Resistance Against Japan, stole intelligence on Chinese anti-Japanese base areas, and jointly planned with the Japanese invaders to attack Chinese anti-Japanese base areas; after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he assisted the international spy Lei Zhenyuan in establishing two special agent organizations, the "People's Construction Promotion Association" and the "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps," personally leading the reactionary organization "Our Lady's Service Group," and colluding with Li Peili to distribute pamphlets and secret documents that undermined the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. The reactionary "Statement of All Bishops of the Catholic Church in China" issued by the "Catholic Church Affairs Promotion Committee" in Shanghai was drafted by Wen Guibin himself. Because the evidence was conclusive, Wen Guibin had to admit his counter-revolutionary crimes, so the Tianjin People's Government accepted the demands of the Catholic masses and people from all walks of life and announced his expulsion from the country. This was a major victory for Catholics across the country in the anti-imperialist struggle.

    In addition, Catholics in Nanjing, Beijing, Xi'an, Shashi in Hubei, and Wuhu in southern Anhui also launched denunciation movements. Some Catholics have even automatically reported escaped counter-revolutionary elements to public security organs. For example, Wu Huaihui, who had engaged in espionage activities with the American spy Shang Jianxun in Zhangjiazhuang Catholic Church in Xian County, Hebei, fled to Shashi, Hubei in 1948 and continued to serve as a priest in the Catholic Church, but was finally reported by Catholics in the city in May of this year and has now been arrested by the local public security organs.

    Chinese Christians and Catholics have demonstrated a resolute and courageous spirit in the patriotic and anti-imperialist struggle. Their righteous actions have received the sympathy and support of the people throughout the country. On May 26, more than 80,000 people in Wuhan held a rally to denounce the crimes of American Bishop Xu Laide and Deputy Bishop Guo Shiji, leaders of the Wuchang Garden Mountain Catholic Church Nursery, in torturing infants. At this meeting, Catholics and non-Catholics jointly issued angry roars to avenge the children who died tragically at the hands of imperialist elements. On May 29, the Social Undertakings Group of the Nanjing Municipal People's Representative Consultative Committee held a special expanded meeting to study how to assist Catholics in better carrying out the reform movement. This shows that patriotic Catholics have stood on the same front as the people of the whole country against imperialist aggression, and imperialist special agents lurking within the church must be completely eliminated by the Chinese people in the future.

　　基督教和天主教革新运动的新发展
　　林洪
    中国基督教与天主教的革新运动最近已有新的发展。许多地方爱国的宗教信徒已纷纷集会控诉帝国主义者及其走狗利用宗教侵略我国的罪行，并决心把这些败类从教会中清洗出去，把三自革新运动推向前进。
    政务院文化教育委员会宗教事务处在四月中旬所召集的“处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议”，对于基督教与天主教革新运动的发展有很大意义。会议的最大收获，是用具体生动的事实证明了：开好教徒控诉会，是推动三自革新运动的有效方法。接着，中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹备委员会，于五月二日发出通告，号召全国基督教会与团体，在五月份结合传达“处理接受美国津贴的基督教团体会议”的精神与决议，广泛发动教徒控诉帝国主义分子。截至目前为止，上海、南京、济南、太原、重庆、合肥、成都、昆明、齐齐哈尔，川南的泸州、资中，川北的广元、剑阁，河南的汝南、商邱，湖北的南漳，福建的建阳，西康的雅安及某些少数民族地区的基督教徒都举行了控诉会。其中尤以上海基督徒的控诉运动发展得比较快。该市各教会团体在分别举行控诉会后，于本月十日联合举行了控诉大会，参加的有各教会、团体的工作人员、牧师、长老和教徒共一万多人。
    在这些控诉会上，许多潜伏在教会内部的帝国主义分子及其走狗都露出了原形。他们大多数是长期潜伏在中国，勾结过日寇，破坏过抗战，或为美蒋匪帮收集过情报。解放后他们仍然从事反革命活动，散布反动言论，破坏革新运动。他们中有的还强奸过护士、女工和女学生。例如美帝国主义分子穆德，曾一手策划组成中华全国基督教协进会，利用它来调查我国的政治、经济和社会情况。这个团体每年都有大批的调查统计材料送交穆德。在美帝国主义分子施德敷主持下的该协进会所属的“调查与占领特别委员会”，就是一个专门窃取中国情报的机构。从一九一六年起，这个“调查与占领特别委员会”在十九个省份进行了调查，动员外籍教士达五千多人，经费由美国大资本家洛克斐勒供给。调查的结果，就是一九二二年完成的“基督教占领中国”一书。济南基督教会美籍牧师那约翰，在抗日战争期间曾勾结日寇，抗战胜利后又充当重庆国民党反动政府的联络员和王匪耀武的顾问。在日寇滥炸重庆期间，另一美国牧师柯百里，曾通过美国领事馆向日本军部献交地图，结果使两个兵工厂连续遭受数十次轰炸。湖北南漳县美籍牧师潘觉民和闻照美，一贯勾结国民党匪帮欺压人民。闻照美曾强奸了他的女仆和另外三个中国妇女。美帝国主义的走狗、南京反动基督教徒学联负责人徐超尘，曾经阻止青年学生参加军事干部学校，散布基督教徒“超政治”的谬论，以破坏基督教三自革新运动。
    这些帝国主义分子及其走狗的丑恶罪行在各地的控诉会上被揭露后，与会的爱国教徒无不表示愤怒。他们一致要求人民政府予以严惩，把他们驱逐出中国去，并纷纷发表宣言，表示拥护三自革新运动，订立爱国公约，决以检举和肃清教会内的反革命分子，加强时事政治学习等实际行动，来完成基督教的三自革新运动。在上海基督徒一万多人的控诉会上，当场通过决议，要求人民政府依法惩办美帝国主义分子毕范宇、慕天恩、卓伟及其走狗陈文渊和顾仁恩等。中华基督教卫理公会华北教区会督江长川在会上检讨了他曾替蒋匪介石施行入教洗礼的错误，并代表卫理公会当场宣布，开除蒋匪介石和宋匪美龄的教籍。许多教会和团体愤怒地摘下了帝国主义分子及其走狗的画像，挂上了五星国旗和毛主席像。上海基督教青年协会拉下了美帝国主义分子穆德和他的走狗梁小初的画像。广学会摘下了该会“创始人”美帝国主义分子李提摩太的照片。圣经会更通知美帝国主义分子慕天恩，不准再进圣经会的大门。在上海的基督教出版协会，正积极协助出版宗教书刊的广学会等十多个单位检查所有的出版物。他们已决定，凡利用宗教散布崇美、恐美和亲美思想，宣传反苏反共反人民以及破坏三自革新运动的书刊，一律自动停止发行。他们现已将美帝国主义分子司徒雷登所作的“启示录新注释”等反动书刊一百多种停止发行。
    天主教的革新运动，这一时期主要是各地教会团体抗议居住在南京的摩洛哥侨民黎培里破坏三自革新运动的罪恶行为，天津天主教徒则控诉了天津教区主教帝国主义分子文贵宾。这是震动全国天主教界的两件大事，它们使爱国教徒进一步认清了帝国主义的真面目，有力地推动了三自革新运动。当三月三十一日天主教南京教区发表了爱国宣言后，帝国主义分子黎培里立即写信给各区主教，无耻地污蔑这是“敌人的诡计”，妄想破坏中国教徒的爱国运动。这一件事被揭露后，激起了各地天主教和基督教教徒的愤怒。上海、天津、北京、重庆、兰州、福州、济南、归绥（川北的达县、广元、遂宁）西康的雅安和东北某些地区的教徒都纷纷集会，抗议黎培里的无耻恫吓，一致要求人民政府把黎培里驱逐出境，并致电南京天主教徒声援他们的正义行动。重庆五百多天主教徒更为此举行了抗议示威游行。上海震旦大学的天主教徒成立了“抗议黎培里无耻恫吓委员会”，要与黎培里作坚决斗争。在广大教徒和各界人民的要求下，上海市军事管制委员会已命令由黎培里直接领导指挥的、借天主教作反革命活动的天主教教务协进委员会停止一切活动，并听候彻查处理。
    天津天主教徒在五月十六日举行控诉大会，控诉了帝国主义分子文贵宾反对中国人民、破坏中国天主教徒革新爱国运动的各种罪恶行为。这个披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子，在抗战期间曾经勾结日本特务，窃取中国抗日根据地的情报，与日寇共同策划进攻中国抗日根据地；抗战胜利后，又协助国际间谍雷震远成立了“民众建国协进会”和“公教青年报国团”两个特务组织，亲自领导反动组织“圣母御侍团”，并与黎培里勾结，散发破坏三自革新运动的小册子和秘密文件。由上海“天主教教务协进委员会”发出的反动的“中国天主教全体主教声明”，就是文贵宾亲自起草的。因为证据确实，文贵宾不得不承认他的反革命的罪恶，于是天津人民政府接受天主教徒群众和各界人民的要求，宣布将他驱逐出境。这是全国教徒在反帝国主义斗争中所获得的一大胜利。
    此外，南京、北京、西安、湖北的沙市、皖南的芜湖等地的天主教徒也展开了控诉运动。有的地方的天主教徒还自动向公安机关检举了在逃的反革命分子。如曾在河北献县张家庄天主教堂与美国间谍尚建勋共同进行特务活动的吴怀辉，于一九四八年逃到湖北沙市，继续在天主教会充当神甫，但在今年五月终被该市教徒检举出来，现已为当地公安机关逮捕。
    中国基督教徒与天主教徒在爱国反帝斗争中，已经表现了坚决勇敢的精神。他们的这一正义行动已得到了全国人民的同情和支援。五月二十六日，武汉市八万余人举行集会控诉武昌花园山天主堂育婴堂领导人美籍主教徐赉德和副主教郭时济残害婴儿的罪行，在这个大会上教徒与非教徒共同发出了为惨死在帝国主义分子魔手下的儿童复仇的怒吼。五月二十九日，南京市各界人民代表协商委员会社会事业组特别举行扩大会议，专门研究如何协助教徒更好地开展革新运动。这就说明：爱国教徒已经和全国人民站在反对帝国主义侵略的一条战线上，潜伏在教会内部的帝国主义特务分子，今后一定要被中国人民全部清除出去。
