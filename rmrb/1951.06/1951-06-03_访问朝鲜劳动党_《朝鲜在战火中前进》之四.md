　　Visiting the Korean Workers' Party
    ——"Korea Advances in the Flames of War" (Part Four)
     Liu Baiyu

    I visited the Workers' Party during the fierce battles on the Han River front.

    Underground, the winding tunnels resembled the command post on the front lines. The roar of bombs was like the continuous artillery fire coming from the Han River. The war tightly linked the front and the rear. Every Korean person, every member of the Korean Workers' Party, and the Workers' Party Central Headquarters leading the struggle, who dared to brave the flames on the front lines, leaping towards the enemy for the sake of their country, were closely connected. The important fact is that the dawn of victory has already appeared along with this resolute struggle. Underground, the electric lights flickered, their light appearing so lovely and warm, shining on Comrade Pak Chong-ae, Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Korean Workers' Party, sitting opposite us. She was such a kind person, always smiling, but that smile expressed boundless confidence in the struggle. I believe that peace-loving people all over the world know her. Recently, she received the honor of the Stalin International Peace Prize for her efforts in the struggle at the forefront of defending world peace. Pak Chong-ae is a figure who forever symbolizes peace. The first time I saw her was at the Chinese People's Conference for the Defense of World Peace on October 2, 1949. On that platform, high above which hung Picasso's white dove of peace, she was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people with sustained applause. But now, she is here, in a city filled with ashes, flames, and the blood of the people, talking to us. She is still wearing the simple Korean national dress with a long skirt. All of this vividly tells us the relationship between peace and struggle: only through struggle can peace be achieved.

    It was 5:30 PM on February 21, 1951. Comrade Pak Chong-ae stood up and said:

    "On behalf of the Workers' Party, I pay my respects to the Chinese artists, especially those who have come to Korea amidst the war!"

    She continued, "Under such complex war circumstances, you can witness firsthand the brutal crimes of the American aggressors. You will have a deep understanding of the Workers' Party, which serves the interests of the people. What the Korean people want is a peacefully unified fatherland. To strive for the realization of a peacefully unified fatherland, the Workers' Party has done everything possible, striving to achieve this goal through the Fatherland United Democratic Front. Under the leadership of the Party, all organs and all Party members have been working hard for this goal. However, in order to achieve its aggressive aims, American imperialism launched the Korean War. The traitorous bandit Syngman Rhee provoked this war on June 25, 1950. When the war began, the Workers' Party mobilized all the people and all its strength to lead and call on the people to defend their fatherland and strive for final victory. The members of the Workers' Party have always stood at the forefront of this struggle. In the future, the Workers' Party will certainly strive for victory until the end."

    Her words were concise and powerful, and they connected with the entire struggle of Korea. She then introduced Comrade Park Chang-ok, Minister of Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Party, to answer our questions. Thus, I heard Minister Park Chang-ok's voice, which had become slightly hoarse but filled with boundless enthusiasm and determination during those tense days of struggle. Now, from the questions we asked, I am excerpting a portion here for publication.

    People all over the world are watching Korea's present and concerned about Korea's future. Now let us understand how the Workers' Party is leading and organizing this just war towards victory.

    He said: "After the outbreak of the war, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung issued letters to all the Korean people and to the entire Party, calling on everyone to change to a wartime system, to change all production to wartime production. The Party put all its strength into strengthening the army, strengthening the front lines, and putting all its strength into the war to ensure the unification of the fatherland. This war is the most brutal war in human history. The enemy is brutal and powerful. Korea had long suffered under Japanese imperialist rule in the past, but at that time the imperialists did not have such power as the current enemy. Therefore, this is a fierce battle and a bitter struggle.

    "The people of North Korea, after five years of building up the army, bravely resisted the enemy attacking us at the beginning of the war and quickly moved to the counter-offensive.

    "The Korean people showed great enthusiasm and support in the war. When the People's Army occupied Daegu and approached the Nakdong River, the Korean people ensured that not a single station was destroyed along the long transportation line from the Yalu River to the Nakdong River. That is not to say that the enemy did not carry out brutal bombings, but that the Korean workers were so heroic that if it was destroyed here one day, it would be restored here the next day. But relying solely on railway transportation was not enough. The front lines urgently needed ammunition. Thus, within the long distance from Pyongyang to the front lines of the Nakdong River, regardless of how enemy planes bombed and strafed, the Korean people, averaging 170,000 people every day, regardless of gender, relied on their hands and shoulders to transport ammunition upwards. This is a concrete fact of how the Party organized the people and concentrated all their strength on the war."

    As I listened carefully to his talk, I thought of the fierce battle being waged on the Han River front, and I also quickly thought of every ordinary Korean I was familiar with in those rural villages. I remembered that Korean mother, the look of glory on her face when she spoke of being a member of the Workers' Party. The Americans made the Korean people bleed, and first massacred Workers' Party members by the hundreds and thousands, but blood could never tarnish the title of Workers' Party member. In the life-and-death struggle, blood made this title even more glorious. Just like what that ordinary farmer wrote to his Workers' Party member brother before sacrificing himself: "This road - the road of non-surrender - is what you told me." The Workers' Party has become the vanguard in the Korean people's struggle. The Workers' Party experienced five years of peaceful construction and is now experiencing a new test of war, and it is advancing with boundless vigor. In the war, it has shown itself to be so tenacious and so heroic.

    "When the People's Army liberated Seoul, the enemy destroyed the bridges over the Han River to prevent us from advancing."

    What to do? Advancing absolutely cannot be stopped. The enemy was on the other side of the Han River, and the enemy bombers were attacking day and night, not allowing you to repair the bridge.

    At this time, the Workers' Party members resolutely swore: "We must get this bridge through! If we can't repair it, we will use our corpses as bridges to let our people pass!"

    They stood up and heroically rushed onto the bridge, but under the enemy's tight fire net, they fell one after another. After two hours, most of those who rushed up were killed or wounded. Those who died fulfilled their promise, tightly gripping the bridge with both hands to flatten the bridge foundation with their bodies so that tanks could pass over it.

    A battalion following behind them was about to attack forward, stepping on the remains of the sacrificed. Their urgent task was to seize the bridgehead fortress on the other side of the river to cover the crossing.

    The enemy used all kinds of firepower to block the bridge as fiercely as a storm. Even the river water under the bridge was boiling from the explosions. But such a steel battalion, 70 percent of which were glorious Workers' Party members, finally passed through the bridge. However, only nine people remained on the south bank. The heroic battalion commander led them with a machine gun. Look! They finally rushed out of the flames and reached the south bank of the Han River. However, not long after arriving, the battalion commander sacrificed himself. Another soldier was wounded, and he only had one arm and one leg to use, but he still insisted on fighting. Looking at the watch and calculating the time, according to the commander's order: they should hold this small bridgehead for another thirty minutes. But, you know, in such a critical situation, how long thirty minutes is! But in the blink of an eye, three more comrades heroically sacrificed themselves, leaving six people. They discussed it and decided to send someone back across the bridge to report to the commander that they would resolutely guarantee to hold on for thirty minutes, hoping that the follow-up troops would catch up quickly. But who should go? Who would rush through the flames again? At this time, the wounded comrade said:

    "You are all still healthy and can fight. Let me go!"

    The bridge was a sea of flames, impossible to pass. He jumped into the Han River. The Han River was turbulent. He swam hard while bleeding. He finally swam across the Han River. He reached the regimental headquarters. He saw the regimental commander. He reported the determination of the comrades on the south bank. Finally, he sacrificed himself gloriously and peacefully in his own regimental headquarters. Let us always remember this Workers' Party member! When he finished his last sentence and lowered his head, the troops had already surged through the Han River bridge and rushed towards the enemy south of the Han River.

    I was listening, but I could hardly hear the speaker's strong, deep voice. What I seemed to hear was the sound of that comrade making his final report to the regimental headquarters. At this time, Minister Park Chang-ok paused slightly, and then he continued: "The front line advanced victoriously... The front line urgently needed artillery shells, but the artillery shells were still far in the rear at that time. Should we rush them up? We can't walk during the day! The enemy planes won't give you any time. If we only rely on walking at night, it will be too late. Comrades! What should we do then?" At this time, the people supporting the front line in the rear raised a sharp question."

    The railway district party committee in one area convened a party meeting at this urgent moment. He proposed:

    "In order to support the front line, who is willing to drive the train during the day - right in the daytime - to rush the supplies up?"

    As soon as the question was raised, all the party members stood up and asked to go. As a result, three comrades were selected from the middle to take on this glorious, arduous, and extremely dangerous transportation task.

    The ammunition train set off. After passing two stations, American planes came roaring in. This train running during the day scared the enemy. The American bombers thought that there would be no signs of anything on Korean soil during the day! How could there be a train?! They swooped down and fired relentlessly, but every time they swooped down, the train suddenly slowed down or stopped. After the plane passed, the train sped forward again. The enemy became angry, made a spin, but still didn't catch up. The train continued to spew black smoke and advance bravely. The three comrades on the locomotive only considered one issue: "Get it up there!" But "the last two cars are troops rushing to the front line! How to protect them? There is a cave ahead! Can we drive in? Yes! But counting the cars, the train is so long that if we don't leave the locomotive out of the cave, we will have to leave the last two cars out of the cave. What should we do?" Time was urgent. They quickly made a decision. They would rather sacrifice themselves and push the rear cars into the cave with all their strength. They did this happily. The locomotive went forward. The enemy plane strafed. Bullets flashed and hit the locomotive. A driver comrade fell and sacrificed himself at his post. The second immediately rushed up and continued to control the locomotive. The locomotive was still moving forward. "Finally, they guaranteed the supply to the front."

    These are not two ordinary stories. From them, we see the quality of a Korean Workers' Party member, the relationship between a Workers' Party member and the entire Party, and the relationship between a Workers' Party member and the war. Perhaps some readers will ask: Who are they? The person who died holding the bridge, the person who swam across the Han River wounded, the person who drove the train to the front regardless of everything, what are their names? How can I tell you? There are many such nameless heroes. I know they have a common name known all over the world, and that is Communist.

    Minister Park Chang-ok looked at us and said:

    "On the front lines, Workers' Party members are always at the forefront, and now there are more and more. Even ordinary soldiers write their applications to join the Party before charging into battle. Communists all over the world are like this. Whether it is offense or retreat, they are at the forefront of difficulties and hardships. This can be seen everywhere. In the Korean Fatherland War, no matter how difficult it is, the people's confidence in the Party is always firm, and in the most difficult times, the Korean people know that they are not isolated. The Soviet and Chinese people are with them, opposing unjust wars. This is the decisive force for the victory of a just war."

    If the General Political Bureau of the People's Army had not been constantly calling and if another appointment time had not arrived, this conversation would not have ended for a while.

    Minister Park Chang-ok smiled, stood up, and had just returned from a meeting of peasant enthusiasts. He kindly told me: "The Korean people are very concerned about Chairman Mao. Our Central Bureau received letters asking about his health. This time, at the enthusiasts' meeting, more people asked about Chairman Mao." We stood up and shook hands tightly and warmly.

    Park Chong-ae, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, finally solemnly handed us a package of letters. She said:

    "This is a gift from Korean women to Chinese women!"

    It turned out that this package contained fiery enthusiasm. These are letters written by countless fighting Korean women, the sincere words of countless sisters. One of them was written by Li Yantian of the Yuan Mountain People's Committee. She wrote: "...You have sent your most beloved husbands and sons to the Korean front lines. They are fighting side by side with our husbands and sons to drive away American imperialism. Wherever they go, there is victory..." Let us always remember these heartfelt actions and words of the Chinese and Korean people! Because she is the most glorious action and the loudest language in the world.

    We said goodbye to this place. As we walked along the underground corridor and onto the ground, I simply couldn't describe my emotions. I felt that a person can live for a hundred hours and not live a fulfilling life, but a person can get more fulfillment in an hour than anything else, and that is when you are tightly combined with the fiery struggle and tightly combined with the heroic people in the fiery struggle. When we got to the ground, we learned that the first spring rain had fallen in Korea. The rain was heavy and would soon soak us, but in my heart, I was suddenly so excited that spring had truly arrived in Korea. No matter how the gasoline bombs burned, the farmers would always sow in the fields. The sky was pitch black and filled with the sound of rain. Comrade Park Chong-ae and all the comrades rushed out, countless hands repeatedly shaking, shaking, and saying goodbye. At this time, the war alarm suddenly appeared in the dark sky, and the blue light of a flare suddenly flashed, and then went out. At this time, a torrential rain shrouded the ground with white smoke. Our car started. I turned back in the vast fog and saw Comrade Park Chong-ae and his comrades standing there waving their hands, like the entire Korean people standing in the war storm, bravely and smilingly waving their hands to the Chinese people. When I finally passed through the ruins and wartime streets, a solemn thought appeared in our minds: At night, as you move forward and enter every Korean city, in that piece of ruins, you will suddenly see a Korean person holding a flag and directing the direction of advance. The city is often illuminated by a sea of fire, planes are constantly circling, and sometimes, six or seven flares light up at once, preparing to drop another batch of bombs here at any time. Trucks are also often congested at intersections. You feel nervous and dangerous there. You hope to pass through this target-concentrated city as soon as possible, but the person guarding this post is so firmly shaking his flag and carrying out his mission. How admirable! This is simply a sea of fire, and he is sticking to it day and night, never leaving the sea of fire, always pointing the direction of advance. This profound impression often suddenly appeared in my mind again and again. From those firm individuals, I thought of the entire Korea. In the most important position in this Korea that is fighting for peace and happiness, the Korean Workers' Party, heroically holding the banner of struggle, stands upright there, always pointing the direction of advance.

　　访问朝鲜劳动党
     ——《朝鲜在战火中前进》之四
      刘白羽
    我访问劳动党，是在汉江前线激战的时日里。
    在地底下，曲折的地下道很像火线上的指挥部，炸弹的轰响正如汉江上传来不停的炮声，战争把前线与后方紧紧联成一片。每一个敢在火线上冒着喷射的火焰，为了祖国而跳跃着向敌人冲击的朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党员和领导斗争的劳动党中央首脑部，那是紧密相联的。重要的事实是胜利的曙光已经随同这种坚决的斗争而出现了，在地底下，电灯闪着光芒，这光芒显得那样可爱而温暖，这光芒照着坐在我们对面的朝鲜劳动党中央书记局书记朴正爱同志，她是那样慈祥的一个人，她永远那样微笑着，但这微笑表示着无限斗争的信心。我相信全世界爱好和平的人民是没有不知道她的，最近她已经由于她在保卫世界和平前线斗争的努力而获得了斯大林国际和平奖金的荣誉。朴正爱是一个永远象征着和平的人物，我第一次看见她是在一九四九年十月二日中国保卫世界和平大会上，在那高悬着毕加索白色和平鸽的讲坛上，她被中国人民经久不息的掌声热烈欢迎着。但现在，她在这里，在充满火烬、火焰与人民鲜血的城市里和我们谈话，她还是穿着素净的带长裙的朝鲜民族服。这一切鲜明地告诉我们：和平与斗争的关系，只有斗争才能获得和平。
    这是一九五一年二月二十一日下午五点半钟，朴正爱同志站起来说：
    “我代表劳动党，向中国艺术工作者，尤其是在战争之中来到朝鲜的中国艺术工作者致敬！”
    她继续说：“在这样战争复杂的情况之下，你们可以亲眼看见美国侵略者的残暴罪行。你们对于劳动党是会深刻了解的，劳动党是为人民利益而服务的。朝鲜人民要求的是一个和平统一的祖国，为了争取和平统一祖国的实现，劳动党曾经尽了一切力量，通过祖国民族统一战线，力求达到这个目的，在党的领导下，所有机关，所有党员都为这个目的而努力奋斗。可是美帝国主义为了要达到侵略目的，爆发了朝鲜战争。卖国匪徒李承晚，在一九五○年六月二十五日挑拨起这个战争。战争开始了，劳动党便以全体人民一切力量，领导号召人民保卫自己的祖国，争取最后胜利，劳动党的党员们在这斗争的任务中始终站在最前面的，今后劳动党一定争取胜利到底。”
    她的话简洁而有力，她的话联系着整个朝鲜的斗争。她随即介绍党中央宣传部长朴昌玉同志来回答我们的访问。于是我又听见朴昌玉部长在那紧张斗争时日，已经变得微微有些沙哑但充满无限热情，充满无限坚决的声音。现在，从我们所访问的问题中，我摘录其中一部分在这里发表。
    全世界人民都在注视着朝鲜的现在，关心着朝鲜的未来。现在我们就来了解一下劳动党是怎样领导组织这个正义的战争走向胜利。
    他说：“战争爆发以后，劳动党中央委员会和金日成将军都发表了告全朝鲜人民，告全党的信，号召一切改变为战时体制，一切生产改变为战时生产，党把一切力量来强化军队，加强前线，把一切力量投入为了保证祖国统一的战争里面去。这个战争是人类历史以来未有过的残酷战争。敌人是残暴而有力的，朝鲜过去长期遭受日本帝国主义统治，但那时帝国主义是没有现在敌人这样力量的，因此这是一个恶战与苦斗。
    “北朝鲜人民经过五年建军，在战争初期，就勇敢地抵抗了向我们进攻的敌人，迅速转入反攻。
    “朝鲜人民在战争中表现了巨大的热情和支援，当人民军占领大邱，直迫洛东江的时候，从鸭绿江到洛东江遥远的运输线上，朝鲜人民保证了没有一个车站被毁坏，那不是说敌人没有残暴地进行轰炸，而是朝鲜的工人是那样英勇，前一天这里破坏了，第二天这里就恢复了。但是光靠铁路运输还不够，前线十分迫切地需要弹药，于是从平壤到洛东江前线的遥远距离之内，不管敌人飞机怎样轰炸扫射，朝鲜人民每天平均有十七万人不分男女凭靠着双手双肩，向上运输弹药，这是党组织了人民，以一切力量都集中到战争上来的具体事实。”
    当我仔细地听着他的谈话时，我想到在汉江前线正在进行的激烈战斗，我也迅速地想到我所熟悉的那些农村里的每一个普通朝鲜人，我记起那个朝鲜母亲，当她讲到她是一个劳动党员时，那幅光辉荣耀的面色。美国人使朝鲜人民流血，并首先成百成千的残杀着劳动党员，可是血水绝不能染污劳动党员的称号，在生死斗争中，血水使这称号更光辉了。正如同那个普通农民在牺牲以前，写给他那劳动党员哥哥的话：“这条路——不屈服的路，是你告诉我的。”劳动党成为朝鲜人民斗争中的先锋队。劳动党经历了五年和平建设又在经历着新的战争考验，而它带有无限的朝气在前进。她在战争中显露出她是那样顽强，那样英勇。
    “当人民军解放了汉城的时候，敌人为了阻止我们前进，破坏了汉江上的桥梁。”
    这怎么办呢？前进可是绝对不能停止的。敌人就在汉江的那面，加上敌人的轰炸机日夜不停地来袭击，他不允许你去修这座桥梁。
    这个时候，劳动党员们坚决地宣誓了：“一定要修通这座桥！修不好就用我们的尸体当作桥梁，也要让我们的人通过去！”
    他们站起来，英勇地扑上桥梁去了，可是在敌人严密的火网下，他们前仆后继，经过两小时，冲上去的大部伤亡了，死了的他们实践了他们的诺言，两手紧紧抓住桥梁，好把自己尸体垫平桥基，让坦克从上面过去。
    跟随在他们后面的一个营这时就要踏着牺牲者的遗体攻击前进了，他们的紧急任务是去抢占江那面的桥头堡垒，掩护渡江。
    敌人使用各种火力，如同一片风雨一样猛力封锁桥梁，连桥下的江水都炸得沸腾起来。但是这样一个钢铁营，全营百分之七十是光荣的劳动党员，他们终于通过了这座桥梁，可是到了南岸的只剩下九个人，英雄的营长率领着他们，带着一挺机关枪，看呀！他们终于从火焰里面冲过去了，到了汉江南岸。可是，过去不久，营长就牺牲了，另外一个战士负了伤，他只剩了一只胳臂一只腿能用，也还在坚持奋战。看看表，算一算时间，按照指挥官的命令：还有三十分钟时间，他们应该坚持住这小小的桥头堡垒，可是，你知道，在这样危急情势下，这三十分钟是多么悠长的时间啊！但是就在这一转眼的工夫，又有三个同志英勇牺牲了，剩下了六个人。他们商议了一下，决定派一个人再从桥上回去报告指挥官，他们一定坚决保证坚持三十分钟，希望后续部队快快赶上来。可是谁去呢？谁再从那火焰里面冲过去呢？这时那个负伤的同志说：
    “你们还都健全，还能作战，让我去罢！”
    桥梁上一片火焰，无法通过，他踊身跳下了汉江，汉江一片涛涛，他一面流血，一面奋力游着，他终于游过了汉江，他到达了团部，他看见团长，他报告了江南的同志们的决心，最后他就在自己的团部里，光荣地、安然地牺牲了，让我们永远记住这个劳动党员吧！当他最后一句话说完，低垂了头，部队已经汹涌的通过汉江桥，扑向汉江以南的敌人了。
    我听着，但我几乎没有听见讲话人那粗壮的深沉的声音，我听到的似乎是那个同志最后向团部做报告的声响。这时，朴昌玉部长稍稍停了一下，然后他继续说：“战线胜利地向前进展了……前线十分急需炮弹，可是炮弹那时还在远远的后方，向上抢运吧？白天不能走路！敌人飞机群一点时间也不给你，要是只靠夜晚走，那就来不及了。同志们！这又怎么办呢？这时后方支援前线的人提出了尖锐的问题。”
    一个地区的铁路区党委，就在这个急迫的时候，召集了党的会议，他提出：
    “为了支援前线，谁愿意白天——就在白天开火车抢运上去。”
    问题一提出，全部党员都站起来要求去，结果从中间选了三个同志担当了这个光荣艰巨而危险万分的运输任务。
    弹药列车开出去了，过了两站，美国飞机就轰轰响着来了，这列白天驶行的火车倒把敌人吓着了，美国轰炸手们以为白天朝鲜的土地上是不会有任何踪影的！怎么有这一列火车呀？！他们便一点也不放松地俯冲了、射击了，可是每一次它俯冲下来，火车便骤然放慢或者停止，飞机开过去了，列车又向前猛力奔驰。敌人恼怒起来了，打了一个旋，可是又没有扑住，列车就那样喷着黑烟，猛勇前进。机车上的三个同志只考虑着一个问题“运上去！”可是“最后两节车厢里是紧急赶上前线去的部队呀！怎样保护他们呢？前面就是一座山洞了！可以开进去？对！可是数一数车厢，列车是那样长，要不是把前面机车露在洞外，就要把后面的两节车厢露在洞外，这怎么办呢？”时间急迫，他们迅速作了决定，他们宁愿自己牺牲而把后尾的车厢用力地泄进山洞，他们愉快地这样做了。机车向前面去了，敌机扫射了，子弹闪着火光打过机车，一个司机同志仆倒，在他的岗位上牺牲了，第二个立刻抢上去，继续掌握着机车，机车还在前行。“最后他们终于保证了前方的供应。”
    这不是两则平常的故事，我们从他们看到一个朝鲜劳动党员的品质，一个劳动党员和整个党的关系，一个劳动党员和战争的关系。也许有的读者要问：他是谁呢？那个死了把手抓住桥梁的人，那个负了伤泅过汉江的人，那个不顾一切把列车开向前方的人，他的姓名呢？我怎样告诉你呢？像这样无名的英雄多得很，我知道他们有一个共同的、全世界都知晓的名字，那就是共产主义者。
    朴昌玉部长两眼望着我们说：
    “在前线，劳动党党员经常在最前面的，现在愈来愈多了，就是普通的战士，在冲锋之前，他也写了他的入党志愿书。全世界的共产党人都是如此，无论是进攻，无论是后退，他们都是在艰难困苦的最前面的，这是处处都可以看出来的，在朝鲜祖国战争中，不管怎样困难，人民对党的信心永远是坚决的，而最困难的时候，朝鲜人民知道他们并不是孤立的，苏联和中国人民同他们在一起，反对非正义的战争，这是正义战争胜利的决定力量。”
    要不是人民军总政治局不断打来电话，要不是另外的约会时间已经到达，这一席谈话是一时不会结束的。
    朴昌玉部长笑了，他站起来，他刚刚从农民热诚分子集会上回来，他亲切地告诉我：“朝鲜人民非常关心毛主席，我们中央局就收到这样的信问候他的健康，这一次在热诚分子会议上，有更多的人问候毛主席。”我们站起来紧紧地热诚地握了手。
    朴正爱是朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长，最后她把一包信件郑重地交给我们，她说：
    “这是朝鲜妇女送给中国妇女的礼品！”
    原来这包里包着是火一样的热情，这是无数在战斗着的朝鲜妇女写的信，无数姊妹们的真挚的语言，这里的一封是元山市人民委员会李延田写的，她写着：“……你们把自己最爱的丈夫和儿子送到朝鲜前线来，他们和我们的丈夫和儿子并肩作战，把美帝国主义赶走，他们所到达的地方就是胜利……”让我们永远记着这中朝人民出自衷心的行动与语言吧！因为她在全世界都是最光荣的行动与最响亮的语言。
    我们告别了这个地方，当我们顺着地下走廊，走上地面的时候，我简直无法记述我的情感，我觉得人可以生活一百小时，过得并不算充实，但是人可以在一小时内得到胜过一切的充实，这就是你和火热的斗争紧紧结合在一起，和火热斗争中英雄的人们紧紧结合在一起的时候。到了地面上才知道朝鲜落了第一场春雨，这雨很大，一会将要浇湿我们，但我心中，忽然那样激动，朝鲜的春天真正来了，不管汽油弹怎样燃烧，农民总要在田地里播种了。天空一片漆黑，一片雨声，朴正爱同志和所有的男女同志们都纷纷奔出来，无数只手，一次又一次地握着，摇撼着、告别着。这时战争的警号忽然在漆黑的天空出现，闪光弹的蓝光忽然闪亮了一下，然后又熄灭了。这时暴雨挟着白色的烟雾笼罩了地面，我们的车驶动了，我在茫茫的雾中回过头，还看见朴正爱同志和其同志们站在那里摇着手，如同整个朝鲜人民站在战争暴风雨里，勇敢地、微笑地向中国人民摇着手。当我最后穿过废墟和战时的街道，一种庄严的思索出现在我们的脑际：夜晚，你前进着，你走进每一个朝鲜城市，在那一片废墟当中，你都会突然看见一个朝鲜人，他举着旗子，指挥着前进的方向。城市经常照耀着一片火光，飞机不停地盘旋，有时，一下亮起六七颗照明弹，准备随时向这里再投一批炸弹，卡车又常常拥塞在路口上，你在那里你觉得紧张、危险，你希望赶紧通过这个目标集中的城市就好了，但守在这个岗位上的人是那样坚定地抖动着他的旗子执行任务，多可敬的人呵！这里简直是一片火海，他就这样日日夜夜寸步不离在火海里坚持着，永远指着前进的方向。这个深刻的印象，常常一次又一次地突现在我的脑际，我从那一个一个坚定的人想到整个的朝鲜，在这为了和平，为了幸福而战争的朝鲜最主要的岗位上，朝鲜劳动党，英勇地举着斗争的旗帜，兀立在那里，永远指着前进的方向。
