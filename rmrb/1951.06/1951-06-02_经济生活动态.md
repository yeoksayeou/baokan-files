            Zhengzhou and Two Other Railway Bureaus Engage in Competition
            Xi'an Bureau Wins Red Banner After Successive Victories
    The development of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement has transformed the working conditions of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, which had relatively poor equipment. The bureau won the circulating red banner competition with the Zhengzhou and Hankou bureaus, ultimately securing victory. The circulating red banner competition began in February and lasted for three months. The competition criteria included train punctuality, number of wagons loaded, locomotive daily mileage, and vehicle turnover rate. The Xi'an Bureau exceeded its planned targets in all four competition criteria.

    Before the start of the competition, the Xi'an Bureau's leadership conducted a more widespread and in-depth patriotic ideological education for all employees, building on the Resist America, Aid Korea movement launched last year. Subsequently, the leadership proposed that solving the problems of train delays and cargo shortages was key to winning the competition. They mobilized employees to repeatedly discuss and research ways to overcome these issues. As a result, everyone used their brains and overcame the shortcomings of train delays through unity and mutual assistance. They also came up with ways to contact cargo owners through "finding," "talking," and "inviting," and used accounting methods to make cargo owners understand that railway transportation was cheap, fast, and safe, thereby expanding cargo sources. In addition, the Xi'an Bureau improved the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between departments through this red banner competition, corrected some employees' conservative thinking and purely technical viewpoints in production, and laid a solid foundation for future work.
        Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration and its Affiliated Factories Actively Seek Ways to Reduce Workshop Temperature and Humidity
    In order to improve the working conditions of textile workers, the Qingdao Branch of the East China Textile Administration is actively working to reduce workshop temperature and humidity, striving to successfully complete the task by the end of June this year. The bureau's Engineering Department, Materials Department, Mechanical Factory, and the Mechanical Departments of various factories are all treating this major task as their current central work. After two months of effort, the architectural surveying and design have been completed, and all can be completed within May. The Mechanical Factory, which is responsible for manufacturing various parts, guarantees that they will be completed and delivered successively from mid-May to June. The insulation manufactured by State-owned Qingdao No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory has been fully delivered. The accessories made by the repair departments of various factories are also being actively rushed. The workers of the Mechanical Department of the State-owned Qingdao No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and completed the repair of the cloth field's cold air blower before May 1st, using this to challenge other factories.
            Xikang Holds First Farmers' Representative Conference
            Striving to Complete Land Reform in Han Areas This Year
    Xikang Province held its first provincial Farmers' Representative Conference from May 2nd to 6th, lasting four days. A total of 260 farmer representatives from Han, Tibetan, Yi, and Lisu ethnic groups attended the conference. The conference discussed the implementation of land reform this year in the Han people's residential areas, which have a population of 1.3 million in the whole province, and established the Xikang Provincial Farmers' Association Committee before the end of the conference.

    Xikang Province will strive to basically complete the land reform in the Han people's residential areas this year. Because these areas have implemented rent reduction and launched anti-local tyrant movements in the past six months, and the organization of farmers' associations is relatively widespread. The province already has 360,000 members of farmers' associations, and the peasant armed self-defense force has also grown stronger than before.
            A Certain Unit Stationed in Xinjiang Plants 35,000 Mu of Cotton
    A certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region planted 35,000 mu of cotton this year, and all sowing was completed by May 10th. Most of the cotton seeds sown were early-maturing Soviet varieties. This kind of cotton has long fibers, is cold-resistant, and has a strong resistance to diseases and insect pests, making it suitable for growth in the northern region of Xinjiang. Before liberation, except for a few cotton plants scattered in the Turpan Basin and some warmer areas of southern Xinjiang, cotton planting was very rare in the vast areas due to the cold climate. Last year, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xinjiang universally experimented with cotton planting in agricultural production. As a result, the branches and leaves were lush and the cotton bolls were abundant. The output of good yields reached 80 catties of ginned cotton per mu, which greatly encouraged the confidence of the troops and farmers in planting cotton. Based on this, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government plans to expand the cotton field area to more than 960,000 mu for the whole province's military and civilians this year.

            郑州等三铁路分局进行竞赛
            西安分局连得红旗最后获胜
    抗美援朝运动的开展，使设备条件比较差的西安铁路分局的工作面貌改观。该分局在和郑州、汉口两分局所进行的循环红旗竞赛中连得红旗并最后获胜。循环红旗竞赛是从二月开始的，为期三月。竞赛的条件包括列车正点、装车数、机车日行公里、车辆周转率等四项。西安分局在这四项竞赛条件上都超过了预定的目标。
    竞赛开始以前，西安分局领导方面即在去年开展的抗美援朝运动的基础上对全体职工进行了更为普遍和深入的爱国主义思想教育。接着，领导方面就提出解决列车晚点和货源缺的问题是争取竞赛胜利的关键，发动职工反复讨论，研究克服的办法。结果，大家开动脑筋，以团结互助办法克服了列车晚点的缺点。大家又想出用“找”“说”“请”的办法和货主联系，并用算账的办法，使货主了解铁路运输便宜、迅速、安全，扩大了货源。此外，西安分局通过这次红旗竞赛，也改善了上下级之间和部门与部门之间的关系，纠正了某些职工在生产上的保守思想和单纯技术观点，为今后工作打下了巩固的基础。
        华东纺织管理局青岛分局及所属各厂积极设法降低车间温湿度
    华东纺织管理局青岛分局为改善纺织工人的劳动条件，正积极进行降低车间温湿度工作，争取本年六月底胜利完成任务。该局工务处、机料处、机械厂及各厂机动科都把这一巨大任务作为目前中心工作来进行。经过两个月的努力，建筑方面勘测设计已全部完毕，五月份内均可完工。机械厂承制各项机件，均保证自五月中旬到六月间陆续完成交清。国营棉纺织青岛第五厂承制的隔热器已全部交货。各厂修理部自制的配件，亦在积极赶做。国营棉纺织青岛第四厂机动科工人更发挥了高度积极性，于“五一”前完成了布场冷风机修复工作，并以此向各厂挑战。
            西康举行首届农民代表会议
            争取今年完成汉族地区土改
    西康省在五月二日到六日四天中，举行了全省第一次农民代表会议。到会的有汉、藏、彝、黎苏等民族的农民代表共二百六十人。会议以讨论今年在全省一百三十万人口的汉族人民聚居地区实行土地改革，并于会议结束前，成立了西康省农民协会委员会。
    西康省将争取在今年基本上完成汉族人民聚居地区的土地改革。因为这些地区在过去半年内已实行过减租，开展过反恶霸运动，农民协会的组织比较普遍。全省已有农民协会会员三十六万人，农民武装自卫队也较前壮大。
            驻新疆某部种棉三万五千亩
    新疆军区某部今年植棉三万五千亩，至五月十日止已全部播种完毕。所播棉种多为苏联早熟种。这种棉花纤维长，耐寒，抗病虫害的能力强，适于新疆北部地区生长。解放前新疆全省除吐鲁番盆地及南疆部分较热地区零星种些棉花外，广大地区都因气候寒冷极少植棉。人民解放军驻新疆部队于去年农业生产中曾普遍试种棉花，结果枝叶茂盛，棉桃累累，每亩产量好的达到皮棉八十市斤，这就大大鼓舞了部队和农民的植棉信心。据此，新疆省人民政府今年计划全省军民扩大棉田面积九十六万余亩。
