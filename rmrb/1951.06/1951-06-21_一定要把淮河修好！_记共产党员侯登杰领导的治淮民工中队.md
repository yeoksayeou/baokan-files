　　We Must Repair the Huai River!
    ——A Record of Communist Party Member Hou Dengjie Leading a Huai River Harnessing Labor Team

From the active actions of the Communist Party members and the vast number of laborers on the Huai River harnessing front, we see a strong guarantee for "We must repair the Huai River!"

At the beginning of the spring repair project, the sky was filled with heavy snow. In this wind and snow, the Chen Yingzi team – one of the hundreds of teams on the Huai River harnessing front – transferred from the "Sanhejian" construction site to the "Sibai Zhang" Huai embankment. After a hundred-li march, everyone was very tired. But they did not relax their work, quickly set up simple shelters, and prepared to repair the "Sibai Zhang" Huai embankment as soon as the wind and snow stopped. Comrade Hou Dengjie, the leader of the team, was a young and excellent Communist Party member. He estimated that the Huai River might rise due to the snowfall, so after everyone rested, he and Youth League member Lu Chengren took turns patrolling the embankment. Hou Dengjie was also very tired, but he thought: the "Sibai Zhang" Huai embankment is the screen door of the Xiage Dike, and the Xiage Dike is the back door of the midstream flood storage area. If the "Sibai Zhang" dike is not repaired quickly, the Huai River will flood into Jiangjia Lake. In this way, the Xiage Dike could not be built, and the floodwater intercepted by the Runheji Sluice and stored in Chengxi Lake would still re-enter the Huai River through Jiangjia Lake. This is a matter of life and death for millions of people in the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River. Therefore, he concentrated his energy and monitored the flowing Huai River. Soon, he found a lot of white foam floating on the water. This was a sign that the Huai River was about to rise. Hou Dengjie and Lu Chengren immediately became nervous, cautiously squatted by the Huai River, and carefully observed the white foam on the water. Half an hour later, they determined that the Huai River was indeed gradually rising. Hou Dengjie was very anxious and hurriedly ran back to the simple shelters with Lu Chengren to wake everyone up.

On the way, they met Chen Xiaoxi and Xiao Zijin. Chen Xiaoxi said to Hou Dengjie: "Instructor, how could we sleep? We have already estimated that the Huai River may rise. But these days of marching and building shelters, everyone is very tired and wants to sleep. Later, we came up with a way to take turns sleeping and take turns being on duty." Hou Dengjie hurriedly told them: "The Huai River is rising, hurry to the simple shelters and wake everyone up!" So, the whole team immediately became nervous. Hou Dengjie gave a brief propaganda and mobilization speech to everyone, saying: "Comrades! Chairman Mao has called on us to 'fundamentally harness the Huai River.' Now that the Huai River wants to destroy our river harnessing plan before the 'Sibai Zhang' Huai embankment is repaired, everyone must have the courage to fight the Huai River."

All six hundred laborers in the team immediately carried shovels and baskets and advanced in the wind and snow. They went to the embankment, dug yellow soil, and carried it one load at a time to the breaches of the "Sibai Zhang" Huai embankment. Hou Dengjie's feet were frozen numb, but he still dug soil shovel by shovel; Lu Chengren's toes were cut by ice and snow, but he still carried soil and ran. Everyone worked until the next morning, and every breach in the "Sibai Zhang" Huai embankment was raised by two meters of thick soil. The flood that attempted to break through the "Sibai Zhang" Huai embankment was driven back.

The Communist Party members, male and female laborers, on the Huai River harnessing front are not only hardworking and brave, but also full of creativity. When Hou Dengjie's team transferred to the Xiage Dike, they encountered a major difficulty. The mud dug out of the soil pond was soft and sticky, but when it was carried to the dike, it turned into hard clods like stones. A one-hundred-and-sixty-jin stone rammer could not flatten the river dike built with these hard clods. Hou Dengjie mobilized everyone to find ways to overcome this difficulty.

That night, rammer team leader Chen Xiaoxi thought: I must find a way. Our past days were too bitter. After liberation, the Communist Party is leading us to carry out land reform, and Chairman Mao has called on us to "fundamentally harness the Huai River." Can we not do our best? Thinking of this, Chen Xiaoxi had strength and wisdom. He came up with the idea of tying two stone rammers together to ram the hard clods, and discussed it with Xiao Zijin. Xiao Zijin said, "It's better to use a stone roller."

When Comrade Hou Dengjie and several rammer workers were studying ways to overcome the difficulties, Chen Xiaoxi and Xiao Zijin carried a large stone roller, and the two said with smiles: "Instructor! We have come up with a solution. Use this thing to ram, and we guarantee that it will meet the engineering standards one hundred percent." Everyone came to see the stone roller, and a few people moved it a few times and said, "This thing weighs at least eight hundred jin. How can we lift it up to ram?" Hou Dengjie said with confidence, "As long as everyone thinks of a way, it can be done." So everyone studied together, first taking four carrying poles and tying them into a well shape to hold the stone roller, and eight people carried the carrying poles to ram. The next day, after ramming for a whole day, it had already met 70% of the ramming standard, but everyone's hands were blistered with blood. On the third day, they changed to using two iron wires, woven into a cross shape, as the bottom of the stone roller rammer, and then used the method of tying the stone rammer, tying ropes around the waist of the stone roller rammer, and thirteen people pulled the ropes to ram. The test results showed that not only could the stone roller be lifted over the chest, but it could also be lifted over the head. As long as it is rammed twice, it can meet 80% of the ramming standard; if it is rammed three times, it can meet 120% of the ramming standard. This solved a major difficulty for the Xiage Dike construction site. The engineering personnel of the county headquarters believe that this creation has made a great contribution to the dike engineering of future flood storage projects.

### 一定要把淮河修好！——记共产党员侯登杰领导的治淮民工中队

　　一定要把淮河修好！
    ——记共产党员侯登杰领导的治淮民工中队
    从治淮线上的共产党员和广大民工身上的积极行动中，我们看到了“一定要把淮河修好”的有力保证。
    在春修工程刚开始的时候，天空正飘着鹅毛大雪。在这大风大雪里，陈郢孜中队——这是治淮线上数百个中队里的一个——从“三河尖”工地转移到“四百丈”淮堤上。经过百里行军，大家已十分疲劳。但他们并没有放松自己的工作赶快搭起工棚，准备风雪一停，就动手培修“四百丈”淮堤。中队的领导者侯登杰同志是一个年青的优秀的共产党员，他估计淮水可能因为下雪而上涨，所以在大家休息后，他和青年团员鹿成仁在堤上轮流巡视。侯登杰也是很疲劳的，但他想到：“四百丈”淮堤是下格堤的屏门，下格堤是中游蓄洪地区的后门，如果不迅速把“四百丈”堤修好，淮水就要浸入姜家湖。这样，下格堤就建筑不起来，从润河集分水闸拦蓄进到城西湖的洪水，仍会由姜家湖再入淮河。这是关系着淮河中下游千百万人生命的问题。因此，他集中精力，监视着流动的淮水。不久，发现水面上浮着许多白沫。这是淮水即将上涨的迹象。侯登杰和鹿成仁立刻紧张起来，谨慎地蹲在淮水边，仔细观察水面上的白沫。半个钟头后他们断定了淮水确在逐渐上涨。侯登杰非常着急，赶忙和鹿成仁跑回工棚唤醒大家。
    在半路上，他们遇见了陈小喜和萧子金。陈小喜对侯登杰说：“指导员，俺们怎么能睡得着呢？俺们已经估计到淮水可能上涨了。可是这几天行军、搭棚，大家都疲乏得很，都想睡觉。后来俺们就想了个办法，轮流睡觉，轮流坐班。”侯登杰急忙告诉他们说：“淮河涨水了，赶快到工棚里去叫醒大家！”于是，全中队立刻紧张起来了。侯登杰向大家作了简短的宣传鼓动工作他说：“同志们！毛主席号召咱们‘根治淮河’，现在淮水在‘四百丈’淮堤还未修好的时候，要来破坏咱们治河的计划，大家要有勇气，要和淮水斗一斗。”
    全中队六百多个民工，立刻扛着锹，挑着筐，在大风雪中前进。上了堤边，挖了黄土，一担一担地挑到“四百丈”淮堤的破口上。侯登杰的脚早被冻麻了，但他仍是一锹锹地挖土；鹿成仁的脚指被冰雪划破了，仍然挑着土飞跑。大家一直工作到第二天上午，“四百丈”淮堤的每一个缺口上，都增高了二公尺厚土。企图冲破“四百丈”淮堤的洪水就被打回去了。
    在治淮线上的共产党员，男女民工，不仅是勤劳的，勇敢的，而且是富于创造力的。当侯登杰中队转移到下格堤时，遇到了一个重大的困难。从土塘里挖出的泥土，又软又粘，但是挑到堤上，就变成石礓一样的硬块。一百六十斤的石硪打不平这种硬块修的河堤。侯登杰动员大家想办法克服这个困难。
    当天夜里，硪工队长陈小喜想道：我一定要想个办法。俺们过去的日子太苦了，解放以后，共产党领导俺们正在进行土地改革，毛主席又号召俺们“根治淮河”，俺们能不为力吗？陈小喜想到这些，就有了力量，有了智慧。他想出把两个石硪绑在一起打硬块的办法，并和萧子金商量。萧子金说：“还不如用石滚好。”
    侯登杰同志和几个硪工研究克服困难的办法的时候，陈小喜和萧子金抬来一个大石滚，俩人笑嘻嘻地说：“指导员！俺们想出了办法，用这个家伙打，管保就能合乎工程标准百分之百。”大家都来看石滚有几个人搬动了几下说：“这家伙足有八百斤重，怎么能抬起打呢？”侯登杰充满信心地说：“只要大家想办法，就可以办到。”于是大家就互相研究，先拿来四根扁担绑成井字形，挟住石滚，八个人抬着扁担打。第二天打了一天，已合乎行硪标准百分之七十，但每个人的手都磨起了血泡。第三天改用两道铁丝，攀成十字形，作石滚硪底，然后用拴石硪办法，在石滚硪腰间拴上绳子，由十三个人拉住绳子打。试验结果，不仅可把石滚举过胸脯，还可举过头顶。只要打两遍，就可合乎行硪标准百分之八十；如打三遍，可合乎行硪标准百分之一百二十。这就给下格堤工地解决了一个重大困难。县总队部工程人员认为这个创造，对今后蓄洪工程的堤防工程有极大的贡献。
