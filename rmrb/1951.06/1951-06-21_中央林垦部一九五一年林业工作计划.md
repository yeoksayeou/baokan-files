Editor's Note: Li Fanwu, Deputy Minister of the Forestry and Land Reclamation Department, delivered a report on the summary of forestry work in 1950 and the forestry work plan for 1951 at the 80th Political Affairs Council meeting of the Government Administration Council on April 13, 1951. The report was approved by the same meeting of the Government Administration Council. The following is an excerpt from the third part of the report, "1951 Forestry Work Plan":

(I) Guiding Principles and Tasks:

	(1) Conscientiously implement the policy of universal forest and mountain protection. Strictly prevent forest fires, prohibit indiscriminate logging, prohibit opening up wasteland on steep slopes, and prohibit digging up grass roots and tree roots on barren hills and sand dunes. In order to clarify the responsibilities for the protection and management of forests, forest rights should be determined in conjunction with land reform in the new areas, and forest rights should also be cleared and determined step by step in the old areas.

	(2) Actively carry out key afforestation, focusing on the construction of protection forests. Begin or prepare to create water conservation forests in the upper reaches of the Huai River, Yellow River, Yongding River, Liao River, and other rivers with severe flooding, and create riverbank protection forests along the rivers. In the Northwest, North China, Henan, and other areas where farmland is severely affected by wind and sand, begin to create windbreak and sand-fixation forests. In the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and Changbai Mountains and other areas, carry out regeneration and tending work on logging sites in state-owned forests. South of the Yangtze River, leadership and assistance for private economic forests should be strengthened. In addition, mobilize the masses across the country to plant trees using vacant land.

	(3) Closing hillsides for afforestation has achieved successful experience and should be vigorously promoted with emphasis in mountainous and barren areas with better natural conditions or better mass conditions in the future.

	(4) In terms of forest utilization, for state-owned forest areas, we should adhere to the principle of rational logging and rational use of timber, as well as unified logging and unified allocation. In Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, it is necessary to extend railways to undeveloped forest areas and increase the logging and use of broad-leaved trees. Natural forests in Northwest China, Southwest China, and other places must also be appropriately developed and utilized, but there must be a thorough plan. Agricultural and forestry authorities should properly manage timber merchants' purchase or contracting of private forests. At the same time, attention should be paid to improving varieties, increasing production, and improving processing technology for important forest products such as tung oil, rubber, rosin, and tannin.

	(5) In order to meet the needs of logging and afforestation, continue to conduct key surveys and explorations of forest areas.

	(6) In terms of forestry experimental research, research and experiments should be carried out purposefully and with emphasis based on existing conditions and in conjunction with the needs of practical work.

	(7) Training a large number of cadres is one of the most important tasks at present. In addition to suggesting that the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government instruct the forestry departments of various universities to enroll more new students and establish forestry specialized courses based on existing conditions, agricultural and forestry departments in various regions and agricultural and forestry bureaus in various provinces must use certain manpower and financial resources to run short-term training courses. All forestry institutions should recruit as many trainees as possible.

(II) Specific Requirements:

	Afforestation area: 2,450,000 mu; seedling cultivation: 56,000 mu.
	Area of closing hillsides for afforestation: 7,500,000 mu.
	Forest survey area: 76,377,000 mu.
	Exploration area for afforestation land and nursery land: 2,646,000 mu.
	Training of grassroots forestry cadres: 4,300 people.

(III) Grasping Important Links in the Work:

	In order to complete the 1951 forestry plan, the following three important links must be effectively grasped:

	First, rely on the masses: Forestry is a national, arduous, and heavy construction undertaking, and tasks can only be completed by relying on the masses. Therefore, in the specific formulation and implementation of various forestry policies, attention should be paid to combining the interests of the masses; strengthening forestry publicity and education for the masses; and training a large number of activists and model workers among the masses in order to enable the broad masses to actively participate in forestry construction.

	Second, strengthen leadership: The foundation of forestry work is weak, and most of the masses and cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of national forestry policies, and forests are still being severely damaged. Therefore, governments at all levels should strengthen leadership over forestry work and use various meetings to conduct publicity and education about forestry to cadres, and arrange, inspect, and summarize forestry work in a unified manner with agricultural production.

	Third, master technology: If appropriate technical guidance is not given after the masses are mobilized, it will inevitably cause huge losses in manpower and financial resources. Therefore, all forestry work cadres must study their business, improve their technology, and go deep among the masses to patiently provide the masses with technical guidance so that the technology can gradually be mastered by the broad masses. We must respect technology and oppose the view of underestimating technology.

　　中央林垦部一九五一年林业工作计划
    编者按：林垦部李范五副部长在一九五一年四月十三日举行的政务院第八十次政务会议上，作了关于林垦部一九五零年林业工作总结和一九五一年的林业工作计划的报告，该报告业经政务院同次会议批准。现摘录该报告第三部分“一九五一年林业工作计划”发表如下：
  （一）方针任务：
    （１）认真贯彻普遍护林护山政策。严防林野火灾，禁止滥伐树木，禁止陡坡开荒，禁止在荒山及沙丘掘草根挖树根。为明确林木的保护管理责任，在新区应结合土地改革确定林权，在老区亦应有步骤地清理林权，确定林权。
    （２）积极开展重点造林，并以营造保安林为主。在淮河、黄河、永定河、辽河及其他泛滥较严重的河流上游山地开始或准备营造水源林，沿河营造护岸林。在西北、华北、河南及其他风沙侵袭农田较严重地区，开始营造防风防沙林。在大小兴安岭与长白山及其他地区，对国有林采伐迹地，进行更新抚育工作，在长江以南应加强对私营经济林的领导与辅助。此外，在全国普遍号召群众利用隙地植树。
    （３）封山育林已取得了成功的经验，今后在自然条件较好或群众条件较好的山荒地区有重点的大力推行。
    （４）在森林利用方面，对国有林区，应坚持木材的合理采伐与合理使用以及统一采伐与统一调拨的方针。在东北及内蒙须要向未开发林区延伸铁道，并增加对阔叶树的采伐与使用量。西北、西南等地的天然林，亦须作适当的开发利用，但必须有周密的计划。对木商收购或包伐私有林，应由农林机关加以适当管理。同时对桐油、橡胶、松香及丹宁等重要的林产品，应注意改良品种、增加生产及提高加工技术。
    （５）为适应伐木及造林的需要，对林野继续进行重点调查勘测。
    （６）在林业试验研究方面，应根据现有条件，结合实际工作的需要，进行有目的有重点的研究试验工作。
    （７）大量培养干部，是目前最重要的任务之一。除建议中央人民政府教育部根据现有条件责成各大学森林系多招新生，增设林业专修科外，各区农林部及各省农林厅必须使用一定的人力财力，开办短期训练班。各林业事业机关，应尽量招收练习生。
  （二）具体要求：
    造林面积：二、四五○、○○○市亩，育苗五六、○○○亩。
    封山育林面积：七、五○○、○○○亩。
    森林调查面积：七六、三七七、○○○亩。
    造林地及苗圃地的勘测面积：二、六四六、○○○亩。
    林业基层干部训练：四、三○○名。
  （三）掌握工作中的重要环节：
    为完成一九五一年林业计划，必须切实掌握下列三个重要环节：
    第一、依靠群众：林业是全国性的艰巨繁重的建设事业，必须依靠群众，才能完成任务。因此，在各种林业政策的具体规定与执行上，要注意结合群众利益；对群众加强林业宣传教育；并大批培养群众的积极分子及劳动模范。以便使广大群众积极参加林业建设。
    第二、加强领导：林业工作基础薄弱，多数群众及干部对国家林业政策了解不够，森林还在继续遭受严重破坏，因此，各级政府对林业工作应加强领导利用各种会议，向干部进行关于林业的宣传教育，把林业工作与农业生产统一进行布置、检查与总结。
    第三、掌握技术：群众行动起来之后，若不给以适当的技术指导，必然造成人力财力上的巨大损失。因此，所有林业工作干部必须学习业务，提高技术，并深入到群众中去，耐心的给群众以技术指导，使技术逐渐为广大群众所掌握。我们要尊重技术，反对轻视技术的观点。
