　　Workers of Beijing Film Studio and China Film Management Company
    Initiate Donation of "People's Film" Aircraft
    National Federation of Literary and Art Circles Sends Telegram to Local Federations to Launch Donation Campaign
    [This newspaper dispatch] Workers of Beijing Film Studio and China Film Management Company have launched a campaign to donate airplanes and cannons. Many workers have suggested that film workers across the country donate a "People's Film" aircraft and have drafted specific methods. 1. Select the best films from each unit, on a voluntary basis, to hold charity film screenings, and donate all or part of the film revenue, management company fees, and cinema and projection team income. 2. Each film worker, according to their individual economic conditions, voluntarily donates a certain amount from their income (such as salary, remuneration, royalties, bonuses, etc.), either once or monthly. 3. Mobilize film workers to perform in charity events, such as theatrical performances and musical performances, and donate all income after expenses.
    This proposal was immediately endorsed by the All-China Film Art Workers Association and the Film Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture. Letters have been sent to state-owned and private film studios, management companies, state-owned and private cinemas, mobile film projection teams, and other relevant units across the country, planning to organize a national film industry donation preparatory committee to widely solicit responses from film workers across the country.
