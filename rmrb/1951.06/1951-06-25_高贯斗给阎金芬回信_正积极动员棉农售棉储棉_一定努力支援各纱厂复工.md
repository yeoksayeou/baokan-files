Gao Guandou's Reply to Yan Jinfen
    Actively Mobilizing Cotton Farmers to Sell and Store Cotton
    Determined to Support the Resumption of Work in Various Textile Mills

Comrade Yan Jinfen, Industrial Labor Model:

    I read your letter to me in the People's Daily and learned that many of our textile mills have stopped working due to a shortage of cotton. I am very anxious. I will definitely more actively call on and lead the farmer brothers to sell the cotton they have stored to the state or store it with state economic agencies, so that our factories can continue production. We farmers must work hard to support the workers; we must not let you down.

    When I read the news in the newspaper that the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were calling on cotton farmers to sell and store cotton, I felt that this was a major task at hand. I immediately found some production mutual aid team leaders and cotton farmers to discuss how to do this. At first, some people showed an indifferent attitude towards this matter. Some people also suggested that in this way, the price of cotton must rise, and they wanted to see the price before selling. The reason why they were like this was because they did not understand that cotton farmers' prosperity was due to the help of the People's Government, that there is no family without a country, and that to prosper, one must protect the country. Later, I, together with village cadres and Communist Party members, used various specific facts to repeatedly explain to everyone: In the era of warlords, bureaucrats, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we could not prosper in any way; only under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government and the Communist Party, did we turn over, divide the land, and the government implemented policies to encourage cotton planting and protect the interests of cotton farmers, helping us in all aspects. In this way, we cannot only care about our own prosperity when growing cotton, regardless of the needs and difficulties of the country. Moreover, if the textile mills stop working, if the price of cloth and other commodities fluctuate as a result, it will also be detrimental to the farmers. The cotton farmers realized that the interests of the individual and the interests of the country are inseparable, and everyone proposed to sell the stored cotton to strive for the early resumption of work in the factories. For example, cotton farmer Gao Dongchen said: "This should be done. Could we have prospered in the early days of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries' rule?" Some said: "We cannot only think about our own small calculations, but also think about the country's big calculations." Now, the farmers who have stored cotton are constantly selling it. Cotton farmer Li Huanzhang sold all of the more than 170 kilograms of cotton he had stored for three years to the state. Through my personal mobilization, eight cotton farmers sold their stored cotton. In order to facilitate the masses to sell cotton, our village also restored the cotton trading market, which had been closed for a long time, and purchased more than 1,300 kilograms of cotton in two market days. Recently, the Communist Party branch of our village proposed a patriotic cotton sales competition to all village branches in the district, guaranteeing the completion of the task within ten days.

    Comrade Yan Jinfen, please tell the worker brothers in the textile mills that in order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, workers and peasants should work together to build our new China. I will definitely lead the farmer brothers to supply you with more cotton. Take our village as an example. Last year, we planted more than 1,100 mu of cotton, and this year we have increased it by 500 mu. Last year, each mu yielded 160 kilograms of cotton. This year, by further improving technology and changing to superior varieties, we will strive to harvest 200 kilograms per mu. Through this patriotic call for selling and storing cotton, cotton farmers have raised their patriotic ideology. After the autumn harvest, I guarantee to supply the country with more cotton as soon as possible. Let the workers and farmers of our new China join hands, work together, and defend and build our new China well!
        
        With best regards,
        Gao Guandou

　　高贯斗给阎金芬回信
    正积极动员棉农售棉储棉
    一定努力支援各纱厂复工工业劳动模范阎金芬同志：
    在人民日报上看到了你写给我的信，知道咱们有很多纱厂因为缺少棉花停了工，我心里很着急。我一定更加积极地号召和带动农民弟兄，把所存的棉花卖给国家或向国家经济机关储存，好让咱们的工厂能够继续生产。我们农民一定要努力支援工人，我们决不能辜负你们的希望。
    我在报上看到中央人民政府政务院和中共中央号召棉农售棉储棉的消息后，就感到这是眼前的大事情。我就马上找了一些生产互助组组长和棉农，商量如何办这件事。开头，有些人对这事还表现着不关痛痒的态度。有的人还提出，这样一来，棉花一定要涨价，要看看价钱再卖。他们所以这样，是因为闹不清楚棉农发家是由于人民政府的帮助，没有国就没有家，要发家必须保国的道理。后来我就和村干部、共产党员，用各种具体事实，反复向大家说明：在军阀官僚及国民党反动派统治时代，咱们怎么也不能发家；只有在人民政府及共产党的领导和帮助下，咱们翻了身，分了土地，政府又实行奖励植棉和保护棉农利益的政策，从各方面帮助咱们。这样，咱们种棉花就不能只顾自己发家，而不管国家的需要和困难。而且，纱厂停了工，如果布价和其他物价因此有了波动，对农民也是不利的。棉农们认识到了个人的利益和国家的利益是分不开的，大家就提出要出售存棉，争取工厂早日复工。如棉农高栋臣说：“应该这样作，要是像早先日本鬼子和国民党反动派统治时期，咱还能发家？”有的说：“咱们不能光打自己的小算盘，也要打国家的大算盘。”现在存棉的农民正不断地将棉花售出。棉农李焕章将三年存下来的一百七十多斤棉花全部卖给国家。经过我个人的动员，就有八户棉农出售了存棉。为了便于群众出售棉花，俺村又将停了很久的棉花交易市场恢复了，两个集日就收购了一千三百多斤棉花。最近我村中共支部向全区各村支部提出爱国售棉竞赛，保证十天内完成任务。
    阎金芬同志，请你转告纱厂的工人弟兄们，为了巩固工农联盟，工人、农民共同努力，建设咱们新中国，我一定带动农民弟兄供给你们更多的棉花。就拿俺村说吧，去年植棉一千一百余亩，今年又增加了五百亩。去年每亩产棉一百六十斤，今年经进一步提高技术，改换优良品种，要争取每亩收二百斤。经过这次爱国售棉储棉的号召宣传，棉农们提高了爱国思想，在秋收以后，我保证及早把更多的棉花供给国家。让咱们新中国的工人、农民拉起手来，共同努力，好好保卫和建设咱们的新中国吧！
        此致敬礼
        高贯斗
