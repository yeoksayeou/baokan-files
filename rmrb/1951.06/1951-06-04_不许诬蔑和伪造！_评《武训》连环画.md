No Slander or Fabrication Allowed!
    -- A Critique of the "Wu Xun" Comic Strip

    The "Wu Xun" comic strip is a work of the same thought as the "Biography of Wu Xun," a work that supports feudalist ideology. However, in addition to this common feature, this picture album particularly emphasizes the issue of education. The "Our Words" from Popular Art Publishing House begins with the first sentence, "Wu Xun is China's first person enthusiastic about running education." "In China, whether in rural areas or cities, there are so many children out of school... We hope this booklet will bring the spirit of Wu Xun to every corner, so that everyone will put forth their strength, China needs a large number of new 'Wu Xuns'." Needless to say, they believe that Wu Xun's running education is "unprecedented" in China. What about the future? The preface (by Sun Mingjing) says: "Today's (please note it is today) China, whether government and people, whether groups and individuals, are much richer, more powerful, and more knowledgeable than Wu Xun. If everyone uses the spirit of Wu Xun, plus modern knowledge and progressive organization, they will definitely be able to run better and more educational undertakings than Wu Xun." The meaning is also very clear: the government, people, groups, and individuals all have money and power, but they lack the "Wu Xun spirit." There are so many children out of school in China, the pity is that we lack this "spirit," so we must "everyone put forth their strength" and "need a large number of new Wu Xuns."

    The large number of children out of school in China was created by the old China. If we want to talk about responsibility, then who should be responsible for this? This comic strip was published in 1950, and what it emphasizes is obviously that "today" our government and people, groups and individuals, bear a great responsibility for children out of school. Because we are all "richer and more powerful" than Wu Xun, but we just lack the "Wu Xun spirit," so these poor children are excluded from the school gate. Then let's take a look at the educational situation in New China!

    In April 1950, Comrade Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated in his article "Education and Culture in New China" about the state of our cultural education: "...Facts in the past year prove that in the liberated areas, wherever land reform has been completed and industry has been significantly restored, the development of education is quite rapid. For example, in the Northeast Administrative Region, the number of primary school students is 3,777,151, an increase of 48.2% compared with the 2,541,322 during the Japanese occupation. The number of middle school students is 143,986, an increase of 108.6% compared with the 68,940 during the Japanese occupation in 1941. The number of primary school students in Hebei Province is now 2,337,401, an increase of 89% compared with 1,233,786 in 1936, before the War of Resistance Against Japan. The current number of middle school students in Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Chahar has increased by 31.8% compared with 1936. In terms of the number of schools, the Northeast Administrative Region has now exceeded 60% before liberation, and the five provinces in North China have increased by about 50% compared with the Kuomintang rule. Looking at the class composition of the students, we can also see huge changes. Taking the Northeast as an example, the children of workers, farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and urban poor accounted for 81.3% of all enrolled children last year. For example, according to statistics from Lin County, a province in the North China Plain, the children of poor peasants, farm laborers and middle peasants accounted for 94% of all enrolled children. This situation has never happened in Chinese history." This passage makes the "Wu Xun spirit" of the "Our Words" of the Popular Art Publishing House and Sun Mingjing's preface fall through. This change in the situation, the increase in the number of enrollments, is not because today's government and people have increased the "Wu Xun spirit"; on the contrary, it is precisely because today's government and people have overthrown the "Wu Xun spirit," overthrown feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism, so that those peasants struggling on the edge of poverty and death have been given land, the landlord class has been eliminated, and the workers have become the leading class, so that those "extremely numerous out-of-school children" in rural areas and cities have gradually and massively gained the opportunity to study. Isn't this the fact? May I ask on what grounds does the editor of the picture album slander our government and people?

    What is more noteworthy in the picture album is: "Wu Xun's spirit of running schools moved Wang Pixian, Duan Chengze... and even Mr. Tao Xingzhi" (see "Our Words"); therefore, Wang Pixian became Wu Xun the second (picture 84), Duan Chengze became Wu Xun the third (picture 85), and Tao Xingzhi became Wu Xun the fourth (picture 86). At the same time, the description of the picture album says: "Mr. Tao Xingzhi... vigorously promoted the spirit of Wu Xun on a large scale... and laid the foundation for the new democratic education in China." We should thank the editors and authors of the picture album, they have already written the "genealogy" of the new Chinese education. Today's educators should be the fifth generation in order, and the ancestor of Chinese education originally fell on this "China's first person enthusiastic about running education" - Wu Xun.

    Education belongs to the scope of culture. How did Chairman Mao explain new democratic culture in On New Democracy? Chairman Mao said: "The so-called new democratic culture, in a word, is 'the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal culture of the people's masses led by the proletariat.'" (See Chapter 12 "Historical Characteristics of the Chinese Cultural Revolution" in On New Democracy). "This new democratic culture is scientific. It opposes all feudal and superstitious ideas, advocates seeking truth from facts, advocates objective truth, and advocates the unity of theory and practice." Chairman Mao also said: "China's long-term feudal society created a brilliant ancient culture. Therefore, clearing up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence. But we must never indiscriminately accept everything without criticism. We must distinguish between all the corrupt things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent ancient folk culture, which is somewhat democratic and revolutionary. China's current new politics and new economy have developed from the old politics and old economy of ancient times, and China's modern new culture has also developed from the old culture of ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our own history and never sever history. But this respect is to give history a certain scientific status, to respect the development of historical dialectics, not to praise the past and belittle the present, not to praise any feudal toxins. Therefore, for the masses of the people and young students, the main thing is not to guide them to look backward, but to guide them to look forward." (See Chapter 15 "National, Scientific, and Mass Culture" in On New Democracy). From this, we can see that the education of New China is not to make us praise feudal ideas, not to come from all the corrupt things of the ancient feudal ruling class, does not require us to absorb the feudal dross, does not require us to praise the past and belittle the present, does not require us to praise any feudal toxins, and does not require us to guide the masses of the people and young students to look backward, and even less to guide them to recognize this fabricated "genealogy." If someone is willing to be the fifth and sixth of Wu Xun who supports feudalism, it has nothing to do with the Chinese people and cultural and educational workers! We, the people of New China, resolutely do not allow slander against the nation, and do not allow fabrication of history!

　　不许诬蔑和伪造！
    ——评《武训》连环画
    华君武
    （上海大众美术出版社一九五○年五月出版，江丰、陈叔亮、野夫、陈烟桥主编，金陵大学音影部摄制，杨宝楠画。）
    《武训》连环画是和《武训画传》同一思想的作品，是拥护封建主义思想的作品。但是除了这一共同的特点以外，这本画册还特别强调了教育问题；大众美术出版社的《我们的话》，开章第一句就是“武训是中国第一位热心办教育的人”，“中国，不论在乡村和城市，失学的孩子真是多极了……希望这本册子，将武训的精神带到每一个角落里，让大家拿出力量来，中国需要大量的新《武训》。”不用说他们认为武训办教育，在中国是“空前”的，今后呢？序文中（孙明经作序）说：“今日（请注意是今日）的中国不论政府和人民，不论团体和个人，比武训有钱、有力、有学问的多得很。假如大家都以武训的精神，加上现代的知识和进步的组织，一定能办到比武训更好更多的教育事业。”这意思也很明白，政府、人民、团体、个人都有钱有力，就是缺少“武训精神”。中国失学的孩子多极了，可怜的就是我们缺少了这点“精神”，因此要“大家拿出力量来”，“需要大量的新武训”。
    中国失学的孩子多，是旧中国所造成的，如果要说责任，那末这究竟应该由谁来负责呢？这本连环画出版在一九五○年，它所强调的显然是“今日”我们的政府和人民，团体和个人对失学孩子要负很大的责任。因为我们都比武训“有钱有力”，但是偏偏缺乏“武训的精神”，因此这些可怜的孩子们就被排斥在校门之外。那么我们来看看新中国的教育情况吧！
    一九五○年四月中共中央宣传部长陆定一同志发表的《新中国的教育和文化》的文章上叙述到我国文化教育的状况，他说：“……从去年一年中的事实证明，在解放后的地区，凡是土地改革已经完成与产业已有显著恢复的地方，教育事业的发展是相当迅速的。例如目前东北行政区，小学生人数为三、七七七、一五一人，比日本占领时期的二、五四一、三二二人，增加了百分之四十八·二。中学生为一四三、九八六人，较一九四一年日本占领时期的六八、九四○人增加了百分之一○八·六。河北省现在的小学生人数为二、三三七、四○一人，比一九三六年，即抗日战争以前的一、二三三、七八六人增加了百分之八十九。河北、山东、山西、察哈尔现在的中学生人数，比起一九三六年增加了百分之三一·八。以学校数目来说，东北行政区目前已经超过解放以前百分之六十，华北五省比国民党统治时期增加了约百分之五十。再从学生的阶级成份来看，也可以看出巨大的变化。以东北来说，工人、雇农、贫农、中农以及城市贫民的子女，在去年已占全体入学儿童百分之八一·三。又如华北平原省林县的统计，贫雇农和中农子女入学者已占全体入学儿童百分之九十四。这种情形在中国历史上是从来没有过的。”这一段文章使得大众美术出版社的“我们的话”和孙明经的序文中的悲天悯人的“武训精神”落了空。这种状况的改变，入学人数的增加，并非是因为今天的政府和人民增加了“武训精神”的原因；相反的正因为今天的政府和人民打倒了“武训精神”，打倒了封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本主义，使那些在穷苦死亡边缘上挣扎的农民分得了土地，消灭了地主阶级，工人成为领导的阶级，因此使得乡村和城市中那些“多极了的失学孩子”逐渐地大批地得到了求学的机会，难道这不是事实么？请问画册的编辑人凭什么理由来诬蔑我们的政府和人民呢？
    画册中更值得注意的问题是：“武训的办学精神感动了王丕显、段承泽……乃至于陶行知先生”（见“我们的话”）；因此王丕显成了武训第二（八十四图），段承泽成了武训第三（八十五图），陶行知成了武训第四（八十六图）。同时在画册的说明上写着：“陶行知先生……有规模的发扬武训精神……并奠定中国新民主教育的基础。”我们应当感谢画册的编者和作者，他已经把新中国教育的“家谱”都写好了，今天的教育工作者按顺序来说应该是第五辈了，中国的教育的祖宗原来还是落到这位“中国第一位热心办教育的人”——武训——的头上。
    教育是属于文化的范围中的。毛主席在新民主主义论中如何在解释新民主主义的文化呢？毛主席说：“所谓新民主主义的文化，一句话，就是‘无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的文化’。”（见新民主主义论第十二章“中国文化革命的历史特点”），“这种新民主主义的文化是科学的。它是反对一切封建思想与迷信思想，主张实事求是，主张客观真理，主张理论与实践一致的。”毛主席又说：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。因此清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件。但是决不能无批判的兼收并蓄，必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的民间文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。中国现时的新政治新经济是从古代的旧政治旧经济发展而来的，中国现代的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此，我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建毒素。因此，对于人民群众与青年学生，主要的不是要引导他们向后看，而是要引导他们向前看。”（见新民主主义论第十五章“民族的科学的大众的文化”），由此我们可以看到新中国的教育并不是要我们去颂扬封建思想的，并不是从古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西中来的，并不需要我们去吸收封建性的糟粕，并不要我们去颂古非今，并不要我们去赞扬任何封建毒素，并不要我们去引导人民群众与青年学生向后看，更不要引导他们去认识这个伪造的“家谱”。如果有人愿意去做拥护封建主义的武训第五、第六，是和我们中国人民和文化教育工作者毫不相干的！我们新中国的人民坚决不许诬蔑民族，不许伪造历史！
