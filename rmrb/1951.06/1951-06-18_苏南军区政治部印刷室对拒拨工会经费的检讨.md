Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

To the Editors of the People's Daily:

The letter published in the People's Daily on May 5th, criticizing our printing factory for refusing to allocate trade union funds, is correct in our view. We should bear the responsibility for insufficient supervision and inspection.

The letter of criticism stated that the Southern Jiangsu Daily had published criticisms of this matter, but the factory had not made a review. The fact is this: In February, the factory had submitted the original draft of the review to the headquarters for examination. Later, due to personnel changes in the headquarters, the handover was unclear, which led to the delay. This is our negligence, and we should conduct a review.

Please publish the factory's review together with this letter.

                                       Political Department of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region

To the Editors:

The People's Daily published a letter on May 5th criticizing our factory for refusing to allocate trade union funds. This criticism has helped our work. The Trade Union Law is one of the fundamental laws of the country, and all production units should unconditionally implement it. However, we believed that military factories were different from general factories, one-sidedly emphasizing the difficulty of reimbursement procedures, and failed to allocate trade union funds on time. The trade union cadres repeatedly urged us, but the administrative leaders of our factory showed impatience. This is because we haven't studied enough and don't have sufficient understanding of the Trade Union Law. We sincerely accept the readers' criticism and guarantee that similar situations will not occur in the future.

In addition, there are a few points that need to be explained:

(1) After the Southern Jiangsu Daily published our criticism on February 13th, we sent the review and reply to the Southern Jiangsu Daily on February 15th. Because it was not published immediately, Comrade Zheng Baoli, the political instructor of our factory, personally went to the Southern Jiangsu Daily to inquire. At that time, the comrades of the newspaper said that they would reply in the name of the Political Department. Later, the organization of the Political Department of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region changed, so it was not possible to reply to them quickly.

(2) After consultation between the factory and the trade union cadres in March, all the past trade union funds were paid in full, and payments have been made on time since March. Therefore, this issue has now been resolved.

(3) The matter of withdrawing 30,000 yuan from the staff's food expenses as trade union funds did happen. This was an opinion put forward by Comrade Sun Daxian, the director of the trade union in our factory. Therefore, both the administration and the trade union are responsible.

### 苏南军区政治部印刷室对拒拨工会经费的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　苏南军区政治部印刷室
　　对拒拨工会经费的检讨编辑同志：
    五月五日人民日报上发表了读者批评我部印刷厂拒拨工会经费的信件，我们认为这个批评是正确的。我们应负督促检查不深入的责任。
    批评信件中说，苏南日报曾发表了对这件事情的批评，该厂未作检讨。事实是这样的：二月份该厂已将检讨原稿送交本部审查，后因本部人事变动，前后交待不清，以致拖延下来，这是我们的疏忽，我们应作检讨。
    附该厂的检讨请一并发表。
                                              苏南军区政治部编辑同志：
    五月五日人民日报发表了批评我厂拒拨工会经费的来信，这个批评，帮助了我们的工作。工会法是国家的根本大法之一，任何生产单位都应无条件地执行；而我们却认为军队的工厂与一般工厂不同，片面强调了报销手续的困难，未能按期拨发工会经费。工会干部一再催促，我厂行政领导干部还表示不耐烦，这是我们平时学习不够，还对工会法没有足够的认识。我们以诚恳的态度接受读者的批评，并保证今后不再发生类似情形。
    另外有几点情况须附带说明一下：
    （一）二月十三日苏南日报刊出对我们的批评后，我们在二月十五日即将检讨和答复寄往苏南日报。因未见即时刊出，我厂政治指导员郑宝礼同志曾亲去苏南日报社查询一次，当时报社同志说要用政治部名义答复。后来苏南军区政治部机构变动，就没有能迅速答复他们。
    （二）三月份厂方与工会干部协商后，即将过去的工会经费全数补缴，三月份以后也是按期缴纳的。因此这一问题现在已经解决。
    （三）从职工伙食费中抽三万元作工会经费一事，确曾有过，这是我厂工会主任孙大贤同志所提意见，因此行政和工会双方都有责任。
