　　Over a Thousand Households in Guiyang Establish Patriotic Family Pledges
    In Guiyang, Guizhou Province, many residents have established patriotic pledges within their families. According to statistics, over 1,200 households in the city have now established these patriotic family pledges. Facts have proven that these patriotic family pledges not only enhance and solidify the patriotic enthusiasm of every member within the family, promote family unity and progress, but also play a certain role in the popularization and deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The characteristic of these patriotic family pledges in Guiyang is that they combine the actual circumstances of each family and individual, proposing guarantees related to patriotic actions. Generally, these resident families are able to ensure the implementation of these patriotic family pledges after they are established. Many families regularly check their patriotic pledges and, through inspection, make necessary revisions to the pledge clauses to make them more practical. There are also some patriotic pledges of resident families in Guiyang that have become formalities without prior family deliberation and discussion, and these are currently being corrected.
    The experience in Guiyang proves that establishing and implementing patriotic family pledges is an important method to continue to deepen and expand the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement among the unorganized masses of residents. It is also an important method to combine the political tasks of the people's motherland with the work and life of each member of the family, and to promote internal family unity and progress.

　　贵阳市一千多户居民订立家庭爱国公约
    贵州省贵阳市不少居民在家庭内订立了爱国公约。据统计，现全市已有一千二百户以上的居民订立了家庭爱国公约。事实证明：这些家庭爱国公约不仅提高与巩固了家庭内每一个成员的爱国热情，促进家庭的团结和进步，而且对抗美援朝运动的普及和深入，都起了一定的作用。该市居民家庭爱国公约的特点是结合各个家庭和个人的实际情况，提出有关爱国行动的保证。这些居民家庭爱国公约订立后，一般都能保证执行。许多家庭中并定期检查爱国公约，通过检查，将公约条文作必要的修正，使其更切合实际。贵阳市居民家庭的爱国公约，也有一部分事先未经过家庭酝酿讨论而流于形式的，现正纠正中。
    贵阳市的经验证明：订立和贯彻家庭爱国公约，是在无组织的居民群众中继续深入和扩大抗美援朝爱国运动的一个重要方法，是使人民祖国的政治任务和家庭中每个成员的工作和生活结合起来，并促进家庭内部团结和进步的一个重要方法。
