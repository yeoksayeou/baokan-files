    Our Great Motherland
    Recently, four aircraft of the People's Air Force assisted farmers in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, and Sihong County, northern Anhui Province, in eliminating locusts. This is another example of the People's Air Force serving production and construction after bombing the ice dam on the Yellow River this spring. This is one of the aircraft dispatched to eliminate locusts. On June 13th, at 5:00 PM, it arrived at the fields in the locust-affected area of Huanghua County and sprayed 666 special insecticide powder at an altitude of three to seven meters above the ground, spraying an area of more than 1,000 mu per hour.

    人民空军的四架飞机，最近在河北黄骅县和皖北泗洪县境内，协助农民进行消灭蝗虫的工作。这是人民空军继今春轰炸黄河冰坝后，又一次为生产建设服务的例证。这是出动灭蝗的飞机之一，于六月十三日下午五时到达黄骅县蝗区的田野，在离地三至七公尺的上空，喷洒六六六特效药粉，每小时喷洒的面积达一千余亩。
