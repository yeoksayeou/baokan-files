　　Henan's Summer Grain Collection is About to Begin
　　Henan Province's summer harvest is nearing its end, and farmers in various regions are preparing to pay the summer public grain. Many farmers have included "Pay good grain, pay dry grain" as a clause in their patriotic covenants. Henan is a famous wheat-producing area, and the summer grain levy accounts for more than 60% of the total annual public grain levy. In order to complete the summer grain collection work well, Henan started preparations early and expects to start collecting in early July, with all public grain to be stored by the end of July.
　　The most important part of the summer grain preparation work is land survey and yield determination. Since February of this year, governments at all levels in Henan have combined land reform work with the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of farmers to universally measure land area and assess unit yields. This work has achieved great success. According to statistics from only the Xuchang, Zhengzhou, and three other special districts, the masses of farmers have identified and voluntarily reported more than 540,000 mu of unregistered land.

　　河南夏征即将开始
    河南省的夏收已近结束，各地农民正在准备缴纳夏季公粮。许多农民已经把“缴好粮、缴干粮”作为一条订入了爱国公约。河南是著名的产麦区，夏征公粮占全年应征公粮总数的百分之六十以上。为了很好地完成夏征工作，河南很早就开始准备，预计七月初可开征，七月底全部公粮就可入仓。
    夏征准备工作最重要的一项是查田定产，今年二月以来，河南各地人民政府曾结合土地改革工作，在广大农民群众的热情参加下，普遍进行丈量田亩和评定单位产量。这一工作有很大的成绩，只根据许昌、郑州等五个专区的统计，由农民群众查出和自动报出的黑田就有五十四万多亩。
