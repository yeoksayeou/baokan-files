Invigorate Rural Finance, Develop Agricultural Production
—A Record of the National Rural Financial Conference
By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Qingyun

The vast rural areas of China after the land reform have seen many gratifying new developments. The vigorously developing rural economy is constantly raising many new issues that require the state to solve. These situations are most significant in the Northeast and North China. Other regions of the country will rapidly follow the situation in the Northeast and North China today.

Last year, agricultural production in the Northeast increased by 37 percent compared to the previous year, reaching 99.48 percent of the 1943 level. The yield per hectare was 2,514 catties, exceeding 1943 by 13.93 percent. The number of livestock also increased significantly. In Shulan County, the number of draught animals totaled 29,799 in 1943, and increased to 60,303 last year, an increase of 102 percent compared to 1943. Middle peasants have become the majority of the rural population. They cultivate their own land with their own draught animals and farm implements. In the Northeast as a whole, middle peasants account for about 50 percent or more of the rural population in the new areas, and about 60 to 70 percent in the old areas. Most farmers now have surplus grain. In Jilin Province in 1950, after deducting public grain, seeds, food grain, horse feed, and all other expenses from the income of all farmers in the province, each farmer had an average surplus of 591 catties of grain (gaoliang, same below). Adding the income from sideline production of 312 catties, each person had an average purchasing power of 903 catties of grain per year. Therefore, the current issue in the rural areas of the Northeast is no longer entirely a matter of restoring production, but rather farmers demanding to sell surplus grain and local products in order to carry out expanded reproduction.

The situation in North China is similar to that in the Northeast. This can be seen from the fact that farmers already have the strength to save. The highest figure for private deposits absorbed by the People's Bank in Yu County, Chahar Province, last year was 30 million yuan. This spring, a financial work group of the bank absorbed 400 million yuan in just one month. In the People's Bank's prize-winning savings campaign in Chahar Province, 70 percent of the depositors were farmers.

In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, the income of farmers has also increased compared to before liberation after reducing rent and returning deposits or selling local products. For example, the fruits obtained by farmers in the rent reduction and deposit return campaign in the Southwest were worth 7 billion catties of grain. The income of farmers in the Central South region from selling local products last year alone exceeded 5 trillion yuan.

Farmers not only demand to sell their agricultural and sideline products, but also demand to be able to buy the means of production and means of livelihood they need. That is to say, they demand more active urban-rural exchange. On the other hand, although the economic situation of farmers has been greatly improved, their foundation is still weak, and they still need to keep a portion of grain and local products in hand to prepare for emergencies. This leaves a large part of the property in the rural areas idle and unable to be used for production.

The biggest issue of this National Rural Financial Conference is how to turn the existing materials in the rural areas into capital and make this capital active. The conference discussed issues such as promoting urban-rural exchange, invigorating rural finance, and developing agricultural production.

In the past year, the State Bank has used a large amount of funds to support state-owned trading organizations in purchasing and selling local products. As of the end of April this year, the funds provided by the State Bank in this regard accounted for about 80 percent or more of the total loans. In the past year, the State Bank provided supply and marketing cooperatives with 162 million catties of rice in long-term funds and more than 500 billion yuan in working capital. This year, the scale of domestic sales of local products is much larger than last year, and the State Bank will prepare more funds in this regard to cooperate with state-owned trading organizations and cooperatives in purchasing and selling.

Once farmers sell their surplus grain, sideline products, and local products, they will have the ability to save. The question is how to dispel their ideological concerns. Banks are very unfamiliar to many farmers. They do not know that they can get interest by depositing money in the bank, nor do they know that today's People's Bank will use this concentrated money to help them solve difficulties. Things are easy to handle once they are explained clearly. The achievements of the rural financial work group piloted by the Chahar Provincial Branch of the People's Bank best illustrate the problem. At the end of last year, the total balance of private deposits in the Chahar Provincial Branch was less than 2.5 billion yuan. After the financial work group went deep into the rural areas, it absorbed more than 4.5 billion yuan in deposits in just one month. The bank's loans during this period were 3 billion yuan, of which 70 percent was invested in agricultural production. The financial work group had a very harmonious relationship with the farmers. In Xiaonantou, Datong, the financial work group organized more than 300 farmers into 58 production mutual aid groups through loans, and bought 260 carts of fertilizer for them, so that 1,300 mu of land of 163 farmers were fertilized. When farmers saw that the financial work group was really working for them, many people voluntarily assisted the financial work group in carrying out its business. A production team leader in Chabei absorbed 5,800 catties of grain for the financial work group. This shows that conditions for carrying out savings business in rural areas have been met, and the scattered funds concentrated through savings are very considerable.

Rural insurance is also one of the important ways to regulate rural funds. This conference decided to fully develop livestock insurance business. Because livestock is a very important property of farmers, farmers are willing to insure in order to avoid accidental losses. This year, in addition to livestock insurance, the People's Insurance Company has focused on piloting cotton harvest insurance in nine provinces and cities. In addition, insurance such as poultry, fruit trees, simple life insurance, and simple fire insurance will be launched successively, as well as harvest insurance for grains such as wheat, rice, and soybeans, and harvest insurance for special crops such as sugarcane, tobacco leaves, and tung oil.

How much scattered funds can be absorbed through the development of insurance business? According to the People's Bank, if all insurance businesses from cities to rural areas across the country are developed, the accumulated funds will be equal to the amount of public grain collected by the state throughout the year. Therefore, it can be imagined how strong a fund will be concentrated and invested in agricultural production if the insurance business in rural areas is fully developed!

Developing credit cooperatives and promoting free lending is another effective way to invigorate rural finance. In some places, farmers already have a considerable amount of surplus grain. For example, in Jiefang Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, among 536 households, 2 households had more than 100 dan of surplus grain, 10 households had 40 to 50 dan, 20 households had 20 to 30 dan, 189 households had about 10 dan, 286 households had 3 to 5 dan, and only 27 households were short. With many surplus grain households and few grain-deficient households, the difficulty can be easily solved with proper adjustment. And this requires an organizer. Credit cooperatives are the best organizational form. The pilot credit cooperatives in Ding County, Hebei Province last year have been supported by farmers. Last year, Ding County credit cooperatives organized funds equivalent to about 1.3 million catties of grain. These funds were used in agriculture, including fertilizing 4,740 mu, sowing 667 mu, purchasing 617 livestock, adding 79 carts, and more than 200 farm implements. In terms of sideline industries, 18 family textile groups, 14 flour mills, 24 oil mills, 11 wood factories, 9 tofu workshops, and 12 cotton ginning factories were supported, as well as 21 pig farms. In terms of industry, 38 waterwheel factories and 32 brick kilns were supported. In addition, the farmers were helped to build water conservancy projects. The business of the credit cooperative is closely linked to the farmers' production requirements. A portion of agricultural products or funds stagnant in the countryside can be exchanged within the same region or between different regions through the organization of the credit cooperative. Therefore, credit cooperatives need a lot of support and promotion from the State Bank.

The methods mentioned above can only solve a part of the farmers' problems at present. The problem of large and concentrated funds needed by farmers to improve technology and increase production still needs to be solved by the state. The conference also made a decision on this: in the future, the State Bank's lending work will be divided into two parts, one part is the agricultural production loans with a larger amount, and the other part is the general revolving loans with a smaller amount. The former is mainly to improve agricultural technology, such as building larger water conservancy projects, improving soil to increase land fertility, promoting improved varieties, and promoting the use of new farm implements; at the same time, in line with the state's overall economic plan, providing special raw materials needed for industrial production, such as issuing special product loans for cotton, tobacco leaves, and hemp. The latter is short-term loans to small-scale industry and commerce and handicrafts in urban and rural areas, as well as loans to solve the temporary difficulties of farmers in life.

Faced with such a new situation in rural economic development, the conference made these timely decisions. It is believed that the implementation of these decisions will promote greater development of the rural economy.

　　活泼农村金融，发展农业生产
     ——记全国农村金融会议
    新华社记者李庆云
    土地改革后的中国广大农村出现了许多可喜的新情况。蓬勃发展着的农村经济正不断提出许多新问题要求国家来解决。这些情况以东北和华北为最显著。全国其他地区，也将迅速跟着出现像今天东北和华北的情况。
    去年东北农业生产量已较前年增加百分之三十七，达一九四三年百分之九十九点四八。每垧地的产量为二千五百十四斤，超过了一九四三年百分之十三点九三。牲畜数量也有很大的增加。舒兰县一九四三年共有耕畜两万九千七百九十九头，去年增加到六万零三百零三头，较一九四三年增加了百分之一百零二。中农已成为农村人口中的大多数。他们用自己的耕畜和农具来耕种自己的土地。就全东北来说，新区中农约占农村人口的百分之五十以上，老区约占百分之六十到七十。现在大部分农民都有了余粮。吉林省一九五○年全省农民的收入除掉公粮、种籽、口粮、马料等一切开支外，每个农民平均余粮五百九十一斤（高粱，下同），加上副业生产收入三百十二斤，平均每人一年有九百零三斤粮食的购买力。因此目前东北农村已不完全是恢复生产的问题，而是农民要求出卖余粮和土产，以便进行扩大再生产的问题了。
    华北情况也与东北相似。这只要从农民已有力量进行储蓄这件事就可看出。人民银行去年在察哈尔省蔚县吸收的私人存款最高的数字是三千万元，今年春天，该行的一个金融工作小组在短短一个月内就吸收了四亿元存款。人民银行在察哈尔省举办的有奖储蓄，百分之七十的存户都是农民。
    尚未进行土地改革的地区，农民经过减租退押或销出了土产，收入也都较解放前增加了。如西南减租退押中农民得到的果实就值七十亿斤粮食。中南区的农民去年仅仅卖掉土产的收入就在五万亿元以上。
    农民不但要求推销自己的农、副业产品，而且要求能够买到需要的生产资料和生活资料。就是说要求城乡交流更加活跃。另一方面，农民的经济情况虽然已经大大改善，但是毕竟家底还薄，手中还要留存一部分粮食、土产准备应付急需。这样就使得农村中有很大一部分财产被搁置起来，不能用于生产。
    这次全国农村金融会议的最大的课题，就是如何把农村已有的物资变成资金，并使这些资金活动起来。这次会议讨论了促进城乡交流，活泼农村金融，发展农业生产等问题。
    过去一年来，国家银行曾以大量资金支持国营贸易机构收购和推销土产。到今年四月底止，国家银行在这方面所供给的资金，约占贷款总额的百分之八十以上。去年一年内，国家银行对供销合作社供给了一亿六千二百万斤米的长期资金和五千多亿元的周转资金。今年土产内销的规模比去年大得多，国家银行在这方面将准备更多的资金来配合国营贸易机构和合作社进行收购和推销工作。
    农民手中的余粮、副产、土产等销出去了，他们就有了储蓄能力。问题是如何打开他们的思想顾虑。银行对许多农民来说是十分陌生的。他们不知道把钱存在银行还会得到利钱，也不知道今天人民的银行会把这些集中起来的钱用来帮助他们解决困难。事情说明白了就好办了。人民银行察哈尔省分行试办的农村金融工作小组的成就最足以说明问题。去年年底，察哈尔省分行的私人存款余额总共不足二十五亿元，金融工作小组深入农村后，仅仅一个月就吸收了存款四十五亿元以上。银行这个时期的放款是三十亿元，其中百分之七十投在农业生产上面。金融工作小组与农民的关系十分融洽。在大同小南头，金融工作小组通过放款组织农民三百多人成立五十八个生产互助组，为他们买了二百六十大车肥料，使一百六十三户农民的一千三百亩地都施上肥了。农民看到金融工作小组真是为他们办事来的，就有许多人自动协助金融工作小组开展业务。察北一个生产小组长就为金融工作小组吸收存粮五千八百斤。这说明在农村中开展储蓄业务已具备了条件，而通过储蓄集中起来的零散资金是十分可观的。
    农村保险也是调剂农村资金的重要办法之一。这次会议决定全面开展牲畜保险业务。因为牲畜是农民极重要的财产，为了避免遭受意外的损失，农民是愿意来投保的。今年，除掉牲畜保险以外，人民保险公司已在九个省市重点试办棉花收获保险。另外还将陆续举办家禽、果树、简易人寿、简易火灾等种保险，以及小麦、水稻、大豆等粮食的收获保险和甘蔗、烟叶、桐油等特产作物的收获保险。
    通过举办保险业务所能吸收的零星资金有多少呢？据人民银行计算，若把全国从城市到农村的各项保险业务都开展起来，这笔积聚的资金将等于全年国家所征公粮的数字。因此可以设想，农村中的保险业务如果充分开展，将集中起来一笔多么雄厚的资金投入农业生产！
    开展信用合作和推动自由借贷是活泼农村金融的另一个有效办法。有些地方，农民已有相当多的余粮。如吉林省榆树县解放村五百三十六户中，余粮在一百石以上的有二户，四十石到五十石的十户，二十石到三十石的二十户，十石左右的一百八十九户，三到五石的二百八十六户，不足的仅二十七户。余粮户多，缺粮户少，只要作适当的调剂，困难就很容易解决。而这中间需要一个组织者。信用合作社就是一个最好的组织形式。河北省定县去年试办信用合作社已得到农民的拥护。去年一年中，定县信用合作社共组织了约合一百三十万斤粮食的资金，这些资金用在农业方面，计施肥四千七百四十亩，下种六百六十七亩，购买牲口六百十七头，添置大车七十九辆，农具二百余件。副业方面，扶植了家庭纺织组十八个，粉坊十四家，油坊二十四家，木厂十一个，豆腐坊九家，轧花厂十二家，养猪的二十一家。工业方面，扶植水车厂三十八家，砖窑三十二家。此外还帮助农民兴修了水利。信用合作社的业务是与农民的生产要求密切结合着的。农村里呆滞着的一部农产品或资金，经过信用合作社的组织，可以在同一地区内或不同地区间交流起来。所以信用合作社需要国家银行来大量扶助和推动。
    上面所说的这些办法，目前还只能解决农民的一部分问题，农民在提高技术、提高生产方面需要的较大较集中的资金供应问题仍然需要国家来解决。这次会议对此也作了决定：今后国家银行的放款工作分为两部分，一部分是为数较大的农业生产放款，一部分是数量较小的一般周转性放款。前者主要是为了提高农业技术，例如兴修较大的水利工程，改良土壤增加地力，推广优良品种，提倡使用新式农具等；同时配合国家整个经济计划，提供工业生产所需的特种原料，如发放棉花、烟叶、麻等特产放款。后者是对城乡的小型工商业、手工业的短期放款，以及解决农民生活上暂时困难的放款。
    面对着这样一个农村经济发展的新情况，会议作出了这些适合时宜的决定。相信这些决定的贯彻执行，将促使农村经济更加发展。
