In view of the vast territory of our country and the extremely uneven development of agricultural economies in various regions, it is currently impossible to implement a unified agricultural tax rate. Moreover, most areas in the newly liberated areas have completed land reform. Therefore, certain provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Central People's Government in September 1950 must be appropriately revised and supplemented. The existing agricultural tax laws in other newly liberated areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, as well as in old liberated areas where land reform has been implemented for a long time, should also be revised appropriately based on the new situation to suit local conditions. For this reason, with the approval of the Chairman of the Central People's Government, the following instructions are issued:

    1. Old liberated areas (including Northeast, Inner Mongolia, North China, and the old liberated areas of Shandong in East China, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia in Northwest China) will continue to adopt the proportional tax system. If the current agricultural tax law is not entirely suitable for the new local conditions and needs to be revised, the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) may revise it as appropriate and submit it to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation. If the agricultural tax law in the North China Region needs to be revised, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government may revise it as appropriate and submit it to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.

    2. In newly liberated areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Central People's Government in September 1950 will continue to be used. If these regulations are not entirely suitable for the specific local conditions and need to be revised, the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) may revise them as appropriate and submit them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.

    3. In newly liberated areas that have completed land reform, the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" will generally continue to be used. However, to conform to the new situation after land reform, in addition to Article 22 of the regulations being revised in accordance with Article 4 of these instructions, Articles 12, 15, and 16 also need to be revised and supplemented. The revisions and supplements are as follows:
        (1) The agricultural tax rate will still adopt a progressive system on the full amount, with a maximum not exceeding 30% and a minimum not less than 5%. Within this limit, the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) will formulate a tax rate table based on the specific local conditions and submit it to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for approval and implementation.
        (2) Agricultural tax on rented land and tenanted land will be calculated and levied separately based on the respective incomes of the landlord and tenant, according to the applicable rates. If there is a prior agreement, it may be calculated and levied according to the agreement. Income from rented land and income from tenanted land will be calculated at 100 jin for every 100 jin, without any addition or reduction.
        (3) In accordance with the provisions of the Land Reform Law, if a poor peasant household with one or two members receives more land than is appropriate for one or two people, when calculating agricultural tax, a one-person household may be calculated as a two-person household, and a two-person household may be calculated as a three-person household, in order to provide consideration.

    4. The local surcharge on agricultural tax in all regions of the country shall not exceed 20% of the regular tax and shall be levied together with the agricultural tax.

    5. People's governments at all levels must strictly calculate and levy taxes in accordance with the tax rates approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and shall not increase or decrease them at will.

    6. The Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) must, in accordance with the "Implementation Outline for Agricultural Tax Land Survey and Production Determination Work" issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, guide the People's Governments of the provinces (municipalities) under their jurisdiction to promote land survey and production determination work with leadership and planning, and instruct the financial departments of each region to submit a special report to the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government every six months. It is required that old liberated areas with a better work foundation, such as North China, Shandong, and the Northeast, should first achieve the reality and stability of production.

    7. The collection of agricultural tax, in addition to ensuring the necessary grain for the state, requires the collection of some economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco, and cash, when necessary and possible. The financial departments of the central government and the greater administrative regions should, together with the relevant departments such as trade departments, cooperatives, and the People's Bank, negotiate and determine contracts for economic crops to offset grain contributions and specific measures for collecting currency, in accordance with reasonable price ratios.

    8. In order to do a good job in agricultural tax collection, when the grain collection season arrives, the responsible comrades of people's governments and financial departments at all levels are required to take personal leadership, mobilize necessary forces, conduct extensive and in-depth publicity, and urge grain collection workers at all levels to abide by policies, ensure the correct implementation of agricultural tax laws, and achieve the full achievement of agricultural tax estimates. It is required that the Greater Administrative Region People's Governments (Military and Administrative Committees) strengthen the financial departments and agricultural tax collection agencies at all levels, and cultivate cadres for agricultural tax collection work in a planned manner.

　　政务院关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示
    鉴于我国幅员广大，各地区农业经济发展极不平衡，目前尚不可能实施统一的农业税率，加以新解放区的大部地区业已完成土地改革，因而，一九五○年九月中央人民政府公布的《新解放区农业税暂行条例》的若干条文必须加以适当的修正和补充。其他尚未实行土地改革的新解放区及早已实行土地改革的老解放区，其现行农业税法，亦得根据新的情况酌予修订，俾能适合当地情况。为此特报请中央人民政府主席批准，作如下指示：
    一、老解放区（包括东北、内蒙、华北和华东的山东、西北的陕甘宁老解放区在内），仍采比例税制，现行农业税法如有不完全适合当地新的情况而需要修改时，得由各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）酌予修订，报中央人民政府政务院核准施行。华北区农业税法需要修改时得由中央人民政府财政部酌予修订，报中央人民政府政务院核准施行。
    二、新解放区尚未实行土地改革的地区，仍沿用一九五○年九月中央人民政府公布的《新解放区农业税暂行条例》，该条例如有不完全适合当地具体情况而需要修改时，得由各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）酌予修订，报中央人民政府政务院核准施行。
    三、新解放区已完成土地改革的地区，一般仍沿用《新解放区农业税暂行条例》，惟为符合土地改革后的新情况，除该条例第二十二条应依本指示第四条予以修正外，其第十二、十五、十六各条亦有修正和补充的必要，特予修正补充如下：
        （一）农业税税率仍采用全额累进制，最高不得超过百分之三十，最
    低不得少于百分之五，在此限度内由各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）
    根据当地具体情况拟订税率表，报中央人民政府政务院核准施行。
        （二）出租地和佃耕地的农业税，按业佃双方各自收入，分别依率计
    征；事先有协议者得依其协议计征。出租地收入和佃耕地收入，一百斤均
    作一百斤计算，不再加成或减成。
        （三）凡依照土地改革法的规定，一口人或两口人的贫苦农户分得多
    于一口人或两口人的土地，在计算农业税时，一口人的农户得按两口人计
    算农业人口，两口人的农户得按三口人计算农业人口，以资照顾。
    四、全国各地区农业税地方附加，不得超过正税百分之二十，随同农业税附征之。
    五、各级人民政府必须严格依照中央人民政府政务院核准的税率计征，不得自由增加或减少。
    六、各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）须依照中央人民政府财政部所发《农业税查田订产工作实施纲要》，指导所属各省（市）人民政府有领导有计划地推行查田订产工作，并责成各该区财政部门每半年向中央人民政府财政部作一次专题报告。要求华北、山东、东北等工作基础较好的老解放区，首先作到产量的真实和固定。
    七、农业税的征收，除保证国家必需的粮食外，要求在必要和可能条件下，征收一部分棉、麻、烟等经济作物和现款。中央及各大行政区的财政部门应与贸易部门、合作社、人民银行等有关部门，依照合理的比价，分别商定经济作物抵交公粮的合同，和征收货币的具体办法执行之。
    八、为做好农业税收工作，在征粮季节到来时，要求各级人民政府和财政部门的负责同志亲自领导，动员必要力量，进行广泛深入的宣传并督促各级征粮工作人员恪守政策，保证农业税法的正确执行和农业税概算的圆满达成。要求各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）加强各级财政部门和农业税的征收机构，并有计划地培养农业税收工作的干部。
              总理  周恩来
              一九五一年六月二十一日
