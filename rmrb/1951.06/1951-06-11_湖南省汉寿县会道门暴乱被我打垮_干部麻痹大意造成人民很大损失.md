　　The Huidomen Riot in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, Was Crushed by Us
    Cadre Negligence Caused Great Losses to the People
    In mid-April, Hanshou County, Hunan Province, cracked down on an armed riot case involving the reactionary Huidomen "Religious Philosophy Research Society," killing 50 bandits including the ringleaders Zhou Kechuan and Wang Shijin, and capturing ringleaders Xiang Haibin, Li Huade, Zhou Taishan, and over 400 bandits. The ringleader Zhou Kechuan was from Shanghua Village, Fifth District, Hanshou County, 50 years old, nicknamed "Black Beard," and was a Yiguandao "point transmitter." After the liberation of Hanshou County, Zhou Kechuan and others used the feudal superstitious organization "Religious Philosophy Research Society" to develop reactionary organizations, organizing soldiers and ruffians to engage in secret activities; they also created rumors to deceive some backward masses into joining the society. After February of this year, the bandits held several secret meetings to plan the organization of reactionary armed forces, discussing how to riot. They also instructed bandits Li Huade, Guo Daoyun, Zhou Dalun, and others to infiltrate our village-level organizations, attempting to control the masses and expand reactionary forces. At the same time, the bandits actively rushed to make weapons such as spiked darts.
    On April 13th, more than 300 bandits (mostly society members and released counter-revolutionary criminals) gathered at the home of bandit Wang Shijing, and at midnight, they attacked the Yaxi Township government. After the bandits broke into the Yaxi Township government, they tied up the township head and deputy head, Zhou Wenjie and Deng Chunjie, and the chairman of the Farmers' Association, Mao Hongyuan, forcing them to join the society, and burned various documents. Then the bandits attacked the Yougang police station, killing more than ten militiamen, guards, and members of the county brigade production team, and released 72 imprisoned illegal landlords and other counter-revolutionaries, some of whom joined the riot at that time. When more than ten bandits were killed or wounded by us, and bandit Xiang Haibin was wounded by us, the bandits, seeing that "magic water cannot ward off swords and guns," began to waver and dispersed.
    After the news of the riot spread, the next day (April 14th), the Hanshou County People's Government and the Fifth and Sixth District governments each sent armed forces, cooperating with local militia to encircle and suppress the bandits. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, bandit Zhou fled to Taibai Township. At that time, 12 bandits including bandit Wang Shijin were killed by us, and two were injured. On the 16th, another batch of troops arrived, distributing leaflets along the way, launching a political propaganda offensive against the bandits, calling on bandits and coerced people to register and surrender; at the same time, they organized the masses to report and assist the government in capturing scattered bandits. On the same day, more than 200 bandits were captured, and 50 to 60 people were cleared and released in a timely manner.
    The occurrence of this incident is mainly due to the fact that special agents, reactionary landlords, and reactionary Huidomen are trying to make a last-ditch struggle; and our cadres are negligent and inattentive, failing to strictly control counter-revolutionaries, and lacking vigilance against their retaliatory conspiracies, which also gave the bandits an opportunity to take advantage of.

　　湖南省汉寿县
　　会道门暴乱被我打垮        
    干部麻痹大意造成人民很大损失
    湖南省汉寿县四月中旬破获反动会道门“宗教哲学研究社”武装暴乱案，击毙匪首周克传、王世锦以下五十人，捕获匪首项海滨、李华德、周太山等及匪众四百多人。匪首周克传系汉寿县五区上花村人，现年五十岁，绰号“黑胡子”，为一贯道点传师。汉寿县解放后，周匪克传等即利用封建迷信团体“宗教哲学研究社”发展反动组织，组织兵痞、流氓，秘密活动；又制造谣言，欺骗一部分落后群众入社。今年二月以后，匪首多次秘密开会，筹划组织反动武装，商量如何暴乱。又指使李匪华德、郭匪道蕴、周匪大伦等打入我村级组织，企图掌握群众，扩大反动势力。与此同时，匪徒们积极赶制鋑镖等武器。
    四月十三日，匪众三百多人（多系社徒及被释放后的反革命罪犯）会合于王匪石景家中，夜半时分向我亚西乡政府进犯。匪徒们打入亚西乡政府后，捆起正副乡长周文阶、邓春阶及农民协会主席毛洪源，强迫他们入社，并烧毁了各种文件。接着匪众就向酉港派出所进犯，杀死民兵、门卫、县大队生产班队员等十余人，并放出在押不法地主及其他反革命分子七十二人，其中有一部分当时就参加了暴乱。当匪徒被我打死打伤十余人、项匪海滨为我击伤后，匪众见“符水不能避刀枪”，开始动摇，纷纷跑散。
    暴乱消息传出后，次日（四月十四日），汉寿县人民政府及第五、六区政府各派武装部队，配合以当地民兵会剿匪徒。周匪见势不敌，向太白乡溃逃。当时被我击毙匪首王世锦以下十二人，伤二人。十六日另一批部队赶到，沿途散发传单，向匪众展开政治宣传攻势，号召匪徒及胁从分子登记自首；一面又组织群众检举和协助政府捕捉散匪。当天就捕捉匪徒二百余人，及时清理释放五、六十人。
    这一事件的发生，主要是特务、反动地主、反动会道门企图垂死挣扎；而我干部麻痹大意，对反革命分子管制不严，对其报复阴谋缺乏警惕，也给了匪徒们以可乘之机。（王又民）
