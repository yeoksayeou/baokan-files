How the Xinxiang Private Chenxing Yarn Factory Trade Union Implemented the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit and Developing Production
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Du Wenyuan
　　Over the past year, the trade union of the Xinxiang Private Chenxing Yarn Factory in Pingyuan Province has implemented the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. Despite the extremely dilapidated machinery, the daily output (20 hours) of 20-count yarn per spindle has increased from 0.58 pounds to 0.85 pounds. Along with the increase in production, the lives and welfare of the employees have also been appropriately improved.
            
            Correcting the Two Deviations of Only Focusing on Production or Only Focusing on Welfare; Correctly Grasping the Policy of Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit and Developing Production
　　Before liberation, the factory's management was extremely chaotic, coupled with dilapidated machinery, resulting in extremely low production efficiency. The daily output per spindle was only 0.58 pounds, which was more than 40% lower than that of ordinary yarn factories. After the liberation of Xinxiang in 1949, the factory established a trade union, abolished the body search system and various unreasonable punishment systems, and workers began to hold their heads high. However, the old unreasonable systems had not been completely abolished, and the workers' enthusiasm for production had not been fully unleashed. At first, the trade union cadres neglected to lead production, focusing solely on welfare, believing that leading production was solely the responsibility of the capitalists. Later, this deviation was corrected; however, it then moved towards another deviation: simply emphasizing production without leading workers to resolve welfare issues that could be resolved. In carrying out various tasks, the trade union cadres often became detached from the masses. For example, at the end of 1949, without consulting with the workers and staff, the year-end double pay was reduced, and the year-end bonus was cancelled, which workers were very dissatisfied with. The trade union preparatory committee's office was deserted, and workers complained behind the trade union's back, saying: "The trade union cannot solve problems." Trade union cadres said to the workers: "We must look at long-term interests." Workers said: "We can't even get current benefits, how can we look at long-term interests!" The trade union work stagnated.
    Last April, the trade union cadres of the factory studied the People's Daily editorial of February 7, "Learn to Manage Enterprises," and later studied the report of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Production Conference, which ideologically resolved the issue of "producing for whom" and clarified the relationship between production and welfare. At a time when the factory's business situation was relatively difficult, the trade union, representing the workers and staff, took the initiative to propose to the capitalists that working hours be temporarily increased from ten hours to eleven hours (wages were also increased by five per thousand). After the increase in working hours, the trade union led the workers to demand that the capitalists resolve welfare issues that could be resolved. For example, a bathhouse, dining hall, and nursing room were built, the amount of medicine in the clinic was increased, and the problems of workers' haircuts and drinking water were solved. For the first time, workers saw their demands being resolved relatively satisfactorily, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased, with the daily output per spindle reaching 0.65 pounds. Workers were also willing to participate in trade union work.
    After the trade union's work policy was corrected, the trade union promoted trade union cadres from among the workers, strengthened the connection between the trade union and the masses, and established the trade union's prestige among the masses.
            
            Using Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings to Unite Capitalists and Improve Production
    When the labor-capital consultation meeting was established, the capitalists wanted to further increase production through the labor-capital consultation meeting; however, they refused to resolve the issue of employee welfare, citing the factory's difficulties. Based on the policy of "labor-capital mutual benefit and developing production," the trade union convened a meeting of employee representatives to gather the opinions of employees and elected representatives to participate in the labor-capital consultation meeting. At the meeting, employee representatives put forward many suggestions for improving production, such as repairing machines and establishing a reward and punishment system, and also raised demands for improving employees' lives. In mid-July last year, the labor-capital consultation meeting was formally established. During the consultation, the parties adopted resolutions on summarizing and selecting model workers, repairing machines, and improving the wage system, that is, the trade union guaranteed that the daily output per spindle would reach 0.69 pounds in September and October; and the capitalists guaranteed to take out a portion of the bonus. Since then, labor-capital consultation meetings have been held monthly, and the trade union has been able to unite capitalists and carry out production in a more planned manner.
            
            Conducting Patriotic Education on Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Employees Establish a New Attitude Towards Labor
    The trade union implemented the agreement of the labor-capital consultation meeting and led employees to carry out labor competitions. First, the trade union mobilized employees to discuss the issue of "producing for whom," enlightening the workers to realize that doing a good job in production in private enterprises is also beneficial to our country's economic construction, thus establishing a new attitude towards labor. Before liberation, workers were exploited and disgusted with labor, so they would squat in the toilet for half a day even if they didn't have to go; if cotton fell on the ground, they would kick it under the machine. After understanding who production was for, the workers became very fond of the machines and raw materials. During rest, they would also check their machines, and they would pick up every small bundle of cotton that fell on the ground. The yarn reeling workers used to not reel "small yarn" (if the yarn that could not be reeled was broken, they would tear it up), but now they would join even a little bit of yarn, knowing that every inch of yarn was earned through labor and was part of the country's wealth.
    On this ideological basis, model workers were summarized and selected, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. At first, some people thought this was "picking faults." The trade union first affirmed achievements; dispelled concerns about losing their jobs, etc.; Communist Party members and Youth League members took the lead in making self-criticism, and each group specifically analyzed the ideological situation of various workers in the group and solved them. Those who were able to accept criticism slightly were commended on the blackboard newspaper to seek continued progress. After summarizing and selecting model workers, the workers further established a new attitude towards labor and formulated future work plans. In the ten days of selecting model workers, the output increased to 0.69 pounds.
    At the end of last year, the trade union of the factory carried out patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. Through pouring out grievances, the workers' political awareness was further improved. Encouraged by patriotic enthusiasm, the workers' enthusiasm for production was even higher. Focusing on the main shortcomings in production at that time, the trade union put forward the goal of "reducing the rate of downtime and stoppage, improving technology, and strengthening safety production." Production groups in the workshops were mobilized to challenge the Ma Hengchang group. So far, there has been a significant improvement in output and quality, and there have also been improvements in technology. Originally, one drawframe operator looked after one section, but now it has been increased to one operator looking after two sections; originally, two roving frame operators looked after one machine, but now it has been increased to one operator looking after one machine.
    Currently, Lu Dinghua, the manager of the factory, has begun to see the power of the workers and the trade union. He said: "To do a good job in production, we must implement labor-capital mutual benefit, give full play to the wisdom of the workers, absorb rationalization proposals, abolish unreasonable systems, and improve management methods."

　　新乡私营成兴纱厂工会怎样贯彻了劳资两利发展生产的政策？
    本报特约记者  杜文远
    平原省新乡市私营成兴纱厂工会，一年来执行了发展生产、劳资两利的政策，在机器极端破旧的情况下，使每锭每日（二十小时）二十支纱的产量由○·五八磅提高到了○·八五磅。随着生产的提高，职工生活与福利事业也得到适当改善。
            纠正只搞生产只搞福利两种偏向  正确掌握劳资两利发展生产政策
    该厂在解放前，经营管理极端混乱，再加机器破旧，生产效率极低，每锭日产量仅为○·五八磅，比一般纱厂产量低百分之四十以上。一九四九年新乡解放后，该厂建立了工会，废除了搜身制和各种不合理的惩罚制度，工人开始抬起头来；但旧的不合理的制度还未彻底废除，工人的生产积极性并未充分发挥。该厂的工会干部开始曾忽视领导生产，单纯搞福利，认为领导生产只是资本家的事。后来纠正了这一偏向；但又走向另一偏向：单纯强调生产，而没有领导工人解决可能解决的福利问题。在进行各种工作中，工会干部常常脱离群众，如一九四九年底，未与工人职员商量，就减了年终双薪，取消了年终奖励金，工人很不满意。工会筹备委员会的办公室里冷冷清清，工人在背后瞒怨工会说：“工会不能解决问题。”工会干部向工人说：“要看远大利益。”工人说：“当前利益还得不到哩，还看远大利益哩！”工会工作呈现停滞状态。
    去年四月，该厂工会干部学习了人民日报二月七日“学会管理企业”的社论，后又学习了全国总工会生产会议的报告，从思想上解决了“为谁生产”的问题，明确了生产与福利的相互关系。在当时厂内经营情况较困难的时候，工会代表工人和职员主动向资方提出工时由十小时暂增至十一小时（工资亦增加千分之五）。在增加工时以后，工会又领导工人要求资方解决了可能解决的福利问题。如修了澡塘、饭厅、喂奶房，增加了诊疗所的药品，并解决了工人理发、喝水的问题。工人第一次看到自己的要求得到较圆满的解决，生产情绪大为提高，每锭日产量达到○·六五磅。工人也都愿意参加工会工作了。
    工会工作方针端正后，工会又从工人中提拔了工会干部，加强了工会与群众的联系，也树立起工会在群众中的威信。
            运用劳资协商会议团结资方搞好生产
    劳资协商会议成立时，资方想通过劳资协商会议，进一步提高生产；而对职工福利问题，则以厂内困难为借口而不予解决。工会根据“劳资两利发展生产”的政策，召开职工代表会议，集中职工意见，并选出了参加劳资协商会议的代表。会上职工代表提出了许多改进生产的意见，如检修机器，建立奖惩制度等，同时也提出了改善职工生活的要求。去年七月中旬劳资协商会议正式成立。在协商中间，通过了总结评选模范、检修机器、改进工资制度等，即工会保证在九、十月份每锭日产量达到○·六九磅；资方保证拿出一部分奖励金。此后，劳资协商会议按月召开，工会能够更有计划地团结资方进行生产。
            进行抗美援朝爱国教育职工树立新的劳动态度
    工会执行劳资协商会议的协议，领导职工开展了劳动竞赛。首先工会发动职工讨论了“为谁生产”的问题，启发工友们认识到在私营企业中搞好生产，对于我们国家的经济建设同样有利，因此树立起了新的劳动态度。在解放前，工人被人剥削，厌恶劳动，因此上厕所没屎也蹲半天；掉在地下的棉花，一脚就踢到车底下。工人在了解到生产为了谁以后，对于机器和原料非常爱惜，休息的时候还检查自己的机器，地上掉下一小束白花都要拾起来，摇纱工人过去不摇“小纱”（摇不完的纱断了，就撕坏），现在有一点纱也要接上，他们知道每一寸纱都是用劳动换来的，都是国家的财富的一部分。
    在这一思想基础上进行了总结评选模范，开展了批评与自我批评。开始，有些人认为这是“挑毛病”。工会便首先肯定成绩；解除怕失业等等顾虑；共产党员、青年团员带头作自我批评，各小组并具体分析了组内各种工人的思想情况，加以解决。稍能接受批评即在黑板报上加以表扬，以求继续进步。经过总结评选模范，工友们进一步树立了新的劳动态度，订出了今后工作计划，评选模范的十天中，产量提高到了○·六九磅。
    去年年底，该厂工会进行了抗美援朝爱国主义教育，通过诉苦进一步提高了工人的政治觉悟，在爱国主义热情鼓舞下，工人生产情绪更加高涨。工会针对当时生产上的主要缺点提出了“减低停工停车率，提高技术，加强安全生产”的奋斗目标。发动车间生产小组向马恒昌小组应战。至目前为止，产量质量已有显著的提高，技术方面也有改进，原来并条车一人看一节，现已提高到一人看两节；粗纱原来二人看一台，现已提高到一人看一台。
    目前，该厂经理鲁定华已开始看到工人与工会的力量，他说：“要想搞好生产，必须实行劳资两利，发挥工人的智慧，吸取合理化建议，取消不合理的制度，改善经营管理方法。”
