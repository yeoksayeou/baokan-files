　　Chinese Laborers on the Korean Battlefield
    Tang Hai
    On the Korean battlefield, tens of thousands of Chinese laborers volunteering to resist America and aid Korea are indispensable helpers to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They work actively and selflessly, ensuring a steady supply of ammunition and food to the front lines.
    The heroic deeds of the laborers are endless. The characteristics of their work are: long working hours, heavy loads, long distances traveled, hard living conditions, and insufficient sleep. But the biggest characteristic is that no matter how difficult and arduous, they complete their tense and heavy transportation tasks every day. Wu Kuijiang, a farmer from Fengcheng County, Northeast China, said: "We all understand why we came to resist America and aid Korea. If we don't do our job well, we will not only let down the elders and brothers at home, but also let ourselves down."
    Wu Kuijiang is a 25-year-old young man. Under the rule of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries, he had nothing and worked as a hired hand. After liberation, his family was allocated 30 mu of land, and life became better. When the American devils advanced to the Yalu River, threatening the safety of our China, Wu Kuijiang said: "How can we live the kind of life we had under the rule of the Japanese and the reactionaries again?" So he voluntarily joined the volunteer labor brigade to resist America and aid Korea. While working in Korea, he could carry 200 jin each time. He went out on duty every night and never rested. He said: "Compared with the soldiers fighting on the front lines, what are we?"
    Other laborers are just like Wu Kuijiang. Their work efficiency is constantly improving. Their work efficiency in unloading a cart of supplies has increased sevenfold, while the number of workers needed has been reduced by one-third. The laborers especially cherish the supplies. They sew up the leaking rice sacks, nail up the broken biscuit boxes, and sweep up the rice and biscuits that fall on the ground and hand them over to the warehouse. When supplies are bombed by enemy planes, the laborers bravely rush to rescue them, thus greatly reducing the loss of supplies.
    When transferring the wounded, the laborers try to reduce the suffering of the wounded as much as possible, so they try not to change shoulders and reduce the vibration of the stretcher. When encountering enemy air raids, they first hide the wounded, preferring to sacrifice themselves rather than let the wounded suffer losses. When the weather is cold, they are afraid that the wounded will freeze, so they take off their cotton coats and cover them. When resting on the road, they jump around to keep warm.
    During the day, after resting, the laborers help Korean farmers sweep the yards, carry water, and plant fields.
    The Chinese volunteer laborers on the Korean front are working day and night like this, using their blood and sweat to create conditions for the victory of the front line.

　　朝鲜战场上的中国民工们
    唐海
    在朝鲜战场上数以万计的志愿抗美援朝的中国民工们，是中国人民志愿军的不可缺少的助手。他们积极忘我地工作着，保证了前线弹药粮食的源源供应。
    民工们的英勇事迹是说不完的。他们工作的特点是：工作时间长，扛的东西重，走的路多，生活艰苦，睡眠不足。但是最大的一个特点是不管怎样艰难困苦，他们每天都完成了紧张繁重的运输任务。来自东北凤城县的农民吴奎强说：“我们都懂得我们为什么出来抗美援朝的。要是工作做得不好，不要说对不起国内的父老兄弟，也对不起自己。”
    吴奎强是个二十五岁的小伙子。在日本鬼子和国民党反动派统治下，他一无所有，给人当雇工。解放以后他一家分得了三十亩地，生活好过了。当美国鬼子进抵鸭绿江边，威胁着我们中国的安全的时候，吴奎强说：“我们怎么能够再过日本人和反动派统治时候那样的生活？”于是他自动参加了抗美援朝民工大队。在朝鲜工作的时候，他每一次可以扛二百斤。他每夜出勤，从未休息过。他说：“比起前方作战的将士，我们算得了什么？”
    旁的民工们也和吴奎强一样。他们的工作效率不断地提高着。他们卸一车物资的工作效率已提高了七倍，而需要的工作人数却减少了三分之一。民工们特别爱护物资，他们把漏了的装米的麻袋缝好，把破了的装饼干的箱子钉好，还把落在地上的米和饼干扫起来缴到仓库里去。在物资受到敌机轰炸的时候，民工们就奋不顾身地去抢救，因而大大减少了物资的损失。
    在转运伤员的时候，民工们尽量减轻伤员们的痛苦，因此他们尽可能不换肩，减少担架的震荡。遇到敌机袭击，他们首先将伤员隐蔽起来，宁可自己牺牲，也不使伤员受到损失。天气冷，他们怕伤员受冻，脱下自己的棉袄盖在伤员身上。路上休息的时候，他们自己就跳来跳去，借以取暖。
    在白天，民工们休息之后，就帮助朝鲜农家打扫院子、挑水、种地。
    在朝鲜前线的中国志愿民工们就是这样日日夜夜地劳动着，用自己的血和汗，替前线的胜利创造着条件。
