The Ma Hengchang Group
    Achieves Challenge Conditions Again in May
    The Ma Hengchang Group once again achieved the challenge conditions proposed to workers nationwide in May. The entire group completed the monthly production task four days and six hours ahead of schedule in May; the product quality reached 99.7%; one tool was improved, two tools were created, the production time of five types of work was shortened, and the attendance rate reached 99.2%.
    In May, the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau's high-speed cutting method promotion team opened a training class in their factory. Group members Tong Junshan, Yi Kuiyuan, and Hong Yulian participated in the study and achieved excellent results in the exams. Yi Kuiyuan scored full marks in both the preliminary theory and preliminary operation exams. After they spread their learning experience within the group, everyone became more familiar with the maintenance and use of Soviet lathes. For example, the work efficiency of Zhao Diankui and Wu Jingfu in machining gears using high-speed cutting methods has increased by two to four times. In addition, they also studied and discussed the Kovalev working method with technicians and achieved preliminary results in practical work. For example, it originally took Hong Yulian 14 minutes and 30 seconds to do a certain job, but Yi Kuiyuan only needed 9 minutes and 20 seconds. After Hong Yulian studied several advantages of Yi Kuiyuan's cutting, he improved his operating method. It now only takes 4 minutes and 10 seconds to machine one part.

　　马恒昌小组
    五月份又实现挑战条件
    马恒昌小组五月份又实现了向全国工人提出的挑战条件。全组在五月份提前四天零六小时完成了全月生产任务；产品质量达到百分之九十九点七；改进工具一种，创造工具两种，缩短了五种工作的生产时间，出勤率达到百分之九十九点二。
    五月份东北机械工业局高速切削法推广队在他们厂里开办了训练班。该组佟俊山、依奎元、洪玉廉三人参加了学习，考试成绩都很好。依奎元在初步理论和初步操作两次考试中，都得满分。他们在组内传播了学习经验后，大家更进一步熟悉了苏联车床的保养和使用方法。如赵殿奎、吴景福用高速切削法车牙轮的工作效率，已提高了二倍到四倍。此外，他们还和技术员共同学习和讨论了郭瓦廖夫工作方法，并在实际工作中收到初步效果。如洪玉廉原来做某种活需十四分三十秒，但依奎元只需用九分二十秒。洪玉廉研究了依奎元切削中的几个优点后，改进了操作方法。车一个活只要四分十秒了。
