　　[News from this newspaper] The work of advance purchase of cotton in Shijiazhuang Special District and its suburbs began in early May. In one month, a total of 33 million jin of seed cotton was pre-purchased (all contracts were signed). According to incomplete statistics from nine cotton-producing counties and two suburban districts, a total of 12 million jin of grain was paid as deposit. In addition, cotton farmers signed orders according to their own needs, including: more than 8.3 million jin of grain, more than 17.78 million jin of coal, 4 million jin of various oil cakes (fertilizers), more than 1.188 million jin of edible salt, as well as cloth, kerosene and many other daily necessities.
　　[News from this newspaper] Shijiazhuang Special District and suburban districts are comprehensively carrying out cotton purchasing and storage work. The local Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company has collected more than 500,000 jin of ginned cotton in half a month. Unified joint purchases have been implemented in markets in various counties, and the disconnection between list prices and market prices has been completely eliminated. Through in-depth patriotic propaganda and education, all cotton farmers and cotton storage households generally recognize that selling and storing cotton is a glorious political task they should undertake, and a fervent patriotic cotton selling and storing movement has been launched. After Dongliangzhuang in Gaoyi County arranged the task of purchasing and storing cotton, female cadre Geng Lanfeng mobilized relatives and neighbors to contribute more than 800 jin of cotton. At a cadre meeting in Zhaozhuang, Luancheng, everyone voluntarily reported 614 jin of cotton. Party members, labor models, cadres, cooperative members and activists from ten villages in the Sixth District of the city suburbs held a cotton selling and storing competition rally on the 10th. Villages enthusiastically launched challenges and responses, guaranteeing not to leave a single piece of cotton, and to sell or store all the stored cotton to the state to defeat the American devils as soon as possible. At present, the collective cotton selling and storing movement in various villages is booming.
　　According to recent investigations and understanding of various counties and suburban districts, the masses still have abundant cotton in storage. For example, according to the materials of typical villages investigated in various districts of Shulu County, the county's cotton storage still accounts for 13.2% of last year's total output. Only in Guojiazhuang, the key point of investigation in the Second District, six households were investigated, and there were more than 80,000 jin of cotton in storage. The cadres are full of confidence and are continuing to carry out patriotic propaganda, striving to victoriously complete the cotton purchasing task.

　　石家庄专区和市郊区展开购棉工作        
    一个月预购籽棉三千余万斤        
    该地花纱布公司半月收进皮棉五十万斤
    【本报讯】石家庄专区和市郊区的预购棉花工作，从五月初开始，一个月来共预购了籽棉三千三百万斤（全部订了合同）。据产棉区九个县及市郊两个区的不完全统计，共付出定金粮食一千二百万斤。另外棉农们根据自己的需要签订定货单的计有：粮食八百三十多万斤，煤炭一千七百八十多万斤，各种油饼（肥料）四百万斤，食盐一百一十八万八千多斤，以及布匹、煤油等许多日用必需品。
    【本报讯】石家庄专区和市郊区全面进行购棉、储棉工作，花纱布公司半个月共收进皮棉五十多万斤。各县市场实行了统一联购，牌价和市价的脱节现象已完全消灭。通过深入开展爱国主义宣传教育，全体棉农及存棉户普遍认识到卖棉存棉是自己应当担负的光荣的政治任务，热烈掀起爱国售棉、存棉运动。高邑县东良庄布置购、储棉花任务后，妇女干部耿兰凤动员亲友和街坊共拿出棉花八百多斤。栾城赵庄在一次干部会上，大家自动报出棉花六百一十四斤。市郊六区十个村的党员、劳动模范、干部、合作社社员及积极分子在十号召开了卖棉、存棉竞赛大会，各村热烈展开挑战应战，保证不留一块棉花，把全部存棉卖给或存给国家，早日打败美国鬼子。现各村集体卖棉存棉运动正蓬勃开展。
    据对各县和市郊最近这一阶段的调查了解，群众的存棉还很丰富。如束鹿县根据各区调查典型村材料，全县存棉尚占去年总产量的百分之十三点二，其中只在二区郭家庄重点了解了六户，就有存棉八万多斤。干部们信心百倍，正在继续进行爱国主义宣传，为胜利完成购棉任务而奋斗。
