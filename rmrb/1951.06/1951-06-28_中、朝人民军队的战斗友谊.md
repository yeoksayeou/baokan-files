　　The Combat Friendship of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies
    In the May counter-offensive on the eastern front of the Zhaoyang River in Korea (referring to the second phase from the 16th to the 21st), the Chinese and Korean People's forces jointly achieved a new victory by annihilating over 17,000 enemy troops. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers converged like two pincers southeast of Linjie, encircling and routing the majority of four divisions of the Li puppet army. Every soldier in both forces was elated by the prospect of meeting in battle and advanced bravely and swiftly. When a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers advanced 120 li deep behind enemy lines in 13 hours and 10 minutes, cutting off the enemy's escape route south, the Korean People's Army, disregarding the fatigue of fighting all night, continued their forced march during the day, arriving in time at the destination to intercept the enemy's escape route east, and seized over 230 enemy trucks loaded with grain and ammunition and many artillery pieces. Finally, the two forces victoriously met in the Cangcun area southeast of Linjie. The Chinese and Korean commanders in the vanguard warmly shook hands. The commander of the People's Army also spoke on the phone with the superiors of the Volunteer Army, excitedly saying: "Let us cooperate more closely and victory will be in our hands!"
    After annihilating a part of the enemy, these two heroic forces launched a pursuit in the same direction. Staff officers of the People's Army, familiar with the terrain, drew up a route map, pointing out the easy routes and those that could avoid enemy fire to the Volunteer Army. During the pursuit, when the two forces were walking on the same road, the People's Army would give the middle of the road to the Volunteer Army, and walk to the side of the road themselves. The soldiers greeted each other while running, and comforted each other. A soldier of the People's Army reached out and shook hands with a soldier of the Volunteer Army, and said "Xin ku le (you've worked hard)" in broken Chinese. The Volunteer Army soldier wanted to hold him back and say a few words, but he had already moved forward with the team. The Volunteer Army soldier said from behind: "We are brotherly forces, fighting to make the people live a good life, so what's so hard about it?"
    Yes, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting heroically side by side for the independence and liberation of Korea, for the peace and security of China and Korea, and for the happiness of the people of the world. In the common struggle against the Japanese aggressors, there was a brotherly feeling between the Chinese and Korean people, and this precious combat friendship has been further consolidated and enhanced in the fight against the American aggressors.
    In battle, there is nothing more encouraging to the warriors of both countries than the words "the People's Army is with us" and "the Volunteers are in front of us". On the night of May 19, the Chinese and Korean People's forces arrived at the foot of the 1,000-meter-high Baolai Ridge at the same time. The enemy on the top of the mountain was sweeping down the mountain with dense fire. A platoon of the Volunteer Army was ordered to attack the enemy, and the soldiers climbed forward through the dense forest in the face of the enemy's dense fire. At this time, the machine gunners of the People's Army automatically provided fire support to the Volunteer Army. Twenty minutes later, the sound of grenades exploded on the top of the mountain, followed by the signal to occupy the position. The enemy was eliminated, and groups of prisoners were escorted down the mountain. The soldiers of the People's Army at the foot of the mountain applauded and cheered: "Volunteer Army *dongmu* (comrade) very good, very good!" The soldiers of the Volunteer Army also thanked the People's Army for their fire support.
    In another battle, the warriors of the Volunteer Army held a forward position until a battalion of the People's Army launched an attack from this position. The soldiers of the People's Army bravely and tenaciously defeated the enemy and occupied the hills on the left and right sides in front of the Volunteer Army's position. When the enemy counterattacked again under the cover of tanks and artillery fire, the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers quickly formed a three-sided crossfire network, causing the enemy's infantry and tanks to flee in panic, while the Chinese and Korean People's forces suffered no casualties. At this time, the soldiers of the People's Army waved to the soldiers of the Volunteer Army on the position with excitement, shouting in Chinese: "Comrade, you fought well!" The soldiers of the Volunteer Army also replied in broken Korean: "*Dongmu*, *dangsin chosoyo* (Comrade, how are you!)"
    A touching story is circulating among the Chinese and Korean People's forces who fought side by side on the Zhaoyang River front. The story goes like this: While chasing the enemy, three rocket launchers of the Volunteer Army, Luo Jiakui, Cai Dongmei, and Jin Yunshan, lost contact with their troops. These three soldiers immediately contacted the People's Army. They said to the battalion commander of the People's Army: "We have lost contact with our troops, but now is the time for fighting, so we have come to ask you to let us temporarily join the People's Army and continue fighting." The battalion commander of the People's Army warmly welcomed them, and immediately assigned them to a squad temporarily. These three Volunteer Army soldiers fought with the Korean People's Army for a day and two nights, and finally returned to their troops. When the battle was about to end victoriously, the squad leader of the People's Army was unfortunately wounded, and the soldiers of the Volunteer Army rushed to comfort him, and took out a first-aid kit to bandage his wound. This is the love of comrades-in-arms, this great and noble love made the squad leader of the People's Army shed tears.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are fighting together in this way, and will continue to fight side by side heroically in this way. Victory is in the hands of the closely united Chinese and Korean People's armies.

　　中、朝人民军队的战斗友谊
    新华社记者  巴力  耐因
    在朝鲜东部照阳江前线的五月反击战中（按指十六日至二十一日的第二阶段），中、朝人民部队又共同创造了歼敌一万七千多人的新胜利。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军像两把钳子似的在麟蹄东南合拢，包围和击溃了李伪军四个师的大部。两支部队里的每个战士，都为战斗中的预期的会师而欢欣鼓舞，勇猛疾进。当中国人民志愿军某部以十三小时又十分钟时间，深入敌后一百二十里，斩断敌军往南的逃路时，朝鲜人民军也不顾通夜战斗的疲劳，在白昼继续强行军，及时赶到目的地，截住敌军的东逃去路，并缴获了敌人二百三十多辆满载粮食弹药的卡车和许多大炮。最后，两支部队在麟蹄东南的苍村地区胜利会师了。先头部队中的中、朝指挥员们在见面时热烈地紧紧地握手。人民军的指挥员又从电话里和志愿军的上级首长通了话，他兴奋地说：“让我们更加亲密地协同作战，胜利就掌握在我们手里！”
    这两支英雄部队在歼灭了一部敌军之后，又朝着一个方向展开了追击。熟悉地形的人民军参谋人员绘制了前进的路线图，把易于通过和能够避开敌人火力封锁的道路指点给志愿军部队。在追击途中，两支部队走在一条路上的时候，人民军就把路的中间让给志愿军，自己走到路边上去。战士们一边跑步前进，一边打着招呼，互相慰问。人民军的一个战士伸过手来和一个志愿军的战士握握手，又用生硬的中国话说了声“辛苦了”。志愿军战士想拉住他说几句话，他却已经跟着队伍前进了。志愿军战士在后面说：“我们是兄弟部队，都是为了让人民过好日子在打仗，谈得到什么辛苦呢？”
    是的，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军正在为着朝鲜的独立解放、为着中朝两国的和平安全和世界人民的幸福而英勇地并肩战斗着。在对日本侵略者的共同斗争中，中、朝人民间有兄弟般的感情，而这种珍贵的战斗友谊，在反对美国侵略者的战斗中又更加巩固和增进了。
    在战斗中再没有比“人民军和我们在一起”、“志愿军在我们前面”这样的话更能鼓舞两国勇士们的了。在五月十九日夜间，中、朝人民部队同时赶到了一千公尺高的宝来岭下。山顶的敌人正以密集的火力向山下扫射。志愿军的一个排奉命攻击敌人，战士们冒着敌人的密集火力在密林中攀登前进。这时人民军的机枪射手们便自动以火力支援志愿军。二十分钟以后，山头上就响起了手榴弹的爆炸声，接着升起了占领阵地的信号。敌人被解决了，成群的俘虏被押下山来。在山下的人民军战士都鼓掌欢呼：“志愿军冬木（同志）顶好顶好！”志愿军的战士们也纷纷感谢人民军的火力支援。
    在另一次战斗里，志愿军的勇士们坚守着一处前沿阵地，直到人民军的一个大队从这个阵地出击。人民军的战士们勇猛顽强地打垮了敌人，占领了志愿军阵地前面左右两侧的山头。当敌人在坦克和炮火掩护下再行反扑的时候，中、朝人民战士迅速组成了三面交叉的火力网，打得敌人的步兵和坦克落荒而逃，而中、朝人民部队则无一伤亡。这时人民军的战士在阵地上兴奋得向志愿军战士招手，用中国话高喊着：“同志，你们打得好呀！”志愿军的战士也用不纯熟的朝鲜话答道：“冬木，当信朝扫（同志，你们好）！”
    曾在照阳江前线并肩作战的中、朝人民部队里，现在流传着一个动人的故事。故事是这样的：在追击敌人的时候，志愿军的三个火箭筒手罗家奎、蔡冬梅、金云山和自己的部队失掉了联络。这三个战士马上去和人民军取得联系。他们对人民军的大队长说：“我们和部队失掉了联络，但现在正是打仗的时候，我们特来请求你让我们暂时参加人民军继续战斗。”人民军的大队长热烈地欢迎他们，并马上把他们暂时分配到一个分队里去。这三个志愿军战士就和朝鲜人民军在一起打了一天两夜的仗，最后回到自己的部队。在战斗将要胜利结束的时候，人民军的分队长不幸负了伤，志愿军的战士急忙跑过去慰问他，并且拿出急救包替他包扎伤口。这是战友的爱，这伟大崇高的爱使人民军的分队长掉下了热泪。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军就是这样地战斗在一起，并将继续这样并肩英勇战斗。胜利就掌握在这样亲密团结的中、朝人民军队手里。
