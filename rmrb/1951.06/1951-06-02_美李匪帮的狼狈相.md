　　The Embarrassing Plight of the American and Syngman Rhee Gangs

According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on May 22nd, the American battleship "New Jersey" and destroyer "Brinkley Bass," which had been indiscriminately bombarding peaceful towns and villages on the east coast of Korea, were "hit by coastal artillery" of the Korean and Chinese People's Army "in the waters near Wonsan," causing numerous casualties. The "New Jersey" is the flagship of the US Seventh Fleet commander, Martin, who is invading Korea and our Taiwan.

Syngman Rhee's puppet army's Chief of Staff, Chang Yi-kwon, admitted on May 22nd that his troops had suffered heavy losses under the blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Army and were difficult to replenish, thus "reducing combat effectiveness and using inexperienced officers in high-ranking positions."

According to the Associated Press, "the body of Major General Kim Baek-il, commander of the First Corps of the South Korean Army," was "discovered on Hwangranbong Mountain southwest of Gangneung." According to the Associated Press, Kim Baek-il flew back to his base after meeting with Ridgway at the end of March, and has been "missing" since then.

The economic situation of the tottering Syngman Rhee puppet regime is very serious, with prices having risen by 500 percent compared to before June of last year. The Syngman Rhee puppet government has requested the US government to return 132 million yuan in counterfeit currency "loaned" to the US troops invading Korea in order to "cope with the current economic crisis." People in the Syngman Rhee puppet government said that "about 40 percent" of the total amount of counterfeit currency "issued in the past eight months" was "loaned" to the US troops invading Korea.

　　美李匪帮的狼狈相
    据合众社华盛顿五月二十二日电透露：对朝鲜东海岸和平城乡滥肆轰击的美国战斗舰“新泽西”号和驱逐舰“布林克雷·巴士”号，“在元山附近海面上”，被朝、中人民军队的“海岸大炮击中”，死伤多名。“新泽西”号是侵略朝鲜和我国台湾的美国第七舰队司令马丁的旗舰。
    李承晚伪军总参谋长张义宽五月二十二日承认：在朝中人民军队打击下，他的军队损失惨重，难于补充，因此，“使作战效率降低，并用缺乏经验的军官担任高级的职务。”
    据美联社透露：“南朝鲜第一兵团司令官金朴义少将的尸体”，已“在江陵西南的黄兰邦山上被发现。”据美联社说，金朴义在三月底和李奇微开会后，乘飞机飞返他的基地，此后即“下落不明”。
    风雨飘摇的李承晚傀儡政权的经济情况甚为严重，物价已较去年六月前上涨了百分之五百。李承晚傀儡政府已要求美国政府归还“借给”侵朝美军的一亿三千二百万元伪币，以“应付目前的经济危机”。李承晚傀儡政府人士说：“过去八个月中所发行的”伪币总数中，“约有百分之四十”是“借给”侵朝美军的。
