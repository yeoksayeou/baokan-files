    西藏三代表行前曾捐款并表示将发动西藏人民捐献武器
    【新华社十四日讯】中央人民政府赴西藏代表张经武及西藏地方政府全权代表凯墨·索安旺堆、土丹旦达、桑颇·登增顿珠，以及随行工作人员等一行二十余人，于十三日下午六时四十五分乘车离开北京，将经香港、印度等地到达西藏。前赴车站欢送者有中央人民政府副主席李济深、政务院副总理董必武、陈云、黄炎培、政务院秘书长兼民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉及中央人民政府各有关部门首长、北京市人民政府副市长吴晗、班禅驻北京办事处处长计晋美等十余人，另有中央民族学院、蒙藏学校的学生四百多人。
    凯墨等三位代表于离京前，曾留交中央民族事务委员会刘格平副主任委员人民币一百万元，请他转给抗美援朝总会，作为捐献飞机大炮的用款。另附信一封，信里说：我们看到祖国人民取得了抗美援朝的伟大胜利，非常高兴。我们因为带的钱不多，谨捐出人民币一百万元，作为购买飞机大炮的用款，我们回去以后，将发动西藏人民展开捐献运动，来支援我国志愿军和朝鲜人民军取得更大的胜利。
