Editor's Note: This notice issued by the Xinxiang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Pingyuan Province should be studied by all party cadres, especially those engaged in economic work. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has forwarded this notice to party committees at all levels in North China, requiring them to pay universal attention to it. We believe that opposing the tendency to neglect ideological and political work is indeed an extremely important issue at present, and all party cadres should pay attention to this issue in their daily leadership work. The notice points out that the expanded cadre meeting in Qinyang County tested everyone's understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the results showed that cadres of higher-level organs were not as knowledgeable as district cadres, and district cadres were not as knowledgeable as village cadres and activists, with cadres engaged in economic work having the worst understanding. This shows that the tendency of some of our leading organs and some cadres to only focus on professional work, not ask about politics, and not study Marxism-Leninism has become quite serious. This is a manifestation of the petty and vulgar bourgeois style infiltrating some of our comrades. The main reason why this narrow and vulgar bourgeois style has grown in some links within the party is that some leading organs and leading cadres only conduct professional leadership in a simple manner, while relaxing ideological and political leadership and relaxing the cause of educating our cadres with Marxism-Leninism. This tendency will greatly harm our revolutionary cause and the future of these comrades who do not ask about politics. The entire party should firmly remember Comrade Stalin's profound saying about the Communist Party's need to strengthen ideological and political work within the party, thereby valuing and strengthening ideological and political work within the party. Comrade Stalin said: "If our party's propaganda work limps for some reason, if the cause of educating our cadres with Marxism-Leninism weakens, if the work of raising the political and theoretical level of these cadres weakens, and these cadres themselves no longer care about the future of our progress, no longer understand the correctness of our cause, and become bureaucratic functionaries who blindly and mechanically execute the instructions of their superiors without any future prospects, then all of our national and party work will definitely weaken. In any department of national and party work, the higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, and the more the staff themselves will become short-sighted people, degenerating into bureaucratic functionaries who only seek immediate interests, and the more easily they will degenerate and change their nature - this can be regarded as a theorem." (Summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) at the Eighteenth Party Congress)

Communists should pay attention to politics. Political issues should be the most important issues that every communist and all revolutionary workers should pay attention to. The Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party clearly stipulates that "actively participating in the political life of the party and the revolutionary movement in the country" is one of the obligations of a party member. Comrade Stalin said: "A Leninist cannot merely be an expert in the science he loves, he must also be a politician and social activist, actively concerned about the fate of his country, understand the laws of social development, be good at applying these laws, and strive to become an active participant in the country's political leadership." (Summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) at the Eighteenth Party Congress)

Politics is the concentrated expression of economics, which means that all our specific economic work serves the overall political tasks. Today's international and domestic political struggles are so sharp that we must win in the political struggle (including armed struggle against imperialism and its running dogs) in order to guarantee the construction of the country and the happiness of the people; otherwise, we will not only be unable to further build our country, but also unable to consolidate the victories we have already won. Therefore, every communist and every revolutionary cadre, regardless of what work they are engaged in, should stand at their posts, give full play to their high degree of enthusiasm, and strive for the great and clear goals of political struggle, so that all kinds of practical work are combined with the long-term and current great goals of political struggle.

At present, the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries has been launched universally, deeply, and vigorously in our region. Especially since March, in accordance with the spirit of the "Regulations on Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," we have arrested and executed a number of counter-revolutionaries, which has greatly boosted the morale of the broad masses of people in the region, stabilized social order, and greatly promoted all kinds of practical work, and the entire region has been given a new look. The serious tendency of closing the door to production and not asking about politics has been overcome to a large extent. At present, we have begun to closely combine production and construction and other tasks with the current political struggle, which has given new impetus to all tasks, and at the same time, through various specific tasks, we have deepened and consolidated the current political struggle - the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries.

However, we still have serious shortcomings in this regard. The tendency of only managing professional work and not asking about politics, or only valuing professional work and neglecting politics, closing the door to construction and not caring about resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, burying oneself in production and not caring about the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, etc., still exists in individual departments and among a few cadres. For example, the agricultural assistant in the first district of Meng County, in the village convened ten mass meetings, eight times did not mention current affairs, and he also said: "Publicizing resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is adding trouble and wasting time." Comrade Shi Xiuzhen, a cadre of the cooperative in the sixth district of Bo'ai County, when inspecting work in Huayuan Village in April, just arrived at the entrance of the village and happened to meet a woman on duty at the village's "literacy post," pointing to the four characters "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea" written on the blackboard and saying to her: "Do you know what these words are? Explain them." But Comrade Shi Xiuzhen not only did not recognize or explain them, but instead said to the woman: "I am a cadre of the cooperative and I don't care about the work of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea." Comrade Guo Caifu of the Research Office of the Workers' Committee of Chengguan District, Ji County, once went to an iron factory, and the workers said: "The cadres of the police station of the Public Security Bureau know everything, who is good and who is bad, they know the activities of bad people." Comrade Guo said: "That is the business of the Public Security Bureau and the police station, we don't care about that." But the workers immediately criticized him unceremoniously: "Everyone is responsible for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, why don't you care?" Comrade Guo was speechless. The district heads of the first and fifth districts of Meng County also reviewed at this enlarged cadre meeting: "We used to think that resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries was the business of the party committee, and the government was mainly engaged in production, so in our work, we did not combine production with resisting US aggression and aiding Korea." At the enlarged cadre meeting in Qinyang County, a test was conducted on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The average score for village cadres and activists was 82, the average score for district cadres was 53, and the average score for organ cadres was 49. The economic organs were the worst, such as the cadres of the Salt Industry Company who only answered one sentence correctly out of ten questions. This situation shows that many organ cadres do not understand the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries as well as the masses. More seriously, some comrades not only do not care about the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, but also stand aside and hold a skeptical attitude towards the policies of the party and the government. For example, Comrade Qian Tang, the head of the Cultural and Educational Section of Ji County, as a communist and engaged in education work, recently opposed vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries when the Cultural and Educational Section of the Commissioner's Office discussed the training of teachers, and even said things like "it is best to educate and reform" and "do not cause a shock." The above examples are enough to arouse our serious vigilance. In addition, such as some rural cadres who only focus on the individual economic interests of farmers when publicizing production to farmers, simply emphasizing getting rich, and do not strive to improve the political consciousness of farmers and educate farmers to connect production with politics, individuals with the motherland; some factory cadres who only pay attention to production figures and ignore political education in their work with workers; some schools that only pay attention to cultural learning and abandon political learning; individual systems and units that only pay attention to engaging in professional work in isolation and ignore combining with politics; there are still many such phenomena. All these impermissible erroneous tendencies of neglecting politics or failing to closely combine professional work with politics should be quickly and thoroughly corrected.

It is not a bad thing but a good thing for communists to value their professional work, and it should be promoted and not opposed. But our professional work is all subordinate to the purpose of politics. If we forget politics because we are buried in professional work, then that is wrong and should be opposed. In order to truly and effectively change the situation of neglecting politics among some comrades, so that similar phenomena will no longer occur in the future, and so that the entire party and all the people can be mobilized under the call of a certain political goal for a certain period of time to strive for the victory of various struggles, we require: (1) All party groups and party members of all levels, systems, units, and departments should pay attention to political study, that is, the study of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and the study of current affairs policies, and should conduct a check recently to check whether there are erroneous tendencies in their own units and themselves of only managing professional work and not asking about politics, not studying politics, and not reading books and newspapers, and whether there are phenomena of only valuing professional work and neglecting politics or making the two oppose each other. If so, we should propose ways to overcome them. (2) At present, all systems, units, and departments should regard popularizing and deepening patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea and eliminate counter-revolutionaries among the masses as one of their regular tasks, formulate work plans, repeatedly check and implement them, so that the comrades' thinking is politicized, and a strong political atmosphere is cultivated among the comrades. Experience has proven that assigning cadres to serve as reporters or propagandists, assigning propaganda targets, and checking propaganda results are one of the most effective ways to promote cadres to seriously study politics. (3) When leading organs arrange various work tasks, and when checking work and understanding the situation, they should be closely and regularly combined with the current basic political struggle, and overcome the tendency to conduct them in isolation and not in combination. It is necessary to ensure that patriotic ideological education for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and eliminating counter-revolutionary activities becomes the driving force for all work, and that the ideological education of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea is deepened and consolidated through various practical work, and that the ideological and political level of our cadres is greatly improved. Otherwise, it will make the ideological level of our cadres lag behind the political situation and the demands of the masses, which is very dangerous.

### 反对不问政治的倾向  （中国共产党平原省新乡地方委员会一九五一年五月通报）

　　反对不问政治的倾向
    （中国共产党平原省新乡地方委员会一九五一年五月通报）
    编者按：平原省新乡地委所发的这个通报，全党干部特别是经济工作干部都应当加以研究。中共中央华北局已将此项通报转发华北各级党委，要求他们普遍地加以注意。我们认为，反对忽视思想政治工作的倾向，确是目前一个极其重要的问题，全党干部在自己的日常领导工作中都应当注意这一个问题。通报中指出：沁阳县扩大干部会议测验了大家对镇压反革命的认识，结果是上级机关干部不如区干部，区干部又不如村干部及积极分子，其中经济工作干部的认识最差。这说明我们有些领导机关和有些干部只钻业务，不问政治，不学习马克思列宁主义的倾向，已相当严重。这是资产阶级的狭隘庸俗作风侵入了我们有些同志身上的表现。某些领导机关和领导干部只单纯地进行业务领导，而放松思想政治领导，放松用马克思列宁主义来教育我们的干部的事业，就是这种狭隘的、庸俗的资产阶级作风在党内某些环节滋长起来的主要原因。这种倾向会极大地危害我们的革命事业，并危害这些不问政治的同志们的前途。全党都应当牢记斯大林同志关于共产党必须加强党内思想政治工作的下述至理名言，从而重视和加强党内思想政治工作。斯大林同志说：“如果我们党的宣传工作因某种缘故而跛起脚来，如果用马克思列宁主义教育我们干部的事业衰弱下去，如果我们提高这些干部的政治和理论水准的工作削弱下去，而这些干部本身又因此而不复关心我们向前进展的前途，不复了解我们事业的正确性，而变成一些茫无前途，盲目式和机械式执行上级指示的事务主义者，那么我们全部国家的和党的工作，也就一定会衰弱下去。在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员的政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作的结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员的政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈容易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理。”（在联共（布）十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）
    共产党员应该注意政治。政治问题，应该是每一个共产党员和一切革命工作者所要注意的头等重大问题。中国共产党党章明确地规定了：“积极参加党内的政治生活和国内的革命运动”，是党员的义务之一。斯大林同志说过：“列宁主义者决不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的那门科学的专家，他同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家，积极关怀本国命运，通晓社会发展规律，善于运用这些规律，并力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。”（在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）
    政治是经济的集中表现，这就是说，我们的一切具体经济工作，都是为着总的政治任务服务的。今天国际国内的政治斗争是如此地尖锐，我们必须在政治斗争（包括反对帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争）上得到胜利，国家的建设和人民的幸福才能得到保障；否则，我们不但不可能进一步地建设我们的国家，就是已得的胜利也是不能巩固的。因此，每一个共产党员和每一个革命干部，不论从事何项工作，都应站在自己的岗位上，发挥自己的高度积极性，为伟大的明确的政治斗争目标而奋斗，使各种实际工作都和长远的和当前的伟大的政治斗争目标结合起来。
    目前，抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动已在我区普遍深入地、轰轰烈烈地开展起来，特别从三月份以来，我们根据“惩治反革命条例”的精神，逮捕和处决了一批反革命分子，全区广大人民因此扬眉吐气，社会秩序因此得到稳定，各种实际工作也因此大大推进了一步，全区的面貌为之一新。关门生产，不问政治的严重倾向，已经在很大程度上克服了。目前我们已开始使生产建设等各项工作紧密地与当前政治斗争相结合，这样就使得各项工作得到了新的动力，同时又通过各项具体工作深入和巩固了目前的政治斗争——抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动。
    但是，目前我们在这方面还存在着严重的缺点。只管业务而不问政治，或只重视业务而轻视政治，关门建设不管抗美援朝，埋头生产不管镇压反革命工作等倾向，在个别部门和少数干部中依然存在。例如，孟县第一区农业助理员，在村里召开了十次群众大会有八次不提时事，他并且说：“宣传抗美援朝是多加麻烦，浪费时间。”博爱县第六区合作社干部史秀珍同志，四月份到花园村检查工作时，刚到村口，正碰上该村“识字岗哨”站岗的妇女，手指着黑板上写的“抗美援朝”四字向她说：“你认识这是什么字吗？给讲一讲。”但史秀珍同志不仅没认没讲，反而对那个妇女说：“我是合作社的干部，不管抗美援朝的工作。”汲县城关区工委会研究室郭才富同志，一次到了一个铁工厂，工人说：“公安局派出所干部啥也知道，谁好谁坏，坏人活动他都清楚。”郭同志说：“那是公安局和派出所的事，我们不管那事。”但工人同志马上就不客气地批评他说：“抗美援朝，镇压反革命，人人有责，你为啥不管？”郭同志无言可答。孟县第一、五区区长在这次扩大干部会上亦检讨说：“我们以前只认为抗美援朝、镇压反革命是党委的事，政府主要是搞生产，因此，在工作中就没把生产和抗美援朝结合起来。”沁阳全县扩大干部会上测验了一下镇压反革命问题，村干部、积极分子每人平均八十二分，区干部每人平均五十三分，机关干部每人平均四十九分；以经济机关最差，如盐业公司干部测验十题，只答对了一句。这个情况，说明许多机关干部对镇压反革命问题的认识还不如群众。更严重的是有些同志对镇压反革命的斗争不仅漠不关心，还站在一边对党和政府的政策持怀疑态度。如汲县文教科长钱塘同志，身为共产党员，又作教育工作，最近在专署文教科讨论集训教员时，他对镇压反革命竟然反对大张旗鼓，还说什么“最好是教育改造”“不要震动”等类的话。上述诸例，已经足够引起我们的严重警惕。此外，如某些农村干部对农民宣传生产只注重农民个人的经济利益，单纯地强调发家致富，而不努力提高农民的政治觉悟，教育农民把生产和政治、个人和祖国联系起来；某些工厂干部在工人工作中只注意生产数字，而忽视政治教育；某些学校只注意文化学习而放弃政治学习，个别系统和单位只注意孤立地搞业务而忽视与政治结合；这类现象，还有不少。所有这些忽视政治，或未将业务与政治紧密结合的不能容许的错误倾向，应该迅速而彻底地加以纠正。
    共产党员重视自己的业务，这不是坏事而是好事，应当提倡而不应当反对。但是我们的业务都是服从于政治的目的的，如果因为埋头业务而忘记了政治，那就是不对的，应当反对的了。为了真正有效地转变一部分同志中忽视政治的情况，使今后不再有类似现象发生，使全党和全体人民在一定时期在一定政治目标的号召下动员起来，争取各种斗争的胜利，我们要求：（一）所有各级各系统各单位各部门的党组和党员同志，都应当注意政治的学习，即马克思列宁主义的基本理论的学习和时事政策的学习，并且应当在最近作一次检查，检查一下本单位和自己有没有只管业务而不问政治的、不学习政治、不看书不读报的错误倾向，有没有只重视业务而忽视政治或使两者对立起来的现象。如有，就应当提出克服的办法。（二）各系统各单位各部门，目前应把在群众中普及深入抗美爱国和消灭反革命的政治教育视为自己的经常任务之一，订出工作计划，反复检查贯彻，使同志们的思想政治化，在同志们中间养成浓厚的政治空气。经验证明，指定干部担任报告员或宣传员，分配宣传对象并检查宣传结果，是推动干部认真学习政治的最有效方法之一。（三）领导机关在布置各项工作任务时，在检查工作和了解情况时，都要紧密地经常地与当前的基本政治斗争结合起来，克服孤立进行而不相结合的偏向。必须做到使抗美援朝、消灭反革命活动的爱国主义思想教育成为一切工作的推动力，而又通过各种实际工作来深入和巩固抗美援朝爱国主义的思想教育，将我们干部的思想政治水平大大提高一步。不如此，便会使我们干部的思想水平落后于政治形势和群众要求，那是很危险的。
