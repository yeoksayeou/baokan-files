Representatives from the to-be-liberated areas, thousands of miles away, also sent representatives to participate in the meeting. In the past six months, under the leadership of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, the people in the area have created brilliant achievements in support work. Heroic Tibetan compatriots crossed snow-capped mountains over 5,000 meters above sea level in the season when the mountains were covered in snow and actively transported materials in the freezing weather, ensuring the supply of materials for the troops marching into Tibet. The representatives who attended the meeting were all moved by the heroic deeds of the Tibetan people in supporting the People's Liberation Army and unanimously agreed that supporting the People's Liberation Army in entering the motherland's border areas was a practical action to defend the motherland and defend world peace.

Representatives from the grassland pastoral areas decided to prepare a large amount of dry firewood and cow dung to solve the problem of firewood shortage for the troops during the march. Each representative attending the meeting signed the resolution passed by the conference to express their determination to support. At the end of the meeting, the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee and the General Assembly of the People's Support Committee jointly held a grand award ceremony, and five model dzong and eleven support models were honorably awarded banners.
