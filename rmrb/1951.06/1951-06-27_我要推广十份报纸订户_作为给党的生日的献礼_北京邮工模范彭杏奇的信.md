　　I want to promote ten newspaper subscriptions as a gift to the Party's birthday
    ——Letter from Peng Xingqi, a model postal worker in Beijing

Respected Chairman Mao:

    The great 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching, and I am very excited.

    The Party has cultivated and educated me, enabling me to improve politically and culturally. Especially in the past year, I have worked actively and achieved results in delivering letters and distributing newspapers and periodicals, and I was selected as a model worker. Today, I have been promoted to leadership work, enabling me to serve the people even more. I feel it is the utmost honor. This is the result of the Party's education and help.

    Currently, all employees of our bureau are launching a patriotic production increase and donation campaign to donate aircraft and artillery by increasing production and overfulfilling production tasks, in order to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. All employees of the bureau have signed a patriotic convention, launched a patriotic production competition, improved work efficiency, and launched a hundred-day error-free campaign to ensure smooth mail delivery regardless of wind or rain. I have personally established a patriotic production increase and donation plan to expand the distribution of books and newspapers; in addition to consolidating the existing base, I will increase the number of newspapers by sixty and books and periodicals by one hundred and twenty by the end of the year, and ensure error-free delivery. At the same time, I will actively participate in trade union work to promote the patriotic production competition campaign. To welcome July 1st, I will expand newspaper subscriptions by ten as a gift.

    I wish Chairman Mao good health.

    Peng Xingqi
    Beijing Dongsipailou Branch, China People's Postal Service

　　我要推广十份报纸订户  作为给党的生日的献礼
    ——北京邮工模范彭杏奇的信敬爱的毛主席：
    伟大的党的三十周年纪念日快到来了，我非常兴奋。
    党培养、教育了我，使我在政治上文化上提高了。特别是在去年一年来，我积极工作，在投递信函上和发行报刊上得到了成绩，被选为模范。今天又提拔了我作领导工作，使我更多地为人民服务。我觉得是无上的光荣。这是党的教育帮助的结果。
    现在我局全体职工正展开爱国增产捐献运动，以增加生产超额完成生产任务来捐献飞机大炮，支援中国人民志愿军。全局职工订立了爱国公约，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，提高工作效率，开展百日无错运动，保证风雨无阻，邮件畅通。我个人已订立了爱国增产捐献计划，扩大发行书报；除巩固基数外，到年终要增加六十份报纸、一二○份书刊，并保证投递无差错。同时积极参加工会工作，推动爱国主义生产竞赛运动。为迎接七一，我要扩大报纸订户十个，来作献礼。祝毛主席身体健康
