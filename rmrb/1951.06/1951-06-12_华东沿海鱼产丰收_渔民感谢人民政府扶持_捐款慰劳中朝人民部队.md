The current period marks the peak fishing season, and with the active support of local people's governments, fishermen in East China are experiencing harvests not seen in many years.

East China is the region with the highest fish production in the country. In the Zhoushan fishing grounds, famous for yellow croaker, production has already reached 7,000 tons of small yellow croaker and over 12,000 tons of large yellow croaker. It is currently the peak season for large yellow croaker. Since mid-May, whenever the weather is clear, large schools of yellow croaker have been seen floating on the surface. The coastal fishing grounds of Shandong Province have seen a particularly large catch of prawns this year. In the Yantai, Penglai, and Changshan Island areas, a total of 11 million jin of fish and shrimp were produced in March and April. In Penglai County's Liujiawang fishing port, the output of large prawns alone reached 1.49 million jin in the one and a half months from early March to mid-April, while the entire island's production last year was only 330,000 jin. In the past, the state-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company used hand-operated trawl fishing vessels, and each voyage rarely yielded more than 2,000 boxes of fish. This year, most voyages have exceeded 2,000 boxes, with the highest catch reaching over 4,100 boxes.

In order to support fishermen's production, people's governments at all levels in East China allocated all of the fishery loans from the Central People's Government in batches to fishermen as early as February. At the same time, in order to take care of the fishermen's economic capacity, the Financial and Economic Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee also approved a two-month tax deferral for organized fishermen when purchasing and storing fishery salt (for aquatic product processing). With such strong support from the People's Government, East China fishermen had already repaired their fishing boats and nets before the arrival of the spring fishing season. Some areas also added a large number of new fishing boats and nets. For example, in the coastal fishing villages of Laiyang, Wendeng, and four other special districts in Shandong Province, 535 new fishing boats and more than 30,000 new fishing nets were added this year.

After the abundant fish harvest, the transportation and sales of fish products became a major issue. This spring, aquatic product authorities in East China strengthened the work of transporting and selling fish products and managing fish markets. State-owned aquatic product enterprises have also widely signed entrusted processing and purchase contracts with cooperatives in various regions. In order to reduce the cost of fish products, the Ministry of Railways specially decided to reduce the freight rate for fresh fish by 50% from early April to the end of October, and the freight rate for salted fish by 30% from early May to the end of October. Zhejiang, Fujian, Southern Jiangsu and other provinces and regions have also added multiple fish markets in Wuxi, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Xiamen, and other places. These measures have increased the sales of fish products, and the price of fish has consistently maintained a reasonable ratio of one jin of fish to one jin of grain, so that the fishermen's lives will not be affected by low fish prices due to oversupply.

The fishermen who have achieved bumper harvests are grateful for the support of the People's Government and the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Recently, they have been writing letters to Chairman Mao to report on their production situation. In addition to writing letters, the fishermen of Yushi and Miaodao townships on Changshan Island, Shandong, also selected 2,320 pairs of large prawns to offer to Chairman Mao, and donated 4 million RMB to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting on the Korean front.

### 华东沿海鱼产丰收  渔民感谢人民政府扶持  捐款慰劳中朝人民部队

　　华东沿海鱼产丰收
　  渔民感谢人民政府扶持
    捐款慰劳中朝人民部队
    目前正是产鱼旺季，华东渔民在当地人民政府的积极扶持下，今年得到了多年未有的丰收。
    华东是全国产鱼最多的区域。盛产黄鱼的舟山渔场，到现在止，已产小黄鱼七千吨，大黄鱼一万两千吨以上。现在正是大黄鱼汛期，从五月中旬以来，每遇晴天，就有大群大黄鱼浮水逐流而过。山东沿海的渔场，今年产对虾特别多。烟台、蓬莱、长山岛一带的渔港，三、四两月内共产鱼、虾一千一百万斤。蓬莱县的刘家旺渔港从三月初到四月中旬的一个半月内，仅大对虾产量就有一百四十九万斤，而该岛去年全年所产不过三十三万斤。国营上海水产公司过去用手操网渔轮航海捕鱼，每次所获很少达到二千箱鱼，今年大部分均超过了二千箱，最多时曾捕到四千一百多箱。
    华东各地人民政府为扶持渔民生产，在今年二月即提前将中央人民政府所拨下的全部渔业贷款分批贷给渔民，同时为照顾渔民的经济能力，华东军政委员会财政经济委员会又批准有组织的渔民购储渔盐（作水产加工用）时，可记税两个月。华东渔民在人民政府这样大力扶持下，早在春季鱼汛到来前，即已修好了渔船、渔网，有的地区还新添了大批的新渔船和网具。如山东省的莱阳、文登等六个专区的沿海渔村，今年新添的渔船就有五百三十五条，新添的渔网有三万多个。
    鱼产丰收以后，鱼货的运销问题是大问题。今春华东各地水产机关都加强了鱼货运销和鱼市场管理的工作。各国营水产企业部门并普遍与各地合作社订立委托加工收购合同。中央铁道部为了降低鱼货的成本，特决定从四月初到十月底减低鲜鱼运价五成，从五月初到十月底减低咸鱼运价三成。浙江、福建、苏南等省、区并在无锡、温州、舟山、厦门等地增设鱼市场多处。这些措施都使得鱼货的销量加大，鱼价也始终保持了一斤鱼一斤粮的合理比价，渔民生活不致因鱼多价贱而受影响。
    得到丰收的渔民，他们感谢人民政府的扶持，感谢毛主席的英明领导，最近纷纷写信给毛主席报告他们的生产情形。山东长山岛的玉石、庙岛两乡的渔民除写信外，还拣了两千三百二十对大对虾献给毛主席，并以四百万元人民币慰劳在朝鲜前线作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。（新华社）
