In July 1928, the Sixth National Congress of the Party, while criticizing Chen Duxiu's capitulationism, also criticized the errors of "Left" adventurism. The Sixth Congress determined that the nature of the Chinese revolution remained democratic, with the overall task being to establish a workers' and peasants' democratic dictatorship against imperialism and feudalism, and it also stipulated the various programs for the workers' and peasants' democratic dictatorship. The Congress proposed the tasks of establishing the Red Army, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, and carrying out land distribution. The Congress pointed out that a revolutionary upsurge was inevitable, but also pointed out that the political situation at the time was between two revolutionary upsurges, pointing out the uneven development of the revolution, and pointing out that the Party's task at the time was not to attack, not to organize uprisings, but to win over the masses. These were the achievements of the Sixth Congress. The shortcomings of the Sixth Congress were its lack of correct assessment of the long-term nature of the democratic revolution, the role of the intermediate classes, and the internal contradictions within the reactionary forces; and its lack of necessary understanding of the strategic retreats needed in the Party's strategy, especially the need to shift the focus of the Party's work from cities where the enemy's strength was relatively strong to rural areas where the enemy's strength was relatively weak. The leadership of the Party remained in the hands of "Left" elements. The shortcomings of the Sixth Congress hindered the thorough rectification of "Left" errors within the Party.

Comrade Mao Zedong did not attend the Sixth Congress of the Party. At the Sixth Congress, Comrade Mao Zedong was elected as a member of the Party's Central Committee.

The problems that the Sixth Congress did not correctly solve were subsequently resolved by Comrade Mao Zedong in both practice and theory. In October 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong led a newly formed workers' and peasants' revolutionary army to retreat to the border area between Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, where he established the Hunan-Jiangxi Revolutionary Government and began to lead the peasants in distributing land. Later, Comrades Zhu De, Chen Yi, and Lin Biao led a detachment from the Nanchang Uprising in Guangdong, passing through Jiangxi and entering southern Hunan, where they led local peasants in revolutionary guerrilla warfare, expanded their forces, and in April 1928, merged with the forces in the Jinggang Mountains to form the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Fourth Army. In the struggle against the enemy, they fought many victorious battles. After the forces led by Comrade Peng Dehuai from the Pingjiang Uprising joined, the revolutionary base area with the Jinggang Mountains as its center gradually expanded and consolidated. During this period, the peasant guerrilla warfare and land struggles led by the Party in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and other places also developed, and several Red Army units and revolutionary base areas were successively established. In 1929, Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De led the Red Army to advance to southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, and established the Central Revolutionary Base Area with Ruijin, Jiangxi, as its center.

The revolutionary base areas and revolutionary wars led by Comrade Mao Zedong since the winter of 1927, as well as the revolutionary base areas and revolutionary wars led by other comrades in other regions, became the main content of the new period of the Chinese revolution, a major force in the national political life, and the greatest threat to Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary rule and the greatest hope of the laboring people of the whole country.

Why were the Red Army wars and rural revolutionary base areas possible? Why did they become the main content of the Chinese revolutionary struggle at that time? Comrade Mao Zedong provided theoretical answers in two articles: "Why Can the Red Political Power Exist in China?" written in October 1928, and "The Spark Will Start a Prairie Fire," written in January 1930. In the first article, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: the main conditions for the existence of the Red political power at that time were five: first, the characteristics of China, that is, the local agricultural economy and the exploitative policies of the imperialist powers, which created gaps in the reactionary rule, providing opportunities for revolutionary forces; second, the legacy of the First Civil War; third, the continued advancement of the national revolutionary situation; fourth, the existence of the Red Army; fifth, the strength of the Communist Party organization and the correctness of its policies. In the second article, Comrade Mao Zedong detailed the significance of the Red Army wars in China. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: the Red Army wars and the development of revolutionary base areas are "the highest form of peasant struggles in a semi-colonial country, and also the form that semi-colonial peasant struggles must take," and are "the most important ally of the proletarian struggle in a semi-colonial country" and "an important factor in promoting a national revolutionary upsurge." Comrade Mao Zedong believed: it is necessary to vigorously develop Red Army wars, develop land revolution, and establish revolutionary governments, "only in this way can the faith of the revolutionary masses throughout the country be established, as the Soviet Union did for the world; only in this way can great difficulties be given to the ruling class, shaking its foundation and promoting its internal disintegration; and only in this way can the Red Army be truly created, becoming an important tool for the future great revolution. In short, only in this way can the revolutionary upsurge be promoted." Thus, Comrade Mao Zedong found the only correct law of development for the Chinese revolution, which was defeated by a powerful enemy in the cities and temporarily unable to achieve victory in the cities, that is, to use armed revolutionary rural areas to surround and ultimately seize the cities occupied by the counter-revolutionaries. The development of the Chinese revolution in the following twenty years fully proved Comrade Mao Zedong's foresight.

During this period, Comrade Mao Zedong not only formulated the general trajectory of the Party's revolutionary development during the Second Civil War, but also made important innovations in various specific policies, such as in the policy of land revolution, in the policy towards the intermediate classes, in military strategy and tactics for defeating superior enemy forces, in army work, and in Party building work in rural and military environments. Based on the fact that poor peasants and hired laborers are the most revolutionary forces in rural areas, middle peasants are an important force firmly supporting the revolution, the economic status of rich peasants still needs to be preserved in the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution, and small-scale industry and commerce need to be protected and developed in the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly formulated and resolutely implemented the land revolution line of relying on poor peasants and hired laborers, uniting middle peasants, protecting rich peasants, protecting small-scale industrialists and merchants, and only eliminating the landlord class. Based on the fact that war and the army are the main forms of struggle and organization of the Chinese revolution, and based on the fact that the characteristics of the revolutionary war at that time were that the enemy was strong and we were weak, the enemy was large and we were small, and the enemy was detached from the masses while we were connected to the masses, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly formulated that the Red Army must be the propagandist and organizer of the Party, people's power, land reform, and all other local work, that the Red Army must establish strong political work and strict discipline among the masses within the army, that the Red Army must carry out people's war relying on the masses, that guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare with guerrilla characteristics should be the main forms of warfare at that time, that the Red Army must carry out strategic protracted warfare and tactical decisive warfare, that the army should be dispersed in peacetime to mobilize the masses and concentrated in wartime to surround and annihilate the enemy, and that these basic principles and other military principles constitute the military line of the Chinese revolutionary war. Due to all this, it can be said that Comrade Mao Zedong's work during this difficult period of the Chinese revolution had already laid the main foundation for leading the Chinese revolution to victory.

By 1930, the Red Army nationwide had developed to about 60,000 people, and the Red Army in the Central Jiangxi area had about 30,000 people. In 1930 and the following period, the scope of the revolutionary base areas had developed to Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Hainan Island in Guangdong. The rapid development of the Red Army caused great alarm to Chiang Kai-shek. At the end of 1930, Chiang Kai-shek sent seven divisions, totaling about 100,000 troops, to besiege the Central Red Army, resulting in the annihilation of one entire division and half of another, and the capture of the commander-in-chief of the frontline troops. Under the influence of the Red Army's victory, in February 1931, the 26th Army of the Nationalist Party, more than 10,000 strong, led by Zhao Bosheng and Dong Zhenchang, rebelled in Ningdu, Jiangxi, and joined the Red Army. In May 1931, Chiang Kai-shek again sent 200,000 troops, commanded by He Yingqin, to launch a second encirclement and suppression of the Central Red Army, resulting in the annihilation of more than 30,000 troops and the capture of more than 20,000 guns. In July of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek launched a third encirclement and suppression, personally commanding the operation, accompanied by British, Japanese, and German military advisors, leading 300,000 troops in three columns deep into the Central Red Army base area, but the result was again a failure. At the same time, the Red Army led by Comrade Xu Xiangqian, which was first in the E-Yu-Hu base area and later moved to the Northwest base area, and the Red Army in the Xiang-E-Xi base area led by Comrade He Long, also achieved many important victories. After these victories, the strength of the Red Army continued to develop, and a new revolutionary situation gradually matured.

It was at this time that the Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale invasion of Northeast China on September 18, 1931. The Japanese imperialists, who had decided to invade China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, saw that the capitalist world economic crisis since the end of 1929 had made countries like Britain and the United States busy with their internal affairs and had no time to compete with Japan for China. They also saw that the Chiang Kai-shek government had completely capitulated to imperialism and relied on the aid of British and American imperialism to carry out counter-revolutionary civil war and war against the workers' and peasants' red army, and dared not resist the Japanese invasion of China. Therefore, they decided to first invade Northeast China and then gradually expand their invasion to the mainland of China. In 1931, Japan quickly occupied the entire Northeast region, and in January 1932, entered Shanghai, in 1933, occupied Rehe and the northern part of Chahar, and in 1935, occupied the eastern part of Hebei.

The Japanese imperialist invasion fundamentally changed the political situation in China. Resisting the Japanese invasion became an urgent task and a universal demand of the people throughout the country. Workers, peasants, and students' anti-Japanese movements surged nationwide. The upper petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie, who had withdrawn from the revolution in 1927, changed their political attitudes at this time and began to become politically active, demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek government change its policy. The Chiang Kai-shek government, however, insisted on its policy of non-resistance to Japan, intensified the "extermination of communists" and fascist terror internally. However, even within the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang army, political divisions began to occur. In January 1932, the 19th Route Army of the Kuomintang, under the influence of the people's anti-Japanese movement in Shanghai, bravely resisted the Japanese army attacking Shanghai; in November 1933, the leaders of this army and other Kuomintang members established an anti-Chiang and pro-communist people's government in Fujian. In May 1933, Feng Yuxiang also cooperated with the communists to organize the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Zhangjiakou, Hebei.

In the face of the Japanese invasion, the Chinese Communist Party first advocated armed resistance and led or actively participated in the people's anti-Japanese movement and the guerrilla warfare of the people of Northeast China. In January 1933, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army declared its willingness to cease fire with all armies nationwide under the three conditions of stopping the attack on the Red Army, guaranteeing people's democratic rights, and arming the people, in order to jointly resist Japan. However, despite this, the Party leadership fell into a new serious "Left" error from 1931 to 1934, failing to advance the revolution in the favorable situation of the Japanese invasion, the Red Army's victories, and the people's anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang movements, but instead suffered a new setback.

Although there were lessons from the failure of the First Civil War and subsequent events, after the Sixth Congress, the Party's leadership organs were still located in the counter-revolutionary center of Shanghai, and the Party's leadership still did not focus on the Red Army wars, and still did not focus on Comrade Mao Zedong. The "Left" opportunists, who were impatient with petty-bourgeois sentiments, did not understand the significance and laws of the Red Army wars, and fantasized about launching urban uprisings under the white terror of the counter-revolution, continued to occupy the leading positions in the Party Central Committee. From June to October 1930, the Party Central Committee, led by Comrade Li Lisan, demanded the organization of a general uprising in the central cities nationwide and a general offensive of the Red Army on the central cities. This erroneous plan caused serious losses to the Party's secret organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, but in the Red Army, it was resisted by Comrade Mao Zedong and had no significant impact. In October 1930, the errors of Comrade Li Lisan were corrected by the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee. However, in January 1931, a new "Left" faction characterized by dogmatism, led by Comrades Chen Shaoyu (Wang Ming) and Qin Bangxian (Bo Gu), used the cloak of Marxist "theory" to attack the Third Plenary Session for not correcting the "rightist" deviation of the "Li Lisan Line" and, through the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee, took over the leadership of the Central Committee. The new "Left" faction led by Wang Ming and Bo Gu completely denied the major political changes caused by the Japanese invasion, regarding all factions of the Kuomintang and all intermediate factions as equally counter-revolutionary, and demanding that the Party engage in "death struggles" against them. This "Left" faction opposed Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare in the Red Army wars and continued to demand that the Red Army seize the central cities; in the problem of work in the Kuomintang-controlled cities, it opposed Comrade Liu Shaoqi's insistence on the idea of using legality to accumulate strength and continued to implement adventurous policies that alienated the majority of the masses. Under this erroneous leadership, the Party's organizations in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were almost completely destroyed, and the temporary Central Committee organized by the "Left" elements moved into the Central Red Army base area in 1933. After the temporary Central Committee arrived in the Red Army base area, although it had merged with the Central Committee members working in the Red Army and revolutionary base areas, such as Comrade Mao Zedong, to form the formal Central Committee, it excluded Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership of the Red Army. Thus, the revival of the revolution, as shown by the victories of the Red Army and the upsurge of the mass movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, was destroyed.

From June 1932 to February 1933, Chiang Kai-shek, who had just betrayed the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, again organized a fourth all-out encirclement and suppression of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army with 90 divisions and 500,000 troops. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's strategy, the Red Army achieved great victories in this anti-encirclement war. However, in October 1933, Chiang Kai-shek launched a fifth encirclement and suppression of the Red Army with 1 million troops, and attacked the Central Red Army with 500,000 troops. In this campaign, the Red Army, due to the Party Central Committee's implementation of a completely erroneous purely defensive military line and other erroneous policies, failed to break through the enemy's encirclement. In October 1934, the Central Red Army withdrew from the Jiangxi base area and embarked on the Long March, an unprecedented event in world history. During this period, other revolutionary base areas and Red Army units throughout the country also suffered the same damage from the "Left" elements. The Red Army units in various places, except for the Shaan-Gan Red Army led by Comrades Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang, successively withdrew from their original base areas and embarked on the Long March.

During the Long March of the Central Red Army, the Party Central Committee continued to make military mistakes, causing the Red Army, which was surrounded by the enemy in front and pursued by the enemy in the rear, to fall into danger several times and suffer heavy losses. To save the Red Army and the Chinese revolution from danger, the Party held an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in Zunyi, Guizhou, in January 1935, due to the resolute struggle of Comrade Mao Zedong and other comrades. Under the awakening and support of the majority of comrades, the Zunyi Meeting removed the leadership of the "Left" opportunists, established Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership in the Central Committee and the entire Party. From then on, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolution have been under the leadership of this outstanding, great, and completely reliable leader of Marxism-Leninism, which has provided the most important guarantee for the victory of the revolution.

In October 1935, one year after the Long March began, the Central Red Army finally, with extraordinary willpower, overcame countless military, political, and natural obstacles, traversed the 25,000-li journey, crossed the rarely trodden snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and reached northern Shaanxi, where it merged with the Shaan-Gan Red Army units. Comrades Ren Bishi and He Long led the Red Army units, and Comrade Xu Xiangqian led the Red Army units, which also merged with the Central Red Army in the Shaan-Gan area in October 1936. Zhang Guotao, who worked in the Red Army led by Comrade Xu Xiangqian, lost confidence in the revolutionary future and conducted activities to split and betray the Party, refusing to march north with the Central Red Army and instead forcing the troops to retreat to the Xikang area, and illegally organized another Central Committee under his leadership. Due to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct policy of intra-Party struggle and the perseverance of Comrades Zhu De, Ren Bishi, He Long, and Guan Xiangying, the traitor Zhang Guotao's split plot quickly failed, but the Red Army suffered another great loss. Before the fifth encirclement and suppression by the Kuomintang, the Red Army had developed to 300,000 people, but due to the erroneous leadership within the Party, it suffered many setbacks, and after the Long March, when it merged in Shaanbei, it totaled less than 30,000 people. But this was the most precious essence of the Red Army and the Party.

The victory of the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was the turning point for the Chinese revolution from danger to safety. It gave the people of the whole country hope for the future of the revolution and the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. It made the whole of China and the world believe that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Red Army were invincible forces, and that to defeat the Japanese imperialism that was encroaching on China at that time, it was necessary to rely on the Chinese Communist Party, and it was necessary to stop the anti-communist civil war.

In November 1935, immediately after the merger of the Central Red Army, the Shaanbei Red Army, and the Red Army that had marched north from the E-Yu-Hu and Xiang-E-Xi areas through the Long March, they jointly crushed the Kuomintang army's three encirclements and suppressions of the Shaan-Gan revolutionary base area, greatly consolidated the Shaan-Gan revolutionary base area, and expanded the prestige of the Red Army. Subsequently, due to the further advance of the Japanese imperialists into North China, the "December 9th" movement, which began with the anti-Japanese national salvation demonstration by Beijing students on December 9, developed nationwide, and the broad masses in the movement unanimously put forward the Party's proposed slogan of "Stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan." The revolution entered a new upsurge. At this time, it was necessary to make a correct analysis of the domestic situation since the Japanese invasion of China and to determine the Party's policy and correct the "Left" sectarianism that was deeply rooted within the Party. This work was something that the Party Central Committee from 1931 to 1934 could not complete, and Comrade Mao Zedong could not complete during the Long March in 1935. With the help of the correct policy of the anti-fascist united front decided by the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in August 1935, the Party's declaration calling for a united front issued on August 1, especially the resolution passed by the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee in Yan'an on December 25, and Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Tactics of Opposing Japanese Imperialism" at the Party's activist meeting on December 27, met this requirement.

Comrade Mao Zedong's report systematically raised the issue of establishing an anti-Japanese national united front. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, after pointing out that the left wing of the national bourgeoisie might participate in the anti-Japanese struggle while other parts might waver and become neutral, that the Kuomintang camp might split and that the Anglo-American comprador group within it might be forced to participate in the anti-Japanese struggle under certain conditions, and after pointing out the great significance of the Long March, summed up the Party's tasks as follows: "The task of the Party is to unite the activities of the Red Army with the activities of all workers, peasants, students, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie in the country, and to form a unified national revolutionary front." Comrade Mao Zedong refuted all the arguments of the "Left" opportunists within the Party against the united front. Comrade Mao Zedong proposed the slogan of the People's Republic to replace the slogan of the Workers' and Peasants' Republic, and also formulated the correct policy towards the national bourgeoisie in politics and economics. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: in the period of bourgeois democratic revolution, the People's Republic protects the national capitalists and their industries that do not support imperialism and its running dogs, and it is based on workers and peasants but also represents the interests of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: the difference between this united front and the united front of 1924-1927 is the presence of a strong Communist Party and revolutionary army. Comrade Mao Zedong, in comparing the differences between the two periods, said: "Today, this situation has changed. A strong Communist Party and a strong Red Army have already been established, and there are also revolutionary base areas. They not only initiate the anti-Japanese national united front but will also necessarily become the strong pillars in the future anti-Japanese government and anti-Japanese army, making the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek's policy of undermining the anti-Japanese national united front, or defeatism, unable to achieve their ultimate goal." Thus, Comrade Mao Zedong's report not only formulated the Party's policy at that time, foresaw the later development of Chinese politics, but also summed up the fundamental experience of the two periods of the civil war and formulated the fundamental line of the Party in the period of the democratic revolution.

The correct political line of the Central Committee of the Communist Party quickly achieved great results and quickly promoted the realization of the anti-Japanese war. The Red Army, in February 1936, marched east into Shanxi, and after achieving many victories, issued a telegram to the Kuomintang in May, calling for a ceasefire and joint resistance against Japan, and first realized a ceasefire with Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng in Shanxi. The Party's work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the anti-Japanese national salvation movements of various strata of people, under the correct guidance of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, were also restored and developed. However, Chiang Kai-shek still insisted on his reactionary policy against the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people and continued to attack the Red Army. On December 12, 1936, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, who demanded united resistance against Japan, detained Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an and forced him to stop the civil war that would lead to national destruction. The Chinese Communist Party believed that under the conditions at that time, in order to resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism, the Xi'an Incident should be peacefully resolved, so Chiang Kai-shek was released, and domestic peace was realized. In order to maintain domestic peace and to win over the landlord class to jointly resist Japan, the Party decided to temporarily suspend the policy of confiscating and distributing land from landlords after the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident. Due to the realization of domestic peace, when the Japanese imperialists launched a new attack on China on July 7, 1937, under the pretext of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Chinese army, including Chiang Kai-shek's army, resisted the Japanese attack, and the nationwide anti-Japanese war broke out. Due to the correct proposals and efforts of the Chinese Communist Party in the Xi'an Incident and afterwards, domestic peace and the anti-Japanese war were realized, greatly enhancing the Party's prestige among the people of the whole country.

In May 1937, the Party Central Committee convened the Party's National Representative Conference, which discussed and approved the Party's political line since 1935 and made political and organizational preparations for the anti-Japanese war.

In the years when the revolution was out of danger and entered a new upsurge, in order to summarize experience and train cadres, Comrade Mao Zedong made great efforts in theoretical work. In the autumn of 1936, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote the book "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," summarizing the experience of revolutionary wars from 1927 to 1936, expounding the characteristics of China's revolutionary wars, and systematically criticizing the errors of the military lines of the "Left" and "Right" opportunists. This is one of the most outstanding Marxist military works in the world communist movement. However, the significance of this book far exceeds the scope of purely military issues. It is actually a profound analysis of the laws of the Chinese revolution itself. Moreover, because it fundamentally dissects the sources of victory and failure in war, the process of understanding and learning the laws of war, and the various dialectical laws of war, it has become an important work of Marxist philosophy. In the summer of 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong also wrote his famous philosophical work "On Practice." In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong comprehensively, deeply, and yet popularly explained the epistemology of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong's work is of extremely important value in Chinese thought history and the Party's ideological work. It is the best textbook for educating people on how to think correctly, act correctly, and learn correctly. It analyzes the philosophical nature of the debates within the Party during the Second Civil War, exposes the dogmatist and empiricist errors of the "Left" and "Right" opportunists in their methods of cognition based on irrefutable materialist principles. Comrade Mao Zedong's work not only laid the foundation for the Marxist-Leninist education of the Chinese Communist Party but also made a brilliant contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism in the world.

The period of the Second Civil War was a period when the Party, under extremely difficult conditions, achieved political maturity and promoted a new upsurge of the revolution. In this period, mainly relying on the efforts of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party deeply understood the importance of military work and rural work, created revolutionary armies and rural revolutionary base areas, and learned to lead revolutionary wars, land reforms, and various government works. In this period, the Party recognized its true Marxist-Leninist leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and also recognized the harm of various "Left" petty-bourgeois ideologies, and in the struggle against various erroneous petty-bourgeois ideologies, established the leadership of the Party with Comrade Mao Zedong at the core. Unlike the first period of the civil war, when the main harm was right opportunism in the cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, in this period, the main error of the Party's leadership organs was "Left" opportunism; the "Left" errors caused the Party and the Red Army to suffer serious setbacks, thus delaying the new upsurge of the revolution. However, no matter what, the Party and the army, which had been tempered through various difficulties and twists and turns and had accumulated rich experience, constituted the main body that later led the anti-Japanese war and the war of liberation. Due to all the above, it can be said that the Second Civil War completed the most important political and cadre preparations for the victory of the Chinese revolution today.

From 1927 to 1937, the Party went through an extremely serious period of reaction. During this period, on the one hand, the enemy tried to completely annihilate our Party, and our Party and the enemy engaged in extremely arduous, complex, and heroic struggles; on the other hand, after overcoming the right opportunism of Chen Duxiu, the Party was again subjected to several invasions of "Left" opportunism, putting the Party in extremely dangerous situations. However, due to the creative Marxist-Leninist leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and his extraordinary patience and discipline, the Party's opportunist errors were fully and perfectly overcome, and the Party was saved from extremely dangerous situations. Thus, after going through a decade of reaction, the Party, under the onslaught and attacks of internal and external enemies, educated the broad masses of the people with revolutionary spirit nationwide, preserved the revolutionary banner of the Party among the people, and preserved the core of the Red Army and part of the revolutionary base areas, preserved a large number of outstanding cadres and tens of thousands of Party members, accumulated a large amount of revolutionary experience, especially experience in war and revolutionary base areas, to welcome the new revolutionary upsurge—the nationwide anti-Japanese patriotic war and the new cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang.

### 3. The Period of the Anti-Japanese War

On July 7, 1937, the Japanese invaders attacked the Chinese garrison at Lugou Bridge south of Beijing, and the Chinese garrison fought back. On August 13, the Japanese army again attacked Shanghai, and the Shanghai garrison also fought back. The country entered the Anti-Japanese War. Through agreements with the Kuomintang government, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the guerrilla units left behind in the southern provinces were successively reorganized into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, and marched to the front lines in North China and East China to participate in the Anti-Japanese War.

At that time, the basic political situation surrounding the Anti-Japanese War was as follows:

Internationally, there were three different forces: Japan, the Soviet Union, and Britain and the United States. The first force: Japan. Japanese imperialism was a ferocious invader. Japan's policy of annihilating all of China aroused the resistance of all patriotic people in China. Japan not only invaded China but also repeatedly challenged the Soviet Union, attempting to attack the Soviet Union under unprepared conditions, and at the same time used this posture to lure anti-Soviet policy-makers in Britain and the United States to make concessions to it. Japan's invasion of China seized the imperialist interests of Britain and the United States in China, threatening Britain and the United States' imperialist interests in the entire Southeast Asia and the Pacific, so there was a contradiction between Japan and Britain and the United States. As for the revolutionary forces of the Japanese people, they opposed Japanese imperialism in the war and aided the Chinese people, but their strength was too small to have a serious impact. The second force: the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union resolutely implemented the policy of supporting China's Anti-Japanese War, so in August 1937, it signed a non-aggression pact with China and provided financial and military aid to China. The Soviet Union also resolutely implemented a policy of peace, vigilantly avoiding falling into the trap of Britain and the United States' sitting on the sidelines and watching the tiger fight. However, after defeating Hitler's Germany in 1945, the Soviet Union quickly declared war on Japan. History has proven that the Soviet Union's policy was completely correct, both in line with the interests of the Soviet Union and in line with the interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The third force: Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States, at this time, were different from Japan and even more different from the Soviet Union. British and American imperialism did not want Japan to seize their interests in the East. However, they hoped to draw the war towards the Soviet Union so that they could sit on the sidelines and watch the tiger fight; they feared the rise of the Chinese people's power, which would harm their interests; and they were busy dealing with the tense situation in the West caused by Hitler, seeking to ease Japan's contradictions with them in the East, and feared Japan's attacks on them in the East. Therefore, until Japan launched attacks on Britain and the United States in 1941, they always tried to seek compromise with Japan or hoped that Japan and China would both be injured. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, especially after the United States gained the upper hand in the Pacific, the United States demanded that China actively counterattack Japan, but the plan of American imperialism was to use this situation to monopolize China, expel the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people, and turn China into an American colony. The counter-revolutionary two-faced policy of British and American imperialism required the Chinese people to unite with them in opposing Japanese aggression while at the same time being vigilant and opposing their plots to harm the Chinese people.

Domestically, there were three different forces: the people, the Kuomintang, and the traitors. The people were resolutely against Japan. The working class and the peasant class were the leaders and mainstays of the Anti-Japanese War. Under Japan's policy of annihilating all of China, not only the national bourgeoisie and the urban petty bourgeoisie stood on the side of anti-Japanese resistance, but some people from the landlord class, especially those enlightened gentry who had split from the landlord class, also stood on the side of anti-Japanese resistance. Therefore, the people's anti-Japanese united front was extremely broad. The traitors were resolutely attached to Japan, helping Japan invade China and oppress the Chinese people. Japan had used great efforts to buy the most reactionary part of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie and other scoundrels to act as traitors, and the long-term reactionary policy of the Kuomintang also helped the production of traitors. The Wang Jingwei faction within the Kuomintang soon went over to the Japanese side after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. However, the traitors were indeed few in number, and the people of the whole country were unanimously opposed to the traitors, and even the reactionary Kuomintang could not help but oppose them verbally. The problem lay with the Kuomintang. The main body of the Kuomintang, representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, was basically an Anglo-American comprador group, which had resolutely opposed the people and opposed anti-Japanese resistance in many years of reaction, and had been determined to annihilate the Communist Party. Chiang Kai-shek now stood up to resist Japan, first because the oppression of the people made him unable to resist Japan, otherwise the people of the whole country and many organized anti-Japanese forces would automatically stand up to resist Japan, and he would not be able to maintain his rule; second, because the direct threat to his regime and the property of the landlord bourgeoisie by the Japanese imperialist invasion of the whole country could no longer be reconciled; third, because of the contradiction between British and American imperialism and Japanese imperialism. Britain and the United States themselves did not want to offend Japan, but wanted China and Japan to fight, tying down Japan. Due to these reasons, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Anti-Japanese War showed its contradictory counter-revolutionary two-faced nature: on the one hand, he wanted to resist Japan and also wanted other forces to actively resist Japan, and in the early stage of the war, he had shown a certain degree of anti-Japanese initiative, hoping to achieve a quick victory; on the other hand, he continued to oppose the people, continued to oppress the people, and did not want the people to stand up to resist Japan, especially did not want the Communist Party and other anti-Japanese forces to mobilize the people to resist Japan. He wanted to monopolize the leadership of anti-Japanese resistance, but he refused to implement any real democratic reforms, striving to limit the development of the people's power, especially the development of the power of the Communist Party. He had secretly calculated that in the Anti-Japanese War, he would use the Japanese warlords to annihilate the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and other anti-Japanese forces, while preserving his own strength. For this purpose, he commanded the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to undertake the most frontline and the most severe combat missions in the enemy's rear. He did not believe that relying on China's power could achieve victory in the Anti-Japanese War, so he did not rely on and did not want to rely on the power of the Chinese people themselves, but placed his hopes on foreign aid. He hoped to quickly provoke British and American intervention in Japan, letting Britain and the United States fight for him, especially hoping for the United States. However, the later facts were that British and American intervention did not come, and Britain and the United States kept making compromises with Japan; the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which entered the enemy's rear, were not annihilated by the Japanese army but instead united with the broad masses in the rear, achieving continuous victories and great development; the anti-Japanese power of the people of the whole country greatly broke through the scope allowed and limited by him, achieving great development; while his own army was largely annihilated and suffered heavy losses in the war of resistance, his prestige rapidly declined. All this could not but cause his disappointment and fear. From then on, he implemented passive resistance to Japan, actively opposing the Communist Party and the people, avoiding battles, preserving strength, accumulating strength, waiting for other anti-Japanese forces to defeat Japan, and then using the preserved and accumulated strength to annihilate the Communist Party and the people's power. This was the basic position and policy of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Anti-Japanese War. American imperialism, except for being somewhat dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's passive resistance, in fact completely supported Chiang Kai-shek's position and policy, so no matter how dissatisfied American public opinion was with Chiang Kai-shek, the American government used all means to aid Chiang Kai-shek in the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War. Thus, Chiang Kai-shek was different from both the traitors and the anti-Japanese people. The anti-Japanese people demanded the unity of all forces that could be united in the country, first of all, mobilizing the power of the people to wage the Anti-Japanese War, so it was necessary to unite with Chiang Kai-shek to a certain extent to promote the Kuomintang's army to resist Japan, and at the same time, it was necessary to firmly struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policy to safeguard the people's power, mobilize the power of the people to strive for victory, and not be weakened and overwhelmed by Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, but be able to overcome Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism.

Comrade Mao Zedong correctly assessed the complex political situation in the Anti-Japanese War. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: the dispute between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the dispute between the proletariat and the big landlords and big bourgeoisie participating in the war (the Chiang Kai-shek clique), was no longer the question of whether to resist Japan, but the question of how to achieve victory. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: there were two opposing lines in the Anti-Japanese War, namely, the line of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie represented by Chiang Kai-shek, and the line of the proletariat and the people of the whole country represented by the Communist Party; implementing the line of the Kuomintang, which wanted only the Kuomintang government to resist Japan and not the people of the whole country to resist Japan, the war would inevitably fail; only by implementing the line of people's war or "all-out resistance," the war could be won. In August 1937, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a meeting held near Luochuan, Yanan, based on Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal, adopted the famous "Ten-Point Program for Anti-Japanese National Salvation," as a guideline for the Party to lead the people of the whole country to achieve victory in the Anti-Japanese War and oppose Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary two-faced policy. The Luochuan Meeting decided to launch independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear, making guerrilla warfare undertake the strategic tasks of cooperating with the frontline, opening up the rear battlefield, and establishing anti-Japanese base areas in the rear, and decided to launch anti-Japanese mass movements in all Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Luochuan Meeting decided to fight for the people's democratic and livelihood rights necessary for the interests of the Anti-Japanese War, and decided to take rent reduction and interest reduction as the basic policy to solve the peasant problem during the Anti-Japanese War.

Title: The Struggle Between Two Lines in the Anti-Japanese War and the Establishment of the People's Republic of China

The debate over the two lines in the Anti-Japanese War also had serious repercussions within the Party. Some comrades who had committed serious "leftist" errors during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, with Wang Ming (Chen Shaoyu) as their representative, now stood on the right-opportunist position to criticize and oppose the Party's line. They violated Party discipline and, in the work they were responsible for, arbitrarily implemented their own right-opportunist line. They saw the temporary weakness of the Communist Party and its military forces, and the apparent strength of the Kuomintang, and incorrectly concluded that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War depended on the Kuomintang and that it would inevitably be a victory for the Kuomintang rather than the people. They believed that the Kuomintang could become the leader of the Anti-Japanese War and denied that the Communist Party could become the leader. They underestimated the role of the guerrilla warfare led by the Communist Party in the Anti-Japanese War and fantasized about relying on the Kuomintang army to achieve a quick victory. They trusted the Kuomintang more than the masses. They ignored the fundamental differences between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang in the Anti-Japanese War, demanding that the Communist Party make concessions to the Kuomintang's anti-people policies, advocating that the actions of the Communist Party be subject to the Kuomintang government, and that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army be completely unified with the Kuomintang army, implementing "unified command, unified organization, unified armament, unified discipline, unified battle plans, and unified battle actions." They denied the independence within the united front and the revolutionary policy of "unity and struggle, seeking unity through struggle." They opposed the full mobilization of mass struggles and opposed the expansion of liberated areas and the expansion of people's armed forces in areas occupied by Japan. They were afraid that this would "scare away" Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang from the anti-Japanese front and advocated limiting their actions within the scope allowed by Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. Without the approval of the Central Committee, they issued many declarations, resolutions, and articles expressing erroneous views and rejected the correct instructions of the Central Committee. This erroneous thinking and action had an impact in the activities of Wang Ming in Wuhan in 1938 and in the work of Yeming in the New Fourth Army before the "Anqing Incident" in January 1941, thus hindering the development of the Anti-Japanese War in the Yangtze River basin at that time and resulting in the failure of the New Fourth Army in the Anqing Incident. It is clear that the opinions of the rightists were in line with the interests of Chiang Kai-shek and harmful to the interests of the proletariat and the Anti-Japanese people. This was the revival of Chen Duxiu's right opportunism in the First Revolutionary Civil War under new conditions.

To thoroughly clarify the erroneous thoughts within and outside the Party about the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote "On Protracted War" in May 1938. In this work, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed in detail the political and military situation of China and Japan, pointed out the inevitable victory of the war, but emphasized that the war would inevitably be a protracted war and could not be won quickly, and that China must rely on the policy of people's war to win.

In October 1938, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in Yan'an. This meeting approved the line of the Central Political Bureau led by Comrade Mao Zedong on the Anti-Japanese War and the Anti-Japanese National United Front. The meeting criticized the erroneous line of capitulationism on the united front issue, decided to independently and vigorously organize people's armed anti-Japanese struggles, and put the Party's main work in the war zones and enemy-occupied areas, while criticizing the erroneous idea of relying on the Kuomintang army to win the Anti-Japanese War and fantasizing about relying on the Kuomintang reactionaries to achieve the people's destiny through legal movements.

The actual development of the Anti-Japanese War proved the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Although Chiang Kai-shek's army initially resisted the Japanese army, due to Chiang Kai-shek's political and military mistakes, the army quickly collapsed. By October 1938, they had to retreat from Guangzhou and Wuhan. Chiang Kai-shek then concentrated his main forces in the southwestern and northwestern regions of China, centered on Chongqing and Xi'an, to avoid fighting the Japanese army. In contrast, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party of China successively armed the masses in North China, East China, South China, and other regions, developed a powerful Anti-Japanese guerrilla war, and established many Anti-Japanese democratic base areas. By the third anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War in 1940, the people's Anti-Japanese army led by the Communist Party of China had grown from over 40,000 in the previous three years to nearly 500,000, fighting against half of the Japanese army in China. In the three years of fighting, they recovered 150 counties, killed and wounded 400,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers, and liberated an area with a population of nearly 100 million. The number of Communist Party members also grew from 40,000 in the previous three years to 800,000. From Liaoning, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan to Guangdong and Hainan Island, there were people's Anti-Japanese armed forces led by Communist Party members. The Anti-Japanese War had become a real national revolution.

The great development of the guerrilla war in the enemy's rear made the Japanese invaders, after occupying Wuhan and Guangzhou, fall into a stalemate in the war and could not advance further, because their rear was exposed to the attacks of powerful guerrilla forces. They had to turn around to attack the guerrilla forces in their rear. Japan decided to put the main pressure on the rear battlefields, stop strategic offensives against Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, and implement the policy of "burning, killing, and looting" to destroy the base areas. At this time, the Communist Party of China put forward the slogans of "persisting in resistance, opposing surrender; persisting in unity, opposing split; persisting in progress, opposing retrogression," leading the people of the whole country to fight against the reactionary trend of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang. The danger of Chiang Kai-shek's surrender reached its peak in September 1939 when the Fascist Germany declared war on Britain and France. At this time, Britain and the United States hoped to quickly sacrifice China to seek a compromise with Japan, so that Japan would not join Hitler to oppose Britain and the United States. To make China surrender, they had to intensify their opposition to the Communist Party, which insisted on the Anti-Japanese War. Under these circumstances, from the end of 1939 to the beginning of 1940, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang launched the first wave of anti-Communist attacks. The reactionary army of the Kuomintang occupied five counties in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, attacked the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Corps led by Communist Party members in western Shanxi, and attacked the Eighth Route Army led by the Communist Party in southeastern Shanxi. The Eighth Route Army, besieged by both the Japanese and the Kuomintang, resolutely repelled the Kuomintang's attack.

A serious struggle was placed before the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. It was clear that in Japan's invasion of China, whoever could win the Anti-Japanese War would win the victory of the whole country. Since the Communist Party of China had proven itself to be the true leader of the Anti-Japanese War, it must also explain to the people of the whole country its entire view on the Chinese revolution and the construction of a new China, so as to thoroughly disarm the Kuomintang reactionaries and their followers spiritually and arm the Chinese working class and the revolutionary people of China with sufficient spiritual weapons. This task was undertaken by Comrade Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy" published in January 1940. "On New Democracy" explained, from the history of China and the world, that after the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the leadership of the Chinese revolution must belong to the Chinese working class; it explained that the Chinese revolution must be divided into two stages: the new democratic stage and the socialist stage, and that under the leadership of the working class, the future of new democracy must inevitably be socialism; it explained that in the period of the new democratic revolution, the Party must adopt a new democratic political program, economic program, and cultural program that are different from both capitalism and socialism. The publication of "On New Democracy" greatly helped the unification of thought within the Party and among the revolutionary people of the whole country, greatly helped the unification of policies in all the liberated areas of the country, and thus greatly strengthened the Chinese revolution.

To continue to expand and consolidate the Anti-Japanese National United Front, after overcoming the rightist deviation, the Party took a series of measures to correct the "leftist" deviation that began to occur in the struggle against the Kuomintang's attacks on the Communist Party and the people. The Party believed that during the Anti-Japanese War, due to the deep invasion of the enemy into the country, the national contradiction remained the main contradiction, and as long as the Kuomintang did not surrender to the Japanese army, it was necessary and possible to maintain unity with the Kuomintang without breaking it. The struggle against the Kuomintang must be limited to not breaking it. For the middle bourgeoisie and enlightened gentry, more attention should be paid to unity. Therefore, the Party formulated the general policy of "developing progressive forces, winning over intermediate forces, and isolating diehard forces," and the guiding principles of "reasonable, beneficial, and moderate" in the struggle against friction within the united front, and implemented the "three-thirds" system in all the governments of the liberated areas, that is, one-third Communist Party members (representing the working class and poor peasants), one-third progressive elements (representing the petty bourgeoisie), and one-third intermediate elements (representing the middle bourgeoisie and enlightened gentry).

Chiang Kai-shek, in order to weaken the strength of the Communist Party, launched the second wave of anti-Communist attacks in January 1941. Chiang Kai-shek ordered the headquarters of the New Fourth Army and its affiliated troops of more than 10,000 people to cross the Yangtze River to the north. On January 7, more than 80,000 troops surrounded and attacked them on the way. The New Fourth Army suffered heavy losses, with Commander-in-Chief Ye Ting captured and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Yeming martyred. Chiang Kai-shek, after achieving his plot, immediately announced the dissolution of the New Fourth Army and ordered an attack on other New Fourth Army troops. This incident was called the "Anqing Incident." The Communist Party of China strongly refuted Chiang Kai-shek's order to dissolve the New Fourth Army, prepared to smash the Kuomintang's attack, and made the main force of the New Fourth Army more consolidated than before the incident and achieved greater development in the East China region. Due to the great efforts of the Communist Party of China in the work of the united front before and after this incident, Chiang Kai-shek's anti-Communist policy did not isolate the Communist Party but instead awakened and educated many people who had illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, thus isolating Chiang Kai-shek himself.

However, the Anqing Incident was the beginning of the difficulties for the Chinese people. Since the beginning of 1941, Japan had already concentrated more than 60% of its invading army in China on the battlefield of the liberated areas and implemented the policy of "burning, killing, and looting" to destroy the liberated areas. The Kuomintang troops left in the enemy's rear mostly surrendered to the enemy and became puppet troops, with more than 90% of them attacking the liberated areas under the command of the Japanese. Chiang Kai-shek had secretly ordered many of his troops to surrender to the Japanese and then, under the command of the Japanese, to attack the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. In July 1941, the Fascist Germany invaded the Soviet Union, and the Japanese invaders launched attacks in the Pacific against Britain and the United States; the initial progress of the Fascist front in the war further encouraged the Kuomintang reactionaries to surrender, collude, encircle the liberated areas, and engage in anti-Communist and anti-people dark currents. The Kuomintang reactionaries used all means to weaken the strength of the Communist Party and the people. Under these circumstances, the area, population, and army of the liberated areas all shrank, and the finances of the liberated areas faced great difficulties. The Party had to make even greater efforts to overcome these difficulties. The Party led the organs, schools, and troops of the liberated areas to implement self-sufficiency through production, streamline the administration, and reduce the burden on the people, and at the same time, led the people to organize and develop agricultural production and provide relief for disasters. With the development of production, the Party also led the peasants to carry out a large-scale rent reduction and interest reduction movement. To resist the enemy under new conditions, the liberated areas greatly developed the militia. In addition to carrying out the struggle against "sweeping," the liberated areas sent armed work teams to the "rear of the rear" to restore and expand the liberated areas. Through these efforts, all difficulties were overcome, the liberated areas were further consolidated, and from 1943, they began to gradually expand again.

The Party took advantage of this period of relatively stable situation to carry out a large-scale Marxist-Leninist education throughout the Party. This education, which was difficult to carry out on a large scale during the rapid development or rapid changes of the war and revolution, was carried out using the method of the Rectification Movement. The Party led the cadres and members of the whole Party to recognize and overcome the widespread petty-bourgeois ideological style in the Party, especially the tendency of subjectivism, sectarianism, and the forms of these two tendencies—Party jargon. Comrade Mao Zedong's speeches "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style," "Oppose Party Jargon," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speeches "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members" and "On Party Struggles" played a great role in this learning movement. This learning movement eliminated the pernicious influence of dogmatism in the Party since 1931, helped a large number of new Party members from petty-bourgeois intellectual backgrounds to abandon the petty-bourgeois standpoint and take the proletarian standpoint, thus greatly raising the Party's ideological level and making the whole Party more united than ever before.

While the Communist Party was struggling hard to advance, the Kuomintang's rule became more and more corrupt. The Kuomintang's leaders used their political positions, especially the Anti-Japanese War, inflation, and other means, to amass a large amount of wealth, controlling China's finance, commerce, industry, and agriculture, and carrying out unrestrained plunder. They rapidly developed the feudal, comprador, and military monopoly capital, that is, the "bureaucratic capital," with Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu as the leaders. The "bureaucratic capital" of the Kuomintang was in sharp contradiction with the interests of the working class, peasant class, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Because the people's lives were extremely miserable, there was no political freedom to resist Japan, and the people's resentment was boiling over, and rebellions were rampant. Despite its own corruption and isolation, Chiang Kai-shek launched the third wave of anti-Communist attacks in June 1943 in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. However, under the vigilant handling of the Communist Party of China, the attack of the Kuomintang army was repelled, and this wave of anti-Communist attacks was smashed. Obviously, at this time, Chiang Kai-shek still thought that his hundreds of thousands of troops in the rear of the war were his stronghold, and he did not know that his reactionary policies had already corrupted his army; this truth was fully revealed in Japan's new offensive in 1944.

1944 was a year of great development in the world's anti-Fascist war, a year when the Hitler gang was annihilated under the brave attack of the Soviet army, but it was also a year when the Kuomintang army suffered another great defeat in Japan's new offensive. Japan's position in the Pacific was becoming more and more difficult, and it urgently needed to open the railway line from Beijing to Guangzhou and Nanning, so in March 1944, it launched a new offensive against the frontline battlefields. Because the Kuomintang army fled at the sight of the enemy, the Japanese quickly occupied most of Henan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and part of Guizhou, causing heavy losses to the people. Under the great encouragement of the great victory of the world anti-Fascist war led by the Soviet Union and the development of the victory of the battlefield of the Chinese people's liberation army, the people of the whole country could no longer tolerate the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The people's democratic struggles and the activities of the democratic parties in the Kuomintang-controlled areas became active. The demand to reorganize the Kuomintang government into a democratic coalition government became the unanimous call of the patriotic people.

However, the people's democratic struggle encountered new foreign interference. The Kuomintang reactionary government, which was hated by the people and on the verge of collapse, was supported by the American imperialism, which had gained superiority in the Pacific. In September 1944, Comrade Lin Boqu, the representative of the Communist Party of China, at the National Political Consultative Conference convened by the Kuomintang in Chongqing, demanded the immediate convening of an emergency national conference, the abolition of the Kuomintang's dictatorship, and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. The Kuomintang reactionaries, with the secret support of the American representative, stubbornly rejected the demands of the Communist Party and various democratic parties. American imperialism, before the Pacific War in 1941, had tried to sacrifice China to seek a compromise with Japan, but now it used the Anti-Japanese War to further extend its influence into China, intending to monopolize the Chinese market after the war and turn China into an American colony. Therefore, it actively worked to maintain the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. American imperialism, on the one hand, sent a large number of officers to train and arm Chiang Kai-shek's army and sent a large number of experts to infiltrate Chiang Kai-shek's government, and on the other hand, put on a fair face to "mediate" the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, the American government quickly exposed its consistent stance with Chiang Kai-shek. The American representative and Chiang Kai-shek both tried to use the method of "inviting" some Communist Party members to participate in the Kuomintang government to "complete" the "unification" and "democratization" of the Kuomintang reactionary government, to cancel the demand to reorganize the Kuomintang government into a democratic coalition government, and to eliminate the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the liberated areas. After the Communist Party of China rejected the malicious proposal of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Kai-shek even demanded the establishment of a three-person committee with the participation of Americans to "reorganize" the army of the liberated areas; while the American representative Hurley threatened that the United States would only cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek and not with the Communist Party of China.

On April 24, 1945, the Communist Party of China held its Seventh National Congress in Yan'an. The Congress had 544 official representatives and 208 alternate representatives, representing 1,210,000 Party members. The Congress listened to and unanimously adopted Comrade Mao Zedong's political report "On the Coalition Government" and Comrade Zhu De's military report "On the Battlefield of the Liberated Areas," and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's organizational report "On the Party," and adopted a new Party Constitution. The Congress elected a new Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong as its head.

At the Seventh Congress, the Communist Party of China showed unprecedented unity. This unity was formed by the victory of the Chinese revolution under the correct leadership of the Central Committee since the Zunyi Conference in January 1935; the rectification movement throughout the Party in 1942, the discussion on the Party's historical experience before the Seventh Congress, and the "Resolution on Some Historical Questions" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee all greatly helped the unification of thought throughout the Party. The Seventh Congress unanimously adopted the Party's general line, the general program of the Party in the period of the new democratic revolution, and the specific program. The Seventh Congress analyzed the current international and domestic situation, calling on the whole Party and the people of the whole country to fight for the final victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. To welcome the victory of the whole country, the Congress specially required the whole Party to pay timely attention to strengthening work in cities, especially among the working class. The Congress pointed out that under the direct leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people had already established 19 liberated areas in the war, with a population of 95,550,000, 910,000 people's liberation army (including the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and other people's Anti-Japanese armies), and 2,200,000 part-time militia who did not leave their production. Since 1944, they had already launched a partial counteroffensive. From September 1937 to March 1945, the people's liberation army fought more than 115,000 battles against the enemy, killing and wounding 960,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers, capturing 280,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers, and forcing 100,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers to surrender and defect. Most of the major cities, transportation lines, and coastal lines in the country were under the siege or control of the people's liberation army. Relying on the powerful people's liberation army and the unity of the people of the whole country, the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the democratic cause was guaranteed. However, due to the existence of domestic and foreign reactionary forces, the Congress also required the people of the whole country to be vigilant against the danger of a new nationwide civil war and imperialist intervention.

After the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of China, the people's liberation army's counteroffensive against the Japanese invaders developed rapidly. On August 8, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, immediately bringing the Chinese Anti-Japanese War into its final stage. The Soviet army quickly annihilated the Japanese Kwantung Army and liberated Northeast China. The people's liberation army actively annihilated the Japanese and puppet troops and liberated a large number of small and medium-sized cities occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops. On August 14, Japan announced its unconditional surrender. However, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese army and puppet troops in China to continue to "maintain local order" and continue to resist the people's liberation army surrounding the Japanese army, waiting for the Kuomintang army in the distant rear to come to accept the surrender. The American army, navy, and air force, at this time, used various methods to transport the Kuomintang army to the cities and major transportation lines occupied by the Japanese and puppet troops to "receive" the surrender. With the cooperation of the American army, the Japanese invading army, and the puppet army, Chiang Kai-shek once again gained the "superiority" in the country.

The experience of the Chinese people's Anti-Japanese War is the experience of a backward country resisting the invasion of an imperialist power, and it is also the experience of the proletariat, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and even a part of the landlords and comprador bourgeoisie, led by the Communist Party, united to resist the invasion. The Communist Party of China correctly analyzed this complex situation and correctly used the political and military experience of the two revolutionary civil wars from 1924 to 1936, thus adopting the correct political and military lines, timely correcting the deviations within the Party, repelling the domestic reactionaries, and winning a great victory, laying a solid foundation for the victory of the people's democratic revolution in the country. The Chinese Anti-Japanese War proved that under the correct leadership of the proletariat, relying on the unity and struggle of the people, relying on the united front of the people and the people's war, the invasion of imperialism can be defeated. This is an extremely important truth for the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Anti-Japanese War also proved that Anglo-American imperialism has always been hostile to the people of colonies and semi-colonies, and only the Soviet Union has been a loyal helper of the oppressed people of the world. The assistance of the Soviet Union has a decisive significance for the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world. This is also an extremely important truth for the Chinese people and the people of the world.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the class relations in China underwent new changes.

The Kuomintang reactionaries, representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, had been passive in resisting Japan and active in opposing the Communists during the Anti-Japanese War, trying to weaken the strength of the Communist Party, preserve and accumulate their own strength, so that after relying on the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Chinese people represented by the Communist Party to defeat Japan, they could reap the benefits of the fisherman, and then launch an anti-Communist war, annihilate the Communist Party, and establish their dark dictatorship in the country. For this purpose, the Kuomintang reactionaries preserved all the weapons provided by foreign aid to the Kuomintang to resist Japan for use in the anti-Communist war. Therefore, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the crisis of civil war immediately threatened the people of the whole country. American imperialism, after Japan's surrender, tried to replace Japan in China, control the vast Chinese market, and turn China into an American colony. For this purpose, the United States had to aid the Kuomintang to annihilate the Communist Party because the Communist Party was the biggest obstacle to the United States achieving this goal. The Kuomintang also had to rely on American aid to carry out the anti-Communist civil war. American imperialism and the Kuomintang joined forces on this basis, actively preparing to launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas. They believed that relying on the numerical and equipment superiority of the Kuomintang army over the people's liberation army, relying on the superiority of the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the liberated areas in population and resources, and relying on the political, economic, and military support of the American government for the Kuomintang government, they could achieve this evil and shameful goal.

The anti-people war was a profitable business for the big bourgeoisie, that is, the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalist group. Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu, the four big families, after Japan's surrender, had already used the name of "receiving" to carry out unprecedented annexation and plunder, and the inflation and various taxes, bonds, economic controls implemented under the pretext of war made them able to plunder the blood and sweat of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas on a large scale, so that their wealth quickly accumulated to as much as 200 million US dollars.

The policy of the Kuomintang in the Anti-Japanese War had already made its contradictions with the working class, peasant class, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie in the country extremely sharp. After experiencing many years of war, all classes of people in the country universally demanded peace to restore the severely damaged production. The people demanded national independence and political democracy after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The peasants demanded land. However, the Kuomintang not only did not give them all this, but also decided to throw them back into the abyss of civil war and bankruptcy. The Kuomintang, in order to obtain American aid, gave various privileges to the United States, making the national industry and commerce in the Kuomintang-controlled areas suffer double oppression from American capital and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, and they closed down one after another, with workers losing their jobs in large numbers. The American military and other personnel in China gave various insults and harm to the Chinese people. The Kuomintang's secret police continued to use terrorist methods to persecute the people and democratic personages. The Kuomintang government in the Kuomintang-controlled areas gave the peasants forced conscription and forced grain procurement, and in the liberated areas, it organized landlords to seize the land that the peasants had already obtained.

The civil war decided by the Kuomintang reactionaries was inevitable, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were so isolated among the people, but the people who demanded peace still hoped to avoid war at all costs before the civil war broke out completely, and did not want to break with the Kuomintang. In the national bourgeoisie and its parties, there was still an illusion about the Kuomintang and the United States, and there was still an illusion of seeking a "third way" outside the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The Communist Party of China had long been aware of the Kuomintang and American imperialism's plot for civil war and had made full preparations in terms of thought and organization. However, in order to save peace at the last moment and to fully educate the people, the Communist Party of China, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, still made great efforts and patience to lead the people of the whole country to seek a way to avoid war and achieve peace and unity.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a "Declaration on the Current Situation" on August 25, 1945, expressing the Communist Party of China's desire for peace, democracy, and unity. To realize this desire, Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing on August 28 to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang for more than a month, and finally published the results of the negotiation on October 10, which included many agreements on guaranteeing domestic peace. The Communist Party of China was prepared to faithfully implement the agreements it had agreed to and had already begun to implement them, but on the part of Chiang Kai-shek, these agreements were only seen as a cover for launching a war. Chiang Kai-shek thought that after the agreement was reached, the vigilance of the Communist Party would inevitably be relaxed, and he would seize the opportunity to attack and would certainly achieve great victory. Therefore, after the agreement was published, Chiang Kai-shek immediately launched an attack on the liberated areas. However, the Communist Party of China was already on guard, and Chiang Kai-shek's military attack was smashed.

However, the war had not yet fully broken out. Because Chiang Kai-shek's troops that had avoided the Anti-Japanese War were still in the distant southwest and northwest, while the people's liberation army that had been on the front line of the Anti-Japanese War was in North China, East China, and Northeast China, this situation made it temporarily unfavorable for Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters to launch a full-scale civil war. At that time, they still needed to quickly "receive" the enemy-occupied cities and transportation lines and transport hundreds of thousands of troops to the front line to launch a civil war, and these things Chiang Kai-shek could not do alone. To do these things, American imperialism gave Chiang Kai-shek the greatest help. The American army landed in China's coastal areas, accepted Japan's surrender, prevented the liberation army from accepting the surrender, and handed over all the weapons of the Japanese army to Chiang Kai-shek. The American air force and navy also transported hundreds of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's troops to the outskirts of the liberated areas to launch an attack on the liberated areas. To do these things well, they needed time. To gain this time, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the demand of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and the people of the whole country to announce a ceasefire on January 10, 1946, and immediately convened a political consultation conference including various parties. The American government also advocated a ceasefire at that time. The United States had signed the Moscow Declaration of the Three Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain on December 27, 1945, which expressed the hope that China would maintain peace and guarantee not to interfere in China's internal affairs. The American government sent Marshall to replace Hurley to continue to "mediate" the civil war in China. However, in fact, Marshall's task was only to help Chiang Kai-shek speed up the preparation for war. After everything was ready, Chiang Kai-shek first attacked the people's liberation army that had entered Northeast China before and after Japan's surrender, occupying a large area south of the Changchun-Jilin line to Anshan and west to Chengde. Subsequently, from July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek completely tore up the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the political consultation conference, commanding his entire forces to launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas, continuously occupying many cities and vast rural areas in the liberated areas.

During this period, the Communist Party of China carried out extensive and effective education for the people of the whole country, making the people of the whole country gradually wake up from the illusion of peace and the illusion of Chiang Kai-shek and the American government, and realize that to achieve peace, democracy, and independence, and to survive, they had to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and drive out American imperialism. The Communist Party of China, on the one hand, fully isolated American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek politically, and on the other hand, led the people's liberation army to make serious efforts to smash Chiang Kai-shek's attack. The Communist Party of China believed that Chiang Kai-shek's attack not only had to be defeated but also could be defeated. This was because the enemy's military superiority and American aid could only play a temporary role, while the justice or injustice of the war, the support of the people, could play a constant role, and in this regard, due to the correct efforts of the Communist Party of China for domestic peace, the advantage was definitely on the side of the people's liberation army.

To defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attack, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a resolute policy in the military field, that is, to take the annihilation of the enemy's effective forces as the main target, not to take the defense of cities or places as the main target; and to annihilate the enemy, every battle must be prepared, must be confident, and must concentrate absolute superiority of forces several times greater than the enemy to surround the enemy and annihilate the enemy, avoiding unprepared and unconfident battles. Under this policy, although the people's liberation army retreated from many cities and places in the early stage of the war, it annihilated a large number of Kuomintang troops, averaging about eight brigades and divisions of Kuomintang troops per month, using the captured equipment of the Kuomintang army to arm itself, and using the captured soldiers to reform and supplement itself. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek's full-scale attack, after suffering heavy losses for eight months, had to change the full-scale attack on the liberated areas to a "focused attack" in two areas, that is, taking Shandong and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia as the focus of the attack. However, the people's liberation army again seriously fought and smashed Chiang Kai-shek's "focused attack" on Shandong and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and at the same time, in Northeast China, Jin-Cha-Ji, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, and other areas, successively launched counterattacks. Therefore, by July 1947, the people's liberation army was able to launch a counterattack first in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield, advancing south of the Yellow River to the north bank of the Yangtze River. Following this, the people's liberation army also launched a large-scale offensive in Northeast China and other battlefields, fundamentally changing the situation of all battlefields. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's attack was completely broken after a little more than a year.

American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek were intoxicated by the superficial victory in the early stage of the war, rejecting all peace proposals of the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole country, resulting in their own military and political dead ends. On October 11, 1946, the Kuomintang army occupied the main city of the North China liberated area, Zhangjiakou. On the same afternoon, Chiang Kai-shek violated the resolutions of the political consultation conference and ordered the convening of a split and dictatorial fake "National Assembly." On November 15, this fake "National Assembly" opened under the support of the American envoy Marshall and the American ambassador Stuart, and passed the fake "Constitution." However, it was proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction in "On the Coalition Government" was correct, and this step of Chiang Kai-shek was only "putting a noose around his own neck" and did not receive any support from the people. In March 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries ordered the Communist Party personnel in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to withdraw to Yan'an, and then sent troops to attack and occupy Yan'an. From then on, any hope of a peaceful settlement was eliminated. However, all this only made the people, including the national bourgeoisie, concentrate their sympathy and hope on the Communist Party of China. The propaganda of the "third way" representing the right-wing of the national bourgeoisie also collapsed. The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the Democratic Construction Association, and other democratic parties and a large number of social personages all refused to cooperate with the Kuomintang reactionaries and refused to participate in the fake National Assembly and the reactionary government. At the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, students across the country held demonstrations against the American military's rape of Chinese female students. In May 1947, students across the country again held demonstrations against hunger, against civil war, and against oppression. Workers and peasants in various places also carried out many struggles against the Kuomintang. All this showed that American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries had been completely isolated, while the united front of the new democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China had been more expanded and consolidated than ever before. The conditions for the victory of the Chinese people in the country, both militarily and politically, had already matured.

On October 10, 1947, the people's liberation army issued a declaration calling on the people of the whole country to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and build a new China. To meet the long-standing demand of the peasants for land, the Communist Party of China on the same day promulgated the Land Law Outline, announcing the abolition of the feudal land system and the implementation of the land system of "the land belongs to the tiller." The land reform mobilized the peasants in the liberated areas to the fullest extent, eliminated the landlord class in the liberated areas, and greatly consolidated the liberated areas, aiding the people's liberation war. At the same time, to implement the land reform, strengthen the combat effectiveness of the people's liberation army, and strengthen the democratization of the countryside, the Communist Party of China led the whole Party to carry out a rectification movement to raise the class consciousness of the people's liberation army, overcome the phenomenon of impure composition and impure style in the countryside Party, and prepare for new victories. To prepare for new victories, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia in December 1947, where Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "The Current Situation and Our Tasks." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the Chinese people's revolutionary war had reached a turning point, and this turning point was also the turning point of "the imperialist rule in China from development to annihilation." Regarding the military, land, economic, and united front issues that the Party needed to solve when the war turned to the offensive, Comrade Mao Zedong gave profound explanations. In view of the fact that the tendency to destroy industry and commerce had occurred in the land reform movement, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized in the report the new interpretation of the Party's economic program, that is, confiscating the land of the feudal class for the peasants, confiscating the bureaucratic capital for the new democratic state, protecting the national industry and commerce, and severely criticizing the erroneous policy of some Party cadres towards the middle and small bourgeoisie economic components. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the huge state economy with a socialist nature formed by the confiscation of bureaucratic capital would play a decisive and leading role in the economic life of the people's state, and therefore, the existence of middle and small bourgeoisie economic components was not only necessary but also not to be feared. Due to this meeting and the various works carried out by the Party during this period, the Party's subjective preparation for leading the people to win the victory of the whole country had also matured.

The war progressed rapidly in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, the people's liberation army had already mastered the tactics of attacking cities and successively captured a large number of "key defensive" cities of the Kuomintang. The Liao-Shen Campaign, which lasted from September 12 to November 2, 1948, after victory, the whole Northeast was liberated. This campaign annihilated 472,000 Kuomintang troops, making the people's liberation army also numerically surpass the Kuomintang army. Following this, in the south, the Huai-Hai Campaign, which lasted from November 7, 1948, to January 10, 1949, near Xuzhou, annihilated 555,000 Kuomintang troops, making the Kuomintang reactionaries lose their main military strength and exposing Nanjing to the attack of the people's liberation army. Almost at the same time, from December 5, 1948, to January 31, 1949, the people's liberation army also launched the campaign to liberate Tianjin and Beijing, capturing Zhangjiakou and Tianjin, making Beijing achieve a peaceful liberation, and making the Kuomintang army suffer a loss of 521,000 troops. In this way, the area north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River was basically liberated.

The war in the Third Revolutionary Civil War period and the establishment of the People's Republic of China

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the class relations in China underwent new changes.

The Kuomintang reactionaries, representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, had been passive in resisting Japan and active in opposing the Communists during the Anti-Japanese War, trying to weaken the strength of the Communist Party, preserve and accumulate their own strength, so that after relying on the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Chinese people represented by the Communist Party to defeat Japan, they could reap the benefits of the fisherman, and then launch an anti-Communist war, annihilate the Communist Party, and establish their dark dictatorship in the country. For this purpose, the Kuomintang reactionaries preserved all the weapons provided by foreign aid to the Kuomintang to resist Japan for use in the anti-Communist war. Therefore, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the crisis of civil war immediately threatened the people of the whole country. American imperialism, after Japan's surrender, tried to replace Japan in China, control the vast Chinese market, and turn China into an American colony. For this purpose, the United States had to aid the Kuomintang to annihilate the Communist Party because the Communist Party was the biggest obstacle to the United States achieving this goal. The Kuomintang also had to rely on American aid to carry out the anti-Communist civil war. American imperialism and the Kuomintang joined forces on this basis, actively preparing to launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas. They believed that relying on the numerical and equipment superiority of the Kuomintang army over the people's liberation army, relying on the superiority of the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the liberated areas in population and resources, and relying on the political, economic, and military support of the American government for the Kuomintang government, they could achieve this evil and shameful goal.

The anti-people war was a profitable business for the big bourgeoisie, that is, the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalist group. Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu, the four big families, after Japan's surrender, had already used the name of "receiving" to carry out unprecedented annexation and plunder, and the inflation and various taxes, bonds, economic controls implemented under the pretext of war made them able to plunder the blood and sweat of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas on a large scale, so that their wealth quickly accumulated to as much as 200 million US dollars.

The policy of the Kuomintang in the Anti-Japanese War had already made its contradictions with the working class, peasant class, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie in the country extremely sharp. After experiencing many years of war, all classes of people in the country universally demanded peace to restore the severely damaged production. The people demanded national independence and political democracy after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The peasants demanded land. However, the Kuomintang not only did not give them all this, but also decided to throw them back into the abyss of civil war and bankruptcy. The Kuomintang, in order to obtain American aid, gave various privileges to the United States, making the national industry and commerce in the Kuomintang-controlled areas suffer double oppression from American capital and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, and they closed down one after another, with workers losing their jobs in large numbers. The American military and other personnel in China gave various insults and harm to the Chinese people. The Kuomintang's secret police continued to use terrorist methods to persecute the people and democratic personages. The Kuomintang government in the Kuomintang-controlled areas gave the peasants forced conscription and forced grain procurement, and in the liberated areas, it organized landlords to seize the land that the peasants had already obtained.

The civil war decided by the Kuomintang reactionaries was inevitable, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were so isolated among the people, but the people who demanded peace still hoped to avoid war at all costs before the civil war broke out completely, and did not want to break with the Kuomintang.

However, in order to save peace at the last moment and to fully educate the people, the Communist Party of China, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, still made great efforts and patience to lead the people of the whole country to seek a way to avoid war and achieve peace and unity.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a "Declaration on the Current Situation" on August 25, 1945, expressing the Communist Party of China's desire for peace, democracy, and unity. To realize this desire, Comrade Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing on August 28 to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang for more than a month, and finally published the results of the negotiation on October 10, which included many agreements on guaranteeing domestic peace. The Communist Party of China was prepared to faithfully implement the agreements it had agreed to and had already begun to implement them, but on the part of Chiang Kai-shek, these agreements were only seen as a cover for launching a war. Chiang Kai-shek thought that after the agreement was reached, the vigilance of the Communist Party would inevitably be relaxed, and he would seize the opportunity to attack and would certainly achieve great victory. Therefore, after the agreement was published, Chiang Kai-shek immediately launched an attack on the liberated areas. However, the Communist Party of China was already on guard, and Chiang Kai-shek's military attack was smashed.

However, the war had not yet fully broken out. Because Chiang Kai-shek's troops that had avoided the Anti-Japanese War were still in the distant southwest and northwest, while the people's liberation army that had been on the front line of the Anti-Japanese War was in North China, East China, and Northeast China, this situation made it temporarily unfavorable for Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters to launch a full-scale civil war. At that time, they still needed to quickly "receive" the enemy-occupied cities and transportation lines and transport hundreds of thousands of troops to the front line to launch a civil war, and these things Chiang Kai-shek could not do alone. To do these things, American imperialism gave Chiang Kai-shek the greatest help. The American army landed in China's coastal areas, accepted Japan's surrender, prevented the liberation army from accepting the surrender, and handed over all the weapons of the Japanese army to Chiang Kai-shek. The American air force and navy also transported hundreds of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's troops to the outskirts of the liberated areas to launch an attack on the liberated areas. To do these things well, they needed time. To gain this time, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to accept the demand of the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, and the people of the whole country to announce a ceasefire on January 10, 1946, and immediately convened a political consultation conference including various parties. The American government also advocated a ceasefire at that time. The United States had signed the Moscow Declaration of the Three Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain on December 27, 1945, which expressed the hope that China would maintain peace and guarantee not to interfere in China's internal affairs. The American government sent Marshall to replace Hurley to continue to "mediate" the civil war in China. However, in fact, Marshall's task was only to help Chiang Kai-shek speed up the preparation for war. After everything was ready, Chiang Kai-shek first attacked the people's liberation army that had entered Northeast China before and after Japan's surrender, occupying a large area south of the Changchun-Jilin line to Anshan and west to Chengde. Subsequently, from July 1946, Chiang Kai-shek completely tore up the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the political consultation conference, commanding his entire forces to launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas, continuously occupying many cities and vast rural areas in the liberated areas.

During this period, the Communist Party of China carried out extensive and effective education for the people of the whole country, making the people of the whole country gradually wake up from the illusion of peace and the illusion of Chiang Kai-shek and the American government, and realize that to achieve peace, democracy, and independence, and to survive, they had to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and drive out American imperialism. The Communist Party of China, on the one hand, fully isolated American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek politically, and on the other hand, led the people's liberation army to make serious efforts to smash Chiang Kai-shek's attack. The Communist Party of China believed that Chiang Kai-shek's attack not only had to be defeated but also could be defeated. This was because the enemy's military superiority and American aid could only play a temporary role, while the justice or injustice of the war, the support of the people, could play a constant role, and in this regard, due to the correct efforts of the Communist Party of China for domestic peace, the advantage was definitely on the side of the people's liberation army.

To defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attack, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a resolute policy in the military field, that is, to take the annihilation of the enemy's effective forces as the main target, not to take the defense of cities or places as the main target; and to annihilate the enemy, every battle must be prepared, must be confident, and must concentrate absolute superiority of forces several times greater than the enemy to surround the enemy and annihilate the enemy, avoiding unprepared and unconfident battles. Under this policy, although the people's liberation army retreated from many cities and places in the early stage of the war, it annihilated a large number of Kuomintang troops, averaging about eight brigades and divisions of Kuomintang troops per month, using the captured equipment of the Kuomintang army to arm itself, and using the captured soldiers to reform and supplement itself. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek's full-scale attack, after suffering heavy losses for eight months, had to change the full-scale attack on the liberated areas to a "focused attack" in two areas, that is, taking Shandong and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia as the focus of the attack. However, the people's liberation army again seriously fought and smashed Chiang Kai-shek's "focused attack" on Shandong and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and at the same time, in Northeast China, Jin-Cha-Ji, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, and other areas, successively launched counterattacks. Therefore, by July 1947, the people's liberation army was able to launch a counterattack first in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield, advancing south of the Yellow River to the north bank of the Yangtze River. Following this, the people's liberation army also launched a large-scale offensive in Northeast China and other battlefields, fundamentally changing the situation of all battlefields. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek's attack was completely broken after a little more than a year.

American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek were intoxicated by the superficial victory in the early stage of the war, rejecting all peace proposals of the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole country, resulting in their own military and political dead ends. On October 11, 1946, the Kuomintang army occupied the main city of the North China liberated area, Zhangjiakou. On the same afternoon, Chiang Kai-shek violated the resolutions of the political consultation conference and ordered the convening of a split and dictatorial fake "National Assembly." On November 15, this fake "National Assembly" opened under the support of the American envoy Marshall and the American ambassador Stuart, and passed the fake "Constitution." However, it was proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's prediction in "On the Coalition Government" was correct, and this step of Chiang Kai-shek was only "putting a noose around his own neck" and did not receive any support from the people. In March 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries ordered the Communist Party personnel in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to withdraw to Yan'an, and then sent troops to attack and occupy Yan'an. From then on, any hope of a peaceful settlement was eliminated. However, all this only made the people, including the national bourgeoisie, concentrate their sympathy and hope on the Communist Party of China. The propaganda of the "third way" representing the right-wing of the national bourgeoisie also collapsed. The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the Democratic Construction Association, and other democratic parties and a large number of social personages all refused to cooperate with the Kuomintang reactionaries and refused to participate in the fake National Assembly and the reactionary government. At the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, students across the country held demonstrations against the American military's rape of Chinese female students. In May 1947, students across the country again held demonstrations against hunger, against civil war, and against oppression. Workers and peasants in various places also carried out many struggles against the Kuomintang. All this showed that American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries had been completely isolated, while the united front of the new democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China had been more expanded and consolidated than ever before. The conditions for the victory of the Chinese people in the country, both militarily and politically, had already matured.

On October 10, 1947, the people's liberation army issued a declaration calling on the people of the whole country to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and build a new China. To meet the long-standing demand of the peasants for land, the Communist Party of China on the same day promulgated the Land Law Outline, announcing the abolition of the feudal land system and the implementation of the land system of "the land belongs to the tiller." The land reform mobilized the peasants in the liberated areas to the fullest extent, eliminated the landlord class in the liberated areas, and greatly consolidated the liberated areas, aiding the people's liberation war. At the same time, to implement the land reform, strengthen the combat effectiveness of the people's liberation army, and strengthen the democratization of the countryside, the Communist Party of China led the whole Party to carry out a rectification movement to raise the class consciousness of the people's liberation army, overcome the phenomenon of impure composition and impure style in the countryside Party, and prepare for new victories. To prepare for new victories, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia in December 1947, where Comrade Mao Zedong made a report on "The Current Situation and Our Tasks." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the Chinese people's revolutionary war had reached a turning point, and this turning point was also the turning point of "the imperialist rule in China from development to annihilation." Regarding the military, land, economic, and united front issues that the Party needed to solve when the war turned to the offensive, Comrade Mao Zedong gave profound explanations. In view of the fact that the tendency to destroy industry and commerce had occurred in the land reform movement, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized in the report the new interpretation of the Party's economic program, that is, confiscating the land of the feudal class for the peasants, confiscating the bureaucratic capital for the new democratic state, protecting the national industry and commerce, and severely criticizing the erroneous policy of some Party cadres towards the middle and small bourgeoisie economic components. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the huge state economy with a socialist nature formed by the confiscation of bureaucratic capital would play a decisive and leading role in the economic life of the people's state, and therefore, the existence of middle and small bourgeoisie economic components was not only necessary but also not to be feared. Due to this meeting and the various works carried out by the Party during this period, the Party's subjective preparation for leading the people to win the victory of the whole country had also matured.

The war progressed rapidly in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, the people's liberation army had already mastered the tactics of attacking cities and successively captured a large number of "key defensive" cities of the Kuomintang. The Liao-Shen Campaign, which lasted from September 12 to November 2, 1948, after victory, the whole Northeast was liberated. This campaign annihilated 472,000 Kuomintang troops, making the people's liberation army also numerically surpass the Kuomintang army. Following this, in the south, the Huai-Hai Campaign, which lasted from November 7, 1948, to January 10, 1949, near Xuzhou, annihilated 555,000 Kuomintang troops, making the Kuomintang reactionaries lose their main military strength and exposing Nanjing to the attack of the people's liberation army. Almost at the same time, from December 5, 1948, to January 31, 1949, the people's liberation army also launched the campaign to liberate Tianjin and Beijing, capturing Zhangjiakou and Tianjin, making Beijing achieve a peaceful liberation, and making the Kuomintang army suffer a loss of 521,000 troops. In this way, the area north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River was basically liberated.

The war in the Third Revolutionary Civil War period and the establishment of the People's Republic of China

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the class relations in China underwent new changes.

The Kuomintang reactionaries, representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, had been passive in resisting Japan and active in opposing the Communists during the Anti-Japanese War, trying to weaken the strength of the Communist Party, preserve and accumulate their own strength, so that after relying on the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Chinese people represented by the Communist Party to defeat Japan, they could reap the benefits of the fisherman, and then launch an anti-Communist war, annihilate the Communist Party, and establish their dark dictatorship in the country. For this purpose, the Kuomintang reactionaries preserved all the weapons provided by foreign aid to the Kuomintang to resist Japan for use in the anti-Communist war. Therefore, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the crisis of civil war immediately threatened the people of the whole country. American imperialism, after Japan's surrender, tried to replace Japan in China, control the vast Chinese market, and turn China into an American colony. For this purpose, the United States had to aid the Kuomintang to annihilate the Communist Party because the Communist Party was the biggest obstacle to the United States achieving this goal. The Kuomintang also had to rely on American aid to carry out the anti-Communist civil war. American imperialism and the Kuomintang joined forces on this basis, actively preparing to launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas. They believed that relying on the numerical and equipment superiority of the Kuomintang army over the people's liberation army, relying on the superiority of the Kuomintang-controlled areas over the liberated areas in population and resources, and relying on the political, economic, and military support of the American government for the Kuomintang government, they could achieve this evil and shameful goal.

The anti-people war was a profitable business for the big bourgeoisie, that is, the Kuomintang bureaucratic capitalist group. Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu, the four big families, after Japan's surrender, had already used the name of "receiving" to carry out unprecedented annexation and plunder, and the inflation and various taxes, bonds, economic controls implemented under the pretext of war made them able to plunder the blood and sweat of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas on a large scale, so that their wealth quickly accumulated to as much as 200 million US dollars.

The policy of the Kuomintang in the Anti-Japanese War had already made its contradictions with the working class, peasant class, urban petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie in the country extremely sharp. After experiencing many years of war, all classes of people in the country universally demanded peace to restore the severely damaged production. The people demanded national independence and political democracy after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. The peasants demanded land. However, the Kuomintang not only did not give them all this, but also decided to throw them back into the abyss of civil war and bankruptcy. The Kuomintang, in order to obtain American aid, gave various privileges to the United States, making the national industry and commerce in the Kuomintang-controlled areas suffer double oppression from American capital and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, and they closed down one after another, with workers losing their jobs in large numbers. The American military and other personnel in China gave various insults and harm to the Chinese people. The Kuomintang's secret police continued to use terrorist methods to persecute the people and democratic personages. The Kuomintang government in the Kuomintang-controlled areas gave the peasants forced conscription and forced grain procurement, and in the liberated areas, it organized landlords to seize the land that the peasants had already obtained.

The civil war decided by the Kuomintang reactionaries was inevitable, and the Kuomintang reactionaries were so isolated among the people, but the people who demanded peace still hoped to avoid war at all costs before the civil war broke out completely, and did not want to break with the Kuomintang. In the national bourgeoisie and its parties, there was still an illusion about the Kuomintang and the United States, and there was still an illusion of seeking a "third way" outside the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The Communist Party of China had long been aware of the Kuomintang and American imperialism's plot for civil war and had made full preparations in terms of thought and organization. However, in order to save peace at the last moment and to fully educate the people, the Communist Party of China, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, still made great efforts and patience to lead the people of the whole country to seek a way to avoid war and achieve peace and unity.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a "Declaration on the Current Situation" on August 25, 1945, expressing the Communist Party of China's desire for peace, democracy, and unity.

　　中国共产党的三十年（之二）
      胡乔木
    一九二八年七月党的第六次全国代表大会，与清算了陈独秀的投降主义同时，也批判了“左”倾盲动主义的错误。第六次大会确定了中国革命的性质仍然是民主革命，总的任务是建立反帝反封建的工农民主专政，并且规定了工农民主专政的各项纲领。大会提出了建立红军、建立农村革命根据地、实行分配土地的任务。大会指出了革命高潮不可避免，但又指出了当时的政治形势是在两个革命高潮之间，指出革命发展的不平衡，指出了党在当时的总任务不是进攻，不是组织起义，而是争取群众。这些都是第六次大会的功绩。第六次大会的缺点是对于民主革命的长期性，中间阶级的作用和反动势力的内部矛盾，缺少正确的估计；而对于党的策略上所需要的退却，特别是需要将党的工作的重点由敌人力量比较强大的城市转移到敌人力量比较薄弱的农村这个关键问题，也没有必要的认识。党的领导工作，仍然掌握在“左”倾分子手中。第六次大会的这些缺点，曾经妨碍了党内“左”倾错误的彻底纠正。
    毛泽东同志没有出席党的第六次大会。在第六次大会上，毛泽东同志被选为党的中央委员。
    第六次大会所没有正确解决的问题，随后就由毛泽东同志在实际上和理论上解决了。毛泽东同志在一九二七年十月率领新成立的一支工农革命军退到湖南江西两省交界的井岗山区城，在那里成立了湘赣边区工农政府，并且着手领导农民分配土地。随后，朱德、陈毅、林彪等同志又由广东率领南昌起义的一支部队，经过江西转入湖南南部，领导当地农民的革命游击战争，扩大了部队，并在一九二八年四月与井岗山的部队相会合，成立了中国工农红军第四军。在与敌人的斗争中进行了多次的胜利斗争，以及由彭德怀同志率领的在平江起义的部队前来会合以后，以井岗山为中心的革命根据地，逐步扩大和巩固了起来。在这个期间，党所领导的江西、湖南、湖北、广西等地农民游击战争和土地斗争，也有了发展，陆续成立了几支红军和几处革命根据地。一九二九年，毛泽东同志和朱德同志所领导的红军向江西南部和福建西部进发，并以江西瑞金为中心建立了中央革命根据地。
    毛泽东同志在一九二七年冬天开始创建的革命根据地和他所领导进行的革命战争，以及其他同志在其他地区创建的革命根据地和他们所领导进行的革命战争，成了新时期中国革命斗争的主要内容，成了全国政治生活中的重要势力，成了蒋介石反革命统治的最大威胁和全国劳动人民的最大希望。
    红军战争和农村革命根据地为什么是可能的呢？为什么是当时中国革命斗争的主要内容呢？毛泽东同志在一九二八年十月所写的《中国红色政权为什么能够存在？》和一九三○年一月所写的《星星之火，可以燎原》两篇论文中，给了理论上的答复。在第一篇论文中，毛泽东同志指出：当时红色政权能够存在的主要条件是五个：第一，中国的特点，即地方性的农业经济和帝国主义势力范围的分裂剥削政策，这造成了反动统治的缝隙，给革命力量以可乘之机；第二，第一次国内革命战争影响的遗留；第三，全国革命形势的继续向前发展；第四，红军的存在；第五，共产党组织的有力量和它的政策的正确。在第二篇论文里，毛泽东同志详细地估计了中国红军战争的意义。毛泽东同志指出：红军战争和革命根据地的发展，是“半殖民地农民斗争的最高形式，也就是半殖民地农民斗争必然走向的形式”，是“半殖民地无产阶级斗争最重要的同盟力量”和“促进全国革命高潮的重要因素”。毛泽东同志认定：必须放手发展红军战争、发展土地革命和建立革命政权，“必须这样，才能树立全国革命群众的信仰，如苏联之于全世界然；必须这样，才能给统治阶级以甚大之困难，动摇其基础而促进其内部的分解；也必须这样，才能真正地创造红军，成为将来大革命的重要工具之一。总而言之，必须这样，才能促进革命的高潮。”这样，毛泽东同志就找出了中国革命在城市中被强大的敌人击败，暂时无法在城市中取得胜利的条件下唯一正确的发展规律，即以武装革命的农村包围并且最后夺取反革命占据的城市。中国革命在后来二十年间的发展，完全证实了毛泽东同志的这个预见。
    在这个期间，毛泽东同志不但制定了党在第二次国内革命战争时期革命发展的总轨道，而且在各项具体政策方面，例如在土地革命的政策方面，在对待中间阶级的政策方面，在战胜优势敌人的军事战略战术和部队工作方面，在农村环境和军事环境下的党的建设工作方面，都作了重要的创造。鉴于贫农和雇农是农村中最革命的力量，中农是坚决拥护革命的重要力量，富农的经济在资产阶级民主革命阶段中仍然需要保存，中小工商业在资产阶级民主革命阶段中需要保护和发展，因此，毛泽东同志正确地规定了和坚决地实行了依靠贫农雇农，联合中农，保护富农，保护中小工商业者，而仅仅消灭地主阶级的土地革命路线。鉴于战争和军队是中国革命的主要斗争形式和组织形式，又鉴于当时的革命战争的特点是敌强我弱，敌大我小，和敌之脱离群众我之联系群众，因此，毛泽东同志正确地规定了红军必须是党、人民政权、土地改革和其他一切地方工作的宣传者和组织者，规定了红军必须在部队中建立强大的政治工作和严格的群众纪律，规定了红军必须实行依靠群众的人民战争，以游击战和带游击性的运动战作为当时的主要战争形式，规定了红军必须实行战略的持久战和战役的速决战，平时分兵以发动群众，战时集中优势兵力，以包围迂回和歼灭敌人，而这些基本原则和其他军事原则就构成了中国革命战争的军事路线。由于这一切，可以说，毛泽东同志在这个中国革命困难时期的工作，已经奠定了领导中国革命走向胜利的主要基础。
    到一九三○年，全国红军已发展到约六万人，江西中央区的红军已有三万几千人。在一九三○年和稍后的时期，革命根据地的范围已发展到福建、安徽、河南、陕西、甘肃等省和广东的海南岛。红军的迅速发展引起蒋介石的极大的震动。一九三○年底，蒋介石派了七个师共约十万人围攻中央区红军，结果被红军消灭一个整师和另半个师，蒋军前敌总指挥被俘。在红军胜利的影响下，一九三一年二月，进攻红军的国民党第二十六路军一万余人，在赵博生、董振堂等同志领导下，在江西宁都起义加入了红军。一九三一年五月，蒋介石又派兵二十万人由何应钦为总司令向中央红军举行第二次围攻，结果又被粉碎，被俘三万多人，缴枪二万多枝。同年七月，蒋介石又发起第三次围攻，自任总司令，随带英日德军事顾问，率兵三十万人，分三路深入中央红军根据地，但是结果仍然被粉碎。与此同时，在徐向前同志领导之下的先在鄂豫皖根据地后来转移到川北根据地的红军，和在贺龙同志领导之下的湘鄂西根据地的红军，也取得了许多重要的胜利。经过这些胜利，红军的力量就继续发展，而新的革命形势，也就逐渐地接近于成熟了。
    正在这时，发生了一九三一年九月十八日开始的日本帝国主义对于中国东北的大举进攻。从一八九四年中日战争起就决心侵略中国的日本帝国主义者，看到一九二九年底资本主义世界经济恐慌以来英美等国忙于内部事务，无暇与日本争夺中国，又看到蒋介石政府完全投降帝国主义，并依赖英美帝国主义的援助去进行反革命内部的内战和反对工农红军的内战，不敢抵抗日本对于中国的侵略，因此就决定首先侵略东北，然后逐步向中国本部扩张其侵略。日本在一九三一年内迅速占领东北全境，并在一九三二年一月进入上海，一九三三年占领热河和察哈尔的北部，一九三五年占领河北的东部。
    日本帝国主义的进攻根本改变了中国的政治状况。抵抗日本的进攻成为全国人民紧急的任务和普遍的要求。工人、农民、学生的抗日运动在全国各地高涨起来。在一九二七年退出革命的上层小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，这时也改变了他们的政治态度，开始在政治上活跃起来，要求蒋介石政府改变政策。蒋介石政府则坚持他的对日不抵抗、对内加紧“剿共”、加紧法西斯恐怖的政策。但是甚至在国民党和国民党军队中间，也开始发生了政治上的分化。一九三二年一月国民党的第十九路军在上海人民反日运动的影响下，向进攻上海的日本军进行了英勇的抵抗；一九三三年十一月，这个军队的领导者及其他一些国民党人又在福建成立反蒋联共的人民政府。冯玉祥在一九三三年五月也与共产党人合作在察哈尔的张家口组织民众抗日同盟军。
    在日本进攻面前，中国共产党首先主张武装抵抗，并且领导了或积极参加了全国人民的抗日运动和东北人民的抗日游击战争。一九三三年一月，中国工农红军宣言愿在停止进攻红军、保证人民民主权利和武装民众的三个条件下与全国各军队停战议和，以便共同抗日。但是虽然如此，党的领导在一九三一年至一九三四年间却因为陷入了新的严重的“左”倾错误，以至不但没有能够在日本进攻、红军胜利、人民抗日反蒋的有利形势下将革命推向前进，反而使革命受到了新的挫折。
    虽有第一次国内革命战争失败及其以后种种事变的教训，在党的第六次大会以后，党的领导机关仍然设在反革命中心的上海，党的领导仍然没有以红军战争为中心，仍然没有以毛泽东同志为中心。抱着小资产阶级急躁情绪、不了解红军战争的意义和规律、幻想着在反革命白色恐怖下举行城市起义的“左”倾机会主义分子，继续占据着党中央的领导地位。在一九三○年六月至十月间，党中央以李立三同志为首，曾经要求组织全国中心城市的总起义和全国红军向中心城市的总进攻。这个错误计划曾经引起国民党统治区党的秘密组织的严重损失，但是在红军中却因受到了以毛泽东同志为首的坚决抵抗，没有发生大的影响。一九三○年十月，李立三同志的错误受到了党的六届三中全会的纠正。但在一九三一年一月，以陈绍禹（王明）、秦邦宪（博古）两同志为首的以教条主义为特征的一个新的“左”倾派别，又利用马克思主义“理论”的外衣，起来攻击三中全会没有纠正“立三路线”的“右倾”，并经过党的六届四中全会而取得了中央的领导地位。以王明、博古为首的新的“左”倾派别，完全否认由日本侵略所引起的国内政治的重大变化，认为国民党各派和各中间派别都是一样的反革命，他们对于中国革命的进攻都是一致的，要求党向他们一律进行“决死斗争”。这个“左”倾派别在红军战争的问题上反对毛泽东同志关于游击战运动战的思想，继续要求红军夺取中心城市；又在国民党区城市工作的问题上，反对刘少奇同志所坚持的关于利用合法、积蓄力量的思想，继续实行脱离多数群众的冒险政策。在这个错误的领导下，党在国民党统治区的组织差不多是全部受到了破坏，由“左”倾分子所组织的临时中央也在一九三三年搬入中央红军根据地。临时中央到达红军根据地后，虽然已与在红军中及革命根据地工作的中央委员如毛泽东同志等相汇合，组成了正式的中央机关，但是排挤了毛泽东同志的领导，特别是毛泽东同志对于红军的领导。这样，由红军胜利和国民党统治区群众运动高涨所表现出来的革命的复兴，就被破坏了。
    在一九三二年六月到一九三三年二月，刚刚出卖了上海抗日战争的蒋介石，又以九十个师五十万兵力组织了对中国工农红军的第四次全面围攻。根据毛泽东同志的战略，红军在这次反围攻的战争中又得到了巨大的胜利。但在一九三三年十月，蒋介石又以一百万兵力，举行对红军的第五次围攻，并以五十万兵力进攻中央红军。在这次战役中，红军因为党的中央实行了完全错误的单纯防御的军事路线和其他错误政策，没有能击破敌人的围攻。一九三四年十月，中央红军退出江西根据地，进行了世界历史上前所未有的长征。在此期间，全国其他的革命根据地和红军，也遭受了“左”倾分子同样的损害。各地红军，除刘志丹、高岗等同志所领导的陕甘红军外，都先后退出了原来的根据地，进行了长征。
    在中央红军长征中，党的中央在军事上继续发生错误，使在敌人前堵后追中的红军数次陷入危险境地并受到极大的损失。为了挽救在危险中的红军和中国革命事业，党在一九三五年一月，由于毛泽东同志及其他同志坚决的斗争，在贵州遵义举行了党的中央政治局扩大会议。在多数同志的觉悟和拥护之下，遵义会议撤换了“左”倾机会主义分子的领导，确立了毛泽东同志在中央和全党的领导地位。从此以后，中国共产党和中国革命，就一直在这位杰出的伟大的完全可以信赖的领袖的马克思列宁主义的领导之下，而这就使革命的胜利得到最重要的保证。
    一九三五年十月，即在长征开始的一年以后，中央红军终于以超乎寻常的毅力，战胜了军事上的、政治上的和自然界的无数艰险，经历了二万五千华里的征途，越过了人迹罕到的雪山草地，达到陕西北部，与陕甘红军部队相会合。任弼时、贺龙两同志所领导的红军，和徐向前同志所领导的红军，也在一九三六年十月与中央红军在陕甘地区相会合。在徐向前同志所领导的红军中工作的张国焘，由于对革命前途丧失信心，曾经进行分裂和背叛党的活动，拒绝与中央红军一同由川西北北上，反而强迫部队向西康方面退缩，并非法地组织了在张国焘领导之下的另一个中央。由于毛泽东同志所采取的党内斗争的正确方针，由于朱德、任弼时、贺龙、关向应等同志的坚忍努力，叛徒张国焘的分裂阴谋很快地就完全失败了，但是红军却因此受到了另一次很大的损失。在国民党第五次围攻以前，红军曾发展到三十万人，但是由于党内错误的领导，受到了许多的挫折，经过长征，到陕北会合之后，总共已不到三万人。但这是红军和党的极可宝贵的精华。
    中国工农红军长征的胜利，是中国革命转危为安的关键。它使全国人民对于革命前途和抗日救国运动的前途有了希望。它使全中国全世界相信了中国共产党和中国红军是不可战胜的力量，相信了为着战胜当时在中国得寸进尺的日本帝国主义，非要依靠中国共产党不可，非要停止反共的内战不可。
    一九三五年十一月，中央红军、陕北红军和由鄂豫皖、湘鄂边北上经过长征的红军紧接在会合以后，就共同地粉碎了国民党军对陕甘革命根据地的三次围攻，大大地巩固了陕甘革命根据地，扩大了红军的声势。随后，由于日本帝国主义进一步向华北的进攻，由北京学生在十二月九日举行的抗日救国大示威而开始的“一二九”运动，在全国发展起来了，广大的人民在运动中一致地提出了党所拟定的“停止内战、一致抗日”的口号。革命从新走向高潮。在这个时候，需要对日本进攻中国以来的国内形势作一次正确的分析，决定党的政策，纠正在党内浓厚存在着的“左”倾关门主义。这个工作，是一九三一年到一九三四年的党中央所不能完成，毛泽东同志在一九三五年的长征中也不可能完成的。在一九三五年八月共产国际第七次大会所决定的关于反法西斯统一战线的正确政策的帮助之下，党在八月一日所发表的号召统一战线的宣言，特别是党中央政治局十二月二十五日在陕北的会议所通过的决议，以及毛泽东同志在十二月二十七日党的活动分子会议上所作的报告“论反对日本帝国主义的策略”，满足了这个要求。
    毛泽东同志的报告有系统地提出了建立抗日民族统一战线问题。毛泽东同志在指出了民族资产阶级的左翼可能参加抗日斗争而其他部分可能由动摇而中立，指出了国民党营垒可能破裂和其中英美买办集团在一定条件下可能转而被迫参加抗日，指出了长征的伟大意义以后，总结党的任务说：“党的任务，就是把红军的活动和全国的工人、农民、学生、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级的一切活动汇合起来，成为一个统一的民族革命战线。”毛泽东同志痛驳了党内“左”倾分子提出来的反对统一战线的一切论据。毛泽东同志提出了人民共和国的口号以代替工农共和国的口号，并且规定了在政治上经济上对待民族资产阶级的正确政策。毛泽东同志指出：人民共和国在资产阶级民主革命时期，对于不赞助帝国主义及其走狗的民族资本家和他们所经营的工商业是保护的，它以工人农民为主体，但又代表着反帝反封建的各层人民的利益。毛泽东同志指出：这个统一战线与一九二四年到一九二七年的统一战线的区别，是在有无坚强的共产党和革命军队参加。毛泽东同志在比较两个时期的不同时说：“在今天，这件事起了变化了，坚强的共产党和坚强的红军都已经有了，而且有了红军的根据地。他们不但充当着抗日民族统一战线的发起人，而且在将来的抗日政府和抗日军队中必然要成为坚强的台柱子，使日本人和蒋介石对于抗日民族统一战线所使用的拆台政策，或失败主义，不能达到最后的目的。”这样，毛泽东同志的这个报告就不但规定了当时党的政策，预见了中国政治的后来的发展，而且总结了两次国内革命战争时期的根本经验，规定了党在民主革命时期的根本路线。
    中共中央的正确的政治路线，迅速地收到了巨大的效果，并迅速地促成了抗日战争的实现。红军在一九三六年二月东征进入山西，在取得许多胜利以后，在五月间，向国民党发出停战议和一致抗日的通电，并与陕西的张学良杨虎城等首先实现了停战。国民党统治区的党的工作和各界人民的抗日救亡运动，在刘少奇同志正确指导下，也得到了恢复和发展。但是蒋介石仍然坚持反对中国共产党和中国人民的反动政策，继续向红军进攻。一九三六年十二月十二日要求联共抗日的张学良杨虎城，在西安扣留了蒋介石，迫使他停止亡国的反共内战。中国共产党认为在当时的条件下，为了抵抗日本帝国主义的侵略，应使西安事变和平解决，因此蒋介石被释放了，国内和平乃得实现。为了便于保持国内和平，并为了争取地主阶级共同抗日，党在西安事变和平解决后决定暂时停止没收分配地主土地的政策。由于国内和平实现，在一九三七年七月七日日本帝国主义借口芦沟桥事变对中国实行新的进攻时，中国军队包括蒋介石的军队在内对于日本的进攻就实行了抵抗，全国规模的抗日战争就爆发了。由于中国共产党在西安事变中及其以后的各项正确的主张和努力，促成了国内和平和抗日战争的实现，就极大地提高了党在全国人民群众中的威信。
    一九三七年五月，党中央召集了党的全国代表会议，这个会议讨论和批准了党在一九三五年以来的政治路线，并为抗日战争作了政治上和组织上的准备工作。
    在革命脱离了危险而走向新的高涨的年份，为了总结经验，训练干部，毛泽东同志曾以极大的努力从事理论工作。在一九三六年秋，毛泽东同志写了关于《中国革命战争的战略问题》一书，总结了一九二七年至一九三六年的革命战争的经验，阐明了中国革命战争的特点，有系统地批判了“左”倾分子和右倾分子的军事路线的错误。这是世界共产主义运动中最优秀的马克思主义的军事著作之一。但是这部书的意义远超于单纯的军事问题以外。它实际上是深刻地分析了中国革命本身的规律。并且，由于它对于战争的胜利和失败的根源，对于战争规律的认识过程和学习过程，以及战争的各种辩证规律，都作了根本性质的解剖，它就成了一部重要的马克思主义的哲学著作。在一九三七年夏，毛泽东同志又写了他的著名的哲学的著作《实践论》。毛泽东同志在这部著作中全面地、深刻地而又通俗地解说了马克思列宁主义的认识论。毛泽东同志这部著作在中国思想史和党的思想工作上有极重要的价值。它是教育人们如何正确地思想、正确地行动和正确地学习的最好的教科书。它分析了第二次国内革命战争时期党内争论的哲学性质，根据无可辩驳的唯物论原理，揭露了“左”倾分子和右倾分子在认识方法上的教条主义错误和经验主义错误。毛泽东同志的这一著作，不但奠定了中国共产党的马克思列宁主义教育的基础，而且对于世界马克思列宁主义的哲学宝库，也作了光辉的贡献。
    第二次国内革命战争时期，是党在极端困难条件下达到政治上的成熟和推动革命的新高涨的时期。在这个时期，主要地依靠毛泽东同志的努力，党深刻地认识了军事工作和农村工作的重要性，创造了革命军队和农村革命根据地，学会了领导革命战争、土地改革和各种政权工作。在这个时期，党认识了自己的真正的马克思列宁主义的领导者毛泽东同志，同时也认识了各种“左”倾的小资产阶级思想的危害，并在与各种错误的小资产阶级思想的斗争中，建立了以毛泽东同志为首的党的领导。与第一次国内革命战争时期在国共合作中的右倾是主要的危害相反，在这个时期党的领导机关所犯的主要错误是“左”倾；“左”倾的错误曾使党和红军遭遇了严重的挫折，因而推迟了革命的新的高涨。但是无论如何，经过了各种艰难曲折锻炼出来并取得了丰富经验的党和军队，却构成了后来领导抗日战争和人民解放战争的主干。由于上述一切，可以说，第二次国内革命战争对于中国革命的今天的胜利，是完成了最重要的政治准备和干部准备。
    从一九二七年到一九三七年，党渡过了极端严重的反动时期。在这个时期内，一方面，敌人企图完全消灭我们党，我们党和敌人进行了极端艰苦、复杂和英勇的斗争；另一方面，党在克服了右倾的陈独秀机会主义之后，又受到“左”倾机会主义的几次侵袭，使党处于极端的危险之中。但是由于毛泽东同志的创造性的马克思列宁主义的正确领导，和他的异于寻常的忍耐性与遵守纪律的精神，充分圆满地克服了党内机会主义的错误，把党从极端危险的情况中挽救出来。这样，就使党在渡过了十年的反动时期以后，在内外敌人的侵袭和打击之下，在全国范围内用革命精神教育了广大的人民群众，在人民群众中保存了党的革命旗帜，并保存了红军的基干和一部分革命根据地，保存了党的大批的优秀干部和数万党员，积蓄了大量的革命经验，特别是关于战争和革命根据地的经验，用以迎接新的革命高潮——全国规模的抗日爱国战争和新的国共合作。
        三  抗日战争时期
    一九三七年七月七日，日本侵略军向驻防北京以南的芦沟桥地方的中国守军发起攻击，中国守军奋起抵抗。八月十三日，日本军又攻击上海，上海守军亦进行抗击。全国进入了抗日战争。经过与国民党政府的协议，中国红军及其在南方各省所留下的游击队，先后改编为八路军和新四军，开向华北和华东前线参加抗日战争。
    在当时，围绕着抗日战争的基本政治情况如下：
    在国际方面，存在着日本、苏联、英美三种不同的力量。第一种力量：日本。日本帝国主义是凶恶的侵略者。日本所实行的灭亡全中国的方针，引起了中国全体爱国人民的反抗。日本不但侵略中国，并且向苏联一再挑战，企图在苏联没有准备的条件下袭击苏联，同时用这种姿态来引诱执行反苏政策的英美帝国主义分子对于它的让步。日本对中国的侵略夺取了英美在中国的帝国主义利益，威胁了英美在整个东南亚和太平洋的帝国主义利益，因此日本与英美之间有矛盾。至于日本人民的革命势力，在战争中是反对日本帝国主义而援助中国人民的，但是力量太小，还不能发生严重的影响。第二种力量：苏联。苏联坚决地执行着支援中国抗日战争的政策，所以在一九三七年八月与中国订立互不侵犯条约，并且给中国以财政上军事上的援助。苏联又坚决地执行着和平政策，警惕地不陷入英美帝国主义坐山观虎斗的圈套。但是在一九四五年消灭了希特勒德国以后，苏联就迅速向日本宣战。事实证明苏联的政策是完全正确的，既合于苏联的利益，也合于中国人民和世界人民的利益。第三种力量：英美。英美在此时既不同于日本，更不同于苏联。英美帝国主义不愿意日本夺取它们在东方的利益。但是它们一则希望把战争引向苏联以便自己坐山观虎斗；二则害怕中国人民力量的兴起，危害它们的利益；三则忙于应付西方由希特勒所引起的紧张局势，力求缓和日本在东方对于它们的矛盾，害怕日本在东方对于它们的攻击。所以直到日本在一九四一年发起攻击英美的时候，它们总是竭力与日本寻求妥协，或则希望日本和中国两败俱伤。在太平洋战争爆发特别是美国在太平洋上转入优势以后，美国是要求中国积极反攻日本了，但是美帝国主义的计划，却是利用这种情势来独占中国，排挤中国人民的革命势力，以便变中国为美国的殖民地。英美帝国主义者的反革命的两面政策，需要中国人民在其反对日本侵略的时候与之联合，同时又须警惕和反对他们的危害中国人民的阴谋。
    在国内方面，存在着人民、国民党和汉奸三种不同的力量。人民是坚决反对日本的。工人阶级和农民阶级是抗日战争的领导者和主力。在日本灭亡全中国的政策之下，不但民族资产阶级和城市小资产阶级都站在抗日方面，地主阶级中的若干人特别是由地主阶级分化出来的开明绅士，也站到抗日方面来了。因此，人民的抗日统一战线，极为广大。汉奸是坚决依附日本，帮助日本侵略中国，压迫中国人民的。日本曾经用很大的力量收买中国最反动的一部分大地主大资产阶级和其他败类充当汉奸，而国民党的长期反动政策也帮助了汉奸的产生，国民党内的汪精卫一派就在抗日战争爆发后不久投到日本方面去了。但是汉奸究竟为数很少，全国人民对于汉奸也是一致反对，连国民党反动派也不能不在口头上加以反对。问题是在国民党方面。国民党的主体，代表大地主、大资产阶级的蒋介石集团，基本上是英美买办集团，曾经在多年的反动中坚决地反对人民，反对抗日，并且一心一意地要消灭共产党。蒋介石这时起来抗日，第一是由于人民对他的压迫，使他不能不起来抗日，否则全国人民和许多有组织的抗日力量都将自动起来抗日，他就不能维持自己的统治；第二是由于日本帝国主义对于全国的进攻直接地危害着他的政权和地主资产阶级的财产，他和日本帝国主义的矛盾此时已无法调和；第三是由于英美帝国主义与日本帝国主义的矛盾。英美自己不愿得罪日本，但愿中国和日本打着，拖住日本。由于这些原因，所以蒋介石集团在抗日战争中就表现他具有互相矛盾的反革命的两面性：一方面，他要抗日，也要其他势力积极抗日，在战争初期也曾表现了他的某种程度的抗日积极性，并希望能够速胜；另一方面，他又反对人民，继续压迫人民，不愿人民起来抗日，特别不愿共产党和其他抗日势力动员人民起来抗日。他要包办抗日的领导，但他拒绝实行任何真正的民主改革，极力限制人民力量的发展，特别限制共产党力量的发展。他曾阴谋地计算在抗日战争中假手日本军阀来消灭八路军、新四军及其他抗日势力，而保存他自己的力量。为了这种目的，他指挥八路军、新四军去担负最前线和敌人后方最严重的作战任务。他不相信倚靠中国的力量能使抗日胜利，因而他不倚靠而且不愿意倚靠中国人民自己的力量，而把希望寄托在国外的援助上。他希望很快地引起英美对于日本的干涉，由英美代他抗日，在后来尤其希望美国。但是后来的事实是，英美的干涉迟迟不来，英美并和日本不断地妥协；八路军、新四军进入敌后不但没有被日军消灭，反而和敌后广大的人民结合，取得不断的胜利，有了极大的发展；全国人民抗日的力量大大地冲破了他所允许和限制的范围以外，有了很大的发展；而他自己的军队则在抗战中大部被击溃并受了很大的损失，他的威信迅速低落。这些都不能不引起他的失望和恐惧。从此以后，他就实行消极抗日，积极反共反人民，避战观战，保存力量，聚积力量，以待其他抗日力量战胜日本后，坐收渔人之利，然后以保存和聚积起来的力量消灭共产党和人民力量。这就是蒋介石集团在抗日战争中的基本立场和政策。美国帝国主义除对蒋介石消极抗战一点有所不满以外，在实际上是完全赞成蒋介石这种立场和政策的，所以无论美国舆论曾经怎样不满蒋介石，美国政府却在抗日战争末期用一切方法援助蒋介石。这样，蒋介石就既不同于汉奸，又不同于抗日的人民。抗日的人民要求团结全国一切可以团结的力量首先是动员人民群众的力量来进行抗日战争，因此，既需要与蒋介石进行一定的联合，以便推动蒋介石部下的军队抗日，又需要与蒋介石的反动政策进行坚决的斗争，以便保卫人民力量，把人民群众的力量动员起来争取胜利，不为蒋介石及其主人美帝国主义的阴谋所削弱和压倒，而能压倒蒋介石及其主人美帝国主义的阴谋。因此，显而易见，代表抗日人民利益的中国共产党，在与国民党建立统一战线的时候，不能不警惕地坚持统一战线中的独立自主的原则。
    毛泽东同志正确地估计了抗日战争中的复杂的政治情势。在抗日战争爆发以后，毛泽东同志就指出：共产党与国民党的争论，无产阶级与参加抗战的大地主大资产阶级（蒋介石集团）的争论，已经不是应否抗战的问题，而是如何争取胜利的问题了。毛泽东同志指出：抗日战争中存在着两条相反的路线，即以蒋介石为代表的大地主大资产阶级的路线，和以共产党为代表的无产阶级和全国人民的路线；实行蒋介石国民党的不要全国人民抗战只要国民党政府抗战的“片面抗战”的路线，战争必然失败；只有实行人民战争的路线或“全面抗战”的路线，战争才能胜利。一九三七年八月，中国共产党中央在延安附近的洛川召集的会议中，根据毛泽东同志的提议，通过了著名的《抗日救国十大纲领》，作为党领导全国人民争取抗日战争胜利、反对蒋介石反动的两面政策的指针。洛川会议决定在敌人后方放手发动独立自主的游击战争，使游击战争担负配合正面战场、开辟敌后战场、建立敌后抗日根据地的战略任务，并决定在一切国民党统治区放手发动抗日的群众运动。洛川会议决定为抗日战争的利益所必要的人民民主民生权利而斗争，并决定以减租减息作为抗日战争时期解决农民问题的基本政策。
    抗日战争中的两条路线的争论，在党内也有了严重的反映。第二次国内革命战争时期曾经犯过严重的“左”倾错误的一些同志，以王明（陈绍禹）同志为代表，这时站在右倾机会主义的立场上来批评和反对党的路线，并且违反党的纪律，在他们所负责的工作中擅自执行了他们自己的右倾机会主义路线。他们看到了共产党及其军事力量的暂时的弱小和国民党的表面上的强大，就错误地断定抗日战争的胜利必须依靠国民党，而且必然是国民党的胜利而不能是人民的胜利，断定国民党可以成为抗日战争的领导者，而否认共产党可以成为抗日战争的领导者。他们低估共产党领导的游击战争在抗日战争中的作用，而幻想倚靠国民党军队求得速胜。他们信任国民党超过信任群众。他们抹煞共产党和国民党在抗日（⑹⑺）战争中的原则分歧，要求共产党人对国民党的反人民政策实行让步，主张共产党人的行动一切经过国民党政府，八路军新四军完全统一于国民党军队，实行“统一指挥，统一编制，统一武装，统一纪律，统一作战计划，统一作战行动”。他们否认统一战线中的独立自主，否认“有团结有斗争，以斗争求团结”的革命方针。他们反对放手发动群众斗争，反对在日本占领地区放手扩大解放区和扩大人民武装，他们害怕这样就要从抗日阵线中“吓跑”了蒋介石国民党，而主张把自己的行动限制在国民党蒋介石所允许的范围以内，去迁就国民党蒋介石。他们不经中央同意擅自发表了很多表示错误意见的宣言、决议和文章，拒绝中央正确的指示。他们这种错误思想和行动，在一九三八年由王明同志在武汉负责的活动中，和一九四一年一月“皖南事变”以前项英同志在新四军的工作中，曾经发生影响，因而妨碍了当时长江流域人民抗日战争的发展，并在皖南事变中造成了新四军部队的失败。很明显，右倾分子的意见是适合于蒋介石的利益而危害无产阶级和抗日人民的利益的。这是第一次国内战争时期陈独秀右倾主义在新的情况下的复活。毛泽东同志和这种错误思想进行了坚决的斗争，因而使这种错误思想在没有发生更大危害的时候就在实际工作中得到了克服。
    为了彻底澄清党内外关于抗日战争的错误思想，毛泽东同志在一九三八年五月写了《论持久战》一书。毛泽东同志在这部著作中详细地分析了中国和日本的政治军事情况，指出了战争的必胜前途，但战争必然是持久战，而不能速胜，中国必须依靠人民战争的方针才能取胜。
    一九三八年十月，中国共产党中央在延安举行了扩大的第六届中央委员会第六次全体会议。这次会议批准了以毛泽东同志为首的中央政治局对于抗日战争和抗日民族统一战线的战线。全会批判了统一战线问题上的迁就主义的错误，决定了全党独立自主地放手组织人民抗日武装斗争的方针，把党的主要工作方面放在战区和敌后，而批判了那种希望把抗日战争的胜利寄托于国民党军队、幻想把人民的命运寄托于国民党反动派统治下的合法运动的错误思想。
    抗日战争的实际发展，证明了毛泽东同志和中国共产党中央的正确。蒋介石的军队在抗日战争初期虽然曾经抵抗过日军，但是因为蒋介石在政治上和军事上的错误，军队迅速溃败，到了一九三八年十月，就不能不退出广州和武汉。蒋介石从此把军队的主力集中在以重庆和西安为中心的中国西南部和西北部，避免和日军作战。而与此相反，中国共产党领导的八路军新四军在华北华东华中华南等地却相继武装了广大的人民，发展了强大的抗日游击战争，建立了许多抗日民主根据地。到了一九四○年抗日战争三周年时，由中国共产党所领导的人民抗日军队已由三年前的四万多人发展到近五十万人，抗击了在华日军的半数，在三年作战中收复了县城一百五十座，毙伤俘日军和伪军四十万人。解放区和游击区人口发展到近一万万。共产党员，也由三年前的四万人发展到八十万人。从辽宁、热河、察哈尔、绥远一线直到广东和海南岛，都有了共产党员所领导的人民抗日武装。抗日战争成为真正全国范围的大革命了。
    敌后游击战争的巨大发展，使日本侵略者在占领武汉、广州以后，就陷入了战争的相持阶段，不能再向前进了，因为他们的后方暴露在强大游击队的攻击之下，他们不得不回头来攻击在他们后方的游击队。日本决定把主要的压力放在敌后战场，对正面停止战略性的进攻，而实行对蒋介石国民党的政治诱降。在此时，中国共产党提出了“坚持抗战，反对投降；坚持团结，反对分裂；坚持进步，反对倒退”的口号，领导全国人民与蒋介石国民党的反动趋势作斗争。蒋介石的投降危险，在一九三九年九月法西斯德国与英法间战争爆发时，达到了顶点。英美在这时更希望赶快牺牲中国来求得和日本妥协，使日本不和希特勒一起来反对英美，而为了使中国投降，就不能不加紧反对坚持抗日战争的共产党。在这种情况下，在一九三九年底到一九四○年初，蒋介石国民党就发动了第一次反共高潮。国民党反动军队向共产党领导的陕甘宁边区侵占五个县城，在山西西部进攻共产党员所领导的抗日决死队，在山西东南部进攻共产党所领导的八路军。受着日本和国民党夹击的八路军，坚决地击退了国民党的进攻。
    严重的斗争放在中国共产党和中国人民的前面。很明显，在日本侵略下的中国，谁能够赢得抗日的胜利，谁就能够赢得全国的胜利。中国共产党既然证明了自己是抗日战争的真正的领导者，就必须同时向全国人民说明自己对于中国革命和新中国的建设的全部见解，以便彻底剥夺国民党反动派及其一切追随者的精神武装，而给与中国工人阶级和中国革命人民以充分的精神武装。这个任务，由毛泽东同志一九四○年一月发表的《新民主主义论》一书担负起来了。《新民主主义论》从中国的历史和世界的历史出发，说明了在俄国十月社会主义革命以后，中国革命的领导权必须属于中国工人阶级；说明了中国革命必须分为新民主主义和社会主义两个阶段，而在工人阶级领导下的新民主主义的前途必然是社会主义；说明了在新民主主义革命时期，党必须采取既区别于资本主义、又区别于社会主义的新民主主义的政治纲领、经济纲领和文化纲领。《新民主主义论》的发表，极大地帮助了党内的思想统一和全国革命人民的思想统一，极大地帮助了全国人民解放区的政策的统一，因而极大地加强了中国革命。
    为了继续扩大和巩固抗日民族统一战线，党在克服了右倾的偏向以后，又采取了一系列的措施以纠正在反对国民党对共产党和人民的进攻中所开始发生的某些“左”倾。党认为：在抗日战争时期，由于民族敌人深入国土，民族矛盾仍然是主要的矛盾，在国民党不投降日军的条件下，保持与国民党不破裂是必要的和可能的，与国民党的斗争必须以不破裂为限度。对于中等资产阶级和开明绅士，更需要注意团结。因此，党规定了“发展进步势力、争取中间势力、孤立顽固势力”的总方针，和在统一战线内部反摩擦斗争中“有理、有利、有节”的指导原则，并且在所有解放区政权中实行了“三三制”，即共产党员（代表工人阶级和贫农）、进步分子（代表小资产阶级）、中间分子（代表中等资产阶级和开明绅士）各占三分之一的制度。
    蒋介石为了削弱共产党的力量，在一九四一年一月又发动了第二次反共高潮。蒋介石强令原在安徽南部的新四军军部及其所属的一支万余人部队北渡长江，在一月七日以八万余人在中途加以包围袭击。新四军的部队损失惨重，军长叶挺被俘，副军长项英牺牲。蒋介石在阴谋实现后，随即宣布取消新四军番号，并下令向新四军其他部队进攻。这个事变被称为“皖南事变”。中国共产党严厉地驳斥了蒋介石取消新四军的“命令”，有准备地粉碎了国民党的进攻，并且使新四军的主力比事变以前更为巩固，在华东地区获得了更大的发展。由于中国共产党在这次事变前后在统一战线工作方面的巨大努力，蒋介石的反共政策并没有孤立共产党，反而惊醒了和教育了许多对蒋介石抱有幻想的人们，因而孤立了蒋介石自己。
    但是皖南事变还是中国人民的困难的开始。从一九四一年初，日本就已经把在中国的侵略军的百分之六十以上集中到敌后解放区战场上来，并且对解放区加紧了大规模的“扫荡”和烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”的毁灭。留在敌后的国民党军，大部分投降了敌人成为伪军，伪军的百分之九十以上在日寇指挥下担任向解放区进攻。蒋介石曾经密令他自己很多的军队投降日寇，然后在日寇指挥之下去进攻八路军和新四军。一九四一年七月，法西斯德国进攻苏联，日本侵略者在太平洋向英美进攻；法西斯阵线在战争初期的进展，更加鼓励了国民党反动派投敌、通敌、包围解放区、反共、反人民的黑暗潮流。国民党反动派在此时用了一切的手段来削弱共产党和人民的力量。在此种情形下，解放区的面积、人口、军队，都缩小了，解放区的财政发生了很大的困难。党不得不用更艰苦的努力来战胜这些困难。党领导解放区的机关学校和部队一律实行生产自给，精兵简政，借以减轻人民负担，并且着重领导人民组织起来发展农业生产，救济灾害。与发展生产的运动同时，党又领导农民实行大规模的减租减息运动。为了在新条件下反对敌人，解放区大大地发展了民兵。解放区军民除了实行反“扫荡”的斗争以外，又派出武装工作队远出“敌后之敌后”，为恢复和扩大解放区而斗争。由于这些努力，一切困难都克服了，解放区得到了进一步的巩固，并且从一九四三年起又逐步地扩大了。
    党抓紧了这个局势较少变化的时期进行了全党范围的马克思列宁主义教育，这种教育在战争和革命猛烈发展或迅速变化的时期曾经是难于大规模进行的。党采取了整风运动的方法，领导全党的干部和党员来认识和克服广泛存在于党内的伪装马克思列宁主义的小资产阶级思想作风，特别是主观主义的倾向，宗派主义的倾向，和这两种倾向表现的形式——党八股。毛泽东同志的演说《改造我们的学习》、《整顿党的作风》、《反对党八股》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和刘少奇同志的演说《论共产党员的修养》、《论党内斗争》，在这个学习运动中起了巨大的作用。这个学习运动，扫除了一九三一年以来教条主义在党内的恶劣影响，帮助了大量的由小资产阶级知识分子出身的新党员脱离小资产阶级的立场而取得无产阶级的立场，因而使党在思想上大大地提高了一步，并且使整个党空前地团结起来了。
    与共产党在艰苦奋斗中前进的同时，国民党的统治一天一天地走到了腐败的极点。国民党的首脑人员利用政治地位，并且特别利用抗日战争，通货膨胀等，集中了大量的财富，控制着中国的金融、商业、工业和农业，进行肆无忌惮的掠夺，迅速地发展了以蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙、陈立夫四大家族为首脑的封建的、买办的、军事的垄断资本，即“官僚资本”。国民党的这种“官僚资本”，与国民党统治区的工人阶级、农民阶级、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的利益都发生了尖锐的矛盾。因为人民的生活极端痛苦，没有抗日的政治自由，以至民怨沸腾，民变蜂起。不顾自己的腐败和孤立，蒋介石在一九四三年六月仍然调动军队在陕甘宁边区周围发起了第三次反共高潮。但是在中国共产党的机警的处置之下，击退了国民党军队的进攻，粉碎了这一次反共高潮。显然，这时蒋介石还以为他的留在战争后方的数百万军队是他的靠山，他还不知道他的反动政策早已腐化了他的军队；这个真相，在一九四四年日本的新进攻中就表现无余了。
    一九四四年是世界反法西斯战争胜利发展的一年，是希特勒匪帮在英勇的苏联军的进攻下灭亡的一年，同时却是国民党军队在日本新进攻下再一次大溃败的一年。日本在太平洋的地位已经愈来愈困难了，它急需把从北京到广州和南宁的铁路线打通，因此在一九四四年三月发起了对于正面战场的新进攻。因为国民党军队望风溃逃，日寇在八个月中，迅速占领了河南、湖南、广西、广东、福建的大部和贵州的一部，人民损失惨重。在以苏联为中坚的世界反法西斯战争的伟大胜利和中国人民解放区战场的胜利发展的鼓舞之下，全国人民对于国民党的反动统治再不能忍受了，国民党统治区的人民民主斗争和民主党派的活动活跃起来了。要求改组国民党政府为民主联合政府，成为爱国人民的一致呼声。
    但是中国人民的民主斗争遇到了新的外国干涉。为人民所痛恨的摇摇欲坠的国民党反动政府，却受到了已经在太平洋上得到优势的美帝国主义的支持。一九四四年九月，中国共产党代表林伯渠同志在重庆国民党召集的国民参政会上，要求立即召开紧急国事会议，废止国民党专政，成立民主联合政府。国民党反动派在美国代表的暗中支持下，顽固地拒绝了共产党和各民主党派的要求。美国帝国主义在一九四一年太平洋战争以前是力图牺牲中国而与日本妥协的，现在却利用抗日战争把自己的势力进一步伸入中国，企图在战争结束以后代替日本独占中国的市场，并使中国变为美国殖民地，因此它就积极努力于维持国民党的反动统治。美帝国主义一方面派了大批军官来训练和武装蒋介石的军队，派了大批专家渗入蒋介石的政府，另一方面，却装出公正的面孔来“调处”国民党和共产党的关系。但是美国政府就很快就暴露出它与蒋介石立场的一致。美国代表和蒋介石都企图用“邀请”某些共产党人参加国民党政府的方法，来“完成”国民党反动政府的“统一”和“民主化”，来取消改组国民党政府为民主联合政府的要求，并企图用这个诡计来消灭八路军、新四军和解放区。在中国共产党拒绝美国和蒋介石的这个恶毒的提议以后，蒋介石竟要求组织一个由美国人参加的三人委员会来“整编”解放区的军队；而美国代表赫尔利，则威胁地宣称美国只同蒋介石合作，不同中国共产党合作。
    一九四五年四月二十四日，中国共产党在延安举行第七次全国代表大会。大会正式代表五百四十四人，候补代表二百零八人，代表着一百二十一万党员。大会听了并且一致地通过了毛泽东同志《论联合政府》的政治报告，和朱德同志《论解放区战场》的军事报告，听了刘少奇同志《论党》的组织报告，并通过了新的党章。大会选出了以毛泽东同志为首的新的中央委员会。
    在第七次大会上，中国共产党表现了空前的团结一致，这个团结一致，是一九三五年一月党的遵义会议以来在党中央正确领导下中国革命的胜利发展所形成的；一九四二年全党的整风运动，在第七次大会之前在党的干部中关于党的历史经验的讨论，六届七中全会所通过的“关于若干历史问题的决议”，都大大地帮助了全党的思想的统一。第七次大会一致地通过了党的总纲，党在新民主主义革命时期的一般纲领和具体纲领。第七次大会分析了当前的世界形势和国内形势，号召全党和全国人民为争取抗日战争的最后胜利和建立民主的联合政府而斗争。为着迎接全国的胜利，大会特别要求全党及时地注意加强在城市中首先是在工人阶级中的工作。大会指出：中国人民在共产党的直接领导下已经在战争中建立了十九个解放区，共有九千五百五十万人口，有九十一万人民解放军（包括八路军新四军和其他人民抗日军）和二百二十万不脱离生产的民兵，并且从一九四四年以来已经转入局部的反攻。从一九三七年九月至一九四五年三月，人民解放军对敌战斗大小十一万五千余次，击毙和杀伤日伪军九十六万名，俘虏日伪军二十八万名，迫使日伪军投诚和反正十万名。全国大多数中心城市、交通线和海岸线，都处在人民解放军的包围或控制之下。依靠强大的人民解放军，依靠全国人民的团结，抗日战争和民主事业的胜利是有保证的。但是由于国内外反动势力的存在，大会同时要求全国人民严重警惕新的全国性内战的危险和帝国主义干涉的危险。
    在中国共产党第七次大会以后，人民解放军对于日本侵略者的反攻得到了迅速的发展。八月八日，苏联对日宣战，使中国抗日战争立即进入最后阶段。苏联军迅速歼灭了日寇的关东军而解放了东北。人民解放军积极消灭日伪军，解放了日伪军所占领的大量的中小城市。八月十四日，日本宣布无条件投降。但是蒋介石却命令在中国的日军和伪军继续“维持地方秩序”，并且继续抵抗包围着日军的人民解放军，以待远在后方的国民党军队前往受降。美国的军队和空军、海军，这时用各种方法把国民党军运往日伪军所占领的大城市和主要交通线去“接收”。在美军、日本侵略军、伪军的共同合作之下，蒋介石从新取得了在全国的“优势”。
    中国人民抗日战争的经验，是一个落后的大国反对帝国主义强国侵略的经验，又是一个由共产党领导的无产阶级与农民、城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级以至一部分地主和买办资产阶级相联合而共同反对侵略的经验。中国共产党正确地分析了这种复杂的形势，并且正确地利用了从一九二四年到一九三六年的两次国内革命战争的政治经验和军事经验，因而采取了正确的政治路线和军事路线，及时地纠正了党内的偏向，打退了国内的反动派，赢得了伟大的胜利，为后来人民民主革命在全国的胜利奠定了巩固的基础。中国的抗日战争证明：在无产阶级的正确领导下，依靠人民群众的团结奋斗，依靠人民统一战线和人民战争，帝国主义的侵略是可以打败的。这对于中国人民和全世界殖民地人民都是一个极端重要的真理。抗日战争又证明：英美帝国主义，对于殖民地半殖民地人民是始终抱着敌视态度的，只有苏联，才是世界被压迫人民的忠实援助者。苏联的援助，对于全世界人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利，具有决定的意义。这对于中国人民和全世界殖民地人民，同样是一个极端重要的真理。
        四  第三次国内革命战争时期，中华人民共和国的成立和经济恢
        复时期
    抗日战争结束以后，中国的阶级关系发生了新的变化。
    代表大地主大资产阶级的国民党反动派，在抗日时期就消极抗日，积极反共，企图削弱共产党的力量，保存和聚积自己的力量，以便在依靠苏联和英美和中国共产党所代表的中国人民的力量打败日本以后，坐收渔人之利，然后举行反共战争，消灭共产党，建立它在全国的黑暗的独裁统治。为了这个目的，国民党反动派把外国援助国民党抗日的武器都保存下来，作为反共之用。因此，在抗日战争结束后，内战危机就立即威胁着全国人民。美帝国主义在日本投降后，则企图代替日本在中国的地位，控制中国广大的市场，使中国变为美国的殖民地。为了这个目的，美国就要援助国民党去消灭共产党，因为共产党是美国实现这个目的的最大阻碍。国民党也要依赖美国的援助才能进行反共内战。美帝国主义和国民党就在这样的基础上进一步地勾结起来，积极地准备着发动对于人民解放区的全面进攻。他们认为：依靠国民党军队在数量上和装备上对于人民解放军所占的优势，依靠国民党统治区在人口和资源上对于解放区所占的优势，依靠美国政府在政治上经济上军事上对于国民党政府的支援，他们是可以达到这个凶恶的和可耻的目的的。
    反人民战争对于大资产阶级即国民党官僚资产阶级集团是有利可图的事业。蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙、陈立夫四大家族，在日本投降以后，已经利用“接收”的名义实行了空前的吞并掠夺，而利用战争的理由所实行的通货膨胀和各种税收、公债、经济统制，更使他们可以大规模地搜刮国民党统治区人民的血汗，以至他们的财富迅速积累到二百万万美元之多。
    国民党在抗日战争中的政策，已使自己与全国工人阶级、农民阶级、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾变得极端尖锐了。经历了多年战争的全国各阶级人民，普遍地要求和平，借以恢复受了严重破坏的生产。人民要求在抗日战争胜利以后实现民族的独立和政治的民主。农民要求得到土地。但是国民党不但不给他们这一切，反而决定把他们再投入内战和破产的深渊。国民党为了得到美国援助而给予美国种种特权，使国民党统治区的民族工商业受到了美国资本和国民党官僚资本双重压迫，纷纷倒闭，工人大批失业。美国驻中国的军队和其他各种人员，给中国人民以各种侮辱损害。国民党的特务机关继续用恐怖的方法迫害人民和民主人士。国民党政府在国民党统治区给农民的是强暴的征兵、征粮，在解放区是组织地主夺取农民所已经得到的土地。
    国民党反动派所决定发动的内战虽然不可避免，国民党反动派在人民中间虽然如此孤立，但是要求和平的人民在内战没有全面爆发以前，仍然希望用一切代价来取得和平，而不希望与国民党破裂。在民族资产阶级及其党派中间，还存在着对于国民党和美国的幻想，还存在着追求国民党共产党以外的“第三条道路”的幻想。中国共产党对于国民党和美帝国主义的内战阴谋，是早已洞悉的，并在思想上组织上都作了充分的准备。但是为了最后挽救和平，并且为了充分地教育人民，中国共产党在抗日战争结束以后，仍然用了极大的努力和忍耐心来领导全国人民寻求避免战争、实现和平团结的道路。
    在抗日战争结束以后，中共中央就在一九四五年八月二十五日发表《对于目前时局的宣言》，表示了中国共产党对于和平民主团结的愿望。为了实现这个愿望，毛泽东同志在八月二十八日亲到重庆与国民党蒋介石举行了一个多月的谈判，最后在十月十日公布了谈判的结果，其中包括许多关于保障国内和平办法的协议。中国共产党是准备忠实地实行自己所同意的协议的，并且已经着手付之实施了，但是在蒋介石方面，却只把这些协议看作是掩护发动战争的手腕。蒋介石以为在协议成立后，共产党的警戒必然松懈，乘机袭击，必然要获得很大的胜利。所以在协议公布后，蒋介石立即发动了对解放区的进攻。但是中国共产党已经有了警惕，蒋介石的军事进攻被粉碎了。
    但是战争还没有就此全面爆发。由于蒋介石的躲避抗日的军队还在西南和西北的远后方，一直在抗日最前线的人民解放军却在华北华东和东北，这种情况，使蒋介石及其美国主人暂时还不利于进行全面的内战。在当时，他们还需要迅速地去接收敌占城市和交通线，还要把数百万军队运到发动内战的前线上来，而这些事蒋介石单靠自己是办不到的。为了办到这些事，美帝国主义给了蒋介石最大的帮助。美军在中国沿海登陆，接受日本投降，阻止解放军去接受投降，并将日军的全部武器交给蒋介石，又用空军和海军运输了蒋介石上百万的军队到解放区的周围，以便发动对于解放区的进攻。为了办好这些事，他们需要时间。为了争取这段时间，蒋介石就被迫接受了中国共产党、中国各民主党派和全国人民的要求，在一九四六年一月十日宣布了停战协议，并随即召集了包括各党派的政治协商会议。美国政府这时在口头上也主张停战。美国曾签字于一九四五年十二月二十七日莫斯科苏美英三国外长会议公报，这个公报表示希望中国保持和平并保证不干涉中国内政。美国政府派了马歇尔代替赫尔利来继续“调处”中国的内战。但是在事实上，马歇尔的任务却只是帮助蒋介石加速战争的准备。在一切准备好了之后，蒋介石首先进攻在日本投降前后进入东北的人民解放军，占领了东北解放区的长春吉林一线以南至安东、以西至承德的广大地区。随后，从一九四六年七月起，蒋介石就彻底撕毁了停战令和政治协商会议决议，指挥他的全部兵力，发起了对于人民解放区的全面的进攻，连续占领了解放区的许多城市和广大乡村。
    中国共产党在这个期间对于全国人民进行了极广大而有效的教育，使全国人民逐步从和平幻想中清醒过来，从对蒋介石和美国政府的幻想中清醒过来，而觉悟到为要实现和平、民主、独立，为要得到生存，就不能不打倒蒋介石，就不能不驱逐美帝国主义。中国共产党在一方面在政治上充分地孤立了美帝国主义和蒋介石，在另一方面领导了人民解放军以严重的努力来粉碎蒋介石的进攻。中国共产党认为：蒋介石的进攻不但是必须打败，而且是能够打败的。这是因为，敌人军事力量的优势，以及美国的援助，都只能起暂时的作用；而战争的正义性或反正义性，人民群众的向背，这才能起经常的作用；而在这方面，由于中国共产党关于国内和平的正确的努力，优势是确定地属于人民解放军的。
    为着打败蒋介石的进攻，毛泽东同志在军事方面规定了坚决的方针，即以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守城市或地方为主要目标；而为了歼灭敌人，就必须每一战役都有准备，都有把握，都集中超过敌人数倍的绝对优势兵力去包围敌人，全部歼灭敌人，避免无准备无把握的作战。在这个方针之下，人民解放军虽然在战争初期退出了许多城市和地方，却歼灭了大量的国民党军，平均约每月歼灭国民党军八个旅师，以缴获国民党军的装备武装了自己，并以俘虏来的士兵加以改造，补充了自己。这样，蒋介石的全面进攻，在遭受了八个月的巨大兵力损失以后，即在一九四七年三月以后，就不得不把对解放区的全面进攻改变为在两个地区的“重点进攻”，即以山东和陕北两翼为其进攻的重点。但是人民解放军又以严重的作战，粉碎了蒋介石对山东和陕北的“重点进攻”，同时在东北、晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫各区陆续转入了反攻。因此，到了一九四七年七月，人民解放军便能够在晋冀鲁豫战场首先转入了进攻，进兵黄河以南直至长江北岸。接着，人民解放军在东北和其他战场上也发起了巨大的攻势作战，根本改变了各战场的形势。因此，蒋介石的进攻，只经过了一年多一点时间，就被完全打破了。
    美帝国主义和蒋介石曾经被战争初期所得的表面的胜利冲昏头脑，拒绝中国共产党和全国人民的一切和平建议，结果使自己在军事上和政治上都走上了死路。在一九四六年十月十一日，国民党军占领了当时华北解放区主要城市张家口。同日下午，蒋介石就违背政治协商会议的决议，下令召开分裂的独裁的伪“国民大会”。十一月十五日，这个伪“国民大会”在美国特使马歇尔、美国大使司徒雷登的支持之下开幕了，通过了伪“宪法”。但是事实证明了毛泽东同志在《论联合政府》中的预言，蒋介石的这个步骤只是“把一条绳索套在自己的脖子上”，在人民中间没有得到任何支持。一九四七年三月，国民党反动派迫令中国共产党驻南京、上海、重庆三地人员撤返延安，随即派军队进攻，占领延安。从此，消灭了任何和平解决的希望。但是这一切都只是使人民包括民族资产阶级在内把同情和希望集中到中国共产党方面来。代表民族资产阶级右翼的“第三条道路”的宣传，也随之而破产。中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、民主建国会等民主党派和广大的社会人士，都拒绝与国民党反动派合作，拒绝参加伪国民大会和反动政府。在一九四六年底一九四七年初，全国学生举行了反对美军强奸中国女学生暴行的示威运动，在一九四七年五月，全国学生又举行了反饥饿、反内战、反压迫的示威运动。各地工人农民，也进行了许多斗争反对国民党。这些都说明了美帝国主义者和国民党反动派已经完全孤立，而以中国共产党为领导的新民主主义革命的统一战线，却比过去任何时候都更为扩大和巩固了。中国人民在全国的胜利，无论在军事上和政治上的条件，都已经成熟了。
    一九四七年十月十日，中国人民解放军发表宣言号召全国人民打倒蒋介石，建设新中国。为了满足农民长久以来的土地要求，中国共产党在同一天公布了中国土地法大纲，宣布废除封建性剥削的土地制度，实行耕者有其田的土地制度。土地改革使解放区农民充分地发动起来了，解放区的地主阶级被消灭了，从而极大地巩固了解放区，援助了人民解放战争。同时，为着贯彻土地改革，加强人民解放军的战斗力，加强农村的民主化，中国共产党领导了全党的整党运动，以提高人民解放军的阶级觉悟，克服农村党内的成份不纯和作风不纯的现象。为了准备新的胜利，中共中央在一九四七年十二月在陕北举行了会议，毛泽东同志在这次会议上作了《目前形势和我们的任务》的报告。毛泽东同志指出中国人民革命战争已经达到转折点，而这个转折点也就是“一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点”。对于党在战争转入进攻的时候所需要解决的军事问题，土地问题，经济问题，统一战线问题，毛泽东同志都作了深刻的说明。鉴于在土地改革运动中曾经发生破坏工商业的偏向，毛泽东同志在报告中曾经着重地从新解释了党在经济方面的纲领，即没收封建阶级的土地归农民所有，没收官僚资本归新民主主义的国家所有，保护民族工商业，并且严格地批判了党内一部分工作人员对中小资产阶级经济成份采取过左政策的错误。毛泽东同志指出：由没收官僚资本而形成的巨大的控制全国经济命脉的社会主义性质的国家经济，将在人民国家的经济生活中具有严重的决定意义和伟大的领导作用，因此，中小资产阶级经济成份的存在，不但是必要的，而且是并不可怕的。由于这次会议以及在这个期间党所进行的各项工作，党为了领导人民夺取全国的胜利，在主观上的准备也成熟了。
    战争在一九四八年和一九四九年的进展极为迅速。在一九四八年，人民解放军已经充分学会了攻城战术，连续攻克了大批国民党“重点设防”的城市。一九四八年九月十二日至十一月二日的辽沈战役胜利后，整个东北已获得了解放。这一战役消灭了国民党军四十七万二千人，从而使人民解放军在数量上也超过了国民党军。接着，在南线，由十一月七日至一九四九年一月十日在徐州附近进行的淮海战役，又消灭了国民党军五十五万五千余人，使国民党反动派丧失了主要的军事力量，并使南京暴露在人民解放军的进攻的面前。差不多在同一期间，在一九四八年十二月五日至一九四九年一月三十一日，人民解放军又在北线举行了解放天津、北京的战役，攻克了张家口和天津，使北京得到了和平解放，并使国民党军损失了五十二万一千人。这样，长江中下游以北地区就在基本上完成了解放。
