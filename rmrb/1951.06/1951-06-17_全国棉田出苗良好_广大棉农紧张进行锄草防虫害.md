Xinhua News Agency, 16th: National cotton fields show good emergence, with an average emergence rate of over 80%. Currently, the broad masses of farmers are tensely carrying out tasks such as weeding and pest control in the cotton fields.

This year, during the cotton planting season, the south experienced flooding while the north experienced drought, affecting the sowing of cotton and causing varying degrees of seedling shortages in the sown cotton fields. Under the call and leadership of the People's Government, cotton farmers in various regions adopted methods such as rush planting and drought-resistant spot planting to launch a concentrated effort in cotton planting. From mid-May to early June, after widespread and thorough rainfall in the major cotton-producing areas of North China, Northwest China, and East China, People's Governments in various regions again led cotton farmers in a concentrated effort to plant cotton and replant seedlings in cotton fields with seedling shortages. Throughout the country, the cotton planting task was finally completed victoriously. Currently, cotton fields in various regions show good emergence, and the seedlings are growing strongly.

According to surveys, in the major cotton-producing areas of North China, Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces, the cotton field emergence rate generally reaches 80% to 90%. The cotton field emergence situation in the Northwest region, including Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and southern Gansu, is also good. In the irrigation area of the Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi, cotton field emergence reaches over 90%, and most cotton seedlings have already grown to over three inches tall. In the East China region, cotton field emergence in Shandong Province and southern Anhui Province is complete; in northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, and northern Jiangsu, over 80% of the cotton seedlings have emerged. In the major cotton-producing area of Central-South China, Henan Province, timely rainfall this spring has resulted in a cotton field emergence rate of over 90%; Hubei's cotton region experienced flooding followed by drought, resulting in poorer cotton field emergence, with an overall emergence rate of 70% to 90% across the province. In the Northeast region, in Liaodong Province, timely rainfall has resulted in the emergence of approximately 80% of the cotton seedlings; it is estimated that emergence in most cotton fields in both Rehe and Liaodong provinces has also reached over 80%. In the Southwest region, in the northern Sichuan and eastern Sichuan administrative areas, excessive rainfall during the cotton planting season caused some of the early-planted cotton seeds to rot before emergence, resulting in many missing seedlings in the cotton fields; in provinces such as western Sichuan and Yunnan, due to drought, only 60% to 70% of the cotton seedlings have emerged.

Currently, cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country are actively carrying out thinning and weeding in the cotton fields. Cotton fields in Shaanxi and Pingyuan provinces have already been weeded once, and some of the earlier-planted cotton fields have begun to be weeded a second time. Weeding and thinning have also begun in the cotton fields of the Hebei cotton region. In addition to weeding, cotton farmers in Northeast China, East China, and other regions are stepping up efforts to prevent and control cotton aphid pests.

### 全国棉田出苗良好   广大棉农紧张进行锄草防虫害

　　全国棉田出苗良好        
    广大棉农紧张进行锄草防虫害
    【新华社十六日讯】全国棉田出苗良好，出苗率平均在百分之八十以上。现在，广大农民正在紧张地进行棉田锄草和防治虫害等工作。
    今年棉田播种时，由于南涝北旱，影响了棉花的播种，已播种的棉田也发生了不同程度的缺苗现象。各地棉农在人民政府号召和领导下，曾采用抢种和抗旱点种等办法，突击植棉。五月中旬至六月初，主要产棉地区华北、西北、华东等地普降透雨后，各地人民政府又领导棉农突击植棉和进行缺苗棉田的补苗工作。全国各地终于胜利完成植棉任务。现各地棉田出苗良好，幼苗茁壮。
    据调查，华北主要产棉区河北、山西、平原三省棉田出苗率，一般达百分之八十至九十。西北区陕西、新疆和甘肃南部地区棉田出苗情况也好，陕西泾惠渠灌溉地区棉田出苗达百分之九十以上，大部棉苗都已高达三寸多。华东区山东省和皖南区的棉田出苗齐全；皖北、苏南、苏北三区出土的棉苗有百分之八十以上。中南主要产棉区河南省，今春雨水及时，棉田出苗达百分之九十以上；湖北棉区因先涝后旱，棉田出苗较差，全省棉田出苗一般可达七至九成。东北区辽东省因雨水适时，有百分之八十左右的棉苗已出土；热河、辽东两省大部棉田估计出苗也达到八成以上。西南区的川北、川东两行政区在棉花播种时期，雨量过多，早种的棉籽，有的未出土即行腐烂，因而棉田缺苗很多；川西、云南等省区因为天旱，出土棉苗仅达六至七成。
    目前，全国棉产区的棉农，正在积极进行棉田的间苗和锄草。陕西、平原两省的棉田已锄过头遍，部分种得较早的棉田已开始锄第二遍。河北棉区的棉田也已开始锄草间苗。东北、华东等地棉农除进行锄草外，正在加紧进行防治棉蚜害虫等工作。
