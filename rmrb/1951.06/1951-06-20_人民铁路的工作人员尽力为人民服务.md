　　People's Railway Workers Strive to Serve the People
To the Editor:
　　Since Liberation, I have witnessed the gradual development of a new style of wholeheartedly serving the people among the staff of the People's Railways under the leadership and education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and I am deeply moved. In December 1949, I traveled on official business from Shijiazhuang to Xi'an via Taiyuan along the Datong-Puzhou Railway, then returned to Tianjin via the Longhai and Jinpu lines. At that time, I felt that our railways still had many shortcomings. For example, the order on the trains was poor; thieves took the opportunity to cause trouble; some train and station staff had a bad attitude towards the masses; giving passengers a very bad impression. This was the result of certain old employees not yet having received good education and transformation after Liberation, and their old bureaucratic style from the old society had not been changed. At the end of April this year, I took the train again on official business, departing from Beijing and traveling through Zhangjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and other places. I deeply felt that, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the railways of New China have been completely transformed. Returning to Beijing from Taiyuan, I took express train No. 16, which was said to be led by a train conductor surnamed Miao. The crew and guards working on the train were kind and considerate to passengers, patiently informing passengers of precautions, helping passengers take care of their luggage, and humbly soliciting passengers' opinions. Passengers were very moved and admired their spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. On another occasion, I took a train from Taiyuan to Beijing. While passing through a station near Shouyang, Shanxi, it was raining heavily. As soon as the train stopped, an old lady with bound feet got off the train, and a railway police comrade ran over and carried her into the station building. Passengers on the train praised this scene and applauded. Truly, only the staff of the People's Railways can care for passengers in this way. Secondly, the propaganda work on the trains is also done very well. The train attendants, with a high spirit of patriotism, carried out propaganda for resisting America and aiding Korea to the passengers. They compiled the content of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, the liberation of farmers, and passenger notices into rhythmic jingles and sang them to the passengers, sweating profusely. These propaganda efforts were vivid and powerful, and very attractive to the audience. An old farmer lady said: "You sing so well! Rest for a while and sing to us again, so that we common people can understand more about national affairs." Thirdly, during the Japanese and Kuomintang period, order at the stations was "maintained" by beating and scolding, of course, it was not "maintained" well. After Liberation, the people's awareness has been raised, and passengers can consciously abide by order; coupled with the scientific and responsible management of the railway comrades, the phenomenon of beating and scolding is no longer seen at the stations. The order at the stations is very good, which is also one of the great characteristics of our People's Railways.
　　In order to cherish our People's Railways, I would like to put forward a few suggestions, hoping that the relevant departments will study and improve them: First, there are no medical personnel on the trains, and it is more difficult to treat passengers who get sick temporarily. Second, the food sold on the dining car is relatively expensive, and the general public and supply-system cadres and soldiers do not dare to eat there. Third, when selling tickets, the seats are often not accurately calculated, so that sometimes there are too many passengers, making the car crowded.
                                             Reader Zhang Jianmin

　　Editor's Note: Regarding the three suggestions made by reader Zhang Jianmin, whether they can be fully implemented under the current conditions is hoped that relevant departments will study and respond.

### 人民铁路的工作人员尽力为人民服务

　　人民铁路的工作人员尽力为人民服务编辑同志：
    解放以后，我眼看着人民铁路的工作人员，在毛主席共产党的领导和教育下，逐渐养成热心为人民服务的新作风，心里十分感动。一九四九年十二月，我因公从石家庄出发，经太原沿同蒲路赴西安，再经陇海和津浦线返回天津。那时，我一路感到我们的铁路还存在不少缺点。如车上秩序不好；小偷乘机捣乱；有些列车和车站工作同志对群众态度不好；给乘客的印象很坏。这是某些旧职员在解放后尚未经过很好的教育、改造，他们的旧社会的官僚主义作风还未改变的结果。今年四月底，我又因公乘火车，由北京出发，行经张家口、大同、太原、石家庄等地。我深深感到，由于毛主席共产党的英明领导，新中国的铁路已完全改观了。从太原回北京，我乘的是十六次快车，据说该车由一位姓苗的车长领导。在该列车工作的乘务和警卫人员，对乘客态度和蔼，照顾周到，耐心告诉旅客注意事项，帮助旅客照管行李，虚心征求旅客意见。乘客们对他们这种热心为人民服务的精神，都非常感动和钦佩。另一次，我由太原乘火车赴北京，在经过山西寿阳附近一个车站时，正下大雨。车停后，一个裹足的老太太刚一下车，就有一位路警同志跑过来，把她背进站房。车上乘客看到这种情景，交口赞扬，有人并鼓起掌来。真的，只有人民铁路的工作人员，才能这样关心乘客。其次，列车上的宣传工作作得也很好。列车乘务员同志以高度爱国主义的精神，向旅客进行了抗美援朝宣传。他们把抗美援朝、镇压反革命、农民翻身、旅客须知等内容，编成快板小调，向乘客演唱，为此累得满头大汗。这些宣传都是生动、有力，很能吸引听众的。一位农民老太太说：“唱得真好！休息一下再给我们唱唱，让我们老百姓多懂些国家大事。”第三，在日寇国民党时期，车站的秩序是靠打、骂来“维持”的，当然“维持”不好。在解放后，人民觉悟提高了，乘客都能自觉地遵守秩序；加上铁路工作同志科学地负责地管理，在车站上再看不到打人、骂人的现象了。车站秩序非常好，这也是我们人民铁路伟大的特点之一。
    为着爱护咱们人民的铁路，我愿提出几点意见，希望有关部门研究改进：第一，列车内没有医务人员，乘客临时得了病，医治比较困难。第二，饭车上卖的饮食较贵，一般群众和供给制的部干、军人都不大敢去吃饭。第三，卖票时往往不精确计算座位，以至有时乘客过多，使车内拥挤。
                                             读者  张健民
    编者按：读者张健民所提的三点建议，在目前条件下能否完全作到，希有关部门研究答复。
