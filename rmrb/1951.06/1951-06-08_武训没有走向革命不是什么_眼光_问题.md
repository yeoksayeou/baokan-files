　　Wu Xun's Failure to Embrace Revolution Was Not a Matter of "Vision"

Editor:
    The June 1st edition of the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" column published some opinions expressing doubts about the criticism of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun." I believe that raising these questions is not surprising for some people who came from the old society and are gradually transforming their thinking. Only by expressing these incorrect thoughts can the discussion be deepened and developed, and the problems resolved.
    I believe that the main cause of these problems is the issue of class stand and viewpoint. If we can stand on the side of the people to look at the problem, we will undoubtedly recognize Wu Xun as a historical sinner.
    For example, Mr. Qi Ming raised the point that Wu Xun was neither a descendant of an official's family nor one of the literati, so how could he have such great vision and the courage to "rebel." This reason is untenable. Were many of the revolutionary heroes in history descendants of officials' families or literati? On the contrary, it is precisely because they were not descendants of officials' families or literati that they embarked on revolution. The reason why Wu Xun did not embrace revolution was not a matter of "vision," but because he was willing to serve the feudal ruling class.
    In addition, those who doubt wrongly praise Wu Xun's "education," and praise Wu Xun's "persevering spirit." I think this is also because they regard education and "spirit" as being above class.

### 武训没有走向革命不是什么“眼光”问题

　　武训没有走向革命不是什么“眼光”问题编辑同志：
    六月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了一些怀疑对武训和《武训传》批评的意见。我认为这些问题的提出，对一些从旧社会里来，而正在逐步改造思想的人说来，是不奇怪的。而只有把这些错误的思想说出来，讨论才能深入与发展，问题才能得到解决。
    我认为：这些问题发生的主要原因，是阶级立场和观点问题。如果我们能站在人民的立场来看问题，无疑地会认清武训是历史的罪人。
    比如弃名先生提出：武训既不是宦门后代，也不是士大夫之流，他那里有那么大的眼光与“造反”的勇气。这个理由是不成立的。历史上的许多革命英雄，难道都是宦门后代与士大夫之流吗？相反，正因为他们不是宦门后代与士大夫之流，才会走向革命。而武训之所以没有走向革命，不是什么“眼光”问题，而是他甘心为封建统治阶级服务。
    此外，怀疑者错误地歌颂武训“兴学”、歌颂武训“坚毅精神”，我认为这也都是把教育和“精神”看成超阶级的缘故。
