    Yongmao Construction Company Should Further Examine Mistakes
    To the Editor:
    In the People's Daily on June 4th, there was a published review by the publicly-owned Yongmao Construction Company regarding the collapse of the tile-drying shed at the brick kiln, which resulted in the death and injury of workers. I believe that Yongmao Construction Company's understanding of the fundamental reasons for such a major accident is quite inadequate in that review.
    As far as I know, Yongmao Construction Company has a branch in Taiyuan, Shanxi, and the reputation of that branch is also very poor. Yongmao Construction Company is a public enterprise, but their leadership does not eliminate the exploitative contractor system; instead, they maintain it. At the Taiyuan construction site, Yongmao Construction Company has outsourced projects through "three-layer" or "four-layer" subcontracting. This irresponsible method, which only aims to save money and effort, gives contractors the opportunity to cut corners and exploit workers, resulting in very low morale among the workers. I ask: How can projects be done well under these conditions? And how can the state avoid losses?
    After such a major unfortunate event occurred at the Beijing Yongmao Construction Company, the company, in its review, only emphasized how "responsible" it was "after the fact," and how much "importance" it attached to the matter, etc., while it did not focus on examining its own faults, such as failing to conduct investigations and research before construction, failing to make precise designs, and failing to supervise and inspect during construction, thus allowing contractors to cut corners. Yongmao Construction Company is one of the large public companies, and it is intolerable that they allowed contractors to illegally exploit workers and cut corners. We hope that the leadership of Yongmao Construction Company will further examine the ideological problems existing in the contracting system. We also hope that the People's Supervisory Organs and the People's Courts will attach great importance to the handling of this matter.

### 永茂建筑公司应进一步检讨错误

    永茂建筑公司应进一步检讨错误编辑同志：
    本月四日的人民日报上，登载了公营永茂建筑公司关于砖窑厂晾瓦棚倒塌，砸死、砸伤工人事件的检讨。我认为永茂建筑公司在该检讨中，对于发生这样重大事故的基本原因的认识是很不足的。
    就我所知，永茂建筑公司在山西太原设有一个分公司，那个分公司的声誉也是很坏的。永茂建筑公司是一个公营企业，但是他们的领导方面并不取消工头剥削制度，而是保持了这种制度。永茂建筑公司在太原工地上曾经把工程“三包”“四包”出去。这种对人民不负责任，只图省钱省事的包工办法，使得包工头有机会偷工减料，剥削工人，因此工人情绪十分低落。试问：这样如何能将工程做好？又如何能使国家不受损失？
    北京永茂建筑公司发生了这样重大的不幸事件后，该公司在检讨中，只着重说明自己在事后如何“负责”，如何“重视”等等，而对自己的过失，如在施工前不调查研究，不精确设计；在施工中又不督促检查，而放任包工头偷工减料等，却不着重检讨。永茂建筑公司是公营的大公司之一，他们竟容许包工头非法剥削工人，偷工减料，这件事影响太大，也是令人不能容忍的。我们希望永茂建筑公司的领导方面，更进一步的检查在包工制度上存在的思想问题。并希望人民监察机关和人民法院十分重视这个问题的处理。
                                                      严国柱
