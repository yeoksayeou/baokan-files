    Sketches from the Korean Battlefield ((Pencil Drawing) Sixteen
    Last winter, the staunch and resolute Chinese People's Volunteer Army, braving the severe cold of minus twenty degrees, broke through ice and waded through water. They broke through the enemy's blocking force of a battalion, an artillery battalion, and more than thirty tanks, successfully crossing the icy currents of the Qingchuan River, completing the task of cutting off the enemy's escape route.
