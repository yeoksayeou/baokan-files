Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th (TASS):

　　U.S. Communist Party General Secretary Dennis, in an interview with reporters, commented on the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the leaders of the U.S. Communist Party, stating: "In an atmosphere of war hysteria, the majority in Truman's court, using the Smith Act to supersede the First Amendment of the Constitution, which clearly stipulates that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances; It refused to consider the lawyers' defense for the eleven Communist leaders. This violates the traditional freedom of Americans to choose their own lawyers, and the right of lawyers to zealously defend their clients and uphold the Constitution.

    Our country is facing a clear and present danger—the danger of Wall Street rushing headlong toward war and fascism. The prolongation of U.S. intervention in Korea, and the war-makers’ efforts to expand the Korean War into a world-wide atomic massacre—this is a clear and present danger. Establishing an American police state according to the model stipulated by the Smith Act and the McCarran Act—this is a clear and present danger. The frantic arms expansion movement and the unbearable economic burden it places on the working people—this is a clear and present danger. The only 'crime' of the Communist leaders is that they advocate peace and social progress, and they oppose war and fascism.

    The Communist Party is being persecuted today precisely because it puts forward such propositions. We warn the American people: The reactionaries here, like the reactionaries in Nazi Germany, will not stop at persecuting Communists. The reactionaries will try to use this verdict not only to suppress the Communist Party, but also to crush trade unions, intensify terror against black people, and suffocate the growing peace movement. But, if the American people realize that this verdict is not only a blow to the Communist Party, but also a blow to peace and the democratic rights and living standards of all people; then, the American imitators of Hitler and Tojo can still be defeated even at this late hour.

    The Communist Party will apply to the court for an immediate retrial. It firmly believes that millions of Americans in the labor force and all peace advocates will support this request.

    No matter what happens, the Communist Party will continue to strive to unite the American people against the monopoly capitalists and their political agents who are striving to plunge our country into the catastrophe of World War III. No matter what happens, the cause of peace, democracy and social progress will continue to gain supporters and defeat its enemies.”

　　但尼斯发表谈话      
    美共将团结人民加紧斗争
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约五日电：美国共产党总书记但尼斯在接见记者时评论美国最高法院对美国共产党领袖所作的判决称：“在战争歇斯底里的氛围中，杜鲁门法院中的多数通过用史密斯思想控制法来代替宪法中的第一项修正条款，这一条款清清楚楚地规定禁止国会制定任何剥夺言论自由、出版自由、集会自由或信仰自由的法律。它拒绝考虑律师们为共产党十一领袖提出的辩护。这就侵犯了美国人的选择他们自己的律师的传统自由、也侵犯了律师们热心地为他们的委托者进行辩护并维护宪法的权利。
    我国正面临着明显而现实的危险——华尔街向战争与法西斯主义疾进的危险。美国在朝鲜的干涉延长了，战争制造者极力想把朝鲜战争扩大成世界范围的原子屠杀——这是明显而现实的危险。按照史密斯法及麦卡伦法所规定的模型建立美利坚警察国家——这是明显而现实的危险。疯狂的扩充军备运动以及它加在劳动人民身上的沉重不堪的经济负担——这是明显而现实的危险。共产党领袖们的唯一的‘罪状’是他们主张和平与社会进步，他们反对战争与法西斯主义。
    共产党今天就是因为提出这种主张而受到了迫害。我们警告美国人民：这里的反动派和纳粹德国的反动派一样，在迫害共产党员后不会就此罢休。反动派将设法利用这个判决，不仅镇压共产党，而且粉碎工会，加剧对黑种人民的恐怖并窒息生长中的和平运动。但是，如果美国人民认识到：这个判决不仅是对共产党的打击，而且是对和平与一切人的民主权利及生活水平的打击；那末，希特勒与东条的美国仿效者就在这样晚的时间也仍然是可以击败的。
    共产党将申请法院立即重新审讯。它深信劳工队伍中的千百万美国人以及所有的和平拥护者都会支持这一要求。
    不管发生什么事情，共产党都要继续努力，团结美国人民、反对那些力谋把我们的国家投入第三次世界大战的灾难的垄断资本家和他们的政治代理人。不管发生什么事情，和平、民主及社会进步的事业都会不断获得支持者并战胜它的敌人。”
