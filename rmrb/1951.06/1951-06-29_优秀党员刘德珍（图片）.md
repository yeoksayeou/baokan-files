    (Fourteen) In his work, he fully demonstrated the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice for the cause of the motherland. In June, the gasket of the No. 6 machine's large machine door leaked steam. He was suffering from severe dysentery at the time. When he heard that the gasket of the No. 6 machine was leaking, he insisted on working for six hours in the 70-degree Celsius high temperature environment. Thanks to his and everyone's efforts, he completed five days of work in one day.
    (Fifteen) His group was the first production group in the country to respond to the Ma Hengchang group's challenge, driving the entire factory. Not only can they exceed production tasks, but the quality is also fully qualified. There have never been any rework issues. This April, they were the first to initiate the patriotic pact. His workshop has added 300 million yuan in wealth to the country.
