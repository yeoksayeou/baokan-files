　　Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Korean People's Resistance Against Aggression
    British Communist Party Statement Condemns American Aggression in Korea
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the 24th, the anniversary of the Korean people's heroic struggle against American aggression, condemning the American-led attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and calling on the British people to do everything possible to stop the war and alleviate the suffering of the Korean people.
    The Political Committee emphasized that the purpose of the American warmongers in launching the war was to establish war bases on the border of the People's Republic of China. The statement pointed out: "This is America's war. ...This is a war in direct violation of the purposes and procedures of the United Nations, because the UN Charter is based on the principle of unanimity among the major powers. All resolutions on Korea were passed without the consent of two major powers – the Soviet Union and China." The Political Committee demanded that British and other foreign troops withdraw from Korea, advocated that the People's Republic of China participate in the United Nations, and advocated a meeting of the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty.

　　纪念朝鲜人民反抗侵略一周年
    英共声明斥美国侵朝
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：英国共产党政治委员会于二十四日就朝鲜人民为反对美国侵略进行英勇斗争的一周年发表声明，指责美国所领导的对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，并号召英国人民尽一切可能制止战争，消除朝鲜人民的苦难。
    政治委员会强调指出：美国战争贩子发动战争的目的，是要在中华人民共和国的边境上建立战争基地。声明指出：“这是美国的战争。……这是一个直接违背联合国的宗旨与程序的战争，因为联合国宪章是以大国一致的原则为基础的。关于朝鲜的一切决议都是在没有取得两个大国——苏联与中国——同意的情况下通过的。”政治委员会要求英国军队及其他外国军队撤出朝鲜，主张让中华人民共和国参加联合国组织，主张五大国会谈以便缔结和平公约。
