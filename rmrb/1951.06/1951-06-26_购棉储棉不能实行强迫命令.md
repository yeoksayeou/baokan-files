Cotton Purchase and Storage Cannot Be Enforced Through Coercive Orders
     Lin Wei
    In the work of purchasing and storing cotton, some areas, through in-depth publicity and education work among the cotton farmers, have made the cotton farmers understand the truth of "protecting the country to prosper the family" and have made them aware that the long-term shutdown of spinning mills due to insufficient supply of raw cotton "will affect the supply of clothing for the military and civilians across the country and the stability of prices, which will affect the war and the interests of the majority of the people across the country" (June 1st "Instructions on Cotton Purchase and Storage Work" from the State Council of the Central People's Government). As a result, a conscious and voluntary cotton selling and storage movement has been launched, and a large amount of cotton stored in the hands of cotton farmers has been purchased or stored at reasonable listed prices. However, on the other hand, some areas have not paid attention to publicity and education work, or the publicity and education work has not been carried out in depth, so the cotton purchase and storage work has not achieved the due results. Some have even adopted simple commandist methods to carry out "assigned sales of cotton," causing serious negative consequences.

    The Henan Daily published a news item on the 15th of this month about the phenomenon of assigned cotton sales in the Tenth District of Luyi County, Henan Province. The news said that the district accepted the task of purchasing and storing cotton before the wheat harvest, with a goal of 40,000 jin. The district immediately held a meeting of township cadres and assigned the task to the townships. Because most of the township cadres were farmers who had just been elected in the land reform this spring, although they were active and responsible in their work, they were not quite as good at understanding the spirit of the policy, and their working methods were not flexible enough. Therefore, when deploying the task of purchasing and storing cotton at the village cadre meetings, they did not explain the reasons and methods clearly, but simply asked the village cadres to acknowledge the sales and storage figures for each village. Many village cadres, after returning to their villages, only knew that this task was glorious and important and should be completed quickly, but did not know how to publicize and explain to the masses, or how to proceed step by step. As a result, assigned cotton sales occurred in four or five townships. Taking Cuitang Village in Cuitang Township as an example, the village cadres acknowledged the sale of 400 jin of cotton in the township. After returning to the village, they did not fully explain the reasons to the masses, but said: "Whoever has cotton in stock should sell it to the government, or lend it to the government first, with guaranteed principal and value." The masses did not understand the meaning of selling and storing cotton. During the discussion, many said they had no cotton. Only one household was found to have 50 jin of cotton in stock, but they were unwilling to sell it. The village cadres had no choice but to assign cotton to each household at a rate of four liang of cotton per mu of land, regardless of whether they had any or not. The masses, who had no cotton at home, went to the market to buy it. One household sold five sheng of soybean seeds to buy twelve liang of cotton. There were not many cotton sellers in that area, and after this rush, the price of cotton rose from 8,000 yuan per jin to 15,000 yuan per jin within three days. But it was still not available. Some even ran to Taikang, more than a hundred li away, to buy it. The market price of cotton rose, and the government's listed price (8,700 yuan per jin) seemed too low, so households with cotton in stock were unwilling to sell it to the government, which further affected the purchase. The cotton already bought by the masses would result in a large loss if resold to the government at the listed price. As a result, both the state and the masses suffered losses, arousing dissatisfaction among the masses. The masses who could not buy cotton had a heavy ideological burden, worrying while harvesting wheat. This erroneous practice, after inspection, has been prohibited from being adopted. But the impact is very bad.

    On the 23rd of this month, the Dazhong Daily reported on the cotton purchase and storage work in the Dezhou area of Shandong. One section said: Some cooperative cadres in Wuqiao County, due to the urgency of the task, even said to the cooperative members during mobilization: "If you love the country, sell cotton; if you don't sell cotton, you don't love the country, you are Chiang Kai-shek...." The masses did not understand the great political significance of selling cotton, and as a result, not even a jin was sold.

    According to news from the Hebei Daily, cadres in Beixiaowang Village, Boye County, Hebei Province, held a purely task-oriented view in the cotton purchase and storage work, and did not pay attention to political propaganda, but simply counted the cotton in stock from household to household, making the cotton farmers unaware of what was going on and uneasy in their hearts, and as a result, the task was not completed.

    In Zhentou Town, District Six of Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, 67 cotton farmers had sold nearly 15,000 jin of cotton in stock by the 12th of this month. The achievement is considerable. However, after in-depth investigation, there is still a lot of cotton that has not been sold. The reason for the check is that the town cadres have only focused their attention on a few cotton farmers who are generally considered to have cotton in stock, and have done very little publicity and education work among the broad masses. Therefore, a broad mass persuasion campaign cannot be formed. The CCP branch in the town, in addition to holding one branch committee meeting, did not conduct any political mobilization among the general party members.

    Even more seriously, some county-level leading organs have also acquiesced to this practice of not paying attention to political propaganda and even resorting to coercive orders, and even praised and promoted it. The Qingyuan County Committee of the CCP in Hebei Province issued a notice on the 13th of this month praising the working method of the Xiguzhuang branch. One section said: When party member Guo Ying went to cotton farmer Yang Luodian's home to mobilize the sale of cotton, Yang initially only said that he had eight jin of cotton in stock; the second time he mobilized Yang's wife, she reported another four jin, for a total of twelve jin. In order to find out the root of Yang's family, Guo Ying went to Yang's house to "help" weigh the cotton, and the result was 24 jin. The notice called this practice "the method of inserting a pole to the end," saying that this method was "not only successful, but also very effective."

    These comrades regard the task of purchasing and storing cotton as a purely technical job or a simple "official business." They also talk about the importance of political mobilization in words, and they also do some publicity work at the beginning of the work. But they actually do not believe or do not believe much in the effectiveness of political propaganda. They pay more attention to certain "skills" in the work and how to force the peasants to take out their things. In the eyes of these comrades, since "helping" to weigh the cotton at a farmer's house can bring out twice as much, it is naturally very "successful." But they have not thought about how this farmer and other farmers who hear about this matter will think and do. If the reasons are not made clear from the overall long-term interests of the country, the entire people, and all cotton farmers, the masses will come up with various methods to make any of your "skills" ineffective. Some comrades who are accustomed to using coercive methods to complete tasks often emphasize: My method is not good, but it can complete the task! Political mobilization is good, but the task cannot be completed. These comrades should carefully study the lessons of Luyi and other places to see what kind of results their practices will produce.

　　购棉储棉不能实行强迫命令
     林韦
    在购棉储棉工作中，有些地区由于对棉农群众进行了深入的宣传教育工作，使棉农认识了“保国才能发家”的真理，认识了纱厂因原棉供应不足而长期停工，“将影响到全国军民衣着的供应和物价的稳定，也就是影响战争和全国多数人民的利益”（中央人民政府政务院六月一日“关于购棉储棉工作的指示”），因而掀起了自觉自愿的售棉储棉运动，在合理牌价下收购或收存了棉农手里大量的存棉。但是，另一方面，也有一些地区由于不注意宣传教育工作，或者宣传教育工作做得很不深入，使购棉储棉工作未能得到应有的成绩。有的甚至采取简单的命令主义方法进行“摊派售棉”，造成严重的恶果。
    本月十五日的河南日报上，发表了一篇河南鹿邑县第十区发生摊派售棉现象的新闻。这条新闻说，该区在麦收前接受购棉储棉任务，奋斗目标为四万斤。该区当即召开乡干部会议，把任务分配到乡。因为大部分乡干部是今春土地改革中才选拔出来的农民，对工作虽然积极负责，但在领会政策精神上还差一些，工作的方式方法也不灵活，所以在村干部会议上布置购棉储棉任务时，没有把道理和办法讲清楚，简单地叫各村干部自认各村售储数字。许多村干部回村后，只知这一任务光荣、重要，应该赶快完成，而不知如何向群众宣传解释，如何有步骤地进行。结果有四、五个乡发生了摊派售棉的现象。以崔堂乡的崔堂村为例，该村村干部在乡里认售棉花四百斤。回村后，道理没有完全向群众说清楚，就说：“谁家有现存的棉花都卖给公家，或是先借给公家，保本保值。”群众不明白售棉储棉的意义，讨论时多说没有棉花。只发现一户有存棉五十斤，还不愿出卖。村干部没有办法，就不管谁家有与没有，按每亩地四两棉花摊派下去了。群众家里没有棉花的，便纷纷到集上去买。有一户为买十二两棉花，把五升豆种也卖了。那一带集上本来卖棉的就不多，经这一哄，三天内棉价就由八千元一斤涨到了一万五千元一斤。但还是买不着。有的便跑到一百多里以外的太康去买。棉花市价抬高了，公家的牌价（八千七百元一斤）相形太低，有存棉的户也不肯卖给公家，更影响了收购。群众已买的花，如按牌价再卖给公家，还得赔很多钱。结果是国家与群众都受损失，引起群众不满。买不到棉花的群众，思想负担很重，一边收麦一边还在发愁。这一错误作法经检查发现，已禁止采用。但影响是很坏的。
    本月二十三日，大众日报报道山东德州专区购棉储棉工作。其中有一段说：吴桥县有的合作社干部因任务紧迫，在向社员群众进行动员时竟说：“你爱国就卖棉，不卖棉就是不爱国，就是小蒋介石……。”群众不了解卖棉的重大政治意义，结果一斤也没有卖出来。
    又据河北日报消息，该省博野县北小王村干部在购棉储棉工作中抱着单纯任务观点，不注意政治宣传，只是简单地挨户统计存棉，闹得棉农不知道是怎么回事，心中不安，结果任务没有完成。
    河北石家庄市郊六区振头镇至本月十二日止，已有六十七户棉农卖出将近一万五千斤存棉。成绩是可观的。但近经深入调查，还有不少棉花尚未卖出。检查原因，是该镇干部仅仅把注意力集中在一般认为有存棉的少数棉农身上，对广大群众的宣传教育工作做得很少，因此不能形成广大群众性的劝售。该镇中共支部除开过一次支委会外，在一般党员中就没有进行过政治动员。
    更严重的，是有的县级领导机关也对这种不注意政治宣传以至强迫命令的作法表示默许，甚至给予表扬和推广。中共河北清苑县委本月十三日通报表扬西顾庄支部的工作方法，其中有一段说：该支部党员郭英到棉农杨洛殿家去动员售棉时，杨开头只说有存棉八斤；第二次动员杨的媳妇，又报了四斤，共十二斤。郭英为弄清杨家根底，就去杨家“帮助”过秤，结果是二十四斤。该通报把这一做法称为“一杆子插到底的方法”，说这种方法“不但成功，而且收效很大”。
    这些同志，都是把购棉储棉的任务看成了单纯的技术工作或简单的“公事”。他们口头上也讲政治动员重要，工作一开始时也还做些宣传工作。但他们实际上是不相信或不大相信政治宣传的效力的。他们更注意的是工作中的某些“技巧”和如何迫使农民把东西拿出来。在这些同志看来，既然到一个农民家里“帮助”过一下秤，就可以多拿出来一倍，自然是很“成功”的了。但他们没有想一想：这一家农民以至听到这件事情的其他农民会怎样想，怎样做。如果不从整个国家、全体人民和全体棉农的远大利益上把道理讲清楚，群众会想出各种方法使你的任何“技巧”归于无效的。有些习惯于用强迫命令方法去完成任务的同志时常强调说：我的做法不好，但是能够完成任务！政治动员好，就是完不成任务。这些同志应该仔细研究一下鹿邑等地的教训，看自己的做法究竟会发生什么样的结果。
