Repairing the Great Kiln
    ——A Record of Communist Party Member Liu Maoyou's Exemplary Deeds in Production
       Han Li
    Liu Maoyou of the Dalian Glass Factory is an outstanding Communist Party member. After being educated by the Party, he established the concept of striving for the cause of communism for the rest of his life. Therefore, he loves his factory and his work.
    Now, Liu Maoyou and all the workers in the workshop have formulated a new production plan as a gift to the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party. The main content of the plan is: not only to ensure the completion of the production plan, but also to strive to exceed the original plan by 5%; in terms of product quality, first-class products should account for 90% (the factory requires 85%); and costs should be reduced by 10%. The large kiln has been repaired six days ahead of schedule and will be used for 20 months.

    Liu Maoyou remembers very clearly: on January 30, 1948, because he did not pay attention to inspecting production and studying production conditions, the large kiln was corroded by gas, and glass solution bulged on the wall of the large kiln. As a last resort, production had to be stopped for nine days, which caused great losses to the factory. Since then, Liu Maoyou has kept this lesson in mind at all times and inspected production with his fellow workers in the workshop. In 1949, Liu Maoyou was awarded the honorary title of Dalian Labor Model for his contribution to mobilizing workers to protect the large kiln.
    Last autumn, Liu Maoyou was elected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. At this meeting, Liu Maoyou saw Chairman Mao. He thought: in the past, when working for the Japanese devils, his children and wife could not get enough to eat, and they could not wear cotton clothes in winter.... After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the workers became the masters of the country, and he was elected as a labor model, and especially gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. During the grand National Day parade in the capital, Liu Maoyou saw the neat ranks of the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force, and saw the strength of the Chinese people, which further increased his love for the motherland, his love for Chairman Mao, and his love for the Party. After returning from the meeting, Liu Maoyou always kept in mind Chairman Mao's instructions to labor models: "Unite the masses and improve production."
    Last winter, after the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect the country and defend the homeland was launched, Liu Maoyou paid more attention to studying and inspecting production conditions and various equipment to ensure the victorious advance of the patriotic production movement. Liu Maoyou knew that the melting kiln, the heart of the glass factory, had reached its service life, so he conducted an inspection with all the workers in the workshop. The inspection results showed that the large kiln had indeed reached the repair period. The pillars of the gas outlet in the large kiln have been scorched by the gas fire over the past year and have begun to shed sand; if it is extended further, there is a danger of collapse. However, the iron bricks for repairing the kiln have not been prepared, so it cannot be repaired immediately; if production is stopped to wait for the kiln repair materials, it will affect the completion of the production plan. Liu Maoyou thought: Once the melting kiln is shut down, the entire factory will not be able to produce. At this time, the factory's Party organization also gave Liu Maoyou a task: to lead all the workers to overcome this difficulty and persist in production in order to complete the production plan. Liu Maoyou thought: That's right, a Communist Party member should overcome all difficulties to complete the task assigned to him by the Party. So he began to study where the key to extending the life of the large kiln lay, and mobilized all the workers in the workshop to come up with ideas. Liu Maoyou painstakingly studied, circling around the large kiln and the small kiln all day long, thinking about how to prevent the two pillars of the gas outlet from being eroded by the fire again, so as to extend the life of the large kiln. The gas fire was melting the glass vigorously in the large kiln, and the gas outlet could not be repaired. Liu Maoyou finally came up with a solution: put "silica bricks" into the gas outlet to block the two pillars and prevent the gas fire from eroding them again. Liu Maoyou also humbly consulted with the old technicians. After obtaining the consent of the old technicians, Liu Maoyou presented this method to the workshop production meeting for approval. The work of repairing the large kiln began with great confidence. The large kiln was thus extended its life. However, in February of this year, the neck of the small kiln collapsed again, and gas fire had penetrated in some places. At this time, after further research, Liu Maoyou installed a blower pipe to blow cool air to cool the heat, keeping the neck of the small kiln from being eroded by the heat of the gas fire and collapsing, and continuing to extend the life of the large kiln. Soon, it was discovered that the temperature of the molten glass was not high enough because there was too much dust in the gas flue and the gas fire could not flow smoothly. Liu Maoyou came up with a solution to install a fan to blow away the soot. Liu Maoyou finally completed the task assigned to him by the Party, ensuring the output and quality of production.
    One characteristic of Liu Maoyou's work is that he is good at making various meticulous plans. This kiln repair plan was made relatively meticulously, and the manpower was well organized, so that the kiln repair plan was completed ahead of schedule. During this period, victories were won one after another: releasing the glass solution was originally planned to take six hours, but it was completed two hours ahead of schedule. At these critical production moments, if the manpower organization and preparation work were not done well, the glass solution would not be released; if the gas valve and the air valve were not closed correspondingly, an explosion would occur.

    Liu Maoyou's workshop has created a new record of extending the life of the large kiln by seventeen and a half months in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. In addition, it also managed to increase the output and quality of glass, and gradually reduced costs, so that last year's production plan was overfulfilled by 54.58%; this year's first quarter production exceeded the plan by 20.3%; and substandard products were eliminated, so that first-class products accounted for more than 88% of the entire product. Special-grade glass for making mirrors can also be manufactured.

　　修大窑
    ——记共产党员刘茂有在生产上的模范事迹　
       寒厉
    大连玻璃工厂刘茂有是一个优秀的共产党员。他经过党的教育后，树立了终身为共产主义事业奋斗的观念。因此，他在工作中热爱自己的工厂，热爱劳动。
    现在，刘茂有和全车间工人订出了新的生产计划，作为对党的三十周年纪念日的献礼。计划的主要内容是：不仅保证完成生产计划，并要争取超过原计划百分之五；在产品质量上，一等品要占百分之九十（工厂要求是百分之八十五）；并要降低成本百分之十。大窑已提前六天修好，要争取使用二十个月。
    ★          ★      ★
    刘茂有很清楚地记着：一九四八年的一月三十日，因为平时不注意检查生产和研究生产情况，大窑被瓦斯火蚀透了，在大窑壁上鼓出了玻璃溶液。不得已，只好停止生产九天；这使工厂遭受到很大的损失。从此，刘茂有时时刻刻牢记着这个教训，和车间工友一同检查生产情况。一九四九年，刘茂有因为发动工人保护大窑有功，荣获了旅大劳动模范的光荣称号。
    去年秋天刘茂有被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。在这次会议上，刘茂有看见了毛主席，他想起：过去给日本鬼子作工，孩子老婆都吃不上饭，冬天穿不上棉衣……。解放后，在毛主席领导下，工人作了国家的主人，自己被选为劳动模范，特别是光荣地参加了中国共产党。刘茂有在首都纪念国庆节的大检阅中，看到了伟大的中国人民解放军的陆、海、空军的整齐队伍，看到了中国人民的力量，更增加了对祖国的热爱，对毛主席的热爱，对党的热爱。开会回去后，刘茂有时时刻刻记着毛主席对劳动模范的指示：“团结群众，改进生产。”
    去年冬天，抗美援朝保家卫国运动展开后，刘茂有更加注意研究和检查生产情况与各种设备，以保证爱国主义生产运动胜利前进。刘茂有知道：玻璃厂心脏的熔化大窑已到使用期限，就和全车间工人进行检查。检查结果：大窑确实已到修理时期。大窑里瓦斯吹出口的悬柱，一年来被瓦斯火侵蚀得都已发焦，并已开始掉沙子；再要延长下去，就有塌下来的危险。但修窑的铁砖还没有准备齐，不能马上修；要是停火等待修窑器材，又要影响生产计划的完成。刘茂有想：熔化大窑一停工，全厂就不能进行生产。这时工厂的党组织也给了刘茂有一个任务：要刘茂有领导全体工友，克服这个困难，坚持生产，以完成生产计划。刘茂有就想：对的，一个共产党员，就应当克服一切困难，去完成党交给自己的任务。于是他开始研究延长大窑寿命的关键问题在那里，并发动全车间工友想办法。刘茂有苦心地钻研，整天围着大窑和小窑转圈，走过来转过去的想怎样使瓦斯吹出口的两个悬柱再不被火侵蚀，以延长大窑的寿命。瓦斯火在大窑里旺盛地熔化着玻璃，不能折修瓦斯吹出口。刘茂有终于想到一个办法：用“硅石砖”放进瓦斯吹出口，挡着两面的悬柱，防止瓦斯火再侵蚀。刘茂有又虚心地和老技术工人研究。得到老技术工人同意后，刘茂有才把这办法拿到车间生产会议上通过。修大窑的工作就很有把握地开始了。大窑因此延长了寿命。但是，今年二月间，小窑脖上又发生了塌坍现象，有的地方瓦斯火已透出来。这时刘茂有又经过钻研，装上吹风管，吹送凉气冷却热度，保持了小窑脖不再被瓦斯火的热度侵蚀而塌坍，继续延长大窑的寿命。不久，又发现溶化玻璃的温度不够，因为瓦斯烟道灰尘太多，瓦斯火不能畅通。刘茂有又想办法安装风车吹扫烟灰。刘茂有终于完成了党交给自己的任务，保证了生产的产量和质量。
    刘茂有的工作有一个特点：善于作出各种周密的计划。这次修窑计划就作的比较周密，人力组织的好，使修窑计划提前完成。在这个期间，连战连胜：放玻璃溶液，原计划需六个钟头，结果提前两个钟头完成了。这些紧要的生产关头，如果人力组织和准备工作作得不好，玻璃溶液就会放不出来；瓦斯门与风门关的不相应，就会发生爆炸。  ★       
   ★        ★
    刘茂有的车间，在抗美援朝运动中，就是这样创造了延长大窑寿命十七个半月的新纪录。此外，还设法提高了玻璃的产量和质量，逐步降低了成本，使去年生产计划超额完成百分之五十四点五八；今年的第一季生产，超过计划百分之二十点三；并消灭了三等品，使一等品占整个产品的百分之八十八以上。供制镜子用的特等玻璃也已能制造了。
