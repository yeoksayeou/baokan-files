　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Supply Headquarters Beijing Branch
    Accepts Readers' Suggestions to Improve Grain Rationing Work

Comrade Editor:

    The People's Daily published on May 16th the opinions of Comrade Zhongren of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot regarding improvements to the food rationing system of the Beijing Liaison Office of the Railway Supply Headquarters (the "Beijing Liaison Office" was renamed the Beijing Branch Headquarters in January 1951). We believe these opinions are fundamentally correct and are of great help to our work.

    Regarding the price of corn flour rations in January of this year, the price of 18,500 yuan per bag was determined at the time by referring to the market prices in Nankou, Baoding, Beijing, and other places, and in conjunction with the price reduction in the Tianjin area. After discovering that individual regions reflected that the price was relatively high, we have gradually sought improvements. At the May 6th headquarters meeting, it was decided that the grain brand and price would be announced in advance in the future, and the allocation will be based on the principle of voluntary registration.

    The issue of insufficient weight of Xi'an flour is mainly because we neglected inspection. At the same time, due to the long transportation distance and damage during transportation, there were weight deficiencies. Due to our negligence in our work, employees suffered losses. In order to correct this shortcoming, procurement has been changed to local sources since May.

    Regarding the discoloration of Weinan flour, our inspection confirmed this: When the flour was transported back from Weinan, it was discovered that the flour bags were stained red by the bottom of the train car. This was because the train car had just transported red soil and the escorts had not cleaned the bottom of the car thoroughly. The escorts made a self-criticism at the time and promised to thoroughly clean the bottom of the car in the future.

    Generally speaking, many deviations have occurred in our implementation of the rationing system in the past. Although some areas have now been corrected, shortcomings still exist. We hope everyone will offer more suggestions so that we can jointly improve the railway supply business.

### 天津铁路局供给总店北京分总店  接受读者所提意见  改进粮食配售工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　天津铁路局供给总店北京分总店
    接受读者所提意见  改进粮食配售工作编辑同志：
    五月十六日人民日报刊登了丰台机务段中人同志对铁路供给总店北京联络处（一九五一年一月“北京联络处”已改称北京分总店）提出改善配售食粮的意见，我们认为这些意见基本上是正确的，对我们的工作有着很大的帮助。
    关于本年一月份配售玉米粉价格，在定价当时是参照了南口、保定及北京等地的市场价格并配合了天津地区扣价而定了每袋一万八千五百元，后发现个别地区反映价格较高，我们已逐渐求得了改进。并于五月六日总店会议上决定，今后预先公布粮食牌号和价格。配给是采自愿登记的原则。
    关于西安粉分量不足的问题，主要是因为我们忽略了检查。同时由于运输途程过长，加以运搬中的破损，其中亏秤是有的。由于我们工作上的粗忽致使职工受到损失。为了纠正这缺点，已由五月份起改由近地采购。
    关于渭南粉变了颜色，经我们检查事实是这样：当面粉由渭南运回时，发现了面袋被车底染红。这是因为运面车中有刚运送完红土的，押运人员没扫干净所致，当时曾由押运人员检讨，保证今后彻底清扫车底。
    总的说来，在我们执行配售制度上过去发生了很多偏差。虽然有些地方现已纠正，但存在缺点还是有的。希望大家多提意见，共同把铁路供给业务搞好。
