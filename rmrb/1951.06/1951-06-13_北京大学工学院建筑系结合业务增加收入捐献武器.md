The entire faculty and students of the Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Peking University, enthusiastically responded to the call of the China People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to donate airplanes and cannons. Everyone actively used their brains and came up with many ways to increase income.

　　Fourth-year students decided to make models in the sculpture room for sale, and to carry out drafting, surveying and mapping work in their spare time to increase income; three students have already started surveying and mapping work. First-year students want to increase their income by drawing advertisements, trademarks, and comic books; Professor Zhao Zhengzhi has already helped them make contact regarding surveying ancient sites. Second and third-year students proposed to carry out drafting and surveying work in conjunction with internships; Department Head Professor Zhu Zhaoxue, upon hearing their opinions, excitedly said: "I will definitely fully support your actions!"

　　The teachers have decided to first donate the 10 million yuan from the past surplus of the Department of Architecture's service department and decided to donate all subsequent income from the service department, except for necessary expenses. In addition, Mr. Song Bo suggested making plaster models and donated 200 jin of plaster as a production increase fund. Mr. Wang Zhiying proposed making anatomical models and painting large portraits, etc. Everyone came up with many ways to ensure that they will work hard to increase production and donate airplanes and cannons to support the volunteers in driving the American devils out of Korea as soon as possible.

　　北京大学工学院建筑系结合业务增加收入捐献武器
    北京大学工学院建筑系全体师生热烈响应中国人民抗美援朝总会捐献飞机大炮的号召，大家积极开动脑筋，想出许多办法来增加收入。
    四年级同学决定在雕塑室里作模型出卖，并在课余进行制图、测绘等工作，来增加收入；有三个同学已经开始进行测绘工作。一年级同学要以画广告、商标、小人书等来增加收入；赵正之教授已经帮助他们接洽好了关于勘查古迹的工作。二、三年级同学提出与实习相结合地来进行制图、测绘工作；系主任朱兆雪教授听到他们的意见后，兴奋地说：“我一定全力支持你们的行动！”
    老师们已决定首先把建筑系服务部过去盈余的一千万元捐出来，并决定把服务部以后的收入，除必要开支外全部捐出。此外，宋泊先生提议作石膏模型，并捐出了二百斤石膏作增产基金。王之英先生提出造解剖模型、画大像等。大家想出了很多办法，保证今后要努力增产捐献飞机大炮，支援志愿军提早把美国鬼子赶出朝鲜去。
