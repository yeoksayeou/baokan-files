　　The All-China Textile Workers' Union donates 4.5 billion yuan from surplus funds to purchase a squadron of "China Textile Workers" fighter planes. The Standing Committee of the All-China Textile Workers' Union passed a resolution regarding this donation and was unanimously approved by the chairmen's meetings of regional, provincial, and municipal committees nationwide. The All-China Textile Workers' Union calls on textile workers nationwide to highly promote the glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle and patriotism, immediately and consciously take action, universally establish patriotic pacts, launch a patriotic production increase and weapon donation campaign, and do a good job in providing preferential treatment.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th. Li Shunda Mutual Aid Team, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model, actively responds to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for Resistance Against America and Aiding Korea to launch a donation campaign, and suggests to farmers throughout Shanxi Province to donate "Patriotic Bumper Harvest" and "New China Farmer" aircraft.
    Upon hearing the news of the Chinese People's Committee for Resistance Against America and Aiding Korea's call for donating aircraft and cannons, Li Shunda immediately mobilized all team members to discuss it. Every member fully recognized the significance of this great call and unanimously decided to first donate a portion from their existing surplus grain and then continue to donate from increased grain production. At the meeting, they also passed a proposal to farmers throughout the province, suggesting launching a competition to donate "Patriotic Bumper Harvest" and "New China Farmer" aircraft. Currently, all members of the Li Shunda team are considering revising their patriotic pact to further improve farming techniques, realize the patriotic bumper harvest competition plan, increase agricultural and sideline income, achieve regular and fixed-amount donations, and treat the families of martyrs and servicemen with preferential care.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 10th. The Han En Mutual Aid Team, a special-class agricultural labor model in Jilin Province, responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee for Resistance Against America and Aiding Korea, and challenged mutual aid teams across the country, as well as agricultural labor models in various provinces, counties, and districts.
    The terms of the challenge are: (1) All 27 households in the team must seize the opportunity to do a good job in agricultural and sideline production, increase income from various sources, and donate 5.07 million yuan (of which Han En donates 1 million yuan) to purchase aircraft and cannons to support the front lines. (2) Guarantee to conscientiously and regularly help the families of martyrs, servicemen, and disabled veterans who have relatively difficult lives, so that their living standards are not lower than the level of all team members; in summer hoeing, ensure that the families of martyrs and servicemen receive four hoeings and four weedings, and strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn.

    李顺达建议山西省农民捐献飞机两架
    【本报讯】中国纺织工会全国委员会捐献节余经费四十五亿元，购买“中国纺织工人号”战斗机一小队。该会全国委员会常委会通过了关于此项捐献的决议，并经全国各地区、省、市委员会主席会议一致同意。纺织工会全国委员会号召全国纺织工人要高度发挥反帝斗争和爱国主义的光荣传统，立即自觉自愿地行动起来，普遍订立爱国公约，展开爱国增产捐献武器运动，并做好优抚工作。
    【新华社太原十日电】全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达互助组，积极响应中国人民抗美援朝总会关于开展捐献运动的号召，向山西全省农民建议捐献“爱国丰产号”和“新中国农民号”飞机。
    李顺达在听到抗美援朝总会号召捐献飞机大炮的消息后，立即发动全组组员进行讨论。每个组员充分认识这一伟大号召的意义，一致决定先从现有余粮中捐献一部，再从增产粮食中继续捐献。他们在会上又通过了向全省农民提出建议书，建议开展捐献“爱国丰产”和“新中国农民”号飞机的竞赛运动。现在李顺达组全体组员正在酝酿修正自己的爱国公约，要进一步提高耕作技术，实现爱国丰产竞赛计划，增加农业、副业收入，做到定期定额捐献，优待烈士家属和军人家属。
    【新华社吉林十日电】吉林省特等农业劳动模范韩恩互助组，响应抗美援朝总会的号召，向全国各地互助组及各省、县、区农业劳动模范们挑战。
    排战的条件是：（一）全组二十七户要抓紧做好农业和副业生产，从多方面增加收入，捐献五百零七万元（其中韩恩捐一百万元）购买飞机、大炮，支援前线。（二）保证做到认真、经常地帮助生活较困难的烈属、军属和荣誉军人，使他们的生活水平不低于全体组员的水平；在夏锄中保证给烈属、军属做到四铲四趟，争取秋后丰收。
