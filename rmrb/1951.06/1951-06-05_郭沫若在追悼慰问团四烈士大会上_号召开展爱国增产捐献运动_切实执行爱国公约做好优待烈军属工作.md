Xinhua News Agency, June 4th—Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China People's 抗美援朝 General Association, made a speech at the memorial meeting held by people from all walks of life in the capital to mourn the glorious sacrifice of the four martyrs of the China People's Delegation to Korea. Here are excerpts: The sacrifice of the four martyrs is glorious. The martyrs have fulfilled their greatest responsibility. Their hard work has encouraged the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people, and it has also encouraged all of us Chinese people; and their glorious sacrifice has given us even greater encouragement.

Today, our people in the capital are mourning the four martyrs, and we must swear to the four martyrs that we must actively support the call of the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, conscientiously and universally promote patriotic pledges, launch a movement to donate airplanes and cannons, and do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel.

Regarding patriotic pledges, we must not only universally establish them, but also conscientiously implement them. To ensure universal establishment, we must, in addition to the patriotic pledges within a large scope, establish specific pledges with small units as the scope. To ensure effective implementation, the clauses must be practical, specific and concise, revised at any time, and inspected regularly.

Regarding the movement to donate airplanes and cannons, the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association has suggested to us that we, regardless of men, women, old, or young, should launch a patriotic movement to increase production and increase income, and use part or all of the newly increased income for donations. The donated airplanes, cannons, tanks, etc., will be named after the donating unit as a glorious memorial. This is a very good method. Relying on increased production to donate is not asking us to take flesh to mend sores, but to add flowers to the brocade, killing two birds with one stone. The martyrs have donated their lives, can't we launch a patriotic increase production donation movement? Yes, we must enthusiastically donate and launch competitions to win the first place in donating airplanes, the first place in donating cannons, and the first place in donating tanks.

Regarding preferential treatment for the families of martyrs and military personnel, we must give preferential treatment to the families of all the martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves on the Korean front, and we must give preferential treatment to the families of all revolutionary military personnel. Today, the families of the four martyrs are in front of us, and we Beijing citizens should express our sincerity in mourning the four martyrs with practical actions to give preferential treatment to the families of the four martyrs. Today, many public security armed comrades and People's Liberation Army soldiers are guarding the safety of our capital, so we should first express our respect to them, and we should also give preferential treatment to the families of these comrades with practical actions.

In addition to this, we should also try to meet the urgent medical needs of the front. We should mobilize patriotic doctors to work more enthusiastically at the front, and we should especially encourage privately practicing doctors to go to the front or actively participate in public medical work.

In addition to medicine, the front also urgently needs nutritious food and spiritual food. For the supply of material food, we can expand the donation movement, especially donating more cash, and hand it over to the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association for unified management. As for spiritual food, cultural workers, especially literary and art workers, should produce more. Among the four martyrs we mourn today, Chang Baokun and Cheng Shutang were patriotic people's artists, and our literary and art workers should take them as models. We must take the promotion of patriotic ideological education as our lofty theme, create more excellent works, praise our revolutionary new heroism, strengthen our belief in winning the war to resist America, enhance our fighting will and production enthusiasm, to meet the needs of the front and the needs of national defense construction and economic construction.

Comrades, there are many aspects in which we can contribute our patriotic enthusiasm. Under the great banner of patriotism, standing at our posts, we will strive to contribute all our enthusiasm. In this way, we can strive for the final victory of the war to resist America, consolidate our motherland, break the US imperialist aggression policy, and defend world peace. This is the best step for us to commemorate the four martyrs and learn from the four martyrs.

　　郭沫若在追悼慰问团四烈士大会上
    号召开展爱国增产捐献运动
    切实执行爱国公约做好优待烈军属工作
    【新华社四日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若在首都各界人民追悼中国人民赴朝慰问团光荣牺牲四烈士大会上讲话摘要：四位烈士的牺牲是光荣的。烈士们是尽了最大的责任的。他们的努力工作鼓励了中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民，也鼓励了我们全体中国人民；而他们的光荣牺牲对于我们的鼓励更大。
    今天我们首都人民追悼四位烈士，就要向四位烈士宣誓，我们一定要积极拥护中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，切实普遍推行爱国公约，发动捐献飞机大炮运动，做好优待烈士家属、军人家属工作。
    关于爱国公约，我们不仅要普遍订立，而且要切实执行。要保证普遍订立，就必须在大范围内的爱国公约之外，再以小单位为范围而订立具体的公约。要保证切实执行，就必须使条文切合实际，具体简明，随时修补，定期检查。
    关于捐献飞机大炮的运动，抗美援朝总会已向我们建议：要我们不分男女老少，都开展爱国的增加生产、增加收入运动，用新增加的收入的一部分或全部拿来捐献。捐献的飞机、大炮、坦克等将冠以捐献单位的名字，作为光荣的纪念。这是一个很好的办法，靠增产来捐献，不是要我们剜肉补疮，而是要我们锦上添花，一举两得。烈士们把他们的生命捐献出来了，难道我们就不能展开爱国增产捐献运动吗？能够的，我们一定要热烈地捐献，并展开竞赛，争取到捐献飞机的第一号，捐献大炮的第一号，捐献坦克的第一号。
    关于优待烈属军属，我们要优待在朝鲜前线英勇捐躯的所有烈士的家属，我们要优待所有革命军人家属。今天四位烈士的家属就在我们面前，我们北京市民就应以优待四位烈士家属的实际行动来表示我们追悼四位烈士的诚意。今天有不少的公安武装同志和人民解放军在拱卫我们首都的安全，我们就应该先向他们表示敬意，我们就应该同样以实际的行动来优待这些同志们的家属。
    除此以外，我们还应设法满足前方迫切需要的医药。我们应当发动爱国的大夫们更踊跃地到前方去工作，我们应该特别鼓励私人开业的大夫们到前方去或者踊跃地参加公家的医疗工作。
    除医药外，前方还迫切需要富于营养的食品和精神食粮。对于物质食粮的供应，我们可以扩大捐献运动，特别是多捐现款，交由抗美援朝总会统筹办理。至于精神食粮，就要文化工作者、特别是文艺工作者多多生产。我们今天所追悼的四位烈士当中，常宝坤和程树棠二烈士就是爱国的人民艺术家，我们的文艺工作者们就应当以他们为模范。我们要以推广爱国主义的思想教育作为我们崇高的主题，多多创作些优秀的作品，来表扬我们革命的新英雄主义，加强我们抗美战争必胜的信念，提高我们的战斗意志和生产热情，来满足前方的需要和国防建设、经济建设各方面的需要。
    同志们，我们能够贡献出自己的爱国热诚的方面是很多的。我们在爱国主义的大旗下，站在自己的岗位上，努力贡献出自己的全部热诚。这样来争取抗美战争的最后胜利，来巩固我们的祖国，来打破美帝国主义的侵略政策，保卫世界和平。这就是我们纪念四位烈士、学习四位烈士的最好的步骤。
