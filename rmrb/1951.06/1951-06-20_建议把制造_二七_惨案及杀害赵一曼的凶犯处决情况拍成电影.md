　　Suggestion to Film the Execution of the Culprits Who Created the "February 7th" Massacre and Murdered Zhao Yiman
Editor:
　　The People's Daily published on June 14th the news that Zhao Jixian, the bandit criminal who created the "February 7th" Massacre, and Wu Shugui, the chief culprit who helped the Japanese bandits cruelly murder our Northeast Anti-Japanese hero Comrade Zhao Yiman during the puppet Manchurian era, had been captured. We were truly delighted to see this. This shows that all counter-revolutionary elements who owe the people blood debts will never escape the giant palm of the people.
    We demand that the government severely punish bandit criminal Zhao Jixian and bandit criminal Wu Shugui, and suggest that relevant authorities film the handling of these two criminals separately and screen them in various locations. The newsreel reporting the handling of Wu Shugui is best attached to the end of the film Zhao Yiman, so that everyone can see how the murderers of the martyrs met their end.

　　建议把制造“二七”惨案及杀害赵一曼的凶犯处决情况拍成电影编辑同志：
    人民日报六月十四日刊出了制造“二七”惨案的凶犯赵匪继贤，和伪满时代帮助日寇残杀我东北抗日英雄赵一曼同志的主谋凶犯吴匪树桂就擒的消息。我们看了，真是高兴极了。这说明，一切欠了人民血债的反革命分子，决逃不出人民的巨掌。
    我们要求政府严惩赵匪继贤及吴匪树桂，并建议有关机关将处理该两凶犯的情况分别拍成电影，在各地放映。报导吴匪树桂处理情况的新闻片最好附加在电影赵一曼的后面，让大家看到残杀烈士的凶手是怎样下场的。
