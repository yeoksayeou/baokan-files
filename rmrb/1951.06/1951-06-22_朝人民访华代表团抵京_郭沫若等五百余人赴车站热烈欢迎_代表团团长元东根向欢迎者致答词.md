Those who came to the station to welcome them included: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; Liao Chengzhi, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea; Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, including Xing Xiping, Cai Tingkai, Shi Liang, Huang Yanpei, Xu Guangping, Peng Zemin, Situ Meitang, Zhang Xiruo, Zhu Xuefan, Mao Dun, Liang Xi, Rong Gaotang, Zeng Xianzhi, Xie Bangding, and representatives from all sectors of the capital, totaling over 500 people.

Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, and personnel from the embassy were also present at the station to welcome the delegation.

The Korean People's Delegation, accompanied by Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, who had gone to Andong to greet the delegation, stepped off the train and, amidst enthusiastic applause, accepted flowers presented by the Young Pioneers. Subsequently, a brief welcoming ceremony was held at the station.

Guo Moruo delivered a welcoming speech, expressing a warm welcome to the Korean People's Delegation. He said: The people of China and Korea have always been friendly brotherly nations, and now they are fighting shoulder to shoulder against the U.S. aggressors, making them even more closely linked. The entire Chinese people are currently deeply engaged in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, donating airplanes and cannons to support the Korean front lines. The arrival of the Korean People's Delegation will greatly encourage our people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and further strengthen the militant friendship between the people of China and Korea.

Liao Chengzhi said in his welcoming speech: After returning to China, the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea is going to all parts of the country to tell the people about the heroic deeds of the Korean people. The arrival of the Korean People's Delegation in China will show them that the Chinese people stand firmly with the Korean people. By uniting and fighting together, the people of China and Korea will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors in the end.

Won Dong-geun, the head of the Korean People's Delegation, delivered a reply. The welcoming ceremony ended in a warm atmosphere.

(Xinhua News Agency, June 21st) The full text of the speech by Won Dong-geun, head of the Korean People's Delegation, is as follows: Dear Comrades:

Our Korean People's Delegation, entrusted by all the Korean people, feels infinite joy and honor to visit the great neighboring country, the People's Republic of China!

Especially as we enter Beijing, the capital of the great People's Republic of China, we express our utmost respect with boundless excitement, on behalf of all the Korean people, to Chairman Mao Zedong, the founder of the great People's Republic of China and the great leader of the Chinese people! We also express our warm gratitude to all the representatives of the people of Beijing who came to welcome us, and to Chairman Guo and Head Liao!

This delegation is warmly entrusted by all the Korean people to convey the heartfelt gratitude of the Korean people for all the support that the Chinese people have provided since the American imperialists invaded Korea. We also want to further consolidate the traditional friendship between the people of Korea and China.

At the most critical moment of the Korean people's war of liberation against the aggression of American imperialism, the Chinese people sent the People's Volunteer Army to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, giving the enemy devastating blows. Moreover, in the vast rear areas of China, a mass movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country was enthusiastically launched, continuously providing material and spiritual support and encouragement for us to march towards victory. We Korean people will never forget this great international friendship.

Although the American imperialists have slaughtered and humiliated our innocent people on our territory, and turned many cities and villages of our motherland into ashes, and even used bacteriological weapons and other cruel and inhumane acts to persecute us, the enemy's result is just the opposite. The Korean people have not only not succumbed, but are even more filled with a strong will to fight the enemy without fear of sacrifice and with love for the motherland, and are determined to achieve final victory!

Dear Comrades! We Korean people firmly believe that with the moral support of the peace-loving people of the world, and especially with the backing of our Chinese brothers, the anti-American war will surely achieve final victory!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live General Kim Il-sung, the most beloved leader of the Korean people and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the savior of the liberation of all small and weak nations in the world, and our dearest friend!

Long live the friendship and unity forged in blood between the Korean and Chinese people!

    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团受全朝鲜人民的委派，访问伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国，感到无限的欢喜和光荣！
    尤其当我们步入伟大的中华人民共和国的首都北京之际，我们以无限兴奋的心情，代表全朝鲜人民谨向伟大的中华人民共和国政府的创建者，也就是中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席致以最崇高的敬意！并向前来欢迎我们的北京市全体人民代表和郭主席、廖团长致以热烈的谢意！

    中国人民在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的祖国解放战争最紧急的时候，派来人民志愿部队，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，予敌人以歼灭性的打击，而且在中国的广大后方，热烈地展开了抗美援朝保家卫国的群众运动，在物质上和精神上不断地支援和鼓舞我们走向胜利。这种伟大的国际友爱，我们朝鲜人民将永世不忘。
    美帝国主义虽在我们的疆土上屠杀与侮辱我们无辜的人民，并使祖国许多的城市和农村化为灰烬，甚至使用细菌武器等种种惨无人道的行为来迫害我们。但敌人所得的结果却正相反，朝鲜人民不但没有屈服，反而更充满着不怕牺牲和热爱祖国的坚强意志，来与敌人斗争，并坚决地要取得最后胜利！
    亲爱的同志们！我们朝鲜人民深信有全世界爱好和平人民的道义支援，和特别是中国人民弟兄们作后盾的反美战争，必定能获得最后胜利！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民最敬爱的领袖，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成将军万岁！
    全世界弱小民族解放的救星，最亲爱的朋友斯大林大元帅万岁！
    朝鲜人民与中国人民以血凝成的友谊与团结万岁！
