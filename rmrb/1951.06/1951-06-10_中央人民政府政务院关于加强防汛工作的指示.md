　　The serious floods of 1949 caused significant damage to agricultural production and the safety of some transportation and industry in vast areas of our country. To overcome this natural disaster, considerable water conservancy projects have been carried out nationwide in the spring of 1950 and 1951. In 1950, except for the Huai River basin, which still suffered serious disasters due to excessive flooding, most areas achieved significant results. However, due to the long-term stagnation and destruction of various construction undertakings during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the restoration and development of our water conservancy construction must go through a considerable process. Therefore, the threat of floods cannot be completely eliminated in the short term. Now that the major flood season for rivers across the country is approaching, and some rivers in the Pearl River and Yangtze River basins have already entered the flood season, the people in relevant areas across the country should mobilize and fight to overcome floods. The leading organs in relevant areas should regard this work as an important political task and ensure its completion. Based on past experience, the following issues are raised, and it is hoped that people's governments at all levels will study and implement them in detail.

　　I. Strengthen leadership organizations and closely connect upstream and downstream areas and adjacent sections: Flood control work is a mass undertaking, and leadership organs must connect with the broad masses to do this work well. The organization of flood control leading organs at all levels should be based on the experience of last year, with local people's governments as the main body, led by the administrative heads, with water conservancy organs handling daily operations, and inviting representatives from local military units and other relevant organs and groups to participate, to form a unified leading organ to strengthen leadership. In areas with river basin water conservancy organs, basin-wide command organs can be established according to specific circumstances to provide unified leadership, or water conservancy organs can participate in the flood control organizations in their respective areas, responsible for grasping water conditions, guiding technology, and connecting upstream and downstream areas. For the defense of areas adjacent to districts and provinces, special attention must be paid to strengthening consultation to resolve existing problems, pre-dividing embankment sections, clarifying defense responsibilities, or establishing joint defense mechanisms, to ensure unified leadership, segmented responsibility, close connection between upstream and downstream areas, and mutual support between left and right banks, to achieve the victorious completion of the task.

　　II. Organize the masses and do a good job of pre-flood preparations: Flood control work is related to the vital interests of the masses, and relying on the masses is the basic guarantee for doing this work well. Therefore, all areas must conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization among the people along the rivers, establish basic organizations for patrolling embankments and emergency rescue based on specific circumstances, and have the necessary reserve forces, and enable the masses to master the general technology of flood control and emergency rescue. At the same time, the progress of the work should be checked at any time, or exercises should be held during agricultural slack periods to overcome the phenomenon of being unrealistic and not thorough. Last year, the assistance of the People's Liberation Army in various places played a great role in rescuing rivers. This year, we should warmly welcome the strong support of the troops stationed in various places for this work. Emergency and unexpected situations often occur during flood control. The materials, equipment, transportation, etc. necessary for emergency rescue should be prepared in advance to avoid temporary difficulties.

　　III. Inspect dikes and sluices, eliminate hidden dangers, and strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents: Dike projects are the material basis for flood control work. According to past experience, dike failures are due to excessive flooding and the river channel cannot contain the overflow. However, there are not a few cases where collapses occur before the flood reaches the full channel. To strengthen defense and ensure safety, water conservancy organs at all levels should conduct serious completion inspections of the newly built defense works this year to meet engineering standards. For existing dikes, a mass dike inspection should be launched to thoroughly eliminate hidden dangers or defects such as badger holes, snake holes, rat holes, ant nests, ditches, erosion pits, and road crossings. Local sluice projects, due to improper construction or disrepair over the years, often become serious weaknesses in flood control work. Personnel should be organized to conduct responsible inspections, establish management systems, and strengthen their leadership. All the above inspection work is very important. Responsible personnel at all levels should personally inspect important projects. During the flood season, any damage to dike projects may cause major disasters. Therefore, a high degree of vigilance should be maintained against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and strict precautions should be taken.

　　IV. Improve predictability, and prevent paralysis and carelessness: To improve predictability and make flood control work proactive, water conservancy organs at all levels should, on the one hand, improve flood reporting organizations, strengthen the measurement, reporting, analysis, and research of rainfall and hydrology, and conduct flood forecasting as much as possible, so as to grasp changes in water conditions and make arrangements in advance. On the other hand, attention should also be paid to studying changes in river conditions in important sections, and necessary measures should be taken in a timely manner.

　　River accidents often occur in unexpected floods. Therefore, throughout the flood season, vigilance must be maintained, and any negligence or slackness must be opposed. Last year, many provinces and regions lacked rain in early summer, and the masses were busy fighting drought, and were not adequately prepared for flood control. Floods came suddenly and defenses were inadequate, resulting in disasters. It should be known that drought followed by flooding has been a common occurrence for many years. Therefore, in all river basins across the country, once the flood season arrives, there is always the possibility of heavy rain. Therefore, even if individual areas lack rainfall, flood control work should not be taken lightly. In particular, dike breaches often occur in the deep of night during storms. Flood control dike patrol personnel must stick to their posts day and night to prevent accidents.

　　V. Resolutely guarantee the completion of tasks and make advance plans for abnormal floods: To clarify goals and strengthen responsibilities, flood control tasks in various places this year have been proposed by water conservancy organs in various regions and river basins based on the water conditions and defense capabilities of each river, and the guarantee is both necessary and possible. This is the minimum task that must be completed, and the people and government organs across the country should jointly guarantee its successful completion. In addition, to prevent abnormal floods from causing huge disasters, for rivers where flood threats are particularly serious and fundamental control projects have not yet been completed, countermeasures should be prepared in advance for possible abnormal situations to reduce disasters, and reported to the leading organs for research and decision.

### 中央人民政府政务院关于加强防汛工作的指示

　　中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强防汛工作的指示
    一九四九年的严重水灾，对我国广大地区的农业生产及部分交通和工业的安全，曾经发生过重大危害。为了克服这种自然灾害，一九五零年和一九五一年的春季，在全国范围内已经进行了相当巨大的水利工程。在一九五零年，除去淮河流域，因为洪水过大，仍然发生严重灾害以外，多数地区收到显著成绩；但是由于国民党反动统治时期各种建设事业长期的停滞和破坏，我们水利建设的恢复和发展，还必须经过一个相当的过程，因而在短期内还不能完全免除洪水的威胁。现在全国河流大汛将至，珠江流域和长江流域的一部分河流并已进入汛期，全国有关地区的人民即应动员起来，为战胜洪水而奋斗。有关地区的领导机关，都应把这一工作看做一件重要的政治任务，保证完成。兹根据过去经验，提出以下几个问题，望各级人民政府具体研究执行。
    一、加强领导机构，密切上下游及邻接地段的联系：防汛工作是群众性的工作，领导机关必须联系广大群众，才能做好这一工作。各级防汛领导机构的组织，应当根据去年的经验，以地方人民政府为主体，由行政首长负责领导，由水利机关办理日常业务，并邀请当地驻军代表和其他有关机关团体参加，组织统一的领导机构，以加强领导的力量。在设有流域水利机关的地区，可以根据具体情况，设立流域性指挥机关，统一领导，或由水利机关分别参加所在地区的防汛机构工作，负责掌握水情，指导技术及上下游间相互的联系工作。对于区省邻接地带的防守，尤须注意加强协商解决存在的问题，预先划分堤段，明确防守责任，或者建立联防机构，务期切实做到统一领导、分段负责、上下游密切联系、左右岸互相支援，以求胜利完成任务。
    二、组织群众，并做好汛前准备工作：防汛工作关系群众切身的利益，依靠群众，是做好这一工作的基本保证，所以各个地区对沿河群众，必须深入进行宣传动员，根据具体情况，建立巡堤抢险的基干组织，和必要的后备力量，并使群众掌握防汛抢险的一般技术。同时要随时检查进行的情况，或利用农隙举行演习，以克服不切实不深入的现象。去年各地人民解放军的协助，对于各河抢险，起了很大的作用，今年仍应热烈欢迎各地驻军大力支持这一工作。防汛当中经常发生紧急意外的情况，对于抢险必需的物料、设备、交通工具等，尤应事先准备，以免临时发生困难。
    三、检查堤防、涵闸，消灭隐患，并严防土匪特务破坏：堤防工事是防汛工作的物质基础。根据过去的经验，堤防出险，固有由于洪水过大，河槽不能容泄因而漫溢者，但是洪水尚未满槽，即行溃决者亦不在少。为了加强防御，保证安全，对于今年新修的防御工事，各级水利机关应当认真进行竣工检验，以求合于工程标准；对于旧有堤防，则应发动群众性的堤防大检查，以求彻底消灭獾洞、蛇洞、鼠穴、蚁穴、水沟、跌窝、道口等等的隐患或缺陷；各地涵闸工程，或因建筑不当，或因年久失修，往往成为防汛工作中的严重弱点，应组织人员做负责的检查，建立管理制度，并加强其领导。以上各项检查工作，均甚重要。对重要工程各级负责人员应亲自检查。在汛期中，对堤防工事的任何破坏，都可能造成重大灾害，因之对反革命分子的破坏活动，尤应提起高度警惕，严加防范。
    四、提高预见性，防止麻痹大意：为了提高预见性，使防汛工作取得主动，各级水利机关，一方面应健全报汛组织，加强雨量水文的测报和分析研究工作，并尽可能进行洪水预报，期能掌握水情的变化，预作布置。另一面，对于重要地段的河势变化，亦应注意研究，及时做必要的措施。
    河流出险常常发生于意外的洪水，因此在整个汛期中，都须提高警惕，反对任何疏忽松弛。去年曾有许多省区，由于初夏缺雨，群众忙于抗旱，对防汛准备不足，洪水猝至，防御不及，因而成灾。应知先旱后涝是多年来常有的情况，因此，全国各流域，一入汛期，随时皆有发生暴雨的可能，所以个别地区，纵或雨量缺少，对防汛工作也不应轻忽。尤其是堤防溃决常常发生在狂风暴雨的深夜，防汛巡堤人员更须不分昼夜，坚守工作岗位，以防意外。
    五、切实保证完成任务，并对异常洪水预筹措施：为了明确目标，加强责任，今年各地防汛任务，已由各地区各流域水利机关，根据各河水情和防御能力，提出必须而且可能的保证，这是最低限度必须完成的任务，全国人民和政府机关应该共同保证其胜利完成。此外，为防止异常洪水造成巨大灾害，对于洪水威胁特别严重而治本工程尚未完成的河流，应针对可能发生的异常情况，预筹缩小灾害的对策，事先报请领导机关研究决定。
