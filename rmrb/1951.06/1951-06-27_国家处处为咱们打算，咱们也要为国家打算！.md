　　"The state is planning for us in every way, and we must also plan for the state!"
    By our special correspondent, Yu Jingqing
    When the cotton farmers of Houtazibu Village in Liaoyang County first heard that the government was going to mobilize the purchase and storage of cotton, some said, "It's all sold out." Some said, "There's a little bit, but I don't need the money, so I don't want to sell." Some cadres also said, "The masses are rich and want to store cotton, so it won't be easy to mobilize them." After studying the instructions of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding the purchase and storage of cotton, and the call of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the village branch of the CCP assessed the situation in the village and concluded that there must still be cotton stored in the village; as long as the message was well-promoted and the rationale explained clearly, it could all be mobilized.

    Based on this assessment and understanding, the branch mobilized all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and propagandists to go everywhere, organizing discussions among the masses and building momentum. At the village people's representative meeting on June 7th, Fu Mingxin, the secretary of the CCP branch, said, "Now we all say that we can get rich through labor, and make a fortune by growing cotton; didn't we work just as hard during the Kuomintang era? Why couldn't we make a fortune then?" This question triggered everyone's memories, and they compared their current lives with the past. Before the land reform, it was not uncommon for the old women in this village to spend the winter in thin trousers. They also grew cotton, but they couldn't afford to wear it themselves. Many people sold all their cotton, but it wasn't enough to pay rent, taxes, and buy food, so how could they wear good clothes? Now, it's completely different—from January to May this year, they bought an average of thirteen feet of cloth per person, and everyone, young and old, put on new summer clothes. Of the 243 households in the village, 284 livestock were being raised, and only 13 households didn't have any. The Xujia Natural Village only had two cows and five donkeys two years ago, but now it has more than sixty livestock. More than 10,000 catties of soybean cake have been bought in preparation for topdressing, and the loans provided by the government haven't even been counted yet.... People's representative Meng Fanzhi said excitedly, "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, the help of the People's Government, and our good country, we wouldn't be able to get rich on our own." In 1949, the People's Government called for the planting of cotton and hemp, and most people had concerns and didn't dare to plant. Communist Party members took the lead in responding to the government's call, and the village planted 300 mu of cotton. The government also provided loans for grain, fertilizer, and cotton medicine, and guaranteed prices, which ensured that those who grew cotton benefited. By 1950, everyone saw that growing cotton was profitable, so they planted more, and the village planted 550 mu, and another 120 mu of kenaf, and the benefits were even greater. Xu Yongkui had six mu of thin hillside land, all of which were planted with cotton, and he picked 300 catties of lint cotton, with an income more than eight times that of growing sorghum. Jiang Yongwen planted 1.4 mu of kenaf and harvested 340 catties, the value of which was also more than eight times that of sorghum. Everyone who responded to the call of the Party and the government benefited. Besides the People's Government and the Communist Party, who has ever sought so many benefits for us? This year, the village's 2,851 mu of land (including 187 mu of newly reclaimed paddy fields) was planted with 960 mu of cotton, 624 mu of kenaf, 324 mu of tobacco, and 530 mu of rice. If the People's Government didn't guarantee the prices of cotton, hemp, and tobacco, wouldn't these things depreciate in the future?

    People's representative Xu Enchang (a Communist Party member) continued, "The state is planning for us in every way, and we must also plan for the state. If factories lack cotton and stop work, the worker brothers will have no work to do, and in the future, a shortage of cloth and price fluctuations will also be detrimental to us farmers. The affairs of the state are also our own affairs. I still have sixty catties of lint cotton, and I have decided to hand it over to the state for storage." Fu Mingxin, the secretary of the CCP branch, said, "My cotton is all sold, but my daughter still has twenty catties of lint cotton, and I guarantee to mobilize her to sell it to the state." Farmer Xu said, "Young men can join the Volunteer Army to resist America and aid Korea, so I'll also let the cotton go out to love the country." As a result, everyone rushed to sign up, reporting more than 300 catties on the spot.

　　“国家处处为咱们打算，咱们也要为国家打算！”
    本报特约记者  于镜清
    辽阳县后达子堡村的棉农开始听说政府要动员购棉、储棉时，有的人说：“都卖光了。”有的人说：“多少有一点，不用钱，不想卖。”有的干部也说：“群众富了，想存棉，不容易动员出来。”中共村支部委员会研究了中央人民政府政务院关于购棉、储棉的指示和中共中央的号召后，估计了一下本村的情况，认为：本村肯定还有存棉；只要好好宣传，讲清道理，就可以全部动员出来。
    基于这种估计与认识，支部便发动所有共产党员、青年团员、宣传员到处活动起来，组织群众讨论，酝酿。六月七日召开村人民代表大会，中共支部书记富明新说：“现在咱们都说劳动致富，种棉发家；国民党时代咱们不是一样的劳动吗？为什么那时不能发家呢？”这一问引起了大家的回忆，纷纷以现在的生活和过去比较起来。土地改革以前，这村的老娘儿们穿着单裤过冬不算稀罕事情。他们也种棉花，但是轮不上自己穿。许多人卖光了棉花，不够交租交税买粮食，那儿能穿好的？如今呢，完全不同了——从今年一月到五月，平均每人买了十三尺布，老老少少都换上了新单衣。全村二百四十三户，喂着二百八十四头牲口，没有牲口的只有十三户了。徐家自然屯两年前只有两头牛，五个毛驴，现在有六十多头牲口了。准备上追肥的豆饼，已买进一万多斤，政府贷给的还没算……。人民代表孟凡之激动地说：“要是没有共产党领导，没有人民政府帮助，没有咱们这个好国家，光咱们是发不了家的。”一九四九年人民政府号召种棉、麻，多数人有顾虑，不敢种。共产党员首先带头响应政府号召，全村种了三百亩棉花。政府又贷粮、贷肥料、贷棉药，保证价格，这才使种棉花的都得了利。到一九五○年，大家看到种棉有利，纷纷多种，全村种到五百五十亩，又种洋麻一百二十亩，得利就更多了。徐永奎有六亩山坡薄地，都种了棉花，拣了三百斤皮棉，收入超过种高粱八倍。姜永文种了一亩四分洋麻，收了三百四十斤，价值也超过高粱八倍。凡是响应党和政府号召的人，都沾了光。除了人民政府和共产党，谁给咱们谋过这么多的利益？今年全村的二千八百五十一亩地（内有新开荒的水田一百八十七亩），种了九百六十亩棉花，六百二十四亩洋麻，三百二十四亩烟草，五百三十亩水稻。如果不是人民政府保证了棉麻烟的价格，这些东西以后能够不跌价吗？
    人民代表徐恩常（共产党员）接着说：“国家处处为咱们打算，咱们也要为国家打算。工厂里缺棉停工，工人兄弟没活干，将来缺少布匹物价波动对咱农民也不利。国家的事也是咱们自己的事。我还有六十斤皮棉，我决定交给国家储存。”中共支部书记富明新说：“我的棉都卖了，我女儿还有二十斤皮棉，我保证动员她卖给国家。”农民徐老头说：“青年小伙子能参加志愿军去抗美援朝，我也叫棉花出去爱国吧。”这一来，大家争先恐后地自报起来，当场就报了三百多斤。
