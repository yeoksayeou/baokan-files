　　The Immortal Man
     ——Remembering Liu Jingzhou, the Railway Worker Who Gave His Life to Protect Ammunition Vehicles and Bridges in Support of Korea
    Li Keyi
    In early April, at night, I walked more than thirty li to a station, arriving after two o'clock in the morning. The station's military representative sent me to a Korean peasant's home where the station staff lodged, to rest.

    On the kang (a traditional Chinese brick bed), two station staff members were sleeping, off-duty. I put down my backpack, squeezed in between them, covered myself with my coat, and lay down.

    "Niao Yue?" one of them, with his back to me, turned his face and asked.

    I understood the meaning of this Korean phrase. He was asking who I was.

    "China Shelami," I said, "I am Chinese." I wanted to exchange a few more polite words with him, but I didn't know how.

    Unexpectedly, this person chuckled. He turned over and said:

    "I am also China Shelami, my name is Liu Jingzhou."

    In the dim light of the gas lamp, I saw that this person was a young man with a clean-shaven head and a cheerful expression, at most twenty-three or twenty-four years old.

    That's how I met Liu Jingzhou.

    The next morning, the two of us sat on the hillside behind the house, basking in the sun and talking. From our conversation, I learned that Liu Jingzhou was among the first group of Chinese railway workers to volunteer to support Korea by crossing the river. Moreover, he was one of the first to go. In China, he was a car number checker at a station near the Tumen River. Now, at this station in Korea, he was still working as a car number checker.

    The night before he crossed the river, his wife gave birth to a lovely boy in the railway hospital. However, the first Korean he saw when he set foot on the Korean border was the bloody corpse of an infant who had been bombed to death by American planes.

    He said: "At that time, I couldn't stop my tears and felt extremely sad. How I hated it! - From that moment on, I understood even more why we were resisting America and aiding Korea, and why resisting America and aiding Korea meant protecting our homes and defending our country..."

    Then, as if talking about everyday matters, he told me a story about his time in Korea. Although he told the story in a very ordinary way, I was deeply moved. I found in Liu Jingzhou the image of millions of Chinese people volunteering to support Korea. They were all bravely performing many amazing deeds.
      ×                        ×                      ×
    On the afternoon of March 20th, when enemy planes came to bomb the station, Liu Jingzhou demonstrated the most noble and outstanding spirit of the working class. Enemy planes dropped dozens of time bombs in the station. After the enemy planes left, it was already dark, and the time bombs continued to explode in the station. Soil, stones, railroad ties, and shrapnel flew in the thick smoke of the explosions. The sky above the station was filled with smoke. The houses on both sides of the station had already caught fire. However, all our railway workers and Korean workers fearlessly emerged from their hiding places and entered the station engulfed in smoke and fire. Because everyone knew that our military transportation could not be interrupted even for a single night, or even an hour. That night, a train carrying wounded soldiers was scheduled to arrive, and two important trains were scheduled to depart. Everyone understood that we must get our wounded comrades to the rear to recuperate as quickly as possible, so that our brave warriors could recover soon and return to the front line to kill those American bandits! We must get our ammunition and food to the front as quickly as possible, so that our artillery would have enough shells and our brave warriors would be well-fed, and we could eliminate the American aggressors in Korea as soon as possible. - Our Chinese and Korean railway workers deeply understood how important their responsibility was. Could the terror of time bombs eliminate our workers' sense of responsibility to the war and the motherland? There would never be such a bomb in the world! Under the blockade of the time bombs, our track workers repaired the lines; our electrical workers repaired the telephone lines; our station workers rushed to transport the trains... At this time, Liu Jingzhou discovered two time bombs weighing about twenty or thirty kilograms on the ninth track in the station. If they were allowed to explode, this line would be unusable. With them on the tracks, trains could not run. Liu Jingzhou's heart burned like fire. He immediately told the station's Communist Party branch secretary that he wanted to carry away these two time bombs. His resolute attitude in requesting to take on this task made it impossible for the branch secretary to stop him. At this time, six or seven workers had already dug the time bombs out of the ballast by hand. When Liu Jingzhou saw this, he immediately carried the time bombs on his shoulders and ran out of the station in the dark. More than ten minutes later, people in the station heard a muffled explosion. Everyone worried: Liu Jingzhou was finished. However, our Liu Jingzhou ran back safely! He and the other few people went to dig out another time bomb. After it was dug out, everyone抢着 (a kind of fighting to be the one) wanted to carry it away. Liu Jingzhou pushed everyone away and said:

    "I've already made 'friends' with these guys, they won't explode on me, I'll do it!" Saying that, he carried the second time bomb away again and threw it outside the station.

    After listening to the story, I asked Liu Jingzhou why he could do that. He took out a small notebook from his pocket and pointed out a few sentences he had written for me to read:

    "Chairman Mao, when I think of you, I am not afraid of anything. For you, I am willing to do anything!" - This is what he wrote when he had just crossed the Yalu River.

    Sitting on the hillside, Liu Jingzhou's young, cheerful face was reddened by the early spring sunshine of Korea. He told me:

    "I am a Communist Party member." - When he said this, he showed great solemnity and pride.

    However, I never expected that this would be the last sentence I heard Liu Jingzhou say.
      ×                    ×                  ×
    More than half a month later, one day at noon, I returned from the front and arrived at that station again. I did not see Liu Jingzhou.

    In the evening, I stayed with the station's military representative. He told me that Liu Jingzhou had gloriously sacrificed himself in the great cause of resisting America and aiding Korea.

    Not far from the station, there was a large river. The river bridge was more than one hundred meters long, and crossing the bridge led to a mountain tunnel. The slope of the river bridge was very steep, and the slope from the river bridge to the mountain tunnel was also very steep. More than half a month ago, enemy planes had bombed and damaged one span of this river bridge, but it was immediately repaired. The morning after the repair, before dawn, a locomotive was pushing a train of ammunition cars across the bridge to hide in the mountain tunnel. Because the tracks were in bad condition, five cars in the middle of the train derailed. Dawn is when enemy planes harass the most. So the locomotive had to pull some of the cars back. The remaining ten or more cars were left on the river bridge. However, the ammunition cars could not be left on the bridge like that, waiting for enemy planes to bomb them. So, the Chinese and Korean staff at the station all came out. Everyone wanted to push these ammunition cars into the mountain tunnel. They unhooked the cars and pushed them one by one. After pushing a few cars, everyone was exhausted, but no one relaxed their grip, with only one thought in their minds: "Push!" When everyone was pushing the eighth car and reached the steepest part of the slope into the mountain tunnel, several enemy planes suddenly flew in and began a frenzied strafing.

    In this serious situation, the military representative ordered the workers to disperse immediately and find places to hide, attempting to use their own strength to hold back the vehicles. But Liu Jingzhou did not leave. He and the military representative disregarded the enemy planes' strafing and used all their strength to hold back the vehicles. However, the strength of two people could not stop the vehicles from sliding down. If it was allowed to slide down the slope, then the ammunition car would shoot down the slope like an arrow, directly hitting the six ammunition cars still parked on the other end of the bridge. Those ammunition cars would immediately explode and catch fire due to the violent impact, and the bridge would inevitably be destroyed as a result. At this time, they only thought about how to avoid this from happening, and did not think about the enemy planes' frenzied strafing overhead, and even did not think that the strength of the two of them could not stop such heavy vehicles. But their strength was too small, and they could not resist the vehicles from sliding down. At this time, the workers hiding on the hillside were anxiously shouting, but before they had time to run back, Liu Jingzhou had already blocked the vehicles. He sacrificed his own life, so that other workers were not harmed by the enemy planes' strafing, protected the military representative, protected seven ammunition cars, and protected the bridge.

    No one present will ever forget that magnificent scene: when Liu Jingzhou discovered that the vehicles were sliding down, he hurriedly used a crowbar to insert under the vehicles, wanting to stop them, but the vehicles were too heavy, and the crowbar could not withstand them. At this time, they only saw Liu Jingzhou push the military representative off the tracks, shouting loudly:

    "You are important..."

    Before he could finish speaking, Liu Jingzhou had already pressed his own body onto the crowbar... In this way, Liu Jingzhou used his own body to block the ammunition car!

    If anyone wants to ask: Why could Liu Jingzhou do this? I think, we can use the last sentence he said to me to answer:

    "I am a Communist Party member."

    If anyone wants to ask: What did Liu Jingzhou think about when he was doing this? I think, we can use the words he wrote in his notebook to answer:

    "Chairman Mao, for you, I am willing to do everything!"

    In the face of death, Liu Jingzhou thought of the motherland, thought of Chairman Mao, and thought of the Korean people who were being ravaged by American imperialism. Liu Jingzhou is the glory of our motherland, the glory of the Chinese working class, and the glory of the Chinese people.

    Among our volunteer railway workers who are fighting in Korea to aid Korea, there are many noble and brave people like Liu Jingzhou who shine with the spirit of self-sacrifice! - This is precisely one of the important reasons why victory will inevitably belong to us.

　　不朽的人
     ——记献出生命保全弹药车辆和桥梁的援朝铁路工人刘景洲
    李克异
    四月初，夜里，我步行了三十多里，来到一个车站上，已经两点多钟了。车站军事代表送我到站务员寄宿的一个朝鲜老百姓家里休息。
    炕上，有两个歇班的站务员正在睡觉。我放下背包，挤在当中，盖上大衣，躺了下来。
    “呶约？”其中背朝着我的一个转过脸来问我。
    这句朝鲜话的意思，我是懂得的。他问我是什么人。
    “中国舍拉密”我说我是中国人。想再和他客气两句，不会说了。
    不料，这人噗哧一声，笑了起来。他翻过身来，说：
    “我也是中国舍拉密，我叫刘景洲。”
    借着昏暗的瓦斯灯光，我看见这人是个头发推得光光的，有一脸愉快神情的青年，顶多二十三四岁。
    就这样，我认识了刘景洲。
    第二天上午，我们两个坐在房后的山坡上，晒着太阳谈起话来。从谈话中，我知道了刘景洲是参加第一批中国铁路职工志愿援朝大队过江的。而且，他是走在最前头的一个。在国内的时候，他是图们江边的一个车站的车号员。现在，在这个朝鲜的车站上，他仍然做车号员的工作。
    在他过江的前一天晚上，他的妻子在铁路医院里，生了一个可爱的男孩。可是，刘景洲一踏上朝鲜的边境，他看见的第一个朝鲜人，却是一具被美国飞机炸死的血肉模糊的婴儿的尸体。
    他说：“那时，我止不住我的眼泪，心里难过极了。我真恨哪！——从那时起，我更懂得了我们为什么要抗美援朝，为什么抗美援朝就是保家卫国……”
    接着，像谈家常似的，他给我讲了一个关于他在朝鲜的故事。虽然他讲这个故事的时候是很平常的，而我却受到了很大的感动。我从刘景洲身上找到了千万个志愿援朝的中国人民的形象。他们都是这样勇敢地作出许多惊人的事迹。
      ×                        ×                      ×
    在三月二十日下午，敌人的飞机来轰炸车站的时候，刘景洲表现了他的最崇高、最优秀的工人阶级的精神。敌机在站里投下了好几十颗定时炸弹。敌机去后，天已经黑了，定时弹在站里不断地爆炸。土块、石子、枕木、弹片，在爆炸的浓烟里飞腾。车站上空是一片烟雾。车站两旁的房屋已经起了火。但是，我们的全体铁路工人们和朝鲜工友们都毫不恐惧地从隐蔽的地方走进了烟火中的车站。因为，大家都知道，我们的军事运输不能有一夜的停顿，甚至不能中止一小时。那天夜里有一趟伤员列车要接进来，有两趟重要列车要开出去。大家都了解必须越快越好地把我们的伤员同志们送到后方去休养，让我们的勇士们早一天养好，重上前线去杀那些美国强盗！必须越快越好地把我们的弹药和粮食送到前方去，让我们的大炮有足够炮弹，让我们的勇士们吃得饱饱的，早一天把美国侵略者在朝鲜消灭。——我们的中朝铁路工人们深刻了解自己的责任多么重大。难道定时炸弹的恐怖能消灭我们的工人们对战争和祖国的责任感吗？世界上永不会有这样的炸弹！就在定时弹的封锁下，我们的工务工人们抢修线路；我们的电务工人们抢修电话线；我们的站务工人们抢运列车。………这时刘景洲发现站里九道线上有两颗重约二三十公斤的定时炸弹。如果等它爆炸了，这条线就不能使用。由它在线路上，也不能行车。刘景洲心里像火烧一样。他立刻向车站中共党的支部书记表示，要把这两颗定时炸弹抱走。他要求担负这个任务的坚决的态度，使支部书记无法阻止他。这时已经有六七个工人从石碴里把定时炸弹用手抠出来了。刘景洲看见，立刻把定时炸弹扛在肩上，在黑夜里向着站外跑去。十几分钟以后，站里的人们听见了一声沉闷的爆炸声。大家都耽心：刘景洲完了。但是，我们的刘景洲却平安地跑回来了！他和其余的几个人，又去抠另一个定时炸弹。抠出来以后，大家抢着要扛走。刘景洲推开大家，说：
    “我和这几个家伙已经交‘朋’友了，它炸不了我，还是我来！”说着他又把第二个定时炸弹扛走，扔到站外去了。
    在听完故事以后，我曾经问过刘景洲，为什么他能那样作，他从衣袋里掏出一个小本子来，指给我看他写的几句话：
    “毛主席啊，我一想起你，我就什么都不怕。为了你，我愿意做一切事情！”——这是他刚过鸭绿江的时候写下来的。
    坐在山坡上，刘景洲的年轻的愉快的脸，被朝鲜早春的阳光照得红红的。他告诉我：
    “我是一个共产党员。”——在说这句话的时候，他表现出非常的庄严和骄傲。
    但是，我完全没有想到，这竟然是我听到刘景洲所讲的最后一句话。
      ×                    ×                  ×
    半个多月以后的一天中午，我从前方回来，又到了那个车站上。我没有见着刘景洲。
    晚上，我和车站军事代表住在一起。他告诉我刘景洲已经在抗美援朝的伟大事业中壮烈地牺牲了。
    离车站不远，有一条大江。江桥有一百多公尺长，过桥就是一个山洞。江桥的坡度很大，从江桥到山洞的坡度也很大。半个多月以前，敌机把这座江桥炸坏了一孔，但立刻就被修复了。修复的第二天清早，天还没大亮。一辆机车推送一列弹药车过桥进山洞隐蔽。因为线路不好，列车中部有五辆脱线。黎明，是敌机骚扰最厉害的时候。于是机车只得牵引后面的一部分车辆往回走。其余十多辆车，就停在江桥上了。但是，不能把弹药车就这样摆在桥上，等着敌机轰炸。于是，站上的中朝职工都出动了。大家要把这些弹药车辆推进山洞去。他们把车钩解开，一辆一辆地往上推。推了几辆，大家已经筋疲力尽了，但是谁也没有松劲，心里只有一个念头：“推！”当大家正推着第八辆车，走到进山洞坡度最大的地方时，几架敌机突然飞来，疯狂的扫射开始了。
    在这个严重情况下，军事代表命令工人们立刻散开，找地方隐蔽起来，企图用自己的力量去抵住车辆。但是刘景洲没有走开。他和军事代表两个人不顾敌机的扫射，用全力去抵住车辆。然而两个人的力量阻止不住车辆往下溜。如果让它顺着坡道溜下去，那么，这辆弹药车就会在坡道上像箭似的射下去，直撞还停在桥的另一端的六辆弹药车。那些弹药车立刻就会因猛烈的冲击而爆炸起火，桥梁也必定因而毁坏。这时，他们只想怎样避免这件事情发生，而没有想到头上飞机的疯狂扫射，甚至也没有想到他们两个人的力量阻止不住那么重的车辆。但是他们两个人的力量太小了，抵不住车辆往下溜，这时伏在山坡上隐蔽的工人却急得叫起来，但是他们还没来得及跑回来，刘景洲已经把车辆挡住了。他献出了自己的生命，使其他工友没有遭到敌机扫射的伤害，保全了军事代表，保全了七辆弹药车，保全了桥梁。
    在场的人谁也忘不了那一幕壮烈的情景：当刘景洲发现车辆往下溜的时候，他急忙用一根橇棍插在车辆下边，想使车辆停下来，但是车辆太重，橇棍抵不住，这时，只看见刘景洲把军事代表推出路轨，大声喊着：
    “你重要……”
    话还没有说完，刘景洲已经把自己的身体压到橇棍上……就这样，刘景洲用自己的身体阻挡了弹药车！
    如果有谁要问：刘景洲为什么能这样做？我想，可以用他对我说过的最后一句话来回答：
    “我是一个共产党员。”
    如果有谁要问：刘景洲在这样做的时候，他想到什么？我想，可以用他写在他的本子上的话回答：
    “毛主席，为了你，我愿做一切事情！”
    在死面前，刘景洲想到祖国，想到毛主席，想到受美帝国主义蹂躏的朝鲜人民。刘景洲，是我们祖国的光荣，是中国工人阶级的光荣，是中国人民的光荣。
    在朝鲜战斗着的我们的志愿援朝的铁路工人们当中，像刘景洲这样闪着光辉的自我牺牲精神的高尚、英勇的人，是很多的！——这正是，为什么胜利必然属于我们的重要的原因之一。                （新华社）
