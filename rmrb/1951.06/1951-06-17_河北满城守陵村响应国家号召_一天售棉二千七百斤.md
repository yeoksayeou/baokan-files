　　Shoulingshan Village in Mancheng, Hebei Province, Responds to National Call
　　Selling 2,700 Jin of Cotton in One Day
　　The Chinese Communist Party branch and members in Shoulingshan Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, actively responded to the government and Party's call for selling and storing cotton, leading cotton farmers in a patriotic cotton-selling movement.

　　Shoulingshan Village has 320 households and 4,900 mu of land. Last year, they planted cotton on 2,400 mu and harvested 150,000 jin of cotton. It is estimated that the village currently still has at least 15% of its cotton in storage. After the cotton purchasing work group arrived in the village, cotton-storing households had the following attitudes: they didn't need the money right now and wanted to wait for a higher price; they were willing to sell but no one took the lead, so they were waiting to see what happened; they were wealthy and didn't want to sell at all. Some Party members also held these views.

　　To break the deadlock, the work group first led the branch members to study the State Council's instructions on cotton purchasing and storage work. After explanations in large meetings and discussions in small groups, the Party members realized that this was one of the major tasks at present, and that Party member cadres had the responsibility to ensure its completion. Branch committee member Mi Yinsheng took the lead and sold 170 jin of cotton to the state. Then, Party member Sun Locai also declared that he would sell 120 jin of cotton to the state. Party members without cotton pledged to the Party to mobilize cotton-storing households to sell or store cotton for the state.

　　Then, through the production committee, mass meetings, forums for cotton-storing households, and forums for cotton-planting models were held. The slogan "Selling cotton to the state is a sign of patriotism" was loudly proclaimed. Patriotic education was conducted among the masses. Twenty-one propagandists went to the cotton-storing households to carry out propaganda and mobilization, initially convincing them of the rationale. Farmer Zhang Luomeng initially did not want to sell, but after listening to the propaganda from Mi Wenming and Mi Tingdong, he sold all 200 jin of cotton. Farmer Mi Cangfeng, upon hearing the news that Party member Mi Luocai and labor model Mi Qinghai had sold patriotic cotton, sold all 200 jin of cotton that he had stored for two years. He said: "If it weren't for the People's Government helping us, we wouldn't have harvested so much cotton! Our village bought livestock and built new houses because we made a fortune growing cotton. We should sell cotton to show our patriotism."

　　Most cotton farmers responded to the government's call and sold or stored cotton. However, there were still a few cotton-storing households who pretended not to have any cotton. The CCP village branch, on the one hand, assigned Party member cadres to persuade their friends, and on the other hand, mobilized prestigious cotton farmers to help with the work. Farmer Sun Luoxian was not active in selling cotton, so his neighbor Mi Tingdong went to mobilize him, and as a result, Sun Luoxian sold 250 jin. Sun Wenlin wanted to wait for a higher price, Sun Ruihua went to mobilize him, and as a result, he also sold 60 jin. In one day, 47 households in Shoulingshan Village collectively sold the first batch of 2,700 jin of cotton (seed cotton). Wang Qingyun, secretary of the CCP Mancheng County Committee, praised them for their high patriotic enthusiasm and called on other villages to learn from the cotton farmers of Shoulingshan Village.

　　Currently, there are still some cotton-storing households in Shoulingshan Village who are hiding cotton and not selling it; some are selling a little and storing a little. In-depth propaganda and education should continue to be carried out to mobilize them to learn from the first batch of patriotic cotton-selling farmers and voluntarily sell all their stored cotton to the state.

　　河北满城守陵村响应国家号召        
    一天售棉二千七百斤
    河北省满城县守陵村中共支部、党员，积极响应政府和党关于售棉储棉的号召，带领棉农开展卖棉爱国运动。
    守陵村共三百二十户，四千九百亩地，去年种棉二千四百亩，收了十五万斤棉花。据估计，该村现在至少还存有百分之十五的棉花。购棉工作组到村后，存棉户有这样几种心理：暂时不用钱，想等大价；有意卖，没人伸头，看看动静再说；日子富裕，根本不想卖。有一些党员也有这种想法。
    工作组为打开局面，先领导支部党员学习政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示。经过大会讲解，小组讨论，党员认识到这是当前的重大任务之一，党员干部有责任保证完成。支部委员米银生带头先把一百七十斤棉花卖给国家。接着，党员孙洛才也声明把一百二十斤棉花卖给国家。没有棉花的党员，向党保证动员存棉户把棉花卖给或存给国家。
    接着通过生产委员会，召开了群众大会、存棉户座谈会、种棉模范座谈会。响亮提出“把棉花卖给国家就是爱国表示”的口号。向群众进行爱国主义教育。二十一个宣传员分头对存棉户进行宣传动员，初步说通了道理。农民张洛孟起初不想卖，后来听了宣传员米文明、米庭栋的宣传，就把二百斤棉花都卖了。农民米苍峰听到党员米洛才、劳动模范米清海卖了爱国棉的消息，把存了二年的二百斤棉花全卖了。他说：“要不是人民政府帮助咱们，那会收这么多棉花！咱村买牲口盖新房，就是因为种棉发了家。我们应当卖棉爱国。”
    一般棉农响应政府号召，纷纷售储存棉。但是，还有少数存棉户假装没有棉花。中共村支部一面分配党员干部说服自己的朋友，一面动员有威望的棉农帮助工作。农民孙洛贤卖棉不积极，他的邻居米庭栋就去动员他，结果孙洛贤卖了二百五十斤。孙文林想等着卖大价，孙瑞华去动员他，结果他也卖了六十斤。一天之内，守陵村有四十七户，集体卖了第一批棉花二千七百斤（籽棉）。中共满城县委书记王庆云见他们爱国热情这样高，表扬了他们，并号召其他村向守陵村棉农学习。
    现在，守陵村还有个别存棉户藏着棉花不卖；也有人卖一点存一点。应该继续进行深入的宣传教育，动员他们向第一批爱国售棉的农民学习，自愿地把存棉全部卖给国家。      （殷勤）
