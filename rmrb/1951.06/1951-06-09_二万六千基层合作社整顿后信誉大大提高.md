　　After rectification, the national cooperative rectification work has achieved great success. The purpose of this cooperative rectification work is to enable cooperatives to concentrate all their efforts on serving their members. According to statistics at the end of the first quarter of this year: since the National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference decided to rectify cooperatives in July last year, 26,500 grassroots cooperatives across the country have completed rectification. Currently, there are still 11,500 grassroots cooperatives undergoing rectification. The cooperatives that have been rectified have stopped free market activities unrelated to their members, and have begun to plan procurement and sales operations by investigating the needs of their members to meet their needs; and have initially established democratic systems and accounting, statistics, planning, reporting and other systems. The credit of the cooperatives has therefore been greatly improved. The members all said: "This time, the cooperative is truly our own." Laboring people who have not yet joined the cooperative are clamoring to join the cooperative. The proportion of cooperative members and funds has increased greatly. According to statistics: in the second half of last year, the number of grassroots cooperatives nationwide increased by only 7.5 percent compared with the first half of the year, but the number of members increased by 26.5 percent, and the capital stock doubled.
    The smooth progress of this cooperative rectification work is due to the following methods: First, rectify the business first, and earnestly meet the needs of the members, so the members care about the cooperative and actively participate in the various organizational work of the cooperative. Second, the superior cooperatives simultaneously implement the policy of serving the grassroots cooperatives and support the grassroots cooperatives in meeting the needs of the members. Third, after serving the members in business, accounting, planning, simple quota management and democratic management systems are established to consolidate the results of cooperative rectification. Fourth, some local people's governments have promulgated provisional registration measures for cooperatives, stipulating that cooperatives must meet the conditions stipulated in the registration measures in order to obtain the qualifications of a cooperative and enjoy the preferential treatment of the people's government, which has promoted the cooperative rectification work. Fifth, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, with the support of the national trade departments, implemented a quota allocation system, and a competition campaign was launched among cooperatives.
    There are also some shortcomings in the cooperative rectification work in various places: some cooperatives only rectify the organization but not the business, and some areas only rectify the grassroots cooperatives, and the superior cooperatives do not implement the policy of serving the grassroots cooperatives. These shortcomings once made the cooperative rectification work unable to proceed smoothly. Some cooperatives stipulated during the rectification that each member can only invest one share, and the excess will be refunded, so the cooperative's funds were reduced, affecting the procurement and sales strength. Some cooperatives mechanically understood the principle of not trading with non-members, so that the local products of rural members could not be sold as much as possible, and the goods needed by the members could not be fully supplied. The above shortcomings have been corrected in time after they were discovered.
    At present, in the cooperatives that have been rectified, there has been a phenomenon of declining turnover or losses. After research, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives believes that there are two reasons for the above phenomenon: First, the general cooperative cadres do not know economic accounting. Second, the grassroots cooperatives have few members, few funds, low turnover, and large expenses. Now the superior cooperatives in various places have begun to merge these excessively small cooperatives in order to concentrate manpower and funds, expand business operations, and fully meet the needs of the members.

### 二万六千基层合作社整顿后信誉大大提高

　　二万六千基层合作社整顿后信誉大大提高
    全国合作社整顿工作已有了巨大的成就。这次整社工作的目的在于使合作社能集中全力为社员服务。据今年第一季度末的统计：自去年七月间全国合作社工作者代表会议决定整社以来，全国已有二万六千五百个基层合作社整顿完毕。目前还有一万一千五百个基层合作社正在进行整顿。已经整顿过的合作社已停止了与社员无关的自由市场活动，开始用调查社员需要的方法来计划供销业务，满足社员的需要；并且已初步建立了民主制度和会计、统计、计划、表报等制度。合作社的信誉因此大大提高。社员们都说：“这回合作社才真正是咱们自己的了”。尚未入社的劳动人民纷纷要求参加合作社。合作社社员、资金增加的比例很大。据统计：去年下半年内，全国基层合作社只比上半年增加百分之七点五，但社员增加了百分之二十六点五，股金增加了一倍。
    这次合作社的整顿工作能够如此顺利展开，是由于采取了以下的方法：一、先整顿业务，切实满足社员需要，所以社员关心合作社，积极参加合作社的各种组织工作。二、上级社同时贯彻为基层社服务的方针，支持基层社满足社员需要。三、在业务上已做到为社员服务后，便接着建立会计、计划、简单的定额管理与民主管理制度，巩固了整社的成果。四、有的地区人民政府颁布了合作社暂行登记办法，规定合作社必须符合登记办法规定的条件才能取得合作社的资格，享受人民政府的优待，这样就推动了整社工作。五、全国合作社联合总社在国家贸易部门的支持下实行定量配售制，合作社间展开了评比运动。
    各地合作社在整顿工作中也有一些缺点：有的合作社只整组织不整业务，有的地区只整基层社，上级社没有贯彻为基层社服务的方针。这些缺点曾一度使整社工作不能顺利开展。有的合作社在整顿中规定每个社员只能入一股，多者退还，合作社的资金因此减少，影响了供销力量。有的合作社机械地了解不作非社员交易的原则，使农村社员的土产不能尽量销出，社员所需要的物品也不能充分供应。上述缺点在发现后都已及时纠正。
    目前在已整顿了的合作社中，又发现了营业额下降或亏累的现象。全国合作总社经过研究后，认为产生上述现象的原因有二：一、一般合作社干部不会经济核算。二、基层合作社社员少、资金少、营业额少、开支大。现在各地上级合作社已开始将这些过小的合作社合并起来，以便集中人力、资金，扩大业务经营，充分地满足社员需要。
