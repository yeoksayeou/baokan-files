Who are those "taking Wu Xun as a pretext"?
　　Wei Jia

　　After reading Li Shizhao's introspection published on May 31st, I believe that he is not introspecting, but rather boasting and flaunting himself, dragging in irrelevant matters in an attempt to continue to deceive readers. I am from Guantao County. During the Anti-Japanese War, I worked in the Luxi area, and I am willing to reveal the facts I know to expose the smokescreen that deceives readers.

　　Li Shizhao initially attributed the error of praising Wu Xun to objective factors, listing so many names and article titles, as if to display the lineup of those who erred in order to alleviate his own burden. In fact, each person's article, like history, should "bear the responsibility themselves." In particular, Li Shizhao blames his deep respect for Wu Xun on the fact that "Tangyi County was once renamed Wu Xun County during the Anti-Japanese War" to cover up his mistakes, which is so absurd. I worked in Luxi, and I know that the anti-Japanese people there had no connection with the "Wu Xun spirit" and did not praise Wu Xun. When the underground organization of the Communist Party first appeared there, it was under the leadership of the Lin'nan County Committee. When the anti-Japanese government first appeared, it was called the "Lin-Guan-Tang Office." Later, in order to commemorate a deputy commander of a column who died in battle, it was renamed Yongzhi County. In October 1943, the Jinan Administrative Office of Hebei Province renamed two districts of Tangyi County (not including the entire Tangyi County) and one district of Guan County as Wu Xun County, which was also "using the old name." Because the Kuomintang reactionary rulers inherited the will of the Manchu Qing feudal rulers and tried their best to respect Wu Xun, they had long ago changed the county name and rebuilt the Wu Xun Family Shrine. After the establishment of Pingyuan Province in 1949, Wu Xun County was changed back to Tangyi County. Since Mr. Li collected Wu Xun materials, "fearing that it would not be in-depth and widespread," why didn't he explain this historical fact clearly?

　　Li Shizhao also divided the discussion of Wu Xun's biography into "three things," namely the Wu Xun biography film, Wu Xun himself, and those "taking Wu Xun as a pretext." The film is bad, because some parts are inconsistent with the facts; and Wu Xun himself, even if he is not good, is a person who "has no political activities at all"; and the words and deeds of those who "take Wu Xun as a pretext" "are realistic and the living issue of the people fighting for democracy."

　　The errors of the film have been pointed out by everyone and are obviously undeniable; but how can Wu Xun be said to have no political activities? His behavior was greatly appreciated by the high officials of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, who reported him to the Empress Dowager in order to appease the "Nian Rebellion"; with his "extraordinary achievements," he not only befriended landlords such as Yang Shufang and Lou Junling but also managed to associate with the government; after he founded schools, he also created a group of slaves who were willing to die for the feudal rulers; for himself, he obtained the title of Righteous School Principal and had memorial archways erected; for the people, he painstakingly advised them to be content with being cattle and horses; and he lightly dismissed the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution as merely being due to "illiteracy." Are these not all Wu Xun's activities with political purposes? Mr. Li especially defends those who "take" Wu Xun as a pretext, claiming that what they did was "not government-run" and "the living fight for democracy," which at best was "demanding democracy from the reactionary regime." However, the people's democracy in the world has always come through revolutionary struggle, bought with the blood and heads of countless revolutionaries. How much democracy can those reformists, with their "vigorous and politically strong struggles," obtain from the reactionary rulers? Even if Chiang Kai-shek gave those who "took" Wu Xun as a pretext some "American-style democracy," what did this have to do with the vast majority of the laboring masses in China? Taking Mr. Li as an example, the resistance against Japan in Liaocheng was "vivid and real," but after the fall of Liaocheng, the vast Luxi area was still persevered in by the anti-Japanese people; while Mr. Li insisted on leaving Luxi and going to the "rear" to carry out the so-called "strong struggle." May I ask how much more intense was the struggle in Chongqing at that time than behind enemy lines? How "intense" was the "struggle" that Mr. Li was engaged in at that time? The facts are there and can be verified. How can you arbitrarily make wild claims and deceive readers? What's more, China has won after twelve years of hard struggle, so what is there to advocate for that kind of tail-wagging "active struggle"?

　　Secondly, the so-called "returning stolen goods and redeeming sins" business, those who really did so were probably better than the warlords who did not return stolen goods at that time, but today, when the people are carrying out land reform in full swing, and some landlords are trying every means to hide their wealth, this "returning stolen goods and redeeming sins" method can be used by them, so what is the need to advocate it?

　　Thirdly, there is the desperate attempt to "pull Wu Xun back from the feudal landlord class and the scholar-bureaucrat class to the people." But what is the purpose of pulling him back? Is it to "borrow" him to preach for the landlords to the people? The film and the painted biography depict landlords such as Yang Shufang and Lou Junling as "eager for public good" and "enlightened and progressive," which clearly tells the people who have implemented land reform that "bad landlords are only individual ones like Li Laobian and Zhang Juren." However, those who have been to Tangyi know that that area is full of big landlords, and most of the villages there have high walls, and there are a few tall buildings inside the walls. According to Wu Xun's saying, they are all good people. Didn't Wu Xun say, "Only good people build tall buildings"? However, the landlords in that area have always possessed reactionary armed forces. Yang Shufang was the head of the counter-revolutionary landlord armed forces; the landlords after Yang Shufang also took the organization of counter-revolutionary armed forces as their ability. During the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, they always colluded with the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and were enemies of the people's anti-Japanese forces. They oppressed and killed countless people, and the people there were not liberated until the Japanese invaders surrendered. These "good people," "gentry," and "elders" are all covered in blood! How can praising their cause be worthy of the people who are fighting against the landlords there and the people who have already won? Can this cause be described as "one civil and one military" with the people's revolutionary armed struggle?

　　Wu Xun's painted biography and the film Biography of Wu Xun both say that Wu Xun "gained popular support," as if he was worshipped by many people. Li Shizhao did indeed worship him for more than 20 years because he was from the same hometown as Wu Xun. But as far as I know, during the Great Revolution, although Shandong was under the rule of warlords, there was no Wu Xun in the elementary school textbooks. I graduated from the county elementary school in three years and did not know Wu Xun. My home is more than forty miles away from Liulin, and I have never heard people talk about it. When I studied at Liaocheng Normal School, no one talked about Wu Xun. At that time, the Beijing Morning Post Supplement Bound Volume was sold a lot in the school, and publications such as "Yu Si" and "Creation" were almost one copy per student among progressive students. At that time, the call to "overthrow the Confucian shop" was very common, indicating that the anti-feudal atmosphere in the school was quite strong. Only after the Kuomintang carried out large-scale activities, especially after the "September 18th" Incident, did the "Wu Xun spirit" be clamored by the non-resistanceists. But those who promoted Wu Xun did not necessarily respect Wu Xun. Many students who graduated from Mata Tou Ai Zhai Wu Xun Elementary School also said that "Wu Dou Mo" was ridiculous. Of course, their ridicule was only like ridiculing a "chaste woman." My understanding at the time was that this was "local tyrants and evil gentry playing with the poor," and "Wu Xun was forced by poverty and had no choice." Later, I gradually realized that he was a rogue who pretended to be foolish, but I still did not fully understand the soft bones of this rogue at the time. Therefore, I did not think it was strange that the general "helping writers" boasted about Wu Xun to make a living. Later, I learned that Zhang Guanglu, a so-called Wu Xun believer and school director of Ai Zhai Wu Xun Elementary School, posted a white paper on the gate of the village every year when hiring workers to renew their contracts, saying "This year's wages are not allowed to exceed so and so," and I felt that those who respected Wu Xun were all good at deducting money, "Wu Xun was just a trick they played!" In short, I have never known anyone among the working people or helping writers who regarded Wu Xun as a "sage" who was "better than Confucius," like Li Shizhao. Therefore, I believe that the only people who truly worship Wu Xun are those who are deceived by the works of those who borrow Wu Xun. Therefore, I suggest that future discussions of Wu Xun's biography should provide more historical facts and materials in order to understand its essence; those who have borrowed Wu Xun to deceive readers should also frankly state their motives and historical facts for borrowing in order to expose the essence of their own thoughts, and do not cite any evidence to continue deceiving people, making mistakes again and again.

### “以武训为借托”的是些什么人？

　　“以武训为借托”的是些什么人？
　　韦嘉
    读了五月三十一日报载李士钊的反省，我认为他并不是作反省，而是在自我夸耀、标榜，东拉西扯，以继续蒙蔽读者。我是馆陶县的人，抗日战争时期我一直在鲁西地区做群众工作，我愿意把我所知道的事实，来揭破那些蒙蔽读者的烟幕。
    李士钊一开始就把歌颂武训的错误推向客观，罗列了那么多人名和文章的题目，像是摆一摆错误者的阵容，以减轻自己的负担似的。其实各人的文章与历史一样，都是要“责由自负”的。尤其是李士钊把自己尊崇武训之深，归罪于“抗日时期堂邑县曾一度改为武训县”，以掩盖自己的错误，这又是多么无聊呢？我在鲁西工作，我知道那里的抗日人民，与“武训精神”丝毫没有关系，也并不颂扬武训。那一带，开始有中共地下组织时，是属于临南县委领导的。开始有抗日政权时，是叫做“临馆堂办事处”。后来为了纪念一个纵队副司令员作战牺牲，曾改为永智县。一九四三年十月冀南行署曾将堂邑县的两个区（并不包括堂邑全县）和冠县的一个区划为武训县，那也是“沿用旧名”。因为国民党反动统治者承继了满清封建统治者的遗志，极力尊崇武训，老早就曾改了县名，并重建武训家祠。而在一九四九年平原省成立后，又将武训县仍改为堂邑县。李先生既然搜集武训材料，“唯恐不深入与普及”，为什么不把这一段史实交代清楚呢？
    李士钊又把对武训传的讨论，分成“三回事情”，即武训传影片，武训本人和“以武训为借托”的人。影片不好，是有些与事实不符；而武训其人，就是不好吧，但他是一个“根本没有政治活动的人”；而“以武训为借托”的人，他们的言行，“都是现实的，活生生的人民争民主的问题”。
    影片的错误，大家已经指出，显然无可辩护了；而武训其人怎能说没有政治活动呢？他的行为使满清的大官大为赞许，为他奏明太后，借以安抚“捻乱”；以他的“奇异的功绩”不但交结了杨树芳、娄峻岭等地主并且得以交结官府；他兴学之后，又造出一批为封建统治者效死的奴才；对他个人来说，得了义学正的封号，立坊挂匾；对人民来说，他苦口婆心，为的是要叫被奴役的人民安心作牛马；而且把中国革命基本问题，轻轻地说成仅仅是“不认字”的原故。这许多难道不都是武训有政治目的的活动吗？李先生尤其为“借托”武训的人们声辩，所谓“不是官办的”“活生生的争民主”，充其量也不过是“向反动政权要民主”。但是，世界上，从来的人民民主，都是经过革命斗争，都是无数革命者的热血头颅换来的。那些改良主义者“如火如荼的政治性很强烈的斗争”，究竟能从反动统治者手里要来多少民主呢？就算是当时蒋匪给“借托”武训的人们以一些“美式民主”，这又与中国广大的劳苦群众何干？以李先生为例，聊城抗战是“活生生的”，但聊城失陷后，广大的鲁西地区仍为抗日人民所坚持；而李先生却独独要离开鲁西，跑到“大后方”去进行所谓“强烈的斗争”。试问当时重庆的斗争究竟如何比敌后还强烈？李先生当时所进行的“斗争”又如何“强烈”？事实俱在，可以复按，如何可以任意信口开河，欺骗读者？何况今天中国是经过十二年的苦斗之后胜利了，那种摇尾乞怜的“积极斗争”还有什么可提倡的？
    其次是所谓“退赃赎罪事业”，真正这样做的人在当时大概比不退赃的军阀好一些，但在今天人民正轰轰烈烈进行土地改革，一部分地主正千方百计隐蔽资财，这种“退赃赎罪”的方式，正可被他们所利用，又有什么提倡的必要？
    再其次，就是所谓拚命“把武训从封建地主阶级、士大夫阶级中拉回到人民大众中来”了。但是拉回来干什么呢？是“借托”他向人民为地主说教吗？影片和画传都把杨树芳、娄峻岭等地主说成“急公好义”“开明进步”的，这分明是告诉实行了土地改革之后的人民说：“坏地主只不过是李老辫和张举人等个别的”。然而，到过堂邑的人，都知道那一带是出大财主的，那一带的多数村庄，都有高高的围墙，围墙里有少数的高楼。照武训的说法，那都是好人的。武训不是说过“只见好人盖高楼”吗？但是，那一带的地主，历来都拥有反动的武装，当年的杨树芳就是反革命的地主武装的头子；继杨树芳之后的地主们也都以组织反革命武装为能事。他们在八年抗日战争中，一直是和日寇蒋匪相勾结，而与人民的抗日部队为敌的。他们压迫与杀害了不知多少人民，直到日寇投降，那里的人民才得解放。这些“好人”“士绅”“耆宿”们，都是血债累累的！歌颂他们的事业，如何对得起正在那里向地主进行斗争的人民和已经得到胜利的人民？这种事业能和人民革命的武装斗争，说成“一文一武”吗？
    武训画传和电影武训传，都说武训“颇得民心”，似乎他被很多人所崇拜。李士钊又的确因为和武训同乡而崇拜了他二十多年。但就我所知道的，在大革命时代，虽说山东在军阀统治下，但小学课本上并没有武训。我在县立小学三年毕业，并不知道武训其人。我家离柳林四十多里路，也没有听见人们谈论过。到聊城师范念书时，也没有人讲武训。那时北京晨报副刊合订本在校销售很多，《语丝》、《创造》等刊物在进步同学中差不多人手一册。当时“打倒孔家店”的呼声很普遍，说明学校中反封建的空气，是相当浓的。只有在国民党大肆活动之后，尤其在“九一八”之后，“武训的精神”才被不抵抗主义者大吵大嚷起来。但宣扬武训的人，也未必尊重武训。在马塔头艾寨武训小学毕业的不少同学，也有说“武豆沫”可笑的。当然他们的嘲笑，仅止于像嘲笑一个“节妇”一样。我当时的认识，也觉着这是“土豪劣绅玩弄穷人”，“武训为穷所迫，也是不得已”。后来渐渐认识他是一个装憨卖呆的无赖，但对这个无赖的软骨头当时还是认识不足的。因此对一般“帮闲文人”吹嘘武训借以吃饭，也就不以为怪。后来知道所谓武训信徒艾寨武训小学校董张光闾，每年在雇工续工说价的时候，他都在寨门上贴一张白条说“今年工价不准超过多少多少”，我又觉着尊重武训的人，都是惯会克扣人的，“武训也不过是他们玩的花样而已！”总之我所知道的劳动人民或帮闲文人中，并没有像李士钊这样的把武训当成“比孔子且过之”的“圣人”的。因此我认为真正崇拜武训的人，只有那些被借托武训者的著作所迷惑欺骗的人。所以我建议，今后对武训传的讨论，应多供给史实与资料，以便认识其本质；曾经借托武训欺骗了读者的人，也应坦白自己借托的动机与史实，以暴露自己的思想本质，不要引什么旁证，继续欺人，一错再错。
