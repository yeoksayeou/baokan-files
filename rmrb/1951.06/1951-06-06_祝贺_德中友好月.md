　　Congratulations on "Sino-German Friendship Month"
　　Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee

　　The opening of "Sino-German Friendship Month" in Berlin, the capital of the German Democratic Republic, in early June 1951 is a historically significant event. This marks a further development and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, which will promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries and make a greater contribution to the cause of defending world peace. We have already sent a Chinese People's Representative Delegation headed by Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, to Berlin to participate in the opening ceremony. On the eve of this opening, we are holding this evening party to express our celebration. Let us first pay tribute to the homeland of Marx and Engels, to the German people who have produced many famous scientists, writers, artists, and philosophers, and to President Wilhelm Pieck, the leader of the German people.

　　The friendship between the Chinese and German peoples is very new, but it is very sincere. The year 1949 should be a year worth commemorating by both of our peoples. On October 1st of that year, the People's Republic of China was born in Asia. On October 7th of that year, the German Democratic Republic was born in Europe. These two people's democratic countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union were born so close together in date, just like twins. This is not only worth celebrating by the Chinese and German peoples, but also by the entire peace and democracy camp.

　　The birth of the German Democratic Republic, as Marshal Stalin said, is "a turning point in European history." The near simultaneous birth of the German Democratic Republic and our People's Republic of China can be said to be a turning point in world history. With People's China and Democratic Germany existing side by side with the great peace fortress of the Soviet Union, the balance of power between the aggression camp and the peace camp has undergone a fundamental change, making the imperialist attempt to enslave all mankind impossible.

　　Just look at the world map superficially, with the Soviet Union as the central pivot, the fraternal new democratic countries of Europe and Asia are closely embracing each other, completely united. This great unity of more than 800 million people is an indestructible force for peace. We should especially thank the great Soviet people and thank Lenin and Stalin, the great teachers of the world's working people, for their leadership in the growth of our peace and democracy camp to what it is today, and for the friendship between our Chinese and German peoples.

　　The liberation of our Chinese and German peoples was achieved with the assistance of the Soviet people. Today, we are also modeling ourselves on the Soviet Union in the great cause of building our motherland, and we are going to move through the stage of people's democracy to socialist construction. The Soviet Union has countless valuable experiences for us to draw upon, which can enable us to avoid detours and quickly complete our task of nation-building.

　　Of course, the world imperialists are not willing to give up, and they are doing everything they can to hinder our construction.

　　In Europe, the American, British, and French imperialist blocs, against the will of the German people, occupy western Germany, forcibly divide Germany into two halves, and hinder the peaceful reunification of Germany. Moreover, they are currently plotting even more aggressively to rearm West Germany and reignite another world war.

　　In Asia, China used to bear the brunt, preventing the Chinese people from achieving unification for a long time. But under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, we defeated the imperialist forces of aggression, and except for Taiwan, we have today unified the entire mainland of our motherland. Today, the spearhead of imperialist aggression is concentrated on Korea, where the Korean people are suffering unprecedented disasters. At the same time, the American imperialists are also hindering the democratization of Japan and attempting to rearm Japan as the eastern wing to reignite another world war.

　　World peace is indeed under serious threat at the moment, and our Chinese and German peoples can be said to be on the front lines of the eastern and western wings of defending world peace. In such a world situation, strengthening the friendship and unity between the Chinese and German peoples is indeed of paramount importance.

　　As long as our peace and democracy camp can strengthen unity, continuously expand the foundation of the peace movement, win over the peace-loving people of the world to take on the cause of defending world peace, constantly expose the aggressive conspiracies of the world imperialists, and continuously strike at the aggressive actions of the world imperialists, world peace can be guaranteed. It has been made very clear in the Korean War that due to the strong unity of the Chinese and Korean peoples, and even more due to the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the imperialist plan of aggression has been partially crushed.

　　Since our Chinese and German peoples shoulder equally important tasks in the cause of defending world peace, the strengthening of our unity must not be relaxed for a moment. Let us take "Sino-German Friendship Month" as a starting point and constantly strengthen our ties. We can constantly consider various concrete steps to assist each other in various construction undertakings, exchange experiences, and learn from each other, so as to accomplish our individual mission of building our motherland and our common mission of defending world peace.

　　Long live the indestructible brotherly friendship between the Chinese and German peoples!
　　Long live the unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
　　Long live President Pieck, the great leader of the German people!
　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of the world's people!

### 祝贺“德中友好月”

　　祝贺“德中友好月”
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席  郭沫若
    一九五一年六月初，“德中友好月”将在德意志民主共和国的首都柏林开幕，这是一件具有历史意义的事。这标志着中德两大民族的友谊有了更进一步的发展和巩固，将促进两国的经济与文化的交流，对于保卫世界和平的事业上将有更大的贡献。我们已经派遣了以最高人民法院沈钧儒院长为首的中国人民代表团到柏林去参加开幕典礼，在这开幕的前夜我们特别举行这个晚会来表示庆祝。请让我们首先向马克思，恩格斯的祖国表示敬意，向产生了不少著名的科学家，文学家，艺术家，哲学家的德意志人民表示敬意，向德意志人民领袖威廉·皮克大总统表示敬意。
    中德两国人民的友谊是很新鲜的，然而是很诚挚的。一九四九年应该是值得我们两国人民共同纪念的一年。在这一年的十月一日，在亚洲我们中华人民共和国诞生了。在这一年的十月七日，在欧洲德意志民主共和国诞生了。这两个在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营里面的人民民主国家，诞生的日期这样的接近，真好像一对双生子一样。这不仅值得我们中德两国人民共同庆幸，也值得我们整个的和平民主阵营共同庆幸。
    德意志民主共和国的诞生，诚如斯大林大元帅所说是“欧洲历史的转折点”，德意志民主共和国和我们中华人民共和国的差不多同时诞生，更可以说是世界历史的转折点。有人民中国和民主德国，与伟大的和平堡垒苏联并肩存在，这使侵略阵营和和平阵营的力量对比，起了基本上的变化，使世界帝国主义奴役全人类的侵略企图要成为不可能了。
    单把世界地图从表面上来看一看吧，以苏联为中心枢轴，欧洲和亚洲的新民主主义的兄弟国家，紧紧拥抱着，完全打成了一片。这八万万以上的人民大团结，这是不可摧毁的一个和平力量。我们和平民主阵营之有今天这样的壮大，我们中德两国人民之有今天这样的友好，我们应该特别感谢伟大的苏联人民，感谢全世界劳动人民的伟大导师列宁和斯大林的领导。
    我们中德两国人民的得到解放，都是得到了苏联人民的协助的。我们今天在建设祖国的伟大事业中又同样在以苏联为模范，要通过人民民主的阶段走向社会主义的建设，苏联有可供我们取之不尽，用之不竭的无数宝贵经验，可以使我们少走些冤路，迅速完成我们建国的任务。
    当然世界帝国主义者是不能够甘心的，它们正在用尽力量来阻挠我们的建设。
    在欧洲，美英法帝国主义集团违背德国人民的意志，霸占着德国西部，强制的把德国分为两半，阻挠着德国的和平统一。而且在目前还有加无已在策动着侵略的阴谋，企图重新武装西德，再卷起一次世界战争。
    在亚洲，以前是我们中国首当其冲，使我们中国人民长期得不到统一。但我们在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导之下，我们把帝国主义侵略势力打败了，除掉台湾之外，我们今天是把大陆上的祖国整个统一了。在今天帝国主义的侵略的矛头又集中到了朝鲜，使朝鲜人民正遭受着史无先例的灾难。同时美帝国主义者也正阻挠着日本的民主化，并企图重新武装日本，作为再卷起一次世界战争的东方的一翼。
    世界和平在目前的确是受着严重的威胁的，我们中德两国人民更可以说是处在保卫世界和平的东西两翼的最前线。在这样的世界的局势之下，加强中德两国人民的友谊团结，的确是具有头等重要的意义。
    只要我们和平民主阵营能够加强团结，不断的扩大和平运动的基础，争取全世界爱好和平的人民来担当保卫世界和平的事业，不断的揭露世界帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，不断的打击世界帝国主义者的侵略行动，世界和平是可以得到保障的。在朝鲜战争中已经表示得很明白，由于中朝人民的坚强团结，更由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的英勇作战，已经把帝国主义的侵略计划局部粉碎了。
    我们中德两国人民在保卫世界和平事业中既担负着同等重要的任务，我们的团结的加强也就一刻也不容许松懈。我们就请以“德中友好月”为起点，经常不断的来加强我们的联系吧。我们可以不断的考虑出各种具体的步骤来，在各方面的建设事业中相互协助，相互交流经验，相互学习，以完成我们的建设祖国的个别的使命和保卫世界和平的共同的使命。
    中德人民不朽的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主主义阵营团结万岁！
    德意志人民伟大的领袖皮克大总统万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界人民伟大的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
