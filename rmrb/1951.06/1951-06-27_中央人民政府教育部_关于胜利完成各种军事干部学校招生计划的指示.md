The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government
    Instructions on Successfully Completing Enrollment Plans for Various Military Cadre Schools

　　Since the joint announcement by the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council in December of last year regarding the decision to recruit young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools, thanks to the enthusiastic response and active registration of young people from various regions, and the active cooperation of school administrations, the original enrollment plans for the first and second phases were overfulfilled in a single effort last winter. In order to fully complete the established enrollment plan, and to more effectively consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and strengthen our national defense, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has issued a decision on the enrollment of students for various military cadre schools. The education departments of governments at all levels and all schools must coordinate with relevant parties, in accordance with the prescribed conditions and quotas, to ensure the successful completion of this task as scheduled. For this purpose, the following instructions are hereby issued:

　　(1) In accordance with the decision of the Government Administration Council, "Military Cadre School Enrollment Committees" should be promptly established at all levels in conjunction with relevant parties, and candidates for membership of the "Student Recommendation Committees for Military Cadre Schools" under their jurisdiction should be designated. Based on the student situation in each province and city, the types, quotas, and dates for student recommendations from the schools under their jurisdiction should be specifically arranged level by level in a planned manner. The allocation of student categories for recommendation from each school should have a focus, avoiding the mobilization of all types within one school, which would create difficulties in allocation upon admission.

　　(2) Over the past year, students' political awareness has generally improved during the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and patriotic education. Schools should carry out more practical and in-depth mobilization of students on this ideological basis. The publicity and mobilization work must be carried out in a spirit of seeking truth from facts, so that all students correctly understand the current political situation and the needs of national construction; recognize that responding to the call of the motherland, participating in national defense, and defending the motherland are the most glorious tasks for young people. We must carry forward the glorious tradition and patriotism of Chinese youth students participating in the revolutionary armed struggle, further enhance students' political awareness, and encourage them to actively register on a voluntary basis. In secondary schools (mainly ordinary middle schools), mobilization can be carried out in accordance with the method of enrollment last winter; in institutions of higher learning, since the number of recommended candidates is relatively small, it is not necessary to launch large-scale registration. On the basis of last winter's registration, the prescribed quota can be completed by soliciting opinions publicly and based on the conditions. The recruitment of senior primary school graduates should be focused on counties and cities, and enrollment can be carried out both inside and outside the school, so as to simultaneously absorb older, out-of-school senior primary school graduates.

　　(3) The students recommended last winter were generally good, but there were also a few whose political conditions did not meet the original standards, which was the result of some schools not being serious and responsible enough during the examination. This time, after students register, the "Recommendation Committees" of each school must, with a high degree of responsibility to the country, carefully examine and verify the students' qualifications in accordance with the prescribed conditions, and then submit the list of recommended students to the higher-level Enrollment Committee for formal approval. Necessary and appropriate explanations should be given to students who have registered but have not been approved.

　　(4) School administrations should promptly complete the procedures for students leaving school according to the list submitted by the "Recommendation Committee." Students who have not reached the graduation year should be issued a certificate of completion of studies; students who are due to graduate this summer and do not have time to take the exam may be exempted from the exam and issued a graduation certificate based on their usual grades (students who have been preliminarily examined and recommended by the school but have not been approved for admission by the Enrollment Committee should be allowed to take a make-up exam upon their return to school); and help students solve the difficulties in their lives before leaving school, organize warm farewells and condolences, and send responsible cadres to accompany students to the provincial and municipal "Enrollment Committees" to be responsible for proper care.

　　(5) Living expenses and travel expenses for students from the school to the county or provincial/municipal "Enrollment Committee" shall be borne and reimbursed by the school. Living expenses and transfer travel expenses from the county to the provincial/municipal Enrollment Committee and to the "Enrollment Committee" or receiving station of the province, municipality, or greater administrative region shall be borne by the "Enrollment Committee," and paid and reimbursed from the provincial/municipal reserve fund. All expenses after being received by the military cadre school shall be borne and reimbursed by the military cadre school.

　　(6) After the recommended students leave school, each school should immediately resume normal work, continue to pay attention to students' political and current affairs education, and appropriately adjust classes and determine summer enrollment plans based on the number of students leaving school. Students should be organized to frequently write letters to the students participating in the military cadre school to express their condolences and encouragement.

　　(7) After the work is completed, the education departments of the governments of the major administrative regions and the five provinces and two cities in North China should conduct inspections and summaries, and submit special reports to the Ministry.

　　中央人民政府教育部
    关于胜利完成各种军事干部学校招生计划的指示
    自去年十二月中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会与政务院联合发布招收青年学生、青年工人参加各种军事干部学校的决定以来，由于各地青年的热烈响应，踊跃报名，和学校行政方面的积极配合，原定一、二两期的招生计划，得以在去年冬季一次超额完成。为了全部完成既定的招生计划，更有效地巩固人民民主专政，加强我国国防建设，中央人民政府政务院已发布了关于各种军事干部学校招收学生的决定。各级人民政府教育部门、各学校必须协同有关方面，按照规定的条件与名额，保证胜利地如期完成此项任务。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）根据政务院的决定迅速会同有关方面成立各级“军事干部学校招生委员会”，并指定所属各校“军事干部学校学生保送委员会”委员人选。根据各省市学生情况有计划地逐级具体布置所属各省、市各学校保送学生的类别、名额及日期。分配各校保送学生的类别要有重点，避免在一个学校内各种都动员。致造成分配入学时的困难。
    （二）一年以来，在抗美援朝爱国主义教育的运动中，学生的政治觉悟已普遍提高。各学校应在这种思想基础上向学生进行更切实深入的动员。宣传动员工作，必须贯彻实事求是的精神，务使全体学生正确认识当前的政治形势与国家各项建设的需要；认识响应祖国号召，参加国防建设，保卫祖国是青年最光荣的任务。发扬中国青年学生参加革命武装斗争的光辉传统和爱国主义精神，进一步提高学生的政治觉悟，在自愿的基础上踊跃报名。在中等学校（主要是普通中学）中，可按照去年冬季招生的办法进行动员；在高等学校中，因保送名额较少，不必大规模地发动报名，可在去年冬季报名的基础上，采取公开征求意见的方法，依据条件完成规定的名额即可。招收高小毕业生，应有重点地布置到县市，可采取校内外同时招生办法，以便同时吸收年龄较大的失学的高小毕业生入学。
    （三）去冬保送的学生，一般是好的，但也有少数政治条件不合原规定标准的，这是由于有些学校审查时不够认真负责的结果。此次各学校“保送委员会”于学生报名后，必须以高度对国家负责的态度，按规定条件认真审查然后提出保送的学生名单，送交上级招生委员会正式批准。对报名而未被批准的学生则应作必要的和适当的解释。
    （四）学校行政方面，按“保送委员会”提出的名单应迅速办理学生离校手续：未届毕业年限者，应发给修业证明书；今年暑假应毕业学生，不及参加考试时，可以平时成绩为本学期成绩免试发给毕业证明书（经学校初步审查保送的学生未经招生委员会批准录取者，回学校后应准予补考）；并帮助同学解决离校前生活上的困难，组织热烈的欢送与慰劳，派负责干部陪送学生到省、市“招生委员会”，负责妥善照料。
    （五）学生由学校到县或省、市“招生委员会”的生活费及旅费由学校负责供给报销。由县到省、市招生委员会以及到省、市或大行政区的“招生委员会”或接收站后的生活费及转送旅费，由“招生委员会”负责供给。在省、市预备费项下开支报销。军事干部学校接收后一切费用由军事干部学校负责供给报销。
    （六）保送的学生离校后，各校应即恢复经常工作，继续注意学生的政治时事教育，并根据离校学生多寡，适当调整班级，确定暑假招生计划。应组织学生对参加军干校的同学经常地写信给以慰问和鼓励。
    （七）工作结束后，各大行政区及华北五省二市人民政府教育部门应进行检查总结。专题报部。
