　　A Novel Distorting Reality
    ——Opinions on Ding Kexin's Novel "Old Worker Guo Fushan"
        Liu Hao
    The first piece in the first issue of Volume IV of "People's Literature" is Ding Kexin's novel: "Old Worker Guo Fushan." Through the portrayal of the old worker Guo Fushan, who was once harmed by the Japanese invaders, the author shows that the liberated workers are actively working and creating a better life with the attitude of masters. When the war of aggression against Korea by American imperialism broke out, the old worker saw with his own eyes that the motherland of his Korean workmate, Old Jin, who had saved him in the past, and his own motherland were being destroyed by American imperialism. He resolutely refused to leave, he wanted to: "When the American bandits come, I can tear them in half." In the face of the crazy bombing and strafing of American imperialist planes, in the most cruel and tense situation, he bravely led the young workers, day and night, to repair the Yalu River Bridge that linked the people of China and Korea together. When bombs fell, he disregarded his own safety and used his body to cover the section chief; in the midst of flying炮火, he rescued the wounded young workers, until he spat blood and fainted on the ground....
    These are all extremely moving facts, and they are precisely the facts that the heroic Chinese workers have shown in this great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and defend our country. It is exciting that the author timely expresses these through literary works. However, it is very regrettable that the author completely violated reality when dealing with Guo Zhanxiang, the son of the old worker Guo Fushan—an important character—and made a great distortion of the workers and the Party, which fatally damaged this work.
    How does the author initially tell us what kind of person Guo Zhanxiang is? He is a Communist Party member, the branch secretary of the engineering section, and joined the Party more than two years earlier than his father. Before the old worker Guo Fushan knew that his son was a Party member, he could already see: "...his son's work is done well, and he has a high prestige among the masses. People have opinions about work, problems between each other, and difficulties in the family, they all go to Zhanxiang to discuss them..." After the Party was made public, Guo Fushan compared Zhanxiang to all the Party members who were "not bad" and "qualified" in turn: "...it turns out that his son Zhanxiang is indeed a little stronger and a little higher than anyone else..." Guo Zhanxiang not only summarized and promoted the new method of sieving ballast created by his father, improving work efficiency; but also when arranging the trial implementation of the model road maintenance team, he used very correct reasoning to persuade everyone's debate. The old worker himself thought: "...his son is stronger than himself," so "he put down the airs of being a father and carefully obeyed his son's leadership, not allowing himself to have the slightest shortcomings in anything."
    When this great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea occurred, most of the old workers over fifty years old, like Guo Fushan, insisted on staying to work. In order to adapt to the combat environment, the workers lived a collective life and put forward the slogan of: "Stick to our posts and do our job well"; Party members also had to hold regular branch meetings and write letters of determination: in order to resist America and aid Korea, to give our lives and everything to the motherland and to the Party.
    At this time, how does this branch secretary Guo Zhanxiang, who is "almost without any bad points," perform? A very surprising answer appears in Ding Kexin's novel——
    "...In these days of heroic struggle, an inglorious thing happened..." "...At a criticism meeting, people sharply criticized individual spineless people who were afraid of planes, afraid of bombing, and afraid of death..." "Who is this person?——It is Guo Zhanxiang, the branch secretary of the engineering section"; the one who became the target of public criticism at the criticism meeting was the one the author repeatedly introduced: "...Everything is good: leading work is well planned; he goes deep into the scene to study it well; he is selfless and has good character; he unites the masses and has good relations; he is almost without any bad points" Guo Zhanxiang. Such an excellent worker, Communist Party member, and branch secretary suddenly plummeted and suddenly became a "spineless person who is afraid of death." This is not only like what the author wrote: "happening to someone who is almost unbelievable," but also happening to someone who is completely unbelievable.
    Let's not even say that in this great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, how the people of the whole country have raised their political consciousness and set off an unprecedented patriotic upsurge, and Guo Zhanxiang's behavior inexplicably contradicts this; just in terms of the development of the character Guo Zhanxiang himself in the novel, such a strange change suddenly appeared is also completely inconceivable.
    We know that: "courage" cannot exist in isolation from class consciousness. It is unimaginable that a person who is usually without any awareness will suddenly become very firm and brave at the most acute moment of struggle; by the same token, as the author tells us, a Party leader who usually has a very high level of class consciousness and performs well in all aspects, at the critical moment of resisting America and aiding Korea, when many non-Party masses are showing extraordinary bravery and tenacity, he alone suddenly becomes a "spineless person who is afraid of death." This is also incomprehensible.
    The author also tells us a reason through Guo Zhanxiang, that is: in 1944, Guo Zhanxiang was caught by the Japanese and sent to North Manchuria as a forced laborer. Two months before the Japanese surrender, because he was about to riot, he was discovered, and the enemy strafed with machine guns. Zhanxiang was at the west end of the line and escaped from a pile of dead bodies. This incident gave him a deep "stimulus," and even now his nerves and heart are not very healthy. Therefore, at the criticism meeting, he glanced at his father fearfully and said in a tearful voice: "...I am really not afraid of planes, nor am I afraid of bombs, but I can't listen to machine gun strafing. As soon as I hear those few 'da da da' sounds, my heart beats uncontrollably, and I can't help but run far away..."
    I believe that this reason is by no means a reason.
    We have seen in newspapers and heard at accusation meetings: thousands of people who have been persecuted by the enemy have not been "stimulated" into becoming "spineless people who are afraid of death," but on the contrary, have aroused their hatred for the enemy and raised their political consciousness, thus generating unparalleled power, and have more bravely and resolutely moved towards the struggle for revenge and liberation. But why is it that the worker Guo Zhanxiang in Ding Kexin's writing has the opposite effect?
    According to the logic arranged in the novel, it can only give people the impression that this is a physiological symptom—not afraid of planes, not afraid of bombs, only afraid of machine guns. I dare not guarantee that there is no one in the world who has escaped death from machine gun strafing who will not have a fear of machine guns, but to add this "rare in the world" physiological reason to a worker who is praised as a hero by the author, causing him to be reduced to a "spineless person who is afraid of death," is obviously the author's subjective fabrication, and cannot achieve the purpose of explaining why Guo Zhanxiang has undergone this change.
    I repeatedly thought: why did the author deal with it this way? Is it to highlight the strength and unyielding spirit of the father Guo Fushan by contrasting it with the son Guo Zhanxiang's wavering fear of death? Is it to tell people: the lesson that people who are usually active may waver when the struggle is most cruel? Is it to pursue the "twists and turns" of the story and deliberately create an "ups and downs"?...
    The author describes the one who became a "spineless person who is afraid of death," a "heap of loose stool," in the movement of resisting America and aiding Korea is a Communist Party member and branch secretary who usually has a high prestige among the masses and performs well in all aspects! What does this mean? Obviously, the author has no understanding of the great leading role played by the Party among the masses in the movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, and the exemplary behavior of the large number of Communist Party members in this movement.
    In this way, Guo Zhanxiang, a branch secretary who was dismissed for his cowardice and fear of death in the struggle, suddenly reappeared when his father led the rescue of the Yalu River Bridge: "...His son Zhanxiang is also in it. This kid is much stronger now, running in front, and even greeted his father." Wasn't this "spineless person who is afraid of death" supposed to "run far away uncontrollably" as soon as he heard the sound of a machine gun? Why is he suddenly "much stronger" and "running in front" now? Isn't there the sound of machine guns at this moment? No! At that time, the enemy was bombing and strafing very intensely! So if he overcame his fear of death, how exactly did he overcome it? There is no expression of this in the work at all. According to the author's description, it can only lead people to the conclusion that Guo Zhanxiang's transformation was influenced by his father, not as a result of the Party's education. Such a description that lowers the educational role of the Communist Party to be less than the influence of the masses is not true, and is a distortion of reality.
    In several other places, the author also indiscriminately expresses some extremely accidental and non-essential events. For example: when the Japanese occupied it, the old worker Guo Fushan, because his salary was not enough to eat, colluded with others to "steal coal" and was caught by the police section. How was this cruelty resolved? "Unexpectedly," because the Korean workmate Old Jin could say a few words of Japanese and knelt down to plead with the Japanese, "the Japanese laughed heartily" and stopped beating him. Another example: when Guo Zhanxiang was a child, he fought with Old Jin's child, and he scolded: "Your Koreans are slaves of a fallen country, coming to our Manchuria to work, you have no shame!"
    These seem to be some detailed issues, but they are related to the problems exposed earlier. Here, the author's erroneous understanding is similarly expressed.
    Isn't it true that the Japanese invaders were as cruel to Korean workers as they were to Chinese workers? Is it possible that because Korean workers could say a few words of Japanese, they could just "laugh heartily" and let it go? Maybe there really is such an "unexpected" event in thousands of cases, but I don't understand why the author wants to choose such an extremely accidental thing to portray Korean workers?
    During the puppet Manchukuo period, it is undeniable that some people were subjected to slavish education and had their national consciousness obliterated, and they also referred to "Manchukuo," but as far as I know, people with some national consciousness were unwilling to call it that. Why specifically put it on the son of the old worker Guo Fushan, who suffered and was bullied but was also strong-willed?
    All these errors precisely show that this work lacks reality, and also shows that the author has an incorrect understanding of the workers and the Party. Many places are fabricated out of thin air based on the author's incorrect subjective imagination. In this way, providing readers with so much erroneous content is not praising the heroism and activeness of the Chinese working class in resisting America and aiding Korea in order to encourage the people to move forward; nor can it be said that it is criticizing some possible shortcomings within the working class in order to seek improvement. It must be said that this is a great distortion of the working class and a great distortion of the role played by the Communist Party among the workers!
    In the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, our Chinese workers, like the Chinese People's Volunteers, have created countless heroic deeds. Expressing these heroic deeds in literary works, praising them, and educating the people is the bounden duty of all literary workers who have the opportunity to understand these lives. But some people are violating reality and making distorted portrayals of the workers and the Party. I think this is intolerable.

### 一篇歪曲了现实的小说——对丁克辛的小说《老工人郭福山》的意见

　　一篇歪曲了现实的小说
    ——对丁克辛的小说《老工人郭福山》的意见
        刘浩
    《人民文学》第四卷第一期的头一篇，登载了丁克辛同志的小说：《老工人郭福山》。作者通过对当年被日寇残害过的老工人郭福山的描写，表现解放了的工人正以主人翁的态度，积极劳动，创造美好的生活。当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争爆发以后，老工人亲眼看到：当年救过他的朝鲜工友老金的祖国和他自己的祖国都在受美帝国主义的破坏。他坚决不走，他要：“美国强盗来，我能撕他们两半。”在美帝国主义的飞机疯狂的轰炸扫射，最残酷最紧张的情况下，他勇敢地带领着青年工友，不分昼夜，抢修把中朝两国人民联在一起的鸭绿江大桥。炸弹落下来时，他不顾生命的危险，用他的身体盖住了段长；在炮火纷飞的时候，他抢救着负了伤的青年工友，一直到吐了血，晕倒在地上……。
    这些都是极感动人的事实，也正是英勇的中国工人，在这抗美援朝，保家卫国的伟大运动中所表现出来的事实，作者及时地通过文艺作品来表现这些，是应该令人兴奋的。但是，非常遗憾的是：作者在处理老工人郭福山的儿子——郭占祥这一重要人物时完全违反了现实，对工人，对党做了极大的歪曲，致命地损害了这篇作品。
    作者最初告诉我们郭占祥是怎样一个人物呢？他是共产党员，工务段的支部书记，比他父亲早入党两年多。老工人郭福山在党公开以前，还不知道他儿子是党员时，便已看得出：“……儿子的工作做得不错，在群众中威信很高。人们对工作有意见，相互之间有问题，家庭里有困难，都是一个劲儿找占祥商量……”在公开党以后，郭福山在所有“他不错”“他够资格”的党员中轮流地比了一下：“……原来儿子占祥，确乎是比谁也强一点，高一点……”郭占祥不仅总结推广了他父亲创造的筛石碴的新方法，提高了工作效率；而且在布置试行模范养路队的工作时，他用很正确的道理说服了大家的争论。老工人自己想：“……儿子比自己强”，因此“他放下了作父亲的架子，小心谨慎地服从着儿子的领导，不让自己在任何事情上有半点缺点”。
    当抗美援朝这一伟大的运动发生以后，大多数五十以上的老工人也和郭福山一样坚持留下工作。为了适应战斗环境，工人们过着集体生活，提出：“坚持岗位，搞好工作”的口号；党员还要经常开支部大会，写下决心书：为了抗美援朝，把自己的生命和一切交给祖国，交给党。
    这种时候，这位“简直没有一点不好”的支部书记郭占祥怎样表现呢？丁克辛同志的小说里出现了非常令人惊异的答案——
    “……在这英勇斗争的时日里，竟发生了一件不光彩的事情……”“……在一个批评大会上，人们尖锐地批评着个别怕飞机，怕轰炸，怕死的软骨头……”“这人是谁呢？——是工务段的支部书记郭占祥”；在批评大会上成为众矢之的的，就是这位作者一再介绍的：“……什么都好：领导工作计划好；深入现场钻研好；大公无私品质好；团结群众关系好；简直没有一点不好”的郭占祥。那样一位优秀的工人，共产党员，支部书记竟一落千丈，突然变成了“怕死的软骨头”了，这不仅像作者所写的：“发生在几乎不可信的人的身上”，而且是发生在完全不能令人相信的人身上。
    我们姑且不说，在抗美援朝这一伟大的运动中，全国人民如何提高了政治觉悟，掀起了空前未有的爱国热潮，而郭占祥的行为却不可解释地与此发生了矛盾；单就作者在小说里所表现的郭占祥这一人物本身的发展来说，突然出现了这样奇异的变化也是完全不可思议的。
    我们知道：“勇敢”是不可能离开阶级觉悟而孤立存在的，一个平素毫无觉悟的人，在斗争最尖锐的时候，忽然十分坚决、勇敢起来，这是不可想像的；同样道理，像作者所告诉我们的，一个平常具有很高的阶级觉悟，各方面都表现得很好的党的领导人，到了抗美援朝的紧要关头，许多非党群众都表现得异常英勇而顽强的时候，独有他一下变成“怕死的软骨头”了，这也是令人不能理解的。
    作者也通过郭占祥告诉我们一点理由，那就是：一九四四年郭占祥被日本抓到北满当劳工，在日本投降前两个月，因为要暴动被发觉，敌人用机枪扫射，占祥在队列西头，从死人堆里逃出来。这件事给他的刺激很深，直到现在他的神经和心脏还不很健康。因此，在批评会上他畏惧地看了他父亲一眼，带着哭音说：“……我真的不怕飞机，也不怕炸弹，可是我不能听机枪的扫射，我要一听‘哒哒哒’这几下，我立刻就心跳得不行，身不由己的要往远处奔……”
    我认为：这一理由是决不成为理由的。
    我们在报纸上看到过，在控诉会上听到过：千万个遭受过敌人迫害过的人们，不是“刺激”得变成“怕死的软骨头”，而恰恰相反，更激起他们对敌人的仇恨，提高了他们的政治觉悟，因而产生无比的力量，为了报仇、为了解放，更勇敢坚决地走向斗争。但是丁克辛同志笔下的工人郭占祥却为什么适得其反呢？
    照小说所安排的逻辑，只能给人这样一种印象：这是生理上的病症——不怕飞机，不怕炸弹，单怕机枪。我不敢担保世界上没有一个从机枪扫射中死里逃生的人，不会产生惧怕的心理，但把这“天下难得”的生理上的原因加在一个被作者颂为英雄的工人身上，使他一降为“怕死的软骨头”，却显然是作者主观的臆造，是达不到他解释郭占祥为什么发生这种变化的目的的。
    我反复地思索：作者为什么要这样处理？是为了以儿子郭占祥的动摇怕死而突出父亲郭福山的坚强不屈吗？是为了告诉人们：平常积极的人到斗争最残酷的时候也会动摇的教训吗？是为了追求故事的“曲折”而故意来个“起伏”吗？……
    作者这样来描写在抗美援朝中变成“怕死的软骨头”，“稀屎一滩”的是平常在群众中具有很高威信，各方面表现得都好的共产党员，支部书记呀！这说明什么呢？显然作者对抗美援朝运动中党在群众中所起的伟大的领导作用，同这一运动中大量出现的共产党员模范行为是没有认识的。
    就这样，一位在斗争中表现得胆怯怕死而被撤了职的支部书记郭占祥，到了他父亲领头抢救鸭绿江大桥时，忽然他又出现了：“……儿子占祥也在里面，这小子现在也坚强多了，跑在前面，还对父亲打了个‘招呼’”。这位“怕死的软骨头”不是听了机枪声就“身不由己的要往远处奔”吗？为什么他这会儿突然又“坚强多了”，“跑在前面”了？难道这会儿没有机枪声了吗？不像！那时敌人轰炸、扫射得很紧张的呀！那么如果是他克服了怕死的思想，究竟怎样克服的？在作品中却没有一点表现。根据作者的描写，只能使人得到这样一个结论，郭占祥的转变是受了他父亲的影响，而不是由于党的教育的结果。这样把共产党的教育作用降低到不如群众的影响的描写是不真实的，是对现实的一种歪曲。
    作者在另外几个地方，也不加选择地表现了一些极偶然，非本质的事件。譬如：日本占着的时候，老工人郭福山因为工资不够吃，与人合伙“偷煤”被警务段捉住，敌人把他装在麻袋里乱摔。这场残害是怎样解决的呢？“出乎意外”的因为朝鲜工友老金会说几句日本话，跪到日本人面前一请求，“日本人哈哈大笑一场”就不再摔他了。再譬如：郭占祥小的时候和老金的孩子打架，他骂道：“你们朝鲜是亡国奴，跑到咱满洲国做工，好不要脸！”
    这看起来似乎是一些细节问题，但是和前面所暴露的问题有联系，这里同样地表现了作者的错误认识。
    难道说日寇不是和残害中国工人一样地残害着朝鲜工人吗？可能因为朝鲜工人会说几句日本话“哈哈大笑一场”就了事吗？也许千万件里真有这么一件“出乎意外”，但我不明白为什么作者要选取这样一件极其偶然的事情来表现朝鲜工人呢？
    在伪满时，不可否认地有些人是受了奴化教育，泯灭了民族意识，也称起“满洲国”来，但据我所知多少有些民族意识的人，都不肯这样叫。为什么单单要按在受苦受欺但又刚强志气的老工人郭福山的儿子身上呢？
    所有这些错误正说明这篇作品是缺少现实性的，而且也说明作者对工人，对党存在着不正确的认识，许多地方是凭着作者这种不正确的主观想像凭空虚构的。这样，把许多错误的内容供给读者，这不是表扬了抗美援朝中中国工人阶级的英勇、积极，以鼓舞人民前进；也谈不上这是批评工人阶级内部某些可能存在的缺点以求得改进。不能不说这是对工人阶级的极大的歪曲，对共产党在工人当中所起的作用的极大歪曲！
    在伟大的抗美援朝运动中间，我们中国工人和中国人民志愿军一样不知创造了多少英雄事迹，把这些英雄事迹用文艺作品表现出来，歌颂他们，教育人民，这是一切有机会了解这些生活的文艺工作者责无旁贷的义务。但有人竟违反现实地对工人、对党加以歪曲的描写，我觉得这是不能容忍的。
