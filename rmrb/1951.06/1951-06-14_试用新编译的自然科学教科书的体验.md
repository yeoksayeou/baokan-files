　　Experiences from Trial Use of Newly Compiled Natural Science Textbooks
    Deputy Minister of Education, Northeast People's Government, Dong ChunCai

　　After the middle schools in the Northeast region transitioned to normalcy, the necessity for reforming the middle school curriculum and teaching materials was felt. As early as 1948, we had already begun translating Soviet middle school natural science textbooks, originally intending them as references for natural science teaching and for compiling new textbooks ourselves. By the autumn of 1949, we found that middle school coursework was heavy, and streamlining the curriculum and revising textbooks became an urgent and pressing requirement.

　　How exactly should natural science textbooks be revised? At the time, we faced two options: one was to revise the existing textbooks, and the other was to adapt the newly translated Soviet middle school textbooks as a blueprint. Comparing the two, we decided to abandon the former option and adopt the latter. The reason was that the viewpoints, materials, and methods of the old textbooks were relatively outdated, while the viewpoints, materials, and methods of the newly compiled Soviet middle school textbooks were more progressive and closer to the level of middle school students in the Northeast. Thus, we gathered a group of compilers and teachers to proofread and slightly adapt them. Since 1950, new textbooks for junior high school arithmetic, algebra, botany, zoology, physics, chemistry, geometry, and other subjects have been trialed.

　　These new textbooks have several recognized advantages over the old textbooks: First, they use the most advanced scientific theoretical knowledge as content (for example, the botany and zoology textbooks are based on the advanced Michurin biology theory), and they provide a dialectical materialist explanation of the laws of nature and its development (for example, the physics textbook pays attention from the beginning to implementing the basic concept of the materialist worldview in explaining physics knowledge: the materiality of the world, the interconnectedness of natural phenomena, and the causal relationships between them, etc.). Second, theory is linked to practice, and the spirit of learning for application is贯串; that is, the scientific principles taught in the textbook are linked to industrial and agricultural production, serving as the basis for students to understand production theory. For example, explaining botany principles is linked to agricultural production and plant modification issues, explaining chemistry principles is linked to certain basic issues of the chemical industry, and explaining physics principles is linked to basic issues such as machinery and electricity in industry. At the same time, great importance is also attached to teaching practice, that is, attention is paid to experiments, observations, and internships, so that students can verify, experience, and understand scientific knowledge from scientific experiments, observations, and internships. Third, it is suitable for teaching principles. This set of textbooks arranges teaching materials and handles problems according to teaching laws such as from shallow to deep, from simple to complex, from known to unknown, and from concrete to abstract. Therefore, it is very suitable for teaching, very suitable for students' learning psychology, and easily accepted by students.

　　The results of a year of trial use have initially proved that this set of new textbooks is superior to the old textbooks and can indeed help us improve students' knowledge level. It has already won the sincere support of the majority of middle school students and teachers in the Northeast. The new textbook is not only suitable for teaching psychology, but each book also explains its teaching goals at the beginning. Therefore, after using the new textbook, the first thing is to enable students to have a clear understanding of the purpose of learning various natural science subjects, thereby improving students' awareness and enthusiasm for learning and making them develop a strong love and interest in natural science learning. Among our middle school students, the practice of automatically doing scientific experiments and observations in their spare time has begun to develop. Physics, which used to be a headache, has now become a popular subject for everyone; botany classes, which used to be dry and tasteless, have now become subjects loved by students. After learning the new botany textbook, many students expressed that they want to be agronomists and be China's Michurin. The result of conscious and active learning is the improvement of students' knowledge level. Last year's exam results were better than the previous year, the number of students who received excellent grades increased greatly, and the number of students who failed decreased significantly. More importantly, the scientific knowledge learned is relatively systematic and can be understood and comprehended. For example, in a surprise test in the physics class of the third grade of the second year at Lüda Normal School, students were asked to write about their understanding of Archimedes' principle. As a result, 29 students wrote systematic and comprehensive understandings. A student named Zhao Deyou wrote an essay of nearly 3,000 words on learning Archimedes' principle, which was rich in content and correct.

　　The fundamental factors that determine the quality of teaching are the quality of the teaching materials and the quality of the teachers. The basic reason why natural science teaching in Northeast middle schools was able to improve students' knowledge level and achieve the goal of improving teaching quality last year was, on the one hand, the change to more suitable textbooks, and on the other hand, the improvement of teachers' quality through the research and use of textbooks, enabling them to begin to abandon old teaching viewpoints and old teaching methods, and try to use advanced scientific theories, dialectical materialist viewpoints, and new teaching methods to improve teaching. After the trial use of the new textbook last year, we called on and organized natural science teachers to implement the slogan of "teach what you learn," "learn before teaching," and "learn while teaching," and to take the research of new teaching materials as the center of teaching research, and to study how to improve teaching. In the process of learning and research, teachers gradually armed their minds with the advanced scientific theory and dialectical materialist viewpoints of the new textbook, the method of linking theory with practice, and gradually learned to use the advanced theory, new viewpoints, and new methods of the new textbook to replace the old teaching viewpoints and old teaching methods. Therefore, after changing to the new textbook, the natural science teaching methods of middle schools and normal schools in the Northeast region also followed in the improvement, and began to overcome the cramming teaching method of formalism, paying attention to questioning, reviewing, and helping students understand the knowledge they have learned; universal emphasis is placed on intuitive teaching, that is, paying attention to experimental, observational, and internship teaching activities, and teachers and students have been doing things themselves to overcome difficulties and create teaching equipment, and self-made simple instruments, models, and specimens have become the norm. Teachers have achieved mutual growth in teaching in this way, improving both themselves and their students. Many teachers said in their teaching summaries last year: "Now, if we leave the new textbook, we will not be able to teach well."

　　This fact tells us a truth: that is, changing the teaching content (teaching materials) is the key to improving teaching. From this, it can be seen that if we want to improve the teaching of various subjects in the future, the primary problem is to change the teaching content of each subject, that is, to compile new teaching materials, and to use new teaching materials as weapons to improve teaching. This is a little experience we have gained from using the new textbook on a trial basis.

　　It must be pointed out that the current use of such a newly compiled natural science textbook is only a transitional method, and the fundamental method is of course to compile our own new textbooks separately. Although this set of newly compiled textbooks still has many shortcomings and is not completely applicable, a year of teaching practice has proved that they are better than the old textbooks, have undeniable advantages, and are basically suitable. Then, in the future, we should use them as a blueprint, learn and adopt the advanced scientific theories, dialectical materialist viewpoints, the principle of linking theory with practice, and the basic teaching laws of this set of textbooks, and compile our own textbooks according to China's national conditions and middle school teaching practices, and using the scientific achievements of our nation and the actual data of production and construction.

　　I believe that under the leadership of the Central People's Government, in the near future, a new set of natural science textbooks that completely conforms to Mao Zedong Thought and meets the requirements of the New Democracy education policy will be produced.

### 试用新编译的自然科学教科书的体验

　　试用新编译的自然科学教科书的体验
    东北人民政府教育部副部长　董纯才
    东北区的中学在转入正规之后，就感觉到中学课程与教材有改革的必要。早在一九四八年，我们就已着手翻译苏联中学用的自然科学教科书，原意是打算作为自然科学教学与自编新教科书的参考之用。到一九四九年秋，我们发现中学功课繁重，精简课程和修改教科书，就变成了刻不容缓的迫切要求。
    对于自然科学教科书究竟应如何修改呢？当时摆在我们面前的有两条办法：一个是修改旧有的教科书，一个是以新译的苏联中学用的自然科学教科书为蓝本，加以适当改编。两相比较的结果，我们决定舍弃前一条办法，采用后一条办法。理由是旧教科书的观点、材料与方法比较陈旧，新编译的苏联中学教科书的观点、材料与方法都比较进步，和东北中学生的程度也相接近。于是我们就集中了一批编译人员与教学人员，加以校阅，并略加改编。自一九五○年起，初中算术、代数、植物、动物、物理、化学、几何等科，就开始试用新编译的教科书。
    这套新教科书比旧教科书有这样几个公认的优点：一是以最先进的科学理论知识为内容（如动植物课本即以先进的米邱林生物学理论为基础），并给自然界生活及其发展规律以辩证唯物主义的阐明（如在物理学课本中从开始就注意在讲述物理学知识当中贯彻这样的唯物主义世界观的基本观念：世界的物质性，自然现象的相互联系，以及它们间的因果关系等）。二是理论与实际联系，贯串着学以致用的精神；即把课本所讲的科学原理与工、农业生产相联系起来，作为学生了解生产理论的基础。如讲植物学原理就联系到农业生产及改造植物的问题，讲化学原理就联系到化学工业的某些基本问题，讲物理学原理就联系到工业中的机械、电气等基本问题。同时还很注重教学实践，即注意实验、观察、实习，使学生从科学实验、观察与实习中，来印证、体验、领会科学知识。三是适合教学原则。这套教科书根据由浅入深，由简到繁，由已知到未知，由具体到抽象等教学法则来编排教材，处理问题。因此，很适合于教学，很适合学生的学习心理，容易被学生接受。
    经过一年试用的结果，初步证明了这套新教科书是优于旧教科书的，确能帮助我们提高学生知识水平，已经获得东北广大中学生与教员的真诚拥护。新教科书不仅是适合教学心理，而且每种书都在卷首说明它的教学目标。因此，试用新教科书后，首先是使学生对自然科学各科学习的目的都有了明确的认识，因而提高了学生学习的自觉性与积极性，使他们对自然科学学习发生了强烈的爱好与兴趣。在我们的中学生中已开始养成课余自动作科学实验、观察的风气。过去使人头痛的物理学，现在已变成为人人欢迎的功课了；过去使人感觉干燥无味的植物课，现在已变成为学生所爱好的功课了。好些学生学习新植物课本后就表示要做农学家，要做中国的米邱林。自觉地、积极地学习的结果，就是学生知识水平的提高。去年考试成绩比前年好，得优等成绩的人数大大增加，不及格的人数大为减少。更重要的是所学的科学知识比较有系统，而且能有所理解、领会。例如旅大师范，在二年级第三班物理课临时测验中让学生写出对阿基米德原理的体会，结果二十九个学生都写出了系统的全面的认识。一个叫赵德佑的学生写出了近三千字的一篇关于学习阿基米德原理的内容充实而且正确的论文。
    决定教学质量的根本因素，一个是教材的质量，一个是教师的质量。去年东北中学自然科学教学所以能提高学生的知识水平，达到提高教学质量的目的，其基本原因，一方面是改用了较适合的教科书，另一方面是通过教科书的研究与使用提高了教师的质量，使他们开始抛弃旧的教学观点与旧的教学方法，试用先进的科学理论、辩证唯物观点与新的教学方法，来进行改进教学。去年试用新教科书后，我们就号召与组织自然科学教员实行“教什么学什么”，“先学后教”，“边教边学”的口号，以研究新教材为教学研究的中心，研究如何改进教学的问题。在学习研究的过程中，教师们就逐渐以新教科书的先进科学理论、辩证唯物观点，理论与实际相联系的方法，来武装自己的头脑，并逐渐学会运用新教科书的先进理论，新观点与新方法来代替旧的教学观点与旧的教学方法。因而在改用新教科书之后，东北区中学、师范的自然科学教学法也就跟着在改进中，开始在克服填鸭式的教学生死读硬记的形式主义教学法，注意提问、复习，帮助学生理解领会所学知识；普遍重视直观教学，即注意实验、观察、实习等教学活动，师生纷纷自己动手，克服困难，创造教学设备，自制简单的仪器、模型、标本，已成风气。教师们就这样做到了教学相长，既提高了自己又提高了学生。好些教员在去年做教学总结时说：“现在要离开新教科书，就教不好书。”
    这一事实告诉给我们一个真理：这就是改变教学内容（教材）是改进教学的决定关键。由此可见，今后要改进各科教学，首要的问题，是改变各科教学内容，即编辑新教材，以新教材作为改进教学的武器。这是我们试用新教科书所得的一点体验。
    必须指出，目前使用这样新编译的自然科学教科书，只不过是个过渡办法，根本办法当然是要另编我们自己的新教科书。这套新编译的教科书，虽说还有很多缺点，并不完全适用，但一年的教学实践已证明：它们比旧教科书好，有不可抹煞的优越性，并且基本上是合用的。那么，今后就应当以它们作蓝本，学习与采用这套教科书的先进的科学理论，辩证唯物主义的观点，理论与实践联系的原则以及基本教学法则，根据中国国情和中学教学实践，运用我们民族自己的科学成就与生产建设实际资料来编辑我们自己的教科书。
    我相信，在中央人民政府的领导下，在不久的将来将会产生这样一套完全合乎毛泽东思想的合乎新民主主义教育方针与要求的新的自然科学教科书。
