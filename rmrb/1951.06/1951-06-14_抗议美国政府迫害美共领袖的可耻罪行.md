　　Protesting the American Government's Shameful Crimes of Persecuting American Communist Leaders
    The U.S. Supreme Court's approval of maintaining the fascist crime of illegally sentencing eleven leaders of the American Communist Party is the most tyrannical infringement and deprivation of the American people's basic democratic rights. The American Communist Party has waged and continues to wage a resolute and unyielding struggle to defend the American people's political and economic rights and lasting world peace. Especially in the past year, the American Communist Party has strived to awaken the broad masses of the American people, resolutely opposed the unjust war of American aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and continuously exposed the U.S. imperialists' schemes for madly preparing for war. This has made the American people increasingly aware, and the warmongers have become more isolated among the people. The American reactionary government's unreasonable persecution of American Communist leaders is an attempt to strike at the American people's forces for defending peace, to stop the development of the peace movement, and to drive the American people to serve as cannon fodder for its war of aggression. The American government's shameful verdict on the American Communist leaders fully exposes it as the irreconcilable enemy of the American people and all peace-loving people around the world.
    This fascist atrocity by the American government will only make peace-loving people of the world and the American people even more angry, and further awaken a wider range of the American people. American Communist leader Dennis has firmly declared: "No matter what happens, the Communist Party will continue to work to unite the American people against the monopoly capitalists and their political agents who are trying to plunge our country into the disaster of a third world war." The American people's movement to protest the American government's persecution of American Communist leaders continues to develop. At the same time, the American people's movement to defend peace and oppose war is also growing stronger. Since March 15, sixty new peace councils and committees have been established across the United States; the National Peace Crusade Committee has also decided to hold one thousand rallies in June to strive for peace in Korea. This increasingly vigorous and powerful action of the American people to strive for peace and oppose fascism concretely shows that the broad masses of the American people have understood that they must strengthen their struggle to defend their democratic rights and rescue their country from the hands of the warmongers.
    The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world resolutely support the heroic struggle of the American Communist Party and the American Communist leaders, and resolutely oppose the illegal persecution of them by the American reactionary government. We will support the heroic struggle of the American people and the American Communist Party with resolute actions to defend world peace and oppose American aggression, so as to completely smash the fascist conspiracies of the American reactionaries.

　　抗议美国政府迫害美共领袖的可耻罪行
    美国最高法院批准维持对美国共产党十一位领袖非法判决的法西斯罪行，乃是对美国人民基本民主权利最横暴的侵害与剥夺。美国共产党为保卫美国人民的政治、经济的权利和世界的持久和平，曾进行了并且还在继续进行着坚决不懈的斗争。尤其是最近一年以来，美国共产党努力唤醒广大的美国人民，坚决反对美国侵略朝鲜、台湾的不义战争，并不断地揭露了美国帝国主义疯狂备战的阴谋，这就使得美国人民日益觉醒，战争贩子们在人民当中更加孤立。美国反动政府对美国共产党领袖的无理迫害，是妄图打击美国人民保卫和平的力量，阻止保卫和平运动的发展，以驱使美国人民充当其侵略战争的炮灰。美国政府对美共领袖的可耻判决，充分暴露了它是美国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的不共戴天的敌人。
    美国政府的这一法西斯暴行，只有使爱好和平的世界人民与美国人民更加愤怒，并使更广大的美国人民进一步觉醒起来。美共领袖但尼斯已坚决宣告：“不管发生什么事情，共产党都要继续努力，团结美国人民，反对那些力谋把我们的国家投入第三次世界大战的灾难的垄断资本家和他们的政治代理人。”美国人民抗议美国政府迫害美共领袖的运动正在继续发展，同时，美国人民保卫和平、反对战争的运动也正在不断地壮大。三月十五日以来，美国全国已建立了六十个新的和平理事会及委员会；美国全国和平十字军委员会并决定在六月份举行一千个争取朝鲜和平的集会。美国人民争取和平、反对法西斯化的这种日益蓬勃而有力的行动，具体地显示出广大的美国人民已经懂得，必须以加强斗争来捍卫自己的民主权利，并从战争贩子们的手中把自己的国家拯救出来。
    中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，坚决支持美国共产党和美共领袖的英勇斗争，坚决反对美国反动政府对他们的非法迫害。我们将以保卫世界和平、反对美国侵略的坚决行动，来支援美国人民和美国共产党的英勇斗争，以彻底粉碎美国反动派的法西斯阴谋。
