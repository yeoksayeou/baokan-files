　　Central Huai River Inspection Group Arrives in Yangzhou

　　The Central Huai River Inspection Group, led by Deputy Head Shao Lizi, arrived in Yangzhou from Bengbu on the morning of May 31. Responsible comrades from the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office, the Northern Jiangsu Military Region, and the CPC Northern Jiangsu District Committee, as well as representatives from local government agencies and people's organizations, totaling more than 700 people, went to the station to welcome them. Li Honglai, a first-class model worker in Huai River management, and more than ten others, having heard that "representatives sent by Chairman Mao have arrived," traveled overnight from more than 200 miles away in the rain to welcome them. That evening, the Northern Jiangsu District Party and government leading bodies held a welcome meeting with more than a thousand people. The inspection group will listen to the report from the Northern Jiangsu Huai River management leading body regarding the reinforcement project of the dike of the lower reaches of the Huai River—the Liyun Canal—and then go to the areas along the canal for on-the-spot inspection.
