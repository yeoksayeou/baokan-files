　　Everyone Should Know the Heroic Fighting of the Volunteer Army
Editor:
    On the evening of May 31st, I listened to the report of the representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall in Beijing, and I gained a deeper understanding of the situation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea. I believe that this kind of report should be heard by every person in the country, as it is of profound educational significance. It would be best to hold a nationwide broadcast lecture, organizing the people to listen, just like the broadcast accusation meeting against counter-revolutionaries held in Beijing a few days ago.
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army at the front once told our comrades in the慰问团 (Comforting Delegation): "Please tell the people of the motherland that as long as our stomachs are full and we have weapons, we guarantee victory!" Is there a lower requirement than this? Is there a more courageous and confident guarantee than this? We, the people living peacefully in the country, must also resolutely guarantee that not a single member of the Volunteer Army will go hungry or be cold, and even more so that they will not fight the enemy with inferior weapons.
    We should put forth more effort, increase production, increase income, and support the Volunteer Army. If each of us contributes one jin (approximately 500g) of rice, our Volunteer Army will be well-fed. The strength of one person is small, but when all the Chinese people act in unison, it is an incomparably powerful force.

　　应该让每一个人都知道志愿军英勇作战的情形编辑同志：
    五月三十一日晚我在北京中山公园音乐堂听了中国人民赴朝慰问团代表的报告，对于在朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军的情况，有了更深一层的了解。我认为，这种报告应该让全国每个人民都听见，这是有深切教育意义的。最好能举办全国性的广播讲演，组织人民收听，如前些日子北京举办的对反革命分子的广播控诉会一样。
    在前线的中国人民志愿军曾告诉我们慰问团的同志说：“请转告祖国的人民，我们只要肚子吃得饱，只要有武器，我们保证打胜仗！”还有比这个更低的要求吗？还有比这个更勇敢更有信心的保证吗？我们在国内过着和平日子的人民，也要坚决的保证，不叫一个志愿军挨饿、受冻，更不叫他们使用着劣等的武器和敌人作战。
    我们应该更多地拿出力量，增加生产，增加收入，支援志愿军。我们每人献出一斤米，我们的志愿军就吃得饱饱的了。我们一个人的力量小，全中国人民一致行动起来，就是个强大无比的力量。
