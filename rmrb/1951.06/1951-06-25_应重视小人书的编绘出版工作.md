To the Editor:

　　Recently, movie lianhuanhua (i.e., turning a movie into a series of pictures) have become very popular in Beijing. Many streets and alleys have shops or stalls that rent these books. Because the rental price is cheap and they can be taken home to read, they have a large and very wide readership, such as apprentices, clerks, small businessmen, housewives, middle and primary school students, rickshaw pullers, etc. This is an art form that is very popular among the masses. Among the published movie lianhuanhua, there are some works with educational significance, such as "Red Flag Song" and "Glorious Family," but the number of such works is really too small. There are also some that are adapted from films produced by private Shanghai film companies before and after liberation, such as "Myriad of Lights," "The Story of My Life," "Happy Reunion," and "A River of Spring Flows East." Although these works still have some shortcomings in content, they still have a certain progressive significance; unfortunately, there are very few of such works. The vast majority of movie lianhuanhua are works with significant toxicity produced during the Kuomintang reactionary rule and Wang Jingwei's traitorous period before liberation, as well as those recently produced in Hong Kong, such as "Qing He Bo Ming" ("Why Are You So Ill-fated?"), "Red Powder Drifting," "Wind, Moon, Love, and Hate," "I Am Inherently Sentimental," etc. One can tell from the titles that their content is vulgar. There are also "Ancient Costume Blockbusters," "New Mei Longzhen," "One Night Queen," etc., which praise feudal emperors indulging in the three palaces and six courtyards and then going to the folk to play "romantic" stories. Even more, there are "Women Must Marry," "Peach Blossoms Still Smile in the Spring Breeze," which contain the same toxins as Hollywood movies, and "Corpse" and "Gunshots in the Rainy Night," which follow the example of Sherlock Holmes. What is even more intolerable is the open praise of the Kuomintang reactionaries' so-called "underground workers," such as "Pink Bomb" and "Return of the Earth," which blatantly and shamelessly portray the Chiang Kai-shek gang's "underground workers" and Blue Shirts Society agents as "anti-Japanese," "patriotic, upright, brave, and resourceful" fighters. These reactionary movie lianhuanhua that promote lust, praise the enemy, and reverse black and white actually occupy an "overwhelming advantage" in quantity. This phenomenon cannot but attract the attention of the relevant departments.

　　The masses urgently need to see movie lianhuanhua with progressive content, but why do these backward things still have many readers? The reason is not surprising, because there are few progressive works, and readers have to use these toxic works to satisfy their hunger and thirst. So, on the one hand, they shake their heads and say that these works are not good, and on the other hand, they still rent them to read.

　　In this situation, literary and artistic workers should actively take responsibility to change it. We must not let this position be occupied by reactionary and backward ideas. I suggest:

　　1. The leading organs related to lianhuanhua should conduct organized investigation and research, deeply understand the publication, distribution, and rental of movie lianhuanhua in detail, and strengthen their leadership over them. 2. It is hoped that the Film Bureau and the publishing sector will cooperate to promptly compile and print excellent feature films and news documentaries into movie lianhuanhua, publish and distribute them in large quantities, and pay attention not only to distribution to various cities but also to distribution to the vast rural areas. Because the peasants who have been liberated have a more urgent need for cultural food. 3. Strictly prohibit the publication and distribution of counter-revolutionary works, and order the complete recall of reactionary works that have been published and distributed. Appropriate criticism and restrictions should be given to works with backward content. Reward the printing of excellent people's movies into movie lianhuanhua, and provide assistance in many ways to give it more readers. 4. Vigorously promote the established experience of publishing and distributing movie lianhuanhua.

To the Editor:

　　The movie lianhuanhua "Third Blow," published by Shanghai Tongkang Bookstore and distributed by Lianlian Bookstore, is adapted from the Soviet film "Third Blow," but it is full of errors. What is most intolerable is, for example, the German commander and Hitler dialogue: "If we are killed, please posthumously recognize me as a Communist." (Page 330) Can the title of Communist be insulted and distorted in this way? Also, for example, saying that the Kremlin in Red Square is "Residents have fled, because the German army has been designated as a restricted area." When did Moscow "residents" ever "flee"? When was it designated as a "restricted area" by the German army? Other examples include annotating the image of the Soviet army in the picture as the Nazi army (pages 227, 229, 252, 288), and those wearing Nazi helmets become the Soviet army (page 294); all the words of the Soviets become "Egyptians." The American soldiers in the painting are still boasting about American equipment and "victory" (12th picture); praising the "innocence" of the soldiers of Lee Seung-man (17th picture); scolding "This damned place of Korea," "Even eggs are smaller than American ones," etc. through the mouth of American soldiers, conveying the idea of admiring America. Why is it allowed to publish such a bad comic book?

To the Editor:

　　Recently, our library purchased the lianhuanhua "Young Master Soldier," published by Taixing Bookstore and distributed by Shanghai Lianlian Bookstore, and written by Yi Min, from the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch. The content of this lianhuanhua is so bad that it is intolerable. We also saw Comrade Ji Chengwen's opinion on this lianhuanhua published on the fifth page of the Beijing Evening News on May 12. After joint discussion by the cadres of our library, we believe that the continued distribution of this painting should be strictly prohibited. This painting describes Park Young-won, a female student from "South Korea." "Using her wisdom and courage, she used the power of the people to transform the American officer Marat from a stubborn aggressor" into a progressive revolutionary comrade. These exposed the author's serious pro-American and worship-America ideas and completely lost the standpoint of the Chinese people. Confusing friend and foe insulted the Korean people. The author described Marat as "an American officer with humanity." We believe that the author does not hate or despise the brutal nature of the enemy, but sympathizes with or even worships them.

　　Why didn't the author Yi Min describe the heroic struggle of the Korean people, but insisted on describing two people who completely lost their national standpoint? Also, the author said that the Korean People's Army's policy of treating prisoners with leniency was "God's grace." The most inappropriate thing is that the author finally drew Park Young-won and Marat under the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea! We suggest that the distribution of this comic book should be stopped immediately, and the publishing house and the author of the painting should make a public self-criticism.

Editor's Note: Lianhuanhua are the most beloved reading material for the masses. There are many lianhuanhua published in various places now. Among them, many are good and should be introduced and recommended; for lianhuanhua with harmful content, they must be criticized. The content of some lianhuanhua mentioned by the readers above have serious errors. The readers' criticism should attract the attention of those engaged in the compilation and publication of lianhuanhua. We hope that the relevant authorities in various places will strengthen their leadership over this work.

### 应重视小人书的编绘出版工作

专栏：读者来信

　　应重视小人书的编绘出版工作编辑同志：
    最近电影小人书（即把一部电影印成连环图画）在北京很盛行。许多大街上和巷子里都有出租这类书的铺子或小摊。因为租价便宜，又可拿回家看，所以它拥有大量的非常广泛的读者，如学徒、店员、小商人、家庭妇女、中小学生、三轮工人等。这是一种群众很喜爱的艺术形式。在已出版的电影小人书里，有一些富有教育意义的作品，如《红旗歌》、《光荣人家》等，但这样的作品在数量上实在太少了。还有一些是照着解放前后上海私营影片公司出品编成的，如《万家灯火》、《我这一辈子》，《大团圆》、《一江春水向东流》等，这些作品虽在内容上还存有某些缺点，但还有它一定的进步意义；可惜这类作品也为数很少。绝大多数的电影小人书都是解放前蒋介石反动统治时期和汪精卫卖国时期，以及近来香港摄制的有着重大毒害的作品，像《卿何薄命》、《红粉飘零》、《风月恩仇》、《侬本痴情》等，一看名字便知其内容是庸俗不堪的作品；又有像《古装巨片》、《新梅龙镇》、《一夜皇后》等歌颂封建帝王在皇宫里玩腻了三宫六院，又跑到民间去耍一番“风流”的故事影片；更有与好莱坞影片含有同样毒素的《女大当嫁》、《桃花依旧笑春风》与向福尔摩斯看齐的《艳尸》《雨夜枪声》等等；尤其令人难以容忍的是公开歌颂国民党反动派的所谓“地下工作者”的，如《粉红色的炸弹》、《大地回春》，它们明目张胆，而又恬不知耻地把蒋介石匪帮的“地下工作者”和蓝衣社特务们描写成为“抗日”、“爱国、正直、勇敢、机智”的战斗者。这些宣扬淫欲、歌颂敌人、颠倒黑白的反动电影小人书竟在数量上占着“压倒的优势”。这种现象，不能不提起有关方面的注意。
    群众迫切需要看进步内容的电影小人书，但这些落后的东西为什么还拥有不少读者呢？这原因并不奇怪，因为进步的作品少，读者不得不拿这些有毒害的作品充饿渴。于是一面摇头说这些作品不好，一面还是租来看。
    这种情况，文艺工作者是应当积极地负起责任来使之改变。我们不要把这块阵地让给反动和落后思想盘据着。我建议：
    一、与小人书有关的领导机关，应有组织地进行调查研究，深入了解电影小人书的出版、发行及出租的详细情形，并对之加强领导；二、希望电影局和出版方面合作，及时地把优秀的故事片及新闻纪录片编印成电影小人书，大量出版和发行，并注意不但发行到各城市，更需要发行到广大农村去。因为翻身后的农民对文化食粮的需要更迫切。三，严禁反革命作品的出版和发行，对已出版发行的反动作品，应即勒令使其全部收回；对于落后内容的作品，应予以适当的批评和限制。奖励优秀的人民电影印为电影小人书，多方面给以帮助，使它获得更多的读者。四、大力推广电影小人书的出版、发行的既得经验。
            冯湘漪编辑同志：
    上海同康书局出版，连联书店发行的电影小人书“第三次打击”是根据苏联电影《第三次打击》缩编的，但是内中错误百出，最使人不能容忍的，例如德寇司令和希特勒对话说：“如果我们被打死，请追认我为共产党人。”（第三三○页）难道共产党员的称号，可以这样加以侮辱和歪曲的吗？又如把红场的克林姆里宫说成“居民已逃避一空，因为德军已划为警戒区。”请问什么时候莫斯科“居民”曾经“逃避一空”？什么时候被德军划为“警戒区”呢？其它如把画中的苏联军队的形象注释成为纳粹军队（二二七页，二二九页，二五二页、二八八页），戴着纳粹钢盔的却成为苏联军队（二九四页）；所有苏维埃的字样都变成“苏埃及”。画中的美国兵仍然在夸耀美国的装备和“胜利”（十二图）；称赞李承晚的士兵的“天真”（十七图）；借美国兵之口骂“朝鲜这个鬼地方”、“连鸡蛋都比美国小”等的崇美思想。为什么容许这种恶劣的连环画出版呢？
              鹤岗市第五完全小学校  校长  张浩程编辑同志：
    我馆在最近，从新华书店北京分店买了上海连联书店发行，泰兴书局出版，翼民编稿的连环图画“少爷兵”，这本连环图画的内容坏到让人不能容忍。我们又看到北京晚报五月十二日第五版、姬承文同志对此连环图画所发表的意见又经过我馆干部共同讨论，我们认为应该严禁这本画继续发行。这本画是描写“南朝鲜”女学生朴永媛。“用她的智慧和勇敢，以人民的力量使美军官马拉特从一个顽固的侵略分子”一变而为前进的革命同志。这些暴露了作者严重的亲美、崇美思想而且完全丧失了中国人民的立场。敌我分不清侮辱了朝鲜人民。作者把马拉特描写成“有人性的美国军官”。我们认为作者对敌人的残暴的本质，不是仇视、鄙视、而是同情甚至崇拜。
    作者翼民为什么不描写朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，偏来这样描写两个完全丧失民族立场的人呢？还有作者把朝鲜人民军优待俘虏的政策说成是“上帝的恩典”。最不妥当的是：作者最后还把朴永媛和马拉特画在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗的下面！我们建议：这本连环画应即停止发行，出版的书局和画的作者应作公开检讨。
          北京市门头沟文化馆  李希昌
    编者按：小人书是广大群众最喜爱的读物，现在各地出版的小人书的数目是很多的。其中不少是好的，应该加以介绍推荐；对于内容有害的小人书就必需批评。上面读者所提到的一些小人书的内容都有严重的错误，读者的批评，应当引起从事编绘出版小人书工作者的注意。我们希望各地有关机关对这项工作加强领导。
