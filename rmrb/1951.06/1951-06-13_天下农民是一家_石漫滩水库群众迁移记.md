　　All Farmers Under Heaven are One Family
    ——A Record of the Mass Relocation from the Shihmantan Reservoir
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Yú Mínshēng
    After the completion of the Shihmantan Reservoir, the land of six villages within the reservoir's water storage area would be submerged. Therefore, simultaneously with the construction of the reservoir, it was necessary to relocate the farmers of these villages and provide them with proper resettlement.
    Before the relocation work began, some cadres considered the work to be easy, but after a detailed understanding, they discovered that the farmers had many concerns. For example, the farmers feared being allocated bad land in other villages, feared that the government could not guarantee their original living standards, feared being ostracized in other villages, feared being too scattered from their village friends and neighbors after relocation, and feared that the farmers in the plains would look down on the people from the mountains, etc. The elderly had even more concerns; they were reluctant to leave their neighbors and relatives who had lived in the same village for generations; some even lost their appetite and could not sleep because of this.
    In order to successfully complete this relocation task, the local government, after determining the relocation sites, specially selected government work cadres from the relocation and resettlement areas to form a unified relocation and resettlement committee. At the same time, group leaders were elected from every five households in the relocation area, under the leadership of the relocation and resettlement committee, to carry out the work in a unified manner. In response to the above-mentioned ideological situation of the relocating farmers, the relocation and resettlement committee successively convened meetings of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, farmer representatives, and elderly people in the relocation area, as well as a general meeting of relocating farmers, etc., to widely publicize the government's relocation and compensation policies. At these meetings, the person in charge of the relocation and resettlement committee first explained to the farmers: building a reservoir to store water and relocating the farmers in the water storage area were all in order to reduce the flood disasters suffered by tens of millions of farmers in the lower reaches of the Huai River; the People's Government guaranteed that after the relocating households arrived in the resettlement area, everyone would have a house to live in, everyone would have land to cultivate, and the standard of living would not be reduced; the damaged crops would be compensated by the government at the assessed price. Then, the relocation addresses were announced, and the cadres introduced the soil quality and the situation of the masses in the resettlement area. After everyone's discussion, the thinking of the farmers in the relocation area was gradually cleared; the Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in each village were the first to propose setting an example and promoting others in the relocation work; the representatives attending the meeting also stated that in addition to being willing to relocate themselves, they would also go to persuade the farmers who were unwilling to move. Everyone unanimously put forward a slogan: "Listen to Chairman Mao, trust the People's Government."
    While the government of the relocation area was holding meetings, the various resettlement areas were also preparing for the resettlement of the relocating farmers.
    Most of the farmers in the water storage area of the Shihmantan Reservoir were to be relocated to the Wugong, Wucheng, Baohe, Batai, and Shangdian districts of Wuyang County. These areas had undergone rent reduction, anti-despot, bandit suppression, and land reform movements after liberation, and the farmers' political awareness was very high. This time, before starting to resettle the relocating households, Wuyang County first convened a county resettlement committee, where cadres from the relocation area introduced in detail the ideological concerns and requirements of the relocating farmers. Then, the various townships preparing to resettle the relocating farmers convened farmer representative meetings by township to specifically arrange the resettlement work. Taking Zhao Village Township in the Baohe District as an example: at the township's farmer representative meeting, the township's responsible cadre gave a detailed report on the significance of resettling the relocating households, and then the representatives spoke enthusiastically. Wang Guiying, a female representative, said: "The relocation of one household benefits everyone. They are doing this for us, they don't even want their homes, we must take good care of them."
    Next, the people's governments of each township announced the number of households and people each township was prepared to resettle, as well as the housing and land property of the relocating households. After the representatives of each village realized the importance of resettling the immigrants, they all enthusiastically reported the number of households that their village or individuals were willing to resettle. The land and housing problems, which the cadres in the resettlement area originally thought would be the most difficult to solve, were also solved under the enthusiastic discussion of the representatives. For example, one hundred and twenty representatives from Shangdian District voluntarily drew out four hundred mu of land to distribute to the relocating households; the representatives also discussed issues such as the future living of the relocating households and minor issues such as customs and habits.
    After the representatives returned to the village, a warm movement to resettle the immigrants was launched in each village. Villagers put wooden markers on each piece of land allocated to the relocating households, with the name of the relocating household, the amount of land, and the yield written on it; some village farmers also helped the relocating households plant cotton and yellow tobacco on the land. The houses prepared for the relocating households were also freshly painted, with red paper couplets pasted on the doors. The bullock carts in each village were also organized to help the relocating households move.
    In order to further dispel the ideological concerns of the relocating households, the farmers in the resettlement area, after everything was prepared, specially sent representatives to the relocation area to report on their preparations. Similarly, almost every household in the relocation area sent representatives to the resettlement area to identify the land. These representatives were warmly welcomed and entertained by the farmers in the resettlement area after arriving in the resettlement area. They saw with their own eyes that the farmers in the resettlement area had prepared everything properly, and that the land and houses were better than the original ones, and some land had already been planted with crops. All the original ideological concerns were eliminated at this point. The farmers who were initially determined not to relocate were now willing to move.
    In this way, the relocation began. Countless bullock carts gathered from the resettlement area to the relocation area. The farmers in the relocation area were all happy. Young women put on new clothes, old ladies sat on bullock carts, children held chickens, and everyone talked and laughed, happily heading to their new homes. The farmers in the resettlement area also beat gongs and drums and danced the yangge, as if they were encountering some great happy event, rushing to the road several miles away to welcome them; and helping them move things, carry luggage, and warmly inviting them to drink tea and eat.
    The relocation work of the six villages, two hundred and ninety-eight households, and one thousand three hundred and twenty farmers in the water storage area of the Shihmantan Reservoir was thus successfully and smoothly completed in forty days with the enthusiastic mutual assistance of the farmers in the various townships of the resettlement area. The relocating farmers are very satisfied with their new homes, and many of them have voluntarily written letters to Chairman Mao, thanking the People's Government and the masses in the resettlement area for their concern.

　　天下农民是一家
    ——石漫滩水库群众迁移记
    新华社记者　于民生
    石漫滩水库完成后，在水库蓄水区内，将有六个村庄的土地被淹没。因此，与修建水库的同时，必须把这些村庄的农民迁移出来，并加以妥善安置。
    迁移工作开始前，有的干部把这个工作看得轻而易举，但经过详细了解后，他们才发现农民存在着很多顾虑。譬如农民怕到外乡分坏地，怕政府不能保证他们原有的生活水平，怕到外乡受排斥，怕迁移后与本村友邻住得太分散，以及怕平原农民瞧不起山里人等等。年老的人顾虑更多，他们舍不得世代同住一村的邻友和亲戚；有的甚至为了这件事整日愁得吃不下饭，睡不好觉。
    为了顺利地完成这一迁移任务，当地政府在确定了迁移地点后，就特地抽调出迁移区和安置区的政府工作干部统一组织了迁移安置委员会。同时，又由迁移区的农民每五户中间选出一个小组长，在迁移安置委员会领导下，统一进行工作。针对迁移农民以上的思想情况，迁移安置委员会曾在迁移区连续地召开了共产党党员会、青年团团员会、农民代表会、老年人会，以及迁移农民大会等等，广泛宣传了政府的迁移和赔偿政策。在这些会议上，迁移安置委员会的负责人首先向农民们说明：修水库蓄水和迁移蓄水区的农民，都是为了减少淮河下游地区的几千万农民所受的洪水灾害；人民政府保证迁移户到达安置区后人人有房子住，人人有地种，生活水平也不会降低；被损害的庄稼，政府照价赔偿。接着，便宣布了迁移地址，并由干部介绍安置区的土质和群众情况。经过大家讨论后，迁移区农民的思想逐渐被打通；各村的共产党员和青年团员们首先提出要在迁移工作中以身作则和推动别人；参加会议的代表们也表示除自己愿意迁移外，还要分头去说服不愿搬家的农民。大家一致提出一个口号：“听毛主席的话，相信人民政府。”
    在迁移区政府召开会议的同时，各个安置区亦进行了安置迁移农民的准备工作。
    石漫滩水库蓄水区的农民，大部分要迁移到舞阳县的武功、吴城、保和、八台、尚店等五个区。这些地区在解放后，曾经经过了减租、反恶霸、清剿土匪和土地改革运动，农民的政治觉悟很高。这次，舞阳县在开始安置迁移户以前，曾首先召开了县的安置委员会，由迁移区干部详细介绍了迁移农民的思想顾虑及其要求。接着，准备安置迁移农民的各乡又以乡为单位召开了农民代表会议，具体布置了安置工作。以保和区赵庄乡为例：在该乡农民代表会上，乡的负责干部曾就安置迁移户的意义作了一个详细的报告，接着，代表们都踊跃发言。妇女代表王桂英说：“移民是一户搬家，大家有利。人家为了咱，家都不要啦，咱一定得好好照顾人家。”
    接着，各乡人民政府宣布了各乡准备安置移民的户数和人口，以及迁移户的房屋和土地财产的情况。各村代表认识到安置移民的重要性以后，大家都踊跃地报告了他本村或个人愿意安置的户数。安置区干部们原先认为最难解决的土地、房屋问题，在代表们的热情讨论下也解决了。如尚店区的一百二十个代表就自动抽出了四百亩土地分给迁移户；就是迁移户今后的生活问题，以及风俗习惯等枝节问题，代表们也都进行了讨论。
    代表们回村后，一个热烈的安置移民运动便在各村展开了。村民们把一块块分给迁移户的土地，都插上了木标，上面写着迁移户的名字、地亩和产量；有的村农民并帮助迁移户在地上种了棉花和黄烟。准备分给迁移户的房屋也被粉刷一新，在门上贴了红纸对联。各村的牛车也被组织起来，准备帮助迁移户搬家。
    为了进一步解除迁移户的思想顾虑，安置区农民在一切都准备好了以后，又特地派了代表到迁移区去报告他们的准备情形。同样地，迁移区的农民也差不多每户都派有代表到安置区去认地。这些代表到安置区后受到安置区农民的热烈欢迎和招待，他们亲眼看到安置区农民把一切都已准备妥当，土地、房屋也比原来的好，有的地上已种上了庄稼，原有的思想顾虑至此全部消除了，起初坚决不愿迁移的农户，这时也愿意搬家了。
    就这样，迁移开始了。无数的牛车，从安置区汇集到迁移区来。迁移区的农民个个高兴。青年妇女穿起了新衣服，老太太坐在牛车上，小孩子抱着鸡，大家都有说有笑，欢欢喜喜地向新的家园走去。安置区的农民，也像遇到什么大喜事似地敲着锣鼓，扭着秧歌，赶到几里以外的大路上来迎接他们；并帮助他们搬东西，扛行李，热情地招待他们喝茶吃饭。
    石漫滩水库蓄水区的六个村庄，二百九十八户，一千三百二十个农民的迁移工作，就这样在安置区各乡农民的热情互助下，在四十天内完满而顺利地完成了。迁移农民对新的家园非常满意，他们当中已有许多人自动写信给毛主席，感激人民政府和安置区群众对他们的关怀。
