　　How Wu Ruose Established a Radio Listening Group?
　　Special correspondent of this newspaper He Jing
    The radio listening group of the Taiyuan Railway North Station Locomotive Depot has created a model for using radio listening to carry out propaganda and mobilization work in popularizing patriotic education to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Comrade Wu Ruose, a clerk in the depot, is an active newspaper and radio correspondent and was rewarded at the First Shanxi Provincial News and Art Award Conference in January this year. This award not only greatly encouraged Comrade Wu Ruose's enthusiasm but also promoted the radio listening work of various sections of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau.
    Since then, under the guidance of leading cadres, Comrade Wu Ruose began to overcome the style of working alone and became an excellent propagandist. At the beginning of March this year, he established two relatively sound radio listening groups in the machine tool group and the ironworker and welder group. After mid-March, he developed three more listening groups in the factory office, electrical engineering, and public security, with a total of 73 members. By the beginning of April, he had expanded the radio listening work to the families of employees. He united active radio listeners such as Wang Fenghai, Wang Yongfu, Liu Enping, Li Qingliang, Li Dahei, and Wang Dianxuan, giving play to the role of collective research and joint organization.
    Comrade Wu Ruose has great enthusiasm for this work. He took the radio he was awarded at the conference and bought another radio with the prize money for the listening group to use. He widely encouraged employees to participate in radio listening and explained the benefits of listening to the radio to everyone. At the same time, he took the initiative to establish close contact with the radio station and regularly posted radio programs on the blackboard bulletin. Whenever there was radio content related to the work of the depot, he paid special attention to organizing everyone to listen, and he announced it to everyone in advance with a loudspeaker and wrote the radio content on the blackboard bulletin with red and green chalk to attract everyone's attention. Employees gradually developed the habit of listening to the radio. The "Radio Program Forecast" on the blackboard bulletin became everyone's most concerning column.
    They also established listening rules and discipline. Each group takes turns listening. Each group elects a group leader, a radio recording officer, and a communication officer. After listening, they organize everyone to discuss and write communications and work reports to the radio station; sometimes, they also organize reading newspapers to supplement the content of the listening. Once, after they heard the news that a certain factory had caught a special agent, everyone said, "How could special agents have mixed into the workers' ranks? We must be vigilant!" At that time, probationary worker Sun Qingyun took the initiative to request to join the picket team (probationary workers are not obligated to join the picket team), and other employees used their spare time to shovel the grass near the water tower to prevent sabotage by special agents.
    After listening to the live broadcast of the meeting to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the workers not only put forward the slogan of preventing spies and special agents but also realized this slogan with patriotic actions. Everyone shouted, "Give play to the power of collective creation and do a good job in production." In less than half a month, the ironworker group found a way to manufacture a tool that could save coal and also increased work efficiency by two times; the welder group also created a rotating machine for repairing welding flue pipes, which increased work efficiency by two times.
    After listening to the speeches of the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, members of each listening group participated in the formulation of patriotic pledges. Li Qingliang's group also decided that each person would donate a certain amount of millet to the soldiers on the Korean front every month. After the comrades in the ironworker group signed the patriotic pledge, they automatically cleaned the slag coal outside the door. They said, "We want to sweep away the dirty things as cleanly as we eliminate the U.S. imperialist aggressors!"

　　吴若瑟是怎样建立广播收听小组的？
    本报特约记者  何静
    太原铁路北站机务段广播收听小组，在普及抗美援朝爱国主义教育中创造了利用收听广播进行宣传鼓动工作的范例。该段办事员吴若瑟同志是一个积极的报纸和广播通讯员，在今年一月份山西省第一届新闻文艺给奖大会上，受到了奖励。这次奖励，不仅大大地鼓励了吴若瑟同志的积极性，而且推动了太原路局各段的广播收听工作。
    从此以后，吴若瑟同志在领导干部的指导下，开始克服单人独马去干的作风，成为优秀的宣传员。他在今年三月初建立了机床组和铁工电焊组两个比较健全的广播收听组；三月中旬以后，又发展了工厂办公室、电机和公安三个收听组，共有组员七十三人。到四月初，他又把广播收听工作扩展到职工家属里面去。他团结了收听广播的积极分子王逢海、王永福、刘恩平、李清亮、李大黑、王殿选等人，发挥了集体研究和共同组织的作用。
    吴若瑟同志对这个工作有极大的热情。他主动地把大会上奖给的收音机拿出来，并且又用奖金买了一部收音机，供给收听组使用。他一面广泛地吸收职工同志参加收听广播，一面向大家解释收听广播的好处。同时，他主动地和广播电台取得密切联系，经常在黑板报上公布广播节目。遇有和本段工作有关的广播内容，他就特别注意组织大家收听，事先并用喇叭筒向大家预告，用红绿粉笔把广播内容写在黑板报上，引起大家的注意。职工同志们也逐渐地养成了收听广播的习惯。黑板报上的“广播节目预告”成为大家最关心的一栏。
    他们还订立了收听制度和纪律。各组轮流收听。每个组选出一个组长和一个广播记录干事、一个通讯干事。收听以后，组织大家讨论，向电台写通讯和工作汇报；有时还组织读报，补充收听的内容。有一次，他们收听到某厂捉到特务的消息，大家纷纷地说：“怎么工人队伍里也混进了特务？可得警惕呀！”试用工孙庆云当时主动要求参加纠察队（试用工没有参加纠察队的义务），并且和其他职工利用业余时间把水塔附近的草铲掉，防止特务的破坏活动。
    在收听了镇压反革命大会实况的转播以后，工人同志不仅提出了防奸细防特务的口号，而且用爱国主义的行动来实现这个口号。大家一齐喊出：“发挥集体创造的力量，搞好生产。”在不到半个月的时间内，铁工组设法制造了一种工具可以节省炭，还提高了工作效率两倍；电焊组也创制了一个修焊烟管的自转机，使工作效率提高了两倍。
    收听志愿军归国代表的讲话之后，各个收听小组的组员都参加了订立爱国公约。李清亮小组还决定每人每月拿出一定数量的小米捐献给朝鲜前线将士。铁工组同志在订了爱国公约之后，自动地打扫门外的炉渣炭。他们说：“我们要像消灭美帝国主义侵略军一样，把脏东西扫得干干净净！”
