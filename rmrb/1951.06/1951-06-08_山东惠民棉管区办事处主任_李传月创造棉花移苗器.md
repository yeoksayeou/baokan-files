　　Li Chunyue, director of the Huimin Cotton Management District Office in Shandong Province, recently created a pincer-shaped cotton transplanter, which has proven to be very suitable after testing. The efficiency of this transplanter is twice that of manual transplanting, and it can transplant more than 200 cotton seedlings per hour, with a very high survival rate. Recently, staff from the Huimin Cotton Management District conducted a field test of transplanting cotton seedlings in the Dongguan cotton field in Huimin City using the pincer-shaped transplanter, and the results were good. All 140 cotton seedlings transplanted with this transplanter survived after two days. The Huimin Cotton Management District has now begun to manufacture and promote this transplanter on a large scale for cotton farmers to use.

　　The structure of this pincer-shaped transplanter is very simple. The lower part of the transplanter has two valve-shaped iron pieces, nailed to the two jaws of a pair of iron pliers, forming a five-inch-high circular iron cylinder. The lower end of the iron cylinder has a blade to facilitate insertion into the soil. Each handle of the pliers has a horizontal wooden handle for gripping. The method of using the transplanter is as follows: hold the two wooden handles with your hands, first press down hard on the ground where seedlings are missing, and when the cylinder is full of soil, clamp down hard and take out the soil, leaving an empty pit in the ground. Then, in a place where cotton seedlings are dense, use the same method to dig out the cotton seedlings with the original soil, move them to the already dug empty pit, then remove the transplanter, and use your hands or feet to press the soil around the seedlings tightly, pour some water, and cover with a layer of fine soil, so that the cotton seedlings can survive. Cotton seedlings transplanted after rain do not need to be watered, just press the soil tightly around the seedlings.

    李传月创造棉花移苗器
    山东省惠民棉管区办事处主任李传月最近创造了一种钳形棉花移苗器，经试验结果，很为适用。这种移苗器移苗的效率较人工移苗可提高两倍，每小时能移植棉苗二百株以上，所移棉苗的成活率也很高。最近，惠民棉管区的工作人员曾用钳形移苗器在惠民城东关棉田中进行移苗的实地试验，结果良好。经这种移苗器所移植的一百四十株棉苗，两天后全部成活。现在，惠民棉管区已开始大量制造和推广这种移苗器，供棉农使用。
    这种钳形移苗器的构造很简单。移苗器的下面有两瓣瓦形的铁片，钉在一把铁钳的两个钳头上，形成一个五寸高的圆形铁筒。铁筒向下的一头有刃，以便插入土中。钳把上各横一木柄，作为把手。移苗器的使用法是：用手持两木柄，先在缺苗的地上加力压下，待圆筒土满，用力钳着将土取出，地上就成一空窝。然后在棉苗密的地方用同样的方法将棉苗带原土挖出，移到已掘好的空窝中，再取出移苗器，用手或脚将苗四周的土压紧，浇上些水，盖上一层细土，棉苗就能成活。下雨后移栽的棉苗可不浇水，只要压紧棉苗四周的土就行。
