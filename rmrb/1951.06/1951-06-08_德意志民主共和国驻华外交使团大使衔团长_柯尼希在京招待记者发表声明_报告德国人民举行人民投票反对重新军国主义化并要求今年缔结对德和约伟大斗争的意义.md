　　[Report from this newspaper] The struggle of the German people against rearmament has entered a new high point due to the people's vote held in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. The people's vote in the German Democratic Republic ended victoriously on the 5th of this month. The result of the vote shows that among the valid votes, 95.98 percent explicitly expressed opposition to German remilitarization and demanded the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany within 1951. This fully demonstrates that the vast majority of the German people are firmly opposed to rearmament. This is a serious blow to the US plot to arm West Germany in Europe and create war. Johann König, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China, held a reception for journalists in Beijing on the 7th and issued a statement on the great significance of this struggle of the German people.

　　Ambassador König first pointed out: "The German people have awakened and want to express clearly and firmly their opposition to German remilitarization and strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany within 1951. This people's vote is of great significance not only to the German people but also to all peace-loving people. For these reasons, Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, called on all the German people, in West Germany and in the German Democratic Republic, to express unanimously and powerfully, through a people's vote, the will to fight for peace, for a united, democratic, and peace-loving Germany."

　　Regarding the conspiracy of US imperialism to split Germany, arm the Bonn puppet army, and restore West Germany's arms industry, Ambassador König made the following analysis: The US ruling clique, as everyone knows, attempts to dominate the world and is preparing a new war of aggression. Their policy towards Germany is: to split Germany, revive German imperialism, rearm West Germany, restore the war economic potential of the Rhineland and Ruhr area, and turn West Germany into an advance base for their planned war of aggression. They disregard all legitimate international agreements and treaties concerning the handling of the German issue after the Second World War, especially the Potsdam Agreement; the terms of this agreement are in accordance with the will of all peoples, including the German people, and have been consistently adhered to by the peace-loving Soviet Union.

　　The imperialist occupying countries rely on the German monopoly capitalists who are filled with revenge, that is, on those reactionary forces that once brought Hitler to power, releasing German arms king and war criminal Krupp and restoring his former rights, which is a manifestation of their policy.

　　The Western occupying countries have split Germany and established a separate Bonn state. The head of the Bonn "government," Adenauer, is a well-known veteran revanchist politician. He has very close relations with the business tycoons in the Rhineland. He is an accomplice in the conspiracy of West German and American monopoly capitalists, faithfully carrying out their orders for remilitarization. The head of the West German Social Democratic Party, Schumacher, serves the same master. He attempts to use a disguised opposition facade to confuse the masses, so that they cannot see his actual support for the remilitarization policy. The policy of Adenauer and Schumacher is: to fascize West Germany, rectify military equipment, and prepare for a war of aggression.

　　Since the New York meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers in September 1950, the economic and military armament of West Germany has been openly accelerated. In West Germany, there are already German mercenary troops with various false names, such as: labor inspectorates, defense teams, labor brigades, German labor organization brigades, defense service brigades, border defense brigades, industrial police brigades, black guard brigades, etc.

　　The police reserve and border police have been established as completely militarized forces, led by former generals in Hitler's army, such as infantry general Anton Gasser and Hamburg anti-aircraft artillery commander General Gise. The training of the police reserve is entirely in accordance with the infantry training methods of Hitler's Wehrmacht. As reported by the West German "Bochum Newspaper" on April 21, 1951, these troops have been equipped with automatic pistols, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, and armored vehicles, and are fully mechanized. In order to accelerate the establishment of the German army, the Bonn government announced on April 17, 1951, that West Germany would be divided into twelve military districts, five conscription supervisory offices, and twenty-nine military sub-districts. The new conscription bureaus established in these military districts and conscription supervisory offices have already begun operations.

　　In addition, the establishment of a regularized German army (referring to the West German puppet army) is being prepared. Russell Hill, the Bonn correspondent of the "New York Herald Tribune," confirmed on April 13, 1951: "The plan to establish a German combat force of about twelve divisions and equipped with six hundred aircraft as tactical support is nearing completion." At the same time, "a navy for defending ports has also been planned. Plans for German troops armed with armored vehicles and anti-tank guns are also being prepared."

　　In December 1950, all barracks and airports in West Germany that had been used for civilian purposes were requisitioned. New airports, barracks, and training camps are under construction. According to the Mainz Social Democratic newspaper "Freiheit," four new airports have been built in the French occupation zone alone. At the same time, a large number of explosive devices have been installed in various strategic locations. According to the "Nuremberg Nachrichten" on February 17, 1951, explosive holes have been built on more than 630 bridges in West Germany.

　　West Germany has become a war base.

　　West Germany's economy is being transformed into armaments production. The production in industrial sectors that constitute the potential of a war economy is being promoted at the expense of civilian industry. According to official statistics in Bonn, the production index of industries that form the basis of armaments production in 1950 has reached an average monthly output of 120 percent of that in 1936, and the automotive industry (in other words, the armored vehicle industry) has even reached 150 percent of that in 1936. At the same time, the production of daily necessities has not even reached pre-war levels. Currently, the production volume of consumer goods has even shrunk.

　　The production of military supplies involves various enterprises in West Germany and West Berlin. Approximately thirty factories in West Germany are manufacturing parts or equipment for armored vehicles. About seventeen enterprises are producing aircraft and equipment, and about thirty-five enterprises are manufacturing artillery weapons, bullets, and explosives.

　　So far, the most egregious and consequential measure taken by the Adenauer "government" in arming West Germany has been its participation in the Schuman Plan. The Schuman Plan stipulates the establishment of a coal and steel union to control all coal mines and the steel industry of the participating countries, which is to realize the plan of the United States to establish an arsenal in Western Europe. The purpose it pursues is to accelerate the remilitarization of West Germany in order to establish a base for the war economy for the aggressive North Atlantic group in Europe. This is a conspiracy by American imperialists and the imperialists participating in the Schuman Plan, especially the West German monopoly capitalists, to undermine the peace and security of all peoples.

　　The monopoly capitalists of West Germany want to guarantee their huge share in the arms business in Western Europe, so they do not hesitate to trample on the interests of the German people. The Schuman Plan also means that the reactionaries are intensifying their atrocities against the working people of West Germany and West Berlin.

　　The living standards of the working people of West Germany are declining, while the prices of food and daily necessities are rising rapidly. Within two years, the price of bread has increased by 50 percent, beef by 104 percent, margarine by 45 percent, sugar by 40 percent, and so on. Housing costs, household coal, transportation, water, electricity, and gas have all become more expensive. In addition, there is speculative price gouging of industrial daily necessities that are in short supply due to the expansion of armaments. So far, the 1951 tax regulations amount to 23.4 billion East Marks, which means that each person has to bear about 500 Marks, which is already more than one-third of 1950.

　　At the same time, the profits of major corporations are rising. The capital of 136 corporations has increased from 246.71 million to 313.22 million. Due to the increase in stock value, the profits of West German monopoly capital have increased by at least 1.75 times. This is the arms business of monopoly capitalists.

　　In the economic decline where the evil consequences of Hitler's war have not yet been eliminated, the rearmament of West Germany will inevitably sharpen the opposition between the West German arms manufacturers and their Bonn government and the working people. The movements to increase wages, movements to protest unreasonable wage rates, and strikes are increasing day by day in West Germany. Workers, employees, and farmers are protesting against rising prices and constantly increasing taxes."

　　Ambassador König finally pointed out: "The vast majority of the entire German people reject the war plans of the United States. The people's movement against remilitarization is increasingly spreading to all levels of the German people.

　　In January of this year, a significant anti-remilitarization conference of 1,700 representatives from all walks of life of the German people was held in Essen, the center of the Ruhr area. In Düsseldorf, Rhineland-Westphalia, a Central Committee for the People's Vote was established. In accordance with the resolutions of the Essen Peace Congress, it demanded a people's vote on opposition to remilitarization and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany within 1951. The Bonn cabinet, which is implementing remilitarization, rejected the proposal of the Düsseldorf Central Committee to implement a people's vote, because it knows that the vast majority of the German people will express opposition to remilitarization and strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany within 1951. Therefore, the Central Committee for the People's Vote directly issued a call to the people: to establish people's vote committees in various places to independently conduct the people's vote. The shameful response of the Adenauer "government" was to ban the people's vote.

　　The coercive measures of the Bonn reactionaries cannot stop the peace fighters in West Germany from fulfilling their great duty to the motherland. Despite Adenauer's ban, the people's vote is still being carried out in West Germany. The results of the vote are published in the newspapers every day, and the results prove the people's resistance to remilitarization.

　　The German Democratic Republic supports the people's movement against remilitarization and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty. It supports this movement with the following work: developing a peaceful economy with great effort in completing the Five-Year Plan; opposing the imperialist war policy and national animosity policy; and calling on all the German people to fight to defend peace.

　　In accordance with the proposal of the Düsseldorf Central Committee, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic decided to hold a people's vote in the German Democratic Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic approved the conduct of the people's vote in the German Democratic Republic because it firmly opposes German remilitarization. She is willing to express once again that the peace-loving people of the German Democratic Republic feel that they are inextricably and fraternally united with the peace forces in West Germany and the German capital.

　　The people's vote against German remilitarization and striving for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany within 1951 will mobilize the German people in the struggle to defend peace. The people's vote is a head-on blow to the war plans of foreign imperialists and German imperialists; it is a contribution to the safety of all peace-loving people."

　　德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团大使衔团长
    柯尼希在京招待记者发表声明
    报告德国人民举行人民投票反对重新军国主义化并要求今年缔结对德和约伟大斗争的意义
    【本报讯】德国人民反对重新武装的斗争，已因德意志民主共和国境内及西德人民所举行的人民投票而进入新的高潮。德意志民主共和国境内的人民投票已于本月五日胜利结束。投票的结果显示：在有效票中，明确表示反对德国重新军国主义化并要求在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的，达百分之九十五点九八，这充分说明了绝大多数的德国人民是坚决反对重新武装的。这对于美国在欧洲武装西德、制造战争的阴谋计划，是一个严重的打击。德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团大使衔团长约翰·柯尼希，于七日在京招待记者，就德国人民这一伟大斗争的重大意义发表声明。
    柯尼希团长首先指出：“德国人民已经觉醒，要明确而坚决地表示反对德国重新军国主义化并争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约。这次人民投票不仅对于德国人民，而且对于所有爱好和平的人民都有很重要的意义。由于这些理由，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克，呼吁全体德国人民，在德国西部以及在德意志民主共和国，通过人民投票，一致并有力地表示为争取和平，争取一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国而斗争的意志。”
    关于美帝国主义分裂德国、武装波恩傀儡军队、恢复西德军火工业的阴谋，柯尼希团长作了以下的分析，他说：美国统治集团，如大家所知道的，企图统治世界并正在准备新的侵略战争。他们对德国的政策是：分裂德国，使德国帝国主义复活，重新武装西德，恢复莱茵和鲁尔区战争经济的潜能并把西德变成他们计划中的侵略战争的进军基地。他们不顾二次世界大战后一切关于处理德国问题的合法的国际协定和条约，特别是波茨坦协定；这个协定的条款是符合各国人民，包括德国人民的意志，并且为爱好和平的苏联所一贯遵守的。
    帝国主义占领国家依靠着充满了复仇欲望的德国垄断资本家，也就是依靠那些曾经使希特勒上台的反动势力，释放德国军火大王兼战犯克虏伯并恢复他的故有权利，这就是他们政策的表现。
    西方占领国家把德国分裂了，并且成立了一个波恩分立国家。波恩“政府”的头子阿登纳是大家所知道的一个报复主义的老牌政客。他和莱茵地区的企业大亨们有着极密切的关系。他是西德和美国垄断资本家阴谋的帮凶，忠实地执行着他们重新军国主义化的命令。西德社会民主党头子舒马赫，为同一的主子效劳。他企图利用一个伪装的反对派的面貌来迷惑群众，使得他们看不清他实际上对重新军国主义化政策的支持。阿登纳和舒马赫的政策是：使西德法西斯化，整顿军备以及准备侵略战争。
    从一九五○年九月美、英、法外长纽约会议以来，武装西德在经济上以及军事上正在公开地加速进行着。在西德已经有用各种各样假名字的德国雇佣兵部队，例如：劳动督察队、防卫队、劳动大队、德国民工组织大队、防卫服务大队、边防大队、工业警察大队、黑卫大队等等。
    警察后备队和边防警察已经建立成完全军事化的部队，领导者都是以前希特勒军队中的将军们，例如步兵将领安东·加色尔以及汉堡的高射炮部队纪赛将军。警察后备队的训练完全按照希特勒国防军的步兵训练方法。正如西德“波胡姆报”在一九五一年四月二十一日所报道，这些部队已经配备有自动手枪，轻机枪，重机枪和装甲车，并且全部机械化了。为了加速建立德国军队，波恩政府在一九五一年四月十七日公布把西德分为十二个军区，五个征兵监督处及二十九个军分区。设立在这些军区和征兵监督处的新兵征募局，已经开始活动了。
    此外，正规化的德国军队（按指西德傀儡军队）之建立，正在准备中。《纽约先驱论坛报》驻波恩记者罗赛尔·希耳，在一九五一年四月十三日证实：“建立一支约有十二个师并配备有六百架飞机作为战术支援的德国作战部队的计划已快完成了”。同时“防御港口用的海军亦已计划就绪。以装甲车和反装甲炮武装的德国部队的计划也在筹备中”。
    一九五○年十二月，西德所有已作为民用的兵营和机场都被征用了。新的机场，兵营以及练兵营正在建筑之中。根据曼茵茨社会民主党报纸《自由报》报道，仅仅在法国占领区内，已经新建了四个机场。同时，在各个战略要点装置了大量的爆炸设备。根据《纽伦堡消息报》一九五一年二月十七日的报道，西德已有六百三十多个桥上修建了炸药洞。
    西德变成了一个战争基地。
    西德的经济在转变成为军备生产。用牺牲民用工业来促进构成战争经济潜能的工业部门中的生产。根据波恩的官方统计，构成军备生产之基础的工业，其生产指数在一九五○年每月的平均产量已经达到一九三六年的百分之一百二十，动力车工业（换句话说，就是装甲车工业）竟达到一九三六年的百分之一百五十。而同时，民用必需品的生产却连战前的水平也没有达到。目前消费品的生产量甚至萎缩了。
    军需物资的生产涉及到西德和西柏林的各种不同的企业。西德大约有三十个工厂正在制造装甲车的零件或装备。约有十七家企业正在生产飞机和装备，约有三十五家企业在制造炮兵武器，子弹和炸药。
    到现在为止，阿登纳“政府”在武装西德方面所采取的最恶劣的、后果最严重的措施，就是参加舒曼计划。舒曼计划规定成立一个煤钢联营，用来统治各个参加国的一切煤矿以及钢铁工业，也就是实现美国在西欧建立兵工厂的计划。它所追随的目的是：加速西德的重新军国主义化，以便在欧洲为侵略性的北大西洋集团建立战争经济的基地。这是美帝国主义者和参加舒曼计划的各帝国主义者，尤其是西德垄断资本家们，为了破坏各国人民的和平和安全而从事的阴谋。
    西德的垄断资本家们，想要保障他们在西欧军备生意上的庞大股份，因此就不惜把德国人民大众的利益践踏在脚下。舒曼计划同时也意味着反动派对西德和西柏林劳动人民加紧肆虐。
    西德劳动人民的生活水平在下降，粮食和日用品的价格却在不断地迅速上涨，两年内面包的价格上涨了百分之五十，牛肉上涨了百分之一百零四，人造牛油上涨了百分之四十五，糖上涨了百分之四十，等等。房费、家用燃煤、交通工具、水、电和煤气都贵了。此外，还有对由于军备扩张而感缺乏的工业日用品的投机倒把抬高物价。到目前为止，一九五一年捐税规定为二百三十四亿东马克，即每人要负担五百马克左右，这已经超过了一九五○年的三分之一。
    同时各大股份公司的利润在上升着。一百三十六个股份公司的资本，从二亿四千六百七十一万增加到三亿一千三百二十二万。由于股票价值增高，西德垄断资本的利润，至少增加了一又四分之三倍。这就是垄断资本家的军火生意。
    在希特勒战争恶果还未消除的经济衰落的情况下，重新武装西德，必然使西德军火制造商及其波恩政府与劳动人民大众之间的对立更加尖锐起来。西德各地的增加工资运动，抗议不合理的工资率的运动以及罢工正在与日俱增。工人、职员和农民抗议物价上涨和捐税不断地增高。”
    柯尼希团长最后指出：“全体德国人民的绝大多数都拒绝美国的战争计划。反对重新军国主义化的人民运动日益广泛地扩及德国人民的各个阶层。
    今年一月在鲁尔区的中心埃森城内召开了一个来自德国人民各阶层的一千七百位代表的，意义重大的，反对重新军国主义化的大会。在莱茵——魏斯伐利亚的杜塞尔多夫城中成立了人民投票中央委员会。它按照埃森和平代表大会的决议，要求举行关于反对重新军国主义化并争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票。实行重新军国主义化的波恩内阁，拒绝了杜塞尔多夫中央委员会关于实行人民投票的建议，因为它知道，德国人民的绝大多数将表示反对重新军国主义化并争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约。于是，人民投票中央委员会就直接向人民发出了号召：在各地成立人民投票委员会，独立地进行人民投票。阿登纳“政府”的可耻回答就是禁止人民投票。
    波恩反动派的强迫措施，不能阻止西德的和平战士们履行他们对祖国的伟大天职。虽然有阿登纳的禁令，人民投票在西德却仍然进行着。每天报纸上登载着投票的结果，这个结果证明了人民对重新军国主义化的抗拒。
    德意志民主共和国支持着反对重新军国主义化和争取缔结和约的人民运动。她以下列的工作来支持这种运动：在完成五年计划的工作中以极大的努力来发展和平经济；反对帝国主义的战争政策及民族仇视政策；号召全德国人民为保卫和平而斗争。
    按照杜塞尔多夫中央委员会的建议，德意志民主共和国人民议会决定在德意志民主共和国国内也举行人民投票。德意志民主共和国政府赞成在德意志民主共和国国内进行人民投票，因为她坚决反对德国重新军国主义化。她愿意再一次表示，德意志民主共和国爱好和平的人民感觉到他们自己与西德以及德国首都的和平力量是不可分离地，兄弟般地团结在一起的。
    反对德国重新军国主义化并争取在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票，将会把德国人民在保卫和平的斗争中动员起来。人民投票对外国帝国主义者和德国帝国主义者的战争计划是一当头棒喝；它对所有爱好和平人民的安全是一个贡献。”
