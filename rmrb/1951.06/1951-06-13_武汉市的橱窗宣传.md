　　Window Displays in Wuhan
　　Lin Gang

　　In Wuhan, shop assistants, in conjunction with work competitions, have "armed" most of the city's shop windows in the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda campaign. Now, as workers go to work, students carry their schoolbags to school, Liberation Army soldiers march through the streets, cadres go from their dormitories to their workplaces, and housewives go to the market or department stores to buy daily necessities, they all have the opportunity to be educated by the "propaganda windows." Liangdao Street in Wuchang is a remote alley, but the windows of the sauce gardens, rice shops, and cigarette and paper sundries shops there are all engaged in propaganda. Hankou's Jianghan Road is the most outstanding street, with almost every window serving the anti-American and aid-Korea campaign. After dinner, when the river breeze blows into the streets, people take walks, and the propaganda windows unfold their propaganda and mobilization. Among the myriad lights, each window is surrounded by people. According to estimates from many shops, each window attracts about two hundred viewers per day, adding up to a very large number for the entire city.

　　Introducing Several Propaganda Windows

　　The window displays of the Central Branch of the Department Store and the Zheng Dayou Pharmacy in Wuchang were among the earliest and best, and they have maintained their original achievements. The former has added a "Soviet Window" (organized by the branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the store), which is very popular with cadres and citizens from all walks of life. The Xinhua Bookstore on Jianghan Road uses large photos for current affairs propaganda. Laocheng Cloth Store has set up a window display that is of great interest and educational significance to children – "Road Game" – all the crossroads have peace-loving people demonstrating, and American warmongers cannot pass anywhere.

　　Listening to Public Opinion and Improving Work

　　Wuhan newspapers have praised the shop assistants in the silk and cloth industry, whose propaganda windows are the best. They often listen to public opinion and improve their work. Now, they have not only "armed" the windows but also "armed" all the walls inside the counters that can be used. The Yongkang Cloth Store in Wuchang initially only cut out words to paste slogans on the glass. The second time, they bought ready-made propaganda posters. By the "May Day" holiday, they hung a huge oil painting and chose a very important theme that no other store had promoted: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the new China is carrying out great construction, and the national defense strength of the motherland is unprecedentedly strong. The picture is easy to understand. The shop assistants said: "Most of the people who come to our store to buy goods are housewives. If they don't understand, our efforts will be in vain."

　　The methods of window display propaganda can be diverse, but according to the reaction of many people, comic strips are the most popular. Now, many windows are decorated with comic strips.

　　Collaboration Between Artists and Shop Assistants

　　The Yuexin Chang Silk and Cloth Store has arranged a set of comic strips describing the crimes of the special agent Hu Qingshan. Hu Qingshan was a wharf bully and special agent familiar and hated by the people of Hankou, and has now been executed. The color and composition of this set of comic strips have a new style and are warmly welcomed by the masses. This set of paintings was painted by the Wuhan Municipal Cultural Troupe. The Central South Cultural Troupe, the Art Department of Zhongyuan University, and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education all have works on display in shop windows. In addition, some stage scenery designers, school art teachers, and students who love painting are helping shops make propaganda posters. The cooperation between artists and shop assistants has given the window display propaganda movement a new look.

　　Organization and Leadership

　　Window display propaganda has become a movement in Wuhan. This movement is organized and led. More than two months ago, there was not a single shop in the city with window displays. In late March, the newspapers introduced the window display propaganda movement in Shanghai and Beijing, and three or five shops took the lead. In early April, the Changjiang Daily introduced the experience of the Central Branch of the Department Store, which had the best window displays at the time, and wrote a short commentary calling on the relevant departments to organize and lead the window display propaganda into a movement; and hoping that artists and shop assistants would cooperate. Subsequently, the shop assistants' union and the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly carried out mobilization and organization work, and the "propaganda windows" gradually increased. In mid-April, the Central South Workers' Daily held a "Symposium on Advanced Experience in Window Display Propaganda," which greatly promoted window display propaganda. By the eve of the "May Day" holiday, a large number of "propaganda windows" emerged, and the first batch of "propaganda windows" with cooperation between artists and shop assistants also appeared.

　　Shortcomings and Improvement Methods

　　At present, the content of Wuhan's window display propaganda is mostly correct. However, several propaganda windows with inappropriate content have also been found. For example, Liu Youyutang in Wuchang has a propaganda poster showing Truman raising his hands in "surrender" under the attack of the Asian people. Depicting American imperialism as an enemy that cannot withstand a single blow is not in line with the actual situation and is harmful. We should publicize that the Asian people have the confidence and strength to defeat the aggression of American imperialism, but this requires great effort and sacrifice. Underestimating the strength and conspiracy of the enemy will lead to thoughts of underestimation and paralysis.

　　There was once a cloth shop that used a three-dimensional model to depict "workers catching special agents," but the model uglified the image of the workers. After accepting public opinion, the cloth shop removed the model. However, there are still some pictures and models that uglify the working people, which must be corrected. In addition, some propaganda posters have vague themes and sloppy pictures, which others cannot understand, thus losing their propaganda significance.

　　Window display propaganda posters are almost all imitations of comics that have already been published in newspapers and magazines by shop assistants. However, not all comics published in newspapers and magazines are without errors, so attention should be paid to selection. Many shop assistants have begun to use the method of collective selection and review of drafts and collective creation and arrangement, and pay attention to constantly listening to public opinion to keep the content of window display propaganda correct.

　　Moving Towards Regularization

　　Now, the propaganda and education work of resisting America and aiding Korea has become regularized. The ranks of Wuhan's propaganda windows are also continuing to work hard. Many propaganda windows are preparing to change their displays every half month. In this regard, the shop's capitalists have given a lot of help. They not only provide paper and paint, but also give the shop assistants responsible for arranging the windows appropriate time.

### 武汉市的橱窗宣传

　　武汉市的橱窗宣传
    林钢
    武汉市的店员们在抗美援朝宣传中，结合工作竞赛，把全市大部分商店的橱窗都“武装”起来了。现在，工人上工，学生背起书包上学，解放军列队走过街市，干部从宿舍到工作地点，家庭主妇上菜市场或者到百货公司添制日用品时，都有了机会受到“宣传橱窗”的教育。武昌粮道街是条僻巷，那里的酱园、米店和烟纸杂货铺的橱窗，都在向人宣传。汉口江汉路是最出色的一条街，几乎每个橱窗都为抗美援朝服务了。晚饭过后，江风吹进街市，是人们散步的时候，也是宣传橱窗展开它的宣传鼓动的时候。万家灯火中，每个橱窗面前围满了人。据许多商店的材料估计，每天每处观众约为二百人，全市加起来是一个很大的数目。
            介绍几个宣传橱窗
    百货公司中心门市部和武昌郑大有药房的橱窗宣传，是做得最早最好的两个，它们一直保持着原有的成绩。前者新添设了一个“苏联之窗”（由该店中苏友好协会支会举办），深得干部和各界市民欢迎。江汉路新华书店用大张照片进行时事宣传。老成布店布置了一个孩子们最感兴趣而有教育意义的橱窗——“行路游戏”——所有十字路口，都有和平人民在示威游行，美国战争贩子处处不能通行。
            听取群众意见，改进工作
    武汉的报纸曾经表扬过绸缎布匹业的店员，他们的宣传橱窗是成绩最好的。他们经常听取群众意见，改进工作。现在他们不仅“武装”了橱窗，而且“武装”了柜内凡是可以利用的墙壁。武昌永康布店，第一次只剪字在玻璃上贴口号，第二次买现成的宣传画，到“五一”节时他们挂出了巨幅油画，而且选择了别的商店都没有宣传过而非常重要的主题——在毛主席领导下，新中国正在进行伟大的建设，祖国国防力量已经空前强大。画面通俗易懂。店员们说：“到我们店里买货的，家庭妇女最多，假如她们不懂，我们的努力就白费了。”
    橱窗宣传的方式可以是多种多样的，但根据许多群众的反应，连环画最受欢迎。现在，许多橱窗都布置了连环画。
            美术工作者和店员合作
    悦新昌绸缎布店布置了一套描述特务胡青山罪行的连环画。胡青山是汉口人民熟悉而痛恨的码头恶霸兼特务，现已伏法。这套连环画的色泽和构图，具有新的风格，受到群众的热烈欢迎。这套画是武汉市文工团画的。中南文工团，中原大学美术系、市文教局等，都有作品在商店橱窗展出。另外，某些舞台的布景师、学校的美术教员和爱好绘画的学生，都在帮助商店制作宣传画。美术工作者和店员合作，使橱窗宣传运动开始出现新的面貌。
            组织与领导
    橱窗宣传在武汉已经成为运动了，这一运动是有组织和有领导的。两个多月前，全市还没有出现一个有橱窗宣传的商店。三月下旬，报纸介绍了上海和北京的橱窗宣传运动，当时便有三、五家商店首先搞起来了。四月初，长江日报介绍了当时橱窗宣传搞得最出色的百货公司中心门市部的经验，写了短评，号召有关方面加以组织领导，把橱窗宣传搞成运动；并且希望美术工作者和店员合作。其后，店员工会和工商联合会共同进行了动员和组织工作，“宣传橱窗”便陆续增加了。四月中旬，中南工人报召开了“橱窗宣传先进经验座谈会”，这一会议对橱窗宣传起了很大的推动作用。到“五一”节前夕，大量的“宣传橱窗”涌现出来了，也出现了第一批美术工作者和店员合作的“宣传橱窗”。
            缺点与改进方法
    目前，武汉市橱窗宣传的内容，绝大多数是正确的。但是也已发现了几个内容并不妥当的宣传橱窗。比方，武昌刘有余堂有张宣传画，画面显示，在亚洲人民打击下，杜鲁门举手“投降”了。把美帝国主义描绘成不堪一击的敌人，这是不符合实际情况的，并且是有害的。我们应当宣传亚洲人民有信心和力量打败美帝国主义的侵略，但这需要极大的努力并付出代价。对于敌人的力量和阴谋估计不足，是会造成轻敌麻痹的思想的。
    曾经有一个布店，用立体模型描写“工人捉特务”，但这个模型把工人的形象丑化了。这个布店在接受群众意见后，已经撤去模型。但目前仍有一些把劳动人民丑化的图画和模型，这是必须改正的。此外有些宣传画主题模糊，画面潦草，别人看不懂，因此失去了宣传意义。
    橱窗宣传画，差不多都是店员依照报纸杂志已经登载的漫画仿制的。但并非报纸杂志登载的漫画都没有错误，因此应注意选择。许多店员已开始用集体选稿审稿和集体创作布置的办法，并且注意经常倾听群众意见，使橱窗宣传内容保持正确。
            走向经常化
    现在，抗美援朝的宣传教育工作已走向经常化。武汉市宣传橱窗的队伍，也在继续努力。许多宣传橱窗准备半月换一次装置。在这方面，商店的资方曾给了许多帮助，他们不仅出纸出颜料，而且，还给了负责布置橱窗的店员以适当的时间。
