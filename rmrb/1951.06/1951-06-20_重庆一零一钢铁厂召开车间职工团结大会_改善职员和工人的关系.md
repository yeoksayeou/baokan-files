　　Chongqing 101 Steel Plant
　  Convenes Workers' Solidarity Meeting
　  Improve Relations Between Staff and Workers
    Following the initial phase of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the Chongqing 101 Steel Plant, through the use of criticism and self-criticism, eliminated the estrangement between staff and workers, further strengthening worker solidarity.
    Before liberation, a small number of supervisory staff members at the 101 Steel Plant had poor work styles, frequently abusing and scolding workers, placing them in an antagonistic position with the worker masses. After liberation, the plant administration and the trade union conducted education on worker solidarity through various campaigns, initially improving worker relations, but the estrangement was not completely eliminated. In March and April of this year, after the initial phase of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, many workers urgently requested that staff members who had abused and oppressed workers in the past conduct self-criticisms and correct their work styles. At the time, these staff members also had ideological concerns. They feared retaliation from workers and the settling of old scores, and were therefore uneasy and dared not boldly take responsibility for management work. In light of this situation, the plant's trade union and administration convened worker solidarity meetings in the workshops, launching criticism and self-criticism to improve worker relations. Before convening the solidarity meetings, the plant's trade union and administration repeatedly educated workers and staff, explaining that staff members who had oppressed workers in the past must conduct deep self-criticism, admit their mistakes, and that the purpose was not to settle old scores, but to raise awareness, correct work styles, eliminate estrangement, and unite for production. It was also explained that there should be a principled distinction between staff members with poor work styles and counter-revolutionaries, and that the two should not be confused. Therefore, the solidarity meetings in each workshop were very smooth. For example, when the machine shop convened a solidarity meeting, Wang Linyuan, director of the manufacturing department, boldly criticized at the meeting his past mistakes of consistently abusing and scolding workers before liberation, and using workers for personal work at will. After his self-criticism, he said: "During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, I was afraid that the workers would not trust me, and I felt very distressed. I never thought that everyone would be so forgiving today, which makes me feel that I still have a great future." Tan Huixiang, head of the steel bar shop, also abused and scolded workers before liberation, arbitrarily fined workers, and fired workers. After liberation, he was not active and responsible in his work. This February, when the rolling mill broke and the motor burned out, he did nothing about it. At the solidarity meeting in the workshop, he also made a deep self-criticism. At the same time, the workers also made appropriate criticisms of these staff members' mistakes. After these staff members admitted their past mistakes and expressed their willingness to correct them, the workers asked them to boldly take responsibility for management work as usual.
    After the solidarity meetings, the enthusiasm of many staff members has begun to be brought into play. Wang Linyuan is now actively participating in the renovation of the 8,000-horsepower machine. Tan Huixiang has begun to attach importance to the workers' rationalization proposals, and can complete the review within five days of each proposal being submitted. On the basis of improved worker relations, the specialist responsibility system for each group in the steelmaking shop has begun to be established. In the past, shift handover took more than half an hour, but now it only takes ten minutes.

### 重庆一零一钢铁厂召开车间职工团结大会  改善职员和工人的关系

　　重庆一零一钢铁厂
　  召开车间职工团结大会
　  改善职员和工人的关系
    重庆一零一钢铁厂在镇压反革命运动初步结束后，又用开展批评和自我批评的方法，消除了职员和工人之间的隔阂，进一步加强了职工团结。
    一零一钢铁厂在解放前，少数主管职员作风不好，经常打骂工人，与工人群众处于对立地位。解放后，该厂行政和工会曾通过各种运动进行职工团结的教育，初步改善了职工关系，但彼此隔阂仍未完全消除。今年三、四月份该厂镇压反革命运动初步结束后，许多工人迫切要求过去打骂、压迫工人的职员能进行检讨，改正作风。当时，这些职员思想上也有顾虑。他们怕工人报复，算旧账，因而惶惑不安，不敢大胆负责管理工作。根据这种情况，该厂工会及行政即召开车间职工团结大会，开展批评与自我批评来改善职工关系。在召开团结大会之前，该厂工会及行政曾对工人、职员反复进行教育，说明过去压迫工人的职员必须深刻检讨，承认错误，其目的不是要算旧账，而是要提高认识，改正作风，消除隔阂，团结生产。同时也向大家说明对于作风不好的职员和反革命分子应有原则的区别，绝不能混淆。因此，各车间的团结大会就开得十分顺利。例如机工场召开团结大会时，制造部主任王遴元就大胆地在会上检讨了他解放前一贯打骂工人、随便使用工人给他个人干活的错误。他在检讨后说：“在镇压反革命运动中，我怕工人不相信我，心中很苦闷，想不到今天大家对我这样宽恕，使我感到还有很大前途。”钢条场场长谭辉祥解放前也打骂工人，动辄罚工，开除工人，解放后工作不积极负责，今年二月份轧辊断了，马达烧了，他都不管。在该车间团结大会上，他也作了深刻检讨。同时，工人们对于这些职员的错误也进行了适当的批评。当这些职员承认了过去的错误并表示愿意改正后，工人们也就提出要他们大胆地照常负责管理工作。
    团结大会后，许多职员的积极性已开始发挥起来。王遴元现正积极参加八千匹马力机的装修工作。谭辉祥已开始重视工人群众的合理化建议，每当建议提出后五天内就能审核完毕。在职工关系改善了的基础上，炼工场各小组的专责制已开始建立起来。过去交接班需要半个钟头以上，现在只十分钟就行了。
