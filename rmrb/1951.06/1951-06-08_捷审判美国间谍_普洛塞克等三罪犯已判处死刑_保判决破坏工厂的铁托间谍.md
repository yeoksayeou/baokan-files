　　Xinhua News Agency, June 7th, dispatch from Prague: The Czechoslovak State Court publicly tried seven American spies in Prague from May 30th to June 1st. The trial confirmed that American imperialists were using trade activities as a smokescreen to conduct large-scale espionage and sabotage activities. The defendant Prosek, manager of Dom Standard Electric Company (Czechoslovak branch of American International Standard Electric Company), had been working as a spy for the United States since 1945, and for several years had been sabotaging Czechoslovakia's electrical industry and telegraph and telephone network. The defendant Pulsibik, an employee of Standard Electric Company, established a network for espionage and sabotage activities and obstructed Czechoslovakia's efforts to nationalize Dom Standard Electric Company, enabling the United States to use the company for espionage activities. The defendant Kopel, an employee of Prague Signal Technology Company, caused Czechoslovakia to suffer losses of millions of Czech crowns through his sabotage activities. The court has sentenced Prosek and two other extremely heinous criminals to death, and sentenced Pulsibik and four other criminals to prison terms of varying lengths.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, June 6th, dispatch from Sofia: The Sofia Court in Bulgaria publicly tried three Titoist spies who sabotaged factories—Milanov, Manchev, and Todorov—on the 2nd and 3rd. They set fire to and blew up the "Kyo Milev" state-owned factory near Sofia, and eleven workers died in the explosion.
    The trial has confirmed that the principal culprit, Milanov, joined the Yugoslav spy agency as early as 1944 and engaged in espionage activities under the direction of the Yugoslav Embassy in Bulgaria. Yugoslav embassy official Ugliza told Milanov when instructing him to blow up the "Kyo Milev" factory that capitalist countries would regard the explosion of the "Kyo Milev" factory as an expression of Bulgarian workers' dissatisfaction with the current government, which could be used as propaganda against the people's democratic countries. The criminals confessed to their crimes of engaging in espionage and subversive activities. Milanov and Manchev confessed that they had collected information about Bulgarian state secrets for Yugoslavia.
    The court has sentenced the principal culprit, Milanov, to death and confiscated all his property; Manchev was sentenced to ten years in prison, and Todorov to five years in prison.

    保判决破坏工厂的铁托间谍
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克国家法庭于五月三十日到六月一日在布拉格公开审讯了七名美国间谍。审讯证实美帝国主义者以贸易活动为烟幕，进行大规模的间谍和破坏活动。被告普洛塞克是多姆士标准电气公司（美国国际标准电气公司捷克斯洛伐克分公司）的经理，一九四五年就给美国作间谍，几年来一直在破坏捷克斯洛伐克的电气工业和电报电话网。被告普尔西比克是标准电气公司职员，他曾建立间谍与破坏活动网，并多方阻挠捷克斯洛伐克把多姆士标准电气公司收归国有，使美国能够利用该公司进行间谍活动。被告科普尔是布拉格信号技术公司的职员，他的破坏活动使捷克遭受了捷币数百万克朗的损失。法庭已将普洛塞克等三名罪大恶极的罪犯判处死刑，并判处普尔西比克等四犯刑期不等的徒刑。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚索非亚法庭于二日及三日公开审讯三个破坏工厂的铁托间谍——米拉诺夫、曼契夫和托多罗夫。他们曾纵火焚烧和爆炸索非亚附近的“基奥·米列夫”国营工厂，有十一个工人在爆炸中死亡。
    审讯已经证实：主犯米拉诺夫早在一九四四年就加入南斯拉夫间谍机关，在南斯拉夫驻保加利亚大使馆指挥下从事间谍活动。南斯拉夫使馆官员乌格利加在指使米拉诺夫爆炸“基奥·米列夫”工厂时对他说：资本主义国家将认为爆炸“基奥·米列夫”工厂是保加利亚工人不满现政府的表示，可利用来作为反对人民民主国家的宣传。罪犯们都供出了他们从事间谍和颠覆活动的罪行，米拉诺夫和曼契夫供认他们曾替南斯拉夫搜集关于保加利亚国家机密的情报。
    法庭已判处主犯米拉诺夫死刑，全部财产没收；曼契夫处十年有期徒刑，托多罗夫处五年有期徒刑。
