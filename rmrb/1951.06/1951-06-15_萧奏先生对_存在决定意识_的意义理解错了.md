　　Mr. Xiao Zou Misunderstands the Meaning of "Existence Determines Consciousness"
            (I) To the Editor:
    Mr. Xiao Zou uses the proposition "existence determines consciousness" to defend "Wu Xun" and the "Wu Xun spirit." However, Mr. Xiao Zou has misapplied this proposition. We know that to criticize a person's "entire personality, thought, behavior, meaning, and value," we should understand the historical conditions of his time and then see what role his thoughts and behaviors played in the development of society under those specific historical conditions. But Mr. Xiao Zou only mentions clarifying the "historical conditions" and forgets the latter point.
    Mr. Xiao Zou uses reasons such as "this Don Quixote-like act of going it alone (referring to begging and performing feats) was very natural in a dispersed and backward small-peasant economy" and "Wu Xun's era was an era of 'scholar-officials and famous scholars' and 'the Three Cardinal Guides and the Five Constant Virtues,' 'egotism.' Without these two 'treasures,' schools simply could not be successfully established. This was determined by historical conditions" to explain the "historical conditions" of Wu Xun's thoughts and behaviors and "Wu Xun's failure was an inevitable ending." Unfortunately, Mr. Xiao Zou does not evaluate Wu Xun's shameful behavior and its effects from a revolutionary perspective. Instead, he affirms Wu Xun's "value," which is a huge mistake. Any regressive and decadent figure has his "historical conditions." Landlord tyrants are products of feudal society, and their exploitation and oppression of peasants are also determined by "historical conditions." Then, are we not supposed to carry out land reform? Chiang Kai-shek, this public enemy of the people who colluded with imperialism and sold out the motherland, is a product of semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Should we tolerate his treasonous crimes?
    Mr. Xiao Zou's one-sided and erroneous understanding of the meaning of "historical conditions" is extremely harmful. This erroneous viewpoint should be opposed.

        (II) To the Editor:
    Mr. Xiao Zou uses "existence determines consciousness" to defend Wu Xun. Mr. Xiao Zou believes that the era in which Wu Xun lived inevitably led him to serve the feudal ruling class by spreading feudal ideology through charity schools.
    Clearly, Mr. Xiao Zou's understanding of "existence determines consciousness" is mechanical and one-sided.
    In feudal society, there was the ideological consciousness of the landlord class, which supported exploitation and wanted peasants to willingly be slaves. At the same time, there was also the ideological consciousness of the peasant class, which resisted landlord exploitation. These two different ideological consciousnesses, and the different actions controlled by these two different ideological consciousnesses, are the measures for evaluating historical figures. Mr. Xiao Zou mistakenly understands the meaning of clarifying "historical conditions" and grasps the backward ideological consciousness of the time to defend Wu Xun, while misunderstanding the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, a massive peasant revolution that shook feudal rule.
    Mr. Xiao Zou's so-called "clarifying historical conditions" is looking at the problem from the regressive and backward side of history. He isolates "existence determines consciousness" to defend Wu Xun, while ignoring the influence of ideological consciousness on society. This is not a historical materialist viewpoint, but a mechanical materialist viewpoint.

### 萧奏先生对“存在决定意识”的意义理解错了

　　萧奏先生对“存在决定意识”的意义理解错了
            （一）编辑同志：
    萧奏先生以“存在决定意识”的命题，为“武训”及“武训精神”辩护。但是，萧奏先生把这个命题运用错了。我们知道，要批判一个人的“全部人格思想、行为的意义和价值”，应该搞清楚他当时的历史条件，然后看他的思想行为，在这个具体的历史条件下，对社会发展起了什么作用。但萧奏先生则仅仅提出了搞清楚“历史条件”这一点，而忘掉了后者。
    萧奏先生用“这种单枪匹马的唐·吉诃德式的举动（按：指讨饭和卖把式），在一种分散的、落后的小农经济的社会里，是十分自然的”及“武训的时代是‘进士老爷名流学者’和‘三纲五常’‘唯我独尊’的时代，没有这两样‘宝贝’，学校就根本办不成功。这是历史条件所决定的。”等理由来说明武训思想行为的“历史条件”及“武训的失败是必然的结局”。可惜的是，萧奏先生并没有以革命的观点来评价武训的可耻的行为及其效果，相反地倒肯定武训的“价值”，这实在是一个绝大的错误。任何倒退的腐朽的人物，都是有他的“历史条件”的。地主恶霸是封建社会的产物，他们剥削、压迫农民，也是“历史条件”所决定的。那末，我们是不是能够不进行土地改革呢？蒋介石这个勾结帝国主义，出卖祖国的人民公敌是半封建半殖民地的产物，我们难道应该容忍他的卖国罪行吗？
    萧奏先生片面地、错误地理解“历史条件”的意义，是极为有害的。应该反对这种错误的观点。
                                  王干桢
        （二）编辑同志：
    萧奏先生以“存在决定意识”来为武训辩护。萧奏先生认为：武训所处的时代，就必然使武训把传播封建思想的义学来为当时的封建统治阶级服务。
    很显然，萧奏先生对“存在决定意识”的了解是机械的、片面的。
    在封建社会中，有地主阶级的拥护剥削、要农民甘心做奴才的思想意识，同时也有着农民阶级的反抗地主剥削的思想意识。这两种不同的思想意识，以及在这两种不同的思想意识下所支配的不同行动，是评价历史人物的尺度。萧奏先生错误地理解了搞清“历史条件”的意义，抓住了当时社会中落后的思想意识来为武训辩护，而对轰轰烈烈震动封建统治的农民大革命——太平天国运动不理解。
    萧奏先生所谓“搞清历史条件”，是站在历史倒退、落后的那一方面看问题的。他孤立地以“存在决定意识”来为武训辩护，而忽视了思想意识对社会的影响。这不是历史唯物论的观点，而是机械唯物论的观点。
