To all student and youth league member comrades:

    In order to further strengthen the national defense construction of the motherland, to smash the imperialists' conspiracies to invade our country, and to defend world peace, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has decided to enroll students in various military cadre schools nationwide once again. This decision fully meets the needs of the people's motherland and also fully meets the requirements of revolutionary educated youth to actively participate in national defense construction. The Central Committee of the Youth League warmly supports this decision and calls on all revolutionary educated youth and youth league members throughout the country to enthusiastically respond to the solemn call of the motherland and actively step onto the glorious posts of patriotic youth.

    The Chinese people's revolution has achieved a great victory. The anti-US aggression and aid Korea action has fully demonstrated the invincible power of the Chinese people. However, "the imperialists and domestic reactionaries are never reconciled to their defeat; they will still make their final struggle"—Chairman Mao once instructed us—"We must not relax our vigilance." Therefore, when the motherland called on our youth to join military cadre schools and strengthen the modernization of national defense last December, our vast number of patriotic youth across the country responded enthusiastically to the call of the motherland with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm. The youth of New China all regard "being ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time" as their sacred duty. For the prosperity and strength of our great motherland, our brothers and sisters have demonstrated their infinite love and loyalty to the motherland in various positions. The Central Committee of the Youth League firmly believes that the revolutionary educated youth of the Mao Zedong era will certainly be able to bravely and enthusiastically participate in this glorious cause of strengthening national defense construction. In particular, youth league members who meet the enrollment conditions should take practical actions to practice the provisions of the League Program: "To do everything possible to strengthen the people's armed forces."

    Because the task of building the motherland is extremely grand, it includes military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, so the basic spirit of this decision by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government takes into account both the needs of the motherland today and the needs of the motherland tomorrow. The Central Committee of the Youth League believes that all youth who meet the registration conditions in the decision of the Government Administration Council should realistically and conscientiously consider the needs of the motherland, and decide what actions should be taken at present according to their specific circumstances. Youth League members should use their exemplary actions and methods of persuasion and education to lead the broad masses of revolutionary educated youth to actively respond to this call of the People's Government on the principle of conscious voluntarism, assist the People's Government to complete the task quickly and smoothly, and enable themselves and the broad masses of youth to improve their political awareness at the same time. For the students who participate in the military cadre schools, we should express our respect for their will to actively participate in national defense construction and resolutely defend the motherland; for the students who remain in school to continue their studies, we should encourage and lead them to study harder, exercise, actively participate in the anti-US aggression and aid Korea movement, and be ready to serve the motherland at any time.

    Youth League members and student comrades! The people entrust us with a glorious mission, and the motherland places the greatest trust in us. Let us use practical actions to give the motherland a resounding answer once again!

　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    为响应政务院关于各种军事干部学校
    招收学生的决定告全国学生及青年团员书全国学生和青年团员同志们：
    为了进一步加强祖国的国防建设，粉碎帝国主义者侵略祖国的阴谋，保卫世界和平，中央人民政府政务院决定各种军事干部学校在全国范围再招收一次学生。这一决定，完全符合于人民祖国的需要，也完全符合于革命知识青年积极参加国防建设事业的要求。青年团中央热烈拥护这个决定，并号召全国革命知识青年和青年团员热烈响应祖国庄严的号召，踊跃走上爱国青年的光荣岗位。
    中国人民革命取得了伟大胜利，在抗美援朝行动中充分显示了中国人民不可战胜的力量，但是，“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎”，——毛主席曾经指示我们——“我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”。所以去年十二月祖国号召我们青年参加军事干部学校，加强现代化国防建设的时候，我们全国广大的爱国青年，怀着高度的爱国热情，热烈地响应了祖国的号召。新中国的青年，人人都把“时刻准备着响应祖国的号召”，作为自己神圣的职责。为了我们伟大祖国的繁荣和富强，我们的兄弟姊妹们，已在各个岗位上表现了他们对于祖国的无限热爱和忠诚。青年团中央深信：毛泽东时代的革命知识青年，一定能够勇敢地热烈地参加这一次加强国防建设的光荣事业。特别是适合于招生条件的青年团员们，当更能以实际的行动，来实践团纲的规定：“全力巩固人民的武装力量”。
    由于建设祖国的任务是极其宏大的，它包含着军事、政治、经济、文化各方面的工作，所以中央人民政府政务院这次决定的基本精神，既照顾到祖国今天的需要，同时又照顾到祖国明天的需要。青年团中央认为：凡是合于政务院决定中报名条件的青年，都应该实事求是地认真考虑祖国的需要，根据自己的具体情况，决定当前应该采取的行动。青年团员，要用自己的模范行动和说服教育的方法，带动广大革命知识青年，在自觉自愿原则下，积极响应人民政府这个号召，协助人民政府迅速地顺利地完成任务，并使自己和广大青年在政治觉悟方面同时能有所提高。对于参加军事干部学校的同学们，则应对他们积极参加国防建设和坚决捍卫祖国的意志表示敬意；对于留在学校继续学习的同学们，则应鼓舞和带动他们更加努力学习，锻炼身体，积极参加抗美援朝运动，随时准备为祖国服务。
    青年团员和学生同志们！人民把光荣的使命付托给我们，祖国把最大的信任寄托给我们，让我们用实际行动再一次给祖国响亮的回答吧！
              中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
            一九五一年六月二十五日
