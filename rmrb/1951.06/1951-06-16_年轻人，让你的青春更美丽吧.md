　　Young People, Make Your Youth More Beautiful
　　Wei Wei
    Youth is beautiful. But one's youth can be ordinary and unremarkable; it can also radiate the heroic light of fire. It can be filled with regret for wasted time; or it can take solid steps towards a magnificent and splendid adulthood.

    Young friends, here, I want to report to you how the educated youth under the guidance of Mao Zedong are spending their youth on the Korean battlefield.

    Youth League member Dai Dubo, 24 years old, was a middle school student from Hunan. He is a cultural instructor in a certain company of the Volunteer Army. The first battle he encountered was the Battle of Flying Tiger Mountain. He led a stretcher team to rescue the wounded. When the troops charged up the high and steep mountain and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy, he was still squatting at the foot of the mountain. At this time, like most people who were new to the battlefield, he felt that every shell and every bullet from the enemy was aimed specifically at him. But he thought, "Can I be so afraid of war! Why am I always squatting here? Didn't I write in my letter of determination that I would welcome the tempering and testing of me?" Thinking this, he stood up and climbed up the mountain. He had just entered a small grove when suddenly a shell landed right on a tree, blowing it apart. He quickly squatted down again. At this moment, in the red light of the flashing artillery fire, he saw a soldier rolling down the mountain. He didn't know if he had been hit by a bullet or tripped over a stone. But immediately afterwards, the soldier climbed up the slope again, holding a grenade high, shouting something, and charged up again. The young Dai Dubo thought to himself, "Can't I move forward?" He stood up again, trying to straighten his back, and climbed up with the stretcher team. At this time, the position had already been captured by us. When the company commander saw Dai Dubo coming, he anxiously asked, "How is it, Dai Dubo? This is your first time, like a bride in a sedan chair!" Dai Dubo smiled and prepared to carry a wounded soldier from the position. However, the mountain was steep and the road was narrow, making it impossible to carry him. Dai Dubo said, "Then, let me carry him." The company commander refused, wanting someone else to carry him. Dai Dubo blushed with anxiety and said, "Company commander, my letter of determination wasn't written in vain!" As he spoke, he picked up the wounded soldier. However, he had not walked far on the steep slope before he was covered in sweat and stumbling, unable to move. He struggled to take a few more steps, feeling flustered, thirsty, dizzy, and his legs were sore and weak. Every step felt like he was carrying a thousand pounds. He thought, "How can a person be so heavy, I should rest for a while." At that moment, he didn't know how he bumped the wounded soldier, and he heard an "ouch" from his back. This made him feel even worse than if he had received the most severe scolding. He just grabbed a small tree to steady himself, then faced backward, grabbing the steep slope with his hands, and gritted his teeth as he carried him down. ... He finally carried the wounded soldier to the dressing station.

    When Dai Dubo rushed to the position for the second time, he was no longer afraid. Moreover, he filled the soldiers' canteens with water, carrying a whole bunch of them jingling on his back. The soldiers were so happy to receive the canteens that they almost jumped up, grabbing his hands, laughing, and shouting. ... The enemy began to charge, and everyone advised Dai Dubo to go down. But he said, "No! I must throw a grenade!" The enemy charged to the front, and finally Dai Dubo, together with the soldiers, threw a grenade for the first time in his life. This was no ordinary grenade, it was a glorious grenade, it was the determination of Chinese educated youth to temper themselves! This grenade exploded in the face of the dark forces of the world; and the young Dai Dubo personally heard the sound of this grenade exploding.

    At the request of the soldiers, he was credited with a meritorious service. On the day of the celebration, he once said to people:

    "This is the happiest day of my life, Dai Dubo!"

    Young friends! Have you ever experienced this kind of happiness? Are you willing to have this kind of happy and glorious youth?

    Here, I would also like to talk about the situation of those young women. Before going abroad, in order to participate in the solemn and great struggle in Korea, they repeatedly requested with letters of determination. When they were not allowed, they stayed in the leaders' houses and refused to leave. When they were still not agreed to in the end, they cried. ... Their cries were so sincere that they had to be allowed. They went abroad with smiles, wiping away their young tears.

    From the day they crossed the Yalu River, they carried so many things on their backs! Carrying backpacks, ten pounds of dried food, ten pounds of rice, a small shovel, and some even had a violin. One night, they marched ninety li. Some male comrades even fell behind, but they gritted their teeth, with feet full of blisters, and did not fall behind at all. When crossing icy rivers, they rolled up their trouser legs and waded through the rushing water like the male comrades. When ice cut their legs, they secretly bandaged them without saying a word. When camping, they used pine branches to prop up a small tarpaulin on the hillside, squeezed together, and when they woke up cold at night, they jumped around a bit before going back to sleep. The next morning, their hair was covered with frost. The male comrades laughed at them, saying, "Hey, you don't even need makeup to play the 'White-Haired Girl'!" They also laughed at the male comrades, "Still talking, aren't you 'White-Haired Men'?"

    During the Second Battle, many of them went to field hospitals to do nursing work and made contributions.

    I once talked to the wounded about their situation. One wounded soldier excitedly said: "These female comrades are not simple. Although they used to be students and hadn't experienced much tempering, their determination is really great! Since they came here, they have been washing our bloody clothes, catching lice, fetching water, fetching food, and feeding us, all day long, without even taking care of their own meals. Some people's hands were swollen from washing our clothes. We said, 'Comrades, take a break, your mother used to wash your clothes at home, didn't she? ... Look, our clothes are covered in blood and stuff, aren't you disgusted?' But they rolled their eyes and said: 'Comrades, don't say that, whose blood are you shedding? ... This is the cleanest thing in the world!' They also catch lice for us. We said, 'How can we thank you!' They jokingly said again: 'The American devils are so big, and you catch hundreds of them, can't I even catch a few small lice?' But, no matter what, we didn't let them handle our excrement; who knew they saw through us again. They retorted: 'Don't you often say we are class brothers, ... why are you so particular? To be honest, I've forgotten I'm a woman these days.' In this way, they are busy all day long, and at night they still have to take up their guns and stand guard!"

    "Hey, there was another female comrade, she was a League member, I will never forget her!" Another wounded soldier lying down, struggled to sit up and said: "At that time, the enemy planes came every day. Lightly wounded soldiers could walk out, but what about us seriously wounded soldiers? She carried us to the air-raid shelters. Once, a total of four or five enemy planes came, firing machine guns and dropping bombs. There were three seriously wounded soldiers in our room. After she carried away two, when she came back the third time to carry me, I saw her head and face covered in sweat and mud, her whole body covered in ash and dirt. I don't know how many times she fell outside. I didn't let her carry me, but she picked me up without saying a word. She wobbled, and as soon as she showed her head, a burst of machine-gun fire rattled beside us; the nearby houses were also bombed, and the smoke made it impossible to see anyone. I said: 'Comrade, put me down, don't let me hurt you!' She turned her head and said seriously: 'Don't say that!' At this time, she really couldn't carry me out anymore, so she put me down against the wall of the house, then climbed on top of me to protect me, and said: 'If the enemy knocks down the house, it will crush me first, I would rather be injured myself than let you be injured a second time!' ... At that time, tears flowed out of my eyes. Comrade, do you think she is worthy of being a Youth League member!..."

    Young friends, you see, with what kind of determination and courage are they spending their youth! Are you also willing to put this kind of heroism into your youth?

    One night, during a march, I walked together with a female comrade. She was not very tall, and looked to be only sixteen or seventeen years old. She was carrying a bag of dried food and a erhu. Two small braids hung under her military cap, swinging lively and lightly as she walked, humming a song softly.

    I asked, "Are you from the cultural troupe?"

    "Yes," she replied, and then told me that she had just returned from the first battalion, where her group had stayed for four days. As she spoke, she continued to hum her song softly.

    I interrupted her and asked, "What did you do these four days?"

    "Well, on the first day we collected heroic examples, on the second day we composed, on the third day we rehearsed, and on the fourth day we performed. We just finished performing today and set off. You see, I haven't even washed off my makeup!" She giggled as she said this; perhaps afraid that I would see the greasepaint on her face, she quickly reached out and grabbed a handful of snow, rubbing it on her face.

    I was surprised by their combat-style work style, and I praised them.

    She said: "But it's very rough! ... However, we just want it to be effective. You think, our soldiers don't have any free time, can you just go and 'embroider flowers'? So we come up with quick and simple things. Without lights, we do it under the moonlight. Without a stage, we do it in the courtyard or on the paddy field. When marching, we give them recitations while they walk. ... We are against showing off in the woods!"

    "You have done a lot of literary and artistic work!"

    "Not just literary and artistic work! We do everything, whatever we come across. I have also been a cook!"

    "A cook?"

    "Uh, the frontline cooks are very busy, they deliver food and water, and also ammunition. I saw that they were too busy, so I asked to be a cook! In addition, I also..."

    "What else?"

    "I also served as a platoon leader in a prisoner-of-war camp for two months!"

    Looking at her small figure and the childish expression in her speech, I couldn't help but laugh.

    "What are you laughing at!" she said seriously: "Don't look at them being so tall, they can't disobey my management, can they? If I tell them to stand, they wouldn't dare to sit!"

    I dared not laugh out loud, but only laughed in my heart. At this moment, suddenly, a whistle sounded, and the troops rested. In a flash, she disappeared. A moment later, I heard her calling out in a young and clear voice from a distant stone cliff:

    "Comrades, shall we sing a song?" Below, everyone said in unison: "Yes!" The song started. In the light of the enemy's searchlights on the opposite bank of the Han River, her arms were moving nimbly, keeping time.

    As the song ended, she came over, holding two jars of cold water scooped from a small river; she gave me one jar, and gulped down the other, "glug, glug, glug." After drinking, she rested with her hands behind her head, her two braids drooping on the snow.

    I couldn't help but think in my head: Half a year or a year ago, they were still spoiled children in front of their parents, and elegant students in school. They might have been alarmed by a girlfriend's finger accidentally cut by a knife, or felt uneasy about a little dirt on their new clothes. But now, they are so calm and happy just a few miles away from the front line, doing so much work on the most intense and sharp battlefield in the world. This is such a magical thing! I couldn't help but exclaim:

    "Comrade! How can you progress so quickly!"

    "Well, it depends on the education of the Party, and also on one's own determination."

    "But, what is your determination?"

    "Me!" She smiled shyly, looked down at her feet, and didn't say anything. After a long while, she said again: "It's about the same as everyone else's!"

    "So, is it to be determined to join the Party?"

    She laughed.

    At this time, a whistle sounded, and the troops moved forward again. She shook the snow from her hair, and we walked together again.

    "However, there is another important reason why we progress so quickly!" she said: "We are often with the soldiers, with the heroes, and we ourselves become brave." She talked very enthusiastically: When she first went abroad, she carried a lot of things and felt unable to walk; but when she saw that the soldiers were carrying even more than them and were saying comic dialogues while walking, she also felt lighter. When the enemy planes fired flares, she felt very scared, but the soldiers said: "They are lighting up the sky for us, it's really good to walk!" She also didn't feel scared anymore. Once, she took care of the wounded, and the other wounded soldiers were happy, but a wounded soldier who had come down from the battle to break through the 38th parallel sighed. She asked him why he wasn't happy, and that wounded soldier said: "Ah, comrade, I shed a little blood, there's nothing to say, but I feel that I should have been wounded south of the 38th parallel, not north of the 38th parallel..." Another time, she went to the front to participate in the battle. When the enemy's artillery fire was raging, several soldiers were nonchalantly sewing shoes there. She was surprised and wondered why the soldiers were doing this irrelevant thing when the artillery fire was raging? When she asked, the soldiers smiled and replied: "If we don't sew shoes, how will we chase the enemy when they collapse!" She said here, looking at me with admiration and saying: "Do you think our soldiers are heroes! After they are wounded, they still think about moving forward, and when the enemy's artillery fire is at its fiercest, they think about chasing! How can we not become brave when we are with such heroes... In the future, we will also,..."

    "Also what!" I asked eagerly.

    "Also..." She laughed softly again for a while, as if it was very difficult to say it directly.

    "Say it!"

    "Will also be heroes." She summoned up her courage and said the beautiful secret of her heart. Then, she forcefully kicked a stone under her feet, and raised her head, even in the darkness, you could see the sparks of youth flashing in her eyes. She said solemnly: "Do you think this is impossible?"

    "Can, of course, can." I quickly nodded and said.

    "Definitely can." She said affirmatively and seriously: "Of course, we are very young, we understand very little, we grew up in a peaceful and quiet environment, we have not yet undergone any rigorous training and tests, that's why, I must put myself in the furnace and see if I am a piece of steel. When the old comrades talk about the arduous struggles and heroic deeds of their era, it attracts me so much. Hero, hero, it attracts my heart completely. I always think, when can I be a hero? What contribution can I make to my country? But, I also think, how did they survive it, they are really great and amazing, this kind of life is so meaningful, ... but I am doing this today, can I not feel happy? Our old League leader always says when he sees me jumping around: 'Little yellow-haired girl! What are you so happy about all day long!' I am happy about this!"

    Young friends, this is how they spend their youth. This is a happy youth, a beautiful youth, a heroic youth! In the Mao Zedong era, who wouldn't want to have such a youth? Friends, Youth League members! I know you love Danya, Paul, and the heroes of our country so much. You often talk about them, and even write Paul's words in your diaries. You often ask yourselves: "Can I be such a hero?" It can be seen how much you yearn for heroic behavior, and how strongly your young lives want to shine with heroic fire. And today, the young people on the Korean battlefield have already given you a shining example. When you read this story of heroic deeds, I want to remind you that half a year or a year ago, they were the same people as you; so, if they can be heroes, you can absolutely do the same. Friends, strive to be a hero of the motherland, there will be nothing more glorious than this. Let us have thousands upon thousands of heroes emerge in thousands upon thousands of posts! Let the flowers of revolutionary heroism of our great motherland bloom everywhere!

　　年轻人，让你的青春更美丽吧
　　魏巍
    青春是美丽的。但一个人的青春可以平庸无奇；也可以放射出英雄的火光。可以因虚度而懊悔；也可以用结结实实的步子，走到辉煌壮丽的成年。
    年青的朋友们，这里，我要向你们报告，毛泽东教导下的知识青年们，在朝鲜战场上，怎样度着自己的青春。
    青年团员戴笃伯，他，二十四岁，是湖南的一个中学生。在志愿军某连当文化教员。他碰到的第一次战斗，是飞虎山战斗。他带着一个担架组抢救伤员。当部队冲上又高又陡的山头、跟敌人展开激战的时候，他还在山脚下蹲着。这时候，像一般初上战场的人一样，他觉着敌人的每一颗炮弹，每一颗子弹，都像专朝着自己飞来。但是，他想：“我能够这样地害怕战争吗！我为什么老蹲在这里？我不是在决心书上写过，要迎接对我的锻炼和考验吗？”他这样想着，就站起来，往山上爬。他刚钻进一个小树林里，霍然，有一颗炮弹正落到一棵树上，把大树炸断了。他又连忙蹲下。这时候，在炮火闪闪的红光里，他看见山头上，一个战士滚下来。不知道是被子弹打中的呢，还是被石头绊倒的。可紧接着，那个战士又从山坡上爬起来，高举着手榴弹，喊着什么，又冲上去了。年轻的戴笃伯心里想：“难道我就不能够前进吗？”他又站起来，努力把腰伸直了些，带着担架小组爬了上去。这时候，阵地已经被我们攻占了。连长一见戴笃伯来了，急忙关切地问：“怎么样呵，戴笃伯？你这是大姑娘坐轿，头一回哩！”戴笃伯笑了笑就准备把阵地上的一个伤员抬下去。可是，山陡，路小，没法抬。戴笃伯就说：“那么，让我来背。”连长不答应，想让别人来背。戴笃伯急得红着脸说：“连长，我的决心书不是白写的呀！”他说着，就把那个伤员背起了。可是，在陡坡上没有走下多远，就满头满脸的汗，跌跌撞撞地走不动了。又挣扎着走了几步，觉得心慌，口渴，头昏，眼花，腿又酸、又软，每迈一步，腿上都像有千把斤重。他想：“一个人怎么这样的重呵，我休息一会儿才好呢。”这当儿，也不知道怎么把伤员碰着了，只听背上“哎哟”了一声。这使他的心比受了最严重的责备还要难过呵。他只扶着一棵小树儿定了定神，就脸朝后，手扒着陡坡，几乎是爬行似的，咬着牙背了下去。……他到底把伤员背到了绑扎所。
    当戴笃伯第二次赶往阵地去的时候，已经不害怕了。而且，他把战士们的水壶灌满了水，叮叮当当背了一身。战士们接到水壶几乎乐得跳起来，拉着他的手，笑着，叫着。……敌人开始冲锋了，大家劝戴笃伯下去。可是，他说：“不！我一定要打一个手榴弹！”敌人冲到面前了，到底戴笃伯跟战士们的手臂一起，平生第一次扔出了一颗手榴弹。这不是一颗普通的手榴弹，这是一颗光彩的手榴弹，这是中国知识青年的锻炼决心！这颗手榴弹，在世界黑暗势力的面前爆炸了；而且，年轻的戴笃伯，他亲自听见了这颗手榴弹爆炸的声音。
    在战士们的请求下，给他记了一功。庆功会那天，他曾经对人说：
    “这是我，戴笃伯平生最快乐的一天！”
    年青的朋友们！你们有过这种快乐吗？你们愿意有这种快乐而光彩的青春吗？
    这里，我还想说一说那些女青年们的情形。在出国之前，为了参加朝鲜庄严伟大的斗争，她们拿着决心书三番五次的请求。不允许，就赖在首长的房子里不走，最后还不答应的时候，她们竟哭了。……她们的哭声是这样的诚挚，以至不得不允许了她们。她们是带着笑，擦干自己年轻的眼泪出国的。
    从跨过鸭绿江的那一天起，她们就背起了多少东西！背着背包，背着十斤干粮，十斤米，一把小铁锹，有的人还有一把小提琴。有一夜，行军九十里，有的男同志还掉了队，但是她们咬着牙，带着满脚泡，连距离都没有拉下。过冰河，她们也像男同志一样，卷起裤脚哗哗地淌过去。冰块划破了腿，就偷偷地包上也不言声。露营了，就在山坡上用松树枝支起一块小雨布，挤在一起，夜间冻醒，就蹦一蹦，跳一跳再睡。第二天早起，她们的头发上结满了霜。男同志们笑她们说：“嘿，你们演《白毛女》都不用化装了！”她们也笑男同志：“还说哩，你看，你们不是‘白毛男’吗？”
    二次战役时，她们有不少人到野战医院做护理工作，立了功。
    我曾经和伤员们谈起她们的情形。有一个伤员兴奋地说：“这些女同志，可不简单哩。虽说人家以前是些学生，没经过什么锻炼，可是决心真大！自打她们到这儿来，给我们洗血衣呀，捉虱子呀，打水、打饭、喂饭呀，一天到晚，饭都顾不得吃。有些人给我们洗衣服手都泡肿了。我们就说：‘同志呀，歇会儿吧，在家里，你的衣服还是你妈妈给你洗呢？……你看，我们的衣服又是血什么的，你不嫌脏吗？’可是，她们翻翻眼说：‘同志，你再别说这个，你们的血是为了谁流的呢？………这是世界上最干净的东西！’另外还给我们捉虱子。我们说：‘这该怎么谢你呢！’她们就又开玩笑地说：‘美国鬼子那么老大个子，你们还百儿八十的捉呢，难道我连几个小小的虱子都捉不了吗？’可是，无论如何，我们不让她们端大小便；谁知道又叫她们看破了。她们就反问我们：‘你们不是常说阶级弟兄么，……为什么分得这么清呢？实说吧，这些天，我已经忘记了我是个女的了。’就这样，她们白天忙一天，夜间还要拿着枪去担任警戒哩！”
    “嘿，还有一个女同志，她是个团员，提起她我一辈子都忘不了！”另一个躺着的伤员、挣起身子坐起来说：“那时候，敌人的飞机天天来，轻伤员能够走出去，可是我们重伤员怎么办呢？她就把我们往防空洞里面背。有一次，敌机一共来了四五架，又是打机关炮，又是扔炸弹。我们屋里一共三个重伤员，等到她背走两个，第三趟回来背我的时候，我看见她满头满脸又是汗，又是泥，浑身上下都是灰、土，不知道她在外面跌了多少跤呵。我就不让她背，可是她不由分说地，又把我背起了。她摇摇晃晃地，刚一露头，一梭子机关炮咕咕咕打在我们旁边；附近的房子也炸着了，冒的烟看不见人。我就说：‘同志，你把我放下吧，不要让我连累了你！’她扭过头来严肃地说：‘你不要这样说！’这时候，也确实背不出去了，她就把我靠屋墙根放下来，然后爬在我的身上护着我，并且说：‘假若敌人把房子打倒，先压住我，我宁让我自己负伤，也不能再让你负第二次伤！’…………当时，我的泪都流出来了，同志，你说她够不够一个青年团员！………”
    年青的朋友们，你们看，她们是以何等的决心和气魄度着自己的青春！你们也愿意把这种豪气放在自己的青春之中吗？
    有一天晚上，在行军中，我和一个女同志走在一起。她个子不很高，看样子不过十六七岁。她背着干粮袋，还有一把二胡。两个小辫子、在军帽下垂着，游打游打的，活泼而轻快地走着，还轻轻地哼着什么歌儿。
    我问：“你是文工团的吗？”
    “是呀，”她回答，接着就告诉我她是才从一营回来的，她们那个小组在那儿呆了四天。说着，又继续轻轻哼着她的歌儿。
    我打断她，又问：“这四天，你们做了些什么呢？”
    “我们哪，第一天搜集英雄例子，第二天就编，第三天就排，第四天就演。今天刚刚演完，就出发了，你看，弄得我化的装还没有洗呢！”说到这儿，咯咯地笑起来；也许是怕我看见她脸上涂着的油彩，连忙伸手抓了一把雪，往脸上搓着。
    我为她们这种战斗式的工作作风惊讶了，我称赞着。
    她说：“可是粗糙得很哩！………不过，我们想起到作用就是了。你想，咱们的战士们那有闲空，你光去‘绣花’能行吗？所以我们就来快的，简单的。没有灯，就在月光底下。没有台子，就在院子里，稻田上。行军的时候，战士们一边走，我们就一边给他们说唱。………我们反对树林子里头耍大刀！”
    “你们的文艺工作可做得真不少哩！”
    “不只文艺工作哩！我们哪，是什么也做，碰到什么做什么。我还做过伙夫呢！”
    “伙夫？”
    “呃，前方炊事员可忙哩，他们又送饭又送水，还要送弹药。我看他们忙不过来，就要求当伙夫！另外，我还……”
    “怎么样？”
    “我还当了两个月俘虏营的排长哩！”
    我看着她那小小的个儿，说话那种孩子气的神气，不由得笑起来。
    “你笑什么！”她正正经经地说：“你别看他们那么老高个子，他不服从我管理行吗？我叫他们站着，他们就不敢坐着！”
    我不敢大声笑，只在心里笑着。这时候，忽然，哨音一响，部队休息了。一闪眼，看不见她。一会儿，听见远处一个石崖上，她用年轻而清脆的声音喊道：
    “同志们，我们唱个歌儿好不好？”下面齐声说：“好！”歌声起了。在汉江对岸敌人探照灯的亮光里，她的臂膀在轻捷地舞动着打着拍子。
    歌声一落，她走过来，端着两缸子从小河里舀来的冷水；给了我一缸子，另一缸子，她“瓜冬瓜冬”就喝了下去。喝过，两只手在脑后一叉就仰着休息起来，两条辫子垂在积雪上。
    我不由得在脑子里回想着：当半年或者一年之前，她们在父母面前，还是一个娇声娇气的孩子，在学校里是一个文雅的学生。她们也许因为女友的手指头偶然被小刀划破而大惊小怪，为了自己的新衣服碰上一点点脏而心神不安，而现在竟然在离前线几里路的地方，这样的坦然、愉快，在全世界斗争最激烈最尖锐的战场上做了这许多工作。这是多么神奇的一件事情！我不由得感叹地说：
    “同志！你们的进步怎么这样的快呵！”
    “那，靠党的教育，也要靠自己有决心。”
    “可是，你的决心是什么呢？”
    “我呀！”她羞涩地笑着，低头看着自己的脚，没有说下去。呆了半晌，才又说：“和别人的也差不多！”
    “那么，是要决心入党吗？”
    她笑了。
    这时候哨音一响，部队又前进了。她抖了抖头发上的雪，我们又走在一起。
    “不过，我们进步得快，还有一个重要的原因哩！”她说：“我们和战士们常在一起，和英雄们在一起，我们自己也就勇敢起来了。”她非常有兴味地谈着：开始出国的时候，她背得东西很多，觉得走不动；可一看战士们比她们背得还重，并且边走边说快板，自己也就走得轻快了。敌机打照明弹，自己觉得很害怕，可是战士们却说：“给咱们点起天灯啦，真好走！”自己也就不觉得害怕了。有一次，她看护伤员，别的伤员乐哈哈的，有一个突破三八线战役下来的伤员却唉声叹气的。她问他为什么不高兴，那个伤员说：“唉，同志，我流了点血，没有什么说的，只是我觉得我应该冲到三八线以南负伤，不该在三八线以北就负了伤……”另一次，她到前方参加战斗。敌人的炮火打得正猛烈的时候，有几个战士却在那儿满不在乎地缝鞋子。她惊讶地想，为什么炮火连天的时候，战士们干这不相干的事情呢？一问，战士们笑着回答：“不缝鞋子，等一会敌人垮了，怎么追击呢！”她说到这里，瞧着我赞叹地说：“你看咱们的战士是不是英雄！在他们负伤以后，还想的是前进，在敌人的炮火最猛烈的时候，想的是追击！我们跟这样的英雄在一起，怎么会不勇敢起来呢…………我们将来，也会，……”
    “也会怎样呵！”我追问。
    “也会……”她低声又笑了一阵，好像很不容易直说出来。
    “说呀！”
    “也会当英雄的。”她鼓足勇气，说出了她的心灵的美丽的秘密。然后，她用力踢开一块脚下的石子，抬起头来，在黑夜里，也可以看出她的眼睛里闪着青春的火星。她严正地说：“你以为这是不可能的吗？”
    “能够的，当然能够的。”我连忙点头说。
    “一定能够的。”她肯定而严肃地说：“当然，我们很年轻，我们懂得的事情还很少，我们是在平平静静的环境里长大的，我们还没有经过什么严格的锻炼和考验，正是这样，我必须把我放在炉火里，看看我是不是块钢铁。当老同志们谈起他们那时代的艰苦斗争和英雄事迹的时候，是多么吸引我。英雄，英雄，它把我的心全部地吸引了。我总是想，我什么时候才能当一个英雄呢？才能给我的祖国一种什么贡献呢？但是，我又想，他们究竟是怎么熬过的呢，他们真伟大真了不起呵，这种生活是多么有意义呵，……可我今天呢，也是在这样做着了，我能不感觉快乐吗？我们的老团长看见我蹦蹦跳跳的，总是说：‘小黄毛丫头！一天乐呵呵的乐什么哩！’我就是乐的这个呀！”
    年青的朋友们，他们就是这样度着青春的。这是快乐的青春，美丽的青春，英雄的青春！毛泽东时代的年轻人，谁不愿意有这样的青春呢。朋友们，青年团员们！我知道你们是那样地喜爱丹娘、保尔和我们祖国的英雄们。你们常常谈着他们，甚而把保尔的话写在自己的日记上。你们常常向自己发问：我“能不能做这样的英雄呢？”可见你们对英雄行为是多么向往，你们年轻的生命是多么强烈地愿意闪出英雄的火光。而今天朝鲜战场上的青年们，已经给了你们光辉的榜样。当你们读到这篇英雄事迹的时候，我想提醒你，在半年或者一年之前，他们是跟你们一样的人；那么，他们可以做英雄，你们也是完全可以这样做的。朋友们，为做一个祖国的英雄而奋发努力吧，不会有比这再光荣的了。让我们在千千万万的岗位上，出现千千万万的英雄吧！让我们伟大的祖国革命英雄主义的花朵遍地齐放吧！
