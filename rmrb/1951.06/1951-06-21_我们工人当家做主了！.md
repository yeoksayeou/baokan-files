　　We Workers Are Masters of Our Own Destiny!
　　Editor:
　　I am a worker at the Jiulonggang Factory of the Huainan Railway. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, I participated in a skills test. At that time, those with connections or backing could get a base salary of 2.2 yuan with a score of 60. I also scored 60, but only got a base salary of 1.7 yuan. After liberation, comrades told me: "Those who bully others by relying on their power will be overthrown." I was very happy when I heard that, and I worked harder and harder. After a while, I saw some of the bad elements from the past climbing back up, talking big, not doing real work, and their style was almost the same as before. Seeing this situation, I didn't dare to say what I wanted to say, and my work enthusiasm gradually declined.
　　When the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began, some people said behind their backs: there are too many people on the railway, there will be layoffs; others said that even if counter-revolutionary elements are exposed, the government will not punish them. At this time, I was half-believing and half-doubting the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, thinking in my heart: If exposing special agents doesn't lead to punishment, we will be retaliated against in the future, and that would be unbearable. Later, after the explanation and help of comrades like Gao A'er, I boldly exposed two special agents, Li Jian and Bao Meicun. These two special agents have been detained. Now I feel that we workers are truly masters of our own destiny. When the Japanese devils were here, I worked a whole day and only earned enough for one meal, and it was moldy noodles, and the rice was all broken rice. During the Kuomintang rule, there's no need to even mention the suffering; I received my wages in the morning, but couldn't buy anything by evening. We also had to endure the anger of the directors and foremen when we worked. Now it is completely different. In the morning, we can eat steamed buns and drink porridge. At noon, we eat dry rice, and in the evening, we eat noodles and steamed buns. My children are also in school. I don't have to worry about family life, so I'm more motivated to work. Last year, it took 32 workers to repair a standard freight car, but this year it only took 16 workers to repair it, and the quality is twice as good as last year. In the future, in production, I will put in as much effort as I can, and I will help backward elements to make progress. Chairman Mao has brought us happiness. We must step up production in the future to thank Chairman Mao!

### 我们工人当家做主了！

　　我们工人当家做主了！编辑同志：
    我是淮南铁路九龙岗工厂的工人。我曾在国民党反动统治时期，参加考工。当时有人情有仗恃的，考六十分，可得到二元二角底薪。我也考了六十分，只得到一元七角底薪。解放以后，同志们告诉我说：“仗势欺人的人，是要被打倒的。”我当时听了很高兴，我的活越干越有劲了。过了一个时期，我看见过去的一些坏蛋又爬上去了，又说大话，不干真事，和过去的作风差不多。我一看这个情形，想说的话也不敢说了，工作情绪渐渐低落下来。
    镇压反革命开始时，有人背后说：铁路上的人太多了，要裁人；有的说检举出反革命分子，政府也是不惩办。这时我对镇压反革命是半信半疑，心里想：检举出特务要是不办，将来要遭到报复，那可吃不消。后来经过高阿二等同志的解释帮助，我就大胆地检举了李健、鲍梅村两个特务。这两个特务已被扣起来了。我现在感觉我们工人真是当家做主了。日本鬼子在时，我做了一天的工，只够吃一顿饭，并且吃的是霉面，米都是碎米嘴。国民党统治时，那种苦也就不用说了，早晨领了工钱，到晚上就买不到东西了。干活还要受什么主任、工长的气。现在可大不相同了。早晨能吃馒头、喝稀饭。中午吃大米干饭，晚上吃面条馒头了。小孩也上了学。家庭生活不用焦心了，所以干活也有劲了。去年我们修的标准货车，要用三十二个工，今年只要十六个工就修好了，质量还比去年提高一倍。今后在生产上，我要有多大劲，使多大劲，要帮助落后分子进步。毛主席给我们带来了幸福。我们要今后加紧生产，来感谢毛主席！
