The spring afforestation work in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces has now concluded. The focus of afforestation in these four provinces this spring was on planting protective forests and water source forests. To date, farmers in these four provinces have planted over 100.7 million trees, not including the many trees planted by farmers scattered within their villages or around their houses. In Hunan Province alone, farmers have planted over 44 million trees, afforesting an area of 150,000 mu, exceeding the province's original plan by more than 70%.

Due to the Yellow River's historical course changes, there are approximately 4 million mu of sandy wasteland in eastern Henan Province. This spring, local farmers planted over 6 million trees on these sandy wastelands. Farmers in areas such as Lanfeng, Zhongmu, Suixian, and Qixian also systematically constructed windbreak and sand fixation forest belts and networks, covering approximately 164,000 mu. In addition, to support the project to fundamentally control the Huai River's flood problems, farmers in the upper reaches of the Huai River watershed in Henan Province enclosed 240,000 mu of mountains for forest cultivation and planted over 1.6 million trees this spring to preserve the soil and water on both banks of the upper reaches of the Huai River. Similarly, along the Hanshui River in Hubei Province, the Yuan River in Hunan Province, and the Gan River in Jiangxi Province, farmers also planted many trees this spring to protect the riverbanks. Farmers along the Yuan River alone planted 2 million willow trees this spring. Residents in the western and northern mountainous areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces also planted a large number of tung oil trees and lacquer trees this spring.

The People's Governments of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces paid close attention to leading farmers in afforestation work this spring. When mobilizing farmers for afforestation, forestry cadres at all levels widely publicized the People's Government's afforestation policies to farmers and also did their best to help farmers solve the problem of tree seedling shortages. The forestry farms in Henan Province alone supplied farmers with over 5 million tree seedlings this spring, equivalent to half the number of trees planted by farmers in the province this spring. The primary methods used by local forestry cadres to mobilize farmers for afforestation were to organize farmers to jointly afforest or to implement public-private cooperative afforestation between local forestry institutions and farmers. For example, in Henan Province this spring, over 23,000 farmers organized more than 2,000 cooperative afforestation groups to carry out afforestation. The Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also provided 80,000 tung tree seedlings this spring and cooperated with farmers in Nansiang Township, Changsha, to afforest over 2,000 mu. This form of cooperative afforestation has been widely welcomed by farmers in various places. Currently, farmers in various places are actively organizing forest protection committees or forest protection groups to protect these newly planted forests and existing forests.

### 河南湖北湖南江西四省  春季植树一亿余株  防御风沙保护水源

　　河南湖北湖南江西四省
    春季植树一亿余株
    防御风沙保护水源
    河南、湖北、湖南、江西等省的春季造林工作现已结束。这四省今春的造林工作是以植造防护林和水源林为主。到现在止，四省农民已先后植树一亿零七百多万株，许多农民在自己的村内或屋边分散种的树尚未计算在内。其中仅湖南省农民共已植树四千四百多万株，造林面积达十五万亩，超过该省原订计划的百分之七十以上。
    河南省东部因黄河历次改道，约有四百多万亩沙荒地；今春当地农民就在这些沙荒地上植树六百多万株。兰封、中牟、睢县、杞县等地区的农民还有计划地建造了防风沙的林带和林网，约占地十六万四千亩。此外，为了配合根治淮河水患的工程，河南省境淮河水系上游地区的农民今春共封山育林二十四万亩，植树一百六十多万株，以保持淮河上游两岸的水土。其它如在湖北省境的汉水、湖南省境的沅江，以及江西省境的赣江沿岸，农民今春也种了许多树，保护河岸。仅沅江两岸农民今春即插柳二百万株。江西、湖南、湖北等省西部和北部山区的居民，今春还种植了大量的油桐和漆树等。
    河南、湖北、湖南、江西等省人民政府今春非常注意领导农民植树造林的工作。各级林业干部在发动农民造林时，普遍地向农民宣传了人民政府的造林政策，同时尽力帮助农民解决缺少树苗的困难。仅河南省各林场今春供给农民的树苗即有五百多万株，等于该省农民今春植树数的一半。各地林业干部发动农民植树造林的方式，主要是组织农民合作造林或由当地林业机构与农民实行公私合作造林。如河南省今春就有两万三千多农民组织了二千多个合作造林小组，进行造林；湖南省农林厅今春也曾拿出八万株桐树苗，和长沙南汜乡农民合作造林两千多亩。这种合作造林的方式，普遍得到各地农民的欢迎。现在，各地农民正纷纷组织护林委员会或护林小组，以保护这些新造的树林和原有的树林。
