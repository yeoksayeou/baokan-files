            Section 5. Adjuncts, coordinate components, appositive components, extrapositive components
    Adjectives of nouns. The adjectives of nouns can take various forms, usually connected to the noun with the word "的" (de). For example:
    (1) Noun: The people of China.
    (2) Pronoun: Our hometown; this place.
    (3) Adjective: A magnificent army.
    (4) Verb: A parade of processions.
    (5) Verb-object phrase: The movement to create new records.
    (6) Sentence form: The experience that the Chinese people have accumulated over decades. The sentence form as an adjective may be complex in itself, such as the part in parentheses in this sentence:
    (7) You can only be the kind of armchair literati or armchair artist (that Lu Xun earnestly exhorted his son not to be in his will). (Mao)
    A noun often has several adjectives at the same time, for example:
    (8) Popular literature and art refers to things (that are less processed), (that are coarser), (and therefore more easily accepted by the broad masses of the people at present). (Mao)
    (9) The revolutionary energy (that was once hidden underground) (and invisible to foreigners) (of the great Russian proletariat and working people)... suddenly erupted. (Mao)
    But no matter how many or how complex the adjectives are, they cannot turn a simple sentence into a compound sentence. The difference between simple and compound sentences lies not in length, but in their basic structure. Simple sentences can be very long, and compound sentences can be very short.
    Adjectives of verbs. The adjectives of nouns generally precede the noun, while the adjectives of verbs can be either before or after the verb. Examples of those that precede:
    (10) Noun: Published in 1951.
    (11) Pronoun: Say it this way.
    (12) Adverb: Say again; say it again; don't say.
    (13) Adjective: Walk slowly; walk slowly.
    (14) Verb: Run fast; say with a smile.
    (15) Verb-object phrase: From the masses, to the masses; serve the people; exercise dictatorship over the reactionaries; talk to him; solve the problem for him; erupt like a volcano. (See paragraphs 41, 42, and 43 of Section 4.) It is obvious that (15) is the most commonly used form of verb adjective.
    Verb adjectives that follow the verb are connected with the word "得" (de) (also written as "的" by some), and some are not. The ones that are not used are some verb-object phrases of the same type as (15):
    (16) Sit at home; throw oneself into production; be reduced to annihilation; move towards peace. The ones connected with the word "得" (de) are:
    (17) Adjective: Walk slowly; write shorter, write more succinctly.
    (18) Verb or verb-object phrase: Fall and not be able to get up; laugh until you can't speak.
    (19) Sentence form: Tired and sweating profusely; making everyone unable to sleep. In terms of meaning, all the adjectives after the verb have the meaning of expressing the result of the action, especially those connected with the word "得" (de). The adjectives before the verb express various meanings, such as time, space, state, manner, means, purpose, relationship, and characters.
    The combination of verbs and adjectives. Some special adjectives have a closer relationship with verbs. Some have become suffixes of verbs, some can still be separated, and some can be said to form a compound verb with the verb, or at least form a verb group. When not analyzing in detail, we may as well treat these combinations as a unit. These components can be divided into four categories.
    The first category is those that have become suffixes, namely "着 (zhe)" and "了 (le)".
    The second category is intermediate in nature between verb suffixes and compound verb components, but can be separated, so it is similar to an adverb. These are "来 (lai)", "去 (qu)", "上 (shang)", "下 (xia)", "起 (qi)", "住 (zhu)", "开 (kai)", "过 (guo)", "了 (liao)", "着 (zhao)", and the compound forms "上来 (shanglai)", "下去 (xiaqu)", "起来 (qilai)", "过去 (guoqu)".
    The third category is general verbs and adjectives, but they are tightly combined with the preceding verb, and almost no other words can be inserted except "得 (de)" and "不 (bu)", thus making people feel as if it is just one word. For example, "赶走 (ganzou)" (drive away), "打倒 (dadao)" (overthrow), "放大 (fangda)" (enlarge), "收紧 (shoujin)" (tighten), "刷白 (shua bai)" (paint white), "熏黑 (xunhei)" (smoke black). These were all monosyllabic words originally. If either the verb or the adjective was originally a disyllabic word, we would clearly realize their separability and would not have the feeling of a single word. For example, "洗干净 (xi ganjing)" (wash clean), "驱逐走 (quzhu zou)" (drive away), "说明白 (shuoming bai)" (explain clearly), "收束紧 (shoushu jin)" (tie tightly).
    The fourth category is "能 (neng)", "会 (hui)", "敢 (gan)", "肯 (ken)", which are all genuine verbs, capable of acting as predicates alone (I can, you can, he is willing, you dare?), but because their objects are always another verb, we feel that they are a combination, a unit.
    Adjectives of adjectives. Adjectives also have two types: those that precede and those that follow. Those that precede are like:
    (20) Adjective: Really good; strangely good-looking.
    (21) Adverb: Very good; also good; still good; not good. Those that follow, except for "极 (ji)" and "透 (tou)", are all connected with the word "得 (de)". Such as:
    (22) Adverb: Very good; extremely good; completely bad.
    (23) Verb or verb-object phrase: So small that it's unbelievable; so small that you can't tell if it's square or round.
    (24) Sentence form: So small that it's invisible to the naked eye. Adjectives are all expressions of degree.
    Adjectives of the whole sentence. Some adjectives do not belong to a single word but to the entire sentence. For example, "反正 (fanzheng)" (anyway), "当然 (dangran)" (of course), "幸而 (xing'er)" (fortunately), "老实说 (laoshi shuo)" (to be honest), "严格地说 (yange de shuo)" (strictly speaking), "一般地说 (yiban de shuo)" (generally speaking), "就...说 (jiu...shuo)" (speaking of...), "以...而论 (yi...erlun)" (in terms of...), "在...看来 (zai...kanlai)" (in ...'s opinion), etc.
    Coordinate components. Two or more words or phrases can be combined to form a subject, predicate, object, predicate nominative, or adjective. For example:
    (25) Subject: The civilization of the Western bourgeoisie, the bourgeois democracy, and the program of the bourgeois republic all went bankrupt in the minds of the Chinese people. (Mao)
    (26) Predicate: We wear clothes and eat every day, so we should know the production process of clothing and food.
    (27) Object: In despair, Sun Yat-sen encountered the October Revolution and the Communist Party of China. (Mao)
    (28) Predicate nominative: These four classes are the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie.
    (29) Adjective: The international and domestic situation is favorable to us. (Mao)
    Two verbs combine to govern an object, which is a new structure, for example:
    (30) Observe and handle problems from different class standpoints.
    Whether to use conjunctions between two combined components, and what conjunctions to use, generally has a standard. If it is a noun or pronoun, you can use "和 (he)", "跟 (gen)", "与 (yu)". If it is an adjective, the traditional conjunction is "而 (er)", and now "和 (he)" and "与 (yu)" are also used, but it is more common not to use them. If it is a verb, the general habit is not to use a conjunction; in special occasions (such as 30), "和 (he)", "与 (yu)" or "并 (bing)" are also used.
    Between three or more combined components, the general habit is not to use conjunctions. Now it is also common to imitate Western grammar and add a conjunction between the last two.
    Appositive components. Two words or phrases that actually refer to the same thing, we superimpose them and use them in a sentence, using one as a sentence component and the other to explain it, we say that the first is the main component and the second is the appositive component of the first. The appositive component can be added before the main component, and there is no difference in form from ordinary adjectives, except that the word "的 (de)" cannot be added. For example:
    (31) The Chinese people love their leader Mao Zedong. It can also be placed after the main component, at which time there is often a pause between the two, as in example (33).
    (32) The Chinese people have found Marxism-Leninism, this universal truth that applies everywhere. (Mao)
    (33) These two aspects, the democratic aspect towards the people and the dictatorial aspect towards the reactionaries, are combined with each other, which is the people's democratic dictatorship. (Mao) Sometimes, the two components are connected by "也就是 (yejiu shi)" (that is), "即 (ji)" (namely) or "或 (huo)" (or). For example:
    (34) These are the culture of Western bourgeois democracy, namely the so-called new learning... and the culture of Chinese feudalism, namely the so-called old learning, are opposed to each other. (Mao)
    (35) The method we use in this respect is the democratic method, namely the method of persuasion, not the method of coercion. (Mao)
    (36) The democracy mentioned here is in line with the people's democracy or new democracy we are talking about. (Mao)
    Extrapositive components. Sometimes, we break up two words or phrases that actually refer to the same thing and put them in two places, using one as a sentence component and putting the other at the head of the sentence. We call this component outside the structure the extrapositive component, and the component within the structure the main component, the latter often being a pronoun. The underlined parts in the examples below are extrapositive components.
    (37) Any subjectivism, sectarianism, or Party jargon should make it difficult to sell in the market. (Mao)
    ("它 (ta)" = "任何……货色 (renhe...huose)" - "any...stuff")
    (38) To combine firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, etc. to create something to eat, this is not an easy task. (Mao) ("这 (zhe)" = "要把……东西 (yao ba...dongxi)" - "to combine...")
                                      (End of this section, the whole article is not finished)

　　语法、修辞讲话
　　吕叔湘　朱德熙
            第五段  附加成分、联合成分、同位成分、外位成分
    名词的附加语。  名词的附加语可以有各种格式，通常都用“的”字连接在名词的前头。例如：
    （一）名词：中国的人民。
    （二）代词：我们的家乡；这个地方。
    （三）形容词：雄壮的队伍。
    （四）动词：游行的行列。
    （五）动宾短语：创造新纪录的运动。
    （六）句子形式：中国人民在几十年中积累起来的经验。句子形式作附加语，它的本身可能是复杂的，例如这一句的括号里面的：
    （七）你就只能做（鲁迅在他的遗嘱里所谆谆嘱咐他的儿子万不可做的）那种空头文学家或空头艺术家。（毛）
    一个名词也常常同时有好几个附加语，例如：
    （八）普及的文艺是指（加工较少、）（较粗糙、）（因此也较易为目前广大人民群众所迅速接受的）东西。（毛）
    （九）（过去蕴藏在地下）（为外国人所看不见的）（伟大的俄国无产阶级及劳动人民的）革命精力……突然爆发出来了。（毛）
    可是无论附加语怎么多或是怎么复杂，它不能叫一个简单句变成复合句。简单句和复合句的区别不在于长短，在于它们的基本结构。简单句可能很长，复合句也可能很短。
    动词的附加语。  名词的附加语一般都在名词的前面，动词的附加语有在前的，也有在后的。在前的例子：
    （十）名词：一九五一年出版。
    （十一）代词：这么说。
    （十二）副词：又说；再说；不说。
    （十三）形容词：慢走；慢慢地走。
    （十四）动词：飞跑；笑着说。
    （十五）动宾短语：从群众中来，到群众中去；为人民服务；对反动派专政；和他说话；给他解决问题；像火山一样地爆发出来。（参看第四段四一、四二、四三）显而易见，（十五）是动词附加语之中最常用的格式。
    动词后面的附加语有用“得”字（也有人写“的”）连接的，有不用的。不用的是跟（十五）同类的一些动宾短语：
    （十六）坐在家里；投到生产上去；归于消灭；走向和平。用“得”字连接的是：
    （十七）形容词：走得慢；写得短些，写得精粹些。
    （十八）动词或动宾短语：摔得爬不起来；笑得说不出话来。
    （十九）句子形式：累得满头大汗；闹得大家不能睡觉。就意义方面说，凡是动词后面的附加语都有表示动作结果的意思，用“得”字连接的尤其明显。动词前面的附加语表示的意思是多方面的，时间、空间、状态、方式、手段、目的、关系人物、都可以用它表示。
    动词和附加成分的结合。有一些特殊的附加成分，跟动词的关系更加密切。有些已经成为动词的词尾，有些还可以分离，有些可以说是跟动词合成一个复合动词，或至少是组成一个动词群。不详细分析的时候，我们不妨把这类结合体都当做一个单位看待。这些成分可以分成四类。
    第一类是已经成为词尾的，就是“着（ｚｈｅ）”和“了（ｌｅ）”。
    第二类的性质介于词尾和复合动词的成分之间，但是能分离，因此又近似副词。就是“来”“去”“上”“下”“起”“住”“开”“过”“了（ｌｉａｏ）”“着（ｚｈａｏ）”以及“上来”“下去”“起来”“过去”这些复合形式。
    第三类是一般的动词和形容词，但是它们和前面的动词结合得很紧，除了“得”和“不”外，几乎插不进别的字去，因而使人觉得好像只是一个词。例如“赶走”“打倒”“放大”“收紧”“刷白”“熏黑”。这些原来都是单音词。要是动词或是附加成分有一个原来是双音词，我们就明显地意识到它们的分离性，不会有一个词的感觉。例如“洗干净”“驱逐走”“说明白”“收束紧”。
    第四类是“能”“会”“敢”“肯”这些，都是地道动词，能单独做谓语（我会，你能，他肯，你敢？），但是因为它们的宾语老是另一个动词，我们就觉得它们是一个结合体，是一个单位。
    形容词的附加语。  形容词的附加语也有在前和在后两类。在前面的如：
    （二十）形容词：真好；怪好看的。
    （二一）副词：很好；也好；还好；不好。
    （二二）动宾短语：像海水那样深；比海水深。在后面的，除“极”和“透”外，都用“得”字连接。如：
    （二三）副词：好得很；好极了；坏透了。
    （二四）动词或动宾短语：小得不得了；小得看不出是方的还是圆的。
    （二五）句子形式：小得肉眼看不见。形容词的附加语都是表示程度的。
    全句的附加语。  有一些附加语是不属于一个词而属于全句的。例如“反正”“当然”“幸而”“老实说”“严格地说”“一般地说”“就………说”“以…………而论”“在……看来”等等。
    联合成分。  两个或更多的词或短语，可以联合起来做主语、谓语、宾语、表语、或附加语。例如：
    （二六）主语：西方资产阶级的文明，资产阶级的民主主义，资产阶级共和国的方案，在中国人的心目中，一齐破了产。（毛）
    （二七）谓语：我们天天穿衣吃饭，应该知道衣和饭的生产过程。
    （二八）宾语：孙中山在绝望里，遇到了十月革命和中国共产党。（毛）
    （二九）表语：这四个阶级就是工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级。
    （三十）附加语：国际和国内的形势都对我们有利。（毛）
    两个动词联合起来管一个宾语，这是新起的构造，例如：
    （三一）从不同的阶级立场出发去观察和处理问题。
    联合的两个成分中间，用不用连接词，用什么连接词，大致有一个标准。假如是名词或代词，可以用“和”“跟”“与”。假如是形容词，传统的连接词是“而”，现在也有用“和”“与”的，但是更普通的是不用。假如是动词，一般的习惯是不用连接词；在特殊的场合（如三一），也用“和”“与”或“并”。
    三个以上的联合成分之间，一般习惯是不用连接词。现在也常常仿效西洋语法，在最后两个之间加用连接词。
    同位成分。  实际上指相同的事物的两个词或短语，我们把它们重叠起来用在句子里，用一个做句子的成分，用另一个来解释它，我们就说第一个是本位成分，第二个是第一个的同位成分。同位成分可以加在本位成分的前面，形式上跟普通附加语没分别，只是不能加“的”字。例如：
    （三二）中国人民热爱他们的领袖毛泽东。也可以放在本位成分的后面，这个时候两者之间往往有一个停顿，如（三四）例。
    （三三）中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。（毛）
    （三四）这两方面，对人民内部的民主方面和对反动派的专政方面，互相结合起来，就是人民民主专政。（毛）有时候，用“也就是”“即”或“或”把这两个成分连接起来。例如：
    （三五）这些是西方资产阶级民主主义的文化，即所谓新学………和中国封建主义的文化即所谓旧学是对立的。（毛）
    （三六）我们在这方面使用的方法，是民主的即说服的方法，而不是强迫的方法。（毛）
    （三七）这里所说的民权主义，是和我们所说的人民民主主义或新民主主义相符合的。（毛）
    外位成分。  有时候，我们又把实际上指相同事物的两个词或短语拆开来放在两个地方，用一个做句子的成分，把另外一个放在句子的头上。我们就管这个居于结构之外的成分叫外位成分，管那个结构之内的成分叫本位成分，后者常常是一个代词。底下例子里加点的是外位成分。
    （三八）任何主观主义、宗派主义、党八股的货色，应该使它在市场上销售困难。（毛）
    （“它”＝“任何……货色”。）
    （三九）要把柴米油盐酱醋等件合起来创造成吃的东西，这是并不容易的事情。（毛）（“这”＝“要把………东西”。）
                                      （本段完，全文未完）
