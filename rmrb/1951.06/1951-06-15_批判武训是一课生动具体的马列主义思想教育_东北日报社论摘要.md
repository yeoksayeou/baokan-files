　　Criticizing Wu Xun is a Vivid and Concrete Marxist-Leninist Ideological Education
　　-- Excerpts from a *Northeast Daily* Editorial

    The *Northeast Daily* published an editorial on June 10 entitled "Criticizing Wu Xun is a Vivid and Concrete Marxist-Leninist Ideological Education," calling on Party organizations and cultural and educational circles at all levels to launch a discussion on the Wu Xun issue, and to improve the Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought level of Party members and cadres through this discussion.

    The editorial first pointed out the serious situation of ideological confusion in the Northeast education and cultural circles: "In the third volume of the high school Chinese textbook compiled and edited by the former 'Northeast Administrative Committee Education Department' and published by the Northeast Bookstore in 1949, the lesson 'Excerpts from Speeches at the Wu Xun Memorial Meeting' was selected, in which Wu Xun was highly praised. This textbook has already spread harmful influences among the broad masses of teachers and students. The Lushun Teachers School hung a portrait of Wu Xun in front of the school gate, and also planned to build a 'Wu Xun Pavilion' to promote Wu Xun's 'tenacious spirit' in running schools. The Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education specially screened the film *The Life of Wu Xun* at the evening party of the Excellent Cultural and Educational Workers Conference for learning purposes. The responsible comrade of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education also encouraged the masses to run schools with the spirit of Wu Xun at the first People's Representative Conference in the Beishi District, which aroused blind worship among the masses. The *Literacy Newsletter* published by the Songjiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education serialized the comic strip *The Life of Wu Xun* to promote the literacy movement. In addition, there are books and periodicals praising Wu Xun circulating on the market, such as *Wu Xun Pictorial Biography*, *Eternal Strange Beggar*, the film novel *The Life of Wu Xun*, *Biography of Mr. Wu Xun*, and several comic strips about Wu Xun, etc."

    The editorial continued: "The issue raised by *The Life of Wu Xun* is an issue of class stand and class viewpoint. The reactionary propaganda praising Wu Xun, the supporter of feudal rule, can have its 'market' among revolutionary cultural and educational workers, including some Communist Party members. Not only has it not been criticized, but some comrades have also praised and promoted it. This shows that these comrades have deviated from the proletarian stand, deviated from the Marxist-Leninist stand, and blurred the basic viewpoints of historical materialism and class struggle on the issue of Wu Xun. It is precisely because they observe problems by leaving class character that they come to a set of wrong conclusions. Blurring the basic viewpoints of class struggle will, to varying degrees, be corroded by various forms of reactionary views of class reconciliation and by bourgeois reformist thought. Therefore, attaching importance to the discussion of the film *The Life of Wu Xun*, exposing and eliminating the wrong understanding of it, is of extremely realistic educational significance, because the blurring of class struggle viewpoints in our place is not only manifested in the wrong understanding of Wu Xun, but also in other specific issues. For example, the paralysis of thought towards counter-revolutionaries -- class enemies -- and the belief that all counter-revolutionaries can be 'reformed through labor,' that the crimes of counter-revolutionaries can be 'pardoned and treated equally,' that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is not 'democratic,' etc., are in essence concrete manifestations of a blurred class viewpoint that cannot distinguish between enemies and friends."

    The editorial finally called on literary and art workers to examine their own thoughts and improve their work in connection with the discussion and criticism of *The Life of Wu Xun*: "Literary and art workers should learn from the mistakes made by the film *The Life of Wu Xun*, examine their own class stand, class viewpoint, and creative methods in literary and art creation, further clarify the creative thinking of praising positive and active heroic figures, carry out literary and art criticism, and better implement Chairman Mao's literary and art line for workers, peasants, and soldiers. We should overcome those reactionary petty-bourgeois sentimentality in literature and art, the unprincipled peaceful coexistence in literary and art criticism, and those tendencies of being keen on miraculous old things without actively and positively praising new things."

### 批判武训是一课生动具体的马列主义思想教育——东北日报社论摘要

　　批判武训是一课生动具体的马列主义思想教育        
    ——东北日报社论摘要
    东北日报在六月十日发表题为《批判武训是一课生动具体的马列主义思想教育》的社论，号召各级党的组织和文化教育界展开关于武训问题的讨论，通过这次讨论，提高党员和干部的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想水平。
    社论首先指出了东北教育界和文化界思想混乱的严重情况：“前‘东北行政委员会教育部’编审，东北书店一九四九年出版的高中国文教材第三册中，即编选了‘武训先生纪念会上的发言摘录’课文，文中对武训推崇备至，这本教材已在广大教师与学生中散布了有害的影响。旅大师范学校在校门前悬挂武训的画像，还计划修建‘武训亭’，提倡武训办学的‘坚韧精神’。沈阳市文教局曾在优秀文教工作者大会的晚会上特别放映《武训传》影片，以资学习，沈阳市文教局负责同志并曾在北市区第一次人民代表会上以武训精神鼓励群众办学，引起群众盲目崇拜。松江省文教厅出版的《识字通讯》，连载《武训传》连环画，用以推动识字运动。此外，在市场上流传的歌颂武训的书刊，则有《武训画传》、《千古奇丐》、电影小说《武训传》、《武训先生的传记》及关于武训的数种连环图画等等”。
    社论继称：“《武训传》所提出的问题，是一个阶级立场，阶级观点的问题。歌颂封建统治的拥护者武训的反动宣传，能够在包括某些共产党员在内的革命的文化教育工作者中间有它的‘市场’，它不仅未受到批判，而且有的同志还加以推崇和宣扬，这说明了这些同志在关于武训这个问题上，是离开了无产阶级的立场、离开了马克思列宁主义的立场，模糊了历史唯物论和阶级斗争的基本观点。正是由于他们离开了阶级性去观察问题，所以才得出一套错误的结论。模糊了阶级斗争的基本观点，就会在不同程度上为各种不同形式的阶级调和的反动观点所腐蚀，为资产阶级的改良主义思想所腐蚀了，所以重视电影《武训传》的讨论，揭露和肃清对于它的错误认识，是具有极为现实的教育意义，因为阶级斗争观点的模糊在我们这里不仅表现在对武训的错误认识这个问题上，而且也表现在其他的具体问题上。例如对于反革命分子——阶级敌人的麻痹思想和认为一切反革命分子都可以‘劳动改造’，认为反革命分子的罪恶可以‘既往不咎一视同仁’，认为镇压反革命是不‘民主’等等的错误认识，其实质也都是敌我不分、敌友不分的阶级观点模糊的具体表现”。
    社论最后号召文艺工作者联系《武训传》的讨论和批判，检查自己的思想，提高自己的工作：“文艺工作者应该从电影《武训传》所犯的错误中吸取教训，检查自己在文艺创作上的阶级立场、阶级观点，和创作方法上的问题，进一步明确歌颂正面的积极的英雄人物的创作思想，开展文艺批评，更好地贯彻毛主席为工农兵的文艺路线。应克服那些文艺上的反动的小资产阶级温情主义，文艺批评上无原则的和平共居，以及那些热中于奇迹式的旧事物，而不积极地正面地歌颂新生事物的偏向”。
