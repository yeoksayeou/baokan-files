Beijing and Tianjin Students Enrolling in Military Academies in Large Numbers
Both Cities Establish Enrollment Committees for Unified Leadership

[This newspaper’s report] Upon hearing the decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding the enrollment of students for various military cadre schools, students in various schools in Beijing expressed their enthusiastic support. When students at the Affiliated Women's Middle School of the Normal University heard the news about the military school enrollment on the radio on the morning of the 25th, they applauded and cheered, with the third-year junior high school students being particularly excited. Some immediately went around inquiring about the enrollment conditions and procedures. On the same day, each class studied and discussed the decision of the State Council, and the students expressed their determination to respond to the call of the motherland and prepare to apply for various military cadre schools. Many members of the Communist Youth League at Tsinghua University requested to register for military cadre schools with the League branch. Two-thirds of the first-year students in the Economics Department wanted to apply, and more than 20 second-year students in both the Economics Department and the Foreign Languages Department had expressed their determination to enroll. Some students at the Normal University wrote letters to the Communist Youth League Committee of the school, guaranteeing: resolutely respond to the call of the motherland, register for military cadre schools, and unconditionally obey organizational assignments. Students at the Hui Nationality College unanimously requested to delay dinner by half an hour on the 25th to study the decision of the State Council in groups. One student said, "I applied last time but was not approved due to poor health. Now I have improved my health, and I must join a military cadre school."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 26th - Students from major universities and middle schools in Tianjin are responding to the call of the motherland and are actively enrolling in various military cadre schools.

The campus of the private Tsin沽 University Affiliated Middle School was decorated like a festival, with huge banners hanging on the high buildings: "The motherland is calling us, let our youth radiate the light of revolutionary heroism!" On the morning of the 25th, more than 50 people registered at the student union. Chen Tianjian, a student in the third grade of junior high school, had just turned 17 this year. He had applied last time but was not approved, and this time he resolutely applied again. Twenty-three students from the private Tsin沽 University have registered to apply. The faculty and students of the private Yaohua Middle School held a mobilization meeting on the morning of the 25th to participate in military cadre schools. At the meeting, the mother of Chen Dawei, a student who had previously joined a military school, described the situation of her child after joining the military cadre school and said to the meeting: "The motherland loves children more than mothers." She called on everyone to enthusiastically respond to the call of the motherland. On the morning of the 25th, more than ten students from Nankai University submitted their application forms to the student union.
