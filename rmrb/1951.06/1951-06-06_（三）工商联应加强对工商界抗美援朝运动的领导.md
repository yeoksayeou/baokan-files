    (III) The Federation of Industry and Commerce Should Strengthen Leadership Over the Movement of Industry and Commerce to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

    In the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, industrialists and businessmen in various cities, under the promotion of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, have generally received preliminary patriotic education, improved their awareness, and have actively formulated patriotic pacts in connection with their own businesses, and have made many achievements. However, many industrialists and businessmen in various places have not yet received patriotic education; even those who have received education vary greatly in their level of patriotic awareness. In particular, the formulation of patriotic pacts is not yet widespread, and some of those already formulated have not been seriously implemented. Therefore, the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various cities across the country should continue to strengthen their leadership over the movement of industry and commerce to resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in order to consolidate and enhance the patriotic enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial sectors.

    First, it is necessary to earnestly promote the patriotic pact movement based on the Federation's call on June 1st. Those who have not formulated pacts in the past, or who have only formulated common pacts on a regional basis, while individual industries and households have not formulated them, should mobilize industrialists and businessmen to formulate them universally on the basis of consciousness and voluntariness. Those who have formulated them in the past but whose contents are empty and vague should initiate revisions or reformulations. The industrial and commercial sectors in various places, like all other sectors, should incorporate the work of increasing production, donating weapons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers into their patriotic pacts. This is because these two things are the most important practical work to support the Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. In order to ensure that the patriotic pacts of the industrial and commercial sectors can be truly implemented, the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various places should also establish a regular inspection system for patriotic pacts in an organized manner. Some Federations of Industry and Commerce in some cities have not conducted a single inspection since they led everyone to formulate patriotic pacts, and therefore know little or nothing about the implementation of the patriotic pacts. This laissez-faire approach is very harmful and should attract the attention of the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various places.

    Continuing to eliminate the blank spots in the propaganda and education work of Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the industrial and commercial sectors, and gradually establishing and improving regular political study organizations in the industrial and commercial sectors in a planned manner, are also important tasks for the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various cities in the future. In eliminating blank spots, one should not be satisfied with some large lectures or general appeals, but should go deep into various industries, widely convene various small gatherings, and use recollections, comparisons, and accusations to enlighten industrialists and businessmen about their hatred of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and their love for the people's motherland. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce has done a relatively good job in this regard. In the movement against the United States rearming Japan, in mid-March, they organized 74 industries in the city to hold accusation meetings, and some committee members of trade associations visited homes to inquire about grievances, thus launching a large-scale accusation movement. This played a great role in promoting the development of the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in the city's industrial and commercial sectors.

    In strengthening political study, although the industrial and commercial sectors in various places have put forward such slogans in their patriotic pacts, this slogan is still just a slogan in the industrial and commercial sectors in many places. Of course, it is difficult to organize all industrialists and businessmen to study, such as the limitation of time and the low cultural level of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen; but this is not insurmountable. Under the promotion of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, 1,270 households in 83 industries in Datong City, Chahar Province, have participated in study groups. This shows that as long as the Federations of Industry and Commerce in various cities work hard, the political study of the industrial and commercial sectors can be gradually developed.

    （三）工商联应加强对工商界抗美援朝运动的领导
    抗美援朝运动中，各城市的工商业者在工商业联合会的推动下，已经比较普遍地受到了初步的爱国主义教育，提高了自己的觉悟，纷纷联系本身业务订立了爱国公约，而且已经作出了许多成绩。但各地工商业者仍有不少未受到爱国教育；就是已经受到教育的工商业者，爱国觉悟的提高程度也很不一致。特别是爱国公约的订立还不够普遍，已经订立的有的还没有认真执行。因此全国各城市的工商业联合会，应继续加强对工商界抗美援朝运动的领导，以便巩固和提高工商界的爱国积极性。
    首先是要根据本会六月一日的号召认真推行爱国公约运动。过去未订公约，或仅以地区为单位订立了共同公约，而各行业各户尚未订立者，应该发动工商业者在自觉自愿的基础上普遍订立。过去已订立但是内容空泛者，应该发起修订或重订。各地工商界和其他各界一样，都应将增加生产捐献武器以及优待烈属军属的工作，订入爱国公约之内。因为这两件事，是支援抗美援朝的最重要的实际工作。为了使工商界的爱国公约真正能够贯彻执行，各地工商业联合会还应有组织地建立起经常的爱国公约检查制度。有些城市的工商业联合会自从领导大家订立爱国公约后，至今未进行过一次检查，因而对爱国公约的执行情形知道得很少，或完全不知道。这种放任自流的作法是十分有害的，应引起各地工商业联合会的注意。
    继续消灭工商界中的抗美援朝宣传教育工作的空白点，并逐步有计划地建立和健全工商界的经常时事学习组织，也是各城市工商业联合会今后的重要工作。在消灭空白点方面，不应满足于一些大型的讲演报告会或一般的号召，而应该深入到各个行业，广泛召开各种小型集会，用回忆、对比和控诉的方式，来启发工商业者对美帝国主义及国民党反动派的仇恨，和对于人民祖国的热爱。石家庄市工商业联合会在这方面作得比较好。他们在反对美国重新武装日本的运动中，在三月中旬组织了全市七十四个行业召开了控诉会，有些同业公会的委员还挨门访苦，因而掀起了一个大规模的控诉运动。这对于该市工商界抗美援朝运动的开展，起了很大的推动作用。
    在加强时事学习方面，各地工商界虽然都在爱国公约中提出这样的口号，但这个口号在许多地方的工商界中到现在还仅仅是一个口号。当然，要把所有的工商业者组织起来学习，是有困难的，如时间的限制和中小工商业者的文化水平较低等；但这并不是不能克服的。察哈尔大同市工商界在工商联的推动下已有八十三个行业一千二百七十户参加学习组。这就说明，只要各城市的工商业联合会努力工作，工商界的时事学习是能够逐步开展起来的。
