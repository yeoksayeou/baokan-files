    Tour Guides at the Summer Palace and Other Places Should Correctly Explain Historical Events
    (1) Editor:
    Today, at the Summer Palace, I heard a tour guide make extremely erroneous explanations to tourists, such as "Emperor Guangxu was truly a good emperor," and "If Guangxu had been in power, Japan would not have been so rampant and would not have invaded our country." This shows that tour guides' understanding of many historical facts is muddled.
    In order to promote patriotism to the vast number of tourists through scenic spots and historical sites, it is very necessary to rectify and educate tour guides so that they can make correct explanations. The park management authorities should pay close attention to this.
    In addition, the Summer Palace could also, like the exhibition rooms of the Palace Museum, use more written explanations to help tourists understand historical events.

    (2) Editor:
    The Temple of Heaven in Beijing is one of the great creations of the Chinese working people. Regarding the management of the Temple of Heaven, I feel that there are two shortcomings that should be corrected. I am now raising them for the reference of the Temple of Heaven management.
    First, political and historical education for staff should be strengthened. When we visited the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, an elderly man in his fifties who had worked at the Temple of Heaven for thirty years spread superstitious ideas to us, such as saying: "Liu Bowen is a celestial being; if you say he isn't there, he will immediately disappear!" "The emperor is the son of heaven, so of course he must respect heaven," "The emperor is the head of the farmers, so of course he must take the lead in farming," "The construction of Beijing is entirely thanks to the immortal Liu Bowen," and so on. Such erroneous statements are truly intolerable and must be quickly educated and corrected.
    Second, the explanations of cultural relics should be as easy to understand as possible. The explanations of the cultural relics at the Temple of Heaven are generally in classical Chinese; moreover, there are no punctuation marks. I feel that these explanations should all be in vernacular Chinese, and there should be punctuation marks. Whether they are written vertically or horizontally, or from left to right, or from right to left, etc., should also be studied and made uniform. I think other tourist attractions or exhibitions should also pay attention to this point.

### 颐和园等处导游人员应正确解说历史事物

    颐和园等处导游人员应正确解说历史事物
    （一）编辑同志：
    今天我在颐和园听到游览向导人员，向游客作“光绪真是一个好皇帝”，“光绪如能当政，日本就不会这样猖獗，就不至于侵略我国”等等极为错误的解说。从这里可看到导游员对许多历史事实的认识是糊涂的。
    为了通过名胜古迹向广大的游客宣传爱国主义，整顿和教育导游人员，使他们正确地进行解说，是非常必要的，公园的管理机关应很好地注意起来。
    此外，颐和园也可以像故宫博物馆的陈列室那样，多用文字说明来帮助游客认识历史事物。
                        徐勤彬
    （二）编辑同志：
    北京天坛是中国劳动人民的伟大创造之一。在天坛的管理上，我觉得有两个应该改正的缺点，现在提出来供天坛管理方面参考。
    一、应加强对工作人员的政治和历史教育。我们在祈年殿内参观时，有一位五十来岁、在天坛工作了三十年的老人向我们散播迷信思想，如说：“刘伯温是神仙，说没有，马上就不见他老人家了！”，“皇帝是天子，当然要敬天”，“皇帝是农民的头，当然要带头耕地”，“修北京完全是刘伯温仙人的功劳”等等，这样的错误说法，实在令人不能容忍，必须很快得到教育改正。
    二、对文物的解说应力求通俗易懂。天坛的文物解说一般是文言文；而且没有标点符号，我觉得这些解说应一律用白话文，并且应有标点符号，竖写横写或由左向右，由右向左等也都应经过研究作统一规定。这一点，我认为其他的游览处所或展览会也应注意。
