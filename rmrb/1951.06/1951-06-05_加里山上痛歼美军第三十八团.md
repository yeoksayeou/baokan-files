　　Mount Gary is northeast of Hongcheon, with continuous towering mountains and cliffs piercing the clouds, stretching for more than thirty miles, with the main peak reaching over eight hundred meters. On the evening of May 17th, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army annihilated the majority of the US Second Infantry Division's 38th Regiment here.

　　That evening, the enemy on the mountain immediately retaliated blindly with dense fire towards the forward positions of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. The Volunteer Army's infantry bypassed the enemy's artillery fire net and went straight for the ridge of a certain height. Wang Laicheng, the leader of the spearhead squad, and his comrades bravely cut through four barbed wire fences, eliminated layers of minefields, and rushed straight for the ridge. Four American soldiers were just poking their heads out of bunkers by the mountain gully when they were killed in the bunkers by the hand grenades of the Volunteer Army soldiers. Here, the spearhead squad cut a gap in the enemy's defenses on Mount Gary. At this time, the enemy entrenched on the mountaintop had not yet realized that the Volunteer Army had penetrated their depths and were still blindly firing artillery. The deafening artillery fire drowned out the explosions of the hand grenades thrown by the spearhead squad.

　　The Volunteer Army's brave warriors traversed the winding deep valleys between the peaks of Mount Gary with agility. Enemy shells and bullets, leaving trails of red light, streaked over the warriors' heads. The warriors disregarded all this and swiftly plunged forward. Within two hours, they crossed mountains and ridges, penetrating more than thirty miles into the enemy's defenses, and arrived at Dashuidong, the southern entrance of Mount Gary, at twelve o'clock at night. Before the battle began, the warriors who had been eagerly awaiting the battle were afraid that the enemy would escape, but now they were slightly relieved because they had already penetrated the enemy's heart, and the enemy could not escape.

　　The warriors had already traveled thirty or forty miles, soaked in sweat, but they still rushed straight for Dashuidong without stopping. At this time, the officers of the US 38th Regiment headquarters were all fast asleep in tents at Dashuidong, thinking that the sound of artillery fire was still far away and that the Volunteer Army would be unable to break through under their fierce artillery blockade. Only when hand grenades were thrown into the tents did these fellows慌慌张张 (huāng huāng zhāng zhāng - in a flustered manner) put on their clothes and trousers, climb up, and use cars as fortifications for a hasty defense. Only then did the enemy realize the divine soldiers from the sky. The gunfire from the enemy on the mountain and in the valleys weaved a red curtain of fire.

　　At this time, the Volunteer Army's warriors had already penetrated into the enemy's heartland. Yan Chaolu, the platoon leader of the spearhead platoon, led three warriors into the midst of more than two hundred enemies, using three submachine guns to knock the enemies down. Then, several more warriors plunged in to fight. The enemy, relying on their numbers, surrounded these few warriors and wrestled with them. Cui Jianguo, the second platoon leader of the ninth company, fought alone against four American soldiers. His backpack was torn to shreds by the enemy's bayonets. When the enemy pounced again, he took the opportunity to seize a carbine, rolled four or five steps away on the spot, turned around and shot all four American soldiers dead. Zhang Mingneng, a small artillery gunner, killed two American soldiers with a spade in one breath. In a melee, the enemy was frightened and scrambled into bunkers and under cars.

　　While the melee near the enemy's regimental headquarters was in progress, another Volunteer Army unit cut off the highway leading south from Dashuidong. Li Yongfu, who was at the front, destroyed the first enemy car attempting to break through, thus blocking more than a hundred cars and armored vehicles behind it in the mountains. Machine gunner Li Qingsong set two armored vehicles on fire. The shells on the vehicles exploded continuously, blasting the American soldiers into a bloody mess. American soldiers' corpses were everywhere on cars, in tents, and in bunkers. American officers relying on cars as fortifications were also killed next to the cars, and more than a hundred enemy troops were captured. The American troops on the entire Mount Gary were like a swarm of hornets whose nests had been overturned. Those on the mountaintop rolled down the mountain, and those in the gullies climbed up the mountaintop. The radios had been abandoned on the mountain, and the chemical mortars were neatly set up there, but the artillerymen had disappeared.

　　Another fraternal unit pressed down from the front of Mount Gary at this time, and the two heroic units fought on the summit and at the foot of Mount Gary. Ding Dexue, the ninth squad leader of the third company, led three warriors to capture five mountaintops in a row. Li Qingsong, a machine gunner, killed more than eighty enemies with one machine gun. Bai Meitang, a lone hero, captured two enemy bunkers in a row and captured twelve American soldiers alive. Communicators, medics, and cooks also organized a team of thirty-eight people, using six rifles to repel more than a hundred fleeing enemies, killing more than twenty and capturing six alive. The battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the US 38th Regiment was wounded in a gully near Dashuidong. An enemy helicopter flew low, attempting to land and rescue him, but it was quickly shot down at the foot of the mountain by our heavy machine gunner. The wounded American battalion commander was also captured alive.

　　After a night of fighting, nearly a thousand American corpses lay scattered on Mount Gary, and another two hundred and fifty-eight American officers and soldiers were taken prisoner. The entire First and Second Battalions of the US Second Infantry Division's 38th Regiment, the majority of the Third Battalion, and the regimental headquarters were thus annihilated on Mount Gary.

　　During the day of May 18th, the heroes also defeated the counterattacks of the US Second Infantry Division's reinforcements and a part of the puppet army. Platoon leader Shi Dengying and his twelve comrades defended a mountaintop, repelling twelve assaults by an enemy battalion without any casualties. When the enemy was charging up, machine gun squad leader Lang Yucai was shot in the left leg. He gritted his teeth, knelt in the pool of blood, and continued to fire until he repelled an attack by an enemy company before he bandaged his wound. Under the slogan "Win glory for the motherland," the warriors stood firm on Mount Gary. Mount Gary was like a sharp knife, splitting the enemy on the east and west sides in half, making it impossible for the puppet army to flee west or for the American army to reinforce east. The heroes who occupied Mount Gary killed and wounded a large number of enemies and also powerfully supported the fraternal units on the eastern route in annihilating the Li puppet army.

　　加里山上痛歼美军第三十八团
    新华社记者  王玉章
    加里山在洪川东北，丛山峻岭绵延起伏，峭壁奇峰高插云霄，纵横达三十余里，主峰高达八百多公尺。五月十七日晚，志愿军某部在这里将美军第二师第三十八团大部歼灭了。
    这一天的黄昏，山头上的敌人立即以密集的火力向志愿军某部的正面阵地盲目还击。志愿军的步兵部队绕过敌炮火网，直逼某高地的山脊。尖刀班班长王来成和他的战友们勇猛地斩断了四道铁丝网，破除了层层的地雷阵，直扑山脊。四个美国兵正从山沟边的地堡里探头向外望，就被志愿军战士的手榴弹打死在地堡里。尖刀班在这里把加里山敌人的防线劈开了一道缺口。这时据守在山头上的敌人还没有发觉志愿军已插入了他们的纵深，还在盲目地乱打炮，震耳的炮声把尖刀班扔出的手榴弹的爆炸声也掩没了。
    志愿军的勇士们矫健地穿行在加里山诸峰之间的曲折的深谷中。敌人的炮弹、枪弹拖着一条条的红光，在勇士们头顶上飞掠而过。勇士们也不顾这一切，迅速地向前猛插。两个钟头内，他们翻山越岭，插进敌人防线三十多里，在夜晚十二时，到了加里山的南口大水洞。战斗开始前，日夜盼望着战斗的勇士们惟恐敌人逃跑了，现在他们才稍为放心，因为已经插进了敌人的心脏，敌人逃不掉了。
    勇士们已经走了三四十里，混身淌着汗水，但他们仍毫不停息地直扑大水洞。这时美军第三十八团团部的军官们都在大水洞的帐篷里睡大觉，他们满以为炮声还远，而且以为在他们猛烈炮火的封锁下志愿军是无法攻入的。当手榴弹打进了帐篷的时候，这些家伙才慌慌张张地穿衣提裤，爬了起来，用汽车当工事，仓猝应战。敌人到这时才发觉了我军这支从天而降的神兵，山上山下的敌人发射的枪炮弹织成了一片火红的弹幕。
    这时我军勇士们已经插入敌人的心脏地带。尖刀排排长阎朝卢带着三个勇士插进两百多敌人里面，用三支冲锋枪打得敌人倒地。接着又有几个勇士插进来厮杀。敌人仗恃人多，就围住这几位勇士扭打起来。九连第二排排长崔建国独战四个美国兵。他的背包被敌人刺刀戳得稀烂。当敌人再次扑上来时，他趁势夺下一支卡宾枪，就地滚出四、五步远，转过头来将四个美国兵都打死了。小炮炮手张明能用洋锹一气砍死两个美国兵。一场混战，敌人被打怕了，纷纷往地堡里和汽车下面乱钻。
    敌人的团部附近的混战正在进行的时候，志愿军另部又截断了大水洞通往南方的公路，冲在最前面的李永福迎头把敌人企图突围的第一辆汽车击毁，这样就把后面的百余辆汽车和装甲车堵在山里了。机枪射手李清松将两辆装甲车打得燃烧起来，车上的炮弹连续爆炸，把美国兵炸得血肉横飞。汽车上，帐篷里，地堡里，到处是美军死尸，凭借着汽车当工事的美军军官也被打死在车旁，一百多个敌军被俘掳。整个加里山上的美军像一群戳翻了窝的黄蜂，山顶上的往山下滚，山沟里的又往山顶上爬，报话机已被丢弃在山上，化学迫击炮完好地架在那里，炮手们已不知去向。
    另一支兄弟部队这时从加里山正面压下来了，两支英雄部队奔杀在加里山的山顶和山下。三连九班长丁德学带着三个勇士连夺五个山头。机枪射手李清松的一挺机枪又打死敌人八十多名。独胆英雄白美堂一个人连夺两个敌堡，活捉十二个美国兵。通讯员、卫生员、炊事员们也组织了一支三十八个人的队伍，用六支步枪迎击一百多溃敌，打死了二十多名，活捉了六名。美军第三十八团第二营营长在大水洞旁的山沟里被打伤。敌人的一架直升飞机低飞而来，企图降落把他救走，但很快就被我重机枪射手击落在山下。那个负了伤的美军营长也被活捉了。
    经过彻夜的战斗，加里山上横七竖八摆着近千具美军尸体，另有二百五十八个美军官兵当了俘虏。美军第二师第三十八团的第一、第二两营的全部，第三营和该团团部的大部，就这样被歼灭在加里山上。
    五月十八日白天，英雄们又击溃了美军第二师增援部队和伪军一部的反扑。排长史登英和他的十二个战友踞守在一座山头上，打垮了一个营敌人的十二次冲锋，而自己无一伤亡。在敌人往上冲的时候，机枪班长郎玉才左腿中弹，他咬着牙跪在血泊中继续发射，直到打垮了敌人一个连的进攻，他才包扎伤口。勇士们在“为祖国争光”的口号下，雄踞在加里山上。加里山像一把尖刀似的将东西两面的敌人劈成两半，使伪军西逃不得，美军东援不成。攻占加里山的英雄们杀伤了大量的敌人，而且还有力地支援了东路兄弟部队聚歼李伪军。
