Taking responsibility for completing the transportation plan approved by the Ministry of Railways as the primary task. 2. Having independent economic power in the process of implementing production and financial plans. 3. Implementing independent accounting, independently calculating profits and losses, and enjoying legal person status; having the right to use the administration's fixed assets and to allocate the administration's working capital; having the right to obtain short-term loans from the National Bank and to sign contracts or agreements with other enterprises or institutions; but bearing all material responsibility for fulfilling contracts, agreements, and other obligations. 4. Fully utilizing reserve forces and maximizing their potential to ensure the completion or over-completion of planned production tasks, reduce consumption, lower transportation costs, and increase capital accumulation, in order to accelerate the development of the railway industry. Regarding the evaluation of the work performance of railways, the Ministry of Railways stipulates that it should not only be based on the completed production workload, but also focus on the results of its financial work.

    Over the past year, the national railways have made many preparations for the implementation of the economic accounting system. Such as the preparation of a unified production and financial plan, the inventory of warehouse materials, the unification of railway treasuries, the improvement and unification of the railway accounting system and statistical system, and the determination of various work standards. Therefore, the implementation of the economic accounting system for railway administrations from July is timely and has its material basis.

　　铁道部决定自七月一日起全国各铁路管理局实行经济核算制度
    中央人民政府铁道部决定全国各铁路管理局自七月一日起，实行经济核算制度。
    铁道部规定实行经济核算制以后，各管理局的权限与责任是：一、以负责完成铁道部核定的运输计划为主要任务。二、在执行生产及财务计划过程中有独立运用经济权。三、实行会计独立，单独计算盈亏，享有法人权；具有运用本局固定资金及支配本局流动资金之权；具有向国家银行举借短期贷款及与其他企业或机关签订合同或协定之权；但对于履行合同、协定及其他应负担之义务，负物质上之一切责任。四、应充分利用储备力量，并尽量发挥其潜在能力，以保证完成或超额完成计划生产任务，减少消费，降低运输成本，增加资金积累，以期加速铁路事业之发展。关于铁路工作成绩的评定，铁道部规定不仅以其完成的生产工作量为准，并应着重于其财务工作的结果。
    一年多以来，全国铁路已作了许多实行经济核算制的准备工作。如编制了统一的生产及财务计划，清查了仓库物资，统一了铁路金库，改进和统一了铁路会计制度与统计制度，查定了各种工作标准等。因此，自七月份起实行管理局的经济核算制度，是适时的，并有其物质基础的。
