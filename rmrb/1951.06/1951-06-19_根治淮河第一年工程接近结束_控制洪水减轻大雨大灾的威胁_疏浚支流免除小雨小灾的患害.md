　　The first year of the comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River is nearing completion. The 2.2 million-strong labor force participating in the comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River has completed nearly 200 million cubic meters of earthwork in approximately 100 workdays of winter and spring repairs. This massive amount of earthwork, if used to build a wall one meter high and one meter wide, would be 200,000 kilometers long, nearly five times the circumference of the Earth (the Earth's circumference is 40,007 kilometers). To complete this great project, the Central People's Government allocated 1 billion catties of grain for Huai River harnessing and transferred more than 20,000 staff members and expert technicians from all over the country to serve the cause.

　　The first year's project of the comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River is aimed at the Huai River's ailments of "large and rapid flood peaks, small riverbeds, and silted-up inner rivers," and is based on the principles of "controlling flood volume, reducing flood peaks, and lowering ground and underground water levels." In terms of construction steps, the focus is on retaining floodwaters, while also improving river channels and coordinating with mass-based water conservancy construction. First, in the upstream mountainous areas of the Huai River's largest tributaries, the Hong River, Ying River, and Ru River, three valley reservoirs (i.e., the Shimantan, Baisha, and Banqiao Reservoirs) are being built to store 347 million cubic meters of water. Since the spring repairs, all three reservoirs have been under full construction, and the Shimantan Reservoir is expected to be completed before the flood season of the Hong River. As the valley reservoirs can currently only control a portion of the flood volume (reservoir construction will continue next year to achieve large-scale flood control), four depressions, namely Laowangpo, Wu Song Lake, Jiaoting Lake, and Tong Lake, have been built to store 430 million cubic meters of floodwater. This flood storage project was completed by the end of May. Including the natural flood storage capacity of the depressions, a total of approximately 2 billion cubic meters of floodwater can be stored. To coordinate with the flood storage project, partial dredging of river channels has also been carried out on the Ying River, Hong River, and Ru River. After the implementation of the above projects – especially after the storage of 2 billion cubic meters of floodwater – approximately 3.8 million mu of farmland on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Huai River can be protected from disasters, while also reducing flood peaks in the middle reaches and reducing the threat of disasters to some farmland in the middle and lower reaches.

　　However, storing 2 billion cubic meters of floodwater in the upper reaches of the Huai River can only control a portion of the Huai River's highest flood volume. To control floods on a large scale, flood storage projects have also been carried out in the middle reaches. This involves using a series of Meng River depressions above Zhengyangguan, the Run River and Gu River depressions, the Chengxi Lake and Chengdong Lake in Huoqiu County, and the Jiangjia Lake, Tangduo Lake, and Mengjia Lake, etc., to store 7.27 billion cubic meters of floodwater. A diversion gate is also being built at Runheji as a basic control mechanism. In this way, the flood volume of the Huai River main stream after merging with the Ying River below Zhengyangguan can be reduced from a maximum of 13,000 cubic meters per second to 6,500 cubic meters per second, reducing the threat of floods to the river embankments below Zhengyangguan. The earthwork project of 14 million cubic meters related to embankment construction in this great flood storage project was completed by the end of May. The diversion gate project is also expected to be completed before the flood season of the Huai River. After the completion of the flood control and storage projects in the middle and upper reaches, more than 40 million mu of farmland in the northern Anhui region of the middle reaches of the Huai River and the northern Jiangsu region of the lower reaches can be protected from floods.

　　To coordinate with the flood storage project, preliminary dredging projects have also been carried out on the Sui River and the Xifei River, tributaries of the Huai River in the middle reaches. The former has completed 27 million cubic meters of earthwork, and the latter has completed 14.16 million cubic meters of earthwork. The river mouths of the Dongfei River, Yao River, and Qian River have also been preliminarily dredged. After the implementation of these projects, approximately 10 million mu of farmland in the northern Anhui region of the middle reaches of the Huai River can be protected from waterlogging disasters.

　　After flood storage is carried out in the upper and middle reaches, a flow of 8,500 cubic meters per second still needs to be discharged in the lower reaches. For this reason, the Grand Canal embankments have been vigorously reinforced. The revetment stonework on the east embankment of the Grand Canal and the lakeside revetment stone embankment on the west embankment, totaling 100,000 cubic meters of stone, were completed by the end of May. The stone revetment project on the top of the west embankment will strive to be completed by the end of June.

　　Based on the above construction situation, the first year of the comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River has two major characteristics: First, it starts from controlling the floods in the upper reaches of the Huai River, truly achieving fundamental governance. This is fundamentally different from the past Kuomintang government's passive Huai River management, which simply sought a way out for floods in the lower reaches – in fact, this was just empty talk and no real action was taken. Second, the projects in the upper, middle, and lower reaches truly achieve overall planning and consideration, mutual care and cooperation, and comprehensive consideration of the interests of all parties. This is only possible in the era of the People's Government. The greatest achievement of the first year of the comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River is that the preliminary dredging of the main tributaries has facilitated rainwater drainage, eliminating the danger of minor rains and minor disasters, and ensuring this year's wheat harvest on both sides of the Huai River. Because a large amount of floodwater has been controlled in the upper reaches of the Huai River, reducing the threat of floods to the main and tributary streams, the degree of damage from major rains and major disasters can also be reduced in the future.

　　根治淮河第一年工程接近结束
　  控制洪水减轻大雨大灾的威胁   
    疏浚支流免除小雨小灾的患害
    参加根治淮河的二百二十万劳动大军，大约一百个工作日的冬修、春修工程中，已完成治淮第一年度施工总任务近二亿公方。这一巨大的土方数量，如果筑成高、宽各一公尺的土墙，有二十万公里长，可环绕地球将近五周（地球一周四万零七千公里）。中央人民政府为了完成这一伟大的工程，曾拨出治淮经费十亿斤粮食；并从全国各地抽调工作人员和专家技术人员二万余人，为治淮服务。
    根治淮河第一年度的工程，是针对淮河“洪峰大而猛，河床小，内河淤”的病源，根据“控制洪水量，剪去洪水峰，降低地面与地下水位”的原则进行的。在施工步骤上，以拦蓄洪水为主，同时整理河槽，并配合群众性的水利建设。首先在淮河上游最大的支流洪河、颍河、汝河的上源山谷地区，兴建三座山谷水库（即石漫滩、白沙、板桥水库），蓄水三亿四千七百万立方公尺。春修以来，三个水库已经全面动工，石漫滩水库在洪河汛期前可全部完工。由于目前山谷水库还只能控制一部分洪水量（明年将继续修建水库，达到大量控制洪水量），因此又在老王坡、吴宋湖、蛟停湖、潼湖四处洼地，修筑了蓄洪四亿三千万立方公尺的工程。这一蓄洪工程已于五月底全部完工。加上利用洼地的自然蓄洪量，共可蓄洪约二十亿立方公尺。为了配合蓄洪工程，又在颍河、洪河、汝河等河道进行了局部疏浚工程。上述工程实施后——特别是蓄洪二十亿立方公尺之后——淮河上游南岸约有三百八十余万亩农田可不致受灾，同时可以降低中游一部分洪水峰，减少中、下游一部分农田被灾的威胁。
    但是，在淮河上游蓄洪二十亿立方公尺，只能控制淮河最高洪水量的一部分。为了大量控制洪水，又在中游进行了蓄洪工程。这就是利用正阳关以上一连串的濛河洼地、润河、谷河洼地，霍邱县的城西湖与城东湖、及姜家湖、唐垛湖、孟家湖等湖泊洼地，蓄洪七十二亿七千万立方公尺；并于润河集建筑分水闸一座，作为基本的控制机关。这样，淮河主流从正阳关以下与颍河合流后，其洪水量可从最高每秒一万三千立方公尺降到每秒六千五百立方公尺，减轻洪水对正阳关以下河堤的威胁。这一伟大蓄洪工程中属于堤工方面的一千四百万公方的土方工程，已于五月底全部完工。分水闸工程，亦将于淮水汛期前完成。中、上游控制洪水的蓄洪工程完工后，淮河中游皖北区及下游苏北区共四千余万亩农田可免受水灾。
    为配合蓄洪工程的进行，又在淮河中游，进行了淮河支流的濉河与西淝河的初步疏浚工程。前者已完成土方二千七百万公方，后者已完成土方一千四百十六万公方。东淝河、窑河、芡河等河口也已初步疏通。这些工程实施后，淮河中游皖北区约千余万亩农田，可免除内涝灾害。
    上中游进行蓄洪后，尚有八千五百秒立方公尺流量须在下游排泄。为此，又大力培修了运河河堤。运河东堤的护坡石工与西堤临湖护坡石岸共十万石方，已于五月底完工。西堤顶的石埝工程将争取六月底完工。
    根据以上施工情况，根治淮河第一年度有两大特点：第一，是从控制淮河上源的洪水入手，真正做到从根本治理。这和过去国民党政府单纯从下游给洪水找出路的消极治淮——其实就这也是空喊，并未真正动手——是根本不同的。第二，上中下游的工程真正做到统筹兼顾，互相照顾，互相配合，全面考虑各方面的利益。这只有在人民政府时代才有可能。根治淮河第一年度的最大收获是：由于各主要支流进行了初步疏浚，便于雨水排泄，小雨小灾的危险已经消除，确保了今年淮河两岸的麦收。由于在淮河上源控制了大量的洪水，减轻了洪水对干支流的威胁，今后大雨大灾的灾害程度亦能减轻。
