Opinions Suspecting the Criticism of Wu Xun and the Film "The Life of Wu Xun"

Editor's Note: After publishing the editorial "Attention Should Be Paid to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," we received many manuscripts and letters from readers, proving that the discussion of this issue is indeed of great significance to the current ideological circles. Among the readers' letters, we have selected a portion of representative ones for publication in this column. What is published today is a portion expressing disagreement or suspicion with the editorial of this newspaper. We believe that since the purpose of the discussion of the Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun" issues is to resolve ideological problems, the method of developing debate and pursuing truth should be adopted, and all different opinions should have the opportunity to be understood by the debaters; therefore, we have decided to publish these letters here to facilitate the development and deepening of the discussion. We hope readers will pay attention.

"Wu Xun is Not a Historical Criminal"

Comrade Editor:

The People's Daily has published many reviews and discussions about "The Life of Wu Xun." Everyone has commented on whether Wu Xun is worthy of emulation. He lived during the era of the vigorous peasant revolution of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but not only did he not play a role in promoting the revolution, but he also eased class struggle, paralyzed people's thoughts, and hindered the revolution.

Wu Xun cannot be like Lü Bu of "Shooting the Halberd at the Gate," who could play a pivotal role at a certain time, so I think Wu Xun is being praised too highly.

Wu Xun has been dead for more than a hundred years, and we have no way of knowing his intentions at the time. Were his bones made of steel? "A punch costs two coins, a kick costs three coins." He knelt in the temple fair and shouted: "Come hit me! Come kick me! For poor children, for building free schools."

The problem lies here. Was Wu Xun acting subserviently for his own benefit, or perhaps with the aim of seeking personal gain? In the past, Wei Qing was a pig-herding slave, and Han Xin endured the humiliation of crawling between someone's legs. What were they doing it for? If it wasn't for their own interests, then our evaluation of historical figures should be more objective.

Wu Xun was neither a descendant of an official family nor a member of the scholar-official class. As the saying goes, "Without climbing high mountains, one does not know the height of the sky." How could he have such a broad vision! Revolution in that era of reactionary rule was called "rebellion." Did he have that courage?

The idea that Wu Xun was born an shameless lackey, a cheapskate... I don't think such a statement is very good. The reactionaries praised him as a "model for all teachers," and the film depicts him as so lofty and great. This should be the responsibility of later generations, the responsibility of writers. To treat fish eyes as jewels, Wu Xun probably didn't have such a will when he died!

Is Wu Xun a historical criminal? My personal understanding is no. Is Wu Xun a national hero? Even less so. He is not worth our praising, nor should he be dismissed as worthless.

"There Are Still Several Questions in My Mind"

Comrade Editor:

Since the publication of "Wu Xun is Not Worth Emulating," I have begun to have a preliminary understanding of Wu Xun as a henchman of the ruling class. However, there are still several questions below, please answer them:

1.  Wu Xun's establishment of free schools undoubtedly created a batch of rulers, large and small, for the Qing Dynasty. This is why he was opposed and spurned by the people. However, should all those who "established schools" in the history of feudal society or during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries be rejected?! Are none of them worth praising? Then, how should we understand Yan Fansun and Zhang Boling of Tianjin? Why did the Xinhua News Agency, in its news report after Zhang Boling's death, still say that he had "made contributions" to education?

2.  In the old society, many people subjectively wished to "popularize education," but the people they cultivated served the ruling class, whether directly or indirectly. Take Mr. Tao Xingzhi as an example. He was a revolutionary educator, but before the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, wasn't its objective effect beneficial to the enemy? Even if he educated many people to participate in the revolution. If I come to such a conclusion: "Only after the people are in power can education serve the people." Is this correct? But if there had been no "education" before, how could so many revolutionary workers have emerged? (My thinking may be a bit confused.)

3.  Naturally, Wu Xun would not have emerged today, but we still encourage "establishing schools." This is because it is beneficial to the people! If a person also donates money to establish schools in the old society and also donates money to establish schools today, how should we treat him? Didn't he also more or less play a role in helping the reactionary rule in the past?

Different Understandings of Wu Xun

Comrade Editor:

We have three opinions in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun." We don't know which one is correct?

(1) Wu Xun is counter-revolutionary.

(2) Wu Xun is revolutionary, but he took the wrong path because of different circumstances.

(3) Wu Xun has revolutionary parts and also counter-revolutionary parts. Especially later, he completely degenerated into a counter-revolutionary.

How should we understand it correctly? Please reply.

孙星燃 [Sun Xingran]

Comrade Editor:

After reading the comments of comrades Yang Er and Deng Youmei on Wu Xun in the People's Daily on May 16, we have gained a further understanding of Wu Xun's so-called "outstanding spirit." Wu Xun suffered all his life, but he had no clear struggle goals, no deep understanding of the reasons for the poverty of the peasants, and he did not understand why the peasants did not have the opportunity to receive education. On the contrary, he bowed and scraped to the ruling class who created these phenomena and eroded the will of the peasants to struggle. After展开讨论 [zhǎn kāi tǎo lùn –展开讨论 literally means "unfolding a discussion" but is used to refer to people engaging in a deeper level of discussion] discussion, we believe that Wu Xun's behavior really did not promote the progress of Chinese history or promote the forward development of the social economy. But we feel there are several questions below:

(1) Is Wu Xun's starting point for poor people to receive education still correct? Was he thinking of personal fame and honor such as being granted a title for righteous education?

(2) Is Wu Xun's spirit of hard work and endurance worth learning?

(3) What was the actual situation of the Shandong people's armed resistance against the rulers at the time when Wu Xun established schools? Who led it? What was the result?

Please explain the above points so that we can展开讨论 [zhǎn kāi tǎo lùn –展开讨论 literally means "unfolding a discussion" but is used to refer to people engaging in a deeper level of discussion] further.

王家齐 [Wang Jiaqi]

"Wu Xun Should Have a Certain Evaluation"

Comrade Editor:

After reading Jia Ji's "Wu Xun is Not Worth Emulating," I feel that there are many unique insights, and at the same time, I have a point of view that I would like to raise for discussion.

(1) Begging for education is an accidental event and also a commendable event. We cannot deny everything because of fabrications or rashness in the film.

First of all, in the more than two thousand years of feudal society, there were definitely more than just Wu Xun who had the same or similar experiences as Wu Xun, but there was indeed no second person who begged for education. At the same time, in the long journey of establishing schools, he encountered many difficulties, and never felt discouraged or disheartened. When this kind of perseverance is combined with establishing schools, it seems that there is nothing wrong with it. As for whether in the process of establishing schools, it was really as shown in the film: "A punch, two coins; a kick, three coins." Before accurate investigation, a question mark needs to be placed?

Secondly, Wu Xun was definitely not the only one who understood the benefits of reading from his mother since childhood; nor was Wu Xun the only one whose life experience deepened his desire for literacy. Why was Wu Xun the only one who begged for education? Without discarding "altruism of self-sacrifice," it is probably not easy to find a better source of great energy. This cannot be said to be a strange and commendable event in the feudal society where "man is for himself, and heaven punishes him." As for the myth of "great enlightenment only after a three-day, three-night dreamlike journey to hell," it is probably a fabricated interlude by the editor.

(2) From the perspective of effect and motivation, we can only say that this is a typical tragedy. It seems that we should not have too high demands or blame on Wu Xun, who grew up in a typical rural area.

In order to solve the big problem of "poor people not being bullied," focusing solely on literacy cannot find the law of historical development, and as a result, he took a cold attitude towards the great Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. As a result, although the goal of establishing schools was achieved, he still could not jump out of the old circle of "Three Cardinal Guides and Five Constant Virtues" and gradually moved towards helping the ruling class, assisting them, and even becoming their accomplices. This cannot but be said to be a great tragedy that goes against one's wishes! I think that in China's long feudal society, there are probably more than just Wu Xun buried in similar tragedies. As for the contact between Wu Xun and Zhou Da shown in the film, judging from the actions of both parties, it is probably an interlude within an interlude or a rash explanation. If we demand that Wu Xun, who grew up in a typical feudal rural area, make a super-historical leap, it seems to be too high or too harsh.

It is a fact that literacy is Wu Xun's subjective wish, not the main demand in the lives of the vast peasants. However, we cannot deny everything because of "indifference to literacy." Not to mention the distant past, let's talk about it since liberation. Although the demand for literacy in rural areas where land reform has been completed is more urgent than before, it still requires the government or mass organizations to spend a lot of effort in running schools or literacy classes. I think the reason why the masses do not have the same desire for literacy as Wu Xun is the problem of life, which is certainly an important factor; but the historical poison of the long-term policy of "the people can be made to follow, but not to know" may not have a trace of mischief.

In China's social development, how much negative and positive effect does the "learning" of begging for education have? It is necessary to organize a group to go to the current Tangyi County to investigate. We cannot deny the later achievements because of the initial "those who excel in learning will become officials"; nor can we beautify the previous shortcomings or mistakes because of the later achievements.

(3) Wu Xun should have a certain evaluation, and we cannot deny everything from the film. Therefore, Wu Xun needs to be written about, but it needs to be investigated and arranged accurately, and all fabrications or rashness must be removed. At the very least, pay attention to the following facts.

First, China after the emergence of the proletariat has jumped out of the old circle of "one rule and one chaos." After a tortuous road, not only has the fact that Wu Xun dreamed of "poor people not being bullied" appeared, but also the society in which the working masses, which Wu Xun did not dream of, have become the masters of their own affairs is growing day by day. From this, it can be explained: the truth that the peasant revolution cannot be separated from the leadership of the proletariat.

Second, although the study of begging for education is used by the rulers as an accomplice, it is always hopeless or hitting walls everywhere in turbulent times. Only during the great War of Resistance Against Japan, after contacting the Communist Party, did it gain considerable development and was full of bright prospects. This vivid fact must not be missing, and it should be greatly publicized in the film.

Third, from Wu Xun's path, it shows how deeply old ideological consciousness harms people and exposes the hypocritical masks of the rulers' running schools, etc. At the same time, in contrast, it illustrates the importance of eradicating old ideas and establishing new ideas, and critically accepts Wu Xun's altruism of self-sacrifice and the tenacious spirit of not being afraid of difficulties.

"Wu Xun's Establishment of Righteous Schools, the Intention is Not Incorrect"

Dear Chief Writer:

Yesterday I read the chapter on Wu Xun's Biography in the newspaper, and I would also like to express my opinion for correction. I often expressed my grievances in the Qunqiang Daily and Guoqiang Daily during the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China, and I have not spoken on the newspapers for decades. Because it does not conform to the trend, I have to take care of myself alone. Forced by the environment, I did not have the courage to revolt. A careful examination of newspapers, leaflets, books, etc., are all the most powerful propaganda products. Since Kang Youwei and others ran newspapers, up to now, the great effect of true and false, evil and righteous is difficult to enumerate. All those who read books and newspapers should carefully study their purpose. Ancient books should not be underestimated, and the books of Confucius and Mencius should not be swept away, but their meaning should be carefully considered, and those who are good should be followed, and those who are not good should be changed. For example, rhinoceros horns and antelope horns in medicine are valuable items. If used properly, they can bring the dead back to life; if someone eats a pound at a time, not only can it not cure the disease, but it will also die. If you do not investigate the improper use, but say it is a poison, is this right or wrong? Everyone knows that beef and eggs are health products. If a person eats ten pounds of beef and a hundred eggs and is stuffed to death, if he does not know that the use is improper, but says that everyone should not eat them, is this correct? Wu Xun only knew that he was illiterate, had no money to study, and suffered all kinds of pain. He wanted people to be literate, to write and calculate conveniently, and not to be troubled by illiteracy. Establishing righteous schools is for the vast majority of people to study, and the intention is not incorrect. Wu Xun is illiterate, what does he know about exploitation? What is the bourgeoisie? What is revolution? What does it mean to be unyielding in the face of power and wealth? His establishment of righteous schools for the masses to be literate is acceptable and recorded; his servile behavior is unacceptable! I hope that your newspaper will first study its purpose when publishing such matters. Praise should not be exaggerated, criticism should not be researched and speculated, and good roads should not be blocked. You must know that when a newspaper is published, it is seen by thousands of eyes, and history can be passed down for many years. How can you not be cautious?

Because I have not written for many years, the sentences are mostly awkward, and there are many mistakes in the words. I am not afraid to be presumptuous, please correct me! Much to say, much to say.

    怀疑对武训和《武训传》批评的意见
    编者按：在发表了“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”的社论以后，我们接到很多读者的稿件和信件，证明这个问题的讨论，对于目前的思想界确有重要的意义。在读者来信中，我们已经选了一部分有代表性的在本栏发表。今天所发表的，是一部分对本报社论表示异议或怀疑的。我们认为，武训和《武训传》问题的讨论，目的既然在于解决思想问题，就应当采取发展争论追求真理的方法，就应当使各种不同的意见都有被讨论者了解的机会；所以我们决定把这些信件发表在这里，以利于讨论的开展和深入。希望读者加以注意。
    “武训不是历史罪人”编辑同志：
    人民日报发表了很多有关《武训传》的评述和讨论，武训是否足以为训，大家都说过。他生长在轰轰烈烈农民革命的太平天国时代，不但没有起了对革命的推动作用，反而缓和阶级斗争，麻痹人民思想，对革命起阻碍作用。
    武训不能象“辕门射戟”的吕奉先可以在一时起举足轻重的作用，所以我认为把武训捧的过高。
    武训死了一百多年了，我们无法了解他当时的居心为何。他的骨头是不是钢铁铸成的，“打一下两个钱，踢一下三个钱”。他跪在庙集上喊：“来打吧！来踢吧！为了穷孩子，为了修义学。”
    问题就在这儿，武训是不是为自己利益，而奴颜婢膝，或许有利禄功名的企图呢？昔卫青为牧猪之奴，韩信受跨下之辱，所为何来？如果不是为了自己利益出发，那么我们对于历史人物的评价就应该客观些。
    武训既不是宦门后代，也不是士大夫之流。所谓“不登高山即不知天之高也”，他那里有那么大的眼光呢！革命在当时反动统治下的名称是“造反”，他有这个勇气吗？
    武训就是生成的无耻奴才，贱骨头……，我认为这样的说法不太好。反动派把他捧为“万人师表”，电影把他描写的那么崇高伟大，这应该是后世人的责任，写作人的责任。把鱼的眼睛当珠宝看待，武训死时大概没有这样的遗嘱吧！
    武训是不是历史罪人？我个人的认识，不是。武训是不是民族伟人？更不是。他不值我们歌颂，也不该评的一文不值。
                                                        弃名
    “我心里还存在着几个问题”编辑同志：
    自《不足为训的武训》一文发表以来，我开始对武训这样一个统治阶级的帮凶有了初步认识。可是还存在着下面几个问题，请予解答：
    一、武训的兴义学，毫无问题的是给满清皇朝制造了一批大大小小的统治者，这便是他所以要被人民反对与唾弃的原因。可是，在封建社会或国民党反动派统治时期的历史上一切“兴学”的人都要不得了吗？！都不足表扬吗？那末，我们应怎样认识天津的严范孙和张伯苓呢？为什么在张伯苓死后，新华社所发的消息中还说他对于教育事业曾经“有所贡献”呢？
    二、在旧社会里，有很多人在主观愿望上是为了“普及教育”的，然而所造就出来的人却为统治阶级服务。不论是直接的或间接的。就以陶行知先生而论，他是革命的教育工作者，但在中国人民的解放战争未胜利以前，是不是它的客观效果有利于敌人呢？纵使他教育了许多人参加革命。如果我得这样一个结论：“只有在人民掌政之后，教育才能为人民服务。”是不是正确呢？但是如果没有从前的“教育”，又怎能有很多革命工作者出现呢？（我的思想可能混乱一点。）
    三、自然，武训是不会产生于今日的，但是我们还是奖励“兴学”的。这是因为它有利于人民的缘故吧！如果一个人在旧社会也捐款兴学，在今日也捐款兴学，我们将如何对待他呢？他过去不是也或多或少的起了帮助反动统治的作用吗？
                                                      解其渡
    关于武训的不同认识编辑同志：
    我们在讨论：《武训传》时有三种意见，我们不知那一种对？
    （一）武训是反革命的。
    （二）武训是革命的，是因为环境不同走错了路。
    （三）武训有革命部分，亦有反革命部分。尤其后来完全蜕化为反革命了。
    怎样认识才算正确，请予答复。
                                  孙星燃编辑同志：
    看到五月十六日人民日报上杨耳、邓友梅两位同志关于武训的评论，使我们对武训的所谓“卓越精神”有了进一步的认识。武训苦了一世，然而他没有明确的斗争目标，没有深刻认识到农民穷苦的原因，他不了解农民为什么没有受教育的机会，相反的他向造成这些现象的统治阶级卑躬曲膝，腐蚀了农民的斗争意志。我们在展开讨论后，认为武训的行为实在没有推动了中国历史的前进，没有促进社会经济的向前发展。但我们觉得有下面几个问题：
    （一）武训为穷苦人民能受到教育这一出发点是否还是正确的？他是否是为了义学正封号等个人名誉着想？
    （二）武训的吃苦耐劳精神是否值得我们学习？
    （三）武训兴学当时，山东人民武装反抗统治者的运动实际情况怎样，什么人领导的？结果如何？
    以上几点，即予解释，以便我们更深入一步的展开讨论。
                          王家齐
    “对武训应有一定的评价”编辑同志：
    读贾霁《不足为训的武训》后，觉得有很多独到之处，同时还有一点看法，想提出来讨论一下。
    （一）行乞兴学，是一个偶然的事件，也是一个难能可贵的事件。不能因镜头上的臆造或草率，就否定一切。
    首先，在二千多年的封建社会里，与武训有同样的或类似的境遇的，决不只武训一人，但行乞兴学的确没有第二个。同时，在兴学的长途中，遇到了许多困难，从没有气馁或灰心丧气，这种坚毅的精神与兴学相结合时，似有未可厚非的地方。至于在兴学的当中，是否真的如镜头上所显示的：“打一拳，两个钱；踢一脚，三个钱。”在未经确切调查前，需要打个问号？
    其次，自小从母亲那里，领会读书的好处，决不只武训一人；生活的体验中，加深了热望识字力量的人，也决不只武训。为什么行乞兴学的只有武训呢？丢掉“舍己为人的利他主义”，恐怕不容易找出更好的巨大的精力源泉。这，在“人不为己，天诛地灭”的封建社会里，不能说不是一件奇特的难能可贵的事件。至于在“三天三夜做地狱的幻游梦中而才大彻大悟”的神话，恐怕是编者臆造的插话。
    （二）从效果与动机上看，只能说这是一个典型的悲剧，似不应对生长在典型农村中的武训，有过高的要求或责备。
    为了解决“穷人不受欺压”的大问题，单从识字方面着眼，找不出历史发展的规律，以至于对伟大的太平天国革命运动抱冷淡态度；结果，兴学的目的虽然达到，仍然跳不出“三纲五常”的旧圈子，逐渐走向向统治阶级帮闲、帮忙，以至帮凶的地步。这，不能不说是一个事与愿违的大悲剧！我想：在中国漫长的封建社会里，埋葬在类似武训这样悲剧里的，恐怕也不止武训一个。至于影片中显示的武训与周大的接触，从两者的行动看来，恐怕是插话中的插话或轻率的解释。假如我们要求生长在典型封建农村里的武训，来一个超历史的跳跃，似乎是过高或过苛的。
    认字是武训的主观愿望，不是广大农民生活中的主要要求，确是事实。但，不能以“对识字冷淡”而否定一切。远的不说，就从解放以后说吧，在土地改革完成的农村里，虽然识字的要求比以前迫切了，但在办学校或识字班时，还需要政府或群众团体化费很大力气的。我想，群众所以没有武训那样热望识字的道理之所在，是生活问题，这固然是一个重要的因素；但长期的“民可使由之，不可使知之”的愚民政策的历史毒素，未必一点作祟的影子也没有。
    行乞兴学的“学”，在中国的社会发展中，到底有多少消极与积极的作用？需要组织一个团体，到现在的堂邑县去调查一番。既不能因开始的“学而优则仕”而否定后来的成绩；也不能因后来的成绩而美化以前的缺点或错误。
    （三）武训应有一定的评价，不能从镜头上否定一切。因之，武训有传的必要，但需经过确切调查与编排，要去掉一切臆造或草率，最低要注意下列事实。
    第一、无产阶级产生后的中国，已经跳出了“一治一乱”的旧圈子。经过曲折的道路，不但使武训所梦想的“穷人不受欺压”的事实出现，而且使武训所梦想不到的劳苦大众翻身做主人的社会一天天在壮大着。从这里可以说明：农民革命不能离开无产阶级领导的真理。
    第二、行乞兴的学，虽然被统治者利用它作帮凶，但在动荡的世道中，总是走头无路或到处碰壁的。只是在伟大的抗日战争时期，与共产党接触后，才得了长足的发展，而且充满了光明前途。这一个活生生的事实，决不可或缺，镜头上应该大大地宣扬一番。
    第三、从武训的道路中，说明旧的思想意识害人之深，揭破统治者伪善办学等假面具。同时，在对比中，说明根除旧思想与树立新思想的重要性，批判地接受武训的舍己为人的利他主义与不怕困难的坚毅精神。

  “武训兴义学，意非不正”主笔先生鉴：
    昨阅报载武训传一章，亦欲发言请正。我在民国六七年间，在群强报、国强报常发过牢骚，至今数十年未在报上言谈。因不合潮流，只好独善其身。为环境所迫，未有革命之勇气。细考报纸传单书籍等，皆为最有力之宣传品。自康有为等办报以来，至于现今，真假邪正，效力之大，难以枚举。凡看书报等，应细究其旨。古书不可轻视，孔孟之书亦不可一扫而光，须细揣其意旨，择其善者而从之，其不善者而改之。比如药中之犀角羚羊，本为贵重物品，用之得当，可起死回生；如有人一次吃了一斤，不但不能治病，反倒死了，不究用之不当，反言毒药，对是不对呢？人人皆知牛肉鸡蛋是保养品，一人吃了十斤牛肉，一百个鸡蛋，撑死了，不知用之失当，反言人人不可吃，这是正确不正确呢？武训之为人只知自己不识字，没钱念书，受种种痛苦，他想叫人多识字，写算方便，不受不识字的困难。兴义学为广大人民都要读书，意非不正。武训既不识字，他明白什么叫剥削？什么叫资产阶级？什么叫革命？什么叫威武不能屈，富贵不能移？其兴义学为广众识字，可取而录之；奴颜婢膝，不可取也！深望贵报遇有登载此类事项，先究其意旨。表扬不可吹嘘过当，批评不可钻研揣测，善路不可堵塞。须知报纸一登，万万目所视，若干年历史可垂，可不慎欤？
    因多年不作文字，句多不顺，字多错误，不揣冒昧，请指正！多言多言。
