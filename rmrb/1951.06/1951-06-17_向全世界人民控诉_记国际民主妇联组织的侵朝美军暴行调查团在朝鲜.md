    The International Democratic Women's Federation's investigation team on the atrocities of the American military in Korea collected a large amount of material regarding the barbaric atrocities of the American military in Korea during its twelve-day investigation. From the first day of entering North Korean territory on May 16, the representatives of the investigation team began to see a scene of broken walls, ruins, and scorched earth. The city of Sinuiju, which originally had 14,000 households, had been completely destroyed. The representatives also found traces of a Red Cross symbol on the ruins of a hospital bombed by American planes. Mrs. Rommelaere, the head of the investigation team, said: From Sinuiju to Pyongyang, we could not see a single intact city or village. The representatives personally saw schools, churches, and markets that were bombed or burned by the American bandits, and witnessed the American planes wantonly strafing the elderly, weak, women, and children on the roads.

    In Pyongyang, the investigation team inspected in groups the ruins of cultural facilities such as Kim Il-sung University, Pyongyang Industrial University, Central Hospital, National Art Theater, and large areas of civilian housing that were set on fire by the American aggressors. They listened to the people's accusations against the American aggressors for the collective massacre of Korean patriots and their families. At the same time, they personally witnessed how the American aggressors, day and night, attempted to destroy this beautiful ancient city and slaughter the peaceful and kind-hearted Korean people with bombs and gasoline.

    From May 23, the investigation team split into four groups to investigate various parts of Korea. The representatives who went to Hwanghae Province personally saw the bodies of Korean patriots who had been collectively buried alive by the American aggressors. The people of Sinchon County accused the American and Syngman Rhee gangs of killing more than 25,000 people in the county with extremely brutal methods. Li Haozan, the secretary of the Labor Party branch in Jiangcun Village, Shanchuan District, and his pregnant wife were paraded through the streets with wooden nails hammered into their heads by the bandits, and then beaten to death with clubs. Li Yanyu, the female director of the silkworm farm in Xinjjing Village, Yongfeng District, Hwangchon County, and her four children were tied together by the Americans, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. The local people dug up the bodies from the graves to show them to the representatives of the investigation team. Dr. Felton, a British representative, couldn't help but cry with grief and anger after hearing the people of Sariwon accuse the British invading forces of raping women in the local area.

    Czech representative Svatosslova went to Wonsan to investigate. They lived in a village near Wonsan. She said: "There, from morning to night, we could hear the sounds of American warships shelling the countryside. On May 24, we personally saw twelve farmers and three cows being bombed to death. More than two hundred houses in that village were destroyed by bombing." The representatives of the fourth group also saw similar situations in Nampo Port.

    However, the representatives of the investigation team also saw that the Korean people were by no means intimidated by bombs and bloodshed. West German Democratic Women's representative Wachtel exclaimed: "The Korean people have full confidence in victory and a resolute will to overcome all difficulties. Every Korean person is filled with the spirit of heroism, just like a member of the People's Army. Such a people is unconquerable!"

    The representatives unanimously stated that they would accuse the American aggressors of their atrocities to the people of the world and would do their utmost to support the just struggle of the Korean people. French women's representative Gillette Ziegler said that after returning to her country, she would accuse the American aggressors of their atrocities in various ways and call on the people to rise up to stop the aggression of American imperialism. Cuban women's representative Rodriguez and Argentine women's representative Argeniol said that they would travel to various Latin American countries to give speeches and write articles exposing the various crimes committed by the United States in Korea in violation of international law. Mrs. Rommelaere, the head of the investigation team and a 54-year-old leader of the Canadian democratic women's movement, said: "We will continue to work harder until Korea, Japan, and Germany are completely liberated, until the likes of Hitler and MacArthur are expelled from our countries, and until the world obtains peace."

　　向全世界人民控诉
    记国际民主妇联组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团在朝鲜
    新华社记者  刘桂梁
    国际民主妇女联合会组织的侵朝美军暴行调查团在朝鲜十二天的调查，曾收集到关于侵朝美军野蛮暴行的大量材料。调查团代表们从五月十六日进入朝鲜国境的第一天起，就开始看到一片断垣残瓦、焦土废墟。原来有一万四千住户的新义州市已荡然无存。代表们在一座被美机轰炸过的医院的废墟上，还发现有红十字标记的遗迹。调查团团长罗德夫人说：从新义州到平壤的公路上，我们看不到一座完好的城市或村庄。代表们亲眼看到被美国强盗炸毁或烧毁的学校、教堂和市场，看到美国飞机对行路的老弱妇孺恣意扫射的情况。
    在平壤，调查团分组视察了美国侵略者纵火烧毁的金日成大学、平壤工业大学、中央医院、国立艺术剧场等文化设施和大片民房的废墟，听取了人们对美国侵略者集体屠杀朝鲜爱国者及其家属的控诉；同时，也亲眼看到了美国侵略者如何不分昼夜地企图以炸弹和汽油来毁灭这座美丽的古城、屠杀和平良善的朝鲜人民的情形。
    从五月二十三日起，调查团分成四组到朝鲜各地调查。到黄海道去调查的代表们亲眼看到了被美国侵略者集体活埋的朝鲜爱国者的尸体。信川县的人民向调查团控诉美、李匪帮用惨绝人寰的手段，在该县杀死了二万五千人以上。该县山川区江村里的劳动党支部书记李镐赞和他怀孕的妻子被匪徒们在头部钉上木钉游街，然后，被他们用乱棍打死。黄川县永丰区新井里养蚕所的女所长李妍玉和她的四个孩子被美国人捆在一起，浇上汽油，活活烧死。当地人民曾从坟墓里把尸体挖出来给调查团的代表们看。英籍代表费尔顿博士听到沙里院人民控诉英国侵略军在当地强奸妇女的情形后，不禁悲愤痛哭。
    捷克代表斯瓦托索娃曾去元山调查，她们住在元山附近的一个村庄。她说：“在那里，从早到晚，都听得见美国军舰炮轰农村的声音。五月二十四日，我们亲眼看到了十二个农民和三头牛被炸死。那个村子有二百多所民房被炸毁。”第四组的代表们在南浦港也看到了类似的情形。
    但是，调查团的代表又看到，朝鲜人民绝没有被炸弹和血腥所吓倒。西德民主妇女代表瓦赫特赞叹说：“朝鲜人民有着充分的胜利信心和克服一切困难的坚决斗志。每一个朝鲜人民都像是人民军的一个成员一样地充满了英雄主义的精神。这样的人民是不可征服的！”
    代表们一致表示要向全世界人民控诉美国侵略者的暴行，并将竭尽全力来支援朝鲜人民的正义斗争。法国妇女代表日列特·季格利尔表示，她回国后，将通过各种方式，控诉美国侵略者的暴行，号召人民起来制止美帝国主义的侵略。古巴妇女代表罗得利吉斯和阿根廷妇女代表阿根尼奥尔表示，她们将赴拉丁美洲各国去作旅行演说，写文章揭露美国在朝鲜违反国际法的种种罪行。调查团团长、五十四岁的加拿大民主妇女运动领袖罗德夫人说：“我们将继续努力加紧工作，直到朝鲜、日本、德国完全获得自由，直到希特勒、麦克阿瑟之流从我们的国家被驱逐出去，直到世界获得和平为止。”
