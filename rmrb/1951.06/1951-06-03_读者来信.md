Reader's Letters

We Will Never Fail the Love and Hope of the People of the Motherland

Editor:
    How we care for the people of the motherland on the distant Korean battlefield! When the People's Daily is sent to our unit, every soldier rushes to read it with incomparable affection. Seeing it is like seeing the motherland. In the People's Daily, we learned that the people of the motherland are actively engaged in various constructions, and great movements such as resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries are being carried out in various places. These have given us great excitement and encouragement.
    In the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 18th, I read the letter "After Reading 'Who Are the Most Lovable People'" written by all the staff and workers of the Beicheng Power Station of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau and comrades such as Bai Zhilan of the Beijing No. 1 Girls' High School. I was very touched. From these letters, I felt how the people of the motherland love the motherland and care for us and support us so kindly. Today, we received a large number of condolence money and gifts from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. I was so excited that I shed tears. The love and support of the people of the motherland not only made us proud, but also encouraged our courage and determination to completely annihilate the American aggressors. I know that this is the love and support of millions of people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and also the hope of the motherland for us.
    Editor, please convey it to the beloved people of the motherland! We guarantee that we will never fail the love and hope of the people of the motherland, and we will definitely turn this hope into invincible power to eliminate the American robbers and any aggressors who destroy peace. We vow to protect the motherland and defend world peace to answer the people of the motherland!

Farmers in Shiwangou Village, Feixian County, Sign Patriotic Production Increase Agreement

Editor:
    Now I will report some information about our village:
    All the women with labor in our village participated in this year's weeding work. In order to solve the problem of children, five old women have now formed a group to take care of children. When women in our village go to the fields to work, they send their children to these old women to take care of them. About twenty children are sent every day. Villages outside call this mother group taking care of children a farmer's nursery.
    Our village has now built ten new houses. These houses are much wider than the houses built in the past, and the appearance is also better. Liu Yucheng and Li Maocai, old men in their sixties and seventies in the village, sat at the foot of the wall, winding silk threads while discussing these houses. They said: Looking at the new houses now, the old houses really don't look good. If it goes on like this, the houses in our village will all be bright.
    Our village bought two more cattle this spring, and the Provincial People's Government awarded our village a new plow, and we bought one ourselves. We also bought a lot of new harrows, seeders, and hoes, and added four stone mills. Everyone said: "Adding livestock and farm tools is just adding grain!" Farmers in our village are not afraid to spend money on buying these things.
    Our lives are getting better, and everyone is very motivated to produce. Now, in order to make the days of next year even better, and to protect such good days, everyone in our village has signed a patriotic production increase agreement. This agreement has twelve articles. Now I will tell you a few important articles in this agreement: (1) Fertilizer should be added to farming, and 60 loads of manure should be applied to each mu of land; the land should be deeply ploughed by one finger, harrowed twice, and improved seeds should be selected. (2) Ensure that the mutual aid team does not collapse. Small calculations every five days, a general calculation every ten days, and finding work and food according to the season. (3) The land cultivated on behalf of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers must be guaranteed to have the same harvest as our own land. (4) Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries. Expose rumors and eliminate superstitions. (5) Take one hour every night to listen to newspapers, learn current affairs, and learn culture. (6) All farmers in our village must unite closely within ourselves. If there are shortcomings or mistakes, use criticism to help correct them. There must be no prejudices, and no bad words are allowed behind the back.

The Wuzhou Post Office in Guangxi Implements a System of Advance Payment of Newspaper Fees, Requiring Publicity and Explanation to Subscribers

Editor:
    The Wuzhou Post Office implemented the system of advance payment of newspaper fees, which caused losses to readers due to insufficient preparation. We support the post office's strict implementation of the system of advance payment of newspaper fees in order to simplify internal work procedures and make various newspaper agencies move towards enterprise; however, the implementation of a new system must be carried out with in-depth publicity and mobilization work, especially when the habit of paying newspaper fees after reading them has been followed for a long time, it is even more necessary to patiently persuade them in advance. Although the Wuzhou Post Office also had notices and announcements in advance, this alone was far from enough. The post office implemented this system, doing this from the beginning: anyone who has not paid the newspaper fee at the post office will have their newspaper stopped. As a result, many subscribers did not realize that their newspaper had been stopped by the post office until the newspaper was not delivered. Even if they go to pay and renew their subscription immediately, they will have to wait ten days before they can see the newspaper again (because the Wuzhou Post Office only sends telegrams to add newspapers once every ten days). I am one of the readers who was stopped from seeing the newspaper for ten days, which caused me a great loss in newspaper learning. Therefore, I suggest that the Wuzhou Post Office should improve this method.
                                   Su Shuchao, People's Court of Wuzhou City, Guangxi

Editor's Note: The implementation of the system of advance payment of newspaper fees is a major change in distribution work. In many regions, especially in southern China, readers have been reading newspapers and paying later for many years. Changing this historical accumulation, acting too hastily, or simply engaging in it, will inevitably cause losses to readers. Therefore, the General Post Office of the Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has instructed post offices in various places to concentrate their efforts to mobilize employees to widely publicize and patiently persuade readers when implementing the system of advance payment of newspaper fees. Although the Wuzhou Post Office posted announcements and sent notices at the beginning, these were all necessary, but they were far from enough. It is necessary to mobilize and persuade readers to implement this system more. Of course, all subscribers should also abide by this system. It is also wrong to ignore it if you have already seen the notice and announcement. The system of advance payment of newspaper fees has just begun to be implemented. In order to achieve the universal implementation of this rational system, post offices and newspaper subscribers in various places must work together. As for the fact that readers of the Wuzhou Post Office can only see the newspaper ten days after paying for the subscription, it is indeed too slow. We hope that the Wuzhou Post Office will study and improve it.

专栏：读者来信

　　读者来信
    我们绝不辜负祖国人民的热爱和希望编辑同志：
    我们在遥远的朝鲜战场上，是如何关怀着祖国的人民啊！当人民日报被送到我们部队里的时候，每个战士都以无比亲切的心情抢着读它。看到它，就好象看到了祖国。在人民日报上，我们知道了祖国的人民正积极从事各种建设，抗美援朝、镇压反革命等伟大的运动在各地开展着，这些，都给我们很大的兴奋和鼓舞。
    在四月十八日人民日报《读者来信》栏中，我读到了北京电业局北城发电站全体职工和北京市第一女子中学白治兰等同志所写《读了〈谁是最可爱的人〉》的信，非常感动。从这些信中，我感到祖国的人民是如何热爱着祖国和亲切地关怀我们，支援我们。今天，我们收到了中国人民赴朝慰问团送来的大批慰问金和慰问品，我真有说不出来的兴奋，以至感动得流下热泪来了。祖国人民对我们的热爱和支援，不但使我们感到骄傲，而且鼓舞了我们彻底歼灭美国侵略军的勇气与决心。我知道这是在共产党、毛主席英明领导下的千百万人民对我们的热爱和支援，也是祖国对我们的希望。
    编辑同志，请你转达给祖国亲爱的人民吧！我们保证：绝不辜负祖国人民对我们的热爱和希望，一定把这希望变成无敌的力量去消灭美国强盗和任何破坏和平的侵略者。我们誓以保卫祖国，保卫世界和平来回答祖国的人民！

            费县十万沟村农民订立爱国增产公约编辑同志：
    现在再把我村的一些情况报告一下：
    我村有劳动力的妇女都曾参加了今年锄麦工作。为了解决小孩问题，现在已由五个老妈妈组成了一个看小孩组。俺村妇女下地工作时，就把小孩交给这几个老妈妈看管，一天大约有二十多个小孩送来。外村都把这个看小孩的妈妈组叫做农民托儿所。
    俺村现在又盖好了十间新房子，这些房子比过去盖的房子宽大的多了，样子也好看了。村子里六、七十岁的老头子刘玉成和李茂彩坐在墙脚下，一边撵山茧线，一边议论着这些房子。他们说：一看现在的新屋，看着过去的房子真不像样。像现在这样下去，俺们村的房子就都亮堂起来了。
    俺村今春又买了两头大牛，省人民政府奖给俺村新式犁一张，自己又买了一张。新式耙、耩子、锄，也都买了不少，礳增加了四盘。大家都说：“增加了耕畜和农具还不就是增加了粮食！”俺村农民在买这些东西上都不怕花钱。
    俺们生活过好了，大家生产都很有劲头儿。现在俺村为了要叫明年的日子过得更好，为了要保住这样的好日子，大家就订下了一个爱国增产公约。这个公约共有十二条，现在把这个公约中重要的几条告诉你：（一）种田要加肥料，每亩地要上粪六十担；要深耕一指，耙两遍，选用优良种籽。（二）保证互助组不垮台。五天一小算，十天一总算，按季节找工找粮。（三）替革命烈士、革命军人家属代耕的地，要保证和自己的地一样收成。（四）坚决镇压反革命。揭发谣言，破除迷信。（五）每天晚上抽出一小时听念报纸，学时事，学文化。（六）俺全村农民自己内部要团结紧，有缺点，有错误，用批评的方法帮助改正，不许有成见，不许背后说坏话。

        实行报费预收制度要向订户宣传解释编辑同志：
    梧州邮局执行报费预收制度，因准备工作做得不够，使读者受到了损失。邮局为了简化内部工作的手续，并使各报社走向企业化，严格实行报费预收制度，我们是拥护的；但一种新制度的实行，必须要深入进行宣传动员工作，尤其是在后付报费这一习惯已沿习很久的情况下，事先更须要耐心的说服。梧州邮局虽然事先也有通知、启事，但仅这样做是很不够的。而邮局执行这一制度，一开始就这样做：凡未上邮局缴报费的就给把报停了。这样一来好多订户直到报纸没有送来时，才发觉报纸被邮局停了。就是马上去缴款续订，也得要等十天才能再看到报纸（因为梧州邮局十天才发一次增加报纸的电报）。我就是被停止了十天看不到报纸的读者之一，使我对报纸学习，受到了很大的损失。因此我建议梧州邮局应改善这种办法。
                                   广西梧州市人民法院  苏淑超
    编者按：实行报费预收制度，是发行工作上的一个重大变革。许多地区，尤其是我国南部，读者多年来是先看报后付款的。改变这种有历史性的积习，操之过急，或简单从事，必然要造成读者的损失。因此，中央邮电部邮政总局曾指示各地邮局，在执行报费预收制度时，必须集中力量动员员工广泛宣传，耐心说服读者。梧州邮局一开始登了启事，发了通知，这都是必要的，但是很不够的。必须多动员说服读者执行这个制度。当然，各订户也应当遵守这制度。如果已经见到通知和启事，而置之不理也不对的。报费预收制度才开始实行，欲求得这一合理的制度普遍贯彻，必须各地邮局及报纸订户共同努力。至于梧州邮局当读者缴款订报后十天才能看到报纸，确是太慢了，望梧州邮局研究改进。
