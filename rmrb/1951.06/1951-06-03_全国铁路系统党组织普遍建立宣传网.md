　　Party Organizations in the National Railway System
    Universally Establish Propaganda Networks
    The organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in the national railway system have established propaganda networks. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 15,000 propagandists in the national railways; among them, the Northeast Railway and the China Changchun Railway Bureau have a total of 11,600 propagandists; and the Tianjin Railway Administration has about 1,000 propagandists.
    Railway propagandists in various places have created many new forms and methods of propaganda in current affairs propaganda. For example, the "train propaganda" method created by the Datong Train Section of the Tianjin Railway Administration has achieved very good results. This method has been widely adopted by the Northeast and Northern Railways. Some train propagandists in Wuchang, Liuzhou and other places of the Hengyang Railway Administration have organized passengers to hold current affairs seminars, which have also been very effective.
    On the railways where propaganda networks have been established, the work of the propagandists has played a significant role in strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses and boosting production enthusiasm. More than 90 percent of the 200,000 employees of the Northeast Railway have listened to current affairs reports from reporters and propagandists. These reports have inspired their patriotic enthusiasm. The propagandists also promptly disseminated the intentions of the leadership and production plans to the masses, making the plans quickly transform into the actions of the masses themselves.

　　全国铁路系统党组织
    普遍建立宣传网
    全国铁路系统的中国共产党的组织已建立宣传网。据不完全的统计，全国铁路已有宣传员一万五千余名；其中东北铁路和中长铁路局共有宣传员一万一千六百名；天津铁路管理局有宣传员约一千名。
    各地铁路宣传员在时事宣传中，创造了许多新的宣传形式和宣传方法。如天津铁路管理局大同列车段所创造的“列车宣传”方法，收到了很好的效果。这种方法已经被东北和北方铁路普遍采用。衡阳铁路管理局武昌、柳州等地有些列车宣传员组织旅客举行时事座谈会，收效也很大。
    在已经建立宣传网的铁路上，宣传员工作对加强党与群众的联系，鼓舞生产热情等方面，都起了很大的作用。东北铁路二十万职工中，有百分之九十以上听过报告员和宣传员的时事报告。这些报告启发了他们的爱国热情。宣传员并及时地把领导意图和生产计划传播到群众中去，使计划很快地变成了群众自己的行动。
