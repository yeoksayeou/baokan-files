Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 19th. TASS Moscow, June 19th: *Pravda's* Paris correspondent, Zhukov, wrote an article commenting on the results of the French parliamentary elections. He pointed out that definite figures show that the plans of the French reactionaries, directed by Washington, have suffered a serious defeat. Washington first hoped that the insidious new election law would exclude the Communist Party from the new parliament. Secondly, the election was held ahead of schedule, during which the reactionaries unscrupulously slandered the Communist Party and openly threatened progressive groups and leaders. Washington hoped that this would cause a large number of voters to abandon the candidates of the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance.

Zhukov wrote: According to preliminary materials, the bourgeois parties' election alliance won about half of the total votes, and as a result, seized all the seats in forty-two of the ninety provinces in France. However, it can be said that their plan to completely expel the Communists from the parliament has met with a shameful failure. So far, the fate of five hundred and seventy-seven of the total six hundred and twenty-seven seats in the parliament has been revealed. The election results show that the political tricks of the bourgeois parties have come to their inevitable end. At their own expense, these parties helped De Gaulle install his one hundred and ten stormtroopers into the parliament. Together with him are ninety-four so-called "moderates" and eighty-six representatives of the so-called "Left Republican Alliance"; these groups form the so-called "Fourth Force," behind which is hidden a large number of disguised De Gaulle supporters. The right-wing Socialist Party will occupy ninety-eight seats. The People's Republican Movement, although allied with all parties, has lost almost half of its seats, leaving eighty-five.

Zhukov pointed out: The Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance, headed by the Communist Party, fought hard. It faced all the bourgeois parties single-handedly. It was framed and slandered by others. Its voters were often deprived of the right to vote. Tens of thousands of votes obtained by its candidates were declared invalid. In dozens of provinces where the bourgeois party groups "won," the votes obtained by the Communist Party were not counted. However, despite all these obstacles, among the five hundred and seventy-seven elected members, one hundred and three are candidates of the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance. One hundred and three out of five hundred and seventy-seven! Each of them received more support from voters than any member of the bourgeois parties.

Zhukov particularly pointed out: Voters expressed their trust in every outstanding leader of the Communist Party. Although the reactionary newspapers spared no effort to slander them during the election campaign, Thorez, Duclos, Marty, Cachin, Fajon, Guyot, Florant, Piou, Vimeux, Bonté and others were still elected as members of parliament. In Seine-et-Marne, where Casanova ran for election, although the reactionaries formed a unified group to oppose the Communist Party, Casanova was still elected.

In the mining province of Pas-de-Calais, the Communists, headed by Léger, the secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, achieved the greatest victory. They were opposed by the bourgeois party group formed by the Socialist leader Mollet. The Communist Party's list of candidates received 7,000 more votes than in 1946, and it not only maintained its original three seats, but also gained one more seat.

Also elected to the parliament were these outstanding leaders of the French democratic camp, such as Goddet, Weigel, General Joinville, Madame Marie-Claude, Madame Vaillant-Couturier, Madame Mathilde Péri, and many others.

Zhukov emphasized that the reactionaries' plan suffered a miserable defeat in the recently concluded French election. He pointed out: Representatives of the reactionaries, such as Michelet (former Minister of Defense) and Dailleur, leading figures of the De Gaulle party, Ramadier and Philip, leaders of the right-wing Socialist Party, and many others like them, have been defeated.

Zhukov pointed out that, however, we still cannot underestimate the fascist danger threatening France, and it would be wrong to estimate it that way. Due to the betrayal conspiracy of the right-wing Socialist Party and the People's Republican Movement, the door to the parliament was opened for one hundred and ten representatives of the De Gaulle party and a larger number of De Gaulle elements disguised as the "Fourth Force," threatening France with fascism. The French reactionaries failed to realize their election plan. After the defeat, they are now trying to regroup all their forces. Since it could not crush the Communist Party in the parliament as required by the American occupiers and turn the National Assembly into a Hitler-like parliament where De Gaulle reigns supreme, it is now attempting to test the path of a "classic right-wing regime" for the Third Republic. At the campaign conferences in the bourgeois areas of Paris, the candidates of the "Fourth Force" repeatedly said shamelessly: "Why do we need to call De Gaulle to suppress communism? Didn't Daladier already prove in 1939 that he could do this job?" These words are very noteworthy.

But although these words pleased the French bourgeoisie who longed for the "good old days," the French working people and the French people still remember Daladier's Munich betrayal, and they are fully determined to fight back against these restorationists and De Gaulle.

　　朱可夫评论法国大选
    法反动派企图将法共排斥议会之外的阴谋已遭到了可耻的失败
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫撰文评论法国议会选举的结果。他指出，确凿的数字说明华盛顿所指使的法国反动派的计划遭受了严重的失败。华盛顿方面首先希望，阴险的新选举法能够把共产党排斥于新议会之外。其次，这次选举是提前举行的，在这当中反动派毫无顾忌地对共产党进行污蔑，公开威吓进步的团体和领袖。华盛顿方面希望这样便能使大批选民背弃共和反法西斯抵抗联盟的候选人。
    朱可夫写道：根据初步的材料，资产阶级各党派的竞选联盟总共取得了选票的半数左右，结果便攫取了法国九十省之中四十二省的全部席位。然而，可以说，他们想完全把共产党人逐出议会的计划却遭到了可耻的失败。至今为止，议会全部六百二十七个席位中，五百七十七个席位的命运是已经揭晓了。选举结果的数字说明，资产阶级各政党的政治把戏已得到了当然的结局。这些政党以自己的损失为代价，而帮助戴高乐把他一百十一名冲锋队员安插到议会里去了。和他同道的还有九十四名所谓“温和分子”和八十六名所谓“左翼共和联盟”的代表；这种种集团形成了所谓“第四种力量”，在这块招牌后面隐藏了大量伪装起来的戴高乐分子。右翼社会党将占九十八席。人民共和党虽然和一切党派都结了联盟，但几乎丧失了他们议席的一半，还余下八十五席。
    朱可夫指出：以共产党为首的共合反法西斯抵抗联盟，进行了艰苦的奋斗。它单枪匹马地对付所有各资产阶级政党。它被别人陷害污蔑。它所拥有的选民常常被剥夺投票的权利。它的候选人所获得的成千成万的票被宣布作废。在资产阶级政党集团“获胜”的几十个省份里，共产党所得的票都不算数。然而，纵使有着这一切阻挠，在全部当选的五百七十七名议员当中，有一百零三名是共和反法西斯抵抗联盟的候选人。五百七十七个当中有一百零三个啊！他们每一个人比资产阶级政党任何议员都获得更多选民的支持。
    朱可夫特别指出：选民对共产党每一杰出的领袖表示信任。虽然在竞选运动当中，反动报纸尽情对他们加以恶毒的诽谤，然而多列士、杜克洛、马尔梯、加香、法戎、葛约、佛拉商、皮佑、维美徐、邦特等人仍都当选了议员。在卡桑诺伐所竞选的塞纳—马恩省，虽然反动派组成了统一的集团对付共产党，但是卡桑诺伐仍当选了。
    在矿工省加莱海峡省，以法国共产党中央委员会书记列戈尔为首的共产党人取得了最伟大的胜利。他们受到社会党领袖摩勒所组成的资产阶级政党集团的反对。共产党的候选人名单比一九四六年多得了七千张选票，它不仅保持了原有的三个议席，还多得到了一个议席。
    被选入议会的还有法国民主阵营的这些杰出的领袖，如哥德，魏基利，儒恩维尔将军，马里·克劳第夫人，瓦扬—古久里夫人，玛第达·贝丽夫人及其他多人。
    朱可夫着重说明反动派的计划在已经结束的法国选举中遭到了惨败。他指出：反动派的代表如戴高乐党的首脑人物米歇莱（前国防部长）和戴勒诺尔，右翼社会党的领袖拉马第和费力普和像他们一类的其他许多人都已落选了。
    朱可夫指出，然而，我们仍旧不能低估威胁着法国的法西斯危险，如果那样估计便是错误的。由于右翼社会党和人民共和党的出卖阴谋，为一百十一名戴高乐党的代表和更大量以“第四种力量”为伪装的戴高乐分子打开了议会的大门，而使法西斯主义威胁着法国。法国反动派没有能够实现它的选举计划，在失败之余，他们现在正企图重新集结全部力量。它既不能如美国占领者的要求那样，在议会中粉碎共产党，把国民议会变成戴高乐君临一切的像希特勒的国会那样的东西，于是就企图为第三共和国试验“古典的右倾政权”的道路。在巴黎资产阶级区域的竞选会议上，“第四种力量”的候选人多次无耻绝顶地说：“为什么我们要叫戴高乐来镇压共产主义呢？达拉第在一九三九年难道不是已经证明了他自己就能做这工作吗？”这种话是很值得注意的。
    但是这种话虽然取悦了渴望“过去的好日子”的法国资产阶级，然而法国劳动人民和法国人民还记得达拉第的慕尼黑叛卖事件，他们是有充分决心反击这些复辟者和戴高乐的。
