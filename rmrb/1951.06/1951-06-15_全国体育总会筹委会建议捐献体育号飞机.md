　　Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation
    Suggests Donating a Sports Aircraft
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency: The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation issued a notice regarding the donation of a "Sports Aircraft," stating: We suggest that sports workers and athletes across the country donate a "Sports Aircraft," as well as other weapons like tanks and artillery. The donation methods are as follows:
    (1) Various sports benefit competitions or performances (such as ball games, track and field, gymnastics, Chinese martial arts, swimming, rowing, etc.) should be widely held in various regions, with provinces or cities as the units. Local sports associations should immediately formulate plans in conjunction with educational administrative organs and relevant units such as the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and student federations to preside over the benefit competitions. In places where sports associations have not yet been established, we suggest that the local sports community jointly preside over them. When holding benefit competitions, it is important to publicize the important significance of carrying out patriotic donation campaigns and sports activities, mobilize the broad masses to purchase tickets to attend, and donate all ticket sales revenue, minus expenses. Attention should also be paid to minimizing expenses as much as possible.
    (2) Sports workers who have salary income or other temporary income can generally participate in the donation of their unit, and report the donation amount to the local sports association or the All-China Sports Federation. However, they can also participate in the donation of the "Sports Aircraft" according to the principle of voluntariness and individual ability.
    (3) The patriotic donation campaign is tentatively set for a period of six months. All donations must be completely voluntary, and no one shall use coercive methods. Local sports associations and the organs presiding over the benefit competitions should concentrate all donations and income from the benefit competitions and remit them to the China Youth Daily in Beijing for safekeeping.
