　　Three Old Workers from Zhengzhou Who Participated in the "February 7th" Strike
    Write a Letter Thanking Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:

    We three are old workers from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot. We all participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike. Now we have gloriously retired. When we look back on the dark and painful lives we lived in the past, and then look at the new China and new society led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party today, our hearts are filled with joy and infinite emotion!

    Among the three of us, some farmed the land for landlords since childhood, and later became coal loaders and train wipers on the railway; others worked as fitters in railway factories all their lives. In the old society, being a worker meant being a slave, and enduring humiliation. Imperialists and warlord bureaucrats rode on our heads, and we could never lift our heads.

    Since participating in the "February 7th" Great Strike, we have realized that only the Communist Party is the party that leads the working class to complete liberation. From then on, we and some fellow workers often talked about and thought about the Communist Party, and inquired about news about the Communist Party.

    Respected Chairman Mao! You led the Chinese people through arduous and tortuous struggles, and finally defeated the internal and external enemies who oppressed the Chinese people, and won today's victory. Only then could our working class stand up and become the masters of the country. Now, according to the "Labor Insurance Regulations" promulgated by the Central People's Government, we have gloriously retired. We can receive pensions from the state every month, and live a happy life in our old age. Our children also have jobs and food, and we no longer have to worry about them.

    When we drink water, we think of its source. First of all, we want to thank our respected Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

    Although we have retired, as long as we have a bit of strength, we will still contribute it. We can't work with our hands anymore, but we can use our mouths to carry out propaganda to the masses. We must publicize the policies of the Chinese Communist Party to the masses at all times and everywhere, publicize the reasons for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, and educate our children to love the Communist Party and love the new China.

　　郑州三位参加过“二七”罢工的老工人        
    退休后写信感谢毛主席敬爱的毛主席：
    我们三个都是郑州铁路局机务段的老工人，过去都曾参加过“二七”大罢工，现在我们光荣地退休了。我们回想过去多年所过的黑暗痛苦的生活，再看看今天毛主席共产党领导的新中国、新社会，心中无限欢喜，也有无限的感慨！
    我们三个人中，有的自小就给地主种地，后来就在铁路上当抬煤夫、擦车夫；有的在铁路工厂里，干了一辈子钳工。在旧社会，当工人就是当奴隶，就得受肮脏气；帝国主义分子和军阀官僚们骑在我们头上，我们怎么也抬不起头来。
    自从参加“二七”大罢工后，我们就认识到，只有共产党才是领导工人阶级彻底翻身的政党。从那时起，我们和一些工友就常谈论和想念着共产党，打听关于共产党的消息。
    敬爱的毛主席！您领导着中国人民，经过千辛万苦的曲折斗争，终于打垮了压在中国人民头上的内外敌人，赢得了今天的胜利；咱们工人阶级才得翻过身来，当了国家的主人。现在根据中央人民政府公布的“劳动保险条例”，我们光荣地退休了。我们每月可以拿到国家发给我们的养老金，过着幸福的晚年生活。我们的儿女，也都有工作，有饭吃，再也用不着我们发愁了。
    我们饮水思源，首先要感谢敬爱的毛主席，感谢共产党。
    我们虽然退休了，但是，只要有一分力量，仍然要贡献出来。我们用手工作是不行了，但可用嘴向群众进行宣传。我们要随时随地向群众宣传中国共产党的政策，宣传抗美援朝保家卫国的道理，教育自己的子女爱护共产党，爱护新中国。
