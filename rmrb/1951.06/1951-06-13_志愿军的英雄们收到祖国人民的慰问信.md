　　The heroes and heroic units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have received letters of condolence from the people of the motherland. The envelopes of these letters were written in red with the names and titles of the heroes, and some also briefly described their heroic deeds. The people of Dayuan District, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, wrote many letters of condolence to Jiang Wenwu, who shot down an enemy plane with three bullets, and Chen Desheng, the lone hero who single-handedly charged into the enemy's battle formation in the battle on the south bank of the Han River. Some letters began with: "We are writing to you today—International Labor Day, to express our condolences." The women's reading group of Zhuanjingtai, Third District, Longsheng County, Suiyuan Province, wrote a letter on April 7th to the combat hero Li Fugui, who was wounded but refused to leave the front line in the battle on the south bank of the Han River. The letter said: "After we thirty women finished reading about your heroic deeds, we were so excited that we couldn't say anything! We are very moved by your spirit of persisting in killing the enemy despite your injuries. Comrade: You have not disappointed the expectations of the people of the whole country. Your glorious title of 'Lone Hero' will exist forever like the sun. We hope that your injuries will heal quickly, and that you will go to the front line again and kill more American devils. We must learn from your revolutionary heroism of loving the motherland and loving Korea, and we guarantee to step up production and support you in winning the battle."

　　志愿军的英雄们收到祖国人民的慰问信
    中国人民志愿军中的许多英雄人物和英雄单位，收到了祖国人民写给他们的慰问信。这些信的信封上用红字写着英雄们的姓名和称号，有的还简要地写上他们的英雄事迹。浙江富阳县大源区的人民写了好多封慰问信给用三发子弹打落敌机的姜文武，和在汉江南岸阻击战中只身冲入敌阵的孤胆英雄陈德生。有的信在开头写着：“我们特在今天——五一国际劳动节，向你致书慰问。”绥远龙胜县三区转经台妇女读报组，——在四月七日写了一封信给在汉江南岸阻击战中负伤不下火线的战斗英雄李富贵。信里说：“我们三十个妇女在读完了你的英雄事迹后，兴奋得说不出什么来啦！你这种带伤坚持杀敌的精神，使我们非常感动。同志：你没有辜负全国人民的嘱托。你的光荣的‘独胆英雄’称号象太阳一样永远存在。我们希望你的伤快些好，再上前线，多杀些美国鬼子。我们一定要向你的爱祖国、爱朝鲜的革命英雄主义精神学习，并且保证加紧生产，支援你们打胜仗。”
