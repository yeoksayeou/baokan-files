　　Launching Patriotic Production Competitions is the Best Way to Lead Production
　　Special Correspondent for this Newspaper Wu Guangtang
　　1. Characteristics of This Spring's Competition
　　The patriotic production competition launched in rural Shanxi this spring was initiated and promoted under the call of Li Shunda. The scale of this competition is unprecedented, and the content is extremely rich. Sixty-four counties, one hundred and sixty-three villages, and two thousand and forty-five mutual aid teams in the province have responded to the challenge of the Li Shunda mutual aid team. These units also launched competition challenges to various districts and villages in their counties. According to statistics from thirty-three counties, more than seven thousand mutual aid teams and seven hundred and ninety-one villages have been involved in the competition. In Ping Shun, 91% of the villages participated in the competition. Water conservancy, cotton planting, cooperation, forestry, and women's labor models in various places have successively challenged their counterparts across the province. In order to do their jobs well and lead production, the county and district cadres of Lucheng County challenged the county and district cadres of Ping Shun County. The cadres of the first district of Lishi challenged the cadres of the seventh district. The Party branch of Dazhai in Yu She and Shili in Hu Guan, and the Communist Youth League of Ma Tian in Zuo Quan and Chuan Di in Ping Shun, respectively challenged the Party branches and Communist Youth Leagues across the province. This kind of vertical, horizontal, interlocking, and content-rich competition movement constitutes the new characteristics of this spring's patriotic production competition.
　　This year's production competition is closely integrated with the current political struggle. In addition to good production as the main condition, the competition content also includes all aspects of rural work: such as current affairs study, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, culture and hygiene, preferential treatment for military families and farming on their behalf, grain delivery and tax payment, and leadership style. The ten patriotic production competition covenants proposed by the labor model Hou Zhenhai mutual aid team in Dongshan, Wenxi, include very rich content: (1) Compete in patriotism: oppose America and love the country, support the Communist Party and the People's Government, implement policies and laws, support the Volunteer Army, and give preferential treatment to military families. (2) Compete in public security: expose counter-revolutionaries, ban the Yi Guan Dao sect, strengthen militia armaments, and protect production. (3) Compete in expanding cotton fields. (4) Compete in mutual aid. (5) Compete in labor. (6) Compete in women's participation in production. (7) Compete in crops and harvests. (8) Compete in raising livestock well. (9) Compete in prosperity: achieve that every family has a plan and every household has surplus grain. (10) Compete in running schools: the mutual aid team has also stipulated the implementation steps and methods according to the content of the covenant. Wu Xiang, He Shun, Chang Zhi, and other counties have listed doing a good job in farming on behalf of military families as one of the important conditions for competition. The masses in Wu Xiang call preferential treatment for military families "blood and sweat mutual aid," which further inspires the masses' enthusiasm for patriotism and support for the military. In the production competition, most mutual aid teams in Ping Shun, Hu Guan, Jin Cheng and other counties subscribed to newspapers, turning the mutual aid teams into reading groups. Before the competition, Wang Village in Gao Ping only had one newspaper, but after the competition, it increased to twenty-one, with nearly three hundred people participating in the reading group. The production competition has not only promoted the production movement but also promoted various aspects of rural work. Therefore, launching a patriotic bumper harvest competition is the best way to lead production and is also a leadership method of the mass line from the bottom up.
　　2. Combining with Patriotism
　　This year's patriotic bumper harvest competition in Shanxi, like other regions, was launched on the basis of patriotic ideological education for resisting America and aiding Korea. In the past, in our production movement, we simply put forward the slogan of "getting rich through production and becoming wealthy through labor," which played a great role in overcoming farmers' agricultural socialist ideology, encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for production, and establishing the idea that labor is glorious. However, this slogan lacked political content, and therefore could not overcome the idea of going it alone among the masses and the idea of retreating among the cadres. This year, we combined the production movement with patriotism, and a new atmosphere immediately appeared in the countryside. After the anti-American and national defense education and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the masses' ideological awareness has been greatly improved. In the painful memories of "thinking of Japan when mentioning the American Empire," the peasants fully understand that in order to produce with peace of mind, they must resist America and defend the country, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, that is, as the masses themselves say: "We must remove the American root and get rid of the root of disaster, so that we can plant the root of wealth." Therefore, the masses have begun to realize that their production is not only for getting rich but also for consolidating the motherland. Learning from Li Shunda, a dual model of patriotic production, has become a unanimous slogan for participants in the competition. In the competition movement, many mutual aid teams paid great attention to learning about current affairs, which played a decisive role in continuously encouraging patriotic enthusiasm and production mood. As Qin Songfa, a labor model from Liuze, Hu Guan, said: "The more we study current affairs, the greater our enthusiasm for production becomes." The production competition movement over the past three months has made us more aware of the importance of "economic construction must be combined with political struggle." This is the basic experience in this year's patriotic production competition, and it is also the basic driving force for making the patriotic production competition lasting and consolidated.
　　3. Specific Leadership, In-Depth Inspection
　　Specific leadership and in-depth inspection are important keys to carrying out patriotic production competitions and ensuring that the movement is in-depth and lasting. In this year's spring competition movement, we have made preliminary achievements in this regard, but at the same time, many deviations have occurred.
　　(1) Organize a special appraisal committee for the patriotic production competition, responsible for guiding and appraising the competition. More than ten counties in the Chang Zhi Special District convened mutual aid representatives' meetings to discuss and arrange the production competition and drafted the organizational methods of the production competition appraisal committee. Appraisal committees were established in counties, districts, and participating villages, responsible for guiding the competition movement. Most of the villages and mutual aid teams participating in the competition have formulated their own village or team production plans as competition goals. This is not only conducive to the inspection and promotion of the production competition but also has great significance for the entire production movement. However, there are still some areas that only issue calls, lack specific guidance, and do not organize appraisals, making the competition movement hot at first and then cold, and unable to be implemented. Some units only set annual goals, lacking seasonal plans. Some units only make requests, lacking guarantees. The above-mentioned deviations will make the competition become a formality.
　　(2) The large-scale competition movement led by Li Shunda must be combined with the small-group competition with a region as a unit. Well-known labor models in various places responded to the challenge of Li Shunda, and at the same time challenged various mutual aid teams or labor models in their localities, thus forming a competition movement centered on the model figures who are very familiar to the local masses under the call and encouragement of Li Shunda. In the old areas, competitions are generally carried out with small areas as units (about six or seven villages), and in the new areas, competitions are carried out with districts or counties as units. Zuo Quan, Wu Xiang, and other counties have formulated interlocking competition contracts within the scope of small-group competitions, stipulating joint inspections, mutual visits, and comparisons at certain times. This has further consolidated the enthusiasm for competition and made the mutual relations between competitors exceptionally close. This is the foundation of the large-scale competition movement, and as long as the foundation is well laid, the appraisal of the large-scale competition will be relatively easy. In the joint inspection of small groups, it is necessary not only to check the achievements but also to absorb experience and learn technology. Some regions also use the guidance method of cultivating typical examples, taking the villages where labor models are located as the base points to carry out competitions and conduct regular inspections. In this way, the achievements of advanced villages can be used to encourage general villages, and the experience of advanced villages can be used to educate general villages. However, some villages only simply challenge Li Shunda, without paying attention to specifically organizing competitions according to local conditions, making the competition lack a foundation and become a formality. Some people feel that Li Shunda's average yield of 378 catties per mu is double the pre-war level, so they lack confidence and dare not respond to the challenge, which has limited the development of the competition movement.
　　(3) Launching and leading the patriotic production competition should mainly rely on labor mutual aid teams. In the rural competition in Shanxi, 90% of it is carried out on the basis of mutual aid teams. The formulation of patriotic covenants and production plans is mostly based on mutual aid teams as units. Experience has proved that the patriotic production competition movement can be more widely developed, consolidated, and lasting only if a large number of people are mobilized and organized. Of course, the competition for "individual households" should also be led, and "individual households" cannot be kept out of the patriotic production competition. Especially for certain skilled workers, bumper harvest experts, and those engaged in specialized businesses (such as forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy), more attention should be paid to cultivating and establishing typical examples and directions in different regions and different industries. However, large-scale competition movements are only possible on the basis of organization. At the same time, the patriotic production competition movement has also vigorously promoted the further development of organization. In some areas, mutual aid teams have not been organized in the production competition, and therefore the competition movement has also shown sluggishness.
　　(4) Labor models are the leaders of the patriotic production competition and also the backbone of leading the competition. Most of the representatives who attended the provincial labor model conference and the labor model conferences in various counties last year were involved in the production competition and became the core of the competition movement. In the competition movement, a new batch of production activists and labor models emerged. Some areas combined the inspection of the competition in the spring sowing to elect labor models and model mutual aid teams. As a result, the movement to cultivate model mutual aid teams and model production villages in various places this year has been combined with the patriotic production competition movement.
　　4. Summarize the Spring Competition and Launch the Summer Competition
　　The spring patriotic production competition has come to an end. According to existing report materials, more than 2,000 mutual aid teams have conducted evaluations and summaries, elected models, and put forward the content and conditions for the summer competition, making a new launch for the summer competition. In terms of the summarization methods, most of them are based on mutual aid teams as units, first conducting inspections from households to teams, and then organizing joint visits and joint evaluations with small groups or small areas as units. Lingchuan and other counties also summarized the county's patriotic bumper harvest competition movement in the form of mutual aid team representatives' meetings. Around May 20, Li Shunda began to report on the spring production results to the country, and then the province launched evaluations and summaries. Eighty-three mutual aid teams in Xiang Yuan conducted inspections and summaries based on five standards: "competing in patriotism, competing in mutual aid, competing in leadership, competing in technology, and competing in achievements." These eighty-three mutual aid teams have all achieved the original planned requirements, and sixty-four teams have exceeded the plan. In the evaluation and summary, in addition to affirming the achievements and criticizing the shortcomings, the successful experiences were summarized, such as Lingchuan and Hu Guan adopting the method of "short plans and frequent inspections" in the competition to promote the movement.
　　Various places have deployed the summer competition on the basis of summarizing the spring competition. Xiang Yuan put forward a ten-item summer work plan. This plan continues to deepen and deepen the anti-American and patriotic ideological education, complete the summer production tasks, hoe seedlings and topdress, eliminate insects and prevent pests, and formulate wheat protection covenants to protect the summer harvest as the main content. Other places have also put forward specific goals and guarantee conditions for the summer competition. However, from the current point of view, the following issues must be paid attention to in order to carry out the summer department competition: The first is to penetrate into backward areas to strive for balanced development. Although the scale of the competition movement is unprecedented in the province, there are still many areas that have not yet been involved in the movement. The main reason is that in-depth anti-American and national defense ideology has not been carried out, and attention has not been paid to organizing and cultivating production activists. Some areas conduct anti-American and national defense propaganda and education and suppression of counter-revolutionaries work in isolation, without organizing the masses' anti-American and patriotic enthusiasm into production competitions. Therefore, in the summer production competition, the leadership must plan to organize forces, penetrate into backward areas, and provide specific assistance, so that the patriotic production competition can be widely carried out. The second is to continue to overcome formalism, correct the phenomenon of a few cadres substituting for and monopolizing things, and the shortcomings of only making general calls, not giving specific leadership, not inspecting, and not summarizing. The above-mentioned phenomena must be overcome in the summer production competition. Again, commandism and championshipism in the production competition still exist in individual areas, and attention should also be paid to correcting and strictly preventing its continuation.

　　发动爱国生产竞赛是领导生产的最好方法
    本报特约记者  武光汤
    第一、今春竞赛的特点
    山西农村中在今年春季发起的爱国生产竞赛，是在李顺达的号召推动下开展起来的。这次竞赛的规模是空前的，内容是极其丰富的。全省已有六十四县、一百六十三个村、二千零四十五个互助组向李顺达互助组应战。这些单位同时向本县各区村发起了竞赛挑战，据三十三个县统计，已有七千多个互助组及七百九十一个村卷入了竞赛运动。平顺卷入竞赛的村庄达百分之九十一。各地水利、植棉、合作、林业及妇女劳动模范，纷纷向全省的相同业务者挑战。为了做好岗位工作，领导好生产，潞城全县县、区干部向平顺全县县、区干部挑战。离石一区干部向七区干部挑战。榆社大寨、壶关十里党支部，左权麻田、平顺川底的青年团，分别向全省的党支部、青年团挑战。这样纵横、连环、内容丰富的竞赛运动，构成了今春爱国主义生产竞赛的新特点。
    今年的生产竞赛，是与当前的政治斗争密切结合着的。竞赛内容，除以搞好生产为主要条件外，并包括了农村工作的各个方面：如时事学习、镇压反革命、文化卫生、优军代耕、交粮纳税以及领导作风等。闻喜东山的劳动模范侯振海互助组提出的十项爱国生产竞赛公约，即包括了十分丰富的内容：（一）比爱国：即反美爱国、拥护共产党和人民政府、执行政策法令、支援志愿军、优待军属。（二）比治安：即检举反革命、取缔一贯道、加强民兵武装、保卫生产。（三）比扩大棉田。（四）比互助。（五）比劳动。（六）比妇女参加生产。（七）比庄稼、比收成。（八）比牲口喂养得好坏。（九）比光景：即做到家家有计划，户户有余粮。（十）比办学校：该互助组并根据公约内容规定了实施步骤及办法。武乡、和顺、长治等县把做好代耕工作，列为竞赛的重要条件之一。武乡群众称优军代耕为“血汗互助”，更启发了群众爱国优军的积极性。在生产竞赛中，平顺、壶关、晋城等县大部分互助组订了报纸，把互助组变成读报组。高平王村竞赛前只有一份报纸，竞赛后增至二十一份，近三百人参加了读报组。生产竞赛不仅推进了生产运动，同时推动了农村各方面的工作。因此，发动爱国丰产竞赛，是领导生产的最好的方法，也是自下而上的群众路线的领导方法。
  第二、与爱国主义相结合
    今年山西的爱国丰产竞赛，和其他地区一样，是在抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育基础上开展起来的。过去我们在生产运动中，单纯提出“生产发家，劳动致富”的口号，这对克服农民的农业社会主义思想，鼓舞群众的生产积极性，树立劳动光荣的思想，起了很大作用。但是，这一口号缺乏政治内容，因而不能克服群众中产生的单干思想与干部中产生的退坡思想。今年我们把生产运动与爱国主义结合起来，农村中立即出现了新的气象。群众经过抗美卫国教育与镇压反革命运动，思想觉悟大大提高。农民在“提起美帝想起日本”的痛苦回忆中，十分了解要想安心生产，必须抗美卫国、镇压反革命，即群众自己所说的：“必须刨掉美根、去掉祸根，才能种下富根”。因而，群众开始体会到：自己的生产不仅是为了发家致富，同时也是为了巩固祖国。学习李顺达爱国生产双模范，已成为参加竞赛者的一致口号。在竞赛运动中，许多互助组十分注意学习时事，这对继续不断的鼓励爱国热忱，和生产情绪起了决定的作用。正如壶关流泽劳动模范秦宋法说：“我们越学时事，生产劲头越大了。”三个多月的生产竞赛运动，使我们更加体会到“经济建设必须与政治斗争结合”的重要意义。这是今年爱国生产竞赛中的基本经验，也是使爱国生产竞赛持久与巩固的基本动力。
  第三、具体领导，深入检查
    具体领导，深入检查，是开展爱国生产竞赛及保证运动深入持久的重要关键。在今年春季竞赛运动中，我们在这方面已取得初步成绩，同时也发生了不少偏向。
    （一）组织爱国生产竞赛的专门评判委员会，负责指导与评判竞赛。长治专区十余县，召开了互助代表会，讨论布置生产竞赛，拟订了生产竞赛评判委员会组织办法。县、区及参加竞赛的村，都成立了评判委员会。负责指导竞赛运动。参加竞赛的村及互助组，大都订立了本村或本组的生产计划，作为竞赛目标。这不仅有利于生产竞赛的检查推动，对于整个生产运动都有重大意义。但仍有部分地区，只是提出号召，缺乏具体指导，亦未组织评判，使竞赛运动先热后冷，不能贯彻。有些单位只订了全年目标，缺乏季节计划。有些单位只提出要求，缺乏保证条件。上述偏向都会使竞赛流于形式。
    （二）以李顺达为首的大规模的竞赛运动，必须与一个地区为单位的小集团竞赛相结合。各地有名的劳动模范都向李顺达应战，同时又向本地的各个互助组或劳动模范挑战，这样就形成在李顺达的号召鼓励下，以当地群众非常熟习的模范人物为中心的竞赛运动。老区一般以小区为单位（约六、七个村），新区以区或县为单位开展竞赛。左权、武乡等县在小集团竞赛范围内订立了竞赛连环合同，规定一定时期联合检查，互相观摩评比。这就更加巩固了竞赛的热情，使竞赛者之间的相互关系异常密切。这是大规模竞赛运动的基础，只要基础打好，大规模竞赛的评判也就比较容易了。在小集团联合检查中，不仅要检查成绩，而且要吸取经验，学习技术。也有若干地区运用培养典型的指导方式，以劳动模范所在村为基点开展竞赛，定期进行检查。这样可以用先进村的成绩鼓励一般村，用先进村的经验教育一般村。但也有一部分村，只单纯向李顺达挑战，未注意根据当地条件，具体组织竞赛。使竞赛缺乏基础，流于形式。有些人感到李顺达每亩平均产量三七八斤，超过战前水平一倍，因此，缺乏信心，不敢应战，使竞赛运动的开展受到限制。
    （三）发动与领导爱国生产竞赛，应以劳动互助组为主要依托。山西农村竞赛，有百分之九十是在互助组基础上开展起来的。订立爱国公约及生产计划，大部是以互助组为单位。经验证明，必须大量发动组织起来，爱国生产竞赛运动才能更加广泛地开展与巩固持久。当然对于“单干户”的竞赛，同样应当加以领导，不能把“单干户”关在爱国生产竞赛门外。特别是对于某些技术能手、丰产能手以及专门业务（如林牧水利等）者，更应注意，以培养树立不同地区不同行业的典型与方向。但大规模的竞赛运动，只有在组织起来的基础上才有可能。同时，爱国生产竞赛运动，也有力地推动了组织起来更进一步的发展。有些地区在生产竞赛中，未注意组织互助组。因而竞赛运动亦表现消沉。
    （四）劳动模范是爱国生产竞赛的带头人，也是领导竞赛的骨干。去年出席全省劳动模范会议及各县劳动模范会议的大部分代表，都卷入了生产竞赛，并成为竞赛运动的核心。在竞赛运动中，又涌现了新的大批的生产积极分子与劳动模范。有些地区在春播中结合检查竞赛，评选了劳动模范与模范互助组。结果，今年各地培养模范互助组、生产模范村的运动，就与爱国生产竞赛运动结合在一起了。
  第四、总结春季竞赛，开展夏季竞赛
    春季爱国主义生产竞赛已经告一段落。根据现有报告材料，已有二千多个互助组进行了评比总结，选举了模范，并提出了夏季竞赛的内容与条件，对夏季竞赛做了新的发动。在总结的方法上，大都是以互助组为单位，先由户到组检查，再以小集团或小区为单位，组织联合观摩及联合评比。陵川等县并以互助组代表会的形式，总结了全县的爱国丰产竞赛运动。五月二十日前后，李顺达开始向全国报告春季生产成绩，接着全省便展开了评比总结。襄垣八十三个互助组以“比爱国、比互助、比领导、比技术、比成绩”等五个标准，进行检查总结。这八十三个互助组，都实现了原计划要求，并有六十四个组超过了计划。在评比总结当中，除肯定了成绩，批判了缺点以外，并总结了成功的经验，如陵川、壶关在竞赛中采取“短计划、勤检查”的办法，推动了运动。
    各地均在总结春季竞赛的基础上，布置了夏季竞赛。襄垣提出了十项夏季工作计划，这个计划继续持久深入反美爱国思想教育，完成夏季生产任务，锄苗追肥，除虫防害，订立护麦公约保卫夏收等为主要内容。其它各地亦均提出夏季竞赛具体目标及保证条件。但从目前看，开展夏季部赛还必须注意以下几个问题：首先是深入落后区争取平衡发展。竞赛运动的规模在全省说来虽是空前的，但仍有不少地区，尚未卷入运动。其主要原因是没有进行深入的抗美援朝爱国思想，没有注意组织起来与培养生产积极分子。有些地区孤立地进行抗美援朝宣传教育与镇压反革命工作，没有把群众的反美爱国热潮组织到生产竞赛上来。因此，在夏季生产竞赛中，领导上必须有计划地组织力量，深入落后区，进行具体的帮助，使爱国生产竞赛广泛开展。其次是继续克服形式主义，纠正少数干部代替包办现象，及只做一般号召，不做具体领导，不检查不总结的缺点。上述现象必须在夏季生产竞赛中予以克服。再次是生产竞赛中的命令主义与锦标主义在个别地区仍然存在，亦应注意纠正并严防其继续发生。
