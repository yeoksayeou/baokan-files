Xinhua News Agency, June 6th dispatch from Moscow by TASS: The Soviet working people are actively launching a socialist emulation drive, striving to fulfill this year's production plan and orders for communist construction projects ahead of schedule.

    Miners in Donbass, Kuznetsk, Karaganda, Moscow, and many other coal-producing areas in the Soviet Union have written to Stalin, guaranteeing to produce more than 2.5 million tons of coal above this year's plan. Advanced miners in the Rostov region have already overfulfilled the plan by producing approximately fifty trainloads of coal. Miners of the "Kemerovo Coal Trust" have also overfulfilled the plan by producing dozens of trainloads of coal. In the "Vostsibugol Coal Trust," three mines alone, having completed their five-month production plan ahead of schedule, produced more than 30,000 tons of coal. Miners of the "Chelyabinsk Coal Trust" completed their five-month plan four days ahead of schedule.

    Workers at the Kuznetsk Steel Plant, Magnitogorsk Factory, and Stalino Factory have pledged to produce more than 100,000 tons of pig iron and 80,000 tons of steel above this year's targets. Steelworkers at the Kuznetsk Steel Plant adopted a rapid method, smelting more than 100 heats of steel in May, overfulfilling the plan by producing a large quantity of steel. The metallurgical departments of the Magnitogorsk Factory and the open-hearth furnace operators of the Stalino Factory have both completed their five-month production plans ahead of schedule.

    In all machine tool factories and other factories manufacturing hydroelectric station equipment in the Soviet Union, production emulation is being carried out enthusiastically. Workers at the Leningrad "Elektrosila" Factory spent only two and a half months manufacturing the first hydraulic generator for the Tsimlyanskaya Hydroelectric Station, breaking the production time record. The Baku Electrical Machine Factory has already transported the electric motors and transformers produced ahead of schedule to the construction zone.

    Xinhua News Agency, June 7th dispatch from Moscow by TASS: The Soviet Union is building new cities in the communist construction project areas. Near the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River, the construction of a modern city is being accelerated. Forests have already been planted around the city, and many ancient trees have been planted in the city, transplanted from the reservoirs and waterways under construction. On the outskirts of the city, along the Volga and Akhtuba Rivers, an orchard covering 200 hectares has been established, and many apple, pear, plum, apricot, and cherry trees have been planted this spring. The city will be named "Piatimorsk" (meaning "City of Five Seas"), and in the future, ships from the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the White Sea will be able to moor here.

    A new city is being built near the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. The central square and many public buildings of the city face the Volga River. A huge cultural and recreational park with a water sports field will also be built in the city.

    A new city is also being built next to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station on the Dnieper River. Apartment buildings and public buildings will occupy 120 hectares of land. A water sports field will be established in the scenic area on the banks of the Dnieper River, and a botanical garden will be established near the Kakhovka Reservoir.

    At Takhia-Tash, the starting point of the Turkmen Main Canal, a new city is under construction, and many houses have already been built. The second power station has been completed, and brick kilns and woodworking factories are being built. Vasikovski, Director of the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet Academy of Architecture, and academician Baranov of the Academy of Architecture have arrived in Takhia-Tash to work on the design of new residential areas along the Turkmen Main Canal.

    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：苏联劳动人民积极开展社会主义竞赛，争取提前完成今年的生产计划和共产主义建设工程的定货。
    顿巴斯、库兹涅茨克、卡拉干达、莫斯科和苏联其他许多产煤地区的矿工，都已写信给斯大林，保证要超过今年计划多生产二百五十多万吨煤。罗斯多夫区的先进矿工们已经超计划生产了约五十列车的煤。“基米罗伏采煤托拉斯”的矿工也超计划生产了几十列车的煤。在“伏斯齐布采煤托拉斯”，单是三个提前完成五个月生产计划的矿坑就多生产了三万多吨煤。“车里雅宾斯克采煤托拉斯”的矿工们提前四天完成了五个月的计划。
    库兹涅茨克炼钢厂、马格尼托高尔斯克工厂和斯大林诺工厂的工人，已提出保证要超过今年的目标多生产十万多吨生铁和八万吨钢。库兹涅茨克炼钢厂的炼钢工人采用快速的方法，在五月间炼钢一百多炉，超计划生产了大量的钢。马格尼托高尔斯克工厂的冶金部门和斯大林诺工厂的马丁炉司炉都已提前完成了五个月的生产计划。
    在苏联一切工作母机制造厂和其他制造水电站装备的工厂中，生产竞赛正在热烈地开展着。列宁格勒“电力”工厂的工人只花费两个半月的时间，就为齐姆良斯卡雅水电站制造出第一架水力发电机，打破了生产时间的记录。巴库电机工厂已把提前生产出来的电动机和变压器运往建设地带。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联正在共产主义建设工程地区建设新的城市。在伏尔加河上的斯大林格勒水电站附近，一座现代化城市的建设工作正在加速进行。城市周围已经种起了树林，市内也种上了许多古树，这些树是从建造中的水池、水道那里移植来的。在市郊的伏尔加河和阿赫杜巴河沿岸已经开辟了占地两百公顷的果园，今年春天已经种上了许多苹果树、梨树、李树、杏树和樱桃树。这座城市将命名为“碧雅蒂摩尔斯克”（意思是“五海之城”），将来从黑海、亚速海、里海、波罗的海和白海来的船只都可以在这里碇泊。
    古比雪夫水电站附近正在建设一座新城市。城市的中央广场和许多公共建筑物都面对伏尔加河。市内还要建筑一个有水上运动场的巨大的文化休息公园。
    在第聂伯河上的卡霍夫卡水电站旁边，也在建设一座新城市。公寓大厦和公共建筑物所占的地面将达一百二十公顷。在第聂伯河岸风光明媚的地方将开辟水上运动场，在卡霍夫卡蓄水池附近要建立植物园。
    在土库曼大运河的发源处塔赫亚·塔什，一座新城市在建设着，许多房屋已经建立起来。第二动力站已经落成，砖瓦窑和木器厂正在修建中。苏联建筑科学院列宁格勒分院院长瓦西科夫斯基和建筑科学院院士巴拉诺夫已到达塔赫亚·塔什，从事土库曼大运河沿岸的新城镇住宅区的设计工作。
