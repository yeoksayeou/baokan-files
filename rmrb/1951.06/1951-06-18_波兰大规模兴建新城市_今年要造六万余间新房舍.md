Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 15th: According to the Polish News Agency, new cities and residential areas are being built on a large scale throughout Poland. This is part of the Six-Year Plan. This year, construction is underway in 543 locations across the country, with plans to build 62,000 new houses with a total volume of 16 million cubic meters. It must be pointed out that last year, the original plan was to build 53,000 houses, but the actual number built reached 81,140.

New towns are being built in the two new industrial areas of Nowa Huta and Tychy. In addition, the central areas of twenty-one cities are being rebuilt. In ten industrial cities, including Lodz, Krakow, and Gdansk, the former workers' districts are also being rebuilt. Fifty-six new residential areas are under construction in several cities. Within these new residential areas and towns, fifty-two nurseries, twenty-eight infant rooms, thirty-seven health stations, and more than five hundred retail stores will be opened. In these newly constructed towns and residential areas, there are no dark courtyards, no uninhabitable attics, or damp basements. All houses are equipped with running water and electrical facilities, and the vast majority of houses also have gas facilities.

    今年要造六万余间新房舍
    【新华社十五日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰全国各地正大规模兴建新的城市和住宅区。这是六年计划的一部分。今年全国有五百四十三个地方在兴工建筑，计划要建造六万二千间新房舍，总容积一千六百万立方公尺。必须指出的是：去年原计划造房五万三千间，结果却造成了八万一千一百四十间。
    在诺瓦·胡塔和蒂齐两个新工业区，正在建设新的市镇。此外有二十一个城市的中心区正在重建中。在罗兹、克拉科和革但斯克等十个工业城市，从前的工人区也正在重建。在若干城市里正在建筑五十六个新住宅区。在这些新住宅区和市镇内，将开设五十二个托儿所，二十八个育婴室，三十七个保健站和五百多个零售店。在这些新建设的市镇和住宅区里，没有阴暗的院子，没有不宜居住的顶楼或是阴湿的地下室。所有的房屋都装设有自来水和电气设备，绝大多数的房屋还有煤气设备。
