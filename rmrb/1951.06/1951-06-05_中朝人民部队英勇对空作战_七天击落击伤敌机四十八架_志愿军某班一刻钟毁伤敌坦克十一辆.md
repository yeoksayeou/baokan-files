Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 4th: The Sino-Korean People's Forces continue to fight heroically against enemy aircraft. According to incomplete statistics, from May 22nd to 28th, a total of forty-eight enemy planes were shot down or damaged. Among the thirty-four enemy planes shot down, there were sixteen fighters, six bombers, two helicopters, and ten other types of aircraft. Among the fourteen enemy planes damaged, there were ten fighters, one bomber, and three other types of aircraft. The Sino-Korean People's Forces also captured three enemy pilots.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 2nd: The Fourth Squad of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army destroyed or damaged eleven enemy tanks in fifteen minutes on the highway under Tianfeng Mountain, north of Uijeongbu, with no casualties to the squad. The higher leadership organs have specially awarded the squad the honorary title of "Tank-Fighting Hero Squad."

On the morning of March 27th, Squad Leader Lei Baosheng of the Fourth Squad accepted the task of intercepting enemy tanks and immediately convened his comrades to study how to divide the work of fighting the tanks, and then led all the warriors of the squad into the position. They waited until 3:00 p.m., when twelve enemy tanks and a jeep carrying three enemy soldiers crawled from north to south. When this group of iron tortoises entered the ambush position of the squad, Deputy Squad Leader Huang Zhisheng fired a burst of machine gun fire as a signal, and Squad Leader Lei Baosheng took off his cotton coat, took off his hat, and stood up with four anti-tank grenades in his hands, shouting, "Comrades, charge!" Then he jumped out of the fortifications and went straight to the enemy tank group, throwing a grenade at each of the second and third tanks. Both tanks were blown up and could not move. Wang Guoming and Zhou Shiwu, who were following closely behind him, added a grenade each to the rear and tracks of the two tanks, completely destroying them. These two destroyed tanks blocked the escape route of the tanks behind, and except for the first tank that escaped, the rest panicked and ran around in circles. At this time, Yuan Dehe, Yan Xieguang, Liang Xinfa, Yin Mingguang, and other four warriors who were ambushing in another place also rushed out. They pounced on the enemy's tanks and quickly approached them, making it impossible for their firepower to be brought into play. The enemy soldiers in the jeep fired pistols at the warriors who were approaching the tanks, but Lei Baosheng and Wang Guoming's two anti-tank grenades blew the jeep to pieces.

After fifteen minutes of fierce fighting, eleven enemy tanks were paralyzed on the highway and could not move. The tracks of four tanks were blown off, and the rear of the remaining tanks had been blown open with one or more large holes.

Soon, the enemy in Uijeongbu sent a company to rescue this tank team, which had been almost completely wiped out. The warriors who had finished fighting the tanks hid in the position, waiting to fight the enemy infantry again. When the enemy blindly broke into the warriors' firepower network, the warriors fired a burst of machine guns, submachine guns, and grenades, and the enemy left more than thirty corpses and fled in defeat.

At dusk, all the warriors of the squad returned to their own position victoriously, without any casualties. Their outstanding achievements have been praised by all the comrades in the army.

　　中朝人民部队英勇对空作战
    七天击落击伤敌机四十八架
    志愿军某班一刻钟毁伤敌坦克十一辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】中朝人民部队继续英勇地对空作战。自五月二十二日至二十八日，据不完全统计，敌机共被击落、击伤四十八架。在被击落的三十四架敌机中，有战斗机十六架，轰炸机六架，直升飞机二架，其他型种飞机十架。被击伤的十四架敌机中有战斗机十架，轰炸机一架，其他型种飞机三架。中朝人民部队并捕获敌驾驶员三名。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二日电】中国人民志愿军某部第九连第四班在议政府以北天峰山下的公路上以十五分钟时间击毁、击伤了敌军坦克十一辆，全班无一伤亡。上级领导机关为此特授予该班“打坦克英雄班”的光荣称号。
    三月二十七日上午，第四班班长雷宝生接受了截击敌军坦克的任务，立即召集他的战友们研究了分工打坦克的办法，然后带着全班勇士进入了阵地。一直等到下午三点钟，十二辆敌人的坦克和一辆坐着三个敌兵的吉普车，从北向南爬来了。当这群铁乌龟进到该班预伏阵地时，副班长黄智生打出了一梭子机枪，作为讯号，班长雷宝生就脱去棉衣，摘下帽子，提着四颗反坦克手雷站了起来，大喊一声：“同志们上啊！”接着便跳出工事，直奔敌坦克群，对准了第二、第三两辆坦克各投去一颗手榴弹。这两辆坦克都被炸得不能开动了。紧跟在他后面的王国明、周士武又向这两辆坦克的尾部和履带中各补上一颗手雷，彻底击毁了它。这两辆被击毁了的坦克，挡住了后面坦克的逃路，除第一辆坦克逃跑外，其余的都慌得团团乱转。这时，预伏在另处的袁德和、严斜光、梁新发、印明光等四勇士也冲了出来。他们猛扑敌人的坦克，并且迅速地贴近了它们，使它们的火力无法发扬。坐在吉普车上的敌兵，用手枪向逼近坦克的勇士们射击，但是雷宝生和王国明的两颗反坦克手雷把这辆吉普车炸得粉碎。
    激战十五分钟以后，敌军的十一辆坦克都瘫痪在公路上不能动弹，其中四辆坦克履带被炸断，其余的坦克尾部都被炸开了一个以上的大洞。
    不久，议政府的敌人派了一个连赶来救援这支已经几乎全军覆没的坦克队。打完了坦克的勇士们，隐伏在阵地里，等着再打敌人的步兵。当敌人昏头昏脑地闯进了勇士们的火力网内时，勇士们打去一阵机枪、冲锋枪和手榴弹，敌人丢下三十多具死尸溃逃了。
    黄昏时，全班勇士胜利地回到了本阵地，无一伤亡。他们的杰出战绩得到了全军战友们的赞扬。
