To launch the people of the whole country to establish patriotic pacts and conscientiously implement them is a major step in continuing to deepen and expand the movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend the country. The China Peace Committee has called on the people from all walks of life across the country to universally promote the patriotic pact movement, which is an important form of combining the common activities of people from all social strata.

After more than eight months of the vigorous movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend the country, especially after the nationwide anti-American patriotic demonstrations and parades on May 1st International Labor Day, the political awareness of the people of the whole country has been generally improved, and the patriotic enthusiasm to resist imperialism has been greatly developed. The revolutionary enthusiasm for consolidating national defense, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and developing industrial and agricultural production has been unprecedentedly high. The current task is to continue to deepen and expand this movement, to regularize current affairs and political education, to consolidate and improve the political awareness of the masses, and to actively guide them to bring their patriotic enthusiasm and strength into various concrete practical works, transforming it into material strength, and enhancing the motherland in all aspects. This is the common demand of the people of the whole country, and it is also the unshirkable responsibility of the Party, the government, and people's organizations. And launching the masses to universally establish and conscientiously implement patriotic pacts is precisely one of the effective methods to achieve the above-mentioned goals and tasks.

The establishment of patriotic pacts is a method created by the masses themselves in this movement to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and defend the country, to express their patriotic determination and patriotic actions. This initiative of the masses has profound revolutionary significance. It further unites patriotic people from all walks of life in action and will promote the accelerated advancement of our country's revolutionary struggles and construction work. The patriotic pact is established by the masses consciously and voluntarily. It concentrates the people's will to fight against imperialism and patriotism, consolidates this will to fight and enthusiasm in the form of a pact, and turns it into practical actions of patriotic revolution. The masses establishing patriotic pacts is to establish a program and plan of struggle for resisting imperialism and patriotism. Everyone acts in accordance with the pact, and completes a certain range of patriotic tasks within a certain period, which will converge into an incomparably huge force and make many contributions to the country. Through the form of the patriotic pact, the individual patriotic activities of the masses are actually linked to the overall political struggle of our country. Under the call of the country's overall struggle goals, the masses establish patriotic pacts, so that their patriotic enthusiasm has been properly developed; and the completion of the country's political tasks and construction plans is fully guaranteed because of the support of countless patriotic pacts from the masses. At the same time, since the establishment of the patriotic pact is based on the conscious and voluntary participation of each signatory, and after democratic discussion, it is fixed in the form of clauses, becoming a plan and discipline that a certain group must jointly abide by, it is convenient for the masses to supervise and inspect each other, and it is entirely possible to be consciously and voluntarily implemented by each signatory. Therefore, as long as a serious attitude is adopted during the signing, and diligent inspection is carried out afterwards, every item of the patriotic pact can be fulfilled.

Because the patriotic pact has such a huge revolutionary role and is likely to be fully realized, we should greatly promote and popularize this revolutionary and creative move of the masses. Some places have already established patriotic pacts, and some places have not yet established patriotic pacts. Those that have not been established should be established quickly; those that have already been established should be inspected. All democratic parties, government agencies, and people's organizations across the country should seize this opportunity of the unprecedented upsurge of the national anti-imperialist patriotic fervor and launch the masses to universally establish patriotic pacts. The masses who have already established pacts should re-establish them every six months in the future, on the one hand to check and summarize the implementation of the pact in the past, and at the same time to revise and supplement the content of the pact. Our Party and government should regard launching the people to universally establish and conscientiously implement patriotic pacts as a regular, important task and leadership method. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and government workers should play a leading and exemplary role in establishing and implementing patriotic pacts.

So, how to do a good job in establishing patriotic pacts and ensure their implementation?

First, it is necessary to go deep into the lower-level masses, lead them to establish patriotic pacts within the scope of various smaller units, and make sure that everyone participating in the pact has specific tasks and methods as much as possible. In the past, the patriotic pacts established in various places represented a relatively large scope. Some were based on regions, such as patriotic pacts of people from all walks of life in a province, a city, or a county; some were based on a certain class or a certain profession, such as patriotic pacts of workers, peasants, youth, women, industrial and commercial circles, and religious circles; some were patriotic pacts established by representatives representing the masses they contacted, such as the patriotic pact of the Labor Model Congress. These patriotic pacts all have a certain representativeness and played a certain political appeal and promotion role. However, precisely because they represent too wide a range, the content of the pacts is inevitably abstract and empty, and often cannot be checked. Therefore, although this large-scale patriotic pact should continue to exist, it is more important to go deep into the masses from all walks of life and launch them to establish patriotic pacts according to their own actual situations in units such as a factory, a rural village, a school, an agency, a street, a workshop, a production team, a mutual aid group, a study group, or a courtyard. Only in this way can the patriotic pacts established within the scope of small units be fully and concretely implemented, and checked on schedule to ensure 100% realization.

Second, the content of the patriotic pact must be practical, specific, and concise. It should not be too abstract or too complicated, so that everyone can remember and recite it, and every item can be actually done. Things that cannot be done, or requirements that are too trivial, should not be written on the pact. The content of the patriotic pact is nothing more than three aspects: one is political, such as supporting the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and national defense work, assisting the government in eliminating traitors and counter-revolutionaries, quickly handing over grain and paying taxes, and cherishing public property; one is production or work, such as completing production plans on schedule, saving raw materials, and doing a good job in their respective positions; one is learning, such as learning political, cultural, and technical skills, promoting science, and opposing superstition. However, all of these aspects of content should be specified by the signatories according to their specific circumstances and actual business. The patriotic pacts of people in different regions, different classes, and different professions, although the general direction and spirit are the same, should have different specific content, and should never be the same. At the same time, only those main tasks to be done and the main problems to be solved within a certain period should be stipulated, and do not try to be all-inclusive and want to do everything well at the same time. The patriotic pact established by all members of the Majiazhuang Farmers Association in a township in Xi'an is relatively good. That pact has only four articles in total, namely: "1. Organize men and women to change work, guarantee two hoeings of wheat, and also help families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers, and help families with no manpower or less manpower. 2. Respond to the government's decision to ban Yiguandao and ensure that no bad people are harbored in the village. 3. Ensure that each household plants five trees, and at the same time complete the tree planting task of the Fenghui East Branch Canal. 4. Deliver public grain on time in 1951, ensure that the wheat kernels are clean, and enter the warehouse on time." All these four articles are practical and feasible, and farmers can easily remember them. But some places are not like this. They regard the establishment of patriotic pacts as drafts of declarations and telegrams in the old society, and write down all the beautiful slogans, but in fact there is no specific content. Some places also think that the more detailed the pact is, the better, and list all the unimportant details, resulting in as many as eight major articles and fifty-five detailed rules. Such patriotic pacts cannot be well implemented. We must pay attention to avoiding these two types of problems in establishing patriotic pacts in the future.

Third, the establishment of patriotic pacts should be fully brewed and discussed in advance, and should be solemnly announced afterwards. Naturally, it is necessary for each contracting unit to carry out top-down appeals and mobilizations in advance, explaining the meaning and methods of establishing patriotic pacts. However, the establishment of patriotic pacts is a conscious and voluntary action of the masses, so it must be democratically discussed and decided by the contractors, and no one is allowed to force orders or take over. The contractors can discuss why they want to establish a patriotic pact, what content to stipulate. Anything that cannot be done should not be stipulated, and those who do not agree can also not participate. The more democratic this discussion is, the better. It should universally solicit the opinions of each participant and repeatedly consult. Because only the significance of the signing is fully understood by everyone, and every article in the pact is fully agreed by each participant, ensuring that it can be done on schedule, can the established patriotic pact truly be effective. After the pact is established, it is solemnly announced, or a meeting is held to read it out in public, or it is posted on the wall to inform the public, which can cause the contractors to pay attention to the patriotic pact, supervise each other's implementation, and promote those who have not yet signed to step up the signing. There are many benefits. We must treat the establishment of patriotic pacts as a solemn matter.

Fourth, after the patriotic pact is established, it should be checked and summarized regularly, and constantly supplemented and revised. Our patriotic pact is not an official document, but a program of action agreed upon by the public. Therefore, it must not be shelved, but should be checked regularly for its implementation. If the result of the inspection reveals that the pact has not been seriously implemented, the reasons should be studied and corrected in time; if the tasks stipulated in the pact have been exceeded, it should be considered whether it is necessary to supplement new content; if the objective circumstances and subjective conditions have changed, and the original patriotic pact proves that a part or all of it is no longer suitable, it must be democratically discussed and revised or re-established. Our patriotic pact is not immutable, it should be time-sensitive, and can progress with the development of our times and work. We advocate that people from all walks of life re-establish patriotic pacts every six months, so that on the one hand, each patriotic pact has its fixed period of execution, so that it does not become a dead letter; at the same time, it also allows the patriotic pact to constantly gain new vitality. Regularly establishing patriotic pacts and setting up struggle goals will promote us to persist in our efforts, strive for self-improvement, and will greatly benefit the contractors themselves and our motherland.

　　（一）广泛订立并认真执行爱国公约
    发动全国人民订立爱国公约，并认真地加以贯彻实施，是今后继续深入和扩大抗美援朝反帝爱国运动的一个主要步骤。中国人民抗美援朝总会，已号召全国各地各界人民普遍推行爱国公约运动，这是结合各阶层人民共同活动的一种重要形式。
    经过八个多月轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，尤其是五一国际劳动节的全国规模的全民性的反美爱国大示威游行以后，全国人民的政治觉悟普遍提高，反帝爱国热情大为发扬，巩固国防、巩固人民民主专政、发展工农业生产的革命积极性空前高涨。当前的任务是继续深入和扩大这个运动，使时事政治教育经常化，巩固和提高人民群众的政治觉悟，并积极地引导他们把爱国的热情和力量发挥到各种具体的实际工作中去，变成物质力量，从各方面来增强祖国。这是全国人民的普遍要求，也是党、政府和人民团体的义不容辞的责任。而发动人民群众普遍订立并认真执行爱国公约，就正是实现上述目的和任务的有效方法之一。
    订立爱国公约，是人民群众在这次抗美援朝运动中，自己创造出来，用以表示爱国决心和爱国行动的一种方法。人民群众的这一个创举，具有深刻的革命意义，它使各阶层的爱国人民更进一步地在行动上团结起来，并将推动我们国家的革命斗争和建设工作的加速度前进。爱国公约是由人民群众自觉自愿地订立的。它集中了人民群众反帝爱国的斗争意志和斗争热情，把这种斗争意志和斗争热情以公约形式加以巩固，并使之变成爱国革命的实际行动。人民群众订立爱国公约，就是为自己树立一个反帝爱国的奋斗纲领和计划。人人按照公约执行，在一定时期内完成一定范围的爱国任务，就将汇成无比巨大力量，给国家作出很多贡献。通过爱国公约这一形式，实际上把人民群众的个人的爱国活动和我们国家的总的政治斗争联结起来了。人民群众在国家总的奋斗目标的号召之下，订立爱国公约，使自己的爱国积极性得到了正当的发挥；而国家的政治任务和建设计划的完成，因为得到人民群众无数种爱国公约的支持，而有了充分的保证。同时，由于爱国公约的订立，出于每个订约者的自觉自愿，在经过民主讨论以后，又以条文形式固定下来，成为某一集群必须共同遵守的计划和纪律，它就便于人民群众相互督促和检查，并完全有可能被每个订约者所自觉自愿地执行。因此，只要在订约时采取认真严肃态度，事后又勤于检查，爱国公约的每一项目就都可以兑现。
    正因爱国公约具有如此巨大的革命作用，而又有可能完全实现，所以，我们对于人民群众这种革命的创造性的举动，应该大大地加以发扬和推广。现在有些地方已订立了爱国公约，有些地方还没有订立爱国公约。凡是没有订立的，应该赶紧订立；凡是已经订立的，应该进行检查。全国各民主党派、各政府机关和各人民团体，应该抓紧这个全国反帝爱国热潮空前高涨的时机，发动人民群众普遍订立爱国公约。凡是已经订立公约的群众，今后应该每半年重订一次，一方面检查和总结过去执行公约的情形，同时修正和补充公约的内容。我们的党和政府，应该把发动人民普遍订立和认真执行爱国公约，作为经常的、重要的工作任务和领导方法。共产党员、青年团员和政府工作人员应该在订立和执行爱国公约中起带头作用和模范作用。
    那末，怎样做好订立爱国公约工作，并使它贯彻执行呢？
    第一，要深入到下层人民群众中去，领导他们以各种较小单位为范围订立爱国公约，尽可能做到参加公约的每个人都有具体的任务和作法。过去各地方订立的爱国公约，所代表的范围都比较大。有以地区为单位的，如一省、一市，一县各界人民的爱国公约；有以某一阶层或某一职业为单位的，如工人、农民、青年、妇女、工商界、宗教界的爱国公约；有代表人物代表他们所联系的群众所订立的爱国公约，如劳动模范代表大会的爱国公约等。这种爱国公约都有一定的代表性，并起了一定的政治上的号召和推动作用。但是，正因为它们所代表的范围过广，所订公约内容就不免抽象、空泛，往往无法检查。所以，现在这种大范围的爱国公约固然应当继续存在，但更重要的是要深入各界人民群众，发动他们以一个工厂、一个农村、一个学校、一个机关、一条街道、一个车间、一个生产组、一个互助组、一个学习组、一个院子为单位，按照各自的实际情况订立爱国公约。只有这样以小单位为范围所订立的爱国公约，才可能全部具体执行，并按期实行检查，保证百分之百的实现。
    第二，爱国公约的内容必须切实、具体、简明，不要太抽象，也不要太繁杂，使得人人都能记忆背诵，条条都可实际做到。做不到的事情，或太过于琐碎的要求，不要写到公约上面去。爱国公约的内容不外三个方面，一是政治的，如支援抗美援朝斗争和国防工作，协助政府除奸反特务，迅速交粮纳税，爱护公共财产等；一是生产的或工作的，如按期完成生产计划，节省原材料，做好各自岗位上的工作等；一是学习的，如学习政治文化技术，提倡科学，反对迷信等。但所有这些方面的内容，订约者都应该根据自己的具体情况和实际业务，把它具体化。不同地区、不同阶层、不同职业的人民爱国公约，虽然总的方向和精神是一致的，但应各有不同的具体内容，而决不应千篇一律。同时，应该只把那些在一定时期内要做的主要任务和要解决的主要问题订上去，而不要色色具备，样样都想在同一时间内做好。西安市一乡马家庄农会全体会员所订立的爱国公约就比较好。那个公约总共只有四条，即：“一、组织男女变工，保证锄麦两次，还要帮助烈、军、工属，帮助没有人手或人手少的家户。二、响应政府取缔一贯道的决定，保证村里不窝藏坏人。三、保证每户植树五棵，同时还要完成沣惠东支渠的植树任务。四、一九五一年公粮按时缴送，保证麦颗干净，按时入仓。”所有这四条都切实可行，农民也容易记住。但有的地方不是这样，他们把订立爱国公约，当作旧社会的草宣言发通电，把一切漂亮的口号都写了上去，实际上毫无具体内容。也有的地方以为公约越详细越好，把一切无关紧要的细枝末节都列上，以致多至八大条，五十五细则。这样的爱国公约都是无法很好执行的。我们今后在订立爱国公约时，务须注意避免这两类毛病。
    第三，爱国公约的订立，事先应经过充分的酝酿讨论，事后应加以郑重公布。自然，各订约单位事先进行由上而下的号召和动员，说明订立爱国公约的意义和方法，是必要的。但订立爱国公约是人民群众自觉自愿的行动，因此必须由订约者进行民主讨论和决定，决不允许别人强迫命令或包办代替。订约者可以讨论为什么要订立爱国公约，订些什么内容。凡是做不到的应该不订，不同意的也可不参加。这种讨论要越民主越好，应该普遍地征求每个参加订约者的意见，并反复地进行磋商。因为只有订约的意义为大家所充分了解，公约中的每一条文为每个参加订约者所完全同意，保证能够按期做到，所订立的爱国公约才能真正发生效能。在公约订定以后，予以隆重公布，或召开大会当众宣读，或张贴墙上告示大众，可以引起订约者对爱国公约的重视，相互督促执行，并推动未订约者加紧订立，是有很多好处的。我们必须把订立爱国公约当作一件郑重的事情来做。
    第四，爱国公约订立以后，应该定期进行检查和总结，并不断地加以补充和修正。我们的爱国公约，不是什么官样文章，而是公众议定的行动纲领，因此，决不能置之高阁，而应该经常地检查它的执行情况。如果检查的结果，发现公约未被认真执行，就应研究原因，及时改正；如果公约中规定的任务，已被超过，就要考虑是否需要补充新的内容；如果客观情况和主观条件发生了变化，原来的爱国公约证明有一部分或全部已经不合适了，就必须经过民主讨论，进行修正或重订。我们的爱国公约不是一成不变的，它应该是有时间性的，可以随着我们的时代和工作的发展而进步。我们主张各界人民每半年重订一次爱国公约，就是要一方面使每个爱国公约都有它的执行的固定期限，不致成为一纸具文；同时，也使爱国公约可以不断地获得新的生命力。定期订立爱国公约，树立奋斗目标，将推动我们坚持努力，自强不息，对于订约者本人和我们的祖国都是有很大利益的。
