Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 7th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in the last ten days of May, killed or wounded over 4,000 enemy troops, three-quarters of whom were American invading troops.

After the conclusion of the spring counter-offensive by the Chinese and Korean People's forces, the American, British, and other invading forces, along with the Syngman Rhee puppet army, continued to employ the so-called "magnetic tactics" and recklessly advanced northwards along the highways with tanks and motorized units. In order to annihilate the enemy's active forces, the Chinese and Korean People's forces carried out highly mobile operations, and after the counter-offensive, they moved to advantageous areas north of the 38th parallel, awaiting opportunities to annihilate the enemy. When the American and Rhee bandit troops advanced into the no-man's-land south of the 38th parallel, Van Fleet, commander of the US Eighth Army, smugly boasted of his advance as a "pursuit." However, by May 29, the enemy's advance was halted on all fronts by the strong resistance of the Chinese and Korean People's forces. After suffering severe blows from the Chinese and Korean People's forces, Van Fleet was forced to announce in disappointment that his "pursuit" was over.

When the enemy's tanks and motorized units advanced along the highways, the Chinese and Korean People's forces met the enemy on the roadsides and in pre-determined positions in the cities of Linchuan, Yanggu, Chuncheon, and Lianchuan. From May 29 to 31, in addition to carrying out defensive battles on the entire front, the Chinese and Korean People's forces also carried out heroic and intelligent counter-attacks in the northeast and northwest of Linchuan, the northeast and southwest of Huachuan, the north and northeast of Baokcheon, and the southeast and southwest of Lianchuan. In the battles, many model combat units emerged that achieved victories with fewer troops. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army operating in the mountainous area northeast of Baokcheon, at the cost of only 24 casualties in three days, killed, wounded, or captured over 760 American and Canadian soldiers. When a certain unit launched a counter-attack on a certain high ground southeast of Lianchuan, with only three squads, they drove an American company out of the position; the enemy left over 40 bodies and fled in panic. Another unit guarded the Gaolangpu bridgehead position on the north bank of the Imjin River, repeatedly repelling several attempts by the Rhee puppet army to cross the river, killing or wounding over 400 enemy soldiers, while its own casualties were extremely small.

The enemy troops advancing northwards suffered severe casualties. The 25th Division of the American invading forces and the 187th Airborne Regiment suffered particularly heavy losses. According to prisoners, the American 187th Airborne Regiment had already lost over 1,000 troops during its advance into the mountainous area northeast of Linchuan. A captured soldier from the 8th Company of the 24th Regiment of the American 25th Division also said that the 2nd Battalion of the regiment had merged the 5th and 6th Companies into one company due to heavy casualties. The 8th Company had only over 80 people left, and over 30 more were killed or wounded on the 30th alone. The Canadian 25th Brigade, which recently participated in the invasion of Korea, suffered its first heavy blow in the mountainous area northeast of Baokcheon. Among the bodies abandoned by the Canadian army was a battalion commander.

In the ten-day operation, according to incomplete statistics, in addition to killing or wounding over 4,000 enemy troops, the Chinese and Korean People's forces also destroyed 15 enemy tanks and over 60 vehicles.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 7th: The Chinese and Korean People's forces continued to inflict increasingly heavy blows on the enemy troops advancing northwards. From June 1st to 3rd, the Chinese and Korean People's forces annihilated another 3,845 enemy soldiers in stubborn and intelligent resistance.

In these three days, the enemy concentrated its forces and recklessly launched continuous joint land and air attacks on the forward positions of the Chinese and Korean People's forces north and northeast of Yanggu and between Huachuan and Lianchuan, but suffered heavy casualties. At Sangniubang, three kilometers north of Yanggu, and Yangjiawu Village, eight kilometers northeast, the Chinese and Korean People's forces engaged in three days of fierce fighting with the US 1st Marine Division, killing or wounding 510 enemy soldiers, shooting down seven enemy aircraft, and destroying two enemy tanks. Along the Zhongjun Peak, Jueyi Peak, Mingcheng Mountain, and Poda Peak line northeast of Baokcheon, a certain unit of the Chinese and Korean People's forces bravely resisted the joint land and air attacks by the US 25th Division and the Canadian 25th Brigade, repelling two to five rounds of enemy attacks every day and constantly carrying out counter-attacks, each time killing or wounding a large number of enemies at a very small cost. After killing or wounding over 760 enemy soldiers in the last three days of May, the unit killed, wounded, or captured over 1,350 enemy soldiers in these three days, and destroyed seven enemy tanks and two vehicles. A certain unit of the Chinese and Korean People's forces guarding the Jongjasan Jia Chi Xiang defense line about ten kilometers east of Lianchuan engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the American and Rhee puppet forces, killing or wounding over 500 enemy soldiers. In the Gaolangpu direction on the Imjin River bank on the western front, a unit of the Rhee puppet army once crossed the Jiangbei River, but was driven back to Jiangnan after a counter-attack by the Chinese and Korean People's forces. According to preliminary statistics, the Chinese and Korean People's forces killed, wounded, or captured 1,988 American soldiers, 400 Canadian mercenaries, and 1,457 Rhee puppet soldiers in three days; seized six rocket launchers and fifteen light and heavy machine guns; and shot down nine enemy aircraft, damaged one enemy aircraft, destroyed twelve tanks and four vehicles, and sank two steamships.

　　中朝人民部队高度机动作战
    续歼敌七千八百余名
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在五月份最后十天的作战中，又杀伤了敌军四千人以上，其中四分之三是美国侵略军。
    在中、朝人民部队的春季反击战结束以后，美、英等侵略军和李承晚伪军继续采用所谓“磁性战术”，并以坦克和摩托化部队沿公路向北冒险窜犯。中、朝人民部队为歼灭敌军有生力量，进行高度的机动作战，乃于反击战以后转进到北纬三十八度线以北有利地区，待机歼敌。当美、李匪军在三十八度线以南无人地区窜进时，美第八军军长范佛里特曾沾沾自喜地把他的窜犯行动吹嘘为“穷追战”。可是到了五月二十九日，敌军的窜犯就在全线上遭到中、朝人民部队的坚强阻击而停滞下来了。在遭受了中、朝人民部队的严重打击以后，范佛里特被迫扫兴地宣布他的“穷追战”从此完蛋。
    当敌军坦克及摩托化部队沿公路冒进时，中、朝人民部队就在麟蹄、杨口、春川、涟川等城的公路两侧及预定阵地迎击敌军。自五月二十九日至三十一日，中、朝人民部队除在全线进行阻击战外，并在麟蹄的东北及西北、华川的东北及西南、抱川以北及东北、涟川东南及西南，进行了英勇机智的反击，在作战中并出现了许多以少胜多的模范作战单位。在抱川东北山区作战的志愿军某部，三天中仅以伤亡二十四人的代价，毙伤俘美军及加拿大军七百六十余人。某部在向涟川东南某高地举行反击时，仅以三个班的兵力，即将美军一个连逐出阵地；敌人遗尸四十余具仓惶溃逃。另部扼守临津江北岸高浪浦里桥头阵地，连续击退李伪军数次渡江进攻，杀伤敌军四百余人，自己的伤亡则极为微小。
    向北窜犯的敌军都受到了严重的杀伤。美侵略军的第二十五师、空降第一八七团损失尤重。据俘虏供称：美军空降一八七团在窜犯麟蹄东北山区期间就已损失兵力一千余人。美军二十五师二十四团八连被俘士兵也说：该团第二营因为伤亡重大，已经将第五、六两连合编为一个连。该团第八连只剩八十多人，在三十日一天中又被杀伤了三十多人。最近参加侵略朝鲜战争的加拿大第二十五旅帮凶军，此次在抱川东北山区已经首次受到惨重打击。在加拿大军遗弃的尸体中有营长一名。
    在十天作战中，据不完全统计，中、朝人民部队除杀伤敌军四千多人外，还击毁了敌人的坦克十五辆，汽车六十多辆。
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】中、朝人民部队继续予向北窜犯的敌军以愈来愈重的打击。从六月一日到三日，中、朝人民部队在顽强机智的抗击战中又歼灭敌人三千八百四十五人。
    在这三天中，敌军曾集中兵力冒险向杨口以北及东北、华川至涟川间中、朝人民部队前沿阵地发动陆空联合的连续猛攻，但均遭到惨重杀伤。在杨口以北三公里上牛望及东北八公里杨佳梧村，中、朝人民部队与美军陆战第一师进行了三天的激战，杀伤敌军五百一十名，并击落敌机七架，击毁敌坦克二辆。在抱川东北中军峰、角屹峰、鸣城山、朴达峰一线，中、朝人民部队某部奋勇迎击美军第二十五师和加拿大军第二十五旅的陆空联合猛犯，每日击退敌人二次到五次的轮番进攻，并不断进行反击，每次都是以很小代价杀伤大量敌人。该部继五月份最后三天杀伤敌军七百六十余名后，又在这三天中毙、伤、俘敌一千三百五十余人，并击毁敌军坦克七辆、汽车二辆。扼守涟川以东约十公里的种子山加齿项一线阵地中、朝人民部队某部，与美军及李伪军展开肉搏战，杀伤敌人五百余名。在西线临津江岸高浪浦里方向，李伪军一部曾一度侵越江北，经中、朝人民部队反击后，即被逐回江南。据初步统计，中、朝人民部队在三天中毙、伤、俘美军一千九百八十八人，加拿大帮凶军四百名，李伪军一千四百五十七名；缴获火箭筒六门，轻重机枪十五挺；并击落敌机九架，击伤敌机一架，击毁坦克十二辆、汽车四辆，击沉汽船二艘。
