　　Planned Development of Handicraft Production
　　Wang Yuan
　　North China had a bumper harvest last year, and farmers have basically sold their local products (total value equivalent to about 7 billion jin of raw grain), so farmers' purchasing power has increased significantly. In Shanxi Province, the total surplus of agricultural and sideline production such as grain, cotton, oil, and local mountain products in 1950 was more than 400 million jin compared to 1949, and farmers' purchasing power increased by about 70%. According to a typical survey in Shijiazhuang during the same period, the purchasing power of suburban farmers increased by about 65%. Therefore, farmers urgently need to replace and repair the means of production lost during the long war, and replenish some daily necessities. At present, in the context of underdeveloped machine industry and inconvenient transportation, handicraft production occupies a considerably important position in farmers' production and living needs. According to a survey in Hebei Province, handicrafts account for about 80% of the industrial products purchased by farmers. In some areas, handicraft production is also the main source of income for the masses. For example, there are 29,000 households engaged in handicraft production in Hebei Province, with more than 100,000 employees. The total output value of handicraft production in Shanxi Province accounts for about 20% of the national economy, with about 2 million employees and their dependents relying on it for their livelihood. In Pingyuan Province, in an area with seven counties and 1.4 million people, people rely on weaving straw hat braids for a living. In the second district of Bo'ai County, handicraft production accounts for about 50% of the masses' annual income. Due to the increase in farmers' purchasing power, there is a need for handicrafts. In the past year, handicraft production has been rapidly restored and developed, and the number of households and capital have increased. Some small handicraft producers have even organized joint operations and cooperative production (according to incomplete statistics, there are currently 200 handicraft production groups, 293 production cooperatives, and several cooperative factories in North China). However, this development still cannot keep up with the demand. For example, in Wen County, Meng County, and other six counties in the Xinxiang area, blacksmiths can produce 110,000 pieces of agricultural tools in the five months before wheat harvest, while it is estimated that at least 134,000 additional agricultural tools are needed in these six counties, a shortage of more than 20,000 pieces. At the Handcraft Industry Representative Conference in Anyang County, it was estimated that more than 10,000 plows, drills, and hoes would need to be supplemented in 1951. At the Shan County department store fair, handicraft products such as agricultural tools, wickerwork, woodenware, and pottery were snapped up in half a day. Insufficient supply of industrial products will widen the scissors differential between industrial and agricultural products, directly affecting agricultural production, and farmers will be dissatisfied. Therefore, the planned and organized vigorous restoration and development of handicraft production urgently needed by farmers (while also developing local industry and light industry) is currently a serious task.
　　However, handicraft production itself has many weaknesses and difficulties: 1. Production is scattered. Small capital, shortage of raw materials, few people, and short legs, making it impossible to purchase and sell over long distances. 2. There is a strong seasonality. Sales are good in peak months, but there is insufficient capital, resulting in rough and shoddy production; sales are sluggish in off-peak months, resulting in capital accumulation, preventing smooth production. Producers do not know what is needed in the market and how much is needed, resulting in blindness. 3. Technically, they stick to old ways and do not know how to improve. Product costs are high and quality is low. 4. There are many unreasonable habits and systems in business management. Some people work as long as 18 hours a day. 5. Some "family shops" consume as they produce, without calculating costs or profits and losses, and cannot accumulate capital for expanded reproduction. The above-mentioned weaknesses and difficulties are obstacles to the development of handicraft production. Therefore, we need to pay attention to solving the following problems when guiding handicraft production:
　　　　(1) Clarify the direction of production
　　Handicraft production should serve the production and life of farmers, so it is necessary to rectify, restore, transform, and focus on development according to the needs of farmers' production, life, and agricultural product processing, so that it becomes an assistant to the machine industry. There are many handicrafts that will not be immediately replaced by the machine industry, and some will not be replaced in the future. Therefore, the idea that handicraft production is sporadic, scattered, has many shortcomings, and has no development prospects, and therefore should be left to its own devices, is wrong. However, the development of handicrafts must also adopt different policies according to different sales situations: 1. Those that will not be replaced by the machine industry for the time being or may be coordinated with the machine industry, and are necessary for military and civilian use, such as agricultural tools, handmade pulp, and hand-woven sacks, should be vigorously developed; 2. Those that may be replaced by the machine industry but can still exist at present should be produced according to sales; 3. Local special handicrafts with a history and sales channels should be restored and rectified to improve specifications and reduce costs. Those that were sold abroad in the past should be rectified or reorganized according to the current sales situation; 4. Small coal kilns, logging industries, etc., should be managed by the state according to the principle of not hindering large-scale production in the future; 5. Those that have no sales channels now or in the future should be advised to change careers and should not be blindly developed.
　　　　(2) Strengthen production planning
　　State-owned economy, cooperatives, and state-owned trust companies should assist handicrafts with development prospects as much as possible through methods such as ordering, purchasing, exclusive sales, distribution, commissioned processing, and exchanging raw materials for finished products. The contract period should be as long as possible. Processing tasks should be distributed as planned as possible according to the production capacity of handicraft producers, and processing parties should be able to profit. Where possible and necessary, provide handicraft producers with loans and technical assistance. Under the unified plan of the state, help handicraft producers formulate production and sales plans. The plan should be completely based on the voluntary participation of the masses, starting with typical households, and then concentrating household plans into industry plans. It should not be forced by order, and attention should be paid to checking and revising the plan at any time, and exchanging experiences. When ordering plans, the seasonality of production and sales should be taken into account to enable off-peak production to supply peak-season sales, peak months to accumulate capital for off-peak months, and prevent rough and shoddy production. In this way, the scattered handicrafts can be organized to a certain extent under the leadership of the state-owned economy, strengthening their planning.
　　　　(3) Encourage voluntary joint operations
　　1. For handicraft factories and workshops employing workers, guide them to voluntarily organize joint operations, changing "competitors in the same industry" into "mutually beneficial and mutually helpful." The organizational form of the joint operation should be flexible and diverse according to different requirements, without being constrained by form or scale. Generally, methods such as joint production and joint sales, separate production and joint sales, joint procurement and separate production, and joint production and consignment sales are adopted to organize raw material procurement and open up distant sales channels. Improve the system and business management of the joint operation organization, promote democracy, sign contracts, and rationally distribute raw material or product profits, opposing biases such as "uneven distribution of benefits and burdens," "joint operation in name only," and "joint operation for loans." 2. For independent producers, they should be guided to organize themselves; the cooperative should make this one of its main tasks. Gradually improve handicraft production on the existing basis, with a view to moving towards semi-machine production and modernization. Organizational forms: 1. Rural areas have seasonal sideline occupations and household handicrafts, and production teams can be organized. Supply and marketing cooperatives adopt interlocking contracts to link producers and consumers. 2. Organize production cooperatives, and the production cooperatives will uniformly purchase raw materials and promote products, but production is still carried out in a decentralized manner. At the same time, the supply and marketing cooperative can also be responsible for the supply and sales of raw material products. 3. Cooperative factories, one is developed from handicraft production cooperatives; the other is processing factories assisted by supply and marketing cooperatives, such as sack factories, repair shops, etc. But it should not be universally developed.
　　The above-mentioned forms can more or less overcome some of the blindness in handicraft production and sales, facilitate the acceptance of state orders and commissioned processing, save labor, increase capital turnover, increase production and business strength, improve production technology, appropriately improve specification standards, reduce costs, and accumulate capital, so as to overcome the difficulties of small capital, low technology, high costs, and short legs in handicraft production. However, it must be clearly recognized that handicraft production cooperatives are organizations of independent handicraft producers, and overcome the separation of supply and marketing cooperatives from production cooperatives and the official running of ideas.
　　　　(4) Improve business management
　　At present, most of the handicraft production still has bad rules and habits, and secret recipes are not passed on, hindering technological progress and specification improvement, resulting in some handicraft products not meeting the requirements of farmers. Even raising prices and deceiving farmers. For these handicraft producers, it is necessary to strengthen policy education and establish the view of producing for the needs of farmers. And assist them in improving business, improving technology, achieving good quality and low price, honesty, creating brand names, attracting customers, and overcoming the high-profit idea of ​​"not being on the market for three years, and eating for three years after being on the market." For major products, quality specification standards can be tried out, product inspections can be tried out, or peer reviews can be organized with emphasis.
　　　　(5) Carry out patriotic labor competitions
　　Sign competition contracts through labor-management consultation, cultivate labor models and activists, and promote the development of the movement. During the competition, attention must be paid to ideological mobilization, and competition conditions such as product quality, model standards, reward methods, and patriotic covenants should be appropriately proposed. Labor competitions must be carried out steadily and continuously, preventing biases such as "emphasizing quantity over quality" and "a gust of wind" in the movement.
　　　　(6) Improve production relations
　　Rely on the working class, establish labor-management consultation meetings, conduct democratic consultations based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management, sign collective contracts, and reform the feudal management system. Laborers should also establish new labor attitudes. Sign apprenticeship contracts, eliminate feudal conservative ideas, and promote respect for teachers and love for apprentices to spread experience and improve technology. Normalize and institutionalize relations in all aspects to ensure the normal operation of production.
　　　andfeel(7) Strengthen leadership
　　In order to lead handicraft production, many counties in Xinxiang and Anyang areas of Pingyuan Province have held handicraft representative conferences. Before the meeting, investigations and studies were conducted on the requirements of farmers and handicraft producers, and representatives of handicraft producers, farmers, cooperatives, and other relevant financial and economic departments were invited to participate in the meeting. At the meeting, patriotic education was implemented, policies were explained, the ideological concerns of handicraft producers were dispelled, and their enthusiasm for business and expanding investment was inspired. The meeting can also clarify production and sales channels and market demand, so that sellers know the numbers and buyers know the bottom line, and contract transactions can be carried out. Experience has proved that holding a handicraft representative meeting is an important method for leading handicrafts, and it can be promoted.
　　In order to strengthen the leadership of handicraft production, it is also necessary to improve the leadership structure. According to the opinions of various places, the financial and economic committees at all levels should pay attention to leading handicraft production, and the provincial industrial halls and the industrial and commercial sections of the special and county should be the competent institutions for handicraft production. In areas where handicrafts are concentrated, technical specification research and guidance institutions and quality inspection committees can be established under the industrial and commercial departments. At the same time, it should also: 1. Strengthen the leadership function of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and under the Federation of Industry and Commerce, organize special committees according to the common requirements of general industrial and commercial personnel to guide the business of members (such as labor-management, public-private, urban-rural relations, etc. committees). 2. Under the larger industry associations, subgroups should be divided. The government regularly educates members and guides business activities. 3. Organize observation groups to foreign countries or rural areas to broaden the sales channels of handicraft products.

　　有计划地发展手工业生产
    王元
    华北去年丰收，农民又基本上推销完了土产品（总值约合原粮七十亿斤），农民购买力就显著地提高了。山西全省粮食、棉花、油料、山货土产等项农副业生产，一九五○年总剩余量比一九四九年多四亿余斤，农民购买力约提高百分之七十。据同时期石家庄的典型调查，郊区农民购买力约提高百分之六十五。因此，农民就迫切需要添置和修理在长期战争中损失了的生产资料，和添补一些生活用品。目前，在机器工业不发达和交通不够便利的情况下，手工业生产在农民生产、生活需要中占相当重要的地位。据河北省调查，手工业品约占农民所购工业品的百分之八十左右。在某些地区，手工业生产且为群众收入的主要来源。如河北省从事手工业生产的就有二万九千户，从业人员十万余人。山西省手工业生产总值约占国民经济的百分之二十，从业人员及赖以为生者约二百万人。平原省有七个县一百四十万人的地区依编织草帽辫为生。博爱县第二区，手工业生产占群众常年收入的百分之五十左右。由于农民购买力提高，需要手工业品。一年来手工业生产得到了迅速的恢复与发展，户数资金多有增加。有些小手工业者且组织了联营和合作生产（据不完整统计，华北现有二百个手工业生产小组，二百九十三个生产合作社及若干合作工厂）。但这种发展仍赶不上需要。如新乡专区温县、孟县等六县，铁匠炉麦前五个月可生产农具十一万件，而估计该六县至少尚需添置农具十三万四千余件，不足两万余件。安阳县手工业代表会上估计，一九五一年需补充犁、耧、锄一万余件。单县百货大会上，农具、柳编、木器、窑业等手工业品，上市半日即抢购一空。工业品供应不足，将会扩大工、农业产品剪刀差，直接影响农业生产，农民将会不满。因此，有计划、有组织地大力恢复与发展为农民所迫切需要的手工业生产（当然同时也要发展地方工业和轻工业），已是目前严重的任务。
    但是，手工业生产本身存在着不少的弱点和困难：一、生产分散。资金小、原料缺、人手少、腿短，不能作远距离的采购和推销。二、有浓厚的季节性。旺月好销，资金不足，粗制滥造；淡月滞销，资金积压，致生产不能顺畅进行。生产者不知道市场上需要什么和需要多少，有盲目性。三、技术上墨守成规，不知改进。产品成本高，质量低。四、经营管理上存在着许多不合理的习惯和制度。每日工时有长达十八小时者。五、有些“家眷铺”，随生产随消耗，不计成本，不计盈亏，不能积累资金扩大再生产。上述各项弱点和困难都是手工业生产发展的障碍。因此，需要我们在指导手工业生产时注意解决以下问题：
            （一）明确生产方向
    手工业生产应为农民的生产和生活服务，所以要根据农民生产、生活的需要和农产品加工的需要，进行整顿、恢复、改造和重点发展，使之成为机器工业的助手。手工业中有很多不会马上被机器工业所代替，有些在将来也不会被代替。因此，那些认为手工业生产零星、散漫、缺点多，没有发展前途，从而任其自生自灭的思想是不对的。但发展手工业也须根据不同销路情况，采取不同的方针：一、一时不致被机器工业代替或可能与机器工业相配合，且为军需民用所必需者，如农具、手工制浆、手织麻袋等，应大力发展；二、可能被机器工业代替而目前尚能存在者，应按销定产；三、有历史的地方特种手工业，且有销路者，应恢复整顿，提高规格，降低成本。过去外销者，应根据销路现况，进行整顿或改组；四、对小煤窑、伐木业等，根据不妨害将来大规模生产的原则，国家应予以管理；五、现在将来均无销路者，应劝其转业，不应盲目发展。
            （二）加强生产计划性
    国营经济与合作社、公营信托公司应尽可能通过订货、收购、包销、经销、委托加工、以原料换成品等方式，协助有发展前途的手工业。合同期限要尽可能长些。加工任务尽可能按照手工业者生产能力有计划地分配，并使加工者有利可图。在可能与需要的条件下，给手工业者以贷款与技术的帮助。并可在国家统一计划下，帮助手工业者制订产销计划。计划应完全根据群众自愿，先从典型户做起，再集中户计划为行业计划，不能强迫命令，并应注意随时检查、修正计划，交流经验。订计划应切实照顾到产销的季节性，使淡月生产供给旺月销售，旺月为淡月积累资金，防止粗制滥造。这样就可以一定程度地把分散的手工业组织在国营经济的领导下，加强其计划性。
            （三）鼓励自愿合力经营
    一、对雇佣工人的手工工厂、作坊，可指导他们自愿地组织联营，改变“同行冤家”为“互利互助”。联营的组织形式，应根据不同要求，灵活多样，不拘形式，不重规模。一般采取联产联销、分产联售、联购分产及联产代销等方式，组织原料采购和打开远地销路。改进联营组织的制度及经营管理，发扬民主，签订合同，合理分配原料或产品利润，反对“苦甜不均”，“口联心不联”，及“联营为贷款”等偏向。二、对独立生产者，应引导他们组织起来；合作社应以此为其主要工作内容之一。使手工业生产在现有基础上逐步提高，以期走向半机器生产和现代化。组织形式：一、农村中有季节性的副业和家庭手工业，可组织生产小组。供销社采取连环合同，把生产者和消费者联系起来。二、组织生产合作社，统一由生产合作社购买原料和推销产品，但生产仍是分散进行的。同时，也可以由供销社负责原料产品的供销。三、合作工厂，一种是由手工业生产合作社发展而来；一种是供销社所辅设的加工工厂，如麻袋工厂、修车厂等。但不宜普遍发展。
    以上几种形式，都能或多或少地克服一些手工业生产和推销上的盲目性，便于接受国家订货和委托加工，节省人工，提高资金周转率，增加生产经营力量，改进生产技术适当提高规格标准，降低成本，积累资金，以克服手工业生产资金小、技术低、成本高，腿短等困难。但必须明确地认识到手工业生产合作社是独立手工业生产者的组织，并克服供销社和生产合作社不分及官办思想。
            （四）改善经营管理
    目前手工业生产大部分还存在着陋规恶习，及秘诀不传，障碍技术进步和规格改进，致有些手工业产品不合农民要求。甚至抬高价格，欺哄农民。对这些手工业生产者必须加强政策教育，树立为农民需要而生产的观点。并协助其改进经营，提高技术，做到物美价廉，童叟无欺，创牌号，拉主顾，克服“三年不发市，发市吃三年”的高利思想。对主要产品可试行制定质量规格标准，试行产品检验，或组织同行业有重点地评议。
            （五）开展爱国主义劳动竞赛
    通过劳资协商签订竞赛合同，培养劳动模范、积极分子，推动运动发展。竞赛时，须注意思想发动，适当地提出竞赛条件，如产品质量，模范标准、奖励办法及爱国公约等。劳动竞赛必须稳步持续地开展，防止运动中“重量不重质”及“一阵风”的偏向。
            （六）改善生产关系
    依靠工人阶级，成立劳资协商会议，按劳资两利原则进行民主协商，签订集体合同，改革封建管理制度。劳动者亦应树立新的劳动态度。订立师徒合同，革除封建保守观念，提倡尊师爱徒，以传播经验，提高技术。使各方面的关系正常化、制度化、保证生产的正常进行。
            （七）加强领导
    为了领导手工业生产，平原省新乡、安阳专区，很多县都开了手工业代表会。会前对农民与手工业者的要求进行了调查研究，吸收手工业者、农民、合作社及其他有关财政经济部门代表参加会议。会上贯彻爱国主义教育，讲解政策，解除手工业者的思想顾虑，启发其经营的积极性，及扩大投资。会上并可弄清产销路道和市场需求，使卖家有数，买家有底，并可开展合同交易。经验证明：开手工业代表会是领导手工业的重要方法，可以推广。
    为加强手工业生产领导，还须健全领导机构。根据各地意见，各级财政经济委员会应注意领导手工业生产，省工业厅和专、县的工商科应为手工业生产的主管机构。在手工业集中地区，可在工商部门下设立技术规格研究指导机构和质量检查委员会。同时亦应：一、加强工商联合会的领导机能，在工商联合会下，根据一般工商业者的共同要求，组织专门委员会指导会员业务（如劳资、公私、城乡关系等委员会）。二、在较大的行业公会下，应划分小组。政府经常对会员进行教育，指导业务活动。三、组织外地或农村考察团，广开手工业产品销路。
