Afforestation and the Production of People in Mountainous Areas
    Li Fanwu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, Central People's Government

　　Our country's more than 4 billion mu of barren mountains are the main source of various natural disasters. These disasters, year after year, in varying degrees and in different regions, seriously threaten agricultural production, often damaging the crops painstakingly cultivated by millions of farmers to the point of no return due to overwhelming sandstorms, sudden mountain floods, and abrupt hailstorms.

　　These so-called "natural disasters" are not necessarily entirely "natural," but are mainly caused by human factors. Under the rule of the reactionary regime in old China, forests were only destroyed and not constructed, resulting in large-scale devastation of forests. At the same time, the people, subjected to cruel feudal exploitation, had no choice but to flee to the mountain valleys, relying on cutting down trees and reclaiming land to make a living, which further aggravated the destruction of forests and the severity of natural disasters.

　　When the trees are all cut down, only grass is left to cut; when the grass is all cut down, the roots are dug up. As a result, the fertile soil on the mountains gradually loses its cover and is exposed to rainwater erosion. Thus, not only is the soil lost, but even the exposed rocks are increasingly weathered into flying sand, damaging good farmland. Also, because there are no trees and grass on the mountains to conserve water sources, the mountains cannot retain rainwater, and all springs and streams cannot flow continuously, thus easily leading to drought. If there is a heavy rain, rainwater mixed with mud and sand rushes down the valleys without any hindrance, immediately raising the riverbeds, silting up rivers and causing them to overflow and breach their banks, resulting in floods. In summer, the exposed sand and gravel on the mountains are scorched by the fiery sun, and when clouds suddenly come into contact with the high heat, they rise sharply into the cold air, and the water droplets immediately freeze into ice, falling down as hailstorms.

　　This is the reason why "barren mountains are the main source of natural disasters."

　　We know that in the past, natural disasters in China were very serious. Twenty to thirty million mu of farmland suffered from floods and droughts; twenty to thirty million farmers suffered from hunger and displacement. This was already a common occurrence. In the recent thirty years, there has been an average of two poor harvests every three years. This means that more than half of the agricultural harvests were completely swallowed up by natural disasters.

　　"Reclaiming land in the mountains brings disaster to the plains!" This old saying, which has been around for a long time, contains countless painful lessons and bloody historical facts! In fact, the result of reclaiming land in the mountains not only fails to save the lives of the people in the mountainous areas, but also increases disasters to the farmland in the plains.

　　We know that mountainous areas originally have less farmland. After the forests are destroyed, the crops in the mountainous areas are either withered by drought or washed away by rainwater, making the lives of the people in the mountainous areas increasingly impoverished. According to recent surveys, in areas such as Laoshan and Yimeng Mountains in Shandong Province, Fuping and Quyang in Hebei Province, and Huizhou Huangshan in southern Anhui Province, the area of cultivated land is generally only 20% to 30% of the area of the mountains, with an average of only about one mu of land per person, and the cultivated land is still decreasing year by year. In the upper reaches of the Yi River, since 1916, 4,500 mu of good farmland have been washed away in seventeen villages alone. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Fuping County had 160,000 mu of land, but now it only has 140,000 mu. The most grain the farmers harvest each year can only sustain them for four or five months, and the rest of the time they have to rely on bran, wild vegetables, and tree leaves to survive. Some families only have one set of ragged cotton clothes, and most families share a single cotton quilt among several people, unable to leave the house in winter, which seriously affects labor production.

　　All these disasters were left over from the historical feudal rule. The reason why the problem is particularly noticed today is that we have defeated the reactionaries, established our own people's government, the semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic structure has been completely disintegrated, the reactionary ruling class that condoned and created disasters has been eradicated from the mainland, and the New Democratic economic plan, unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, is being steadily implemented throughout the country. Thus, it is possible to eliminate disasters and launch a struggle against nature to improve the people's lives.

　　When we revolutionary workers were in a period of hardship, we shared weal and woe with the people in the mountainous areas for a long time and overcame countless difficulties. Finally, we defeated the enemy and achieved the victory of the revolution. Now, generally speaking, the lives of the people in the mountainous areas are still relatively difficult, and we must continue to help them improve their lives.

　　However, how can we improve them?

　　Reclaim more land on the mountains? No, the more land is reclaimed, the more severe the rainwater erosion will be, which will make the lives of the people in the mountainous areas even more painful. For example, in the Yishan mountainous area of Shandong, a village reclaimed 422 mu of land, but 30 mu of good land were washed away by rainwater all at once, resulting in a decrease in grain income. The people already know that this method is not good. The people of Shandong say, "Reclaiming land to the top of the mountain leads to poverty and extinction." This shows that reclaiming land is a dead end and cannot be continued.

　　Since this road is impassable, can we plan to relocate the people in the mountainous areas to the plains? This is also not feasible. Eighty-six percent of China's land is more than 500 meters above sea level. Where are there so many plains to move to?

　　So what should we do? Is there a good way? Yes! Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government are always concerned about the lives and production of the people in the mountainous areas, not only providing relief to the disaster victims in the mountainous areas and providing loans to support the production of the people in the mountainous areas, but also clearly pointing out the production policy for the people in the mountainous areas. The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government specifically stipulated in the 1951 decision on agricultural and forestry production: "In mountainous areas, it is necessary to establish a long-term construction perspective of 'eating from the mountains and nourishing the mountains,' protect and cultivate mountain forests, build mountain gullies, build terraced fields, and develop sideline production, so that the poor mountainous areas gradually become prosperous." Regarding the issue of land reclamation, it also pointed out: "It is absolutely forbidden to reclaim barren mountains and steep slopes; the barren mountains that have been reclaimed must be built into terraced fields."

　　According to the central government's instructions on the production policy for mountainous areas, the Hebei Provincial People's Government has specifically proposed the following main tasks for mountainous area production: (1) Protect and consolidate terraced fields to consolidate existing land. (2) Vigorously close off mountains for afforestation, cultivate fruit trees, and encourage seedling cultivation and afforestation. (3) Develop animal husbandry and promote raising cattle and sheep. (4) Open up markets for mountain goods and native products, and strengthen the transportation and sales of native products. We believe that these measures in Hebei Province are very good. We must start from these aspects to implement the central government's production policy for mountainous areas and truly improve the lives of the people in the mountainous areas. Among them, the focus on vigorously closing off mountains for afforestation is a crucial key to improving the lives of the people in the mountainous areas from a long-term perspective.

　　In 1950, Shandong Province gained good experience in closing off mountains for afforestation. Their method is: first, understand the production and living conditions of the masses, and in light of these specific conditions, publicize to the masses that closing off mountains for afforestation, cultivating fruit trees, and planting trees can improve their lives. Once the masses' thinking is straightened out, they will take active action. They organized mountain closure committees and demarcated grazing areas. In addition, they organized and educated herders, enabling them to graze in designated areas on a planned rotation basis. Then they demarcated closed areas. Within the closed areas, no one was allowed to graze, collect firewood, dig grass, or reclaim land. To take care of the masses' need for firewood, specific times and areas were designated for cutting grass. The masses habitually called this "large-scale mountain opening" and "small-scale mountain opening." The time for "small-scale mountain opening" is around August and September of the lunar calendar, and under the principle of not harming young trees, the masses are organized to go up the mountains to cut grass as feed for cattle in winter. The time for "large-scale mountain opening" is from October of the lunar calendar to January of the following year, which is specifically to take care of the poor, those with less labor, or the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers to go up the mountains to cut grass for fuel.

　　Initially, some of the masses were very dissatisfied with the restrictions on their immediate interests. However, in less than half a year, the grass and saplings in the closed areas grew better and more luxuriantly than in previous years. These facts educated the masses, and the masses naturally had no objections. As a result of this closure, the Laoshan Forest Farm conserved more than 10 million red pine and locust saplings, the Yashan Forest Farm conserved more than 2 million wild seedlings, and the harvest of mountain grass also greatly increased, even on slopes where there was originally no grass to cut. In the Yishan Forest Farm, a small village of dozens of households, the nearby barren slopes had no grass to cut before the closure; but after the closure, they harvested 3,000 catties of grass in half a year. The Taishan Forest Farm cut twice as much grass as in previous years. All other mountain closure areas generally increased their harvests. The masses said, "Closing off mountains for afforestation is really good, cattle and sheep have something to eat, and people have firewood to burn!" They also said, "The Kuomintang destroyed the mountains, only the Communist Party nourishes the mountains. We never dreamed of such a good thing in our lives."

　　The people in the mountainous areas of Shandong Province calculated carefully and were full of infinite confidence and hope in closing off mountains for afforestation, and they couldn't help but shout the slogan "Close off mountains for afforestation, and turn over in ten years!" And they encouraged each other, saying, "People leave descendants and grass leaves roots. Even if we don't plan for ourselves, we must work hard for the future of our descendants!"

　　Once the power of the masses is mobilized and organized, the content of the work is also constantly supplemented and improved. Some people in the mountainous areas of Shandong Province not only carried out mountain closure for afforestation and cultivation of fruit trees, but also did a lot of work in soil and water conservation. They built terraced fields, built mountain gullies, built small reservoirs, stored water and mud, and moved the silted soil to the fields as fertilizer, which not only conserved soil and water, but also reduced soil erosion. In a place near Yishan Yugou, whenever it rained, the mud and sand from the mountain, originating from the Taipo Peak in the headwaters of the Shu River, flowed straight down to Yazhuang with the rainwater, silting up the riverbed for about twenty li. Since the mountain closure and gully consolidation, the situation has greatly improved. The silted riverbed has been deepened by seven or eight inches, and soil and water loss is gradually decreasing.

　　In addition, some forestry agencies in Shandong Province also actively helped the people in the mountainous areas to organize sideline production, such as collecting medicinal materials in the mountains, cultivating sand ginseng on the beaches, or organizing farmers to fish and harvest seaweed, and planting reeds, osier, and wax sticks on the river beaches and sand-covered wastelands. With the help of forestry cadres, the masses gained many benefits and felt that they had a way out for their lives. Therefore, they developed a deep affection for the forestry cadres. This sincere and simple friendship also moved the forestry cadres, making them more active and diligent in their work.

　　The above is a brief introduction to the situation and experience of mountain closure for afforestation in Shandong Province. We believe that these experiences are very important. The reason why Shandong Province's experience in closing off mountains for afforestation is important is mainly that it proves that as long as we act in accordance with the central government's production policy for mountainous areas, the lives of the people in the mountainous areas will be improved day by day, the production in the mountainous areas will be developed day by day, especially the damaged mountain forests will be gradually restored, turning barren mountains into green mountains, and gradually reducing natural disasters.

　　In the future, in order to implement the central government's production policy for mountainous areas, to eliminate natural disasters, and to improve the lives of the people in the mountainous areas, we must strive to do a good job in forestry work in the mountainous areas.

　　封山育林与山区群众生产
    中央人民政府林垦部副部长　李范五
    我国四十多亿亩的荒山，是各种天然灾害的主要来源。这些灾害年年在不同的地区和不同的程度上，严重地威胁着农业生产，使千百万农民辛勤培植的庄稼，往往被漫天的风沙，突发的山洪，骤然的冰雹，损害到无可挽救的境地。
    这些所谓“天然灾害”，倒不一定完全是出自“天然”，主要的还是由于人为——在旧中国的反动政权统治下，对森林只有破坏没有建设，使森林遭受了大规模的摧残。同时，人民处在残酷的封建剥削下，走头无路，不断地逃往山沟，借砍树开荒维持生活，于是又加重了森林的破坏，加重了天然的灾难。
    树砍光了，只有割草；草割光了，就挖草根；以致山上肥沃的泥土逐渐失去遮盖，听凭雨水冲刷。这样，泥土流失了不算，连裸露的岩石也日益风化，变成飞砂，损害了良田。也正由于山上没有草木不能涵养水源，山里存不住雨水，所有泉涧溪沟，便不能细水长流，因而易成干旱；如果下一场大雨，雨水夹着泥砂，在山谷间毫无阻拦地尽情向下冲刷，顿使河床垫高，江河淤积，以至泛滥决堤，成为洪水。山上裸露的砂石，到了夏天，被火一般的太阳晒得焦辣滚烫，当云层突然接触到高热，立刻急剧上升，进入冷空，水珠就马上结成冰块，降落下来，成为雹灾。
    这就是说“荒山是天然灾害的主要来源”的道理。
    我们知道：过去中国的天然灾难，是非常严重的。两三千万亩的田地，遭受水旱之灾；两三千万的农民，遭受饥饿，流离失所，这已经是司空见惯的事。在最近三十年内，平均每三年，就有两次歉收。这就是说，有半数以上的农业收成完全被天灾所吞没。
    “山地开荒，平原遭殃！”这一句由来已久的古话，其中正包含了不知多少惨痛的教训和血泪的史实！实际上，山地开荒的结果，不仅挽救不了山区群众的生活，更使平原的农田增加灾害。
    我们知道：山区本来田地就少；当森林被破坏以后，山区的庄稼，不被干旱枯死，就被雨水冲走，使山区群众的生活愈过愈穷。据新近的调查：以山东省的崂山和沂蒙山区，河北省的阜平和曲阳，以及皖南的徽州黄山等区的情况看，大体是耕地面积只有山地面积的二成到三成，平均每人只能分到土地一亩左右，而耕地仍在逐年减少。沂河上游自一九一六年起，单在十七个村中，就冲去良田四千五百亩。阜平县在抗日战争以前土地有十六万亩，现在只剩下十四万亩；农民们每年收下来的粮食，最多的也只能维持四、五个月的生活，其余便只有依靠糠皮、野菜、树叶度日。个别家庭只有一套破棉衣，多数是一家几口共合一条棉被，到了冬天，连门都出不来。严重地影响到劳动生产。
    所有这些灾难，都是历史上封建统治遗留下来的。而问题在今天之所以特别为人注意，正因为我们打垮了反动派，建立了人民自己的政府，半封建半殖地的经济结构已彻底解体，纵容与制造灾害的反动统治阶级已经从全国大陆连根拔除，为全国人民一致拥护的新民主主义经济计划，正在全国范围内稳步实施；于是这才有可能来消灭灾害，为改善人民生活而展开对自然的斗争。
    当我们革命工作者处在艰难困苦的时期，曾和山区群众长期共过患难，克服过无数的困难；终于打倒了敌人，取得了革命的胜利。现在，一般地说，山区群众生活仍是比较困难的，我们必须继续帮助他们改善生活。
    然而，怎样才能改善呢？
    再向山上开荒增地吗？不行，越开山荒，雨水冲刷越厉害，就会使山区群众的生活更感痛苦。例如，山东沂山山区，有一个村子开山增地四百二十二亩，但一下子就给雨水冲走了好地三十亩，结果粮食收入反而减少了。老百姓已经知道这条办法不好。山东老百姓说：“开山到顶，人穷绝种。”这说明开荒增地是一条绝路，不能继续向前走。
    这条路既然走不通，可否有计划地把山区群众设法往平原迁移呢？这也不行。中国国土有百分之八十六是拔海五百公尺以上，那里有这许多平原可移？
    那么究竟怎样办？有没有好办法？有的！毛主席和中央人民政府时刻在关心着山区群众的生活和生产问题，不仅设法救济山区灾民，贷款扶助山区群众的生产，而且明确地指出了山区群众的生产方针。中央人民政府政务院在一九五一年农林生产决定中具体规定：“在山地要求树立‘吃山养山’长期建设的观点，保护并培育山林，扎山沟，修梯田，开展副业生产，使贫困的山区逐渐走向富裕。”对开荒的问题，也指出：“绝对禁止开山荒和陡坡；已开之山荒，必须修成梯田。”
    根据中央对山区生产方针的指示，河北省人民政府更具体地提出下列几项山区生产的主要任务：（一）保护与整理梯田，巩固现有土地。（二）大力封山育林，培养果树，奖励育苗造林。（三）发展畜牧业，提倡养牛养羊。（四）开辟山货土产市场，加强土产运销工作。我们认为河北省这几条办法很好，必须从这几方面下手，才能贯彻执行中央的山区生产方针，才能真正把山区群众生活搞好。其中尤以大力封山育林一点，从长远的利益设想，更是改善山区群众生活的一个重要关键。
    一九五○年山东省在封山育林方面已得到了很好的经验。他们的办法是：先了解群众的生产和生活情况，针对这些具体情况，向群众宣传封山育林、栽培果树、植树造林可以改善生活。群众的思想打通了，于是积极地行动起来。他们组织了封山委员会，划定放牧区域。此外，还要把牛羊倌组织起来，给以教育；使他们在放牧区内有计划地轮流放牧。然后划定了封禁区域。在禁区以内，不准任何人放牧、打柴、挖草、开荒。为了照顾群众烧柴的需要，规定出割草的一定时间和范围。群众习惯上把这称作“大开山”和“小开山”。“小开山”的时间大约在农历八、九月间，在不许伤害小树的原则下，组织群众上山割草，作为冬天喂牛的食料。“大开山”的时间是从农历十月到第二年的正月，这一时期是专为照顾穷苦的、劳动力少的或者是烈士、革命军人家属上山割草作为燃料。
    最初，部分群众很不满意眼前的利益受到限制。但不到半年，在封禁区内的草和幼树都比往年长得好，长得茂盛。这些事实教育了群众，群众自然就没有意见了。这样封禁的结果，崂山林场保育了赤松和洋槐幼树一千多万株，牙山林场保育了二百多万株的野生苗木，山草的收获量也大大地增加了，甚至连原来无草可割的山坡也有了收成。沂山林场有一个几十户的小村子，附近的荒山坡在封禁以前，原是无草可割的；但在封禁以后，半年收草三千斤。泰山林场割草比往年多两倍。其他所有封山地区都普遍增收。群众说：“封山育林真是好，牛羊有得吃，人也有柴烧！”又说：“国民党破坏山，只有共产党才养山，从老辈子做梦也没想到这样好的事。”
    山东的山区群众算了细账，对封山育林充满了无限的信心和希望，情不自禁地喊出了“封山育林，十年翻身”的口号。并且相互勉励着说：“人留后代草留根，我们就不为自己打算，也要给后代的光景努一把力！”
    群众的力量一经被发动和组织起来，就使工作内容也不断地补充和提高。山东省山区有些群众不仅进行封山育林和栽培果树等工作，而且在水土保持方面也做了不少事情。他们筑梯田，扎山沟，筑小水库，蓄积水和泥，把淤积的泥土移到田里作肥料，既保持了水土，又减少了土壤被冲刷。沂山于沟附近的一个地方，每逢降雨，山上泥沙从沭河发源地的太婆顶随雨水直泻到崖庄，把长约二十里的河床都淤平了。自从封山扎山沟以后，情况大大改善。淤平的河床已被冲深了七八寸，水土的流失也正日益减少着。
    此外，山东省有些林业机关，还积极地帮助山区群众组织副业生产，例如上山采集药材，在海滩上培植沙参或者组织农民打鱼捞海菜，在河滩以及被沙压的废地上栽植芦苇、杞柳、腊条等等。群众在林业干部帮助下，得了很多好处，感到自己生活有了出路。因此，对于林业干部产生了深厚的感情。这种出于至诚和朴素的情谊，也感动了林业干部，使他们对于工作更加积极努力。
    上面是山东省关于封山育林工作的一些简单情况和经验的介绍。我们认为这些经验是很重要的。山东省封山育林经验之所以重要，主要地在于它证实了只要按照中央指出的山区生产方针去办事，山区群众的生活就会日益改善，山区的生产就会日益发展，特别是把已破坏的山林会逐渐地恢复起来，使荒山变为绿山，使天灾可以逐渐减免。
    我们今后为了贯彻中央的山区生产方针，为了消除天灾，为了改善山区群众的生活，必须努力地认真作好山区的林业工作。
