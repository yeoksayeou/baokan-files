　　Spring Sowing in the Suburbs of Beijing Basically Completed

　　The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government convened a joint meeting of district heads from the suburban areas on June 4th. At the meeting, the districts reported on the rush planting situation after the rain. The Suburban Work Committee arranged for the labor model evaluation and election campaign, and the field seed selection work.

　　As of June 4th, with the exception of individual low-lying areas where planting had not yet taken place due to wet ground, the districts had basically completed spring sowing. Crop emergence is generally good, with cotton seedlings emerging at 80-90%. Some farmers in the eleventh district have carried out seedling transplanting work. However, some farmers are afraid that cotton bolls will not form after transplanting and are unwilling to transplant seedlings. Cadres are now actively mobilizing farmers to transplant cotton seedlings. If there are no further unexpected disasters, it is estimated that the yield of wheat per mu on dry land this year will be four to five dou. Fire spiders have greatly decreased after the rain. Individual areas are still plagued by mole crickets, ground silkworms, and cutworms. District and village governments are leading farmers to catch them.

　　In order to exchange agricultural production experience and enable farmers to make further progress in production technology, the Suburban Work Committee instructed all districts to complete the village-level labor model evaluation and election campaign before the wheat harvest. The evaluation criteria are to be based on compliance with the direction of agricultural production development, implementation of patriotic pacts, and driving mass production. (Ding Zi)

　　京郊春耕播种基本完成
    北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会，在六月四日召开了郊区各区区长联席会。会上各区汇报了雨后抢种的情况，郊区工作委员会布置了评比选举劳动模范运动和田间选种工作。
    到六月四日止，除了个别的洼地因为地湿还没有播种以外，各区已经基本上完成了春耕播种。一般作物出苗都很好，棉苗出了有八、九成，十一区有的农民作了移苗工作。但是，有的农民怕移苗后不结棉桃，不肯移苗，现在干部正在积极动员农民移植棉苗。如果再没有意外的灾害，估计今年旱地每亩麦子产量有四斗至五斗。火蜘蛛在雨后大大减少了，个别地区还有蝼蛄、地蚕、串皮虫等为害，各区、村政府正领导农民捕捉。
    郊区工作委员会为了交流农业生产经验，使农民在生产技术上向前推进一步，指示各区，在麦收前完成村的评比选举劳动模范运动。评比的条件是要在符合农业生产发展方向，执行爱国公约及带动群众生产为基础进行。（丁紫）
