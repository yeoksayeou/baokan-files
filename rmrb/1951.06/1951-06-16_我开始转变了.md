　　I Began to Transform
　　Fan Jiacai, Student of Economics Department, Yenching University
　　I grew up in a petty-bourgeois family. In the early days after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was infected with the poison of American imperialist culture. I spent all day watching American movies and American magazines, and the "American way of life" became my ideal in life.
　　In 1948, I entered Shanghai University. The corruption in my life became even worse. I spent all day dancing, smoking, gambling, and skipping classes, indulging in the "American way of life." When the news of the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in the Huaihai Campaign came, I was terrified because of it. I was afraid that the Communist Party was coming, and my ideal of an "American way of life" could not be realized. So I fantasized all day about escaping to the United States to become a White Chinese, and even eagerly hoped that Shanghai could become an "international port city" and be entrusted to the United States. This was only to watch Hollywood movies, read American magazines, listen to jazz music, and dance at all-night parties. I completely betrayed the motherland and the people in my thinking.
　　But after the liberation of Shanghai, I saw the Communist Party's spirit of serving the people and the vigorous vitality of the new China. I gradually became conflicted and pained in my thinking. When the ideological struggle was most intense and could not be resolved, I often considered suicide, but my "courage" was not enough, so I passively escaped and unconsciously went down the road of decadence and demise.
　　Last summer, in order to save myself, I transferred to Yenching University. The great Resist America and Aid Korea Movement rescued me from the abyss of depravity and liberated me from the ideological enslavement of American imperialism.
　　During the propaganda campaign in the countryside, I saw with my own eyes the hard and diligent lives of the peasants, the happiness that the peasants expressed from the bottom of their hearts after the land reform, and their love for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government. All this moved me too much. When I participated in an accusation meeting in an arsenal, I realized the profound disasters that imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries had inflicted on the people. The workers' class hatred, which was deeper than the sea and fiercer than fire, made me look so despicable and shameless. After several days of intense ideological struggle, I began to realize that in this great era, only by contributing everything one has to the cause of the people's liberation can life have true meaning.
　　After initially establishing a revolutionary outlook on life, I excitedly applied to join the Youth League. At the beginning of this semester, a movement to eliminate the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression was launched on campus. I initially examined my own thoughts and found that I couldn't hate American imperialism at all. For example, I still liked to listen to jazz music and insert many unnecessary English words when speaking. These toxins combined to form my backward and erroneous thinking, making it impossible for my emotions to merge with the emotions of the broad masses of the people. I realized that if this kind of thinking was allowed to exist and develop, I would become a sinner of the Chinese people and a traitor to the motherland. I now fully realize that American imperialism's ideological enslavement and persecution of me is more vicious and cruel than anything else!
　　In this Resist America and Aid Korea Movement, I recognized that my previous despicable and filthy thoughts and actions were all "bestowed" upon me by American imperialism. It made me wander painfully at the crossroads of progress and backwardness for so many years!
　　In order to be a great Chinese person, in order to be a member of the Youth League, I must resolutely fight American imperialism to the end!

　　我开始转变了
    燕京大学经济系学生　范家材
    我生长在一个小资产阶级的家庭中。抗战胜利初期，我已感染了美帝国主义文化的毒素。我整天看美国电影、美国杂志，“美国生活方式”竟成为我的人生理想了。
    一九四八年，我进入了沪江大学。生活的腐化更变本加厉起来，整天跳舞、抽烟、赌钱、逃课，沉醉在“美国生活方式”中。当人民解放军淮海战役大胜利的消息传来时，我竟因此恐惧起来，我恐惧共产党来了，我的一套“美国生活方式”的理想不能实现了。于是我整天幻想着自己能逃到美国去做白华，甚至热切地盼望上海能成为“国际港口都市”，请美国来托管。这只是为了要看好莱坞电影，看美国杂志，听爵士音乐，跳通宵舞会。我在思想上完全背叛了祖国，背叛了人民。
    可是上海解放后，我看到了共产党为人民服务的精神，和新中国的蓬勃朝气。我在思想上逐渐矛盾痛苦起来。当思想斗争最剧烈而不能解决的时候，我就常常考虑自杀，然而我的“勇气”不够，于是就消极的逃避，不自觉地走向堕落灭亡的道路。
    去年夏天，为了拯救自己，我转学燕京。伟大的抗美援朝运动把我从堕落的深渊中拯救出来，把我从美帝国主义的思想奴役下解放了出来。
    在下乡宣传中，我亲眼看到农民们艰苦勤劳的生活，看到土地改革后农民，从内心发出的愉快，更看到他们对共产党、对毛主席、对人民政府的热爱。这一切都使我太感动了。参加了一个兵工厂的控诉大会时，我又体会到帝国主义和国民党反动派所给予人民的灾害的深重。工人们那种比海还深、比火还烈的阶级仇恨，更把我显得那样的卑鄙无耻。经过几天剧烈的思想斗争之后，我开始认识在这个伟大的时代中，只有把个人的一切贡献给人民解放事业，人生才具有真实的意义。
    我初步建立起革命的人生观之后，就兴奋地申请入团了。这学期开始时，校内展开了肃清美帝国主义文化侵略影响的运动，我初步检查了一下自己的思想，发觉自己对美帝国主义竟一点也恨不起来。例如，我依然喜听爵士音乐，说话时夹入许多不必要的英语等。这些毒素汇合起来就构成了我的落后、错误思想，使自己的感情不能和广大人民的感情融合起来。我发觉，如果让这种思想存在和发展下去，我将成为中国人民的罪人，祖国的叛徒。我现在充分认识到，美帝国主义在思想上对我的奴役和迫害是比什么都毒辣和凶狠！
    在这次抗美援朝运动中，我认清了我以前那些卑鄙龌龊的思想和行动，都是美帝国主义“恩赐”给我的。它使我在进步和落后的十字路口徘徊痛苦了多少年！
    为了要做一个伟大的中国人民，为了要做一个青年团员，我一定要和美帝国主义坚决斗争到底！
