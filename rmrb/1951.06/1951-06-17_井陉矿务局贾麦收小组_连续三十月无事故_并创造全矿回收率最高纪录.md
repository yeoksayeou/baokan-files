The Jia Maisou Group of Jingxing Mining Bureau
	Consecutive 30 Months Without Accidents
		And Creating the Highest Recovery Rate Record in the Entire Mine
	The Jia Maisou Group of the Jingxing Mining Bureau has not had any deaths or serious injuries in 30 consecutive months and has created the highest recovery rate record in the entire Jingxing mine. From the establishment of the Jia Maisou Group in September 1948 to February of this year, only five of the 148 members of the group have suffered minor injuries, and the mine they are in is a mine with large amounts of water, steep slopes, and bad roofs.
	The main reasons why the group has achieved safe production are as follows:
	First, the group leaders attach great importance to safe production and are good at educating all members, constantly strengthening their concept of safe production. Jia Maisou and the heads of the group's various teams are loyal implementers and promoters of the slogan "Safety First in Coal Mine Production." In on-site operations, the group leaders are constantly preventing things that neglect safety work and violate safety regulations from happening. When such things happen, they immediately conduct criticism and self-criticism in the group meeting to educate the offenders and everyone. Once, the ore car pusher, Yin Gou Xiao, took advantage of the convenience and did not use his hand to push open the air door, but used the ore car to hit the air door, causing the air door to crack and leak air. On the same day, the group meeting conducted a strict criticism of Yin Gou Xiao's behavior of neglecting safety. Yin Gou Xiao also made a self-criticism at the meeting, promising not to violate safety regulations again. The leaders of the Jia Maisou Group also often use the experiences and lessons of other places to educate all workers. For example, in December of last year, the props in a certain coal mining area were not set up firmly, and the workers moved the prop legs while shoveling coal, unfortunately crushing a worker to death. The Jia Maisou Group immediately held a meeting to discuss this, and established the specifications for setting up prop legs and hooking props (nailing wooden boards between the prop legs of the front and rear props) and bracing (nailing wooden boards between the two legs of each prop frame), and made a decision to oppose sloppy work styles and not allow shaking of prop legs and supports when mining coal.
	Second, pay attention to preventing accidents. Jia Maisou and the team leaders of the group firmly advocated "no safety, no coal production, and no exchange of human flesh for coal." Even if the abandoned coal pit (abandoned coal pit refers to the place where coal has been mined. Because of the old method of coal mining, a lot of coal was lost, so people often go to mine it again) where they mine coal is only five meters long, they still have to make two or three entrances and exits, and there must be qualified props at the entrance of the pit. The group often transfers a large number of workers to repair props and maintain roadways. Therefore, even though the roof pressure in the area where they mine coal is the greatest, they can produce safely. They also pay special attention to waterproofing. As soon as the workers see that the coal seam is slightly damp, they immediately report to the group leader and carefully probe the surrounding situation with a drill. Therefore, although the area where they mine coal produces more water than other mines, they have not been harmed.
	Third, strictly implement the special responsibility system, inspection system, handover system, and group meeting system. The Jia Maisou Group believes that strictly abiding by the system is an important key to doing a good job in safety work. They stipulate that the team leaders of each team in the group are the natural responsible persons for the accidents in that team. The district representatives below the team leaders of each team are the natural responsible persons for the accidents in their respective districts. Workers of different types of work also have their own responsibilities. For example, if an accident occurs due to the props set up by the prop worker being unstable, the prop worker must bear the responsibility for the accident. They also strictly implement the handover system. The team leaders of each shift go down the mine half an hour early, and the team leader of the previous shift explains the safety situation. If the team leader of the previous shift does not explain the situation clearly, causing an accident in the next shift, the responsibility for the accident shall still be borne by the team leader of the previous shift.
	In addition, when the group distributes work, they often pay attention to utilizing each person's strengths, and pay close attention to matching young workers with older workers, and matching workers with poor skills with workers with skilled skills, so many accidents have also been avoided.

### 井陉矿务局贾麦收小组  连续三十月无事故  并创造全矿回收率最高纪录

　　井陉矿务局贾麦收小组
　  连续三十月无事故        
    并创造全矿回收率最高纪录
    井陉矿务局贾麦收小组在连续三十个月中没有发生死亡或重伤事故，并且创造了井陉全矿回收率最高的纪录。贾麦收小组从一九四八年九月成立到今年二月，全组一百四十八个人只有五个人受过轻伤，而他们所在的矿是水大、坡陡、顶坏的一个矿。
    该组作到安全生产的主要原因有以下几点：
    第一、小组领导者非常重视安全生产，并善于教育全体组员，经常加强他们安全生产的观念。贾麦收和该组各班组长们，都是“煤矿生产安全第一”口号的忠实执行者和宣传者。在现场作业中，小组领导人员时刻防止忽视保安工作及违反保安制度的事情发生。发生了这种事情，他们立即在小组会上展开批评和自我批评，以教育犯错误者和大家。有一次，推车工殷狗小贪图方便，不用手推开风门，而用煤车撞开风门，致风门震裂漏风。当天，小组会便对殷狗小这种忽视保安的行为进行了严格的批评。殷狗小也在会上作了自我批评，保证不再违反保安制度。贾麦收小组领导人员并经常用别处的经验教训教育全组工人。如去年十二月，某采煤区棚子架得不牢，工人铲煤时又动着了棚腿，不幸砸死了工人。贾麦收小组立即召开会议进行研讨，订立了树立棚腿和勾棚（前棚和后棚的棚腿之间用木板钉起来）、绊帮（每棚架的两个腿之间也用木板钉起来）的规格，并作出决定，反对粗枝大叶作风，采煤时不许动摇棚腿和支柱。
    第二、注意预防事故。贾麦收和该组班组长们都坚决主张“不保安不出煤，不拿人肉换煤块”。他们采煤的落塘（落塘即已采过煤的地方。因老法采煤，丢煤很多，所以往往还要去采）即使只有五米长短，也要做两三个进出口，并且在塘子口一定要有合于规格的棚子。该组常常抽调大批工人去修整棚子，维护巷道。所以，尽管他们采煤的地区顶板压力最大，他们却能安全生产。他们又特别注意防水。工人们只要看到煤层微显潮湿，便立即报告组长，并用钎子慎密地试探周围情况。所以虽然他们采煤的地区出水比其他矿特别多，他们却没有受到损害。
    第三、严格执行专责制、检查制、交接班制和小组会议制度。贾麦收小组认为严格遵守制度是能否搞好保安工作的重要关键。他们规定组内各班的组长是该班事故的当然责任者。各班组长以下的小区代表，为各该小区事故的当然责任者。各种工种不同的工人也有各自的责任。如因支柱工搭的棚子不牢稳而发生事故，支柱工就得担负这个事故的责任。他们执行交接班制度也很严格。各班的组长都提前半小时下井，由上班组长交代保安情况。如果上班组长交代情况不清，致使下班发生事故，其事故责任仍由上班组长担负。
    此外该组在分配工作时，经常注意利用各人的特长，并且很注意使青年工人和老年工人配合，技术差的工人和技术熟练的工人配合，所以也避免了许多事故的发生。（新华社）
