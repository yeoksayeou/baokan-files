　　Yellow River Levee Restoration Project Underway
　　Special Correspondent for this newspaper, Du Wenyuan
　　From Bo'ai County in the western part of Pingyuan Province to Dong'a in the east, along the thousand-li levee lines of the Yellow River and Qin River, 350,000 laborers and cadres are engaged in a patriotic levee repair competition, striving to complete the task of moving over ten million cubic meters of earth before the wheat harvest. After more than ten working days, some counties have already completed their work.
　　The levee repair project involves raising and thickening the Qin River levee in Bo'ai, the Jin levee in Fengqiu and Puyang, and the two lines of defense in Dong'a. The masses along the river have suffered from disasters caused by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the Yellow River in the past. On the basis of widespread Resist America, Aid Korea education, a red flag competition has been launched along the entire line. The laborers put forward the slogan: "Repair the levees well, protect the fields from floods, and also Resist America, Aid Korea." The labor team from Ding Su Cui Village in Shou Zhang County planted the thirteen red flags they had won in previous levee repairs on their own section, striving to win red flags again this time; each of their carts carried more than 400 pounds of soil. In the competition, each labor team brought their own skills into full play, organized labor, improved technology, and improved tools, greatly improving work efficiency. In 1946, the efficiency was about 2 cubic meters per person per day, which increased to 2.7 cubic meters in 1949; this year, laborers in some counties have increased to an average of 6 cubic meters per person per day. In counties with levee repair experience, the method of contracting work was implemented. In counties newly participating in levee repairs, a group of cadres with river management experience were dispatched to provide guidance.
　　Cadres from all departments in the province and the masses along the river have strongly cooperated in this crash task. Before and after the laborers went to the levees, mutual aid production groups were generally established in rural areas, and contracts were signed, with those repairing the levees and those remaining in the village to produce making mutual guarantees. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places supplied a large number of levee repair tools and food, the coal and iron branch companies supplied a large amount of coal, and medical personnel went to the levees to provide medical treatment for the laborers. Along the levee lines, film projection teams and lantern slide shows toured, and local theater troupes, waist drum teams, and folk artists sang everywhere, praising model figures and model deeds in the levee restoration.

　　黄河复堤工程在进行中
    本报特约记者  杜文远
    从平原省西境的博爱县到东境的东阿，在千余里的黄河、沁河堤线上，三十五万民工与干部正开展爱国主义的修堤竞赛，为麦收前完成全线一千余万公方土的任务而奋斗。经过十几个工作日，部分县已完工。
    修堤工程为加高培厚博爱沁河堤至封邱和濮阳金堤及东阿两道堤防。沿河群众过去均遭受过蒋匪与黄水的灾害，在普遍进行了抗美援朝教育的基础上，全线开展了红旗竞赛。民工们提出口号：“把堤修好，保住田地不受水灾，也是抗美援朝。”寿张县丁苏崔庄民工队把历年修堤中得到的十三面红旗都插到自己堤段上，争取这次再夺红旗；他们的每车土都在四百斤以上。在竞赛中，各民工队都发挥了自己的特长，组织劳力，改进技术，改进工具，使工作效率大为提高。在一九四六年的效率为每天每人平均约为二公方，一九四九年提高到二·七公方；今年有些县份的民工提高到每人每天平均六公方。在有修堤经验的县份，贯彻了包工包做的方法。在新参加修堤的县份，则抽调一批治河有经验的干部加以指导。
    全省各部门干部与沿河群众对这一突击任务作了有力的配合。民工上堤前后，农村中普遍建立了生产互助组，订立了合同，修堤者与留村生产者互相提出保证条件。各地供销合作社供应了大批修堤用具与食品，煤铁分公司供应了大批煤炭，医务人员上堤为民工医疗。在堤线上，电影队、幻灯巡回放映，各地剧团、腰鼓队、民间艺人到处演唱，歌颂复堤中模范人物与模范事迹。
