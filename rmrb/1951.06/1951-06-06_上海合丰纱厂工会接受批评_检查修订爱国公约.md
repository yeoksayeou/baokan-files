Shanghai Hefeng Yarn Factory Trade Union Accepts Criticism
    Reviews and Revises Patriotic Pact
    After being criticized in the newspaper for not paying enough attention to the Patriotic Pact, the Shanghai Hefeng Yarn Factory Trade Union is now concentrating its efforts on carrying out a general propaganda and review campaign of the Patriotic Pact in conjunction with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

    After the workers of the factory saw the criticism in the newspaper, they discussed it one after another, complaining that the trade union had abandoned its leadership and demanding that it be corrected quickly. After studying these ideological conditions, the Party branch and the trade union held a meeting of all executive committee members on the same day to start a discussion. Everyone believed that the main reason for these shortcomings was that the work could not grasp the center, doing this and neglecting that, and could not be combined; and that the workers lacked regular ideological education and leadership. All the executive committee members of the trade union made self-criticisms. After the entire executive committee reached a consensus, it convened a general meeting of workshop cadres and group leaders in the factory, and the leading cadres of the trade union made a profound self-examination. The cadres of each workshop reflected various ideological conditions among the masses. After discussion, everyone decided on the methods and steps to carry out the work:

    1. Combine the criticism in the newspaper with the specific situation of each department to deeply and extensively publicize the reasoning behind enacting the Patriotic Pact. 2. Sort out the original Patriotic Pact and have each group review and discuss it: which ones can be done, which ones cannot be done, and why? Analyze it in response to the thinking of the masses. 3. Supplement the handover inspection system and the anti-espionage work of the security team into the Patriotic Pact to enrich the content of the Patriotic Pact, so that the review of the Patriotic Pact is closely integrated with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. 4. Select key workshops or groups, and concentrate efforts by cadres to cultivate typical examples, summarize experiences, and then promote them comprehensively.

    The factory is now vigorously carrying out propaganda work. The night school appropriately rewrote the criticisms in the newspaper and printed them into teaching materials, and the Yue Opera troupe adapted the materials in the newspaper into lyrics for singing and broadcasting. The trade union also repeatedly conducted education using blackboard newspapers, small group talks, etc. Many workers said: "We didn't know the reasoning behind enacting the Patriotic Pact before, and the trade union didn't explain it to us clearly, so we were just careless. We must do it well in the future." Now, the workers are taking the initiative to demand that the original Patriotic Pact be taken out for review. The cadres of the Class A front spinning workshop requested to use one hour of their spare time every day to study the content: "What is a Patriotic Pact? Why enact one?" After studying, they will publicize it to the masses. The maintenance affairs and other departments have also held meetings to discuss how to conduct the inspection work.

### 上海合丰纱厂工会接受批评  检查修订爱国公约

　　上海合丰纱厂工会接受批评
    检查修订爱国公约
    上海合丰纱厂工会不重视爱国公约，受到报纸批评后，现正集中力量，结合镇压反革命工作，进行爱国公约的普遍宣传和检查。
    该厂工友看到了报纸上的批评后，纷纷议论，埋怨工会放弃领导，要求赶快改正。党支部和工会研究了这些思想情况，当天便开了全体执委会议，展开讨论。大家认为产生这些缺点的主要原因是工作抓不住中心，做了这样，放了那样，不会结合进行；对工人则缺少经常的思想教育与领导。工会的执行委员都作了自我批评。全体执行委员取得一致意见后，就召开了全厂车间干部小组长大会，工会领导干部作了深刻的检讨，各车间干部反映了群众中的各种思想情况。大家经过讨论，决定了进行工作的方法和步骤：
    一、把报上的批评和各部门的具体情况结合起来，深入广泛地宣传订立爱国公约的道理。二、把原来所订立的爱国公约整理出来，由各组进行检查和讨论：有那些可以做到，那些做不到，为什么？针对群众的思想进行分析。三、把交班检查制度和保卫小组等防特务工作，补充到爱国公约中去，充实爱国公约的内容，使检查爱国公约与镇压反革命密切结合起来。四、选择重点车间或小组，由干部集中力量培养典型，总结经验，然后全面推广。
    现在全厂正在大力进行宣传工作。夜校把报上的批评加以适当的改写印成教材，越剧组把报上的材料编成唱词，广播教唱。工会并利用黑板报、小组漫谈等反复进行教育。许多工友表示：“老早我们不晓得订立爱国公约的道理，工会也不给我们讲明白，我们也就马马虎虎。以后我们一定要做好。”现在，工友们都主动要求把原来所订的爱国公约拿出来检查。甲班前纺车间干部，要求每天利用工余时间学习一小时，学习内容是“啥叫爱国公约？为啥要订立？”学习后再向群众宣传。保全事务等部门也都已开了会，讨论怎样进行检查工作。
