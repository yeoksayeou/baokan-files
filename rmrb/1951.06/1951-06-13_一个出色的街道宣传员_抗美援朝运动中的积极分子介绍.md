　　An Outstanding Street Propagandist
　　——Introducing an Activist in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
　　Li Yunsheng
　　There isn't a single one of the more than two thousand households in the Chenfang Street area of Taiyuan City who doesn't know Zhao Xiling. Old Zhao is fifty-five years old this year, and supports his family of four by doing petty trade. He hasn't had much schooling, but he studies diligently, is thoughtful, speaks in a flexible and concrete manner that everyone likes to listen to. Since becoming a propagandist, he has been even more energetic than young people and has made great contributions to the patriotic education campaign to Resist America, Aid Korea throughout the street. The citizens praise him as everyone's "key to happiness."

　　Zhao Xiling's propaganda methods have many characteristics. First, he pays attention to understanding the masses' thoughts, and then conducts propaganda based on those thoughts. For example, during the peace signature campaign, one citizen said, "What good is signing a name? It depends on fighting at the front!" Zhao Xiling then used a watch as an analogy, saying, "The screws of a watch are small, but it won't work without them. When 475 million people raise their fists with one heart, we can scare the American imperialists!" Under Old Zhao's powerful persuasion, that citizen not only signed his name, but also mobilized more than a dozen other households in the courtyard to sign. Second, he tailors his message to his audience. If it's a worker, he talks about the worker being the master of the country, and the attitude of being the master, mobilizing him to participate in the patriotic labor emulation campaign; if it's a businessman, he urges them to pay taxes early and participate in patriotic actions, because if the American devils come, business will be impossible. Furthermore, he can carry out propaganda anytime, anywhere. No matter the occasion, he always takes advantage of the opportunity to speak to the masses. Once, Zhao Xiling went to a shop and encountered a group of people chatting idly. One of them said that a dragon had fallen in Huangzhai Village. Old Zhao asked, "Did you see it there, or did you hear it from someone else?" The man replied that he had heard it from someone else. Old Zhao then said, "Yes, how can you believe such a thing if you haven't seen it yourself?" Then he explained the principles of special agents spreading rumors and sabotaging production. Zhao Xiling pays great attention to the effectiveness of propaganda. He said, "Propaganda is not a gust of wind, that's over as soon as it's past." After he conducted propaganda to Chen Airong, a fifty-six-year-old woman in Houyingfang Street, on the day of the "May 1st" parade, he checked whether the old woman participated. When the old woman participated, the next day he went to her home again to see how she understood things, and then carried out more in-depth propaganda.

　　Zhao Xiling is not only active himself, but he also frequently focuses on discovering and cultivating activists. In several months of propaganda work, he has developed seven propagandists and more than one hundred activists to serve as his assistants. When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, he used his own propaganda team as a foundation, absorbing resident representatives, women's representatives, and activists to form a larger propaganda team, formulated a propaganda plan, and divided the work into groups according to each person's familiar area, to carry out individual visits or hold courtyard neighborhood forums in every corner of the entire street, so that the movement could be popularized to every household and every person. Finally, in the mass rally against American armament of Japan and in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty, more than 90 percent of the people on the entire street signed and voted. He can also propose inspiring slogans in a timely manner. When mobilizing the masses to participate in the "May 1st" parade, in order to maintain the order of the ranks, he said, "The parade should be regarded as a battle, and we will not leave the battle line until we defeat the enemy, and we will not go home until the parade is over." The fifteen hundred people from the entire street who participated in the parade and demonstration gathered at eight in the morning and persisted until the end of the parade at eight in the afternoon, and everyone's emotions remained high throughout.

　　After the "May 1st" parade and demonstration, some people felt that they had signed their names and cast their votes, and that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement seemed to be over. Old Zhao seized on this situation and immediately convened a meeting of activists to mobilize them, reminding everyone not to relax. And he planned to use the method of mobilizing the masses to formulate patriotic family pacts on a household-by-household basis, so that the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea could continue regularly and persistently. In addition, he also actively participated in the propagandist teaching sessions convened by the district every half month, and recorded a lot of material as new propaganda capital.

　　一个出色的街道宣传员        
    ——抗美援朝运动中的积极分子介绍
    李芸生
    太原市成坊街一带的二千多户市民们没有一个不知道赵锡岭的。老赵今年五十五岁了，靠做小买卖维持四口人的生活。他念书不多，但学习认真，肯用脑筋，讲起来灵活具体，人人爱听，自担任宣传员以来，比青年人的劲头还高，对全街抗美援朝爱国教育出力很大。市民称赞他是大家的“开心钥匙”。
    赵锡岭的宣传方法有许多特点。首先，他注意了解群众的思想，然后根据群众思想去宣传，例如和平签名运动中，一个市民说：“签个名顶什么事，要靠前方打仗才行哩！”赵锡岭便拿手表来打比，他说：“表的螺丝虽小，没有它可就不行，四亿七千五百万人民齐心地举起拳头来，就能把美帝国主义吓倒！”在老赵的有力说服下，那个市民不但签了名，还动员全院十几家老百姓也都签了名。其次，是看什么对象说什么话。如果是工人，他便从工人当了主人翁，谈到当主人的态度，动员他参加爱国主义劳动竞赛；如是商人，劝他提早纳税，参加爱国行动，美国鬼子要来了，买卖可就做不成。再就是能随时随地宣传，不论在任何场合，他总要利用机会对群众讲。有一次，赵锡岭到一个铺子里去，碰见一群人在闲谈，其中有一个人说黄寨村掉下一条龙，老赵便问：“在那儿见来，还是听人说的？”那人回答是听人说的，老赵便说：“是呀，没亲自看见怎能相信有这种事呢？”接着他便把特务造谣，破坏生产等道理对大家讲明白。赵锡岭非常注意宣传效果。他说：“宣传不是刮一阵风，过去就了事”。他向后营坊街一个五十六岁的老太太陈爱荣宣传后，“五一”游行那天他便检查那老太太是否参加。老太太参加了，他第二天就又去她家看了解得怎样，再深入宣传。
    赵锡岭不光自己积极干，他经常注重发现和培养积极分子，在几个月的宣传运动中，经他发展了七个宣传员，一百多个积极分子，作为自己的助手。当抗美援朝运动开始时，他就以自己的宣传小组为基础，吸收居民代表、妇女代表、积极分子等，组织成一个较大的宣传队伍，制订出了宣传计划，按照各人熟悉的地区，划组分工到全街每个角落，进行个别访问，或召开院邻座谈会，使运动普及到每户每人。最后，在反对美国武装日本和拥护缔结和平公约的群众大会中，全街百分之九十以上的人都签名投了票。他还能适时地提出富于鼓动性的口号。在发动群众参加“五一”游行时，为了保持队伍的整齐，他说：“要把游行看成打仗一样，打不败敌人不下火线，游行不结束不回家”。全街一千五百个参加游行示威的群众，从早上八点集合，坚持到下午八点游行完结，大家情绪始终饱满。
    “五一”游行示威后，有些人认为名也签啦，票也投啦，好像抗美援朝运动已经过去了。老赵抓紧这一情况，五一后立即召开积极分子会议进行动员，提醒大家不要松劲。并计划用发动群众按家订立家庭爱国公约的办法，使抗美援朝工作经常持久下去。此外，他还积极参加区里每半月召集一次的宣传员传授会，记下不少材料，作为新的宣传资本。
