    Cixian Hydropower Plant's Sluice Gate Built Too Weakly

    To the Editor:
    A hydropower plant was built in Nanguan, Cixian County in 1950. The plant's sluice gate has been damaged twice by floods, resulting in a loss of 130,000 catties of millet. If this year's flood is even slightly larger than last year's, the entire power plant will be washed away and submerged, which would cause a great loss to the state. I hope the Cixian County People's Government will pay attention to this as soon as possible. This incident also shows that the cadres of the Cixian County People's Government responsible for the construction work have an insufficiently serious attitude towards construction projects and did not design the sluice gate well. The personnel involved should conduct a self-criticism and learn a lesson from this.

### 磁县水电厂水闸修得太不牢固

    磁县水电厂水闸修得太不牢固编辑同志：
    磁县南关曾在一九五○年修建一个水电厂。该厂水闸曾被水冲坏两次，损失小米十三万斤。如果今年再比去年发的水稍大一些，那座电厂会全部冲坏和淹没，这将会造成国家很大损失，希望磁县人民政府及早注意。这件事也说明磁县人民政府负责修建工作的干部对修建工程的态度不够严肃，没有把水闸设计好。有关人员应进行检讨，引为教训。
