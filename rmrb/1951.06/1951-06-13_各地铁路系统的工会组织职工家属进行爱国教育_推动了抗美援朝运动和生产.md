The trade union organizations in various railway systems actively carry out organizational work and patriotic ideological education among workers' families, further popularizing and deepening the Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. In the Northeast railway system, approximately 200,000 workers' family members have been organized, and 350 literacy classes and 822 literacy groups have been established. In Guannei (Inside the Passes) areas such as Tianjin, Beijing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Changxindian, Fengtai, and Tangshan, family work committees, family literacy classes, and propaganda teams have also been established. After being organized and studying, the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers' families has greatly increased. According to statistics from some areas in the Northeast alone, 170,000 railway workers' family members participated in the signing to support the five major powers concluding a peace pact. In the Fengtai area, more than 200 railway workers' family members organized a Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda team, conducting propaganda in the city and nearby rural areas. Within four days, they collected the signatures of 2,300 women supporting the five major powers concluding a peace pact and votes against the United States arming Japan. The workers' families of the Mudanjiang locomotive section also signed a contract with the trade union, guaranteeing to do a good job in housework, ensuring that workers are not late or leave early, and making more contributions to the patriotic labor emulation campaign. Liang Haiquan, the driver of locomotive No. 755 in this section, was able to concentrate his efforts and repeatedly create new records because his family did a particularly good job with housework.

The family work carried out by railway workers in their spare time mainly takes the following forms: (1) Organizing family literacy classes, allocating a certain amount of time during cultural lessons to discuss current affairs. (2) Holding discussion meetings, recollection meetings, and accusation meetings, where patriotic covenants are established. (3) Organizing propaganda teams to conduct home visits. (4) Using radio and other entertainment activities such as films and dramas with the theme of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, and protecting the homeland to carry out propaganda among workers' families. (5) In areas with concentrated housing, helping families organize mutual aid groups among families to solve difficulties in daily life.

According to the experiences of various places, attention must be paid to discovering and cultivating activists among the family members when conducting family work, and selecting them as cadres and propagandists for family work to expand the propaganda work force. At the same time, attention should be paid to solving the problem of childcare. Many women cannot attend meetings and study because they are burdened by their children, which requires the help of trade union cadres to solve. In response to this problem, the Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau Trade Union specifically opened a children's club in the workers' club, where young children are gathered and cared for by several people in turns during each class and meeting, so that the mothers can study with peace of mind.

　　各地铁路系统的工会
    组织职工家属进行爱国教育        
    推动了抗美援朝运动和生产
    各地铁路系统中的工会组织，积极开展职工家属的组织工作和爱国主义思想教育工作，使抗美援朝运动进一步普及与深入。东北区铁路系统中，已经组织起来的职工家属约有二十万人，已经成立家属识字班三百五十个、识字小组八百二十二个。关内天津、北京、济南、太原、长辛店、丰台、唐山等地也都成立了家属工作委员会和家属识字班、宣传队等。职工家属们组织起来经过学习后，爱国热情大为提高。仅据东北部分地区统计，就有十七万铁路职工的家属参加了拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名。丰台地区有两百多名铁路职工家属组织了抗美援朝宣传队，在市内和附近农村进行宣传，四天之内就征集到二千三百名妇女拥护五大国缔结和平公约的签名和反对美国武装日本的投票。牡丹江机务段的职工家属还和工会签订了合同，保证搞好家务，让职工们不迟到，不早退，在爱国主义劳动竞赛中作出更多的贡献。该段“七五五”号机车司机梁海全，就是因为他的家属把家务搞得特别好，而能集中精力，接连创造了几次新纪录。
    铁路职工们利用业余时间所进行的家属工作，主要采取以下几种方式：（一）组织家属识字班，在文化课中抽出一定时间讲时事。（二）召开座谈会、回忆会、控诉会，在会上订立爱国公约。（三）组织宣传队进行家庭访问。（四）利用广播和其他以抗美援朝保家卫国为主题的电影、戏剧等文娱活动，向职工家属进行宣传。（五）在住宅集中的地方，帮助家属们组织家庭之间的互助组，解决日常生活中的困难。
    根据各地的经验，在进行家属工作时，必须注意发现和培养家属群众中的积极分子，选拔为家属工作的干部和宣传员，以扩大宣传工作队伍。同时要注意解决看孩子问题。许多妇女因为孩子拖累，不能参加开会和学习，需要工会干部帮助解决。牡丹江铁路分区工会针对这个问题，在工人俱乐部内特别开辟了一个儿童俱乐部，每次上课和开会时，把小孩子集中起来由几个人轮流照顾，使得母亲们安心学习。
