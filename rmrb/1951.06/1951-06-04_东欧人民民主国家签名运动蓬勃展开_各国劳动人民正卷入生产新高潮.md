　　Xinhua News Agency, June 2nd: The peace pact declaration signature campaign in the Southeast European people's democratic countries has achieved great victory. Poland adopted the method of "national peace vote" to collect signatures. From May 17th to May 26th, a total of 18,053,315 people voted, accounting for more than three-quarters of the country's total population. The signature campaign in Romania started on April 10th, and by May 28th, 10,052,948 people had signed, exceeding two-thirds of the total population. Bulgaria started signing on April 16th, and recent statistics show that 5,571,000 people have signed, nearly 80 percent of the country's population. The signature campaign in Hungary started on April 8th, and by mid-May, 5.5 million signatures had been collected, nearly 60 percent of the country's population. The Albanian people started signing on April 12th, and by April 21st, 865,885 people had signed, accounting for 73 percent of the country's population. Czechoslovakia is scheduled to hold a national referendum from May 26th to June 16th to support the peace pact and oppose the arming of West Germany. Prior to this, the Czech people held a "Peace Defense Demonstration Month" in April, with more than 3 million people participating in rallies and parades in various cities and villages.

　　The signature campaign has triggered a new production upsurge among the working people of various countries. In Poland's Krakow Province, 270 Stakhanovite "peace work teams" have emerged. Workers in Bulgaria have successively proposed guarantees to complete this year's production plan ahead of schedule. Miners and their families across the country have signed their names. In Lenkov, 1,200 coal miners participated in peace work teams after signing. On the first day of the signature campaign, workers at the Resita Metallurgical Combine in Romania overproduced 2,721 tons of pig iron. Coal miners in Hungary have pledged to produce more coal to strengthen the forces of the peace camp.
