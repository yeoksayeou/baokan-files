The People's Daily published an article on May 30th regarding the theft of grain from our office's dispatched Liulihe team. After several days of investigation, we hereby report the situation as follows:

　　The Liulihe Grain Work Group was dispatched by our office on March 18th of this year. At that time, the group was responsible for both receiving grain from the Northeast and selling it. The work order of the group was very chaotic during the sale of grain, and the grain payment procedures were not clearly divided. At that time, only one weigher was responsible. Whoever bought grain could move it themselves from the stack (sales volume grew from several thousand jin to forty or fifty thousand jin per day), thus creating an opportunity for bad elements to steal grain. Bad elements saw that the grain company had few people and the work was chaotic, so they took the opportunity to steal grain.

　　In late April, Lu Zhenrong, Liu Fengchuan, and Wang Shen, three peddlers from Beilu Village, Third District, Zhuoxian County, stole three bags of grain when they came to our Liulihe Grain Work Group to buy grain. In addition, Zhang Fu from Beiyuanzi Village, Third District, Liangxiang County, and Lu Chengxiang from Beilu Village also stole one bag of grain under the pretext of buying grain.

　　The thieves have now been detained in Liangxiang and Zhuoxian respectively, and the stolen grain has been recovered by the government. The main reason for the incident is that we ourselves have serious bureaucratic work styles. Our work is not thorough, which is reflected in the fact that we failed to check the work of the dispatched grain team in a timely manner, nor did we provide specific assistance. The dispatched staff lacked a sense of responsibility for their work and did not pay enough attention to state property; their thinking was paralyzed. Therefore, we caused unnecessary losses. We believe that the criticisms of Comrades Sun Fulin and Liang Yongxiang are of great help to our work. We hope that everyone will criticize our work more in the future.

### 中国粮食公司通县分公司关于丢失粮食问题的检讨

　　中国粮食公司通县分公司关于丢失粮食问题的检讨
    五月三十日人民日报刊登了关于我处派出的琉璃河小组粮食被盗的事，经我们数日来的调查了解，兹将经过情形报告如下：
    琉璃河粮食工作小组，是今年三月十八日由我处派出的。在当时该组一方面要接收东北的来粮，一方面又要进行出售工作。在出售粮食的时候，该组工作秩序很乱，付粮手续分工不清。当时只是一个看磅员来负责，谁买粮食，谁就可以自己到垛上去搬（售粮情形由一天几千斤发展到四、五万斤），因之给坏分子们就造成了一个愉粮机会。坏分子看到粮食公司人少，工作乱，就趁机偷粮食。
    四月下旬先后有涿县三区北鲁村小贩卢振荣、刘凤川、王深三人，到琉璃河我粮食工作小组买粮食时，偷去粮食三包。另外有良乡三区北元子村张富和北鲁村鲁成湘二人也以买粮为名，偷去粮食一包。
    现在窃犯已分别在良乡和涿县拘押，所偷的粮食已经由政府负责追回。事情发生的原因，主要是我们本身严重的存在着官僚主义作风。我们的工作不深入，这表现在当时对派出的粮食小组的工作未能及时检查，也未能具体予以帮助。所派出的工作人员，对工作缺乏责任心，对国家资财重视不够，思想麻痹。因之，造成了不应有的损失。我们认为孙福林、梁永翔二同志的批评，对我们工作帮助很大。并希今后大家多批评我们的工作。
