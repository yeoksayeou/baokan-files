　　Shulu County's Cotton Selling and Storing Campaign Enters Climax
　　Over 900,000 Jin of Seed Cotton Collected

　　The cotton selling and storing campaign in Shulu County, Hebei Province, has entered its climax. In the first half of June, the county has collected over 900,000 jin of seed cotton.

　　After the State Council issued instructions on selling and storing cotton, the county promptly organized a Patriotic Cotton Collection Committee. It successively convened a representative meeting of propagandists from the entire county and a conference of county and district cadres to uniformly deploy the publicity and mobilization work for selling and storing cotton, as well as specific organizational work. From the 10th to the 17th, all districts and villages universally held publicity weeks. Forty-six reporters and propagandists from county-level organizations went to various villages to hold cotton farmer symposiums. Over ninety county cadres also cooperated with district cadres to go deep into the villages. Over three hundred village-level CCP branches raised the slogan of resolutely completing the task. Over one thousand five hundred rural propagandists and primary school teachers who returned home for the wheat harvest actively cooperated with village Party members and cadres to conduct publicity work in designated areas. In the publicity and mobilization, investigations and research were simultaneously conducted on the amount of cotton stored in each district and village. Based on the investigation results, the county put forward preliminary task requirements to the districts and appropriately allocated cadre strength. The county and districts selected key districts and villages, working and summarizing experiences simultaneously to improve the work. After publicity in the Second Street of Old City in the First District, Party members of the CCP branch took the lead in reporting the amount of cotton they would sell and store. Other cotton farmers felt that the reports of the Party members and cadres were completely truthful, and everyone also actively reported their amounts. By the 14th, all 1,200 jin of seed cotton stored in the entire village had been sold and stored for the state. Dong Xiaoshun, deputy secretary of the street branch, said to cotton farmer Zhang Dexiang when mobilizing him to sell cotton: "The state lent us bean cakes and cotton seeds. Now the state lacks cotton, and factories are about to shut down. What do you say we should do?" Zhang Dexiang understood the state's difficulties and took out all ninety-seven jin of seed cotton, saying: "For the sake of the country, I won't keep even a handful of cotton." There are many such examples in the publicity and mobilization in various villages.

　　In addition to the cotton collection teams set up by the Flower Yarn Cloth Company in five larger market towns such as Xinji, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are responsible for the cotton collection work in general villages. There have also been great improvements in market management. Cadres of the market management committee conduct circular publicity and supervise market activities. Cotton peddlers have been registered and strictly controlled, not allowed to engage in panic buying or speculative buying, avoiding the phenomenon of list prices deviating from market prices, which has increased the amount of cotton entering the market. The amount of cotton in the Weibo Town market on the 9th was 4,000 jin, and on the 14th it reached 14,300 jin. The First and Second Districts also held symposiums for cotton peddlers to conduct patriotic education on selling and storing cotton. The twenty-three cotton peddlers who attended the meeting in the Second District immediately transferred 9,350 jin of seed cotton to the state cotton collection agency. When the First District convened nine cotton peddlers for a meeting, they also reported on the spot 1,000 jin of lint cotton and 3,000 jin of seed cotton. In addition, each market also organized cotton traders to go to the countryside. They are generally familiar with the situation of cotton-storing households and have achieved certain results in helping township cadres mobilize cotton sales.

　　Now the county's cotton selling and storing campaign is continuing to unfold. All villages have universally put forward the slogan "To resist America and aid Korea, to support our worker brothers, and to support the opening of spinning mills, we will not keep a handful of cotton." The Shulu County Committee of the CCP has recently instructed the Party organizations of various districts and villages to further deepen the publicity of patriotism, enlighten cotton farmers to act consciously, and rapidly and thoroughly complete the work of selling and storing cotton.

　　束鹿售棉储棉运动进入高潮
    已收籽棉九十多万斤
    河北束鹿县的售棉储棉运动已进入高潮，六月上半月内，全县已收进籽棉九十多万斤。
    该县在政务院发出售棉储棉指示后，就及时组织了爱国收棉委员会，先后召开了全县宣传员代表会、县区干部大会，统一布置了售棉储棉的宣传动员工作和具体组织工作。十日至十七日，各区村普遍举行宣传周。县机关报告员和宣传员四十六人，分头到各村召开棉农座谈会。九十多个县干部也配合区干部深入各村。三百多个村的中共支部，都提出坚决完成任务的口号。一千五百多农村宣传员和麦假回家的小学教师，有力地配合各村党员、干部分片进行宣传。在宣传动员中，同时进行了各区村存棉量的调查研究。根据调查结果，县对区提出了初步的任务要求，并适当地分配了干部力量。县、区选择了重点区、村，一边作，一边总结经验，改进工作。一区旧城二街经过宣传，中共支部党员首先自报售棉储棉数目。其他棉农群众感到党员干部报的完全真实，大家也都踊跃自报。至十四日，全村所存一千二百斤籽棉已全部售储于国家。该街支部副书记董小顺在动员棉农张德祥售棉时说：“国家贷给咱们豆饼和棉籽，现在国家缺棉花，工厂要停工，你说怎么办？”张德祥明白了国家的困难，就把九十七斤籽棉全部拿了出来，说：“为了国家，我一把棉也不留了。”各村宣传动员中，这种例子很多。
    全县除辛集等五个较大集镇都设有花纱布公司的收棉小组外，基层供销社负责一般村的收棉工作。集市管理上也有很大改进。集市委员会干部转圈子进行宣传，监督市场活动。收棉小贩都进行了登记，受到严格控制，不许进行抢购、套购，避免了牌价与市价脱节的现象。使棉花上市量增大。位伯镇九日集上棉量四千斤，十四日达到一万四千三百斤。一、二区还召开了收棉小贩座谈会，进行了爱国售棉储棉的教育。二区到会的二十三个收棉贩，当场将九千三百五十斤籽棉转售于国家收棉机关。一区召集九名收棉贩开会时，也当场报出皮棉一千斤，籽棉三千斤。此外，各集市还组织了棉花交易员下乡。他们一般熟悉存棉户情况，在帮助集镇干部动员售棉中收到一定成绩。
    现在该县售棉储棉运动正继续开展。各村普遍提出了“为了抗美援朝，为了支持工人兄弟、支持纱厂开工，不留一把棉”的口号。中共束鹿县委近又指示各区村党组织，进一步深入爱国主义的宣传，启发棉农自觉，迅速彻底地完成售棉储棉工作。
