    Protest Against the US Government's Illegal Arrest of Communist Party USA Cadres
    Following the illegal persecution of eleven leaders of the Communist Party USA by the reactionary US government, seventeen more CPUSA cadres were ordered arrested on the 20th of this month, and another four CPUSA cadres are being hunted. This is a further attack by the Truman government on the democratic rights of the American people, with the aim of strengthening fascist rule in the United States to pave the way for a new war.
    The strength of the American people's movement to defend peace and oppose war has frightened the American reactionaries. They vainly attempt to stifle and suppress the American people's anti-war movement with the conspiracy of illegally persecuting the Communist Party USA. But the Communist Party USA and the peace-loving American people will never be intimidated by fascist terror tactics. On the 5th of this month, CPUSA leader Dennis resolutely declared: "No matter what happens, the Communist Party will continue to work to unite the American people against the monopolists and their political agents who are trying to plunge our country into the disaster of a third world war." The reactionary US government's further persecution of the Communist Party USA's atrocities will only arouse greater anger among the broad masses of the American people and peace-loving people around the world.
    The broad masses of the American people have increasingly realized that the reactionary US government's persecution of the Communist Party USA is an infringement on their own democratic rights. Therefore, defending the Communist Party USA has become one of the main tasks of the American people's current struggle.
    The Chinese people resolutely oppose the reactionary US government's persecution of the Communist Party USA, and are determined to strengthen the great struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea to support the heroic struggle of the American people and the Communist Party USA.

　　抗议美国政府非法逮捕美共干部
    美国反动政府在非法迫害美国共产党十一位领袖之后，又于本月二十日下令逮捕了十七名美共干部，并正在搜捕另外四名美共干部。这是杜鲁门政府对美国人民民主权利的进一步的进攻，其目的是要加强美国的法西斯统治，以为新的战争铺平道路。
    美国人民保卫和平、反对战争的运动的力量，已使得美国反动派感到恐慌。他们妄想以非法迫害美国共产党的阴谋，来窒息和镇压美国人民的反战的运动。但是美国共产党和爱好和平的美国人民是绝不会被法西斯恐怖手段所吓倒的，美共领袖但尼斯于本月五日已坚决宣告：“不管发生什么事情，共产党都要继续努力，团结美国人民，反对那些力谋把我们的国家投入第三次世界大战的灾难的垄断资本家和他们的政治代理人。”美国反动政府进一步迫害美共的暴行，只有激起广大的美国人民和世界爱好和平人民的更大愤怒。
    广大的美国人民已日益认清：美国反动政府对美国共产党的迫害，就是对他们自己的民主权利的侵害。因此，保卫美国共产党就成为美国人民当前的主要的斗争任务之一。
    中国人民坚决反对美国反动政府对美国共产党的迫害，并决以加强抗美援朝的伟大斗争，来支援美国人民和美国共产党的英勇斗争。
