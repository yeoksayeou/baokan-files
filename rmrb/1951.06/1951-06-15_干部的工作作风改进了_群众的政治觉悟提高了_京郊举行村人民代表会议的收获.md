　　Cadre Work Style Improved, People's Political Consciousness Raised
    ——Gains from Holding Village People's Representative Meetings in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Shi Wei
    More than half of the administrative villages in the suburbs of Beijing have convened village people's representative meetings or village people's representative congresses. The main content is to discuss and formulate agricultural production increase plans, and in conjunction with this, discuss issues related to carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Among them, 69 villages have democratically re-elected their village governments.
    Generally, the representative meetings in each village have been quite successful, mainly with three gains:
    (1) The representative meeting is very beneficial for educating cadres to improve their work style. The masses in each village raised many criticisms of the cadre's work style at the representative meeting. Generally, the village cadres who were criticized also made serious self-criticisms at the meeting. For example, the village chief of Jiujianfang Village said in his self-criticism: "In the past, I was afraid that others would know when I did something wrong. The more I was afraid of others knowing, the more others would bring it up. I must earnestly correct my mistakes in the future." Village cadre Zhang Fu, who often made mistakes by giving coercive orders, made a self-criticism: "In the past, the puppet Baojia chiefs oppressed the masses; now I also oppress the masses, am I not the same as the puppet Baojia chiefs?" Some cadres with very bad work styles were eliminated during the re-election of the village government.
    (2) It raised the political consciousness and sense of ownership of the masses. Many farmers said after attending the representative meetings: "The people are truly in charge," "In the past, we dared not offer opinions to the village government, but in the future we can offer opinions to our representatives." Because the masses have a preliminary understanding of the representative meetings, when electing representatives, they all elected honest, capable people who can represent the opinions of the masses.
    (3) The production enthusiasm of the masses has been raised, and many villages have formulated production plans. For example, the mutual aid group of Deng Baowen and four other households in Xinfadi Village, District 12, has a total of 51 mu of land and normally harvests 96 shi of grain; the plan for this year is to increase it to 230 shi of grain, raise 6 more pigs (they only raised 3 in the past), and add a donkey.
    In addition, in the process of holding the people's representative meetings, it was also discovered that some cadres and masses have an unclear understanding of the role of the representative meetings. Some cadres believe that if there is leadership, it is not democracy; since democracy is practiced, leadership is not needed. For example, some village cadres said: "With the establishment of the representative meeting, we have less to do; we are only needed for major issues; for minor issues, find the representatives." Wang Rong, the peasant association leader of Beiding Village, District 14, actually believed that the representatives were for collecting public grain. Some people believe that "representatives are for mediating fights and resolving land disputes"; some believe that "representative meetings are meetings of activists"; others believe that representative meetings are only for giving opinions to village cadres. Therefore, to hold representative meetings well, it is necessary to conduct full publicity and deliberation before the meeting to correct this erroneous and one-sided understanding.

　　干部的工作作风改进了   群众的政治觉悟提高了     
    ——京郊举行村人民代表会议的收获
    史威
    北京市郊区已有半数以上行政村召开了村人民代表会议或村人民代表大会，主要内容是讨论和制订农业增产计划，并结合讨论了有关开展抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命的问题。其中有六十九个村已通过民主方式改选了村政府。
    一般村的代表会议都开得相当成功，主要有三个收获：
    （一）代表会对于教育干部使之改进工作作风有很大好处。各村群众在代表会上对干部作风提出了很多批评，一般被批评的村干部也认真地在会上作了检讨。如九间房村村长在检讨时说：“过去我作错了事，就怕别人知道。越怕人知道，别人越给你提出来。我今后必须切实改正错误。”过去常犯强迫命令错误的村干部张福检讨：“过去伪保甲长压迫群众；现在我也压迫群众，不是和伪保甲长一样吗？”一部分作风很坏的干部，在村政府改选时被淘汰了。
    （二）提高了群众的政治觉悟和主人翁感。许多农民在开过代表会议后都说：“真是人民当家了”，“过去不敢向村政府提意见，以后可向咱们代表提意见了”。因为群众对代表会议已有初步认识，在选代表时，都选了老实能干、能代表群众意见的。
    （三）群众的生产积极性提高了，很多村都已订出生产计划。如十二区新发地村邓宝文等四户的互助组，共有五十一亩地，常年打九十六石粮；今年订的计划则要提高到打二百三十石粮，多养六口猪（过去只养三口），增加一头驴。
    此外，在人民代表会议召开的过程中，也发现有些干部和群众对代表会的作用认识不清。有些干部认为，有领导就不算民主；既然实行民主，就不需要领导。如有的村干部说：“成立了代表会，我们的事就少了；大事找我们，小事找代表。”十四区北顶村农会组长王荣，竟认为代表是收公粮的。有些人认为“代表是解劝打架，解决土地纠纷的”；有的认为“代表会议就是积极分子会议”；也有的认为代表会只是给村干部提意见的。因此，要把代表会议开好，必须在会前进行充分的宣传酝酿工作，纠正这种错误的片面的认识。
