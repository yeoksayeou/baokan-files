Chairman Mao Badges on the Korean Front
　　Ha Kuangui, Shanghai Youth Representative, Member of the Third Sub-Group of the Chinese Delegation to Korea

　　This time when we went to the Korean front to express our regards, we brought the love and care of the people of the whole country to the soldiers, and also brought a large number of慰问品 [comfort items/gifts]. Among them, the most popular with the志愿军 [Chinese People's Volunteer Army] soldiers were the Chairman Mao badges. The badge has a red background with a golden, radiant image of Chairman Mao on it, and the words “Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country” below.

　　One day, we stayed in a small village, and the soldiers took care of our lives. They treated us like their own relatives, afraid that we could not endure the hardship, heated the kangs for us, prepared tea, and bought many vegetables and meat from Pyongyang or further places to cook for us. Although everyone understood that this was the soldiers' expression of love for the motherland, they felt very uneasy, because we were the people who came to express regards to the soldiers, but instead became the people being expressed regards to.

　　Comrade Xiao Chen, who took care of us, looked at me every time he came, and sometimes came to see me even when there was nothing to do. Once I grabbed him and asked him with a smile, "What are you looking at?" He refused to say, just smiled, and finally said, "Looking at the badge on your chest." I suddenly understood and quickly took off my beloved Chairman Mao badge and pinned it on him. Comrade Xiao Chen smiled happily. "This is better than anything," he told me, "I noticed it the day you came." Comrade Xiao Chen left, and from his back, I still saw him repeatedly lowering his head to look at the badge.

　　The next day, we held a慰问 [comforting/expressing regards] meeting. Before we even reached the venue, we heard the enthusiastic applause of the soldiers, which was a welcome to the people from the motherland, to everyone who participated in the patriotic labor competition in factories, guaranteed a good harvest this year in the countryside, studied hard in schools for the construction and defense of the motherland, and to everyone who participated in Resist America, Aid Korea. We reported on the thriving construction of the motherland and the widespread and in-depth Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The soldiers listened with incomparable concern and excitement. When we said that domestic youth were enthusiastically participating in military cadre schools, preparing to build a strong national army, navy, and air force, the soldiers applauded warmly and shouted slogans: "We will use victory to answer the people and youth of the motherland!" Finally, we presented badges to the meritorious soldiers. Laughter rang out everywhere, and the meritorious soldiers who received the badges were as happy as children, and the other soldiers also scrambled to watch. We announced a message, "There are ten more badges here, reserved for the meritorious soldiers in the next battle." The soldiers immediately stood up to express their determination: "We must make meritorious service and strive for the badge," one class after another, one platoon after another shouted slogans like a storm, challenging each other. Many letters of determination were submitted, and that kind of revolutionary heroism was truly touching.

　　The next day, we met Comrade Yang, an old meritorious soldier, a model cook, who had ensured that the soldiers could drink water and eat food under any difficult circumstances. Only those of us who have personally experienced the difficulties of the front line can understand his greatness. I saw that he was not wearing the badge he had received last night, and I was a little surprised, so I asked him, "Where is your badge? Where did it go?" He smiled and reached into his arms, took out a small package, and carefully opened it layer by layer. I smiled and asked him, "Why don't you wear it?" He said seriously, "It's not easy for me to participate in Resist America, Aid Korea, this badge was given by the people of the motherland, I will wear it when I return home victoriously, as a souvenir." After Lao Yang finished speaking, he walked back to the kitchen. Looking at his back, I thought to myself: How can we not defeat the enemy with soldiers of such noble quality?

　　毛主席纪念章在朝鲜前线
    中国赴朝慰问团第三分团团员上海青年代表  哈宽贵
    这次我们去朝鲜前线慰问，带去了全国人民对战士们的热爱与关怀，也带去了大批慰问品。其中最受志愿军战士们欢迎的是毛主席纪念章。纪念章是红色的底、上面是金色发光的毛主席像，下面有“抗美援朝、保家卫国”八个字。
    有一天，我们住在一个小村子里，有战士们照顾我们的生活。他们把我们看成比自己的亲人更亲，怕我们吃不惯苦，给我们烧热炕，准备茶水，还从平壤或者更远的地方买来许多菜和肉，做饭给我们吃。大家虽然明白这是战士们热爱祖国的表示，但心里都很不安，因为我们是来慰问战士的人反而成了被慰问的人了。
    照顾我们的小陈同志，每次来都向着我身上打量，有时没事也来看我一眼。有次我就一把将他抓住，笑着问他：“你看什么？”他不肯说，只是笑，最后才说：“看你胸前的那纪念章。”我恍然大悟，连忙把我心爱的毛主席纪念章摘下来，给他扣上。小陈同志快乐地笑了。“这比什么都好，”他告诉我：“你来的那天就瞧着了。”小陈同志走了，从他的背后，我还看到他屡屡低下头去看那纪念章。
    第二天，我们开慰问大会。我们还没有走到会场，就听到战士们热烈的掌声，那是对来自祖国的人们的欢迎，对每一个在工厂参加爱国主义劳动竞赛、在农村保证今年丰收、在学校努力为祖国建设与国防而学习以及一切参加抗美援朝的人们的欢迎。我们报告了关于祖国欣欣向荣的建设事业和普遍深入的抗美援朝运动的情况。战士们以无比关怀与兴奋的心情倾听着。当我们说到国内青年踊跃参加军事干部学校、准备建设强大的祖国陆海空军时，战士们热烈地鼓掌，并高呼口号：“我们要用胜利来回答祖国的人民和青年！”最后我们给功臣们赠送纪念章。到处响起欢笑声，得到纪念章的功臣们乐得像个孩子一般，其他的战士也争着观看。我们宣布了一个消息，“这儿还有十个纪念章，是留给在下一次战役中的功臣们的。”战士们立刻纷纷起来表示决心：“一定要立功争取纪念章”，一个班又一个班，一个排又一个排像暴风雨一样喊口号，彼此挑战。许多决心书递上来，那种革命的英雄主义精神真叫人感动。
    隔天，我们遇到老功臣杨同志，一个模范的炊事员，他曾保证了在任何艰苦的情况下战士们喝得上水，吃得着饭。这在我们亲身体会过前方的困难的人，才知道他的伟大。我看他胸前没有扣上昨晚他得到的纪念章，有点奇怪，就问他：“你的那个纪念章呢？那儿去了？”他一边笑一边伸手往怀里掏，拿出一个小包，小心地一层层打开来。我笑着问他：“你怎么不挂上呀？”他严肃地说：“我能够参加抗美援朝真不容易，这个纪念章是祖国人民送的，等胜利回国时再挂上，留个纪念。”老杨说完就走回厨房去了。我看着他的背影，心里想：我们有这样高贵品质的战士，怎会不把敌人打垮？
