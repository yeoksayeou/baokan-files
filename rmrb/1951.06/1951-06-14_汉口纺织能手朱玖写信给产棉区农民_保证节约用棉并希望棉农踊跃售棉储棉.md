Hankou Textile Expert Zhu Jiu Writes Letter to Cotton-Producing Area Farmers
Guaranteeing Economical Cotton Use and Hoping Cotton Farmers Will Actively Sell and Store Cotton

Zhu Jiu, a female textile expert at the Hankou privately-owned Shenxin Yarn Factory and a special-class labor model in the Central South District, wrote a letter to the farmers in cotton-producing areas on June 8th. The original letter is as follows:

Farmers in cotton-producing areas!

We textile workers have long heard you say, "Love the country and build a home, plant more cotton." We say, "You plant more cotton, we spin more yarn and weave more cloth; we will use such practical actions to build our country."

We textile workers have personally seen that in the past, a large portion of the cotton used for textiles was transported from foreign countries. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, you have been supported in planting more cotton, and last year's cotton harvest was bountiful. However, the cotton produced nationwide last year was still not sufficient to supply all the yarn factories in the country. The American imperialist wolf, seeing that we don't have enough cotton, came to blockade us, preventing us from using the things we produce to exchange for foreign cotton, attempting to increase our difficulties with this despicable and vicious means. However, I believe that the American imperialists' blockade will definitely fail. Cotton farmers across the country have launched a patriotic cotton planting movement; we textile workers have put forward the slogan "Produce one more yarn, kill one more enemy," and are striving to save cotton. When our workers and farmers act together, any difficulty can be overcome.

We textile workers know that the cotton we use in production is obtained through your hard work and cultivation. We must reduce the waste of cotton in production. Our factory has generally established patriotic pledges, and one of the patriotic pledges in the fine yarn workshop where I work is to reduce the waste of raw cotton. In fact, over the past year, the amount of cotton we waste has been greatly reduced.

Recently, we heard reports from the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and some of us were moved to tears. I think: If the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers were not guarding the gate of our motherland, could the workers be able to produce with peace of mind in the factories? Can farmers cultivate well in the fields? We must make the patriotic pledges 100% fulfilled. Now, some of our yarn factories have begun to shut down because they temporarily lack cotton. The State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on purchasing and storing cotton, calling for a patriotic cotton selling and storing movement among cotton farmers. Haven't some of you made patriotic pledges? I hope that you will add selling the cotton you have on hand to the state in your patriotic pledges, which is a patriotic action to support Korea and defend the motherland. If you can sell more cotton, we textile workers guarantee to increase the output of yarn and cloth.

　　汉口纺织能手朱玖写信给产棉区农民        
    保证节约用棉并希望棉农踊跃售棉储棉
    中南区特等劳动模范、汉口私营申新纱厂女纺织能手朱玖，六月八日写了一封信给产棉区的农民们。原信如下：产棉区的农民们！
    我们纺织工人，早就听到你们说：“爱国发家，多种棉花。”我们说：“你们多种棉花，我们多纺纱，多织布；我们就用这样的实际行动，来建设我们的国家。”
    我们纺织工人曾经亲眼看到，过去纺织用的棉花一大部分是从外国运来的。自从中央人民政府成立以后，扶助你们多种棉花，去年的棉花丰收了。但是，去年全国所产的棉花供给全国纱厂还是不十分够用的。美帝国主义这只野心狼，看到我们棉花不够用，就来封锁我们，不让我们用生产出来的东西去交换外国棉花，想用这一卑鄙毒辣的手段来增加我们的困难。但是，我相信：美帝国主义的封锁，一定会失败的。全国的棉农们展开了种爱国棉运动；我们纺织工人提出“多出一根纱，多杀一敌人”的口号，努力设法节约用棉。我们工人和农民共同行动起来，任何困难都是可以克服的。
    我们纺织工人知道：我们生产用的棉花，是你们辛辛苦苦种植收获得来的。我们一定要在生产中，减低棉花的浪费。我厂普遍订了爱国公约，我所在的细纱间的爱国公约，有一条就是减低原棉的浪费。实际上，一年来，我们浪费棉花的数量已经大大减少了。
    最近我们听了中国人民志愿军归国代表们的报告，我们有的感动得掉下泪来了。我想：没有中国人民志愿军的英雄们守住我们祖国的大门，工人们能够在工厂里安心生产吗？农民们能够在地里好好耕种吗？我们一定要使爱国公约百分之百地兑现。现在，我们有的纱厂，因为暂时没有棉花，已经开始停工了。中央人民政府政务院发布了购棉储棉的指示，号召在棉农中展开一个爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。你们有的不是订了爱国公约吗？我希望你们在爱国公约中，添上将手中所存的棉花卖给国家这一项，这就是你们支援朝鲜、保卫祖国的一种爱国行动。你们能够多多卖出棉花，我们纺织工人保证增加纱布的产量。
