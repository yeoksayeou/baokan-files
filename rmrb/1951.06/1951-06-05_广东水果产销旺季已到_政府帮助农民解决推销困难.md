　　Guangdong Fruit Production and Sales Season Arrives
    Government Helps Farmers Solve Sales Difficulties
    The peak season for fruit production and sales in Guangdong has arrived. Lychees, mangoes, green plums, red plums, peaches, etc., are being marketed continuously; bananas, which are produced in all seasons, are already being marketed in large quantities. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government and state-owned trading companies are actively leading private merchants to solve various difficulties and vigorously promote the sales of this year's fruit.
    Before liberation, Guangdong fruits were only sold in various parts of the province (mainly Guangzhou) and Hong Kong, Macau, and Southeast Asia. Only a few large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin were destinations outside the province. Since liberation, the number of Guangdong fruits transported to the north has gradually increased, and sales channels have expanded compared to the past. For example, last year the province transported 100,000 dan of bananas to the north. From January to April this year alone, Guangzhou's fresh fruit shops shipped 180,000 dan. In April, traditionally a slow season, the volume of various fruits transported to the north reached 200,000 dan, with sales reaching as far as Qiqihar, Lanzhou, and Xining. Now that the peak season has arrived, domestic buyers and Guangzhou private merchants transporting fruits to the north are more enthusiastic than last year. According to estimates from Guangzhou commercial circles, the amount of Guangdong fruits sold outside the province this year will double compared to last year.
    Fruit is a famous specialty of Guangdong, with more than 100 varieties. Among them, lychees, bananas, pineapples, etc., are produced in abundance. Chaozhou tangerines, Xinhui sweet oranges, and tropical fruits such as coconuts and jackfruit, special products of Hainan Island, are particularly famous. Income from fruit cultivation is an important source of income for farmers in many areas of Guangdong. For example, in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, more than 400,000 people rely on income from growing tangerines to supplement their livelihoods. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, Guangdong fruit trees suffered severe damage from the Japanese invaders, with 70% of fruit trees such as lychees and olives destroyed. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the heavy exploitation by the Kuomintang bandits and landlords and local bullies, fruit farmers could not make a profit and cut down fruit trees or switched to growing other crops in the orchards, resulting in a significant reduction in fruit production. Since liberation, with the strong support of the People's Government, Guangdong fruit production has gradually recovered, and the lives of fruit farmers have improved accordingly. However, most fruit trees do not bear fruit until three to five years after planting, so the current annual fruit production in Guangdong is only about 30% of what it was before the Anti-Japanese War.

### 广东水果产销旺季已到  政府帮助农民解决推销困难

　　广东水果产销旺季已到
    政府帮助农民解决推销困难
    广东水果的产销旺季已经到来。荔枝、芒果、青李、红梅、桃子等已源源上市；四季盛产的香蕉更已大量上市。广东省人民政府和国营贸易公司正积极领导私商解决各种困难，大量推销今年所产的水果。
    广东水果在解放前只销省内各地（主要是广州）和香港、澳门、南洋，省外只有上海、天津等极少数的几个大城市。解放以来，广东水果北运数量逐渐增多，销路比过去扩大。例如去年全省北运香蕉有十万担，今年一月到四月仅广州一家鲜果行就运出十八万担。历来称为淡季的四月份，各种水果北运量却有二十万担，销地远达齐齐哈尔、兰州、西宁等处。现在旺季来到，国内各地前来采购和广州私商北运水果的，比去年更为踊跃。据广州商业界人士估计，今年广东水果销往省外的数量将比去年增加一倍。
    按水果是广东著名的特产，共有一百多种，其中如荔枝、香蕉、波萝等，产量都很丰富；而潮汕蜜柑、新会甜橙、海南岛特产的椰子、波萝蜜等热带果品，尤为著名。种果收入是广东很多地区农民的一项重要收入。例如，潮州、汕头地区依靠种柑所得补助生活的有四十多万人。但在抗日战争时期，广东果树曾遭日寇惨重破坏，荔枝、橄榄等果树被毁十分之七。抗日战争结束后，又由于国民党匪帮及地主、恶霸的深重剥削，果农无利可图，纷纷砍倒果树，或在果园内改种其他作物，水果因此减产极多。解放以来，经人民政府大力扶植，广东水果生产逐渐恢复，果农生活因而改善。但是多数果树栽种后须三、五年后才有收获，所以现在广东水果年产量仍只及抗战前的十分之三。
