　　Successful Conclusion of Rent Reduction Trials in Some Rural Areas of Xinjiang Province
    Greatly Increased Production Enthusiasm and Patriotic Enthusiasm of Farmers of All Nationalities
    With the enthusiastic demands of farmers of all nationalities, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government conducted rent reduction trials in some agricultural areas of the province last winter and this spring. In the villages where rent was reduced, the production enthusiasm and patriotic enthusiasm of farmers of all nationalities greatly increased, and they warmly supported the Communist Party and the People's Government. A Uyghur farmer named Ali Ahong from Xihua'er Yuanzi Village, Hami County, burst into song after the rent reduction: "If all the trees in the world, big and small, were used as pens, if all the leaves were used as paper, if the water of the sea and rivers were used as ink, and if everyone in the world became a writer, they still could not write enough about the goodness of Chairman Mao and the People's Government." Now, farmers of all nationalities in Xinjiang are enthusiastically demanding the universal implementation of rent reduction in rural areas throughout the province. The First Xinjiang Provincial People's Representative Conference of All Nationalities has resolved that rent reduction will be universally implemented in rural areas throughout the province after this autumn.
    The areas along the Hami, Dihua, and Yili line and southern Xinjiang in Xinjiang, where water sources are available for irrigation, are mostly agricultural areas with developed agriculture, producing wheat, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, sesame, watermelons, and grapes. The farmers are mainly Uyghur, followed by Hui, Han, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups. Land ownership is highly concentrated, with many landlords in southern Xinjiang owning tens of thousands of mu of land. Most farmers are tenant farmers. Land rent generally accounts for 50 to 80 percent of the land's harvest. Remnants of serfdom are still relatively common in rural areas, and tenant farmers often have to provide landlords with a large amount of unpaid labor. Before liberation, the living conditions of farmers were generally very poor and painful. Since liberation, farmers have gradually organized themselves under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party. Last spring, they reasonably resolved the problem of farmland water use with the help of the People's Government and struggled against a few local bullies who monopolized water sources. Last autumn, they struggled for a reasonable burden of public grain. Through these struggles, their living conditions have been initially improved, their awareness has gradually increased, and they have gradually united under the banner of the Peasants' Association; their calls for rent reduction are growing louder day by day.
    Last winter and this spring, 53 counties in Shache, Aksu, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang, and Dihua, Gande, and Hami in northern Xinjiang, selected typical villages in agricultural areas to conduct rent reduction trials. During the rent reduction, farmers of all nationalities united under the Peasants' Association to struggle against individual local bullies who oppressed farmers and resisted rent reduction, and achieved victory in rent reduction. Tenant farmers recovered an average of more than 100 jin of overpaid rent grain per person from landlords. Now, villages where rent has been reduced have all signed patriotic covenants, and farmers are actively launching patriotic production increase campaigns. After rent reduction in the ninth district of Shufu County, farmers immediately bought 52 heads of draught animals and many farm implements, and voluntarily organized ten mutual aid teams to carry out production.

　　新疆省部分农村试办减租胜利结束
    各族农民生产热情爱国热情大大提高
    在各族农民的热烈要求之下，新疆省人民政府曾于去冬今春，在该省部分农业地区试办减租。减了租的农村，各族农民的生产热情和爱国热情大大地提高，他们热烈拥护共产党和人民政府。哈密县回城西花儿园子村的一个名叫艾力阿洪的维吾尔族农民，减租后热情奔放地唱出了一只歌：“把天下大大小小的树当成笔，把所有的树叶当成纸，把海水河水当成墨水，天下人都成为写匠，也写不完毛主席和人民政府的好处。”现在，全新疆各族农民都热烈要求在全省农村普遍实行减租。新疆省第一届各族各界人民代表会议已决议，全省农村将于今年秋后普遍实行减租。
    新疆哈密、迪化、伊犁一线和南疆，有水源可供灌溉的地区多是农业区，农业很发达，产麦、棉、高粱、大豆、胡麻、西瓜和葡萄等。农民主要是维吾尔族，其次是回、汉、蒙等族。土地占有情况很集中，南疆有很多占地万亩到几万亩的地主。农民大部分是佃农。地租租额一般占土地收获的百分之五十到八十。农村中农奴制残余还较普遍地存在着，佃农往往要给地主出大量的无偿劳动。解放以前，农民的生活状况一般是很贫困、很痛苦的。解放以来，农民在人民政府和共产党的领导下已逐渐组织起来。去年春天，他们在人民政府的帮助下合理地解决了农田用水的问题，斗争了少数霸占水源的恶霸分子。去年秋天，他们又为公粮的合理负担而进行斗争。经过这些斗争，他们的生活状况已有初步改善，觉悟已逐渐提高，并已逐渐团结在农民协会的旗帜下面；他们的要求减租的呼声一天一天地高起来。
    去冬今春，南疆的莎车、阿克苏、和阗，北疆的迪化、干德、哈密等五十三县，都在农业区选择典型乡试办了减租。减租中，各族农民团结在农民协会下斗争了个别压迫农民、抗拒减租的恶霸分子，取得了减租的胜利。佃农从地主手中收回多交的租粮每人平均约一百多斤。现在，减了租的乡村都订了爱国公约，农民正积极开展爱国增产运动，疏附县九乡减租后，农民马上就买了五十二头耕畜和很多农具，自愿地组织了十个互助变工组进行生产。
