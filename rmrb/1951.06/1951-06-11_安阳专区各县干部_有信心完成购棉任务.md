　　Cadres in Various Counties of Anyang Prefecture
　  Confident in Completing Cotton Purchase Task
    Communist Party organizations and government cadres in the cotton-producing Anyang Prefecture, Pingyuan Province, have high confidence in completing the cotton purchase and storage tasks. The CPC Anyang Prefectural Committee is holding a joint county committee meeting to deploy this work. The Prefectural Finance and Economic Committee, the Prefectural Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, banks, and other economic departments are studying and preparing specific methods for cotton purchase and storage. The CPC Anyang County Committee stated at the joint meeting that the county's 1.3 million jin cotton purchase and storage task can not only be completed but also exceeded. In 1949, Anyang Prefecture basically completed land reform. After the great production movement in 1950, cotton harvests were abundant, and the lives of cotton farmers have improved. Since last winter, the prefecture has launched the campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the political awareness of cotton farmers has been further enhanced. In addition, a large number of CPC members, Communist Youth League members, and activists are serving as the backbone force throughout the area, so it is estimated that the cotton sales and storage movement can be launched quickly. Some cotton farmers say: Selling cotton to the country is both patriotic and beneficial to ourselves, so why not do it? After hearing the government's instructions on cotton purchase and storage work, the Party members and village cadres of Matoujian Village in the Ninth District of Anyang County conducted self-criticism, saying: This spring, we mobilized cotton farmers to store cotton for the country, and in a few days, eight cotton farmers stored more than 20,000 jin, but unfortunately, we did not carry it through to the end. This is our responsibility. This time we will definitely guarantee the completion of the task. When the cadres of Gangli Village in the district heard the government's call for cotton farmers to sell and store cotton to the state, they immediately reported their cotton storage figures and expressed their willingness to send the cotton to the Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company first, and the price could be discussed later. This spring, under the leadership of the People's Government, the cotton farmers in this prefecture launched a drought-resistant cotton planting campaign, and later there was a good rain, and now the cotton seedlings are growing vigorously, so the cotton farmers are more willing to sell their stored cotton to the state. Now the economic departments of the prefecture have prepared more than 3 million jin of wheat, 20,000 tons of coal, and 3 million jin of salt to supply the farmers who sell cotton.

### 安阳专区各县干部  有信心完成购棉任务

　　安阳专区各县干部
　  有信心完成购棉任务
    平原省棉产区安阳专区各县共产党组织和人民政府的干部对完成购棉储棉任务都有高度信心。中共安阳地委会正召开县委联席会议布置这一工作。专区财政经济委员会和专区花纱布公司、银行等经济部门正研究和准备购棉储棉的具体办法。中共安阳县委在联席会议上表示安阳县的一百三十万斤购棉储棉任务不仅可以完成，而且可以超过。安阳专区一九四九年基本完成了土地改革，经过一九五零年的大生产运动，棉花丰收，棉农生活已获得改善。从去年冬天以来，该专区又展开了抗美援朝和镇压反革命运动，棉农的政治觉悟已进一步提高，加上全区已有大批中共党员、青年团员积极分子作为骨干，因此估计售棉储棉运动可以很快展开。有些棉农说：把棉花卖给国家，既爱国，对自己又有利，为什么不干？安阳县第九区马头涧村的党员、村干部听到政府发出关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，自己检讨说：今春我们曾发动棉农向国家储棉，几天的时间就有八户棉农储存了两万多斤，可惜没有贯彻到底，这是我们的责任没有尽到。这一次我们一定保证完成任务。该区港里村干部听到政府号召棉农向国家出售和储存棉花时，当场报了自己的储棉数字，并表示愿意先把棉花送到花纱布公司，价格多少以后再说。该专区的棉农今年春天在人民政府的领导下展开了抗旱植棉运动，后来下了透雨，现在棉苗茁壮，因此棉农更愿把存棉售给国家。现在该专区的经济部门已准备好小麦三百余万斤、煤两万吨、盐三百万斤供应出售棉花的农民。
