The Nanhui County Cooperative of Songjiang Special District, Southern Jiangsu

	Pay Attention to Raising the Political Awareness of the Masses When Lending Fertilizer
	Cotton Farmers Enthusiastically Sign Pre-Purchase Contracts with Cooperatives

	Nanhui is one of the cotton-producing counties in the Songjiang Special District of Southern Jiangsu. Except for the Sixth and Lao Gang districts, all the other seven districts in the county currently have grassroots cooperative organizations. In order to cooperate with the agricultural production increase movement, the cooperative is undertaking the arduous task of lending fertilizer, expanding cotton fields, and pre-purchasing cotton.

	Judging from the characteristics of the Nanhui area, completing the above tasks is difficult: there is a lot of rain in this area, and planting cotton is not as certain as planting rice. In addition, it snowed after spring this year. Local sayings go, "More snow after spring means more rain," which further increased the masses' concerns about planting cotton. In terms of fertilization, the peasants were exploited by feudal forces for thousands of years, leading to shrinking production and the habit of cultivating without fertilizer. Regarding cotton, there is also the saying: "A yellow cotton plant is a treasure, a yellow rice plant is grass," believing that there is no need to fertilize it. Before liberation, the peasants, who had suffered cruel exploitation, only planted cotton under the conditions of "few people, thin land, and lack of fertilizer."

	However, the Nanhui County Cooperative had a full understanding of the instructions of the superior cooperative—to pre-purchase cotton through fertilizer lending. It made careful arrangements in seven key townships, organized and mobilized through the cooperative system, and launched this work.

	The Nanhui County Cooperative first used examples to illustrate the benefits of planting cotton to increase the masses' interest in planting cotton and their understanding of increasing production through fertilization. In order to dispel the masses' concerns, in-depth propaganda and education on resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, and "man can conquer nature" were carried out. In addition, accusations and accounting were conducted through meetings. For example, Li Dongsheng of Xinjian Township said: "Before liberation, I planted two and a half mu of land, and most of the grain harvested was handed over as rent. The grain was not enough to eat, so where could I get money to buy bean cake!" Jin Shuntang of Jinjian Township said that his two and a half mu of cotton fields, plus one hundred catties of bean cake, yielded an average of more than thirty catties of seed cotton per mu. Under the soaring patriotic enthusiasm, the masses successively planted "markers" in their cotton fields to express their determination to plant cotton, and wrote on the wooden signs: "Patriotic Cotton," "Resist America Cotton," "Defend the Emancipated Cotton," rapidly expanding the cotton planting area. They also made fertilization plans to ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year.

	Second, mobilize to sign pre-purchase contracts. Initially, some areas, because they simply emphasized the interests of the peasants, the peasants produced a bias of not valuing contracts. They believed: "The cooperative must want cotton, and the price must be high. It's the same whether or not we sign a contract." The county cooperative promptly corrected this bias, explaining that pre-purchasing cotton allows the state to control industrial raw materials, which strengthens the power to resist America and aid Korea; and it can prevent speculators and enable everyone to use cheaper yarn. In this way, combining the interests of the masses with the interests of the state, the masses enthusiastically signed pre-purchase contracts with the cooperative.

	Third, after the fertilizer application and production increase movement, the masses' only concern was "If there is too much cotton, it will be difficult to sell, and the price will be low." The cooperative promptly explained the pre-purchase method and guaranteed to purchase a large quantity at the government-stipulated comparative price. The masses warmly welcomed this. Xu Shaozhou of Xujia Village said: "The Communist Party thinks of everything for us. They distributed land, lent bean cake, and pre-purchase cotton to guarantee that the price of cotton will only rise and not fall. Planting more cotton and signing more contracts is the only way to live up to Chairman Mao!" He originally planned to plant four mu of cotton, but later converted two mu of rice fields to cotton and signed a pre-purchase contract for eight hundred catties of seed cotton.

	At present, the Nanhui County Cooperative's pre-purchase cotton work is being carried out enthusiastically. According to statistics from March 27 to April 8, in just twelve days, a total of 12,993 pieces of bean cake were lent out (averaging about fifty catties per piece), 14,198 dan of seed cotton were pre-purchased, and combined with the business of lending fertilizer and purchasing cotton, 31,738 cooperative members were developed.

	The experience of the Nanhui County Cooperative proves that in-depth propaganda and mobilization, raising the political awareness of the masses, and dispelling their concerns about planting cotton are important methods for launching the pre-purchase contract signing movement.

　　苏南松江专区南汇县合作社
    贷肥时注意提高群众政治觉悟
    棉农踊跃和合作社订预购合同
    南汇是苏南松江专区的产棉县份之一。全县除六灶、老港两区外，其余七个区，目前都有合作社基层组织。为了配合农业增产运动，合作社担负起贷放肥料、扩大棉田和预购棉花的繁重任务。
    从南汇地区的特点看，完成上项任务是有困难的：这个地区雨水多，种棉不如种稻有把握。加以今年春后下了雪，当地俗谚：“春后增雪雨水多”，更增加了群众植棉的顾虑。在施肥方面，农民受几千年封建势力的剥削，生产萎缩，形成不施肥的耕作积习。对于棉花更有所谓：“花黄一棵宝，稻黄一棵草”的传说，认为用不着施肥。解放前，受尽残酷压榨的农民，只有在“人少、地薄、肥料缺”的条件下才种棉花。
    但是，南汇县社对于上级社的指示——通过贷肥工作预购棉花，有了充分的认识。在七个基点乡认真地作了布置，通过合作社系统，组织动员，开展了这个工作。
    南汇县合作社首先用实例说明种棉花的好处，提高群众种棉的兴趣和施肥增产的认识。为了打破群众的顾虑，深入地进行了抗美援朝、土地改革和“人定胜天”的宣传教育。并通过会议，进行控诉和算账。如新建乡李冬生说：“解放前我种二亩五分田，粮食收下来大半交了租子，粮还不够吃，那里有钱买豆饼！”金建乡金顺堂说他二亩五分棉田加一百斤豆饼，每亩平均多收三十多斤籽棉。群众在高涨的爱国热情下，纷纷在自己的棉田里插了“标”表示决心种棉，还在这木牌上写着：“爱国棉”、“抗美棉”、“保卫翻身棉”，迅速扩大了植棉面积。并订下施肥计划，保证今年棉产的丰收。
    第二，发动订立预购合同。最初有些地区因为单纯强调对农民方面的利益，农民产生了不重视合同的偏向。他们认为：“棉花，合作社一定要，价格一定高，订不订合同都一样。”县社及时纠正这偏向，说明预购棉花使国家掌握了工业原料，就是增强了抗美援朝力量；并且可以防止奸商投机，能使大家多用便宜纱布。这样，把群众利益和国家利益相结合，群众便踊跃地和合作社订了预购合同。
    第三，经过施肥增产运动后，群众的唯一顾虑是“棉花多产了不好销，价钱低”。合作社及时解释了预购办法，并保证按政府规定比价大量收购。群众热烈欢迎。徐家村徐绍周说：“共产党样样为我们想到家。分了田，借豆饼，又预购棉花保证棉价只涨不跌。多种花，多订合同，才对得起毛主席呢！”他原来计划种四亩棉，后来把二亩稻田也改种棉花，并订立八百斤籽棉的预购合同。
    目前，南汇县社的预购棉花工作正在热烈开展。据三月二十七日至四月八日仅仅十二天的统计，共贷出豆饼一万二千九百九十三片（平均每片约五十斤），预购籽棉一万四千一百九十八担，并结合贷肥购棉的业务，发展了合作社员三万一千七百三十八人。
    南汇县社的经验证明：深入宣传动员，提高群众的政治觉悟，解除他们对于植棉的顾虑，是开展订立预购合同运动的重要方法。
