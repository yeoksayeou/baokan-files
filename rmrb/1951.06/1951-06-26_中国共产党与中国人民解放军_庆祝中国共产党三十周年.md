The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    — Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party
      Xiao Hua
  (I)
    The great Chinese Communist Party has been in existence for a full thirty years, from its inception to the present. For thirty years, the Party and its brilliant leader Chairman Mao have led the Chinese people in four arduous and heroic revolutionary wars (the First Domestic Revolutionary War from 1925 to 1927, the Second Domestic Revolutionary War from 1927 to 1936, the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War since 1946), created and built a powerful and invincible People's Liberation Army, overthrown the dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, and established the great and glorious New China. The Party's thirty-year history of struggle is mainly a history of leading the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army in revolutionary war.
  (II)
    The Chinese Communist Party's creation and building of the People's Army and its leadership of revolutionary war went through a difficult and tortuous path.
    During the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Party had already begun to pay attention to the importance of armed struggle, actively helping Mr. Sun Yat-sen to establish a revolutionary military academy, leading the work of transforming the Kuomintang army, leading the revolutionary war to unify Guangdong, and the Northern Expedition from 1926 to 1927. The Party also controlled a portion of the army. However, at that time, the Party did not fully understand the extreme importance of armed struggle in the Chinese revolution, and did not seriously prepare for war and organize the army. In particular, in 1927, the right-leaning opportunists in the Party, represented by Chen Duxiu, implemented a capitulationist line, refusing to organize and develop the people's armed forces. Therefore, when the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed the revolution and colluded with imperialism and feudalism to launch a sudden attack on the people, the Party and the people could not organize effective resistance. This painful lesson taught the Party: In semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, the proletariat leading the people of the whole country in revolutionary struggle, the main method of revolution, the main form of revolution, cannot be peaceful; without armed struggle, without the people's army, there is nothing for the people.
    After the failure of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Party was not intimidated or conquered by the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel massacre of "rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go." For the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, regardless of the enemy's oppression, continued to hold high the banner of revolution and continued its heroic struggle. On August 1, 1927, the Party led the "Nanchang Uprising." On August 7, 1927, the Party Central Committee held an emergency meeting, resolutely correcting and ending Chen Duxiu's capitulationism, determining the general policy of land revolution and armed resistance against the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of massacre, and calling on the Party and the masses of the people to continue the revolutionary struggle. The Party subsequently led the Autumn Harvest Uprising in various places, as well as the Guangzhou Uprising and the Xiangnan Uprising. The revolutionary armies, workers' pickets, and peasant self-defense forces in these uprisings, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and other comrades, converged to form the unprecedented, truly people's army in Chinese history—the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
    The Party and Chairman Mao cared for the young Red Army in every possible way, and carried out arduous construction in ideological, political, and organizational terms, correcting the adventurism and blind actionism of a few leaders in the Party in guiding the war, ensuring that the Red Army, under the leadership of the Party, fully relied on the strength of the masses of the people, growing from small to large, from weak to strong. By 1930, the Red Army had grown to 60,000 to 70,000 people, with the Jiangxi base area as the center, and fifteen liberated areas had been established on the borders of Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces.
    As the Red Army grew stronger and stronger, the Kuomintang reactionaries became extremely panicked. In the two years from 1930 to 1932, it mobilized powerful forces and launched four consecutive "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the Red Army. The heroic Red Army, implementing Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical principles, continuously smashed the attacks of the Kuomintang reactionary army, and grew stronger and stronger in battle, developing to 300,000 people. After Chiang Kai-shek's failure, he became even more ferocious and unscrupulous, disregarding the Japanese imperialist aggression against Northeast China, Rehe, and North China, clamoring for the treasonous slogan of "internal pacification before external resistance," and, with the support of imperialism, after a long period of preparation, concentrated more than one million troops and began the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign in October 1933. The enemy's offensive could still be smashed, but due to the serious "left" leaning errors committed by the Party leaders at the time, they denied the conditions of the enemy's strength and our weakness, violated Chairman Mao's military line, replaced the guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare that the Red Army was good at with positional warfare that the Red Army could not handle at the time, and replaced the correct people's war with so-called "regular" warfare, so they could not win in the war. In order to break through Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and suppression," the Red Army began the world-shaking 25,000-li Long March in October 1934.
    In January 1935, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee convened the "Zunyi Conference," correcting and ending the "left" leaning opportunist line and beginning a new leadership of the Central Committee with Chairman Mao at its head. This was the most historically significant turning point in the Party. This turning point saved the Party at the most critical moment, ensured that the Red Army successfully carried out the Long March under extremely difficult conditions, and overcame Zhang Guotao's retreat and escape line, preserving the backbone of the Chinese revolution. From this time on, the Party, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, not only developed a strong Marxist-Leninist political line, but also developed a strong Marxist-Leninist military line. The Party would not only use Marxism-Leninism to solve political problems, but also use Marxism-Leninism to solve military problems.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, they applied the experience of armed struggle in the domestic revolutionary war, resolutely implemented the strategic and tactical policies prescribed by Chairman Mao, went deep behind enemy lines, organized the people, armed the people, established political power, and launched a great people's war. In eight years, they resisted 64% of the invading Japanese army and 95% of the puppet troops, shattered countless cruel and vicious "mopping-up operations" and "strengthening of public security movements" by the Japanese invaders, and waged a victorious struggle against the Japanese invaders' extremely barbaric "three alls policy," "cage policy," "blockade policy," and "nibbling policy." They repelled the three anti-communist upsurges of the Kuomintang and all the attacks on the liberated areas in coordination with the Japanese invaders, liberated 100 million people in the enemy-occupied areas, established 19 liberated areas, and developed more than 2.2 million militiamen. In the crucible of war, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army grew to more than one million, trained to become an iron army that could not be dragged down, could not be defeated, and was invincible, and finally, in cooperation with the Soviet Red Army, defeated Japanese imperialism and won the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War since 1946, the People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented the political and military lines of the Party and Chairman Mao, united the people, relied on the people, and, on the basis of rich war experience, annihilated more than 8 million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops supported by U.S. imperialism in less than four years, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, and guaranteed the realization of the People's Republic of China. The People's Liberation Army has also developed into an invincible army of more than 5 million, and on the basis of a strong army, has established a strong People's Air Force and a People's Navy, making New China a military power in the world and a pillar for safeguarding peace in the East and the world.
    History proves that without the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no People's Liberation Army, no victory in the Chinese revolutionary war, and no freedom and liberation for the Chinese people.
  (III)
    The most important reason why the Chinese Communist Party was able to create and build the People's Liberation Army under extremely difficult conditions and successfully lead the Chinese revolutionary war was because it had the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao, with the guiding principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, brilliantly solved the strategic problems of the Chinese revolutionary war and created a brilliant military doctrine, and the People's Liberation Army was armed with this ideological weapon.
    Chairman Mao taught us that the People's Liberation Army is not and cannot be an army of any other kind. It must be a tool that obeys the ideological leadership of the proletariat and serves the people's struggle and the construction of base areas.
    Due to the characteristics of the Chinese revolution being armed people opposing armed counter-revolution, the Chinese people must establish their own revolutionary army and rely on this revolutionary army to achieve victory if they are to gain freedom and liberation. Therefore, the People's Army, which comes from the people, must serve the people's struggle. Therefore, Chairman Mao stipulated the purpose of building the People's Liberation Army: "All the people who join this army... are combined and fighting for the just people's war, for the interests of the broad masses of the people, and for the interests of the entire nation. Standing closely with the people and serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." (On Coalition Government) Also, since the Chinese revolutionary war must be led by the proletariat and the Communist Party, the revolutionary war will fail if this point is not observed or is violated. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army must also be an armed group under the leadership of the Communist Party that carries out the political tasks of the class. Also, the Chinese people's armed struggle began and developed in the special environment of a semi-colonial country with uneven political and economic development, vast territory and abundant resources, the enemy's strength was strong, the people's army was weak, and combined with the peasants' land revolution struggle. If the People's Army is to successfully develop the revolutionary war, it must rely on the peasants and build an army with the peasants as the main body; in the vast countryside where the peasants are located, it must establish revolutionary base areas as strategic bases for preserving and developing itself and expelling and eliminating the enemy; it must carry out extensive mass guerrilla warfare to accumulate strength and gradually develop towards mobile warfare and regular warfare; it must directly or indirectly coordinate armed struggle with other struggles, all for the front line, and implement the general policy of people's war. Revolutionary war is inconceivable without the peasants and the land revolution, without guerrilla warfare, and without revolutionary base areas. Therefore, Chairman Mao stipulated the task of the People's Liberation Army: "It is not only a purely fighting force, but in addition to the one task of fighting, it must also bear the important tasks of publicizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses, and building political power." (Resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Party Red Army) It is necessary to resolutely oppose the purely military viewpoint of the army not doing mass work, the warlordism reflecting the mercenary army, and the banditry thinking reflecting the old-style peasant war.
    Therefore, the People's Liberation Army must wholeheartedly strive for the Party's line, program, and policies, that is, for the interests of the people of the whole country in all aspects. The People's Liberation Army is not only a combat team, it must be good at eliminating the enemy on the battlefield and have the ability to annihilate the enemy; but it is also a work team, it must be good at becoming a propagandist and organizer for the Party and the people's regime, and have the ability to "govern the country and pacify the people."
    History has proven that Chairman Mao's principle of building the army is completely correct. The People's Liberation Army implemented this instruction, bravely fighting in various revolutionary wars, doing mass work, establishing political power, helping local areas establish the Party, and consolidating and expanding the base areas. Therefore, the army had the assistance of the masses, the support of the regime, and the support of the base areas, creating conditions to compensate for defects in weapons and other aspects, creating the premise for overcoming all difficulties in the war, and thus being able to resist the attacks of ten or even dozens of times the enemy, persevere in the war, develop itself, change the situation of the enemy's strength and our weakness, and finally win the victory of the war.
    Chairman Mao taught us that the People's Liberation Army must not only dare to fight and have the courage to overwhelm all enemies, but also be good at fighting and have the ability to control the changes and development of the entire war.
    Chairman Mao said: "The victory or defeat of a war is mainly determined by the military, political, economic, and natural conditions of both sides, which is not a problem. However, it is not only that, but also determined by the ability of subjective guidance." (The Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War) This "ability of subjective guidance" is strategy and tactics.
    In various revolutionary war periods, Chairman Mao, according to the comparison of enemy and our forces, political, economic, natural and other conditions, ingeniously formulated scientific strategies and tactics, arming the People's Liberation Army. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Chairman Mao correctly stipulated the strategic protracted war and the tactical quick-decision war; the strategic victory of more with less and the tactical victory of more with less; "dispersing troops to mobilize the masses and concentrating troops to deal with the enemy"; "the enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we strike; the enemy retreats, we pursue"; "concentrating superior forces, choosing the enemy's weaknesses, and annihilating a part or most of the enemy in mobile warfare with certainty, so as to defeat the enemy one by one," and other strategic and tactical principles. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the two historical documents "On Protracted War" and "Strategic Problems of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War," Chairman Mao correctly stipulated that the War of Resistance Against Japan was protracted and must go through three stages of defense, stalemate, and counter-offensive; universally launching guerrilla warfare in enemy-occupied areas, not abandoning mobile warfare under favorable conditions; establishing guerrilla base areas everywhere, relying on the vast people behind enemy lines, consolidating and developing these base areas, attacking the enemy, and strengthening ourselves, and other strategic and tactical policies. During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Chairman Mao summarized the rich war experience, and in the report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" in December 1947, stipulated the famous ten military principles. The People's Liberation Army resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics, and in various revolutionary war periods, achieved the goal of "preserving ourselves and annihilating the enemy," defeating the powerful domestic and foreign enemies.
    The reason why Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics have become the factor for the People's Liberation Army's victories in all battles is because they are the war art of combining Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and are the scientific summary of the rich experience of the People's Liberation Army in long-term battles with domestic and foreign enemies. This kind of strategy and tactics truly reflects the laws of the overall situation in various revolutionary war periods. Therefore, only by grasping this law can we guide the people's war, annihilate the enemy, and promote the war towards victory. Chairman Mao often advocated "fighting any battle with whatever weapons we have, fighting any enemy with whatever kind of enemy we have, fighting any battle at any time, and fighting any battle in any place," and resolutely opposed empiricism and conservatism that did not look at the location, time, and conditions and mechanically guided the war with partial and narrow experience; and also opposed dogmatism and adventurism that rigidly guided the war with book knowledge. Therefore, proceeding from reality, correctly grasping the overall law, and then guiding the war is the basic principle that Chairman Mao strictly requires us to abide by when learning and applying strategies and tactics. Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed us that every commander of the People's Liberation Army must be familiar with the "temperament" of his own troops (commanders, fighters, weapons, supplies, etc., and the whole they constitute), be familiar with the "temperament" of the enemy's troops (the same commanders, fighters, weapons, supplies, etc., and their whole), and be familiar with all other war environments (political, economic, geographical, climate, etc.); we must attach importance to learning war in the practice of war and summarizing practical experience with scientific methods; we must become brave and wise heroes, and not become reckless people who bump around blindly.
    Chairman Mao taught us that the People's Liberation Army must establish strong political work to unite our army, unite friendly armies, unite the people, disintegrate the enemy army, and guarantee the victory of the battle.
    In the early days of building the army, the Party and Chairman Mao established the system of political commissars and the system of political work in the Red Army. In 1929, at the Gutian Conference, Chairman Mao personally drafted the historically significant "Resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Army of the Chinese Communist Party Red Army," which completely stipulated the basic principles of political work in the People's Army. This basic principle is to educate the troops with the Party's program and policies, to educate the troops with the revolutionary spirit, to make the People's Army consistent internally, to make the People's Army consistent with the people and the people's government, to make the army completely obey the leadership of the Party, to improve the combat effectiveness of the army, and to carry out the work of disintegrating the enemy army, so as to achieve the goal of uniting ourselves, defeating the enemy, and striving for the freedom and liberation of the people. Therefore, this kind of revolutionary political work has become the lifeline of the People's Army.
    Starting from this basic principle, the relationship between officers and soldiers in the People's Army must be united and consistent. Superiors must love and educate subordinates, and must not beat, scold, or insult subordinates. Subordinates must strictly obey orders and support superiors, but under certain conditions, they have the right to make suggestions and criticisms to superiors. Officers and soldiers share weal and woe. The relationship between the army and the people must also be united and consistent, strictly abiding by the "Three Main Rules of Discipline" and "Eight Points for Attention," publicizing the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses to stand up politically, economically, and culturally. The relationship between the army and the regime must also be united and consistent. The army has the task of building the regime, but the army must respect and support the government, implement all the decrees of the people's government, and protect the safety of the people's government. The relationship between our army and friendly armies must also be united and consistent, learning from each other with humility, being courteous and modest, not fighting for booty, and actively supporting each other. The policy on winning over enemy officers and soldiers and dealing with prisoners must be correct. All enemy officers and soldiers who surrender, revolt, or are willing to join the fight against the common enemy after laying down their weapons are welcomed and given appropriate education. All prisoners must not be killed, abused, or insulted. The result of combining this kind of revolutionary political work with revolutionary military work and implementing it in the troops is to make the People's Army an army that thoroughly supports the interests of the people and an invincible army.
    Chairman Mao taught us that it is especially important to strengthen the leadership of the Party in the People's Liberation Army, so that the Party becomes the core of all leadership and unity in the troops.
    In the early days of building the army, the Party established Party organizations at all levels in the army, established Party branches in the companies, and established military, political, logistics, and other work systems under the unified leadership of the Party, consolidating the Party's leadership in the troops.
    Chairman Mao often instructed us that we must constantly strengthen the ideological education of Marxism-Leninism and the proletariat in the troops in order to consolidate and improve the Party's leading role as the starting point for all work. Since the foundation of our army is mostly built on peasants and other petty-bourgeois components, they are the main force in the revolutionary war, but since they come from the petty bourgeoisie, they have shortcomings in their thinking when they first join the army, such as narrow-mindedness, conservatism, selfishness, and laxity. If these non-proletarian thoughts are not overcome, they will seriously hinder the implementation of the Party's line and policies. Therefore, as early as the Gutian Conference in 1929, Chairman Mao solemnly opposed the warlordism and various petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies that existed in the Red Army at that time. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, the entire army, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, carried out a great ideological transformation movement—the rectification movement—opposing non-proletarian thoughts such as subjectivism, sectarianism, liberalism, and lack of organization and discipline. This greatly improved the ideological and political level of the troops, unprecedentedly consolidated internal unity, and further strengthened ties with the masses, thereby guaranteeing the completion of the great historical task.
    Therefore, the Party in the army must improve the collective leadership of the Party committees at all levels and give play to the Party's leading and unifying role in the troops. It must constantly attach importance to the ideological construction of the troops, resolutely implement the education of Mao Zedong Thought inside and outside the Party, carry forward the style of combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and self-criticism, and overcome non-proletarian thoughts. Only in this way can we guarantee the improvement of military, political, logistics, and other work, and guarantee the consistency of thought and the unity of action in the troops.
    It is because the People's Liberation Army has the guidance of such Mao Zedong Thought that it can be good at attacking and good at retreating in the face of powerful enemies, seeking development and victory; it can have complete and superior principles of building the army and strategies and tactics, and build itself into an army with lofty ideals, high discipline, and powerful invincibility; it can cultivate a fine fighting style, a glorious tradition of hard struggle, and a unique revolutionary heroic spirit; it can closely rely on the people and become the backbone of the people's war and the force that guarantees the victory of the Chinese revolution.
    The victory of the People's Liberation Army and the victory of the People's Revolutionary War mark the victory of the great Chairman Mao's military doctrine. The brilliant war art of Chairman Mao is a valuable part of the Marxist-Leninist war doctrine. The Chinese people will forever obtain inexhaustible wisdom and strength from the treasure house of Chairman Mao's military doctrine.
  (IV)
    Under the leadership of the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, for twenty-four years, for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, we have stood at the forefront of the battle, fighting heroically and unyieldingly. Many outstanding Communist Party members have shed their last drop of blood for the people. We have finally achieved the victory of the great revolution of the Chinese people and created and built a heroic army loved by all the Chinese people and the people of the world. This is the glory of the Party and Chairman Mao, the glory of the people of China and the world, and the glory of every commander, fighter, and Communist Party member of the People's Liberation Army.
    Today, the Chinese revolution has entered a new historical period. The People's Liberation Army shoulders new and great historical tasks, which are to resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, defend the national defense of the people's motherland, defend peace in the East and the world, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship internally, maintain social order and various constructions, welcome the great construction period of people's democracy, and strive for a bright and splendid socialist future. Under this situation, the construction of the People's Liberation Army has also entered a new historical stage, which is to build itself into a powerful, modern, and regularized national defense force on the existing basis.
    When celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Party, all Party members in the People's Liberation Army must better strengthen the Party's leadership in the army, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's principles of building the army, highly carry forward our army's fine traditions of building the army, and humbly learn from the advanced military science of the Soviet Union. Educate every Party member and soldier to not be arrogant or impetuous, to work hard and move forward, to be a good Party member, and to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the support of the people of the whole country, we will definitely be able to complete the great and new historical tasks.
    Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the great Chairman Mao!

　　中国共产党与中国人民解放军
    ——庆祝中国共产党三十周年
      萧华
  （一）
    伟大的中国共产党从产生到现在，整整三十年了。三十年来，党和天才的领袖毛主席，领导全中国人民，进行了艰苦卓绝的四次革命战争（一九二五年至一九二七年的第一次国内革命战争，一九二七年至一九三六年的第二次国内革命战争，一九三七年至一九四五年的抗日战争，与一九四六年以来的第三次国内革命战争），创造与建设了一支强大无敌的人民解放军，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的黑暗统治，建立了伟大的、光辉的新中国。党三十年来的奋斗史，主要的就是一部领导中国人民和人民解放军进行革命战争的历史。
  （二）
    中国共产党创立与建设人民军队，领导革命战争，是经过了艰难曲折的道路的。
    在第一次国内革命战争时期，党已开始注意到武装斗争的重要，曾积极帮助孙中山先生创办了革命军官学校，领导了改造国民党军队的工作，领导了统一广东的革命战争及一九二六年至一九二七年的北伐战争，党也掌握了一部分军队。但当时党还没有完全懂得武装斗争在中国革命中的极端重要性，没有认真地去准备战争与组织军队。特别是在一九二七年党内以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义者，实行了投降主义的路线，拒绝组织与发展人民的武力，因而，当国民党反动派叛变革命，勾结帝国主义、封建主义向人民突然袭击的时候，党与人民不能组织有效的抵抗。惨痛的教训了党：在半殖民地半封建的中国，无产阶级领导全国人民进行革命斗争，革命的主要方法，革命的主要形式，不能是和平的，离开了武装斗争，没有了人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。
    第一次国内革命战争失败后，党在国民党反动派“宁可枉杀一千，不可走漏一个”的残酷屠杀下，并没有被吓倒，被征服。中国共产党为了中国人民的解放事业，不顾敌人的压迫，继续高举革命的大旗，继续进行英勇的战斗。一九二七年八月一日，党领导了“南昌起义”。一九二七年八月七日，党中央召开了紧急会议，坚决纠正和结束了陈独秀的投降主义，确定了土地革命与武装反抗国民党反动派屠杀政策的总方针，号召党与人民群众继续革命的战斗。党先后又领导了各地的秋收起义以及广州起义和湘南起义。这些起义中的革命军、工人纠察队、和农民自卫队等，在毛主席和其他同志领导下，汇合组成了中国历史上从所未有过的、真正的人民军队——工农红军。
    党和毛主席对年青的红军，爱护备至，在思想上、政治上、组织上进行了艰巨的建设，纠正了党内少数领导者指导战争中的冒险主义与盲动主义，保证了红军在党的领导下，充分依靠人民群众的力量，从小到大，从弱到强。至一九三○年，红军已发展到六、七万人，以江西根据地为中心，在湖北、湖南、广西、安徽、河南、陕西各省边界，建立了十五个解放区。
    当红军日益发展壮大的时候，国民党反动派极度恐慌。在一九三○年至一九三二年的两年中，它调集强大兵力，连续向红军进行了四次“围剿”。英勇的红军，执行了毛主席的战略战术，连续粉碎了国民党反动军队的进攻，并在战斗中生长壮大，发展至三十万人。蒋介石失败后，更加穷凶极恶，不顾日本帝国主义对东北、热河、华北的侵略，叫嚣着“攘外必先安内”的卖国口号，在帝国主义支持下，经长时间的准备，集中了一百余万军队，于一九三三年十月开始了第五次“围剿”。敌人的进攻是依然可以粉碎的，但由于当时党的领导者，犯了严重的“左”倾错误，否认了敌强我弱的条件，违背了毛主席的军事路线，用当时红军所不能胜任的阵地战代替红军所擅长的游击战与运动战，用所谓“正规”战争代替正确的人民战争，因而在战争中不能得到胜利。红军为了冲破蒋介石的“围剿”，于一九三四年十月，开始了震惊世界的二万五千里长征。
    一九三五年一月，在毛主席的领导下，党中央召开了“遵义会议”，纠正与结束了“左”倾机会主义路线，开始了以毛主席为首的中央的新的领导。这是党内最有历史意义的转变。这一转变，在最危急的关头挽救了党，保证了红军在极端艰险的条件下，胜利地实行了长征，并克服了张国焘的退却逃跑路线，保存了中国革命的骨干力量。党也从此时起，在以毛主席为首的正确领导下，不但发展了坚强的马克思列宁主义的政治路线，而且发展了坚强的马克思列宁主义的军事路线。党不但会使用马克思列宁主义去解决政治问题，而且会使用马克思列宁主义去解决军事问题。
    抗日战争中，红军改编为八路军、新四军，在党和毛主席的领导下，运用了国内革命战争中武装斗争的经验，坚决执行了毛主席所规定的战略战术方针，深入敌后，组织人民，武装人民，建立政权，开展了伟大的人民战争。在八年中，抗击了侵华日军的百分之六十四和伪军的百分之九十五，粉碎了日寇无数次残酷毒辣的“扫荡”和“治安强化运动”，与日寇的极端野蛮的“三光政策”“囚笼政策”“封锁政策”“蚕食政策”作了胜利的斗争，打退了国民党的三次反共高潮和历次配合日寇对解放区的进攻，解放了敌占区一万万的人口，建立了十九个解放区，发展了二百二十余万民兵。在千锤百炼中，八路军、新四军发展至一百余万，锻炼成为拖不烂、打不垮、无攻不克、无坚不摧的铁军，最后配合苏联红军，打败了日本帝国主义，取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利。
    在一九四六年以来的第三次国内革命战争中，人民解放军坚决执行了党和毛主席的政治路线和军事路线，团结人民，依靠人民，在丰富的战争经验的基础上，不到四年，歼灭了在美帝国主义支持下的蒋匪军八百余万人，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治，保证了中华人民共和国的实现。而人民解放军亦发展成为五百余万的无敌军队，并在强大的陆军基础上，建立起强大的人民空军和人民海军，使新中国成为在世界上的军事强国，成为保卫东方与世界和平的支柱。
    历史证明，有了共产党和毛主席的英明领导，才有了人民解放军，才有了中国革命战争的胜利，才有了中国人民的自由与解放。
  （三）
    中国共产党所以能在极端困难的条件下，创造和建设了人民解放军，胜利地领导了中国革命战争，最主要的就是由于有了光辉的毛泽东思想的指导。毛主席以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合的指导方针，卓越地解决了中国革命战争的战略问题，创造了辉煌的军事学说，而人民解放军就是为这种思想武器所武装起来的。
    毛主席教导我们，人民解放军不是也不能是其他样式的军队，它必须是服从无产阶级思想领导的，服务于人民斗争和根据地建设的工具。
    由于中国革命的特点是武装的人民反对武装的反革命，中国人民要能得到自由与解放，必须建立自己的革命军队，依靠这个革命军队来取得胜利。因此，来自人民的人民军队必须服务于人民斗争。所以，毛主席规定人民解放军的建军宗旨时说：“参加这个军队的一切人们……是为着正义的人民战争，为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族利益，而结合、而战争的。紧紧地和人民站在一起，全心全意地为人民服务，这就是这个军队的唯一宗旨。”（论联合政府）又由于中国革命战争必须由无产阶级和共产党来领导，如果没有或违背了这点，革命战争就要失败。所以人民解放军又必须是在共产党领导下的执行阶级的政治任务的武装集团。还由于中国人民的武装斗争，是在政治经济发展不平衡的半殖民地的地大物博的国家，敌人力量强大，人民军队弱小，和结合着农民的土地革命斗争的特殊环境中开始发展起来的。人民军队要能胜利地发展革命战争，必须依靠农民，建立以农民为主体的军队；在广大农民所在的乡村中，建立革命根据地，作为保存与发展自己，驱逐与消灭敌人的战略基地；开展广泛的群众性的游击战争，以积蓄力量，并逐渐地向运动战、正规战发展；把武装斗争和其他斗争直接或间接地配合起来，一切为了前线，实行人民战争的总方针。离开了农民和土地革命，离开了游击战争，离开了革命根据地，革命战争是不可能设想的。因此，毛主席规定人民解放军的任务：“它不仅是单纯打仗的，它除了打仗一件工作之外，还要负担宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，帮助群众，建设政权等重大任务。”（中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会决议案）必须坚决反对军队不做群众工作的单纯军事观点、反映雇佣军队的军阀主义和反映旧式农民战争的流寇思想。
    因此，人民解放军必须全心全意地为党的路线、纲领与政策，也就是为着全国人民的各方面的利益而奋斗。人民解放军不仅是个战斗队，要善于在战场上消灭敌人，有歼灭敌人的本领；而且又是个工作队，要善于成为党与人民政权的宣传者和组织者，有“治国安邦”的才能。
    历史证明了，毛主席的这一建军原则，是完全正确的。人民解放军执行了这一指示，在各次革命战争中，英勇作战，做群众工作，建立政权，帮助地方建立党，巩固与扩大根据地。因此，军队就有了群众的援助，有了政权的支持，有了根据地的依托，造成了弥补武器等方面的缺陷的条件，造成了克服战争中的一切困难的前提，因而能够抗击了十倍以至数十倍的敌人的进攻，坚持战争，发展自己，改变了敌强我弱的形势，最后赢得了战争的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们，人民解放军不仅要敢于作战，有压倒一切敌人的勇气，而且要善于作战，有驾驶整个战争变化发展的能力。
    毛主席说过：“战争的胜负，主要的决定于双方军事政治经济自然诸条件，这是没有问题的。然而不仅仅如此，还决定于主观指导的能力。”（中国革命战争的战略问题）这种“主观指导的能力”，就是战略战术。
    在各个革命战争时期，毛主席根据敌我力量的对比，政治、经济、自然等条件，天才地规定了科学的战略战术，武装了人民解放军。第二次国内革命战争时期，毛主席正确地规定了战略的持久战和战役的速决战；战略上的以少胜多和战役战术上的以多胜少；“分兵以发动群众，集中以应付敌人”；“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”；“集中优势兵力，选择敌人的弱点，在运动战中有把握地消灭敌人的一部或大部，以各个击破敌人”等战略战术原则。抗日战争中，毛主席在《论持久战》《抗日游击战争的战略问题》两个历史文献中，又正确地规定了抗日战争是持久的，必须经过防御、相持、反攻三个阶段；普遍地在敌占区发动游击战，不放弃有利条件下的运动战；到处建立游击根据地，依靠广大的敌后人民，巩固并发展这些根据地，打击敌人，壮大自己等战略战术方针。第三次国内革命战争时期，毛主席总结了丰富的战争经验，在一九四七年十二月的《目前形势和我们的任务》报告中规定了著名的十大军事原则。人民解放军坚决执行了毛主席的战略战术，在各个革命战争时期中，达到了“保存自己，消灭敌人”的目的，打败了强大的国内外的敌人。
    毛主席的战略战术，所以成为人民解放军百战百胜的因素，是因为它是马克思列宁主义与中国革命具体实践相结合的战争艺术，是人民解放军和国内外敌人长期作战中丰富经验的科学总结。这种战略战术，真实地反映了各个革命战争时期的全局的规律，因此，只有掌握了这种规律，才能指导人民战争，歼灭敌人，推动战争走向胜利。毛主席经常提倡“有什么武器打什么仗，有什么样的敌人打什么样的仗，在什么时候，打什么仗，在什么地方打什么仗”，坚决反对不看地点、时间与条件，机械地以局部的、狭隘的经验去指导战争的经验主义和保守主义；也反对死板的以书本知识去指导战争的教条主义和冒险主义。所以，从实际出发，正确地掌握全面的规律，再去指导战争，是毛主席严格要求我们学习和运用战略战术时必须遵守的基本原则。毛主席再三指示我们，人民解放军的每一个指挥员，要摸熟自己部队（指挥员、战斗员、武器、给养等等及由他们构成的总体）的“脾气”，摸熟敌人部队（同样指挥员、战斗员、武器、给养等等及其总体）的“脾气”，摸熟一切其他战争环境（政治、经济、地理、气候等）；要重视在战争实践中学习战争，以科学方法总结实践经验；要成为勇敢而明智的英雄，不能成为乱撞乱碰的鲁莽家。
    毛主席教导我们，人民解放军必须建立坚强的政治工作，为团结我军，团结友军，团结人民，瓦解敌军，保证战斗胜利而斗争。
    党和毛主席在建军初期，就在红军中建立起政治委员制度和政治工作制度。一九二九年古田会议中，毛主席亲手起草了有历史意义的《中国共产党红军第四军第九次代表大会决议案》，完整地规定了人民军队中政治工作的基本原则。这个基本原则就是以党的纲领政策教育部队，以革命的精神教育部队，使人民军队内部趋于一致，使人民军队与人民、人民政府趋于一致，使军队完全服从党的领导，提高军队的战斗力，并进行瓦解敌军工作，达到团结自己，战胜敌人，争取人民的自由与解放的目的。因此，这种革命的政治工作就成为了人民军队的生命线。
    从这一基本原则出发，人民军队在官兵关系上必须是团结一致的，上级要爱护和教育下级，不能打骂和侮辱下级，下级要严格服从指挥，拥护上级，但在一定条件下有向上级提出建议和批评的权利，官兵之间，同甘共苦；在军民关系上也必须是团结一致的，严格遵守“三大纪律”“八项注意”；宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，帮助人民群众在政治上、经济上、文化上翻身。在军队与政权的关系上也必须是团结一致的，军队负有建设政权的任务，但军队必须尊重和拥护政府，执行人民政府的一切法令，保护人民政府的安全。在本军与友军的关系上也必须是团结一致的，互相间虚心学习，谦恭礼让，不争缴获，主动支援。在争取敌军官兵与处理俘虏的政策上必须是正确的，凡属投诚的，起义的，或在放下武器后愿意参加反对共同敌人的敌军官兵，一概表示欢迎，并给予适当的教育。一切俘虏，不许杀害、虐待与侮辱。这种革命的政治工作与革命的军事工作结合起来在部队中实行的结果，就使人民军队成为彻底拥护人民利益的军队，成为不可战胜的军队。
    毛主席教导我们，特别重要的，要在人民解放军中，加强党的领导，使党成为部队的一切领导与团结的核心。
    党在建军初期，就在军队中建立各级党的组织，在连队中建立了党的支部，并在党的统一领导下，建立了军事、政治、后勤等工作制度，巩固了党在部队中的领导。
    毛主席经常指示我们，必须在部队中不断加强马克思列宁主义的无产阶级的思想教育，以巩固与提高党的领导作用，作为一切工作的出发点。由于我们军队的基础最大部分是建筑在农民及其他小资产阶级成份之上，他们是革命战争的主力军，但由于他们出身于小资产阶级，在他们初入伍时，思想上存在着狭隘、保守、自私、散漫等缺点，对这些非无产阶级思想，如不予以克服，就会严重地妨碍了对党的路线、政策的执行。因此，毛主席早在一九二九年古田会议中，就严肃地反对了当时红军中存在的军阀主义与各种小资产阶级的思想偏向。在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，全军在党和毛主席的领导下，进行了伟大的改造思想运动——整风运动，反对了主观主义、宗派主义、自由主义、无组织无纪律等非无产阶级思想。这就大大提高了部队的思想水平与政治水平，空前地巩固了内部的团结与统一，更密切了与群众的联系，从而保证了伟大的历史任务的完成。
    所以，军队中的党，必须健全各级党委会的集体领导，发挥党在部队中的领导与团结的核心作用。必须经常地重视部队的思想建设，在党内党外坚决贯彻毛泽东思想的教育，发扬理论与实践一致、密切联系群众和自我批评的作风，克服非无产阶级思想。只有如此，才能保证军事、政治、后勤等各项工作的提高，保证部队思想的一致和行动的统一。
    人民解放军就是由于有这样的毛泽东思想的指导下，所以才能在强大的敌人面前，善于进攻，善于退却，求得发展与胜利；才能有完整的、优越的建军原则和战略战术，建设成为有崇高理想的、有高度纪律性的、强大无敌的军队；才能培植起优良的战斗作风，艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，和特有的革命英雄主义气概，才能紧紧地依靠人民，成为人民战争的中坚和保证中国革命胜利具有决定意义的力量。
    人民解放军的胜利，人民革命战争的胜利，标志了伟大的毛主席的军事学说的胜利。光辉的毛主席的战争艺术，是马克思列宁主义战争学说中的宝贵的一部分，全中国人民从毛主席的军事学说的宝库中，将永远获得取之不尽、用之不竭的智慧与力量。
