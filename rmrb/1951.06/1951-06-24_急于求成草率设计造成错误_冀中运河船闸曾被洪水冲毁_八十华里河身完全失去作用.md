Rushing for Quick Success and Careless Design Caused Errors
    Jizhong Canal Lock Was Once Destroyed by Flood
    Eighty Li of River Body Completely Lost its Function
    The Jizhong Canal construction project, spanning 180 li, suffered serious consequences due to careless and hasty surveying and design. The project was managed by the Jizhong Water Conservancy Bureau. Surveying took place in May and June of 1947, design in July and August, and construction began in September. The total project budget was 8 million jin of rice, indicating a considerably large scale. The canal ran from Xigaotan in Xian County on the Ziya River, through Hejian to Gougezhuang in Renqiu, connecting with the Daqing River. A total of three locks were built on the canal: one in Xigaotan, Xian County, one in Banjiehe, Hejian, and one in Gougezhuang, Renqiu. The locks were the main structures of the canal, built with bricks and dimension stone (stones processed to have flat surfaces), and entirely sealed with clay. Only a small amount of cement was used for pointing. Clay had two main drawbacks: first, it had a large shrinkage and weak binding force, while bricks had high water absorption. When clay slurry was used to fill the seams, the clay had to be very thin. Once the slurry in the brick seams dried, it would shrink, inevitably causing cracks in the brick walls. Second, the compressive strength of clay was lower than that of cement. As a result, after the locks were completed, the clay joints were compressed, and the cement pointing became loose and detached. The structures leaked, the bonding was weak, and bricks in the brick walls could even be pulled out by hand. After the canal was completed in July 1948, a major flood occurred, and the three locks successively experienced problems. The bottoms of all three locks and the walls of the Gougezhuang lock were damaged by the flood. At this point, it was necessary to stop releasing water, revise the plan, and add an additional budget of 2.6 million jin of rice (bringing the total cost to over 10 million jin) to repair the bottoms and walls of the three locks, resulting in a waste of significant labor hours and resources. In addition, the canal passed through the Wuguanding depression south of the Daqing River. This depression was lower than the planned bottom of the canal, requiring the construction of levees about four meters high to ensure the canal's smooth passage. However, the soil in this area was "chicken manure soil," which appeared hard but dissolved when exposed to water, making it highly unsuitable for building levees. The canal drained from west to east and had to pass through Wuguanding. If levees were built along the canal in the Wuguanding section, water could not be drained, so it was decided not to build levees. As a result, the eighty li section of the riverbed in Wuguanding, although excavated, completely lost its function for navigation.

    The fundamental cause of these two serious errors was the eagerness for quick success in leadership thinking and the lack of thoroughness in engineering design. The construction of locks in such a large-scale water conservancy project required them to be very strong and watertight, which necessitated the use of a large amount of cement. At that time, it was difficult to purchase cement due to the enemy's blockades, so the personnel responsible for the engineering design proposed using clay instead of cement. The cadres in charge of the project lacked experience and did not properly consider whether this suggestion was appropriate. They did not anticipate the difficulties that might arise during construction, nor did they report the cement shortage to higher authorities. They only wanted to complete the task quickly, regardless of the consequences, and blindly proceeded with construction. The decision on the canal's route by the competent authorities at the time was also quite hasty. They only conducted one survey and glanced at the route, and then finalized it. When determining the route through the Wuguanding section, local people raised concerns, believing that levees could not be built in that area. However, this correct opinion was not adopted. At that time, the competent authorities of the canal project had already identified some problems but did not continue to study and investigate them, and then rashly made a decision. This was completely wrong, and this serious lesson should be deeply remembered by all localities.

　　急于求成草率设计造成错误
    冀中运河船闸曾被洪水冲毁
    八十华里河身完全失去作用
    全长一百八十华里的冀中运河建筑工程，由于勘察设计的马虎草率，造成严重恶果。该工程由冀中水利局主办，于一九四七年五、六月测量，七、八月设计，九月开工。全部工程预算为八百万斤米，工程规模相当巨大。该河系从子牙河献县西高坦起，经河间至任邱苟各庄与大清河连接。全河共修三个船闸，一在献县西高坦，一在河间半截河，一在任邱苟各庄。船闸是该运河的主要工程，以砖和料石（经过制作有平面的石头）砌成，全部以胶泥灌缝，只使用很少洋灰抅缝。胶泥有两个主要缺点：第一是收缩性大，结合力小。而砖的吸水性很大。利用胶泥浆灌缝时，胶泥必须很稀，砖缝中的泥浆干了，即行收缩，砖墙必然裂缝。第二，胶泥耐压力比洋灰小。结果，船闸修好以后，胶泥接缝被压缩，洋灰抅缝支离脱落。建筑物透水，结合不牢，甚至砖墙上的砖，用手一抽就抽出来了。该运河于一九四八年七月完成后，恰恰发了大水，三个船闸相继发生问题。三个船闸的闸底及苟各庄船闸的闸墙，都被大水冲坏。这时只好停止放水，重新改修计划，追加预算二百六十万斤米（前后共用去一千多万斤米），将三个船闸的闸底与闸墙分别修好，结果浪费了大量的工时与资财。另外，运河在大清河以南通过五官淀洼地，这个洼地比计划中的运河底还要低，必须建筑高达四公尺左右的堤防，才能保证运河顺利通过。但该地土质是鸡粪土，看起来很硬，见水就化了，极不宜于修筑堤防。运河系由西向东排水，必须经过五官淀。如果在五官淀一段筑运河堤，水即无法排泄，只好不筑河堤了。这样五官淀一段八十华里的河身虽已挖好，但是完全失去了通航的作用。
    领导思想上急于求成，工程设计上粗枝大叶，是发生上述两个严重错误的根本原因。这样大规模的水利工程中的船闸建筑，必须十分牢固，不能透水，为此，必须使用大量洋灰。当时在敌人层层封锁，购买洋灰很困难，负责工程设计的人员即提出用胶泥代替洋灰。负责该项工程的干部缺乏经验，既没有很好地考虑这个意见对不对，又没有估计在施工中可能发生的困难，也没有向上级报告洋灰缺乏的情况，只想赶快完成任务，不管造成什么恶果，就盲目施工了。当时主管部门对运河路线的决定，也是相当草率的。只做了一次测量，沿途看了一下，就把路线确定了。确定五官淀一段路线时，该地群众曾提出意见，认为该地不能筑堤。但这个正确意见并未被采纳。当时，该运河工程主管部门已经发现有些问题，但没有继续研究和考查，就冒然作了决定，这是完全错误的，这个严重的教训，值得各地深刻记取。
