　　No construction without engineering design!
　　Shortcomings in Projects Handled by the Beijing Municipal Health Engineering Bureau
    Over 500 Meters of Sewer Line are Ineffective
    Beijing Paper Mill's Letter to the Editor:
    After reading the People's Daily editorial "No construction without engineering design" on the 16th and the report on the failure of the water source project at the Andong Smelting Plant on the 17th, we deeply feel that basic construction projects must have thorough prior surveys and designs and must be implemented step by step; otherwise, it will cause serious losses to the people's property. Our paper mill's external sewer project in Beijing also made the same kind of mistake, which gave us a great lesson. This matter has not been completely resolved yet. We work hard on production, wanting to hand in more profits to the state; we participate in donations and voluntary overtime, wanting to produce more wealth for the country. But just one construction rework will waste billions of yuan of state funds, which is a real pity. The rework situation of our factory's sewer project is worth introducing as a lesson. Our factory is a paper mill, and we use a lot of water. Since the period of enemy occupation, there has been no sewer equipment, and all drainage used to flow along the terrain into the fields southeast of the factory, harming farmland. In winter, when the ground freezes, the flooded area is even wider, causing even greater harm.

    After the liberation of Beijing, our factory believed that this should be resolved as soon as possible. After our factory added machines, the amount of drainage was even greater, and the sewage overflowed directly into Tong County. In April 1950, the affected farmers repeatedly requested water management, and the Central Ministry of Light Industry approved it and sent a letter to the Beijing Municipal Health Engineering Bureau on June 1st to assist in the solution, with the design and construction being the responsibility of the bureau. Construction started on October 20th and was completed on November 10th.

    The sewer line is 520 meters long, and the total cost was 160 million yuan. However, less than a month after completion, the sewer line experienced backflow. The bureau initially thought that a section of the pipe had subsided, but after repairs were ineffective, Zou Youzhi from the bureau's design section and Liu Xun, the chief engineer of the engineering team, came to survey again on March 17th and concluded that the pipe diameter was too small, resulting in insufficient flow. It is necessary to re-install a larger pipe. An additional 400 million yuan or more is needed. Because the cost is too high, the engineering problem has not been resolved to this day.

    We also failed to fulfill our responsibilities in terms of review and supervision of this failed project, but this loss is very painful.

### 北京卫生工程局经办工程中有缺点  五百余公尺下水道失效  北京造纸厂来信报告

　　没有工程设计就不可能施工！
　　北京卫生工程局经办工程中有缺点        
    五百余公尺下水道失效        
    北京造纸厂来信报告编辑同志：
    十六日读了人民日报“没有工程设计就不可能施工”的社论，十七日又读了安东冶炼厂水源工程遭受失败的报道，使我们深切感觉，基本建设工程必须事前有周密的勘察设计，而且必须是步步踏实；否则会给人民财产造成严重损失。我们北京造纸厂的厂外下水道工程也犯了同样性质的错误，给我们很大的教训。这事直到现在尚未完全解决。我们辛辛苦苦搞生产，想多交些上交利润；搞捐献，搞义务加班，想为国家多生产些财产。可是只要一次工程反工，就会浪费国家亿万的资金，实属可惜。我厂下水道工程反工情况，值得介绍出来作为教训。我厂是造纸厂，用水很多。自敌伪时期以来，向无下水道设备，所有排水，过去均顺地势流入厂东南方田地中，为害农田，冬季地冻，水淹地区更宽，为害更大。
    北京解放后，我厂即认为对此应及早解决。我厂添设机器后，排水量更大，下水泛滥直达通县境。一九五○年四月被害农民纷纷请求治水，中央轻工业部乃加批准，并于六月一日去函北京市卫生工程局请协助解决，设计施工则皆由该局负责。十月二十日开工，十一月十日完工。
    下水道全长五百二十公尺，全部费用为一亿六千余万元。但完工不及一月，下水道即发生倒流现象。该局最初以为是管身一部下陷，但修理无效后，三月十七日该局设计科邹有志及工程总队主任工程师刘训经，又来勘察，始认为是水管口径过小，以致流量不足。须要重新设置大管。另须经费四亿元以上。因经费甚大，工程问题至今日尚未解决。
    对于这个失败的工程，我们在审核监察方面也未尽到责任，但这种损失是很痛心的。
                                    北京造纸厂  六月十七日
