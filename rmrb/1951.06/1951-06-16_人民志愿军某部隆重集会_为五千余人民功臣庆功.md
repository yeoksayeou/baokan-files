Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 15th: A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army solemnly held a celebration and commendation conference on the 6th of this month to commend a large number of People's Heroes and People's Meritorious Servants who have made immortal achievements in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. The beautiful five-star red flag of the motherland and the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fluttered over the venue. People of all ethnic groups, government organs at all levels, and the army and navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army sent a large number of silk banners, congratulatory banners, and congratulatory letters from provinces and cities such as Xinjiang, Fujian, Hubei, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, and Chongqing. Many silk banners and congratulatory banners were inscribed with words such as "Bringing Glory to the Motherland," "The People's Backing, the Motherland's Glory," and "The Banner of Justice, the Fortress of Peace." Since entering Korea, all commanders and fighters of the unit have crossed snow-capped mountains and icy rivers, overcoming all difficulties, and have repeatedly created examples of battles in which a large number of enemies were killed or wounded at extremely low cost with heroic and resourceful fighting. In combat, the unit produced 5,862 meritorious personnel and 102 meritorious units. Among them, the "Iron Blood Mountain" Hero Company of a certain unit defeated six attacks by an enemy regiment supported by a large number of aircraft and tanks with only one platoon. The Special Merit Company of a certain unit, led by Wang Yougen, a Volunteer Army hero who was recently invited to the Soviet Union to attend the National Day celebrations, annihilated three enemy companies. The lone hero Cui Yingshan captured nine American soldiers single-handedly and unarmed through his wit. The Great Merit Fourth Company of a certain unit braved temperatures of minus 40 degrees Celsius, climbing an 80-degree steep slope through the snow to capture Hua Yue Mountain and break through the enemy's 38th parallel defense line. The First Platoon of the Fifth Company of a certain unit destroyed 48 American vehicles and killed more than 60 American soldiers. The "Steel Wang Rong Squad" defended Wuyin Mountain for three days and three nights, killing or wounding 300 enemies. Special Merit Hero Zhang Xuji captured five enemy bunkers in ten minutes, annihilating an enemy platoon. There were also rescue heroes like "Human Stretcher" Xie Gangdan, and soldiers like Xiu Maozhen who protected the interests of the Korean people. The meritorious personnel who attended the meeting systematically summarized many successful experiences in annihilating the enemy. Finally, all the meritorious personnel jointly wrote a letter to their superiors, expressing their determination to use greater victories and merits in performing new tasks to repay the support and love of the people of the motherland and the Korean people, and to win greater glory for the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 10th: Many meritorious personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have expressed their determination to use even greater victories to repay the love of the people of the motherland after receiving warm greetings from the people of the motherland. Chen Xiwu, a meritorious mortar shooter of a certain unit, once created an outstanding record of seven hits out of seven shots in combat. This time, the delegation from the motherland presented him with a commemorative medal with Chairman Mao's image and a watch. After receiving the gifts from the people of the motherland, Chen Xiwu signed a pledge, promising to continue to carry forward the spirit of resolute, brave, and tenacious fighting, and to make contributions to the motherland.

Liu Wenkui, Du Tinggui, Ding Kequan, and Fang Yuhong, the four heroes who made outstanding contributions in the battle to capture Hill 702 north of Huachuan on April 24th, called the fountain pens that the delegation presented to each of them "victory pens sent by the people of the motherland." Du Tinggui, who killed or wounded more than 70 enemies in battle, said: "When I was in the motherland, I was determined to come to Korea and make great contributions. The achievements I have made this time do not count. I will make more contributions to the Chinese and Korean people in the next battle." His comrade-in-arms Ding Kequan said: "I have experience in fighting tanks, and I will definitely make contributions in fighting tanks next time." He added: "We cannot use the pen sent by the people of the motherland for nothing. I must strive to annihilate more American devils to repay the love of the people of the motherland." The heroes excitedly used their "victory pens" to write down their new plans to make contributions.

Jia Jinxiang and Yu Kun, meritorious personnel of another Volunteer Army unit, wrote a letter of determination to their superiors with the fountain pens given to them by the people of the motherland, saying: "We have only made a small contribution, and we are really ashamed to accept such grand gifts from the people of the motherland. We are determined to annihilate more enemies and capture more prisoners in future battles, and to maintain and carry forward our past glory."

All the commanders and fighters of a certain Volunteer Army unit wrote a letter thanking the love of the people of the motherland, and firmly stated that they would create more heroic deeds and annihilate more enemies in the future, and would never return to the country until the entire Korea was liberated. The letter concluded: "Please rest assured, people of the motherland, we will definitely complete the task victoriously. Please wait to hear our victory news!"

Many units have also written letters back to the motherland, expressing their desire to repay the care and love of the people of the motherland with even greater victories.
