　　Li Shunda Leads Xigou Village Masses
    Carrying Out Appraisal and Summary Movement to Promote Patriotic Production Increase Competition
    After the completion of spring plowing and sowing, the peasants in Li Shunda's village (Xigou Village, Pingshun County) immediately launched an appraisal and summary movement, which played a significant role in promoting the village's patriotic production increase competition.
    After the end of spring sowing, Li Shunda immediately convened a full meeting of the mutual aid team to check the implementation of various plans by the entire team and each household in accordance with the challenge plan to the national mutual aid teams. The specific contents of the inspection and appraisal included: 1. The size of the achievement in completing the plan; 2. The understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea and the patriotic labor attitude; 3. Unity and mutual assistance; 4. Technical skill; 5. Organizational leadership. At the same time, they also discussed the benefits and farming experience of the new-style single-handle plow, and carried out the work of rectifying the mutual aid team. Finally, Li Shunda, Lü Guilan (female), Ma Yuxing, and Lu Wenquan were selected as patriotic labor models for the entire team. Subsequently, other mutual aid teams in the village absorbed the experience of Li Shunda's mutual aid team and generally carried out appraisal and summary. After each team completed its appraisal, a judging committee composed of the team leaders and county, district, and village cadres was formed to conduct key random checks and democratic appraisals based on the results of each team's inspection. Then, the judging committee convened a village-wide meeting to report on the completion of plans by each team, advanced experiences, and patriotic labor deeds. Finally, the judging committee announced the overall evaluation results, publicly commended the three patriotic labor model mutual aid teams of Li Shunda, Song Jinshan, and Shen Angen, and the thirteen patriotic labor models such as Li Shunda and Zhang Huanglou, who had completed or exceeded the original plan, and criticized and educated individual backward mutual aid teams and peasants.
    Through this bottom-up mass appraisal and summary, Xigou Village strengthened everyone's understanding of the patriotic production increase competition. The five mutual aid teams participating in the competition have all formulated summer seedling protection plans for the entire team and each household, and have formulated summer competition conditions; in order to strengthen the education of resisting America and aiding Korea, the village's reading group increased from two to five, subscribed to five copies of the Shanxi Peasant Daily, and established a regular political and cultural learning system. In addition, each team focused on solving the important problems currently existing. For example, Zhang Donghai, a member of Fang Jusheng's mutual aid team, did not complete the fertilization plan for spring sowing and decided to make up for it in the summer. The newly formed Zhang Tudinger mutual aid team also put forward a summer production plan at the village-wide meeting and challenged Li Shunda's mutual aid team. In the inspection and appraisal, everyone realized the importance of improving agricultural technology. Some conservative team members saw that the land plowed by others using the new-style single-handle plow had particularly strong seedlings. Therefore, they also requested to purchase and use new-style agricultural tools.

　　李顺达带动西沟村群众
    开展评比总结运动  推进爱国丰产竞赛
    李顺达所在村（平顺县西沟村）全村农民于完成春耕播种后，立即开展评比总结运动，对推动全村爱国丰产竞赛运动作用很大。
    该村春播结束后，李顺达即召开互助组全组会议，按照向全国互助组的挑战计划，检查了全组及各户对各项计划的执行情况。检查评比的具体内容有：一、完成计划的成绩大小；二、对抗美援朝的认识和爱国主义劳动态度；三、团结互助；四、技术好坏；五、组织领导。同时又座谈了新式单把犁的好处和耕作经验，并进行了整顿互助组的工作。最后评选出李顺达、吕桂兰（女）、马玉兴、路文全四人为全组的爱国劳动模范。接着全村其他互助组吸取李顺达互助组的经验，普遍进行评比总结。各组评完后，由各组组长和县区村干部共同组成评判委员会，根据各组检查的结果，进行重点抽查、民主评判。接着，评判委员会便召开全村大会，报告各组完成计划的情况、先进经验和爱国劳动事迹。最后，由评判委员会宣布总评结果，对完成或超过原计划的李顺达、宋金山、申安根三个爱国劳动模范互助组和李顺达、张黄楼等十三个爱国劳动模范进行了当众表扬，对个别落后的互助组和农民进行了批评教育。
    西沟村经过这次自下而上的群众性的评比总结，加强了每个人对爱国丰产竞赛的认识。该村参加竞赛的五个互助组都订出全组和各户的夏季保苗计划，并拟定了夏季竞赛条件；为着加强抗美援朝的教育，该村读报组由两个增至五个，订购山西农民报五份，并建立了经常的政治文化学习制度。此外，各组并有重点地解决了当前存在的重要问题。如方聚生互助组组员张东孩未完成春播的施肥计划，决定夏季补齐。该村新组成的张秃顶互助组，在全村大会上亦提出夏季生产计划，向李顺达互助组应战。在检查评比中，大家更认识到改进农作技术的重要。有些守旧的组员看到别人使用新式单把犁耕过的地，出土禾苗长得分外茁壮。因此，他们也要求购买和使用新式农具。
