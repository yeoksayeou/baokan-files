Following the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the patriotic enthusiasm of stevedores across the country has greatly increased. Currently, 369 cities nationwide have established stevedore trade union organizations. Among the 125 cities that had previously abolished feudal control systems, mass accusations and denunciations led to public trials and suppressions by the government, clearing out hidden counter-revolutionary elements and uncovering several secret agent organizations, thereby purifying and consolidating the trade union organizations. In cities that had not yet abolished feudal control systems, movements to suppress counter-revolutionary elements and oppose feudal headmen are underway. Through this movement, a large number of counter-revolutionary elements and reactionary feudal headmen have been cleared out. Accepting the demands of the workers, local people's governments have sentenced a small number of the most heinous counter-revolutionaries to death, while others have been sentenced to imprisonment or placed under surveillance, or are currently under trial. In dealing with counter-revolutionary elements laden with blood debts, local people's governments have convened mass public trial and accusation meetings. After the public trial and execution of the secret agent headman Yan Yingnan in Nanning, Guangxi, workers said, "We never dreamed that Yan Yingnan, who was once so powerful, would have such a day." Workers in various places generally reflected, "Our revenge has been avenged."

After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the patriotic sentiment of the workers has greatly increased. In order to safeguard their hard-won victories, workers have universally organized workers' pickets. The Rugao worker picket team, originally with 55 members, has now increased to more than 150. They cooperate with public security forces in guarding posts and sentry duties, and have uncovered secret agents who forged seals. The Wuhan worker picket team takes turns guarding warehouses and docks, strictly preventing spies and saboteurs. They once discovered explosive materials such as mines and torpedoes being smuggled by secret agents on a wooden boat carrying scrap iron. The cart drivers in Boshan, Shandong, when inspecting the patriotic pact, discovered that the clause "Provide manpower and money to support Korea" had not been well implemented. Immediately, 23 people signed up to join the Aid Korea transportation team, 51 were willing to provide livestock, and 28 were willing to provide carts. Currently, in order to respond to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, stevedores in various places are widely launching a movement to donate airplanes and cannons.

　　经过镇压反革命运动
    全国各地搬运工人爱国热情空前提高
    大张旗鼓地镇压反革命之后，全国搬运工人的爱国热情大为提高。目前全国已有三百六十九个城市建立了搬运工会组织。其中一百二十五个过去已废除封建把持制度的城市，经过群众的检举、控诉，政府的公审、镇压，清除了暗藏的反革命分子，破获了若干特务组织，因而纯洁、巩固了工会组织。过去未废除封建把持制度的城市，正在开展镇压反革命分子与反对封建把头的运动。经过这一运动，又清出大批反革命分子与反动的封建把头。各地人民政府接受工人的要求，已将少数罪大恶极的反革命分子判处极刑，其余或判处徒刑，或加以管制或正在审讯处理。在处理血债累累的反革命分子时，各地人民政府都召开了群众性的公审控诉大会。广西南宁公审枪毙了特务把头颜英南后，工人说：“我们作梦也想不到势大如天的颜英南，会有这么一天。”各地工人普遍反映：“我们的仇报了。”
    镇压反革命以后，工人的爱国情绪大为提高。工人们为了保卫自己的胜利果实，普遍地组织起工人纠察队。如皋工人纠察队原五十五人，现已增加一百五十多人。他们配合公安部队站岗放哨，曾查获伪造印信的特务。武汉工人纠察队轮流放哨保卫仓库、码头，严防奸细破坏分子。他们曾在装运废铁的木船上，查获特务私运的水雷、鱼雷等爆炸物。山东博山的马车工人，在检查爱国公约时，发现“出人出钱，支援朝鲜”这一条未做好，当即有二十三人报名参加援朝运输队，五十一人愿出牲口，二十八人愿出车。目前各地搬运工人为了响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，正广泛展开捐献飞机大炮运动。
