　　Innkeeper Captures Special Agent
    Tang Chunlong has been running the Longquan Inn outside the east gate of Suining County, northern Sichuan, for three years. He is an active participant in the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began in Suining County, he became even more cautious in receiving traveling merchants.
    On March 11th, a traveler named Han Futian came to the Longquan Inn. He spoke with an accent from another province but wrote "Chongqing" on the traveler registration form. Boss Tang casually asked him, "Your accent sounds like you're from another province, how do you say you are from Chongqing?" Han Futian stammered and looked alarmed. Boss Tang became suspicious, but he was busy going out to participate in study sessions, so he didn't pursue the matter further.
    When he returned home from the study session, it was already late at night. He had just gotten into bed when he thought of the suspicious traveler, Han Futian. He thought: Recently, the government has been calling for the capture of special agents, and everyone has a responsibility to investigate and pay attention to suspicious people. He immediately got out of bed and peeked into Han Futian's room: the oil lamp was still lit, but the traveler and his small backpack were gone.
    It turned out that after Boss Tang left, Han Futian had paid the landlady, Tang Tian, for the room and slipped away when no one was paying attention.
    Seeing the traveler sneaking away, Boss Tang concluded that this guy was no good. He thought: Now that social order is stable and everyone is living and working in peace, we can't let these bad guys come and sabotage it again. So, he immediately woke up his family and they split up to hunt down the special agent. Boss Tang ran into the city and asked at each inn if they had seen someone matching Han Futian's description. The inn workers all said they had not seen such a person. This made Tang Chunlong sweat anxiously. Finally, he went to the Glorious Hotel, where worker Feng Qingquan said, "There is someone who looks similar, but he's not called Han Futian." So he led Tang Chunlong upstairs, pretending to go into the room to pour water, allowing Tang Chunlong to stand quietly outside the door and take a look: Tang Chunlong saw that it was indeed Han Futian. It turned out that after the special agent slipped out of the Longquan Inn, he changed his name to Wei Zhenye and checked into this hotel. Tang Chunlong was even more certain that he was a bad person, so he hurried to report to the public security police station. As a result, the public security officer found special agent documents in this person's hat. This special agent, who had fled from western Sichuan to Suining, finally fell into the hands of the people.
    Before liberation, Boss Tang had suffered persecution from special agents and bandits, and his business was difficult. Since liberation, traffic has been smooth, the number of traveling merchants has increased day by day, and his business has prospered. He has also participated in study sessions, and he recognizes that to protect a good life, he must assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The story of Boss Tang's heroic capture of a special agent quickly spread among the people, and the local public security organs also publicly commended him.

### 旅店老板捉特务

　　旅店老板捉特务
    唐春龙在川北遂宁县东门外公路旁开设龙泉小客栈已有三年。他在抗美援朝学习中是一个积极分子。遂宁县镇压反革命运动开始后，他就更谨慎地接待来往的客商。
    三月十一日，龙泉客栈来了一个叫韩甫田的旅客，说话是外省口音，但在旅客登记簿上却填写“重庆人”，唐老板顺口问他：“你的口音象外省人，怎么说是重庆人呢？”韩甫田言语支吾，面露惊色。唐老板怀疑起来，但又忙着要出门参加学习，也就没有多去追问了。
    当他学习回家时，已是二更了。他刚躺上床，就想起可疑的旅客韩甫田来。他想：最近政府号召捉特务，对可疑的人，人人有责任盘查注意。他随即起床，到韩甫田的房门口往里一瞧：油灯还亮着，可是旅客和他的小背包都不见了。
    原来在唐老板走后，韩甫田就向老板娘唐田氏付了房钱，趁大家不注意时溜走了。
    唐老板见旅客偷偷地溜走，就断定这家伙不是好人。他想：现在社会秩序安定，大家安居乐业，不能让这些坏家伙再来破坏。于是，他马上叫醒全家分头追寻特务。唐老板跑进城去，挨家地到各客栈问有没有见象韩甫田这模样的人。各客栈工友都说没有见这模样的人。这可把唐春龙急得只淌汗。最后，他走到光荣大旅社，工友冯清泉说：“模样相象的有一个，可不叫韩甫田。”于是他领着唐春龙上楼，装着进房倒开水，让唐春龙悄悄站在房门外瞧：唐春龙一瞧，果真就是那韩甫田。原来这特务从龙泉客栈溜出后，改名韦振业，又住进这个客栈来了。唐春龙更加肯定他是个坏人，就急忙往公安派出所报告。结果，公安员在这人的帽子里搜出了特务证件。这个从川西潜逃来遂宁的特务分子，终于落在人民的手里了。
    唐老板在解放前曾经受过特务匪徒的迫害，生意不好做。自从解放后，交通畅通了，来往客商一天比一天多，生意兴隆，自己又参加了学习，他认识了要保卫好日子，就要协助政府镇压反革命。唐老板英勇捉特务的故事很快被人们传开了，当地公安机关也公开表扬了他。
