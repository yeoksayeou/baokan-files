Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: The movement of the American people protesting the Supreme Court's approval of the judgment against the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party is developing.

According to a TASS dispatch from New York: The Executive Committee of the Fur Workers Union passed a resolution condemning the Supreme Court's decision and demanding that the court change its attitude. Speakers of various political views at the Executive Committee meeting unanimously agreed that the Supreme Court's decision threatens the democratic rights of the American people. Workers from more than 250 fur factories in New York also protested to Supreme Court Chief Justice Vinson and demanded a retrial of the case.

The organ of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the weekly "International Electrical News," published an editorial comparing the Supreme Court's decision to the judgments of German judges before Hitler came to power, and said that the American people must resolutely overturn this judgment.

The well-known black lawyer and New York City Judge Delaney pointed out in a speech that the Supreme Court's decision threatens every American. All Americans, even those fighting for civil rights and against discrimination against blacks, are in danger of being convicted of conspiracy.

In Chicago, some Protestant ministers also demanded a retrial of the case.

Even some bourgeois newspapers condemned the decision. "The Compass" pointed out that the decision threatens every American, who could be thrown into prison tomorrow for disagreeing. The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" accused this as an unprecedented restriction on the right to freedom of speech and thought in the United States.

On June 5, the New York "Daily Worker" distributed 100,000 leaflets entitled "Something That Concerns You," which included a statement by American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis. The leaflet emphasized that the court's decision is a blow to the fundamental democratic rights of all American citizens.

    美国人民抗议迫害美共领袖
    【新华社十二日讯】美国人民抗议最高法院批准对美国共产党十一名领袖的判决的运动在发展中。
    据塔斯社纽约消息：毛皮工人工会执行委员会通过决议，谴责最高法院的决定，并要求法院改变它的态度。在执委会会议上发言的各种政见的人一致认为，最高法院的决定威胁着美国人民的民主权利。纽约二百五十多家毛皮工厂的工人也向最高法院首席法官文生提出抗议，并要求重新审理这一案件。
    联合电气、无线电及机器工人工会的机关刊物《国际电气新闻》周刊发表社论，把最高法院的决定比之希特勒上台前德国法官的判决，并说，美国人民必须坚决推翻这个判决。
    著名黑人律师、纽约市法官德朗尼在一次演说中指出，最高法院的决定威胁着每一个美国人民，所有的美国人，甚至是因为争取公民权利和反对歧视黑人，都有以共谋犯罪为名被判罪的危险。
    在芝加哥，一些新教牧师也要求重新审理这一案件。
    甚至若干资产阶级的报纸也谴责这个决定。《指南针日报》指出，这个决定使每一个美国人都受到威胁，他们明天就可能因意见不同而被投入监狱。《圣路易邮报》指责这是美国对言论思想自由权利的空前限制。
    六月五日，纽约《工人日报》散发了十万份题为“与你们切身相关的事”的传单，其中附有美共总书记但尼斯的声明。传单强调指出，法院的决定是对全体美国公民基本民主权利的打击。
