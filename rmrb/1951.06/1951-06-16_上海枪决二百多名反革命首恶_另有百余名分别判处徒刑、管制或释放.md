　　Shanghai Executes Over Two Hundred Counter-Revolutionary Ring Leaders
    Over a Hundred Others Sentenced to Imprisonment, Supervision, or Released

    [This newspaper's Shanghai dispatch from the 15th at 23:00] The Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Public Security and Judicial organs recently reviewed another group of counter-revolutionary criminals arrested before April 27th. These counter-revolutionary cases have been reviewed by the Shanghai Municipal and District Counter-Revolutionary Case Review Committees, which put forward preliminary opinions, and then submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission for review and approval. The Shanghai Municipal Military Control Commission executed the judgments based on the severity of each crime. Among the 432 counter-revolutionary criminals, 284 were sentenced to death; 19 were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve to undergo forced labor reform to observe their subsequent behavior; 115 were sentenced to imprisonment, 12 were sentenced to supervised reform; and 2 were released on bail. Those sentenced to death were executed by firing squad today. The counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced to death were all heinous, blood-debt-laden despots and spies who seriously damaged the interests of the state and the people.
