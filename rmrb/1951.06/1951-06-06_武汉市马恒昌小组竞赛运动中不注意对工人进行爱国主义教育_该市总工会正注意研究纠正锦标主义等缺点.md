　　Wuhan's Ma Hengchang Group Competition Movement Neglects Patriotic Education for Workers
    The City's Federation of Trade Unions is Paying Attention to Studying and Correcting Shortcomings Such as Championism
    Since the Ma Hengchang Group competition movement was launched in Wuhan at the end of February this year, it has achieved considerable success in raising the awareness of employees, strengthening unity and mutual assistance, and improving technology. However, many problems have not been resolved in a timely manner, thus hindering the further development of the movement.
    The most important problem is that patriotic education among workers is not deep and regular enough, and some workers do not understand the political significance of the competition, so there is a championism mentality. For example, after the Yin Shanbo group of the Telecommunications Bureau competed, they made a mistake in March. Everyone felt that they would not be able to get the red flag anyway, so they lost their energy, and as a result, more and more mistakes were made. When the stevedore Chen Kun's team launched the competition, they heard that there was no collective labor model medal, so they stopped competing. Later, after current affairs studies and accusation meetings, their awareness was raised, and the competition was started.
    Another problem is that production management cannot keep up with the requirements of the competition, which hinders the development of the competition movement. The production plans of some units are poor, such as the Jianghan Shipyard, which only submitted the April plan on April 15th. The plan only vaguely stipulated a few points, making it difficult for workers to formulate group and individual plans. The organization of some production processes is not good, the various processes are not connected, and the management department is disconnected from the site. For example, the First Textile Company's coarse and fine yarn supply is not coordinated, sometimes there is too much coarse yarn, and sometimes it is not available. Some units do not have inspection records, or the records are incomplete. For example, in the First Textile Company, the yarn weighing is not accurate, and there are no statistics, so the results cannot be announced, which affects the workers' competitive spirit.
    Another problem is that the trade union's leadership over the competition is insufficient. One is that they only focus on cultivating key groups and do not take care of the general groups; the other is that they have not combined the competition with the current central work well, so that many groups participating in the competition have fallen into anarchy.
    In order to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions decided to carry out patriotic education regularly and deeply in the future to raise the political awareness of workers, and on this basis, carry out democratic movements, reform enterprises, and create conditions for large-scale competitions. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the competition movement, use the form of group representative meetings to regularly check the competition situation, promote advanced experience in a timely manner, and combine points and areas.

　　武汉市马恒昌小组竞赛运动中不注意对工人进行爱国主义教育
    该市总工会正注意研究纠正锦标主义等缺点
    武汉市自今年二月底展开马恒昌小组竞赛运动以来，在提高职工觉悟、加强团结互助、提高技术等方面，已获得不少成绩。但还有许多问题，没有及时解决；因此，阻碍了运动进一步的开展。
    最重要的一个问题，就是在工人中进行爱国教育不够深入和经常，有些工人还不了解竞赛的政治意义，因此，存在着锦标主义思想。如电信局殷善钹小组竞赛后，在三月份出了一个差错，大家觉得反正得不上红旗了，于是就散了劲，结果差错越出越多。搬运工人陈焜小队发动竞赛时，听说没有集体劳动模范奖章，就不赛了。后来经过了时事学习，开了控诉会，提高了觉悟，竞赛才搞起来。
    还有一个问题是生产管理跟不上竞赛的要求，阻碍了竞赛运动的开展。有些单位的生产计划性差，如江汉船舶三厂，四月十五日才交出四月份计划，计划中又只笼统地订了几条，使得工人订小组与个人计划发生困难。有些生产过程组织得不好，各个工序不衔接，管理部门与现场脱节。如第一纺织公司粗细纱供应不配合，有时粗纱过多，有时又供应不上。有些单位没有检查纪录，或者有纪录而不健全。如第一纺织公司，磅纱不精确，又没有统计，成绩公布不出来。影响了工人竞赛情绪。
    再有一个问题是工会对竞赛的领导不够。一种是只顾培养重点，没有照顾一般的小组；另一种是没有把竞赛和当前中心工作很好地结合起来，使得许多参加竞赛的小组陷于自流。
    为克服上述缺点，武汉市总工会决定今后要经常深入进行爱国主义教育，提高工人政治觉悟，并在这一基础上，开展民主运动，改革企业，为大规模竞赛创造条件。另方面要加强对竞赛运动的领导，运用小组代表会议形式，定期检查竞赛情况，及时推广先进经验，使点与面结合起来。
