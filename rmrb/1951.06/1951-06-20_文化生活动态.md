            Hebei Organizes Radios to Go to the Countryside for Propaganda
    Hebei Province's counties are organizing radios to go to the countryside to help farmers listen to the radio, and this method has achieved great results in deeply promoting Resist-America Aid-Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionary propaganda.
    Organizing radios to go to the countryside for propaganda is being carried out under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei People's Broadcasting Station. Radio operators and cadres from the propaganda and education departments form radio teams, carrying radios to the countryside to widely organize the masses to listen to the radio in cooperation with village cadres. Radio operators and village cadres also lead listeners in discussions based on the content of the broadcast. In late April, 67 counties in the province had a total of 116 radios going to the countryside, organizing 1,355 listening sessions, with 317,982 listeners. After listening to broadcasts about supporting the conclusion of a peace pact and opposing the United States' arming of Japan, more than 143,000 people held votes and signed their names. People in various places also listened to the recorded broadcasts of the people of Baoding and other cities denouncing counter-revolutionaries and the public trials of counter-revolutionaries, and many listeners immediately launched denunciations of counter-revolutionaries on the spot. The listening teams in various counties also listened to the speeches of provincial leaders on planting more cotton and building a prosperous country, which played a significant role in completing the cotton planting task.

            Yunnan Vigorously Develops Education for Ethnic Minorities
    The education事业 in ethnic minority areas of Yunnan Province has greatly developed under the support of the People's Government. More and more ethnic minority children are enrolling in schools. Before liberation, there were only 14 provincial elementary schools in ethnic minority areas of the province, but now there are 27. Lijiang County, where the Mosuo and Bai nationalities live, has established 352 elementary schools, with 11,000 students. The Wuding, Ning'er, and Qujing special districts also have 239 public and private ethnic minority elementary schools, with more than 12,000 students. These students include children from more than 30 ethnic groups, including the Miao, Yi, Hui, and Bo. Many areas that never had schools before have also newly established schools.
    People's Governments at all levels in Yunnan Province are leading the people of all ethnic groups to overcome various difficulties and further develop the cultural and educational undertakings of ethnic minorities, in order to meet the increasingly high cultural demands of all ethnic groups. Various places are opening ethnic minority teacher training classes to gradually solve the problem of the lack of ethnic minority teachers. In addition, the People's Government is compiling textbooks in their own languages for the Bo, Tibetan, Miao, Lisu, and other ethnic groups that already have written languages. Political and cultural textbooks compiled in Lisu by Bijiang County have been warmly welcomed by the Lisu people.
