　　The North China Institute of Agricultural Science Seeks Every Means to Increase Production
    Has Donated Nearly 100 Million Yuan in Cash
    After listening to the report of the representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, all comrades of the North China Institute of Agricultural Science unanimously responded to the call of the China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to donate airplanes and cannons. Comrade Jiang Mingchuan, 59, said at the staff meeting: "After listening to the report of the delegation representatives, I held a family meeting with my wife. I only have one daughter, and my wife and I love her the most. Six years ago, I received a demobilization allowance and bought one tael of gold, intending it for my daughter's university education. But the American devils invaded Korea, and my only daughter joined the volunteer army. Now my wife has taken out the gold she has saved for six years from the box and asked me to donate it to buy airplanes to fight the American devils. I have also decided to donate 100,000 yuan of my salary every month until the final victory of resisting America and aiding Korea." Youth League member Huang Peimin donated all his savings of 1.93 million yuan from six years of prize-winning savings and three gold rings. Entomology expert Cao Ji will donate all the royalties and royalties from his three pamphlets on agricultural pests and give the copyright to the Korean People's Army. All working comrades of the Institute's Compilation Committee decided to donate all their editing fees and part of their royalties, totaling 40 million yuan; they proposed to use their spare time to compile and write more articles; and organize authors and readers to actively participate in the movement to donate airplanes and cannons in their edited and published "Agricultural Science Newsletter," "Soviet Agricultural Science," and "Chinese Agricultural Research" and other publications. Comrades in the model group also decided to create a set of anatomical models of horses in their spare time; comrades in the Department of Physics and Chemistry are preparing to manufacture the insecticide "666 Emulsion." Everyone came up with many ways to increase production to donate weapons.
    As of the morning of June 7, the entire staff of the institute had donated more than 86.6 million yuan in cash and goods, one tael of gold, eleven gold rings, and thirty-three silver dollars.
