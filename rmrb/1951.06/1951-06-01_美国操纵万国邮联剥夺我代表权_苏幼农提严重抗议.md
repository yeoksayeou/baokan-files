Xinhua News Agency, 31st—Despite repeated protests and warnings from China's postal authorities, the Executive and Liaison Committee of the Universal Postal Union, this time, did not invite representatives from China to attend the meeting. Instead, it summoned representatives from the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group to attend the meeting illegally held in St. Gallen, Switzerland, on May 21st. Under the manipulation of the US representative, and disregarding the reasoned opposition of representatives from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the committee brazenly and illegally passed a resolution to deprive the postal authorities of the People's Republic of China of their right to representation in the Universal Postal Union. In response, Su Younong, Director of the General Postal Bureau of China, sent a telegram to the Universal Postal Union on May 31st, lodging a strong protest, and solemnly declaring: "The act of the Universal Postal Union in depriving the legal representatives of the postal authorities of the People's Republic of China of their right to representation violates the universal interests of communication between three-quarters of the world's population and one-quarter of the Chinese people, and undermines the basic principles of international cooperation that underlie the Universal Postal Convention. It therefore reduces a purely technical international organization to a despicable tool of US imperialism. The United States and its vassal states, as well as the Universal Postal Union authorities, must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom."

　　美国操纵万国邮联剥夺我代表权
    苏幼农提严重抗议
    【新华社三十一日讯】万国邮政联盟执行及联络委员会不顾我国邮政当局的屡次抗议与警告，此次竟未邀请我国代表参加，而叫国民党反动残余集团的代表出席，非法于五月二十一日在瑞士圣加稜召开会议。该会并在美国代表的操纵下，不顾苏联与捷克等国代表的据理反对，悍然非法通过了剥夺我中华人民共和国邮政当局在万国邮政联盟中的代表权的决议。我邮政总局局长苏幼农为此于五月三十一日致电万国邮政联盟，提出严重抗议，并郑重声明：“万国邮政联盟剥夺中华人民共和国邮政当局合法代表权的行为违背了全世界四分之三人口与占四分之一的中国人民间互相沟通的普遍利益，破坏了作为万国邮政公约之基础的国际合作的起码原则，因此把一个自称为纯粹技术性的国际组织降低为美帝国主义的可耻工具；美国及其仆从国家与万国邮政联盟当局应对由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任。”
