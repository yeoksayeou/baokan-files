　　Hold Large-Scale Demonstration Against Persecution
　　Protest the Sealing of Progressive Newspapers and Obstruction of People's Voting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 14th] According to TASS, Berlin: The people of Düsseldorf, a large industrial city in the Ruhr region of West Germany, recently held a grand demonstration to protest the recent atrocities of the American, British, and French occupying authorities and the Bonn "government" in sealing up a large number of progressive newspapers to obstruct the holding of people's votes. The demonstrators angrily shouted slogans such as "We want lasting peace, so down with Adenauer," "Down with unconstitutional bans," and "Long live the newspapers that support peace." They distributed tens of thousands of leaflets demanding an end to remilitarization. The police attempted to disperse the demonstrators but were driven back by the demonstrators and pedestrians. Traffic in the city center was cut off for an hour and a half.
    This demonstration was held under the call of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party. Recently, in order to prohibit the continuous holding of popular votes among the people of West Germany, the American, British, and French occupying authorities, in a fit of pique, successively ordered the "Freie Volkszeitung" (Free People's Newspaper), the central organ of the German Communist Party in Düsseldorf, the "Volksstimme" (People's Voice) in Cologne, and the "Volksecho" (People's Echo) in Detmold in the British occupation zone to suspend publication for forty days, and sealed up the "Wahrheit" (Truth) in Hanover; in the American occupation zone, they sealed up the "Volksstimme" (People's Voice) in Stuttgart; and in the French occupation zone, they sealed up the "Neues Leben" (New Life) in Ludwigshafen. The Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement strongly protesting and calling on the people to rise up and resolutely oppose it.

　　西德杜塞尔多夫人民
　　举行反迫害大示威        
    抗议查封进步报纸阻挠人民投票
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德鲁尔区大工业城市杜塞尔多夫的人民，日前举行了盛大的示威，抗议美、英、法占领当局与波恩“政府”最近曾查封大批进步报纸以阻挠进行人民投票的暴行。示威者愤怒地高呼：“我们要持久和平，所以要打倒阿登纳”、“打倒违背宪法的禁令”、“拥护和平的报纸万岁”等口号。他们散发了几万张传单，要求制止重新军国主义化。警察曾企图驱散示威者，但是被示威者和行人逐退。市中心的交通断绝达一个半小时之久。
    这次示威是在德国共产党中央委员会号召下举行的。最近以来，为了禁止在西德人民中不断地举行的人民投票，恼羞成怒的美、英、法占领当局，曾先后在英占区下令杜塞尔多夫的德共中央机关报《自由人民报》、科隆的《人民之声报》和德芒的《人民回声报》停刊四十天，并查封了汉诺威的《真实报》；在美占区查封了斯图加特的《人民之声》报；在法占区查封了路易港的《新生活报》。德共中央为此特发出声明，提出严正抗议，并号召人民起来坚决反对。
