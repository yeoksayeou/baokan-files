Beijing and Tianjin Launch Patriotic Donation Campaign
	Factory Workers Resolve to Increase Production and Purchase Planes and Cannons to Support the Front Lines

[Report from Our Newspaper] After hearing reports from representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to Offer Condolences and seeing the China Peace Committee's call for promoting patriotic covenants, donating airplanes and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers, workers and staff in the capital are responding to this great call with practical actions.

On June 2nd, after seeing the call from the China Peace Committee published in the newspaper, workers at the Shijingshan Power Plant excitedly proposed to strive to overfulfill production tasks with the spirit of "For every drop of sweat we shed, the volunteers will shed one less drop of blood." They determined a specific goal to strive for: to use excess production income to purchase a "Capital Power Plant" airplane and donate it to the Volunteer Army and the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, each employee group is preparing to launch a universal revision of the patriotic covenant movement in the near future, to more closely integrate its content with the current donation movement and their own production tasks.

Workers and staff at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant decided to do everything possible to support the Volunteer Army. They put forward the slogan "Let us shed more sweat in the rear, so that the front lines will shed less blood" and launched a donation campaign. Workshops and groups have supplemented and revised their patriotic covenants, formulating specific plans to ensure increased production. For example, the hot blast furnace group added conditions to respond to all calls from the China Peace Committee and to implement the challenge to the Ma Hengchang group. In terms of donations, some donated a certain amount of millet from their bonuses to the front lines, while others decided to donate a certain amount of millet per person per month until the end of the Korean War. After hearing the report from representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to Offer Condolences, workers and staff at the Liulihe Cement Plant learned about the hardships faced by the Volunteer Army fighting on the front lines in Korea, as well as the need for airplanes, cannons, and other weapons. At the meeting, 205 workers, staff, and family members donated money to buy airplanes and cannons. The plant's trade union, party general branch committee, and Communist Youth League branch also issued a call to all trade union members, party members, and League members. Workers and staff proposed that they would support the front lines with newer and greater achievements in production in the future. The burning workshop first proposed to raise the operating rate to 94% (exceeding the quota) and the attendance rate to 98% (originally less than 90%) to challenge the entire plant as a practical action to support the front lines.

In order to respond to the call of the China Peace Committee, the 30 train crews of the Beijing Train Section are preparing to immediately start a campaign on the trains to encourage passengers to donate for an airplane. The workers at the Xizhimen dispatching room decided to load and unload timber in their spare time and donate all the wages earned. Yang Tingyao, a worker at the Beijing West Station Power Engineering Section, wrote a letter to mobilize all workers at the station to actively donate. The station's trade union also immediately convened a joint meeting of group leaders to discuss how to start checking the implementation of the patriotic covenant and studied the editorial in this newspaper on June 2nd on the spot. Upon seeing the call from the China Peace Committee, the workers at the Beijing Clothing Factory all said, "We must work hard to support the front lines. The sooner we drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of Korea, the sooner we can live a good life." Workers in the first and second sewing departments not only made donations but also said, "Resisting America and aiding Korea is a long-term task, and we must increase production and donate for a long time." Workers at the Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory listened to the report from representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to Offer Condolences on May 31st and expressed that they would refuel production to support the Korean front lines. They said, "We must do a good job and support the Volunteer Army until the American aggressors are eliminated." All three groups decided to donate a fixed amount every month. Workers and staff at the Beijing Electric Power Bureau called the trade union one after another, expressing their desire to immediately support the Korean front lines with actions. In addition to the donations from the Accounting Section Group, the Ma Zhongyan Group of the Cadre Section, and Comrade Gong Jianmin, the Stationery Warehouse Group and the Small Workshop Group have set out conditions to challenge the Ma Hengchang Group, using increased production to support the front lines. Employees of the Planning Office of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau initiated a campaign to donate for a "Postal and Telecommunications Worker" airplane. In addition to donating cash, the Fang Zenglin Group of the Water Meter Section of the Beijing Water Company proposed to complete their tasks at least two days ahead of schedule every month, guaranteeing that they would not be late or leave early for even a minute.

In addition, the employees of the Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau of the Military Commission, and the Planning Office of the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau enthusiastically responded to the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. The National Committee of the China Ordnance Industry Trade Union called on ordnance workers across the country to continue to deepen the patriotic labor emulation campaign, universally inspect and formulate patriotic covenants, and launch a patriotic movement to increase production and increase income, donating part or all of the newly increased income to purchase weapons such as airplanes, cannons, and tanks.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 2nd: People from all walks of life in Tianjin are enthusiastically responding to the China Peace Committee's call for promoting patriotic covenants, donating airplanes and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: The industrial and commercial circles of Tianjin have had many model examples in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. In order to maintain our honor, on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles of Tianjin, I respond to the call of the China Peace Committee to universally launch a movement to donate airplanes and cannons to support our heroic Volunteer Army! Luo Yun, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, called on women throughout the city to increase production, save and donate, better help the families of martyrs and soldiers solve their difficulties, and conscientiously implement patriotic covenants.

The people of the city are responding to the call of the China Peace Committee with practical actions. Workers and staff of the Water Company decided to further develop patriotic emulation and strive to overfulfill production tasks. The Wang Chunde Model Group of the company's river water plant also voluntarily proposed to revise the original quota; for example, the original quota for repairing boilers was 30 workdays, but it has now been changed to 27 workdays. Workers and staff of the joint venture underwear factory decided to work overtime without pay for one day this Sunday and donate all the income. After seeing the call from the China Peace Committee in the newspaper, the Model Second Production Group of the Third Sewing Department of the Tianjin Clothing Factory increased their daily output by 11% that day, and the return rate of defective products was reduced from 4% to 2%. Workers of the Third Branch of the Dockworkers' Union donated more than 13 million yuan that day. Many factory workers voluntarily requested to donate part of their monthly salary until the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

Many government officials and citizens have also automatically launched donation movements. The seven young heroes, including Hu Chengzhi, who captured spies, called on children throughout the city to save money from sweets to buy airplanes and cannons. The Potaizhuang Police Station guaranteed to do a good job in the work of military families, to ensure that the children of military families are enrolled in school and to solve the employment and livelihood problems of military families.
