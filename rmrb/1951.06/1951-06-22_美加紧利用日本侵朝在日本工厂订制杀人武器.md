Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: The U.S. imperialists are using Japanese reactionaries as accomplices in the Korean War. According to materials from the Yoshida government's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, since the invasion of Korea, up to June 3rd, the total amount of contracts signed by the U.S. military with Japan under the name of "special needs" reached 300.6 million U.S. dollars, of which military supplies accounted for 210 million U.S. dollars, and labor services (i.e., fees paid to Japanese people serving the U.S. military invading Korea) accounted for 91 million U.S. dollars.

Many Japanese factories are manufacturing murderous weapons for the U.S. military invading Korea. For example, many of the napalm bombs used by the United States to burn down peaceful Korean cities and villages are manufactured in Japanese factories. Since February of this year, the U.S. occupation authorities have placed orders for 38,500 napalm bombs with companies such as "New Japan Trading," "Fuji Vehicle," and "Japan Construction." In addition, "Kogei," "Kyouwa," "Tama Automobile," "Naiwai Trading," "Daiichi Trading," and other companies received orders from the United States on March 22nd for 18,000 napalm bomb casings.

In addition to the above-mentioned companies, the following Japanese trading companies have also received orders for the manufacture of napalm bombs: "Nissan Motor," "Ishii Iron Works," "Mitaka," "Tachikawa," "Nippon Radiator," "Teikoku Automobile," "Fuji Industries," "Nakanippon Heavy Industries" (in Otsuka and Oi) companies, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: U.S. Air Force Secretary Finletter admitted that the United States is illegally using former Japanese aircraft factories to serve the Korean War. Finletter recently made an eight-day inspection trip to inspect the activities of the U.S. invading Korean Air Force. He revealed when he returned to Washington on the 16th that when he was in Japan, he inspected the U.S. Far East Air Force Ordnance Department, "which is using many old Japanese aircraft factories." Finletter said: "Those aircraft factories are there repairing aircraft, manufacturing replacement parts, and there are many Japanese workers."

　　美加紧利用日本侵朝在日本工厂订制杀人武器
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：美帝国主义者利用日本反动派充当侵朝战争的帮凶。据吉田政府通商产业省的材料，自侵朝战争以来，至六月三日为止，侵朝美军以“特别需要”的名义与日本所签订的合同，总计达三亿零六百余万美元，其中军事物资为二亿一千余万美元，劳务（即付给替侵朝美军服务的日人的费用）为九千一百余万美元。
    许多日本工厂都在为侵朝美军制造杀人武器。例如，美国用来焚烧朝鲜和平城市与村庄的凝固汽油弹，有许多都是日本工厂制造的。从今年二月以来，美国占领当局已向“新日本通商”、“富士车辆”、“日本建设”等公司提出订制凝固汽油弹三万八千五百枚的订单。此外，“工艺”、“共和”、“多摩（译音）汽车”、“内外通商”、“第一通商”和其他公司又在三月二十二日收到美国订制一万八千个凝固汽油弹弹壳的订单。
    除了以上所说的各公司以外，下列各日商公司也已经收到制造凝固汽油弹的订单：“日产汽车”、“石井铁工所”、“三鹰”、“立川”、“日本散热器”、“帝国汽车”、“富士产业”、“中日本重工业”（在大冢和大井两地）公司等。
    【新华社二十日讯】华盛顿消息：美国空军部长芬立脱承认美国正非法使用前日本飞机工厂为侵朝战争服务。芬立脱最近曾作了八天的视察旅行，视察美国侵朝空军的活动。他在十六日回到华盛顿时透露，当他在日本时，他曾视察美国远东空军军需部，“它正在使用许多旧日本飞机工厂”。芬立脱说：“那些飞机工厂在那儿修理飞机，制造更换的零件，并有许多日本工人。”
