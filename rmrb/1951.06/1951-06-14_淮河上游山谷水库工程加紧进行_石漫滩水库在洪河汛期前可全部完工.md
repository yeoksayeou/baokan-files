Intensifying the Construction of Valley Reservoirs in the Upper Reaches of the Huai River
Shimantan Reservoir Expected to Be Completed Before the Flood Season of the Hong River

	With the flood season of the Huai River approaching, the construction of valley reservoirs in the upper reaches of the Huai River is being intensified.
	Building valley reservoirs is one of the important projects for fundamentally controlling the Huai River. The valley reservoirs that have started construction in the upper reaches of the Huai River this spring include three sites: Shimantan, Baisha, and Banqiao. The Shimantan Reservoir can store 47 million cubic meters of water and irrigate approximately 30,000 mu of farmland. The Baisha Reservoir has a storage capacity of approximately 180 million cubic meters and can irrigate 400,000 mu of farmland (previously incorrectly stated as 1 million mu). The Banqiao Reservoir can store 120 million cubic meters of water and can irrigate 200,000 mu of farmland.
	The above three reservoirs all started key construction in late March this spring and fully commenced construction in early April. Due to the larger scale of the Baisha and Banqiao reservoirs, only a portion can be completed before the arrival of the summer flood season. Currently, the Henan Huai River Control Headquarters is concentrating all efforts on leading the civilian laborers to rush to build the Shimantan Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Hong River. Since the full-scale commencement of construction of the Shimantan Reservoir in early April, the project has progressed quite rapidly due to the efforts of 18,000 civilian laborers and many engineers, technicians, and cadres. As of April 29th, the 85-meter-long mountain tunnel (i.e., the water diversion tunnel) at the front of the reservoir had been excavated, and the tunnel walls are now being built with cement and stone. The foundation cleaning of the 450-meter-long, over 100-meter-wide, and 22-meter-high earthen dam, used to block and store floodwaters between the two mountain peaks, has long been completed, and the dam body has been built to a height of 17 meters. Currently, 1,200 stonemasons are working day and night using explosives to excavate the spillway. Shovels, earth-dumping trucks, bulldozers, and loaders are running non-stop on the construction site. The light railways surrounding the construction site have been laid, and 180 dump trucks slide back and forth on the rails all day long, transporting earth.
	In order to speed up the progress of this reservoir project, since late May, another 14,000 civilian laborers, two generators, dozens of earth-moving machines, 400 frame carts (a type of handcart, used for pushing earth), and 250 dump trucks for use on the light railways have been added to the construction site. All the civilian laborers have been working in two shifts, day and night, non-stop, since May 29th. In addition, over a hundred ox carts and horse carts near the construction site have also been organized, and these ox carts and horse carts transport dozens of tons of equipment to the construction site every day. It is estimated that this project can be fully completed before the arrival of the Hong River flood season this summer. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 淮河上游山谷水库工程加紧进行  石漫滩水库在洪河汛期前可全部完工

　　淮河上游山谷水库工程加紧进行        
    石漫滩水库在洪河汛期前可全部完工
    淮河汛期将到，淮河上游的山谷水库工程，正在加紧进行。
    修建山谷水库，是根治淮河的重要工程之一。今年春季淮河上游已兴工的山谷水库，有石漫滩、白沙、板桥等三处。石漫滩水库可蓄水四千七百万立方公尺，灌溉农田三万亩左右。白沙水库畜水量约一亿八千万立方公尺，可灌溉农田四十万亩。（前误为一百万亩）。板桥水库可蓄水一亿二千万立方公尺，可灌溉农田二十万亩。
    上述三座水库都先后在今春三月下旬开始重点施工，至四月初全面动工。白沙和板桥两水库因规模较大，故今夏洪水汛期到来前只能完成一部分。现在，河南治淮指挥部正集中全力领导民工赶建洪河上游的石漫滩水库。石漫滩水库从四月初全面动工后，由于一万八千民工和许多工程人员、技术工人和干部的努力，工程进展相当迅速。至四月二十九日，水库前八十五公尺长的穿山隧洞（即输水洞），已经凿通，现正在用洋灰、石块砌筑洞壁。两座山头之间用以拦蓄洪水的一条四百五十公尺长、百多公尺宽、二十二公尺高的土坝，坝基清理工作早已完成，坝身已筑到十七公尺高了。一千二百名石工目前正日夜用炸药开凿溢洪道。工地上的铲运机、卸土车，以及推土机、装土机等日夜不停地开动着。环绕工地四周的轻便铁轨已经铺好，每天有一百八十辆斗车整日滑行在铁轨上往来运土。
    为了加快这座水库工程的进行，五月下旬起，工地上又增加了一万四千民工，和两部发电机、数十部运土机、四百辆架子车（一种人力车，推土用），以及二百五十辆在轻便铁路上用的斗车。全体民工从五月二十九日起分日夜两班，昼夜不停地工作。此外，工地附近还有百多辆牛车和马车也已组织起来，这些牛车和马车，每日要将数十吨重的器材源源运到工地。估计这一工程在今夏洪河汛期到来以前，可以全部完工。（新华社）
