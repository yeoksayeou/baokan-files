Xinhua News Agency Report: The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation (IDWF) continued its meeting in Sofia on the 21st, hearing and discussing the report of the IDWF Investigation Team on the Atrocities of U.S. and British Troops in Korea. Mrs. Rommelaere, head of the investigation team, said: In the twelve days in Korea, we saw towns and cities, large and small, almost completely destroyed. We saw prisons with bloodstains on the walls, kilns where Korean people were burned alive, and mass graves. We heard the accusations of people who had been tortured and accusations of appalling atrocities. We cannot but come to the conclusion that the Americans waging an unjust war have become beasts.

During the discussion of the investigation team's report, women representatives from various countries expressed their boundless indignation at the atrocities committed by the U.S. aggressors and their accomplices. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution stating that the investigation team had irrefutably confirmed the appalling atrocities committed by the U.S. troops in Korea under the banner of the United Nations. All people in all countries should know the documents of the investigation team. The meeting recommended that national democratic women's organizations in all countries whose governments support the U.S. troops in Korea should send delegations to their governments to present the documents of the investigation team, demanding that all criminals be punished and that troops be withdrawn from Korea. The member organizations of the IDWF in various countries should cooperate with other women's organizations and peace-loving people's organizations to organize widespread protest movements against the atrocities of the U.S. troops in Korea, and to organize mass protest movements against the persecution of the members of the investigation team, especially against the British government's persecution of Mrs. Felton. The resolution concluded with a call for a large-scale fundraising campaign to collect clothing, medicines, condensed milk, cash, etc., to aid the Korean people and Korean children.

Based on the suggestion of the Italian delegation, the meeting decided to write to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, the President of the Security Council, and the United Nations Secretariat. The letter stated that the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation, uniting 91 million women, requests the United Nations to organize: (1) an immediate halt to the bombing of Korean cities and villages; (2) the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, allowing the Korean people to resolve their internal affairs themselves; (3) an acceleration of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the manner indicated by the World Peace Council resolution. The Executive Committee requests that, in accordance with the Allied Declaration of 1943, those responsible for crimes against the Korean people, especially MacArthur and Ridgway, be declared war criminals and handed over to the International Court of Justice for trial in accordance with the same declaration. The Executive Committee, representing all women and mothers, requests that the investigation team's report and documents be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion and that a delegation from the IDWF be allowed to attend the meeting to discuss this issue.

    坚主制裁美侵朝战犯
    号召开展捐献运动支援朝鲜人民
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会索非亚会议二十一日继续开会，听取并讨论了国际民主妇联侵朝美、英军暴行调查团的报告书。调查团团长罗德夫人说：在朝鲜的十二天，我们看到几乎完全毁灭了的大小城镇。我们看到墙上血迹斑斑的监狱，活活烧死朝鲜人民的窑洞，以及集体坟墓。我们听到受酷刑的人们的控诉，以及骇人听闻的暴行的控诉。我们不能不得出一个结论：进行着非正义战争的美国人已变成了野兽。
    在讨论调查团的报告书时，各国妇女代表对美国侵略者及其同谋者的暴行表示无限愤慨。会议一致通过决议说：调查团令人无可辩驳地证实了侵朝美军在联合国旗帜下干出来的骇人听闻的暴行。世界各国一切人民都应该知道调查团的文件。会议建议：凡本国政府支持侵朝美军的一切国家的全国性民主妇女团体，应推派代表团向本国政府提出调查团的文件，要求惩办一切罪犯，并且要求把军队撤离朝鲜。国际民主妇联的各国会员团体与其他妇女团体及主张和平的人民团体应当进行合作，组织广泛的抗议运动，抗议侵朝美军的暴行，并且要组织群众性的抗议运动，抗议迫害调查团的团员，特别是抗议英国政府迫害费尔顿夫人。决议最后号召大规模展开募捐运动，募集衣服、药品、炼乳、现金等援助朝鲜人民和朝鲜儿童。
    会议根据意大利代表团的建议，决定写信给联合国大会主席、安全理事会主席和联合国秘书处。这封信说：团结了九千一百万妇女的国际民主妇联执委会要求联合国组织：（一）立即制止对朝鲜城市乡村的轰炸；（二）一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让与朝鲜人民自行解决他们的内政问题；（三）按照世界和平理事会决议所指出的途径，加速朝鲜问题的和平解决。执委会要求按照一九四三年的同盟国宣言，宣布对危害朝鲜人民的罪行负责的人员特别是麦克阿瑟和李奇微为战争罪犯，并按照同一宣言把他们交付国际法庭审判。执委会代表一切妇女和母亲，要求把调查团的报告和文件提交联合国大会讨论，并要求国际民主妇联代表团能出席讨论这个问题的会议。
