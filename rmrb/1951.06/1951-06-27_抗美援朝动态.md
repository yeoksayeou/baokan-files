　　Resist America, Aid Korea Dynamics
    The Situation and Experience of the Patriotic Movement in Shandong Province

    By May 1st, in Shandong Province, excluding children under the age of seven and those with chronic illnesses, 80 to 90 percent of the population had received patriotic education. A total of 19 million people across the province participated in the May 1st grand demonstration. 23.77 million people, accounting for 57.3 percent of the province's population, participated in signing petitions to support the conclusion of a peace treaty and voting against the United States' arming of Japan. Before May 1st, 1,784 production teams in the province, totaling 15,300 workers, responded to the challenge of the Ma Hengchang team, and 250 mutual aid production teams responded to the challenge of the Li Shunda mutual aid team. This illustrates that the breadth and depth of patriotic education in Shandong Province has reached a significant scale.

    The main experiences of Shandong Province in carrying out patriotic education are: (1) The Chinese Communist Party committee takes responsibility, the whole party mobilizes, implements at each level, and is good at uniting and organizing all aspects of propaganda forces to carry out patriotic education, which is an important key to popularizing and deepening the patriotic movement. (2) Convening representative conferences for Resisting America and Aiding Korea is a good way to mobilize, organize, and launch the masses. This form has been widely used in various parts of Shandong and has achieved good results. (3) Organizing extensive propaganda teams at all levels, organizing accusation meetings to accuse the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, using exhibition forms to carry out propaganda for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and developing industrial and agricultural production, as well as organizing listening to the radio in the work of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, have all achieved great educational effects. (4) Mobilizing the masses to widely formulate patriotic covenants and regularly inspect the implementation of patriotic covenants is an important link in deeply educating the masses and long-term Resisting America and Aiding Korea.
  The Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Songjiang Province
    In Songjiang Province, all cities and villages held demonstrations and parades on May 1st, with a total of over 2,275,000 participants. The number of people who signed petitions in support of the peace treaty and voted against the United States' arming of Japan reached over 3,400,700, accounting for over 68 percent of the province's population. During the movement, a large number of propaganda teams were organized throughout the province. For example, the three cities of Harbin, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang, and the six counties of Shuangcheng, Tangyuan, and Ning'an organized more than 368 reporters. Among them, five cities and counties organized more than 19,000 propagandists and temporary propagandists, who went deep into the masses and conducted extensive publicity and education to the people through different methods such as symposiums, accusations, general meetings, and responsibility systems and contract systems for different areas and households. In the propaganda activities, various literary and artistic organizations and urban and rural artists were mobilized, which powerfully cooperated with the development of the movement. After this extensive publicity and education activity, people in various cities and counties of Songjiang widely formulated patriotic covenants. In Mudanjiang City alone, 155 units with more than 28,000 people formulated covenants.

　　抗美援朝动态
    山东省爱国运动的情况和经验
    山东各地的抗美援朝运动，到五月一日止，除七岁以下儿童和长年患病的人外，受到爱国教育的人数已达百分之八十至九十。全省参加“五一”大示威的共一千九百万人。参加签名拥护缔结和平公约和投票反对美国武装日本均达二千三百七十七万人，占全省人口百分之五十七点三。“五一”前，全省有一千七百八十四个生产小组共一万五千三百名工人向马恒昌小组应战，二百五十个生产互助小组向李顺达互助组应战。这说明山东省爱国主义教育的广度和深度，已达到很大的规模。
    山东省开展爱国教育的主要经验是：（一）中国共产党党委负责，全党动手，逐级贯彻并善于团结组织各方面的宣传力量，进行爱国主义教育，是普及深入爱国运动的重要关键。（二）召开抗美援朝代表会议，是动员组织与发动群众的一种很好的形式。山东各地普遍地运用了这一形式，都收到了良好的效果。（三）逐级组织广大宣传队，组织控诉会，控诉美、日帝国主义与蒋匪罪行，运用展览会形式进行抗美援朝、镇压反革命、发展工农业生产等项宣传以及在抗美援朝、镇压反革命工作中组织收听广播，均收到了极大的教育效果。（四）发动群众普遍订立爱国公约和定期检查爱国公约的执行，是深入教育群众、长期抗美援朝的重要环节。
  松江省的抗美援朝运动
    松江省各地所有的城市和乡村，在“五一”节都举行了示威游行，参加游行的人数共达二百二十七万五千余人。参加签名拥护和平公约和投票反对美国武装日本的人数达三百四十万零七千余人，占全省人口百分之六十八强。运动中，全省各地组织了大批的宣传队伍，如哈尔滨、佳木斯、牡丹江三市和双城、汤原、宁安等六个县即组织了三百六十八名以上的报告员，其中五个市县组织了宣传员和临时宣传员一万九千余人，深入群众，采取座谈、诉苦、大会报告及分片分户的责任制与包干制等不同方式方法，向人民群众进行了广泛的宣传教育。在宣传活动中并动员了各种文艺组织和城乡艺人，有力地配合了运动的开展。经过这一广泛的宣传教育活动，松江各市、县人民广泛订立了爱国公约。仅牡丹江一市即有一百五十五个单位共二万八千余人订立了公约。
