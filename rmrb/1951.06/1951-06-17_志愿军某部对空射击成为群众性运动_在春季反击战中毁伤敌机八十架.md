Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 16th: In the first and second stages of the spring counter-offensive, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers created a brilliant achievement by shooting down and damaging eighty enemy planes, including fifty-five shot down.

The unit's anti-aircraft shooting has become a mass movement. When advancing, the infantrymen composed anti-aircraft shooting techniques into clappers, learning as they walked. The anti-aircraft machine gunners named their published newspaper "Fire Net" and set out plans for hitting enemy planes. The will to avenge the Korean people motivated the soldiers. Heavy machine gunner Yang Degui once shot down a twin-engine medium bomber with ten bullets, while anti-aircraft machine gunner Qu Xiushan shot down an enemy plane with only three bullets. Qu Xiushan was a new anti-aircraft machine gunner; that was his first battle, and his shooting skills were not yet proficient. On that occasion, more than a dozen enemy planes indiscriminately bombed a peaceful village, setting the few thatched houses on fire, and the plowing cattle were bombed down in the turned-up black soil, and the peaceful Korean people were bombed to death beside the plow. Qu Xiushan was enraged. He waited until the enemy plane flew head-on before pulling the trigger. He fired three bursts and hit an enemy plane. A ball of fire burned in the air, and the American bandit fell down. In the five days after Qu Xiushan shot down the enemy plane, the soldiers in his class shot down four more enemy planes.

Due to the outstanding achievements of the unit's mass anti-aircraft shooting, the leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteers has issued a circular of commendation and awarded the unit a collective major merit.

　　志愿军某部对空射击成为群众性运动        
    在春季反击战中毁伤敌机八十架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十六日电】中国人民志愿军某部在春季反击战的第一、第二两阶段中，创造了击落、击伤敌机八十架的辉煌战果，其中被击落的有五十五架。
    该部的对空射击已经成为一种群众性的运动。在进军的时候，步兵们把对空射击的要领编成快板，边走边学。高射机枪射手们把自己出版的报纸定名为“火网”，并订出了打敌机的计划。替朝鲜人民复仇的意志激励着战士们。重机枪射手杨德贵曾用十发子弹击落一架双引擎中型轰炸机，而高射机枪射手屈秀善只用三发子弹就击落了一架敌机。屈秀善是一个新的高射机枪射手，那次是他第一次作战，他的射击技术还不熟练。那次，有十多架敌机向一个和平村庄滥施炸射，仅有的几间茅草房子被打着起火，正在犁地的耕牛被炸倒在翻起的黑土里，和平的朝鲜人民被炸死在犁铧旁边，屈秀善被激怒了。他等到敌机迎面飞来时，就扳动了机枪。他点射了三发子弹就把一架敌机打中了，空中烧起一团烟火，美国飞贼掉了下来。在屈秀善击落敌机以后的五天当中，和他同班的战士们又击落了敌机四架。
    由于该部的群众性的对空射击获得了卓越的成就，志愿军领导机关已经予以通报表扬，并给该部记集体大功一次。
