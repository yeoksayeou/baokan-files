To the Editor:

    The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's "Decision on Enrolling Students in Various Military Cadre Schools" has given students another opportunity to participate in the national defense construction of the motherland. This decision will surely be warmly welcomed by the students.

    I was originally a student at Nanchang No. 2 Middle School. Last year, when the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council decided to recruit young students and young workers to participate in military cadre schools, I responded to the call of the motherland and was honorably approved for admission. At that time, due to the limited number of places in military cadre schools, many students who applied were not approved; they had to wait for the next opportunity. Some students were not approved because their physical condition did not meet the requirements; they all firmly stated that they would work hard to improve their health and be ready to participate in the national defense construction of the motherland at any time. Today, the motherland is calling on our students to participate in military cadre schools. I think the students will jump for joy, warmly respond to this call, and enthusiastically sign up to participate in military cadre schools.

    After we enrolled, we came to Beijing to study. We live happily in the revolutionary family. The leaders care for us more than our mothers. The veteran comrades help us like older brothers and sisters. Everyone is united as one. Many comrades said: "The revolutionary family is so warm; the love in the past family was too narrow." Our life is intense and joyful. We attend lectures in the morning, discuss in the afternoon, and study on our own in the evening. We study politics and military affairs, and we carry out various recreational and sports activities. Strict military life has made the students more resilient. The students all said: "After participating in military cadre school, not only have we made progress in our thinking and learning, but our bodies have also become healthier."

    Come on, students! Let us work together to strengthen the national defense forces of the motherland and thoroughly defeat the aggression of imperialism.

### 我们在军事干部学校中生活紧张愉快进步很大

    我们在军事干部学校中生活紧张愉快进步很大编辑同志：
    中央人民政府政务院“关于各种军事干部学校招收学生的决定”，使同学们又一次得到参加祖国国防建设的机会。这个决定一定会得到同学们的热烈响应。
    我原是南昌市第二中学学生。去年中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院决定招收青年学生和青年工人参加军事干部学校的时候，我响应了祖国号召，光荣地被批准入学。那时，由于军事干部学校招生名额的限制，很多同学报了名没有被批准；他们只得等待着下一次的机会。有些同学因身体不合格没被批准；他们都坚决表示一定要努力锻炼身体，随时准备参加祖国的国防建设。今天，祖国正在号召我们同学参加军事干部学校。我想，同学们一定会高兴得跳起来，热烈响应这个号召，踊跃报名参加军事干部学校。
    我们入学后，就到北京来学习。我们愉快地生活在革命的大家庭里。首长爱护我们，比妈妈还要亲。老同志就像哥哥姐姐一样地帮助我们。大家团结得像一个人一样。很多同志都说：“革命大家庭是多么温暖，过去家庭的爱真是太狭小了。”我们的生活紧张愉快。我们上午上大课，下午讨论，晚上自习。我们学习政治、军事，并进行各种文娱、体育活动。严格的军事生活，使同学们锻炼得更坚强了。同学们都说：“参加军事干部学校以后，不但思想上、学习上进步了，身体也健康了。”
    同学们，来吧！让我们共同努力，加强祖国的国防力量，彻底打垮帝国主义的侵略。
