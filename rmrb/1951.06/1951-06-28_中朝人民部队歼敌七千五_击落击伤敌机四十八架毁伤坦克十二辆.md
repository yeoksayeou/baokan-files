Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 27th:

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, employing flexible tactics that combined blocking, counter-attacking, and ambushing, continued to inflict casualties on enemy forces. From June 16th to 20th, the Korean and Chinese People's forces eliminated another 7,513 enemy troops, including 5,285 killed or wounded from the Li pseudo-army and 1,920 from the US military; 308 US and Li pseudo-army soldiers were captured, including a US Air Force Captain pilot.

In counterattacks south of Kaesong, the Korean and Chinese People's forces decisively annihilated the majority of the two battalions of the Li pseudo-army's Youth Corps 1st Division and the Tongjin police force who had infiltrated the area. In addition to killing or wounding over a hundred, a total of 296 officers and soldiers, from company commander and platoon leader down to communication platoon leader, were captured. In blocking actions, examples of defeating the many with the few continued to emerge: In the battle to defend a certain high ground west of Geonbongsa Temple in Ganseong, a certain unit heroically repelled three attacks by superior forces of the Li pseudo-army, killing or wounding 439 enemy soldiers at the cost of 13 casualties. A small unit guarding a certain position north of Kimhwa calmly met the attack of an enemy company. The brave soldiers repelled two fierce attacks by the enemy with sudden, close-range firepower, killing or wounding over 30 enemies while suffering only two casualties, securing the position.

In these five days, anti-aircraft fire achieved even more brilliant results: a total of 28 enemy aircraft were shot down and 20 enemy aircraft were damaged, totaling 48. A certain unit's shooter, Wang Yongjiang, shot down a US jet fighter with three bullets fired from an automatic rifle captured from the US military. In these five days, we destroyed or damaged a total of twelve enemy tanks. Rocket launcher Zhu Youhan destroyed three US tanks with a US-made rocket launcher.

    击落击伤敌机四十八架毁伤坦克十二辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军以阻击、反击、袭击相配合的灵活战法，继续杀伤敌军。从六月十六日到二十日，朝、中人民部队又歼敌七千五百一十三名，其中毙伤李伪军五千二百八十五名，美军一千九百二十名；俘获美军、李伪军三百零八名，其中有美空军上尉驾驶员一名。
    朝、中人民部队在开城以南地区的反击中，一举将窜至该地区的李伪军青年团第一师一、二两大队和通津警察队的两股敌人大部歼灭，除毙伤百余名外，共俘获中队长、分队长、通讯排长以下官兵二百九十六名。在阻击战斗中，继续出现以少胜多的范例：某部在守卫杆城乾凤寺以西某某高地的战斗中，英勇地击退了李伪军优势兵力的三次进攻，以伤亡十三人的代价，毙伤敌军四百三十九名。守卫金化以北某某阵地的小部队，沉着地迎击敌军一个连的进攻。勇士们以突然的短兵火力击退敌军两次猛攻，杀伤敌三十余名，而我仅伤亡二人，确保了阵地。
    这五天中，对空射击创造了更辉煌的战果：计击落敌机二十八架，击伤敌机二十架，共达四十八架。某部射击手王永江以缴自美军的自动步枪发射三颗子弹即击落美喷气式战斗机一架。五天中我共毁伤敌军坦克十二辆。火箭筒射手朱有汉以美制火箭筒击毁美军坦克三辆。
