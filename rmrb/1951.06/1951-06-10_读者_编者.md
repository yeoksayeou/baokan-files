    Reactions to the Criticism in Issue No. 19 of This Publication

    After Issue No. 19 of this publication pointed out the serious proofreading errors in the "Regulations on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China" published in the third issue of the second volume of "Suburban Jiangsu Political Report," the General Office of the Suburban Jiangsu Administrative Office conducted a review: "This is because we still lack a serious and responsible spirit for publishing political reports and should arouse our serious vigilance in future work." The letter explained that the error was made because two documents published in the Suburban Jiangsu Daily on February 23 were used as the basis for editing and printing. The Suburban Jiangsu Daily had re-published the two documents on May 17. (The Suburban Jiangsu Daily made partial corrections to the proofreading errors in its February 25 issue, and the Suburban Jiangsu Political Report in the fourth issue of its second volume.)

    A reader from Shijiazhuang Railway Intermediate Technical School and Li Baozhong from West Fuxin Railway School wrote, requesting an in-depth discussion and criticism of the errors in "Railway Operation Studies." We believe that it is not necessary in this publication. Those who have read this book in some schools can conduct discussions.

    Qinfen Bookstore has sent a letter of self-criticism for passing off old books as new books, admitting this error and stating that it will actively improve its work in the future.

    The article "Some Technical Defects Existing in Several Periodicals" in the same issue pointed out that "Statistical Work" did not have a copyright page. The Publishing Department of the Statistics Bureau of the Northeast Planning Commission wrote to explain: Before the second issue of the second volume of the publication, because it was an internal publication, there was no copyright page; since the third issue of the second volume (published on January 31 of this year) was publicly published, each issue has a copyright page, and from the most recent issue, the copyright page will be fixed on the inside of the back cover, adding the number of printed copies.

            Regarding "Teaching Methods for Various Subjects in Elementary Schools"

    After Issue No. 19 of this publication published Comrade Xiong Di's criticism of the Beixin Bookstore's October 1950 reprint of "Teaching Methods for Various Subjects in Elementary Schools," Beixin Bookstore wrote to explain: "This book was originally a series of small booklets on teaching individual subjects. After liberation...we neither asked the original author to make key revisions, nor did we deeply review the content. We rashly compiled the complete existing books into two volumes, made up the uneven parts, and sold them." Mr. Yu Ziyi, who was called the "editor-in-chief" of the book, also wrote to us from Hangzhou, telling us about the process of entrusting Beixin Bookstore to print ten small booklets before liberation. After liberation, the existing books, contracts, and printing plates were taken over by the Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. In early 1950, Beixin Bookstore arbitrarily reprinted these ten small booklets and bound them into two volumes of "Teaching Methods for Various Subjects in Elementary Schools," marked as "New First Edition, February 1950." After discovering this, they lodged a protest with Beixin, and Li Xiaofeng, the person in charge of Beixin, replied that it was a compilation of old prints and would be sold until finished, and would not be reprinted. Mr. Yu Ziyi solemnly stated: "The October 1950 reprint of this book was unknown to both the Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and myself. Re-printing it without our knowledge and without prior revision is Beixin's dishonesty and irresponsibility to the readers."

    Beixin Bookstore made a mistake in handling this matter, and the explanation was also dishonest. Beixin Bookstore's letter did not separately explain the so-called "New First Edition, February 1950" and "Reprint, October 1950," obviously still trying to cover up its mistake. We believe this is wrong.

    Mr. Yu also made a self-criticism:

    "The two articles in the book, "How to Teach Reading" and "Practical Problems in Common Sense Teaching," were written by me. In the past, I did not clearly understand the reactionary essence of "Civics," and I still had many hopes for "Civics," thinking that through this kind of education, people could be improved, and thus society could be improved. This major erroneous idea is worth re-examining and reviewing. Because even if I have been working hard to transform myself recently, I should always be vigilant against the remnants of old ideas. The same is true of the incorrect view of child-centeredness.

    "The other articles were written by others. Although I am not the editor-in-chief, I should not have been so careless. If I had carefully proofread that passage on page 26 of "How to Teach Literacy" at that time, I would not have left it there. Although the critic does not investigate the ideology, after reading it, I carefully reflected on my ideological situation at that time. It was a serious oversight not to pay attention to that political remark at that time.

    "In addition to what the critic said, the materials on which these booklets are based, such as curricula and textbooks, are not in line with the new education. The theoretical basis of educational viewpoints and teaching methods are also not in line with the new education policy. On the surface, or when viewed in isolation, they may seem like just technical problems, but in the entire system, there are major problems everywhere.

    "I strongly support the idea that reprinting old books should be done with caution. Because everything has its historicity, so when a book or article is reprinted, it must be carefully proofread and necessary revisions must be made. Only in this way can it be considered responsible to the readers; publishers should be responsible in this way, and authors should be even more responsible."

            Regarding the Jianye Bookstore edition of "How to Use Punctuation Marks" by Zheng Youhui

    We have successively received letters from readers Yu Diyan and Qi Yu, pointing out that the book "How to Use Punctuation Marks" by Zheng Youhui, published by Beijing Jianye Bookstore in March 1951, largely plagiarized "How to Use Punctuation Marks" by Xi Jin (Donghua Edition, Guanghua Bookstore, October 1948). After we forwarded it to Mr. Zheng Youhui for reply, he wrote back admitting that he had committed the error of "disregarding publishing work and taking the credit of others as his own." The letter also stated that "the first edition of the book was printed in 5,000 copies, most of which were handed over to Xinhua Distribution. We have now agreed with Jianye Bookstore to stop reprinting." We hope readers will pay attention when buying books, and we also hope that authors must take a serious attitude and completely eliminate this shameful phenomenon of repeated plagiarism.

            "Lectures on the Constitution of the New Democratic Youth League" is Under Revision

    The "Publishing Trends" column in Issue No. 21 of this publication introduced a batch of publications on the Youth League that were widely sold, including "Lectures on the Constitution of the New Democratic Youth League." According to a letter from China Youth Publishing House: "This book was written in the early days of the Youth League's founding, and there are still many shortcomings in content and text. Therefore, we are revising it." Please note this point, young comrades who have purchased this book as study material.

            To Readers with Unknown Addresses

    To Feng Shu of Shijiazhuang, Huang Peng of Zhenjiang, Liu Yimin, a parent of elementary school students, a reader of Peking University, a reader of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce, Chen Heng, Lan Tian, Yang Zhonghua, Liu Zhuoru, and Li Chao: We have received your letters, and the questions you raised have been initially dealt with. We are preparing to reply to you, please inform us of your detailed addresses.

    We take this opportunity to ask readers: Please write your detailed address clearly in your letter so that we can contact you.

　　读者·编者
            对本刊第十九号批评的反应
    本刊第十九号指出“苏北政报”二卷三期刊载《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》所犯的严重的校勘错误后，苏北行署办公厅作了检讨：“这是由于我们对出版政报还缺乏严肃认真负责的精神，应引起我们今后工作上的严重警惕。”来信说明这一错误的造成是因为采用了二月二十三日苏北日报刊载的两个文件作为底稿编辑付印的，苏联日报已在五月十七日把两个文件重行刊登了一次。（苏北日报在二月二十五日的报上，苏北政报在二卷四期该刊上，对校勘的错误，都已作了局部更正。）
    石家庄铁道中级技术学校一读者和西阜新铁路学校李保忠君来信，要求对《铁路行车学》的错误进行深入的讨论与批评，我们以为在本刊上没有必要。某些学校中读过这本书的人，可以进行讨论。
    勤奋书局把旧书冒充新书，已来信作了检讨，承认这种错误，并表示今后当积极改进它的工作。
    同期《若干期刊中存在的一些技术性缺点》一文，曾指出《统计工作》没有版权页，东北计划委员会统计局出版部来信说明：该刊二卷二期以前，因系内部刊物，故无版权页；自二卷三期（本年一月三十一日出版）公开发刊以后，每期均印有版权页，并自最近一期起将版权页固定印在封底里，增列印刷册数。
            关于《小学各科教学方法》
    本刊第十九号发表了熊涤同志对北新书局一九五○年十月再版的《小学各科教学方法》的批评后，北新书局来信说明：“本书原是各科教学单行的小册子，解放以后……既未请原作者作重点修订，也未深入审阅内容，贸然将存书齐全的合订成二册，把参差的补印齐全，即行发售。”被称为该书“主编人”的俞子夷先生也自杭州写信给我们，告诉我们原书在解放前委托北新书局印成十种小册的经过；在解放后，存书、契约和纸型都由杭州市文教局接管。这十种小册子在一九五○年初，曾由北新书局擅行翻印，合装为《小学各科教学方法》上、下两册，标明“一九五○年二月新一版”；发现后曾向北新提出交涉，北新负责人李小峰答复说是旧印本合装，售完为止，不再重印。俞子夷先生郑重说明：该书“一九五○年十月再版，杭州市文教局和我都不知道。瞒着我们再版，不事先修订，是北新的不老实，对读者太不负责。”
    北新书局在这一件事情的处理上是犯了错误的，而且所作说明也是不老实的。北新书局来信并没有把所谓“一九五○年二月新一版”和“一九五○年十月再版）两件事分别加以说明，显然还是在掩饰它的错误。我们认为这是不应该的。
    愈先生也作了自我检讨：
    “书中《怎样教学读书》和《常识教学实际问题》两篇是我写的。对于《公民科》的反动本质，过去我确实认识不清，而且对《公民科》还存着不少的希望，以为通过这种教育，可以改进人，因而可以改进社会。这一重大的错误思想，是很值得重新提出来反省和检讨的。因为即使近来努力改造自己，对旧思想的残余，还应当时时提高警惕。关于儿童本位的不正确观点，也是这样。
    “其他各篇是别人写的。我虽不是总编辑，但我不应当如此马虎。《怎样教学识字》第二六页那段话，当时倘能仔细校读，决不会让它留着的。批评者虽不根究思想，但我读了以后却把那时期我的思想情况，仔细反省了一番，当时没有注意到那句政治性的话，实在是严重的疏忽。
    “除批评者所说，这些小册中所根据的，引用的资料如课程课本等都与新教育不合外，关于教育观点、教学方法的理论根据，也都和新教育方针不合。表面上看，或者局部地孤立了看，虽像只是技术问题，但就整个体系说，处处都有重大问题。
    “我极端拥护旧书新版要慎重。因为什么事都有它的历史性，所以一本书、一篇文在重印时，必须审慎地校读，而且要加以必要的修订。只有这样，才能算是对读者负责；出版人应当这样负责，著作人更应当这样负责。”
            关于建业书局版、郑友虺著：《标点符号使用法》
    我们先后接到读者余迪延、齐语二君来信指出北京建业书局一九五一年三月初版、郑友虺著《标点符号使用法》一书，极大部分抄袭了锡金著《标点符号怎样使用》（一九四八年十月光华书店东华版）。经我们转给郑友虺先生答复，他来信承认犯了“轻视出版工作，掠人之美据为己有》的错误。来信并说明“该书初版印刷五千册，大部分交新华发行，现已商得建业书局同意，停止再印。”希望读者在购书时注意，同时也希望著作人必须采取严肃的态度，彻底消灭这种辗转抄袭的可耻现象。
            《新民主主义青年团团章讲话》在修改中
    本刊二十一号的《出版动态》栏，曾介绍了一批销行很广的青年团问题的出版物，其中有《新民主主义青年团团章讲话》一种。现据中国青年社来函说：“该书是在青年团初期建团时写的，内容及文字上缺点尚多，因此，我们正在进行修改。”请已购买该书为学习材料的青年同志们注意这一点。
            致地址不明的读者
    石家庄冯澍、镇江黄彭、小学生家长刘一民、北大一读者、北京市人民政府工商局读者、陈恒、蓝天、杨中华、刘拙如、黎朝诸君：你们给我们的信都收到了，所提问题也都经过了初步处理，准备回信给你们，请告知详细地址。
    我们趁便向读者们要求：来信务请把详细地址写明，以便联系。
