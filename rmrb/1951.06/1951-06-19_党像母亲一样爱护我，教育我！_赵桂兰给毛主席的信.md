　　The Party Cares for Me and Educates Me Like a Mother!
    —Zhao Guilan's Letter to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao:

    The Party's 30th anniversary "July 1st" is coming soon! For thirty years, thanks to the arduous struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and you leading the people of the whole country, the two mountains weighing down on the Chinese people—the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the imperialist forces of aggression in our country—have been overthrown, and the People's Republic of China, led by the working class, has been established, so the Chinese people have truly stood up. I, an ordinary female worker, like the people of the whole country, have improved my social and political status, my life has improved, and I have also had the opportunity to study. Today, I would like to report to you on my learning situation at the Lushun-Dalian Party School over the past year and my future attitude.

    Chairman Mao, first let me thank you and the Party. Because I was injured at work and became disabled, the Party, like a mother caring for her child, quickly healed my injuries, and from June of last year, sent me to study in the cultural class of the Lushun-Dalian Party School. During this year, thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, especially seeing you twice, I gained new strength. Whenever I think of you, I forget the difficulties of learning without a hand. This year, I also participated in many meetings and gained a lot of knowledge. In April of this year, I was elected by the comrades of the Party School as a representative to the first session of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal People's Congress, and at this meeting, I was also elected as a member of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal Consultative Committee. I have learned a lot in politics and have a preliminary understanding of the nature of our country and the Party's main policies. My cultural level has also improved a lot. Now, writing general letters and reading simple articles is no longer difficult! My right hand has also become more useful. However, I still have shortcomings, and I am not good enough at helping and uniting with comrades. Under the education of the Party, I have the confidence to overcome it.

    Now, the people of the whole country are involved in the vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and all parts of the country are also enthusiastically launching movements to increase production and make donations, purchasing airplanes and cannons for our dearest people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—so that they can eliminate the enemy earlier and faster and defend the motherland. Our people in Lushun-Dalian are also enthusiastically responding to the call of the Lushun-Dalian Branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Association, preparing to increase production and donate "Lushun-Dalian air squadrons." I cannot produce, and the Party's task for me is to study, so I must work harder in my studies, do well in my studies, and prepare greater strength for defending and building the motherland. I plan to do the following in the second half of the year:

    In addition to completing the tasks prescribed by the school on time, I will plan to add some extracurricular reading, insist on writing diaries, practice writing short articles, strengthen the study of current affairs, squeeze out time to read newspapers every day, proactively and humbly study and unite with comrades, and in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and all other work, I will play the exemplary role of a Communist Party member, and publicize the policies of the Party and the government to my family, neighbors, and the masses at any time and in any place. Although the Lushun-Dalian area has arrested and dealt with a batch of counter-revolutionaries, the remaining enemies will never be reconciled to their failure and will still look for opportunities to carry out sabotage. Therefore, we must continue to raise our vigilance, prevent the sabotage of special agents, and ensure the smooth completion of the country's economic construction and national defense construction!

    I wish Chairman Mao good health forever!

                                      Zhao Guilan, June 18th

### 党像母亲一样爱护我，教育我！——赵桂兰给毛主席的信

　　党像母亲一样爱护我，教育我！
    ——赵桂兰给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    党的三十周年生日“七一”快来了！三十年来，由于中国共产党和您领导全国人民艰苦奋斗，推翻了压在中国人民头上的两座大山——国民党反动统治和帝国主义在我国的侵略势力，建立了以工人阶级为领导的中华人民共和国，中国人民才真正地站立了起来。我，一个普通女工，也和全国人民一样，提高了社会政治地位，生活得到了改善，并且还得到学习的机会。今天，我想向您报告一下我在旅大党校一年来的学习情形和今后的态度。
    毛主席，首先让我向您和党致谢。因为我在工作中负了伤，成了残废，党像母亲爱护自己的孩子一样，很快地给我治好了伤，从去年六月，又把我送到旅大党校文化班学习。在这一年当中，由于党的培养和教育，特别是看过您二次，使我增加了新的力量。每当想起了您，我就忘了没有手学习的困难。这一年，我还参加了不少的会议，得到了很多的知识。今年四月，我被党校的同志们选为旅大市第一届人民代表会议的代表，在这个会议上，我又被选为旅大市协商委员会的委员。我在政治上学到了不少的东西，初步懂得了我们国家的性质和党的主要政策。文化上也提高了不少，现在写一般的信和看简单的小文章，已再不是困难的事了！我的右手也锻炼得好用些了。但是，我还有缺点，帮助同志和团结同志还很不够。在党的教育下，我有信心来克服它。
    现在，全国人民都卷入了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，全国各地也都热烈地展开了增产捐献运动，购买飞机大炮给我们最亲爱的人——中国人民志愿军，好更早更快地歼灭敌人，保卫祖国。我们旅大人民也正在热烈地响应旅大市抗美援朝分会的号召，准备增产捐献“旅大机队”。我不能生产了，党给我的任务是学习，所以我要在学习上多加一把劲，把学习搞好，为保卫祖国，建设祖国，准备更大的力量。下半年我准备这样做：
    学习上除按时完成学校规定的任务外，要有计划地增加一些课外阅读，坚持写日记，练习写小文章，加强时事学习，每天挤出时间读报，主动地、虚心地学习和团结同志，在抗美援朝，镇压反革命运动及一切工作中，要起共产党员的模范作用，随时随地对家庭、邻居、群众进行党和政府的政策的宣传。虽然旅大地区已抓了和办了一批反革命分子，但是残余的敌人绝不甘心他的失败，还会瞅空进行破坏的。所以我们还要继续提高警惕性，防止特务分子的破坏，保证国家经济建设、国防建设的顺利完成！祝毛主席身体永远健康！
                                      赵桂兰  六月十八日
