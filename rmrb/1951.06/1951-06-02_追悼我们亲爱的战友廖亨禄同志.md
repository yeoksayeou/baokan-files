　　In Memory of Our Dear Comrade Liao Henglu
    Wu Ming
    Dearest Comrade Liao Henglu, on May 14th we received the heartbreaking news of your glorious sacrifice in Korea. Your sacrifice has only deepened our hatred for American imperialism.

    On the afternoon of May 19th, dozens of your former comrades who worked with you in Beijing, as well as those who received your guidance and worked under your leadership, gathered together in front of your portrait, reminiscing about your revolutionary achievements during your life.

    You were very young, only thirty-nine years old. But you had already been tempered into an outstanding cadre of our Party and our army. Your loyalty to the revolution was boundless, unwavering for twenty-three years. In 1929, you were a poor child who actively participated in revolutionary activities and joined the Communist Youth League. In 1930, you joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In 1931, you gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. For more than twenty years, you progressed from a soldier, propagandist, company political commissar, section chief, security minister, regimental political commissar, brigade political commissar, to the cadre management minister of the Pingyuan Provincial Military Region. You participated in the entire process of the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War; and finally, you went to the front line of resisting America and aiding Korea with the hearts of millions of people in the motherland.

    You were wholeheartedly devoted to the cause of the Party and the people, always persevering. For the sake of revolutionary interests, you never cared about personal gains or losses. Despite suffering from stomach ulcers and bronchitis, you persisted in working and helping comrades to progress. We clearly remember that during the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1943, you served as the political commissar of a regiment, leading your troops to establish an anti-Japanese base area in the Junan area of Huxi District (south of Juye, now Pingyuan Province). At that time, the "Five Ghosts" (Japanese invaders, puppet troops, rebel troops, Chiang's troops, and reactionary secret societies) were creating havoc in Huxi, and the environment was extremely harsh. You were so sick that you couldn't walk and had to be carried on a stretcher. Whenever we arrived at a place, you would lie on the stretcher, open a map, and direct our operations. Under your leadership, our regiment's combat effectiveness continuously improved, and it became a well-known, disciplined unit. Your face was frighteningly gaunt, but your eyes were so bright, and your mind was so clear. As soon as your illness improved slightly, you would go deep into the companies to talk to the soldiers and correct the typos in their study notebooks. During the southward march, you personally went to the classes to urge the soldiers to wash their feet and plan to improve their meals together.

    You had the best connection with the masses, you were humble and patient, and you were very good at promoting democracy. When you were alive, comrades often said, "You know our hearts, you even know our pulse." No matter how big or small the meeting was, you always listened to the speeches of the masses. Around you, whether intellectuals, workers, or peasants, everyone was willing to tell you all their problems. Everyone often said: If you have something, consult with Political Commissar Liao and there will be a solution! Comrade Li Huaguang remembered this strength of yours and shed tears. In the winter of 1945, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops nibbled and divided our liberated areas. Comrade Huaguang was ordered to take a small unit to attack outside the old course of the Yellow River and persist in the struggle in the marginal areas. The enemy was very arrogant, and we sometimes had to fight several battles a day, often suffering enemy attacks, and the struggle was extremely difficult. At that time, you rushed from a hundred miles away, quickly understood everyone's ideological situation, solved everyone's specific problems, and finally pointed out: "First of all, we must reverse the right-leaning emotions in the minds of cadres." After you left, the cadres made a deep self-criticism, the morale of the troops was reversed, and the task was successfully completed.

    You were good at squeezing time to study in the midst of your busy schedule. Over the years, you accumulated thick notebooks filled with study notes. When we studied the history of social development, you personally led the effort, and you specifically managed a group; your group was the model study group of our branch. You participated in every study test and asked everyone to grade your test papers.

    You were not only an excellent political cadre, but also a brave and outstanding military commander. In 1944, we marched to the Junan area, walked all night, and just arrived near Wangda Village when we discovered the enemy ahead. You immediately went to the place where the shooting was taking place to clarify the situation and led a small number of troops to cover the retreat of the directly subordinate units. In 1948, more than 30,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops "mopped up" our Huxi area, and you led hundreds of people to persist in the struggle in the hinterland. One day, you seized the opportunity and launched a "dig-out-the-heart" battle against the enemy. In this battle, our hundreds of people made tens of thousands of enemies panic. The next day, you safely withdrew the troops to the periphery.

    Dear Comrade Liao Henglu! How can we finish talking about your glorious deeds; what we remember are just a few fragments of your life's revolutionary struggle. Under the cultivation of the Party, coupled with your personal efforts, you have made many contributions to the people, and your blood and sweat have been shed over most of China; for the peace and happiness of the Chinese and Korean people, you have contributed your precious life. The Chinese and Korean people will always remember you, especially the people of the former Ji-Lu-Yu District (the area around present-day Pingyuan Province) will not forget you.

    Today, in front of your portrait, which is as strong as steel, we should not shed tears, we must turn grief into strength! We swear: "Learn from your good example, complete your unfinished business, and demand repayment of the blood debt from American imperialism!" We think this is your hope, and it is also the greatest comfort to you. Rest in peace! Dear comrade-in-arms! Your blood will bloom into bright red flowers in Korea and our motherland.

### 追悼我们亲爱的战友廖亨禄同志

　　追悼我们亲爱的战友廖亨禄同志
    吴明
    敬爱的廖亨禄同志，五月十四日我们得到你在朝鲜光荣牺牲的噩耗，实在忍不住心中的悲痛。你的牺牲，使我们更增加了对美帝国主义的仇恨。
    五月十九日下午，我们数十个在北京工作的你生前的战友，以及聆受过你的教诲和在你领导下工作过的同志，大家聚在一起，面对着你的遗像，追念你生前的革命业绩。
    你还非常年青，才三十九岁。但你已锻炼成我党我军的优秀干部。你对革命无限忠诚，二十三年如一日。一九二九年，那时你是一个贫苦的孩子，积极参加了革命活动，并且加入了共产主义青年团；一九三○年，你参加了中国工农红军；一九三一年你光荣地参加了中国共产党。二十多年来，你由一个战士、宣传员、连政委、科长、保卫部长、团政委、旅政委，直到平原省军区干部管理部长。你参加了土地革命、抗日战争、解放战争的全部过程；最后又带着祖国千万人民的心走上了抗美援朝的前线。
    你对党对人民事业，忠心耿耿，始终不懈。你为了革命利益，从不计较个人的得失。你虽然害着胃溃疡和气管炎，但仍坚持工作，并帮助同志进步。我们清楚地记得，在抗日战争最艰苦的一九四三年，你担任团政委工作，率部在湖西区巨南（现平原省巨野以南）一带建立抗日根据地。那时正是“五鬼”（日寇、伪军、叛军、蒋军、反动会道门）闹湖西，环境相当艰苦。你病得实在不能走路，用担架抬着你。每到一地，你躺在担架上打开地图指挥我们作战。在你的领导下，我们的团战斗力不断提高，并且成为有名的纪律良好的部队。你的脸消瘦得怕人，但你的眸子是那样的炯亮，头脑又是那样的清醒。病稍好一点，你便深入到连队中去，和战士们谈话，改正战士学习本子上的错字。南下时，你亲自到班里督促战士洗脚，和大家一块儿计划改善伙食。
    你联系群众最好，你谦虚耐心，你能很好地发扬民主。你在世的时候，同志们常说：“你知道我们的心，甚至知道我们的脉搏。”不管大小会议你总能听取群众的发言。在你的周围，不管知识分子、工农分子都愿意向你谈出他的一切问题。大家常说：有事情找廖政委商讨一下就有办法了！李华光同志想起了你这个长处，他落下了眼泪。一九四五年冬，蒋匪军对我解放区蚕食分割。华光同志奉命带小部队在黄河故道外线出击，坚持边缘区斗争。敌人非常嚣张，我们有时一天要打几次仗，时常遭受敌人的袭击，斗争相当艰苦。那时你从百里以外赶去，很快地了解了大家的思想情况，解决了大家的具体问题，最后指出：“首先要从干部思想上扭转右倾情绪。”你走后，干部作了深刻的检讨，部队情绪扭转过来，胜利地完成了任务。
    你善于在百忙中挤时间学习。你积年累月地存下一厚本一厚本的学习笔记。我们学社会发展史时，你亲自领导，你又具体地掌握一个小组；你那个小组是我们支部的模范学习小组。每次学习测验你都参加，并要求大家评改你的试卷。
    你不仅是一个优秀的政治干部，你还是一个勇敢卓越的军事指挥员。一九四四年，我们行军到巨南地区，走了一夜，刚到王大村附近，发现前面有敌人。你马上到打枪的地方弄清了情况，又带了很少的部队掩护着直属队撤退。一九四八年，蒋匪军三万多人“扫荡”我湖西区，你带几百人坚持腹地斗争。一天，你看准了火候，一下插入，向敌人来了个“挖心战”。这一仗我们几百人打得几万敌人惶惶不安。第二天你把部队又安全地撤到外围。
    亲爱的廖亨禄同志！你的光辉事绩，我们怎么能说得完；我们所记起的只不过是你一生革命斗争中几个片断。在党的培养下，加上你个人的努力，你对人民立下了不少的功勋，大半个中国洒下了你的血汗；为了中朝人民的和平与幸福，你又贡献了你宝贵的生命。中、朝人民永远纪念你，特别是原冀鲁豫区（现在的平原省一带）的人民更不会忘掉你。
    今天，在像钢铁一样坚强的你的遗像面前，我们不该流下眼泪，我们要化悲痛为力量！我们宣誓：“学习你的好榜样，完成你的未竟事业，向美帝国主义讨还血债！”我们想这是你的希望，也是对你最大的安慰。安眠吧！敬爱的战友！你的鲜血在朝鲜和我们的祖国都会开起灿烂的红花。
