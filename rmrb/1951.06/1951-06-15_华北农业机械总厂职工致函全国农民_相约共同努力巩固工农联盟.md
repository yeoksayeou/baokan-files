　　Letter from Workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to Farmers Nationwide
　　Agreeing to Work Together to Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance
　　Editor's Note: The entire staff of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory wrote a letter to the peasant brothers across the country, calling on them to actively implement the instructions issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government regarding the purchase and storage of cotton, sell their stored cotton to the state or store it with the state, to supply factory production and the needs of the military and civilians nationwide. The entire staff of the Agricultural Machinery General Factory also proposed to manufacture inexpensive and high-quality farm tools for the use of peasant brothers. This well demonstrates the leading role of the working class. Farmers should respond to their call and work together to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

　　To our peasant brothers across the country:
　　The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have recently issued instructions on the purchase and storage of cotton, calling on cotton farmers nationwide to launch a patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign. We hope that you will warmly respond to this call and immediately sell your stored cotton to the state or store it with the state. This will allow spinning mill workers to have work, the military and civilians nationwide to have clothes to wear, and prices to remain stable. Doing so will benefit the country and yourselves. This is also a concrete action to consolidate our worker-peasant alliance. If the peasant brothers do not help the state solve this difficulty and the production of spinning mills is indeed hindered, resulting in a shortage of yarn and cloth that affects the lives of the military and civilians nationwide and market prices, this will also be extremely unfavorable to the peasant brothers.
　　In the past, the staff of our factory has manufactured many new types of agricultural tools for the peasant brothers, enabling the peasant brothers to carry out production better. This year, we will work hard to manufacture more inexpensive and high-quality new types of agricultural tools for you, and strive to reduce the cost of our products by ten to fifteen percent. These have been listed as important conditions in our patriotic pledge. The agricultural machinery experts and engineers of our factory are working day and night to design better new types of agricultural tools for you. Our entire workforce is enthusiastically carrying out a patriotic labor competition. So far, we have reduced the cost of the new type of plow we produce by over ten percent. We are further learning the advanced production methods of our Soviet big brother and striving to reduce costs by fifteen percent.
　　We hope you will launch a patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign. Peasant brothers, let us join hands and work together to produce, cherish our motherland, and create a better life. We wish you a bumper harvest and good health!
　　The entire staff of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory

　　华北农业机械总厂职工致函全国农民        
    相约共同努力巩固工农联盟
    编者按：华北农业机械总厂全体职工写信给全国的农民弟兄，号召他们积极执行中央人民政府政务院发布的关于购棉储棉工作的指示，把自己的存棉售与国家或向国家储存，供应工厂生产和全国军民的需要。农业机械总厂全体职工并提出要制造价廉物美的农具，供农民弟兄使用。这事很好地表现了工人阶级的领导作用。农民们应响应他们的号召，同心协力，巩固工农联盟。
                                                          全国农民弟兄们：
    中央人民政府政务院和中国共产党中央最近分别发出了关于购棉储棉工作的指示，号召全国棉农展开爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。我们希望你们热烈响应这个号召，立即把存棉卖给国家，或向国家储存。这就可以使纱厂工人有工作，全国军民有衣穿，物价保持稳定。这样作了，对国家，对自己，都是有好处的。这也是巩固咱们工农联盟的一个具体行动。如果农民弟兄不帮助国家解决这个困难，真的使纱厂的生产发生困难，以致因为缺少纱布而影响到全国军民的生活及市场的物价，这对农民弟兄也是极为不利的。
    我们全厂的职工过去曾给农民弟兄制造了很多新式农具，使农民弟兄更好地进行生产。今年我们将努力给你们制造出更多价廉物美的新式农具；并争取把产品的成本减低百分之十到百分之十五。这些已经列为我们爱国公约的重要条件。我厂的农业机械专家和工程师们，都正在日夜钻研，要为你们设计出更好的新式农具。我们全体工人职员正在热烈开展爱国主义劳动竞赛。到目前为止，我们生产出的新式犁，成本已减低了百分之十强。我们正进一步学习苏联老大哥的先进生产方法，争取减低成本百分之十五。
    我们希望你们展开爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。农民弟兄们，让我们携起手来，共同努力生产，爱护祖国，创造更美满的生活。祝你们农业丰收，身体健康！
                                  华北农业机械总厂全体职工
