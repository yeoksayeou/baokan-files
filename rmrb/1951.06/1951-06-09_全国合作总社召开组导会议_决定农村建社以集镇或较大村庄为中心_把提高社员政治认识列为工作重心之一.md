The All-China Federation of Cooperatives convened a National Cooperative Organizational Guidance Work Conference in Beijing on May 22nd to discuss issues related to the organization of cooperatives. The conference concluded on June 2nd.

The conference reviewed the current organizational development of cooperatives and concluded that significant progress had been made in the development of cooperatives last year. In particular, due to the correct implementation of the policy of consolidating cooperatives in old liberated areas and steadily building cooperatives in new areas since the second half of last year, cooperative organizations in various regions have been greatly strengthened and have won the support of the broad masses of working people. In addition, the establishment of upper-level leading institutions of cooperatives in various regions has largely been completed, providing a good foundation for the great development of cooperatives in the future. However, based on several statistical materials, the average cooperative currently can only meet about 10% to 20% of the needs of its members. The reasons for not fully meeting the needs of members, in addition to cooperative cadres not yet being familiar with new management methods, are mainly due to the existence of unreasonable phenomena in the organizational form and internal structure of cooperatives. Most upper-level cooperative organizations have not yet established separate business institutions and business guidance institutions; at the grassroots level, many cooperatives were established according to administrative regions or administrative and production units in the past, so many cooperatives have few members, little capital, or inconvenient locations, making it difficult for members to purchase and sell goods. Therefore, the conference decided that the establishment of rural cooperatives should be centered on market towns or larger villages in the future; cooperatives already established according to administrative villages should be merged after obtaining the consent of the members to concentrate resources and expand operations. In cities, consumer cooperatives should be established in the following three ways in the future:

	I. Larger factories, schools, and institutions with centralized dormitories can still establish cooperatives according to production units or administrative units.

	II. Organize workers' consumer cooperatives in areas where workers live in concentrated areas; all factory and institution employees living in this area can participate.

	III. In places where workers do not live in concentrated areas, mixed consumer cooperatives can be organized by district, and their members can include employees, other working people, and students.

Regarding the internal structure of cooperatives at all levels, the conference decided that, in order to expand operations, it is necessary to establish separate business guidance institutions and business operation institutions: 1. The federations of large administrative regions, provinces, and counties should quickly establish two business administrative departments, supply and marketing, directly under the leadership of the board of directors, in order to better guide and organize the supply and marketing business of lower-level cooperatives. 2. Federations at all levels should separate the business guidance institutions and operating institutions of supply and marketing to avoid the phenomenon of focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other, such as more supply than sales or more sales than supply. 3. Federations at all levels above the county level should, according to the economic situation and business needs of the region, establish business institutions such as warehouses, storage yards, transportation stations, and processing factories at appropriate locations in a planned manner.

The conference discussed the types of cooperatives that should be organized currently. The conference decided that, according to the needs of the current economic situation, in addition to urban consumer cooperatives and rural supply and marketing cooperatives, it is also necessary to vigorously organize handicraft production cooperatives, fishery cooperatives, and transportation cooperatives. The conference believes that credit business is related to the country's financial policy, and it is not easy for cooperatives to do well, and it is recommended that the People's Bank of China do it. As for agricultural production cooperatives, the conditions for their establishment are not yet in place.

The conference also discussed the current work focus of the organizational guidance departments. The conference decided that the organizational guidance departments should focus on the following tasks: 1. There are still some cooperatives that have not been rectified, and rectification work should continue. 2. Since last autumn and this spring, land reform has been completed in new areas with a population of more than 130 million. This winter and next spring, land reform will be completed throughout the country except for ethnic minority areas. In order to meet the demands of the vast number of liberated peasants, we should prepare to vigorously develop cooperative construction. However, according to the current cadre conditions and the needs of national economic construction, we should focus on building cooperatives in areas that grow cash crops such as cotton, hemp, tobacco, and tea. 3. Strengthen political work. At present, cooperatives have formed a national mass economic organization, but its political influence is not yet widespread enough. Therefore, cooperatives must actively participate in social activities and use every opportunity to publicize the work of cooperatives and their benefits to the working people in order to obtain broader support from society; at the same time, make the broad masses of working people realize the benefits of organizing and cultivate their collective consciousness. Political education should be strengthened within the cooperatives to raise the political awareness of the members.

In addition, the conference also discussed the draft articles of association for urban consumer cooperatives, rural supply and marketing cooperatives, and federations at all levels, as well as the draft registration measures for supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives of the People's Republic of China. These articles of association and measures will be submitted to the Council of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for approval and implementation.

### 全国合作总社召开组导会议  决定农村建社以集镇或较大村庄为中心  把提高社员政治认识列为工作重心之一

　　全国合作总社召开组导会议
    决定农村建社以集镇或较大村庄为中心
    把提高社员政治认识列为工作重心之一
    全国合作社联合总社于五月二十二日在北京召开全国合作社组导工作会议，讨论合作社的组织工作问题。会议于六月二日闭幕。
    会议检查了目前合作社的组织发展情况，认为去年合作社的发展工作是有很大成绩的。特别是由于去年下半年以来老区整社工作和新区稳步建社工作方针的正确执行，各地合作社组织已大大巩固起来，并得到广大劳动人民的拥护。加以各地合作社的上级领导机构已大部建立，今后合作社的大发展已有了良好的基础。但从几个统计材料看来，目前一般合作社平均只能满足社员需要量的百分之十到百分之二十左右。不能充分满足社员需要的原因，除了合作社干部还不熟悉新的经营方法外，主要是合作社的组织形式和内部机构还存在着不合理的现象。上级合作社大多数还没有单独建立业务机构和业务指导机构；基层社又由于过去大半是按行政区或行政和生产单位建立的，所以不少合作社社员少，资金少，或者社址不适中，社员购销货物不方便。因此会议决定：在农村中建社，今后要以集镇或较大村庄为中心；已经按行政村建立的合作社，应在取得社员同意后合并，以便集中力量扩大经营。在城市中，今后应按以下三种方式建立消费合作社：
    一、较大的工厂、学校、机关，有集中的宿舍者，仍可以按生产单位或行政单位建社。
    二、在工人集中居住的地区组织工人消费合作社；凡是住在这个区域内的工厂、机关职工都可以参加。
    三、在没有工人集中居住的地方，可按区组织混合消费合作社，其社员可包括职工、其他劳动人民、学生。
    在各级合作社内部机构方面，会议决定，为了扩大经营，必须单独设立业务指导机构和业务经营机构：一、大行政区、省、县的联合社应迅速在理事会直接领导下设立供应与推销两个业务行政部门，以便更好地指导与组织下级社的供应、推销业务。二、各级联合社应把供应、推销的业务指导机构与经营机构分开，以避免供多于销或销多于供的顾此失彼现象。三、县以上的各级联合社，应根据本地区的经济情况及业务需要，有计划地在适当地点建立货栈、仓库、运输站、加工工厂等业务机构。
    会议讨论了目前应组织那几种合作社的问题。会议决定：根据目前经济形势的需要，除了城市消费合作社和农村供销合作社外，还需要大力组织手工业生产合作社、渔业合作社和运输合作社。会议认为：信贷业务有关国家的金融政策，合作社不易做好，建议由人民银行去做。至于农业生产合作社，目前还没有成立的条件。
    会议也讨论了组导部门目前的工作重心问题。会议决定组导部门目前应着重做以下几件工作：一、目前还有一部分合作社没有整顿，应继续展开整社工作。二、去秋到今春已有一亿三千多万人口的新区完成了土地改革，今冬明春除少数民族地区外，全国将完成土地改革。为了满足广大翻身农民的要求，应准备大力开展建社工作。但据目前的干部条件与国家经济建设的需要，应以种植棉、麻、烟、茶等经济作物地区为重点建社地区。三、要加强政治工作。目前合作社已形成全国性的群众经济组织，但它所起的政治影响还不够广泛。因此合作社必须积极参加社会活动，利用一切机会宣传合作社的工作和它对劳动人民的好处，以取得社会上更广泛的支持；同时，使广大的劳动人民认识到组织起来的好处，以培养他们的集体观念。在社内要加强政治教育，提高社员的政治认识。
    此外，会议还讨论了城市消费合作社、农村供销合作社和各级联合社的章程准则草案，中华人民共和国供销、消费合作社登记办法草案等文件。这些章程、办法，将提交全国合作社联合总社理事会批准后实行。
