　　Front and Rear Unite as One
　　--A Record of the Great Production Movement in Rural Northern Sichuan
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Yuan Yuming
　　Northern Sichuan, like other provinces and regions in our motherland, is very beautiful. The majestic and picturesque Daba Mountains stretch across the north, and the Fu River and Jialing River, along with smaller rivers, flow through the center. Scattered among the mountains and rivers are citrus orchards. Within these Daba Mountains, on the vast plains along the Fu River and Jialing River, and within these orchards, live fifteen million five hundred and fifty thousand people. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the laboring people, with poor peasants and farm laborers as the core, formed a mighty army against feudalism and launched a united assault on the landlord class. Land reform has now been completed in the suburbs of Nanchong City and in six counties: Nanchong, Suining, Nanbu, Langzhong, Santai, and Yuechi; as well as in four districts of Dazhou, Guangyuan, Bazhong, and Jiangyou counties, totaling 380 townships. In these areas, with a population of 4,610,000, poor peasants and farm laborers, who account for more than 50% of the rural population, have each received about one mu of land (producing approximately 400 jin of grain per mu), and each household has received 100,000 to 200,000 yuan in Renminbi. The production material difficulties of the emancipated peasants have been initially resolved. In early June, land reform began in fifteen more counties with a population of 7,620,000. In the remaining sixteen counties, with a population of over 3,200,000, the movements to reduce rent and return deposits, eliminate bandits, and oppose local bullies have concluded, and the masses have been initially mobilized. The emancipated peasants have obtained a large number of victorious fruits, and with the People's Government's loans of 4,600,000 jin of rice and 9 billion yuan, the difficulties in spring plowing and production have been appropriately resolved. Therefore, the peasants' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high. In addition, governments at all levels have paid close attention to leading agricultural production, and the great production movement in the countryside is flourishing vigorously. According to extremely incomplete statistics, over 24,000 new and repaired large and small ponds and weirs have been built, capable of irrigating over 500,346 mu of land; over 150,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed; over 50 million trees have been planted; and in the management of farmland, attention has begun to be paid to deep plowing and careful cultivation, with an increase in the amount of fertilizer applied compared to the past.
　　Why is the production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants so high? Because they have been given land. Because their sons and daughters are bravely fighting in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea. They love the land they have been given, they love their sons and daughters, but even more, they love their motherland. It is precisely because of this that they send their own children into the Volunteer Army, urging them to fight bravely to protect the land they have been given, to protect the parents and children of millions, and to protect their motherland. Therefore, every victory message, every story of a heroic enemy-killing act, and every letter from home coming from Korea inspires the production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants; and every victory message from the rear production front, every story of a labor model, and every reply letter inspires the courage of their sons and daughters to kill the enemy. The patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has forged an incomparably strong chain in the hearts of millions of people in the front and rear.
　　"Trees have tops and trees have roots, tree tops and roots are one. America is a big tree top, landlords are the fine roots. Children fight the treetop at the front, parents dig the roots at the rear. The front and rear work together to pull up the tree to be satisfied." This kind of loud labor song floats on the ridges of fields and the banks of small rivers everywhere, and a vigorous great production movement is unfolding everywhere. In order to overcome drought, peasants are working hard to repair weirs and build ponds. After the weirs and ponds are built, people erect a stone tablet by the side of the weirs and ponds, and inscribe on it large characters such as "Production Weir," "Liberation Weir," and "Emancipation Pond."
　　The emancipated peasants care about current affairs and political news as much as they care about their own land. The victories on the Korean front have given the people who are repairing the weirs and ponds infinite strength. When the peasants of Linglong Township in Yanting County were digging ponds, they sang to each other ditties and clappers that described the embarrassing appearance of the corrupt and incompetent American soldiers on the Korean front. One side sang: "America is a big bully, we are not afraid of it, Pigsy wants to eat ginseng fruit, we will knock out its pig teeth!" The other side sang: "America is a big bully, adults and children fight together, dig deep weirs and build deep water, and all the big and small bullies will be drowned." Due to the high enthusiasm for production, the peasants of the township quickly repaired 180 ponds and weirs, turning 1,280 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Then the peasants changed a folk song that used to describe the drought conditions in this area. In the past it was: "What a dry Chun ditch, no harvest for two years out of three, if there is a harvest, even dogs don't eat the thin gruel." Now it has been changed to "What a dry Chun ditch, there will be a bumper harvest every year, support the Volunteer Army, and beat the American soldiers to death and throw them in the gully."
　　Northern Sichuan is one of the cotton-producing areas in Sichuan, and Suining Prefecture is the center of the cotton-producing areas in Northern Sichuan. After the Northern Sichuan People's Administrative Office issued a large number of cotton planting calls, the counties responded one after another. The cotton fields in Suining Prefecture expanded to 900,000 mu. Nanchong Prefecture also exceeded the original task, planting a total of 400,000 mu of cotton. During the cotton planting competition in Huayan Township, Tongnan, the peasants said one after another: "Grow good cotton so that the Volunteer Army can wear warm clothes so that they can fight the American devils." The township automatically increased the cotton fields from 200 mu to more than 890 mu. After the cotton seedlings emerged, some areas experienced insect plagues, and the peasants immediately organized to catch them with all their strength. Farmers in the first village of Zhanshan Township, Xichong County, organized ten borer-catching teams and lit torches at night to catch the borers. The fire illuminated the fields. Everyone happily shouted, "Step up the moth-catching, protect production, resist America and aid Korea!" Farmer Zhang Jirong said: "The borer moth is like a counter-revolutionary, if we do not resolutely suppress it, it will destroy production."
　　The emancipated peasants all know where their happiness comes from. Therefore, the peasants are very enthusiastic about taking care of the families of martyrs and military personnel. Substitute farming teams are generally organized in rural areas, and the land cultivated by these teams is often done better than the peasants' own land. When the substitute farming team of Datong Village, Liping Township, Fifth District of Yanting, helped Mong Changquan, a member of the military, to produce, the men carried manure and the women carried firewood. The men said: "Female comrades, don't be lazy, carry the firewood fully." The women replied: "Male comrades, don't be cunning, don't edge along the road halfway." The family members of martyrs and military personnel were very happy and grateful to see the substitute farming team planting their fields well. The family members of the military personnel wrote letters to their children, asking them to kill more enemies and make more contributions on the front line. Liu Chen of Tongjiang said: "I gave birth to a son and a daughter. My daughter joined the Red Army in 1933 and now works in a factory in Chongqing. This year, my son heard that American planes were randomly dropping bombs in the Northeast, killing many people, so he joined the Volunteer Army. At first, I thought: if my son joins the army, there will be no one at home to do the work. Later, I didn't know when the substitute farming team planted all my three mu of land. I want to write to my children and ask them to fight and work hard, and don't worry about me, the old woman." Many family members of the Volunteer Army did not completely delegate their family life to the substitute farming team. They tried their best to regenerate themselves, and some even challenged their children who were killing the enemy on the front line to a competition, asking their sons to kill more American devils and become heroes in killing the enemy, and they would work harder at home to produce more grain to resist America and aid Korea and become labor models. Chen Zhuqing, a member of the Volunteer Army in Nanchong, wrote to his daughter Xiaoling: "Jiang Kaishek made our family so miserable! Now that you have arrived on the Korean front to fight Jiang Kaishek's boss, the American devils, I admire your backbone. Your mother has only one request for you, that is, be sure to defeat the American devils and defeat Jiang Kaishek, and vent my anger. You are my only daughter, and my hope is completely pinned on you. You should avenge your mother, and don't wrong my raising you. Now, when I walk on the street, others respect me very much. Your glory in Korea has also brought glory to your mother. I work harder at needlework at home, and don't bother others, and I will never live up to the title of a glorious military family member. I will definitely work hard in the rear to support Korea, and I hope you will be more brave and kill more enemies." Du Jichun (female), chairman of the Seventh Village Farmers Association in Junxing Township, Xichong County, was very happy to receive a letter of commendation from her son in Korea. She immediately convened a family meeting to mobilize all members of the family, young and old, to compete with the son who had made contributions on the front line. Du Jichun led and organized the masses in the village to sow more than 70 mu of land in one day, and also captured a special agent. She said: "In the past, the Kuomintang wanted to conscript my son, and for him, I don't know how much money I spent, and almost all the fields were pawned. I was hungry for several years. During the rent reduction and deposit return movement last autumn, I got a lot of fruits of victory. In a few days, there will be "land reform" to divide the fields, take charge of the seals, the family will become more and more complete, and the people's country will become more and more stable. I wrote a letter to my son to tell him to kill more enemies, protect your mother, protect everyone's mother, protect our and everyone's happy family, and defend the people's country."
　　Now, the spring ploughing and production movement in Northern Sichuan has ended and has turned to the stage of harvesting the small spring (i.e. summer harvest) and transplanting rice seedlings.

　　后方前方一条心
    ——记川北区农村的大生产运动
    本报特约记者　袁毓明
    川北区同祖国其他省区一样，是很美丽的。北面横亘着峰峦如画的大巴山，中间奔流着涪江和嘉陵江等大小河流。山水之间，柑橘果园星罗棋布。在这大巴山中，涪江、嘉陵江两岸广阔的原野上，和这些果林里，住着一千五百五十万人。劳动人民获得解放以后，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，以贫雇农为核心，组成了一支反封建的大军，一致向着地主阶级冲击。现在已有南充市郊及南充、遂宁、南部、阆中、三台、岳池六个县，达县、广元、巴中、江油县的四个区，共三百八十个乡完成了土地改革。在以上四百六十一万人口的地区中，占农村人口百分之五十以上的贫雇农，每人分得一亩左右土地（这些土地，每亩产量约四百斤粮食左右），每户分得人民币十万至二十万元。翻身农民的生产资料的困难已初步解决了。六月上旬，又有十五个县、七百六十二万人口的地区开始进行土地改革。其余待土地改革的十六个县、三百二十多万人口的地区，业已结束了减租退押清剿土匪反对恶霸运动，群众也已有了初步发动。翻身农民获得大批胜利果实，和人民政府四百六十余万斤大米的贷粮及九十余亿贷款，春耕生产中的困难已得到了适当的解决。因此，农民的生产情绪空前高涨。加以各级人民政府十分注意对于农业生产的领导，农村的大生产运动，遂蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。根据极不完全的统计，全区新筑和修复的大小塘堰达二万四千余口，可灌田五十万零三千四百六十余亩；垦荒十五万余亩；植树五千余万株；在田地的经营上，已开始注意深耕细作，施肥量较过去增多了。
    为什么广大农民的生产劲头这么大呢？因为他们分得了土地。因为在朝鲜英勇作战的中国人民志愿军中，有他们的儿女。他们热爱自己分得的土地，热爱自己的儿女，但更热爱自己的祖国。也正因为如此，所以他们才把自己亲生的儿女，送到志愿军中，叫他们努力杀敌，来保护自己分得的土地，保护成千成万人的父母子女，保护自己的祖国。因此，在朝鲜传来的每一个胜利消息每一个杀敌英雄的故事，每一封家信，都在鼓舞着广大农民的生产情绪；而后方生产战线上的每一个胜利消息，每一个劳动模范的故事，每一封回信，也在鼓舞着他们儿女的杀敌勇气。抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国主义运动，已在后方前方千万人民的心中，结成了一条坚强无比的锁链。
    “树有头来树有根，树头树根是一根。美国是个大树头，地主就是毛毛根。儿女前线打树头，父母后方挖树根。前方后方齐动手，把树拔掉才甘心。”各地的田坎上、小河边，飘荡着这种嘹亮的劳动歌声，到处开展着轰轰烈烈的大生产运动。为了战胜旱灾，农民努力修堰筑塘。堰塘修筑好之后，人们在堰塘边上树立一块石碑，刻上“生产堰”、“解放堰”、“翻身塘”等大字。
    翻身农民像关心自己的土地一样地关心时事、政治消息。朝鲜前线上的胜利，给修堰塘的人们增加了无限的力量。盐亭灵龙乡农民挖塘时，互相演唱描写朝鲜前线美国兵腐败无能的狼狈相的小曲和快板。这边唱：“美国是个大恶霸，我们不怕它，猪八戒想吃人参果哟，我们打掉它的猪牙！”那边唱：“美国是个大恶霸，大人娃娃一齐打，挖深塘堰筑深水，大小恶霸都淹垮。”由于生产热情的高涨，该乡农民迅速修好一百八十个塘堰，使一千二百八十亩旱地变成了水田。于是农民就把过去形容这一带旱沟情况的一首歌谣改变过来。过去是：“好个干春沟，三年两不收，如果收上了，狗都不吃稀溇溇。”现在改为“好个干春沟，年年将丰收，支援志愿军，打死美国兵丢山沟。”
    川北为四川产棉区之一，遂宁专区又为川北产棉区的中心。川北人民行政公署发出大量植棉的号召后，各县纷纷响应。遂宁专区棉田扩展到九十万亩。南充专区也都超过了原订任务，共植棉四十万亩。潼南花岩乡植棉竞赛时，农民纷纷说：“种好棉花，好让志愿军穿得暖暖的，才好打美国鬼子。”该乡自动把棉田二百亩，增加为八百九十余亩。棉苗出土后，有部分地区发生了虫灾，农民立即组织起来，全力扑捉。西充县占山乡第一村农民组织了十个扑螟小组，夜间点着火把扑螟。火光照红了田野。大家兴高采烈地喊着：“加紧扑螟蛾，保护生产，抗美援朝！”农民张继荣说：“螟蛾好比反革命，我们不坚决镇压，它就要破坏生产。”
    翻身农民都知道自己的幸福是从那里得来的。因此，农民们十分热心地照顾烈属和军属，农村中普遍地组织了代耕队，代耕的土地往往比农民自己的土地还做得好。盐亭五区里坪乡大同村代耕队帮助军属蒙昌全生产时，男的担粪，女的背柴。男的说：“女同志，莫偷懒，背柴要背满。”女的回答道：“男同志，莫躲奸，别在半路梭边边。”烈属、军属眼见到代耕队把自己的田种好了，心里十分欢喜和感激。军属纷纷给自己的子女写信，叫他们在前线多杀敌人，多立功。通江刘陈氏说：“我生了一儿一女，女在一九三三年参加了红军，现在重庆工厂工作。儿子今年听到美国的飞机在东北乱丢炸弹，炸死好多人，就参加了志愿军。起初，我还想：儿子参了军，家里没有人做活了。后来，不晓得代耕队什么时候把我的三亩地都种上了。我要写信给我儿女，喊他们好好打仗做工作，不用挂念我这老婆婆。”很多志愿军的家属并没有把自己家里的生活完全推托给代耕队作。他们尽量自力更生，有的还向自己在前线杀敌的儿女挑起竞赛，要儿子在前线多杀几个美国鬼子，当杀敌英雄，自己在家加劲生产，多打粮食来抗美援朝，当劳动模范。南充志愿军军属陈竹青给他的女儿小玲去信说：“蒋该死把我们家整得好惨呵！现在你到了朝鲜前线，去打蒋该死的老板美国鬼子，我佩服你有骨气。你妈妈对你只有一个要求，就是千万要把美国鬼子打倒，把蒋该死打倒，给我出口闷气。你是我仅有的一个女儿，我的希望完全寄托在你身上，你应该给妈妈报仇，不冤枉妈妈养活你一场。现在，我一走到街上，别人都很崇敬我。你在朝鲜的光荣，也给妈妈带来了光荣。我在家加紧做针线活路，不麻烦别人，绝不亏负这个光荣军属的称号。我一定在后方努力，支援朝鲜，也盼望着你更勇敢，多杀敌人。”西充县俊兴乡七村农协主席杜季春（女）接到她儿子从朝鲜寄来的报功信，高兴得不得了，立刻召开家庭会议，发动全家大大小小和前线立功的儿子比赛。杜季春领导与组织村里的群众，在一天之内播种了七十多亩地，自己还捉了一个特务分子。她说：“过去国民党要拉我的儿子当壮丁，为了他，我不知道花了多少钱，把田产也当得差不多了，挨饿了好几年，去年秋后减租退押运动时，我分到了很多胜利果实。再过几天，又要“土地改革”，分田地，掌印把子，家庭越来越美满，人民的江山越坐越稳，我写信告诉我的儿子说，你要多杀敌人，好好保护你的母亲，保护大家的母亲，保护我们和大家的美满家庭，保卫人民的江山。”
    现在，川北区的春耕生产运动已经结束，已转入到收割小春（即夏收）插秧阶段。
