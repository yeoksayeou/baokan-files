　　Launch a Patriotic Cotton Selling and Storing Campaign
            The Hebei Provincial People's Government issued a call to cotton farmers and cotton storage households
    [This dispatch from Baoding, June 1st, at 23:00] The Hebei Provincial People's Government today issued a call to cotton farmers and cotton storage households throughout the province regarding the launch of a patriotic cotton selling and storing campaign. The full text is as follows:
    On June 1st, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on cotton purchasing and storing work. We fully support them and are determined to implement them resolutely.
    The broad masses of farmers in our province have implemented land reform, overthrown the feudal rule in the countryside, and greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. In order to carry out the new democratic economic construction, last year and this year, the broad masses of farmers enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's and the Central People's Government's call to plant more cotton. Last year, cotton fields in our province achieved a widespread bumper harvest. During the autumn grain collection, cotton farmers enthusiastically paid taxes to the state with cotton and sold cotton to the state, supporting the textile industry's production, not only achieving prosperity through cotton planting but also playing a huge role in the country's economic construction. However, due to the increasing regional differences in cotton prices since the beginning of spring this year, as well as insufficient supply of the production and living materials needed by farmers, cotton farmers in various places have generally stored cotton without selling it, resulting in very little cotton being collected by the state, which has seriously affected the production of yarn factories and is extremely detrimental to the overall economic construction. If the broad masses of farmers understand this situation, it will certainly arouse high attention and concern. All farmers in the province should closely follow the example of our worker compatriots, contribute our strength, support economic construction, immediately sell cotton to the state, or deposit it in the People's Bank and cooperatives, to ensure the supply of raw cotton to yarn factories across the country, and to ensure the clothing needs of front-line soldiers and the broad masses of people. This is an important contribution to the country and a patriotic expression of the farmers of the whole province, and it is "taking into consideration both public and private interests," which is beneficial to the country and the people. The state can further take care of the interests of cotton farmers. Recently, cotton prices have been appropriately adjusted, and all reasonable and necessary measures beneficial to cotton farmers have been taken. Therefore, this government hereby issues the following call to cotton farmers and cotton storage households throughout the province:
    (1) Highly promote patriotic enthusiasm and respond to the call of the Central People's Government for selling and storing cotton with practical actions. Cotton storage households should quickly sell as much of their stored cotton as possible to the state at reasonable listed prices or deposit it in state-owned banks and cooperatives. The People's Bank and cooperatives not only guarantee the principal and maintain the value of the deposited cotton, with prices only rising and not falling. When the market price is high, it is calculated according to the market price, and interest is paid at 1.2% per month. Lump-sum deposits and withdrawals or partial withdrawals, taking money or goods, are all at the convenience of the depositors and can be used to offset public grain. Such flexibility and convenience do not cause any loss to cotton storage households. We sincerely hope that cotton compatriots in various places, in the anti-American aggression and aid Korea patriotic movement, will encourage each other and launch an enthusiastic cotton selling and storing campaign as one of our practical actions of patriotism.
    (2) All economic departments should actively allocate and supply materials according to the needs of the masses, with a plan to ensure an adequate supply of production and living materials for cotton farmers.
    (3) Cotton stored by all levels of cooperatives and all organs for production and financial purposes must be immediately sold to the state without exception, and private storage, management, or concealment is not allowed.
    Finally, we ask cadres of governments at all levels, people's organizations, and the broad masses of rural production models to actively strive to widely publicize the methods of selling and storing cotton to every household and mobilize all cotton farmers to quickly turn this call into a widespread and practical action throughout the province.
            The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government deployed cotton purchasing and storing work
    [This dispatch from Xinxiang, June 2nd, at 22:00] The Pingyuan Provincial People's Government today instructed governments at all levels to regard the cotton purchasing and storing work instructed by the State Council as one of the major tasks for the three months of June, July, and August. In response to the situation in various places where cotton farmers are storing cotton and waiting for new wheat to be marketed to purchase wheat and living materials, in addition to calling on cotton farmers to hand over cotton to offset public grain during the summer grain collection, the province's grain company is also required to allocate and sell wheat and other food grains to cotton-producing areas, and the province's cotton yarn cloth company, the province's trade company and other trade departments are required to vigorously organize supplies to cotton-producing areas. The instructions assigned the province's cotton yarn cloth company, cooperatives, and other agent stores entrusted by the cotton yarn cloth company as business organizations for purchasing cotton, handling cotton to offset public grain, and handling bank cotton deposit interest. The instructions required governments at all levels to strengthen market administrative leadership, concentrate cotton in exchanges for trading, strictly crack down on illegal commercial acts such as adulteration, making cotton damp, hoarding and pre-selling, and pushing up prices.
            The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Subei District Committee called for the implementation of cotton purchasing and storing instructions
    [This dispatch from Xinxiang, June 2nd, at 22:00] The Pingyuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today instructed Party committees at all levels to immediately mobilize all Party members, League members, Women's Federation members, and cooperative members in cotton-producing areas to promote the broad masses of cotton farmers to launch an anti-American aggression and aid Korea, defend the country and sell and store cotton movement through their own exemplary role.
    [This dispatch from Yangzhou, June 1st] Today, the Subei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision, calling on Party committees at all levels to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to ensure the successful completion of the cotton purchasing and storing task. The decision stated:
    In order to resolutely implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on ensuring the successful completion of the cotton purchasing and storing task, the District Committee hereby makes the following decisions: (1) Subei is one of the main cotton-producing areas in the country, and completing this task is extremely important. After seeing this instruction from the Central Committee, Party committees at all levels should immediately convey it and earnestly implement it. In particular, the Nantong and Yancheng local committees must discuss it in detail, make specific deployments, and directly send people to the cotton-producing areas to carry out this work, treating it as an extremely urgent and important task at present. (2) All branches and Party members in cotton-producing areas must immediately mobilize, respond to this call from the Central Committee, and resolutely promote the launch of the cotton selling and storing movement by all cotton farmers with their own practical actions. This work should be regarded as a concrete manifestation of one's own anti-American aggression and aid Korea patriotic action to ensure the successful completion of this task. (3) Party committees at all levels must resolutely implement the specific decisions on this work issued by the Subei People's Administrative Office.

　　展开爱国售棉储棉运动
            河北省人民政府向棉农和存棉户发出号召
    【本报保定一日二十三时专电】河北省人民政府于今日向全省棉农和存棉户发出了关于开展爱国售棉储棉运动的号召。全文如下：
    六月一日，中央人民政府政务院发出关于购棉储棉工作的指示，我们完全拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我省广大农民实行了土地改革，推翻了农村的封建统治，生产情绪大为提高。为进行新民主主义的经济建设，去年与今年，广大农民都热烈地响应了毛主席及中央人民政府多种棉花的号召。我省去年棉田曾得到普遍丰收。秋征时，棉农热烈地用棉花向国家交税，把棉花卖给国家，支持了纺织工业生产，不但达到种棉发家，而且对国家经济建设起了巨大作用。但由于今年入春以来棉价地区差额加大，同时对农民所需生产生活资料调供不足，各地棉农发生了普遍存棉不售的现象，国家收棉甚少，以致纱厂生产受到严重影响，对整个经济建设极为不利。广大农民同胞如果了解到这种情况，定会引起高度的重视与关心。全省农民应紧随工人同胞，拿出力量，支援经济建设，把棉花立即卖给国家，或存入人民银行及合作社，以保证全国纱厂的原棉供应，和保证前方将士及广大人民的穿着需要。这是全省农民对于国家一种重要贡献的爱国表示，并且是“公私兼顾”，对国家对人民都有好处的。国家可进一步照顾棉农利益。最近，棉花价格又作了适当调整，并采取了一切合理必要而有利于棉农的措施。因此，本府特向全省棉农和存棉户发出如下号召：
    （一）高度发扬爱国热忱，以实际行动响应中央人民政府售棉储棉号召。存棉户依照合理牌价很快地把存棉尽量卖给国家，或存于国家银行与合作社。人民银行与合作社对存入的棉花，不但保本保值，价格听涨不听落。市价高时，则按市价计算，并且付给利息每月一分二厘。整存整取或零取，取钱或取物，均听存户自便，并可用以抵缴公粮。这样的灵活方便，对存棉户来说，并无丝毫的亏吃，切盼各地存棉同胞，在抗美援朝爱国运动中，同时相互劝勉，开展起一个踊跃的售棉储棉运动，作为我们爱国的实际行动之一。
    （二）各经济部门，要根据群众需要，有计划地积极调供物资，保证棉农生产与生活资料的充足供给。
    （三）各级合作社，各机关生产及财政方面的存棉，必须立即一律转售与国家，不得私存经营或隐匿不交。
    最后我们要求各级人民政府干部，各人民团体及广大农村生产模范，积极努力，广泛宣传把售棉储棉的办法做到家喻户晓，动员全体棉农把这一号召迅速地成为普遍全省的实际行动。
            平原省人民政府布置购棉储棉工作
    【本报新乡二日二十二时专电】平原省人民政府于今日指示各级政府，将政务院指示的购棉、储棉工作作为六、七、八三个月重大任务之一，指示针对各地棉农存棉等待新麦上市购买小麦及生活资料的情况，除号召棉农在夏征中交棉花抵交公粮外，并要求省粮食公司向棉区调剂出售小麦及其他食粮，要求省花纱布公司、省贸易公司等贸易部门，大力向棉区组织供应。指示责成省花纱布公司、合作社及花纱布公司委托的其他代理店，为收购棉花、办理棉花抵交公粮、办理银行存棉生息的业务机关。指示要求各地政府加强市场行政领导，将棉花集中于交易所成交，严格取缔搀假使潮，囤集预售，哄抬价格等非法的商业行为。
            中共平原省委会及苏北区党委号召执行购棉储棉指示
    【本报新乡二日二十二时专电】中国共产党平原省委员会，于今日指示各级党委，立即动员棉产区全体党员、团员、妇联会员、合作社员，以自己的模范作用，推动广大棉农，开展一个抗美援朝保家卫国售棉储棉运动。
    【本报扬州一日专电】今日中共苏北区党委作出决定，号召各级党委执行中共中央为保证胜利完成购棉储棉任务的指示。决定称：
    为坚决执行中共中央关于保证胜利完成购棉储棉任务的指示，区党委特作如下决定：（一）苏北为全国主要棉产区之一，完成这一任务是极其重要的。各级党委在看到中央这一指示后，应该立即传达下去，切实贯彻执行。特别是南通、盐城两地委，必须详细讨论，作出具体部署，直接派人到棉产区去进行这一工作，把它当作目前一项极其紧急重要的任务。（二）棉产区的所有支部和党员要立刻动员起来，响应中央这一号召，坚决以自己的实际行动，来推动全体棉农开展售棉储棉的运动。应该把这一工作当作自己抗美援朝爱国行动的具体表现，以保证这一任务的胜利完成。（三）苏北人民行政公署所发出的关于这一工作的具体决定，各级党委必须坚决加以贯彻实施。
