Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: The British People's Visiting Delegation held a press conference in the capital this afternoon. Kean, the head of the delegation, delivered a statement on behalf of the delegation, summarizing their impressions of this visit to New China. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　We are immensely pleased and honored to be able to visit the People's Republic of China.

　　The Chinese people have liberated themselves, which is a victory for the peace and freedom of people all over the world, and also points out to the oppressed people of all countries that their problems can be solved.

　　We met miners and dockworkers, textile workers and railway workers, professors and students, doctors and cooperative workers—they are all remarkable people.

　　The clear purposefulness shown by the Chinese people, their active democratic style, and their efforts to defend world peace have impressed and inspired us everywhere.

　　The achievements and victories of the Chinese people bring hope to the British people and to all people in the world who are concerned about the struggle against aggression.

　　In every city and in every factory, we have met your model workers. They stand on the same front as the heroic fighting working class of Britain. They are all fighting to defend and promote the interests of the working class and all peace-loving people throughout the world.

　　We have seen the joyful and enthusiastic faces of Chinese children, watched them dance, and listened to them sing, and we have embraced them. They are the brilliant future of China, and we hope that the only relationship between them and our children will be one of friendship.

　　During our trip, we visited a new factory, one of the new types of factories established by People's China after liberation. From its sturdy and beautiful new buildings, excellent machinery, high safety and sanitation equipment, and the cooperation of workers, scientists, technicians, and administrators in solving all production problems, we have seen the industrial future of China.

　　We congratulate the development of Chinese industry under people's management. This development will inevitably promote world prosperity and strengthen the forces of peace.

　　We will especially always remember our visit to the Huainan Coal Mine. When we arrived, the miners and their wives and children stood densely along the road, cheering us, shaking hands with us, and warmly welcoming us.

　　We miners mine coal, which is the lifeblood of industry, and we must always stand together. United, we become a great force for creating a better future for the world.

　　You introduced to us, especially to Comrade Esther Henrotte, the cooperative worker in our delegation, the work of your cooperatives in cities and villages. We believe that the development of Chinese cooperatives we have seen is the greatest development of the cooperative movement in the world in many years. We hope that the British cooperative movement will gain new confidence and feel proud after hearing of your achievements.

　　We have seen hospitals and nurseries, and we know about the increasingly large-scale health campaigns that China has carried out in the past two years. All of us, especially Dr. Michael Rappaport in our delegation, feel that the achievements of these health campaigns are not just a major event in China. They demonstrate that a people's democratic system can eliminate disease and ignorance and the filth and ugliness that come with them. This is undoubtedly a lesson for all of Asia and the world.

　　We British people are proud of the democratic rights that our ancestors fought for in struggles and revolutions. However, China's democracy, active, purposeful, and forward-looking democracy, is a new revelation to us, making us aware of what the people can achieve. We British people can learn a lot from here. Wherever workers lead, democracy rises to a higher level.

　　We have particularly noticed one thing. That is, people in any position seek and accept criticism anytime, anywhere, and the role of criticism is to help educate the people and help solve problems.

　　We came to China as a delegation of peace. Everything we have seen and heard has shown us the peace and friendship between nations. We have seen children and hospitals, cooperatives and workers' cultural palaces, seen workers and factory management concerned with improving production and raising living standards, and seen how the Chinese people eagerly strive for their peaceful construction in a peaceful world.

　　We British people, like the Chinese people, cherish peace and prosperity.

　　Since coming to China, we have realized more deeply that we cannot sit and wait for peace and prosperity. The people must fight for peace and prosperity.

　　Today, China and the world are facing a critical moment. The aggressive forces of the United States are threatening China's borders, and the warmongers are trying to expand the flames of war to the whole world.

　　Everything we have seen in China convinces us that the Chinese people are capable of defending themselves against aggression. Now that we are returning home, we are even more convinced that the people of the world have the power to defeat the warmongers, to force all foreign troops to withdraw from Korea and let the Korean people solve their own problems, and to build a peaceful world.

　　We British people oppose the war manufactured by the United States, and we believe that British troops should withdraw from Korea immediately. We oppose being drawn into a war against China, whether today or tomorrow.

　　The people of China and Britain, who are fighting for their common interests—peace, friendship, and trade—and all other people in the world, will surely be able to defeat the conspiracy of war and win lasting peace.

　　英国人民访问团在京举行记者招待会        
    团长凯恩综述访问新中国观感        
    中国人民的成就和胜利鼓舞着英国人民
    【新华社十一日讯】英国人民访问团今日下午在首都举行记者招待会。访问团团长凯恩代表访问团在会上发表声明，综述此次访问新中国的观感。声明全文如下：
    我们能够来访问中华人民共和国，感到无上的愉快和光荣。
    中国人民解放了自己，这是为全世界人民的和平与自由打了一个胜仗，同时也向各国被压迫的人民指出，他们的问题是可以得到解决的。
    我们遇到了矿工和码头工人，纺织工人和铁路工人，教授和学生，医生和合作社工作者——他们都是了不起的人。
    中国人民所表现的明确的目的性，他们的积极的民主作风，他们保卫世界和平的努力，处处都使我们钦佩，并且给我们以鼓舞。
    中国人民的成就和胜利带给英国人民以希望，带给世界上一切关怀反对侵略的斗争的人民以希望。
    在每一个城市，在每一个工厂中，我们都遇到了你们的劳动模范。他们和我们英国的英勇斗争的工人阶级站在同一战线上。他们都在为保卫和增进全世界工人阶级和所有爱好和平的人民的利益而斗争。
    我们见到了中国儿童欢乐和热情的面容，看到他们的跳舞，听到他们的歌唱，也曾经拥护过他们。他们是中国的辉煌的前途，我们希望在他们和我们的孩子们中间唯一的关系就是友谊的关系。
    在旅行中，我们访问过一个新的工厂，那是人民中国在解放之后建立的新型工厂之一。我们从它的坚固美观的新建筑，极好的机器设置，高度的安全与卫生设备，以及工人、科学家、技术人员和行政方面合作解决一切生产问题的情形中，看见中国的工业前途。
    我们祝贺在人民管理下中国工业的发展。这种发展必然会促进世界的繁荣和加强和平的力量。
    我们尤其永远记得对淮南煤矿的访问。当我们到达时，矿工们和他们的妻子、孩儿密密地站在路旁，向我们欢呼，跟我们握手，热烈地欢迎我们。
    我们矿工所采的是煤，是工业的命脉，我们必须永远站在一起。我们团结起来，就成为创造世界美好将来的巨大力量。
    你们向我们，尤其是向我们代表团中的合作社工作者艾斯特·亨罗特同志，介绍了你们城市和乡村中合作社的工作情况。我们认为我们所看到的中国合作社的发展，是许多年来世界上合作社运动的最伟大的发展。我们希望英国合作社运动在听到你们的成就之后会得到新的信心，并感到骄傲。
    我们看到了医院和托儿所，同时知道了中国两年来所开展的、规模日益扩大的卫生运动。我们全体，尤其是我们代表团中的医生迈克尔·拉巴波特，感觉到这些卫生运动的成就不仅仅是中国的大事。它们说明了人民民主制度能够消灭疾病和愚昧以及随之而来的污秽与丑恶。这毫无疑问地是教育全亚洲和全世界的一课。
    我们英国人对于我们祖先在斗争中革命中为我们所争得的民主权利是引以为荣的。但是，中国的民主，积极的、目标明确的、勇往直前的民主，对于我们却是一个新的启示，使我们知道人民可能争取到什么成就。我们英国人从这里能够学到很多东西。凡是工人领导的地方，民主就提高到更高的水平。
    我们特别注意到一件事。那就是：无论在什么岗位上的人，都随时随地征求和接受批评，同时批评的作用是在帮助教育人民及帮助解决问题。
    我们是作为一个和平的代表团来到中国的。我们所见所闻的一切，向我们说明了各民族间的和平与友好。我们看到了孩子和医院，合作社和工人文化宫，看到了工人和厂方关心着改进生产和提高生活水准，看到了中国人民怎样热望着在一个和平的世界中努力于他们的和平建设。
    我们英国人民，和中国人民一样，珍视和平与繁荣。
    我们自从来到中国以后，更深刻地认识到我们不能坐待和平与繁荣。人民必须用斗争来争取和平与繁荣。
    今天中国与世界正面临着一个紧急关头。美国的侵略势力正威胁着中国的边疆，战争贩子正企图将战争的火焰扩大到全世界。
    我们在中国所看到的一切，使我们确信：中国人民是有能力保卫自己反抗侵略的。现在我们回国的时候，就更确信：世界人民有力量击败战争贩子；有力量迫使一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自行解决自己的问题；有力量建设一个和平世界。
    我们英国人民反对美国所制造的战争，我们相信英国军队应当立即撤出朝鲜。我们无论在今天或明天，都反对被卷入对中国的战争。
    为他们的共同利益：和平、友谊与贸易而斗争的中英两国人民，以及世界上其他一切人民，一定能够击败战争阴谋，赢得持久和平。
