　　Four Private Flour Mills in Jinan Sell Spoiled Flour as Good Flour
　　River Workers Get Sick After Eating It

To the Editor:

　　The private merchants Chengfeng, Maoxing, Huifeng, Baofeng and other flour mills in Jinan City, Shandong Province, engage in speculation and deception, selling bran flour as fourth-grade flour, causing thousands of river workers to become ill after eating it. However, the Jinan Municipal People's Government has failed to give these private merchants appropriate punishment. The details of the matter are as follows:

　　This spring, our county mobilized more than 20,000 migrant workers to carry out the Yi-Shu River Diversion and Regulation Project. Our county suffered severe famine last year, and the families of the migrant workers are experiencing extreme hardship. In order to enable the migrant workers to save money and leave a portion of their wages to stabilize their family life, in February, we exchanged soybeans for 360,000 jin of fourth-grade flour from the four private flour mills of Chengfeng, Huifeng, Maoxing, and Baofeng in Jinan City. At that time, a contract was signed based on the principle of facilitating consumption by the migrant workers. However, after the migrant workers ate this flour, thousands of them experienced common symptoms of headache, back pain, and diarrhea, indicating poisoning. Initially, we thought it was an epidemic, but after examination, the migrant workers said it was caused by eating the flour. We immediately sent doctors for emergency treatment and stopped them from eating the flour, and they began to recover after several days. At that time, we believed that the flour contained toxins, so on March 30th, we sent Secretary Wei of the County General Headquarters, with an official letter from the county government and samples of the flour, to the Jinan Municipal Government to file a complaint. Secretary Wei waited in Jinan City for more than 20 days and, after repeated negotiations and requests with the Jinan Municipal People's Government, finally obtained a chemical analysis. The results of the analysis proved that the flour was non-toxic, but it was entirely made of bran, with no starch, and was not suitable for consumption. During the experiment, five people who ate this flour experienced nausea, a burning sensation in the stomach, intestinal bloating and gas, fermentative dyspepsia, dizziness, and general weakness within four to five hours after consumption.

　　However, the Jinan Municipal People's Government did not assist us in giving appropriate punishment to the four private merchants, Chengfeng, et al. In its response to us, it said: Since the flour does not contain toxic substances, you should resolve the matter yourselves, and suggested that your county consider mixing it with other food grains or vegetables.

　　We disagree with the Jinan Municipal People's Government's response and handling of this matter. We believe that the four private merchants, Chengfeng, et al., in Jinan City, sold inedible bran flour as fourth-grade flour, causing losses to the river workers; such speculative and deceptive behavior towards the people should not be allowed. We demand that the four flour mills, Chengfeng, et al., take back the more than 200,000 jin of bran flour currently in our possession, compensate the migrant workers for the medical expenses incurred from eating this flour, and publicly apologize and admit their mistakes in the newspaper.

Editor's Note: Generally, fourth-grade flour contains around 50% starch. The flour sold by the private Chengfeng and other mills in Jinan City to the Yi-Shu River Project Team in Xin'an County, according to analysis, contains no starch, which is clearly not fourth-grade flour. This kind of malicious deceptive behavior by the private merchants cannot be allowed. The Jinan Municipal People's Government should order the four private merchants to admit their mistakes and compensate for the losses.

### 济南市四家私营面粉厂以坏面冒充好面  河工食后得了病

　　济南市四家私营面粉厂以坏面冒充好面        
    河工食后得了病编辑同志：
    山东济南市私商成丰、茂兴、惠丰、宝丰等面粉厂投机骗人，以麩皮面冒充四等粉出售，使数千河工食后得了病。而济南市人民政府却未能给此等私商以适当处理。此事的经过是这样的：
    今春我县动员两万余民工，进行导沂整沭工程。我县去年灾荒严重，民工家庭生活极为困难。我们为使民工能省吃俭用，余下一部分工资安定家庭生活，曾于二月间向济南市成丰、惠丰、茂兴、宝丰等四家私营面粉厂，以黄豆换回四等面粉三十六万斤。当时并曾订有合同，以便利民工食用为原则。可是当民工吃了这样的面粉后，有数千民工普遍发生头痛、腰痛、泻肚等中毒现象。开始我们还认为是流行病，经检查后，民工说是吃面吃的。我们即派医生急救，并停止吃这面粉，数天后始见恢复。当时我们认为面粉里有毒质，即于三月三十日派县总队部魏秘书，持县府公函及该面粉样品，到济南市府提起控诉。魏秘书在济南市等了二十余天，和济南市人民政府几经交涉，一再要求，始得化验。化验结果，证明此面粉无毒，但全系麩皮制成，无淀粉，不能供食用，在试验时，有五人吃了这种面粉，在食后四、五小时内同样发生恶心，胃口烧灼感，肠内充气膨胀，有发酵性消化不良，头目胀晕，全身脱力等症状。
    但济南市人民政府却不协助我们对成丰等四家私商给以恰当的处理，在给我们的答复中则说：该项面粉既然不含毒质，应由你们自行解决，建议由你县酌情掺杂其他食粮或青菜食用。
    我们不同意济南市人民政府对此事的答复和处理意见。我们认为济南市成丰等四家私商以不能食用的麸皮面假充四等面粉出售，使治河民工受到损失；这种投机取巧，欺骗人民的行为是不应被允许的。我们要求成丰等四家面粉厂收回现存于我处的二十余万斤麸皮面，赔偿民工因吃这种面粉所用的医药费，并由他们在报纸上公开检讨，承认错误。
                      苏北区新安县导沂整沭工程总队部
    编者按：一般四等面粉的成份，含有百分之五十上下的淀粉质。济南市私营成丰等厂卖给新安县导沂工程队的面粉，据化验并无淀粉质，这显然不是四等面粉。该私商这种恶劣的欺骗行为，是不能允许的。济南市人民政府应责令该四家私商承认错误，并赔偿损失。
