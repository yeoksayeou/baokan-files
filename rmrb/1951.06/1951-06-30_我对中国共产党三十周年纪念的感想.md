    My Thoughts on the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party
    Zheng Yun, Teacher at the Second Attached Elementary School of Beijing Normal University
    The thirtieth birthday of the Chinese Communist Party has arrived, and I am very happy. I want to express my congratulations and gratitude to the Party. I love the Party and see the Party members as family, so I got a nickname early on: "Eighth Route Army Fan." Yes, I admit I am an Eighth Route Army Fan.
    Why do I love the Chinese Communist Party so much? It's a long story. I am a primary school teacher who has taught for thirty-four years and am now fifty-four years old. In the old society, primary school teachers had no political status. Especially female teachers; when they got old, they were even more looked down upon. People called me "Child King" and "Little Primary School Teacher," enduring people's cold eyes and contempt. Over time, I developed a sense of inferiority. Walking on the street, I hid my school badge. When students saluted me on the street, I felt embarrassed, afraid people would know I was a primary school teacher.
    The dormitory I lived in at school was a small room that never saw the light of day and was damp and dark. I lived there for nine years, and my legs became ill because of it. When I was seriously ill, I asked for leave to recuperate at home. After only a month, the principal sent someone to urge me: "Is Teacher Zheng still going to teach or not?" If I didn't teach, I would lose my job and have nothing to eat. There was no choice. With tears in my eyes and enduring the pain, I went back to school to teach.
    During the occupation period, my monthly salary was not enough to buy snacks. I had to eat cornmeal mixed with sand. Because of malnutrition, my eyes often saw stars, and I felt flustered. I lived my life year after year with such hardship. I really had no place to express my suffering. I always thought: I must fight; I cannot let the evil society defeat me. The light will come soon.
    Finally, Beijing was liberated. The Communist Party came. We primary school teachers were emancipated and honorably called "People's Teachers," receiving love and respect from the people everywhere. Especially the Communist Party members who helped me and educated me, making me feel warm. After studying in the political training class, my awareness improved, and my courage increased. For the sake of my colleagues' learning and for the sake of union work, I forgot everything. In thought and action, the Communist Party has made me younger.
    I joined the trade union, was elected as a representative of the people of Beijing, and was also honorably elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Having become the master of my own house, my status has greatly improved. But I realize that without the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would I be today? It can be said that my glory was given to me by the Communist Party and belongs to the Communist Party. I love the Communist Party, I am grateful to the Communist Party, and I want to assure the Communist Party: I will contribute everything I have to the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign and the great cultural construction of the motherland, and teach the next generation of the motherland well.

### 我对中国共产党三十周年纪念的感想

    我对中国共产党三十周年纪念的感想
    北京师大二附小教员  郑芸
    中国共产党三十岁的生日到了，我很高兴。我要向党表示庆贺，表示感激。我热爱党，把党员同志们也看成亲人，所以早先得了一个外号：“八路迷”。——是的，我承认是个八路迷。
    我为什么那么热爱中国共产党呢？说起来话长得很。我是教了三十四年书的小学教员，现在五十四岁了。在旧社会里，小学教员是没有政治地位的。尤其是女教员，年纪老了，更是被人瞧不起。人家管我叫“小孩王”、“小学教员儿”，受尽人们的冷眼和轻视。日子久了，我就产生了自卑心理，走在街上，把校徽藏起来，学生在街上给我敬礼，我都不好意思，怕人知道我是小学教员。
    我在学校住的宿舍，是一间长年不见天日、潮湿阴暗的小屋，一住就是九年，我的腿因此生了病。病重了，请假回家休养，刚住一个月，校长就派人来催：“郑老师还教不教呢？”不教就得失业，没有饭吃。没有办法，含着眼泪，忍着疼痛，又到学校去上课。
    在沦陷期间，每月薪水不够买点心吃，只好吃掺沙子的棒子面。因为营养不良，眼睛常冒金花，心里发慌。就这样，一年一年地艰苦地过着日子，真是有苦没处说。我总想：我要斗争，不能叫万恶的社会打倒我，光明不久就会来的。
    好了，北京解放了。共产党来了。我们小学教员翻了身，荣称为“人民教师”，到处受到人民的爱戴，尤其是共产党员们帮助我，教育我，使我感到温暖。经过政治训练班的学习，自己觉悟提高，勇气增加了。为了同仁的学习，为了工会工作，忘了一切，在思想上，行动上，共产党使我年青了。
    我参加了工会，被选为北京市人民代表，又光荣的当选为北京市人民政府委员，当了家作了主人，我的地位大大地提高了。可是我认识到要是没有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，我那里有今天，可以说我的光荣是共产党给我的，是属于共产党的。我热爱共产党，我感激共产党，要向共产党保证：在抗美援朝与祖国伟大的文化建设中，贡献出我的一切；教好祖国的第二代。
