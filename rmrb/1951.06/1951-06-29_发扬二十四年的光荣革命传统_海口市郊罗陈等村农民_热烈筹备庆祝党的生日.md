　　The people of Luochen and Luwu villages in the suburbs of Haikou, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. Twenty-four years ago, the Chinese Communist Party led the peasants here in a struggle against feudal forces and established the first peasant revolutionary organization, the Zhongkai Township Peasants' Association. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, the reactionary rulers slaughtered Communists and dissolved the peasants' associations everywhere. However, the peasants of Luochen and Luwu villages were unyielding, and they firmly believed that the revolution would be victorious. They vowed: not to work for the reactionary government and not to be members of the feudal "village defense corps." They preserved the red flag of the Peasants' Association and secretly took it out to sun it once a year. The members of the Peasants' Association often listened for news of the Red Army. Sometimes, they heard news of the Red Army's victory from Kuomintang soldiers who had been defeated and secretly spread the word. In 1949, in order to assist the People's Liberation Army crossing the sea, the entire village of more than 140 households borrowed five stones of grain in one night. Wu Guangxiang, an old Peasants' Association member, veteran Communist Party member, and boatman, gave his life in the cross-sea battle.

　　Last year, when the people of Haikou celebrated the "August 1st" Army Day, the people of Luochen and Luwu villages presented the glorious red flag—the flag of the Zhongkai Township Peasants' Association—to Comrade Feng Baiju, the current Secretary of the Hainan District Party Committee of the CPC, who had personally led them in establishing the Peasants' Association more than twenty years ago.

　　When the proposal to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party on "July 1st" this year was put forward, Lin Hongfa, a member of the old Peasants' Association, said excitedly: "The Communist Party is our savior. We must enthusiastically celebrate the Communist Party's birthday!" On the 16th, the old Peasants' Association members and the entire village unanimously passed a resolution to decorate the entire village with lanterns to celebrate "July 1st." They also passed resolutions to prepare for the establishment of a peasants' association, complete land reform, increase grain production, donate airplanes and artillery, and rename the village primary school "Zhongkai Primary School" to warmly celebrate the birthday of the Communist Party.

　　发扬二十四年的光荣革命传统
    海口市郊罗陈等村农民  热烈筹备庆祝党的生日
    有着光荣的革命传统的海口市郊罗陈、橹梧两村人民，正在热烈筹备庆祝中国共产党三十周年纪念日。二十四年前，中国共产党就在这里领导农民进行了反对封建势力的斗争，建立了第一个农民革命组织仲凯乡农民协会。一九二七年蒋介石叛变革命后，反动统治者到处屠杀共产党员，解散农民协会。但是，罗陈、橹梧两村农民不屈不挠，他们都坚信革命一定能得到胜利。他们宣誓：不给反动政府办事，不做封建“乡团”团丁。他们把农会的红旗保存了下来，并且每年秘密地拿出来晒它一次。农民协会的会员们经常探听着红军的消息，有时从吃了败仗的国民党士兵的口中听到红军胜利的消息，就暗地传告。一九四九年，为了接应渡海的人民解放军，全村一百四十余户，一晚就筹借了五石粮食。老农会会员、老共产党员、船工吴广祥在渡海作战中献出了自己的生命。
    去年，海口全市人民庆祝“八一”建军节时，罗陈、橹梧两村人民向二十余年前曾亲自领导他们建立农会、现任中共海南区党委书记的冯白驹同志献出了这面光荣的红旗——仲凯乡农民协会会旗。
    当今年筹备庆祝“七一”共产党建立三十周年的建议提出后，老农民协会委员林宏发兴奋地说：“共产党是咱们的救星，共产党的生日，咱们要热热烈烈地庆祝一番！”十六日，罗陈、橹梧两村的老农会会员和全村人民，一致通过了全村张灯结彩庆祝“七一”的决议。还通过了筹备建立农会，完成土地改革；增产粮食，捐献飞机大炮；并把村小学校改为“仲凯小学校”，热烈庆祝共产党的生日的决议。
