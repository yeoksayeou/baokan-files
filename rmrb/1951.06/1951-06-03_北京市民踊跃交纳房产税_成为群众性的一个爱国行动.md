Beijing Citizens Enthusiastically Pay Property Tax
    Becoming a Mass Patriotic Action
    In the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, the vast majority of Beijing citizens have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in both their political understanding and their practical actions. The payment of property tax, which has the broadest and most universal impact, is a striking example. Property tax differs from industrial and commercial tax; the taxpayers are the vast number of residents. Among the more than 100,000 taxpayers, there are different classes, different occupations, and different abilities to pay. In the past, late payments and tax arrears were relatively serious. Since the summer property tax was levied on May 1st this year, the situation has obviously changed. Ninety-five percent has already been completed. Citizens in various districts and streets have actively and enthusiastically paid collectively and in advance in various ways. Most streets and lanes have included early collective payment of property tax in their patriotic covenants. In order to continue this honorable action more universally, district and street representatives, heads of industrial and commercial groups, hygiene committee members, and local activists and enlightened property owners have automatically formed long-term organizations to better carry out collective tax payment in a prepared and planned manner. As of now, 114 groups (6,500 households) have been formed in the Third District, and 46 groups (2,200 households) have been formed in the Ninth District. The groups in the Eighth District voluntarily offer to deliver tax payment notices to promote why taxes should be paid door-to-door.
    This mass patriotic movement has a certain political foundation. As citizen Ma Dequan said, "Paying taxes is a duty, and paying it one day earlier will increase our strength to resist America, aid Korea, and consolidate national defense by one point."

　　北京市民踊跃交纳房产税
    成为群众性的一个爱国行动
    在抗美援朝运动中，北京市广大市民无论在政治认识上和在实际行动中，都已高度地显示了爱国主义精神。即就负担面最广最普遍的房产税的交纳情形来看，也是一个显著的例证。房产税不同于工商业税，纳税人是广大居民。在十余万纳税户中，包括不同阶层，不同职业，负担能力也各不相同。以往滞纳和欠税的情形是比较严重的。今年夏季房产税，自五月一日开征以来，情况已有显然的变化。现已完成百分之九十五强。各区市民，各个街道，纷纷以不同的方式，积极踊跃地集体交纳、提前交纳。大部分街巷，都把提前集体交纳房地产税列入爱国公约。为了把这件荣誉的行动，更普遍地坚持下去，大部地区的区街代表，工商小组长，卫生委员，联合了当地积极分子和开明业主，都自动结合成了长期性的组织，以便有准备有计划地把集体纳税做得更好。截至目前，三区已组成了一百一十四个小组（六千五百户），九区已组成了四十六个小组（二千二百户），八区的小组，自动地愿代送交款通知书，以便挨户宣传为什么纳税。
    这一群众性的爱国运动，是有一定的政治基础的。市民马德泉说的好：“纳税是应尽的义务，早一天交，就早一天增加抗美援朝和巩固国防的一分力量。”
