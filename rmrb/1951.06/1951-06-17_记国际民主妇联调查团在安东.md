　　A Record of the Investigation Delegation of the International Democratic Women's Federation in Andong
    Xu Bin
    The "Investigation Delegation of the International Democratic Women's Federation on the Atrocities of the American Military in Korea," organized by the International Democratic Women's Federation, arrived in Andong City, China, on the afternoon of May 29 after conducting an on-site investigation in Korea to investigate the atrocities of American aircraft bombing Andong.
    The antique market in Andong originally had neat shops, restaurants, hotels, and residences, but a month ago, all these beautiful buildings were turned into ruins by American aircraft bombing. Now, what is presented to the delegates of the investigation delegation are just broken bricks, rubble, bomb fragments, and bomb craters.
    While the representatives of the investigation delegation were carefully investigating and recording the atrocities of American imperialism on the ruins, more than a dozen victimized women and children from Andong City came to the representatives to tell them about the family destruction caused by the American aircraft bombing and to request them to condemn this to the just people of the world.
    The first to accuse was Yu Zhou, the wife of a worker in Andong City. She was holding a baby in her arms whose father was still alive a month ago. However, he was killed by an American aircraft on April 7. Yu Zhou told how American imperialism destroyed her happy family and took away her husband. At this time, unbearable pain and anger caused the muscles on her face to convulse. She told the delegates of the investigation delegation that she had only one thought: to rebuild her home with her own labor, step up the resistance against America and aid to Korea, and fight back against the American aggressors!
    The next to accuse was a twelve-year-old child named Liu Xiangliang, a student at the Central Complete Primary School in Andong City. In the past, whenever he came home from school, he could see his mother waiting for him at the door to eat dinner from afar. However, on April 12, when he came home from school, he not only did not see his mother, but he could not even see his home. There was smoke and flames everywhere, and broken bricks and rubble everywhere. When he saw this situation, he immediately burst into tears. He ran a few steps and suddenly found that a bloody corpse lying on the ground was his mother. He immediately fainted. When he woke up, the rescue team had already dug out the bodies of his grandfather, grandmother, and younger sister from the bomb crater...
    He told the representative who was stroking his head that now his life was being taken care of by the People's Government, and the government continued to provide him with schooling. He said: "I must keep this hatred in my heart forever, and I must avenge my whole family who were killed, and avenge my mother!"
    The accusations of these victimized mothers and children moved every representative of the investigation delegation. One representative walked up to two children who had lost their parents, pressed her face tightly against the children's faces, and said: "Hearing your accusations immediately reminds me of the situation in Korea: mothers were murdered there, and those dead children were still lying on their mothers' backs... Who gave you these disasters? Everyone with a conscience knows it very well!"
    The victims one by one accused the American imperialists of their atrocities. They requested that the investigation delegation, after returning to their countries, could convey the truth about the suffering they had endured to the mothers and all the just people of the world, expose the crimes of American imperialism in destroying human happiness and peace, and let the mothers and all peace-loving people of the world unite closely to stop the aggression of American imperialism.
    The representatives carefully investigated the traces left by the atrocities of American aircraft. One representative found a lock of disheveled hair under a broken tile. After looking at it carefully, he was silent for a long while, and then picked it up and said very sadly, "This is a woman's hair!" Mrs. Rode, the head of the investigation delegation, recorded this incident in her investigation book.
    Mrs. Rode picked up a broken cup from the ground, looked at it, and said: "I want to take it back home as a souvenir. Every time I see this cup, I will think of the 'peace' of the American robbers to the Chinese people!"
    When the investigation delegation was about to leave Andong after conducting an on-site investigation of the atrocities of the American aircraft's barbaric bombing, the Andong City Democratic Women's Federation presented each representative with a gift, which was a glass box containing bomb fragments left by the American aircraft bombing Andong. And on the box was written:
    "Dear international friends: Please see! These are the bomb fragments left by the American imperialist aircraft when they bombed Andong City. This is the ironclad evidence of American imperialism's invasion of China's airspace and massacre of the Chinese people. Please convey and report the truth about the atrocities of American imperialism to the peace-loving people all over the world!"

　　记国际民主妇联调查团在安东
    徐彬
    国际民主妇女联合会组织的“侵朝美军暴行调查团”，在朝鲜实地进行调查后，于五月二十九日下午抵达我国安东市，调查美国飞机轰炸安东的暴行。
    安东的古物市场本来有着整齐的商店、饭店、旅社和住宅，但在一个月前，这一切美好的建筑物都在美国飞机的轰炸下变成废墟了。现在展现在调查团的代表们面前的，只是些破砖残瓦、炸弹片和炸弹坑。
    当调查团的代表们正在废墟上仔细地调查和记载美帝国主义的暴行时，安东市的十几个受难的妇女和儿童来到代表们面前，要把美国飞机轰炸使她（他）们家破人亡的事实告诉代表们，请求她们向全世界的正义的人民控诉。
    第一个控诉的是于周氏，她是安东市一个工人的妻子，她怀里抱着一个婴儿，这个婴儿的父亲一个月前还活着，但是，就在四月七日那天，被美国飞机炸死了。于周氏诉说美帝国主义如何摧毁了她幸福的家庭并夺去了她的丈夫，这时，难以忍受的痛苦和愤怒使她脸上的肌肉都挛痉了。她告诉调查团的代表们说她只有一个想法：就是用自己的劳动重建家园，加紧抗美援朝，回击美国侵略者！
    接着控诉的是一个十二岁的孩子，他名叫刘相良，是安东市中央完全小学校的学生。过去，每当他放学回家时，远远地就可以看到妈妈在门口等他回家吃饭，可是四月十二日那天，他放学回家，不仅没有看到妈妈，而且连他的家也看不到了。到处是浓烟和火焰，到处是破砖残瓦。他看到这种情形，立刻大哭起来。他跑了几步，突然发现躺在地上的一个血淋淋的尸体就是他的妈妈，他立刻晕倒了。当他醒来时，救护队已经从炸弹坑里把他的祖父、祖母和小妹妹的尸体都掘出来了……
    他告诉正在抚摸着他的头的那位代表说，现在他的生活都由人民政府照顾，政府并继续供他上学。他说：“我一定要把这仇恨永远记在心里，一定要为被炸死的全家报仇，为母亲报仇！”
    这受难的母亲和孩子的控诉，感动了调查团的每位代表。有一位代表走到两个失去了父母的孩子跟前，把脸紧贴着孩子们的脸，她说：“听到你们的控诉，使我立刻回忆起朝鲜的情景：在那里母亲们被残杀了，那些死去的孩子们还躺在妈妈的背上……这些灾难是谁给你们的呢？每个有良心的人都是很清楚的！”
    受难者一个个地向调查团控诉美帝国主义的暴行。他们要求调查团回国后，能将他们所遭受的苦难的真相向全世界的母亲们和一切正义的人们传达报告，揭露美帝国主义破坏人类幸福与和平的罪行，让全世界的母亲们和一切爱好和平的人们，紧密地团结起来，制止美帝国主义的侵略。
    代表们仔细地调查美机暴行留下的痕迹。一位代表在一块破瓦片下发现一束乱发，仔细地看了又看，他沉默了好大一会，然后把它拿起来，十分沉痛地说：“这是一个女人的头发！”调查团团长罗德夫人在旁边把这件事记到她的调查簿上去了。
    罗德夫人在地上拾起一个被炸破了的杯子，看了看，她说：“我要把它带回国去作为纪念。当我每看到这只杯子时，我就会想起美国强盗们对中国人民的‘和平’！”
    调查团在安东实地调查了美国飞机野蛮轰炸的暴行后，要离开安东时，安东市民主妇女联合会赠送代表们每人一件礼物，这件礼物就是装着美机轰炸安东时遗留下的炸弹片的玻璃盒。并在盒子上面写着：
    “亲爱的国际友人们：请看！这就是美帝国主义的飞机轰炸安东市时遗留下的炸弹片，这是美帝国主义侵犯中国领空、屠杀中国人民的铁证。请你们把美帝国主义暴行的真相，传达报告给全世界爱好和平的人民！”
