　　Political Study Class for Beijing Private Vocational Remedial Schools
    There are more than 110 private vocational remedial schools in Beijing, including accounting, typing, sewing, shorthand, radio, and other subjects, with a total of about 6,000 students. Among these students, the vast majority are unemployed or out-of-school youth and housewives who hope to learn a skill in order to find work. They have not received systematic political and ideological education and lack basic political knowledge, and they are eager to study politics. However, most of the private vocational remedial schools are small, and the schools are limited by funding, teachers, and other conditions, and it is not yet possible to add political classes; the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education does not yet have the capacity to take care of them. Therefore, the Youth Service Department decided to assist the government in solving the political education problems of these young people during this transitional period and organized the "Political Study Class for Students of Beijing Private Vocational Remedial Schools." The study class started on January 14th this year, and the total number of people who have participated in the study so far is about 2,000.

    After three months of study, the students' political and ideological level has been improved: they have initially established a revolutionary outlook on life, knowing that participating in work is to serve the people rather than simply to solve personal livelihood problems; they have changed their view of despising labor, knowing that history is created by the working people; they have clarified the nature of the current national politics and the international status, and eliminated national inferiority complex; in addition, they have realized the bright future of the country and distinguished between enemies and friends internationally. Moreover, after learning that the purpose of learning technology is to participate in the country's production and construction, their learning initiative and enthusiasm have been greatly improved, and they consciously abide by the school's rules and discipline. The school administration feels that "after the students participate in political studies, running the school is also easier."

　　北京私立职业补习学校政治学习班
    北京市私立职业补习学校共有一百一十余处，包括会计、打字、缝纫、速记、无线电等多种，共有学生六千人左右。在这些学生中，绝大多数是希望学得一技之长以便寻找工作的失业、失学青年和家庭妇女。他们没有受过系统的政治思想教育，缺乏基本的政治常识，迫切地要求学习政治。但是，私立职业补习学校多半规模很小，学校限于经费、师资等条件，还不可能增设政治课；北京市文教局一时也还没有力量照顾到他们。因此，青年服务部决定在这个过渡时期内协助政府来解决这些青年的政治教育问题，主办了“北京市私立职业补习学校学生政治学习班”。今年一月十四日学习班开课，到现在总计先后参加学习的人数约二千人。
    经过三个月的学习，学生们的政治思想水平提高了：初步建立了革命的人生观，知道参加工作是为人民服务而不是单纯为了解决个人的生活问题；改变了轻视劳动的观点，知道历史是劳动人民创造的；明确了当前国家政治的性质和国际地位，消除了民族自卑感；此外，更认识到国家的光明前途，分清了国际上的敌、友。而且，在了解到学习技术目的在于参加国家的生产建设事业后，学习主动性、积极性大大提高，自觉地遵守学校的制度、纪律。学校行政方面感到：“学生参加政治学习后，办学校也容易了。”
