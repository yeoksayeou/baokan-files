Opposing Irresponsible Attitudes in Construction Work

Beijing Yongmao Construction Company's Mechanical Brick Kiln Factory Disregards Government Regulations
Resulting in a Serious Accident Where a Newly Built Factory Building Collapsed, Killing and Injuring Workers

The responsible cadres of the Mechanical Brick Kiln Factory of Beijing Yongmao Construction Company neglected the government's regulations on construction projects and blindly trusted the contracting foremen, resulting in a serious accident where a newly built project collapsed, killing workers. On May 29th, the factory's newly built factory building in the northern suburbs of Beijing, which was not yet completed, was washed down by heavy rain, killing five workers and injuring twenty-three workers.

At the end of April this year, the responsible cadres of the factory decided to build forty new factory buildings. In order to speed things up, they carelessly contracted the project to construction foremen Cui Qichang, Yin Diankui, and Yin Guohua and others, who had not registered with the government. According to the regulations of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, construction foremen who have not registered with the government are not allowed to contract construction projects. As a unit of the construction company, the factory adopted a negligent attitude towards the government's regulations. For the construction of such a large project, according to the regulations of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, a survey and research should have been conducted in advance to produce reliable design drawings, which should be submitted to the government for approval before construction could begin. Qian Zhengrong, the deputy director of the factory, casually drew a design drawing, which was not approved by the Beijing Municipal People's Government. However, Qian Zhengrong believed that "drawing is a procedure to deal with superiors, and building a house is another matter." On May 7th, they started construction privately without design drawings. On May 20th, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau learned about this matter and sent people to investigate and repeatedly notified them to stop work. But they still did not listen and continued construction.

The responsible cadres of the factory thought that once the new construction project was handed over to the contracting foremen, everything would be fine. During the construction process, they did not send a single supervisor to supervise the project; they did not ask about any problems during construction. They only knew how big the factory building should be, but they did not know how many rafters there should be, how big the pillars should be, or how the frames should be connected. They only trusted the contracting foremen. Once, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the responsible cadres of the factory were afraid that the new factory building would not be able to withstand the strong wind, so they asked the contracting foremen: "Can the house withstand such a strong wind?" The contracting foremen replied: "It can withstand it!" After the strong wind passed, the responsible cadres of the factory did not carefully check whether there were any changes in the factory building. Seeing that the house had not collapsed, they thought that there was nothing wrong with the work of the contracting foremen. Under the control of this kind of thinking, they allowed the contracting foremen to steal materials and cut corners without restraint. The walls of the newly built factory building were made of adobe bricks, and the thickness was only seven or eight inches; the roof was made of fir wood, and the rafters were as thin as willow branches, which were very easy to break; it was covered with reed mats and a layer of mud, and that was it. In order to fill the foundation, the contractors even dug up mud within a foot of the foundation; regardless of whether the foundation would be affected by this. Under this circumstance, the twenty factory buildings naturally collapsed when it rained heavily.

Qian Zhengrong, the deputy director of the factory, claimed to be an amateur who did not understand technology, but he took an extremely imprudent attitude towards such a complex task as new construction. He did not accept the government's instructions and supervision. This irresponsible attitude towards the people's property has reached an intolerable level.

The responsible cadres of the factory trusted the contracting foremen so much; but they turned a blind eye to the life and death of the workers. The responsible person of the factory saw every day that the construction workers were not eating well and not sleeping warmly, but thought: "This is the business of the contracting foremen, it has nothing to do with me." No one cared that the contracting foremen did not pay the workers. The workers lived in mat sheds. Whenever it rained, the water flowed down from the top of the mat after the rain, soaking the workers' beds. The workers could not live in the mat sheds, so they had to hide in the new factory buildings to avoid the rain. As a result, the factory buildings were washed down by heavy rain, and many workers were unfortunately killed and injured.

This painful lesson has not aroused the attention of the leading cadres of Beijing Yongmao Construction Company. Recently, a worker's shed collapsed on the construction site of the Nationalities Institute undertaken by the company, injuring workers. The leading cadres of the company only instructed the site personnel to make a review, which is not enough. They should also recognize the seriousness of this issue from their own thinking, and earnestly act in accordance with government regulations to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents.

Editor's note: The collapse of the newly built factory building at the Mechanical Brick Kiln Factory of Beijing Yongmao Construction Company is a very serious issue. Before the start of the project, no investigation or research was conducted, and no precise design was made; during the project, no supervision or inspection was carried out, and the contracting foremen were allowed to steal materials and cut corners at will, and shirk responsibility, resulting in significant losses to national construction and workers' lives. This is a very bad bureaucratic style of work, which cannot be tolerated. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will thoroughly investigate this incident and publish the results of the handling in the newspaper.

　　反对修建工作中的不负责的态度
    北京永茂建筑公司机械砖窑厂玩忽政府法规        
    发生新建厂房倒塌压死压伤工人的严重事故
    北京市永茂建筑公司机械砖窑厂负责干部忽视政府关于修建工程的规定，盲目地相信包工工头，造成新建工程倒塌，压死工人的严重事故。五月二十九日，该厂在北京市北郊新建的厂房还未竣工，就被大雨冲垮，砸死工人五名，砸伤工人二十三名。
    今年四月底，该厂负责干部决定新修厂房四十间。他们为了图快，马马虎虎地把这个工程包给未向政府登记的包工工头崔其昌、尹殿魁和尹国华等人修建。按照北京市人民政府规定，凡未向政府登记的包工工头是不能包修工程的。该厂既为建筑公司的一个单位，对于政府的规定却采取玩忽态度。修建这样大的工程，依据北京市人民政府的规定，事先应该勘查研究，做出可靠的设计图样，交给政府批准，然后才能开工。该厂副厂长钱正荣只是随便地画了一个设计图样，这个设计图样未被北京市人民政府批准。但钱正荣却认为：“绘图是应付上级的手续，修房子却是另外一回事。”五月七日，他们在没有设计图样的情况下私自动工了。五月二十日北京市人民政府建设局才知道了这件事，即派人调查，并一再通知他们停工。但他们仍然不听，继续施工。
    该厂负责干部以为把新修工程交给了包工工头，就万事大吉了。在施工过程中，他们没有派过一个监工人员去监督工程；对于施工中的问题，不闻不问。他们只知厂房该修多大，但不知道房椽应有多少，不知道房柱要多大尺寸，不知道房架怎样接。他们只信赖包工工头。有一次，大风骤起，该厂负责干部害怕新厂房挡不住大风，就去问包工工头：“这样大的风，房子挡得住吗？”包工工头答复：“挡得住！”大风过后，该厂负责干部不仔细看看厂房究竟有无变动，只看着房子没有倒，就以为包工工头的工作没有毛病。他们在这样的思想支配之下，就放任包工工头肆无忌惮地偷工减料。新修厂房的墙壁是用土坯砌成的，而且厚度只有七、八寸；房顶是用杉木搭成的，房椽是细如柳条，非常容易折断；上盖苇席，加一层泥土，就算完工了。为了填地基，包工们竟在距离墙基不过一尺远的地方取挖泥土；却不管墙基是否会因此受到影响。在这种情况下，大雨一下，二十间厂房自然就垮了。
    该厂副厂长钱正荣自称外行不懂技术，但对新建工程如此复杂的工作，却又采取了极不慎重的态度。他对于政府的指示与监督也不接受。这种对人民财产不负责的态度已到了不能容忍的地步了。
    该厂负责干部对于包工工头是那样地信赖；但对于工人的死活，却置之不理。该厂负责人天天看见建筑工人吃不好，睡不暖，却以为：“这是包工工头的事，与我无干。”包工工头不给工人工资，也无人过问。工人们住的是席棚，每逢落雨，雨后席顶上流下，浸湿工人的卧铺。工人不能住在席棚内，只好躲在新建厂房内避雨。结果厂房被大雨冲垮，许多工人就不幸地被砸死和砸伤。
    这个惨痛的教训，并未引起北京市永茂建筑公司领导干部的重视。最近该公司所承修的民族学院工地又发生了工棚坍塌砸伤工人的事件。该公司领导干部只是责成工地人员检讨，这是不够的，还应从自己思想上，来认识这个问题的严重性，切实依照政府的法规办事，以避免类似事件的再度发生。
                                            （邵炜  陈迹）
    编者按：北京市永茂建筑公司机械砖窑厂发生的新建厂房倒塌事故，是一个十分严重的问题。在工程开始前，不调查研究，不精确设计；在工程进行中，不督促检查，而任凭包工工头随意偷工减料，敷衍塞责，致造成国家建设和工人生命的重大损失，这是非常恶劣的官僚主义作风，是不能容许的。希望有关机关彻查这一事件，并将处理结果在报上公布。
