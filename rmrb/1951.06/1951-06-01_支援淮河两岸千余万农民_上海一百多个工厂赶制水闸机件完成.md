　　Supporting Over Ten Million Farmers on Both Banks of the Huai River
    Shanghai Over 100 Factories Rush to Produce Sluice Gate Parts, Task Completed
    For the safety of the lives and property of farmers on both banks of the Huai River, more than 100 factories in Shanghai have been working day and night for two months to rush produce parts for the Huai River flood control sluice gates, which have now been completed, and all meet the required specifications. The sluice gates are used to control the flood flow of the Huai River in the middle and lower reaches and must be installed on the construction site before the flood season of the Huai River arrives at the end of June. In order to complete this huge and urgent manufacturing task as soon as possible, the East China Industrial Department has carried out detailed work in organizing production capacity and allocating labor.
    In the process of manufacturing sluice gate parts, more than 10,000 workers in various factories have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creative wisdom. Many workers realized: "This is related to the lives of more than ten million disaster-stricken farmers brothers on both sides of the Huai River," "The Huai River won't wait for you if the task is not completed ahead of schedule." The lathe workers of the Wusong Machine Factory originally used high-speed steel knives to turn the inner wall of the oil pressure cylinder, which was very inefficient. Later, they and technicians repeatedly researched and changed to cemented carbide knives, which increased the efficiency by 5.6 times. After they finished turning the inner wall of the 50 oil pressure cylinders of their factory, they also helped the Second Machine Shipbuilding United Enterprise. They proposed: "If any brother factory is behind schedule, we will help. Completing the task one day earlier will guarantee the safety of the farmers brothers on both sides of the Huai River." During the most tense stage of production, the coping brick of the small furnace door of the steelmaking furnace of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company No. 1 Factory suddenly fell off. Li Jingming, a technician in the workshop who had suffered from the Huai River disaster, immediately led the workers to lift the furnace cover, cover the high heat at the bottom of the furnace with scrap iron, and block the furnace wall with iron sheets. They jumped into the furnace one by one to repair the hole. They fought against the high temperature for two hours, saving more than four days of cold repair time. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　支援淮河两岸千余万农民
    上海一百多个工厂赶制水闸机件完成
    为了淮河两岸农民生命财产的安全，上海市百余家工厂两月以来日夜赶制淮河防洪水闸的机件，现已全部完成，质量都合于规格。水闸是用来控制淮河中、下游洪水流量的，必须在六月底淮河汛期到来以前在工地安装好。为了使这项巨大而紧急的制造任务能够及早完成，华东工业部曾进行了组织生产能力和调配劳动力的细致工作。
    在制造水闸机件的过程中，各厂万余工人都发挥了高度的劳动热情和创造智慧。许多工人都认识到：“这是与淮河两岸一千几百万受灾农民兄弟生命相关的事情呀”，“不能提前完成任务，淮河不等你”。吴淞机器厂的车工们，原用高速钢刀车油压筒内壁，效率很低，后起他们和技术人员反复研究，改用硬质合金刀，使效率提高了五点六倍。他们车完本厂五十个油压筒内壁后，又帮助第二机器造船联营所工作。他们提出：“那一家兄弟厂来不及，我们就帮忙，早一天完成任务，就是对淮河两岸农民兄弟的安全多一分保证。”中国纺织机器制造公司第一厂的炼钢炉，在生产最紧张阶段，小炉门的花圈砖突然掉下了。该车间曾身受淮河灾害的技工李敬明立即带领工人吊开炉盖，用废铁块盖住炉底的高热，用铁皮挡住炉墙，一个个跳进炉子里去补洞。他们与高温搏斗了两小时，结果节省了四天以上的冷修时间。（新华社）
