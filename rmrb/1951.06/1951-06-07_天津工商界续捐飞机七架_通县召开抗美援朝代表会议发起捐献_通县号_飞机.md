Now they need airplanes and artillery to eliminate the enemy in large quantities, and we fully support their demands." Farmer representative Liu Qi assured the conference that after returning to the village, he would widely publicize the appeal of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to the farmers, so that every farmer would do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and carry out the donation campaign.
