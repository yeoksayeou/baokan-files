　　The cotton farmers in Shijiazhuang and Dingxian Special Districts of Hebei Province are now enthusiastically launching a patriotic cotton sales and storage campaign.
    In Shijiazhuang Special District, 31,000 villages have already held emergency mobilization meetings for patriotic cotton sales by Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists. Over 46,000 Communist Party members and cooperative members in the entire special district have sold or deposited all their stored cotton to state-designated economic organs. They are also conducting propaganda and mobilization work among cotton farmers to sell and store cotton, making the broad masses of cotton farmers aware of the importance of the state's cotton purchase. Li Xilu, a Communist Party member from Dongyangshi Village, Lecheng County, mobilized his family to sell all their stored cotton to the state. Influenced by the leading role of Communist Party members and cooperative members, Li Laoshou, who had the most stored cotton in the village, deposited all 600 jin of his stored seed cotton into the cooperative. After Dong Yutang, the street leader of First Street, Zhentou Town, Shijiazhuang City Suburbs, reported 3,000 jin of stored cotton to the cooperative, cooperative members in the area successively reported their stored cotton; the cotton deposited by cooperative members into the cooperative quickly reached 4,320 jin. The cooperative members of First Street in the town then issued a cotton sales challenge to Third Street, which was immediately responded to; Wen Lao Ju, a military family member in her seventies from Third Street, was the first to report storing 30 jin of cotton.
    In Dingxian Special District, many village cadres and Communist Party members not only stored or sold their own stored cotton to the state, but also actively purchased cotton on behalf of the state, accelerating the cotton purchase work in the area. All the cadres and Communist Party members in Xichiyang Village, Dingxian County, went from door to door to conduct propaganda, mobilizing cotton farmers to participate in cotton sales competitions. As a result, the patriotic enthusiasm of the cotton farmers in the village greatly increased, and they actively sold their stored cotton to the state. Cotton farmer Xiao Laotou's family sold 500 jin of cotton to the cotton yarn and cloth company. Xiao Huiwen, the military dependents' committee member of the village, guaranteed to purchase 2,000 jin of cotton on behalf of the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company. Hu Xiaosan, a Communist Party member in the village, guaranteed to purchase 1,500 jin on behalf of the company. The Dingxian branch of the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company purchased more than 7,000 jin of cotton in Xichiyang Village within three days.
    In order to cooperate with the patriotic cotton sales and storage competition of cotton farmers, the cooperatives and state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies in Shijiazhuang Special District have established 260 cotton collection stations in various places, starting to purchase and store large quantities of cotton, while also supplying cotton farmers with daily necessities. The cotton purchase volume of the Yezhen Town collection station in Lecheng County on June 8 has exceeded three times the previous daily average cotton purchase volume. Under the unified leadership of the Fiscal and Economic Committee of the Dingxian Special Commissioner's Office, state-owned cotton yarn and cloth, department stores, and other companies in Dingxian Special District organized two working groups, bringing cloth, yarn, knitwear, coal, and soap to more than ten villages such as Xichiyang, Zhaicheng, and Dali in Dingxian County to cooperate with cotton purchases and supply cotton farmers.

　　石家庄专区召开爱国售棉动员大会
    四万党员合作社员拿出全部存棉
    定县专区党员干部售棉后并积极为国家代购棉花
    河北省石家庄专区和定县专区棉农现正热烈展开爱国主义的售棉储棉运动。
    石家庄专区已有三万一千个村庄的中共党员、青年团员和积极分子举行了爱国售棉的紧急动员大会。全专区已有四万六千多中共党员与合作社社员把自己的存棉全部卖给或存入了国家指定的经济机关。他们并向棉农进行售棉、储棉的宣传、动员工作，使得广大棉农认识了国家购棉的重要性。乐城县东羊市村中共党员李喜禄动员家里人把存棉全部卖给了国家。在中共党员、合作社员带头影响下，该村存棉最多的李老寿将所存六百斤籽棉全部存入了合作社。石家庄市郊区振头镇第一街在街长董玉堂自报存棉三千斤到合作社以后，该地社员都相继自报存棉；社员存入合作社的棉花迅速达到四千三百二十斤。该镇第一街社员又向第三街提出售棉挑战，并且立刻得到响应；三街七十多岁的军人家属温老局首先报存棉花三十斤。
    定县专区许多村干部和中共党员不但将自己存棉储存或卖给了国家，并且积极给国家代购棉花，加速了该地区的棉花收购工作。定县西坻羊村全体干部、中共党员挨门串户进行宣传，动员棉农进行卖棉竞赛。因而该村棉农爱国热情大为提高，纷纷将存棉卖给国家。棉农萧老头一户就卖棉五百斤给花纱布公司。该村军属委员萧惠文保证给国营花纱布公司代购棉花两千斤。该村中共党员胡小三保证代购一千五百斤。国营花纱布公司定县支公司三天内就在西坻羊村收购了棉花七千多斤。
    为了配合棉农爱国主义的售棉、储棉竞赛，石家庄专区合作社和国营花纱布公司在各地设立了二百六十个收棉站，开始大量收购与储存棉花，同时供应棉农以日用品。乐城县冶河镇收购站六月八日一天的购棉量，已经超过以往每日平均购棉量的三倍。定县专区国营花纱布、百货等公司，在该区专署财政经济委员会的统一领导下，组织了两个工作小组，带着布、纱、针织品、煤和肥皂等，到定县西坻羊、翟城和大力等十多个村，配合购棉，供应给棉农。
