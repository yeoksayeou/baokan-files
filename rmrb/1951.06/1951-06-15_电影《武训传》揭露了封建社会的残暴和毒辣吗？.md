　　Does the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" expose the brutality and venom of feudal society?

To the Editor:

　　Mr. Xiao Zou said: "The movie 'The Life of Wu Xun' profoundly, thoroughly, and completely exposes the brutality and venom of the feudal system." This statement is not in accordance with the facts. While the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" does portray the ferocious side of Zhang, the local 'Juren' (a successful candidate in the imperial examination at the provincial level), in oppressing the working people, it also praises feudal rulers such as Lou Junling, Yang Shufang, and Guo Fen. For example, when explaining why he wanted to help Wu Xun establish "free schools," Guo Fen said: "Zhang, the 'Juren', says Wu Qi is a madman, but Wu Qi endures hardship and accumulates money, not for himself! He wants to educate poor children and find ways for the farmers! We need more madmen and fools like him in this world!" And Mr. Sun Yu, the screenwriter and director of the movie, said in the script that this was "an impassioned and righteous cry, resounding like a great bell throughout the hall." This tells the audience that feudal rulers like Guo Fen also want "poor children" to "study." The poor people do not need to revolt, the rulers are also serving the poor. Isn't this a eulogy to the feudal system? The movie "The Life of Wu Xun" does not expose the crimes of the feudal rulers deeply or thoroughly enough; it only touches on some superficial phenomena of feudal society without revealing the class essence of feudal society. The author's theme is to praise Wu Xun, a lackey of the feudal class, therefore it is impossible to correctly dissect feudal society.

### 电影《武训传》揭露了封建社会的残暴和毒辣吗？

　　电影《武训传》揭露了封建社会的残暴和毒辣吗？编辑同志：
    萧奏先生说：“电影《武训传》深刻地、彻底地、全部地揭露了封建制度的残暴和毒辣。”这种说法是不合乎事实的。电影《武训传》固然也表现了张举人欺压劳动人民的凶恶面貌；但却又歌颂了娄峻岭、杨树芳、郭芬等封建统治者。如郭芬在说明为什么要帮助武训办“义学”时说：“张举人说武七是疯子，可是武七吃苦积钱，决不是为了他自己！他是要为穷孩子们念书，给庄稼人想办法呀！像他这样的疯子，骗子，咱们这个世界上还嫌太少哪！”而电影的编导者孙瑜先生在剧本里说，这是“激昂正气的呼声，像黄钟大吕响彻了大厅。”这就告诉观众：像郭芬那样的封建统治者也是要使“穷孩子”们“念书”的。穷人们不要闹革命，统治者也是在为穷人们服务的。这难道还不是对封建制度的歌颂吗？电影《武训传》揭露封建统治者的罪恶极不深刻，也不彻底；它只涉及到了一些封建社会的表面现象，而没有揭露出封建社会的阶级本质。作者的主题，是歌颂武训这个封建阶级的奴才，因此就不可能正确解剖封建社会。
