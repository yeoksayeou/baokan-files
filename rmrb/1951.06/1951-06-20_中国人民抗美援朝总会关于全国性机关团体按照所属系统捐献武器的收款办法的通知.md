　　Notice from the General Association of Chinese People to Resist America and Aid Korea Regarding Collection Methods for National Agencies and Organizations to Donate Weapons According to Their Affiliated Systems

　　Since the Association issued the call for weapon donations on June 1st, many national agencies and organizations have responded by urging their affiliated organizations to make donations. Some units have even instructed their affiliated organizations to send donations directly to central-level agencies, causing inconvenience for local areas in terms of donation payment and statistics. In order to resolve this difficulty, after consultation with relevant agencies and organizations, the following is stipulated: In the future, if local organizations of each system need to directly remit the funds donated by their affiliated system to their superiors, they can submit the donation to the local People's Bank, obtain a receipt, and then submit the receipt to their affiliated superior organization. Finally, the central leading organs of each unit, based on the total amount of donations from their affiliated organizations, will consult with the Association to determine the type, number, or naming of the donated weapons. This provides convenience for local areas to pay donations and does not hinder the unified donation movement of national agencies and organizations. It can be described as mutually beneficial, and it is requested that it be followed immediately.

　　中国人民抗美援朝总会        
    关于全国性机关团体按照所属系统捐献武器的收款办法的通知
    自本会六月一日发出捐献武器的号召后，许多全国性的机关、团体即纷纷号召其所属组织进行捐献。并有个别单位通知所属组织，将捐款直接送到中央一级机关，各地对捐款之缴纳和统计，因此颇感不便。兹为解决此项困难，经与各有关机关、团体协商后，规定今后各系统的地方组织，按其所属系统所捐之款项如须直接解缴其上级时，可将捐款送交当地人民银行，换取收据，然后将收据送交其所属之上级组织，最后由各单位中央领导机关，根据所属组织捐款总数，与本会商定所捐武器的种类，数目或命名。这样既给各地缴纳捐款以便利，又不妨害各全国性的机关、团体之统一捐献运动，可称两便，请即遵照执行。
