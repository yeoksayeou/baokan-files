To the Editor:

Since the patriotic education campaign for resisting America and aiding Korea, there has been significant progress in tax collection work in the Fifth District of Beijing. The most prominent achievement is the elimination of tax arrears among stallholders in Dongdan Market. In the past, tax arrears were a serious problem for Dongdan stallholders. Starting in April, they devised a method of saving for taxes and paying through bank transfers: each stallholder set aside a portion of their daily sales revenue, which was collected by the group leader and deposited in the bank. By the end of the month, before the tax bureau issued notices, the tax money was already prepared. As a result, none of the 114 households in the market had any arrears. Moreover, 44 of them cleared all their accumulated arrears, which they had consistently failed to pay monthly. This is a complete turnaround from the past.

Previously, the dozens of cadres at the Fifth District Tax Bureau spent most of their time on tax collection, especially those responsible for Dongdan Market. They were busy collecting taxes every day, but only about 20 percent of the total taxes due were collected on time each month.

In March of this year, when patriotic industrialists and merchants throughout the district and city were swept up in a wave of collective tax payment, Dongdan Market remained unmoved. Therefore, when higher authorities called for a change in this situation, most cadres believed it was impossible, saying, "It's easy to handle things on the streets, but difficult with small-scale vendors." Later, the higher-level tax authorities assigned cadres to study documents on resisting America and aiding Korea, as well as the experiences of collective tax payment in other regions. At the same time, they mobilized everyone to formulate patriotic pledges in connection with their own work. This addressed the erroneous ideas held by some tax cadres, such as fear of difficulties and the feeling that "resisting America and aiding Korea is a matter for the front lines in Korea," and strengthened their confidence and enthusiasm in their work.

Through patriotic education, stallholders recalled the oppression they suffered under the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang. They realized that timely payment of taxes to the People's Government was a practical action for industrialists and merchants to resist America and aid Korea. After discussion and research, they proposed this method of collective saving for tax payment. Everyone pledged to save every month, strive to be models, and strive to permanently eliminate tax arrears.

In the past, tax officials had a vague understanding of relying on mass organizations and activists to improve their work, believing that some group leaders "took the lead in defaulting" and "could not be relied upon." However, after the education campaign for resisting America and aiding Korea, the group leaders took the initiative to come up with solutions, made guarantees, and actively mobilized their respective group members. For example, when the idea of saving for tax payment was first being considered, some were afraid of the added trouble of procedures, some were worried about a shortage of spare cash and difficulties in turnover, and some pointed out that their daily sales of two or three thousand yuan were too small for the bank to accept. The group leaders immediately appointed representatives to negotiate with the bank, and the bank agreed to accept payments made by the market representative on account every day, even for amounts of two or three thousand. Next, groups with more activists began to trial the method. At the end of the month, they sent the deposit books and the tax bureau's notices to the bank for transfer, making the process simple and convenient, and earning interest on the deposits (for some households, the interest on the deposits was enough to offset the stamp duty). In this way, starting in April, the method of collective saving for tax payment was fully implemented in the market.

### 北京东单菜市摊贩  集体储蓄缴纳税款

　　北京东单菜市摊贩
    集体储蓄缴纳税款编辑同志：
    自进行了抗美援朝爱国教育后，北京市第五区的税收工作有很显著的进步。其中最突出的是东单菜市的摊贩户的滞纳税款现象已经消除。过去，东单摊贩滞纳税款现象是严重的。从四月份起，他们自己想出了储蓄税款，银行转账缴纳的办法：即各摊贩户每天从卖货款中抽出一部分钱来，由小组长收齐存到银行里去，月底在税局发下通知之前，税款就早已准备好了。这样，全市场一百一十四户再没有一个滞纳的。而且，其中还有四十四户把月月滞纳的全部积欠都缴清了。这同过去的情况完全不同了。
    过去五区税务分局的几十个干部，大部分时间都耗费在催税工作上，尤其是负责东单菜市的同志，他们每天忙于收税工作，而每月如期收到的税款只占总数的百分之二十。
    今年三月，全区以及全市的爱国工商业者都卷入了集体纳税的热潮，东单菜市场还是没有一点动静。因此，当上级提出改变这一情况时，干部们大都认为是不可能的事，他们说“大街上好办，菜贩小户难办。”后来，上级税务机关向干部们布置了抗美援朝文件和各地集体纳税情况和经验的学习，同时动员大家结合本身业务，订立了爱国公约，解决了一部分税收干部中怕困难及觉得“抗美援朝是朝鲜前线的事”等错误思想，增强了工作信心和热情。
    经过爱国主义的教育，摊贩们都回想起在日伪及国民党时所受的压迫，认识到及时向人民政府缴纳应纳的税款，正是工商业者抗美援朝的实际行动。经过他们的研究讨论，大家就提出了这个集体储蓄纳税办法。大家都保证要月月储蓄，争取模范，争取永远消灭滞纳现象。
    过去税务工作同志在依靠群众组织及积极分子来搞好工作的思想是模糊的，认为有些小组长“带头滞纳”，“依靠不得”。但经过抗美援朝的教育后，组长们都能主动地想出了办法，提出了保证，积极地动员各自的组员。如才开始酝酿储蓄纳税时，有的怕手续多添麻烦，有的怕手头零钱短少，周转困难，有的提出买卖小每天两三千元怕银行不收。组长们即推出代表和银行协商，每天由市场代表按摺子交款，二千、三千都收。接着积极分子较多的组就试行起来了。他们在月底把摺子和税局的通知一齐送到银行转账，手续又简便，存款期间又有利息（有些户，存款利息可足抵印花税）。这样，从四月份起，集体储蓄纳税的办法就在菜市场全面地展开了。
