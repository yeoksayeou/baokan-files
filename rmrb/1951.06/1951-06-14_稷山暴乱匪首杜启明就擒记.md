　　Record of the Capture of Du Qiming, Ring Leader of the Jishan Riot
　　By our special correspondent Shi Jiyan

　　　　About the Jishan Riot
　　In November 1950, an armed riot occurred in Jishan County, Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province. More than one hundred political bandits from the 13th Detachment of the "China National Volunteer Army Yuncheng Prefecture Headquarters," a counter-revolutionary armed organization, attacked Jishan County seat and the Fifth District government, killing ten of our cadres and civilians, and looting some public funds and grain. The bandits also robbed militia of their guns along the way, coerced farmers to join, and posted reactionary notices. After the bandit unit was repelled by the Jishan County Public Security Forces, it fled to the Xiangning Mountains near Jishan, attempting to occupy it for a long time. The Jishan riot awakened the local military and civilians from their complacency. In accordance with the provincial leadership's policy of "resolutely suppressing, strictly cracking down, focusing on encirclement and suppression and investigation, and supplemented by political disintegration," they immediately pursued and suppressed the bandit unit. In two or three days, the bandits who had fled to the Xiangning Mountains were completely defeated. Later, most of the fleeing bandits were captured one after another, and the entire provincial organization of the pseudo "China National Volunteer Army" was completely cracked. As of early May of this year, a total of 647 bandits have been captured, including 58 important bandit leaders such as the bandit commander-in-chief, district commanders-in-chief, column leaders, and detachment leaders. Several bandit leaders were captured from the three provinces of Chahar, Shaanxi, and Hebei. The People's Government has punished the bandits according to the severity of their crimes, with penalties ranging from execution and imprisonment to control.

　　　　The Story of How Bandit Du Qiming Was Caught
　　After the Jishan riot, bandit Du Qiming, the "Commander-in-Chief of the China National Volunteer Army Yuncheng Prefecture," fled to Quwo County overnight and hid in the home of his accomplice, bandit Jie Yuesheng. In Quwo, bandit Du continued to develop counter-revolutionary armed organizations, appointing bandit Jie Yuesheng as the captain of the "Fifth Reconnaissance Column" and Gao Jicai and Fan Chongshan as the battalion commanders of the bandit "Guard Battalion." In February of this year, Shanxi Province continued to carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries. Bandit Du felt that it was difficult to survive in Quwo, so he and bandit Jie Yuesheng fled to Yishi County, disguised as hunters, hunting in the Yishi Mountains. A month later, bandit Du was afraid of arousing suspicion among the local people, so he returned to Quwo for the second time. Jie Yuesheng introduced him to live in Li Donglai's house in Zhangshao Village, changed his name, and covered up by doing odd jobs, attempting to lie low for a long time. In late March, when bandit Du heard the news that the county's Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea work team was going to the countryside, he felt "nervous" and very uneasy. According to bandit Du's confession after his arrest: "When the work team goes to the countryside, they will mobilize the masses to vigorously resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Everyone in the village said: 'Fight the American army in the front, dig out the American roots in the rear.' As soon as the work team arrives, they will go to each house to do propaganda, and the militia will check household registrations at night. In this way, they might dig me out." Therefore, bandit Du left Zhangshao Village on March 30 and fled to Yishi for the second time. After bandit Du arrived in Yishi, he went to Shen Village through the relationship of another bandit. At this time, the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement was also being launched in Yishi. The person in Shen Village who he had a relationship with dared not keep bandit Du, so he introduced him to Beishunwu Village in Anyi County. They were also carrying out the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea movement there, and he felt it was not very safe, so he went to Yishi County for the third time. At this time, Yishi was vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries. The regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries reached the countryside, and the masses everywhere accused counter-revolutionaries of their crimes. Bandit Du was so frightened that he did not dare to go out of the door for more than half a month. He could not eat or sleep, and he was terrified when he heard dogs barking. At this time, the person protecting bandit Du was also very scared and wanted bandit Du to flee to Hexi (Shaanxi). However, in bandit Du's view, the whole of China was resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, so it would not work to run to Hexi. Because he had more reactionary connections in Quwo, bandit Du returned to Quwo for the third time.
　　On May 7, bandit Du returned to Quwo. When passing through Dongzhen in Wenxi County, it was just getting dark, and the village was holding a mass meeting. A female staff member was propagandizing to the masses about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. She said: "Counter-revolutionaries are the running dogs of imperialism. Everyone knows Xu Fengjun of Beicun, Wenxi! He was with Du Qiming, the bandit leader of the Jishan riot. Now the People's Government has caught him and brought him to justice. Although bandit Du Qiming has run away, no matter where he runs, the people will catch him back..." Bandit Du Qiming heard these words below and broke out in a cold sweat all over his body. On May 8, bandit Du rushed to Zhangshao Village in Quwo. After inquiring, he found that the county's work team was also stationed in Zhangshao Village. At this time, bandit Du was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. He really had no way to go to heaven and no way to go to earth. At nine o'clock that night, Liang Xicheng, the secretary of the Zhangshao Village branch of the Communist Party of China, heard the news that bandit Du had come to the village for the second time, and led the militia to arrest bandit Du and take him to the Quwo County Government overnight. This bandit, who had escaped for half a year, finally did not escape the giant palm of the people!

　　　　The People's Net of Justice, Impossible to Escape
　　The facts of the capture of the bandits in the Jishan riot, especially the facts of the capture of bandit Du Qiming, prove that no matter where the counter-revolutionaries escape, they cannot escape the people's net of justice. It proves the unparalleled power of the unified national action to suppress counter-revolutionaries. It also proves that the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries in Shanxi Province has become a household name and is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.
　　Take the Yuncheng area as an example: Since the Jishan riot, the people of the Yuncheng area have responded to the government's call and generally assisted the government in capturing the fleeing and lurking bandits, capturing a total of 578 people. Without the assistance of the people, it is hard to imagine capturing so many bandits. If the people did not have the foundation of political education in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, they would not be so actively assisting the government in capturing counter-revolutionaries.
　　Bandit Du Qiming's confession after his arrest can further prove this point. Bandit Du said: "The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries is really frightening! All I heard was resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and all I saw was resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and vigorously suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Everyone seemed to be pointing at me and saying: 'You, I recognize you, you are the bandit of the Jishan riot, you are a counter-revolutionary.' It made me look dazed, sleep uneasy, and have no way to go."

　　稷山暴乱匪首杜启明就擒记
    本报特约记者　史纪言
            从稷山暴乱说起
    一九五○年十一月，山西省运城专区稷山县发生了武装暴乱案。反革命武装组织“中国国民志愿军运城区总指挥部”第十三支队政治土匪一百余人，袭击我稷山县城及五区区政府，杀死我干部、群众共十人，抢去公款、公粮一部；匪徒沿途并劫夺民兵枪支，胁迫农民参加，张贴反动布告。该匪部被我稷山县公安部队击退后，即窜往稷山附近的乡宁山，企图长期盘踞。稷山暴乱事件把当地军民从麻痹思想中震醒了。他们遵照省领导机关的“坚决扑灭、严厉镇压，围剿侦破为主，政治瓦解为辅”的方针，立即追剿该匪部。两三天工夫，即将窜往乡宁山的匪徒全部击溃。以后陆续将逃散匪徒大部捕获，并将伪“中国国民志愿军”全省组织完全破获。截至今年五月初，计捕获匪徒六百四十七人，其中有匪总指挥、各区总指挥、纵队长、支队长等重要匪首五十八人。有几个匪首是从察哈尔、陕西、河北三省捕回来的。人民政府已根据匪徒罪恶大小，分别予以枪决、判徒刑、或管制的惩罚。
            杜匪启明落网经过
    稷山暴乱案发生后，“中国国民志愿军运城区总指挥”杜匪启明连夜逃到曲沃县，藏到他的同伙解匪月升家中。在曲沃，杜匪继续发展反革命武装组织，委任解匪月升为“侦察第五纵队”队长，高冀才、范崇善为匪“警卫营”营长。今年二月，山西全省抗美援朝及镇压反革命运动继续开展，杜匪感到在曲沃不好存身，便偕同解匪月升，跑到猗氏县，化装猎人，在猗氏山中打猎。一个月后，杜匪恐怕引起当地人民的怀疑，便二次返回曲沃，由解匪月升介绍他到张少村李东来家居住，改名换姓，以打短工作掩护，企图长期潜伏。三月下旬，杜匪听到县府抗美援朝工作组下乡的消息时，感到“空气紧张”，十分不安。据杜匪被捕后供称：“工作组下乡便要发动群众大闹抗美援朝。村上都说：‘前方打美军，后方挖美根’。工作组一到，就要到各家宣传，夜里民兵要查户口，这样，说不定会把我挖出来。”因此，杜匪于三月三十日离开了张少村，二次跑到猗氏。杜匪到了猗氏，又通过另一个匪徒的关系到了申村。这时候，猗氏抗美援朝运动也正展开，申村关系人不敢留住杜匪，便把他介绍到安邑县的北顺武村。那里也正在搞抗美援朝，他感到不大保险，三次到了猗氏县。这时候，猗氏已经在大张旗鼓镇压反革命了。惩治反革命条例到了农村，群众到处控诉反革命罪恶，吓得杜匪半个多月没有敢出大门一步，吃不下饭，睡不着觉，听见狗吠就胆战心惊。这时，掩护杜匪的人也十分害怕，要杜匪逃往河西（陕西）。但是，在杜匪看来，全中国都在抗美援朝，都在镇压反革命，跑到河西也不行。由于在曲沃反动关系较多，杜匪又三次返回曲沃。
    五月七日，杜匪返回曲沃。路过闻喜县东镇时，天刚落黑，村上正开群众大会。一个女工作人员向群众宣传抗美援朝、镇压反革命，她说：“反革命分子就是帝国主义的走狗，大家都知道闻喜北村的续峰峻吧！他就是和稷山暴乱的土匪头子杜启明一起的。现在人民政府已把他抓住法办了。杜匪启明虽然跑了，可是无论他跑到那里，人民也要把他抓回来的……”杜匪启明在下边听见这些话，混身直出冷汗。五月八日，杜匪赶到曲沃张少村，一打听，张少村也住有县上的工作组。杜匪这时好像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，焦急万分，真是上天无路，入地无门。当天晚上九点钟，中国共产党张少村支部书记梁喜成听到杜匪二次来村的消息，带领民兵把杜匪捉住，连夜解往曲沃县政府。这个漏网半年的匪徒，终未逃出人民的巨掌！
            人民法网，插翅难逃
    从稷山暴乱匪徒的就擒的事实中，特别从杜匪启明落网的事实中，证明了反革命分子无论逃到什么地方，也逃不出人民的法网。证明了全国镇压反革命统一行动的无比威力。也证明了山西省抗美援朝运动和镇压反革命运动，已经家喻户晓，深入人心。
    试以运城地区为例：自从稷山暴乱事件发生后，运城地区人民响应政府号召，普遍协助政府捉拿逃散潜伏的匪徒，共捉拿了五百七十八名。没有人民群众的协助，捉拿这么多的匪徒，是很难想像的。人民群众如果没有抗美援朝和镇压反革命政治教育的基础，也不会这样积极协助政府捉拿反革命分子。
    杜匪启明被捕后的供词，更可以证明这个道理。杜匪说：“抗美援朝、镇压反革命这个运动，真是吓死人！所听到的都是抗美援朝、大张旗鼓镇压反革命，所见到的都是抗美援朝、大张旗鼓镇压反革命。每一个人好像都在指着我说：‘你，我认得你，你就是稷山暴乱的土匪，你是反革命。’闹得我神色恍惚，睡卧不安，走头无路。”
