To the Editor:
    On May 13th, I saw a peep show at the temple fair in Zhanshan Temple, Zhanshan Village, Qingdao City. A large crowd of spectators, including many children, surrounded it. With curiosity, I also went to take a look, wanting to see the new changes in peep shows after liberation. But on the contrary, what I saw was not new content, but several extremely bad pictures. One picture was of the Zhili-Fengtian War, with the "red, yellow, blue, white, and black" "national flag" inserted on it; another picture showed a warship on fire, but the picture was already blurred, and it was impossible to tell what war it was. The peep show operator said it was something like "Burning Japan" and "Heaven and Earth Collapsing"; there was a landscape painting of Qianmen in Beijing, depicting tables and chairs placed in front of Qianmen, with several women in Qing dynasty clothing sitting around, giving alluring glances to a man pulling a donkey standing next to them; in the landscape painting of the "Old Tianjin Concession," the ferocious appearance of imperialists running rampant in China appeared... What I saw were these pictures containing the toxic elements of spreading feudal and imperialist thought.
    Today, what flies in the sky above our motherland is no longer the "Five-Color Flag" and the "Blue Sky with a White Sun" flag, but the great Five-Starred Red Flag; there are no longer any concessions in Tianjin and all the territories of the motherland, and the era of imperialists running rampant in China has become a thing of the past. However, peep shows, as one of the propaganda tools for conducting ideological education among the masses, are still promoting such harmful thoughts. I think this should attract the attention of relevant cultural authorities, and they should not abandon leadership over them, but should actively educate and transform them so that they can promote the cause of resisting America and aiding Korea and other mass movements.

### 反对传播封建与帝国主义思想的洋片

    反对传播封建与帝国主义思想的洋片编辑同志：
    五月十三日，我在青岛市湛山村湛山寺的庙会上，看到有个玩洋片的，那里围了一大群观众，其中有不少是小孩子。我怀着好奇的心情也去看了一下，想看一看解放后洋片的新变化。但恰相反，我看到的不是新内容，而是几幅极其恶劣的画片。一幅是直奉战争时的画片，上面插着“红黄蓝白黑”的“国旗”；一幅是画着一只军舰起火，但画面已经模糊，看不出是什么战争，玩洋片的说是什么“火烧日本国”“天塌地陷”；有一片北京前门的风景画，画着前门前边摆着桌椅，周围坐着几个身穿满清服饰的女人，正向站在她们旁边的一个拉毛驴的男人投媚眼；在“天津旧租界”的风景画里，出现了帝国主义者在中国横行无忌的凶恶相，……我所看到的就是这些含有传播封建和帝国主义思想毒素的画片。
    今天在我们祖国的上空飘扬的不再是“五色旗”和“青天白日”旗，而是伟大的五星红旗了；在天津和祖国所有的领土上，已经再没有什么租界了，帝国主义在中国横行的时代已经成为过去，而洋片作为向群众进行思想教育的宣传工具之一，还宣传这种有毒害的思想，我觉得应引起有关文化机关的重视，不应对他们放弃领导，应积极地教育改造他们，使他们能为抗美援朝及其他各种群众运动而宣传。
