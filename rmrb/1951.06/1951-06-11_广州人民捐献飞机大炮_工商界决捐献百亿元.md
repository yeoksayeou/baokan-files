　　Guangzhou People Donate Airplanes and Artillery

    Business and Industry Decide to Donate 10 Billion Yuan
    The people of all circles in Guangzhou have launched a vigorous campaign to donate airplanes and artillery. As of June 8th, the people of all circles in the city have initially initiated the donation of several airplanes, including "Guangzhou Worker," "Guangzhou Woman," "Guangzhou Student," "Guangdong Student," and "Guangdong Bank." The Guangzhou Farmers' Association has also decided to mobilize the 180,000 liberated farmers in the suburbs who have victoriously completed land reform to strive to donate an airplane. More than 400 representatives from over 150 industries in Guangzhou's business and industrial sectors gathered on June 8th. At the meeting, they unanimously decided that the business and industrial sectors would donate 10 billion yuan to purchase airplanes.

    The people of all circles in Guangzhou are in high spirits during the donation campaign. After hearing the call from the Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee that "Whatever the Volunteer Army needs, we should dedicate to them," the employees of the Guangzhou Electricity Management Office immediately donated more than 15 million yuan. Many production teams in the office are studying ways to increase production and practice economy in order to make long-term donations. In addition to donating over 9 million yuan, many boat people in the Pearl River District also donated all the cash given to each boat by the Dragon Boat Festival Wharf Welfare Association for pork and other gifts this year. The cash donated by the staff of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government has reached 100 million yuan. The teachers and students of the Guangzhou Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School donated more than 16 million yuan at a conference. The teachers and students of Zhujiang Middle School donated 8.87 million yuan. Members of the Guangzhou branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association donated 43.5 million yuan at a conference. The twelve Chinese students who recently returned to Guangzhou from the United States also jointly donated 2 million yuan. During the donation campaign held by the people of Yuexiu District in Guangzhou on the 7th, Li Jueping, a housewife from Haiguang Street, took off her mother's heirloom – a gold bracelet – from her arm and donated it on the spot to purchase airplanes. Zhang Yuan, a 78-year-old woman, also donated her only savings of 100,000 yuan and wrote a letter to the Southern Daily, requesting all sisters in the city to do their best to donate money to purchase airplanes and artillery, support the front lines, and strive for greater victory.
