Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: Tokyo dispatch: The United States' conspiracy to rearm Japan is being intensified. According to news in newspapers such as the Japan Industrial Economic News: The "U.S.-Japan Joint Military Committee," decided upon by Dulles and Japanese reactionaries in April to be responsible for carrying out U.S.-Japan "military cooperation" and rearming Japan, is being prepared for establishment. The committee will be composed of five to seven members from both the U.S. and Japan. Currently, Shigeru Yoshida is personally selecting the committee members. Former Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura (former Foreign Minister, ambassador to the United States during the Pearl Harbor Incident) will participate as a diplomat. The committee has decided to establish budget, operations, and mobilization subcommittees. The Japanese side is expected to be staffed by former military personnel. The selection of subcommittee members will be centered on Takushiro Hattori, the current director of the Demobilization Bureau's data compilation department, and will be carried out jointly with a group of former Japanese military staff officers who were originally compiling MacArthur's "History of the Pacific War." The Japanese reactionary government is also planning to establish a "Public Security Agency" as a disguised Ministry of Defense, with its personnel filled by former army and navy personnel from the current Demobilization Bureau.

Willoughby, an important accomplice of the warmonger MacArthur, the chief of the Second Section of the General Staff of the U.S. Occupation Forces in Japan, and the head of the secret service, before being dismissed and leaving Japan recently, summoned fascist military figures such as Sadae Shimomura (former General, Commander of the North China Expeditionary Army, Army Minister of the Higashikuni Cabinet), and Koshiro Kawabe (former Lieutenant General, Vice Chief of the Army General Staff), to collect opinions on rearming Japan. Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the heads of various factions of the former Japanese military have been actively engaged recently, dreaming of rebuilding the so-called "Japanese Imperial Army and Navy." According to the Japan Weekly Report: the army has been formed by Shimomura Sadae, Kawabe Koshiro and others to form a joint "Eight-Man Committee", which has become the core of rearming Japan. The old navy, led by Kichisaburo Nomura and Yasuji Watanabe (current director of the Technical Headquarters of the Maritime Safety Agency), is planning to restore the Japanese Navy. Ten percent of the 1.2 million Japanese fishing boat crew members are naval personnel, "excellent technicians and commanders are still alive, so the navy does not need to adopt conscription, and the reconstruction of the Japanese navy based on the voluntary system can be done with 50,000 people."

Xinhua News Agency, June 19th: Tokyo dispatch: According to materials from the Economic Stabilization Board and the Foreign Ministry Investigation Bureau of the Japanese Yoshida reactionary government, the Yoshida government has passed a resolution to fully serve as an accomplice to the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea. The materials point out that the various resolutions passed by the Japanese Cabinet to comprehensively assist the U.S. military's aggression against Korea are: supplying military materials; recruiting laborers for the United States; Japanese private enterprises accepting U.S. military orders; and using former Japanese state-owned factories to repair U.S. tanks, airplanes, artillery, tractors, and landing craft, etc. According to the Asahi Shimbun on March 9th of this year: the Ministry of Finance, the Economic Stabilization Board, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have submitted a specific plan for "Japan-U.S. economic cooperation" to the U.S. General Headquarters; U.S. officials also publicly admitted on March 10th that "in order for Japan to manufacture necessary military supplies, it is planned to supply Japan with strategic raw materials" (United Press). In fact, since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, Japan has directly supplied military supplies to the U.S. military, and various monopoly enterprises have also produced goods for the U.S. military's orders. The U.S. military has also used Japan's former state-owned arsenals to manufacture and repair tanks, airplanes, artillery, tractors, landing craft, submarines, and oil tankers. These Japanese arsenals include the former army's Sagami Arsenal, Iwakuni Fuel Plant, Army Ordnance Factory, First Army Arsenal, as well as the former navy's arsenals in Kure, Ominato, Maizuru, Sasebo and other places. To this end, the Yoshida government decided as early as last September to suspend the dismantling of a series of factories originally designated as reparations, so that they could manufacture weapons of murder for the U.S. military. According to Kyodo News on May 10th, the total value of U.S. military "special procurement" orders obtained by Japan will reach 400 million U.S. dollars by the end of June; this amount is equivalent to 49.3 percent of Japan's total export trade last year.

Japan also provides a large amount of "labor" manpower for the U.S. military. According to various reports, the total number of Japanese people participating in the U.S. military's naval, mine-sweeping and other battlefield duties or rear bases and logistics duties is at least 150,000 to 200,000. In addition, in terms of transportation, in April alone, the U.S. military occupied 36.3 percent of large seagoing vessels; 40 percent of the state-owned railway's freight cars were also occupied by the U.S. military. Japan's entire industrial activity and transportation artery are controlled by the U.S. military.

　　美国重新武装日本阴谋活动加紧        
    美日反动派筹设武装日本机构        
    吉田反动政府竟全力充当侵朝美军帮凶
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：美国重新武装日本的阴谋活动，正在加紧进行中。据日本产业经济新闻等报刊所载消息：杜勒斯与日本反动派于四月间商谈所决定的负责进行美日“军事合作”与重新武装日本的机构——“美日联合军事委员会”正在筹备成立。该会将由美日各出委员五至七名组成，目前吉田茂正在亲自从事委员之遴选工作。前海军上将野村吉三郎（曾任外相，珍珠港事变时任驻美大使）将以外交官资格参加。该委员会决定设立预算、作战、动员等分组委员会，日本方面预定均由旧军人充任。遴选分组委员的工作，将以现任复员局资料整理部长服部卓四郎为中心，与原为麦克阿瑟编纂“太平洋战史”的一批旧日军参谋共同进行。日本反动政府并计划成立“治安省”，作为变相的国防部，其人员即以现在复员局之旧陆海军人充任。
    战争贩子麦克阿瑟的重要帮凶、美国驻日占领军总部参谋部第二处处长、特务头子威洛贝，在最近解职离日之前，曾召集法西斯军人下村定（前上将、华北派遣军司令、东久迩内阁陆军大臣）、河边虎四郎（前中将、陆军参谋本部次官）等，收集关于重新武装日本的意见。日本旧军人各派系的头目，在美帝国主义指使之下，最近积极活动，梦想重建所谓“日本帝国陆海军”。又据日本周报载称：陆军方面已由下村定、河边虎四郎等组成各派联合的“八人委员会”，成为重新武装日本的核心。旧海军以野村吉三郎、渡边安次（现任海上保安厅技术本部长）两派，计划恢复日本海军。现在日本一百二十万渔船船员中有百分之十为海军人员，“优秀之技术人员及指挥人员亦均健在，故海军不必采取征兵制，依志愿制度重建日本海军，有五万人即可敷用”。
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：根据日本吉田反动政府经济安定本部与外务省调查局的材料，吉田政府曾通过决议，全力充当美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争的帮凶。该项材料指出：日本内阁所通过的各项全面帮助侵朝美军的决议是：供给军用物资；替美国征募劳工；日本私人企业接受美国军事订货以及利用前日本国营工厂修理美国的坦克、飞机、大炮、牵引车和登陆艇等等。据本年三月九日朝日新闻载称：大藏省、经济安定本部和通商产业省已向美军总司令部提出“日美经济协力”的具体方案；美国官方于三月十日亦公开承认，“为使日本制造必要的军需物资，计划供给日本战略原料”（合众社）。实际上，自美国发动侵朝战争以来，日本即已直接为美军供应军需物资，各独占企业亦已为美军订货而生产，美军更利用日本以前各国营兵工厂从事制造和修理坦克、飞机、大炮、牵引车、登陆艇、潜水艇和油船。这些日本兵工厂中包括前陆军的相模造兵厂、岩国燃料厂、陆军火药厂、第一陆军造兵厂，以及前海军在吴港、大凑、舞鹤、佐世保等处的兵工厂。吉田政府为此早于去年九月即决定中止拆卸原来规定作为赔偿的一系列的工厂，使其为美军制造杀人武器。据五月十日共同社消息，日本所得美军“特需”订货的总值，到六月底止，将达四亿美元；此数相当于去年日本出口贸易总额的百分之四十九点三。
    日本并为美军供给大量的“劳务”人力。据各方报道，参加美军航海、扫雷等战地勤务或后方基地、兵站勤务的日本人，总数至少有十五万到二十万人。此外，在交通运输方面，仅今年四月，侵朝美军即占用了大型航海船只百分之三十六点三；国营铁道的货车也被美军占用了百分之四十。日本全部产业活动及交通动脉，都为美军所控制。
