　　Many Readers of This Newspaper Suggest
　　Bringing Bandit Zhang Quanbao to Yunzhou West Village
　　And Executing Him in Front of Comrade Liu Hulan's Tomb
    Editor's Note: On June 5th, this newspaper published the news that the Wanquan County People's Government of Shanxi Province had captured the murderer Zhang Quanbao, who killed Liu Hulan. Readers have sent letters one after another, requesting that the bandit Zhang be escorted to Comrade Hulan's hometown and executed in a mass rally in front of her tomb. Now we are publishing three selected letters.
        (I) Comrade Editor:
    When our reading group read the news that the murderer Zhang Quanbao, who killed Comrade Liu Hulan, had been captured by the government, all members of our reading group were extremely happy. Everyone unanimously requested the government to escort bandit Zhang Quanbao to Yunzhou West Village after the trial, hold a mass rally in front of Comrade Liu Hulan's tomb, and execute him on the spot.
    The capture of bandit Zhang Quanbao shows the power of the people. No matter where the counter-revolutionary elements hide, they will never escape the palm of the people, and one day they will be judged by the people.
    Each member of our reading group has proposed to learn from Comrade Liu Hulan's spirit of infinite loyalty to the revolution, and to guarantee to do a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea with practical actions of increasing production and donating weapons.

            (II) Comrade Editor:
    In 1949, I worked in the Cultural Troupe of the Former Central China Region Railway Garrison Headquarters. At that time, the Cultural Troupe rehearsed the opera "Liu Hulan." Comrades felt infinite grief during the rehearsal; especially when rehearsing the scene of Comrade Liu Hulan's heroic sacrifice, the comrades participating in the rehearsal were all in tears. At that time, we proposed to turn grief into strength, work actively, liberate all of China as soon as possible, and avenge Comrade Liu Hulan!
    On June 5th, I saw in the newspaper the news that the murderer Zhang Quanbao, who killed Comrade Liu Hulan, had been captured by the Wanquan County People's Government of Shanxi Province, and I was so happy that I couldn't speak. I suggest that the Wanquan County People's Government of Shanxi Province escort bandit Zhang Quanbao to Comrade Liu Hulan's tomb and execute him.

        (III) Chairman Pei Lisheng of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government: Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China:
    Recently, we saw the news in the newspaper that the murderer Zhang Quanbao, who killed Comrade Liu Hulan, had been captured, and we all jumped up with joy.
    The opera "Liu Hulan" has been performed in our county's rural areas, which has greatly educated the vast number of party members and cadres in our county. Some cadres who were previously passive in their work became active in their work after watching the opera "Liu Hulan." The vast number of cadres in our county have put forward the slogan of learning from Comrade Liu Hulan, and resolutely avenge Comrade Liu Hulan with practical actions of actively working and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Today, the murderer Zhang Quanbao, who killed Comrade Liu Hulan, has finally been captured, and the day to avenge Liu Hulan has arrived.
    We suggest to you: After you interrogate bandit Zhang Quanbao, you must escort the criminal to Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, for execution. The counter-revolutionary elements owe the people a blood debt there, so we will make him repay it there.

　　本报很多读者来信建议        
    把张匪全宝押到云周西村   
    在刘胡兰同志的墓前处决
    编者按：六月五日本报发表了山西省万泉县人民政府捕获杀害刘胡兰的凶犯张匪全宝的新闻后，读者纷纷来信，要求把张匪押到胡兰同志的故乡去枪毙。现在把来信选登三封。
        （一）编辑同志：
    当我们读报组读到杀害刘胡兰同志的凶犯张匪全宝被政府捕获的新闻时，我们全体读报组员万分高兴。大伙一致要求政府把张匪全宝审讯终结后，押到云周西村，在刘胡兰同志墓前召开群众大会，当场处决。
    张匪全宝的落网，显示了人民力量的强大。不管反革命分子隐藏在何处，决逃不出人民的手掌，终有一天会受到人民的裁判。
    我们读报组每个组员都提出要学习刘胡兰同志对革命无限忠诚的精神，保证要以增加生产、捐献武器的实际行动，来做好抗美援朝工作。
                                 东北铁路局机电工程队  魏文典
            （二）编辑同志：
    一九四九年，我在前华中区铁路警备司令部文工团工作。文工团当时曾排演歌剧“刘胡兰”。同志们在排戏时，都感到无限的悲痛；尤其当排到刘胡兰同志慷慨就义这一场时，参加排演的同志，都哭不成声。当时我们提出要化悲痛为力量，积极工作，使全中国早日解放，为刘胡兰同志报仇！
    六月五日，我在报纸上看到杀害刘胡兰同志的凶犯张匪全宝被山西省万泉县人民政府捕获的消息，高兴得说不出话来。我建议山西省万泉县人民政府把张匪全宝押到刘胡兰同志的墓前处决。
                  中央人民政府铁道部公安干部学校  王永安
        （三）山西省人民政府裴丽生主席：中共山西省委员会书记赖若愚同志：
    最近我们在报纸上看到了杀害刘胡兰同志的凶犯张全宝落网的消息，我们都高兴得跳了起来。
    歌剧“刘胡兰”曾在我县农村演出，这给我县广大党员干部以很大的教育。有些过去工作消极的干部，看了歌剧“刘胡兰”后，工作积极了。我县广大干部提出要向刘胡兰同志学习的口号，坚决以积极工作、巩固人民民主专政的实际行动，来为刘胡兰同志报仇。今天，杀害刘胡兰同志的凶手张匪全宝终于落网了，为刘胡兰报仇的日子到来了。
    我们向你们建议：你们审讯张匪全宝后，一定要把该犯押到文水县云周西村处决。反革命分子在那里欠下人民的血债，我们就叫他在那里偿还。
