Chongqing's Fifth District's Experience in Organizing Production for Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel

    In order to solve the livelihood difficulties of poor families of martyrs and military personnel, Chongqing's Fifth District helped 268 people establish twelve small-scale production units such as tofu workshops, vegetable joint ventures, sewing, rice shops, laundry, and straw sandal making, basically solving their livelihood problems. The district gained the following experiences in organizing production for families of martyrs and military personnel:

    First, educate cadres to value preferential treatment work, and educate families of martyrs and military personnel to actively participate in labor production. At the beginning of organizing production for families of martyrs and military personnel in the district, both cadres and families of martyrs and military personnel lacked confidence. Some people emphasized difficulties such as the dispersed residences of families of martyrs and military personnel, lack of professional skills, and lack of production funds. In response to these ideological situations, the district leadership successively held conferences to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of martyrs and military personnel, as well as various large and small production seminars attended by families of martyrs and military personnel, people from all walks of life, and relevant organs and groups, emphasizing that families of martyrs and military personnel should be respected by the people, and everyone has a responsibility to help them solve their production and livelihood difficulties, and the most basic way is to organize them to participate in production, and appropriately criticize the incorrect thinking of simply relying on relief among the families of martyrs and military personnel. After such repeated propaganda and education, the cadres' confidence was increased, the families of martyrs and military personnel were also willing to participate in production, and various organs, groups, and people from all walks of life were willing to help the families of martyrs and military personnel solve production difficulties, thus enabling the production work of families of martyrs and military personnel to be carried out smoothly.

    Second, when organizing production, attention should be paid to publicizing and educating relevant industries and the masses in the local area to obtain their help. For example, when the district organized a tofu workshop, it was estimated that the minimum cost would be 5 million yuan. After convening a meeting with tofu industry peers and the masses, with everyone's help, technicians and furniture were resolved. Before the tofu workshop opened, the district invited administrative personnel from local organs and schools to a meeting, solved the sales problem, and received advance payments of more than 1.7 million yuan. Therefore, the tofu workshop, which required at least 5 million yuan in funds, only borrowed 900,000 yuan from the government. This shows that as long as cadres engaged in civil affairs work widely publicize the significance of preferential treatment for families of martyrs and military personnel, and rely on the masses everywhere, the work of preferential treatment for families of martyrs and military personnel will definitely be done well.

    Third, organizing production should proceed from reality, with the scale from small to large, and the number of people from small to large. Under normal circumstances, in the early stage of organizing production for families of martyrs and military personnel, it is best to engage in some simple handicraft industries, such as laundry, straw sandal making, and tofu workshops. Before organizing production, attention should be paid to investigating the needs of the local market, so that the produced finished products will have sales. For example, two military dependents in Longmenhao in the district could make straw sandals, and it was the summer season, and there were many local porters, and the sales of straw sandals were good, so it was decided to organize a straw sandal making team.

    Fourth, because the composition of each member of the families of martyrs and military personnel is different, the level of skills varies, and some people usually lack labor concepts and collective living habits, cadres must strengthen their leadership of the production organization. Only in this way can problems be discovered and solved in a timely manner, maintain the unity within the families of martyrs and military personnel, and the production organization will be consolidated. For example, in a tofu workshop of a certain family of martyrs and military personnel in the district, not long after it opened, the technician was negatively slacking due to salary issues, and disunity also occurred among the families of martyrs and military personnel due to uneven labor. After the cadres of the district promptly learned about it, organized the families of martyrs and military personnel to discuss, found the root cause of the disunity, and resolved it appropriately, so that production was not affected.

    In addition, the handling of production profits should be through democratic appraisal, and the method of remuneration based on labor should be adopted; and attention should be paid to cultivating and improving the production skills of families of martyrs and military personnel from a long-term perspective, which is also a problem worthy of attention in the work of organizing production for families of martyrs and military personnel.

### 重庆市五区组织烈属军属生产的经验

　　重庆市五区组织烈属军属生产的经验
    重庆市第五区为了解决贫苦烈属军属的生活困难，帮助二百六十八人建立了豆腐作坊、蔬菜联营、缝纫、米粮铺、洗衣和打草鞋等十二个小型生产单位，基本上解决了他们的生活问题。该区在组织烈属军属生产工作上获得下面几点经验：
    第一、教育干部重视优抚工作，并教育烈属、军属积极参加劳动生产。该区在开始组织烈属军属的生产时，干部和烈属军属都缺乏信心。有的人强调烈属、军属住地分散，缺乏专业技术，更缺乏生产资金等困难。该区领导上针对这些思想情况，先后召开了拥护军队优待烈属军属大会及烈属军属、各阶层群众和有关机关团体参加的各种大小型的生产座谈会，强调说明烈属军属应受到人民的尊敬，大家有责任帮助他们解决生产与生活的困难，而最基本的办法，就是组织他们参加生产，并适当批判了烈属军属中单纯依赖救济的不正确思想。经过这样反复的宣传教育后，干部的信心提高了，烈属军属也愿意参加生产，各机关、团体和社会人士都愿帮助烈属军属解决生产上的困难，因而使烈属军属的生产工作得到顺利开展。
    第二、在组织生产时，应注意对当地有关的行业和群众进行宣传教育，取得他们的帮助。如该区在组织豆腐作坊时，估计最少需成本五百万元，后经召集豆腐行的同业和群众开会动员后，在大家的帮助下，技师和家具等都得到解决。豆腐作坊开业前，该区又邀请当地机关学校的事务人员开会，解决了销路问题，并收到了预订货款一百七十余万元。因此至少需要五百万元资金的豆腐作坊，结果只向政府贷了九十万元。这就说明，只要从事民政工作的干部广泛宣传优待烈属军属工作的意义，处处依靠群众，优待烈属军属的工作一定能够作好。
    第三、组织生产应从实际出发，规模由小到大，人数由少到多。在一般情况下，组织烈属军属生产的初期，最好先搞一些简单的手工工业，如洗衣、打草鞋和豆腐坊等。在组织生产前应注意调查当地市场的需要，生产成品才会有销路。如该区龙门浩的两个军属会打草鞋，而且时届夏令，当地搬运工人多，草鞋销路良好，就决定组织打草鞋组。
    第四、由于烈属军属中每个人的成份不同，技能高低不一，有的人平时又缺乏劳动观念和集体生活习惯，因此干部必须加强对生产组织的领导。只有这样，才能及时发现和解决问题，保持烈属军属内部的团结，生产组织才会巩固。如该区某一烈属军属的豆腐作坊，开业不久，技师因待遇问题而消极怠工，烈属军属中也因劳逸不均，产生了不团结的现象。经该区干部及时了解，组织烈属军属讨论，找出了不团结的根源，予以适当解决，才没有使生产受到影响。
    此外，生产利润的处理应通过民主评议，采取按劳取酬的办法；并应从长期着眼，注意培养和提高烈属军属的生产技术，这也是组织烈属军属生产工作中值得注意的问题。
