　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 29th: The historical documents and leaders' speeches of the Chinese Communist Party are receiving increasingly widespread attention from the Communist Parties of Western Europe and the United States. These works, which summarize the rich experience of the Chinese people's revolution, have been published in many countries and are being enthusiastically studied by the advanced fighters of the working class.
　　In France, the publication of Chairman Mao Zedong's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" in July 1949 was a major event. "L'Humanité" published the full text of the article, and shortly thereafter, the leadership of the French Communist Party called on members to organize group discussions on the article nationwide. Since then, whenever the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party publish important documents, "L'Humanité" almost always publishes them in the "Theory and History" section as study material for party members, such as Liu Shaoqi's report at the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference in Beijing.
　　Chairman Mao's famous work "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" was published in the French Communist Party's "Communist Handbook" in February 1949, and a separate edition was published at the beginning of this year, with a preface by Magnien. French Communist Marcel Erlid specifically wrote a detailed review in the April issue of the "Communist Handbook." The magazine has also published other works by Chairman Mao, including "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" (October 1949 issue) and "On Practice" (February 1951 issue).
　　The British working people can now also read the works of Chairman Mao and other Chinese people's leaders. In addition to the London "Daily Worker" and "Communist Review" frequently publishing such works, the British Communist Party has published Mao's "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and "On New Democracy." The British Communist Party's "Labour Monthly" is currently soliciting articles from famous Marxists in preparation for the publication of a special issue commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. The journal has also included "On Practice" in its 30th anniversary series. Last April, the Education Department of the British Communist Party organized a half-month workshop, which included a course on "China's New Democracy." The teaching and discussion content of this course included: the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship and Mao Zedong Thought, and China's example in the struggle for national independence in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The designated reference books for this course included Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party," which, along with "On Internationalism and Nationalism," has been recognized as a textbook for Marxist study. Farber, in an article in the January issue of "Communist Review" discussing the achievements of the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, particularly pointed out that Liu Shaoqi's report on the Party Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party at the Congress was an outstanding contribution to the organizational theory of the proletarian vanguard party, and that "the experience and achievements of the Chinese Communist Party are a remarkable proof that the Leninist organizational theory is universally applicable."
　　Among members of the American Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong's works have a wide influence. This can be seen from a message in the member communication column of the April issue of "Political Affairs" magazine. An American Communist Party female member wrote a letter vividly reporting the process of her party group reading and discussing Mao's "Combat Liberalism" at a meeting. She described the essay as a mirror for every party member present. She said: "Our group has been working much better since we reviewed it according to Mao Zedong's paper. We have discarded a lot of passivity that existed before, and our self-criticism is also unfolding. Some of us who used to just complain casually no longer take that outsider attitude." The same issue of "Political Affairs" published Mao's "On Practice."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th: Sydney News: The Australian Communist Party's monthly magazine "Communist Review" has begun to publish Mao's "On Practice" serially from the May issue this year.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th: TASS, Leningrad: The Library of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, in celebration of the upcoming 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, presented more than 700 books to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its Shanghai and Harbin branches on the 26th. Among these books are some of the latest publications of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on various disciplines, specialized works, and research reports; for example, the complete works of outstanding Russian scientists such as Chebyshev, Mendeleev, Williams, Pavlov, Dokuchaev, Komarov, and Krylov. In addition, there are also Academician Zhudakov's work on automobile construction and a manual for forest protection belt planters.

    重视学习中共历史文献和领袖言论 
   苏联科学院图书馆为中共三十周年赠书中苏友协
    【新华社布拉格二十九日电】中国共产党的历史文献和领袖言论，受到西欧各国及美国共产党日益广泛的重视。这些总结了中国人民革命丰富经验的著作已在许多国家发表，为各国工人阶级的先进战士们热烈地研究和学习着。
    在法国，一九四九年七月毛泽东主席《论人民民主专政》的发表是一件大事。《人道报》刊登了这篇文章的全文，不久以后，法国共产党领导机构号召党员在全国对这篇文章组织小组讨论。此后，中国共产党领袖们每有重要文件发表，《人道报》几乎都在《理论和历史》栏登载，作为党员的学习材料。例如刘少奇在北京亚澳工会会议上的报告等等。
    毛主席的名著《中国革命战争的战略问题》，一九四九年二月就已在法共的《共产主义手册》上发表，今年年初又出版了单行本，并附有马尼安的序言。法国共产党人马塞尔·艾里多还特地在四月号的《共产主义手册》上写了一篇详尽的评介。该杂志并曾发表毛主席的其他著作，其中有《论人民民主专政》（一九四九年十月号）和《实践论》（一九五一年二月号）。
    英国劳动人民现在也可以读到毛主席和其他中国人民领袖的著作。除了伦敦工人日报和《共产主义评论》时常刊载这类著作之外，英国共产党并出版了毛主席的《论人民民主专政》、《新民主主义论》。英共《劳动月刊》目前正在向著名的马克思主义者征集文章，准备出版纪念中国共产党三十周年的专刊。该刊并把《实践论》列入其创刊三十周年纪念丛书中。去年四月，英国共产党教育部组织了半月讲习班，其中有《中国的新民主主义》一门课程，这门课程的讲授和讨论内容包括：中国共产党的成立，人民民主专政和毛泽东思想，中国在殖民地半殖民地国家争取民族独立斗争中的榜样。这门课程的指定参考书中有刘少奇的《论党》，这本书和《论国际主义与民族主义》已被公认为马克思主义学习的教科书。法尔伯在今年一月号的《共产主义评论》著文论述中国共产党第七次全国代表大会的成就时，特别指出：刘少奇在大会上关于中国共产党党章的报告，是对无产阶级先锋政党的组织理论的杰出贡献，“中国共产党的经验和成就是列宁主义的组织理论放诸四海而皆准的显著证明”。
    在美国共产党党员中，毛泽东主席的著作有很广泛的影响。这一点可以从今年四月号《政治问题》杂志党员通讯栏的一段消息中看出来。一位美共女党员来信，生动地报告了她所属的党小组在一次会议上宣读并讨论毛主席所著《反对自由主义》一文的经过。她把这篇论文形容为在场每一个党员的一面镜子。她说：“我们的小组自从根据毛泽东的论文进行了检讨之后，工作就好得多了。我们抛弃了大量以前存在过的被动性，我们的自我批评也在展开，我们当中有些人以前的确只是随便发发牢骚的，现在已不再采取那种局外人的态度了。”同一期的《政治问题》发表了毛主席的《实践论》。
    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党的《共产主义评论》月刊自今年五月号起，开始连续刊登毛主席的《实践论》。
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社列宁格勒讯：苏联科学院图书馆为祝贺即将到来的中国共产党诞生三十周年，特于二十六日把七百多册书籍赠送给中苏友好协会及其上海分会和哈尔滨分会。在这些书籍中，有些是苏联科学院最近出版的关于各种学科的书籍、专门著作和研究报告；例如契比雪夫、门德雷叶夫、威廉斯、巴夫洛夫、多库查也夫、科马罗夫、克里洛夫等杰出的俄国科学家的全集。此外还有科学院院士朱达科夫关于汽车构造的著作和森林防护带种植工人的手册。
