The Wanquan County People's Government of Shanxi Province, during the trial of the murderer Bandit Zhang Quanbao, obtained the following confession from Bandit Zhang regarding the murder of Comrade Liu Hulan and other comrades: In October 1946, Bandit Zhang's unit, namely the 215th Regiment, 1st Battalion of the 72nd Division of Yan Xishan's bandit army's 61st Army, sneaked into Daxiang Town, Wenshui County. Bandit Zhang was unable to accompany the battalion at that time and only arrived at the garrison in November. On the third day after Bandit Zhang arrived at the garrison, he was summoned by the battalion headquarters. Bandit Battalion Commander Feng Xiaoyi and Deputy Battalion Commander Hou Bingyin told Bandit Zhang: "Liu Hulan and others have been investigated. Troops will be dispatched immediately to deal with them. You can go with the Second Company to help handle the matter." The list of "murderers" was carried by Company Commander Bandit Xu Desheng. At that time, the leaders of the landlord and rich peasant-organized "Retribution Team" of Yunzhou West Village, and the captain of Yan bandit's so-called "Daxiang Town Revenge Self-Defense Force," led the way because they recognized Comrade Liu Hulan.

The next day after breakfast, Bandit Zhang and others broke into Yunzhou West Village. They placed sentries at the village entrance and then captured Comrade Liu Hulan and other comrades. Seven people were captured at that time, including Comrade Liu Hulan. At the same time, Bandit Zhang forced more than 200 farmers to attend a "meeting" at the Great Temple in the south of the village. After the captain of the Retribution Team of the village reported the "significance of the meeting," Bandit Zhang went on stage and ranted, slandering Comrade Liu Hulan and other comrades, as well as the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. After that, Company Commander Bandit Xu Desheng announced the "crimes" of Comrade Liu Hulan. Then, bandits Zhang and Xu forced the masses to kill Comrade Liu Hulan and other comrades. In fact, the bandits had already agreed before they set out that the "militia" captain of the village and the captain of the Daxiang Town "Revenge Team" would lead their members to kill them. Bandit Zhang asked Comrade Liu Hulan and other comrades who had killed the reactionary village chief and who else was a Communist Party member. Comrade Liu Hulan and others were impassioned and sternly rebuked them. Comrade Liu Hulan said: "I am the only Communist Party member, there are no others!" Bandit Zhang and others shamelessly demanded that Comrade Liu Hulan "confess," and said that "confession is self-salvation, confession will get a piece of land." Comrade Hulan answered the bandits solemnly: "I will not confess!" Seeing that deception and enticement were unsuccessful, the bandits immediately killed another comrade to threaten Comrade Hulan, asking her, "Are you afraid?" Comrade Hulan replied, "I am not afraid of death, kill me if you want!" At this time, the bandits viciously chopped down the other comrades, and when it came to chopping Liu Hulan, Bandit Zhang and others asked the masses, "Is she a good person or a bad person?" An elderly farmer said, "She is a good person!" Bandit Zhang said, "If you say she is a good person, we'll chop you first." When Comrade Hulan voluntarily lay down under the铡刀 (铡刀, a type of guillotine-like blade used for chopping fodder and sometimes as an execution device), the whole crowd went forward to beg. Bandit Zhang and Xu Desheng firmly refused, and Comrade Hulan died calmly.

According to the investigation, Bandit Zhang Quanbao, with the childhood name Si'er, is now named Zhang Shenghao. He lives at No. 1 Weijia Alley, Yuncheng Town, Shanxi Province. Bandit Zhang joined the "Dare-to-Die Eleventh Column" in 1936. After being captured by the Japanese invaders in Jiaocheng in 1937, he joined Yan Xishan's bandit army 71st Division New 9th Regiment, which was later reorganized into the "Guerrilla 5th Column 15th Detachment." In 1942, Bandit Zhang served as a second lieutenant platoon leader in the 3rd Regiment of the 44th Division of Chiang bandit army's 34th Army. In 1943, he climbed to the position of lieutenant platoon leader and adjutant. In 1944, after receiving military training from Yan bandit, he joined Yan bandit's "Comrades Association" and the Kuomintang. In 1945, he became a captain adjutant. In 1946, he served as a lieutenant company instructor in the machine gun company of the 1st Battalion of the 215th Regiment of the 72nd Division of the 61st Army. Bandit Zhang Quanbao has always been an enemy of the people, cruelly slaughtering the masses and our revolutionary cadres, but he ultimately could not escape the people's justice and was captured by us.

　　张匪全宝供认惨杀刘胡兰经过
    山西万泉县人民政府在审讯杀人凶犯张匪全宝时，张匪供认杀害刘胡兰等同志的经过如下：一九四六年十月，张匪所在的部队，即阎锡山匪部六十一军七十二师二一五团一营窜驻文水县大相镇。当时张犯未能随该营前往，于十一月始到达驻地。张犯到达驻地的第三天，为营部派人叫去。营长冯匪效义与副营长侯匪丙寅对张匪说：“刘胡兰等人调查出来了，现在马上就要派部队去处理，你可以随第二连前往帮助办理。”“凶手”名单由连长徐匪得胜携带。当时云周西村反动地主、富农组织的倒算队队长及阎匪所谓“大相镇复仇自卫队”队长等带路，因为他们认得刘胡兰同志。
    第二天早饭后，张犯等闯进了云周西村。他们在村口放上哨，随即捕捉刘胡兰等同志。当时被捉到七人，刘胡兰同志在内。与此同时，张犯强迫二百多农民到村南大庙“开会”。该村倒算队长报告“开会意义”后，张犯就上台狂吠，诬蔑刘胡兰等同志，并诬蔑共产党和解放军。之后，连长徐匪得胜宣读了刘胡兰同志的“罪恶”。接着张、徐二匪便强迫群众下手杀害刘胡兰等同志。事实上，匪徒们在未出发时即已商妥，确定由该村“民兵”队长及大相镇“复仇队”队长带领队员下手杀害她们。张犯曾问刘胡兰等同志是谁杀了反动村长，还有谁是共产党员。刘胡兰等同志慷慨激昂，痛加斥责。刘胡兰同志说：“共产党员只有我一个，再没有了！”张犯等更无耻地要刘胡兰同志“自白”，并说“自白即是自救，自白了给一份土地”。胡兰同志严正地回答了匪徒：“不自白！”匪徒们见欺骗利诱不成，立即杀死另外一个同志，来威胁胡兰同志，问她：“怕不怕”？胡兰同志答道：“死也不怕，要杀便杀！”这时，匪徒们便下毒手，铡了其他的同志，最后要铡刘胡兰同志时，张犯等问群众：“她是好人还是坏人？”一位老年农民说：“是好人！”张犯说：“你说好人先铡你。”当胡兰同志自动躺在铡刀下时，全场群众都上前哀求。张犯和徐匪得胜坚不答应，胡兰同志乃从容就义。
    按，张匪全宝，奶名四儿，现名张生昊。住山西省运城镇卫家小巷门牌一号。张犯于一九三六年参加“决死十一纵队”。一九三七年在交城被日寇俘掳后，又到阎锡山匪部七十一师新九团当兵，该部后曾改编为“游击五纵队十五支队”。一九四二年，张犯充当蒋匪军三十四军四十四师三团少尉排长，一九四三年爬到中尉排长副官的职位，一九四四年受阎匪军事训练后加入阎匪“同志会”及国民党，一九四五年又混上上尉副官的职位，一九四六年充当六十一军七十二师二一五团一营机枪连中尉连指导员。张匪全宝一贯与人民为敌，残酷屠杀群众及我革命干部，但终未能逃脱人民法网，为我捕获。
