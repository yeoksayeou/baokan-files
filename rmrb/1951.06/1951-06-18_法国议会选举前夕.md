　　Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: TASS Moscow, June 16th: The Pravda correspondent in Paris, Zhu Zhukov, in an article entitled "On the Eve of the Elections," uses Paris as an example to describe the final preparations for the French parliamentary elections.

　　Zhu Zhukov writes: In France, only one party—the Communist Party—believes it is its duty to present voters with a concise and clear program. Only its parliamentarians consider it their duty to regularly report their work to the people. They have nothing to hide from the voters. Their plans align with the aspirations of the working people. It is precisely for these reasons that all bourgeois parties have banded together before the election, spreading lies and striving to slander the Communists. It is also for these reasons that the reactionaries have come up with the notorious new electoral law, seeking to prevent Communists from being elected to parliament in any place where bourgeois party groups can manage to barely scrape together 50% of the vote.

　　In Paris, many diverse gatherings have been held, from mass meetings of thousands of people in halls and open squares to small residents' meetings in single rooms. The megalomaniac de Gaulle strives to copy Hitler's old tricks. As soon as he steps onto the podium, his guards roar loudly, just like the sounds frequently heard at the Nuremberg rallies in the past. The meetings of Pétain's successors often end in outright brawls. At these meetings, one can hear shouts of restoring fascism and eliminating Jews. And the Socialists and Christian Democratic Republicans often speak to halls that are half empty.

　　The largest and most exciting meetings are those of the Communists. Participating in these meetings are not only workers but also clerks and small business owners. The candidates of the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance presented to the masses their specific program of struggle for peace, bread, freedom, and the restoration of French national independence. The meetings held in public dormitories take place hundreds of thousands of times every day. However, the various reactionary parties in France cannot send agitators to working-class residential areas, to the families and public dormitories of the working people, as they know what fate awaits these people in those places.

　　The reactionary camp is panic-stricken and anxious. Precisely because of this, a series of terrorist acts have occurred towards the end of the election campaign. De Gaulle's thugs have intensified their attacks on the locations of progressive social organizations, brutally assaulting the leaders of these organizations. The police have also been carrying out increasingly open attacks directly on workers actively participating in the election campaign, sometimes even initiated by the American occupiers themselves, as happened recently in Vauquiville near Cherbourg. The police forces only recently stopped tearing down posters put up by workers but have now been attacking workers with weapons more frequently. Recently, almost everywhere, workers have been illegally arrested for putting up posters.

　　Zhu Zhukov concludes: These are some of the facts illustrating the situation in the Paris region during the final preparations for the parliamentary elections.

### 法国议会选举前夕

　　法国议会选举前夕
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：《真理报》驻巴黎记者朱可夫在“选举前夕”一文中，以巴黎为例，描写了法国议会选举的最后准备情况。
    朱可夫写道：法国只有一个政党——共产党——认为向选民提出简要而明确的纲领是它的职责。只有它的议员们认为定期向人民报告工作情况是他们的职责。他们没有任何需要对选民隐瞒的事情。他们的计划符合劳动人民的愿望。正是因为这些原因，所以在选举前，资产阶级的一切政党都结成一伙，大量地散播谎言，竭力诽谤共产党人。也正是因为这些原因，所以反动派想出了臭名远扬的新选举法，要在资产阶级政党集团可以设法勉强凑到百分之五十的选票的任何地方，都能阻止共产党人选入议会。
    在巴黎，举行了许多形形色色的集会，有在大厅里和露天广场上举行的几千人的群众大会，也有在一个房间里举行的小小的居民会议。充满了自大狂的戴高乐努力抄袭希特勒的故技。他一走上讲台，他的卫队就大声吼叫，正像以前在纽伦堡的会议上经常发出的声音一样。贝当的后辈们的会议经常是以公然的全武行结束。在这些会议上，可以听到恢复法西斯主义和消灭犹太人这类的喊叫。而社会党人和天主教人民共和党人往往对着空着一半席位的大厅讲话。
    规模最大、最令人兴奋的会议是共产党人的会议。参加这些会议的，不仅有工人，还有职员、小商人。共和反法西斯抵抗联盟的候选人在会上向群众提出自己为争取和平、面包、自由，争取恢复法国民族独立的具体斗争纲领。在公共宿舍中所举行的会议，每天都要开几十万个。但是法国各反动党派却不能派遣煽动家到工人住宅区、到劳动人民的家庭和公共宿舍中去，它们知道这些人在那些地方会遭遇到什么命运。
    反动阵营惊惶失措，焦虑不安。正是因为如此，在竞选运动的末期，就发生了一连串的恐怖行动。戴高乐派的打手变本加厉地袭击进步社会团体的所在地，残暴地殴辱这些团体的领导人物。警察对积极参加竞选运动的工人直接进行的公开进攻也越来越多了，这种进攻有时甚至由美国占领者亲自来发动，例如在瑟堡附近的瓦奎维，最近就发生了这种事件。警察部队直到最近才停止撕毁工人所张贴的标语，然而却又更频繁地以武器来进攻工人。近来几乎到处都有工人因张贴标语而被非法逮捕。
    朱可夫最后说：这就是说明议会选举前巴黎地区最后准备工作期中的情况的若干事实。
