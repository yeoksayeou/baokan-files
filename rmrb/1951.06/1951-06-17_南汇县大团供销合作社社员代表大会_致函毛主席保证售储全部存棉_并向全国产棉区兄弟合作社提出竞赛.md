    and Proposes Competition to Brother Cooperatives in Cotton Producing Areas Nationwide
    [Our Dispatch] The entire body of representatives from the Second Members' Representative Assembly of the Datuan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nanhui County, Sunan District, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on June 8th, resolving to mobilize all members to sell and store all their cotton in the cooperative before June 20th.

The full text of both letters follows:

            Letter to Chairman Mao
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    Under your wise leadership, we have been allocated land, uprooted the feudal roots, and developed large-scale production, organizing a supply and marketing cooperative of thirteen thousand eight hundred people (accounting for 42% of the district's agricultural population). To fully supply industrial raw materials, the district's cotton fields have increased by seventeen thousand mu this year compared to last year. The cooperative has supplied cotton farmers with more than thirteen thousand eight hundred bean cakes, helped cotton farmers sell more than two million three hundred fifty-nine thousand nine hundred jin of cotton, and loaned and sold more than two hundred sixty-five thousand jin of cotton seeds, reducing intermediary exploitation by two hundred sixty million yuan.
    In order to better run the cooperative in the future, we convened a members' representative assembly of two hundred and forty-three people. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution to resolutely support the State Council's instructions on cotton purchase and storage work, guaranteeing the supply of raw materials for the mechanical textile industry before the new cotton season, and satisfying the clothing needs of the military and civilians nationwide. We have already taken action: within five days, we have sold and stored five hundred and fifty-nine dan of cotton and unanimously guarantee to mobilize all members to consciously and voluntarily sell and store all remaining cotton to the cooperative before June 20th, resolutely completing this glorious patriotic task. We wish you good health.
                                  Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Nanhui County, Sunan District
                             Respectfully from the entire body of representatives of the Second Members' Representative Assembly

            Letter to Cooperatives in Cotton Producing Areas Nationwide
    To all brother cooperatives in cotton producing areas nationwide:
    Our Second Members' Representative Assembly of the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Nanhui County, has discussed the State Council's instructions regarding cotton purchase and storage work, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives' call to launch a patriotic cotton sale and storage competition. We unanimously and wholeheartedly support it and resolve to respond with practical actions. In the past five days, we have already sold and stored five hundred and fifty-nine dan of cotton. Now, we hereby challenge all brother cooperatives, willing to engage in a patriotic cotton sale and storage competition with you. We guarantee:
    (1) To continue mobilizing members to consciously and voluntarily sell and store all remaining cotton to the cooperative before June 20th, completing the planned two thousand dan, as a concrete action to resist America and aid Korea.
    (2) To resolutely implement the assembly's resolutions, and continue to mobilize farmers to join the cooperative through summer plowing, weeding, pest control, fertilization, flood control, drought resistance, and matching sales and supply operations, as well as organizational consolidation.
    (3) To guarantee a bumper cotton harvest, striving for the first batch of new cotton to enter the factories.
    We sincerely await your enthusiastic response. With revolutionary greetings!
      The 243 representatives signed from the Second Members' Representative Assembly of the Datuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Nanhui County
