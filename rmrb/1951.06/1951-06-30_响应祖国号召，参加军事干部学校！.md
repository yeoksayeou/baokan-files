    Responding to the Motherland's Call, Join the Military Cadre School!
        (I) To the Editor:
    I have decided to enroll in a military cadre school and dedicate myself to the great national defense construction of the motherland.
    I am the child of a revolutionary martyr's family. My brother, Zhao Tong, was brutally murdered by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang during the "February 28th" uprising of the Taiwanese people. I will never forget the bloody atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in massacring the people of Taiwan. Today, American imperialism is occupying our country's Taiwan and launching a war of aggression in Korea. In order to strengthen and consolidate the motherland's national defense forces and shatter the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, I am determined to enroll in a military cadre school.
    I am an eighteen-year-old student who is about to graduate from junior high school. I deeply feel the happiness of living in the Mao Zedong era. In order to protect our happiness and strive for a better future, I have a responsibility and am determined to dedicate myself to the motherland's national defense construction.
        Zhao Min, Student of the Affiliated Middle School No. 1 of the Normal University
  (II) To the Editor:
    I was overjoyed to see the State Council's "Decision on Enrolling Students in Military Cadre Schools." A long time ago, I made up my mind to go where the motherland needs me most and to dedicate myself to the motherland's national defense construction.
    I often think that I can study at Peking University and live a free and happy life because we have a great motherland and because we have Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! Before liberation, when I was in middle school, I often went hungry because I had no money to pay for food. I participated in the righteous student movement and suffered all kinds of oppression from the Kuomintang reactionary government. After graduating from middle school, I lost my schooling and couldn't find a job, and life was even more miserable. At that time, I was depressed, pessimistic, and desperate. After liberation, the motherland gave me a new life and a future, and gave me beautiful youth. I love the motherland, and I decided to exercise, study hard, improve my political awareness, and wait for the motherland to call. Now, the motherland has issued a call to us. I have been prepared for a long time. I resolutely and enthusiastically respond to the motherland's call and am determined to dedicate myself to the great national defense construction of the motherland.

    响应祖国号召，参加军事干部学校！
        （一）编辑同志：
    我决定报名参加军事干部学校，献身于伟大祖国的国防建设事业。
    我是一个革命烈士家属的子弟。我的哥哥赵桐，在台湾人民“二·二八”起义运动中被蒋介石匪帮残杀了。我永远不能忘记蒋介石匪帮屠杀台湾人民的血腥暴行。今天，美帝国主义侵占我国的台湾、并在朝鲜发动侵略战争。为了加强和巩固祖国的国防力量，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，我决心报名参加军事干部学校。
    我是一个年满十八岁、即将初中毕业的学生。我深深感到生活在毛泽东时代的幸福。为了保卫我们的幸福，并争取更美好的将来，我有责任并且有决心献身于祖国的国防建设事业。
        师范大学附属中学一部学生  赵敏
  （二）编辑同志：
    看到政务院“关于军事干部学校招收学生的决定”，我高兴极了。很久以前，我就下了决心，要到祖国最需要的地方去，要献身于祖国国防建设事业。
    我常想，我能到北京大学念书，过着自由幸福的日子，是因为有了伟大的祖国，是因为有了毛主席共产党！解放前我在中学念书时，因为无钱缴伙食，时常挨饿。我参加了正义的学生运动，受到国民党反动政府种种的压迫。中学毕业后，我失了学，也找不到职业，生活更惨。那时，我意志消沉，悲观绝望。解放后，祖国给了我新的生命和前途，给了我美丽的青春。我热爱祖国，我决定要锻炼身体，努力学习，提高政治水平，等待着祖国号召。现在，祖国向我们发出了号召。我早就准备好了，我坚决地热烈地响应祖国号召，决心献身于伟大祖国的国防建设事业。
