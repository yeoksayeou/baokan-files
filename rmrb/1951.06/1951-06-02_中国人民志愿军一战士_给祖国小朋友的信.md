A Chinese People's Volunteer Army Soldier
A Letter to the Children of the Motherland

Dear Young Pioneers of the Motherland:

Here on the Korean battlefield, we received your letters, and everyone crowded around to read them, as happy as if we were reading a victory bulletin after winning a battle. The letter said: "Volunteer Army uncles: Behind you are millions of children wearing red scarves supporting you!" These words have encouraged our strong will to fight, and we will fight to the end to defend world peace and defend the motherland!

You all expressed: "We will not allow American imperialism to infringe upon the happy paradise of us and the Korean children!" We have seen with our own eyes what the Korean children's paradise – the Korean land – has been ravaged into by the American bandits. Many children have been deprived of their fathers and mothers by the American bandits. As soon as you ask the children "Where did your father and mother go?" they will gesture to show how their relatives were brutally murdered by the American invading army. In the home of a man named Cui Yongxi in Shangduanli, Guicheng County, only a pile of earth remained after being bombed by American planes. When the fourteen-year-old child returned from the mountain after collecting firewood, he saw that his home had been bombed, and his parents and family were blown to bits, with no corpses to be found. Just as this child was wailing in grief, we passed by him, the smell of gunpowder still lingering. We advised him with sorrow: "Don't cry, remember this blood debt!" The child stomped his feet and howled. He gestured with his firewood axe towards himself. We didn't understand what he meant, but the accompanying translator told us that he meant he wanted to join the army, shoulder a gun, eliminate the American devils, and avenge his parents! After hearing this, everyone nodded and said, "Jiao si mi da (good)!"

Children, there are many such things! Think about it, who would want their parents to be raped and murdered by bandits, who would want their beautiful motherland to be invaded by invaders?

The Young Pioneers of North Korea, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, have created many moving and inspiring deeds. I still remember this story:

There is a fourteen-year-old child named Han Renhao, whose home is in Pyongyang, and whose parents are both doctors. Last year, when the American invading army invaded Pyongyang, they killed both of his parents. Han Renhao ran to the People's Committee and insisted on joining the army to eliminate the American devils, but because he was too young, the People's Committee did not approve his request. Later, he went to his uncle's house in Weili, Bochuan County. But he couldn't stay there; he was a North Korean Young Pioneer, and the fire of revenge burned in his heart. During the period when the enemy occupied Bochuan County, he convened a meeting of four Young Pioneers, encouraging them to remember what the People's Army uncles said before they left: "Who took away our children's happiness? Who destroyed our hometown? Who took the lives of our elders, brothers, and sisters? Remember! It is American imperialism. We must take revenge, and final victory belongs to us!" These words encouraged the children's hearts. They buried four hundred and fifty-seven bags full of bullets, as well as twenty grenades, that the People's Army had not taken away, in the mountains, preparing to send them to the People's Army. However, at this time, the area had already been occupied by the American devils, and the blockade was very tight, so they had to find another opportunity to send them. Even so, they were not reconciled and went everywhere to encourage children to do propaganda. Unfortunately, these children's great patriotic actions were discovered by the special agents of the Li Seung-man gang. One night, several children were discussing ideas for sending bullets to the People's Army when they were overheard by the enemy. The enemy arrested them and tortured them every day, asking where the bullets were buried, but they wouldn't say. The children knew that if the enemy knew about these bullets, they would use them to shoot the people. A strong will overcame the enemy's torture. Later, a child team member named Cui Liyi secretly pried open the door of their confinement, and all four of them escaped. When the People's Army and the Volunteer Army recovered Bochuan County, these four children handed over the bullets and grenades to the People's Army without any loss. The four Young Pioneers were commended.

Dear children! Don't forget that our happy life does not come easily; we must protect this good life. Dear children! For the sake of our motherland, for the sake of our great leader – Comrade Mao Zedong, for the sake of you, we must bravely advance and defeat the aggression of American imperialism!

　　中国人民志愿军一战士
    给祖国小朋友的信亲爱的祖国少年儿童队的小朋友们：
    在朝鲜战地，接到你们的来信，大家伙儿都围起来抢着，好像打了胜仗看捷报似的那么高兴。信中说：“志愿军叔叔们：你们的背后有千万个带红领巾的儿童来支援你们！”这些话鼓舞了我们战斗的坚强意志，我们一定为保卫世界和平保卫祖国战斗到底！
    你们都表示：“不让美帝国主义侵犯我们和朝鲜小朋友的幸福乐园！”我们亲眼看见了朝鲜儿童们的乐园——朝鲜国土，被美国强盗遭蹋成什么样子。很多儿童被美国强盗夺去了爹和娘，只要一问孩子们“爸爸妈妈那里去了？”他们就会打手式比划着他们的亲人被美国侵略军残害的情形。在龟城郡上端里一个叫崔永喜的人的家，被美国飞机炸得只剩一堆土。等到十四岁的孩子从山上打柴回来一看，家被炸啦，爹和娘一家人炸得连尸都找不到了。这个孩子正哇哇痛哭的时候，我们从他的面前通过，火药味还未熄灭。我们带着悲痛的心情劝他：“不要哭，要记住这一笔血债！”孩子跺着脚号啕大哭。他用砍柴的斧子往身上一比划。我们不懂他的意思，随军翻译告诉我们原来他的意思是：要参军，背上枪消灭美国鬼子，替父母报仇！大家听了之后点点头，说了声：“叫斯米达（好）！”
    小朋友们，这样的事多得很呢！你们想想，谁愿意自己的爹娘被强盗们奸淫和枪杀，谁愿自己美丽的祖国被侵略者进犯呢？
    北朝鲜的少年儿童队员们，在劳动党领导下，创造了很多可泣可歌的生动事迹。我还记着这么一段故事：
    有一个名叫韩仁镐的十四岁的小朋友，家在平壤，爸爸、妈妈都是医生。去年美国侵略军进犯平壤时，把他父母都杀害了。韩仁镐跑到人民委员会非要求参军消灭美国鬼子不可，因为他年纪小，人民委员会没有批准他的要求。他以后到博川郡未力里伯伯家中。可是他呆不下去，他是北朝鲜少年先锋队员，复仇的怒火燃烧着他的心。在敌人占领博川郡的期间，他召集了四个少年先锋队员开会，鼓动他们要记住人民军叔叔临走说的话：“谁把咱们儿童幸福夺去了？谁炸毁了咱们的家乡？谁把父老兄弟姐妹的生命夺去了？记住！是美帝国主义。我们一定要报仇，最后胜利是属于我们的！”这些话鼓舞着孩子们的心，他们把人民军没有带走的装满了子弹的四百五十七个袋子，还有二十个手榴弹，埋在山上，准备给人民军送去。可是，在这个时候当地已被美国鬼子们占领了，四外封锁的挺厉害，只得找机会再送。就这样，他们还不甘心，到处鼓动儿童作宣传。这些孩子们的伟大爱国举动不幸被李承晚匪帮的特务们知道了，一天晚上几个孩子正在讨论想法给人民军送子弹，被敌人听到了。敌人就把他们逮捕起来，天天拷打他们，问子弹埋在那里，可是他们怎的也不说。孩子们知道这些子弹被敌人知道了会拿来向人民开枪的。坚强的意志战胜了敌人的折磨。后来有个儿童队员崔力一偷偷地把禁闭他们的门给撬开了，他们四个人都偷跑了。等到人民军与志愿军收复了博川郡的时候，这四个孩子就把子弹和手榴弹毫无损失的交给了人民军。四个少年儿童队员受到了表扬。
    亲爱的小朋友们！别忘了，我们的幸福生活不是容易得来的，我们一定要保卫住这好日子。亲爱的小朋友们！为了我们的祖国，为了我们伟大的领袖——毛泽东同志，为了你们，我们一定要奋勇前进，打败美帝国主义的侵略！
