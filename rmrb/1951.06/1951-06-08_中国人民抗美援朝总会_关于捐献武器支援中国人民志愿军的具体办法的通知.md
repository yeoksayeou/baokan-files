    China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Notice Regarding Specific Measures for Donating Weapons to Support the Chinese People's Volunteers

    In order to enable the Chinese People's Volunteers to more effectively cooperate with the Korean People's Army, eliminate more enemies, and strive for the early final victory of the War to Resist America and Aid Korea, this committee issued a notice on June 1st, calling on compatriots from all walks of life across the country to donate more weapons such as airplanes, artillery, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and anti-tank guns to the Volunteers. The following specific measures are hereby stipulated:

    (1) To ensure that people from all parts of the country, regardless of urban or rural areas, class, or belief, can promote this patriotic donation movement, there must be thorough and in-depth publicity and meticulous organizational work. Local committees and sub-committees to Resist America and Aid Korea should immediately convene representatives from local people's organizations, government agencies, and patriotic individuals from all walks of life to discuss and formulate specific plans for publicity and mobilizing donations, and proceed separately.

    (2) This movement should be combined with the movement to increase production and reduce costs in factories, with intensive cultivation and the development of household sideline industries in rural areas, and with improving business operations and increasing income in the industrial and commercial sectors. Other sectors should also find ways to donate more actively. Retired civil and military officials and other wealthy households in cities should be encouraged to actively participate in this patriotic donation movement.

    (3) The donation movement is tentatively set for a period of six months. Donations can be paid in one lump sum, or a certain amount can be pledged first and then paid in installments. All donations must be completely voluntary, and no one shall be forced to donate.

    (4) For ease of calculation, all donations shall be calculated in Renminbi. This committee has specially entrusted local People's Banks to collect the donations and remit them upwards. If people from all walks of life wish to donate gold, silver, jewelry, silver dollars, foreign exchange, or foreign currency, the local People's Bank can convert them at the exchange rate of the day. Rural donations shall be directly submitted by the handling organs of the village (township) to the county People's Bank.

    (5) All rural donations shall be publicly announced to the people once a month by the village (township), district, and county level governing bodies. The village should announce the names of the donors in the village and the amounts they donated, the district should announce the names of the donating villages in the district and the amounts donated by each village, and the county should announce the donating districts and villages in the county and the amounts donated by each district and each village. For urban donations, donors or agencies/organizations are requested to send the donations directly to the local People's Bank, obtain a receipt from the collecting bank, and write a letter to notify the local branch of the Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea. Each provincial branch should announce the names of the donors or units and the amounts they donated in the newspapers once a month. The donations received by the People's Banks in each province and city should be reported to the branches of the Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, the general branch, and then to the headquarters and the head office.

    (6) Individuals, enterprises, agencies, organizations, or regions who wish to designate their donations to purchase specific weapons should indicate this in writing when making the payment, so that this committee can handle it on their behalf.

    (7) For the convenience of calculation and planning for donations from all walks of life, it is hereby proposed that a donation of RMB 1.5 billion shall be considered equivalent to one fighter plane, a donation of RMB 5 billion shall be considered equivalent to one bomber, a donation of RMB 2.5 billion shall be considered equivalent to one tank, a donation of RMB 900 million shall be considered equivalent to one artillery piece, and a donation of RMB 800 million shall be considered equivalent to one anti-aircraft gun.

    (8) All donations from all localities shall be used by the headquarters in consultation with relevant parties to uniformly purchase weapons or other necessities for the Volunteers. No other party or agency shall be allowed to withdraw or misappropriate them.

    The above notice shall be notified to relevant parties by the general and sub-committees in all localities and implemented accordingly.

                                        June 7, 1951
