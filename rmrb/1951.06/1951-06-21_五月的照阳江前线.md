　　The Zhao Yang River Front in May
       Nai Yin
    I. Advancing Rapidly Towards Victory
    Having achieved a great victory in April, the Korean and Chinese People's forces, taking advantage of the enemy's unsteady respite in mid-May, crossed the Bukhan River again, directing their attack towards the Zhao Yang River front and launching the second phase of the counter-offensive.

    The Korean and Chinese People's forces marched day and night, advancing rapidly towards victory. The soldiers happily called their daily campsites "Tianliang Village" (Dawn Village) and "Taiyang Mountain" (Sun Mountain), and the barren hills and slopes became their "battlefield homes."

    During the march, sometimes food and vegetables were not supplied in time, so the soldiers went to the forests and barren mountains to dig up wild vegetables to eat. The cooks also created various ways to improve the meals. They crushed soybeans to make "vegetable tofu"; they mixed fried flour with whole kernels of corn and wild vegetables to make dumplings. The soldiers humorously called these dumplings "combat yuanxiao" (sweet rice balls) and "Resist America, Aid Korea Three Treasure Rice."

    Continuous forced marches caused many people's feet to swell and their legs to be injured. But what could be more important than eliminating the enemy? Communist Party member Shan Tianming's foot was wounded by a landmine in the April counter-offensive. When he heard that they were going to eliminate the enemy again, he refused all persuasion and insisted on following the troops. The volunteer heroes waded across the waist-deep Bukhan River and climbed the peaks towering in the clouds. Looking down at the rolling mountains beneath their feet and the endless stream of troops advancing towards the front line, they waved their sweaty faces and excitedly sang a quick-rhythm song: "Victory is a race, relying on legs to make meritorious service!"
  II. Dagger Thrust 120 Li
    At 16:00 on May 16th, the roar of artillery fire attacking from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army artillery positions on the north bank of the Zhao Yang River was heard. Troops from all directions, wading across the river from many locations, immediately pierced the enemy like countless sharp swords.

    The enemy's resistance did not diminish the speed of the troops' advance in the slightest. Soldiers fell into ditches and rivers, but they got up and ran after the others. The command was repeated in the ranks: "Run forward!" "Run forward!" Platoon Leader Yu Huawen's foot was pierced by two bullets, and blood flowed into his shoes and onto the ground. But he still gritted his teeth, limped, and continued to advance.

    Wherever there were enemies, firepower was directed there. Machine gunners held their machine guns and fired, and riflemen loaded bullets while running. At Shuinei Village, the enemy unleashed firepower from behind two rows of barbed wire. Communist Party member Fu Qingxiang raised his arms and shouted, "Communist Party members! Young League members! This is the time to meet the test!" He picked up explosives and rushed forward. In the sound of the explosion, the troops rushed past and crushed the enemy.

    This force, which suddenly appeared in the enemy's heart in the dark of night, left the enemy dumbfounded. Many puppet soldiers stood in rows by the roadside watching until they realized they had a gun pointed at their chests, and they hurriedly raised their hands.

    At 5:10 on the 17th, the vanguard troops reached their predetermined destination, cutting off the enemy's retreat. A total of 120 li was covered in 13 hours and 10 minutes. They did not walk there, but ran, climbing over more than a dozen mountain ridges. Supporting this superhuman perseverance was only one heroic will: For victory!
  III. The Great Rout of the Li Puppet Army
    On the night of the 17th, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army forces victoriously joined forces in the Dongcang Village area of ​​Linje. These two powerful arms came together, encircling most of Li Seung-man's four divisions. The enemy was like a ping-pong ball, those who fled south were blocked back to the north, and those who fled east were blocked back to the west. These lackeys cultivated by the American aggressors fled in all directions. The 1st Battalion of the 8th Regiment of the puppet 7th Division had just rushed to Baiziping when it was intercepted head-on by the volunteers. Volunteer Army 60mm mortar gunner Li Yunhan did not have time to set up the gun, so he clamped the barrel between his legs and fired; machine gunner Huang Chunlin stood and strafed. After twenty minutes, this battalion of puppet troops was annihilated. The vanguard of the puppet 3rd Division had just rushed to Cang Village when they encountered the volunteers who had been waiting for them and were immediately annihilated. Dozens of enemy trucks still transporting ammunition to the invading puppet troops encountered defeated puppet soldiers on the road, and the drivers abandoned their vehicles and fled in panic. On the battlefield of hundreds of li across the Zhao Yang River's south bank, there were puppet soldiers in groups of three or five, and hundreds of trucks loaded with ammunition and towing American artillery could be seen everywhere. After eating breakfast, the volunteer soldiers climbed the mountains to "pick up prisoners," and in the evening, they escorted down a large group. These prisoners did not know each other, and several dozen people included the designations of four divisions.

    The counter-offensive in May ended victoriously on the 21st. In five days of victorious fighting, the Korean and Chinese People's forces annihilated more than 17,000 enemy troops. When the American invading army rushed from the western front on the 22nd, they could only send empty mourning artillery fire for the lackeys who had already been annihilated.

### 五月的照阳江前线

　　五月的照阳江前线
       耐因
    一、向胜利疾进
    取得了四月大捷的朝、中人民部队，在五月中旬，乘敌人喘息未定之际，又跨过北汉江，把攻击矛头指向照阳江前线，展开了第二阶段的反击战。
    朝、中人民部队昼夜行军，向着胜利疾进。战士们愉快地把每天的宿营地称作“天亮里”、“太阳山”，荒山野坡就成了他们的“战地之家”。
    在进军途中，有时粮食蔬菜供应不上，战士们就到森林和荒山里去挖野菜吃。炊事员们也创造了各式各样改善伙食的办法。他们把黄豆敲碎做“菜豆腐”；把炒面调上整粒的苞米和野菜做成团子。战士们很幽默地把这种团子称做“战斗元宵”，又称做“抗美援朝三宝饭”。
    连续的急行军，使许多人脚走肿了，腿碰伤了。但是还有什么比消灭敌人更重要呢？共产党员单天明的脚在四月的反击战中被地雷炸伤了，听说又要去消灭敌人，他拒绝了一切劝告，坚持跟着队伍走。志愿军的英雄们涉过北汉江齐腰深的江水，攀登上耸立在云雾中的山峰，俯视着脚下起伏的群山，和一眼望不到头的正在向前线挺进的大军，他们挥着满脸汗水，兴奋地唱起快板来：“胜利就是比赛跑，要靠两腿立功劳！”
  二、尖刀直插一百二十里
    五月十六日十六时，从照阳江北岸志愿军炮兵阵地上发出了隆隆的攻击的炮声。从许多地点涉过江水的各路部队立刻像无数支利剑般刺向敌人。
    敌人的阻击丝毫也不能减低部队前进的速度。战士们有摔下沟去的，跌在河里的，可是他们爬起来跟着就跑。行列里重复着一个口令：“跑步前进！”“跑步前进！”排长于化文的脚被子弹射穿两个洞，鲜血流在鞋里，又印在地上。但他仍然咬着牙，跛着脚继续前进。
    那里有敌人，火力就投向那里。机枪手端着机枪射击，步枪手一面跑步一面压子弹。在水内里，敌人在两道铁丝网后面，展开了火力。共产党员傅庆祥振臂高呼：“共产党员们！青年团员们！这就是迎接考验的时候！”他提起炸药就冲上去。在爆炸声中，部队冲过去击溃了敌人。
    这支在黑夜里突然出现在敌人心脏里的队伍，弄得敌人口张目呆。许多伪军竟成排地站在路旁观望，直到自己被枪口顶住了胸膛才恍然醒悟，连忙举起手来。
    十七日五时十分，尖刀部队插到了预定目的地，截住了敌人的退路。一百二十里地一共花了十三小时又十分钟。他们不是走来的，而是翻越十几座山岭跑来的。支持着这超人的毅力的，只有一个英雄的意志：为了胜利！
  三、李伪军大溃败
    十七日夜晚，中国人民志愿军的部队与朝鲜人民军的部队在麟蹄东苍村地区胜利会师。这两条强大的手臂合拢来，把李承晚的四个师的大部围住了。敌人就像乒乓球一样，往南逃的被挡回北边去，往东逃的又被挡回西边去。这些由美国侵略者一手栽培出来的爪牙四散溃逃了。伪第七师第八团一营刚奔到柏子坪，就被志愿军当头截住。志愿军的六零炮手李云汉来不及把炮架好，两腿夹着炮筒就打；机枪射手黄春林站着扫射。经过二十分钟，这一营伪军就被歼灭了。伪第三师先头部队刚奔到苍村，就碰到早已等待着他们的志愿军，立刻就被歼灭了。还在给北犯伪军运送弹药的几十辆敌人的卡车，在路上遇到溃败下来的伪军，司机们抛掉汽车，落荒而逃。在照阳江南岸纵横百里的战场上，到处是三五成群的李伪军溃兵，到处可以看到上百辆满载弹药的和拖着美国大炮的卡车。志愿军的战士们吃完早饭就爬上山去“拣俘虏”，到黄昏时就押下来一大批。这些俘虏彼此都不认识，几十个人中间就包括了四个师的番号。
    五月的反击战到二十一日胜利结束。在五天胜利的战斗中，朝、中人民部队歼敌一万七千余人。当美国侵略军二十二日从西线赶到时，他们只能替已被歼灭的爪牙空鸣送丧的炮声了。
