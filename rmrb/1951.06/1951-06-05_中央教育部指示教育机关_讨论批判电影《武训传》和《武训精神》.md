Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The Central People's Government's Ministry of Education recently issued the following instructions regarding the launch of discussions and criticisms of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the "Spirit of Wu Xun":

　　1. The ideological debate triggered by the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has gradually developed into a nationwide ideological movement. This movement should attract the serious attention of all education workers in our country. Wu Xun, as a specific historical figure, is very familiar to the education circles in China. The so-called "Spirit of Wu Xun" has a profound and widespread influence among educators. This influence obscures the revolutionary stance and viewpoints, becoming a serious ideological obstacle to the advancement of the people's education cause. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth discussions of "The Life of Wu Xun" and related writings about Wu Xun in educational administrative organs and schools at all levels, and to conduct scientific and systematic discussions and criticisms of Wu Xun as a figure and the so-called "Spirit of Wu Xun."

　　2. Leading educational administrative organs at all levels should attach great importance to the leadership of this ideological movement. This movement must be widespread, reaching every school and every education worker. Educational administrative departments above the prefectural level and secondary schools and above should cooperate with the education trade union to organize and carry out this discussion. They should designate reference documents for reading, combine the film "The Life of Wu Xun" or Wu Xun's historical materials to conduct scientific research and criticism, and focus on examining their own thoughts, examining their past and present views on Wu Xun, and their views on the film "The Life of Wu Xun," using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons to conduct self-criticism, launch free debates, and encourage a few people to conduct more systematic and in-depth research, such as criticizing relevant works on Wu Xun and drawing scientific conclusions. For educational administrative cadres and primary school teachers below the county level, in addition to arranging self-study and discussions, the opportunity of vacation training can be used to conduct research on specific issues.

　　3. There must be correct ideological leadership in the discussion process, aiming at the issues raised, enlightening everyone's thoughts, going deeper step by step, from phenomenon to essence, and finally drawing correct conclusions, so as to clarify the revolutionary stance, viewpoints, and the boundaries of reactionary thoughts, eliminate the influence of the so-called "Spirit of Wu Xun," clarify the confusion in educational thought, and improve the political and ideological level of all education workers.

　　4. The study time is generally set for half a month. Educational administrative organs above the prefectural level and secondary schools and above must summarize and report the results of this study movement level by level before mid-July.

　　中央教育部指示教育机关
    讨论批判电影《武训传》和《武训精神》
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府教育部顷发布关于开展电影《武训传》和《武训精神》的讨论与批判的指示如下：
    一、由电影《武训传》所引起的思想论争，目前已逐渐开展成为一种全国性的思想运动。这一运动应引起我全国教育工作者的严重注意。武训这一具体历史人物，在我国教育界是很熟习的。所谓《武训精神》，在教育工作者中，影响极深也极普遍。这种影响模糊了革命的立场、观点，成为人民教育事业前进的严重的思想障碍。因此在各级教育行政机关及各级学校中深入讨论《武训传》及有关武训的论著，对武训这一人物及所谓《武训精神》进行科学的、系统的讨论与批判的工作，是十分必要的。
    二、各级教育行政领导机关应十分重视这一思想运动的领导。这一运动必须普遍到每一个学校每一个教育工作者。专署以上的教育行政部门及中等以上的学校，应协同教育工会组织开展这一讨论，要指定阅读的参考文件，结合电影《武训传》或武训的史料作科学的研究和批判，而重点应放在检讨自己的思想，就自己过去和现在对武训的看法，对电影《武训传》的看法，以马列主义、毛泽东思想为武器，进行检讨，展开自由论争，并提倡少数人作较系统的深入的研究，如批判有关武训的著作，作出科学的结论等。对县以下的教育行政干部及小学教师，除布置自学讨论外，并可利用假期集训的机会，作为专门问题进行研究。
    三、在讨论过程中必须有正确的思想领导，针对所提出的问题，启发大家的思想，步步深入，从现象到本质，最后作出正确的结论，以达到明确革命的立场、观点与反动思想的界线，肃清所谓《武训精神》的影响，澄清教育思想上的混乱状态，提高全体教育工作者的政治思想水平。
    四、学习时间，一般定为半个月。专署以上教育行政机关及中等以上学校，在七月中旬以前，必须将这一学习运动的结果逐级总结上报。
