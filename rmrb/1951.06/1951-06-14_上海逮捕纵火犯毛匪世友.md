　　Shanghai Arrests Arsonist, Bandit Mao Shiyou
　　The Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested arsonist Mao Shiyou on May 28th. This criminal set fire to a building at Lane 4, Tongji Road, near the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai at 12:45 am on May 27th. Fortunately, the fire was discovered and extinguished by the masses in time. After a rigorous investigation by the local public security organs and with the great assistance of the masses, Mao Shiyou was finally arrested on May 28th, and a bottle of sulfur was found on the spot. Mao Shiyou is from Binhai, Northern Jiangsu, 34 years old, and started as a bandit. After the Japanese surrendered, he joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and served as a squad leader in the "Homecoming Corps" in Funing County, Northern Jiangsu, using armed force to attack the people in the liberated areas, reversing land reform settlements, extracting rent, robbing and extorting, committing all kinds of evil. After the liberation of Funing, Mao fled to Shanghai and joined the Kuomintang bandit gang, continuing to commit evil along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After the complete liberation of mainland East China in 1949, Mao followed bandits like Feng Qizeng and Huang Bamei to Xiaoyangshan Island in Zhoushan, participating in the reactionary organization "Jiangsu-Zhejiang People's Anti-Communist Self-Defense Force." Later, he joined the bandit gang of Jin Asan, leading bandits in robbing merchant ships and committing murder for money at sea. After the liberation of Zhoushan, Mao sneaked into Shanghai alone, attempting to carry out sabotage activities. During the recent large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Mao not only did not surrender himself to the authorities, but instead set fire at night, harming the people's lives and property. After Mao was arrested, the local people have demanded that the government severely punish him according to the law. (Jie)

　　上海逮捕纵火犯毛匪世友
    上海市公安机关于五月二十八日捕获纵火犯毛匪世友。该犯于五月二十七日深夜十二时三刻，在上海市北四川路横浜桥附近同济路四弄弄内纵火，幸被群众及时发现扑灭。经当地公安机关严密侦缉和群众大力协助，终于在五月二十八日将毛匪世友逮捕，并当场搜出硫磺一瓶。毛匪世友，苏北滨海人，三十四岁，土匪出身。日寇投降后，投靠蒋匪帮，任苏北阜宁县“还乡团”班长，武装进攻解放区人民，倒算抽租，抢劫勒索，无恶不作。阜宁解放后，毛匪逃到上海，投入国民党匪帮，在江苏、浙江沿海一带继续作恶。一九四九年华东大陆全部解放后，毛匪又随封企曾、黄八妹等匪潜往舟山小羊山，参加反动组织“苏浙人民反共自卫纵队”。后又投至金阿三匪部，率匪徒在海上抢劫商船，杀人越货。舟山解放后，毛匪只身潜至上海，妄图进行破坏活动。在最近大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动中，毛匪不但不投案自首，反而黑夜纵火，损害人民生命财产。毛匪被捕后，当地人民纷纷要求政府依法予以严厉镇压。（解）
