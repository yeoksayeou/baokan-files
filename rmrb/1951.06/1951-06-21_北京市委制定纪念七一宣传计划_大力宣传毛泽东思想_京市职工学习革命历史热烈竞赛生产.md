[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated a propaganda plan on the 20th to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Party. The plan is as follows:

    I. The central content of the propaganda is the Party's revolutionary history and Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. Through such propaganda, further enhance the understanding of revolution, the Party, and the country among Party members and the working masses, and strengthen their revolutionary enthusiasm to continue to struggle for serving the people, for the public interest, for the future of the country, and for world peace.

    II. In the second half of June, Party members will focus on studying the articles written by leading comrades of the Party to commemorate "July 1st" and materials on Party history, and combine them with Chairman Mao's "On Practice" (already reported by Comrade Yang Xianzhen) and the People's Daily's critical articles on the film "The Life of Wu Xun" to conduct ideological self-examination on non-Marxist-Leninist—non-historical materialist positions, viewpoints, and ideological methods.

    III. Collect recollections of the Party's struggle history, recollections of revolutionary martyrs, model Party members, and the sacrifices and struggles of Party organizations from cadres and Party members. At the same time, carry out revolutionary history propaganda and explanations through exhibitions, picture books, movies, etc., among workers and the working masses, and collect their self-narratives of the comparison before and after liberation and the process of understanding the Party and the revolution. Record these recollections and self-narratives in writing, sort them out, and submit them to newspapers for publication.

    IV. In addition to holding a city-wide Party member celebration of "July 1st" on the eve of "July 1st," factories, government agencies, and other branches may hold their own "July 1st" celebration meetings or discussion meetings according to their circumstances and conditions. Leading comrades of the Party will speak on revolutionary history and the nature of the Party as preparation for Party consolidation and education. If there are members of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages in these units, they should be welcomed to participate. In addition, the masses should be welcomed to participate voluntarily.

    V. The Beijing Evening News will publish a special page to publish articles such as recollections and self-narratives of Party members and the masses. Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, in addition to broadcasting live recordings of city-wide celebration meetings, will continuously broadcast the above-mentioned recollections and self-narratives from late June.

    VI. Reopen the revolutionary history exhibition; if possible, move the exhibition to Zhongshan Park or the Working People's Cultural Palace.

    VII. If revolutionary history picture albums or Chairman Mao's portraits can be published, they will be distributed to propagandists in each branch to explain to the masses.

    VIII. After "July 1st," mobilize Party reporters and propagandists to carry out regular propaganda work in conjunction with Party consolidation and the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaigns. Establish long-term education on the Communist Party and Communism.

[Report from this newspaper] Factories in Beijing are enthusiastically welcoming the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Communist Party organizations such as the Beijing Machine Factory and the Beijing Postal Administration have decided to conduct education on the 30-year struggle history of the Communist Party of China for all Communist Party members and all employees. The propagandists of the Beijing People's Printing Factory are now using the Communist Party of China and the Chinese Revolution as the content of their propaganda, so that all workers can more deeply understand the great contribution of the Communist Party of China to the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and understand the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Chinese working class. Now, among the broad masses of workers, it has become common practice to greet the Party's birthday with their own practical actions. Some are greeting "July 1st" by revising their patriotic covenants and earnestly implementing the patriotic covenants, and some are using the unfolding of enthusiastic patriotic labor competitions as a gift to the Party's birthday. In addition to enriching the patriotic covenant, the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant has also determined that June will be the month for fighting accidents. Up to now, the plant has guaranteed that no major accidents have occurred in nearly twenty days. The original planned coal consumption was 0.7, but it has now been reduced to 0.684. The No. 3 Branch of Beijing Machine Factory is taking the completion of 500 water carts ahead of schedule as a gift to greet the Party's birthday. In addition, a certain department of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau will complete the task of converting 500 No. 2 wall-mounted telephones to No. 3 desktop telephones. The Beijing Waterworks Company's Engineering Section will complete the 3,000-meter dry pipe in Chaoyangmen. The Beijing Postal Bureau will increase the production of 4 million catties of millet to donate to purchase airplanes and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers as a gift to the Party's birthday.

　　北京市委制定纪念七一宣传计划
    大力宣传毛泽东思想
    京市职工学习革命历史热烈竞赛生产
    【本报讯】中国共产党北京市委员会于二十日拟定纪念党的三十周年的宣传计划。该计划如下：
    一、宣传的中心内容是党的革命历史和马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想；通过这样的宣传，进一步提高党员和劳动群众对革命、对党、对国家的认识，加强他们为人民服务、为公共利益、国家前途、世界和平继续奋斗的革命积极性。
    二、六月下半月，党内学习集中于党的负责同志所写的纪念“七一”的论文和党史材料，并结合毛主席的“实践论”（已由杨献珍同志作报告）和人民日报关于电影武训传的批评文字，进行关于非马克思、列宁主义——非历史唯物主义的立场、观点和思想方法的思想检查。
    三、在干部和党员中收集对党的斗争历史的回忆、对革命烈士模范党员和党的组织牺牲奋斗的回忆，同时在工人、劳动群众中通过展览会、画片、电影等进行革命历史的宣传讲解，并收集他们对解放前后的比较、对党、对革命认识过程的自述。把这些回忆、自述用文字记录出来，加以整理，送报纸发表。
    四、除“七一”前夕举行全市性的党员庆祝“七一”大会外，工厂、机关和其他支部，根据情况和条件，可分别举行本单位的“七一”庆祝会或座谈会，由党的负责同志讲革命历史和党的性质等问题，作为整党教育的准备。这些庆祝会，如本单位有各民主党派和无党派民主人士时，应欢迎其参加，此外并应欢迎群众自愿参加。
    五、北京晚报增出专页，发表党员和群众的回忆自述等文字。北京人民广播电台除广播全市庆祝大会实况录音外，从六月下旬起，连续广播上述的回忆自述。
    六、重新开放革命历史展览会；可能时将展览会移到中山公园或劳动人民文化宫举行。
    七、革命历史的画册或毛主席画传如能出版，即分发各支部宣传员，向群众进行讲解。
    八、“七一”以后，动员党的报告员宣传员，结合整党和抗美援朝、镇压反革命等进行经常性的宣传工作。建立共产党与共产主义的长期教育。
    【本报讯】北京各工厂正在热烈地迎接中国共产党诞生三十周年纪念日。北京机器厂、北京邮政管理局等共产党的组织，确定即将对全体共产党员、全体职工，进行中国共产党三十年斗争史的教育。北京人民印刷厂的宣传员，现在以中国共产党与中国革命为宣传内容，这样就可以使全体工人更深刻地了解到中国共产党对中国人民革命事业的伟大贡献，毛主席的英明领导，并体会中国共产党与中国工人阶级的血肉关系。现在广大工人中间，已普遍地以自己的实际行动来迎接党的生日。有的以修改自己的爱国公约，认真执行爱国公约来迎接“七一”，有的以展开热烈的爱国主义劳动竞赛来作为对党生日的献礼。北京石景山发电厂除充实爱国公约外，并确定六月为反事故斗争月。截至目前止，该厂已保证了在将近二十天中没有重大事故发生。原计划煤耗○·七，现已降低到○·六八四。北京机器三分厂，以提前完成五百辆水车作为迎接党生日的献礼。此外北京电信局某部门以完成五百部二号墙机改为三号桌机的任务，北京自来水公司工务课以完成朝阳门三千公尺的干管，北京邮政局以增产四百万斤小米捐献购买飞机大炮，支援中国人民志愿军，来做为对党生日的献礼。
