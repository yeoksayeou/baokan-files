Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, June 22nd: A frontline special correspondent for this agency reports: From June 11th to 15th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers annihilated more than 8,000 enemy troops. Due to the brave and resourceful close collaboration between the Korean and Chinese People's forces, the enemy's adventurous offensive has been temporarily forced to halt during these five days. Although the activities of the U.S. Air Force have become even more rampant during these five days, the enemy has suffered even greater losses due to the active and heroic anti-aircraft fire of the Korean and Chinese People's forces. According to incomplete statistics, the Korean and Chinese People's forces shot down or damaged 26 enemy aircraft over the front lines alone, including 16 shot down. Broken down by aircraft type, there were 20 fighter planes, 1 reconnaissance plane, 2 bomber planes, and 3 command planes. Three enemy air force pilots were captured alive. In these five days, the Korean and Chinese People's forces also destroyed 32 enemy tanks, 6 vehicles, and 4 artillery pieces, and sank 2 enemy ships.

    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】本社前线特派记者报道：从六月十一日到十五日，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军又歼灭敌军八千多人。由于朝、中人民部队英勇机智地亲密协同作战，这五天中敌军的冒险进攻已经暂时被迫停顿下来。这五天中美国空军的活动虽然又猖獗起来，但由于朝、中人民部队积极英勇地对空射击，敌人遭到的损失也更为惨重。据不完全统计：朝、中人民部队仅在前线上空即击落、击伤敌机二十六架，其中被击落者十六架。如按飞机型种来分，则有二十架战斗机、一架侦察机、两架轰炸机和三架指挥机。敌空军驾驶员有三人被活捉。朝、中人民部队在五天中还击毁了敌军坦克三十二辆，汽车六辆，炮四门，并击沉敌船两艘。
