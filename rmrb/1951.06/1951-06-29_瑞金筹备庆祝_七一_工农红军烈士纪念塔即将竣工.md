    【新华社南昌二十八日电】第二次国内革命战争时期的中央民主政府所在地——江西瑞金县各界人民正积极筹备庆祝中国共产党的三十周年。中共瑞金县委会将于七月一日在城区举行庆祝大会。各区、乡的农民也将分别集会庆祝。毛主席居住过的叶坪和沙洲坝村的农民，还准备在“七一”为中国共产党祝寿，他们已经写好了祝贺信送给毛主席和中共瑞金县委会。为了纪念十年土地革命战争中光荣牺牲的中国共产党员和革命烈士，瑞金县人民正在城东人民广场上兴建一座高达五丈的“中国工农红军烈士纪念塔”，预定在“七一”竣工。
    中共瑞金县委会早在六月下旬就印发了大批有关“七一”的宣传材料，并组织了一千八百多个报告员和宣传员，向各地人民进行中国共产党斗争历史的宣传。各地群众在“七一”前夕，都集会座谈和回忆土地革命时期的事迹和经历。
    全县人民为了纪念“七一”，还发起了捐献“红色故都瑞金号”战斗机一架，以支援中国人民志愿军。
