　　The 17th article of the "Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries of the People's Republic of China" stipulates: "Those who commit crimes under these regulations may be deprived of their political rights and may have all or part of their property confiscated." At present, the judgments and handling of confiscation of counter-revolutionary property by local courts are not consistent. The following are unified principles:

　　(1) Counter-revolutionary criminals sentenced according to law may have all or part of their property confiscated, depending on the severity of their crimes. This shall be declared by the court in a judgment.

　　Confiscation of property may be applied as a separate penalty.

　　The scope of confiscation of all property includes all land, houses, grain, livestock, tools, materials, enterprises, claims, shares, deposits, cash, and other movable and immovable property actually owned by the criminal himself (referring to ownership under his own name, alias, pseudonym, or by borrowing the name of another person). The scope of confiscation of part of the property shall be determined by the court based on the specific circumstances of the case.

　　(2) When confiscating all the property of counter-revolutionary criminals, appropriate means of production and living should be retained for family members who live together but do not actively participate in counter-revolutionary activities so that they can maintain their livelihood. The property of family members who do not live with them or the property owned personally by family members who live with them shall not be confiscated.

　　The property of poor counter-revolutionary criminals shall not be confiscated.

　　Property used by counter-revolutionary criminals for crimes, even if not owned by them, may also be declared confiscated by the court.

　　(3) All property confiscated from counter-revolutionary criminals shall be handled by the People's Government.

　　After the confiscation of the property of counter-revolutionary criminals is approved and pronounced by the statutory authority, it shall be executed by the pronouncing court in conjunction with the local public security organ. After execution, it should be immediately handed over to the local People's Government for management and put forward disposal opinions, and reported to the People's Government above the county level for approval.

　　Confiscation of larger-scale enterprises should first be placed under the trusteeship of a designated agency by the local People's Government and continue to operate, and then reported to the People's Government above the province (city) for instructions on handling.

　　The confiscation of shares and property of counter-revolutionary criminals in enterprises shall be handled in accordance with the "Instructions on Confiscation of Property of War Criminals, Traitors, Bureaucratic Capitalists and Counter-Revolutionary Elements" of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.

　　(4) If the property of the people has been swallowed up, occupied or looted by counter-revolutionary criminals, and the original object is still there, it should be returned to the original owner after the original owner requests its return and it is verified to be true.

　　Legitimate debts owed by counter-revolutionary criminals that should be paid off from the confiscated property may be appropriately cleared and repaid within the limits of the confiscated property after the creditor requests and it is verified to be true.

　　(5) If other property that should be confiscated is discovered after the judgment declaring the total confiscation of the property of counter-revolutionary criminals, the confiscation may still be enforced.

　　(6) The property of counter-revolutionary criminals who are at large shall also be handled in accordance with these regulations.

　　政务院关于没收反革命罪犯财产的规定
    （一九五一年六月二十二日政务院第九十次政务会议通过）
    《中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例》第十七条规定：“犯本条例之罪者，得剥夺其政治权利，并得没收其财产之全部或一部”。现各地法庭在没收反革命财产的裁判及处理上，尚不一致。兹作统一的原则规定如下：
    （一）依法判刑的反革命罪犯，得按其罪刑轻重，酌情没收其财产的全部或一部。由法庭以判决宣告之。
    没收财产得作为单独适用的刑罚。
    没收全部财产的范围，包括罪犯本人实际所有（指用本名、化名、堂名及假借他人名义所有）一切土地、房屋、粮食、牲畜、工具、物资、企业、债权、股份、存款、现款及其他动产与不动产的全部。没收一部财产的范围，由法庭依据具体案情确定之。
    （二）没收反革命罪犯全部财产时，对其共同生活而未积极参预反革命活动的家属，应酌留生产资料与生活资料，使能维持生活。对于不与其共同生活的家属之财产或与其共同生活的家属个人之所有的财产，均不予没收。
    反革命罪犯之贫穷者，其财产不予没收。
    反革命罪犯用于犯罪的财物，虽不属其所有，亦得由法庭宣告没收。
    （三）没收反革命罪犯的一切财产，均归人民政府处理。
    没收反革命罪犯财产，经法定机关批准并宣判后，由宣判法庭会同当地公安机关执行。执行后应即交由当地人民政府掌管并提出处理意见，报请县以上人民政府核准处理。
    没收较大规模的企业，应先由当地人民政府指定机关代管，并继续经营，然后报请省（市）以上人民政府指示处理。
    没收反革命罪犯在企业中的股份和财产，应依中央人民政府政务院《关于没收战犯、汉奸、官僚资本家及反革命分子财产的指示》处理。
    （四）没收反革命罪犯财产中，如有被反革命罪犯侵吞、霸占或抢劫的人民财物，而原物仍在者，经原主请求返还，查明属实后，应退还原主。
    反革命罪犯所负的正当债务，应由没收的财产清偿者，经债权人请求并查明确实后，得在没收财产限度内适当清理偿还。
    （五）反革命罪犯的财产在判决宣告全部没收后，如再发现其他应予没收的财产时，仍得执行没收。
    （六）对于在逃反革命罪犯的财产，亦依本规定处理。
