Reader Letters
Readers Respond to Doubts About the Criticism of Wu Xun

Editor's Note: On June 1st, this column published some letters expressing dissent or doubt regarding the criticism of Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun." As of today, we have received forty-five reader letters criticizing the opinions of the doubters. We now publish four of them below. We hope readers will continue to write and participate in the discussion.

Wu Xun's Motive and Effect in "Establishing Schools" are Consistent

Comrade Editor:

In the "Reader Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 1st, the letters from Mr. Qi Ming, Mr. Dong Lu, Mr. Ye Chi, and others expressed disagreement or doubt about the criticism of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun." These letters share a common idea, which is that Wu Xun's motive for "establishing free schools" was good, therefore he cannot be completely negated.

Mr. Qi Ming said: "Wu Xun has been dead for over a hundred years (Note: Wu Xun died in 1896, only fifty-five years ago), and we have no way of knowing what his intentions were at the time." In fact, judging from Wu Xun's lifelong, ugly deeds, his intentions are not difficult to understand.

Wu Xun's life story shows that he was the most docile slave and effective accomplice of the feudal ruling class. Although Wu Xun was also oppressed by some landlords, he followed the rules and regulations of the feudal ruling order, kneeling and kowtowing to the landlord class, working for the landlord class "without a crowbar, without a set, without dry soil to pad the millstone." Wu Xun fanatically promoted feudal culture, selling "good books" such as "The Scripture of the Emperor Wenchang" and "Book of Secret Blessings," promoting "chastity," and praising "sitting in a sedan chair carried by eight people." After he gained the appreciation of the feudal rulers and squeezed into the ranks of the feudal ruling class, he used methods such as lending money at usurious rates, exploiting land rent, profiting from arranged marriages, and working as a housing broker to exploit peasants. Can it be imagined that such a thorough supporter of feudal rule, and later an exploiter riding on the backs of peasants, would establish schools for the sake of "poor people not being oppressed"? It is very clear! Wu Xun's establishment of schools, like his lifelong, ugly behavior, was to promote feudal culture, maintain feudal rule, and train more slaves like him for the feudal ruling class. Wu Xun's so-called "asceticism" and "perseverance" were only ugly behaviors of doing everything possible to ingratiate himself with the feudal ruling class in order to obtain a position to promote feudal culture that he did not have!

From the Empress Dowager Cixi to Chiang Kai-shek, this group of reactionary rulers understood Wu Xun's "bitter intentions" in "establishing schools" and appreciated his achievements in "establishing schools." Therefore, they did not hesitate to bestow the plaque of "Benevolent and Charitable," praised him as worthy of being a "role model for teachers," and even built ancestral temples and worshipped him, placing him in the temples of feudal rulers. Mr. Qi Ming and others also admit that Wu Xun's establishment of schools had the effect of "easing class struggle, paralyzing the people's thinking, and hindering the revolution," and "helping the ruling class as aides, assistants, and even accomplices," but they idealistically deny the effect and affirm Wu Xun's motives without any reason. This is self-contradictory.

In addition, some people are trying to use such a statement to overthrow the dialectical materialist unity of motive and effect to defend Wu Xun. They say: "Effect is not necessarily the standard for testing motive! Intentional homicide and manslaughter both kill people, but the motives are different!" Yes, the motive of manslaughter is not to kill; his killing is just a chance event. There are also chance events in history. However, Wu Xun's "establishing schools" for "thirty years as one day" had the effect of hindering the revolution and maintaining feudal rule; can it still be said that his motive was good, but he encountered a "thirty years as one day" accident against his wishes?

Finally, I think many of the questions raised by those who expressed doubt or disagreement with the criticism of Wu Xun have already been explained in many articles in the newspaper. I hope they will seriously read other people's opinions to make the discussion more in-depth.

Wu Xun "Established Schools" for the Landlord Class and for Himself

Comrade Editor:

After reading the "Opinions Suspecting the Criticism of Wu Xun and 'The Life of Wu Xun'" published in the "Reader Letters" column of your newspaper on June 1st, I further felt the deep poisoning of the "Wu Xun spirit," to the extent that there are some people who, after many articles criticizing Wu Xun and the "Wu Xun spirit" have been published in newspapers and magazines, and the question of whether the "Wu Xun spirit" is worth learning has been resolved, are still defending Wu Xun and the "Wu Xun spirit." The "reasons" held by the defenders are still nothing more than those few. For example, Mr. Qi Ming, as if realizing something, "discovered" that "the problem lies here": "Was Wu Xun for his own benefit?" Mr. Qi Ming believes that Wu Xun was not for his own benefit, therefore he believes that "Wu Xun is not a historical sinner." Mr. Dong Lu described Wu Xun like this: "In the long journey of establishing schools, he encountered many difficulties, and never felt discouraged or frustrated. This spirit of perseverance is combined with the establishment of schools..." Therefore, his conclusion is: Wu Xun "seems to have some merits." Mr. Ye Chi proposed "Wu Xun's intention to establish free schools is not improper," "choose the good and follow it," and so on. This series of "theories," no matter how they are said, are affirming Wu Xun and the "Wu Xun spirit."

First of all, it is necessary to clarify whether Wu Xun "established schools" for himself. I believe that Wu Xun "established schools" for the feudal class and also for himself. Many people have put forward Wu Xun's so-called "altruism," "asceticism," "greater self," and so on. Who did he benefit by benefiting "others"? What does his "greater self" refer to? "For poor children," that is a false image, that is deception; for the feudal rulers, that is the essence. Wu Xun's "greater self" refers to the landlord class. These principles have been explained a lot in historical materials, editorials and articles published in the People's Daily, I will not repeat them, please Mr. Dong Lu and others check the newspaper. I will only focus on pointing out here that Wu Xun's benefit to the feudal rulers at that time was also for his own benefit, and the two were completely consistent, because Wu Xun was standing on the side of the feudal rulers at that time. Many people are misled by Wu Xun's so-called "asceticism," just like some people were misled by the false benevolent face of the counter-revolutionary elements who had oppressed and murdered the people by pretending to "eat vegetarian food" and "do good deeds." These perpetrators and accomplices all have such a set of methods. Please see: After Wu Xun became a professional beggar, he did not engage in production, but took the fruits of the peasants' hard work for a year to run "free schools" serving the feudal class, desperately supporting the collapsing feudal society. Isn't this beneficial to the feudal class? Wu Xun made contributions to the rulers at that time and entered the temple of the feudal class. Isn't this beneficial to himself? What is there to "follow" in this "spirit of perseverance" for the enemy? Why is it "not to be blamed"? What is there to say that the "intention" of "promoting" the enemy's "learning" is "just"? The so-called "Wu Xun spirit" that is detached from class and material foundation does not exist. Wu Xun's "perseverance" and "perseverance" in doing everything possible to support the collapsing feudal society and serve the enemies of the people are reactionary, and everyone has the responsibility to "rise up and punish them."

Who Understands Revolution, Who Doesn't Understand Revolution?

Comrade Editor:

The "Reader Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 1st published Mr. Ye Chi's letter, which expressed uneasiness and concern about the newspaper publishing articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun." I now put forward a few points for discussion with Mr. Ye Chi.

1.  The evaluation of a historical figure should be based on the social environment in which they lived and the impact of their actions on social development, and should not be rigidly adhered to one point and come to a rash conclusion. What was the social environment in which Wu Xun lived? It was an era when the oppressed people could no longer bear the oppression and organized to resist the ruling class with practical actions. What was Wu Xun doing at that time? He used "illiteracy" to cover up class oppression and exploitation, and to blur the people's class hatred. Mr. Ye Chi believes that Wu Xun's "intention" to establish "free schools" of the ruling class's slave training class "is not improper," because he "established free schools for the vast majority of people to study." If that's the case, would Mr. Ye Chi also think that the U.S. imperialism's opening schools in China with the Chinese people's blood and sweat to carry out cultural aggression is also "not improper"? Could it be that Chiang Kai-shek's advocated "saving the country through reading" can also be considered "not improper"?

2.  Mr. Ye Chi said: "Wu Xun is illiterate, what does he understand about exploitation?" "What is revolution?" I think: The two "characters" of "exploitation" are indeed something that "scholars" can write and read, and most peasants do not recognize these two "characters." However, peasants understand very well what is called exploitation; they know who is the exploited and who is the exploiter; and it is precisely the "scholars" at that time who were unwilling to understand "what is called exploitation." The peasants know very well "what is called revolution." When they cannot tolerate the oppression and exploitation of the feudal ruling class, they will rise up and overthrow the oppressors and exploiters; and it is precisely those who think that it is "not in line with the trend" who do not understand the great significance of the Chinese people's revolution! Mr. Ye Chi concluded that "illiterate" people "do not understand what is called exploitation" and "what is revolution," which is not in line with the facts.

There is no Super-Class Education

Comrade Editor:

After reading the "Opinions Suspecting the Criticism of Wu Xun and 'The Life of Wu Xun'" published in the "Reader Letters" column of the People's Daily on June 1st, I feel that many confused thoughts are caused by the erroneous view of "education beyond class."

Education has a class nature and serves politics. But some people know nothing about this, such as Mr. Dong Lu, who believes that "establishing schools" is always good, and Wu Xun's "begging to establish schools" is even more "commendable"; and fundamentally does not ask what kind of "schools" Wu Xun is establishing, who benefits from it, and what is the impact on social development? Mr. Jie Qidu admits that Wu Xun's "establishing schools" created a group of rulers, large and small, for the feudal ruling class at that time; but he confused education with different ideological content, and generated many "problems" that he thought were. Wu Xun "established" "free schools" to maintain feudal rule in the period of feudal rule decline and peasant class revolution to ease class struggle, so it is reactionary and a historical sinner. Does it mean that everyone who "established schools" before liberation is not allowed? That should depend on what kind of "schools" are being established. The Yucai School established by Mr. Tao Xingzhi is anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist, so it is progressive.

Mr. Jie Qidu asked: "If there was no previous 'education', how could there be many revolutionary workers?" The formulation of this question is very confusing. Yes, many revolutionary workers today have received reactionary education. But the reason why they are revolutionary is because they accepted Marxism and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and it is definitely not the result of receiving reactionary education. For example, in Yanjing University, which was subjected to cultural aggression by U.S. imperialism in the past, many students were also revolutionaries. Obviously, these revolutionaries were educated by the Chinese Communist Party to participate in the revolution, and were definitely not educated by the imperialist Stuart Leighton.

　　读者来信
            读者们回答对武训批判的怀疑
    编者按：六月一日本栏发表了一部分对批判武训表示异议或怀疑的来信后，到今天为止我们已接到四十五位读者的来信，批判了怀疑者的意见，现选载四篇于后。希望读者继续来信，参加讨论。
     武训“兴学”的动机和效果是一致的编辑同志：
    人民日报六月一日“读者来信”栏发表了弃名、董鲁、野痴等先生对批评武训和“武训传”表示异议或怀疑的来信。这些来信中有着一个共同的意见，就是武训“兴义学”的动机是好的，因此不能完全否定。
    弃名先生说：“武训死了一百多年了（按：武训死在一八九六年，距今仅五十五年），我们无法了解他当时的居心为何。”其实，从武训一生的丑恶事迹来看，他的居心是不难了解的。
    武训的一生事迹说明，他是封建统治阶级最驯顺的奴才和得力的帮凶。武训虽然也受过某些地主的欺压，但他却循规蹈矩地遵守着封建统治的秩序，向地主阶级下跪磕头，“不用格拉不用套，不用干土垫磨道”地为地主阶级干活。武训狂热地宣传封建文化，出卖《文昌帝君文》、《阴骘文》等“善书”，宣传“贞节”，颂扬“坐八抬大轿”。在他得到封建统治者的赏识而挤进封建统治阶级的行列里后，他又用放高利贷、剥削地租、包办婚姻取利、拉房纤等手段来剥削农民。这样一个彻头彻尾的封建统治的拥护者，而后来又是骑在农民头上的剥削者，难道可以设想，他会为了“穷人不受欺压”而兴学吗？事情很明白！武训的兴学，正和他一生的丑恶行为一样，是为了宣传封建文化，维护封建统治，替封建统治阶级训练更多的像他一样的奴才。武训的什么“苦行”、“坚毅精神”，也只是为了取得自己所没有的宣传封建文化的地位，而对封建统治阶级竭尽奴颜婢膝能事的丑恶行为吧了！
    从西太后到蒋介石，这一帮反动统治者很懂得武训“兴学”的苦心，并且赞赏他“兴学”的成绩；因而不惜赐以“乐善好施”匾额，赞为堪称“为人师表”甚至为他立祠祭祀，把他捧进封建统治者的庙堂。弃名先生等，也承认武训兴学起了“缓和阶级斗争，麻痹人民思想，对革命起阻碍作用”，“给统治阶级帮闲，帮忙，以至帮凶”的效果，但却又唯心地否认效果，毫无理由地肯定武训的动机。这是不能自圆其说的。
    此外，又有某些人企图用这样一种说法来推翻辩证唯物主义的动机与效果的统一论，来为武训辩护。他们说：“效果不一定是检验动机的标准呀！故意杀人与过失杀人一样杀了人，但动机却不一样呀！”是的，过失杀人者的动机并不是要杀人；他杀人只是一个偶然事件。历史上也是有偶然事件的。但是，武训“三十年如一日”来“兴学”，起了阻碍革命，维护封建统治的效果；难道还可以说，他的动机是好的，但却“事与愿违”而碰上了“三十年如一日”的偶然吗？
    最后，我觉得有许多对批判武训表示怀疑或异议者所提出的问题，报纸上许多文章都已说明过。希望他们认真地阅读旁人的意见，以使讨论更深入地开展。
                                                 仲毅
            武训“兴学”是为了地主阶级也是为了他自己编辑同志：
    读了贵报六月一日读者来信栏所载“怀疑对武训和‘武训传’批评的意见”后，使我更进一步地感到“武训精神”流毒之深，以至竟有这样一些人：在各地报纸、杂志发表了许多批判武训和“武训精神”的文章，“武训精神”是否值得学习的问题已经求得解决之后，仍然为武训辩护，为“武训精神”辩护。辩护者所持的“理由”，仍不过是那么几条。例如弃名先生，如有所悟似地，“发现”了“问题就在这儿”：“武训是不是为自己的利益？”弃名先生是认为武训不是为自己利益的，因之他认为“武训不是历史罪人”。董鲁先生这样描写武训：“在兴学的长途中，遇到了许多困难，从没有气馁或灰心丧气，这种坚毅的精神与兴学相结合……。”因之他的结论就是：武训“似有未可厚非的地方”。野痴先生则提出“武训兴义学，意非不正”，“择其善者而从之”等等。这一连串的“理论”，不管话是怎样讲法，都是肯定武训和“武训精神”的。
    首先要弄清，武训“兴学”是不是为了自己。我认为，武训“兴学”是为了封建阶级，也是为了他自己。很多人曾提出武训的所谓“利他主义”、“苦行”、“大我”等等。利“他”，究竟是利了谁呢？他的“大我”是指的什么？“为了穷孩子”，那是假象，那是欺骗；为了封建统治者，却是实质。武训的“大我”，也就是指的地主阶级。这些道理，历史材料，人民日报发表的社论和文章中已讲的很多，我不重复了，请董鲁先生等查阅报纸即可。我这里只着重指出一点，即武训为了当时封建统治者的利益，也是为了他自己的利益，两者完全是一致的，因为武训是站在当时封建统治者一方面的。很多人为武训的所谓“苦行”所迷惑，就好像有些人，曾为压榨和残杀过人民的反革命分子装出“吃素”、“行善”的假善人面孔所迷惑一样。这些行凶者和帮凶者，都有这样一套办法。请看：武训成为职业乞丐之后，不从事生产，把农民一年辛苦所得果实，拿来办为封建阶级服务的“义学”，拚命支持将要崩溃的封建社会，这还不是对封建阶级有利吗？武训有功于当时的统治者，而进封建阶级的庙堂，这还不是对他自己有利吗？这种“坚毅精神”，为了敌人的“坚毅精神”又有什么“可从之”的地方呢？为什么又“不可以厚非呢”？这种“兴”敌人之“学”的“意旨”，又有什么“正当”之可言呢？一切脱离开阶级的、物质基础的所谓“武训精神”是不存在的。武训的想尽一切办法支持将要崩溃的封建社会，为人民的敌人服务的“坚毅精神”、“坚毅行动”是反动的，人人有“起而诛之”的责任的。
                                                     张少华
            谁懂得革命，谁不懂得革命？编辑同志：
    六月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了野痴先生的来信，对报纸登载有关批判“武训传”的文章感到不安与担忧。我现在提出几点意见与野痴先生来研究。
    一、对一个历史人物的评价，应该根据其所处的社会环境与其所作所为对社会发展的影响，而不应该死扣一点，妄下结论。武训所处的社会环境是怎样的呢？是受压迫的人民不堪再受压迫，而组织起来，用实际行动来反抗统治阶级的时代。武训当时干些什么勾当呢？他用“不识字”来掩饰阶级压迫与剥削，来模糊人民的阶级仇恨。野痴先生认为武训兴办统治阶级奴才训练班式的“义学”，“意非不正”，因为是“兴义学为广大人民都要读书”。这样说来，难道野痴先生也会认为美帝国主义用中国人民的血汗在中国开办学校进行文化侵略也是“意非不正”吗？难道对于蒋介石提倡的“读书救国”也可以认为“意非不正”吗？
    二、野痴先生说：“武训既不识字，他明白什么叫剥削？”“什么叫革命？”我觉得：“剥削”两个“字”确是“读书人”才会写会读，大多数农民确实不认识这两个“字”。可是农民们很懂得什么叫做剥削；知道谁是被剥削者，谁是剥削者；而恰恰正是当时“读书人”才是不愿意明白“什么叫做剥削”。农民们很知道“什么叫做革命”，他们在不能容忍封建统治阶级的压迫与剥削时，就会起来革压迫者、剥削者的命；而恰恰正是那些认为“不合潮流”的人们才是不懂得中国人民革命的伟大意义呢！野痴先生断定“不识字”的就“不明白什么叫做剥削”，“什么叫做革命”，这是不合事实的。
                                  时舫
        没有超阶级的教育编辑同志：
    读了六月一日人民日报“读者来信”栏所发表的怀疑对武训和“武训传”批评的意见，我觉得有许多混乱思想是由“教育超阶级论”这个错误观点引起的。
    教育是有阶级性的，是为政治服务的。但有些人却对此毫无所知，如董鲁先生就认为“兴学”总是好的，武训“行乞兴学”更是“难能可贵”；而根本不问武训兴的什么“学”，对谁有利，对社会发展的影响如何？解其渡先生承认武训的“兴学”给当时的封建统治阶级制造了一批大大小小的统治者；但他又把有着不同思想内容的教育混为一谈，而产生了很多他所认为的“问题”。武训在封建统治没落时期，农民阶级起来革命的时期，却“兴”维护封建统治的“义学”，来缓和阶级斗争，因此是反动的，是历史的罪人。是不是在解放前一切“兴学”的人都要不得了呢？那应该要看兴的什么“学”。陶行知先生兴办的育才学校，是反帝国主义、反封建主义的，因此是进步的。
    解其渡先生问：“如果没有从前的‘教育’，又怎能有很多革命工作者出现呢？”这个问题的提法是十分混乱的。是的，现在有许多革命工作者是受过反动教育的。但他们之所以革命，是因为他们接受了马克思主义、接受了中国共产党的领导的结果，决不是受反动教育的结果。譬如说：在过去美帝国主义对中国进行文化侵略的燕京大学，有许多学生也是革命者。很显然，这些革命者是受了中国共产党的教育而参加革命，决不是帝国主义分子司徒雷登教育出来的。
