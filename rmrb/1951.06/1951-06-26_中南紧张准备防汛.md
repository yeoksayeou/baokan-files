　　The rivers in the Central South Region have all entered the flood season. The flood prevention work along the rivers and lakes in Hubei, Hunan, and other provinces has become even more intense.

　　In order to protect the Jianghan Plain, 80,000 farmers in the central Hubei province have formed a strong emergency rescue and dike protection team. The team has already begun flood prevention drills. A large number of flood prevention materials such as sacks and grass bags have been prepared in the areas along the Yangtze and Han Rivers. These materials have been transported to various important dike and dangerous construction sections.

　　The people in the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake areas have built flood prevention sentry posts on the dikes and erected telephone lines. The farmers living near the dikes have universally organized emergency rescue teams and established dike protection covenants.

　　The people along the rivers in Guangdong have prepared more than 70,000 wooden stakes and a large number of grass bags, sacks, and other flood prevention materials. Many counties have put forward the slogan "Every household prepares a piece of flood prevention material, every family prepares for flood combat."

    为了保卫江汉平原，湖北省中部地区已有八万农民组成了一支坚强的抢险护堤队。该队已开始演习防汛。长江、汉水沿岸地区，已准备了大批的麻袋、草包等防汛器材，这些器材已经运到各个重要的堤防险工地段。
    洞庭湖和鄱阳湖地区的人民，都已在堤防上盖好了防汛的哨棚，架设了电话线。靠堤居住的农民普遍组织了抢险队，订立了护堤的公约。
    广东各河沿岸人民已准备好了七万多根木桩和大批草袋、麻袋等防汛器材。许多县都提出了“一户准备一件防汛器材，家家对洪水备战”的口号。
