Reactions to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to the People's Daily

Comrade Editor:

    Zhao Kejian, County Head of Yutian County, Hebei Province, Conducts Self-Criticism Regarding Suppression of Criticism
    On April 12th, the People's Daily published readers' opinions in the "Readers' Letters" column regarding my suppression of criticism. After repeatedly studying the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and other relevant reference documents, I have recognized my mistakes and the roots of my errors. Now, I am sending you my self-criticism.

    First, I lacked learning, especially theoretical learning. Therefore, political work was not carried out effectively, and my thinking failed to keep up with the development of the revolutionary situation. For example, I mistakenly believed that "reports should be reviewed by the Party Committee and critical articles should be approved by the criticized party." This is not in accordance with the provisions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications." I had not even read this important document in the past. Learning is the obligation of every Communist Party member, and I forgot this article stipulated in the Party Constitution. This is a concrete manifestation of a weak sense of organization.

    The second root of my error is that I had a bureaucratic work style and was not humble in accepting criticism. For example, regarding some criticisms of our county's work raised by Yu Ziqiang, which were published in the People's Daily on January 4th, I did not conduct a deep self-criticism at that time, always thinking that there were objective reasons. In particular, I believed that the critic should be responsible for certain shortcomings in the criticism, and I was unwilling to accept the criticism. As Comrade Stalin said: "If you demand that their criticism be 100% correct, then you will eliminate any possibility of criticism from below, any possibility of self-criticism." At the same time, I forgot the spirit of what Chairman Mao told us: "Say all you know, say it without reserve," "The speaker is not guilty, the listener should take it as a warning," and "Correct mistakes if you have committed them, and guard against them if you have not." As a result, I blamed the critic, creating the fact of suppressing criticism and hitting the critic. If this mistake continues, it will seriously harm the work.

    The third root of my error is the meddling of petty-bourgeois consciousness. I did not realize that the criticisms of governments at all levels published in the Party newspaper from below were for the purpose of improving work, and mistakenly thought that it was an "insult" to myself.

    In addition to requesting that the higher-level Party give me appropriate punishment for the above-mentioned errors, I have also made the following plan for future improvement: (1) Strengthen learning. In addition to personal efforts to study, I will also lead all staff members of the county government and various district governments to study diligently. (2) Establish a democratic work style, solicit the opinions of the people in various ways, and extensively carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    The Anyang Military Control Commission Conducts Self-Criticism Regarding Improper Style of Public Notices

Comrade Editor:

    The criticism by Comrade Wei Sheng in the "Readers' Letters" section of the People's Daily on April 18th regarding the insipid and inaccessible wording of the proclamations and notices issued by our Commission and the Anyang Public Security Bureau is correct.

    We used some outdated words and phrases that people do not understand in our proclamations, notices, and other documents, which shows that our mass viewpoint is not strong. The phrases cited by Comrade Wei Sheng, such as "致干咎戾" [zhì gān jiù lì - to bring about calamity], "为虎作伥" [wèi hǔ zuò chāng - to act as an accomplice to a tiger], and "助纣为虐" [zhù zhòu wéi nüè - to assist King Zhou in his tyranny], are clearly typical examples of officialese. After checking, we found that in the past, we often used meaning to cater to words, instead of making words serve meaning when writing documents. Our understanding of who the documents serve and what their effect is was unclear. This kind of writing style is unacceptable. We have decided to study Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art carefully and rectify our writing style. In the future, we will strive to make our documents easy to understand in order to achieve the goal of serving the people.

                                        Anyang Military Control Commission

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    河北玉田县长赵克俭关于压制批评的检讨编辑同志：
    四月十二日人民日报《读者来信》栏刊登了关于我压制批评的读者意见。经我反复学习中共中央《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定》以及其他有关参考文件后，我认识了自己的错误和犯错误的根源。现在，把我的检讨寄给你们。
    首先，我缺乏学习，尤其是缺乏理论学习。因此，政治不开展，思想跟不上革命形势的发展。例如：我错误地认为“写报道要经党委审查，批评稿件要经被批评者同意”。这是不合乎党中央《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定》中的规定的。这个重要文件，我过去竟没有看。学习是每个共产党员的义务，我忘掉了党章中所规定的这一条。这是组织观念不强的具体表现。
    犯错误的第二个根源是：有官僚主义作风，在接受批评上不虚心。如一月四日人民日报所发表的郁自强对我县工作提出的一些批评，那时我未作深刻检讨，总认为是有客观原因的。尤其是认为批评中的某些缺点应由批评者负责，而不愿接受批评。正如斯大林同志所说的：“如果你们要求他们的批评百分之百正确，那末你们就会消灭任何来自下面的批评的可能性、任何自我批评的可能性。”同时也忘掉了毛主席所告诉我们的“知无不言，言无不尽”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”的精神，因而责备批评者，造成压制批评的事实，打击了批评者。这一错误如继续下去，对工作会有严重的损害。
    犯错误的第三个根源是：小资产阶级意识的作怪。没有认识到党报所登载的自下而来的对各级政府的批评是为了改进工作，错误地认为是对自己的“侮辱”。
    我对上述错误，除要求上级党给我适当处分外，并做出今后改进计划如下：（一）加强学习。除个人努力学习外，并领导县政府及各区政府所有的工作人员也努力学习。（二）树立民主作风，多方征求人民群众的意见，广泛开展批评与自我批评。
                          河北玉田县县长  赵克俭
    安阳市军事管制委员会关于所发布告文风不正的检讨编辑同志：
    四月十八日人民日报《读者来信专页》所载蔚生同志对本会及安阳市公安局所出的布告、通告词句不通俗的批评，是正确的。
    我们在布告、通告等文件上，沿用一些使人们不懂的陈腐词句，这说明我们的群众观念不强。像蔚生同志所举的“致干咎戾”、“为虎作伥”、“助纣为虐”等词句，显然是官样文章的典型。经检查后，我们发觉过去我们写文件时，常常是拿意思去迁就文字，而不是使文字服从意思。我们对文件是为谁服务的及其效果如何，认识是不明确的。这种文风是要不得的。我们决定要好好学习毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，整顿文风。今后所写文件一定力求通俗易懂，以达到为人民服务的目的。
                                        安阳市军事管制委员会
