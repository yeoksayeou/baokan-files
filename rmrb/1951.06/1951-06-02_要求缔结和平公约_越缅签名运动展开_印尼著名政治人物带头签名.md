According to incomplete statistics, by the end of April, over 1,040,000 people in North Vietnam had signed the declaration. At mass meetings in many towns and villages, attendees signed by voting, unanimously supporting the Peace Pact Declaration.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, May 31st: The Burma Congress for the Support of World Peace officially launched a signature campaign on May 12th to demand the conclusion of a Peace Pact and oppose the rearmament of Japan. The congress issued a declaration calling on the people of Burma to unite and join hands with peace-loving people around the world, participate in signing the Peace Pact Declaration, and jointly defend lasting world peace. The ten district peace committees under the congress are actively engaged in collecting signatures. Over 59,000 signatures have already been collected in Rangoon. A spokesman for the district peace committee, in explaining the significance of the Peace Pact Declaration signature campaign at a press conference, particularly pointed out that the attempt to rearm Japan is an attempt to revive Fascism.

Sunayo said when signing: "We should do everything we can to support the peace movement. The conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers is extremely necessary for mankind."
