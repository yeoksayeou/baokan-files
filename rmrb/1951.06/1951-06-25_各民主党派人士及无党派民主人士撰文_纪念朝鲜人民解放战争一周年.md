Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: Personages from various democratic parties and non-party democrats have written articles commemorating the first anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War.

　　Luo Longji, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Democratic League Headquarters, explained that the gains of the Chinese and Korean people in the war against U.S. aggression over the past year are: First, the weakness of the U.S. imperialism itself and its accomplices, which appeared strong but were weak, has been thoroughly exposed; second, the unity of peace-loving people around the world has been strengthened, and the strength of the world peace camp has been enhanced; third, the crisis of a third world war has been postponed. Luo Longji continued: We must recognize that the war against U.S. aggression is an arduous struggle and, moreover, a long-term struggle. We must create victories year after year in this long-term struggle; we should work even harder day by day.

　　Shi Liang, a member of the Central Political Bureau of the Democratic League, said: The facts of the past year have proven that we have won victories not only internationally and domestically, militarily and politically, but also, in particular, a great victory in the ideological realm of all Chinese people. In the practical action of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the Chinese people have recognized the strength of their own people and the weakness of the enemy, thoroughly eliminated the malignant diseases of worshipping, being close to, and fearing the U.S., and established national self-esteem and self-confidence in despising, looking down upon, and hating the enemy.

　　Ma Yinchu of the China National Democratic Construction Association said: In the past eight or nine months, the Chinese and Korean people have been as closely linked as flesh and blood in battle, inseparable. Now the Korean People's Delegation has brought the deep friendship and firm will of 30 million Korean people. Let us shout: The Chinese and Korean people are one family, and we vow to fight to the end to win the final victory!

　　Zhang Xiruo, a non-party democrat of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: The struggle of the past year has led to three main conclusions: First, U.S. imperialism is indeed a paper tiger. Second, the performance and achievements of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are indeed shocking to the world. Third, although U.S. imperialism has been constantly defeated, it still refuses to admit defeat. Based on the experience of the past year, and with more various modern weapons in the future, we will definitely be able to completely crush the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism.

　　Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: The victory of the Korean people has great world significance. The Korean people's just war against U.S. aggression has received warm support from peace-loving people all over the world.

　　Situ Meitang of the China Zhi Gong Party said: Overseas Chinese have a common feeling: it is a great honor to be the people of China today. U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and also the mortal enemy of the overseas Chinese. We will donate aircraft, artillery, and tanks named "Overseas Chinese" as a gift for the first anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War.

　　Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said: As we commemorate the first anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War today, the people of the whole country must resolutely respond to the sacred call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, launch a patriotic pact movement, strive to donate aircraft and artillery, conscientiously do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled soldiers, and use more powerful actions to support the front to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors!

    纪念朝鲜人民解放战争一周年
    【新华社二十四日讯】各民主党派人士及无党派民主人士，撰文纪念朝鲜人民解放战争一周年。
    民主同盟总部宣传委员会主任罗隆基说明中朝两国人民在抗美战争中一年来的收获是：第一，彻底暴露了美帝国主义本身和其帮凶们外强中干的弱点；第二，加紧了世界爱好和平人民的团结，增强了世界和平阵营的力量；第三，推延了第三次世界大战的危机。罗隆基继称：我们必须认识抗美战争是艰苦的奋斗，更是长期的奋斗。我们要在这个长期的奋斗中，创造一年超过一年的胜利；我们更应有一天超过一天的努力。
    民主同盟中央政治局委员史良称：一年来的事实证明：我们不但在国际和国内、军事和政治上都打了胜仗，尤其是在我们全中国人民的思想领域上，打了一个极大的胜仗。中国人民在抗美援朝实际行动中，认识了人民自己力量的强大与敌人力量的脆弱，彻底地消除了崇美、亲美、恐美的恶性病，树立了蔑视、鄙视、仇视敌人的民族自尊心与自信心。
    民主建国会马寅初称：在过去八九个月中，中朝两国人民在战斗中血肉一般地结合不分离。现在朝鲜人民代表团带来了三千万朝鲜人民的深厚友谊与坚强意志，让我们高呼：中朝人民是一家，誓为争取最后胜利而战斗到底！
    中国人民政协无党派民主人士张奚若称：一年的斗争得出三个主要的结论，第一，美帝国主义的确是一个纸老虎。第二，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的表现和成就的确是震惊全世界的。第三，美帝国主义虽然不断被打败，但还不认输。根据一年来的经验，再加上今后有了更多的各种现代武器，我们一定能够彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策。
    中国农工民主党监察委员会主席彭泽民称：朝鲜人民的胜利，是有着伟大的世界意义的。朝鲜人民抗美的正义战争已经得到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈的支援。
    中国致公党司徒美堂称：华侨有个共同感觉：作为今日中国的人民，是极大的荣耀。美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，也是华侨的死敌。我们要捐献华侨号的飞机、大炮与坦克，作为朝鲜人民解放战争一周年的礼物。
    九三学社主席许德珩称：当我们纪念朝鲜人民解放战争一周年的今天，全国人民更要坚决响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的神圣号召，展开订立爱国公约运动，努力捐献飞机大炮，认真做好优待革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和残废军人的工作，用更有力的支援前线的行动来打败美帝国主义侵略者！
