Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 19th: According to TASS, the leadership of the Italian Communist Party recently held a meeting in Rome to discuss the results of the recent elections for the provincial and municipal councils in 57 provinces of Italy and the Sicilian Regional Assembly. Afterwards, a statement was published in "L'Unità" on the 17th, saying: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party is satisfied with the achievements of the left-wing democratic forces (Communists, Socialists, and independent democrats) in the election. These achievements are mainly reflected in the fact that the left-wing democratic forces obtained far more votes in this election than the People's Front in the April 1948 election. Despite the government and right-wing parties' intensified use of pressure and numerous conspiracies, the democratic forces still achieved such results, while the ruling parties lost many votes. Therefore, it can be asserted that voters have greatly turned to the left-wing parties that are steadfastly striving for freedom, labor, and peace. This is the first powerful blow by the people against the political monopolists of the Christian Democratic Party.

The statement then pointed out: The Christian Democratic Party lost a large number of votes and was only able to win in some municipal councils by relying on fraudulent election laws. This means that Italy has moved far away from the principles of democracy.

Finally, the statement emphasized: The progress of the left-wing democratic forces may now cause the ruling group of the Christian Democratic Party to strengthen pressure. This pressure is launched under the direction of the American imperialists, with the aim of intensifying war preparations. Therefore, the Communist Party leadership warns all citizens, especially all true democrats, to pay attention to this danger that has once been manifested, and to strive to make the government respect the constitution, safeguard the fundamental interests of labor, and defend national independence and peace. This goal can be achieved if efforts are started immediately after the election and continued, strengthening the activities of the democratic masses and consolidating the unity of the working people. To this end, the Communist Party leadership has decided to instruct the party's parliamentary group to question the government's illegal actions that restrict and infringe upon the people's freedom of election.

　　意共就地方选举结果发表声明
    人民阵线在反动派使用压力和玩弄阴谋下仍然取得重大成就，这是人民对反动集团的有力打击。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党领导机构日前在罗马举行会议，讨论最近意大利五十七省省、市政委员会和西西里区议会选举的结果。会后，于十七日在《团结报》上发表声明说：意大利共产党领导机构对左翼民主力量（共产党、社会党和独立民主分子）在选举中所取得的成就，表示满意。这些成就，主要表现在左翼民主力量在这次选举中所得的选票比人民阵线在一九四八年四月的选举中所得到的多得多。在政府和右翼党派变本加厉地使用压力和玩弄无数阴谋诡计之下，民主力量仍然获得这样的成就，而各执政党却失去了许多选票。因此，人们可以断言，选民已经大大地转向坚定不移地为自由、劳工、和平而努力奋斗的左翼党派了。这是人民对基督教民主党政治垄断者第一下有力的打击。
    声明接着指出：基督教民主党丧失了大量选票，只是靠着骗人的选举法，它才能在一些市政委员会中取得胜利。这就是说，意大利已经远离了民主的原则。
    最后，声明着重指出：左翼民主力量的进展，现在可能引起基督教民主党统治集团加强压力。这种压力是在美帝国主义者指使下发动的，目的是要加紧备战。因此，共产党领导机构向全体公民，尤其是全体真正的民主分子发出警告，请他们注意这种曾经一度表现出来的危险，并努力促使政府尊重宪法，保卫劳工的根本利益，保卫民族独立与和平。如果在选举之后马上开始努力，并且一直坚持下去，加强民主大众的活动，巩固劳动人民的团结，就可以达到这个目的。为此，共产党领导机构已决定训令党的议会党团，对政府限制和侵犯人民选举自由的非法行径提出质问。
