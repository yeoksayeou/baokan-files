Land Reform and the Development of National Industry and Commerce
    Zi Yaohua, Standing Committee Member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce

    In the past, the underdevelopment of Chinese industry and commerce had many causes. Generally speaking, there were two major reasons: one external and one internal. The two were intertwined, inextricably linked, and worked together to suppress the development of Chinese national industry and commerce. The so-called external reason was the imperialist aggression against China's economy, turning China into their colony, a large market for them to sell goods, export capital, plunder raw materials, extract cheap labor, and suck the blood of the Chinese people. They certainly did not want Chinese national industry and commerce to develop. Initially, it was British imperialism, followed by French imperialism and Japanese imperialism, and finally American imperialism, each more ferocious and ruthless than the last. These are ironclad facts of the past, which do not need to be elaborated on. The so-called internal reason was the feudal system that had oppressed the Chinese people for thousands of years. Especially the feudal landlords in the countryside, who occupied large amounts of land, did not engage in labor or production, but enjoyed the fruits of their tenants' labor through excessive exploitation of rent, receiving 80% or even 100% of the harvest. They also used "donkey rolling" high-interest loans to exploit all the labor income of poor peasants and hired laborers. In rural areas, people universally cried "bran and vegetables for half the year" (meaning they had to live on rice bran and vegetable leaves for half the year). In normal years, farmers had no food to eat and no clothes to wear. When there was a famine, people starved and wandered, parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, were either separated or died. The beautiful countryside was transformed into "parasites'" "land of ease." Not only were people other than industrialists and merchants unwilling to invest in industry and commerce, but even industrialists and merchants themselves, while engaged in industry and commerce, did not ultimately aim to develop industry and commerce, but rather used the money earned from industry and commerce to buy land. In this way, industry and commerce would certainly not expand and develop.

    Now, imperialism and its reactionary bureaucratic capitalist lackeys have been driven out of mainland China by the Chinese People's Liberation Army led by our wise leader Chairman Mao, so that these hordes of robbers who plundered and extracted the people's blood and sweat can no longer use "agreed tariffs," "most-favored-nation treatment," "consular jurisdiction," and the traitorous "Sino-US Commercial Treaty" to oppress Chinese national industry and commerce. However, if the internal cause of oppression of national industry and commerce, namely the feudal landlord class's land ownership based on feudal exploitation, is not thoroughly eradicated, then on the one hand, the upwardly mobile forces will still be constrained by the declining feudal forces, and national industry and commerce will still be trapped in a state of stagnation and backwardness. This situation may not be so obvious in areas where the countryside was liberated before the cities, and land reform was basically completed long ago, and industry and commerce have gradually begun to develop. However, in the vast areas of the country (with a total population of 310 million) where the countryside and cities were liberated simultaneously, the feudal land system was the biggest reason for the underdevelopment of industry and commerce before liberation. Therefore, during the land reform period after liberation, industry and commerce have had more or less involvement and disputes. For example, in Wuhan City in the Central South region, industrialists and merchants who were also landlords accounted for more than 80%, in Changsha City, industrialists and merchants who were also landlords accounted for more than 90%, and in small cities near the countryside, it was almost 100%. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the Central South Military and Political Committee promulgated a wise, correct, and timely measure, namely the ten articles of the "Decision on Handling Urban-Rural Relations during the Land Reform Period," and at the same time established "Urban-Rural Liaison Committees" and "Urban-Rural Liaison Offices" in various cities, to make reasonable and legal arrangements based on different local conditions, to protect urban industry and commerce. This fully illustrates the crux of the relatively backward state of industry and commerce in small and medium-sized cities and the government's painstaking efforts to protect industry and commerce from infringement. In fact, the Urban-Rural Liaison Offices in various parts of the Central South region have assisted the government in properly handling many disputes between landlords who were also industrialists and merchants and farmers, so that more than 80% of industrialists and merchants with land relations can operate with peace of mind, and have initially shown signs of development.

    Regarding the great task of land reform, based on my personal understanding gained from studying land reform in the Hunan region, I firmly believe that because the leaders at higher levels have led well, the cadres at lower levels have worked well, theory and practice are consistent, policies and actions are consistent, and the inside and outside are consistent, it thoroughly conforms to the basic reasons for land reform and implements the basic purpose of land reform. In particular, this large group of grassroots young working cadres with unlimited loyalty, strong confidence, extreme patience, and who have been tempered and trained, have accumulated several months of practical experience, and with the addition of summer studies, the land reform work after this autumn harvest will be done faster and better. Furthermore, seeing the new countryside after the completion of land reform, there is an entirely new and good atmosphere. After the farmers have been divided into fields, they are truly masters of their own affairs, busy applying fertilizer and tilling the fields, and joyfully welcoming spring plowing and production. This fully proves that once the rural productive forces are liberated, the farmers who have turned over greatly increase their enthusiasm for production, truly paving the way for the industrialization of New China. However, the result of the completion of land reform can be described as "joy and fear" for urban national industry and commerce -- joy for moving towards victory, and fear for moving towards victory.

    What is "joy"? It means that after the completion of land reform, the following benefits accrue to national industry and commerce:

    (1) After the completion of land reform, the farmers' enthusiasm for production is high, and agricultural production will inevitably develop greatly. Last year, the national grain production reached 240 billion jin, which led to the transformation from relying on grain imports for many years to grain exports. This year, the area of land reform is even wider, and grain production can be further increased. In addition, all agricultural products such as cash crops, export raw materials, and commercial grains will increase accordingly. This provides favorable conditions for the development of national industry and commerce.

    (2) After the completion of land reform, as agricultural products increase, the farmers' purchasing power will naturally increase accordingly. For example, in the Northeast region, because land reform has been completed long ago, the demand for urban industrial products is increasing day by day. Taking cotton cloth as an example, the sales of cotton cloth in 1947 were only 800,000 bolts, which increased to 1.2 million bolts in 1948, increased to 3.2 million bolts in 1949, and increased to 9 million bolts in 1950; and the quality required by farmers is also increasing every year, that is, from coarse to fine, from fine to patterned. In this way, industry and commerce will naturally prosper.

    (3) As many industrial raw materials and export goods, such as bristles, soybeans, feathers, tung oil, and tea, increase year by year, export trade will inevitably develop along with it. On the one hand, it can increase the quantity of import and export trade, and on the other hand, it can exchange for many machines and materials necessary for the country's industrialization, which can further promote the great advancement of industry and commerce.

    (4) Providing funds and labor for industry and commerce is also one of the favorable conditions. In terms of funds, the profits that industry and commerce themselves will obtain each year will no longer be used to "go home and buy land," but must be used for re-production and expansion of their own businesses; and in the future, farmers can also accumulate funds to invest in production businesses, and the source of funds that industry and commerce desire can become richer day by day. In terms of labor, after the completion of land reform, there will also be a surplus of rural labor. Chairman Mao once clearly instructed: "Farmers -- this is the predecessor of Chinese workers, and in the future, tens of millions of farmers will enter cities and factories. If China needs to build a strong national industry and build many modern cities, there must be a long process of transforming the rural population into the urban population." ("On the Coalition Government")

    Just based on the above points, isn't this great news for national industry and commerce? What is "fear"? It is the responsibility of the industrialists and merchants listed below, which cannot but be "fearful when facing things"!

    (1) How to do a good job in urban-rural mutual assistance. In the past, it is undeniable that cities served imperialism, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capital. Cities and the countryside were opposed to each other, and the South and the North were isolated. Now it is different. The first step of land reform is to meet the farmers' production and economic needs, and the second step is to expand urban-rural mutual assistance and improve the exchange of materials. Therefore, it is necessary to restore the old commercial network and create a new commercial network. It is necessary to ensure that the farmers' surplus grain, local products, mountain goods, industrial raw materials, etc. can be quickly and timely sold to cities, or organized for export; and the cities supply them with relatively cheap daily necessities and necessary production materials. Therefore, developing urban-rural trade and promoting the exchange of materials has become a major task for national industry and commerce in the current economic situation after land reform, especially in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

    (2) How to adapt to rural purchasing power. Due to the great increase in agricultural production after land reform, rural purchasing power will naturally increase. However, under the current situation of industry and commerce, the production speed of agricultural products is certainly faster than the production speed of industrial products. Therefore, a new situation has arisen, that is, whether there is sufficient supply of industrial products to the vast rural market, especially whether there is sufficient supply of production materials such as agricultural tools needed in agricultural production. Originally, rural purchasing power can also be divided into "necessary purchasing power" and "surplus purchasing power." Surplus purchasing power can also be alleviated by means of savings and other ways to absorb funds. However, for necessary purchasing power, there is only timely industrial products to meet it. Taking cotton cloth as an example, if the vast poor peasants and hired laborers want to make a pair of pants each, they will need a very large quantity. Therefore, how to enable farmers to sell local products in one hand and purchase the daily necessities they urgently need in the other hand to meet their necessary purchasing power is a problem that industry and commerce should pay special attention to. In particular, it is necessary to avoid expanding the scissors difference and causing "low grain prices to hurt farmers," and even more so to avoid打击打farmers' enthusiasm for production.

    (3) How industry and commerce should face the countryside and meet the real needs of farmers is another issue that deserves special attention. Urban industrialists and merchants, according to many years of habit, have been isolated from the countryside for a long time, and most of them do not serve the countryside. After the completion of land reform, the situation has undergone tremendous changes, and industry and commerce must promptly investigate and study, and for their own products, they must not only meet the needs of the majority of farmers, but also distinguish between the quantity needed and the urgency of the requirements. It is not possible to "build a car behind closed doors," and even less so to produce crudely. Taking agricultural tools as an example, the conditions in various regions are different, with mountainous areas, hilly areas, large plains, the Northeast and North China being different, North China and Central South being different, and paddy fields and dry land being different, and it is necessary to take into account all aspects.

    (4) Cities must lead and support the countryside. It is necessary to ensure that agricultural products and industrial raw materials, etc., are mutually suitable for production and sales, and also to unify specifications, maintain specifications, and improve quality. Of course, all of this is not the sole responsibility of national industrialists and merchants, and requires the leadership and promotion of the state-owned economy, but national industrialists and merchants also have major responsibilities to fulfill under the leadership of the state-owned economy.

    In general, the two major reasons—the two major enemies—that suppressed the inability of national industry and commerce to rise up, one has been defeated and forever driven out of mainland China, namely imperialism and its bureaucratic capitalist lackeys. One is being smoothly carried out for eradication and elimination, namely the feudal system, especially the feudal landlords. In the current economic situation, new situations have emerged, and new difficulties have arisen. National industrialists and merchants should attach importance to this new situation of moving towards production development, to overcome this new difficulty of moving towards victory. Since last year, the people's governments at all levels and the leading organs of the financial and economic departments throughout the country have attached great importance to the arduous task of urban-rural mutual assistance and material exchange. They have convened a series of large and small local product conferences and various forms of material exchange conferences to solve many production and sales problems between cities and cities, between rural areas and rural areas, and between cities and rural areas. Therefore, national industrialists and merchants should, without shirking their responsibility, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, first treat this work as a regular and major task by the local federations of industry and commerce. The federations of industry and commerce of provinces and counties, the federations of industry and commerce of provinces and provinces, the federations of industry and commerce of cities and cities, and the federations of industry and commerce of districts and districts should further closely and intricately connect, investigate and study each other, exchange experiences, report on situations to each other, organize visiting groups to each other, and give full play to their creativity to achieve "using what they have," "exchanging what they lack," "using what they have left over," and "supplementing what they are insufficient." Secondly, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, it is necessary to organize joint operations, joint purchases, joint transportation, joint sales, or agency operations, agency purchases, agency transportation, and agency sales. The business must be planned and step-by-step. On the one hand, transportation should be direct to avoid the losses and time economy of transshipment and unloading. On the other hand, technology should be improved in packaging, and research should be conducted on fire prevention, rain prevention, and mildew prevention. Especially in business, it is necessary to reduce the exploitation of middlemen and reduce costs. In addition, all localities must organize small industries, handicrafts, and peddlers in large and small townships, actively adapt to the actual needs of various localities, and guide and support their production development. If this is the case, it can continue to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production, increase agricultural production, and expand the sales of urban industrial products, and expand industrial production. Only in this way can we competently and happily welcome the new situation after land reform, "liberate rural productive forces, develop agricultural production, and pave the way for the industrialization of New China" (Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "Report on Land Reform Issues"), and move from developing production to developing production, and from victory to victory!

　　土地改革与民族工商业的发展
    天津工商联常务委员　资耀华
    过去中国工商业的不发展，原因固然很多，总的来说，不外两个大原因：一是外来的，一是内在的，两者又互为因果，千丝万缕，分工合作，压迫得中国民族工商业无法抬头。所谓外来的原因，就是帝国主义对中国经济的侵掠，把中国变成它们的殖民地，变成为它们推销商品、输出资本、掠夺原料、榨取廉价的劳动力、吸取中国人民血液的大市场。它们当然不愿意中国民族工商业发展。最初为英国帝国主义，次之为法国帝国主义与日本帝国主义，最后为美国帝国主义，一个比一个凶，一个比一个狠。这是过去铁的事实，已用不着细说。所谓内在的原因，就是数千年来的封建制度，压在中国人民的头上。尤其在农村中的封建地主，占有大量的土地，不事劳动，不事生产，用超额剥削的地租，坐享佃农收获物的八成甚至百分之一百，还用“驴打滚”的高利贷，剥削贫雇农的全部劳动所得，农村中普遍喊着“糠菜半年粮”（就是半年要靠米糠与菜草过活）。普通年成，农民就没饭吃，没衣穿。一遇荒年，就饥饿载道，流离失所，父母子女，兄弟夫妻，不是生离，就是死别，大好美丽的农村，悉变为“寄生虫”的“安乐乡”。不但工商业者以外的人，不愿意投资于工商业，即工商业者本身，虽经营工商业，并不是以发展工商业为最后目的，而是利用由工商业所赚的钱来购买田地。这样，工商业当然不会走向扩充与发展。
    现在帝国主义及其仆从的反动派官僚资本主义，已为我们英明领袖毛主席所领导的中国人民解放军，赶出了中国大陆，使这些成群结队的掠夺榨取人民血汗的强盗们，已不能再用“协定关税”，“最惠国待遇”，“领事裁判权”，以及卖国的“中美商约”等来压迫中国民族工商业。但是，压迫民族工商业的内在的原因，即地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，若不予以彻底地铲除，则一方可以自由向上发展的活动力还会被压迫下降的封建势力所牵制，民族工商业依然要陷于停滞与落后的阶段。这样的情况，在先解放乡村后解放城市的地区，土地改革早已基本完成，工商业已渐走向发展，或不感觉怎样明显；但在乡村与城市同时获得解放的全国大部地区（总人口三亿一千万），封建土地制度在解放前实为工商业不发展的最大原因。所以在解放后的土地改革期中，工商业就发生或多或少的牵连与纠纷。例如中南区的武汉市，工商业兼地主者要占百分之八十以上，长沙市，工商业兼地主者要占百分之九十以上，而邻近农村的小城市则几为百分之一百。所以中南军政委员会在今年年初，乃颁布了一项英明正确而及时的措施，即《关于在土地改革期间处理城乡关系的决定》的十条规约，同时并在各城市中设立“城乡联络委员会”和“城乡联络处”，依据各地不同的情况，作合理合法的处置，来保护城市工商业。这就充分说明了中小城市工商业比较落后的症结与政府保护工商业不受侵犯的苦心。而中南区各地城乡联络处实协助政府妥善地处理了很多地主兼工商业者和农民间的纠纷案件，使有土地关系的百分之八十以上的工商业者，能够安心经营，并已初步呈现发展景象。
    关于土地改革这一个伟大的工作，依个人此次在湖南地区学习土地改革中所得的认识，深信由于上级首长领导得好，下级干部工作得好，理论与实践是一致，政策与行动是一致，里面与外面是一致，实彻底地符合了土地改革的基本理由与实行了土地改革的基本目的。尤其是这一大群有无限忠心，有坚强信心，有极度耐心，千锤百练的基层青年工作干部，积累了数月实地的经验，再加以暑期的学习，今年秋收后的土地改革工作，相信会做得更快，搞得更好。再看到土地改革完成后的新农村，更出现了焕然一新的好气象。农民在分得田地后，正是当家作主人，忙着施肥耕田，兴修水利，欢欣鼓舞地迎接春耕生产。这就充分证实了农村生产力一旦获得解放，翻了身的农民，就大大地提高了生产积极性，真是为新中国工业化开辟了道路。但是土地改革完成后的结果，对于城市民族工商业，可谓是“一则以喜”——走向胜利的喜，也“一则以惧”——走向胜利的惧。
    何谓“一则以喜”呢？就是土地改革完成后，对于民族工商业有如下的利益：
    （一）土地改革完成，农民生产情绪高，农业生产必然要大大发展，全国粮食生产，去年已达二千四百亿斤，遂使多年来依赖粮食进口转变为粮食出口。今年土地改革面积更广，粮食更可增产。此外，如经济作物，出口原料，商品粮等一切农业产品都会随之增加。这就为民族工商业供给有利的发展条件。
    （二）土地改革完成后，农业产品增加，农民购买力自然随之增加。例如东北区因土地改革早已完成，所以对于城市工业产品，需要日增，即以纱布一项而言，一九四七年销售棉布不过八十万匹，一九四八年增至一百二十万匹，一九四九年增至三百二十万匹，一九五○年竟增至九百万匹；而且农民要求的品质，亦每年增高，即由粗而到细，由细而到花。这样，工商业当然就跟着繁荣。
    （三）许多工业原料及出口物资，如猪鬃、大豆、羽毛、桐油、茶叶等既年年增加，出口贸易亦必跟着发展，一方固可增加进出口贸易的数量，一方更可换进许多本国工业化所必需的机器材料，更可促进工商业的大步前进。
    （四）提供工商业的资金与劳动力，亦更是有利条件之一。依资金而言，今后工商业本身，每年所获得的利益，再不会“回家买田”，一定要用到再生产与扩充本身事业上去；而将来农民亦可积累资金投到生产事业上去，工商业所渴望的资金来源，就可以日见丰富。依劳动力而言，土地改革完成后，农村劳动力亦有剩余，毛主席曾经很明确的指示过：“农民——这是中国工人的前身，将来还要有几千万农民进入城市，进入工厂。如果中国需要建设强大的民族工业，建设很多的近代式的大城市，就要有一个变农村人口为城市人口的长过程。”（《论联合政府》）
    仅就以上所举各点，还不是民族工商业的大喜讯吗？何谓“一则以惧”呢？就是如下所举工商业者的责任所在，不能不“临事而惧”了！
    （一）如何搞好城乡互助。过去的城市，无可讳言的是为帝国主义、封建地主及官僚资本服务。城市与农村是对立的，南方与北方是隔离的。现在不同了，土地改革第一步，是满足农民生产上与经济上的要求，而跟着第二步，就是扩大城乡互助与搞好物资交流，因此既要恢复旧的商业网，还要创造新的商业网。务使农民多余的粮食、土产、山货、工业原料等，能够很快地及时地推销到城市去，或者组织出口；并由城市供给他们比较便宜的生活必需品及生产必要的材料。所以，发展城乡贸易，促进物资交流，在土地改革后的当前经济形势中，尤其在抗美援朝运动中，就成了民族工商业的重大任务。
    （二）如何适应农村购买力。由于土地改革后农业生产大大提高，农村的购买力当然增加，然而农产品的生产速度，在目前工商业的现状下，当然要比工业生产品的速度快，因此，就发生一个新的情况，即有没有充分供应农村广大市场的工业产品，尤其是有没有充分供应农业生产中所需要的生产资料如农具等。本来农村购买力，还可分为“必需的购买力”与“剩余的购买力”。剩余购买力，还可用储蓄等吸收资金的方式来缓和。但对于必需的购买力，就只有及时地用工业产品来满足。即以纱布而言，广大的贫雇农，每一人要做一条裤子，就需要一个很大的数量。所以如何能使农民一手售出土产，一手就能购进他所迫切需要的生活用品而满足其必要购买力，乃工商业所特别注意的问题。尤其既不可扩大剪刀差而致“谷贱伤农”，更不可因此打击农民生产热情。
    （三）工商业如何面向农村而适合农民真正的要求，又是一个值得特别注意的问题。城市工商业者，根据多年习惯，城乡隔离已久，多半不是为农村服务。土地改革完成后，情势发生巨大转变，工商业就要及时调查研究，对于本身的生产品，既要适合农民大众的需求，还要分清需要数量与要求缓急。既不可“闭户造车”，更不可粗制滥造，即如农具一项而言，各地区情况就不同，有山岳地区，有丘陵地带，有大平原，东北与华北不同，华北与中南不同，水田与旱田又不同，非统筹兼顾不可。
    （四）城市要领导乡村与支援乡村。务使农业产品与工业原料等，既要产与销互相适合，还要统一规格，保持规格，改良品质。当然，这一切不是民族工商业者所能单独负责，还需国营经济领导推进，但民族工商业者，在国营经济领导之下，也有其应当尽的重大责任。
    总的来说，压迫民族工商业不能抬头的两大原因——两大敌人，一个是已经被打垮而永远被赶出中国大陆了，就是帝国主义与其仆从的官僚资本主义。一个是正在很顺利地进行铲除和消灭之中，就是封建制度尤其是封建地主。在当前经济形势中，出现了新的情况，发生了新的困难。民族工商业者就应当重视这个走向发展生产的新的情况，来克服这个走向胜利的新的困难。现全国各级人民政府及财政经济部门领导机关，从去年以来，已极端重视了城乡互助物资交流这一艰巨工作，曾经召集了一系列的大小土产会议及各种不同形式的物资交流会议，解决了不少城与城、乡与乡、城与乡的产销问题。所以民族工商业者，应当义不容辞地在国营经济领导之下，先由各地工商联合会，将这一工作视为经常重大任务，由省与县的工商联合会，省与省的工商联合会，市与市的工商联合会，区与区的工商联合会，进一步紧密地、交错地联系起来，互相调查研究，互相交流经验，互相通报情况，互相组织参观团，各自发挥其创造性，来达到“以其所有”，“易其所无”，“以其所余”，“补其不足”。其次，更须在国营经济领导之下，组织联营、联购、联运、联销或代营代购、代运代销。业务要有计划有步骤，一方在运输上务求直达而避免辗转起卸的损失与时间上的经济，一方在包装上改良技术，研究防火防雨防霉，尤其在经营上务期减少中间牙佃的剥削而降低成本。此外，各地还须将大小乡镇的小工业、手工业和小贩组织起来，积极地适应各地实际需要，来指导并扶助其生产发展。诚如是，则既可继续鼓励农民生产热忱，提高农业生产，更可打开城市工业产品的销路，而扩充工业生产。只有这样，才能胜任愉快地迎接土地改革后，“解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为新中国的工业化开辟道路”（刘少奇同志《关于土地改革问题的报告》）的新形势，才能从发展生产走向发展生产，从胜利走向胜利！
