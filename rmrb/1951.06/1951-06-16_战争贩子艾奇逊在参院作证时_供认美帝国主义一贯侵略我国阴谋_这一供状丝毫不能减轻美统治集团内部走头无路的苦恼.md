Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Following MacArthur and the American military leaders, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson testified from June 1st to 9th at a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate Military and Foreign Relations Committees investigating American Far East policy. In his testimony, Acheson nakedly confessed to the U.S. imperialism's consistent conspiracy to invade China, which it had been meticulously planning.

At the meeting, Acheson presented a so-called "Record of American Policy Toward China," totaling 425,000 words, to counter his opponents, showing that his counter-revolutionary degree was no less than theirs. In this "Record," Acheson explained that the U.S. government had consistently supported the Kuomintang reactionaries in suppressing the Chinese people's liberation cause after the war. Acheson said that the purpose of the U.S. policy toward China after Japan's surrender was to enable the Kuomintang government, which "had never controlled the entire China" and was then "confined to a small area in southwestern China," "to re-establish itself in those parts of China it had previously ruled and to enter for the first time those parts of China it had never ruled." To achieve this goal, the United States, on the one hand, sent Marshall to China for so-called "mediation," and on the other hand, intensified its military strengthening of the Kuomintang. However, Acheson lamented that "American aid itself cannot guarantee the survival of the government receiving American aid," and the Kuomintang government eventually collapsed. In this situation, U.S. imperialism directly pointed its military aggression at China. In explaining the instructions issued by the U.S. government to the American troops invading Korea, Acheson frankly admitted that the purpose of this army was "to make China fail and to make us succeed." He also specifically stated that in doing so, they were not restricted by geographical limitations such as the "38th parallel."

In his testimony, Acheson brazenly announced his determination to continue to occupy Taiwan by force and to cultivate Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit gang to oppose the Chinese people. Acheson said: "We have an obligation to ensure that Taiwan does not fall into the hands of the enemy (referring to the Chinese people) and we have an obligation to use military force to achieve this result." He also said: "Up to now, we have always recognized and supported this government (referring to the Kuomintang remnants)."

Despite Acheson's public announcement of this lawless aggression policy of U.S. imperialism, he could not help but deeply reveal the distress of U.S. imperialism's great ambitions but limited talents. Acheson admitted: It is "by no means an easy task" for the United States to defend Taiwan, and it is still "entirely possible" for the People's Liberation Army to successfully land in Taiwan. Regarding the future of the Korean War, Acheson raised a question: "How can the war be ended?" However, his own answer was: "No one can predict when the war will stop."

Thus, Acheson's lengthy testimony, in addition to further exposing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism before the people of the world, cannot alleviate the desperate plight of the U.S. ruling clique at all, and therefore immediately aroused sharp criticism. Senate Republican leader Taft said: "Acheson's testimony at the Senate Joint Committee was full of contradictions." Another Republican Senator, Bridges, said after listening to Acheson's testimony: The U.S. policy in Korea is: kill, kill, kill, but what the American people want to know is why the United States has lost 175,000 people in Korea and why the U.S. government does not have a plan to end this slaughter.

　　战争贩子艾奇逊在参院作证时        
    供认美帝国主义一贯侵略我国阴谋        
    这一供状丝毫不能减轻美统治集团内部走头无路的苦恼
    【新华社十五日讯】继麦克阿瑟和美国军事首脑之后，美国国务卿艾奇逊又自六月一日至九日在美国参院军事及外交两委员会调查美国远东政策的联席会议上作证。艾奇逊在作证中赤裸裸地供认了美帝国主义处心积虑侵略中国的一贯阴谋。
    艾奇逊在会上提出了一份长达四十二万五千字的所谓“美国对华政策回顾录”，以此来对付他的反对派，表明自己的反革命程度并不比他们差些。艾奇逊在这个“回顾录”中说明美国政府在战后一直都是支持国民党反动派镇压中国人民的解放事业。艾奇逊说，日本投降后美国对华政策的目的，是使“从未控制过整个中国”的、而且当时“局限在中国西南部的一个狭小区域内”的国民党政府，“能够重新立足于那些它以前曾统治过的中国地方，并能够第一次进入那些它以前从未统治过的中国地方”。为达到这个目的，美国一方面派遣马歇尔赴华进行所谓“调处”，一方面就加紧在军事上加强国民党。不过艾奇逊所引为悲哀的是“美援本身不能保证接受美援的政府的生存”，而国民党政府也还是最后垮了台。在这种情形下，美帝国主义就以其军事侵略的矛头直接指向中国。艾奇逊在说明关于美国政府发给侵朝美军的指示时，直认不讳地说这支军队的目的是“使中国失败，而使我们胜利。”他还特别说明在这样做的时候，他们不受“三八线”之类的地域限制。
    艾奇逊在作证中悍然宣布决心以武力继续霸占台湾，并培植蒋介石残余匪帮来反对中国人民。艾奇逊说：“我们有义务保证台湾不落于敌人（按指中国人民）手中，并有义务使用军事力量以达到这个结果。”他又说：“一直到现在，我们始终承认并且支持这个政府（指国民党残匪）。”
    尽管艾奇逊公开宣布了美帝国主义这种无法无天的侵略政策，但是他不能不深深地透露了美帝国主义志大才疏的苦闷。艾奇逊承认：美国要守得住台湾“完全不是一件容易的事情”，而且人民解放军成功地在台湾登陆仍然是“完全可能的”。关于侵朝战争的前途，艾奇逊提出了一个问题：“战争怎么样才能结束呢？”但是，他自己的答复是：“没有人能够预料战争何时能够停止。”
    这样，艾奇逊的冗长证词，除了在世界人民面前进一步暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本质而外，丝毫也不能减轻美国统治集团内部走头无路的苦恼，因此立刻招致了尖锐的讥评。参议院共和党领袖塔夫脱说：“艾奇逊在参院联席会议上的作证是矛盾百出的。”另一共和党参议员勃里奇在听完艾奇逊的作证后说：美国在朝鲜的政策就是：杀、杀、杀，然而美国人要知道的是为什么美国在朝鲜损失了十七万五千人，为什么美国政府没有一个结束这场屠杀的计划。
