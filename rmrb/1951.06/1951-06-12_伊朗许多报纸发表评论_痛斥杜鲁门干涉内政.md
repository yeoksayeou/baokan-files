Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 11th: Many Iranian newspapers have published commentaries denouncing Truman's actions in interfering in Iran's internal affairs.

Following the U.S. State Department's statement on May 18, which interfered in Iran's internal affairs, U.S. President Truman personally wrote a letter to Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh on June 1, blatantly interfering in the implementation of the Iranian oil nationalization bill. In the letter, Truman said that he represented the U.S. government in expressing "deep concern" about the current situation in Iran. He emphasized: "The supply of Iranian oil is absolutely necessary for the economy of the free world (i.e., the imperialist bloc)." Therefore, he requested the Iranian government to hold negotiations with Britain as soon as possible to resolve the oil issue. On the same day, Truman also notified British Prime Minister Attlee of this opinion. According to a British government spokesman, there was no difference of opinion between Truman and Attlee on this issue.

Iran's *Tolu* newspaper commented on Truman's letter, saying that the Tehran Parliament and political circles consider the letter another typical example of American interference in Iran's internal affairs.

*Bisui Ayamdi* newspaper said: Truman in his letter to Mossadegh "removed his mask, revealing the ugly face of American imperialism; this confirms its collusion with British plunderers." "Iran does not need any instructions, nor does it need the protection of Truman and his assistants. Iran has decided to abolish the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and drive the British agents and spies out of Iran; this decision must be realized. If Dr. Mossadegh evades his responsibility, he will face a severe and sharp struggle from the Iranian people."

*Bisui Ayamdi* newspaper said: Truman has not frightened the Iranian people. Truman can be sure that just as the Iranian people are not afraid of Morrison's "paratroopers and landing forces," the Iranian people are also not afraid of Truman's intimidation.

　　伊朗许多报纸发表评论        
    痛斥杜鲁门干涉内政
    【新华社十一日讯】德黑兰讯：伊朗许多报纸都发表评论，痛斥杜鲁门干涉伊朗内政的行动。
    美国国务院在五月十八日发表干涉伊朗内政的声明后，美国总统杜鲁门又于六月一日亲自写信给伊朗首相摩萨台，赤裸裸地干涉伊朗石油国有化法案的执行。杜鲁门在信里说，他代表美国政府对目前伊朗国内的情势，表示“深切的关怀”。他强调说：“伊朗石油的供应对于自由世界（按即帝国主义集团）的经济是绝对必要的。”因此，他要求伊朗政府尽早和英国举行谈判，以解决石油问题。同日，杜鲁门还将此意见通知英国首相艾德礼。据英国政府发言人说：对于这个问题，杜鲁门和艾德礼之间，没有意见分歧。
    伊朗《吐鲁报》在评论杜鲁门的信时说：德黑兰议会与政界人士认为这封信是美国干涉伊朗内政的又一个典型事例。
    《比苏·阿杨第报》说：杜鲁门在致摩萨台的信中“卸下假面具，露出了美帝国主义的丑相；这证实了它与英国掠夺者狼狈为奸”。“伊朗不需要什么指示，不需要杜鲁门及其助手的保护。伊朗决定取消英伊石油公司，并把英国的代理人与间谍赶出伊朗去；这个决定一定要实现。如果摩萨台博士逃避他的职责，他将遭到伊朗人民严厉和尖锐的斗争。”
    《比苏·阿杨第报》说：杜鲁门没有吓倒伊朗人民。杜鲁门可以确信：正象伊朗人民不怕莫里逊的“伞兵与登陆部队”一样，伊朗人民也不怕杜鲁门的威吓。
