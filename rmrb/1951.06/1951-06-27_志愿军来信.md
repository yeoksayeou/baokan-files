Letters from the Chinese People's Volunteers

(I)
　　This is a letter from a volunteer comrade recently sent from the front to a comrade.
　　——Editor

　　×× Comrade:
　　Since we entered Korea, the people of the motherland have been caring for us and looking forward to us all the time. A large number of comfort bags and millions of letters of sympathy have truly given us great comfort.

　　The fighting at the front is fierce. Relying on their superior planes and artillery, the enemy bombard our positions day and night. The enemy's artillery and bombs turned the snow-covered ground into scorched earth, but could not destroy the will of our soldiers. One comrade can hold a hilltop, and two comrades make the enemy feel as if they are facing a formidable foe. Comrades all say: "The enemy turns our positions from white to black, and we will turn the enemy's positions from white to red!"

　　Comrades have witnessed the enemy's atrocities in Korea with their own eyes. Every volunteer soldier fights bravely with a belly full of hatred. In one battle, soldier Jiang Shifu was seriously wounded and his leg was broken. The instructor asked him to go down, but he said: "Please rest assured, I will not disgrace Chairman Mao and the motherland. I will fight to my last breath to avenge the Korean people!" He pulled the fuse of a hand grenade, waiting for the enemy to rush up. On the Han River front, many soldiers' ears were deafened, but their eyes could still stare at the enemy; many soldiers' bodies were covered with the flames of gasoline bombs, but they knew that fire could also burn the arsonists to death, and they desperately hugged the enemy and burned to death together.

　　I have too much to say, but due to time constraints, I will only write this much this time. I hope that in the movement to resist America and aid Korea and love the country, you will strengthen your professional work, improve work efficiency, and contribute more to the people's revolutionary cause.

　　Chinese People's Volunteers, a certain unit, Engineering Battalion, Jin Pengfei

　　Below is a letter from a volunteer soldier to his brother, which was published in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily.
　　——Editor

　　× Brother:

　　On April 8th, when we were encamped in × village at the foot of the mountain, I received your letter.

　　We have been living on the Korean battlefield for almost half a year. Whenever our troops march, there are always many Korean old people and children staring at us with eager eyes, waving to us, and encouraging us to move forward; at the same time, we also receive countless letters of sympathy and comfort goods from the motherland, and also eat the sugar cubes sent by Hungary. All of these show that all peace-loving people in the world support our volunteer action to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our country!

　　Although we live in war, we are very happy in spirit. Thanks to the strength of our air defense forces, enemy aircraft dare not fly low to carry out wanton strafing and bombing, and the Chinese and Korean people's forces can safely and steadily arrive at the front line. On the morning of March 12th, several enemy light bombers attacked, and we immediately shot down one of them, and also destroyed another one. At noon, several enemy F-type Thunderbolt fighter planes suddenly swooped down and strafed our positions from behind the mountains. We calmly fired at them, and as a result, we hit the leading one again. You must have seen the victory of this day in the Jiefang Daily. According to the superiors, our unit alone shot down and damaged nineteen enemy planes!

　　Every time we march, we always see countless Korean people and compatriots from the motherland on the road, some are medical teams, some are stretcher teams, and some are transportation teams. They are all excellent sons and daughters who have rushed to the front line from various posts in order to fight the American aggressors and to resist America and aid Korea. They are with us, advancing tirelessly in the cold wind, snow and rainstorms, and on the rugged mountains. When our artillery columns advance side by side with them, and shout encouraging slogans to each other, or sing majestic songs, the atmosphere is truly infinitely exciting!

　　Chinese People's Volunteers, a certain unit, a certain company, Mao Huaigong

### 志愿军来信

　　志愿军来信
  （一）
    这是一位志愿军同志，最近从前线寄给一个同志的信。
    ——编者          ××同志：
    我们进入朝鲜以后，祖国的人民无时不在关怀着我们，盼望着我们。大批的慰问袋和千百万封慰问信，真使我们感到极大的安慰。
    前方的战斗是激烈的。敌人仗着优势的飞机大炮，日夜向我阵地轰击。敌人的大炮和炸弹把雪地打成焦土，但无法摧毁我们战士的意志。一个同志可以守住一个山头，两个同志就叫敌人如面临大敌。同志们都说：“敌人把我们的阵地由白的变成黑的，我们就要把敌人的阵地由白的变成红的！”
    同志们亲眼看到敌人在朝鲜的暴行。每个志愿军战士都怀着满腔的愤恨奋勇作战。战士姜士福在一次战斗中身负重伤，腿已被打断，指导员要他下去，他说：“请您放心，我不会给毛主席和祖国丢脸，我要拼最后一口气，为朝鲜人民报仇！”他拉响着手榴弹的火线，等待着冲上来的敌人。在汉江前线，多少战士的耳朵被震聋了，可是他们的眼睛还能瞅住敌人；多少战士的身上沾上了汽油弹的火焰，可是他们知道烈火同样可以烧死放火者，他们奋不顾身地抱住敌人，一同烧死。
    我要说的话太多了，由于时间的限制，这次只写到这里为止。希望你在抗美援朝爱国运动里面，加强你的业务工作，提高工作效率，好为人民革命事业贡献出更多的力量。

    下面是一位志愿军战士给他哥哥的一封信，曾在上海解放日报发表。
    ——编者          
  ×哥：
    四月八日那天，在山脚下的×村宿营时，得到你的来信。
    我们在朝鲜战场上，生活已经快半年了。每当我们部队行军时，总有许多朝鲜的老年人和小孩们以热望的眼光，凝视我们，向我们招手，鼓舞我们前进；同时，我们还收到无数来自祖国的慰问信和慰问品，也吃到匈牙利送来的方糖。这些都表明了，世界上所有爱好和平的人民都是支援我们抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动的！
    我们虽然生活在战争中，但精神上却很愉快。由于我防空部队的强大，敌机已不敢低飞肆行扫射轰炸，中朝人民部队得以平安地源源到达前线。三月十二日那天清晨，敌轻轰炸机多架来袭，我们当即打落其中一架，另外还击毁一架。到中午敌Ｆ型雷电式的战斗机多架，从高山后突然向我阵地俯冲扫射，我们沉着地予以射击，结果又击中其领头的一架。这一天的胜利你们一定在解放日报上看到了。据上级公布，仅我这一个单位便击落和击伤了敌机十九架呢！
    我们每次行军时，在公路上总看到无数的朝鲜人民和祖国的同胞，有的是医疗队，有的是担架队，有的是运输队。他们都是为了打击美国侵略者，为了抗美援朝，而从各个不同岗位奔到前线来的优秀儿女。他们和我们在一起，在寒冷的风、雪和暴雨中，在崎岖的山地上不停息地前进。当我们炮兵的行列与他们并列前进，而互相高喊出鼓励的口号，或者唱出雄壮的歌声时，那种空气真叫人无限兴奋！
