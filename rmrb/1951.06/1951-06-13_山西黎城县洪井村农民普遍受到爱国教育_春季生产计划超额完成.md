    Farmers in Hongjing Village, Licheng County, Shanxi Province, Universally Receive Patriotic Education
    Spring Production Plan Exceeded

Comrade Editor:
    In the past, most farmers in Hongjing Village, Licheng County, Shanxi Province, only understood that engaging in production was for personal wealth, and could not connect it with the interests of the country. Since the spring of this year, government and Party cadres have continuously conducted Resist-America, Aid-Korea education for the farmers, and the masses' patriotic ideology has gradually increased. All 294 people in our village who should have received Resist-America, Aid-Korea education have received it (only three shepherds often couldn't attend meetings, and our Party members also took the responsibility to publicize to them three times). In terms of propaganda and education methods, we used methods such as recalling, comparing, using past suffering to evoke present suffering, and denouncing the atrocities of Japanese invaders and the United States.
    After the Resist-America, Aid-Korea patriotic education, a fresh political atmosphere appeared in our village. The masses' enthusiasm for production increased. Six mutual aid teams in our village challenged Li Shunda, and all the mutual aid teams in the village also proposed to challenge the Shi Cunjin mutual aid team. In order to ensure the successful implementation of the masses' patriotic competition plan, on May 21st, our village established an evaluation committee and launched a mass "five comparisons" campaign – comparing leadership, comparing mutual assistance, comparing learning, comparing fertilizer, and comparing technology. At that time, according to the challenge and response conditions, we put forward the slogan: "What exactly are we completing? Let's compare it practically!" On the 22nd, our group first conducted evaluation and inspection. All 717 mu of wheat fields in the village have been hoed once, and the fertilizer application on the wheat fields has also been completed according to plan. A democratic summary and inspection was carried out on the work of mutual aid teams. Currently, out of 99 households in the village, only one household has not joined a mutual aid team. Zhang Niantang used to only care about himself and could not participate in the mutual aid team. After self-criticism, he joined the team and is performing very well. In terms of increasing fertilizer, the village originally planned to apply an average of 45 loads of fertilizer per mu, but it has now reached 49.5 loads. In terms of improving technology, the village originally planned to use two-legged plows for half of the land this year. As a result, out of 569 mu of grain fields, 458 mu used two-legged plows. The original plan was to use uncultivated fertilizer to improve 150 mu of soil, but 201 mu have now been improved. The original plan was to treat 70% of all seeds with warm water soaking and chemical dressing; it has now reached 84%. In terms of planting trees, the village originally planned to plant 190 trees and 482 timber trees; in reality, 2,809 trees were planted, exceeding the original plan by 2,137 trees. In order to consolidate and expand production and solve the special difficulties of mutual aid team members, 11 dan of public reserve grain was accumulated this spring. After democratic discussion, everyone decided to set aside 6% of the production this year as public reserve funds to purchase new agricultural tools.
    The reason why our village's spring plowing production work can exceed the original plan is that the masses have universally received Resist-America, Aid-Korea patriotic education, everyone has formulated patriotic production increase plans, and the challenge and response conditions have been thoroughly discussed by the masses. For each production item, it is possible to achieve leadership, arrangement, inspection, and summary.

### 山西黎城县洪井村农民普遍受到爱国教育  春季生产计划超额完成

　　山西黎城县洪井村农民普遍受到爱国教育        
    春季生产计划超额完成编辑同志：
    我们山西黎城县洪井村的大多数农民，过去只懂得搞生产是为了个人发家致富，还不能和国家利益联系起来。自今年春天以来，政府和党的干部不断地对农民进行了抗美援朝教育，群众的爱国主义思想逐步提高，我村应受到抗美援朝教育的二百九十四人都受到了教育（只有三个放羊的经常顾不上参加开会，我们党员也分工向他们宣传了三次），在宣传教育的方法上，我们运用了回忆、对比、以苦引苦，控诉日寇和美国暴行等方法。
    经过抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，我村出现了一种新鲜的政治空气。群众的生产积极性提高了，我村有六个互助组和李顺达应战，全村互助组又提出向石寸金互助组挑战。为了使群众的爱国主义竞赛计划圆满实现，五月二十一日我村成立了评比委员会，开展了群众性的五比运动——比领导、比互助、比学习、比肥料、比技术。当时根据挑战应战条件我们提出了“到底完成啥？实际比一下！”的口号。二十二日我组首先进行了评判检查。全村麦地七百一十七亩已普遍地锄了一次，麦地上肥料也完成了计划。在互助组工作方面进行了民主总结检查。现全村九十九户，只有一户未参加互助组。张拈堂过去光顾个人，参加不了互助组，经过检讨后入了组，表现也很好。在增加肥料上，全村原计划每亩平均上肥料四十五驮，现已达到四十九驮半。在提高技术上，今年全村原计划一半地用二条腿耧种，结果谷地五百六十九亩，用二条腿耧种的有四百五十八亩。原计划用荒肥改造土壤一百五十亩，现已改造了二百零一亩。原计划全部种子用温汤浸种和药剂拌种百分之七十；现已达到百分之八十四。在植树造林上，全村原计划栽树一百九十株、木料树四百八十二株；实栽树二千八百零九株，超过原计划二千一百三十七株。为了巩固和扩大生产以及解决互助组员的特殊困难，今春积了公积金粮食十一石。大家又经过民主讨论，决定今年要抽出生产物的百分之六作为公积金，以便购置新式农具。
    我村春耕生产工作所以能超过原订计划，是因为群众普遍受到了抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，大家都订了爱国增产计划，和挑战应战条件都经群众深入讨论。对每项生产都能做到有领导、有布置、有检查、有总结。
