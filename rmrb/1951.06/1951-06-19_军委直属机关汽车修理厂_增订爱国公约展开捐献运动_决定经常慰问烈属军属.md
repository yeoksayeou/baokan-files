Military Commission Directly Subordinate Organs Automobile Repair Factory
Revised Patriotic Pact, Launched Donation Drive
Decided to Regularly Comfort Families of Martyrs and Servicemen

To the Editor:
    Our staff at the Military Commission Directly Subordinate Organs Automobile Repair Factory have already taken practical action to respond to the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea's "Call to Promote Patriotic Pacts, Donate Airplanes and Cannons, and Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Martyrs and Servicemen."
    Seeing that the call mentioned that the Chinese People's Volunteers need more airplanes and cannons to eliminate more enemies and achieve the final victory of the war as soon as possible, comrades throughout the factory, led by comrades from Repair Shop Group 1, immediately started donating. In two hours, the entire factory staff donated a total of 727,000 RMB. Everyone also decided to combine this with revising the Patriotic Pact and donating more money by increasing production.
    After thorough discussion, each group revised its original Patriotic Pact. The four groups in the repair shop specifically proposed in their Patriotic Pact: In addition to completing the task of maintaining 60 vehicles, they would also repair one additional vehicle undergoing major overhaul and donate the surplus bonus. Comrades in the paint shop proposed in their Patriotic Pact: Guaranteeing the major overhaul of two vehicles and the patching of four vehicles each month, donating all surplus bonuses. Comrades in the forging shop proposed in their Patriotic Pact: On the condition of not affecting the original work, they would produce 300 various washers and donate all the bonus earned.
    After revising the Patriotic Pact, the work enthusiasm of comrades throughout the factory greatly increased. For example, Repair Shop Group 1 exceeded its quota by completing six minor vehicle repairs in one day. Repair Shop Group 4 rushed to repair five vehicles undergoing major overhaul in one day, increasing efficiency by more than 40% compared to the past.
    Repair Shop Groups 1 and 4 also included doing a good job in preferential treatment work into their Patriotic Pacts. They decided to allocate 20% of the monthly increased production bonus to comfort families of martyrs and servicemen. Group 4 also established a comfort team, which has already contacted the local police station and will regularly comfort families of martyrs and servicemen in the future.
    In order to ensure the implementation of the Patriotic Pact, the trade union has established an inspection system for the Patriotic Pact, stipulating that each group conduct inspections once a week to identify problems and correct deviations in a timely manner. The trade union holds joint meetings of inspectors from each group twice a month to understand the implementation of the Patriotic Pact in each group and provides a summary report to the comrades once a month.

    军委直属机关汽车修理厂
    增订爱国公约展开捐献运动
    决定经常慰问烈属军属编辑同志：
    我们军委直属机关汽车修理厂职工们，已经用实际行动来响应中国人民抗美援朝总会“关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召”。
    我们看到号召中提到中国人民志愿军为了消灭更多的敌人，早日取得战争的最后胜利，因而需要更多的飞机大炮。全厂同志由修理间第一组同志们带头，立刻进行捐献。在两小时内，全厂职工共捐献了人民币七十二万七千元。大家并决定要结合增订爱国公约，用增加生产来捐献更多的钱。
    经过充分的讨论，各组都增订了原有的爱国公约。修理间四个组在爱国公约中具体提出：除了完成保修六十辆车的任务外，并增修大修车一辆，把超额奖金捐献出来。漆工间同志在爱国公约中提出：保证每月大修两辆、凿补四辆，把超额奖金全部捐献出来。锻工间同志在爱国公约中提出在不影响原有工作的条件下，制作各种瓦拉三百个，所得奖金全部捐献。
    增订爱国公约后，全厂同志的工作积极性大为提高。如修理间第一组在一天内超额完成六辆小修车。修理间第四组一天内赶修了五辆大修车，效率比过去提高了百分之四十以上。
    修理间第一组和第四组把做好优抚工作也订入了爱国公约，他们决定把每月增产奖金抽出百分之二十用来慰问烈属军属。第四组并且建立了慰问组，他们已和派出所取得联系，今后将经常慰问烈属军属。
    为了保证爱国公约的实现，工会建立了爱国公约的检查制度，规定每小组每周进行检查一次，以求及时发现问题，纠正偏向；工会每月召开各组检查员联席会议二次，了解各组执行爱国公约情况，并且每月向同志们作一次总结报告。
