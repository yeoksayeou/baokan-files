　　I Feel Empowered Whenever I Think of the Party
    We Must Do a Good Job in the Defense Industry
    —A Letter from Model Worker Zhen Rongdian

Respected Chairman Mao:

The 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching. These thirty years have been the most magnificent era in China. In these thirty years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and yourself, we have overcome countless tortuous paths, surmounted all difficulties, and transformed the 475 million people of China from a state of slavery to masters of the country, from darkness to light. Chairman Mao, I first offer you and the Party my highest respect, celebrating the 30th anniversary of our Party.

The Party is like our parents to us, always caring for and nurturing us. I have been studying at the Ordnance Industry School for a year and a half, improving my cultural and political level, and learning courses such as Chinese language, mathematics, chemistry, drafting, and politics. Because of my own efforts and the enthusiastic help of teachers and classmates, I have made some progress. When I am studying, I often think: I am just an ordinary worker; it is because of the Party that I feel the glory of being a worker; it is because of the Party that I am able to have the opportunity to study. I deeply feel that the Party is truly the Party of our working class. Today, our country is engaged in a great construction project under the leadership of the Party. I feel even more keenly the great responsibility of the working class. When I am studying, I am also constantly thinking about the defense construction of our motherland, and we must do a good job in our defense industry so that the imperialists will never dare to invade us again!

The revolutionary situation is developing day by day, and the production tasks are becoming more and more demanding. My technical skills are not sufficient. I must improve my education, study technology hard, and do a better job in ordnance production, and never fail the Party's cultivation and education of me. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to support the front, we rushed to produce a lot of shells under extremely difficult conditions; but I feel that we were still not good enough in terms of technology and organizational management.

I have now been elected as the Chairman of the North China Regional Committee of the Chinese Ordnance Industry Trade Union. Due to the needs of the work, comrades want me to take on this job. I feel that I am still lacking, and I can only rely on the leadership of the Party. Whenever I think of the Party, I feel empowered. I will definitely study hard in my work and constantly improve myself.

The Resist America, Aid Korea movement is now developing vigorously, and the whole country is formulating patriotic pacts, donating airplanes, tanks, and artillery, and giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers. We are also actively participating in these three patriotic movements. I guarantee to do a good job in the work of accusation education, donation campaigns, and the formulation of patriotic pacts in the North China ordnance industry. Our ordnance factories are promoting the work experience of advanced factories. I guarantee to organize the study of trade union cadres well, and study together with comrades from the Party, the administration, and the Youth League, and further improve the work of our factories. In ordnance production, we must emphasize "quality first."

In terms of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, many counter-revolutionary elements have also been exposed in ordnance factories, and resolute suppression has been carried out. In the future, we must continue to carry out this work, thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, and purify our ordnance factories!

Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Party and yourself, I will definitely work actively and diligently and strive to build our strong defense industry.

I wish you eternal health!
            Zhen Rongdian

### 我一想到党就觉得有了力量  我们一定要把国防工业搞好——劳动模范甄荣典的信

　　我一想到党就觉得有了力量
    我们一定要把国防工业搞好
    ——劳动模范甄荣典的信敬爱的毛主席：
    党的三十周年快到来了。这三十年是中国最伟大的时代。这三十年中，由于中国共产党和你的领导，通过了无数曲折道路，战胜了一切困难，使中国四万万七千五百万人民，从奴隶地位变成了国家主人，从黑暗走到了光明。毛主席，我首先向你和党致以崇高的敬礼，庆贺我们党的三十周年纪念。
    党对我们就像父母一样，时时在关心培养我们。我在兵工学校已经学习了一年半的时间，提高了文化和政治水平，学习了国文、数学、化学、制图、政治等课程。因为我自己的努力和老师、同学们的热心帮助，我已有了些进步。当我在学习的时候，我时常在想念着：我是一个最普通的工人；因为有了党，我才感到工人的光荣；因为有了党，我才能够得到学习的机会。我深深地感觉到党真正是我们工人阶级的党。今天我们国家在党的领党下，正在从事着伟大的建设工程。我更感觉到工人阶级责任的重大。当我在学习时，我也时时想念着我们祖国的国防建设，一定要把我们的国防工业闹好，使帝国主义再也不敢侵犯我们！
    革命形势一天天的发展，生产任务一天天的紧张，我的技术感觉十分不够。我一定要提高文化，好好学习技术，把兵工生产做得更好，决不辜负党对我的培养和教育。在抗日战争中，我们为了支援前方，在极其困难的条件下，虽然赶制了不少的炮弹；但我觉得在技术上、在组织管理上还是很不够的。
    我现在被选为中国兵工工会华北区委员会主席。由于工作的需要，同志们要我来担任这个工作。我感觉自己还差，我只有依靠党的领导。我一想到党，就觉得有了力量。我一定在工作中好好学习，不断提高自己。
    现在抗美援朝运动正在蓬勃地开展，全国都在订立爱国公约，捐献飞机、坦克、大炮，优待烈属军属，我们也在积极参加这三项爱国运动。我保证把华北兵工中的控诉教育、捐献运动、订立爱国公约等工作做好。我们兵工各厂正在推广先进厂的工作经验。我保证把工会干部学习组织好，并和党、行政、青年团的同志们一起学习，把我们的工厂工作更提高一步。兵工生产上一定要强调“质量第一”。
    在镇压反革命工作方面，在兵工厂中也已检举出了不少反革命分子，进行了坚决的镇压。今后我们一定要继续进行这一工作，彻底肃清反革命分子，纯洁我们的兵工厂！
    毛主席，在党和你的领导下，我一定要积极努力做好工作，为建设我们强大的国防工业而努力。
    祝你永远健康！
            甄荣典
