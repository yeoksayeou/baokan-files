　　Love the Motherland, Love the Army, Conscientiously Do the Work of Substitute Farming
　　Director of the General Office of the North China Affairs Department of the Central People's Government, Bai Jian
            (I)
    After the efforts of 1949 and 1950, the substitute farming work in rural North China has generally overcome the phenomenon of random assignment of labor, and most areas have implemented a fixed substitute farming system or a work point system. Governments at all levels have also paid attention to organizing the production of military dependents (including families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, demobilized soldiers, and non-salaried staff, etc., hereinafter the same), and earnestly solving their difficulties in production and life. Therefore, the land yield of military dependents has generally increased, and some have reached or approached the level of ordinary people; the difficulties of military dependents have been reduced, and their lives have improved. Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, especially during the movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to military dependents during the Spring Festival this year, the masses have improved their ideas of loving the motherland, loving the army, and loving military dependents under the slogans of "The army is for the people, the people are for the army, mutual assistance is inseparable," and "Resist America, Aid Korea, do a good job in substitute farming." In addition to widely organizing the masses to comfort military dependents and holding symposiums for military dependents, Linxian County in Pingyuan Province also issued certificates and flags to model military dependents and model substitute farming households, and Sihai and other counties in Chahar Province held award ceremonies for model military dependents and substitute farming models. People's governments at all levels, as well as people's representative conferences at the county and district levels in many places, have generally inspected the substitute farming work, making the cultivation of military dependents' land much more timely than before. Most military dependents have also actively participated in agricultural and sideline production, and many military dependents labor models have emerged, which is also an important factor in gradually improving the production and life of military dependents.
    However, there are still many shortcomings in the substitute farming work. In some places, the backward method of temporary labor assignment is still used. According to surveys in Shanxi Province and thirteen counties including Xingtai in Hebei Province, this method still accounts for 20 percent of all villages. This method wastes both manpower and is prone to land abandonment. In some places, although a fixed substitute farming system has been implemented, the leadership has not inspected it and does not seriously solve problems such as fertilizer, so the yield cannot reach the proper level. In some places, not enough attention is paid to the personal difficulties of military dependents, and many problems cannot be solved in a timely and satisfactory manner.
    The root cause of these shortcomings is that the leading organs in some places do not pay enough attention to the substitute farming work, lack education for the masses, lack specific organizational work and inspection systems, and there is intolerable bureaucracy. As for some cadres, they show incorrect concepts such as "people help others when they are able to," reversing the importance of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, and judging things based on the person involved. It is hoped that the leading organs in various places will seriously inspect these phenomena in connection with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and thoroughly improve the substitute farming work.
            (II)
    How can we improve the substitute farming work?
    First, we must strengthen leadership and raise the patriotic consciousness of the broad masses of people. The serious attention of leading cadres is the decisive link. North China is an old liberated area with many military dependents. Whether from the perspective of consolidating the troops, supporting the war, or from the two aspects of the bumper harvest movement, we must do a good job in substitute farming. The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Armed Police. In order to defeat the enemies of the people, for the safety of the motherland and the happiness of the people, they do not hesitate to leave their homes, endure incomparable difficulties, fight heroically, and even become disabled or sacrifice themselves. Who is it for? Naturally, it is for the people. They have fulfilled the greatest responsibility and made the greatest contribution to the people of the whole country. Without the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers, the fruits of revolutionary victory, the security of the country, and the peaceful and happy life of the people would not be guaranteed. We must remember the source when we drink water. The people in the rear must be fully responsible for their families. Any lack of concern is wrong and must be corrected. As long as we care about them and do a good job in substitute farming, we can further encourage the morale of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers and eliminate more enemies; we can further encourage the morale of the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police and better consolidate national defense and revolutionary order. This is naturally one of the most practical tasks in doing a good job in resisting America and aiding Korea. In addition, the basic slogan of agricultural production this year is the patriotic bumper harvest movement, but if the land of military dependents is not cultivated well and the yield is reduced, the bumper harvest movement will be greatly affected, and the material strength of resisting America and aiding Korea will be weakened. Therefore, it is hoped that the leading organs in various places will seriously pay attention to the substitute farming work. Only when the leading organs pay attention can they seriously mobilize the masses, organize forces, and do a good job in substitute farming. It is obviously wrong to not inspect the leadership and only complain about the masses.
    Second, we should strive to improve the substitute farming methods and guarantee the substitute farming work from the system.
    First of all, all regions should eliminate the unplanned temporary labor assignment method without exception.
    Secondly, we should universally promote and improve the fixed substitute farming system. The advantages of this method are: 1. Strengthen the sense of responsibility of the substitute farmers; 2. The land of military dependents is not easy to be abandoned, and the life of military dependents can be guaranteed to a certain extent; 3. Substitute farmers can easily allocate time and will not waste manpower and animal power, delaying the farming season. Following the development of the contract farming method, many places have signed contracts between military dependents and substitute farmers, clearly stipulating the substitute farming responsibilities in the contract, which is not only conducive to the implementation of both parties, but also facilitates government inspection. Other methods such as large-scale contract farming (called small contract work in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province) and renting out for profit sharing can also be adopted in special circumstances for military dependents without any labor force.
    Again, the work point system and the method of exchanging labor for rice, which are generated on the basis of the contract farming system, have been adopted in many places. This method, on the one hand, can encourage substitute farmers to be willing to substitute farming, because more substitute farming can be exchanged for rice with work points, and those who are unwilling to substitute farming must pay rice to compensate for labor; on the other hand, it also encourages the enthusiasm of military dependents for labor production, which has been repeatedly proved by the experience of many places, because they can use more labor and less substitute farming labor to exchange the remaining work points for rice.
    Due to the development of the work point system, there has emerged a method of uniformly issuing work points and overall planning of substitute farming rice by district or county, which is beneficial to overcoming the imbalance in the substitute farming burden. Last year, many places in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Chahar provinces adopted this method. However, when adopting this method, those who substitute farming more are bound to still have the idea of "serving the government" because they cannot immediately get the rice back. Later, some places directly adopted the method of issuing rice first. The advantage is that substitute farmers can get rice as long as they get work points. But there is a problem, that is, traveling back and forth to transport rice is time-consuming and wastes labor. Therefore, Tangshan Prefecture this year further converted work points into cash and distributed them to military dependents in advance in spring and autumn. Military dependents, village cadres, and the vast majority of the masses are satisfied with this. The advantage of this method is that military dependents can easily hire labor in general. In addition, they can also use this cash to solve some production and living problems. However, the following issues must be considered: (1) The implementation of overall planning by county or district must have four conditions, that is, there has been a relatively accurate survey of the number of substitute farming mu in each village; there are reliable statistics on the labor and animal power that each village should contribute to substitute farming; the awareness of the masses has been improved, and localism has been overcome to some extent; the area is relatively rich, and the masses will not be affected by the collection of substitute farming grain for reproduction, and it is indeed voluntary by the masses. If all four conditions are not met and it is forcibly implemented, the masses may not accept it first, and it may also produce more unfair phenomena. (2) If the masses are willing to contribute labor and are unwilling or unable to pay cash, do not rashly implement the method of converting work points into rice or cash. (3) After the cash is issued, some military dependents may waste it, which must be prevented; in addition, it is also possible that people cannot be hired during the busy farming season or have to hire people at high prices, and military dependents will suffer instead. Therefore, when implementing this method, we should educate the masses well and ensure that military dependents can hire people on time and that the wages are fair.
    The above experience can be adopted by various places according to specific conditions, and should not be copied rigidly, nor should uniformity be forced.
    Third, military dependents have difficulties in firewood collection, manure accumulation, and sideline production due to the lack of labor; among them, fertilizer has a great impact on yield. Without solving the above problems, only doing a good job in the substitute farming system cannot completely solve the production difficulties of military dependents. Some places include some manure accumulation labor in the decision of substitute farming labor, and some places issue manure accumulation work points and miscellaneous work points. These methods can solve some problems. However, the local government must also give as much consideration and preferential treatment as possible to military dependents in terms of grain loans, loans, pre-purchase of cash crops (such as cotton and tobacco), lending soybean cakes, selling local products, and exchanging coarse grains for fine grains. In mutual aid groups and production cooperatives, efforts should be made to organize the women and semi-labor force of military dependents to participate in the production that they can participate in.
    Fourth, in order to implement the above tasks, the following measures must also be taken: (1) The rural patriotic conventions must include the content of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents and substitute farming, and regularly check its implementation. (2) People's organizations should assist the government in strengthening and improving the work of supporting the army and substitute farming. The people's representative conferences at all levels to be held recently should check the substitute farming work. (3) Improve the rural preferential treatment committee and give full play to its role to become a powerful organization for supervising and improving substitute farming work. (4) Reporters and propagandists must take supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents as one of the important and regular contents of propaganda.
            (III)
    At present, summer planting is busy, and it is also a new upsurge period of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. People's governments and people's organizations in various places should seize the time to organize forces and conduct in-depth inspections of the substitute farming work, especially in the old liberated areas with the largest number of military dependents. Places where substitute farming is not good should be remedied in a timely manner. There are many methods of inspection. In addition to cooperating with the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and sending special personnel to inspect, methods such as the Linxian and Sihai county award evaluation can also be adopted for inspection.

　　热爱祖国，热爱军队，认真作好代耕工作
    中央人民政府华北事务部办公厅主任　白坚
            （一）
    华北农村的代耕工作，经过一九四九年和一九五零年的努力，一般地区已克服了乱派工的现象，大部分地区实行了固定代耕制度或工票制度。各级人民政府也都注意了组织军属（包括烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、非薪金制工作人员的家属等，以下同）生产，并认真解决他们生产和生活中的困难。因此，军属的土地产量一般均有提高，有的已达到或接近一般群众的水平；军属的困难减少，生活有所改善。自抗美援朝运动展开后，特别是在今年春节时的拥护军队优待军属运动中，群众在“军为民，民为军，互助相连不能分”，“抗美援朝，做好代耕”等口号下，爱祖国、爱军队、爱军属的思想均有提高。各地广泛组织群众慰问军属，召开军属座谈会之外，平原省林县还给模范军属、模范代耕户发了奖状、奖旗，察哈尔省四海等县举行了模范军属和代耕模范的评奖大会。各地人民政府以及很多县、区的各界人民代表会议，均普遍检查了代耕工作，使军属土地的耕作，较前大为及时。大多数军属也都积极参加了农、副业生产，并出现了不少军属劳动模范，这也是使军属生产和生活逐渐改善的重要因素之一。
    但是，代耕工作中还有很多缺点。有些地方，仍然使用着落后的临时派工的办法。据山西全省，河北省邢台等十三县的调查，用这种办法的仍占全部村庄的百分之二十。这种办法既浪费民力，又易荒芜土地。有些地方虽实行了固定代耕制，但领导上未加以检查，不认真解决肥料等问题，因而产量尚不能达到应有的水平。也有些地方，对军属的切身困难关心不够，很多问题不能得到适时的和比较满意的解决。
    产生这些缺点的根本原因，是某些地方的领导机关对代耕工作重视不够，对群众教育差，缺乏具体的组织工作和检查制度，存在着不能容忍的官僚主义。至于某些干部，在实际工作中表现了“人在人情在”，将烈军工属倒置看待，以及看人办事等错误观念，更是不对的。对这些现象，希望各地领导机关结合抗美援朝运动认真加以检查，彻底改善代耕工作。
            （二）
    怎样才能改善代耕工作呢？
    第一、加强领导，提高广大群众的爱国主义的自觉。而领导干部的认真重视，又是决定的环节。华北是老解放区，军属较多，不论从巩固部队、支援战争，或从丰产运动两个方面出发，都必须把代耕工作做好。中国人民志愿军、人民解放军、人民公安部队的指战员。他们为了打倒人民的敌人，为了祖国的安全，人民的幸福，不惜背井离乡，忍受无比的困难，英勇奋斗，甚至残废、牺牲，是为了谁呢？自然是为了人民。他们对全国人民是尽了最大责任，有着最大贡献的。如果没有人民解放军和人民志愿军的英勇奋斗，革命的胜利果实，国家的安全，人民的和平幸福生活，都没有保障。饮水思源。后方人民对他们的家属是必须完全负责的，任何不够关心的现象都是错误的，必须纠正。只要我们关心他们，做好代耕工作，就可更加鼓舞志愿军指战员的情绪，更多地消灭敌人；就可以更加鼓舞人民解放军、公安部队指战员的情绪，更好地巩固国防，巩固革命秩序。这自然也就是做好了抗美援朝最实际的工作之一。另外，今年农业生产的基本口号是爱国丰产运动，但如果军属的土地，因耕作不好，产量降低，丰产运动就要受到很大影响，而削弱抗美援朝的物质力量。因此，希望各地领导机关，都能认真重视代耕工作。只有领导机关重视了，才能认真去动员群众，组织力量，把代耕工作搞好。不检查领导，只埋怨群众，显然是不对的。
    第二、应努力改进代耕办法，从制度上保证做好代耕工作。
    首先，一切地区，应当毫无例外地消灭无计划的临时派工办法。
    其次，普遍推行并改善固定代耕制。这种办法的优点是：一、加强代耕者的责任心；二、军属的土地不容易荒废，军属生活能够获得一定的保证；三、代耕人易于调配时间，不至浪费人力、畜力，耽误耕作季节。跟着包耕办法的发展，很多地方的军属与代耕人双方订立了合同，把代耕责任明白地规定在合同上，既利于双方实行，又便于政府检查。其他如大包耕（河北省沧县专区名为小包工），出租分收等办法，在特殊情况下，对于毫无劳动力的军属，也可以采用。
    再次，在包耕制基础上产生的工票制度和齐工找米的办法，已被很多地方采用。这种办法，一方面可以鼓励代耕人愿意代耕，因为多代耕可凭票换米，而不愿代耕的就要出米补工；另一方面也鼓励了军属劳动生产的积极性，这是很多地方的经验一再证明了的，因为自己多劳动，少用代耕工，可以把剩余的工票换米。
    由于工票制的发展，出现了以区或以县为单位的统发工票、统筹代耕米的办法，这对于克服代耕负担不平衡的现象是有好处的。去年河北、平原、察哈尔省不少地方已采用了这种办法。但采用这种办法，代耕多的人因不能马上找回米来，难免仍有“应差”思想。后来有的地方，直接采用先发米的办法，它的好处是代耕人只要拿到工票，就可以得到米。但有一个麻烦，即往返运米，既费时，又浪费劳动力。因此，唐山专区今年进一步将工票折成现款，分春、秋两季预先发给军属。军属、村干部及绝大多数群众均对此表示满意。这种办法，好处是在一般情况下军属容易雇到人工，此外，还可利用此项现款解决一些生产与生活问题。但有下列问题，必须考虑到：（一）实行以县或区为单位的统筹，必须具备四个条件，即各村代耕户代耕亩数已有比较精确的调查；各村应出代耕工的人力、畜力有了可靠的统计；群众觉悟提高，本位主义有所克服；地区较富，群众不致因征收代耕粮而影响再生产，且确为群众自愿。四条不备而强行，首先是群众可能不接受，其次也可能产生更不公平的现象。（二）以工票折米、折款的办法，如果群众愿意出人工，并不愿或出不起现款时，就不要贸然实行。（三）发了现款，某些军属很可能将它浪费掉，须加防止；另外，也有可能在农忙时雇不到人或不得不以高价雇人，军属反而吃亏。因此，实行这种办法时，应很好地教育群众，保证军属能够按时雇到人，而且工价公平。
    上述经验，各地当可根据具体条件采用，不要硬搬，也不要强求一致。
    第三、军属因为缺乏劳动力，所以在打柴、积肥、搞副业生产等方面均有困难；其中对产量有绝大影响的，就是肥料。不解决上述问题，光搞好代耕制度，还不能完全解决军属的生产困难。有的地方在决定代耕工时，包括了一些积肥工，有的地方发了积肥工票、杂活工票，这些办法都可解决一些问题。但当地政府还必须在贷粮、贷款、预购经济作物（如棉花、烟叶等）、出贷豆饼、推销土产、以粗粮换细粮等方面，尽量照顾和优待军属。在互助组、生产合作社等方面，应设法组织军属的妇女和半劳动力，参加可能参加的生产。
    第四、为了贯彻实现以上各项工作，还须采取如下办法：（一）农村的爱国公约，必须有拥军优属代耕的内容，并经常检查其实现程度。（二）人民团体应协助政府加强和改善拥军代耕工作。最近各地将要召开的各界人民代表会议，均应检查代耕工作。（三）健全农村优抚委员会，充分发挥其作用，成为督促与改进代耕工作的有力组织。（四）报告员、宣传员必须把拥军优属作为重要的经常的宣传内容之一。
            （三）
    目前夏种正忙，又值抗美援朝运动新的高潮时期，各地人民政府和人民团体应抓紧时间，组织力量，深入检查代耕工作，特别是军属数量最大的老解放区的代耕工作。凡是代耕不好的地方，应及时加以补救。检查的方法很多，除配合抗美援朝运动，派专人下去检查外，还可采取像林县、四海县评奖等办法进行检查。
