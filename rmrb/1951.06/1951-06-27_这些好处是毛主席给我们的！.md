　　These benefits are given to us by Chairman Mao!
Comrade Editor:
　　I am a pedicab worker. My wife, Zhang Zhixin, gave birth on June 5th. Because of a difficult labor, the fetus died in her womb. Her life was in extreme danger, and I wanted to send her to the hospital. But my daily income from pedaling the rickshaw is only enough to eat, how could I have money to pay for her medical treatment? The comrades of the Eighth Police Station of the Second District Public Security Bureau of Beijing Municipality learned of my difficulties and immediately introduced my wife to Peking University Hospital for free treatment. Peking University Hospital immediately performed an operation, opened her abdomen and removed the stillborn fetus, and my wife was out of danger. Now she has recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The people's police are so concerned about the suffering of the people, and the comrades of Peking University Hospital take care of the patients day and night without complaint. I will never forget these kindnesses. Recalling the era of Kuomintang rule, who would care about the difficulties of poor people like me? These benefits are all brought to us by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I am extremely grateful and have written this letter in the hope that you will publish it in the newspaper to express my gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Government.
　　Li Kanming, pedicab worker, No. 13 Wangye Buddha Hall, Erlong Road, Xidan

### 这些好处是毛主席给我们的！

　　这些好处是毛主席给我们的！编辑同志：
    我是一个三轮车工人。我的妻子张志信在六月五日生孩子，因为难产，胎儿死在腹内。她的生命已极端危险，我想把她送入医院。但我每日蹬三轮的收入，只够吃饭，那有钱给他看病呢？北京市第二区公安分局第八派出所同志知道了我的困难，立刻介绍我的妻子到北大医院免费治疗。北大医院当即施用手术，开腹取出死胎，我妻子才脱离危险。现在她已痊愈出院。人民警察这样关心人民的困苦，北大医院同志日夜不辞劳苦看护病人，这些恩情，使我没齿难忘。回忆在国民党统治时代，像我这种贫苦的人，有了困难，有谁来管呢？这样的好处都是共产党毛主席带给我们的。我感激万分，特写了这封信，希望你们登在报上，以表达我对共产党和人民政府的感激。
