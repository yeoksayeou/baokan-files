　　Beijing People's Art Theatre enthusiastically donates
    Music and dance benefit performance to be held today and tomorrow
    [By this newspaper] The Beijing People's Art Theatre, with its entire staff of over 400 members, actively participates in the movement to donate airplanes and cannons. Most of the staff members have already drawn up long-term donation plans. Jin Li and Xu Xifan of the theater's drama troupe have donated all the money they earned from teaching at the Beijing Amateur Art School. The theater held a donation benefit performance on the 10th of this month, and all the proceeds, after deducting necessary expenses, were remitted to the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles as funds for purchasing the "Lu Xun" airplane. In order to donate more, the theater has decided to hold another music and dance benefit performance at the Concert Hall at 8:00 PM on the 16th (Saturday) and 17th (Sunday) of this month. The program includes solo performances by Li Bo, Shi Yifu, Deng Ziqi, Mo Guixin, and folk music such as "Sawing the Big Jar" and nursery rhymes, as well as Russian folk duets, orchestral dances, and a small-scale song and dance drama "The Whole Family is Glorious," totaling more than 20 items. Ticket prices are divided into three types: general tickets at 3,000 and 5,000, and honorary tickets at 10,000. Group ticket purchases can enjoy a 20% discount. Tickets are available for advance purchase at the Concert Hall from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily.
