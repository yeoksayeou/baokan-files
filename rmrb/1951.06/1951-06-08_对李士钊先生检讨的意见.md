　　Opinions on Mr. Li Shizhao's Self-Criticism
            (I) Editor Comrades:
    After reading Mr. Li Shizhao's article "My Preliminary Understanding of the Error of Idolizing and Promoting Wu Xun," we feel that Mr. Li Shizhao has not conducted a self-criticism aimed at his own mistakes. At the beginning, the author listed a large number of "famous works" to explain that the reason he was like this was due to the influence of these works. Then, he attributed it to "many advanced patriotic democratic people, who also did not deeply analyze and connect 'Wu Xun' with the democratic political movement,... forming an erroneous understanding of him among cultural and educational circles and the people." In addition, he brought up "schools named after 'Wu Xun'" which "buried many revolutionary students and democratic teachers" to confuse people. What is even more unpardonable is that in the preface to his own *Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun*, the author clearly wrote: "The opinions of the screenwriter and director of the film Sun Yu are completely consistent with our position and viewpoint." But now, in his article, Mr. Li Shizhao criticizes the errors of Sun Yu, the screenwriter and director of the film *The Life of Wu Xun*, but he has not seriously criticized his own *Illustrated Biography of Wu Xun*. This attitude is dishonest.

    Let's look at the author's understanding of Wu Xun as a person. Although the author says that he "recognized the error of idolizing and promoting Wu Xun," Mr. Li Shizhao's understanding of Wu Xun is still wrong. Although he also cited the Guangming Daily editorial's statement that "Wu Xun was a supporter of feudal rule, a worshiper of the feudal system, and a supporter of feudal morality," he then said that "Wu Xun was basically a person without political activity." I think such a defense is unnecessary.

            (II) Editor Comrades:
    After reading Mr. Li Shizhao's article "My Preliminary Understanding of the Error of Idolizing and Promoting Wu Xun" published in the People's Daily on May 31, I believe that this self-criticism is not profound at all, and in some places, he is still defending the "spirit of Wu Xun." For example, Mr. Li Shizhao describes Wu Xun, a thorough lackey who served the reactionary ruling class, as "basically a person without political activity." Of course, Wu Xun would not have had any relationship with the revolutionary Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement. But at that time, he had a close relationship with the Manchu Qing government (the enemy of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the enemy of the working people). Isn't this reactionary political activity?

    Mr. Li Shizhao himself also said that in promoting the "spirit of Wu Xun," he "feared that it would not be deeply popularized, and constantly collected and excavated all the documents about him, and trimmed them, writing a 'biography' for him from before his death to after his death, intentionally deleting some of his backward views, such as the anti-scientific ideas of 'Yin Zhi' in his sayings, and avoided them, trying to write him as a 'great model of the working people'." According to Mr. Li's confession, is the reason for the error merely committing an "error of objectivism"?

    I hope that Mr. Li Shizhao will not just circle around Wu Xun's personal or certain historical facts, but should conduct a self-criticism in connection with his own thinking.

### 对李士钊先生检讨的意见

　　对李士钊先生检讨的意见
            （一）编辑同志：
    读了李士钊先生“我初步认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误”一文，我们感到李士钊先生并没有针对自己的错误来检讨。一开始，作者就列出了一大串“名人著作”，来说明作者之所以如此，是受了作品的影响。接着便又归咎于“不少的先进爱国的民主人士，也未加深刻分析地把‘武训’与民主政治运动连在一起，……形成文化教育界和人民群众中对他的错误认识”。此外，他又拉出“以‘武训’为名的学校”；“埋藏了不少革命学生和民主教师”来惑人视听。更不容忽视的是作者在他所作《武训画传》的自序中明明写着：“电影的编剧兼导演孙瑜先生的意见与我们的立场观点是完全一致的。”而现在，李士钊先生在他的文章中，检讨了电影《武训传》编导者孙瑜先生的错误，他对自己的《武训画传》却没有去认真批判。这种态度是不老实的。
    再看作者对武训这个人的认识吧。虽然作者说他“认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误”，但直到现在，李士钊先生对武训的认识仍是错误的。他虽然也举出光明日报社论中“武训是封建统治的拥护者，封建制度的崇拜者，封建道德的支持者”等语，但却又说“武训根本是一个没有政治活动的人”。我认为这样的辩解是不必要的。
                                              李卫民  马友群
            （二）编辑同志：
    看了五月三十一日人民日报所载李士钊先生“我初步认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误”一文，我认为这个检讨极不深刻，有些地方仍旧在为“武训精神”辩护。如李士钊先生把武训这一个彻头彻尾为反动统治阶级服务的奴才，说成“根本是一个没有政治活动的人”，当然，武训是不会与革命的太平天国运动有过什么关系。可是他在那时却和满清政府（太平天国的敌人，劳动人民的敌人）发生着密切的关系，这难道不是反动的政治活动吗？
    李士钊先生自己又说他对“武训精神”的宣扬“唯恐不能深入普及，一直不断地去搜集发掘所有关于他的一切文件，并加以修剪，为他写成一篇从生前到死后的‘传记’，有意地删除他的若干落后观点，如在他的说词中有讲到‘阴骘’的反科学思想等，都规避了去，把他尽量写成一个‘劳动人民的伟大典型’。”根据李先生这一自白，难道错误的原因仅仅是犯了“客观主义的错误”吗？
    我希望李士钊先生不要只在对武训个人或某些史实上打圈子，而应该联系自己的思想进行检讨。
