In Jinji County, Ningxia Province, anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work was carried out during the spring canal construction project, so that 1,786 laborers in the county were universally educated about resisting America and aiding Korea, and the efficiency of canal construction was greatly improved.

The vast majority of the laborers in Jinji County who participated in the canal construction had never suffered direct harm from American imperialism and Japanese bandits, and were not clear about the United States and Japan. But when it came to the local tyrant Ma Degui (the Nationalist Commander of Ma Hongkui's bandits), they gritted their teeth. Ma Degui forced many people to death and raped many women before liberation, and was a major tyrant in Jinji County. The propagandists of the Propaganda Committee of the Spring Repair Committee of the county led the laborers of each team to hold various meetings to denounce Ma Degui's crimes. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Ningxia, Ma Degui breached thirty-two places in the Han Canal, a major canal within Jinji, flooding more than 5,000 mu of crops and more than 500 houses, causing great losses to the people of the county. The laborers put forward accusations one after another. After hearing their accusations, the propagandists guided them to discuss why Ma Degui dared to be so rampant. The laborers said: Isn't it because Ma Hongkui and Chiang Kai-shek supported him!

But who supported Ma Hongkui and Chiang Kai-shek? The propagandists further used various facts to make the laborers realize that Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Hongkui's massacre of the people was supported by American imperialism. The laborers then realized that American imperialism was the total tyrant oppressing the Chinese people and the mortal enemy of the Chinese people.

After the laborers understood the American imperialist conspiracy of aggression and the principle of resisting America and aiding Korea, their labor enthusiasm was significantly improved. However, some individual laborers still held the attitude of serving in the past for Ma Hongkui's bandit gang to repair canals. The propagandists enlightened the old laborers and guided everyone to discuss the reason that in the past they were repairing canals for the Ma bandit and now they are repairing canals for themselves, for the sake of living a good life. The propagandists also linked the American imperialist aggression against Korea to the invasion of China, the restoration of the rule of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs, and the forcible occupation of our canals, so that the people could live that suffering life again. After the laborers understood the relationship between canal construction and resisting America and aiding Korea, they discussed what should be done? They proposed: The Volunteer Army went to Korea to fight the total tyrant for us, digging out the old roots of Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Hongkui's bandit gang. We must eliminate bandits and spies and suppress counter-revolutionaries in the rear. Some laborers also requested to join the militia organizations and farmers' associations. Everyone also decided to carry out a labor competition, putting forward the slogan "Carry one more load of pebbles is to kill one more American aggressor". After they launched the competition, the labor efficiency increased from an average of 0.8 cubic meters of pebbles per person per day to an average of more than 3 cubic meters per person per day. The original plan required 26,790 workdays for the project, but now it was completed with only 14,664 workdays.

When the laborers were working, the propagandists seized the time to use megaphones to make short "broadcasts" to report the victory news from the Korean front and the results of the competition of each team. They also set up blackboards on the construction site; used the rest time to teach the laborers to sing; organized literate people among the laborers to read newspapers to everyone; and organized people who could sing opera to participate in cultural and entertainment activities. Therefore, the laborers not only received education on resisting America and aiding Korea, but also their lives were enlivened.

　　宁夏省金积县        
    在修渠中进行时事宣传        
    民工工作效率大为提高
    宁夏省金积县在春季修渠工程中，进行了抗美援朝宣传工作，使该县一千七百八十六名民工普遍受到抗美援朝教育，修渠工作效率大为提高。
    金积县参加修渠的民工，绝大部分没有遭受过美帝国主义与日寇的直接残害，对美国和日本两个国家都不清楚。但一提到当地恶霸马德贵（马匪鸿逵的国民兵司令），他们都咬牙切齿。马德贵在解放前逼死过很多人命，奸淫了很多妇女，是金积县的大恶霸。该县春修委员会所属宣传委员会的宣传员们，便领导各队民工举行各种会议，控诉马德贵的罪行。马德贵在人民解放军进军宁夏时，曾将金积境内干渠——汉渠决口三十二处，淹没庄稼五千余亩，房屋五百余间，造成全县人民很大的损失。民工们纷纷提出控诉。宣传员们在他们控诉之后，引导他们讨论马德贵为什么胆敢如此横行霸道？民工们说：还不是马鸿逵、蒋介石给他撑腰！
    但是谁给马鸿逵、蒋介石撑腰呢？宣传员又进一步引用种种事实，使民工们认识蒋介石、马鸿逵屠杀人民，是靠美帝国主义支持的。民工们这才明白了美帝国主义原来是压迫中国人民的总恶霸，是中国人民的死敌。
    民工们懂得了美帝国主义侵略阴谋和抗美援朝的道理以后，劳动情绪显著提高。但仍有个别民工抱着过去给马鸿逵匪帮修渠的应差的态度。宣传员们就启发老民工，引导大家讨论过去是给马匪修渠和现在是给自己修渠，是为了自己过好日子的道理。宣传员并联系到美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，就是为了侵略中国，为了恢复蒋、马匪帮的统治，为了强占咱们的水渠，使人民再过那苦难的生活。民工们懂得了修渠和抗美援朝的关系以后，就讨论应该怎样办？他们提出：志愿军到朝鲜给咱们打总恶霸，挖蒋介石，马鸿逵匪帮的老根子去了，咱们在后方要肃清土匪特务、镇压反革命。有些民工并要求参加民兵组织和农会。大家并决定开展劳动竞赛，提出“多背一背斗石子，就是多打死一个美国侵略军”的口号，他们展开竞赛以后，劳动效率由每天每人平均挖石子零点八公方提高到每天每人平均挖三公方以上。原计划需要二万六千七百九十个工的工程，现在只用了一万四千六百六十四个工便完成了。
    宣传员在民工做工时抓紧时间用广播筒作简短的“广播”，报告朝鲜前线的胜利消息和各队竞赛的成绩。他们在工地上还办了黑板报；利用休息时间教民工们唱歌；把民工中识字的人组织起来，给大家读报；并组织会唱戏的人参加文化娱乐活动。因此，民工们不仅受到了抗美援朝的教育，并且他们的生活也因而活跃起来。
