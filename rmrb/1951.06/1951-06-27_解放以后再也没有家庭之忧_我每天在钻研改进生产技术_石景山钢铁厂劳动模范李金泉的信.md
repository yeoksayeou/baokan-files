　　After Liberation, There Are No More Family Worries; I Spend Every Day Studying and Improving Production Technology
    ——A Letter from Li Jinquan, Labor Model of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

Dearest Chairman Mao:

    The 30th anniversary of our Party is approaching. Under your wise leadership, our Party has become glorious and strong, which is worthy of our celebration. In the old society, I could not get enough to eat or wear every day, living like a beast of burden. Once I got sick, I had to stop working and my family went hungry. That kind of painful life has disappeared since liberation. The Communist Party and you have liberated us workers, which is why we have such a good life today. In today's new society, especially myself, I have been cultivated and educated by the Party and selected as a national labor model representative, which I never dreamed of in the past. Today, I truly know that the Communist Party is the party of the working class, and I realize that the Communist Party and the working class are connected by blood. Now, although we are still in the period of economic recovery and construction, my life has improved countless times compared to the past. Now I live in a newly built dormitory that is very spacious. I often buy some cloth for my children and adults to change clothes every season, and rarely eat coarse grains every month. Since the Labor Insurance Regulations were implemented, seeing a doctor and being hospitalized does not cost money. This relieves me of worries about family life, and I can concentrate on production. In the old society, I used to drift aimlessly all day long; now I always feel that production is too slow. Now I spend every day studying and improving my technology, and striving to improve my cultural and political understanding, so that our country can move towards a socialist society step by step. I also want to unite the workers in our factory and further improve production. Recently, after the workers in our factory heard the report from the representatives of the delegation to North Korea to express condolences, they unanimously responded to the call of the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The entire factory is working hard to overfulfill the annual production target and create more wealth for the country. We have revised our patriotic pact and integrated the pact with specific work. We must implement the economic accounting system to increase output and reduce costs. Our forging and welding workshop has also established a production increase team with the enthusiasm of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. To commemorate the Party's birthday, I am studying how to further reduce the cost of welding rods and further improve the quality. In my patriotic pact, I also set a goal: to go deep into various sites, mobilize the masses to put forward more rationalization proposals, and ensure that I patiently teach apprentices, teach them well, and learn well, as a gift to July 1st.

      I wish you good health!
              Li Jinquan, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

　　解放以后再也没有家庭之忧  我每天在钻研改进生产技术
    ——石景山钢铁厂劳动模范李金泉的信敬爱的毛主席：
    我们党的三十周年纪念日快到了。在您的英明领导之下，使我们的党光辉而壮大起来了，这是值得我们庆祝的。我在旧社会里，每天吃不饱、穿不暖，过牛马一样的生活。一生了病，人歇工，牙挂对。那样子的痛苦生活，从解放后再也看不见了。共产党和您把我们工人解放出来了，才有今天这样好的光景。在今天的新社会里面，尤其是我自己，受了党的培养与教育，被选为全国劳动模范代表，这是我过去作梦也想不到的事情。今天我确实知道了共产党是工人阶级的党，我体会到共产党与工人阶级是血肉相连的。现在，虽然还在恢复经济建设时期，但是我的生活比起以前来已改善了不知多少倍。现在我住的新盖的宿舍非常宽大，每季经常买些布给孩子大人换换衣服，每月很少吃粗粮食；自从有了劳动保险条例，看病住院不花钱。这使我没有了家庭生活之忧，一心一意搞生产。过去在旧社会成天瞎混，现在总嫌生产搞得慢。现在我每天在钻研和改进我的技术，努力提高文化政治，使我们的国家一步步地走向社会主义社会。我还要团结我厂工人，把生产再提高一步。最近我厂工人听了赴朝慰问团代表的报告，一致响应了抗美援朝总会的号召。全厂都正在为超额完成全年生产任务，为国家创造更多的财富而努力。我们修正了自己的爱国公约，把公约结合了具体的工作。要实行经济核算制，使产量增高，把成本降低。我们锻焊场更以抗美援朝的热情成立了增产组。为了纪念党的生日，我正研究把焊条成本再降低一步，质量再提高一步。在我的爱国公约中，也定了一条：深入各现场，发动群众多提合理化建议，保证耐心教徒弟，教好、学好，作为给“七一”的献礼。
      祝您身体健康！
              石景山钢铁厂  李金泉
