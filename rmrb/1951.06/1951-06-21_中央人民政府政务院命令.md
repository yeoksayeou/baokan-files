　　Order of the State Council of the Central People's Government
    The "Summary of Forestry Work in 1950 and Plan for Forestry Work in 1951" and the "Summary of the National Forestry Conference in 1951" of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government have been approved by the 80th meeting of this Council. In these two documents, many tasks must be arranged and implemented by the people's governments at all levels. In particular, the work related to protecting mountains and forests, preventing mountain fires, and preventing indiscriminate logging must be listed as one of the important tasks of our people's government, in order to implement the central government's forestry policy and better coordinate and develop agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy production and construction. It is hoped that responsible cadres of people's governments at all levels will carefully study these two documents, give appropriate and sufficient attention to forestry work in the future, strengthen leadership, regularly conduct forestry education for cadres, and inspect the implementation of the work.
    This order.
            Premier Zhou Enlai
              May 31, 1951
