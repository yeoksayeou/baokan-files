Our Great Motherland
In ancient China, during the Three Kingdoms period, the inventor Ma Jun created a south-pointing chariot. Utilizing the differential action of gears, the wooden figure on the chariot always pointed south. It was composed of five gears, two wheels, and two pulleys. This is a model of the south-pointing chariot replicated based on the method transmitted by Yan Su of the Song Dynasty.
