A Typical Example of the Unprecedentedly Enhanced Political Awareness of the Masses in Newly Liberated Areas
The Case of the Heinous Landlord in Fuling, Sichuan, Falsely Accusing Cadres Has Been Judged

At the First National Supervisory Work Conference, the People's Supervisory Committee of the Southwest Military and Political Committee made a typical report regarding the case of Li Binglie, a heinous landlord and "Gelaohui" (secret society) leader in Luoyun Township, Fuling County, Sichuan, who falsely accused cadre Liu Juwen. The case was investigated and handled by the committee in December of last year.

Before liberation, Li Binglie murdered four people including communist party member Li Huantang, embezzled dozens of dan (unit of dry measure) of grain intended for preferential treatment of soldiers' families, and raped women, committing all kinds of evil deeds. After liberation, he controlled the farmers' association, resisted the payment of public grain, and undermined government decrees. He further gathered together special agents Luo Zejun, He Longjiang, and Li Maofu from the township, colluding with feudal organizations such as "Lianhan Society," "Datong Society," "Hanming Society," "Fuquan Society," and "Yixin Society," as well as landlord Li Zhurong and others, spreading rumors and doing everything possible to frame the township instructor Liu Juwen. Li Binglie first falsely accused Liu Juwen of being a "special agent and local tyrant," but failed. Later, he instigated special agent Luo Zejun to assassinate Liu Juwen, but this also failed. Finally, he took advantage of the relationship between his second son, Li Shusheng, and Li Tian'en, a deputy platoon leader of a certain People's Liberation Army unit stationed there, who had both served in the Kuomintang Youth Army, to falsely accuse Liu Juwen to Liu Wanjun, the deputy company commander of a certain PLA company. Liu Wanjun then arbitrarily sent Li Tian'en to the township to convene a mass meeting to struggle against Liu Juwen. When Liu Wanjun came to attend the meeting, Li Binglie and others wined and dined Liu Wanjun, provided an 18-year-old girl, Zhao Bilian, as company, and bribed Liu Wanjun with fifty pairs of socks. After that, Li Binglie further used insidious schemes, directing Li Zhurong and dozens of others to go to the regimental headquarters of the local garrison to "cry injustice." Li, the deputy director of the political department of the regiment, did not investigate the "injustice" petitioners and arbitrarily ordered Liu Juwen to be sent to the Fuling County Commissioner's Office for processing. After learning about this, Li Binglie further instructed Li Shuyao to bribe Liu Wanjun with sixty silver dollars, instructing him to kill Liu Juwen on the way, but fortunately, this was discovered by cadres of the regiment, and a tragic incident was avoided. Seeing that multiple conspiracies had failed, Li Binglie further stole the name of "peaceful signature" and borrowed the name of "struggle against local tyrants" to collect 1,879 names (even children's and deceased people's names were written on it) and wrote a "People's Petition Against Tyranny," fabricating forty-three "crimes" of Liu Juwen and submitting it to more than twenty places including the district people's government and even the central people's government. The "petition" also fabricated that Liu Juwen's "reactionary facts" had been "verified as true" after four "township-wide people's democratic struggle meetings" convened by a certain company of the People's Liberation Army.

Although this case was investigated by organs such as the Fuling Special District Court and Public Security Bureau, because they failed to go deep among the masses to understand the situation, they all believed that the joint accusation of thousands of people, including Li Binglie, was "reasonable and well-founded," and they planned to sentence Liu Juwen to five years in prison.

The Southwest People's Supervisory Committee realized that the case was of great importance. Therefore, they sent people to investigate. The investigators, in coordination with the local government, combined inspection work and learned about the historical situation of the people involved in the case through individual interviews and small forums. After analyzing it, they went deep among the masses to investigate. At first, the masses were very apprehensive, fearing retaliation from the local tyrants, and dared not tell the truth. It took more than a month to understand the situation clearly. Then, they helped local staff rectify the farmers' associations, cleanse impure elements, and convene mass meetings, where many people publicly exposed the tricks of the heinous landlords. At the meeting, the dissolution of all reactionary organizations such as the "Lianhan Society" was announced.

After reinvestigation and public trial by the Fuling Special District Court, Li Binglie and special agents Luo Zejun and He Longjiang were executed in December of last year. Liu Wanjun, the deputy company commander of a certain company, was given a dismissal punishment by the Fuling Military Sub-district. Liu Juwen, the township instructor, remained steadfast, worked actively and responsibly, and continued to serve in his position.

After the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionaries were struck down, the political awareness of the masses was unprecedentedly enhanced, the backward elements who had been deceived for a time were won over, the entire feudal clique in Luoyun Township was crushed, and the peasants stood up straight. Farmer He Jiashu said: "This time, the historical accounts of Luoyun Township have finally been settled, the root of the trouble has been dug up, and we will no longer be afraid of landlords causing trouble." Liu Maolun, who had been used by the local tyrants and is now aware of it, said: "I will never fall into the trap of the heinous landlords again."

　　新区群众政治觉悟空前提高的一个典型例子
    四川涪陵恶霸地主诬告干部案已判决
    在第一次全国监察工作会议上，西南军政委员会人民监察委员会作了一个典型报告，报告该会于去年十二月间，调查处理的四川涪陵县罗云乡恶霸地主，“哥老会”头子李炳烈等诬告干部刘巨文一案。
    李炳烈在解放前曾杀害共产党员李焕堂等四人，贪污壮丁优待谷数十石，强奸妇女，无恶不作。解放之后，把持农会，抗缴公粮，破坏政府法令。更纠集该乡特务罗泽君、何龙江、李懋馥，勾结“联汉社”、“大同社”、“汉明社”、“福全社”、“一心社”等封建团体及地主李祝荣等，散布谣言，千方百计陷害该乡指导员刘巨文。李炳烈先诬告刘巨文为“特务恶霸”，没有成功。后又唆使特务罗泽君前往暗杀刘巨文也遭失败。最后利用其次子李树生与驻该地解放军某部副排长李天恩曾同在蒋匪青年军共事的关系，向解放军某连副连长刘万钧诬告刘巨文。刘万钧竟擅自派李天恩到该乡召开群众大会斗争刘巨文。刘万钧赶来参加大会时，李炳烈等又请刘万钧吃饭，以十八岁的姑娘赵碧莲作陪，又用袜子五十双贿赂刘万钧。此后，李炳烈更进一步使用奸计，指使李祝荣等数十人去当地驻军某团部“喊冤”。该团政治处李副主任不对“喊冤”人进行调查，竟擅令将刘巨文押送涪陵县专署处理。李炳烈得知后，又指使李淑尧用银元六十元贿赂刘万钧，嘱在途中将刘巨文杀死，幸被该团干部发觉，未造成惨案。李炳烈见多次阴谋未成，便进一步盗用“和平签名”及借“斗争恶霸”名义，凑集起一千八百七十九个名字（连小孩及死者的名字都写上去），写了“人民反霸请愿书”，捏造刘巨文四十三条“罪状”，向区人民政府直至中央人民政府二十余处投告。“请愿书”中并捏称刘巨文的“反动事实”，业经人民解放军某连召开“全乡人民民主斗争大会”四次，“查明确实”。
    此案虽经涪陵专区法院、公安局等机关调查，但因未能深入群众进行了解，故都认为李炳烈等千余人的联名控告，“有理有据”，拟判处刘巨文五年徒刑。
    西南人民监察委员会察觉此案案情重大。遂派人前往调查。调查人员配合当地政府，结合检查工作，通过个别访问，小型座谈会，先了解本案有关人的历史情况，作了分析之后，又深入群众进行调查。最初，群众思想顾虑很大，怕恶霸报复，不敢实说。经过一个多月才把情况了解清楚。接着帮助当地工作人员整顿农会，清洗不纯分子，召集群众大会，很多人都当众揭穿了恶霸地主的阴谋花样。会上，宣布解散了“联汉社”等一切反动组织。
    此案经涪陵专区法院复查公审判决，已于去年十二月将李炳烈及特务罗泽君、何龙江执行枪决。某连副连长刘万钧由涪陵军分区给以撤职处分。该乡指导员刘巨文，立场坚定，工作积极负责，仍继续担任工作。
    反革命首恶分子被打击后，群众的政治觉悟空前提高，争取了一时被欺骗的落后分子，摧垮了罗云乡的整个封建集团，农民挺起了腰板。农民何家树说：“这下子可算清了罗云乡的历史账，挖了祸根，以后再也不怕地主捣乱了。”被恶霸利用现已觉悟了的刘懋伦说：“今后再不会上恶霸地主的圈套了。”
