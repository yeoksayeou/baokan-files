　　Economic Accounting System is the Basic Method for Operating and Managing People's Railways
    --Report at the Ministry Meeting on June 5, 1951, after Returning to Beijing from Inspecting the Northeast Railway
    Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government, Teng Daiyuan

At the Bureau Director Conference held by the Ministry of Railways in February this year, the issue of implementing economic accounting was raised. Why emphasize this issue? Because in actual work, everyone has felt that although great achievements were made last year, there were also many serious shortcomings. The only way to overcome these shortcomings is to implement the economic accounting system. After the national railway station, section, and factory investigation and research meeting in April, we have learned that most units in the national railway system have gone through the first stage—the work of democratic reform (those regions and units where democratic reform work has not been carried out sufficiently must seriously make up for this lesson in order to have a foundation). And we have found the path of implementing economic accounting level by level from top to bottom. Judging from the situation of the Northeast Railway and the China Changchun Railway (CCR), the Northeast Railway has made great achievements in its work in recent years, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. However, some leading comrades have developed a complacent and relaxed mood and lack railway operation and management methods suitable for the new situation. Since last year, especially since last winter and this spring, the operational management work of the Northeast Railway has more clearly exposed the passive state of its work, resulting in the failure to complete tasks. On the other hand, the Sino-Soviet joint venture CCR implemented the economic accounting system from the very beginning based on the existing foundation of the Northeast Railway. In the past year, it has achieved significant development in all aspects. From this, it can be concluded that the implementation of the economic accounting system in the construction of China's People's Railways is not only necessary but also possible. All railway administrations nationwide have decided to implement the economic accounting system starting on July 1. The economic accounting system is the basic method for operating and managing people's railway enterprises under the centralized guidance of the national economy. Its purpose is to promote everyone's enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, increase labor productivity, increase output, improve quality, eliminate waste, reduce costs, accelerate capital turnover, and increase profits, thereby achieving expanded reproduction and improving the material and cultural living standards of employees.

What issues should be paid attention to during implementation? Based on existing experience, the following issues should be noted.

    I. Improve Production Efficiency, Strive for Profits, and Accumulate Funds for the Country

The first basic link in implementing the economic accounting system in railway enterprises is to improve transportation production efficiency, unleash the potential capacity of railways, complete national tasks, and strive for profits to accumulate funds for the country. Chairman Mao said as early as in "On Coalition Government": "In order to develop industry, a large amount of capital is needed. Where does it come from? There are only two sources: mainly relying on the Chinese people's own accumulation of capital, and at the same time, borrowing from foreign aid." We should strive to pay more profits to the country to accumulate industrial construction funds and accelerate the progress of industrial construction. Railway construction funds should also be accumulated in this way. Specifically, our railway operation should first complete and exceed the production and financial plan's production indicators and financial indicators. That is, it must complete the number of loaded cars, turnover time, passenger-kilometers (note), ton-kilometers (note), and financial income. The CCR grasped this link tightly. In the past eight months, profits exceeded the plan by 445 percent. The CCR's profit per converted ton-kilometer (note) was 24 yuan RMB according to plan, while the Northeast Railway's profit per converted ton-kilometer was 7 yuan according to plan, even though their freight rates were the same. The leading cadres and all employees of the CCR have a very clear concept of striving for profits. In the first quarter of this year, their available vehicles were as insufficient as those of other railway administrations, but they still overfulfilled their tasks. They regard the plans approved by the state as law. The director of the railway administration personally calculates carefully and knows the vehicle situation of his bureau every day, and strictly supervises the implementation of technical operations. Factories and car repair sections fight to shorten the time vehicles spend in the factory and reduce the rate of defective cars. However, many of our comrades are only complaining about the lack of available vehicles and lack more proactive ways to solve the problem. The director of the railway administration, the director of the sub-bureau, and even the stationmaster do not seize the loading and unloading of cars every day and strictly supervise the implementation of technical operations. A review of the actual turnover rate in the first quarter of this year shows that, except for the Hengyang and Taiyuan railway administrations, which are slightly better, most of them have not completed their plans. The national railway only completed 98 percent of the state's transportation tasks in the first quarter, and the Northeast Railway (excluding the CCR) only completed 90.2 percent. It should be understood that without the conditions of producing more, completing the loading of major goods, and striving for more revenue, there is no economic accounting to speak of.

Judging from the situation in the past five months, this year is no longer a situation of having no goods to transport. This year, the Northeast Railway only meets 80 to 90 percent of the state plan's needs; the situation in the off-season in the railways within the passes has also changed greatly this year. When the off-season began in April last year, railways across the country began to seal up many freight cars; this year, just after May, there is a feeling of insufficient vehicles. This shows that our country's economy is gradually developing and gradually carrying out planned management, gradually changing the law of the "off-season." Our railway management personnel must come up with more ways under the existing equipment conditions. For example, shortening dwell time, increasing travel speed, organizing direct trains, strengthening night loading and unloading work, attaching importance to unloading, strictly sorting empties, using flatcars to load grain, and adding side loading of coal (it is not appropriate to load coal in boxcars); and overcoming the counterflow transportation of goods, long-distance transportation, short-distance transportation, and unreasonable transportation can all save vehicles and load more cars. After the Northeast changed the coal transportation zoning in the second quarter, the counterflow was reduced, and the average transportation distance was shortened by 90 kilometers, saving 50,000 carloads per year.

    II. Strive to Save, Reduce Costs

The second link is saving. Without strict savings and cost reduction, all the money earned is wasted, so what is the point of talking about economic accounting? What is the point of talking about accumulating funds for the country? The first step in carrying out this work is to seriously carry out a thorough inventory and valuation of materials, faithfully implement the decision of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on clearing assets and determining funds, strictly regulate working capital, and resolutely eliminate the waste of stockpiled materials. Last year, the CCR changed its working capital from the original 40 percent of the Northeast to 25 percent, and this year it has been reduced to 22.8 percent. Reducing waste, utilizing waste materials, and rationally saving materials should become a matter of concern for every employee. Awards should be given to those who have achieved results in saving. Strictly review all expenditures in accordance with plans and indicators, formulate scientific expenditure item lists, strictly supervise, and tighten the expenditure of administrative management fees and workshop indirect production fees.

Strictly and rationally reviewing staffing levels, determining job titles, liberating and saving labor, and determining working hours to save labor time are all necessary for the current interests of the country and workers. There are still serious irrationalities and waste in the allocation and organization of labor. Some units are short of people; some units have too many people, and there is actually no 480 minutes of work. Units that implement the economic accounting system generally feel that it is difficult to deal with having too many people and should conduct reasonable adjustments in a planned manner.

On the CCR, the first thing the person in charge of each unit reports when reporting on their work is the status of completing the plan, and the second is the effect of saving. Of their profits in the past eight months, three-quarters were due to overfulfilling the task, and one-quarter came from saving expenses. The work of reducing costs should be carefully calculated from all aspects and work, such as reducing empty car rate, reducing single locomotive running, saving fuel oil, increasing traction tonnage, increasing the technical loading capacity of vehicles, verifying various standards, and so on.

    III. Rely on the Enthusiasm of the Broad Masses

Implementing economic accounting is linked to improving the political and ideological awareness of employees, improving the material and cultural life of employees, improving employee skills, and improving working conditions.

When production efficiency increases to a certain standard, wages also increase to a certain proportion. In the mechanical branch of the Harbin Railway Factory, production and financial plans have penetrated into the workshop teams. Piecework wages have been implemented, and the Kovalov work method is being promoted. Production efficiency has increased by 270 percent, and actual wages have increased by 200 percent compared to basic wages. The rise in this proportional number is reasonable and appropriate.

Good attention must be paid to safety and employee health. The CCR used waste materials to install safety covers on most machines, and various safety equipment has increased from 30 percent in the past to 90 percent. They strongly emphasize safety and pay attention to accidents. At the anniversary of the CCR, Chairman Yelogov announced six tasks for future work. The first is: ensure train safety and eliminate accidents. In the red flag competition, it is stipulated that as long as an accident occurs, the qualification for winning the red flag of excellence will be cancelled. The factory has a safety engineer, and the trade union has a labor insurance inspector, who regularly conduct health and safety inspections, raise various issues, and solve them. On the Northeast Railway, the work of protecting the health of employees is generally given more attention, such as providing health meals to employees who perform health-damaging work, starting to establish sanatoriums and spare-time sanatoriums, and improving the work of hospitals and clinics. Within the country, crew dormitories have developed somewhat in the past year. With the increase in labor productivity, the living and working conditions of employees should be continuously improved and enhanced in all aspects.

In order to continuously improve labor efficiency and carry out construction from a long-term perspective, the improvement of employees' technical level and the related improvement of their political and cultural level must be given great importance. Many units of the CCR have education engineers who treat the organization of employees to improve their technical and cultural levels as a dedicated task. The technical education room is equipped with many instruments, models, and charts. Outstanding workers are regularly selected to enter technical schools, and special attention is paid to the training of outstanding young workers, and a large number of worker cadres are trained and promoted. Rationalization proposals should be carried out with leadership and planning. Importance should be attached to organizing technical publicity work, such as holding advanced producer conferences and exhibitions. The heavy production process should be gradually mechanized, and tools should be improved to increase production efficiency and reduce labor intensity.

There must be a sound reward system. The continuous strengthening of employees' cultural life is also an important task.

With the economic accounting system, a certain reward fund can be obtained from profits and extra-profit plans. Each enterprise unit can use it to reward outstanding workers and improve the material, cultural life, and working conditions of employees. Our state-owned enterprises, the State Council has stipulated that up to 30 percent of the extra-profit plan should be used as the factory reward fund. We should mobilize all employees to strive for more extra-plan profits from increasing income and reducing expenses so that we can obtain more of this factory reward fund.

Production and financial plans should be handed over to the masses for extensive discussion. Each unit's monthly financial summary should be reported to all employees. In this way, it becomes the masses' own thing, which can guarantee completion.

    IV. Implement a Strict System and Establish a Clear Division of Labor and Responsibility System

The economic accounting system is determined by accurate plans and is also determined by the guarantee of appropriate organizational systems, such as independent accounting systems, statistical systems for original documents, and necessary supervision, auditing, and wage and working hour organizations. All work relies on strict supervision, which is guaranteed by the combination of the enthusiasm of the masses and scientific systems. The regulations for implementing the economic accounting system specifically stipulate: who has what authority, for example, the head of the unit can use all of his funds according to the quantity and quality required by the plan, has an independent account in the bank, and can sign contracts with other units (this contract does not hinder the completion of his own tasks, and is not unorganized), who has what responsibility, those who must also bear material responsibility, and those who violate the rules will be fined from their bonuses. Who should ask whom for instructions, and who should make the decisions. This not only frees up the time of leading cadres, allowing them to actively delve into their work, but also gives play to the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the lower levels. Problems are solved in a timely manner, and there is no longer a need for a public document to travel for 170 days to install a telephone. In the past, a person's reward was often delayed for a long time in public documents, and by the time the reward was issued, it had already been reduced or lost its effect. At the same time, organization and discipline will also be strengthened because those who should not handle or make decisions will not arbitrarily handle or make decisions and make mistakes again.

    V. Strengthen Cadre Learning and Propaganda to All Employees

Another important task in promoting the economic accounting system is to have cadres learn, carry out propaganda to the broad masses of employees, and organize them to take action. Veteran cadres should not be satisfied with a superficial understanding of their business, but should move from proficiency to mastery; and they should always pay attention to continuously improving their Marxist-Leninist level. New cadres should continue to strictly criticize the old technical viewpoints and learn advanced technical business in combination with the masses; more importantly, they should strive to learn politics and Marxism-Leninism. With Marxism-Leninism, they will have weapons and a correct direction to unleash their strength. Objectively, we are required to gradually become cadres who are both politically astute and technically proficient, like Soviet experts. We can foresee the development of our work and what problems should be solved and how to solve them. Chairman Mao once asked veteran cadres to learn economics within three to five years. The results of the learning should be checked. Whether they have learned or not, whether they have learned well or not, the results of the work are the best test questions and fair and impartial judges. Learning scientific things requires hard work. Marx said in "Capital" that there is no smooth road to science, only those who are not afraid of hard work and are not afraid of danger can hope to reach the pinnacle of glory.

We must learn from the Soviet Union, and more specifically, we must learn from the CCR. It is a typical example of combining advanced Soviet experience with China's specific conditions, and it is a practical school. Send energetic cadres who are sensitive to new things and have a certain ability to accept and model workers to learn. Go deep into one subject in a comprehensive connection and understanding, and thoroughly learn one thing. Some things that are already commonplace in the CCR, such as how to hold a meeting, need to be learned. The various publications and newspapers of the Ministry of Railways should make publicizing the CCR a central task. In learning advanced Soviet experience, it is necessary to strictly distinguish and investigate, and it is not allowed to mix in and impersonate things from the United States, Britain, or Japan, otherwise it will harm people and ourselves. We also need to run some training courses to train specialized personnel to strengthen economic accounting work, such as accounting, planning, statistics, working hours, and wages personnel.

Through various forms, explain to all employees what economic accounting is, what it is for, what problems it will solve, how it will solve them, what are the benefits to the country, and what are the benefits to employees. The Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League must all publicize, and the responsible cadres must personally speak. While making general calls, individual key guidance is implemented (dispatching a small number of capable cadres to specifically help solve certain key problems, mainly relying on giving play to the enthusiasm of the employees of the unit and mastering advanced work methods to solve the problems). This is Chairman Mao's leadership method. On the basis of the broad masses of employees understanding and taking action, and on the basis of being effective in individual places, the administration proposes production targets and specific guarantee measures. Under the leadership of the trade union, carry out mass competition movements to complete production and financial plans and save resources.

Implementing the economic accounting system is also a process of going from shallow to deep, from no experience to having experience, and from rough to more strict and meticulous. The economic accounting system is completely the opposite of the supply system. It determines expenditures based on how the task is completed, and everything must be carried out according to plan. It is necessary to eliminate some of the existing supply system thinking, the thinking of simply completing tasks, and the irresponsible thinking among our cadres. Make the economic accounting system successfully implemented and increasingly consolidated in the railway system in the next two years.

　　经济核算制是经营管理人民铁路的基本方法
    ——一九五一年六月五日由东北铁路视察回京在部务会议上的报告
    中央人民政府铁道部部长  滕代远
    铁道部在今年二月举行的管理局长会议上，提出了实行经济核算的问题。为什么要强调提出这个问题呢？因为大家在实际工作中已感到去年工作虽有很大的成绩，但同时也存在着许多严重的缺点，克服这些缺点的办法，只有实行经济核算制。经过四月份全国铁路站、段、厂调查研究会议之后，我们已了解到全国铁路系统各单位大部已经过了第一阶段——民主改革的工作，（某些地区和单位民主改革工作进行得不充分的，必须认真补好这一课，才能有基础。）并摸到了自上而下逐级实行经济核算的道路。从东北铁路和中长路的情况看来，东北铁路几年来工作有很大成绩，群众热情是很高的。但在某些领导同志中，则产生了自满松懈的情绪，缺乏适合新情况的铁路经营管理办法。但东北铁路的经营管理工作自去年开始，特别是去冬今春以来，更加明显地暴露了工作上被动的状况，因而发生了完不成任务的现象；而中苏合办的中长路一开始就在东北铁路现有基础上实行了经济核算制，一年来，在各方面，都有显著的发展。由此，可以得出结论：在中国人民铁路建设中，实行经济核算制，已不但是必需而且是可能了。全国各铁路管理局一级，已决定在七月一日开始实行经济核算制，经济核算制，是在国家经济集中指导下经营管理人民铁道企业的基本方法，其目的在于发扬大家的积极性和责任心，提高劳动生产率增加产量，提高质量，消灭浪费，减低成本，加速资金周转，增加利润从而达到扩大再生产，并提高职工物质与文化生活水平。
    在执行当中，应当注意那些问题呢？就已有的体验来说，应当注意以下的问题。
    一、提高生产效率，争取利润，为国家积累资金
    在铁路企业中实行经济核算制，第一个基本环节是提高运输生产效率，发挥铁路的潜在能力，完成国家任务，争取利润为国家积累资金。毛主席早在论联合政府中就说过：“为着发展工业，需要大批资本。从什么地方来呢？不外两方面：主要地依靠中国人民自己积累资本，同时借助于外援。”我们应当争取向国家多缴利润，为国家积累工业建设资金，以加速工业建设的进度。铁路建设资金也应当用这个办法来积累。具体地说：我们的铁道经营首先应完成与超过生产及财务计划的生产指标和财务指标。即须完成装车数、周转时间、人公里（注）、吨公里（注）及财务收入。中长路抓紧了这一环，在去年八个月中，利润超计划完成百分之四四五，中长路每换算吨公里（注）合计划利润二十四元人民币，东北其他铁路每换算吨公里计划利润为七元，他们的运价是一样的。中长路领导干部以至全体职工，对争取利润的观念是非常明确的。今年第一季度他们的运用车同其他各路局一样不足，却仍然超计划完成了任务。他们把国家批准的计划看成法律，管理局长始终是亲自每天仔细地计算和熟知本局车辆情况，并严格地监督车辆的运用。工厂和检车段为缩短车辆在厂时间，减少残车率而斗争。而我们有许多同志只是在叫运用车不够，缺乏更多的主动的想办法，管理局长、分局长、乃至站长，不能每天抓紧装卸车，和严格监督技术作业实施情况。检查一下今年第一季度的周转率实绩，可以看出除衡阳、太原两个路局稍好外，一般的都未完成计划。国家给铁路的运输任务，第一季度全国只完成百分之九十八，东北（不包括中长路）铁路只完成百分之九○·二。应当了解：没有多生产，完成主要货物的装车，争取多收入这些条件，便没有经济核算可言。
    根据五个月来的情况看，今年已不是无货可运了。东北铁路今年只满足国家计划需要的百分之八○到九○；关内铁路今年淡季情况也大为改变。去年四月份淡月开始时全国铁路就开始封存了很多的货车车皮；今年五月刚过，即感车辆不足。这说明我们国家的经济已在逐渐发展，并逐步进行着有计划的管理，逐渐改变了“淡月”的规律。我们铁道管理人员要在现有设备条件下想出更多的办法来。例如缩短停留时间，提高旅行速度，组织直达列车，加强夜间装卸工作，重视卸车，严格排空，利用平板车装粮，加边装煤（棚车装煤不妥当）；又如克服货物的对流运输、过远距离运输、短途运输及不合理的运输等，都可以节省车辆，多装车。东北第二季度开始改变煤运分区后，减少了对流，运输距离平均缩短九○公里，每年可节省出五万辆车皮。
    二、力求节约，降低成本
    第二个环节便是节约。如果没有严格节约和降低成本，把收入的钱都浪费掉了，还讲什么经济核算呢？还讲什么为国家积累资金呢？在这个工作的进行上，第一步便要认真进行材料的彻底清查和估价的工作，忠实地执行中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会关于清理资财核定资金的决定，严格地规定流动资金，坚决消灭积压材料的浪费现象。中长路去年由东北原占百分之四十的流动资金，改定为百分之二十五，今年已压缩为百分之二十二·八。要把减少废品，利用废料，合理节约材料，使之成为每一个职工所关心的事情。对节约有成绩者，应给以奖励。按照计划和指标严格审查一切支出，制定科学的开支项目表，严格监督，紧缩行政管理费及车间间接生产费的开支。
    严格与合理地审查定员，确定职名，解放和节省劳动力，查定工时以节约劳动时间，对国家和工人当前利益都是需要的。劳动力的分配与组织目前还存在着严重的不合理和浪费现象。有些单位缺人；有些单位人多，实际没有四百八十分钟的工作，实行经济核算制的单位，一般感觉人多不好处理，应该有计划地进行合理调整。
    在中长路上，每个单位的负责同志在报告工作时，第一件是完成计划的情况，第二便讲节约的效果。他们去年八个月利润，四分之三是由于超额完成任务，四分之一是节约开支得来的。降低成本的工作要从减少空车率，减少单机走行，节省燃料油脂，增加牵引吨数，增加车辆的技术装载量，检定各种标准等等各方面，各种工作中去仔细计算。
    三、依靠广大群众的积极性
    实行经济核算是与提高职工的政治思想觉悟，提高职工的物质、文化生活，提高职工技术，改善劳动条件等联在一起的。
    生产效率在一定标准上再提高的时候，工资也在一定比例上提高。哈尔滨铁路工厂的机械分厂里，生产及财务计划已深入到车间小组，实行了计件工资，推行着郭瓦廖夫的工作方法，生产效率提高百分之二七○，实际工资较基本工资提高百分之二○○。这个比例数字的上涨，是合理和恰当的。
    要很好的注意安全和职工健康，中长路利用废料在大部机器上装设了安全罩，各种安全设备已由以往的百分之三○增加到百分之九○。他们十分强调安全和注意事故，中长理事会主席叶洛果夫同志在中长路一周年纪念会上对今后工作宣布了六项任务，第一便是：保证列车安全，消灭事故。在红旗竞赛中规定，只要发生一次事故，就取消获得优胜红旗的资格。工厂内设有安全工程师，工会有劳动保险监察员，经常进行卫生安全检查，提出各种问题—并加以解决。在东北铁路上保护职工健康的工作一般的比较注意，如给担任损害健康工作的职工吃保健饭，开始举办了休养所及业余休养所，改善着医院和门诊所的工作。在全国范围内，乘务员公寓在去年一年内有若干发展。随着劳动生产率的上涨，要从各方面把职工的生活和工作条件不断的加以改善与提高。
    为不断地提高劳动效率，从长期着眼进行建设，职工技术水平的提高及与此相联的政治文化水平的提高，必须引起极大的重视。中长路不少的单位设有教育工程师，把组织职工提高技术和文化，作为一个专门工作去做，在技术教育室里设有许多仪器、模型和图表。经常轮流选拔优秀工人进技术学校，特别注意优秀青年工人的训练，大量地培养与提拔工人干部。合理化建议要有领导有计划地进行。要重视组织技术宣传工作，如召开先进生产者会议，举行展览会等。要把笨重的生产过程逐渐机械化，改善工具，使生产效率提高和减轻劳动强度。
    要有健全的奖励制度。职工文化生活的不断加强，也是一件重要工作。
    有了经济核算制，便可以从利润和超利润计划中获得一定的奖励基金，各企业单位可以拿它做奖励优秀工作者，改善提高职工物质、文化生活和工作条件之用。我们的国家企业，政务院已规定给超利润计划的百分之三十以下做为工厂奖励基金。我们应动员全体职工努力从增加收入减少支出中多争取超计划利润，以便能多获得此项工厂奖励基金。
    生产及财务计划要交给群众，做广泛的讨论。各单位每月的财务总结要向全体职工做报告。这样便成了群众自己的东西，可以保证完成。
    四、实行严格的制度，建立明确分工的责任制
    经济核算制决定于精确的计划，也决定于适当的组织制度的保证，如独立会计制度，原始单据的统计制度及必需的监察、稽核、工资工时等组织。各种工作靠严格的监督，这种监督是靠群众的积极性与科学制度相结合来保证达到的。在实行经济核算制的条例中，具体规定：谁有什么权限，譬如单位首长可以根据计划要求的数量和质量，运用自己的所有资金，在银行设有独立账户，可以同其他单位签订合同等（这种合同不妨碍自己任务的完成，不是无组织的），谁有什么责任，那些还要负物质责任，违者罚领奖金等。该请示谁的请示谁，该谁做主的即由谁做主。这样既解放了领导干部的时间，可以多去主动的深入工作，又发挥了下边的积极性和责任心。解决问题也及时了，再不需要因为按装一个电话机，公文旅行一百七十天了。过去一个人的奖励，常常是在公文中耽误了许多时间，等奖励发下时，已经减少或者失掉了它的作用。同时组织性纪律性也会因此加强起来，因为不该谁办或不该谁做主的，也不至于乱办，乱做主而再犯错误了。
    五、加强干部学习和对全体职工的宣传
    推行经济核算制的另一件重要工作，就是要干部学会，向广大职工进行宣传并组织他们行动起来。老干部对业务不要满足于一知半解，要从熟练到精通；又要时刻注意不断提高自己的马列主义水平。新干部要继续严格批判旧的技术观点，学习与群众相结合的先进技术业务；更重要的是努力学政治学马列主义，有了马列主义，便有了武器，有了正确方向，才能发挥力量。客观要求我们能够逐渐像苏联专家那样，既是政治高明的，又是业务熟练的干部，可以预见自己工作的发展及应当解决什么问题和如何解决。毛主席曾要求老干部在三年五年之内要学会经济。应当检查一下学的结果。学会没学会，学好没学好，工作结果是最好的试题和公正无情的裁判员。学习科学的东西必须下苦工夫，马克思在资本论中就讲过，科学没有平坦大路可走，只有那不畏劳苦不畏险阻的人，有希望达到光辉的顶点。
    我们要向苏联学习，更具体的是要向中长路学习，它是苏联的先进经验与中国具体情况相结合的典型，它是一所现实的学校。派有朝气的，对新鲜事物敏感，有一定接受能力的干部和模范工作者去学习。在全面联系了解中去深入一门，把一件学透彻。有些在中长路已是寻常的东西，例如一个会怎样开法，都需要学。铁道部的各种刊物和报纸要把宣传中长路当成一个中心任务。学苏联先进经验中，要严格区别和查究，不允许把美英的或日本的东西混进去冒充，否则会害人害己。我们还要办一些训练班，训练加强经济核算工作的专门人材，如会计、计划、统计、工时工资等人员。
    通过各种形式广泛的向全体职工说明经济核算是什么，为了什么，要解决什么问题，怎样解决，对国家有什么好处，对职工有什么好处。党、行政、工会、青年团都要宣传，负责干部要亲自去讲。一面做一般的号召，一面实行个别的重点指导，（派少数得力干部，具体帮助解决某些关键问题，主要靠发挥本单位职工的积极性和掌握先进的工作方法去解决问题）这是毛主席的领导方法。在广大职工了解和行动起来，并在个别地方行之有效的基础上，由行政提出生产指标和具体保证的措施。在工会的领导下，开展为完成生产及财务计划和节约资材的群众竞赛运动。
    实行经济核算制，也是由浅入深，由没经验到有经验，由粗糙到更严密细致。经济核算制与供给制是完全相反的，它是看完成任务如何而决定支出的，一切都要按照计划进行。要在我们的干部中，清除现存的某些供给制思想，单纯完成任务的思想和不负责任的思想。使经济核算制在铁道系统中，今明两年内顺利地实行起来，和日趋巩固。
  注：
    １．人公里  一人乘车一公里为一人公里
    ２．吨公里  一吨货运行一公里为一吨公里
    ３．换算吨公里  在计算铁路运输总生产量时将人公里（以一人公里作一吨公里计算）与吨公里相加之和
    ４．严格排空  严格遵照计划排送空车
