　　We Discussed the Film "The Life of Wu Xun"
    ——A Record of the Discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun" at the Central Literary Research Institute
　　Meng Bing
    After initially watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun," our comrades at the Literary Research Institute had several different reactions:

    One view was that the film was very good. Some comrades were moved to tears. Some comrades felt "ashamed of themselves" and were in pain. An individual member of the Communist Youth League reported to the group leader: "After being educated by the film 'The Life of Wu Xun,' my thinking has improved." Some comrades believed that some of our cadres were not as good as Wu Xun and should learn from Wu Xun's "asceticism," "altruism," and "tenacity."

    Another view was that Wu Xun was still a good figure in our national history, and his "asceticism," "altruism," and "tenacious spirit" were precisely what we should emulate. However, it was felt that the film distorted this great figure in many places, exaggerating his begging and kneeling behavior, turning Wu Xun into a weak and unprincipled mediocrity.

    Another view was that Wu Xun's direction and path were wrong, but his "asceticism," "altruism," "spirit of tenacious dedication," and subjective desire to serve "poor children" were still good.

    Another view was that Wu Xun's entire history, career, spirit, and morality were wrong.

    Among these four types of people, the first and fourth types accounted for a minority.

    In mid-April, our various groups had a casual discussion on the above-mentioned differences of opinion. At that time, most comrades had begun to realize that Wu Xun was a figure who served the reactionary feudal tradition in history, but they could not systematically understand him ideologically and theoretically. In addition, there were still a few comrades who verbally admitted that Wu Xun was reactionary, but when analyzing Wu Xun's specific thoughts and actions, they still thought he was good.

    Recently, after the "People's Daily" published an editorial and a call in the "Party Life" column for "Communist Party members should participate in the criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" all the comrades of the Literary Research Institute gathered again to hold a meeting to launch a discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun." In the beginning, some comrades examined their initial understanding, and then raised the following questions: "Was Wu Xun a reformist?" "Was the screenwriter's subjective desire good?"

    Based on the above situation, in order to truly achieve ideological unity and truly solve the problem, we must first scientifically analyze, based on historical facts and the materials in the film: What kind of person was Wu Xun?

    Historical facts make it impossible for us to interpret Wu Xun as a revolutionary who "served the people" or "served poor children." On the contrary, in the history of the people's resistance to feudal rule, Wu Xun was precisely the enemy of the people, precisely a shameless lackey who betrayed his class and abjectly prostrated himself under the crotch of reactionary rulers. Why did the Qing Dynasty, the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek, and Japanese fascists all love this "flag of cultural liberation for the working people" who "served the people" and was "tenacious and unyielding" throughout his life? Could it be that Empress Dowager Cixi, Chiang Kai-shek, and Japanese fascists were all originally revolutionaries? The facts are definitely not like this. The Manchu Qing emperors praised Wu Xun precisely because Wu Xun was corroding the people's will to struggle from within the people's organism, from the level of thought.

    Wu Xun was born in a rural area of a feudal society, influenced by feudal clan ethics and fatalism. In addition, he began his vagrant life of doing odd jobs, begging, and performing acrobatics at the age of fourteen, which made him roll into the circle of ruffians and local bullies, and in his thinking, he became increasingly alienated from the class he originally came from, to the point where he completely knelt down at the feet of feudal "big shots" to beg for a living.

    His lifelong career was running free schools.

    He knew that running free schools could not be successful by one person alone. He needed the help and support of others, he needed money. However, he did not try to overthrow the feudal exploiting class and take back the money exploited from the people, nor did he rely on the people's revolution to take back the right for "poor children" to study from the feudal ruling class that had deprived them of that right. In order to get money, he did not hesitate to use extremely base means. In addition to kneeling to landlords to beg for food and doing odd jobs, he also went around acting as a matchmaker and performing acrobatics. Although he accumulated a few coins in this way, it was still not enough to run a free school with this little money. He then tried to lend money at high interest rates, exploiting farmers with a high interest rate of three percent. In addition, he bought land and rented it out, which was the main source of his funding for education. In order to ensure the income from lending interest and rent, he found Lou Junling, a martial arts graduate of the feudal class, and Yang Shufang, a literary graduate, to guarantee the management of his property. He himself said: "Poor people work, rich people guarantee, this method is foolproof." He believed that poor people would not sympathize with him for doing good deeds for poor children. Only the landlord class was enthusiastic in helping him. Later, he also knelt down to meet Zhang Yao, a more powerful backer. Zhang Yao was a meritorious official of the Qing Dynasty who suppressed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution and the Nian Rebellion in Shandong. He had killed tens of thousands of people in Luanbei, not far from Wu Xun's hometown. Later, he became the governor of Shandong. Zhang Yao used two hundred taels of treasury silver stained with the blood of the people as a fund for Wu Xun's free school, and also gave him an alms book from the official government, and ordered all levels of government to seriously assist Wu Xun in fundraising. Wu Xun used this yellow book to ostensibly solicit alms, but in reality, it was a forced extortion.

    Why did Wu Xun collude with those local tyrants and evil gentry so easily? And why were they so happy to help Wu Xun? Because he was different from ordinary working people. He did not have the same hatred of the feudal rulers as the peasants. He believed that the oppression and exploitation of the feudal aristocracy was reasonable and justified. He possessed the ideal conditions for a complete slave desired by feudal exploiters. In life, he did not demand equality with "big shots." If "big shots" scolded him or beat him, he would kneel down. He faithfully adhered to the feudal order. When grinding flour for a wealthy family, he covered his eyes like a donkey in order to "not look lewdly" at the wealthy family's women. These were not the most important issues. The important thing was that when the rule of the feudal rulers was crumbling in the face of the rising tide of peasant revolutions such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Wu Xun came out in line with their wishes. He stood in front of the peasant ranks and sang loudly: "Free school syndrome, no fire, see people, be respectful, reward money, save lives, build a free school that cannot be moved for ten thousand years." "Don't dislike more, don't dislike less, donate some money to build a free school, both famous and do good deeds, the Emperor Wenchang knows, he will surely call your children and grandchildren to ride in eight-bearer sedan chairs." He told people that poverty in life was not the result of feudal rule and exploitation, but the reason for illiteracy. He told people not to be too "fiery," not to resist, not to overthrow feudal rule, but to beg "big shots" to donate money to run a free school so that their children could study, and after studying, they would have a rich life of "riding in eight-bearer sedan chairs." If we ask in return: "So, who are the eight people carrying the sedan chair?" How do we think Wu Xun should answer? Wu Xun's position and starting point are very clear. What is the difference between his ideological foundation for running schools and the feudal rulers' nonsense about "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others"? How is this the same as our "serving the people" and "cultural liberation"? Moreover, who are the teachers who sternly teach in front of the "poor children" studying in Wu Xun's free school? Are they not the people who took the rice bowls from the parents of the "poor children"? Are they not reciting and displaying in front of them the doctrines of the feudal patriarchal society that strangled their ancestors for thousands of generations? Can these people, these books, really tell "poor children" to overthrow the rule of the landlord class?

    Wu Xun's life experience tells us that he not only tried to please the enemies of the people with his despicable and base behavior and his submission to the feudal order, but he also wanted to use the method of running free schools to promote feudal culture to corrode the people's will to struggle. He wanted to use the enjoyment conditions of "eight-bearer sedan chairs" to lure "poor children" to crawl under the crotch of feudal rulers to act as lackeys, dividing the ranks of the people to offer to the feudal ruling class, thereby obtaining his own status as a "sage" and "righteous schoolmaster" climbing into the feudal ruling class. In a word, the reactionary thought of climbing upwards was the ideological foundation of Wu Xun's running schools, and it was also the main driving force behind his running schools, as well as the essence of Wu Xun's "altruistic" spirit.

    Many comrades, after criticizing Wu Xun's reactionary essence, still believe that although Wu Xun was bad in many ways, he still had some good points, that is, his "altruistic" and "ascetic" spirit. We believe that spirit is not a super-material thing, spirit is not something that exists in isolation from society, class, and even less from a person's worldview. If we admit that the essence of Wu Xun's thoughts and his actions are reactionary, and that he starts from himself by leaving his class, then what does he still "benefit" and who is this "he"? Moreover, Wu Xun was no longer a poor man later. He already owned hundreds of acres of land and a large amount of property. He was already among the class of creditors and landlords. The poor had to pay heavy interest when they borrowed his money, and landlords had to guarantee them. What kind of "altruistic" spirit is this? How can this be compared with our communist ideology?

    Many comrades are moved by Wu Xun's "asceticism" and confuse it with the "hard struggle" of our communists. What is his "asceticism"? Not marrying a wife, eating scorpions, quickly crawling down after being punched by someone and letting them kick him again, spending his own money to make good food for the landlords to eat, standing beside them watching and drooling, not daring to eat at the same table with the landlords. In what way can this be compared with our "hard struggle"? "Asceticism" is what feudal rulers demand of their slaves. "Asceticism" means being content with inhuman life forever. "Asceticism" is the code of conduct for people who humiliate their lives and willingly act as slaves. Our "hard struggle," on the other hand, is precisely to overthrow that inhuman life and liberate ourselves from the situation of slaves, so that life can move towards the most beautiful path. Isn't this easy to understand?

    Was Wu Xun a reformist? We don't think so. What is reformism? In feudal or capitalist societies, as the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production intensifies, class struggle also intensifies. The old foundation of rule is in crisis under the impact of new forces. At this time, hypocritical conciliators appear from the camp of the old ruling class. They attempt to prevent the emergence of a new society with certain superficial changes in the form of rule, in order to continue their old rule. We call this tendency reformism. Of course, reformism often reflects within the revolutionary camp, but we will not discuss it here. From Wu Xun's life, we can see that he wanted to maintain the old feudal order without any change. The social role played by his behavior actually consolidated the old rule without reservation. It was only Liang Qichao and other reformists in the late Qing Dynasty who had praised Wu Xun, and they wanted to put a cloak of reformism on Wu Xun in order to promote themselves.

    Secondly, did the film "The Life of Wu Xun" faithfully reflect Wu Xun?

    We believe that the film "The Life of Wu Xun" distorted Wu Xun's historical facts. The historical Wu Xun did not hold up the banner of "serving the people," the historical Wu Xun did not make friends with Zhou Da, a soldier of the Taiping Army, the historical Wu Xun did not have any facts of providing disaster relief, nor did he reject the imperial gift of a yellow robe. The historical feudal ruling class did not oppose Wu Xun's behavior because Wu Xun represented the broad masses. On the contrary, the historical fact is that the people farmed, Wu Xun collected rent, he opposed the peasant revolution, he borrowed money to the poor and required the rich to guarantee, and he wore the imperial gift of a yellow robe and was complacent. The historical fact is that Wu Xun took the initiative to ask the feudal rulers to help him, otherwise his free school would not be able to run. It was precisely Wu Xun's backer Zhang Yao who killed tens of thousands of people in Shandong at one time in history. Isn't this a fact?

    So, why did the author distort these facts? We believe that the main reason is the author's ideological problem. The author has the set of reactionary ideas shown in the film, and this idea is similar to the idea of Wu Xun in history, so he borrowed Wu Xun, such a dead person, to promote the author's own ideas; If Wu Xun was moved out unchanged, I am afraid that he would not be able to stand in front of the audience in the new China, so the author borrowed our "serving the people" as a fig leaf for Wu Xun, so the author boldly deleted and changed historical facts, hiding Wu Xun's most shameful things, and trying to beautify it, and even in order to beautify this reactionary element, he did not hesitate to distort the actions of the Taiping Army, using the failure of the Taiping Army to set off the success of Wu Xun. What does this mean? Isn't it to better deceive our people, so as to achieve the author's predetermined effect at the time of creation, and ideologically resist today's revolutionary reality?

    Some people say that the creative method of this film is worth learning, not dogmatic. We believe that the creative method of this film is as bad as its theme. We saw that the author had no ability to deal with the problem of the driving force behind Wu Xun's running schools, so he assumed a scene of sleepwalking in paradise. What kind of technique is this? Haven't we seen that many bad creations often rely on this set of gods and ghosts to solve problems when they are unable to express a problem with real life? Isn't this precisely the anti-realist technique that has long been denied by history? Isn't this precisely the old formula of feudal culture?

    Finally, we also examined ourselves. The reason why we were initially moved by this film was due to the following mistakes and shortcomings on our part: (1) In the past, we did not pay attention to the study of history, and we were not familiar with many histories of the past. Many comrades only knew that China had Wu Xun after watching the movie. (2) Most of us were from petty-bourgeois intellectuals. Although we have been tempered by years of struggle, our ideological transformation is not thorough. Unprincipled sentimentalism and individualistic emotions still exist quite seriously, so we are most easily affected by reformist ideas and are paralyzed by the idea of enmity with the people. (3) We do not pay enough attention to theoretical study, or our understanding of theory is limited to dogmatic understanding, and we are not good at using Marxist-Leninist theory to analyze practical historical problems.

    At present, our study of The Life of Wu Xun is only the beginning, especially the criticism of the film and our own thoughts, which needs to be continued and deepened. We must find out what losses the screening of the film The Life of Wu Xun has caused to our people? What are the motives, positions and effects of the author's creation, and what are the problems with the author's creative ideas and methods? We also need to further find our mistakes and find lessons from the ideological situation reflected in this discussion, so as to strengthen our ideological struggle on the literary and artistic front. The above situation is only a preliminary understanding. (Reprinted from the fourth issue of the fourth volume of the Literary and Art Gazette)

### 我们讨论了电影《武训传》——记中央文学研究所对《武训传》的讨论

　　我们讨论了电影《武训传》
    ——记中央文学研究所对《武训传》的讨论
　　孟冰
    我们文学研究所的同志们，最初看过影片《武训传》之后，曾发现了这样几种不同的反映：
    一种认为这部片子很好。有几个同志曾感动得流下泪来。有同志曾感到“自愧勿如”而痛苦。有个别青年团员向小组长汇报：“经过影片武训传教育后，自己思想提高了。”有同志认为我们有些干部还比不上武训，应当学习武训的“苦行”、“利他”和“顽强”精神。
    一种认为武训还是我们民族历史上一个好人物，他的“苦行”、“利他”和“顽强”精神正是我们的标榜。只是认为影片在许多地方把这个伟大人物丑化了，夸张了他的乞求下跪的行为，使武训变成了软弱与丧失气节的庸人。
    一种认为武训的方向、道路是错误的，可是他的“苦行”、“利他”、“坚韧的事业精神”、“为穷孩子”服务的主观愿望还是好的。
    一种认为武训的全部历史、事业、精神道德都是错误的。
    在这四种人里面，第一、四种占少数。
    四月中旬，我们各小组曾就以上的分歧意见，进行过一次漫谈，这时，大部分同志已开始知道了武训在历史上是一个服务于反动封建传统的人物，但是还不能从思想上、理论上有系统地认识他。另外还有少数同志，口头上承认武训是反动的，可是分析到武训的具体思想和行动的时候，仍然认为他是好的。
    最近，《人民日报》发表社论和党的生活栏提出“共产党员应当参加关于《武训传》的批判”的号召后，全文学研究所的同志又集中开会展开对《武训传》的讨论。开始，一部分同志检讨了自己最初的认识，接着又提出这样一些疑问：“武训是否改良主义者？”“电影剧本的作者的主观愿望是否好的？”
    根据以上情况，要在思想上真正求得认识一致，真正解决问题，首先必须根据历史事实和影片中的材料科学地分析：武训究竟是怎样一个人。
    历史上的事实使我们无论怎样也不能把武训解释成“为人民服务”“为穷孩子”服务的革命者，相反的，在人民反抗封建统治的历史上，武训正是人民的敌人，正是出卖自己阶级而卑贱地屈身于反动统治者胯下的无耻的奴才。为什么清朝、民国、蒋介石、日本法西斯，都是那样喜爱这个“为人民服务”而一生“坚韧不屈”的“劳动人民文化翻身的旗帜”呢？难道慈禧、蒋介石、日本法西斯也本来都是革命的不成？事实绝不是这样。满清皇帝褒奖武训，正是因为武训从人民机体内部，从思想上腐蚀着人民的斗争意志。
    武训生在封建社会的农村，受封建的宗法道德和宿命论的薰陶，加上他十四岁便开始了打短工、讨吃、耍把戏的游民生活，使他又滚进了流氓地痞的圈子，在思想上也就越来越远离了自己本来出身的阶级，以至完全跪倒在封建“大人们”的脚下去乞讨求生。
    他一生的事业就是办义学。
    他知道办义学不是一个人所能成功的，他需要他人的帮助和支持，他需要钱。可是，他不是去打倒封建剥削阶级、从那里拿回人民被剥削的血汗钱，也不是去依靠人民革命、从那些剥夺了“穷孩子”读书权利的封建统治阶级那里夺回他们孩子读书的权利来。他为了钱不惜用极下流的手段，除了给地主下跪讨吃、打短工之外，还到处说媒、耍把戏。这样虽然积了几文钱，想凭这一点钱办义学还是不行的，他便设法放高利贷，用三分钱的重利盘剥农民，此外又买了土地出租，这才是他兴学经费的主要来源。为了保证放账利息和地租的收入，他就找了封建阶级的一个武进士娄峻岭和一个文进士杨树芳给他作保经营财产。他自己说：“穷人使，富人保，这个办法错不了。”他认为为穷孩子作好事穷人不会同情他，反而只有地主阶级才是帮助他的热心家。后来他还跪见了一个更有势的靠山张曜。张曜是清朝镇压太平天国革命和镇压山东捻党暴动的功臣，曾在离武训家乡不远的鲁安北一次杀人上万，后来作了山东巡抚。张曜曾用二百两沾渍着人民血迹的库银给武训作义学的基金，还给了他官府的化缘簿，并下令大小官府都要认真协助武训募捐，武训也就借助这个黄簿子名叫化缘，实际上是强讨。
    为什么武训竟那样容易的勾结上那些土豪劣绅？而他们又那样乐于来帮助武训呢？因为他不同于一般劳动人民，他没有农民对封建统治者那样的仇恨，他认为封建贵族的压迫剥削是合理的、应该的。他具有着封建剥削者所理想的完备的奴才条件。他在生活上不要求和“大人”平等，“大人”骂他打他，他会下跪。他忠实地恪守封建秩序，给财主家磨面的时候，他像驴子样把自己的眼蒙起来，为了“目不邪视”财主家的女人。这些还不是最要紧的问题，要紧的是当时封建统治者的统治面对着太平天国等风起云涌的农民革命而摇摇欲坠的时候，武训正顺着他们的心钻了出来，他站在农民队伍的面前高唱：“义学症，没火性，见了人，把礼敬，赏了钱，活了命，修个义学万年不能动。”“不嫌多，不嫌少，舍些金钱修义学，又有名，又行好，文昌帝君知道了，准叫你子子孙孙坐八抬大轿。”他告诉人们生活的贫困不是封建统治剥削的结果，而是不识字的原因。他告诉人们，不要太“火性”，不要反抗，不要推翻封建统治，还是好好求“大人们”布施钱办个义学，让子孙去读书，读了书就有“坐八抬大轿”的丰足生活。假若我们反问一句：“那么，那八个抬轿的是谁呢？”我们想武训该怎样回答呢？武训的立场和出发点在那里是很显然的。他兴学的思想基础和封建统治者的“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的鬼话有什么区别呢？这和我们的为“人民服务”、“文化翻身”有那一点相同呢？况且，站在武训的义学求学的“穷孩子”面前严声厉色的教师是谁呢？不正是那些从“穷孩子”父母手里夺去饭碗的人吗？他们口里念的，面前摆的不正是那些曾经扼死他们千世万代祖宗生命的封建宗法社会的教义吗？难道这些人，这些书，真会告诉“穷孩子”去推翻地主阶级的统治吗？
    武训一生的经历告诉我们，他不但想法用自己的卑劣下贱的行为和对封建秩序的俯首是从来取悦于人民的敌人，他还想用办义学宣扬封建文化的方法，腐蚀人民的斗争意志，他想用“八抬大轿”的享受条件诱惑“穷孩子”爬到封建统治者的胯下去充作爪牙，分化人民的队伍以献供于封建统治阶级，从而取得自己爬进封建统治阶级的“圣人”“义学正”的地位。一句话，往上爬的反动思想就是武训兴学的思想基础，也是他兴学的主要推动力，也是武训“利他”精神的实质。
    许多同志在批判了武训的反动实质之后，还认为武训虽然很多地方是坏的，他总还有一点好处，那就是他的“利他”和“苦行”精神。我们认为精神并非超物质的东西，精神不是离开社会、阶级，更不是离开一个人的宇宙观而孤立存在的东西，假若承认武训思想本质和他的行动效果是反动的，是离开自己的阶级而从自我出发的时候，他还是“利”什么“他”？这“他”是谁呢？况且武训后来已经不是什么穷人了，他已经拥有了几百亩的土地和大量的财产，他已经列身于债主和地主的阶级之中了。穷人借了他的钱要重利盘剥，要地主作保，这叫什么“利他”精神？这和我们的共产主义思想有那一点能够相比呢？
    许多同志为武训的“苦行”感动，把它和我们共产党人的“艰苦奋斗”相混淆。什么是他的“苦行”？不娶老婆、吃蝎子、别人打一拳就赶快爬下再让别人踢一脚，自己出钱作好饭让地主吃，自己站在旁边看着淌口水，不敢去和地主同桌吃饭。这在那一点上能和我们的“艰苦奋斗”相提并论呢？“苦行”是封建统治者对自己的奴才的要求，“苦行”就是永远安于非人的生活，“苦行”是污辱人生的甘作奴才的人们的处世操行。而我们的“艰苦奋斗”，正是为了推翻那种非人的生活，而把自己从奴隶的境遇里解放出来，使生活走向最美好的路途。难道这不是很容易理解的吗？
    武训是否改良主义者呢？我们认为不是。所谓改良主义是什么呢？在封建社会或资本主义社会里，由于生产力与生产关系的矛盾日益尖锐化，阶级斗争也随着尖锐化，旧的统治基础在新的力量冲击下发生了危机，这时便从旧统治阶级阵营出现了虚伪的调和派，他们企图用某些统治形式的表面的改变来阻止新社会的出现，以便继续其旧的统治，我们把这种倾向叫做改良主义。当然改良主义也往往会反映于革命阵营之中的，这里且不去谈它。我们从武训的生平来看，他是要毫不变动的保持旧封建秩序的，他的行为所起的社会作用实际是毫不保留地巩固了旧的统治。只是满清后期的梁启超等改良主义分子也曾表扬武训，他们想给武训披上改良主义的外衣来替自己宣传。
    其次，电影《武训传》是否忠实地反映了武训呢？
    我们认为电影《武训传》是歪曲了武训的历史事实的。历史上的武训并没有撑着“为人民服务”的招牌，历史上的武训也并未和什么太平军的战士周大交朋友，历史上的武训并没有救济灾荒的事实，也没有拒绝过什么御赐黄马褂，历史上的封建统治阶级也并不是因为武训代表了什么广大群众，而不敢反对武训的行为。历史上的太平天国革命也不是杀人放火。历史事实相反是人民种地，武训收租，他反对农民革命，他借钱给穷人要富人保，他穿了御赐黄马褂而洋洋自得。历史事实是武训自动去求封建统治者帮助他，否则他的义学就办不成。历史上在山东一次杀人上万的正是武训的靠山张曜。难道这不是事实吗？
    那么，为什么作者要把这些事实歪曲了呢？我们认为原因主要地是作者的思想问题，作者具有电影中所显示的那一套反动思想，而这个思想正和历史上武训的思想相近似，所以他便借了武训这样一个死去的人来宣扬作者自己的思想；假如把武训原封不动地搬出来，恐怕在新中国的观众的面前是不能站脚的，于是作者便把我们的“为人民服务”借给武训作了遮羞牌，于是作者便大胆删改历史事实，把武训那些最见不得人的东西隐藏起来，尽量地把它美化，甚至为了美化这个反动分子，不惜歪曲太平军的行动，用太平军的失败来衬托武训的成功。这是什么意思呢？难道不是为了更好欺骗我们的人民，以达到作者创作时预定的效果，从思想上抵抗今天的革命现实吗？
    有人说这部片子的创作方法上，值得学习，不是公式主义的。我们认为这部片子在创作方法上也同他的主题思想一样的恶劣。我们看见作者没有能力来处理武训兴学的动力问题，于是假设了梦游天堂的场面。这是一种什么手法呀？我们不曾看见过许多恶劣的创作都常常在没能力用现实生活来表现一个问题的时候，总是靠着这一套什么神呀鬼呀来解决问题的吗？难道这不正是早为历史所否定了的反现实主义的手法吗？这不正是封建文化的老公式吗？
    最后，我们也检讨了自己。我们其所以最初会被这部片子所感动，是由于我们存在以下的错误和缺点：（一）过去不重视历史学习，对过去许多历史不熟悉，许多同志看过电影后才知道中国还有过武训其人。（二）我们大部分是小资产阶级知识分子出身，虽经多年斗争锻炼，思想改造还不彻底，无原则的温情主义，个人主义情绪还相当严重的存在，因而最容易受改良主义思想的影响，对人民的敌对思想麻痹。（三）对理论学习重视还不够，或者对理论还只限于教条的理解，不善于用马克思列宁主义理论来分析历史实际问题。
    目前我们对武训传的学习还只是开始，尤其对电影和对自己的思想批判，还需要继续深入。我们必须弄清楚电影《武训传》的放映给了我们人民一些什么损失？作者创作的动机、立场和效果、作者创作思想和方法上究竟存在些什么问题？我们还要从这一讨论中所反映的思想情况来进一步找到我们的错误，找到教训，以加强我们在文艺战线上的思想斗争。以上情况，还仅只是初步的认识。（转载文艺报四卷四期）
