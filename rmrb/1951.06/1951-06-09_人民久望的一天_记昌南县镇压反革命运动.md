Changan County (formerly southern Changyi), Shandong Province, was the area where the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, along with landlords and local bullies, most cruelly slaughtered the people when they launched their key offensive against the liberated areas of Shandong. In the short period from August to October 1947 alone, more than three thousand people were killed. This debt of blood and tears has been weighing on the people's hearts ever since. Many counter-revolutionaries continued to do evil after Changan was liberated.

After the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched in Changan with great fanfare, the county held an exhibition of the murder weapons and cartoons collected from the enemy. The exhibition displayed guillotines for beheading, knives for digging out hearts and skinning people, ropes for hanging people, red-hot iron rods for branding, nail beds, blood-stained clothing, and the bones of the deceased; there were also cartoons depicting the crimes of counter-revolutionary bandits, such as burning people with kerosene, "dismembering by five oxen," "lighting sky lanterns," burying people alive, and raping women. Although this exhibition was not large in scale, many people could not bear to finish watching it and left in tears. This is part of what the Kuomintang bandits called the "model deeds" of their "model county."

Although the bloody years have passed, the people have never forgotten these irreconcilable enemies, nor the last words of the victims. When Zhang Li, the women's chairman of Yinma Village, and her fifteen-year-old daughter were buried alive by the enemy, the daughter, reluctant to leave her young life, refused to jump into the pit. The mother then told her, "Child, come down! One day, someone will avenge you."

The people of Changan were mobilized during the land reform and the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and actively fought against counter-revolutionaries. On the eve of arresting counter-revolutionaries before the Qingming Festival, farmers' representative meetings were held in all townships throughout the county to discuss the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Everyone discussed the issues seriously and earnestly. Some suggested: Fight tigers at the front, fight wolves at the rear. Others said: Better to get rid of the thief in your own home than fear outside bandits. They discussed which counter-revolutionaries should be killed, which should be imprisoned, and which should be placed under surveillance. Everyone was in high spirits and made rules for monitoring counter-revolutionaries and maintaining confidentiality. When Xin Zhao Township was discussing the counter-revolutionaries who should be arrested, Wang Haoxue, the older brother of the murderer Wang Haowen, and a farmer himself, also attended the meeting. He said, "I am responsible for monitoring this bastard; he is no longer my brother." As a result of the masses' discussion, none of the counter-revolutionaries who were supposed to be arrested escaped.

On Qingming Festival, the people of all districts and townships in Changan unanimously demanded that the government punish the counter-revolutionary criminals on this day. The People's Government accepted the people's demands, and people's courts were organized in all districts throughout the county. On this day, 60,000 people in all districts first paid tribute to the fallen martyrs and their murdered relatives, and then made accusations in the courts of each district. When the farmers of Rigezhuang in the Ninth District were accusing the murderous local tyrant Zhao Yurong, the mother of the murdered farmer Jiang Shiguo accused him, saying, "Zhao Yurong, you killed my son, and my eyes have been blinded by crying. Today I will not hit you or scold you; I will just touch you to see if you are even human." The people poured out the deep hatred buried in their hearts, word by word, tear by tear. Letters of opinion and accusations poured into the court like snowflakes. A surge of anger demanding the resolute suppression of counter-revolutionaries swept through the venue.

The people's courts upheld justice and, in accordance with the law, executed Guo Bingjian, the fierce criminal who ripped out the hearts of three living people with his own hands, and Yu Shujian, the local bully who inserted a hand grenade into the genitals of the village women's chairman and blew her up. Fourteen counter-revolutionaries with lesser crimes were sentenced to prison terms, and over twenty who should be placed under supervision were handed over to the people for control. The farmers said, "The Kuomintang reactionaries killed as they pleased; we distinguish between the severity of crimes and treat them differently." After dealing with this group of counter-revolutionaries, the farmers were overjoyed, and they shouted, "Chairman Mao's sun shines on our door!"

After the stone weighing on the hearts of the people of Changan was removed, the countryside was filled with a new atmosphere. During the grand May Day celebrations, seventy-year-old elders also participated in the Yangko dance. The people put Chairman Mao's portrait in a sedan chair and paraded through the streets. The farmers enthusiastically responded to all the government's calls and tirelessly engaged in production. The county's task of planting 60,000 mu of cotton resulted in 108,000 mu being planted. The farmers called the cotton they planted "patriotic cotton" and "resist-America cotton." The wheat has been weeded three to four times in some places. The farmers are mobilizing 25,000 laborers to repair the river. In Xin Zhao Township, where the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was done best, the farmers organized a Yangko team and sent the laborers to the river.

　　人民久望的一天
    ——记昌南县镇压反革命运动
    新华社记者  剑秋
    山东省昌南县（原昌邑南部），是蒋匪军在山东重点进攻解放区时，与地主、恶霸一起向人民进行屠杀最残酷的地区。仅在一九四七年八月到十月的短短时间，被杀害的人民即在三千以上。这笔血泪交凝的仇恨，在人民的心里一直压到现在。不少反革命分子在昌南解放后仍继续作恶。
    镇压反革命运动在昌南大张旗鼓地展开以后，县里曾搜集了敌人杀人的凶器和漫画举行过一次展览。展览会陈列有铡人的铡刀，挖人心、剥人皮的刀子，绞人的绳子，烙人的火柱，钉子床，血衣，死难者的碎骨；还有用火油烧、“五牛分尸”、“点天灯”、活埋、奸污妇女等反革命匪徒罪行的漫画。这个展览会虽规模不大，但很多人都不忍看完就含泪退出了。这就是国民党匪徒们所说的他们的“模范县”的“模范事迹”的一部。
    血的岁月虽已过去，但人民对这些不共戴天的仇人，对死难者最后的声音，却时刻未忘。饮马村妇女会长张李氏和她十五岁的女儿被敌人活埋时，女儿留恋着她的青春的生命，不肯跳下坑去。母亲便告诉她：“孩子下来吧！有一天，有人会给你报仇的。”
    昌南人民在土地改革和抗美援朝运动中动员起来，积极和反革命分子进行斗争。在清明节前逮捕反革命分子的前夜，全县各乡都举行了农民代表会，讨论镇压反革命。大家严肃认真地进行讨论。有的提出：前方打虎，后方打狼。有的说：除了家贼，不怕外盗。他们讨论什么样的反革命分子该杀，什么样的该关，什么样的该管。大家情绪很高，并订出监视反革命分子和保密纪律。辛赵乡在讨论应当逮捕的反革命分子时，杀人凶犯王好文的亲哥、农民王好学也参加了会议。他说：“我负责监视这个坏蛋，他不是我的弟弟。”经过群众讨论后应逮捕的反革命分子，由于群众的监督而无一漏网。
    清明节这天，昌南各区各乡的人民一致要求政府要在这天惩办反革命罪犯。人民政府接受了人民的要求，全县各区都组织了人民法庭。这天全县各区共有六万人首先公祭了死难烈士和被杀害的亲人，接着在各区的法庭上进行了控诉。第九区日戈庄的农民在控诉杀人的恶霸地主赵玉荣时，被害农民姜士果的母亲控诉道：“赵玉荣，你杀了我的儿，我的眼也哭瞎了，今天我不打你、不骂你，我摸一摸你是不是个人。”人民将埋在心里的血海深仇，一字一泪地控诉出来。意见书和诉状像雪片一样地送到法庭上。会场上卷起了一片坚决镇压反革命的怒涛。
    人民法庭伸张正义，依法将一手扒了三个活人心的凶犯郭丙建，用手雷插入生殖器内炸死村妇女会长的恶霸地主于述前等处决，将十四个罪恶较轻的反革命分子分别判处徒刑，将二十几名应管制的分子交给人民管制。农民们说：国民党反动派是占味就杀，我们是分别罪恶大小，不同对待。在处理了这一批反革命分子后，农民高兴万分，他们纷纷高呼：“毛主席的太阳照到咱的家门了。”
    压在昌南人民心里的石头搬掉之后，农村充满一片新的气象。在盛大的五一节时，七十岁的老人也参加了扭秧歌。人民把毛主席像放在花轿里抬着游行。农民们热烈响应政府的一切号召，不倦地进行生产。全县种六万亩棉花的任务，结果种了十万八千亩。农民把种的棉花叫做爱国棉、抗美棉。小麦有的已锄到三遍到四遍。农民们正动员二万五千个民工修河。镇压反革命做得最好的辛赵乡，农民组织了秧歌队一直把民工送到河上。
