　　Northwest China Party Organizations
    Universally Establish Reporting System
    Party organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in Northwest China have universally established a reporting system, and reporters in various places have already begun their work. Among the 53 city-level reporters determined by the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPC, 31, including Zhao Boping, the secretary of the Municipal Committee, made 64 reports to municipal-level cadres, propagandists, representatives from all walks of life, people from all sectors of society, and suburban farmers in April. Among the 35 district-level reporters, 15 made 31 reports to district propagandists, citizens, and farmers. The 22 provincial-level reporters determined by the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the CPC, including Pan Zili, the secretary of the Provincial Committee, have made 15 reports to people from all walks of life on current affairs and policy issues. In addition to making three reports to cadres, Provincial Committee Secretary Pan Zili also made three reports to migrant workers repairing canals along the Yellow River in the province. Many county Party secretaries, heads of county propaganda departments, and Party member cadres serving as county heads in the province serve as reporters at the county level. The Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC has determined 30 people, including Sub-bureau Secretary Wang Zhen, as provincial-level reporters. The Sub-bureau has instructed all parts of the province to establish county-level and higher reporters before June. The reporters of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, including Provincial Committee Secretary Ma Mingfang, have made reports to provincial-level agency cadres on issues such as land reform, current affairs, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Before May 1st, the reporters in Baoji Prefecture and Yan'an and other places in the province made reports in rural areas, factories, and schools on issues related to the May 1st demonstration, signing, and voting. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC has determined 34 people, including Provincial Committee Secretary Zhang Desheng, as provincial-level reporters. The Qinghai Provincial Committee has determined 25 people, including Provincial Committee Secretary Zhang Zhongliang, as provincial-level reporters. Xining City and Huzhu, Datong, Ledu, Guide, and other counties in the province have also established reporters. (Xinhua News Agency)
