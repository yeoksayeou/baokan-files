　　Long Live the Brotherly Solidarity of the Chinese and German Peoples!
　　John Koenig, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China, with the rank of Ambassador
　　Since the great socialist October Revolution of 1917 – the moment of birth of the powerful Soviet Union – the Soviet Union has been born, grown, and strengthened in the struggle for peaceful construction, the struggle against imperialist oppression, and the struggle against imperialist wars, and the movement of the people to defend peace has thus forever become an increasingly powerful and conscious movement. Today, this organized peace front, including hundreds of millions of people across the globe, can be considered the first in human history. Leading this camp is the great Soviet Union, which has consistently strived tirelessly, fearlessly, and loyally for the cause of peace. All forces in the peace camp not only see her as a reliable and invincible fortress, but also respect her as the best teacher and friend. She is the inexhaustible source of strength for the struggle of peace-loving people. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the peace camp will surely be victorious. This country has freed itself from the system of exploitation, imperialist oppression, and the terror of war, and its great success can give other countries still groaning under imperialist enslavement new courage and new strength in the struggle for national independence, peace, and democracy. In the people's democratic countries from the Elbe to the Pacific, the brotherly unity of all peoples is jointly built on the solid foundation of friendship with the Soviet Union.
　　The friendship between the Chinese and German brothers in this national family plays an important role in the development of the world peace camp. As Chairman Mao Zedong said in his congratulatory message celebrating the founding of the German Democratic Republic: "The people's Germany and the people's China are both at the forefront of the great struggle against imperialism."
　　This time, American imperialism invaded free Korea, burning and killing everywhere. The Chinese People's Volunteers, fighting alongside the Korean People's Army, dealt the aggressors a severe blow. This struggle is also directly related to the German people. Every German patriot regards this as their own affair. Because American imperialism is also the main enemy of the German people, just as it is the enemy of the Chinese and Korean people. The American war instigator McCloy once said: "The mission we have undertaken in Germany is no different from the actions our troops are taking in Korea." In his shameless words, he showed how similar the issue of national independence is in our common struggle front.
　　Premier Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic, in his government message on November 15th last year, gave an appropriate reply to this provocative statement:
　　"We feel that we are united with the Korean people who are fighting for freedom; we express our sympathy to them, and we lodge a serious protest against the American imperialism's violation of international law in interfering with the lives of the Korean people, against the American imperialism's aggression mania, and against the American imperialism's inhumane war actions.
　　American imperialism is a war instigator and arms supplier in its actions to oppress the colonial people who are fighting for freedom. Its ultimate goal is to strive to establish a rule of enslavement in all regions of the world. It is this imperialism that is now illegally invading the People's Republic of China and threatening China's security... The German Democratic Republic is uniting all peace-loving people to fight to prevent new aggression by imperialism...
　　The government of the German Democratic Republic is willing to give full and unlimited support to all forces participating in the struggle for peace, equal rights, and friendship between nations, especially the forces whose goals are the World Peace Movement and the National Front of Democratic Germany. Their struggle is our struggle! Their victory is our victory!"
　　The above words were said by Premier Grotewohl a month after the National Front of Democratic Germany's candidates won an overwhelming victory in the general election in the German Democratic Republic. This victory demonstrated the failure of American imperialism's policy of preparing for war in Germany. At the same time, he pointed out how strongly the masses of the people trust the peaceful policies of the German Democratic Republic, and that the founding of the German Democratic Republic is a turning point in European history. The German people understand very well that peace is indivisible, and they must strive for peace in Asia as well as in Europe. Therefore, when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the heroic Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, defeated the domestic and foreign enemies of the people, this historic victory filled every kind-hearted German patriot with joy and enthusiasm. At the same time, Democratic Germany also believes that the birth of New China is an important historical event since the glorious Soviet Red Army defeated German and Japanese fascism. The people of our country pay great attention and concern to the progress and success of our Chinese brothers and comrades-in-arms. Such a high degree of interest and great joy shown in every event consciously expresses how closely all actions and victories are related to each other in the struggle of our two peoples. Every achievement that Chinese brothers have made in economic construction, in opposing the remilitarization of Japan, and in assisting Korea is equally respected by the German people, just as they have fought victorious battles on the road to completing the Five-Year Plan, in fighting against the remilitarization of West Germany, and in striving for a unified Germany. In recent days, the people of Democratic Germany have particularly shared in the joy of the great Chinese people in reaching a successful agreement on the liberation of Tibet.
　　The friendship between China and Germany is not only significant in the political field, but also in the economic and trade fields, the Chinese and German peoples have common interests. Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and Director of the Financial and Economic Commission, once pointed out that the "Sino-German Trade Agreement" signed on October 10, 1950, is an important symbol of the friendly economic cooperation between the Chinese and German peoples. The implementation of the agreement means a great help to the economic construction of both countries. The workers and engineers, technicians and economists of the German Democratic Republic will do everything possible to express their confidence through work, this confidence which the People's Republic of China gives a great deal of assistance. They also realize that every positive economic assistance given by the great Chinese people is the real strengthening of their strength that they need, and it is also one of the strongest fortresses of the world peace camp. In terms of the opposite aspect of economic assistance (the German Democratic Republic has received economic assistance from friends in the Far East), Vice Premier Ulbricht said at the Third Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany amidst thunderous cheers from the delegates: "No one can deny that: Germany, which is united in friendship with the powerful People's Republic of China, has a great possibility of making its economy increasingly prosperous."
　　The important raw materials and food supplied to us by China are of particular value to the completion of our Five-Year Plan and the strengthening of the economic and political strength of the German Democratic Republic. This kind of strengthening again means that the imperialist policy of the British and Americans has suffered another new defeat.
　　In the work of enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding between the two peoples, attention to cultural ties occupies an important position. Vice Premier Guo Moruo, at the meeting of the World Peace Council, paid tribute to the German people and their country as the homeland of Marx, Engels, Goethe, Kant, and Hegel on behalf of the 475 million Chinese men and women. On the other hand, the high culture of China is also highly respected by the German people. When the Chinese Art Exhibition opened in Berlin on May 15 this year, President Pieck personally attended, and Vice Premier Ulbricht regarded it as one of the important events in politics, art, and science. He believes that this exhibition is a testament to the close unity between the Chinese and German peoples, and through this unity, the German people are encouraged in their struggle for peace and unity.
　　The German people, especially the German cultural workers, hope that the continued development of cultural exchanges will enable them to gain particularly valuable fruits in their struggle to preserve and promote the cultural heritage created by their nation.
　　The Chinese and German people, like other people in the world, love peace. At the same time, they fully understand that love of peace must be combined with an indomitable and resolute will to actively defend peace. They know that peace can only be maintained and consolidated if the people realize Stalin's words: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of defending peace and defend this cause to the end." The active cooperation between the Chinese and German peoples in the political, economic, and cultural fields is a sharp weapon in the struggle against American imperialism. The consolidation of our two countries' friendship is a contribution to defending peace and also a contribution to the continued strengthening of the invincible world peace front.
　　Long live the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples! Long live the heroic Chinese people and their leader Comrade Mao Zedong! (Translated by Huang Xianjun)

　　中德人民的兄弟般的团结万岁！
    德意志民主共和国驻华外交使团大使衔团长  约翰·柯尼希
    自从一九一七年伟大的社会主义十月革命——强大的苏联的诞生时辰——以来，苏联便在为和平建设的斗争、为反抗帝国主义的压迫及反对帝国主义战争的斗争中诞生、成长和强大起来，而人民保卫和平的运动也从此永远成为日益壮大和自觉的运动。今天，这一个有组织的和平阵线，包括全地球上数万万人民的阵线，可算人类有史以来的第一次。领导这一个阵营的，就是始终为和平事业作不倦、无畏和忠诚的奋斗的伟大的苏联。和平阵营的所有力量不但把她看做可靠和不可战胜的堡垒，而且同时尊奉她为最良好的导师和朋友。她便是爱好和平的人民斗争力量的无穷尽的源泉。在苏联的领导下，和平阵营一定会得到胜利的。这一个国家摆脱了剥削制度、帝国主义的压迫和战争恐怖，她所得到的巨大成功，可以给予仍在帝国主义奴役下呻吟的其他国家，在为国家独立、和平与民主的斗争中以新的勇气和新的力量。在从易北河到太平洋的人民民主国家中，所有人民的兄弟般的团结，都共同建立在与苏联友谊的巩固基础上。
    中德两国兄弟在这个民族大家庭内的友谊，对于世界和平阵营的发展，起了一个重要的作用。诚如毛泽东主席在庆祝德意志民主共和国成立的贺电里所说的：“人民的德国和人民的中国同处在反对帝国主义的伟大斗争的最前线。”
    这一次美国帝国主义侵入自由的朝鲜，到处焚烧屠杀，中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，给侵略者以严重的打击。这个斗争与德国人民也有直接的关系。每一个德国爱国者都把这当作自己的事情。因为美帝国主义也是德国人民的主要敌人，如同她是中朝人民的敌人一样。美国战争挑拨者麦克洛埃曾说过：“我们在德国所负的使命，与我们军队在朝鲜所采取的行动毫无二致。”在他的无耻言辞中，就表明了摆在我们的共同斗争阵线上的国家独立问题是何等的相像。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥，在去年十一月十五日的政府文告中，对这挑衅的言论曾给予适当的答复：
    “我们感觉到，我们是与为自由而斗争的朝鲜人民团结一致的；我们向他们表示同情，并为反对美帝国主义对朝鲜人民生活的违反国际公法的干涉，反对美帝国主义的侵略狂，并反对美帝国主义的无人道的战争行动，提出严重的抗议。
    美帝国主义在压迫为自由而斗争的殖民地人民的行动中，是战争煽动者和军火供应者。它最后的目的，是要努力在世界各地区建立一个奴役的统治。就是这一个帝国主义，现正非法地侵略中华人民共和国，并威胁了中国的安全……德意志民主共和国正在联合所有爱好和平的人民，为预防帝国主义的新的侵略行动而斗争……
    凡是参加为和平、平等权利和各民族间的友谊而斗争的一切力量，尤其是以世界和平运动和民主德国全国阵线为目标的力量，德意志民主共和国政府愿给予全力和无限的支持。他们的斗争就是我们的斗争！他们的胜利就是我们的胜利！”
    以上的话，是总理格罗提渥在德意志民主共和国举行普选时，民主德国全国阵线的候选人得到压倒的胜利后一个月说的。这个胜利，表明了美帝国主义在德国准备战争的政策的失败。同时，他指出人民群众如何强烈地信任德意志民主共和国的和平政策，而且德意志民主共和国的成立便是欧洲历史的转折点。德国人民非常了解，和平是不可分割的，他们在亚洲和在欧洲一样必须争取和平。因此，当中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的英勇的共产党领导下战胜了国内外的人民敌人，这一个历史性的胜利却给每一个善良的德国爱国者充满了喜悦和热情。同时，民主德国也认为新中国的诞生，便是光荣的苏联红军战胜德日法西斯以来的一桩重要的历史事件。我们国家的人民，对于中国兄弟们和战友们的进展和成功，寄予极大的注意和关切。像这样对每一桩事件所表现的高度兴趣和巨大喜悦，便是自觉地表示在我们两国人民的斗争中，所有行动和胜利彼此多么密切地关连着。中国兄弟们无论在经济建设、在反对日本的重新军国主义化和在援助朝鲜中所得到的每一成就，德国人民都同样地表示敬意，正如他们在完成五年计划的道路上、在为反对西德的重新军国主义化和为争取统一的德意志的斗争中所打的胜仗一样。在最近几天，伟大的中国人民对于解放西藏得到圆满的协议，民主德国的人民也特别分受了这种欢欣。
    中德两国的友谊，不仅在政治领域上具有意义，而且在经济和贸易的领域上，中德人民也有共通的利益的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府副总理兼财政经济委员会主任陈云，曾经指出一九五○年十月十日签订的《中德贸易协定》是中德两国人民的友好经济合作的重要标志。协定的实行，对于两国的经济建设方面，意味着一个巨大的帮助。德意志民主共和国的工人和工程师、技术人员和经济学家，将尽一切努力，通过工作来表现他们的信心，这信心使中华人民共和国给予许多援助。对于这一点，他们也领会到，伟大的中国人民所给予每一种积极的经济援助，就是他们所需要的真正的加强力量，这也是世界和平阵营的最强固的堡垒之一。就经济援助（德意志民主共和国曾从远东朋友方面得到经济援助）的相反方面而论，副总理乌布利希在德意志统一社会党第三届代表大会上在各代表的欢声雷动的欢呼中这样说过：“没有人能够否认：和强大的中华人民共和国友好地团结一起的德意志，大有可能使经济日趋繁荣。”
    中国所供给我们的重要原料和粮食，对于完成我们的五年计划和加强德意志民主共和国的经济政治，都有它的特殊价值的。这一种加强再度意味着，英美的帝国主义政策又得到一个新的失败。
    在增进两国人民的友谊和彼此了解的工作中，对于文化联系的注意却占着重要的地位。副总理郭沫若在世界和平理事会会议上，曾以四亿七千五百万的中国男女人民的名义，向德国人民及其作为马克思、恩格斯、歌德、康德和黑格尔的祖国的国家致敬。在另一方面，中国的高度文化也受到德国人民无比的尊敬。今年五月十五日，中国艺术展览会在柏林开幕时，总统皮克曾亲临参加，副总理乌布利希并把它当作在政治、艺术及科学上具有重要意义的事件之一。他认为这个展览会是中德人民间紧密团结的一个证明，通过这种团结，德国人民在为和平与统一的斗争中得到了鼓励。
    德国人民，尤其是德国文化工作者希望从文化交流的继续发展中，使他们为保存和发扬光大自己民族创造的文化遗产的斗争，得到格外有价值的果实。
    中德人民和世界上的其他人民一样，是爱好和平的。同时，他们十分了解，爱好和平必须和不屈不挠的坚决意志相结合，才能够积极地保卫和平。他们知道，只有人民实现斯大林的话：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底”，和平才能够保持和巩固。中德人民在政治、经济和文化的领域上的积极合作，就是反对美帝国主义的斗争中的一个锐利的武器。我们两国友谊的巩固，就是对于保卫和平的贡献，也就是对于继续加强不可战胜的世界和平阵线的贡献。
    中德人民的友谊万岁！英勇的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！（黄贤俊译）
