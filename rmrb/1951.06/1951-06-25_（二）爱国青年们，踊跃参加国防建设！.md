　　(II) Patriotic Youth, Eagerly Participate in National Defense Construction!
　　The announcement by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government of the "Decision on Enrolling Students in Various Military Cadre Schools" is an important measure to further promote national defense construction and will surely be enthusiastically responded to by young students from universities, specialized colleges, vocational schools, middle schools, secondary technical schools, junior normal schools, and graduates from senior primary schools and young people in society all over the country.
　　Last year, when the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission and the Government Administration Council recruited young students and young workers to participate in various military cadre schools, they quickly received enthusiastic responses from countless patriotic youths across the country who eagerly signed up, and many young students who signed up were not approved for admission. This fully demonstrates that the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of our country's youth have generally risen, far exceeding people's estimations. Now that various military cadre schools are recruiting again, this is an important opportunity for the vast number of revolutionary young students in our country. The moment they have long yearned for to dedicate themselves to the cause of national defense construction of the great motherland has arrived.
　　The cause of national defense construction in our glorious New China has been developing rapidly over the past year. Its achievements are brilliant, its tasks are glorious, and its future is bright. However, comparing our existing achievements in national defense construction with objective needs, our achievements are undoubtedly still very insufficient. The United States still occupies our Taiwan, still persists in its heinous war of aggression in Korea, actively rearming Japan and preparing for a new world war, all of which seriously threaten the security of our great motherland. We need to redouble our efforts to rapidly strengthen and consolidate our national defense forces.
　　The facts of the past year have fully demonstrated the significance of strengthening our national defense forces. Because our People's Liberation Army has a strong army and a considerable air force and navy, it has made the imperialist aggressors have to recognize our People's Republic of China as "a new strong country in Asia." Our heroic Chinese People's Volunteers' assistance to the Korean People's Army in the Korean battlefield has also caused serious defeats to the American invading army. If we further modernize our army with modern technology and highly regularized training, and further develop various technical arms, and further build a strong air force and navy, then, without a doubt, our national construction and people's security will be guaranteed, and we will make a greater contribution to world peace.
　　Of course, this does not mean that other construction undertakings besides national defense construction are not important. It is glorious to serve all kinds of construction undertakings needed by the people of the motherland. But today, smashing the imperialist conspiracy of aggression and defending the motherland is still our most important task. If we abandon or relax this task, then we will not be able to realize the tasks of economic, cultural, and other constructions with guarantee, and even the victories already won by our people will not be maintained and consolidated, and the democratic and free rights of our younger generation will also lose their guarantee.
　　After more than half a year of the vigorous patriotic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, we believe that the vast number of patriotic youth, especially young students, will more enthusiastically request to sign up to participate in military cadre schools. This time's registration, of course, is the same as last year's registration, and is completely voluntary; it, like all other voluntary revolutionary work, must be based on a high degree of political consciousness. Because the political consciousness of young people is increasing day by day, and this time the recruitment work has more perfect organization and practical methods, we believe that the recruitment committees in various places will be able to better unify the requirements of the vast number of patriotic young students with the needs of our national defense construction, so that our country's outstanding young sons and daughters, with unparalleled heroic spirit, will embark on the glorious post of the cause of national defense construction of the great motherland.

### （二）爱国青年们，踊跃参加国防建设！

　　（二）爱国青年们，踊跃参加国防建设！
    中央人民政府政务院“关于各种军事干部学校招收学生的决定”的公布，是进一步推进国防建设的重要措施，必将得到全国各地的大学、专门学院、专科学校、中学、中等技术学校、初级师范学校的青年学生及高小毕业生和社会青年的热烈响应。
    去年中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会和政务院，招收青年学生和青年工人，参加各种军事干部学校的时候，曾迅速得到了全国各地无数爱国青年的热烈响应，踊跃报名，并且有很多青年学生虽然报了名却没有被批准入学。这充分证明了我国青年政治觉悟和爱国热情的普遍高涨，远超过了人们的估计之上。现在各种军事干部学校再次招生了，这对于我国广大的革命青年学生，是一个重要的机会。他们所久已渴望的献身于伟大祖国的国防建设事业的时刻来到了。
    我们光辉的新中国的国防建设事业，一年来正在迅速发展着，它的成绩是辉煌的，它的任务是光荣的，它的前途是远大的。但是，把我们国防建设所已有的成绩和客观的需要相比，那末，我们的成绩无疑地还是非常不够的。美国至今还霸占着我国的台湾，至今还在朝鲜坚持着凶恶的侵略战争，积极地重新武装日本和准备新的世界战争，这一切都严重地威胁着我们的伟大祖国的安全。我们需要加倍努力，迅速加强与巩固我们的国防力量。
    一年来的事实已经完全证明了加强我国国防力量的意义。由于我国人民解放军拥有强大的陆军和相当的空军和海军，已经使帝国主义侵略者不能不承认我们中华人民共和国是“亚洲的一个新的强国”。我们英勇的人民志愿军在朝鲜战场的协助朝鲜人民军作战，又使美国侵略军遭受严重的失败。如果我们进一步使我们的陆军充分获得现代化的技术装备和高度正规化的训练，并且进一步发展各个技术兵种，进一步建设强大的空军和海军，那末，毫无疑问的，我们的国家建设和人民安全，就会有巩固的保障，对于世界和平也会有更伟大的贡献。
    当然，这并不是说，除国防建设以外的其他建设事业，就不是重要的了。只要为祖国人民所需要的各种建设事业而服务，都是光荣的。但在今天粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋、保卫祖国，仍然还是我们头等重要的任务，如果我们放弃或放松了这个任务，那末，我们就不能有保障地实现经济、文化等其他建设的任务，甚至连我们人民已得的胜利，都将不能保持与巩固，我们青年一代的民主自由权利也将失掉保证。
    经过了最近半年多轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝的爱国运动的教育之后，我们相信，广大的爱国青年，特别是青年学生，将更加踊跃地要求报名参加军事干部学校。这一次的报名当然和去年报名时一样，是要完全出于自愿的；它也和其他一切自愿参加的革命工作一样，都要以高度的政治自觉为基础。由于青年的政治自觉程度，正在日益提高，而这一次的招生工作又有了更加完善的组织和切合实际的办法，我们相信，各地招生委员会，一定能够更好地使广大爱国青年学生的要求，与我国国防建设的需要统一起来，让我国优秀的青年儿女，以无比的英雄气概，走上伟大祖国国防建设事业的光荣岗位。
