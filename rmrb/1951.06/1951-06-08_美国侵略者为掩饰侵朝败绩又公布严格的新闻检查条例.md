Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: In order to cover up the defeats in the Korean War, the American aggressor army has had to strengthen news control in order to conceal the failure of its so-called "offensive." According to a dispatch from the US Eighth Army Headquarters by the Associated Press on June 2nd, the Eighth Army's press security department recently issued a new censorship regulation that is the strictest since censorship was implemented last December. This regulation stipulates that "no mention shall be made of forward outposts, outposts lines, or the establishment of defensive positions or lines," and "no small cities occupied by United Nations forces shall be specified." According to Van Fleet, commander of the Eighth Army, the "new strict censorship regulations" are needed because "the war has entered a new stage." Obviously, the American aggressors are trembling with fear of being dealt even greater blows by the Korean and Chinese People's forces, and they have completely lost confidence in whether they can hold onto a defensive line or a small city.

　　美国侵略者为掩饰侵朝败绩又公布严格的新闻检查条例
    【新华社六日讯】美国侵略军为了掩饰侵朝战争的败绩，不得不加强新闻管制，以便掩饰其所谓“攻势”的失败。据美联社第八军总部本月二日电称，美军第八军新闻保密处最近发表了一个从去年十二月实行新闻检查以来限制最严的新闻检查条例。这个条例规定：“不得指出前哨基地、前哨线或关于防御阵地或防线的建立”，“不得指明被联合国部队占领的小的城市”。据第八军军长范佛里特说，“新的严格的检查条例”是由于“战争进入新的阶段”的需要。显然，美国侵略者正心惊胆战地惟恐受到朝、中人民部队的更大的打击，他们对于自己是否守得住一条防线或一个小城市，已经完全丧失了信心。
