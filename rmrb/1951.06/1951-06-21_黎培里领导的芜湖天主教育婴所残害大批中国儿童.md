　　The Wuhu Catholic Notre Dame Infant Home's cruel killing of large numbers of Chinese children has aroused the indignation of people from all walks of life in the local area. The Wuhu City Branch of the China People's Relief Association, accepting the demands of people from all walks of life and Catholics, sent personnel to the home on the 15th to investigate. A large number of infant corpses and skulls, estimated to be more than 100, were excavated in the alley of the home.

　　The home was established in December 1940, and the persons in charge were Sha Cixin and Du Lece (both Spanish), under the leadership of the imperialist element Li Peili. Since its establishment, the home has adopted a large number of Chinese children. According to Yu Daozong, a Catholic who used to be a teacher at Notre Dame, he personally copied a list of more than 100 baptized infants for the home in 1942. According to the "National Catholic Affairs Statistics of China" published internally by the Catholic Church in 1949, there were still 200 infants in the infant home in 1949. However, there are currently only 27 surviving children in the home (five infants, six older children, and the remaining sixteen fostered in private homes). The eleven children in the infant home are all skin and bones.

　　According to Catholics within Notre Dame, Sha Cixin, Du Lece, and others treated Chinese children very harshly. Catholic Li Chengxi said: Sha Cixin and others always placed the infants in a dark and humid basement. In summer, flies often covered the infants' eyes, nostrils, and lips. The infants' diapers were rarely changed, and over time, the infants' buttocks would rot and stink, and their bodies would be covered with scabies. The infant home's nannies, Fan Yueying and Wu Shaoying, accused Sha Cixin, Du Lece, and others of not caring about the infants' health at all and giving the children very bad food. Milk bottles and nipples were not disinfected, resulting in inflammation of the mouths of many infants. When children became ill, Sha Cixin, Du Lece, and others did not care at all, so many children died. Sha Cixin and others usually stripped the clothes off dead infants, wrapped them in a few scraps of waste paper, and dragged them out to bury them. In November 1947, a dead infant was not buried properly and was dragged to the windowsill by a dog and bitten beyond recognition. Sha Cixin, Du Lece, and others said, "We only save souls, not bodies."

　　The news that the Wuhu Branch of the China People's Relief Association had unearthed a large number of infant corpses in the infant home aroused even greater anger among the people of the city. On the 16th, more than 70 representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and churches held an accusation meeting. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish Li Peili, Sha Cixin, Du Lece, and other murderers who killed Chinese children.

　　黎培里领导的芜湖天主教育婴所残害大批中国儿童
    芜湖市天主教圣母院育婴所残害大批中国儿童，引起当地各界人民的激愤。中国人民救济总会芜湖市分会接受各界人民和天主教徒的要求，于十五日派员赴该所调查，在该所夹巷内挖掘出大批婴儿尸骨和脑壳，约计有一百多具。
    该所成立于一九四零年十二月，负责人是沙慈心、杜勒撤（都是西班牙籍），受帝国主义分子黎培里的领导。该所自成立以来，曾收养了大批中国儿童，据曾在圣母院做过教员的天主教徒余道宗说：他在一九四二年曾亲自代该所抄过一百多名领洗的婴儿名单。另据一九四九年天主教内部出版的《中华全国教务统计》内载，在一九四九年时，该育婴所中尚有婴孩二百名。但目前该所幸存的孩子只有二十七个（婴儿五个，较大的孩子六个，其余十六个寄养在民家）。在育婴所内的十一个孩子，都是骨瘦如柴。
    据圣母院内的天主教徒揭露，沙慈心、杜勒撤等对待中国儿童十分刻薄。教徒李成西说：沙慈心等一直将婴儿放在一个阴暗而又潮湿的地下室内，夏天，苍蝇经常叮满在婴儿的眼睛、鼻孔和嘴唇上。婴儿的尿片很少换洗，时间长了，婴儿的屁股便腐烂发臭，身上也生满疥疮。育婴所保姆范月英和吴少英控诉沙慈心、杜勒撤等毫不关心婴儿的健康，给孩子吃的很坏。乳瓶乳嘴都不消毒，以致很多婴儿口腔发炎。孩子有了病，沙慈心、杜勒撤等也毫不关心，因此孩子死的很多。沙慈心等通常把死婴的衣服剥光后，用几张废纸包起来，拖出去埋掉。一九四七年十一月，一个死婴没有掩埋好，被狗拖到窗台上，咬得不成样子。沙慈心、杜勒撤等却说：“我们只救灵魂，不救肉身。”
    中国人民救济总会芜湖分会在该育婴所内掘出大批婴儿尸骨的消息传出以后，更激起了全市人民的愤怒。十六日，该市各民主党派地方组织、人民团体和教会代表共七十多人举行控诉会，他们一致要求人民政府严厉惩办黎培里、沙慈心、杜勒撤等杀害中国儿童的凶手。
