　　National Cultural Work Troupe Conference Opens in Beijing

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 16th] The National Cultural Work Troupe Conference convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on the 16th.

　　More than 200 people attended the meeting, including representatives from cultural work troupes at all levels across the country and from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the trade union system, and the Communist Youth League system, as well as leading cadres of cultural and art administration at all levels and literary and art experts.

　　This conference will mainly discuss the future work guidelines, tasks, and division of labor of cultural work troupes across the country, as well as strengthening drama, music, and dance creation, and the professional study and improvement of members of the cultural work troupes.

　　At the meeting on the 16th, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing first delivered an opening speech. He pointed out: Cultural work troupes are one of the main forces in our revolutionary propaganda work. Some cultural work troupes have a history of twenty years. Whether it was in the various periods of the Chinese people's revolution, or now in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the work of the cultural work troupes has played a great role. Especially in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, cultural work troupes in various regions launched vigorous literary and artistic propaganda, and the works produced in various regions were in the thousands. Through these works, the patriotic ideology of the people across the country has been greatly improved. This conference is to consolidate these achievements and discuss some methods to launch various literary and artistic creations on a large scale so that the work of the cultural work troupes can better serve the great motherland and the people.

　　Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, gave a political and current affairs report to the conference. After reporting on the great achievements of the motherland's construction in the past year and the great victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, he pointed out that the current literary and artistic work is still about popularization first and continuous improvement on the basis of popularization; literary and artistic work must strictly obey politics. He called on members of cultural work troupes across the country to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to learn from the masses, to learn from life, and to strengthen planning in their work.

　　On the afternoon of the 16th, Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, who had rushed back to Beijing from Tianjin, specially reported to the conference on the propaganda work in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. He specifically told many heroic stories of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean military and civilians defeating the American bandits, and their noble qualities of optimism in the face of difficulties. He requested cultural workers across the country to create various artistic works based on these themes and to conduct propaganda to the people across the country. He also reported that during this trip to Korea for consolation work, the performances of the literary and art workers gave the greatest encouragement to the heroes on the front lines. He called on literary and art workers to once again organize a larger-scale team to go to Korea to carry out consolation work. Chairman Liao Chengzhi's report was warmly welcomed by all the representatives present.

　　The meeting is scheduled to last ten days and is expected to end around the 25th.

    十六日的会议，首先由文化部部长沈雁冰致开幕词。他指出：文工团是我们革命宣传工作中的主要力量之一。有的文工团已有二十年的历史。无论是在中国人民革命的各个时期中，以及现在抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命运动中，文工团工作都起了很大的作用。尤其在抗美援朝运动中，各地文工团展开蓬蓬勃勃的文艺宣传，各地产生的作品都是数以千计。通过这些作品已经使全国人民的爱国主义思想大大提高了一步。这次会议就是要把这些成绩巩固下来，并讨论一些办法，大量地展开各种文艺创作，使文工团工作能够更好地为伟大祖国和人民服务。
    政务院副总理兼文化教育委员会主任郭沫若向大会作了政治时事报告。他在报告了祖国建设一年来伟大的成就和抗美援朝的伟大胜利后，指出目前的文艺工作仍然是普及第一和在普及的基础上不断地提高；文艺工作必须严格地服从于政治。他号召全国文工团团员学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，向群众学习，向生活学习，并加强工作中的计划性。
    十六日下午，从天津赶回北京的中国人民赴朝慰问团团长廖承志特别向大会报告了抗美援朝中的宣传工作。他具体地讲述了许多中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民打败美国强盗的英雄故事，和他们不怕艰难的乐观主义的崇高品质。他要求全国各地文工团工作者根据这些题材，创作各种各样的艺术作品，向全国人民进行宣传。他又报告了这次赴朝慰问工作中，文艺工作者的表演给了前线英雄们以最大的鼓舞。他号召文艺工作者再一次组织更大规模的队伍，到朝鲜去进行慰问。廖承志团长的报告受到全体到会代表的热烈欢迎。
