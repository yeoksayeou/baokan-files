　　Our Embassy in North Korea Personnel
    Donate Money to Purchase Airplanes and Cannons
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st] All staff members of our embassy in North Korea enthusiastically responded to the call of the China People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea to promote patriotic pacts and donate airplanes and cannons. After studying and discussing the General Association's call documents and related editorials in the People's Daily for several days in each study group, everyone unanimously decided to formulate practical patriotic pacts and improve their work. At the same time, everyone enthusiastically participated in the movement to donate airplanes and cannons to consolidate national defense and strengthen support for the Chinese People's Volunteers. As of the 19th, all staff members had donated RMB 35 million. Zhou Chaohai, a 52-year-old cook, donated one million yuan. He said excitedly: My wife and children were killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops armed by the American invading bandits during the Chinese People's Liberation War. Now the American bandits are directly arming and invading Korea and occupying our country's Taiwan Province. Although I cannot go to the front line to kill the enemy, I will do my best to support the Korean and Chinese people's forces to eliminate the American bandits and avenge my wife and children.
