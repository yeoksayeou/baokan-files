　　National Conference on Secondary Technical Education Opens
    [From Our Newspaper] The first National Conference on Secondary Technical Education, convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, officially opened in Beijing on the morning of the 12th of this month.
    The representatives attending this conference included representatives from the education (cultural and educational) departments of major administrative regions and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, representatives from the education (cultural and educational) departments/bureaus of five provinces and two cities in North China, principals or deans of some secondary technical schools, and representatives from relevant departments and organizations of the central government and major administrative regions, such as industry, agriculture, finance and economics, and health, totaling 133 people.
    The opening ceremony was held on the morning of the 12th, with Minister Ma Xulun of the Ministry delivering the opening address, and Vice Minister Zeng Zhaolun giving a report on "Actively Consolidating and Developing Secondary Technical Education." Minister Ma pointed out that this conference is a conference of great importance to the development of our new China's construction cause. The construction of our country, in addition to requiring high-level technical talents, urgently needs a large number of intermediate technical personnel. He then explained the purpose of this conference: First, we must clearly define the direction and tasks of secondary technical education. Secondly, clear provisions should be made for the leadership relationship and funding issues of secondary technical education. Issues such as curriculum principles, subjects of general courses, and teaching plans, as well as strengthening the leadership of private tutorial schools, need to be discussed and clearly defined at this meeting. At the same time, he hoped that everyone would exchange opinions on the issue of teachers.
    In his report, Vice Minister Zeng explained the current situation and existing problems of secondary technical education, pointing out that the task of secondary technical schools should be to cultivate junior and intermediate technical talents who have general cultural and scientific basic knowledge, master modern production technology, and wholeheartedly serve the motherland and the people, using methods that integrate theory and practice. Because the country urgently and massively needs junior and intermediate technical personnel, we should adopt a policy of actively consolidating and developing secondary technical education. We should develop various types and levels of secondary technical schools in a diverse manner. The existing secondary technical schools from before liberation must be consolidated. Private secondary technical schools must be actively supported, consolidated, and transformed. Technical schools newly established after liberation must also be improved. He further pointed out that our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. We must attach importance to cultivating our own junior and intermediate technical cadres from the working class. Finally, he put forward opinions on several specific issues such as leadership relations, funding, curriculum materials, the 1951 establishment plan, and strengthening the leadership of technical private tutorial schools.
    From the afternoon, the conference began group discussions by region on Minister Ma's opening speech and Vice Minister Zeng's report. From the 13th, group discussions of various draft documents will be held. It is scheduled that the plenary meeting will discuss on the morning of the 19th, and a summary report will be made in the afternoon, and the closing ceremony will be held.
