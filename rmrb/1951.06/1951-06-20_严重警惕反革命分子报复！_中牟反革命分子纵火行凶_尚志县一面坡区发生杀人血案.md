    Seriously Beware of Counter-Revolutionary Elements' Revenge!
    Counter-Revolutionary Elements Commit Arson in Zhongmu
    Murderous Bloodbath Occurs in Yimianpo District, Shangzhi County
    [This Newspaper's Report] Three incidents of arson and assassination plots by counter-revolutionary elements occurred successively in Zhongmu County, Henan Province, in April. The vicious retaliatory acts of counter-revolutionary elements should arouse high vigilance among governments and the broad masses of people in various regions. On the evening of April 3, Li Wende, a liberated peasant and peasant representative of Maxiangli Village in the Third District, was locked in his house by counter-revolutionary elements after returning home from a meeting, and a fire was set outside. The wind was strong, and the fire was fierce, and in an instant, the house and furniture were reduced to ashes. Li Wende's wife and two children were burned to death on the spot. Li Wende was seriously injured and crawled out of the fire. He was sent to the hospital for emergency treatment by personnel from the township government, but he eventually died of his injuries. After Zhang Liansan, a local tyrant landlord in Dongdian Village in the First District, was executed by firing squad, his wife held a grudge and set fire on April 12, burning down 32 rooms of peasants' houses, more than 30 dan of grain, and more than 100 important farm tools. Four peasants were burned. Zhu Huizhang, a landlord tyrant in the Fourth District, had consistently oppressed the masses, killed and harmed people, and raped women. During the land reform last year, he was once classified as a rich peasant due to someone's protection. Li Fuquan, the militia platoon leader, and others, according to policy, argued reasonably and eventually changed Zhu's classification to landlord. The reactionary landlord Zhu Huizhang held a grudge against this and constantly plotted revenge. After the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries began, Zhu fled in fear of punishment; before leaving, he spent 500,000 yuan to buy off Zhu Xiaoxi, a rogue who had infiltrated the militia, and gave Zhu Xiaoxi a pistol, instructing him to act as opportunity arose and assassinate Li Fuquan. Zhu Xiaoxi spent 100,000 yuan to persuade Wei Shutang, Zhu Huizhang's former tenant, to plot to commit the crime together. On the evening of April 23, Li Fuquan returned home from the peasant association. Zhu and Wei followed him and entered the courtyard, raising their guns to assassinate him, but the plot failed because the bullets did not fire. Li Fuquan saw someone committing a crime and shouted loudly. After the neighbors arrived, they captured the two criminals on the spot and sent them to the county for punishment.

    The above-mentioned cases of retaliation by remnants of counter-revolutionary elements show that counter-revolutionary elements are unrepentant until death. The people in various regions should heighten their vigilance.

    [This Newspaper's Report] According to Xinhua News Agency: A bloodbath of counter-revolutionary fugitives killing people has recently occurred in Yimianpo District, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, due to a lack of vigilance against counter-revolutionary elements.

    The counter-revolutionary bandit Zhang Liye (also known as Zhang Leting), who fled to Yimianpo District, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, was from Beimazhuang, Wendeng District, Yidu County, Shandong Province. During 1946 and 1947, Zhang colluded with the Kuomintang bandit army in Shandong to kill Zhang Chunyun, a member of the peasant association, carried out cruel reckoning against the peasants, and pursued revolutionary cadres, with numerous blood debts. This spring, after the promulgation of the Regulations for the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries, Zhang and his accomplices, murderers Zheng Yusen, Jia Ziweng, and others, forged documents and fled to Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, in Northeast China, one after another, finding fellow villager He Futing. He Futing had not seen Zhang for more than 20 years and knew nothing about Zhang's situation, so he introduced Zhang and others to Le Lianyou's mill in Yimianpo District to work without any vigilance. Le Lianyou also did not investigate them and employed them. Neither of them reported to the local people's government. Thus, counter-revolutionary elements were given the opportunity to engage in conspiracy activities.

    On May 2, Le's child accidentally dug up a pistol and five bullets (buried by Zhang) at the foot of the wall and immediately handed them over to the district people's government. Although the cloth wrapping the gun was not rotten and the gun was not very rusty, the district chief did not become alert because of this, and the director of the local public security sub-bureau and the director of the police station blindly believed that it was a gun left over after "August 15" and did not pay attention to it.

    When Zhang saw that the buried gun had been discovered, he immediately conspired with his accomplice Jia Ziweng to escape, but He Futing, out of deep fellow villagers' affection, still kindly persuaded him to stay. Unexpectedly, the wolf-hearted and dog-lunged Zhang, feeling guilty, thought that He Futing and others already knew their background and became murderous. On the evening of the 5th, Zhang first injured He Futing and his wife with a sharp axe, then killed Le Lianyou, and then killed one more person, injuring ten other residents.

    After the tragedy occurred, it aroused great anger among the local people. The self-defense members of each street in the district immediately set up sentry posts, declared martial law, and dispatched overnight to assist the public security organs in pursuing the fugitives. Farmers in nearby villages and settlements also spread sentry posts on various roads and in various villages to carry out encirclement and suppression. Knowing that it was difficult to escape the people's inescapable net, Zhang committed suicide in fear of punishment on the edge of Naxiangtun near Yimianpo. Other accomplices, Zheng Yusen, Jia Ziweng, and others, were also captured one by one the day after the bloodshed.

　　严重警惕反革命分子报复！        
    中牟反革命分子纵火行凶
    尚志县一面坡区发生杀人血案
    【本报讯】河南省中牟县四月份曾连续发生反革命分子纵火及阴谋暗杀事件三起。反革命分子的毒辣报复行为，应引起各地政府及广大人民的高度警惕。四月三日晚，第三区马仙李村翻身农民，农民代表李文德，开会完毕回家休息后，房门被反革命分子锁住，并在屋外放起火来。风大火凶，顷刻之间，房屋、家具化为灰烬。李文德的妻子和两个孩子，当场被烧死。李文德身受重伤，从火中爬出，被乡政府人员送往医院急救，终因伤重，不治而死。第一区董店村恶霸地主张连三被枪决后，其妻怀恨在心，于四月十二日放火烧毁农民房屋三十二间，粮食三十余石，重要农具百余件。农民四人被烧伤。第四区恶霸地主朱惠章，一贯欺压群众，杀人害命，奸淫妇女。去年土地改革时，因有人包庇，曾一度被划为富农成份。民兵分队长李福全等，根据政策，据理力争，终将朱改为地主成份。反动地主朱惠章为此怀恨在心，时时阴谋进行报复。镇压反革命运动开始后，朱畏罪潜逃；临行前，曾以五十万元收买了混入民兵中的流氓朱小喜，并交给朱小喜抉枪一支，嘱其见机行事，暗杀李福全。朱小喜以十万元买动朱惠章的旧佃户魏书堂，图谋合伙行凶。四月二十三日晚，李福全从农会回家，朱、魏二人尾随而往，进入院中，举枪谋杀，但因子弹未响，阴谋未遂。李福全见有人行凶，大声呼喊，邻居赶到后，当场将二犯捕获，送县法办。
    以上几件反革命残余分子的报复案，说明反革命分子是至死不悟的，各地人民应该提高警惕。

    【本报讯】据新华社讯：松江省尚志县一面坡区最近因对反革命分子缺乏警惕发生了反革命逃犯杀人的血案。
    潜逃到松江省尚志县一面坡区的反革命匪徒张立业（又名张乐庭），是山东省益都县文登区北马庄人。张匪于一九四六至四七年间，曾在山东勾结国民党匪军杀害农会会员张春云，向农民进行残酷的倒算，并追捕革命干部，血债累累。今春三月间，惩治反革命条例颁布后，张匪和同伙杀人犯郑毓森、贾子温等，假造证件，先后逃来东北松江省尚志县，找到同乡贺福庭。贺福庭与张匪相别二十余年，对张匪情况毫不了解，当时竟未加警惕地即介绍张匪等至一面坡区乐连有的磨房中做工。乐连有对他们也未进行考察，即予留用。两人也都没有报告当地人民政府。于是给反革命分子造成了阴谋活动的机会。
    五月二日，乐家小孩无意中在墙脚下掘出手枪一支和子弹五颗（系张匪所埋），当即送交区人民政府。虽然包枪布未烂，枪身生锈不多，但该区区长却毫未因此引起警惕，该地公安分局局长和派出所所长亦盲目地认为是“八一五”后遗散的枪支而未加注意。
    张匪见埋藏枪支的事情被人发现了，当即与同伙贾匪子温密谋逃走，但贺福庭乡亲情重，仍一片好心劝他留住。不料狼心狗肺的张匪做贼心虚，以为贺福庭等已知道他们底细，即起了杀人的心。五日晚，张匪首先用利斧砍伤了贺福庭夫妇，接着砍死了乐连有，随后又砍死一人，砍伤其他居民十人。
    惨案发生后，激起了当地人民的极大愤怒，该区各街自卫队员立即布置岗哨，宣布戒严，并连夜出动，协助公安机关追捕逃犯。附近各村屯农民亦在各要道、各村落遍布岗哨，进行围捕。张匪自知难逃人民的天罗地网，即畏罪自杀于一面坡附近的南乡屯边。其他同谋犯郑毓森、贾子温等，也在血案发生后的第二天一一就擒。
