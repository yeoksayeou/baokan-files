　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. After receiving a letter from Chairman Li Dong-ying of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross Society on May 22nd, accusing the invading American army of atrocities, Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, sent a reply to support the just call of the Korean Red Cross Society.
    Chairman Li Dong-ying accused the American imperialists in his letter of disregarding the basic principles of human morality and international law, and of frantically destroying various facilities of the Korean Red Cross Society. American aircraft bombed and destroyed Red Cross hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical factories and the Central Pharmaceutical Bureau in cities such as Seoncheon, Wonsan, Dancheon and Pyongyang, all of which bore Red Cross markings. At the same time, they strafed Red Cross personnel and patients in the hospitals.
    President Li Dequan expressed her indignation at the atrocities of the American aggressors in her reply. The reply said: "On behalf of the Chinese Red Cross Society, I assure you that we are determined to fully support your just call and will unite with you, standing shoulder to shoulder bravely at the forefront of the struggle for world peace and against wars of aggression, in our medical relief work. Allow me to extend my respects and condolences to all members of your society on behalf of this association."

　　李德全复电声援朝鲜红十字会
    谴责美机疯狂轰炸破坏
    【新华社二日讯】中国红十字会总会李德全会长于五月二十二日接到朝鲜红十字会中央委员会李东英委员长控诉侵朝美军的暴行的来信之后，特复信支持朝鲜红十字会的正义呼声。
    李东英委员长在信中控诉美帝国主义无视人类道德与国际法的基本原则，疯狂地破坏朝鲜红十字会的各种设施。美国飞机轰炸和破坏了如宣川、元山、端川、平壤等城市的有红十字标志的红十字会医院、诊疗所、制药厂和中央药局等，同时并扫射红十字会的工作人员和医院里的病员。
    李德全会长复信对美国侵略者的暴行表示愤恨。复信说：“我代表中国红十字会向你保证，我们决定以全力支持你的正义呼声，并和你会团结一致，在医疗救济工作岗位上，英勇地并肩走向争取世界和平反对侵略战争的最前线。让我代表本会向你会全体会员致敬和慰问。”
