Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 21st: A special correspondent for this agency reports: After concluding their powerful spring counter-offensive on May 21st, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, conducting highly mobile warfare, proactively shifted to favorable areas north of the 38th parallel to launch a resolute blocking action, continuing to annihilate enemy manpower. From May 22nd to June 10th, the enemy army suffered losses amounting to over 36,000 personnel.

Since shifting north of the 38th parallel on May 22nd, the Korean and Chinese People's forces have engaged in a firm blocking action along the line of Linjie, Yangkou, Huachuan, and Lianchuan, forcing the enemy to pay a heavy price for every hill they attempted to capture. For example, when the American invading army and the Canadian accomplice army attempted to seize the Zhongjun Peak, Jiaoqi Peak, Mingcheng Peak, and Puda Peak line of positions north of Baochuan, the Korean and Chinese People's forces fiercely struck the enemy for six days and nights, killing and wounding over 2,500 enemy troops, before proactively withdrawing on the evening of the 4th of this month. On the 4th of this month, the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army launched a continuous joint land-air assault northward along both sides of the Lianchuan to Tieyuan highway. After three days of intense fighting on the 6th, 7th, and 8th, over 1,100 enemy troops were killed or wounded. In addition, the enemy lost four aircraft and thirteen tanks. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy in various locations, the Korean and Chinese People's forces proactively withdrew from the cities of Tieyuan and Jinhua on the 10th of this month.

After withdrawing from Tieyuan and Jinhua, the Korean and Chinese People's forces continued to engage the enemy in advantageous areas near Tieyuan and Jinhua, and continued to conduct a resolute blocking action in areas northeast of Linjie, north of Yangkou, northeast of Huachuan, and northwest of Lianchuan, preventing the fiercely attacking enemy from succeeding. Instead, the Korean and Chinese People's forces repeatedly annihilated enemy manpower.

In this latest enemy advance northward, over 36,000 enemy troops were annihilated in just twenty days from May 22nd to June 10th, including over 22,000 American invading troops. During this period, the Korean and Chinese People's forces also shot down 80 enemy aircraft, damaged 18 enemy aircraft, destroyed 62 enemy tanks, and damaged 23 enemy tanks. In addition, they captured numerous guns, artillery, and other equipment. The enemy's severe losses could not be concealed even by Van Fleet. In a statement on the war situation issued on the 10th of this month, he lamented that this was "the bloodiest and longest battle of the war," saying that this campaign caused "significant losses" to the "United Nations forces."

　　中朝人民部队进行坚强阻击战
    二十天歼敌三万六千
    毁伤敌机九十八架及坦克八十五辆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十一日电】本社特派记者报道：进行高度机动作战的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，在五月二十一日结束了春季强大反击战以后，主动转移到北纬三十八度线以北有利地区，展开坚强阻击战，继续歼灭敌军有生力量。从五月二十二日到六月十日，敌军损失兵力已达三万六千余人。
    朝、中人民部队自五月二十二日转移至北纬三十八度线以北后，即在麟蹄、杨口、桦川、涟川一线展开坚强阻击战，使敌军攻占每一个山头，都要付出重大的代价。如美国侵略军和加拿大帮凶军企图攻占抱川以北的中军峰、角屹峰、鸣城峰、朴达峰一线阵地，朝中人民部队在这里痛击敌人六昼夜，杀伤敌军二千五百多人，至本月四日晚方主动撤离。本月四日，美国侵略军和李伪军又沿着涟川至铁原公路两侧向北连续发动了陆空联合的猛攻，经六、七、八三天的激战，敌军被杀伤一千一百名以上。此外，敌军还损失了四架飞机和十三辆坦克。朝中人民部队在各地给予敌军重大杀伤后，于本月十日主动撤离铁原、金化两城。
    朝中人民部队撤离铁原、金化后，即在铁原、金化附近的有利地区继续与敌军作战，并且在麟蹄东北、杨口以北、桦川东北、涟川西北等地区继续进行坚强的阻击战，使猛烈进攻的敌军无法得逞。而朝、中人民部队却一再歼灭敌军有生力量。
    这次敌军继续北犯，仅仅在五月二十二日到六月十日的二十天中就被歼灭了三万六千余人，其中美国侵略军的损失达二万二千余人。朝、中人民部队并在这时期中击落敌机八十架，击伤敌机十八架，击毁敌坦克六十二辆，击伤敌坦克二十三辆，此外并缴获各种枪、炮等多件。敌军的严重损失，连范佛里特也无法隐讳。他在本月十日发表的战局声明中，哀鸣这是“战争中最血腥的和时间拖得最长的一次战役”，说这次战役使“联合国军”“蒙受到重大的损失”。
