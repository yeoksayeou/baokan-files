Xinhua News Agency, June 25th: TASS, Paris, June 24th - "L'Humanité" published a statement by the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party on June 23rd. The statement is as follows:

Due to electoral fraud, an extremely reactionary majority has been formed in the National Assembly. This National Assembly certainly does not represent the opinion expressed by the peace-loving and freedom-loving French people on June 17th. This National Assembly is already preparing to intensify the policies of national betrayal, war, poverty, and reaction, which have been pursued since the Communists were excluded from the government. Our country, peace, the living conditions of the masses, and our freedom are under serious threat.

Negotiations are underway to form a pro-fascist government closely colluding with the French People's League. The task of this government is to pave the way for the French People's League. The leaders of the Socialist Party, who presided over the election fraud, bear the main responsibility for the reactionary composition of the new National Assembly. They intend to help establish such a government and serve as lackeys of fascism to the end.

American rulers, in order to accelerate war preparations and intensify anti-labor and anti-democratic repression, have already instructed their vassals in France—from Mollet to de Gaulle—on what to do. The American rulers and their vassals want to force the French people to accept policies they do not want.

In order to protect the interests of the country, the French Communist Party calls on all French men and women who do not want war and poverty to unite and fight together for a policy of peace that conforms to the interests of France and the people.

This policy should be based on the following points:

(1) The five major powers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France should conclude a peace treaty and welcome the participation of all countries.

(2) Cancel all agreements that infringe on national independence, and the American occupiers withdraw from French territory.

(3) Conclude a peace treaty with a united, democratic, peace-loving Germany that has been purged of militarism.

(4) Immediately restore peace in Vietnam, recall the expeditionary force, and withdraw the French troops sent to Korea.

(5) Promulgate laws to ban war propaganda, prohibit atomic weapons, and prohibit any other weapons that cause mass destruction.

(6) Gradually reduce troops and armaments under supervision, and use the money saved to develop the national economy, meet the social welfare needs of the people, and improve the living conditions of the working masses in urban and rural areas.

(7) Guarantee democratic freedoms and rights, making them invulnerable to any conspiracies by traitors.

The French Communist Party believes that saving France and ensuring peace are paramount. Therefore, it reiterates that the French Communist Party is willing to cooperate with and support any government that is determined to implement such a policy. The French Communist Party is convinced that this is in line with the wishes of millions of French men and women. The French people know what evil things the National Assembly elected by fraud will do if it is not stopped by the will of the people. The people have the power to influence the direction of the situation, even though the deceptive election law has produced a reactionary majority. As Thorez emphasized at the Party's Twelfth Congress, as long as the masses of the people take action, they can modify the policy. The actions of the masses can influence the parliament and the government.

The French Communist Party calls on all French men and women who are loyal to the independence, freedom, and peace of France to rise up against the policies that tightly bind them to war, poverty, and fascism, and to the policies pursued by the running dogs of imperialism.

The French Communist Party calls on the people to spare no effort to create the conditions for the establishment of a truly French government, a government of social progress, freedom, and peace.

　　法共政治局就议会选举结果发表声明
    号召人民团结起来为争取实行和平政策而斗争
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：《人道报》六月二十三日发表法国共产党政治局的声明。声明如下：
    由于选举骗局，国民议会中已经形成一个极端反动的多数。这个国民议会当然不能代表爱好和平与自由的法国人民在六月十七日所表示出来的意见。这个国民议会已经在准备加紧进行卖国、战争、贫穷与反动的政策，这是自从共产党人被排除出政府之后就一直在奉行的政策。我们的国家、和平、群众的生活条件和我们的自由，已受到严重危险的威胁。
    成立一个和法兰西人民联盟密切勾结的亲法西斯政府的谈判，已经在进行了，这个政府的任务，就是为法兰西人民联盟开路。选举骗局的主持者社会党的首领们，应负组成新国民议会的反动成份的主要责任，他们打算帮助成立这样一个政府，并充当法西斯的奴才到底。
    美国统治者为了加速备战和加紧进行反劳工反民主的镇压，已经指示他们在法国的附庸——从摩勒到戴高乐之流——应该怎样做；美国统治者和他们的附庸都想强使法国人民接受他们所不愿要的政策。
    为了保护国家的利益，法国共产党号召全体不要战争和贫穷的法兰西男女团结起来，共同斗争，争取实行符合法国与人民的利益的和平政策。
    这个政策要以下面各点为基础：
    （一）美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国、法国五大国缔结和平公约，并欢迎一切国家参加。
    （二）取消一切侵害民族独立的协定，美国占领者撤出法国领土。
    （三）和肃清了军国主义的、统一、民主、爱好和平的德国缔结和约。
    （四）立即在越南恢复和平，召回远征军，撤退派往朝鲜的法军。
    （五）颁布法令取缔战争宣传，禁止原子武器，并禁止造成大规模毁灭的任何其他各种武器。
    （六）有监督地逐渐裁减军队与军备，把省下来的钱用来发展国家的经济，满足人民的社会福利需要，以及改善城乡劳动群众的生活条件。
    （七）保障民主自由权利，使之不受叛逆分子的任何阴谋侵犯。
    法国共产党认为拯救法国和保障和平高于一切。因此，它再次声明：任何政府如果决心实行这种政策，法国共产党都愿意和它合作，并且支持它。法国共产党确信：这是符合法国千百万男女的愿望的。法国人民知道：如果不用人民的意志加以制止，用骗局选出来的国民议会会作出怎样邪恶的事情来。人民有力量左右形势发展的方向，虽然欺骗的选举法产生了一个反动的多数。多列士在党第十二次代表大会上曾经着重指出：只要人民群众行动起来，就能够使政策修改。人民群众的行动可以影响议会和政府。
    法国共产党号召全体忠于法国的独立、自由与和平的法国男女起来反对把他们紧紧地束缚在战争、贫穷与法西斯主义的政策上，束缚在帝国主义的走狗所奉行的政策上。
    法国共产党号召人民不遗余力地创造条件，以便成立一个真正法国的政府，社会进步、自由与和平的政府。
        法国共产党政治局（签字）
