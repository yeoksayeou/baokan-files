Beijing Municipal News Agency report: The Third Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee held a joint meeting on the 13th, presided over by Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Municipal Consultative Committee. Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, also attended and provided guidance.

After the meeting began, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu first explained the draft budget for this year's municipal revenue and expenditure, which was unanimously approved by the attending members after review. Subsequently, Luo Ruiqing,兼 Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported on the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Jiao Huanwu, Zheng Yun, and Xu Chubo, members of the Municipal People's Government Committee, and Chen Mingde and Zhang Hongshun, members of the Municipal Consultative Committee, spoke successively, unanimously agreeing that Beijing's work in suppressing counter-revolutionaries had achieved great success: it had struck down the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries and educated the broad masses of the people. Committee Member Jiao Huanwu said: "I participated in land reform in northern Anhui and saw that the peasants were very enthusiastic about suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but they still had concerns about the possibility of escaped despotic landlords returning for revenge. Therefore, I suggest that the government closely monitor the activities of escaped landlords in the cities and strengthen household registration management." Committee Member Zheng Yun said: "We should respond to Mayor Peng's call to organize public security committees. We should also regularly combine the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries with various movements, and not relax our vigilance, lest counter-revolutionary elements exploit loopholes."

The meeting agreed to establish six specialized groups under the Municipal Consultative Committee: finance and economics, politics and law, culture and education, municipal construction, health, and social welfare. Representatives of the Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Representative Conference can each participate in one group. Each group will regularly study the opinions and proposals put forward by the people from all walks of life and study various specialized issues in the city.

Finally, the meeting decided to convene the Second Session of the Third Municipal People's Representative Conference on the 23rd of this month.

　　北京市协商委员会和政府委员会        
    昨日举行联席会议
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第三届各界人民代表会议协商委员会和市人民政府委员会，十三日举行联席会议，由市协商委员会主席彭真主持，中央人民政府李济深副主席亦出席指导。
    开会后，首先由张友渔副市长说明本市今年度岁入岁出预算草案，经到会委员审查后，一致通过。继由市公安局罗瑞卿兼局长报告镇压反革命工作的情况。市人民政府委员会委员焦寰五、郑芸、徐楚波、市协商委员会委员陈铭德、张鸿舜先后发言，一致认为北京市镇压反革命的工作有很大的成绩：打掉了反革命的气焰，教育了广大人民。焦寰五委员说：“我到皖北参加土地改革，看到农民对镇压反革命的热情很高，但是他们还有顾虑，怕逃亡的恶霸地主回来报复，因此建议政府严密监视逃亡地主在城市的活动，加强户口管理。”郑芸委员说：“我们应该响应彭市长的号召，组织治安保卫委员会，还应该经常的把镇压反革命的工作，和各种运动结合起来，不要放松警惕，叫反革命分子钻了空子。”
    会议同意在市协商委员会之下，成立财经、政法、文教、市政建设、卫生、社会福利等六个专门小组，协商委员会和市各界人民代表会议的代表可以各自参加一组。各组经常研究各界人民所提出的意见和提案，研究全市各种专门问题。
    最后，会议决定在本月二十三日召开第三届第二次各界人民代表会议。
