To the Editor:

　　Heilongjiang Zhaodong County Dayushu Village's Provincial Special-Class Labor Model Dong Dianfu Mutual Aid Team has successfully completed its spring production plan this year. Based on the actual situation, everyone has further improved the original plan, such as increasing the weeding of various autumn crops by one time, and millet will be hoed seven times and weeded five times.

　　The original plan of the Dong Dianfu Mutual Aid Team was to apply fertilizer to 95% of the cultivated land. Now, not only has fertilizer been applied to 100% of the cultivated land, but nearly 30 *qing* of sorghum and corn fields have also been fertilized a second time. They also plan to apply a third topdressing to five *qing* of corn fields. The original plan to improve five *qing* of soil has also exceeded the original plan by three *qing*.

　　The Dong Dianfu Team's production enthusiasm is so high because of the serious patriotic education they have conducted. After denouncing the crimes of the Japanese invaders and learning about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the "May Day" parade, each member has received almost seven patriotic propaganda and education sessions. Team member Zhou Jicai once said, "Farmers only know how to farm, what is patriotism?" Dong Dianfu, hearing Zhou Jicai's words, told him about the relationship between farming and patriotism, telling him that if he did not love the country, he would live the old life and have no land to cultivate. At the mass meeting to denounce the crimes of the Japanese invaders, Zhou Jicai also denounced the situation of the landlord colluding with the Japanese devils to persecute him; and expressed his determination to work hard to increase production, increase the strength to resist the United States and aid Korea, and protect his good life.

　　The movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries also improved everyone's production enthusiasm. When the team members heard that the government had arrested counter-revolutionaries such as Wang Dabanzi and Feng Huanzhang, everyone clapped their hands and said, "The arrest is right, the government has avenged us, and our good days are more secure." After team members Zhang Yufu and Zhang Bobanzi's daughter-in-law and others denounced the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries, they immediately expressed their determination to overfulfill the production plan.

### 黑龙江肇东县董殿福互助组  经过爱国教育生产劲头提高

　　黑龙江肇东县董殿福互助组
    经过爱国教育生产劲头提高编辑同志：
    黑龙江肇东县大榆树屯省特等劳动模范董殿福互助小组，今年春季的生产计划已经胜利完成。大家并根据实际情况，将原计划提高一步，如对各种秋庄稼的铲?，普遍增加一遍，谷子要作到七铲五?。
    董殿福互助组原计划百分之九十五的耕地要上粪，现在不仅作到百分之百的耕地都上了粪，而且有近三十垧高粱、苞米地，又上了第二次粪。并准备在五垧苞米地里上第三次追肥。原计划改良土壤五垧，也超过原计划三垧。
    董殿福小组生产劲头这样足，这和他们认真进行爱国主义教育有很大的关系。该组组员，经过控诉日寇罪行，学习镇压反革命及“五一”大游行等活动，每个人差不多都受到了七次爱国宣传教育。组员周继财曾说：“庄稼人就知道种地，啥爱国不爱国呀？”董殿福听了周继财的话，就给他讲种地与爱国的关系，告诉他不爱国就要过旧日的生活，就没有地种。在控诉日寇罪行的群众会上，周继财也控诉了地主勾结日本鬼子迫害他的情形；并表示要努力生产，增加抗美援朝的力量，保住自己的好光景。
    镇压反革命运动也提高了大家的生产情绪。组员们听说政府把王大板子、冯焕章等反革命分子抓起来了，大家都拍手说：“抓的对，政府为我们报了仇，我们的好日子更保险了。”组员张玉富和张老板子的媳妇等控诉了反革命分子的罪恶之后，当时就表示决心要超额完成生产计划。
