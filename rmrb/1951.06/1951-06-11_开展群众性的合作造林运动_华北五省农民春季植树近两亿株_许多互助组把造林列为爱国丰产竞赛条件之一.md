Launch a Mass Cooperative Afforestation Movement
　　Farmers in Five North China Provinces Plant Nearly 200 Million Trees in Spring
　　Many Mutual Aid Teams List Afforestation as a Condition for Patriotic Production Increase Competition
    The spring afforestation work of farmers in five North China provinces has been completed before the Beginning of Summer (May 6). Farmers in the five provinces planted nearly 200 million trees, completing more than 50 percent of this year's tree planting plan for the five provinces.

    The development of a mass cooperative afforestation movement is a feature of this year's afforestation work in the five North China provinces. Various forms of cooperative afforestation organizations have been widely established in various afforestation areas this year. For example, the Yongding River basin in Hebei Province is one of the key areas for afforestation work in the country this year. This spring, farmers in the area cooperated with local forestry agencies to plant 7,295 mu of protection forests and water source forests. Farmers in nine villages, including Mazhuang in Ying County, Chahar Province, organized afforestation cooperatives and divided into 232 groups to cooperate in afforestation. In seven days, they planted more than 380 mu of windbreak forest belts and 44 windbreak forest nets. Seventeen agricultural production mutual aid teams in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, also cooperated in afforestation on 300 mu of land this spring. This spring, there was a general lack of rain in various parts of North China. During the drought resistance period, farmers in various places still did not relax their afforestation work. For example, inspired by patriotic enthusiasm for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, farmers in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, automatically carried water and cooperated to build "Resist-America Forests" and "Patriotic Forests." Many agricultural production mutual aid teams have also included tree planting and afforestation as one of the competition conditions in the patriotic production increase competition movement.

    When farmers carried out afforestation, the people's governments in various places universally paid attention to assisting farmers in improving cultivation techniques, or organizing farmers to observe and discuss so that they could exchange experience and ensure the survival of seedlings. For example, Yupin, Shipan, Niujiazui and other villages in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, held symposiums of tree planting experts this spring, where tree planting experts introduced their tree planting experience to the masses. In Tongchangdian and other nine villages in Xinle County, Hebei Province, a tree planting visiting group led by labor models visited Huangjiazhuang, Dongming Village and other tree planting model villages to learn on the spot, absorb the cooperative afforestation methods and techniques of the tree planting model villages, and greatly improved the afforestation enthusiasm of the farmers in their villages. In addition, local governments directly dispatched forestry technical cadres to various places to specifically guide farmers in afforestation, which is also an important method to promote the farmers' afforestation movement. For example, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central Government and the People's Government of Hebei Province dispatched a total of 66 forestry technicians to the sandy afforestation areas in western Hebei Province this spring to provide specific guidance, which greatly helped the local farmers.

    In addition, in order to protect the growth of forests, farmers in various places have generally formed forest protection organizations and formulated forest protection covenants. A system of regular inspections has also been established. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　开展群众性的合作造林运动
　  华北五省农民春季植树近两亿株
    许多互助组把造林列为爱国丰产竞赛条件之一
    华北五省农民的春季造林工作，已在立夏（五月六日）以前全部结束。五省农民共植树近两亿株，已完成五省今年植树计划的百分之五十以上。
    开展群众性的合作造林运动，是华北五省今年造林工作的特点。各个造林地带今年都普遍建立了各种形式的合作造林组织，如河北省的永定河流域，是今年全国造林工作的重点地区之一，今春该地农民即与当地林业机关合作植造了七千二百九十五亩地的防护林和水源林。察哈尔省应县的马庄等九个村农民组织了造林合作社，分成二百三十二个小组合作造林，在七天内就栽植了三百八十多亩地的防风林带和四十四处防风林网。山西省榆社县的十七个农业生产互助组今春也合作造林达三百亩地。华北各地今春普遍缺雨，各地农民在抗旱期间，仍然没有放松造林工作。如河北省武清县的农民在抗美授朝的爱国热情鼓舞下，自动担水，合作造了“抗美林”和“爱国林”。许多农业生产互助组在爱国丰产竞赛运动中，把植树造林也列为竞赛条件之一。
    在农民进行造林时，各地人民政府普遍地注意了协助农民提高栽培技术，或组织农民观摩座谈，以便互相交流经验，保证树苗的成活。如山西省武乡县的玉品、石盘、牛家咀等村今春都召开了植树能手座谈会，由植树能手向群众介绍他们的植树经验。河北省新乐县的同常店等九个村由劳动模范带头组成的造林参观团，到造林模范村的黄家庄、东名村等地实地参观学习，吸取了造林模范村的合作造林办法和技术，大大提高了本村农民的造林情绪。此外，各地政府并直接派出林业技术干部到各地具体指导农民造林，也是推动农民造林运动的重要办法之一。如中央林垦部和河北省人民政府今春共派出林业技术人员六十六人到河北省西部的沙荒造林地区具体指导，对当地农民帮助很大。
    此外，各地农民为了保护林木的成长，均普遍组成了护林组织，订立了护林公约。并规定了定期检查的制度。（新华社）
