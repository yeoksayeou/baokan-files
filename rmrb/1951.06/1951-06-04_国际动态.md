            A Happy Childhood
    The Artek children's summer sanatorium in the Soviet Union, located in the scenic area of the southern Crimean coast, will accommodate more than five thousand children this year. The medical department of the sanatorium area has been equipped with the latest equipment, and the buildings and parks have been repaired. Children can enjoy pleasant activities such as traveling, sea bathing, sunbathing, bonfires, and sports meets on the green grass of the cliffs and shores.
            Children's Fears
    War hysteria in the United States makes children live in fear. Elementary school students are disturbed by military training and air defense drills. A group of educators in the Midwest of the United States recently conducted a survey of young people in the area, asking the question: "What do you expect to happen in the next ten years?" As a result, 60 percent of the children questioned simply answered: "Death." This shows the extent to which American children are terrified by insane war propaganda.
            The Dollar Doesn't Work
    The United States Information Service and the British Information Service, located in various Arab countries, requested local writers and journalists to write anti-Soviet articles, and declared their willingness to pay huge fees. However, journalists and writers from various Arab countries rejected this request. They told the Americans and the British that their talents and conscience were not for sale.

            幸福的童年
    苏联儿童暑假休养中心地阿泰克，位于克里米亚南部海滨的风光绮丽的地区，今年将容纳五千多儿童。休养区的医疗部已经配置了最新式的设备，大厦与公园都已修理完竣。儿童们可以在绿草如茵的山崖水畔作着旅行、海水浴、日光浴、营火会、运动会等各种愉快的活动。
            儿童的恐惧
    美国的战争歇斯底里使儿童生活于恐惧之中。小学生被军事训练和防空演习弄得心神不安。美国中西部一群教育家最近在该区少年儿童中进行调查，提出一个问题：“你预料今后十年中会有些什么事情？”结果被询问的儿童中有百分之六十都只简单地回答：“死亡”。这可以看出美国的儿童被疯狂战争宣传恐惧到什么程度。
            美元不灵
    设在各阿拉伯国家的美国新闻处和英国新闻处，要求当地的作家和新闻记者撰写反苏文章，并声明愿付巨额的稿费。然而各阿拉伯国家的新闻记者和作家们拒绝了这个要求。他们向美国人和英国人说，他们的才智和良心是不出卖的。
