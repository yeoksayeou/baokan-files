　　Truman Proposes "Mutual Security Program"
    Intensifies Fundraising for Wars of Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency] On May 24, U.S. President Truman submitted a so-called "Mutual Security Program" message to Congress, requesting an appropriation of $8.5 billion for the 1951-52 fiscal year to consolidate the armaments of the entire imperialist camp, including the rebuilding of West German militarist forces, to serve the U.S. imperialist aggression plan.

    Truman explained that this "Mutual Security Program" is to merge the United States' past so-called "aid" programs into a single program mainly supplying arms, including so-called "economic assistance" which will also be "mainly used to support rearmament." In this plan, Western European NATO countries (which will actually include West Germany, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Spain, and Greece) are designated as the main countries providing aggressive troops, the Middle East is designated as a strategic hub, and the so-called "backward countries" in Asia and Latin America are responsible for expanding the supply of strategic materials and providing cannon fodder.

    The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in Korea, and the Bao Dai puppet regime in Vietnam are all targets that Truman specifically mentioned for assistance.

    With an extremely arrogant attitude, Truman arbitrarily included many countries in the plan, prescribed tasks for them, and declared: "The need for aid will be continuously reviewed based on the performance of each country and changes in economic and political aspects."

    Truman's message fully exposed the U.S. imperialist intention to further enslave its vassal states to achieve its expansionist goals. When Truman ordered his Western European lackeys to accelerate military buildup, he admitted that these countries "have not yet escaped the impact of the most destructive war in history" and that their "economic situation is very tight." Truman also admitted that in order to implement the U.S. aggressive arms expansion plan, these countries would also have to "transfer a large amount of manpower and other economic resources originally used for the production of consumer goods, for investment, and for export to other areas (actually the war area)." Truman also admitted: "Rearmament will seriously consume the economies of Western European countries." However, despite this, Truman still brazenly declared that, "for the sake of U.S. security," they "must" build up their military. Therefore, the inevitable result of this plan is to further undermine the economies of capitalist countries, arouse greater dissatisfaction among the people of the eleven countries, and thus weaken the rule of the entire imperialism.

### 杜鲁门提出“共同安全计划”  加紧为侵略战争筹措资金

　　杜鲁门提出“共同安全计划”
    加紧为侵略战争筹措资金
    【新华社讯】美国总统杜鲁门于五月二十四日向国会提出了一项所谓《共同安全计划》咨文，要求于一九五一——五二会计年度拨款八十五亿美元，整顿整个帝国主义阵营各地的军备，包括重建西德军国主义势力在内，为美帝国主义的侵略计划服务。
    杜鲁门说明，这个“共同安全计划”是要把美国过去各种所谓“援”外计划合并成一个以供应军火为主的单一计划，其中包括的所谓“经济援助”也将“主要用以支持重整军备”。在这个计划中，西欧各北大西洋公约国家（实际上还将包括西德、土耳其、南斯拉夫、西班牙及希腊）被规定为提供侵略军队的主要国家，中东被划定为战略枢纽地区，所谓亚洲“落后国家”和拉丁美洲国家则担负扩大战略物资供应和提供炮灰的责任。
    台湾的蒋介石匪帮、朝鲜的李承晚匪帮以及越南的保大傀儡都是杜鲁门特别提到要给予援助的对象。
    杜鲁门以极端骄横的态度，擅自把许多国家统统列入计划，为他们规定了任务，并且宣告：“援助的需要将不断地根据各国的成绩如何以及经济方面和政治方面的变化予以审查。”
    杜鲁门的咨文完全暴露出美帝国主义进一步奴役其仆从国家以达到它扩张目的的意图。杜鲁门在号令其西欧仆从加速整军时承认：这些国家“仍然没有脱离历史上破坏力最大的战争的影响”，它们的“经济状况、甚为拮据”。杜鲁门又承认：为了执行美国的侵略扩军计划，这些国家还得“把原来用于消费品生产、用于投资、用于输出的人力以及其他经济资源大量转移到别的方面（实际上就是战争方面）去”。杜鲁门还承认：“重整军备将严重地消耗西欧各国的经济”。但是，尽管如此，杜鲁门仍然悍然宣布，“对美国的安全说来”，它们“必须”整军。所以，这种计划的必然的结果就是进一步破坏各资本主义国家的经济，引起十一国人民更大的不满，从而削弱整个帝国主义的统治。
