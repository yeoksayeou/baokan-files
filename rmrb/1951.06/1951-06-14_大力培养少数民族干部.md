To realize the ethnic policy of the Common Program, a major condition is the extensive use of minority ethnic cadres. Minority ethnic cadres need to be cultivated universally and extensively. To this end, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the Trial Plan for Cultivating Minority Ethnic Cadres last December and approved the Trial Plan for Preparing for the Establishment of the Central Institute for Nationalities, solving many important issues in the work of cultivating minority ethnic cadres. According to these two plans, the Central Institute for Nationalities, responsible for cultivating minority ethnic cadres and Han ethnic cadres engaged in ethnic work, has already opened, and the Northwest, Southwest, and Central South Institutes for Nationalities have also opened or are about to open. We would like to offer some opinions here on the issue of cultivating minority ethnic cadres.

The main task of the Institutes for Nationalities is to cultivate minority ethnic cadres. The central and local ethnic affairs commissions need to make great efforts for this work. People of any ethnicity love and support cadres from their own ethnicity. The people of various minority ethnicities in our country often say when discussing cadre issues: "The Han ethnic comrades are all very good, but they still don't know the things in our homes. How much salt and chili do we have? What should we eat today? What should we eat tomorrow? With the coalition government, we have people from all ethnic groups in it, and it will be easy to handle." They feel that only a regional autonomous government with cadres from their own ethnicity as the main body is their own government, otherwise, even if it is a "good government," it is still not "their own government." This kind of ethnic sentiment should be fully respected.

However, some Han ethnic workers still do not sufficiently recognize the importance of cultivating and promoting minority ethnic cadres. They often make excessive demands on minority ethnic cadres, lack appropriate care and assistance for them, only thinking they are "weak" and need to be "further tempered" and "further tested"; and for intellectuals among minority ethnicities, they often inappropriately emphasize their class background and ignore the work of uniting and transforming them; and for the customs and habits of minority ethnicities, they often consider them to be manifestations of their "backward" ideology. These incorrect attitudes, of course, seriously hinder the work of cultivating and promoting minority ethnic cadres.

The Central Institute for Nationalities also needs to be responsible for training a group of Han ethnic cadres who work with minority ethnicities. This force is also necessary for the development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of minority ethnicities and is welcomed by the people of various minority ethnicities. But there are also some minority ethnic people who do not quite understand the importance of Han ethnic cadres to the various minority ethnicities. They impatiently demand that the affairs of their own ethnicity be completely handed over to their own ethnicity to do immediately, which is also incorrect. It should be recognized that, under today's conditions, the work of restoring and constructing minority ethnic areas cannot be done without the help of Han ethnic cadres. Of course, Han ethnic cadres who work in minority ethnic areas must establish a loving and cooperative close relationship with the local ethnic groups, act in accordance with the will of the majority of the people of the local ethnic groups, and not act according to their own opinions. At the same time, they should also seriously learn from the people of the local ethnic groups, learn their languages, understand their customs and habits, appreciate their ethnic feelings, and strive to cultivate themselves into all the necessary conditions for a minority ethnic work cadre, so as to better serve the minority ethnic people. And training Han ethnic cadres according to these requirements is also one of the important tasks of the Institute for Nationalities.

The Central Institute for Nationalities has already opened, and the flowers of talent from various minority ethnicities, under the spring breeze of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, will bloom more and more vigorously every day. We congratulate the infinitely bright future of minority ethnic work.

### 大力培养少数民族干部

　　大力培养少数民族干部
    实现共同纲领的民族政策的一个主要条件，是大量地使用少数民族干部。少数民族干部需要普遍而大量地培养。为此，中央人民政府政务院于去年十二月颁发了培养少数民族干部试行方案，并批准了筹办中央民族学院试行方案，解决了培养少数民族干部这一项工作中的许多重要问题。根据这两个方案，负责培养少数民族干部以及担任民族工作的汉民族干部的中央民族学院已经开学，西北、西南、中南民族学院也已经或即将开学。我们愿意在这里对培养少数民族干部问题说一点意见。
    民族学院的主要任务是培养少数民族干部。对于这一项工作，中央和各地民族事务委员会都需要作极大的努力。任何民族的人民都是爱戴本民族的干部的。我国各少数民族的人民，常常在讨论干部问题的时候说：“汉族工作同志都很好，可是他们到底还不知道我们家里的事。我们有多少盐巴，辣子？今天该吃什么？明天该吃什么？有了联合政府，我们各民族都有人在里面，就好办了。”他们觉得，只有以本民族干部为主的区域自治政府，才是自己的政府，否则虽是“好的政府”，仍然不是“自己的政府”。这种民族感情，应该加以充分尊重。
    然而，有些汉族工作人员，对于培养和提拔少数民族干部这一工作的重要性还是认识不足的。他们往往对少数民族干部提出过高的要求，对他们缺乏适当的照顾和帮助，只认为“弱”，认为需要“再锻炼锻炼”，“再考验考验”；而对于少数民族中的知识分子，则又往往不适当地强调他们的阶级出身，而忽视了团结改造的工作；对于少数民族的风俗习惯，往往认为是他们思想意识“落后”的表现。这些不正确的态度，当然严重地妨害培养和提拔少数民族干部的工作。
    中央民族学院还需要负责训练一批作少数民族工作的汉民族干部。这个力量，也是少数民族政治经济文化事业的发展所必需，和各少数民族人民所欢迎的。但也还有些少数民族人士不很了解汉民族干部对于各少数民族的重要性。他们急躁地要求即刻将本民族的事情完全交由本民族来做，这也是不正确的。应该认识，在今天的条件下，进行少数民族地区的恢复和建设工作，还不能缺少汉民族干部的帮助。当然，到少数民族地区工作的汉民族干部，必须与当地民族建立友爱、合作的亲密的关系，遵照当地民族大多数人民的意志办事，而不是凭着一己的意见办事，同时还应该认真地向当地民族的人民群众学习，学习他们的语言，懂得他们的风俗习惯，体会他们的民族感情，努力培养自己成为一个少数民族工作干部所必要的一切条件，以便更好地为少数民族人民服务。而按照这些要求来训练汉民族干部，也正是民族学院的重要任务之一。
    中央民族学院已经开学了，各少数民族人才的花朵，在毛主席民族政策的春风披拂下，将日盛一日地开放起来。我们为少数民族工作无限光明前途而祝贺。
