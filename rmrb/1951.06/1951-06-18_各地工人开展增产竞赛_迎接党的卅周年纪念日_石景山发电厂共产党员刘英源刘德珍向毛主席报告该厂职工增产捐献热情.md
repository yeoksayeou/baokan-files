Xinhua News Agency, June 17th: Workers across the country are further launching patriotic emulation campaigns to welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, and are putting forward various production guarantees to use greater production achievements as gifts.

Workers at the Changxindian Railway Factory are enthusiastically launching a production increase and donation movement to welcome "July 1st." All workers in the factory's machine shop unanimously stated that they would thoroughly implement the patriotic covenant, regularize the competition, and ensure that the June production task is completed six days ahead of schedule. In addition to ensuring that this year's first-half production task will be completed on June 15th, workers in the wheel and water tank shop will also make two new water tanks before "July 1st." The boiler shop will also make a new driver's shed this month. To welcome "July 1st," workers at the train inspection station of the Xifuxin Inspection Section challenged workers at the train inspection stations of Sujiatun, Jinzhou, and Huangguantun Inspection Sections on the 7th of this month, guaranteeing that the train will not be delayed by one minute due to inspection and repair, and striving for 500 days of accident-free train inspection. Workers at the Xifuxin Locomotive Depot Factory launched a labor competition on June 9th to welcome "July 1st." Each production team in the factory has put forward guaranteed figures for the utilization of waste products. One team will use waste products to repair a rejuvenated air pump and revive a 15-ton small pickaxe, and guarantee that one cylinder removal can run 35,000 kilometers without leakage; another team will use waste products to make two water tank brackets, one light wheel decomposition rack, etc. Workers at the Bei'an Locomotive Depot guarantee that there will be no accidents in June to welcome "July 1st."

In addition, workers from the Andong Electric Power Bureau and a paper mill in Yingkou have also put forward specific guarantees to eliminate accidents and complete production tasks ahead of schedule to welcome the birthday of the working class's own party. The Hu Guangbi team of the Kaifeng Repair and Assembly Plant of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau set out competition conditions at the end of May to challenge workers across the Central and South China region to welcome "July 1st." To welcome the Party's birthday, workers at the Tianjin Tram Company guaranteed that the trolleybus would be opened to traffic on "July 1st" and are now stepping up various preparations. All employees of the sewing department of the Tianjin Garment Factory wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on June 15th. In addition to reporting on the production situation in the past year, the letter also reported on their various activities to welcome "July 1st." The letter concluded by saying to Chairman Mao: "More than two years of liberation have proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the working class fully exert its wisdom and have true freedom, happiness, and glory. Recalling the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to a more beautiful socialist and communist society, we sincerely thank you and the Communist Party you lead. We will definitely make persistent efforts... to fight for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, building a great motherland, and finally realizing a communist society."

[Reported by this newspaper] Communist Party member Liu Yingyuan, director of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, and labor model Liu Dezhen wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, reporting that all party members and employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant are determined to welcome the great birthday of the Party with actions to improve production, increase production, and make donations. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise leadership, all party members and all employees of our Shijingshan Power Plant reduced the coal consumption rate, which accounts for about 50% of the power generation cost, by 3% when we welcomed "July 1st" last year. Last year, we initially achieved safe power generation and exceeded the cost by 9.25%. This year, in order to welcome the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, and in response to the call of the General Association for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, all our employees have used their brains and came up with more than 20 specific production increase methods, striving to overfulfill the state production plan and ensure that we create 1.5 billion yuan of wealth in half a year to increase the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. At the same time, all our employees have launched a movement to donate equipment, and everyone has donated motors, transformers, theodolites, universal ammeters, electric drills... that they have saved in the past to the country. It was decided to donate the bonuses obtained from rationalization proposals and creating new records to purchase airplanes and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Now all our party members and all employees have carefully revised the patriotic covenant and launched a patriotic labor competition in the workshop. Due to continuous technological improvements, coal consumption has been reduced by 14.5% compared to "July 1st" last year. In order to fully supply the capital's industrial power and people's electricity, we have thoroughly overhauled all machinery, electrical, and furnace equipment over the past year. We assure you: we must continue to overcome shortcomings in our work, reduce costs, consolidate the achievements of safe power transmission, and strive unremittingly to strengthen the country's economic construction and national defense construction.

Wishing you good health.

Liu Yingyuan, Liu Dezhen
