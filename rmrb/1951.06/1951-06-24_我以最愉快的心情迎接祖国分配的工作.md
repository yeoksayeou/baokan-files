To the Editor:

　　The government's policy of unified assignment of jobs to graduating students from universities and colleges makes me deeply feel the happiness and pride of being a youth in New China! I greet the glorious task assigned to me by the motherland with the utmost joy.

　　In 1947, I studied at Northwest University. Under the reactionary rule at that time, persecution, unemployment, and hunger threatened the vast majority of the people. That year, among the graduating students of Northwest University, apart from a very few who found jobs through various "connections," the vast majority could not find employment. At the graduating students' "farewell party," they all looked worried; after the "farewell party" was over, they still couldn't find work, anxiously like ants on a hot pan. I remember a student named Guan Zhonghui who graduated from the Department of Economics, and because there was really no other way, he finally had to return home to cultivate two acres of vegetable garden; his travel expenses home were still scraped together by many students with three thousand or five thousand [currency] each.

　　"Graduation means unemployment," this most common, yet most serious threat in the Kuomintang era, I had deeply "experienced."

　　Now, I am about to graduate. Our president and provost explained in detail to the graduating students the situation of the central People's Government's State Council's allocation of jobs to graduating university students. The government is taking care of us so thoughtfully, and wants to arrange us properly in the places where the motherland needs us most. This makes me deeply feel the lovableness of the motherland and the great responsibility we bear.

　　Today, every youth in New China has a bright future under the education of the Communist Party. This is what the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought us. Now, as the 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching, I would like to assure the Party: no matter what job the government assigns me to, I will humbly start from scratch, work hard, and contribute my strength to the Party and the people.

### 我以最愉快的心情迎接祖国分配的工作

　　我以最愉快的心情迎接祖国分配的工作编辑同志：
    政府统一分配高等学校毕业学生工作的政策，使我深刻地感觉到作一个新中国青年的幸福和骄傲！我以最愉快的心情迎接祖国交给自己的光荣任务。
    一九四七年，我在西北大学念书。在那时反动统治下，迫害、失业和饥饿威胁着广大人民。那年西北大学毕业同学，除了极少数通过各种“关系”找到职业以外，其余大部分人都找不到职业。在毕业同学“欢送会”上，他们都愁眉苦脸；“欢送会”开过了，他们仍旧找不到工作，着急得像热锅上的蚂蚁一样。记得有个经济系毕业的管仲晦同学，因为实在没有办法，最后只得回到家里经营了二亩菜园；他回家的路费还是许多同学们三千、五千地凑起来的。
    “毕业就是失业”，这个在国民党时期最平常，然而却是最严重的威胁，我是深深“领教”过的。
    现在，我就要毕业了。我们的校长和教务长详细地给毕业同学讲解了中央人民政府政务院分配高等学校毕业学生工作的情况。政府对我们照顾得是如此周到，要把我们妥善地安排到祖国最需要我们的地方去。这使我深深感到祖国的可爱和我们责任的重大。
    今天，每一个新中国的青年，在共产党的教育下都有着光明的前途。这是共产党和毛主席带给我们的。现在，在党三十周年纪念日快要来到的时候，我愿意向党保证：无论政府把我分配到什么工作岗位上去，我都要虚心地从头学起，努力工作，为党、为人民贡献出自己的力量。
