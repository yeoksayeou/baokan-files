Reader's Letter

    Libraries Should Collect Readers' Opinions to Help Publishing Houses Improve Their Work
    To the Editor:

    Our Sunan People's Publishing House often sends books and periodicals to libraries in various places as complimentary copies. The libraries also reply to us after receiving the books and periodicals. However, the reply letters often only contain polite words such as "Thank you for your kind gift… It has been placed on a special shelf in our library and is very popular with readers." I think such letters do not help the publishing house. If libraries could keep more "Reader Opinion Books," widely collect public opinions on books and periodicals, and then pass them on to the publishing house to help the publishing house improve its work, this would be much more meaningful than writing a thank-you letter after receiving complimentary books and periodicals.
                    Sun Dalong, Sunan People's Publishing House

    Editor's Note: Comrade Sun Dalong's opinion is very correct. Libraries should frequently inform publishers of the circulation of books and periodicals and readers' opinions. This is an important method to strengthen the connection between libraries, readers, and the publishing industry. It will greatly help publishing houses improve their work.

### 图书馆应搜集读者意见  帮助出版机关改进工作

专栏：读者来信

    图书馆应搜集读者意见  帮助出版机关改进工作编辑同志：
    我们苏南人民出版社经常把书刊赠送给各地图书馆。各地图书馆收到书刊后也来信答复我们。但答复信中，常常只写“承蒙赐阅……业已在本馆专架陈列，备受读者欢迎。”等客气话。我认为，这样的信对出版机关是没有什么帮助的。如果各地图书馆能够多备些“读者意见簿”，广泛收集群众对书刊的意见，然后转告出版机关，帮助出版机关改进工作，这样，就比收到赠阅书刊后写一封道谢信的意义大得多了。
                    苏南人民出版社  孙大龙
    编者按：孙大龙同志的意见是很对的。各地图书馆应该经常把书刊流通情况及读者意见告诉出版者。这是加强图书馆、读者和出版界联系的重要方法。大有助于出版机关改进自己的工作。
