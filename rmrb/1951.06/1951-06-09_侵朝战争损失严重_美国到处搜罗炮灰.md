　　Xinhua News Agency, June 8th, dispatch from Cairo by TASS, June 6th: The Egyptian newspaper *An-Nida*’s reporter, Khattum, reported that the United States and Britain had held talks to discuss the issue of dispatching British troops to Korea. It is said that Britain refused to send more troops because it believed that due to the situation in Egypt, Iran, Syria, and other Near East countries, it was necessary to station a large number of troops in these areas.

　　However, according to the reporter, Britain suggested sending so-called "volunteer" forces from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to Korea. In Kassala, the forced recruitment of these "volunteers" has already begun.

　　Another TASS dispatch from Rome, June 6th, citing *Forward* in Belgrade, states: The families of Yugoslav Chetniks and Ustaše elements detained by the United States in concentration camps in West Germany and Austria have recently received notices from the Red Cross reporting that their relatives have died in Korea. It is said that they went there "voluntarily." *Forward* pointed out that the American authorities in West Germany and Austria have long been recruiting these people to participate in the Korean War, promising them freedom after the war, sending them back to their country, and pardoning their past crimes. These promises were guaranteed by the Yugoslav government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 7th, dispatch from Manila by Telepress, June 5th: American senior military officers in Manila revealed that the desertion incidents in the Li Chengwan army and the people's opposition to the Li Chengwan army's forced conscription have caused serious distress to the U.S. invading forces in Korea. The U.S. military authorities are taking new measures to force South Korean people to serve as cannon fodder.

　　The main method used by the U.S. military authorities to implement forced conscription is to deliberately create refugees. They force Korean people to retreat southward. After these refugees arrive in the south, they have no housing, food, or medicine, and cannot find work. Therefore, the U.S. military has established recruiting stations in refugee concentration areas, issuing food ration cards to hungry people who are willing to join the army.

　　侵朝战争损失严重
    美国到处搜罗炮灰
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社开罗六日电引埃及安尼达报记者卡土姆报道，美国和英国曾举行谈判，讨论派遣英国军队到朝鲜去的问题。据说英国拒绝再派军队，因为英国认为由于埃及、伊朗、叙利亚以及其他近东国家的局势，有必要在这些地区驻扎大量军队。
    但是据该记者报道，英国建议派英埃苏丹的所谓“志愿”部队到朝鲜去。在卡萨拉，强迫招募这种“志愿兵”的工作已经开始了。
    另据塔斯社罗马六日电引前进报贝尔格莱德消息说：被美国拘留在西德和奥地利集中营的南斯拉夫契特尼克和乌斯塔希分子的家属近来常接到红十字会的通知书，报告他们的亲人已在朝鲜牺牲。据说他们是“志愿地”前往那里的。前进报指出，西德和奥地利的美国当局老早就在招募这些人去参加朝鲜战争，答应他们在战争结束之后便让他们自由，送他们回国并赦免他们过去的罪过。这些诺言并经南斯拉夫政府担保。
    【新华社七日讯】据电通社马尼拉五日讯：马尼拉的美国高级军官们透露，李承晚军队的逃亡事件和人民反对李承晚军队强迫征兵的行动，使侵朝美军当局感到严重的苦恼。美军当局正在采取新措施，强迫南朝鲜人民充当炮灰。
    美军当局实行强迫征兵的主要方法就是故意制造难民。他们强迫朝鲜人民向南撤退。这些难民到南方以后，没有房屋、粮食和医药，也找不到工作。于是，美军在难民集中地区建立起募兵站，把口粮配给证发给愿意参军的饥民。
