Economic Life Trends

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Summer Harvest in Huaiyin Prefecture, Northern Jiangsu
　　Huaiyin Prefecture in northern Jiangsu, which has suffered from floods for six consecutive years, had a bumper summer harvest this year. Last winter, the area planted nearly 9 million mu of wheat, barley, broad beans, rapeseed, and other crops. The average yield per mu was about 100 jin, more than double that of last year, reaching the normal yield before the disasters. The lake and marshlands, which previously had no harvest for years, yielded an average of about 200 jin of wheat per mu this year. The best wheat fields in Qingyi Lake and Sijia Dang in Shuyang County yielded 400 jin per mu.
　　In early June, millions of farmers in the area, under the slogan "Ensure a Good Harvest of Patriotic Wheat," actively organized labor exchange and mutual assistance for the summer harvest. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties, including Huaiyin and Suqian, 400,000 farmers formed more than 25,000 mutual aid teams, joining the patriotic summer harvest competition. Currently, the summer harvest work in the entire area is nearing completion.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Farmers in Yankan Village, Xikang, Convert Tobacco Fields to Grain Fields
　　After farmers in Yankan Village, Lushan County, Xikang Province, converted tobacco fields to grain fields last winter, the yield of spring crops this year increased by more than double compared to last year, and the lives of farmers have been initially improved. Before liberation, like thousands of villages in Xikang Province, the village was forced by the Kuomintang reactionary government and local bullies to cultivate opium on a large scale. More than 70 percent of the village's 1,004 mu of land was used to grow opium, resulting in a reduction in the area planted with food crops and causing a serious food shortage. In addition, many villagers were addicted to drugs, leading to extremely difficult lives for the farmers.
　　After liberation, the People's Government led the people of the village to ban opium and, last winter, mobilized farmers to convert tobacco fields to spring crops. This summer, the village harvested a total of 247 shi of grain, more than double that of last year. Due to the bumper harvest, the lives of many farmers in the village have also improved. Many families have also become harmonious because farmers have quit drugs.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Handmade Paper Industry in Jiajiang Largely Restores Production
　　The handmade paper industry in Jiajiang County, Western Sichuan, has now largely restored production, and it is estimated that 3,000 tons of paper can be produced this year. Currently, the number of paper-making workshops in the county has recovered from more than 200 in the early days of liberation to more than 2,800, approaching the number during the peak period of the War of Resistance Against Japan. To enable most of the closed workshops to resume production, state-owned trading organizations raised the price of paper by one to three times according to the price ratio last year to purchase about 300,000 jin of paper from the workshops. The People's Bank also successively lent more than 1 billion yuan to the workshops for production funds. This year, the People's Government organized the Federation of Industry and Commerce and workshop representatives to form a unified purchasing group to purchase raw materials for paper-making in the raw material production areas, eliminating the previous layers of intermediate exploitation to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and reduce paper-making costs. With the development of the land reform movement in various places, the demand for paper in rural areas has increased. Since February this year, paper merchants from all over the country have come to Jiajiang to order goods, and the supply of paper is already falling short of demand.

            苏北淮阴专区夏季丰收
    连续六年遭受水灾的苏北淮阴专区今年夏季丰收。该区去冬共种植小麦、大麦、蚕豆、油菜等作物近九百万亩，平均每亩产量一百斤左右，超过去年一倍，已达到灾前常年产量。以往连年无收的湖荡田，今年平均每亩收麦二百斤左右。沭阳县青伊湖、司家荡的麦田内最好的每亩收四百斤。
    六月初，该区千百万农民在“保证收好爱国麦”的口号下，纷纷组织变工互助进行夏收。仅据淮阴、宿迁等八个县不完全统计，即有四十万农民组成了二万五千多个互助组，卷入了爱国主义的夏收竞赛热潮，目前全区的夏收工作已近结束。

            西康堰坎村农民把烟田改为粮田
    西康省芦山县堰坎村农民去冬把烟田改为粮田后，今年小春作物比去年增产一倍以上，农民生活已初步得到了改善。解放前，该村和西康省千百个农村一样，在国民党反动政府与恶霸地主强迫下，大量种植鸦片。全村一千零四亩土地中，百分之七十以上的土地种植鸦片，以致农作物种植面积缩小，造成严重粮荒。加以该村吸食毒品的很多，因此，农民生活极为痛苦。
    解放后，人民政府领导该村人民禁绝了烟毒，去冬，又动员农民把烟田改种小春作物，今夏全村共收粮食二百四十七石，比去年增加一倍以上。由于丰收，该村许多农民的生活也得到改善。许多农民由于戒绝了烟毒，家庭也和睦了。

            夹江手工造纸业大部恢复生产
    川西夹江县手工造纸业，现已大部恢复生产，预计今年可产纸三千吨。目前全县造纸槽户已由解放初期的二百余家恢复到二千八百余家，接近抗日战争中极盛时期的户数。为使大部歇业槽户恢复生产，去年，国营贸易机构曾分别按物价比例提高纸价一至三倍收购槽户存纸约三十万斤。人民银行也先后贷给槽户生产资金十余亿元。今年，人民政府又组织工商业联合会、槽户代表成立统一采购组，到原料产地采购造纸原材料，免去过去所受层层中间剥削，以保证原料的充分供应，并使造纸成本降低。随着各地土地改革运动的开展，农村对纸张的需要增加，今年二月份以后，各地纸商纷至夹江订货，纸张已有供不应求之势。
