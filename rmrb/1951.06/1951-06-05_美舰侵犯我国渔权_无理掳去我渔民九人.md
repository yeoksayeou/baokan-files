Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 4th. On May 15th, warships of the U.S. troops invading Korea infringed upon our fishing rights and unjustifiably abducted nine of our fishermen in the Yellow Sea. The incident is as follows:

Fishermen from the "Wang Li Shun" and "Song Fa Xing" boats, belonging to the Ocean Island of Changshan County, Lüda City, were fishing in the sea about 200 li southeast of the island at about 8 p.m. on the 15th. At that time, a large white U.S. warship suddenly came from the southeast, heading directly towards the "Wang Li Shun" fishing boat. To prevent the small boat from being damaged by the U.S. warship, the fishermen on the "Wang Li Shun" fishing boat lit a lamp as a signal. Unexpectedly, after the U.S. warship discovered the light on the fishing boat, it accelerated and approached the boat. A Japanese person on the ship, speaking broken Chinese, sternly asked the fishermen, "What are you doing?" The fishermen told him that they were fishing boats from Ocean Island, fishing here. The warship then detained the fishing boat, and sent two Americans in military uniforms and a Japanese person to forcibly search the fishing boat, forcing the boat owner, Wang Qichao, and five fishermen to board the ship. After capturing five people from the "Wang Li Shun" fishing boat, the warship continued to sail north, approached the "Song Fa Xing" fishing boat, and captured four fishermen. Six fishermen, including Yang Zhihong, escaped from the two boats and returned safely to the island on May 20th.

Note: In recent days, incidents of U.S. warships harassing our fishermen at sea have continued to occur. At about 2 a.m. on May 24th, when fisherman Wu Yuanmou from Ocean Island was fishing in the sea about 50 li southeast of the island, he also encountered a white U.S. warship, and an American soldier with a translator forcibly boarded our fishing boat, unreasonably questioning and searching the boat's contents. The fishermen on Ocean Island are extremely angry about this.

　　美舰侵犯我国渔权
    无理掳去我渔民九人
    【新华社大连四日电】五月十五日，美国侵略朝鲜军队的军舰，侵犯我国渔权，在黄海海面上无理掳去我国渔民九人。事件经过如下：
    旅大市长山县所属海洋岛上“王利顺号”、“宋发兴号”两船渔民，于十五日晚八时许在该岛东南二百华里左右海上捕鱼。当时，突由东南方向开来大型白色美国军舰一艘，直向“王利顺号”渔船驶来。“王利顺号”渔船渔民为防小船被美舰撞坏，乃点灯为记。不料美舰发现渔船上灯光后，即加速驶近该船。舰上有一日本人操不纯熟之中国话向渔民厉声问道：“什么干活的？”渔民告诉他说，是海洋岛的渔船，在这里捕鱼。该舰遂将渔船扣留，并派了两个身着军服之美国人和一个日本人，到渔船上强行搜查，逼令船主王起超及渔民共五人登舰。该舰在“王利顺号”渔船捕去五人后，又继续北驶，靠拢“宋发兴号”渔船，捕去渔民四人。两船的脱险者有渔民杨志红等六人，已于五月二十日安全返岛。
    按：连日来美舰在海上骚扰我国渔民之事件不断发生。五月二十四日晨二时许，海洋岛渔民吴远谋驾驶渔船在该岛东南五十里左右之海面上捕鱼时，亦遇一白色美舰，并有一美军携一翻译强行登我渔船，无理盘查和搜翻船上物品。海洋岛上渔民对此极为愤怒。
