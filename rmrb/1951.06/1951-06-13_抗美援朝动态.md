　　　　Resist America, Aid Korea Movement of Railway Workers Nationwide
　　The Resist America, Aid Korea movement of railway workers nationwide has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics, as of May 1, 73.4 percent of the 530,000 employees had participated in accusation meetings, 60 percent had participated in the "May 1" grand demonstration, 80 percent of the employees and more than 200,000 family members had signed in support of the peace pact, and 77 percent of the employees and more than 187,000 family members had voted against the United States arming Japan. Many regions have conducted patriotic propaganda for passengers and farmers along the railway line, mobilizing more than 254,000 passengers to sign and nearly 200,000 passengers to vote. Railway workers in various regions have also generally signed patriotic conventions. In the patriotic movement, patriotic activists in various regions have widely adopted forms such as blackboards, wall newspapers, reading groups, radio stations, mobile propaganda teams, propaganda trains, clubs, cultural and artistic troupes, amateur drama troupes, and film teams to carry out propaganda and education work, which has greatly improved the labor enthusiasm of railway workers, their willingness to participate in aid to Korea, their assistance to the government in exposing counter-revolutionary elements, and the development of production competitions. It has also played a great role in improving the political awareness of passengers.
　　However, there are still many blank spots and weak areas in the patriotic movement among railway workers nationwide, especially small stations, work areas, water supply stations, signal buildings, bridge watchmen, canteen workers, barbers, and scattered family members of employees who have not yet received patriotic education. In areas where education has been carried out, it is generally not in-depth. There are also cadres who do not attach importance to patriotic education and regard it as a short-term task. The railway leadership has begun to correct these shortcomings.
　　　　Mutual Aid County in Qinghai Formulates Annual Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda Plan
　　Mutual Aid County in Qinghai Province inspected the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education work and formulated an annual propaganda work plan. The plan requires cadres from counties and districts going to the countryside to combine various tasks and arrange propaganda work in accordance with the current situation and tasks, inspect it in a timely manner, and strive to ensure that each cadre publicizes to 500 people; cadres staying in the organs should also use their spare time to publicize to the masses in various forms, striving for 200 people per person, and always collect statistics and summarize at the end of the year. At the same time, in the propaganda and education of each period, attention should be paid to cultivating activists in rural areas and establishing a propaganda network. Attention should be paid to the leadership and inspection of the established propaganda network organizations.
