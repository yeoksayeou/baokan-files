Visiting the Mothers of Volunteer Soldiers
By our reporter Lu Sheng

　　On the thousands of miles of the Huai River harnessing front, in the vast rural areas of the Huai River basin, I saw many mothers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Their children are fighting day and night on the Korean battlefield for the people of the motherland; although they themselves are old, they are also actively working hard on the Huai River harnessing and production front. They recognize that the interests of the motherland and their own interests are consistent.

　　In the ancient town of Gucheng Village (belonging to Fengtai County in northern Anhui) on the bank of the Huai River, there is an old woman named Jiang Yan, who is fifty-seven years old this year. She hoes wheat after returning from the Huai embankment, and hoes sorghum after hoeing wheat, never idle for a day. Through an introduction, I learned that she is the mother of three volunteer soldiers who are fighting for the happiness of the Chinese and Korean people. With respect, I went to visit her. As soon as she opened her mouth, she said: "I have three sons in total, all fighting the American devils on the Korean front!" Fearing that I wouldn't understand, she introduced them to me one by one:

　　"The eldest son is called Jiang Zhenjiang, and he is a squad leader in the Volunteers. The second son is called Jiang Zhenhai, and he is a battalion commander in the artillery battalion of a certain division of the Volunteers. The third son is called Jiang Zhenchao, and I sent him to Korea in the first month of this year." As she spoke, she took out a picture of her second son for me to see. A heroic image of a Chinese People's Volunteer appeared before my eyes.

　　She smiled and said, "Look how strong and spirited he is, the American devils are guaranteed to be afraid of him!" I said, "The American devils are afraid of him, but peace-loving people all over the world love him." She smiled and showed me the yellow blanket and new quilt laid on her bed, and also took out the rice and RMB given to her by the People's Government. She said with a smile:

　　"Comrade, these are all given to me by the country and the people!"

　　While listening to the old woman's moving words, I looked at the clean table and the farm tools on the ground in her house. The old woman swept the dust off the bed and continued: "Before there was a country with the people as masters, I fled famine every year. I raised all three sons by carrying them on my back in ragged cotton-padded coats and begging for food. Now that we have Chairman Mao and a country with the people as masters, I have food, clothing, housing, and quilts. I heard the working comrades read in the newspaper that the American devils wanted to come and attack our China again, so I quickly sent my sons to join the Volunteers. Comrade, why do you think I sent all three sons to the Korean front? I think: without a country, there is no home. Look, what sins did I suffer before there was a country with the people as masters? What kind of life am I living today with a people's country? It's not just me! Go and see, the old women in our village are all like me, no longer fleeing famine and begging for food (she pointed to a group of children jumping around in the yard), and these little dolls are no longer growing up on their mothers' backs."

　　Before leaving, I asked her if she had any difficulties in her life? The old woman waved her hand and said: "No, no. I can work myself, and the country and the people are helping me, I have no difficulties at all. I just think every day: we are no longer fleeing famine and begging for food, but there are still many working people in the world who are bombed, massacred, and fleeing every day, living the same life as we did three years ago. When I think of this, I can't help but want to run to Korea and tell my three sons: quickly kill all those American devils, so that all the working people in the world can live a good life."

　　Similar mothers can be seen everywhere in our motherland.

　　On the Xiage Embankment (the embankment between Chenxi Lake and Jiangjia Lake in western Huoqiu County) section in the middle reaches of the Huai River, an old woman of fifty-four years old led village cadres and women's representatives to the embankment to comfort the migrant workers. At that time, spring had just arrived on the Huai River, and everywhere was a beautiful scene of emerald green wheat seedlings and the fragrance of birds and flowers. But at this time, some migrant workers felt uneasy because they thought that the manure from their homes had not been delivered to the fields. For example, the "Du Mu Squad" originally dug three cubic meters of soil per person per day; because they were uneasy, it dropped to two cubic meters. After this old woman came to the embankment, she understood the thoughts of the migrant workers and told all the migrant workers in the squad: "I have distributed the relief grain, coal, and grass recently issued by the government to your families; I have organized women and livestock to deliver all the manure from your homes to the fields; we planted more than 3,000 mu of sorghum in your homes in five days. Today I ran more than seventy miles to comfort you, if you have any difficulties, please feel free to raise them, and I, as a woman, can solve them." As a result, all the migrant workers in the "Du Mu Squad" were moved, and they formulated ten patriotic conventions for harnessing the Huai River that night without sleeping. The next day, each person carried one more cubic meter of soil, and then it increased day by day to more than six cubic meters.

　　Who is this old woman? She is Ding Qilan, the women's director who pioneered the work in Du Mu Township, and also a mother of a Chinese People's Volunteer soldier.

　　Ding Qilan is from Du Mu Township in Huoqiu County, northern Anhui. When this township was first liberated, she organized women to seize Yang Gangmin, the landlord tyrant, bandit leader, and puppet Baochang who had ruled the township for many years, and exposed more than seventy long and short guns, and sent him to the government to be executed. Since then, she has become the leader of the people of Du Mu Township. Last year, when the flood rose, she led more than eighty women to fight the flood, so that Du Mu Township suffered little loss. After the flood, she organized men to engage in sideline production and organized women to plant more than 200 mu of radishes. In winter, she led 260 women to the Huai embankment to build dams. This spring, because all the men went to the Huai embankment, she led the women to plant all the land in the township. In the fifty days of spring repair work, she came to the Huai embankment three times to comfort the migrant workers. The migrant workers on the Xiage Embankment all called her "Old Activist Aunt Ding."

　　Why is she so active?

　　She has given birth to eight children, and each child was raised by carrying them on her back or carrying them in a basket, fleeing famine and begging for food. She said: "Raising children is not easy; but when they grow up, floods drown them, Chiang Kai-shek grabs them as conscripts, and now only two sons are left! The older one is twenty-four years old this year, and the younger one is twelve years old. I sent the older one to Korea to resist America, and the younger one is going to school, and when he grows up in the future, I will also call him to join the army and work for the country."

　　"Comrade, you want to ask me why I do this? You will understand if you look at the life I lived before. In the past, when Chiang Kai-shek's landlord tyrants were kings in China, I gave birth to eight children in my life, and six of them were killed by them. In the past, I didn't have a foot of land, but today I was allocated five mu of land, and I also received government relief and assistance, and my life is getting better and better. I am anxious when I hear that the American devils are massacring children in Korea every day. I think: who wants to watch their own children be killed alive? I know it is not easy to raise children. Our people here are the masters of the country, and children can grow up well with their mothers, but in Korea there are still many children who are being ruined, and American imperialism still wants to come to China again to kill children. Mothers who have raised children, who can bear to ignore it? Thinking of this, I sent my child to Korea to resist America."

　　Volunteer soldiers are our most lovable people; the mothers of these most lovable people are also so admirable and lovable!

　　访问志愿军战士的母亲们
    本报记者  鲁生
    在千里治淮战线上，在淮河流域的广大农村里，我看到许多中国人民志愿军的母亲。她们的孩子都在朝鲜战场上日日夜夜地为祖国人民战斗着；她们自己虽然年老，也积极在治淮和生产战线上紧张地劳动着。她们认识了祖国和自己的利益是一致的。
    在淮河岸上的古城村（属皖北凤台县），有一位老大娘蒋阎氏，今年五十七岁。她从淮堤上回来就锄麦子，锄过麦子又锄高粱，一天也不闲。经人介绍，我才知道她就是为中国与朝鲜人民的幸福而战斗着的志愿军的三个战士的母亲。我怀着敬爱的心情去访问她时，她一开口就说：“我一共有三个儿子，都在朝鲜前线对美国鬼子作战哩！”她还怕我听不明白，就一个个地给我介绍：
    “大儿子叫蒋振江，在志愿军里当班长。二儿子叫蒋振海，在志愿军某师炮兵营当营长。三儿子叫蒋振朝，是今年正月我送他到朝鲜去的。”说着，她把她二儿子的像片拿出来给我看。一幅雄纠纠气昂昂的中国人民志愿军形象出现在我的眼前。
    她笑着说：“你看他身体多结实，多有精神，美国鬼子管保怕他哩！”我说：“美国鬼子怕他，全世界爱好和平的人民可都爱他。”她笑着让我看她床上铺的黄毯子和新被子，又拿出人民政府送给她的大米、人民币。她笑着说：
    “同志，这些都是国家和人民给我的！”
    我一边听着大娘这句动人的谈话，一边看她家放着干净的桌子和地上的农具。老大娘扫了一下床铺上的灰尘又继续说：“从前没有人民作主人的国家，我年年逃荒。三个儿子都是我用破棉袄背在背上逃荒要饭养大的。现在有了毛主席，又有了人民作主的国家，我有了吃，有了穿，有了房子住，有了被子盖。我听工作同志念报说：美国鬼子又想来打咱们中国，我就连忙送俺儿去参加了志愿军。同志，你说我为什要把三个儿子都送到朝鲜前线去？我想着：没有国就没有家。你看，从前没有人民作主的国家，我受的是什么罪？今天有了人民的国家，我过的是什么日子？不光我呀！你去看看俺村的老婆婆都像我一样不逃荒要饭了（她又指着院里蹦蹦跳跳的一群孩子们），这些小娃娃们也不再在她娘背上生长了。”
    临走我问她生活有没有困难？老大娘摆摆手说：   “没有，没有。我自己会劳动，国家和人民又帮助我，我什么困难也没有。就是天天想着：俺们不逃荒要饭了，可是天下还有好多劳苦人天天遭轰炸，受屠杀，逃难，过着像俺们三年前的一样日子，我一想到这里，就恨不得想跑到朝鲜去，告俺的三个儿子说：快些杀光那些美国鬼子，好叫天下劳苦人都过好日子。”
    类似这样的母亲，在我们祖国到处可以见到。
    在淮河中游的下格堤（霍邱县城西湖和姜家湖之间的堤防）工段上，有一位五十四岁的老大娘率领村干部和妇女代表来堤上慰问民工。那时春天刚到了淮河上，到处是翠绿色的麦苗和鸟语花香的美景。可是就在这时候，有些民工想到家里的粪还没送到地，心就不安起来。比如“杜母中队”，原来每人每天能挖三公方土；因为心不安就下降到两公方。这位老大娘来到堤上后，了解了民工的思想，就告给该中队全体民工说：“最近政府发下来的救济粮、煤、草，我都分给你们各家了；你们家里的粪土，我已组织妇女和牲口全送到地了；你们家的三千多亩高粱，我们五天就全种上了。今天我跑七十多里来慰问你们，大家有什么困难尽量提出来，我老婆都能解决。”这一来，“杜母中队”全体民工都受了感动，当夜没睡就订出了十条治淮爱国公约，第二天每人就多挑了一公方土，以后一天天增加到六公方多。
    这位老大娘是谁？就是那开辟杜母乡工作的妇女主任丁其兰，也是中国人民志愿军战士的一位母亲。
    丁其兰是皖北霍邱县杜母乡人。这乡刚解放时，她就组织妇女抓住统治该乡多年的地主恶霸、土匪头子伪保长杨刚民，斗出他七十多条长短枪，把他送到政府枪决了。从此，她就成了杜母乡人民的领导者。去年涨大水时，她领导八十多个妇女抢险，使杜母乡受损失不大。大水后她组织男人去搞副业生产，组织妇女种下二百多亩萝卜。冬天，她又带领二百六十个妇女上淮堤打坝。今春因为全体男人都上淮堤，她就领导妇女把全乡的土地种起来。在五十天春修工程中，她就来淮堤上慰问过三次民工。下格堤上民工都称她是“老积极丁大娘”。
    她为什么这样积极呢？
    她生过八个孩子，每个孩子都是背在背上，挑在篓里，逃荒要饭养大的。她说：“养孩子不容易；可是养大了，洪水淹，蒋介石抓壮丁，到如今只剩下两个儿子！大的今年二十四岁、小的十二岁。大的我送他到朝鲜去抗美了，小的上学念书了，将来长大我还要叫他到军队里为国家出力。”
    “同志，你要问我为什么这样做？你看看我从前过的日子就会明白。从前蒋介石地主恶霸在中国为王，我一辈子生八个孩子，就被他们害死六个。过去我没一脚地，今天我分到了五亩地，又得到政府救济帮助，日子越过越好。我听到美国鬼子天天在朝鲜屠杀孩子就发急。我想着：谁愿意看着亲生的孩子活活被杀死？我知道养大孩子不容易。我们这里人民当了国家的主人，孩子可以跟着娘好好地长大了，可是在朝鲜还有好多孩子正在受糟蹋，美帝国主义还想再来中国杀孩子。养过孩子的母亲，谁能够忍心不管呢？想到这里，我就送俺孩子到朝鲜去抗美了。”
    志愿军战士是我们最可爱的人；这些最可爱的人们的母亲，也是多么的可敬可爱啊！
