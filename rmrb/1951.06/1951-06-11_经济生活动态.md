    Shandong Dongguang County Dongyang Village: Mutual Aid Teams and Cooperatives Combine for Great Benefits
    In Dongyang Village, Dongguang County, Shandong Province, mutual aid teams have been consolidated and developed by combining with the work of cooperatives. The number of mutual aid teams in the village has increased from four to fifteen, with full and semi-laborers participating accounting for over 70% of the village's total labor force.
    In 1950, the mutual aid teams received timely supplies of pesticides from the township cooperative, preventing mole crickets and red spiders. The cotton yield reached about 150 jin per mu, resulting in surplus products for the mutual aid teams. At this point, the township cooperative further established member groups in each mutual aid team, purchasing cotton, peanuts, strip baskets, etc., produced by the mutual aid teams at reasonable prices and responsible for selling them to other places. They also supplied the mutual aid teams with daily necessities and agricultural implements at low prices. In the winter of the same year, eight mutual aid teams in the village organized eleven carts to transport cotton for the township cooperative, earning over 9,500 jin of millet, which they used to buy eight cattle and three carts, increasing their productive capacity. This year, the township cooperative has signed contracts with the mutual aid teams for the pre-purchase of cotton, and the mutual aid teams have also requested the township cooperative to prepare pesticides and supply new agricultural implements.
    Anhui Southern Anhui Prefecture Cooperatives: Overfulfilled the Task of Converting Green Tea to Black Tea
    Cooperatives at all levels in the Huizhou Prefecture of southern Anhui organized tea farmers to convert green tea to black tea, and by May 22, they had overfulfilled the conversion task. Huizhou Prefecture is known throughout the country for its "Qihong" and "Tunlv" teas (i.e., Qimen black tea and Tunxi green tea). This year, to meet the needs of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic countries, the district's tea production policy is to "increase red and reduce green" and "convert green to red." In early February, under the leadership of the Qimen Black Tea Promotion Committee, cooperatives at all levels went deep into the tea-producing areas to conduct propaganda, dispelling tea farmers' concerns about "not converting well" and "low selling prices." They also organized more than 400 skilled black tea technicians to provide technical guidance in green tea areas and established 18 black tea processing plants. In late April, cooperatives at all levels began purchasing converted black tea. Initially, the purchasing stations could only receive about ten loads of wet crude tea per day, but after publicity, the purchase volume gradually increased, and general purchasing stations could receive 200 to 300 loads. According to statistics up to May 22, the three green tea producing counties of Xiuning, Shexian, and Yixian had completed the conversion of nearly 800,000 jin, exceeding the task by 11%. The cooperative organizations in the green tea producing areas also achieved great development in this work.

    Shandong Province Promotes Soil and Water Conservation Projects
    The soil and water conservation project promoted by the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry this spring in the mountainous area of Juyi County (newly established county) in the upper reaches of the Shu River has been mostly completed. Promoting soil and water conservation projects is one of the basic methods to cure river floods. The upstream of the rivers on all sides of the main peak of Mount Yi in Shandong Province has never had facilities to accumulate floodwater, and the trees on the mountain have been cut down and the slopes have been cultivated. Whenever heavy rain comes, the mud, sand, and stones on the mountain are washed down by the flood, causing serious floods in the lower reaches of the river. Over time, the fertile fields downstream have also been washed into barren sandy land.
    To change this situation, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry had already piloted a mountain soil and water conservation project in Yazhuang District, Juyi County, in the upper reaches of the Shu River last year, adopting methods such as building dams to block water in mountain gullies and building slow-flow dams to retain sand and accumulate water. According to the test results, after the flood season last year, the flood volume in the lower reaches of the Shu River was obviously less than in previous years, and the flow rate was slower. Behind the slow-flow dams, white ash trees and other plants can also be cultivated on the sandy land that has been silted up with mud and sand. In order to cooperate with the implementation of this project, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has also implemented mountain closure for afforestation in Juyi County and mobilized local farmers to plant trees extensively.

            山东东光县东阳村互助组和合作社结合好处大
    山东省东光县东杨村的互助组，由于与合作社工作相结合，得到了巩固和发展。全村由四个互助组发展到十五个互助组，入组的整、半劳动力已达全村的百分之七十以上。
    一九五○年，互助组得到乡合作社及时供应治虫药剂，防治了蝼蛄和红蜘蛛，每亩棉花收了一百五十斤左右，因此，互助组有了剩余产品。这时，乡合作社也就进一步在该村每个互助组里都成立了社员小组，以合理价格收购互助组生产的棉花、花生、条筐等，负责推销到外地；并廉价供应互助组生活必需品和农具。同年冬天，该村八个互助组又组织十一辆大车给乡合作社运棉花，赚了九千五百多斤小米，买进八头牛和三辆大车，增加了生产的力量。今年乡合作社已与互助组订立了预购棉花的合同，互助组亦向乡合作社提出了准备治虫药剂和供应新式农具的要求。
            皖南徽州专区合作社  超额完成改制红茶任务
    皖南徽州专区各级合作社组织茶农把绿茶改制红茶，至五月二十二日，已超额完成改制任务。徽州专区茶产以“祁红”“屯绿”（即祁门的红茶、屯溪的禄茶）闻名全国，今年为适应苏联与东欧人民民主国家的需要，该区产茶的方针是“增红减绿”与“改绿为红”。二月初，在祁门红茶推广委员会领导下，各级合作社深入茶区宣传，打破茶农“怕改不好”、“怕售价低”等思想顾虑；并组织了四百余名精制红茶的技师到绿茶区作技术指导，还成立了十八个红茶加工厂。四月下旬，各级合作社开始收购改制后的红茶。收购站起初每天只能收到十来担湿的红毛茶，以后经过宣传，收购量逐步增加，一般收购站已能收到二百担到三百担。到五月二十二日统计，绿茶产地休宁、歙县、黟县三县已改制完成近八十万斤，超过任务百分之十一。绿茶产区的合作社组织也在这次工作中获得了很大的发展。

            山东省推行水土保持工程
    山东省农林厅今春在沭水上游莒沂县（新设县）山区推行的水土保持工程，现已有大部分完成。推行水土保持工程是根治河流水患的基本方法之一。山东省境的沂山主峰四侧河流的上游向来没有积蓄洪水的设施，加以山上的林木被砍伐，山坡被开垦，每遇大雨到来时，山上的泥沙、石子即被洪水冲刷而下，造成河流下游严重的水灾。日子久了，下游肥沃的田地也被冲刷成贫瘠的沙土地了。
    为改变这种情况，山东省农林厅在去年即曾在沭水上游莒沂县的崖庄区试办山区水土保持工程，采取在山沟内筑坝堵水和筑缓水坝等办法，拦沙积水。这一办法经试验结果，去年汛期以后，沭水下流的洪水量显然比往年少，而且流速较慢；在缓水坝后，被泥沙淤平了的沙地上，还可培植白蜡树等植物。山东省农林厅为了配合这项工程的进行，又在莒沂县实行封山育林，并发动当地农民广泛植树。
