The People's Governments of Hebei, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui provinces and regions are currently leading and organizing the masses to vigorously kill locust nymphs. Due to scarce rainfall this spring, the aforementioned four provinces and regions have experienced locust nymph outbreaks since early May, severely affecting the growth of various crops. In Huanghua County, Hebei Province, five districts have discovered 310 nymph swarms, covering an area of over 16,500 mu. Cang County, Jing County, En County, and other counties in the province have also successively experienced locust nymph outbreaks. In the northern Anhui region, in the five districts and nine townships along the lake in Sihong County, locust nymphs have infested an area approximately 20 li long and 4 li wide, with over 100 nymphs per square foot. The locust and locust nymph infestation in Xinhailian City, Shandong Province, and Guanyun County in northern Jiangsu is quite severe.

After the locust nymph outbreaks, local people's governments prepared a large number of pesticides and equipment, mobilizing the masses of farmers to vigorously kill them. The Huanghua County People's Government of Hebei Province organized more than 4,000 people to dig 40 li of blocking ditches in the locust-affected areas of the county to prevent the spread of nymph swarms. The county also plans to mobilize farmers in the locust-affected areas to use pesticides and equipment to kill the locust nymphs, striving to eliminate all locust nymphs before the wheat harvest. The Cang County Special Zone put forward the slogan "Strike early, strike small, strike completely," calling on farmers to quickly eliminate locust nymphs. In Sihong, Yongcheng, and other places in northern Anhui, farmers have formed locust-catching teams, carrying 10,000 jin of pesticides and 24 powder sprayers to rush to the locust-affected areas to kill them. Farmers in Funan County have already caught and killed more than 300 jin of locust nymphs. In addition, the People's Governments of Shandong Province and northern Jiangsu have also provided large amounts of pesticides and equipment, organizing farmers to eliminate locust nymphs.

　　河北、山东、苏北、皖北等省区人民政府
    领导组织群众大力捕杀蝗蝻
    河北、山东、苏北和皖北等省区人民政府，现正领导和组织群众大力捕杀蝗蝻。上述四个省区因今春雨水稀少，自五月上旬起先后发生蝗蝻，严重地影响着各种农作物的生长。河北省的黄骅县五个区，已发现三百一十片蝻群，约合面积一万六千五百亩以上。该省沧县、景县、恩县等县也相继发生蝗蝻。皖北区泗洪县沿湖五个区九个乡，发生蝗蝻面积约长二十里，宽四里，每平方尺有蝗蝻百余只。山东省的新海连市和苏北区的灌云等县的蝗虫和蝗蝻为害相当严重。
    蝗蝻发生后，各地人民政府准备了大批药械，发动农民群众大力捕杀。河北省黄骅县人民政府组织群众四千余人，已在该县蝗区挖好四十里长的封锁沟，以防止蝻群蔓延。该县并计划发动蝗区农民使用药械捕杀，争取在麦收前将蝗蝻全部消灭。沧县专区提出“打小打少打了”的口号，号召农民迅速消灭蝗蝻。皖北区泗洪、永城等地农民已成立捕蝗队，并携带农药一万斤，喷粉器二十四架，赶赴蝗区捕打。阜南县农民已捕打蝗蝻三百余斤。此外，山东省和苏北区的人民政府也贷放了大批药械，组织农民消灭蝗蝻。（新华社）
