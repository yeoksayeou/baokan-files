Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to TASS, an award ceremony was held on the 13th at the Kremlin in the Soviet Union to award the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace" to Park Jung-ai, Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's League. The ceremony was attended by Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, and representatives from all walks of life. Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the Stalin International Peace Prize Committee, presented Park Jung-ai with a certificate and a gold medal, and delivered a speech praising Park Jung-ai's significant contribution to the common cause of progressive mankind, and expressing the Soviet people's love and sympathy for the heroic Korean people. Subsequently, Tikhonov and others delivered congratulatory speeches.

Park Jung-ai said in her reply: "Receiving the Peace Prize is not only an honor for me personally, but also an honor for the entire Korean people. The Korean people's hatred for the enemy is like a raging fire, which will never be extinguished, just like our desire for peace. We are determined to defeat the US aggressors' conspiracy to launch a world war, and to fight alongside the people of all countries for the defense of peace.

The Korean people were very happy when they learned that I had won the Stalin Peace Prize. Workers in various factories passed resolutions at celebration meetings, demanding increased production beyond the plan to supply the needs of the front and the rear. I have donated 100,000 rubles as a prize to provide education for the children of Korean patriots who have sacrificed themselves for the motherland. In the future, I will further strengthen the struggle against aggression." Park Jung-ai's speech was warmly welcomed.

　　朴正爱接受斯大林和平奖金
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十三日在苏联克里姆林宫举行授奖典礼，以“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金授与朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱。参加典礼的有苏联拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫和各界代表多人。斯大林国际和平奖金委员会主席斯科贝尔琴把奖状一纸和金质奖章授与朴正爱后，发表演说，称颂朴正爱对进步人类的共同事业的重大贡献，并表示苏联人民对英勇斗争的朝鲜人民的热爱和同情。接着吉洪诺夫等人相继致祝词。
    朴正爱致答词说：“领受和平奖金不仅是我个人的荣誉，而且是全体朝鲜人民的荣誉。朝鲜人民对敌人的仇恨一如烈火，它永不熄灭，正如我们对和平的热望一样。我们决心打败美国侵略者发动世界大战的阴谋，和世界各国人民在一起为保卫和平而斗争。
    朝鲜人民知道我获得斯大林和平奖金的消息后非常欢喜，各工厂的工人在庆祝会上纷纷通过决议，要超计划增加生产以供应前方和后方的需要。我已把十万卢布奖金捐出来，作为朝鲜已为祖国牺牲的爱国者的子女的教养费，今后我将要更为加强反侵略的斗争。”朴正爱的演说受到热烈的欢迎。
