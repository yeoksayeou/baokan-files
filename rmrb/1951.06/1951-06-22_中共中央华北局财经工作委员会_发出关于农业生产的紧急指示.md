The Financial and Economic Work Committee of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, based on the current progress of agricultural production in North China and the occurrence of insect pests, issued the following emergency instructions on the 21st of this month:

Currently, it is the most intense and decisive season for agricultural production. Especially since many areas are now experiencing drought and various insect pests are widespread, our task is even more challenging. Any relaxation in this situation could lead to serious losses. In order to ensure the complete realization of the patriotic production increase plan, we hope that all localities will adopt a tense, fighting spirit and do the following work well:

First, urgently mobilize to eliminate various insect pests. The current insect pests are very serious, especially aphids and locust nymphs. Aphids have infested 90 percent of cotton fields in the plains, and have also occurred in more than 30 counties in Hebei. The threat of locust nymphs is even greater. In Hebei and Pingyuan provinces alone, they have occurred in more than 40 counties and are developing rapidly. In Huanghua County, Hebei, locust nymphs were initially found in only over 80,000 mu of cultivated land. Although actively killed, in less than a month, locust nymphs have developed to more than 200,000 mu. In severely affected areas, one can trample 30 or 40 to death with one foot, and grab 50 or 60 in one handful on the grass. As a result, locust nymphs have reached the third or fourth instar. If they cannot be eliminated within ten days, they will cause widespread harm. Other insect pests are also very serious. Insect pests are the biggest enemy of agricultural production. In the past years, the losses caused by insect pests have been great. Therefore, there should be no negligence in pest control. However, in some areas, the masses have not been seriously led to control insect pests. Generally, there are more calls than actions. Some rely on aircraft and scientific drug sprayers and relax the organization of the masses to kill. As a result, many pests have not been eliminated in time, but have developed instead. This should be strictly checked and immediately corrected. In areas where insect pests have been found, an emergency mobilization should be launched to fully utilize machinery and medicines, organize the masses to seriously catch and kill them, and implement the spirit of "strike small, strike few, and strike early," so as to achieve timely, thorough, and complete annihilation, and never allow them to spread. In areas where insect pests have not occurred, preparations should be made seriously, medicines and machinery should be prepared, and strict investigation and inspection should be carried out. Intelligence should be exchanged, so that they can be discovered and eliminated in time.

Second, fight drought to protect seedlings and plant seeds. Currently, many areas are experiencing drought again, which not only threatens the seedlings that have emerged from the soil, but also seriously affects the summer planting tasks. The summer planting tasks in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces are very heavy. Up to now, 50 percent of the late fields in Pingyuan have not been planted due to drought. Therefore, fighting drought to protect seedlings and fighting drought to plant seeds have become urgent tasks. The most effective way to protect seedlings from drought is to mobilize the masses to hoe more, hoe finely, and surround the roots with soil. In some areas where drought prevents seedlings from growing unless they are watered, the masses can be mobilized to widely utilize and develop water sources for irrigation. On the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, households with wells and water can be mobilized to lend to households without wells and water. In areas where water sources are difficult, attention should be paid to economical water use, and pits and holes can be dug near the roots of seedlings for irrigation. Those who have not planted due to drought, in addition to developing and fully utilizing water sources, should mainly mobilize the masses to seize the opportunity to plant when the soil is moist, and change the old habits of farmers of "not being busy with summer planting" and "threshing first and planting later." In addition, it is also possible to experiment with promoting water seeding and seedling planting methods. In short, our slogan is: All that should be planted must be planted, plant one mu more is one mu more, plant one tree more is one tree more. Those who cannot plant should prepare short-term crop seeds as soon as possible so that they can be planted in time after rain.

In addition, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to hoe seedlings, which is an effective way to increase production and prevent insects and drought. Water conservancy work and cotton carding should also be carried out as soon as possible.

The central link in doing the above work well lies in closely integrating patriotic education and fully mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm for patriotic production. At the same time, we must attach importance to the work of mutual aid teams to solve the difficulties of too much farm work and insufficient labor.

　　中共中央华北局财经工作委员会
    发出关于农业生产的紧急指示
    中共中央华北局财经工作委员会根据华北目前农业生产进展及虫害发生等情况，特于本月二十一日发出以下紧急指示：
    目前是农业生产最紧张的带有决定性的季节。特别因为许多地区现在又呈旱象，各种虫害也普遍发生，就更加重了我们的任务。对于这种情况，如稍有松懈，就会造成严重损失。为了保证爱国丰产计划的完满实现，希望各地用紧张的战斗精神，做好以下工作：
    第一，紧急动员起来，消灭各种虫害。目前的虫害是很严重的，尤以蚜虫、蝗蝻最为严重。平原有百分之九十的棉田发生蚜虫，河北也有三十余县发生。蝗蝻的威胁则更大，只河北、平原两省，即有四十余县发生，且发展甚速。河北黄骅县，最初只在八万余亩的耕地中发现蝗蝻。虽经积极扑杀，但不到一月，蝗蝻已发展到二十余万亩。严重地区一脚可踏死三、四十个，随便用手在草上一捞，一把可抓五、六十个，致蝗蝻已达三龄或四龄，如十日之内不能消灭，将为害甚广。其他虫害也甚严重。虫害是当前农业生产上的最大敌人。历年以来，虫害造成的损失是很大的，故对除虫工作绝不容有任何麻痹疏忽。但有若干地区，还未认真领导群众，除治虫害，一般还是号召多于行动，有的则仰赖飞机与科学药械喷杀，而放松了组织群众扑打。因此，许多害虫未能及时扑灭，反而发展了，这是应该严格加以检查和立即加以纠正的。在已发现虫害的地区，应紧急动员起来，充分运用药械，组织群众认真捕杀，贯彻“打小，打少，打了”的精神，做到及时彻底、干净歼灭，绝不让其蔓延。在未发生虫害的地区，要认真作好准备，备妥药械，严密侦查、检查，互通情报，做到及时发现，及时消灭。
    第二，抗旱保苗，抗旱下种。目前很多地区又呈旱象，这不仅威胁着已出土的禾苗，而且严重影响夏种任务。河北、平原两省的夏种任务是很大的。平原至目前止，仍有百分之五十的晚田因为天旱未能下种。因此，抗旱保苗与抗旱下种，又成为当前的急务了。抗旱保苗的最有效办法，是发动群众多锄、细锄、根部围土；在某些地区因天旱而非浇水不能维持禾苗生长者，可发动群众，广泛运用与开发水源浇灌；并在自愿两利的原则下，发动有井有水户借给无井无水户使用；水源困难者，更应注意经济用水，可在禾苗根部附近挖坑、钻孔浇灌。因旱未下种者，除开发与充分运用水源外，主要应发动群众乘墒抢种，改变农民中“夏种不忙”，“先打场，后下种”的老习惯。此外，也可试验推行水耧耩种及育苗栽种办法。总之，我们的口号是：应种的要全种上，多种一亩是一亩，多种一棵是一棵。种不上者，要及早备妥短期作物籽种，以便雨后及时下种。
    此外，要抓紧锄苗，这是增产与防虫、防旱的有效办法。水利工作与棉花打卡，也应抓紧进行。
    做好上述工作的中心环节，在于紧紧结合爱国主义教育，充分发动群众爱国生产的积极性。同时，必须重视互助组工作，以解决农事太紧太多而劳力不足的困难。
