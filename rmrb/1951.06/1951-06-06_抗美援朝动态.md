            Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region
    The Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region has further developed since April of this year. Propaganda and education work on Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea has been carried out in fifteen counties, including Ganzi and Ba'an, and patriotic demonstrations have been held.座谈会 in counties such as Luhuo and Danba, symposiums on Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea have been held with lamas, Tusi (local chieftains), heads, youth, and women. In the Muya area, where Tibetans are concentrated in Kangding, lamas, Tusi, herdsmen, and others, after denouncing the crimes of American imperialism in looting their livestock and money, and insulting lamas, have actively participated in the struggle against American aggression and aid to Korea, and have unanimously signed patriotic covenants. Eighty-six percent of the population in the urban area of Kangding has received patriotic education on Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea.
    The preliminary experiences of carrying out the Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea Movement in the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region are: (1) Propaganda and education work on Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea must proceed from the actual conditions of minority areas, unite influential figures among the Tibetans, including upper-level figures with influence among the masses and patriotic activists among the masses. Experience has shown that first conducting patriotic education for them makes it easier to promote the movement universally. (2) For the counties "outside the pass" (south and north of Kangding), which have vast areas, it is necessary to first convene a representative conference on Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea attended by local Tusi, heads, and Kambu (title of the person in charge of the affairs of the lama temple) of the lama temples, mobilize them to go back to carry out propaganda, and organize cadres to assist them, so that the movement can be widely carried out. (3) The propaganda movement for Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea in minority areas, like in other areas, must be combined with the current central work, so that Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea becomes the driving force for promoting national unity and suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

            抗美援朝宣传工作丛刊出版
    抗美援朝总会编辑的《抗美援朝宣传工作丛刊》。已由北京人民出版社出版五辑：第一辑，《把抗美援朝运动推进到新的阶段》（定价六千元）；第二辑，《怎样在城市中开展抗美援朝运动？》（定价四千三百元）；第三辑，《怎样在农村中开展抗美援朝运动？》（定价四千八百元）；第四辑，《怎样在工人中开展抗美援朝运动？》（定价四千九百元）；第五辑，《开展抗美援朝运动的方式方法》（定价四千七百元）。这五册书选辑了各地报刊所发表的有关抗美援朝运动方针及经验的重要材料，是各地群众宣传工作者和爱国运动的积极分子们的重要参考读物。
    又，朝鲜前线通讯集现已出版七辑。这部通讯集，是进行爱国主义和国际主义教育的重要教材。（请参看人民日报六月三日第六版《出版动态》中的《朝鲜前线通讯集出版》一文）。
            西康藏族自治区的抗美援朝运动
    西康藏族自治区的抗美援朝运动，自今年四月后已有进一步的开展。甘孜、巴安等十五个县都作了抗美援朝的宣传教育工作，举行了爱国示威游行。炉霍、丹巴等县并召开了喇嘛、土司、头人、青年、妇女等抗美援朝座谈会。康定藏族聚居的木雅区的喇嘛、土司、牧民等在控诉了美帝国主义过去抢劫他们的牲口、钱财及污辱喇嘛等等罪行以后，积极卷入抗美援朝的斗争，并一致签订爱国公约。康定城区有百分之八十六的人口已受到抗美援朝爱国教育。
    西康藏族自治区开展抗美援朝运动的初步经验是：（一）进行抗美援朝的宣传教育工作必须从少数民族地区的实际情况出发，团结藏族中有威信的人物，包括在群众中有影响的上层人物及群众的爱国积极分子。经验证明：首先向他们进行爱国教育，就易于把运动普遍推动起来。（二）对于地区辽阔的“关外”（康定以南及以北）各县必须首先召开地方土司、头人、喇嘛寺堪布（主持喇嘛寺事务者的职名）等参加的抗美援朝代表会议，发动他们回去宣传，并组织干部予以协助，这样才能使运动广泛开展。（三）少数民族地区的抗美援朝宣传运动和其他地区一样，必须和当前中心工作结合，使抗美援朝成为推动民族团结，镇压反革命等工作的动力。
