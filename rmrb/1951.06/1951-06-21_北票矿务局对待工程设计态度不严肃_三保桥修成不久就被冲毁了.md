The Beipiao Mining Bureau of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration repaired the Sanbao Bridge in October 1949 to restore the Guansan Line (the railway line between Guanshan Mine and Sanbao Mine under the jurisdiction of the Mining Bureau). This bridge repair cost a huge sum of 1.3 billion yuan. However, by the early summer of 1950, the bridge, which had not been completed for long, was washed away due to a slight increase in the water level.

The bridge foundation had been built during the puppet Manchukuo period; the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang renovated it and later destroyed it. The Beipiao Coal Mining Bureau restored the bridge on the original foundation. Due to changes in the river channel, the original bridge site was located on the bend of the river. The water flow is on the outer side of the bend, and due to centrifugal force, the scouring force is very large, and the bridge foundation forms a 45-degree angle with the main flow line, which further increases the impact of the main flow on the bridge. During construction, the load-bearing capacity of the original bridge piers was not well estimated, and eight-meter-high columns were added to the piers, and overweight steel beams were placed on them, resulting in a top-heavy situation and the piers being unable to support the weight.

When the Beipiao Coal Mining Bureau started to repair the Sanbao Bridge, it did not conduct detailed research on the old bridge foundation; although it found that the old bridge foundation had been shaken, it did not pay attention to it. The bridge was designed by general construction technicians, who did not understand the necessary knowledge of hydraulic engineering, such as drainage volume and water flow velocity, and did not conduct detailed investigations in advance. The bridge had thirteen spans during the puppet Manchukuo period and was changed to seven spans during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule; the Beipiao Coal Mining Bureau did not conduct in-depth research and changed it to four spans, so that when the water level was slightly higher, the water could not be discharged quickly. After the bridge design was completed, it was not submitted to the higher authorities for review and approval before construction was started rashly.

In order to complete the task urgently, the Beipiao Coal Mining Bureau was also very careless in the construction. For example, when driving bridge piles, the water pump had an accident, and the engineering staff, fearing that it would affect the completion time, did not follow the drawings and reduced the pile driving depth by one meter; other problems included using furnace ash as a ballast bed, and mixing furnace ash into the white lime mortar used for masonry; this greatly reduced the bonding strength of the mortar and had a great impact on the bridge's firmness. Although the Sanbao Bridge project was led by the Construction Committee, the personnel were mostly laymen and failed to carry out effective inspections.

The Beipiao Coal Mining Bureau always treated the design work of the Sanbao Bridge with an extremely unserious attitude. Therefore, the Sanbao Bridge was washed away shortly after it was barely completed.

### 北票矿务局对待工程设计态度不严肃  三保桥修成不久就被冲毁了

　　北票矿务局对待工程设计态度不严肃
    三保桥修成不久就被冲毁了
    东北煤矿管理局北票煤矿矿务局于一九四九年十月，为恢复冠三线（即该矿务局所管辖的冠山矿到三宝矿中间的铁路线）抢修了三保桥。这次修桥共用了十三亿元的巨额工款。但到一九五○年夏初，这座竣工不久的桥就因为水位略增而被冲毁了。
    该桥在伪满时已筑成桥基；蒋介石匪帮统治时，曾加以改修，后又破坏。北票煤矿矿务局是在原基础上恢复该桥。因为河道的变迁，原桥位已处于河流的湾道上。水流在湾道外侧，因离心力关系，冲刷力很大，而桥基与主流线成四十五度角，更加重了主流对该桥的冲击力。修建时，对原桥墩的载重力没有很好地估计，就在墩上加了八公尺高柱，放上过重的钢梁，结果头重脚轻，桥墩无力。
    北票煤矿矿务局在开始抢修三保桥时，对旧桥基没有详细研究；虽然发现旧桥基已经动摇，但没有重视。该桥系由一般的建筑技术员所设计，他们对水利工程上的必要知识，如排水量、水的流速等都不懂，也没有在事先加以详细调查。该桥在伪满时为十三孔，蒋介石匪帮统治时改为七孔；北票煤矿矿务局没有深入研究，就改为四孔，以致水位稍高时，水就无法迅速排泄。该桥设计完成后，也未送上级机关审查批准，就冒然施工。
    北票煤矿矿务局为了急于完成任务，在施工方面，也很马虎。如打桥桩时，水泵发生了事故，工程人员怕影响竣工时间，就不按图施工，打桩比原深度减少一公尺；其他如用炉灰垫道床，在砌石用的白灰浆中掺炉灰；使得灰浆的凝结强度大为降低，对桥的坚固也有很大的影响。三保桥工程虽有建设委员会的领导，但人员多系外行，也未能切实进行检查。
    北票煤矿矿务局始终以极不严肃的态度对待三保桥的设计工作，因此，三保桥勉强修成后，不久就被冲垮了。
