Hurry Up and Eliminate Cotton Aphids and Red Spiders

Currently, cotton aphids have occurred and are spreading in major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, and the Northeast. Red spiders have also been found in some areas. Historical experience proves that insect pests seriously affect the bumper harvest of cotton. Timely control of aphids can generally increase the yield per unit area by 30%. According to experiments conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing in 1949: the yield of ungrafted Sizi No. 4 cotton was 122 jin of seed cotton per mu; the yield of grafted cotton was 169 jin of seed cotton. Assuming that half of the cotton fields in the country will be affected by aphids in 1951, and universal control can be achieved, with an increase of 30% per mu, then more than 3 million dan of ginned cotton can be increased. Although the area where red spiders spread is not as wide as that of aphids, the damage is the most severe. In the most serious cases, there may be no harvest of cotton at all. In order to ensure the completion of the cotton production task in 1951 and strive for high yields per unit area, vigorously organizing and leading farmers to control cotton aphids and red spiders is an urgent task that must be carried out immediately in agricultural production.

Past experience has proven that the prevention of insect pests should adopt the principle of prevention over treatment, and seize the time to carry out the work as early as possible. Once insect pests occur, they must be eradicated thoroughly and quickly, otherwise they will develop into serious disasters. This year, aphids have occurred most severely in the northern cotton areas. The main reason is that we went all out to carry out drought resistance and sowing in the spring, and the work of weeding and preventing aphids was not carried out vigorously; in addition, cotton seedlings were underdeveloped due to drought and lack of rain, and their resistance was weak, so the pest damage will be even more severe. We must face this reality, raise our vigilance a hundredfold, and strengthen the work of preventing and controlling insect pests.

Not all cadres and farmers have fully realized the severity of aphids and red spiders. Taking Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province as an example, the district is an old area with a good work foundation. Last year, when aphids were controlled, many farmers and even some cadres had the idea of relying on heaven for food and did not believe in science. They felt that "natural disasters cannot be cured." Some cadres and masses wanted to control insects, but they did not know what method to use. Therefore, we must not be blindly optimistic and think that since newspapers and pamphlets have introduced many methods, it means that farmers have learned how to prevent and control them. According to a survey in several major cotton-producing provinces this spring, some people and cadres do not even know the simplest method of treating aphids with tobacco water. Therefore, running a large number of short-term training courses for cadres and active farmers, and holding cotton farmers' symposiums under the principle of not hindering production, unblocking ideas, and teaching prevention methods should be the first important task in launching the prevention and control of cotton pests.

Fully preparing insecticidal drugs and machinery is the second important task in doing a good job in insect control. At present, the most widely used method for controlling aphids is spraying and dipping with tobacco water. However, the situation this year is that tobacco is in short supply and the price is very high (about 7,000 to 10,000 yuan per jin), and even tobacco stems are not easy to buy. The old stocks of rotenone powder in various places were all used up last year. On the other hand, the cotton fields far exceed last year's area. This cannot be estimated according to the normal situation, and insecticidal drugs and machinery must be prepared as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary losses. In addition to making full use of possible collected native tobacco leaves, tobacco rods, and waste tobacco from cigarette factories, other effective native agents should also be promoted and a large amount of cotton oil soap and cotton oil emulsion should be used to prevent and control aphids. Because these two things are easy to obtain and manufacture, easy to use, and have great power. The method of preparing cotton oil emulsion with hard water after simple treatment, which was successfully developed by the Pharmaceutical Factory of the Plant Protection Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, and the method of preparing safe cotton oil emulsion, which was successfully developed by Professor Huang Ruilun of Beijing Agricultural University (Agricultural Science Newsletter, Third Year, First Issue—published in January 1951), can be widely adopted. However, it is estimated that the preparation technology cannot be popularized in a short time, and many people find it troublesome and would rather spend money to buy cotton oil soap than make it themselves. Therefore, cotton oil soap (ie, black soap sold on the market) should be manufactured in a planned and organized manner. If the leadership departments at all levels can pay attention to this issue and organize local soap factories to make a batch of black soap in accordance with the cotton oil soap manufacturing method issued by the Plant Protection Department of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, and lend it to the masses through cooperative and other business institutions, it is easy to do and will be very effective. For the prevention and control of red spiders, it is even more necessary to make ideological and material preparations (such as lime sulfur mixture) in a timely manner, and start prevention and control as early as possible. Otherwise, once the cotton leaves are damaged and turn yellow, prevention and control will be difficult. Therefore, we must select some experienced and active farmers to strengthen observation work, and once discovered, immediately report to the leading organs and organize a large-scale siege and quickly eliminate them. In addition, when the vast number of farmers are mobilized to eliminate insect pests, the existing sprayers in the countryside are far from enough. In addition to vigorously concentrating and repairing existing sprayers, the immersion method must also be widely promoted.

The season when insect pests are most serious is also the season when agricultural work is the most intense in summer harvesting and summer planting. Therefore, calling on farmers to organize, rationally use labor, and mobilize and organize a large number of women to participate should become the third important task in eliminating cotton aphids and red spiders.

All plant protection stations and cotton production guidance area farms and other staff and technicians in cotton producing areas must work hard with a high degree of enthusiasm for serving farmers, not only to be good technical guides, but also to become good organizers.

### 赶快消灭棉蚜和红蜘蛛

　　赶快消灭棉蚜和红蜘蛛
    目前棉花蚜虫已在河北、平原、山东、及东北等主要棉产区发生，并蔓延中。部分地区也已发现红蜘蛛为害。历史经验证明，虫害严重地影响着棉花的丰收。而及时防治蚜虫，一般可使单位面积产量提高三成。据中国科学院一九四九年在北京试验：未治蚜的斯字四号棉，每亩产籽棉一二二斤；治蚜的产籽棉一六九斤。假定一九五一年全国棉田有二分之一发生蚜害，又能作到普遍防治，每亩以增产三成计，那末，即可增产皮棉三百多万市担。红蜘蛛蔓延的面积虽不若蚜虫之广，但为害最烈。最严重时，可致棉花全无收成。为保证一九五一年棉花生产任务的完成，争取单位面积的丰产，大力组织领导农民防治棉蚜和红蜘蛛，是当前农业生产上必须立刻进行的一项紧急任务。
    历年经验证明，虫害的防治，应采取防重于治的方针，抓紧时间及早进行。虫害一但发生，尤须从速彻底除治，否则会演成严重的灾害。今年北方棉区蚜虫发生得最严重，主要原因是春季以全力进行抗旱播种，除草防蚜工作未能大力进行；又加棉苗因天旱雨缺，发育不良，抵抗力弱，虫害势将更加剧烈。我们必须面对这一现实情况，百倍提高警惕，加强防治虫害的工作。
    蚜虫红蜘蛛为害之烈，并不是所有干部农民，都已充分认识了的。即以河北省邯郸专区来说，该区是工作基础较好的老区，去年在发动治蚜时，很多农民甚至不少干部，都存在着靠天吃饭，不相信科学的思想。觉得“天灾治不了”。有的干部、群众想治虫，但不知道用什么方法治。所以我们决不能盲目乐观，以为报纸和小册子既已介绍过许多办法，就算是农民都学会防治了。据今年春季在几个主要产棉省的调查，有些群众和干部连最简单的烟草水治蚜方法都不知道。因此，大量开办干部及农民积极分子的短期训练班，在不妨碍生产的原则下召开棉农座谈会，打通思想，教授防治方法，应是发动防除棉花虫害的第一个重要工作。
    充分准备治虫药械，是做好除虫工作的第二个重要工作。目前群众广泛大量使用着的除治蚜虫方法是用烟草水喷沾。但今年的情况是烟草奇缺，价格十分高昂（每斤约七千元至一万元），连烟茎都不易买到。各地旧存的鱼藤粉，去年已全部用完。而另一方面，棉田却远超过去年的面积。这就不能按常年情况来估计，必须及早准备治虫药械，以免遭致不应有的损失。防治蚜虫的药品，除尽量利用可能搜集到的土烟叶、烟杆及卷烟厂的废品烟末外，并应发扬确实有效的其他土药剂，大量使用棉油皂及棉油乳剂。因为这两种东西取材与制造容易，使用方便，效力又大。中央农业部病虫害防治司的制药厂研究成功的以硬水经过简单处理配制棉油乳剂的办法，北京农业大学黄瑞纶教授研究成功的安全棉油乳剂的配制法（农业科学通讯第三年第一期——一九五一年一月出版），都可广泛采用。但估计配制技术非短时间所可普及，且不少群众嫌麻烦，宁愿花钱买棉油皂，不愿自己配制，因而棉油皂（即市售的黑肥皂）应有计划有组织的大量制造。如果各级领导部门能注意到这一问题，组织当地的肥皂厂按照中央农业部病虫害防治司颁发的棉油皂制法做一批黑肥皂，经过合作等业务机构贷售给群众，是容易办到，且收效会很大的。红蜘蛛的防治，更须及时作好思想和物质（如石灰硫磺合剂）的准备，及早下手防除。否则一旦棉叶被害发黄，防治就很困难了。因此，必须选定一些有经验的积极农民，加强观察工作，一经发现，立即报告领导机关，组织大力围治，迅速消灭。另外，在广大农民动员起来除治虫害时，乡间现有的喷雾器是很不够用的。除大力集中与修理现有喷雾器外，还须广泛推广浸沾的方法。
    虫害最严重的季节，也正是农事最紧张的夏收夏播季节。因此，号召农民组织起来，合理使用劳动力，并发动与组织大量妇女参加，应该成为除治棉蚜红蜘蛛中的第三个重要工作。
    一切棉产区的病虫害防治站、棉产指导区农场等工作人员、技术人员，必须以高度的为农民服务的热忱努力工作，不仅要作良好的技术指导者，也要成为良好的组织工作者。
