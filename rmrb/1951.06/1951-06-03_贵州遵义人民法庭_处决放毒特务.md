　　Guizhou Zunyi People's Court
    Executes Poisoning Spies
    [This Newspaper's Report] In Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, a poisoning case occurred during the May 1st Labor Day holiday. Through the collaborative efforts of people from all walks of life in the county and the public security organs, the Kuomintang "Anti-Communist League Committee" and "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" spy organization, which masterminded the poisoning and attempted arson, has been cracked. A total of twenty-four principal offenders and accomplices have been arrested. Among them, Liu Hengju, Zhu Xuewen, and Jia Jingren, the main culprits who planned the arson and poisoning, were publicly tried by the county's People's Court on the 13th of last month and executed by shooting.
    After the anti-revolutionary suppression movement began in Zunyi County in February of this year, a few remaining counter-revolutionary elements, such as Liu Hengju, stubbornly persisted in their mistakes, plotting to burn down Zunyi County. In late April, Liu and his gang secretly met twice and decided to prepare large quantities of poison and gasoline to poison all the drinking water wells in the city during the May 1st Labor Day rally and parade of people from all walks of life, and to set fire to all the houses in the city. However, due to the vigilance of the citizens of the county and the strict precautions taken by the military, government, and public security organs in the urban area, the attempt to poison was detected early. The arson plot of Liu and his gang failed, and only five water wells and some noodle shops and snack stalls were poisoned. As a result, 809 people were poisoned, and two children died due to severe poisoning.
    After the poisoning incident occurred, the county's People's Government immediately mobilized more than 40 Chinese and Western medicine doctors to establish ten rescue stations to rescue the poisoned residents. Workers from various factories and staff from government organs organized comfort teams to visit the poisoned residents and cooked mung bean soup to detoxify them. Li Subo, the commissioner of the Zunyi Commissioner's Office, also personally went to various streets and alleys to comfort the affected residents. Due to the rapid rescue, all 809 poisoned people in the city were cured, except for the two children who died.
    While rescuing the poisoned residents, the county's public security organs immediately mobilized people from all walks of life to assist in capturing the poisoning spies. Residents of the Seventh Street caught a poisoning spy in the Mujia Temple late at night in heavy rain. Residents of the Tenth Street also found two packages of poison in the home of Tian Bingchu, a spy who had already been shot. Based on the materials the county's public security organs had grasped on weekdays, the secret reports from citizens, and the confessions of the captured coerced accomplices, after clarifying the truth about the spy organization and its activities, they finally arrested all the poisoning criminals within seven days.
    After this poisoning incident, the vigilance of people from all walks of life in Zunyi County has been greatly enhanced, further preventing the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements. The catering industry and confectioners have formulated specific measures to strictly prevent poisoning by spies.

　　贵州遵义人民法庭
    处决放毒特务
    【本报讯】贵州省遵义县城区于五一劳动节发生特务分子放毒案件，经该县各界人民与公安机关协同搜捕，已将主谋放毒并企图放火的蒋匪“反共联盟委员会”及“反共救国军”特务组织破获，共捕获主犯及从犯二十四人。其中策动放火、放毒的首犯刘恒举、朱学文、贾竞仁三人，已于上月十三日经该县人民法庭公审后，执行枪决。
    今年二月，遵义县镇压反革命运动开始以后，刘匪恒举等少数漏网的反革命分子仍执迷不悟，图谋烧毁遵义县城。四月下旬刘匪等曾两次秘密集会，决定大量准备毒药、汽油，乘五一劳动节各界人民集会游行之际，在全城各食用水井放毒，并放火烧毁全城房屋，但由于该县市民的警惕，城关区军、政、公安机关戒备较严，对特务放毒事件发觉得早，刘匪等纵火阴谋未能得逞，仅在五口水井及一部分面食店和零食摊上放了毒药。结果有八百零九人中毒，有两个小孩因受毒甚重致死。
    特务放毒事件发生后，该县人民政府立即动员中西医生四十多人，成立十个救护站，抢救中毒居民。各工厂工人及机关工作人员，组织了慰问队，分别向中毒居民慰问，并煮绿豆汤给中毒者解毒。遵义专员公署专员李苏波亦亲往各街巷慰问受害居民。因抢救迅速，全城八百零九名中毒者，除小孩两人死亡外，其余全部治愈。
    与急救中毒居民同时，该县公安机关立即发动各界人民协助捕捉放毒的特务分子。七街居民深夜冒大雨在穆家庙捉住一个放毒的特务分子。十街居民也在已被枪决的特务分子田秉初家中搜出毒药两包。该县公安机关根据平日掌握的材料、市民密告及捕获的胁从分子的供认，搞清特务组织及其活动真相后，终将这批放毒的罪犯在七天之内都一一逮捕归案。
    此次放毒事件发生后，遵义县各界人民的警觉性已大大提高，进一步防范反革命分子的破坏活动。饮食业及糖果商等都已订出了严防特务放毒的具体办法。
