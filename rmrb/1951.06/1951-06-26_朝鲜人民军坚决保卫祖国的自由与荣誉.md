The Korean People's Army resolutely defends the freedom and honor of the motherland
    Nan Ri, Chief of General Staff of the Korean People's Army

    One year ago, the American imperialist bandits, at the instigation of their lackey, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, launched the Korean civil war.

    When our People's Army repelled the prepared invasion of the Syngman Rhee bandit army, which was directly armed by the United States, the American imperialists began their open armed intervention in our country. The aim of the American aggressors was to conquer the freedom-loving Korean people, enslave the Korean people, annex Korean territory, and turn it into a bridgehead for attacking our great neighbors—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—and other countries in the Far East. This put our country in a dangerous situation of being enslaved.

    To save this crisis, our People's Army bravely rose up to resolutely defend the freedom and honor of its young democratic People's Republic, and the entire Korean people also rose up in unison to participate in the struggle against the imperialists and their lackey, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. The attempt of the American ruling class to quickly and easily end the war of aggression against Korea has failed. The robbers who brought disaster and pain to our country have suffered and continue to suffer decisive resistance. Under these circumstances, it is not difficult to understand how farsighted it was for the Korean people and their government—the People's Republic government—to organize their armed forces in a timely manner for the honor and interests of the motherland.

    The history of the Korean People's Army is inseparable from the great democratic reforms carried out in our country after August 15, 1945, when Japanese imperialism was driven out of our country by the heroic Soviet army and Korea was liberated.

    Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, our people built our democratic country. It was only natural for the Korean people to feel the need to establish their own army to defend the interests of our young country and the new democratic and peaceful construction. More than three years ago, the Korean People's Army, which has blood ties with our people, was established.

    The army established by the Korean people is fundamentally different from the armies of capitalist countries. The first characteristic of our army is that it belongs to the people.

    In our country, the people and the army, generals and officers, non-commissioned officers and even soldiers, are united by common interests and goals, that is, by the goal of common struggle. The relationship between them is like that of a family. The People's Army is equipped by our people. From the very first day of establishing the People's Army, our people have not been afraid of armed people. Because the People's Army is not like the mercenary soldiers in imperialist countries such as Japan or the United States, aiming their guns at the working people solely to realize the will of colonial rulers, plunderers, and interventionists. In the northern half of our country, the armed people are the flesh and blood of the people—the sons and daughters of the working people. Precisely because of this, the People's Army has received universal and active support from the people since its initial establishment.

    The second characteristic of the People's Army is its spirit of patriotism. The soldiers of the People's Army love the land of their motherland, where the remains of their ancestors are buried and the lives of their descendants are tied, love the farmlands and forests that have been regenerated through free labor, as well as the underground and marine resources that have become the property of the people, and love the cities, villages, factories, enterprises, and schools, hospitals, theaters, and libraries built by the people themselves to improve the culture of the working people.

    For our soldiers, the most precious thing is the interests of the motherland and the construction of their own unified, independent, and free motherland. This is what they desire most.

    This genuine love for the motherland enables every combatant to rise up and participate in the struggle, enabling them to overcome all kinds of difficulties and obstacles, prompting them to display dedication and mass heroism, and ensuring that the People's Army can carry out its liberation mission.

    The third characteristic of our People's Army is its respect for the people of other countries and the high degree of internationalist education it receives.

    The soldiers of our army do not know racial discrimination and have no intention of aggression. The Korean People's Army firmly opposes the imperialist theory of racial "superiority" or "inferiority." We firmly reject the fallacy, vigorously advocated by American reactionaries, that one race should rule another. The spirit of internationalism permeates the entire lives of our soldiers and commanders. The great friendship between the People's Army and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers is proof of this. This friendship is forged in blood and has great significance. Fighting side by side against the common enemy, American imperialism, the Chinese People's Volunteers and our People's Army have countless stories of fraternal love and mutual assistance on the battlefield and in marching life.

    Hundreds of millions of kind people all over the world know that our People's Army and its comrades-in-arms—the Chinese People's Volunteers—are soldiers who bravely fight for the freedom, independence, unity, and democracy of their motherland, and for the happiness of their wives, parents, brothers, and sisters. Precisely because of this, our soldiers and the Chinese People's Volunteers have received the support, love, and respect of the working people of all people's democratic countries and all progressive mankind, headed by the great Soviet people.

    Last autumn, during the most difficult time of our motherland's liberation war, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—came to our country to help the Korean people fight against the American interventionists. This righteous action demonstrated the great and eternal friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples, and their common noble internationalist mission. The struggle waged by our People's Army against the American interventionists is to strengthen the peace, security, friendship, and mutual assistance of the people of all countries.

    The Korean People's Army inherited the fighting tradition of the people of its motherland in resisting oppressors for generations. This high degree of hatred for the destroyers of peace, and the tradition of displaying dedication and creativity in the struggle against the enemy, is even more evident in the heroic struggle against Japanese and American interventionists. Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, our heroic guerrillas, who had undergone severe tests of guerrilla warfare, became the strong core of the leading cadres of the People's Army. They have the valuable characteristics of the people's soldiers, namely, endurance, boldness, experience in mobile combat operations, creativity, boundless loyalty to their people and motherland, and boundless hatred for the enemy.

    They are trusted by the people and the People's Government, and constantly conduct military training, improve their theoretical and knowledge level, and educate new cadres.

    Under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the People's Government, the People's Army has actively carried out political education with high enthusiasm since its establishment, studying modern weapons and military science. To defend the motherland of the Korean people, liberated by the Soviet army, and their freedom and happiness, the combatants of our People's Army took up arms to guard against sudden enemy invasions.

    The above-mentioned training has strengthened the People's Army's understanding of the sacred task of defending the motherland, enabling them to inflict heavy blows on the enemy who violates the freedom and honor of the Korean people in any environment.

    The American ruling class vainly attempted to eliminate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with more than 100,000 Syngman Rhee troops directly equipped by them; vainly attempted to stain the various democratic achievements of the Korean people with their bloody claws, and weaken our people's will to resist the American policy of aggression. But the plan of the colonial rulers was thwarted by the decisive counter-offensive of our young People's Army. The American monopoly capitalists then directly threw their own troops into the Korean battlefield, exposing their ferocious aggressive face. Not only that, the American war-mongers even used the illegal decisions of the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly to legitimize the imperialists' act of aggression against Korea. However, these tricks did not save them. The Korean War over the past year has shown that all the plans of the American imperialists have been shamefully bankrupt. The Korean People's Army not only has the ability to resist the American and British aggressor troops, but also has the ability to inflict heavy blows on them. The war launched by the American ruling class in Korea has become a protracted war. The ferocious enemy has been hit by the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and its manpower and equipment have suffered and are still suffering huge losses.

    The bankruptcy of the plans of the American and British colonial rulers in Korea not only shows the strength of our People's Army, but also proves that the military science and ideological consciousness of the Korean People's Army has defeated the adventurous military dogma and misanthropic ideological consciousness of the American imperialists.

    When provoking the war, the American imperialist idealists underestimated the strength of the Korean People's Army, and at the same time failed to estimate our people's will and determination to defend freedom and national independence. The American rulers overestimated the strength of their own aggressor troops and were too confident in their own weapons, especially the air force.

    The Korean War shows that the Korean people will never forgive those enemies who plunder their freedom and independence, and will never bow to the colonial rulers. No threat or violence can weaken the Korean people's determination to victoriously defend their just cause. The entire Korean people rose up to support the army that has blood ties with them. The Korean people's struggle to defend freedom and independence has become a nationwide war against the American and British aggressors.

    In the process of our motherland's liberation war, it is an extremely exciting and significant event that the people of our great neighbor China launched a powerful mass patriotic movement of volunteering to aid the Korean People's Army and oppose the American armed interventionists in the autumn of 1950. The addition of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the ranks of the fighters defending our country has greatly enhanced our strength. This has great significance in the struggle against the aggressors.

    The People's Army and the entire Korean people deeply thank and love the fraternal Chinese people who sent their loyal sons and daughters—the People's Volunteers—to the Korean battlefield to support our country in the fight against the bloody American aggressors. There is a fraternal and close friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples forged in the long-term revolutionary struggle. This friendship has shown new strength due to the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the Korean people's liberation war against the common enemies of mankind—the American and British aggressors, who provoked the Korean War and attempted to expand it into a world war.

    With the fraternal assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the lofty goal of the Korean People's Army's struggle more powerfully inspired the combatants to establish meritorious deeds and carry out dedicated struggles. This is the mass heroism of the Korean People's Army. During the war, 201 combatants were awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and 112,757 soldiers were awarded medals and decorations. Our soldiers display bravery and boldness to a high degree every day. The Korean People's Army has glorious people's children led by the double hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea—Fang Hushan and Kim Ki-woo, such as Liu Jingshu, Jin Junyu, Jin Kiyu, Jin Fenghao, Li Xuewen, Luo Hongjun, Jin Changjie, Li Shunren and other heroes. Along with the names of our heroic combat heroes, there are thousands upon thousands of glorious names of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who display bravery and heroism on the front line and are loved and thanked by the entire Korean people.

    In order to understand how our glorious army has grown and learned in the process of fighting against the irreconcilable enemy, and what makes the soldiers have full confidence in defeating the aggressors despite knowing that there are still many difficulties ahead, it is necessary to briefly recall the beginning and the course of the war.

    Our leader—Supreme Commander General Kim Il-sung, in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, analyzed the domestic and international situation of our motherland in the war environment. He divided the great Korean People's Fatherland Liberation War into three basic stages. These three basic stages can be divided by time as follows: The first stage: from June 25, 1950, when the traitor Syngman Rhee bandit gang launched a surprise armed invasion against the northern half of our Republic, to mid-September 1950, including the operations of the People's Army Navy and Air Force during this period. The second stage: due to the superior strength of the American and British aggressor troops, especially the air force and navy, our People's Army made a temporary retreat. This stage lasted until late October 1950. The third stage: our heroic People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who provided fraternal assistance to the Korean people, together crushed the so-called November general offensive of the aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army, causing heavy losses to the enemy's manpower and equipment. This stage lasted from late October 1950 to the present.

    Each stage has its own characteristics.

    From the entire process of the war, each stage has common characteristics. This common characteristic is that our army is constantly growing stronger. Our army is tempered in each new campaign and battle, and its strategy and tactics, whether offensive or defensive, are enriched by new experience.

    The young commanding cadres have more richly learned the methods and ways of conducting modern warfare. The soldiers have further learned combat techniques in the process of conducting the war. In terms of the common characteristics of each stage of the Fatherland Liberation War, our army is advancing towards the road of constantly developing military art. At the same time, it has become a powerful and invincible army of our Democratic People's Republic of Korea. As for the third stage of the war, it must be pointed out that this stage is not like the first two stages—the People's Army fought the enemy alone, but fought with the continuous support of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer forces. We express our gratitude to the Chinese people.

    In the letter written by the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, representing the will of the entire Korean people, to the democratic parties of the People's Republic of China, the fraternal assistance given to us by the Chinese People's Volunteers was written as follows: "Under the command of the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army on our just front. The voice of the entire Chinese people supporting this just war not only resounded throughout Korea and China, but also throughout the world.

    The fraternal solidarity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, which we have forged closely in the just war, has not only become a solid fortress to defeat the common enemy of the two peoples and ensure the common victory of the two peoples, but also become a powerful driving force for safeguarding world peace and security and the happiness of all mankind."

    The course of the war clearly proves that the People's Army, which has flesh-and-blood ties with the people, is superior to the man-eating mercenary army in terms of morality, combat, and indomitable will to win. Our People's Army is waging a just liberation war for the freedom, independence and unity of the motherland, which inspires our soldiers to establish heroic feats for victory and strengthens their strength to fight the aggressors. The American and British aggressors and the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandits are waging an unjust war of aggression, such a war can never inspire the soldiers of the aggressive army.

    Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of the working people of the world, gave a uniquely correct scientific explanation of the reason why the Korean War was extremely unpopular among soldiers in the United States and Britain, he pointed out that even the soldiers of the American and British armies believed that the American imperialists' war against Korea was an unjust war.

    Marshal Stalin said: "Indeed, it is difficult to make the soldiers believe that China, which neither threatens Britain nor the United States and whose island of Taiwan is forcibly occupied by the United States, is the aggressor, while the United States, which has occupied Taiwan and pushed its troops to the border of China, is on the defensive. It is also difficult to make the soldiers believe that the United States has the right to defend the security of the United States on the territory of Korea and on the border of China, while China and Korea do not have the right to defend their security on their own territory and on their own border. Therefore, this war is unpopular among the soldiers of the United States and Britain." Marshal Stalin continued: "If the soldiers believe that the war they are forced to carry out is extremely unjust, if the soldiers therefore only perform their duties formally on the front line, neither believing in the justice of their mission nor having enthusiasm, then even the most experienced generals and officers will fail." Marshal Stalin's words have been fully proven by practical experience.

    The American government has replaced many generals because of its failure in the Korean War. Let's not talk about MacArthur's dismissal and the shameful end of some other American generals. However, the wrong conclusion that victory can be easily achieved without a tense struggle should not be drawn simply because many American generals have failed on the Korean battlefield. Do not forget that the enemy still has considerable strength. The American ruling class replaced the defeated generals and sent executioners like Ridgway to the Korean battlefield, and it will continue to send this kind of guy in the future. Waiting for these guys in front of them is the tragic fate of their predecessors. However, these guys are still struggling to death, arrogantly deceiving the soldiers to come to the battlefield.

    The bloody invasion of our country by the American imperialist aggressors has already gone through twelve months. In these twelve months, our people have carried out a heroic struggle to eliminate those aggressors who attempted to conquer Korea and strangle the freedom and independence of the Korean people. This year that our heroic people and the People's Army have fought intensely clearly proves that our People's Army, which has passed through the great combat school, has grown into a powerful armed force of our motherland.

    Our People's Army is loved and supported by people all over the world. Our army and the entire Korean people receive the unlimited moral support of the great Soviet Union, which liberated us from the oppression of Japanese slavery. We have the fraternal support of our fraternal neighboring country—powerful China and hundreds of millions of people in the socialist camp who love peace and democracy. All the kind people in the world who oppose war and love peace are on our side. All this is a powerful guarantee for us to completely eliminate the American imperialist aggressors who do not want to get out of Korea and their running dogs and win the final victory.

    But every member of our People's Army deeply remembers the teachings of their leader General Kim Il-sung: "Victory will not come by itself, only through a tenacious and indomitable struggle can victory be won."

    In the great Fatherland Liberation War, our soldiers and young commanders, in order to win the final victory, on the one hand, strive to improve their combat strength, and on the other hand, powerfully and ruthlessly strike the enemy.

    The officers and political workers of our army are working hard to hone their commanding art, organize the coordinated actions of various arms, and improve the ability of reconnaissance work.

    Our heroic male and female guerrillas comprehensively and successfully assist the People's Army and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers. Our logistics staff are working hard to continuously supply weapons, ammunition, and food and clothing to the troops.

    Our heroic People's Army and people, with the fraternal assistance of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers, under the leadership of our Korean national hero and people's leader General Kim Il-sung, will gloriously complete their lofty mission and completely eliminate the hateful aggressors and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, on our sacred land.

　　朝鲜人民军坚决保卫祖国的自由与荣誉
    朝鲜人民军总参谋长  南日
    一年前，美帝国主义强盗指使其走狗李承晚匪帮发动了朝鲜的内战。
    当我们人民军击退了由美国所直接武装起来的李承晚匪军的早有准备的进犯时，美帝国主义者就开始了对我国的公开武装干涉。美国侵略者的目的在于征服爱好自由的朝鲜人民、奴役朝鲜人民、并吞朝鲜领土，并使它变成进攻我们的伟大邻邦——苏联和中华人民共和国以及远东各国的桥头堡。这样就使我国濒于被奴役的危险境地了。
    我们人民军为了挽救这种危机，为了坚决保卫自己年青的民主主义人民共和国的自由和荣誉而勇敢奋起，全朝鲜人民也一致奋起，参加了反抗帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮的斗争。美国统治阶级要迅速而轻易地结束侵朝战争的企图破产了。给我国带来灾难和痛苦的强盗们遭受了并继续在遭受着决定性的抗击。处在这种局面，就不难了解朝鲜人民及其政府——人民共和国政府为了祖国的荣誉和利益而及时组织自己的武装力量，是多么有远见的事情。
    朝鲜人民军的历史，是和从一九四五年八月十五日日本帝国主义被英雄的苏军驱逐出我国疆土、朝鲜获得解放以后，我国所进行的伟大的各项民主改革分不开的。
    我们人民在劳动党的领导下建设了我们的民主国家。朝鲜人民为了保卫我们年青的国家的利益和新的民主和平建设而感到建立自己军队的必要，这是理所当然的。三年多以前，这种和我们人民有着血缘关系的朝鲜人民军就建立起来了。
    朝鲜人民所建立起来的军队，与资本主义国家的军队有着根本的区别。我们军队的第一个特点就在于它是属于人民的。
    在我国，人民和军队、将领及军官、下士以至战士是以共同的利益和目的、也就是以共同斗争的目的相结合起来的。他们彼此之间的关系就像一家人一样。人民军是由我们的人民装备起来的。我们的人民从建立人民军队的头一天起，就不怕武装的人。因为人民军队根本不像在日本或美国那些帝国主义国家里的雇佣兵一样，为了实现殖民地统治者、掠夺者、干涉者的意志而专把枪口瞄准劳动人民。在我国的北半部，武装的人正是人民的血肉——劳动人民的儿女。正因为如此，人民军从它最初建立时起，就受着人民普遍而积极的支持。
    人民军的第二个特点是它的爱国主义精神。人民军的战士们热爱埋葬着自己祖先遗骸和自己后代生活所系的祖国土地，热爱由于自由的劳动而更生的农田与业已成为人民财产的山林以及地下和海中的资源，热爱人民自己所建设起来的城市、农村、工厂、企业和为提高劳动人民的文化而建立起来的学校、医院、剧院和图书馆。
    对于我们的战士来说，最宝贵的东西莫过于祖国的利益和建设自己统一、独立、自由的祖国。这是他们所最渴望的事情。
    这种对祖国的真实的热爱，使得每个战斗员奋起参加斗争，使得他们能够克服各种困难和难关，促使他们发挥献身精神和群众的英雄主义精神，保障人民军能够执行其解放任务。
    我们人民军的第三个特点在于它对他国人民的尊重，和它所受到的高度的国际主义教育。
    我们军队的战士不知道种族差别，没有侵略的意图。朝鲜人民军坚决反对帝国主义关于种族的“优越”或“劣等”的理论。我们坚决拒斥美国反动派所极力鼓吹的某一种族应统治另一种族的谬论。国际主义精神贯彻到我们战士和指挥官的全部生活。人民军和英勇的中国人民志愿军之间的伟大友谊就可以证明这一点，这种友谊是用血结成的，它具有巨大的意义。为反对共同敌人美帝国主义而并肩作战的中国人民志愿军和我们人民军，在战场上和行军生活中，有着说不完的友爱互助的事迹。
    全世界各国千百万善良的人民都知道我们人民军及其战友——中国人民志愿军是为了自己祖国的自由、独立、统一和民主，为了自己的妻子、父母、兄弟和姊妹的幸福而英勇斗争着的战士。正因为如此，我们的战士和中国人民志愿军才受到了以伟大的苏联人民为首的各人民民主国家劳动人民及全体进步人类的支持、爱护和尊敬。
    去年秋天，在我们祖国解放战争最困难的时候，中国人民的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，为了帮助朝鲜人民与美国干涉者进行斗争而来到我国。这一正义行动表明了朝鲜人民和中国人民之间的伟大的永恒的友谊，和他们共同的崇高的国际主义任务。我们人民军为反抗美国干涉者而进行的斗争，是为了加强各国人民的和平安全与友谊互助。
    朝鲜人民军继承了自己祖国人民在数代中反抗压迫者的战斗传统。这种对和平破坏者的高度憎恨，和在与仇敌斗争中发挥献身性、创造性的传统，在反对日本及美国干涉者的英勇斗争中，更加显著了。在朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的领导下，曾经受过游击斗争的严重考验的我们英勇的游击队员们，成了人民军领导干部的坚强核心。他们有着人民战士的宝贵特点，即忍耐性、大胆性、机动战斗行动的经验、创造性、对自己人民和祖国的无限忠诚和对敌人的无限憎恨。
    他们受着人民和人民政府的信赖。不断地进行军事训练，提高理论与知识水平，教育新干部。
    人民军在劳动党和人民政府的领导下，从它成立之初即以很高的热诚积极进行政治教育，学习现代武器与军事科学。为了保卫为苏军武力所解放的朝鲜人民的祖国和他们的自由幸福，我们人民军的战斗员拿起了武器，以防备敌人的突然进犯。
    上述的训练，巩固了人民军对保卫祖国的神圣任务的认识。使他们在任何环境下也能给侵犯朝鲜人民自由荣誉的敌人以沉重的打击。
    美国统治阶级妄想以他们所直接装备起来的十万名以上的李承晚军队，来消灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国；妄想以他们的血爪沾污朝鲜人民的各种民主成果，削弱我们人民反对美国侵略政策的意志。但是殖民地统治者的这一计划，由于我们年青的人民军决定性的反攻而破产了。美国的独占资本家们继而又把他们自己的军队直接投入朝鲜战场，暴露了他们凶恶的侵略面目。不仅如此，美国战争贩子们竟利用安全理事会及联合国大会的非法决定，来使帝国主义者对朝鲜的侵略行为合法化。然而这些伎俩并没有能挽救他们。一年来的朝鲜战争，表明美帝国主义者的一切计划业已遭到可耻的破产。朝鲜人民军不仅具有能够抵抗美、英侵略军的能力，而且具有能够予以沉重打击的能力。美国统治阶级在朝鲜所发动的战争，已经形成长期战了。凶恶的敌人遭到人民军和中国人民志愿军的打击，其有生力量和装备业已遭受了并仍在遭受着巨大的损失。
    美、英殖民地统治者的计划在朝鲜的破产，不仅显示出我们人民军的力量，而且证明朝鲜人民军的军事科学及思想意识战胜了美帝国主义者冒险的军事教条及他们憎恨人类的思想意识。
    美帝国主义唯心论者在挑拨战争时，过低估计了朝鲜人民军的力量，同时未能估计到我们人民保卫自由和民族独立的斗争意志和决心。美国统治者们过高估计了他们自己的侵略军队的力量，过于相信了他们自己的武器，特别是空军。
    朝鲜战争说明朝鲜人民绝不能宽恕那些掠夺他们的自由和独立的敌人，绝不会向殖民地统治者低头屈服，任何威胁和暴行也不能削弱朝鲜人民要胜利地保卫自己的正义事业的决心。全朝鲜人民奋起支援与自己有着血缘关系的军队。朝鲜人民保卫自由和独立的斗争，已经成为全国性的反抗美、英侵略者的战争。
    在我们祖国解放战争的过程中，在一九五○年秋，我们伟大的邻邦——中国的人民展开了志愿援助朝鲜人民军、反对美国武装干涉者的强大的群众性爱国主义运动，这是令人极为兴奋和有重大意义的事件。在保卫我国的斗士的行列中，添上了中国人民志愿军，这就使我们的力量大为增强。这在反对侵略者的斗争中，有着巨大的意义。
    人民军和全朝鲜人民深切地感谢并热爱为反对血腥的美国侵略者而把自己忠实的儿女——人民志愿军派遣到朝鲜战场来支援我国的兄弟般的中国人民。朝鲜人民和中国人民之间有着在长期革命斗争中结成的兄弟般的亲密友谊。这种友谊由于中国人民志愿军的英勇斗争而表现了新的力量。中国人民志愿军参加了朝鲜人民反抗人类公敌——美、英侵略者的解放战争，美、英侵略者曾挑拨了朝鲜战争又企图使它扩大为世界战争。
    在中国人民志愿军兄弟般的援助下，朝鲜人民军所进行的崇高战斗的目的，更有力地鼓舞了战斗员们建立功勋，并进行献身性的斗争。这是朝鲜人民军的群众性英雄主义。在战争过程中，已有二百零一名战斗员荣膺朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄的称号，十一万二千七百五十七名战士荣膺勋章和奖章。我们的战士们每天都高度地发挥着勇敢性和大胆性。朝鲜人民军部队中有着以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国双重英雄——方虎山、金基雨为首的光荣的人民儿女，如柳京洙、金君钰、金基玉、金凤浩、李学文、罗弘俊、金昌杰、李顺任等英雄。和我们英勇的战斗英雄们的名字在一起的，还有数千数万的光荣的中国人民志愿军的名字。他们在前线发挥着勇敢性与英雄性，受着全朝鲜人民的爱护和感谢。
    为了解我们光荣的军队在与不共戴天的仇敌进行斗争的过程中，如何地成长、学习了什么、战士们明明知道自己的面前还有着许多困难而为什么还会有战胜侵略者的充分信心等问题，就需要简单地回忆一下战争的开始和进行的过程。
    我们的领袖——最高司令官金日成将军在劳动党中央委员会第三次常会的报告中分析了我们祖国在战争环境中所处的国内外形势。他把伟大的朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争划分为三个基本阶段。这三个基本阶段可以按时间划分如下：第一个阶段：从一九五○年六月二十五日卖国贼李承晚匪帮的反动武装对我共和国北半部发动意外进犯时起到一九五○年九月中旬止，包括人民军陆海军在该期间的作战。第二个阶段：由于美英侵略军的有生力量，特别是空军海军占了优势，我们人民军作了暂时的撤退。这一阶段是到一九五○年十月下旬为止。第三个阶段是：我们英勇的人民军和给予朝鲜人民以兄弟般援助的中国人民志愿军一起，粉碎侵略军和李承晚伪军的所谓十一月总攻势，使敌人的有生力量和装备遭到重大损失。这一阶段的时间是从一九五○年十月下旬起一直到现在。
    每一个阶段都有其特征。
    从战争的整个过程来说，各个阶段又有着共同的特征。这一共同的特征就是我们的军队不断地壮大。我们的军队在每次新的战役与战斗中受到锻炼，它的战略战术，不论是进攻的或防御的，都被新的经验更加丰富起来。
    年青的指挥干部们更丰富地学会了进行现代化战斗的方法与方式。战士们在进行战争的过程中，进一步学会了战斗技术。就祖国解放战争的各个阶段所具有的共同特征来说，我们的军队是在朝着不断地发展军事艺术的道路前进。同时，它已成为我们朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的强有力的不可被战胜的军队了。就战争第三阶段来说，必须指出：这一阶段并不是像头两个阶段那样——人民军单独和敌人进行战斗，而是在英雄的中国人民志愿军部队不断支援的条件下进行斗争。我们向中国人民表示感谢。
    在祖国统一民主主义战线代表全朝鲜人民的意志写给中华人民共和国各民主党派的信中，对于中国人民志愿军所给予我们的兄弟般的援助曾这样写道：“在朝鲜人民军最高司令部的指挥下，英勇的中国人民志愿军在我们的正义的前线与朝鲜人民军并肩作战了。声援这个正义战争的全体中国人民的声音，不仅响遍了朝鲜和中国，而且响遍了全世界。
    我们在正义战争中紧紧结成的中国人民和朝鲜人民兄弟般的团结，不仅成为击败两国人民的共同敌人、保证两国人民共同胜利的坚固堡垒，而且成为保卫世界和平与安全以及全人类幸福的强大推动力。”
    战争的过程明显地证明：与人民有着血肉关系的人民军，不论其道德、其战斗及其不屈不挠的必胜意志，都比吃人生番似的雇佣军优越。我们人民军是为了祖国的自由、独立与统一而进行正义的解放战争。它鼓舞着我们的战士为争取胜利而建立英雄的功勋，加强着他们和侵略者进行斗争的力量。美英侵略者与李承晚卖国匪帮则进行着非正义的侵略战争。这样的战争绝不能鼓舞侵略军队的士兵。
    全世界劳动人民的伟大导师斯大林大元帅曾就朝鲜战争在美国和英国的士兵中极端不得人心的原因，做了唯一的正确的科学的说明，他指出：就是美英军队的士兵也认为美帝国主义者对朝鲜的战争是非正义的战争。
    斯大林大元帅说：“的确，要使士兵们相信：既不威胁英国又不威胁美国而其台湾岛竟被美国强占了的中国是侵略者，而另一方面强占了台湾并将军队推向中国边境的美国倒是处于防御方面，这是很困难的。要使士兵们相信：美国有权利在朝鲜领土上和中国边境上保卫美国的安全，而中国和朝鲜却没有权利在它们自己的领土上和它们自己的国境上保卫它们的安全，这也是很困难的。因此，这个战争在美英士兵中是不得人心的。”斯大林大元帅继续说道：“如果士兵们认为强迫他们进行的战争是极端非正义的，如果士兵们因此而在前线上只是形式上执行职务，既不相信他们的使命合乎正义，也没有热情，那末就是最有经验的将领和军官也要失败的。”斯大林大元帅的话已被实际经验充分证明。
    美国政府由于自己在朝鲜战争中的失败，调换了许多将领。姑且不谈麦克阿瑟的被撤职及其他一些美国将领们的可耻下场了。然而，绝不能因为很多美国将领在朝鲜战场上遭到失败，就得出这样错误的结论，即没有紧张的斗争也会很容易地取得胜利。不要忘记，敌人还有着相当的力量。美国统治阶级调换败将，把刽子手李奇微之流派到朝鲜战场上来，它在今后还会继续派遣这一类的家伙来的。在这些家伙们的面前，等候着他们的是他们先辈们所遭到的悲惨命运。然而这些家伙们目前还在作垂死挣扎，狂妄地欺骗士兵们到战场上来。
    美帝国主义侵略者对我国所进行的血腥侵犯，业已经过了十二个月。在这十二个月中，我们人民为消灭那些妄图征服朝鲜扼杀朝鲜人民的自由与独立的侵略者，进行了英勇的斗争。我们英雄的人民与人民军紧张地进行战斗的这一年，清楚证明：我们经过伟大的战斗学校的人民军已经壮大成为我们祖国强大的武装力量了。
    我们人民军在国外受到全世界人民的热爱与声援。我们军队和全体朝鲜人民受到把我们从日本奴役制度的压迫下解放出来的伟大的苏联无限的道义支持。我们有兄弟般的邻邦国家——强大的中国以及数万万爱好和平、民主的社会主义阵营人民兄弟般的支持。全世界反对战争、热爱和平的善良的人们都站在我们这一方面。这一切就是我们彻底消灭不想滚出朝鲜的美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗、争取最后胜利的有力保障。
    但是我们人民军的每个成员都深深地铭记着自己的领袖金日成将军的教导：“胜利是不会自己到来的，只有经过顽强的不屈不挠的斗争，才能争取得胜利。”
    在伟大的祖国解放战争中，我们的战士与年青的指挥官为了争取最后的胜利，一方面努力提高自己的战斗力量，另一方面在有力而无情地打击着敌人。
    我们军队的军官与政治工作人员们，为锻炼指挥艺术、组织各兵种的协同动作、提高侦察工作的能力而努力着。
    我们英勇的男女游击队员全面而有成就地协助着人民军与英勇的中国人民志愿军。我们的后方工作人员为了向部队不断地供给武器、弹药及粮食衣服而努力着。
    我们英勇的人民军和人民在光荣的中国人民志愿军兄弟般的援助下，在我们朝鲜民族英雄、人民领袖金日成将军的领导下，将会光荣地完成自己崇高的使命，在我们神圣的国土上，把可恨的侵略者与其走狗李承晚匪帮消灭干净。
