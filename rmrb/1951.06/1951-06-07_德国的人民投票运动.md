　　The People's Referendum Movement in Germany
    Xinhua News Agency Berlin Correspondent Lin Ning
    The people's referendum movement against West German remilitarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951 is sweeping across Germany like an unstoppable tide. This is an unprecedentedly large-scale mass movement of patriotic people in Germany since the Second World War. German Communist Party member of parliament, Reitz, pointed out in the Bonn parliament: "Since 1945, no political issue has mobilized the entire German people like this issue of opposing West German remilitarization."
    The people's referendum movement against West German remilitarization and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in 1951 is being carried out in the context of West Germany's accelerating remilitarization. Recently, the "Schuman Plan" to arm West Germany has been signed in Paris; in the Ruhr and Rhine regions of West Germany, more than 1,500 factories are already engaged in war production; West German states have been divided into military zones; the headquarters of the future West German mercenary army, the so-called "Border Police Command," has been established; and the number of US and British occupation troops stationed in West Germany has been increasing. All these actions are accelerating West German remilitarization. Therefore, the unfolding of the German people's referendum movement is a powerful exposure and heavy blow to the series of steps taken by US imperialism to intensify the arming of West Germany in preparation for war.
    This referendum was proposed by more than 1,700 representatives of all strata of West German people at the congress against West German remilitarization held in Essen in January this year. The Essen Congress passed a declaration addressed to the Bonn "government," demanding a referendum on the question of "Are you against remilitarization and in favor of concluding a peace treaty with Germany in 1951?" The characteristic of this congress was the organization of many working committees to prepare for in-depth work among all strata of the people. The spirit of the congress was given special attention and praise at the Berlin meeting of the World Peace Council.
    In response to the call of the Essen Congress, committees against remilitarization were established one after another in the major ports and industrial cities of West Germany, such as Hamburg, Bremen, Kiel, Essen, Dusseldorf, and Stuttgart, as well as in other places, during February and March, and demanded a referendum.
    However, the Essen Congress's declaration demanding a referendum was unreasonably rejected by the Bonn "government." This rejection shows that the Bonn "government" will continue to pursue an anti-people and treasonous policy of preparing for war.
    Under these circumstances, on April 14, the West German people established the Central Committee for the People's Referendum against Remilitarization in Essen to lead the people's referendum throughout West Germany as a response to the Bonn "government." The establishment of the Central Committee unified and strengthened the movement of the people in various parts of West Germany against remilitarization, making them converge into a main stream. After the establishment of the Central Committee, the committees against remilitarization in various parts of West Germany were successively reorganized into preparatory committees for the people's referendum. Within a week, forty-five preparatory committees were established in the state of Württemberg-Baden, eleven in Essen, and seventy-five in West Berlin.
    The Western authorities and the Bonn "government," who are actively engaged in war preparations, appeared very embarrassed in the face of the huge people's referendum movement. The Bonn "government" hastily issued an "order" in late April "prohibiting" the holding of a referendum, and took suppressive measures such as arrests, persecutions, sealing up newspapers, confiscating leaflets, and dispersing gatherings, in an attempt to obstruct the people's referendum. However, the West German people did not retreat because of the Bonn government's "ban" and various suppression measures. They overcame various difficulties and used various open and secret methods to insist on holding the people's referendum in factories, enterprises, residential areas, rural areas, and schools. Democratic and progressive newspapers published daily the figures of the results of the people's referendum in a factory, a street, or even an apartment building. The preliminary results of the people's referendum throughout West Germany show that 92.8 percent of the West German people who participated in the vote are against remilitarization and demand the conclusion of a peace treaty in 1951.
    In sharp contrast to the Bonn "government's" suppression, the government of the German Democratic Republic gave the most resolute support to holding the people's referendum. The People's Chamber of the Democratic Republic approved the government's decision on May 9, accepted the request of the Central Committee for the People's Referendum in West Germany, and decided to hold a people's referendum throughout the Republic from June 3 to 5. On May 10, a propaganda campaign to prepare for the people's referendum was launched simultaneously in seventeen major cities and ten major industrial sectors in the Republic. Deputy Prime Ministers Nuschke and Loch, as well as various ministers, personally went to various parts of the Republic to give speeches. President Pieck also delivered a radio address to the nation on May 15, explaining the great significance of the people's referendum.
    The working people of the German Democratic Republic warmly welcomed the holding of the people's referendum. Two thousand workers from the Leipzig Transportation Factory volunteered to join volunteer work teams as an expression of support for holding the people's referendum. The 7,200 workers and technicians of the Stahlwerk Thale factory in Saxony-Anhalt guaranteed to complete the plan to produce 14,000 tons of steel for peaceful purposes in May to welcome the people's referendum movement in early June.
    The German people's referendum movement is now continuing to unfold and deepen throughout Germany. Through this great movement, the German people will increasingly clearly recognize that only a truly democratic, peace-loving, and unified Germany can lead the German nation and the German people to a bright and happy future.

### 德国的人民投票运动

　　德国的人民投票运动
    新华社驻柏林记者  林宁
    反对西德重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年缔结对德和约的人民投票运动，正像不可遏止的潮水一样，在整个德国泛滥着。这是二次大战以后在德国所进行的规模空前巨大的爱国人民的群众运动。德国共产党议员雷熙曾在波恩议会中指出：“自从一九四五年以来，没有任何一个政治问题，像这个反对西德重新军国主义化的问题一样，使得整个德国的人民都行动了起来。”
    反对西德重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年内缔结对德和约的人民投票运动，是在西德加紧重新军国主义化的情况下进行的。最近时期，武装西德的“舒曼计划”已在巴黎签字；在西德的鲁尔与莱因地区，已经有一千五百多家工厂从事战争生产；西德各州都已划分为军事区域；未来的西德雇佣军的司令部，所谓“边境警察指挥部”，已经成立；驻扎在西德的美英占领军已经愈来愈多。所有这些行动都加速着西德的重新军国主义化。因此，德国人民投票运动的展开，对于美帝国主义所进行的这一连串加紧武装西德以准备战争的步骤，就是一个有力的揭发和沉重的打击。
    这次人民投票，是西德各阶层人民的代表一千七百余人在今年一月于埃森举行的反对西德重新军国主义化代表大会上提出的。埃森大会曾通过了送致波恩“政府”的宣言一件，要求就“你反对重新军国主义化和赞成在一九五一年缔结对德和约吗？”这一问题举行人民投票。这次大会的特点是组织了许多工作委员会，准备深入到各阶层人民中去进行工作。大会的精神，在世界和平理事会柏林会议上，受到了特别的重视和赞扬。
    为了响应埃森大会的号召，在西德的汉堡、不来梅、基尔、埃森、杜塞尔多夫和斯图加特等大港口和工业城市中以及其他各地，二、三月份内纷纷成立了反对重新军国主义化的委员会，并要求举行人民投票。
    但是，埃森大会要求举行人民投票的宣言，遭到了波恩“政府”的无理拒绝。这种拒绝说明了波恩“政府”要继续奉行反人民的卖国备战政策。
    在这种情况之下，四月十四日，西德人民就在埃森成立了反对重新军国主义化的人民投票中央委员会，以领导在西德全境举行的人民投票，作为对波恩“政府”的回答。人民投票中央委员会的成立，统一并且加强了西德各地人民反对重新军国主义化的运动，使它们汇成了一支主流。中央委员会成立以后，西德各地的反对重新军国主义化委员会都相继改组成为人民投票筹备委员会。在一个星期之中，瓦登堡—巴登州就成立了四十五个筹备委员会，埃森成立了十一个，西柏林成立了七十五个。
    积极进行备战活动的西方当局和波恩“政府”，在巨大的人民投票运动面前显得很狼狈。波恩“政府”慌忙于四月下旬下令“禁止”举行人民投票，并采取了逮捕、迫害、查封报纸、没收传单、驱散集会等镇压手段，企图阻挠人民投票。可是，西德人民并没有因为波恩政府的“禁令”和各种镇压措施而有所退缩，他们冲破各种困难，利用各种公开的和秘密的方式，在各工厂、企业、居民区、农村和学校中，坚持举行人民投票。民主与进步的报纸天天刊载着一个厂、一条街以至一个公寓内人民投票结果的数字。整个西德人民投票的初步结果表明：在参加投票的西德人民中，有百分之九十二点八的人们反对重新军国主义化和要求在一九五一年内缔结和约。
    与波恩“政府”的镇压恰巧相反，德意志民主共和国政府对于举行人民投票却给予了最坚决的支持。民主共和国人民议会于五月九日批准了政府的决定，接受了西德人民投票中央委员会的请求，定于六月三日至五日在共和国全境举行人民投票。五月十日，在共和国境内十七个大城市和十大企业部门中同时展开了筹备人民投票的宣传运动。副总理努舍克、洛赫以及各部长，都曾亲自到共和国各地去演讲。皮克总统并于五月十五日向全国发表广播演讲，说明人民投票的重大意义。
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民热烈欢迎人民投票的举行。来比锡运输工厂有两千个工人志愿参加义务工作队，作为拥护举行人民投票的表示。萨克森——安哈尔特州塔雷城钢铁工厂的七千二百名工人与技师，保证在五月份内完成生产一万四千吨用于和平事业的钢的计划，来迎接六月初的人民投票运动。
    德国人民的投票运动现在正在全德继续展开和深入中。通过这次伟大的运动，德国人民将日益清楚地认识到，必须有一个真正民主的、爱好和平的、统一的德国，才能使德国民族和德国人民走上光明和幸福的前途。
