　　　　Chinese Edition, No. 91, Published
    "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, No. 91, has been published.
    This issue publishes an editorial titled "Ideological Education and Revolutionary Training of Communists," and includes an article by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Romanian Communist Party, titled "The 30th Anniversary of the Party." This article narrates the 30-year history of struggle of the Romanian Communist Party, pointing out that the party became strong and capable of undertaking the work of building socialism because it eliminated reformism and opportunism, and implemented political, organizational, and ideological unity. Romanian Workers' Party Secretary Gheorghe Stoica published an article "The Leading Force in the People's Democratic System," discussing how the party realizes its leading role in the people's democratic system through close contact with the broad masses of the people.
    This issue publishes French Communist Party Secretary Lecœur's "The Tasks of French Communists in the Movement to Collect Signatures for the Peace Pact." Lecœur said: Every action—from shouting slogans against war to winning victories for economic demands—is inseparable from the cause of peace.
    This issue also publishes FDJ Chairman Erich Honecker's "West German Youth Fight Against Remilitarization," and Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Presidium member Kohút's "The Tito Clique Sells Yugoslavia's Independence to Imperialists," and other articles.
