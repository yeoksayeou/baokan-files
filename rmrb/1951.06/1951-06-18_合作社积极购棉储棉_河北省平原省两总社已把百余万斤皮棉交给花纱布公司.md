After the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued instructions on cotton purchasing and storing, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives also issued a call to cooperative members and cotton farmers to carry out a patriotic cotton selling and storing competition. As of June 15, the Central South Cooperative Affairs Administration had agreed with the Central South District Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation to purchase and store 40,000 dan of raw cotton on their behalf during June, July, and August. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative has handed over 938,900 jin of ginned cotton purchased by itself, and the Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative has handed over 89,000 jin of ginned cotton purchased by itself, to the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation for use by spinning mills. The Qidong Cooperative in northern Jiangsu can purchase 100 dan of cotton every day. Lou Tang in Jiading County, southern Jiangsu, originally estimated that it could collect 500 dan of seed cotton, but it has now received 1,008 dan. In Nanhui County, from May 27 to June 5, nine cooperatives stored 302 dan of seed cotton and purchased 1,293 dan of seed cotton.

In order to encourage members and cotton farmers to store cotton in cooperatives, the Hebei Provincial Cooperative also agreed on the following storage methods with the China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation: When cotton farmers store cotton in the cooperative, after grading and weighing, a receipt is issued, clearly stating the grade, ginning outturn (i.e., the ratio of the weight of cotton after ginning to the weight before ginning. In the news item titled "Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Specifically Arranges Cotton Purchasing and Storing Work" on page 2 of this newspaper on June 13, "ginning outturn rate" was mistakenly written as "饻分率," which should be corrected.), quantity, current listed price, and settlement conditions (monthly interest of 1.2%, principal and value guaranteed, prices only rise and do not fall, and at the time of settlement, the higher of the listed price or the market price is used. Lump-sum or installment payments, goods or cash, are all at the voluntary choice of the masses). The cooperative also combines with various specialized companies to establish continuous business operations to supply cotton farmers who need real goods.

　　合作社积极购棉储棉        
    河北省平原省两总社已把百余万斤皮棉交给花纱布公司
    中央人民政府政务院发布关于购棉储棉工作的指示后，全国合作总社也向合作社社员和棉农发出开展爱国主义售棉存棉竞赛的号召。截至六月十五日，中南合作事业管理局已与中南区花纱布公司商妥在六、七、八三个月内代购代存原棉四万担。河北省总社自己收购的皮棉九三八九○○斤、平原省总社自己收购的皮棉八九○○○斤，均已交给花纱布公司以供纱厂需用。苏北启东合作社，每天可购到棉花一百担。苏南嘉定县娄塘原估计能收籽棉五百担，现已收到一千零八担。南汇县自五月二十七日到六月五日，九个社储籽棉三百零二担，购籽棉一千二百九十三担。
    为了鼓励社员及棉农将棉花储存到合作社，河北省总社并与花纱布公司商定了以下储存办法：棉农到社存棉时，经过评级过秤，开给收据，写清等级、衣分、（即棉花轧去棉籽后与轧去棉籽前的重量的比率。本报六月十三日第二版题为《平原省人民政府具体布置购棉储棉工作》的消息中将“衣分率”误为“饻分率”，应予更正。）数量、当时牌价、结算条件（月息一分二厘，保本保值，价格听涨不听落，结算时牌价高按牌价，市价高按市价。整付零付，要物要款，悉听群众自愿）。合作社并结合各专业公司，建立连环业务，以供给需要实物的棉农。
