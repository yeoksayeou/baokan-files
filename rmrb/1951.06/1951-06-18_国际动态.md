            France's Best-Selling Newspaper
    The French Communist Party's "l'Humanité Hebdo" sold 804,000 copies on June 10th. Although the newspaper relies solely on retail sales for distribution, it is now the best-selling newspaper in the country.
            A Glorious Task
    A signature campaign demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact has begun in Thailand. The Thailand Peace Committee published an open letter to the people of the nation, announcing the official commencement of the peace pact declaration signature campaign on June 2nd. The committee called on all peace-loving people in Thailand to participate in the signature drive, and suggested that domestic peace-loving organizations actively participate in this glorious task.
            Wall Street Tycoons' "Interest"
    Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen, upon returning from the United States, announced plans for extensive industrial construction in northern Norway. The head of the U.S. Marshall Plan execution agency in Norway, Gross, also told reporters that Norway had hope of receiving American aid because the Marshall Plan organization was generally interested in the natural resources of northern Norway.
    While Wall Street tycoons' "interests" may be broad, they should be wary of disappointing the people of Norway!

            华尔街大亨的“兴趣”
    刚从美国回国的挪威总理基哈德森，宣布计划在挪威北部进行广泛的工业建设。美国驻挪威的马歇尔计划执行机关的头目格罗斯也对记者说：挪威有得到美国援助的希望，因为马歇尔计划组织对挪威北部的天然富源一般地感到兴趣。
    华尔街大亨的“兴趣”虽然很广，就是要当心挪威的人民会使它们扫兴！
