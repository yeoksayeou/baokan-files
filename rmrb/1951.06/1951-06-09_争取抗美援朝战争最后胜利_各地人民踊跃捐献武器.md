    The people of Hebei Province are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea by launching a campaign to donate weapons.

Workers in Tangshan proposed: to dig one more pick of coal, produce one more ton of steel, and generate one more kilowatt-hour of electricity, and donate all the extra wages earned to buy airplanes and cannons. After the resolution of the Tongxian Special District Representative Conference to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to donate a "Tongxian" airplane was broadcast, many people called the conference to report the amount they wanted to donate. Yidehao and 41 other businesses donated 66.22 million yuan on the same day.
