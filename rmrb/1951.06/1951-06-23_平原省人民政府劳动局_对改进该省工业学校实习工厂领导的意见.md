    Labor Bureau of the People's Government of Pingyuan Province
    Opinions on Improving the Leadership of the Industrial School's Practice Factory in the Province
    Since the Worker's Daily on March 6, the People's Daily on March 12, and the Pingyuan Daily made criticisms of the management style of the Pingyuan Industrial School's practice factory and the technician Zhang Shouyi, the factory has conducted a review. In order to properly resolve the issue, our bureau instructed the Xinxiang Special District Labor Section and the Jixian Labor Unit to conduct a thorough inspection of the factory.
    The main reason for the factory's poor production is the lack of unity among employees and the lack of coordination between the administrative side and the trade union. The administrative side lacks a clear view of relying on workers to improve production, believing that the factory is an affiliated institution of the school and not an enterprise, and failing to reward production models and activists in a timely manner. On the trade union side (Jixian County Trade Union), there is also a failure to properly educate workers to abide by labor discipline and establish a sense of ownership in their labor; a failure to proactively unite staff and technical personnel and help the administrative side overcome difficulties in production; instead, an attitude of opposition to the administrative side is adopted, which affects the improvement of production and technology.
    Based on the above situation and the current existing problems, we put forward the following opinions:
    (1) Administrative leaders should establish a clear view of relying on the working class to develop production, implement democratic management, and change the bureaucratic style of leadership. They should gradually improve the living and welfare facilities of workers and staff according to the actual situation, further stimulate the production enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and correct the serious phenomenon of solely relying on technicians, neglecting the unity of workers and technical personnel, and being divorced from the masses.
    (2) Strengthen trade union work and educate all workers and staff to overcome difficulties and develop production. It must be clearly recognized that only by developing production can the problems of workers be properly resolved. One-sidedly emphasizing workers' welfare not only affects production, but also fails to solve the welfare problem, and easily creates uncoordinated relations between administration and the trade union.
    (3) Zhang Shouyi's thoughts and style are tainted with serious bad habits from the old society. In addition to strengthening education and giving him punishment, the administrative leaders should also conduct a profound review and apologize to the workers.

### 平原省人民政府劳动局  对改进该省工业学校实习工厂领导的意见

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    平原省人民政府劳动局
    对改进该省工业学校实习工厂领导的意见
    自三月六日工人日报、三月十二日人民日报及平原日报对平原工业学校实习工厂管理作风及技师张守义提出批评后，该厂曾进行了检讨。我局为了使问题求得适当的解决，责成新乡专署劳动科及汲县劳动股，对该厂进行彻底检查。
    该厂生产搞不好，主要的原因，是职工不团结，行政方面和工会的关系不协调。行政方面缺乏明确的依靠工人搞好生产的观点，认为该厂是学校附属机构，不是企业，对生产模范与积极分子，不能及时奖励。在工会方面（汲县县工会），也不能很好地教育工人遵守劳动纪律，树立主人翁的劳动态度；不能主动的团结职员和技术人员，帮助行政方面克服生产中的困难；只是采取和行政方面对立的态度，以致影响了生产与技术的提高。
    根据以上情况和当前存在的问题，我们提出以下几点意见：
    （一）行政领导干部应树立明确依靠工人阶级发展生产的观点，实行民主管理，转变领导上的官僚主义作风。应根据实际情况逐步地改善工人职员的生活和福利设施，进一步启发工人群众的生产积极性和创造性，纠正单纯依靠技师、忽视工人与技术人员的团结，及脱离群众的严重现象。
    （二）加强工会工作，教育全体工人职员，克服困难发展生产。要明确地认识：只有发展生产，工人的问题才有可能得到适当的解决。片面地强调工人福利，不但影响生产，而且福利问题也解决不了，并易造成行政和工会关系不协调的现象。
    （三）张守义在思想上、作风上薰染着严重的旧社会的不良习气，行政领导方面除对他加强教育和给予处分外，并应作深刻的检查，向工人道歉。
