　　Strengthening the Ideological Nature of Newspaper Work
    Newspapers should frequently publish editorials based on their understanding of the actual situation, publishing commentaries on various work and ideological issues, and propaganda articles on Marxism-Leninism, in order to elucidate every phenomenon encountered by the masses in the great historical struggle. Every article, every piece of news, every picture published in the newspaper should also reflect its profound ideological content. Some people see strengthening the ideological nature of newspaper propaganda as simply strengthening commentary work, thinking that this would inevitably lead to newspapers publishing boring long-winded articles. This is incorrect. Some people see strengthening the ideological nature of newspaper propaganda as only a problem for some large newspapers and not all newspapers, as if popularization and strengthening ideology are mutually exclusive. This view is also incorrect. Every line published in the newspaper should be ideological. Every newspaper, whether a large newspaper or a popular small newspaper, every editorial staff member, whether a commentary writer or other writer, should take strengthening the ideological nature of the newspaper as their constant task and continuous goal.
    One of the main requirements for the ideological nature of newspaper propaganda is that newspapers should be good at conducting propaganda based on the actual ideological situation of the masses, solving the ideological problems of the masses in propaganda, and improving the level of understanding of the masses, so as to lead the masses forward. Our newspapers are guides to practical work, and an important weapon for the Party and the government or other work organs to realize leadership. Therefore, it must "be good at persuading the masses to believe that the Party's policies are correct, propose and implement slogans that can lead the masses to the Party's position and make it easy for them to recognize the correctness of the Party's policies based on their own experience, and raise the masses to the Party's level of awareness, so as to ensure that they have the support of the masses and that the masses have the determination to fight." (Stalin's words). When the ideological level of the masses has not yet risen to the level of the Party, they will have various questions and concerns in their thinking about the various policies and work of the country. Explaining these questions, eliminating these concerns, and proving them with various factual materials, this is the task of the newspaper. For example, between October and December of last year, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend the country became the solemn task of the people of the whole country, but at that time many people had not yet ideologically recognized the correctness of this slogan, and there were still many concerns, such as fearing to "get burned," advocating "it is best to build behind closed doors," and so on. In this situation, the newspaper wrote articles to dispel these concerns, criticized some wrong ideas, and published many factual materials so that the masses could recognize the necessity of doing so based on their own experience. This is a manifestation of the ideological nature of newspaper work, and articles, news, pictures, and other materials that meet the above requirements are materials with a certain ideological nature.
    But just doing this is not enough. The newspaper is a political tool, and the fundamental purpose of newspaper propaganda is to improve the political awareness of the people through various practical works and concrete facts, and to guide the masses' thinking towards great goals, towards the victory of our country's New Democratic construction and the bright future of socialism. Without this political purpose, there can be no true height of ideology. Our country is carrying out huge transformation and construction work, and each of these works, when viewed separately, is very practical. Putting them together as a whole concretely shows the New Democratic present and the great and bright socialist future of our country; each practical work occupies a certain position in the overall New Democratic construction and socialist future. The newspaper should be good at expressing these, thereby conducting the most powerful propaganda. Our newspapers should frequently publicize various methods, experiences, and creations generated in various practical works, but if we only do these practical propaganda and do not point out their political significance, then we have castrated the important content that should be publicized, there is no ideological nature, and there is a risk of causing the masses to lose their direction in their thinking. Therefore, the newspaper's propaganda on various practical works must be good at pointing out the close relationship between every screw produced by workers at the lathe, every grain of food and every cotton plant sown by farmers on the land, every yuan of tax paid by industrialists and businessmen, and so on, and our country's current construction and future happiness, so that the political and ideological content of these works is revealed. Only in this way can the people gain a deep and constantly acting impetus in promoting these works, and thereby improve their political awareness and cultivate their consciousness of building a new democratic society and laying the foundation for a socialist future.
    In this regard, our newspaper work still has great shortcomings. We often indulge in the routine propaganda of various practical works and neglect to explain the position of these works in the entire revolutionary cause, and neglect to elucidate the political significance of this work. This is the most important manifestation of the current lack of ideological nature of newspaper propaganda. All newspapers have published many news and articles about the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but for a long time very few have been seen to educate the people through these materials to specifically understand the nature of the people's regime, and very few works have implemented the ideological education of the people's democratic dictatorship in the reports. Are these ideas difficult for the masses to understand? It is completely impossible to say that. In the accusation meeting held in Beijing, didn't an ordinary old lady say to the special agent bully the sharp and clear sentence "At that time, the government court was yours, I could not seek justice, and now the people's government is ours"? Based on this understanding obtained by the people from their own experience, the basic content of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state can be further explained. Then, is it not very inappropriate for us to have neglected for a long time to use the comments and reports on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to specifically carry out the education of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship? The June 1st People's Daily editorial "Responding to the Call of the State to Launch a Cotton Sales and Storage Movement" pointed out: "'To get rich, grow cotton,' this sentence only said one side of the matter; the truth and the basic side is that to protect the country is to get rich," This reason is extremely simple, but isn't the propaganda about growing cotton in our newspapers often carried out under the slogan of "to get rich grow cotton"? To expand a bit, isn't the propaganda on "production to get rich" in the newspaper often proceeding purely from the immediate interests of the farmers, without being linked to the interests of national construction, without pointing out the development prospects of agricultural production? Isn't the propaganda on industrial and agricultural production often filled with this kind of pure economic agitation?
    This is a problem that deserves our serious attention. Glebnev pointed out in "On Newspaper Review": "The newspaper is a political organ. In the struggle to implement the economic plan, in the reports of the work of the Party, the Soviet, and the economic organizations, it must show a high degree of Bolshevik ideology, principles, and keenness. Politics and business are inseparable. If the newspaper publishes news of spring plowing, autumn harvest, and grain delivery, then it must learn to report on the specific tasks of the collective farm from a political standpoint when conducting these movements, and link the tasks of the district with the tasks of the whole country. For the practical business work of collective farms, tractor stations, and state-owned farms, the newspaper must evaluate it not from the official, but from the political and party point of view." ("How to Lead the Party Newspaper" pp. 58-59) Failing to pay constant attention to this fundamental point has resulted in the weak ideological consequences of our newspaper. This issue must be given serious attention, and every writing staff member must work hard to seek continuous improvement.
    In the past six months, the major newspapers in various places have generally paid attention to the issue of strengthening the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and many newspapers have strengthened commentary work. This is very important. Improvements in these areas have already increased the ideology of our newspapers by one step. But just paying attention to this aspect is not enough. We must pay attention to the ideological nature of every news story and communication in the newspaper, and be good at reporting various practical works from a political and party standpoint, pointing out the political content of this work. Oppose the tendency to ignore politics in the reports of practical work. Using concrete examples to illustrate what is the political and party standpoint in the reporting of various phenomena and various practical works is an important key to strengthening the ideology of the newspaper. The newspaper editorial department should pay constant attention to this issue, and lead the editorial department staff to conduct constant study and improvement in this area.

### 加强报纸工作的思想性

　　加强报纸工作的思想性
    报纸应该根据他们对于实际情况的了解经常发表社论，发表关于各种工作和思想问题的评论和关于马克思列宁主义的宣传论文，以阐明人民群众在伟大历史斗争中所遇到的每一种现象。在报纸上发表的每一篇文章，每一则新闻，每一幅图画，也同样应该表现它的深刻的思想内容。有些人把加强报纸宣传的思想性单纯地看成加强评论工作，以为这样一来，报纸就非该发表令人厌倦的长篇大论不可，这是不对的。有些人把加强报纸宣传的思想性看成只是某些大型报纸而不是一切报纸的问题，似乎通俗化与加强思想性是对立的这种看法，也是不对的。应该使发表在报纸上的每一行都具有思想性。每一种报纸无论是大型报纸或者通俗的小型报纸，每一个编写工作人员无论是评论作者还是其他作者，都应该把加强报纸的思想性作为自己经常的任务和不断努力的目标。
    报纸宣传的思想性的主要要求之一，是报纸应该善于根据群众的实际思想情况进行宣传，在宣传中解决群众的思想问题，提高群众的认识水平，以便领导群众前进。我们的报纸是指导实际工作的，是党和政府或其他工作机关用以实现领导的重要武器，因此它必须“善于说服群众来相信党的政策正确，提出并实行一些能把群众引到党的立场上来，并使他们易于根据本身经验认识党政策正确的口号，把群众提高到党的觉悟水准，这样来保证得到群众的拥护，并使群众有进行决斗的决心。”（斯大林语）在群众的思想水平还没有提高到党的水准的时候，他们对国家的各项政策和工作，是会在思想上有各种问题、各种顾虑的。解释这些问题，消除这些顾虑，用各种事实材料来证明它，这就是报纸的任务。例如在去年十月至十二月间，抗美援朝保家卫国成了全国人民的庄严的任务，但当时有许多人还没有从思想上认识这个口号的正确性，还存在着许多顾虑，例如怕“惹火烧身”，主张“最好关门建设”等等。在这种情形之下，报纸写了文章解除了这些顾虑，批判了一些错误的思想，发表许多事实材料，以便群众能根据他本身的经验来认识这样做的必要性，这就是报纸工作的思想性的一种表现，适合以上这些要求的文章、新闻、图画等材料，就是有一定的思想性的材料。
    但仅仅这样做了还是不够的。报纸是一种政治的工具，报纸宣传的根本目的是通过种种实际工作、种种具体事实来提高人民群众的政治觉悟，引导群众思想走向伟大的目标，走向我们国家新民主主义建设的胜利和社会主义的光辉前途。脱离了这种政治目的，就不能有真正的高度的思想性。我们的国家正在进行着巨大的改造和建设的工作，这种种工作的每一件分开来看都带有很大的实际性。把它们合为一个总体，就具体地显现出来我们国家的新民主主义的今天和伟大而光辉的社会主义的明天；每一种实际工作在总的新民主主义建设和社会主义前途中都占有其一定的位置，报纸应该善于把这些表现出来，以此进行最有力的宣传。我们的报纸要经常宣传产生在各种实际工作中的种种办法、种种经验、种种创造，但如果我们仅仅做了这些实际性的宣传，而没有指明其政治意义，那就阉割了应该加以宣传的重要内容，就没有思想性，就有使群众在思想上失去方向的危险。因此，报纸对于各种实际工作的宣传，必须善于指明工人在车床边所生产的每个螺丝钉，农民在土地上所播种的每一颗粮食、每一株棉花，工商业者所缴纳的每一元税款等等，与我们国家的当前建设和未来幸福之间存在着的密切的关系，使这些工作的政治思想内容显露出来。只有这样，才能使人民在推进这些工作中获得深厚而又经常起作用的动力，并由此提高他们的政治觉悟，培养他们建设新民主主义社会和奠定社会主义前途的自觉心。
    在这一点上，我们的报纸工作还有着很大的缺陷。我们常常沉溺于各种实际工作的事务性的宣传而忽略了说明这些工作在整个革命事业中所占有的地位，忽略了对这种工作的政治意义的阐明。这是目前报纸宣传思想性不强的最主要的表现。所有的报纸都发表了许多关于宣传镇压反革命的新闻和文章，但是曾在很长的时间中极少看到通过这些材料教育人民具体地认识人民政权的性质，也极少在报道中贯彻人民民主专政的思想教育的作品。难道这些思想是群众难于理解的么？完全不能这样说。北京举行的控诉会中，不是有一个普通的老大娘向特务恶霸说出“那时政府法院是你们的，我无法伸冤，现在人民政府是我们的了”这样尖锐而明确的语句么？根据人民由本身经验所得到的这种认识，就可以进一步阐明马克思列宁主义的国家论的基本内容。那么，我们长期地忽略了用关于镇压反革命的评论和报道，具体进行巩固人民民主专政的教育，不是很不应该的么？六月一日人民日报社论《响应国家号召开展售棉储棉运动》一文中指出：“‘要发家，种棉花’，这句话仅仅说了事情的一面；真理和基本的一面，则是保国才能发家”，这道理原极平易，但是我们报纸上关于种棉花的宣传岂不正时常是在“要发家种棉花”的口号下进行的么？扩大一些说，报纸上关于“生产发家”的宣传，岂不也常是单纯从农民的眼前利益出发，而没有联系到国家建设的利益，没有指明农业生产的发展前途么？关于工农业生产的宣传，岂不都常充满了这种性质的单纯经济鼓动么？
    这是一个值得引起我们严重注意的问题。葛烈勃涅夫在《论报刊述评》一文中指出：“报纸是政治的机关。在为执行经济计划的斗争中，在党、苏维埃、经济组织的工作的报道中，它必须表现高度的布尔什维克的思想性、原则性和敏锐性。政治与业务是分不开的。假使报纸在刊载春耕、秋收、缴粮的消息，那么它在进行这些运动时，就必须学会从政治的立场报道集体农庄的具体任务，把区的任务和全国的任务联系起来。对于集体农场、拖拉机站和国营农场的实际业务工作，报纸必须不是从官厅的，而是从政治的、党的观点来评价。”（《怎样领导党报》五八——五九页）没有经常注意这一根本点，就造成了我们报纸思想性贫弱的后果，这问题必须予以严重的注意，须要每一个编写工作人员都来努力，以求得不断的改进。
    近半年来，各地重要报纸一般地已注意了加强马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的宣传的问题，许多报纸已加强了评论工作，这是很重要的，有了这些方面的改进已经使我们报纸的思想性提高了一步。但仅注意了这一方面是不够的。必须注意报纸上的每一篇新闻和通讯的思想性，善于从政治的立场、党的立场来报道各种实际工作，指明这种种工作的政治内容。反对在实际工作的报道中漠视政治的倾向。用具体的事例说明什么是对于各种现象、各种实际工作的报道中的政治的、党的立场，是加强报纸的思想性的重要关键。报纸编辑部应该经常注意这个问题，并领导编辑部工作人员，在这方面进行经常的学习和改进。
