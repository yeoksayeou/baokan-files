　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 19th (TASS dispatch): The final and complete results of the French parliamentary elections have not yet been announced. However, partial results from several constituencies demonstrate that despite the Communist Party facing ruthless obstruction during the campaign, including police brutality and rampant fascist terror, it still obtained the most votes in the election. According to the announcement at 12:30 on June 18th: Out of 17,100,349 votes, the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance (Communist Party and its allies) received 25.76 percent, de Gaulle's so-called French People's Rally received 20.84 percent, the Socialist Party received 15.15 percent, the Popular Republican Movement received 12.18 percent, the alliance of Independent Republicans and the Peasant Party (a right-wing election alliance) received 11.98 percent, and the remaining votes were obtained by various small parties.
    The French people's vote for the Communist Party demonstrates their will to strive for peace. In this way, the working people of France have thwarted the plan of the French reactionaries to isolate the Communist Party through various conspiracies and slanders, in order to implement their war policy without hindrance. The vote on June 17th demonstrates that the French masses do not need war and condemn the policies pursued by the government.
    Everyone knows that the French ruling clique, lacking confidence in its own strength in the election struggle, exhausted all means to barely get the National Assembly to pass a heinous election law, establishing an unfair and complex voting system. As a result of implementing this system, voters sometimes do not even know who they are voting for. The main purpose of this system is to use the infamous "alliance" system to drive the representatives of the working people – the Communists – out of the parliament. But even this system failed to help the ruling clique. According to the newspaper *Ce Soir*, the distribution of the 577 seats already announced out of the 627 seats in the National Assembly is as follows:
    Communist Party – 103 seats
    Socialist Party – 98 seats
    French People's Rally – 111 seats
    Popular Republican Movement – 85 seats
    "Independent Republican Peasant Alliance" – 82 seats
    "Left-Wing Republican Alliance" (a right-wing group centered on the Radical Socialist Party and the "Democratic Socialist Resistance Alliance") – 86 seats
    Other small parties – 12 seats.
    Based on these materials, it can be seen that although the Communist Party obtained the most votes, it will clearly lose many seats in the National Assembly due to the unfair and undemocratic election system. However, the Communist Party members will form a strong parliamentary group, a group capable of continuing to fight for the interests of the working masses.
    Progressive Republican Alliance candidate, Gothier, who was elected as a member of parliament in Lyon, told Agence France-Presse reporters: "The most obvious thing in these events is the unfair allocation of parliamentary seats. The Socialist Party has lost votes everywhere, but the Socialist Party has maintained its number of members, which absolutely cannot correspond to the Socialist Party's influence in the country." Gothier also said: The parties of the former government majority do not represent any real force.
    The preliminary results of the election have already caused chaos in the camp of the so-called "Third Force." The so-called "Third Force" is the coalition of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Socialist Party. They originally hoped to use the undemocratic election law they proposed to gain a majority position in the parliament. However, now, many leaders of these parties admit that, from now on, the "Third Force" no longer exists. Some parties that originally belonged to this camp have lost many votes. The Popular Republican Movement has lost votes particularly severely. Judging from preliminary statistics, the party has lost about half of its seats and half of its votes. These leaders have expressed concern about their future and are discussing various ways to establish a coalition government that can continue to pursue past policies.
    The *La Croix* newspaper of the Popular Republican Movement said today that the new National Assembly "seems to be much more right-leaning than the previous one." At the same time, the newspaper stated: "It may be a difficult thing to organize a pure government." Right-wing socialist, Moch, has already suggested that representatives of the so-called "Independent Republican Peasant Alliance" also participate in the future government. This electoral group, pieced together by the Independent Republican Party, the Peasant Party, and other right-wing parties, appeared in this election under the banner of the "Fourth Force." One of its initiators is Paul Reynaud, one of the "gravediggers of France" responsible for France's surrender to Hitler's Germany. But Moch also said: "On the other hand, ordinary members of the Socialist Party may not support this proposition. However, if such a coalition government led by the Socialist Party cannot be established, it will not be possible to form a government, and the result will inevitably be another election."

### 法美反动派选举阴谋遭到可耻失败  法选举初步结果法共得票最多

　　法美反动派选举阴谋遭到可耻失败  法选举初步结果法共得票最多
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎十九日讯：法国议会选举的最后完全结果现在还没有公布。然而若干选区的部分结果说明，虽然共产党在竞选期间遭到了警棒统治和法西斯恐怖暴行肆无忌惮的阻挠，但是仍然在选举中获得了最多的选票。据六月十八日十二时三十分宣布：在一千七百一十万零三千四百九十三张选票中，共和反法西斯抵抗联盟（共产党及其同盟者）获得了百分之二十五点七六，戴高乐的所谓法兰西人民联盟获得了百分之二十点八四，社会党获得了百分之十五点一五，人民共和党获得了百分之十二点一八，独立共和党与农民党联盟（右翼竞选联盟）获得了百分之十一点九八，其余票数为各小党派所得。
    法国人民投票选举共产党，显示了他们争取和平的意志。这样，法国的劳动人民就挫败了法国反动派企图利用各种阴谋和诽谤来孤立共产党，以便毫无阻碍地推行其战争政策的计划。六月十七日的投票说明了，法国人民群众并不需要战争，并且斥责政府所推行的政策。
    大家都知道，法国统治集团对自己竞选斗争的力量没有信心，竭尽一切力量，好容易才使国民议会通过了万恶的选举法，建立了不公平而复杂的投票制度。由于实行这种制度的结果，选民有时自己也不知道是在投谁的票。这种制度的主要目的，是要借恶名昭彰的“联盟”制度，把劳动人民的代表——共产党人，从议会里面赶出去。但连这种制度竟也没能帮助统治集团。据《今晚报》报道，在国民议会六百二十七个议席中已揭晓的五百七十七席分配情形是这样：
    共产党——一百零三席，
    社会党——九十八席，
    法兰西人民联盟——一百一十一席，
    人民共和党——八十五席，
    “独立共和农民联盟”——八十二席，
    “左翼共和联盟”（以激进社会党和“民主社会抵抗联盟”为核心的右翼集团）——八十六席。
    其他小党派——十二席。
    根据这些材料就可以看出：共产党虽然获得的选票最多，然而，由于不公平并且反民主的选举制度，却显然将在国民议会里面失去很多的议席，但共产党议员会组成强大的议会党团，这一个集团有能力继续为劳动大众的利益进行斗争。
    进步共和联盟候选人哥德在里昂当选为议员，他对法新社记者说：“这些事情中间，最明显的就是议会席位分配的不公平。社会党在每一个地方都丧失了选票，可是社会党却保持了它的议员人数，这种数目绝对不能和社会党在国内的影响相符合。”哥德又说：前政府多数派各党，都不代表什么真实的力量。
    选举的初步结果已经在所谓“第三种力量”的阵营中引起了混乱。所谓“第三种力量”就是社会党、人民共和党和激进社会党的联合。它们原来希望利用它们所提出的反民主的选举法而在议会中取得多数派的地位，但是，现在，这些党派的许多领袖都承认，从现在起，“第三种力量”已经不再存在了。原来属于这个阵营的某些政党损失了许多选票。人民共和党损失选票的情形尤其严重，根据初步统计来判断，该党大约损失了一半的议席和一半的选票。这些领袖们对于他们的前途已表示忧虑，而且正在讨论种种的办法，要建立一个可以继续奉行过去政策的联合政府。
    人民共和党的《十字架晚报》今日说，新的国民议会“似乎是比较上届议会要更右倾得多了”。同时该报表示：“要组织一个清一色的政府，怕是一件困难的事情。”右翼社会党人莫克已经在建议让所谓“独立共和农民联盟”的代表也参加将来的政府了。这个由独立共和党与农民党等右翼党派拼凑而成的选举集团在这次选举中是打着“第四种力量”的旗号出现的。它的发起人之一是保罗·雷诺，他是负责使法国向希特勒德国投降的“法国掘墓人”之一。但是莫克又说：“另一方面，社会党的普通党员不一定会支持这个主张。可是，如果不能建立以社会党领衔的这种联合政府，就会没有可能组成政府，而其结果就不可避免地只有再来举行一次选举。”
