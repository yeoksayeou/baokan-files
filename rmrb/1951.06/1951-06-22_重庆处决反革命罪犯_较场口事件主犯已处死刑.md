　　Chongqing Executes Counter-Revolutionary Criminals
    Principal Culprit of the Jiaochangkou Incident Executed
    The Second Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Enlarged Conference was held on the 11th to discuss the issue of sentencing a group of counter-revolutionary criminals. A total of 2,258 representatives attended the meeting. At the time of the meeting, more than 378,000 citizens across the city listened to the live broadcast of the conference.
    At the meeting, Liu Minghui, Chief Procurator of the Municipal People's Procuratorate, presented to the conference his opinions on the handling of 247 counter-revolutionary criminals. He said: According to the policy of combining suppression with leniency, and after discussions by the Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, this group of counter-revolutionary criminals will be sentenced according to the severity of their crimes. Forty-five were sentenced to death; twenty were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, forced labor, and observation of their future behavior; one hundred and fifty-four were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment; and twenty-eight were released after education and placed under the control of the people's masses assisting the government. Chief Procurator Liu pointed out that the criminals sentenced to death were all major special agents, major despots, heads of reactionary secret societies, habitual bandits, etc., who were guilty of heinous crimes and incorrigible, and whose execution was insufficient to appease popular indignation. For example, Yuan Xipei, a major special agent and one of the principal culprits of the Chongqing "Jiaochangkou Incident," led more than 40 special agents and hooligans in February 1946 to injure democratic figures such as Li Gongpu; subsequently, he destroyed the Xinhua Daily business department and injured more than ten newspaper staff members. In February 1947, when Chongqing students held demonstrations protesting the rape of Shen Chong by U.S. soldiers, the perpetrator again led dozens of special agents, using wooden sticks and carrying poles to injure students, and opened fire with machine guns, causing the "Datong Road Bloodshed." Tian Desheng, a major despot nicknamed the Chongqing "Local Emperor," had been running rampant in the Shuishi Lane area of Chongqing for decades, consistently relying on the reactionary ruling forces to oppress the people. He even interfered with the nearby residents' raising chickens and ducks, saying they disturbed him. On the eve of Chongqing's liberation, the perpetrator colluded with war criminal Zhang Qun and others to discuss sabotage plans; after liberation, he hid guns and refused to surrender them, continuing to commit evil deeds. Chief Procurator Liu said that if these ferocious counter-revolutionary ringleaders were not executed, the interests of the people's state would be seriously harmed.
    After relatives of the victims took the stage one after another to accuse the counter-revolutionary elements of their crimes, the representatives attending the meeting unanimously approved the judgment on the aforementioned counter-revolutionary criminals proposed by Procurator Liu Minghui.
    Those sentenced to death were executed by firing squad by the Military Tribunal of the Military Control Commission on the same day. When this group of counter-revolutionary criminals was escorted to the execution ground, citizens watched along the way, constantly shouting: "Resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries!"

　　重庆处决反革命罪犯
    较场口事件主犯已处死刑
    重庆市第二次各界人民代表扩大会议于十一日举行，讨论对一批反革命罪犯处刑问题。出席会议的代表共二千二百五十八人。开会时，全市有三十七万八千余市民收听大会实况广播。
    会上，市人民检察置检察长刘明辉向大会提出对二百四十七名反革命罪犯的处理意见。他说：根据镇压与宽大相结合的政策，并经市各界人民代表会议协商委员会讨论，对这批反革命罪犯，按其罪行轻重，四十五名判处死刑；二十名判处死刑，缓期两年，强迫劳动，以观后效；一百五十四名分别判处不同徒刑；二十八名教育释放后由人民群众协助政府予以管制。刘检察长指出：判处死刑的罪犯，都是罪恶深重，怙恶不悛不杀不足以平民愤的大特务、大恶霸以及反动会道门头子、惯匪等。如重庆“较场口事件”主犯之一的大特务袁西培，一九四六年二月率领特务、流氓四十多人打伤李公朴等民主人士；随后又捣毁新华日报营业部，打伤报社工作人员十余人。一九四七年二月，重庆市学生游行示威，抗议美军强奸沈崇暴行时，该犯又率领特务数十名，以木棒、扁担打伤学生，并用机枪扫射，造成“大同路血案”。外号重庆“土皇帝”的大恶霸田德胜，横行重庆市水市巷一带达数十年，一贯凭借反动统治势力，压榨人民。连附近居民喂鸡养鸭，他都要干涉，说是吵闹了他。重庆解放前夕，该犯与战犯张群等商定潜伏破坏计划；解放后，藏枪不缴，继续作恶。刘检察长说：像这些凶恶的反革命首犯，如不杀掉，人民国家的利益就要受到严重的损害。
    受害者亲属纷纷上台控诉反革命分子罪行后与会代表一致通过刘明辉检察长提出的对上述反革命罪犯的判决。
    被判处死刑的当日即由军事管制委员会军事法庭执行枪决。当这一批反革命罪犯押赴刑场时，市民沿途争看，不断地高呼：“坚决镇压反革命！”
