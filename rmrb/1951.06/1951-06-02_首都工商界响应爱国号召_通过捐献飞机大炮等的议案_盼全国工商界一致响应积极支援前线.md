One side of the river is devastated by enemy fire, while the other side enjoys freedom and happiness. If it weren't for the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting bravely against the enemy in Korea, we wouldn't be sitting here listening to this report in peace."

June 1, 1951, we, the representatives of various industries in the capital's industrial and commercial circles, listened to the report from the delegation to Korea on the heroic and moving deeds of our Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army on the Korean front to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, overcoming all difficulties. We are deeply moved. In order to more effectively strike at the enemy, the industrial and commercial circles of the capital warmly respond to the call of the industrial and commercial representatives of the delegation to Korea, hoping that the industrial and commercial circles will strive to donate. We vow to contribute all our strength and enthusiastically donate in order to supply the front with more airplanes, cannons, tanks, as well as nutritious food and various medical supplies, to actively support the front lines, and hope that the national industrial and commercial circles will respond unanimously, so as to strive for the early arrival of the final victory of resisting America, aiding Korea!
