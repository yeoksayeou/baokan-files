　　In the battles of late April, which dealt a heavy blow to the British 29th Brigade, many courageous lone warriors emerged from various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. With their bravery and ingenuity, and with the support of neighboring units, they created heroic examples of winning with fewer troops.
　　Height 257 was an important bridgehead on the south bank of the Linjin River. The Volunteer Army occupied it on the night of the counterattack, ensuring a steady flow of follow-up troops across the river. The British 29th Brigade had repeatedly counterattacked this height in an attempt to recapture it. Zhang Shuicheng, deputy platoon leader of a certain Volunteer Army unit, was ordered to lead five soldiers to relieve the defending unit there. After accepting the mission, Zhang Shuicheng excitedly led his comrades towards the designated position. On the way, the warriors discussed their combat tasks. They all had unlimited confidence in completing the mission. After they entered the position, the enemy launched successive charges against their position with a company of soldiers. The tactical movements of these British soldiers were the same as those of the American soldiers: first use artillery fire, then infantry crawls forward, and when they crawled halfway up the mountain, a Volunteer Army hand grenade would explode, and they would roll back down. During the enemy's first charge, the six warriors killed and wounded more than twenty enemies with hand grenades and submachine guns. As the battle became more intense, some of the six warriors were wounded and some were killed, but Zhang Shuicheng was still fine, and he stubbornly held the position alone. He took the two submachine guns of his comrades, plus his own, for a total of three, all fully loaded with ammunition. He used these three guns, jumping from one crater to another, firing back and forth at the enemy. A company of British soldiers could not break through the position he was defending, and instead more than forty were killed and wounded. By dusk, the remaining enemies climbed into their vehicles and fled south in panic.
　　The machine gun squad led by He Shurong guarded a hilltop position on the front line of Height 257. In the middle of the battle, their contact with the main position was cut off by the enemy's intense artillery fire, and the ammunition carrier was also seriously wounded. He Shurong was a member of the Youth League. He realized that his responsibility was great. If this hilltop were lost, Height 257, which his comrades had won with blood, would be under greater pressure from the enemy. Therefore, he was extra careful to protect himself and chose advantageous terrain to inflict casualties on the enemy. A company of enemies was bravely and cleverly defeated by him in two charges. During the enemy's second attack, they charged from three sides, shouting and yelling, like a swarm of wasps. He Shurong fired accurately. When the enemies on the left were repelled, he turned his gun and fiercely attacked those on the right. In this way, he shot the enemies until they all rolled down the mountain. More than thirty enemy corpses lay horizontally on the position.
　　After the enemy's counterattack on the hilltop positions on the south bank of the Linjin River failed, they fled south in panic, but were encircled and annihilated by the Volunteer Army near Xuemali. In the battle to block the enemy reinforcements, the courageous lone warrior Du Gende emerged. With the support of the machine gun squad soldiers on another hilltop, he alone repelled three charges by more than two hundred enemies, killing more than thirty enemies. The battle began on the morning of April 24. After Du Gende and his comrades repelled the enemy's two attacks, he alone held the hilltop position, which was about thirty meters wide. It was difficult for one person to hold such a wide hilltop. While the enemy was shelling and the infantry stopped charging, he placed hand grenades and grenades on the left, right, and middle of the position. The enemy began another attack, with more than a hundred enemies charging up the mountain. Du Gende threw eight grenades and ten hand grenades at the enemy, causing them to drag their corpses and roll down the mountain. He knew that the enemy was going to shell, so he found a hidden place to rest for a while, preparing to meet the enemy's next counterattack. As soon as the shelling stopped, more than two hundred enemies, divided into three routes, charged over under the cover of intense machine gun fire. At this time, the machine gun squad on another hilltop immediately provided fire support to Du Gende. Du Gende shot down the enemy machine gunner who was charging in front, then quickly climbed to the right side and threw grenades and hand grenades at the enemy, and then rushed to the left side to attack the enemy. The continuous explosions and the soaring thick smoke made it impossible for the enemy to figure out how many Volunteer Army soldiers were on the mountain. The enemy on the middle route retreated along with the left and right routes. Du Gende saw that he had few hand grenades and grenades left, so while the enemy was blindly shelling, he ran to the machine gun squad guarding another hilltop and got eight hand grenades and a lot of submachine gun bullets. After returning, he fully loaded four submachine guns, preparing to meet the enemy's fifth attack. The enemy shelled for more than an hour and dropped gasoline bombs from airplanes, burning the hilltop again. But the enemy infantry was terrified, and these guys crawled to a place more than forty meters away from the hilltop and lay still, only firing blindly at the hilltop with various automatic weapons. Du Gende used all his strength to throw grenades and hand grenades at the enemy continuously, driving the enemy to run desperately down the mountain. The enemy infantry, which had been defeated five times, dared not come up the mountain to die again, and the enemy tanks turned around and fled with this group of defeated soldiers. The enemy surrounded in Xuemali was annihilated by the Volunteer Army on this day.

　　以少胜多的独胆勇士们
　　赵普　若慈　浪涛
    在四月下旬痛击英军第二十九旅的战斗中，中国人民志愿军各部出现了许多独胆勇士，他们以自己的勇敢和机智，在友邻部队的支援下，创造了以少胜多的英勇战例。
    二五七高地是临津江南岸的一个重要桥头堡垒，志愿军在发起反击的当晚就占领了它，保证了后续部队的源源渡江。英军二十九旅曾经连续向这高地反扑，要想夺回它。志愿军某排副排长张水成奉命率领五个战士去那里接替兄弟部队的防务。张水成接受任务以后，带着战友们兴奋地向预定的阵地前进。勇士们在路上你一言我一语地谈论着自己的战斗任务。他们都对完成任务抱有无限的信心。他们进入阵地以后，敌人以一个连的兵力向他们的阵地连续冲锋。这些英国兵的战术动作也和美国兵一样：先用排炮轰，步兵跟着爬，爬到半山，志愿军的手榴弹一响，他们就跟着往下滚。在敌人发起第一次冲锋时，六勇士就用手榴弹和冲锋枪打死打伤了二十多个敌人。战斗越来越激烈，六个勇士当中有的负伤了，有的牺牲了，张水成却还好好的，他一个人顽强地守在阵地上。他拿来了战友们的两支冲锋枪，加上自己的一支，一共三支，都压满了子弹。他用这三支枪，从这个弹坑跳到那个弹坑，来回射击敌人。一个连的英国兵丝毫攻不动他所守的阵地，反而又被杀伤了四十多个。到了黄昏，剩下的敌人爬上汽车慌忙地向南逃去了。
    守卫二五七高地前沿一个山头阵地的，是由和树荣带领的机枪组。在战斗中间，他们和主阵地的联系被敌人的密集炮火阻断了，弹药手也负了重伤。和树荣是青年团员。他想到自己的责任很重大，如果这个山头一失守，战友们用鲜血换来的二五七高地就要受到敌人更大的压力。于是他格外谨慎小心地注意保全自己，选择有利地形杀伤敌人。一个连的敌人两次冲锋都被他勇敢机智地打垮了。敌人在第二次进攻的时候从三面冲上来，大喊大叫，乱哄哄地像一窝黄蜂。和树荣准确地射击着。左面上来的敌人被打退了，他就掉转枪来狠打右面的。就这样他把敌人打得都滚下山去。阵地上横倒着三十多个敌人的尸体。
    敌人反扑临津江南岸山头的阵地失败以后，就仓慌向南溃逃，可是逃到雪马里附近就遭到了志愿军的围歼。在阻击前来增援的敌人的战斗中，出现了独胆勇士杜根德。他在另一处山头上的机枪组战士们的支援之下，一个人打退两百多敌人的三次冲锋，打死敌人三十多个。战斗在四月二十四日上午开始。杜根德和他的战友们打退敌人的两次进攻以后，他一个人据守着约三十公尺宽的山头上。一个人要守住这样宽的山头是困难的。他趁着敌人正在打炮、步兵停止冲锋的时候，把手榴弹和手雷分别放在阵地的左边、右边和中间。敌人又开始了进攻，一百多个敌人冲上山来。杜根德对准敌群扔出了八个手雷和十个手榴弹，打得敌人拖着尸体滚下山去。他知道敌人要打炮了，就找好了隐蔽的地方休息一会，准备迎接敌人再一次的反扑。炮声一停，两百多敌人分成三路，在密集的机枪火力掩护下冲过来。这时，在另一处山头的机枪组，立即用火力支援杜根德。杜根德打倒了一个冲在前面的敌人的机枪射手，然后迅速地爬到右边去，对准敌人扔手雷和手榴弹，又急忙跑到左边去打敌人。连续的爆炸声和冲天的浓烟使敌人摸不清山上到底有多少志愿军。中间一路的敌人就随着左右两路一起溃退了。杜根德一看自己的手榴弹和手雷已经不多了，他趁着敌人盲目打炮的时候，跑到据守在另一山头上的机枪组那里要来了八颗手榴弹和很多冲锋枪子弹。回来以后，他把四支冲锋枪压满子弹，准备迎击敌人第五次的进攻。敌人炮击了一个多钟头，并且用飞机扔下汽油弹，把山头又烧了一遍。可是敌人步兵被打怕了，这些家伙爬到离山头还有四十多公尺的地方就伏下不动了，只是用各种自动火器向山头盲目射击。杜根德使出全身气力，把手雷和手榴弹向敌人连续抛过去，把敌人打得拚命地向山下跑。被打垮了五次的敌人的步兵再也不敢上山来送死了，敌人的坦克掉转头带着这群败兵一起逃跑了。被包围在雪马里的敌人就在这一天被志愿军歼灭了。
