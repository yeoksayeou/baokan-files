Agricultural Production

　　Experiences in Irrigation Management in Xinxiang Special District, Pingyuan Province

Editor's Note: At present, agricultural production in our country is frequently threatened by drought and flood. Most areas are still in a state of “relying on the heavens for food.” Therefore, vigorously developing irrigation, especially strengthening the management of existing irrigation facilities, is one of the basic tasks in agricultural construction. Now is the busiest irrigation season of the year, and this year also sees the most newly built and repaired irrigation canals, so it is necessary to fully value and do a good job in irrigation management and use water rationally. The experiences of Xinxiang Special District in irrigation management are worthy of reference by various localities.

Since the beginning of spring, Xinxiang Special District in Pingyuan Province has successively carried out the consolidation of irrigation projects. As of now, the spring work has been largely completed, and the remaining projects are being completed as quickly as possible. In order to make water conservancy work well serve summer planting and seedling protection, save water, and expand irrigation, the Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of construction section chiefs and river bureau directors on May 13 to study how to use water rationally and complete the tasks of drought resistance, sowing, and seedling protection. After the meeting, each larger river canal also convened different types of water release and water use meetings based on the river canal unit, gathering construction section chiefs, district heads, land user representatives, village cadres, water conservancy directors, Qinggou team leaders, water conservancy model workers, and other such representatives from relevant counties, with approximately 500 people participating. The meetings studied the current situation and the basis of spring repair projects, initially overcoming erroneous ideas such as "opening sources is more important than management" and "there will be a solution when the flood comes," and establishing an overall concept of unified management. Accepting past irrigation experiences and lessons of stealing water, seizing water, and wasting water, the meetings determined the main measures for rational water use, concentrating efforts, creating experience, and laying the foundation for rational water use in the future. From the above series of work, the following main experiences were obtained.

Three Key Links

    ① Political and ideological mobilization. Due to the close integration of patriotic education for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the mass mobilization was relatively thorough. It was universally recognized that saving water and irrigating more land was a practical action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, thus launching a competition to save water and irrigate more land. The economic and political losses caused by lack of experience, poor preparation, waste of water, and sabotage by special agents last year were avoided this year.

    ② Clearly establish an overall concept and strengthen unified leadership: In the past six months, in order to lay the foundation for unified leadership, various types of water conservancy representative meetings were convened to study methods. In the past, because the administrative aspects and the river bureau were unrelated or mutually dependent, a lot of water was wasted. This year, various methods were adopted to make everyone fully realize the importance of unified leadership. For example, the Guangli Canal area, involving four counties, eleven districts, one hundred and forty administrative villages, nearly 200,000 people, and 500,000 mu of irrigated land, would inevitably lead to serious waste if there was no unified leadership and water was used arbitrarily. After discussion and research by the representative meeting, an overall concept was established ideologically, and unified management organizations were established and improved organizationally; and on the basis of mass awareness, a unified management convention was formulated for mutual supervision and implementation, and water was released and land was irrigated in a timely manner.

    ③ Prepare well and strive for initiative. From the perspective of engineering, the entire district has repaired many management and irrigation buildings; and vigorously dredged branch canals and ditch canals, and merged branch canals to facilitate water distribution and delivery. From the perspective of organization, the old river bureaus have gradually been filled. For larger spring canals, the vast majority have convened representative meetings, established specialized management organizations, and formulated conventions. From the perspective of preparation before irrigation, larger river canals have formulated water release plans in order to release water and irrigate land on time. The work is relatively proactive.

Five Controls

    ① Organizational Control: The administrative and water conservancy committees provide unified leadership, organizing the masses, dividing labor and cooperating by field or ditch canal, combining field management and irrigation, and overcoming the contradiction between field management and irrigation. Facts have proven that only in this way can the problems of scattered irrigation, waste of water, manpower, and time be overcome. The administrative aspects and the river bureau have specific divisions of labor: the administrative aspects are responsible for establishing and improving management organizations at all levels, mobilizing the masses, leveling the land, and opening ridges; the river bureau is responsible for controlling water distribution, calculating time, and notifying the downstream to prepare for water supply on schedule.

    ② Control of Buildings and Tools: Most of the spring repair projects this year are control buildings. The Guangli Canal has 309 gate mouths, 2,539 underground culverts, the Dan River has 169 gate mouths, and other rivers and canals have also increased. The underground culverts of the Guangli Canal are equipped with gate boards and locks to prevent water leakage and theft. Last year, because the control buildings were poor, a lot of water from the Yongli Canal ran into the Mang River. At the same time, because water was controlled and stealing water was not easy, farmers reported a lot of unregistered land.

    ③ Water Volume Control:

    One, release water seasonally and appropriately: Water should not be released too early or too late. After discussion and research, the Guangli Canal determined that the number of waterings would begin on the 10th, based on the actual situation of wheat harvesting and sowing (wheat harvesting starts around June 6, and is generally completed by the 10th). Jiyuan County irrigates before threshing, Qinyang County irrigates after threshing the first batch, and Wen County and Meng County irrigate after threshing, so as not to miss the sowing season.

    Two, in order to release water for sowing in a timely manner, irrigate the rice ditches and fields that can be irrigated earlier before the watering schedule. And release water to the downstream to ensure that the wheat fields maintain a certain humidity and sow on wheat ridges. Avoid everyone rushing to use water at the same time, causing chaos. Dan Dong did this with great results, and was able to resist drought and sow more land.

    Three, allocate water according to land area: Register the area of land benefiting from each branch canal and ditch canal, calculate the water volume, and allocate irrigation time.

    Four, allocate water according to the water needs of crops (taking care of special crops). Generally, crops need water once every half month, with a water depth of 8 to 10 centimeters. Dan Dong’s allocation method is that rice fields, cucumbers, and vegetables need water every three days, and ginger fields need water every five to seven days (small area). Supervise the implementation in accordance with the convention.

    Five, level the land, open ridges and dredge ditches. The Dan Dong Convention stipulates that "land that is not leveled will not be irrigated until later." The Guangli Canal stipulates that "land that is not leveled and ridges that are not opened will not be irrigated." The reason is that if the land is not leveled and the ridges are not opened, it will waste water, and the land will not be irrigated evenly. It will not only be impossible to sow on time, but it will also be easy to run off water.

    ④ Manpower Control: Emphasize the responsibility system, with the river bureau and the administrative aspects having specific divisions of labor. The river bureau is responsible for receiving and delivering water on time and implementing the water regulations and conventions; the administrative aspects are responsible for mobilizing the masses to level the land and open ridges, and making all preparations. The Guangli Canal Management Bureau plans to send a cadre to be responsible for every ten miles or so. Each river proposed slogans: "Where the water goes, the cadres follow." And during irrigation, establish river patrol teams with militia as the backbone to patrol the river channels and check for leaks, water theft, and sabotage.

    ⑤ Disciplinary Control: Those who have made significant achievements in saving water, expanding irrigation, and developing and creating water use experience will be given honorary and material rewards. Saboteurs will be punished.

Three Priorities

    ① Rectify the team and train cadres. Each river bureau decided to convene an expanded cadre meeting before releasing water to implement the above work.

    ② The relevant counties, districts, and villages convene land user representative meetings to convey and implement the water use resolutions. And make the masses realize that the current situation is only the beginning of rational water use; only with everyone's joint efforts can greater results be achieved.

    ③ After each round of irrigation is completed, a small-scale connection meeting should be convened with the participation of government personnel, river bureau personnel, land user representatives, and water conservancy labor models to check the causes of success and failure, correct deviations, enrich knowledge, and create scientific water use experience.

    In order to promote the realization of the above work, the Special Commissioner's Office decided to transfer appropriate cadres, focusing on the Dan River and Guangli Canal, to create experience and promote the general.

　　平原省新乡专区管理灌溉的经验
    编者按：目前我国农业生产，经常受到旱、涝威胁，大部地区，仍处在“靠天吃饭”的状态。因此，大力发展灌溉事业，特别是加强对已有灌溉设备的管理，是农业建设中的基本任务之一。现在正是全年最繁重的灌溉季节，而今年各地新建新修的灌溉渠道也最多，所以必须充分重视和做好灌溉管理工作，使用水合理化。新乡专区管理灌溉的经验，值得各地参考。
    入春以来，平原省新乡专区先后进行了灌溉工程的整理。至目前为止，春工大体结束，部分残余工程正在抓紧时间完成。为使水利工作很好地服务于夏种保苗，节约用水，扩大浇地，专署曾于五月十三日召开建设科长及河局局长会议，研究如何合理用水，完成抗旱下种及保苗的任务。会后，各较大河渠又以河渠为单位，召集有关各县建设科长、区长、利地户代表、村干部、水利主任、青沟组长、水利模范等不同类型的放水使水会议，参加者约五百人左右，研究了当前情况及春修工程基础，初步克服了“开源重于管理”及“大水下来就有办法”等错误思想，树立了统一管理的整体观念。接受已往的灌溉经验及偷水霸水浪费水量的教训，确定了关于合理用水的主要措施。集中全力，创造经验，奠定今后合理使水的基础。从上述一系列工作中，取得了以下几点主要经验。
  三个环节
    ①政治思想动员。由于紧密结合了抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，群众的思想发动比较充分。普遍认识了节约水多浇地更是抗美援朝的实际行动，因而开展了节省水多浇地的竞赛。去年因为无经验、准备差、浪费水量和特务分子乘机破坏所造成的经济上和政治上的损失，今年得以避免。
    ②明确树立整体观念，加强统一领导：半年来，为了打下统一领导的基础，曾召开各种类型的水利代表会议，研究办法。过去因行政方面和河局互不相关，或相互依赖，曾使水量浪费很多。今年采取各种方式，使每个人充分认识到统一领导的重要。如广利渠四个县、十一个区、一百四十个行政村，将近二十万人口五十万亩水地的地区，如无统一领导，随便使水，必将造成严重浪费。经代表会讨论研究后，从思想上树立了整体观念，从组织上建立健全了统一管理的机构；并在群众的自觉基础上，制定了统一的管理公约，互相监督执行，适时放水浇地。
    ③作好准备，争取主动。从工程方面检查，全区已修理了不少管理灌溉的建筑物；并大力疏浚了支渠和斗渠，合并支渠，便利了水量分配和送水工作从机构上检查，旧有河局已逐渐充实。较大泉渠，绝大部分都召开了代表会议，建立了专管机构，订立了公约。从浇地前的准备上来看，较大河渠都拟订了放水计划，以便按时放水浇地，工作是比较主动的。
  五项控制
    ①组织控制：行政与水利委员会统一领导，将群众组织起来，以场或斗渠为单位，分工合作，边打场边浇地，克服打场和浇地的矛盾。事实证明，只有如此，才能克服分散灌溉、浪费水量、人力与时间的毛病。行政方面与河局具体分工：行政方面负责建立与健全各级管理机构，发动群众，整地扒畦；河局掌握水量分配，计算时间，通知下游准备按期给水等工作。
    ②建筑物及工具的控制：今年春修工程中，绝大部分是控制性的建筑物。计广利渠闸口三百零九座，阴洞二千五百三十九座，丹河闸口一百六十九座，其他河渠亦有增加。广利渠阴洞装了闸板上了锁，防止了漏水和偷水。去年因控制性建筑物较差，永利渠水跑到漭河不少。同时因为控制了水，偷水不易，农户报出了不少黑地。
    ③水量的控制：
    一、按季节适时放水：放水不能过早，也不能太迟。广利渠经过讨论研究，按照麦收和下种的实际情况（六月六日左右开始麦收，十日大体割完），确定十日开始轮号。济源县不打场就浇地，沁阳县打了头场浇地，温县、孟县打完场浇地，都不致误了下种季节。
    二、为了适时放水下种，将可以早灌水的稻沟场地在不轮号前浇完。并放水于最下游，争取作到麦地保持一定的湿度和麦垅点种。避免用水时大家都来争着用水，发生混乱现象。丹东这样作了，效果很大，能更多地抗旱下种。
    三、按地亩分配水量：以各支渠斗渠为单位，登记利地亩数，计算水量，分配浇地时间。
    四、按田禾需水配水（照顾特种作物）。一般作物半月一次水，水深八至十公分。丹东的分配办法，是稻田、黄瓜、菜蔬三天一次水，姜地五至七天一次（面积较小）。按照公约监督执行。
    五、平整土地，扒畦疏沟。丹东公约规定“地不整好，隔过不浇”。广利渠规定“地不耙平，畦不扒好，不浇”。原因是地不耙平畦不整好，一则浪费水量，二则地浇不匀。既不能按时下种，又易跑水。
    ④人力控制：强调责任制，河局和行政方面具体分工，河局掌握按时接水送水，贯彻水规公约；行政方面负责发动群众整地扒畦，作好一切准备。广利渠管理局计划每十里左右派一干部负责。各河提出口号：“水到那里干部跟到那里。”并在浇地中以民兵为骨干，建立巡河小组，巡查河道，检查漏洞及偷水破坏情况。
    ⑤纪律控制：对节约水量、扩大浇地、发挥与创造使水经验有显著成绩者，给予名誉与物质奖励。对破坏分子，给予惩办。
  三个重点
    ①整顿队伍，训练干部。各河局决定在放水前召开扩大干部会议，贯彻以上工作。
    ②各有关县、区、村召开利地户代表会，传达与贯彻使水决议。并使群众认识到目前仅是合理用水的开始；必须大家共同努力，才能收到更大效果。
    ③每轮浇地完毕后，要召集有政府人员、河局人员、利地户代表、水利劳动模范参加的小型接头会议，检查成败原因，纠正偏向，丰富知识，创造科学用水的经验。
    专署为了推动以上工作的实现。决定抽调适当干部，以丹河、广利渠为重点，创造经验，推动一般。
