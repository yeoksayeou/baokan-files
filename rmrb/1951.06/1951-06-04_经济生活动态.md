            Caring for People's Life Safety: Beijing Electric Power Bureau Conducts Safety Inspections
    With the assistance of the People's Government, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau launched city-wide electricity safety publicity and inspection work to eliminate electric shock accidents. In the past, electric shock injuries and deaths occurred every year, especially during the rainy season. The causes of the accidents were nothing more than: the electrical equipment of general users was simple and dilapidated, plus years of disrepair; the quality of electrical materials supplied in the market was too poor, without sufficient safety insulation; general users lacked electrical knowledge; and there were no emergency rescue measures after electric shock. In order to avoid electric shock accidents, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau printed a large number of propaganda posters and slogans, which have been publicized in various forms by the city's People's Government to the sixteen district governments in urban and suburban areas. At the same time, the Beijing Safety Inspection Committee was established, divided into three groups to inspect the city's internal lines, and appropriately repair them with a focus.

    北京电业局在人民政府协助下，展开全市用电安全宣传和检查工作，以消灭触电事故。过去每年发生触电伤亡事故，尤其在雨季更是严重。造成事故的原因，不外是：一般用户电器设备简陋，加上年久失修；市场上供应的电料质量太坏，没有足够安全的绝缘；一般用户缺乏电气常识；触电后又无紧急解救办法。北京市电业局为了避免触电事故发生，印了大批宣传画和标语，已由市人民政府号召城郊十六个区政府，通过各种形式进行宣传。同时成立了北京市安全检查委员会，分三组检查全市内线，并有重点地适当地加以改修。
