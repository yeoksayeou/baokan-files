　　The Soviet Union Commemorates Gorky's Death Anniversary
　　Report Meetings and Exhibitions Held in Moscow and Other Places
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 19th] The Soviet people commemorated the 15th anniversary of the death of the great Soviet revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky. According to TASS, more than 10,000 representatives from all walks of life in Moscow held a grand memorial meeting on the 18th at the Central Culture and Rest Park, presided over by Simonov, Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union. Memorial report meetings, symposiums, and concerts were held in Moscow's enterprises, workers' clubs, and educational institutions. A delegation from the Soviet Writers' Union and many Ukrainian writers laid wreaths at Gorky's tomb in Red Square.
　　On the 18th, the Pravda published an editorial commemorating Gorky, and published commemorative articles by famous Soviet writers such as Surkov, Chinese writer Cao Jinghua, and American writer Fast. The editorial pointed out that all of Gorky's works were dedicated to the noble cause of serving the people. The proud falcon and the stormy petrel he described, like songs, flew all over the world, arousing strong echoes among the working people of all countries. In the entire history of mankind, no writer has ever been as close to the people as he was, understanding the thoughts and aspirations of the working masses, and embodying them in his works with great artistic power. Gorky saw through the beastly face of American imperialism almost half a century ago. He called on progressive mankind around the world to actively fight against the instigators of imperialist war. Now that the peace movement is sweeping the world, Gorky's fiery words are making a great contribution to uniting the peace forces of the world.
　　Leningrad has held countless exhibitions on Gorky's life and works. A special exhibition department on "Gorky on America" has been set up in the Museum of the Russian Literature Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The audience is extremely crowded. In Gorky City, many people visit Gorky's childhood home every day. A monument has been newly built at the Dubrenka Railway Station in Voronezh Oblast, where Gorky worked in his youth. The Estonian Republic held 700 exhibitions of Gorky's works. Memorial gatherings commemorating Gorky were held in Stalingrad, Riga, Khabarovsk and other cities.

　　苏联纪念高尔基忌辰
    莫斯科等地举行报告会与展览会
    【新华社十九日讯】苏联人民纪念了苏联革命文豪高尔基逝世十五周年。据塔斯社讯：莫斯科各界代表一万余人，于十八日在中央文化与休息公园举行了盛大纪念会，由苏联作家协会副总书记西蒙诺夫主持。莫斯科各企业、工人俱乐部和教育机关纷纷举行了纪念高尔基的报告会、座谈会和音乐会。苏联作家协会的代表团和乌克兰作家多人到红场高尔基墓敬献花圈。
    十八日真理报发表纪念高尔基的社论，并刊载了苏联名作家苏尔科夫、中国作家曹靖华和美国作家法斯特等人的纪念文章。社论指出：高尔基的全部作品都是贡献于为人民服务的崇高事业的。他所描写的骄傲的鹰和暴风雨中的海燕，像歌声一样飞遍了全世界，在各国劳动人民中间引起强烈的回响。在整个人类史上，从来没有任何作家像他这样接近人民，了解劳动群众的思想与愿望，并以巨大的艺术力量把它们体现于作品之中。高尔基差不多在半世纪以前，就看穿了美帝国主义的野兽面目。他曾号召全世界进步人类积极进行反对帝国主义战争挑拨者的斗争。在和平运动遍及世界的现在，高尔基烈火般的语句对于团结全世界的和平力量是有着很大贡献的。
    列宁格勒举办了无数关于高尔基的生平和作品的展览会。在苏联科学院俄罗斯文学研究所博物馆，特别设立了“高尔基论美国”的陈列部。观众极为拥挤。在高尔基城，每天都有许多人访问高尔基的童年故居。在高尔基青年时代工作过的佛罗内兹州杜布连卡火车站，已新建了一座纪念碑。爱沙尼亚共和国举办了七百个高尔基作品展览会。在斯大林格勒、里加、伯力和其他城市，都举行了纪念高尔基的集会。
