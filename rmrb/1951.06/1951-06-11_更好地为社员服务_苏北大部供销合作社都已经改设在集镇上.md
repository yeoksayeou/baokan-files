　　Serving Members Better
　  Most Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Northern Jiangsu Have Been Relocated to Market Towns
    After rectification, 91% of the supply and marketing cooperatives in the Northern Jiangsu region have been relocated to market towns, and overly small village cooperatives have been merged. The experience of the past few months has proven that establishing cooperatives in market towns is very beneficial to the rational management and organization, and business development of cooperatives:
    1. Market towns are the commercial centers of rural areas and the central locations where usurers and brokers exploit farmers. Farmers are also accustomed to going to market towns to attend fairs. Therefore, establishing cooperatives in market towns can better serve members and attract a large number of non-members to invest. For example, after the Xinxia Cooperative in Sheyang County moved from Yutang Village to Yuwan Market, the number of members increased from over 500 to 2,140, and the daily turnover increased from hundreds of thousands of yuan to 3-4 million yuan. Moreover, information is readily available in market towns, allowing cooperatives to better cooperate with state-owned commerce to stabilize prices.
    2. Most market towns are close to rivers and highways, making it convenient for cooperatives to transport goods and reduce sales costs.
    3. After cooperatives are established in market towns, the capital expands, and more complete goods can be prepared, thereby better meeting the needs of members.
    4. Due to the increase in members and the expansion of business, the number of cadres increases, and the cooperative can implement a system of economic accounting with fixed personnel, quotas, and rates.
    5. Market towns are also the political centers of rural areas, where district and township people's governments and CCP party committees are located. Larger market towns also have state-owned trading institutions. Establishing cooperatives in market towns makes it easier to obtain assistance from all parties.
    After the Northern Jiangsu region relocated its cooperatives to market towns, the business expanded, and the phenomenon of crowded customers became widespread. Therefore, the original all-in-one management method was changed to establish supply and marketing departments, allocate funds, keep separate accounts, and calculate profits and losses separately. The following methods were also adopted to make it convenient for members to buy and sell goods: 1. Set up more retail outlets. 2. Implement closed-market delivery to avoid the phenomenon of members crowding to buy goods during market days. 3. Implement "delivery upon signing," simplifying transaction procedures.
    After the cooperatives were established in market towns, the organization expanded. Therefore, new methods must be adopted in implementing democratic management and maintaining close relations with members. According to the experience of the Northern Jiangsu region, the following methods can be adopted to solve this problem: 1. Use group leaders as representatives to hold representative meetings. 2. Directors and supervisors lead their respective group representatives, and regularly convene directors', supervisors' and group meetings or joint group meetings. 3. Set up suggestion boxes. 4. In places where conditions permit, add clubs, and send special personnel to solicit opinions from members on market days, and report on the cooperative's situation and understand the needs of members.

### 更好地为社员服务  苏北大部供销合作社都已经改设在集镇上

　　更好地为社员服务
　  苏北大部供销合作社都已经改设在集镇上
    经过整顿以后，苏北区百分之九十一的供销合作社已改设在集镇上，过小的村合作社已经合并。几个月来的经验证明，在集镇上建社，对合作社合理的经营管理和组织、业务的发展都有很大好处：
    一、集镇是农村的商业中心，是高利贷者、牙纪等剥削农民的中心地点，农民又习惯于到集镇上去赶集，所以合作社设在集镇上，便可以更好地为社员服务，同时也可以吸引广大非社员来入股。如射阳县新厦合作社从渔塘村搬到渔湾集后，社员便从五百多人增加到二千一百四十人，每天的营业额从几十万元增加到三、四百万元。而且，集镇上消息灵通，合作社更可以配合国营商业稳定物价。
    二、集镇大多靠近河流、公路，合作社运货方便，可以减低售货成本。
    三、合作社设在集镇上后，资金扩大，货品可以准备得更齐全些，因而能够更多地满足社员的需要。
    四、由于社员增多，业务扩大，干部增加，合作社便可以实行定员、定额、定率的经济核算制。
    五、集镇又是农村的政治中心，区、乡人民政府和中共党委机关都在那里，较大的集镇还有国营贸易机构，合作社设在集镇上，更容易得到各方面的协助。
    苏北区把合作社改设在集镇上后，业务扩大了，又普遍发生了顾客拥挤的现象。因此改变了原来一揽子的经营方法，设立供应、推销两个部门，划分资金，分别记账，各算盈亏。并且采用了以下办法使社员买卖货物时得到方便：一、多设门市部。二、实行闭集送货，避免逢集时社员买货拥挤的现象。三、实行“凭签发货”。简化交易手续。
    合作社设在集镇上后，组织扩大了，因此在实行民主管理、密切与社员的关系上，也必须采用新的方式。据苏北区的经验，可以采用下面这些办法来解决这个问题：一、以小组长作代表，开好代表会议。二、理、监事分别领导所属小组代表，按期召开理、监事会和小组会或小组联席会。三、设置意见箱。四、有条件的地方增设俱乐部，逢集派专人向社员征求意见，并报告合作社的情况，了解社员的需要。
