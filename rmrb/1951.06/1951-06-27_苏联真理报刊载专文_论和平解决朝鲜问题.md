Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th: The newspaper "Pravda" published an article by Khalamov entitled "Struggle for Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Conflict." Khalamov wrote: "On June 25th of last year, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) army attacked the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Following the launch of the attack, the United States then carried out armed intervention against the freedom-loving Korean people. The war has brought enormous disaster to the Korean people. Millions of innocent Korean people have sacrificed their lives."

The article continued: "The Korean War has not and will never bring victory to the aggressors. The Korean people, receiving the unanimous sympathy of all progressive humanity, are determined to defend the freedom and independence of their country to the very end. More and more American invading soldiers are sacrificing their lives for the interests of a handful of millionaires. However, despite the huge losses in manpower and equipment suffered by the Anglo-American ruling circles, and despite the obvious hopelessness of this adventure, the Anglo-American ruling circles are still continuing the war in Korea."

The author pointed out: "Needless to say, this war cannot be viewed in isolation from the entire international situation. This war is part of the aggressive policy pursued by Western countries, primarily the United States, over the past few years. It is this policy that has given rise to military aggressive blocs—primarily the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—and the establishment of hundreds of American military bases on the territories of other countries—Britain, France, Norway, Iceland, as well as countries in the Near East and Far East."

"This policy is manifested in the frantic arms expansion movement carried out by the United States and other capitalist countries, as well as the remilitarization of West Germany and Japan. All these war preparations have created an atmosphere of anxiety and tension throughout the world."

"The armed intervention in Korea by the United States and some other countries is the most open and direct manifestation of this aggressive policy. The armed conflict in Korea has further aggravated the entire international situation. The development of the situation surrounding the Korean War clearly shows that the course followed by the American ruling circles was, and still is, to expand the war."

The author continued: "Since the beginning of the war, the Soviet government has repeatedly put forward proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict. For example, the Soviet Union supported Prime Minister Nehru of India's proposals in this regard. Last August, the Soviet Union proposed a 'peaceful resolution of the Korean problem' and requested the Security Council to consider it. Later, the Soviet delegation to the Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations put forward new proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. However, the Anglo-American majority in the United Nations rejected these proposals, which could have peacefully resolved the Korean problem."

The author emphasized: "The Soviet Union's position on the Korean War stems from the consistent peace policy of a socialist country. The Soviet people have been unwavering in their struggle for peace and peaceful cooperation among nations."

"Guided by the principles of maintaining and consolidating peace and international cooperation, the Soviet people are now, have been, and always will be in favor of a peaceful resolution of the armed conflict in Korea and the elimination of the causes of international tension."

"The Soviet people firmly believe that a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem is entirely possible. The Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, pointed out this possibility in the United Nations Department of Public Information's 'The Price of Peace' radio program on June 23, 1951."

The author pointed out: "Preliminary comments on this speech indicate that the statements made by the Soviet representative have received the most enthusiastic attention from world public opinion, and democratic circles in various countries have universally expressed their support."

"Even conservative bourgeois newspapers have acknowledged the value of Malik's proposals. The London Times stated: 'Many circles believe that this speech is a serious proposal to all countries fighting in Korea.'"

"The New York correspondent of the British Sunday Chronicle reported: 'The proposals made by Malik in his speech can serve as a basis for negotiations.'"

"The American New York Times stated: 'Ceasefire negotiations are possible and should begin as soon as possible.'"

The author concluded: "Stopping the war and peacefully resolving the Korean conflict can eliminate a major cause of the current international tension. In this way, the Korean people can return to a peaceful life and solve their own problems."

　　苏联真理报刊载专文
    论和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：《真理报》刊载哈拉莫夫所作题为《争取和平解决朝鲜冲突》一文。哈拉莫夫写道：去年六月二十五日，李承晚军队进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。在进攻发动以后，美国跟着对爱好自由的朝鲜人民实行武装干涉。战争给朝鲜人民带来了巨大的灾难。千千万万无辜的朝鲜人民牺牲了生命。
    该文继称：朝鲜战争不曾而且决不会给侵略者带来胜利。朝鲜人民得到全体进步人类的一致同情，他们已下定决心把他们祖国的自由和独立保卫到底。愈来愈多的美国侵略军士兵为一小撮百万富翁的利益，牺牲了自己的生命。但是，尽管美英统治集团在有生力量和装备方面遭受巨大损失，尽管这种冒险显然毫无希望，美英统治集团仍然继续在朝鲜进行战争。
    作者指出：不消说，这个战争是不能与整个国际局势分开来看的。这个战争是西方国家，首先是美国在过去几年中奉行的侵略政策的一部分。正是这个政策产生了军事侵略集团——主要是北大西洋联盟，并在其他国家——英国、法国、挪威、冰岛以及近东和远东国家——领土上建立了数以百计的美国军事基地。
    这种政策表现在美国和其他资本主义国家所进行的疯狂的扩充军备运动以及西德和日本的重新军国主义化上。所有这一切战争准备在全世界各地造成了一种焦虑和紧张的气氛。
    美国和其他一些国家武装干涉朝鲜，是这种侵略政策的最公开的直接表现。朝鲜的武装冲突使整个的国际局势更形严重。围绕着朝鲜战争形势的发展，十分清晰地表明了美国统治集团所遵循的路线过去是而且现在也是扩大战争。
    作者继写道：自从战争开始以来，苏联政府曾一再提出和平解决朝鲜冲突的建议。例如苏联曾经支持印度尼赫鲁总理在这方面的建议。去年八月苏联曾提出“和平解决朝鲜问题”的建议，请安全理事会考虑。以后苏联代表团在联合国第五届大会上又提出和平解决朝鲜战争的新建议。然而，联合国中的英美多数，却拒绝了这些能够和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。
    作者着重指出：苏联对朝鲜战争的立场是从社会主义国家一贯的和平政策出发的。苏联人民一直在坚持不渝地为和平与国际间的和平合作而斗争。
    苏联人民在维持与巩固和平与国际合作的原则指导之下，现在是过去也一直是主张和平解决朝鲜的武装冲突，消除造成国际间紧张局势的原因的。
    苏联人民坚信，和平解决朝鲜问题是完全可能的。苏联驻联合国代表马立克于一九五一年六月二十三日在联合国新闻部所主办的“和平的代价”广播节目中，指出了这种可能性。
    作者指出：对于这篇演说的初步评论说明，苏联代表所发表的主张，受到世界公众最热心的注意，各国民主阶层都普遍表示拥护。
    即使保守的资产阶级报纸也承认马立克建议的价值。伦敦《泰晤士报》说：许多阶层的人都认为这篇演说是向在朝鲜作战的各国所提出的一个严肃的建议。
    英国《星期日纪事报》驻纽约记者报道说：马立克在演说中提出的主张可以作为谈判的基础。
    美国《纽约时报》说：停火谈判可能而且应该尽早开始。
    作者在结语中说：停止战争与和平解决朝鲜冲突，可以消除造成目前国际紧张局势的一个主要原因。这样，朝鲜人民就能恢复和平生活，自己解决自己的问题。
