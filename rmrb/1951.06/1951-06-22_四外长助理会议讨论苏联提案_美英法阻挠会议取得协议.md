Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th. The meeting of the four Deputy Foreign Ministers, convened to prepare the agenda for the four Foreign Ministers' conference, continues in Paris. At the meeting, the representatives of the US, Britain, and France, with no justification and at the end of their arguments, continued to oppose the Soviet representative's proposal to include the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the issue of American military bases on the agenda, obstructing the achievement of an agreement. In the meeting on June 8, the statements of the Western countries' representatives completely repeated old arguments that had already been refuted, proving that they could not present any strong arguments against the Soviet proposals. The Paris newspaper *Le Monde* also admitted this on the 11th, saying: "The Western representatives had intended to draft a note to the Soviet Union...but they finally declared that they had nothing new to say to the Soviet representative."

From June 11 to June 18, the four representatives held another six meetings. The Western countries' representatives had exhausted their arguments to such an extent that they even used the fact that the Soviet representative had not raised the issue of the Atlantic Treaty and American military bases at the beginning as a reason to oppose including this issue, even as an unresolved item, in the appendix to the Foreign Ministers' conference agenda. At the meeting on the 13th, not one of the Western countries' representatives was willing to speak. At the meeting on the 14th, they raised various questions to the Soviet representative that had already been answered, delaying the progress of the meeting. At the meeting on the 15th, the Western countries presented a new note, formally stating that they could not reach an agreement on the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty and American military bases, which constitute the main cause of the current international tension, and believed that there was no need to continue holding assistant meetings. Instead, a Foreign Ministers' conference should be held in Washington based on the agenda proposed by the Western countries on May 22.

In his initial reply to the Western countries' note, Soviet representative Gromyko pointed out that the three governments' note indicated that they wanted to refuse to accept the Soviet proposal on the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty and American military bases, in order to continue delaying the meeting. From these notes, it can be seen that the three governments do not want to reach an agreement on the agenda, nor do they want to ensure the convening of a Foreign Ministers' conference to discuss the important and urgent issues of ensuring peace and improving relations between the four countries. The three governments and their representatives talk about convening a Foreign Ministers' conference because they want to use it to achieve other goals, rather than to eliminate tension in Europe and improve relations between the four countries.

Because the Western countries' representatives insisted on not discussing the issue of the Atlantic Treaty and American military bases, and insisted on waiting to receive the Soviet government's reply to the three countries' note before holding a meeting, the meeting on the 18th ended without result.

### 四外长助理会议讨论苏联提案  美英法阻挠会议取得协议

　　四外长助理会议讨论苏联提案
    美英法阻挠会议取得协议
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社巴黎消息，为四国外长会议准备议程而召开的四国外长助理会议继续在巴黎举行。会上，理屈辞穷的美英法三国代表继续毫无理由地反对苏联代表所提把北大西洋公约和美国军事基地的议案列入议程，阻挠会议达成协议。在六月八日的会议上，西方国家代表的发言完全重复了历经驳斥的旧调，证明他们不可能提出任何有力的论据反对苏联的建议。巴黎《世界报》于十一日也承认这一点说：“西方代表曾打算拟定一个照会给苏联……但是他们最后还是声明说，他们已经没有什么新的东西对苏联代表讲了。”
    从六月十一日到六月十八日，四国代表又举行了六次会议。西方国家代表已如此辞穷，他们甚至把苏联代表没有在一开始就提出关于大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题作为理由，反对将这问题甚至作为未获协议的议案列入外长会议的议程附录。在十三日会议上，西方国家代表干脆没有一人愿意发言。在十四日会议上，他们向苏联代表提出种种早经答复过的问题，拖延会议的进展。到十五日会议上，西方国家提出了一项新的照会，正式表示它们不可能在北大西洋公约和美国军事基地这个构成目前国际紧张局势主要原因的问题上获致协议，并认为没有继续举行助理会议的必要，只应该以西方国家五月二十二日所提议程为基础在华盛顿举行外长会议。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在初步答复西方国家的照会时指出，三国政府的照会表示它们要拒绝接受苏联关于北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题的建议，以便继续拖延会议。从这些照会可以看出，三国政府并不希望在议程方面达成协议，也不希望保证召开外长会议，以讨论确保和平与改善四国关系的重要而急迫的问题。三国政府及其代表谈论召开外长会议是因为他们要利用它来达到其他目的，而不是为了消除欧洲的紧张局势与改善四国关系。
    由于西方国家代表坚持不讨论大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题，一定要等收到苏联政府对三国照会的复文才开会，十八日会议仍无结果而散。
