Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 25th: All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, wiring from the Korean front to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulate the Communist Party of China on its thirtieth anniversary. The telegram reads as follows: Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:
	
	We are warmly celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on the Korean front, and we extend our heartfelt congratulations and greetings to you and the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee. The Communist Party of China is the savior of the Chinese people. It led our people to achieve the great victory of the revolution, and it is leading our people to begin the great construction work. For more than a year, under your leadership and the leadership of the Party, New China has become an independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous country. Because our country has formed an unbreakable alliance of mutual assistance with the powerful Soviet Union, it has also become a pillar for defending world peace. We are proud and proud to be the people of this great country, citizens of Mao Zedong's motherland. We have been entrusted by the people of our motherland to assist the Korean People's Army in fighting the U.S. aggressors for more than eight months. In Korea, we have personally witnessed the brutal and barbaric acts of the U.S. aggressors in destroying peaceful towns and villages and slaughtering peaceful residents. We deeply feel the profound disasters suffered by the Korean people, and we are even more convinced that our cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country is just. "Fight to aid the liberation of the Korean people!" "Fight to defend world peace!" "Win glory for the motherland!" "Win glory for Chairman Mao!" This is our oath of brave fighting. For more than eight months, we have been closely united with the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side. With inferior equipment, we have assisted the Korean People's Army in defeating the U.S. aggressor troops and their accomplice troops, who have powerful naval, air, and superior equipment, in just eight months. We have annihilated more than 240,000 enemy troops, completely shattered the American aggressors' dream of conquering Korea, and laid the foundation for the victory of the Korean people's anti-aggression war. We know that we still have a long and arduous battle ahead of us. We will work with the Korean People's Army to use more heroic and more intelligent battles to achieve the final victory. Our operations are not isolated. Supporting us are the 475 million people of our great motherland, the Korean people who are advancing bravely in the flames of war, and the hundreds of millions of people around the world who love peace. The recent movement of the people of the motherland to donate airplanes, tanks, and artillery is encouraging us to annihilate more enemies. We will not only achieve the final victory in a protracted battle, but also grow into a strong modern army in the battle. In front of such an army, there is no enemy that cannot be defeated.

	All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
