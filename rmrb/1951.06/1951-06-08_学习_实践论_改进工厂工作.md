　　Studying "On Practice" to Improve Factory Work
　　Technician of Northwest Automobile Parts Factory Zhao Sheng
　　After Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" was published, it was of particular interest to me as a factory worker to study it. First, "On Practice" tells us that "man's productive activity is the most basic practical activity, and is what determines all other activities." And in the present era of large-scale industry, the factory is undoubtedly the most important link in productive activity. The activities of industrial production often affect other activities of society. Therefore, we factory workers should appreciate the importance of our work. Our practice is a basic practice of society, which has a significant impact on national strength and social progress.

　　(I)
　　The central task of a factory is production, and all other work should revolve around production and serve production. This should be the case not only in our factories under the New Democratic economy, but also in factories under the capitalist economy; it is true in public factories and private factories alike.

　　But many of our cadres often overlook this simple truth. Some of our political workers mechanically treat the factory as a political school, some trade union workers mechanically treat the factory as a collective big family, and some technical workers mechanically treat the factory as an experimental site. Each person works according to their own wishes, resulting in contradictions and production losses.

　　In the factory, politics serves production, and increased production, in turn, serves politics. This dialectical unity of politics and technology in factory practice should be the guiding principle for every political worker and technical worker. Emphasizing one aspect and neglecting the other will inevitably lead to mistakes.

　　Production is the embodiment of the unity of productive forces and production relations in the production process. In the context of a factory, productive forces are embodied in labor power, factory equipment, and technical conditions, while production relations are embodied in factory management and division of labor. Production will only develop when these two necessary factors are unified.

　　Therefore, every factory worker must correctly and deeply recognize this principle of "production is the basic practice" and consciously implement it in practical work.

　　(II)
　　Comrade Mao Zedong clearly explained the issue of the unity of theory and practice in "On Practice." Factories and laboratories are places where existing theories in natural science are transformed into practice, and where practical experience is accumulated to improve theory. They are important places for the practice of transforming nature. By studying "On Practice," we factory workers can correct our realistic attitude towards scientific knowledge and correct the dogmatism and empiricism in our factories.

　　In the factory, theory generally belongs to the staff, and practice belongs to the workers. How to organically unite theory and practice also includes the further unity of staff and workers, which is what we factory workers urgently need to resolve.

　　Some factory workers with empiricist tendencies are confined to their own fragmented experiences for a long time and do not understand or underestimate the importance of theory to work. They often say, "I haven't seen it like this before." "I've been working for twenty or thirty years, and I've still been able to do the job without theory." They are conservative in their one-sided views, despise theory, and fear theory, which is detrimental to the development of the factory. For example, when some factories promoted high-speed cutting, they were blindly opposed by empiricists, which greatly affected the improvement of output.

　　Factory workers with dogmatic tendencies mostly absorb knowledge only from foreign books and are not good at combining it with China's existing conditions and absorbing new experiences. They often treat the creativity of Chinese workers themselves incorrectly and underestimate the creativity of the masses of workers. In the two years since liberation, such examples have been seen repeatedly. They are accustomed to using dogma to scare people: "I haven't seen it like this abroad." "This is not in such-and-such handbook." Because they rigidly adhere to dogma, the development of our factories has also been affected.

　　We must seriously and kindly criticize empiricists and dogmatists. "On Practice" is our principle of criticism. Empiricists do not understand that rich experience should be transformed and improved to become rational knowledge. Dogmatists do not understand the principle that "knowledge begins with experience," do not know how to contact the masses, learn from the masses, and obtain a large amount of experience in various aspects from the practical experience of the productive activities of the broad masses.

　　Only when workers and staff jointly overcome the two deviations of empiricism and dogmatism will the staff and workers be further united. Facts have proved that the vigorous unity and mutual assistance of staff and workers will greatly advance factory work.

　　(III)
　　"On Practice" tells us: "Generally speaking, whether in the practice of changing nature or changing society, it is rare for people's original ideas, theories, plans, and programs to be realized without any change... Many times, we must repeatedly fail many times before we can correct wrong understandings, before we can reach conformity with the laws of the objective process, and thus be able to transform subjective things into objective things, that is, obtain the expected results in practice."

　　In the process of using mechanical power in factories to transform nature, people often encounter failures and situations where the original design differs greatly from the realized result. We cannot expect success with one or two experiments. We must realize that our industrial construction is in the process of development, not only restricted by scientific and technical conditions, but also restricted by the development of the objective process and the degree of its expression. We must not fear hardship or danger, face the possibility of failure and the possibility of error, and strive to turn error into correctness and failure into victory.

　　In the process of practice, after repeated failures many times, reaching the expected result can be said to be the completion of the movement of cognition of this objective process. However, the objective process is moving forward and developing forward, and people's cognitive movement should also move and develop accordingly. In this way, the cognitive movement develops along with the development of the objective process and must never stop at the completion of a certain process.

　　Our factory workers often mistakenly stop subjective cognition at the completion of a certain original design or a certain process, which hinders the development of production. When we perfectly use the existing speed of machine tools for cutting, we must study and prepare for future development to high-speed cutting. When we perfectly use the organization of the division of labor under the current output, we must study and prepare for the organization of labor that will develop to higher output in the future. When we perfectly launched production competitions and created new records, we must study how to develop to even higher new records in the future... Only in this way can we continuously advance, continuously improve, and adapt to the rapidly developing factory work under the New Democratic economy.

　　If our subjectivity is separated from objectivity, and we linger in or are complacent with the completion of a certain process, and are not good at seeking higher-level achievements on top of the existing achievements, then we will hinder the development of the factory, or be discarded by the wheels of industrial progress.

　　(IV)
　　Factory work is detailed and complex work, and it is also basic work in economic construction. For many factory workers, this is new work that needs to be learned from scratch.

　　In the past two years, we have explored a lot of experience in factory work, mastered a lot of objective laws in factory work, and universally improved production. But we must admit that these achievements are not enough. The state's investment in factories is so large, and the expectations for us are so eager. Errors often occur in our work, and our dogmatists and empiricists have caused certain losses to factory work countless times, whether large or small. Our comrades in factory work must seriously study "On Practice." "On Practice" has opened up the road of ideological revolution for us factory workers, and we should follow this road forward.

　　学习“实践论”改进工厂工作
    西北汽车制配厂技术员  赵晟
    毛泽东同志的《实践论》发表后，作为一个工厂工作者是特别有兴趣来学习的。首先，《实践论》中告诉我们“人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西。”而在大工业出现的现在，工厂无疑地是生产活动中最重要的环节。工业生产的活动，常常都影响到社会其他的活动。所以我们工厂工作者应该体会出自己工作的重要。我们的实践是社会的基本实践，对国家强盛、社会进步有重大的影响。
            （一）
    工厂的中心工作是生产，其他一切工作都应该围绕在生产的四周为生产服务。这不仅在我们新民主主义经济下的工厂应如此，在资本主义经济下的工厂也是如此；在公营工厂中如此，在私营工厂中也是如此。
    但这点浅显的道理，我们许多干部却常常忽略了它。我们有些政治工作者机械地把工厂当做政治的学校，有些工会工作者机械地把工厂当做集合的大家庭，有些技术工作者机械地把工厂当做实验的场所，各人都按照自己的愿望去工作，以致互相矛盾，造成生产上的损失。
    在工厂中政治是为生产服务的，生产提高了，又为政治服务。这样政治与技术在工厂实践中辩证的统一，应该是每一个政治工作者及技术工作者的圭臬。强调了那一方，疏忽了那一方，都不可免地招致错误。
    生产是生产力与生产关系在生产过程中的统一之体现。就工厂的范畴来说，生产力体现在劳动力、工厂的设备及技术条件方面，生产关系体现在工厂的管理及分工组织方面，只有这两个必要因素互相统一起来，生产才会发展。
    所以我们每一工厂工作者必须正确地深刻地认识这一“生产是基本的实践”的原则，有意识地把它贯彻到实际工作中去。
            （二）
    毛泽东同志在“实践论”中极其明了地说出理论同实践统一的问题。工厂及实验所是将自然科学中已有的理论变成实践，而又通过实践经验的累积以提高理论的地方，是变革自然的实践的重要场所。我们工厂工作者学习了“实践论”，就可以端正我们对科学知识的实事求是态度，都可以纠正我们工厂中的教条主义及经验主义。
    在工厂中，一般是理论属于职员、实践属于工人的。怎样去将理论同实践有机地统一起来，也就包括了职员及工人的进一步团结问题，而这又是我们工厂工作者亟应求得解决的。
    某些有经验主义毛病的工厂工作者，长期拘泥于自身的片断经验，不了解或轻视理论对工作的重要。他们常说：“我以前没有看到这样。”“我做工二三十年了，没有理论还不是做出活来。”他们保守于一得之见，轻视理论，害怕理论，这样对工厂的发展就有妨害。例如有的工厂在推行高速度切削时，受到经验主义者的盲目反对，就大大地影响了产量的提高。
    有教条主义毛病的工厂工作者，他们多半只从外国的书籍中吸取知识，不善于结合中国现有的条件，吸取新的经验。他们时常错误地对待中国工人自己的创造性，估低了工人群众的创造力。在解放后两年来，这样的例子曾屡见不鲜。他们惯于用教条吓唬人：“我在国外没有看到这样。”“某某手册中没有这一条。”由于他们死守教条，我们工厂的发展也受到了影响。
    必须严正而善意地批评经验主义及教条主义者。“实践论”是我们批评的原则。经验主义者不了解把丰富的经验加以改造提高，使成为理性知识。教条主义者不了解“认识开始于经验”的这一原理，不懂得联系群众，向群众学习，从广大群众的生产活动的实践经验中去获取大量的各方面的经验。
    只有工人同职员共同克服了经验主义和教条主义这两种偏向，职员工人才会更进一步地团结起来。事实证明，职员同工人有力地团结互助，就会使工厂工作大步地进展。
            （三）
    “实践论”告诉我们：“一般地说来，不论在变革自然或变革社会的实践中，人们原定的思想、理论、计划、方案，毫无改变地实现出来的事，是很少的。……许多时候须反复失败过多次，才能纠正错误的认识，才能到达于和客观过程的规律性相符合，因而才能够变主观的东西为客观的东西，即在实践中得到预想的结果。”
    在工厂利用机械力变革自然的过程里，人们遇着失败，遇着原定的设计同实现出来的结果大有不同的情形是很多的。我们不可能期望一次两次的实验就能成功。我们必须注意到我们的工业建设正在发展过程中，不但受着科学条件与技术条件的限制，而且也受着客观过程的发展及其表现程度的限制。我们要不畏劳苦不畏险阻地正视失败的可能性和错误的可能性，努力于变错误为正确，变失败为胜利。
    在实践过程中，反复失败了好多次。达到了预想的结果，可说是这一客观过程的认识运动完成了。但是客观过程是向前推移向前发展的，人们的认识运动也应跟着推移与发展。这样认识运动随着客观过程的发展而发展，决不能停止在某一过程的完成上。
    我们工厂工作者常错误地将主观的认识停止在某一原定设计或某一过程的完成上，这是有碍生产的发展的。我们完善地运用机床的现有速度来切削，就必须研究准备将来发展到高速度的切削。我们完善地运用现在产量下的分工劳动的组织，就必须研究准备将来发展到更高产量的劳动组织。我们完善地发动了生产竞赛创造了新纪录，就必须研究将来如何发展到更高的新纪录。……这样我们才能不断前进，不断提高，才能适应新民主主义经济下的飞速发展的工厂工作。
    如果我们主观与客观相分裂，逗留于或自满于某一过程的完成上，不善于在既有的成果之上求更高一级的成就，则将阻碍了工厂的发展，或将被工业前进的车轮所摔弃。
            （四）
    工厂工作是细致而繁复的工作，而又是经济建设中基本的工作，对许多工厂工作者来说，这是新的须待从头学习的工作。
    两年来我们在工厂工作中摸索了不少经验，掌握了不少工厂工作中的客观的规律性，使生产量都普遍地提高了。但我们必须承认这些成绩是不够的。国家给工厂的投资是这么大，对我们的期望是这么殷切。我们工作中常出现错误，我们的教条主义者及经验主义者曾无数次或大或小地给工厂工作造成了一定的损失。我们工厂工作的同志必须认真学习“实践论”。“实践论”开辟了我们工厂工作者思想革命的道路，我们应遵循着这一条道路前进。
