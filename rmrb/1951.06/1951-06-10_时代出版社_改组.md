　　Reorganization of "Epoch Publishing House"
　　"Epoch Publishing House," which has dedicated itself to introducing Soviet culture for the past ten years, has recently been reorganized into a state-owned enterprise in our country. A board of directors composed of eleven members, including Jiang Chunfang, Feng Xuefeng, Chen Bingyi, Ye Shuifu, Xu Leiran, Wang Chengqing, Huang Luofeng, Cao Jinghua, Zhang Zhongshi, Zhang Junti, and Yao Zhen, will preside over the affairs of the publishing house. The board of directors held its first meeting in Beijing on June 2nd, during which they heard reports on the publishing house's development over the past ten years in terms of compilation, printing, publishing, distribution, personnel, and finance. They also discussed in detail the future publishing policy and the publishing plan for 1951. The meeting elected Jiang Chunfang as Chairman of the board of directors and Feng Xuefeng and Chen Bingyi as Vice-Chairmen. It was decided that the future direction of publishing work would be to introduce Soviet literary and artistic works. The two magazines, "Epoch" and "Soviet Medicine," will continue to be published, but the content of "Epoch" will be mainly to introduce Soviet literary and artistic works. The Epoch Publishing House was originally founded in Shanghai in 1941 by Soviet friends; after the liberation of Shanghai in May 1949, it was reorganized under Chinese management. In addition to the "Epoch" bi-monthly and "Soviet Medicine" monthly, which are currently being published, the publishing house has also published periodicals such as "Epoch" weekly, "Soviet Literature and Art" monthly, "Epoch Daily," Russian "Epoch" bi-monthly, and English "Soviet" weekly. Over the past ten years, the publishing house has published more than 270 kinds of Soviet literary and artistic works, social, political, economic, and popular science books, which have been well-received by Chinese readers. The "Russian-Chinese Dictionary" compiled by the publishing house has been in progress for four years. The publication of this dictionary will be of great significance for the exchange of Chinese and Soviet culture. The headquarters of the publishing house has been moved to Beijing, and the original headquarters in Shanghai has been changed to a branch office.

　　“时代出版社”改组
    十年来致力于介绍苏联文化的“时代出版社”，近已改组为我国公营企业，由姜椿芳、冯雪峰、陈冰夷、叶水夫、许磊然、王澄清、黄洛峰、曹靖华、张仲实、张君悌、姚溱等十一人组成社务委员会，主持社务。该委员会曾于六月二日在北京举行第一次会议，会上听取了关于该社十年来编译、印刷、出版、发行、干部及财务等发展情况的报告，并详细地讨论了今后的出版工作方针和一九五一年的出版计划。会议选举姜椿芳为社务委员会主席，冯雪峰、陈冰夷为副主席，并决定今后出版工作方向是介绍苏联文学艺术作品；《时代》和《苏联医学》两个杂志仍继续出版，但《时代》内容将改为以介绍苏联文艺作品为主。时代出版社原为苏联友人在一九四一年创办于上海；一九四九年五月间上海解放后，即改归中国人经营。该社除现在继续出版的《时代》半月刊和《苏联医学》月刊外，曾前后出版《时代》周刊，《苏联文艺》月刊，《时代日报》、俄文《时代》半月刊，英文《苏联》周刊等定期刊物。该社十年来出版苏联文艺作品、社会、政治、经济、通俗科学书籍共二百七十余种，颇受我国读者欢迎。该社编纂的《俄华大辞典》一种，已进行四年，此辞典的出版，对于中苏文化的交流将有很大的意义。该社总社已移至北京，原在上海的总社改为分社。
