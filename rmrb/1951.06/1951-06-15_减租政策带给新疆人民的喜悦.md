　　The Joy of Rent Reduction Policy for the People of Xinjiang
　　By our special correspondent Hu Zhong
　　Xinjiang Province is a multi-ethnic region. Is it possible to carry out social reforms such as rent reduction and anti-evil landlordism in areas where multiple ethnic groups live together? This question has been answered through the trial implementation of rent reduction work since September of last year. It is possible and necessary to carry out rent reduction in Xinjiang Province, where multiple ethnic groups live together.
            
I. “Rent Reduction is Chairman Mao’s Good Policy”

　　After the liberation of Xinjiang, the multi-ethnic democratic united Provincial People's Government and the people's governments at all levels were established. People's representative conferences at all levels were convened. In most areas of the Di Hua, Hami, Yanqi, Hotan, Shache, Kashgar, Aksu and other regions, the masses were mobilized to adjust grain, seeds, and public land, bandits were suppressed, production and construction were launched, reasonable burdens were implemented, and propaganda and education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea were carried out. The political consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups gradually increased, and farmers in many areas put forward demands for rent reduction and anti-evil landlordism. In order to cautiously and gradually launch a rent reduction movement in the agricultural areas of the entire province after the autumn harvest this year, the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees at all levels selected 19 counties including Gande, Suilai, Qitai, Changji, Mulei River, Jinghua, Fukang, Dihua, Fuyuan, Turpan, Shanshan, Toksun, Hami, Kuerle, Shufu, Aksu, Shache, Hotan, Lop Nur and 9 administrative villages in 24 townships in the suburbs of Dihua City, for a trial rent reduction. The results of the trials in various places unanimously showed that the rent reduction policy was warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Farmers in areas where rent reduction had not yet been implemented earnestly requested rent reduction work teams to come to their villages as soon as possible to lead rent reduction. They said, "Rent reduction is Chairman Mao's good policy!"
            
II. What Did the Rent Reduction Trials Prove?

　　What did the results of the rent reduction trials prove?

　　First, it proved that rent reduction can strengthen ethnic unity. Among the areas where rent reduction was trialed, except for most of the villages in southern Xinjiang where Uyghurs live, rental relations in the villages under the jurisdiction of the Dihua region mostly occurred between Uyghurs, Han, and Hui people. During rent reduction, Uyghur farmers unanimously helped Hui and Han farmers to oppose Uyghur landlords, and Hui and Han farmers also unanimously helped Uyghur farmers to oppose Hui and Han landlords. The internal unity of farmers of all ethnic groups has become more consolidated. After rent reduction in Donghu Village, Fourth Township, First District, Shanshan County, Hui farmers voluntarily lent food to Uyghur farmers who were having difficulty making a living, demonstrating a high degree of class friendship. The ethnic hatred created by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past has gradually disappeared. The farmers said, "From now on, we farmers must unite like a family."

　　Secondly, it proved that rent reduction is a necessary step to liberate the productive forces of Xinjiang farmers. Although Xinjiang has a vast territory, due to the limitation of water sources, cultivated land is only concentrated in oases. Farmers of all ethnic groups have suffered cruel exploitation by feudal forces. The general situation of land ownership is: 5 to 6 percent of the rural population, the landlords, own more than 50 percent of the land, and sometimes even 80 to 90 percent. More than 60 percent of the farmers' harvest is plundered by the landlord class. In areas with particularly high rents, farmers have to borrow money to pay rent in the event of a poor harvest. In addition to rent, landlords also universally exploit the unpaid labor of tenant farmers.

　　This feudal exploitation system has kept Xinjiang farmers in a state of poverty for a long time. In the areas where rent reduction was trialed, according to incomplete statistics, more than 390 farmers received more than 4,496 shi (each shi is 470 jin) of rent reduction benefits. The farmers all want to use the returned rent grain for production. Farmers in the Ninth Township, Saiman District, Shufu County bought two new carts, one horse, eight cows, forty-three donkeys and many plows, sickles, and "katuman" (Uyghur tools for digging soil, similar to shovels in the interior), pockets and other production tools. To Honi Yaz, a 72-year-old Uyghur man in Turpan, said excitedly after rent reduction: "Now that Chairman Mao and the People's Government have led us to reduce rents and we have fertilizer and seeds, I am more motivated to work, as if I have become young again. I want to pick up the 'katuman' again and farm with my son."

　　Thirdly, in Xinjiang, the rent reduction movement is also a fierce struggle between farmers and feudal forces. The landlord class has used various despicable means to sabotage and resist rent reduction, such as spreading rumors and buying off active farmers. Some evil landlords have even murdered peasant association cadres. Therefore, in such areas, rent reduction must also boldly mobilize the peasant masses, strengthen the peasant associations, form a broad anti-feudal united front in the countryside, and carry out an irreconcilable struggle with the feudal landlord class.

　　Fourth, rent reduction is an arduous process of mobilizing the masses and raising their class consciousness. Before the peasants are organized, they generally only hope that the government will use orders to force the landlords and rich peasants to reduce rents, and do not believe in their own strength. The experience of rent reduction trials in Xinjiang is that when publicizing the rent reduction policy, it should be combined with grievance airing and exploitation accounting to change the backward thinking of farmers who believe that their poverty is determined by "Khuda" (Uyghur: God) and to raise the class consciousness of farmers. In areas after rent reduction, the average farmer has drawn a clear line between himself and the landlord class, and they said to the landlords, "In the past it was your government, and you could increase rents at will; today it is our government, and we will implement rent reduction."
            
III. The Benefits of Chairman Mao are Endless!

　　Farmers of all ethnic groups warmly support rent reduction, and therefore, warmly support Chairman Mao. To Huti, a 50-year-old employee in the Ninth Township, Saiman District, Shufu County, said after rent reduction: "I still want to enjoy a few more years of happiness! I am now batting cotton, preparing to save some money to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao." Kuwan Ni Yaz, a hired farmhand in the Second Township, Second District, Shache County, who received 90 *cheng* (each *cheng* is 16 *jin*) of corn in the rent reduction, praised endlessly when doing "Namaz" (Uyghur: prayer) in the mosque, saying: "Our savior Communist Party, our benefactor Chairman Mao, our backer People's Government." After the rent reduction in the Xihuayuanzi Village, Hami, the farmers enthusiastically sang:

　　"Turn the trees of the world into pens,
　　Turn the rivers of the world into ink,
　　Even if everyone in the world can write,
　　The benefits of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government cannot be exhausted!"

### 减租政策带给新疆人民的喜悦

　　减租政策带给新疆人民的喜悦
    本报特约记者　胡中
    新疆省是一个多民族的地区。在民族杂居的地区是否可以进行减租反恶霸等社会改革？这个问题，经过去年九月以来的试办减租工作，已经得到了解答。在多民族杂居的新疆省进行减租是可能的，而且也是必要的。
            一、“减租是毛主席的好政策”
    新疆解放以后，各民族民主联合的省人民政府和各级人民政府建立了。各级人民代表会议召开了。迪化、哈密、焉耆、和阗、莎车、喀什、阿克苏等专区的大部分地区，发动群众调剂了粮食、种籽和公有土地，剿灭了土匪，发动了生产建设，实行了合理负担，进行了抗美援朝的宣传教育，各族人民的政治觉悟逐渐提高，不少地区的农民提出减租、反恶霸的要求。中国共产党中央新疆分局和各级党委会为了在今年秋后谨慎缓进地展开全省农业区的减租运动，选择了干德、绥来、奇台、昌吉、木垒河、景化、阜康、迪化、孚远、吐鲁番、鄯善、托克逊、哈密、库尔勒、疏附、阿克苏、莎车、和阗、洛浦等十九个县和迪化市郊共二十四个乡九个行政村，试办减租。各地试办的结果，一致说明减租政策为新疆各族人民所热烈拥护。未减租地区的农民，都恳切地要求减租工作组早日到他们村里去领导减租。他们说：“减租是毛主席的好政策！”
            二、试办减租证明了什么？
    试办减租的结果证明了什么呢？
    首先证明减租可以加强民族团结。试办减租的地区中，除南疆大部分乡村是维吾尔族聚居地区外，迪化专区所属的乡村中，租佃关系多发生在维吾尔族、汉族和回族间。在减租中，维吾尔族农民一致帮助回、汉族农民反对维吾尔族地主，回、汉族农民也一致地帮助维吾尔族农民反对回、汉族地主。各民族农民内部团结得更巩固了。鄯善县一区四乡东湖村减租后，回族农民自动借口粮给生活困难的维吾尔族农民，表现了高度的阶级友爱。过去国民党反动统治所造成的民族仇视，已逐渐消失。农民说：“今后我们农民要团结得像一家人一样。”
    其次，证明了减租是解放新疆农民生产力的一个必要的步骤。新疆虽然地域辽阔，但因水源的限制，耕地仅集中在绿洲。各族农民都受着封建势力的残酷剥削。土地占有的一般情况是：占农村人口百分之五、六的地主，占有百分之五十以上的土地，甚至有达百分之八、九十的。农民的收获有百分之六十以上被地主阶级所掠夺。在租额特别高的地区，遇到歉收，农民要借债缴付租粮。除租粮外，地主还普遍地剥削佃农的无偿劳动。
    这种封建剥削制度，使新疆农民长期处于贫困状态。在试办减租的地区，据不完全统计，有三百九十余户农民得到了四千四百九十六石（每石四百七十斤）的减租利益。农民们都要把减回的租粮用到生产上去。疏附县塞满区九乡农民新买了二辆大车，一匹马，八头牛，四十三头驴和许多犁、镰、砍土曼（维吾尔族挖土用的工具，类似内地的铁锹）、口袋等生产工具。吐鲁番七十二岁的维吾尔族老汉托乎尼牙孜在减租后兴奋地说：“现在毛主席和人民政府领导我们减了租，有了肥料种籽，我干得有了劲，好像成了年青人了。我要从新拿起砍土曼，和我儿子一起种地。”
    第三、在新疆，减租运动同样是农民和封建势力的一场激烈的斗争。地主阶级曾经用各种卑劣的手段来破坏和抗拒减租。比如散布谣言，收买积极农民等。有的恶霸地主甚至杀害过农会干部。因此，在这种地区减租，同样必须放手发动农民群众，加强农会，组成农村中广泛的反封建统一战线，和封建地主阶级进行不调和的斗争。
    第四、减租是一个艰苦的发动群众、提高群众阶级觉悟的过程。农民在没有组织起来以前，一般只希望政府用命令来迫使地主富农减租，不相信自己的力量。新疆试办减租的经验是：在宣传减租政策时，应该与诉苦运动、算剥削账相结合，以改变农民那些认为自己穷是“胡大”（维吾尔语：上帝）注定的落后思想，提高农民阶级觉悟。减租后的地区，一般农民已划清自己和地主之间的阶级界限，他们对地主说：“过去是你们的政府，你们随便加租；今天是我们的政府，我们就要实行减租。”
            三、毛主席的好处写不完！
    各族农民热烈拥护减租，因此，热烈拥护毛主席。疏附县塞满区九乡五十多岁的雇工托乎提在减租后说：“我还要享几年福呢！我现在弹棉花，准备积些钱到北京去看望毛主席。”莎车县二区二乡减租中得到九十秤（每秤十六斤）包谷的雇农库万尼牙孜在礼拜寺做“奶麻子”（维吾尔语：祈祷）时，赞不绝口地说：“我们救星共产党，我们恩人毛主席，我们靠山人民政府。”哈密西花儿园子村减租后，农民热情洋溢地歌颂着：
    “把天下的树变成笔，
    天下的河变成墨，
    即使天下的人都会写，
    毛主席、共产党和人民政府的好处也写不完！”
                                    一九五一、六、四、迪化
