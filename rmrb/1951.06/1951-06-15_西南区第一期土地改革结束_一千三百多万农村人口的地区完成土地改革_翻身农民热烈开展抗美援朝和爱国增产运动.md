　　The first phase of land reform in Southwest China concluded in May, with land reform implemented in areas with over 13 million rural population across the region. These areas include the complete counties of Changshou, Bishan, Wanxian, and Dazhu in the eastern Sichuan area, suburban districts of county cities, and parts of Kaixian, Fuling, Fengdu, Jiangbei, Beibei, and Baxian counties; the complete counties of Zizhong, Leshan, Longchang, and Rongxian in the southern Sichuan area, and part of Yibin county; fifty-five townships in ten counties including Dayi and Chongqing in the western Sichuan area; the complete counties of Nanchong, Nanbu, Santai, Suining, Yuechi, and Langzhong in the northern Sichuan area, suburban districts of Nanchong city, and one district each in Daxian, Bazhong and two other counties; the complete counties of Lushan, Ya'an, and Xichang in the Han Chinese areas of Xikang Province; one district each in the six counties of Zunyi, Anshun, Guiyang, Bijie, Zhenyuan, and Guizhu in Guizhou Province, and two districts in Qingzhen county; ten townships in counties including Kunming and Baoshan in Yunnan Province; and seven districts in suburban Chongqing. In the aforementioned areas where land reform has been implemented, the strength of the peasants has greatly developed, the feudal politics of the landlord class have been thoroughly overthrown, and the peasants' self-defense forces are maintaining social order in the countryside.

    Southwest China had many large landlords, and land was highly concentrated. In some villages, all the land was owned by landlords. Therefore, peasants in various parts of Southwest China had a very urgent need for land. In January of this year, the Second Plenary Session of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee passed the Southwest China Land Reform Plan for 1951. In February and March of this year, land reform movements began successively in various places, and in March and April, the movement reached its climax. During the movement, the broad masses of peasants in various places united to launch fierce struggles against the landlord class, crushing all resistance and sabotage by illegal landlords, and successfully realized land reform. The despotic landlords who had oppressed and bullied the peasants for many years were overthrown by the peasants. Criminals were punished by the people's courts.

    Now, in the areas where land reform has been implemented, emancipated peasants are enthusiastically launching the movement to resist America and aid Korea and the patriotic production increase movement with great enthusiasm. Peasants in the broader areas where land reform has not yet been implemented are eagerly demanding the rapid implementation of land reform. In mid-June, the second phase of land reform in Southwest China will begin. In areas with approximately 30 million rural population throughout the region, land reform will be implemented before the autumn harvest this year.

　　西南区第一期土地改革结束        
    一千三百多万农村人口的地区完成土地改革        
    翻身农民热烈开展抗美援朝和爱国增产运动
    西南区第一期土地改革已于五月结束，全区已有一千三百多万农村人口的地区实行了土地改革。这些地区包括川东区长寿、璧山、万县、大竹四个整县、县市郊区和开县、涪陵、酆都、江北、北碚、巴县六县的各一部分；川南区资中、乐山、隆昌、荣县四个整县和宜宾县的一部分；川西区大邑，崇庆等十县的五十五个乡；川北区南充、南部、三台、遂宁、岳池、阆中六个整县，南充市郊区和达县、巴中等四县的各一个区；西康省汉人地区芦山、雅安、西昌三个整县；贵州省遵义、安顺、贵阳、毕节、镇远、贵筑六个县的各一个区，清镇县的两个区；云南省昆明、保山等县的十个乡；重庆市郊的七个区。上述实行了土地改革的地区，农民的力量有很大的发展，地主阶级的封建政治已被彻底推翻，农民的自卫武装维护着农村的社会秩序。
    西南区大地主多，土地非常集中。有的乡村全部土地为地主所占有。所以西南各地农民对土地的要求非常迫切。今年一月，西南军政委员会第二次全体委员会议通过了西南区一九五一年土地改革的计划。今年二、三月间各地土地改革运动先后开始，三、四月间，运动就达到了高潮。运动中，各地广大农民团结起来，向地主阶级进行猛烈的斗争，粉碎了不法地主的一切抵抗和破坏，顺利地实现了土地改革。多少年来压在农民头上作威作福的恶霸地主，都被农民打倒了。犯罪分子受到了人民法庭的制裁。
    现在，已实行土地改革的地区，翻身农民正热情充沛地开展着抗美援朝运动和爱国增产运动。更广大的未实行土地改革地区的农民热烈要求迅速实行土地改革。本月中旬，西南区第二期土地改革即开始。全区将有三千万左右农村人口的地区，在今年秋收以前实行土地改革。
