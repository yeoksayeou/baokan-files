　　Notice from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council        
    Regarding the Strict Inspection of Basic Construction Project Designs

    Starting from June 16th, the People's Daily has continuously published several pieces of information illustrating the serious problem of blindly proceeding with construction in basic construction projects without correct engineering designs. The People's Daily also published an editorial on the 16th, "Construction is Impossible Without Engineering Design," analyzing the ideological roots of this erroneous behavior. Some of the aforementioned information is relatively old and has been corrected, but even this earlier information still holds significant educational value for the various basic construction projects we are currently undertaking.

    In order to prevent and overcome blindness in basic construction, the Government Administration Council made a decision in December 1950. The Financial and Economic Committee's Industrial Conference also held a special discussion in February of this year, and the Financial and Economic Committee issued a notice in March on the issue of basic construction procedures, all resolutely opposing the phenomenon of commencing construction without thorough engineering design. Generally, progress has been made in implementing the above decisions in various regions. However, violations of the above decisions still exist seriously. This is extremely detrimental to basic construction. Therefore, all levels of enterprises and municipal construction management departments, factories, mines, and businesses across the country are hereby ordered to discuss the aforementioned information and editorial from the People's Daily and conduct an in-depth inspection of the status of basic construction projects in their respective departments to gain experience. During the inspection, any instances found to be in violation of basic construction regulations should be rectified immediately. Important cases should be reported to this Committee, and the main responsible personnel should conduct self-criticisms, which should be published in the People's Daily and local newspapers. Trade union organizations at all levels should provide assistance in this regard. The aforementioned discussions and inspections should be completed before the end of July. During this comprehensive inspection, the idea that "any basic construction must have a prudent and correct design before construction" should be clearly established, and this idea should be implemented in practical action.
                                                  June 19th

### 政务院财政经济委员会  关于严格检查基本建设工程设计的通知

　　政务院财政经济委员会        
    关于严格检查基本建设工程设计的通知
    人民日报自六月十六日起，连续发表了几个资料，说明在基本建设中，没有正确的工程设计，即行盲目施工的现象是很严重的。人民日报并于十六日发表了一篇《没有工程设计就不可能施工》的社论，分析了这种错误行为的思想根源。上述资料，有些是比较早的，并且得到纠正的，但就是这些较早的资料，对于我们今天正在进行的各种基本建设来说，仍然有重大的教育意义。
    为了防止和克服基本建设中的盲目性，政务院曾于一九五○年十二月作出决定，今年二月财政经济委员会工业会议曾作专门讨论，三月财政经济委员会亦曾就基本建设程序问题发出通知，均坚决反对不经过周密的工程设计即行施工的现象。各地在执行上述决定时，一般已有成绩。但违反上述决定的现象，仍然严重地存在。这对于基本建设是极端不利的。为此，特通令全国各级企业及市政建设管理部门、各工厂、矿山和企业，必须一律对人民日报上述资料和社论加以讨论，并对各部门的基本建设工程状况加以深入的检查，以取得经验。在检查中，凡发现不合基本建设规程者，应即设法纠正，其中重要者应报告本委，其主要负责人员则应作检讨，分别在人民日报及各地报上公布。各级工会组织对此应加以协助。上述讨论和检查，应于七月底以前完成。在这一普遍的检查中，应明确地建立“任何基本建设必须有慎重的正确的设计然后施工”这样的思想，并且把这种思想贯彻到实际行动中去。
                                                  六月十九日
