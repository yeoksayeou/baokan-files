　　After the implementation of land reform and rent reduction in the vast rural areas of northern Sichuan, the number of rural elementary schools and students has greatly increased. According to statistics from the Department of Culture and Education of the Northern Sichuan People's Administrative Office, there are 15,622 elementary schools in the region this spring, double the number from the previous semester; the number of students has reached 1,197,600, an increase of 242 percent compared to the previous semester. In many villages, under the leadership of the Farmers' Association, farmers have allocated a portion of their gains from rent reduction and land reform to establish schools. This spring, farmers in Jiange County allocated 960,000 catties of rice from their gains to establish 318 elementary schools, giving 65 percent of school-age children in the county the opportunity to attend school.

　　In rural areas where land reform has been completed, an unprecedented upsurge in school establishment has been created. Farmers in more than 20 villages in Suining and other places have voluntarily built school buildings, added school equipment, and sent representatives to the county people's government to request the assignment of teachers. Suining County has now achieved one school per village. Farmers everywhere are very happy to send their children to school. Zhou Zhongju, a farmer from the Third Village of Taiyi Township, Shehong County, whose family had not held a book for several generations, also sent his two sons to school this year. Currently, among the 15,622 elementary schools in the Northern Sichuan region, more than 13,900 are run by the people. These schools alone can accommodate 600,000 students.

　　While farmers in various places are actively establishing schools, people's governments at all levels have sent cadres to the countryside to assist farmers in organizing township and village elementary school civil administration committees, enabling the work of civil administration elementary schools to be carried out smoothly. At the same time, the Northern Sichuan People's Administrative Office has added many short-term teacher training classes in the normal schools of various special districts to train rural teachers.

　　川北农民大量兴办小学
    川北广大农村在实行土地改革和减租后，农村小学校和学生人数大大增加。据川北人民行政公署文教厅统计：今春全区共有小学校一万五千六百二十二所，较去年下学期增加了一倍；学生达一百十九万七千六百余人，较去年下学期增加了百分之二百四十二。许多乡村的农民，在农民协会领导下，从减租和土地改革所得的胜利果实中，抽出一部分资财兴办学校。剑阁县农民今春就从胜利果实中抽出大米九十六万斤，办了三百十八所小学，使该县百分之六十五的学龄儿童有机会进学校读书。
    在土地改革已经完成的农村，更造成了空前未有的兴办学校的热潮。遂宁等地二十多个村庄的农民都自动建筑校舍、添设校具，并派代表到县人民政府请求委派教师。现遂宁县已做到一村一校。各地农民非常高兴地把自己的子弟送入学校。射洪县太乙乡第三村农民周忠举，他家好几代没有人拿过书本，今年也送他的两个儿子上学了。目前川北区的一万五千六百二十二所小学中，民办小学有一万三千九百余所。仅这些民办的小学就可以容纳六十万学生。
    在各地农民积极兴办学校中，各级人民政府曾派干部下乡协助农民组织乡、村小学民办教育委员会，使民办小学的工作得以顺利推行。同时川北人民行政公署在各专区的师范学校内，增设了不少短期师资训练班，训练乡村教师。
