Responding to the Government's Call to Sell and Store Cotton
By Lao Ding and Chen Jinyan

　　(19) The American devils invaded Korea, and the whole country should resist America and aid Korea. Wang Quanfu's family all donated money and wrote letters of condolence to the Volunteer Army. Hearing that the American devils were going to arm Japanese imperialism again, they all signed their names in opposition, so as to prevent the murderous devils from coming to devastate the common people again.

　　(20) At the beginning of June this year, the government put forward the call to sell and store cotton. The district head said at the meeting: "When drinking water, one must think of its source. Everyone should think about it, without Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the victory of the revolution led by the working class, and land reform, where would we be today? We must sell or store the cotton we have to the country, so that the yarn factories can continue to operate. Workers have jobs, and frontline soldiers have clothes to wear, which both protects the country and stabilizes society. The government also stipulates that the cotton sold and stored will be guaranteed in value, which is beneficial to both the country and ourselves."

　　(21) After the meeting, at the Wang Quanfu mutual aid group meeting, branch secretary Comrade Li Jiaren said: "Our peasants must respond to the government's call for the movement to sell and store cotton to the state. This is a very important manifestation of our patriotism." Everyone then made a patriotic pact, guaranteeing to sell or store the surplus cotton to the state.

　　响应政府售棉储棉的号召
　　劳丁　陈今言作
　　（十九）美国鬼子侵略朝鲜，全国都要抗美援朝，王全福一家都捐了钱，并且写了慰问信给志愿军。听说美国鬼子又要武装日本帝国主义，他们又都签名反对，为的是别再让杀人的鬼子又来糟塌老百姓。
　　（二十）今年六月初政府提出了售棉储棉的号召。区长在大会上说：“饮水要思源。大家想一想，没有毛主席、共产党和工人阶级领导的革命胜利、土地改革，我们那有今天的生活。我们一定要把存棉卖给或储存给国家，使纱厂继续开工。工人有工作，前方战士有衣穿，既保卫国家，又安定社会。政府又规定售储的棉花保本保值，对国家对自己都有利。”
　　（二十一）散会后，在王全福互助小组会上，支部书记李家仁同志发言说：“咱们农民要响应政府的售棉储棉运动的号召，将棉花售储给国家，这就是我们很重要的爱国表现”。大家随即订了爱国公约，保证将存棉卖给或储给国家。
