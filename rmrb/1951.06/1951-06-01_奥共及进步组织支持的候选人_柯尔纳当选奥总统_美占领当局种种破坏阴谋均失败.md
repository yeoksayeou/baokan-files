　　Xinhua News Agency, Vienna Dispatch: According to a TASS report from Vienna, Körner, the Socialist Party candidate and Mayor of Vienna, supported by the Communist Party and other progressive organizations, has been elected President of Austria in the Austrian presidential election held on May 28th. According to preliminary statistics released by the Austrian Central Election Commission, a total of 4,365,127 people participated in the election. Körner received 2,172,806 votes, while the "People's Party" candidate, Gleissner, who was actively supported by the U.S. occupation authorities, received 2,004,290 votes.

　　Since the death of the former Austrian President Renner on December 30th last year, the ruling People's Party and Socialist Party, unable to agree on a common presidential candidate, had to abandon their original plan to elect the president by parliament. In January of this year, the parliament decided to elect a new president by universal suffrage. However, the results of the election held on May 7th showed that no candidate obtained the absolute majority required for election. Therefore, a second election was held on the 28th. Both elections proved the failure of U.S. imperialism to interfere in Austria's internal affairs.

　　During the first election, the U.S. occupation authorities and Austrian reactionaries used all kinds of terrorist means to try to prevent the people from electing the left-wing group's candidate, Communist Party member Fiala. By the second election, they became even more unscrupulous in threatening voters, forcing them to elect the "People's Party" candidate Gleissner, who faithfully served U.S. interests, and even dispatched thugs to attack workers who opposed Gleissner's election. The U.S. occupation authorities also allocated 6 million schillings (Austrian currency) to Gleissner's campaign, but as a result, Gleissner still failed to be elected.

### 奥共及进步组织支持的候选人  柯尔纳当选奥总统  美占领当局种种破坏阴谋均失败

　　奥共及进步组织支持的候选人
    柯尔纳当选奥总统
    美占领当局种种破坏阴谋均失败
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：在五月二十八日奥地利举行的总统选举中，为共产党及其他进步组织所支持的社会党候选人、维也纳市长柯尔纳，已当选为奥地利总统。据奥地利中央选举委员会所公布的初步统计：参加选举的共有四百三十六万五千一百二十七人，柯尔纳获得二百十七万二千八百零六票，而为美国占领当局所积极支持的“人民党”候选人葛莱斯纳，则获得二百万四千二百九十票。
    自从奥地利前总统伦纳在去年十二月三十日逝世以后，执政的人民党和社会党由于不能协议提出一个共同的总统候选人，不得不放弃它们原来由议会选举总统的计划，而在今年一月由议会决定用普选的方法选举新总统。但是五月七日举行选举的结果，没有一个候选人获得当选必需的绝对多数。因此二十八日又举行了第二次选举。两次选举都证明了美帝国主义干涉奥地利内政的失败。
    在第一次选举时，美国占领当局与奥地利反动派即曾使用一切恐怖手段，竭力阻挠人民选举左翼集团的候选人共产党议员费亚拉。到第二次选举时，他们更加肆无忌惮地威吓选民，强迫他们选举忠实为美国利益服务的“人民党”候选人葛莱斯纳，甚至出动打手向反对选举葛莱斯纳的工人进攻。美国占领当局还拨出了六百万先令（奥币）给葛莱斯纳竞选，但是结果葛莱斯纳竟还是落选。
