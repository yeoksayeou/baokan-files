　　Cotton Farmers in Huajiazhai, Xianyang
　  Decide to Sell All Stored Cotton to the State
    After learning that the Central People's Government's State Council called on farmers to launch a patriotic cotton selling and storage campaign, cotton farmers in Huajiazhai, Sixth District, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, immediately held discussions and decided to sell all their stored cotton, totaling more than 800 jin, to the state. During the discussion, Qu Zengzhi, chairman of the village farmers' association, said: "All households in our village with stored cotton should actively respond to the government's call to sell and store cotton for the country, and use this patriotic action to answer the American imperialist 'blockade.'" Qu Zengde, leader of the cooperative members' group, said: "I will sell all 50 jin of my stored cotton to the state. The government, in order to reward us for growing cotton, stipulated that one jin of cotton can be exchanged for eight jin of wheat, and also provided loans for fertilizer and advance purchases of cotton to help us grow more cotton and increase production. Now the state is calling on us to sell cotton, which is beneficial to ourselves and to the country. The workers and us are brothers, cotton cannot be stored at home for long, selling it to the state allows workers to produce, and the military and civilians have clothes to wear." The other six farmers who had stored cotton also expressed their willingness to sell their 155 jin of cotton to the state.
    Note: Xianyang County is one of the cotton producing areas in Guanzhong. Last winter, the farmers of Huajiazhai stored more than 800 jin of cotton. Because it is now the wheat harvesting season, the cotton farmers in the village decided to deliver all their stored cotton to the purchasing agency after the wheat harvest is completed.

　　咸阳华家寨棉农
　  决定将全部存棉卖给国家
    陕西省咸阳县第六区华家寨棉农在知道中央人民政府政务院号召农民展开爱国主义的售棉、储棉运动后，立刻进行讨论，决定把所存八百多斤棉花全部卖给国家。在讨论中，村农会主席屈增智说：“我们全村存棉户，应当积极响应政府号召，向国家卖棉花、储棉花，拿这一爱国行动来回答美帝国主义的‘封锁’。”合作社社员组长屈增德说：“我要把五十斤存棉统统卖给国家。政府为了奖励我们种棉花，规定一斤花换八斤麦，还贷放肥料，预购棉花，帮助我们多种棉花，增加产量。现在国家号召我们卖棉花，这对自己有利，对国家也有利。工人和咱们是兄弟，棉花放在家里长不了，卖给国家，工人能生产，军民有衣穿。”其他六个存棉花的农民当下也表示要把他们存的一百五十五斤棉花卖给国家。
    按：咸阳县为关中棉产区之一。华家寨农民去冬共存棉八百多斤。因为现在正是收麦时节，该村棉农决定在麦收完毕后即将全部存棉送交收购机关。
