Xinhua News Agency, June 5th. To celebrate the upcoming opening of the Sino-German Friendship Month in Berlin, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, held a cocktail party here tonight to mark the occasion.

Königs, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China with the rank of Ambassador, was invited to attend.

Also present were Chen Shutong, Ma Xulun, Shen Yanbing, Xu Deheng, Wu Xiuquan, Xu Baoju and other guests from all walks of life, as well as Soviet and other People's Democratic countries' envoys to China, totaling over one hundred people.

In his speech at the gathering, Chairman Guo Moruo pointed out that the births of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China at almost the same time can be said to be a turning point in world history. The existence of People's China and Democratic Germany, side by side with the great fortress of peace, the Soviet Union, has brought about a fundamental change in the balance of power between the aggressive camp and the peace camp, making the imperialist plot to enslave all mankind impossible. He then pointed out that U.S. imperialism is attempting to arm West Germany and Japan, and the Chinese and German peoples are currently at the forefront of defending world peace on the eastern and western flanks. Therefore, strengthening the friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and German peoples is indeed of paramount importance. The Chinese and German peoples should take the Sino-German Friendship Month as a starting point, strengthen ties, exchange experiences, learn from each other, in order to complete the mission of building their own countries and the common mission of defending world peace.

In his speech, Ambassador Königs pointed out that the Chinese people's historic victory, their movement to resist America and aid Korea, the movement against the rearmament of Japan, and the recent great achievement of the peaceful liberation of Tibet have all given the German people valuable experience, which is of great importance to the German people's struggle against the rearmament of West Germany, for German unification, and for lasting peace. Sino-German Friendship Month will further strengthen the power of the invincible camp of peace.

The banquet proceeded in a warm atmosphere. After the banquet, films of the German Democratic Republic, "Leipzig Fair" and "Semmelweis—Savior of Mothers," were screened.

[Report from this newspaper] Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, sent a cable to the "Sino-German Friendship Month" conference, expressing his congratulations. The original cable is as follows:
To the "Sino-German Friendship Month" Conference:

On the opening of the "Sino-German Friendship Month," I extend my warm congratulations to the conference on behalf of the entire peace-loving people of China with infinite excitement. China and Germany are two major members of the powerful peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. The increasing friendship between the peoples of China and Germany will surely make great contributions to the cause of defending world lasting peace. May the fraternal and unbreakable friendship between the two peoples last forever.

　　德中友好月即将在柏林揭幕
    郭沫若昨在京举行酒会志贺
    并致电祝贺两国人民友谊日益增进
    【新华社五日讯】为了庆祝德中友好月即将在柏林揭幕，中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若特于今晚在此间举行酒会志贺。
    德意志民主共和国驻中国外交使团大使衔团长柯尼希应邀出席。
    到会者并有陈叔通、马叙伦、沈雁冰、许德珩、伍修权、许宝驹等各界来宾暨苏联及各人民民主国家驻华使节等一百余人。
    郭沫若主席在会上致词时指出，德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国的差不多同时诞生，可以说是世界历史的转折点。有人民中国和民主德国，与伟大的和平堡垒苏联并肩存在，这使侵略阵营与和平阵营的力量对比起了基本上的变化，使世界帝国主义奴役全人类的侵略企图要成为不可能了。他接着指出：美帝国主义正在企图武装西德和日本，中德两国人民目前处在保卫世界和平的东西两翼的最前线。因此，加强中德两国人民的友谊团结，的确具有头等重要的意义。中德两国人民应以德中友好月为起点，加强联系，交流经验，相互学习，以完成建设自己国家的使命和保卫世界和平的共同的使命。
    柯尼希团长在致词时指出，中国人民的历史性的胜利，他们的抗美援朝运动，反对武装日本运动，以及最近和平解放西藏的伟大成就，都给了德国人民以极有价值的经验，这些经验对于德国人民反对武装西德、争取德国统一和争取持久和平的斗争，起了重要的作用。德中友好月将更加加强不可战胜的和平阵营的力量。
    宴会在热烈气氛中进行。会后并放映德意志民主共和国的电影《来比锡博览会》和《森美耳维司—母亲们的救星》。
    【本报讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若致电“德中友好月”大会，表示祝贺。原电如下：“德中友好月”大会：
    “德中友好月”开幕，我以无限兴奋的心情，代表全中国爱好和平的人民，向大会致以热烈的祝贺。中德两国是以苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营中的两大成员、中德两国人民友谊的日益增进，在保卫世界持久和平的事业中，必将有很大贡献。祝两国人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊万岁。
              中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
