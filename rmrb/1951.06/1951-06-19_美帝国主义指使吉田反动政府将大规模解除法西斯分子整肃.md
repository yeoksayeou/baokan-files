　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The long-conspired plan by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to largely lift the purges of Japanese militarists is about to be implemented. With the support of the U.S. Occupation Headquarters, the reactionary Yoshida government decided on two ordinances regarding the lifting of purges against militarists at the cabinet meeting on the 15th and announced their implementation on the same day. One ordinance is to revise the purge order, relaxing the original provisions prohibiting those purged from holding public office and expanding the scope of revocation of the original purges. Personnel from local branches of wartime fascist organizations such as the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" and the "Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society," fascists in the economic and commentary circles, Diet members recommended by Tojo, members of the Veterans Association, and members of the fascist organization "Butokukai," who were previously listed for purge, will all be removed from the scope of the purge. The other ordinance is to establish a committee to re-examine the list of those purged in order to lift their purge punishments on a large scale. The first list of those who will be de-purged under these two ordinances will be announced within days, totaling approximately 70,000 people.
　　At the same time, the U.S. Occupation Headquarters in Japan formally notified the Yoshida government on the 16th to revoke the 1946 U.S. military headquarters memorandum on the purge of 73 important fascists in the Japanese political and financial circles. These 73 people include Ichiro Hatoyama, former president of the Democratic Liberal Party (the predecessor of the Liberal Party), Tanzan Ishibashi, former Minister of Finance, and Jotaro Kawakami, former Secretary-General of the "Imperial Rule Assistance Association," and others.

　　美帝国主义指使吉田反动政府将大规模解除法西斯分子整肃
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：美日反动派密谋已久的大规模解除日本军国主义分子的整肃的计划，即将开始实行。吉田反动政府在美国占领军总部的支持下，在十五日的内阁会议中决定了两项关于对军国主义分子解除整肃的法令，并于当日公布实施。一项法令是修改整肃令，放宽原来禁止被整肃者担任公职的规定，将扩大撤销原先的整肃范围。以前被列入整肃之列的“大政翼赞会”、“翼赞政治会”等战时法西斯团体的地方支部的人员，经济界和评论界的法西斯分子、东条推荐的议员、在乡军人会会员、法西斯团体“武德会”会员等，都将被从整肃范围内撤销。另一项法令是设置一个委员会，重新审查被整肃者的名单，以便大批解除他们的整肃处分。第一批根据这两项法令被解除整肃者的名单，日内即将发表，人数共约七万名。
    同时，美国驻日占领军总部在十六日正式照会吉田政府，撤销一九四六年美军总部关于整肃日本政界和财界重要法西斯分子七十三人的备忘录。这七十三人中包括前民主自由党（自由党的前身）总裁鸠山一郎、前藏相（财政大臣）石桥湛山、前“大政翼赞会”总务河上丈太郎等。
