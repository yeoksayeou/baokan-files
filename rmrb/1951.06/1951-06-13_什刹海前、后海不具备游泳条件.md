　　Shichahai (Front and Back Lakes) Not Suitable for Swimming

To the Editor:

　　On the evening of June 1st, An Hongyuan, a physical education teacher from Wudinghou Elementary School in this city, drowned while swimming in Shichahai after violating regulations by going into the water while boating. Neither the front nor back lakes of Shichahai are suitable for swimming. There is a lot of seaweed on the bottom of the lake. Judging from the shape of the drowned body, An Hongyuan was entangled by seaweed and drowned. In addition, students and children often stand on the shore trying to catch fish, which is also extremely dangerous. We hope that parents who take their children to play there and residents nearby will pay more attention to and educate their children.

### 什刹海前、后海不具备游泳条件

　　什刹海前、后海不具备游泳条件编辑同志：
    六月一日晚，有本市武定侯小学体育教员安洪元在什刹海划船时违章下水游泳，竟被淹死。什刹海前后两海都不具备游泳条件，海底水草很多，从淹死的尸身形状可以看出，安洪元是被水草缠住以致被水淹死的。此外常常有些学生和小孩子，好站在海岸伸手捉鱼，这也是极危险的事，希望带小孩去玩和附近住户的家长们，特别对小朋友们加强照料和教育。
