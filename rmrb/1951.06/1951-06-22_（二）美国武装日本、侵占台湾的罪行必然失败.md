　　(II) The U.S. Crime of Arming Japan and Occupying Taiwan is Bound to Fail
    The United States is openly accelerating its illegal actions to rearm Japan, and at the same time, it is more blatantly persisting in its occupation of our territory, Taiwan. The reason why the United States is doing this is, on the one hand, to show that the United States is attempting to further expand its war of aggression, and on the other hand, to show that the United States' failure on the Korean battlefield is becoming increasingly obvious.
    It is clear that after suffering repeated serious setbacks in Korea, the United States aggressors have suffered increasingly heavy casualties, and the United States is in an increasingly serious predicament of being stretched thin. Therefore, the United States is eager to use Japanese soldiers to supplement its combat power. According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the American and Japanese reactionaries are actively preparing to establish a "U.S.-Japan Joint Military Committee" to be responsible for carrying out the criminal plan of rearming the Japanese army and implementing U.S.-Japan "military cooperation." The so-called U.S.-Japan "military cooperation" is actually a plan by the United States to tie Japan to the U.S. chariot to expand its war of aggression. The United States cannot even wait for the realization of the separate peace treaty with Japan conspiracy, and is rushing to engage in "military cooperation," which fully reflects the United States' impatience. After U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall "inspected" Korea on the 8th of this month, he ordered the Yoshida government in Tokyo on the 11th to step up the field training of the Japanese police reserve force, the purpose of which is even more obvious.
    Related to this are other war steps taken by the United States in Japan. The United States is accelerating the implementation of a policy to militarize Japanese industry in Japan, and is preparing to further massively lift the purges of Japanese militarist elements, so as to make Japan embark on the road of re-militarization faster in the economic and political fields. On May 16, Marquette, director of the Economic and Scientific Bureau of the U.S. Occupation Forces Headquarters in Japan, publicly issued a statement on the rapid establishment of a "U.S.-Japan Economic Partnership System." This so-called U.S.-Japan "Economic Partnership System" is in fact a plan to incorporate the Japanese economy into the U.S. war economic system, so as to make Japan a U.S. arsenal in the Far East. The lifting of the purges of Japanese militarist elements is to strengthen Japan's fascist rule and use them to carry out aggressive activities in Asia, especially to employ former Japanese soldiers among them as officers and cadres of the rearmed Japanese fascist army.
    The United States' deliberate occupation of Taiwan is now admitted by itself. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State Rusk, and U.S. Secretary of Defense Marshall and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley have all recently stated publicly that "the established U.S. policy is not to give Taiwan to Communist China" and that "there is an obligation to use military force to achieve this goal." The "Policy Directive on Propaganda Concerning the Taiwan Question" issued by the U.S. Department of State on December 23, 1949, fully exposes the U.S. conspiracy to invade Taiwan. However, in the past, the U.S. government and its propaganda tools have always denied this conspiracy. Now, the facts force U.S. imperialism to admit that it is not only a robber but also a liar.
    China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asian countries resolutely oppose the U.S. plan for a separate peace treaty with Japan and the rearming of Japan. The Chinese people and all governments and peoples that recognize international justice resolutely oppose the U.S. crime of plundering our territory, Taiwan. The U.S. openly and shamelessly carries out the collusion of rearming Japan and occupying Taiwan, and the result will inevitably be a tragic failure.

### （二）美国武装日本、侵占台湾的罪行必然失败

　　（二）美国武装日本、侵占台湾的罪行必然失败
    美国正在公开地加速重新武装日本的非法行动，同时也更露骨地坚持侵占我国领土台湾。美国之所以这样作，一方面显示美国企图进一步扩大侵略战争，同时也显示，美国在朝鲜战场的失败，已日益明显。
    很显然，美国侵略者在朝鲜迭次遭受严重挫败之后，伤亡日益惨重，美国已处于力不从心日益严重的窘况。因此，美国便亟于使用日本兵，以补充它的作战力量。据新华社十九日的报道，美日反动派正在积极筹备成立“美日联合军事委员会”，以负责进行重新武装日本军队、实行美日“军事合作”的罪恶计划。所谓美日“军事合作”，实际上是美国把日本拴在美国战车上的扩大侵略战争的计划。美国现在已等不到单独对日媾和阴谋的实现，就急急忙忙来搞“军事合作”了，这充分反映美国那种迫不及待的心情。本月八日美国国防部长马歇尔到朝鲜“视察”之后，于十一日就在东京命令吉田政府加紧日本警察后备队的野战训练，其目的更是显而易见的。
    与此相联的，是美国在日本实施的其他方面的战争步骤。美国正在日本加速实行使日本工业军事化的政策，并准备进一步大规模地解除日本军国主义分子的整肃，以便在经济和政治上使日本更快地走上重新军国主义化的道路。五月十六日美国驻日占领军总部经济科学局局长马贵特，更公开发表了迅速建立“美日经济提携体制”的声明。这个所谓美日“经济提携体制”，事实上是把日本经济编入美国战争经济体制的计划，以便使日本成为美国在远东的兵工厂。而解除日本军国主义分子的整肃，则是为了要加强日本的法西斯统治，并利用他们在亚洲进行侵略活动，尤其是要引用其中的日本旧军人充当美国重新武装起来的日本法西斯军队的军官干部。
    美国蓄意侵占台湾，现在也自己供认出来了。美国国务卿艾奇逊、助理国务卿鲁克斯及美国国防部长马歇尔和参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷等人，最近都曾公开声言：“美国既定政策是不把台湾给共产党中国”，“并有义务使用军事力量达到这个目的”。美国国务院于一九四九年十二月二十三日发出的“关于台湾问题的宣传政策指示”，对于美国侵略台湾的阴谋，更是暴露无遗。但是，在以前，美国政府和它的宣传工具一直是否认这个阴谋的，现在，事实逼得美帝国主义不能不承认：自己不但是强盗而且是骗子。
    中苏两国和亚洲各国人民，坚决反对美国单独对日媾和、重新武装日本的计划。中国人民和一切承认国际正义的政府和人民，坚决反对美国掠夺我国领土台湾的罪行。美国公开地无耻地进行重新武装日本和侵占台湾的勾当，结果必然是悲惨的失败。
