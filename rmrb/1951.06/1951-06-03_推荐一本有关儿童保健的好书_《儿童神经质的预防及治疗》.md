　　Recommending a Good Book on Child Health Care: "Prevention and Treatment of Childhood Neurosis"
    Written by Simsun, translated by Zhu Binsheng, published by Times Publishing House.
    This book is a small booklet from the Soviet Union that promotes health knowledge. It is only sixty-some pages long and the content is not difficult to understand. It mainly discusses children's "mental hygiene," and the viewpoints are very new. Not only is it extremely beneficial for parents to read, but also for people who generally lack knowledge of mental hygiene, people who have some neurotic problems themselves (such as neurasthenia), and general medical workers, they will all gain something from reading it.
    The old medical viewpoint has created a wrong hygiene concept for us, which is to passively emphasize avoiding various stimuli that are detrimental to the body (such as cold, heat, noise, indigestible food, etc.). This book, however, is permeated with a positive spirit, pointing out: it is necessary to cultivate children's tolerance to various adverse stimuli. For example, when sleeping, children should be accustomed to "falling asleep under any different conditions." This is a good example of bringing the robust character of the working class into science. Children raised in this spirit will not be too delicate or too weak.
    This book also tells us: Do not cause children to "overly pay attention to their own physical sensations." Children easily accept suggestion. If they often hear people talking about heart disease, they will also worry about their own heart and will also imitate adults by taking their own pulse and calculating their heart rate. Some therefore feel discomfort in their heart, even pain, even pain to the point of demanding that adults call an ambulance and send them to the hospital immediately. When children make such a fuss, adults should tell them: "These phenomena are absolutely harmless to health and will not endanger life." When children see that their parents' attitude is calm, "they will gradually become unresponsive to their own feelings and eventually forget them." The book repeatedly says: "Ignoring such neurotic phenomena is the most effective method of prevention." If adults pay attention to them and ask about them, children will regard their feelings as "evidence of illness," and create illness where there is none. Doctors in bourgeois countries are very generous in giving people this kind of "evidence," guiding people to constantly pay attention to the "slight discomfort" in their bodies, causing a large number of people to live a semi-sick life mentally.
    This book criticizes the bourgeois medical view that neurosis is determined by heredity and points out that it is mainly caused by external factors. The family is the child's "world," so the external influences they receive are mainly the influence of their parents. Parents must pay attention to "cultivating children's determination, fortitude, and courage." It is necessary to value the child's gradually increasing "desire for autonomy" and intentionally cultivate its development. If adults hinder the development of children's autonomy, the child "will become timid, afraid of things, and hesitant after growing up. He will never fully taste the joy of creative endeavors." Or it will cause the child's stubbornness. No matter what adults ask him to do, he always says "No! No!" a problem of refusing all requests and teachings.
    This book also points out: When treating children, children should be educated to have confidence and will to overcome the disease. If a child stutters, he should be "told that temporary stuttering is common among children and will definitely get better." Tell him to speak as slowly as possible, encourage him to speak more, and express confidence that he will be able to correct this problem.
    In addition, this book also emphasizes the good effect of collective life on children's mental health, and explains the harm of using corporal punishment and intimidation on children, etc. In short, this booklet is very rich and useful, and it is worth reading for everyone who cares about the health of children.

　　推荐一本有关儿童保健的好书  《儿童神经质的预防及治疗》
    西姆松著朱滨生译时代出版社版
    这本书是苏联宣传卫生常识的一本小册子，薄薄的六十几面，内容也不难懂，讲的主要是儿童的“心理卫生”，观点很新，不仅作父母的看了有极大好处，就是一般缺乏心理卫生常识的人，自己有点神经性毛病儿（如神经衰弱）的人，以及一般医务工作者，看了都会有所得的。
    旧的医学观点给我们造成一种错误的卫生观念，就是消极地强调避免各种对身体不利的刺戟（如冷、热、骚音、不易消化的食物等等）。这本书却贯穿着一种积极的精神，指出了：要养成儿童对各种不利刺戟的忍受性。比如睡觉，要使小孩习惯“在任何不同条件下入睡”，这是把工人阶级的刚健性格带进科学中的好例子。按这种精神培养大的孩子就不至于太娇、太弱。
    这本书还告诉我们：不要引起小孩“过份注意自己肉体感觉”。小孩很容易接受暗示，如果常常听到人家说心脏病，他也就会耽心自己的心脏，也会学大人的样子自己按脉，计算心跳次数。有的因此觉得心脏难受，甚至疼痛，甚至痛得要求大人叫救护车，马上送他上医院。孩子们这样闹的时候，大人就应告诉他：“这些现象绝对无碍健康，也不会危及生命的。”孩子见到家长态度冷静，“他们也就对于自己的感觉渐渐的不起反应而终于淡忘了。”这本书再三说到：“对于这类神经性现象不事过问，乃是最有效力的防止方法。”大人如果注意他，过问他，小孩就会把他的感觉看成“有了病的证据”，没病闹成有病。资产阶级国家的医生就很慷慨地给人这种“证据”，引导人家常常注意自己身体上的“轻微的不舒服”，使大批的人精神上老是过着半病人的生活。
    这本书批判了资产阶级医学把神经质看成遗传质所决定的说法，指出了这主要是外界的原因造成的。家庭是小孩的“世界”，所以他们所受的外界影响，主要就是父母的影响。做父母的一定要注意“养成儿童的坚决、刚强和勇敢。”要重视小孩逐渐增强的“自主的要求”，并且有意地培养它发展。大人如果妨碍小孩自主性的发展，小孩“长大之后，他会变成胆小、怕事和迟疑不决。他永远不会完全尝到创造事业的快乐。”或是造成小孩子的固执，大人叫他干什么，他总是叫“不要！不要！”拒绝一切要求、教训的毛病。
    这本书还指出了：给小孩治病的时候，应该教育小孩要有克服疾病的信心和意志。有的小孩口吃，就要“告诉他，暂时的口吃是孩子们常有的事，并且一定会好的。”叫他说话尽量慢一点，鼓励他多说话，表示相信他一定能把这个毛病矫正过来。
    此外，这本书还强调了集体生活对于小孩精神上的良好作用，说明了对小孩用体罚、用恐吓的害处等等。总之，这本小册子内容非常丰富有用，值得每一个关心孩子们健康的人一读。
