　　Volunteer Army Returning Representatives in North China
　　From the end of March to late May, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to China, Gao Chao, Wang Jianhun, and Li Jitao, visited Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Taigu, Yangquan, Xinxiang, Anyang, Xuanhua, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Guihua, Baotou and other cities in North China, giving 64 reports to over 616,000 people. Wherever the representatives went, the welcoming crowds were very large. Xuanhua's entire population was only 30,000, but the number of people welcoming the representatives reached 20,000. In Datong, 50,000 people lined the streets to welcome the representatives. People scrambled to throw flowers, present flowers, present banners, and present gifts to the representatives. In Taiyuan, the jeeps carrying the representatives were filled with gifts presented by compatriots along the way. In various places in Chahar and Suiyuan, people carried the representatives around, embracing them warmly and reverently presenting them with banners and gifts. Many considered it a supreme honor to carry a representative once or shake hands with them. When the representatives traveled from Zhangjiakou to Datong, people in Tianzhen, Luowenzao, Yanggao, and other places along the way stood in the rain waiting to greet and send them off. In Yanggao, the Volunteer Army representatives advised the crowds who were seeing them off in the rain to go back early, but they replied, "You could endure crawling through ice and snow on the Korean front, what does this little bit of rain count for?" In Shijiazhuang, labor models from factories personally gave their own medals to the Volunteer Army returning representatives. Farmers in many areas presented their precious local products. Some women presented eggs with paper flowers pasted on them. A farmer from Yanggao County traveled 120 li to Datong specifically to present grapes to the representatives.
　　The over 616,000 people who directly heard the reports of the Volunteer Army representatives, and the millions who listened to the broadcasts, expressed their infinite gratitude and respect for the vivid deeds of the Volunteer Army's heroic struggle recounted by the representatives. At the same time, they felt infinite resentment towards the various bestial crimes of American imperialism in Korea.
　　"If the Volunteer Army hadn't gone abroad, the American bandits would have attacked our doorstep long ago," "Resolutely resist America, aid Korea, support the Korean front, and not allow the evil deeds of American imperialism in Korea to happen again in China!" This was the unanimous cry of the people. A wave of donations to comfort the Volunteer Army was set off in various regions. People of all ethnic groups and circles in Chahar and Inner Mongolia presented over 447 million yuan in comfort funds while welcoming the representatives. Yangquan, an industrial and mining area with a population of less than 100,000, donated over 100 million yuan in comfort funds in three days from April 16th to 18th. Mongolian compatriots presented many gifts with national characteristics, and they put the riding boots they presented on the representatives on the spot. The Hui people of Datong presented the representatives with a Longquan sword and three hats of the style worn by Muhammad.
　　People in various places responded to the visit of the Volunteer Army returning representatives with practical actions to resist America and aid Korea. After listening to the reports of the representatives, many workers in Xinxiang City revised their production plans and proposed to challenge the Ma Hengchang team. Farmers in the Second District of Zhangjiakou City proposed to apply 50 more loads of manure per mu than last year, and strive to increase production by two dou of grain per mu. Zhu Denlong, a model agricultural laborer from Shanyin, said: "If we increase production by an inch, the American devils will die by a foot. We must produce more grain and grow more cotton to support the front, so that the front can eat and dress warmly and win more victories." In the business community of Shijiazhuang City, 21 industries collectively paid taxes to welcome the visit of the representatives. When the representatives were in Taiyuan, 49 industries paid off their first quarter taxes for this year in three days. Some cadres in Xinxiang City who had thoughts of retiring drew strength from the reports of the representatives and became active in their work. Some were so moved that they wrote letters of determination in tears, expressing their determination to serve the people to the end. A representative of the people from all walks of life in Hebei Province warmly grasped the hand of a Volunteer Army returning representative and told him: "Comrade, please tell everyone back there: We in the country must suppress the counter-revolutionaries, and we must also tell the people there about your arduous struggles." In the cities of Chahar and Suiyuan, many young men and women asked to join the Volunteer Army, asked to go to Korea with the representatives to fight the American devils; and many young people wanted to donate blood to the wounded soldiers of the Volunteer Army.
　　As a working cadre in Xinxiang City said: "This time, the Volunteer Army returning representatives told their stories in person, and the propaganda combining typical deeds with the masses' thoughts touched the hearts of the masses with every speech, opening up a broad road for deepening the movement to resist America and aid Korea in the future." Now, many regions are conveying the reports of the Volunteer Army returning representatives to the broad masses of the people. The Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in its plan to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea in May and June, proposed to convey the reports of the Volunteer Army returning representatives to every place and every person in the province.

　　志愿军归国代表在华北
    从三月底到五月下旬，中国人民志愿军归国代表高巢、王剑魂、李激涛，先后到了华北区的保定、石家庄、太原、太谷、阳泉、新乡、安阳、宣化、张家口、大同、归绥、包头等城市，向六十一万六千多人民群众作了六十四次报告。代表们不论到那里，欢迎的人群总是十分拥挤。宣化全城人口只有三万，欢迎代表们的却达到两万。在大同，沿街欢迎代表们的有五万人。人们争着向代表们投花、献花、献旗、献礼。在太原时，代表们坐的吉普车被同胞们沿途献送的礼物堆满了。在察哈尔、绥远各地，人们把代表们抬来抬去，亲切地拥抱他们，虔敬地向他们献旗献礼。许多人以能够抬一次代表，和代表们握一次手为无上光荣。代表们从张家口赴大同时，沿途天镇、罗文皂、阳高等地的人民站在雨里等候着迎送他们。在阳高，志愿军代表们劝冒雨欢送的群众早些回去，他们回答：“你们在朝鲜前线爬冰卧雪都能忍受，这一点雨算什么？”在石家庄，工厂里的劳动模范们亲手把他们自己的奖章送给志愿军归国代表。许多地区的农民献出自己珍贵的土产。有的妇女献出贴上纸花的鸡蛋。阳高县一个农民，从一百二十里外赶到大同来专为代表们献葡萄。
    直接听到志愿军代表报告的六十一万六千多人和成百万收听广播的群众，对代表们叙述的志愿军英勇斗争的生动事迹，表示了无限的感激与崇敬，他们为我们的祖国有这样的英雄战士而感到光荣与骄傲。同时，他们对美帝国主义在朝鲜的种种兽性的罪行，感到无限的愤恨。
    “不是志愿军出国，美国强盗早就打上门了”，“坚决抗美援朝，支援朝鲜前线，不让美帝国主义在朝鲜的罪恶行为再在中国发生！”这是人们一致的呼声。各地区都掀起了慰劳志愿军的捐献热潮。察哈尔和内蒙古各民族各界的人民，在欢迎代表时，献出慰问金达四亿四千七百多万元。阳泉是一个不满十万人口的工矿区，在四月十六日到十八日三天中，就捐献了慰问金一亿余元。蒙古同胞献出许多带有民族特色的礼品，他们当场给代表们穿上由他们献出的马靴。大同回胞献给代表们一把龙泉剑和三顶穆罕默德戴过的那种形式的帽子。
    各地人民都以抗美援朝的实际行动来回答志愿军归国代表的访问。新乡市许多工人，听了代表们的报告之后，改订了生产计划，提出向马恒昌小组应战。张家口市二区农民提出要每亩地上比去年多上五十担粪，争取每亩地增产二斗粮。山阴农业劳动模范朱登龙说：“我们生产长一寸，美国鬼子死一尺。我们要多打粮食，多种棉花，支援前线，让前方吃饱穿暖，多打胜仗。”石家庄市的工商界中，有二十一个行业以集体缴税来欢迎代表们的访问。代表们在太原时，有四十九个行业在三天中缴清了今年第一季税款。新乡市某些有退伍思想的干部，从代表们的报告中汲取了力量，工作积极起来了。有的感动得痛哭流涕地写下决心书，表示了为人民服务到底的决心。河北省各界人民代表会议的一位代表，亲切地握住一位志愿军归国代表的手，告诉他：“同志，你回去告诉大家：我们在国内，一定要把反革命分子镇压住，也一定把你们艰苦斗争的情况，告诉我们那里的人。”察哈尔、绥远各城市，都有许多青年男女要求参加志愿军，要求跟着代表们到朝鲜去打美国鬼子；还有许多青年要向志愿军负伤战士献血。
    如同新乡市的一位工作干部所说的：“这次志愿军归国代表现身说法，通过典型事迹结合群众思想的宣传，每一次讲话都打动了群众的心，给今后深入抗美援朝运动开辟了宽广的道路。”现在，许多地区正在把志愿军归国代表的报告向广大人民传达。中共察哈尔省委在五、六月份深入抗美援朝运动的计划里，提出了要把志愿军归国代表的报告传达到全省每一处每一人。
