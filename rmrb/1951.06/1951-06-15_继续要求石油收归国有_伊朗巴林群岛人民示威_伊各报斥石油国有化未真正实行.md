　　Xinhua News Agency, June 14th, Tehran dispatch: According to the "Kahan" newspaper's Bahrain Islands dispatch, the masses in Bahrain Islands continue to demonstrate, advocating the nationalization of the Bahrain Islands' oil industry and the expulsion of the Bahrain Islands' Sheikhs and British advisors.

　　During the June 10th demonstration, several people were injured. There were also deaths and injuries during clashes with the police a week earlier.

　　According to sources, British authorities hope to grant the Sheikhs of Bahrain Islands and Kuwait so-called "complete independence" in the Persian Gulf region, forcing Arab countries to formally recognize this "independence," thereby creating a "fait accompli" and hindering the return of Bahrain Islands to Iran.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 11th, Tehran dispatch: The "Dad" newspaper, commenting on the Iranian situation, said: The actual measures for taking over the files and enterprises of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have not yet been carried out. This company, which has overstepped its bounds, still retains its previous position, as if nothing has changed. For example, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company continues to issue daily administrative and business orders, it has its own security forces, enjoys the right to conduct foreign trade without paying customs duties, and publishes its own propaganda newspapers.

　　The "Dad" newspaper astonishingly raised the following questions: Although Iran announced the nationalization of the oil industry as early as the end of April, why is the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company still operating in Khuzestan like an "independent government"? Why, after the announcement of the nationalization of the oil industry, has the only change in the status of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company been that Iranian authorities add the words "formerly" before the company's name in commercial correspondence to the company and in Iranian newspapers mentioning the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company? The newspaper said: No truly effective practical measures have been taken to implement the nationalization bill and expel the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company from Iran.

　　继续要求石油收归国有        　 伊朗巴林群岛人民示威     
    伊各报斥石油国有化未真正实行
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰消息引“喀汉报”巴林群岛讯，巴林群岛的群众继续进行示威游行，主张把巴林群岛的石油工业收归国有并把巴林群岛的酋长与英国顾问一起赶走。
    六月十日示威时，有多人受伤。在一周以前与警察发生冲突时也有死伤。
    据所得消息称，英国当局希望以波斯湾地区的所谓“完全独立”给与巴林群岛与科威特的酋长们，迫使阿拉伯各国正式承认这种“独立”，从而造成“既成事实”，阻碍巴林群岛归还伊朗。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰讯：《达德报》在评论伊朗局势时说：接收英伊石油公司挡案和企业的实际措施，至今都没有进行。这个喧宾夺主的公司，仍保留着它以前的地位，好像一切都没有改变。例如，英伊石油公司继续发布日常行政和业务命令，它有自己的警卫部队，享有不纳关税进行对外贸易的权利，并发行它自己的宣传报纸。
    “达德报”惊异地提出下列问题：虽然早在四月底伊朗就宣布石油工业国有化，但是为什么前英伊石油公司仍在库齐斯坦像“独立政府”一样地进行活动？为什么在宣布石油工业国有化以后，英伊石油公司地位所受到的唯一改变，只是伊朗当局在致该公司的商业函件中，及伊朗各报提及英伊石油公司时，在该公司名字前面加上“以前”二字？该报说：关于实施国有化法案和把英伊石油公司逐出伊朗的真正有效的实际措施，目前一点也没有进行。
