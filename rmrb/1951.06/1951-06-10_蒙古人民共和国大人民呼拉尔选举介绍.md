　　Introduction to the Elections for the Great People's Khural of the Mongolian People's Republic
    The elections for the Great People's Khural (i.e., the Supreme People's Assembly) of the Mongolian People's Republic, to be held on June 10th, are an event of major political importance for the Mongolian People's Republic. On this day, the Mongolian people will, for the first time, elect the highest state power organ of the Mongolian People's Republic – the Great People's Khural – based on the amendments and supplements to the Constitution passed by the Ninth Great People's Khural in February 1949. According to the new regulations, direct elections replace multi-stage elections, and secret elections replace open elections, making the electoral system more democratic.
    The electoral system of the Mongolian People's Republic is a truly universal suffrage system. According to the Constitution, all citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of gender, race or nationality, religion, education level, whether nomadic or settled, or property status and social origin, have the right to vote and be elected. The only exceptions are those deprived of the right to vote by court decision and those deemed mentally ill according to legal procedures. Women enjoy equal voting and eligibility rights as men. The election adopts an equal system, with each voter having one vote. Military personnel enjoy the same voting rights as all citizens.
    The Great People's Khural is the highest state power organ of the Mongolian People's Republic. It passes the Constitution, amends the Constitution, stipulates the basic principles and measures of domestic and foreign policy, and elects the Small Khural. Regular sessions of the Great People's Khural are convened by the Small Khural every three years. The Small Khural is the highest state power organ during the recess of the Great People's Khural. The Presidium of the Small Khural, elected by the Small Khural, is the highest state power organ during the recess of the Small Khural. One of the functions of the Small Khural is to organize the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers is the highest executive organ of the state power of the Mongolian People's Republic. It is responsible to the Great People's Khural and the Small Khural, and during their recess, it is responsible to the Presidium of the Small Khural. The members of the Council of Ministers are: the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Ministers of various ministries, and the Director of the Planning, Statistics, and Supervision Bureau. The current Chairman of the Presidium of the Small Khural is Bumtsend, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (or Premier) is Marshal Choibalsan.
    Since the Presidium of the Small Khural issued the decree on April 9 this year regarding the holding of elections for the Great People's Khural on June 10, the Mongolian people have enthusiastically launched the election campaign since April 10. The outstanding leader of the Mongolian people, Marshal Choibalsan, was nominated as the first candidate. Tsendenbal, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Bumtsend, and other leaders of the Party and government have also been unanimously nominated as candidates by the Mongolian people. Other nominated candidates are the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Mongolian people, including advanced livestock breeders, shock workers, and workers in science, art, and culture.

　　蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔选举介绍
    六月十日举行的蒙古人民共和国大人民呼拉尔（即最高人民会议）的选举，是蒙古人民共和国的具有重大政治重要性的事件。这一天，蒙古人民将第一次根据一九四九年二月第九届大人民呼拉尔通过的对于宪法的修正和补充，选出蒙古人民共和国的最高国家政权机关——大人民呼拉尔。根据新的规定，直接选举制代替了多级选举制，秘密选举制代替了公开选举制，选举制度更加民主化了。
    蒙古人民共和国的选举制度是真正的普遍选举制。根据宪法，凡年满十八岁的公民，不分性别，不分种族和民族，不分信仰，不分教育程度，不管游牧或定居，不问财产状况与社会出身，都有选举权和被选举权。唯有由法庭判决褫夺选举权者和按法定手续被认为患精神病者例外。妇女享有与男子同等的选举权与被选举权。选举采取平等制，每一选民都有一票选举权。军人享有与一切公民同等的选举权。
    大人民呼拉尔是蒙古人民共和国的最高国家政权机关。它通过宪法，修正宪法，规定内外政策的基本原则和措施，并选举小呼拉尔。大人民呼拉尔例会，由小呼拉尔每三年召开一次。小呼拉尔是大人民呼拉尔休会期间的最高国家政权机关。由小呼拉尔选出的小呼拉尔主席团，是小呼拉尔休会期间的最高国家政权机关。小呼拉尔的职权之一是组织部长会议。部长会议是蒙古人民共和国国家政权的最高执行机关。它对大人民呼拉尔和小呼拉尔负责，在它们休会期间就对小呼拉尔主席团负责。部长会议的组成人员是：主席、副主席、各部部长以及计划、统计、监察局局长。现任小呼拉尔主席团主席是布马增，部长会议主席（或称总理）是乔巴山元帅。
    自小呼拉尔主席团在今年四月九日发布关于大人民呼拉尔选举在六月十日举行的法令后，从四月十日开始，蒙古人民就热烈地展开了选举运动。蒙古人民的卓越的领袖乔巴山元帅被提名为第一名候选人。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会总书记泽登巴尔、布马增和党与政府的其他领袖，也都被蒙古人民一致提名为候选人。其他被提名的候选人都是蒙古人民的最优秀的儿女，他们包括先进的牲畜饲养者，突击工人，科学、艺术和文化工作者。        （新华社）
