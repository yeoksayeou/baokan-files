　  Shanghai Workers Launch Patriotic Production Increase Campaign
    Many Workers Decide to Make Long-Term Donations Through Voluntary Labor or Overtime Bonuses
    Shanghai factories are enthusiastically launching a patriotic production increase and donation campaign. Many factory workers have formulated long-term production increase and donation plans. Workers at factories such as the No. 1 and No. 2 factories of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company have all formulated plans for monthly voluntary labor for one day or long-term donations using overtime production bonuses. By the 6th, 75% of the groups in the No. 2 factory had proposed one day of voluntary labor each month and were striving to increase production. In the steelmaking workshop, the Wang Baoshan group shortened the feeding and furnace preparation time; the Ban Zongcun group produced a heat of alloy steel in 3 minutes and 58 seconds. Workers and staff of the No. 3 factory of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company of the East China Industrial Department decided to donate what they could on the basis of increased production. Since the 4th of this month, workers and staff of the factory have set new records three times in the production of six-point bamboo joint steel. The No. 2 factory of the company exceeds the prescribed task by an average of more than 66% every day, and all employees of the factory donate 20% to 50% of their overtime bonuses. The Asia Steel Factory, Shanghai Tool Factory, and Qiujiang Machine Factory have also formulated long-term production increase and donation plans. After seeing the call of the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, Ping Aqiu of the machine forging workshop of the Asia Steel Factory created a new record of producing 18 motor magnetic poles on the 4th; on the 5th, it was increased to 20 pieces. On the 6th, Ping Aqiu and Xu Yuanzhen created a new record of 22 pieces. The Wu Hanwen group of the electrician's room of the China Shipbuilding Factory guaranteed to work one extra day each month in the future and donate all overtime wages until Korea is completely liberated. Employees of the grinding ingot rod section of the private Chengfu Iron Factory have formulated a patriotic production increase plan for June; among them, the Chen Ronggen group produced 4,000 ingot feet in May and decided to increase it to 4,500 in June, and suggested to the capitalists that the profits from the increased production be donated.
