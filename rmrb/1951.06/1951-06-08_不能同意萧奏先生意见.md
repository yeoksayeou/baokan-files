　　Disagreeing with Mr. Xiao Zou's Opinion
            (1) Editor:
    Mr. Xiao Zou's article on June 6th, discussing that the film "The Life of Wu Xun" still has certain value, contains several arguments and analogies that I cannot agree with.
    Mr. Xiao Zou's reasoning, based on "existence determines consciousness," explains that the "historical conditions" of the Wu Xun era determined Wu Xun's "path." This is a viewpoint of mechanical materialism, not historical materialism.
    Mr. Xiao Zou said that "the spirit of Wu Xun could not have the slightest influence in the Mao Zedong era," which is an arbitrary statement. We know that "old things are never reconciled to withdrawing from the stage of history." Social ideology is the superstructure of the social economic base. New ideologies arising from the new base must resolutely fight against old ideologies to completely defeat them.
    Secondly, Mr. Xiao Zou compares Tao Xingzhi and Zhang Boling to Wu Xun. Regarding Mr. Tao, his lifelong spirit of resisting the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the erroneous viewpoints in his educational thought should be strictly separated. The former is admirable, while the latter should be criticized. Regarding Zhang Boling, as Mr. Xiao Zou said, he "ran a Western bourgeois education," which played a certain progressive role at the time. If it weren't for this, then Zhang Boling's educational career would not be worth mentioning. Yuan Yueyun
            (2) Editor:
    Mr. Xiao Zou affirms that the film "The Life of Wu Xun" has a certain value, saying that Wu Xun's mistakes were due to the limitations of his objective conditions, which prevented him from being literate and understanding Marxism-Leninism, thus inevitably committing the error of "class reconciliation." This is incorrect. Because the peasants and handicraftsmen who participated in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Rebellion at that time also did not understand Marxism-Leninism and were also illiterate. Their illiteracy was a shortcoming, but they were revolutionary.
    Mr. Xiao Zou also said that although Wu Xun was not as good as Hong Xiuquan, "he was still better than Zeng Guofan." May I ask if this is the reason why Wu Xun should be made into portraits and films to be praised?

### 不能同意萧奏先生意见

　　不能同意萧奏先生意见
            （一）编辑同志：
    六月六日萧奏先生一文，谈到电影《武训传》还是有一定的价值，其中若干论点和比拟都是我所不能同意的。
    萧先生根据“存在决定意识”的理由说明武训时代的“历史条件”决定了武训的“道路”。这是机械唯物论而不是历史唯物论的观点。
    萧先生说“武训精神在毛泽东时代就不可能发生丝毫影响”，这是武断的说法。我们知道，“旧的事物决不甘心退出历史舞台”。社会思想意识是社会经济基础的上层建筑，产生于新基础之上的新思想意识必须坚决向旧思想意识作斗争才能彻底战胜它。
    其次萧先生把陶行知和张伯苓比武训。关于陶先生，他毕生反抗蒋匪帮的斗争精神和他教育思想中的错误观点应严格分开。前者值得钦佩，后者应受批判。关于张伯苓，也正如萧先生所说：“办的是西洋资产阶级的教育”，在当时曾起到一定的进步作用。如果不是这样，那张伯苓的教育事业就不足道了。 袁岳云
            （二）编辑同志：
    萧奏先生肯定电影《武训传》有一定的价值，说武训的错误，是由于他的客观条件所限，使他不认识字，更不懂马克思列宁主义，因而必然犯“阶级调和”的错误。这是不对的。因为当时参加太平天国和捻军的农民、手工业者，同样是不懂得马克思列宁主义的，同样是不认识字的。他们不识字虽是缺点，但他们却是革命的。
    萧奏先生还说武训虽不如洪秀全，“但总比曾国藩要强些”。请问这是否就是应该制成画传和电影来赞扬武训的理由呢？
