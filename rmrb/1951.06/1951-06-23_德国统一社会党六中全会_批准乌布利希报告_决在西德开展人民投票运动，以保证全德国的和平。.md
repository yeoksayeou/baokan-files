Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 21st: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its sixth plenary session in Berlin from June 13th to 15th, presided over by Pieck. A communique issued after the meeting announced that the central focus of the plenary session was the lengthy report by General Secretary Ulbricht: "The Current Political Situation and the Lessons of the People's Vote."

In his report, Ulbricht argued that the results of the people's vote held in the German Democratic Republic and the democratic sector of Berlin were a great victory for the forces of peace. The current task is to redouble efforts to hold a people's vote in West Germany and West Berlin to guarantee peace for all of Germany.

Ulbricht also provided a detailed analysis of the revival of German imperialism (which has become a major ally of American monopoly capital in Europe, and therefore American imperialism has assigned it a special status). This situation is manifested in the following facts: the power of arms dealers and bankers has been restored; West Germany is being remilitarized; the West German economy has shifted to military production, causing the peace economy to shrink increasingly; a policy of revenge is being implemented; war propaganda is being intensified; and terror is being used against workers and all those who support peace.

Ulbricht exposed the reactionary role of the leadership of various bourgeois parties in West Germany, the right-wing Social Democratic leaders, and the executive committee of the West German Trade Union Federation, which clearly represents the interests of German imperialism. Since fascist militarist alliances such as the "First Legion" and the SS "Grossdeutschland Regiment" have emerged openly, it has become a decisive task to establish the unity of action of the working class in West Germany and West Berlin, to closely unite all peace-loving and patriotic forces of the German people, and to use all forces to hold a people's vote in West Germany and West Berlin.

Ulbricht then talked about the preparations for the Third World Youth and Student Festival. He emphasized that it is necessary to systematically strengthen explanatory work and to educate the masses of the people in the spirit of friendship with the people of other countries.

The plenary session approved Ulbricht's report.

　　德国统一社会党六中全会
    批准乌布利希报告
    决在西德开展人民投票运动，以保证全德国的和平。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会于六月十三日至十五日，在皮克主持下，在柏林举行第六次全会。会后发表的公报宣布：全会注意的中心是总书记乌布利希的长篇报告：“目前的政治形势与人民投票的教训。”
    乌布利希在报告中认为，在德意志民主共和国与柏林民主区举行的人民投票的结果，是和平力量的巨大胜利。现在的任务是，加倍努力，在西德与西柏林举行人民投票，以保证全德国的和平。
    乌布利希同时详细分析了德国帝国主义（它成为美国垄断资本在欧洲主要的同盟者，因此，美国帝国主义给它分派了一个特别的地位）复活的问题。这种情形表现在下列的事实上：军火商与银行家的权力恢复了；西德在重新军国主义化；西德经济已转向军事生产，并使和平经济日益萎缩；实行报复政策；加紧战争宣传以及用恐怖手段对付工人与一切拥护和平的人们。
    乌布利希揭露了西德各资产阶级政党的领导机构、右翼社会民主党领袖以及显然代表德国帝国主义利益的西德工会联合会执行委员会等的反动作用。如“第一军团”与党卫师“大德意志团”之类的法西斯军国主义联盟已经以公开的面貌出现，因此，确立西德与西柏林的工人阶级行动的统一，德国全体爱好和平与爱国的人民力量紧密地团结起来，利用各种力量在西德与西柏林举行人民投票，这些便成了决定性的任务。
    乌布利希接着谈到第三届世界青年与学生联欢节的筹备工作。他强调说，必须有系统地加强解释工作，用与其他各国人民友好的精神来教育人民群众。
    全会批准了乌布利希的报告。
