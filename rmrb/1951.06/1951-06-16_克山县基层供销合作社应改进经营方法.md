　　Kershan County Grassroots Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
　　Should Improve Business Methods
To the Editor:
    In Kershan County, Heilongjiang Province, there are eighty-five village supply and marketing cooperatives, of which only twenty-six can maintain their expenses; the remaining dozens of village cooperatives are run listlessly. This is mainly because their view of the cooperative serving its members is still unclear, and their business operations are not combined with the needs of the masses. Secondly, the phenomenon of buying on credit has not been eliminated, causing funds to be unable to circulate and business to be unable to develop. The Heping Village Cooperative in the Eighth District of the county has a total of 220 million yuan in funds (Northeast currency), but because they stick to the counter and only sell cigarettes and liquor, they have accumulated 16 million yuan in slow-moving goods, the village government owes 22.7 million yuan, and the members owe 23.22 million yuan. There are more than twenty such cooperatives in the county (accounting for 25 percent). Among them, the Renhe Village Cooperative lost 12 million yuan in the first quarter alone. Farmers in Victory Village, Henan District, have fifteen fat pigs and are eager to sell them in order to cultivate the land, but the cooperative doesn't even ask. The members are very dissatisfied with this. Some want to withdraw their shares, and some say, "Consider our investment finished, just hope you don't ask us for money again."

　　克山县基层供销合作社
　　应改进经营方法编辑同志：
    黑龙江省克山县共有八十五个村供销合作社，其中能维持开支的只有二十六个社；其余的几十个村合作社都办得没精打采。这主要是由于他们对合作社为社员服务的观点仍不明确，业务经营与群众需要不结合；其次就是赊欠现象仍没有消除，以致使资金不能流转，业务无法开展。该县八区和平村合作社共有资金二亿二千万元（东北币，下同），由于他们死守柜台，光办烟卷、烧酒，致积压冷货达一千六百多万元，村政府赊欠二千二百七十多万元，社员欠二千三百二十二万元。这样的合作社全县就有二十多个（占百分之二十五）。其中仁合村合作社在第一季度就赔了一千二百多万元。河南区胜利村的农民，有十五口肥猪，为了种地都急着想卖，但合作社连问都不问。社员们对此非常不满，有的要抽股，有的说：“入股就算完啦，只希望别再向咱要钱就行。”
