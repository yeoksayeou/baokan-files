　　Chairman Mao Leads Our Miao People Towards Brightness
　　Wu Diping, Mengzang School
    I am a Miao youth studying at the Mengzang School. To be born in the great era of Mao Zedong is a blessing, especially when I recall the dark and miserable life of the past, I feel how precious this happiness is!
    During the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, our ethnic group suffered extremely cruel oppression and exploitation. At that time, no matter what the occasion, we dared not say that we were Miao people, because as soon as we said it, we would be insulted and discriminated against.
    When I was in middle school, a pseudo-commissioner came to inspect the school. At a meeting, he suddenly asked, "Are there any border compatriots here?" (Because Chiang Kai-shek said that China only has one Han ethnicity, and the others are branches of the Han, so they used the term "border compatriots" to refer to all ethnic minorities). Seeing that no one spoke or raised their hands, he added, "’Border compatriots’ are what we often call ‘Miaos’.” I felt it was very harsh and sad to hear the word “Miaozi”, which was a derogatory and discriminatory term for the Miao people. One day, someone insulted me again, and I fought with him in the classroom, smashing the desks and chairs. Unfortunately, the "Director of Guidance" saw it. He asked me why I was fighting. I said he called me "Miaozi" and insulted me. He said, "I don't care about these things, if the desks and chairs are broken, you have to pay for them." I refused to pay, so he locked me up. We were also not allowed to speak our own ethnic language or wear our own ethnic clothes. I simply couldn't continue to live here, so I had to ask for leave to go home and never wanted to return to school again.
    Due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism in the past, a strong sense of narrow nationalism was formed in us, and we even believed that "Han people are not good people," and there was a "revenge" mentality. Therefore, as soon as children grew up a little, the elders would teach them, "Stones cannot be used as pillows, Han people cannot be used as friends," training them not to trust Han people.
    After liberation, we turned over, and the brilliance of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies shone on our ethnic minorities, and on all of China.
    The Common Program stipulates: All ethnic groups in China are equal, and no discrimination or oppression is allowed; all ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their languages and scripts, and to maintain or reform their customs and habits; regional autonomous governments can be established... This is completely suitable for our needs.
    Today, we have gained equality and freedom, and everything about us is respected. Everywhere we hear friendly voices calling us "fraternal ethnic groups." We never heard such voices in the past!
    At school, when we are with our classmates, everyone's feelings are very harmonious, like brothers and sisters, without any estrangement. We can study revolutionary theory and study our own ethnic languages and other new knowledge that is suitable for our needs. All our living expenses and school supplies are provided by the government.
    Now, the first Miao Autonomous Region has been established in Lushan Kaili, Guizhou, and the people of ethnic minorities have taken control of the political power. When I received this news, I smiled from the bottom of my heart. I shed tears, these were tears of happiness!
    Chairman Mao and the Communist Party liberated us and educated us, allowing us to recognize the road to liberation for our ethnic group. We have realized that the ethnic issue is only a part of the overall issue of the revolution. Only when the revolution is victorious can the ethnic issue be resolved. The Han rulers of the past were our enemies, but they were also the enemies of the Han people; it is not that "Han people are not good people," let alone that "Han people cannot be made friends." Our narrow nationalist thinking was slowly eliminated. The facts corrected the erroneous understanding of the past that "stones cannot be used as pillows, and Han people cannot be made friends," and we all sing the praises of ethnic equality and unity. Now you will often hear this loud song in our area: "The Miao family has the sun in the sky, Miao and Han brothers walk in rows, Miao and Han brothers sit in rows, Miao and Han brothers are happy."
    Who threw us into the abyss of disaster? Who saved us? Today, every one of our compatriots is very clear, listen: "The reactionaries drove the Miao family out of the house, Chiang Kai-shek threw the Miao family into the fire pit. Chairman Mao saved the Miao family, and the Communist Party brought the Miao family into the house. Chairman Mao is like the sun, the Communist Party is like the stars in the sky, leading the Miao family towards brightness, forever towards brightness."
    We love our leader Chairman Mao, and we also love our great motherland, because Chairman Mao is our great savior, and the motherland is our "national big family." For Chairman Mao, for our great motherland, for our happy life, we are determined to dedicate all our strength.

### 毛主席领导我们苗族人民走向光明

　　毛主席领导我们苗族人民走向光明
    蒙藏学校　吴涤平
    我是一个苗族青年，现在蒙藏学校学习。生在伟大的毛泽东时代是幸福的，尤其当我回想到过去那种黑暗惨淡的生活的时候，更觉得这幸福是多么的宝贵啊！
    在国民党匪帮统治时代，我们民族受着极端残酷的压迫与剥削。那时候，不管是在什么场合，我们不敢说出自己是苗家，因为一说出来就要遭受到侮辱和歧视。
    我在中学读书的时候，有一次伪专员到学校视察，在一个大会上，突然发问：“这里有没有边胞学生？”（因为蒋介石说中国只有一个汉族，其他的都是汉族的宗支，所以他们把所有的少数民族都用“边胞”这两个字来称呼）。他看没有人说话，也没有人举手，再补充一句：“‘边胞’就是我们常说的‘苗子’。”原来“苗子”这两个字是对苗族轻蔑、歧视的称谓，我听到了感觉很刺耳，很难过。有一天，一个人又侮辱我，我和他在教室内打起来，把桌椅都打烂了。不巧，被“训育主任”看见，他问我为什么打架，我说他骂我“苗子”，侮辱我。他说：“我不管这些事，桌椅打烂了，就要赔偿。”我不赔，他就把我禁闭起来了。并不准我们说自己民族的语言，穿自己民族的服装。我简直不能再在这儿继续生活下去，只有借故请假回家，再不愿回到学校了。
    由于过去国民党大汉族主义的长期统治，形成了我们浓厚的狭隘民族主义的思想，甚至认为“汉人都不是好人”，存在着“报复”的心理。所以，小孩子稍一长大，老人就教训他们说：“石头作不得枕头，汉人作不得朋友。”训练他们不相信汉人。
    解放了，我们翻了身，毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀着我们少数民族，照耀着全中国。
    共同纲领规定：中国各民族一律平等，不准许有歧视、压迫的行为存在；各民族有发展其语言文字，保持或改革其风俗习惯的自由；可以成立区域自治政府……。这完全适于我们的要求。
    今天，我们得到了平等、有了自由，我们的一切都受到尊重。在任何地方都听到亲切的声音，称我们为“兄弟民族”，过去是不曾听到这样的声音的！
    在学校里与同学们处在一起，大家的感情非常融洽，好像兄弟姊妹一样，没有任何隔膜。我们可以学习革命理论，研究自己民族的语文及其他适合于我们需要的新知识。我们一切生活费用及学习用品都由政府供给。
    现在，贵州炉山凯里成立了第一个苗族人民自治区，少数民族人民掌握了政权。当我得到这项消息的时候，我由心底深处发出了微笑，我落泪了，这是幸福的热泪！
    毛主席、共产党解放了我们，也教育了我们，让我们认识了我们民族走向解放的道路。我们已认识到：民族问题，只是整个革命的总问题中的一部分。只有革命取得胜利，民族问题才会得到解决。过去汉族的统治者是我们的敌人，但也是汉族人民的敌人；并不是“汉人都不是好人”，更不是“汉人做不得朋友”。我们狭隘民族主义的思想于是慢慢消灭了。事实纠正了过去那种“石头做不得枕头，汉人做不得朋友”的错误认识，我们都歌颂着民族的平等与团结了。现在你在我们区域里将常听到这种响亮的歌声：“苗家天上出太阳，苗汉兄弟走成行，苗汉兄弟排排坐，苗汉兄弟喜洋洋”。
    谁把我们丢进灾难的深渊？谁又拯救了我们？在今天我们每一个同胞都很清楚，你听：“反动派把苗家撵出门去，蒋介石把苗家丢进火坑。毛主席救了苗家，共产党把苗家引进门来。毛主席像太阳，共产党像天星，领导苗家走向光明，永远向光明。”
    我们热爱我们的领袖毛主席，也热爱我们伟大的祖国，因为毛主席是我们的大救星，祖国是我们的“民族大家庭”。为了毛主席，为了我们伟大的祖国，为了我们幸福的生活，我们决献出所有的力量。
