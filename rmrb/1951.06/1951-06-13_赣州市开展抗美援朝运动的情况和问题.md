　　The Situation and Problems of Carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement in Ganzhou City
　　Shi Youping, Head of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Ganzhou Municipal Committee

    Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province, has a population of 110,000. By late April of this year, the number of people participating in signing in support of the conclusion of a peace pact reached 100,496, accounting for 95.5 percent of the city's population. The number of people participating in voting against the United States arming Japan reached 99,085, accounting for 90.1 percent of the city's population. The number of people participating in establishing patriotic covenants also reached 99,000, accounting for 90 percent of the city's total population. The signatures were organized by the study committees, administrative heads, propagandists of each unit, propaganda workers "contracted" by each district, or heads of residents' groups. From workers to nuns, from the elderly to children, people from all walks of life in the city enthusiastically signed their names. Voting was mostly done by a show of hands after accusation meetings were held. Patriotic covenants were also mostly conceived and discussed by the masses themselves, starting from their actual situations.

    On May Day, 62,000 people in the city participated in demonstrations, and another 10,000 people participated in security work during the parades. People made the signed lists, the voting numbers, and the group, family, or individual patriotic covenant implementation codes into many propaganda boards, which were held high in the parade, intermingling with 10,000 national flags.

    The reason why the people of the city enthusiastically participated in the patriotic movement is inseparable from the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda and education work since June last year. In particular, in April this year, the CCP Ganzhou Municipal Committee, with 200 party propagandists as the backbone, organized nearly 20,000 propaganda teams in the city to carry out universal propaganda. This included 36 propaganda trucks, more than 3,200 people from Guangdong flower stick and waist drum teams, more than 3,100 staff from movie theaters, theaters, amateur theater groups, literary associations, and civil education centers, 6,400 teachers and students from schools and training courses, and more than 6,900 people from institutions and organizations (including the Federation of Industry and Commerce's propaganda team). In order to ensure the elimination of blank spots, 7,000 people were responsible for district propaganda in a "contracted" manner, so that patriotic education was popularized to every household and every person.

    The main method of propaganda and education was to hold accusation meetings. From the end of February to before May Day, all organs, organizations, schools, factories, and residents' groups in the city held accusation meetings, with the participation of more than 53,800 people, nearly half of the city's population. The people of Ganzhou City suffered deeply from the trampling of Japanese invaders, American imperialism, and the Jiang bandit gang. Before and after the Japanese invaders occupied Ganzhou, they carried out large-scale bestial bombings, burnings, and killings. Part of the U.S. Air Force was stationed in Ganzhou for more than half a year before 1944. They arbitrarily shot and killed Chinese people on the streets in broad daylight and raped Chinese women wantonly. Employee Chen Xiangguo and merchant girl Pan were killed by Americans in this way. Jiang Jingguo, a faithful running dog of American imperialism, also occupied Ganzhou for many years and massacred a large number of people in the former land revolution area. This faithful running dog of American imperialism even forbade the Chinese people to say a word after American soldiers arbitrarily killed and insulted the Chinese people in Ganzhou. The people of Ganzhou recalled these bloody feuds, and were almost in tears and extremely angry at all accusation meetings. They expressed that they must take action to avenge their hatred, resolutely resist America and aid Korea, and resolutely oppose the United States arming Japan. Workers created many new records in the patriotic labor emulation. Students in various schools, while actively reforming their thinking and stepping up their studies, also played a pioneering role in patriotic propaganda. At the same time, they enthusiastically launched physical exercise activities. 10,000 people in the city signed up to participate in the Red May Sports Meeting. All sectors of industry and commerce launched a collective tax prepayment competition. By April 30, 98.5 percent of the taxes due from May 1 had been paid.

    However, this movement also has shortcomings. Although the movement was popularized, it was not deep enough. Before April, the majority of illiterate people in the city did not understand what it meant to resist America and aid Korea. After May Day, although they knew they had to "fight America and help Korea," they did not have a deep understanding of the nature of American imperialism. Among workers, intellectuals, and cadres, some still retained a certain degree of pro-American and fear-of-American thoughts. Some cadres do not have a deep understanding that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is the driving force for promoting all work. In addition, there are still blank spots in individual areas. Secondly, the organization of the propaganda team is very temporary; the reporters have not regularly performed their duties; the number of propagandists is too small; among the contracted propagandists, some do not know how to do propaganda work, and at the same time do not understand the ideological situation of the masses, and cannot carry out propaganda according to the thinking of the masses.

    In order to make the movement lasting, the above shortcomings must be overcome. In particular, it is necessary to seize the inspection and revision of patriotic covenants, which will be the central issue in the anti-American and aid-Korea movement in the future.

　　赣州市开展抗美援朝运动的情况和问题
    中共赣州市委宣传部长  时佑平
    江西省赣州市有人口十一万，在今年四月下旬参加拥护缔结和平公约签名的人数达到十万零四千九百九十六人，即占全市人口百分之九十五点五；参加反对美国武装日本投票的人数达到九万九千零八十五人，即占全市人口的百分之九十点一；参加订立爱国公约的人数，也达到九万九千人，即占全市人口总数的百分之九十。签名是由各单位的学习委员会、行政负责人、宣传员、各地区“包干”的宣传工作者或居民小组长等负责组织的。从工人到尼姑，从老年人到儿童，全市各界人民都踊跃地签了名。投票则大多是在举行了控诉会之后，以举手的方式进行的。爱国公约也多半是由群众自己动了脑筋，经过酝酿讨论，从自己的实际情况出发订立的。
    “五一”那天，全市有六万二千人参加了示威游行，还有一万人参加了游行时的警戒保安工作。人们把签名的名单，投票的数字和团体的、家庭的爱国公约或个人的爱国公约执行守则，制成许多宣传牌，高举在游行队伍里，和一万面国旗交相辉映。
    全市人民所以热烈地参加爱国运动，是与去年六月以来的抗美援朝宣传教育工作分不开的。特别是今年四月，中共赣州市委会以二百名党的宣传员为骨干，在全市组织了近两万人的宣传队伍进行了普遍宣传。其中包括宣传卡车三十六辆，广东花棍和腰鼓队等人员三千二百多人，电影、戏院、业余剧团、文联、民教馆等工作人员三千一百多人，各学校、训练班师生六千四百人，机关、团体（包括工商联的宣传队）人员六千九百多人。为了保证消灭空白点，全市有七千人以“包干”方式负责分区宣传，使爱国教育普及到了每一户每一人。
    进行宣传教育的主要方法是举行控诉会。从二月底到“五一”前，全市各机关、团体、学校、工厂和居民小组都召开了控诉会，参加的人数有五万三千八百多人，将近全市人口的半数。赣州市人民遭受日寇、美帝国主义和蒋匪帮的蹂躏是深重的。日寇侵占赣州前后，曾大举进行兽性的轰炸烧杀。美国的一部分空军在一九四四年前曾在赣州驻了半年多，他们大白天在马路上任意开枪打死中国人民，肆无忌惮地奸污中国妇女。职工陈香果和商民潘姑娘就是这样死在美国人手里的。蒋匪经国也曾盘踞赣州多年，大量地屠杀以前土地革命区的人民，这个美帝国主义的忠实走狗，甚至在美国兵在赣州任意残杀、侮辱中国人民之后，他还不准中国人民说半个不字。赣州人民回忆起了这些血海深仇，差不多在所有的控诉会上都是泣不成声，愤怒万分。他们纷纷表示，一定要行动起来，报仇雪恨，坚决抗美援朝，坚决反对美国武装日本。工人们在爱国劳动竞赛中，创造了许多新纪录。各学校的学生，一面积极改造思想，加紧学习，一面又在爱国宣传中起了先锋作用。同时，他们热烈展开了锻炼身体的运动。全市报名参加红五月运动大会的有一万人。工商界各行业掀起了集体提前纳税竞赛，到四月三十日，已缴齐了五月一日到期的税款的百分之九十八点五。
    但是，这次运动还有缺点。运动虽然普及了，但是不够深入。四月前全市文盲大多数还不懂什么叫做抗美援朝；“五一”后虽然知道了要“打美国，帮朝鲜”，但对美帝国主义的本质还认识得很不深刻。在工人、知识分子和干部中，还有一些人残存着一定程度的崇美、恐美的思想。某些干部对抗美援朝运动是推动一切工作的动力的体会还不深刻。此外，个别地区还有空白点。其次，宣传队伍的组织带有很大的临时性；报告员还没有经常地履行职责；宣传员的人数太少；在包干宣传员中，有一部分不会做宣传工作，同时不了解群众的思想情况，不能针对群众的思想进行宣传。
    为了使运动持久下去，必须克服上述缺点。特别是要抓紧检查和修订爱国公约，这将是今后抗美援朝运动中的中心问题。
