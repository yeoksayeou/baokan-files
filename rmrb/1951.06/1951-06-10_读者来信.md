　　Private Qixin Cement Factory Launches Labor Competition
　　Workers Strive to Improve Product Quality and Quantity
To the Editors:
　　Since the People's Daily and Worker's Daily published readers' criticisms in April and May about the "Tangshan Private Qixin Cement Factory's union leadership not being deeply involved in production," the factory's union cadres have humbly accepted the criticisms, deeply led production, and launched a patriotic competition. I think this spirit of the factory's union cadres is very good.
　　After accepting the newspaper's criticism, the union cadres have begun to deeply involve themselves in on-site production leadership. Currently, each production unit in the factory has formulated patriotic covenants and labor competition plans. Some units have improved labor organization: for example, the workers working on the large kiln for burning clinker in the factory were previously under uncoordinated leadership. The fire-watchers were directly under the Third Brand administration, and the machine operators who poured oil and pushed ash were directly under the Second Brand administration. If anything happened, the two groups of workers would each find their respective administrative supervisors, which was very inconvenient. Now, they have been unified.
　　Comrades have increased their labor enthusiasm during the competition, which has improved both the quantity and quality of products. Comrades who push stone chips have increased from pushing 203 carts per day to 294 carts. Earth-pushing comrades have increased from 44 carts per day to 57 carts. Cement production has exceeded the quota by 35 percent. In addition, there have been significant achievements in conservation. In the past, oil-pouring comrades used to pour oil onto the machine shafts by pouring from oil barrels. Now, they use scrap iron to make small spoons and pour oil onto the machine shafts spoon by spoon. This has reduced oil consumption from 20 catties per day to 14 catties.
　　The factory's power plant, due to the close connection between the electricity, machine, and furnace departments, adjusting the air dampers, and discussing matters together, has significantly reduced coal consumption and significantly increased power generation. Since May, coal consumption has been reduced from 1.2 kilograms to 1.013 kilograms, and power generation has increased by more than 20 percent.
　　Workers' inventions and innovations are emerging one after another. Director Yang of the repair shop said, "This is something that has never happened in the 20 years since the factory was built." The steelmaking group planned to complete 12 tons of steel in the Red May plan, requiring 22 furnace openings, but they completed 12 furnaces in just 12 days. Old Master Wan Fuchun of the steelmaking department came to the factory to help with work during his night shift breaks to understand the quality of steelmaking. Old Master Zhang Yinhuai of the steel casting department used quartz powder and cement instead of sand and lead powder, and the products cast were very good. Old Master Xu Chengyi of the metallurgy department created small scissors for cutting screws, which increased work efficiency tenfold. Currently, all the factory comrades are enthusiastically launching a "use your brain movement."
　　In the enthusiastic competition movement, the factory's union and the Resist America, Aid Korea Committee actively carried out propaganda and mobilization work, established propagandists and mobilization stations, and used factory Resist America, Aid Korea Weekly, blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, radio and other propaganda tools to conduct Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic production increase education for workers. Workers have generally established group patriotic covenants. At present, in addition to timely commendation for workers' inventions and innovations, the union should also urge the capitalists to give material rewards to encourage workers' creative enthusiasm.

　　Tianjin Private Renli Woolen Mill
　　Production Management and Union Work Should Be Improved
To the Editors:
　　In the Tianjin Private Renli Woolen Mill, the consciousness of the workers has increased after liberation, and there have been many improvements in production. However, the capitalist's management of production and the union's work still have many shortcomings, hindering further improvement in production.
　　Regarding the capitalist's management:
　　(1) The capitalists do not pay enough attention to the strength of the working class. For example, the factory union organized a production research group to study and improve the factory's unreasonable old system. Some capitalist managers doubted whether this organization would play any role. Regarding the factory's unreasonable wage system, some people said: the department directors cannot solve this problem, I don't think the union cadres can do anything about it either. Regarding some old and unreasonable systems, some capitalist managers also said not to expose them too much, fearing that it would "affect the emotions of some management personnel." Sometimes the capitalists are not sincere to the union. For example, regarding the production in 1950, the capitalists told the union that they lost money, but in reality, they earned more than 3 billion.
　　(2) The wage system is unreasonable, seriously affecting the production enthusiasm of the workers. The gatekeeper's foreman earns thousands of catties of cornmeal per month, and the janitor who sweeps the yard also earns about 500 catties of cornmeal per month; skilled production workers only earn 500 or 600 catties of cornmeal per month. Therefore, some workers say: "We do a lot of work, but our wages are not as much as the janitor's!" In addition, some people who do not have any skills but have personal relationships with certain management personnel earn more wages. Workers are very dissatisfied with these things.
　　(3) The capitalists delay resolving the issue of wage increases for temporary workers. Some workers have been working in the factory for nearly two years and are still temporary workers. They have repeatedly asked the capitalists or the union to be converted to regular workers, but none have been converted. Temporary workers cannot enjoy the welfare benefits of regular workers, such as getting haircuts, lodging, and placing children in the nursery in the factory.
　　(4) The organizational structure is unscientific, resulting in waste of manpower and materials. For example, there are two personnel departments, both responsible for personnel matters, but sometimes when problems occur, no one is responsible. Other materials, such as wool, yarn, and various materials used for production, are stored separately; this not only wastes manpower, but also makes it inconvenient for workers to claim.
　　Regarding the union's work:
　　(1) I feel that the main shortcoming of the union's work is that it has failed to achieve "everyone running the union." There are 13 or 14 standing committee members of the union, but only three or four people are doing the work regularly. The union chairman has a serious bureaucratic work style. He personally solves even small things such as Zhang San and Li Si quarreling, and cannot use his main strength to lead production. Other committee members also rarely go to the workshops.
　　(2) The union cadres cannot effectively promote the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. The union cannot negotiate with the capitalists to resolve and improve major issues that hinder production and affect the interests of the workers, such as the issue of changing temporary workers to regular workers, the issue of unreasonable labor organization and wage system; the union has also failed to firmly educate certain workers who violate labor discipline.
　　(3) The democratic life of the union is very poor. The union does not commend or encourage workers who are active in production and perform union tasks well, nor does it criticize the bad ones. The union groups should hold meetings regularly to improve workers' political awareness and study and improve production, but some units have not held group meetings for half a year.

　　Hygiene Section of the Shandong Office of the East China Industrial Department
　　Medical Workers Voluntarily Donate Blood to the Wounded
To the Editors:
　　Under the influence of Section Chief Chen Zhen'ao, the staff of the Shandong Office of the East China Industrial Department Hospital enthusiastically signed up to donate blood to seriously wounded Comrade Cui Yude for emergency treatment, saving the wounded's life. This matter was praised by all the workers of the factory where the wounded works.
　　Comrade Cui Yude of the assembly department of a certain factory in Shandong suffered a complex fracture of his lower limbs and local necrosis due to an explosion accident on May 18. After consultation, the doctors believed that amputation was necessary. After obtaining the consent of the person concerned and the approval of the leadership, the operation was performed. However, due to the comrade's weak constitution and excessive bleeding at the time of the injury, he fell into a coma immediately after the operation, and the situation was very dangerous. At this time, Section Chief Chen immediately organized the hospital staff to donate blood for emergency treatment, and he was the first to sign up. Under his influence, Su Weimin, Xu Ben'e, Ji Dongming, Niu Xijun, Jia Guangxing, Wang Xihai, Wang Wenzhuo, Zhang Weidi and other comrades volunteered to donate blood to Comrade Cui Yude. The next morning, Qu Xiuheng, Hu Lansheng, Zhang Pengji, Yu Liqiang, Ji Yuqin, and Zhang Jianmin continued to donate their blood. In this way, the critically ill Comrade Cui Yude quickly escaped from danger and preserved his life. The medical staff's high degree of class friendship deeply moved all the workers of a certain factory.

　　Caring for the Health of the Masses is Supported by the People
To the Editors:
　　In early May, an epidemic occurred in the Tielouying and Zhaoji townships in the Fanghu district of Xixian County, spreading rapidly. After learning about it, the county People's Government immediately organized six Chinese and Western medicine practitioners from the urban area, including Zhang Minquan, to go to the rescue. After several days of intensive treatment, a total of 185 people suffering from measles, 33 people suffering from colds, and 5 people suffering from chickenpox were cured. The local people reflected: "The People's Government really cares about us too much; when we have any difficulties, the government is even more anxious than us; they try their best to solve them." An old lady said: "The doctors now are much kinder and more careful when seeing patients!"
　　Now, in order to prevent the spread of summer epidemics, the county People's Government is planning to carry out a mass summer epidemic prevention and health campaign.

　　For the Convenience of Everyone's Medical Treatment
　　Suggestion for Hospitals to Change the Sunday Holiday System
To the Editors:
　　I have two opinions on the work of public hospitals in Beijing. At present, public hospitals in Beijing generally do not work on Sundays. Personnel from factories, schools, and government agencies are usually very busy, and they often only have time to go to the doctor on Sundays, so this creates a contradiction. In order to take care of everyone's time, I suggest that public hospitals can learn from the methods of trade companies, cooperatives, post offices, some banks, and Xinhua bookstores, and work as usual on Sundays and take holidays on other days. Many private hospitals are open as usual on Sundays.
　　Nowadays, general doctors only prescribe medicine and let it go, and rarely tell patients about the source and name of the disease, the name of the medicine, and what to pay attention to, etc. Some doctors are unwilling to answer patients' questions. The doctors' reason is that they are afraid that telling the patient about the condition will affect the patient's mood. Of course, this can be taken care of appropriately according to the specific situation, but in general, I think it should be explained to the patient clearly. Because this can improve the people's knowledge of medicine and health and reduce diseases. Many doctors only care about treating diseases, and do not explain to the patient the cause of the disease and how to treat it. This is really a bad style, and I think it must be improved.

　　Tax Cadre Geng Shu Organized a Mass Farewell When Transferred
　　Creating a Bad Influence, Hope Relevant Authorities Investigate and Deal With It
To the Editors:
　　Geng Shu, deputy director of the Shannan Tax Collection Office in the Shannan District of Feixi County, Northern Anhui, was recently ordered to transfer. Before leaving, he actually indicated to the cadres on the street to organize the masses to "send him off." In the days before leaving, he asked people to treat him to wine and meals and take photos. Some comrades raised objections to him, but he did not listen. On the morning of May 13, when he left Shannan, there were indeed more than 150 people "sending him off," with yangko drums, gunshots, and firecrackers, which was very lively. According to our preliminary statistics, the expenses for "sending off" wine, meals, photos, gunpowder, firecrackers, etc. totaled about 1,000 catties of rice, and also wasted the time of more than 150 people in vain. This matter has aroused dissatisfaction among many people and has created a serious adverse political impact.
　　Hope the relevant authorities investigate and deal with this matter.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Hua, Li Ze, Gong Weiying, Shannan District People's Government, Feixi County, Northern Anhui

    私营启新洋灰厂开展劳动竞赛
    工人努力提高产品质量和数量编辑同志：
    自人民日报和工人日报在四、五月份先后刊登了读者批评“唐山私营启新洋灰厂工会领导生产不深入”的稿件后，该厂工会干部即虚心接受批评，深入领导生产，开展爱国竞赛。我觉得该厂工会干部这种精神是很好的。
    工会干部在接受报纸批评后，已开始深入现场领导生产。现该厂各生产单位大致都订了爱国公约和劳动竞赛计划。有些单位改善了劳动组织：如该厂在烧灰块的大窑上工作的工人，过去领导不统一，看火工人直属三牌行政，机匠浇油、推灰等工人直属二牌行政。遇有什么事情，两部分工人各找各牌行政主管人，工作很不方便。现在已经统一起来了。
    工友们在竞赛中提高了劳动热情，使产品的数量和质量都提高了。推石碴的工友由每日推二百零三车，提高到二百九十四车。推土工友由每日四十四车提高到五十七车。洋灰产量超过定额百分之三十五。另外，在节约方面也有显著成绩。过去浇油工友往机器轴上浇油的时候，都是拿着油桶倒，现在他们用废铁片作了个小勺，一勺一勺地往机轴上浇油，这样就使油的消耗量由每天二十斤减少到十四斤。
    该厂发电厂由于电、机、炉三部职工密切联系，调节风门，有事大家商量，使煤耗显著降低，发电量显著提高。自五月起，煤耗已由一点二公斤减到一点零一三公斤，发电量则提高百分之二十以上。
    职工们的发明创造层出不穷。修械厂杨主任说：“这是建筑二十年来没有过的事。”化钢部小组在红五月计划要完成十二吨钢的任务，需要开二十二次炉，但他们仅十二天中就完成十二炉。化钢部万福春老师傅夜间开炉，在休息时到厂子来帮助工作，了解钢化的好坏。铸钢部张印槐老师傅，用石英粉与洋灰代替了砂子和铅粉，铸出来的产品非常好。冶工部许成义老师傅创造了剪螺丝用的小剪刀，提高工作效率十倍。现全厂工友热烈地展开了“开动脑筋运动”。
    在热烈的竞赛运动中，该厂工会及抗美援朝委员会积极开展宣传鼓动工作，设立了宣传员和鼓动站，通过厂内抗美援朝周报、黑板报、大字报、广播等宣传工具，向职工进行抗美援朝爱国增产教育，职工普遍订立了小组爱国公约。目前，工会对工人的发明创造除作到及时表扬外，还应督促资方给以物质奖励，以鼓舞工人的创造热情。

    天津私营仁立毛织厂
    生产管理和工会工作应改进编辑同志：
    天津私营仁立毛织厂，解放后职工觉悟提高，生产上有不少改进。但目前资方对生产的管理及工会的工作都还有很多缺点，阻碍着生产进一步的提高。
    关于资方的管理方面：
    （一）资方对工人阶级的力量不够重视。如工厂工会为研究改进厂里不合理的旧制度，组织了一个生产研究小组。对这个组织，某些资方管理人员就怀疑是否会起什么作用。如对于厂内不合理的工资制度，某些人就表示：各部主任无法解决这个问题，我看他们工会干部也没办法。对一些旧的不合理的制度，某些资方管理人员也表示不要揭发得太厉害，怕“影响某些管理人员的情绪”。有时资方对工会不诚恳，如关于一九五○年的生产，资方对工会说是赔了钱，但实际是赚了三十多亿。
    （二）工资制度不合理，严重影响了职工的生产情绪。工厂看门的工头月薪千把斤玉米面，扫院的杂工也有每月挣五百来斤玉米面的；有技术的生产工人，一月也才挣五、六百斤玉米面。因此，有些工人说：“咱干活干的多，工资还没有杂工挣的多咧！”另有一些人虽然没有什么技术，但因和某些管理人员有私人关系，工资就拿得多。工人对这些事情都很不满意。
    （三）资方对临时工的升工问题拖延不解决。有一部分工人在本厂工作已有近两年了，至今仍是临时工。他们屡次向资方或工会要求改为正式工人，但一个也没有改。临时工不能享受正式工人的福利待遇，如在厂内理发、住宿、在托儿所放孩子，都没有他们的份儿。
    （四）组织机构不科学，造成人力物力的浪费。如人事处就有两个，都负责人事问题，但有时发生问题，就全不负责。其他如对生产所用的毛、纱及各种材料，都是分头负责保管；不但浪费人力，工人领用起来也很不方便。
    关于工会工作方面：
    （一）我感觉到工会工作的主要缺点是未能做到“大家办工会”。工会共有十三、四个常务委员，但经常做工作的只有三、四个人。工会主席带有严重的事务主义作风，对于张三和李四吵嘴的一些小事，也都亲自解决，不能把主要力量用在领导生产上。其他委员也很少下车间。
    （二）工会干部不能很好地推行发展生产、劳资两利政策。对某些阻碍生产和关于工人群众利益的重大问题，如临时工改变为正式工的问题，不合理的劳动组织和工资制度问题，工会不能和资方协商解决，求得改进；工会对某些工人违犯劳动纪律的行为，也未能抓紧进行教育。
    （三）工会的民主生活很差。工会对生产积极的、执行工会任务很好的工友，不表扬鼓励，对坏的也不批评。工会小组应该经常开会，提高工人政治觉悟和研究改进生产，但有些单位已经半年没有开过小组会了。

    医务工作者自动输血给伤员编辑同志：
    华东工业部山东办事处卫生科职工医院工作人员，在科长陈振鳌同志影响下，踊跃地报名为重伤员崔玉德同志输血急救，挽救了伤员的生命。这件事情得到伤员所在厂全体职工的赞扬。
    山东某工厂装配部崔玉德同志，于五月十八日因发生爆炸事故，使下肢发生复杂骨拆，并发生局部坏死。大夫会诊认为必须裁肢。经过本人同意，领导上批准后，施行了手术。但由于该同志身体素弱，在受伤时出血过多，动手术后即发生神志昏迷现象，情况十分危险。此时，陈科长马上组织院内工作人员输血急救，他自己并第一个报名参加。在他的影响下，肃维民、徐本娥、计东明、牛溪均、贾光兴、王西海、王文卓、张维棣等同志均自愿输血给崔玉德同志。第二天上午又有曲修恒、胡兰生、张鹏吉、于力强、藉玉亲、张建民继续输献自己的血液。这样，就使得垂危的崔玉德同志迅速脱离了危险，保全了生命。医务工作人员这样高度的阶级友爱精神，深深的感动了某厂全体职工。

        河南省息县人民政府  关心群众疾病受到人民拥护编辑同志：
    五月初，息县防胡区的铁楼营、赵集两乡普遍发生疫症，流行很快。县人民政府知道后，马上组织城关的中西医张民权等六人前往抢救，经过几天突击治疗，共治好患麻疹的一百八十五人、患感冒的三十三人、患水痘的五人。当地群众反映：“人民政府真太关心咱了；咱有了啥困难，政府比我们还着急；想尽法子来解决。”一位老大娘说：“现在的医生也和气多了，看病也仔细！”
    现在该县人民政府为了预防夏季疫病流行，正有计划地开展群众性的夏季防疫卫生运动。

    为了大家医病方便  建议医院改变星期日休息制编辑同志：
    我对现在北京市公立医院工作，有两点意见。现在京市公立医院星期日一般的均不办公。各工厂、学校、机关的人员平时很忙，有点病常常总是等到星期天才能有时间去就诊，因此这就发生了一个矛盾。为了照顾大家的时间，我建议公立医院可以学习贸易公司、合作社、邮局、某些银行以及新华书店的办法，星期日照常办公，另订日子休息。有很多私立医院星期日就是照常办公的。
    现在一般医生治病，开方吃药就算了事，很少给病人讲一讲病源病名和药的名字以及应注意什么等等。有的医生对病人的询问也不愿答复。医生们所持的理由是怕讲出病的情况影响病人情绪。当然这可看具体情况作适当照顾，但在一般情况下我认为应当向病人讲清楚。因为这样可以提高人民的医药卫生知识水平，减少疾病。很多医生只管医病，不向病人解释说明病因和如何医治，实在是一种不好的作风，我觉得必须改进。

    税务干部耿恕调动工作时  组织群众欢送造成不良影响希有关机关检查处理编辑同志：
    皖北肥西县山南区山南税务稽征所副所长耿恕，最近奉命调职。他在走前竟示意街上干部组织群众“欢送”他。在走的前几天，他就让人请他吃酒饭、照相。有些同志向他提意见，他不听。五月十三日晨，他离开山南时，果然有一百五十多人“欢送”他，秧歌锣鼓，放枪放鞭炮，非常热闹。根据我们初步统计，“欢送”所费酒饭、照相、火药、爆竹等费用合米一千斤左右，并使一百五十多人的时间白白浪费。这件事情已经引起很多群众不满，造成严重不良的政治影响。
    希望有关机关对这件事进行检查处理。
