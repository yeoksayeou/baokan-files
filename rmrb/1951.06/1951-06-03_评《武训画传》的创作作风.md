Like the film "The Story of Wu Xun," "The Biography of Wu Xun" is a poisonous substance that distorts history, insults the revolution, and anesthetizes the people. It has nothing in common with the literary and artistic policy of "facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers" that the painter claims to uphold.

In the preface to "The Biography of Wu Xun," the author, Li Shizhao, declares: He and the painter, Sun Zhijun, "have re-collaborated on this biography of Mr. Wu Xun using the historical viewpoint of the people, hoping to correct all the incorrect statements of the past. In particular, we clearly point out that Mr. Wu Xun was the son of poor working people – a pioneer of the oppressed, humiliated, and harmed peasant class, abandoning some feudal or backward consciousness and viewpoints, and strengthening the basic spirit of 'labor creates the world' and promoting 'class friendship'." We cannot find evidence of these principles in the picture biography.

Wu Xun was born into a poor peasant family and suffered under the oppression of the landlord Li Laobian. He did not understand the fundamental reasons for being oppressed, nor did he understand the correct path to change his oppressed status. He simply attributed the reason to illiteracy, and therefore devoted his life to running "free schools," believing that literacy could solve all problems. Mainly under the leadership and support of landlords Guo Fen, military graduate Lou Junling, scholar Yang Shufang, county magistrate Guo Chunxu, governor Zhang Yao, monk Liao Zheng, and other figures who exploited and oppressed the people and suppressed the peasant revolutionary movement, he realized his wish to establish schools. Judging from his views and attitude towards feudal rulers, from his motives for establishing schools and the content of his teaching, and from the effects of his schooling, there were no irreconcilable fundamental differences between his understanding, actions, and the feudal rulers. He was not trying to shake the feudal rule, but to consolidate it. He had no revolutionary color at all. No matter how firm his ambition to establish schools, no matter how strange his methods of establishing schools, he could only be regarded as an ardent supporter of the feudal system and an active disseminator of feudal culture, with no revolutionary views or actions to speak of. This situation is fully proven by the materials in "The Biography of Mr. Wu Xun" compiled by the biographer Li Shizhao in 1948 and "Mr. Wu Xun, Who Begged for Education" compiled by Zhang Daoping in 1935. Even in the new picture biography, there are many materials that fully prove this. However, in this picture biography, the author not only fails to correctly express the materials to allow readers to understand the true face of Wu Xun; on the contrary, the picture biography goes to great lengths to embellish, turning black into red and ugly into beautiful. Such a good-for-nothing like Wu Xun is actually praised in liberated China as a "concrete practitioner of historical materialism" (author's preface), a "people's combat hero and labor model," and regarded as a "concrete representative figure of a peasant labor model in modern Chinese history" (painter's preface), asking the people to sing the praises of such a character, to emulate such a character, and hoping to produce many "New Wu Xuns" (same preface). Assuming the wheels of history would really turn backwards, assuming that the Chinese people, who have a high degree of political consciousness, rich fighting experience, and have won a great victory, all became "New Wu Xuns," accepted the so-called "Spirit of Wu Xun," and used this spirit to treat the madly aggressive American imperialists, the counter-revolutionary landlord class, and the lurking secret agents and bandits, then the future of the new China and the future of the world revolution would be unimaginable. Of course, like the film "The Story of Wu Xun," which once deceived the people, the picture biography cannot universally deceive the readers; the above assumptions are not realistic. Because the real broad masses of working people despise "bean curd brain" and will never follow his example. However, as literary and art workers who verbally claim to "face the workers, peasants, and soldiers" (picture biography preface), it is unacceptable to regard a "bean curd brain" character as a model to be emulated. In his review-like article "My Preliminary Understanding of the Errors of Worshiping and Promoting Wu Xun" today (May 31), the author believes that the reason for this error is due to insufficient historical knowledge and a lack of a "sufficiently scientific historical viewpoint" (as in the original text), committing "serious objectivism," as well as many other objective reasons, and good intentions in his subjective mind—such as taking Wu Xun out to cover up the democratic movement during the period of the Kuomintang reactionaries, etc., thus creating a mistaken understanding of Wu Xun. Is the reason for erroneously promoting Wu Xun merely due to "insufficient historical knowledge" or due to some kind of "objectivism"? No. The main reason is still the author's standpoint, praising and eulogizing figures who should be negated and criticized, and applying rouge and powder to them. In terms of artistic creation style, this is a complete violation of realism, and a degradation to conscious fabrication and lying, making one's own works a tool for deceiving and fooling readers. Knowing that something is ugly but still saying it is beautiful, insisting that black is red, is this just a matter of cognition?

To prove this point, let us read an article in Wu Xun's biography, Li Shizhao's own "Anecdotes of Mr. Wu Xun," to see what he once praised, which can also prove what he is still covering up in his self-criticism today. The following is what Zhang Sheng-san said, which is affirmatively recorded in the article.

"Once, early in the morning, my late father saw Wu Xun telling jokes to him and asked Wu Xun: 'Do you even know when it will rain?' He replied without hesitation, 'I know it will rain within two or three days.' My late father said, 'If it rains within three days, I will donate forty strings of cash to run a school!' Wu Xun asked very firmly: 'If it rains, I will come to get the money!' It did rain within three days, and my late father told my late mother, 'I was joking with Wu the day before yesterday, but now it has rained, and these forty strings of cash must be given to him!' My late father then asked me to bundle forty strings of cash, twenty strings in a bundle, divided into two bundles, in preparation for him to come and get it. A month later, he did come to get it, but it was too heavy to carry away. He told my late father, 'I already collected this money from you on the day it rained, and now I will deposit it here with you, please calculate interest at three percent.' My late father said, 'I should pay you forty strings of cash, please take it and give it to someone else to keep!' Wu Xun said, 'These forty strings of cash must be deposited here with you, and I will deposit more here when I have more money. If you don't agree, I will kowtow to you...'."

From this anecdote, we can see some of the economic sources of Wu Xun's schooling, and we can also see his means of getting money. The author of the picture biography once believed in this article that these anecdotes "deeply portray Mr. Wu Xun's personality," but they are actually more convenient than the picture biography for understanding this character of Wu Xun. However, these materials are now concealed and embellished in the "historical viewpoint of the people." The picture biography conceals Wu Xun's exploitative behavior in land transactions and goes to great lengths to embellish his lending behavior. Regardless of whose hands the loan passed through, Wu Xun was clearly a usurer of high interest. Moreover, most of the borrowers were peasants. However, on page ninety-eight of the picture biography, the author insists that he was a low-interest lender, and many picture pages say that Wu Xun enthusiastically provided relief, proving Wu Xun's "class friendship." Sun Qiufang clearly stated in "Records of the Educator Who Begged for Education—Wu Xun" that he accepted the court's grace—the yellow jacket. Regardless of whether this material is a legend or a historical fact, it is no different in essence from accepting the plaque of "benevolence and charity." Li Shizhao once admitted when compiling "The Biography of Mr. Wu Xun" that accepting the yellow jacket was a fact, but he overturned this fact when writing the picture biography, insisting on page 134 of the picture biography that Wu Xun refused the yellow jacket. "The imperial envoy asked him to kneel to listen to the 'imperial edict,' but he was unwilling to kneel down. He was asked to put on the yellow jacket, but he was unwilling to put it on." Is this "romanticism"? Unfortunately, there is no realistic basis. Wu Xun, who kowtowed everywhere, had a hard bone in the yellow jacket incident, so hard that he was not afraid of being beheaded; the court compromised before this "hard bone" and did not kill him, which is another "miracle." This kind of embellishment is unreasonable, but it clearly shows the purpose of the picture biography author: to turn ugly into beautiful and black into red. This cannot be explained by "serious objectivism."

The picture biography praises Wu Xun as an anti-superstition figure, repeatedly saying that he is anti-superstition. However, even in pages 45, 89, 91, and 97 of the picture biography, the author reveals himself, explaining that Wu Xun is a character who believes in fate and retribution, rather than a "pioneer." "Don't dislike much, don't dislike little, give some money to build a free school; you will be famous, you will do good deeds, Wen Chang Di Jun knows, and will teach your children and grandchildren to sit in eight-carried palanquins." This not only reveals Wu Xun's superstitious views, but also shows that Wu Xun believes that serving the emperor is "glorious." The author of this picture biography regards these as beautiful things to praise, where is the people's stand? The preface to the author opposes "far-fetched interpretations," but there are "far-fetched interpretations" everywhere in the picture biography, and it also reveals the feudal views of the picture biography author everywhere. The "matchmaker red" on page 84 not only fails to criticize the evils of arranged marriages, but also praises this action, applying rouge and powder and turning black into red. No matter how many beautiful words are written in the text of the picture biography to "elucidate" that the rulers praised Wu Xun in order to anesthetize the people (see pages 134, etc.), it still does not conceal the purpose of the picture biography author in "far-fetched interpretation" of what.

Page 50 of the picture biography clearly proves the author's dishonest attitude and style. After quoting Wu Xun's doggerel, he gave a beautiful explanation for Wu Xun's rogue attitude when asking for money—"...'Uncles and elders, don't be angry, I will leave when you are not angry.' This shows Wu Xun's grace and his perseverance of the fighting spirit." The picture biography author, who is too deeply influenced by the spirit of Wu Xun, please consider carefully when reviewing, why do you value the "perseverance of the fighting spirit" so little? Why is it necessary to give such a boring explanation to the "perseverance of the fighting spirit"?

The basic view that runs through the entire book is that it does not matter what content is used to educate the masses; it unilaterally emphasizes the importance of "popularizing education," that oppression and exploitation are mainly due to a lack of culture; that literacy is resistance to feudal rule, and that literacy can replace more important revolutionary practice; that what determines historical development is not the change in production relations, nor the change in the social system, but literacy, and that literacy determines everything. Where is there any trace of "historical materialism" in this view that exaggerates the importance of literacy? Believing that literacy is so important that it can replace more important political struggles, giving a distorted explanation of historical development, and, regardless of the content of the so-called popular education textbooks, what "historical viewpoint of the people" is this? We can say with certainty that rather than the author of the picture biography explaining what "historical viewpoint" through the description of Wu Xun's history, it is better to say that he has vulgarized the historical viewpoint. Rather than saying that they are praising the people, "abandoning feudal backward views," it is better to say that through the praise of Wu Xun, they are better praising the landlords and the claws of the emperors and uglifying the people, and applying rouge and powder to feudal views. Rather than saying that they are promoting revolution, it is better to say that they are affirming the views and actions of surrenderism. Rather than saying that they are attacking things that are already dead and are dying, it is better to say that they are protecting these things. Attacking individual landlords like Li Laobian while praising landlords bigger than Li Laobian, the effect is to better praise the landlord class. Praising Wu Xun for being valued by the court, the effect is to more beautifully praise the feudal rulers. Praising Wu Xun's "greatness" in establishing schools, the effect is to weaken the significance of the truly awakened peasants resisting the rulers and patriotic actions such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Nian Army. In the images of the pictures, the rulers who oppress, exploit, and slaughter the people appear very dignified, while the people have become ignorant, funny, and useless things (see pages 103, 133, 135, 139, 147, etc.). These are issues of understanding, but they also clearly contain issues of the author's standpoint, attitude, and style. The reasons for these errors are related to understanding, but also related to the author's standpoint, and related to the author's dishonest creative attitude and creative style. In order to help the author understand the root cause of the errors, it is particularly requested that the author not only not emphasize objective reasons, but also not simply consider the problem from the perspective of understanding methods, but also fundamentally eliminate the influence of Wu Xun in terms of standpoint and style.

　　评《武训画传》的创作作风
    王朝闻
    如同电影《武训传》一样，《武训画传》是一种歪曲历史、侮辱革命、麻醉人民的毒物。和画者所说“面向工农兵”文艺方针没有任何相同之点。
    《武训画传》著者李士钊在序言中宣称：他和画者孙之俊“用人民的历史观点重新为武训先生合作这一篇传记，希望能够纠正过去的一切附会的不正确的说法。特别明确的指出武训先生是一个穷苦的劳动人民的儿子——被压迫被污辱被残害的农民阶级的先觉者，扬弃了若干关于封建或落后的意识和观点，加强了‘劳动创造世界’和发扬‘阶级友爱’等几点基本精神”。这些道理，我们不能在画传上得到证实。
    武训出身贫农家庭，身受过地主李老辫的压迫。他不了解受压迫的基本原因，也不了解什么是改变被压迫地位的正确道路。把原因简单地归结为不识字，因而也就终身为办“义学”奔走，以为识字可以解决一切问题。主要在地主郭芬、武进士娄峻岭、进士杨树芳、知县郭春煦、巡抚张曜、和尚了证等等剥削人民压迫人民镇压农民革命运动的角色的领导与支持之下、实现了兴学的愿望。从他对待封建统治者的看法和态度来看，从他兴学的动机和教学内容来看，从他兴学的效果来看，他的认识、行动和封建统治者之间没有不相容的基本的分歧。不是为了动摇封建统治，而是巩固着封建统治。任何革命色彩也没有的。不论兴学的志愿多么坚定，不论兴学的手段多么奇诡，仍然只能算是封建制度的热烈拥护者，封建文化的积极传播者，谈不到什么革命的观点和行动。这种情形，画传的著者李士钊在一九四八年所编的《武训先生的传记》和一九三五年张道平编著的《行乞兴学的“武训先生”》等等材料就有充分的证明。就是在新的画传里面，也有许多材料充分证明。可是在这画传里面，作者不仅不根据材料正确加以表现，使读者能够从画传认识武训的真面目；正相反，画传极尽粉饰的能事，把黑的说成红的，丑的说成美的。武训这样的脓包，在解放了的中国，竟被颂扬成为“具体的历史唯物主义的身体力行者”（著者序），成为“人民的战斗英雄和劳动模范”，被当做“中国近代历史上的一个农民劳动模范的具体代表人物”（画者序），要人民歌颂这样一个角色，效法这样一个角色，并且希望产生许许多多《新武训》（同上序）。假定历史车轮真会向后转，假定已经具有高度政治觉悟和拥有丰富斗争经验而且取得了伟大胜利的中国人民都变成了《新武训》，接受了所谓“武训精神”，并用这种精神来对待疯狂侵略的美帝国主义者，对待反革命的地主阶级和暗藏的特务匪徒，那么，新中国的前途和世界革命的前途就不堪设想。不成问题，如同曾经一度蒙蔽人民的电影《武训传》一样，画传也不可能普遍地蒙蔽读者；上述的假定是没有现实性的。因为真正的广大的劳动人民是看不起“豆沫”，绝不会向他看齐的。但是，作为在口头上愿意“面向工农兵”（画传序）的文艺工作者，把一个“豆沫”式的角色当成应当效法的模范，这就不能容许。画传著者在今天（五月三十一日）的检讨式的文章《我初步认识了崇拜与宣扬武训的错误》里，认为产生这种错误的原因，由于历史知识不够，“历史观点不够科学”（原文如此），犯了“严重的客观主义”，以及其他许许多多的客观原因，和主观上的好意——为了在国民党反动派时期把武训拿出来掩护民主运动等等，因而造成了对武训的错误认识。造成错误地宣扬武训的原因，是不是仅仅由于“历史知识不够”，由于什么“客观主义”？不是的。主要地还是由于作者的立场问题，对应当否定、批判的人物加以表扬、歌颂，替他擦粉涂金。在艺术创作作风上讲，这是完全违背现实主义，而堕落到有意识的伪造和说谎的地步，使自己的作品成为欺骗与愚弄读者的工具。明知是丑的也要说是美的，黑的硬要说是红的，这难道仅仅是认识上的问题？
    为了证明这一论点，我们读读武训的传记中的一篇文章，李士钊自己的《武训先生的轶事》，看他曾经歌颂了什么，也就可以证明今天他在自我检讨中还掩饰了什么。下面是该文所肯定地记录着的张省三的说话。
    “有一次天早的时候，先严见到武训同他说笑话，问武训：‘什么时候下雨，你也知道不？’他毫不犹疑的回答说：‘我知道两三天内有雨。’先严说：‘如果三天以内下了雨，我捐四十吊钱办学校！’武训很坚决的问：‘下了雨我就来拿钱！’三天之内果然下了雨，先严告诉先母说：‘我前天同武某人说笑话，现在果然下了雨，这四十吊钱，非给他不可！’先严乃叫我捆四十吊制钱，二十吊一捆分为两捆，预备他来拿。一个月以后，他果然来拿，因为太重拿不走。他告诉先严说：‘下雨的那天，我早就收了你这笔钱了，现在就把它存到你这里，请按三分行息。’先严说：‘我应该付你四十吊钱，请你拿去交给别人收放吧！’武训说：‘这四十吊钱，一定存到你这里，我再有钱时还要往这里存。你要不答应，我就给你磕头………。’”
    从这段轶事里，我们可以看出武训兴学的某些经济来源，也可以看得出他搞钱的手段。画传著者曾经在这篇文章中认为“深切地刻画出武训先生的人格”的这些轶事，实在比画传更便于认识武训这一个角色。但这些材料，今天都在“人民的历史观点”中被掩盖和粉饰了。画传掩盖着武训在田房交易上的剥削行为，在放债行为上极尽粉饰的能事。不问放债经谁的手，武训明明是一个高利贷的放债者。而且借债的多是农民。画传作者却在九十八页上硬说他是低利贷者，而且不少画页说武训热心救济，证明武训的“阶级友爱”。孙秋方在《记行乞兴学的教育家——武训》里，分明说是接受了朝廷的恩赏——黄马褂。不问这一材料是传说还是史实，和接受“乐善好施”的匾额比较，没有本质上的区别。李士钊曾经在编《武训先生传记》时承认了接受黄马褂是事实，在著画传时却推翻了这一事实，在画传第一三四页上硬说武训拒绝了黄马褂。“钦差叫他跪下听‘圣旨’，他不愿意跪下，叫他穿上黄马褂，他也不愿意穿。”这是“浪漫主义”吧？可惜毫无现实根据。处处叩头的武训在黄马褂事件上的骨头就硬了，硬到不怕杀头的程度；朝廷在这一“硬骨头”之前妥协，不杀他的头，又是一个“奇迹”。这种粉饰是不合理的，但也就分明看得出画传著者的目的：丑的说成美的，黑的说成红的。这不是“严重的客观主义”所能解释的。
    画传把武训当成一个反迷信的人物来歌颂，一再说他反迷信。但就是在画传四十五、八十九、九十一、九十七等页中，也就分明露出了尾巴，说明了武训是相信命运相信报应的角色，而不是什么“先觉”。“不嫌多，不嫌少，舍些金钱修义学；又有名，又行好，文昌帝君知道了，准教你子子孙孙坐八抬大轿。”这不仅透露了武训的迷信观点，也看得出武训认为给帝王服务是“光荣”。对于这些画传作者是当成美的东西来歌颂着的，人民的立场到那里去了？著者序文中反对“牵强附会”，画传中却随处有“牵强附会”的表现，也随处透露着画传作者的封建观点。八十四页的“做媒红”，不仅不批判包办婚姻的罪恶，而且歌颂这种行动，擦粉涂金，把黑的说成红的。不论在画传的文字中写上了多少漂亮的词句来“阐明”统治者表扬武训是为了麻醉人心（见一三四等页），可仍然没有掩盖画传作者“牵强附会”地宣传什么的目的。
    画传五○页明显地证明作者不老实的态度和作风。在引用了武训的打油诗之后，为武训要钱时的流氓态度作了漂亮的解释——“……‘大爷大叔别生气，你几时不生气，俺几时就出去’。由此可见武训的雅量和他的坚韧不拔的斗争精神。”武训精神影响太深的画传著者，请在检讨的时候，仔细考虑，为什么把“坚韧不拔的斗争精神”看得这样不值钱？为什么必要把“坚韧不拔的斗争精神”作这样无聊的解释？
    贯串全书的基本观点，是不问拿什么内容来教育群众；片面强调“普及教育”的重要意义，被压迫被剥削主要由于缺乏文化；识字就是反抗封建统治，识字可以代替更重要的革命实践；决定历史发展的不是生产关系的改变，不是社会制度的改变，而是识字，识字决定了一切。这种夸大识字的重要性的观点那里有一点“历史唯物论”的气息？以为识字重要到可以代替更重要的政治斗争，对历史的发展作了歪曲的解释，而且，不管所谓普及教育的教材内容，这有什么“人民的历史观点”？我们可以肯定地说：与其以为画传作者通过了武训历史的描写阐明了什么“历史观点”，不如说把历史观点加以庸俗化。与其说他们在歌颂着人民，“扬弃了封建落后的观点”，不如说通过了对于武训的歌颂，更好地在歌颂着地主和帝王的爪牙而丑化了人民，并给封建的观点搽粉涂金。与其说在宣传革命，不如说在肯定投降主义的观点和行动。与其说在攻击已经死亡和正在死亡的事物，不如说是在保护这些事物。打击了个别地主李老辫而歌颂着比李老辫更大的地主，效果上是更好地歌颂了地主阶级。歌颂武训受到朝廷的重视，效果上是更美地歌颂了封建统治者。歌颂武训兴学的“伟大”，效果上是削弱太平天国和捻军等真正觉悟了的农民反抗统治者和爱国行动的意义。在图画的形象上，压迫、剥削、屠杀人民的统治者显得很庄严，人民却成了愚昧、滑稽、没出息的东西（见一○三、一三三、一三五、一三九、一四七等页）。这些，是认识上的问题，同时也分明包含着作者的立场、态度和作风的问题。产生这些错误的原因，和认识有关，也和作者的立场有关，和作者的不老实的创作态度创作作风有关。为了帮助作者认识错误的根源，特别要求作者，不仅不要强调客观原因，而且不要单纯从认识方法上考虑问题，而且要从根本立场、作风上清除武训影响。
