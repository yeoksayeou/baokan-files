This combat friendship between the Chinese and German peoples is solid and unshakable. May the "Sino-German Friendship Month" become the starting point for further friendly cooperation between the Chinese and German peoples, and may the political, economic, and cultural ties between the two countries be further developed and consolidated -- this will greatly benefit the final victory of the world peace and democracy cause."
