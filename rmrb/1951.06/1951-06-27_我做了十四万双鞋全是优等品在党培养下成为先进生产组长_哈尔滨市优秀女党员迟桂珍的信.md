Dear Chairman Mao:

I am truly overjoyed to be commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Party's founding.

Currently, our entire factory is enthusiastically launching a campaign to donate airplanes and cannons. Our team has decided to purchase airplanes and cannons by donating voluntary wages. I myself will also donate my team leader allowance. At the same time, our team will revise our patriotic pledge, conduct a thorough quality inspection to ensure no second-class products are produced, and reduce waste to increase national income. To commemorate the Party's birthday, I must do this work well.

I am a girl from a poor family. From a young age, I picked up coal cinders and pasted matchboxes. I suffered all kinds of hardships. My family was so poor that we didn't even have a complete set of pots, bowls, and ladles. When I was twelve years old, I went to work in a Japanese candy factory, still wearing my mother's pants. In those days, life was truly hard for poor people!

Not long after "August 15th," I started working in one of our rubber shoe factories. I saw how well the factory director treated us workers, and the factory truly treated us workers as human beings. They also led us to learn culture, and our lives improved day by day. I no longer suffered abuse at work. I felt that the Communist Party was truly good. When I worked, I thought: I should make shoes better for our own factory; I can't just aim for speed and make more money; if I don't understand something technically, I should learn from others. In this way, in more than four years, I made a total of 140,000 pairs of shoes, all of which were excellent products. The Party has been caring for me and encouraging me during these four years, enabling me to strive to ensure quality.

After I was promoted to team leader, the Party taught me to first play a model role in the team and to do a good job with the team. However, at the time, I felt that the team was too big and I was too young, and some workers in the team were relatively backward. Although I worked hard myself, I couldn't improve the team's unity. I felt helpless. At this time, the Party taught me again to unite the masses and overcome difficulties. I implemented the Party's teachings, and the team's unity problem was solved. With everyone's efforts, the quality of all the team's products has consistently been guaranteed as first-class.

Last year on "May Day," I was elected as a city-level labor model; at the same time, our team was also elected as an advanced team.

Dear Chairman Mao, when I was rewarded, I felt honored. This is the Party's teaching, the Party's cultivation, which has enabled me, a poor child who suffered, to become a Communist Party member, the leader of an advanced production team, and to be elected as a city-level labor model. This honor belongs to the Party, to the beloved Chairman Mao. Dear Chairman Mao, I must continue to work hard and create greater achievements in production to bring honor to the Party.

I wish you good health!

Chi Guizhen
Advanced Production Team Leader, Harbin Rubber Factory

　　我做了十四万双鞋全是优等品在党培养下成为先进生产组长
    ——哈尔滨市优秀女党员迟桂珍的信敬爱的毛主席：
    在纪念党的三十周年生日的时候，我真有说不出的高兴。
    现在我们全厂热烈展开了捐献飞机大炮运动，我们小组决定用捐献义务工资的办法，购买飞机大炮。我自己还要将小组长津贴捐献出来。同时，我们小组还要修订爱国公约，搞好质量大检查，保证不出二等品，并减少浪费，给国家增加收入。为了纪念党的生日，我一定要作好这项工作。我是个穷人家里的女孩子，从小就捡煤核、糊洋火盒，什么苦都受了。家里穷的锅碗瓢勺都不全。我十二岁那年，进一家日本糖果工厂去作工，还是穿着我妈的一条裤子呢。那时候，穷人的日子真不好过哪！“八一五”后不久，我进到咱们一个胶鞋工厂作工，看到厂长对我们工人那么好，工厂真将咱工人当人待，又领导我们学文化，生活也一天一天好起来了，作工再也不受气了。我觉得共产党真好。干起活来我就想：给咱自己工厂作鞋，应该做得更好，不能光图快，多赚钱；技术上不明白，就好好向别人学。就这样，在四年多的时间，我共做了十四万双鞋，全是优等品。党在这四年里一直是关怀我，鼓励我，使我努力保证质量。我被提拔作了小组长以后，党教导我先在小组里起模范作用，把小组搞好。但是，当时我觉得小组太大，我自己太年轻，同时小组里个别工友还比较落后。虽然我自己努力生产，但是小组团结总搞不好。我就感到没有办法了。这时党又教导我，要团结群众，克服困难。我实现了党的教导，小组的团结问题解决了。在大家的努力下，全组产品质量一直保证了一等品。
    在去年“五一”，我当选为全市劳动模范；同时，我们小组也当选为先进小组。
    敬爱的毛主席，当我被奖励的时候，我感到光荣。这是党的教导，党的培养，使我这样一个受苦的穷孩子，成为一个共产党员、先进生产小组的组长，当选了全市的劳动模范。这光荣是党的，是敬爱的毛主席的。敬爱的毛主席，我一定要不断地努力，在生产上创造更大的成绩，为党争光。
  祝您身体健康！
    哈尔滨市橡胶工厂先进生产小组长  迟桂珍
