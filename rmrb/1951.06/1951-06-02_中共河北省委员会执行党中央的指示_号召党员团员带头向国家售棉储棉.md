This is not only an economic issue, but also a serious political task. To this end, the Provincial Committee hereby calls on all party members and league members to resolutely implement it, and in cotton-producing areas, in conjunction with the in-depth development of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to carry out a mass patriotic cotton selling and storing movement, specifically carrying out the following tasks: (1) Local party committees, municipal committees, county committees, and district committees in cotton-producing areas, and rural branches, should immediately hold various meetings to discuss the Central Committee's instructions, combine them with current work, organize forces according to the size of the local cotton purchasing and storing task, arrange and promote them concretely according to the methods stipulated by the Central Committee, and vigorously implement them level by level. Rural branches in cotton-producing areas should immediately convene general meetings of all party members and league members to implement the Central Committee's instructions on cotton purchasing and storing work, launch widespread propaganda and education activities among cotton farmers, and promote the spirit of patriotism, respond to the Party's call with their own exemplary actions, and take the lead in selling and storing cotton to the state first. This is a concrete action to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. (2) Party members and league members working in various departments and organizations, in addition to studying the instructions of the Central Committee and how to specifically combine them with their own work, should write letters to their families and relatives and friends in cotton-producing areas or who have social relations in cotton-producing areas, and mobilize them to sell or store their existing cotton to the state. (3) Party members and league members working in economic departments related to cotton purchasing (such as companies, banks, and cooperatives) should work actively, be familiar with their business, simplify procedures, strengthen organizational work, ensure the supply of materials, pay attention to listening to the demands and feedback of the masses, and improve their business at any time to facilitate the progress of cotton purchasing and storing work and ensure the completion of the task.
