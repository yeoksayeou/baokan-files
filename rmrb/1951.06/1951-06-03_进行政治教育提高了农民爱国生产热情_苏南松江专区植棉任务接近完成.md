Political Education Enhances Farmers' Patriotic Production Enthusiasm
Sunan Songjiang Special District Approaching Completion of Cotton Planting Task

The Sunan Songjiang Special District is a major cotton-producing area in Sunan. This year's cotton planting task is 1.9 million mu, an increase of 510,000 mu compared to last year. As of early May, most areas had completed more than 80% of the planting task; according to the planting situation in various places, it is estimated that the final figure may exceed the task, reaching more than 2 million mu.

The six counties under the jurisdiction of this special district, including Shanghai and Nanhui, used to plant cotton and rice in a general ratio of 7:3. During the period of Japanese invaders and Kuomintang rule, the puppet government lowered cotton prices and controlled rice, so when farmers sold cotton, the cotton price was low, but when they sold cotton to buy rice, the rice price often increased. Coupled with various natural disasters, cotton farmers could not maintain their livelihoods by growing cotton, so the cotton planting area decreased year by year. By 1947, it had been reduced to a 3:7 ratio of cotton to rice. Last year, the local people's government helped cotton farmers solve practical difficulties and ensured an appropriate parity between cotton and grain, so cotton farmers had gained real benefits. However, because the historical lessons of the past still left a deep impact, cotton farmers still had concerns about expanding cotton fields this year. Many township cadres and farmers said: "In the past, planting cotton was a gamble. Last year, planting cotton was profitable. This year, we don't know if planting more is a good idea." In order to help farmers make up their minds and complete the cotton planting task, the special district carried out the following work.

Conducting Political Mobilization Combined with Economic Accounting: The Masses All Understand Why They Should Plant Cotton

After analysis and research, the Communist Party organizations and government agencies in the special district first grasped the current new situation and characteristics of the district: First, land reform was completed, farmers' production enthusiasm was high, and they actively responded to the government's call. Second, the cotton-producing counties are close to Shanghai, and most agricultural products are commercialized. As long as farmers know what crops are cost-effective to grow, they will grow them. Based on this situation, the district paid attention to combining political mobilization with economic accounting from the beginning of the work of mobilizing farmers to plant cotton. In the anti-US aggression and aid-Korea movement, when accusation meetings were held in various places, cotton-producing areas paid attention to guiding farmers to recall the reasons for past cotton planting failures and compare the significance and benefits of planting cotton today. After accusations, recollections, and comparisons, the masses' political awareness greatly improved. Leading cadres promptly carried out further patriotic ideological education, and also used various occasions and forms to widely publicize the policy of rewarding cotton planting. They put forward slogans such as "Planting more cotton is patriotism" and "Now that the land belongs to us, let's plant a few more mu of cotton," and launched a mass cotton planting accounting movement. After such publicity and education, ordinary farmers can correctly answer the question of why they should plant cotton: First, planting more cotton can increase national strength; second, planting more cotton means Shanghai textile factories can all start operating; third, planting cotton can improve their own lives.

Fighting Against Reactionary Landlords and Secret Agents: Farmers' Worries Eliminated, Cotton Planting Enthusiasm Even Higher

After the previous stage of ideological mobilization, when districts and townships discussed cotton planting tasks and made plans for each household, they found that farmers still had concerns: namely, they were afraid that if too much cotton was planted, the price would be difficult to guarantee, that grain and fertilizer would not be supplied, and that there would be too much rain and no harvest, or too many insects and no way to control them. Therefore, the counties and districts organized cotton farmers' forums to use practical examples of overcoming natural disasters to show that too much rain and insect pests were not terrible, and also explained that carrying out pre-purchase work could guarantee cotton prices and the supply of grain and fertilizer. When cotton farmers' concerns were gradually eliminated, reactionary landlords and secret agents spread rumors everywhere, such as "If the southwest wind blows on the seventeenth day of the first month, nine mu of cotton fields out of ten will be empty; if the southwest wind blows on the seventeenth day of the second month, nine mu of cotton fields out of ten will be strong; if the southwest wind blows on the seventeenth day of the third month, nine mu of cotton fields out of ten will be infested with insects," affecting the cotton planting confidence of a few farmers. At this time, combined with the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, rumors were exposed and superstitions were broken. For example, landlord Jin You-tang burned incense and prayed, "Whoever plants cotton will be poor, and when Chiang and the Americans come, everything will turn upside down," and was sent to court by farmers after being discovered. In this way, farmers were further educated in the struggle against secret agents, clearly recognized that planting cotton was both patriotic and beneficial to themselves, and automatically held family meetings to make plans, and planted cotton planting signs on the cotton fields - those planted on the land divided after land reform were called "emancipation cotton," those planted with foreign cotton were called "resist-America cotton," and those converted from rice and bean fields were called "build-a-family-and-nation cotton"; and they actively increased investment in cotton planting. In the past, cotton fields were rarely fertilized or not fertilized at all. This year, cotton fields in Jiading, Baoshan, Nanhui, Shanghai and other counties have increased fertilization by an average of one time compared to last year.

Inspecting Sowing Preparations and Solving Sowing Difficulties: The Entire District Enthusiastically Launched a Cotton Planting Competition Movement

In order to ensure the completion of cotton farmers' cotton planting plans, in late April, the counties in the special district organized cotton planting guidance committees (composed of district and township cadres and experienced old farmers) and a large number of cadres from district, towns, and grassroots cooperatives to go deep into the villages for inspection and help solve sowing difficulties. During the inspection, it was found that many households in Jiading County had not obtained the consent of women for their plans; however, most of the farm work such as sowing, weeding, pest control, and cotton picking was done by women. If the women did not agree, the original plan would be difficult to achieve. Therefore, women's meetings and family meetings were organized for discussion, which improved women's production enthusiasm. The inspection also found that because cotton fields were heavily fertilized, some farmers felt that the fertilizer for rice fields was being squeezed, so they hesitated to increase fertilizer for cotton fields. Therefore, the masses were mobilized to check each other's preparations for fertilizer, seeds, and farm implements, and register them household by household; the cooperatives purchased fertilizer on their behalf, or the pre-purchase of cotton was used to solve the problem. For example, the Shanghai County Cooperative, in addition to completing the original task of 2 billion yuan of fertilizer loans (issuing fertilizer cakes), also supplied more than 3,500 fertilizer cakes during the inspection, and promoted pre-purchase work. After these specific difficulties were resolved, a cotton planting challenge competition was launched between villages and villages, streets and streets, households and households, and women and women. The competition conditions were: 1. Complete the cotton planting plan and strive to exceed it; 2. Prepare the land and drain water, sow on time, apply more fertilizer, and select good seeds; 3. Replenish seedlings, protect seedlings, and weed in time. The cotton planting competition movement in the entire district was launched vigorously under these conditions, successfully completed the sowing task, and the masses' political awareness was also improved in the production movement.

### 进行政治教育提高了农民爱国生产热情  苏南松江专区植棉任务接近完成

　　进行政治教育提高了农民爱国生产热情
    苏南松江专区植棉任务接近完成
    苏南松江专区是苏南主要产棉区，今年植棉任务为一百九十万亩，较去年增加五十一万亩。五月上旬，大部地区已完成播种任务百分之八十以上；根据各地播种情况估计，最后可能超过任务，达到二百万亩以上。
    该专区所辖上海、南汇等六县，过去种植面积一般的比例是棉七稻三。在日寇和国民党统治时代，由于伪政府压低棉价、统制食米，农民在出售棉花时，花价偏低，卖了花买米时，米价往往提高，加上各种自然灾害的袭击，棉农靠种花不能维持生活，因此种棉面积逐年减少。到一九四七年，已缩减到棉三稻七。去年，当地人民政府帮助棉农解决实际困难，又保证了棉粮适当比价，棉农已得到实际利益，但因过去的历史教训还留下深刻的影响，所以棉农对今年扩大棉田还有顾虑。许多乡干部和农民这样说：“过去种棉赌运气，去年种棉有了利，今年多种没主意。”为了帮助农民打定主意，完成植棉任务，该专区进行了以下的一些工作。
    进行政治动员结合经济算账  群众都知道了为什么要种棉
    该专区中共党组织及政府机关经过分析研究，首先掌握了该区目前新的情况和特点：第一，土地改革完成，农民生产情绪高涨，积极响应政府号召。第二，产棉县份紧靠上海市，农业生产品绝大部分商品化，只要农民知道种什么作物合算，就会种什么。从这个情况出发，该区在动员农民植棉的工作中，一开始就注意了政治动员结合经济算账。在抗美援朝运动当中，各地召开控诉会时，各棉区都注意引导农民回忆过去种棉花失利的原因，并对比今天种棉花的意义和利益。经过了控诉、回忆、对比，群众政治觉悟大为提高。领导干部及时进行了进一步的爱国主义思想教育，同时并利用各种场合、各种形式，普遍宣传奖励植棉的政策。提出“多种棉花就是爱国”和“土地归了家，多种几亩花”等口号，并展开了群众性的植棉算账运动。经过这样的宣传教育，一般农民都能正确地回答出为什么要种棉花的问题：一、多种棉花就可以增加国家力量；二、多种棉花上海纱厂就都能开工；三、种棉花自己的生活可以改善。
    与反动地主和特务作斗争  农民顾虑消除种棉热情更高
    经过前一段的思想发动，各区、乡在讨论植棉任务及按户打谱时，发现农民还有顾虑：即怕花种多了价难保，怕粮食肥料得不到供应，怕雨多不收花、虫多无法治等。各县、区因此又组织棉农座谈会，用克服自然灾害的实际例子，说明雨多、虫害并不可怕，又说明开展预购工作可以保证棉花价格和粮食、肥料的供应。当棉农顾虑逐渐消除时，反动地主和特务又到处散播“正月十七西南风，十亩棉田九亩空；二月十七西南风，十亩棉田九亩雄；三月十七西南风，十亩棉田九亩虫”等谣言，影响了少数农民植棉信心。这时又结合镇压反革命工作，揭破谣言和破除迷信。如地主金友堂焚香祷告“谁种棉花谁受贫，蒋美来了大翻身”，被农民发觉后将他扭送法庭。这样，农民在反特务斗争中，进一步受到了教育，明确地认识到种棉花又爱国又利己，自动开家庭会订计划，纷纷将种花地插了植棉牌——在土地改革后分得的地上种的叫“翻身棉”，种洋棉的田叫“抗美棉”，用稻田、豆田改种的叫“兴家建国棉”；并积极增加植棉投资。过去棉田施肥很少或不施肥，今年嘉定、宝山、南汇、上海等县棉田，均比去年平均增肥一倍。
            检查播种准备解决播种困难  全区热烈展开植棉竞赛运动
    为了确保棉农植棉计划的完成，专区各县在四月下旬，组织各县的区植棉指导委员会（由区乡干部和有植棉经验的老农组成）和区、镇及基层合作社的大批干部，深入各村进行检查，并帮助解决播种困难。检查中，发现嘉定县许多户定计划没有通过妇女同意；而播种、锄草、打虫、摘花等农活大部都是妇女担任的，如妇女不同意，原计划就难实现。因此，又组织妇女会、家庭会讨论。提高了妇女的生产情绪。检查中又发现因棉田施肥多，有的农民感到挤了稻田肥料，因而对棉田增肥有了犹豫。因此又发动群众互相检查肥料、种籽、农具等准备情况，并逐户登记；由合作社代购肥料，或用预购棉花办法解决。如上海县合作社，除完成原任务二十亿元的肥料贷款（发放肥饼）外，又在检查中供给肥饼三千五百多片，并推行了预购工作。在这些具体困难解决后，即发动了村与村、街与街、户与户、妇女与妇女的植棉挑战竞赛。竞赛条件是：一、完成植棉计划并争取超过；二、整地排水按时播种，多施肥料，选好种籽；三、补苗保苗，及时锄草。全区的植棉竞赛运动，在这些条件下轰轰烈烈地开展起来，胜利地完成了播种任务，而且群众的政治觉悟也在生产运动中同时提高了。
