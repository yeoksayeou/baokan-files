Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: The London Daily Worker commented in an editorial on the 15th on the Soviet note regarding the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan, saying: The basic spirit of the Soviet note is to insist that existing agreements, which the UK and the U.S. also signed, must be observed when drafting a peace treaty with Japan. This means adhering to the Potsdam Declaration and the Yalta Agreement, which permanently eradicate Japanese militarism, and the Cairo Declaration, which guarantees the return of Taiwan to China.

The editorial continued: The U.S. proposal violates all these agreements. The U.S. proposal is also a threat to Britain. For their own interests, the British people should oppose the U.S. proposal and support the Soviet proposal to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet government insists that the final treaty should be drafted in accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, the Cairo Declaration, and the Yalta Agreement. This is the only treaty basis that can truly guarantee British interests and British security.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th: Many Indian newspapers prominently published summaries of the "Soviet Government's Opinion on the U.S. Draft Peace Treaty with Japan." The Calcutta progressive newspaper The Independent published an editorial on the 13th saying: "People all over the world know that this draft drawn up by the U.S. government is illegal, it despises all international agreements, and treats the United Nations Charter as a scrap of paper."

The editorial wrote: The Potsdam Agreement stipulates that the U.S., the Soviet Union, the UK, and China should jointly draft the peace treaty with Japan. The U.S. government has abandoned this point. The U.S. draft peace treaty not only does not include any provisions to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism, but also gives Japanese militarists the right to rearm under the guise of "defense."

The editorial pointed out: U.S. war-mongers are paving the way for preparing for war in the name of a peace treaty with Japan. The editorial concluded: "The Indian people cannot tolerate this U.S. conspiracy to oppose China under the guise of a peace treaty with Japan."

The Delhi newspaper The Invincible also published an editorial, denouncing the U.S. conspiracy to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and rearm Japan. The newspaper believes that the Soviet proposal is "completely reasonable" and "a step towards world peace."

　　英印进步舆论反对美国单独对日媾和        
    坚决拥护苏联政府对日和约建议
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】十五日的伦敦工人日报在社论中评论苏联关于美国对日和约的照会说：苏联照会的基本精神是坚持在起草对日和约时，必须遵守英美也签过字的现有各种协定。这就是坚持永久肃清日本军国主义的波茨坦公告与雅尔塔协定，以及保证把台湾归还中国的开罗宣言。
    社论又说：美国的建议违犯了所有这些协定。美国的建议也是对英国的威胁。英国人民为了他们自己的利益，应该反对美国的建议，支持苏联所提出的缔结全面对日和约的建议。苏联政府坚持最后的条约应该根据波茨坦公告、开罗宣言与雅尔塔协定的精神起草。这是可以真正保障英国利益与英国安全的唯一的条约基础。
    【新华社新德里十八日电】印度许多报纸都用显著地位刊载《苏联政府关于美国对日和约草案的意见书》的摘要。加尔各答进步报纸《独立报》十三日发表社论说：“全世界人民都知道，美国政府所拟订的这个草案是非法的，它蔑视一切国际协定，并把联合国宪章当作一张废纸。”
    社论写道：波茨坦协定规定，美、苏、英、中四国应共同拟订对日和约。美国政府却背弃了这点。美国对日和约草案不但没有包括任何制止日本军国主义复活的条款，反而给日本军国主义者以权利，使他们假借“防御”的名义重新武装。
    社论指出：美国战争贩子在对日和约的名义下，正在为准备战争开辟道路。社论最后说：“美国这种假借对日和约的名义从事反对中国的阴谋，是印度人民所不能容忍的。”
    德里《无敌报》也发表社论，斥责美国单独对日媾和与重新武装日本的阴谋。该报认为：苏联的建议，“完全合乎道理”，并且“是走向世界和平的一个步骤。”
