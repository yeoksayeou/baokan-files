　　Welcoming the Communist Party's Birthday: Resolutely Follow Chairman Mao
To the Editor:
    "July 1st" is almost here. On the eve of this "July 1st," I celebrate the great victory of the Party, respectfully wish good health to the Party's leaders Chairman Mao, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and congratulate the people of all China led by the Party.
    I am a liberated farmer in the suburbs of Beijing, and I have honorably joined the Communist Party of China.
    Before liberation, I suffered from the landlord's cruel oppression. My family's few acres of land were seized by the landlord. My mother was forced to work for others, and I ran a small business selling used clothes to make a living. We were often hungry and cold, and I didn't have cotton clothes to wear for three consecutive winters.
    "The sun rises red in the east, the lives of the poor see the light." In December 1948, the Communist Party came, and in the winter of 1949, land reform was implemented. I joined the Farmers' Association and, under the leadership of the Party and the government, resolutely struggled against the landlord class. Landlords have many tricks to make trouble. They say they are "laboring landlords"—can there be "laboring landlords" in the world?! The landlords used money, grain, and cloth to buy me off, but I exposed their conspiracies time and time again. After the land reform, we were liberated politically and economically, and then everyone demanded cultural liberation. We peasants were oppressed in the past, and most of us were illiterate. Take the Youth League members in our village, for example: eighteen out of twenty-five members were illiterate. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the government, our village established a winter school, and 70% of the young farmers in the village went to school. Many old farmers and cadres also participated in the study. Later, the winter school was transformed into a perennial farmers' school, and even now, more than forty people participate in the study every day. The best students have learned more than 3,000 characters, and the worst have learned 500 characters. Deputy Village Head Zhang Chun used to not even be able to write his own name, but now he can read general news in the People's Daily. Therefore, our village's winter school was selected as one of the model winter schools in the city.
    We not only lead the farmers in carrying out land reform and attending winter school, but we also lead the farmers to work hard to increase production and resist America and aid Korea. This year, our entire village has set a patriotic production increase plan of 5% to 10%. The original plan was to apply three carts of fertilizer per mu, but now it has reached three and a half carts per mu. This spring was dry with little rain, so we promptly called on the masses to plant early and harvest early. Three days before Labor Day, more than 90% of the land in the village was planted. Now the seedlings are growing very tall, and most have been hoed twice and fertilized. In the future, we must work harder to produce more grain, donate airplanes and artillery, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive to defeat American imperialism as soon as possible.
    In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, our village recently held a people's representative meeting to discuss the village's production work, formulate a patriotic pact, and elect cadres for the village government. Everyone elected me as the village head.
    I know that these achievements are all due to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Without Chairman Mao and without the Communist Party, we could not have such a good life now. We, the farmers of the whole village, resolutely follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, do a good job, produce more grain, support the front, defeat American imperialism, build a new socialist countryside, and learn from the Soviet Union to establish collective farms in the future, cultivate the land with machines, and live a happy life like the Soviet farmers.

### 北京郊区辛四村农民迎接共产党的生日  坚决跟着毛主席走

    北京郊区辛四村农民
　　迎接共产党的生日  坚决跟着毛主席走编辑同志：
    眼看“七一”就到了。在此“七一”前夕，我庆贺党的伟大胜利，敬祝党的领袖毛主席、刘少奇、周恩来、朱总司令诸同志好，庆贺党领导的全中国人民好。
    我是北京郊区一个翻身农民，我已经光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    在解放以前，我受地主残酷的压迫，我家仅有的几亩地被地主霸占了。我母亲被迫给人作工，我跑小市，卖估衣维持生活。我们时常挨饿受冻，我接连三个冬天都没有穿上棉衣。
    “太阳出来东方红，穷人的日子见光明”，一九四八年十二月来了共产党，一九四九年冬天就实行了土地改革。我参加了农民协会，在党和政府领导下，坚决同地主阶级作斗争。地主捣鬼的方法可多啦，他们说自己是“劳动地主”，天下会有“劳动地主吗”？！地主们用金钱、粮食、布来收买我，我一次一次地揭穿了他们的阴谋诡计。土地改革以后，我们在政治经济上翻身了，于是大家又要求文化翻身。我们农民过去受压迫，大部分不识字。就拿我村青年团员来说吧，二十五个团员中就有十八个是文盲。在党的领导和政府的帮助下，我村成立了冬学，全村百分之七十的青年农民都上学了。许多老农民和干部也参加学习了。后来冬学又变为常年农民学校，直到现在，每天都有四十多人参加学习。最好的学员已认到三千多字，最差的也识有五百字。副村长张春从前连自己的名字也写不好，现在他已能看人民日报上的一般新闻了。因此，我村的冬学被选为全市模范冬学之一。
    我们不光领导农民进行土地改革，上冬学，我们还领导农民努力增加生产，抗美援朝。今年，我们全村订了增产半成至一成的爱国增产计划。原计划每亩地上三车肥料，现在已达每亩三车半了。今春天旱少雨，我们又及时号召群众早种早收。在“五一”节前三天，全村百分之九十以上的地都下了种。现在苗子都长得很高了，多数都耪了二遍，都抓了圊。今后我们更要努力争取多打粮食，捐献飞机大炮，支援人民志愿军，争取早日打垮美帝国主义。
    为了巩固人民民主专政，不久前我村召开了人民代表会议，讨论了全村的生产工作，订立了爱国公约，选举了村政权的干部，大伙选上我当村长。
    我知道，这些成绩都是党和毛主席领导我们得来的。没有毛主席，没有共产党，我们不能有现在这样的好光景。我们全村农民，坚决跟着毛主席、跟着共产党走，搞好工作，多打粮食，支援前线，打垮美帝国主义，建设新中国的新农村，并向苏联学习，将来建立集体农场，用机器耕田，过苏联农民那样美满的生活。
