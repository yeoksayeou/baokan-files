　　Shanghai Workers Engage in Intense Labor
　　Guarantee Early Completion of Production Tasks
　　Workers in Shanghai are welcoming "July 1st" by guaranteeing early completion of production tasks. The Chinese Communist Party branch of the Shanghai French Tram, Electricity, and Water Company was established during the second armed uprising of Shanghai workers in 1927. For more than twenty years thereafter, the branch led the worker masses in persistent struggle until the liberation of Shanghai. Recently, the company's workers are engaging in intense labor with extraordinary joy, guaranteeing the complete overhaul of the company's power supply lines before "July 1st." The inspection work has now been fully completed, preventing nearly 800 accidents of various sizes. The repair project is also half completed, with work efficiency increased by 200 percent. In addition to striving to complete the assembly of seven new-style buses by the end of June, all workers at the Shanghai Public Transportation Company's repair factory will produce three additional new cars as a gift for "July 1st." The chassis and engines of these new cars are all converted from waste materials by the workers. Copper workers Shi Xiangyao and Xu Huigen, etc., found scattered parts in the waste pile and assembled a broaching machine, increasing the efficiency of manufacturing "car iron window frames" from two chi long in thirty minutes to twelve chi long in one and a half minutes. Construction worker Meng Qingrui, fitter Wang Quanlin, and others collectively created a roller bed and press mold, and used two machine tools simultaneously, increasing the efficiency of manufacturing crossbars tenfold. The team of Wang Shusheng, a labor model from the Shanghai Inspection Section of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, guaranteed the completion of June's production tasks six days ahead of schedule and repaired two passenger car generators. Under the leadership of this team, all workers in the section guaranteed the repair of two more locomotives before "July 1st." Under the leadership of labor models Ruan Kaili and Gu A'bao, all workers at the Shanghai Steel Company's Second Factory guaranteed the completion of all of June's steel rolling tasks by the morning of June 25th, and strived to exceed the original task by 20 percent before "July 1st."

Liu Dezhen, a national labor model responsible for the steam turbine overhaul at the plant, is determined to complete the entire overhaul project of a certain generator before "July 1st" to celebrate the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the 21st, the two iron-smelting furnaces at the Shijingshan Steel Plant have continuously broken the daily production tasks assigned by the state, exceeding the quota by 10 percent for one and 14 percent for the other. Many new records have also emerged in other departments of the plant, such as the turnover rate of the transportation department, which has increased from 1.6 when reporting good news to the Government Administration Council in the spring to 2.036, and the Yang Jingqi team in the casting department's second shift, which created a record of ninety-nine days without a single defective product. The coal mining rate of the Chengzi Mine in the Mentougou Coal Mine has increased from four tons per worker to seven tons three, the Datai Mine has increased from eight tons per worker to twelve tons nine, and the No. 3 shaft of Xiaoheishan has completed the state's production tasks for the first half of 1951 twenty-one days ahead of schedule, producing an additional 258 tons of coal. The employees of the Beijing People's Printing Factory, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Beijing Machine Factory, the Qinghe Woolen Mill, and other factories are also actively revising patriotic covenants, using the practical actions of increasing production donations to welcome "July 1st." The employees on the car routes of the Beijing Tram Company are now actively preparing for 50,000 kilometers of safe driving. This safe driving movement will begin on "July 1st." The six female drivers trained by the company will also officially assume their duties on "July 1st."

　　Shenyang City Factory Workers Welcome July 1st
　　Conduct Major Product Quality Inspection Work
　　In order to welcome the 30th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, workers in various factories in Shenyang have actively launched a major product quality inspection work. Workers at the Shenyang Sack Factory, with production teams as units, discussed the significance of this quality inspection and the factory's current product quality issues. The trade union is also preparing to sign a collective contract with the administrative side before "July 1st." The woolen mill held a cadre meeting on the 18th to study the report of Minister Wang Heshou of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, and the factory director also gave a report. After two days of study, the groups will begin discussions to expose quality shortcomings. Technicians have begun to go deep into the workshops to set quality standards for new products. Trade union cadres are also cooperating with technicians to go deep into the workshops, understand the workers' thoughts, and carry out education. The workers' morale is very high, and the quality has improved. For example, in the weaving workshop of the factory, second and third-class products used to account for about 30 percent of all finished products. Now, third-class products have been eliminated, and second-class products have also decreased, with most of them being first-class products. The textile factory is currently conducting quality education. The quality exhibition began on the 18th. The chemical plant, dye factory, paint factory, and electrical factory are all conducting quality inspection education. The electrical engineering factories three and five have also held quality exhibitions. The bedding factory one is preparing a waste product exhibition, which will begin on June 2nd. In late June, it will begin to expose various problems existing in product quality.
