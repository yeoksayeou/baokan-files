　　Gifts from the People of the Motherland
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Ming

　　The gifts brought to Korea by the慰问团 (comfort mission) are from everyone who appreciates today's happiness, sent from the distant western border to the southeastern coast of the motherland, from the sacred national gate of the Yalu River to Zhennanguan, from every peaceful city and village, the most considerate things they could offer.

　　"A comfort bag contains a heart, and a heart contains a comfort letter, hundreds of millions of hardworking and brave people sending you hundreds of millions of hardworking and brave hearts." These are the lines of the poet Ke Zhongping. His red poetry book flew across the front lines with the comfort bags. Among the thousands of comfort bags embroidered with flowers and inscriptions, one was made by Sun Yu, a family member of a martyr in Lanzhou. She spent two days embroidering the seven characters "祝你们百战百胜！(Wishing you a hundred victories in a hundred battles!)" on the comfort bag stitch by stitch. She also donated 50,000 yuan of her savings from work. She said, "I want to do my best to support this war for all of us!"

　　Among the thousands of comfort bags, there were donations from the Uyghur people of Huocheng, Xinjiang, breakfast fees saved by the Young Pioneers of Hanyang, 140,000 Chairman Mao badges most loved by the soldiers, tens of thousands of books, picture books, pens, pencils, and diaries, various canned foods and vitamin pills, cod liver oil, and needles and thread so carefully and thoughtfully sent to the soldiers for mending clothes. ...

　　We can also see such gifts: a red silk banner more than two zhang long signed by 4,000 workers from a factory in Chongqing, with the words "You fight bravely at the front, we work diligently in the rear!" written in the center. Li Genyuan, a 73-year-old man and specially invited representative of the People's Political Consultative Conference, personally inscribed six poems on a piece of white silk, praising "How magnificent are the volunteers, with the spirit to fight tigers!"

　　We can also see: musk and deer antlers, specialties from the people of Qinghai, precious bear bile from the Tibetan people, butter from the Mongolian people, as well as white fungus and fritillary from Sichuan, dried beef and beef floss from Shaanxi and Gansu, famous Yunnan products such as Baiyao and Pu'er tea, Cantonese specialties such as sausage and preserved duck, porcelain statues of General Kim Il-sung specially made by Jingdezhen porcelain workers in Jiangxi, Xiang embroidery exquisitely embroidered with peace doves from Hunan, Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea, Jinhua ham, Shanghai's underwear and raincoats, North China's leather bags and medicines, Northeast's specially brewed grape wine and chocolate candy....

　　Volunteer soldiers cherish a cigarette given by the motherland, saying they will save it for when they are fighting; they cherish a commemorative badge, saying it is a symbol of the motherland's honor. But what they are particularly concerned about is the motherland's movement to resist America and aid Korea, to build a strong national defense and economic power. They say: We will hold the enemy at the front and let the motherland build itself beautifully!

　　Zhao Guoyou, a nationally renowned labor hero, brought this gift, which the soldiers were most concerned about, to the front. He reported that the Ma Hengchang team, an outstanding banner of the working class in the patriotic production competition, had completed four months of production tasks 22 days and 7 hours ahead of schedule; reported that the Xinzhungzi mine of the Huainan Coal Mine, encouraged by the victory in the counterattack in the Hengcheng area on the Korean front line, had created five coal mining records in the mine in eight days from February 17th to 25th, and created a new national record of 215.12 tons, only less than 12 tons away from the Soviet Stakhanov's second record of 227 tons. These remarkable production achievements aroused the most enthusiastic cheers from the vast number of soldiers. One volunteer soldier jumped up and shook Zhao Guoyou's hand tightly, saying, "Let's have a competition, you 'contract production' in the motherland, and we 'contract fighting' at the front, and we will not return home until we eliminate the American devils!"

　　The heroic deeds of a mother who contributed her child to the movement to increase production in the fight against America and aid Korea were respectfully spread at the front. Zhong Mengyue, the female worker group leader of a clothing factory in Hankou, entrusted her only son, who was seriously ill, to her sister's house in order to make forty sets of military uniforms overnight; when she returned home the next morning, her child had already died. This great mother wiped away her tears and said, "The child is my darling, but in order for forty soldiers at the front to not be cold, I am worthy of my child!" The Chinese and Korean People's fighters at the front were deeply moved by Zhong Mengyue's great love. Li Qingyu, a propaganda officer of the Korean People's Army, wrote in a letter of thanks: "The Chinese mother sacrificed her child for us, please treat us as your children, in order to eliminate our common enemy, we must be your good sons!"

　　The vigorous land reform movement being carried out in the vast rural areas of the country with a population of 128 million is great good news for the volunteer soldiers, the vast majority of whom are from peasant backgrounds. The soldiers listened with great concern to the farmers' representatives in the慰问团 (comfort mission) reporting on the specific situation of land reform in their hometowns, and many took careful notes to convey it to the comrades who had not heard it. The representatives reported on the preferential treatment enjoyed by the families of soldiers in cities and villages. The farmers' representatives also conveyed the oath of the emancipated peasants: "We must grow more grain and strongly support you!" The soldiers cheered to the representatives and asked them to bring their wishes back to the motherland: "We must kill more devils and wholeheartedly defend you!"

　　The slogan "Everyone resists America and aids Korea" is also resonating throughout the borderlands of the motherland. A 66-year-old Uyghur woman, Ayixihan, in Xinjiang Province hated the brutal atrocities of American imperialism and requested permission to go to the front to wash clothes for the soldiers. When the Uyghur representative Zakelov conveyed Ayixihan's wishes on the battlefield, the volunteer soldiers hugged him and shed tears of emotion. One soldier said at the time: "We want to thank the people of Xinjiang, the Uyghur people, we want to thank our motherland and Chairman Mao, so that we can embrace each other today, on the battlefield!"

　　Through these gifts, every soldier on the front sees that the people of the motherland are standing behind them; the people are uniting more closely; the people's strength is becoming more and more powerful in the struggle.

　　The gifts have not yet been sent. Before the慰问团 (comfort mission) went to Korea, the people of the whole country asked the representatives to say to the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people: "Whatever you need, we will support you with!" The Chinese people, who are resolutely resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending their homes and the country, will send a large number of planes, cannons, tanks..., continuously to the front.

### 祖国人民的礼物

　　祖国人民的礼物
    新华社记者　刘鸣
    慰问团带赴朝鲜的慰劳品是每一个觉察到今天的幸福的人，从遥远的祖国西部边疆到东南海岸，从神圣的国门鸭绿江到镇南关，从每一个和平城市与农村所送去的自己最体贴的东西。
    “一个慰问袋里装着一颗心，一颗心又装进一封慰问信，几万万勤劳勇敢的人民，给你们送来几万万勤劳勇敢的心。”这是诗人柯仲平的诗句。他的红色的诗册随着慰问袋飞遍前线。在成千上万个绣着花、题着字的慰问袋中，有一个是兰州的烈士家属孙瑜做的。她费了两天功夫一针针一线线地在慰问袋上绣着“祝你们百战百胜！”七个字。她又献出了自己做活积蓄下来的五万元钱。她说：“我要尽我的力量来支援这个为了我们大家的战争！”
    在成千上万个慰问袋里，装着新疆霍城维吾尔族人民的献金，装着汉阳少年儿童队员们节约下来的早餐费，装着十四万枚最为战士们喜爱的毛主席像纪念章，装着上万的书籍画报、钢笔、铅笔与日记本，装着各种食品罐头与维他命丸、鱼肝油，装着那样细心体贴地送给战士们缝补衣服用的针与线。……
    我们也可以看到这样的礼物：重庆某工厂四千工人的两丈多长的签着名的红绸，红绸正中写着：“你们在前方安心打，我们在后方老实干！”七十三岁老人、人民政协特邀代表李根源在一幅白绫上亲笔题诗六首，歌颂“壮哉志愿军，打虎好精神！”
    我们还可以看到：青海人民送的特产麝香与鹿茸，藏族人民送的珍品熊胆，蒙族人民送的黄油，以及四川的银耳与贝母，陕西、甘肃等地的牛肉干与牛肉松，云南的名产白药和普洱茶，广东的特产香肠与腊鸭，江西景德镇瓷工特制的金日成将军瓷像，湖南绣工精绣着和平鸽子的湘绣，杭州名产龙井茶，金华的火腿，上海的内衣、雨衣，华北的皮包与药品，东北特酿的葡萄美酒和巧格力糖……。
    志愿军战士珍视祖国赠送的一枝烟，他们说要留到打仗的时候吸；珍视一枚纪念章，他们说这是祖国荣誉的象征。但是他们特别关切的还是祖国的抗美援朝运动、建设强大国防力量和经济力量的生产运动。他们说：我们在前方扭住敌人，让祖国建设得美美的吧！
    全国著名的劳动英雄赵国有就把这种战士们最为关切的礼物带到了前方。他报告了工人阶级在爱国主义生产竞赛中的杰出旗帜——马恒昌小组提前二十二天零七小时完成了四个月的生产任务；报告了淮南煤矿新庄子矿在朝鲜前线横城地区反击战的胜利鼓舞下，二月十七日到二十五日的八天中，创造了五次该矿风镐采煤纪录，并创造了二一五·一二吨的全国新纪录，与苏联斯塔哈诺夫第二次所创二二七吨的纪录仅差不足十二吨。这些卓越的生产成绩激起了广大战士最热情的欢呼。有一位志愿军战士跳起身来紧握着赵国有的手说：“咱们来比赛吧，你们在祖国‘包生产’，我们在前方‘包打仗’，不消灭美国鬼子不回国！”
    一位因抗美援朝增产运动而贡献出了自己孩子的母亲的英雄事迹在前线被崇敬地传诵着。汉口某被服工厂女工组长钟梦月，为了连夜赶制四十套军衣，把自己生着重病的唯一的儿子寄托在姊姊家里；到第二天早晨她回家时，孩子已经病死了。这位伟大的母亲擦着眼泪说：“孩子是我的心头肉，但是为了前方四十个战士能不受冻，我是对得起自己孩子的！”前线上的中朝人民战士们被钟梦月的伟大的爱深深地感动了。一位朝鲜人民军宣传员李清玉在感谢信上写着：“中国的妈妈为了我们牺牲了自己的孩子，请把我们当作你的孩子吧，为了消灭我们共同的敌人，我们一定做你的好儿子！”
    在全国一亿二千八百万人口的广大农村中进行的热火朝天的土地改革运动，对于志愿军中数量极大的农民出身的战士是一个天大的喜讯。战士们用极大的关心来听取慰问团中的农民代表报告家乡土地改革的具体情况，很多人都仔细地记了笔记，好回去给没有听到的战友传达。代表们报告了军人家属在城市和农村中享有优待的情形。农民代表又传达了翻身农民的誓言：“我们一定多打粮食，大力支援你们！”战士们都向代表们欢呼并要他们把自己的心意带回祖国：“我们一定多杀鬼子，一心保卫你们！”
    “人人都来抗美援朝”这一口号，在祖国边陲也普遍地震响着。新疆省一位六十六岁的维吾尔族老太太阿依希罕痛恨美帝国主义的残暴兽行，要求允许她到前线去给战士洗衣服。当维族代表扎克洛夫在战地传达了阿依希罕的心意时，志愿军战士们拥抱着他感动得流泪了。一个战士当时说：“我们要感谢新疆人民、维族人民，要感谢我们的祖国与毛主席，使我们能在今天、在战场上拥抱在一起！”
    通过这些礼物，前线上的每一个战士都看到：祖国人民都站在他们后面；人民团结得越紧了；人民的力量在斗争中越来越雄厚了。
    礼物还没有送完。当慰问团赴朝之前，全国人民要代表们对中国人民志愿军、朝鲜人民军和朝鲜人民说：“你们需要什么，我们就支援什么！”坚决抗美援朝保家卫国的中国人民将把大量的飞机、大炮、坦克……，源源送上前线。
