　　Soldiers Welcome the Radio
    ——An Introduction to the Radio Listening Work of the Central-South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army
　　Yao Han
    Radio broadcasting has become a powerful tool for patriotic education and propaganda mobilization in the Central-South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army.

    Leaders of many units often take the time to guide this work. Some units have recently convened radio operators' meetings to summarize their work, exchange experiences, and further advance radio work in the troops.

    Many radio operators have shown great enthusiasm and initiative in their work. For example, Cheng Tianbao, a radio operator from a certain unit of the Liuzhou Sub-district, went up the mountains with the troops to suppress bandits. The mountain roads were narrow and difficult to navigate, and many pack horses fell into the ravines or rivers during the march. He sewed a pocket, put the radio in it, and carried it on his back. During troop rest periods, he would set up the antenna to listen to programs that the soldiers liked; or he would copy down news and report it to everyone, solving the difficulty of not being able to see newspapers in time. The same was true during troop training; radio operators often carried radios from one company to another, allowing soldiers to listen to news and programs from Beijing.

    Because of the timely reception of news through the radio, the blackboards in each company were more lively than before. They contained concise and popular writings about the victory news of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, as well as the construction situations in the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries. In some remote garrisons where troops could only see newspapers very late, the radio work played an especially important role. Radio operators compiled recorded news into mimeographed newsletters and sent them to commanders and fighters. This rapid radio work enabled troops to understand the political dynamics at home and abroad in any situation, and at the same time played a great role in propaganda and education among the masses. These recorded news and mimeographed newsletters could be quickly sent to the people, governments, and schools in villages and towns near the garrison. Some troops also frequently used the opportunity of market days to conduct street broadcasts. According to incomplete statistics from a certain unit in the Yulin Sub-district, more than 7,000 people participated in listening to several street broadcasts.

    The radio is universally welcomed by commanders and fighters; wherever it goes, it is surrounded by a group of soldiers. They call the radio "the listening device of a thousand miles." Many radio operators have said: "The soldiers love to listen to Beijing's broadcasts; they are deeply concerned about Chairman Mao and everything in the motherland, and they ask me to notify them early if Chairman Mao is going to give a broadcast speech one day." In February of this year, when the Second Company of a certain unit was listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the courtyard was already crowded half an hour beforehand; some companies even sent representatives to listen from miles away.

    After listening to the highly patriotic and heroic deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers, many soldiers were greatly encouraged, and they often expressed their determination in front of the radio to learn from the example of the Volunteers, and resolutely strike at American imperialism with practical actions to eliminate the remaining bandits and defend the national defense.

　　战士们欢迎收音机
    ——中南军区和四野广播收听工作介绍
　　姚汉
    广播收音机已成为中南军区和第四野战军各部队进行爱国主义教育和宣传鼓动的有力工具之一。
    很多部队的首长，经常抽空指导这一工作；有的单位还在最近专门召开了收音员会议，总结了工作，交流了经验，把部队收音工作更向前推进了一步。
    很多收音员在工作中表现了高度的热情和积极性。如柳州分区某部的收音员程天保，随着部队一起上山剿匪。山路狭小难行，许多驮马在行军中跌下山沟，或者摔倒在小河里。他就缝制了一个口袋，把收音机装在里面，自己背着走。部队休息的时候，他便架起天线，收听为战士们所喜爱的节目；或抄收记录新闻向大家报告，解决了部队中不能及时看到报纸的困难。在队伍整训中也是这样；收音员们经常背着收音机从这个连队走到那个连队，让战士们听北京的广播消息和节目。
    因为有了收音机及时收听消息，每一个连队的黑板报，比以前更有生气了。那上面简明而又通俗地写着关于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的胜利消息，以及苏联和各新民主主义国家的建设情形等。在某些驻地僻远，很晚才能看到报纸的部队，收音工作更显出了特别重要的作用。收音员把记录新闻编写成油印小报，传送给指战员们。这种快速的收音工作，使部队能在任何情况下了解国内外的政治动态，同时在群众中也起了很大的宣传教育作用。因为这些记录新闻和油印小报能同样迅速地传送给驻地附近的村乡人民、政府和学校。有些部队还经常利用赶集的机会，进行街头广播。据郁林分区某部不完全统计，在几次街头广播中，就有七千余人参加收听。
    收音机受到了指战员的普遍欢迎；它到那里，那里便围上了一群战士。他们把收音机称做“千里听”。不少收音员曾经这样说：“战士们都爱听北京的广播；他们一心想念着毛主席，和祖国的一切情况，并且要求我，如果有一天，毛主席要广播演讲，可得早些通知他们。”今年二月，某部二连在收听周恩来总理关于中苏友好同盟互助条约签订一周年的演讲词时，事前半小时院子里便挤满了人；有的连队并且派代表从几里路以外赶来收听。
    很多战士在收听了关于中国人民志愿军所表现的高度爱国主义精神与英雄主义的事迹后，受到莫大的鼓舞，他们常常就在收音机前面表示决心，要学习志愿军的榜样，坚决以肃清残余散匪和守卫国防的实际行动来打击美帝国主义。
