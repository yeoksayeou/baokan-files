　　Decision on Handling Letters from the People and Receiving the People

　　People's governments at all levels are the governments of the people themselves, and the staff of people's governments at all levels are the servants of the people. People's governments at all levels should closely connect with the masses of the people, wholeheartedly serve the people, and should encourage the masses of the people to supervise their own governments and staff. Therefore, people's governments at all levels should warmly receive and be responsible for handling letters from the people or requests for meetings and talks. In the past, some places attached great importance to this work, conscientiously and responsibly handled the problems raised by the people, met the demands of the people, and won the praise of the masses of the people. However, there are also many places where this work is not given enough attention, and some even adopt a perfunctory or careless and procrastinating attitude, which causes dissatisfaction among the masses of the people and alienates the relationship between the people's government and the masses of the people. This incorrect ideology and style of work must be strictly corrected. To this end, the following decision is made, requiring people's governments at all levels to earnestly implement it:

　　(1) People's governments at all levels above the county (city) level must instruct certain departments to designate full-time personnel within the original establishment to be responsible for handling letters from the masses of the people, and to establish inquiry offices or reception rooms to receive the masses of the people; leaders should also regularly conduct inspections and guidance.

　　(2) Opinions and problems raised by the people that can be handled by the agency itself must be handled in a timely manner. Those that need to be transferred to lower-level agencies or other relevant departments should be transferred in a timely manner, and inspections and follow-ups should be carried out. If they are handled by higher-level agencies, they should be handled in a timely manner, and the results should be reported back after handling; if there are special circumstances that cannot be handled in a timely manner, the letter writer and the original transferring agency should also be informed. However, questions with provocative or tentative intent raised by reactionary elements in the name of the people should not be answered.

　　The results of the handling of the problems raised by the people should be notified to the person concerned in a timely manner. For typical events with educational significance, they can be published in local newspapers or announced at appropriate meetings after handling.

　　(3) All cases of accusations against agencies or staff shall be handled by the people's supervisory organs. It is strictly forbidden for the accused agencies or personnel to take retaliatory actions; those who retaliate shall be punished, and those whose circumstances are serious shall be sent to the judicial organs for punishment according to law.

　　(4) All relevant agencies or staff must seriously study and deal with criticisms or opinions of the masses of the people published in newspapers and periodicals, and should make public replies or self-criticisms in the said newspapers and periodicals.

　　(5) For the work of handling letters from the people and receiving the people, a system of registration, research, transfer, inspection, follow-up, archiving, etc. should be established, and regular summaries should be made.

　　(6) People's governments and government departments at all levels should regularly check and summarize the work of handling letters from the people and receiving the people, and report to higher levels on a regular basis. The people's governments (military and political committees) of major administrative regions and the people's governments of centrally-administered municipalities should submit a summary report on the handling of this work to the Government Administration Council every six months.

　　中央人民政府政务院命令
    兹将“中央人民政府政务院关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”公布之。
    此令。
                                                 总理  周恩来
                                            一九五一年六月七日
　　关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定
    各级人民政府是人民自己的政府，各级人民政府的工作人员是人民的勤务员。各级人民政府应该密切地联系人民群众，全心全意地为人民服务；并应鼓励人民群众监督自己的政府和工作人员。因此，各级人民政府对于人民的来信或要求见面谈话，均应热情接待，负责处理。过去有些地方，对于这一工作很重视，认真负责地处理了人民所提出的问题，满足了人民的要求，获得人民群众的称赞。但也有很多地方，对于这一工作不够重视，有的甚至采取了敷衍应付或马虎拖延的态度，因而引起人民群众不满，疏远了人民政府与人民群众之间的关系。这种不正确的思想作风，必须严格纠正。为此，特作如下决定，要求各级人民政府切实执行：
    （一）县（市）以上各级人民政府，均须责成一定部门，在原编制内指定专人，负责处理人民群众来信，并设立问事处或接待室，接见人民群众；领导人并应经常地进行检查和指导。
    （二）对人民所提出的意见和问题，凡本机关能办理的，必须及时办理。需要转交下级机关或其他有关部门办理的，应及时转送，并检查催办。如系上级机关交办者，应及时办理，并于办理后将结果回报；若有特殊情况不能及时处理，亦应告知来信本人及原交机关。但对于反动分子借人民名义向政府提出的带有挑拨性或试探性的问题，则不要答复。
    对于人民所提问题的处理结果，应及时通知本人。对于有教育意义的典型事件于处理后，可在当地报纸上发表或在适当的会议上宣布。
    （三）凡属控告机关或工作人员的事件，应交人民监察机关处理。严禁被控机关或人员采取报复行为；如有报复者，应予以处分，情节严重者并应送司法机关依法惩处。
    （四）对报纸刊物所载人民群众的批评或意见，各有关机关或工作人员须认真研究处理，并应在该报刊上作公开的答复或检讨。
    （五）对于处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，应建立登记、研究、转办、检查、催办、存档等各项制度，并定期总结。
    （六）各级人民政府及政府各部门对处理人民来信和接见人民的工作，应经常检查总结，定期向上级报告。各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）和中央直属省市人民政府，应每半年向政务院作一次关于处理此项工作的总结报告。
