Shanghai Hefeng Private Yarn Factory workers participated in the demonstration against American Imperialism's arming of Japan on March 4th. Afterwards, driven by a few active members, each group established patriotic pacts, and enthusiasm was high for a time. However, the union did not provide leadership to conduct in-depth propaganda and education, help the groups establish inspection systems, and provide regular supervision; therefore, the patriotic pacts of most union groups became empty words, and some workers even forgot about the patriotic pact altogether.

The factory union did not conduct good pre-education and propaganda, and many groups did not correctly understand the significance of establishing a patriotic pact. The patriotic pacts of many groups were not carefully deliberated and discussed; they were only written by the group leader, calling on workers or cadres with a higher cultural level to write a few articles, and everyone signed their names. Some groups only established pacts because they were embarrassed not to, after seeing other groups do so. Or it was a matter of "If other groups set ten articles, we will set twelve." Therefore, the contents of the patriotic pacts were all empty. Some groups, in order to quickly publish the patriotic pacts, did not even keep the original drafts, only writing them on banner paper and posting them on the walls. As time went on, the covenants were tattered, and everyone could not remember what the contents were. After the patriotic pacts were established, the union did not regularly inspect and supervise them. Some groups stopped after implementing them for two or three days; some groups did not implement them at all. For example, the patriotic pact of the steel wire room in Class B: "Guarantee to copy the steel wire large cylinder three times," but it was always copied twice. A common clause in each group's patriotic pact was: "Do not be late or leave early, ask for leave if something happens." However, the phenomenon of not following leave procedures is still quite serious. Although there were individual groups, such as the doffing group in the B class fine yarn room, who diligently implemented the patriotic pact, the union did not pay attention to cultivating them and allowed them to drift along.

At the end of March, the union planned to check the implementation of the patriotic pacts, but did not make specific arrangements. It was not until after "May Day" that the union called on each workshop to elect inspection cadres for the patriotic pacts. But when each workshop elected the inspection cadres for the patriotic pacts, the union became silent again. The elected inspection cadres did not know what work to do. Now the union is busy arranging the re-election of the union committee, and the inspection of patriotic pacts is no longer mentioned.

### 上海合丰纱厂工会放弃领导  爱国公约成纸上空文

　　上海合丰纱厂工会放弃领导
    爱国公约成纸上空文
    上海私营合丰纱厂工人在三月四日参加反对美帝国主义武装日本示威游行以后，经少数积极分子的推动，各小组纷纷订立爱国公约，一度热情很高。但工会没有加以领导进行深入的宣传教育，帮助小组建立检查制度，经常督促；因此，大部工会小组的爱国公约成为一纸空文，有些工友甚至把爱国公约这回事都忘掉了。
    该厂工会事先没有很好地宣传教育，许多小组都没有正确认识到订立爱国公约的意义。很多小组的爱国公约根本没有经过具体的酝酿和讨论，仅由小组长叫文化水平较高的工人或干部写上几条，每人签上一个名字便算了事。有些小组甚至是看到别的组订了，自己不好意思不订，才订了的。或者是“别组订十条，我们订十二条”。因此，爱国公约的内容都很空洞。有些小组为了赶紧把爱国公约公布出来，底稿都不存，只写在标语纸上，贴上了墙壁。日子一久，公约都已破碎不堪，大家也记不得内容是些什么了。爱国公约订立后，工会没有经常加以检查和督促，有些小组执行了两三天便停止了；有些小组根本没有执行，象乙班钢丝间的爱国公约：“保证抄钢丝大锡林抄三次”，但始终是抄两次。各组爱国公约普遍有一条：“不迟到早退，有事请假。”但是不履行请假手续的现象现在仍相当严重。虽然也有个别小组如乙班细纱间落纱小组，执行爱国公约很认真，但工会也没有注意培养，听其自流。
    三月底，工会曾打算检查爱国公约的执行情形，但是并没有具体地布置。直到“五一”以后，工会才号召各车间要选举爱国公约的检查干事。但当各车间选出了爱国公约检查干事后，工会又不声不响了。被选出的检查干事不知道该做些啥工作。现在工会正在忙着布置工会委员会的改选工作，检查爱国公约已不提了。
