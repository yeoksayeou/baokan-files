Shanxi Tunliu and Other Places Correct the "Take a Break" Mentality in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement

(I)
In Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, many cadres developed a "let's relax a bit" mentality towards carrying out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement after the "May 1st" International Labor Day. They thought: "May 1st is over, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement is basically done, time for a break." For example, the cadres of Mingshui Village said: "The May 1st holiday is over, the Resist America, Aid Korea has been resisted." Some village cadres said: "We were so busy before May 1st, now we can finally relax!" Even county cadre Yang Fusheng said this during a mass meeting in the West Gate of the city: "May 1st is over, everyone can relax and focus on production." This kind of thinking was prevalent among county, district, and village cadres. The main reason for this mentality is that some cadres did not understand that Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education is a regular task, that Resist America, Aid Korea is the direct political goal of all work, and the driving force for all work to move forward. Therefore, after the "May 1st" holiday passed, the thought of "relaxing a bit" and "taking a break" naturally arose. Whether this problem can be solved immediately will directly affect whether the Resist America, Aid Korea movement can be carried out in a deep and sustained manner, and will also affect whether the achievements of the previous stage of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement can be consolidated.

After discovering this problem, the Tunliu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately proposed solutions: (1) Each district should convene a cadre meeting to study relevant documents and establish the idea of continuing to implement the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in a deep and sustained manner. It is also necessary to conduct a focused inspection from cadres to the masses to overcome the complacency of cadres and the masses. (2) The cadres at the county level in each organization dispatched to the countryside to carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement should continue to work in their original base villages. (3) Establish and rectify regular propaganda organizations and tools, such as propaganda networks, teaching stations, farmers' spare time schools, blackboards, and loudspeakers. (4) On the basis of the masses' ideological awareness after the popularization stage, lead and mobilize the masses to formulate and check the implementation of patriotic pledges. The content of the pledges should emphasize the combination of Resist America, Aid Korea with practical work, so as to bring the masses' patriotic enthusiasm into various practical works. It is also necessary to promptly check the problems in the implementation of the patriotic pledges. (5) County and district leaders should generally summarize the experiences of the previous stage of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in order to guide the in-depth development of the movement.

(II)
In some villages in the Fifth District of Taiyuan City, the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic political education became somewhat lax after the "May 1st" holiday. District cadres focused on inspecting some villages and schools, and found that in some villages, the work was not as intense as before "May 1st," the urgent work was put down, and the tasks to be completed were postponed. For example, there was no one working in the Dongshe Village office, and the village correspondent locked the door and went to do his own private affairs. The district correspondent went to deliver a letter but could not find anyone to receive it after running twice. The village's blackboard newspaper had three issues before the "May 1st" holiday, but now there is only one, and it is still old content that has not been changed. Land certificates in Sange Village were filled out long ago, and it was said that they would be issued after the "May 1st" holiday, but they have not been issued yet. The cadres are all doing their own work, and they have not considered or planned how to deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education in the future. The women's literacy class in Chaimen Village now has fewer people attending, and one day there was no class. There are many things like this.

The investigation revealed that the main reason for this phenomenon is that some cadres regarded the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic education as only a "crash" task for a certain period of time, and did not see it as a long-term and regular movement that should be closely combined with practical work. Some people believe that "May 1st" was the climax of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and that after "May 1st," the task was completed and everything was fine. They did not consider guiding the masses to deepen and sustain this movement on the basis of popularizing Resist America, Aid Korea, anti-American and patriotic education. For example, the deputy head of Chaimen Village said: "The work of Resist America, Aid Korea before 'May 1st' was really tight enough, tired enough, let's take a break!" Cadres in Jiancheng Village believe that welcoming "May 1st" was a crash task; now that the movement is over, they should wait for other movements.

After discovering these problems, the district has promptly conducted criticism and education on these ideological problems, focusing on explaining to the responsible cadres of the villages that the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement is a lasting political task. They also compared the patriotic pledges made by each village and are beginning to reverse and solve some incorrect understandings and thoughts. From this inspection of the work and thoughts of village cadres, it can be seen that propagandists and district cadres also have insufficient understanding of these issues. The district is preparing to hold a meeting of propagandists and a meeting of all district cadres to clarify their thinking and systematically deploy future plans to deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in combination with various specific tasks.

### 山西屯留等地纠正  抗美援朝运动中的“歇一歇”思想

　　山西屯留等地纠正
    抗美援朝运动中的“歇一歇”思想
            （一）
    山西省屯留县许多干部在“五一”国际劳动节以后，对开展抗美援朝运动，产生了“松一口气”的思想。他们认为：“过了‘五一’节啦，抗美援朝就算过去啦，可该歇一歇了。”如鸣水村干部说：“五一节过了，抗美援朝已经抗过去了。”有的村干部说：“五一节前可把人忙坏了，这一下可该松一松哩！”甚至连县干部杨福生在城西关开群众会时也这样说：“过了‘五一’节了，大家就松口气，好好闹生产吧。”像这样的思想，在县、区村干部中普遍存在着。产生这种思想的主要原因是有些干部不懂得抗美援朝爱国教育是一个经常的工作，抗美援朝是一切工作的直接的政治目的；是一切工作前进的动力。所以他们在“五一”节过去以后，很自然地“松一口气”、“歇一歇”的思想就来了。这个问题能不能马上解决，将直接关系到抗美援朝运动能不能深入、持久开展，也关系着前一段抗美援朝运动的成果能不能巩固下去。
    中共屯留县委会发现这一问题后，立即提出了纠正的办法：（一）各区召开干部会议，学习有关文件，树立继续深入、持久贯彻抗美援朝运动的思想。并要从干部到群众进行一次有重点的检查，克服干部、群众的自满情绪。（二）县级各机关抽调下乡开展抗美援朝运动的干部，仍然坚持原来的基点村工作。（三）建立与整顿经常的宣传组织机构和工具，如宣传网、传授站、农民业余学校、黑板报、广播筒等。（四）在群众经过普及阶段的思想觉悟基础上，领导发动群众订立与检查执行爱国公约，公约的内容强调抗美援朝与实际工作结合，以便把群众爱国的热忱发挥到各种实际工作中去。并要及时检查贯彻爱国公约执行中的问题。（五）县、区领导上要普遍总结前段抗美援朝运动中的经验，借以指导运动的深入开展。（耕溪）
            （二）
    太原市五区部分村庄，过了“五一”节以后，抗美援朝爱国政治教育就有些松劲。区干部有重点地检查了一些村庄和学校，结果发现一些村庄，工作上不像“五一”以前那样紧张，当前急需要做的工作放下了，该完成的任务推后了。如东社村公所一个办公的人也没有，村通讯员也锁住门子干自己的私事去了。区上通讯员去送信，连跑两次找不到一个人收信。该村的黑板报“五一”节以前出三块，现在只有一块，还是没有换过的旧内容。三给村土地证早填好了，说是过了“五一”节往下发，可是现在还没有发。干部们都在干自己的活，抗美援朝爱国教育今后怎样深入，就没有考虑和计划。柴村妇女识字班，现在去的人也少啦，有一天就没上课，像这样的事情还很多。
    检查发生这种现象的原因，主要是有些干部把抗美援朝爱国主义教育认为只是一个时期的“突击”任务，没有把它看成一个长期的经常要与实际工作紧密结合的运动。有人认为“五一”是抗美援朝运动的顶点，过了“五一”就完成任务、万事大吉啦。没有考虑要在抗美援朝反美爱国教育普及的基础上，引导群众把这个运动走向深入与持久。如柴村村副说：“‘五一’前抗美援朝工作搞得真是够紧啦，够累啦，休息休息吧！”简城村干部认为迎接“五一”是突击性工作；现在运动过去了，就该等着搞别的运动。
    区里检查发现了这些问题后，已抓紧这些思想问题进行了批判教育，着重向村负责干部解释了抗美援朝爱国运动是持久的政治任务，并把各村所订的爱国公约作了对照，正在开始扭转和解决一些不正确认识和思想。从这次检查村干部的工作和思想中看，宣传员和区干部在这些问题上同样也认识不够，区里正准备召开宣传员会议和全区干部会议，澄清思想，有系统地布置今后的深入抗美援朝运动与各项具体工作相结合的计划。（陈萍）
