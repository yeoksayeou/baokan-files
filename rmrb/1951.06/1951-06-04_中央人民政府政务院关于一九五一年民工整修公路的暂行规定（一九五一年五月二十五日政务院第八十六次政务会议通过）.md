In order to fulfill the 1951 road construction plan, repair and maintain existing highways, promote urban-rural exchange, and take into account the current financial difficulties of the country, and under the condition of not delaying agricultural work, it is necessary to appropriately organize civilian labor in various places to repair highways. To this end, the "Provisional Regulations on Organizing Civilian Labor for Highway Repair" are hereby promulgated as follows:

	I.	The mobilization, organization, and leadership of civilian labor shall be the responsibility of the People's Governments at the special district, county, district, and township (village) levels; engineering technical guidance shall be the responsibility of the transportation departments at all levels.
	II.	The People's Governments at the special district, county, district, and township (village) levels should seriously organize and allocate the work of mobilizing civilian labor appropriately; and make all preparations before construction starts in order to cherish and avoid wasting manpower.
	III.	The People's Governments at the special district, county, district, and township (village) levels should carry out extensive and in-depth mobilization when mobilizing civilian labor, explaining the significance of highway repair; and should strengthen propaganda and education work during the construction period, carry out patriotic emulation, and promptly evaluate and reward achievements to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of civilian workers.
	IV.	The principle for civilian labor in highway repair is that each labor force should not bear more than ten standard workdays per year (the standard workday is based on the amount of work done by most people in the area each day). However, those who voluntarily participate or exchange labor are not subject to this limit.
	V.	In general areas, the principle is not to provide food subsidies to civilian workers participating in highway repair, but in special circumstances or when mobilizing civilian workers from more distant areas, the provincial People's Government may, according to local conditions, stipulate methods for appropriate subsidies, the expenses of which shall be paid from road construction funds or local transportation business expenses.
	VI.	Local People's Governments should prepare simple facilities for first aid and medical treatment at the construction site to take care of temporary illnesses or accidental injuries of civilian workers.
	VII.	The main tasks of civilian labor in highway repair are as follows:
		A.	Earthwork and simple stonework;
		B.	Ordinary work for bridge and culvert projects and other structures;
		C.	Ordinary work for drainage and waterproofing;
		D.	Extraction and transportation of road surface materials;
		E.	Highway afforestation.
		Civilian workers with technical skills should be assigned to corresponding work according to their skills.
	VIII.	Ordinary tools used for highway repair that are owned by ordinary civilian workers should be investigated and organized in advance, and should be brought to the construction site by the civilian workers as much as possible; special tools should be planned and supplied by the competent transportation departments.
	IX.	Before construction starts, the competent transportation departments should formulate a construction plan based on the types and quantities of projects, sections, construction methods, required number of workers, and completion deadlines, and submit it to the local special district or county People's Government.
	X.	Each special district or county People's Government shall, in accordance with the implementation rules for organizing civilian labor for highway repair issued by the People's Government (Military and Political Committee) of the Greater Administrative Area or the directly subordinate province (municipality) and the construction plan proposed by the competent transportation departments, combine with local conditions to formulate detailed construction methods, and submit them to the provincial People's Government for approval. After approval, the People's Governments at the special district, county, district, and township (village) levels shall be responsible for implementation.
	XI.	During the construction period, all relevant transportation departments must send technical cadres to cooperate with each other, supervise construction, and guide relevant technical matters.
	XII.	After completion, acceptance should be carried out immediately, workdays should be counted, a formal final account should be prepared, and experiences should be summarized and reported level by level.
	XIII.	The People's Governments (Military and Political Committees) of the Greater Administrative Areas and the People's Governments of the directly subordinate provinces (municipalities) should immediately formulate implementation rules for organizing civilian labor for highway repair in 1951 for their respective areas and provinces (municipalities) based on these regulations and in conjunction with local actual conditions, and report them to the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government for the record.
