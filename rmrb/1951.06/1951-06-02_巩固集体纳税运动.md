　　Consolidate the Collective Tax Payment Movement
    The collective tax payment movement is a patriotic action initiated by the industrial and commercial sectors at the present stage, on a voluntary and conscious basis. This patriotic movement will ensure the timely entry of national tax revenue into the treasury, strengthen national defense, and promote economic and cultural construction, which is very necessary.
    With the deepening of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the collective tax payment movement in the industrial and commercial sectors has become a regular system in some cities. The "savings tax payment" method is a good way to consolidate the collective tax payment movement. This method is being implemented and promoted in Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou, and other places. Wuhan, Chengdu, Tianjin, Yantai, and many small and medium-sized cities have launched competitions to pay taxes in advance during the collective tax payment movement. The industrial and commercial sectors in Yantai City specifically agreed to pay their first-half income tax on May 15th. In addition to patriotic pacts, industrial and commercial sectors in many cities have also established more specific tax payment pacts and formed tax payment mutual assistance groups. These are all good ways to consolidate the collective tax payment movement.
    At the same time, it must also be pointed out that some industrialists and businessmen still have dishonest bookkeeping and reporting practices, and there are instances of tax evasion. It is hoped that the tax authorities, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and progressive members of the industrial and commercial sectors will appropriately criticize and educate these business owners; and it is hoped that these people will consciously correct these errors. The collective tax payment movement should be promoted. It is hoped that the tax authorities and the Federation of Industry and Commerce in areas where this movement has already been launched will summarize their achievements and experiences, and, based on "accurate declaration, assessment according to rates, no evasion or arrears, and full collection," promote this patriotic tax payment movement more widely to all regions and industries.

　　巩固集体纳税运动
    集体纳税运动是现阶段工商界在自觉自愿的基础上，广泛展开的群众性的爱国行动。这一爱国运动，将可保证国家税收及时入库，加强国防、经济、文化的建设，是非常必要的。
    随着抗美援朝运动的深入，工商界的集体纳税运动，在有些城市已经成为经常制度了，“储蓄纳税”办法，就是巩固集体纳税运动的一种很好办法。这一办法在上海、北京、苏州等地都在开始实行与推广中。武汉、成都、天津、烟台及许多中小城镇，在集体纳税运动中，纷纷展开提前交纳税款竞赛。烟台市工商界并具体地约定在五月十五日交纳上半年所得税。很多城市的工商界，在爱国公约之外，又订立更具体的纳税公约，成立纳税互助小组。这都是巩固集体纳税运动的好办法。
    同时还须指出，在这一运动当中还有些工商业者记账、申报不够老实，还有偷漏税款的现象。希望税务机关、工商业联合会和进步的工商界人士，对这些工商户进行适当的批评与教育；并希望这些人自觉地改正这种错误。集体纳税运动是应该推广的，希望已开展这个运动的地区的税收机关、工商业联合会总结成绩和经验，在“正确申报，依率计征、不偷不欠、十足收齐”的基础上，把这一爱国纳税运动更普遍地推广到各地区、各行业中去。
