Xinhua News Agency, Wuhu, 2nd. The industrial and commercial circles of Tunxi City, Southern Anhui Province, recently challenged industrial and commercial circles in cities across the country to launch a long-term patriotic donation campaign. In their letter of challenge, they wrote: "In addition to actively completing various tasks, launching tax-paying competitions, and long-term subscriptions to magazines to comfort the Chinese and Korean fighters, we have also launched a long-term patriotic donation campaign. The city's industrial and commercial circles donate more than 12 million yuan every month until Taiwan is liberated and American imperialism is defeated. This amount is very small, but if the industrial and commercial circles of our country participate in this movement, then 'many grains of sand make a tower' and 'trickles form a stream', which will have a significant effect on supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in annihilating the enemy." Note: Since signing the patriotic pact last December, nearly a thousand industrial and commercial households in Tunxi City have launched a large-scale donation campaign of "one letter," "one bullet," and "one bag"; during the Spring Festival, they donated more than 116 million yuan to comfort the Chinese and Korean people's fighters.

    向城市工商界挑战  展开长期捐献运动
    【新华社芜湖二日电】皖南屯溪市工商界最近向全国各城市工商界提出展开长期爱国捐献运动的挑战。他们在挑战书上写道：“我们除了积极地完成各种任务，展开纳税竞赛和长期订赠杂志慰劳中朝战士外，我们又开展了长期的爱国捐献运动，全市工商界每月捐献一千二百多万元，直到解放台湾打垮美帝国主义为止。这个数目是很微少的，但假如我们全国的工商界都来参加这一运动，则“聚沙成塔”，“涓滴成流”，对支援中国人民志愿军与朝鲜人民军歼灭敌人，是有重大作用的。”按：屯溪市的近千户工商业者自去年十二月订立爱国公约后，即展开了大规模“一信”、“一弹”、“一袋”的捐献运动；过春节时他们曾捐献了一亿一千六百多万元慰劳中朝人民战士。
