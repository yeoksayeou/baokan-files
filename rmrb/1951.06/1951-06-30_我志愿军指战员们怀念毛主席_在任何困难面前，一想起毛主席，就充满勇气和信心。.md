Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th: The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army constantly remember the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in battle. In the face of any hardship or difficulty, as long as they think of Chairman Mao, they are filled with courage and confidence.

　　During the days and nights of fighting on both sides of the Han River, the Second Platoon of the Fourth Company of a certain unit, under the command of Deputy Company Commander Lin Tingbiao, guarded Height 399 on the north bank of the Han River. They repelled four assaults by superior enemies. At the most tense moment of the battle, Deputy Company Commander Lin solemnly called on his comrades: "Communists, dear comrades! We must hold our ground and kill more enemies in order to be worthy of the title of Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Fight this battle well, so that Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country know our deeds. This is our greatest glory!" His comrades shouted in unison: "Hold the position, kill the enemy! Add glory to Chairman Mao!" The brave men fulfilled their vows: killing and wounding more than two hundred enemies.

　　While marching, the song "Following Mao Zedong, forever towards victory, forever towards brightness!" made the soldiers forget their fatigue. When climbing steep mountains, in the bitter cold of minus forty degrees, when food supplies could not reach the front lines and they were eating frozen potatoes, the soldiers never bowed their heads in the face of these difficulties, because they remembered Chairman Mao's famous saying: overcoming difficulties is victory.

　　Even in the front-line fortifications, when holding class meetings or group meetings, the soldiers always tried to hang a picture of Chairman Mao. The comfort group of people from the motherland who came to the Korean front to express their regards once presented a batch of badges with Chairman Mao's image to heroes, models, and meritorious people. Commanders and fighters who did not receive the badges were determined to make plans to perform meritorious service in battle and strive to wear the glorious badge. The soldiers said: "Although we are far away from Chairman Mao in Korea, our hearts are always closely following Chairman Mao!" Last winter, in the battle to defend Height 1081 near Dongshan in Hamgyongnam-do, after a soldier sacrificed himself, he was still holding a picture of Chairman Mao tightly in his hand. This great soldier, when dedicating his precious life to fulfilling the entrustment of the people of the motherland, did not forget to bid a final farewell to his beloved leader.

　　The Volunteer Army used its actions of cherishing the Korean people to specifically introduce the greatness of their leader to the Korean people. They did not move a single needle or thread of the Korean people, cherished every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea, and tried their best to help the people with their work during the intervals between battles and work. When the Korean people asked the Volunteer Army soldiers why they were so disciplined, the soldiers said to the Korean people: "This is because we are good students of Chairman Mao." Whenever Korean children held the hands of Volunteer Army soldiers and asked the Volunteer Army uncles to sing a Chinese song, the soldiers almost without exception sang "The East is Red" and "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China" for them. In Korea, in every village where the Volunteer Army had lived or passed through, most of the children could sing these two songs.

　　If you were to ask the Volunteer Army soldiers what they hoped for most, many would answer you: "After defeating the American aggressors, I hope to wear the Korean Liberation Medal and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" Some said: "We hope that after returning to our country victoriously, Chairman Mao can stand on Tiananmen Square and review our ranks."

　　我志愿军指战员们怀念毛主席
    在任何困难面前，一想起毛主席，就充满勇气和信心。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】中国人民志愿军的指挥员和战斗员们，在战斗中时刻怀念着祖国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。在任何艰苦与困难面前，只要一想起了毛主席，他们就充满了勇气和信心。
    在汉江两岸的日日夜夜的战斗中，某部四连二排在副连长林廷标指挥下，守卫着汉江北岸三九九高地。他们打垮了优势敌人的四次冲锋。在战斗最紧张的关头，林副连长庄严地号召他的战友们：“共产党员们、亲爱的战友们！我们要守住阵地，杀伤更多的敌人，才对得起中国人民志愿军这一称号。打好这一仗，让毛主席和全国人民知道我们的事迹，这就是我们最大的光荣！”他的战友们一齐喊道：“守住阵地，杀伤敌人！为毛主席增光！”勇士们实现了自己的誓言：杀伤了二百多个敌人。
    在行军的时候，“……跟着毛泽东，永远向胜利，永远向光明！”的歌声，使战士们忘记了疲劳。在攀越陡峭的山岭时，在零下四十度的严寒里，在前线上粮食接济不上，吃着结成冰块了的马铃薯时，战士们从来不在这些困难面前低头，因为他们想起了毛主席的名言：克服困难，就是胜利。
    即使在最前线的工事里，当开班务会或者小组会的时候，战士们总要设法挂上一张毛主席像。来朝鲜前线慰问的祖国人民慰问团曾经把一批有毛主席像的纪念章赠给英雄、模范和功臣。没有得到纪念章的指挥员和战斗员们纷纷下决心，订计划，要在战斗中立功，争取戴上光荣的纪念章。战士们说：“我们在朝鲜离毛主席虽然很远，可是，我们的心永远是紧跟着毛主席的！”去年冬天，在咸镜南道东山附近坚守一零八一高地的战斗中，有一个战士牺牲了以后，手里还紧握着一张毛主席像。这一个伟大的战士，在为了完成祖国人民的付托而献出自己宝贵生命的时候，还不忘向自己敬爱的领袖作最后的告别。
    志愿军用自己的爱护朝鲜人民的行动，向朝鲜人民具体地介绍了自己领袖的伟大。他们不动朝鲜人民的一针一线，爱护朝鲜的一山一水、一草一木，并且在战斗和工作的空隙尽量帮助人民劳动。当朝鲜人民询问志愿军战士们为什么这样纪律严明时，战士们就对朝鲜人民说：“这是因为我们是毛主席的好学生”。每当朝鲜的孩子们拉着志愿军战士的手，要求志愿军叔叔唱个中国歌的时候，战士们几乎无例外地都是唱“东方红”和“没有共产党就没有中国”给他们听。在朝鲜，凡是有志愿军住过或经过的村庄，那里的孩子们大多数都会唱这两个歌了。
    如果要问志愿军战士们最希望的事情是什么？许多会回答你说：“等打垮了美国侵略军，希望能戴着朝鲜解放纪念章，到北京去见毛主席！”有的说：“我们希望在胜利回国后，毛主席能站在天安门上检阅我们的队伍”。
