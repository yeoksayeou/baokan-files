　　Intolerable that the Catholic 教务协进委员会 Sabotages the Chinese Catholic Independent Patriotic Movement
　　Zhang Chunqiao
　　In the great movement of Resist America, Aid Korea, patriotic Catholics, following the Christians, initiated the Three-Self (self-government, self-support, self-propagation) Reform Movement. This movement is in line with the interests of the Chinese people and is welcomed by people from all walks of life in China.
　　As this movement moves forward, the imperialist elements in the Catholic Church are doing their best to resist and sabotage this patriotic movement. In particular, the Shanghai Catholic 教务协进委员会, controlled by the imperialist element Liberi, is doing its best to carry out this sabotage activity, and it has reached an intolerable point.
　　I have scoured the 《传教丛书》 ("Missionary Series") and other publications recently published by the Catholic 教务协进委员会, and everywhere I see slander, intimidation, rumors, and incitement against the Chinese people, our great motherland, the People's Government, and the self-reliance and reform movement of patriotic Catholics.
　　Every Chinese person should love their motherland, and Chinese Catholics should also love their motherland. Today, the Chinese people love their motherland, not only because we ourselves grew up in China, our ancestors were in China, and our children and grandchildren will also live in China, but also because today's China is already the people's own country, and our motherland is already a top power in the world. As Chinese people, how can we not feel proud and honored by the strength of our motherland? However, how does the Catholic 教务协进委员会 view our great motherland and people? They do not promote love for the motherland, but curse the Chinese people to "unhesitatingly destroy in public the altar of that 'motherland' deity they have forged," (see "Missionary Samadhi," page 57), which they believe is "necessary to use all our energy to do the work of 'uprooting the source'." (Ibid., page 56) What a blatant and ugly face of imperialist elements!
　　Recently, the 《传教丛书》 ("Missionary Series") published by the Catholic 教务协进委员会 has successively published reactionary documents such as "The Necessary Understanding of Catholic-Christian Issues," "The Catholic Church's View on the Self-Support, Self-Propagation, and Self-Government Movement," "On the Legal Status of the Church Stipulated by the Catholic Code," "Letter to Catholic Believers in the Distance," etc., which sabotage the Catholic self-reliance and reform movement. The exposed secret document "Learning Reference" was also printed by the association. In addition, the association also published Chen Zhemin's anti-self-reliance and reform movement booklet "Holy and Catholic Church" and comic strips such as "Martyr Wang Yana," which slandered the Chinese people's anti-imperialist patriotic movement. In all these books and periodicals, they spread the smoke screen that Catholicism is "transnational," "trans-class," "trans-political," and "trans-regime" to cover up the use of religion by imperialism to invade our country and to defend the Vatican, the tool of American imperialism. According to this small group of imperialist elements and their lackeys, the Chinese people cannot run their own religious affairs, and the administrative, economic, and missionary rights of the Chinese Church must be controlled by imperialist elements and foreign missionaries. Obviously, this is not just a matter of a reactionary organization publishing a few reactionary books and periodicals, but a crime of imperialist elements in this reactionary organization interfering in China's internal affairs in a planned way, and a crime of sabotaging the Catholic self-reliance and reform movement.
　　In the great movement of Resist America, Aid Korea, this small group of reactionary elements dared to be enemies of the Chinese people and vainly attempt to continue to do evil, which is intolerable to every patriotic Chinese person, and even more intolerable to every patriotic Catholic. Patriotic and anti-imperialist Catholic believers and priests across the country should unite! Eliminate the imperialists and their running dogs!

### 不能容忍天主教教务协进委员会破坏中国天主教自立爱国运动

　　不能容忍天主教教务协进委员会破坏中国天主教自立爱国运动
　　张春桥
    在我国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动中，爱国的天主教徒，继基督教徒之后，发起了自传、自养、自治的三自革新运动。这个运动是符合于中国人民利益的，是为中国各界人民所欢迎的。
    当这个运动向前发展的时候，天主教中的帝国主义分子，正以全力来反抗和破坏这个爱国运动。特别是为帝国主义分子黎培里所控制的上海天主教教务协进委员会正以全力进行这种破坏活动，并且已经到了令人不能容忍的地步。
    我翻遍了天主教教务协进委员会在最近出版的《传教丛书》及其他出版物，到处是对中国人民、对我们伟大祖国、对人民政府、对爱国天主教徒的自立革新运动的诬蔑、威吓、造谣和挑拨离间。
    每一个中国人都应当爱祖国，中国天主教徒也应当爱祖国。今天，中国人民爱祖国，不但因为我们自己生长在中国，我们的祖先在中国，我们的子子孙孙也将居住在中国，更因为今天的中国已经是人民自己的国家，我们的祖国已经是世界上的头等强国。凡是中国人民，对于祖国的强大能够不感到骄傲和荣耀吗？但是，天主教教务协进委员会怎样看我们伟大的祖国和人民呢？他们不是宣传爱祖国，而是咀咒着要中国人民“把他们所伪造的那‘祖国’大神的祭坛，毫不迟疑的当众拆毁，”（见“传教三昧”第五十七页），这就是他们认为“必须用全副的精力，去做那‘拔本塞源’的工作。”（同上，第五十六页）这是多么露骨的帝国主义分子的丑恶面孔！
    最近这一时期，天主教教务协进委员会出版的《传教丛书》连续发表了“关于天主教基督教问题应有的认识”、“天主教对于自养自传自治运动的观点”、“关于天主教法典规定教会的法律地位”、“给远处公教信友的信”等等破坏天主教自立革新运动的反动文件。已被揭发的秘密文件“学习参考”，也是该会刊印的，此外，该会并出版了陈哲敏所作反自立革新运动的“圣而公教会”小册子和诬蔑中国人民反帝爱国运动的“英烈王亚纳”等连环画。他们在所有这些书刊中散布天主教是“超国籍”、“超阶级”、“超政治”、“超政权”的烟幕，来为帝国主义利用宗教侵略我国作掩护，来为美帝国主义的工具梵蒂冈作辩护。照这一小撮帝国主义分子和他们的走卒的话来说，中国人不能办自己的宗教事业，中国教会的行政权、经济权和传教权，必须操在帝国主义分子和外国传教士的手里。显然地，这不仅仅是某一个反动机构出版了几本反动书刊的事，而是这一个反动机构中的帝国主义分子有计划地干涉中国内政的罪行，破坏天主教自立革新运动的罪行。
    在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，这一小撮反动分子竟胆敢与中国人民为敌，妄想继续作恶，这是每一个爱国的中国人民不能容忍的，更是每一个爱国的天主教徒不能容忍的。全国爱国反帝的天主教教友们和神甫们应当团结起来！把帝国主义者及其走狗肃清出去！
