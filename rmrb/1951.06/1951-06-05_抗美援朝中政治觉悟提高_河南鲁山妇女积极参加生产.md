To the Editor:

　　Since liberation, the women of Lushan County, Henan Province, have raised their awareness and actively participated in production work during the Resist America and Aid Korea movement. In Shiqiao Township, District Seven, at a meeting on April 29 denouncing counter-revolutionaries, 36 women expressed their determination to mobilize their husbands to participate in revolutionary work and defend their good life after liberation. Liu Fengying, a female cadre from Malou Township in District Three, traveled over a hundred miles to capture the escaped bandit leader Wang Yongrang after sharing her grievances. Many farmers have already made plans to organize mutual aid teams.

　　According to a survey of eight key townships including Yincun and Malou, women account for 60 percent of the total population and 93 percent of the total labor force participates in agricultural production. A total of 771 women's mutual aid teams have been established throughout the county, with 7,358 women joining the teams. The Yang Fuyu mutual aid team in Yincun Township has exceeded its spring production plan. The original plan was to plant four mu of tobacco, but they actually planted four and a half mu; the original plan was to raise ten silkworm egg sheets, but they are now raising thirteen; the plan for the first half of the year was to spin 59 jin of thread, and by the end of May, 36 jin had already been spun. This spring, women throughout the county hoed a total of 36,518 mu of wheat. The Li Guimei women's mutual aid team in Malaozhuang Township, District Four, had eight members who hoed wheat in the morning and attended people's school in the afternoon from March 11 to 19. In eight days, they hoed 35 mu of their own wheat fields and helped four military families, including Jiao Guanglin, hoe 20 mu. They also actively participated in water conservancy construction. In March, Jia Guihua and Pan Guihua, female members of the Hanxin Township in District Nine, led 73 young men and women in active work, and in five days they repaired a section of canal that was 1.6 zhang wide, 2 zhang deep, and 18 zhang long. This spring, women throughout the county opened a total of 79 irrigation and drainage canals, benefiting an area of over 6,200 mu, accounting for one-third of the total number of canals opened in the county.

　　In production, many female models have also emerged. Li Shubin, a female party member from Zhangzhuang Township, District Two, led women throughout the township in planting trees, planting a total of 6,650 trees (cooperating with the government in afforestation, the seedlings were purchased by the government). Li Guifen from Sunzhuang Village, District Two, took the lead in weaving belts in mid-March, weaving a total of 330 pairs in one month. Under the leadership of these model figures, a surge of women in Lushan County participating in production has formed.

　　抗美援朝中政治觉悟提高  河南鲁山妇女积极参加生产编辑同志：
    解放后的河南鲁山县妇女在抗美援朝运动中觉悟提高，积极参加生产工作。七区石桥乡，四月二十九日开控诉反革命分子的大会上，有三十六个妇女当场表示态度，要动员自己丈夫参加革命工作，保卫翻身后的好日子。三区马楼乡妇女干部刘凤英经过诉苦，到百余里外去抓漏网匪首王永让。不少的农民已订出计划，组织互助组。
    根据尹村马楼等八个重点乡的调查，妇女占总人口的百分之六十，劳动力总数百分之九十三参加了农业生产。全县共成立了妇女互助组七百七十一个，七千三百五十八个妇女加入了互助组。尹村乡杨福玉互助组，春季生产已超过计划，原计划种烟四亩，实际种了四亩半；原计划喂家蚕十席，现在喂了十三席；上半年计划纺线五十九斤，至五月下旬止已纺了三十六斤。全县妇女今春共锄麦三万六千五百一十八亩，四区马老庄乡李桂梅妇女互助组，八个人在三月十一日到十九日，上午锄麦，下午上民校读书，八天中锄了自家的麦地三十五亩，并帮助军属焦光林等四户锄了二十亩。她们并积极参加了兴修水利，九区韩信乡妇女团员贾桂花，潘桂花，三月间领导着七十三个男女青年积极工作，五天内她们修好了一丈六尺宽，二丈深，十八丈长的一段渠。全县妇女今春共开了灌溉和排水渠七十九道。受益面积达六千二百多亩，占到全县开渠总数的三分之一。
    在生产中，也出现了许多妇女模范，二区张庄乡妇女党员李淑宾，领导全乡妇女植树，共种了六千六百五十棵（与政府合作造林，苗是政府买的）。二区孙庄村李桂粉，在三月中旬，带头织带子，一月内共织三百三十付。在这些模范人物带领之下，鲁山县妇女参加生产形成热潮。
