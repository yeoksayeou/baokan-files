　　(Xinhua News Agency, Rome) Rome dispatch: In the elections for the provincial and municipal councils held on June 10th in thirty provinces in northern, central, and southern Italy, the People's Front, led by the Communist Party, achieved another major victory, while the ruling Christian Democratic Party suffered another crushing defeat.

　　This is the third and final part of the Italian local autonomous body elections. The results of the thirty provincial council elections already announced by the Italian Ministry of the Interior, as well as the results of the municipal council elections announced successively in various places, are sufficient to prove that the votes obtained by the People's Front have not only greatly increased compared with the 1948 parliamentary elections, but have also exceeded the votes obtained by the Christian Democratic Party.

　　According to the Italian Ministry of the Interior, the People's Front received 180,000 more votes than the Christian Democratic Party in the thirty provincial council elections. Out of a total of 6,562,981 valid votes, the People's Front received 2,530,153 votes, accounting for 38.5% of the total; while the Christian Democratic Party only received 2,351,018 votes, accounting for 35.9% of the total. Compared with the 1948 parliamentary elections, the Christian Democratic Party lost more than 950,000 votes; if the votes lost in the two elections on May 27th and June 3rd are added together, it lost a total of 2,497,768 votes. "Unità" pointed out: "The Christian Democratic Party has suffered an unprecedented and major defeat."

　　Although the number of votes for the People's Front has greatly increased and the number of votes for the Christian Democratic Party has greatly decreased, the right-wing group led by the Christian Democratic Party, relying on the anti-democratic election law, has usurped control of more than 280 city municipal councils from the People's Front. For example, in Turin, a major industrial city in northern Italy, the People's Front received 180,221 votes, while the Christian Democratic Party received only 148,339 votes. However, because the reactionary new election law allows various right-wing parties to form alliances, the Christian Democratic Party group still obtained an absolute majority of two-thirds of the municipal council with a slight majority. In Florence, Piacenza, and many other cities, the Italian reactionaries have excluded democratic forces in such an utterly shameless manner.

　　However, despite all these conspiracies and tricks by the reactionaries, the People's Front still won 345 seats out of the 849 seats in the thirty provincial councils, six more than the Christian Democratic Party. At the same time, the People's Front won an absolute majority in Livorno, Modena, Taranto, and fourteen other provincial capitals and hundreds of municipal councils. Moreover, it also achieved victory in Brindisi Port, which was originally in the hands of the Christian Democratic Party. This is an important port for unloading American war materials, which has caused serious concern to the American and Italian reactionaries. The will shown by the Italian people in this election has made it impossible for U.S. imperialism to hide its panic. In commenting on the election results, the Associated Press of America, in a dispatch from Rome on the 13th, could not help but sadly admit: "Despite spending millions of dollars to pull Italy into the Western camp, it is still to no avail."

### 意人民阵线在地方选举中获胜  加斯贝利反动派遭挫败美帝国主义极惊慌

　　意人民阵线在地方选举中获胜
    加斯贝利反动派遭挫败美帝国主义极惊慌
    【新华社讯】罗马消息：在六月十日举行的意大利北部、中部和南部三十个省省、市政委员会选举中，以共产党为首的人民阵线又获得了一次重大的胜利，而执政的基督教民主党遭到了又一次惨败。
    这是意大利这次地方自治机构选举的第三部分，亦即最后一部分。意大利内政部已经公布的三十个省省政委员会选举的结果以及陆续发表的各地市政委员会选举的结果，已足以证明人民阵线所得的选票不仅比一九四八年议会选举时大大增加，而且已超过了基督教民主党所得的选票。
    据意大利内政部公布：在三十省省政委员会选举中，人民阵线所获得的选票比基督教民主党多了十八万票。在全部六百五十六万二千九百八十一张有效选票中，人民阵线共得二百五十三万零一百五十三票，占总数百分之三十八点五；而基督教民主党只得二百三十五万一千零一十八票，占总数百分之三十五点九。和一九四八年议会选举比较，基督教民主党丧失了九十五万以上的选票；如果和五月二十七日及六月三日两次选举中所丧失的选票加在一起，就一共丧失了二百四十九万七千七百六十八票。《团结报》指出：“基督教民主党遭到了空前未有的大失败。”
    虽然人民阵线的票数大大增加，而基督教民主党的票数大大减少，但是，以基督教民主党为首的右翼集团靠着反民主的选举法，反而从人民阵线手里篡窃了二百八十多个城市市政委员会的控制权。例如在意大利北部的工业大城都灵，人民阵线共得十八万零二百二十一票，而基督教民主党却只有十四万八千三百三十九票，但是，因为反动的新选举法允许各右翼党派结成联盟，因此基督教民主党集团还是以微细的多数而取得了市政委员会中三分之二的绝对多数。在佛罗伦萨，在皮亚森萨以及其他许多城市，意大利反动派都是以这样无耻透顶的方法排除了民主力量。
    但是，尽管有反动派的这一切阴谋诡计，人民阵线仍然在三十省省政委员会全部八百四十九个席位中取得了三百四十五席，比基督教民主党还多六席。同时人民阵线在里窝那、摩登纳、大兰多等十四个省会和几百个市政委员会取得了绝对多数。而且，还在原来掌握在基督教民主党手里的布林的西港取得了胜利。这是起卸美国战争物资的一个重要港口，美意反动派对此已感到严重忧虑。意大利人民在这次选举中所表现出来的意志已使美帝国主义不能自掩其惊慌。美国合众社罗马十三日电在评论这次选举结果时，也不能不悲哀地承认：“尽管花了好几百万美元，要把意大利拉入西方阵营，也还是无济于事。”
