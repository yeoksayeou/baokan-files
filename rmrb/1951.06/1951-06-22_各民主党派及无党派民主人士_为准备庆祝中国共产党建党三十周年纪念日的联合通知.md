Joint Notice from Various Democratic Parties and Non-Party Democratic Personages on Preparing for the Celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China

The 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China—"July 1st"—is fast approaching. We, the various democratic parties, non-party democratic personages, and the broad masses of people throughout the country, are all enthusiastically cheering for the glorious birth of this great leading party of China.

Since China had the Communist Party, the victorious history of the Chinese People's Revolution began. With thirty years of arduous, heroic, and progressive struggle, it correctly led the Chinese people to overthrow the long-term feudal rule, eliminate the reactionary regime of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and expel the imperialist forces of aggression, transforming the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China into an independent, unified, free, and happy new country, and it has the strength to strike against aggression and defend world peace.

The Communist Party of China is now leading the entire Chinese people in carrying out the three major struggles of resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, as well as various construction undertakings of New Democracy, steadily moving towards the bright and far-reaching future of socialism and communism.

Among the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, with Marxist-Leninist theory, Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian fighting actions, and the most progressive party style, fundamentally transformed Chinese society, united and educated the Chinese people, and, with its great revolutionary achievements in China, inspired the development of the revolutionary situation in Asia and the world.

The Communist Party of China, which originated from the most outstanding Chinese working class and has been tempered for a long time, is not only a great revolutionary party unprecedented in Chinese history; it has also become one of the greatest proletarian revolutionary parties in the world. Only under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and within the People's Democratic United Front led by the Communist Party of China can the democratic parties and non-party democratic personages follow the correct revolutionary line, unite and progress, serve the people, and make contributions to the country. We, the various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, are deeply honored that China has the greatest people's leader Mao Zedong and the most progressive leading party, and we sincerely thank and love them. We must always follow it forward. We unanimously believe that "July 1st"—the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China—is a great festival that we should all celebrate warmly together. We hereby jointly notify the local party organizations and non-party comrades throughout the country to actively prepare and participate in the celebration.

(1) Party organizations and non-party comrades throughout the country should jointly launch large-scale mass celebration rallies in their localities, present flags to pay tribute, and issue congratulatory messages and telegrams.

(2) In order to gain a deeper understanding of this glorious festival, all party members and non-party comrades in various localities should promptly arrange various welcoming steps, conduct studies on the revolutionary history of the Communist Party of China, and use various methods such as lectures, symposiums, broadcasts, writing articles, publishing special journal issues, and newspaper supplements to conduct propaganda and education to the people connected with them, to enhance political awareness and boost work enthusiasm.

(3) In order to express more profoundly the sincere support and acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, efforts should be made to expand the People's Democratic United Front, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, strengthen the unity of all parties, classes, and nationalities, consolidate and develop the organizations of one's own party, study Marxist-Leninist theory and Mao Zedong Thought, and improve the theoretical level; in particular, it is necessary to earnestly study the working methods of the CPC and learn from its firm struggle, selflessness, loyalty, honesty, modesty, prudence, and ability to serve the people wholeheartedly.

(4) Celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China requires improving the efficiency of work in resisting America and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, as well as various construction undertakings and production labor, and ensuring the completion of tasks. At present, we should respond to the recent three major calls of the General Association to Resist America and Aid Korea and actively promote the movement to donate airplanes and artillery.

(5) After celebrating the "July 1st" anniversary, local party organizations should make a summary and report it to the central authorities of their respective organizations; non-party comrades can also write individual or joint summaries and publish them publicly.

　　各民主党派及无党派民主人士
    为准备庆祝中国共产党建党三十周年纪念日的联合通知
    中国共产党建党三十周年的纪念日——“七一”就快到了，我们各民主党派、无党派民主人士及全国广大人民，都为了中国这一伟大领导党的光荣诞辰而踊跃欢呼。
    中国自从有了共产党以后，才开始了中国人民革命胜利的历史；它以三十年艰苦卓绝英勇迈进的斗争，正确地领导着中国人民推翻了长期的封建统治，消灭了蒋匪帮的反动政权，驱逐了帝国主义的侵略势力，把一个半封建半殖民地的旧中国改变成独立、统一、自由、幸福的新国家，而且有力量打击侵略、保卫世界和平。
    中国共产党现在正领导着全中国人民进行胜利的抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革三大斗争，以及新民主主义的各种建设事业，稳步走向社会主义、共产主义光明远大的前途。
    中国共产党在中国人民群众之中，以马克思列宁主义理论，毛泽东思想，无产阶级的战斗行动与最进步的党的作风，从基本上改造了中国社会，团结和教育了中国人民；并且以它在中国伟大的革命成就，鼓舞了全亚洲和全世界革命形势的发展。
    从最优秀的中国工人阶级中所产生而又久经锻炼的中国共产党，不但是中国历史上前所未有的伟大革命政党；也已经成为世界上最伟大的无产阶级革命政党之一。中国各民主党派及无党派民主人士只有在毛泽东思想指导之下，在中国共产党所领导的人民民主统一战线之中，才能遵循着正确的革命路线，团结进步，为人民服务，有所贡献于国家。我们各民主党派及无党派民主人士，深以中国有了最伟大的人民领袖毛泽东和最进步的领导党为光荣，衷心感谢和爱戴，一定要永远跟着它前进。我们一致认为“七一”——中共建党三十周年纪念日是我们大家所应当共同热烈庆祝的大节日，特联合通知全国各地方党派组织和无党派同志们，一致主动地积极地准备和参加庆祝。
    （一）全国各地党派组织和无党派同志们应在当地联合发动规模盛大的群众庆祝大会，献旗致敬，及发表庆贺文电。
    （二）为了更深入地认识这一光荣的节日，凡我各地党派及无党派同志们应及时布置各项迎接步骤，进行关于中国共产党革命历史的学习，并向自己所联系的人民群众采用讲演、座谈、广播、写文章、出期刊专号、报纸特刊等各种的方法，进行宣传教育，以提高政治认识，鼓舞工作热情。
    （三）为了以更进一步的行动表现对中国共产党的衷诚拥护、接受领导，应努力扩大人民民主统一战线，巩固人民民主专政，加强各党派各阶级各民族的团结，巩固与发展自己党派的组织，学习马克思列宁主义理论及毛泽东思想，提高理论水平；尤其要认真学习中共的工作方法，学习它坚决奋斗，大公无私，忠诚老实，谦虚谨慎，善于为人民群众服务的作风。
    （四）庆祝中国共产党的建党纪念日，要提高对抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命，以及各种建设事业、生产劳动的工作效能，保证完成任务。目前更应当响应抗美援朝总会最近的三大号召，积极推动捐献飞机大炮的运动。
    （五）各地党派组织于庆祝“七一”纪念之后，应作出总结，分别报告各组织的中央；无党派的同志们，亦可写出个人的或联名的总结公开发表。
