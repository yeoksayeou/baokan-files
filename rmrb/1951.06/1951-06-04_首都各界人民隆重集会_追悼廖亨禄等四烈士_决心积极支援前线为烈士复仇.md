　　The Capital's People Hold Solemn Meeting to Commemorate Martyrs Liao Henglu and Three Others
    Resolved to Actively Support the Front and Avenge the Martyrs
    The people of the capital held a solemn memorial meeting on the 2nd to mourn Liao Henglu, Chang Baokun, Cheng Shutang, and Wang Ligao, four martyrs who gloriously sacrificed their lives while the Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea was offering condolences on the Korean battlefront. Nearly five thousand people attended, including responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations, representatives from all walks of life in the capital, cadres from the military and government organs, all members of the Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea, and family members of the martyrs. Choi Young, Counselor of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, also attended the meeting.
    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the meeting, presented wreaths to the four martyrs and then addressed the meeting. Then Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Comfort Mission to Korea, introduced the brief biographies of the four martyrs and their active work during the comfort mission to Korea.
    Representatives who spoke at the meeting included Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Wei Chuantong, Secretary-General of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Nie Zhen, Chairman of the North China Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea Association; Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; and Lian Kuoru, Director of the Beijing New Opera Research Institute.
    In his speech, Chen Shutong first expressed the highest respect and deepest condolences of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to the four martyrs. He said: "The four martyrs gloriously sacrificed their lives for justice, for resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and for overthrowing American imperialism and striving for world peace. The sacrifice of these four martyrs only increases our hatred for the enemy. The people of the whole country should warmly respond to the call of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association regarding the promotion of patriotic pacts, the donation of airplanes and cannons, and the preferential treatment of the families of martyrs and revolutionary servicemen, actively support the front, and avenge the four martyrs."
    Wei Chuantong, Secretary-General of the General Political Department, said in his speech that it is necessary to inherit their legacy, and to launch the Resist America, Aid Korea movement more deeply and universally among all the People's Liberation Army, to protect the security of our motherland and the peace of the East and the world. He said: "The blood of the four martyrs is mixed with the blood of the martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and the Volunteers and the People's Army will work harder to avenge them. They died in the line of duty while conveying the will of the people of the motherland to the front line in Korea, and the people of the motherland and the Chinese People's Liberation Army also vow to demand this blood debt from the American imperialists."
    In their speeches, Nie Zhen, Zhang Youyu, and Lian Kuoru all expressed their intention to mobilize the people of the whole country to warmly respond to the call of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, actively support the front, and avenge the four martyrs.
    Choi Young, Counselor of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Chinese people's sending a comfort group to Korea to comfort the Korean People's Army, the Korean people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers greatly encouraged the Korean people's belief in the victory of the liberation war and further strengthened their fighting will. The four martyrs gloriously sacrificed their lives, and their blood will not be shed in vain. Their sacrifice has made the fighting friendship between the two peoples, forged with blood, even more consolidated.
    Finally, family members of the martyrs spoke. Chang Lian'an, the father of martyr Chang Baokun, said: "Although my son is dead, his spirit is not dead, and the people of the whole country are mourning him." Cheng Gengguang, the son of martyr Cheng Shutang, said: "I will study hard and work hard to serve the people better in the future. I will also write to the uncles and elders of the Volunteers, asking them to kill more American devils to avenge the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for patriotism."
