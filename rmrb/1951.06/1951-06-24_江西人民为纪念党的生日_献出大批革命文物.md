　　Jiangxi People Offer a Large Batch of Revolutionary Cultural Relics to Commemorate the Party's Birthday
    The people of Jiangxi Province have offered a large number of precious cultural relics from the period of the Agrarian Revolution as gifts to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. This batch of cultural relics totals more than 220 pieces. Among them is Chairman Mao's "Examples of the Life of Chinese Tenant Farmers" written in March 1927 (this is an investigation into the life of Chinese peasants written by Chairman Mao based on materials provided by Zhang Lianchu, a tenant farmer from Xixiang, Xiangtan County, Hunan in 1926), which had long been lost due to the war; the "Struggle News," the organ of the Central Bureau of the Soviet Area of the Communist Party of China published in 1933, and the "Youth Truth News," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League in the Soviet Area; various revolutionary slogans, leaflets, and hand-copied work reports printed during the era of the Ruijin Democratic Government; as well as various seals (stamps), certificates of revolutionary people's organizations at that time, and various currencies issued in the Soviet Area.
    After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north from Jiangxi to resist Japan, the people of Jiangxi, with their infinite love for the Communist Party of China, firmly believed that the Chinese people would surely complete the revolutionary victory under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, they risked their lives for more than ten years to carefully preserve these revolutionary cultural relics.

　　江西人民为纪念党的生日  献出大批革命文物
    江西省各地人民献出大批土地革命时代的珍贵文物，作为纪念中国共产党三十周年的献礼。该批文物共二百二十余件。其中有因战争而早经散失的毛主席在一九二七年三月所作的《中国佃农生活举例》（这是毛主席根据一九二六年湖南湘潭县西乡佃农张连初所谈材料，写成的一篇中国农民生活的调查），有一九三三年出版的中国共产党苏区中央局机关报《斗争报》和中国共产主义青年团苏区中央机关报《青年实话报》，瑞金民主政府时代印发的各种革命标语、传单、手抄的工作报告，以及当时革命人民团体的各种印信（图章）、证件和在苏区发行的各种货币等。
    中国工农红军从江西北上抗日以后，江西人民怀着对中国共产党的无限热爱，坚信中国人民必将在中国共产党领导下完成革命胜利。所以，他们在国民党匪帮的血腥统治下，十余年间冒着生命危险珍重地保存下了这些革命文物。
