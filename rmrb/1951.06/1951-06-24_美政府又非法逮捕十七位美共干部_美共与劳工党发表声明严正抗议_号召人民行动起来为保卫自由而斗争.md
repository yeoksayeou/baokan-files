Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: New York news: Following the U.S. Supreme Court's approval on June 4 of the New York Federal Court's unconstitutional verdict against eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, the U.S. government has even more unscrupulously launched further persecution against the American Communist Party. J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the U.S. intelligence agency FBI, jointly ordered with Attorney General McGrath on the 20th the arrest of seventeen cadres of the American Communist Party in New York and Pittsburgh, and is searching for another four American Communist Party cadres. On the 20th, the Federal Grand Jury filed a lawsuit against these twenty-one people based on the so-called Smith Act, which the U.S. judicial authorities used to sentence the eleven leaders of the American Communist Party, with the "crime" still being the previously fabricated so-called "incitement to overthrow the government by violence." Those arrested began to be tried in New York on the 20th.

The seventeen American Communist Party cadres who have been arrested are: Israel Amter, Marion Maxwell Bachrach, Isidore Begun, Alexander Bittelman, George Blake Charney, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Betty Gannett, Simon William Gerson, Victor Jerome, Arnold Samuel Johnson, Jones, Albert Francis Lannon, Jacob Mindel, Peter Pere, Alexander Leo Trachtenberg, Louis Weinstock, William Wolf Weinstone.

The four American Communist Party members who are being unreasonably searched for are: Fred Fine, James Edward Jackson, William Norman Maron, Sidney Steinberg.

This arrest once again exposes the sinister attempt of the reactionary rulers of the United States to further push the United States towards fascism.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: TASS News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch: American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis issued the following statement regarding the arrest of Communist Party cadres:

"Is our country about to replay the tragedy of the infamous Palmer Raids of the 1920s, in which thousands of innocent men and women were arrested for their political beliefs? This morning, the political police—FBI agents—suddenly searched the homes of seventeen American men and women. Households across the country must be asking this question in their hearts upon hearing this news.

These innocent men and women have been arrested, leaving behind wives and children. Among the wives who have lost their husbands, one is about to give birth in a few weeks. Those arrested also include seventy-year-old Amter, who is almost paralyzed, and sixty-nine-year-old Mindel, who is bedridden with heart disease. Among those arrested is Flynn, who has been known to American labor for the past forty-five years. Others include: three World War II veterans, prominent trade union leaders, black men and women, and social figures.

The tyrannical arrest of seventy-year-old Amter and sixty-nine-year-old Mindel is tantamount to killing them. However, even worse than this act of contempt for etiquette is the contempt for the people of the whole country and their freedom. The fact is very clear that, aside from the larger issue, we can see that it is a shameless act by the FBI to exert pressure on Supreme Court Justice Jackson. Because the eleven leaders of the Communist Party requested the Supreme Court to review their case, to extend their bail period during the review of the appeal, and to postpone the execution of the judgments against their lawyers, Jackson will hear their arguments on June 21.

We see this as a tyrannical act, attempting to stifle all criticism and opposition in the country to the government's suicidal war policy... This tyrannical arrest, which is being carried out at a time when the universally opposed universal military training system is about to be passed, is the first result of the Smith Act. Unless the people of the whole country take action to defend the freedoms that are disappearing, such things will happen more often. If Communist and non-Communist citizens can be arrested without evidence, then can any other American, regardless of his political views or beliefs, feel safe when criticizing the government's war policy?

These arrests will surely awaken the conscience of the people of the whole country. The true target of this atrocity is precisely the people of the whole country and the cause of peace. Every citizen, especially workers, regardless of their views, should currently express their opposition to this brutal, inhumane, and thought-controlling arrest."

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: TASS News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch: American Labor Party Executive Secretary Shutzer issued the following statement, condemning the U.S. government's arrest of Communist Party leaders:

"The recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, passed by a vote of six to two, which virtually nullifies the First Amendment to the Constitution, has now begun to produce evil results. The arrest of seventeen people on the morning of June 20, based on this decision, is a replay of the Palmer Raids (Note: Palmer was the U.S. Attorney General in the 1920s - Editor's note). Today, the knock on the door may still be to find Communists; tomorrow, it may be to find Democrats, American Labor Party members, trade union leaders, black leaders - any American who refuses to bow to the official policy of war, speculation, and suppression of the people's freedoms.

The actions taken on the morning of June 20 must awaken millions of Americans, making them realize the current and clear danger: under the guise of implementing the Smith Act, their freedoms will be universally destroyed.

Now, it is the sacred, urgent, and patriotic duty of all Americans - regardless of their political affiliations - to demand that the Supreme Court review the case so that the Bill of Rights can be restored. The voice of the people can and must exceed the knocking of the Palmer Raiders on the doors of American homes."

　　美政府又非法逮捕十七位美共干部
    美共与劳工党发表声明严正抗议
    号召人民行动起来为保卫自由而斗争
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：紧接着美国最高法院于六月四日批准纽约联邦法院对美国共产党十一位领袖违宪判决以后，美国政府又更加肆无忌惮地对美国共产党发动了进一步的迫害。美国特务机关联邦调查局局长胡佛已于二十日与司法部长麦格拉斯会衔下令，在纽约和匹兹堡逮捕了美国共产党十七名干部，并正在搜捕另外四名美共干部。二十日当天，联邦大陪审团根据美国司法当局据以对美共十一位领袖判刑的所谓史密斯法，对这二十一个人提起公诉，“罪名”还是前此捏造的所谓“教唆以暴力推翻政府”。被捕者已于二十日起在纽约受审。
    已被逮捕的十七名美共干部是：伊斯台尔·阿姆脱，玛丽翁·马克斯慧尔·巴奇拉奇，伊萨多尔·皮根，亚历山大·毕特曼，乔治·布莱克·却尔尼，伊里沙白·葛莱·佛林，蓓蒂·茄纳特，西蒙·威廉·基尔逊，维克多·季洛姆，阿诺德·撤缪尔·约翰逊，琼恩斯，阿尔培·法兰西斯·兰农，约可勃·明德尔，皮的斯·培里，亚历山大·里奥·特拉奇腾堡，路易·万斯道，威廉·伍尔夫·万斯东。
    正被无理搜捕的四名美共党员是：弗列德·范因，詹姆士·爱德华·杰克逊，威廉·诺曼·马伦，塞德尼·斯坦因堡。
    这次逮捕事件再次暴露了美国反动统治者决心把美国更加推向法西斯化的罪恶企图。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国共产党总书记但尼斯就逮捕共产党干部事件发表声明如下：
    “我国又将重演二十年代无辜男女数千人因为自己的政治主张而横遭逮捕的，恶名昭彰的派尔默搜捕事件的惨剧吗？今天清晨，政治警察——联邦调查局人员——突然搜查了十七名美国男女的住宅，全国各地家家户户听到这个消息，心里一定会发出这样的疑问。
    这些无辜的男女被逮捕了，抛下了妻子和儿女。在失掉丈夫的妻子中，有一个在几个星期内即将分娩。被捕的还有几乎瘫痪了的七十岁的阿姆脱；因心脏病卧病在床的六十九岁的明德尔。被捕者中间，有过去四十五年来美国劳工所熟知的佛林。其他有：三位第二次世界大战的退伍军人，著名的工会领袖，黑人男女，以及社会名流。
    横暴地逮捕七十岁的阿姆脱和六十九岁的明德尔，无异于杀害他们。然而，比这蔑视礼义的行为更甚的是蔑视全国人民及其自由。事实很明白，撇开更大的问题不谈，我们可以看到，是联邦调查局力图对最高法院法官杰克逊运用压力的无耻行为。因为共产党十一位领袖请求最高法院复审他们的案件，在审查上诉书期间，延长他们的保释期限，并且缓期执行他们的律师所受的判决，而杰克逊将于六月二十一日听取他们的上诉理由。
    我们看到，这是一种横暴的行为，力图窒息全国对政府所实行的自杀战争政策的一切批评与反对。……正当要通过到处都反对的普遍军训制度的时候进行的这种横暴的逮捕，是史密斯法的第一批结果。除非全国人民行动起来，保卫正在消失的各项自由，这种事情会更多发生。如果共产党的与非共产党的公民可以毫无证据而横遭逮捕，那末还能有任何别的美国人，不论他的政见或信仰如何，能在批评政府的战争政策的时候，感到安全吗？
    这些逮捕必将唤起全国人民的良心。这种暴行的真正目标正是针对着全国人民与和平事业的。每个公民，特别是工人，不论见解如何，目前应该表示反对这种残暴的、不人道的、管制思想的逮捕。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国劳工党执行书记舒泽尔发表下列声明，谴责美国政府逮捕共产党领袖：
    “美国最高法院最近以六对二通过的决定，无形中取消了宪法第一条修正案，现在已开始产生邪恶的结果了。根据这个决定在六月二十日清晨逮捕十七个人的事件，乃是派尔默搜捕事件的重演（按：派尔默是二十年代的美国司法部长——编者注）。今天来敲门也许还是来找共产党人；明天就可能是来找民主党人、美国劳工党人、工会领袖、黑人领袖——任何拒绝向官方决定的战争、投机及镇压人民各项自由的政策屈膝的美国人。
    六月二十日早晨所采取的行动一定会唤醒千百万美国人，使他们认识到目前这种现实而明白的危险：在实施史密斯法的伪装下，他们的各项自由将遭到普遍的毁灭。
    现在，要求最高法院重审，俾使权利法案得以恢复，乃是一切美国人——不论他们的政治关系如何——的神圣的、迫切的、爱国的责任。人民的呼声能够并且必须超过派尔默搜捕者在美国家宅的门上的敲门声。”
