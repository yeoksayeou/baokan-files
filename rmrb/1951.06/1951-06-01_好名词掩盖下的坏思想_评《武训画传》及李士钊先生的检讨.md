　　Bad Ideas Masked by Good Words
    ——A Critique of "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" and Mr. Li Shizhao's Self-Criticism
    Zhang Zaixue
            (I)
    Participating in the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the demand to not limit this discussion to the already clarified truth about Wu Xun's ideology, but to gradually delve deeper into the ideological roots of why Wu Xun was revered, why he was praised, and why he was promoted, and to conduct concrete analyses and strict self-criticisms, has already been raised in readers' letters to the People's Daily. Wu Xun's ideology manifests in various degrees in the ideological activities of Wu Xun's admirers, but no matter how it manifests, its essence is the same. Therefore, some participants in the discussion do not conceal their thoughts simply because they have not yet surfaced or have not been expressed much. On the contrary, they expose them, because they fully recognize the harm of Wu Xun's ideology to the Chinese people. Only by fundamentally exposing and eliminating this ideology can we take a step forward in raising ideological understanding. I believe this spirit of self-criticism is very good and is a spirit that a revolutionary should have.

    After reading the self-criticism of Mr. Li Shizhao, the compiler of "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" and an active promoter of Wu Xun's ideology, I believe his spirit of self-criticism is insufficient, and his understanding of the errors is worth studying. What is even more regrettable is that he did not connect it to his long-term planned propaganda of Wu Xun's ideology in his specific remarks, and did not touch upon the ideological essence that ran through these remarks. This is the same as the "critical retention" method he used in "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures," only seeing some abstract words and phrases, and it is difficult to find content that has a specific relationship with the words and phrases. Of course, the content is there, which is "being influenced by others." I fully acknowledge the role of the spread of objective ideas in the formation of subjective ideas to a certain extent, but this does not mean that the role of subjectivity can be erased. Taking the cultural and ideological dynamics of the same period as an example, there was the promotion of Wu Xun's ideology from Cai Yuanpei to Tao Xingzhi, and at the same time, there was Mr. Lu Xun's opposition to Wu Xun's ideology. The compiler of the picture biography accepted the former's ideas and rejected the latter, which shows that the responsibility cannot be completely shirked onto objective influences. Moreover, taking "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" alone, in the compiler's propaganda of Wu Xun's lifestyle and introduction of Wu Xun's specific relationship with the feudal ruling forces, not only can it be seen that the compiler's spirit is completely in tune with Wu Xun's spirit, but also that he has developed and enriched the "Wu Xun spirit." It is not only "intentionally deleting some of Wu Xun's backward views," but also intentionally supplementing some of Wu Xun's backward views; not only did he not "correct all the far-fetched and incorrect statements," but he also strengthened the far-fetched and incorrect statements, creating myths about Wu Xun's deeds (the compiler himself must take responsibility for this). To illustrate the above points, I will bring up some of the relevant content in "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures" for the compiler and participants in the discussion to discuss together.
            (II)
    Under the oppression of feudal society and the feudal system, the lack of land forces peasants to sell their labor to maintain the most basic life. This situation is out of necessity and is very tragic. Although labor creates value, this value does not belong to oneself; although they are regarded as beasts of burden by the wealthy gentry and landlords, they themselves do not want to be regarded as beasts of burden; although happiness can be generated in labor, oppressed and exploited labor will never produce happiness. This is not some profound philosophy, but something that ordinary oppressed laborers can understand. However, the compiler of the picture biography praises this labor under feudal oppression, saying that this labor "is a very glorious thing," saying that Wu Xun "works and rests on time to exercise himself," saying that Wu Xun gives others manure "considering it a very meaningful labor," saying that Wu Xun pulls a stone roller for others "gladly doing it without fear of hardship." Moreover, the compiler especially introduced Wu Xun's song "praising this labor production method." This song was sung by Wu Xun when he was grinding for others:
    "No need for a yoke, no need for a halter, no need for dry soil to pad the grinding path."

    The compiler also emphasized annotating the content of the lyrics, writing: "A yoke is a tool for harnessing animals. Whether oxen, horses, or mules are grinding, they always defecate and urinate in the mill, and dry soil must be constantly used to pave or clean every day. Manual grinding does not require these troubles."
    What a "no need for these troubles"! This is the authentic tone of the landlord class. That is to say, Wu Xun (and all peasants who sell their labor) is a humanoid animal that does not need animal yokes and does not defecate and urinate casually. He is more welcome to the landlords than cattle and horses. Everyone, come and learn this "labor spirit" that claims to be stronger than cattle and horses!
    If Wu Xun indeed had this perverted spirit a hundred years ago, then the biographer a hundred years later is still praising this spirit, praising the inferiority complex of laborers under feudal oppression. Is this due to limited historical knowledge?

    Because the compiler starts from this point of view, he repeatedly emphasizes the happiness of laborers under feudal oppression, using phrases such as "calm and composed," "gladly doing it," and "using singing to express the happy mood inside" to praise this happiness that does not actually exist. Moreover, he extends this inferiority complex to all humble and flattering behaviors towards the landlord feudal forces. Here, there are Wu Xun's own songs, as well as annotations with "new content" supplemented by the compiler. For example:

    When Wu Xun was acting as a horse for the landlords' children to ride, he sang: "I'll be the horse, let you ride. You pay the money, I'll do the work… Ride steadily, climb quickly, I'm happy, you're at ease." The compiler added a sentence here: "He climbed back and forth very seriously." This means that not only should he climb, but he should climb seriously. Whose tone is this! For example:

    When Wu Xun was treating teachers, school directors, and gentlemen to wine, he not only kowtowed to express his gratitude but also insisted on not taking a seat. He said (that is, the compiler said): "I dare not sit with you gentlemen. I feel at ease and happy standing outside the door." Standing outside the door is not enough, but he must happily stand outside the door. Moreover, the compiler regards eating other people's leftover tea and food as an "admirable" "spirit of diligence and willingly enduring hardship." Whose tone is this! For example:

    When Wu Xun was begging for food, "sometimes those landlords and bullies would speak to him sternly, but he would still treat them with a very gentle attitude. He said: 'Grandpa, Uncle, don't be angry. I'll leave whenever you're not angry.'" The compiler not only titled this "begging with a kind attitude" but also praised this "kindness" as "tolerance and an indomitable fighting spirit." Here, we can hear the landlords and bullies shouting through the compiler's tone: "You must have 'kindness' and 'tolerance' towards me. If you use this 'fighting spirit' to 'fight' me, I am very welcome!"

    Undoubtedly, in "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures," the compiler is everywhere promoting this "fighting spirit." The specific content of this "fighting spirit" is to endure beatings, endure scolding, kowtow, and worship. (The compiler said in his self-criticism: "Wu Xun never knelt down and kowtowed to people indiscriminately." This is true; Wu Xun always kowtowed to the feudal forces but not to the oppressed.) The compiler promotes this spirit to tell the oppressed not to fight back when beaten, not to answer back when scolded; moreover, to regard the most unbearable things in the world as happy things. "Struggle," "struggle," in the dictionary of Wu Xun's promoters, is actually another name for surrender!
            (III)

    The compiler of the picture biography said in his self-criticism that he committed the error of "far-fetchedness." On the surface, this is correct, but in essence, it has not yet touched the subject. I might as well give a few more examples for everyone to see.

    The compiler said that Wu Xun "opposed foot-binding for women," but in the story narrated by the compiler, it is only mentioned that when Wu Xun saw the young girls crying because of foot-binding, he said two sentences: "Eldest sister, second sister, don't cry. Build a free school to study." What opposition to foot-binding is this?

    The compiler said that Wu Xun "opposed superstition." The basis is still only Wu Xun's two sentences: "Going to the temple to burn incense is not as good as respecting your parents at home." This only says that "respecting parents" is more effective than "burning incense." How can we draw the conclusion of "opposing superstition"?

    The most difficult to understand is the extent to which Wu Xun was welcomed by the "masses" because of his "virtue." The compiler wrote: "Once, just as Wu Xun walked to the door of a house, a white dog and a black dog ran up to him, barking and biting. He looked at them and shouted: 'Black dog, white dog, don't bite. I, Wu Doumo, have come to promote free schools.' The dogs immediately lowered their heads, flattened their ears, wagged their tails, and showed a welcoming look. Naturally, all the old and young in this family came out to greet him with beaming faces." You see, even dogs welcome Wu Xun like this. Wouldn't we be ashamed of the dogs if we didn't welcome him?

    Wu Xun's worshippers once shouted loudly that Wu Xun should be pulled from the high sky of being half-god, half-human to the human world. Where exactly have they pulled him to now?

    However, the people of Shandong during the Qing Dynasty had long made a definite evaluation of Wu Xun. They gave Wu Xun a nickname called "Doumo." According to the explanation of the people of Shandong, Doumo is douzha, which represents something of the least value. This nickname vividly illustrates Wu Xun's spiritual face and is the most suitable hat to wear on Wu Xun's head. However, the compiler wanted to take this hat off Wu Xun's head, explaining the origin of the nickname as being because Wu Xun once foamed at the mouth. This is truly a painstaking effort of people who planned to promote Wu Xun. Forcing a hat that cannot be worn onto his head, and wanting to take off the hat that should be worn. Is this due to limited historical knowledge? Is this committing an "error of objectivism"? Is it because Wu Xun's "own subjective conditions were subject to various limitations" and he could only create a "ordinary and great career" for him to be taken over by successors?
            (IV)

    The compiler said in the preface: "Mr. Wu Xun's personality and career were not only praised by the broad masses of working people, but also praised by the feudal rulers of the Qing Dynasty and the warlord bureaucratic rulers of the Beiyang government. They were used to deceive the people in order to consolidate their reactionary rule. We have critically retained all these facts." Good, on the one hand, there is criticism, and on the other hand, there is retention. Now let us see how he is criticizing and how he is retaining.

    On the one hand, the compiler retained with an envious tone "the imperial gift of a yellow mandarin jacket... to show commendation, Emperor Guangxu approved 'as requested, the Ministry of Rites knows' on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year" (this is specific retention); on the other hand, he said, "This is used by the feudal rulers to buy loyal slaves and numb people's minds" (this is formal criticism). We can ask the compiler, since you said that it was used by the feudal rulers to buy loyal slaves and numb people's minds, why did you deliberately put it in the picture biography to numb people's minds?

    On the one hand, the compiler retained with an envious tone "Emperor Guangxu personally wrote the plaque 'Happy to Do Good Deeds'" (this is specific retention, and a picture was added); on the other hand, he said, "Wu Xun did not understand what benefit this would bring to his free school? What help would it be to poor children to study?" (This is formal criticism). If neither Wu Xun nor the compiler of the biography understood, would they have included it in the picture biography?

    On the one hand, it is said that Wu Xun was enshrined in the local sage temple of three counties after his death (added picture, specific retention); on the other hand, it is said that if Wu Xun were alive, he would inevitably refuse (formal criticism. The compiler has not yet refused, so would Wu Xun refuse?). On the one hand, it is said that Wu Xun shared sacrifices with Confucius (added picture, specific retention); on the other hand, he complained that others should not have forced the two of them together (formal criticism. Didn't the compiler and illustrator also force the two of them onto one picture?)!

    There is no end to such examples. In a word: what is "criticized" are empty "revolutionary" words, and what is retained are specific feudal contents. This method of "critical retention" is indeed a direct product of the Wu Xun spirit; it is just like those people who have in fact accepted unclean gifts sent by others, criticizing these gifts with a full mouth as being undesirable.
            (V)

    Covering bad ideas with good words, decorating reactionary content with all kinds of revolutionary phrases, this is the characteristic of the painstaking propaganda of "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures," the film "The Life of Wu Xun," and other current "progressive" Wu Xun worshippers. They dare not face the truth of history, dare not face the power of the people who have changed the face of history and the achievements of the people's revolution; instead, they put that slave Wu Xun, who had paralysis on the historical stage, fitted him with two fake legs of "asceticism" and "promoting education," posing as a representative of the working people in history, loudly promoting him to the ideological field to carry out activities; on the one hand, begging for the victory and glory of the working people that he should not have, on the other hand, giving alms to the petty bourgeoisie's reformism and capitulationist ideas. In order to decorate the facade, they spare no effort to pile all the best nouns on the head of this dirty figure; calling the traitor of the oppressed class a "pioneer," calling wholehearted service to the feudal rulers "wholehearted service to the people," calling class deception "class friendship," and calling the most typical and concrete feudalist who sold himself into servitude as "the most typical and concrete practitioner of historical materialism"... These statements, which confuse black and white and reverse right and wrong, are like Wu Doumo standing a tripod (that is, standing a dragonfly), putting the sky under his feet and putting the earth on his head, letting the entire objective world stand upside down before his eyes. It should be stated that this distorted and upside-down view of history is a concrete reflection of the reactionary bourgeois idealism, a concrete reflection of reformism wearing revolutionary uniforms, and at the same time, a concrete reflection of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie's favorite split between revolutionary theory and revolutionary practice.

    Lenin said in "Old Errors in New Times, in New Forms" written in 1921:
    "Every specific transformation in history always causes certain changes in the form of petty-bourgeois vacillation, which is always adjacent to the proletariat and always infiltrates the ranks of the proletariat to some extent.
    "Petty-bourgeois reformism, that is, covering up the slavish behavior shown in front of the bourgeoisie with good democratic or 'social' democratic words and weak wishes; and petty-bourgeois revolutionism, that is, being majestic, arrogant, and exaggerated in words, but in reality, being scattered, superficial, and mindless, - these are the two major 'trends' of this vacillation."

    Although Lenin's words are aimed at certain elements who broke away from the revolution after the October Revolution, they are still a very appropriate criticism for the petty bourgeoisie in the process of China's revolution.

    Studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought seriously and throwing oneself into the fiery revolutionary struggle is the only way to correct all erroneous ideas.
            (VI)

    Now I want to talk about the drawing problem in "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures." I believe that, judging only from the author's drawing method, it is by no means what the preface author said was "adopting new techniques and angles." In fact, it is the opposite; it adopts old techniques and wrong angles. The illustrator, in addition to treating the representative figures of feudalism relatively politely, very emphatically depicts the shortcomings in the images of the Chinese working people (such as men's bare chests, women's bound feet, and clothing postures, etc.). These shortcomings were created single-handedly by the sinful feudal social system, but the illustrator regards them as laughingstocks to attract readers, manipulating them in large quantities in the paintings and exaggerating and uglifying these images, even on innocent children. Seriously speaking, this angle of taking images is the angle of the "foreign masters" watching the Chinese people from a curious point of view; this drawing technique is no different from the techniques that Western painters who came to China's paradise for adventure in the past liked to manipulate. As a Chinese painter, using this technique and angle is a concrete manifestation of losing the standpoint of the Chinese people and lacking national self-esteem.

    Because the illustrator is using the same ideological angle and the same drawing technique to deal with the images of the characters, even Wu Xun, who the author himself praised as "a concrete representative of peasant labor models," did not treat him as an admirable character and give him the respect he deserved, but also put a stroke of white powder on his nose; thus, Wu Xun, who appeared in the picture biography as a clown, harmoniously coincided with Wu Xun who appeared on the historical stage in spirit. This is an unexpected success of the illustrator, although this unexpected success has been criticized by Wu Xun's supporters, saying that the author drew Wu Xun not like a working people but rather like a clown (see Guangming Daily on February 26: "The Life of Wu Xun" movie and "The Biography of Wu Xun in Pictures"). We can also question the critic of the picture biography: why do you only oppose the author drawing Wu Xun as a clown, but not oppose the author drawing other working people as clowns and colorful dancers?

    In addition to this, the content expressed by the illustrator on the screen is completely faithful to the writer's text content. He did not add or subtract anything, which shows that the illustrator has the same point of view as the writer; he tried his best to serve the writer, which also shows the artistic nature of the general illustrators who do not pay attention to ideological content; because of this, I cannot help but think of certain individual phenomena existing in the art world, of those art workers who are shouting to improve technology but neglect to improve their thinking, of those who are satisfied with the quantity of creations and despise the quality of creations, of those who, although not illustrators, are indeed illustrators of superficial life phenomena or of other people's thoughts in a practical sense... This is worthy of our attention, and we must have this feeling, and the errors of Wu Xun's picture biography should be regarded as a serious warning to the art cause!

　　好名词掩盖下的坏思想
    ——评《武训画传》及李士钊先生的检讨
    张再学
            （一）
    参加电影《武训传》的讨论，不把这种讨论局限在已经明确了的武训思想真象的范围之内，而逐渐深入地将为什么崇拜武训、为什么歌颂武训、为什么宣传武训等等思想联系起来，并加以具体的分析和严格的检讨，这种要求已经在人民日报的读者来信中提出来了。武训思想在武训崇拜者的思想活动中有各种程度不同的表现，但无论怎样表现，它的实质都是一样。因此，有些参加讨论者并不因为他的思想尚未表面化、或者表露得不多就把它隐蔽起来，相反地却把它暴露出来；这由于他们充分认识到武训思想对于中国人民的危害性，只有从本质上揭露和清除这种思想，才有可能把思想认识提高一步。我认为这种检讨精神是很好的，也是一个革命者应有的精神。
    当我读了《武训画传》的编写者和武训思想的积极宣传者李士钊先生的自我检讨以后，我认为他的检讨精神是不够的，对于错误的认识也是很值得研究的。更为遗憾的是他没有联系到他长期有计划地宣传武训思想中的具体言论，没有接触到他在这些言论中所贯穿的思想本质。这就和他在《武训画传》中所运用的“批判的保留”方法一样，只看见一些抽象的词句，很难找出与词句有具体关系的内容。当然，内容是有的，这就是“受了别人的影响”。我完全承认客观思想的传播对于主观思想形成的一定程度的作用，但是这不是就可以抹煞主观的作用。以同一时期的文化思想动态来说，既有从蔡元培到陶行知的推崇武训思想，同时也有鲁迅先生的反对武训思想；画传的编写者接受了前者的思想而拒绝了后者，这就说明了不能把责任完全推诿到客观影响的身上去。而且，单以《武训画传》来说，编写者在宣传武训生活方式和介绍武训与封建统治势力的具体关系里面，不仅可以看出编写者的精神与武训精神完全合拍，而且还发扬了和丰富了“武训精神”；不但是“有意的删除了武训的若干落后观点”，而且是有意的补充了武训的若干落后观点；不但没有“纠正一切附会的不正确的说法”，而且还加强了附会的不正确的说法，创造了武训事迹的神话（这就不能不让编写者自己来负责任）；为了说明以上各点，我将《武训画传》中一些与此有关的内容，提出来和编写者及参加讨论者共同商榷。
            （二）
    在封建社会和封建制度的压迫下面，缺少土地的农民以出卖劳动力来维持最起码的生活，这情况是出于不得已的，而且是十分悲惨的。尽管劳动创造了价值，但是这种价值并没有属于自己；尽管被豪绅地主们当作牛马看待，但他们自己并不愿意被当作牛马看待；尽管在劳动中可以产生快乐，但是被压迫被剥削的劳动绝对不会产生快乐；这不是什么高深的哲理，是一般被压迫的劳动者都能体会到的事情。可是，画传的编写者却在歌颂这种封建压迫下的劳动，说这种劳动“是很光荣的事情”，说武训“按时劳动按时休息是锻炼着自己”，说武训给别人出粪“视为是一件很有意义的劳动”，说武训给人家拉砘子是“不辞艰苦的欣然乐为”。而且，编写者特别介绍了武训“赞颂这种劳动生产方式”的颂歌，这首歌是武训在给别人推磨时唱出的：
    “不用格拉不用套，不用干土垫磨道。”
    编写者并且着重地给歌词内容加了注解，他是这样写的：“格拉是套牲口的工具。不论牛马骡子拉磨时，总在磨房里拉屎屙尿，必须不断用干土来铺垫或天天打扫，用人力推磨是不需要这些麻烦的”。
    好一个“不需要这些麻烦”，这是道地的地主阶级的口吻。也就是说，武训（和一切出卖劳动力的农民）是一个既不用牲口套子又不随便拉屎屙尿的人形牲口，他比牛马更受地主欢迎，大家来学习这种自诩比牛马更强些的“劳动精神”呀！
    如果一百年以前的武训的确有这种变态精神的话，那末，一百年以后的传记编者却还在歌颂这种精神，歌颂着封建压迫下劳动者的自卑情绪，这难道是由于历史知识有限的缘故吗？
    由于编写者是从这样的观点出发，他就一再强调在封建压迫下的劳动者的快乐，用了一些“泰然自若”、“欣然乐为”、“用唱歌表现内心愉快的情绪”等等词句，来颂扬这种实际不存在的快乐。而且还把这种自卑情绪扩展到对于地主封建势力的一切卑贱的讨好的行为上去；这里有武训自己的歌，也有编写者所补充的“新的内容”的注解。比如：
    武训在给地主的小孩们当马骑的时候，他唱道：“我做马，让你骑，你出钱，俺出力……骑的稳，爬的快，俺高兴，你自在”。编写者就在这里补充了一句：“他都很认真的爬来爬去”。这就是说，不仅要爬，而且要认真的爬。——这是什么人的口吻呢！又比如：
    武训在招待教师、学董和绅士们吃酒的时候，自己除了磕头致谢以外，并且坚持不肯入席。他说（也就是编者说）：“我不敢和诸位先生们坐在一起，我站在门外，觉得心安，觉得快乐。”站在门外还不算，而且要快乐的站在门外；而且编写者还把吃别人的残茶剩饭，当作“令人钦佩”的“勤苦自甘精神”。——这是什么人的口吻呢！又比如：
    武训在要饭的时候，“有时那些地主恶霸之流对他声色俱厉，他仍然以很温和的态度相对。他说：‘大爷大叔别生气，你几时不生气，俺几时就出去。’”编写者在这里不但以“要饭的态度和气”为标题，而且把这种“和气”称颂为“雅量和坚韧不拔的斗争精神”。在这里，我们可以听见地主恶霸们在通过编写者的口气大叫：“你们对我要有‘和气’和‘雅量’呀，你们如果用这种‘斗争精神’来‘斗争’我，我是非常的欢迎呀！”
    毫无疑问地，在《武训画传》里面，编写者处处都在宣传这种“斗争精神”，这种“斗争精神”的具体内容就是忍打、受骂、磕头、跪拜。（编写者在检讨中说：“武训绝不是见了人就下跪磕头。”这是实在的，武训总是给封建势力磕头而没有给被压迫者磕头。）编写者宣传这种精神，就是叫被压迫者挨打不要还手，挨骂不要还口；而且，要把天下最不能忍受的事情都当作快乐的事情。“斗争”，“斗争”，在武训宣传者的字典里，原来是投降的别名！
            （三）
    画传的编写者在检讨中说自己犯了“附会”的错误，从表面上看是对的，从实质上看就还没有接触到本题。我不妨再举几个例子给大家看看。
    编写者说武训“反对女子缠足”，但在编写者所叙述的故事中，只提到武训看见少女们因为缠足而痛哭的时候说了两句话：“大姑二姑你别哭，修个义学来念书。”这是什么反对缠足呢？
    编写者说武训“反对迷信”，根据仍然只是武训的两句话：“上庙去烧香，不如在家敬爹娘。”这只是说：“敬爹娘”比“烧香”有更大的灵验，怎么能得到“反对迷信”的结论呢？
    最难理解的，是编写者所叙述的武训因了他的“德行”而受到“群众”欢迎的程度了，编者是这样写的：“有一次武训刚走到一家门口，有一只白狗和一只黑狗跑来向他汪汪的咬，他看着喊：‘黑狗白狗你别咬，俺武豆沫义学症来到了。’那狗马上就俯首、贴耳、摇头、摆尾的表现出欢迎的样子，自然这一家老老少少，更加眉飞色舞的出来迎接他了。”你看，狗尚且这样欢迎武训，我们要是不欢迎岂不对狗有愧么？
    武训的崇拜者们，曾经大嚷大叫地说应该把武训从半神半人的高空中拉到人间来，现在到底把他拉到哪里去了哩？
    然而，满清时代的山东人民，是早就给武训下了定评的，他们给武训起了一个绰号叫做“豆沫”。根据山东人的解释，豆沫就是豆渣，是代表一种最不值钱的东西的意思。这个绰号生动地说明了武训的精神面貌，是戴在武训头上一顶最合适的帽子。可是，编写者却想把这顶帽子从武训头上取下来，把绰号的来源解释为武训曾经口吐白沫的缘故。这真是有计划宣传武训的人们的一件苦心的工作。不能戴的帽子拚命往他头上戴，应该戴的帽子又想把它取下来；这难道是由于历史知识有限的缘故吗？这难道是犯了“客观主义的错误”吗？这难道是因为武训“本身的主观条件受了种种的限制”，只好由后继者给他创造出一件“平凡而伟大的事业”来吗？
            （四）
    编写者在自序中说：“武训先生的人格事业，不但为广大的劳动人民所歌颂，满清王朝的封建统治者，北洋政府的军阀官僚统治者，都曾加以褒扬。利用来欺骗人民，以巩固自己的反动统治，这些事实我们也都加以批判的保留下来”。好，一方面是批判，一方面是保留，现在我们来看他是在怎样的批判和怎样的保留。
    编写者一方面用羡慕的口吻保留了“钦赐黄马褂……以示旌奖，光绪皇帝某年某月某日批准‘著照所请，礼部知道’”（这是具体的保留）；一方面又说“这是封建统治者们用来收买忠实奴隶麻醉人心”（这是形式的批判）。我们可以问问编者，既然你说是封建统治者用来收买忠实奴隶和麻醉人心的，为什么你又偏偏摆在画传里来麻醉人心呢？
    编写者一方面用羡慕的口吻保留了“光绪皇帝亲自写了乐善好施的匾额”（这是具体的保留，还加了一张画）；一方面又说“武训不了解这对他的义学有什么益处？对穷孩子们念书有什么帮助？”（这是形式的批判）。如果武训和传记的编者都不了解的话，那还会把它列入画传里来吗？
    一方面说武训死后曾经入祀三县乡贤祠（加画，具体的保留）；一方面又说如果武训在世的话，必然会加以拒绝（形式的批判。编者尚且没有拒绝，武训还会拒绝么？）。一方面说武训与孔子同享祭祀（加画，具体的保留）；一方面又埋怨别人不该把他们两个硬拉在一起（形式的批判。编绘者不是也把他们两个硬拉在一幅画面上么？）！
    这类例子是举不完的。一句话：“批判”的是空洞的“革命”词句，保留的是具体的封建内容。这种“批判的保留”方法，的确是武训精神的直接产物；就好像那些事实上已经收下了别人送来的不干净的礼物的人们，满嘴在批评着这些礼物是要不得的一样。
            （五）
    以好名词掩盖坏思想，以一切革命词句来装饰反动的内容，这就是《武训画传》、电影《武训传》以及当前其他的“进步的”武训崇拜者们的苦心宣传的特色。他们不敢正视历史的真实，不敢正视已经改变了历史面貌的人民的力量和人民革命的斗争成果；却把那个在历史舞台上害了疯瘫病的奴才武训，装起“苦行”和“兴学”的两条假腿，冒充历史上劳动人民的代表，大吹大擂地抬到思想领域里来进行活动；一方面乞讨着他不应该有的劳动人民的胜利与光荣，一方面又施舍着小资产阶级的改良主义和投降思想。他们为了装饰门面，不惜把一切最好的名词都堆在这个肮脏人物的头上；把被压迫阶级的叛卖者说成“先觉者”，把全身心为封建统治者服务说成“全身心为人民服务”，把阶级欺骗说成“阶级友爱”，把最典型最具体的封建主义卖身投靠者说成为“最典型最具体的历史唯物主义的身体力行者”……这些黑白不分、是非倒置的说法，就如同武豆沫竖鼎（即竖蜻蜓）似的，将天放脚下，将地放在头上，让整个客观世界都在眼前倒立起来。应该说明，这种歪曲历史的倒立的看法，是反动的资产阶级的观念论的具体反映，是改良主义穿上革命制服的具体反映，同时，又是革命的小资产阶级最喜欢把革命理论与革命实践分裂开来的具体反映。
    列宁在一九二一年写的《新时光、新形式的旧错误》里说：
    “历史上每一次特有的转变，总是引起小资产阶级动摇性在形式上的某些变动，这种动摇随时都与无产阶级毗邻着，随时都在某种程度上侵入到无产阶级队伍里。
    “小资产阶级的改良主义，即借良善民主主义或‘社会’民主主义词句和软弱愿望掩盖着，而在资产阶级面前所表现出的奴仆行为；以及小资产阶级的革命主义，即口头上威风凛凛，骄大浮夸，实际上则是散漫、虚浮、毫无头脑的空架子，——这就是这种动摇性的两大‘潮流’。”
    列宁的话虽是针对着十月革命以后的某些脱离革命的分子而言，但对于中国的革命行进中的小资产阶级来说，仍然是一个非常合适的针砭。
    认真的学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，严肃地投身到火热的革命斗争中去，这是纠正一切错误思想的唯一办法。

    现在要谈谈武训画传的绘图问题。我认为，仅从作者的画法来说，也决不是序作者所说的“采取了新的技巧和角度”的，事实上恰恰相反，是采取了旧的技巧和错误的角度。绘图者除了比较客气地对待封建代表人物以外，却非常强调地描写了中国劳动人民形象上的缺点（如男性的赤膊、女性的小脚和服装姿态等等）。这些缺点是罪恶的封建社会制度所一手造成的，而绘图者却把它当作吸引读者的笑料在画幅中大量地搬弄，并且十分夸张地丑化了这些形象，即使在无邪的儿童身上也不例外。认真地说，这种采取形象的角度，是站在猎奇观点上的“洋大人”看中国人民的角度；这种作画技巧，与过去那些到中国乐园里来冒险的西洋画匠们最喜欢搬弄的技巧并无二致；作为一个中国画家来说，运用了这种技巧和角度，正是丧失中国人民立场和缺乏民族自尊心的具体表现。
    由于绘图者是在同一个思想角度和同一个作画技巧之下来处理人物形象的，所以，连作者自己誉为“农民劳动模范的具体代表人物”的武训，也没有把他当作一个可以钦佩的人物来给予应有的尊敬，也一视同仁地在他鼻子上抹上了一笔白粉；于是，以小丑姿态出现于画传中的武训，就非常谐和地，与出现于历史舞台上的武训发生了高度的精神契合；这是绘图者的意外成功之处，虽然这一意外的成功受到了武训拥护者的指责，说作者把武训画得不像劳动人民倒反而像一个三花脸（见二月二十六日光明日报：武训传电影和武训画传）。我们也可以质问画传的指责者：为什么你仅仅反对作者把武训画成三花脸，而不反对作者把其他的劳动人民都画成为丑角和彩旦呢？
    除此以外，绘图者在画面上所表现的内容，是完全忠实于编写者的文字内容的，他没有增加什么或减少什么，这说明绘图者与编写者具有同等的观点；他竭力做到为编写者服务，这也说明了一般毫不重视思想内容的插图画家的艺人本色；因为这样，我就不能不联想到存在于美术界的某些个别现象，联想到那些正在大喊提高技术、而忽视提高思想的美术工作者们，联想到那些满足于创作数量、而轻视创作质量的作品经营者们，联想到那些虽然不是插图画家，但实际意义上的确是给浮面的生活现象作插图、或者给别人的思想作插图的画家们……这值得我们大家注意，我们一定要有这样的感觉，应该将武训画传的错误，当作是对于艺术事业的一个严重的警告！
