On Purifying the Russian Language
    Lenin

    Editor's Note: This famous short article by Lenin was written in 1919 or 1920 and was published in Pravda on December 3, 1924, after Lenin's death. It was later included in Volume 24 of the Complete Works of Lenin. This short article criticizes the remnants of the old Russian aristocratic habit of interspersing French or a mixture of French and Russian in the Russian language. This criticism is also applicable to the habit of some people in our country who like to intersperse English or "Pidgin English" in Chinese.

    We are spoiling the Russian language. Misusing foreign words. And using them incorrectly. Why say "defect" when you can say defect, shortcoming, or loophole? (Note 1)

    Of course, a person who has just learned to read in general, especially to read newspapers, will unintentionally absorb some of the vocabulary in the newspapers as he concentrates on reading them. It just so happens that the language of our newspapers is also deteriorating. If a person who has just learned to read can be forgiven for using foreign words as something novel, then this cannot be forgiven for a writer. Isn't it time for us to declare war on the abuse of foreign words?

    Frankly speaking, if the abuse of foreign words makes me angry (because it damages our influence on the masses), then some of the errors in the newspapers drive me crazy. For example, using the word "budirovat" (Note 2) to replace arouse, awaken, or waken. However, the French word "bouder" (Note 3) means to sulk or be angry. Therefore, the word "budirovat" actually means "to be angry" or "to sulk." Imitating the use of a mixture of French and Russian is equivalent to imitating the worst of the worst representatives of the Russian landlord class, who had studied French but had neither learned it well nor spoiled the Russian language.

    Isn't it time to declare war on the phenomenon of spoiling the Russian language?

　　论清洗俄国语言
    列宁
    编者按：列宁的这篇著名的短文写于一九一九年或一九二○年，在列宁逝世后发表于一九二四年十二月三日真理报，后来收入列宁全集第二十四卷。这篇短文批评的是喜欢在俄语里夹用法语或者法俄混合语的旧俄贵族习气的残余。这个批评，对于我国有一部分人喜欢在汉语里夹用英语或者“洋泾滨英语”的习气，也是适用的。
    我们在败坏俄国语言。滥用外来语。用得又不正确。在可以说缺陷、缺点或漏洞的时候，为什么要说“代费克特”（注一）呢？
    当然，一个刚刚学会一般阅读、特别是学会阅读报纸的人，在他专心阅读报纸的时候，会在无意中吸收一些报纸上的语汇。正好我们的报纸的语言也在败坏起来了。如果一个刚刚学会阅读的人把外来语当作新奇的东西使用，还可以原谅的话，那末，对于一个作家，这就不可以原谅了。难道现在还不是我们向滥用外来语的现象宣战的时候吗？
    老实说，如果滥用外来语会使我生气（因为这损害我们对群众的影响），那末，报纸上所出的一些错误，就会使人气疯了。例如，用“布吉洛瓦齐”（注二）一词来代替激起、推醒、唤醒。然而法文“布代”（注三）一词却是生气、愤怒。因此，“布吉洛瓦齐”一词实际上就是“生气”、“愤怒”。模仿使用法俄混合语，就等于模仿那些学过法文，但是一来没有学好，二来又把俄国语言糟踏了的，俄国地主阶级的最坏最坏的代表。
    向糟踏俄国语言的现象宣战，难道现在还不是时候吗？
    （注一）这是ДЕфЕКТ的译音，这个字是从法语ｄｅｆｅｃｔ借来的
    俄语。——译者
    （注二）这是俄语БУДИРОВАТъ的译音。这个字是从法语“布代
    ”造出来的俄语。——译者
    （注三）这是法语ｂｏｕｄｅｒ的译音。——译者
