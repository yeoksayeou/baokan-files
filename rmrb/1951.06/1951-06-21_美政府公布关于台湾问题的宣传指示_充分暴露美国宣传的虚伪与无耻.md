Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: After fierce arguments, the Joint Meeting of the US Senate Military and Foreign Affairs Committees passed on June 1st a resolution to disclose a propaganda policy directive on the Taiwan issue issued by the State Department on December 23, 1949. The publication of this top-secret document of the US government fully exposes the hypocrisy and shamelessness of American imperialism's propaganda.

The reason the State Department issued this directive at the time was "to formulate propaganda policies to minimize damage to American prestige and the morale of other countries caused by the possible fall of Formosa (referring to Taiwan as "Formosa" is the last provision of this propaganda directive) to the CCP forces (referring to the Chinese People's Liberation Army)." The so-called "morale" here refers to the counter-revolutionary confidence of the reactionaries in the imperialist camp.

The directive stated: "It is generally anticipated that the island will fall; under the rule of the Kuomintang, the civil and military situation there has deteriorated, which has further strengthened this expectation. The loss of Formosa may cause: (1) the United States to lose prestige at home and abroad... (2) Damage to the morale of other countries, especially those in the Far East..."

Therefore, the State Department instructed that the propaganda should deny "the United States has any special interest or ambition in the island," and should insist that "the United States has never had a military base there and has never sought any privileges," and it could admit that Taiwan "is politically, geographically, and strategically a part of China," and should say "it is not particularly outstanding or important," and should not "mention anything that would indicate that the island has important strategic significance."

The directive explained that the reason the US government had to carry out propaganda in this way was because it believed that at that time, there was a lack of public opinion preparation for taking further military action against Taiwan, making it impossible to conceal its "militarism, imperialism, and intervention" face, and it might involve the United States in a "long-term adventure" for which it was not prepared.

All of this, in the US's announcement of military occupation of Taiwan today, has become a sharp irony to the US government. Precisely because of this, Acheson had tried his best to oppose the publication of the propaganda instruction, but his political enemies still decided to publish it for their own electoral interests. This makes the hypocrisy and shameless nature of American-style propaganda completely exposed.

Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: TASS Moscow, June 10th: Izvestia international affairs commentator Kudryavtsev commented on the US State Department's instruction to US consulate officials on December 23, 1949, regarding the situation in Taiwan, believing that this document exposed the lies and slander of the US imperialists' loudspeaker—the notorious "Voice of America."

Commenting on the content of this instruction, Kudryavtsev said that the State Department believed that if Chiang Kai-shek was driven out of Taiwan, it would be another blow to the United States' prestige in Asia. Therefore, on December 23, 1949, it issued a secret instruction to consulate officials and the "Voice of America" radio station, ordering them to step up propaganda in order to "avoid creating an impression" that the United States had any special interests in Taiwan or any military bases in Taiwan, or that the United States had any intentions towards them. As Acheson announced at the Senate committee meeting on June 1, the instruction talked about how to use the "Voice of America" and the American diplomatic system to mitigate the damage that might be caused if Taiwan fell. In simple terms, a formal order was issued to the "Voice of America" on how to spread false information about American policy.

It is not difficult to understand why the head of the State Department was alarmed by the Senate committee's decision to publish this exposé of shady secrets.

Kudryavtsev concluded by saying that, however, the panic of the unlucky "Voice of America" commanders obviously came too late. People of all countries around the world have long known the true value of the propaganda tricks of imperialist aggressors.

### 美政府公布关于台湾问题的宣传指示  充分暴露美国宣传的虚伪与无耻

　　美政府公布关于台湾问题的宣传指示
    充分暴露美国宣传的虚伪与无耻
    【新华社十八日讯】美国参议院军事及外交两委员会联席会议于六月一日经过激烈争吵后，通过了公布国务院于一九四九年十二月二十三日所发的一项关于台湾问题的宣传政策指示。这个美国政府绝密文件的公布，充分暴露了美帝国主义宣传的虚伪与无耻。
    国务院当时发出这个指示的原因是：“拟订宣传政策以尽量减少美国的威望与其他国家的民气因福摩萨（把台湾称做“福摩萨”是这个宣传指示最末一项规定的）可能陷落于中共部队（指中国人民解放军）而遭到的损害。”这里所谓“民气”是指帝国主义阵营各国反动派的反革命信心。
    指示说：“普遍都预料该岛将陷落；在国民党的统治下，那里的民政与军事情况已趋恶化，这种情形更加强了这种预计。福摩萨的丧失可能使：（一）美国在国内外丧失威信………（二）其他国家，尤其是远东各国的民气受到损害……。”
    因此，国务院训令在宣传中要否认“美国对该岛怀有特殊兴趣或野心”，要硬说“美国在那里从来没有过军事基地，也从未想取得任何特权”，可以承认台湾“在政治上、地理上、战略上都是中国的一部分”，要说“它一点也不特别出色或者重要”，而且不要“提到任何会表示该岛有重要战略意义的话”。
    指示解释说：美国政府之所以不得不这样来进行宣传，是因为它认为，当时对台湾采取进一步军事行动，还缺乏舆论准备，无从掩饰自己的“军国主义、帝国主义和干涉”的面目，而且可能卷入美国准备未就的“长期的冒险”。
    所有这一切，在美国已经宣布对台湾实行军事占领的今天，都成了对美国政府的尖锐讽刺。正因为如此，艾奇逊曾竭力反对将该宣传指示发表，但是，他的政敌们为了本身的选举利益，却仍然决定将它发表。这就使得美国式宣传的虚伪和无耻的本质完全暴露无遗。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：消息报国际问题评论家库德里雅夫采夫评论美国国务院于一九四九年十二月二十三日就台湾情势致美国领事馆职员的指示，认为这个文件暴露了美国帝国主义者的谎言和诽谤的传声筒——臭名昭彰的“美国之音”的活动。
    库德里雅夫采夫评论这一指示的内容说，国务院认为，如果蒋介石被逐出台湾，就会又一次打击美国在亚洲的威信，因此于一九四九年十二月二十三日对领事馆职员及“美国之音”电台发出秘密指示，要他们加紧宣传，以便“避免造成一种印象”，使人认为美国在台湾或台湾的任何军事基地上有任何特殊利益，或认为美国对它们有任何打算。正如艾奇逊于六月一日在参院委员会会议上所宣布的，这个指示所谈的是如何利用“美国之音”和美国外交系统来减轻一旦台湾失守所可能产生的损害。简单地说，向“美国之音”发出了对美国的政策如何散布虚伪消息的正式命令。
    这位国务院首脑因参议院委员会决定发表这一揭露阴私的指示而惊惶失措是不难理解的。
    库德里雅夫采夫在结语中说，然而倒运的“美国之音”的指挥者们的惊惶失措显然来得太晚了。全世界各国人民早就知道了帝国主义侵略者的宣传伎俩的真实价值。
