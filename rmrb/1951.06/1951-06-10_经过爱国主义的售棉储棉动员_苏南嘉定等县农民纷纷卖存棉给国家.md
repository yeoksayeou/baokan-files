　　After Patriotic Cotton Sales and Storage Mobilization

　　Farmers in Jiading and Other Counties in Southern Jiangsu Actively Sell Stored Cotton to the State

　　Since the end of April, cotton farmers in Jiading, Baoshan, Taicang, and other counties in Southern Jiangsu, through in-depth education and mobilization by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's cotton purchasing stations, the People's Bank, cooperatives, and local government cadres at all levels, have stimulated patriotic enthusiasm, broken the erroneous concept of valuing goods over currency, and actively sold their stored cotton to the state.

　　Starting from April 23, the Jiading cotton purchasing station, in conjunction with the People's Bank and the Cooperative General Office, organized working groups to conduct typical experiments in areas such as Malu and Nanxiang. With the help of the local government and Party committee, patriotic cotton sales and storage mobilization was carried out through district and township farmers' representative meetings, blackboards, and farmers' spare-time schools, explaining that the state urgently needed cotton, and that storing and selling cotton was a concrete action to resist America and aid Korea. At the same time, the reasonable cotton prices and cotton principal-protected savings methods stipulated by the government were explained, as well as various policies encouraging production, to dispel farmers' concerns about selling cotton. In key villages, the working group convened village cadres and villagers' meetings, using examples of the state guaranteeing cotton farmers' interests to stimulate cotton farmers' patriotic enthusiasm, and organized everyone into groups for casual discussions, raising questions to be patiently answered by the working group and village cadres. In this way, many farmers enthusiastically registered to sell cotton on the spot and challenged each other. After the working group gained experience in the typical experiment, it divided each group into smaller groups and conducted a comprehensive campaign in villages and townships. In early May, work was fully launched at the cotton purchasing stations in Taicang, Baoshan, and other counties to expand publicity. Chen Moguan, a farmer in Fenqiao Township, Taicang County, sold all of his cotton stored for five years and deposited the cotton money in the bank. Farmers in Nanxiang and Malu districts of Jiading sold the quantity of cotton in nine days that met the monthly purchase plan. Now, the stored cotton in Nanxiang District is close to being completely sold. According to statistics from the Jiading cotton purchasing station, the station purchased 8,050 dan of cotton in Jiading, Baoshan, and Taicang counties in May, exceeding the original May purchase plan of 4,000 dan by 101 percent. Cotton farmers in various places are also actively storing cotton. In general districts, cotton money deposited in the People's Bank using the principal-protected method accounted for 30 to 40 percent of the total cotton money. In Nanxiang District, Jiading, 182.03 million yuan was deposited in just over a month. In Waigang District, deposits reached 90 percent of the proceeds from cotton sales. In the purchase of stored cotton, the working group automatically canceled weekly holidays and extended office hours to ensure that cotton was purchased as soon as it arrived. For farmers selling 10 dan or more of seed cotton, the working group sent boats to the villages to purchase it. After the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation purchased the seed cotton, it immediately ginned the cotton seeds and handed them over to the local government to lend to farmers, solving the difficulty of lacking cotton seeds for expanding cotton fields.

　　The development of the cotton sales and savings movement has also greatly promoted the current work of cooperatives in pre-purchasing cotton for this autumn. In many townships in Jiading County, the cotton pre-purchased by cooperatives has reached 80 percent of the yield, and in individual townships, it has reached 100 percent.

　　经过爱国主义的售棉储棉动员
    苏南嘉定等县农民纷纷卖存棉给国家
    苏南嘉定、宝山、太仓等县棉农，自四月底起，经中国花纱布公司收花处、人民银行、合作社及当地各级政府干部深入教育动员，激发了爱国热情，打破了重物轻币的错误观念，纷纷把存棉卖给国家。
    从四月二十三日起，嘉定收花站就和人民银行、合作总社联合组织工作组，到马陆、南翔等区作典型试验。在当地政府和党委帮助下，通过区、乡农民代表会议、黑板报和农民业余学校，进行爱国主义的售棉储棉动员，说明国家正需要棉花，存棉售棉就是抗美援朝的具体行动。同时说明政府规定的合理的棉花价格和棉花保本保值储蓄办法，说明各项鼓励生产的政策，打消农民对售棉的顾虑。在重点村中，工作组召集村干部及村民大会，用国家保障棉农利益的实例激发棉农的爱国热情，组织大家分组漫谈，提出问题，由工作组及乡村干部耐心解答。这样，很多农民当场即热烈登记认售，并互相挑战。工作组取得典型试验的经验后，即将各组分成更小的组，分村分乡全面进行。五月初旬，又在太仓、宝山等县所属收花站全面展开工作，扩大宣传。太仓县分桥乡农民陈摸观，把五年的存棉也全部售出，并把棉款存入银行。嘉定南翔、马陆两区农民，九天中售出棉花的数量即达到一个月收购计划要求的数量。现在南翔区的存棉已接近完全售出。据嘉定收花处统计，该收花处五月份在嘉定、宝山、太仓三县收购棉花八千零五十担，超过五月份原订收购计划四千担的百分之一百零一。各地棉农储棉的也很踊跃。棉款以保本保值办法存入人民银行的，一般区占到棉款总数百分之三十至四十。嘉定南翔区一个多月即存进一亿八千二百零三万元。外冈区存款达售棉所得百分之九十。在收购存棉中，工作组自动取消星期例假，延长办公时间，做到棉花随到随收。农民售棉存籽花十担以上的，工作组派船到村中去收购。花纱布公司收购了籽花以后，立即轧出棉籽，交由当地政府贷给农民，解决了扩大棉田中缺乏棉种的困难。
    售棉储蓄运动的开展，对目前合作社预购今秋棉花的工作，也起了很大的推动作用。嘉定县合作社在许多乡预购的棉花，已达产量百分之八十，个别的乡已达百分之百。
