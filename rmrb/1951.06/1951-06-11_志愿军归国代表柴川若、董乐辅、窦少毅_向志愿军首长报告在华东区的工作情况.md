Respected Volunteer Army Leaders and Comrades!
　　We left Shanghai on March 26th and went to Nanjing, Wuhu, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Nantong, Rugao, Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Danyang, Changshu, Kunshan, Songjiang, Hangzhou, and other cities. Including Shanghai and Jinan, we participated in welcome rallies and gave reports 147 times in the East China region over two months, with an audience of 2,327,600 people. In addition, there were more than 50 welcome and send-off rallies organized by the people at train stations and along the way, and at least one million people met us, including those lining the streets to welcome us. On average, 50,000 to 60,000 people welcomed us and listened to our reports every day.
　　During our time in East China, it was rainy for about half the time, but no rallies were delayed. The Songjiang Special District organized a rally attended by more than 30,000 people, some of whom were farmers who traveled 50 *li* in the rain to participate. The attendees persevered in the rain for three to four hours. In Nantong, more than 60,000 people braved the rain to line the streets to welcome us, standing from 12:00 noon to 6:30 pm. Everyone's clothes were completely wet, but the welcoming ranks remained orderly. In Wuxi, female workers from various silk and yarn factories worked the night shift in order to listen to our reports. They worked all night and came to the rally without eating, standing under the sun for more than five hours. They were all very excited, as if we had won a battle, and forgot their fatigue due to their excitement.
　　When we were in Beijing, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea instructed us to meet with the masses. Indeed, meeting with the masses is a significant task. We took a train from Nanjing to Wuhu, which took more than five hours. The train stations along the way were packed with people, with red flags waving and drums beating everywhere. We got off the train to speak at every small station. At the Dong Station in Dangtu County, more than 20,000 people gathered to welcome us. Amidst the sound of firecrackers, people kept stuffing flowers and gifts into the train car. Workers from Ma'anshan even brought up ore samples. In the train, piles of autograph books were sent over, all from passengers and railway employees. On the day we left Wuhu, more than 70,000 people got up in the middle of the night to see us off. The lines of people stretched from the riverbank to the train station, about ten *li* long. As we waved goodbye to the people from the train window after we boarded the train, a group of male and female students suddenly jumped onto the platform and embraced and kissed our hands and faces. After the train started moving, a group of young men and women ran after the train for a long distance.
　　Our residence was often crowded with young students who waited for hours to shake our hands or ask for our autographs, sometimes blocking traffic at the entrance. Some came in the middle of the night, and some waited until the middle of the night without leaving. Countless people asked us for autographs. This was a very arduous task. Sometimes there were too many, and we couldn't finish signing, so some organizations and schools printed our signatures on plates. A young man named Nie Yingmei in Zhenjiang City wrote in a letter to Comrade Chai Chuanruo: "First, I should thank you for the words you gave me today: 'Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland.' These eight words struck my heart with such weight. Although these eight words are not unfamiliar to me, today I deeply realize how closely related these eight words are. When I received this long-awaited gift, I couldn't help but jump up. I opened my notebook to show it to my friends, and everyone's eyes revealed envy. Everyone was saying, 'Look how lucky you are!' Comrade! Look! The people of the motherland love the representatives of the thousands of volunteer soldiers so much."
　　When we are at the front, the thought of the people of the motherland gives us strength. This time, seeing the love of the people of the motherland for our volunteer soldiers has increased our strength even more. The people of East China also universally reflect: "When we think of the volunteer soldiers, we are full of energy. After listening to your reports and seeing you, we are even more energetic." The people of East China and all of China are determined to support our volunteer soldiers to completely defeat the enemy. From Jinan to Hangzhou, we heard people shouting everywhere: "In order to support the front lines and consolidate national defense, we must ensure that we have grain when grain is needed, money when money is needed, and people when people are needed!" In Zhenjiang, we saw the glorious mother Huang Yalan, who sent all seven of her children to participate in various revolutionary work. She said to us, you are all good children. She also gave each of us three a large diary, with the words written on it: "Fight for the happiness of the thousands of children of the motherland!" In Nanjing, 38% of college and middle school students signed up to join the army. One educated youth named Su Dasheng patiently persuaded his parents five times to sign up for the army. He talked about everything from the history of social development to the financial oligarchy of the United States, and from the victory of the Chinese revolution to resisting America and aiding Korea. Finally, his parents fully agreed to his participation in military cadre school. His father, the deputy manager of the Bank of China, later said to people: "Now I believe that 'Volunteer Army' is completely worthy of the name."
　　In northern Jiangsu, seeing the people of northern Jiangsu overcome the serious famine, we felt the greatness of the people's strength. In southern Jiangsu, visiting the land reform exhibition gave us the best education. In Hangzhou, visiting the local specialty exhibition showed that many of the industrial products participating in the exhibition had caught up with or surpassed the level of capitalist countries. This shows that the people of the motherland are engaged in national construction with a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity after liberation, which makes us believe in our own strength even more and cherish our motherland even more.
　　The people of East China also support us in terms of consolation and relief. According to statistics from the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the entire East China region has sent more than 50 billion yuan to the General Association. Some rickshaw pullers in Nanjing donated the money they earned from pulling rickshaws all day with hard work. An elementary school teacher on Mount Wutai, whose family of nine had a heavy burden, reduced three meals a day to two, saving 30 *jin* of grain, and donated it all. A doorman surnamed Tang in Hangzhou, who now earns only 50,000 yuan per month, recently donated 100,000 yuan and insisted that we personally write a receipt. We personally received a large number of gifts and condolences in East China. The banners alone numbered more than 3,000. Some banners had several thousand signatures on them. One of the banners presented by Zhenjiang City was adorned with commemorative badges from the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The amount of condolences was very large. For example, during our five-day stay in Suzhou, the gifts we personally received included 243 banners, 26 red scarves, more than 27.6 million yuan in condolences, more than 13,900 books, more than 4,900 letters of condolence, more than 1,600 condolence bags, more than 2,200 diaries and exercise books, more than 19,000 towels, more than 1,000 toothbrushes, 223 dozen pencils, 1,126 pairs of military shoes, more than 2,000 bars of soap, more than 350 packages of matches, 2 watches, 32 fountain pens, 1,000 dedications, 2 silver shields, 4 picture frames, more than 100 pairs of socks, and 200 *jin* of wine. In addition, there were bullets, goggles, scrub brushes, paints, seals, shirts, antiques, food, badges, etc. Some gifts had been treasured for decades or even hundreds of years, as well as ribbons from marriage certificates, and many other precious gifts. The Suzhou Branch of the Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea organized more than ten people to specifically manage, inspect, and register these gifts to ensure that they were sent to the front lines. Zhenjiang City gathered the condolences together and arranged them into an exhibition, which thousands of people visited.
　　We saw that the people of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City are enthusiastically carrying out various tasks of resisting America and aiding Korea. The people of Hangzhou are resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. They held rallies of tens of thousands of people, accusing and publicly trying counter-revolutionary elements, held the "May Day" demonstration parade, convened the Provincial Labor Model Conference and the Military Region Combat Hero Conference, and held rallies to welcome us in their busy schedule. In the 15 welcome meetings, large and small, 370,000 people met us. In the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea, according to statistics from the three cities of Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou and 49 counties, as of the end of March, a total of 320 parades of various sizes were held, with a total participation of 5,370,705 people. More than 50,000 farmers in Hangxian County signed up to go to Korea to join the Volunteer Army. As of April 30, the people of the province had donated more than 18.85 billion yuan, as well as more than 3,000 condolence bags, 1,500 pieces of medicine, and more than 190,000 other items, as well as 50,000 books collected by the Xinhua Bookstore. The Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea received and forwarded more than 30,000 letters of condolence.
　　Dear Leaders and Comrades! What we have reported above is only a small part of the phenomena we saw or heard in a hurry during the 40 days after the three of us left Shanghai, but these phenomena have given us a good education and encouragement. These welcome rallies and actual actions are the best political lessons for us. They are the people of East China reviewing their own strength and demonstrating to our enemies. It proves that the 144 million people of East China are fully supporting us. It powerfully demonstrates the unprecedented unity and unparalleled strength of the people of our great motherland. This further enhances and consolidates our confidence in victory, making us feel the loveliness of the people of the motherland and the glory and pride of being a Chinese in the era of Mao Zedong.
　　We saw that the people of the entire East China love the motherland, love peace, and love the fruits of revolutionary victory. They cherish our volunteer soldiers as they cherish their own eyes. Countless people asked us: "What exactly do you need? How do you need us to support you? What shortcomings do you see in our work?" We feel that, in addition to gratitude, the only way we can repay the people's support is to continue to stand at the forefront of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homeland, resolutely strike at the aggressors, and fight until the final victory. We feel that our victory is achieved by relying on the support of the people. This victory is the victory of the people, and this glory is the glory of the people.
　　We must fight under the great banner of patriotism for the complete victory of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homeland! We must fight for the continuous strengthening of our great motherland! Long live our great motherland! Long live Chairman Mao!

　　志愿军归国代表柴川若、董乐辅、窦少毅      
    向志愿军首长报告在华东区的工作情况敬爱的志愿军首长及全体同志们！
    我们于三月二十六日离开上海，先后到了南京、芜湖、扬州、泰州、南通、如皋、无锡、苏州、镇江、常州、丹阳、常熟、昆山、松江、杭州等城市，加上上海、济南二市，我们在华东地区两个月中，共参加欢迎大会作报告一百四十七次，听众二百三十二万七千六百人。另外，火车站上及沿途人民所组织的欢迎会与欢送会五十余次，连同夹道欢迎的人数，至少也有一百万人与我们见过面。平均起来每天有五、六万人欢迎我们和听我们的报告。
    我们在华东期间，大约有二分之一以上的时间是阴雨天，但是大会没有耽误一次。松江专区组织的大会，到了三万多人，其中有的农民冒着大雨跑了五十里路来参加。到会的人在雨中坚持三、四个钟头。南通六万余人冒雨夹道欢迎我们，从上午十二点钟一直站到下午六点半，所有的人衣服全部湿了，但是欢迎的队伍仍旧秩序井然。无锡各丝厂纱厂的女工们为了听我们的报告，就做夜工。她们做了一整夜的工，没有吃饭就来参加大会，在太阳下站了五个多钟头。她们个个都很兴奋，就像我们打了胜仗，由于兴奋而忘了疲劳一样。
    我们在北京的时候，中国人民抗美援朝总会彭真副主席曾指示我们要与群众见面。的确，与群众见面就是一件很大的工作。我们从南京坐火车到芜湖，五个多钟头，沿途的火车站上，都挤满了人，到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天。每个小站，我们都下去讲话了。当涂县东站，就集中了两万多人欢迎我们。在爆竹声中，人们把许多鲜花和礼物不断地塞进车厢，马鞍山的工人竟连矿苗也送了上来。在火车里，签名本子一堆一堆地送了过来，这些都是乘客和铁路员工的。我们离芜湖的那天，七万多人从半夜就起来欢送，队伍从江边摆到火车站上，足有十来里路长。在我们进了火车从车窗里向欢送的人们挥手告别的时候，忽然一群男女学生在站台上跳起来把我们的手和脸抱住狂吻。在火车开动以后，一群男女青年跟着火车跑了很长一段路。
    我们的住处，时常有很多青年学生花几个钟头的时间等着和我们握手或要我们签名，有时门口挤得断绝了交通。他们有的半夜就来，有的等到半夜不走。不知有多少人要求我们签名。这实在是一件繁重的工作。有时太多，实在签不完，有的机关、学校就把我们的签字制版付印。镇江市一个叫做聂影梅的青年给柴川若同志的信写着：“首先我该向您致谢，谢谢您今天给我的赐言：‘抗美援朝，保家卫国’。这八个字多么沉重的撞激了我的心。虽然这八个字对我已经不是陌生的了，但今天我更深深的体会到这八个字中间的联系是多么的密切。当我得到这久思难得的赐言后，禁不住跳了起来，我张开簿子给我的亲友们看，他们每人的眼睛里都流露出羡慕的眼光，谁都在说：‘看你运气多好。’同志！看！祖国的人民是多么的敬爱这代表着千万志愿军的代表。”
    我们在前方，一想到祖国的人民，身上就增加了力气，这次，亲眼看到祖国人民对我们志愿军的热爱，就更增加了我们的力气。华东的人民也普遍反映：“我们一想到志愿军，就浑身有劲，听了你们的报告，见了你们，就更加有劲。”华东和全中国的人民是决心支援我们志愿军去彻底战胜敌人的。我们从济南到杭州，到处听到人们喊着：“为了支援前线，巩固国防，我们一定作到要粮有粮，要钱有钱，要人有人！”我们在镇江看到光荣的妈妈黄亚兰，她把七个子女全部送出参加各种革命工作，她对我们说，你们都是好孩子。她并送给我们三个人每人一本大日记本子，上面写着：“为祖国的千千万万的儿女们的幸福而战斗吧！”南京大、中学生报名参军的达百分之三十八，其中有一位知识青年叫苏达生，为了报名参军，耐心说服他的父母五次，他从社会发展史一直讲到美国的金融寡头政治，又从中国革命的胜利讲到抗美援朝。最后他的父母完全同意他参加军事干部学校。他的父亲是中国银行副经理，他以后对人说：“现在我才相信‘志愿军’是完全名符其实的了。”
    我们在苏北，看到苏北人民战胜严重的灾荒，使我们感到人民力量之伟大。在苏南参观了土地改革展览会，使我们受了最好的教育。在杭州，参观了土特产展览会，有很多参加展览的工业品，已赶上与超过资本主义国家的水平，这说明祖国人民在解放以后正在以高度的积极性和创造性从事国家的建设，这使我们益加相信自己的力量，益加爱护自己的祖国。
    华东人民支援我们，还表现在慰劳救济方面。根据抗美援朝总会统计，目前全华东已送给总会五百余亿元。南京市有的黄包车工人，辛辛苦苦拉了一天黄包车，把所得的钱捐献出来。五台山一位小学教员，全家九口人，负担很重，他把每天三顿饭减为两顿，节省出三十斤粮食，全部捐献出来。杭州市一位姓汤的看门工人，他现在每月只赚到五万元，但他最近一次却捐献十万元，并且一定要我们亲自打收条。我们在华东亲手收到大批的礼物和慰问品，仅锦旗一项就有三千多面。有些锦旗上面，有好几千人签名。镇江市所献的锦旗中有一面上面缀满了世界民主青联的纪念章。慰问品的数量非常庞大。例如我们留苏州五天中，亲手收到的礼物就有锦旗二百四十三面，红领巾二十六条，慰问金二千七百六十多万元，书籍一万三千九百多册，慰问信四千九百多封，慰问袋一千六百多只，日记本、练习簿二千二百多本，毛巾一万九千多条，牙刷一千多把，铅笔二百二十三打，军鞋一千一百二十六双，肥皂两千多块，洋火三百五十多包，手表二只，自来水钢笔三十二枝，献词一千份，银盾二只，镜框四个，袜子一百多双，酒二百斤。此外还有子弹、风镜、板刷、颜料、图章、衬衫、古玩、食品、徽章等等。有些礼物，是珍藏了几十年以至几百年的，还有结婚证书上的彩带，以及许多珍贵的礼品。苏州抗美援朝分会为了保证把这些礼物送到前线，组织了十余个人专门保管、清查和登记。镇江市把慰劳品集中起来，布置成展览会，上千上万的人都去参观。
    我们看到浙江省和杭州市的人民正热烈进行着抗美援朝的各种工作。杭州的人民正在坚决镇压反革命活动，他们召开数万人的大会，控诉与公审反革命分子，举行“五一”大示威游行，召开全省劳动模范大会和全军区的战斗英雄大会，又在百忙中举行大会欢迎我们。在大小十五次的欢迎会中，有三十七万人与我们见了面。在抗美援朝的爱国运动中，据杭州、宁波、温州三个市及四十九个县统计，截至三月底止，共举行大小游行三百二十次，参加人数共五百三十七万零七百零五人。杭县有五万以上农民报名要求到朝鲜去参加志愿军。截至四月三十日止，全省人民捐献金额达一百八十八亿五千余万元，并有慰劳袋三千余只，药品一千五百件，其他物品十九万余件，另有新华书店代收书籍五万册。浙江省抗美援朝分会收到转发之慰问信三万余封。
    亲爱的首长和同志们！我们上面所报告的，仅仅是我们三个人离开上海之后的四十天中，在匆忙中所看到或听到的一点现象，但就是这些现象已经给我们很好的教育和鼓励。这些欢迎大会和实际行动都是给我们上的最好的政治课，都是华东人民在检阅自己的力量，向我们的敌人示威。它证明了一万万四千万华东人民正在全力支援我们，它有力地证明我们伟大祖国人民的空前团结与无比的强大。这更加提高与巩固了我们的胜利信心，使我们感到祖国人民的可爱，感到做一个毛泽东时代的中国人的光荣和骄傲。
    我们看到全华东人民都热爱祖国，热爱和平，热爱革命胜利的果实，他们像爱护自己的眼睛一样地爱护我们志愿军。不知有多少人向我们发问：“究竟你们需要什么？你们需要我们如何支援你们？你们看我们工作有什么缺点？”我们觉得，我们对人民的支援除了感谢而外，只有继续站在抗美援朝保家卫国的最前线，坚决打击侵略者，直到取得最后的胜利，才能对得起人民。我们觉得我们的胜利，是依靠着人民的支援而得来的。这种胜利是人民的胜利，这种光荣是人民的光荣。
    我们一定要在爱国主义的伟大旗帜下，为抗美援朝保家卫国的彻底胜利而奋斗！为我们伟大祖国不断的强大而奋斗！我们伟大的祖国万岁！毛主席万岁！
