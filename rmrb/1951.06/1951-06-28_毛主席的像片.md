　　Photograph of Chairman Mao
      Miao Chongsheng
    Zheng Haiyin, a soldier from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, told the following story of his personal experience, just one of countless similar incidents in Korea. Zheng Haiyin, wounded from the front lines, was resting at a local villager's home near the 38th parallel on his way back. After the meal, Zheng Haiyin took out a photograph of Chairman Mao from his pocket and pointed to it, saying to the old landlady, "This is our great Chinese people's leader, Comrade Mao Zedong – Chairman Mao." As soon as the Korean old lady heard it was Chairman Mao, she immediately took the photograph from the soldier's hand, looked at it carefully, then put it to her mouth and pressed it to her face, murmuring "Benefactor! Benefactor!". Then, she solemnly hung it on the wall and loudly called her husband, sons, and grandchildren to come and see.
    The old man in his fifties, his teenage son, and his five- or six-year-old granddaughter, hearing they were to see Chairman Mao, ran out of another room without even bothering to put on their shoes. The old man held the photograph of Chairman Mao in both hands, scrutinizing it for a long time, then raised it to his head to show his supreme respect. His son and granddaughter cheered in not-so-clear Chinese: "Long live Mao Zedong!" The neighboring villagers also ran over to see Chairman Mao; men, women, adults, and children crowded the room, and for a time the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" resounded through this Korean mountain village.

　　毛主席的像片
      苗重生
    我国人民志愿军某部战士郑海银讲了下面他亲身经历的一件事情，它不过是朝鲜无数类似事件中的一件。从前线负伤下来的郑海银途中休息在三八线附近某村的一个老乡家中。饭后，郑海银从衣袋里掏出来一张毛主席的像片，指给房东老太太说：“这就是我们伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志——毛主席。”这位朝鲜老太太一听说是毛主席，马上把像片从战士的手中拿过去，仔细地看了一遍，然后把像片放在嘴上，贴在脸上，喃喃地叨念着“恩人！恩人！”。然后，她很郑重地把它挂在墙上，大声地招呼她的丈夫，儿孙们来看。
    五十多岁的老汉，和他十几岁的儿子，五六岁的孙女，一听说看毛主席，鞋都没顾穿上，就从另一个屋子里跑出来了。这位老汉双手捧着毛主席的像片，端详了好一会，又顶在头上表示无上的敬意。他的儿子和孙女都用不大清晰的中国话欢呼着：“毛泽东万岁！”邻近的老乡们也都跑来看毛主席，男的、女的、大人、小孩挤满了一屋子，一时“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声响彻了这个朝鲜的山庄。
