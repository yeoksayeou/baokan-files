Responsible Person of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government
Answers Questions Regarding Locust Control

Q: Which regions are currently experiencing locust nymph infestations, and what is the situation?

A: Currently, seventy-eight counties in the provinces of northern Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Pingyuan, Henan, northern Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Xinjiang have reported significant locust nymph infestations. While local people's governments have organized farmers to eradicate most of these locust nymphs, the infestations continue to occur and develop due to seasonal factors. Some locust nymphs have already developed wings and are about to take flight. This is the most critical stage for locust nymph control. If we do not intensify our efforts to eradicate them completely, they will inevitably turn into winged locusts, wreaking havoc in vast areas of North China, East China, Central South China, and Northwest China. Therefore, concentrating all our strength to eradicate locust infestations is the most urgent task in agricultural production at present.

Q: What is the current situation regarding locust nymph control?

A: In the regions where locust nymphs have been discovered, the people's governments are leading the farmers, using the rich experience of organizing manpower to catch locusts from the old liberated areas, to make every effort to eradicate them. Currently, most regions have eradicated 70% to 80% of the locust nymphs. At the same time, the People's Air Force is actively assisting in the control efforts. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has repeatedly instructed all localities to adhere to the principle of "organizing manpower for capture as the main method, supplemented by pesticides and machinery," and resolutely implement the spirit of "attack early, attack small, attack thoroughly" to carry out capture efforts with all their strength, ensuring that locust nymphs are eliminated wherever they grow.

Q: What is the situation regarding the People's Air Force deploying aircraft to assist in locust control?

A: This year, the locust control work has received the assistance of the People's Air Force, for which the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the farmers across the nation are extremely excited and grateful. This is an unprecedented achievement in Chinese history and a direction for future locust control. The Central People's Government, established not long ago, is using such modern technology to assist agricultural production, which is only possible under the people's government. Since these aircraft started working, the Air Force personnel have gradually accumulated experience, and the results are becoming increasingly significant. However, under the current conditions, we cannot use aircraft for locust control on a large scale, and we can only mainly rely on organizing farmers to use manual methods for capture.

Q: What other issues should be paid attention to in locust control work?

A: The most important task is to fully mobilize the farmers to carry out manual capture. At present, aircraft locust control work can only be used on a trial basis in a few areas where the locust situation is particularly serious and manual capture is particularly difficult. Therefore, the people's governments at all levels must educate the farmers and must not have a mentality of relying on aircraft. All locust nymphs that have not grown wings must be eliminated quickly. After winged locusts appear, efforts must be made to eradicate them, and it is not acceptable to simply chase them away. At the same time, locust control intelligence work should be strengthened, joint prevention should be strictly organized, and when the movement of locust swarms is discovered, their flight direction should be reported step by step, village by village, district by district, and county by county, using the fastest methods, so as to prepare for capture. After the wheat harvest, scattered migratory locusts must be resolutely eradicated and should not be neglected. In areas where migratory locusts land, in addition to mobilizing the masses to carry out capture, egg collection and excavation should be carried out immediately in order to prevent the occurrence of autumn nymphs.

### 中央人民政府农业部负责人  答复有关灭治蝗虫问题

　　中央人民政府农业部负责人
    答复有关灭治蝗虫问题
    问：目前有那些地区发现蝗蝻，情形如何？
    答：目前有皖北、河北、山东、平原、河南、苏北、山西、新疆等省区的七十八个县内发现大量蝗蝻。其中大部分蝗蝻虽已由各地人民政府组织农民群众扑灭，但因季节关系，蝗害仍在继续发生与发展。部分蝗蝻并已生翅，即将起飞。目前正是防治蝗蝻的最紧急阶段，如不加紧扑打，彻底消灭，势必化为飞蝗，祸及华北、华东、中南和西北等区的广大地区。因此，集中一切力量火速扑灭蝗害，是目前农业生产中最急迫的任务。
    问：目前扑治蝗蝻的情形如何？
    答：已经发现蝗蝻的地区，人民政府正领导农民，运用老解放区过去组织人力捕打蝗虫的丰富经验，努力扑打。目前大部地区已扑灭蝗蝻百分之七十至八十。同时人民空军的飞机也正在积极协助灭治。中央人民政府农业部曾迭次指示各地掌握“以组织人力捕打为主，药械为辅”的原则，坚决贯彻“打早、打少、打了”的精神全力进行捕打，一定要做到蝗蝻生长在那里就消灭在那里。
    问：人民空军出动飞机协助治蝗的情形如何？
    答：今年灭治蝗虫的工作得到了人民空军的协助，中央人民政府农业部和全国农民群众对此极为兴奋和感谢。这是中国历史上的创举，也是将来治蝗的方向。中央人民政府建立不久，使用这样近代化的技术来协助农业生产，唯有人民的政府才有这种可能。这些飞机开始工作以来，空军人员已逐渐积累经验，效果日见显著。但是，在目前条件下，我们还不可能大量使用飞机灭蝗，而只能主要地依靠组织农民用人工方法扑打。
    问：治蝗工作中还要注意什么问题？
    答：最主要的工作是充分发动农民群众进行人力捕打。目前飞机灭蝗工作还只能在少数蝗情特别严重而人力捕打又特别困难的地区试用。因此各地人民政府必须教育农民，切不可存在依赖飞机的心理。凡未长翅膀的蝗蝻必须迅速消灭。飞蝗发生后，更须努力扑灭，不可赶跑了事。同时还应加强治蝗情报工作，严密组织联防，发现蝗群移动，应立即将其飞行方向，逐乡、逐区、逐县，用最迅速的方法次第传报，以便准备捕打。麦收后对散居型飞蝗，必须坚决扑灭，不可疏忽。凡飞蝗停落的地区，除发动群众进行捕打外，并须随即进行查卵掘卵，以期制止秋蝻发生。          （新华社）
