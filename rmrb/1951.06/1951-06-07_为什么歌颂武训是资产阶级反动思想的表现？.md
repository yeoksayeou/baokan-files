    What exactly are the errors in the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the numerous articles praising Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun"?
    The error of this film and these articles is that they have elevated a despicable, pitiful, and insignificant figure from the era when the Chinese feudal system began to collapse to the sacred altar. What exactly did Wu Xun do in his life that is worthy of praise? He was a beggar who kowtowed to anyone and everyone; he endured all kinds of humiliation and trampling, and found pleasure in being humiliated; he engaged in all kinds of inhuman behavior (such as eating snakes, scorpions, feces, and urine), turning himself into a clown in order to get "reward money"; he did the work of oxen and horses, and took pride in being able to replace the work of oxen and horses. Isn't all of this precisely the most prominent manifestation of the morality of a slave under feudal rule? In a class-exploitative society, poverty, humiliation, and being harmed are not inherently shameful. The working people generally live poor, humiliated, and harmed lives. But to become a beggar who begs from door to door because of poverty, and to be willing to be a beggar, happy to be a beggar, willing to be humiliated, and happy to be harmed, that is the most shameful. Wu Xun's shamefulness and despicableness are even worse than this, because he found a "noble" purpose for his base life, and that purpose was to run "free schools." He lent the money he obtained from begging to landlords and gentry at high interest rates, without spending a penny himself, "moved" landlords, gentry, bureaucrats, and even the "imperial court" to support and fund him. Thus, he finally established "free schools" presided over by "learned" people from the landlord and gentry class, allowing some children to have the "honor" of receiving education from the landlord class. Wu Xun used such behavior to show that a poor person, no matter how humiliated or harmed, no matter how debased a life they lead, must loyally defend the feudal ruling order and the moral ideology of the feudal rulers; and that being able to do so will earn the commendation of the ruling class.
    It is not surprising that such a Wu Xun was supported by the landlords and gentry of the time, rewarded by the autocratic dynasty, and later praised by the Northern Warlords and Chiang Kai-shek, and promoted by all feudalists. But why are there still many people who consider themselves to be standing on a "progressive" standpoint to understand Wu Xun, who are deeply impressed and praise this shameful and despicable beggar and slave? What is it that prevents them from seeing the essence of Wu Xun? What is it that makes them unable to avoid publicizing Wu Xun's "respectable and lovable" aspects, even when attempting to "criticize" Wu Xun? As the People's Daily editorial on May 20th has already clearly pointed out, this is mainly due to the reactionary bourgeois ideology playing tricks in people's minds.
    This article seeks to explain why it is precisely the reactionary bourgeois ideology that has caused people to fall into such serious errors when observing the role of Wu Xun.
            II
    Some authors of articles praising Wu Xun have said that their evaluation of Wu Xun is based on a historical viewpoint, while those who despise Wu Xun are proceeding from an anti-historical viewpoint. For example, Cheng Qinghua, who believes that Wu Xun possesses "the great spirit of self-sacrifice to serve the people," said: "We must understand a historical figure from the perspective of historical materialism. ... We cannot compare modern figures with historical figures to measure their importance." (Progress Daily, April 4th) Dong Weichuan also asserted that "the name Wu Xun should be said to be a banner of the great working people in Chinese history attempting to culturally emancipate their class," and said: "Any great figure and great deed in history, if measured and compared with today's revolutionary achievements, may be denied. But as long as a person or event can be called great in history, we should make a positive introduction from the spirit represented by that person, the process of completing that event, and the influence that the person and event had at the time, especially some advantages that should still be valued and promoted today. It does not seem that we should use today's standards to draw negative conclusions." (Guangming Daily, February 28th)
    Is it because we have adopted a crude method of measuring the ancients with "today's standards" that we have reached the conclusion of denying and despising Wu Xun?
    Marxists should not adopt this crude and erroneous method under any circumstances. As Lenin said: "The absolute requirement of Marxist theory is that in analyzing any social problem, the problem must be raised within a certain historical scope." (Selected Works of Lenin - Two Volumes, Moscow Chinese Edition - Volume I, page 723.) This "absolute requirement" must not be violated when analyzing any historical figure. This "absolute requirement" embodies the strict scientific attitude of Marxism towards history.
    Is the praise of Wu Xun instead a conclusion reached from a scientific analysis of history? In fact, not a single article praising Wu Xun specifically mentions the era in which Wu Xun lived. Cheng Qinghua, who claims to proceed from historical materialism, even seems unaware that Wu Xun was a person who died in the twenty-second year of Guangxu (1896). His article says: "Wu Xun grew up in the feudal society hundreds of years ago." All the authors of these articles are praising Wu Xun's "spirit represented" by him in a vacuum, detached from the specific historical background. They did not, as the People's Daily editorial said, "study what new socio-economic forms, new class forces, new figures, and new ideas have emerged in China in the more than one hundred years since the Opium War of 1840, struggling against the old socio-economic forms and their superstructure (politics, culture, etc.), and to determine what should be praised or extolled, what should not be praised or extolled, and what should be opposed."
    Wu Xun was born two years before the Opium War (1838) and died two years after the Sino-Japanese War (1896). This period was precisely the period when China rapidly fell into a semi-colonial status due to the invasion of capitalism-imperialism. The feudal social order was strongly shaken and rapidly began to disintegrate. The peasant revolution became the vanguard of welcoming the new era in history. It is said that Wu Xun began to have lofty ambitions for education at the age of nineteen (1857), which was seven years after the Jintian Uprising of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and three years after the capture of Nanjing as the capital. Although the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom failed in 1864, the "Nian Rebellion" and other peasant uprisings that followed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom continued until about 1870. The tide of peasant revolution propelled the death of the feudal order, and the Manchu Qing Dynasty could only survive with the support of foreign imperialism. Wu Xun established his first "free school" in 1887, three years after the Sino-French War. At that time, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was more afraid of the resurgence of peasant revolution than of foreign aggression. Kang Youwei described the situation at that time in his "Letter to the Emperor" in 1888 as: "Strong neighbors are forcing from the outside, and treacherous people are accumulating rebellion from the inside." He advised the emperor to implement "reform," otherwise, he warned: "The Jintian Uprising will rise again." In 1888, the Governor of Shandong summoned Wu Xun, and the Manchu Qing court broke the bureaucratic inertia and immediately issued an edict of commendation. The relationship with the situation at that time is very obvious.
    According to the historical situation at that time, it is very obvious that the feudal socio-economic form and its superstructure were old and dying things, and Wu Xun was a tiny slave belonging to the old things. It was the peasant revolution that resolutely rose up to fight against this old thing. The great power of the peasant revolution, which lasted for more than twenty years after 1850, prevented the foreign capitalist robbers from completely colonizing China. It shook the dark rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and enabled capitalist production methods to begin to grow on top of the dilapidated feudal system.
    When the great tide of peasant revolution passed, China began to have machine factories, shipping bureaus, telegraphs, trains, etc. But the process of modernization and industrialization was extremely slow and difficult. Neither the bourgeoisie nor the proletariat had yet formed. Only in the aristocratic intellectuals represented by Kang Youwei did the political demands of reformism with capitalist tendencies begin to be revealed. Kang Liang's "Hundred Days' Reform" occurred two years after Wu Xun's death.
    These aristocratic intellectual reformers hated the peasant revolutionary movement, which was one side of their reactionary nature, and this reactionary nature led them to later degenerate into royalists. However, during the Reform Movement period, their reformism still had a positive side. They attempted to carry out political reforms in the direction of the bourgeoisie in violation of the will of the stubborn feudal forces. Therefore, the feudal dynasty rewarded them not with an edict of commendation but with the death penalty.
    From this, it can be seen that, in terms of the specific historical situation, Wu Xun not only ran counter to the revolutionary ideas of the peasants at that time, but also could not be compared with the bourgeois reformism at that time. If it is said that Wu Xun's thinking was nothing more than the slavishness of being extremely loyal to feudalism, the unrepentant royalism.
    However, Wu Xun's eulogists put forward two points that are divorced from the specific historical environment and violate historical facts:
    The first point: Wu Xun was determined to "struggle" for the "cultural emancipation" of the people, so he is worthy of praise. To make such praises is actually to say that without touching the old socio-economic forms and old politics at all, it is possible to change the oppressed status of the people by carrying out cultural education among the people--and even without regard to the content of education.
    The second point: If Wu Xun did not achieve the goal of liberating the people, then his failure is the same as the failure of the peasant revolution at that time. Wu Xun's historical status is higher than the peasant revolution, or at least the same as the peasant revolution at that time.
    From what point of view does this view that people can "emancipate" themselves culturally without political struggle, and this view of obliterating and insulting the peasant revolution in order to elevate Wu Xun come from? --This is nothing else but the reactionary viewpoint of the bourgeoisie. Many people are precisely admiring and praising Wu Xun, a slave of feudalism, from the reactionary viewpoint of the bourgeoisie.
            III
    The film "The Life of Wu Xun" puts forward the idea of ​​using running free schools to "liberate" the people. The film uses images to tell people that poor people suffer because they are illiterate, and landlords can kill and seize because they have a pen in their hands. Therefore, Wu Xun's efforts are beneficial to the people, at least the "motives" are very kind. Dong Weichuan's article clearly stated: "If the working people want to emancipate themselves, they must go through education." In the film, Zhou Da, who participated in the armed struggle, said: "Okay, Wu Qi! You come with the pen, I come with the sword, let's use both, so that those dog officials and bullies know that our common people are not easy to bully!" (Sun Yu's movie novel: "The Life of Wu Xun", page 136.)
    This "one pen, one sword" view has been echoed by many commentators. The most clearly stated is the article by Chang Zhi published in Guangming Daily. He said: "The revolutionary significance of Wu Xun's running schools is the same as the revolutionary significance of the Taiping Army--both are for the emancipation of the laboring masses, but one focuses on revolutionary armed forces, and the other focuses on popularizing cultural education." Chang Zhi's article also said that the film "criticizes the limited nature of the revolutionary significance of Wu Xun's running schools, making people feel that only the combination of the two, plus correct leadership, can the revolution succeed, like China today." This means that "China today" is Wu Xun plus the Taiping Army plus "correct leadership." This author is so enthusiastically praising Wu Xun, obviously in order to explain that even in the revolution that created "China today," Wu Xun-style people have the same "revolutionary significance" as the masses of armed uprisings.
    First of all, putting "revolution" on Wu Xun is a fabrication. According to the true materials about Wu Xun, Wu Xun did not dream of changing the feudal ruling order and "liberating" the people by running schools. In fact, he was determined to run free schools in order to respect the feudal ruling order. The peasants who were oppressed under the feudal relationship would not have such a dream. Because peasants either dare not resist due to the conservatism formed by their long-term oppression, and attribute everything to "fate," or they "rise up" and rebel because they cannot bear the oppressed life. This kind of illusion that people can be liberated through cultural education cannot be produced from the cruel feudal ruling order. This illusion is added to Wu Xun by Wu Xun's eulogists, and is an illusion sung out in a "free" bourgeois tone.
    Secondly, this illusion added to Wu Xun by Wu Xun's eulogists is even more backward than the aristocratic intellectuals with bourgeois tendencies at that time. As we said earlier, Kang Youwei's reformist movement still had to touch the feudal ruling order, even if it was very little. Kang Youwei also put forward the proposal of popularizing education. He demanded the abolition of the imperial examination system and the opening of schools; he demanded that schools teach "astronomy, geography, mining, medicine, law, optics, mechanics, chemistry, electricity, machinery, military equipment, driving," etc. (see the third letter to the emperor in 1895). Of course, Kang Youwei did not advocate the fundamental overthrow of feudal education. He only advocated a reform in education in the direction of the bourgeoisie, which is consistent with his reformist proposals in politics. If this reform were implemented, the feudal ruling order would have to undergo some degree of change, which was unacceptable to the feudal ruling forces at that time. But what did Wu Xun do? He only ran free schools in the direction of landlords and bureaucrats, and the content of feudal education in his free schools did not change at all. Therefore, at that time, Kang Youwei's thinking still belonged to the category of the embryonic period of bourgeois revolutionary thought, although bourgeois revolutionary thought could only be expressed as very weak reformism in this aristocratic intellectual, while the popularization theory of cultural education expressed by borrowing Wu Xun completely belonged to the category of bourgeois reactionary thought.
    We should not look at "popularizing cultural education" abstractly. During the revolutionary struggle, it is valuable to publicize progressive cultural ideas in order to raise the awareness of the masses and promote political struggle. But to make progressive cultural education truly popular among the masses, it is impossible and therefore should not be imagined when the reactionary regime has not been overthrown. If the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the reactionary regime is not carried out, and "popularize cultural education," then it can only be the popularization of reactionary cultural education. The "cultural emancipation" of the people will inevitably follow the emancipation in politics and economics, and can never be a prerequisite for the change of the political and economic status of the people. During the revolutionary struggle, the significance of popularizing reactionary cultural education is to prevent the awakening of the masses and resist the revolutionary struggle, so it is reactionary and a surrender to the reactionary class.
    Didn't the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and some of Wu Xun's eulogists also point out Wu Xun's failure? But the problem is not whether it is possible to achieve the goal of liberating the people by popularizing cultural education. Because now, in fact, all the theories of saving the country through education in the old era of China have declared bankruptcy, and the liberation of the Chinese people has been victorious through the people's revolution. If you still don't know this at this time, then you are really dreaming in broad daylight. The problem is that this wish is inherently worthless, that is, it plays a role in restraining the people's hands and feet during the people's revolutionary period, that is, it is reactionary.
    In an article written in 1912, Lenin pointed out a reactionary bourgeois fantasy in Russia at that time:
        "The liberal utopia is the delusion that it is possible to achieve some serious reforms in Russia, in the area of ​​political freedom, and in the status of the working masses, by peaceful compromise, without offending anyone, without abolishing the Prishkevich generation, and without using a thorough and cruel class struggle. This is the utopia of believing that a free Russia can coexist peacefully with the Prishkevich generation." Lenin angrily criticized:
        "The bad thing about this utopia is obviously not only because it is a utopia, but also because it corrupts the democratic consciousness of the masses. The masses who believe in this utopia will never win freedom; such masses are not worthy of enjoying freedom; such masses should be mocked by the Prishkevich generation."
    Wu Xun, as a slave of feudalism, of course, cannot be said to have any bourgeois utopian ideas, but many of Wu Xun's eulogists used this bourgeois perspective to dress up Wu Xun and send him to the stage.
    We should also say that the bourgeois viewpoint expressed by praising Wu Xun is harmful not only because it is an illusion, but also because it corrupts the fighting consciousness of the masses. It tells the masses that in order to seek fundamental changes in the status of the working masses, they can peacefully compromise with the reactionary ruling forces, and even should kowtow to the reactionary forces. This method should not be spurned, but should be respected.
            IV
    The film's director and screenwriter also told us that the Chinese peasants' many struggles against the rulers-- "Whether Wu Xun's 'pen' or Zhou Da's 'sword'--without the correct leadership of the working-class party armed with Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to seize political power and win a permanent victory." (Sun Yu's movie novel: "The Life of Wu Xun", page 170.) The same view is also seen in Chang Zhi's article quoted above. According to this author, "Wu Xun" and the Taiping Army also have their "limitations."
    These views are used to elevate Wu Xun in the name of revolutionary peasants, and at the same time, they are used to insult the revolutionary peasants with the reactionary viewpoint of the bourgeoisie. According to this view, Wu Xun failed, but the Taiping Army also failed. Wu Xun had fantasies, but the Taiping Army also had fantasies. If it is said that Wu Xun was wrong, then the Taiping Army was also wrong.
    According to the description of Wu Xun's eulogists, what did Wu Xun do? He opened three schools to teach the three cardinal guides and five constant virtues to the landlord class. But what did the Taiping Army do in history? Although the Taiping Army and other peasant wars at that time ultimately failed, they played a major positive role in the key transformation of modern Chinese history, as we have already pointed out above. On what basis do people say that these two are fantasies of the same degree?
    Dai Baitao's article said: "Like Zhou Da, forming gangs to go up the mountains to kill landlords and bullies cannot save the suffering people, but like Wu Xun, wholeheartedly thinking that reading books will prevent people from being deceived and insulted is also a fantasy." (Quoted from the appendix of Sun Yu's "The Life of Wu Xun.") This statement is also wrong. We should not only use the word "fantasy" to lightly "criticize" Wu Xun, and at the same time, we cannot recognize the description in the movie, saying that the great peasant revolution is only "going up the mountains to kill landlords and bullies," and thinking that it and Wu Xun are the same kind of "fantasy."
    Are there any fantasy components in a great peasant war like the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom? Yes, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom fantasized about absolutely equally distributing the land in the world and realizing peasant socialism on the basis of a self-sufficient small agricultural economy. This is a fantasy. But this fantasy had a revolutionary effect in the historical period of mobilizing peasants to fight against landlords. And the peasants who were oppressed under the feudal system armed themselves and carried out an indomitable struggle to obtain land and freedom. There is no fantasy here, and there is nothing wrong. Is it that they should not rise up to carry out the anti-feudal struggle because they cannot have the leadership of the proletariat?
    If we think that we already have Marxism, and we already know that the Chinese revolution can only win victory and the working people can be completely liberated under the leadership of the proletariat, so we point fingers and say: Bourgeois reformism is a fantasy, and the peasant revolution is also a fantasy. They are all historical mistakes. If we do this, we are not scientific historians at all.
    We must understand how to analyze this kind of fantasy and that kind of fantasy according to the specific historical conditions.
    In the article "Two Utopias," Lenin made a strict distinction between liberal utopias and populist utopias. The former is the cowardly reformist fantasy of the bourgeoisie, and its role is to "corrupt revolutionary consciousness." The latter, "is the fantasy of the populist intellectuals and the labor faction's peasants, who believe that it is possible to eliminate the power and rule of capital and eliminate wage slavery by redistributing all the land according to the principle of fairness. ..." Lenin pointed out: Although this is also an unrealizable fantasy, because the current direct problem in Russia at that time was not proletarian reform, but bourgeois reform, "the populist utopia also plays a special historical role. Although this utopia is a fantasy about the economic results that the redistribution of land should have (and will have), it is also a companion and sign of the upsurge of the broad and great democratic movement of the peasant masses, ... and even to some extent a manifestation of this upsurge."
    Of course, the utopia that "corrupts democratic struggle" cannot be equated with the utopia that is a companion to the upsurge of democratic struggle. Can people not distinguish between cowardly fantasies and bold fantasies, and not distinguish between reactionary fantasies and revolutionary fantasies?
    The reactionary bourgeois reformists say to the people, do not struggle, but compromise and surrender, and liberation can be obtained from compromise and surrender.
    The revolutionary peasants without proletarian leadership say: Do not compromise and surrender, but fight resolutely, and from the struggle the peasants can reach a beautiful world like "heaven."
    Shouldn't these two kinds of "fantasies" be distinguished?
    The utopian ideal of agricultural socialism, transferred to the current Chinese social conditions, is reactionary, but in the 1850s and 1860s, the broad masses of peasants launched a thorough anti-feudal realistic struggle under this fantasy. Let's borrow Lenin's words again: "The 'equality' of land redistribution is a utopia, but in order to redistribute land, it is necessary to completely sever relations with all old, landlord, share, 'official,' etc. land ownership, which is the most needed, economically progressive, and most urgent method for Russia in the direction of bourgeois democracy."
    How should Marxists treat these two fantasies? We must resolutely point out the deception and reactionary nature of bourgeois reformism to the people, and at the same time, we must "carefully distinguish the sound, valuable, sincere and resolute fighting democratic kernel of the peasant masses" from the utopian form of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" (Lenin).
    The formula that the Chinese revolution can win victory by adding "Wu Xun" to "Zhou Da" and adding proletarian leadership is absurd. To regard "Wu Xun" and "Zhou Da" as equal, and even feel that Wu Xun is more worthy of praise, and Zhou Da is just a rude murderer, this view reveals a weak bourgeois viewpoint that comes from fear of the masses. Lenin criticized this viewpoint, which does not represent the revolutionary nature of the bourgeoisie, but its reactionary nature, so disgustingly: "The bourgeoisie is more afraid of mass movements than of reactionary forces. Therefore, the liberals show an amazing, almost incredible weakness in politics, and show complete powerlessness. Therefore, the liberals are extremely ambiguous, extremely lying, extremely hypocritical, and use cowardly evasive means in all their policies, because they must play the tricks of democracy in order to attract the masses to their side, but at the same time they are extremely opposed to democracy, extremely hostile to mass movements, hostile to their pioneering spirit, and hostile to their 'skyrocketing' spirit."
            V
    The reactionary reformism of the bourgeoisie has a relatively long history in China.
    Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao in the Reform Movement of 1898 had a certain progressive significance at that time, but in the blink of an eye, when the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolutionary movement headed by Sun Yat-sen rose up, this group of aristocratic intellectuals rose up against the revolution as constitutional monarchists. Liang Qichao once declared when opposing the revolutionary Tongmenghui that he also advocated "political revolution," but what he advocated was a legitimate political revolution. His slogan was "Those who want to carry out political revolution should demand rather than riot." And "The demand must be measured by what they (the Manchu Qing rulers) can give me, and then the demand is not false." (See Liang's "On Enlightened Despotism", Chapter 8.) --This means that the people can only make "demands" to the rulers, and should not struggle, and must also make demands within the scope that the rulers can give. This reformist, who had already degenerated to the royalist position, actually called such a proposal "political revolution." What is worth noting here is that this Liang Qichao also wrote articles praising Wu Xun. Wu Xun, who begged the landlords and gentry for free schools, was of course a completely harmless and very "legitimate" "revolutionary" in Liang Qichao's view.
    Because the Chinese bourgeoisie was in a damaged position under the reactionary rule and had never obtained political power, it often harbored dissatisfaction with the status quo; but at the same time, because the bourgeoisie had great weakness, "lacked sufficient courage, and many people were afraid of the people" ("On People's Democratic Dictatorship"), it did not dare to take a positive attitude towards the revolution. In this situation, it is natural to easily grow the reformist thought of compromising and even surrendering to the rulers. This kind of thought was expressed in the form of saving the country through industry and saving the country through education during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They fantasized that they could achieve the goal of saving the country by developing industry, popularizing education, and other "legitimate" methods without carrying out sharp struggles with the reactionary ruling forces and the imperialists. This fantasy actually played a reactionary role in assisting the reactionary forces and corrupting the democratic struggle during the continuous upsurge of the people's revolutionary movement under the leadership of the proletariat. Chairman Mao said in "The Current Situation and Our Tasks":
        "Among the upper petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie in the areas ruled by Chiang Kai-shek, there is a small number of people, that is, the right-wing elements of these classes, who have reactionary political tendencies. They spread illusions for the American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary political groups. They oppose the people's democratic revolution. When their reactionary tendencies can still influence the masses, we should carry out exposure work to the masses who accept their influence, attack their political influence among the masses, and liberate the masses from their influence."
    The promotion and praise of Wu Xun has been almost continuous for many years. A part of it is directly issued by the reactionary ruling forces (the reactionary ruling forces of course want to praise such a loyal and docile slave), and a large part is more or less related to this bourgeois reactionary reformist thought.
    The victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution has thoroughly bankrupted this reactionary reformist thought. But this does not mean that we should not be vigilant against the influence of this thought. Since the constitutional monarchist Liang Qichao could call himself a political revolutionary at that time, it is not surprising that the bourgeois reformist thought now disguises itself as "serving the people," "historical materialism," "proletarian revolution," "Marxism-Leninism," and so on. The victory of the revolution on the one hand shows that the people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism has achieved great results; while on the other hand, it must never be forgotten that the struggle against all these internal and external enemies must continue to develop more sharply under the situation of the people obtaining political power. The struggle against foreign imperialism and against the domestic reactionary classes that have been overthrown has not ended, but is going on every day. If we think that the struggle has ended, so there is no need to be vigilant against all kinds of reactionary thoughts that are disguised and enough to corrupt the people's fighting spirit, then we are first captured by the enemy in spirit. Marxists-Leninists must not only eliminate the thoughts of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, but also expose the harm of this thought to the masses when the reactionary thought of the bourgeoisie can still influence the masses, so that the masses can get rid of this influence and resolutely and bravely meet new struggles. We must use the thought of the people's democratic revolution to criticize and attack the bourgeois reformist thought, and we must never allow these two thoughts to be mixed up.
    For this reason, the emergence of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the fact that it won a lot of applause during its public performance are worthy of serious attention. Also for this reason, the People's Daily issued a timely warning based on the fact that some communists lost their ability to criticize in front of Wu Xun and the movie "The Life of Wu Xun": "Isn't it a fact that the bourgeois reactionary thought has invaded the fighting Communist Party? Where has the Marxism that some communists claim to have learned gone?"

　　为什么歌颂武训是资产阶级反动思想的表现？
    胡绳
            一
    电影《武训传》和许多歌颂武训这个人和《武训传》这个电影的文章究竟有些什么错误呢？
    这个电影和这些文章的错误是，它们把在中国封建制度开始崩溃时代的一个可卑可耻的渺不足道的小人物，捧到了神圣的殿坛上去。武训这个人一生所作所为究竟有什么值得歌颂的呢？他是一个乞丐，向任何人磕头求乞；他忍受各种屈辱和践踏，并以受辱为愉快；他干各种非人的行为（例如吃蛇蝎粪尿），把自己装成小丑，为了得到“赏钱”；他做牛马做的工作，并以自己能代替牛马的工作而洋洋得意。这一切难道不正是封建统治下的奴才道德的极端突出的表现么？在阶级剥削社会中，贫穷、受侮辱、受损害，并不就是可耻的。劳动人民一般地过着穷苦的、被侮辱和被损害的生活。但因为贫穷而流为沿门托钵的乞丐，而且甘于为乞丐，乐于为乞丐，甘于被侮辱，乐于被损害，这才是最可耻的。武训的可耻可卑，甚至还更甚于此，因为他给他的卑污的生活找出了一个“高尚”的目的，这目的就是办“义学”。他把行乞得来的钱通过地主绅士放高利贷，自己一个钱不花，“感动”了地主、绅士、官僚、以至“朝廷”，支持他，资助他，于是终于办成了由地主绅士阶级中的“有学问”的人所主持的“义学”，使得有一些儿童有“荣幸”受地主阶级的教育。武训用这样的行为来表示：一个穷苦的人，无论怎样受侮辱，受损害，无论过怎样下贱的生活，都要忠心耿耿地保卫封建统治秩序，保卫封建统治者的道德思想；而能够这样做，就能够得到统治阶级的嘉奖。
    这样一个武训，在当时受到地主绅士的赞助，受到专制皇朝的奖励，后来又为北洋军阀和蒋介石所表扬，并为一切封建主义者所推崇，那是不足为奇的。但为什么至今还会有许多自以为站在“进步”立场来认识武训的人，十分倾倒地歌颂这个可耻可卑的乞丐和奴才呢？是什么东西障碍他们看出武训的实质呢？是什么东西使他们甚至在企图“批判”武训的时候，还是舍不得不宣扬武训的“可敬可爱”之处呢？如同《人民日报》五月二十日社论所已经明白指出的，这主要是由于资产阶级的反动思想在人们头脑里作怪的原故。
    在这篇文章里想要说明，为什么正是资产阶级反动思想，使得人们在观察武训这个角色的时候，陷入了如此严重的错误。
            二
    曾有一些歌颂武训的文章的作者说，他们对武训的估价是历史主义的看法，而蔑视武训则是出发于反历史主义的观点。例如，认为武训具有“自我牺牲为人民服务的伟大精神”的程庆华说：“我们认识一个历史人物必须从历史唯物主义的观点出发。……不能拿现代的人物与历史上的人物比较，来衡量他们的轻重。”（《进步日报》四月四日）又如董渭川断定“武训这个名字应该说是中国历史上伟大的劳动人民企图使本阶级从文化上翻身的一面旗帜”，并且说：“历史上的任何一个伟大人物和伟大事迹，如果拿今天的革命成就来比较衡量，恐怕都有被否定的可能，但是只要在历史上称得起伟大的人和事，我们就应该从那个人代表的精神和那件事完成的过程，以及人和事在当时所发生的影响，特别是在今天还应该重视和发扬的某些优点，作肯定的介绍，似乎不应该用今天的尺度作否定的结论。”（《光明日报》二月二十八日）
    我们得到否定和蔑视武训的结论，究竟是不是因为我们采取了一种拿“现在的尺度”衡量古人的粗鲁办法呢？
    马克思主义者在任何情况下都不应该采取这种粗鲁的、错误的办法。如同列宁所说的：“马克思主义理论的绝对要求，就是在分析任何一个社会问题时，要把问题提到一定的历史范围之内。”（列宁文选——两卷集，莫斯科中文版——第一卷，七二三页。）在分析任何一个历史人物时，也不能违反这“绝对的要求”。在这“绝对的要求”中，表现着马克思主义对待历史的严格的科学态度。
    难道对武训的歌颂反而是从科学地分析历史而达到的结论么？事实上没有一篇歌颂武训的文章，具体地说到了武训所处的时代。宣称要从历史唯物主义出发的程庆华甚至似乎不知道武训是死于光绪二十二年（一八九六年）的一个人，他的文章中说：“武训生长在数百年前的封建社会里。”所有这些文章的作者都是脱离了具体的历史背景而在空洞地歌颂着武训这个人“所代表的精神”。他们并没有，如同《人民日报》的社论所说的，“去研究自从一八四○年鸦片战争以来的一百多年中，中国发生了一些什么向着旧的社会经济形态及其上层建筑（政治、文化等等）作斗争的新的社会经济形态、新的阶级力量、新的人物和新的思想，而去决定什么东西是应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是不应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是应当反对的”。
    武训生在鸦片战争前二年（一八三八年），死于中日战争后二年（一八九六年）。这个时期正是中国因受资本主义——帝国主义的侵略而急速地降入半殖民地地位的时期。封建社会秩序受到强烈的震动，迅速地开始分解。农民大革命成为迎接历史新时代的先锋。据说武训在十九岁（一八五七年）开始有兴学大志，那是在太平天国金田起义后七年，占领南京为首都后三年。太平天国虽然在一八六四年失败了，但继太平天国之后的“捻党”和其他农民起义一直继续到一八七○年左右。农民大革命的浪潮催送封建秩序的死亡，满清皇朝靠外国帝国主义的支持才能苟延残喘。武训办成他的第一个“义学”是在一八八七年，中法战争后三年。其时，满清皇朝害怕农民革命的再起更甚于害怕外国的侵略。康有为在一八八八年“上皇帝书”中描写当时的情势是：“强邻四逼于外，奸民蓄乱于内”。他劝告皇帝实行“变法”，否则，他警告说：“金田之役将复起矣”。就在一八八八年，山东巡抚召见武训，满清朝廷打破官僚主义的因循惯性，立即传令嘉奖，这和当时的情势的关系是很显然的。
    根据当时的历史情况来看，很明显的，封建的社会经济形态及其上层建筑是旧的、正在死亡着的事物，武训正是属于旧事物的一个渺小的奴才。坚决地起来和这种旧的事物进行斗争的是农民革命。从一八五○年后绵延二十多年之久的农民革命的伟大力量阻止了外国资本主义强盗完全殖民地化中国的企图。把满清的黑暗统治打得摇摇欲坠，并且使资本主义生产方法得以在残败的封建制度之上开始生长出来。
    在农民革命的大浪潮过去时，中国开始出现机器工厂、轮船局和电报、火车等。但是近代化的工业的发生过程是异常缓慢而困难的。资产阶级和无产阶级都还没有形成。仅仅在以康有为为代表的贵族知识分子身上，开始透露了资本主义倾向的改良主义政治要求。康梁的“百日维新”是在武训死后二年发生的。
    这些贵族知识分子的改良主义者们仇视农民革命运动，这是他们的反动性的一面，这种反动性使他们后来堕落为保皇主义。但是在维新运动时期，他们的改良主义还有其积极性的一面。他们违反顽固的封建势力的意志而企图按资产阶级方向进行政治改革，因此封建王朝报答他们的不是传令嘉奖而是判处死刑。
    由此可见，就具体的历史情况来看，武训不但和当时的农民的革命主义背道而驰，而且也不能和当时的资产阶级性的改良主义相提并论。如果说武训的思想，那不过是极端地忠于封建主义的奴才主义，至死不悟的保皇主义。
    但武训的歌颂者提出了两个脱离了具体历史环境和违反历史事实的论点：
    第一个论点：武训是立意为人民的“文化翻身”而“奋斗”的，所以值得歌颂。做这样的歌颂，实际上就是说，完全不触动旧的社会经济形态，旧的政治，只要在人民中进行文化教育——甚至也完全不管教育的内容，就可以改变人民的被压迫的地位。
    第二个论点：如果说，武训并没有实现解放人民的目的，那么他的失败也正如当时的农民革命的失败一样。武训的历史地位高过农民革命，至少和当时的农民革命是同样的。
    这种认为离开政治斗争，人民可以在文化上“翻身”的看法，这种为提高武训而抹煞和侮蔑农民革命的看法，是从什么观点而来的呢？——这不是别的，就是资产阶级的反动观点。有许多人正是从资产阶级的反动观点出发而欣赏和赞美武训这个封建主义的奴才。
            三
    电影《武训传》提出了用办义学来“解放”人民的思想。电影中用形象告诉人，穷人因为不识字所以才吃亏，地主因为有笔在手就可以生杀予夺，所以武训的努力是造福于人民的，至少是“动机”十分善良的。董渭川的文章鲜明地说：“劳动人民要想翻身，必须透过教育。”电影中借参加武装斗争的周大说：“好，武七！你来文的，我来武的，咱们一文一武，让那些狗官恶霸知道，咱们老百姓不是好欺负的！”（孙瑜著电影小说：《武训传》，一三六页。）
    这种“一文一武”的看法，得到不少评论者的附和。说得最明白的是发表在《光明日报》上的长之的文章。他说：“武训兴学之革命的意义，是和太平军那样的革命的意义，有某种相同处——都为了劳苦大众翻身，不过一重在革命武装，一重在普及文化教育而已。”长之的文章又说，电影中是“批判了武训兴学的革命意义之限制性，让人觉得只有二者合起来，再加上正确的领导，革命才可以成功，像中国今天这样子”。这就是说，“中国今天这样子”就是武训加太平军加“正确的领导”。这位作者如此热心地表扬武训，显然正是为了想说明，甚至在造成“中国今天这样子”的革命中，武训式的人也是和武装起义的群众有同样的“革命意义”的。
    首先，把“革命”企图摆在武训身上，是一种捏造。根据关于武训的真实的材料，武训并没有梦想过由办学来改变封建统治秩序而“解放”人民，他其实是为了尊重封建统治秩序，所以才立志办义学。在封建关系下被压迫的农民也不会发生这种梦想。因为农民或者由于其长期被压迫而形成的保守性不敢进行反抗，把一切归于“命运”，或者由于忍受不住被压迫生活“揭竿而起”，造反。从残酷的封建统治秩序中不能产生这种靠文化教育就能解放人民的幻想。这种幻想是武训的歌颂者加到武训身上去的，是用一种“自由”资产阶级的调子唱出来的幻想。
    其次，武训歌颂者所加于武训身上的这种幻想甚至还落后于当时的具有资产阶级倾向的贵族知识分子。如我们前面所说，康有为的改良主义运动究竟还是要去触动封建统治秩序，那怕是很少的触动。康有为也提出普及教育的主张，他要求废科举，开学校；他要求学校中教授“天文地矿医律光重化电机器武备驾驶”等等（见一八九五年上皇帝第三书）。当然，康有为并没有主张根本推翻封建教育。他只是主张按资产阶级的方向在教育上进行一种改良，这和他在政治上的改良主张是相适应的。如果实行这种改良，封建统治秩序就不能不发生某种程度的变动，这是当时的封建统治势力所不能接受的。但是武训怎样做的呢？他只是按照地主官僚的方向而办义学，在他的义学中，封建教育的内容分毫也没有改变。所以在当时康有为的思想还是属于资产阶级革命萌芽时期的思想的范畴，尽管资产阶级革命思想在这个贵族知识分子身上只能表现为十分软弱的改良主义，而借用武训来表现的这种文化教育普及论却完全是属于资产阶级反动思想的范畴的。
    不应该抽象地看“普及文化教育”。在革命斗争时期，宣传进步的文化思想，以提高群众觉悟，推动政治斗争，是有价值的。但要使进步的文化教育真正在人民大众中普及，当反动政权没有推翻时，是不可能的，因此也是不应该去设想的。如果不进行推翻反动政权的革命斗争，而去“普及文化教育”，那就只能是普及反动的文化教育。人民的“文化翻身”，必然追随在政治和经济上的翻身而来，绝不能是人民的政治地位和经济地位的变革前提。在革命斗争时期，普及反动的文化教育，其意义就是阻止群众的觉悟，抵抗革命斗争，所以是反动的，是向反动阶级的投降。
    电影《武训传》和有些武训的歌颂者不也是指出了武训的失败么？但问题并不是，用普及文化教育来解放人民究竟能否实现。因为现在，事实上，中国旧时代中的一切教育救国论都已经宣告破产，中国人民的解放已经通过人民大革命而胜利，到这时候，如果还不知道这一点，那真是白昼做梦了。问题是在，这种愿望本来就是毫无价值的，就是在人民的革命时期起束缚人民的手脚的作用的，就是反动的。
    列宁在一九一二年所写的《两种乌托邦》（列宁文选——两卷集，莫斯科中文版——第一卷，八一二至八一六页。“乌托邦是个没有的地方，是一种空想，虚构和幻想”，列宁文章中这样解释。以后所引的列宁的话均见这篇论文。）一文中指出俄国当时有一种资产阶级的反动幻想：
        “自由主义的乌托邦，就是妄想用和平妥协的办法，不必得罪任何人
    ，不必撤消普里什克维奇辈，不必用彻底的残酷阶级斗争，而就能在俄国
    ，在俄国政治自由方面，在劳动民众地位方面，达到某些严重的改良。这
    是妄想自由俄国能与普里什克维奇辈和平共处的乌托邦。”列宁又愤怒地批评说：
        “这种乌托邦的坏处，显然不仅由于它是乌托邦，而且由于它败坏群
    众的民主意识。相信这种乌托邦的群众，永远也不会争得自由；这样的群
    众不配享受自由；这样的群众完全应该遭受普里什克维奇辈戏弄。”
    武训这个人，不过是一个封建主义的奴才，当然说不上有什么资产阶级的乌托邦思想，但许多武训的歌颂者正是用这种资产阶级的观点来打扮了武训，把他送到了舞台上面。
    我们同样应该说，由歌颂武训而表现出来的资产阶级观点之所以是有害的，还不仅因为这是一种幻想，而且因为它败坏群众的斗争意识，它告诉群众，为了求得劳动群众的地位的根本改变，可以和反动统治势力和平妥协，甚至还应该向反动势力卑躬屈膝，采取这种办法是不应该受唾弃的，反而是应该受尊敬的。
            四
    电影的编导者又告诉我们，中国农民对统治者的多次斗争——“无论武训的‘文’或周大的‘武’——没有马列主义思想武装的工人阶级政党的正确领导，是无法夺得政权，获得永久的胜利的。”（孙瑜著电影小说：《武训传》，一七○页。）同样的看法也见于上引的长之的文章中。据这位作者看来，“武训”和太平军同样有其“限制性”。
    这些看法都是借革命农民的名义来抬高武训，同时也是用资产阶级反动观点来侮蔑革命的农民。按照这种看法，武训是失败了，但太平军也是失败了，武训有的是幻想，但太平军有的也是幻想，如果说武训是错误的，那么太平军也同样是错误的。
    照武训的歌颂者的描写，武训究竟做成了些什么事呢？开了三个为地主阶级教授三纲五常的学校。但在历史上，太平军做了些什么事呢？太平军和当时的其他农民战争固然最后都是失败了，但是在中国近代历史的转变关键中起了重大的积极作用，如我们在前面所已经指出的。人们究竟根据什么来说这二者是同等程度的幻想呢？
    戴白韬的文章说：“像周大那样的结伙上山的痛杀地主恶霸，既不能解救苦难的人民，但像武训一心以为读了书就不会被人欺骗侮辱也是幻想”。（引自孙瑜著《武训传》的附录。）这说法也是错误的，我们不应该只用“幻想”二字来轻描淡写地“批评”武训，同时也不能承认电影中的描写，把伟大的农民革命说成仅仅是“上山痛杀地主恶霸”，并且以为它和武训是同类的“幻想”。
    在像太平天国这样伟大的农民战争中有没有幻想的成份呢？有的，太平天国幻想把天下的田绝对平均地分配，在自给自足的小农业经济基础上实现农民的社会主义。这是幻想。但是这种幻想在动员农民与地主作斗争的历史时期中是有革命作用的。而在封建制度下被压迫的农民，武装起来，为取得土地和自由而进行至死不屈的斗争，这里一点也不是幻想，更没有什么错误。难道因为他们不可能有无产阶级的领导，就不应该起来进行反封建的斗争么？
    如果我们自以为已经有了马克思主义，已经知道只有在无产阶级领导下中国革命才能取得胜利，劳动人民才能彻底解放，所以我们就指指点点地说：资产阶级改良主义是幻想，农民的革命也是幻想，它们都不过是历史的错误而已。如果我们这样做，我们就一点也不是科学的历史主义者。
    我们必须懂得根据历史的具体条件分析这一种幻想和那一种幻想。
    列宁在《两个乌托邦》一文中，对于自由主义的乌托邦和民粹主义的乌托邦作了严格的区别。前者是资产阶级的怯懦的改良主义幻想，其作用是“败坏革命意识”。后者呢，“是民粹派的知识分子和劳动派的农民所抱的幻想，他们以为可能用公平原则重新分配全部土地的办法来消除资本的权力和统治，消除雇庸奴隶制。……”列宁指出：这虽然也是不能实现的幻想，但是，因为当时的俄国的当前直接问题还不是无产阶级性的改革，而是资产阶级性的改革，所以“民粹派的乌托邦也就起着一种特殊的历史作用。这种乌托邦虽然对于重分土地应有（和将有）何种经济结果的问题是一种幻想，但它同时又是农民群众广阔伟大民主运动高涨的伴侣和征候，……在某种程度上甚至是这种高涨的表现”。
    当然不能把“败坏民主斗争”的乌托邦和作为民主斗争的高涨的伴侣的乌托邦一律看待。人们难道可以不区别怯懦的幻想和大胆的幻想，不区别反动的幻想和革命的幻想么？
    资产阶级的反动的改良主义者向人民说，不要斗争，而要妥协、投降，从妥协、投降中可以得到解放。
    没有无产阶级领导的革命农民说：不要妥协、投降，而要坚决斗争，从斗争中农民可以达到“天国”一样美好的世界。
    难道这两种“幻想”不应该区别开来么？
    农业社会主义的空想，移在现在的中国社会条件中来，是有反动性的，但是十九世纪五十年代六十年代，广大农民群众正是在这种幻想下发动了彻底反封建的现实的斗争。还是借用列宁的话吧：“土地重分的‘平均性’是乌托邦，但是为了重分土地而必须实行与一切旧的、地主的、份地的、‘官家的’等等土地所有制完全断绝关系，却是在资产阶级民主主义方向上最需要的，经济上进步的，对于俄国的这样的国家最为迫切的办法。”
    马克思主义者如何对待这两种幻想呢？要坚决地向人民指出资产阶级改良主义的欺骗性和反动性，同时要从“太平天国”的这种空想的形式中间“把农民群众的健全宝贵的、诚恳坚决的战斗民主主义的内核细心分辨出来”（列宁）。
    所谓“武训”加“周大”加无产阶级领导，中国革命就得到胜利的公式是荒谬的。把“武训”和“周大”看成是并驾齐驱的，甚至觉得武训是更值得歌颂的，而周大不过是粗鲁的杀人犯，这种看法正是透露了一种由于害怕群众而来的软弱的资产阶级观点，对于这种不是代表资产阶级的革命性，而是代表其反动性的观点，列宁曾如此嫌恶地批评说：“资产阶级害怕群众运动，比害怕反动势力还要厉害。因此，自由派在政治上就表现出一种惊人的，简直是不可思议的软弱性，就表现出完全无力。因此，自由派在其全部政策上都极其模棱两可，极端撒谎，绝顶虚伪，运用怯懦的支吾手段，因为他们定要玩弄民主主义的把戏，以便把群众吸引到自己方面来，而同时他们又极端反对民主主义，极端仇视群众运动，仇视其首创发起精神，仇视其‘冲天’精神。”
            五
    资产阶级的反动性的改良主义，在中国已有相当长久的历史。
    戊戌维新运动中的康有为，梁启超在当时是有其一定的进步意义的，但是一转眼间，当以孙中山为首的资产阶级、小资产阶级革命运动兴起时，这批贵族知识分子就以君主立宪派的身份起来反对革命了。梁启超在反对革命的同盟会时曾宣称，他也是主张“政治革命”的，不过他所主张的是，正当的政治革命，他的口号是“欲为政治革命者宜以要求而勿以暴动”。而且“要索必当量彼（满清统治者）所能以予我者，夫然后所要索为不虚”。（见梁著《开明专制论》第八章）——这是说，人民只能向统治者提出“要求”，不应斗争，而且还必须在统治者所可能给的范围内提出要求。这个已经堕落到保皇党立场的改良主义者居然把这样的主张叫做“政治革命”。值得我们在这里注意的是，就是这个梁启超也曾写了文章歌颂武训。向地主绅士乞求义学的武训，按梁启超的观点看来，当然是一个毫无危险性的十分“正当”的“革命”家。
    中国资产阶级因为在反动统治下处于被损害的地位，从未得到过政权，所以常常怀着对于现状的不满；但同时资产阶级又因为具有极大的软弱性，“缺乏足够的勇气，并且有不少人害怕民众”（《论人民民主专政》），所以不敢对于革命采取积极的态度。在这样的情形下，就自然容易生长向统治者妥协甚至投降的改良主义思想。这种思想，在国民党反动派统治时期，曾表现为工业救国论。教育救国论等等形式。他们妄想不去和反动统治势力和帝国主义者进行尖锐的斗争，就能用发展工业，普及教育等“正当”的方法达到救国的目的。这种妄想，在无产阶级领导的人民革命运动不断高涨的期间，实际上起着援助反动势力，败坏民主斗争的反动作用。毛主席在《目前形势和我们的任务》中说：
        “蒋介石统治区域的上层小资产阶级及中等资产阶级，其中有为数不
    多的一部分人，即这些阶级的右翼分子，存在着反动的政治倾向，他们替
    美国帝国主义与蒋介石反动的政治集团散布幻想，他们反对人民民主革命
    ，当着他们的反动倾向尚能影响群众时，我们应当向着接受他们影响的群
    众进行揭露工作，打击他们在群众中的政治影响，使群众从他们影响之下
    解放出来。”
    对武训的宣扬与歌颂，多少年来，几乎络绎不绝。其中有一部分是直接从反动统治势力发出的（反动统治势力当然要表扬这样的忠驯的奴才），还有很大一部分却是多多少少和这种资产阶级性的反动的改良主义思想相联系着的。
    中国人民大革命的胜利使这种反动的改良主义思想彻底破产了。但并不能因此就不去警惕这种思想的影响。既然君主立宪派梁启超在那时候可以自称为政治革命主义者，那么资产阶级改良主义思想现在化装为“为人民服务”论，“历史唯物论”，“无产阶级革命论”，“马列主义”等等，也是不足为怪的。革命的胜利一方面表示人民对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的革命斗争已经取得巨大的成果；而另一方面，绝对不应该忘记的是，对这一切内外敌人的斗争还要在人民取得政权的形势下面更尖锐地发展下去。对国外的帝国主义，对国内已被打倒的反动阶级的斗争并没有终止，而是没有一天不在进行。如果我们以为斗争已经终了，因此就不必去警惕各种化装起来的足以败坏人民的斗志的反动思想，那么我们就是首先在精神上被敌人所俘虏了。马克思列宁主义者不仅要肃清帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的思想，而且还要在资产阶级的反动思想尚能影响群众时，向群众揭露这种思想的危害，好使群众摆脱这种影响而坚决地勇敢地迎接新的斗争。必须用人民民主革命的思想来批评和打击资产阶级改良主义思想，而决不容许把这两种思想混同起来。
    就因为这个原故，《武训传》的出现及其在公演期间曾博得一片采声的事实，值得严重注意。也就因为这个原故，《人民日报》根据有一些共产党员在武训这个人和《武训传》这个电影面前丧失了批判能力的事实提出了适时的警告：“资产阶级反动思想侵入了战斗的共产党，这难道不是事实吗？一些共产党员自称已经学得的马克思主义，究竟跑到什么地方去了呢？”
