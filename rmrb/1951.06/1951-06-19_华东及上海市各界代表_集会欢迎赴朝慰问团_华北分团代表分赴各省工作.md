Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. More than 12,000 representatives from all walks of life in East China and Shanghai gathered on the 16th to welcome the Second and Third Sub-delegations of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea and the China Acrobatic Troupe. Liu Changsheng, chairman of the meeting, delivered a welcome speech, saying: "The arrival of the delegation will surely deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea in East China and Shanghai. The people of East China and Shanghai must contribute their strength and wisdom to donate a large number of planes and artillery by increasing production and increasing income, and more effectively support the front." At the meeting, Deputy Head of the Delegation Chen Yi, Head of the Third Sub-delegation Chen Sisheng, Deputy Head of the Second Sub-delegation Chen Bo, and representatives of the directly affiliated sub-delegation Lei Jieqiong, Zhao Guoyou, and Ling Qijun all gave reports. In his report, Chen Sisheng especially called on the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai to actively donate planes and artillery to support the front and strive for the first place in the national donation movement.
Their reports were repeatedly interrupted by applause and cheers.

This newspaper reports: Fifty-seven representatives of the North China Sub-delegation of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea departed for the five provinces of North China on the 13th to report to the people in various places on their visits to Korea and the heroic deeds of the Chinese and Korean people's forces in bravely striking at the US aggressors, and to cooperate with the anti-US and Aid Korea sub-associations in various places to mobilize the 70 million people of North China to respond to the call of the National Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, vigorously promote patriotic pacts, donate planes and artillery, and give preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel in the three major patriotic movements. In order to make this work widespread and in-depth, the original 32 representatives from the North China level and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin also went to the five provinces of North China to assist the representatives of various provinces. The areas where they work are the directly subordinate cities, key industrial and mining areas, and key old revolutionary base areas in the provinces, such as Fuping and Pingshan in Hebei Province, Wuxiang and Zuoquan in Shanxi Province, and Puyang in Pingyuan Province. The original representatives of the provinces will generally go deep into the counties, combine with local work, extensively carry out propaganda, and mobilize the masses to promote the anti-US and Aid Korea patriotic movement in the entire North China region.
