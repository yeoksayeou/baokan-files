　　Increase Production, Donate Airplanes and Cannons to Support the Volunteer Army and Vigorously Fight the American Bandits
　　Inner Mongolian Oroqen Elementary School Students Write a Letter to Volunteer Army Uncles
Editor:
　　We are telling you about the Oroqen ethnicity's new generation—the Oroqen Elementary School students' love for the motherland and support for the Volunteer Army.
　　After the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began, the teachers in the school frequently conducted patriotic education on resisting America and aiding Korea for the students. Recently, the China People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association issued a call for donating airplanes and cannons. The teachers explained the significance of the donation movement to the students, and showed them the Northeast Pictorial that contained pictures of American devils massacring the Korean people and the People's Volunteer Army valiantly striking the enemy.
　　The children decided to do more publicity, mobilize everyone to increase production, donate airplanes and cannons; and wrote a letter to the Volunteer Army uncles. The letter said: "Dear Volunteer Army uncles! We are happily studying in school every day. Hearing about your heroic deeds makes us study even harder. Uncles, you are the most beloved people, and we want to tell you what's in our hearts. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the Oroqen ethnic group have been liberated, and we can happily study in school. We love our happy life today. And you are fighting the American devils to defend our happiness. We will do our best to support our dear uncles, hoping that you will eliminate the American devils in Korea more quickly, so that the Korean children who are suffering can live a happy life sooner. At the same time, we must also study hard and exercise to prepare ourselves to work hard for the construction of a new China in the future."

　　 增加生产捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗
　　内蒙鄂伦春族小学生       
　  写信给志愿军叔叔           编辑同志：
    我们把鄂伦春族的新生一代——鄂伦春小学校同学们热爱祖国和支援志愿军的情况告诉你们。
    抗美援朝运动开始后，学校里的老师们就经常向同学们进行抗美援朝爱国主义的教育。最近中国人民抗美援朝总会发出关于捐献飞机大炮的号召，老师就给学生们讲了捐献运动的意义，并且把刊载着美国鬼子屠杀朝鲜人民和人民志愿军英勇打击敌人画片的东北画报给同学们看。
    孩子们决定多多宣传，动员大家增加生产，捐献飞机大炮；并且写了一封信给志愿军叔叔。信中说：“亲爱的志愿军叔叔们！我们每天在学校中愉快地学习着。听到你们的英勇事迹，使我们学习更加努力了。叔叔们，你们是最可爱的人，我们要把心里的话讲给你们听。在共产党的领导下，鄂伦春族的人民得到了解放，我们才能到学校里愉快地学习。我们热爱着我们今天幸福的生活。而你们，正是为了保卫我们的幸福而和美国鬼子作战。我们尽力支援亲爱的叔叔们，希望叔叔们更快地把美国鬼子消灭在朝鲜，使朝鲜受苦难的小朋友早些过幸福的日子。同时，我们也一定要努力学习、锻炼身体，准备将来为建设新中国而努力。”
