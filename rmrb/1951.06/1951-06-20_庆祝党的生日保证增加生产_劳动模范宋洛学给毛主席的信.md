Celebrating the Party's Birthday by Guaranteeing Increased Production
    --Letter from Labor Model Song Luoxue to Chairman Mao

Respected Chairman Mao:
    Yesterday, when I returned from the fields, I thought about the approaching "July 1st" Festival. When I thought of the great festival of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, I thought of the suffering I endured in the past under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the happy life I have after being liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party. This makes me deeply realize that only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and you can we have today's good life. I will never forget this!

    In 1931, my family of five rented six mu of land from Song Luowen, and also owed 300 yuan to landlords Yang Luodong and others in Beizhuang. Because we had no money to pay interest, my nephew Guizi became a long-term worker for creditor Zhang Luoxu, and I also went out to work as a long-term laborer. The more than 50 yuan I earned each year with my sweat and blood was just enough to pay the interest, and my family still went hungry. Later, my brother and I engaged in sideline occupations in the slack seasons of spring and winter, and during the busy farming seasons, we worked as short-term laborers for others. The six mu of land we rented were all hoed during our midday breaks. My family still lived a life of gruel and vegetables. At that time, the landlords were in power in the village, and no one dared to offend them; they rented bad land to tenant farmers, and as soon as the tenant farmers had enriched the land, they would take it back. For thirty years, I suffered all kinds of grievances. There was really no way for us to survive in the old society!

    After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party established anti-Japanese democratic base areas here, and my life began to improve day by day. In 1941, I joined the Communist Party, and in 1943, I became the director of the village peasant association. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, increased wages, and rational burden, weakening the feudal exploitation of the landlord class. At this time, I bought more than ten mu of land. When the land reform was implemented in 1947, I was allocated eight mu of land and a piece of land for a house. In the past few years, through the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, and my own active production, I bought a donkey, jointly bought a waterwheel with others, and also bought two mu of land. This year, I built two new houses. Life is getting richer year by year. The year before last, I was elected as a labor model, and last year I attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference. Looking back on the past, when I suffered from the oppression of the feudal landlord class, and now I have turned myself over, my life is getting better and better, and my active production is also rewarded. It is really very different. These are all due to your wise leadership and the cultivation and education of the Party! I will definitely lead the masses to move forward forever under the leadership of the Party and you!

    Now the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea is calling for donations of airplanes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and drive the American aggressors out of Korea as soon as possible to defend our country. I resolutely respond to this call, donating 210 jin of millet to buy airplanes and cannons, and I will donate half of the annual increase in production until the end of the Korean War.

    In order to welcome the Party's birthday and donate more, I have now re-revised the production increase plan: In terms of fertilization, my eight and a half mu of 2-bis cotton have been applied with 130 jin of fine fertilizer and 77 cartloads of pig manure, and 680 jin of cottonseed cake will be applied twice as top dressing. Two mu of Victory No. 100 yams have been fertilized with 20 cartloads, and another 6 cartloads of top dressing will be applied. Twelve more cartloads of top dressing will be applied to two mu of corn. Another well will be dug to expand the paddy fields. In terms of intensive cultivation, cotton will be hoed nine times, yams will be hoed eight times, and other crops will be hoed four times. Seeds will be treated with pesticides before sowing, and a batch of insecticides will be prepared to eliminate pests in time when they are discovered. Field selection of seeds will be carried out for all crops. After the above plan is realized, cotton can be picked 350 jin per mu, yams can be harvested 4,000 jin per mu, and the remaining crops can be harvested 2 shi per mu. I will definitely take more actions to increase production to celebrate the Party's birthday and enhance the strength of national construction. I wish you good health forever.

                           Labor Model Song Luoxue, Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province

### 庆祝党的生日保证增加生产——劳动模范宋洛学给毛主席的信

　　庆祝党的生日保证增加生产
    ——劳动模范宋洛学给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    昨天我从地里回来的时候，想起“七一”节快到了。当我想起中国共产党成立三十周年这个伟大的节日，就想到过去在蒋匪国民党统治时期所受到的痛苦，和在共产党领导下翻身后的美满生活。使我深深体会到只有在共产党和你的英明领导下，才能有今天的好日子，这是我永远不会忘记的！
    在一九三一年，我全家五口人租种着宋洛稳的六亩地，还借着北庄地主杨洛东等两家三百元的债。因没有钱交利息，侄儿贵子便给债主张洛绪当了长工，我也出去当长工，每年用血汗挣来的五十多元工资刚够交利钱，家里人还是挨饿。后来我就和哥哥在春冬农闲搞副业，农忙时就给人家当短工，租的六亩地都是用歇晌的时候去锄。一家人还是过着糠一把菜一把的生活。那时村里的事情都是地主当权，谁也惹不起他们；他们把坏地租给佃户，佃户刚把地种壮了，就又给收回去了。三十年来，我受尽了冤气，旧社会里真没有我们的活路！
    抗日战争开始以后，共产党在这里建立了抗日民主根据地，我的生活才一天天地好起来。一九四一年我参加了共产党，一九四三年我当了村农会主任。在党和人民政府的领导下，实行了减租减息、增加工资、合理负担，削弱了地主阶级的封建剥削，这时我才买进了十来亩地。一九四七年实行土地改革时，我分到了八亩地，一块房基。这几年经过党和人民政府的领导扶持，自己积极生产，又买了一头驴，和别人伙买了一辆水车，还买了二亩地，今年又盖了两间新房。生活是一年比一年的富裕了。前年我当选了劳动模范，去年出席了全国劳动模范代表会议。回想过去饱受封建地主阶级的压迫，现在翻了身，生活越来越好，生产积极还受到奖励，真是大不相同了。这些都是你的英明领导和党的培养教育得来的啊！我一定带动群众，永远在党和你的领导下前进！
    现在中国人民抗美援朝总会号召捐献飞机大炮，支援中国人民志愿军，早日把美国侵略军赶出朝鲜去，保卫我们的国家。我坚决响应这个号召，捐献二百一十斤小米买飞机大炮，并要把每年增产数额的一半捐出，直至朝鲜战争胜利结束时为止。
    为了迎接党的生日和更多地捐献，现在我又重新改订了增产计划：在施肥上，我的八亩半二比斯字棉，已施细肥一百三十斤和猪粪七十七车，再用六百八十斤棉籽饼施追肥两次。二亩胜利百号山药，已施肥二十车，再施追肥六车。二亩棒子再施追肥十二车。再打一眼井，扩大水田。在精耕细作方面，棉花要锄九遍，山药锄八遍，其他作物锄四遍。播种要用药剂拌种，准备下一批杀虫药剂，发现虫害就及时除治，一切作物要做到田间选种。实现以上计划后，棉花每亩能摘三百五十斤，山药每亩能收四千斤，其余的庄稼每亩能收两石。我一定拿更多增产的行动，庆祝党的生日，增强国家建设的力量。祝你永远健康
