　　Since the spring of this year, livestock epidemics that spread across most parts of the country have recently been eradicated or have ceased to develop. Bovine pestilence in Shanxi, Hebei, and Chahar provinces has been eradicated. In Suiyuan Province, over 1,300 head of diseased cattle have been cured, and over 104,000 head of livestock have been vaccinated, thereby gradually calming the bovine pestilence epidemic in the province. In Henan Province, over 620,000 head of draught animals have been vaccinated, enabling the rapid eradication of anthrax, emphysema gangrene, and other diseases affecting draught cattle in more than 30 counties in the province since this spring. Bovine pestilence in the Gaolei area of Guangdong and in parts of Guangxi and Hubei provinces has also been basically eradicated recently. In Ningxia Province, 98% of draught cattle suffering from foot-and-mouth disease have been cured. In the southern region of Xinjiang Province, over 98,000 head of cattle, sheep, camels, and other animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease have been cured, thus basically eradicating the foot-and-mouth disease that had never been completely eliminated in the area for many years. In Gansu Province, bovine pestilence is nearing the eradication stage. Foot-and-mouth disease in most parts of Shaanxi and the eastern part of Qinghai Province has ceased to spread. In the eastern Sichuan area, veterinary personnel assisted farmers in 35 counties and cities in curing 12,000 head of draught cattle suffering from foot rot and hemorrhagic septicemia, which had been discovered since December of last year. After mobilizing farmers to clean cowsheds and improve feeding practices, the epidemic has ceased to develop.
　　This spring, the above-mentioned livestock epidemics were successively discovered in 14 provinces and regions across the country, with bovine pestilence and foot-and-mouth disease being the most widespread. In order to quickly eradicate these two epidemic diseases, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, in addition to promptly dispatching veterinary personnel with bovine pestilence serum to various epidemic areas to assist in emergency treatment, also invited Soviet experts and over 30 senior veterinary cadres from Northeast, North, East, Central South, Southwest, and Inner Mongolia to go to the Northwest foot-and-mouth disease area to assist local veterinary personnel in prevention and control. This spring, over 2.58 million head of draught cattle were vaccinated with rabbit-adapted bovine pestilence vaccine nationwide, which played a significant role in eradicating bovine pestilence. In the process of preventing and controlling bovine pestilence and foot-and-mouth disease, most areas established livestock epidemic prevention and control committees and prevention and control headquarters, mobilizing and leading a large number of veterinary personnel to carry out prevention and control with all their strength. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to blockade epidemic areas, isolate sick livestock, and bury dead livestock, effectively preventing the spread of livestock epidemics.

　　大部地区畜疫扑灭
    今春以来，蔓延全国大部地区的畜疫，最近已被扑灭或停止发展。山西、河北、察哈尔三省的牛瘟业已扑灭。绥远省已治愈病牛一千三百余头，并有十万零四千余头牲畜打了预防针，因而该省的牛瘟疫势，已渐趋平息。河南省由于给六十二万多头耕畜打了预防针，使今春以来流行于该省三十多县的耕牛炭疽疫、气肿疽等症得以迅速扑灭。广东高雷专区及广西、湖北两省部分地区的牛瘟，最近也已基本扑灭。宁夏省患口蹄疫的耕牛，已有百分之九十八被治愈。新疆省南部地区，已治好染有口蹄疫的牛、羊、骆驼等九万八千余头，因而该区多年来都未根绝过的口蹄疫，已被基本扑灭。甘肃省的牛瘟已近扑灭阶段。陕西大部地区和青海东部地区的口蹄疫，已停止流行。川东区三十五县市自去年十二月起所发现的耕牛腐蹄病和出血性败血病等症，经该区兽医人员协助各地农民治愈耕牛一万二千头，并发动农民扫清牛舍、改善饲养后，疫势已停止发展。
    今年春季，全国有十四个省区，先后发现上述畜疫，其中尤以牛瘟和口蹄疫的流行地区最广。为迅速扑灭这两种疫病，中央人民政府农业部除及时调派兽医人员携带牛瘟血清往各地疫区协助抢治外，并邀请苏联专家及东北、华北、华东、中南、西南、内蒙古等地高级兽医干部三十余人，前往西北口蹄疫区，协助当地兽医人员进行防治。全国各地今春用兔化牛瘟疫苗预防注射的耕牛达二百五十八万余头，对扑灭牛瘟作用很大。在防治牛瘟和口蹄疫的过程中，大部地区都建立了畜疫防治委员会和防治指挥部等组织，动员和领导大批兽医人员，全力进行防治。同时发动群众封锁疫区、隔离病畜、掩埋死畜，有效地防止了畜疫的蔓延。
