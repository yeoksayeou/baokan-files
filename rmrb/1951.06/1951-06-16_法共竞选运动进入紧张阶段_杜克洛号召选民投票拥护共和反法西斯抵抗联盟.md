Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 15th: According to TASS, the French National Assembly elections, scheduled for June 17th, are rapidly approaching, and the French Communist Party's election campaign has entered its most intense phase. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party passed a resolution on the 7th entitled "Victory of the Election Campaign," calling on all members and all French people concerned about the future of the motherland to redouble their efforts so that on election day, "the policy of national independence and domestic and international peace can triumph." Although the French reactionaries have exhausted all means of terror to persecute the Communist Party's election activities, under the strong support and protection of the French working class, the Communist Party holds many mass rallies across the country every day to expose the crimes of the French reactionaries and explain its program to the French people. On the evening of the 11th, forty-seven rallies were held in Paris alone. French Communist Party Secretary Duclos delivered a speech on the 10th in the constituency of French Prime Minister Queuille, Corrèze province, to a voters' meeting of more than 10,000 people in Brive-la-Gaillarde, exposing the anti-democratic and anti-popular policies of the current French government headed by Queuille. Duclos called on voters to vote for the candidates put forward by the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance, that is, the alliance fighting for national independence, bread, freedom, and peace. The audience welcomed this call with long and unceasing applause.
　　A rally of 30,000 people was held in Marseille, and French Communist Party Secretary Marty spoke. At the election meeting in Vitry, Seine, FCP Central Committee member Vermersch delivered a speech.
　　On the 9th, Duclos delivered a radio address to the nation regarding the election. He explained how the French government party, under American manipulation, is sacrificing the lives of working people to prepare for war. He pointed out that since the government party, at the behest of the United States, expelled the Communists from the government in 1947, military spending has increased from 250 billion francs to 800 billion francs, but Washington still considers it insufficient. The French rulers accepted the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Pact, and the Schuman Plan, which enslaved the French people, making France a protectorate of the United States. Because the French people refuse to accept the war policy that requires paying a huge price, the government and de Gaulle's French People's Rally are preparing to use fascist methods to force the people to accept this policy. Under these circumstances, French voters must make a decisive choice between war and peace, democracy and fascism. Duclos then announced the Communist Party's program, explaining that the Communist Party guarantees to safeguard peace and restore France's national independence; carry out tax reform and ensure a balanced budget, drastically reducing war and police expenditures; improve the living standards of working people; the Communist Party advocates land to the tillers, and advocates protecting and reforming agriculture; protect the business of handicrafts and small industrialists; the Communist Party advocates dissolving the groups that create civil war - the French People's Rally. Duclos stated that the French Communist Party is determined to fight together with French men and women holding various opinions and religious beliefs to establish a government determined to stop heading towards destruction.

　　法共竞选运动进入紧张阶段        
    杜克洛号召选民投票拥护共和反法西斯抵抗联盟
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：定于六月十七日举行的法国国民议会选举已日益迫近，法国共产党的竞选运动也已进入了最紧张的阶段。法国共产党政治局在七日通过一项题为“竞选运动的胜利”的决议，号召全体党员和一切关心祖国前途的法国人加倍努力，以便在选举日，“国家独立和国内外和平的政策可以胜利。”虽然法国反动派用尽一切恐怖手段来迫害共产党的竞选活动，但是，在法国工人阶级强大的支持与保卫下，共产党每一天都在全国各地召开许多群众大会，向法国人民揭露法国反动派的罪恶，说明自己的纲领。十一日晚上，仅在巴黎一地即举行了四十七个大会。法国共产党书记杜克洛十日在法国总理葛义的选区高莱兹省，向布列夫·拉·盖亚尔市一万余人参加的选民大会上发表演说，揭露以葛义为首的法国现政府的反民主反人民的政策。杜克洛号召选民投票拥护共和反法西斯抵抗联盟，亦即争取民族独立、面包、自由及和平的联盟所提出的候选人。听众以长久不息的鼓掌来欢迎这个号召。
    马赛举行了三万人参加的大会，法国共产党书记马尔梯讲了话。在塞纳省维德里的竞选大会上法共中央委员维美徐发表了演说。
    九日，杜克洛曾向全国发表竞选的广播演说。他说明了法国政府党怎样在美国操纵下，牺牲劳动人民的生活来准备战争。他指出自从一九四七年政府党奉美国之命把共产党人逐出政府以来，军费支出已由二千五百亿法郎增加到八千亿法郎，可是华盛顿还认为不够。法国统治者接受了奴役法国人民的马歇尔计划、大西洋公约和舒曼计划，使法国成为美国的保护国。由于法国人民拒绝接受需要偿付极大代价的战争政策，政府和戴高乐的法兰西人民联盟就准备用法西斯方法强使人民接受这种政策。在这种情况下，法国选民必须在战争与和平，民主与法西斯主义之间，作决定性的选择。杜克洛接着宣布共产党的纲领，说明共产党保证维护和平与恢复法国的民族独立；进行改革税制并确保预算平衡，大量减少战争和警察的开支；提高劳动人民的生活水平；共产党主张耕者有其田，主张保护与革新农业；保护手工业与小工业家的营业；共产党主张解散制造内战的集团——法兰西人民联盟。杜克洛表示，法国共产党决心与持有各种见解与宗教信仰的法国男女共同奋斗，以建立一个决心停止走向毁灭的政府。
