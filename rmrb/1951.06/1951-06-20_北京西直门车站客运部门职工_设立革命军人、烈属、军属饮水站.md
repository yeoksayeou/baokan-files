Beijing Xizhimen Railway Station Passenger Department Employees

Establish Drinking Water Station for Revolutionary Soldiers, Martyrs' Families, and Military Dependents

Comrade Editor:

　　All employees of the Beijing Xizhimen Railway Station Passenger Department warmly responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea to promote patriotic pacts, donate airplanes and cannons, and provide preferential treatment to families of martyrs and military dependents. In addition to using their spare time to unload goods and increase production, donating the increased income to airplanes and cannons, everyone also voluntarily donated money to prepare tea tables and tea sets in the waiting room, establishing a tea station to provide preferential treatment to revolutionary soldiers, families of martyrs, and military dependents. Since the beginning, revolutionary soldiers and military dependents have constantly sat there drinking tea, and everyone feels grateful and honored. Seventeen people wrote their opinions in the specially prepared opinion book. Comrade Li Quanlong, a soldier, wrote: "Your actions have moved my heart. I will definitely study hard and defend our country well." Ordinary passengers were also moved when they saw this. An old man said: "Your hospitality is really thoughtful. I will tell the village chief when I return to the village and ask everyone to learn from your spirit."

　　北京西直门车站客运部门职工        
    设立革命军人、烈属、军属饮水站编辑同志：
    北京西直门车站客运部门的全体职工，热烈响应中国人民抗美援朝总会关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召。大家除利用业余休班时间卸车生产，以增加的收入捐献飞机大炮外，并自动捐钱，在候车室内备置茶桌、茶具，设立了优待革命军人、烈属、军属茶水站。自开始以来，不断有革命军人及军属坐在那里喝茶，大家心里又感激，又觉得光荣。在特备的意见簿上，有十七个人写下了自己的意见。军人李全龙同志写道：“你们的行动感动了我的心，我一定努力学习本领，好好保卫咱们的国家。”一般旅客们看见这事也很感动，有一个老乡说：“你们的招待真周到，我回到村里也得跟村长说说，要大家学习你们这种精神。”
