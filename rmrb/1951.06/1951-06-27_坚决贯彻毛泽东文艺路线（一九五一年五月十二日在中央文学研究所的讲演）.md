　　Resolutely Implement Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Line
   (Speech at the Central Institute of Literature, May 12, 1951)
        Zhou Yang
  The Historical Significance of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
    Literature and art are one of the powerful weapons for educating the broad masses of people in the communist worldview and the people's democratic revolution. Since the "May Fourth" Movement, the mainstream of new literature and art has developed under the guidance of communist thought and the Chinese Communist Party, and is closely linked to the great struggle of the Chinese people against imperialism and feudalism. In 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" advanced the new literature and art to a new historical stage. If the "May Fourth" Movement was the first literary revolution in modern Chinese literary history, then the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the changes it brought about in the literary field can be said to be the second greater and more profound literary revolution after the "May Fourth" Movement. This speech not only powerfully swept away all reactionary literature and art of imperialism and feudalism, but also conducted a serious and sharp criticism specifically targeting various petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts and tendencies. Because in progressive literary and art circles, the roots of petty-bourgeois thought are particularly deep, and revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers and artists often appear in the guise of the proletariat, making it easiest to confuse the ideological boundaries between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, distinguishing the boundaries between proletarian thought and all non-proletarian thought, safeguarding the purity and seriousness of proletarian thought, and truly attracting revolutionary petty-bourgeois writers and artists to the proletarian side is a particularly important, difficult, and complex task of struggle on the ideological front. Comrade Mao Zedong correctly proposed that literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which relates to the entire worldview of writers and the transformation of their own thoughts and feelings. And this is precisely the key to all problems. Comrade Mao Zedong solved the task of combining literature and art with the broad masses of the people from this fundamental key, which was a task that had been attempted but not solved since the "May Fourth" Movement. Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought armed all Party and non-Party revolutionary writers and artists, led them to the road of combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and made literature and art and literary and art workers take on a completely new look from then on.
  Struggle to Implement Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Line
    In July 1949, three months before the founding of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers held in Beijing made a preliminary summary of the achievements in literary and artistic creation since 1942. Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought won the unanimous support of literary and art workers from various departments and with different tendencies. "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" became the common fighting program of the new Chinese literary and art movement. In the past two years, Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought has been widely disseminated among intellectuals throughout the country. Under the guidance of this thought, literature and art have achieved a further combination with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Literary and art work has achieved many new successes.

    In the past two years, the more outstanding works in literary and artistic creation include: those expressing the battles of the People's Liberation Army and their heroism, such as Liu Baiyu's "The Torch Ahead," Gu Ligao's "Always Forward," Han Feng's "Yin Qingchun," Han Xiliang's "Sixty-Eight Days" (all novels), Jiao Fuchun's "Storm on the Sea" (reportage), Hu Ke's "Growing Up in Battle" (play), and some recent well-written news reports from the Korean front, such as Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Lovable People?"; those depicting the heroic stories of the people's struggle against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, such as Xu Guangyao's "Flames on the Plain," Chen Dengke's "Sister-in-Law Du," and "Living People's Pond" (all novels); those depicting the drastic changes in the lives and thoughts of the working people in cities after liberation, such as Lao She's "Fang Pearl" and "Dragon Beard Ditch"; those depicting rural construction and the new lives of peasants, such as Kefu's "The Dyke" (play), Bai Wei's "Reclaiming the Wilderness," Wang Anyou's "Li Ersao Remarries," Zhao Shuli's "Registration," and Gu Yu's "New Things Done in a New Way" (all novels), etc. Those depicting industrial construction include Zhao Xi's "The Beginning of Transformation" (novel) and Du Yin's "In the Face of New Things" (play). Particularly noteworthy is that new writers have directly emerged from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chen Dengke, the author of "Sister-in-Law Du" and "Living People's Pond," is a poor peasant by origin who only learned to read and write after joining the People's Liberation Army. His creation has proved that he is an excellent and promising author. He wrote about the strong and true emotions and strength of the working people. In his works, it is not so much the author describing, but life itself speaking. Life itself is such a heart-stirring, earth-shattering storm of struggle.

    People's films are the youngest among various art forms, but also the most popular and most powerful art form. In the past two years, successful or relatively successful works in film include "The White-Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "Shangrao Concentration Camp," "New Children's Heroes," "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," and "Unite for Tomorrow," etc. People's films have won the love of a wide audience, resolutely abandoned the influence of American Hollywood films, and began to establish China's own national and working-class style in film art.

    In the past two years, the work of reforming various old art forms popular among the people, especially the work of opera reform, has achieved remarkable results. The vast number of opera artists have shown unprecedented political enthusiasm and artistic innovation spirit. They have created a large number of new opera scripts and lyrics. The reform of old New Year pictures and old comic strips has resulted in the creation of many new New Year pictures and new comic strips with new content and new forms. The new opera developed on the basis of the old Yangko opera in the Northwest has been promoted throughout the country, stimulating the new development of the original folk drama and music forms in various places, and these folk forms are constantly being absorbed into the creation of new opera. Mass dance has developed particularly rapidly and has some new creations.

    The mass character of our literature and art is also reflected in the fact that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have their own amateur literary and art activities. This activity has become an important part of the mass cultural life and one of the important forms of the masses educating themselves. Our literature and art is composed of two parts: professional literary and art activities and mass amateur literary and art activities. Now, in rural areas, troops, and factories, amateur theater groups and other various cultural and entertainment organizations are extremely common. The masses write, perform, and sing themselves, producing many excellent creations. The two scripts "Not a Cicada" and "Gate No. 6" and the poems and paintings created by workers particularly demonstrate the genius of the Chinese working class in artistic creation.

    Every achievement we have made in literary and art work is the result of correctly implementing Mao Zedong's literary and art line. But compared with the great struggle of the Chinese people and their achievements in various fields, the achievements of literary and art work are still too small. In addition to many reasons, one of the most important reasons is that we have not implemented Mao Zedong's literary and art line enough. Mao Zedong's literary and art line is the class line and mass line in literature and art. Literature and art should serve the people, first of all, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and literary and art workers must combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; without this combination, the source of literary and artistic creation will be cut off, and the ideological transformation of the literary and art workers themselves will lose its basis.

    In his great work "On Practice," Comrade Mao Zedong most profoundly and concisely explained the truth that human understanding cannot be separated from practice. He said: "If you want to know a certain thing or certain things, you have no way to solve it except by contacting that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) the environment of that thing." "If you want to directly understand some kind or some things, you can only personally participate in the struggle of changing reality, changing some kind or some things in practice, in order to touch the phenomenon of that kind or those things, and only by personally participating in the struggle of changing reality in practice can the essence of that kind or those things be exposed and understood." Literature and art is one of the means of understanding reality. If a literary and art worker wants to truly reflect reality, he must "personally participate in the struggle of changing reality in practice."

    In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Comrade Mao Zedong made such an appeal to literary and art workers: "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, go to the fiery struggle, go to the only broadest and richest source, observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the processing process, that is, the creation process, and thus unify the raw materials and production, and the research process and the creation process." This is a fundamental instruction. None of our literary and art workers do not support Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in words, and the vast majority of them also support it sincerely; but on the fundamental issue that literary and art workers must combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, there often occur ambiguity, wavering, and resistance. Comrade Mao Zedong wants us to go to the mass struggle "for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly," but some of our literary and art workers are often "temporarily, conditionally, and half-heartedly." Comrade Mao Zedong wants us to plunge into the "fiery struggle" of the masses, but some of our literary and art workers often stand outside this "fiery struggle." Some literary and art workers even advocate that any kind of life has its meaning, and there is no need to particularly pursue the life of mass struggle, so as to rationalize their separation from the masses and separation from the actual situation. Comrade Mao Zedong wants us to "observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle," but some of our literary and art workers limit the scope of their creation to a very narrow range. The characteristic of formalism in literature and art is to understand and describe the originally multi-faceted, complex, and tortuous life phenomena as one-sided, simplified, and linear. Formalists observe and describe life not according to the diversity of life but according to the same old formula, which not only simplifies complex life phenomena but also vulgarizes true politics, that is, the politics of the masses. On the other hand, the characteristic of formalism is to fabricate unrealistic stories, vividly describe them, and replace the dialectics of life itself with artificial, "dramatic" contradictions and tortuous plots, covering up the emptiness of the content of life. Both formalism and formalism mainly stem from being divorced from reality and being divorced from the masses. In some departments of literary and art work and in some comrades, there is a serious tendency to be divorced from reality and being divorced from the masses. This is the most harmful tendency in current literary and art work.

    Once our literary and art workers are divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, they will inevitably be invaded by various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts and become prisoners of those thoughts. Being divorced from the masses and being divorced from reality, this tendency itself, according to Lenin, is "one of the greatest scourges left to us by capitalist society." Since our literature and art is to benefit the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is basically to serve them, then our literary and artistic thought cannot be bourgeois or petty-bourgeois, but must be proletarian. Because only the proletarian thought and stand can correctly understand the workers, peasants, and all other classes; only by using the proletarian artistic method (the method of revolutionary realism) can we correctly reflect the workers, peasants, and all other classes; and only in this way can we guarantee that literature and art will always be in line with the needs of the people and the needs of actual struggle. Therefore, our primary task at present is to implement Mao Zedong's literary and art line in the entire literary and art work and struggle against all tendencies that deviate from this line.
  Express the Great Theme of Patriotism
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in his "Opening Address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference": "The Chinese, who account for a quarter of the total human population, have stood up from now on. China has always been a great, brave, and hardworking nation, but it has lagged behind in modern times. This lag is entirely the result of oppression and exploitation by foreign imperialism and domestic reactionary governments. ... Our nation will no longer be an insulted nation, we have stood up." This solemn declaration stipulates the correct position of the Chinese people on the modern world stage. Expressing the Chinese people who have "stood up" has become the central theme of patriotic literature and art.

    Our literature and art has always been patriotic, that is to say, it has always opposed imperialist aggression and feudal oppression, and is full of hatred for all aggressors and oppressors and a deep concern for the fate of its own nation. Now the Chinese people have overthrown the rule of domestic and foreign reactionaries on their own territory and established their own regime - the people's democratic dictatorship. The current tasks of the Chinese people are to resist the US and aid Korea, and continue to oppose imperialist aggression; to carry out land reform and completely eliminate feudalism; to suppress and eliminate counter-revolutionaries; and to restore and develop production, so that China can get rid of the economic and cultural backwardness caused by past history, and become an economically prosperous and culturally developed country. The Chinese people are fighting to complete these huge historical tasks. The Chinese people, who have always been hardworking and brave, have gradually improved their level of consciousness through training and education in the long process of revolutionary struggle and under the people's democratic system. New figures, heroes, and models on the battlefield, in production, and in various other jobs are constantly emerging from them. Our literature and art should first express these advanced figures among the Chinese people, express the great strength of the Chinese nation and the Chinese Communist Party, their high wisdom and heroism. The long-term cruel and dark rule of imperialism and feudalism over the Chinese people has, on the one hand, created the Chinese people's infinite revolutionary perseverance and determination, and on the other hand, has also created a certain degree of national inferiority complex in some Chinese people, which is precisely combined with the inherent wavering and weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Literature and art should help the people to sweep away this inferiority complex caused by the long-term national humiliation, and establish the national self-esteem that is suitable for our country's status today and that the great Chinese people should have, and strengthen the people's belief in their own great strength and bright future. Unfortunately, our literature and art has not been able to fully do this. It has not been able to fully express the strength of the Chinese people who have "stood up," its characters are often not standing up in "spiritual state," and sometimes even in image, they are stooping. For the enemies of the people - imperialists, feudalists, and all counter-revolutionaries, their sinful atrocities should be powerfully exposed; but some works of art mistakenly describe the enemy's strength as exceeding the people's strength, and even describe the imperialists' behavior of insulting our Chinese people with relish, without feeling any damage to the dignity of their own nation.

    The Chinese people have finally achieved today's victory after a long and arduous struggle, finally getting rid of the tragic fate of past life, and starting to build their own new life. The old, dark, and tragic era is gone forever. However, some of our works of art still remain in the simple and painful memories of the past tragic life, and do not sufficiently depict the reality of the people's new and happy life today and the prospect of a better life tomorrow. It is very necessary for works of art to record the history of the people's life and struggle full of blood and tears, but we cannot let the painful memories of history excessively burden us.

    It is very necessary for our literary and art works to describe the arduous process of the people transforming themselves in the struggle. This transformation process will be long-term. Literature and art should reflect and promote this transformation process, so as to help the people gradually improve to the level of democratic and socialist consciousness. However, some literary and art works are excessively enthusiastic about describing negative characters among the people and portraying the backward factors remaining on the people, instead of or not being good at describing positive characters among the people and portraying the new factors that are being produced on the people. Some authors often only see backward phenomena when they go among the masses, and therefore are confused by these backward phenomena, and do not know that in all movements and all struggles, the progressive and positive factors are constantly playing a role and determining everything, rather than the backward and negative factors. Even when some authors describe positive characters, they do not focus on expressing their new and noble qualities, but often try to find some weaknesses or dark aspects in the depths of their souls.

    Recently, Ding Kexin's novel "Old Worker Guo Fushan," published in the first issue of the fourth volume of "People's Literature," can be taken as such an example. This novel writes that: Guo Fushan's son, Guo Zhanxiang, a railway worker leader who is described by the author as a model in all aspects, "capable, prestigious, and unanimously supported by all members of the branch," and is also the branch secretary of the work section, such a character, when the war of aggression against Korea by the US imperialism occurred, and enemy planes bombed our territory, suddenly became afraid of planes and became a "soft bone who is afraid of planes, afraid of bombing, and afraid of death." It turned out that he had been captured by the Japanese devils to Beiman to work as a laborer, and one night, the Japanese devils shot and killed two hundred laborers with machine guns, and he escaped from the pile of dead people, and since then he was afraid of the "哒哒哒..." sound of machine guns. His non-Party member old father asked the branch to expel his unfilial son from the Party, and the general branch secretary leniently handled the matter, only removing Guo Zhanxiang from the position of branch secretary. Later, under the influence of his father, he became not afraid of planes, and thus became a "father and son hero." It is very obvious that the author not only distortedly described the image of a model communist party member, but also completely obliterated the role of the Communist Party's education and leadership. It seems that a model communist party member is not as good as an ordinary old worker; it seems that at the most critical moment, what determines a person's action is not the degree of his political consciousness, but the physiological and psychological defects and abnormalities caused by some reason; it seems that the fierce behavior of the imperialists can scare the Chinese workers; it seems that what makes a communist party member correct his mistakes is not the Party's education, but the father's education. In the whole incident, the decisive factor is the physiological factor, not the political factor; the family relationship, not the party relationship. Such a work, in terms of political and ideological content, is completely wrong, is this not obvious?

    As a contrast, Han Feng's novel "Yin Qingchun" in the second issue of the second volume of the same "People's Literature" powerfully expresses the new qualities of the people's soldiers. The protagonist Yin Qingchun also has shortcomings, he committed a little battlefield discipline, and precisely because of this reason, he was not able to solve the problem of party membership. He was in pain, and his firm will to strive to join the party dominated his entire life. He stood up to all the tests. As the political commissar described him: "He is an 'iron man'. Some people are often not afraid of the enemy, but cannot bear the difficulties that come from themselves, this person is not afraid of anything, and is hard no matter where he is placed." He finally made meritorious service and joined the party. When he was approved to join the party, he said: "This is the glory that the party gave me. When I come to a difficult time, I think of the party and I have strength. Otherwise, what am I worth?"

    When a soldier fights bravely simply to defend his home and defend a piece of his own land, when a peasant actively produces simply to get rich, then it cannot be said that he is a new person. Only when a person realizes that he can fight for the public interest and can put the interests of the country and all the people above the interests of individuals or families can this person be said to be a new person, and his qualities are new qualities.

    Our literary and art works must express these new qualities of the new people, express the heroic image of the Communist Party members, and use their heroic deeds and exemplary behavior to educate the broad masses and young people. This is the most important task in current literary and artistic creation.

    Another aspect of patriotism is how to treat historical figures and traditions. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his book "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "The Chinese nation is not only known to the world for its hard work and endurance, but also a nation that loves freedom and is rich in revolutionary traditions. ... In the thousands of years of history of the Chinese nation, many national heroes and revolutionary leaders have been produced. ... Therefore, the Chinese nation is also a nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition and excellent historical heritage." We must affirm and commend all heroic figures who have promoted historical progress in the past and have made beneficial creations for the people. But we do not allow historical reactionaries to be described as revolutionaries, as the movie "Wu Xun Zhuan" did, and even when describing historical revolutionary heroes, our praise and praise cannot be contrary to history. No outstanding revolutionary hero in history can be compared to the great leader of the modern working class. Such a comparison is wrong in principle. When the German bourgeois writer Ludwig talked with Comrade Stalin, he proposed to compare him with Peter the Great. Comrade Stalin opposed this historical comparison. He said that if Lenin is to be compared with Peter the Great, then "Peter the Great is just a drop in the ocean, while Lenin is the entire vast ocean." This is an important principle we have in evaluating historical figures.
  Inherit the Fine Traditions of National Literature and Art
    The new people's literature and art must be connected with the fine traditions of our own national literature and art, and develop and enrich the national forms of literary and artistic creation.

    Our literary and artistic heritage is very rich. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "China's long feudal society created a splendid ancient culture. Therefore, cleaning up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence. But we must never uncritically absorb everything, and we must distinguish between all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent ancient folk culture, that is, the things that are somewhat democratic and revolutionary. China's current new politics and new economy have developed from the old politics and old economy of ancient times, and China's current new culture has also developed from the old culture of ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our own history and never cut off history." Thinking that the new culture is completely transplanted from the West, and not based on its own national foundation; thinking that the development of a new national culture can be done without the necessary critical work of cleaning up the development process of ancient culture, and that the new national culture can not be in touch with the old national culture, this is a harmful view of cutting off history. Many literary and art workers and young people blindly worship the West, despise the traditions of national literature and art, despise folk forms, and despise the hobbies and tastes of the masses, which is also a manifestation of losing national self-confidence and lacking mass viewpoint. This is a serious obstacle to the popularization and improvement of literature and art. Of course, we are not national conservatives. We must learn from foreign countries, especially from the Soviet Union. Socialist realism literature and art is the most beneficial spiritual food for the Chinese people and the vast number of intellectuals, and we will strengthen the work of translation and introduction in the future. Learning the experience of advanced countries is precisely for the purpose of creating our own national experience; respecting the history and cultural traditions of other nations is even more important to respect the history and cultural traditions of our own nation, otherwise, we are not true patriots, nor are we true internationalists. True internationalists cannot be empty-handed. Our skills in literature and art are very inadequate and need to be learned and improved. But learning skills does not mean imitating Western forms, but precisely for the purpose of developing and enriching our own national forms.

    The most important factor in form is language. Comrade Stalin said: "Proletarian culture with socialist content, among the nations participating in socialist construction, takes various different forms of expression and methods according to the differences in language customs, etc." Language and customs must be learned from the actual life of the people and from the traditional literature and art of the country. Comrade Mao Zedong puts learning language in the first place. Of course, the factors of literary and artistic form are not only language, but also other factors, such as structure, etc. The language is concise and natural. The characters are clearly defined. The plot development is clearly explained, with a beginning and an end. This is the fine tradition of our literature and art and is worthy of our learning. Our literature and art must overcome the shortcomings of not being popular, and the popularization of literature and art is inseparable from nationalization. Lu Xun said: "When old literature declines, a new transformation arises because it absorbs folk literature or foreign literature. This example is often seen in literary history." This new transformation has already taken place in China. This is the development process and road of China's new literature and art from the "May Fourth" Movement to the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." We must make every effort to accelerate the completion of this transformation.

    To inherit the fine traditions of national art, on the one hand, we must widely carry out the work of collecting, sorting out, and researching, and on the other hand, we must first carry out the work of reforming the old art forms that are currently most popular among the masses.

    China's drama heritage is very rich, and it preserves many excellent historical stories and legends and myths. This form of opera is still loved by the vast number of people. The types of opera forms in the country are extremely numerous. Various local operas have the characteristics of local language, music, and customs. Various local operas, folk small operas, and quyi should be universally explored, researched, and transformed, so that they can be developed on a new basis. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the recent "Instructions on Opera Reform Work" of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the main policy of opera reform work is to encourage free competition among various opera forms, so as to achieve "letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new from the old." In terms of music, we should continue to strengthen the research work of folk music, and pay attention to the research and transformation of Chinese opera music, storytelling music, and Chinese national instrumental music. The dances of the various ethnic groups in China are rich and healthy and should be widely collected and developed. In terms of painting, we should inherit and develop the correct tradition of Chinese painting. The work of sorting out and studying China's literary heritage is the most arduous. The first thing that needs to be done is the research work of modern Chinese literary history and modern literary history.

    We respect our own national literary and artistic heritage, not adopting a blindly praise attitude, but adopting a strict scientific and critical attitude. From the entire heritage, we only "absorb its democratic essence" and resolutely "remove its feudal dross"; we accept this "democratic essence" part as a fine tradition and develop it on a new basis. We do not regard national form as fixed and unchanging, but regard national form as developing and constantly transforming and innovating in the process of practice. We are developing viewpoints on art issues, just like on all other issues, rather than conservative viewpoints. The task of our entire literary and art work is mainly not to preserve the old national literature and art, but to develop the new national literature and art. Comrades engaged in opera reform should pay special attention to preventing the spread of feudal toxins from all aspects, and must resolutely reform the reactionary feudal content in the old operas, and at the same time reform all the corrupt and backward forms that are closely related to those contents. Only in this way can we complete the task of "bringing forth the new from the old."

    Correctly solving the problem of inheriting the fine traditions of our own national literature and art, our new literature and art will develop more deeply among the broad masses of the people.
  Strengthen Criticism and Self-Criticism in Literary and Art Work, Overcome the Work Style of Liberalism and Vulgar
        Habits
    Today, China's literature and art is a united front, which includes various different thoughts and tendencies of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie, but it must be guided by the thought of the working class, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought. All communist party members and revolutionary literary and art workers must strive to improve their level of knowledge in Marxism-Leninism, which is a prerequisite for improving the ideological, artistic, and fighting qualities of literature and art. We must use the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism, and not any other viewpoints and methods, to first sweep away the ideological influence of imperialism and feudalism on the literary and art front, and at the same time criticize all the erroneous thoughts of the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and the peasants. In particular, the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, which are cloaked in Marxism-Leninism, must be thoroughly exposed. The debate on Wu Xun and the movie "Wu Xun Zhuan" exposed a serious state in our ideological work and literary and art work, that is, many of our comrades have become politically and ideologically paralyzed in the new environment, and have begun to lose the ideological sharpness that a communist party member should have, and have lost the ability to distinguish and criticize hostile and erroneous thoughts. This state is related to the work style of liberalism that exists among many of our literary and art workers; from the perspective of leadership responsibility, it is also related to the work style of businessism that exists in the leadership of our literary and art work.

    We must overcome the work style of businessism in the leadership work of literature and art. Businessism leadership is a kind of unthinking leadership. It does not pay attention to leading the literary and art cause politically and ideologically, does not care about the activities of creation and criticism, and is accustomed to replacing meticulous ideological work with simple administrative methods.

    We must overcome the work style of liberalism and vulgar habits that exist among literary and art workers. These work styles and habits are manifested in: not criticizing or struggling against all hostile and erroneous thoughts, living in peace with them, and even echoing them, not liking to listen to criticism, and refusing criticism with various excuses; in the relationship between literary and art workers, talking about friendship, talking about face, and not establishing correct principled relationships; vulgarizing serious ideological struggle.

    The most important method to overcome all the above-mentioned bad work styles is to carry out criticism and self-criticism in literary and art work. Literary criticism is an important tool for realizing the party's leadership in literary and art work. We must further improve the political and ideological content of criticism and combine it with the artistic analysis of specific works. On the one hand, criticism should struggle against all bad tendencies in literature and art, and on the other hand, it should pay attention to discovering new forces, new achievements, and new experiences in literature and art, and promote and praise them.

    Under the direction of Mao Zedong's literary and art direction, under the constant concern and guidance of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong personally on literary and art work, the shortcomings of our literary and art work can be overcome. Overcome shortcomings and continue to move forward. Let us continue to struggle to implement Mao Zedong's literary and art line on the entire literary and art front!

　　坚决贯彻毛泽东文艺路线
   （一九五一年五月十二日在中央文学研究所的讲演）

  “在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的历史意义
    文学艺术是对广大人民进行共产主义的人生观与人民民主革命的教育的有力武器之一。“五四”以来，新文艺的主流就是在共产主义思想与中国共产党的指导之下发展起来的，和中国人民反对帝国主义、反对封建主义的伟大斗争密切结合而不可分的。一九四二年毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，把新文艺推进到了一个新的历史阶段。假如说“五四”是中国近代文学史上的第一次文学革命，那么“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的发表及其所引起的在文学事业上的变革，可以说是继“五四”之后的第二次更伟大、更深刻的文学革命。这个讲话，不但有力地扫荡了一切帝国主义、封建主义的反动文艺，而且特别针对各种小资产阶级的文艺思想和倾向，进行了严正而尖锐的批判。因为在进步文艺界，小资产阶级思想的根株特别地深，而革命的小资产阶级文艺家又时常以无产阶级面貌出现，最容易混淆无产阶级与小资产阶级的思想界限。因此，区别无产阶级思想与一切非无产阶级思想的界限，保卫无产阶级思想的纯洁性、严肃性，并把革命的小资产阶级文艺家真正吸引到无产阶级方面来，是思想战线上的一个特殊重要的、困难的、复杂的斗争任务。毛泽东同志正确地提出文艺必须为工农兵服务，这就关涉到作家的整个人生观，他们本身思想感情的改造的问题。而这就恰是一切问题的关键。毛泽东同志就从这个根本关键上解决了文艺与广大人民结合的任务，这是“五四”以来所一直企图解决而没有能够解决的任务。毛泽东的文艺思想武装了一切党的与非党的革命的文艺家，把他们引到了与工农群众结合的道路，使文艺与文艺工作者从此面貌一新。
  为贯彻毛泽东文艺路线斗争
    一九四九年七月，即中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立之前三个月，在北京举行的全国文学艺术工作者代表大会对一九四二年以来的文艺创作上的成果作了一个初步的总结。毛泽东的文艺思想，取得了各个不同部门、不同倾向的文艺工作者的一致拥护。“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”成了新中国文艺运动的战斗的共同纲领。两年以来，毛泽东文艺思想在全国知识分子中有了极广泛的传播。在这个思想指导之下，文艺与工农兵群众达到了进一步的结合。文艺工作取得了许多新的成绩。
    两年来，在文艺创作上比较优秀的作品，可以举出：表现人民解放军的战斗和他们的英雄主义的，有刘白羽的《火光在前》，古立高的《永远向着前面》，寒风的《尹青春》，韩希梁的《六十八天》（以上小说），矫福纯的《海上风暴》（报导），胡可的《战斗里成长》（剧本），及最近的一些朝鲜前线的写得很好的通讯报导，如魏巍的《谁是最可爱的人》等；描写抗日战争与解放战争时期人民对敌斗争的英勇故事的，有徐光耀的《平原烈火》，陈登科的《杜大嫂》，《活人塘》（以上小说）；描写解放后城市中劳动人民的生活和思想的剧烈变化的，有老舍的《方珍珠》，《龙须沟》；描写农村建设与农民的新的生活的，有柯夫的《堤》（剧本），白危的《渡荒》，王安友的《李二嫂改嫁》，赵树理的《登记》，谷峪的《新事新办》（以上小说）等。描写工业建设的，有赵熙的《改造的开端》（小说），杜印的《在新事物面前》（剧本）。特别值得注意的，是已经从工农群众中直接产生了新的作家。陈登科，《杜大嫂》，《活人塘》的作者，就是一个贫农出身，完全在参加了解放军以后才学文化写文章的。他的创作已证明他是一个优秀的有希望的作者。他写出了劳动人民的强烈的真实情感和力量。在他的作品中，简直不是作者在描写，而是生活本身在说话。生活本身就是那样一场惊心动魄，天旋地转的斗争的风暴。
    人民电影在各种艺术中是最年青的，但也是最群众化的、最有力量的一种艺术形式。两年来，电影上成功或比较成功的作品，有《白毛女》，《钢铁战士》，《上饶集中营》，《新儿女英雄传》，《内蒙人民的胜利》，《团结起来到明天》等。人民电影已经获得了广大观众的喜爱，它坚决地抛弃了美国好莱坞电影的影响，开始建立了电影艺术上中国民族自己的、工农大众的风格。
    两年来，改革民间流行的各种旧有艺术形式的工作，首先是戏曲改革的工作，收到了显著的成效。广大戏曲艺人表现了从所未有的政治积极性与艺术上的革新精神。他们创作了极大数量的新的戏曲剧本、唱词。旧年画、旧连环画的改革，结果就创造出了不少新内容、新形式的新年画、新连环画。在西北旧有的秧歌剧的基础上发展起来的新歌剧，推广到了全国各地，刺激了各地方原有的民间戏剧、音乐形式的新的发展，而这些民间形式，就不断地被吸收到新歌剧的创造中来。群众性的舞蹈发展特别迅速，并且有了一些新的创造。
    我们的文艺的群众性的特点，还表现在广大工农兵群众有自己业余的文艺活动上。这种活动已成为群众文化生活中的重要内容，群众自己教育自己的重要形式之一。我们的文艺就是由专业文艺活动与群众业余文艺活动两个部分组成的。现在，农村、部队、工厂中，业余剧团及其它各种文化娱乐组织是极普遍的。群众自编、自演、自唱，产生了许多优秀的创作。《不是蝉》、《六号门》两剧本以及工人创作的诗歌、绘画，特别表现了中国工人阶级在艺术创造上的天才。
    我们在文艺工作上所获得的每一个成绩，都是由于正确地执行了毛泽东文艺路线的结果。但比起中国人民的伟大斗争及其在各方面的成就来，文艺工作的成就还是太小了。这除了许多原因之外，一个最主要的原因是我们执行毛泽东文艺路线还是不够。毛泽东文艺路线，就是文艺上的阶级路线，群众路线。文艺要为人民服务，首先为工农兵服务，文艺工作者就必须与工农兵群众相结合；没有这种结合，文艺创造就断绝了源泉，文艺工作者本身的思想改造也失去了依据。
    毛泽东同志在他的伟大名著《实践论》中，最深刻而又最简要地说明了人的认识不能离开实践的这一个真理。他说：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实，变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”文艺是认识现实的手段之一。一个文艺工作者如果要真实地反映现实的话，就必须“亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争。”
    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，向文艺工作者作了这样的号召：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样地把原料与生产，把研究过程与创作过程统一起来。”这是一个带有根本性质的指示。我们的文艺工作者在口头上没有一个不拥护毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的，而且绝大多数人也是衷心拥护的；但在文艺工作者必须和工农兵群众相结合的这个根本问题上，却时常发生模糊，动摇和抵抗。毛泽东同志要我们“长期地、无条件地、全身心地”到群众斗争中去，而我们的有些文艺工作者却往往是“暂时地、有条件地、半身心地”。毛泽东同志要我们投入到群众的“火热的斗争”中去，而我们的有些文艺工作者却往往站在这个“火热的斗争”之外。有的文艺工作者甚至主张任何一种生活都有它的意义，不必特别地去追求群众斗争的生活，这样来使自己脱离群众，脱离实际的现状合理化。毛泽东同志要我们去“观察、体验、研究，分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式”，而我们的有些文艺工作者却把自己创作的眼界限制在非常狭小的范围内。文艺上的公式主义的特点，就是把本来是多方面的、复杂的、曲折的生活现象，理解成和描写成片面的，简单化的，直线的。公式主义者不按照生活的多样性而按照千篇一律的公式去观察和描写生活，不但把复杂的生活现象简单化，而且把真正的政治，即群众的政治庸俗化。另一方面，形式主义的特点，则是编造不现实的故事，绘声绘色，加以描写，以人为的、“戏剧性”的矛盾和曲折的情节来代替生活本身的辩证法，掩盖生活内容的空虚。公式主义和形式主义两者主要地都是来源于脱离实际，脱离群众。在文艺工作的某些部门，某些同志身上，是严重地存在着脱离实际，脱离群众的倾向的。这是目前文艺工作中最有害的倾向。
    我们的文艺工作者一旦脱离群众、脱离实际，他就必然受到各种资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的侵袭，而成为那些思想的俘虏。脱离群众、脱离实际，这种倾向本身，按照列宁的说法，就是“资本主义社会所遗留给我们的最大祸害之一”。我们的文艺既然要有益于工农兵，既然基本上是为他们服务，那末我们的文艺思想便不能是资产阶级或小资产阶级的，而必须是无产阶级的。因为只有无产阶级的思想、立场，才能正确地认识工农及其它一切阶级；只有用无产阶级的艺术方法（革命的现实主义的方法），才能正确地反映工农及其它一切阶级；也只有这样，才能保证文艺经常地和人民群众的需要，和实际斗争的需要相符合。因此，我们目前的首要任务，就是在整个文艺工作中贯彻执行毛泽东的文艺路线，和一切离开这个路线的倾向进行斗争。
  表现爱国主义的伟大主题
    毛泽东同志在“人民政协第一届全体会议上的开幕词”中说：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。中国从来就是一个伟大的勇敢的勤劳的民族，只是在近代是落伍了。这种落伍，完全是被外国帝国主义和本国反动政府所压迫和剥削的结果。……我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了”。这个庄严的宣告，就规定了中国人民在现代世界舞台上的正确地位。表现“站立起来了”的中国人民成为爱国主义文艺的中心主题。
    我们的文艺历来是爱国主义的，也就是说，历来是反对帝国主义侵略和封建主义压迫，充满了对一切侵略者、压迫者的仇恨和对自己民族命运的深刻关心的。现在中国人民推翻了国内外反动派在自己国土上的统治，建立了自己的政权——人民民主专政。中国人民当前的任务就是抗美援朝，继续反对帝国主义侵略；土地改革，彻底消灭封建主义；镇压和肃清反革命；恢复和发展生产，使中国摆脱过去历史所造成的经济上文化上的落后状况，而变为经济繁荣，文化发达的国家。中国人民正在为完成这些巨大的历史性的任务而奋斗。从来是勤劳、勇敢的中国人民，在长期革命斗争过程中，在人民民主制度下，经过锻炼、教育，日益提高了他们的觉悟程度。从他们中间不断涌现出新的人物，战场上、生产中，以及其它各种工作上的英雄模范。我们的文艺首先就要表现中国人民中的这些先进人物，表现中国民族与中国共产党的伟大力量，他们的高度的智慧和英雄主义。帝国主义、封建主义对中国人民长期残酷的黑暗统治，一方面造成了中国人民无限的革命毅力和决心，另一方面也在部分中国人身上造成了某种程度的民族自卑心，这种民族自卑心和中国资产阶级、小资产阶级所固有的动摇性、软弱性的特点是正好结合着的。文艺应当帮助人民扫清这种由于长期民族屈辱地位所造成的自卑心理，而建立起适应于我们今天国家地位的，伟大中国人民应有的民族自尊心，加强人民对自身伟大力量和光明前途的信念。可惜我们的文艺还未能完全做到这点。它还没有能够把“站立起来了”的中国人民的力量充分表现出来，它的人物常常是在“精神状态”上并没有站立起来，有时甚至在形象上也是弯腰曲背的。对于人民的敌人——帝国主义者、封建主义者及一切反革命分子的罪恶暴行，应当加以有力的揭露；但有些艺术作品却错误地把敌人的力量描写得超过人民的力量，甚至把帝国主义者侮辱我们中国人民的行为也津津有味地加以描写毫不感觉到损害自己民族的尊严。
    中国人民经过长期的艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于取得了今天的胜利，最后摆脱了过去生活的悲惨命运，开始建设自己的新的生活。旧的、黑暗的、悲惨的时代已经一去不复返了。而我们的有些艺术作品却仍停留在对过去悲惨生活的单纯的痛苦的回忆，而没有足够地描写出人民今天新的愉快的生活的实际和明天更美好的生活的远景。艺术作品记录人民充满血泪的生活和斗争的历史，是十分需要的，但不能让历史的痛苦回忆过分沉重地拖累着我们。
    我们的文艺作品描写了人民在斗争中改造自己的艰苦过程，这是十分需要的。这个改造过程将是长期的。文艺应当反映与推动这个改造过程，借以帮助人民逐步地提高到民主主义与社会主义的觉悟水平上去。但有些文艺作品却过分地热中于描写人民中的消极人物和刻划人民身上残留的落后因素，而不去或不善于描写人民中的积极人物和刻划人民身上正在产生的新的因素。有些作者到群众中间去常常只看到落后现象，因而被这些落后现象所迷惑，而不知道在一切运动中、一切斗争中经常起作用的，决定一切的，是进步的、积极的因素，而不是落后的、消极的因素。有些作者就在描写积极人物的时候，也不是着重去表现他们的新的高尚的品质，而往往努力去寻找他们灵魂深处的某些弱点或阴暗的方面。
    最近，《人民文学》第四卷第一期上发表的丁克辛的小说《老工人郭福山》，可以作为这样的一个例子。这篇小说写的是：郭福山的儿子郭占祥，一个被作者描写为一切方面都够模范的、“有能力，有威信，得到全支部党员的一致拥戴”的铁路工人领袖，又是工务段的支部书记，这样一个人物，在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争发生，敌机轰炸我国境的时候，忽然害怕起飞机来，成为了一个“怕飞机，怕轰炸，怕死的软骨头”。原来他过去曾被日本鬼子抓到北满去当劳工，有一夜，日本鬼子用机枪打死两百多劳工，他从死人堆里逃出来，从此他听到机枪的“哒哒哒……”声就害怕了。他的非党员的老父亲要求支部把他这个不肖的儿子开除出党，总支书记从宽处理，仅仅撤销了郭占祥的支部书记的职务。后来在他父亲的影响之下，他变成不怕飞机了，于是成了“父子英雄”。很显然的，作者不只歪曲地描写了一个模范的共产党员所应有的形象，而且完全抹杀了共产党的教育和领导的作用。似乎一个模范共产党员还不如一个普通老工人；似乎在最要紧的关头，决定一个人的行动的，不是他的政治觉悟的程度，而是由于某种原因所造成的生理上，心理上的缺陷和变态；似乎帝国主义者的凶暴行为竟可以把中国工人吓倒；似乎使一个共产党员改正错误的，不是党的教育，而是父亲的教育。在整个事件中，起决定作用的是生理的因素，而不是政治的因素；是家族的关系，而不是党的关系。这样的作品，在政治思想内容上说，是完全错误的，这难道还不明显吗？
    作为对照，同一《人民文学》第二卷第二期上寒风的小说《尹青春》，却有力地表现了人民战士的新的品质。主人公尹青春也是有缺点的，他犯了一点战场纪律，正因为这原故，他没有能够解决党籍问题。他痛苦，他争取入党的意志牢固地支配了他整个的生命。他经受起了一切考验。正如政治委员所形容他的：“他是‘铁人’。有人常是不怕敌人，而受不了自己身上来的困难，这个人是什么都不怕，放到什么地方都是硬的。”他最后立了功，入了党。在批准入党的时候，他说：“这是党给我的光荣。到困难关头，我一想到党就有了力量。要不我值得什么呢？”
    当一个战士单单为了保卫自己的家，保卫自己的一块土地而英勇战斗的时候，当一个农民单单为了发家致富而积极生产的时候，那末，还不能说他是新的人物。只有当一个人觉悟到能够为公共利益斗争，能够把国家和全体人民的利益放在个人的或家庭的利益之上的时候，这个人物才说得上是新的人物，他的品质才是新的品质。
    我们的文艺作品必须表现出新的人民的这种新的品质，表现共产党员的英雄形象，以他们的英勇事迹和模范行为，来教育广大群众和青年。这是目前文艺创作上头等重要的任务。
    爱国主义的另一面问题，就是如何对待历史的人物与传统的问题。毛泽东同志在《中国革命与中国共产党》一书中说道：“中华民族不但是以刻苦耐劳著称于世，同时又是酷爱自由富于革命传统的民族。……在中华民族的几千年的历史中，产生了很多的民族英雄与革命领袖。……所以中华民族又是一个有光荣革命传统和优秀历史遗产的民族”。我们对历代一切曾经推动历史前进的、有过对人民有益的创造的英雄人物，必须肯定和加以表扬。但是我们不容许把历史上的反动者描写为革命者，如《武训传》电影所做的，同时就在描写历史上的革命英雄的时候，我们的表扬和歌颂也不能是违背历史的。历史上任何出色的革命英雄都不能拿来和现代工人阶级的伟大领袖相比拟。那样的比拟，就是在原则上错误的。德国一位资产阶级作家路特维希和斯大林同志谈话的时候，曾提出把他和彼得大帝比拟。斯大林同志反对了这种历史上的比拟。他说要拿列宁和彼得大帝来相比的话，那么，“彼得大帝不过是沧海中的一滴，而列宁却是整个茫茫无际的海洋。”这就是我们在估价历史人物上的一个重要的原则。
  继承民族文学艺术的优良传统
    新的人民的文艺必须与我们自己民族文学艺术的优良传统衔接起来，发展与充实文艺创作的民族形式。
    我国的文学艺术遗产是十分丰富的。毛泽东同志在《新民主主义论》中说：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。因此清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸取其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化，提高民族自信心的必要条件。但是决不能无批判的兼收并蓄，必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的民间文化即多少带有民主性与革命性的东西区别开来。中国现时的新政治新经济是从古代的旧政治旧经济发展而来的，中国现时的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。”以为新文化是完全从西洋移植过来的，而不是在自己民族基础上发生的；以为发展民族新文化，可以不经过清理古代文化的发展过程的必要的批判工作，民族新文化可以和民族旧文化不打交代，这是割断历史的有害的看法。不少文艺工作者和青年们盲目崇拜西洋，轻视民族文学艺术传统，轻视民间形式，轻视群众的爱好和趣味，这也正是一种失掉民族自信心与缺乏群众观点的表现。这是文艺的普及和提高的严重障碍。当然，我们不是国粹主义者。我们必须向外国学习，特别是向苏联学习。社会主义现实主义的文学艺术是中国人民和广大知识青年的最有益的精神食粮，我们今后还要加强翻译介绍的工作。学习先进国家的经验，正是为了创造自己本国的经验；尊重别的民族的历史和文化传统，更要尊重自己民族的历史和文化传统，否则就不是真正的爱国主义者，也不是真正的国际主义者。真正的国际主义者，是不能自己两手空空的。我们在文学艺术上的技巧是十分不够的，需要学习与提高技巧。但是学习技巧不等于模仿西洋形式，而正是为了发展与丰富自己民族的形式。
    形式中最主要的因素是语言。斯大林同志说过：“以社会主义为内容的无产阶级文化，在参加社会主义建设的民族中间依照语言风俗等等的不同，而采取各种不同的表现形式和方法。”语言和风俗是必须从人民的实际生活中，从本国人民传统的文艺中去学习的。毛泽东同志把学习语言放在头等重要的地位。当然文艺形式的因素不只是语言，还有其它的因素，例如结构等等。语言简练自然。人物性格明确。情节发展交代明白，有头有尾。这是我国文艺的优良传统，值得我们学习的。我们的文艺必须克服不大众化的缺点，而文艺的大众化是与民族化分不开的。鲁迅说：“旧文学衰颓时，因为摄取民间文学或外国文学而起一个新的转变，这例子是常见于文学史上的。”这个新的转变已经在中国发生。这就是从“五四”到“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，中国新文艺的发展过程和道路。我们要以一切努力来加速完成这个转变。
    要继承民族艺术的优良传统，一方面必须广泛地进行搜集、整理、研究工作，另一方面必须首先对于目前在群众中最流行的旧有艺术形式进行改革的工作。
    中国戏剧遗产非常丰富，其中保存了许多优秀的历史故事和传说神话，这种戏曲形式至今为广大人民所喜爱。全国戏曲形式的种类是极多的。各种地方戏都带有各地方的语言、音乐和风俗的特色。对各种地方戏、民间小戏和曲艺应普遍地加以发掘、研究和改造，使之在新的基础上得到发展。依照毛泽东同志的指示与最近中央人民政府政务院“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”，戏曲改革工作的主要方针，就是鼓励各种戏曲形式的自由竞赛，以达到“百花齐放，推陈出新”。在音乐方面，应继续加强民间音乐的研究工作，并注意中国的戏曲音乐，说唱音乐及中国民族器乐的研究与改造。中国各兄弟民族的舞蹈是丰富的，而且健康的，应当广泛地加以采集和发展。绘画方面，应当继承与发展中国绘画的正确传统。中国文学遗产的整理研究工作是最艰巨的，首先需要做的是中国近代文学史与现代文学史的研究工作。
    我们尊重自己民族的文学艺术遗产，不是采取盲目赞扬的态度，而是采取严格的科学的批判的态度。我们从全部遗产中，只“吸取其民主性的精华”，而断然“剔除其封建性的糟粕”；把这“民主性的精华”部分，作为优良传统接受下来，并在新的基础上加以发展。我们不把民族形式看成固定不变的，而把民族形式看成发展的，在实践过程中不断改造和革新的。我们在艺术问题上，如同在其他一切问题上一样，是发展的观点，而不是保守的观点。我们整个文艺工作的任务，主要的不是保存民族旧文学、旧艺术，而是发展民族新文学、新艺术。从事戏曲改革的同志应特别注意防止封建的毒素从各方面来的传染，要坚决改革旧有戏曲中反动的封建的内容，同时也要改革与那些内容血肉相联的一切腐朽的、落后的形式。只有这样，才能完成“推陈出新”的任务。
    正确地解决了继承自己民族文学艺术的优良传统的问题，我们的新文艺就将在广大人民中更深入地发展。
  加强文艺工作上的批评与自我批评，克服自由主义的作风和庸俗
        习气
    今天中国的文学艺术是统一战线的，它包括工人、农民、小资产阶级、资产阶级的各种不同思想和倾向，但必须以工人阶级的思想，马列主义和毛泽东思想作为指导的方向。一切共产党员的和革命的文艺工作者必须努力提高马列主义知识的修养水平，这是提高文艺的思想性、艺术性、战斗性的先决条件。我们必须用马列主义的观点、方法，而不是用任何其它的观点、方法，在文艺战线上首先扫清帝国主义、封建主义的思想影响，同时对资产阶级、小资产阶级、以及农民的一切错误思想进行批判。特别对于那些披着马列主义外衣的资产阶级、小资产阶级的反动思想要彻底地加以揭露。关于武训和《武训传》电影的论战，暴露了我们在思想工作和文艺工作上的一种严重状态，就是我们许多同志在新的环境下政治上思想上变得麻痹起来，开始失去一个共产党员所应有的思想上的锐敏，失去对敌对的和错误的思想的辨别与批判的能力。这种状态是和我们许多文艺工作者中间所存在的自由主义作风有关系的；从领导责任上说，又是和我们文艺工作的领导上所存在的事务主义的作风有关系的。
    必须克服在文艺的领导工作上的事务主义作风。事务主义的领导就是一种无思想的领导。它不注意从政治上思想上去领导文艺事业，不关心创作和批评的活动，习惯于以简单的行政方法代替细致的思想工作。
    必须克服文艺工作者中间存在的自由主义作风与庸俗习气。这些作风和习气表现在：对一切敌对的和错误的思想不批评、不斗争，与之和平共居，甚至随声附和，不喜欢听批评，用各种借口拒绝批评；在文艺工作者相互关系上，讲交情，讲面子，不建立正确的原则的关系；把严肃的思想斗争庸俗化。
    要克服以上一切恶劣作风，最主要的方法就是开展文艺工作上的批评与自我批评。文艺批评，是实现文艺工作中党的领导的重要工具。必须进一步提高批评的政治思想内容，并使之与对具体作品的艺术分析结合起来。批评一方面要对文艺上的一切不良倾向进行斗争，另一方面又要注意发现文艺上的新的力量，新的成果和新的经验，加以提倡表扬。
    在毛泽东文艺方向之下，在党中央和毛泽东同志个人对文艺工作的经常关心和指导之下，我们文艺工作的缺点是能够克服的。克服缺点，继续前进。为在整个文艺战线上贯彻执行毛泽东文艺路线而继续斗争吧！
