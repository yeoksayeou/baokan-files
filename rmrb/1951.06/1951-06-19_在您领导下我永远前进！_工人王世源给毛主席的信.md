　　Forever Moving Forward Under Your Leadership!
    ——Worker Wang Shiyuan's Letter to Chairman Mao
    Respected Chairman Mao:
　　Under your wise leadership, I am forever maintaining progress. As the 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching, I am writing to report to you about my work over the past year. I joined the Party last May. Through the Party's cultivation and education for over a year, my political and technical level has improved. In the past year, I have used my brain to improve twelve kinds of production tools, which has improved production efficiency. The main ones are these: (1) Improved the seasoning machine, which increased production efficiency by ten times, ensuring the completion of the production plan on schedule. (2) Manufactured copper sleeve oil grooves. In the past, it was done by hand, making 65 pieces per shift. After improving the tool, 1,200 pieces can be made per shift. And improved the quality standards of these products. In addition, I give lectures on technical knowledge to young workers to help them improve their technical level.
　　Now, all the workers in our factory are launching a production increase and donation campaign, working one extra shift each month, using the increased production, rationalization proposals, and bonuses earned from creating new records to purchase airplanes and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. All the Communist Party members and all the workers in the factory have also re-seriously signed patriotic pledges, launched a patriotic labor emulation campaign in the workshop, and continue to improve product quality. In order to make this labor emulation campaign a success, I will improve more tools and increase production efficiency to create more wealth for the country. At the same time, I will actively participate in trade union work to promote the patriotic labor emulation campaign. I will help young workers learn technology and teach them all my 20 years of technical experience.

　　在您领导下我永远前进！
    ——工人王世源给毛主席的信敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的英明领导下，我永远保持着前进。党的三十周年纪念日即将来了，我特向你报告一年来的工作。我是去年五月入党的。一年多经党的培养、教育，我的政治和技术水平，都有了提高。一年来我开动脑筋，改进了十二种生产工具，提高了生产效率。主要的有这几种：（一）改进了调料机，使生产效率提高十倍；保证了生产计划的如期完成。（二）制造铜套拉油糟，过去用手工作，每工做六十五个。改进工具后，每工就能做一千二百个。并提高了这些产品的质量标准。另外给青年工人讲技术常识，帮助青年工人提高技术水平。
    现在我们全工厂职工正展开增产捐献运动，每月义务加班一天，用增加生产，开展合理化建议，创造新记录所得的奖金购买飞机、大炮支援中国人民志愿军。全厂共产党员和全体职工又重新认真的订了爱国公约，开展了车间爱国主义劳动竞赛，继续提高产品质量。为了使这一劳动竞赛获得成功，我要更多的改进工具，提高生产效率，为国家创造更多的财富。同时积极参加工会工作，推进爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。帮助青年工人学习技术，要把我二十多年的技术经验，全部教给青年工人。
