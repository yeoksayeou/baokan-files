The Inseparability of Combat Enthusiasm and Organizational Discipline

——A Critique of "Flowers of Glory of the Motherland" Regarding the Depiction of Heroic Images of People's Soldiers
Yi Bing

The People's Daily published a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Korea on May 17th, titled "Flowers of Glory of the Motherland," written by Ai Zhi. This dispatch originally appeared in the Northeast Daily. The dispatch describes a machine gun squad leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Shan Yulin, who, in order to defend the motherland and avenge the Korean people, insisted on fighting while ill, bravely and tenaciously killing more than twenty American devils; finally, when his gun broke, he even used a digging pickaxe to kill two American devils. Undoubtedly, this revolutionary heroic deed, which demonstrates a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, is very moving and gives the people of the motherland tremendous encouragement. However, in this dispatch, the author, while emphasizing the combat enthusiasm of our Volunteer Army soldiers, neglects the high degree of organization and discipline of our Volunteer Army. It should be pointed out that this high degree of organization and discipline is an important source of the combat effectiveness of our Volunteer Army. The author uses Shan Yulin, a character so stubborn that he disobeys the organization and lacks respect for his superiors, to illustrate the general situation of our Volunteer Army's heroic combat, which is by no means a typical image of our Volunteer Army's heroic soldiers, nor is it sufficient to explain the essence and source of the heroic behavior of our Volunteer Army soldiers. Please see the author's description:

Comrade Shan Yulin went to the hospital for recuperation due to illness, but sneaked back to the unit without the hospital's permission. The company commander asked him, "Then why did you come back?" The author writes, "This question stumped Shan Yulin. If he answered, there would be too many people around; if he didn't answer, the company commander was waiting for an answer. So he decided not to answer, just said 'I'll tell you later,' and turned and left..." (Emphasis added by me - Yi Bing)

The political instructor and company commander brought him back.

"‘Old Shan, you can't sneak away! How can you participate in combat if you're not well?’ the company commander said. ‘You should go back!’

"‘Comrades are all fighting, how can I recuperate?’

"Shan Yulin was afraid that the company commander and political instructor would force him to go back, so he left after speaking. The political instructor shouted 'Come back!' several times, but couldn't stop him."

Is this the combat enthusiasm we want to praise? Should the combat enthusiasm of our Volunteer Army's heroic soldiers be expressed in this way?

In the book "Ivan Nikulin - Russian Sailor" by the Soviet writer Solovyov, the eagerness of the soldier Nikulin to return to the front line while ill is no less than that of Shan Yulin. However, due to the different depth of the author's thinking and understanding of the soldiers, the impression given by his works is also different. Now, we might as well copy the passage of Nikulin asking to go to the battlefield for comparison:

"‘I don't want any medicine!’ Nikulin pleaded, ‘Please allow me to be discharged from the hospital early. I can heal myself on the front line. I can't bear it here anymore. My heart is burning...’

"‘How pitiful!’ Sergei Dmitrievich said with mocking sympathy in his tone. ‘You have insomnia and heart pain - to be honest, you will be discharged as disabled.’ He suddenly shouted loudly: ‘Enough talk! Do you need to come here to teach me? When to allow someone to be discharged, I know myself! Go to the garden and take a walk!’

"From then on, they repeated such conversations every week. Nikulin asked to be discharged, and Sergei Dmitrievich firmly refused."

From here we see a soldier who actively asks to fight but has a high degree of organization and abides by hospital rules, rather than a soldier who sneaks back to the front line.

When Shan Yulin spoke with the company commander and political instructor, his attitude towards his superiors was: "‘I'll tell you later,’ and turned and left," and "The political instructor shouted 'Come back!' several times, but couldn't stop him." What is the purpose of describing this arrogant behavior? Is this the typical image of a people's soldier with a high degree of class consciousness? Is it that a soldier's bravery and tenacity must come from a lack of organizational discipline? Is it necessary to explain the heroic behavior of the Volunteer Army soldiers through such an unreasonable and casual person? In fact, anyone who truly knows the Volunteer Army will deny this. Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army is the world's most tenacious and resourceful force, which is entirely correct, but this bravery and tenacity are inseparable from the high degree of organization and discipline built on the foundation of high political consciousness. Moreover, precisely because of this high degree of organization and discipline, the combat enthusiasm and revolutionary heroism of the Volunteer Army's heroic soldiers can be better manifested.

The era of writing about "individual heroes" has passed, and it is inappropriate to portray our heroic people's soldiers as "individual heroes" who disobey the organization. This will give people an extremely wrong feeling and lead to an incorrect view of the Volunteer Army - this new type of people's heroic force.

In addition, let's look at the author's description of the commanders: "Why did you run back? Is the hospital not good?" and later the political instructor and company commander's suspicion:

"Old Shan probably violated discipline in the hospital, right?"

"No, how could Old Shan violate discipline?"

"Then why is his illness not getting better, and the hospital told him to leave?"

Obviously, it is also inappropriate to describe the commanders' speculation about the hospitals of the People's Volunteer Army in this way.

I have read many dispatches by the author Ai Zhi, and many of them are well-written; however, in this dispatch, certain descriptions about Shan Yulin show that the author's understanding of the people's soldiers of our Volunteer Army is not yet profound, and that she lacks a correct understanding of the revolutionary heroic image of the People's Volunteer Army.

　　作战的积极性和组织性纪律性不可分
    ——评“祖国的光荣之花”关于人民战士英雄形象的描写
    一兵
    人民日报五月十七日刊登了一篇新华社的朝鲜通讯，题目是“祖国的光荣之花”，作者是爱芝。这篇通讯原载东北日报。通讯中描写中国人民志愿军的一个机枪班长——单雨林，为了保卫祖国，为了替朝鲜人民报仇，带病坚持作战，英勇顽强地杀死二十多个美国鬼子；最后枪坏了，又用挖工事的镐头砍死了两个美国鬼子。毫无疑问，这种表现了高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神的革命英雄事迹，是很动人的，它给了祖国人民以莫大的鼓舞。但是，在这篇通讯中，作者在强调我志愿军战士作战的积极性时。忽视了我志愿军的高度的组织性和纪律性。应该指出：这种高度的组织性和纪律性，是我志愿部队战斗力的重要源泉。作者以一个个性倔强到不服从组织和对上级不够尊重的单雨林，来说明我志愿军英勇作战的一般情况，这绝不是我志愿军英雄战士的典型形象，也不足以说明我志愿军战士英雄行为的本质和来源。请看作者的叙述：
    单雨林同志因病去医院修养，没有经过医院的许可就偷跑回部队。连长问他：“那你为什么回来呢？”作者写道：“这一问把单雨林难住了。他要回答吧，周围人太多了；要不回答吧，连长正在等待回答。于是他决定不回答，只说了声‘一会再说’，便扭头走了。……”（旁点是我加的——一兵）
    指导员和连长把他找回来了。
    “‘老单，那你也不能偷跑！你的病不好怎能参加战斗呢？’连长说：‘你还是回去吧！’
    “‘同志们都在战斗，叫我休养怎行？’
    “单雨林怕连长指导员再逼他回去，说完便走了。指导员一连喊了好几个‘回来！’也没有喊住他。”
    这就是我们要表扬的作战积极性吗？我们志愿部队英勇战士的作战积极性，应该如此来表现吗？
    在苏联梭罗维约夫所著的《伊万·尼古林——俄罗斯的水兵》一书里，战士尼古林要求带病回前线的迫切心情，与单雨林比，是不相上下的。但由于作者的思想深度不同，对战士的了解不同，其作品给人的印象也就不同。现在，我们不妨把尼古林要求上战场的一段抄下来比较比较：
    “‘我不要什么药！’尼古林恳求说，‘请您准许我早出院。我在前线上可以治好。我在这儿再也忍耐不下去了。心像烧的一样……’
    “‘真可怜！’谢尔盖·狄米特里耶维支声调里表示着嘲讽的同情说，‘您失眠，心脏又疼——说老实话，您要因为残废退伍啦。’他忽然大声喊叫：‘话说够啦！还用您到这儿来教训我。什么时候准许什么人出院啦，我自己知道！到花园里去，散散心去！’
    “从那时起，他们之间每星期都要重复这样的谈话。尼古林要求出院，谢尔盖·狄米特里耶维支坚决拒绝。”
    从这里我们看到了一个积极要求作战但是具有高度组织性、守院规的战士，而不是私自跑回前线的战士。
    单雨林与连长、指导员谈话时，他对上级的态度是：“‘一会再说’，便扭头走了。”及“指导员一连喊了好几个‘回来！’也没有喊住他”。描写这种傲慢的行为，为了说明什么呢？难道这就是具有高度阶级觉悟的人民战士的典型形象吗？难道一个战士的英勇顽强，就该是组织性纪律性不强吗？是不是必须通过这样一个蛮不讲理，随随便便的人才能说明志愿军战士的英雄行为呢？其实，只要真正认识志愿军的人，他都会否定这一点的。我们中国人民志愿军是世界上头等顽强机智的部队，这是完全对的，但这种英勇顽强是和建筑在高度政治觉悟基础上的高度的组织性和纪律性分不开的。而且正由于有了这种高度的组织性和纪律性，志愿军英勇战士在战斗上的积极性和革命英雄主义，才能更好地表现出来。
    写“个人英雄”的时代已经过去了，把我们英雄的人民战士写成不服从组织的“个人英雄”的形象，是不洽当的。这样会给人以极其错误的感觉，会使人对于志愿部队——这种新型的人民英雄部队以不正确的看法。
    另外，我们看作者描写指挥员的地方：“你为什么跑回来？是医院不好吗？”以及后来指导员和连长怀疑：
    “老单大概在医院犯了纪律了吧？”
    “不会，老单那能犯纪律呢？”
    “那他为什么病还不好，医院就叫他出院了呢？”
    显然，这样描写指挥员对于人民志愿部队医院的猜测也是不妥当的。
    我曾读过作者爱芝的不少通讯，有许多通讯是写得好的；但是，在这篇通讯中，关于单雨林的某些描写，说明了作者对我们志愿部队的人民战士的了解还不深刻，对于人民志愿部队革命的英雄形象还缺乏正确的了解。
