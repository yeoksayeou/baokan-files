　　Wu Xun's "Promoting Education" Harms the Interests of the Laboring People
To the Editor:
    Mr. Xiao Zou believes that "it would be better if Wu Xun could have made revolution like Hong Xiuquan; otherwise, it doesn't matter if he honestly runs schools for poor children." This is an extremely muddled statement. Wu Xun's running schools was definitely not for "poor children," but to cultivate slaves for the feudal ruling class, for the benefit of the feudal rulers who ride on the heads of poor children and "whose sons and grandsons sit in eight-carried palanquins." This is very clear. Therefore, Wu Xun's actions were counter-revolutionary actions to maintain feudal rule and cannot be compared with the peasant revolution at that time. What Mr. Xiao Zou said about Wu Xun "honestly" "running schools" is also "honestly" serving the feudal rulers at that time. I think Mr. Xiao Zou's theory is very wrong.

### 武训的“兴学”是损害劳动人民利益的

　　武训的“兴学”是损害劳动人民利益的编辑同志：
    萧奏先生认为“武训如果能够像洪秀全那样闹革命当然更好，否则，老老实实地为穷孩子们办学校也没有关系。”这是一个极糊涂的说法。武训办学校决不是为“穷孩子”，而是为了替封建统治阶级培养奴才，是为了骑在穷孩子头上、“子子孙孙坐八抬大轿”的封建统治者的利益。这一点是很明白的。因此，武训的行动是维护封建统治的反革命行动，与当时的农民革命决不能相提并论。萧奏先生所说武训“老老实实”“办学”，也就是“老老实实”为当时封建统治者服务。我认为萧奏先生的理论是很错误的。
