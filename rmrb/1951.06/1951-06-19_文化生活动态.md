            The People's University Hospital Implements Tissue Fluid Injection Treatment
    The People's University Hospital has achieved preliminary success in applying tissue fluid injection treatment. The hospital began work on tissue therapy in March this year. In a short period of just over two months, they have simplified the tissue therapy procedure to the point where injections can be performed under the simplest equipment conditions. From May onwards, the hospital is responsible for manufacturing the tissue fluid, while the injection work is carried out by the outpatient department. Experience has shown that the therapeutic effect of tissue fluid injection is no less than that of tissue implantation and refrigerated skin grafting, and the procedure is extremely simple. This tissue fluid is extracted from the placenta, amniotic membrane, and umbilical cord of postpartum women and appears as a greyish milky substance. It is stored in small bottles with rubber stoppers. From May 7th to the present, the hospital has used tissue fluid to treat more than 70 patients, with good results.
