　　China National Cereals Corporation Beijing Branch
    Does a Good Job in Grain Storage
    The Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee issued a circular commending the China National Cereals Corporation Beijing Branch for its grain storage work. The company's grain storage work has done well in the following three aspects:
    (1) Overfulfilled the grain drying task ahead of schedule. This spring, the company received and stored a lot of wet grain, and the amount of dried grain was ten times greater than last year. The China National Cereals Corporation instructed that it must be dried before June 6 (Grain in Ear). Under such arduous and urgent tasks, it was able to formulate plans in a timely manner, make preparations, and mobilize cadres and workers to jointly create experience, improve methods, and give play to the enthusiasm of work. By the end of May, all the grain had been dried and put into storage. Not only was the time advanced, but also more than 18 million catties of Northeast corn were dried, ensuring that there would be no loss due to mold and rot due to excessive grain moisture this summer.
    (2) Saved a lot of expenses. This year, the company changed the way of storing grain in open-air stacks, saving a large number of packaging supplies such as sacks, sleepers, and mats. It also changed to drying on the original vehicle on the spot, spreading thinly and turning frequently, and drying into piles at one time, which reduced costs, labor, and time. The ground coverings for drying grain were all made of old mats. Waste products were disposed of in a timely manner and exchanged for funds. In addition, according to the specific conditions of each warehouse, the rational storage, transportation and allocation of grain seeds greatly reduced the storage cost of grain. As of the end of May, a total of more than 16.7 billion yuan had been saved.
    (3) Improved storage technology and management methods. In terms of storage technology, the company created multi-hole ventilation stacks to reduce grain moisture. The use of scientific instruments and the creation of stack cards have improved the efficiency of daily inspection and storage. And select all types of stacks, check and record them daily, to find storage rules. In terms of management, a zoning and sub-platform responsibility system is adopted to determine the work responsibilities of cadres. It can also unite and rely on workers, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of workers. Warehouse appliances can also be rationally stored and used, accelerating the turnover rate of use, which has been very effective.
    Grain storage is a very heavy task. Under the current situation that warehouse equipment conditions are still simple, the company's personnel at all levels can come up with ways, overcome difficulties, and continuously improve their work, so that the people's property is not damaged, which should be commended.

　　中国粮食公司北京市公司
    粮食保管工作做得好
    北京市人民政府人民监察委员会发出通报，表扬中国粮食公司北京市公司粮食保管工作。该公司粮食保管工作有以下三项作得很好：
    （一）提前超额完成晒粮任务。该公司本年春季收储湿粮很多，晒干的数量，较去年增大十倍。中国粮食公司指示，务必在六月六日（芒种）以前晒干。在这样繁重紧急的任务之下，能及时订出计划，作好准备，并发动干部工人，共同创造经验，改进方法，发挥工作的积极性，到五月下旬，即已全部晒干入库。不仅时间提前，并超过原计划多晒干了东北玉米一千八百余万斤，保证今年夏季不致因粮食湿度太大而受到霉烂的损失。
    （二）大量节省开支。该公司本年改变露天储粮囤垛的方式，节省了大量麻袋、枕木、席子等包装用品，又改用原车就地晒晾，薄摊勤翻，一次晒干入囤等方法，减少了费用、工力和时间。晒粮铺地用品，一律利用旧席。并及时处理废品，换回资金。又根据各库具体条件，合理储运及调拨粮种，都大大地降低了粮食的保管成本。总计五月底已节省资金一百六十七亿余元。
    （三）改进保管技术与管理方法。该公司在保管技术方面，曾创造多孔通风垛，减低储粮水份。使用科学仪器，创设囤垛卡片，提高了平时检查与保管的效能。并选择各类型囤垛，逐日检查纪录，以寻求保管规律。管理方面，采用分区及分台负责制，确定干部的工作责任。并能团结与依靠工人，发挥了工人的积极性和创造性。仓库用具，亦能合理保管使用，加速使用的周转率，收效都很大。
    粮食保管，是十分繁重的工作，在目前仓库设备条件尚属简陋的情况下，该公司各级人员，能想出办法，能克服困难，并不断改进工作，使人民资财，不受损害，这是应该表扬的。
