　　"The Life of Wu Xun" Awakened Me
    Tian Han
    Returning to Tianjin from Korea, I encountered the discussion in the ideological circles of the motherland regarding the film "The Life of Wu Xun." A figure whom I had thought was good for many years, and a film that had moved me in the past, once illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, revealed its true form and had nowhere to hide. I have already seen dozens of articles from various parties examining the matter, and through this in-depth investigation and thorough exploration of this specific issue, our study of Marxism-Leninism has indeed taken a step forward.
    First is the question of who represents the "highest embodiment of the Chinese people's diligence, courage, and wisdom." Can Wu Xun, who solved almost everything by "kowtowing," represent the Chinese people's qualities of diligence, courage, and wisdom? If Wu Xun deserves such praise, then what about today's Chinese People's Volunteer Army? Isn't the spirit manifested by today's Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is precisely the opposite of the so-called "Wu Xun spirit," actually the "slave spirit"? Only the Chinese People's Volunteer Army truly represents the highest embodiment of the Chinese people's diligence, courage, and wisdom. We have not yet been able to vividly and powerfully portray and eulogize such a fighting model through film or other art forms, but we have wasted our energy praising those who should not be praised, spreading extremely harmful influences. It is truly something we should deeply regret and repent!
    The reason why Wu Xun was once valued, and even regarded as a figure after Confucius, is because he was deprived of the opportunity to receive education from a young age, and was thus subjected to deception and trampling. Therefore, he made a determined effort to beg for alms to establish schools, as if his personal pitiful efforts alone could improve the fate of poor children. It is precisely on this point that it catered to the pitiful fantasies of those reformists who advocated "education to save the nation." This involves a very old political line issue: "education to save the nation" or fundamentally solving the education problem through revolutionary struggle? The reformist fantasy of "education to save the nation" has long been bankrupt in China; the same situation has occurred in Korea. Before liberation, due to the Japanese imperialists' widespread implementation of enslavement education and restriction of the Korean people's right to enjoy primary education, the number of people without education reached more than 86 percent of the total population, with more than 2.56 million illiterate people under the age of 50. At that time, some Korean national reformists also put forward slogans such as "universal education" to replace the independence movement, attempting to engage in popularizing education within the pitiful limits allowed by the Japanese rulers. In the years of continuous and brutal struggle between the increasingly awakened Korean people and Japanese imperialism after the great "March 1st" uprising in 1919, these national reformists dared not touch a hair of the Japanese's sinful rule, and used various deceptive tricks to blur and weaken the Korean people's national consciousness and anti-imperialist sentiment. These "Korean Wu Xuns" contributed nothing to the improvement of the cultural and educational status of Korea other than playing the above-mentioned shameful role. Their masters were determined not to let the Korean people truly gain knowledge and progress. It was not until after the liberation of North Korea on "August 15th" that these dark days ended, and the possibility and conditions to solve the people's education problem began to exist.
    First of all, we vigorously eliminated the remnants of Japanese imperialist enslavement education ideologically, and advocated new patriotic and internationalist education. From the central government to the local level, committees for eliminating illiteracy were established, and Korean language schools and adult schools were established in factories, farms, and fishing villages throughout the region. Illiteracy in North Korea has been basically eliminated. Education funding has been increased to 23 percent of the country's total budget (only 1.3 percent during the Japanese rule). North Korea, which originally had no universities, has seen the emergence of Kim Il-sung University and 15 other universities, 55 higher technical vocational schools, 14 normal schools, and 24 junior technical schools in just five years. There are 20 times more junior high schools than before liberation, and more than 170 high schools, with a total of more than 4,000 new school buildings, and more than 33,000 educational cadres have been trained. Could such rapid and brilliant achievements be obtained by kowtowing to the imperialist rulers?
    This is my current understanding and view. In the past, I also mistakenly wrote a poem praising Wu Xun. Because I am a friend of Mr. Tao Xingzhi, I have always supported the educational cause he supports in the same way. He once praised Wu Xun, so I blindly followed and praised him without much deep consideration. This is enough to show that my liberalism and unserious work style, which still exist seriously even today. I should deeply regret and be vigilant.
    Wu Xun, with his years of asceticism, is very easy to confuse people, making people only sympathize with the suffering of his actions, and forgetting who he suffered for! This is precisely the terrible part of Wu Xun. The creators of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" have greatly beautified his asceticism and added a "revolutionary" color, which makes it even easier to confuse people. But this kind of inappropriate praise of historical figures and dishonest style in artistic creation is worth the vigilance of every author, and we must deeply remember this lesson.
    Finally, I thought about how to correctly understand and express historical figures in artistic creation, especially in opera creation, which is a very important issue. There are many old operas that praise and eulogize feudal slaves, such as "Huang Tianba." I hope that comrades in the opera circles will attach importance to and actively participate in the discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun." According to the instructions on opera reform work recently issued by the Government Administration Council, conduct serious and profound inspections of the old opera programs and performance methods in connection with your own thinking. In this way, we will surely be able to raise our opera circles a step forward ideologically in this discussion of "The Life of Wu Xun."

### 《武训传》使我猛醒

　　《武训传》使我猛醒
    田汉
    从朝鲜回到天津，就逢祖国思想界展开了关于电影《武训传》的讨论，多年来以为不错的人物，和看过去还颇受感动的影片，一旦经毛泽东思想的光芒照耀，便原身毕露、无所遁形。各方检讨文字单就我所看到的已经有数十篇之多，通过这一具体问题上的深入考察，寻根究底，的确把我们对马列主义的学习提高了一步。
    首先是谁代表了“中国人民勤劳、英勇、智慧的最高典型”的问题。那样几乎一切靠“磕头”来解决问题的武训能代表中国人民勤劳、英勇、智慧的品质吗？倘使武训值得那样的赞词，那又何以处今天的中国人民志愿部队呢？今天中国人民志愿部队所表现的精神品质与所谓“武训精神”实际就是“奴才精神”不正是恰恰相反的吗？只有中国人民志愿部队才真正代表了中国人民勤劳、英勇、智慧的最高典型，我们迄今还没有能通过电影或其他艺术形式十分生动有力地刻划和歌颂这样的战斗的典型，却浪费我们的笔墨歌颂了那些不应该歌颂的对象，传播极端有害的影响，真是应该痛自悔改的事！
    武训之所以一度被人重视，甚至被人当作孔子以后的人物看待，是由于他从小被剥夺了受教育的机会，以致备受欺骗践踏，因而一朝发愤，行乞兴学，仿佛单凭他个人这种可怜的努力就可改善穷孩子们的运命，正是在这一点上，投合了那些“教育救国”的改良主义者的可怜的幻想。这里便涉及一个已经十分陈旧的政治路线问题：还是“教育救国”呢？还是通过革命斗争来根本解决教育问题呢？“教育救国”的改良主义幻想，在中国早已破产了；在朝鲜也有过同样的情形。朝鲜在解放前由于日帝广施奴化教育，限制朝鲜人民享受初等教育权利，以致失学者达其全人口百分之八十六以上，五十岁以下的文盲二百五十六万人之多。当时朝鲜的一些民族改良主义者也曾提出“普及教育”等口号来代替独立运动。企图在日本统治者所允许的可怜的限度内来从事普及教育。在一九一九年伟大的“三、一”暴动之后，日益醒觉的朝鲜人民与日本帝国主义作不断的残酷斗争的年月，这些民族改良主义者不敢去触动日本罪恶统治的毫发，而用各种欺骗的花样来模糊、削弱朝鲜人民的民族觉悟与反帝情绪。这些“朝鲜的武训”们除起了上述的可耻作用之外对朝鲜文化教育状态的改善没有任何贡献。他的主子们决意不让朝鲜人民真能获得知识进步。直到“八、一五”北朝鲜人民解放以后，才结束了这种黑暗的日子，开始有了可能与条件来解决人民教育的问题。
    首先从思想上大力肃清了日本帝国主义奴化教育的残余，提倡新爱国主义国际主义的教育。从中央到地方都设立了肃清文盲委员会，朝鲜语文学校，成人学校遍布各地方的工厂，农庄和渔村。北朝鲜的文盲已基本肃清。教育经费提高到占国家整个预算的百分之二十三（日本统治时期只占百分之一、三）原来一个大学也没有的北朝鲜，短短五年间出现了规模壮大的金日成大学以下十五个大学，五十五个高等技术专科学校，十四个师范学校，二十四个初级技术学校。初级中学比解放前多二十倍，高中一百七十多个，增建校舍共达四千多所，训练出教育干部三万三千余名。这样迅速而辉煌的成就岂是向帝国主义统治者磕头所能获得的？
    这是我现在的认识和看法。过去我也曾经错误地写过一首歌颂武训的题诗。因我跟陶行知先生是知友，对于他所支持的教育事业我从来一样支持，他曾经赞扬过武训，我也就盲目地跟着赞扬一番而不甚深考，这都足以说明我当时甚至今日还严重存在的自由主义和不严肃作风。我应该深自愧悔、深自警惕。
    武训这个人物，由其长年苦行，极容易迷感人，使人只同情其行之苦，而忘了他为谁辛苦！这正是武训这个人物的可怕处。《武训传》电影的制作者们又把他的苦行大大加以美化，并加上“革命”的色彩，这就越发容易迷惑人了。但这一种对历史人物的不适当的歌颂与艺术创作上的不老实的作风是值得我们每一个作者警惕的，我们得深刻记住这个教训。
    最后我想到如何正确地认识与表现历史人物在艺术创作上，特别在戏曲创作上，是一个十分重要的问题。旧戏曲中有不少表扬与歌颂封建奴才的，如“黄天霸”之类。我希望，戏曲界的同志们重视并且积极参加《武训传》的讨论。根据不久以前政务院颁布的关于戏曲改革工作的指示，对于旧有戏曲节目及表演方法联系自己思想，进行认真的深刻的检查。这样，就一定能使我们戏曲界在这次《武训传》讨论中，在思想上提高一步。
