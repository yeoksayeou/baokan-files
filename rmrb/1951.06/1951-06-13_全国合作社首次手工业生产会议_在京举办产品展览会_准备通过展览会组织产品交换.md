The Product Exhibition of Local Handicraft Production Cooperatives and Processing Enterprises, organized by the National Cooperative's First Handicraft Production Work Conference, opened in Beijing on June 10th. A total of 700+ products from 101 production units in North China, East China, Central South, Northeast, Northwest, and other regions are participating in the exhibition.

Most of these products serve agricultural production. For example, the new-style agricultural implements made by the Dalian Cooperative's farm tool factory, various hammers, shovels, and sickles produced by the Shanxi Iron Production Cooperative, and sprayers produced by the Tangshan Special District Cooperative's directly-affiliated iron factory are all essential for agricultural production. Some products, such as various belts produced by the Tianjin Cotton Weaving Wheel Belt Cooperative and pine rosin produced in the Central South region, are closely related to industrial production.

In addition, a large proportion of products are supplied for people's consumption. Various iron beds and bicycles produced by the Shanghai Iron Bed Vehicle Production Cooperative, Cooperation brand shirts produced by the Shanghai First Shirt Sewing Cooperative, raincoats and children's clothing produced by the Second Garment Production Cooperative, various native cloths supervised by the Subei Nantong Cooperative, pottery produced by the Boshan Cooperative Kiln, fur coats and blankets produced by the Northwest Pingliang and other production cooperatives, and various radio receivers produced by the Beijing Electrical Equipment Production Cooperative are all exquisite and practical necessities of life.

The exhibition is scheduled to last for fifteen days. In addition to mutual observation and exchange of production experience, it is also planned to organize exchanges through the exhibition. Before the exhibition opened, some people had already requested samples or started placing orders for some products. The hospital beds produced by the Shanghai Iron Bed Vehicle Production Cooperative have already been ordered by a unit in the Northeast for 1,200 units.

　　全国合作社首次手工业生产会议       
    在京举办产品展览会
    准备通过展览会组织产品交换
    全国合作社第一次手工业生产工作会议所举办的各地手工业生产合作社和加工企业产品展览会，六月十日在北京开幕。参加展览产品的有华北、华东、中南、东北、西北等区的一百零一个生产单位，展览的产品共有七百多种。
    这些产品中，多数是为农业生产服务的。如旅大合作社的农具工厂所制的新式农具，山西铁业生产社所产的各种锤、锹、镰刀等，唐山专区合作社直属铁工厂所产的喷雾器等，都是农业生产所必需的。部分产品如天津棉织轮带合作社所产的各种轮带和中南区土产松香等，则是与工业生产有密切关系的。
    另外，供应人民消费的也占很大比重。上海市铁床车具生产合作社所产的各种铁床、自由车，上海市第一衬衫缝纫社的合作牌衬衫，第二服装生产社的雨衣、童装，苏北南通合作社监制的各种土布，博山合作窑的陶磁器，西北平凉等生产社所生产的皮袄、毛毯，北京市电业器材生产社出产的各种无线电收音机等，都是精致而适用的生活必需品。
    这个展览会的览展期预定为十五天。会间除互相观摩、交流生产经验以外，并准备通过展览会组织交换。若干产品，在展览会的前一日已有人索取样品，或开始订货。上海市铁床车具生产合作社的医院用床，已为东北某单位订购了一千二百架。
