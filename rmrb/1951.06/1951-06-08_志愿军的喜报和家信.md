　　Volunteer Army's Victory Reports and Letters Home
    More than four thousand victory reports, family letters, and some letters to the people of the motherland from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have recently been brought back to the motherland by representatives of the Third Sub-Group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. These glorious victory reports and family letters will be delivered to various locations.
    Many victory reports were issued by the political organs of units of the Volunteer Army to the families of Volunteer Army soldiers, reporting to them the merits of their sons in the glorious blocking battles on the Han River front and the counter-attack battles on the central Korean front.
    The family letters written by the Volunteer Army soldiers are filled with enthusiasm for defending the country and protecting their homes. A soldier named Lü Zhongli, who received a first-class merit, wrote in a letter to his parents: "I have never forgotten your instructions. You told me to 'Make contributions for the people and win glory for the motherland!' This inspired me to kill many enemies with a hundred times more courage during the forty-day blocking battle on the Han River front; therefore, all glory should belong to you!" Another first-class meritorious soldier named Wang Zhilong wrote in a letter to his mother in Guanxian, Sichuan: "We recently beat the American and Rhee bandit troops to a bloody pulp again in the counter-attack battle in the central region of Korea. We are confident that we can wipe out the enemy cleanly again and again like this! I hope my three older brothers will work hard in their hometowns to actively support us and jointly defend our beloved motherland!"
    Among the letters, there are also many written to the people of the motherland in the name of the collective. The letter from all the combat heroes and combat models of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army stated: "With your support and encouragement, we have defeated the invading army headed by American imperialism more than once. In the victorious battles, we created two first-class merit companies, two second-class merit companies, three third-class merit companies, thirty-nine meritorious platoons and meritorious squads, and nearly two thousand people's meritorious workers and combat heroes and combat models. Some of our comrades—the most outstanding sons of the motherland—shed their last drop of blood in the battles for the motherland, for Korea, and for the people of the world. Their achievements are immortal. We, the living comrades, are inheriting their glorious cause and are fighting to the end with redoubled efforts!"
    "We have defeated the enemy, but we are not satisfied," the heroes continued to write, "The enemy's effective strength has not yet been completely annihilated, and the enemy's firepower and equipment still occupy a considerable advantage. In order to escape the fate of being finally annihilated, the enemy has become more desperately struggling and cunning and shameless. We still have to fight for a considerable period of time and arduous battles. We are universally launching a learn-while-fighting, study-while-fighting, and improve-while-fighting movement in front of the enemy, striving to learn the skills of annihilating the enemy and striving to finally defeat this powerful imperialist enemy."
    The people's meritorious workers of a certain regiment of the Volunteer Army wrote in a letter to the people of the motherland on May 9th: "In the first stage of the counter-attack battle, the Third Squad of our Fourth Company boldly outflanked the enemy's artillery position from the side and rear, and at the cost of only two casualties, annihilated nearly a platoon of the enemy and occupied the high ground. In the new second stage of combat mission, in order to thank the people of the motherland for their condolences and love, we must annihilate the enemy's effective strength in even greater quantities, eliminate the enemy's organized units, destroy the enemy's tanks in large numbers, strive for new glory, and create more heroic units and individuals of collective heroism."

　　志愿军的喜报和家信
    中国人民志愿军的四千余件喜报、家书与一部分给祖国人民的信件，新近由中国人民赴朝慰问团第三分团代表带回祖国。这些光荣的喜报与家书，将分别投送到各地。
    许多喜报是志愿军某部政治机关发给志愿军军人家属，向他们报告他们的子弟在光辉的汉江前线阻击战与朝鲜中部前线反击战中立下的功勋。
    志愿军战士们写的家信中，洋溢着保家卫国的热情。一位立了一等功的战士吕仲礼，写一封给他父母亲的信上写道：“我一刻也没有忘记你们的叮嘱，你们要我‘为人民立功，为祖国争光！’这激励了我在四十天的汉江前线阻击战中勇气百倍地杀死很多敌人；因此，一切光荣应该是属于你们的！”另一位名叫王治龙的一等功臣写给他远在四川灌县的母亲的信内说：“我们最近在朝鲜中部地区反击战中，又把美李匪军打得头破血流，我们有把握照这样一次又一次地把敌人消灭干净！我希望三位哥哥在家乡努力生产，积极支援我们，一齐保卫我们可爱的祖国！”
    信件中，还有不少是用集体名义写给祖国人民的信。志愿军某部全体战斗英雄、战斗模范的信说：“在你们的支援与鼓舞下，我们已经不止一次地打败了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军。我们在胜利的战斗中创造了两个一等功连，两个二等功连，三个三等功连，三十九个功臣排与功臣班，近二千名人民功臣与战斗英雄、战斗模范。我们有些同志——祖国人民最优秀的儿子，在战斗中为祖国、为朝鲜、为世界人民流尽了他最后一滴血，他们的功绩是永垂不朽的。我们活着的同志，正继承他们的荣誉的事业，用加倍的努力坚持战斗到底！”
    “我们战胜了敌人，但我们没有满足。”英雄们继续写道：“敌人的有生力量还没有最后被歼灭，敌人的火力、装备还占相当优势，为了逃避最后被歼的命运，敌人变得更加拚命挣扎与狡猾无耻了。我们还要作相当长期的与艰苦的战斗。我们正在普遍展开边打、边研究、边提高的敌前学习运动，努力学会歼敌本领，争取最后战胜这个帝国主义强敌。”
    志愿军某团人民功臣们在五月九日写给祖国人民的信内道：“我们四连三班在反击战的第一阶段中，大胆迂回敌火力阵地侧后，仅以伤亡两人的代价，歼敌近一个排，攻占了高地。在新的第二阶段作战任务中，为了答谢祖国人民的慰问与热爱，我们一定要更加大量地歼灭敌人有生力量，消灭敌人建制部队，大量地打毁敌人的坦克，争取新的光荣，创造更多的集体英雄主义的英雄单位与人物。”
