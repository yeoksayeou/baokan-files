　　Renqianhu Village Borrows Electric Water Pump, Over 300 Mu of Wasteland Transformed into Paddy Fields
To the Editor:
    Not long ago, the government allocated 320 mu of wasteland to the farmers in our village; later, they lent us an electric water pump. We used this electric water pump to draw water, and now we have turned this wasteland into paddy fields. When we first discussed reclaiming this wasteland, farmer Ren Dengxian suggested that there was a water source near the wasteland, and we could find a way to turn this wasteland into paddy fields, which could greatly increase the harvest and strengthen the power to resist America and aid Korea. Everyone was very enthusiastic about this matter. The district cadres also actively supported and encouraged us. We borrowed an eight-horsepower electric water pump from the Ninghe County People's Government. After everyone's intense reclamation and renovation, all 320 mu of wasteland have been turned into paddy fields. Looking at this newly opened paddy field, everyone is very happy. The masses are determined to cultivate well, and to plow once, harrow five times, and hoe three times. Many people said, "This paddy field was completely created with the help of the state. When we harvest the grain, we must select the best to hand over as public grain."

　　任千户村贷到电滚子三百多亩荒地变成水田编辑同志：
    不久前，政府曾分配给我村农民三百二十亩荒地；后来又贷给我们一个电滚子。我们用这架电滚子抽水，现在已经把这块荒地变成水田。在最初讨论开垦这块荒地时，农民任登先提出，荒地附近有水源，咱们可以想法把这些荒地变成水田，这就可以大大增加收获，加强抗美援朝的力量。大家对这件事非常热心。区干部也积极赞助和鼓励我们。我们就从宁河县人民政府贷到八匹马力的电滚子一个。经过大家紧张的开垦和整修，现在三百二十亩荒地已全部变成了水田。望着这块新开的水田，人人心里都非常高兴。群众决心好好耕种，要做到耕一遍，耙五遍，锄三遍。很多人都说：“这块水田可完全是在国家的帮助下搞成的，咱们打了粮食，要选出最好的缴公粮。”
