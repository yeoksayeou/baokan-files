　　According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Pyongyang: North Korean public opinion is enthusiastically supporting the Soviet government's proposal on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan. The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 29th, stating: The Soviet government's proposal powerfully exposes the US imperialists' conspiracy to transform Japan into their aggressive base and colony in the Far East. The Soviet government's proposal not only completely conforms to the vital interests of the Korean people but also to the vital interests of peace-loving people around the world, and to the vital interests of the Japanese people. We, the Korean people, are determined to realize the Soviet government's proposal, which fully conforms to our national interests, through even stronger struggle.
　　The "Labor News" editorial pointed out: The US imperialists' use of Japan to invade Korea has aroused unparalleled anger among the people of the world and is even more intolerable to the Korean people. The Korean people resolutely oppose the US imperialists' conspiracy to rearm Japan and turn Japan into their aggressive base, and fully support the Soviet proposal to make Japan a democratic, free, and independent country.
　　At the same time, democratic propaganda rooms and newspaper reading groups throughout the rear areas of North Korea are enthusiastically discussing the Soviet government's opinion and Foreign Minister Zhou's statement supporting the Soviet government's opinion. Workers, farmers, staff members, women, and youth participating in the discussions unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for the Soviet proposal and opposition to the US aggressors turning Japan into a base for aggression against Korea, China, and Asia.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Vietnam News Agency reported: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on May 30th regarding the US's intention to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and the US, British, and French military conference in Singapore. The full text of the statement is as follows: "The intention of the United States to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan and the purpose of the US, British, and French military conference in Singapore are to prepare for a third world war. In the eyes of the people of Vietnam, Korea, China, and South Asia, and in the eyes of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world, this is a crazy provocative act by the imperialist camp headed by the United States. The Vietnamese people resisted Japanese fascists for five years (1940-1945) and have been resisting French imperialists and American interventionists since 1945. They are more aware than anyone else of the imperialists' conspiracy to rearm Japanese fascists, maintain their position in Vietnam, and oppose the independence movement in Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese people strongly protest these conspiracies and will exert even greater strength to carry out the war of resistance in order to eliminate the aggressors and contribute to the defense of world peace."

　　朝鲜越南反对美国单独对日媾和
    痛斥美国重新武装日本侵略亚洲的阴谋
    朝鲜舆论拥护苏联政府对日和约建议
    【本报讯】据新华社平壤讯：朝鲜舆论热烈拥护苏联政府关于对日和约问题的建议。《民主朝鲜》报二十九日发表社论说：苏联政府的提案强有力地揭露了美帝国主义变日本为其远东的侵略基地与殖民地的阴谋。苏联政府的提案不仅和朝鲜人民而且和全世界爱好和平人民的切身利益，与日本人民的切身利益，也是完全符合的。我们朝鲜人民决以更坚强的斗争来实现完全符合我们民族利益的苏联政府的提案。
    《劳动新闻》的社论指出：美帝国主义利用日本侵略朝鲜的罪行已激起全世界人民的无比愤怒，更为朝鲜人民所不能容忍。朝鲜人民坚决反对美帝国主义重新武装日本、变日本为其侵略基地的阴谋，完全支持使日本成为民主、自由、独立国家的苏联提案。
    同时，朝鲜后方各地的民主宣传室与读报会热烈讨论苏联政府的意见书和我周外长支持苏联政府意见的声明。参加讨论会的工人、农民、职员、妇女、青年一致表示热烈地拥护苏联的建议，反对美国侵略者把日本变为侵略朝鲜、中国和亚洲的基地。
    【新华社二日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国外交部发言人于五月三十日就美国想与日本单独媾和及美、英、法新加坡军事会议发表一项声明。声明全文如下：“美国与日本单独媾和的意图和美、英、法三国新加坡军事会议的目的，在于准备第三次世界大战。在越南、朝鲜与中国及南亚的人民看来，在以苏联为首的民主阵营和世界上一切爱好和平的人民看来，这是以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的疯狂的挑衅行为。越南人民曾经抗拒日本法西斯达五年之久（一九四○年——一九四五年），并且自一九四五年以来即在抵抗着法国帝国主义者和美国干涉者。他们比任何人都更洞悉帝国主义者重新武装日本法西斯、保持他们在越南的地位和反对东南亚的独立运动的阴谋。越南人民强烈抗议这些阴谋，并将拿出更大的力量来进行抗战，以便消灭侵略者并对保卫世界和平有所贡献。”
