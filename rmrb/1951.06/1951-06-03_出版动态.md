　　*Collections of Frontline Correspondence from Korea Published*

　　Frontline correspondence from Korea is extremely popular with readers from all regions and social strata. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression is systematically editing it, and the People's Publishing House is publishing it in installments. Seven collections have already been published, with the following titles: First Collection, *Fight for the Motherland, Fight for the Korean People!* (Price Grade A, 3100 yuan); Second Collection, *Breaking Ice and Crossing the Qingchuan River* (Price Grade A, 2700 yuan); Third Collection, *Fighting on the Shores of Changjin Lake* (Price Grade A, 2600 yuan); Fourth Collection, *Break Through the 38th Parallel, Advance and Advance Again!* (Price Grade A, 3500 yuan); Fifth Collection, *The Days and Nights on the South Bank of the Han River* (Price Grade A, 2900 yuan); Sixth Collection, *How Did We Defeat the Enemy?* (Price Grade A, 2400 yuan); Seventh Collection, *Behind the Front Lines in Korea* (Price Grade A, 2000 yuan). These collections of correspondence take the major battles on the Korean battlefield as the warp, and the heroic and soul-stirring combat deeds of our brave People's Volunteer Army as the weft, combined with relevant materials and photographs, compiled into separate collections. They serve as the most realistic and vivid teaching materials for conducting patriotism and internationalism education.

　　*Two Incidents Regarding the Suppression of Criticism*

　　Gong Liansheng, the head of Baolin Township in Yanling District, Danyang County, Southern Jiangsu, and village cadre Pan Yatou, etc., carried out a series of retaliatory attacks against a correspondent who submitted a letter to the newspaper criticizing the work of the township. The Yanling District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yanling District People's Government adopted a bureaucratic attitude of ignoring this matter, which further fueled the development of this erroneous behavior. Later, after *Southern Jiangsu Daily* sent reporters to investigate twice, and decided to publicly publish the matter, the District Committee began to pay attention and made a review. On May 15th, *Southern Jiangsu Daily* published the course of events and the District Committee's preliminary review. In addition to publishing the error review of this incident, the newspaper also published an editorial entitled "Struggle to Resolutely Launch Criticism and Self-Criticism."

　　*Hunan Mass Daily* published on May 19th the news of Liu Pengjiu and others, land reform cadres of Yandun Township in the Fifteenth District of Changsha County, detaining and beating the newspaper's correspondent Ni Fuda, and the newspaper's investigation results. Regarding this matter, the newspaper had written to the Changsha County Committee on April 8th requesting appropriate handling, but as of May 25th, no reply had been seen in the newspaper.

　　*Publication of the Third Issue of Volume Four of "New Construction"*

　　The third issue of Volume Four of *New Construction* has been published. The special articles published in this issue, in terms of promoting patriotism, include Rong Mengyuan's "Patriotism and Historical Science" and Chang Renxia's "Promoting Patriotism by Understanding Classical Art." In terms of research on financial and economic theory, there are Xu Dixing's "The Lending Relationship and Interest of the People's Economy" and Zhou Bodi's "From Cash Management to Currency Management." In terms of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, there is Gao Fang's "From the Paris Commune to the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries." In terms of studying *On Practice*, there are Shen Zhiyuan's "The Significance and Basic Viewpoints of *On Practice*" and the complete continuation of Li Da's "*On Practice* Explanation." To celebrate the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the journal published two papers on ethnic minorities: Li Qi's "A Methodological Critique of Lenin's Theory of Nationalities on Luxemburg" and Fei Xiaotong's "Developing Literary and Artistic Work to Serve Ethnic Minorities." The symposium records column continues to publish the records of the New Legal Studies Association's symposium "*On Practice* and New Legal Studies." The book review column publishes Tian Rong's translation and Okulov's review of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Institute of Philosophy's collective writing, *Historical Materialism*.
