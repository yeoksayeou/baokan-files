　　Public Security Groups in Rural Hunan
    The public security groups established in the vast rural areas of Hunan Province have been of great help in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Rural public security officers in various localities have demonstrated remarkable work achievements in reporting situations, exposing counter-revolutionary elements, and controlling unlawful landlords. Rural public security officers in Linxiang County uncovered three special agent cases during the land reform movement, seizing two secret radio stations. Public security officers and public security groups in Xiangyin, Yueyang, and other counties assisted public security organs in solving several cases. Many county public security officers also displayed courageous and resourceful actions in assisting troops in suppressing bandits. Public security officers in Zhijiang County assisted bandit suppression troops in persuading 13 bandit leaders and 199 bandits to surrender within 20 days, and captured 59 bandits. Zhang Jizhong, a public security officer in Huang County, secretly tracked the major bandit Yao Zhenggang for over a hundred *li* to assist the government in capturing Yao alive. In the areas along the Yuehan Railway in Yueyang and Xiangyin Counties, and along the Zhegan Railway in Liling County, public security organs, with local public security officers as the core, contacted activists to organize public security groups or defense committees to protect the safety of railway transportation. Yuanling, Huitong, Yongshun, and other special districts even convened public security representative conferences at the county level, mainly composed of rural public security officers and militiamen. Through the more than 6,000 representatives attending the conferences, a movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was launched in the vast rural areas. According to statistics from Yuanling, Jing County, Chenxi, and other eight counties, since these conferences were held successively in February and March, within a month, the representatives in each county mobilized the masses to kill or capture 73 bandits and special agent ringleaders, and forced a number of counter-revolutionary elements to register and surrender to the People's Government.
    The organization of rural public security officers in Hunan was mostly established during the rent reduction, anti-local tyrant, and land reform movements last winter and this spring. The public security officers in various counties are mostly activists who emerged during various social reform movements. Some were individually developed after education and training in actual struggles; others were active elements discovered among the masses and absorbed during the propaganda and education of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, the composition of public security officers in various localities is relatively pure, becoming an important bridge for public security organs to closely connect with the peasant masses. For example, many public security officers in Yiyang, Xiangtan, and other counties not only frequently report to the People's Government on matters related to public security, but also report on the rural production situation and directly lead production, etc.

### 湖南农村中的治安小组

　　湖南农村中的治安小组
    湖南省广大农村中建立的治安小组，对镇压反革命工作帮助很大。各地农村治安员在反映情况、检举反革命分子及管制不法地主等方面，都表现了显著的工作成绩。临湘县的农村治安员，在土地改革运动中破获了特务案件三起，缴获秘密电台两部。湘阴、岳阳等县的治安员和治安小组，协助公安机关破案数起。许多县的治安员并在协助部队清剿土匪中，表现了英勇机智的行动。芷江县的治安员曾协助剿匪部队，在二十天内争取匪首十三名、匪众一百九十九名来降，并捕获土匪五十九名。晃县治安员张积忠，为捕捉该县巨匪姚正刚，曾暗中跟踪姚匪百余里，协助政府将姚匪活捉。在岳阳、湘阴等县沿粤汉路地区及醴陵县沿浙赣路地区，公安机关曾以当地治安员为核心，联系积极分子组织治安小组或保卫委员会，护卫铁路交通的安全。沅陵、会同、永顺等专区并曾以农村治安员及民兵为主，分县召开治安代表会议，通过与会的六千多代表，在广大农村开展了镇压反革命运动。据沅陵、靖县、辰溪等八县统计，自二、三月间先后召开了这种会议以后，不到一个月，各县代表即发动群众毙、俘土匪及特务头子七十三名，并迫使一批反革命分子向人民政府登记自首。
    湖南农村治安员的组织，大部分地区是在去冬今春的减租、反恶霸及土地改革运动中建立起来的。各县治安员大部是在各项社会改革运动中出现的积极分子。他们有些是在实际斗争中经过教育培养后个别发展的；还有些是在进行镇压反革命宣传教育时，在群众中发现的积极分子而被吸收的，因而各地治安员成份较纯洁，成为公安机关密切联系农民群众的重要桥梁。如益阳、湘潭等县的许多治安员，不仅经常向人民政府反映有关治安的情况，并同时反映了农村的生产情况和直接领导生产等。
