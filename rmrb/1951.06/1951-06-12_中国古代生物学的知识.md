　　Ancient Chinese Biological Knowledge
　　Feng Yuming, Li Zhichao
    Our ancestors, in the land of our great motherland, labored and fought with nature for thousands of years. We have a rich historical heritage. In terms of biological knowledge, even from the documents available for verification, there are many brilliant creations.

    From the "Three Hundred Poems," this pastoral song of the early feudal society, we can know that in very early times, our ancestors had rich knowledge of using plants for health services. Plants such as "Yuanzhi," "Tu Si Zi," "Yi Mu Cao," "Gualou," and "Shaoyao" were collected as medicinal plants at that time (see Isaka Kin’ko, History of Chinese National Life). In modern terms, some of these plants are antitussives; some are tonics; some can relieve pain; and some can promote lactation. They are all very important crude drugs. "Yao" in "Siyue Xiu Yao" in "Bin Feng Qiyue Pian" is "Yuanzhi." The root of Yuanzhi contains a glycoside, which is an emetic expectorant and can be used to treat catarrhal pneumonia in small animals. "Tui" in "Wufeng Zhonggu You Tui Pian" is "Yi Mu Cao." Yi Mu Cao contains crystalline plant alkali and a large amount of inorganic salts, which can stimulate the central nervous system and have diuretic and hemolytic effects. "Tang" in "Yong Feng Sangzhong Pian" is "Tu Si Zi." "Tu Si Zi" is a parasitic vine of the Convolvulaceae family. The seeds contain resin-like glycosides, which have a tonic effect.

    In the Qin and Han dynasties, we already had clinical medicine that separated "witchcraft" and "medicine." Zhang Ji's "Treatise on Febrile Diseases" is a famous work. From this, it can be seen that the thinking of doctors at that time could reflect the patient's condition more accurately, thus understanding the preliminary material transformation relationship between people (animals) and drugs (mainly plants). Many of the knowledge at that time is still amazing from the perspective of modern medicine.

    For example, modern medicine believes that the best treatment is "causal therapy," and opposes the simple "symptomatic therapy" of treating a headache by treating the head and treating a foot by treating the foot. The key to treating diseases in "Treatise on Febrile Diseases" is to explain, under the principle of "treating the disease based on the symptoms," that the same "cold" should and should not be sweated; the same "sweating" can and cannot use sudorifics; the same "diarrhea" can and cannot use purgatives.

    We know that fever caused by simple physical and chemical reasons is different from that caused by microorganisms. Therefore, using "salicylic acid" drugs that paralyze the thermoregulatory center for fever caused by microbial parasites will not only fail to relieve the fever by sweating, but will also provide good conditions for the microorganisms to continue to proliferate due to the paralysis of the thermoregulatory center. Therefore, it is completely scientific not to administer antipyretics for diseases that do not relieve fever after sweating.

    There are many reasons for constipation, such as improper food properties, lack of exercise, paralysis of intestinal fascia, etc. Eliminating the cause of constipation is the only basic treatment for constipation. Therefore, you cannot prescribe purgatives when you see the symptom of "constipation." (Of course, treating diarrhea is also a method). When we suffer from "dysentery," isn't the initial treatment to use "castor oil" and "magnesium sulfate" first?

    The techniques of pharmaceutical manufacturing and medication are also very clever. In very early times, our ancestors already understood that the same drug produces different effects due to different "quantities." For example, change the ratio of water and sodium sulfate according to different diuretic, stomachic, and diarrheal effects; when using ephedra, remove its "nodes." When boiling two medicinal plants together, put "cinnamon twig," which is not suitable for prolonged boiling, after the boiled ephedra; and also understand that when using a large amount of "aconite," add honey or decoct it to prevent poisoning. From the perspective of modern medicinal botany, who can deny that these knowledge of using drugs has a certain scientific basis?

    Agronomy is a part of applied biology, and is the science of cultivating plants and raising animals. The Chinese people began to plant wheat, millet, rice, and corn as early as the Yin Dynasty. And in terms of cultivation methods, there was already very scientific experience. From the "oracle bone inscriptions" (Lin Qinfu), it can be seen that at this time, our ancestors loosened the soil before sowing, or after transplanting rice seedlings, and loosened it into ridges with a certain interval, instead of growing sparsely in clumps. The knowledge of tree planting in gardens was very advanced. The way the words "you" and "pu" are written in oracle bone inscriptions illustrates this point: the word "you" symbolizes that each area is planted with plants, or seeds are planted, or seedlings are transplanted, or trees are planted; the word "pu" symbolizes the appearance of plants blooming in the garden. By the Western Zhou Dynasty, they also understood the production methods of eliminating weeds, deep plowing, and wide ridges. This can be clearly seen from the sentences in the Book of Songs, "Xiaoya," "Zai Shan," and "Datian."

    In order to ensure the harvest of agricultural production, the Chinese people learned to use scientific methods to fight against "pests" 4,000 years ago. "Using fire to drive away insects and protecting natural enemies" was our creation. From the "Book of Songs" and "Datian Pian," we know that there were many "rice stem borers" and "locusts" at this time. At that time, our ancestors not only prayed to "Shennong," the "ancestor of the fields," but also could dig pits and burn fire to kill insects. Isn't this method of driving away insects, "the ancestor of the fields has a god, and the fire is given," still used by us now to isolate trenches and burn the rice crops with insect eggs? As the name of "Cao Zhong" in "Zhao Nan Pian," because it is a beneficial insect that preys on pests, it had already been protected by farmers at that time.

    In order to ensure the timely progress of agricultural affairs, our ancestors not only paid great attention to astronomy and calendar, but also had a fairly scientific lunar calendar very early. Everyone carried out "spring plowing," "summer weeding," "autumn harvest," and "winter storage" according to the seasons. "Siyue Xiu Yao" and "Bayue Qi Huo" are for planting and cutting; "Jiuyue Zhu Pu Chang" and "Shiyue Na He Jia" are for threshing and entering the warehouse; in August, in order to offer clothes to the lords, they "zai ji, zai yun, zai huang, zai zhu kong yang" to spin hemp and dye; in October, in order to celebrate the Spring Festival, they "huo dao, wei ci chun jiu" to cut rice and brew wine; in November "yu he qu bi huli," in October "qiong zhi xun shu, se xiang jun hu" to hunt, prevent rats, and even "ji sheng," "repair houses," "repair roofs," "repair farm tools"... This is also the earliest and richest record in human lunar calendar knowledge.

    Modern animal husbandry advocates cultivating more feed crops and operating "multi-angle agriculture." Therefore, some people say that our country's agriculture is "grain-based agriculture" and is not good at using green manure. In fact, the Chinese people already had the knowledge of composting manure, fertilizing fields, and making crops flourish. The method of removing weeds such as "cha liao xiu zhi, shu ji mao zhi" and using weeds to fertilize fields is of course still immature, and it is not as good as Vilyams' theory of pasture rotation sowing, but who can deny that this is the earliest discovery of mankind in the history of agricultural production to restore soil fertility 4,000 years ago?

    The ancient man was a hunter, but he also gathered the fruits of plants. Only at a later period, he moved from gathering plants to cultivating plants near his residence. Thus, in ancient times, cultivation occurred - and the cultivation of plants began. Therefore, wild plants became cultivated plants. It must be known: the Chinese people were early plant cultivators. From a very early time, the Chinese people collected birds and beasts and domesticated them into livestock; and looked for mountain and wild grasses and cultivated them into grains. Not only is the invention of sericulture one of the world's greatest inventions; not only is the variety of vegetables the crown of the world; but the cultivation of fruit trees and industrial plants has also made remarkable achievements. Such as fruit tree plants such as Prunus japonica (yu), wild grapes (ao), jujube (zao), and vegetable plants such as radish (lu), cucumber (gua), gourd (hu), leek (jiu), water celery (kui), and bottle gourd (hu); "zhong chao cai lu"; "qiu zhong you ma", large-scale cultivation of dyes and hemp mulberry. These are the fruits of victory achieved by our ancestors through continuous labor and continuous creation (especially being able to use "gourd" as a tool for crossing rivers). Due to the labor and creation of the Chinese people, the morphology of the plants themselves has also changed. This situation led to the emergence of new plants and became the beginning of today's variety improvement work.

    Our ancestors had richer production experience in fighting against disasters. In the early Han Dynasty, there were agricultural experts such as Fan Shengzhi and Zhao Guo. The fields were divided into several small pieces, and small ditches one foot deep were dug in the middle, and rotten crops were piled up. This is the "area field method" to prevent ground moisture from evaporating. Small ditches were dug in the ground, and crops were cultivated between the ditches. The ditch of the first year was planted in the second year; the field of the first year was dug into a ditch in the second year. This method of rotating and recuperating the land increased the yield per mu by one stone. This "rotation field method" was the creation of this time.

    From the perspective of the unity of organisms and living conditions, each organism requires different external conditions. In terms of knowledge of preventing disasters, the Chinese people were able to appreciate this truth early on. The Book of Han on Food and Goods stated that when cultivating grains, five kinds can be mixed, namely: millet, glutinous millet, hemp, wheat, and beans. Even if one or two kinds are harmed, the others can be spared from disasters. This method is still one of the good ways for us to overcome unfavorable natural conditions in agricultural production even today. From the living characteristics of plants, our ancestors had a preliminary knowledge of "crop rotation." In the Western Zhou Dynasty, there was a "three-field system" of rotating fallow, which accumulated a lot of scientific experience for human agricultural production and enriched people's lives. In particular, it is outstanding to cultivate two-thirds of the land every year, and the other is used as a multi-angle agricultural operation for pastures. The sentence "bo yan cai qi, yu bi xin tian, yu ci zi yu" (xin tian means land that is not easy to change, land that is easy to change once is called yu, and land that is easy to change twice is called zi.) (see Wu Ze, "Ancient History") is a good example.

    To gradually increase the harvest, it is necessary to create fertile soil. In the Western Han Dynasty, people understood that soil was divided into "nine kinds" according to the different minerals it contained; at the same time, animal bones and animal manure were used as fertilizers - this was the beginning of the use of organic fertilizers.

    In terms of animal husbandry and forestry, our ancestors understood the knowledge of protecting forests, managing forests, and specializing in raising livestock very early. Protecting tall trees with "bi shi gan tang, wu jian wu fa"; the method of felling trees with "fa mu ji qi dian, xi xin sui qi li". "Si Jian" was responsible for forest management, "shepherd" was in charge of training the six animals for sacrifices, "Ma Zhi" and "Xiao Ren" were in charge of training military horses; "Ming Shi" and "Xue Shi" hunted wild animals; "Shu Yu" rode; and "Jiang Chu" cut grass and fed food. Judging from today's horse administration organization, this is probably the earliest scientific division of labor in human livestock breeding. As early as the Yin Dynasty, we can see from the "oracle bone inscriptions" that there were already six animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, horses, and chickens.

    Our motherland has a rich historical heritage and scientific creation. Only a few textual researches on biology have proved this point. The saying that without foreign "enlightenment," China would have no science is a statement by imperialists to insult the Chinese people.

    Comrades working in biological science! We should proudly inherit the glorious heritage of our ancestors, and on the theoretical basis of Michurin's biological science, appropriately absorb the knowledge in my country's biology that conforms to scientific theory, absorb the production experience and creation of my country's working people for thousands of years, and use the theory of Michurin's learning to analyze it.

　　中国古代生物学的知识
　　冯玉明　李志超
    我们的祖先，在自己伟大祖国的土地上，勤劳地和自然作了数千年的生产斗争。我们是有着丰富的历史遗产的。在生物知识方面，仅就有文献可资考证的，也有许多光辉的创造。
    从《诗三百篇》这一初期封建社会的牧歌里，可以知道：在很早的时候，我们的祖先，就有了使用植物为健康服务的丰富知识。“远志”、“菟丝子”、“益母草”、“括楼”、“芍药”等植物，在当时已当作药用植物被采集了（见井坂锦江中国民族生活史）。这些植物，在现代看来，有的是镇咳剂；有的是强壮剂；有的可以止痛；有的可以催乳。都是很重要的生药。《豳风七月篇》的“四月秀葽”的“葽”是“远志”，远志的根含有一种配糖质，是呕心性怯痰剂，能用于小动物加答儿性肺炎的治疗。《五风中谷有蓷篇》的“蓷”是“益母草”，益母草含有结晶性的植物碱及多量的无机盐类，能兴奋中枢神经，有利尿、溶血的作用。《鄘风桑中篇》的“爰采唐矣”的“唐”是“菟丝子”，“菟丝子”是旋花科的寄生蔓草，种子里含有树脂样配糖体，是有强身作用的。
    在秦、汉时代，我们已经有了分离“巫”与“医”的临床医学。张机的“伤寒论”是一部有名的著作。从这里可以看出：当时医生的思想，已能比较正确地反映了病人的情况，从而在人（动物）与药品（主要是植物）之间，理解了初步的物质转化关系，许多当时的知识，就是从现代的医学看来，也是值得惊叹的。
    比如：近代医学认为最好的治疗是“原因疗法”，反对头痛医头，脚痛医脚的单纯“对症疗法”。“伤寒论”的治病要领就在“从症治之”的原则下，说明了同样“感冒”有应该发汗的与不发汗的；同样“发汗”，有可用发汗剂与不可用发汗剂的；同样“泻肚”有可用下剂与不可用下剂的。
    我们知道：由于单纯理化学原因所引起的发热，与微生物所引起的是不同的。因之，把麻痹温中枢的“水杨酸”属药品用于有微生物寄生的发热，不仅不能因发汗而解热，反因麻痹温中枢而给微生物以良好的条件，使其继续增殖。所以，对发汗后不解热的疾候，不再投以解热剂，是完全科学的。
    便秘的原因很多，如食物性质的不相当，运动不足，肠管筋膜麻痹……等而消除引起便秘的原因，才是便秘唯一的基本疗法。因之，就不能见了“便秘”的症候便投下剂。（当然，泻肚的治疗也是一个办法）。我们在患“赤痢”的时候，在初期的治疗，不是先用“蓖麻油”和“硫苦”吗？
    制药用药的技术，也是很巧妙的。在很早的时候，我们的祖先已经懂得了同一种药品因“量”的不同而产生不同的效果。比如：随着利尿、健胃、泻肚的不同，改变水量与芒硝量的比例；使用麻黄时，要摘取它的“节”。两种药用植物，煮在一起的时候，要把不适宜于长时间煮沸的“桂枝”，放在煮好的麻黄之后；并且还懂得：用多量的“附子”的时候，要加上蜂蜜，或者加以浓煎，以防止中毒。这些使用药品的知识，就是从现代的药用植物学看来，谁能否认它有一定的科学基础呢？
    农学是应用生物学的一部分，是栽培植物，饲养动物的科学。中国人民远在殷的时代即已开始种麦、黍、稻、粟。而且在栽培的方法上，已经有了非常科学的经验。从“龟甲兽骨文字”（林秦辅氏）中可以看出：这时，我们的祖先，在未播种之前，或插秧之后，把土翻松，疏成一畦，作一定的间隔，而不是星散丛生。园圃的树艺知识是十分进步的。甲骨文中“囿”、“圃”这两个字的写法就说明了这一点：“囿”字象征各区种植着植物，或挖下种子，或插苗芽，或植树木；“圃”字象征园中植物盛开花朵的样子。到了西周时代，又懂得了消灭杂草，深耕、宽垅的生产方法。这可以从诗经《小雅》《载芟》《大田》等篇的句子里清楚看到的。
    为了保证农业生产的收获，四千年前的中国人民就学会了用科学的方法来和“害虫”作斗争。“用火驱虫，保护天敌”便是我们的创造。从《诗经》《大田篇》我们知道：这时“螟蛾”与“蝗”是很多的。当时，我们的祖先不仅只向“田祖”的“神农”进行祈愿，而且能掘坑焚火杀虫了。这种“田祖有神，秉畀炎火”的驱虫方法，我们在现在不也还是掘沟隔离，用火焚烧带有虫卵的禾稼吗？作为《召南篇》名的“草螽”，因为它是捕食害虫的益虫，当时早已被农家加以保护了。
    我们的祖先为了保证农事的如期进行，不只对天文历法非常注意，而且在很早的时候就已经有了相当科学的农历，大家按着季节进行“春耕”、“夏耘”、“秋收”、“冬藏”。“四月秀葽”，“八月其获”是种地、割地；“九月筑圃场”，“十月纳禾稼”是打场、入仓；八月里为了向领主献纳衣料，则“载绩、载云、载黄、栽朱孔阳”去绩麻染色；十月里为了庆祝春节则“获稻、为此春酒”去刈稻酿酒；十一月“于貉取彼狐狸”，十月“穹窒熏鼠，塞向墐户”去打猎、防鼠、以至于“绩绳”，“修房子”，“修房盖”，“修理农具”……这在人类农历知识上，也是最早、最丰富的纪录。
    近代的畜产学，主张多栽培饲料作物，经营“多角农业”。因此，有人说：我国的农业是“主谷式农业”，不善于用绿肥。其实，中国人民早就有了沤粪、肥田，使庄稼茂盛的知识了。“茶蓼朽止、黍稷茂止”的除掉杂草以及用杂草肥田的办法，固然它还是幼稚，还比不上牧草循环播种的维里亚木斯学说，但谁又能否认这是四千年前人类在农业生产史上的最初恢复土壤肥沃性的发现呢？
    远古时代的人是一个猎者，但是他一方面也进行着采集植物的果实。只有在较晚的时期，他由采集植物而转移到在其住所附近栽培植物。这样，在古代就发生了耕作——开始了植物的栽培。因此，野生的植物就变成栽培植物。必须知道：中国人民是早期的植物栽培者。中国人民从很早的时候起，就收集飞禽野兽，驯为家畜；寻找山原野草，培成谷物。不只蚕丝的发明是世界最伟大的发明之一；不仅蔬菜种类之多，为世界之冠；就是果树和工艺植物的栽培，也有显著的成就。如郁李（郁）、野葡萄（薁）、枣（枣）等果树植物，萝卜（庐）、黄瓜（瓜）、葫芦（壶）、韭（韭）、水芹（葵）、瓠瓜（瓠）等蔬菜植物的育成；“终朝采绿”；“丘中有麻”，大规模的栽培着染料和麻桑。这些都是我们的祖先，以不断的劳动和不断的创造所取得的胜利果实（特别是已经能使用“瓠”做过河时的工具）。由于中国人民的劳动创造，植物本身的形态也就变更了。这种情况就引导了新的植物的出现，成为今日品种改良事业的嚆矢。
    和灾害作斗争，我们的祖先，更有丰富的生产经验。汉初出现了农学专门大家泛胜之、赵过。把田地分成若干小块，中间掘成一尺深的小沟，堆上腐败的农作物。这就是防止地面水分蒸发的“区田法”，地里挖出小沟，把谷物栽培于沟间。第一年的沟，第二年种地；第一年的地，第二年挖沟。这样轮流休养地力，使一亩地的产量增加了一石。这一“代田法”便是这时的创造。
    从生物体与生活条件的统一看来，每种生物体都在要求不同的外界条件。在防止灾害的知识上，中国人民早就能体会了这一个道理。汉书食货志上，关于栽培谷物的问题，说明了播种谷物时，可杂种五种，即：黍、稷、麻、麦、豆，其中一二种虽受害，其他可免于灾害。这种办法直到现代也还是我们农业生产上克服不利自然条件的好办法之一。我们的祖先，从植物体的生活特性上，已经初步地有了“轮栽”知识。西周时代，就有了轮流休耕的“三圃制”，给人类农业生产上，积累了许多科学经验，丰富了人民生活。特别是每年耕种土地的三分之二，其他辟为牧场的多角的农业经营，是很出色的。“薄言采芑，于彼新田，于此菑畬”（新田即不易之田，一易之田曰畬，再易之田曰菑。）（见吴泽《古代史》）的句子，便是很好的例证。
    要逐渐提高收获，必须创造肥沃的土壤。西汉时代，人民就懂得依土壤所含之不同矿物质，把土壤分为“九种”；同时，用兽骨、动物的粪尿作肥料——这是使用有机肥料的开端。
    在牧畜、森林方面，我们的祖先很早就懂得了保护森林，管理森林，专门饲养牲畜的知识。“蔽市甘堂，毋剪毋伐”的保护乔木；“伐木掎其巅，析薪随其理”的伐木方法。“司?”则负责森林的管理，“牧人”则职掌驯致祭祀用的六畜，“马质”、“校人”则专司军马的调教；狩猎野兽则有“冥氏”、“穴氏”；骑乘则有“蜀御”；割草、喂食则有“羗刍”。在今天的马政机构组织上看来，这恐怕是人类在饲养家畜上最早的科学分工。远在殷的时代，从“卜辞”里就能看到当时已经具备了牛、羊、豕、犬、马、鸡等六畜了。
    我们的祖国，是有着丰富的历史遗产和科学创造的，仅就生物学上的几点考证，就证明了这一点，没有外国人的“教化”，中国便没有科学，乃是帝国主义者污辱中国人民的说法。
    生物科学的工作同志们！我们应该骄傲地继承我们祖先光辉的遗产，在米邱林生物科学的理论基础上，适当地吸收我国生物学中合乎科学理论的知识，吸收我国劳动人民几千年来的生产经验和创造，并用米邱林学说的理论，加以分析。
