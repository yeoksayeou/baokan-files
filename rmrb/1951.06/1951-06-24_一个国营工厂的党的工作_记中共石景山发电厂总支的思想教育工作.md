　　Party Work in a State-Owned Factory
    ——A Record of the Ideological Education Work of the General Party Branch of the Shijingshan Power Plant
    By Our Correspondent Pei Lan
    The General Party Branch of the Shijingshan Power Plant of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, constantly pays attention to conducting socialist education for all Communist Party members and all workers, gradually improving the class consciousness of Party members and workers, thereby supervising and ensuring the realization of the national production plan.
  After Full Ideological Education Inside and Outside the Party, All Employees Were Mobilized to Reduce Coal Consumption Rate
    One of the biggest problems in the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant is high coal consumption and high costs. In May of last year, the actual coal consumption of the plant was 5.4% higher than the quota set by the Central Fuel Department. The General Party Branch of the plant concentrated its efforts to specifically solve this problem. The General Branch conducted in-depth investigations and research in advance, especially with workers familiar with the problem. From the research and analysis, it was determined that the current coal consumption could be reduced, and the specific numbers for reducing coal consumption were calculated. Therefore, the slogan "Strive to reduce coal consumption to 0.78 kg per kilowatt-hour" was put forward, and the whole plant was called upon to launch a labor competition in June, sign collective contracts, and develop rationalization proposals to realize this slogan.
    At this time, the General Branch held several consecutive meetings to discuss and study the issue of signing collective contracts. During the discussion, the advanced Soviet experience in signing collective contracts was humbly learned. The advanced Soviet experience is that 90% of the people should participate in the signing of the contract. Wang Zimian, the secretary of the General Branch, determined that the contract could be signed after most of the employees understood the significance of signing the contract, according to the level of awareness of the workers in the plant. However, individual cadres believed that the contract could not be signed until more than 90% of the employees fully understood the significance of the collective contract. Although this idea occurred in individual cadres, it is worth noting because it is a question of how to combine advanced experience with specific circumstances. The General Branch convened the General Branch Committee to specifically discuss this issue. Factory Director Liu Yingyuan said, "Signing a contract is better than not signing a contract." This solved the problem. At the meeting, a resolution was passed to mobilize employees to sign collective contracts. The General Branch gave this resolution to all Communist Party members for study and discussion, and then to all employees for discussion. Some workers said that signing a contract would separate the administration and the trade union; some workers said that signing a contract was piecework; and expressed disagreement. Regarding the development of rationalization proposals, some employees also resisted it very strongly ideologically. Some people said, "Proposing rationalization proposals is for simpletons." Some people were afraid that after proposing rationalization proposals, production efficiency would increase, and they might lose their jobs. Individual workers even questioned the workers who proposed rationalization proposals, saying: "You are going to ruin our decades-old jobs." Regarding these ideas that hinder the signing of collective contracts and the improvement of technology, the General Branch conducted in-depth persuasion and education to dispel the various ideological concerns of the workers; firmly supported the opinions of Factory Director Liu Yingyuan; and approved the reward methods for rationalization proposals at the employee representative meeting, opening up the way for technological improvement. The General Branch actively promoted the trade union through Party members, mobilized workers, formulated group plans; and mobilized Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to learn from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang group and took the lead in formulating good group plans. The General Branch directly led the branches, cultivated typical groups, and promoted the work of the whole plant. Communist Party member Liu Dezhen took the lead in leading the group to challenge the inspection group of the whole plant. The Liang Fengchang group challenged the other two shifts of the pulverized coal furnace. The Cai Xuecheng group challenged all the operating workers in the plant. The labor competition between individuals, groups, workshops, and shifts (three shifts rotate every day, each shift is eight hours, and shifts are different from general shifts) was launched, and rationalization proposals began to appear. At this time, the focus of the General Branch shifted to promoting the trade union, deeply inspecting the implementation of the plans of each group, and urging the administration to inspect the quality of work. The General Branch also used the time for Party lectures to commend the advanced, criticize the backward, and mobilize all Party members to ensure the completion of this task. As a result, coal consumption exceeded the target at 0.768, and costs were greatly reduced. The Liu Dezhen group of the repair team of the steam turbine plant exceeded the plan by 85.9% in June; the Liang Fengchang group of the pulverized coal furnace created a new record of not extinguishing the fire once in ten months. The scrap rate of the foundry department of the repair shop was reduced from 40% to 3.58%. The Cai Xuecheng group of the steam turbine operation shift did not have any accidents for eight months. In June, 150 new records appeared throughout the month, and 92 rationalization proposals were put forward. After this labor competition, the plant began to formulate new production standards; the trade union and the administration found a way to face production; and the General Branch further clearly realized from practical experience that it must strengthen ideological education and mobilize the workers from the ideological level to do a good job in production. Through the June contract, the broad masses of employees truly realized their own wisdom and strength and recognized the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Mobilizing the workers' strength to reduce coal consumption is just one example of the Shijingshan Power Plant's attention to ideological education. In fact, the General Branch of the plant has always paid more attention to conducting socialist education for employees. Of course, in the process of conducting socialist education, it is often necessary to conduct fierce ideological struggles inside and outside the Party to ensure the realization of the Party's and the government's policies and guidelines.
  The General Branch Committee Pays Attention to Studying Ideological Situations and Strengthened Employee Unity Through Class Education
    They often go through very fierce ideological struggles. For example, not long after the factory was taken over, the question of how to treat technical personnel arose. At that time, some technical personnel did not understand the policies of the Party and the government, and they were passively coping with their work and were irresponsible. A certain assistant engineer said: "Wandering around before and after work, dealing with affairs for four hours, coping for two hours." And some Party members and workers believed that the situation of these technical personnel was complicated, they were arrogant, and they adopted an attitude of ignoring or even excluding them. Some leading cadres believed that technical personnel were treasures, and they neither urged nor criticized them, adopting a completely "laissez-faire" attitude. The General Branch analyzed the ideological situation of cadres, Party members, workers, and technical personnel, and promptly put forward the slogan of uniting technical personnel. First, education was conducted among the cadres to overcome the thinking of discriminating against technical personnel and unconditionally accommodating technical personnel, and the incorrect attitude of cadres, Party members, and workers towards technical personnel was initially reversed. At the same time, political education was conducted for technical personnel to improve their awareness of serving the people, and technical personnel with higher awareness were absorbed to listen to Party lectures and attend meetings of the General Branch Committee. These technical personnel saw the strict criticism and self-criticism within the Party and generally reflected: "The Communist Party is strict, and this is how it can progress. We must study hard!" The General Branch also planned and cautiously absorbed individual technical personnel who had met the standards for Party membership into the Party, so that all employees truly realized that "employees are part of the working class," thus dispelling ideological concerns, and work enthusiasm gradually increased, feeling that the Party valued them. Li Changxi, a technician, became the director of the steam turbine plant and worked very actively, leading the entire plant to create a new record of no major accidents for three months. Technician Wang Zhenyu went deep into the site, studied the situation of the coal pulverizer, and proposed increasing the fineness of the pulverized coal, which resulted in a reduction in coal consumption. Engineer Yu Yunhai took the initiative to participate in the overhaul of No. 5 unit and personally solved the problem of dynamic balance.
  Corrected the Error of Purely Technical Viewpoints and Cleansed Bad Elements to Ensure the Safety of the Factory
    After paying attention to uniting technical personnel, capitalist thinking of purely technical viewpoints developed in individual leading cadres. After the No. 6 generator of the factory was damaged, especially after the machine had been repaired, but wood chips were found in the rotor, the General Branch immediately determined that this was a political issue that must be paid close attention to. Therefore, the General Branch reported this issue to the higher-level Party committee. The higher-level Party committee agreed with the General Branch's opinion and immediately instructed the factory through relevant administrative departments to seriously investigate this issue. However, even at this time, the General Branch Committee's understanding was still inconsistent. Some people advocated immediately investigating and cleansing the saboteurs in the factory; some people opposed it, saying: "Are we taking a political risk or a technical risk?" The latter meant that if some technical personnel with political problems were transferred out, it would be a technical risk; if they were not transferred out, it would be a political risk. They advocated taking a political risk rather than a technical risk. The General Branch seriously discussed this issue and sternly criticized the erroneous thinking of "rather take a political risk than a technical risk." The Party unanimously believed that technology must have political guarantees. The General Branch handed this issue over to all Party members and production activists for discussion and solicited their opinions. The correct opinions of the General Branch were immediately warmly supported by all the workers, and everyone unanimously said: "The eyes of the Communist Party are sharp, and bad guys should have been cleansed long ago." After the bad elements were cleansed, the workers happily said: "Shijingshan was liberated in 1948, and we were liberated in 1950!" After this struggle, the line between the enemy and ourselves was drawn clearly in the entire factory, ensuring the completion of the production tasks of the entire factory and greatly improving the political vigilance of the masses of workers.
    In ensuring the implementation of the Party's and the state's other policies and plans, the General Branch of the Shijingshan Power Plant also carried out arduous ideological education work. This ideological education work was sometimes carried out through various specific tasks, and sometimes through various movements, such as in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country, the General Branch conducted an in-depth patriotic ideological education for all employees. All Party members and workers are often educated by the Party's socialism, and their class consciousness has rapidly improved, which has guaranteed and supervised the realization of the production plan. More than 170 worker cadres have been trained and promoted. Wang Wenbin, an old worker of the plant, was appointed as the deputy director of the plant and was elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Liu Dezhen was elected as a national labor model. The workers said: "Dead machines can no longer command us living people." They truly recognized that they are the masters and creators of the world.

　　一个国营工厂的党的工作
    ——记中共石景山发电厂总支的思想教育工作
    本报记者  培蓝
    中共北京市石景山发电厂总支部，经常注意对全体共产党员、全体工人进行社会主义教育，逐步提高了党员与工人的阶级觉悟，从而监督与保证了国家生产计划的实现。
  经过党内外充分的思想教育  发动全体职工减低了煤耗率
    北京石景山发电厂中最大的问题之一，是煤耗高，成本高。去年五月，该厂实际煤耗比中央燃料部的定额高百分之五·四。该厂中共总支曾集中力量，专门解决这个问题。总支事先作了深入的调查研究，特别是向熟悉这个问题的工人作了研究。从研究分析中，确定了现在的煤耗是可以降低的，同时计算了降低煤耗的具体数字。于是提出了“为降低煤耗至每度电○·七八公斤而斗争”的口号，并号召全厂在六月份开展劳动竞赛，订立集体合同，开展合理化建议，以实现这一口号。
    这时总支又接连召开了几次会议，讨论研究订集体合同问题。在讨论中，曾虚心学习了苏联先进的订集体合同的经验。苏联的先进经验是：订合同要有百分之九十的人数参加。总支书记王自勉按照该厂工人的觉悟程度，确定了在大多数职工已懂得订合同的意义后，就可签订合同。但是有个别干部，却认为必须有百分之九十以上的职工完全懂得集体合同的意义后才能签订。这种思想虽然发生在个别干部身上，但是很值得注意，因为它是一个如何把先进经验与具体情况相结合的问题。总支召开了总支委员会，专门讨论这个问题，厂长刘英源说：“订合同总比不订好。”这就把这个问题解决了。在会议上通过了发动职工签订集体合同的决议。总支部把这一决议，先交给全体共产党员研究讨论，随后又交给全体职工讨论。有些工人说，订了合同，行政和工会就分了家；有些工人说订合同是包工活；表示不很同意。对于开展合理化建议，一部分职工思想上抵抗得也很厉害。有些人说，“提合理化建议是小米脑袋”。有些人害怕提出合理化建议后，生产效率提高了，自己可能失业。个别工人甚至去质问提出合理化建议的工人，说：“几十年的饭碗要被你们弄掉了”。对于这些障碍签订集体合同与改进技术的思想，总支曾经进行了深入的说服教育，解除工人各种思想顾虑；坚决支持厂长刘英源的意见；又在职工代表会上，通过了合理化建议的奖励办法，打开了技术改进的门路。总支通过党员，积极推动工会，发动工人，订立小组计划；发动党员、团员学习马恒昌小组的先进经验，带头订好小组计划。总支直接领导各分支，培养典型小组，推动全厂的工作。共产党员刘德珍首先带领小组，向全厂检修小组挑战。梁凤昌小组向煤粉炉其他两班挑战。蔡学成小组向全厂运转工友挑战。个人与个人、组与组、车间与车间、值班与值班（每天三班轮流值班，每班值八小时，值班不同于一般的班）的劳动竞赛展开了，合理化建议开始出现了。这时总支的注意重点，即转入推动工会，深入检查各小组计划的执行情况，并督促行政检查工作质量。总支还利用上党课的时间表扬先进，批评落后，动员全体党员，保证这一任务的完成。结果，煤耗以○·七六八超额完成任务，成本大大降低。汽机厂修理班刘德珍小组六月份超过计划百分之八十五·九；煤粉炉梁凤昌小组创造了十个月未灭一次火的新纪录。修理场翻砂部废品率由百分之四十降低到百分之三·五八。汽机场运行班蔡学成小组八个月未发生任何事故。六月份全月出现了一百五十件新纪录，提出九十二件合理化建议。经过这次劳动竞赛，该厂开始制定了新的生产标准；工会、行政摸着了面向生产的门路；总支则从实际经验中，进一步明确地认识了必须加强思想教育，从思想上发动工人群众，搞好生产。广大职工通过六月合同，真正认识了自己的智慧与力量，认识了共产党领导的正确。
    发动工人力量以降低煤耗，只是石景山发电厂注意思想教育的一个例子。实际上，该厂总支从来就是比较注意对职工进行社会主义教育的。当然在进行社会主义教育的过程中，常常需要在党内党外进行激烈的思想斗争，以保证党与政府的方针政策的实现。
  总支委员会注意研究思想情况  通过阶级教育加强了职工团结
    他们常常是经过很激烈的思想斗争。例如，在该工厂接收后不久，曾经发生了如何对待技术人员问题。当时有些技术人员不了解党与政府的政策，工作上消极应付，不负责任。某助理工程师就这样说：“上班前后转游转游，四个钟头处理事务，两个钟头应付应付。”而若干党员、工人，认为这些技术人员情况复杂，自高自大，对他们采取了不理不睬甚至排挤的态度。有些领导干部，则认为技术人员是宝贝，对他们既不督促，又不批评，采取了完全“放任自流”的态度。总支分析了干部、党员、工人与技术人员的思想情况，及时提出了团结技术人员的口号。首先在干部中进行教育，克服歧视技术人员与无原则迁就技术人员的思想，初步扭转了干部、党员和工人对技术人员的不正确的态度。同时对技术人员进行了政治教育，提高他们为人民服务的觉悟，并吸收觉悟较高的技术人员听党课，列席总支委员会。这些技术人员看到党内严格的批评与自我批评，普遍反映：“共产党就是严格，这样才能进步。我们要好好学习！”总支又有计划地慎重地吸收了个别已够党员标准的技术人员入党，使全体职员真正体会到“职员是工人阶级的一部分”，因而解除了思想顾虑，工作情绪逐渐高涨，感觉党对他们是重视的。技术人员李常熹担任了汽机场主任以后，工作十分积极，领导全场创造了三个月没有重要事故的新纪录。技术员王振宇深入现场，研究碎煤机的情况，提出增加碎煤细度的意见，结果就降低了煤耗。工程师于运海主动参加五号机的大修工作，亲自动手解决了动平衡的问题。
  纠正了单纯技术观点的错误  清洗坏分子保证了工厂的安全
    注意了团结技术人员后，在个别领导干部中，又发展了单纯技术观点的资本主义思想。该厂六号发电机被破坏后，特别是该机业已修好，但又发现回转子内有木片的事实后，总支立即断定这是一个政治问题，必须十分注意，于是，就把这个问题向上级党委汇报了。上级党委同意总支的意见，当即通过有关行政部门指示该厂认真检查这个问题。但是，就在这种时候，总支委员中的认识还是不一致的。有人主张立即清查和洗刷厂内的破坏分子；有人提出反对意见，他们说：“我们是要政治冒险呢？还是技术冒险呢？”后一种人的意思是，如果把某些有政治问题的技术人员调出去，是技术冒险，不把他们调出去，是政治冒险。他们是主张宁可政治冒险的。总支十分严肃地讨论了这个问题，肃格地批判了所谓“宁可政治冒险，不能技术冒险”的错误思想。党内一致认为技术必须有政治上的保证。总支把这个问题，交给全体党员和生产积极分子去讨论，征询他们的意见。总支的正确意见立即得到全体工人的热烈拥护，大家一致表示：“共产党的眼睛是雪亮的，坏家伙早就该清洗了。”而在清洗了坏分子后，工人愉快地说：“石景山是一九四八年解放的，我们是一九五○年解放的！”经过这个斗争，在全厂划清了敌我界限，保障了全厂生产任务的完成，大大提高了工人群众的政治警惕性。
    在保证党的、国家的其他方针、计划实施时，石景山发电厂总支也都进行了艰苦的思想教育工作。这种思想教育工作，有时是通过各种具体工作进行的，有时是通过各种运动进行的，如在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，总支就对全体职工进行了一次深入的爱国主义思想教育。全体党员、工人经常受到党的社会主义的教育，他们的阶级觉悟很快地提高了，这就保证与监督了生产计划的实现。并且培养与提拔了一百七十多名工人干部。该厂老工人王文斌担任了副厂长，被选为北京市人民政府委员。刘德珍则被选为全国劳动模范。工人们说：“死机器再也不能指挥我们这些活人了。”他们真正地认识了自己是主人翁，是世界的创造者。
