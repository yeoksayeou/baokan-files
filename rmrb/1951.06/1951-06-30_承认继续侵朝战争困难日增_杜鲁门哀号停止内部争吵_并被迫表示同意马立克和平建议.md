　　Acknowledging the Increasing Difficulties of Continuing the War of Aggression Against Korea
    Truman Laments the Cessation of Internal Disputes
    and is Forced to Express Agreement with Malik's Peace Proposal
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 28th] U.S. President Truman delivered a policy speech on June 25th in Tullahoma, Tennessee, on the anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Korea. He continued to defend the U.S.'s aggressive policy toward Korea, attempting to encourage the entire war camp, which had failed in the Korean War, to continue its aggression to the end.
    As usual, Truman began by trying to "prove" the "necessity" of the United States' consistent pursuit of an aggressive policy since the end of World War II, especially its armed aggression against Korea and China. Then, he used lengthy and false words to embellish the United States' disastrous defeat in Korea. However, he had to admit that, after a year of fighting, the division of the imperialist camp and the United States' own difficulties had become increasingly apparent. He said: It is "not easy" to make so-called "free nations" sell their lives for the United States, it is "not easy" to "hold the line" in Korea, and "we are not out of danger."
    Next, Truman used unprecedentedly rude words to attack his opponents, attempting to quell the growing disputes within the U.S. ruling group due to the failure of the war of aggression against Korea. Here, he expressed great fear that this dispute might widen the rift between the United States and its vassal states. To this end, he did not hesitate to scold this group of "people who want to create division and chaos," because they might cause the United States to wage World War III "alone," and the United States "must have strong allies" if it wants to fight a major war. He said: "Unfortunately... there are some people in our own country who are trying to make us 'go it alone'. Some people here are spreading suspicion of our allies and exaggerating the differences between us and them." He scolded some people for allegedly "deliberately putting political struggle above the country" and "trying to turn the people against the government by spreading fear, slander, and lies." He also demanded that the Republican Party "truly express loyalty" and "stop using the despicable efforts to agitate fear and suspicion of our foreign policy to seek political gain." He said bitterly: "There should be no difference between Democrats and Republicans in foreign policy." Truman thus exposed the so-called "unity" that he himself and other U.S. government representatives had embellished, and showed the extent to which the disputes within the U.S. ruling group had developed after MacArthur's dismissal, and how fragile the relationship between the United States and its vassal states had become.
    At the end of his long speech advocating the continuation of the war of aggression against Korea, Truman had to express his agreement with the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by Soviet Representative to the Security Council Malik on the 23rd, saying that he was also "willing to participate in the settlement of the Korean issue."

　　承认继续侵朝战争困难日增
    杜鲁门哀号停止内部争吵
    并被迫表示同意马立克和平建议
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国总统杜鲁门于六月二十五日美国侵朝战争周年在美国田纳西州突拉火玛发表政策演说，继续为美国的侵略朝鲜的政策辩护，企图鼓励在朝鲜战争中失败了的整个战争阵营继续侵略到底。
    杜鲁门照例一开头就竭力“证明”美国自第二次世界大战结束以来一贯推行侵略政策特别是对朝鲜与中国实行武装侵略的“必要”。然后，他就以冗长而虚伪的言辞来粉饰美国在朝鲜的惨败。但是，他又不得不承认：在打了一年之后，帝国主义阵营的分裂和美国自身的困难都已越来越大了。他说：要使所谓“自由国家”替美国卖命“并不容易”，要在朝鲜“守住阵线”也“并不容易”，“我们尚未脱离危险”。
    接着，杜鲁门就用空前粗暴的话来攻击他的反对派，企图以此平息美国统治集团内部由于侵朝失败而日甚一日的争吵。在这里，他对于这种争吵可能扩大美国与其附庸国间的裂痕一点，表示了极大的恐惧。为此，他不惜破口痛骂这批“想制造分裂和混乱的人”，因为据说他们可能使美国“单独地”来进行第三次世界大战，而美国如果要打大战却“必须有强大的盟国”。他说：“不幸……在我们本国也有些人正在想使我们‘单独干’。这里有些人正散布对我们盟国的猜忌，并夸大我们同它们之间的分歧。”他骂有些人据说是“故意把政争放在国家之上”，“试图用散播恐惧、诽谤和谎言的办法来使人民反对政府”。他并且要求共和党“真正表示忠诚”，“停止用鼓动对于我们外交政策的恐惧和怀疑的办法来谋取政治利益的卑鄙努力”。他恨恨地说：“在外交政策方面不应该有民主党人和共和党人的区别。”杜鲁门这样就拆穿了他自己以及其他美国政府代表所粉饰的所谓“团结一致”，并且表明了美国统治集团内部的争吵在麦克阿瑟撤职后已发展到了什么程度，美国与其附庸国间的关系又脆弱到了什么程度。
    杜鲁门在他这篇鼓吹继续侵朝战争的长篇演说的末尾，不得不表示附和苏联驻安全理事会代表马立克于二十三日提出的和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，表示也“愿意参加朝鲜问题的解决”。
