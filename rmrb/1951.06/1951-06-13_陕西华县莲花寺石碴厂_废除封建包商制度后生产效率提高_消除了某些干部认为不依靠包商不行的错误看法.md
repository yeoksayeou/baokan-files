    Production Efficiency Improves After Abolishing the Feudal Contractor System
    Eliminates the Mistaken View of Some Cadres That It is Impossible to Do Without Contractors
    After the Shaanxi Huaxian Lotus Temple Stone Slag Factory abolished the feudal contractor system, workers' lives improved and production efficiency greatly increased. This fact eliminated the mistaken view of some people that it is impossible to do without contractors, and provided an example for future work in abolishing the feudal contractor system in various places.
    The Lotus Temple Stone Slag Yard is the main production site for stone used in the western section of the Longhai Railway. It originally had more than 4,000 workers. In the past, under the exploitation and oppression of feudal contractors, the lives of the workers were extremely painful. Contractor boss Yin Yucheng deducted more than 50 percent of workers' wages every month for more than ten years, and a total of 53 workers died from his abuse. After this situation was exposed, in October of last year, the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and other relevant departments, together with the Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, formed a working committee to go deep into the site and assist the local people's government and trade union in investigating and handling the matter. After three months of effort, by December, the feudal contractor system had been completely abolished. After the feudal contractor system was abolished, the lives of the workers were immediately improved. In the past, the workers could not get enough to eat, but now they can eat three catties and four taels of noodles per person per day. The workers used to live in dilapidated straw sheds last winter, but now they have moved into newly built houses. The stone slag yard also organized a workers' welfare society to provide workers with cheap daily necessities. As a result, the workers' enthusiasm for production has been increasing day by day. During the contractor period, each person averaged only 0.3 cubic meters of ballast per day, but now the average is 0.5 cubic meters, and the most can even reach more than 1 cubic meter. The quality pass rate has also increased from 40 percent to more than 80 percent. In April of this year, the workers of the yard launched a patriotic labor competition, actively improving ballast-smashing techniques under the slogan "The stone yard is the battlefield, and smashing more stone slag is equivalent to eliminating more enemies." In April, the entire yard successfully completed the task of smashing 80 carloads of stone slag per day, and three model teams and eighteen labor models emerged. The average individual output of the model teams has reached more than one cubic meter, the quality pass rate has reached more than 90 percent, and tool consumption has been reduced by two-thirds compared with before.
    In the process of abolishing the feudal contractor system in the Lotus Temple Stone Slag Yard, the working committee composed of the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, etc., first selected a production unit with more than 900 people for a typical experiment, canceling the sixteen kinds of feudal exploitation of workers by feudal contractors, reforming the food management of the workers, adjusting the "窝子" (nests) and production tools, and changing the labor organization, which greatly enlightened the workers' awareness. Then, the working committee cultivated activists against the feudal contractor system in various production units throughout the yard. After full deliberation by all the workers, a mass rally of workers in the entire yard was held to denounce the feudal contractor system, and the government legally dealt with the feudal contractor bosses. After the feudal contractor system was abolished, the working committee adopted the method of "people-run, government-assisted," selecting activists from among the workers to serve as managers, implementing a democratic appraisal and more-work-more-pay wage system, and running short-term training classes to train activists among the workers. After a period of time, after exploring some management experience, the working committee further mobilized the workers to expose and eliminate the corrupt elements and lawbreakers lurking among the workers, and finally consolidated the victory of abolishing the feudal contractor system.
    Note: At present, there are still many stone slag yards for railway use across the country that have not abolished the feudal contractor system. The reason is that some local government cadres and trade union cadres believe that the composition of workers in the stone slag yards is complex, their thinking is backward, they have high mobility, and they cannot be organized. They are afraid that after the feudal contractor system is abolished, the workers will not be able to manage well and will not be able to fully supply the railway needs. However, the fact that the workers of the Lotus Temple Stone Slag Yard have a high enthusiasm for labor and greatly improved production efficiency after the abolition of the feudal contractor system proves that the views of these cadres are extremely wrong.

    废除封建包商制度后生产效率提高
    消除了某些干部认为不依靠包商不行的错误看法
    陕西华县莲花寺石碴场废除封建包商制度后，工人生活获得改善，生产效率大为提高。这一事实，消除了某些人认为不依靠包商不行的错误看法，给各地今后废除封建包商制度的工作提供了一个榜样。
    莲花寺石碴场是陇海西段铁路用石的主要产地，原有四千多工人，过去在封建包商的剥削压迫下，工人生活极其痛苦。包商头殷钰丞十几年来每月克扣工人工资百分之五十以上，前后共有五十三名工人受他虐待致死。这一情况被揭发后，去年十月，西北军政委员会劳动部、西北总工会、陕西省总工会及其他有关部门即会同郑州铁路管理局西安分局组成工作委员会，深入现场，协助当地人民政府和工会调查处理。经过三个月的努力，至十二月份即全部废除了封建包商制度。封建包商制度废除后，工人生活随即得到改善。工人们过去吃不饱，现在每天每人已能吃到三斤四两面。工人们去年冬天还住在破草棚里，现在已搬入新盖的房子中住。石碴场并组织了工人福利社，供给工人廉价的日用品。因此，工人生产情绪日益高涨。包商时期每人每天平均只打零点三方道碴，现在平均能打零点五方，最多的甚至打到一方多，质量合格率也由百分之四十提高到百分之八十以上。今年四月该场工人展开爱国主义劳动竞赛，在“石场就是战场，多打石碴就等于多消灭敌人”的口号下，积极改进打碴技术。四月份全场胜利完成了每天打八十车石碴的任务，出现了三个模范小组和十八位劳动模范。模范小组的个人平均产量已达一方以上，质量合格率达百分之九十以上，工具损耗较前减少三分之二。
    西北军政委员会劳动部、西北总工会等组成的工作委员会，在废除莲花寺石碴场封建包商制度的工作过程中，首先选择一个九百多人的生产单位作典型试验，取消了封建包商对工人的十六种封建剥削，改革了工人们的伙食管理，调整了“窝子”和生产工具，改变了劳动组织，大大启发了工人们的觉悟。然后，工作委员会就在全场各生产单位培养反封建包商制度的积极分子，经全体工人充分酝酿，始召开全场工人的控诉大会，宣布废除封建包商制度，并由政府依法处理了封建包商头子。封建包商制度废除后，工作委员会即采取“民办公助”的办法，选拔工人中的积极分子充当管理人员，实行民主评议、多劳多得的工资制度，并开办短期训练班，训练工人中的积极分子。经过一个时期，在摸索到一些管理经验后，工作委员会又进一步发动工人检举，清除了潜藏在工人中的贪污分子和不法分子，终于使废除封建包商制度的胜利得以巩固。
    按：目前全国各地还有不少铁路用石的石碴场尚未废除封建包商制度，其原因是当地某些政府干部和工会干部认为石碴场工人成分复杂、思想落后、流动性大、组织不起来，怕废除封建包商制度后，工人们管理不好，不能充分供应铁路需要。而莲花寺石碴场废除封建包商制度后，工人劳动热情高涨、生产效率大大提高的事实，却证明这些干部的看法是极端错误的。
