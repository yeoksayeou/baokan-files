　　Continue to Promote High-Speed Cutting Method
　　Workshop Production Efficiency Doubles the Highest Level Since the Patriotic Labor Emulation Campaign

　　Workers at the Tianjin Automobile Assembly Plant have successfully adopted the advanced Soviet high-speed cutting method using existing machines and tools. The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions Mechanical Technology Research Association held a demonstration on May 20th to showcase their work. During the demonstration, they used the plant's existing vertical milling machine and tools to mill flat plates, increasing efficiency by 22 times compared to the past. They also used a Japanese-style eight-foot lathe and a diamond steel knife (a type of high-speed steel knife) to turn internal combustion engine eccentric shafts and crankshafts, increasing efficiency by 12.5 times. The efficiency of the tool for turning piston rings was also increased by 7 times.

　　This outstanding achievement was first made by worker Xing Deyu. After the plant's workers returned from watching the high-speed cutting demonstration in Beijing, they were concerned that the advanced Soviet cutting methods could not be applied in their own factory. Some said, "Our machines can't compare to the Soviet ones; I'm afraid they're not up to the task!" Others said, "High-speed cutting requires cemented carbide tools, and I'm afraid our kind of tools won't work!" Some were also afraid that overusing the machines would damage them. Others worried about the workpieces overheating if the cutting depth was too deep. But Xing Deyu thought, "The experiences of the Soviet Union and Northeast China prove that cutting speeds can be increased even under existing equipment conditions. How long will we have to wait to completely replace our machines and tools!?"

　　So Xing Deyu began his experiments in his spare time. He disassembled the high-speed steel tool from a Japanese-style six-foot lathe and ground it to the negative rake angle he had heard about during the demonstration in Beijing. He boldly increased the speed from 31 revolutions to 250 revolutions. At this time, he saw the machine spinning rapidly, with sparks flying from the iron filings, and his heart was pounding with nervousness. He carefully examined the lathe, which remained stable. He touched the workpiece and found that it was not only free from high heat and deformation, but also flatter and smoother than before. Only then did he feel relieved. The job that used to take six hours to complete was now completed in just three and a half hours.

　　After hearing the news of Xing Deyu's initial success, engineer Jin Kui and worker Kou Wenbao voluntarily drew up drawings based on books on high-speed cutting methods to guide Xing Deyu, help him grind the tool angles more precisely, and help him solve many technical problems. Next, Xing Deyu began the second and third repeated experiments on a Japanese-style eight-foot lathe. With the specific help of engineer Jin Kui, Xing Deyu overcame difficulties such as the low motor power and the light bar's inability to drive the tool post at high speed. The results of the second and third experiments greatly improved the cutting efficiency compared to before. Work that used to take twelve hours was completed in three hours.

　　Now the workers in the plant's tool department are learning from Xing Deyu, and the spindle speeds of many machines in the workshop are increasing dramatically. The workshop's production efficiency has generally doubled the highest level since the patriotic labor emulation campaign. The working efficiency of milling worker Wang Yulin has increased by as much as 21 times.

### 天津汽车装配厂工人  继续推行高速切削法  车间生产效率比爱国劳动竞赛以来最高时提高了二倍

　　天津汽车装配厂工人
    继续推行高速切削法
    车间生产效率比爱国劳动竞赛以来最高时提高了二倍
    天津汽车装配厂工人用原有机器、刀具，采用苏联先进的高速切削方法，获得成功。天津市总工会机械技术研究会曾在五月二十日举办表演会请他们表演。表演时，他们用厂内原有的立式铣床和刀具铣平板，效率比过去提高达二十二倍；又用日本式八英尺车床和钻石钢刀（高速钢刀的一种）车内燃机偏心轴和曲轴，效率比平常提高达十二倍半，车活塞环工具的效率也提高了七倍。
    这一优异成就是首先由工人邢德禹取得的。该厂工人在北京看完高速切削表演会回厂后，都顾虑苏联先进切削方法不能在自己厂里应用。有的说：“咱这床子可比不了苏联的，怕不够条件吧！”有的说：“搞高速切削法应该使用硬质合金刀具，咱这种刀怕不准能行！”也有人怕把机器用过了力，使机器受到损失；也有人考虑工作物吃刀太深，会不会发热。但邢德禹心里却想，苏联和东北的经验证明，在现有的设备条件下，也可以提高切削速度。要完全换新机器、新工具，那要等到什么时候呢！？
    于是邢德禹在业余时间开始了他的试验工作。他把一部日本式六英尺车床的高速钢刀具拆下来，照着在北京参观表演时听说的角度磨成了负前角装上。他又把车速由三十一转大胆地开到二百五十转。这时他看到机器飞快地转动着，铁屑火花四射，他紧张得心直跳。他仔细看了看车床，车床依然那样稳固，摸了摸工作物，不但未发高热，未变形，而且比过去更加平板光滑。他这才放了心。这次切削的活，在过去是要用六小时才能完成的，但现在只用三个半小时就完成了。
    工程师金奎和工务员寇文宝听到邢德禹试验初步成功的消息后，主动地根据讲高速切削法的书籍，画了图样，来指导邢德禹，帮助他把刀子的角度磨得更加精确，并帮助他解决了许多技术问题。接着邢德禹在日本式八英尺车床上开始了第二次、第三次的反复试验。由于得到金奎工程师的具体帮助，邢德禹又克服了马达力量小、光杠在高速时带不动刀架等困难。第二次和第三次试验的结果使切削效率较以前大为提高。过去需要十二小时的工作三小时内便完成了。
    现在该厂工具部工人都在向邢德禹学习，车间里许多机器主轴的转数都在惊人地增加着。车间的生产效率已比爱国主义劳动竞赛以来最高时普遍提高了二倍。铣工王玉林的工作效率竟提高了二十一倍。
