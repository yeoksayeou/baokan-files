　　Communist Party members, village cadres, labor models, cooperative members, and cotton farmers in the six suburban districts of Shijiazhuang actively responded to the call of the People's Government and the Communist Party, selling or storing their cotton to the state promptly. On the morning of June 10th, as early as possible, one hundred and seventy-four Communist Party members, village cadres, labor models, and activists, pulling carts, pushing wheelbarrows, carrying or lifting ginned cotton and seed cotton, gathered with big red flags from ten villages to the cotton collection points. Many cotton bales also fluttered with small red flags with the words "Sell Cotton to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" and "Store Patriotic Cotton."
    In order to encourage these patriotic farmers, the Sixth District People's Government held a grand welcoming meeting. Labor model Zhao Minglai, on behalf of Xisanjiao, challenged the villages in the Sixth District at the meeting, guaranteeing that all the stored cotton in the village would be sold or stored to the state. He said: "In the past, the big landlords stored cotton and refused to sell it, regardless of workers' unemployment and the lack of food and clothing for the vast majority of people. Now that the land belongs to us ordinary people, we should take out the cotton when the country needs it; we cannot forget who led us to take back the land from the landlords and helped us prosper." Dong Shugu, a representative of the cooperative, said: "We have already benefited greatly from growing cotton last year, and we will definitely take out all of our stored cotton. We must turn the cotton fields into battlefields, use sprayers as weapons, eliminate our enemies – aphids, and strive for an even greater cotton harvest this year, and defeat American imperialism as soon as possible." The meeting resounded with passionate slogans: "Support the State Council's instructions on purchasing and storing cotton, respond to the Central Committee of the Communist Party's call for selling and storing cotton, and launch a cotton selling and storing competition!" "Improve technology, strengthen production, strive for a bumper harvest, donate airplanes and artillery, and completely eliminate American imperialism!" Then, representatives from various villages responded one after another, guaranteeing to sell or store all the stored cotton to the state.
    Everyone took out their stored cotton with a high degree of patriotism. The cooperative prepared a large amount of cash and materials to welcome the cotton sellers. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Cotton Exchange also sent people to cooperate with the work. After the meeting, scales were hung and cotton was collected at the entrance of the cooperative, and cotton bales blocked the road. Even in the busy wheat harvest season and the hot weather, everyone persisted until after four o'clock in the afternoon. While inspecting the grade, weighing, and processing the procedures, they were paying and picking up goods at the same time. According to the cooperative's statistics: a total of 4,650 catties of seed cotton and more than 890 catties of ginned cotton were collected in one day; more than half of them were stored, and a small portion was cashed or exchanged for goods (grain, cloth, coal and other necessities). The cotton farmers expressed great satisfaction with the state's cotton purchasing and storage methods, and expressed that they would vigorously promote it to the cotton storage households after returning, and a large number of stored cotton will be sold to the state one after another. The patriotic actions of cotton farmers in Zhentou Village and other villages in the district have now been commended by the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government.

　　石家庄市郊六区各村棉农        
    成群结队售储棉花       
    展开卖棉存棉竞赛
    石家庄市郊六区各村共产党员、村干部、劳动模范、合作社员、棉农积极响应人民政府和共产党的号召，把存棉迅速卖给或存给国家。六月十日一大早，一百七十四位共产党员、村干部、劳动模范、积极分子，大车拉着、小车推着、抬着或提着皮棉、籽花，扯起大红旗，结着队，从十个村子向收棉处集中。许多棉花包上还飘着写着“售抗美援朝棉花”“储爱国棉花”字样等的小红旗。
    六区人民政府为了鼓励这些爱国农民，特别举行了隆重的欢迎大会。劳动模范赵明来在会上代表西三教向六区各村挑战，保证把全村所有存棉都拿出来卖给或存给国家。他说：“过去大地主们存着棉花不卖，不管工人失业，也不管广大人民没吃穿。现在土地成了我们老百姓的，我们存着棉花，国家需要就应当拿出来；我们不能忘记谁领导我们从地主手里夺回了土地，扶助我们发了家。”合作社社员代表董述古说：“去年种棉已经得了很大好处，我们存棉一定全部拿出。要把棉田作战场，喷雾器当武器，消灭我们的敌人——蚜虫，争取今年棉花更大的丰收，早日打败美帝国主义。”会场响起一片激昂的口号声：“拥护政务院购棉储棉指示，响应中共中央售棉存棉号召，开展卖棉存棉竞赛！”“提高技术，加强生产，争取丰收，捐献飞机大炮，彻底消灭美帝国主义！”接着各村的代表都纷纷应战，保证把存棉全部卖给或存给国家。
    大家以高度的爱国热情，拿出了存棉。合作社准备了大批现款和物资，迎接卖棉户。花纱布公司、棉业交易所亦派人前去配合工作。会后就在合作社门口挂秤开收，棉花包堵塞了大路。虽在麦收活忙天又热的季节里，大家一直坚持到下午四点钟以后。一边验级过秤开手续，一边就付款、取货。据合作社统计：一天中共收籽棉四千六百五十斤，皮棉八百九十多斤；其中存了一半以上，一少半支了现款或换了货物（粮、布、煤等生活必需品）。棉农对国家购棉、储棉办法极表满意，纷纷表示回去后大力向存棉户进行宣传，大批存棉将陆续售给国家。该区振头等村棉农们这种爱国行动，现已受到石家庄市人民政府通报表扬。
