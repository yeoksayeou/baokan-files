　　The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) local committees of Baoding, Dingxian, and Xingtai prefectures in Hebei Province, the main cotton-producing areas, upon receiving the instructions from the State Council of the Central People's Government regarding cotton purchasing and storage work, and the instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee on ensuring the victorious completion of this task, immediately convened meetings, made decisions, and specifically deployed the work of carrying out cotton purchasing and storage. The Baoding local committee requested that each county implement a system of leadership responsibility, treating cotton purchasing and storage as the current shock task. It demanded that Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in all areas engage in mutual mobilization and challenge competitions, and proposed the slogan "Strive to be a model in selling and storing cotton." After receiving instructions, the Dingxian local committee immediately notified the Party county committees of each cotton-producing county by telephone, striving to complete this work before the wheat levy. It also requested that Party members and League members in the cotton-producing areas of the entire prefecture should first sell or store their own cotton to the state, thereby driving a mass patriotic movement of selling and storing cotton. The Xingtai local committee convened a special meeting on the 2nd to discuss the cotton purchasing and storage instructions. The meeting believed that in the past cotton purchasing work, the Party committees at all levels in the prefecture only paid attention to verbal propaganda and did not elevate the cotton farmers' sale of cotton to the state to the height of patriotism; they regarded the task of cotton purchasing only as a matter for the economic departments, lacking earnest organization and promotion, and the strength of the economic departments had not kept up. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the Party local committee requested that the county committees convene a series of meetings of branch Party members, cotton farmer bumper harvest households, cotton planting models, etc., to extensively carry out political propaganda activities. In particular, it required that each county and district vigorously and repeatedly publicize patriotism and the cotton-grain price ratio policy to cotton farmers, using specific accounting methods to break the cotton farmers' ideological concerns.

　　中共河北省保定、定县、邢台地方委员会
    布置购棉储棉工作
    号召党员团员向棉农进行爱国主义宣传
    【本报三日专电】河北省主要棉产区的保定、定县、邢台三个专区的中国共产党地方委员会，当接到中央人民政府政务院关于购棉储棉工作的指示及中共中央委员会、中共河北省委员会关于保证此项任务胜利完成的指示后，立刻召集会议，做出决定，具体布置开展购棉储棉工作，保定地方委员会要求各县实行首长负责，把购棉储棉作为当前的突击任务。要求各地共产党员、青年团员展开互相动员，挑战竞赛，并提出了“售、储棉花争模范”的口号。定县地方委员会于接到指示后，立即用电话通知各产棉县党的县委员会，争取麦征前做好这一工作。并要求全区产棉区的党员、团员，要首先把自己的存棉出售或储存给国家，并由此带动起一个群众性的爱国主义售棉、储棉运动，邢台地方委员会于二日召开了专门会议，讨论购棉储棉指示。会议认为专区各级党委在过去的购棉工作中只注意了口头宣传，没有把棉农卖棉花给国家提高认识到爱国主义的高度；把收购棉花任务只看成经济部门的事情，缺乏认真的组织推动，各经济部门的力量也没有跟上去。为克服以上缺点，党的地方委员会要求各县委员会召开支部党员、棉农丰产户、种棉模范等一系列的会议，广泛展开政治上的宣传活动。就中特别要求各县、区大力向棉农户反复宣传爱国主义和棉粮比价政策，用具体的算账办法，打破棉农思想上的顾虑。
