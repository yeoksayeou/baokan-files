　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] People from all walks of life in the capital are actively carrying out the three movements called for by the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea: promoting patriotic pacts, donating airplanes and artillery, and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. In recent days, mass meetings have been held by various levels of the population, with a total of 144 meetings. Representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea were invited to attend and give reports. The 287,000 people who participated in these meetings, after hearing about the moving deeds of the heroic fighting of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the indomitable spirit of the Korean people, as well as the brutal crimes of American imperialism against the Korean people, unanimously expressed their determination to support the Korean front with practical actions and to deeply develop the patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. Many people, after reading the call of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea in the newspapers, responded quickly and enthusiastically. Workers in many factories spontaneously donated money. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Beijing Postal Administration, and railway workers in the Beijing area are planning to donate airplanes or tanks independently. The Liu Dezhen group, responsible for the steam turbine repair at the Shijingshan Power Plant, decided to repair a certain generator ahead of schedule. The plant's employees have requested that the trade union quickly organize a donation committee to support the volunteer army, so that they can donate a "Shijingshan Workers' Aircraft" or tank together with the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Shop assistants in the Fifth District of Beijing have also launched a campaign to donate a "Chinese Shop Assistants' Aircraft". More than 700 employees of the Beijing Postal Administration unanimously passed a resolution at the report meeting to donate a "Beijing Postal Workers' Aircraft."

　　After passing a resolution to support the front with airplanes, artillery, etc., the industrial and commercial circles are separately planning to actively raise donations. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions convened an enlarged cadre meeting on the 4th. Liu Laifu, vice chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the enthusiastic response of workers in various factories and enterprises to the call of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea. He requested that all factories conduct a thorough inspection of the implementation of the patriotic pacts signed in the past, and, in accordance with the call of the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and the instructions in the People's Daily editorial, supplement or revise them to make the patriotic pacts a deeper and more concrete action program for resisting America and aiding Korea. He pointed out that the movement to donate airplanes and artillery must be fully prepared among the masses, plans must be made, and it must be closely integrated with the movement to increase production. The Capital Air Defense Force, the North China Artillery Force, and the Capital Public Security Force have all launched donation campaigns and have established patriotic pacts to actively train troops. All teachers and students of the Normal University have decided to donate a "Normal University Aircraft." The Huiven Middle School Education Union unanimously resolved to launch a campaign to donate a "Teachers and Staff Aircraft" and called on educators across the country to work together to complete the donation. At the meeting, 5.5 million yuan was donated on the spot. Many students at Tsinghua University are determined to donate their income from after-school work. Students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering completed 411 blueprints and forms for a certain factory ahead of schedule and donated all the remuneration of more than 2 million yuan.

　　Yuan Jing and Kong Jue of the Central Film Bureau's Scriptwriting Institute jointly sent a letter to the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea on the 4th, offering 10 million yuan in manuscript fees for the purchase of a "Lu Xun Aircraft." They also guaranteed to actively create works resisting America and aiding Korea, and will continue to donate manuscript fees in the future.
