　　Cotton purchasing and storage work is underway in the Central South region. The Central South Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company signed an agreement with the Cooperative Affairs Administration, stipulating that from June to August this year, cooperatives in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces will purchase 40,000 dan of cotton. Local cotton yarn and cloth companies are purchasing cotton in cotton-producing areas. The Hubei Tianmen Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company organized purchasing teams, going deep into rural areas, combining with land reform work teams to publicize and dispel farmers' concerns; and combined with village farmers' associations, establishing purchasing groups by village; by early May, a total of 25,000 jin of cotton had been purchased. The Henan Huaiyang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company closely contacted local administrative departments, and the company's leading cadres personally went to Taikang County to lead cotton purchasing, so the May cotton purchasing plan was well completed. In addition, in May, Zaoyang, Tianmen, Jingshan, and Jiayu in Hubei Province, Xia邑 and Minquan in Henan Province, and Yiyang and Changde in Hunan Province received a total of more than 18,000 dan of local cotton purchases and agricultural tax surcharges of cotton.

　　中南购棉工作展开
    淮阳花纱布公司完成五月份计划
    中南区购棉储棉工作正在展开。中南花纱布公司与合作事业管理局签订协议，规定今年六月至八月，河南、湖北、湖南、江西四省合作社收购棉四万担。各地花纱布公司正在产棉地区收购棉花。湖北天门花纱布公司组织收购小组，深入农村，与土地改革工作队结合宣传，打破农民顾虑；并与各村农会结合，以村为单位成立收购组；在五月上旬，共已收购棉花二万五千斤。河南淮阳花纱布公司与地方行政部门密切联系，该公司领导干部并亲到太康县领导购棉，所以五月份购棉计划很好地完成了。此外，湖北省枣阳、天门、京山、嘉鱼，河南省夏邑、民权，湖南省益阳、常德等地，在五月份接收地方购棉和农业税附加棉共一万八千余担。
