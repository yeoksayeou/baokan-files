　　The Chinese Communist Party Branch of Henggu Village, Fengnan, Hebei
    Mobilizes the Entire Village's Cotton Farmers to Store 17,000 Jin of Cotton
    The cotton farmers of Henggu Village, Fengnan County, Hebei Province, launched a movement to sell and store cotton for the state on June 4th. Within four days, the entire village's cotton farmers had stored a total of 17,300 jin of cotton. The main reason this cotton selling and storage movement progressed so quickly was the strengthening of leadership by the village cadres. On June 4th, Wang Qingjun, the secretary of the village branch, convened a meeting of the branch committee and Party and Youth League members, explaining the great significance of selling and storing cotton. He took the lead by storing his own 150 jin of cotton with the state on the spot. On the 5th, he led Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists, divided into groups and areas, to carry out propaganda throughout the village, dispelling the cotton farmers' concerns and making them realize that selling and storing cotton for the state was a major event. As a result, the cotton farmers took out their cotton and stored it in the cooperative. Zhang Zheyuan, a well-to-do middle peasant, found the branch secretary and said, "I understand this time! I should take out the cotton and sell it to the state! I still have more than 300 jin of cotton stored, which I stored the year before last. I will take it all out and sell it to the state." Currently, the entire village has stored more than 17,000 jin of cotton. The cotton selling and storage movement is continuing to develop in depth. (Shi Guang)

　　河北丰南横沽村中共支部        
    动员全村棉农存棉万七千斤
    河北丰南县横沽村的棉农，从六月四日展开向国家卖棉存棉的运动，四天以内，全村棉农共储存了一万七千三百斤棉花。这村售棉储棉运动开展得这样快，主要原因是村干部加强了领导。六月四日，村支部书记王庆俊召开支部委员会和党员、团员会议，说明售棉储棉的重大意义，把自己存的一百五十斤棉花当场存给国家。五日，他又领导党员、团员、宣传员，分组分片在全村展开宣传，打破棉农的顾虑，使棉农认清了向国家卖棉存棉是大事，棉农于是纷纷拿出棉花，存在合作社里。富裕中农张泽远找到支部书记说：“我这回明白啦！应该把棉花拿出来卖给国家！我还存着三百多斤棉花，是前年存的，我全拿出来卖给国家。”现在全村已经储存了一万七千多斤棉花。售棉储棉运动还在继续深入开展。（石光）
