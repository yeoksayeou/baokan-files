More than 20 Mutual Aid Teams in Xingping County
Plan to Shorten Wheat Harvest Time to Help Families of Military Personnel with Wheat Harvesting

In Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, 47 agricultural production mutual aid teams have completed all preparations for wheat cutting and seed selection two to five days ahead of schedule according to their planned competition schedule. The Zhang Mingliang Mutual Aid Team in Sanhe Village, after issuing a challenge, completed the threshing ground leveling and repaired all farm tools within seven days. The Zhai Bingzhang Mutual Aid Team in Zhu Dong District added 42 additional summer harvest tools such as brooms and sickles this year compared to last year. The Xu Jingzhang Mutual Aid Team in Douma Village, which planted 66.3 mu of "302" wheat, had performed pre-selection work such as removing impurities and inferior plants twice. The Wu Zhenwu Mutual Aid Team in Wen'an District hoed the cotton fields twice after completing the preparations for summer harvest and summer selection. Mutual aid teams in Douma Village, Xinbaozi, and other places have established nurseries during the busy farming season to organize female labor to participate in summer harvest and summer selection. In addition, more than 20 mutual aid teams out of the 47 mutual aid teams have also developed specific work plans to improve labor efficiency, shorten the wheat harvest time, and prepare to use the remaining labor to help the families of martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and working cadres in various villages with wheat harvesting. The team members participating in the militia have now begun patrolling and guarding to protect the wheat harvest.

　　兴平县二十多个互助组
    计划缩短麦收时间帮助军人家属收麦
    陕西省兴平县四十七个农业生产互助组，已按照预定竞赛计划提前两天或五天完成了割麦和选种的一切准备工作。三合村张明亮互助组在提出挑战后七天内，就碾好了场地，并把农具修补齐全。祝东区翟炳章互助组，今年比去年多添置了四十二件扫帚、镰刀等夏收农具。窦马村许敬章互助组所种六十六亩三分“三零二”号小麦，曾做过两次去杂、去劣等预选工作。文安区吴振武等互助组在完成夏收、夏选准备工作后，又锄了两次棉田。窦马村、新堡子等地的互助组举办了农忙托儿所，把妇女劳动力组织起来参加夏收、夏选工作。此外，在四十七个互助组中有二十多个互助组还订出了具体的劳作计划，提高劳动效率，缩短麦收时间，准备将剩余的劳力帮助各村烈士、革命军人、工作干部家属收麦。各组参加民兵的组员现已开始巡逻放哨，保护麦收。
