Following the successive holding of seven native product exhibition and exchange fairs in various provinces, regions, and cities of East China, the Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Fair, concentrating over 10,000 kinds of native products from the entire region and major native products from all over the country, grandly opened on the 10th. The number of visitors on the first day of the fair reached over 114,000. Rao Shushi, Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He pointed out that land reform has now been completed in areas with nearly 100 million agricultural population (accounting for 81% of the total agricultural population of East China), and land reform in the entire region will be fully completed by the end of this year. Shanghai and other cities in the Jiangnan region have completely shattered the encirclement of feudal forces and gained the support of the vast democratic countryside. At the same time, Shanghai and other cities in the Jiangnan region have eliminated the aggressive forces of imperialism, and have become basically independent and autonomous cities, not only politically and culturally, but also economically. Now the production enthusiasm of farmers in various places has been unprecedentedly high, not only has the production of grain and cotton increased, but the production of other native and special products has also recovered significantly. Therefore, how to help farmers sell these products and exchange them for the means of production and livelihood they need has become our most urgent task. This is not only related to the production and life of the vast number of farmers and handicraftsmen, but also a major condition for the further improvement of urban industry and commerce and the entire national economy. In his speech, Chairman Rao Shushi expressed his hope that representatives from all regions, under the leadership and assistance of the People's Government, would expand the exchange of native products and the exchange between urban and rural areas in accordance with the principles of unity, mutual assistance, fairness, and reasonableness, and strive to achieve further improvement of the national economy and thoroughly crush the economic blockade of US imperialism in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

This conference was sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and is scheduled to last for one month to one and a half months, with a very large scale. The Municipal People's Government mobilized more than 2,000 construction workers and more than 5,000 experts, technicians, art workers, and public and private trade personnel, and spent two months building and arranging sixteen exhibition halls and more than 200 retail stores on the 600-acre racecourse in the city center, enough to accommodate 150,000 visitors every day. The sixteen exhibition halls start with the "Urban and Rural Exchange Hall." In this hall, electric neon lights, models, charts, and slides are used to focus on the historical situation of the production, transportation, and sales of native products with a total annual value of 15 trillion yuan in the entire region, the recovery situation after liberation, the current problems, the relationship between expanding the sales of native products and the economic life of the country and the people, the policies of the People's Government, and the future development prospects. The other fifteen exhibition halls are divided into five units according to the category of native products, with two to four exhibition halls in each unit, systematically showing the magnificent picture of the motherland's rich products and the industrious wisdom of the working people. The native products displayed in each hall focus on the slow-selling goods that account for 30% to 40% of the total value of native products in the entire region, and especially introduce the experience of opening up sales channels for slow-selling products through efforts, and the problems of slow-selling goods that have not yet opened up sales channels.

The conference organized a native product exchange and introduction office, organizing representatives from inside and outside the region who came to visit to conduct transactions or sign transaction agreements. Major administrative regions and major cities across the country have sent delegations and visiting groups composed of public and private commercial representatives, and transported a large number of samples to Shanghai, preparing to conduct large transactions with Shanghai and various parts of East China.

Xinhua News Agency: The East China Native Products Conference convened by the East China Financial and Economic Committee will also be held in Shanghai on June 15th, with a scheduled duration of half a month. More than 700 representatives of native product operators from all over East China (80% of whom are private business representatives) have now arrived and have begun to visit the Shanghai Native Products Exhibition and Exchange Fair in an organized manner. This meeting will prepare sufficient conditions for the peak season of urban and rural exchanges this autumn.

　　上海市土产展览交流大会开幕
    饶漱石主席号召为实现国家经济进一步的好转
    及彻底粉碎美帝国主义的经济封锁而努力
    紧接着华东各省、区、市先后举办了七个土产展览交流大会之后，集中全区一万多种土产和全国各地主要土产的上海市土产展览交流大会已在十日隆重揭幕。大会第一天的参观人数达十一万四千多人。华东军政委员会饶漱石主席在大会揭幕典礼上致词。他指出：现在华东区近一亿农业人口（占华东全部农业人口的百分之八十一）的地区已经完成了土地改革，全区土地改革将在今年年底全部完成。上海及江南各城市已经完全粉碎了封建势力的包围，而获得了广大民主农村的支援。同时，上海及江南各城市已经扫除了帝国主义的侵略势力，不但在政治上、文化上，而且也在经济上，已基本上成为独立自主的城市。现在各地农民的生产积极性空前提高，不仅粮、棉增产，就是其他土产特产品的生产也有很显著的恢复。因而，如何帮助农民把这些产品推销出去，并换回农民需要的生产资料和生活资料，已成为我们当前最迫切的任务。这不仅关系到广大农民和手工业者的生产和生活问题，而且也是城市工商业和整个国家经济进一步好转的主要条件之一。饶漱石主席在致词中希望各地代表在人民政府的领导和帮助之下，按着团结互助和公平合理的原则，扩大土产交流、城乡交流，在抗美援朝运动中，为实现国家经济进一步的好转及彻底粉碎美帝国主义的经济封锁而努力。
    这次大会由上海市人民政府主办，为期预定一个月到一个半月，规模很大。市人民政府曾动员了二千多个营建工人和五千多个专家、技师、美术工作者及公私贸易人员，在市中心占地六百亩的跑马场上，以两个月时间，建造和布置了足够每天容纳十五万人参观的十六个展览馆，二百多所零售商场。十六个展览馆以“城乡交流馆”为起点。这个馆内用电动的霓虹灯、模型、图表和幻灯片等，集中说明了全区每年生产总值十五万亿元的土产运销的历史情况，解放后的恢复情况和目前的问题，以及扩大土产推销对国家人民经济生活的关系，人民政府的政策，未来的发展景象等。其他十五个展览馆按土产类别分成五个单元，每个单元各有两个到四个展览馆，系统地展现出祖国物产丰富、劳动人民勤劳智慧的宏丽画面。各馆陈列的土产，都以占全区土产总值百分之三十到四十的滞销货为重点，特别介绍滞销品中经过努力而打开销路的经验，和还未打开销路的滞销货的问题。
    大会组织了土产交流介绍所，组织前来参观的区内外代表进行交易，或签订交易协议。全国各大行政区和各重要城市都已派来了公私商业代表共同组成的代表团和参观团，运大批货样到达上海，准备与上海及华东各地进行大宗交易。
    又讯：华东财政经济委员会召开的华东区土产会议也将于六月十五日在上海举行，为期预定半个月。出席会议的华东各地土产经营者的代表七百多人（其中百分之八十是私商代表）现已到达，并已开始有组织地参观上海市土产展览交流会。这次会议将为今秋城乡交流旺季准备好充分条件。
