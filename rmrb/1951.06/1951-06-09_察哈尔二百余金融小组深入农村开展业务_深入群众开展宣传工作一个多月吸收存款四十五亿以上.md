The Chahar Branch of the People's Bank of China has widely established financial teams in rural areas. After February of this year, the number of financial teams rapidly increased from twenty-five to two hundred and nineteen. By mid-April, these teams had played a significant role in absorbing farmers' deposits, activating rural capital, developing agricultural production, and accelerating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This work has been enthusiastically welcomed by the vast number of farmers. At the end of last year, the total private deposit balance in Chahar Province was less than 2.5 billion yuan; this time, the financial teams absorbed 4.53629 billion yuan in just over a month. Last year, the highest private deposit balance in the Charnan area was 800 million yuan, but the financial teams absorbed 1.6 billion yuan in just over a month. In addition, the province's financial teams also exchanged 15,145 silver dollars and 2,182 taels of silver, and insured 19,579 head of livestock. In terms of loans, the financial teams issued a total of 3.055 billion yuan (including 1.427 billion yuan in agricultural loans). Of this, 70% was used for agricultural production, helping farmers solve difficulties with seeds, fertilizers, livestock, farm implements, and pesticides. Chabei used loans to organize the export of 550,000 jin of grain; Charnan used loans to organize the export of tobacco, white hemp, eggs, bristles, reed mats, and other materials, and brought back many textiles and sundries for the farmers.

The Chahar Province's rural financial teams' experience includes the following points:

One, after arriving in a village, it is necessary to deeply understand the political and economic situation of the village, the ideological situation, specific difficulties, and demands of the masses through meetings with cadres, meetings with the masses, and individual visits to farmers. Then, through cadres, primary school teachers, and labor models, widely publicize the work using men's and women's schools and places where the masses gather, so that the masses understand what the bank wants to do and the benefits of this work for the country and for the farmers themselves.

Two, work with village cadres and rely on the masses to carry out business. The business of the Penyao Village Financial Team in Wanxian Second District was carried out through Wang Lian, a member of the CCP village branch committee. Wang Lian helped the financial team absorb more than 4 million yuan in deposits and also helped find loan recipients. The Zhangbei Financial Team mobilized local veterinarians and the masses to identify livestock, enabling livestock insurance to proceed smoothly. Other tasks such as grain price quotations, loan applicant reviews, livestock evaluations, and grain storage are all handled through village cadres and relying on the masses.

Three, combine with central work and make unified arrangements. Cadres from the Yannan Branch of the Bank of China not only did financial work in the villages but also did central work such as mobilizing soaking and mixing seeds. In addition to doing central work, Party and government cadres also helped carry out financial business. This ensured that both central work and financial work were successful.

Four, combine with trade and cooperative departments to handle the absorption of physical objects. The financial team operating in Xiaonantou, Datong, signed a contract with the cooperative for 5,000 jin of rice seeds. It was agreed that the bank would be responsible if the absorption was insufficient, and the cooperative would be responsible if it could not be exported. The Shangdu Branch agreed with the grain company that the company would purchase grain deposited by the financial team at a price 5 yuan higher than the market price per jin, and send a purchasing team to work with the financial team to ensure that the physical objects were processed quickly and in a timely manner.

Five, after the activities of the financial teams, "take root" in the villages, establish village financial committee members or financial committees, and establish mass credit organizations when conditions permit. The financial teams themselves are led by the branch or business office. When conditions are ripe, they are prepared to gradually become fixed. This enables farmers in various regions to contact the bank proactively at any time.

　　察哈尔二百余金融小组深入农村开展业务
    深入群众开展宣传工作一个多月吸收存款四十五亿以上
    中国人民银行察哈尔省分行在农村普遍建立金融小组。今年二月以后，金融小组从二十五个迅速发展到二百十九个。到四月中旬，在吸收农民存款、活跃农村资金、发展农业生产、加速城乡物资交流上，起了很大作用。这项业务受到广大农民热烈欢迎。去年年底察哈尔全省私人存款余额不足二十五亿元；这次金融小组一个多月即吸收了四十五亿三千六百二十九万元。察南专区去年私人存款最高余额为八亿元，金融小组一个多月就吸收了十六亿元。此外，该省金融小组还兑换白洋一五一四五枚，白银二一八二两，办理牲畜保险一九五七九头。放款方面，金融小组共放出三十亿五千五百多万元（内有农贷十四亿二千七百多万元）。其中百分之七十用于农业生产，帮助农民解决种籽、肥料、牲畜、农具、农药等困难。察北用贷款组织了粮食五十五万斤输出；察南用贷款组织了烟叶、白麻、鸡蛋、猪鬃、苇席等物资输出，并给农民带回许多布匹、杂货。
    察哈尔省农村金融小组的活动经验，有以下几点。
    一、到村后要经过干部会、群众会和个别访问农民，深入了解村中政治、经济情况，群众的思想情况、具体困难和要求，然后经过干部、小学教员和劳动模范等，利用男女民校和群众聚集场所广泛宣传，使群众了解银行要做什么工作，这些工作对国家和对农民自己的好处。
    二、和村干部一起，依靠群众开展业务。万全二区盆窑村金融小组的业务，是通过中共村支部委员王连进行的。王连帮助金融小组吸收了四百多万元的存款，还帮助找好贷款对象。张北金融小组动员土兽医和群众来鉴别牲口，使牲畜保险能顺利进行。其他如粮食牌价、贷户审查、牲畜评价、粮食保管等工作，都是通过村干部、依靠群众办理的。
    三、结合中心工作，统一布置。察南延庆支行干部到村，除做金融工作外，也做发动浸种、拌种等中心工作。党政干部除做中心工作外，也帮助开展金融业务。这样使中心工作和金融工作都做出了成绩。
    四、结合贸易、合作部门，处理吸存的实物。在大同小南头活动的金融小组，与合作社订立稻籽五千斤的合同。约定吸收不够由银行负责，输不出去由合作社负责。商都支行与粮食公司约定：由公司以每斤高于市价五元收购金融小组吸存的粮食，并派收购小组结合金融小组进行活动，使实物处理迅速及时。
    五、经过金融小组的活动，在各村“扎根”，建立村的金融委员或金融委员会，在条件许可时建立群众信用组织。金融小组本身，受支行或营业所领导。条件成熟时，准备逐渐固定起来。这样就使各地农民能随时主动地和银行联系。
