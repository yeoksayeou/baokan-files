(II) Guidelines and Tasks for 1951
Based on the national financial and economic policies and guidelines, investment plans, and the actual situation and objective needs of the textile industry in 1951, the guidelines for the textile industry in 1951 should be: increase production, improve management, focus on key construction, and prepare for development.

Based on the above guidelines, the tasks for 1951 are formulated as follows:

1. Production Plan: Based on the needs of the people nationwide, the capacity of machinery and equipment, and the supply of raw materials, further implement planned production. The production figures for national, joint public-private, and private textile factories nationwide are as follows:
    A. Cotton Yarn - Production of various yarn counts will increase by 25.35% compared to 1950. Among them, state-owned enterprises will increase by 13.69%, joint public-private enterprises will increase by 31.01%, and private enterprises will increase by 39.39%.
    B. Cotton Cloth - Production of various cloths will increase by 79.71% compared to 1950. Among them, state-owned enterprises will increase by 20.33%, joint public-private enterprises will increase by 60.76%, and private enterprises will increase by 59.11% (hand-woven not included).
    C. Printing and Dyeing Processing - Various bleached cloths, printed cloths, and colored cloths will increase by 33%.
    D. Gunny Sacks - National production of gunny sacks will increase by 126.1%. Among them, state-owned enterprises will increase by 151.78%, and private enterprises will increase by 76.08%.
    E. Wool Textiles - The national production of woolen fabrics, industrial felts, knitting wool, etc., will temporarily be based on the actual output of 1950.
    F. Silk - In coordination with relevant departments, conduct comprehensive surveys and research, continue production, improve quality, and reduce costs in order to strive for overseas sales.
    G. Rayon - Conduct small-scale experiments and gradually restore the rayon factory in Shanghai to train technical staff.

2. Capital Construction: The state-owned factory sector will carry out key construction in accordance with the 1951 capital construction investment plan of the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee, and conduct preliminary surveys and designs in developing areas to prepare conditions for future development:
    A. Newly built yarn factories will add 162,000 new spindles.
    B. Manufacture 2,000 looms.
    C. Build a textile machinery manufacturing factory, striving to complete 30% of the entire project within the year, and draw a complete set of new textile drawings.
    D. Continue to build the Northeast Flax Manufacturing Factory and flax raw material factories, and restore the gunny sack factory, printing and dyeing factory, and cotton textile factory under construction in the Northeast.
    E. Move 16,480 woolen spindles and two wool washing machines from Shanghai to the Northwest. This year, preparatory work such as relocation, surveying, and design will be carried out first.
    F. Organize the manufacturing of cotton spinning machines and their auxiliary machines - strengthen the organization and leadership of national public-private textile machinery manufacturing factories so that they can gradually increase the production of spindles to meet the needs of expanding new factories.
    G. Continue to complete the drawing work for new types of wool and flax machinery.
    H. Survey the sites and design for new cotton, wool, and flax factories to prepare conditions for construction in 1952.
    I. Strictly implement the instructions of the Government Administration Council's Financial and Economic Committee regarding designing before construction, strengthen organizational leadership, and promptly summarize experiences to improve work.
    J. In addition to state-owned enterprises, encourage private capital to increase new equipment in the interior and provide necessary assistance.

3. Based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, and in accordance with national raw material supply, machinery and equipment capacity, and market sales conditions, rationally allocate raw materials and operating days. Organize orders for the wool textile industry and textile machinery manufacturing industry. Strengthen guidance to private factories, and maintain close contact with trade associations. Continue to convene professional meetings on textile machinery manufacturing, cotton, wool, silk, flax, artificial fibers, printing and dyeing, and auxiliary equipment, as well as technical specialized meetings on cotton and wool inspection and grading, maintenance, and operation methods, in order to further improve and advance technology and management.

4. Train Cadres and Technicians: To prepare talent for the future development of the textile industry, and to equip the new factories built in 1951 with cadres, the current number of management personnel and technical personnel in each factory is insufficient. Therefore, training cadres should be listed as one of the main tasks in the future. The general requirement for 1951 is to train 500 intermediate management cadres and technical cadres, and 12,000 technicians and skilled workers. Each region can transfer technicians with a certain level of education, add short-term training, and cultivate them; strengthen political education for existing technical personnel and management personnel; give cadres who originally participated in industrial work from the liberated areas opportunities to learn business and technology, and promote cadres with a certain level to deputy positions so that they can be trained in practical work. In addition, each region should, based on its actual situation, hold spare-time technical training classes, short-term technical training classes, and professional training classes in public and private factories to train a new batch of management cadres and technical cadres.

5. Continue to improve factory management and lay the foundation for implementing the economic accounting system:
    Among the administrative cadres of state-owned textile factories, further carry out ideological education on relying on the working class to do a good job in production, conduct education on the leadership method of "coming from the masses and going to the masses," strengthen the work effectiveness of the factory management committee and the employee representative meeting, clarify the respective responsibilities of the administration and the trade union, so that the work can be closely coordinated to achieve the goal of improving production and improving labor protection. Strengthen the organization of labor-capital consultation meetings in private textile factories to promote the relationship between labor and capital and strengthen worker solidarity. In order to enable these tasks to be carried out well, continue to carry out the patriotic production competition movement in public and private factories, organize experience exchanges, promote and popularize rationalization proposals, strengthen the responsibility system, implement the reward and punishment system and the principle of employee service, and establish various necessary systems to improve labor discipline. In terms of labor conditions and labor protection and welfare, urge public and private factories to add necessary safety devices, improve temperature, humidity, and hygiene conditions, etc., in accordance with the principle of need and possibility, and allocate a certain percentage of labor protection and welfare funds.

    Technical Management: First, study past and Soviet advanced experience, conduct quota determination nationwide, gradually bring various technical quotas to reasonable standards, and improve machinery and equipment, and adjust labor organization to change the abnormal phenomenon of relying solely on labor intensity to increase output in the past. Second, diligently implement the maintenance system, conduct regular inspections and repairs, and extend the service life of machines.

    Financial Management: State-owned factories implement a unified financial system, strictly implement the income and expenditure plan and currency management system; pilot the factory director fund; at the same time, promote public and private factories to strengthen cost accounting, save raw materials, reduce management expenses, and reduce costs by 1% to 2%. And expand piece-rate wages as much as possible and implement time-based performance appraisal.

    Business Management: Organize the allocation of raw materials, improve processing standards, study market conditions, closely combine supply, production, and sales, improve the insurance and warehouse management system of state-owned textile factories, and subsidize private factories to further improve management institutions to adapt to the needs of planned production.
