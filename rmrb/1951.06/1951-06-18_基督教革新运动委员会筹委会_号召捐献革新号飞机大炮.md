Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th. The Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of the Chinese Christian Church, in response to the call of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, issued a notice on the 16th to Christian churches and organizations throughout the country, calling on Christians nationwide to generally establish and examine patriotic covenants before the end of June, to donate aircraft and cannons named "Christian Reform" within half a year, and to do a good job in providing preferential treatment and pensions to the families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled veterans.

The notice stated: (1) Christian churches and organizations in all parts of the country that have already established patriotic covenants should examine whether the patriotic covenants have been effectively implemented; patriotic covenants that are not practical should be revised and supplemented; those that have not yet established patriotic covenants should widely publicize and educate all believers and organize extensive discussions to formulate practical patriotic covenants. Christian churches and organizations in all regions should generally establish and examine patriotic covenants before the end of June, and generally conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the results of implementing patriotic covenants in January next year. When Christian churches and organizations establish and revise patriotic covenants, they should pay attention to: strengthening the education of believers in patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea sentiments, especially in conjunction with sermons; expanding the accusation movement against the crimes of American imperialism using Christianity to invade China, exposing imperialist elements and degenerates within the church, strengthening learning, actively participating in patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea actions, and striving to promote the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of Christianity. (2) Regarding the donation of aircraft and cannons: Christians across the country must respond enthusiastically to the call of the China Resist America, Aid Korea General Association to donate aircraft and cannons with the spirit of "sell your clothes and buy a sword" as commanded by Jesus Christ, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors. Christians across the country should donate aircraft and cannons named "Christian Reform" to express our patriotic and religious zeal. Donations should be combined with increased production. Christians may have already participated in donations in their own production units, but for the sake of patriotism and love for the church, we Christians should contribute more. The donation period is half a year and can be paid in installments. All units should quickly formulate specific plans for publicity and mobilization for donations. Christian churches and organizations in various regions can directly send monthly donations to the local People's Bank while notifying the local Resist America, Aid Korea branch and writing to our association (131 Huqiu Road, Shanghai) for statistics. (3) Christians should do a good job in providing preferential treatment and pensions to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary military personnel, and disabled veterans, which is an unshirkable duty. Every church in the country should investigate whether there are families of revolutionary martyrs or revolutionary military personnel among its members, and mobilize everyone to care for and help them with great love. We should also actively participate in the work of providing preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and military personnel in our own regions.

　　号召捐献革新号飞机大炮
    【新华社上海十七日电】中国基督教抗美援朝三自革新运动委员会筹备委员会为响应抗美援朝总会的号召，特于十六日向全国各地的基督教教会与团体发出通知，号召全国基督徒在六月底以前普遍订立与检查爱国公约，在半年内捐献以“基督教革新号”命名的飞机、大炮，做好优待与抚恤烈属、军属、荣誉军人的工作。
    该通知称：（一）全国各地的基督教教会与团体，凡是已经订立爱国公约的，要检查爱国公约是否已经切实执行；不切合实际的爱国公约要加以修正并补充；尚未订立爱国公约的，要向全体信徒们普遍宣传教育并组织广泛讨论，订出切实可行的爱国公约。各地基督教教会与团体，要在六月底以前普遍订立与检查爱国公约，并在明年一月普遍举行执行爱国公约成绩的总评定。基督教教会与团体在订立与修正爱国公约时，均应注意到：加强对信徒们的抗美援朝爱国主义的教育，特别应与讲道配合起来；扩大对美帝国主义利用基督教侵略中国罪行的控诉运动，检举教会内帝国主义分子与败类，加强学习，积极参加抗美援朝爱国行动，努力推进基督教三自革新运动等。（二）关于捐献飞机大炮方面：我们全国的基督教徒要以耶稣基督所吩咐的：“你们要卖衣服买刀”的精神，来热烈响应抗美援朝总会捐献飞机大炮的号召，彻底打败美国侵略者。我们全国基督徒要捐献以“基督教革新号”命名的飞机与大炮，以表现我们爱国爱教的热忱。捐献应该与增加生产相结合。基督徒或者已经在自己的生产单位上参加了捐献，但是为了爱国爱教，我们基督徒应多拿一分力量出来。捐献以半年为期，可以分期缴款。各单位应迅速订立具体的宣传和动员捐献的计划。各地基督教教会与团体，可以一面将每月捐款直接送交当地人民银行，一面通知当地的抗美援朝分会，一面写信通知我会（上海虎丘路一三一号），以便统计。（三）基督教徒要做好优待和抚恤革命烈士家属、革命军人家属与荣誉军人的工作，这是一件义不容辞的事。全国每个教堂应调查自己教友中有无革命烈士家属、革命军人家属，要动员大家以伟大的爱心来照顾他们，扶助他们。对于自己地区内的优抚烈属、军属工作，我们也应该踊跃地参加。
