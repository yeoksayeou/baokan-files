(I) Commemorating the Party's 30th Anniversary Requires Studying the Party's History

    On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, the majority of the nation's Party newspapers, Party reporters, propagandists, and other Party propaganda forces are making the history of the Communist Party of China the main content of current propaganda. This is in line with the needs of the broad masses of Party members and non-Party members.

    Party organizations at all levels should earnestly lead Party members in conducting a preliminary study of the Party's history around "July 1st." The study materials are the commemorative essays published by leading comrades of the Party Central Committee, especially "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" by Hu Qiaomu and "Mao Zedong Thought is the Combination of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese Revolution" by Chen Boda. The history of the Party is a textbook combining Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution and is an introduction to studying Mao Zedong Thought. Every Communist Party member and all those who wish to understand Communism must earnestly study the history of the Communist Party of China, and the 30th anniversary of the Party should lay a preliminary foundation for this study. As Comrade Hu Qiaomu said in "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," the 30-year history of the Communist Party of China "is a history of the great victory of Marxism-Leninism in a large country accounting for about a quarter of the world's population, in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country; it is a history of the Chinese working class leading the broad masses of peasants and other democratic forces in heroic struggles against imperialists and their running dogs, experiencing a long period of difficulties and twists and turns, and finally overthrowing their reactionary rule, establishing a people's democratic republic led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, thereby opening up a smooth road to a socialist future."

    The significance of studying the history of the CPSU (B) pointed out in the introduction to the "Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" is equally applicable to us. This introduction says:

    "Studying the history of the CPSU (B) enables us to understand the rich experience of our country's workers and peasants in their struggle for socialism.

    "Studying the history of the CPSU (B), studying the history of our Party's struggle against all enemies of Marxism-Leninism and against all enemies of the working masses, helps to master Bolshevism and enhances political vigilance.

    "Studying the heroic history of the Bolshevik Party means arming oneself with knowledge of the laws of social development and political struggle, and with knowledge of the driving forces of revolution.

    "Studying the history of the CPSU (B) strengthens the confidence in the ultimate victory of the great cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and the confidence in the victory of communism throughout the world."

    Our Party organizations at all levels should also earnestly understand this spirit when organizing and leading the study of Party history, and help Party members, cadres, and the masses understand the experience of the Chinese working class and its party in leading the broad masses of peasants and other democratic forces in the struggle for New Democracy; study the experience of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in struggling against various opportunist ideas and against the enemies of the people in various complex historical environments; familiarize themselves with the laws of Chinese social development and political struggle; and further strengthen their understanding of the Communist Party of China and the far-reaching prospects of communism, and enhance their confidence in the cause of Chinese revolution and construction.

    Party members should receive a preliminary education in the history of the Party's struggle around the commemoration of "July 1st." To help Party members and cadres study, Party committees in various localities should hold lectures on the history of the Party, using the historical facts of each specific revolutionary stage to help Party members study the Party's history and arouse their motivation and interest in studying Party history. If this step is carried out well, it can lay the foundation for Party members and cadres to further study the history of the Party and even the various works of Comrade Mao Zedong.

    When commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party and studying the concise history of the Party, Party organizations in various localities should carry out ideological education work in light of the current ideological situation within the Party. We should criticize and correct the current erroneous tendencies of some comrades who neglect Party work, neglect politics, neglect relying on the working class, and neglect political education for Party members, workers, and peasants.

    Around "July 1st," organizing Party members to recall the history of struggle is also an important auxiliary way to study Party history. For this purpose, Party grassroots organizations in various localities can convene various forms of meetings, especially lively and active recollection evenings. At such recollection evenings, Party members can be organized to express their recollections of the history of the Party, Chairman Mao, other Party leaders, and the revolutionary martyrs' struggles, and introduce model branches and model Party members. In short, every Party member should be determined to strive for a higher standard of Communist Party member and to fight for upholding the communist ideological principles among Party members during the great 30th anniversary commemoration of the Party.

### （一）纪念党的三十周年应当学习党的历史

  （一）纪念党的三十周年应当学习党的历史
    中国共产党三十周年纪念日的前夕，全国多数党报、党的报告员、宣传员和其他党的宣传力量，都把中国共产党的历史作为目前宣传的主要内容。这是适合广大党员以及党外群众的需要的。
    各级党的组织在“七一”前后，都应当认真地领导党员对党的历史作一次最初步的学习。学习的材料是党中央领导同志所发表的纪念论文，特别是胡乔木同志所作的“中国共产党的三十年”和陈伯达同志所作的“毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义与中国革命的结合”。党史是马克思列宁主义同中国革命具体实践相结合的教科书，是学习毛泽东思想的入门。每一个共产党员以及一切愿意了解共产主义的人们，都必须认真地学习中国共产党党史，而党的三十周年纪念，就应当为这种学习打一个初步的基础。中国共产党三十年奋斗的历史，正如胡乔木同志在“中国共产党的三十年”一文中所说的，“是马克思列宁主义在一个约占世界人口四分之一的大国中，在一个半殖民地半封建的国家中得到伟大胜利的历史；是中国工人阶级领导着广大的农民和其他的民主力量，向帝国主义者及其走狗作英勇斗争，经历长时期的艰难曲折，终于推翻了他们的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主共和国，从而为走向社会主义前途开辟了顺利道路的历史。”
    “苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”导言中所指出的学习联共党史的意义，对于我们同样是适用的。这个导言中说：
    “研究联共（布）的历史，就能领会我国工农为社会主义奋斗的丰富经验。
    “研究联共（布）的历史，研究我党同马列主义的一切敌人作斗争，同劳动群众的一切敌人作斗争的历史，就能帮助精通布尔什维主义，就能提高政治警觉性。
    “研究布尔什维克党的英勇历史，就是用通晓社会发展和政治斗争规律的知识武装起来，用通晓革命动力的知识武装起来。
    “研究联共（布）的历史，就是巩固确信列宁斯大林党伟大事业最终胜利的信心，确信共产主义在全世界胜利的信心。”
    我们各级党的组织，在组织与领导党史学习时，也都应当认真地领会这样的精神，帮助党员、干部和群众，了解中国工人阶级及其政党领导广大农民和其他民主力量，为新民主主义而奋斗的经验；研究党和毛泽东同志在各种复杂的历史环境中同各种机会主义思想进行斗争，同人民的敌人进行斗争的经验；熟习中国社会发展和政治斗争的规律；进一步加强对中国共产党和共产主义的远大前途的认识，增强对中国革命事业和建设事业的信心。
    党员在纪念“七一”前后应当受到一次最初步的党的斗争历史的教育。为了帮助党员和干部进行学习，各地党委都应当举行关于党的历史的讲演会，通过各个具体的革命阶段的历史事实，来帮助党员学习党的历史，引起他们学习党史的动机和兴趣。这一步进行得好，就可以使党员干部打下进一步学习党的历史以至毛泽东同志各种著作的基础。
    各地党组织在纪念党的成立三十周年和学习党的简要历史时，应当针对党内当前的思想情况去进行思想教育工作。应当批判和纠正目前某些同志忽视党的工作，忽视政治，忽视依靠工人阶级，忽视对党员和工人农民的政治教育的错误倾向。
    在“七一”前后，组织党员回忆斗争历史，也是学习党史的一个重要的辅助方式。为着这个目的，各地党的基层组织可以召开各种形式的会议，特别是生动活泼的回忆晚会。在这种回忆晚会上，可以组织党员对党、对毛主席和党的其他领导者、对革命先烈的斗争历史发表自己的回忆，介绍模范支部和模范党员。总之，应当使每一个党员在党的伟大的三十周年纪念中，下定决心为共产党员更高的标准而斗争，为坚持在党员中的共产主义的思想原则而斗争。
