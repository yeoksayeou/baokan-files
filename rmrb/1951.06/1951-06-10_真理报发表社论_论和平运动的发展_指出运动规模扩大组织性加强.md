　　*Pravda* Publishes Editorial
　　On the Development of the Peace Movement
　　Points Out the Expansion of the Movement's Scale and Strengthening of its Organization
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th] TASS, Moscow: The *Pravda* on the 8th published an editorial titled "The Firm Will of the People of All Countries to Defend Peace," saying: The movement of people all over the world to defend peace is developing day by day. The signatures of millions of people demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and the enthusiastic support for the resolutions of the World Peace Council, demonstrate the firm determination of the people of all countries to defend peace and smash the evil schemes of the warmongers. More than 246 million people in the People's Republic of China have signed the declaration for a peace pact. At the same time, the peace-loving Chinese people have organized and united to oppose the aggressive actions of American imperialism. People's democracies in Eastern Europe have widely launched signature campaigns. The people of these countries enthusiastically support the declaration for a peace pact and are stepping up their efforts to realize socialist construction plans. The editorial points out that a popular vote movement against German remilitarization and demanding a peace treaty this year has been launched throughout Germany. More than 13 million people in the German Democratic Republic voted in favor. About 90 percent of those who voted in West Germany and West Berlin voted in favor. In Italy, France, Austria and other capitalist countries, more and more people are supporting the peace pact and opposing the rearmament of West Germany. The people of the United States and Britain are protesting against the government's aggressive policies and demanding an end to the aggression against Korea and the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Germany and Japan. The struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries for national independence and peace has been strengthened day by day. The editorial concluded by saying that the preliminary results of the peace pact declaration signature campaign not only prove the expansion of the movement's scale, but also prove the strengthening of the movement's organization. The enemies of peace will never be able to prevent the development and growth of the movement to defend peace.

    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：八日真理报以《各国人民保卫和平的坚决意志》为题发表社论说：全世界人民保卫和平的运动正在一天天发展。千百万人民签名要求五大国缔结和平公约，和热烈拥护世界和平理事会的决议，显示了各国人民保卫和平及粉碎战争贩子罪恶阴谋的坚定决心。中华人民共和国已有二亿四千六百多万人在和平公约宣言上签了名。同时，爱好和平的中国人民已经有组织地团结起来反对美帝国主义的侵略行动。东欧各人民民主国家已广泛展开了签名运动。这些国家的人民热烈拥护和平公约宣言，并为实现社会主义建设计划而加紧奋斗。社论指出：德国全国各地已开展了反对德国重新军国主义化及要求今年缔结和约的人民投票运动。德意志民主共和国有一千三百余万人投了同意票。西德和柏林西区参加投票的人数中约有百分之九十投同意票。在意大利、法国、奥地利及其他资本主义国家，越来越多的人民拥护和平公约并反对重新武装西德。美国和英国的人民都抗议政府的侵略政策，并要求停止侵略朝鲜，缔结全面的对德和对日和约。殖民地和附属国家的人民为争取民族独立及和平的斗争已一天天加强了。社论最后说：和平公约宣言签名运动的初步成绩，不仅证明了运动规模的扩大，而且也证明了运动的组织性的加强。和平的敌人决阻止不了保卫和平运动的发展壮大。
