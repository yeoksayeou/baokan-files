　　The rural reading groups in Jiangxi Province have played a significant role in disseminating current events and policies in a timely manner.
　　The reading groups in the province began to be established last autumn during the land reform. After the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the reading groups developed greatly under the promotion of the CPC county and district committees. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 3,000 rural reading groups in the province.
　　The reading groups are generally organized by natural villages, voluntarily formed by heads of farmers' associations, members of the Communist Youth League, militia members, primary school teachers, and peasant masses, with an average of eighteen to twenty people in each group. Every evening, they gather in the farmers' association or village school, where a selected reader reads and explains current affairs. Then, through blackboard bulletins and oral propaganda, they spread important news to the whole village. For example, in Hufang Village, Huan'an Township, Nanchang County, five reading groups have been organized, with more than eighty farmers participating. After reading the newspaper, they select important news to write on the village's blackboard bulletin. They also stipulate that each member of the group must conduct oral propaganda to the masses. Under the frequent publicity and education of the reading group members, the farmers in the whole village have generally improved their understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea. In addition to the production plans that have already been established, the villagers have come up with a way to expand the publicity of resisting America and aiding Korea. Three hundred peasant households in the village have to weave six to seven hundred thousand oiled paper fans every year before summer and sell them to nearby towns and villages. In the past, the paper fans were painted with woodblock prints such as "Promotion Charts" and "Three Mothers Teach Their Son." This year, they decided to replace them all with new pictures related to resisting America and aiding Korea.
　　The result of reading newspapers and publicizing has promoted various tasks in the village. After reading the news about the arson incident by special agents in Lingling County, Hunan, the reading group members in many villages have become more vigilant and strengthened the anti-special agent work in their villages. The farmers' association in Xiaotang Village, Fengcheng County, also convened a meeting of all village militia members to discuss and decided that the militia should take turns guarding the fruits that had not yet been distributed after the land reform. Many rural reading groups have also dispelled some farmers' concerns about production by publicizing the people's government's production policies to them. Village cadres have also learned working methods from reading newspapers and solved the difficulties they encountered in their work. Everyone realizes that reading newspapers can "open up their minds" and "learn methods." When the reading group is reading the newspaper, many farmers come to listen. Every time they read the newspaper, the farmers are particularly concerned about the news reports on resisting America and aiding Korea, and especially like to listen to the communication reports about the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea. The reading group has now become an important organizational form for organizing the peasant masses to study current events and policies.

### 江西省的农村读报组

　　江西省的农村读报组
    江西省的农村读报组对及时传播时事、政策起了很大作用。
    该省的读报组是在去秋进行土地改革时开始建立的。抗美援朝运动开展后，在中共各县、区党委的推广下，读报组有了很大发展。据不完全统计，全省现有三千多个农村读报组。
    读报组一般都以自然村为单位，由农会主任、青年团员、民兵、小学教员和农民群众自愿组成，平均每组有十八到二十人。一到晚上，他们就聚集在农会或村学里由推选出来的读报员读、讲时事，然后通过黑板报和口头宣传将重大新闻传播到全村。如南昌县胡安乡胡坊村已组织了五个读报组，有八十多个农民参加。他们在读报后，选择重要新闻写在村的黑板报上。他们还规定组内每人都要向群众做口头宣传。在读报组组员的经常宣传教育下，全村农民普遍地提高了对抗美援朝的认识。全村除已经订立的生产计划外，农民们还想出了一个扩大抗美援朝宣传的办法。村里有三百户农民每年夏天以前要编制六、七十万把油纸扇推销到远近集镇农村去。过去纸扇上都画着“升官图”、“三娘教子”等木印图画，今年他们决定一律换上有关抗美援朝内容的新图画。
    读报和宣传的结果，推动了村里的各项工作。很多村庄的读报组组员在读了湖南零陵县特务纵火事件的新闻后，都提高了警惕，加强了本村的防特务工作。丰城县筱塘村的农会并召集全村民兵开会讨论，决定由民兵轮班看管在土地改革后尚未分配的果实。也有好多农村读报组因为向农民们宣传了人民政府的生产政策，解除了部分农民对生产的顾虑。村干部又从读报中学到了工作方法，解决了自己在工作中遇到的困难。大家都认识到读报可以“开脑筋”，“学办法”。在读报组进行读报的时候，很多农民都来旁听。每次读报时农民们对抗美援朝的新闻报道特别关心，尤其喜欢听关于中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜作战的通讯报道。读报组现已成为组织农民群众学习时事、政策的重要组织形式。
