    [Report from this newspaper] On the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, various organs, factories, and schools in Beijing will organize forums or evening gatherings to recall the Party's history of struggle and individual struggle stories. Each branch of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee, each bureau under the Beijing Municipal Government, and units such as department stores, municipal cooperatives, the People's Bank, and the post office will hold forums at the CCP branch level to recall the Party's struggles or to discuss personal understandings and feelings about the Party. Various departments of Peking University will also hold forums, inviting comrades who have done underground Party work at Peking University to talk about the underground Party work situation at Peking University in the past. Individual members of the Communist Youth League who wish to join the Communist Party will talk about their understanding and feelings about the Party. The general branch and branches of Renmin University will hold forums separately, inviting comrades who participated in the Party during various revolutionary periods of the Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation to talk about their contributions to the Party's cause since joining the Party, as well as their future directions and work plans. Labor models and combat heroes participating in the study, such as Li Fenglian, will also recall their past lives. The Beijing Machine General Factory, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, the Waterworks Company, and the People's Printing Factory are all preparing to hold various forums under the leadership of the CCP branches, mobilizing workers to recall the changes in life before and after the liberation of Beijing. The People's Printing Factory is also preparing to hold a forum for engineers and technicians, inviting them to talk about their feelings about the Communist Party and soliciting their opinions on the factory's Party work, in order to further strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses and improve production.
