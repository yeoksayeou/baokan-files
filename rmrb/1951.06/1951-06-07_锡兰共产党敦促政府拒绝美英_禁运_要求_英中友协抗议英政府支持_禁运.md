Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th -- The General Secretary of the Ceylon Communist Party, Wickremasinghe, and the Communist Member of Parliament of Ceylon, Keuneman, recently co-authored a letter to the Prime Minister of Ceylon, urging the government to reject the demand by US-British imperialism that Ceylon prohibit the export of rubber to our country. After denouncing the US for manipulating the United Nations to pass an illegal resolution imposing an embargo on our country, the letter stated: "If your government agrees to this demand from the United States and Britain, it would be tantamount to endorsing this resolution which violates the opinion of the majority of world opinion and the people of Ceylon." The letter also pointed out: "If your government agrees to sever trade with China on one of our main export commodities (referring to rubber), then our export market will be completely monopolized by American and British merchants, and we will increase our dependence on them. They can then arbitrarily reduce the price of rubber to any level. This could easily plunge the rubber industry and the lives of the millions of people who depend on rubber for a living into unfortunate circumstances." The letter also especially emphasized that if Ceylon exports rubber to China, it can exchange it for Chinese grain, thereby stabilizing the rubber industry, which is extremely important to Ceylon. The letter requested the Ceylon government to establish friendly trade relations with the New China.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th -- London Dispatch: The Britain-China Friendship Association convened a meeting in London on May 29th to protest the United Nations' decision to impose an "embargo" on China and the British government's support for this policy. The resolution passed at the meeting pointed out that this policy could expand the war of aggression and emphasized: "We demand that the government withdraw its support for this policy and, within the United Nations, call for an end to the Korean War and the withdrawal of all foreign troops."

Speakers at the meeting included Mr. Bratt, former expert on Asian affairs at the Foreign Office; Silverman, Member of Parliament for the Labour Party; Dr. Joseph Needham, a scientist; and White, General Secretary of the Association of Civil Servants.

     英中友协抗议英政府支持“禁运”
    【新华社新德里五日电】锡兰共产党总书记魏克马沁格和锡兰议会共产党议员克尼曼最近联名写信给锡兰总理，敦促政府拒绝美英帝国主义要锡兰禁止向我国输出橡胶的要求。信中在痛斥美国操纵联合国通过对我国实行禁运的非法决议以后说：“如果你的政府答应美国和英国现在这个要求，那就等于赞成这个违反世界大多数舆论和锡兰人民意见的决议。”信中并指出：“假若你的政府同意在我们主要的出口商品之一（按指橡胶）上断绝对中国的贸易，那末我们的出口市场将完全为美国与英国的商人们所垄断，我们就将增加对他们的依赖性，他们就可以随意把橡胶价格压低到任何程度。这样就很容易使橡胶工业以及依靠橡胶为生的千千万万人民的生活陷入不幸的情况。”信中也特别强调：锡兰如果对中国输出橡胶，就可以换得中国的粮食，而稳定对锡兰极其重要的橡胶工业。该信要求锡兰政府与新中国建立友好的贸易关系。
    【新华社布拉格六日电】伦敦航讯：英中友好协会五月二十九日在伦敦召集了一个会议，抗议联合国对中国实行“禁运”的决定和英国政府支持这个政策的态度。会议通过的决议在指出这个政策可能扩大侵略战争以后着重说：“我们要求政府撤销它对这种政策的支持，而且在联合国组织中要求结束朝鲜战争和撤退一切外国军队。
    在会议上发表演说的有前外交部亚洲问题专家布拉特，工党议员锡尔佛曼，科学家李约瑟博士和公务员协会总书记怀特等人。
