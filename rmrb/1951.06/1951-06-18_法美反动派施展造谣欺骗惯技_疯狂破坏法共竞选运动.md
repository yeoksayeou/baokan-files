　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Paris: The French National Assembly election is scheduled for today. On the eve of the election, the French reactionaries and their American masters are even more frantically engaging in deception, rumor-mongering, and all kinds of shameless sabotage activities, attempting to strike at the French Communist Party and swindle as many votes as possible for themselves.

　　As the election date approached, the French police intensified their persecution of the French Communist Party. The Paris Police Prefect, Bello, after ordering the arrest of the medical personnel of the Paris Metallurgical Workers' Clinic, actually said that "Communists are not French." At the same time, the election tactics played by the French reactionaries have reached an utterly shameless level. They included upright people who had no connection with them on their candidate lists, regardless of their opposition, in an attempt to anesthetize voters and swindle votes. The election agencies, manipulated by the reactionaries, deliberately registered many voters' names, ages, and addresses incorrectly in order to prevent these voters from legally participating in the voting.

　　In the last few days, the reactionary newspapers in Paris have used large headlines to carry out last-minute anti-communist clamoring. Fearing that many voters who are deeply disappointed with the government parties will abstain from voting in large numbers, thus causing the failure of the government parties, they shamelessly threatened people to vote. The "l'Aurore" even said on the 14th: "Every effort should be made... to make people understand that all abstentions on Sunday will be a criminal act."

　　American and British imperialism are seriously concerned about the French election and are doing their best to encourage the French reactionaries. The London Times anxiously stated: The entire imperialist group is waiting to see whether the election can produce a government in France that "firmly adheres to the Western bloc." The New York Herald Tribune openly published an editorial on the 13th, hoping that De Gaulle would come to power. It clamored that so-called "conscientious" French people and "patriotic" De Gaulle could change the current "unstable situation." It clamored that "the United States and all the Western bloc need France, need a France that continues to move along the path it has followed in recent years." General Bradley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had just returned from a tour of Europe, blatantly stated in Washington on the 16th that important decisions regarding Western "defense" are awaiting the results of the French election before they can be made.

　　However, the reactionary newspapers of the United States, Britain, and France could not conceal their anxiety about the future of the election. The New York Herald Tribune admitted that although the French government parties "are responsive to the United States, they lack unity or the support of the broad masses of the people." The Paris "L'Aurore" described the election as "an adventure, risking the danger of going to ruin." The London Times sadly believed that "the election will not fundamentally change the fatal division between workers and the bourgeoisie."

　　法美反动派施展造谣欺骗惯技        
    疯狂破坏法共竞选运动
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎讯：法国国民议会选举定于今日举行。在大选前夕，法国反动派及其美国主子更疯狂地进行欺骗、造谣和种种无耻的破坏活动，企图打击法国共产党，并为自己骗取尽可能多的选票。
    随着大选日期的临近，法国警察对法国共产党的迫害更变本加厉。巴黎警察厅厅长贝娄在下令逮捕巴黎冶金工人诊疗所医疗人员以后，竟说“共产党不是法国人”。同时法国反动派玩弄的竞选手腕已到了无耻绝伦的地步。他们把与自己毫无关系的正直人士不顾他们的反对而列入自己的候选人名单，企图借此麻醉选民，骗取选票。为反动派所操纵的选举机构，故意把许多选民的姓名、年龄、住址登记错，以此阻止这些选民不能合法地参加投票。
    最后几天中，巴黎各反动报纸纷纷以大字标题进行最后一秒钟的反共叫嚣，它们害怕许多对政府各党深为失望的选民会在选举中大批弃权，从而造成政府党的失败，因此无耻地要胁人们都去投票，十四日震旦报甚至说：“应不惜任何代价，……使人们了解在星期日所有的弃权都将是一个犯罪行为。”
    美英帝国主义严重关切法国这次选举，并极力为法国反动派打气。伦敦泰晤士报着急地表示：整个帝国主义集团正伫目以待，希望这次选举能在法国产生一个“坚定地依附于西方集团”的政府。纽约先驱论坛报在十三日公然发表社论希望戴高乐执政，它叫嚣所谓有“良知”的法国人，和有“爱国心”的戴高乐能够改变目前的“不稳定局面”。叫嚣“美国和所有的西方集团都需要法国，需要一个继续沿着近年来所遵循的道路前进的法国。”刚从欧洲巡视后返国的美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷，十六日在华盛顿露骨地表示：关于西方“防务”的重要决定，正在等待法国选举的结果才能作出。
    但是，美国、英国和法国的反动报纸都不能掩饰它们对选举前途的焦虑。纽约先驱论坛报承认法国各政府党虽然“对美国是有求必应，但是它们缺乏团结，或者缺乏广大人民的支持”。巴黎黎明报把选举说成“一个冒险，冒着走向毁灭的危险”。伦敦泰晤士报则悲哀地认为“选举将无法根本改变工人与资产阶级之间的致命的分化”。
