　　The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Makes a Decision:
    Practice the Three Great Patriotic Calls
    Donate a Plane Within Six Months
    [Reported by this newspaper] To ensure that the entire party is mobilized and that the masses it connects with take practical actions to respond to the three great calls of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Branch, the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has made a decision on practicing the patriotic pact, donating planes and artillery, and doing a good job in preferential treatment. Regarding the practice of the patriotic pact, the party has decided that for central and local organizations that have already established patriotic pacts, they should first review whether the content is practical and specific; otherwise, they should revise or add to them through the masses. Those that have not been established should be established as soon as possible. At the same time, it was also decided to mobilize party members to establish three-month or half-year personal guarantee plans to coordinate with collective patriotic pacts. Moreover, both patriotic pacts and personal guarantee plans must be checked in a timely manner. It is also necessary to encourage or help the masses to establish pacts and plans.
    Regarding the donation of planes and artillery, it was decided to mobilize party members to organize a concentrated donation drive and a regular donation drive. The party's central organization established the Resist America, Aid Korea Donation Committee (referred to as the RCK Donation General Branch), and local organizations established Resist America, Aid Korea Donation Committee branches or sub-branches (referred to as the local RCK Donation Branches or Sub-branches) to handle donation work. The goal of the concentrated donation drive is to raise 1.5 billion yuan to purchase a fighter plane, with a period of six months. The concentrated donation drive is based on the principle of donating within the party as much as possible. The regular donation drive involves fixed long-term donations based on the amount that can be saved from monthly wages or fixed income based on actual living conditions, until the complete victory of Resist America, Aid Korea. The decision emphasizes that party members should play a leading role among the masses, increase production, increase income, and enthusiastically donate to strengthen the power of Resist America, Aid Korea.
    Regarding doing a good job in preferential treatment, it was decided to assist the government, cooperate with various parties and groups to promptly comfort wounded, sick, and disabled soldiers and the families of martyrs and soldiers, and solve the employment problems of the families of martyrs and soldiers, as well as the educational problems of their children.
