Workers Support Farmers in Improving Agricultural Production
	Jinan Industrial Bureau No. 2 Factory Workers Produce Over 10,000 Waterwheels
	Shanxi Workers Mass Produce Agricultural Machinery and Insecticides

	In the year from March of last year to April of this year, Jinan Industrial Bureau No. 2 Factory produced 10,316 "Liberation-style" waterwheels for farmers, exceeding the original plan by 750 units. When the factory accepted this production task, the workers' skills were not yet proficient, and some tools and equipment needed adjustment and renovation, resulting in considerable difficulties. In order to ensure the successful completion of this task, the factory's Chinese Communist Party branch, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League conducted specific research and arrangements based on the workers' thinking and the specific circumstances of tools and equipment. Then, they separately educated the staff and workers on "helping farmers improve agricultural production." In discussions, the workers recognized the great significance of this task and unanimously expressed their willingness to help their farmer brothers produce waterwheels and improve agricultural production. They also made assurances and were determined to complete the task. Administrative leaders, in order to stimulate the workers' production enthusiasm, and in accordance with the principle of more work, more pay, tentatively formulated contract work systems and excess reward systems, which greatly encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm.
	In the production process, because the workers understood the significance of cooperating with agricultural production and construction tasks, their production enthusiasm remained high, and efficiency improved rapidly. Last November, it took 32 hours to make each waterwheel; this March, it only took 25 hours. As work became more proficient, quality also improved. In order to overcome difficulties such as incomplete equipment, the workers improved and created many tools. There were also achievements in saving materials. Because the workers overfulfilled the production task and saved and created wealth for the country, the administration has issued 45.18 million yuan in bonuses as rewards.
	Many factories in Shanxi Province are mass-producing agricultural machinery and insecticides to meet the needs of farmers in production. State-owned factories in Shanxi Province plan to produce 31,000 new-style agricultural tools, including 5-inch and 7-inch walking plows, waterwheels, corn threshers, chaff cutters, and sprayers, as well as 156 tons of copper sulfate and 45 tons of copper sulfate this year; and plan to trial-produce insecticides such as DDT and "666."
	According to last year's experience, these agricultural machines and insecticides are very helpful to agricultural production and are widely welcomed by farmers. Last year, the 5,000 waterwheels promoted by the Water Conservancy Bureau alone turned 80,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In Zhenhu Village, Tunliu County, only two mu of wheat developed a little smut disease in the 27 mu of wheat fields that were treated with pesticides; while in the wheat fields that were not treated with pesticides, 50% of the wheat suffered from smut disease.

　　工人支援农民提高农业生产
    济南工业局第二厂工人生产水车万余辆
    山西工人大量制造农业机械和杀虫药剂
    济南工业局第二厂，自去年三月至今年四月的一年多中，为农民生产了解放式水车一万零三百十六部，比原计划超过了七百五十部。该厂在接受这一生产任务时，工人的技术尚不熟练，又加若干工具设备需要调整、改造，因而有不少困难。为了保证这一任务的胜利完成，该厂中国共产党支部、行政、工会、青年团根据工人思想及工具设备等具体情况，作了具体研究布置。然后即分头向职工进行了“帮助农民提高农业生产”的教育。工人在讨论中，认识到这一任务的重大意义，一致表示要好好帮助农民兄弟生产水车，提高农业生产。并提出保证，决心完成这一任务。行政领导干部为了激发工人生产热情，并按多劳多得的原则，试订包工合同以及超额奖励等制度，大大鼓舞了工人们的生产热情。
    在生产过程中，由于工人们了解了配合农业生产建设任务的意义，生产情绪始终高涨，效率飞快提高。去年十一月每部水车需三十二小时造成，今年三月二十五小时即可造成。由于工作的逐渐熟练，质量也有提高。工人们为了克服设备不全等困难，改进与创造了不少工具。在节约用料方面也有成绩。由于工人们超额完成了生产任务，并为国家节省与创造了财富，行政方面已发了四千五百十八万元的奖金予以奖励。
    山西省许多工厂正大量制造农业机械和杀虫药剂，以满足农民生产上的需要。山西省营工厂计划在今年内生产五英寸和七英寸步犁、水车、玉米脱粒机、铡草机、喷雾器等新式农具三万一千部，王铜一百五十六吨，硫酸铜四十五吨；并拟试制滴滴涕、“六六六”等杀虫剂。
    根据去年的经验，这类农业机械和杀虫药剂，对农业生产很有帮助，受到农民的普遍欢迎。去年只水利局推销的五千辆水车，就使八万亩旱地变成水田。屯留县甄湖村去年用药剂拌种的二十七亩麦田中，只有二亩麦子发生一点黑穗病；而在没有用药剂拌种的麦田中，却有百分之五十的麦子害黑穗病。
