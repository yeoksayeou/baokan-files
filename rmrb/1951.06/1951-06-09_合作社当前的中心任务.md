The Current Central Task of Cooperatives
    Cheng Zihua
    Fully Satisfy the Needs of Members

The National Cooperative Workers' Representative Conference in July last year decided to conduct a comprehensive reorganization of grassroots cooperatives across the country. Through this reorganization, the idea of simply pursuing profits in the free market without regard for the commodity needs of members was basically corrected, and the concept of serving members was established, thereby strengthening the relationship between cooperatives and their members. By the end of last year, the number of grassroots cooperatives had grown to 46,000; membership had reached 30 million; and total funds amounted to approximately 147.43 billion yuan. There has also been significant development in business operations. For example, retail sales in the Northeast reached 3.2 trillion yuan, and total sales amounted to 1.6 trillion yuan. In North China, total retail sales reached over 3 trillion yuan, and total purchases amounted to over 1.9 trillion yuan. The scale of fulfilling state-entrusted tasks has also increased compared to the past. For example, the cooperatives accepted 300 billion yuan in fertilizer loans this year, and the result was an over-fulfillment of 450 billion yuan. They accepted the task of pre-purchasing 50 percent of cotton on behalf of the state, and currently, they are confident in completing over 30 percent, and they can strive to complete the entire task.

Through cooperatives, the scattered, disorganized, and unplanned transactions of the vast number of farmers are gradually converging into organized and planned trade that can be led and supervised by the state. Whether it is purchasing grain and cotton or promoting local products and industrial goods, supply and marketing cooperatives have become the most powerful assistants to the state-owned economy in rural areas. At the same time, as cooperatives are establishing democratic systems and gradually improving their business operations, they are gradually demonstrating to the masses that cooperatives are indeed different from private merchants, and cooperatives have gradually become economic organizations of the broad masses.

However, our work is not yet done well, and that is that we are not doing enough to fully satisfy the needs of our members. For example, in supplying members with daily necessities, Shanghai only meets 9 percent of the members' needs; Beijing only meets 32 percent; individual areas with good results only meet over 60 percent; and general grassroots cooperatives only meet 10 to 20 percent.

Although all levels of cooperatives have generally and actively been engaged in promoting the sale of members' products and supplying members with production materials, and there has been progress compared to the past, most members still report that products cannot be sold (generally resolved in North China), and cooperatives do not have a complete range of goods or sufficient quantities. Therefore, fully satisfying the needs of members, especially satisfying the demands of rural cooperative members to sell their local and specialty products, is the central task of cooperatives at present.

How can we fully satisfy the needs of members?

First, we must change the organizational form of current grassroots cooperatives.

(1) Rural Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

Currently, most rural grassroots cooperatives are established according to administrative villages or even natural villages. They have few members, little capital, and little business. Under the circumstances of rural economic recovery and development, they can no longer meet the needs of members. At the same time, because there are many cadres and high expenses, the operations of many grassroots cooperatives are loss-making, which is of course not sustainable.

In rural areas, some grassroots cooperatives are not established according to administrative villages, but according to market towns. Such cooperatives have more members, more capital, and more business, and are better able to meet the needs of members. At the same time, because there are fewer cadres and lower expenses, there is no phenomenon of loss-making operations.

Market towns are primary markets and primary exchange centers in rural areas. Combining the grassroots organizations of cooperatives with primary exchange centers will inevitably greatly enhance the role of cooperatives.

In areas with many market towns, it is not necessary to establish a cooperative in every market town; in areas with few market towns, a large village can be selected as the center to establish a cooperative.

When establishing cooperatives in market towns, the Communist Party branches and the main cadres of the government in the villages must be consciously elected to the board of directors and supervisors to participate in the leadership of the cooperative. It is more difficult to convene members' meetings in such cooperatives. The role of members' representative meetings and group meetings should be strengthened to promote the democracy of grassroots cooperatives.

(2) Urban Consumer Cooperatives

Currently, urban consumer cooperatives are generally established according to factories, schools, and government agencies. Because many factories and government agencies lack centralized dormitories, workers and staff are dispersed, and it is inconvenient for members to go to the cooperative to buy things. Also, because the units are small and the grassroots cooperatives are small, they cannot meet the needs of members.

Urban consumer cooperatives only have the business of supplying members with daily necessities and do not have the business of supplying production materials or selling products. Because there are many factories producing means of production and living in cities, there are no or very few regional price differences. Operating profits are generally smaller than in rural areas. Therefore, the organizational form of urban grassroots cooperatives must be larger than that of rural grassroots cooperatives. Urban grassroots cooperatives can be organized in three forms: 1. Large factories, universities, and government agencies with centralized dormitories can establish cooperatives according to production and administrative units; 2. Workers' consumer cooperatives can be organized in areas where workers live in a concentrated manner; 3. Cooperatives can be established based on administrative districts in the city. Establishing cooperatives in these three forms can merge many small units into large grassroots cooperatives. This is not only convenient for operation, but also facilitates members. It not only maintains the direct leadership of the municipal general cooperative, but also facilitates the leadership of the Party committee, thus strengthening the leadership of grassroots cooperatives, managing them rationally, and meeting the needs of members. For example, the Beijing Municipal General Cooperative currently leads 383 grassroots cooperatives. After changing the organizational form, the number of supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs will be 35, the number of consumer cooperatives in factories, government agencies, and schools will be 35 (and may be reduced), the number of workers' consumer cooperatives will be 2, and the number of district mixed consumer cooperatives will be 9, for a total of 81. This is much more reasonable than leading 383 grassroots cooperatives, or even having an intermediate level.

After such a change, grassroots cooperatives can establish various departments and specialized business units according to the needs of business development. This not only makes the operation of cooperatives rational, but also helps to improve all the work of cooperatives.

Second, overcome the tendency of all levels of united cooperatives to pursue high profits

Currently, the first demand of rural members and farmers is to sell local products. The second is to supply daily necessities and production materials. Some products have long "legs" (i.e., possible sales channels), while others have short "legs." Long-legged products need to be bought and sold over long distances, while short-legged products need to be bought and sold over short distances. Long-legged products have large regional price differences, while short-legged products have small regional price differences. In order to pursue high profits, many cooperatives are willing to buy and sell over long distances, but are unwilling to buy and sell over short distances. They compete for large profits, but are unwilling to make small profits, and do not make any profit at all. Production areas want to sell to sales areas, and sales areas want to purchase from production areas. As a result, short-legged products are ignored or rarely cared for, and they pile up and cannot be sold. Everyone competes for long-legged products, but they cannot make much. As a result, higher-level cooperatives cannot serve lower-level cooperatives well, and grassroots cooperatives cannot fully meet the needs of members. The current disorganized and unplanned chaos is a huge waste of manpower and capital for cooperatives.

The view of all levels of united cooperatives in pursuing high profits shows a lack of a complete mass perspective of serving members. While lower-level cooperatives and members are crying out that products cannot be sold, higher-level cooperatives do not first concentrate their efforts to promote the sale of members' products, but rather look at the size of the profits first. While members are crying out that the cooperatives do not have a complete range of goods and the quantity is too small, higher-level cooperatives do not actively think of ways to increase the variety and quantity of goods. When members submit orders, the higher-level cooperatives do not meet them and do not think that they have failed to fulfill the responsibility of being a service provider. If this situation is not changed, cooperatives will not be successful.

This high-profit view is also manifested in neglecting the economic accounting of cooperatives. Many cooperative cadres do not understand that the reason why cooperatives can provide members with high-quality and low-priced goods and purchase members' products at reasonable prices, while also being able to obtain reasonable profits, is because of their own economic accounting. The joint operation method of cooperatives at all levels that is currently being promoted in various places has achieved great results in promoting the sale of local products, but the view of pursuing high profits has not been resolutely corrected, but rather a compromise method has been adopted. As a result, economic accounting still cannot be done well.

In order to change this situation, it is entirely necessary to appropriately stipulate the scope of business for material exchanges between cooperatives at all levels, according to the distance of product sales channels. This is: 1. Organize the business of lower-level cooperatives; 2. Engage in business with neighboring cooperatives; 3. Business that cannot be resolved by the above two can be organized through higher-level cooperatives. At the same time, according to the principle of cooperatives operating business in a planned and organized manner, it should be through a contract system. The contract system is a concentrated expression of planning, organization, and discipline. Adhering to the contract system can enable the business and all work of cooperatives to continue to advance.

Third, the policy of "no transactions with non-members" should be modified

The policy of "no transactions with non-members" has been successful in the year since it was proposed and implemented. In order to oppose the past purely profit-seeking view of some cooperatives and the resulting complete detachment from members and pursuit of the market, it was proposed to reverse the business ideology of cooperatives pursuing free market profits to the ideology of "higher-level cooperatives serving lower-level cooperatives, and grassroots cooperatives serving members," so that cooperatives embarked on the right track, but practice has also proven that this statement is not complete.

Many of the daily necessities and production materials needed by members are not available or insufficient from cooperatives and state-owned economic organizations, and must be purchased from private enterprises; the products that members need to sell cannot all be purchased by cooperatives and state-owned economic organizations, and must be sold to private enterprises. Since we only buy and sell goods from the cooperative system and state-owned economy, the source of goods is reduced, and the sales channels for products are narrowed, so it is of course impossible to fully meet the supply and marketing requirements of members. In order to meet their own needs, members have to sell their products and buy the goods they need from private merchants, and therefore cannot avoid being exploited by private merchants in the middle. Therefore, this statement causes great losses to members.

Private enterprises in our country account for a large proportion within the customs. In a new democratic society, it is an important source of goods for cooperatives to purchase, and also a large customer for cooperatives to sell products. We must open the door to them, not close the door to them. But this is only for the purpose of purchasing goods needed by members and selling products of members, not for the purpose of pursuing profits in the free market. This business ideology of conducting business based on the needs of members cannot be said to be a capitalist business ideology.

Fourth, focus on economic crop areas

Developing economic crops is necessary for developing light industries of daily necessities. Therefore, the focus of this year's agricultural production increase is on this aspect, and the focus of bank agricultural loans and state-owned trade purchases is also on this aspect. If cooperatives also focus their work on this aspect, they can be closely integrated with the state-owned economy.

Currently, cooperatives lack cadres and have very little capital. It is impossible to take care of all kinds of businesses in a comprehensive manner. They must use their cadres and capital in a focused manner in order to play a greater role. Only by arranging their work according to the state's key economic construction plan can they receive more assistance from the state-owned economy (such as using state funds), which is conducive to the rapid development of cooperatives. According to this policy, cooperatives should arrange their organizational work, supply and marketing business, production and processing, as well as transportation, warehouses, and freight yards in a planned and organized manner. Currently, many cooperatives are unable to play a greater role because they have not clearly grasped this key work policy, and their forces are scattered.

Focusing on economic crop areas does not mean not focusing on other areas. Grasping the key is only to effectively drive and promote the work in other areas, in order to gradually achieve comprehensive control.

By implementing the above-mentioned points, we can continuously improve the existing cooperatives and gradually achieve the goal of fully satisfying the needs of members.

Welcome the Great Development of Cooperatives

The rectification of cooperative work in the old areas can be fully completed by June this year. In addition, merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives will lay a good foundation for the great development of cooperatives.

In the new areas with a population of 130 million, land reform has been completed, and the remaining areas (except for ethnic minority areas) may also complete land reform by the end of this year. This means that nearly 300 million people urgently demand to organize cooperatives. Cooperatives must welcome this great task and must make the greatest efforts to meet this demand from farmers in the new areas.

Cadres in the cooperative system do not have a clear and sensitive understanding of this new situation and task. They are hesitant and do not dare to boldly develop cooperatives in the new areas. The reason is that they do not have a clear understanding of the boundary between capitalist business ideology and cooperative business ideology. In the past, cooperatives simply pursued market profits, which was a capitalist ideology. Now, developing cooperatives in the new areas under the policy of promoting the sale of members' products and supplying members' needs, as long as they do not engage in trade that has nothing to do with promoting the sale of members' local products and supplying members' necessities, even if the profit-sharing ratio is a little higher at the beginning, it will not change the cooperative's business direction, and therefore will be supported by members. Of course, it will not fail like in the past. However, cooperatives that develop so rapidly will not be completely standardized. In order to further improve, it is necessary to conduct a reorganization of the cooperatives in a timely manner when the great development reaches a certain stage.

　　合作社当前的中心任务
    程子华
    充分满足社员的需要
    去年七月全国合作社工作者代表会议，曾决定对全国基层合作社作一次全面的整理。经过这次整理，基本上纠正了合作社不顾社员的商品需要、单纯地去追逐自由市场的单纯盈利思想，树立起为社员服务的观点，因而密切了合作社与社员的关系。到去年年终，基层社发展到四万六千个；社员发展到三千万人；各种资金合计约为一四、七四三亿元。在业务上也有了很大的发展，如东北零售额达到三万二千亿元，推销总额达到一万六千亿元。华北零售总额达到三万余亿元，收购总额达到一万九千余亿元。在完成国家的委托业务上，比过去规模也大了，如今年接受三千亿元肥料贷款，结果是超额完成了四千五百亿元；接受国家委托预购棉花百分之五十的任务，目前已有把握完成百分之三十多，可以争取全部完成。
    通过合作社，使广大农民的零星、散漫、无组织、无计划的交易，逐渐汇合成为国家可以领导监督的、有组织有计划的贸易。无论收购粮食、棉花或推销土产及工业品，供销合作社都成为国营经济在农村中最有力的助手。同时由于合作社正在建立民主制度，正在逐渐改进自己的业务，在群众面前逐渐显示出合作社与私商确实有所不同，合作社已逐渐成为广大群众的经济组织。
    但是我们的工作，还不是作得很好，这就是在充分满足社员的需要上，还很不够。如在供应社员生活品上，上海只达到社员需要量的百分之九；北京只达到百分之三十二；个别成绩好的地区也只达到百分之六十多；一般基层社只达到百分之十到二十。
    在推销社员产品，供应社员生产资料上，虽然各级社均已普遍地积极地在进行，比较过去已有进步，但一般社员仍然反映：产品销不出（华北大体已解决），合作社货样不全，数量少。因此，充分满足社员需要，特别是满足农村合作社员推销其土产与特产品的要求，是合作社当前的中心任务。
    如何才能充分满足社员需要呢？
            第一、必须把现在基层社的组织形式加以改变。
            （一）农村供销社
    现在一般农村基层社是按行政村甚或是自然村建立的。社员少，资金少，业务少。在农村经济恢复和发展的情况下，已不能满足社员需要。同时因为干部多，开支大，许多基层社的经营是亏本的，这当然不可能持久的。
    在农村，已有一些基层社不是按行政村建立，而是按集镇建立的。这样的社，社员多，资金多，业务多，满足社员的需要就比较多。同时因为干部少，开支少，没有亏本经营的现象。
    集镇是农村中的初级市场，初级的交换中心，把合作社的基层组织与初级的交换中心结合起来，必然会极大地发挥合作社的作用。
    集镇多的，不必每一集镇建社；集镇少的，可选择大村为中心建社。
    集镇建社，须有意识地选举村的中共支部和政府的主要干部到理监事会，以便参加对合作社的领导。这样的社的社员大会比较难于召开。应加强社员代表大会和小组会的作用，以便发扬基层社的民主。
            （二）城市消费社
    现在城市消费社一般是按工厂、学校、机关建立的，因为许多工厂、机关缺乏集中的宿舍，工人、职员驻地分散，社员到合作社买东西是不方便的。又因单位小，基层社小，不能满足社员的需要。
    城市消费社只有供应社员生活资料的业务，没有供应生产资料和推销产品的业务。因为生产生活资料的工厂多在城市，因而没有或很少有地区差价。经营的利润一般比农村小。因此城市基层社较之农村基层社的组织形式须要更大些。城市基层社可用三种形式组织之：１、大工厂、大学校、大机关有集中的宿舍的，按生产和行政单位建社；２、工人居住集中的地区，则组织工人消费社；３、按市内行政区为单位建社。按照这三种形式建社，可以把许多小单位合并为大的基层社。既便于经营，又便利社员。既保持了市总社直接领导，又便于党委领导，因而能加强对基层社的领导，合理地经营，满足社员的需要。例如北京市总社现在领导三八三个基层社，改变组织形式后，郊区供销社为三十五个，工厂、机关、学校消费社为三十五个（还可能减少），工人消费社二个，区混合消费社九个，共为八十一个，这就比领导三八三个基层社，或者中间设一级，要合理的多。
    这样改变以后，基层社可以根据业务发展的需要，设立各种不同的部门和专业的企业单位。不但合作社的经营合理，更有利于把合作社的一切工作提高。
            第二、克服各级联合社追逐高额利润的偏向
    目前农村社员和农民的第一个要求，是推销土产品。其次是供应生活资料和生产资料。产品的腿（即可能的销路）有长有短。腿长的需远地购销，腿短的需近地购销。腿长的地区差价大，腿短的地区差价小。为了追逐高额利润，许多社愿意远地购销，不愿意近地购销。利大的争着作，利小的不愿作，无利的不作。产地要到销地推销，销地要到产地采购。结果是腿短的产品无人过问或很少人过问，堆积着销不了；腿长的产品大家争着作，反倒作不了多少。结果是上级社不能很好地为下级社服务，基层社不能充分地满足社员的需要。目前这种无组织无计划的乱跑，对合作社的人力和资金是一个极大的浪费。
    各级联合社这种追逐高额利润的观点，表现了缺乏完整的为社员服务的群众观点。下级社和社员在大叫产品推销不出，上级社却不首先集中大力去推销社员的产品，而是首先看利润大小。社员在大叫合作社的货样不全、数量太少，而上级社并不积极想办法增加商品的种类和数量。社员的订货单提出了，上级社没有满足，并不认为是没有负起勤务员的责任。这种情形如不改变，合作社是不会办好的。
    这种高额盈利的观点，在另一方面表现为忽视合作社的经济核算。许多合作干部不了解合作社所以能够供给社员以物美价廉的商品，以合理价格收购社员的产品，而又能够取得合理的利润，就是靠自己的经济核算。各地合作社现在推行的各级社联营办法，在推销土产方面收到了大的效果，但对追逐高额利润的观点并未坚决纠正，而是采取了迁就的办法。结果仍不能搞好经济核算。
    为了改变这种情况，按照产品销路的远近，把各级合作社组织物资交流的业务范围适当地加以规定，是完全需要的。这就是：１、组织下级社的业务；２、同邻区社经营业务；３、以上两者不能解决的业务，通过上级社组织之。同时按照合作社有计划有组织地经营业务的原则，应当是通过合同制。合同制是计划性、组织性、纪律性的集中表现。坚持合同制，就能使合作社的业务和一切工作不断地前进。
            第三、“不作非社员交易”的方针，应有所修改
    “不作非社员交易”的方针提出和贯彻后，一年来是有成绩的。为了反对过去某些合作社的单纯营利观点并随之而来的完全脱离社员而追逐市场的偏向，曾提出把合作社追逐自由市场利润的经营思想，扭转为“上级社为下级社服务，基层社为社员服务”的思想，使合作社走上了正轨，但实践中又证明，这种提法是不完全的。
    社员需要的生活资料和生产资料，很多为合作社和国营经济机关所没有，或不足，必须要向私营企业购买；社员需要推销的产品，合作社和国营经济机关不可能全部收买，须要向私营企业推销。我们既然只向合作社系统和国营经济进销货物，货物的来源就减少了，产品的销路就狭窄了，当然就不可能充分满足社员的供销要求。社员为满足自己的需要，只好向私商推销自己的产品和购买自己需要的商品，因而免不了要受私商的中间剥削。因此这种提法给予社员的损失极大。
    我国私营企业在关内所占比重很大。在新民主主义社会中，它是合作社购买商品的重要来源，也是合作社推销产品的很大顾主。我们必须向他们开门，不能向他们关门。但这只是为了购买社员需要的商品，推销社员的产品，不是为了追逐自由市场的利润。这种根据社员需要来进行业务的经营思想，不能说是资本主义的经营思想。
            第四、把工作重点放在经济作物地区
    发展经济作物是发展日用必需品轻工业所必需，因此，今年农业增产的重点放在这方面，银行农贷和国营贸易收购的重点也放在这方面。如果合作社把自己的工作重点也放在这方面，就可与国营经济密切地联成一体。
    目前合作社的干部很缺，资金很少，不可能周全地照顾到各种业务，必须有重点地使用自己的干部和资金，才能发挥大的作用。也只有根据国家这种重点的经济建设计划，布置自己的工作，才能更多的得到国营经济的扶助（如运用国家资金），有利于合作社的迅速发展。根据这一方针，合作社应当把自己的组织工作、供销业务、生产加工、以及运输、仓库、货栈等，有计划有组织地加以安排。目前许多合作社由于没有明确地抓住这一重点工作方针，因而力量分散，不能发挥大的作用。
    把工作重点放在经济作物地区，并不是不要其他地区。掌握重点，只是为了有力地带动和推动其他地区的工作，以便逐步地达到全面掌握。
    把以上提出的这些加以贯彻，就能不断地提高现有合作社，逐步地达到充分满足社员的需要。
            迎接合作社的大发展
    老区的整顿合作社工作，到今年六月可以全部结束，再加上把小社合并为大社，就给合作社大发展打下了良好的基础。
    新区一亿三千万人口地区，已完成了土地改革，其余地区（除少数民族区）在今年年底也可能完成土地改革。这就是说，有近三亿的人口迫切地要求组织合作社。合作社必须迎接这一伟大任务，必须以最大努力满足新区农民这一要求。
    合作社系统的干部，对这一新的形势和任务的认识，是不明确和不敏锐的。对于在新区发展合作社，表现了束手束脚，不敢大胆发展。其原因，是对资本主义的经营思想和合作社的经营思想的分界没有明确的认识。过去合作社单纯地追逐市场利润，是资本主义思想。现在新区在推销社员产品，供应社员需要的方针下发展合作社，只要不去经营那些与推销社员土产和供给社员必需品毫无关系的贸易，起初一个时期，即使分红比例多一点，也不会改变合作社的经营路线，因而会得到社员的拥护。当然就不会像过去那样遭到失败。但是，这样迅速发展起来的合作社，是不会完全正规的。为了进一步提高，就要在大发展达到一定阶段时适时地进行一次整社工作。
