"Practical Pediatrics," edited by Zhu Futang and published by the Chinese Medical Association (revised and reprinted in 1950), in Chapter VII, "Preventive Measures for Children's Happiness," advocates that "birth control is a crucial preventive measure, and in China's current situation, it is indeed necessary to enthusiastically promote it." Fan Baoqi, a reader from Shijiazhuang, believes that this argument is extremely erroneous. Comrade Fan Baoqi pointed out in his letter, "This is a matter of ideology and also a matter of social system. Only in imperialist or capitalist countries do they use the reactionary Malthusian population theory to advocate birth control. As for socialist countries and new democratic countries, they all encourage childbirth. Today, to still inherit this bourgeois reactionary thought and promote it, cannot be regarded as a serious mistake."

The Chinese Medical Association has accepted Comrade Fan Baoqi's criticism and decided to make revisions.

### 《实用儿科学》不应提倡节制生育

　　《实用儿科学》不应提倡节制生育
    诸福棠主编、中华医学会发行的《实用儿科学》（一九五○年修正重印版）第七章《儿童幸福之预防设施》主张“节制生育系预防要着，在我国现状之下，实有热诚提倡之必要”。石家庄读者范保齐认为这种论点极端谬误。范保齐同志来信指出“这是一个思想问题，也是一个社会制度问题。只有在帝国主义或资本主义国家才利用反动的马尔萨斯人口论去提倡节制生育，至于社会主义国家和新民主主义国家都是奖励生育的。在今天，还因袭这种资产阶级的反动思想并且替它作宣传，不能不认为是一个严重的错误。”
    中华医学会接受了范保齐同志的批评，决定进行修改。
