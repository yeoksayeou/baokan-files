Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 6th: The meeting of the four deputy foreign ministers to draft the agenda for the four foreign ministers' meeting continues.

At the meetings on May 28th and 29th, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France continued to stubbornly oppose including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the issue of American military bases on the agenda, thus causing the meeting to be delayed and unable to reach an agreement on the agenda for the foreign ministers' meeting.

In his speech at the meeting, Soviet representative Gromyko repeatedly cited facts to convincingly prove that the conclusion of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the establishment of American military bases targeting the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are the main reasons for the current tense international situation in Europe and the worsening relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France. Gromyko said: We believe that unless we unanimously agree on the need to discuss this issue, it is meaningless to hold a meeting of foreign ministers. The refusal of the three Western governments to discuss this issue is clearly intended to use our meeting as a smokescreen, behind which they are taking various measures to expand their armaments, build American military bases, and restore German militarism in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In this way, the three governments have revealed that their participation in the foreign ministers' meeting is to deceive public opinion. The Soviet Union is opposed to deceiving the people.

At the meeting on May 31st, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France submitted to the Soviet representative similar notes from the three governments to the Soviet government. The three-nation note stated that the meeting of deputy foreign ministers had not reached an agreement on a mutually acceptable agenda, and suggested that a meeting of the four foreign ministers be held in Washington on July 23, based on one of the three draft agendas proposed by the three delegations on May 2nd. These three draft agendas did not include the issues of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and American military bases.

At the request of the three representatives, the meeting of deputy foreign ministers adjourned for three days and resumed on June 4th. At the meeting on the 4th, Soviet representative Gromyko submitted the Soviet government's reply to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to the three representatives. The Soviet government's reply stated that the Soviet government has always believed that it is necessary and beneficial to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers as soon as possible to discuss the most important issues concerning the elimination of tensions in Europe and the strengthening of peace. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is inappropriate to interrupt the work of the Paris meeting of deputy foreign ministers. Once the Paris meeting of deputy foreign ministers affirmatively resolves the issue of including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the issue of American military bases as unresolved proposals on the agenda, the Soviet government will be prepared to immediately send representatives to attend the four foreign ministers' meeting in Washington.

　　四国外长助理会议休会三天
    苏复文美、英、法政府 
    认为应及早召开外长会议讨论关于消除欧洲紧张局势等重要问题
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎消息：为四国外长会议草拟议程的四国外长助理会议继续举行。
    在五月二十八、二十九日会议上，美、英、法三国代表继续死硬地反对把北大西洋公约及美国军事基地问题列入议程，因而使得会议拖延时日，不能就外长会议议程获致协议。
    苏联代表葛罗米柯在会上发言中一再列举事实，令人信服地证明，侵略性的北大西洋公约的缔结以及针对着苏联和人民民主国家的美国军事基地的建立，是目前欧洲国际局势紧张和苏联与美、英、法三国关系日趋恶化的主要原因。葛罗米柯说：我们认为，除非我们一致同意有必要讨论这个问题，不然召开外长会议就没有意义。西方三国政府拒绝讨论这个问题，显然是有意利用我们的会议作为烟幕，在这个烟幕的后面，它们正根据北大西洋公约采取种种措施进行扩充军备运动，建筑美国军事基地，恢复德国军国主义。这样，三国政府就暴露出它们之所以参加外长会议，是为了欺骗舆论。而苏联是反对欺骗人民的。
    美、英、法三国代表在五月三十一日会议上，将三国政府致苏联政府的类似的照会递交苏联代表。三国照会中说外长助理会议没有就可以互相接受的议程获致协议，建议以三国代表团在五月二日所提出的三种议程草案中的一种为基础，于七月二十三日在华盛顿召开四国外长会议。这三种议程草案都是并不包括北大西洋公约及美国军事基地问题在内的。
    在三国代表的请求下，外长助理会议休会三日，至六月四日复会。苏联代表葛罗米柯在四日会议上将苏联政府致美、英、法三国政府的复文递交三国代表。苏联政府的复文中说，苏联政府一向认为，及早召开四国外长会议，以讨论关于消除欧洲紧张局势和加强和平的最重要问题，是必要而且有益的。同时，苏联政府认为，中断巴黎外长助理会议的工作是不适宜的。一俟巴黎外长助理会议肯定地解决了把关于北大西洋公约和美国军事基地问题作为未获协议的议案列入议程的问题以后，苏联政府便准备立即派遣代表出席华盛顿的四国外长会议。
