Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held a banquet in Berlin on the 6th to entertain the Chinese People's Delegation which is here to participate in the German-Chinese Friendship Month. Those present included Chairman Pieck of the Socialist Unity Party, General Secretary Ulbricht, and other members of the Political Bureau, the head of the Chinese delegation, Shen Junru, and all members of the delegation, and the head of the Chinese diplomatic mission, Ambassador Ji Pengfei.

Chairman Pieck spoke at the banquet. He said: "The liberated Chinese people are a good example for the people of all countries who are still enslaved by American and British imperialism. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting the barbaric American interventionist forces in Korea, which is to defend the peace and security of the whole world. The German people, like all peace-loving people, want to express their gratitude to you."

Head of Delegation Shen Junru paid tribute to Chairman Pieck and congratulated the German people on their electoral victory. He said: "We are very happy to come to Germany at this important time. We are willing to contribute all our strength to the German-Chinese Friendship Month, because we firmly believe that the friendly cooperation between our two peoples, fighting side by side in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, is a great force for defending peace."

During the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted to the friendship between the Chinese and German peoples, and to Chairman Mao Zedong, President Pieck, and Marshal Stalin.

During the banquet, Pieck, Ulbricht, Shen Junru and Xia Yan jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong to express their respect.

　　中德两国人民友好合作、保卫和平
    德统一社会党中央欢宴我代表团
    皮克主席与沈钧儒等联名电毛主席致敬
    【新华社柏林八日电】德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局六日在柏林设宴招待来此参加德中友好月的中国人民代表团。出席的有统一社会党主席皮克，总书记乌布利希和政治局的其他各委员，中国代表团团长沈钧儒和全体团员，中国外交使团大使衔团长姬鹏飞。
    皮克主席在席间讲话。他说：“解放了的中国人民是目前仍处在美英帝国主义奴役下的各国人民的好榜样。英勇的中国人民志愿军在朝鲜与野蛮的美国干涉军作战，也就是保卫全世界的和平与安全。德国人民和所有爱好和平的人民一样，要向你们表示感谢。”
    沈钧儒团长向皮克主席致敬，并祝贺德国人民投票的胜利。他说：“我们在这个重要的时候来到德国，至感高兴。我们愿为德中友好月而贡献我们的一切力量，因为我们深信，在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中并肩战斗的我们两国人民的友好合作，乃是一支保卫和平的伟大力量。”
    席间，宾主一再为中德人民的友谊，为毛泽东主席、皮克总统与斯大林大元帅而干杯。
    席间，皮克，乌布利希，沈钧儒和夏衍联名致电毛泽东主席表示敬意。
