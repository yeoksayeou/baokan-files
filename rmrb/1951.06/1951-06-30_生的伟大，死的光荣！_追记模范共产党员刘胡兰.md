Living Greatly, Dying Gloriously!
    ——In Memory of Model Communist Party Member Liu Hulan

    Comrade Liu Hulan was martyred on January 12, 1947, more than four years ago. This model member of the Chinese Communist Party and outstanding daughter of the Chinese nation lives forever in the hearts of the Chinese people. After Comrade Liu Hulan's sacrifice, many troops launched a "avenge Liu Hulan" campaign. Chairman Mao wrote an elegy for Comrade Liu Hulan, saying: "Living greatly, dying gloriously."

    Comrade Liu Hulan was from Yunzhou West Village, Wenshui County, Shanxi Province. Wenshui is located on the fertile central Shanxi plain and is rich in products, but because the Yan Xishan bandit gang had been plundering it for a long time, the farmers lived a very poor life. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders occupied Wenshui County and several villages. The Yan Xishan bandit gang collapsed without a fight. Soon, the local people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, launched a vigorous anti-Japanese struggle. When Liu Hulan was about ten years old, she met Comrade Liu Fang, an enemy work cadre of the Eighth Sub-district of the Luliang Military Region, at the home of her neighbor, Jin Xian. At that time, Liu Hulan was too young to understand what Liu Fang and others were doing. Later, as Liu Hulan grew older and understood more things, she began to recognize the heroic cause that Liu Fang and the others were engaged in. Later, Liu Hulan also met Han Rufan, secretary of the Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Wenshui County, and female cadre Lü Xuemei at Jin Xian's house. She was directly influenced by the Party and initially determined the path she should take.

    In August 1945, the Japanese invaders surrendered. The People's Liberation Army liberated Wenshui County on September 1. However, after only a few days, the Yan Xishan bandit army, in conjunction with the Japanese and puppet troops, launched a large-scale offensive against the people of Shanxi. The People's Liberation Army adhered to the policy of annihilating the enemy's effective strength and temporarily withdrew from Wenshui City, while continuing to fight the enemy in the vast rural areas of Wenshui. At this time, various tasks in the liberated areas had greatly developed, and there was an urgent need for cadres. The Fifth District of Wenshui decided that Comrade Lü Xuemei would be responsible for training a group of female cadres, and the address of the training class was in Guanjia Fort, eight miles northwest of Yunzhou West Village. Liu Hulan decided to participate in the study. Knowing that her grandmother would definitely stop her, she secretly ran to the training class to receive training.

    When the grandmother heard the news that Liu Hulan was studying in Guanjia Fort, she went to look for her early the next morning, but was unable to call her back.

    Forty days later, Liu Hulan graduated and returned home to serve as the secretary of the Women's Salvation Association in Yunzhou West Village.

    Liu Hulan served the people wholeheartedly, worked hard, and made rapid progress. Shi Shifang, the organization member of the Wenshui Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, introduced her to the Chinese Communist Party. This was a fundamental turning point in Liu Hulan's life history.

    From mid-May 1946, the Yan Xishan bandit army dispatched more than 5,800 people to launch a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas of Wenshui and Jiaocheng. By the end of June, the bandit army had gradually increased its troops to more than 15,000 people. The soldiers and civilians in the Wenshui liberated area launched a heroic war of self-defense. Under the leadership of Liu Hulan and other cadres, the women of Yunzhou West Village actively supported the front line and collected many gifts to comfort the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front line.

    In December 1946, the People's Liberation Army launched the Jinxi Campaign. Several units that had persisted in fighting in the Wenshui area in the past transferred to Jinxi to fight. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Yan Xishan bandit gang attacked from north to south with several divisions, vainly attempting to destroy the people's power, the Chinese Communist Party organization, and the people's self-defense armed forces in the villages on the plains.

    The enemy did not achieve its goal. Before the enemy reached Yunzhou West Village, most of the Party members, cadres, and activists had been safely transferred. However, Liu Hulan was trapped in the village by the enemy and did not have time to transfer. Liu Hulan decided to transfer to the mountains that night. However, just as dawn broke, Yunzhou West Village was surrounded by the Yan bandit army and the "People's Defense Army." The enemy forced all the men, women, and children in the village to gather at the large temple in the south of the village. Only one person was allowed to stay at home to watch the door, and those who left two people would be dealt with as being in communication with "bandits"!

    The villagers were driven by the enemy to the open space near the temple in the south of the village. Liu Hulan squeezed into the crowd.

    The people at the meeting place waited angrily and nervously. A "People's Defense Army" squeezed into the crowd, pulled Liu Hulan aside, and mumbled for a while. Liu Hulan returned to her mother and told her, "They want me to 'confess' today! They said that if I 'confess,' nothing will happen, but if I don't 'confess,' they will take my life..." Now, her face was resolute and serious, and she was prepared to accept the severe test that was about to come. She handed the ring on her hand and the handkerchief in her pocket to her mother.

    The enemy indeed arrested Liu Hulan. Many enemies surrounded her and took her to the temple, where an officer questioned her. The enemy asked, "Are you called Hulanzi?" Liu Hulan said, "I am Liu Hulan." The enemy asked, "What have you been doing in the village?" Liu Hulan said, "I served as the secretary of the Women's Salvation Association." The enemy asked, "Someone has already confessed that you are a Communist Party member." Liu Hulan said, "I am a Communist Party member!" The enemy asked, "Who else in your village is a Communist Party member?" Liu Hulan said, "I am the only Communist Party member." The enemy asked, "Who do you know in the Eighth Route Army?" Liu Hulan said, "I don't know anyone!" The enemy was so angry that he slammed the table and shouted, "You are only fifteen years old, but you are so stubborn. Aren't you afraid of death?" Liu Hulan said calmly, "Dying is right. I don't know anything."

    The enemy asked for a long time without any results. The enemy knew that it was very difficult to get Liu Hulan to confess any useful information to them. So they decided to first let Liu Hulan "guarantee that she would never work for the Eighth Route Army again." As soon as the enemy said this, Liu Hulan immediately said, "I can't guarantee that!"

    The enemy said again, "If you come with me today, I can spare your life!"

    Liu Hulan only answered two words: "No way!"

    Finally, the enemy decided to kill Liu Hulan. Liu Hulan walked to the entrance of the temple and was called back by the Yan bandit officer. The enemy prepared to make one last attempt to deceive her. However, Liu Hulan said, "Is it still about the same thing? Then, there's no need to talk about it." Liu Hulan tossed her head and walked out.

    When the enemy announced the list of seven people to be executed to the masses, the masses immediately stirred up. The enemy panicked and hurriedly set up machine guns, "preparing to fire" at the masses.

    The massacre began. The enemy first beheaded Shi Sanhuai, Shi Sijia, Liu Laosan, Zhang Niancheng, Shi Yangbing, and Chen Zhuzhe, who was over seventy years old. Some of these people were family members of cadres, and some had only done a little bit of revolutionary work, but now they had all died heroically.

    Finally, it was Liu Hulan's turn. Liu Hulan calmly and generously lay down on the guillotine. For the cause of the Party and the people, she bravely and fearlessly went to her death.

　　生的伟大，死的光荣！
    ——追记模范共产党员刘胡兰
    刘胡兰同志是一九四七年一月十二日牺牲的，到现在已经四年多了。这个中国共产党的模范党员，中华民族的优秀儿女，永远活在中国人民的心中。刘胡兰同志牺牲以后，许多部队曾经掀起了“为刘胡兰报仇”的运动。毛主席曾经给刘胡兰同志写过挽词，说：“生的伟大，死的光荣。”
    刘胡兰同志是山西文水县云周西村人。文水在肥沃的晋中平原上，物产很丰富，但因阎锡山匪帮长期搜刮，农民过着非常穷苦的日子。抗日战争发生后，日寇侵占了文水县城及若干农村，阎锡山匪帮不战而溃。不久，当地人民在共产党领导下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗日斗争。刘胡兰十来岁的时候，在邻居金仙家里，见到了吕梁军区八分区敌工科干部刘芳同志。那时刘胡兰年纪太小，还不能理解刘芳这些人是作什么的。以后刘胡兰的年纪慢慢大了，懂的事情多了，她开始认识了刘芳他们所进行的英雄事业。以后，刘胡兰又在金仙家认识了中共文水县五区区委书记韩汝范和女干部吕雪梅。她直接受了党的影响，初步确定了自己应走的道路。
    一九四五年八月里，日寇投降了。人民解放军在九月一日解放了文水县城。但是，没有几天，阎锡山匪军又联合日伪军向山西人民大举进攻了。人民解放军坚持歼灭敌人有生力量的方针，暂时撤出文水城，而在广大的文水农村，与敌继续斗争。这时候，解放区的各种工作有了广大的发展，迫切需要干部。文水五区决定由吕雪梅同志负责主持训练一批妇女干部，训练班的地址在云周西村西北八里的贯家堡。刘胡兰决定参加学习，她知道老祖母必然拦阻，就偷偷地跑到训练班去受训。
    老祖母听到刘胡兰在贯家堡学习的消息，第二天一早就去找她，但是没有能够把她叫回来。
    四十天后，刘胡兰毕业回家，担任云周西村妇救会秘书。
    刘胡兰全心全意为人民办事，工作努力，进步很快。中共文水五区区委会组织委员石时芳，介绍她参加了中国共产党。在刘胡兰的生活历史中，这是一个根本的转变。
    从一九四六年五月中旬开始，阎锡山匪军出动五千八百多人，向文水交城一带解放区大举进攻。到六月底，匪军陆续增兵至一万五千多人。文水解放区的军民展开了英勇的自卫战争。云周西村的妇女，在刘胡兰和其他干部领导下，积极支援前线，募集了很多礼物，慰劳在前线作战的解放军。
    一九四六年十二月，人民解放军发动晋西战役。过去在文水一带坚持斗争的若干部队，转移到晋西作战。阎锡山匪帮乘此机会，以几个师的兵力，从北向南进攻，妄想摧毁平川上各个村镇里的人民政权，中国共产党组织和人民自卫武装的力量。
    敌人没有达到目的。在敌人到达云周西村之前，大部党员、干部积极分子，都安全转移了。但是，刘胡兰被敌人隔在村子里，没有来得及转移出去，刘胡兰决定当天夜里向山上转移。但是，天刚发亮，云周西村就被阎匪军和“民卫军”包围了。敌人强迫全村的男女老幼到村南大庙上集合。一家只许留一个人看门，留两个人的，就按通“匪”办理！
    村里的老乡们都被敌人赶到村南庙边的空场上了。刘胡兰挤在人丛中。
    会场上人们愤怒而紧张地等待着。有一个“民卫军”挤到人堆里，把刘胡兰拉到一旁，嘀嘀咕咕说了一阵。刘胡兰回到母亲身边，告诉母亲说：“他们要我今天‘自白’呵！他们说‘自白’了没事，不‘自白’要我的命……。”现在，她的脸色是坚决而严肃的，她准备接受就要到来的严重考验。她把手上的戒指，口袋里的手绢，都交给了母亲。
    敌人果然逮捕了刘胡兰。许多敌人把她拥到庙中，由一个军官问口供。敌人问：“你叫胡兰子？”刘胡兰说：“我就是刘胡兰。”敌人问：“你在村里净办过些什么事？”刘胡兰说：“我担任过妇救会的秘书。”敌人问：“已经有人供出你是个共产党员。”刘胡兰说：“我就是个共产党员！”敌人问：“你们村里还有谁是个共产党员？”刘胡兰说：“就我一个是共产党员。”敌人问：“八路军里边你认得些谁？”刘胡兰说：“我谁也不认得！”敌人气得拼命敲着桌子，吼叫着：“你十五岁的年纪，好嘴硬，你不怕死？”刘胡兰十分镇定地说：“要死，死就对了，我什么也不知道。”
    敌人问了半天，丝毫没有结果。敌人知道要刘胡兰供出对他们有用的材料，是非常困难的。于是决定首先让刘胡兰“保证今后再不给八路军办事”。敌人的话刚出口，刘胡兰马上说：“?可保不住！”
    敌人又说：“你今天跟我走了，可以不杀你！”
    刘胡兰只回答了两个字：“不行！”
    最后，敌人决定杀害刘胡兰。刘胡兰走到庙门口，又被阎匪军官唤住了。敌人准备进行最后一次欺骗的努力。但是，刘胡兰说：“还是哪个事情？那，不用谈了。”刘胡兰一甩头，走了出去。
    当敌人向群众宣布要处决的七个人的名单时，群众立刻骚动起来。敌人着了慌，赶忙支起机枪，向群众“准备放”。
    虐杀开始了。敌人先铡死石三怀，石四家、刘老三、张年成、石洋兵和七十多岁的陈猪则。这些人有的是干部家属，有的只是做过一点点革命工作，现在都壮烈牺牲了。
    最后轮到了刘胡兰。刘胡兰从容慷慨地躺到铡刀口上。为了党与人民的事业，她英勇无畏地就义了。
