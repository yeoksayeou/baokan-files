Reading Groups in Factories and Mines in Chongqing

　　Reading groups have been widely established among workers in factories and mines in Chongqing, making current affairs study a regular practice. According to statistics from ten major factories and mines, such as the 101 Steel Plant and the 610 Cotton Mill, there are already more than 670 reading groups. The private Shashi Cotton Mill's trade union organized 108 reading groups based on trade union member groups. Each group selects a reading affairs officer and a reader, who are supervised by the factory's workers' spare-time school. The factory trade union formulates outlines for current affairs study based on the central propaganda themes of each period. The spare-time school circles relevant materials in the newspaper daily according to the outlines and hands them over to each group for reading. More than 95 percent of the factory's workers receive regular current affairs education through daily reading and lecturing on the newspaper.

　　Many factories, when selecting newspaper materials to read, have greatly promoted practical work and consolidated and developed the reading organization by closely integrating them with the central work of each factory. For example, when the 610 Cotton Mill carried out the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the reading groups focused on reading news about the criminal facts of special agents and leaders of the Yiguan Tao in various places, which greatly aroused the workers' hatred for counter-revolutionaries and enabled all the workers in the factory to actively participate in the denunciation and exposure of counter-revolutionaries. As a result, the number of reading group members surged from less than 1,000 to more than 1,800.

　　Many reading groups, based on the materials in the newspaper, conduct reviews in connection with the problems existing in production within the group. For example, after reading news about how to unite the group and how to sign apprenticeship contracts, a reading group in a certain machinery factory held a meeting to discuss the existing problems in the group, thus improving the relationship between masters and apprentices and smoothly signing apprenticeship contracts. The workers in the factory realized the benefits of reading the newspaper, and their enthusiasm for reading was very high. Since May, the reading groups have ensured that no one is late or absent.

　　Reading groups in various factories can regularly hold current affairs quizzes. In the current affairs quizzes held in April and May in four factories, including Sichuan Cement Plant and Shashi Cotton Mill, 80 to 97 percent of the workers scored above 60 points. This proves that systematic reading of newspapers has achieved good results in strengthening workers' current affairs education.

　　重庆市各厂矿的读报组
    重庆市各厂矿职工普遍建立读报组，使时事学习走向经常化。据一零一钢铁厂、六一零纱厂等十个主要厂矿的统计，已有读报组六百七十余个。私营沙市纱厂工会以工会会员小组为单位，组织了一百零八个读报小组。每组选出读报干事和阅读员，由该厂职工业余学校负责领导。厂工会依据每个时期宣传中心制订时事学习的提纲。业余学校按照提纲逐日在报纸上圈出有关材料，交各小组阅读。该厂百分之九十五以上的工人，即由每天的读报讲报中受到了经常的时事教育。
    许多工厂在选读报纸材料时，由于密切结合了各该厂的中心工作，大大推动了实际工作，也巩固和发展了读报组织。如六一零纱厂在开展镇压反革命运动时，读报组即集中选读了各地特务分子和一贯道头子犯罪事实的新闻，大大激发了工人们对反革命分子的仇恨，使全厂工人都积极参加了对反革命分子的控诉和检举，读报组人数也因之由不到一千人激增到一千八百余人。
    许多读报组根据报纸的材料，联系小组内生产上存在的问题进行检讨。如某机械厂读报组读了关于如何使小组团结、如何订立师徒合同等新闻后，即就组内存在的问题开会讨论，因而改善了师徒关系，并顺利地签订了师徒合同。该厂工人体会到读报的好处，读报情绪非常高涨，从五月份以来读报组即已做到没有人迟到或缺席。
    各厂读报组大都能定期举行时事测验。四川水泥厂、沙市纱厂等四个厂在四、五月份的时事测验中，有百分之八十到九十七的职工，成绩都在六十分以上。这证明有系统的读报，对职工时事教育的加强，已收到良好效果。
