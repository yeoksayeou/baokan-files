Revising the Patriotic Pact to Launch a Production Increase and Donation Campaign
    ——A Record of the Donation Campaign at the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant
    By Our Reporter Jin Feng

　　The donation campaign at the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant has developed into an examination and revision of the patriotic pact. Based on the revised patriotic pact, a specific plan for increased production and donations for the year has been formulated, and a comprehensive donation campaign has been launched.

　　        (1) Launched a spontaneous donation campaign

　　Eight months of Resist America, Aid Korea education laid a solid foundation of patriotic ideology among the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant. On May 31, representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea conveyed to all the plant's workers the heroic and arduous deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean battlefield and their demands on the people of the motherland. That evening, workers in various workshops enthusiastically discussed how to support the People's Volunteers. Some workers donated three days', five days', or a week's wages, while others donated 3% or 5% of their monthly wages until the complete defeat of the American invaders in Korea. A spontaneous donation wave quickly formed throughout the plant. Gao Shirong, an old worker in the turbine workshop, donated his bonus from the previous year. Many workers linked their speeches to production and work. Yang Xiuzhen, a young female worker, cried and said, "How can we live such a happy life? We were not united a few days ago, and not working hard is really letting down the volunteers." Yang Jinsheng, a worker in the turbine workshop, said, "The volunteers are fighting arduously in Korea entirely for our sake. In the future, I will definitely put in twelve points of effort into production and never bow to difficulties. When encountering difficulties, we must think of the volunteers."

　　        (2) Clearly Proposed and Vigorously Implemented the Guideline of "Increase Production and Donate"

　　While the vigorous and spontaneous donation movement of the masses was developing, the China Peace Committee issued a call to donate airplanes, artillery, and other weapons. The enthusiasm of the masses rose even higher. Some advanced workers loudly shouted the slogan, "The more sweat we shed, the less blood the volunteers shed," and proposed the specific goal of donating airplanes. At the same time, starting with the donation of surveying instruments and high-speed grinding wheels by the Communist Youth League member Feng Bingwen, a mass movement to donate tools and equipment such as small motors, universal meters, transformers, cutter heads, and electric drills was launched throughout the plant, becoming a new aspect of the factory's donation movement.

　　The Shijingshan Power Plant's Communist Party General Branch, together with the administration and the trade union, studied and analyzed the demands and opinions of the masses and the call of the China Peace Committee, and determined the principle of "super-production and donation without affecting the workers' welfare and the national production plan," and also initially determined four methods of donation. First, increase production, implement the economic accounting system, and overfulfill the state's cost quota task. Accumulate more wealth for the country, increase income, and extract a portion or all of it for donation. Second, mobilize workers to carry out rationalization proposals and create new records, and donate a portion or all of the bonuses. Third, mobilize workers to continue donating equipment and tools. Fourth, with the active and voluntary requests of workers, agree to implement voluntary labor, donate wages, or other items.

　　The process of implementing this guideline and method was a process of mobilizing and educating the masses. First, the Party General Branch convened党员meetings and propagandist meetings to enable党员and propagandists to grasp the guideline of "increase production and donation" and to be able to宣传to the masses that "increase production and donation" combines the political movement of Resist America and Aid Korea and support the front line with promoting the completion of the factory's central task—production. Secondly, the administration and the trade union jointly convened labor model symposiums and technical personnel symposiums, and at the same time mobilized advanced production teams to discuss specific methods of increasing production and calculate the specific amount of increased income. National labor model Liu Dezhen, advanced production team Liang Fengchang team, and others put forward many specific methods such as breaking through state quotas, further reducing coal consumption, adjusting labor organization, improving production technology, utilizing waste materials for reproduction, and saving materials, and initially calculated that they could超额produce six or seven billion of wealth for the country. The factory's administrative leaders also calculated the profits that could be超额produced from aspects such as factory management and reducing costs. The results of the calculation by both the leaders and the masses provided a specific plan for increasing production and donation, and determined the specific goal of donating airplanes. Finally, the convening of the Patriotic Increase Production and Donation Conference became a mobilization meeting for all the plant's workers to fully engage in the donation movement. A model of the "Capital Power Plant Workers' Airplane" was hung in the meeting place, and the emotions of the masses were extremely enthusiastic. Many advanced producers reported the specific plans they had formulated for increasing production and donation within half a year. The slogan they shouted, "Strive to donate the Capital Power Plant Workers' Airplane," became the central slogan for launching the increase production and donation movement throughout the plant.

　　        (3) Check and Revise the Patriotic Pact, Comprehensively Launch the Mass Movement of Increasing Production and Donating

　　The leadership of the Shijingshan Power Plant grasped the link of revising the patriotic pact and promoted all the plant's workers to formulate specific plans for increasing production and donation this year, centering on the central task.

　　In April, the entire plant and various groups had established patriotic pacts, and in May, the trade union inspected them once. The grassroots masses generally implemented the pacts very seriously. However, the general shortcomings were that the content was relatively fragmented and abstract, and there was no centralized goal to strive for. The patriotic pacts of some groups, especially the staff groups, became a mere formality. Generally, cadres and masses also lacked sufficient understanding of the political significance of the patriotic pacts, and some equated them with general work rules or production plans.

　　The first step in revising the patriotic pact this time was to once again launch a study of the patriotic pact throughout the plant. Through the study and discussion of the People's Daily editorial on the patriotic pact by all the plant's workers, as well as repeated explanations in Party classes, propagandist meetings, and various cadre meetings, the majority of workers further realized that the patriotic pact is a program of patriotic action for everyone. Secondly, the leaders focused on cultivating several advanced production teams such as Liu Dezhen and Liang Fengchang, specifically helping them to revise their team's patriotic pact as a typical demonstration; the revised pacts of their teams were printed and distributed to all the plant's workers as the basis for revising and supplementing their own team's pacts. Finally, the trade union reviewed and determined them.

　　The biggest characteristic of the patriotic pact revision movement throughout the plant was the formulation of patriotic increase production and donation plans and the launch of a rationalization proposal movement. According to preliminary statistics, the plant's workers have put forward more than 20 effective methods to improve production and increase production. All the groups, centering on the struggle against accidents, have formulated specific plans for donation in half a year. For example, the Liu Dezhen team's patriotic pact proposed that each person donate one day of work per month, revive 40 large barrels of turbine oil in stock, which can save 170 million yuan; repair one abandoned machine and one pump each; conscientiously study the acceptance regulations and maintenance regulations, and strive to become an inspection-free team; ensure the completion of the plan by 5% per month; save 2,000 jin of millet per month; and put forward at least one rationalization proposal per month, and donate half of the bonus income. The Liang Fengchang team in the boiler room guarantees that the annual coal consumption will be further reduced to 0.685, saving more than 400 million yuan for the country. The workers in the repair shop want to self-manufacture 20 tons of steel balls for coal grinders, which can save 170 million yuan. The workers in the transportation field propose to rationally organize the labor force and unload coal without external force, which can save 150 million yuan in transportation costs. Other groups have also proposed screw revival, waste iron recycling, steel file renewal, self-made machines, pumps, cinder bricks, etc., which can save two or three hundred million yuan.

　　The revision of the patriotic pact this time has already taken effect in a short period of days. The labor efficiency of the ash transport class has increased by 20%. Old worker Meng Guangshan used to be relatively slack in production. This time, when he revised the patriotic pact, he took the initiative to propose: filing electric saws and tidying up the workplace after work. He said, "Doing voluntary work is to support the volunteers, and using waste materials is equivalent to eliminating American devils!"

　　Now, the Shijingshan Power Plant is preparing to launch a workshop's patriotic increase production competition as a guarantee for practicing the patriotic pact and promoting the increase production and donation movement.

　　修订爱国公约展开增产捐献运动
    ——记北京石景山发电厂的捐献运动
    本报记者　金凤
    北京石景山发电厂的捐献运动，已发展到检查和修订爱国公约；又在爱国公约的修订的基础上，订出了本年内增产捐献的具体计划，全面展开了捐献运动。
            （一）掀起了自发性的捐献运动
    八个月来的抗美援朝教育，奠定了石景山发电厂职工深厚的爱国主义思想基础。五月三十一日，中国人民赴朝慰问团代表，向全厂职工传达了中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场英勇、艰苦的事迹以及他们对祖国人民的要求。当天晚上，各个车间的工人就热烈地讨论怎样来支援人民志愿军。工人们有的捐工资三天，五天，有的捐一星期，有的捐工资每月百分之三，百分之五，一直捐到彻底打垮了侵朝美军为止。全厂很快形成了自发性的捐款热潮。汽机车间老工人高世荣，把他在去年积存的奖金捐了出来。许多工人发言中都联系了生产和工作。青年女工杨秀贞哭着说：“我们凭什么过这样幸福日子，前些日子还闹不团结，不好好工作实在对不起志愿军。”汽机车间工人杨金生说：“志愿军在朝鲜艰苦作战，完全是为了我们。以后我一定拿出十二分力量搞生产，决不向困难低头。遇到困难就要想到志愿军。”
            （二）明确提出并大力贯彻“增产捐献”的方针
    在群众蓬蓬勃勃的自发的捐款运动正在发展的时候，中国人民抗美援朝总会发出了捐献飞机大炮等武器的号召。群众的热情，更见高扬起来。一部分先进工人，响亮地喊出：“我们多流一滴汗，志愿军少流一滴血”的口号，提出捐献飞机的具体奋斗目标。同时，从青年团员冯炳文捐献了经纬仪，高速沙轮等器材开始，全厂又掀起捐献小马达、万能电表、变压器、刀头、电钻等工具、器材的群众性的运动，成为工厂捐献运动的新内容。
    中共石景山发电厂总支委员会和行政、工会一起研究和分析了群众的要求、意见和中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，确定了“不影响职工生活福利和国家生产计划，超额生产捐献”的原则，也初步确定了捐献的四个办法。第一，增加生产，实施经济核算制，超额完成国家的成本定额任务。为国家多积累财富，增加收入，抽出一部或全部来捐献。第二，发动职工，开展合理化建议与创造新纪录，捐献奖金的一部或全部。第三，发动职工继续捐献器材、工具。第四，在职工积极自愿要求下，同意实行义务劳动、捐献工资或其他。
    贯彻这一方针与办法的过程，是一个发动群众教育群众的过程。先由党总支召开党员大会、宣传员会议，使党员、宣传员掌握“增产捐献”的方针，并能向群众宣传“增产捐献”是使抗美援朝、支援前线的政治运动与推动完成工厂中心任务——生产相结合。其次，由行政和工会双方联合召开劳动模范座谈会、技术人员座谈会，同时发动先进生产小组来讨论增加生产的具体办法，计算增加收入的具体数目。全国劳动模范刘德珍、先进生产小组梁凤昌小组等都提出了突破国家定额、煤耗再降低、调整劳动组织、改进生产技术、利用废料再生产、节省器材等许多具体办法，初步算出为国家超额生产六、七亿的财富。工厂行政领导方面也从工厂管理、降低成本等方面计算了可以超额生产的利润。领导和群众双方算帐的结果，就为增产捐献提出了具体方案，确定了捐献飞机这一具体目标。最后召开爱国增产捐献大会，就成为全厂职工全面卷入捐献运动的动员大会。会场上悬挂着“首都发电厂工人号”的飞机模型，群众的情绪极为热烈。许多先进生产者报告了他们拟定的半年内增产捐献的具体计划。他们所喊出的：“为捐献首都发电厂工人号飞机而斗争”的口号，就成为全厂展开增产捐献运动的中心口号。
            （三）检查和修订爱国公约，全面展开增产捐献的群众运动
    石景山发电厂领导方面掌握了修订爱国公约这一环节，推动全厂职工，围绕中心工作，订出了本年增产捐献的具体计划。
    四月中全厂和小组已订立了爱国公约，五月中由工会检查了一次。基层群众执行公约一般都很认真。但普遍的缺点是内容比较零碎、抽象，没有一个集中的奋斗目标。部分小组尤其是职员小组的爱国公约流于形式。一般干部和群众对爱国公约的政治意义也还认识不足，有的把它等同于一般工作守则或生产计划。
    此次修订爱国公约的第一步，是在全厂再次展开关于爱国公约的学习。通过全厂职工对于人民日报爱国公约社论的学习、讨论以及党课、宣传员会议，各种干部会议的反复解释，大部分职工进一步认识了爱国公约是每个人爱国行动的纲领。其次，领导上有重点地培养刘德珍、梁凤昌等几个先进生产小组，具体帮助他们修订他们小组的爱国公约，作为典型示范；将他们小组修订好的公约，印发全厂职工作为修订和补充本组公约的依据。最后由工会审查，加以确定。
    全厂修订爱国公约运动最大的特点是订立爱国增产捐献计划、开展合理化建议运动。据初步统计，该厂工人已提出二十多种改进生产、提高生产的有效办法。各小组都围绕着反事故斗争，订出了半年捐献的具体计划。如刘德珍小组爱国公约中提出每人每月献工一日，复活库存四十大桶透平油，可以节省一亿七千万元；修好废存机、泵各一台；认真学习验收规程和检修规程，争取做免检小组；保证每月超额完成计划百分之五；每月节约二千斤小米以及每月至少提出合理化建议一件，捐献所得奖金的一半。锅炉房梁凤昌小组保证全年煤耗再降低至○·六八五，为国家节省四亿多元。修理场工人要自制磨煤机用的钢球二十吨，可以节省一亿七千万元。运输场工人提出合理组织劳动力，不用外力卸煤，可以省下运输费一亿五千万元。其他各小组也都提出螺丝复活、废铁翻身、钢锉整新，自制机、泵、炉灰砖等，可以省下两三亿元。
    这次爱国公约的修订，在短短几天内已经发生了作用。运灰班劳动效率已提高了百分之二十。老工友孟广山过去生产比较松懈，这次他在修订爱国公约时候，主动提出：下班以后锉电锯、整理工作场。他说：“做义务工是为了支援志愿军，利用废料等于消灭美国鬼子！”
    现在，石景山发电厂正准备展开车间的爱国增产竞赛，作为实践爱国公约和推进增产捐献运动的保证。
