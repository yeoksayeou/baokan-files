Most regions of China have begun harvesting wheat, with harvesting already completed in areas where the season started earlier. In China's major wheat-producing areas, including Henan, northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Shandong, and the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi Province, wheat has generally enjoyed a bumper harvest this year, with yields at 80% or above. Zhejiang Province saw approximately 90% of a normal year, with production increasing by 20% compared to last year. In Henan Province's Xuchang, Xinyang, Huaiyang, Luoyang, and other special districts, wheat ears are large and full, and the wheat stalks are robust, with an average yield of around 120 jin per mu. Areas that used improved wheat varieties last year have seen particularly good wheat harvests; in the suburbs of Kaifeng, 200,000 mu of improved wheat varieties yielded 10 to 20 jin per mu more than ordinary wheat. In the plains provinces north of the Yellow River and the southern part of Hebei Province, due to late wheat sowing last winter and drought this spring, the average yield is approximately 60 jin per mu, a decrease of 10 to 19 jin compared to last year. Wheat in provinces such as western Sichuan, northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and Yunnan is at about 50% to 60% of a normal year. Preliminary estimates indicate that although the sown area of winter wheat decreased nationwide and some areas experienced reduced production this summer, due to the universal bumper harvest in the major wheat-producing areas of the country, the national wheat output this year will still be much higher than last year.

In order to complete the wheat harvest in a timely manner, farmers across the country are enthusiastically launching summer harvest and summer selection competitions. To date, more than 1,000 mutual aid teams have responded to the challenge first proposed by 47 mutual aid teams in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province. Under their influence, many regions have also launched competitions between townships, villages, and mutual aid teams. The farmers' enthusiasm for harvesting and labor efficiency have greatly improved. To protect the wheat harvest, counties, districts, and townships in Henan and Hebei provinces have established wheat protection organizations, and militia in various villages have begun patrolling and guarding wheat fields and threshing grounds. Farmers in some villages have also formulated wheat protection covenants and measures, implementing joint village defense to strictly prevent bandits and special agents from sabotaging the wheat harvest.

　　我国大部地区开始收麦
　  主要产麦区小麦普遍丰收
    华东、中南、西南、西北和华北部分地区已开始收麦，季节较早的地区已收割完毕。我国主要产麦区河南、苏北、皖北、山东和陕西省关中地区，今年小麦普遍丰收，收成在八成以上；浙江省约有九成年景，比去年增产二成。河南省许昌、信阳、淮阳、洛阳等专区，小麦穗大粒实，麦棵茁壮，每亩产量平均都在一百二十斤左右。去年选用优良麦种的地区，小麦收成特别好，开封城郊区二十万亩良种小麦，每亩较普通小麦增产十斤至二十斤。黄河以北平原省和河北省南部地区，由于去冬小麦播种较晚，加上今春天旱，平均每亩约产六十斤左右，较去年减产十斤至十九斤；川西、川北、川东和云南等省区小麦约有五、六成年景。据初步估计，全国去冬小麦播种面积虽然减少，今夏且有部分地区减产，但由于全国主要产麦地区普遍丰收，因此，今年全国小麦产量仍较去年增加很多。
    为着及时地完成麦收工作，现在全国各地农民正在热烈地开展夏收、夏选的竞赛。截至目前为止，各地已有一千多个互助组向首先提出竞赛的陕西省兴平县四十七个互助组应战。在他们的影响下，许多地区也开展了乡与乡、村与村、互助组与互助组之间的竞赛。农民的收麦情绪及劳动效率大大提高。为着保护麦收，河南、河北两省各县、区、乡并建立了护麦的组织，各村的民兵已开始巡逻放哨，保护麦田和场地。有些乡村的农民并订出了护麦公约和办法，实行村村联防，严防土匪特务破坏麦收。
