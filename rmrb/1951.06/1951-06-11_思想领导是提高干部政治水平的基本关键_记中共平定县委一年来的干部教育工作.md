　　Ideological Leadership is the Basic Key to Improving the Political Level of Cadres
    ——A Record of the Cadre Education Work of the CPC Pingding County Committee Over the Past Year
　　The Organization Department of the CPC Pingding County Committee
    Under the leadership of the CPC Pingding County Committee, the party members and cadres of Pingding County, Shanxi Province, have significantly improved their ideological awareness over the past year through the Party Congress, the rectification movement, and especially the county-wide Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Last spring, individualism among cadres in Pingding County and districts was quite serious. Especially during the re-division of districts, many cadres wanted to take the opportunity to return home. At that time, a chaotic situation of "old cadres leaving and new cadres not yet arriving" formed in the districts. Among the forty-six main district-level cadres in the county, twenty-two were not at ease with their work. When the districts assigned work, some cadres requested, "Wherever my home is, assign me there." Some cadres' thoughts were, "Compare work with the backward, compare living conditions with the peasants, compare the contract system with the salary system." The most serious cases led to passive retirement ideas. Some even said, "What's the point of being a party member if difficulties are raised but not resolved?" Some said, "I'll go home to produce and let my son study. When he grows up, he can support the whole family. Isn't this a long-term benefit?" After the Party Congress, the rectification movement, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the situation fundamentally changed. According to comrades from the county government's Civil Affairs Section, last year, most letters from cadres said "family difficulties" and requested to quit. This year is different. They are either reporting on work or inquiring about various policies. Comrade Liu Xianzong, the organization member of the 11th District Committee, made a self-criticism: "In the past, I had no mass viewpoint, only individual private concepts. Therefore, the richer the people became, the more troubled I was. Now I understand that the reason I progressed slowly in the past was because of this." Last spring, among 254 cadres, half had retirement ideas, even passively neglecting their work. But this year, only eight cadres have retirement ideas left.

    At the same time, cadres cleared away complacency and improved their political vigilance and fighting spirit. In the early stages of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, half of the cadres in the county still had thoughts of underestimating the enemy and complacency. After Resist America, Aid Korea education, the number of cadres with such thoughts has been reduced to four. Comrade Li Shunlai said, "When the American imperialists started the war of aggression against Korea, the reactionary landlords of Ganjing Village applauded. The actions of the American imperialists and the reactionary landlords of Ganjing Village were completely consistent." Comrade Liang Yuzhen said, "The American imperialists are fighting the war of aggression against Korea fiercely, the landlords are counterattacking fiercely, and the rumors of the Yiguandao are spreading fiercely." Therefore, everyone improved their class vigilance and strengthened their fighting spirit.

    The work attitude of cadres has also changed significantly. In the past, many cadres did work by "running errands," going to the countryside to collect statistics on the production achievements of the masses, and then returning to the county or district to report. Now it is different. Cadres can all study their work in depth and use the masses' level of awareness and action to check the effectiveness of their work. Therefore, work efficiency has greatly improved. Last winter, when the county summarized its work, it affirmed the progress of Xia Panshi Village. At the meeting, many comrades accepted the experience of the village and checked their own work. Comrade Li Xiufeng of the county government's Education Section said, "Xia Panshi's transformation from a backward village to an advanced village is mainly due to the working cadres guiding the masses to combine political struggle with economic construction, and being able to integrate with the masses and boldly rely on the masses. I didn't do this in Baiyangbao." Guo Ruichun, the district head of the 5th District, said, "The work in Lian Zhuang, which I led, was not done well. It's not that the masses are backward, but that my thinking is backward." Li Shunlai said, "In the past, I was responsible to the higher-ups, but not to the lower-downs. Now, the facts prove that all work can only be done well by educating and relying on the masses." In the past, cadres always mechanically conveyed what the higher authorities said when they came back from meetings in the county. They rarely discussed or studied the documents and instructions issued by the higher authorities, and some even didn't read them at all. Now, most of them can formulate their own work plans based on the instructions and resolutions of the higher authorities in combination with the actual situation of the local area, and can regularly check and summarize their work. During the Resist America, Aid Korea movement this spring, the 11th District Committee first studied and analyzed the situation in its district, specifically discussed the basic content of the movement and the methods of organizing and leading the movement, and formulated a work plan for the entire district, thus enabling the movement to develop quickly and powerfully. The District Committee also learned to promote the general through typical examples as a leadership method. In the past, many district cadres were unwilling to approach leading cadres, fearing that leading cadres would inquire about their work. Now, many cadres can actively ask leading comrades for instructions and report to them, asking leading comrades to help them solve problems in their work.

    How did the significant changes in the thinking and work of county and district cadres in Pingding County come about in the past year? Mainly from two aspects:

    First, various mass political movements educated the cadres. In the past year, cadres have been working in various mass political movements, thus improving themselves. Especially in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, cadres not only received general political education, but also heard the masses' accusations of the enemy's trampling and saw the actions of the awakened masses resolutely fighting the enemy. In the party member training class, party members sadly recounted the facts of their parents, wives, siblings being brutally murdered, kidnapped, and raped by the enemy, which deeply moved the cadres. Comrade Ren Jintian of the county government said, "After hearing the masses' grievances, I felt very ashamed. The masses have so much hatred that has not been avenged, and the enemy has not been completely eliminated, yet I am not working hard." Comrade Yang Zhizhong of the County Youth Work Committee, who originally wanted to retire and return home, saw more than 700 young people in the county requesting to join the volunteer army, which aroused a strong struggle in his heart. He said, "I am not as good as a peasant. A peasant can go to the front line to defend the motherland and fight American devils after being awakened. And I am a cadre of several years and a Communist Party member, but I keep worrying about my family. This is such a serious mistake, how shameful it is!" Then he also went to request to join the volunteer army. When the peasants exposed all the evils of the enemy and pursued its essence, many cadres realized that "the class struggle is so acute, but we are cadres, some of whom are even Communist Party members, not serving the people well, but making personal issues. This is completely losing the revolutionary qualities, and Communist Party members are losing the qualities of Communist Party members."

    Second, the cadres were educated through typical facts, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, affirming achievements, and criticizing shortcomings and errors. The county-wide cadre meeting held in mid-February this year summarized the previous stage of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and used the method of typical demonstration to check their work and thinking. The discussion and summary of the work in Xia Panshi and Xiye Villages educated all the cadres and improved everyone's ideological level. Many cadres said: "We are determined to create a second Xia Panshi." At the end of April, in preparation for welcoming the "May 1st" Popularizing and Deepening the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, the County Committee held another county-wide cadre meeting. At the meeting, a work report was made on the typical village of Xita Yan. Each cadre linked it with their own work and thinking, launched criticisms, comparisons, and made self-criticisms. Comrade Wang Jiulin said, "Comrade Wang Zhanqin, who works in Xita Yan, serves the people wholeheartedly, so he did his job well. In the past, I served myself wholeheartedly. I always felt sick. Today I asked for a doctor, tomorrow I took pills. When I went to the countryside and couldn't get boiled water, I asked to be transferred. In the past, taking medicine didn't cure the disease, but today I took this good medicine (the Xita Yan Village work report), which cured my disease. In the future, I will wholeheartedly do my job well." At that time, all the cadres competed to speak, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Based on this review and summary, all agencies formulated patriotic pacts and launched a county-wide work competition movement.

    At the same time, the County Committee paid attention to educating cadres with vivid facts of class struggle. The County Committee personally organized cadres to participate in mass grievance meetings. When holding the county-wide work meeting in March this year, it organized cadres to visit the mass grievance meetings in the three streets of Dongguan Street, Shizi Street, and Xuemen Street in Pingding City. This not only improved the cadres' class consciousness, but also enabled the cadres to learn ideological leadership.

　　思想领导是提高干部政治水平的基本关键
    ——记中共平定县委一年来的干部教育工作
　　中共平定县委组织部
    山西省平定县的党员干部，在中共平定县委领导下，一年来，经过了党代表会、整风运动、特别是全县规模的抗美援朝运动，思想觉悟都显著地提高了。去年春天，平定县、区干部中的个人主义闹得相当严重。尤其是重新划区的时候，不少干部都想乘机回家。这时区里形成了“旧干部已走，新干部未来”的混乱状态。全县四十六个区级主要干部，就有二十二个不安心工作。区里分配工作时，有的干部要求“家在那里，分到那里”。有些干部的思想是“工作向落后比，光景和农民比，包干制和薪金制比”。最严重的，产生了消极退休思想。有的甚至说：“困难提出不解决，要党籍干什么？”有的说：“我回家生产，让儿子念书，长大养活全家，这不是长远利益吗？”经过党代表会、整风运动与抗美援朝运动，情况有了根本的转变。据县政府民政科同志谈，去年干部来信，多半是说“家庭困难”，要求不干。今年可不同了，不是报告工作，就是询问各种政策。十一区区委会组织员刘宪忠同志自我检讨说：“过去我没有群众观点，只有个人私有观念，因此，人民越富裕，自己越苦恼。现在了解了，过去所以进步慢，就是因为这个。”去年春天，二百五十四个干部中，就有一半有退休思想，甚至消极怠工。但今年有退休思想的干部只剩下八个了。
    同时，干部也清除了麻痹思想，提高了政治警惕性与斗志。抗美援朝运动初期，在全县干部中，还有一半人有轻敌麻痹思想。经过抗美援朝教育后，有轻敌麻痹思想的干部已减至四人。李顺来同志说：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争开始，甘井村反动地主拍手称快。美帝国主义和甘井村反动地主的行动完全一致。”梁玉珍同志说：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜战争打得紧，地主反攻得紧，一贯道谣言传得紧。”因此，大家提高了阶级警惕性，加强了斗志。
    干部的工作态度也有显著的变化。过去不少干部作工作是“跑工作”，下乡统计一下群众的生产成绩，就回县、区汇报。现在不同了，干部都能钻研工作，并以群众的觉悟程度与行动来检查自己的工作效果，因此工作效率大大提高。去年冬天全县总结工作时，肯定了下磐石村的进步的成绩。会上很多同志接受该村经验，检查了自己的工作。县政府教育科的李秀峰同志说：“下磐石由落后村变成先进村，主要是工作干部引导群众把政治斗争与经济建设结合起来了，并能和群众打成一片，大胆依靠群众。我在白羊堡就没有这样作。”五区区长郭瑞春说：“我领导的连庄工作没搞好，不是群众落后，而是我的思想落后。”李顺来同志说：“过去是对上负责，对下不负责，现在，事实证明，一切工作只有教育群众、依靠群众才能作好。”过去干部从县里开会回来，总是把上级讲的一套，硬向下搬；上级发下的文件、指示，很少讨论研究，甚至不看。现在大都能够根据上级的指示、决议结合当地实际情况，制定自己工作的方案，并能定期检查、总结自己的工作。如今春抗美援朝运动中，十一区区委首先研究分析了本区情况，具体讨论了运动的基本内容和组织领导运动的方法，制定出全区的工作方案，因而使运动迅速而有力地开展起来。区委并学会了通过典型推动一般的领导方法。过去不少区干部不愿接近领导干部，怕领导干部查问自己的工作，现在很多干部能主动向领导同志请示报告，要求领导同志帮助他们解决工作中的问题。
    一年来平定县的县、区干部在思想上、工作上的显著变化是怎样得来的呢？主要是从两个方面：
    第一、各种群众性的政治运动教育了干部。一年来干部在各种群众性的政治运动中工作着，因此提高了自己。特别是在抗美援朝运动中，干部不仅受到一般的政治教育，还听到群众对敌人蹂躏的控诉，看到觉悟起来的群众与敌人坚决斗争的行动。党员训练班里，党员悲愤地诉说自己父母妻子、兄弟姊妹，惨遭敌人杀掳、强奸的事实，干部听了后非常感动。县政府任进田同志说：“我听到群众诉苦后，感到非常惭愧。群众有这样多的仇恨未报，敌人还没有彻底肃清，自己却不好好地工作。”本来想退休回家的县青年工作委员会的杨志忠同志，看到全县七百余青年要求参加志愿军，内心就引起了强烈的斗争，他说：“我不如农民，一个农民觉悟起来后还能为保卫祖国奔赴前线，打美国鬼子；而我是几年的干部，又是共产党员，却一再牵挂家庭。这是多么严重的错误，这多么可耻啊！”接着他也去要求参加志愿军。农民在揭发敌人一切罪恶并追其本质时，不少干部体会到“阶级斗争如此尖锐，可是咱们身为干部，有的还是共产党员，不好好为人民服务，闹个人问题，这是完全丧失了革命品质，共产党员则是丧失了共产党员的品质。”
    第二、通过典型事实，开展批评与自我批评，肯定成绩，批判缺点、错误，教育了干部。今年二月中旬召开的全县干部会议，总结了前段抗美援朝运动，以典型示范的方法，检查自己工作和思想。在讨论与总结下磐石与西冶村工作中，教育了全体干部，提高了大家的思想水平。不少干部表示：“下决心搞个下磐石第二”。四月底，准备迎接“五一”普及深入抗美援朝运动，县委又召开了一次全县干部大会，会上作了西塔岩典型村工作报告，每个干部联系自己的工作、思想，展开了批评，对比，作了自我检讨。王久林同志说：“在西塔岩工作的王占钦同志是全心全意为人民服务，所以把工作作好了。我过去是全心全意为自己服务，总觉得有病，今天请医生，明天吃药丸，下乡喝不上开水就要求调动工作。过去吃药没治了病，今天吃了这付良药（西塔岩村工作报告），可把我的病治好了，今后要全心全意把工作作好。”当时全体干部争先发言，情绪空前热烈，在此检查、总结基础上各机关都订立了爱国公约，开展了全县规模的工作竞赛运动。
    同时，县委注意了用活生生的阶级斗争事实教育干部。县委亲自组织干部参加群众诉苦会，今年三月开全县工作会议时，就组织干部参观了平定城东关街、十字街、学门街三个街的群众诉苦大会。这样既提高了干部的阶级觉悟，又使干部学会了思想领导。
