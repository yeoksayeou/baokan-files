　　Some Comrades Do Not Pay Enough Attention to the Discussion of the Film "The Life of Wu Xun"
    Free Attitude Should Be Changed Immediately
    (I) To the Editors:
    Since the People's Daily has continuously published articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun," discussions have sprung up within our organization, revealing three different ideological situations and corresponding perspectives and attitudes toward this issue.

    First, there are those who highly value the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." They diligently read the articles criticizing "The Life of Wu Xun" and use the correct viewpoints within them to criticize their past erroneous understanding of Wu Xun and its ideological roots. They have all developed a correct understanding of Wu Xun and are promoting explanations to comrades who are either uninterested in this issue or have a unclear understanding of Wu Xun. This group represents only a minority.

    Second, there are those who are indifferent to the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." Some merely curiously glance at the articles discussing "The Life of Wu Xun." Others listen to the debates on this issue without expressing approval or disapproval, showing no attitude, as if this issue is irrelevant to them and studying it is optional. This group constitutes the majority.

    Third, there are those whose understanding of "The Life of Wu Xun" is erroneous and whose thoughts are very confused. For example, they say things like "the demands on Wu Xun should not be too harsh" or "Wu Xun's spirit of enduring hardship to establish schools is still good," and so on.

    The majority of the staff in our organization are so numb and indifferent to this principled ideological struggle concerning the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which is indeed a very serious problem. The May 20th People's Daily editorial has clearly pointed out that the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" should be valued. But according to my understanding, some organizations also have similar situations to ours on this issue. Therefore, I suggest that the study committees of various organizations should pay attention to the study of this issue and lead this study in a planned manner, so that everyone can achieve consistency in thought and understanding, and improve everyone's political theoretical level in this study.

     (II) To the Editors:
    Since newspapers have continuously published many articles discussing the film "The Life of Wu Xun," many organizations and groups have also begun to launch studies and discussions. However, some comrades do not sufficiently understand the significance of this discussion and are therefore not very concerned. Many times, I have found that some comrades, when they see others studying the articles discussing "The Life of Wu Xun" in the newspaper, think it has little to do with them and walk away indifferently. Some comrades, although they also participate in the discussion, only speak a whole lot about "Wu Xun was born in 1838, when foreign capitalism invaded China..." without relating it to their own thinking.

    I think these situations are harmful to us. Therefore, I suggest that comrades from various organizations, troops, and groups should conduct a deeper discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun."

　　Where Does the Root of My Erroneous Thought of Worshipping Wu Xun Lie? To the Editors:
    My mind was poisoned too deeply in the past, and I always admired Wu Xun. Especially after watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the poison was compounded, making my worship of Wu Xun even stronger.

    It was not until I read the May 20th People's Daily editorial "The Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun' Should Be Valued" and the article "Communists Should Participate in the Criticism of 'The Life of Wu Xun'" that I began to realize that my past worship of Wu Xun was a serious mistake.

    Why did such a principled serious ideological error occur?

    First of all, this is inseparable from my family background (landlord family) and the education I received from the feudal class and the reactionary ruling class of the Kuomintang for a long time. From the age of six, I was subjected to the ideological education of the feudal exploiting class in the private school presided over by my grandfather. The content taught in the private school was exactly the same as that in the "free schools" run by Wu Xun, which was a set of "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior," and "loyalty to the emperor and love for the country." I myself completely accepted this statement at the time. By the time I was in elementary and middle school, my family had already begun to decline; but my father still wanted me to go for "advanced studies" despite the family's economic difficulties. The reason was simple: after graduating from university, I could "rise in rank and get rich" and "honor my ancestors." This reactionary education of the exploiting class of "rising in rank and getting rich" is the basic reason for the formation of my serious error.

    Secondly, it is my dogmatic learning method and lack of a realistic and truth-seeking learning attitude. For example, I have studied the history of social development three times before and after, and I think I have gained a lot and have learned the truth of looking at problems from a developmental perspective; and I think there is no point in studying it any further. But the fact proves that when I come into contact with specific issues (such as Wu Xun and the film "The Life of Wu Xun"), I make mistakes. This shows that my dogmatic learning method, which is divorced from reality, and my "ambitious" learning attitude seriously hinder my progress and political improvement.

    My lack of knowledge of Chinese history and the bad habit of making rash judgments and conclusions without detailed investigation and research are also one of the reasons for the erroneous understanding of Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun."

    Through the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," I have recognized the reasons for making mistakes. In the future, I am determined to thoroughly criticize the past erroneous learning methods and learning attitudes, earnestly study Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, and use Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to improve my awareness and train my ideological combat ability.
                        Reader Wu Gang
　　Use the Weapon of Marxism to Expose the True Face of Wu Xun and the Like To the Editors:
    I am a history teacher. After studying "History of Social Development" and "Historical Materialism and Dialectical Materialism," I thought I had clarified many issues. But after reading the articles about Wu Xun and "The Life of Wu Xun" by Yang Er and other comrades, I was shocked and realized that my study was far from enough, and I only had a superficial understanding of the provisions of dialectical materialism, and I became confused when I encountered specific problems. Especially when everyone said "Wu Xun is good," and even raised the "banner of cultural liberation of the working people" to praise him, I became even more confused. I forgot the historical motto "In order not to make mistakes in politics, one must look forward, not backward," "one must be a revolutionary, not a reformist" (History of the CPSU(B) Chapter Four Section Two); I forgot the principle of measuring historical figures should be based on whether they have promoted the development of history. I was completely blinded by Wu Xun's "bizarre and strange behaviors."

    I teach history, and when I talk about the cultural policies of the rulers of the past to fool the people, I always try my best to expose its essence in making "all the heroes in the world come into my trap." But I believe that Wu Xun's active help to the rulers in cultivating lackeys is "free school," is "sacrificing oneself to serve the people"!

    How touching is the heroic spirit of peasant archetypes in Chinese history such as Li Zicheng! And how disgusting is Wu Xun's servility! But I followed suit and regarded him as a typical representative of Chinese peasants, and even wanted to teach my students to learn his "professional spirit."

    I remember when I was studying at North China United University in 1948, President Cheng Fangwu taught us to "think freely." He said: I dare to guarantee that none of you dare to say that you can "think freely." Because when you consider issues, Confucius, Hu Shi and others often dominate your minds, so if you want to be able to "think freely," you must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (the general idea). Today, comparing my past view of Wu Xun with these few words, I feel even more thought-provoking!

　　Through the Discussion of the Film "The Life of Wu Xun," We Must Establish Correct Educational Views To the Editors:
    Many students in normal universities have watched the film "The Life of Wu Xun," and they, like many people, are confused by this poisonous film. Some students tell everyone they meet how "great" Wu Xun is. After the articles criticizing Wu Xun by Yang Er and other comrades were published, although the students felt that these articles were quite reasonable, they could not negate Wu Xun because of this. It was not until the People's Daily published the editorial "The Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun' Should Be Valued" that the student union began to pay attention to this issue. According to the student union's understanding of some students' thoughts: some people think that Wu Xun has at least "worked hard" even if he has no merit; some people think that "Wu Xun was born in the late Qing Dynasty and was limited by the historical conditions at the time." Is it "too harsh" to demand him by today's standards; some people think that Wu Xun served the feudal ruling class, but after all, he "also ran free schools" and "improved the culture of the working people"... All this shows that our students' thoughts are quite chaotic. Our normal university students are preparing to serve the people's education. If we cannot clearly understand that education should be closely integrated with the current political struggle and serve politics, and if we do not thoroughly criticize the purely educational point of view and the mechanical historical point of view, what serious consequences will result! Therefore, it is very necessary to launch a discussion on "The Life of Wu Xun" in our normal university.

    Therefore, the student union first used the radio to introduce the "China Youth Daily" editorial "Young People Should Participate in the Discussion of 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" calling on students to launch a heated discussion and meticulously formulate a study plan. On May 30, the student union convened a meeting of study team leaders from various classes, clearly stating that the discussion of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" is a principled ideological struggle. Therefore, students should be mobilized to seriously examine their own thoughts and discover problems. On the evening of May 31, Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs Ding Haochuan made an enlightening report. Deputy Dean of Academic Affairs Ding Haochuan emphasized to everyone in the report a few issues that should be paid attention to during the discussion: 1. The relationship between the people's culture and education and the people's political struggle. 2. The difference between the "Wu Xun spirit" and the spirit of serving the people. 3. Whether the free schools run by Wu Xun were the schools needed by the working people at the time? Can the judgment of a person be made by separating the motive from the effect? The student union also determined that from June 1 to 4, documents should be read, and on the 5th and 6th, each class should conduct informal discussions to discover problems, and then analyze the roots of their own erroneous thoughts and criticize them. According to the students' specific ideological situation, the student union strives to invite someone to make a report on the 10th. In addition, the normal university trade union also launched a discussion on the film "The Life of Wu Xun," and professors from Chinese, history and other departments conducted discussions with students from their respective departments.

    In short, through this discussion, we must thoroughly clarify the confused thoughts on this issue; and thereby establish correct educational views, so that everyone can become a truly excellent people's teacher in the future.

　　The Erroneous Annotation of Wu Xun in the "New Terminology Dictionary" Should Be Revised To the Editors:
    The "New Terminology Dictionary" (Revised Edition) published by Shanghai Chunming Bookstore and edited by Hu Jitao lists Wu Xun in the "Scholars, Experts, and Celebrities" section of the "People" category. The annotation says that Wu Xun "was a righteous person who established schools," "deeply felt the importance of knowledge, so he dedicated his life to establishing schools by begging, and was indeed an unprecedented remarkable person." And the free schools he ran "achieved remarkable results." This shows that the editor of the dictionary has an erroneous understanding of Wu Xun. We believe that this erroneous annotation should be revised.

　　对于电影《武训传》的讨论有些同志重视不够
    自由态度应即改变
    （一）编辑同志：
    自从人民日报连续发表了批判《武训传》的文章后，我们机关里议论纷纷，出现了三种不同的思想情况和对此问题的三种看法和态度。
    第一种，他们对电影《武训传》的讨论非常重视，对批判《武训传》的文章，都认真地阅读，并且以其中的正确观点，来批判自己过去对武训的错误认识及其思想根源。大家对武训都有了正确的认识，并向不关心这问题或对武训认识不清的同志们进行宣传解释。这一种人只占少数。
    第二种，他们对电影《武训传》的讨论漠不关心，有的只是把关于讨论《武训传》的文章好奇地看一看。有的听了别人对此问题的争论，不加可否，不表示任何态度，好象这问题与自己无关紧要，学习不学习没有关系。这一种人是多数。
    第三种，对《武训传》错误认识，思想很混乱。如所谓“对武训的要求不能太苛”，“武训苦行兴学的精神总还是好的”等等。
    我们机关内的大部分工作人员，对讨论电影《武训传》这一原则性的思想斗争，竟是这样麻木淡漠，实在是一个很严重的问题。五月二十日人民日报社论已经明确指出应该重视电影《武训传》的讨论。但据我了解，有些机关，在这个问题上，也存在着和我们机关类似情况。因此，我建议：各机关学习委员会应该重视这个问题的学习，有计划地领导这个学习，以使大家在思想上、认识上取得一致，并在这个学习中提高大家的政治理论水平。
                                        中央私营企业局  赵国维
     （二）编辑同志：
    自从报纸上连续刊登了许多讨论电影《武训传》的文章后，很多机关团体也开始展开了学习和讨论。但是，有一些同志对这个讨论的意义认识不足，因而就不很关心。有很多次，我发现有的同志看到旁人在学习报纸上讨论《武训传》的文章时，认为对自己没多大关系，就漠不关心地走了。有的同志虽然也参加讨论，但在讨论时，仅在口头上讲一大套“武训生于一八三八年，当时外国资本主义侵入中国……”而不联系自己思想来谈。
    我觉得这些情况都是对我们有害的。因此，我建议各机关、部队、团体的同志们，更深入地进行电影《武训传》讨论。

　　我产生崇拜武训的错误思想的根源在那里？编辑同志：
    我过去思想上中毒太深，一直敬佩武训。尤其看了电影《武训传》后，毒上加毒，使我对武训的崇拜更加强了。
    直到读了五月二十日人民日报社论“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”及“共产党员应当参加关于《武训传》的批判”的文章，我才开始认识到我过去崇拜武训是一个严重的错误。
    为什么会产生这种原则性的严重思想错误呢？
    首先，这是和我的家庭出身（地主家庭）及长时期所受的封建阶级的教育和国民党反动统治阶级的教育分不开的。从六岁起，我就在祖父主持的私塾里受着封建剥削阶级的思想教育。私塾里教学的内容，和武训所办的“义学”里完全一样，就是“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”、“万般皆下品、惟有读书高”及“忠君爱国”等一套。我自己当时是完全接受这种说法的。到了小学、中学时，我的家庭已经开始没落了；但父亲在家庭经济困难的情况下还要让我去“深造”。原因很简单：大学毕业后，可以“升官发财”，“荣宗耀祖”。这种“升官发财”的剥削阶级反动教育对我的影响，是形成我的严重错误的基本原因。
    其次，是我学习中教条主义的学习方法和缺乏实事求是的学习态度。例如，我学习社会发展史前后已三次了，自己认为收获不小，已学会了从发展观点看问题的道理；并且认为再学也没有多大意思了。但事实证明，当一接触具体问题（例如武训和电影“武训传”）时，我就犯了错误。这说明我学习中脱离实际的教条主义学习方法，和“好高骛远”的学习态度严重地阻碍了我的进步和政治的提高。
    我对中国历史知识的贫乏及遇事不详加调查研究即轻率地乱下判断和结论的恶劣作风，也是形成对武训及“武训传”认识错误的原因之一。
    经过对电影“武训传”的讨论，我认识了犯错误的原因。今后，我决心要彻底批判过去的错误学习方法与学习态度，认真学习马克思主义和毛泽东思想，并以马克思主义和毛泽东思想作为武器，来提高自己的觉悟，锻炼自己的思想战斗能力。
                        读者  吴刚
　　用马克思主义的武器来戮穿武训之类的真面目编辑同志：
    我是个历史教师。在学了《社会发展史》和《历史唯物论与辩证唯物论》后，自以为明确了不少问题。但是在读了杨耳等同志关于武训和“武训传”的文章后，我才大吃一惊，猛省到我的学习还差得很，只是辩证法唯物论条文的一知半解，一碰到具体问题就糊涂了。尤其当大家都说“武训好”，甚至打起“劳动人民文化翻身的旗帜”来歌颂他的时候，我就更糊涂了。我把“为了在政治上不犯错误，便要向前看，而不要向后看”，“便要做革命家，而不要做改良主义者”的历史名言（联共党史第四章第二节语）忘了；我把衡量历史人物应看他对历史发展有无推动作用的原则忘了。我完全被武训的“奇行隗节”迷惑了。
    我是教历史课的，在讲历代统治者愚弄人民的文化政策时，我总是尽力揭穿它的本质在使“天下英雄入吾彀中矣”。但是对武训积极帮统治者培养奴才的事实，我却相信是“义学”，是“牺牲自己，为人民服务”！
    中国历史上的农民典型如李自成等的英雄气概是多么动人心魄！而武训的卑躬屈节又是多么令人作呕！但是我却人云亦云地把他也奉为中国农民的典型，甚至还想教我的学生学习他的“专业精神”。
    记得一九四八年在华北联合大学学习的时候，校长成仿吾同志教导我们要“自由思考”。他说：我敢保证你们谁也不敢说能“自由思考”了。因为你们考虑问题时，往往有孔夫子、胡适之流在支配你们的脑子，所以你们要能“自由思考”，就必须努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想（大意）。今天对照了过去对武训的看法，再细细回味这几句话，才更觉得格外发人深省！

　　通过对电影“武训传”的讨论  我们要树立正确的教育观点编辑同志：
    师范大学有许多同学看过电影“武训传”后，他们正和很多人一样，被这个含有毒素的片子所迷蒙，有些同学逢人就说武训怎么“伟大”。当杨耳等同志批判武训的文章发表后，同学们虽觉得这些文章颇有道理，却不能因此否定了武训。直到人民日报发表社论“应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论”后，学生会才开始重视这个问题。根据学生会了解同学们的一些思想情况：有人认为武训虽无功劳，至少有“苦劳”；有人认为“武训出生于清末，受当时历史条件限制”。以现在的标准要求他“岂非太苛刻”；有人认为武训虽替封建统治阶级服务，但究竟“也办了义学”，“提高了劳动人民的文化”……。这一切说明我们同学思想是相当混乱的。我们师范大学的同学正在准备着为人民教育服务，如果不能明确地认识教育应当与当前政治斗争相密切结合，并要为政治服务，如果不彻底批判单纯教育观点和机械历史观点，将产生如何严重的后果！因此展开《武训传》的讨论在我们师范大学非常必要的。
    于是，学生会首先通过广播，介绍《中国青年报》社论“青年们应当参加关于《武训传》的讨论”，号召同学热烈展开讨论，并周密地订出学习计划。五月三十日，学生会召开各班学习股长会议，明确提出对电影“武训传”的讨论是一次原则性的思想斗争。因此，应当发动同学，认真检查自己的思想，发现问题。五月三十一日晚上，由丁浩川副教务长作启发报告。丁浩川副教务长报告中向大家强调指出了讨论时应该注意的几个问题：一、人民的文化教育与人民政治斗争的关系。二、“武训精神”和为人民服务的精神的不同。三、武训所办的义学是否为当时劳动人民所需要的学校？判断一个人物是否可以把动机和效果分裂开来看？学生会并确定六月一日至四日阅读文件，五、六两日各班分别进行漫谈，以发现问题，进而分析自己的错误思想根源，并加以批判。根据同学们的具体思想情况，学生会争取在十日请人作一次报告。此外，师范大学工会也展开了电影“武训传”的讨论，中文、历史等系教授都与本系同学共同进行讨论。
    总之，通过这次讨论，我们一定要彻底澄清对这个问题的混乱思想；并由此树立正确的教育观点，使每一个人将来都能做一个真正优良的人民教师。

　　应修正《新名词辞典》中对武训的错误注释编辑同志：
    上海春明书店出版、胡济涛主编的《新名词辞典》（增订本），把武训列在人物之部的“学者专家闻人”栏中。其注释中说，武训“是个兴学的义士”，“深感知识之重要，故终身立志，以行乞兴学，实为空前未有的奇人。”及所办义学“成绩斐然”。这说明该辞典的主编者对武训的认识是错误的。我们认为该项错误注释应当予以修正。
