Do a Good Job in Increasing Production, Donation, and Giving Preferential Treatment to Military Dependents, Turning Patriotic Pledges into Concrete Actions

——A Letter from the Liangguan Township Branch of the CCP in Lushan, Henan

Chairman Mao:

Our township branch, in order to welcome the Party's birthday and ensure that the entire branch plays its due role in the great movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, and respond to the three major appeals of the China Peace Committee, plans to do the following specific work:

1.  Increase production and donate aircraft and artillery: After our branch heard this call, everyone was so happy they almost jumped up. For example, branch committee member Zhang Shutang said: "This work of increasing production and donating is really in line with my wishes! As long as we donate more aircraft and artillery like this and send them to the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, it will be so satisfying to eliminate the American devils! In addition to farming well to increase production, I will work hard to sell vegetables and earn money to donate, and I will also do more publicity to motivate the masses." After everyone discussed it at the branch meeting, they immediately made arrangements for the propagandists, deciding to launch a movement to increase production and donate, using the publicity network, loudspeakers, and blackboards to widely and deeply explain it to the masses. After a long period of education on resisting America and aiding Korea, especially after participating in the "May Day" parade and demonstration, everyone's awareness has been greatly raised. Therefore, as soon as they heard the news of this increase in production and donation, the masses were as excited as firewood catching fire. Everyone unanimously supported this glorious patriotic movement. Liu Tingdong, the secretary of the township branch, will report that he will donate 100,000 yuan by farming well and picking up more manure. Labor model Yan Lao Si (a Party member) said: "I will grow good tobacco and take time to go to the market to sell vegetables and fruits, donating money worth one dou of wheat and twenty jin of tobacco." This motivated the masses to generally formulate donation and production increase plans. Women generally made donation plans to spin more cotton and make more shoes. Our entire township will complete the glorious patriotic duty of increasing production and donating 15 million yuan.

2.  Check Patriotic Pledges: After receiving patriotic education to resist America this spring, every household in our township has generally made patriotic pledges. Since making the pledges, all kinds of work have been renewed, and the enthusiasm for production competition has been very high, setting off a fertilizer accumulation movement. The entire township dug out 25,000 carts of green mud in five days. This summer, more than 70,000 jin of improved wheat varieties were selected, and rapid harvesting, threshing, and planting were achieved. In order to regularize the movement to resist America and aid Korea in the future and make it an engine for various tasks, our township established a committee to check patriotic pledges, which regularly checks to continuously promote the work of resisting America and aiding Korea. We must also carry out a model selection movement, selecting the model figures in our township's movement to resist America and aid Korea and letting everyone learn from them. Especially in this donation, the masses generally added and supplemented pledges to increase production, and most of the masses have replaced the original patriotic pledges written on paper with wooden plaques or red cloth to prevent damage.

3.  Do a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers: Conduct education among the masses on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, and earnestly solve all the difficulties of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers. The preferential treatment committee should regularly visit the families of martyrs and soldiers to check the work of farming on their behalf, contracting farming, and allocating labor; and send gifts and condolences on various festivals. We will also mobilize the masses to write letters of condolences, make comfort bags and other comfort items, and send them to the volunteers on the Korean front, so that they can use the weapons we have increased production and donated to defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible.

          Respectfully,
              The entire membership of the Liangguan Township Branch of the CCP in the Ninth District of Lushan

    作好增产捐献优待军属工作把爱国公约变成具体的行动
    ——中共河南鲁山梁官乡支部的信毛主席：
    俺乡支部为了迎接党的生日，保证在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，响应抗美援朝总会的三大号召，起到全支部应起的作用。俺打算做的具体工作如下：
    一、增产捐献飞机大炮：俺支部听到这个号召后，大家都高兴几乎跳起来。如支部委员张书堂说：“这个增产捐献工作真是合我心意极了！只要这样多多捐出飞机大炮，送给朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军，消灭美国鬼子就痛快咧！我除种好地增产外，要加油卖菜赚钱捐出，还要多作宣传，带动群众。”支部会上大家研究后，马上给宣传员作了布置，决定要掀起增产捐献运动，利用宣传网、广播筒、黑板报，广泛深入地宣传解释给群众听。俺乡经过长期抗美援朝的教育，特别是参加“五一”游行示威后，大家觉悟更提高了。所以一听到这个增产捐献消息，群众如火燃穰柴一样轰的一声兴奋起来。大家一致拥护这个光荣爱国运动。乡支部书记刘廷栋，要以种好地多拾粪自报捐出拾万元。劳动模范阎老四（党员）说：“我要种好烟叶，抽空赶集卖菜、卖水果，捐出值麦子一斗、烟叶二十斤的钱。”这样带动群众，普遍地订出了捐献的增产计划。妇女普遍订立多纺花多做鞋的捐献计划。俺全乡要完成增产捐献一千五百万元的光荣爱国义务。
    二、检查爱国公约：俺全乡今春受到了抗美爱国教育后，家家户户普遍地都订了爱国公约。自订约后，各种工作焕然一新，生产竞赛情绪非常高涨，掀起了积肥运动。全乡五天时间挖出青泥两万五千车。今夏选了麦子良种七万余斤，并实现了快收快打快种。俺乡为了将今后抗美援朝运动经常化，成为各种工作的发动机，成立一个检查爱国公约委员会，定期检查，来不断地推动抗美援朝工作。并要开展评选模范运动，将俺乡抗美援朝运动中的模范人物，评选出来，让大家向他们学习。尤其是在这次捐献中，群众普遍地增订补充增产的公约，并有大部群众已将原来写在纸上的爱国公约换写在木牌上或红布上，防止损坏。
    三、作好优待烈属、军属工作：在群众中进行拥军优属的教育，切实解决烈军工属一切困难，优军委员会要经常访问烈属军属，检查代耕、包耕、拨工工作；并遇各种节日送礼慰问。我们还要发动群众写慰问信，做慰问袋及其他慰问物品，送给朝鲜前线的志愿军，让他们用着我们增产捐献的武器来早日打败美国侵略军。
          此致布礼
              中共鲁山九区梁官乡支部全体党员
