    Use Your Brains to Increase Production, Donate Airplanes, Tanks, and Artillery!
            Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Repair Department Formulates Three Measures for Increasing Production and Donation.
    To the Editor:
    Recently, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued a call to donate airplanes and artillery. We also listened to the moving stories of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's heroic battles and the Korean people's staunch resilience from the representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, as well as the brutal crimes of US imperialism in Korea. All ninety-two workers in the welding shop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Repair Department are determined to support the Korean War with practical actions, further deepen the patriotic production increase movement, and donate all increased income to buy airplanes and artillery.
    We have decided on the following three ways to increase production and donate:
    (1) In order to expedite the iron output of two small iron smelting furnaces and increase national construction and defense strength, all our workers have decided to work overtime for two hours every day, without affecting cultural studies, and eight hours on Sundays, to complete two slag ladles and a dust collector in a concentrated effort. All income from this work will be donated.
    (2) We will contract for twenty material car hoppers and some miscellaneous work, and, without affecting other work, extract some manpower to complete this work in a concentrated effort. All bonuses from this work will be donated.
    (3) Half of the summer over-task bonus will be donated.

            Xizhimen Station Dispatch Room Uses Spare Time for Production and Donation
    To the Editor:
    We, the thirty-two workers in the Xizhimen Station dispatch room, are already responding to the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea's call to donate airplanes and artillery by using our spare time for voluntary unloading labor.
    After the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued the call, the reading group in the dispatch room told everyone the news. When the workers heard that the Volunteer Army needed more airplanes and artillery, they were all determined to donate. Comrade Cheng Yugang suggested that since transportation has been busy recently, many freight cars have arrived at Xizhimen, and the station's loading and unloading capacity is insufficient, we should use our spare time to unload cars for donation. This suggestion was immediately supported by everyone.
    On June 3rd, we started unloading cars. In order to earn more money to buy airplanes and artillery to support the Volunteer Army, we chose difficult-to-unload but high-freight-fee goods, such as bricks and tiles. We put forward the slogans "Unloading one more brick or tile is equivalent to eliminating one more aggressor" and "The more we sweat, the less blood the soldiers shed on the front lines." Everyone's morale is high. While singing songs of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, we unload goods. Although we work for two hours every day in addition to our busy work, no one feels tired.
    As of June 8th, we have unloaded 150 tons of goods. We have decided to unload 30 to 40 tons every day, and use the income to buy airplanes and artillery.

            Many Employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Want to Donate Overtime Pay and Bonuses
    To the Editor:
    In order to respond to the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea's call to launch a movement to donate airplanes and artillery, employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau are using their brains to find ways to increase production.
    The workers in the supply department warehouse decided to work overtime on June 10th, using scrap materials to make carding pins, and donate all of their wages for that day. They also launched a "Salvage Scrap Movement" in the South Bureau, placing several large wooden boxes at the gate of the South Bureau, calling on everyone to pick up scrap materials when they see them and put them in the boxes; now there are many scraps in the wooden boxes.
    The Yu Dehai team of the West Chang'an Street Business Office decided that in the future, the delivery rate of telegrams must reach 100% in advance (delivering telegrams before the time specified by the Bureau), and donate all the bonus for telegram delivery performance. In addition, the line service team guarantees to save raw materials and reduce obstacles during the rainy season; Liang Qinghua and other three teams from the Second Bureau and Tian Shuhui team from the Third Bureau decided to donate all overtime pay each month.

        Beijing Industrial School Uses School Equipment for Production and Donation
    To the Editor:
    Since the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea issued a call to launch a movement to donate airplanes and artillery, all students in our school immediately held heated discussions to study how to carry out this work. Everyone unanimously agreed that the movement to donate airplanes and artillery is a regular task, and decided to use all the school's production equipment for production, without affecting learning and health, and donate the income to buy airplanes and artillery.
    Second-year students in the Chemistry Department sold their unused items for money and planned to use this money to buy old cotton; then use sodium hydroxide and soapy water to make absorbent cotton from the old cotton, sell it, and donate the proceeds. Because sodium hydroxide is very expensive, they make sodium hydroxide themselves from lime and alkali powder; and collect coal nuclei from the school's coal ash pile as fuel to reduce costs.
    Students in the Civil Engineering Department plan to organize surveying teams to carry out surveying and mapping work, and donate the rewards they receive.
    Students in the Mechanical Engineering Department use the school's mechanical factory to do outside work in their spare time; and organize students to make drawings, donating all the income they receive.
    When the Student Union announced the acceptance of donations, all teachers and students enthusiastically donated. Lin Qingxiang, a student from the Chemistry Department (overseas Chinese), donated two gold rings, a gold medal, 250,000 RMB, and two bottles of medicine. The school's communications team decided to write more articles in the future and donate all the proceeds from each month's articles until the US invading army is driven out of Korea!
                                    Beijing Industrial School Communications Team
            Agricultural University Teachers and Students Produce Agricultural Medicines for Donation
    To the Editor:
    The teachers, students, and staff of our Beijing Agricultural University have responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea by proposing various ways to engage in amateur production and donate the income to buy airplanes and artillery.
    In addition to donating 1 million RMB of previous income, the Agricultural Chemistry Department's Medicine Manufacturing Room has formulated a plan to organize teachers, students, and staff of the department to expand production and continue to manufacture plant growth hormones, oxidants, cottonseed oil emulsion, organic mercury agents, and E605, and to trial-produce soil quick-test devices for supply to rural areas, farms, orchards, greenhouses, and research institutions across the country. They have decided to donate 50% of the surplus to the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to purchase weapons. This action supports the Volunteer Army on the one hand, and contributes to striving for self-sufficiency in chemical medicines and shattering the shameless behavior of US imperialism's economic blockade against us on the other hand.
    The faculty and students of the Entomology Department are preparing to manufacture specimens of the life history of pests for teaching in universities and middle schools, and will donate the surplus they earn. This method is closely integrated with business learning.
    The Animal Husbandry Department plans to engage in production such as raising rabbits and processing animal products. Chen Futian and Lei Shaobo, two students from the department, have donated their ducks and rabbits as production funds.
    Other departments are also enthusiastically discussing and proposing various production methods to implement the article "Support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army" in the patriotic pact.
    In addition, Zhu Changgong and Zhu Junzhen have donated their gold rings. Four female employees take apart and wash quilts for others and donate the income. There are also many students who are willing to do translation, surveying, and other work in their spare time to increase income and donate to the Volunteer Army heroes.

            All Employees of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau Join the Donation Movement
    To the Editor:
    Employees of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Land Administration Bureau responded to the call of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and enthusiastically launched a patriotic movement to increase production and donation. Everyone wrote pledges to guarantee the completion of work plans in advance and to carry out amateur production and save salaries to donate airplanes and artillery.
    The Bureau's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea convened a meeting of all employees on June 7 to discuss the donation issue. More than 170 employees submitted pledges on the spot, expressing their intention to step up work, complete work plans in advance, and use their spare time to carry out production, with all income donated to purchase airplanes and artillery. The pledge of the Wu Yuqing mutual aid group of the Surveying Section guaranteed to complete the work plan for May and June one week in advance and to improve the quality of work. Comrade Meng Fanzeng expressed his intention to complete the plan of surveying and mapping 7,000 rooms two weeks ahead of schedule in May and June and to strive to exceed the quota by 1,500 rooms. He also decided to save 20 kilograms of millet every month to support the front line until victory. Seventeen comrades in the Registration Section donated more than 400 kilograms of millet on the spot and will strengthen their work and donate on a monthly basis in the future to respond to the call of "The more sweat shed in the rear, the less blood shed on the front line." Women comrades also plan to do handicrafts for various factories in their spare time, with all income used to support the front line.
    The staff and traders of the Real Estate Exchange almost all proposed to work as usual on Sundays. This will not only increase income and donate airplanes and artillery, but also help more citizens, especially public educators, buy, sell, and rent houses.

            China National Grain Corporation, Heilongjiang Provincial Company
　　　  Lack of Precise Planning and Inspection in Work Leads to Losses of State Property
    To the Editor:
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Corporation, the superior grain company of our Hailun County in Heilongjiang Province, lacks planning in its work, which has caused losses to state property and brought many difficulties to our work. We hope they will improve their work.
    Our two oil factories in Hailun County process a large number of soybean oil for the country every year. Last year, we were forced to shut down for a month because the superior company lacked precise planning and did not allocate enough oil containers. In March this year, we shut down again for 29 days for the same reason, producing 2,349 tons less oil. In early March, the Provincial Grain Corporation sent us five large oil tanks (each can hold 12 tons of oil). After our test, the rivets all leaked. If we were to force oil into them, there would be a risk of cracking. The reason is that the iron sheets they used were all 3.3 cm white iron sheets, which were too thin. It is said that the Provincial Grain Corporation made more than 40 such oil tanks, totaling about 600 million RMB. If these tanks cannot be used, that is a huge waste. We asked the Provincial Grain Corporation, and they said that the Northeast District Company wanted them to make them.
    We were forced to stop work because of the oil container problem. But in mid-March, the Provincial Company suddenly sent us 20 train cars of oil drums. After loading all of our oil reserves for two and a half months, the oil drums were still enough for 45 days of maximum production. Our production work is sometimes completely stopped and sometimes needs to be rushed, which is completely passive. This is entirely due to the lack of planning in the work style of the superior company. I think the superior company should pay more attention to this in the future.
                   Chen Daosheng, Second Oil Factory, Hailun County Grain Corporation, Heilongjiang Province
    Editor's Note: Comrade Chen Daosheng's letter was written in March. We immediately inquired with the China National Grain Corporation's Heilongjiang Provincial Company based on this information. The company's Storage and Transportation Section has now written a self-criticism, expressing their acceptance of this criticism and improvement of their work. They have dispatched technicians to conduct practical tests on the question of how to use the finished oil tanks. The lesson that the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Corporation increased the difficulties of the subordinate companies because of its own lack of planning deserves attention from all localities. Therefore, we are still publishing this letter.

    开动脑筋增加生产，捐献飞机坦克大炮！
            石景山钢铁厂修理部订出增产捐献三项办法编辑同志：
    最近中国人民抗美援朝总会发出了捐献飞机和大炮的号召，我们又听了中国人民赴朝慰问团代表报告中国人民志愿军英勇作战、朝鲜人民坚强不屈的动人事迹，以及美帝国主义在朝鲜残暴罪行。我们石景山钢铁厂修理部焊场全体九十二个工人，都决心以实际行动来支援朝鲜战争，更深入地展开爱国增产运动，并将增加的收入全部捐献买飞机大炮。
    我们已决定的增加生产捐献的方式共有三种：
    （一）为了使两个小熔铁炉早日出铁，增加国家建设及国防力量，我们全体工人决定每日在不影响文化学习条件下，业余劳动两小时；星期日业余劳动八小时，把两个流料斗手及一个除尘器突击完成。并把此项工作所有收入全部捐献。
    （二）把二十个料车斗子及些零星工作全部包下，在不影响其他工作原则下，抽出一部分人力，把这项工作突击完成。并把该项工作全部红利捐献。
    （三）将夏季超任务奖金的一半捐献出来。

            西直门车站派班室利用业余时间生产捐献编辑同志：
    我们西直门车站派班室三十二个工友已经用业余卸车的义务劳动来响应中国人民抗美援朝总会捐献飞机大炮的号召。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会发出号召后，派班室读报组就向大家讲了这个新闻。工友们一听说志愿军需要更多的飞机大炮，都决心捐献。程玉岗同志提出近来运输繁忙，西直门到达货车很多，车站装卸力感到不足，建议利用业余时间卸车捐献。这个建议立刻得到大家的拥护。
    六月三日，我们开始了卸车工作。我们为了争取捐献更多的钱购买飞机大炮支援志愿军，就选择了难卸而卸货费高的货物，如砖、瓦等。我们提出了“多卸一块砖瓦、就等于多消灭一个侵略者”，“我们多出汗，前方战士少流血”的口号。大家情绪很高，一面唱着抗美援朝的歌子，一面卸货，虽然每天在繁忙的工作之余，以两小时来进行生产，但谁也不觉得累。
    到六月八日为止，我们已经卸了一百五十吨货，我们决定每天要卸三十吨到四十吨，以所得收入购买飞机大炮。

            北京电信局许多职工要捐献加班费和奖金编辑同志：
    北京电信局职工为了响应中国人民抗美援朝总会关于开展捐献飞机大炮运动的号召，都开动脑筋想办法增加生产。
    供应科仓库的工友们决定在六月十日加班一天，利用废料做卡钉，将这一天的工资全部捐献出来。他们并在南局发起了一个“检废品运动”，在南局大门口放了几个大木箱，号召大家看见废品就检起来放在箱里；现在木箱里废品已经很多。
    西长安街营业处于德海小组决定以后每月送报要达到百分之百的提前送到（在局方规定的送报时间之前把电报送到），把送报成绩奖金全部捐献。此外，线务小组保证要节约原料、减少雨季障碍；二局梁庆华等三个小组及三局田书慧小组决定捐献每月所有加班费。

        北京工业学校利用学校设备生产捐献编辑同志：
    自中国人民抗美援朝总会发出关于开展捐献飞机大炮运动的号召后，我们全校各科级同学立即进行了热烈的讨论，研究如何展开这一工作。大家一致认为捐献飞机大炮运动是个经常性的工作，决定在不影响学习和健康的原则下，利用本校所有生产设备进行生产，将所得之收入捐献飞机大炮。
    化学科二年级同学把自己不用的东西卖掉换成钱，计划将此款购买旧棉花；然后用氢氧化钠和肥皂水将旧棉花制成药棉，出卖捐献。因为氢氧化纳价钱很贵，所以他们用石灰和碱末自制氢氧化钠；并在本校煤灰堆中检煤核为燃料，以降低成本。
    土木科同学计划组织测量队，进行测量、制图工作，将所得的报酬捐献出来。
    机械科同学利用校内的机械工厂，在课余时间做外活；并组织同学制图，将所得之全部收入捐献。
    当学生会发表收受捐款后，全校师生就热烈捐献。化学科林清香同学（华侨）捐献了两个金戒指，一个金牌子，二十五万人民币及两瓶药品。本校通讯组决定以后多多写稿，将每月所得之稿费全部捐献，直到把美国侵略军队赶出朝鲜为止！
                                    北京市工业学校通讯组
            农业大学师生生产农业药品进行捐献编辑同志：
    我们北京农业大学的师生员工纷纷响应抗美援朝总会号召，提出各种办法进行业余生产，把收入捐献飞机大炮。
    农业化学系药品制造室除将以前的收入捐献一百万元外，并订出计划，组织本系师生员工扩大生产，继续制造植物生长素、氧化剂、棉油乳剂、有机汞剂、Ｅ六零五五种药品、及试制土壤速测器，供给各地农村、农场、果园、花房、研究机关使用。他们决定将盈余百分之五十捐献给中国人民志愿军英雄们购制武器。这种行动，一方面支援了志愿军，一方面也为争取化学药品的自给，粉碎美帝国主义对我经济封锁的无耻行为尽了一分力量。
    昆虫系教职员及同学已准备制造害虫生活史标本，供给大中学校教学之用，将所得盈余捐献。这个办法是与业务学习密切相结合的。
    畜牧系计划进行养兔子和畜产品加工等生产。该系陈福田、镭少伯两同学已捐出所养鸭子和兔子作为生产基金。
    其他各系也正在热烈讨论，提出各种生产办法来实现爱国公约中“支援中国人民志愿军”的条文。
    此外朱畅功、朱钧真两同学已捐献了他们的金戒指。四位女职员代人拆洗被褥，将收入捐献出来。还有许许多多同学都愿意在业余进行翻译、测量等工作来增加收入，捐献给志愿军英雄们。
                                        北京农业大学通讯组
            北京市人民政府地政局全体职工卷入捐献运动编辑同志：
    北京市人民政府地政局职工响应中国人民抗美援朝总会号召，热烈地展开了爱国增加生产捐献运动。大家纷纷写决心书，保证提前完成工作计划，并进行业余生产，节约薪资等办法，捐献飞机大炮。
    该局抗美援朝委员会在六月七日召开全体职工会议讨论捐献问题。当场就有一百七十多个职工递上决心书，表示要加紧工作，提前完成工作计划，并利用业余时间进行生产，所得收入全部捐献购买飞机大炮。测量科吴聿清互助小组的决心书上保证提前一周完成五、六月份工作计划，并保证提高工作质量。孟范曾同志表示提前两周完成五、六月份测图七千间的计划，并争取超额一千五百间。他还决定每月节省二十斤小米支援前线，直到胜利为止。登记科十七位同志当场捐出四百余斤小米，以后还要加强工作、按月捐献，来响应“后方多流一滴汗，前方少流一滴血”的号召。妇女同志们也计划在工余代各工厂做手工活，以收入全部支援前线。
    房地产交易所的工作人员和交易员几乎都提出星期天要照常办公。这样不仅可以增加收入，捐献飞机大炮；并且可以更多地帮助市民、特别是公教人员买卖和租赁房屋。

            中国粮食公司黑龙江省公司
　　　  工作缺乏精密计划检查　　使国家财产遭受了损失编辑同志：
    我们黑龙江省海伦县的上级粮食公司——黑龙江省粮食公司工作缺乏计划性，使国家财产遭受损失，并给我们的工作带来了不少困难。希望他们改进自己的工作。
    我们海伦县的两个制油厂，每年为国家加工大批豆油。去年，我们曾因上级公司缺乏精密计划，没有拨来足够的盛油器，被迫停工一个月。今年三月，又因同样原因停工二十九天，少出油二千三百四十九吨。三月上旬省粮食公司给我们发来五个（每个可盛十二吨油）大油罐子。经我们试验，铆钉处全漏水。如果勉强装油，还有崩裂的危险。原因是他们用的铁皮都是三糎三的白铁片，太薄了。据说，省粮食公司共做了四十多个这样的油罐子，总计约值六亿元人民币。如果这些罐子都不能用，那真是一笔巨大的浪费。我们问省粮食公司，他们说这是东北区公司要他们做的。
    我们因为盛油器问题被迫停了工。但三月中旬省公司突然给我们发来二十列车的油桶。把两个半月的全部存油装走后，油桶还够四十五天的最高产量之用。我们的生产工作有时全部停顿，有时又需加紧赶，陷于完全被动。这完全是由于上级公司缺乏计划性的工作作风造成的。我认为上级公司在今后应多加注意。
                   黑龙江省海伦县粮食公司第二制油厂  陈道生
    编者按：陈道生同志的信是三月间写来的，我们当时即据此情况询问中国粮食公司黑龙江省公司，该公司储运科现已来信检讨，表示接受这一批评，改进自己的工作。已制好的油罐应如何运用的问题，他们已派出技师作实际试验。黑龙江省粮食公司因为本身工作缺乏计划而增加了下级公司的困难的教训，值得各地注意。所以我们仍把这封信发表。
