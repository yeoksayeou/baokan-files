Following the successive discoveries in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Ganzhou, Chongqing, and other places of incidents of imperialist elements abusing and killing Chinese children under the guise of "charity," Wuhan City has also uncovered the towering crime of American imperialism's abuse and killing of Chinese children.

In 1928, American imperialist elements opened a killing field in Garden Mountain, Wuchang - the Catholic Church "Orphanage". Over the past 23 years, the church has abused and killed 16,000 Chinese children. The corpses of the infants were buried on the hillside behind the church. The excavated fragments of bones, such as hands, feet, and skullcaps, have already filled several large coffins.

The founder of the Wuchang Garden Mountain Orphanage was the American Bishop Arendt, the original bishop of the Catholic Wuchang Diocese. In 1946, American imperialist elements Guo Shiji and Xu Laide, the bishop and deputy bishop of the Catholic Wuchang Diocese, inherited this bloody undertaking. The specific work in the church was the responsibility of five American nuns, including Ke Aide. On the eve of the liberation of Wuhan, these five American nuns fled back to their country in a sorry state, handing over the work in the church to eighteen Chinese nuns, including Gao Zhuangying. These people were directed by Guo Shiji and Xu Laide. Why did the American imperialists cling to the "Orphanage"? From the reports that Guo Shiji and Xu Laide sent to the American church, we learned that they were planning to use the so-called "Orphanage" and "Orphan Home" to realize the conspiracy of massively slaughtering our future generations. The report stated: "The purpose of the orphanage is to 'save souls'. Since the salvation began in 1924, many souls have ascended to heaven every day." "This work is a source of joy and comfort for us." In Guo and Xu's "saving souls" work, the infant mortality rate was truly appalling. According to a worker who personally dug ditches and buried corpses, the ditches he dug were five or six feet long and two feet wide and deep. He buried the corpses in ditch after ditch, "filling a ditch every ten days." The talks of many nuns and workers have proved that the church used to take in an average of two to four infants every day. If we calculate based on receiving 700 infants every year, then more than 16,000 people were received in 23 years. Now there are only 105 infants, orphaned girls, and young people who have luckily grown up in the church. This means that the infant mortality rate is over 99 percent! The high infant mortality rate can also be proved from another material sent by the church to the United States: "From 1920 to 1940, 40,000 souls from Huangshigang and Garden Mountain went to heaven."

The murderers' methods were extremely cruel and barbaric. The orphanage occupied 9,672 square feet in Garden Mountain, but the place for "nurturing infants" was only two rooms the size of a monk's cell. After the infants were taken in, they were squeezed together with other tortured and sick children. The whole room smelled terrible. No one cared about the infants' urine and feces, and their armpits and buttocks were mostly red and festering. The feces formed dry lumps on their backs, and finally, the skin and flesh were peeled off. Pneumonia, gastroenteritis, trachoma, sores, and other terrible infectious diseases were distributed on every infant. The children became thin, festered, some could not walk or speak at the age of three, and some weighed only three pounds... Then, they were abandoned in a dark basement, where rats were allowed to bite their eyes and noses. After the infants died, they were buried in rows and layers in the ditches on the back hillside.

While the American murderers slaughtered infants, they also tried to raise a few infants and force them to do unpaid labor. The children had to work before they were ten years old, working sixteen hours a day! The inhumane Xu Laide swallowed all the income of more than 8 million yuan that the children earned from laundry work outside the church from January last year to April this year. The children suffered the cruel devastation of the American priests. Among the more than fifty orphaned girls who have luckily survived, seven are idiots, three have scabies, three have pockmarks, and three suffer from mental illness. One child, six or seven years old, does not have a single tooth. The American murderers strangled their thoughts. They do not know that they have a motherland, they only know "the grace of the Americans." The American nuns told them: "To be a dutiful person, you can ascend to heaven after death." Those who did not abide by their "duty" or were not at their disposal were beaten or forced to marry outsiders at the murderers' will. The American nuns strictly divided them into five levels: orphans, aspirants, novices, postulants, and nuns. They could not speak to each other or interact with each other. Furthermore, they were not allowed to tell outsiders about the affairs in the church. The murderers also forbade outsiders from visiting.

The bloody sins of the beasts were finally discovered by the people of Wuhan. Liu Cuiying, who had worked as a nun in the church, first exposed this fact in the newspaper. The Wuhan Relief Branch and the Democratic Women's Federation and other units investigated the church in April this year, explored the location where the infants' corpses were buried, and began excavation work. The personnel who went to work were resisted and sabotaged by the American imperialist elements. They used the religious rituals of evening confession to paralyze, intimidate, and threaten the awakened orphaned girls and nuns, and at the same time used some lackeys to spread rumors everywhere. But in the face of piles of bones, the American imperialist elements cannot deny it!

The accusation meeting held by 84,000 people in Wuchang on May 26 was the concentrated outbreak of the masses' anger. Those who participated in the accusation included Fang Dagu, whose four children were all buried in this devil's lair, the orphaned girls who had just been reborn, and other mothers who had lost their own children. More than 80,000 people shouted in one voice: demanding that the government arrest the murderers and severely punish them! The government representative immediately announced that they accepted the demands of the masses, and based on conclusive evidence, arrested and detained Guo Shiji and Xu Laide. The masses expressed their heartfelt gratitude with enthusiastic cheers and applause.

Now, the infants and children of the orphanage have returned to the embrace of the motherland. This place, which used to be a killing field for American imperialism, will be turned into a paradise for children in the hands of the people.

The people of all circles in Wuchang went to the orphanage to see the corpses of the Chinese children who were killed by the American imperialist elements, and unanimously expressed infinite hatred, determined to avenge the children.

The corpses of the persecuted infants, only a small part of which has been excavated, have filled four coffins.

　　美帝国主义的杀人工厂——武昌花园山天主堂育婴堂
　　伍云甫　朱文尧
    继南京、广州、杭州、赣州、重庆等地连续发现帝国主义分子假借“慈善”招牌，虐杀中国儿童的事件后，武汉市又发现了美帝国主义虐杀中国儿童的滔天罪行。
    一九二八年，美帝国主义分子在武昌花园山开辟了一座杀人场——天主堂“育婴堂”。二十三年来，该堂虐杀了一万六千名中国儿童。婴儿的尸体被埋藏在该堂的后山坡上。现已发掘出的手、脚、头颅盖等碎骨，就装满了好几口大棺材。
    武昌花园山育婴堂的创办人是原天主教武昌教区美籍主教艾原道。一九四六年，美帝国主义分子天主教武昌教区正副主教郭时济、徐赉德继承了这一血腥事业。堂内具体工作，则由柯爱德等五个美国修道负责。武汉解放前夕，这五个美国修道先后狼狈返国，把堂内工作交由高壮英等十八个中国修道主持。这些人，由郭时济、徐赉德指挥。为什么美帝国主义死死抓住“育婴堂”不放呢？我们从郭时济、徐赉德寄给美国教会的报告中，得知他们是在有计划地利用所谓“育婴堂”、“孤儿院”来实现大批屠杀我国后一代的阴谋。报告中说：“育婴堂的目的是‘拯救灵魂’，自一九二四年拯救起，每天不断有许多灵魂上了天。”“这工作是使我们愉快和安慰的泉源。”在郭、徐这种“拯救灵魂”的工作中，婴儿死亡率真是骇人听闻。据亲手挖沟埋尸的一个工友讲，他挖的沟槽长五六尺，宽深各二尺，他一沟一沟地埋着尸体，“每十天便可填满一个沟”。不少修道及工友的谈话都证明：该堂过去平均每天收婴儿二至四个。如以每年收进七百婴儿计算，二十三年共收进一万六千余人。现在该堂内仅有婴儿、孤女和侥幸成人的青年共一百零五名。这就是说，婴儿死亡率在百分之九十九以上！婴儿的高度死亡率，从该堂寄往美国的另一份材料中也可得到证明：“从一九二○年到一九四○年，黄石港和花园山有四万灵魂上了天堂。”
    凶手们的手段是极端残忍野蛮的。育婴堂在花园山占地九千六百七十二市方尺，但是，“育婴”的地方却只有两个方丈大小的房间。婴儿收进后就与其他被折磨病了的孩子挤在一起。满屋恶臭难闻。婴儿大小便没人过问，两腋和屁股被淹得大都红烂，大便在背上结成了干块，最后连皮带肉剥下。肺炎、肠胃病、砂眼、疮及其他可怕的传染病，分布在每个婴儿身上。孩子消瘦下去，溃烂下去，有的三岁不会走路、说话，有的体重减到三磅……然后，他们被弃置在一间黑暗的地下室里，任老鼠咬啃他们的眼睛和鼻子。婴儿死后就被一排排一层层地埋在后山坡上的沟槽里。
    美国凶手一方面屠杀婴儿，一方面又设法养大几个婴儿，给他们进行无偿的劳动。孩子们不到十岁就得做活，每天要劳动十六小时！灭绝人性的徐赉德，一次就吞没了孩子们从去年一月到今年四月给堂外洗衣做活的全部收入——八百余万元。孩子们遭受了美国神父的残酷摧残。侥幸活到现在的五十多个孤女中，有七个傻子，三个癞痢头，三个麻子，三个患神经病者。有一个孩子，六、七岁了还没有一颗牙齿。美国凶手们绞杀了她们的思想。她们不知道有祖国，只知道“美国人的恩典”。美国修道告诉她们：“要作个守本分的人，死后才能升天堂”。不守“本分”或是不供驱使的就遭毒打，或是被迫地任凶手们随意把她们嫁给外人。美国修道把她们严格地分为孤儿、愿学、试学、初学、修道五级。她们之间不能说话，不能互相来往。院内的事更不准对外人讲。凶手们也不准外人前往参观。
    野兽们的血腥罪孽终被武汉人民发现了。曾在该院做过修道的刘翠英首先在报纸上揭发了这一事实。武汉市救济分会及民主妇女联合会等单位于今年四月至该院调查，探察埋藏婴儿尸体的地点，并开始挖掘工作。前往工作的人员曾受到美帝国主义分子的抗拒和破坏。他们利用晚间忏悔的宗教仪式来麻痹、恐吓和威胁已经觉醒的孤女和修道，同时利用一些走狗到处散播谣言。但在堆堆白骨面前，美帝国主义分子是无法狡赖的！
    五月二十六日，武昌八万四千人举行的控诉大会，是群众怒火的集中爆发。参加控诉的有四个孩子都葬送在这魔窟里的方大姑，有刚获新生的孤女们，以及其他失掉亲生骨肉的母亲们。八万多人喊出了一个声音：要求政府逮捕凶手，严惩凶手！政府代表当即宣布接受群众要求，并根据确凿罪证，逮捕扣押郭时济和徐赉德。群众以狂热的欢呼和鼓掌表示衷心的感激。
    现在，育婴堂的婴儿和儿童已回到祖国的怀抱，这个曾是美帝国主义的杀人场的地方，在人民的手中，将会变成孩子们的乐园。（附图片）    
　　武昌各界人民到育婴堂去看被美帝国主义分子害死的中国儿童的尸骨，一致表示无限愤恨，决心为孩子们复仇。
　　被残害婴孩的尸骨，仅发掘了一小部分，就装满了四口棺材。
