The National Cooperative Headquarters Calls on Cooperative Members and Cotton Farmers to Launch a Patriotic Cotton Selling and Stockpiling Campaign
Fully Explain to Cotton Farmers the Importance of Supplying National Cotton

[This newspaper reports] The following is the instruction from the National Cooperative Headquarters regarding calling on cotton farmers to launch a cotton selling and stockpiling campaign:

The All-China Federation of Cooperatives calls on all members of cooperatives and cotton farmers in all cotton-producing areas to launch a cotton-selling and stockpiling campaign to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes, and defend the country, to ensure the victorious realization of the Central People's Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Cotton Purchasing and Storage Work."

Before the new cotton crop is available this year, the nation's yarn mills' need for raw cotton is greater than the supply, which seriously affects the increase in production of yarn and cloth and will affect the supply of yarn and cloth needed by the military, civilians, and cotton farmers nationwide.

The current shortage of raw cotton is due, on the one hand, to the fact that last year's cotton production, although increased and abundant, was still not sufficient to meet the total needs of our country's yarn mills. On the other hand, it is also because cotton farmers in various regions still have cotton in hand, and their lives have improved since the land reform, so they are not in a hurry to sell. As a result, the state and cooperatives have reduced their purchases of cotton, and yarn mills are experiencing difficulties in obtaining raw cotton, and have begun to suspend work and reduce production. This is a major event related to the national economy and the lives of the military and civilians, and must be given serious attention by cooperatives in cotton-producing areas. A widespread and in-depth mobilization of cotton farmers should be carried out immediately, and in conjunction with the patriotic production increase movement to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes, cotton farmers who currently have cotton in storage should be called upon to launch a cotton selling and stockpiling campaign to ensure the timely supply of raw cotton so that yarn mills can continue to operate as a patriotic expression of cooperative members and cotton farmers to the country.

The National Cooperative Headquarters requires cooperatives in cotton-producing areas to immediately explain the following issues to cotton farmers in concrete terms, in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council:

1.  The improvement of cotton farmers' lives is due, on the one hand, to the improvement of cotton farmers' production enthusiasm, "loving the country and becoming rich, planting more cotton." On the other hand, more fundamentally, it is because the government has adopted a policy of restoring and developing industry, increasing the production of the textile industry, and adopting a policy of self-sufficiency in raw cotton without relying on foreign countries, which has made the cotton farmers' cotton have a reliable market. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, factories mainly relied on imports of cotton, and in 1946, imports of American cotton reached more than 6.9 million dan, accounting for more than half of the raw cotton needed by the country's yarn mills. Now the People's Government has completely changed this situation, protecting the interests of cotton farmers, and therefore cotton farmers should also help the People's Government realize the policy of self-sufficiency in raw cotton and not relying on foreign countries.

2.  In order to increase cotton production and ensure the supply of raw cotton to public and private yarn mills, so as to promote the recovery and development of China's cotton textile industry, the government has taken a series of measures that are beneficial to cotton farmers: (1) Announcing reasonable comparative prices for cotton and grain, and opposing speculative merchants from suppressing prices, to ensure the minimum price actually obtained by cotton farmers selling cotton. (2) Implementing a policy of "superior quality, superior price, and inferior quality, inferior price," giving fair and reasonable prices according to grade. (3) In terms of fiscal taxation, cotton fields and grain fields are equally burdened, and cotton fields can also use cotton to offset public grain. (4) During the spring plowing season, state-owned trade and cooperatives transferred a large number of bean cakes and supplied the fertilizers needed by cotton farmers in a timely and inexpensive manner. (5) In order to improve farmers' cotton planting enthusiasm, a large-scale pre-purchase work was also carried out this year. (6) In addition to the above five preferential treatments, cotton farmers who participate in cooperatives can also enjoy preferential treatment in the allocation and general supply of materials (including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural tools).

3.  In order to mobilize cotton farmers to carry out a cotton selling and stockpiling campaign, it is necessary to use various methods to explain the principles and explain the advantages and disadvantages to the broad masses of cotton farmers. (1) Explain that the State Council's instructions on cotton purchasing and storage this time stipulate that state-owned trading companies and cooperatives purchase cotton farmers' cotton at reasonable market prices and use methods of storing cotton that are beneficial to cotton farmers to absorb cotton farmers' in-kind savings or discounted savings. The purpose is, on the one hand, to obtain raw cotton to supply yarn mills; on the other hand, it is to guarantee the interests of cotton farmers. This is only beneficial to cotton storage households and there is absolutely no loss. At the same time, use concrete examples to illustrate that the People's Government's policy of supporting cotton farmers is a win-win policy that is both beneficial to cotton farmers' prosperity and to the country's development of the cotton textile industry. Break down cotton farmers' fears of "standing out" and fears of revealing wealth. (2) Emphasize the interdependent relationship between industry and agriculture, textile workers and cotton farmers. Without the textile industry, there would be no need or possibility to greatly increase cotton production. It is necessary to ensure the supply of raw cotton to the textile industry in order to maintain the operation of yarn mills, ensure the sales of cotton, and ensure that farmers get high-quality and inexpensive yarn and cloth. This is a policy issue that takes into account both public and private interests, urban-rural mutual assistance, and the worker-peasant alliance. Any one-sided plan may affect the overall interests. (3) Use the patriotic spirit of the volunteer army's victory and the yarn factory workers' increased production to inspire cotton farmers' patriotic enthusiasm, call on cotton farmers to launch a cotton stockpiling competition, and use the guarantee of the yarn factory's raw cotton supply to respond loudly to the volunteer army and yarn factory workers, and unify political tasks with economic tasks, and cotton farmers' personal interests with the interests of the entire country.

The National Cooperative Headquarters firmly believes that cooperatives in cotton-producing areas can victoriously complete this glorious task. At present, it is the high tide of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the enthusiasm of the masses is high; the cotton-producing areas are also mainly in the old liberated areas, and the masses already have a high degree of political awareness, and the regulations on all methods of purchasing and storing cotton and the interests of cotton farmers are also completely in line. Therefore, it is necessary to seize all these favorable conditions and actively carry out the work of purchasing and storing cotton on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary participation.

The National Cooperative Headquarters requires cooperatives in cotton-producing areas to launch a cotton selling and stockpiling competition between grassroots cooperatives and grassroots cooperatives, and between cotton farmers and cotton farmers, with the county as the unit. Those who have achieved outstanding results should be given honorary and material rewards; and it should be guaranteed that cotton storage households have the priority right to sell cotton and purchase daily necessities when the new cotton is available. In order to launch a mass cotton selling and stockpiling movement, local cooperatives should also pay attention to:

(1) Prepare well for the representative meetings of grassroots cooperatives. First launch mutual challenges and launch competitions in areas where preparations are mature.

(2) In order to smoothly carry out this work, cooperatives in cotton-producing areas should investigate the local situation of grain, coal, and feed shortages, and ensure that cotton is purchased in exchange for these supplies in a timely manner.

(3) It is necessary to take care of the difficulties that cotton farmers may encounter in the future, and solve their needs for waterwheels, agricultural tools, topdressing, pesticides, sprayers, and other items in a timely manner.

This is the first time that the cooperative has called for a competition. We lack experience. Therefore, the experience of carrying out this work in various places must be reported in a timely manner. Correspondents from various places should also take the cotton stockpiling competition as the main content of reporting during this period.

　　全国合作总社号召合作社社员和棉农
    开展爱国主义售棉存棉竞赛
    向棉农充分解释供应国家棉花的重要
    【本报讯】全国合作总社关于号召棉农开展售棉存棉竞赛的指示如下：
    全国合作社联合总社号召各产棉区合作社的全体社员和棉农，展开抗美援朝保家卫国的售棉、存棉竞赛，来保证中央人民政府政务院“关于购棉储棉工作的指示”的胜利实现。
    今年新棉上市以前，全国纱厂所需原棉供不应求，严重影响纱布的增产，并将影响对全国军民包括棉农所需纱布的供应。
    目前原棉不足，一方面是因为去年棉花虽然增产丰收，但还不足以供应我国纱厂的全部需要。另一方面，也因为各地棉农尚有存棉在手，土地改革以后生活改善，并不急于出售。因此国家和合作社购进棉花减少，纱厂原棉来源困难，已开始停工减产。这是关系国家经济和军民生活的大事，必须引起产棉区合作社的严重注意，应立即对棉农进行普遍深入的动员，并结合抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国增产运动，号召目前尚存有棉花的棉农，开展售棉存棉竞赛，保证原棉的及时供应，使纱厂继续开工，作为合作社社员及棉农对于国家的一种爱国表示。
    全国合作总社要求产棉区合作社立即本着政务院的指示，向棉农具体说明以下几个问题：
    一、棉农生活的改善，一方面是由于棉农生产积极性的提高，“爱国发家，多种棉花”。另一方面，更基本的是因为政府采取了恢复和发展工业的方针，提高了纺织工业的生产，采取了原棉自给而不仰赖外国的方针，才使棉农的棉花有了可靠的销路。过去在国民党反动统治时期，工厂用棉主要依靠进口，一九四六年进口美棉曾达六百九十余万担，占全国纱厂所需原棉半数以上。现在人民政府完全改变了这一种情况，保护了棉农的利益，因而棉农也应该帮助人民政府实现原棉自给、不仰赖外国的方针。
    二、政府为增产棉花，保证公私纱厂的原棉供应，以促进我国棉纺织工业的恢复和发展，曾采取了一系列的有利于棉农的措施：（一）公布棉粮的合理比价，并反对投机商人压价，保证棉农出售棉花实际所得的最低价格。（二）实行了“优级优价，低级低价”，公平合理地按级给价的政策。（三）财政征收上实行棉田粮田同等负担，棉田并得以棉花抵交公粮。（四）春耕时期曾通过国营贸易与合作社调运大批豆饼，及时地廉价供应了棉农需用的肥料。（五）为提高农民种棉情绪，今年还进行了大规模的预购工作。（六）除上述五种优待之外，参加合作社的棉农还可享受配售及一般供应物资（包括种籽、肥料、杀虫药和农具）上的优待。
    三、为了动员棉农进行售棉存棉竞赛，必须采用各种方式向广大棉农讲清道理，说明利害。（一）说明政务院这次关于购棉储棉的指示，规定国家贸易公司和合作社按合理牌价收购棉农的棉花，并以有利于棉农的储棉办法，吸收棉农的实物储蓄，或折价储蓄，其目的一方面是为取得原棉，供应纱厂；另一方面还是为保证棉农利益。这对存棉户只有好处，绝无损失。同时应用具体事例，说明人民政府扶助棉农政策是既利于棉农发家，又利于国家发展棉纺织工业的两利政策。打破棉农怕“冒尖”，怕露富的思想顾虑。（二）强调说明工业与农业、纺织工人与棉农的相互依存关系，没有纺织工业，就不需要也不可能大量增产棉花。必须保证对纺织工业的原棉供应，才能维持纱厂开工，保证棉花的销路，保证农民得到物美价廉的纱布。这是公私兼顾，城乡互助和工农联盟的一个政策性的问题。任何片面的打算都可能影响整体的利益。（三）以志愿军打胜仗和纱厂工人增加生产的爱国主义精神，激发棉农的爱国热情，号召棉农展开存棉竞赛，用保证纱厂的原棉供应来响亮地回答志愿军和纱厂工人，将政治任务与经济任务，棉农的个人利益与整个国家的利益统一起来。
    全国合作总社坚信各产棉区合作社可以胜利地完成这一光荣任务。目前正是抗美援朝保家卫国和镇压反革命的高潮，群众的积极性正在昂扬；产棉区又主要是在老解放区，群众已有高度的政治觉悟，购棉存棉一切办法的规定和棉农的利益也是完全符合的。因此，必须抓紧这一切有利条件，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，积极展开购棉存棉工作。
    全国合作总社要求产棉区合作社展开以县为单位的基层社与基层社、棉农与棉农间的售棉存棉竞赛，对成绩卓著者，应予以名誉的和物质的奖励；并保证在新花上市时，存棉户有卖花和购买日用必需品的优先权利。为了展开一个群众性的售棉存棉运动，各地合作社还应注意：
    （一）有准备地开好基层社的代表会议。在酝酿成熟的地区首先发动互相挑战，展开竞赛。
    （二）为了顺利展开这一工作，产棉区合作社应调查当地缺粮、缺煤、缺饲料的情况，保证及时地以这些供应品换购棉花。
    （三）必须照顾棉农今后可能发生的困难，及时解决其水车、农具、追肥、杀虫药、喷雾器等各项需要。
    这是合作社第一次号召竞赛。我们缺乏经验。因此各地进行这一工作的经验必须及时通报。各地通讯员也应以存棉竞赛为这一时期报道的主要内容。
