　　Of the 3,017 townships in the Northwest region that implemented land reform last winter and this spring, all but the more than 400 townships in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have been largely completed. It is estimated that the more than 400 townships where land reform has not yet been completed can also be largely completed before the wheat harvest. After the wheat harvest, the issues left over from the land reform movement can be dealt with to thoroughly complete this historical task. The above-mentioned areas that have implemented land reform are almost all important agricultural areas in the Northwest. Guanzhong is a nationally famous cotton and wheat producing area. After the peasants were liberated, they organized themselves and challenged the Li Shunda mutual aid group, participating in the patriotic production increase competition movement. There are forty-seven agricultural labor mutual aid groups in Xingping County, Guanzhong, and they recently launched a competition for summer harvesting and summer selection throughout the country.

　　The areas in the Northwest that implemented land reform last winter and this spring mainly included more than 40 counties in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province; in addition, there were the suburbs of Xi'an City, parts of the Yulin Special Zone of Shaanxi Province, five counties in the Qingyang Special Zone of Gansu Province, and Ningxia Province's NingShuo and Yanchi counties (parts of the five counties in Qingyang Special Zone and Yanchi County in Ningxia Province were old areas that had been occupied during the Liberation War, and this time they only adjusted land, determined land rights, and issued land certificates). The above totaled 3,017 townships. These areas were all around the old Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia liberated area. The land reform movement in the old area had a great influence on the peasants in these areas. At the same time, these areas were mostly the bases for Hu Zongnan's bandit troops to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia liberated area in the past. The reactionary landlords and counter-revolutionaries oppressed the peasants very severely. Therefore, once these areas were liberated, the peasants' demands for land and political liberation were very urgent. In July last year, the second meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee officially decided to implement land reform in the above-mentioned areas. After that, local people's governments and Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party engaged in full preparation and selected typical villages to try out land reform. In November last year, the land reform movement in the above-mentioned areas was universally launched.

　　The land reform in more than 2,000 townships in the Guanzhong area was carried out in three batches. The first batch of more than 800 townships was largely completed at the beginning of this year. At that time, the work cadres' viewpoint of relying on the masses was not clear, and there was a more general style of monopolizing and substituting in the work, and the peasant masses were not fully mobilized. After summarizing the first phase of work, the problem of the cadres' monopolizing and substituting was solved, and the land reform movement quickly reached a climax. The broad masses of peasants rose up to carry out a series of struggles against the landlord class, and the people's courts in various counties legally punished lawless landlords, bullies, and counter-revolutionaries who sabotaged the land reform decrees, thus smoothly completing the land reform in most areas of Guanzhong.

　　Now, in the areas where land reform has been completed in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, peasants who previously had no land or little land have been allocated about three mu of land, and the feudal forces have been overthrown by the peasants. In the more than 800 townships in the first batch of land reform in the Guanzhong area and in Ningsuo County, Ningxia Province, more than one million mu of land were confiscated and requisitioned according to law in this land reform; more than 30,000 head of livestock and more than 200,000 pieces of farm tools were confiscated according to law. The peasants obtained land and means of production, and their patriotic enthusiasm for increased production was unprecedentedly high. Whether in the Guanzhong area or the Qingyang Special Zone of Gansu, members of the peasants' association have accounted for more than 30% of the rural population, and most of the conscious and outstanding peasants have been selected as rural cadres, and the peasants have become the real masters in the countryside. Now, they are further launching the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the production movement; and they are assisting the people's government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries to consolidate the victory of land reform. The liberated peasants wholeheartedly thank the people's government and the Communist Party. An old woman named Liu, 77 years old, in Dadong Village, Chang'an County, personally made two pairs of shoes, two pairs of socks, and a pillow after being allocated land, and asked the people's government to forward them to Chairman Mao to express her feelings.

　　Now, the people's governments in the suburbs of Xi'an City, Ningsuo, Yanchi, and the five counties of Qingyang Special Zone have issued land ownership certificates or temporary land ownership certificates. The remaining areas will be issued after autumn.

### 西北关中等地区土地改革大体完成  打垮封建势力后农民爱国增产热情空前高涨

　　西北关中等地区土地改革大体完成
    打垮封建势力后农民爱国增产热情空前高涨
    西北区去冬今春实行土地改革的三千零十七个乡，除陕西省关中地区还有四百多个乡没有结束以外，其余都已经大体上完成了。还没有结束土地改革的四百多个乡，估计收麦以前也可大体完成，收麦后就可处理土地改革运动遗留的问题，彻底完成这一历史任务。上述实行土地改革的地区，差不多都是西北的重要农业区。关中更是全国著名的棉麦产区，农民翻身后，纷纷组织起来向李顺达互助组应战，参加爱国丰产竞赛运动。关中兴平县有四十七个农业劳动互助组，最近并向全国发动了一个夏收、夏选的竞赛。
    去冬今春西北实行土地改革的地区，主要是陕西省关中地区的四十多个县；此外有西安市的郊区，陕西省榆林专区的部分地区，甘肃省庆阳专区的五个县，和宁夏省宁朔、盐池两个县（庆阳专区五县部分地区和宁夏省盐池县，是解放战争中沦陷过的老区，这次只是进行调剂土地、确定地权和发土地证）。以上一共是三千零十七个乡。这些地区都在过去的陕甘宁解放区的周围，老区的土地改革运动对这些地区的农民有很大的影响。同时，这些地区过去大部分是胡宗南匪军进攻陕甘宁解放区的根据地，反动地主和反革命分子对农民压迫很厉害，因此，这些地区一经解放，农民对土地、对政治翻身的要求就很迫切。去年七月，西北军政委员会第二次会议正式决定在上述地区实行土地改革。此后，各地人民政府和中国共产党各级党委会即从事充分的准备工作，又选择典型乡村试办过土地改革。去年十一月，上述地区的土地改革运动就普遍展开了。
    关中地区二千多个乡的土地改革是分三批进行的。第一批八百多乡今年年初即已大体完成。当时，工作干部依靠群众的观点不明确，在工作中间较普遍地有包办代替的作风，没有充分发动农民群众。总结第一期工作后，干部的包办代替问题解决了，土地改革运动很快地就达到了高潮。广大农民起来向地主阶级进行了一系列的斗争，各县人民法庭依法惩办了破坏土地改革法令的不法地主、恶霸和反革命分子，这样就顺利地完成了关中大部地区的土地改革。
    现在陕西、甘肃、宁夏三省已完成土地改革的地区，从前无地或少地的农民都分得了三亩左右土地，封建势力已被农民打垮。关中地区第一批实行土地改革的八百多乡和宁夏省宁朔县农民在这次土地改革中依法没收和征收的土地共一百多万亩；依法没收的耕畜共三万多头、大小农具共二十多万件。农民获得了土地，又获得生产资料，爱国增产的热情空前高涨起来。无论关中地区或甘肃庆阳专区，农民协会的会员已占农村人口的百分之三十以上，觉悟的优秀的农民大多被选拔为农村干部，农民成了农村中真正的主人。现在，他们正进一步展开着抗美援朝运动和生产运动；并正协助人民政府镇压反革命，来巩固土地改革的胜利。翻身的农民衷心地感谢人民政府和共产党。长安县大东村一个七十七岁的刘老婆在分得土地后，亲自做了两双鞋、两双袜和一付枕头，请求人民政府转送给毛主席，来表示她的心意。
    现在，西安市郊区、宁朔、盐池和庆阳专区五县，人民政府已颁发了土地所有证或临时的土地所有证。其余地区将等秋后再行颁发。
