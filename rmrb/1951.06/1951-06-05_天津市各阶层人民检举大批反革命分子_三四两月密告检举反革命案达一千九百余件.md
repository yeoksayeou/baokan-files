　　Tianjin Citizens of All Classes Expose a Large Number of Counter-Revolutionaries
    Over 1,900 Cases of Secret Reports and Exposes of Counter-Revolutionary Cases in March and April
    [This newspaper reports] Since Tianjin vigorously suppressed counter-revolutionaries, it has further ensured production and construction and social security, enabling the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to be carried out more smoothly. This brilliant achievement is inseparable from the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people. Due to the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the political awareness and vigilance of the broad masses of the people have been universally improved. In order to protect their own vital interests, they have reported and exposed counter-revolutionaries to thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary activities. According to incomplete statistics from the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau in March and April, a total of 1,967 cases were secretly reported or exposed to the government by citizens, an average of more than 30 cases per day. These informants include people from all walks of life, including workers, students, citizens, and business circles. When reporting, they unanimously stated: We must universally establish patriotic pacts, protect our free and happy lives, and protect the great victory of Resist America, Aid Korea. We will not allow any counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities.
    In assisting the government in exposing counter-revolutionaries, the working class demonstrated a high degree of awareness. Li Shulan, a young female worker at the private Dasheng Cotton Mill in Tianjin, has been paying attention to the activities of Yu Datong, a KMT secret agent of the Central Statistics Bureau, who lived near her since liberation. She discovered that Yu Datong not only did not register with the government, but also spread rumors everywhere. So she reported him to the government. Guo Youqian, a worker at the luggage room of the North Railway Station, was forced to leave his home and wander around by the secret agent Guo Manzhi. After liberation, he was always determined to avenge this. He believes that this is not only revenge for his family but also for many ordinary people. During the Japanese puppet regime, Guo Manzhi killed and buried alive more than 30 people, as far as Guo Youqian knew, and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities after liberation. On the morning of March 19, when Guo Youqian went out to buy things and returned to the station, he happened to meet him on the road, so he chased after him, chasing him for dozens of miles, and finally captured him and brought him to justice.
    Lu Qinghai, a member of the Third Branch of the Second Branch of the Tricycle Workers' Union, when he discovered that the "guest" he was pulling, Yin Junsheng, was a fugitive, remembering the model deeds of Shang Guanghe in capturing secret agents, resolutely refused the bribe and sent him to the public security personnel. Another tricycle worker, Shan Hongbin, also exposed Gao Hongpu, a traitor and secret agent who continued to carry out sabotage activities under the guise of pedaling a tricycle after liberation.
    In schools, the vast number of teachers and students, in order to protect their happy and stable learning environment, also actively exposed hidden enemies. The secret agents Dong Cunyi and Yun Zhaoyang, who were hidden in the Normal College, were both professional counter-revolutionaries who had always been anti-people. Dong was a confidant of Xiong Fei, the head of the KMT's Three People's Principles Youth League, and constantly spread rumors and carried out sabotage after liberation, provoking discord among teachers and students; he not only refused to register himself, but also obstructed others from confessing and surrendering. Yun was a secret agent of the KMT's Central Statistics Bureau, and after liberation, he privately hid weapons such as bayonets and bullets, and privately equipped himself with keys to the school's offices, secretly reading students' letters, etc., in an attempt to carry out sabotage. Since the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the teachers and students of the college have paid attention to the activities of the two criminals, obtained evidence of their crimes, and reported them to the public security department in one fell swoop and arrested them. The first-year students of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Industrial School affiliated to Hebei Institute of Technology also reported to the government He Peiyi, a reactionary element hidden in the school. Among elementary school students, there are also many model deeds similar to those of Hu Chengzhi and other seven young heroes. Cai Yitian, a first-grade elementary school student at the Central Elementary School in the Eleventh District, saw a person tearing up slogans on the road, which aroused his high sense of responsibility to protect the motherland, and he mustered up his courage to question him. When the person tried to escape, he followed him and reported to the police station. Later, an investigation revealed that the person was indeed a secret agent.
    Among the general public, model figures like Aunt Yao and Wang Shulan are also emerging in endlessly. Wang Xiuhua, a housewife, when she was chatting with the wife of Sun Baoshen in the same courtyard, discovered that Sun Baoshen was a counter-revolutionary who had killed many people in Tianjin County, so she paid attention to monitoring him at any time. After the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, she discovered that Sun was trying to escape, and immediately reported it to the police station and arrested him. Yuan Kuizhong, who lived in the jurisdiction of the Fuxingli Police Station in the Sixth District, was also a reactionary criminal with a lot of blood debts. Li Zhanwu, a nearby citizen, usually paid close attention to his activities and reported to the police station from time to time. Later, Li Zhanwu heard Yuan Kuizhong discussing with others that "the situation is very tight," and thought that he must be trying to escape, so he also reported it to the police station, and finally caught him and brought him to justice. Gao Mingshan, a landlord and "Dian Chuan Shi" of the "Yiguan Dao" who fled from Qingxian County, was also arrested after being reported by farmer Li Wencheng.
    Industrial and commercial figures in Tianjin have also made considerable positive contributions in this regard. Wang Jin, the manager of Fuxing Inn in Qiandezhuang, Sixth District, reported a total of three bad elements. Among them was Zhao Shouyi, a secret agent of the Japanese gendarmerie who had fled to Jinan before the liberation of Tianjin and then sneaked back to Tianjin. Xu Kecheng, the manager of Zhenxing Cart Shop in Xiyuzhuang, Ninth District, reported Chang Qingrong, a "Dian Chuan Shi" of the "Yiguan Dao" who refused to register.
    In order to protect the motherland and their own safety, awakened people also carried out resolute and merciless struggles against counter-revolutionary relatives. Zhu Zengqing, a technician at the Dadong Weaving Factory in the Eleventh District, reported his reactionary younger brother Zhu Zengxiang. When our public security personnel went to arrest him, Zhu Zengxiang said fiercely to his brother: "Is this how brothers treat each other?" He resolutely replied: "Brothers are not allowed to be counter-revolutionaries! Counter-revolutionaries will be arrested!" An Xu, an old lady citizen in Fuxingli, Sixth District, reported her son-in-law Wang Junqing and assisted the government in searching out his Kuomintang certificate, letter of appointment and other reactionary evidence.

　　天津市各阶层人民检举大批反革命分子
    三四两月密告检举反革命案达一千九百余件
    【本报讯】天津市大张旗鼓地镇压反革命以来，已经进一步保障了生产建设和社会安全，使抗美援朝运动得以更顺利的开展。这一辉煌的成绩，和广大人民的热烈拥护与支持是分不开的。由于大张旗鼓镇压反革命，广大人民的政治觉悟与警惕性普遍提高，为了保卫自己的切身利益，纷纷检举反革命分子，以彻底肃清反革命活动。据该市人民政府公安局三、四两月的不完全统计，经市民群众向政府密告或检举者，共达一千九百六十七件，每日平均在三十件以上。这些检举人当中，包括着工人、学生、市民、工商界等各个阶层的人民。他们在检举时，一致地表示：我们要普遍订立爱国公约，保卫自由幸福的生活，保卫抗美援朝的伟大胜利，我们不容许任何反革命分子进行破坏活动。
    在协助政府检举反革命当中，工人阶级表现了高度的觉悟。天津市私营达生纱厂的青年女工李淑兰，解放以后，经常注意住在她邻近的蒋匪中统特务于大通的活动，她发现于大通不但没有向政府登记，而且还到处造谣。于是她就向政府检举了他。铁路局北站行李房的工人郭有谦，曾经被特务郭满志逼得全家流离失所，解放以后总蹩着劲要报这个仇。他认为：这不但是为自己一家而是为许许多多的老百姓报仇。原来郭满志在日伪时，仅郭有谦就知道他杀害、活埋过三十多条人命，而且解放以后还继续进行反革命活动。三月十九日早晨，郭有谦出外买东西回车站时，路上碰巧遇到了他，就追了下去，足足追了好几十里路，终于擒获归案。
    三轮工会二分会三支会的会员吕清海，当他发现他拉的“客人”尹俊生是逃犯时，想起尚广和抓特务的模范事迹，毅然拒绝了贿赂，把他送交给公安人员。另一三轮工人单鸿滨，亦检举了一个解放后以蹬三轮为掩护继续进行破坏活动的汉奸特务高洪璞。
    在学校里，广大师生为了保卫自己幸福安定的学习环境，也纷纷检举暗藏的敌人。隐藏在师范学院的特务董存义和云照洋，都是一向反人民的职业反革命分子。董犯是蒋匪三青团特务头子熊飞的亲信，解放后不断地造谣破坏，挑拨师生的团结；他自己不但拒不登记，而且阻挠别人坦白自首。云匪则是蒋匪中统局的特务，解放后私藏刺刀、子弹等武器，并私配校内办公室钥匙，偷看同学信件等，企图进行破坏。大张旗鼓地镇压反革命以来，该院师生注意了两犯的活动，获得了罪证，一举向公安部门告发，予以逮捕。河北工学院附设工业学校电科一年级同学，也向政府检举了暗藏在该校的反动分子何培毅。在小学生当中，类似胡承志等七个小英雄的模范事迹也很多。十一区中心小学一年级小学生蔡义田，在路上看见一个人撕标语，引起了他爱护祖国的高度责任心，他鼓足了胆量上前质问。那人想逃走时，他又追随在后边，向派出所报告。后来一调查，那人果然是个特务分子。
    在一般市民当中，象姚大娘、王淑兰的模范人物，也是层出不穷的。家庭妇女王秀花，当她和同院孙宝申的老婆闲谈时，发现孙宝申是一个曾在天津县杀害过很多人命的反革命分子，她就随时注意监视。大张旗鼓镇压反革命以后，她发现孙匪企图逃跑，立即报告派出所予以逮捕。住在六区复兴里派出所管界的袁奎中，也是一个血债累累的反动罪犯。附近的市民李占武，平素就很注意他的活动，时时向派出所反映。后来，李占武听到袁奎中和人议论“风声很紧”，就想到他一定要逃跑，于是也向派出所报告，终于把他逮住归案。青县逃亡地主兼“一贯道”“点传师”高明山，也是经农民李文臣检举后予以逮捕的。
    天津市的工商业者，在这方面也有了相当积极的表现。六区谦德庄福兴客居经理王金，一共检举了三个坏分子。其中就有在天津市解放前曾逃往济南，后又潜回天津活动的日寇宪兵队特务赵守义。九区西于庄振兴大车店经理徐克诚则检举了拒不登记的“一贯道”“点传师”常庆荣。
    为了保卫祖国与自己的安全，觉悟了的人民，与反革命亲属也进行了坚决无情的斗争。十一区大东织布工厂技师朱曾庆，检举了自己的反动弟弟朱曾襄。当我公安人员前往逮捕时，朱曾襄向他哥哥强横地说：“亲兄弟就这个样呀？”他毅然地回答说：“亲兄弟也不许你反革命呀！反革命就要逮你！”六区复兴里的市民安徐氏老太太，检举了自己的女婿王俊卿，并协助政府搜出他的国民党证、委任状等反动罪证。
