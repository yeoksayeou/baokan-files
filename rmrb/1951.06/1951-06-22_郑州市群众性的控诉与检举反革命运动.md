　　Zhengzhou City's Mass Accusation and Exposure of Counter-Revolutionary Movement
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Yuan Ding
　　Since Zhengzhou City launched a large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries in April, after widely and deeply mobilizing the masses, a mass accusation and exposure movement has initially formed.
　　After the large-scale suppression of counter-revolutionaries began, through propaganda and mobilization among the masses, especially after the government arrested a batch, executed a batch, imprisoned a batch, and released a batch of counter-revolutionary elements, the masses recognized the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, their political consciousness rapidly increased, they changed their past view that the government was "boundlessly lenient" towards counter-revolutionary elements, eliminated their worries about not daring to accuse and expose counter-revolutionary elements for fear that the government would not support them, and actively acted to launch an accusation movement and exposed counter-revolutionary elements. For example, after accusing, workers at the automobile repair plant exposed more than thirty bandits and spies inside and outside the plant. A female worker at the Zhongnan Shoe Factory, who in the past dared to be angry but dared not speak out against a spy who had been lurking in the factory for two years and murdered her father, now boldly exposed him. Farmers in the suburbs of the city also joined this movement, accusing "Baocheng God" Li Fuhai and others. In two months, people from all walks of life in the city wrote more than 400 letters to the government reporting spies. Citizen Wang Zicheng reported a spy, Yue Zixin, who shouted reactionary slogans during the "May 1st" parade. Child Chen Jingan cleverly captured a spy who tried to buy him off with candy. During the movement, there were countless examples of wives exposing their spy husbands, sons exposing their evil landlord fathers, and exposing counter-revolutionary relatives and friends. According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of the movement, a total of 172 accusation meetings have been held in various units throughout the city, with a total of more than 125,000 participants (accounting for more than 50% of the city's total population), and 7,248 victims or family members of victims have made accusations; the government has received a total of 20,260 letters from the masses requesting suppression or exposing counter-revolutionaries. During the enlarged meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life held on May 19th and 20th alone, 4,679 letters and slips of paper signed by 40,000 people were received.
　　At present, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in Zhengzhou City is still continuing; although some people still have concerns, the majority of the people have joined the movement.

　　How did the mass suppression of counter-revolutionaries in Zhengzhou City unfold?
　　1. Leading cadres grasped and carried out ideological mobilization and specific leadership. Before the start of the movement, the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held several meetings to study the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and held three cadre meetings to mobilize. After the start of the movement, leading cadres specifically organized propaganda forces to carry out propaganda work on suppressing counter-revolutionaries, explaining policies to the masses, criticizing the paralyzing thought of "universal peace" and erroneous concepts such as "benevolence" and "benevolent governance"; and personally grasped the accusation movement, timely shifting the masses' accusations of the crimes of the United States, Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek to accusations of the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, so that the movement could proceed smoothly.
　　2. The government supported the people and fully mobilized the masses. At the beginning of the movement, Zhengzhou City did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses well. The masses knew a lot of counter-revolutionary materials, but they did not dare to report to the government, fearing "offending people" and fearing that "the government would not support them and would make things worse." Some units reported counter-revolutionary elements on the spot, but the government failed to deal with them in a timely manner and failed to carry out the necessary propaganda work. The masses regretted it and feared retaliation from the counter-revolutionaries, so they did not dare to accuse and expose them, which temporarily affected the development of the movement. As a result, counter-revolutionary sabotage activities still occurred repeatedly. After educating the masses and organizing mass accusation movements, especially after the government arrested and executed a batch of counter-revolutionary elements, the thinking of the masses changed and they began to join the movement. After that, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries immediately changed its appearance and became lively and colorful. At the same time, more counter-revolutionary materials were discovered; cases that could not be closed due to lack of evidence could now be closed; under the supervision of the broad masses, counter-revolutionary sabotage incidents were greatly reduced. The people rejoiced, and the counter-revolutionaries trembled with fear.
　　3. According to the changing ideological situation of the masses in the movement, education was carried out at any time, and the awareness of the masses was continuously improved to keep the emotions of the masses constantly full. At the beginning, Zhengzhou City did not do well in this regard; it did not carry out effective propaganda and education to the masses as the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries gradually deepened, in order to solve the new ideological problems that occurred among the masses. This caused new concerns among some people. For example, some people said: "Was there not a single wrongful execution among the batch that was killed?" This reaction from the masses pointed out new content for propaganda work to the leading cadres. The Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately decided to quickly launch systematic propaganda and education work, and took the following measures: ① Held mass lectures. A total of two sessions were held, with a total of 139 sessions (excluding those organized by each unit), with more than 80,000 listeners. The first session focused on explaining why counter-revolutionaries should be suppressed, explaining policies, drawing a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and calling on everyone to rise up to fight against counter-revolutionary elements. The second session focused on criticizing the erroneous views of "benevolence," "talent," and simple "education and transformation," explaining that the government would definitely support the people, and specifically exposing the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, arousing the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle. These lectures were directly presided over by reporters with a higher level of policy, so they were very effective. ② Propaganda and mobilization were carried out through meetings of representatives from all walks of life, meetings of residents' representatives, meetings of residents' groups, meetings of public security groups, meetings of activists of civil police, propaganda staff meetings, large and small accusation meetings. Various mass organizations ensured that propaganda was carried out to the masses in their units. Factories also held production group meetings and study meetings to carry out propaganda. All kinds of meetings have clear propaganda and education centers, and the propaganda and education materials are also specific and practical, and the role is great. ③ Launch a mass accusation movement to improve the political awareness of the masses. The experience of Zhengzhou City shows that the accusations of the masses are generally from far to near, from the past to the present, from accusing imperialism to feudal forces to bandits and spies, from accusing open enemies to hidden enemies, from accusing dead counter-revolutionary elements to still living counter-revolutionary elements. According to this law, the leadership consciously guided the masses to boldly accuse, fully expose the crimes of counter-revolutionaries, and constantly improve the awareness of the masses. ④ Use various propaganda tools and various propaganda agencies to form a strong propaganda army to carry out propaganda to the masses. The first is to use newspaper propaganda to guide the movement through newspapers. The city's 1,701 reading groups were responsible for regularly carrying out propaganda and education to the masses. The radio station was also effectively used. The city once organized 60,000 people to listen to the live broadcast of the enlarged meeting of representatives from all walks of life on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The radio station hired responsible cadres to conduct 16 radio lectures on the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries; it organized 21 broadcasts of accusations by victims or family members of victims. Relevant departments held an exhibition on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, with more than 40,000 visitors. Literary and art workers compiled and performed 22 literary and art programs on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, with more than 60,000 spectators. Propaganda tools such as slides, comic strips, leaflets, and blackboards were fully used to carry out large-scale propaganda.
　　　★
　　At present, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries in Zhengzhou City has been enthusiastically launched. However, there are still some problems that need to be solved in future movements. These problems are: the development of the movement is still uneven, such as the religious and business circles are still relatively backward; some people have not yet recognized the great significance of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and their enthusiasm for participating in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is still not enough; some people still doubt the policy of combining suppression and leniency, especially some counter-revolutionary elements, who still dare not confess and register with the government; some people still believe that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is a blitzkrieg work, "a gust of wind, and it's over." All of the above, to varying degrees, have hindered the development of the movement and prevented the movement from becoming regularized, and must be resolved as soon as possible.

　　郑州市群众性的控诉与检举反革命运动
    本报特约记者  苑丁
    郑州市自四月份大张旗鼓镇压反革命以来，经过广泛深入发动群众，已初步形成群众性的控诉、检举运动。
    大张旗鼓镇压反革命运动开始后，经过向群众宣传动员，特别是政府捕了一批、杀了一批、关了一批、放了一批反革命分子之后，群众认清了镇压反革命政策，政治觉悟迅速提高，改变了过去认为政府对反革命分子“宽大无边”的看法，消除了怕政府不给做主，而不敢控诉、检举反革命分子的顾虑，积极行动起来，展开了控诉运动，并纷纷检举反革命分子。如汽车修配厂工人在控诉之后，检举了厂内外土匪、特务三十余名。中南鞋厂一女工，过去对潜伏本厂二年、杀害过她的父亲的特务，敢怒而不敢言，现在大胆把他检举了出来。市郊农民也卷入这一运动，控诉了“保长神”李福海等。全市各界人民在两个月中向政府写了四百余封检举特务的信件，市民王自成在“五一”游行时，当场检举了喊反动口号的特务岳子信。儿童陈敬安，机警地捉住了以糖果收买他的特务分子。在运动中，妻子检举特务丈夫，儿子检举恶霸父亲，以及检举反革命亲友的事例，层出不穷。据不完全的统计，自运动开始迄今，全市各单位共召开过控诉大会一百七十二次，参加人数达十二万五千余人（占全市人口总数的百分之五十以上），有七千二百四十八名被害人或被害者家属进行了控诉；政府共收到群众要求镇压或检举反革命的信件共二万零二百六十封，仅在五月十九、二十两日召开的各界人民代表扩大会议上，就收到有四万人署名的信和纸条四千六百七十九件。
    现在，郑州市镇压反革命运动仍在继续开展；虽然有些群众还有顾虑，但大多数群众已投入运动。
      ★
    郑州市的群众性镇压反革命运动是怎样展开的呢？
    一、领导干部抓紧进行了思想动员和具体领导。运动开始之先，中共郑州市委曾几次开会研究镇压反革命问题，并三次召开干部大会，进行动员。运动开始后，领导干部又具体组织了宣传力量，做了镇压反革命的宣传工作，向群众讲解政策，批判“天下太平”的麻痹思想和“仁慈”、“仁政”等错误观念；并亲自掌握控诉运动，适时地把群众控诉美、日、蒋罪行，转移到控诉反革命罪行，使运动得以顺利进行。
    二、政府给人民群众撑腰，充分发动群众。运动开始时，郑州市没有注意很好发动群众，群众知道很多反革命的材料，但不敢向政府报告，怕“得罪人”，怕“政府不给撑腰，画虎不成反类犬”。某些单位的群众当场检举了反革命分子，但政府未能及时处理，又未进行必要的宣传工作，群众便后悔起来，怕反革命报复，而不敢控诉检举了，暂时地影响了运动的开展。因之，反革命破坏活动仍然屡次发生。经过向群众进行教育，组织了群众性的控诉运动，特别是政府逮捕、处决了一批反革命分子之后，群众思想转变了，开始投入了运动。之后，镇压反革命运动立即改观，变得有声有色。同时，反革命的材料发现得多了；因缺乏证据无法结案的案件，可以结案了；在广大群众监视下，反革命破坏事件大大减少了。人民欢欣鼓舞，反革命颤抖失色。
    三、根据群众在运动中变化着的思想情况，随时进行教育，不断提高群众觉悟，使群众情绪经常饱满。开始时，郑州市在这一点上做得也不好；没有随着镇压反革命运动的逐步深入，向群众进行有效的宣传教育，以解决群众中新发生的思想问题。这就使部分群众产生了新的顾虑。譬如有人说：“杀的那一批里，就没有一个屈的？”群众的这种反应，给领导干部指明了宣传工作的新内容。中共郑州市委立即决定迅速展开系统的宣传教育工作，并采取了如下措施：①举办群众讲座。前后共举办二次，共一百三十九场（各单位自己办的不在内），听众达八万余人。第一次着重讲解为什么要镇压反革命，说明政策，划清敌我界限，号召大家起来向反革命分子进行斗争。第二次着重批判“仁慈”观点，“人才”观点和单纯“教育改造”等错误认识，说明政府一定给人民撑腰，并具体揭露了反革命罪行，激发了群众的斗争热情。这些讲座都是由政策水平较高的报告员直接主持的，所以收效很大。②通过各界代表会、居民代表会、居民小组会、治安小组会、民警积极分子会、宣传员会、大型的和小型的控诉会，进行宣传动员。各群众团体，保证向本单位群众进行宣传。各工厂还召开了生产小组会、学习会等，进行宣传。各种会议，都有明确的宣传教育中心，宣传教育材料也具体实际，作用很大。③开展群众性的控诉运动，提高群众的政治觉悟。郑州市的经验证明，群众的控诉一般是由远及近，由过去到现在，由控诉帝国主义到封建势力到土匪、特务，由控诉公开的敌人到隐蔽的敌人，由控诉死去的反革命分子到仍活着的反革命分子。根据这一规律，领导上有意识地引导群众大胆控诉，充分揭露反革命罪行，不断提高群众觉悟。④运用各种宣传工具和各种宣传机构，组成了一支坚强的宣传大军，向群众进行宣传。首先是运用报纸宣传，通过报纸指导运动。全市一千七百零一个读报组，担负了经常向群众进行宣传教育的任务。广播电台也被有效地运用起来。全市曾一次组织了六万群众，收听扩大的各界代表会关于镇压反革命的实况广播。广播电台聘请负责干部，进行了十六次关于镇压反革命问题的广播讲演；组织了被害人或被害家属控诉广播二十一次。有关部门举行了一次镇压反革命展览会，观众达四万余人。文艺工作者编演了镇压反革命文艺节目二十二个，观众达六万余人。幻灯、连环画、传单、黑板报等宣传工具，都被充分运用起来，进行了大规模的宣传。
          ★
    目前，郑州市镇压反革命运动已热烈展开。但还有些问题须在今后运动中求得解决。这些问题是：运动发展得还不平衡，如宗教界、工商界还较落后；某些人还没有认清镇压反革命的重大意义，参加镇压反革命运动的积极性还十分不够；某些人还怀疑镇压与宽大相结合的政策，特别是有些反革命分子，还不敢向政府坦白登记；某些人还认为镇压反革命是突击性的工作，“一阵风，过去就完事”。上述种种，都或多或少地妨害了运动的开展，并妨害使运动经常化，必须尽快求得解决。
