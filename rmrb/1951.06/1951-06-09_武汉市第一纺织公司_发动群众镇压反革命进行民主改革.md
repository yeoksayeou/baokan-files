　　Wuhan First Textile Company
    Mobilizing the Masses to Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries and Carry Out Democratic Reform
    Zhao Min, Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

    The Wuhan First Textile Company, a joint public-private enterprise and Wuhan's largest textile factory, launched a campaign at the end of March this year to mobilize the broad masses of workers to participate in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, followed by democratic reforms to eliminate feudal remnants. The workers' political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm began to soar.

    Before liberation, this factory was a private enterprise closely colluding with bureaucratic capital. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries sent a group of special agents into the factory. They took control of the factory police and organized the Kuomintang district party headquarters, the Three People's Principles Youth League district headquarters, and the puppet trade union. They introduced a group of hooligans and thugs into the factory to act as foremen, controlling the workers. They also used methods such as sworn brotherhood and sisterhood to win over workers and form feudal gangs, thereby controlling all the workers in the factory. These special agents and despots beat and scolded workers, suppressed strikes, collected donations and taxes for personal gain, extorted money, raped female workers, and colluded with external inspection agents to insult and oppress workers, helping the capitalists to cruelly exploit them. In the two years after liberation, whatever the government wanted to do, these bad elements would sabotage it. They refused to register when the government organized the registration of reactionary parties and groups. The municipal public security organs had arrested several counter-revolutionary elements for reform through education. However, after these counter-revolutionary elements were leniently released, they continued to threaten the masses, sabotage production, spread reactionary rumors, and post reactionary slogans.

            Boldly Mobilize the Masses and Resolutely Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries

    In March of this year, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government began to vigorously suppress counter-revolutionaries. The Public Security Bureau arrested more than 20 counter-revolutionary elements in the factory and executed more than 10 of the main culprits. At this time, although the factory leadership also held cadre meetings to carry out some propaganda and explanation, the content was unrealistic, and the method was top-down injection, which was not easily accepted by the masses. Therefore, the masses' thinking was still quite chaotic. Those who had been harmed by special agents said that the arrests were correct and good; most people did not understand the policies, had great concerns, and were unwilling to speak; those who had participated in reactionary organizations and had connections with special agents were panicking. When the leading cadres mobilized the masses to pour out their grievances, the masses said: "There is no need to pour out our grievances. In the past, after pouring out our grievances, we cried for three days and couldn't eat, and we still didn't know where the bad guys were, so we couldn't take revenge." "There are also bad people pretending to be good people, pretending to cry for mice to pretend to pour out their grievances." After analyzing and studying this situation, the leading cadres initially clearly understood the significance of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and decided to conduct systematic and in-depth education centered on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries: educating workers to know why it is necessary to suppress counter-revolutionaries, who are the counter-revolutionary elements, and how workers can assist the government in suppressing counter-revolutionaries, etc.; and mobilize the victims to go to various workshops to use their suffering to lead others to speak out and use concrete examples to mobilize everyone to accuse the crimes of the counter-revolutionary elements. After propaganda and education, the masses' emotions began to change, and they began to talk about the evils of the special agent Zhou Sanmao and demanded to remove this stone. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau arrested Zhou Sanmao; the factory leading cadres further organized the masses to accuse the crimes of other counter-revolutionary elements. The leaders reported the demands and materials raised by the workers in the workshop and the whole factory conference to the Public Security Bureau; the Public Security Bureau arrested seven more special agents with greater crimes in the factory. All of a sudden, the whole factory was in an uproar, the complaint movement began to penetrate into the groups, and the workers and masses demanded that the special agents be dealt with quickly. The factory held a 40,000-person public trial of special agents; in addition to the factory's employees, workers from various factories, students from various schools, and some residents participated. After the accusation, the military court of the Military Control Commission held a public trial and sentenced six special agents to death. Later, the root cause was traced, explaining that the backstage of the special agents and despots was American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, and that the past suffering of the people was caused by imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits; explaining that we have achieved a decisive and great victory in the struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, and we must continue the struggle to achieve the final victory. The masses raised their eyebrows and exhaled, their political consciousness was raised step by step, and their confidence in victory was strengthened day by day. The leading cadres also explained the policies at any time, uniting and striving for the masses who had been forced to join the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and general gangs in the past, so that they could settle down and participate in the accusation together.

    After the heinous special agents were suppressed, the workers' vigilance was improved, and their labor enthusiasm was also high. During the "May 1st" Labor Day parade, the workers of the whole factory organized a patrol team to actively protect the factory. April was the Huangmei season, and it was originally estimated that the output would be 10 percent lower than in March. However, when summarizing the production in April, the output not only did not decrease, but increased by 1.5 percent. The workers said: "After venting our anger and avenging our hatred, it is easier to work!"

            Timely Leadership of the Masses to Turn to Democratic Reform

    After the initial suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the workers in each workshop continued to accuse. At this time, the target of the struggle has been expanded to small despots, feudal bosses, hooligans, and gang leaders. The masses struggled for eight or nine days, and the leadership was still hesitant and unable to make a decision. These people have contact with special agents, but they are not completely counter-revolutionary elements. Later, the leadership decided to consult with the masses before deciding how to proceed. Some people said: "To suppress counter-revolutionaries, we must suppress them cleanly!" "To turn over, we must turn over completely!" Some people said: "If the big tree is cut down, the roots will still sprout if they are not dug up." Some old workers also asked to fight these bad elements, but they said: "These people should be fought, but we must think of a good way and cannot treat them all the same." The leadership studied the current situation of the struggle and, based on the opinions of the old workers, decided to boldly support the democratic struggle of the masses, and at the same time clearly determined to treat these people differently from the big special agents and deal with them separately. From then on, the factory launched a democratic reform movement on the basis of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

    After the leading cadres clarified their thinking, they continued to deeply understand the situation and mobilize the masses to overthrow the feudal remnants. The leadership openly proposed to the masses: "Unite, organize, overthrow the feudal remnants, remove the stones, turn over, and do a good job in production." And explained to the masses that although the feudal bosses have contact with the counter-revolutionary elements, they should be treated differently; at the same time, pointed out to these feudal bosses: to honestly and frankly admit their mistakes and bow their heads to the masses.

    After investigation and research, the leadership divided these bad elements into several categories and dealt with them separately. Because the leadership let go to support the accusations of the masses, the democratic reform struggle of the Wuhan First Textile Company was carried out vigorously. The masses' emotions were higher than when suppressing the counter-revolutionaries, and the workers who had not spoken for many years spoke. Everyone said: "This is the real liberation, the real turning over!"

    In the struggle, some feudal bosses tried their best to escape. Some wooed and treated guests, trying to buy off and soften the activists; some pretended to be poor and miserable; some arranged false struggles to manipulate the venue. In addition to exposing these conspiracies at any time, the leading cadres also led the masses to concentrate their efforts on a few stubborn feudal remnants to open up the situation.

    The experience of the Wuhan First Textile Company in this period proves that the mobilization of the masses to suppress counter-revolutionaries and the democratic reform work within the enterprise should be carried out in conjunction. The feudal bosses, hooligans, feudal gangs, etc. in the old enterprises are the foundation for the rule of the counter-revolutionary elements over the workers. The worst of these people are the great despots and the heinous counter-revolutionary elements. In such enterprises, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is actually the first step in mobilizing the masses to carry out democratic reform. After these heinous main culprits are executed, the masses will become bolder and more confident, and will inevitably continue to demand to remove the feudal remnants pressing on their heads. At this time, the leading cadres must be bold and let go, organize and lead the masses to launch a struggle against them. However, the leadership must also grasp the policies and deal with them separately. For those who are of worker origin and are still basically long-term workers, special attention should be paid to carrying out education and transformation.

　　武汉市第一纺织公司
    发动群众镇压反革命进行民主改革
    武汉市总工会主席  赵敏
    公私合营的、武汉最大的纺织厂——武汉市第一纺织公司，今年三月末发动广大工人群众参加镇压反革命运动，接着又进行民主改革，肃清了封建残余势力；工人的政治积极性和劳动热情开始高涨起来。
    这个工厂在解放以前是个与官僚资本密切勾结的私营工厂。抗日战争结束后，国民党反动派就派遣了一批特务打入该厂。他们掌握厂警，并组织国民党区党部、三青团区团部和伪工会，介绍一批流氓打手混入厂内充当领班头佬，控制工人，又利用拜把子、结姊妹等方式拉拢工人，结成封建帮会，以此控制全厂工人。这些特务恶霸在厂中打骂工人、镇压罢工、收捐收税贪污自肥、敲诈勒索、强奸女工，并勾结厂外稽查特务，侮辱欺压工人，帮助资方残酷剥削工人。解放后两年来，政府要做什么，这些坏分子就破坏什么。政府举办反动党团登记，他们拒不登记。该市公安机关曾抓去几个反革命分子进行改造教育。但这些反革命分子被宽大释放后，仍然威胁群众，并继续破坏生产，散布反动谣言，张贴反动标语。
            放手发动群众坚决镇压反革命
    今年三月，武汉市人民政府开始大张旗鼓镇压反革命。公安局在该厂逮捕了反革命分子二十余人，并枪决了首恶分子十余人。这时厂内领导方面虽也召开干部会议进行了一些宣传解释，但内容不切实际，方式是自上而下的注入，不易为群众接受。因此，群众思想仍相当混乱。受过特务残害的人都说抓得对，抓得好；多数人不了解政策，顾虑很大，不肯讲话；参加过反动组织的和跟特务有联系的人则恐慌不安。领导干部发动群众诉苦，群众说：“不用诉了。过去诉了苦，三天哭的吃不下饭，还是不知道坏蛋在那里，没法报仇。”“还有坏人装好人，猫子哭老鼠地假诉苦。”领导干部分析研究了这种情况之后，才初步明确地认识了镇压反革命的意义，决定以镇压反革命为中心进行系统的深入的教育：教育工人知道为什么要镇压反革命，那些是反革命分子，以及工人如何协助政府镇压反革命等；并发动受害者到各车间去以苦引苦，以具体事例发动大家控诉反革命分子的罪行。经过宣传教育，群众的情绪开始转变过来，开始谈出特务周三毛的罪恶，要求搬掉这块石头。接着，公安局就逮捕了周三毛；工厂领导干部就进一步组织群众控诉其他反革命分子的罪行。领导方面把工人在车间诉苦和全厂大会诉苦中提出的要求和材料报告给公安局；公安局就又在该厂逮捕了七个罪恶较大的特务分子。这一下子，全厂轰动起来了，诉苦运动开始深入到小组，工人群众并要求快快处理特务。该厂就举行了四万人的控诉公审特务大会；除该厂职工外，并有各工厂工人各学校学生和一部分居民参加。控诉之后即由军事管制委员会军法处开庭公审，把六个特务判处死刑。以后，又进行了追根，说明特务恶霸的后台是美帝国主义和国民党匪帮，过去人民生活痛苦都是帝国主义和国民党匪帮造成的；说明我们对帝国主义和国民党匪帮斗争已取得决定性的伟大胜利，还要继续斗争取得最后胜利。群众扬眉吐气，政治觉悟一步步提高，胜利信心一天天加强。领导干部又随时讲明政策，团结争取过去被迫被骗参加国民党、三青团及一般帮会的群众，让他们安下心来，一起参加控诉。
    罪大恶极的特务分子被镇压后，工人警惕性提高了，劳动热情也高涨起来。“五一”劳动节大游行时，全厂工人组织纠察队积极护厂。四月份为黄梅季节，原估计产量要比三月份降低百分之十。但到总结四月份生产时，产量不但没有降低，反而超过了百分之一点五，工人说：“出了气，报了仇，做活也轻快了！”
            及时领导群众转向民主改革
    初步镇压反革命后，各车间工人继续进行控诉。这时，斗争的对象已扩大到小恶霸、封建把头、流氓打手、帮会头子等身上。群众斗争了八、九天，领导上犹疑不定，下不了决心。这些人和特务分子有联系，但并不完全是反革命分子。后来，领导方面决定和群众商量后再决定如何进行。有人说：“镇压反革命，要镇压干净！”“翻身要翻彻底！”有人说：“大树砍倒了，根不挖还会发苗。”一部分老年工人也要求斗争这些坏分子，但他们说：“这些人该斗，但要想好办法，不能一律看待。”领导上研究了当时的斗争形势，根据老年工人的意见，决定大胆放手支持群众的民主斗争，同时明白地确定把这些人和大特务分别对待、分别处理。从此，该厂在镇压反革命基础上开展了民主改革运动。
    领导干部思想上明确了以后，继续深入了解情况，发动群众打垮封建残余势力。领导方面公开向群众提出：“团结起来，组织起来，打垮封建残余势力，搬石头，翻个身，搞好生产。”并向群众说明封建把头虽和反革命分子有联系，但应分别对待；同时向这些封建把头们指出：要老老实实坦白地承认错误，向群众低头。
    经过调查研究，领导方面将这些坏分子分成几类，分别处理。因为领导方面放手支持群众的控诉，武汉市第一纺织公司的民主改革斗争轰轰烈烈地开展起来。群众情绪比镇压反革命时更高涨了，多少年不讲话的工人都讲了话。大家说：“这才真解放了，真翻身了！”
    在斗争中，一部分封建把头想尽办法逃避。有的拉拢请客，收买软化积极分子；有的装穷装苦；有的布置假斗争操纵会场。领导干部除随时揭露这些阴谋外，并领导群众集中力量对几个顽固的封建残余分子展开斗争，打开了局面。
    武汉市第一纺织公司这一段工作的经验证明：发动群众镇压反革命和企业内部的民主改革工作应该结合起来进行。旧企业中的封建把头、流氓打手、封建帮会等，正是反革命分子统治工人的基础。这些人中最坏的就是大恶霸和罪大恶极的反革命分子。在这样的企业中，镇压反革命实际上就是发动群众进行民主改革的第一步。这些罪大恶极的首恶分子被处决后，群众胆量壮大，信心提高，势必继续要求掀掉压在头上的封建残余势力。这时领导干部必须大胆放手，组织与领导群众向他们展开斗争。但是，领导方面也必须掌握政策，分别处理。对于其中是工人出身基本上仍是长年劳动的，特别应注意进行教育改造。
