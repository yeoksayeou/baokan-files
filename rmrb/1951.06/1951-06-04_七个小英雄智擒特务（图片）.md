Seven Young Heroes Cleverly Capture Special Agents
Li Hanzhang (painter)
(1) On the afternoon of May 6th, Hu Chengzhi and He Yongsen, third-grade students at the Central Primary School in the First District of Tianjin, went to Central Park to play. Suddenly, they saw two fellows whispering under the wall. Hu Chengzhi walked up to them and seemed to hear one of them say, "You go do it tonight!" Hu Chengzhi thought these two guys were probably special agents.

(2) Hu Chengzhi remembered that a relative of his grandmother's had been killed along with nine members of his family by special agents colluding with Japanese devils. The more he thought about it, the more he hated the special agents and wanted to catch these two bad guys. At this moment, those two guys stood up and left. Coincidentally, He Yongsen had gone to relieve himself, so Hu Chengzhi couldn't wait to call him and had to follow these two guys alone.

(3) After following them for a while, Hu Chengzhi thought that he was just a child and might not be able to handle them. If he reported them to the police, he was afraid that he might be mistaken. So he had to go home.

    七个小英雄智擒特务
    李汉章画
    （一）五月六日午后，天津一区中心小学三年级学生胡承志和何永森到中心公园去玩，突然看见两个家伙在围墙下嘁嘁喳喳的讲话。胡承志走到他们跟前像是听到其中一人说：“今天晚上你就去干吧！”胡承志想这两个家伙恐怕是特务。
    （二）胡承志想起：奶奶常说的有一门亲戚，被特务勾结日本鬼子将他一家十口人害死了九口。他越想越觉得特务可恨，就想要捉住这两个坏蛋。这时，那两个家伙站起来走了。偏巧何永森解手去了，胡承志顾不得叫他，只好一人跟着这两个家伙走。
    （三）跟了一会儿，胡承志想到自己是一个小孩子，怕应付不了他们，报告警察吧，又怕抓错了；于是他只好回了家。
