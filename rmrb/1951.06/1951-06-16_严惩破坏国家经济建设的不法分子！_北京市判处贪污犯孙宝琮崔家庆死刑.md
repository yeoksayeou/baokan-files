　　Severely Punish Criminals Who Sabotage National Economic Construction!
    Beijing Sentences Embezzlers Sun Baozong and Cui Jiaqing to Death
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing People's Court recently sentenced Sun Baozong, Cui Jiaqing, and others in a case involving the embezzlement of huge amounts of public funds. Sun Baozong and Cui Jiaqing, taking advantage of their positions in purchasing timber, conspired to embezzle huge amounts of state funds and sabotage national economic construction. Both were sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life. Zhang Xiaoceng colluded with state personnel in embezzling public funds and participating in the fabrication of false contracts, and was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life. Qu Xiufeng conspired to embezzle state funds and absconded; he will be severely arrested, brought to justice, and sentenced separately.
    [Beijing News Agency] The Beijing Public Enterprise Company sent Sun Baozong and Cui Jiaqing to the Northeast to purchase timber, and they colluded with private merchants to embezzle, causing significant losses to state property. The Municipal People's Supervisory Committee has investigated and verified the facts and reported them to the Municipal Government for approval before issuing punishments. A circular has been written and distributed to various units as educational material for cadres.
    The Beijing Public Enterprise Company's Construction Engineering Department undertook the construction of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Sand Casting Plant project, requiring 300,000 feet of lumber. In early September 1950, the department sent technician Cui Jiaqing to the Northeast to purchase the lumber, and the company's Business Department designated Sun Baozong, a former staff member stationed in Shenyang, to be responsible for signing contracts and receiving payments. The Northeast Forestry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry refused to issue transportation permits to Sun and Cui because they lacked certification from the Central Finance and Economics Commission. Sun and Cui falsely reported to the Municipal Public Enterprise Company that public enterprises were not allowed to purchase timber in the Northeast and suggested purchasing from private merchants holding transportation permits. The company approved the request via telegram. Sun Baozong then colluded with merchant Zhang Xiaoceng in Shenyang to conduct activities in Harbin. After Cui Jiaqing arrived in Harbin, he also met broker Qu Xiufeng and Li Fangchen, manager of the private Hexing Lumber Mill. By this point, the company had remitted a total of 1,202.35 million RMB (equivalent to 11,422 million Northeast currency at the time) to Sun and Cui, all of which was carried privately by Sun Baozong and not deposited in state banks as public funds. In October, they bribed Northeast Forest Industry Bureau employees Li Shuwen and Gan Linsheng to sign a contract under the false name "Sun Hongda" for 1,000 cubic meters of timber at 7.2 million Northeast currency per cubic meter. They also forged a false contract, represented as being between Sun and Cui on behalf of the Beijing Enterprise Company and "Sun Hongda," for 1,000 cubic meters of timber at 10.9 million Northeast currency per cubic meter, and submitted it to the company for reimbursement, embezzling a total of 3.7 billion Northeast currency. On November 6, Sun Baozong returned to Beijing to report on the work, falsely claiming that private merchant Sun Hongda had made 3.7 billion from them. The company did not investigate the matter thoroughly. After Sun returned to Harbin, the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau, suspecting their behavior, temporarily detained the timber. The company sent engineer Wu Zhongxi to Harbin to understand the situation and, after learning that both public and private entities could purchase timber from the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau, Sun and Cui's earlier lie that public enterprises were not allowed to purchase had been completely exposed. However, Wu still did not suspect Sun of embezzlement and hurriedly returned to Beijing. After Wu's return, Sun and Cui were arrested by the Harbin Public Security Bureau on suspicion of embezzlement. After interrogation, the allegations were confirmed, and they were immediately sent to Beijing. Subsequently, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau captured Zhang Xiaoceng and sent him to Beijing. Only Qu Xiufeng remains at large. A total of 195,689,999 RMB in gold and cash was recovered, leaving a loss of 19,851,6234 RMB in state property. Based on the above facts, the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee decided to impose the following penalties on the relevant personnel: Sun Baozong, a clerk of the Public Enterprise Company, and Cui Jiaqing, a technician, were dismissed from their posts and handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment according to the law. Zhao Pengfei, the current manager of the Public Enterprise Company, and Mu Kuizhong, the director of the Business Department, each received a major demerit. Wu Zhongxi, an engineer in the Construction Engineering Department, received two demerits. Zhao Dongri, the director of the Construction Engineering Department, received a warning. Private merchant Zhang Xiaoceng was sent to the judicial authorities for punishment. Qu Xiufeng is at large and should be arrested by the public security organs. Li Shuwen and Gan Linsheng, employees of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau, and Li Fangchen, manager of the private Hexing Lumber Mill in Harbin, have all been handed over to the Northeast judicial authorities for punishment.

　　严惩破坏国家经济建设的不法分子！        
    北京市判处贪污犯孙宝琮崔家庆死刑
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民法院顷判决孙宝琮、崔家庆等贪污巨额公款一案。孙宝琮、崔家庆共同利用采购木材职务上的机会，合谋贪污国家巨额公款，破坏国家经济建设，均处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。张效曾勾结国家工作人员伙同贪污公款，参与制造假合同，处无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身。曲秀峰伙谋贪污国家公款潜逃，严缉归案另判。
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市公营企业公司派往东北采购木材人员孙宝琮、崔家庆勾结私商共同贪污，使国家财产遭受重大损失的事件，已经市人民政府人民监察委员会查明事实真相，报经市府批准后分别予以处分。并已写成通报，分令各单位作为教育干部材料。
    北京市公营企业公司建筑工程处承修中央重工业部翻沙厂工程，需木板三十万英尺，于一九五○年九月初旬即派技术员崔家庆前往东北采购，并由该公司营业处指定原驻沈阳科员孙宝琮负责签订合同，收付款项。东北农林部林政局以孙崔二人没有中央财委许可证明，不予发给运输许可证，孙崔二人遂向市公营企业公司假报说：公营企业不准在东北购买木材，建议以私人身份另向持有运输许可证的私商购买。该公司即复电批准。于是孙宝琮先在沈阳勾结商人张效曾前往哈尔滨活动，崔家庆到哈尔滨后，又结识跑合商人曲秀峰及私营合兴木厂经理李芳臣参加。至此，该公司先后汇交孙崔二人的款项总共已达人民币十二亿零二百三十五万元（当时合东北币一百一十四亿二千二百余万元），均由孙宝琮私人携带，并未以公款存入国家银行。十月间，他们即贿通东北森林工业总局职员李树文、甘霖生等以“孙洪达”的假名字订立成材一千立方米，每米东北币七百二十万元的合同，又伪造由孙崔二人代表北京市企业公司与“孙洪达”订立的成材一千立方米，每米东北币一千零九十万元的假合同，向该公司报账，计共贪污东北币三十七亿元。十一月六日孙宝琮回京汇报工作，诡称被私商孙洪达赚去三十七亿元，该公司亦未深究。孙返哈后，东北森林工业总局以孙等形迹可疑，将木材暂予扣留，该公司派工程师吴钟秀赴哈了解情况，问明东北森林工业总局公私都可购买木材，孙等以前假报的公营企业不许购买的谎言本已完全暴露，但吴仍不怀疑孙等贪污，遽行返京。吴返京后，孙崔二人即被哈尔滨公安局以贪污嫌疑逮捕，经审问属实，随即解京。随后又由天津市公安局将张效曾捕获解京，仅曲秀峰在逃。前后追回黄金现款共合人民币一亿九千五百六十八万九千九百九十九元，计损失国家财产一亿九千八百五十一万六千二百三十四元，市人民监察委员会根据以上事实，决定对有关人员分别处分如下：公营企业公司科员孙宝琮、技术员崔家庆撤职，送司法机关依法惩处。公营企业公司经现赵鹏飞、营业处处长牟揆中各记大过一次，建筑工程处工程师吴钟秀记过二次，建筑工程处处长赵冬日予以警告处分。私商张效曾送司法机关惩办，曲秀峰在逃，应由公安机关通缉归案。东北森林工业总局职员李树文、甘霖生、哈尔滨私营合兴木厂经理李芳臣均已交由东北司法机关惩办。
