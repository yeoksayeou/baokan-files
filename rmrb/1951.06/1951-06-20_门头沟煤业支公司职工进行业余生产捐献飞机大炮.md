    Mentougou Coal Industry Branch Employees
   Engage in Amateur Production to Donate Airplanes and Cannons

Editor:
    In order to respond to the call of the China Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the employees of our Mentougou Coal Industry Branch have decided to organize amateur production and use all income to purchase airplanes and cannons.
    On June 8th, the No. 5 Business Office of the retail company transported a railcar of grain, unloaded it on the platform, and needed to move it into the warehouse. In the past, this work was done by temporary hired laborers. This time, with the consent of the retail company, we contracted to do it ourselves. That day, the district trade union office was showing the film "New Children of Heroes" to members of various grassroots trade unions in the theater. We all were willing to give up watching the movie to participate in patriotic voluntary labor. There were a total of thirty-two employees, and in two hours, we carried thirty tons of grain into the retail company's warehouse. During the transportation, everyone suggested: "Carrying a bag of grain earns a airplane screw!" "The more sweat we shed, the less blood the Volunteer Army comrades will shed!" Everyone's enthusiasm was particularly high, and Liu Zhongxian alone carried twenty-two bags. As a result, the retail company's warehousing work was completed ahead of schedule, and we received a salary of 168,000 yuan. Everyone unanimously decided to donate all of it to buy airplanes and cannons. At that time, we also set out a future production plan, continuing to engage in amateur production, and striving to donate airplanes and cannons, on the principle of not hindering work and not competing with workers for jobs!

    增加生产捐献飞机大炮支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗
　　门头沟煤业支公司职工       
　  进行业余生产捐献飞机大炮 编辑同志：
    我们门头沟煤业支公司的职工，为了响应抗美援朝总会号召，决定组织业余生产，将全部收入购买飞机大炮。
    六月八日，零售公司第五营业处运来一车皮粮食，卸在站台上，需要往仓库内搬运。这项工作过去是临时雇工人来做的，这次我们商得零售公司的同意，自己包下来作。当天正有本区工会办事处，在剧院给各基层工会会员演《新儿女英雄传》电影。我们大家都愿放弃看电影，来参加爱国义务劳动。我们一共有三十二个职工，用两小时功夫，就把三十吨粮食扛到零售公司仓库里。在搬运中大家提出：“扛一包粮食，就能赚一个飞机螺丝钉”！“咱们多流一滴汗，志愿军同志少流一滴血”！大家情绪特别高涨，刘仲贤一个人就扛了二十二包。结果提前完成了零售公司的入库工作，我们得到十六万八千元的工资，大家一致决定全部捐献买飞机大炮。当时我们又订出了今后的生产计划，在不妨碍工作，不与工人争活的原则下，继续从事业余生产，努力捐献飞机大炮！
