　　About the French Elections
    On the 17th of this month, France will hold elections for the National Assembly. This election is a major struggle in the political life of the French people. Because, under the instructions of its American masters, the French reactionaries have formulated a set of reactionary election laws, plotting to exclude the French Communist Party from the parliament in this election, and to turn the French parliament into a docile tool of American war policy. This is intolerable to the peace-loving and democratic French people.

    Since last autumn, the French reactionary party groups have been plotting to revise the election law in order to abolish the original proportional representation system. At the end of February this year, the former French Prime Minister Pleven proposed the so-called "two-round majority coalition election law," but due to the French Communist Party's resolute opposition and the uneven distribution of spoils among the right-wing groups, each with its own agenda, it failed to pass in the parliament; Pleven's cabinet collapsed as a result. Subsequently, Queuille came to power and proposed a "one-round majority coalition election law," which was illegally passed in the parliament. According to this reactionary election law, if a coalition formed by various French reactionary parties obtains more than 50 percent of the votes in a constituency, it can seize all the seats allocated to that district, while the French Communist Party and other parties, even if they obtain 49 percent of the votes, will not get a single seat. This reactionary election law also illegally replaced the provision of electing different numbers of deputies according to the population ratio of each constituency with the method of electing an equal number of deputies from each province, thereby打击打击 (dǎjī - strike, hit) the working class in the central and northern densely populated industrial areas. In addition, there are many other provisions that are beneficial to the reactionary groups, such as the freedom for parties to form alliances in some constituencies and not in others; if no alliance obtains more than 50 percent of the votes in some constituencies, the seats will still be distributed according to the proportional system, etc. This also shows the contradictions and respective calculations among the various reactionary parties.

    Since the 1946 National Assembly election, the French Communist Party has been the largest party in the French parliament, occupying 166 seats. Over the years, the French Communist Party has waged resolute and unremitting struggles inside and outside the parliament to defend the interests of the French people, defend national independence, and world peace, and has won the support of the broad masses of the French people. After the French parliament passed the reactionary election law at the end of February this year, the French Communist Party led the French people to fight against this sinister plot, and pointed out that the so-called new election law was paving the way for the fascist de Gaulle to come to power, so as to facilitate driving the French people to serve as cannon fodder for the American war of aggression. At the same time, in order to smash the reactionary groups' plan to exclude the French Communist Party from the parliament, it united the patriotic elements, resistance movement members, and anti-fascist fighters of France to form the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance to conduct the election campaign. The alliance also announced an election platform to win bread, freedom, democracy, and peace for the French people, expressing its determination to fight against preparing for a new war and against the enslavement of France by American imperialism. The French Communist Party's election campaign and its election platform, which conformed to the interests of the French people, won more and more support from the French people. Patriotic French people donated huge election funds to the French Communist Party to express their active support. Therefore, in the election campaign, the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance Alliance, headed by the French Communist Party, had an extremely strong momentum, which made the French reactionary groups feel deeply worried.

    The French reactionary parties, from the right-wing Socialist Party to the de Gaulle faction, had long discussed forming a unified election alliance to confront the French Communist Party. However, because the French Communist Party immediately exposed this conspiracy, the so-called "Third Force" of the right-wing Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Socialist Party, and de Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" did not dare to openly form an election alliance. In many constituencies, some de Gaulle elements even allied with the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement in the guise of so-called "independent" candidates in order to deceive the voters. However, the broad masses of the French people have recognized the despicable faces of the reactionaries and opposed the de Gaulle faction's election activities with demonstrations. At the same time, the contradictions among the various reactionary parties are also extremely deep. When two or three parties estimate that they may get close to 50 percent of the votes in a certain constituency, they refuse to ally with more parties; even among the parties that have already formed alliances, there are disputes. Therefore, the reactionary parties have failed to form a nationwide election alliance; the alliances formed in some constituencies do not include all the reactionary parties. This situation has already caused the reactionary newspapers in Paris to repeatedly issue mournful cries, "feeling uneasy."

    In this election, the democratic forces led by the French Communist Party will inevitably win more trust and support from the French people. Even if the reactionary groups steal some more seats in the parliament through their despicable conspiracies, the French people will be more awakened in this struggle. More and more French people will unite around the French Communist Party and wage a resolute struggle to smash the conspiracy to drive their motherland onto the road of war and fascism.

### 关于法国大选

　　关于法国大选
    本月十七日，法国将举行国民议会的选举。这次选举是法国人民政治生活中的一个重大的斗争。因为，法国反动派在其美国主子的指使下，制订了一套反动的选举法，阴谋在这次选举中把法国共产党排斥于议会之外，而使法国议会变成为美国战争政策的驯服的工具。这是爱好和平与民主的法国人民所不能容忍的。
    从去年秋天以来，法国反动党派集团就着手进行修改选举法的阴谋，以废除原来的比例选举制。今年二月底，前法国总理普利文提出了所谓“二轮多数联盟选举法”，但是由于法国共产党的坚决反对和各右翼集团分赃不均，各怀鬼胎，未能在议会中获得通过；普利文内阁却因而垮了台。接着，葛义上台后，又提出了“一轮多数联盟选举法”，在议会中被非法通过了。根据这种反动的选举法，法国各反动党派结成的联盟如果在一个选区中得到百分之五十以上的选票，便可夺得该区所分配的全部议席，而法共和其他党派，即使获得百分之四十九的选票，却一个议席都得不到。这一反动的选举法，而且非法地以每省选出同等数目议员的办法，代替按照各选区人口比例选举不同数目议员的规定，借此打击中部及北部人口集中工业区域的工人阶级。此外还有许多其他有利于反动集团的规定，像各党派可以随意在某些选区中结盟，而在别的一些选区中不结盟；在某些选区中如果没有任何联盟获得百分之五十以上的选票，则仍按照比例制分配议席等。这同时又表现了各反动党派之间存在着同床异梦、各自打算的矛盾。
    法国共产党自一九四六年国民议会选举以来，一直是法国议会中的第一大党，占有一百六十六个议席。历年来法国共产党在议会内外，为保卫法国人民的利益、保卫国家独立与世界和平进行了坚决不懈的斗争，获得广大法国人民的拥护。在今年二月底法国议会通过了反动的选举法以后，法共就领导法国人民为反对这一罪恶阴谋而斗争，并指出所谓新选举法是为法西斯分子戴高乐上台铺平道路，以便利驱使法国人民为美国的侵略战争充当炮灰。同时，为了要粉碎反动集团自议会中排斥法国共产党的计划，更团结了法国的爱国分子、抵抗运动分子和反法西斯战士，组成共和反法西斯抵抗联盟，进行竞选。联盟并宣布了为法国人民争取面包、自由、民主与和平的竞选纲领，表示坚决为反对准备新战争、反对美帝国主义者奴役法国而奋斗。法共的竞选活动和它的符合于法国人民利益的竞选纲领，赢得了愈来愈多的法国人民的拥护。爱国的法国人民为法共捐献了巨额的竞选基金，以表示他们的积极支持。因此，在竞选运动中，以法共为首的共和反法西斯党抵抗联盟声势极为浩大，使法国反动派集团深深感到忧虑。
    从右翼社会党到戴高乐派的法国反动党派，早就商量要结成统一的竞选联盟，来对抗法共。但是由于法共即时揭穿了这种阴谋，使得右翼社会党、人民共和党和激进社会党的所谓“第三种力量”与戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”不敢公开结成竞选联盟。在许多选区中，有些戴高乐分子竟以所谓“独立分子”候选人的姿态而与社会党和人民共和党结盟，以欺骗选民。但是广大的法国人民已认清了反动派的卑劣面目，并以示威行动来反对戴高乐派的竞选活动。同时，各反动党派之间也矛盾极深，在两三个党派估计可能得到某一个选区接近百分之五十的选票时，便拒绝与更多的党派结盟；甚至已经结盟的党派之间，也有争论。因此，反动党派未能结成全国性的竞选联盟；在某些选区所结成的联盟也并不是包括所有的反动党派的。这种情形，已经使得巴黎的反动报纸屡屡发出哀鸣，“感觉不安”。
    在这次选举中，法国共产党所领导的民主力量，必然将赢得更多的法国人民的信任与拥护。即使反动集团借其卑劣的阴谋在议会中多窃取了若干议席，但是法国人民在这次斗争中却更为觉悟了。愈来愈多的法国人民将团结在法国共产党的周围，为粉碎企图把他们祖国驱向战争与法西斯道路的阴谋而进行坚决的斗争。
