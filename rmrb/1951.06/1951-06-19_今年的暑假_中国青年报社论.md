　　This Year's Summer Vacation
    —China Youth Daily Editorial
    As this year's summer vacation approaches, the nationwide movement to Resist America and Aid Korea is entering a phase of regularity and depth. The China Peace Committee has issued a call for promoting patriotic compacts, donating airplanes and artillery, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. This is an important call during the intense and crucial stage of the war to Resist America and Aid Korea. Students should respond enthusiastically, do some propaganda work during the summer vacation, provide comfort to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and appropriately organize voluntary labor and various sideline productions, donating the proceeds to the Chinese People's Volunteers for airplanes and artillery.
    In participating in these activities, we should fully understand the significance of these activities and formulate patriotic compacts for summer work that are in line with the actual situation. Implementing the patriotic compact and earnestly completing every practical task will enable us to receive education in resisting America and aiding Korea and in patriotism through our work.
    During the summer vacation, students should also participate in various activities with patriotic ideological education as the main content, such as participating in summer camps, lectures, garden parties, travel, visits, and visiting rural areas, factories, or the relics of revolutionary martyrs. In carrying out these activities, we can see the new atmosphere in all aspects of people's lives and receive a lot of practical education. These activities can be combined with our work to resist America and aid Korea, and on the other hand, they can enable us to get appropriate rest and improve our physical health.
    The summer vacation can be used to make up for the shortcomings in one's studies this semester. For example, those who are poor in current affairs study or read few extracurricular books should read more newspapers and books during the summer vacation; if certain subjects are poor, they can make up lessons during the summer vacation.
    The summer vacation is approaching. We should plan and organize our summer life well. We should not try to solve all problems in one summer vacation, or make the work and activities too much or too heavy. The work and activities that each person participates in should not be too many. Otherwise, being busier during the vacation than during school will not only harm health, but also make work and study difficult.

　　今年的暑假        
    ——中国青年报社论
    今年暑假到来的时候，正是全国抗美援朝爱国运动进入经常和深入的时候。中国人民抗美援朝总会已经发出关于推行爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮和优待烈属军属的号召。这是在抗美援朝战争的剧烈紧要的阶段中的一个重要的号召。学生们应该热烈响应，在暑假期中做一些宣传、慰劳烈属军属等工作，并可适当地组织义务劳动和各种副业生产，将劳动所得，捐献飞机大炮给中国人民志愿军。
    在参加这些工作中，我们应该充分地认识这些工作的意义，并切合实际情况地订出暑期工作的爱国公约。执行爱国公约，认真地完成每一件实际工作，将使我们在工作中受到抗美援朝、爱国主义的教育。
    在暑期中学生们还应该参加各种以爱国主义思想教育为内容的活动，如参加夏令营、讲座、游园会、旅行、参观，访问农村、工厂或革命先烈遗迹等活动。在进行这些活动时，我们可以看见人民生活各方面的新气象，得到许多实际的教育。这些活动，既可以和我们的抗美援朝工作结合起来，而另一方面，又可以使我们得到适当的休息，增进身体健康。
    可以利用暑假来弥补这学期里自己学习上的不足。如时事学习较差或课外读物读得少的人，暑期里应该多读些报纸和书刊；如果某些功课较差，暑期里可以补课。
    暑假已经快到。我们应该好好计划和组织暑期生活。我们不要企图在一个暑假里解决一切问题，把工作和活动搞得过多过重。每人参加的工作和活动也不宜过多。否则，放假期间比上课时还忙，既有损于健康，也搞不好工作和学习。
