Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: London dispatch: The American warmonger Dulles, recently acting on Truman's orders, went to London to hold negotiations with the British government on the issue of a separate peace treaty with Japan. The first phase of negotiations, which began on June 4th and lasted until the 8th, has concluded.

Dulles's trip to London was tasked with attempting to force Britain to fully accept the US-unilaterally formulated draft peace treaty with Japan. The results of the first phase of negotiations show that Britain has yielded to the United States on many issues. According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 8th, "people who have seen the rough draft of the final treaty proposal" revealed that "Anglo-American viewpoints are now 'largely the same.'" Nevertheless, because both the United States and Britain harbor selfish imperialist aims on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, they have failed to reach a consensus on certain issues. Even Dulles himself, when leaving London on the 9th, had to frankly admit: "Differences have arisen between Western countries in the negotiations for a peace treaty with Japan. So far, the negotiations have been unsatisfactory."

According to British Foreign Secretary Morrison's revelation at a cabinet meeting on the 7th, the differences between the US and Britain included the so-called "issue of Chinese representation at the peace treaty conference." As everyone knows, the US policy is to have the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang participate in the US-drafted separate peace treaty with Japan, while Britain, given that it has announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, cannot openly accept this US proposal. Therefore, Britain is attempting to exclude the indisputable legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, just like the United States, under the guise of a "compromise." According to the British Liberal Party's *Manchester Guardian* on the 4th, Britain's "suggestion" on this issue is: "The question of who represents China to sign the treaty should be postponed until the Far East issue is resolved; the fate of Taiwan should also be postponed." This means that the British government continues to adopt a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, excluding the sacred right of the People's Republic of China to participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan in a "pending" manner, and infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of the People's China over Taiwan.

The main differences between the US and Britain on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan lie in their selfish economic interests. According to Morrison, other differences between the US and Britain include: "1. Japan recovers all Japanese stocks owned by Britain and repays its debts to Britain. 2. Taking out and disposing of two hundred million dollars worth of gold held by the United States in its capacity as an occupying power. 3. The issue of Japanese trade after the signing of the treaty and Japan's participation in the sterling area transfer system, enabling it to use sterling and other countries to clear debts." Regarding the issue of reparations, Britain hopes to use Japan's gold reserves as reparations; the United States attempts to continue to plunder them under the name of "returning them to Japan." On the issue of trade, Britain, fearing that Japanese goods supported by American capital will once again seize Britain's markets in Southeast Asia, is unwilling to grant Japan "most favored nation" treatment as stipulated in the US-made draft peace treaty with Japan. "On the contrary, Britain wants to use certain business restrictions imposed on Japan to protect its existing markets from Japanese competition" (Agence France-Presse). Other sources revealed that Britain also advocates restricting Japan's shipbuilding industry.

Dulles left London for Paris on the 9th to negotiate the issue of a separate peace treaty with Japan with the French government, and is scheduled to return to London this week to continue to exert pressure on the British government.

　　美英两国单独对日媾和谈判告一段落        
    英政府屈从美国企图排除我国正当权利       
    在赔偿与贸易等问题上两国之间尚存有很多分歧
    【新华社十二日讯】伦敦消息：美国战争贩子杜勒斯最近奉杜鲁门之命，前往伦敦与英国政府举行关于单独对日媾和问题的谈判。自本月四日起至八日为止，谈判的第一阶段已告结束。
    杜勒斯这次伦敦之行，其任务是企图迫使英国完全接受美国片面制订的对日和约草案。第一阶段谈判的结果显示：英国已在许多问题上对美国屈服。据合众社伦敦八日讯，据“已经看过最后和约建议的粗制草案的人们”透露，“英美观点现在‘大体上是相同的。’”。虽然如此，由于美英两国在对日和约问题上，均怀抱着帝国主义的自私目的，因此，它们在某些问题上，仍未能取得一致的意见。甚至杜勒斯本人在九日离开伦敦时，也不得不率直承认：“西方国家之间在对日和约谈判上发生分歧。迄今为止，谈判是不圆满的。”
    据英外相莫里逊七日在内阁会议上透露：美英两国之间的分歧，有所谓“中国出席和约会议代表权问题”。大家知道，美国的政策是要国民党残余匪帮参加美国制订的单独对日和约，而英国鉴于它已宣布与中华人民共和国建立外交关系，无法公开接受美国这一主张。因此，英国就企图在“折衷办法”的掩盖下，和美国一样，排除中华人民共和国在对日和约问题上不可置辩的正当权利。据英国自由党的《曼彻斯特卫报》四日透露，英国对这一问题的“建议”是：“谁代表中国签字的问题应延至远东问题解决以后决定；台湾的命运也应延期决定。”这就是说，英国政府继续采取敌视中国人民的政策，以“悬而不决”的方式排除中华人民共和国参加拟制对日和约的神圣权利，并侵犯人民中国对台湾的领土主权。
    美、英两国在对日和约问题上的主要分歧，在于它们之间自私的经济利益上。据莫里逊透露，美英之间的其他分歧包括：“一、日本收回英国所有的日本股票，并偿还它欠英国的债务。二、把美国以占领国资格而持有的价值两亿美元的黄金取出来并加以处理。三、和约签订后的日本贸易问题和日本参加英镑区转账体系，使它有使用英镑和其他国家清理债务的可能性。”关于赔偿问题，英国希望将日本的黄金储备充作赔偿；美国则企图用“交还日本”的名义，继续加以劫持。在贸易问题上，英国由于忧惧美国资本支持下的日本商品重新抢夺英国在东南亚的市场，因此不愿依照美制对日和约草案那样地规定给予日本以“最惠国”的待遇。“相反地，英国则想利用加在日本身上的某些商务限制来保护它既有的市场不受日本的竞争”（法新社）。其他方面消息透露，英国并主张限制日本的造船工业。
    杜勒斯已于九日离伦敦赴巴黎，与法国政府谈判单独对日媾和问题，并定于本周内重返伦敦，对英国政府继续施用压力。
