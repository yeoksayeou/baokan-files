　　Fujian People Overcome Floods and Complete Spring Planting
    By our special correspondent Liu Yuefeng
    Fujian farmers have overcome severe continuous rain and floods, and successfully completed this year's rice transplanting work. Approximately 16 million mu of rice paddies throughout the province (out of a total cultivated area of 20 million mu) have basically not reduced the transplanting area due to the floods, and in some places, the transplanting area has even increased.
    Rice cultivation in Fujian Province is divided into three types: early rice, late rice (intercropping), and single-season rice. Among them, early rice accounts for about 30 percent of the total rice cultivation. Early rice is sown in March and April, transplanted in April and May, and gradually matures in July, harvested successively from south to north. If the early rice harvest is poor, spring and summer (before the late rice harvest) famine will occur, which has a very significant impact on farmers. This year, shortly after the early rice seeds were sown, there was a rain and flood disaster rarely seen in the past thirty years. From late March to the end of April, the continuous rain did not stop. Most of the rice paddies were submerged. The downstream of the Minjiang River was the hardest hit due to the river water overflowing. Many places in the suburbs of Fuzhou and counties such as Minhou turned into a vast expanse of water, and the flood did not recede for several days. In general areas of the province, about 30 to 50 percent of the seedlings were either soaked and rotten or washed away by the water. On both sides of the Minjiang River, the loss of seedlings was as high as 80 percent in severely affected areas, and in some areas, all the rice seedlings were washed away.
    After the disaster occurred, the leading organs of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee, the Fujian Provincial People's Government, and the Provincial Farmers' Association immediately held special meetings to discuss rice seedling protection work, and determined that rescuing rice seedlings (and rushing to harvest wheat) was the overriding central task at the time. Subsequently, under the leadership of the local CPC committees, governments, farmers' associations, and work teams, farmers in various places mobilized and launched an unprecedentedly intense movement to drain water, support seedlings, wash seedlings (wash off the mud sticking to the seedlings to prevent them from lying on the ground), and rush to harvest wheat. After arduous efforts, the degree of mold and rot of the seedlings was greatly reduced, and the loss was reduced by 20 to 30 percent in general areas. However, at that time, seedlings were still scarce. After May, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers launched a widespread mutual aid movement to save and adjust seedlings, and timely overcame the difficulty of seedling shortage. Around mid-May, the transplanting of early rice in the province was basically completed. From the end of May to the first and middle ten days of June, intercropped rice and single-season late rice were also basically transplanted. At this point, this year's spring planting work was successfully completed.
    After the disaster occurred, a fairly widespread pessimistic mood arose among the broad masses. Farmers in Pandun Township, Minhou County, which was severely affected by the disaster, said, "Heaven is making things difficult, there is no way to think about it." Some people said, "The People's Government will not let us starve to death, let's wait for relief." When the mood of the masses was confused and uneasy, the Party and government leading organs accurately grasped and analyzed the disaster situation (at that time, many farmers had exaggerated emotions about the disaster), promptly pointed out the direction, and educated the masses to establish confidence in overcoming natural disasters. After the disaster occurred in the Minhou Special Zone, the local CPC committee immediately issued a notice, calling on Party committees at all levels to immediately lead the masses to rescue the disaster with all their strength. The counties convened meetings of old farmers and activists respectively to study methods of protecting seedlings (after the methods were devised, they were quickly notified to various places for imitation). Most of the responsible cadres from the special commissioner's office to the counties and districts went deep into the masses to lead the masses in emergency rescue. Wen Fushan and Rao Yunshan, the special commissioner and deputy special commissioner of the special commissioner's office, first went to the most severely affected areas to comfort the victims and personally studied disaster relief methods with the farmers, which greatly encouraged the fighting spirit of the farmers. The problem of seedling shortage in the special zone was finally completely solved under the concerted efforts of all Party, government, army, and people. After transplanting, varying degrees of spring famine and insect pests were discovered in various places, and many people had a negative and waiting mentality. The county chief of Shunchang County, the deputy secretary of the CPC County Committee, and the county chief of Minqing County and other responsible cadres immediately went deep into the masses to study the disaster situation, lead the farmers to formulate plans to survive the famine, and personally went down to the fields to lead the masses in catching insects. The farmers' enthusiasm for production and pest elimination immediately rose, and they said, "The county chief has personally come to lead, what difficulties cannot be overcome!"
    To overcome disasters, it is necessary to mobilize the masses. By closely combining the patriotic education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea with the publicity of overcoming natural disasters, the confidence of the masses is enhanced, and the strength is particularly strong. When farmer representatives in the suburbs of Fuzhou held a meeting to discuss rescuing seedlings, they also launched a movement to accuse the crimes of the U.S., Japan, Chiang Kai-shek, landlords, and local bullies. The representatives automatically proposed: In order not to let the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek ravage the people again and increase the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we must lead the farmers in the entire suburban area to overcome the difficulty of seedling shortage and continue to strive for a bumper harvest. We take this as a condition to challenge the Li Shunda mutual aid group in Shanxi. Farmers in western Fujian fought stubbornly against the floods. In some areas, seedlings were re-sown six or seven times due to mold and rot. The slogan put forward by the farmers in the first district of Minhou was: "Resisting water is like resisting the U.S., saving seedlings is like aiding Korea!" They stayed up all night, draining water and supporting seedlings in the fields. Lin Meiguan, a widow in Pandun Township, was allocated two mu and three fen of land in the land reform. She said, "I have never seen a land deed in my life, but now I have my own land, so I have to protect it. I want to fight against the floods, which is also resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea." The flood filled her field, and the seedlings rotted. She used the rice she earned from working in the rice mill during the day and grinding tofu for others at night to exchange for grain seeds to re-sow. After sowing three times in succession, she finally overcame the natural disaster.
    To overcome the floods, the broad masses of farmers launched an unprecedented mutual aid movement. In the past, one pile of seedlings had to be transplanted with more than 21 plants. This year, many farmers generally transplanted fewer rice plants, with some transplanting 13 plants per pile, and some transplanting 9 or 10 plants, which can save a lot of seedlings and help farmers who lack seedlings. When adjusting seedlings, not only was the slogan "Farmers all over the world are one family" promoted, but special consideration was also given to the principle of voluntary benefit for both parties. Farmers in Jinjiang County have a habit of selling seedlings. The local leading organs initially put forward the slogan of mutual aid for seedlings, but many farmers could not accept it. Later, the method was changed, and farmers who lacked seedlings were mobilized to exchange seedlings for appropriate labor, fertilizer, cattle work, and seeds, and the work of adjusting seedlings was smoothly carried out.
    In the struggle to overcome natural disasters, agricultural scientific institutions and agricultural experts played a great role. When the continuous rain arrived, some farmers thought, "Heaven wants more rain, what can people do?" Bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying, "There is more rain this year because land reform has offended Grandma Linshui, and the heavy rain will not stop for three months." This rumor quickly spread from Gutian County to Nanping, Minhou, Fuzhou, and other places. Based on this situation, various places launched a rumor-refuting struggle. Comrades from the Meteorological Institute wrote articles on why it rains and why there is so much rain this year, and published them in the newspaper. As a result, the scientific knowledge of the farmers was increased, and the rumors of the special agents were effectively打击. After the flood occurred, many farmers estimated that the disaster situation was too serious, and obviously lost 60 to 70 percent, but they wanted to say that it was all flooded. The Provincial Farm timely invited professors from various agricultural colleges, local agricultural experts, and experienced old farmers to hold meetings and conducted actual investigations in the fields, accurately analyzed the disaster situation, researched methods of protecting seedlings, and published them continuously in the newspaper, which played a great guiding role. When the leaders proposed to save seedlings, farmers were generally afraid that fewer seedlings would be transplanted, and less grain would be harvested. The Provincial Farm immediately introduced their past experience of transplanting fewer seedlings and applying more fertilizer, which not only did not reduce production but also increased production, dispelling the farmers' concerns. Agricultural experts also gained a lot of practical knowledge in the struggle to rescue seedlings.
    When fighting against disasters, it is very important to make full and flexible use of various propaganda tools. After the flood occurred, Fujian Daily reported on the issue of rescuing seedlings in a relatively prominent manner, and published articles on the situation and methods of protecting seedlings in various places every day. However, because the inland transportation in Fujian is inconvenient, and newspapers cannot quickly reach the entire province, the newspaper closely cooperated with the radio station, and broadcast the important disaster relief papers, methods, experiences, and news of the masses rescuing floods on the radio station in a timely manner, and then the radio stations in various places mimeographed and distributed these materials, which played a role in the struggle at that time.

### 福建人民战胜水灾完成春耕插秧

　　福建人民战胜水灾完成春耕插秧
    本报特约记者　刘岳峰
    福建农民战胜严重的霪雨水灾，胜利完成今年的稻禾插秧工作。全省约一千六百余万亩稻田（总耕地面积为两千万亩），基本上未因水灾减少插秧面积，有的地方的插秧面积还增加了。
    福建省的稻作，分为早稻、晚稻（间作）与单季稻三种。其中早稻约稻作总量的百分之三十。早稻在三至四月播种，四至五月插秧，七月间陆续成熟，由南而北相继收割。早稻收成不好，就会发生春夏（晚稻收割前）灾荒，对农民的影响是十分重大的。今年的早稻种刚刚播下不久，就发生了三十几年来所少见的雨水灾害。从三月下旬到四月底，霪雨一直未停。绝大部分秧田均被淹没。闽江下游因江水登陆，受灾最重。福州市郊及闽侯等县的许多地方，变成一片汪洋，洪水数日不退。全省一般地区的秧苗被水泡烂和被水冲掉的，约在百分之三十至五十左右。闽江两岸秧苗损失重者达百分之八十，有些地区的稻秧全部被水冲掉了。
    灾情发生后，中共福建省委、福建省人民政府、省农民协会等领导机关，立即召开专门会议，讨论护秧工作，确定抢救秧苗（及抢收小麦）为当时压倒一切的中心任务。接着，各地农民就在中共地方党委、政府、农会和工作组的领导下动员起来，展开了空前紧张的排水、扶秧、洗秧（洗掉秧上沾的泥，以免秧苗卧地不起）及抢收小麦的运动。经过艰苦的努力，大大挽救了秧苗霉烂的程度，一般地区减轻了二、三成的损失。但是，当时秧苗仍是缺乏的。五月份以后广大农民又在共产党和人民政府的领导下，展开了广泛的节省与调剂秧苗的互助运动，及时克服了缺秧的困难。五月中旬前后，全省的早稻插秧已基本完成。从五月底到六月上、中旬，间作稻和单季晚稻也基本插完。至此，今年的春耕插秧工作即告胜利结束。
    灾情发生后，在广大群众中，一时曾产生了相当普遍的悲观情绪。受灾较重的闽侯县潘墩乡的农民说：“天为难，没法子想了。”有人说：“人民政府不会让我们饿死的，等救济吧。”在群众情绪混乱不安的时候，党政领导机关准确地掌握与分析了灾情（当时不少农民对灾情有夸大的情绪），及时指出方向，教育群众树立了战胜天灾的信心。闽侯专区的灾情发生后，中共地方委员会立即发出通知，号召各级党委立即全力领导群众救灾。各县分别召开了老农与积极分子会议，研究护秧的办法（办法想出后，火速通报各地仿行）。从专署到各县、各区的负责干部，大部深入群众中，领导群众紧急抢救。专署温附山、饶云山正、副专员，首先到灾情最重的地方，慰问灾民，并亲自和农民研究救灾的办法，大大鼓舞了农民的斗争情绪。该专区的缺秧问题，终于在全体党政军民的一致努力下，完满解决了。插秧以后，各地又发现了程度不同的春荒和虫害，而不少群众是存在消极与等待心理。顺昌县长、中共县委副书记及闽清县长等负责干部，立即深入群众，研究灾情，领导农民订立度荒计划，并亲自下田，领导群众捕虫。农民的生产除害情绪马上高涨起来，他们说：“县长亲自来领导了，哪有克服不了的困难！”
    为了战胜灾害，必须发动群众。把抗美援朝的爱国主义教育与战胜自然灾害的宣传密切结合起来，群众的信心提高，力量就特别强大了。福州市郊农民代表开会讨论抢救秧苗时，同时开展了控诉美、日、蒋、地主恶霸罪行的运动。代表们自动提出：为了不让美、蒋再来涂炭人民，增加抗美援朝的力量，我们一定要领导全郊区的农民，克服缺秧困难，继续争取丰收。我们以此为条件，向山西的李顺达互助组应战。闽西农民与水灾顽强斗争，有些地区，因秧苗霉烂，曾重新下种六、七次。闽侯一区农民提出的口号是：“抗水如抗美，救秧如援朝！”他们日夜不眠，在田里排水扶秧。潘墩乡寡妇林妹官嫂在土地改革中，分了二亩三分田。她说：“我一辈子没见过田契，现在自己可有田了，可得保住它。我要和水灾斗争，这也是抗美援朝啊。”洪水浸满了她的田，秧苗霉烂了。她用白天在碾米厂工作，和晚上给人家磨豆腐赚的米，换谷种重新播种。先后连播三次，终于战胜了天灾。
    为了战胜水灾，广大农民展开了史无前例的互助互济运动。过去一堆秧要插二十一株以上，今年许多农民普遍少插稻，有的一堆插十三株，有的插九株和十株，这就可以节省大量的秧苗，帮助缺秧的农民弟兄。在调剂秧苗时，不只进行了“天下农民是一家”的宣传，还特别照顾到自愿两利的原则。晋江县农民是有卖秧习惯的。当地领导机关最初提出互济秧苗的口号，许多农民不能接受。后来改变了办法，发动缺秧农民用适当的人工、肥料、牛工、种子调换秧苗，调剂秧苗的工作便顺利展开了。
    在战胜自然灾害的斗争中，农业科学机关和农业专家起了很大的作用。霪雨到来时，有的农民认为“这是老天要多雨，人有什么法子呢？”坏分子乘机造谣说：“今年雨水多，是土地改革得罪了临水奶奶，三个月大雨不会停。”这个谣言很快的从古田县传到南平、闽侯、福州等地。根据此一情况，各地展开了辟谣斗争。气象所同志写了为什么下雨及今年雨水为什么这样多的文章，在报上发表了。结果增加了农民的科学知识，有力的打击了特务的谣言。水灾发生后，许多农民估计灾情太严重，明明损失了六、七成，却要说成全部淹光了。省农场及时邀请了各农业专科学校的教授、当地的农业专家及有经验的老农开会，并下田实际调查，准确地分析了灾情，研究出护秧的办法，连续在报上发表，发挥了很大的指导作用。领导上提出节省秧本的时候，一般农民都怕少插了秧苗，会少打粮食。省农场立刻把他们过去少插秧，多施肥，不仅不减产，而且还能增产的经验介绍出来，解除了农民的顾虑。农业专家们也在抢救秧苗的斗争中，增进了不少的实际知识。
    在与灾害斗争的时候，充分而又灵活地运用各种宣传工具，是很重要的。此次水灾发生后，福建日报曾比较突出地报道了抢救秧苗问题，每天登载各地护秧的情况和办法的文章。但因福建内地交通不便，报纸不能迅速到达全省，所以报纸就和广播电台密切配合，把重要救灾的论文，办法，经验和群众抢救水灾的新闻，及时在广播电台上广播，再由各地的收音站把这些材料油印分发，对当时的斗争便发挥了作用。
