Xinhua News Agency, Cape Town, May 31st. Ten thousand people of all races in the Union of South Africa held an unprecedented torchlight parade in Cape Town on the evening of the 28th, angrily protesting the Malan government's increasingly intensified policy of racial discrimination. The demonstrators included people of all colors and nationalities who had come from all over the Union of South Africa, led by 50,000 veterans. They firmly expressed their opposition to the reactionary bill proposed by the Malan government, which was passed by parliament last month and deprived colored people of their existing limited voting rights. The procession of demonstrators was fifteen miles long. They marched through the city for four hours, holding aloft torches symbolizing victory and placards reading "Save the Constitution." On both sides of the streets through which the procession passed, there were three or four rows of people cheering on the demonstrators.

After the parade, the demonstrators held a protest rally in front of the parliament building. Air Force Colonel McLang, a veteran, spoke at the meeting, denouncing the Malan government's crimes of undermining the constitution and forcing the passage of despicable reactionary laws through parliament. He emphasized that those in power in South Africa today are the same people who prayed for Nazi victory yesterday. He called on the South African people to intensify their struggle against the Malan fascist dictatorship. The meeting also read out protest resolutions from various cities in Transvaal, Orange River, Natal, the eastern Cape Province, and Southwest Africa. These resolutions, especially the demand for the re-election of parliament, were warmly applauded by the participants. Afterwards, the demonstrators selected representatives to send these resolutions to the leaders of the opposition "United Party" in parliament.

The South African government dispatched a large number of armed police, densely deployed around the parliament building, attempting to prevent the people's representatives from entering parliament. The police wielded batons and brutally beat the masses, attempting to disperse the assembly, injuring dozens of demonstrators. However, they were never able to achieve their goal due to the unity and heroic resistance of all the demonstrators.

　　抗议反动政府的种族歧视政策
    南非十万人举行示威
    【新华社三十一日讯】开普敦讯，南非联邦各族十万人民于二十八日晚在开普敦举行了南非历史上规模空前的火炬大游行，愤怒地抗议马兰政府变本加厉地奉行种族歧视政策。参加示威的有从南非联邦各地赶来的各种肤色、各个民族的人民，而以五万名退伍军人为前导。他们坚决地表示反对议会于上月通过马兰政府所提出的剥夺有色人民现有的有限选举权的反动法案。示威者的行列长达十五里。他们高举象征着胜利的火炬和写着“拯救宪法”的标语牌，在全城游行达四小时之久。队伍所经过的街道两侧，都站有三四排人民为示威者助威。
    游行以后，示威者在议会门前举行了抗议大会。退伍军人空军上校麦朗在会上发言，痛斥马兰政府破坏宪法、强使议会通过卑污的反动法律的罪行。他强调指出：今天在南非当政的人正是昨天祈祷纳粹胜利的人。他号召南非人民为反对马兰法西斯独裁政权而加紧斗争。会上并宣读了来自德兰士瓦、橘河、纳塔尔、好望角省东部和西南非洲各城的抗议决议，这些决议，特别是改选议会的要求，受到与会群众的热烈欢呼。接着，示威者选派了代表把这些决议送交议会中反对派“统一党”的领袖们。
    南非政府派遣了大批武装警察密布在议会大厦四周，企图阻止人民代表进入议会。警察挥舞警棍，野蛮地殴打群众，企图冲散大会，他们打伤了好几十个示威者，但是在全体示威者团结和英勇抗击下，他们始终不能达到目的。
