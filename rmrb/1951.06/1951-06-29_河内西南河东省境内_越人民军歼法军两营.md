Xinhua News Agency, June 26th -- According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson for the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army announced at a press conference on the evening of the 20th that from the 17th to the 20th, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated two battalions of invading French troops in Hà Đông Province.

The battle took place in the liberated area behind enemy lines, more than ten kilometers southwest of Hà Nội, south of Vân Đình in Hà Đông Province. The French army reinforced twice in three days, deploying a total of ten battalions in an attempt to "mop up" the People's Army's base areas. However, the French army's offensive was crushed by the People's Army. Two of the French army's original bases were instead leveled by the People's Army. In addition to annihilating two battalions of enemy troops, the People's Army captured more than one hundred people and seized a large amount of military supplies.

During their retreat, the French army took barbaric retaliatory actions, burning houses and killing women and children along the way.

The spokesperson concluded by pointing out that this was the sixth time the invading French army had attacked this area, and the losses they suffered this time were greater than those suffered in the previous five failed offensives.

　　河内西南河东省境内
    越人民军歼法军两营
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总部发言人二十日晚在记者招待会中宣布：自十七日到二十日三天中，越南人民军在河东省歼灭了侵越法军两个营。
    战斗发生在河内西南十多公里、河东省云亭以南的敌后解放区一带。法军在三天中两次增援，共出动十个营的兵力，企图扫荡人民军的根据地。但结果，法军的攻势被人民军粉碎。法军原来的基地两处反被人民军荡平。人民军除歼灭了两营敌军外，并俘虏了一百多人，缴获了大量军火。
    法军在撤退中采取野蛮的泄愤行为，沿途焚烧房屋和杀害妇女和儿童。
    发言人最后指出：这次是侵越法军进攻该地区的第六次，他们这次受到的损失比前五次的失败攻势所受到的损失更大。
