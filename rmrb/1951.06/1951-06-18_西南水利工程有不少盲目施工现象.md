　　According to the Southwest Water Conservancy Department's spring work inspection report, blind construction in water conservancy projects is very serious. For example, the People's Canal in Yunnan was planned to involve 10,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work, but actual measurements show it requires 40,000 cubic meters, a fourfold difference. The reinforced concrete bridge designed for the Huahui Canal in Yunnan was found during construction to have already existed for two years. Furthermore, the canal's hasty construction resulted in workers crowding together in a disorganized manner, severely impacting work efficiency. Another example is the Jinning Pumping Project in Yunnan, which was originally intended to pass through Jinsha Grass Lake; later, it was discovered that the lakebed was full of sludge, forcing the relocation of the inspection site northward. Moreover, the project is huge, and its future economic benefits are still questionable. As for the Zhougong Canal in Xikang, the local responsible officials initially insisted on starting construction early, but this was not approved. This inspection revealed that the original plan was very incomplete and unusable, and the project cost was also very high. Another instance is the construction of the Yuanyang Dam in Kangding. Initially, it was not approved due to the lack of design drawings. Later, emphasizing consideration for the interests of ethnic minorities, it was approved by higher authorities to start construction. However, after the funds were allocated, it was discovered that the dam was entirely composed of coarse sand and pebbles, making it impossible to build an earthen dam in the irrigated area, leading to a request to halt the project. This shows that no one had visited the construction site beforehand. Such practices are very harmful to the progress of basic construction.

### 西南水利工程有不少盲目施工现象

　　西南水利工程有不少盲目施工现象
    据西南水利部春工检查汇报，水利工程中盲目施工现象甚为严重。如云南的人民渠，计划土石方一万方，经实际测量则需四万方，相差四倍。云南华惠渠设计中的钢筋混泥水桥，在施工时才发现该桥二年前就有了；且该渠伧促施工，民工挤在一起，乱做一团，工作效率很差。又如云南晋宁抽水工程，原拟穿过金沙草湖；后来才发现湖底尽是浠泥，只得把检验位置又移向北边。但该项工程巨大，而且将来的经济效益如何也还是问题。在西康的周公渠，当地有关负责人原来坚持提前动工，未被核准；这次检查才发现原计划很不完备，根本不能用，且工程费也很浩大。其次如康定鸳鸯坝施工一事，初因无设计图表未被批准，后来强调照顾少数民族利益，才经上级同意先行动工。但款拨出后才发现该坝全系粗砂卵石，灌区无法修土坝，乃呈请停办；可见事先根本没有去施工地区看过。这样的做法对基本建设的进行，是非常有害的。
