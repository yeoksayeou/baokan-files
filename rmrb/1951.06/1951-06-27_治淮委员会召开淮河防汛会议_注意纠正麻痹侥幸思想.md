　　The Huai River Commission Convenes a Huai River Flood Prevention Meeting
    Pay Attention to Correcting Complacency and Wishful Thinking
    With the flood season of the Huai River approaching, the Huai River Commission convened a Huai River flood prevention meeting in Bengbu from the 11th to the 14th of this month. More than 50 representatives from the three provinces along the Huai River—Henan, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu—attended the meeting. The meeting discussed issues such as the organizational leadership of flood prevention work on the Huai River, ensuring the completion of tasks, and planning for flood prevention materials. The meeting believed that the flood prevention leading organs along the Huai River this year should especially pay attention to correcting the complacent thinking of some cadres and the masses who believe that "spring repairs have just been carried out, the project is solid, and there will be no problems," and the wishful thinking that "there was a major flood last year, and there may not be another major flood this year." All levels of flood prevention organizations must earnestly prepare for the fight against floods with the resolute spirit of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and effectively carry out flood prevention work. Regarding the preparation of flood prevention materials, the meeting decided that some would be resolved by the people in the areas along the Huai River themselves, and some would be subsidized by the People's Government. The meeting made specific regulations regarding the designated water levels and flood reporting methods for the main and tributary streams of the Huai River, as well as the inspection and patrol of embankments during the flood season.
    Currently, the Huai River Flood Prevention Headquarters, which unifies the leadership of flood prevention work on the Huai River, has been established in Bengbu, and the flood prevention organizations of provinces and special districts along the Huai River are also being established one after another.

　　治淮委员会召开淮河防汛会议
    注意纠正麻痹侥幸思想
    淮河洪水汛期即将到来，治淮委员会特于本月十一日至十四日在蚌埠召开淮河防汛会议。出席会议的有河南、皖北、苏北等三个沿淮河省区的代表五十多人。会议讨论了关于淮河防汛工作的组织领导、保证完成任务和筹划防汛器材等问题。会议认为：今年淮河的防汛领导机关应特别注意纠正部分干部和群众认为“刚刚进行过春修，工程牢固，不会发生问题”的麻痹思想，和认为“去年刚发过大水，今年可能不会再发大水”的侥幸心理。各级防汛机构必须认真以抗美援朝的坚决精神来准备和洪水作斗争，切实作好防汛工作。关于防汛器材的准备问题，会议决定一部分由沿淮河各地人民自己解决，一部分由人民政府补助。关于淮河干支流的设防水位和报汛办法，以及防汛期中的检查和巡逻堤防等制度，会议均作了具体的规定。
    现在，统一领导淮河防汛工作的淮河防汛总指挥部已在蚌埠成立，沿淮河各省区及专区的防汛组织亦正在相继建立中。
