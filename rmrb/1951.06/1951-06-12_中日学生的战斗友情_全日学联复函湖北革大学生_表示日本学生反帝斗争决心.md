　　The Fighting Friendship Between Chinese and Japanese Students
    All-Japan Student Federation Replies to Hubei Revolutionary University Students
    Expressing Japanese Students' Determination to Fight Imperialism
    The entire student body of the Second Department of Hubei People's Revolutionary University wrote a letter on February 17th opposing the American arming of Japan, and asked the All-Japan Student Autonomy Association to forward it to students across Japan. They recently received a reply from the Central Executive Committee of the All-Japan Student Autonomy Association. The reply stated:

    We Japanese students received your letter from a faraway place, and we are extremely grateful and encouraged.

    Due to the American imperialists' attempt to re-arm Japan, our economic lives have been severely affected. We have also suffered brutal suppression and persecution in terms of speech, thought, and other political activities. We live in a situation of "five yuan a month, one meal a day," and many students are forced to sell on the streets, and even have to sell their blood, in order to barely maintain their lives and pay expensive tuition fees. Under these circumstances, schools are also closing one after another.

    In Japan, progressive professors have been expelled from schools. Labor organizations were also disbanded last autumn, and many progressive workers are wandering the streets unable to survive.

    On the other hand, last September, American imperialism, under the guise of "maintaining Japan's security" and "defending against foreign aggression," armed 75,000 "Police Reserve Forces." These are entirely composed of former Japanese army and navy officers and non-commissioned officers. Japanese Attorney General Ohashi even proposed to the Diet to recruit former students of the Japanese Military Academy and Naval Academy to serve as cadres of the reserve forces.

    Arming the "Police Reserve Force" is the first step in rebuilding the Japanese fascist army, and today, no one in Japan doubts this.

    In addition, in order to solve the problem of barracks for the "Police Reserve Force," nearly thirty schools across the country have been occupied. Recently, the United States, under the pretext of "preventing foreign aggression against Japan," has sent two divisions of troops and even more fiercely occupied our schools.

    We deeply realize that rearming Japan and turning Japan into a military base is a preparation for attacking New China and the Soviet Union, and for using force to suppress the national liberation struggles of Asian colonies and dependent countries. We, the Japanese people and students, will never allow the history of invading other countries and slaughtering other nations to be repeated, and we will do our utmost to stop it.

    We Japanese students are determined not to be mercenaries of aggressors and will never be their slaves.

    Japanese students must unite with the Soviet Union, New China, and all peace-loving people and nations and work together!

    Now, Japanese students, youth, and all the people are strengthening internal unity and constantly struggling against a separate peace treaty and the rearming of Japan, striving to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty quickly in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation, and to withdraw the occupying forces. We also hope that you, comrades, will give us your greatest support and assistance.

　　中日学生的战斗友情         
    全日学联复函湖北革大学生   
    表示日本学生反帝斗争决心
    【新华社汉口十一日电】湖北人民革命大学第二部全体学生曾在二月十七日为反对美国武装日本写了一封信请全日本学生自治会联合会转给日本全国学生，最近他们收到了全日本学生自治会联合会中央执行委员会的复信。复信说：
    我们日本学生接到你们从遥远的地方寄来的信，我们万分地感激和得到了鼓励。
    由于美帝国主义企图重新武装日本，我们的经济的生活受到严重影响。在言论上、思想上，和其他的政治活动上也遭受了残暴的镇压和迫害。我们生活在“月薪五元，每日一餐”的情况下，很多的学生被迫在街头叫卖，甚至必须出卖自己的血液，才能勉强维持生活和缴纳昂贵的学费。在这种情况下，学校也相继关门。
    在日本，进步的教授，被逐出了学校。工人组织在去年秋天也给解散了，很多的进步工人流浪在街头不能生活下去。
    另一方面在去年九月，美帝国主义又假借“维持日本的治安”“防御外国侵略”的名义，武装了七万五千名“警察后备队”。其中完全是旧日本陆海军的将校和下级军官，日本法务总裁大桥并出面向国会提出，要征募日本陆军士官学校和海军学校的旧有学生来充任预备队的干部。
    武装“警察预备队”是重建日本法西斯军队的第一步，在今天，这是日本人民谁都不会怀疑的了。
    另外为了解决“警察预备队”的兵营，全国将近三十所校舍被霸占了，最近美国并且以“防止外力侵略日本”为借口开来了二个师团的军队，更凶狠地强占了我们的校舍。
    我们深深地认识到，重新武装日本，和日本军事基地化是进攻新中国和苏联，和用武力来镇压亚洲殖民地、附属国的民族解放斗争的准备。我们日本人民和学生，再也不容许侵略别国、残杀其他民族的历史重演，我们当以最大的努力来制止它。
    我们日本学生坚决不作侵略者的雇佣兵和绝不做他们的奴隶。
    日本学生要和苏联、新中国以及一切爱好和平的人民和民族团结起来携手并进！
    现在，日本学生、青年，和全体人民正加强内部的团结，不断地在为反对单独媾和，重新武装日本而斗争，争取遵照波茨坦公告，迅速地缔结全面和约，和撤退占领军。更希望同学们，给我们最大的支持和援助。
