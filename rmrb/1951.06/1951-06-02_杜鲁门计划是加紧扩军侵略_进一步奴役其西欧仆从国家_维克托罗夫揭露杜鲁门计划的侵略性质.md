　　Truman's Plan Intensifies Aggressive Expansion of Armaments
    Further Enslaving its Western European Vassal States
    Viktorov Exposes the Aggressive Nature of the Truman Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 28th] 《Pravda》 commentator Viktorov calls Truman's new message to Congress requesting an appropriation of $8.5 billion for the so-called "Mutual Security Program" a plan to raise funds for aggression. Viktorov said: These funds will be allocated as follows: "Military Aid": $6.25 billion, "Economic Aid": $2.25 billion. However, an analysis of the so-called economic assistance reveals its military nature, because, according to Truman, it is mainly for the production of strategic materials to meet military needs. Direct "military aid" is used for war production, that is, to further intensify the arms expansion movement.
    Viktorov pointed out that Truman still adheres to his usual policy. On the one hand, he makes many false guarantees, saying that he is fully willing to peacefully resolve various disputes. On the other hand, he tries his best to carry out slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries and peoples. When Truman is clamoring about his imagined most aggressive Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, he certainly cannot produce any evidence. However, his plan once again convincingly proves that his war preparation plan is aimed at the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies, at the People's Republic of China, and at the people of Korea, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and other countries who are fighting for freedom and independence.
    Viktorov continued: The purpose of the Truman Plan is to further enslave the Marshallized and Americanized countries. Truman openly warned that rearmament would seriously deplete Western European countries. It is not difficult to see that Truman's plan is to completely stifle the civilian industries of Western European countries and use the Western European market to sell American inventory, and of course, American weapons and equipment. Truman also said in the message that he would first "aid" the Chiang Kai-shek clique who fled to Taiwan and the troops fighting against the Vietnamese people. This part of the message very clearly proves the strong aggressive nature of the Truman Plan. The plan also stipulates the appropriation for the war against the Korean people. Viktorov concluded: The Truman Plan is a plan to further expand the US aggressive policy.

　　杜鲁门计划是加紧扩军侵略
    进一步奴役其西欧仆从国家
    维克托罗夫揭露杜鲁门计划的侵略性质
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：《真理报》评论家维克托罗夫把杜鲁门向国会提出的请求为所谓“共同安全计划”拨款八十五亿美元的新咨文称为为侵略筹措资金的计划。维克托罗夫说：这些款项将作如下分配——“军事援助”：六十二亿五千万元，“经济援助”：二十二亿五千万元。但是，把所谓经济援助分析一下就可以看出它的军事性质来，因为，据杜鲁门解释，它主要是为了生产战略物资以应付军事需要。直接的“军事援助”则用来进行战争生产，也就是，进一步加紧扩张军备运动。
    维克托罗夫指出：杜鲁门仍固守他平素的政策，他一方面提出许多虚伪的保证，说他完全愿意和平解决各种争端，另一方面又竭力对苏联及其他爱好和平的国家和民族进行诽谤性的攻击。杜鲁门在大肆叫嚣他所想像的苏联及其他爱好和平国家最有侵略性时，当然举不出一个证据来。然而他的计划却再度令人信服地证明了：他的备战计划是针对着苏联及欧洲人民民主国家的，是针对着中华人民共和国，针对着朝鲜、越南、缅甸、马来亚及其他为争取自由与独立而战的人民的。
    维克托罗夫接着说：杜鲁门计划的目的在进一步奴役马歇尔化及美国化的国家。杜鲁门公开地警告说：重整军备将严重地消耗西欧国家。不难看出：杜鲁门的计划是要完全扼杀西欧国家的民用工业并利用西欧市场出售美国的存货，自然，也出售美国的武器及装备。杜鲁门在咨文中还说：首先他将“援助”逃往台湾的蒋介石集团以及对越南人民作战的部队。咨文的这一部分非常清楚地证明了杜鲁门计划的强烈的侵略性质。计划中还规定了用于反对朝鲜人民的战争的拨款。维克托罗夫结语说：杜鲁门计划是进一步扩大美国侵略政策的计划。
