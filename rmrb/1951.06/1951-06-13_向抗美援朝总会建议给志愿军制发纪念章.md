　　Suggestion to the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association to Issue Medals to the Chinese People's Volunteers:
    To the Editor:
    Having recently heard the reports from the delegates of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, we learned that the Volunteer Army soldiers greatly welcome the souvenirs brought from the motherland, especially the five-star medals with Chairman Mao's image. This fully demonstrates the sincere and profound feelings of the Volunteer Army soldiers' love for the motherland. It is a pity that the delegation brought too few medals to satisfy the needs of the vast number of soldiers. Therefore, we suggest that the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association design and manufacture a Chinese People's Volunteer Army medal and issue it to the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. This will be a precious souvenir of our people's struggle against imperialism.
                                 China Academy of Sciences Central District Learning Committee

　　向抗美援朝总会建议给志愿军制发纪念章编辑同志：
    最近听到中国人民赴朝慰问团代表们的报告，知道志愿军战士们非常欢迎从祖国带去的纪念物，特别是有毛主席像的五星纪念章。这件事充分表示了志愿军战士们热爱祖国的诚挚而深厚的感情。可惜慰问团带去的纪念章太少了，无法满足广大战士的要求。因此，我们建议中国人民抗美援朝总会设计制造一种中国人民志愿军纪念章，发给志愿军的指战员。这将是我国人民反对帝国主义斗争中的一个珍贵的纪念品。
