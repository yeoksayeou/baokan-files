　　Because of the Party and Chairman Mao, I Have What I Have Today
    I Will Fulfill the Study Task Assigned to Me by the Party
    —A Letter from Model Worker Li Fenglian

Respected Chairman Mao:

　　As we welcome the great festival of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Party, I am writing this letter to you. Because I feel I am so happy and so cheerful now, it is under the education and cultivation of the Party and under your wise leadership that I have what I have today.

　　Please allow me to express my gratitude to the Party and to you with all my heart. A person like me, whose grandfather starved to death, whose maternal grandmother and mother also starved to death, such a poor child, in the old society, before participating in the revolution, what could I have hoped for? At the age of eight, because my father owed money to the landlord, I had no choice but to be forced to become a child bride to a paralyzed son of that landlord. Whether in winter or summer, I could only wear old sheepskin, eat wild vegetables, and sleep on the ground, and I was subjected to all kinds of vicious beatings by my mother-in-law. When I was so abused that I wanted to die twice but couldn't, what could I have hoped for?

　　But the Red Army came. When I first heard the Party's propagandists say that mothers-in-law cannot beat their daughters-in-law and that everyone should have enough to eat, I was truly amazed. Could it be that people can eat without being beaten? But it was from this moment that I slowly understood that there was hope for people to live. I found my savior, I joined the revolution. Respected Chairman Mao, this is the beginning of the new life that you and the Party have brought me!

　　I have worked as a cook and a communication员, and I have also worked in clothing factories and printing factories. Whenever I think of how miserable and abused I was in the past, but now I am working so freely and happily, I don't feel tired or feel that any difficulty can overwhelm me. Usually, an apprenticeship in a printing factory takes a year and a half to complete, but I finished it in eight months. I also initiated production competitions with many comrades, and I also participated in land reclamation. I always feel that the Party has given me too much, and I should put as much effort as I can into my work. I always feel that a person like me, who was rescued from the fire pit by the revolution and the Party, an ordinary person with no culture at all, should do everything in my power to work more for the Party and for the revolution. At this time, I was elected as a labor model, and I deeply feel that this glory should be attributed to the Communist Party, you, and the broad masses of working people.

　　When I think of being elected as a delegate to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in 1946, and participating in the takeover of factories in Shenyang in 1948 as a military representative, especially when I participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, I feel that all of this would have been impossible without the Party's long-term education and cultivation of me. I remember the day the CPPCC meeting opened, when I saw you, I was so happy that I didn't know what to do. That night, I couldn't sleep all night. Respected Chairman Mao! You are so healthy, you bring infinite light and happiness to the people of the whole country, especially to me.

　　Under the education of the Party, I have made a lot of progress myself; but I have shortcomings. When I had not participated in the revolution, I did not recognize a single character, and I did not even recognize the codes for recording numbers, let alone how to add or subtract. Therefore, I could only draw long and short marks to keep accounts, which caused me many difficulties in my work. When I thought of everything I saw in the Soviet Union the year before was so wonderful, and when I thought that I was a Party member and had to strive for the realization of socialist and communist society, I felt that I should step up to improve myself. It was at this time (1950) that the Party sent me to study at a new type of university in the country - Renmin University. At the beginning of my studies, because of my low level of education, I encountered difficulties in learning theory. In order to solve this problem, the school established a cultural remedial class, and I participated in this remedial class to study culture. In the past year, I have completed arithmetic, and I will study algebra next. I can already read newspapers, documents, and novels, and I can roughly write some of the things I want to write. I am beginning to feel that my horizons are wider. Under the cultivation of the Party, I firmly believe that I can master science and technology and complete all the tasks of learning.

　　Respected Chairman Mao! I fully understand that without the Party, I would have nothing. Today, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of our Party, when the people of the whole country are working hard for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform, I assure you: I will complete all the tasks assigned to me by the Party!

### 有党和毛主席我才有了今天  我要完成党给我的学习任务——劳动模范李凤莲的信

专栏：

　　有党和毛主席我才有了今天
    我要完成党给我的学习任务
    ——劳动模范李凤莲的信敬爱的毛主席：
    在迎接党成立三十周年的伟大节日的时候，我给您写这封信。因为我觉得自己现在太幸福、太快活，我在党的教育、培养和在您的英明的领导之下，才有了今天。
    请让我向您用整个的心说出我对党和您的感谢。像我这样的一个人，祖父是挨饿死了，外祖母和母亲也都挨饿死了，这样的一个苦孩子，在旧社会里，在没有参加革命的时候，我能希望一些什么呢？我八岁上因为父亲欠地主的钱，不得不被逼童养给那地主的一个瘫了的儿子。无论冬夏我只能穿着老羊皮，吃着野菜，睡在地上，还要挨尽了婆婆的各式各样的毒打。当我在被虐待得两次想死又死不成的时候，我能希望一些什么呢？
    但是红军来了，当我第一次听到党的宣传员讲到婆婆不能打媳妇、每个人都应该吃饱饭的时候，我真有些惊奇。难道人不挨打也可以吃饭吗？但也就是从这个时候起，我慢慢懂得人活着原来有希望。我找到了救星，我参加了革命。敬爱的毛主席，这就是您和党给我带来的新生命的开始！
    我做过炊事员、通信员，我也在被服厂和印刷厂里做过工。我一想到过去自己是那么苦，那么受虐待，这时却是这么自由地快活地工作着，我就觉不到什么是疲倦，觉不到有什么困难可以压倒我。照例在印刷厂做学徒要一年半满期，我是八个月就学完了。我还和许多同志们发动过生产竞赛，也参加过开荒。我总觉得党给我的是太多了，我应当有多大力量就拿出多大力量来工作。我总觉得像我这样一个被革命、被党从火坑里救起来的人，一个完全没有文化的平凡的人，是应当尽我一切的能力为党为革命更多地工作的。我这时候被选为劳动模范，我深深感觉到这光荣是应该归于共产党和您及广大劳动人民的。
    我一想到一九四六年我被选为陕甘宁边区的参议员，一九四八年以军事代表资格在沈阳参加工厂的接管工作，特别是一九四九年我参加了全国人民政治协商会议，我就觉得如果不是党给我的长期的教育和培植，这一切完全是不可能的。记得人民政协开会的那一天，当我看到您的时候，我真高兴得不知怎么才好。那天夜里，我一整夜睡不着。敬爱的毛主席！您是那么健康，您给全国人民特别是我带来了无限光明和幸福。
    我在党的教育下自己有很多的长进；但我是有缺点的。当我没有参加革命的时候，我一个字都不识，我连记数目字的字码也不认识，更不懂得怎样加，怎样减，因此，我只能画长短记号来记账，这使我在工作中遇到了不少困难。我一想到前年我在苏联看到的一切都是那么美好，一想到自己是个党员，要为社会主义和共产主义社会的实现来奋斗，我就觉得应该加紧提高自己。就在这个时候（一九五○年），党把我送进了全国新型的大学——人民大学来学习。开始学习时，因为我文化水平低，学习理论遇到了困难。校方为了解决这个问题，成立了一个文化补习班，我就参加这补习班学习文化。一年以来，我已学完了算术，再下去就要学代数。我已经可以看报，看文件和小说，并且能粗浅地写一些我要写的东西，我开始感到我的眼界是更加宽广了。在党的培植之下，我坚信我能掌握科学和技术，完成一切学习的任务。
    敬爱的毛主席！我完全懂得没有党就没有我的一切。今天，当我们党成立三十周年的时候，当全国人民为抗美援朝、镇压反革命和土地改革而努力奋斗的时候，我向您保证：我将完成党所给我的一切任务！ 
     李凤莲
