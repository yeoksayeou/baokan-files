The Image of the Working People Should Not Be Distorted!
    Hua Junwu
    Review of the book "The Story of Wu Xun" (Edited by Li Shizhao, Illustrated by Sun Zhijun)

    The illustrator of "The Story of Wu Xun," Sun Zhijun, wrote in the preface to the picture album: "Today, the people's government's policy on literature and art is 'serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers,' praising the people's combat heroes and model laborers. Wu Xun is a concrete representative figure of a peasant labor model in modern Chinese history." Whether Wu Xun is "a concrete representative figure of a peasant labor model" has been discussed in many articles, and I will not talk about it here. Now we can take a look at how Sun Zhijun portrays our working people? In this album, the peasants, barbers, and construction workers are mostly ugly in appearance, with small braids and horn-shaped buns; drooping eight-character eyebrows (this is a common feature added by the painter to the working people), flat noses; bare chests, wearing leggings; thin and always bent legs, below which are a pair of large and clumsy feet. The expressions of these characters make people feel that they are stupid, cowardly, and cunning.

    In the painter's pen, peasant women also have a common characteristic: slicked-back hair, with ingot buns turned outwards at both ends; sparse bangs, flying painted eyebrows, evil eyes under the eyelashes; bloated bellies, protruding buttocks, forming a clumsy and deformed body pressed on curved and thin calves; looking further down, the painter uses a very appreciative tone to depict various shapes of pointed and delicate small feet on each woman. These women are painted as extremely indecent women. All this is the working people in Sun Zhijun's pen.

    How does the painter portray the image of the landlords? In the picture album, there is the dignified Jinshi Lou (Figure 40); Yang Shufang and Guo Fen, who occupy a dominant position and stature on the screen and appear majestic (Figures 46 and 50); the fair-faced Guo Fen (Figure 50); the fair-featured Imperial Envoy (please note that the drooping eight-character eyebrows have disappeared) (Figure 66); the benevolent government official crossing his legs (Figure 74); those stupid, cowardly, and cunning expressions are completely gone in the painter's pen.

    From these images, it is not difficult for us to see whether Sun Zhijun's thoughts and feelings are oriented towards the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or towards the landlord class?

    Can it be said that this is the image of the great Chinese working people? This is an insult to our working people; can it also be said that this is Chairman Mao's literary and art policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers"? This is a distortion of our literary and art policy! The working people must not be insulted, and the literary and art policy must not be distorted. Despite the preface written with progressive slogans, it still cannot cover up these bad pictures.

    Then someone will ask, if the image of the working people in this picture album is not ugly, is it "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers"? I think that even if the image of the people is upright in appearance, but if it does not express the strong, brave, wise, and diligent qualities of the working people from the essence, and only cares about the pleasing appearance, and deviates from the principle of educating the people, and therefore cannot truly improve the people's ideological awareness, then the problem of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers" still cannot be solved. The decisive factor is still the painter's standpoint, viewpoint, and ideological problem, not a technical problem. Because the viewpoints, standpoints, and thoughts of the painter Sun Zhijun and the editor Li Shizhao are consistent, they both stand on the position of praising the supporter of feudalism—Wu Xun. Therefore, even if there are some modifications and changes in image or technology, it will still be of no avail. Under the control of wrong ideas, if the painter has superb skills, it will only play a greater poisonous role.

　　不应歪曲劳动人民的形象！
    华君武
    评《武训画传》（李士钊编·孙之俊画）的图书
    《武训画传》的画者孙之俊在画传的序文上写着：“今天人民政府的文艺政策是‘面向工农兵’，表扬人民的战斗英雄和劳动模范，武训正是中国近代历史上的一个农民劳动模范的具体代表人物。”武训是否是“一个农民劳动模范的具体代表人物”已经有许多文章讨论过，我在这里就不谈了。现在可以来看看孙之俊在如何地表现我们的劳动人民呢？在这本画册中的农民、理发师、建筑工人大都是面貌丑陋，垂着小辫和梳着角髻；倒挂着八字眉（这是画者给劳动人民加上的一种普遍特征），塌着鼻子；打着赤膊，穿着套裤；细长而永远弯曲着的腿的下边，是一双大而笨重的脚，这些人物的神情使人感到是愚蠢、懦弱而带着狡猾。
    农民妇女在画者的笔下，也是有着一种共同的特征的：梳着油光的头发，两端外翘着元宝髻；疏疏的前留海，飞扬的画眉，睫毛下的邪眼；臃肿的肚子，凸出的臀部，形成粗笨畸形的身子压在弯曲而瘦弱的小腿上；再往下看，画者用着万分欣赏的笔调在每个妇女身上描绘各种形状的尖细的小脚。这些妇女被画成极其不正派的女人。这一切就是孙之俊笔下的劳动人民。
    画者对于地主的形象又是如何地描写呢？画传里有着态度端庄的娄进士（第四十图）；在画面上所占地位和身材都占优势而显得威风的杨树芳和郭芬（第四十六图、第五十图）；面貌端正的郭芬（第五十图）；五官端正的钦差（请注意倒挂的八字眉都不存在了）（第六十六图）；施善政跷着腿（第七十四图）；那些愚蠢、懦弱和狡猾的神情，在画者的笔下溜得个一干二净。
    从这些形象中，我们也就不难看出，孙之俊的思想感情是面向着工农兵呢？还是面向着地主阶级？
    难道可以说，这是伟大的中国劳动人民的形象么？这是对我们劳动人民的污辱；难道也可以说，这是毛主席的“面向工农兵”的文艺政策么？这是对我们文艺政策的歪曲！劳动人民不容污辱，文艺政策不容歪曲，尽管写着进步口号的序文，还是不能掩盖这些恶劣的图画的。
    那么有人要问，如果这本画传中，劳动人民的形象没有被丑化，是否就是“面向工农兵”了呢？我想即使人民的形象在外表上端正，但是如果没有从本质上去表现劳动人民的坚强、勇敢、智慧、勤劳的品质，只顾形象的顺眼，而离开了教育人民的原则，因而不能真正提高人民的思想觉悟，那么仍然不能解决“面向工农兵”的问题。起决定作用的还是画者的立场、观点、思想问题，而不是技术问题。由于画者孙之俊和编者李士钊的观点、立场、思想是一致的，他们都是站在赞扬封建主义的拥护者——武训的立场，因此即使在形象上或技术上有了某些修饰和改变，也还是无济于事的。在错误思想支配下，画者假设有了高明的技术，也只有起着更大的毒害作用。
