To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China, the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on June 15, requiring all provincial and municipal Party committees under its jurisdiction to organize all cadres and workers to conduct a general inspection of the implementation of the Trade Union Law from the end of June to the end of July, and to further study the Trade Union Law during the inspection. The instructions pointed out that although the implementation of the Trade Union Law in the Northwest region has achieved great results in the past year, many local Party committees have not been forceful enough in leading the implementation of the Trade Union Law, resulting in many problems in the implementation of the Trade Union Law. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, it is of great significance to conduct a general inspection and study of the Trade Union Law, so that the ideology of cadres at all levels relying on the working class can be further clarified and consolidated. The instructions said: During the inspection, the focus should be on checking democratic management, production, labor protection and welfare, labor-capital consultation meetings and collective contracts, as well as the construction of grassroots trade unions, and the payment and management of trade union funds. During the inspection, we must humbly listen to the opinions of the workers and the relevant parties, hold forums with both public and private parties, and labor and capital parties, as well as forums with advanced production teams and veteran technicians, or conduct individual interviews to understand the situation, identify problems, and summarize experiences. Problems found during the inspection that urgently need to be resolved should be studied and resolved immediately. Behaviors that violate the Trade Union Law should be criticized and educated, and those with serious circumstances should be given appropriate punishment. The instructions require responsible comrades of the Party Committee to take time to personally report on the Trade Union Law to the workers to mobilize the workers to do a good job in production and supervise the administration or the capitalists to implement the Trade Union Law.

    The Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions respectively instructed the Party committees and trade unions at all levels under their jurisdiction to check the implementation of the Trade Union Law. The instructions of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the implementation of the Trade Union Law in the Southwest region has achieved some results, which has enabled the workers' enthusiasm for production to be brought into play, the workers' lives have been considerably improved, and the workers have become more supportive of the Communist Party and the People's Government. However, the implementation of the Trade Union Law is still far from enough: for example, some urban Party committees and enterprise Party committees have not seriously studied the Trade Union Law; some administrative personnel in factories and mines ignore the provisions of the Trade Union Law; and some trade union cadres are not good at using the Trade Union Law as the basis for their work and resolutely protecting the interests of the working class. To this end, Party committees at all levels should focus on checking the implementation of the policy of relying on the working class, the leadership of the workers' movement, and how to implement the Party's resolutions through the administrative management system and mass organizations in July.
    The instructions of the Southwest Office of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions specifically require trade unions at all levels to first organize trade union cadres and members to study the Trade Union Law at the beginning of the inspection. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　纪念党的生日和工会法颁布一周年
    西北局指示所属党委普遍检查工会法执行情况
    西南局和全总西南办事处指示认真学习工会法
    中共中央西北局为庆祝中国共产党诞生三十周年和中华人民共和国工会法颁布一周年，于六月十五日发出指示，要求所属各省、市党委自六月下旬起至七月底止，组织所有干部和职工普遍检查一次工会法的执行情况，并在检查中进一步学习工会法。指示中指出：一年来，西北各地执行工会法虽已获很大成绩，但仍有不少地方党委对贯彻执行工会法的领导不够有力，以致工会法的贯彻执行还有不少问题存在。当此工会法颁布一周年之际，普遍进行一次关于工会法的检查与学习，使各级干部依靠工人阶级的思想得以进一步明确和巩固，是有其重大意义的。指示说：在检查时，应以检查民主管理、生产情况、劳保福利、劳资协商会议和集体合同以及工会基层建设、工会经费交纳管理等为主。检查时，要虚心听取工人群众和各有关方面的意见，分别召开公私双方和劳资双方的座谈会以及先进生产小组、老技术工人的座谈会，或进行个别谈话，借以了解情况，找出问题，总结经验。检查发现的问题，迫切需要解决者应即研究解决。对于违犯工会法的行为，应进行批评教育，其情节严重者应给予适当处分。指示要求党委负责同志应抽出时间亲自向工人群众作工会法的报告，以发动工人群众搞好生产，监督行政或资方贯彻执行工会法。（新华社）
    中共中央西南局及中华全国总工会西南办事处分别指示所属各级党委和工会检查工会法执行情形。中共中央西南局的指示指出：西南各地执行工会法已有一些成绩，因而使工人的生产热情得以发挥，工人的生活也得到了相当改善，工人对共产党及人民政府也就更加拥护。但工会法的贯彻执行还是很不够的：如有些城市党委与企业党委还未认真学习过工会法；有些厂矿企业行政人员还忽视工会法的规定；有些工会干部还不善于以工会法作为进行工作的依据，坚决保护工人阶级的利益。为此，各级党委应在七月份内着重检查依靠工人阶级的方针的贯彻情形，对工人运动的领导的情形，以及如何通过行政管理系统及群众团体实现党的决议等。
    中华全国总工会西南办事处的指示特别要求各级工会于检查开始时首先组织工会干部和会员学习工会法。（新华社）
