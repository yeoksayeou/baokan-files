Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, delivered a speech at the meeting, and reported that Li Xijiu, a member of the Central Committee, despite being ill, had not forgotten to make donations and was willing to donate a book of Mi Nan Gong's calligraphy, which he treasured most, for auction. Long Yun stated in his speech that he and his wife, Gu Yingqiu, had decided to donate their two large houses in Kunming, totaling more than 100 rooms (estimated by local democratic appraisal to be worth about 1 billion yuan), and that he himself would donate an additional 20 million yuan in cash. Hu Shuhua and Wang Baozhen both declared at the meeting that they would donate one-tenth of their monthly salary until the victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea War; Hu Shuhua also stated that he would organize his lecture notes during the summer vacation and donate all the royalties. Wu Jiaxiang, Zhang Xuwen, Zhao Zhongyu, and others also successively pledged donations on the spot. Finally, Jiang Guangnai announced that, in addition to the 10 million yuan he had previously pledged, he would donate two houses in South China, one purchased with 30,000 silver dollars before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the other slightly smaller, currently valued at about 100 million yuan; he would donate the larger house entirely and half of the smaller house. As of now, the initial donation target of 1.5 billion yuan proposed by the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang has been exceeded within five days. The Donation General Association of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang is now considering the second donation target.
