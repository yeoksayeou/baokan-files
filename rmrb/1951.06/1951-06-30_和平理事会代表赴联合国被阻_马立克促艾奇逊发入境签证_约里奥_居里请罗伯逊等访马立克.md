Xinhua News Agency, June 29th dispatch: TASS, New York, June 29th—Soviet representative to the United Nations and President of the Security Council for June, Malik, sent the following telegram to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on June 27th:
Washington, Mr. Secretary of State Acheson:

　　The President of the World Peace Council, Mr. Joliot-Curie, requested me on June 16th, in my capacity as President of the UN Security Council, to meet with a delegation from the World Peace Council. I replied to Mr. Joliot-Curie that I agreed to meet with the delegation from the World Peace Council in New York from June 25th to 27th, and sent telegrams to the various representatives of the delegation. I have now received a telegram from the British Peace Committee stating that although the British representatives, Mrs. Davies and Mrs. Strutt, have repeatedly applied to the American Embassy in London, they have not yet received American visas. The current situation is that the meeting between the delegation of the World Peace Council and the President of the UN Security Council may be hindered because the representatives of the delegation of the World Peace Council have not obtained American visas, unless immediate measures are taken to issue visas to the representatives of the World Peace Council who have formally applied for visas to American embassies and consulates in various locations.

　　Because the representatives of the World Peace Council have been delayed in obtaining visas, I sent an urgent telegram on June 23rd to Mr. Austin, head of the US delegation to the United Nations, requesting him to take all possible measures to expedite the issuance of visas. However, to date, I have not received a reply from Mr. Austin to this telegram, and judging from the telegram sent by the British Peace Committee on June 26th, the situation remains unchanged, and Mrs. Davies and Mrs. Strutt have still not received visas. I request you, Mr. Secretary of State, to take measures to ensure that these representatives of the World Peace Council immediately obtain entry visas to come to New York. They are coming to New York as representatives of the delegation of the World Peace Council to meet with the President of the UN Security Council. Needless to say, the resolution of this issue should not be delayed.

　　I request you, Mr. Secretary of State, to inform me of the measures you have taken.

　　At the same time, Malik also sent a letter to the UN Secretariat, requesting that his telegram to Acheson be published as a document of the Security Council.

Xinhua News Agency, June 29th dispatch: TASS, Prague—The World Peace Council Information Bureau issued a communique on June 27th stating that the President of the World Peace Council, Professor Joliot-Curie, had notified the Soviet representative to the United Nations and President of the Security Council, Malik, that the United States had not issued a single visa to the representatives of the World Peace Council who were preparing to go to the United Nations.

　　Joliot-Curie requested Security Council President Malik to meet with the two American members of the World Peace Council delegation in the United States, Robertson and Uphaus. At the same time, Joliot-Curie requested Robertson and Uphaus to visit Security Council President Malik to complete the mission of the delegation.

　　The communique also stated that, according to the resolution passed by the World Peace Council Berlin Conference on February 25, 1951, the World Peace Council delegation must request the United Nations to:

　　1. Consider the points raised in the World Peace Congress's letter to the United Nations, as well as the various resolutions passed by the World Peace Council, and express its views on each item;

　　2. Resume the execution of the tasks stipulated in the United Nations Charter, that is, the United Nations should serve as a venue for reaching agreements between governments, and not as a tool of any dominant group.

　　和平理事会代表赴联合国被阻
    马立克促艾奇逊发入境签证
    约里奥—居里请罗伯逊等访马立克
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：苏联驻联合国代表、安全理事会六月份主席马立克，于六月二十七日向美国国务卿艾奇逊发出以下的电报。华盛顿美国国务卿艾奇逊先生：
    世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里先生于六月十六日请求我以联合国安全理事会主席的身份接见世界和平理事会的代表团。我已答复约里奥—居里先生，同意于六月二十五日至二十七日在纽约接见和平理事会的代表团、并且分别致电代表团的各代表。现在我接得英国和平委员会的电报，其中说英国代表戴维斯夫人与斯崔特夫人虽然一再向伦敦美国大使馆提出申请，然而至今没有获得美国的签证。目前的情况是，由于世界和平理事会代表团的代表没有获得美国的签证，世界和平理事会代表团会见联合国安全理事会主席一事可能受到阻碍，除非立刻采取措施把签证发给向各地美国大使馆和领事馆正式申请签证的世界和平理事会的代表。
    由于世界和平理事会代表迟迟未能获得签证，我已于六月二十三日以急电致美国驻联合国代表团团长奥斯汀先生，要求他采取一切可能的措施以加速发给签证。然而迄今为止，我没有收到奥斯汀先生对这个电报的答复，而根据英国和平委员会于六月二十六日发出的电报来判断，情况依然未变，戴维斯夫人与斯崔特夫人两位代表仍没有获得签证。我请求你，国务卿先生，采取措施，使世界和平理事会的这些代表立刻获得来纽约的入境签证。他们是要以世界和平理事会代表团代表的身份来纽约会见联合国安全理事会主席的。不用说，这个问题的解决不应有所拖延。
    我请求你，国务卿先生，把你所采取的措施通知我。
    同时，马立克也致函联合国秘书处，要求把他致艾奇逊的电报作为安全理事会的文件公布。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：世界和平理事会新闻处于六月二十七日发表公报说，世界和平理事会主席约里奥——居里教授已通知苏联驻联合国代表、安全理事会主席马立克说，美国对世界和平理事会准备派往联合国的代表，连一个签证也没有发给。
    约里奥—居里要求安理会主席马立克接见世界和平理事会代表团中在美国的两位美籍团员罗伯逊和乌法斯。同时，约里奥——居里要求罗伯逊和乌法斯访问安理会主席马立克，完成该代表团的使命。
    公报又说，根据一九五一年二月二十五日世界和平理事会柏林会议通过的决议，世界和平理事会代表团必须要求联合国：
    一、考虑世界和平大会致联合国书中所提各点，以及世界和平理事会所通过的各种决议，并逐项表示意见；
    二、恢复执行联合国宪章所规定的任务，就是说，联合国应当作为各国政府之间取得协议的场所，而不应作为任何居统治地位的集团的工具。
