Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 5th. The Chinese Communist Party Shanxi Provincial Committee convened a meeting on the 4th to discuss the CCP Central Committee's instructions requiring Party committees at all levels to ensure the victorious completion of the cotton purchasing and storing task. In order to specifically implement these instructions, the meeting decided: 1. Party organizations at all levels should immediately convene meetings to discuss the Central Committee's instructions, conduct political mobilization, and, in accordance with prescribed methods and the cotton purchasing and storing task, rapidly formulate their own specific plans, organize forces, conduct checks at each level, and vigorously implement them. In order to victoriously complete this extremely important and arduous political task given by the Central Committee, every party member in the province must truly play a leading role, using their own patriotic exemplary actions to influence and persuade the broad masses of cotton farmers to sell and store cotton for the state. Party member cadres working in economic departments related to cotton purchasing should redouble their efforts, become familiar with policies and operations, and strengthen organizational management to ensure the completion of the cotton purchasing and storing task. 2. Propagandists and speakers should use various methods to conduct propaganda and mobilization, clearly explaining the inter-dependent and mutually developing relationship between industry and agriculture, especially the textile industry and cotton farmers, and that actively selling all stored cotton to the state or storing it in state-entrusted economic agencies is a concrete action to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country. At the same time, they must also clearly explain the policies, stating that all cotton purchasing and storing methods are completely beneficial to cotton farmers: the government has stipulated reasonable listed prices for purchasing cotton farmers' cotton, and organizations and individuals who achieve significant results in carrying out patriotic cotton selling and storing competitions will be given honorary or material rewards, and state-owned trading departments and cooperatives will give priority to supplying cotton farmers with the necessary means of livelihood and means of production. Such propaganda must be carried out in order to complete the task quickly on the basis of cotton farmers' conscious willingness. 3. Party member responsible cadres working in local financial and economic departments and cooperatives must guarantee with Party spirit that all stored cotton is sold to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company at local listed prices, and carry forward our Party's glorious tradition of being loyal to the country and the people. 4. Send cadres to the three cotton-producing areas of Yuncheng, Linfen, and Yuci to convey this arrangement of the Provincial Committee to the local Party committees and quickly promote the development of cotton purchasing and storing work there.

This newspaper, Shijiazhuang, 2400 hours on the 4th. The Shijiazhuang Commissioner's Office and various specialized companies in Shijiazhuang City have issued urgent instructions, requesting governments and local branches of specialized companies in various counties and districts to actively deploy, closely coordinate, and rapidly carry out cotton purchasing and storing work, and strive to complete this task by the end of June. The instructions decided to implement joint purchases in large and small markets in various places, centralize cotton transactions, and strictly prohibit illegal activities such as hoarding, refusing to sell, and raising prices. According to investigations, the amount of stored cotton in the counties of Shijiazhuang Prefecture and the production, cooperatives, private merchants, and cotton ginning factories in Shijiazhuang City is still quite large. As of the 4th, the agencies and cooperatives in the prefecture and Shijiazhuang City have already handed over 360,000 jin of lint cotton. In this directive from the Commissioner's Office, it is clearly stipulated that all stored cotton in cooperatives, urban production units, and finance must be handed over to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company within five days after receiving the instructions, otherwise it will be punished as a violation of economic discipline. Reasonable cotton prices have been set for cotton farmers and private merchants who store cotton, and they are welcome to actively sell cotton to the state. The Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government will hold a forum for cotton farmers in the suburbs in the next two days to publicize the significance of selling and storing cotton for the state from a political perspective.
