　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: Tokyo dispatch: According to the Japanese "Jiji Shinpo" newspaper, Yoshida government officials are holding secret meetings on the issue of rearming Japan, planning to begin open activities immediately after concluding a separate peace treaty with the United States. They are planning to establish a "Security" Ministry to centrally manage the Police Reserve Force, National Police, Local Police, and Maritime Safety Agency. This ministry will later be reorganized into a Ministry of Defense.
    The Kuomintang bandit Central News Agency’s Tokyo 26th dispatch revealed even more details about this conspiracy reported by the "Jiji Shinpo." The dispatch stated: The Yoshida's Liberal Party's General Affairs Committee has made five decisions "in preparation for when Japan can openly announce military build-up to the world." The decision stipulates the establishment of a "National Security Committee" within the Diet, and the appointment of a "National Security Minister" concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee, to centrally manage and command the disguised armed forces such as the Police Reserve Force, National Police, Local Police, and Maritime Safety Agency personnel. The decision plans that after the separate peace treaty, the "National Security Minister" will be renamed "Minister of Defense or any other appropriate name." The decision also plans to establish a "National Security Research Bureau" to engage in "intelligence gathering." The Police Reserve Force is the core of the planned Japanese armed forces, and this force will be renamed the so-called "Domestic Peace Preservation Force."
    Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese reactionary Yoshida government continues to confiscate progressive newspapers and journals and arrest Japanese patriots in large numbers. On the 24th, the Special Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice illegally ordered four progressive newspapers to be permanently shut down. The persecuted newspapers are: the trade union newspaper "Laborer," "New Youth News" published by the Democratic Youth League, "Peace Women's News," the organ of the Japan Democratic Women's Council, and "For the Motherland and Learning" published by the Youth Fatherland Front. At the same time, the Yoshida government dispatched a large number of police to search printing plants, distribution centers, and delivery stations that were identified as belonging to these newspapers, and conducted large-scale arrests of patriots. As of the 25th, police had searched more than 1,400 locations across the country, confiscated a large number of books and newspapers, and arrested more than 330 members of the Japanese Communist Party and other patriotic people.

　　吉田集团密谋加紧重新武装
    一俟单独媾和后即公开进行活动
    日政府大肆迫害进步人士与报刊
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：据日本《时事新报》报道，吉田政府人士正就重新武装日本问题举行秘密会议，打算等到与美国缔结单独和约后立即公开进行活动。他们正计划设立一个“保安”省，统一管辖警察后备队、国家警察、地方警察与海上保安厅。这个省将来将被改组为国防省。
    国民党匪帮中央社东京二十六日电更详细地透露了《时事新报》所报道的这一密谋。该电称：吉田的自由党的总务委员会已作出五点决定，“准备当日本能够向世界公开宣布整军时之用”。该决定规定在国会内成立“国家保安委员会”，并任命一个兼任该委员会主席的“国家保安大臣”，统一管辖与指挥警察后备队、国家警察、地方警察、海上保安厅人员等变相的武装部队。该决定计划在单独媾和后，“国家保安大臣”即更名为“国防大臣或任何其他适当名称”。该决定并计划设立“国家保安研究局”，从事“搜集情报”的工作。警察后备队是计划中的日本武装部队的核心，该队将被改名为所谓“国内和平保卫军”。
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：日本吉田反动政府继续查封进步报刊，并大批逮捕日本爱国者。二十四日，法务府特别审查局非法勒令四家进步报刊永久停刊，这些被迫害的报刊是：工会报纸《劳动者》、民主青年团出版的《新青年新闻》、日本民主妇女协议会机关报《和平妇女新闻》以及青年祖国阵线出版的《为了祖国和学问》。同时，吉田政府并出动了大批警察，搜查被指为这些报刊的印刷厂、发行所和投递站，并对爱国者进行大规模逮捕。截至二十五日为止，警察在全国各地搜查了一千四百个以上的场所，没收了大批书报，并逮捕了三百三十名以上的日本共产党员与其他爱国人士。
