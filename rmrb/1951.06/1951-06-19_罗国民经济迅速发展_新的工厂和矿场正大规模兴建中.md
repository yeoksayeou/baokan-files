Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. According to TASS, Pravda published on the 16th an article by Luca, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Vice-Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers, discussing the development of the Romanian national economy. Luca said: The Romanian government and the Romanian Workers' Party, learning from the Soviet experience and based on Stalin's doctrine of socialist construction, have implemented a planned economy for the development of the national economy. The main link in the national plan is socialist industrialization, the establishment and development of heavy industry and machine manufacturing. In the first two years of implementing the planned economy (1949 to 1950), Romania's industrial production doubled compared to 1948 and greatly exceeded Romania's pre-war peak level—the level of 1938. Romania has begun to produce various types of special steel, modern machine tools, hydroelectric generators, transformers and other machinery, and has mastered the technology for mass production of oil refining equipment, heavy machinery, and agricultural machinery. The scale of various construction projects is also increasing. New factories are being established, new mines are being opened, and new roads and railways are being built. Farmers are now able to use tractors and various agricultural machinery. Romania has established one hundred and thirty-eight agricultural machinery stations, with a total of six thousand one hundred tractors.

Luca continued: Romania has begun implementing a long-term national economic plan this year. The basic task of the first five-year plan and the ten-year electrification plan is to build the foundation of socialism and gradually eliminate capitalist elements in various sectors of the national economy. The five-year plan stipulates that the total industrial output in 1955 should increase by 144% compared to 1950, and stipulates that large-scale steel plants, dozens of machinery plants, and power plants should be built. The five-year plan stipulates that the natural resources of various economically backward areas should be rationally utilized and new industrial enterprises should be established to develop these areas.

　　罗国民经济迅速发展        
    新的工厂和矿场正大规模兴建中
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报十六日刊载罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记、罗马尼亚部长会议副主席卢加的论述罗马尼亚国民经济发展的文章。卢加说：罗马尼亚政府和罗马尼亚工人党学习苏联的经验并根据斯大林的关于建设社会主义的学说，实施了发展国民经济的计划经济。国家计划的主要环节是社会主义工业化，建立并发展重工业和机器制造业。在实施计划经济的头两年中（一九四九年到一九五○年），罗马尼亚的工业生产比一九四八年增加了一倍，并且大大地超过了罗马尼亚战前的最高水平——一九三八年的水平。罗马尼亚已开始生产各种特种钢、现代化工作母机、水力发电机和变压器等机器，并已掌握了大量生产炼油装备、重型机器和农业机器的技术。各种建筑工程的规模也越来越大。新的工厂正在建立起来，新的矿场正在开工，新的公路和铁路在建筑中。农民已经能够使用拖拉机和各种农业机械了。罗马尼亚已建立了一百三十八个农业机器站，共拥有六千一百辆拖拉机。
    卢加接着说：罗马尼亚今年已开始执行长期的国民经济计划。第一个五年计划及十年电气化计划的基本任务是建设社会主义的基础，逐步消灭国民经济各部门中的资本主义成分。五年计划规定一九五五年工业总产量要比一九五○年增加百分之一百四十四，并且规定要建筑大规模的钢铁厂、几十个机器厂和电力厂。五年计划规定要合理地利用各个在经济上落后的地区的自然资源，建立新的工业企业，来开发这些地区。（附图片）
