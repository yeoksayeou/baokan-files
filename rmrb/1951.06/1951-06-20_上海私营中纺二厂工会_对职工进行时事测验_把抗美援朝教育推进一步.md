　　Shanghai Private Zhongfang No. 2 Factory Union Conducts Current Affairs Quiz for Employees
    To Further Promote the Resist America, Aid Korea Education
    The Shanghai Private Zhongfang No. 2 Factory checked its Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education work over four days from May 20th to 24th. Through this inspection, the masses' awareness has been further raised.

    Before this major inspection, the union first developed a plan, and in accordance with the plan, used various propaganda tools to publicize and explain to the masses and conduct ideological preparation. During the inspection, test questions were issued to party members, members of the Communist Youth League, union cadres, and senior students of the workers' spare-time school. The content included the basic principles of Resist America, Aid Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and opposition to the United States arming Japan. For workers with lower levels of education, a spot-check method was used.

    The inspection results showed that the masses had a deeper understanding of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. For example, when the test mentioned "Whose responsibility is the suppression of counter-revolutionaries?", everyone clearly answered "It is everyone's responsibility." When asked "Which counter-revolutionary elements have been arrested in the factory?", most workers could recite them one by one and said that they were the pawns of American imperialism. However, they did not understand the basic principles of Resist America, Aid Korea very well. Half of the workers believed that Resist America, Aid Korea was to oppose the United States arming Japan; a few people did not know that there were volunteers in Korea; and some female workers said that Resist America, Aid Korea was the labor insurance regulations. Regarding the issue of concluding a five-power peace pact, more than two-thirds of the people did not know what it was all about. After the staff gave the correct answers and explanations, everyone initially understood these issues.

    Through this inspection, everyone's enthusiasm for making progress was stimulated, and the political awareness of each worker was also improved. For example, Xu Lingdi from the winding shop said: "This is really good. Let us use our brains first. If we can't answer, you will explain it to us. It's easier to remember this way, better than holding a meeting." Another female worker said, "When you speak at a big meeting, you say a lot, in one ear and out the other; at small meetings, everyone doesn't speak; asking us questions like this, using our brains, and then explaining, we will never forget." Some workers who usually don't care about politics have also become interested. For example, Qu Xuesen and eighteen other workers immediately signed up for night school, and the people watching the blackboard newspaper became more crowded. Female workers who didn't care about politics in the past are now copying the blackboard newspaper with pencils. The mud workers, who had not established a patriotic pact, also automatically established a patriotic pact through this inspection. Many workers also requested that a quiz be held every two weeks as a regular system.

    In response to the above situation, the union decided to strengthen propaganda and education for female workers; give a ten-minute current affairs explanation before class at the workers' school; conduct a quiz every two or three weeks based on the central task; give at least one current political report to cadres every month; in addition, it will also rectify the reading group, strengthen broadcasting and blackboard newspapers, and it is expected that within three months, every worker will be able to understand the basic principles of Resist America, Aid Korea.

    Editor's note: The Shanghai Private Zhongfang No. 2 Factory Union's method of generally checking Resist America, Aid Korea education is good. This can not only understand the extent to which Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda and education have been popularized and deepened among the employees, and find out the direction for improvement; it is also a very good education for the employees. We suggest that trade unions in various regions conduct such inspections at certain periods to further promote propaganda and education work.

### 上海私营中纺二厂工会  对职工进行时事测验  把抗美援朝教育推进一步

　　上海私营中纺二厂工会  对职工进行时事测验        
    把抗美援朝教育推进一步
    上海私营中纺二厂在五月二十至二十四日四天中，检查了抗美援朝宣传教育工作。通过这次检查，群众觉悟又提高了一步。
    这次的大检查之前，工会先订出了计划，依照计划用各种宣传工具向群众宣传解释，进行思想酝酿。检查时，对党员、团员、工会干部及工人业余学校的高年级学员，发给试题测验，内容包括抗美援朝基本道理、镇压反革命、反对美国武装日本等；对文化程度较低的工人，采用抽问方式。
    检查结果，发现群众对镇压反革命的认识较深刻，如测验中提到“镇压反革命是谁的事情”，大家都明确地回答“是大家的事情”。当问到“厂里逮捕了那些反革命分子”时，大部分工人都能一一背诵出来，并且说出了它们是美帝国主义的爪牙。但对抗美援朝的基本道理懂得不多，有半数工人认为抗美援朝就是反对美国武装日本；有少数人还不晓得有志愿军到朝鲜；也有些女工说抗美援朝就是劳动保险条例。对于缔结五大国和平公约问题，有三分之二以上的人不晓得是怎么一回事。经过工作人员作了正确的答案及解释后，大家才把这些问题初步弄明白了。
    通过这次检查，激发了大家要求进步的积极性，也提高了每个工友的政治认识。如纡子间的许令弟说：“这样真好，先让我们动一下脑筋，我们答不出，你们再解释，这样容易记牢，比开会还要好。”另一女工说：“开大会，你们讲一大套，左耳进，右耳出；开小会，大家又不说话；这样问问我们，动动脑筋，再解释解释，永远也不会忘记。”有些平时不关心政治的工友，也发生了兴趣，如瞿学森等十八个工友，立刻报名上夜校，看黑板报的人更拥挤了。过去不关心政治的女工，现在都用铅笔抄黑板报。一直未订立爱国公约的泥水工，通过这次检查，也自动订出了爱国公约。许多工人并要求以后每两星期举行一次测验，成为经常的制度。
    针对上述情况，工会决定加强对女工的宣传教育；在工人学校上课前，作十分钟时事讲解；根据中心任务，每两周或三周举行一次测验；在干部中每月至少作一次时事政治报告；此外并整顿读报组，加强广播及黑板报，预计要在三个月中使每个工人都能懂得抗美援朝的基本道理。
    编者按：上海私营中纺二厂工会普遍检查抗美援朝教育的办法是好的。这样不仅可以了解抗美援朝宣传教育在职工群众中普及与深入的程度，找出改进的方向；同时对职工也是一次很好的教育。我们建议各地工会都能在一定的时期进行一次这样的检查，把宣传教育工作推进一步。
