    (7) In August 1945, the Eighth Route Army liberated the county town, and Wang Quanfu's village also joined the ranks. The people were liberated, and the farmers happily shouted, "Now we can turn over a new leaf!"
　　(8) The Communist Party and the People's Government led the land reform, and Wang Quanfu's family was allocated twenty-one mu of good land.
　　(9) At this time, Wang Quanfu's son, Wang Shun, retired from the army due to injuries and worked as a security committee member in the village. He also made efforts to produce more in his spare time. The father and son cultivated carefully, and the grain they harvested was more than they could eat.
