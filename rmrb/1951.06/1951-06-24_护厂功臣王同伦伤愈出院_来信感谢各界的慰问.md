　　Factory Protection Hero Wang Tonglun Discharged from Hospital
    Letter of Thanks for Condolences from All Sectors
     Comrade Wang Tonglun, Editor:
    Since I was wounded fighting the special agents, the care and love given to me by the people from all over the country has been immense. Some worker brothers sent representatives to visit me from very, very far away. Everyone gave me medals, commemorative badges, banners, and a large number of condolence gifts. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government also gave me the glorious title of "Factory Protection Hero." I have now received more than seven hundred and sixty condolence letters, some of which were sent from five or six thousand miles away. The encouragement given to me by the government and the people makes me feel no pain from the injury at all; what I feel is supreme glory, joy, and excitement. After I arrived at the hospital, thanks to the enthusiastic treatment and care of the doctors and nurses, I have now fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital on June 2nd. In order to improve our production and ensure the economic construction of the motherland, I must raise my vigilance, do a good job in production and defense work, and further assist the People's Government in suppressing counter-revolutionary work. We have now launched a campaign to donate airplanes and cannons, and I myself have donated five million yuan. I will use improving production, resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely supporting the Volunteer Army to repay the concern and love of people from all walks of life.
            Worker Wang Tonglun, from a certain machine factory in Shenyang

　　护厂功臣王同伦伤愈出院
    来信感谢各界的慰问
     王同伦编辑同志：
    自从我和特务搏斗负伤以后，各地人民给我的关心和热爱太多了。有些工人兄弟们从很远很远的地方，派代表来慰问我。大家送给我奖章、纪念章、锦旗和大批的慰问品，沈阳市人民政府并给我以“护厂功臣”的光荣称号。现在我已经收到七百六十多封慰问信，这些信有从五、六千里以外寄来的。政府和人民给我的鼓励，使我一点也不感到受伤的痛苦，我所感到的是无上的光荣、愉快和兴奋。我到医院以后，经过医师和护士同志的热心治疗看护，现已完全恢复健康，并于六月二日出院。为了搞好我们的生产，保证祖国的经济建设，我一定要提高警惕，作好生产、防卫工作，进一步协助人民政府进行镇压反革命工作。现在我们已经展开捐献飞机大炮运动，我自己也捐献五百万元。我要用搞好生产，坚决镇压反革命，坚决支援志愿军的行动，来答谢各界人民对我的关怀和热爱。
            沈阳某机器厂工人  王同伦
    编者按：王同伦同志是沈阳某机器厂的护厂功臣。本年五月九日深夜，他在工厂变电室和两个企图用汽油烧毁大电滚的特务进行英勇的搏斗，保护了工厂。
