　　Art Workers in Various Places Launch Donation Benefit Performance Campaign
    Literary and art workers across the country enthusiastically responded to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and the proposal of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to mobilize national art workers to donate a "Lu Xun" airplane. They are actively donating manuscript fees, royalties, drawing up creative plans, and holding benefit performances and exhibitions. Veteran Peking Opera artists and teachers and students of the Chinese Opera Research Institute's Opera Experimental School held their first joint benefit performance at the Popular Theater on the evening of the 17th of this month. Participants included: Shang Heyu, a 79-year-old famous martial artist; Ma Decheng and Zhang Dejun, 72-year-old famous martial artists; Hao Shouchang, a 66-year-old famous painted-face actor; Tan Xiaopei, a 70-year-old old man actor; Liu Xikui, a 58-year-old Qingyi actress, and others, who performed "Jinyang Palace," "Wu Song Fights the Store," "Burning the Bailiang Building," the entire "Famen Temple," and "Dang Jian Mai Ma," respectively. These Peking Opera veterans had been away from the stage for decades, some for as long as twenty years, but their high level of enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea inspired them to shave off their beards of over a decade and return to the stage. This patriotic action deeply moved the audience. The Beijing People's Art Theater and the Youth Art Theater also held a benefit performance of music and dance, featuring more than twenty programs including solos and dances. Many opera genres in Shanghai also held benefit performances. The Peking Opera Experimental Troupe of the East China Opera Research Institute performed night shows for three days starting on the 19th, with Zhou Xinfang starring in "Four Jinshi," and Cao Huilin also participated in the performance; the Gengsheng Comic Drama Troupe performed the anti-spy, anti-hegemony drama "Little Sanmao and the Tigress" at an early show on June 17; comic drama workers from the North and South held a joint grand performance at the East China Popular Theater on the 14th of this month, with Yang Huasheng and Zhang Qiaonong participating in the performance; the Tianchan Stage performed "Mo Dai" and donated the entire income of more than 30 million yuan from one week of night shows; the Liang Yiming Troupe of the China Grand Theater performed "Heroes' Gathering" and "Flower Tiaras"; the Pingtan Improvement Association held a new Pingtan conference show on the 17th of this month, performing "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and "Wu Song," etc.; the Huai Opera Improvement Association decided to mobilize fifteen Huai Opera troupes to hold benefit performances for two sessions, day and night, and some even performed three sessions in a row. In order to increase production, they added early morning performances every day, making the donation campaign a regular event. Directors and writers guaranteed that no old plays would be performed during the benefit performances, and each Huai Opera troupe rehearsed new operas with patriotic content. Shanghai dance artists are also preparing to hold regular benefit performances.
    The Nanjing and Guangzhou Literary and Art Circles Federations will hold benefit performances of drama, music, and dance, as well as fine art exhibitions. The Guangzhou Literary and Art Circles Federation also held a meeting on the 14th of this month with more than 200 people, who enthusiastically pledged donations of 250 million yuan. Faculty and staff of the Central South Military Region Art Academy also began performing the dance drama "Mother is Calling," the drama "Mother's Heart," and the opera "Singing of the Female Combat Hero Guo Junqing" at the academy's experimental theater starting on the 16th of this month. Qiqihar and western Liaoning and other places have also held benefit performances to donate to the "Lu Xun" airplane.
