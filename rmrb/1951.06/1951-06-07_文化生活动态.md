		To Ensure Readers in Every Corner of the Country Can Access Books and Periodicals on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    In response to the call of the China Peace Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and to meet the needs of popularizing and deepening the movement to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters has formulated a plan to distribute 100 million copies of books and periodicals on Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in 1951. This includes 50 million copies of periodicals, 40 million copies of popular readings, and 10 million copies of general readings. The bookstore has issued instructions to its branches across the country, calling on them to complete the distribution task of books and periodicals on Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The instructions require all branches to adopt diverse ways of promotion, and to organize public and private book distribution enterprises and all social distribution forces, as well as to vigorously promote sales through organizations such as trade unions, Communist Youth League, cooperatives, railways, post offices, and schools. The promotion work should be thorough and widespread, so that readers in every corner of the country can read books and periodicals on Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
		Popular Reader "Serial Pictorial" Published
    The semi-monthly popular reader "Serial Pictorial," compiled and printed by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, was published on the 1st. The publication uses serial pictures to help readers with lower levels of education learn about current events and various policies. The explanatory text of the pictures is simple and easy to understand, making it very suitable for reading by workers, peasants, and urban residents with an education level below senior primary school, as well as those who are just beginning to learn to read. The first issue of the publication contains the story of Chen Desheng, a lone hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers who destroyed an American tank, as well as story pictures such as "Ma Hengchang Team Challenges the Whole Country," "Launch the Spring Plowing and Production Increase Movement," "Tricycle Workers Catch Spies," and "Avenge Children Who Died Tragically Under the Bloody Hands of Imperialism."
		Zhengzhou City's "Little Teacher Teaching Groups" Educate More Than 8,000 Out-of-School Children in One and a Half Years
    Elementary school students in Zhengzhou City have formed little teacher teaching groups to educate out-of-school children, and have achieved great results in the past year and a half. According to statistics, there are currently 2,230 little teachers in the city, and more than 8,100 out-of-school children have been educated by them. Under the guidance of teachers in various schools, these little teachers form teaching groups of three to five people. They organize out-of-school children according to streets, and gather in the streets under electric lights, under eaves, or in open courtyards every evening to study for one to two hours. The courses of study generally include Chinese, arithmetic, singing, and games. This type of organization is called a literacy class. Some literacy classes have found classrooms with the help of residents, and have established systems for learning, asking for leave, and holding class meetings. There are also achievement columns and commendation and criticism columns in the classrooms. Many little teachers have learned to use cards, slides, and objects as teaching aids. These teaching tools are also made by themselves.

    为响应中国人民抗美援朝总会的号召，适应普及和深入抗美援朝运动的需要，新华书店总店已订出了一九五一年发行抗美援朝书刊一万万册的计划。一万万册中包括期刊五千万册，通俗读物四千万册，一般读物一千万册。该店已向全国分支店发出指示，号召各分支店完成抗美援朝书刊的发行任务。指示要求各分支店应采取多种多样的方式推销，并组织公私图书发行企业和一切社会发行力量，以及通过工会、青年团、合作社、铁路、邮局、学校等组织，大力推销。推销工作要做到深入和普及，使全国每个角落的读者都能阅读到抗美援朝的书刊。
            通俗读物《连环画报》出版
    人民美术出版社编印的以图画为主的通俗读物《连环画报》半月刊已于一日出版。该刊用连环图画的形式，帮助文化程度较低的读者学习时事和各种政策。图画的解说文字浅近易懂，很适合高小以下程度和初学文化的工农群众与城市一般市民阅读。该刊第一期刊载了中国人民志愿军独胆英雄陈德生击毁美国坦克的故事和“马恒昌小组向全国挑战”、“展开春耕丰产运动”、“三轮车工人捉特务”、“为惨死在帝国主义血手下的儿童报仇”等故事图画。
            郑州市“小先生教学小组”一年半教育失学儿童八千多名
    郑州市各小学学生组成小先生教学小组，教育失学儿童，一年半以来，已有很大成绩。据统计，全市现有小先生二千二百三十名，受他们教育的失学儿童有八千一百余名。这些小先生在各校教师的辅导下，由三人到五人组成教学小组。他们按着街道把失学的孩子们组织起来，每天傍晚聚在街头电灯下、屋檐下或敞院里学习一小时到两小时。学习的课程，一般地有国语、算术、唱歌和游戏。这种组织叫做识字班。有些识字班由于居民的帮助已找到了教室，并建立了学习、请假、班会等制度。教室里还辟有成绩栏和表扬批评栏。许多小先生都学会了使用卡片、幻灯和实物等辅助教学。这些教学工具也都是他们自己制造的。
