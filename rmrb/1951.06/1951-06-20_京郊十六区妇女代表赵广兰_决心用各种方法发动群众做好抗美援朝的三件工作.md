    Determined to Use Various Methods to Mobilize the Masses to Do Three Things Well in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
To the Editor:
    Since the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, I, a twenty-year-old youth, have been elected as a women's representative to the People's Representative Conference of the Sixteenth District in the suburbs of Beijing. I am truly happy. After I return to my village, I will definitely use methods such as writing blackboard newspapers, broadcasting from rooftops, visiting door-to-door, and holding women's meetings to convey the three resolutions of this conference to the masses: establishing patriotic covenants, donating airplanes and cannons, and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. I will also mobilize women to establish family patriotic covenants and encourage them to fetch water and do chores for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to help them solve their difficulties. Starting from June, I myself will donate 10,000 yuan each month to donate airplanes and cannons, and I will donate all the money I earn from sideline production (sifting gravel) until the American devils in Korea are eliminated. In short, after I return to the village, I will not only actively promote the resolutions of this conference, but also become a model for implementing the resolutions.

    增加生产捐献飞机大炮  支援志愿军狠狠打美国强盗
　　京郊十六区妇女代表赵广兰        
    决心用各种方法发动群众做好抗美援朝的三件工作        编辑同志：
    共产党、毛主席来了，我这个二十岁的青年被大家选为北京市郊第十六区各界人民代表会议的妇女代表。我真高兴极啦。我回村后一定要用写黑板报、屋顶广播、串门、开妇女会等方法，向群众传达这次会议关于订立爱国公约、捐献飞机大炮、优待烈属军属的三个决议。我还要动员妇女订立家庭爱国公约，发动她们给烈属、军属挑水、做活，解决困难。我自己从六月份起，每月要拿出一万元捐献飞机大炮，并把我搞副业生产（筛石子）赚来的钱全部捐献出来，一直到把在朝鲜的美国鬼子消灭为止。总之，我回村不但要积极宣传这次会议的决议，并且自己要成为执行决议的模范。
