　　Tehran Demonstrators' Resolution
    Demands Cancellation of British and American Oil Privileges
    And Advocates Democratization of Domestic Political System
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] According to a TASS report from Tehran on the 31st, mass parades, demonstrations and mass meetings were held in many Iranian cities on May 29th. Due to martial law, no meetings were held in Khuzestan. The "National Iranian Anti-Imperialist Oil Company Struggle Association" organized anti-Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and anti-imperialist parades, demonstrations and meetings.
    A resolution was passed at a grand rally held in Tehran's square opposite the parliament. The resolution stated:
    "We demand that the usurping former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company be immediately removed from Iran, and that the company unconditionally transfer all matters related to the development, production, sales, and accounts of the oil business to the Iranian government. Delaying this matter is tantamount to succumbing to the American and British imperialists and betraying the interests of the people. The Iranian people demand that the huge material losses suffered by Iran over the past fifty years be accurately determined, so that, based on these losses, which amount to billions of Tomans (Iranian currency), all industrial enterprises and transportation tools of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company be confiscated. The Iranian people will never recognize any rights of the usurping former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and demand that the parts of the nationalization bill involving these rights be cancelled. The Iranian people believe that any obligations to the imperialist oil companies, especially the obligation to sell oil products to the imperialists, are harmful and wrong. The Iranian people express great indignation at the British government's intimidation and the American imperialists' shameless interference in Iran's internal affairs (which shows that the imperialists intend to unite and continue to plunder Iran's national wealth together). The Iranian people demand that, in order to respond to this policy of intimidation and interference, the Iranian lower house and the Iranian government should rely on the powerful anti-imperialist forces of the people and take measures to eradicate the imperialists' influence in Iran."
    The resolution also stated: "The Iranian people demand the restoration of Iran's political sovereignty over Bahrain Island and the immediate cancellation of the American oil company there, and the nationalization of the company's enterprises."
    One part of the resolution called for the democratization of the country's political system.

　　德黑兰示威人民决议
    要求取消英、美石油特权
    并主张国内政治制度民主化
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰三十一日讯：五月二十九日，伊朗许多城市都举行了群众游行示威与群众大会。库齐斯坦由于戒严关系，没有举行大会。“伊朗全国反帝国主义石油公司斗争协会”组织了反英伊石油公司与反帝国主义的游行示威和大会。
    在德黑兰国会对面广场上举行的盛大集会通过了一项决议。决议说：
    “我们要求立即从伊朗除掉篡夺性的前英伊石油公司，并由该公司把一切有关石油企业的开发、生产、销售及帐目等，无条件移交伊朗政府。推延此事，就等于屈从美、英帝国主义者与出卖人民的利益。伊朗人民要求精确地确定五十年以来伊朗蒙受的巨大物质损失，以便根据这个数以数十亿土曼（伊朗货币）计的损失，没收前英伊石油公司所有的一切工业企业与运输工具。伊朗人民决不承认篡夺性的前英伊石油公司有任何权利，并要求把国有化法案中涉及这些权利的部分取消。伊朗人民认为对帝国主义石油公司的任何义务，特别是以石油产品售给帝国主义者的义务，都是有害的和不对的。伊朗人民对英国政府的威吓与美国帝国主义者的无耻干涉伊朗内政（这表明帝国主义者们打算联合起来继续共同掠夺伊朗的国家财富），表示非常愤慨。伊朗人民要求：为了回答这种威吓与干涉的政策，伊朗下院与伊朗政府应依靠强大的人民反帝力量，采取办法，根绝帝国主义者在伊朗的影响。”
    决议又称：“伊朗人民要求恢复伊朗对巴林岛的政治主权，并立即取消该地的美国石油公司，把该公司的企业国有化。”
    决议有一部分是要求该国政治制度民主化。
