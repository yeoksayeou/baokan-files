The State Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Instructions on the 1951 Agricultural Tax Collection Work" on the 21st. This was formulated based on the state's tax policy, referring to the experience of the 1950 agricultural tax work and the different current rural economic conditions across the country. It is more reasonable and practical than last year's agricultural tax burden method. Agricultural tax is currently and will continue to be one of the state's most important sources of income for a considerable period, and the implementation of a reasonably burdened agricultural tax policy is not only an important guarantee for national fiscal revenue but also an important condition for encouraging farmers to actively produce. In this sense, the issuance of the aforementioned document is of great significance.

According to the "Instructions on the 1951 Agricultural Tax Collection Work" promulgated by the State Council, agricultural tax will have three different tax systems in three different regions in the future.

First, the proportional tax system. This method is implemented in the old liberated areas, which currently have a population of approximately 140 million. In these areas, the land of landlords and old-style rich peasants has already been distributed. Agricultural taxes have been successively changed to the proportional tax system. Although this tax system still has differences, such as the proportional tax system with exemption points in North China, Shandong, and northern Shaanxi, and the proportional tax system without exemption points like in the Northeast, they are all simple and reasonable, and have played a significant role in encouraging farmers' enthusiasm for production. At present, the basic economic situation in the rural areas of the old liberated areas is still suitable for implementing the proportional tax system. In the old liberated areas, agricultural production has rapidly recovered and developed, and the living standards of farmers are generally improving. Middle peasants account for the largest majority of the rural population (generally about 80% of the agricultural population); although there have been some changes in land relations, most of them are aimed at adjusting production (such as exchanging bad land for good land, exchanging distant land for nearby land, selling land to buy livestock and farm tools, etc.), and the phenomenon of land concentration is not significant. According to survey materials from 25 villages in 19 counties in five provinces in Northeast and North China, the number of new-style rich peasant households accounts for only 0.208% of the total number of households, which means they do not occupy an important position in the countryside. Therefore, it is completely correct to continue using the proportional tax system in the old areas.

Second, the progressive tax system. This is implemented in the newly liberated areas that have not yet implemented land reform. These areas currently have a population of approximately 100 million. In these areas, feudal land relations basically still exist. Landlords, rich peasants, middle peasants, and poor peasants have very different amounts of land and income, and therefore their ability to bear the burden varies greatly. Therefore, it is basically appropriate to continue implementing the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" promulgated by the Central People's Government in 1950 in these areas.

Third, the moderately progressive tax system. This tax system is implemented in the newly liberated areas that have implemented land reform. These areas currently have a population of approximately 160 million. In these areas, the landlord class has been eliminated, and land relations have undergone fundamental changes, so they should not adopt the same progressive tax rates as the newly liberated areas that have not undergone land reform, but the newly liberated areas that have undergone land reform still retain the old-style rich peasant economy and are not completely the same as the old liberated areas, so it is not appropriate to implement the proportional tax system. Therefore, the State Council has decided to implement a relatively moderate progressive tax. The highest progressive rate is limited to 30%.

For the burden of leased land in areas that have implemented land reform, it should generally not be handled according to the pre-land reform policy. Because after land reform, the relationship between leasing and renting is no longer a relationship between farmers and landlords, but a relationship within the farmers. Landlords are mainly laborers who lack labor power and engage in other occupations. Therefore, the income from leased land and the income from rented land need not be converted separately, and should generally be calculated and burdened according to their respective income. Only in this way can it be conducive to the unity and production of farmers.

Someone once asked: Why not formulate a unified agricultural tax, but instead implement three different tax systems and tax rates at the same time? This is mainly because there are actually three different situations in rural China at present, and three different burden methods are necessary. Only in this way can it conform to the specific situation of the current rural economy of the country. Of course, by next year, after all the newly liberated areas have completed land reform, the second type of area will no longer exist, and the second type of burden method will naturally not be necessary. As for whether the agricultural tax collection methods in the newly liberated areas that have implemented land reform and the old liberated areas will also be unified soon, that will depend on the development of the rural economy. In fact, our country is very vast, the situation is very complicated, and even within the same type of area, there are often great differences. The specific methods of agricultural tax vary from place to place, which is not only harmless to the unified policy, but can also more accurately reflect the unified policy of the state. Last year, the Central People's Government resolutely implemented a unified agricultural tax law in the newly liberated areas, implementing the policy of "surveying fields to determine production and calculating tax according to the rate," which achieved great results and overcame the serious biases of "collecting taxes according to class," "too narrow burden surface," and "layer-by-layer apportionment" in the grain collection work in 1949. However, the unified agricultural tax law has some shortcomings in taking care of the different economic characteristics of various places. Therefore, this year, it will further implement a certain range of adapting to local conditions under the unified policy. It can be predicted that after the implementation of this decision of the State Council, the agricultural tax collection work in 1951 will achieve greater results.

Some people are also worried that after the central government emphasizes taking care of the different situations in various places and adapting to local conditions, will it cause local governments to act freely in agricultural tax collection, not implement tax calculation according to the rate, and even repeat the chaotic situation of 1949? This will not happen. The experience of collecting agricultural tax in 1950 proves that governments at all levels can act in accordance with the policies stipulated by the central government and overfulfill the task. Moreover, Article 5 of the aforementioned instructions clearly stipulates that "People's governments at all levels must strictly calculate and collect taxes in accordance with the tax rates approved by the State Council of the Central People's Government, and shall not freely increase or decrease them." At the same time, the tax rates drafted by various places must be approved by the State Council before they can be implemented, which is the most effective guarantee.

Is it easy to complete the agricultural tax work in 1951? Can we be complacent because the agricultural tax work in 1950 has achieved great results, and the State Council has issued correct instructions in a timely manner this year?

The fact is that the task of agricultural tax this year is still very heavy, and we must work hard to complete the task. In rural areas, there are currently two aspects of the situation. On the one hand, the people of the whole country are carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the land reform movement is being carried out in the vast new areas. These movements have greatly improved the class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. They understand that the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and national construction needs the strong support of the people of the whole country. Therefore, actively paying agricultural tax has become and will become a practical action of patriotism for the broad masses of peasants. On the other hand, due to the needs of national defense and economic construction, the burden on farmers cannot be reduced. In the newly liberated areas, as a result of land reform, land has been transferred to the hands of farmers, and land income is entirely owned by farmers, so agricultural tax cannot but be entirely borne by farmers. Moreover, after the land is dispersed, the progressive rate is reduced, and in order for the government to maintain the same income as last year, the tax rate has to be appropriately adjusted and increased. Therefore, governments at all levels and financial departments and grain collection workers must carry out sincere and patient propaganda work to the newly liberated peasants, so that the peasant masses can fully understand the relationship between the collection of agricultural tax and the central political tasks of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and land reform, so as to encourage the enthusiasm of peasants to pay taxes, and fully guard against the conspiracy of counter-revolutionaries to sabotage grain collection. Explaining the political situation to the peasants is the key to ensuring the success of agricultural tax collection. Governments at all levels should pay close attention to the propaganda work on agricultural tax.

### 作好一九五一年农业税工作

　　作好一九五一年农业税工作
    中央人民政府政务院二十一日颁布了《关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示》。这是根据国家的税收政策，参照一九五○年农业税工作的经验和当前全国农村经济的不同情况制定的。它比去年的农业税负担办法更合理更实际。农业税在目前以及在今后相当长的时期内仍然是国家的最主要收入之一，而合理负担的农业税收政策的贯彻，不仅对于国家财政收入是一个重要保证，而且是鼓励农民积极生产的重要条件。在这一个意义上，上述文件的发布，是具有重要意义的。
    根据政务院颁布的《关于一九五一年农业税收工作的指示》，今后，农业税在三种不同地区有三种不同的税制。
    第一是比例税制。这个办法实行于现约有一亿四千万人口的老解放区。在这种地区内，地主和旧式富农的土地，早已经过分配。农业税已相继改行比例税制。这个税制虽然还有华北、山东、陕北等区的有免征点的比例税制，和东北那样无免征点的比例税制的差别，但都简易合理，对鼓励农民生产积极性，都起了很大作用。在目前，老解放区农村经济的基本情况，仍然适宜于实行比例税制。在老解放区中，农业生产迅速恢复和发展，农民生活正普遍提高，中农占农村人口的最大多数（一般约占农业人口的百分之八十左右）；土地关系虽有部分变动，但以调整生产（如坏地换好地，远地换近地，卖地买牲口农具等）为目的者居多，土地集中的现象尚不显著，据东北、华北五省十九个县二十五个村的调查材料，新式富农户数只占总户数百分之○·二○八，即在农村中还不占重要地位。因此，在老区仍沿用比例税制，是完全正确的。
    第二是累进税制。这是实行于尚未实行土地改革的新解放地区。这些地区内，目前约有一亿人口。这种地区基本上还存在着封建的土地关系。地主、富农、中农、贫农占有的土地和收入相差很大，因而各阶层负担能力相去甚远。因此，在这种地区，继续实行一九五○年中央人民政府颁布的《新解放区农业税暂行条例》，是基本上适宜的。
    第三是缓进的累进税制。这种税制实行于已实行土地改革的新解放地区。这种地区，现在约有一亿六千万人口。这种地区内，地主阶级已经消灭，土地关系已起了根本变化，所以不应和未经过土地改革的新解放区采取同样的累进税率，但已经土地改革的新解放区还保留了旧式富农经济，又不完全相同于老解放区，所以也不宜实行比例税制。因此，政务院决定实行较缓的累进税。累进最高率以百分之三十为限。
    对于已实行土地改革地区内的租佃地的负担，一般不应照未土地改革前的方针办理。因为土地改革后，租佃关系，已不是农民对地主的关系，而是农民内部的关系。出租户主要是缺乏劳力和从事其他职业的劳动人民，因此，出租地的收入和租佃地的收入不必再分别折算，一般只应按各自收入计算负担。这样才能有利于农民的团结和生产。
    有人曾经这样问：为什么不制定统一的农业税，而要同时实行着三种不同的税制税率呢？这主要是目前中国农村，事实上存在着三种不同的情况，不能不需要三种不同的负担办法。只有这样，才能与国家当前农村经济具体情况相符合。当然，到明年，新解放区全部完成土地改革之后，第二种地区没有了，第二种负担办法也自然不必要了。至于已实行土地改革的新区和老解放区的农业税收办法是否也要很快统一呢？那就要看农村经济的发展情况来决定。事实上，我们的国家是十分辽阔，情况是十分复杂，即使在同一类型的地区之内往往也有很大的不同，农业税的具体办法因地而异，不但无害于统一的政策，而且可以更确切地体现了国家统一的政策。去年中央人民政府在新解放区坚决实行了统一的农业税法，实行“查田定产，依率计征”的方针，曾经收到很大的成绩，克服了一九四九年征粮工作中“按阶级征收”，“负担面过窄”，“层层加派”这些严重的偏向。但统一的农业税法，对于各地方不同经济特点的照顾上，是有不足之处的。所以今年就进一步在统一政策下实行一定范围的因地制宜。可以预料，实行政务院这个决定之后，一九五一年的农业税收工作将会有更大的成绩。
    也有人顾虑，在中央强调照顾各地不同情况而因地制宜之后，是不是会造成地方政府在农业税收上的自由行动，不实行依率计征，甚至会重复一九四九年的混乱现象呢？这是不会的。一九五○年征收农业税的经验证明，各级人民政府，都能按照中央所规定的政策办事的，并超额完成任务。而且上述指示第五条已明白规定“各级人民政府必须严格依照中央人民政府政务院核准的税率计征，不得自由增加或减少”。同时，各地所拟订的税率，都要经政务院批准才能执行，这是最有效的保证。
    一九五一年的农业税工作是否很容易完成任务呢？是不是可以因为一九五○年农业税工作已取得很大成绩，今年政务院又适时地颁布了正确的指示，而可以自满呢？
    事实是，今年农业税的任务还很重，必须艰苦地工作，才能完成任务。在农村中，目前存在着两方面的情况。一方面全国人民正在进行着抗美援朝，镇压反革命的运动，在广大新区正在进行土地改革运动。这些运动大大地提高了广大农民的阶级觉悟和爱国主义热情，他们懂得抗美援朝和国家建设事业都需要全国人民用大力予以支持，因此，踊跃交纳农业税已经而且将要成为广大农民爱国的实际行动。另一方面，由于国防和经济建设的需要，农民的负担还不能减轻。在新解放区，由于土地改革的结果，土地既已转移到农民的手里，土地收入完全为农民所得，农业税也就不能不全部由农民来负担。而且土地分散之后，累进降缓，政府为了保持与去年同样的收入，税率便不能不有适当的调整和提高。因此各级人民政府及财政部门公粮征收工作人员，必须对新翻身的农民进行恳切耐心的宣传工作，使农民群众充分认识征收农业税与抗美援朝、土地改革这样中心的政治任务的关系，以鼓舞农民纳税的热情，并充分警惕反革命分子破坏征粮的阴谋。向农民说明政治形势，是保证农业税征收成功的关键，各级人民政府应当十分注意关于农业税的宣传工作。
