　　Cotton and Cloth Company in Cotton-Producing Areas
Raises Purchase Price of Cotton

To ensure the successful completion of the state's cotton purchase and storage tasks, the state-owned Cotton and Cloth Company, in accordance with instructions from the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, has generally adjusted cotton purchase prices in cotton-producing areas. As of June 1st, the branch companies of the state-owned Cotton and Cloth Company in the main cotton distribution centers of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Linqing in Hebei Province; Xinxiang and Anyang in Pingyuan Province; Dezhou and Jinan in Shandong Province; Zhengzhou in Henan Province; Xi'an in Shaanxi Province; and various parts of Northern Jiangsu, have generally raised cotton purchase prices by approximately 5 percent. Since the adjustment, the purchase price of ginned cotton by the state-owned Cotton and Cloth Company in the aforementioned regions has increased from approximately 8,300 yuan per catty to approximately 8,800 yuan. It is now much more profitable for farmers in cotton-producing areas to sell and store cotton with the state locally.

　　产棉区花纱布公司
    调升购棉牌价
    【新华社八日讯】国营花纱布公司在产棉区普遍调整了棉花收购牌价。为了保证国家购棉、存棉任务胜利完成，国营花纱布公司所属在产棉区的分、支公司根据中央人民政府贸易部的指示，已经于六月一日在河北省的保定、石家庄、邯郸、临清，平原省的新乡、安阳，山东省的德州、济南，河南省的郑州，陕西省的西安及苏北各地各个主要棉花集散地，普遍调升棉花收购牌价百分之五左右。调整以来，上述各地国营花纱布公司的皮棉收购牌价，已从每斤八千三百元提高到八千八百元左右。产棉区农民就地向国家售棉、存棉已比过去有利得多。
