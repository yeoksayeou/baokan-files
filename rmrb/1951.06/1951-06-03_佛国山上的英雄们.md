The Heroes on Buddha Country Mountain
    Yu Qian, Lin Peng, Zhao Hong

    Buddha Country Mountain is about fifteen li north of Uijeongbu. Its left side is closely connected to the Gyeongwon (Seoul-Wonsan) Railway and the Gyeongseong (Seoul-Pyongyang) Highway, and its right side is connected to the highway leading to Yangju. The Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers is defending this mountain. After the first stage of the counterattack by the Chinese and Korean People's forces ended, part of the U.S. invading army's 1st Cavalry Division launched a fierce attack on the Buddha Country Mountain position on May 4th, attempting to pull out this wedge driven straight into Uijeongbu with aircraft and artillery. From the 4th, the enemy infantry, under the cover of tanks, continuously attacked the company's position for seven days and nights. On the last day, within thirteen hours, the enemy launched seven consecutive charges, but each time they were repulsed after suffering casualties.

    May 10th was the day that decided the outcome of the battle. At dawn on this day, more than a thousand enemy soldiers from the Yangju South Mountain detoured to the left side of Buddha Country Mountain. The enemy on the front also launched fierce attacks on the Ninth Company's position from three sides in turn, under the cover of more than ten aircraft, thirty tanks, and fourteen long-range guns. The Ninth Company's warriors fearlessly met the attack of the superior enemy in the fortifications they had repaired last night.

    Although the enemy used more than a dozen heavy artillery pieces to cover the attack, they still could not seize the position held by the Ninth Company's warriors. On the contrary, the Ninth Company repelled the enemy's charge with its sixty mortars. Once, the sixty mortar fired only one shell and hit the enemy ranks, causing the enemy to turn around and run. A burst of cheers erupted on the position.

    When the battle reached its final stage, the Ninth Company ran out of sixty mortar shells, leaving only some hand grenades. The warriors used hand grenades to defeat the enemy's seventh charge of two companies. The Second Squad and a machine gun team defended the fortification at the corner of the mountain. The enemy, using smoke screens, charged to the front of the fortification from three sides. At this time, even hand grenades could not be used. The warriors jumped out of the fortification and fought the enemy with bayonets, killing the enemies who charged up one by one at the front of the position.

    The enemy thought his superior firepower was formidable, but the Volunteer Army warriors looked down on it. The machine gun of Communist Party member Fan Haiting was filled with dirt from the enemy's artillery shells. His assistant, the young soldier Man Xuefeng, quickly wiped the gun clean. Fan Haiting took the gun and continued to fire at the enemy. He shot and said with a smile, "Xiao Man, did you see that? Several more enemies have fallen. The gun you cleaned is really good!" Although the enemy fired dozens or hundreds of shells at every turn, his infantry still fell by the dozens when they charged forward.

    By dusk, it had been a full thirteen hours. The enemy dared not charge again. It brought ten large trucks and dragged away the dead and wounded, fleeing in the direction of Uijeongbu. More than fifty enemy corpses lay on the front of the Ninth Company's position. The enemy, fearing being hit, dared not come to drag them away and ran away, abandoning them.

    The Ninth Company's warriors fought valiantly for seven days and nights, killing and wounding more than three hundred enemies, and the position remained unshaken. The Volunteer Army leadership specially awarded the company the honorary title of "Great Merit Company." (Xinhua News Agency)

　　佛国山上的英雄们
    于谦　林鹏　赵虹
    佛国山在议政府以北约十五华里，左侧与京（汉城）元（元山）铁路、京壤（平壤）公路紧紧相连，右侧是通往杨州的公路。守在这山上的是志愿军某部第九连。在中、朝人民部队反击战的第一阶段结束以后，美国侵略军骑兵第一师一部就于五月四日向佛国山阵地猛犯，妄想用飞机大炮拔去这颗直插议政府的楔子。从四日起，敌人步兵在坦克掩护之下向该连阵地连续猛攻了七昼夜。在最后一天的十三个小时内，敌人连续冲锋了七次，但每次都在遭受到杀伤以后败退了下去。
    五月十日，这是决定战斗胜负的一天。这一天拂晓，在杨州南山的敌军一千余人迂回到了佛国山左侧，正面的敌人也在十多架飞机、三十多辆坦克和十四门远射程炮掩护下从三面向九连阵地轮番猛扑。九连的勇士们在昨天晚上抢修好的工事里无畏地迎击着优势敌人的进攻。
    敌人虽然用十几门重炮来掩护进攻，可是仍然夺不去第九连勇士们所据守的阵地。相反，九连却用六零小炮打退了敌人的冲锋。有一次，六零炮只打出了一发炮弹，就打中了敌群，打得敌人扭头就跑。阵地上响起了一片欢呼声。
    当战斗进行到最后时，九连的六零炮弹打光了，只剩下些手榴弹。勇士们就用手榴弹打垮了敌人两个连的第七次冲锋。第二班和一个机枪组据守在靠山角的工事中，敌人借着烟幕从三面冲到了工事前沿。这时连手榴弹也无法使用了，勇士们就跳出工事和敌人拚刺刀，把冲上来的敌人一个一个地挑死在阵地前沿。
    敌人以为他的优势炮火了不起，志愿军勇士们却是那样地瞧不起它。共产党员范海亭的机枪被敌人炮弹打起来的土灌满了。他的助手青年战士满学丰迅速地把枪擦干净。范海亭接过枪继续打敌人。他一面射击，一面笑着说：“小满，你看见没有？敌人又倒了好几个。你擦的枪真不错呀！”敌人虽然动辄就打来几十发、几百发炮弹，可是他的步兵向前冲时还是几十个几十个地倒下去。
    到黄昏，已经整整打了十三个钟头。敌人不敢再冲锋了，它开来了十辆大卡车，拖着死的伤的往议政府方向逃窜了。在九连阵地的前沿还躺着五十多个敌人的死尸，敌人因为怕挨打，不敢来拖，丢下就跑了。
    九连的勇士们奋战七昼夜，杀伤敌人三百多，阵地屹然未动。志愿军领导机关特地授予该连“大功连”的光荣称号。（新华社）
