　　Convene the Japanese Peace Conference Early and Adhere to a Comprehensive Treaty
    Regarding the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet government submitted another note to the U.S. government on the 10th of this month. In the current fierce struggle over the Japanese peace treaty issue, this is a document of great significance. In this note, the Soviet government, in addition to upholding its consistent and just position on the Japanese peace treaty issue, refuting the rumors spread by the U.S. government, also put forward the positive proposal to hold a comprehensive Japanese peace conference in July or August of this year to conclude a comprehensive Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible. The Chinese people fully agree with the above-mentioned position and proposal of the Soviet government.
    The Soviet government's note further exposes the sinister intentions of the U.S. draft peace treaty with Japan, and no matter what lies it uses to try to cover it up, it will be in vain. Because the people of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the people of Asian and Australasian countries, including Japan, are opposed to the U.S. draft. In contrast, the Soviet government's proposal for a peace treaty with Japan, proposed on May 7th of this year and supported by China, has been warmly welcomed and supported by the people of the above-mentioned countries. This situation fully proves that the positions and attitudes of China and the Soviet Union on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty are completely just and selfless, and are the only way to peacefully resolve the Japanese issue and ensure peace in the Far East and Asia.
    This time, the Soviet government's note righteously accused the U.S. of its aggressive acts against China's sacred territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and firmly maintained that the above-mentioned territories must be returned to the People's Republic of China in accordance with the Cairo Declaration, otherwise, it should be held responsible for failing to fulfill the Cairo Declaration. At the same time, the note also refuted the U.S. government's vile slander against the Soviet Union. The U.S. government has once again fabricated the rumor that "the Soviet Union has controlled Northeast China." The U.S. government has fabricated such rumors more than once. This time, it has once again brought out this stale rumor in an attempt to provoke the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and to cover up its crimes of aggression against China's Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which only proves the extreme incompetence and shamelessness of the U.S. political swindlers. The great Sino-Soviet alliance cannot be shaken by any imperialist provocations. On the contrary, the Chinese people are fully aware that it is the U.S. imperialism that has been deliberately invading our Northeast for a long time and provoking Sino-Soviet relations. The facts revealed in the recent infighting within the United States are: in August 1945, General Wedemeyer, then stationed in China, suggested to the U.S. government three times to occupy parts of North China and Northeast China; in 1947, the same Wedemeyer, in his so-called report on the situation in China and Korea, suggested that our Northeast be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations controlled by the United States. This series of U.S. conspiracy plans to invade China suffered a shameful defeat due to the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Aren't these well-known facts?
    Regarding the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet government insists that it must be comprehensive, not separate. And what the United States is stepping up preparations for is precisely a separate, one-sided treaty. After the United States announced its unilaterally formulated draft peace treaty with Japan, it is now putting pressure on its vassal states such as Britain and France to force them to submit to the U.S. intentions and exclude our country's sacred right to participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan. It should be noted that our country has made great contributions and sacrifices in the war against Japan, and today it is a powerful country in Asia and a powerful force in defending peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to exclude China from the work of drafting a peace treaty with Japan that guarantees peace in the Far East. The Soviet Union and China have repeatedly solemnly declared that any peace treaty with Japan that is prepared and drafted without the participation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, no matter what its content and results, is illegal and therefore invalid. The Japanese peace treaty monopolized by the United States is only to establish a new aggressive bloc in the Far East and expand aggressive wars, which is firmly opposed by the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of Asian and Australasian countries. Therefore, only by holding a meeting of the four foreign ministers with the participation of representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement, and with the participation of all countries that fought against Japan, to jointly draft and prepare the peace treaty with Japan, can peace in the Far East be restored and consolidated. This is a natural and unshakable principle; without this principle, there can be no real peace treaty with Japan.
    The peaceful settlement of the Japanese issue and the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan can no longer be delayed. The Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of Asian and Australasian countries must unanimously support the consistent position of China and the Soviet Union in adhering to the early conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, so as to consolidate peace in the Far East and the whole world.

### 早开对日和会，坚持全面和约

　　早开对日和会，坚持全面和约
    关于对日和约问题，苏联政府于本月十日再一次向美国政府提交了一件照会。在当前对日和约问题的激烈斗争中，这是一个具有重大意义的文件。苏联政府在这次照会中，除了坚持其在对日和约问题上的一贯的、公正的主张、驳斥美国政府所造谣言外，并提出了在今年七月或八月举行全面对日和会，以便早日缔结全面对日和约的积极性的建议。中国人民完全同意苏联政府上述的主张和建议。
    苏联政府的照会，进一步地揭露了美国对日和约草案的险恶目的，无论它用什么谎言来企图掩盖，都是白费力气。因为，中苏两国人民以及包括日本在内的亚澳各国人民，都是反对美国草案的。而与此相反，苏联政府于本年五月七日所提出，并为中国所支持的对日和约的建议，却受到了上述各国人民所热烈欢迎与拥护。这种情形，充分证明了中苏两国关于对日和约问题的主张和态度是完全公正无私的，并且是和平解决日本问题、确保远东和亚洲和平的唯一的道路。
    苏联政府这一次的照会，义正词严地指责了美国对中国神圣领土台湾和澎湖列岛的侵略行为，并坚决主张上述领土必须按照开罗宣言的规定，归还给中华人民共和国，否则，即应负没有履行开罗宣言的责任。同时，照会也驳斥了美国政府诽谤苏联的卑鄙的谰言。美国政府又一次造谣说：“苏联已经控制了中国的东北”。美国政府制造这类谣言，早已不只一次了。这一次又搬出这个陈腐不堪的谣言来，企图挑拨中苏两国牢不可破的友谊，并掩饰它侵略中国的台湾和澎湖列岛的罪行，只不过证明美国政治骗子们的万分低能和无耻而已。伟大的中苏同盟，是任何帝国主义的挑拨诡计所不能动摇的。相反的，中国人民完全清楚地知道，长久以来蓄意侵略我国东北的，正是挑拨中苏关系的美国帝国主义。最近在美国内部的争吵中所透露出的事实是：一九四五年八月，美国当时驻在中国的将军魏德迈，即曾三次建议美国政府占领我国华北及东北的一部分；一九四七年，同一个魏德迈又在所谓关于中国和朝鲜情况的报告中，建议把我国的东北，置于美国所操纵的联合国的托管之下。这一连串美国侵略中国的阴谋计划，由于中国人民革命的伟大胜利，才遭到了可耻的失败。这些难道不是众所周知的事实吗？
    关于对日和约的缔结，苏联政府坚持必须是全面的，而不是单独的。而美国正在加紧准备的，恰正是单独的片面的和约。美国在公布了它单独制订的对日和约草案以后，现正在对英、法等仆从国家施用压力，使之屈从美国的意图，排除我国参加拟制对日和约的神圣权利。须知我国在对日作战中作了伟大的贡献和牺牲，在今天又是亚洲的强大国家，是保卫远东和世界和平的强大力量，因而在拟制保障远东和平的对日和约的工作中，把中国排除在外，是绝不能容许的。苏联和中国曾一再郑重声明，没有中华人民共和国参加准备和拟制的对日和约，无论其内容与结果如何，一概是非法的，因而也是无效的。美国一手包办的对日和约，只是为了要在远东建立新的侵略集团和扩大侵略战争，这是中国人民、日本人民和亚澳各国人民所坚决反对的。因此，只有按照波茨坦协定所规定的程序，举行有中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表所参加的四国外长会议，并由一切对日作战国家参加，共同拟制和准备对日和约，才能恢复和巩固远东的和平。这是天经地义的、不可动摇的原则；离开了这个原则，就不可能有真正的对日和约。
    日本问题的和平解决和全面对日和约的签订，已是绝对不能再拖延的了。中国人民、日本人民及亚澳各国人民，必须一致拥护中苏两国历来一贯坚持的早日缔结全面对日和约的主张，以巩固远东和全世界的和平。
