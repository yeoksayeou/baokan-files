Jilin Jiaohe Bao'an Village
Evaluates Results of Patriotic Production Increase Competition

　　After the spring plowing concluded in late May, Bao'an Village, 14th District, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, conducted an evaluation of the village's Patriotic Production Increase Competition. The evaluation further enhanced the peasants' enthusiasm for the production increase competition. The village originally planned to start summer weeding before the Grain in Ear solar term, but it has now been advanced by three days. Manure collection has also begun. Many mutual aid groups have proposed to cultivate more extensively during summer weeding, striving for meticulous cultivation and fighting against various diseases and insect pests.

The content of this evaluation in the village was to examine the completion of the Patriotic Production Increase Competition plan and the implementation of production policies. During the evaluation, the specific conditions for model groups were determined as follows: (1) The area sown with commercial grain and industrial raw material crops should account for more than 65 percent of the total cultivated land of the group; (2) The fertilized area should account for more than 75 percent of the total cultivated land area of the group (averaging 40 cartloads per hectare); (3) All soybeans should be either seed-selected or exchanged for improved varieties, and germination tests should be conducted; (4) Deep plowing and fine cultivation should be achieved; (5) All labor force in the group should participate in production, with reasonable division of labor and integration of agriculture and sideline occupations; (6) Obey leadership, the whole group should be united, and respond to various government calls (the selection conditions for model households and individual models are roughly the same). Those who achieve all six of the above are rated as first-class model groups, those who achieve five of them are rated as second-class model groups, and those who achieve four or three of them are rated as third-class model groups. (Editor's note: The sixth condition for model conditions: "Responding to the government's call" is a very important condition. Combining the effort to achieve a bumper harvest with responding to all government calls is the basic content of the Patriotic Production Increase Movement. Therefore, responding to all government calls should be listed as a necessary condition for a model mutual aid group in the Patriotic Production Increase Movement. Bao'an Village did not emphasize this point as a necessary condition when defining the grade of the model group, which is not correct.) As a result of the evaluation, 121 out of 123 households in the village completed or exceeded the original plan, and one first-class model group, three second and third-class model groups each were selected; nine first-class individual models, twenty-nine second-class and eight third-class; and two model families. Through this selection, some of the masses' misconceptions about the competition were corrected. He Yongsheng, a farmer in Dadianzi Tun, said: "I used to think: what competition, isn't it all about Han En's group! They are models every year, who can catch up! After this evaluation, I know that anyone who does a good job can be selected." Li Gui, a farmer in Xinli Tun, used to think that it was enough to make a challenge, but as a result, none of the conditions were met. He expressed his regret after the evaluation and was determined to catch up with others. Because farmers have a better understanding of the competition, the summer weeding competition has been launched more vigorously, laying the foundation for long-term competition.

In the process of this evaluation, the following problems have occurred: (1) Some groups initially did not understand the significance of the evaluation, and could not overcome personal feelings, and were unwilling to evaluate seriously. Farmers in Tang Youlin's group in Xinli Tun said: "It's all about the same, there's nothing to evaluate, just pick one." After the village cadres had individual talks with the activists in the group to enlighten them, they broke the emotional ties and seriously carried out the evaluation. (2) Some groups failed to grasp the main aspects of the evaluation, and only focused on minor matters. Some groups emphasized objective reasons when they failed to complete their tasks. There were also individual group leaders who had the idea of relying on county and district cadres for evaluation. In order to correct these deviations, the leaders paid attention to inspiring everyone to conduct evaluations around the evaluation conditions, and guided the groups to fully promote democracy, and repeatedly conducted evaluations based on the results of the village's spring plowing inspection.

### 吉林蛟河保安村评比爱国丰产竞赛成绩

　　吉林蛟河保安村
　  评比爱国丰产竞赛成绩
    吉林蛟河县十四区保安村，在五月下旬春耕结束以后，进行全村爱国丰产竞赛的评比工作。经过评比，更加提高了农民对于丰产竞赛的热情。该村原计划在芒种前开始夏锄，现已提前三天。积肥工作也已开始。许多互助组提出，在夏锄中多铲多趟，细铲细趟，并要向各种病虫灾害作斗争。
    该村这次评比工作的内容，是检查爱国丰产竞赛计划的完成程度和生产政策的执行情况。在评比时，确定了模范组的具体条件是：（一）播种商品粮和工业原料作物的面积，应占全组耕地总数的百分之六十五以上；（二）施肥面积占全组耕地总面积百分之七十五以上（每垧平均施四十车）；（三）大豆做到全部粒选或全部调换为优良品种，并作发芽试验；（四）做到深耕细作；（五）全组所有劳动力全部参加生产，合理分工，农副业结合；（六）服从领导，全组团结，响应政府各种号召（模范户与个人模范的评选条件，与此大致相同）。以上六条都作到的，评为一等模范组，作到其中五条的为二等模范组，作到其中四条或三条的为三等模范组。（编者按：模范条件的第六条：“响应政府号召”是很重要的一个条件。把争取粮食丰产与响应政府一切号召结合起来，就是爱国丰产运动的基本内容。所以，响应政府一切号召，应列为爱国丰产运动模范互助组的必具条件。保安村在规定模范组的等级时，没有将这一点强调为必要条件，这是不对的。）评比结果，全村一百二十三户中，有一百二十一户完成或超过了原订计划，选出一等模范组一个，二、三等模范组各三个；一等个人模范九名，二等二十九名，三等八名；模范家庭两户。经过这次评选，纠正了群众对竞赛的一些错误认识。大甸子屯农民何永胜说：“以前我寻思：什么竞赛不竞赛，还不是韩恩组的事！人家年年是模范，谁赶得上！这一评，我知道凡是干得好的都能当选了。”新立屯农民李贵过去认为提出挑战就算完事了，结果，什么条件也没完成。他在评比后表示很后悔，决心赶上别人。因为农民对竞赛有了认识，夏锄竞赛已更有力地开展起来，打下了长年竞赛的基础。
    在这次评比过程中，曾发生过以下一些问题：（一）有些组最初不了解评比的意义，打不破私人情面，不肯认真评比。新立屯唐有林组的农民说：“都差不多，没啥评的，举一个算了。”经过村干部找该组的积极分子个别谈话，进行启发以后，才打破了情面，认真展开评比。（二）有些组抓不住评比的主要方面，只在细小事情上打圈子。有的组完不成任务就强调客观原因。还有个别组长有依靠县、区干部评比的思想。为了纠正这些偏向，领导者曾注意启发大家围绕评比条件展开评比，并引导各组充分发扬民主，以全村的春耕检查结果作为依据，反复进行评比。
