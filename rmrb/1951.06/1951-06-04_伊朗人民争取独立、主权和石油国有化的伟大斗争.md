　　The Great Struggle of the Iranian People for Independence, Sovereignty, and Oil Nationalization
　　Shen Rong
　　Iran, formerly known as Parthia, was also called Persia. It has an area of over 1,640,000 square kilometers and a population of 17 million. The vast majority of residents are Muslims, with farmers and herders accounting for more than 80% of the total population. For a long time, the Iranian people have been under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudal forces.

　　Iran is rich in oil. Incomplete estimates place Iran's oil reserves at 900 million tons, accounting for 10% of the world's oil reserves. The current annual oil production is about 30 million tons, ranking fourth in the world.

　　However, Iran's abundant oil production is largely controlled by a British company—the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). Like a giant leech, it sucks Iran's oil and the blood and sweat of the Iranian people. The company's origin is as follows: In 1901, a British man named D'Arcy discovered Iran's oil resources. He bought the oil exploitation rights in a vast area of Iran for a meager price of $20,000. In 1909, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935) was officially established. In 1933, with the support of British military force, the company forced Iran to sign an agreement, obtaining a 60-year patent on oil exploitation in the important oil-producing areas of southern Iran. Currently, this company has a capital of 200 million pounds and operates in an area of over 100,000 square kilometers. The company's refinery in Abadan, southern Iran, is the largest refinery in the world, with a daily refining capacity of 70,000 tons.

　　Through the blood-sucking tube of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, British imperialism extracts huge profits from the Iranian people every day. According to the Iranian "Tehran News," the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company extracted 268,743,000 tons of oil from Iran from 1912 to 1949, according to its own published statistics. Assuming each ton of oil is worth $18, Britain extracted more than $4.837 billion from Iran in 37 years. The newspaper estimates that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's annual oil sales revenue is $486 million, while payments to Iran are less than $20 million. According to the agreement, the company only pays the Iranian government four shillings for every ton of oil extracted!

　　Not only that, but the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company actually controls Iranian politics. The changes in the Iranian cabinet in the past are often inseparable from the conspiracies of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which controls the economic lifeline of Iran, is also a conspiracy center for interfering in Iran's internal affairs.

　　American imperialism has also been coveting Iranian oil for a long time. In addition to completely monopolizing Saudi Arabia's oil production, American oil tycoons seized the oil exploitation rights of the Bahrain Islands, belonging to Iran, as early as 1933. According to materials published by the Soviet Labor Daily on April 24 this year, American-operated oil currently accounts for more than 20% of Iran's annual oil production. Since 1949, the Truman government has included Iran in the so-called "military aid" program in order to turn Iran into an anti-Soviet base, and has sent a large number of "experts" to Iran to carry out activities.

　　Due to the cruel exploitation by British and American imperialism, the lives of the Iranian people are extremely difficult. Unemployment and hunger are prevalent throughout the country. An Iranian reactionary newspaper admitted that there are currently one million unemployed people in Iran. Iranian oil workers work 12 to 16 hours a day, and their wages are only one to three tomans (Iranian currency) for adults, which is not enough to maintain a half-starved life. Child laborers earn even less. The workers live in very dirty and crowded basements, living, as the current Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh admits, "a primitive cave-dwelling life."

　　The Iranian people are unwilling to be slaves of imperialism. For a long time, they have been fighting against imperialism and striving for oil nationalization. Since March of this year, this struggle has intensified throughout Iran. The call for oil nationalization put forward by the Iranian People's Party (formerly translated as the Masses Party) in February immediately won the support of all Iranian patriots. They organized the Iranian "National Association for the Struggle Against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company" to lead the Iranian people in a heroic struggle. Starting on March 20, 20,000 workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Abadan, southern Iran, went on strike. On March 28, all textile workers in Isfahan held a sympathy strike. On April 13, 40,000 working people in Tehran held a mass meeting in the square in front of the parliament to support the striking workers. On April 22, 20,000 students in Tehran held a demonstration parade despite the Iranian authorities' ban. On April 15 and 16, the striking workers in Abadan held successive demonstrations, shouting slogans against British and American imperialism. The anti-imperialist struggle for oil nationalization has united all patriotic people in Iran.

　　Under the strong pressure of the Iranian people, the Iranian parliament had to pass a bill to implement oil nationalization at the end of April. This bill failed to completely nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in accordance with the will of the people. For example, the bill stipulates that the property of British privilege holders will not be confiscated, but only the management rights of the company will be transferred to the Iranian government. The bill not only promises that all British technicians will continue to serve as usual, but also promises to deposit 25% of the company's income into the Iranian National Bank or a bank agreed upon by both parties to meet the possible demands of British privilege holders.

　　Even so, British imperialism is still not satisfied with this bill, and the rise of the Iranian people's power has greatly shocked British and American imperialists. On March 28, Britain ordered two warships to sail to the Persian Gulf. On May 19, the British government issued a strongly worded note to the Iranian government, considering the oil nationalization bill passed by the Iranian parliament to be "illegal" and "unilateral." The note threatened that if the Iranian government were to "unilaterally" implement oil nationalization, it would cause "the most serious consequences." On May 25, Britain again ordered its 16th Independent Parachute Brigade to go to the Eastern Mediterranean, actively preparing for armed intervention.

　　After the issue of oil nationalization in Iran occurred, the United States began to believe that this was a great opportunity for the United States to replace British influence in Iran. The United States once supported the Iranian government in nationalizing oil. To this end, American agents assassinated former Iranian Prime Minister Razmara on March 7, who did not support oil nationalization. When British newspapers revealed that Britain hoped to resolve the oil dispute by dividing the profits of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company equally with Iran, a representative of the American Texaco Oil Company immediately issued a statement saying that if the company operated Iranian oil, it would be prepared to give the Iranian government 60% of the profits. A spokesman for New York Mobil Oil Company rushed to say that his company was prepared to give the Iranian government 65%. And the American Arabian American Oil Company overwhelmed the previous two companies, saying it was willing to pay 72%!

　　However, the United States quickly discovered that the strength of the Iranian people was very strong. They not only demanded the recovery of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but also demanded the recovery of the American oil company in the Bahrain Islands. To this end, the Iranian people specially renamed the Iranian "National Association for the Struggle Against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company" to the Iranian "National Association for the Struggle Against Imperialist Oil Companies." In this case, the United States turned to colluding with Britain, demanding that the Iranian government consider the difficulties of implementing oil nationalization and avoid taking "unilateral" actions. The American ambassador to Iran, Grady, is currently trying to act as a mediator to conduct "mediation" between Britain and Iran in order to obtain more benefits for the United States.

　　At present, the Iranian struggle for oil nationalization is still continuing to develop. On this issue, there are two different lines within Iran. One is the line of the Iranian government. The oil nationalization advocated by the Iranian government is incomplete. For the benefit of feudal bureaucrats and the bourgeoisie, it attempts to use the power of the people to take the oil into its own hands to some extent, obtain more profits, to solve its financial crisis and consolidate its rule. On the other hand, it is very afraid of the people and implements a military reign of terror throughout the country, issuing martial law in Khuzestan, prohibiting workers from gathering and demonstrating. Obviously, if the Iranian government continues to adopt this policy of suppressing the people, it will inevitably make it unable to resist the united pressure of the imperialists, and can only pave the way for surrender and compromise. The reason why the Iranian government has not dared to openly compromise is due to the supervision of the powerful Iranian people's forces. The Iranian government acknowledged this in a memorandum to American Ambassador Grady on May 21. The memorandum said: "The law on oil nationalization has been passed by the Iranian parliament, and the government has to implement this law because the government considered that if there is any negligence in the implementation of this task, it will cause the anger of the Iranian people."

　　The other line is the line of all Iranian patriots, and also the line of the Iranian People's Party. They advocate immediately nationalizing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company without compensation, and nationalizing the American Bahrain Oil Company; eliminating the influence of British and American imperialism in Iran; guaranteeing the freedom and rights of the people, releasing political prisoners, and allowing all trade unions and parties to operate freely; abolishing martial law and all military courts. Obviously, only by implementing these demands of the Iranian people can the Iranian oil issue be truly and thoroughly resolved, and can Iran get rid of the shackles of imperialism and embark on the road of independence, democracy, peace, and prosperity.

　　伊朗人民争取独立、主权和石油国有化的伟大斗争
    沈容
    伊朗古名安息国，亦曾称波斯。它的面积是一百六十四万余平方公里，人口一千七百万。绝大部分居民都是回教徒，农民和畜牧者占全人口的百分之八十以上。长时期以来，伊朗人民一直是处在帝国主义与封建势力的双重压迫之下。
    伊朗盛产石油。伊朗石油的蕴藏量据不完全的估计有九万万吨，占全世界石油蕴藏量的百分之十。现在每年产油约三千万吨，占世界产量的第四位。
    但是，伊朗这样丰富的石油出产，却绝大部分操纵在一家英国公司——英伊石油公司手里。它像一只大爬虫一样，吮吸着伊朗的油和伊朗人民的血汗。这个公司的来历是这样的：一九○一年，有一个名叫大赛的英国人，发现了伊朗的石油富源。他以二万美元的低廉价格，买得了伊朗广大地区的石油开采权。一九○九年，英波石油公司（一九三五年改名为英伊石油公司）正式成立。一九三三年，该公司在英国武力的支持下，强迫伊朗订立一个协定，取得了伊朗南部重要产油区的六十年的开采专利权。现在，这个公司拥有二亿英镑的资金，经营的地区超过十万平方公里。该公司设在伊朗南部阿巴丹的炼油厂，是世界最大的炼油厂，每天的炼油量达七万吨。
    英帝国主义者经过英伊石油公司的吸血管，每天从伊朗人民身上榨取巨大的利润。据伊朗《台那报》载，按照英伊石油公司自己公布的统计数字，从一九一二年到一九四九年，英伊石油公司从伊朗汲取了二六八、七四三、○○○吨的石油，假定每吨油以十八美元计算，那么在三十七年间，英国即从伊朗榨取了四十八亿三千七百余万美元。该报估计，目前英伊石油公司每年出售石油的收入是四亿八千六百万美元，而支付给伊朗的不足二千万美元。按照协定，该公司每采出一吨石油，才付给伊朗政府四个先令！
    不仅如此，英伊石油公司实际上还操纵着伊朗的政治。伊朗历届内阁的变动，往往是和英伊石油公司的阴谋分不开的。操纵伊朗经济命脉的英伊石油公司，同时又是干涉伊朗内政的一个阴谋中心。
    美帝国主义对于伊朗的石油，也一直是垂涎三尺的。美国石油财阀除了完全独占沙特阿拉伯的石油生产外，早在一九三三年就攫取了伊属巴林群岛的石油开采权。据苏联劳动报今年四月二十四日发表的材料：美国目前在伊朗开采的石油，已占伊朗石油年产量百分之二十以上。一九四七年，新泽西和纽约的美孚油公司和英伊公司签订一个协定，规定后者应把它出售的石油的百分之四十，卖给上述两个美国公司。同时，为了把伊朗变成一个反苏基地，杜鲁门政府自一九四九年起，就把伊朗列入所谓“军事援助”的对象中，并派了大批“专家”到伊朗去进行活动。
    由于英美帝国主义的残酷剥削，伊朗人民的生活极为困苦。失业和饥饿遍于全国。伊朗一个反动报纸承认，伊朗全国现有一百万人失业。伊朗的石油工人每天要做十二小时至十六小时的工作，而所得工资成年人只有一个土曼到三个土曼（伊币），还不够维持一个人半饥半饱的生活。童工的工资更少。工人们居住在十分肮脏而拥挤的地窑里，像伊朗现任总理摩萨台所承认的，他们是过着“原始的穴居野处的生活”。
    伊朗人民是不愿做帝国主义的奴隶的。他们长时期以来，就在进行着反对帝国主义与争取石油国有化的斗争。今年三月以来，这个斗争在伊朗全国更加高涨起来。伊朗人民党（前译为群众党）二月提出的石油国有化的号召，立即获得伊朗一切爱国分子的拥护。他们组织了伊朗“反对英伊石油公司斗争全国协会”，领导伊朗人民进行英勇的斗争。三月二十日开始，伊朗南部阿巴丹的英伊石油公司两万工人举行罢工。三月二十八日，伊斯法罕的全部纺织工人，举行同情罢工。四月十三日，德黑兰的劳动人民四万人，在国会前面的广场上举行群众大会，支援罢工的工人。二十二日，德黑兰的学生两万人不顾伊朗当局的禁令，举行示威游行。四月十五日和十六日，阿巴丹的罢工工人连续举行了示威游行，高喊反对英、美帝国主义的口号。要求石油国有化的反帝斗争，已把伊朗一切爱国人民都团结起来了。
    在伊朗人民强大的压力下，伊朗国会不得不在四月底通过了实施石油国有化的法案。这一法案并未能完全按照人民的意志，彻底地将英伊石油公司收归国有。例如法案规定不没收英国特权所有者的财产，而只是把该公司的管理权，交由伊朗政府接收。法案不但允诺英国技师全部照常供职，而且允诺将公司收益的百分之二十五，存入伊朗国家银行或双方同意的银行，以满足英国特权所有者可能提出的要求。
    虽然如此，英帝国主义仍然不满意于这个法案，而伊朗人民力量的兴起，更使英、美帝国主义者大为震惊。三月二十八日，英国下令两艘军舰开往波斯湾。五月十九日，英国政府向伊朗政府提出一个措辞强硬的照会，认为伊朗国会通过的石油国有化法案是“非法的”、“片面的”。照会威胁说：如果伊朗政府要“片面地”实行石油国有，那就会引起“最严重的后果”。五月二十五日，英国再命令它的伞兵第十六独立旅开赴东地中海，积极准备武装干涉。
    在伊朗这次石油国有化的问题发生后，美国开始认为这是美国代替英国在伊朗的势力的大好机会。美国曾一度支持伊朗政府把石油收归国有。为此，美国的特务曾在三月七日暗杀了不赞成石油国有化的前伊朗首相拉兹玛拉。当英国的报纸透露，英国希望与伊朗平分英伊石油公司的利润来解决石油争端时，美国德士古油公司的一个代表马上发表声明说，该公司如果经营伊朗石油，准备分给伊朗政府以利润的百分之六十。纽约美孚油公司的一个发言人又抢着说：他的公司准备分给伊朗政府百分之六十五。而美国的阿拉伯美国石油公司又压倒了前两个公司，说它愿意出百分之七十二！
    但是，美国很快发现了：伊朗人民的力量十分强大。他们不仅要求收回英伊石油公司，而且也要求收回美国在巴林群岛上的石油公司。为此，伊朗人民曾特别把伊朗“反英伊石油公司斗争全国协会”，改名为伊朗“反对帝国主义石油公司斗争全国协会”。在这种情况下，美国就转而和英国狼狈为奸，要求伊朗政府考虑实行石油国有化的困难，避免采取“片面”的行动。美国驻伊大使格拉第，现正力图以调解人的姿态，在英、伊之间进行“调处”，以便从中为美国取得更多的利益。
    目前，伊朗争取石油国有化的斗争仍在继续发展中。在这个问题上，伊朗内部存在着两条不同的路线。一条是伊朗政府的路线。伊朗政府所主张的石油国有化是不彻底的。它为着封建官僚与资产阶级的利益，企图利用人民的力量，把石油在某种程度上拿到自己手里来，多得一些利润，来解决它的财政危机，巩固它的统治。另一方面，它又非常害怕人民，并在全国实行军事的恐怖统治，在库齐斯坦颁布戒严令，不准工人集会和示威。显然地，伊朗政府如果继续采取这种压制人民的政策，就必然使得它无法抵抗帝国主义者的联合压力，而只能为投降妥协开辟道路。伊朗政府目前之所以未敢公然妥协，那是由于强大的伊朗人民力量监督的原故。伊朗政府在五月二十一日致美国大使格拉第的备忘录中，承认了这一点。备忘录说：“石油国有化的法律，已经伊朗国会通过，政府只得实行这个法律，因为政府考虑到：如果对执行这个任务稍有怠误，就会引起伊朗人民的愤怒。”
    另一条路线是伊朗一切爱国者的路线，也是伊朗人民党的路线。他们主张立即把英伊石油公司无偿地收归国有，把美国的巴林石油公司收归国有；肃清英美帝国主义在伊朗的势力；保障人民的自由权利，释放政治犯，准许各工会与党派自由活动；取消戒严令和一切军事法庭。显然地，只有实行伊朗人民的这些要求，才能真正彻底解决伊朗的石油问题，才能使伊朗摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，走上独立、民主、和平与繁荣的道路。
