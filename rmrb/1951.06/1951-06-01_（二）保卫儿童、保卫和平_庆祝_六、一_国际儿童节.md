　　(II) Defend Children, Defend Peace
    —Celebrating "June 1st" International Children's Day
    Today is International Children's Day. Children all over China and the world are welcoming this festival with joy. At the same time, peace-loving people all over the world are engaged in a great and just struggle to defend world peace and protect the happiness and safety of children.
    Children are the flowers of humanity and the masters of a future beautiful society. A peaceful and happy environment and the love and democratic education of the state and society are, like air, sunshine, and water to the flowers of spring, necessary conditions for the free growth of children. In the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries of Europe, children are fully enjoying this beautiful and happy life. In New China, thanks to the great success of the people's revolution and the brilliant victory of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle, children have also begun to embark on the road to a better life and are receiving the cordial care and love of the state and government, creating conditions for their even happier tomorrow. However, the fate of children around the world is not the same everywhere today. Especially in countries ravaged by imperialist wars of aggression, and in those countries that frantically follow the United States in expanding their armaments and preparing for war, there is not only no happiness in children's lives, but they are also subjected to terrible devastation, exploitation, and inhuman torture and murder. In Korea, as a result of the bloody war of aggression waged by US imperialism, and its most brutal atrocities against the peaceful people and children of Korea, millions of children lose their lives or their parents and families every day. Millions of children in Vietnam, Malaya, and other colonies and dependent countries are also constantly threatened by war and famine. In the United States and other imperialist countries, the lives of children are increasingly impoverished due to the oppression of the war economy, and war profiteers shamelessly instill racial hatred in children, hoping that they will become blind soldiers in the future to serve as cannon fodder in wars of aggression. The disasters of war and the threat of war are thus massively harming the lovely flowers of humanity—the children of many countries! This situation has aroused the boundless anger of peace-loving people all over the world—good fathers and mothers.
    To defend children and the happy lives of our next generation, we must defend world peace and eliminate the threat of war. When the International Democratic Women's Federation issued its decision to celebrate International Children's Day in 1949, it called for "struggling for peace and defending children's rights." In February of this year, the Berlin Conference of the Council of the International Democratic Women's Federation made a resolution to strengthen and expand the movement to protect children, calling on all men and women who love children to launch a wider movement on this year's International Children's Day to protect children from the threat of war. This call has been warmly responded to and supported by peace-loving people all over the world who love, care for, and are concerned about children's rights. The widespread development of the movement to protect children will enable more kind and upright parents to join the ranks of defending peace, which is of great significance to the struggle to stop new wars and defend world peace.
    Under the call of the great Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, Chinese children are participating in the struggle to defend peace with their own practical actions. Chinese children, living a peaceful and happy life under the protection of the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers, also actively participated in the great patriotic movement of Resist-America, Aid-Korea. They enthusiastically wrote letters of condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, made comfort bags, and children in Tianjin, Beijing, and Suzhou even assisted the government in arresting special agents. Children in Nanjing collected scrap iron and donated it to the People's Government. Children in Beijing Yucai Middle School saved more than one million snacks money and bought a "Yucai Junior Team Anti-American Assault Rifle" and presented it to General Kim Il-sung, asking him to forward it to the most heroic soldiers in Korea. Chinese children have already taken their own practical actions to participate in the struggle to defend peace and defend their own happy lives.
    In order to promote the spirit of patriotism of the children of New China, and cultivate them so that they can shoulder the historical task of defending and building the great motherland in the future, they must be given full patriotic education, so that all Chinese children love their motherland, love their people, and should call on them to study hard and exercise their bodies to serve the great motherland.
    At present, peace and war are engaged in a fierce struggle everywhere in the world. Peace-loving people of all countries—good and upright parents and children—must unite and resolutely oppose wars of aggression in order to defend peace and defend the happy future of mankind.

　　（二）保卫儿童、保卫和平
    ——庆祝“六、一”国际儿童节
    今天是国际儿童节。全中国和全世界的儿童，都怀着欢悦的心情，来迎接这个节日。同时，全世界爱好和平的人民，正在为着保卫世界和平，保卫儿童的幸福与安全，进行着伟大的正义的斗争。
    儿童是人类的花朵，是未来美好社会的主人。和平幸福的环境与国家社会的抚爱和民主教育，正如空气、阳光、水之对于春天的花朵一样，是儿童们自由生长的必要条件。在苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家里，儿童们正充分享受着这种美满幸福的生活。在新中国，由于人民革命的伟大成功和抗美援朝斗争的辉煌胜利，儿童们也已开始走上了美好生活的道路，并受到国家和政府的亲切关怀与爱护，而为他们的更加幸福的明天创造着条件。但是，在今天，全世界儿童的遭遇，并不到处都是一样的。尤其是在被帝国主义的侵略战争所蹂躏着的国家里，以及那些追随美国疯狂进行扩军备战的国家里，儿童的生活中不但没有幸福可言，而且是遭受着可怕的摧残、榨取、和惨无人道的非刑酷打和杀害。在朝鲜，由于美帝国主义进行了血腥的侵略战争，并以最残暴的兽行对待朝鲜的和平人民和儿童，每天都有千千万万的儿童丧失了生命或者失掉了他们的父母与家庭。在越南、马来亚及其他殖民地与附属国家的千百万儿童，也随时受着战争和饥饿的威胁。在美国及其他的帝国主义国家，儿童的生活由于备战经济的压迫而日益陷于贫困，并且战争贩子们还无耻地对儿童们灌输着种族仇恨，希望他们将来成为盲目的兵士，以充当侵略战争的炮灰。战争的灾害和战争的威胁，就这样大规模地残害着可爱的人类的花朵——许多国家的儿童们！这种情况，已引起了世界爱好和平的人们——善良的父亲和母亲们的无比愤怒。
    要保卫儿童，保卫我们下一代的幸福生活，就必须保卫世界和平，消灭战争的威胁。一九四九年国际民主妇女联合会发出庆祝国际儿童节的决定时，即曾号召“为争取和平，保卫儿童权利而斗争”。今年二月，国际民主妇联理事会柏林会议更作出了加强与扩大保卫儿童运动的决议，号召一切爱护儿童的男女，于今年的国际儿童节展开更广泛的运动，保卫儿童，使他们不受战争的威胁。这一号召，已获得了全世界爱好和平、爱护与关切儿童权利的人们的热烈响应与拥护。保卫儿童运动的广泛展开，将使得更多的善良正直的父母们加入到保卫和平的队伍中来，对于制止新战争、保卫世界和平的斗争，是有着重大的意义的。
    中国儿童在伟大的抗美援朝运动的号召下，正以自己的实际行动来参加保卫和平的斗争。在中国人民志愿军英雄的战斗的保护下，过着和平幸福生活的中国儿童，也积极地参加了抗美援朝的伟大爱国运动。他们热烈地给中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军写慰问信，做慰问袋，天津、北京、苏州的儿童并曾协助政府捉拿特务，南京的儿童搜集废铁捐献给人民政府，北京育英中学的儿童曾节省了一百多万零食钱，买了一支“育英少年队抗美冲锋枪”，献给金日成将军，请他转送给朝鲜最英勇的战士。中国儿童已经以自己的实际行动，来参加保卫和平与保卫自己幸福生活的斗争。
    为了发扬新中国儿童爱国主义的精神，培养他们，使他们将来能担负起保卫和建设伟大的祖国的历史任务，必须对于他们进行充分的爱国主义的教育，使全中国儿童都热爱自己的祖国，热爱自己的人民，并且应当号召他们努力学习和锻炼身体，以为伟大的祖国服务。
    目前，在世界各处，和平与战争正在进行着激烈的斗争。各国爱好和平的人们——善良正直的父母们，儿童们，必须团结起来，坚决反对侵略战争，以保卫和平，保卫人类幸福的未来。
