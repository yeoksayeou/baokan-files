Oppose the Physical Punishment of Workers at the Jinan Locomotive Depot

(I) To the Editors:
    After reading the report in the "Reader's Letters Page" of the People's Daily on June 20th about the Jinan Locomotive Depot of the Jinan Railway Administration infringing upon human rights and physically punishing workers, we were very angry. We agree with the editors' expressed opinion. We demand that the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the depot conduct self-criticism among the staff and workers, examine the thoughts and work styles of not relying on the working class, and make a summary to be published in the newspaper.

(II) To the Editors:
    I saw the news about the Jinan Locomotive Depot of the Jinan Railway Administration infringing upon human rights and physically punishing workers in the "Reader's Letters Page" of the People's Daily on June 20th. I believe this is an extremely bad behavior. This matter shows that some leaders of the depot still retain the bad thoughts and habits of oppressing and humiliating workers like the reactionary ruling class in the old society. This kind of behavior is absolutely not allowed to exist in our people's railway. I believe that the Jinan Railway Administration and relevant leading organs should immediately carry out the following tasks: (1) Investigate responsibility and give strict punishment to the personnel involved. (2) Apologize to and express condolences to the workers who were physically punished. (3) The leading organs should publish the results of the handling in the People's Daily to educate everyone.

　　反对济南机务段体罚工人
  （一）编辑同志：
    看了六月二十日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊登的济南铁路管理局济南机务段侵犯人权、体罚工人的报道后，我们非常气愤。我们同意编者表示的意见。我们要求该段党、行政、工会、青年团向职工进行自我批评，检查不依靠工人阶级的思想和作风，并作出总结，在报上公布。

  （二）编辑同志：
    在六月二十日人民日报“读者来信专页”上，我看到济南铁路管理局济南机务段侵犯人权、体罚工人的消息。我认为这是一种极端恶劣的行为。这件事情说明，该段某些领导人员还保留着类似旧社会反动统治阶级那种压迫污辱工人的坏思想，坏习气。这种作风，在我们人民的铁路中是绝不容许存在的。我认为济南铁路管理局及有关领导机关，应该立即进行下列几个工作：（一）追究责任，对有关人员分别给以严格处分。（二）向受体罚的工友道歉及进行慰问。（三）领导机关将处理结果在人民日报上公布，以便教育大家。
