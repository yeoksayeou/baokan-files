　　Southwest Grain Administration Directs Subordinate Institutions
    To Prepare for Summer Grain Collection
    Educate Farmers to Love the Country and Hand in Good Grain
    The Southwest Region Grain Administration instructed its subordinate grain institutions on the 23rd of last month to prepare for the entry of public grain into storage this summer. The instructions require grain institutions in various localities to prepare warehouse capacity and necessary storage equipment as early as possible; and to carry out cleaning and repairing of warehouses, as well as pest control in empty warehouses. The instructions stipulate that the quality of grain entering the warehouse should be based on the local medium or above quality standard. The wheat should be qualified with a moisture content of no more than 13% and ash and impurity content below 0.5%. When the grain enters the warehouse, the warehouse staff should strictly check to ensure that the grain entering the warehouse is dry and clean. The time for grain to enter the warehouse should be specifically arranged in various places to avoid congestion and confusion. In addition, the instructions also require local cadres to go to the countryside to publicize the policy of summer grain collection and to conduct patriotic education for farmers to hand in good grain.
