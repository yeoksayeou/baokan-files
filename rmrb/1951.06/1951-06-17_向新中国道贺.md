　　Congratulations to New China
    by Mansinh Rahi, India, translated by Xin He

    People liberated from oppression, breaking all shackles,
    New China of hero Mao Zedong, today we congratulate you.
　
    The East emits a red glow, the people's brows unfold,
    The sound of revolution blows, and a heroic commander appears.
    The slogans shake the sky, and the earth trembles in waves,
    The fascist camp is in chaos, and Truman's backers are panicked.
    Discarding tanks and artillery, the Kuomintang bandit chiefs flee.
    New China of hero Mao Zedong, today we congratulate you.
　
    Chiang Kai-shek's ruling gamble went on day and night yesterday,
    Prisons were filled with workers, peasants, and students.
    The oil press of tyrannical oppression ravaged wantonly,
    They had ropes around their necks, enduring endless torture.
    Right here before our eyes, the people's own regime was established.
    New China of hero Mao Zedong, today we congratulate you.
　
    Over there in Taiwan, the enemy of the people stays, crying,
    The United States is still pumping air into Chiang Kai-shek's corpse.
    But China is happy, happy are the people of China.
    Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, such a group of happy Chinese leaders,
    The violence of the vultures rampant in the world has suffered a devastating blow.
    New China of hero Mao Zedong, today we congratulate you.
　
    Ah, great revolutionary leader, ah, life of all Asia,
    Today your victory banner stirs the hearts of the suffering.
    Blood boils in the veins, and the starving masses soar like raging fire.
    Their own banner is raised, workers and peasants advance, advance.
    Asian history is turning over, this is an unprecedented change.
    New China of hero Mao Zedong, today we congratulate you.

　　向新中国道贺
    印度  曼辛赫·拉希 作  辛禾译
    从压榨下解放了的人民，打断了一切枷锁
    英雄毛泽东的新中国，今天我们向你道贺
　
    东方放出红光，人民的眉头展开
    革命的号声吹起来，出现了英雄统帅
    口号声震动了天空，大地也阵阵摇摆
    法西斯阵营混乱，恐慌了杜鲁门的后台
    丢下了坦克大炮，国民党匪首逃跑
    英雄毛泽东的新中国，今天我们向你道贺
　
    蒋介石的统治赌局昨天还昼夜进行
    监狱里塞满了工人，农民和学生
    暴虐压迫的榨油机肆无忌惮地蹂躏
    他们脖子上套着绳索，忍受着无穷的苦刑
    就在这地方眼前建立了人民自己的政权
    英雄毛泽东的新中国，今天我们向你道贺
　
    那边在台湾呆着哭泣着人民的仇敌
    蒋介石的死尸中美国还在吹进空气
    可是中国是幸福了，幸福的是中国的人民
    周恩来，朱德，像这样幸福的中国领袖之群
    横行世界的鹰鹫的暴力遭遇了毁灭打击
    英雄毛泽东的新中国，今天我们向你道贺
　
    啊伟大的革命领袖，啊全亚洲的生命
    今天你的胜利旗帜激动了受苦人的心情
    血液在血管中沸腾了，挨饿的人群如烈火飞腾
    自己的大旗树起来，工农们前进前进
    亚洲的历史正在翻身，这是空前的变更
    英雄毛泽东的新中国，今天我们向你道贺
