　　Unite, All Brotherly Nationalities of the Country!
    Hunan Yongshun Han and Miao People Are as Close as Brothers. Rename "Miao River, Ke River" as Brother River.
    To the Editor:
    In Yongshun County, western Hunan, there is a Baishui River. This river splits into two branches at Huayuan Town: one is a large stream with a sandy bottom, and the other is a small stream with many rocky reefs. In the past, under the reactionary rule, Great Han chauvinists called the large stream "Ke River" (meaning Han River) and the small stream "Miao River."
    Now, the names of these two rivers have been changed. At a forum of representatives of various nationalities held in Yongshun Huayuan Town, representatives of the local Miao people expressed what had been in their hearts for a long time. They said, "In the past, calling the large river 'Ke River' and the small river 'Miao River' was an insult and discrimination against the Miao people. Today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, no one should look down on anyone else anymore. We propose to change the name of the Miao River!" The Miao representatives also put forward their own opinions, saying, "These two rivers should be renamed Brother River. Because today the Miao and Han people have become brothers!"
    Now, if you go to the Brother River in Huayuan Town, you will often see Miao compatriots happily explaining the renaming of the Miao River to Brother River to passersby. They tell everyone, "It is not allowed to call this river Miao River anymore. After the People's Government issued the instructions, we erected a wooden sign at the bridgehead, writing the name Brother River."

            Xinjiang Bachu Local Tyrant Controlled the Water Canal, Now Returned to the Hands of Farmers
    To the Editor:
    The farmers of all ethnic groups living on the edge of the Tarim Desert in Xinjiang, in Bachu County, love water as much as they love their own eyes. The county has a large canal, which is like the throat of tens of thousands of people in the county. However, this canal was controlled by the big local tyrant Mamuti Aji in the past. In the middle of the canal, there was a Haizi (reservoir) with very weak dikes. During the rainy season, Mamuti Aji allowed the Haizi dikes to be destroyed, and the flood rushed downstream, leaving the downstream farmers homeless. In times of drought, Mamuti Aji would rather let the water leak into the Gobi Desert than let the downstream farmers use it. In this way, seven or eight hundred acres of farmland downstream would die of drought every year, and those that did not die of drought would produce less grain. Xinjiang was liberated, and Chairman Mao's soldiers arrived in Bachu, using thousands of workers to strengthen the sea dike. Mamuti Aji's special privilege to control the water was also crushed, and local farmers took control of the management. Farmers have water to irrigate the land at any time. Last year, not a single seedling died of drought in the county, and we had an unprecedented harvest. General fields yielded half as much grain as in previous years.
    Whenever they use water, the farmers of all ethnic groups in Bachu County talk about the origin of the water, and people always happily say, "This water was brought to us by our beloved Chairman Mao."

            Guangxi Yao Compatriots Go to Wuzhou to Trade, Receiving Warm Hospitality from the People's Government
    To the Editor:
    There used to be many bandits in the Yao Mountains of Wuzhou Prefecture, Guangxi, but they have now been wiped out. In order to help the Yao compatriots improve their lives, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government Working Team organized Yao compatriots from various southeastern townships of the Yao Mountains to collect local specialties such as winter mushrooms and transport them to Wuzhou for sale. On March 11, seven Yao compatriots, carrying more than 800 kilograms of local products such as winter mushrooms, set off from the Yao Mountains to Wuzhou. This was the first time that the Yao compatriots had traveled far to the city for trade. The tax bureau gave all the Yao compatriots' products tax-free preferential treatment. When the Yao compatriots passed through the seventh district of Pingnan and the sixth district of Guiping, they received a warm reception from the district people's governments. When the Yao compatriots took the boat, the boatman was also very happy to see that the Yao compatriots were traveling far for trade, and gave the boat tickets a 50% discount.
    The Yao compatriots arrived in Wuzhou on the 15th. The Wuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Wuzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the Municipal People's Government sent people to welcome them. The next day, the Commissioner's Office also bought sweets, tea, and refreshments to entertain them, and talked cordially with the Yao compatriots. Yao compatriot Pan Zhenhe said, "The Communist Party and the People's Government give us 'sweets', while the reactionaries give us 'iron'." Comrade Chen Jinding, Secretary of the Wuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also gave the Yao compatriots portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, as well as more than 200 books on the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Resistance to America and Aid Korea, and other topics. The Yao compatriots were very happy to see the portrait of Chairman Mao. In order to express their gratitude and love for the Communist Party, they sewed a flag embroidered with words such as "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we truly obtain freedom and equality" and presented it to the Wuzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    After the Yao compatriots sold their local products to the local products company, they bought new clothes and various daily necessities. Zhao Xianrong and Zhao Zhengwen said, "I have never gotten such new clothes before. If Chairman Mao hadn't led us to wipe out the bandits, where would we be today? In the future, we must cooperate with people of all ethnic groups and work hard in production and construction, so that we can live up to the People's Government and Chairman Mao." They also wrote letters to express their gratitude to all walks of life when they left Wuzhou.
    On March 24, they returned to the Yao Mountains. Yao compatriot Pan Zhenhe reported the government's hospitality at the village meeting and shared the sweets sent by the Commissioner's Office with everyone. All the Yao compatriots in the village were very happy.

        Han and Hui People in Maolin District, Ningding, Gansu, Jointly Suppress Bandits and Help Each Other in Production
    To the Editor:
    The third township of Maolin District, Xichuan, thirty miles from Ningding County, Gansu, is a township where Han and Hui people live together. Here, the Han and Hui people live as intimately as a family.
    In the spring of 1950, the local People's Government called on some Han farmers who had fled to move to a village inhabited by Hui people nearby to produce. At first, the Han people had some concerns and did not dare to go to the village to produce. When the Hui people learned of this, they immediately discussed how to break this concern. Hui people Ma Ruhai and Zhao Fuhai took the initiative to send cars to pick up the Han people, to show the sincerity of the Han and Hui people's unity. This proposal was supported by all the Hui people in the village. The Hui people went to the place where the Han people lived, and the Han people warmly entertained them with melon seeds, sweets, snacks, and tea. In this way, they unofficially held a unity meeting, greeted each other, and mutually guaranteed to be united forever, and to fight the bandits together if they came. Then everyone loaded their belongings onto the car and happily welcomed the Han people to their village all the way.
    In order to no longer be robbed by bandits, the Hui and Han masses organized their own militia and built two blockhouses in Lijia Temple, where bandits often harassed them, and patrolled at night. They often drove away bandits who attempted to rob the Hui and Han people. One night, when the militia of Xiadalu Village, a Han village, was firing at bandits, the Hui militia of Zengjia Village rushed to help, and quickly drove the bandits away. When bandits robbed the home of Zhang Farong, a Han resident of Shapo Village, they were also jointly driven away by the Hui and Han militia.
    The Hui people of the third township not only worked with the Han people to stand guard and defend against bandits, but also actively helped the Han people solve the difficulties of lacking cattle and seeds for production. For example, Hui resident Ma Yingxiang had two cows, and he lent one to Han resident Kang Eryue. Other Hui residents also lent seeds and cattle to the Han residents in the same way, solving the difficulties of the Han residents in spring plowing. During this year's spring plowing, the Hui and Han people helped each other and lent each other cattle and seeds. Hui resident Maha had no cattle, and Han resident Li Tingyan lent him one.
    In the past, when the Hui or Han people married a daughter-in-law, they did not ask each other; but now it is different. When Hui resident Bao Fuhai of Lijia Temple married a daughter-in-law, more than 20 Han people from Xiadalu, Lijia Temple, and Qingjiawan went to congratulate him and give gifts. When the son of Qin Kejian, a Han resident of Qingjiawan, married a daughter-in-law, many Hui people also came to congratulate him and give gifts.

　　全国各兄弟民族团结起来！
    湖南永绥汉苗人民亲如兄弟  把“苗河、客河”改名为兄弟河编辑同志：
    在湖南西部永绥县境有一条白水。这条河流到花垣镇分成两支：一条是砂底的巨流，一条是多石礁的细流。在过去反动统治时期，大汉族主义者把大水叫客河（即汉河之意），小水叫苗河。
    现在，这两条河的名字已经改换了。在永绥花垣镇召开的一次各民族代表座谈会上，当地苗族人民的代表提出了从前压在心里的话。他们说：“过去把大河叫客河，小河叫苗河，是侮辱和歧视苗族人民的意思。今天在毛主席的领导下，谁也不应再轻视谁了，我们主张把苗河的名字改掉！”苗族代表并提出了自己的意见说：“这两条河应改名叫兄弟河。因为今天苗汉两族人民已经成了一堂兄弟！”
    现在你只要走到花垣镇的兄弟河边，你就经常会看到苗族同胞们在那里愉快地向过往的人讲解苗河改成兄弟河的事情。他们告诉大家说：“不准把这条河再叫苗河了。人民政府下了指示之后，我们就立个木牌子在桥头，写上兄弟河的名字。”

            新疆巴楚恶霸把持的水渠  如今已回到农民手中编辑同志：
    居住在新疆塔里木大沙漠边沿——巴楚县的各族农民，爱水就像爱自己的眼珠一样。全县有一条大水渠，就像是全县几万人的咽喉；但是这条水渠过去一直被大恶霸马木提阿吉把持着。大渠中间，有个海子（蓄水池），堤防很不牢固，大雨季节，马木提阿吉任凭海子堤闸毁坏，大水直冲下流，使下游的农民无处安身。天旱时，马木提阿吉情愿把水放到戈壁滩上漏掉，也不愿让下游的农民使水。就这样，下游每年都要旱死七、八百亩田禾，旱不死的也少打粮食。新疆解放了，毛主席的战士到了巴楚，用几千个工把海堤修了个结实。马木提阿吉管水的特权也给打垮了，当地农民掌握了管理大权。农民们随时有水浇地。去年全县没旱死一苗田禾，得到从未有过的丰收，一般的田地都比往年多收一半粮食。
    巴楚县的各族农民每当用水的时候就谈论着这水的来历，人们总欢喜地说：“这水是亲爱的毛主席给我们带来的。”

            广西徭胞到梧州作买卖  受到人民政府的热烈招待编辑同志：
    广西梧州专区的徭山，过去土匪很多，现在已经肃清了。广西省人民政府工作队为了帮助徭胞改善生活，组织了徭山东南各乡的徭胞，将当地出产的冬菰等土产集中起来，运往梧州去卖。三月十一日，七位徭胞携着八百多斤冬菰等土产，由徭山出发，前往梧州，这是徭胞们第一次出远门来到城市进行贸易。徭胞们运出的这批土产，税局一律予以免税优待。徭胞们经过平南七区、桂平第六区时，得到区人民政府的热烈招待。徭胞乘船时，船家见徭胞远道进行贸易，心里也很高兴，船票打了个五折。
    徭胞们于十五日到达梧州，中国共产党梧州市委、梧州专署及市人民政府都派人来欢迎，第二天专署还买了糖果、茶点招待，并亲切地和徭胞谈话。徭胞盘振和说：“共产党、人民政府给我们吃的是‘糖’，反动派给我们吃的是‘铁’”。中国共产党梧州市委书记陈金鼎同志还把毛主席和朱总司令的像片及二百多本有关人民政治协商会议、抗美援朝等的书籍，送给徭胞。徭胞见了毛主席像，都非常高兴。他们为了表示对共产党的感激与爱护，缝了一面绣着“只有在共产党和毛主席领导下，我们才真的得到了自由平等”等字的旗子，送给中国共产党梧州市委会。
    徭胞们将土产卖给土产公司后，便买了新衣服以及各种日用品。赵现荣、赵正文说：“我从来没有得到这样的新衣服。要不是毛主席领导我们剿灭了土匪，哪有今天的世界？以后我们要和各族人民合作，努力生产建设，才对得起人民政府和毛主席。”他们离开梧州时还写信向各界道谢。
    三月二十四日，他们回到徭山、徭胞盘振和在村民大会上报告了政府招待他们的情形，并把专署送的糖分给大家吃。全村徭胞都非常喜欢。

        甘肃宁定茂林区汉回人民  齐心剿土匪，互助搞生产编辑同志：
    甘肃宁定县西川三十里的茂林区第三乡，是汉回两族人民杂居的一个乡，在这里汉回人民和一家人一样亲密地生活着。
    一九五○年春天，当地人民政府曾号召一些逃难来的汉族农民搬到附近一个回族人民住的庄子去生产。起初，汉民有些顾虑，不敢上庄生产。回民知道了，马上商量着如何来打破这个顾虑。回民马如海和赵福海等发起派车接汉民，以表示汉回民团结的诚心，这个意见得到该村全体回民的拥护。回民们到了汉民们住的地方，汉民就拿瓜子、糖、点心和茶水热烈地招待他们，这样无形中也就开了个团结会，互相问候，并且互相保证永远团结到一块，来了土匪一齐打。接着大家把东西装上了车，一路上说说笑笑把汉民欢迎到自己的村里。
    为了再不受土匪的抢劫，回汉群众自己组织了民兵，在土匪经常骚扰的李家寺修了两个碉楼，晚间巡夜放哨。他们经常打走企图来抢劫回汉人民的土匪。有一天晚上，汉民村下大路的民兵正和土匪开火时，曾家村的回民民兵，一齐赶来帮助，结果很快就把土匪打跑。又土匪抢劫沙坡村汉民张发荣家时，也被回汉民兵共同打跑。
    三乡的回民，不但和汉民一块放哨防匪，而且积极地帮助汉民解决生产上缺少耕牛和籽种的困难。如回民马英祥有两只牛，就借给汉民康二岳一头，其他回民也一样地借给汉民籽种和耕牛，解决了汉民春耕中的困难。在今年春耕时，回汉人民互相帮助，互相借耕牛借籽种。回民马哈没有耕牛，汉民李廷延就借给他一头。
    在过去，回民或者是汉民娶媳妇时，互相间各不相问；但现在不一样了。李家寺回民包福海娶媳妇时，下大路、李家寺、清家湾的汉民去了二十多人送礼贺喜。清家湾汉民秦克俭儿子娶媳妇时，回民也同样来了很多人恭喜送礼。
