The U.S. Military Tribunal's "Dual Task"
　　On June 13th, the U.S. military tribunal stationed in Japan sentenced two students who had collected signatures for the World Peace Council's declaration on the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact to six months of hard labor.
　　The mission of the U.S. military tribunal stationed in Japan is to release war criminals from prison and imprison peace fighters.

The Maker of "Difficulties"
　　On June 16th, the Iranian authorities arrested two British spies in Luristan. The British spies were traveling in the area inhabited by the Luristan tribal people, inciting them to riot.
　　Wasn't it British Foreign Secretary Morrison who said earlier that he would warn the Iranian government that nationalizing oil would have many difficulties? These British spies are creating "difficulties".

The Voices of London Women
　　A delegation of British women recently visited Parliament and issued a statement saying: "We, the mothers, female teachers, female educators, and women from all walks of life in London, do not want our children to experience the horrors of a new war again, and we will do our best to prevent a third world war."
　　The British Labour government spends large sums of money on war, but only a pittance on education. In 1945, nearly 10,000 children under the age of five in the London area attended kindergarten. Today, there are only 5,200 children in total in London attending kindergarten. This is the evil consequence of the British Labour government's policy of "guns instead of butter."

    美国军事法庭的“双重任务”
    六月十三日，驻日本美国军事法庭将曾经征集世界和平理事会关于缔结五大国和平公约宣言签名的两个学生，判处六个月的苦役。
    驻日美国军事法庭的任务是把监狱的战争罪犯放出来，把和平斗士关进去。
  “困难”的制造者
    伊朗当局于六月十六日在卢里斯坦逮捕了两个英国间谍。英国间谍正在卢里斯坦部落民族居住的地区旅行，鼓动他们骚动。
    英国外相莫里逊早不是就说过，要向伊朗政府提出警告：把石油收归国有是有许多困难的吗？这些英国间谍就是在制造“困难”。
  伦敦妇女的呼声
    英国妇女代表团最近访问议会，并发表声明说：“我们伦敦的母亲、女教师、女教育工作者以及社会各阶层的妇女，不愿让我们的孩子再经历新战争的恐怖，我们要竭力阻止第三次世界大战。”
    英国工党政府为战争花费大批金钱，而为教育事业却只花费微不足道的金钱。一九四五年伦敦区有将近一万个五岁以下的儿童上幼稚园。今天伦敦总共只有五千二百个儿童上幼稚园。这就是英国工党政府执行“大炮代替牛油”政策的恶果。
