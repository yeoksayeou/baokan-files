To the Editor:

The cotton purchasing tasks for Handan Prefecture from January to May this year have largely fallen through. The purchasing target for these five months was 43 million jin of ginned cotton, but only 16 million jin have been completed. The reasons for this situation are: insufficient patriotic and worker-peasant alliance ideological education for cotton farmers by local leading organs; and certain purchasing units not properly grasping cotton grades (in reality, the cotton price policy). The division of labor and cooperation between units are not coordinated enough. Although these problems have been studied by relevant departments, they have not been fundamentally or thoroughly resolved.

First, the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company is downgrading the cotton purchased on its behalf by various supply and marketing cooperatives. According to feedback from county supply and marketing cooperatives, this phenomenon is widespread. Some county cooperatives (such as Wu'an, Cheng'an, and Yongnian) have expressed unwillingness to handle purchasing on behalf of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company for fear of incurring losses due to downgrading. If this issue is not reasonably resolved, it will inevitably affect the completion of the state's cotton purchasing tasks. Here are some specific examples: Cheng'an County's Third District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the eight village cooperatives under its jurisdiction handed over 44,254.5 jin of ginned cotton (hereinafter the same), and the company downgraded 2,360 jin, resulting in a total loss of 15,221,350 yuan; Quzhou County's Henan Tan Cooperative and Longtang Cooperative lost over 11 million yuan due to downgrading; Feixiang County Cooperative reported that last year, the county's cooperatives rarely had cotton downgraded when purchasing on behalf of the company, but this year, downgrading is widespread. For example, the county recently delivered 2,151 jin of D-4 grade ginned cotton, all of which was downgraded to D-5 grade ginned cotton. Thirty-six bales of Star-3 grade ginned cotton had thirty-two bales downgraded to Chen-5 grade, and four bales downgraded to Chen-6 grade. However, after the supply and marketing cooperative compared this batch of downgraded cotton with the same grade of cotton purchased by the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company itself, it was not inferior. These problems have not been resolved to this day.

Second, the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company is using prices higher than those of the supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase cotton, which has affected the cooperative's purchasing business and caused fluctuations in market cotton prices. The cotton purchasing team of the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company in Yingjing Village, Wu'an County, increased the purchase price of seed cotton per jin compared to the price of the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative raised objections, but the team did not accept them. For example, the Xizaizi Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the same county had bought six loads of cotton from cooperative members, but on the way, they encountered cotton purchasing personnel from the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, who upgraded and increased the price – the original fourth-grade cotton was raised to third-grade cotton, and the lint percentage (i.e., the ratio of ginned cotton to seed cotton) was less than 37%, but they purchased it at the 37% price.

Third, there are too many purchasing channels, leading to competition for purchases. At the beginning of this month, there were four cotton purchasing organizations in various cotton markets in Jize County: the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company purchasing team, the supply and marketing cooperative, the exchange, and private merchants. However, all this cotton eventually converges at the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company. Because there are too many purchasing channels, one company purchases cotton, and the others have to wait. The exchange once intentionally raised prices to attract cotton sellers to the exchange, making it impossible for everyone to complete their purchasing tasks. Guangping County has a very small cotton output, but the Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company has set up a cotton purchasing team of more than ten people in the county, and has only received a few thousand jin of cotton so far, while the local cooperative's cotton purchasing personnel have nothing to do. This waste of manpower should be corrected.

Fourth, there is a problem with cotton prices at the border between Pingyuan and Hebei. Recently, the price of medium-grade seed cotton per hundred jin in Shaojiatun, Anyang (at the border between Pingyuan Province and Hebei Province), is 10,000 yuan higher than that in Cixian County. The lint percentage in Cixian County is 33.3%, while in Shaojiatun it is 35%, meaning that Shaojiatun can get an extra one jin and twelve taels of ginned cotton per hundred jin of seed cotton, which is worth about 15,000 yuan at market prices. This has stimulated local peddlers to transport and sell large quantities of cotton from Handan Prefecture. Recently, it has been discovered that peddlers are adulterating cotton with water during transportation in order to obtain higher profits. We hope that relevant departments, in addition to using their main efforts to conduct patriotic education for cotton farmers in cotton purchasing work, should also seriously pay attention to these issues.

### 对邯郸专区购棉工作的几点意见

    对邯郸专区购棉工作的几点意见编辑同志：
    邯郸专区今年一月至五月以来的收棉任务大部落了空，五个月的收购任务为皮棉四千三百万斤，仅仅完成了一千六百万斤。造成这种情况的原因是：当地领导机关对棉农的爱国主义和工农联盟的思想教育不够；某些收购单位对棉花等级（实际上即棉价政策）掌握得不好。各单位间分工合作不够协调，这些问题虽已经有关部门研究过，但基本上没有解决，或未彻底解决。
    第一，花纱布公司降级收购各供销社代购的棉花。这种现象，根据各县供销社反映，是普遍存在的。某些县社（如武安、成安、永年）因恐代购棉花再被降级而致本身赔累，曾提出不愿为花纱布公司办理代购业务。这个问题如不求得合理解决，必然会影响到国家收棉任务的完成。下面是些具体的事例：成安县三区供销社和该区所辖八个村社，交到花纱布公司四万四千二百五十四斤半皮棉（下同），被公司降级二千三百六十斤，共赔款一千五百二十二万一千三百五十元；曲周县河南滩社和龙堂社代购棉花，因被降级赔款达一千一百多万元；肥乡县社反映：去年该县合作社代购棉花很少降级，而今年则普遍降级，如最近该县交出的丁四级皮棉二千一百五十一斤，全部降级为丁五级皮棉。星三级皮棉三十六包，有三十二包降为辰五级，四包降为辰六级。但经供销社将这批降级棉花与花纱布公司自己收购的同级棉花比较，并不逊色。这些问题至今还没有解决。
    第二，花纱布公司用高于供销社的价格收棉，影响了合作社的代购业务，并引起了市场棉价的波动。武安县营井村花纱布公司的收棉小组，将每斤籽棉收价比供销社的收价提高，供销社曾提出意见，但该组并不接受。又如该县西寨子村供销社买妥了社员的六驮棉花，在路上遇到花纱布公司收棉人员，被他们抬级提价——原为四级棉提为三级棉，衣分率（即皮棉籽棉比率）不足百分之三十七，按百分之三十七价格，争购而去。
    第三，收购头绪太多，造成争购现象。鸡泽县本月初旬各地棉市存在四个收棉机构，即花纱布公司收购小组、供销社、交易所和私商。而这些棉花最后都汇交花纱布公司。由于收购头绪过多，一家收棉，他家就得坐等。交易所曾因为收不到棉花，有意提价收购，把售棉户吸引到交易所去，使大家都无法完成收购任务。广平县棉花产量很少，而花纱布公司却在该县设立十余人的收棉小组，至今才收到几千斤棉花，而当地合作社收棉人员只好闲着无事可做了。这种浪费人力的情况，应当纠正。
    第四，平原、河北交界处的棉价有问题。最近安阳邵家屯（平原省与河北省交界处）中等籽棉每百斤价较磁县高出一万元，磁县收购衣分率为百分之三十三点三，邵家屯则为百分之三十五，即每百斤籽棉邵家屯可多出一斤十二两皮棉的价钱，合市价约一万五千元。由此刺激了当地小贩将邯郸专区棉花大量外运销售，最近曾发现小贩在外运棉花中掺杂掺水，以图获得更高的利润。我们希望有关部门在收棉工作中，除了用主要力量对棉农进行爱国主义教育外，并应严重地注意这些问题。
