Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

To the Editor:

We fully accept the criticism made by comrades Wang Wenhan and two others in the People's Daily on May 22nd in the Readers' Letters column regarding the destruction of mountain forests in our county.

The reason for the incidents of mountain forest destruction in our county is mainly due to the insufficient understanding of the importance of forest protection by the leading cadres of our county. Jingxian has more mountains and less arable land, and the protection of mountain forests is of great importance to the people's livelihood, which we also did not sufficiently recognize. Therefore, our efforts to mobilize and organize the masses to do a good job in forest protection have been insufficient. Although we have done some forest protection work this year, such as issuing two forest protection notices, holding two representative meetings for the purchase of timber and the protection of mountain forests, punishing two timber companies that engaged in illegal logging and felling, sentencing five arsonists to imprisonment, and establishing preliminary forest protection organizations at all levels, etc. However, our work has not been thorough enough, and the destruction of mountain forests has not been completely stopped. Therefore, we have decided to continue to take the following measures on the existing basis to further strengthen forest protection work:

(1) Continue to conduct forest protection education among county and district cadres, improve the county and district forest protection organizations and working systems, and at the same time, set up professional county-level forestry cadres to regularly go to the countryside to inspect the forest protection situation.

(2) Further mobilize the masses to universally organize forest protection groups, formulate forest protection covenants, and gradually eliminate the bad habits of indiscriminate burning of mountains and indiscriminate felling left over from the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

(3) Strengthen the management of timber procurement and strictly deal with illegal elements who indiscriminately cut and fell trees.

(4) Focus on organizing the masses to do a good job in closing mountains for afforestation, and solve the mountain forest disputes among the masses in conjunction with the clearing of land reform legacy issues.

Jingxian People's Government, Southern Anhui

### 皖南泾县人民政府进一步加强护林工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

　　皖南泾县人民政府进一步加强护林工作编辑同志：
    人民日报五月二十二日读者来信栏内刊登王文汉等三同志对我县山林破坏的现象所提出的批评，我们完全接受。
    我县发生破坏山林事件的原因，主要是我县领导干部对保护山林的重要性认识不足。泾县山多田少，保护山林对于人民生活有重大关系，这点我们也认识不足。因此发动组织群众作好护林工作做得不够。今年以来我们虽然做过了一些护林工作，如：出过两次护林布告，开过两次采购林木和保护山林的代表会，处罚了两家劫采滥伐的木材公司，对五个烧山犯判处了徒刑，并初步建立了各级护林组织等等。但是我们的工作还不够深入，山林的破坏仍未完全停止。因此，我们决定在现有的基础下继续采取下列措施以进一步加强护林工作：
    （一）继续在县区干部中进行护林教育，健全县区护林组织及工作制度，同时设置县级林业工作专业干部，经常下乡检查护林情况。
    （二）进一步发动群众普遍组织护林小组，订立护林公约，逐步肃清国民党反动统治时期所遗留下来的滥肆烧山、乱行砍伐的恶劣习惯。
    （三）加强木材采购的管理，对滥砍乱伐的不法分子给以严格处理。
    （四）有重点地组织群众作好封山育林工作，结合清理土地改革遗留问题，解决群众中的山林纠纷问题。
                                          皖南泾县人民政府
