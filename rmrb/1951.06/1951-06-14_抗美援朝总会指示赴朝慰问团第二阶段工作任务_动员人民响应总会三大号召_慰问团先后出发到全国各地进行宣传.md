Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Liao Chengzhi, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, and Deputy Heads Chen Yi and Tian Han, on the day before the delegation departed to conduct propaganda in various parts of the country (June 12th), submitted a summary report on the delegation's work in Korea to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters, and Vice Chairmen Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, and requested instructions regarding the delegation's plan to go to various parts of the country to conduct propaganda. After listening to the delegation's report on the first phase of work, Chairman Guo Moruo and Vice Chairmen Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters pointed out: The delegation has carried out the tasks entrusted by the people of the whole country, conveyed the determination of the people of the whole country to resist America and aid Korea, encouraged the fighting will of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and strengthened the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. The Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters expresses satisfaction with the delegation's first phase of work. At the same time, it is reported that the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, especially the Chinese People's Volunteers, also express extreme satisfaction with the delegation's work and the care of the people of the motherland. The broad masses of people in Beijing who have listened to the reports of the delegation representatives have already taken practical actions to respond to the three major calls of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters. The upsurge of enthusiastic response to the three major calls of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters launched by the people of the capital will be the prelude to a widespread, in-depth, and sustained response to the Headquarters' calls by the people of the whole country.

Chairman Guo Moruo and Vice Chairmen Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, on behalf of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters, approved the delegation's plan to depart for every city, county, several industrial and mining areas, and vast rural areas across the country to conduct propaganda work, and gave important instructions, pointing out that the central task of the second phase of the delegation is to conduct universal and in-depth patriotic education among the people of the whole country once again, promote the patriotic enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, mobilize the people of the whole country to actively respond to the three major calls of the Headquarters, and strive for the early victory of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea War. Regarding the three major calls, the people of the whole country should be informed that: the patriotic pact is a new and valuable creation of the Chinese people, a common and concrete action program for people of all classes and sectors in the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement, and will play a great role in promoting the early victory of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea War and the success of national construction; when promoting the donation of aircraft and artillery movement, not only should the military significance of promoting early victory be explained, but also through this movement, the political consciousness and sense of responsibility of the people of the whole country towards the motherland should be further enhanced politically, and production should be further actively promoted economically; at the same time, the people of the whole country must be called upon to fully value and do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers.

The three chairmen of the Headquarters also instructed that when the delegation goes to various regions of the country to carry out its work, it should first pay attention to combining the three major calls of the Headquarters with the work tasks of various regions, classes, and sectors, and mobilize the broad masses of the people to consciously and voluntarily respond to the three major calls of the Headquarters, and strengthen the Anti-American and Aid-Korea movement according to their own specific conditions. Secondly, after the delegation's sub-teams return to their respective regions, in addition to maintaining necessary contact with the General Headquarters (located in Beijing), their daily work must respect the guidance of the local People's Consultative Conference and the Military and Political Committee, and be under the direct leadership of the local Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Branches and Branches. In order to strengthen the delegation's propaganda work to the people of the whole country, the Headquarters will instruct the Anti-American and Aid-Korea branches in various places to dispatch appropriate cadres to assist the delegation in carrying out its work and provide the delegation with all possible conveniences.

The three chairmen of the Headquarters finally stated: The delegation will play a great role in promoting the three major calls of the Headquarters in various parts of the country.

Xinhua News Agency, June 13th: Since returning to Beijing on May 29th, the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has summarized and reported its first phase of work to the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters. It has also made 170 reports, conveying the glorious deeds of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies in their heroic battles to 500,000 people in the capital, and promoted the movement of the people of the capital to respond to the three calls of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters. Having successfully completed the above tasks, the delegation is scheduled to depart for various parts of the country in the next two days to conduct propaganda among the people of the whole country for a period of two to three months.

The sub-teams composed of representatives from the five major administrative regions of Northwest, Southwest, East China, Central South, and North China will return to their original regions and conduct propaganda in every city and county. As the Northwest and Southwest regions have fewer representatives and are insufficient for distribution, members of the Beijing directly-affiliated sub-team will participate in and assist in the work.

On the 13th, the first sub-team (including a part of the original directly-affiliated sub-team), led by Liao Chengzhi, Head of the General Delegation, and Tian Han, Deputy Head, departed for Tianjin. After concentrating on propaganda in Tianjin for several days, it will return to the Northwest region; the second (including another part of the original directly-affiliated sub-team) and third sub-teams, led by Chen Yi, Deputy Head of the General Delegation, departed for Shanghai. After concentrating on propaganda in Shanghai for several days, the third sub-team will depart for various parts of East China, and the second sub-team will return to the Southwest region; the remaining sub-teams will return directly to their original locations from Beijing.

The original 73 members of the China Acrobatic Troupe of the General Delegation (including 13 members of the Central Conservatory of Music), led by Wang Dizi, Zhang Lu, and Lan Ma, will conduct propaganda in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places, and will hold special charity performances to raise funds for the purchase of aircraft and artillery.

More than 280 members of the Ballad and Theatrical Arts Team (including more than 150 newly mobilized from Beijing and Tianjin) will travel with the sub-teams to various places to conduct propaganda performances in five groups.

In order to further expand the needs of Anti-American and Aid-Korea patriotic propaganda, the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters has decided to organize 50 writers and artists from inside and outside the delegation to concentrate on creating various literary and artistic works.

On the eve of the delegation's departure, the Beijing Consultative Committee, the People's Government, various democratic parties, the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Branch, and various people's organizations jointly held a reception. Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Headquarters, spoke at the meeting and gave detailed instructions on the delegation's future work. Liao Chengzhi, Head of the Delegation, in his reply, stated on behalf of all members that they would resolutely implement the instructions of the Headquarters and overcome all difficulties to complete the task.

    慰问团由西北、西南、华东、中南和华北五大行政区代表所组成的各分团，仍返回原地区每一市、县进行宣传。西北和西南地区因代表少不敷分配，由北京直属分团团员分别参加帮助工作。

    曲艺大队二百八十余人（包括新自京、津两地动员的一百五十余人），分五路随各分团赴各地进行宣传表演。
    为进一步扩大抗美援朝爱国宣传的需要，抗美援朝总会已决定，将组织慰问团团内外作家及文艺工作者五十人，集中创作各种文艺作品。
    慰问团出发前夕，北京市协商委员会、人民政府、各民主党派、抗美援朝分会及各人民团体联合举行了招待晚会。中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席彭真在会上讲话，对慰问团今后的工作作了详尽指示。慰问团廖承志团长在致答辞中，代表全体团员表示将坚决执行总会的指示，克服一切困难完成任务。
