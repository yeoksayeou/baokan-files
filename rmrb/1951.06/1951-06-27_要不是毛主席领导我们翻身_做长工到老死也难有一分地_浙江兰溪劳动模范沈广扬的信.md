　　If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to liberation, I would have been a long-term laborer until I died and never had a piece of land
   ——A letter from Shen Guangyang, a labor model in Lanxi, Zhejiang

Dearest Chairman Mao:

Since I was eight years old, for decades, I helped others herd cattle and worked as a long-term laborer. After the land reform, I was allocated eight mu of land and farm tools. Last year, I built three thatched huts. Because I am good at production, I was selected as a labor model in the autumn, and the Commissioner's Office also gave me farm tools and fertilizer. This spring, I went to Hangzhou to participate in the Provincial Labor Model Conference, and Chairman Tan Zhenlin also gave me foreign cloth, towels, and bone meal.

If it weren't for you leading us to liberation, I would have worked as a long-term laborer until I was old and died, and I still wouldn't have had a piece of land or a room!

I truly thank the Chinese Communist Party for its thirty years of bloodshed and sweat for the people of the whole country. Millions upon millions of peasants are living happy lives under your sun-like warm radiance, and are showing great strength on the production lines.

The people in our village will commemorate "July 1st" with practical actions to increase production. Now, we have completed our plan to challenge the 47 mutual aid groups in Xingping County, Shaanxi in the summer harvest and summer planting work, and are universally participating in the movement to donate airplanes and cannons on the basis of increased production.

Wishing you good health!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Shen Guangyang, Cooperation Village, Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province

### 要不是毛主席领导我们翻身  做长工到老死也难有一分地——浙江兰溪劳动模范沈广扬的信

　　要不是毛主席领导我们翻身  做长工到老死也难有一分地
   ——浙江兰溪劳动模范沈广扬的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我从八岁起，几十年来，帮人放牛，做长工。土地改革后分到八亩田和农具。去年搭起茅蓬三间。因为我生产搞得好，秋天被选为劳动模范，专员公署还给了我农具和肥料。今春到杭州参加省劳动模范大会，谭震林主席还送给我洋布、毛巾和骨粉。
    要不是您领导我们翻身，我作长工作到老、作到死，也还不会有一分地，一间屋呀！
    我真感谢中国共产党三十年来为全国人民流血流汗的功劳。千千万万的农民，在你像太阳一样的温暖光辉下，过着幸福的日子；在生产线上，显示出巨大的力量。
    我们村里的人，将以增产的实际行动来纪念“七一”。现在，我们已经完成了在夏收夏选工作中向陕西兴平县四十七个互助组应战的计划，在增产的基础上，普遍地参加捐献飞机大炮的运动。祝你健康！
          浙江省兰谿县合作村  沈广扬
