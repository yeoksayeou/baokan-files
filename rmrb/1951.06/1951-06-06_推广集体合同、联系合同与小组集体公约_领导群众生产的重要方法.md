Promoting Collective Contracts, Liaison Contracts, and Group Collective Pacts
--Important Methods for Leading Mass Production

One of the more common problems in the current production of industrial and mining enterprises is the unclear division of labor and responsibilities between the administration and the trade union in leading production. There is also a lack of coordination and balance between management departments and production departments, and even between advanced and backward elements within production groups. This affects the overall balance of production and hinders the establishment of average advanced quotas. How can this problem be solved? The collective contract, liaison contract, and group collective pact methods adopted by a certain factory and a certain steel plant have effectively solved this problem. The collective contract organizes the factory administration and all employees to manage the factory and improve production, and on this basis, to improve the lives and welfare of employees in a planned way. The collective contract is a contract signed between all employees of the factory and the administration, stipulating the responsibilities and guarantees of both the factory and the employees. The liaison contract organizes all personnel in groups, workshops, production departments, and management departments to cooperate with each other to improve production. It stipulates the responsibilities and guarantees of both groups, workshops, and production and management departments. The group collective pact organizes the personnel within a group (including machines, personnel, and technology) to fully improve the group's production. It enables the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to help the backward. This is the transition from individual competition to collective (group-based) competition. The organic connection and close cooperation of the three aspects organize the strength of all employees in the factory from all aspects, and strive to complete and exceed the factory's production tasks. This is an important experience worth promoting.

What are the main experiences of implementing collective contracts, liaison contracts, and group collective pacts in public enterprises? First, because the contract system and the pact system specifically stipulate the responsibilities that each party should bear in ensuring the completion of the state's production plan, the division of labor and responsibilities between the administration and the trade union, between production departments and management departments, between production departments, and between leaders and those being led are clarified. Therefore, the self-esteem and consciousness of both parties are improved, which greatly enhances the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of the administration and the trade union, staff, workers, and technicians. Second, in order to fulfill the contract and ensure the completion of the production tasks, on the one hand, it will prompt trade union cadres to further improve their work style, go deep into the workshops to study production; and be able to better mobilize employees to discuss the state's production plan, mobilize the masses to improve technology, improve technology, and overcome obstacles in production, and solve key problems. This series of work processes is the process of unity between technicians and workers, that is, the combination of technology and labor. On the other hand, it will also prompt the administrative management department to strengthen and improve administrative leadership, ensure the timely supply of raw materials and tools, and the realization of reasonable labor protection and welfare facilities; strengthen technical leadership, and establish and improve technical operating procedures to reduce accidents. This not only clarifies the production concepts of administrative and trade union management personnel and all employees, but also organizes all the forces in the factory (including leadership and management) to complete and exceed the state's production plan in different work positions. This transforms and improves the leadership methods of the administration and the trade union, and establishes the viewpoint of relying on the working masses. Third, the content of the contract and pact in socialist enterprises not only holds both parties responsible for production, but also includes the material and cultural welfare facilities that the enterprise administration should provide to all employees on the basis of completing and exceeding the production plan. This clarifies the ideological understanding of the consistency between the administration, the trade union, and all employees in improving production and improving the lives of employees, that is, closely combining the interests of the new democratic society with the individual interests of employees. Fourth, since the contract and pact are signed based on the specific situation and key issues of the factory in a certain period, the contract and pact themselves point out the goals of struggle for employees in a certain period, so that the trade union can lead labor competition with a basis. Therefore, it can make labor competition become regular and lasting. Therefore, it is a very good working method and also a very important working experience. However, this experience has not been valued by the leading cadres of all industrial and mining enterprises. Many leading cadres, especially the administrative and trade union cadres of factories, are afraid of trouble. Some administrative management cadres emphasize that production is abnormal, quotas are inaccurate, and the supply of raw materials and tools is still problematic. In fact, this is no longer a reason, because at present, every factory and mine in the Northeast has an annual or quarterly production plan, the management of various quotas has made great progress compared with the past, and the supply system of raw materials and tools has also been established. As long as the leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises, especially the administrative and trade union leading cadres, value this experience, we already have the conditions to vigorously promote this experience in industrial and mining enterprises.

Therefore, all industrial and mining enterprises should study and try to formulate plans based on the specific conditions of their enterprises, combined with the current central task of strengthening technical management and improving product quality. The initial trial period should not be too long. A quarterly collective contract can be signed between the administration and the trade union. In the process of implementing the collective contract, liaison contracts between departments and collective pacts within groups should be carried out according to the needs of production and construction, and labor competitions to improve quality and improve technology should be carried out to ensure the implementation of the collective contract, so as to improve the current production and construction work.

Of course, when promoting this experience, the enterprise's leading organs and their cadres must pay attention to the following issues: First, the main contents of the contract should include the completion of the production plan (including output, quality, and cost), the improvement of the lives of employees (including labor protection and other material and cultural collective welfare facilities), reward methods, and other guarantees from both the administration and the trade union. For example, the trade union should guarantee to educate employees to abide by technical operating procedures, and the administration should guarantee the timely supply of raw materials, tools, and labor protection equipment. Second, the signing of the contract and the pact must make the overall state production plan and the specific plan of the factory become the masses' own plan, that is, after the discussion of the management committee, the ideological mobilization inside and outside the party, and the discussion of all employees, the contract and the pact should become the business of every employee. Third, once the contract and the pact are signed, their seriousness should be maintained. The responsibilities, rights, obligations, and reward and punishment methods of both parties in the contract and the pact should be specifically included in their work plans by the administration and the trade union to ensure that they must be earnestly implemented. To this end, the collective contract should be filed with the local government's labor bureau, and the labor bureau should regularly check it. Fourth, the party committee in the industrial and mining enterprises should lead the trade union and the Communist Youth League to give play to the organizational role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and carry out propaganda and mobilization work through various organizational forms such as employee representative meetings, workshop production meetings, and production wage committees, mobilize all employees, and carry out competitions, especially organize administrative management personnel and technical personnel to participate in the movement, so that leadership and the masses, technology and labor are combined. Fifth, carry out criticism and self-criticism. Give play to the inspection and supervision role of the masses to ensure the implementation of the contract and the pact.

Therefore, all industrial and mining enterprises are required to value and use this experience, so as to improve our industrial production, and thereby gradually improve the lives of employees on the basis of improving production.

　　推广集体合同、联系合同与小组集体公约
    ——领导群众生产的重要方法
    目前工矿企业生产中较为普遍存在的问题之一，是行政与工会在领导生产上分工与职责不清，管理部门与生产部门之间，生产部门与生产部门之间尚有不衔接不平衡以及在生产小组之内存在着先进与落后的现象，因之，影响整个生产的平衡和妨碍平均先进定额之制定。如何解决这一问题呢？某厂与某地制钢厂所采用的集体合同、联系合同与小组集体公约的办法很好地解决了这一问题。集体合同是把工厂行政与全体职工组织起来，管好工厂搞好企业的生产，并在这个基础上有计划地改进职工的生活福利；集体合同是全厂职工与行政签订的合同，规定厂方和职工双方所负的责任和保证。联系合同是把组与组、车间与车间、生产部门与管理部门的所有人员组织起来相互配合搞好生产；是规定组与组、车间与车间、生产部门与生产部门之间双方所负的责任和保证。小组集体公约则是把一个小组内的人员（包括机器、人员、技术）组织起来全力搞好小组的生产。就是使落后者赶上先进者，用先进者帮助落后者。这是个人的竞赛走向集体（以小组为单位）的竞赛。三者有机的联系并密切配合，从各方面把工厂全体职工的力量组织起来，为完成与超过全厂的生产任务而努力，这是值得大力推广的重要经验。
    在公营企业内实行集体合同、联系合同、小组集体公约的主要经验是什么呢？第一、由于合同制与公约制具体规定了相互之间在保证完成国家生产计划上应负的职责，这样便明确了行政与工会、生产部门与管理部门、生产部门与生产部门之间，领导人员与被领导人员之间的分工与职责范围。因而，提高了双方的自尊心与自觉性，由此便大大地发挥了行政与工会，职员、工人与技术人员间的主动性、积极性与创造性。第二、双方为履行合同，保证生产任务的完成，一方面将促使工会干部进一步改进工作作风，深入车间钻研生产；并能更好地动员职工讨论国家的生产计划，发动群众改进技术、提高技术以及克服生产中的阻碍，解决关键问题。这一系列的工作过程，是技术人员与工人的团结过程，亦即是技术与劳动相结合的过程。另一方面也将促使行政管理部门亦须加强与改善行政领导，保证原材料、工具的及时供应与合理的劳动保护福利设施的实现；加强技术领导，建立与健全技术操作规程，以减少事故。这样不仅明确了行政、工会管理人员与全体职工的生产观念，而且把工厂内的全部力量（领导管理在内）组织起来，在不同的工作岗位上，去完成与超过国家的生产计划。这样就转变与改善了行政与工会的领导方法，树立依靠工人群众的观点。第三、社会主义性质的企业内的合同与公约，其内容不仅双方对生产负责，而且它亦包括了在完成与超过生产计划的基础上，企业行政对全体职工应作的物质的、文化的福利设施，这样便明确了行政、工会与全体职工搞好生产与改善职工生活一致性的思想认识，亦即把新民主主义社会的利益与职工个人的利益密切结合起来。第四、由于合同与公约是根据工厂一定时期的具体情况与关键问题而签订，合同与公约本身给职工指出了一定时期的奋斗目标，使工会领导劳动竞赛有所依据，这样就能使劳动竞赛变成经常与持久。因之它是很好的工作方法，也是很主要的工作经验。但这一经验并没有被所有工矿企业的领导干部重视，不少领导干部特别是工厂行政与工会的干部怕麻烦，也有些行政管理干部强调生产不正常，定额不准确，原材料工具供应尚有问题。其实这已不成为理由，因为目前来说东北每一厂矿都有了全年的或季度的生产计划，各种定额管理已比过去有很大进步，原材料、工具的供应制度也已建立，只要工矿企业的领导干部特别是行政与工会的领导干部重视这一经验，我们已有条件，可以在工矿企业内大力推广这一经验。
    因此，所有工矿企业应当根据本企业的具体情况，结合目前加强技术管理，提高产品质量的中心工作，研究试订。开始试行时间不宜过长，可以先订立行政与工会双方季度的集体合同，在贯彻集体合同过程中，根据生产与建设的需要，开展各部门之间的联系合同与小组内的集体公约，开展改善质量、提高技术的劳动竞赛，以保证集体合同的贯彻执行，从而把目前生产与建设工作提高一步。
    当然，在推广这一经验时，企业领导机关及其干部必须注意以下的问题：第一、合同的主要内容应当包括完成生产计划（包括产量、质量成本），改善职工生活（包括劳动保护与其他物质的文化的集体福利设施），奖励办法，以及行政与工会双方其他方面的保证事项。如工会应保证教育职工遵守技术操作规程，行政保证原材料、工具与劳动保护用品的及时供应等。第二、合同与公约的签订必须把国家总的生产计划与本厂的具体计划成为群众自己的计划，即经过管理委员会的讨论，党内外的思想动员与全体职工的讨论，使合同与公约成为每个职工自己的事情。第三、合同与公约既经签订，应保持其严肃性，合同与公约中的双方职责、权利、义务与奖惩办法，行政与工会均应具体列入其工作计划内，以一切办法保证必须认真执行。为此，集体合同应向当地政府劳动局备案，劳动局应认真定期检查。第四、工矿企业内党委要领导工会与青年团发挥工会与青年团的组织作用，通过各种组织形式如职工代表会，车间生产会议，生产工资委员会，进行宣传鼓动工作，发动全体职工，开展竞赛，特别是组织行政管理人员与技术人员参加运动，以便领导与群众、技术与劳动都结合。第五、开展批评与自我批评。发挥群众的检查与监督作用，保证合同与公约的贯彻执行。
    因此要求各工矿企业重视与运用这一经验，以便把我们的工业生产提高一步，从而在提高生产的基础上逐步地改善职工生活。
