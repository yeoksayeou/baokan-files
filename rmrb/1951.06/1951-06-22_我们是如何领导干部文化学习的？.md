How Did We Lead Cadre Cultural Learning?
	The Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

	The majority of cadres in Hebei Province are from worker and peasant backgrounds. They have rich work experience, but their cultural level is very low. Most district cadres have an education level below upper primary school, making it difficult for them to read newspapers, documents, and write reports. Some are illiterate, and they cannot even understand statistical figures. Most county-level cadres have a primary school level of arithmetic and an upper primary school level of Chinese language. Cadres at the prefectural and provincial levels generally have a junior high school level of Chinese language, with relatively high reading comprehension but low writing skills. In arithmetic, most have the level of upper primary school or the first year of junior high school. We must organize and lead the improvement of cadres' cultural level so that they can better complete their current tasks and lead large-scale national economic construction in the future.

 Cadres Can Learn Culture Well While Working

	In June 1950, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the spirit of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's February Propaganda and Education Conference, specifically stipulated the standards for cadre study grading: cadres whose cultural level (including Chinese language, mathematics, physics, history, geography, etc.) is below junior high school graduation should generally suspend theoretical study and focus on cultural remediation. Illiterate cadres were required to reach the level of primary school graduation within two to three years. Cadres with upper primary or junior high school levels were required to improve by one level. The Provincial Department of Education stipulated the school system (two years for primary school, one year for upper primary school, and three years for junior high school), curriculum, and teaching materials, and also assigned full-time teachers.

	Currently, more than 80,000 cadres, accounting for approximately 90% of the province's cadres, are participating in cultural learning. Cadre after-work cultural supplementary schools have been established in county-level and above agencies. Most county committee members and some prefectural committee members in the province have participated in the learning. The attendance rate of students is generally maintained at around 80% in most areas (excluding cadres working in rural areas), and absenteeism has been eliminated in a few areas. There are currently 1,094 after-work school classes and 565 full-time teachers in the province. Most after-work schools have become regularized, conducting teaching according to the unified school system and curriculum, and have established regulations for attendance, leave, and examinations.

	After half a year of study, the cultural level of cadres has gradually improved. For example, in She County, 63 cadres who previously did not recognize a single character can now read simple documents and write simple letters. In the Cang County Commissioner's Office, 18 people who had never studied arithmetic have now learned integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and some have learned decimals and fractions. It is estimated that by the end of 1952, 40 to 50 classes in provincial-level agencies and directly subordinate cities will reach junior high school graduation level.

	During the learning process, cadres' thinking has also undergone new changes. The most obvious is the correction of the pessimistic emotions and retirement thoughts generated by some cadres due to their low cultural level. In addition, it has broadened the horizons of cadres, enhanced their patriotic ideology, and corrected the superstitious thinking of some cadres from peasant backgrounds.

	At the same time, cultural learning has improved the working ability of cadres. Many cadres have found it extremely convenient in both work and study after acquiring preliminary cultural knowledge.

	The above situation fully demonstrates that cadres can do well in cultural learning while working. Moreover, the improvement of the cultural level of the vast number of workers and peasants should mainly rely on on-the-job learning. The view that only leaving work can make learning effective is incorrect.

 Ensure Necessary Learning Conditions

	To lead cadres' cultural learning while working, it is first necessary to ensure the necessary learning conditions. Cadres must be able to adhere to two hours of study every day. Teachers must be assigned, necessary funds and equipment must be provided, and sound learning systems must be established, such as attendance, leave, examination, and homework. After-work schools must be closely linked with the administrative and Party branches of various agencies to implement the above systems. Party branches should list leading and ensuring the learning of Party members and cadres as a regular and major task. Responsible cadres should set an example and participate in the learning. Because the improvement of the cultural level of responsible cadres is of greater help to the work (such as many members of the prefectural committee who are still at the primary school level). Moreover, after responsible cadres participate in the learning, they can understand the problems in the learning in a timely manner, try to strengthen the leadership, and can also play a leading role. For example, He Bingzhang, Secretary of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee, agreed with other members to attend classes on time every morning and listened attentively. He also served as the principal of the after-work school directly under the prefecture. Wang Zhenhai, Secretary of the Ding County Committee, insisted on various learning systems and paid attention to reviewing and careful research.

 Overcome Ideological Obstacles to Learning Culture

	Mobilizing cadres to learn culture is a process of ideological struggle. Leading cadres should strengthen ideological leadership and correct various incorrect understandings in a timely manner. In the past, during the land reform period, some workers and peasants once had the wrong understanding that "being a crude person is glorious," thinking that as long as there is experience, "one can still be a cadre without culture," and "one can still do the job." Some cadres cannot let go of their airs, thinking that learning culture is lowering their political treatment. Some use the excuse of being busy with work and do not actively learn culture. Others lack confidence in learning culture because they are old and have poor memory.

	In response to the above situation, we have focused on solving the ideological problems of the students. Leading cadres emphasized that in future national construction work, it is not enough to rely solely on old experience, and called on everyone to put down their airs and be primary school students. They also explained that this is precisely the Party's concern and love for workers and peasants. After the start of learning, leading cadres emphasized proceeding from reality, calling on everyone to study hard and consolidate their learning results. Leading cadres set an example, repeatedly mobilized, and then, through the inspection of Party branches and groups, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and gradually solved these ideological problems in general.

	In terms of teacher-student relations, some cadres initially looked down on teachers (mostly newly employed intellectuals), thinking that the teachers' political level was low and they could not teach themselves. There were even cases of cadres deliberately making things difficult for teachers, which affected the work enthusiasm of some teachers. As a result, the teachers felt that the cadres were not easy to "serve" and relaxed their leadership over learning. The solution to this problem is to first promote respect for teachers among cadres; secondly, to help teachers politically, so that they can recognize that improving the cultural level of workers and peasants is an arduous and meaningful work. All political reports and meetings that teachers can participate in are arranged for them to participate in, so as to strengthen the political and theoretical study of teachers and improve them politically. At the same time, it is also necessary to help teachers improve their teaching methods according to the characteristics of cadre learning. Now this problem has been basically solved, and the teacher-student relationship has become harmonious.

 Cadres Working in Rural Areas Can Also Learn

	The learning of cadres in county-level and above agencies is uneven because some cadres are often working in rural areas. Cadres who often work in rural areas often cannot keep up with the lessons, and some even drop a class. This is a relatively complex and difficult problem to solve. According to our experience, the key to solving this problem mainly lies in the cadres' self-awareness, because learning time can still be squeezed out after going to the countryside. At the same time, the leadership must organize and supervise, and provide certain preview opportunities and make-up class time from work. The method of organizing rural learning is: before going to the countryside, the teacher gives a targeted pre-lecture (the amount of lectures must be determined according to the length of time in the countryside), or issues a study outline. After going to the countryside, self-study and mutual assistance are implemented. If there are difficulties, find local teachers to help solve them. Make-up classes are given when returning.

	District cadres are often working in rural areas. Therefore, organizing their learning is the main task of cultural teachers. The method is to closely integrate the learning system with the work system. District cadres hold large gatherings every ten days or half a month, and conduct learning (learning day). When the groups gather to report on their work every five to seven days, teachers take turns teaching in each group and prescribe homework. Usually, primary school teachers help with the learning. The learning of district cadres is directly led by the District Committee of the Communist Party of China. The County Committee holds a cultural teacher meeting every half a month to report and arrange work and exchange experiences.

	The above methods are implemented better and the results are very good in areas where leading cadres attach importance to them and the work system is regular.

　　我们是如何领导干部文化学习的？
        中共河北省委宣传部
    河北省在职干部，绝大部分是工农出身；工作经验丰富，但文化水平却很低。区干部绝大部分是高小以下的水平，他们看报纸、阅读文件、写报告时都感觉困难；有一部分是文盲，他们甚至连统计数字也弄不清楚。县级机关干部，在算术方面大多数是初小程度；在语文方面多数是高小程度。专区和省两级的机关干部，在语文方面大部已达到初中程度，阅读能力比较高，但写作能力低；算术程度则多数是高小与初中一年级的水平。我们必须有组织有领导地提高干部的文化水平，才能使他们更好地完成当前的各项工作任务，并在今后领导大规模的国家经济建设工作。
  在职干部是能把文化学好的
    一九五○年六月，中共河北省委根据中共中央华北局二月宣传教育会议的精神，具体地规定了干部学习编级标准：凡文化程度（包括语文、数理、史地等科）不够初中毕业程度的，一般的均暂时停止理论学习，补习文化；对不识字的干部，要求在二、三年内达到初小毕业程度；对已有高小、初中程度的干部，要求各提高一级。省文教厅规定了学制（初小二年、高小一年、初中三年）、课程与教材，又配备了专职教员。
    目前参加文化学习的干部有八万多人，占全省干部的百分之九十左右。县以上机关都设有干部业余文化补习学校。全省大部分县委委员和部分地委委员，已参加了学习。学员的出席率，大部分地区经常能保持百分之八十左右（下乡干部没有计算在内），少数地区已消灭了旷课现象。现在全省共有业余学校一千零九十四班，专职教员五百六十五人；大部分业余学校已走向正规化，按统一的学制课程进行教学，并订出了考勤、请假、考试等制度。
    经过半年来的学习，干部文化水平逐渐提高了。例如，涉县有六十三个干部，过去一个字也不认识，现在已能看简单的文件、写简单的信件了。沧县专署有十八个没学过算术的人，现在学会了整数加减乘除，有的已学到小数和分数。预计一九五二年年底，仅省直属机关与直属市，即将有四、五十个班达到初中毕业程度。
    在学习中，干部的思想也有了新的转变。最明显的是纠正了一部分干部由于文化程度低所产生的悲观情绪与退休思想。此外，还扩大了干部的眼界，提高了干部的爱国主义思想；纠正了某些农民出身的干部的迷信思想。
    同时，文化学习使干部的工作能力提高了一步。许多干部在获得了初步的文化知识以后，工作和学习时都感到了极大的方便。
    以上情况充分说明了，在职干部是可以把文化学习搞好的；而且，广大工农干部文化水平的提高，主要应依靠在职学习。有些人认为只有离职才能学好的看法是不对的。
  要保证必要的学习条件
    领导在职干部的文化学习，首先要对学习条件给以必要的保证。要使干部能够坚持每天二小时的学习；要配备教员，供给必要的经费设备，建立健全的学习制度，如考勤、请假、考试、作业等。业余学校须与各机关行政及党的支部密切联系，以贯彻上述制度的执行。党的支部应把领导与保证党员干部学习列为经常的和主要的工作之一。负责干部应以身作则，参加学习。因为负责干部文化水平的提高对工作的帮助更大（如地委委员中，有不少还是小学程度）；而且负责干部参加学习以后，能及时了解学习中的问题，设法加强领导；同时还可以起带动的作用。如：唐山地委书记贺秉章同志每天早晨与其他委员相约按时到课，专心听讲；并亲任专区直属机关业余学校校长。定县地委书记王振海同志除坚持各种学习制度外，并注意复习和认真研究。
  克服学习文化的思想障碍
    动员干部学习文化是一个思想斗争过程。领导干部应该加强思想领导，及时纠正各种不正确的认识。过去在土地改革时期，有一部分工农干部曾产生过“老粗光荣”的错误认识，认为只要有经验，没有文化“一样能当干部”，“也一样做工作”。某些干部放不下架子，以为学习文化是降低了自己的政治待遇。有的借口工作忙，不积极学习文化。还有的因为年龄大、记性不好，对学文化没有信心。
    我们曾针对以上情况，着重解决了学员中的思想问题。领导干部强调说明在今后的国家建设工作中，只凭老经验是不行的，号召大家放下架子，当小学生；并说明这正是党对工农干部的关心和爱护。学习开始以后，领导干部又强调从实际出发，号召大家认真学习，巩固学习成果。领导干部以身作则、反复动员；再经过党支部、小组的检查，展开批评与自我批评，才逐步地把这些思想问题大体上解决了。
    在师生关系上，初期有些干部有看不起教员（多是新参加工作的知识分子）的思想，认为教员的政治水平低，教不了自己；甚至发生干部故意与教员为难的现象，使某些教员的工作情绪受到了影响。教员因此也就感到干部不好“侍候”，放松了对学习的领导。解决这个问题的办法，首先是在干部中提倡尊师；其次是在政治上帮助教员，使他们认识到提高工农干部文化水平是一桩艰巨而有意义的工作。凡可以使教员参加的一切政治报告与会议，都设法让他们参加，借以加强教员的政治理论学习，并从政治上提高他们。同时，还要帮助教员根据干部学习的特点，改进教学方法。现在这一问题已基本上解决了，师生关系已趋融洽。
  下乡干部也一样能学习
    县以上机关干部的学习，因经常有一部分干部下乡工作，发展是不平衡的。常下乡的干部往往跟不上功课，有的甚至降班。这是个比较复杂和难以解决的问题。根据我们的经验，解决这个问题的关键主要在于干部的自觉，因为下乡以后学习时间仍然是可以挤出来的；同时，领导上必须加以组织和督促，并从工作中给予一定的预习机会与补课时间。组织下乡学习的办法是：在下乡前由教员有重点地给予预授（授课的多少须根据下乡时间的长短来决定），或发给学习提纲；下乡后实行自学互助，如有困难找当地教员帮助解决；回来时再补课。
    区干部是经常下乡工作的，因此，组织他们学习是文化教员的主要工作。办法是把学习制度与工作制度密切结合起来。区干部每十天或半月大集合时，即进行学习（学习日）；小组每五至七天集合汇报工作时，教员轮流到各组上课，并规定了作业；平时则由小学教员帮助学习。区干部的学习直接由中共区委会领导，县委会每半月召开文化教员会议，汇报与布置工作，交流经验。
    以上办法，在领导干部重视和工作制度正规的地区是执行得比较好的，效果也很好。
