　　Spring in Korea
       Yang Shuo
    We are not forgetful, we still remember the American aggressors' vicious words: "Turn Korea into a desert!"

    They said it, and they did it. I personally saw large tracts of ripe rice fields being doused with gasoline and burned in the fields; whole apple trees, blown up by bombs, lying across the hillsides... But in the rice paddies burned yesterday, the soil is turned over, and the ridges are again planted with lush green seedlings; in the orchards destroyed yesterday, with a gust of east wind, the whole garden sways with a cloud-like expanse of colorful blossoms.

    Spring breaks through the siege of wind and snow and comes to Korea. An anonymous Korean poet wrote in my notebook:

        Spring is beautiful
        In order to build a life as beautiful as spring
        We will not hesitate to water life with blood and sweat!

    These few lines of poetry precisely express the invincible will of the Korean people. I once heard a report from Kim Si-jae, Vice Chairman of the Korean Central Farmers' Union, when he spoke of the towering crimes of the American bandits, he cited several figures: in Hwanghae Province alone, more than 100,000 farmers were victimized, and in South Pyongan Province, a total of more than 27,000 cattle were killed. The extent of the suffering throughout Korea can be imagined. With a shortage of manpower and livestock, wouldn't the land of Korea be barren? This is the enemy's wish, but the reality is not so.

    There is a farmer in Pyongyang named Song Gyeong-jik, wearing a blue robe with white edges on the large collar. The expression on his face is frozen and resolute. One look tells you that he harbors great sorrow in his heart. How could he not be grieved? When the enemy occupied Pyongyang, he retreated to the north. After liberation, when he returned home, all twenty-five members of his family, including relatives, had been brutally murdered by the enemy. He is the only one left in his family, but behind him is the support of the immeasurable strength of the people. When I met him, he said to us: "The enemy killed my family, but they cannot kill my heart! I will dedicate my whole life to fighting the enemy!"

    When spring came, and General Kim Il-sung issued the call: "Sowing is war!" Song Gyeong-jik, and thousands upon thousands of farmers like him, threw themselves into this war. The young and middle-aged men went to the front lines, and the women and children organized themselves and went to the fields collectively. Afraid of enemy aircraft harassment during the day, air-raid shelters were dug at the edges of the fields; what couldn't be finished during the day was done by moonlight. Day and night, you could often see groups of women, some carrying children on their backs, some pulling plows, some sowing seeds, with the women behind standing in a row, hands behind their backs, humming songs, stepping in dance-like steps, using their feet to cultivate the soil. In the shadows of the sun, suddenly a group of young soldiers would flash out, each as lively as a dragon or tiger, full of energy. These were the Chinese People's Volunteers. They still carried the smell of gunpowder and dust from the battlefield. Having just come down from the front lines, they willingly and gladly helped the Korean people as old men, pulling plows and running happily. Those women couldn't express their gratitude, so the young girls ran into the ditches, and in the blink of an eye ran back, their arms full of bunches of wild forsythia flowers, giggling and stuffing handful after handful into the hands of the soldiers...

    Once, I also received a large bouquet of pink forsythia flowers from a young girl, but not in the fields, but in a factory. The girl's name was Min Sun-nyeo, only sixteen years old, and she was an enthusiastic worker (activist) in a textile factory. But she had not been at ease in her work some time ago. The translation comrade said, "She was single-mindedly thinking of joining the army to avenge her father." It turned out that her father was a carpenter in the textile factory, and was kidnapped by the American army last November. Sun-nyeo, her mother, and an eight-year-old younger brother were also kidnapped. The American army deliberately dragged her father out in front of her and her mother. At that time, her father had already been beaten bloody and could not walk. The eight-year-old younger brother cried, and her father said, "I am about to die, remember how I died..." Before he could finish speaking, the enemy had them watch as they shot her father to death, and after he died, they kicked him with their feet! This hatred, Sun-nyeo kept in her heart, and could not forget even in her sleep. When mobilization for military service began a few days ago, she took her meals and rushed to sign up, but she was too young and did not qualify. She was so anxious that she went to demand it every day. Later, she was allowed to join the factory's armed self-defense force, and only then did she feel at ease. Now she personally draws up production plans, and completes work that used to take thirty days in twenty days. When some workers went to the front lines, Sun-nyeo said as she saw them off, "Go with peace of mind, we will definitely complete the tasks you are going to complete!"

    This is the Korean worker who has been tempered by the sea of ​​blood and deep hatred created by the American aggressors. They all understand one truth: "Without the front, there is no rear; without the rear, there is no front!" As soon as a city was liberated, all the electricity in the textile factory was destroyed by the enemy. Without restoring electricity first, production could not be restored. Fei Dong-kui led six electricians to carry out repairs. Because they could not get food locally, they were half-starved every day. When working on the 20-meter-high high-voltage lines, they did not come down even when enemy planes bombed them. In five days, they finally repaired it, and the machines also turned. With the same team, in another five days, the electricity in the agricultural tool factory was also restored. These workers are so tenacious. Once production begins, the workers will never stop until the enemy planes are over their heads. They work during the day and repair roads at night. If the roads are not repaired, how can the great army of the Chinese and Korean people advance? To the motherland, to the people, they have also universally launched a swearing movement: "No matter how difficult the circumstances, resolutely carry out the mission given by the motherland!"

    At a night meeting, a grain factory warmly entertained a group of friends from China. There was wine, biscuits, white sugar, soy sauce, etc. on the table. The planes were humming overhead, and the bombs were shaking the house, but the workers were as calm as mountains, their faces unchanged. One worker raised his glass and said: "The things we are using to entertain our guests today are very simple, but this is the first batch of products after our factory was restored, mainly to ensure the supply to the front lines."

    Our comrade immediately raised his glass and stood up and said: "Please drink this victory wine! This wine was produced under enemy bombing and destruction. It not only demonstrates the victory of the Korean people's production, but also guarantees the victory of the war on the front lines!"

    Spring comes to Korea. The life that the Korean people watered with blood and sweat will surely bloom with beautiful flowers. Those man-eating savages hanging the signboard of civilization cannot turn the earth backwards, and will never be able to destroy the bright and brilliant world. I remember one night when I was driving through Pyongyang, a magnificent song suddenly came from a loudspeaker on the rubble field. This is the "Song of General Kim Il-sung", and also the battle song of the Korean people. Stepping on this battle song, the Korean people are heading towards the eternal spring of mankind.

　　春在朝鲜
       杨朔
    我们并不健忘，还记得美国侵略者那句恶毒话：“把朝鲜变成沙漠!”
    他们这样说了，也这样做了。我曾亲眼看见大片大片熟透的稻子被敌人浇上汽油，烧在地里；整棵整棵的苹果树被炸弹炸后，横在半山坡上……但是就在昨天烧毁的稻田里，土翻过来，满畦又插上碧绿的秧苗；就在昨天破坏的果树园里，东风一吹，满园摆动着一片彩云似的花朵。
    春天突破风雪的重围，来到朝鲜。一位朝鲜无名诗人在我的手册上写道：
        春天是美好的
        为了建设我们像春天一样美好的生活
        我们不惜用血汗去浇灌生活！
    这几句诗，正表现了朝鲜人民不可征服的意志。我曾经听过朝鲜中央农民同盟副委员长金时哉的报告，讲到美国强盗的滔天罪恶时，他举出几个数目字说：仅仅黄海道一带，被害的农民就有十几万人，平安南道被杀死的牛一共就是两万七千多头。全朝鲜受害的情形，可想而知。人力缺，畜力缺，朝鲜的土地不就荒了？这是敌人的愿望，事实可不如此。
    平壤有个农民，叫宋景稷，穿着青袍子，大领子镶着白边，脸上的表情凝滞而刚毅，一望就知道他内心隐藏着绝大的悲痛。他怎能不痛心呢？敌人占领平壤时，他撤到北地，解放后回家一看，全家连亲属二十五口，统统叫敌人残杀了。他家只剩他一个人，但他的背后却有无比的人民力量支持着他。我见到他时，他对我们说：“敌人杀死我的家口，杀不死我的心！我要献出整个生命，跟敌人斗争！”
    春天一来，当金日成将军发出号召：“播种就是战争！”宋景稷，以及千千万万像他这样的农民，都投进这个战争里了。壮年男子上了前线，妇女儿童都组织起来，集体下地。白天怕敌机骚扰，地头挖上防空洞；日里做不完，月亮地再去。朝朝夜夜，你时常可以看见一伙一伙的妇女，有的背上背着小孩，拉犁的拉犁，撒种的撒种，后边的妇女站成一溜，背着手，哼着歌，踏着像舞蹈的步子，用两脚培着土。太阳影里，忽然会闪出一群青年战士，一个个生龙活虎似的，浑身充满精力。这是中国志愿军来了。他们身上还带着弹药的气味，脸上蒙着战场的风尘，刚从火线下来，就架起枪，甘心情愿替朝鲜人民当老年，拉起犁耍着欢跑。那些妇女没法表示她们的感谢了，少女们跑进沟去，一霎眼又跑回来，满怀抱着大把的野迎春，“金大莱”花，格格地笑着，一把一把塞到战士们的手里……
    有一回，我也从一位少女手里接到过一大捧粉红色的“金大莱”花，不过不是在田野，而是在工厂里。那少女叫闵顺女，才十六岁，是一家纺织工厂的热情劳动者（积极分子）。但她前些时候曾经不大安心做事。翻译同志说：“她一心一意只想参军，替父亲报仇。”原来她父亲是纺织厂的木匠，去年十一月叫美军绑去了，顺女母女跟一个八岁的小兄弟也叫绑去了。美军故意当着她母女的面，把她父亲拖出来。那时她父亲已经被打的浑身是血，不能走路。八岁的小兄弟哭起来，她父亲说：“我就要死了，记住我是怎么死的……”没等话说完，敌人就叫她们母女看着，开枪把她父亲打死，死后还用脚踢！这个仇，顺女记在心里，睡觉也不能忘。头些天动员参军，她带着饭，抢着去报名，可是年纪太小，不合格，急的她什么似的，天天去要求，后来允许她参加工厂武装自卫队，才算安心。现在她亲自订出生产计划，二十天就完成了过去要三十天才能完成的工作。有些工友上前线，送他们走时，顺女说：“你们放心走吧，我们一定完成你们所要完成的任务！”
    这就是从美国侵略者造成的血海深仇中锻炼出来的朝鲜工人。他们都明白一个真理：“没有前方就没有后方，没有后方就没有前方！”一座城市刚解放，纺织工厂的电力全部被敌人破坏了。不首先恢复电力，就不能恢复生产。斐东奎带着六个电工进行修复工作，因为当地弄不到粮食，天天半饥半饱。在二十米高的高压线上工作时，敌机轰炸也不下来，五天光景，到底修好了，机器也转了。原班人马，再一个五天，农具工厂的电力也恢复起来了。这些工人，就这样顽强。生产一开始，敌机不到头上，工人决不停手。白天做活，夜晚还去修路。不修路，中朝人民大军如何前进？向祖国，向人民，他们又普遍展开宣誓运动：“不论在任何艰苦情况下，坚决执行祖国所给的使命！”
    在一次夜会上，一家谷产工厂热烈招待了我们一群从中国来的朋友。棹子上摆着酒，饼干、白糖、酱油等等。头上的飞机嗡嗡响，炸弹震的房子乱摇，工人们却像山一样镇定，脸色不改。一个工人举起酒杯说：“今天招待客人的东西，非常简陋，不过这是我们工厂恢复后第一批出品，主要是为了保证前线的供给。”
    我们的同志立刻擎着杯子站起身说：“请喝这一杯胜利酒！这酒是在敌人轰炸破坏下出的，不但表现了朝鲜人民生产的胜利，也保证了前线战争的胜利！”
    春天来到朝鲜。朝鲜人民用血汗浇灌的生活，定会开出美丽的花朵。那些挂着文明幌子的食人生番不能扳着地球倒转，就永远不能毁灭光明灿烂的世界。还记得一夜我乘车路过平壤，瓦砾场上忽然有播音器传出雄壮的歌声。这是“金日成将军之歌”，也是朝鲜人民的战歌。踏着这个战歌，朝鲜人民正在走向人类永久的春天。
