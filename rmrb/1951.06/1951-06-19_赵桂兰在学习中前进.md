Party Life

　　Zhao Guilan Advances in Learning
　　Zhang Lanping
    Zhao Guilan, a good daughter of the Party, completed her first year of study plan assigned by the Party with the tenacious fighting spirit of a Communist Party member. Now that the 30th anniversary of the Party is approaching, Zhao Guilan is deeply moved when she recalls the care and love the Party and the people showed her after she was injured while rescuing the factory. She said, "After I was injured, the Party not only gave me excellent treatment but also helped me to learn culture... To repay the Party's care and expectations, I can only study harder, further improve my political awareness and cultural level, and prepare to engage in intellectual work (because she is disabled and can no longer engage in physical labor)." Zhao Guilan is now stepping up her studies with infinite excitement to welcome the Party's birthday.
    Zhao Guilan went to the Cultural Class of the CPC Lushun-Dalian Party School to study in early June last year. Over the past year, Zhao Guilan has traveled to Beijing twice to attend meetings and participated in other meetings in Lushun-Dalian. Therefore, her actual study time at the school was only eight months. Although her study time was shorter than that of other students, she completed the one-year course like the other students. Zhao Guilan had many difficulties in learning: a hand with only three fingers made it very inconvenient to hold a pen. When she first arrived at school, others wrote three times, but she could only write twice. In addition, the weather in June was very hot, and she often sweated all over and felt dizzy. Zhao Guilan was not subdued by these difficulties; she went out to get some air and continued to write. She even read in bed at night. Therefore, the school raised concerns about her, asking her to pay attention to protecting her health.
    In her studies, Zhao Guilan often kept in mind the instructions of the responsible comrades of the Party organization: "We must work hard to learn culture and politics; we must not only be brave but also have wisdom..." Zhao Guilan's demands on herself were very strict, and she was not complacent because of her hard work. She often said, "Comrade Qi Guizhi only studied at school for a little over a year before entering the Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Course Middle School and will go on to Renmin University in the future. What about me? I have also studied for a year. What can I do? I must work harder in the future." (Note: Qi Guizhi originally had a foundation of two years of cultural study.) In order to learn better, Zhao Guilan began to keep a diary from New Year's Day this year.
    Zhao Guilan also actively participated in various political and other activities in the school. When the school launched a study competition from February 16 to the end of April this year, Zhao Guilan participated in the competition. The learning plan for their class in the competition was to recognize 400 to 500 characters and to try to achieve "four abilities" (being able to read, speak, use, and write). Zhao Guilan worked hard in this direction, determined to complete the plan. She said, "The Party has great expectations of me. How can I live up to the Party if I don't study hard?" Zhao Guilan also understood that it was not enough to just "work hard" in learning. The responsible comrades of the Party organization also repeatedly instructed that attention should be paid to physical health in learning. Zhao Guilan often used her brain to think of learning methods and ask others for advice. She stipulated that in addition to completing the lessons and homework taught by the teachers every day, she also read the *Workers' Correspondence* given by the *Workers' Daily*, the local edition of the *Lushun-Dalian People's Daily*, etc. When she encountered words she did not recognize, she underlined them in red and asked others for advice. Zhao Guilan said, "I always remember Chairman Mao's words: If you don't understand, you don't understand; you can't pretend to understand." She also said, "Whoever knows is my teacher, and I will learn from him respectfully." Zhao Guilan studied diligently and earnestly in this way. This nationally renowned model of factory protection received a letter every two or three days. These letters came from local areas, other provinces, overseas Chinese, and international friends. Zhao Guilan read these letters carefully and wrote back. Therefore, she learned a lot from these letters.
    Zhao Guilan exceeded her task in learning. In the competition, she recognized more than 700 more characters, and more than 600 characters achieved the ability to read, speak, use, and write. In the final exam at the end of the competition, Zhao Guilan's overall average score in Chinese (reading, speaking, writing, answering), arithmetic, and nature was 97.9 points, ranking second in the school's cultural class. Zhao Guilan is advancing rapidly and strongly in learning in this way. The students were all surprised by Zhao Guilan's academic performance. They all said, "She often goes out to attend meetings, and her health is not as good as ours. How can she study so well?" What power enables her to keep moving forward? She said, "The Party is encouraging me, Chairman Mao is encouraging me, and the people are encouraging me." (Attached picture)

　　赵桂兰在学习中前进
　　张兰萍
    党的好女儿赵桂兰，以共产党员的顽强战斗精神，完成了党所交给她的第一年的学习计划。现在党的三十周年纪念日快到了。赵桂兰回想到自己因抢救工厂负伤，党与人民对她的关怀与爱护，十分感动。她说：“我负伤后，党不但给我治疗得很好，而且帮助我学习文化。……为了回答党对我的关怀与期望，我只有更好的学习，进一步提高自己的政治觉悟和文化水平，准备努力从事智力劳动（因她残废了，不能再从事体力劳动）。”赵桂兰现在正以无限兴奋的心情，加紧学习，迎接党的生日。
    赵桂兰是去年六月初到中共旅大党校文化班去学习的。一年来，赵桂兰因两次到北京开会，又在旅大参加了其他会议，所以，她在校内的学习时间，实际不过八个月。她的学习时间虽较其他同学为短；但是，她到底和其他同学一样地完成了一年的课程。赵桂兰学习起来是有很多困难的：一只只有三个指头的手，拿笔很不方便。初到学校时，别人写字写三遍，她只能写两遍；又加六月天气很热，常常写得满身是汗，头昏眼花。赵桂兰并不被这困难屈服，她出去吹吹风回来继续写下去。甚至晚上在被窝里，还在阅读。校方因此对她提出了意见，要她注意保护身体。
    赵桂兰在学习中，时常记着党组织负责同志的嘱咐：“要努力学习文化，学习政治；不但要勇敢，而且还得有智慧……。”赵桂兰对自己的要求非常苛刻，并不因为努力学习而自满，她常常说：“戚桂芝同志在学校只学习了一年多，就进工农速成中学了，将来还要升人民大学。我呢？也学习一年了，能做什么？今后可得更加劲。”（按：戚桂芝原来有两年文化学习的基础）赵桂兰为了学习得更好，从今年元旦起，开始学记日记。
    赵桂兰还积极地参加了学校里的各种政治活动与其他活动。当学校在今年二月十六日到四月底开展学习竞赛时，赵桂兰就参加了这次竞赛。她们一班在竞赛中的学习计划是识四百到五百个字，并要尽量做到“四会”（会念、会讲、会用、会写）。赵桂兰就向这方面努力，坚决要完成计划。她说：“党对我的期望很大，要不努力学习，怎能对得起党呢？”赵桂兰并且懂得了学习中光“死拚”还不行，党组织负责同志也再三嘱咐，在学习中还要注意身体健康。赵桂兰便时时动脑筋想学习办法和请教别人。她规定每天除了完成教员教的功课和作业以外，还阅读工人日报赠送的《工人通讯》、旅大人民日报的地方版等；遇到认不得的字便划上红线，请教别人。赵桂兰说：“我时时刻刻想着毛主席的话：不懂就是不懂，不能装懂。”又说：“谁会谁就是我的老师，我就要恭恭敬敬地向他学习。”赵桂兰就这样虚心地钻研，努力地学习着。这个闻名全国的护厂模范，二、三天就能接到一封信。这些信中，本地的、外省的、华侨的、国际朋友的都有。赵桂兰对这些信都是仔细地阅读，并写回信。因此，她从这些信里又学到很多东西。
    赵桂兰在学习上超过了任务。在竞赛运动中又识了七百多字，并且有六百多字做到了会读、会讲、会用、会写。竞赛结束的总考试，赵桂兰的国文（读、讲、写、答）、算术、自然等功课总平均为九十七点九分，为全校文化班第二名。赵桂兰在学习中，就是这样迅速而坚强地前进着。同学们都为赵桂兰的学习成绩惊奇。都说：“人家常出去开会，身体又不如咱，怎么学习得这样好呢？”什么力量使得她能不断前进呢？她说：“党在鼓舞着我，毛主席在鼓舞着我，人民在鼓舞着我。”（附图片）
