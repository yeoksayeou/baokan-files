Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 14th: In recent combat operations, many meritorious units and individuals have emerged in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; they have been commended or awarded meritorious service by higher leading organs.

　　During the second phase of the spring counterattack, a certain unit of the infantry force, with courageous and swift actions, annihilated two enemy companies (less one platoon) in three hours, occupied 18 enemy bunkers in succession, seized a certain high ground, and completed the tasks assigned by the higher authorities. Subsequently, the unit was ordered to defend positions such as Jiao Yifeng, Shannei Yi, and Jiao Xie Peak. The unit resolutely executed the orders, constructed fortifications day and night, and defended for six days and nights, inflicting heavy casualties on the advancing enemy forces, and thus won a commendation from the Volunteer Army leading organ.

　　In the defensive battles, many infantry units also created examples of winning with fewer troops by means of heroic and resourceful combat. On June 3, the enemy attacked the position defended by the Third Battalion of a certain Volunteer Army unit east of Lianchuan Shuhe Li with a regiment of troops. The battalion stubbornly resisted the enemy and constantly launched counterattacks, killing or wounding more than 300 enemy soldiers after four days and nights of combat. When the Eighth Company of another unit was defending a certain position, it repelled seven encirclements launched by the enemy from three sides within one day and launched six counterattacks against the enemy, killing or wounding more than 200 enemy soldiers, forcing the enemy to retreat, leaving more than ten bodies behind. The Second Company of another unit was defending a certain position. Under the fierce attack of the enemy's superior forces, the company temporarily withdrew from the position and launched a counterattack against the enemy that night. After three hours of fighting, the position was recovered, and in addition to eliminating more than 20 enemy soldiers, it also seized more than 40 pieces of equipment such as rocket launchers, 60 mortars, machine guns, carbines, and automatic rifles. All the above units have been commended by the leading organs of their respective forces. The Third Battalion of a certain unit, which defended the Shuhe Li position, was awarded a special class merit once, and Battalion Commander Luo Jinzhang and Instructor Ma Shufeng were awarded personal merits for their calm command.

　　Many artillery units have been praised by the infantry for successfully completing their tasks in coordinating with infantry operations. During the period of coordinating with a certain infantry unit in combat, a certain artillery unit took the initiative to introduce the situation to the infantry commander and request combat missions; after the infantry broke through the enemy's position, they immediately automatically surveyed the roads and followed the infantry forward. In the second phase of the counterattack, the unit overcame difficulties, rushed to the predetermined position, and participated in the battle on time. During the battle, the unit also paid attention to strengthening communication and liaison and increasing observation posts to enable close coordination between the infantry and artillery. Another artillery unit also took the initiative to request missions from the infantry commander and calmly and accurately persisted in firing under the combined bombing of the enemy's air force and artillery. In the second phase of the counterattack, the unit wounded more than 300 enemy soldiers and destroyed one enemy tank. The unit was also able to implement the principle of supporting the war with war, paying attention to collecting enemy artillery shells on the battlefield to retaliate against the enemy. At the request of the infantry unit, the Volunteer Army leading organ has commended and awarded the above two artillery units separately.

　　Many infantry units and anti-aircraft artillery units have been commended for their anti-aircraft fire. From May 16 to June 6, a certain unit shot down 28 enemy aircraft and damaged 12 enemy aircraft with ten types of weapons. A certain anti-aircraft artillery company shot down five enemy aircraft in two days. A certain battalion shot down or damaged eleven enemy aircraft in three days. The anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding a certain bridge shot down or damaged thirteen enemy aircraft in fifteen days, and the unit also carried out point firing against the enemy aircraft, saving a lot of ammunition. All the above units have been commended by the higher leading organs.

　　In anti-tank operations, there are also many model units and individuals. The Second Platoon of a certain unit launched a fierce battle with British tanks on the highway near Matian, north of the Linjin River, creating brilliant results: a total of three enemy tanks were destroyed, four tanks were damaged, one small armored vehicle was destroyed, two jeeps were destroyed, one ambulance was destroyed, 59 enemies were captured, and more than 50 enemies were killed or wounded. The platoon was therefore awarded a special class collective merit once. Wu Chou, the leader of a combat team in a certain unit, and his team were also awarded a special class merit for destroying one enemy tank and one enemy vehicle, and eliminating more than 40 enemies. Jiang Yansong, a squad leader of another unit, destroyed two enemy tanks and damaged one tank with three grenades, and later died heroically. The superior leading organ of the unit specially posthumously awarded Comrade Jiang Yansong a special class merit to express condolences.

    【新华社朝鲜前线十四日电】在最近期间的作战中，中国人民志愿军里又出现了许多有功的单位和人物；他们已经分别受到上级领导机关的通报表扬或记功奖励。
    步兵部队某部在春季反击战第二阶段中，曾经以勇猛迅速的动作，在三小时内歼灭敌人两个连（缺一个排），连占敌人地堡十八座，夺取了某高地，完成了上级所给予的任务。接着该部又先后奉命守备角屹峰、山内峓、脚歇峰等阵地。该部坚决执行命令，日夜构筑阵地，坚守了六昼夜，予进犯敌军以重大杀伤，因而荣获志愿军领导机关的通报表扬。
    在守备战中，步兵部队还有许多单位以英勇机智的作战创造了以少胜多的范例。六月三日，敌人以一个团的兵力，向涟川以东水合里志愿军某部三营守备的阵地猛攻。该营顽强迎击敌军，并且不断举行反击，经过四昼夜作战，杀伤敌军三百余名。另部第八连在守备某阵地时，一天之内击退敌人从三面发动的七次围攻，并且向敌军举行了六次反击，杀伤敌人二百多名，迫使敌人遗尸十多具而退。另部第二连防守某阵地，在敌军优势兵力的猛攻下，该连暂时撤离阵地，于当晚向敌人发起反击，经三小时战斗后将阵地收复，除歼敌人二十多名外，还缴获火箭炮、六零炮、机关炮、卡宾枪、自动步枪等四十余件。上述各单位都已受到各该部队领导机关的通报表扬。坚守水合里阵地的某部第三营并荣记特等功一次，营长罗金长、教导员马树封因指挥沉着，个人又受到记功的奖励。
    许多炮兵部队在配合步兵作战中，由于圆满完成任务，受到了步兵的赞扬。某炮兵部队在配合某步兵部队作战期间，主动向步兵指挥员介绍情况，请求战斗任务；在步兵突破敌人阵地以后，又立即自动勘察道路，跟随步兵前进。在反击战第二阶段，该部克服困难，赶往预定阵地，准时参加作战。在作战过程中，该部并注意加强通讯联络、增加观测所，使步兵与炮兵密切协同作战。另一炮兵部队也向步兵指挥员主动请求任务，并且在敌人的空军、炮兵联合轰击下，沉着准确地坚持射击。在反击战第二阶段中，该部曾经击伤敌军三百多名，击毁敌坦克一辆。该部并能执行以战养战的方针，注意在战场上收集敌军炮弹，用来还击敌军。志愿军领导机关应步兵部队的请求，已经对上述两炮兵部队分别予以表扬、记功。
    在对空射击中，有不少步兵部队和高射炮部队受到表扬。某部从五月十六日至六月六日用十种武器击落敌机二十八架，击伤敌机十二架。某高射炮连在两天内击落敌机五架。某营在三天中击落击伤敌机十一架。守卫某桥梁的高射炮部队，在十五天中击落击伤敌机十三架，该部并对敌机实行点发射击，节省了许多弹药。上述各单位都已受到上级领导机关的通报表扬。
    在反坦克作战中，也有不少模范单位和人物。某部第二排在临津江北岸麻田附近公路上与英军坦克展开激战，创造了辉煌战绩：计击毁敌军坦克三辆，击伤坦克四辆，击毁小型装甲车一辆，吉普车两辆，救护车一辆，俘敌五十九名，毙伤敌五十余名。该排因而荣获记特等集体功一次。某部战斗小组长伍丑带领的小组，也因击毁敌军坦克和汽车各一辆，并歼敌四十余名而荣记特等功一次。另部班长姜彦松用三颗手雷击毁敌军坦克二辆，击伤坦克一辆，后来壮烈牺牲。该部上级领导机关特给姜彦松烈士追记特等功一次，以志悼念。
