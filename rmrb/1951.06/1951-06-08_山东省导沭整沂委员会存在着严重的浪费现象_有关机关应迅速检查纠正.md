To the Editor:

The Shandong Province Daoshu Zheng-Yi Committee has serious waste issues in the procurement and storage of tools and equipment, lacking proper systems and planning, causing significant losses to state assets. I am writing to report some of the situations I am aware of, hoping that the relevant authorities will investigate and handle them.

First, the committee purchased fifty wooden boats, intending to transport goods on the river, but due to the lack of water in the river, the fifty wooden boats were never used, resulting in a waste of 60,468,000 yuan.

Second, 19,718 baskets were purchased for carrying soil, costing 83,216 catties of wheat grain and over 440,000 yuan. However, the construction workers used small carts to transport the soil and carrying baskets to transport stones, rendering these baskets unused. Both of these losses were caused by a lack of detailed investigation and research beforehand.

Third, last year, 5,000 catties of insulated electrical wire were purchased from Qingdao. Upon inspection, only 4,300 catties were found, a shortage of 700 catties. Moreover, these 4,300 catties were fire-damaged, with the insulation rendered useless, resulting in them being stored in the warehouse and unusable.

Fourth, the loss of tools is also severe. Last year, a total of 3,220 pickaxes, 1,588 mattocks, and 14,281 pickaxe handles were lost. The combined loss of these three items is equivalent to 141,473 catties of autumn grain.

The above are just a few of the major losses that have been discovered. The leadership of our organization has never seriously addressed such important matters, leading some individuals to think of taking advantage of the situation. For example, staff member Chen Shilin privately borrowed nearly 2,000,000 yuan of public funds when he went to Qingdao, and still owes 1,100,000 yuan.

In order to make the best use of materials and personnel and successfully complete the people's water conservancy projects, I hope the relevant departments will quickly investigate and handle this matter.

### 山东省导沭整沂委员会存在着严重的浪费现象  有关机关应迅速检查纠正

　　山东省导沭整沂委员会存在着严重的浪费现象
    有关机关应迅速检查纠正编辑同志：
    山东省导沭整沂委员会，在采购与保管工具及器材方面，缺乏制度，缺乏计划，使国家资财受到很大损失。现在把我知道的一些情况写出来，希望主管部门能调查处理。一、该委员会曾买了五十只木船，准备在河里运东西，但因河内无水五十只木船并未使用，这就白白地积压了六亿零四十六万八千元。二、买了背土用的筐子一万九千七百一十八个，用去麦粮八万三千二百一十六斤及款子四十四万余元，但是施工地方的民工们是用小车推土，用抬筐抬运石头，这批筐子也没用上。以上两项损失，都是因事先没有详细地调查研究造成的。三、去年从青岛买了五千斤包皮电线，回来验收时，只有四千三百斤，短少七百斤；而且这四千三百斤也是火烧过的，包皮已失去作用，结果都堆存在仓库里，不能使用。四、工具丢失也是很严重的，去年共丢失洋镐三千二百二十个，橛头一千五百八十八个，洋镐把一万四千二百八十一根，这三项损失共合秋粮十四万一千四百七十三斤。
    以上仅是已发现的损失中几项较大的损失。对于这样大事，我们机关的领导方面从来未作严肃的处理，以致某些人员有从中乱摸一把的想法。如职员陈士林到青岛时即私自借用公款近二百万元，现在还欠公款一百一十余万元。为了能做到物尽其用，人尽其职，很好地完成人民的水利事业，希望有关部门赶快调查处理这件事情。
