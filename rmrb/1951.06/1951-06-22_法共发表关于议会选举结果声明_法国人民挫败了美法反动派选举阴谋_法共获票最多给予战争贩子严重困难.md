Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 20th (TASS dispatch): The French Communist Party has issued the following statement regarding the results of the French parliamentary elections:

　　The list of candidates of the Republican Anti-Fascist Resistance League, proposed by the French Communist Party, received five million votes. In this election, the Communist Party once again greatly surpassed other parties, especially the fascist party "Rally of the French People." Therefore, neither the slander nor the provocative and repressive measures taken since the exclusion of the various Communist Party ministers from the government have been able to shake the decisive influence of the French Communist Party on the people nationwide, nor have they been able to prevent the French Communist Party from consolidating its position among the working class.

　　The Communist Party's list of candidates, which received five million votes, has given the warmongers a serious difficulty. The victory on June 17th is the result of the correct policy of unity implemented by the Communist Party, and the result of the Communist Party's unremitting struggle for national independence and peace, for progress and freedom. This victory is due to the selfless work of countless party members and sympathizers of the Party. This victory is the achievement of their efforts.

　　The American tycoons and their French lackeys hoped that the election would weaken the Communist Party, and that the hideous alliance system would reduce the Communist Party members to only a few. But the French people thwarted this plot. They elected more than one hundred Communist Party members. However, due to the fraud of the election, our party was robbed of dozens of seats. In many provinces, according to the number of votes received, the Communist Party's list of candidates ranked first, but it did not get a single seat, while other lists of candidates with fewer votes got several seats instead.

　　In this regard, the election results emphasized the hypocrisy and formalism of the so-called Western democratic plutocrats' democracy. The new National Assembly has many illegally elected members. Therefore, it can never express the will of the people.

　　In this situation, since the working class and the democratic forces have been deprived of their legitimate representation in the National Assembly, they will adopt other forms of action necessary to defend their demands, defend peace, and win true democracy, to supplement parliamentary activities, because parliamentary activities have been maimed.

　　The right-wing Socialist Party leaders, using their alliance and their entire policy, made it possible for a majority to be formed in the new National Assembly to produce an openly reactionary and pro-fascist government, the only concern of which will be to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of their American masters without the slightest deviation, increase the already heavy tax burden, raise the already high cost of living, trample on democratic freedom, undermine the peaceful nature of education, abolish social welfare, accelerate the preparation for a terrible war, and prepare the way for the "Rally of the French People" and its fascist leader de Gaulle to come to power. The right-wing Socialist Party leaders bear a grave responsibility for this matter.

　　法共发表关于议会选举结果声明
    法国人民挫败了美法反动派选举阴谋
    法共获票最多给予战争贩子严重困难
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：法国共产党顷发表关于法国议会选举结果的声明如下：
    法国共产党所提出的共和反法西斯抵抗联盟的候选人名单，获得了五百万票。在这次选举中，共产党再一次大大胜过了其他党派，特别是法西斯政党“法兰西人民联盟”。因此，无论是诽谤或是自从把各个共产党员部长排除出政府以来所采取的挑衅和镇压手段，既没有能够动摇法国共产党对全国人民的决定性的影响，也没有能够阻止法国共产党巩固自己在工人阶级中间的地位。
    共产党的候选名单，获得了五百万选票，这给了战争贩子一个严重的困难。六月十七日的胜利，是共产党所实行的正确的团结政策的结果，是共产党为争取民族独立与和平，争取进步和自由而毫不懈怠地进行斗争的结果。这次胜利，是共产党无数党员和党的同情者忘我地工作所造成的。这次胜利，是他们努力的成绩。
    美国的富豪和他们的法国奴仆们希望选举会削弱共产党，而且希望用狰狞丑恶的联盟制度，会把共产党议员削减到只剩几个人。但是法国人民挫败了这个阴谋。他们选出了一百多个共产党议员。然而，由于选举的骗局，我党被人劫去了几十个议席。在许多省份，按所得到的票数，共产党的候选名单占第一位，可是一个议席也没有得到，而其他得票较少的候选名单，反而得到了若干议席。
    在这方面，选举结果着重说明了所谓西方民主富人的民主的虚伪的和形式主义的本质。新的国民议会有许多非法当选的议员。因此它决不能表达人民的意志。
    在这种情况下，工人阶级和民主力量，既然被剥夺了他们在国民议会中正当的代表权，就将采用为保卫自己的要求，保卫和平，赢得真正的民主所必要的其他形式的行动，来补充议会活动，因为议会活动已经受到残害了。
    右翼社会党领袖们利用他们的联盟和他们的全部政策，使新的国民议会中得以形成一个多数，以产生公然反动的和亲法西斯的政府，这个政府所唯一关心的，将是丝毫不爽地履行他们美国主子的有增无已的要求，增加已经很重的捐税负担，提高已经高昂的生活费用，蹂躏民主自由，破坏教育的和平性质，取消社会福利，加速准备可怕的战争以及为“法兰西人民联盟”和它的法西斯首领戴高乐准备上台的道路。右翼社会党领袖对于这件事情负有严重的责任。
