Xinhua News Agency, June 18th:

　　Amidst the U.S. government's implementation of a wage freeze policy due to war preparations and the intensified exploitation of workers through the "speed-up system," strikes held by American workers to defend their interests have been occurring frequently recently.

　　On June 16th, 60,000 seamen from twenty-three ports on the U.S. East Coast went on strike because the capitalists refused to increase wages and improve working conditions. The striking workers belong to the National Maritime Union of the CIO, the National Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association, and the American Radio Telegraphists Association. The strike has caused about 650 ships to be idled. On June 12th, more than 65,000 garment workers in New York City, Connecticut, and New Jersey held the largest strike in the garment industry in 25 years. On June 11th, 2,400 workers at the Cleveland American Aluminum Company announced a strike despite opposition from reactionary union leaders. About 1,000 bakers in New England also held a strike for several days to improve working conditions. The strike of 6,000 members of the Agricultural Workers Union affiliated with the AFL has entered its third week. 12,000 transportation workers in New York City have decided to strike on July 1st if their demands for wage increases are not met.

　　Workers in industries producing government military orders are very dissatisfied with the "speed-up system." On June 14th, more than 7,000 workers at the Goodyear Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio, and more than 11,000 auto workers in Detroit went on strike. About 6,000 workers at the Goodyear aircraft factory also expressed opposition to the "speed-up system." Such strikes have even affected government-run so-called "defense" factories. Approximately 3,000 workers at the newly built atomic energy plant in Paducah, Kentucky, held a one-day grievance strike on June 12th.

　　反对备战冻结工资政策        
    美罢工事件不断发生
    【新华社十八日讯】在美国政府因为备战而实行冻结工资政策并以“赶快制度”加紧剥削工人的情况下，美国工人为保卫自己利益而举行的罢工，最近不断发生。
    六月十六日，美国东海岸二十三个港口的六万海员举行罢工，罢工的原因是因为资方拒绝增加工资和改善工人工作条件。罢工工人属于产联的全国海员工会、全国海船司机福利协会和美国无线电报务员工会。罢工已使约六百五十艘船只停航。六月十二日，纽约市、康涅狄格州和新泽西州的六万五千多服装工人举行了服装工业中二十五年来第一次最大的罢工。六月十一日，克利夫兰美国铝公司的二千四百名工人不顾反动工会领袖的反对宣布了罢工。新英格兰约一千面包工人也曾为改善工作条件举行罢工，罢工持续了好几天。劳联所属农业工人工会的六千名会员的罢工已进入第三周。纽约市一万二千运输工人已决定若不答应他们增加工资的要求，将于七月一日罢工。
    生产政府军事定货的工业中的工人很不满“赶快制度”。六月十四日，俄亥俄州阿克伦城固特异橡胶公司的七千多工人和底特律城一万一千多汽车工人罢工。固特异飞机工厂约六千工人也表示反对“赶快制度”。这种罢工甚至也波及到了政府直辖的所谓“国防”工厂。肯塔基州巴丢卡地方新建的原子能工厂的约三千个工人，曾于六月十二日举行了一天的诉苦罢工。
