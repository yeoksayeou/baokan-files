　　The People's Government of Pingyuan Province
　　Specifically Arranges Cotton Purchase and Storage Work
　　And Combines This Work with In-Depth Patriotic Education
According to the current cotton stock in the province, the People's Government of Pingyuan Province has specifically allocated the task of purchasing and storing cotton to various special districts, and has made various preparations for purchasing and storing cotton. It is estimated that by the end of May this year, the province's cotton stock is equivalent to about 12 to 15 percent of the province's total cotton production last year.

The province has decided to conduct in-depth publicity and education work in cotton-producing areas, so that farmers understand that selling cotton to the state or storing it in the state is a patriotic action to ensure national military and civilian needs, stabilize prices, support industrial production, and strengthen the forces to resist US aggression and aid Korea. At the same time, the province has also made necessary adjustments to cotton prices. Since June 1st, except for some areas still under negotiation, the price of cotton per catty in various internal markets in the province has increased by 400 to 800 yuan compared with before the adjustment. Seed cotton is priced according to the actual ginning rate (in the past, seed cotton was not priced according to the ginning rate, but was priced at three catties of seed cotton equivalent to one catty of ginned cotton, which was unreasonable). In the seed cotton market in cotton-producing areas, flower, yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives are responsible for organizing local private flower firms to purchase and process seed cotton for the state. In order to prevent speculation by private merchants, market management methods have been determined: establish exchanges in local markets, organize flower firms to trade at listed prices in the exchanges; and try to meet the needs of legitimate merchants with licenses and farmers' self-use cotton purchases. Resolutely ban illegal activities such as speculation, hoarding, adulteration, and price gouging by flower firms and private merchants.

In addition, the province's state-owned specialized companies have formulated material supply plans for June, July, and August respectively, so that the grain, yarn, cloth, general merchandise, coal, salt, and other necessities required by cotton-producing areas can be met in a timely manner, and the price stability of cotton-producing areas can be guaranteed. In order to take care of the food needs of cotton-producing areas, it is determined that cotton farmers can use cotton to offset public grain.

　　平原省人民政府         
　  具体布置购棉储棉工作           
　　并结合这项工作深入开展爱国教育
    平原省人民政府根据该省目前存棉情况，已把购棉储棉任务具体分配到各专区，且已作了购棉、储棉的各种准备工作。今年五月底估计，该省存棉量相当于去年全省产棉量的百分之十二至十五左右。
    该省决定在棉区深入进行宣传教育工作，使农民了解把棉花卖给国家或储存于国家，是保证全国军需民用、稳定物价、支持工业生产、加强抗美援朝力量的爱国行动。同时，全省棉价亦做了必要的调整。自六月一日起，除部分地区尚在协商外，省内各内市场棉花每斤价格均较未调整前提高四百至八百元。籽棉则按实际的饻分率定价（过去收棉时不以饻分率定价，而以三斤籽棉折合一斤皮棉定价，是不合理的）。在棉区籽棉市场，花纱布公司与合作社负责组织当地私营花行，代国家收购籽棉与加工。为防止私商投机，并确定了市场管理的办法：在各地市场建立交易所，组织花行在交易所中按牌价成交；对有牌照的正当商贩及农民的自用购棉，尽量予以满足。对花行的投机、囤积和私商的掺假使潮、哄抬价格等不法行为，予以彻底取缔。
    此外，该省各国营专业公司都分别制定了六、七、八三个月的物资供应计划，使棉区所需粮食、纱布、百货、煤、盐等能及时满足，并保证棉区物价稳定。为照顾棉区粮食需要，并确定棉农得以棉花抵交公粮。
