　　Labor Model Song Luoxue's Letter
    Reports That Farmers in His Village Have Begun Selling Stored Cotton
To the Editor:
    The farmers in our village who have stored cotton have now begun to sell it to the state. When the cadres, Party members, and Youth League members in our village saw the State Council's instructions on cotton purchasing and storage, they used the daily evening meetings and group meetings to discuss this important matter. Song Luotian, a member of the village's Communist Party branch, was the first to express at the meeting that he would sell all thirty-odd jin of good cotton stored in his house to the state. The discussions on this matter were even more lively at the Youth League's group meetings. Song Shuyi, deputy secretary of the Youth League branch, said: The women in our village all want to work in textile factories; if we collect cotton and don't sell it to the state, the yarn factories will have to stop work, so what work can we do? Youth League member Song Wenying is determined to sell some of the cotton stored in his home to the state. He said: We can't let our volunteers not have clothes to wear, everyone also discussed a good method to temporarily mobilize the masses: ask fourth-grade elementary school students to go door-to-door to spread the word. These days everyone is busy harvesting wheat, and it is difficult to hold mass meetings, so the elementary school students take notes to each household to spread the word. The notes say: "Selling cotton is resisting America and aiding Korea. You can store it or sell it, the price will only go up, not down." The people in Song Hongtian's family, after hearing such propaganda, are willing to sell the sixty or seventy jin of cotton stored in their home to the state. Now we are preparing to further promote and mobilize households with more stored cotton.

　　劳动模范宋洛学来信报告
    该村农民已开始出售存棉编辑同志：
    我们村里存有棉花的农民，现在已经开始向国家出售。我们村的干部、党员、青年团员看到政务院发布的关于购棉储棉工作的指示，就利用每天晚上的碰头会和小组会，分别讨论了这件大事情。本村中共支部委员宋洛田，在会上首先表示，要把他家存的三十来斤好棉花，全部卖给国家。青年团的小组会上，对这件事情讨论得更热闹。团支部副书记宋淑义说：咱们村的妇女都想到纺织厂去做工；咱们收了棉花，不卖给国家，纱厂要停工，还做什么工呢？团员宋文英决心把家里存的一部分棉花卖给国家。他说：可不能叫咱们志愿军穿不上衣服，大家还在会中讨论出临时动员群众的一个好办法：请四年级的小学生串门宣传。这几天大家忙着割麦，很难召开群众大会，就由小学生带上纸条到各家宣传，纸条上面写着：“卖棉花就是抗美援朝，要存要卖都可以，价钱听涨不听落”。宋鸿田家里的人听了这样的宣传，愿意把家里存的六七十斤棉花卖给国家。现在我们正准备进一步向存棉较多的户进行宣传动员。
