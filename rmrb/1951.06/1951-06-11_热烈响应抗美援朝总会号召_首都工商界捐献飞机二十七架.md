　　Enthusiastically Responding to the Call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association
    The Capital's Industrial and Commercial Circles Donate Twenty-Seven Airplanes
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The capital's industrial and commercial circles are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association and have decided to donate twenty-seven airplanes (one large squadron). In recent days, all sectors and households in the Beijing industrial and commercial community, under the unified leadership of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, have been actively formulating donation plans after widespread and in-depth discussions and deliberations. On the morning of the 10th, the Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee held a mobilization meeting for weapon donations at the Zhonghe Theater. More than 1,300 people attended, including representatives from various industries, representatives from suburban industrial and commercial circles, and stallholder representatives. Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee, reported on the important significance and methods of this weapon donation by the Beijing industrial and commercial community. He pointed out that this donation campaign should be combined with increased production, and donations should be made in a planned manner under the principles of developing business, improving management, streamlining, and economizing. In the future, the Beijing industrial and commercial community should do four things well: (1) organize a donation committee to lead the donation work; (2) conduct widespread publicity and mobilization, and carry out donations on the basis of conscious voluntarism; (3) each household and each person should formulate a plan for increasing production, saving, and donating; and (4) when formulating a donation plan, it is imperative to consult with both labor and management to strengthen unity and complete the task.
    Li Leguang, Secretary-General of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, spoke at the meeting. He said: In order to continue to promote the patriotic spirit shown by the capital's industrial and commercial circles in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, it is hoped that all industrialists and businessmen in the city will achieve greater and more glorious achievements in responding to the three major calls of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association this time. He also called on the city's industrial and commercial circles to launch a patriotic pact movement and do a good job of giving preferential treatment to the families of martyrs and soldiers to strengthen the fighting will of our People's Volunteer Army.
    Representatives from some industries and industrial and commercial households reported on the situation and experience of their donation mobilizations. In addition to the representative of the new pharmaceutical industry reporting that they had decided to donate one airplane, and the construction industry expressing that they had donated one airplane and one cannon, Liu Renze, Chairman of the Hardware Industry, reported that they had donated one airplane and one cannon. Xu Jinqing, Manager of Daoxiangchun Food Store in Dong'an Market, said: After consultation between labor and management, we will do our best in increasing production and saving, donate 100 million yuan, and guarantee early delivery. Tang Rongan, Manager of Rongchanghao, said: My husband and I have a small business, we will first donate 8 million yuan, and then donate according to the amount of stamp tax each month until the American imperialist aggressors are defeated. Many other industrial and commercial households also reported their donation figures. The meeting finally determined that the Beijing industrial and commercial circles would donate twenty-seven airplanes (one large squadron) and strive to overfulfill the task.
