    Do Not Misuse Colloquialisms

    To the Editor:

    Upon reading the articles in the June 6th Guangming Daily and Xinmin Evening News reporting on the Beijing People's Swimming Pool, the Beijing colloquialism "pào mógu" (泡蘑菇) was used; on the 7th, the caption of a photograph on the first page of the People's Daily, in the left-hand corner, showing children swimming happily in the People's Swimming Pool, also used this colloquialism. We have some opinions on this colloquialism.

    The Beijing saying "pào mógu" means "to act shamelessly" or "to cause trouble." Therefore, it is completely inappropriate to use it when describing children swimming happily.

    We believe that the use of colloquialisms should be selective, and that they should only be used after their meaning is fully understood, and should not be misused.

    Since three newspapers, especially the People's Daily, have used this colloquialism, we feel that this issue is all the more worthy of being raised for everyone's attention.

    Editor's Note: We did not clearly understand the meaning of the colloquialism "pào mógu," and used it very carelessly. This is an oversight in our editorial work. We will pay special attention in the future and correct this careless shortcoming.

### 不可滥用土语

    不可滥用土语编辑同志：
    见到六月六日光明日报、新民报报道北京市人民游泳场的文章中，用了“泡蘑菇”这句北京土语；七日，人民日报第一版左报角儿童们正在人民游泳场游泳的照片说明中，也用了这句土语。我们对这句土语有些意见。
    北京人说的“泡蘑菇”是“耍无赖”“捣蛋”的意思。因此，在说明儿童愉快地游泳时，完全不应该引用它。
    我们觉得使用土语应该有所选择，应该确实明白了它的意义之后再用，而不可滥用。
    既然三个报纸，特别是人民日报，引用了这句土语，我们觉得这问题就更值得提出请大家注意了。      北京市第四中学通讯广播组   
    编者按：我们没有弄清楚“泡蘑菇”这句土话的含义，很不慎重地引用了它，这是我们编辑工作上的疏忽。今后当特别注意，纠正这种粗枝大叶的缺点。
