　　June 25th on the Korean Front
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yuzhang
　　On June 25th, the first anniversary of the Korean People's Liberation War, I spent the entire day touring the front lines.
　　Although the American invading army was showering our positions with bombs and shells day and night, the Korean people were still calmly living their lives just a dozen or so miles from the front lines. Farmers were busy planting rice in the fields, women were picking mulberry leaves to feed silkworms, and self-defense队员s were patrolling the village entrances day and night with guns. The Korean people, tested by a year of battle, more deeply recognized and trusted the strength of their protectors—the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers—and they firmly believed that the People's Army and the Volunteers were capable of ultimately defeating the enemy.
　　As soon as I stepped into the forward positions of the Chinese People's Volunteers, I heard singing and laughter everywhere. The soldiers were singing: "The Volunteers are so brave! Wang Ba Lei, fighting tanks; Taking up rifles to charge; Killing the American bandits like bears." Although this was the front line, with American shells constantly exploding in front of our positions, and enemy tanks and cars crawling back and forth six or seven miles away, the Volunteer heroes all appeared calm and happy. The meritorious heroes here held a celebration meeting on this day. They excitedly recalled their glorious achievements and set out their plans for making meritorious achievements in future battles. Hero unit banners hung everywhere in the fortifications on the positions. Here was the "Mt. Zhongyuan Hero Company," there was the "Daocheng Hyun Hero Company," and over there was the "Zhang Fushan Hero Platoon"... Combat heroes and meritorious personnel, wearing the "Military Service Medal" recently awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, walked back and forth on the positions. The clear sunlight shone through the trees and onto the positions. The soldiers' faces were all beaming, and the various American weapons seized from the American invading army shone dazzlingly. Everyone and everything here demonstrated the brilliant victories achieved by the Korean and Chinese people's soldiers.
　　I especially visited the "Mt. Zhongyuan Hero Company." In February of this year, on the Han River front, this company held Mt. Zhongyuan for fourteen days and nights, killing and wounding more than eight hundred and ninety enemies. Standing on their position and looking south, ahead were rolling mountains, and the 38th parallel ran horizontally through the mountains. On this day last year, in the Gaesong area, not far from here to the west, the American invaders directed the Syngman Rhee traitorous army to begin their attack on the Korean people. A full year has passed from that time to today, and all the American invaders have gained is a significant loss of their personnel and supplies. A soldier pointed to the mountain in front and said: "I've crossed this mountain four times, and every time we crossed it, we killed and wounded tens of thousands of enemies. The first time we crossed the mountain was during the New Year Offensive, when we annihilated more than 10,000 enemies; after the Han River blocking battle, we turned back and annihilated another 60,000 or 70,000 enemies; in the two counter-attacks after April 22, we turned back and annihilated another 40,000 enemies. In the past eight months, we've charged back and forth and eliminated about 100,000 of Truman's bandit soldiers. I wonder how many more people you, Truman, will send to their deaths!" When talking about the victories of the past year, the people on the positions laughed even more heartily. Zhong Yanbao, the platoon leader of the "Ji Cheng Zhou Hero Platoon," patted the automatic rifle in his hand and said: "Last year when we went abroad to fight, we chased the American devils from the Yalu River to the Han River with just bayonets and grenades. Now, look, our company's machine gunners are using American light machine guns; there are even more American carbines and automatic rifles, and what recoilless guns and rocket launchers, all equipped by Truman for us. Let's talk about it, in the past we only heard the enemy's artillery fire, now look!" He pointed out the artillery positions to me. Those were howitzers captured from the American army on the Gunuri battlefield last November, and they were squatting in the fortifications, coldly pointing their muzzles at the enemy. There were also American anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns raising their heads to the sky. Platoon Leader Zhong said: "We're using the American cannons we captured to return the favor to the American devils!" Sun Rongchang, who was a farmer eight months ago, has now become a combat hero, wearing the "Military Service Medal" on his chest. On Height 559 on the Han River front, he once led a platoon to defend for seventeen days, killing and wounding more than two hundred and fifty enemies. He said: "In February, we defended Height 559, digging snow pits in the frozen ground, squatting inside, grabbing fried noodles when we were hungry, and eating snow when we were thirsty; when the grenades ran out, we threw stones, and even then we defeated the enemy. Today, look, the comrades are eating with rosy faces, and the ammunition is sufficient, it is truly a strong army with brave soldiers, let the American devils come with as many as they have!"
　　The Volunteer heroes greeted this anniversary with victory. At eight o'clock on the morning of the 25th, the enemy began indiscriminate shelling, and then used more than fifty tanks and cars carrying infantry to rush towards the forward positions of the Volunteers, but they were ambushed by the forward units of the Volunteers, and the tanks and cars turned around and fled. The soldiers laughed, jumped, clapped their hands, and shouted at the fleeing enemy: "Come on! I've prepared American-made iron snacks for you, why are you going back again?" A burst of laughter broke out on the positions.

　　六月二十五日在朝鲜前线
    新华社记者  王玉章
    在六月二十五日，朝鲜人民解放战争一周年的这一天，记者整天巡行前线阵地。
    虽然美国侵略军整天整夜向我军阵地倾泻着炸弹和炮弹，可是就在离前线十几里的地方，朝鲜人民仍然镇静地生活着。农民们忙着在田里插秧，女人们在采桑喂蚕，自卫队员们扛着枪日夜在村口巡逻。经过一年战斗考验的朝鲜人民，更加深刻地认识和信赖他们的保卫者——朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的力量了，他们坚信人民军和志愿军是能够最后打败敌人的。
    一踏进志愿军的前线阵地，就听见到处都是歌声和笑声。战士们唱着：“志愿军，真英勇！王八雷，打坦克；端起步枪打冲锋；直杀得美国强盗像狗熊。”这里虽然是前线，美军的炮弹不断地在阵地前沿爆炸，敌人的坦克和汽车也在阵地前六七里处往来爬行，但是志愿军勇士们却都表现安详而愉快。这里的功臣英雄们在这一天举行了庆功会。他们兴奋地回忆自己的光荣战绩，订出了自己在今后战斗中的立功计划。阵地上的工事里，到处悬挂着英雄单位的锦旗。这里是“中元山英雄连”，那边是“道城岘英雄连”，那边又是“张福山英雄排”……战斗英雄们、功臣们胸前佩戴着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在最近颁发的“军功章”，在阵地上走来走去。晴朗的阳光穿过树林，照射在阵地上。战士们个个红光满面，从美国侵略军那里缴获来的各种各样的美式武器，闪着耀眼的光芒。这里的每一个人、每一件东西都说明了朝、中人民战士所取得的辉煌胜利。
    记者特地访问了“中元山英雄连”。今年二月，在汉江前线，这个连曾在中元山上坚守十四昼夜，杀伤敌人八百九十多名。站在他们阵地上向南眺望，前面是起伏的群山，北纬三十八度线就从群山中横穿而过。去年的今天，在离这里不远的西面的开城地区，美国侵略者指挥着李承晚卖国军队开始了对朝鲜人民的进攻。从那时候到今天，已经过了整整一年了，美国侵略者所得到的只是他的兵员和物资的重大损失。一个战士指着前面的山说：“这座山我翻过四次了，我们每一次翻过它时，都杀伤了成万的敌人。第一次翻过山去是新年攻势的时候，那次我们歼敌一万多；汉江阻击战以后我们翻回来，又歼敌六、七万；四月二十二日以后的两次反击战，我们又翻过去歼敌四万多。八个月来我们来回冲杀，就把杜鲁门的强盗兵搞掉了十万左右。我看你杜鲁门还派多少人来送死！”谈起一年来的胜利时，阵地上人们哄笑得更热闹了。“纪成周英雄排”的排长钟延包拍拍手里拿着的自动步枪说：“去年咱出国作战，光凭刺刀手榴弹就追得美国鬼子从鸭绿江跑到汉江。现在呢，你看咱们连的机枪手、拿的是一色的美式轻机枪；美式卡宾枪和自动步枪更不少，还有什么无座力炮，火箭筒，这都是杜鲁门给咱装备的。再说吧，从前咱光听敌人的炮响，现在你看！”他把炮兵阵地指点给我看。那是去年十一月在军隅里战场上从美军那里缴来的榴弹炮，它们正蹲在工事里，把炮口冷冷地对着敌人。还有美式高射炮、高射机枪昂头向着天空。钟排长说：“咱们用缴获来的美国大炮来回敬美国鬼子了！”在八个月以前还是一个农民的孙荣昌，现在已成了战斗英雄，胸前戴着“军功章”。在汉江前线五五九高地上，他曾经率领一个排坚守了十七天，杀伤敌人二百五十多个。他说：“二月里我们守五五九高地，在冰冻的地上挖个雪坑坑，蹲在里头，饿了抓把炒面吃，渴了吃口雪；手榴弹打光了用石头砸，就这样我们还打败了敌人。今天，你看，同志们吃得满面红光，弹药又充足，真正是兵强马壮，美国鬼子有多少就都来吧！”
    志愿军勇士们用胜利来迎接这个周年纪念日。二十五日早晨八点钟，敌人开始了盲目的炮击，接着又用五十多辆坦克、汽车载着步兵向志愿军阵地前沿闯来，但一遭到志愿军前哨部队的伏击，坦克和汽车掉头就跑。战士们笑着，跳着，拍着手，对着逃跑的敌人喊道：“来呀！老子给你准备好了美国造的铁点心，你怎么又回去了呢？”阵地上引起了阵哄笑声。
