　　Another Scoundrel of Catholicism - Mao Zhenxiang
　　Lin Hong
    The reactionary Chinese Catholic priest, Mao Zhenxiang, in order to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang "recover" the mainland, hurriedly traveled to Europe, the Americas, and Japan. On January 30th of this year, he ran to Taiwan again. At the welcome meeting presided over by the White bandit Chongxi, Mao Zhenxiang, in addition to rehashing the old anti-communist and anti-people tune, inhumanely praised the American imperialists' war of aggression in Korea.
    Mao Zhenxiang is the general manager of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nanjing. For more than 20 years, he has been wearing a religious cloak, engaging in espionage activities against the Chinese people under the instructions of the Vatican and American imperialism; he is an accomplice of the notorious secret agent ringleader Yu Bin. From 1932, Mao Zhenxiang lived in the United States for eight years, spreading reactionary ideas among overseas Chinese under the guise of preaching, and organized the so-called "Yu Bin Society" to win over and buy off young people with unclear political understanding. In 1939, he also served as Yu Bin's general secretary. In 1947, the Vatican felt that this Chinese priest's anti-people "achievements were worthy of support," and appointed him as the director of the student service office of the "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association." The "Catholic Cultural Advancement Association" had close relations with the CC clique secret agents of the Kuomintang bandit gang, and the president was Yu Bin. Thus, Mao Zhenxiang assumed a major mission: under the guise of recommending Chinese students, he selected young students to go to the United States for espionage training. In the short three years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Mao Zhenxiang personally sent more than 600 "students" to the United States. The truth of this sinful activity is not easily detected by ordinary people; but the heads of many Catholic universities in the United States once said to Mao Zhenxiang: "Father, thank you, the students you send us are all propagandists for the country (should be read as the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group), and also anti-communist 'fresh troops'."
    In January 1948, the victorious development of the Chinese People's Liberation War had made Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule precarious. Mao Zhenxiang hurriedly ran to the United States again, and successively gave speeches in 52 major cities and 125 universities including Washington, New York, and Chicago, slandering the Chinese people, actively appealing for "American aid" for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and openly advocated that the United States should participate in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's anti-people civil war with military action. After returning to China, Mao Zhenxiang, under Yu Bin's instructions, helped the American rogue Chennault organize the so-called "Air Force Volunteer Army." In March 1949, after Mao Zhenxiang was driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people, he ran to the United States again and openly called on retired American Air Force personnel to join the "Air Force Volunteer Army" to assist the Chiang bandit gang in bombing the liberated areas, causing damage to the lives and property of peaceful residents in Shanghai and other places, and owing the Chinese people an unforgettable blood debt.
    Although Mao Zhenxiang was so "enthusiastically" loyal to the American Chiang bandit gang, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule was finally overthrown by the people, and American imperialism was also driven out of mainland China. However, Mao Zhenxiang did not give up because of this, and has been actively active abroad for several years, attempting to help Chiang Kai-shek "recover" the mainland. Two years ago, he ran to Europe and personally met with the Spanish dictator Franco, conspiring to restore "diplomatic relations" between Spain and the Chiang bandit gang. Franco has expressed his willingness to accept Mao Zhenxiang's request. According to the Kuomintang's reactionary bi-monthly magazine "Tomorrow" published in Taipei, Mao Zhenxiang's task of running back to Taiwan from the United States via Tokyo recently is to "do more work reporting on the 'new life' situation in Taiwan" to his American masters, and he has been hired as a "writer" stationed in Taiwan by the United Press, a joint venture of 230 Catholic weeklies in the United States. In fact, this is to engage in espionage work of collecting information on New China for American imperialism. Today, the Catholic Three-Self Reform Movement has been launched. Patriotic believers should boldly expose the ugly crimes of Catholic scoundrels like Mao Zhenxiang, and resolutely remove them from the church.

　　天主教的又一败类——毛振翔
　　林洪
    反动的中国天主教神父毛振翔，为了帮助蒋介石匪帮“收复”大陆，急急忙忙在欧洲、美洲和日本等地奔走，今年一月三十日又跑到了台湾。在白匪崇禧所主持的欢迎会上，毛振翔除了重弹反共反人民的老调外，竟毫无人性地称赞美帝国主义在朝鲜进行的侵略战争。
    毛振翔是天主教南京总主教公署总经理。二十多年来，他一直披着宗教外衣，在梵蒂冈教廷和美帝国主义的指使下，从事反对中国人民的间谍工作；是臭名远扬的特务头子于斌的帮凶。从一九三二年起，毛振翔在美国住了八年，借传教为名，在华侨中散播反动思想，并组织所谓“于斌社”，拉拢和收买政治认识不清楚的青年。一九三九年，他又担任了于斌的总秘书。一九四七年，罗马教廷觉得这个中国神父反人民的“成就值得加以支持”，委任他为“天主教文化协进会”留学生服务处处长。“天主教文化协进会”和国民党匪帮的ＣＣ系特务有密切关系，会长就是于斌。于是，毛振翔便担负了一项重大使命：借保送中国留学生为名，选派青年学生到美国受特务训练。在抗日战争胜利后的短短三年中，经由毛振翔亲手送到美国去的“留学生”达六百多人。这一罪恶活动的真象，一般人是不容易察觉的；但美国许多天主教大学的负责人曾当面向毛振翔说过：“神父，谢谢你，你给我们送来的学生都是国家（应读为蒋介石反动集团）的宣传员，也是反共的‘生力军’。”
    一九四八年一月，中国人民解放战争的胜利发展，已使蒋介石的反动统治摇摇欲坠，毛振翔又急忙跑到美国，先后在华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥等五十二个大城市和一百二十五个大学发表了污辱中国人民的演说，积极为蒋介石匪帮呼吁“美援”，并公开主张美国应以军事行动参与蒋介石匪帮的反人民内战。回国以后，毛振翔便在于斌的指使下，帮助美国流氓头子陈纳德组织所谓“空军志愿军”。一九四九年三月，毛振翔被中国人民赶出中国大陆以后，他又跑到美国，公开号召美国空军退伍人员参加“空军志愿军”，协助蒋匪帮轰炸解放区，使上海等地和平居民的生命财产遭到损失，欠下了中国人民一笔不能忘记的血债。
    虽然，毛振翔是那样“热诚”地效忠于美蒋匪帮，但国民党的反动统治终于被人民推翻了，美帝国主义也被赶出了中国大陆。不过，毛振翔并不因此死心，几年来始终在国外积极活动，企图帮助蒋介石“收复”大陆。两年前他跑到了欧洲，亲自拜见了西班牙的独裁者佛朗哥，阴谋使西班牙和蒋匪帮恢复“邦交”。佛朗哥已表示愿意接受毛振翔的请求。最近毛振翔从美国经东京跑回台湾的任务，据台北市出版的国民党的反动半月刊《明天》所载，是打算向他的美国主子“多做点报导台湾‘新生’实况的工作”，并被聘为美国二百三十家天主教周刊联合社驻台“撰述员”。实际上，这就是为美帝国主义作收集新中国情报的特务间谍工作。今天天主教的三自革新运动已发动起来了，爱国的教徒应大胆地揭露像毛振翔这样的天主教败类的丑恶罪行，并坚决把他们从教会中清除出去。
