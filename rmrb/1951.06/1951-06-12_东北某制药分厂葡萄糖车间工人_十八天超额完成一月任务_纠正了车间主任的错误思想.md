　　Eighteen days overfulfilled one month task
    Corrected the workshop director's erroneous thinking
    Workers in the glucose workshop of a pharmaceutical factory in Northeast China, after a series of education on current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, have seen an unprecedented increase in their production enthusiasm. Their overfulfillment of the production task under difficult circumstances has corrected the erroneous thinking of the workshop's management and technical personnel who did not attach importance to education on current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

    Since the launch of the patriotic labor emulation drive last winter, the Communist Party branch has led propagandists to carry out a series of education campaigns on current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea among the workers. The workers' enthusiasm for learning was high. During production breaks, they gathered in small groups to discuss current events. Even some older workers who had never paid attention to current events in the past actively participated in reading the newspaper. However, the workshop director and technicians were worried that the workers would neglect the study of production technology issues, and therefore did not approve of the workers' study of current events.

    In early March, a major problem occurred in the workshop: due to the pharmaceutical factory's delay of eighteen days in delivering the main raw material used by the workshop to manufacture glucose in February, more than 30% of the production tasks for March would be difficult to complete (because most of the finished products in March needed to be started in February). At this time, propagandists Lu Tingzhang, Ma Yuqing, and others quickly launched propaganda and mobilization among the workers, encouraging everyone to find ways to overcome this difficulty. The workers believed that if they could not overcome difficulties and complete the task in the patriotic labor emulation drive, it would be a very disgraceful thing. After discussion and research, the workers came up with a solution: to make greater use of the original equipment capacity in each section of the glucose manufacturing process, that is, to process 25% more "work in progress" than usual. This would make up for three-quarters of the total shortage by the end of March; the remaining one-quarter of the shortage would be made up by the workers voluntarily giving up two Sundays of rest time. Therefore, everyone jointly signed a guarantee and suggested that the workshop director adopt this method. Unexpectedly, the workshop director failed to see the fact that the workers' production enthusiasm had greatly increased after the education on current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and believed that such a large shortage could not be made up, so he refused to accept the workers' proposal. The workers then requested that this proposal be submitted to the administrative leaders at the branch factory and general factory levels for consideration, and finally obtained the approval of the general factory. The general factory first affirmed that the production task should be completed, and at the same time, required the workshop director to fully recognize the new factor that the workers' production enthusiasm had been enhanced through the education on current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. At this point, the workshop director and technicians began to accept the workers' proposal and immediately formulated a more scientific implementation plan and put it into practice. As a result, the March production task was overfulfilled by 3% in eighteen days, and the quality was fully up to standard.

    After the March task was completed, the workshop director and technical personnel deeply experienced the importance of education on current events related to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and therefore actively supported the workers' study of current events. In April, the workshop overfulfilled the production task by another 3.2%. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　东北某制药分厂葡萄糖车间工人
　  十八天超额完成一月任务
    纠正了车间主任的错误思想
    东北某制药分厂葡萄糖车间工人经过了一系列的抗美援朝时事教育，生产积极性空前提高，在困难情况下超额完成生产任务，这一事实纠正了该车间管理人员和技术人员不重视抗美援朝时事教育的错误思想。
    该车间自去冬开展爱国主义劳动竞赛后，共产党支部即领导宣传员向工人们进行了一系列的抗美援朝时事教育。工人们学习情绪高涨，每当生产间隙，就三三两两地聚在一块讨论时事，连过去从不关心时事的某些老工人，也都积极参加读报。但车间主任和技术员当时却顾虑工人们将会因此忽视生产技术问题的研究，因而对工人们的时事学习不表赞同。
    三月初，该车间发生了一个大问题：由于制药总厂在二月间对该车间制造葡萄糖用的主要材料迟发了十八天，三月份百分之三十以上的生产任务将难于完成（因三月份绝大部分成品需在二月间下料）。这时，宣传员吕庭章、马玉清等便迅速在工人中展开宣传鼓动，鼓励大家想办法克服这一困难。工人们都认为在爱国主义劳动竞赛中如果不能克服困难完成任务，就是一件很不光荣的事情。经过讨论研究，工人们提出了一个办法：就是要在制造葡萄糖的各个工段中多发挥原有的设备能力，即比平常生产时多处理“在制品”百分之二十五，这样至三月底即可弥补总缺额的四分之三；其余的四分之一缺额，工人们自愿放弃两个星期天的休息时间，加工补足。于是大家联名签具了保证书，建议车间主任采用这一办法。不料车间主任却看不到抗美援朝时事教育后工人们生产积极性大为提高的事实，认为这样大的缺额是无法弥补的，拒绝接受工人们的建议。工人们又要求将这个建议提到分厂一级和总厂一级的行政负责人那里考虑，终于获得总厂的批准。总厂首先肯定生产任务应该完成，同时要求车间主任应充分认识工人们在抗美援朝时事教育中提高了生产积极性这一新的因素。至此，车间主任和技术员始接受工人建议，并立即制订了更科学的实施计划付诸实施。结果在十八天内即超额百分之三完成了三月份的生产任务，质量也完全合乎标准。
    三月份任务完成后，该车间主任和技术人员深刻体验到抗美援朝时事教育的重要，因而积极支持工人们的时事学习。四月份，该车间即又超额百分之三点二完成了生产任务。（新华社）
