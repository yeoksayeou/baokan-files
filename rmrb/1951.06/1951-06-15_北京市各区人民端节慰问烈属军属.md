　　Beijing Districts Comfort Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel during the Dragon Boat Festival

    [Our Newspaper's Report] During the Dragon Boat Festival, district public offices and people from all walks of life in Beijing warmly comforted the families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled veterans throughout the city. Each district, composed of military family representatives, civil affairs cadres from local police stations, representatives from the district people's representative conferences, and district public office staff, formed comfort groups based on police station jurisdictions. They cordially visited the families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled veterans, delivering gifts such as zongzi (rice dumplings) to each household. In the Fifth District, over three thousand teachers and students from various elementary schools participated in the district's comforting activities. They paraded through the streets and alleys with waist drum teams, with elementary school students presenting large red flowers inscribed with "Glory to Military Families," and Young Pioneers warmly saluting the families of martyrs and military personnel. In the Third District, due to the higher profits generated by the military family factories, a portion of the earnings was proposed to be used to give two jin (one kilogram) of meat to each family of martyrs and disabled veterans. In the First District, many zongzi vendors, upon learning that the district public office was buying zongzi to comfort military families, immediately reduced their prices, selling zongzi that originally cost two hundred yuan for only one hundred and sixty yuan. They said: "We are not making any profit from sales to military families."

    Several districts and many police stations held get-togethers to entertain military families. The Eighth District, organized by police station jurisdictions, jointly with the local garrisons, government offices, factories, and citizens, held sixteen army-support and family-cherishing soirees. The First and Ninth Districts held district-wide military family celebrations.

    The families of martyrs, military personnel, and disabled veterans felt honored by the government's and citizens' concern and comfort and expressed their deep gratitude for everyone's enthusiasm.

　　北京市各区人民端节慰问烈属军属
    【本报讯】北京市各区公所和各界人民在端午节热烈地慰问了全市烈属、军属和荣誉军人，各区由军属代表、派出所民政干事、区人民代表会议代表、区公所工作人员，以派出所为单位组成慰问小组，亲切地慰问烈属、军属、荣誉军人，并挨户赠送粽子等礼物。第五区各小学校师生三千余人参加该区慰问，携带腰鼓队穿街过巷，由小学生献“军属光荣”的大红花，少年儿童队热烈向烈属、军属致敬。第三区由于军属工厂生产收益较多，提出一部分盈利，给每一户烈属、荣誉军人赠送肉二斤。第一区很多卖粽子商人，知道区公所买粽子慰问军属时，即自动减价，二百元一个的粽子只卖一百六十元，他们说：卖给军属，不赚一个钱。
    好几个区和很多派出所举行了招待军属的联欢会。第八区以派出所为单位，联合管界内驻军、机关、工厂、市民分别召开了十六个拥军优属同乐晚会。第一第九等区则举行了全区军属联欢会。
    烈属军属残废军人为政府和市民群众对他们的关心慰问感到光荣，并对大家的热情深表感谢。
