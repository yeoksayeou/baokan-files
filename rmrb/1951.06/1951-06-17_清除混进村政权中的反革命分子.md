Eliminating Counter-Revolutionary Elements Mixed into Village Political Power
Editor:
	Caoqiao Township in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, is very remote and suffered severely from banditry in the past. Last winter, when land reform was implemented, the work of mobilizing the masses was not thorough enough, and the membership of the farmers' association was impure. Out of the 120 village cadres in the township, 37 were landlords, rich peasants, bandit squadron leaders, and former Baojia personnel. Xu Zirong, the director of the seventh village farmers' association, had served as a township soldier for seven years and had three cases of murder on his hands. The militia captain of the fourth village was a former Bao team deputy who had also killed three people. During the land reform, the peasants struggled against the local tyrant landlord Gao Shijun, but he was not overthrown at that time. Originally, 18 people were prepared to make accusations, but only eight showed up at the meeting. Gao Shijun stood tall on the stage, his eyes darting around the audience, scaring the victims into silence. Before the meeting was even adjourned, Gao Shijun left on his own accord. The feudal forces were not completely overthrown, and they spread rumors everywhere, causing low morale among the masses in production. When village cadres wanted to call a meeting of the masses, it was always impossible to convene. When the weather was fine, they said they were too busy; when it rained, they said they had no umbrellas or overshoes; when it was nighttime, they said they had no flashlights.

	After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began, through the propaganda and mobilization of the work team, the peasants actively participated in the accusations and denunciations of counter-revolutionaries. The People's Court sentenced the heinous local tyrant landlord Gao Shijun, counter-revolutionary Xu Zirong, and eight others to death by firing squad. Following this, 27 landlords, bandits, and special agents were purged from the village cadres, and 40 activists were promoted to be village cadres. The number of farmers' association members has increased to 2,782, and a militia team of 443 people has been organized.

	After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the righteous spirit in Caoqiao Township rose, and the production morale of the masses changed from stable to high. Everyone is setting production plans. In the movement to build water conservancy projects and eliminate pests, 110 production activists have emerged in the township. Now, a vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea is sweeping the entire township.

    清除混进村政权中的反革命分子编辑同志：
    浙江省嘉兴县曹桥乡很偏僻，过去匪患很严重。去年冬天实行土地改革时，发动群众的工作做得很不彻底，农民协会会员成份不纯。全乡一百二十个乡村干部中，有地主、富农分子、土匪中队长及伪保甲人员共三十七人。第七村农民协会主任徐子荣，当过七年乡丁，有人命血案三件。第四村民兵队长是伪保队附，也杀过三个人。土地改革时，农民曾斗争恶霸地主高士俊，但是当时并没有斗倒了他。原来有十八个人准备诉苦，开会时只到了八个。高士俊高高站在台上，两只眼向台下转来转去，吓得苦主们不敢说话。还没有宣布散会，高士俊就自动走了。封建势力没有被彻底推倒，他们到处散布谣言，群众生产情绪低落。乡村干部要召集群众开会，总是开不起来。天晴开会说太忙，下雨开会说没伞没套鞋，晚上开会说没电筒。
    镇压反革命开始后，经过工作组的宣传发动，农民们都积极参加了对反革命的控诉与检举，人民法庭将罪大恶极的恶霸地主高士俊，反革命分子徐子荣等十人执行枪决。接着就在乡村干部中洗刷了地主、土匪特务分子二十七人，提拔了四十个积极分子为乡村干部。农民协会会员已发展到二千七百八十二人；并组织了四百四十三个人的民兵队。
    经过镇压反革命，曹桥乡正气上升，群众生产情绪由稳定走到高涨，大家都订出生产计划。在兴修水利和灭除害虫运动中，全乡出现生产积极分子一百一十人。现在全乡正掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝爱国运动。
