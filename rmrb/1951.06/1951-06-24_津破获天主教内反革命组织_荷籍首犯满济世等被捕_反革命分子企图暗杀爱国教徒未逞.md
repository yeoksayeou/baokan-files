[Reported by this newspaper] The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau recently uncovered a counter-revolutionary secret alliance led by Hendrik MalieHermens, a Dutch Catholic priest. This organization gathered key members of the "Our Lady's Service Group," a reactionary organization cultivated long-term by MalieHermens and another Dutch priest, Zheng Huamin (who has been expelled from the country by the People's Government). They specialized in using terrorist means to disrupt social order and endanger patriotic Catholics. The organization sent out thirteen threatening letters and twice gathered gangsters and thugs in an attempt to beat patriotic Catholics who were actively carrying out the Catholic reform movement. After completing the step of throwing sharp knives to intimidate patriotic Catholics, they planned to assassinate the leaders of the Tianjin Catholic Reform Movement Promotion Association. After detecting the conspiracy of MalieHermens and others, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau smashed the organization on the eve of the criminals' planned knife throwing. The criminals MalieHermens, Wang Keming, Li Xuwu, Zhang Zicheng and other four persons have been arrested successively by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, and the original drafts of the threatening letters sent by the criminals and three sharp knives and other evidence have been seized.

Since coming to Tianjin in 1946, MalieHermens has consistently been hostile to the Chinese people. When he served as the director of affairs at the Catholic church school Xikai Middle School, he and the school principal, Wang Jiwu (who has been arrested by the People's Government and is a member of the Catholic reactionary organization "Catholic Youth Patriotic Corps"), jointly dismantled and concealed a secret radio station originally stored in the school. He also extensively developed the reactionary organization "Our Lady's Service Group" and led the reactionary organization "St. Augustine Catechism Research Class" to systematically spread anti-government and anti-people remarks, undermining the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. On May 12 this year, Wang Keming and Li Xuwu and others formed an alliance after drinking blood wine and swearing an oath in MalieHermens' room in the Xiaobailou Catholic Church, electing MalieHermens as their leader. After the secret organization was established, MalieHermens took out a total of 230,000 yuan in activity funds on three occasions. Under the instructions of MalieHermens, Wang and others held secret meetings more than ten times and actively carried out sabotage activities. First, on May 17 and 18, they sent thirteen anonymous letters, threatening patriotic Catholics and priests in Tianjin. On May 31, according to the plan, Wang and others further purchased sharp knives, preparing for Li and others to deliver them separately to three locations the next day. However, that night, Wang, Li, and Zhang were arrested by the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. After preliminary interrogation, the criminals, due to conclusive evidence, have confessed to the above crimes.

The criminal Wang Keming is a professional secret agent who once served as a detective in the French Concession Public Works Bureau. During the Japanese occupation of Tianjin, he served as a detective and intelligence officer in the puppet police bureau. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he also served as a criminal team member in the bandit police bureau, specializing in collecting information about the Communist Party and arresting Communist Party members. After liberation, he concealed his history and refused to register. The criminal Li Xuwu was a member of the Sanqing Corps and served as the vice president of the fourth district of the "Our Lady's Service Group." The criminal Zhang Zicheng was an officer in the bandit Wang Yaowu's army. The three criminals all have committed crimes in the past.

In order to protect the safety of the people, maintain social order, and guarantee the people's freedom of religious belief, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau will file a public prosecution in accordance with the law after the interrogation is completed, and request the government to impose appropriate punishments on the criminals according to the severity of their crimes in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries.

　　津破获天主教内反革命组织
    荷籍首犯满济世等被捕
    反革命分子企图暗杀爱国教徒未逞
    【本报讯】天津市人民政府公安局日前破获了以天主教荷兰籍神甫满济世（Hendrik MalieHermens）为首的反革命秘密结盟。该组织纠集了由满济世及另一荷兰籍神甫郑化民（已被人民政府驱逐出境）长期培养的反动组织“圣母御侍团”骨干分子，专以恐怖手段来破坏社会治安，危害爱国天主教徒。该组织曾发出十三封恐吓信及两次邀集流氓地痞，企图殴打积极进行天主教革新运动的爱国教徒，并计划在投掷尖刀恐吓爱国天主教徒的步骤完成之后，暗杀天津市天主教革新运动促进会的领导人。天津市公安局在侦悉满济世等犯的阴谋活动后，于该犯等准备投刀的前夜，将该组织破获。案犯满济世及王克明、李绪武、张子成等四人，已先后被天津市公安局逮捕，并搜出各犯所发恐吓信的原稿及三把尖刀等证物。
    满济世自一九四六年来天津，一贯与中国人民为敌。在其任天主教教会学校西开中学事务主任时，曾与该校校长王际五（已被人民政府逮捕，为天主教反动组织“公教青年报国团”之一员）共同将原藏于校内的秘密电台拆卸后隐匿。并大量发展反动组织“圣母御侍团”及领导反动组织“圣奥斯定要理研究班”有计划地散布反政府，反人民的言论，破坏抗美援朝运动。今年五月十二日，王犯克明及李犯绪武等在小白楼天主堂满济世的房内，饮血酒宣誓后结盟，推举满济世为盟主。秘密组织成立后，满济世曾三次拿出活动经费共二十三万元。王犯等在满济世的指示下，秘密集会十余次，积极进行破坏活动。首先于五月十七、十八两日寄出匿名信十三封，恐吓天津市爱国天主教徒及神甫。王犯等于五月三十一日，按照计划，又进一步购买尖刀，准备次日由李犯等分别在三处投送。但当晚王、李、张三犯即被天津市公安局逮捕。各犯经初步侦讯后，因证据确凿，对上述罪行均已供认不讳。
    王犯克明是一职业特务，曾充当法租界工部局探员，日寇侵占天津时期充当伪警察局侦缉士、情报员，国民党反动统治时期，又任匪警察局刑事队员，专门搜集共产党情报及逮捕共产党员。解放后隐瞒历史，拒不登记。李犯绪武是三青团员，并任“圣母御侍团”第四区会副会长。张犯子成是匪王耀武部军官。三犯在历史上均有罪行。
    天津市公安局为保障人民安全，维持社会秩序及保障人民宗教信仰的自由，将于侦讯完毕后，依法提起公诉，提请政府根据中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例，分别各犯罪恶轻重，予以应得惩处。
