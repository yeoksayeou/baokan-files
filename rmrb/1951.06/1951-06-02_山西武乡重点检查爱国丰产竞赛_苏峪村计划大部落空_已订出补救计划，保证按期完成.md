　　Shanxi Wuxiang Focuses on Inspecting Patriotic Production Increase Competition
    Suyucun's Plan Largely Failed
    Remedial Plan Devised to Ensure Completion on Schedule
    Before the spring plowing and sowing, the first district of Wuxiang County, Shanxi, inspected the preparatory work of Suyucun in the production competition movement and found that the village's production competition plan had largely failed. On April 24, the district summoned 37 leading cadres, labor models, women representatives, and members of the evaluation committee from six villages including Maoshujiao, Baifantou, and Hongshui, to inspect Suyucun, which had challenged the entire district. The inspection method was: going to the fields to see and visiting farmers' households. The inspection result was: most of the village's sowing preparations were not completed according to the original plan. Of the 105 households in the village, only 28 had applied manure according to the plan; at the time of inspection, the village still had 1,380 dan of manure that had not been delivered to the fields. Work such as repairing land, exchanging seeds, weeding wheat, and building embankments were far from the plan. The inspection also found that there were many problems in Suyucun's work of substituting for cultivation, mutual assistance, and improving technology. For example, the family of revolutionary soldier Du Cunbao had not delivered manure to the field by late April; Zhu Xianlai's mutual aid group was a mere formality, only concerned with doing business, and often did not help each other in agricultural production; Han Tiancai's soil improvement was digging holes locally to take soil, putting raw soil in the fields, which not only would not grow good crops but also affect the growth of crops.
    After the inspection, a discussion was held to exchange experiences. The representatives pointed out the shortcomings and advantages they saw one by one, helping Suyucun to improve its work. The secretary of the CCP branch and the village head of Suyucun also made inspections and analyses of the village's failure to complete the plan. They said that this was because: first, the education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea was not carried out in depth, and the reading group, blackboard newspaper, and broadcasting tube did not play a role. Therefore, the farmers did not truly realize what benefits the production competition had for the country and themselves, so the enthusiasm for the competition was not great. Second, the leadership cadres' leadership of the competition was blind, only having a large plan, without specific arrangements and inspections; third, the cadres did not have specific divisions of labor and responsibilities, relying on each other, and no one seriously did the actual work. Fourth, a typical mutual aid group was not cultivated to promote the general through the typical. The representatives of the villages who participated in the inspection accepted the experience and lessons of Suyucun at the discussion, and all said: we must also conduct a major inspection when we return to the village.
    After clarifying the shortcomings of the village's work and leadership, Suyucun proposed to "immediately whip the horse and catch up" and formulated a remedial plan. The cadres specifically divided the leadership. The village lacked 2,610 dan of fertilizer, and methods for making it up were determined. Plowing, repairing embankments, weeding wheat, adjusting soil, and other farm work were all specifically divided according to different labor and animal power. At the same time, it was decided to rectify mutual aid organizations, and the village head and the propaganda committee member of the CCP branch were responsible for leading Hao Liuchang's group, cultivating the group to become a model. Other cadres also joined various mutual aid groups to comprehensively promote mutual aid work. More importantly, patriotic propaganda and education work on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea was carried out every noon and evening to raise the awareness of the masses. Suyucun's work began to have new changes.

　　山西武乡重点检查爱国丰产竞赛
    苏峪村计划大部落空
    已订出补救计划，保证按期完成
    山西武乡县一区在春耕播种前检查苏峪村在生产竞赛运动中进行备耕工作的情况，发现该村的生产竞赛计划大部落空。四月二十四日，该区召集茂树埆、白反头、洪水等六村的领导干部、劳动模范、妇女代表及评判委员会的委员等共三十七人，到向全区挑战的苏峪村进行检查。检查的方法是：一面到地里去看，一面到各农户进行访问。检查结果是：该村的播种准备工作大都没按照原计划完成。全村一百零五户，按计划上粪的只有二十八户；检查时全村还有一千三百八十担粪没有送到地里。修地、调换种籽、锄麦、垒埝等工作都离计划很远。在检查中并发现苏峪村的代耕、互助、改进技术等工作中存在不少问题。如：革命军人家属杜存保的粪到四月下旬还没送到地里；朱先来互助组是个空架子，只顾做买卖，农业生产常不互助；韩天才调剂土壤是从本地挖洞取土，把生土上在地里，这样，不仅不能长好庄稼，还要影响作物的生长。
    检查以后，举行了座谈会交流经验。代表们把看到的缺点和好处一一指出来，帮助苏峪村改进工作。苏峪村中共党支部书记和村长对本村没有完成计划，也作了检查和分析。他们说，这是因为：第一，抗美援朝教育没有深入进行，读报组、黑板报、广播筒都没有起作用。因此，农民们没有真正认识到生产竞赛对国家对自己有什么好处，所以竞赛的劲头不大。第二，领导干部对竞赛的领导是盲目的，只有个大计划，没有具体安排和检查；第三，干部们没有具体分工负责，互相依赖，实际工作没人认真去做。第四，没有培养起一个典型互助组，通过典型推动一般。参加检查的各村代表在座谈会上接受了苏峪村的经验教训，都说：回村去也得来一次大检查。
    苏峪村明确了本村工作和领导的缺点后，提出要“马上加鞭迎头赶上”，并订出补救计划。干部们具体分工领导。全村缺少两千六百一十担肥，确定了补足的办法。犁地、修垒边、埝、锄麦、调剂土壤等农活，都按不同劳畜力实行具体分工。同时，决定整顿互助组织，村长和中共党支部宣传委员负责领导郝六昌组，培养该组成为典型。其他干部也都加入各互助组，全面推动互助工作。更重要的是，每天中午和晚上做抗美援朝的爱国宣传教育工作，以提高群众的觉悟。苏峪村的工作开始有了新的转变。
