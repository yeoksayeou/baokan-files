Editorial: Vigorously Develop Rural Financial Work

    The People's Bank of China recently convened a national rural financial conference, deciding that the work of state banks at the provincial and county levels should be oriented towards the countryside. The banks should use their main strength to carry out rural financial work, helping farmers solve funding difficulties in all aspects and promote agricultural production. This is a major event concerning the nation's 400 million farmers and the agricultural economy, which accounts for 90 percent of the national economy.
    Judging from the current situation across the country, vigorously developing rural financial work has become a very urgent issue. First, the vast number of farmers, liberated from the heavy exploitation of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudal forces, and having experienced a bumper harvest last year, now hold a large quantity of agricultural products and native and special products. With the exception of a few cash crops, they are generally eager to sell them and purchase means of production and consumer goods. Therefore, supporting trade and cooperative departments, helping private merchants to make purchases, and helping the transportation industry organize transportation, so that farmers can turn their products into funds, has become a heavy responsibility that the state banks and their local organizations must undertake. To shoulder this heavy responsibility, the banking system must go deep into the countryside, understand the specific demands of farmers, and understand the various specific problems in selling native products.
    Second, due to the bumper harvest of agricultural products, the exchange of certain native products is gradually becoming more active. Farmers in newly liberated areas have gained considerable economic benefits from land reform or rent reduction and deposit refunds. A significant portion of farmers have already transitioned from being in deficit to having a surplus. The conditions for carrying out savings and insurance businesses in the vast countryside have emerged. If these businesses can be carried out in a timely manner, we can accumulate the dispersed funds of farmers into a powerful force, concentrate them for use in developing production, or help farming households experiencing difficulties due to unexpected disasters, illnesses, deaths, and other reasons. More than 200 rural financial teams in Chahar Province, in just over a month of activity in March and April, absorbed more than 4.5 billion yuan in deposits, exceeding the total amount of private savings in the entire province at the end of last year by nearly 2.5 billion yuan, or 80 percent. According to statistics from the Southern Sichuan Branch at the end of February, the total amount of private savings in the entire region had reached 183 percent of the region's deposit target for the first quarter (ending March). According to statistics from the Renshou Sub-branch in the region, 98 percent of private savings are farmer deposits. A survey of 24 ordinary households in four villages, including Guanzhuang in the cotton-producing area of Nangong, Hebei, showed that the average net surplus per person, comparing last year's income and expenses, was equivalent to 258 kilograms of rice. If savings business is not developed, these funds will be tied up in the hands of farmers and cannot be circulated.
    Third, the liberated farmers are eager to develop production in all aspects. They demand to open canals, dig wells, increase fertilizer, buy waterwheels, buy good livestock, and even new large-scale farm implements. They demand to improve production technology, improve management, and increase yield per unit area. However, simply concentrating their surplus is not enough to satisfy these many desires. State banks are still needed to provide assistance in the form of special agricultural loans or revolving short-term loans. The vast handicraft industries, workshops, and transportation and marketing businesses needed by farmers also frequently require revolving loans. Providing them with some assistance is also entirely necessary.
    Fourth, China's countryside is so vast that banking institutions alone cannot meet the farmers' frequent and numerous demands for capital adjustments. This requires carrying out credit cooperation and mutual aid activities with farmers' own funds in the countryside, and establishing various credit organizations, large and small, such as credit cooperatives, credit departments, mutual fund groups, and loan referral offices, and developing free lending. These credit organizations must also be given business guidance and financial support.
    In short, the new situation in the countryside requires the state banking system to deeply and comprehensively carry out rural financial business. In the past, financial activities were confined to the vicinity of county towns, limited to seasonal agricultural loans and simple supply of funds. This is far from being able to adapt to the current needs. In order to shoulder this new historical task, this rural financial conference decided to push banking institutions one level further down from the county level, select larger market towns (especially market towns in special product areas) to establish business offices, or organize mobile rural financial work teams to go deep into the countryside to carry out business. This is an important organizational guarantee, and all localities must make every effort to implement it. Some bank cadres believe that carrying out business in the countryside "requires a lot of effort, has little effect, involves great risks, and is troublesome," and therefore hold a hesitant attitude. This is because they have not recognized the great significance of this work politically and should be given in-depth education to thoroughly correct this.
    The conference has made many specific regulations regarding the specific issues in carrying out rural financial work. Among them, the following issues are particularly noteworthy.
    First, each region should, under the general guidelines, determine what its current main priorities should be, based on local conditions and the needs of the masses. For example, ethnic minority areas should focus on helping to sell native and special products. Areas in North China and Central South China where native and special products have basically been sold should vigorously develop savings and insurance. Many other areas should advance on multiple fronts simultaneously. Disaster areas should focus on capital supply (loans) and promoting production, while bumper harvest areas should focus on capital adjustment. Some areas should give equal stress on supply and adjustment. These all need to be determined according to local conditions and the most urgent demands of the masses, and cannot be mechanically or egalitarianistically prescribed.
    Second, the acceptability and special needs of farmers should be taken into account. For example, to promote savings, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that some farmers are unwilling to expose their wealth and are afraid of the impact of prices. More facts should be used to educate farmers, persuade them of the reasons, and eliminate their concerns. At the same time, more patriotic prize-linked savings and fixed-term, fixed-amount deposits with guaranteed real value and principal should be offered. For example, cotton-based real value savings can be promoted to help state-owned trade obtain cotton and at the same time dispel cotton farmers' concerns. Alternatively, according to the wishes of farmers, savings linked to loans for well-digging, canal-opening, and livestock purchase can be offered in the form of zero-deposit lump-sum payment. If some farmers require real deposits, necessary consideration can also be given (but this must be done in consultation with the trade and cooperative departments to find a good sales channel before accepting). In order to understand the specific demands and difficulties of farmers, household visits should be conducted in depth after arriving in the village to solicit their opinions. It is necessary to prevent commanding from above without understanding the situation, which may cause dissatisfaction among the masses.
    Third, close contact and cooperation with relevant departments should be paid attention to, and every possible force should be striven for to assist the work. For example, in helping to sell native and special products, contact should be made with trade, cooperation and other specialized departments; when issuing loans, they should be combined with specialized business organizations such as agricultural and forestry, water conservancy, and seed companies. Frequent contact with the vast number of district and village cadres is even more necessary to obtain their assistance. To obtain the assistance of district and village cadres, cadres of the banking system need to actively cooperate with the central work. Some financial teams in Chahar cooperated with district and village cadres in publicizing resistance to America and aid to Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and helped with some specific work in the bumper harvest movement. As a result, they gained assistance from all parties and quickly carried out their own work. This experience is worth learning from. In addition, entrusting post offices, cooperatives, trade teams, etc. as agency organizations, and hiring district and village cadres, primary school teachers, credit officers, etc. as agents are all necessary in the event of insufficient bank cadres.
    Many parts of rural financial work are still in the initial stage, and cadres and the masses are not familiar with them. Party and government leading organs in all localities, especially the financial and economic committees at all levels, must recognize that rural financial work is a major political task related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, vigorously strengthen leadership, help overcome difficulties, organize the forces of all parties to cooperate, assist, and support it, so that the resolutions of this conference can be smoothly implemented.

### 大力开展农村金融工作

　　大力开展农村金融工作
    中国人民银行最近召开全国农村金融会议，决定国家银行省、县工作应该面向农村，应以主要力量开展农村金融工作，帮助农民从各方面解决资金困难，推进农业生产。这是关系着全国四亿农民和占国民经济百分之九十的农业经济的大事。
    从目前全国的情况看，大力开展农村金融工作已经成为十分迫切的问题。第一、从帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建势力重重压榨之下解放了的广大农民，经过去年丰收，现在手里掌握了大量的农产品和土产、特产，少数经济作物除外，一般迫切地要求推销出去，购买生产资料和生活资料。所以，支持贸易、合作部门和帮助私商进行收购，帮助运输行业组织运输，使农民把生产品变成资金，成了国家银行及其地方组织必须担负的重任。要担起这一重任，银行系统就必须深入农村，了解农民的具体要求，了解推销土产中各种各样的具体问题。
    第二、由于农产的丰收，若干土产的交流渐趋活跃，新区农民在土地改革或减租退押中得到相当巨大的经济利益，现在已经有很大一部分农民由不足变为有余，在广大农村中开展储蓄、保险业务的条件已经出现了。如果能及时开展这些业务，我们就能把农民的分散的资金积聚成强大的力量，集中地使用于发展生产，或帮助由于意外的灾害和疾病、死亡等原因而发生困难的农户。察哈尔省二百多个农村金融小组，三、四月中一个多月活动的结果，吸收存款四十五亿以上，超过去年年底全省私人存款总额近二十五亿的百分之八十。川南分行二月底统计，全区私人存款总额已达全区第一季（三月底止）存款任务百分之一八三。该区仁寿支行统计，私人存款中百分之九十八是农民存款。河北南宫产棉区官庄等四村二十四个普通户调查，去年收支相较，每人平均净余折米二五八斤。如不开展储蓄业务，这些资力就会积压在农民手里，不能周转活动。
    第三、解放了的农民，迫切地要求从各方面发展生产。他们要求开渠、打井、增肥料、买水车、买好牲口，以至新式大农具，要求提高生产技术，改善经营，增加单位面积产量。但是，仅仅集中他们的所余，还不足以满足这许多愿望，仍然需要国家银行以专用的农业贷款或周转性的短期贷款予以帮助。广大的为农民所需要的手工业、作坊及运销事业，也时常要求周转性贷款。给他们一定的帮助也是完全必要的。
    第四、中国农村如此广大，单靠银行的机构还不可能满足农民经常的、众多的资金调剂的要求。这就要求在农村中开展农民自己的信用合作和资金互助活动，并应建立信用社、信用部、资金互助小组、借贷介绍所等各种大小信用组织，发展自由借贷。对于这些信用组织，还须给以业务上的领导和资金上的支持。
    总之，农村中新的情况，要求国家银行系统深入地、全面地开展农村金融业务。过去把金融活动停止在城关附近，局限于季节性的农业贷款和简单的资金供给工作，已经远远不能适应现在的需要了。为担负起这一新的历史任务，此次农村金融会议决定将银行机构从县级再推下一层，选择较大的集镇（尤其是特产区的集镇）设立营业所，或组织流动性的农村金融工作小组，深入农村开展业务，这是重要的组织保证，各地必须用一切努力贯彻执行。有一些银行干部认为在农村中开展业务“费力大，效果小，风险大，麻烦多”因而抱着犹疑态度。这是由于没有从政治上认识这一工作的重大意义，应该进行深入的教育，彻底纠正。
    开展农村金融工作中的具体问题，会议已经做了许多具体的规定。其中特别值得注意的，是以下几个问题。
    首先，各地区应该在总的方针之下，根据当地具体情况与群众要求，确定自己当前主要的应该先进行什么。比如说，少数民族地区应该以帮助推销土产特产为主。华北、中南等地土产和特产已基本上销售了的地区则应猛力开展储蓄、保险。还有许多地区应该同时并进。灾区应以资金供给（贷款）及推动生产为主，丰收区则应以资金调剂为主。有的地区还应该是供给与调剂并重。这些都需要按当地条件和群众最迫切的要求而定，不能机械地或平均主义地加以规定。
    其次，要照顾农民的接受程度和特殊需要。比如要开展储蓄，就必须注意到有些农民不愿暴露财富和怕受物价影响的心理，应多多以事实教育农民，说通道理，消除顾虑。同时要多办爱国有奖储蓄和单一折实、保本保值的定期定额存款。例如开展棉花单一折实储蓄，以帮助国营贸易获得棉花，同时解除棉农的顾虑。或者根据农民的愿望，办理存贷结合的打井、开渠、买牲口等零存整付的储蓄。有的农民要求存实，亦可予以必要照顾（但须先和贸易合作部门联系，找好销路再接受）。为了解农民具体要求与困难，到村后应该深入进行农户访问，征求他们的意见。必须防止不明情况，命令行事，引起群众不满。
    再次，应该注意和有关部门密切联系、配合，争取一切可能的力量来协助工作。比如在帮助推销土产特产方面，要和贸易、合作等专管部门联系；发放贷款，要和农林、水利、种籽公司等专业经营机构结合。对广大区村干部，更需要经常联系，取得他们的协助。为取得区村干部协助，银行系统干部即需要主动配合中心工作。察哈尔有些金融小组配合区村干部宣传抗美援朝、镇压反革命，并在丰产运动中帮助做了一部分具体工作，结果取得各方协助，迅速开展了自己的工作。这一经验值得学习。另外，委托邮政局、合作社、贸易小组等为代理机构，聘请区村干部、小学教员、信贷员等为代理人员，在银行干部不足的情况下，都是必要的。
    农村金融工作中的许多部分，现在还是开始创办，干部和群众都不熟悉。各地党政领导机关，特别是各级财政经济委员会，必须认识到农村金融工作是关系国计民生的重大政治任务，大力加强领导，帮助克服困难，组织各方面的力量予以配合、协助、支持，使这次会议的决议能顺利贯彻下去。
