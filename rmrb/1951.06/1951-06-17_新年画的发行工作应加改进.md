To the Editor:

　　I went to Xiwei Village in Cheng'an County, Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province in April this year. Xiwei Village is a model cotton-producing village. According to the village cadres, the villagers' lives have been greatly improved due to good production. In just over 400 households, there are more than 100 bicycles. Thermos bottles and rubber shoes have become common items for farmers. Moreover, every household has pasted up fashionable beauty pictures and New Year pictures with Peking Opera content published in Shanghai and other places. It is said that more than 2,000 of these New Year pictures were sold in Xiwei Village. Some farmers asked me: "Why don't we print some New Year pictures ourselves?" Farmers are thirsting for new culture. Shanghai and Beijing have also printed a lot of new New Year pictures this year. Why can't we see them in Xiwei Village? Is it because too few were printed, or is the distribution work not done well? I hope art workers and New Year picture distribution organizations pay attention to this issue. Ding Zheng

To the Editor:

　　During the Spring Festival this year, I went from Beijing to Zhuozhou and Dingxing to understand the situation of literary and artistic work. Along the way, I wanted to inquire about the sales figures of New Year pictures in rural areas. But I was very disappointed. I did not see the shadow of New Year pictures in the counties and villages I passed. In fact, Beijing alone printed more than 30 kinds of New Year pictures this year. What is the reason for this? According to individual cadres, the distribution of New Year pictures sometimes only reaches the cities where the prefectural government is located, and New Year pictures are not distributed below the district level. If the facts are indeed like this, I hope our distribution work of New Year pictures will be greatly improved.

　　新年画的发行工作应加改进编辑同志：
    今年四月我到河北邯郸专区成安县的西魏村去了一次，西魏村是一个产棉模范村，据村干部告诉我，这村子由于生产搞得好，农民生活已经大为提高，仅仅四百多户人家，就有一百多辆脚踏车，热水瓶和橡胶鞋成为农民的普遍用品。而且家家户户都贴上上海等地出版的时装美女画和以京戏为内容的年画，据说这种年画在西魏村一共销售两千多张，有的农民问我：“咱们为啥不印些新年画哩？”农民是在渴求着新文化的，今年上海和北京也印了不少的新年画，为什么在西魏村就看不见哩？是印得太少，还是发行工作没有搞好呢？我希望美术工作者和年画发行机构重视这一个问题。  丁征编辑同志：
    今年春节期间，我曾由北京到涿县、定兴一带去了解文艺工作情况，一路上我很想打听新年画在农村中的销行数字。但是失望得很，在我所经过的县城和农村，没有看到新年画的影子。而事实上今年仅仅北京一处就印行了三十多种新年画，这到底是什么缘故哩？据个别干部反映，新年画的发行，有时仅能达到专区所在地的城市，区以下，新年画就发行不到了。如果事实的确如此，希望我们新年画的发行工作，要大大地加以改进。
