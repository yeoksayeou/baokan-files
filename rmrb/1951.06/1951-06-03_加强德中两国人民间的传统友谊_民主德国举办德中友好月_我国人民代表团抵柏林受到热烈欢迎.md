Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The Sino-German Friendship Month, initiated by the National Front of the German Democratic Republic, will begin on the 6th. A reporter recently interviewed Mr. Suige Huasai, a member of the National Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic, about the preparations for the Sino-German Friendship Month. The purpose of holding the Friendship Month is to enable the German people to further understand the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the leap-forward development since liberation, so as to strengthen the traditional friendship between the people of China and Germany. Before and after the start of the Friendship Month, the democratic parties and people's organizations affiliated to the National Front will jointly issue a statement to explain the significance of the Friendship Month to the German people, which will be the beginning of the movement. After the start of the Friendship Month, the Chinese People's Delegation invited here will travel to the capitals of various states and major cities and ports of the German Democratic Republic to report on the situation in New China and conduct extensive contacts with people from all walks of life. In order to vigorously introduce New China, the National Front will print 6 million copies each of propaganda materials and pictorials about New China and distribute them to the broad masses of people in urban and rural areas, and will print hundreds of thousands of booklets about New China for the exclusive use of propagandists. During the Friendship Month, Chinese films such as "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Liberated China," and "Daughters of China" with German dubbing and explanations will be shown. The German Cultural Association will hold a joint Sino-German art exhibition. At the same time, during the Friendship Month, the Sino-German Friendship Association will be established in Berlin, and branches will be established successively in various states of the German Democratic Republic.
　　During the Friendship Month, the National Front will do its best to let the people of West Germany know about this event and explain to them the importance of Sino-German friendship. Mass rallies will be held in towns and villages bordering West Germany's Lubeck and Hamburg, inviting people from West Germany to participate.
　　[This newspaper report] Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The Chinese People's Delegation, led by团长 Shen Junru, which came to the German Democratic Republic to participate in the Sino-German Friendship Month, arrived in Berlin on the afternoon of May 31. Those who welcomed them at the station included: Correns, Chairman of the National Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic, Nuschek, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Dahlem, member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party, Wang Dai, Minister of Education of the German Democratic Republic, Ziller, Minister of the Machine Industry, and members of the Berlin Young Pioneers. Ji Pengfei, head of our diplomatic mission to Germany, also came to the station to welcome them.
　　Correns delivered a welcome speech saying: "Just as all peace-loving German people are carrying out a great movement against the re-militarization of West Germany and striving to conclude a peace treaty in 1951, your representatives have arrived in Berlin. All peace-loving German people admire the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and want to learn from the Chinese people's experience in the struggle against imperialism. The German people also admire the great construction work that the Chinese people are carrying out under the leadership of Mao Zedong." Next, Nuschek welcomed the delegation on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic.
　　团长 Shen Junru replied: "There has been a long-standing friendship between the people of China and Germany. The victorious Chinese people deeply sympathize with the German people who are struggling for the independence, unification, peace and democracy of their motherland. The experience of the Chinese people's revolution proves that imperialism can certainly be defeated. Therefore, we firmly believe that the imperialists' sinister plot to split Germany and enslave the German people will also be thoroughly defeated."
　　That evening, the National Committee of the National Front of the German Democratic Republic hosted a banquet to welcome the delegation.
