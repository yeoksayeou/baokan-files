    Dalian Chemical Plant's Liu Zhao Youth Team Leads the Entire Workshop in Exceeding Production Plan
    The Liu Zhao Youth Team of Dalian Chemical Plant, starting from March of this year, has set monthly production competition plans to achieve new achievements in production to welcome the Party's birthday. Their promise has been fulfilled. As "July 1st" approaches, they have completed and greatly exceeded the production plan. Due to the promotion of the advanced experience of the Liu Zhao team in other teams in the gas production workshop, and due to the joint efforts of all comrades in the workshop, the production efficiency of water gas has been greatly improved. For example, the average production of water gas per furnace per hour is 4,864.5 cubic meters. The administrative department stipulates a production volume of 3,000 cubic meters per hour, and they exceed the quota by an average of 1,864.5 cubic meters per hour, with an excess production of more than 2.268 million cubic meters per furnace in three months. Each cubic meter is worth 289 yuan in RMB, adding more than 660 million yuan in income to the country. In terms of savings, the administration stipulates that one ton of coke produces 1,500 cubic meters of water gas. In April, this was increased to 1,700 cubic meters, and in May and June, it was increased to an average of 2,000 cubic meters. A total of 230 tons of coke were saved in three months, saving a total of 57.85 million yuan in RMB.
    During the three months, a total of 20 rationalization proposals were put forward, and calculating based on only five of them saved more than 447.44 million yuan in RMB.

  North Datong-Puzhou Railway Engineering Team Completes 39 Kilometers of Trunk Line Ahead of Schedule
    In order to welcome the Party's birthday, the North Datong-Puzhou Railway Engineering Team of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau completed the restoration project of the Yuanping to Xuangang section, a total of 39 kilometers of trunk line, four days ahead of schedule on June 16, saving 2.4 billion yuan in expenses. This section of the railway winds along mountains and rivers, with curve radii as small as 110 meters. There are many bridges and culverts along the line. All employees of the engineering team displayed a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm and completed the task ahead of schedule. During the three months of construction, no work-related injuries or accidents, large or small, occurred, creating a new record of no accidents in the Taiyuan Railway Bureau's road construction projects. The employees of the engineering team also came up with various ways to reduce costs. They mobilized the masses to excavate materials, and excavated two spans of steel beams, saving 300 million yuan in expenses; they seized the slack farming season to do earthwork, with low labor costs and without delaying farmers' production; they paid attention to the allocation of materials and avoided various wastes. The entire project saved a total of 2.4 billion yuan in expenses. Currently, the employees of the team are actively rushing to build roadside houses, station equipment, etc., striving to start passenger transport as soon as possible.

　　创造新的生产成绩庆祝共产党的生日

    大连化学厂刘钊青年小组带动全车间超额完成计划
    大连化学厂刘钊青年小组，从今年三月起，每月订出了生产竞赛计划，要在生产上取得新成就迎接党的生日。他们的诺言实现了，在“七一”将要来临的今天，他们完成并大大超过生产计划。由于刘钊小组的先进经验在造气车间其他小组中推广，由于全车间同志的共同努力，使水煤气生产效率大大提高。如一小时一个炉平均生产四千八百六十四点五立方公尺水煤气，行政方面规定产量一小时三千立方公尺，他们平均每小时超额完成一千八百六十四点五立方公尺，三个月一个炉超额增产二百二十六万八千多立方公尺。每立方公尺合人民币二百八十九元，共超额给国家增加收入人民币六亿六千余万元。再以节约来计算，行政上规定一吨焦炭出一千五百立方公尺水煤气，四月份提高到一千七百立方公尺，五、六月份平均提高到二千立方公尺，三个月共节省焦炭二百三十吨，共节省人民币五千七百八十五万元。
    在三个月期间共提出合理化建议二十件，其中仅按五件计算就节省了人民币四亿四千七百四十余万元。

  北同蒲路工程队提前修成三十九公里干线
    太原路局北同蒲工程队为了迎接党的生日，于六月十六日提前四天完成原平至轩岗段计三十九公里的干线修复工程，并节省经费二十四亿元。这段铁路依山傍水蜿蜒曲折，曲线半径有小至一一○公尺的。沿线桥梁涵渠很多。工程队全体职工发挥了高度的爱国主义劳动热情，提前完成任务。在三个月的施工过程中，未发生任何公伤与大小事故，创太原铁路局修路工程中无事故的新纪录。工程队的职工并且想出各种减低成本的办法。他们发动群众发掘器材，曾挖出钢梁二孔，节省经费三亿元；抓紧农暇做土石方，工价低廉，并且不误农民生产；注意材料的调配，避免各种浪费，全段工程共节省经费二十四亿元。现该队职工正积极赶筑沿线房屋、站场设备等，争取早日开始办理客运。
