Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: U.S. imperialism is accelerating its pace in re-arming West Germany. To encourage the West German reactionaries, who are terrified in the face of the powerful forces of peace and democracy, and to supervise and assist the Adenauer puppet government in accelerating the restoration of German militarism, the U.S. government has begun to dispatch the Fourth Infantry Division to West Germany, with its advance units arriving in Bremen harbor on May 27th.

	At the same time, the steps to rebuild the West German army are appearing in a more open manner. According to the German News Agency, the so-called "Border Police," the core of the West German mercenary army, will establish a central command organization in Bonn under the name of the "Border Police Command Post." This organization is, in effect, the supreme command of the West German mercenary army. Under this command, West Germany will be divided into twelve large "defense" zones, five medium "defense" zones, and twenty-nine small "defense" zones. These "Border Police" will all be motorized. Recruitment and training are actively underway, with plans to establish the first division of 10,000 men by the beginning of September. In addition, the Adenauer government has also established the supreme command of the West German navy under the name of "Headquarters of the Maritime Border Guard," which currently has jurisdiction over three small fleets.

	However, U.S. imperialism and its puppet Adenauer government continue to encounter a problem in these criminal activities, namely, the vast majority of West German people oppose war, and they find it difficult to find cannon fodder. The director of the "Domestic Security" department of the Adenauer government's Ministry of Interior, Agethe, admitted in a conversation with a reporter from the Associated Press that West German youth are not very willing to join the army.

　　美国加紧武装西德

    西德雇佣军最高指挥机构成立
    【新华社五日讯】美帝国主义重新武装西德的步伐正在加紧。为了给在强大的和平民主力量面前感到恐惧的西德反动派打气，并且为了监督与协助阿登纳傀儡政府加速恢复德国军国主义，美国政府开始派遣第四步兵师至西德，其先头部队已于五月二十七日到达不来梅港。
    与此同时，重建西德军队的步骤正以更加公开的面目出现。据德意志通讯社报道：作为西德雇佣军的核心的所谓“边境警察”即将以所谓“边境警察指挥所”的名义在波恩成立中央指挥机构。这个机构实际上就是西德雇佣军的最高司令部。在这司令部之下，西德将分为十二个大“防”区、五个中“防”区、二十九个小“防”区。这些“边境警察”将全部摩托化。招募及训练工作正在积极进行中，计划在九月初成立一万人的第一师。此外，阿登纳政府也已在“海上边防队本部”的名义下成立了西德海军的最高司令部，目前已辖有三支小舰队。
    但是，美帝国主义及其傀儡阿登纳政府在这些罪恶活动中继续遇到一个难题，那就是西德广大人民反对战争，他们很难找到炮灰。阿登纳政府内政部“国内治安”司司长爱吉底对美联社记者谈话中供认：西德青年都不大愿意当兵。
