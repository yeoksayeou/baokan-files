　　The Failure of the American Interventionists is Inevitable
    By Major General Kim Il, Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army
    The Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against the aggression of the American armed interventionists and their running dog, the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique, has been going on for a year.

    In the course of a year of combat, the Korean People's Army, our own armed forces, fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers, has continued to shatter the American imperialists' sinister plans for aggression against our country and people, and has effectively defended the independence, freedom, and honor of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    A year ago, the American imperialists thought that their sudden invasion would be enough to subdue the Korean People's Army and condemn the Korean people to a life of slavery. However, facts have proven that this was nothing more than a naive fantasy of the American imperialists. The American imperialists' military adventure has suffered a shameful and disastrous defeat.

    The Korean War has once again demonstrated the truth that the will and strength of a people educated in the era of Lenin and Stalin cannot be conquered by any force.

    The Workers' Party of Korea, guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and General Kim Il Sung, the leader of the Korean people, have roused the Korean people to participate in the sacred struggle and have organized the glorious victories of the Korean People's Army.

    Within the Korean People's Army, the strengthening of the Party's political work has armed commanders and fighters with advanced patriotic ideology, hatred for the enemy, and internationalist ideas, making our People's Army a strong revolutionary armed force with iron discipline and high morale.

    The Korean People's Army has been tempered in the course of actual combat and has grown into an army with the strength to achieve victory in any environment.

    The Korean people have achieved tremendous victories in the past year. The Korean people's heroic struggle to eliminate the American interventionists and their running dogs has weakened the strength of American imperialism and has become the banner of the national liberation struggle of colonial peoples around the world.

    The Korean people will never forget the Chinese people who resolutely supported the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during the difficult period of the temporary retreat of their own army and continued to provide sincere assistance.

    The movement to resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country, launched by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, is of historic significance in our struggle against a common enemy. The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, in the Korean War against American armed intervention, has brought about a tremendous change in the course of the war. The coordinated operations of the Chinese People's Volunteers have ensured and consolidated the new military victories of the Korean People's Army.

    The comradeship and friendship forged between the peoples of Korea and China in the flames of the long-term revolutionary struggle against a common enemy have been further consolidated through the Korean War.

    In the liberated areas, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are receiving the warm support and endorsement of the Korean people. The entire Korean people, inspired by the great victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are protecting their freedom and democratic rights, have risen up to participate in the work of supporting the front lines.

    The summary of the first year of the war shows that the American interventionists will suffer the same disastrous defeat in Korea as they did in China. The failure of the American interventionists on the Korean battlefield is a foregone conclusion.

    The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, fully aware of the purpose of the war, know that they are fighters defending their beloved motherland and world peace. They are not only proud of their just cause, but also have a strong confidence in victory. It is no accident that a large number of combat heroes and model fighters are constantly emerging in the ranks of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    The course of the war has caused the morale of the American mercenaries to decline day by day. They are trembling because the crimes they have committed in Korea will be met with the hammer of revenge. The deterioration of the morale of the American mercenaries shows that the failure of the American interventionists is irreversible.

    In the course of the war, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have grown stronger, have a solid rear, and are receiving warm support from the people of the world. There is no doubt that they will completely eliminate the American aggressor bandits and their running dogs on Korean soil.

　　美国干涉者的失败已成定局
    朝鲜人民军总政治局副局长  金日少将
    朝鲜人民为抗击美国武装干涉者及其走狗李承晚卖国匪帮的侵略而进行的祖国解放战争，已经一周年了。
    朝鲜人民自己的武装力量—朝鲜人民军，在一年的战斗过程中，在和中国人民志愿军并肩作战中，继续粉碎着美帝国主义对我们祖国和人民的凶恶侵略计划，有效地保卫着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立、自由和荣誉。
    一年前，美帝国主义者以为它的突然进犯足以使朝鲜人民军屈服，足以使朝鲜人民遭到奴隶的命运。然而，事实证明：这不过是美帝国主义者极幼稚的幻想而已。美帝国主义者的军事冒险，已遭到可耻的惨败。
    朝鲜战争又一次说明了一个真理：在列宁—斯大林时代受到教育的人民的斗争意志和力量，是任何力量所不能征服的。
    以马克思列宁主义理论为行动指针的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军，唤起朝鲜人民参加神圣的斗争，组织了朝鲜人民军的光辉胜利。
    在朝鲜人民军部队内部，党的政治工作的加强，使指挥员和战斗员以先进的爱国主义思想、对敌人的憎恨和国际主义思想武装起来，使我们人民军成为具有钢铁般的纪律和高昂士气的坚强的革命武装队伍。
    朝鲜人民军在实际战斗的过程中受到锻炼，已壮大成为具有在任何环境中取得胜利的力量的军队。
    朝鲜人民在过去的一年中，业已取得了巨大的胜利。朝鲜人民为消灭美国干涉者及其走狗而进行的英勇斗争，削弱了美帝国主义的力量，而成为当前全世界殖民地民族解放斗争的旗帜。
    朝鲜人民永远不会忘记在自己的军队实行暂时撤退的严重时期坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并继续给予热诚援助的中国人民。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导下所展开的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，在我们反抗共同敌人的斗争中，具有历史的意义。中国人民的优秀儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军，为反对美国武装干涉者而参加朝鲜战争；这一举动，使战争的进程发生了巨大的转变。中国人民志愿军的协同作战，保障和巩固了朝鲜人民军新的军事上的胜利。
    朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的长期革命斗争火焰中所结成的战友关系和友谊团结，通过朝鲜战争而更加巩固了。
    在解放地区，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军受着朝鲜人民的热烈支持和拥护。全朝鲜人民被保护其自由和民主权利的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利所鼓舞，一致奋起参加着支援前线的工作。
    战争一周年的总结说明：美国干涉者在朝鲜将遭到如同在中国一样的惨败。美国干涉者在朝鲜战场上的失败。已成定局。
    充分明了战争目的的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，知道自己是保卫自己可爱的祖国和世界和平的斗士。他们不但以自己的正义事业为光荣，而且有着坚强的胜利信心。在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的队伍里，大批战斗英雄和模范战斗员的不断涌现，绝不是偶然的事情。
    战争的进程使美国雇佣兵的士气日益低落。他们因为自己在朝鲜造下的罪行将要遭到复仇的铁锤而发抖。美国雇佣兵士气的恶化，说明美国干涉者的失败是无可挽回的。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在战争过程中，日益壮大，拥有巩固的后方，受到全世界人民的热烈支援。他们在朝鲜疆土上一定会彻底消灭美国侵略强盗及其走狗，这是不容置疑的。
