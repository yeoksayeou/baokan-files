　　New Village Farmers in Mianyang County, Western Sichuan, Examine and Revise Patriotic Pact
　　After completing land reform, the farmers of New Village, Shintang Township, Mianyang County, Western Sichuan, held a meeting on June 2nd to examine the implementation of the patriotic pact, and added new patriotic pacts. This village's farmers formulated nine patriotic pacts in April this year, but because the clauses were complicated and mostly impractical, everyone did not seriously implement them. At the meeting, everyone reviewed the erroneous thinking of not paying attention to the patriotic pacts, and based on the situation in the village where one-third of the cotton seedlings in some cotton fields had died due to drought, and some rice seedlings had not yet been transplanted, they re-formulated five patriotic pacts. The village propagandist compiled the summer patriotic pacts into a "jingle": First, transplant the rice seedlings well to plant late rice, accumulate fertilizer, catch insects and diligently weed, and organize the production mutual aid groups well. Second, increase grain production by one sheng per mu of land and donate it to the volunteers to kill the enemy. Third, everyone should treat the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers well (families of martyrs and families of soldiers), help with cultivation and doing work, so that the lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are happy. Fourth, open more canals to store water in ponds, feed chickens, ducks and pigs well, and work together to prevent drought and prepare for disasters. Fifth, expose hidden "counter-revolutionaries," guard warehouses, guard the night, prevent fires, and eliminate the American imperialist running dogs. After the patriotic pacts were formulated, the villagers, men, women, old and young, quickly memorized them. At the meeting, everyone also elected an inspection team, with one month as a period, to draft a plan for the whole village to implement the patriotic pacts at the beginning of the month, check the implementation at the end of the month, and conduct spot checks on a temporary basis. Currently, 260 young adults in the village have formed ten mutual aid groups to carry water to irrigate cotton fields, and have saved the cotton seedlings in 96 mu of cotton fields in the village, and first irrigated the cotton fields of two military families. All the farmers in the village also plan to fill the two ponds on the hillside with water within ten days to prevent drought. They also strictly guard the roads and water wells, and captured two counter-revolutionary elements who were spreading poison.

　　川西绵阳县新村农民检查修订爱国公约
    川西绵阳县石塘乡新村农民于六月二日集会检查爱国公约执行情况后，并增订了新的爱国公约。该村农民完成土地改革后，今年四月即订立了九项爱国公约，但因条文繁杂，大多不切合实际，大家都没有认真执行。会上，大家都检讨了没有重视爱国公约的错误思想，并根据村子里有的棉田棉苗旱死三分之一，有的秧田还没有移栽的情况，重新订立了五条爱国公约。该村宣传员将夏季爱国公约编成了“顺口溜”，即：一、插好秧子栽晚稻，积肥捉虫勤除草，把生产互助组组织好。二、每亩田增产粮食捐一升，献给志愿军杀敌人。三、大家优待烈军属（烈士家属、军人家属），帮助耕种帮做活，烈军属生活才安乐。四、多开水渠储满塘，喂好鸡鸭和猪羊，齐心防旱备灾荒。五、检举暗藏的“反革命”，护仓守夜防火警，把美国鬼子走狗除干净。爱国公约订出后，村上男女老幼很快就背熟了。会上，大家又选举出检查小组，以一个月为一期，月初拟订全村执行爱国公约的计划，月底检查执行情况，并临时进行抽查。现该村有二百六十个青壮年组成了十个互助组，挑水灌棉田，已救活了全村九十六亩棉田的棉苗，并首先灌活了两家军属的棉田。全村农民并计划在十天内将山坡上的两个埝塘储满水，防备干旱。他们并严密守路、护水井，捕获了两个放毒的反革命分子。
