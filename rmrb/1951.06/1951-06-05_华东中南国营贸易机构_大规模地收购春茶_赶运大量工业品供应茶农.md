State-Owned Trade Organizations in East China and Central South China
　　Massively Purchase Spring Tea
　　Rush Industrial Goods to Supply Tea Farmers
Spring tea in East China and Central South China has been massively launched on the market. State-owned trade organizations are now conducting large-scale and organized comprehensive purchases and are rushing large quantities of daily-use industrial products, grain, and fertilizer to the countryside to supply tea farmers.
　　Before purchasing spring tea, state-owned tea companies in various parts of Central South China took various measures to support tea production. State-owned tea companies in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces issued a total of 12.7 billion yuan in spring tea picking loans to help tea farmers solve the difficulties of repairing tools and obtaining food. The tea companies in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi also loaned 380 tea kneading machines to tea-producing areas. This type of machine can improve the efficiency of kneading tea (an essential step in the tea processing process) by more than four times. State-owned tea factories in various parts of Central South China also sent mobile tea-making teams to guide tea farmers in improving their techniques for making black tea. At the same time, they also set up baking stations to bake wet tea leaves for tea farmers. After mid-April, when spring tea was launched on the market in large quantities, state-owned tea companies and tea factories in Central South China, in addition to establishing more than 140 tea purchasing stations in the tea-producing areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, also organized mobile purchasing teams to purchase spring tea in areas with inconvenient transportation.
　　Before mid-April this year, the East China branch of the state-owned China Tea Company had already established 168 purchasing offices, purchasing stations, and many mobile purchasing teams in tea areas in Zhejiang, southern Anhui, northern Anhui, and Fujian. Cooperatives at all levels scattered throughout the tea areas generally took on the task of collecting tea on behalf of the state-owned tea company. In addition, public-private purchasing consultation committees were established in all tea areas before the purchasing process. Under the leadership of state-owned trade organizations, the committees rationally allocated purchasing areas and quantities and determined tea prices based on the principle of taking into account the interests of production, transportation, and sales, encouraging private merchants to engage in the domestic sales of tea as much as possible.
　　In order to cooperate with the tea purchasing work, the commodity supply network in tea areas, composed of state-owned department stores, grain, native products, salt industry companies, and cooperatives, has begun to supply large quantities of cloth, daily-use industrial products, grain, and fertilizer. In the Tunxi Special Zone, a major tea-producing area in southern Anhui, the supply of white cloth to tea farmers reached about 30,000 bolts, more than double that of last year. Private merchants in various places are also actively transporting goods to the countryside. State-owned trade companies in Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places have also transferred a large number of grains, salt, cloth, and general merchandise to tea purchasing stations to supply tea farmers at reasonable prices. Tea farmers are very happy because the prices of goods have remained stable as usual since the tea was launched on the market. In some areas of Zhejiang, tea farmers actively helped the sales teams of state-owned department stores to put up advertisements and spread the word everywhere, becoming voluntary propagandists for promoting goods.
　　This year, state-owned trade organizations have conducted large-scale preparations for this purpose. About one-third of the more than 4,000 factories in Shanghai's cotton yarn copying, daily necessities, cigarettes, soap, and match industries have accepted large orders from state-owned department stores, and their production has increased rather than decreased compared to the peak season last winter.

　　华东中南国营贸易机构
    大规模地收购春茶
    赶运大量工业品供应茶农
    华东区、中南区春茶已大量上市，国营贸易机构正大规模地有组织地进行全面收购，并赶运大量日用工业品、粮食和肥料下乡供应茶农。
    在收购春茶前，中南区各地国营茶业公司曾采取各种措施扶助茶叶生产。湖南、湖北、江西三省国营茶业公司共发放了春茶采摘贷款一百二十七亿元，帮助茶农解决整修工具和口粮的困难。湖南、湖北、江西的茶业公司又在茶产区贷放了茶叶揉捻机三百八十部，这种机器可使揉捻茶叶（茶叶加工过程中的一个必经步骤）的效能提高四倍以上，中南区各地公营制茶厂并派出流动制茶小组，指导茶农改进制作红茶的技术，同时又设立了烘焙站，代茶农烘焙茶叶湿胚。四月中旬以后，春茶大量上市，中南区国营茶业公司、制茶厂除在湖南、湖北、江西三省茶产区设立了一百四十多个茶叶收购站外，并组织流动收购小组，到交通不便地区收购春茶。
    今年四月中旬以前，国营中国茶业公司华东区公司在浙江、皖南、皖北及福建等地茶区已设立了一百六十八个收购处、收购站和许多流动收购组。散布在茶区的各级合作社普遍担任了为国营茶业公司代收的任务。此外，各茶区在收购前都成立了公私收购协商委员会，在国营贸易机构的领导下，合理分配好收购地区和数量，并在照顾产、运、销三方面利益的原则下确定了茶价，鼓励私商尽量从事内销茶的经营。
    为了配合茶叶收购工作，国营百货、粮食、土产、盐业等专业公司与合作社构成的茶区货品供应网，已开始大量供应布匹、日用工业品、粮食和肥料。在皖南主要产茶区屯溪专区供应茶农的白布即达三万匹左右，超过去年一倍。各地私商也积极运货物下乡。湖南、江西等地的国营贸易公司也调集了大批粮食、食盐、布匹、百货到茶叶收购站按合理价格供应茶农。茶农们因茶叶上市后物价稳定如常，非常高兴。浙江部分地区茶农积极帮助国营百货公司的推销组张贴广告，到处传告，成为推销货品的义务宣传员。
    今年国营贸易机构曾为此进行了大规模的准备工作。上海棉纱复制、日用品、香烟、肥皂、火柴业等四千多家工厂，有三分之一左右因为接受了国营百货公司的大批定货，生产较去冬旺季有增无减。
