    (I) Launch a Patriotic Emulation Drive to Increase Production and Donate Weapons

    The proposal made by this association on June 1st to conduct a nationwide campaign to increase production and donate weapons has quickly received enthusiastic responses from people from all walks of life across the country. All democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life—including workers, farmers, government employees, students, industrialists and businessmen, and those in cultural and educational circles—are actively participating in this great patriotic action. The enthusiasm of the masses is so high that this movement has taken on the nature of a patriotic emulation drive from the very beginning. Workers in some places have already launched long-term challenges for increased production and donations within factories and between factories. The entire delegation of industrialists and businessmen from the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has also called on industrialists and businessmen across the country to voluntarily launch donation challenges, with some even proposing to strive for the glorious title of "Industrial and Commercial Circles Supporting Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea"; moreover, some places (such as Tunxi City in Southern Anhui) have already issued challenges to industrialists and businessmen nationwide. These patriotic and heroic challenge initiatives are correct and necessary; they will further enhance the patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country, promote the widespread and enthusiastic development of the donation movement, and thereby rapidly supply a large number of weapons to the Volunteer Army to annihilate the enemy and strive for the early realization of the final victory in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

    As pointed out in this association's June 1st announcement: the movement to donate weapons must be combined with the movement to increase production and increase income. Only in this way can we strengthen the construction of our country and further improve the people's lives while strengthening support for the front lines, so that the public interests of the country and the individual interests of the masses can be closely coordinated; only in this way can this movement be carried out for a long time, and can more weapons be continuously sent to the front lines until the imperialist robbers who invaded Korea are completely eliminated. This means that while highly promoting the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, we must also be good at cherishing and maintaining the enthusiasm of the masses. In particular, for workers, farmers, and other working people, the amount of their donations should be appropriate to avoid causing difficulties in their lives. Workers in Beijing and Tianjin have already adopted methods such as donating a fixed monthly quota, increasing output and quality and donating all extra wages, and working overtime for one day within a certain period and donating all wages earned; farmers in the fourteen districts of suburban Beijing have guaranteed to increase production by 10% this year and donate a portion of the increased income to support the front lines. These methods are all very good, can be used for a long time, and are worth referring to in other places.

### （一）展开增加生产、捐献武器的爱国竞赛

    （一）展开增加生产、捐献武器的爱国竞赛
    本会六月一日提出的在全国进行增加生产、捐献武器运动的建议，已经迅速获得各地各界人民的热烈响应。全国各民主党派、各人民团体以及各界人民——包括工人、农民、机关工作人员、学生、工商界、文化教育界都正在纷纷参加这个伟大的爱国行动。人民群众的情绪是这样热烈，以致这个运动一开始就具有爱国竞赛的性质。有些地方的工人，已经在工厂的内部和各个工厂之间，提出长期增产捐献的挑战竞赛。中国人民赴朝慰问团的全体工商界代表也已经号召全国各地的工商界自动自觉地展开一个捐献挑战，有的并提出争取“抗美援朝工商界”的光荣称号；而且有的地方（例如皖南屯溪市）的工商界已经向全国工商界提出挑战。这种爱国主义的英雄主义的挑战竞赛的举动是正确的、必要的，它将更加提高全国人民的爱国积极性，推动捐献运动普遍、热烈地展开，从而能够迅速地以大量的武器供给志愿军去歼灭敌人，争取抗美战争最后胜利的早日实现。
    正如本会六月一日的文告所指出：捐献武器运动，必须与增加生产、增加收入的运动相结合。因为只有如此，才能在加强支援前线的同时，更加加强我们国家的建设，更加改善人民的生活，使国家的公共利益和人民群众的个人利益密切地配合起来；只有如此，才能使这一运动长期地进行下去，才能源源不绝地以更多武器送到前线去，直到把侵略朝鲜的帝国主义强盗完全消灭为止。这就是说：在高度地发扬人民群众的爱国热情的同时，又要善于珍惜和保持群众的热情，特别是对于工人、农民和其他劳动群众，要使他们捐献的数目适当，以免造成他们生活的困难。北京和天津的工人，已经采取按月定额捐献，提高产量和质量、以全部额外工资捐献，在一定时间内加班一日、以所得全部工资捐献等办法；北京市郊十四区的农民保证今年增产一成，以增产所得的一部捐献出来，支援前线。这些办法都是很好的，可以长期采用的，值得其他地方参考。
