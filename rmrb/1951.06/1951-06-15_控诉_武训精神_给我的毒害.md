Accusation of the Poisoning Effect of the "Wu Xun Spirit" on Me

Editor:
　　I used to admire the "Wu Xun Spirit" very much, and therefore suffered a great deal of poisoning from it. Now I want to accuse the "Wu Xun Spirit" of the poisoning effect it had on me!
　　In 1941, I left Beijing for Chongqing with great enthusiasm. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government was corrupt, decadent, anti-people, and did not resist Japan, which made me feel disappointed and angry. Just when I was in the most distress, I obtained a copy of Zhang Mosheng's "Biography of Wu Xun." This book gave me a "way out" -- I began to admire Wu Xun. Later, I was admitted to the Department of Literature and History of Xianghui College in Beibei, Chongqing. The head of the Department of Literature and History was Zhang Mosheng, the author of "Biography of Wu Xun," and I planned to obtain more of the "Wu Xun Spirit" from him. As a result, I got what I "wished" for and further learned the Wu Xun Spirit from Mr. Zhang.
　　At that time, I did not believe in the Marxist theory of class struggle. I was indifferent to the surging student movement at that time. I mistakenly thought that others had not seen the fundamental crux of the matter. My admiration for Wu Xun was entirely due to idealism. Someone wrote a poem praising Wu Xun: "A thread winds out a great cause for thousands of years, who says a beggar has no good end." I also firmly believed that Wu Xun was "sincere enough to move mountains," and as long as I buried myself in hard work, I would create a "great" "cause." Therefore, I did not trust the masses and was unwilling to participate in any organization. This idea has been influencing me. After liberation, when a classmate introduced me to the Youth League, I showed hesitation.
　　Recently, I came to the Northeast and felt the urgent need for political study more than ever before. After studying, my political level improved somewhat. Since the discussion about the film "The Story of Wu Xun" unfolded, I have been awakened. I enthusiastically read the articles in the newspaper criticizing Wu Xun. The huge Wu Xun idol in my heart has gradually been turned into a pool of sewage and mud by the sunshine of Marxism. I must pour it out without leaving any trace.

### 控诉“武训精神”给我的毒害

　　控诉“武训精神”给我的毒害编辑同志：
    我过去非常崇拜“武训精神”，因此受了很大的毒害。我现在要控诉“武训精神”给我的毒害！
    一九四一年，我满怀热情离开北京，到了重庆。蒋介石反动政府贪污、腐败、反人民、不抗战，使我感到失望、气愤。正在最苦闷的时候，我得到一本张默生著的《武训传》。这本书使我找到了“出路”——我开始崇拜武训了。以后，我考入重庆北碚相辉学院文史系。该校文史系主任就是《武训传》作者张默生，我打算从他那里获得更多的“武训精神”。结果我如“愿”以偿，从张先生进一步学习了武训精神。
    我当时对马克思主义的阶级斗争学说是不相信的。我对当时澎湃的学生运动是不闻不问的。我错误地认为别人没有看清楚事情的根本症结。我崇拜武训完全是唯心论作祟。有人写诗赞武训：“线头缠出千秋业，谁道乞人无下场。”我也深信武训是“精诚所至，金石为开”，只要自己埋头苦干，就会创造一番“伟大”的“事业”。因此，我不相信群众，不愿意参加任何团体。这思想一直影响着我。解放后，有同学介绍我入团时，我就表现了犹豫。
    最近，我到了东北，空前地感到政治学习的迫切需要。经过学习，我的政治水平提高了一些。自从关于电影《武训传》的讨论展开后，我才惊醒了。我热情地读着报上批判武训的文章。在我心中巨大的武训偶像，已经逐渐被马克思主义的阳光晒成一滩污水烂泥。我必须一点也不留地把它倾吐出来。
