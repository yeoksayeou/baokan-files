　　The Ganqing Highway is a vital transportation route in the Northwest
    Transportation departments should pay attention to driving safety
Editor:
    On April 14th, an unfortunate overturning accident occurred on the Ganqing Highway in Northwest China. The accident site was on a stone bridge 22.5 kilometers west of Lanzhou. Out of 27 people in the vehicle, only one was uninjured, four were slightly injured, and the rest were seriously injured. Five people died that day.
    Based on this overturning accident and what I have seen on the Ganqing Highway, I would like to offer some suggestions to the relevant transportation departments.
    First, let's talk about the cause of the accident. According to the driver, the tie rod screw on the steering wheel broke. The vehicle went out of control and plunged off the bridge. However, according to everyone's analysis, it was related to the following factors: 1. The driver turned off the ignition switch on the downhill to save fuel, resulting in a high speed and the failure of the safety brake in the event of danger; 2. The vehicle was old and had exceeded its service life; 3. The driver's skills were poor; 4. Insufficient attention was paid to driving safety, and the vehicle was not carefully inspected and repaired. Needless to say, the overturned vehicle was in bad shape. According to the driver of a vehicle behind us, the brakes were not very effective, and there was no horn. It is easy for such vehicles to cause accidents on the Ganqing Highway.
    Let's also talk about the work style of the Lanzhou Station: On April 12th, the station announced: Tickets to Xining will be sold at 9:00 am tomorrow. The next day, people lined up on time to buy tickets, but tickets were not sold until after 10:00 am. When asked about the person in charge of the station, he said: It was written that tickets would be sold on the 13th, and any time is fine. This bureaucratic style is really unacceptable.
    In addition, the poor road surface of the Ganqing Highway is also a very serious problem. Xiangtang is located at the midpoint of the Ganqing Highway (Lanzhou to Xining) and is also the border between Gansu and Qinghai. The highway is also completely different here. The road surface from Xiangtang to Xining (all within Qinghai) is very flat, covered with crushed stones and fine sand, and planted with green willows on both sides of the road. The road surface from Xiangtang to Hekou (40 kilometers from Lanzhou) is uneven, with a lot of dust in some sections. When the wind blows, it is very difficult for the driver to drive. Some road surfaces have large holes in the middle, and the ditches washed out by rain last summer have not been leveled. The vehicle travels bumpy. The road surface is narrow in places near mountains and rivers, and the stone tips left by the opening of the mountain protrude from the road surface. The fallen rocks are not cleaned up, which affects driving and passenger safety. Some people say: "This section of road blocks Qinghai." For the sake of transportation and passenger safety in the Northwest, I have the following suggestions for the transportation departments:
    1. Strengthen the technical and ideological appraisal of drivers. Those who are unqualified should not be allowed to serve as drivers; 2. Strengthen the inspection and trial run of vehicles before they leave the factory. Unqualified vehicles should not be allowed to leave the factory; 3. Regularly inspect the road protection situation and hope to repair the Ganqing Road; 4. Strengthen the ideological education of employees to serve the people.

### 甘青公路是西北的交通要道  交通部门应注意行车的安全

　　甘青公路是西北的交通要道        
    交通部门应注意行车的安全编辑同志：
    四月十四日在西北甘青公路上发生了翻车的不幸事件。翻车地点在兰州以西二二点五公里处一座石桥上。全车二十七人，只有一人未受伤，有四名轻伤，其余都是重伤，当天死亡五人。
    通过这次翻车事故及我在甘青公路上所看到的情形，特对有关交通部门提出几点意见。
    先说这次翻车的原因。据司机谈，是汽车方向盘拉杆螺丝断了。车子不听指挥冲下桥去。但据大家的分析，却和下列情况有关：一、司机为了节省汽油，在下坡时将电门关了，车速很大，遇险时安全煞车失效；二、车子破旧已超过保用年限；三、司机技术差；四、对行车安全不够重视，车子未认真检修。翻了的车不用说了，在我们后面的一辆车子，据司机谈，煞车也不大灵，且没有喇叭。这样的车子在甘青公路上开行，是容易出危险的。
    再谈一些兰州车站的工作作风问题：该站四月十二日公布：明日上午九时售西宁车票。第二天购票的人早按时排好了队，一直到十点多钟才售票。问车站负责人，他却说：写的十三日售票，什么时间都可以。这种官僚主义的作风实在要不得。
    另外，甘青公路的路面不好，也是很严重的问题。享堂位于甘青公路（兰州至西宁）的中点，也是甘青分界处。就公路来说，也截然不同。享堂往西至西宁（全在青海境内）路面很平坦，上铺碎石细砂，路两旁栽了青青杨柳。享堂往东至河口（离兰州四十公里），路面则凸凹不平，有一段尘土很多，刮起风来，司机开车有很大困难；有的路面中间陷了大洞，去年夏季雨水冲的沟一直未平，车行巅簸不止，靠山临河的地方路面窄狭，开山留下的石尖凸出路面，掉下的山石也无人收拾，影响行车和旅客安全。有人说：“这一段路封锁了青海。”为了西北的交通和旅客的安全，我对交通部门有以下几点建议：
    一、加强司机同志的技术和思想鉴定工作，不合格不能充任司机；二、加强车子的检修和出厂的试车工作，不合格的车子不让出厂；三、经常检查护路情况并希望整修甘青路；四、加强职工为人民服务的思想教育。
