　　Five Newly Published Children's Books
            "Chairman Desk and Chair"
            Written by Jiang Shanye, illustrated by Liu Yiyan, published by China Youth Publishing House in January of this year.
    This book includes five short stories, all about stories that often happen among school children. The stories are very ordinary and small, but they are all vivid and real.
    The children in the stories all have their own shortcomings: they are mischievous, impatient, and prone to quarrels. But at the same time, they are all innocent and pure. Under the education of New Democracy, with good teachers and good mothers to educate and help them, they will develop excellent qualities such as love for labor, care for public property, friendship, and unity.
            "Lu Xun and His Childhood Friends"
            Written by Xue Feng, illustrated by Wu Wei, published by China Youth Publishing House in January of this year.
    This book tells the story of Lu Xun making friends with the children of the working people in his childhood. Because Lu Xun made friends with the children of the working people, he not only increased a lot of knowledge, but also cultivated a deep affection for the working people. Lu Xun's ability to become a writer, thinker, and revolutionary is greatly related to his childhood friends. From these stories, we can also see the simple and beautiful character of the children of the working people; they are the most loyal, smartest, and cleverest children.
            "Little Masters of the Mine"
            Written by Miao Yu, illustrated by Cheng Guo, published by China Youth Publishing House in March of this year.
    This book tells the story of the transformation of a group of miner's children in the Huainan coal mine. Because it was not long after liberation, there was no decent school for the children of miners to attend, so this group of children wandered around all day, climbing trains, fighting, causing trouble everywhere, and even stealing things. The cultural and educational minister of the mine's trade union was a member of the Youth League. He educated them and organized them to form a children's team. The young pioneers kept watch to protect state property. They also picked out the unburned coal cinders from the mine, saving the mine a lot of fuel. Their achievements were praised by the trade union and their parents. In this way, under the leadership of the mine's trade union and the Youth League, these children became the little masters of the mine.
            "Little Hero Yu Lai"
            Written by Guan Hua, first edition published by Sanlian Bookstore in April of this year.
    The content of this book tells the story of the young pioneer Yu Lai's heroic and unyielding spirit during the Anti-Japanese War. Yu Lai is a lively and mischievous child, and like all the young pioneers in the liberated areas, he stands guard and delivers letters, and he always completes his tasks well. He was captured by the Japanese devils twice, but he endured the enemy's cruel torture, refused the enemy's enticements, and never betrayed his beloved Uncle Li and the guerrillas. This story fully demonstrates the most excellent qualities of Chinese children in loving their motherland. This book is a very good patriotic reading material.
            "Mao Nizi Deceives the Horse"
            Written by Liu Raomin, first edition published by Sanlian Bookstore in early April of this year.
    This book is a fairy tale poem that includes four stories from the Anti-Japanese War period. One of them is the story of the exemplary behavior of the Eighth Route Army soldier Zhou Liyuan. He was a labor model for the entire army, and the people called him "the good model of the Eighth Route Army." He died heroically in a battle. The other three are all stories about the heroic battles of children in the liberated areas. They used their wit, bravery, and spirit of fearlessness of sacrifice to strike the enemy and save the lives of the entire village. The stories are all very educational.
