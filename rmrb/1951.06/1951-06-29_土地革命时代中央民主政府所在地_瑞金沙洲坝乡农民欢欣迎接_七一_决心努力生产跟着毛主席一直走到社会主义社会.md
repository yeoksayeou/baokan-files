　　The Site of the Central Democratic Government During the Land Revolution

    Farmers in Shazhouba Township, Ruijin, Joyfully Welcome "July 1st"
    Resolve to Work Hard and Follow Chairman Mao All the Way to Socialist Society
    A Xinhua News Agency reporter visited Shazhouba Township, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province – the site of the Central Democratic Government during the Land Revolution – on the eve of "July 1st." Farmers throughout the township are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. The township farmers' association and the Communist Youth League branch have decided to hold a township-wide farmers' celebration in Shazhouba Village, the former residence of Chairman Mao, on "July 1st." To welcome visitors from all over, the farmers of Shazhouba Village have cleaned Chairman Mao's former residence and prepared to display various revolutionary relics from the Land Revolution era inside.
    These days, the courtyard in front of Chairman Mao's former residence has become lively in the evenings. Farmers are building colorful arches there. Many farmers who participated in the Land Revolution are gathering under an ancient camphor tree to reminisce about revolutionary struggles. Women and children in night school literacy classes are practicing the flower-drum dance and rehearsing new plays in preparation for the "July 1st" celebration program.
    Shazhouba Township completed land reform last winter. Land has been returned to the hands of the farmers. After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist Japan in October 1934, the landlord class seized the land gained by the farmers in the Land Revolution and carried out cruel massacres. Twenty-three revolutionary farmers in the village were brutally killed. After recalling the history of the past twenty years, the farmers of Shazhouba Village used a metaphor to tell the reporter: "Farmers cannot be separated from the Communist Party, just as rice seedlings cannot be separated from water."
    The farmers of Shazhouba Village are overflowing with boundless love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. On the afternoon the reporter arrived in the village, Yang Shihan, chairman of the township farmers' association, led him to visit Chairman Mao's former residence and the former site of the Central Democratic Government. Evergreen pines and cypresses have been planted in front of and behind Chairman Mao's former residence. At the former site of the Central Democratic Government, wooden signs are placed, with the names of the various departments written on them. The farmers of Shazhouba cherish every historical trace left by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Even a well dug in the village in 1933 when Chairman Mao was there now has a wooden sign erected next to it, with the words "Drink water and never forget the well-digger, always remember Chairman Mao" written in red paint. The farmers said that since there was this well, the villagers no longer drank unclean pond water.
    This spring, every household in Shazhouba Village has formulated patriotic production increase plans. All paddy fields must achieve "three plows and four harrows, three cultivations and two dressings (topdressing)." Fertilizer application must be increased by one-third to one-half compared to previous years. Now, the rice in the whole village is growing luxuriantly and strongly, and a good harvest is expected this year. Thirty households in Shazhouba Village have voluntarily organized three mutual aid teams. They are studying ways to improve farming techniques and increase yields. Yang Ronglan, a labor model and leader of a mutual aid team, tried using a kind of processed cow bone ash as fertilizer in a peanut field last year, and harvested 400 more catties of peanuts per mu than others. Now, all the farmers in the township have learned this method. Last year, after the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's cultural service team came here to show Soviet agricultural production newsreels, the farmers were filled with confidence in a bright future. Yang Musheng, a Communist Youth League member and farmer, told reporters that their mutual aid team plans to buy a waterwheel together after this autumn harvest. He said: "Let's work hard to increase production. In a few years, the worker brothers will manufacture machines for us so that we can use tractors to cultivate the land like Soviet farmers." They believe that as long as they always follow the Communist Party, they will surely create a better and happier life.
    On the eve of "July 1st," the congratulatory letter jointly written by the farmers of the whole township to Chairman Mao stated: "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the farmers of our whole township have begun to restore the happy life of the Ruijin Democratic Government era. In the future, we will definitely work harder and more actively to develop production, follow you to socialist society, and be like the Soviet big brother. We wish you longevity."

　　土地革命时代中央民主政府所在地
    瑞金沙洲坝乡农民欢欣迎接“七一”
    决心努力生产跟着毛主席一直走到社会主义社会
    新华社记者在“七一”前夕访问了土地革命时代中央民主政府所在地——江西瑞金县沙洲坝乡。全乡农民正在热烈筹备庆祝中国共产党诞生的三十周年。乡农民协会和青年团支部决定“七一”在毛主席故居沙洲坝村举行全乡农民庆祝会。为了迎接各地来的参观者，沙洲坝村的农民已经把毛主席故居打扫得干干净净，还准备在室内陈列土地革命时代的各种革命文物。
    这几天，一到傍晚，毛主席故居前面的庭园里就热闹起来了。农民们正在那里搭彩门。很多当年曾经参加过土地革命的农民们，聚集在一颗古老的大樟树下回忆革命斗争故事。夜校识字班的妇女和儿童们，为了准备“七一”庆祝会的表演节目，正在练习打花棍，排新戏。
    沙洲坝乡是在去年冬天完成土地改革的。土地又回到农民手里了。一九三四年十月，当中国工农红军北上抗日以后，地主阶级夺去了农民们在土地革命中获得的田地并进行了残酷的屠杀。村里有二十三个革命农民被残杀了。沙洲坝村的农民在回忆了近二十年来的历史以后，向记者打着比喻说：“农民离不开共产党，就像禾苗离不开水一样。”
    沙洲坝村的农民洋溢着对共产党和毛主席的无限热爱。记者在到达该村的当天下午，就被乡农民协会主席杨世汉领着参观了当年毛主席的故居和前中央民主政府的旧址。毛主席故居的屋前屋后，都栽上了翠绿的松柏。在前中央民主政府旧址上，插着一块块木牌，木牌上写着当时各部门的名字。沙洲坝的农民们十分珍贵共产党和毛主席留下来的每一个历史痕迹。就连在一九三三年毛主席在村里时村中开凿的一口水井，现在井旁也竖起一块木牌，上面用红漆写着“喝水不忘开井人，时刻想念毛主席。”农民们说，自从有了这口井，村里人就再也不喝不干净的池水了。
    今年春天沙洲坝村家家户户都订立了爱国增产计划。全部稻田都要做到“三犁四耙，三耘二点（追肥）”。施肥要比往年增多三分之一到二分之一。现在，全村的水稻长得茂盛茁壮，今年丰收有望。沙洲坝村已有三十户农民自愿组织了三个互助组。他们正在研究改良耕作技术，提高产量的办法。劳动模范互助组长杨荣蓝，去年在花生地里试用一种经过制造的牛骨灰做肥料，一亩花生田比别人多收四百斤。现在，全乡农民都学会了这个办法。去年，青年团中央文化服务团来这里放映苏联农业生产新闻片以后，农民们对未来美满生活充满了信心。青年团员农民杨木生告诉记者说，他们的互助组准备在今年秋收后合买一架水车。他说：“好好努力生产吧，几年以后，工人老大哥会给我们制造机器，像苏联农民一样能用拖拉机耕田了。”他们相信：只要永远跟着共产党走，一定会创造更美好幸福的生活。
    “七一”前夕，全乡农民联合给毛主席的祝贺信中就写着：“在中国共产党和您的领导下，我们全乡农民开始恢复了瑞金民主政府时代的幸福生活。今后，我们一定更积极地努力发展生产，跟着您走向社会主义社会，像苏联老大哥一样。祝您万寿无疆。”
