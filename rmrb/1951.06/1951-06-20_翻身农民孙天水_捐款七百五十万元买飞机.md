　　Increase Production, Donate Airplanes and Cannons, Support the Volunteer Army in Fiercely Fighting the American Bandits

　　Turned-Over Peasant Sun Tianshui
    Donates Seven and a Half Million Yuan to Buy Airplanes
        Editor:
    Sun Tianshui, a peasant from Zhaoqu Village, Xiangling County, Shanxi Province, donated 7.5 million yuan from his family to purchase airplanes and cannons to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Sun Tianshui is a peasant who was liberated. Before liberation, he owned ten mu of land. Japanese devils and bandits such as Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan successively killed his oxen, demolished his house, and drove his whole family into the mountains, afraid to return.
    After Xiangling was liberated, he was emancipated under the leadership of the Communist Party and was allocated thirty mu of land and three houses. In the past two years, he has had enough to eat and wear.
    After hearing the news that the American devils occupied our Taiwan, invaded Korea, and were planning to arm Japan in an attempt to invade our great motherland, he felt extremely resentful. He actively participated in accusation meetings, denouncing the crimes of the Japanese devils and the Chiang and Yan bandits. He often said to others: "We have just started to live a good life, can we let the American devils come and kill us again?" Recently, when he heard the call from the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association to donate airplanes and cannons, he donated 7.5 million yuan on his own. This 7.5 million yuan is the entire amount he received from selling his house to the government to be used as a warehouse.

    捐款七百五十万元买飞机         编辑同志：
    山西襄陵县赵曲村农民孙天水，一家捐献了七百五十万元，购买飞机大炮，支援人民志愿军。孙天水是个翻身农民，在解放以前有十亩地。日本鬼子和蒋介石阎锡山等匪徒，曾先后杀死了他的犍牛，拆了他的房子，把他全家赶到山沟里不敢回来。
    襄陵解放后，他在共产党的领导下翻了身，分了三十亩地，三间房子，这两年来他已经有吃有穿了。
    他听到美国鬼子占我台湾，侵略朝鲜，又要武装日本企图侵略我们伟大祖国的消息后，他心里恨透了。他积极地参加了控诉会，控诉了日本鬼子及蒋匪、阎匪的罪恶。他常常向别人说：“咱的光景刚刚过好了，还能让美国鬼子再来杀害我们吗？”最近，他听到抗美援朝总会号召捐献飞机大炮的消息，他独自捐了七百五十万元。这七百五十万元，是他把房子卖给政府做仓库的全部价款。
